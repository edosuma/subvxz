worried about you.

You can tell just by looking
at her that she's a hand full.

02:32.674 --> 02:36.067
Besides, she'll be 18 soon

02:36.156 --> 02:38.680

You never told me
what to call her

weird for you sleeping

09:57.031 --> 09:58.859
in your mom's old room?

09:58.946 --> 10:01.644
- Nope, actually, I
wouldn't change it either,

10:01.731 --> 10:04.342
because it reminds me of her.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.257
Just like every day
I wear this ring

10:06.344 --> 10:07.781
because it was hers

10:07.868 --> 10:10.305
and it just makes me feel
closer to her, I guess.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.179
Do you think when
my mom was our age

10:15.266 --> 10:16.659
that we would have gotten along?

10:16.746 --> 10:18.618
That we would have been friends?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.750
I mean, do we look alike?

10:21.664 --> 10:23.013
[both laughing]

10:23.100 --> 10:25.363
- Uh, I mean, I
would never say that.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.409
But, uh, I don't know,

10:27.496 --> 10:29.193
it's kind of hard for
me to answer that,

10:29.280 --> 10:31.543
since my mom split when I was 2.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.197
Based off of the outfits,

10:33.284 --> 10:35.504
uh, I don't really know
if I would really say yes

10:35.591 --> 10:39.464
but, um, it makes me wonder
what they did for fun back then?

10:39.551 --> 10:40.727
- Cow tipping, for sure.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.946
- What?

10:43.033 --> 10:44.905
- You've never heard
of tipping cows?

10:44.992 --> 10:46.558
- Why would cows need
money, that's stupid.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.562
- [Chloe] [laughs] Oh my gosh.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.520
- What?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.130
- Nothing, no that's fine.

10:53.217 --> 10:54.654
- [Sticks] What?
[door knocks]

- I'll explain it to you
when your older. [laughs]

[door squeaks]
- [Chloe] Hello, grandma.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.050
- Hi, I brought you something

11:00.137 --> 11:03.227
that I thought you might like
to wear to church tomorrow.

11:03.314 --> 11:06.230
It was your mother's favorite
dress when she was your age.

11:06.317 --> 11:10.060
- Oh, wow, grandma.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.020
Oh, you want me to try it on?

11:13.107 --> 11:14.282
You want me, you want
me to see what, okay.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.152
- Yeah, go try it on.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.858
Grandma are you serious?

11:24.945 --> 11:26.598
I'm gonna look
ridiculous in this.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.123
- I'm gonna tell you the
same thing I told your mother

11:29.210 --> 11:33.214
when she wanted to wear
overalls to church one Sunday.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.042
When you're standing in church

11:35.129 --> 11:38.045
you are standing before
the throne of God,

11:38.132 --> 11:41.135
so don't you go
disrespecting Him

11:41.222 --> 11:44.529
by wearing the same thing
you'd wear out in the barn.

11:49.883 --> 11:53.713
Oh my, you don't know how much
you look like your mother,

11:56.019 --> 11:57.281
except for the hair.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.416
But, although, I think
she'd like blue hair.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.725
- All right, I'll wear it.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.948
- Now Sticks, there are
more dresses in the closet.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.255
- Yeah, Sticks, there are more
dresses for you to try on.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.736
- Uhh, you know, as
tempting as that sounds,

12:16.823 --> 12:19.521
I think I'm goin to have
to pass on that one.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.523
- Oh, and Chloe,
tomorrow for church

12:21.610 --> 12:24.744
would you PLEASE
tone down the makeup,

12:25.527 --> 12:28.617
and, uh, remove the fake tattoo.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.488
- Do you really hate
makeup that much grandma?

12:30.575 --> 12:31.968
- Oh Heavens no!

12:32.055 --> 12:34.492
I've just lived long
enough that I've learned,

12:34.579 --> 12:37.713
if the barn needs
painting, you paint it.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.933
You child just don't
need so much paint.

12:41.412 --> 12:44.764
Besides, I love you, no matter
what your hair looks like,

12:44.851 --> 12:48.028
or what your makeup looks like.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.639

need to give the women's

more to chat about.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.474

say your prayers.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.215

[Chloe sighs]

13:05.959 --> 13:07.787
Chloe, do you pray?

13:11.138 --> 13:14.141
- [Little Chloe] "Now
I lay me down to sleep,

13:14.228 --> 13:16.621
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,

13:18.885 --> 13:21.104
if Jesus comes before I wake,

13:22.671 --> 13:25.848
I pray the Lord my
soul to take, Amen."

13:35.945 --> 13:38.295
- Chloe, knock, knock.

13:38.382 --> 13:41.733
- [laughs] Sorry, uh, do I pray?

13:43.344 --> 13:44.824
I guess I don't really
know what to pray for

13:44.911 --> 13:48.697
because the thing that I
want the most is impossible.

13:48.784 --> 13:52.744
- Well, if you were to
pray, how do you pray?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.746
Are there like rules?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.618
And like certain
ways of doing it?

13:56.705 --> 13:58.620
I don't know, maybe
we're doing it wrong.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.317
- Why, what do you pray for?

14:00.404 --> 14:04.800
- Well, when I was a kid,
everyone, and I mean everyone,

14:04.887 --> 14:06.758
in my neighborhood was
getting new bicycles,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.718
and so um, my birthday
was coming up,

14:09.805 --> 14:11.502
and I went to go
visit my grandma

14:11.589 --> 14:12.939
and whenever I went
to go visit her,

14:13.026 --> 14:15.898
she would always make me
go to church with her.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.900
And I distinctly
remember one Sunday,

14:17.987 --> 14:21.686
the preacher said, "Ask
and it shall be given,"

14:21.773 --> 14:25.386
So right then and there I
prayed that if God was real,

14:25.473 --> 14:28.215
I would get a new bicycle for
my birthday, preferably red.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.129
- Of course.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.478
- So I thought to myself,

14:30.565 --> 14:33.176
well, you know,
if I pray for this

14:33.263 --> 14:36.049
and it comes true, that
means that God is real,

14:36.136 --> 14:38.486
and then, on top of it,
I'll get a new bicycle.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.622
- So, what did you get?

14:45.797 --> 14:47.669
- [sighs] Drums.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.236
- [laughs] Your stupid.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.846
- What?

14:50.933 --> 14:53.022
- You do realize that God
is not Santa Clause, right?

14:54.632 --> 14:55.372
- Well...

14:57.157 --> 14:58.506
- If you got a bike,

14:58.593 --> 15:00.464
you wouldn't be as
awesome of a drummer

15:00.551 --> 15:02.292
as you are right now, you know?

15:03.467 --> 15:04.773
I mean, my Grandma
always tells me

15:04.860 --> 15:06.427
that God doesn't always
give what you want,

15:06.514 --> 15:08.429
but He does give
you what you need.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.170
- Oh, well.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.523
[gasps] I just
realized something.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.699

22:22.384 --> 22:23.429
- [Chloe] Hmm Hmm!

22:23.516 --> 22:24.473
- Thank you darling!

22:25.866 --> 22:29.391
- "James, a bond servant of God

22:29.478 --> 22:31.262
and of the Lord Jesus Christ,

22:31.350 --> 22:34.527
to the twelve tribes who
are dispersed abroad.

22:34.614 --> 22:39.619
Greetings, consider it
pure joy, my brothers,

22:40.750 --> 22:44.232
when you encounter
trials of many kinds,

22:44.319 --> 22:48.497
knowing that the testing of
your faith produces endurance.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.850
And let the endurance
have it's perfect result

22:53.937 --> 22:57.941
that you may be mature and
complete, lacking in nothing."

22:59.334 --> 23:01.684
[soft music]

23:04.252 --> 23:05.645
- Chloe, what's the matter?

23:09.866 --> 23:13.914
- He says to count it pure
joy when you face trials.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.306
- Yes.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.264
- Is he...

23:18.266 --> 23:20.311
Is he nuts or am I just stupid?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.619
No, just listen grandma, okay?

23:27.318 --> 23:31.192
You say God has a plan
for everything, right?

23:31.279 --> 23:32.411
- [Grandma Sharon] Yes.

23:34.282 --> 23:38.678
- Okay, tell me exactly how
taking my parents away from me

23:38.765 --> 23:40.244
works out in His great plan.

23:43.857 --> 23:48.818
I have asked myself
over and over, why.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.605
- Baby, right now you
are just going through

23:52.692 --> 23:54.302
one of those mountains in life.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.738
We all have them.

23:58.045 --> 24:01.222
I faced some of my
toughest mountains myself,

24:01.309 --> 24:03.006
when my folks past away,

24:05.226 --> 24:07.358
and when your
granddaddy past away.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.537
And your mamma and daddy.

24:13.582 --> 24:17.020
And poor ole Biscuit his
been moping around here

24:17.107 --> 24:18.805
ever since Gravy past on.

24:21.372 --> 24:24.332
Mountains are also hard
decisions we have to make.

24:25.855 --> 24:27.640
But baby, God can give
you the strength to climb

24:27.727 --> 24:31.208
that mountain or
you can just let it

24:31.295 --> 24:32.862
stop you in your tracks.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.128
That choice will
always be yours.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.307
But I know in my heart you
will make the right decision.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.227
[Chloe crying]

24:53.840 --> 24:55.537
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.281
You know, how about later today

25:01.456 --> 25:03.850
we go down to your secret garden

25:03.937 --> 25:05.634
and we fix ourselves a picnic.

25:06.461 --> 25:11.379
[soft music]
[Biscuit huffing]

25:17.820 --> 25:19.343
These are just for you Biscuit.

25:22.477 --> 25:25.872
- Hey grandma, do you
still think about Grandpa?

25:27.047 --> 25:29.049
- Oh goodness, I think
about him everyday.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.618
[soft music]
[birds chirping]

25:32.705 --> 25:36.012
- But with time, the
pain it fades away

25:37.536 --> 25:39.973
but the memories of the
things he used to do,

25:40.060 --> 25:41.409
[water splashing]

25:41.496 --> 25:45.152
oh, my goodness, [laughs]
those make me smile.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.547
[soft music]

25:50.418 --> 25:52.420
- I don't think I'm
ever get to that point.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.336
The memories that I do have.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.513
It's been a long time.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.039
It's kind of stupid, but,
well, I still feel broken

26:06.434 --> 26:09.219
- Let me tell you
a story [chuckles]

26:09.306 --> 26:11.700
and it's not from the Bible.

26:11.787 --> 26:14.311
[soft music]

26:18.228 --> 26:22.276
Once, there was a water
bearer who had two large pots.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.713
Each pot hung on
the end of a pole,

26:24.800 --> 26:26.410
which he carried
across his neck.

26:28.064 --> 26:32.852
Everyday he would walk from
the stream to his house.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.637
Now one pot was perfect,

26:37.030 --> 26:39.467
and the other pot was cracked.

26:41.077 --> 26:45.821
So everyday as he went from
the stream to his house,

26:47.040 --> 26:49.390
the cracked pot leaked
all the way up there.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.699
Of course the perfect
pot was proud of itself

26:54.613 --> 26:57.267
but the poor cracked
pot felt ashamed,

26:57.354 --> 26:59.008
miserable, and even angry.

27:00.706 --> 27:04.448
After years of feeling
like a bitter failure,

27:04.535 --> 27:06.494
it finally spoke to
the water bearer.

27:08.322 --> 27:11.064
"I am cracked and broken.

27:11.151 --> 27:12.935
I'm useless and miserable".

27:14.067 --> 27:15.372
The bearer said to the pot,

27:17.070 --> 27:19.899
"Did you notice the flowers
on your side of the path,

27:19.986 --> 27:21.683
but not on the other side?

27:22.858 --> 27:26.209
That's because I have always
known about your flaw,

27:26.296 --> 27:29.778
and I planted flower
seeds on your side.

27:29.865 --> 27:33.173
So every day as we walk from
the stream to the house,

27:33.260 --> 27:35.436
you've watered those flowers.

27:35.523 --> 27:39.570
Now I have beautiful flowers
to decorate to grace my house."

27:41.050 --> 27:42.835
We are all cracked,

27:42.922 --> 27:44.663
but God's like the water bearer.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.362
He knows what's going to happen

27:48.449 --> 27:51.278
and He prepares
us, if we let Him.

27:52.453 --> 27:53.541
- So what?

27:53.628 --> 27:54.498
Are you a cracked pot, Grandma?

27:54.585 --> 27:55.978
[both laughing]

27:56.065 --> 28:00.461
- Honey, I'm cracked,
chipped, broken, repaired

28:01.592 --> 28:03.551
and my paint is peeling,

28:03.638 --> 28:05.118
[Chloe laughs]

28:05.205 --> 28:07.424
but God can still use me.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.039
- So you miss Grandpa,

28:13.126 --> 28:15.389
and I miss my parents

28:16.433 --> 28:18.653
and Biscuit misses Gravy.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.701
I guess we all have cracks, huh.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.139
Where'd you here
that story anyways?

28:27.183 --> 28:28.097
- I goobled it.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.709
[Chloe laughs]

28:36.976 --> 28:39.152
I know you want some treats.

since, since Grandma died.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.733
I surely appreciate it.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.301
- It's no problem,
he's a good dog.

35:29.388 --> 35:32.391
And besides, my wife would
love somebody to dote on

35:32.478 --> 35:34.828
since the kids have
all moved out now.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.264
Hey, speaking of my wife,

35:36.351 --> 35:38.179
she makes a mean lemonade,
would you like some?

35:38.266 --> 35:38.962
- Yeah.

35:39.049 --> 35:40.094
- Alright.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.316
- So Chloe, how ya doing?

35:44.403 --> 35:47.057
Are you anxious or excited
about starting school?

35:48.842 --> 35:53.803
- Um, well, actually, I don't
think I'm gonna fit in there.

35:56.763 --> 36:00.158
- God has a special purpose
and a plan for you, Chloe.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.161
- What is it?

36:04.205 --> 36:06.251
- That's for you to find out.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.818
[Rock music]

36:33.147 --> 36:35.932
[car door bangs]

36:40.198 --> 36:41.590
- Hey, what's up?

36:43.244 --> 36:45.028
- Hi, may I help
you with something?

36:45.115 --> 36:49.032
- Uh, I think her name
is, uh, Ms. Bethel.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.686
- It's Mrs. Bethel.

36:50.773 --> 36:51.470
You must be Chloe.

36:51.557 --> 36:52.558
- Uh uh.

36:52.645 --> 36:53.472
- Hi

36:53.559 --> 36:54.821
So, I need to let you know

36:54.908 --> 36:56.736
we have a 10pm
curfew on weekdays,

36:56.823 --> 36:58.694
a midnight curfew on Fridays

36:58.781 --> 37:00.479
and 11pm on Saturdays.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.569
- Wait, okay, by curfew,
though, you mean, like,

37:03.656 --> 37:05.223
like on the campus by that hour?

37:05.310 --> 37:07.181
- No, I mean you need
to be in your room.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.227
And if you're late,
that's a demerit.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.967
- How many demerits
can I get again?

37:11.054 --> 37:12.534
- 24.

37:12.621 --> 37:15.145
Perhaps you should read
your handbook at page 24,

37:15.233 --> 37:17.496
that's the demerit section.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.498
Oh. we also have Chapel
Monday through Friday.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.064
- I think I'll pass.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.197
I'll probably be busy
studying or something, right?

37:23.284 --> 37:25.025
- It's at 8:00am,

37:25.112 --> 37:27.332
and it's mandatory
for all students.

37:27.419 --> 37:28.811
Let's go see the campus.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.119
[soft music]

37:32.206 --> 37:32.989
- Oh, Good Morning, Mrs. Johnson

37:33.076 --> 37:34.687
- Ms. Bethel.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.079
- I'd like you to meet Chloe.

37:36.166 --> 37:39.561
She will be rooming
here, room 326.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.955
Chloe, Mrs. Johnson
is your dorm mother.

37:42.042 --> 37:43.086
- Nice to meet you Chloe.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.829
Just mind the rules in this book

37:46.916 --> 37:47.830
and you'll be fine.

37:50.180 --> 37:53.314
You know, a lot of kids
think they can get away

37:53.401 --> 37:54.228
with stuff with me,

37:54.315 --> 37:56.665
but I was young once too.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.756
- Mommy, is that a zombie?

38:00.843 --> 38:02.236
- Sh sh sh.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.020
- Okay, Chloe, so
over here to our left

38:04.107 --> 38:05.761
we have our tennis courts,

38:05.848 --> 38:08.111
and just to the right
of that is our chapel.

38:08.198 --> 38:09.374
That's where they have
our chapel services

38:09.461 --> 38:10.984
I was talking about earlier.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.507
Hello?

38:12.594 --> 38:14.509
Okay and then just
back beyond our chapel

38:14.596 --> 38:15.597
we have our auditorium.

38:15.684 --> 38:17.512
Well, are you excited?

38:18.557 --> 38:20.210
- Yeah, sure.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.169
- Let's go inside and
go up to your room.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.042
Welcome to your new home.

38:27.957 --> 38:28.697
After you.

38:30.264 --> 38:32.135
Your on the third floor.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.050
Well, the elevator is broken.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.138
It breaks down a lot.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.314
This building is old.

38:45.105 --> 38:49.936
[playful music]
[both panting]

38:51.024 --> 38:51.894
- Just think what great
shape you'll be in

38:51.981 --> 38:52.634
by the end of the year.

38:59.162 --> 39:01.426
Here we are, 326.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.297
[door knocks]

39:03.384 --> 39:05.691
Your roommate might
already be here.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.475
[door squeaks]

39:07.562 --> 39:10.260
- Hi, Mrs. Bethel,
what brings you here?

39:10.348 --> 39:12.872
- Hi, Maddy, I'd like you to
meet your new roommate, Chloe.

39:12.959 --> 39:13.742
- Hi.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.619
- I've got your
schedule right here.

39:20.706 --> 39:23.491
Don't worry you're
in good hands.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.581
I've got to get
back to the office.

39:26.668 --> 39:29.279
Chloe, don't hesitate to
call me if you need anything.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.325
- Okay, bye.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.979
- [Mrs. Bethel] Bye.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.464
- I can help you decorate
your side if you want.

39:39.551 --> 39:43.076
- Uh, no, I'm kind of
a minimalist, I'm good.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.860
- Well, I can help you unpack

39:44.947 --> 39:47.428
and then we can
go get your books.

39:47.515 --> 39:49.169
- All my stuff is in the truck.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.000
- Okay, well, let's go!

39:55.958 --> 39:59.266
[playful music]

39:59.353 --> 40:01.094
[footsteps approaching]

40:01.181 --> 40:02.443
Oh, Let me see your schedule.

40:04.750 --> 40:08.231
Math, English, Home
& Family. [laughs]

40:08.318 --> 40:09.929
Mr. Peters in Home and Family

40:10.016 --> 40:13.019
requires that you
memorize 100 Bible verses

40:13.106 --> 40:15.891
and quote them by the
end of the semester.

40:15.978 --> 40:16.675
- What!

40:16.762 --> 40:17.458
A hundred verses?

40:17.545 --> 40:19.417
- I know, right?

40:19.504 --> 40:21.680
However, for every
date you go on,

40:21.767 --> 40:24.378
with a different
person, he waives 10!

40:24.465 --> 40:27.903
So, if you date 10 boys, you
don't have to memorize any!

40:29.514 --> 40:31.298
- Do they have to
go to this school?

40:31.385 --> 40:34.257
- I don't know, that's
a really good question.

40:34.344 --> 40:36.346
Anyways, I wish all
my teachers did that.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.261
We could just date all semester

40:38.348 --> 40:39.567
and have no homework!

40:40.916 --> 40:45.443
Oh, look, no, don't look,
over there is Josh Miller.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.923
Isn't he adorable!

40:48.010 --> 40:49.925
He would definitely
be one of my ten.

40:50.012 --> 40:50.752
Come on.

40:53.538 --> 40:56.192
You know we do have
a dress code here.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.281
- Yep, I've been told.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.283
- I'll be happy to give
you a wardrobe check.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.242
After we get your books
we can unpack your car

41:02.329 --> 41:03.548
and put your stuff away.

41:05.941 --> 41:09.249
Oh dear, we don't have
one single class together!

41:10.293 --> 41:11.120
- That's a shame.

41:12.948 --> 41:15.211
[door opens]

41:15.298 --> 41:16.735
- Mrs. Cooper is the best.

41:16.822 --> 41:19.259
And you'll just love her
granddaughter, Nechelle.

41:19.346 --> 41:20.869
[footsteps approaching]

41:20.956 --> 41:22.523
Good Morning, Mrs. Cooper.

41:22.610 --> 41:23.959
- Hi.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.961
- I'd like you to meet
my new roommate, Chloe.

41:26.048 --> 41:27.572
- Welcome, Chloe.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.356
Why don't you let me take
a look at your schedule.

41:30.749 --> 41:33.534
- Ooh, there's
Megan and Jennifer.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.014
I'll be right back.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.105
[Chloe sighs]

41:39.192 --> 41:41.063
- If we could harness
the energy of that one,

41:41.150 --> 41:43.065
we'd solve the world's
energy problem.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.676
- No kidding.

41:44.763 --> 41:47.766
- So some of your books
won't be here till tomorrow.

41:47.853 --> 41:51.770
Um, Nechelle, can you help
Chloe here with her books?

41:51.857 --> 41:52.640
This is my daughter, Nechelle.

41:52.727 --> 41:54.468
Nechelle, this is Chloe.

41:54.555 --> 41:56.862
- Hi, Chloe, welcome to CCU.

41:56.949 --> 41:57.645
- Thanks.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.387
- So, I see you've met Maddy.

42:00.474 --> 42:02.345
- Yeah, roommate.

42:02.432 --> 42:04.739
- She's very nice. [chuckles]

42:04.826 --> 42:06.480
She talks pretty fast and a lot

42:06.567 --> 42:08.177
but you could do much worse.

42:08.264 --> 42:09.309
[both laughing]

42:09.396 --> 42:12.051
So, where are you from?

42:12.138 --> 42:14.270
- Um, well, if you look
on a map where there is,

42:14.357 --> 42:16.490
like, little to no civilization

42:16.577 --> 42:19.232
and I'm smack dab in
the middle of that.

42:19.319 --> 42:20.886
- [laughs] I know how you feel.

42:20.973 --> 42:23.279
I'm from a small
village in Sierra Leone.

42:23.366 --> 42:24.237
- What?

42:24.324 --> 42:25.717
How did you end up here?

42:25.804 --> 42:28.720
- Short story, my parents
died when I was young.

42:28.807 --> 42:31.113
And then when I was six, I
was adopted by missionaries,

42:31.200 --> 42:32.550
but they died too.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.552
I've been living with
Miss Cooper ever since.

42:36.336 --> 42:37.598
- I'm sorry about that.

42:37.685 --> 42:40.383
- Oh, you don't
need to be sorry.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.385
Living with Miss
Cooper is a blessing.

42:43.517 --> 42:47.477
She's my rock, actually,
she's a lot of kids'.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.437
You could consider
her a campus mom.

42:51.394 --> 42:52.395
You know what?

42:52.482 --> 42:54.528
Consider us your family

42:54.615 --> 42:57.705
so if you have any holidays,
long weekends, et cetera,

42:57.792 --> 42:59.707
you're spending them with us.

42:59.794 --> 43:01.927
Mom, we're adopting Chloe.

43:02.014 --> 43:02.928
[Chloe laughing]

43:03.015 --> 43:04.625
- Well, the more the merrier.

43:05.408 --> 43:07.062
- Sure is a one stop shop, huh.

43:07.149 --> 43:11.023
- [laughs] Well, since
you're family now,

43:11.110 --> 43:12.154
you should come over for dinner,

43:12.241 --> 43:13.939
so we can get to
know each other.

43:14.026 --> 43:17.029
- Well, I, uh, I got to unpack,

43:17.116 --> 43:19.292
and, I gotta be back
by 10 any ways, so.

43:20.510 --> 43:22.817
- [chuckles] I see you
got that demerit thing

43:22.904 --> 43:24.036
in control already.

43:24.123 --> 43:24.993
- Aww!

43:26.168 --> 43:29.781
- Well, dinner's a 7,
if you change your mind.

43:29.868 --> 43:31.783
We live right across
from the bookstore.

43:36.701 --> 43:38.006
[birds chirping]

43:38.093 --> 43:40.052
- So, uh, where's your car?

43:41.140 --> 43:43.316
- Uh, that truck over there.

43:43.403 --> 43:47.625
- Oh, how uh, retro.

43:49.061 --> 43:50.845
[Chloe sighs]

43:50.932 --> 43:52.325
[upbeat music]

43:52.412 --> 43:53.587
So where's your stuff?

43:56.459 --> 43:58.157
Oh, that's it?

43:58.244 --> 44:00.072
- Yep, I like to travel light.

44:02.204 --> 44:02.988
Got it?

44:03.075 --> 44:05.643
[Rock music]

44:14.564 --> 44:18.133
- Chloe, ripped jeans, really?

44:18.220 --> 44:20.483
[Rock music]

45:04.179 --> 45:07.226
[car engine roaring]

45:17.584 --> 45:20.500
[car door bangs]

45:22.545 --> 45:23.590
- What?

45:30.945 --> 45:31.729
Bag.

45:35.558 --> 45:37.082
- Hi, Chloe, how's it going?

45:37.169 --> 45:38.213
- It's okay.

45:38.300 --> 45:39.519
It could be a lot worse.

45:39.606 --> 45:41.695
I could have to memorize
like 200 verses.

45:41.782 --> 45:43.697
That would really suck.

45:44.567 --> 45:45.481
- You know, you should come over

45:45.568 --> 45:46.569
to my house for dinner tonight

45:46.656 --> 45:48.615
and I could help you out.

45:48.702 --> 45:53.576
- Ah, well I have friends
coming over for this thing.

45:54.447 --> 45:55.709
I really can't.

45:56.884 --> 46:00.192
- Okay, well, if anything
changes, you know where I live.

46:04.152 --> 46:04.892
- Chloe!

46:07.982 --> 46:09.331
I'll text her again.

46:09.418 --> 46:10.680
- Where are you from?

46:10.768 --> 46:12.639
- We are from the
band, Eight Feet Under.

46:12.726 --> 46:16.469
- Yeah, because six feet
was not enough. [laughs]

46:16.556 --> 46:17.687
- Who are you here to see?

46:17.775 --> 46:18.558
- Oh, Chloe.

46:19.428 --> 46:20.603
- Chloe, yeah.

46:22.170 --> 46:26.348
- [Sticks] Come on guys,
I bet you it's this way.

46:26.435 --> 46:27.219
Chloe!

46:28.176 --> 46:30.744
[both laughing]

46:31.876 --> 46:32.746
- I missed you.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.530
- Stop, what are you doing?

46:34.617 --> 46:35.575
- What?

46:35.662 --> 46:36.445
- Come on.

46:37.533 --> 46:38.273
- What did I do?

46:38.360 --> 46:39.057
- Hello again.

46:39.144 --> 46:40.101
- You guys met?

46:40.188 --> 46:41.581
- Yeah, earlier.

46:41.668 --> 46:43.757
- Chloe, you know the rules.

46:45.890 --> 46:46.716
- 3 demerits?

46:46.804 --> 46:48.414
Hey, are you serious?

46:49.328 --> 46:50.111
Come on!

46:50.198 --> 46:50.982
- Hey what's that?

46:51.069 --> 46:51.809
Can I have one too?

46:53.114 --> 46:54.855
- 3 demerits for PDA?

46:54.942 --> 46:56.639

46:59.817 --> 47:01.427
- What does that mean,
public display of affection?

47:01.514 --> 47:02.820
- It means, that if I
get one more of these

47:02.907 --> 47:04.212
by the last day of the semester,

47:04.299 --> 47:05.735
then I get booted
out of this place.

47:09.565 --> 47:11.567
I just won't touch you
until after tomorrow.

How is that gonna work?

make it disappear?

you, don't you think?

to live with this.

it if it happens.

wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

51:57.810 --> 52:00.726
or anything, but why
would you get kicked out?

tomorrow, what happened?

hug and almost kiss

and she got three stupid
demerits from the stupid police.

Can you explain that, please?

52:35.848 --> 52:39.895
- Okay, the PDA
wasn't like PDA, PDA.

52:39.982 --> 52:44.117
It was a friend I hadn't
seen in a really long time.

52:44.204 --> 52:48.165
It was weird, but, it
was innocent, I promise.

52:49.601 --> 52:50.993
- I believe you.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.343
The problem that we have, Chloe,

52:52.430 --> 52:54.867
is that you have 24 demerits.

52:54.954 --> 52:56.390
Demerit after demerit,

52:56.477 --> 52:58.958

the exception of the PDA,

trying to fit in here, right.

53:06.357 --> 53:07.140

53:08.272 --> 53:11.144

out that last night

53:11.231 --> 53:13.146
you had a tough choice
to make, didn't you?

53:14.800 --> 53:16.497
- I don't understand.

stopped to help Nechelle.

the side of the road.

You were on your
way back to school.

53:23.504 --> 53:26.333

could have driven past her

53:26.420 --> 53:28.074
and got back here in time,

53:28.161 --> 53:30.511
and avoided yet another demerit

53:30.598 --> 53:34.907
but you chose to risk getting
another demerit to stop

53:34.994 --> 53:36.387
and help somebody in need.

53:36.474 --> 53:38.389

it was really safe

if she was out there all
alone like that, I don't know.

53:42.306 --> 53:44.351

night was more important

53:44.438 --> 53:45.874

53:45.961 --> 53:48.007

Jesus spoke of when he said,

neighbor as yourself".

have been very proud of you.

she'd be so proud

out in the first semester.

56:51.408 --> 56:52.409
- [Many] Amen.

56:54.759 --> 56:56.630
- So, Chloe, what kind of
classes are you taking?

56:56.717 --> 56:58.763
- Um, pretty much
just general courses.

56:58.850 --> 57:00.286
- What's the matter?

57:00.373 --> 57:01.766
Don't you know what you
wanna be when you grow up?

57:01.853 --> 57:04.116
- I don't really want
to grow up, I guess.

57:04.203 --> 57:08.381
Um, no, but I did just
finish a very weird class.

57:08.468 --> 57:11.428
It was about dating,
according to my roommate.

57:11.515 --> 57:13.865
- [Joshua And Caleb]
Home and Family!

57:13.952 --> 57:14.866
[many laughing]

57:14.953 --> 57:17.521
- I had to memorize 80 verses.

57:17.608 --> 57:19.740
- So you did go on
a couple of dates.

57:19.827 --> 57:21.786
- Um, I cheated a little bit,

57:21.873 --> 57:23.352
with some friends of mine.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.876
It wasn't really a date.

57:24.963 --> 57:26.355
- With who?

57:26.443 --> 57:28.140
We promise, we will
never tell. [laughs]

57:28.227 --> 57:30.751
- I would have willingly
sacrificed myself as well,

57:30.838 --> 57:32.927
for the common good, of course.

57:36.235 --> 57:38.019
- Well, here's to Chloe,

57:38.106 --> 57:39.673
welcome to the Island
of Misfit Toys.

57:39.760 --> 57:40.718
[Nechelle giggles]

57:40.805 --> 57:42.067
- It's kind of a inside joke.

57:42.154 --> 57:43.590
Last year we were
watching a film

57:43.677 --> 57:46.637
about where the broken
toys go. [chuckles]

57:46.724 --> 57:48.508
Actually, we'll watch
it during winter break,

57:48.595 --> 57:50.336
its better than
trying to explain it.

57:50.423 --> 57:52.947
- Sounds like a good
movie, my kind of island.

57:54.427 --> 57:56.342
- Well, then, here's
to the Misfits.

57:58.300 --> 58:01.216
[glasses clanking]

58:02.435 --> 58:03.392
- Hey, thanks for
dinner momma Coop.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.264
It was delicious as usual.

58:05.351 --> 58:07.222
Is there dessert by chance?

58:07.309 --> 58:08.789
- I baked two pies.

58:08.876 --> 58:12.184
One for you and one
for everyone else.

58:12.271 --> 58:13.968
[door knocks]

58:14.055 --> 58:17.450
[footsteps approaching]

58:18.843 --> 58:20.235
- Guess what?

58:20.322 --> 58:22.368
- You'll never guess,
okay, so give up?

58:22.455 --> 58:25.284
CCU is hosting this year's
Songfest Fellowship Competition!

58:25.371 --> 58:27.329
- And, as you know, they
are having open auditions,

58:27.416 --> 58:28.330
anyone can enter.

58:28.417 --> 58:30.463
- So, I entered us.

58:30.550 --> 58:31.203
- Who?

58:31.290 --> 58:32.073
- Wait, Who?

58:32.160 --> 58:33.858
- Us, the Misfits.

58:33.945 --> 58:34.815
- I thought that was a joke!

58:34.902 --> 58:36.295
- When is the competition?

58:36.382 --> 58:38.340
- It's near the end
of the school year.

58:38.427 --> 58:39.777
- Come on, it will be fun.

58:39.864 --> 58:41.692
We will kick their butts!

58:41.779 --> 58:43.476
- Just what everyone in a
Christian Singing Competition

58:43.563 --> 58:45.130
aspires to do.

58:45.217 --> 58:48.307
- Okay, we'll cal citrate
their gluteus maximuses.

58:48.394 --> 58:49.482
- Yeah!

58:49.569 --> 58:51.353
What he said.

58:51.440 --> 58:55.488
- Come on, it will keep me
out of trouble, mostly, maybe.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.666
We can practice on the weekends.

58:59.753 --> 59:02.539
- Don't look at me, I'm not
doing it if she's not doing it.

59:03.801 --> 59:06.412
- Okay, I'm in.

59:06.499 --> 59:07.544
- [Joshua And Caleb] Yes!

59:08.501 --> 59:11.809
[Caleb and Joshua humming]

59:11.896 --> 59:13.288
- Okay, if I were
you guys I would keep

59:13.375 --> 59:15.421
that swinging
action to a minimum.

59:15.508 --> 59:16.335
I'm pretty sure they
give out demerits

59:16.422 --> 59:17.379
for that kind of thing.

59:21.470 --> 59:24.996
- We need something that no
one has ever done before.

59:25.083 --> 59:26.954
- Something different.

59:28.608 --> 59:30.567
- [chuckles] That's
what I just said.

59:30.654 --> 59:33.787
- Something simple,
yet powerful.

59:33.874 --> 59:36.660
- Okay, well, whenever
I'm trying write a song

59:36.747 --> 59:40.489
I usually just write
down everything that
I'm trying to say,

59:40.577 --> 59:41.621
and all the words
that pop into my head.

59:41.708 --> 59:42.535
- You write songs?

59:42.622 --> 59:43.971
- I've written a few.

59:44.058 --> 59:45.320
I wrote most of the
songs for my band.

59:45.407 --> 59:47.148
- You have a band? [chuckles]

59:47.235 --> 59:48.672
- Yeah. [giggles]

59:48.759 --> 59:51.631
- I vote that Chloe write
the song, all in favor?

59:53.981 --> 59:56.418
- No. [giggles]

59:56.505 --> 1:00:01.380
[sighs] Okay, well, um, what
are we gonna write about?

1:00:01.467 --> 1:00:03.948
- Oh, I know, Jesus.

1:00:04.035 --> 1:00:05.863
- Okay, what about Him?

1:00:05.950 --> 1:00:07.604
I need some input.

1:00:08.430 --> 1:00:11.042
[phone rings]

1:00:12.739 --> 1:00:13.784
Hang on guys, I've
got to take this.

1:00:13.871 --> 1:00:15.437
I'll be right back.

1:00:15.524 --> 1:00:17.526
[footsteps departing]

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:19.485
- So, what about Jesus?

1:00:20.573 --> 1:00:22.401
- I love Him. [laughs]

1:00:22.488 --> 1:00:26.492
- Hello, Sticks, hey. [giggles]

1:00:26.579 --> 1:00:31.671
Yeah, what, what? [giggles]

1:00:31.932 --> 1:00:33.455
No way!

1:00:33.542 --> 1:00:36.502
Oh, my gosh, yes, yes,
yes, yes, I will be there.

1:00:38.286 --> 1:00:42.377
Don't worry, I my fingers
limber, I remember everything.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:46.817
Okay, oh my gosh, I'm
so excited. [giggles]

1:00:46.904 --> 1:00:48.427
Alright, well, give Wrench a hug

1:00:48.514 --> 1:00:50.821
and Lucky a smack on the
head for me, would you?

1:00:50.908 --> 1:00:51.648
Thank you.

1:00:52.866 --> 1:00:54.302
All right, thanks for calling.

1:00:54.389 --> 1:00:55.652
I'll see ya, [giggles] bye!

1:00:57.654 --> 1:01:00.352
[laughs] Oh, that's good!

1:01:00.439 --> 1:01:01.614
Um, that was Sticks.

1:01:01.701 --> 1:01:03.790
She's the drummer in the band.

1:01:03.877 --> 1:01:04.617
- The Band?

1:01:04.704 --> 1:01:06.227
- Yeah, the band.

1:01:06.314 --> 1:01:09.578
Um, they just made finals
in a band competition

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:11.798
with a song that I wrote.

1:01:11.885 --> 1:01:14.105
- [Caleb] Nice.
- Wow, congrats girl!

1:01:14.192 --> 1:01:16.890
- I'm pretty pumped about it.

1:01:16.977 --> 1:01:18.500
Um, I promised them though,

1:01:18.587 --> 1:01:20.633
that if they had a
gig anywhere near here

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:21.982
that I would play with them

1:01:22.069 --> 1:01:25.159
and the finals are
being held here.

1:01:25.246 --> 1:01:26.073
- Sweet!

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:27.684
- I'm super excited.

1:01:27.771 --> 1:01:32.689
[giggles] Okay, um, well,
where were we, sorry?

1:01:35.387 --> 1:01:36.170
- Jesus!

1:01:38.085 --> 1:01:40.348
- Okay, what are we
going to write about him?

1:01:41.219 --> 1:01:41.959
- Awesome.

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:44.439
- Blessed.

1:01:45.745 --> 1:01:47.529
- Compassionate.

1:01:47.616 --> 1:01:48.617
- [Joshua] Deliverer.

1:01:50.228 --> 1:01:52.839
- [chuckles] Awesome,
blessed, compassionate,

1:01:54.058 --> 1:01:56.930
it's like the ABC's
of God guys. [laughs]

1:01:58.018 --> 1:01:59.063
But, I don't know.

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:03.458
I just remember something
my grandma always told me.

1:02:03.545 --> 1:02:06.635
That you can't label God.

1:02:08.289 --> 1:02:10.552
You can't put God in a box.

1:02:12.293 --> 1:02:14.513
That God is not this,

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:15.906
and God is not that

1:02:18.952 --> 1:02:22.564
but that He is so much
bigger than any label

1:02:22.651 --> 1:02:25.872
that you can put on Him.

1:02:27.047 --> 1:02:31.051
But, I don't know, I mean that's
just what my grandma said.

1:02:31.138 --> 1:02:32.618
Whatever, it's stupid.

1:02:34.663 --> 1:02:37.754
- Actually Chloe,
that's brilliant.

1:02:39.538 --> 1:02:42.019
[guitar music]

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:48.634
- Ugh, why am I having such
a hard time with this song?

1:02:48.721 --> 1:02:50.244
I've never had such a
mental block before.

1:02:50.331 --> 1:02:52.507
I mean, usually the
words just come out

1:02:52.594 --> 1:02:54.031
so easily, you know, ahhh.

1:02:56.729 --> 1:02:59.514
- Well, maybe it's
because you're not
really invested in it.

1:02:59.601 --> 1:03:00.602
- What? [laughs]

1:03:00.689 --> 1:03:01.995
What's that suppose to mean?

1:03:02.082 --> 1:03:03.910
I really wanna do this.

1:03:03.997 --> 1:03:06.086
- I didn't mean to
imply that you didn't,

1:03:06.173 --> 1:03:09.698
but when you write your
songs, are you inspired?

1:03:10.699 --> 1:03:12.179
Where does it come from?

1:03:12.266 --> 1:03:13.659
- I usually just think about

1:03:13.746 --> 1:03:15.748
whatever it is that
I'm struggling with

1:03:15.835 --> 1:03:17.663
or feel drawn to,

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:20.100
and what it is I'm trying
to say about it, I guess.

1:03:21.710 --> 1:03:23.756
- I think you need some
good old fashioned input.

1:03:23.843 --> 1:03:24.713
[both laughing]

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:26.193
- Input, come on. [giggles]

1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:27.673
You guys have given
me so much input.

1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:30.415
- I'm maxed out on
input right now, Okay?

1:03:30.502 --> 1:03:35.463
- But, do you feel it,
understand it, believe it?

1:03:39.728 --> 1:03:41.774
- Well, what do you suggest?

1:03:42.819 --> 1:03:44.646
- Reading. [chuckles]

1:03:44.733 --> 1:03:45.517
- What?

1:03:46.692 --> 1:03:47.649
- The B I B L E.

1:03:47.736 --> 1:03:50.261
[both laughing]

1:03:50.348 --> 1:03:51.088
- What?

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:55.832
- No, really, it's
what gets me through.

1:03:55.919 --> 1:03:58.835
The Bible, I stand
alone on the Bible.

1:04:00.053 --> 1:04:03.709
- [sighs] All right,
I've read the Bible,

1:04:03.796 --> 1:04:05.189
plenty of times [giggling].

1:04:06.843 --> 1:04:09.628
My grandma she used to
pretend that she couldn't see

1:04:09.715 --> 1:04:11.369
well enough to read anymore

1:04:11.456 --> 1:04:13.458
and would make me sit for hours

1:04:13.545 --> 1:04:14.938
and try to just read it to her.

1:04:15.025 --> 1:04:16.853
She was so sneaky.

1:04:18.898 --> 1:04:21.379
- But did you read
it to understand it?

1:04:21.466 --> 1:04:23.468
Or did you just read
it to please her?

1:04:26.514 --> 1:04:28.386
No one can give you faith.

1:04:28.473 --> 1:04:33.521
It's not something you just
feel, like most people think.

1:04:34.740 --> 1:04:36.873
You can only gain it by
hearing the Word of God.

1:04:39.876 --> 1:04:42.443
- Yeah, I guess
I'll try it, again.

1:04:44.576 --> 1:04:45.359
Where do I start?

1:04:47.187 --> 1:04:49.320
- You start with Jesus' life.

1:04:49.407 --> 1:04:50.495
Read the book of Matthew

1:04:50.582 --> 1:04:52.584
and then read the book of Acts,

1:04:52.671 --> 1:04:54.760
the first couple of chapters.

1:04:54.847 --> 1:04:58.720
- Okay, I guess
I'll start tonight.

1:04:58.807 --> 1:05:01.158
- Great! [chuckles]

1:05:01.245 --> 1:05:02.942
- I do have one problem though.

1:05:03.029 --> 1:05:03.987
- What?

1:05:04.074 --> 1:05:05.075
- I don't have a Bible. [laughs]

1:05:05.162 --> 1:05:06.946
- Uh, that's not a problem.

1:05:07.033 --> 1:05:10.384
Did I mention my mom
runs a bookstore?

1:05:10.471 --> 1:05:13.170
[both laughing]

1:05:13.257 --> 1:05:16.913
- Okay, anyways, let's
just try this again.

my life and my soul ♪

1:05:28.837 --> 1:05:33.886
♪ I gave you my heart,
my mind and control ♪

- Chloe, you've been
reading for weeks.

1:05:37.194 --> 1:05:38.325
What's going on?

1:05:38.412 --> 1:05:39.805
- I don't know.

1:05:39.892 --> 1:05:41.285
I mean, at first, I thought
it was pretty boring

1:05:41.372 --> 1:05:44.941
and dry, and, I don't
know, now I just...

1:05:46.986 --> 1:05:47.987
- Now you have questions?

1:05:50.903 --> 1:05:55.647
- Why do we have
so many different
churches, and one Bible?

1:05:56.909 --> 1:05:59.738
And why is it that we have
so many different religions

1:05:59.825 --> 1:06:01.958
but just one book?

1:06:02.045 --> 1:06:04.177
Isn't it
straightforward, or what?

1:06:04.264 --> 1:06:06.092
- Well, it's kind
of like what my Dad

1:06:06.179 --> 1:06:07.702
always used to tell me.

1:06:07.789 --> 1:06:10.270
People don't argue over what
the Bible actually says,

1:06:10.357 --> 1:06:13.317
they argue over what they
think it says. [chuckles]

1:06:13.404 --> 1:06:15.101
Most people don't read
the Bible for themselves,

1:06:15.188 --> 1:06:16.798
most just go to church

1:06:16.885 --> 1:06:18.757
and wait for their Pastor to
tell them what the Bible says.

1:06:18.844 --> 1:06:21.890
You know what, read 2 Timothy
2:15, while your at it.

1:06:23.196 --> 1:06:27.548

rightly dividing

1:06:42.259 --> 1:06:44.087

- Only your graciousness
outshines your
subtleness, Caleb.

1:27:31.157 --> 1:27:33.596
- Listen guys, I know it
feels like I ditched you

1:27:33.683 --> 1:27:34.597
for my old friends,

1:27:34.684 --> 1:27:35.902
but that's not what happened.

1:27:37.164 --> 1:27:38.601
I'm sorry I did though,

1:27:38.688 --> 1:27:41.081
and I'll make it up
to you guys next time.

1:27:41.168 --> 1:27:43.954
- We know, because we
made it into the finals!

1:27:44.041 --> 1:27:44.955
- [Many] What?

1:27:45.041 --> 1:27:46.652
- Wait, how do you know?

1:27:46.739 --> 1:27:48.263
- I thought they weren't
posting the results until 10:00?

1:27:48.350 --> 1:27:50.830
- Well, I swung by the office
to drop off some paperwork

1:27:50.916 --> 1:27:53.224
and I heard the
Dean on the phone.

1:27:53.311 --> 1:27:54.746
- This calls for a celebration!

1:27:54.834 --> 1:27:56.227

chickens before they hatch.

1:27:57.141 --> 1:27:58.447
- What?

1:27:58.534 --> 1:28:00.231
- Caleb, [giggles]
it surprises me

1:28:00.318 --> 1:28:02.277
you make the grades you do.

1:28:02.364 --> 1:28:04.540
- I was just thinking a
little pie to celebrate

1:28:04.627 --> 1:28:06.977
this great occasion
would be appropriate.

1:28:07.064 --> 1:28:09.109
Although, chicken
sounds pretty good too!

1:28:10.850 --> 1:28:14.941
- Can I talk to you guys in
the other room for a minute.

1:28:15.028 --> 1:28:17.379
[Chloe sighs]

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:22.166
I don't think I should be in
this competition with you guys.

1:28:22.253 --> 1:28:22.732
- Why not?

1:28:22.818 --> 1:28:24.473
- Why?

1:28:24.559 --> 1:28:28.520
- I don't think I deserve it,
especially after last night.

1:28:28.607 --> 1:28:32.785
- Listen Chloe, you did what
you did for the right reasons.

1:28:32.871 --> 1:28:34.004
You may have not made
the best decisions

1:28:34.091 --> 1:28:35.005
while you were there,

1:28:35.092 --> 1:28:36.963
but I understand why you went.

1:28:37.050 --> 1:28:39.791
- Joshua is right, you
can't let the decisions

1:28:39.879 --> 1:28:41.446
of your past allow
you to not make

1:28:41.532 --> 1:28:43.143
good decisions in your future.

1:28:43.230 --> 1:28:45.885
We want you and we need you
so you're coming with us.

1:28:47.583 --> 1:28:50.237

have friends like you guys.

You both need your rest.

1:31:10.682 --> 1:31:12.031

- Really Chloe, please
make sure she gets rest

1:31:13.684 --> 1:31:15.992
this weekend, sometimes
she just doesn't know

1:31:16.079 --> 1:31:17.341
why she has limits.

- [laughs] I don't
think she knows

like the meaning of that word.

1:31:23.173 --> 1:31:27.394

something about Nechelle.

[car tires screeching]
[car thuds]

1:31:34.445 --> 1:31:35.838
Chloe, call 911.

1:31:39.318 --> 1:31:40.407
- Hello.

1:31:40.495 --> 1:31:43.062

1:31:50.766 --> 1:31:53.420
[Chloe crying]

1:32:02.429 --> 1:32:05.868
- Nechelle was really
sick for a long time.

1:32:07.565 --> 1:32:11.221
The doctors only gave her
six months, five years ago.

1:32:13.092 --> 1:32:16.356
But, Nechelle and God,
they had another plan.

1:32:17.923 --> 1:32:19.403
I remember Nechelle would pray

1:32:19.490 --> 1:32:21.405
that before she left this earth,

1:32:22.449 --> 1:32:24.669
that she could teach someone,

1:32:24.755 --> 1:32:27.411
that she could bring
someone to Christ.

1:32:28.630 --> 1:32:32.068
You, Chloe are the
answer to her prayer.

1:32:32.155 --> 1:32:36.115
She prayed for you for five
years before you two even met.

1:32:37.813 --> 1:32:41.251
Can you see, from her
perspective, how this is a joy?

1:32:41.338 --> 1:32:43.818
[Chloe crying]

1:32:55.657 --> 1:32:57.572
- From dust we where made

1:32:58.746 --> 1:33:01.663
and to dust we will return.

1:33:03.316 --> 1:33:06.798
That's really what happens
in the simplest of terms,

1:33:07.930 --> 1:33:09.627
but it doesn't tell
the whole story.

1:33:11.281 --> 1:33:12.587
What happens to our spirit?

1:33:13.500 --> 1:33:15.371
What happens next?

1:33:15.459 --> 1:33:19.550
What happens to that
internal part of who we are?

1:33:19.637 --> 1:33:24.380
Nechelle, I tell you what,
believed with her whole heart,

1:33:24.468 --> 1:33:26.469
that it's not the end,

1:33:26.557 --> 1:33:29.865
but rather, it's
a new beginning.

1:33:29.952 --> 1:33:32.215
- Nechelle was the
sister I never had.

1:33:32.302 --> 1:33:34.521
She was so full of life and joy.

1:33:34.609 --> 1:33:37.960
And she had a way of spreading
that joy to everyone she met.

1:33:38.047 --> 1:33:40.223
Even Old man Crabs would
smile when she walked by.

1:33:40.309 --> 1:33:41.746
[many laughing]

1:33:41.833 --> 1:33:43.443
She was a light that
could not be hidden.

1:33:45.054 --> 1:33:47.056
- She made you feel
as though everything

1:33:47.143 --> 1:33:48.448
was gonna be alright.

1:33:49.624 --> 1:33:51.147
They say faith can
move mountains,

1:33:51.234 --> 1:33:54.237
I saw faith in Nechelle like
those written in the Bible.

1:33:55.151 --> 1:33:57.066
She judged no one.

1:33:57.153 --> 1:33:59.764
But, what most of
you don't know is,

1:33:59.851 --> 1:34:01.723
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Nechelle.

1:34:03.246 --> 1:34:04.639
She saved me from myself.

1:34:11.950 --> 1:34:13.865
- Um, I brought some papers

1:34:13.952 --> 1:34:17.216
just so I wouldn't totally
loose my train of thought.

1:34:17.303 --> 1:34:18.217
Um [clears throat],

1:34:22.700 --> 1:34:25.877
when Momma Cooper first
asked me to speak,

1:34:25.964 --> 1:34:30.795
Um, I was speechless,
and upset, and confused.

1:34:37.584 --> 1:34:40.457
And then I thought about what
Nechelle would have said,

1:34:40.544 --> 1:34:42.241
would have wanted me to do.

1:34:42.327 --> 1:34:47.202
And so, I prayed and "gave it
to God" like she always said.

1:34:49.771 --> 1:34:53.731
Um, [sighs] I know that she
wouldn't want us to be sad,

1:35:00.999 --> 1:35:04.437
but be thankful for the
time that we had together.

1:35:08.659 --> 1:35:12.184
And that these tears would
not be tears of sadness,

1:35:12.271 --> 1:35:15.318
but of joy for
knowing each other.

1:35:15.405 --> 1:35:17.929

1:39:52.290 --> 1:39:54.771
- Sticks, thank you so
much for coming to help.

1:39:54.858 --> 1:39:55.772
I'm so happy that your here.

1:39:55.859 --> 1:39:57.295
It makes everything better.

1:39:57.382 --> 1:39:58.949
- Yeah, I knew you
guys needed the help.

1:39:59.036 --> 1:40:02.952
But, anyways, my parents want
me to check out the campus,

1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:04.650
because they might have told me

1:40:04.737 --> 1:40:06.782
that they would pay my
tuition if I went here.

1:40:06.870 --> 1:40:07.827
- What!

1:40:07.914 --> 1:40:09.177
- Yeah, don't get too excited.

1:40:09.264 --> 1:40:10.395
- Wait, hold on,
you wanna go here?

1:40:10.482 --> 1:40:11.962
You might come here? [laughs]

1:40:12.049 --> 1:40:14.356
- There's a chance,
but I didn't say yes.

1:40:14.443 --> 1:40:15.791
- Come on!

1:40:15.879 --> 1:40:16.749
Do you know how much
fun that would be?

1:40:16.835 --> 1:40:18.403
- We'll see, we'll see.

1:40:18.490 --> 1:40:19.969
I don't know yet, no promises.

1:40:21.798 --> 1:40:23.626
[books thud]

1:40:23.713 --> 1:40:25.236
- I'm gonna go help him.

1:40:25.323 --> 1:40:26.150
We're not done.

1:40:26.237 --> 1:40:27.151
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:40:27.237 --> 1:40:28.065
- [Chloe] Don't, don't leave.

1:40:28.152 --> 1:40:29.371
- Okay.

1:40:29.458 --> 1:40:30.546
- You okay?

1:40:30.633 --> 1:40:31.808
Here let me help you.

1:40:31.895 --> 1:40:33.114
[books thud]

1:40:33.201 --> 1:40:34.853
[Chloe laughs]

1:40:34.941 --> 1:40:35.986
What's your name?

1:40:36.073 --> 1:40:37.031
- [laughs] Edward.

1:40:37.118 --> 1:40:38.467
- Edward, it's nice to meet you.

1:40:38.554 --> 1:40:39.859
Let's go check these out.

1:40:41.992 --> 1:40:45.865
Momma Cooper, this is Edward,
Edward this is momma Coop.

1:40:45.952 --> 1:40:47.389
- Welcome to CCU, Edward.

1:40:47.476 --> 1:40:49.260
- Aw, thanks.

1:40:49.347 --> 1:40:54.178
- So five history books
and three math, right?

1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:55.049
- [Edward] Yeah.

1:40:56.093 --> 1:40:57.964
- Your really smart, huh?

1:40:58.052 --> 1:40:58.791
- A little.

1:41:00.445 --> 1:41:03.448
- Okay, Edward, your
total is $276.42

1:41:03.535 --> 1:41:08.452
- Wow, okay, put $100 on this
card, put $75 on this one,

1:41:15.982 --> 1:41:17.723
- Okay.

1:41:17.809 --> 1:41:19.029
- Put $50 on this card

1:41:20.030 --> 1:41:21.901
and the rest on this one.

1:41:22.989 --> 1:41:25.557
[many laughing]

1:41:29.170 --> 1:41:30.258
- They are just jealous
about your hair.

1:41:30.344 --> 1:41:31.520
Don't worry about it.

1:41:31.607 --> 1:41:33.043
[both laughing]

1:41:33.130 --> 1:41:34.784
- Let me put these
in a bag for you.

1:41:34.871 --> 1:41:35.915
- So where are you staying?

1:41:36.002 --> 1:41:38.048
- Um, Bidwell Hall.

1:41:38.135 --> 1:41:39.049
- Okay, I'm gonna help
you carry your books,

1:41:39.136 --> 1:41:39.919
if you don't mind.

1:41:40.005 --> 1:41:40.833
- Thanks.

1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:41.834
- Here you go Edward.

1:41:41.921 --> 1:41:42.835
Thank you and welcome.

1:41:42.922 --> 1:41:44.620
Oh, oh, oh, you'll need these.

1:41:46.621 --> 1:41:48.189
- Can I help you
guys with something?

1:41:48.276 --> 1:41:49.842
Are you shopping
or are you going?

1:41:49.929 --> 1:41:51.496
- Don't worry.

1:41:51.583 --> 1:41:53.237
I think these boys can take
the books by themselves.

1:41:53.324 --> 1:41:55.065
In fact, it may even
take them two trips.

1:41:55.152 --> 1:41:57.763
- By the way, this,
girls water bottle.

1:42:00.766 --> 1:42:01.680
- Step on up.

1:42:01.767 --> 1:42:02.986
Don't forget the water bottle.

1:42:05.641 --> 1:42:09.123
- Hey, wait, okay, you're
going to CCU now, right?

1:42:09.210 --> 1:42:10.689
- Yeah, I received
a full scholarship.

1:42:10.776 --> 1:42:11.603
- Are you serious?

1:42:11.690 --> 1:42:13.039
Wait, how old are you?

1:42:13.127 --> 1:42:14.693
- I'm almost 16, I
really wanted to go

1:42:14.780 --> 1:42:17.043
to like an engineering
school or something,

1:42:17.130 --> 1:42:19.133
but my parents
forced me to go here.

1:42:19.219 --> 1:42:20.830
- It's not that bad.

1:42:20.916 --> 1:42:22.745
I had to come here because it
was my grandma's dying wish,

1:42:22.832 --> 1:42:24.964
literally, her dying wish for
me to come to this school.

1:42:25.050 --> 1:42:26.183
- Her dying wish?

1:42:26.270 --> 1:42:28.968
- Yep, but you know what?

1:42:29.055 --> 1:42:31.057
My Grandma knew best,

1:42:31.145 --> 1:42:32.668
and your parents
probably do too.

1:42:33.930 --> 1:42:35.932
- I've never really fit in,

1:42:36.019 --> 1:42:38.500
because I've always been
younger than everyone else.

1:42:38.587 --> 1:42:41.633
So I guess, it doesn't
really matter where I go.

1:42:41.719 --> 1:42:43.374
- Well, I know how you feel.

1:42:43.460 --> 1:42:44.984
I mean, I never really fit in
when I first got here either.

1:42:45.071 --> 1:42:47.943
And I mean, not, about the
being young part, or anything,

1:42:48.031 --> 1:42:51.948
but, now, I know this is right
where God wanted me to be.

1:42:52.035 --> 1:42:54.168
- You seem to know
a lot about geeks.

1:42:54.255 --> 1:42:56.126
- [laughs] No, I just
know another cracked pot

1:42:56.213 --> 1:42:57.214
when I see one.

1:42:57.300 --> 1:42:58.737
- Cracked pot?

1:42:58.824 --> 1:42:59.564
- Uh, huh, have you
ever heard that story?

1:42:59.651 --> 1:43:01.130
- No.

1:43:01.218 --> 1:43:03.612
- Oh, one time there
was this water bearer

1:43:03.699 --> 1:43:05.179
and he had these two pots...
