00:22.625 --> 00:23.625
Hey.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.208
-Do you want a hand?
-Thank you.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.416
-Someone knows something.
-Who?

00:31.666 --> 00:33.750
They were at my house.
They trashed my clinic.

00:34.708 --> 00:38.208
If the same people killed Hans,
they may know everything.

00:38.833 --> 00:40.458
Who killed Hans?

00:42.250 --> 00:46.250
Lykke, you know there are people
here on Earth opposing all of this.

00:46.833 --> 00:48.333
It could be any one of them.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.125
Emma's been there too.

00:51.625 --> 00:52.833
But she's there all the time.

00:52.916 --> 00:55.291
-She knows something.
-She knows nothing.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.333
She was out by the farm. Emma, I mean.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.750
And she wasn't alone.

01:01.125 --> 01:04.541
But she's blind,
and it's our job to make her see.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.375
-We need to do it now.
-No.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.208
-I'm not ready.
-That's the way it is.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.791
You've always been there.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.833
You've covered for us.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.583
We're eternally grateful to you…

01:21.875 --> 01:24.291
-She doesn't need to know anything.
-She'll expose us.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.625
-We have to tell her.
-And if we don't?

01:27.583 --> 01:29.458
You can't change what's about to happen.

01:32.916 --> 01:34.583
Let me speak to her first.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.208
You have to do it now.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.500
I have to go to work.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.041
Elvis.

02:12.833 --> 02:13.958
What do you want?

02:15.125 --> 02:16.625
What do you know about my mom?

02:17.875 --> 02:19.791
So, everything is still all about you?

02:19.875 --> 02:21.375
No, it's about her.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.500
-Was she on your list?
-Half of Middelbo is on that list.

02:24.583 --> 02:25.833
She's one of them.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.541
I have to figure out what to do.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.250
Sure. And I need the movers to finish.

02:38.416 --> 02:40.750
-I need you.
-But we're not in this together.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.458
I don't know what you're on
or what you think you know,

02:44.541 --> 02:46.958
but I don't want to help.
I don't have the energy.

02:48.291 --> 02:49.541
I'm moving house.

03:14.666 --> 03:15.666
Mom?

03:24.541 --> 03:25.375
Hi.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.541
I've packed. We're going.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.625
Who are you?

03:30.875 --> 03:32.291
You're not my mom.

03:33.125 --> 03:33.958
No.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.041
Where is she?

03:42.875 --> 03:44.000
She died.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.291
-Did you kill her?
-No.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.958
They put you in my arms when she died

03:53.041 --> 03:55.708
and asked me to take care of you
as if you were my own.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.583
But who are you?

04:03.291 --> 04:04.166
Emma, stop.

04:04.250 --> 04:07.041
Nobody just hands a newborn to a stranger.

04:15.625 --> 04:16.625
He was right.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.000
You're manipulating us.

04:19.083 --> 04:21.083
-Who did you speak to?
-It doesn't matter.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.791
I know what you want.

04:25.875 --> 04:26.875
Emma.

04:28.583 --> 04:29.750
Emma.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.333
I just wanted
to look after you and protect you.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.916
-I wanted you to stay mine.
-You're lying.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.250
I can feel it.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.500
I feel stuff.

04:44.958 --> 04:46.666
I've always felt stuff.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.416
Yes.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.791
You feel stuff.

05:27.833 --> 05:28.833
Lukas.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.458
<i>-Yes?</i>
-Well…

05:46.333 --> 05:47.750
I can't find the hard drive.

05:48.541 --> 05:49.625
<i>I see.</i>

05:49.708 --> 05:52.833
But I think I know where Emma might be.

06:00.083 --> 06:04.875
There's this man she works with.
She's told him everything.

06:05.750 --> 06:06.791
<i>Okay.</i>

06:07.375 --> 06:09.875
And she says he's not from here.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.791
Search the building.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.666
And find him.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
Where is he?

07:32.500 --> 07:33.541
What are you doing here?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.625
Where is he from?

07:39.708 --> 07:40.916
<i>First floor, clear.</i>

07:41.000 --> 07:42.416
-Who?
-Lukas.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.541
That's his name, isn't it?

07:52.541 --> 07:54.125
<i>Second floor, clear.</i>

07:57.625 --> 07:58.708
Does he live here?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Who?

08:03.916 --> 08:05.541
<i>This is Beta. All clear.</i>

08:05.625 --> 08:07.125
You're coming with us.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.125
Continue.

09:12.916 --> 09:13.916
Get him!

09:31.875 --> 09:33.125
Lukas! Let her go!

10:38.583 --> 10:40.083
I'm protecting you.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.541
They'll come after you for this.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.458
Who?

11:27.541 --> 11:28.458
The police.

11:28.958 --> 11:29.958
Or…

11:31.333 --> 11:33.041
You can't just kill people.

11:34.208 --> 11:37.791
If we don't stop the organism,
even more will get killed.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.375
-Because they'll invade us, or what?
-Yes.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.875
-How?
-They get inside your heads.

11:44.833 --> 11:47.916
-They force you to think like them.
-Why didn't they do so from the start?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.833
They needed to get to know you.
Every last detail about you.

11:51.458 --> 11:53.291
They've waited for the right time.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.041
The creatures… They are evil.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.000
They want to destroy you.

12:25.708 --> 12:27.208
What'll you do with them?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.416
Hold them accountable.

12:33.416 --> 12:34.250
How?

12:36.083 --> 12:37.958
-That's not up to me.
-Then who?

12:38.666 --> 12:40.750
Who decides what's right and wrong?

12:40.833 --> 12:42.833
It's not up for discussion.
It's just the way it is.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.041
It must be easy to believe
that something is so simple.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.875
-It is what it is.
-No.

12:52.458 --> 12:53.666
It really isn't.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.083
What are you hiding?

13:12.375 --> 13:13.708
Who did you talk to?

13:14.291 --> 13:15.291
Nobody.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.583
Emma, I need to know where they are.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.916
I just need one
in order to find the others.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.375
It's someone you love.

14:03.583 --> 14:04.916
Please don't hurt her.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.083
Emma? Where are you?

14:19.666 --> 14:20.666
<i>Come home, please.</i>

14:22.583 --> 14:23.583
<i>Emma?</i>

14:25.666 --> 14:26.791
Do you love me?

14:27.916 --> 14:29.666
<i>Of course I love you.</i>

14:30.291 --> 14:31.625
You're my daughter.

14:33.541 --> 14:34.708
<i>But I'm not.</i>

14:35.791 --> 14:37.041
Yes, you are.

14:40.958 --> 14:43.333
-Who are the others?
-<i>I couldn't tell you.</i>

14:43.416 --> 14:46.041
<i>-I wasn't allowed to.</i>
<i>-</i>Explain to me what's happening.

14:46.125 --> 14:48.833
I can't do that over the phone.
Just come home.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.958
<i>I don't know if I can trust you.</i>

14:52.041 --> 14:55.833
You can trust me.
I'll explain everything. Come home.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.250
I…

14:57.333 --> 14:59.041
<i>I can tell you everything.</i>

15:02.541 --> 15:04.166
<i>Mama Thai in an hour.</i>

15:10.458 --> 15:12.375
Arranging to meet in a crowded place.

15:13.375 --> 15:14.375
Good thinking.

15:16.125 --> 15:19.833
You need to ascertain
how many there are and where they are.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.125
That's all.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.666
I'll do the rest.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.750
Sure.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.250
She'll lie to you.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.166
Manipulate you.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.750
She can read your mind.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.125
Use your thoughts against you.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.125
But she's my mom.

15:40.416 --> 15:42.000
You need to remember that.

16:00.666 --> 16:01.708
Frede speaking.

16:04.541 --> 16:05.541
Emma?

16:06.458 --> 16:08.083
-And you're okay?
-Yes.

16:15.791 --> 16:17.291
Who did all this?

16:19.916 --> 16:20.916
The man.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.291
Which man?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.500
The man Emma met with.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.208
How?

16:30.916 --> 16:32.708
It all happened so fucking fast.

16:35.708 --> 16:37.291
I don't want to do this anymore.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.125
You've passed the point of no return.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.166
Pull yourself together.

16:42.666 --> 16:44.166
Do as you're told.

16:47.333 --> 16:48.458
Why me?

16:49.458 --> 16:51.125
Because you were given a mission.

16:52.291 --> 16:53.500
Find Emma.

17:19.666 --> 17:22.500
No, I don't know where she is.
I haven't seen her.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.541
Track her phone.
Isn't that something you know how to do?

17:29.041 --> 17:30.750
She may have disconnected it.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.250
I'll let you know if I see her.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.041
Sure. Bye.

17:43.125 --> 17:44.708
Mads is looking for you.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.208
Okay.

17:46.291 --> 17:47.750
He sounded pretty stressed.

17:48.416 --> 17:50.375
-Did you tell him anything?
-No.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.500
It's pretty nuts, huh?

17:56.625 --> 17:57.791
Not a peep from you,

17:58.500 --> 18:01.000
then you call out of the blue,
asking me to come get you.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.375
I didn't know who else to call.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.166
Mama Thai?

18:15.250 --> 18:16.250
Yeah.

18:18.583 --> 18:19.583
Hop on.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.250
Sorry.

18:35.750 --> 18:36.916
What?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.125
Sorry!

18:38.208 --> 18:39.208
What for?

18:40.083 --> 18:41.291
I don't know.

18:43.958 --> 18:45.166
Cool.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.458
Sorry, I'm a fucking idiot.

18:52.375 --> 18:53.916
I hadn't noticed.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.250
<i>You need to talk to Marie.</i>

19:09.333 --> 19:11.416
<i>-I can't.</i>
<i>-You have to.</i>

19:11.500 --> 19:13.208
There's nothing between us.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.458
It's all cool.

19:16.750 --> 19:17.750
But Marie…

19:19.083 --> 19:20.625
The way she looks at you.

19:21.916 --> 19:23.958
The way you look at her.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.500
It was all a bit easier without you.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.041
Your phone.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.375
Be careful.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.375
Hey.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.291
-I found her.
-Where?

20:56.708 --> 20:58.625
-Right around here.
-I don't know where she is.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.208
I understand.
That's fine. Just let him go.

21:11.541 --> 21:12.875
She's smarter than you.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.166
She was just lucky.

21:25.416 --> 21:27.208
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

21:35.916 --> 21:36.916
Emma.

21:37.916 --> 21:38.916
Stay.

21:39.458 --> 21:40.625
I'm not going to hurt you.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.333
Where's my mom?

21:52.166 --> 21:53.708
She's waiting for you at home.

21:55.250 --> 21:58.041
-I don't believe you.
-She knew you wouldn't.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.291
She says she's using a "Mom veto."

22:14.500 --> 22:17.000
I knew your biological mother.

22:18.583 --> 22:19.500
What?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.708
I was there when you were born.

22:25.708 --> 22:27.791
-How?
-I'd like to show you.

22:28.708 --> 22:30.875
No, what are you doing? Who are you?

22:39.666 --> 22:40.833
Hello?

22:43.708 --> 22:44.791
Hello?

23:03.208 --> 23:05.208
We arrived 17 years ago.

23:07.041 --> 23:09.000
-The meteor, you mean?
-The spaceship.

23:09.083 --> 23:12.208
Isn't that what you call it? A spaceship?

23:14.458 --> 23:17.875
We left our homes. We left our planet.

23:18.458 --> 23:21.708
We fled from those who wanted to kill us.

23:33.625 --> 23:35.083
We traveled through time and space

23:35.166 --> 23:38.083
to find a place
where the inhabitants looked like us.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.208
Our plan was to stay there
until we could go back home.

23:42.166 --> 23:45.875
We looked for a deserted place to land,
where nobody would see us.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.708
But it didn't go as planned.

23:48.791 --> 23:50.375
We didn't land.

23:50.458 --> 23:51.666
We crash-landed.

24:22.291 --> 24:23.791
<i>Your biological mother…</i>

24:26.541 --> 24:27.750
<i>She didn't make it.</i>

24:33.208 --> 24:34.208
Hi.

24:34.750 --> 24:35.750
Hi, sweetie.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.166
<i>Lykke…</i>

24:39.750 --> 24:41.083
<i>She was there.</i>

24:42.333 --> 24:45.375
<i>A human, who was close</i>
<i>to where we crash-landed.</i>

24:46.208 --> 24:47.208
Hey, you.

24:49.458 --> 24:51.625
Sweet baby.

24:53.500 --> 24:57.291
<i>If she hadn't been there,</i>
<i>you wouldn't have made it.</i>

25:00.833 --> 25:03.166
<i>-Hans was one of the survivors.</i>
-There now.

25:03.666 --> 25:05.708
<i>He brought you to Lykke.</i>

25:11.458 --> 25:13.666
If a life means anything to you,

25:14.750 --> 25:16.375
you have to make her yours.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.541
That's what I said to her.

25:22.833 --> 25:23.833
To Lykke.

25:27.666 --> 25:31.916
She gave up her identity…
everything, for you.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.750
But that means I'm…

25:48.125 --> 25:49.791
You're one of us.

25:55.333 --> 25:59.000
-But your blood is--
-Do you still take your medication?

26:01.291 --> 26:04.041
Did you never consider
what the pills were for?

26:12.291 --> 26:13.291
Have a look.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
I don't want to.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.458
Don't be afraid of what you are.

26:26.625 --> 26:31.291
You're the only one on this planet
who can do the things you do.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.833
Nobody has the sensibilities you have.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.125
You don't belong here.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.166
And you know it.

26:44.541 --> 26:46.125
You belong somewhere else.

26:48.750 --> 26:52.291
When you've accepted yourself,
I'll show you what you're capable of.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.750
Do you accept who you are?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.041
Can you feel what I just told you?

28:08.583 --> 28:09.583
Can you feel it?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.291
Yes.

28:18.416 --> 28:19.625
Come with me.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.458
What is this place?

28:50.833 --> 28:52.250
That's not important right now.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.708
-What's important, then?
-That we're going home.

28:58.041 --> 29:00.541
It was always the plan,
ever since we arrived.

29:02.250 --> 29:04.958
To go back when the war is over.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.458
The signal?

29:11.541 --> 29:13.125
Yes. The signal.

29:14.416 --> 29:18.500
The signal that showed us
that the war is over.

29:19.916 --> 29:21.416
We know we're going home.

29:22.541 --> 29:23.958
We just don't know when.

29:24.041 --> 29:25.708
But it'll be soon.

29:25.791 --> 29:30.166
Finally, you can say goodbye to the world
where you never felt at home.

29:34.166 --> 29:35.166
But how?

29:37.083 --> 29:38.750
The war's not over.

29:42.791 --> 29:43.625
What do you mean?

29:43.708 --> 29:46.791
Lukas said you came here to conquer Earth.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.000
Lukas?

29:49.875 --> 29:50.708
Forget it.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.666
Stop it. Don't try to read my mind.

30:00.750 --> 30:01.916
Is he here?

30:03.916 --> 30:05.541
Is he here on Earth?

30:08.166 --> 30:09.166
Is he?

30:11.166 --> 30:12.000
Yes.

30:17.541 --> 30:18.375
Emma.

30:24.750 --> 30:27.750
If you don't come with me now,
he will kill you.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.250
We're meeting tomorrow morning.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.000
We're meeting here.

30:42.583 --> 30:44.083
We'll be waiting for you.

31:04.833 --> 31:07.083
The blood test results are in.

31:22.125 --> 31:23.125
No.

31:24.291 --> 31:25.791
I've seen her blood.

31:26.916 --> 31:27.916
It was red.

31:28.666 --> 31:29.708
Well, apparently not.

31:38.958 --> 31:41.625
You need to buckle up, my friend.
Buckle up.

31:50.958 --> 31:51.791
Emma?

31:52.500 --> 31:53.333
What's up?

31:54.416 --> 31:57.541
-Not now, Jonas.
-Do you want to have dinner with my folks?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.750
They're asking about you, so…

32:01.000 --> 32:02.458
I'm a bit busy.

32:03.333 --> 32:04.875
It's just a pork roast.

32:05.375 --> 32:09.416
With gravy, potatoes,
Mom's homemade pickled red cabbage.

32:10.375 --> 32:11.666
You'll really love it.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.250
It's nothing big.

32:19.708 --> 32:21.416
I'm a bit confused right now.

32:24.166 --> 32:25.791
I don't know who I really am.

32:28.708 --> 32:29.708
Just text me.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.625
See you at the ramp.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.708
I'm okay!

32:40.791 --> 32:41.791
Bye!

32:43.500 --> 32:44.500
Bye.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.083
Mom?

33:16.625 --> 33:17.625
Mom?

33:23.500 --> 33:24.500
Hi.

33:25.041 --> 33:26.375
Hey.

33:26.458 --> 33:27.958
You have to be careful.

33:28.458 --> 33:31.833
Mads and some others are after you.
They have weapons and…

33:31.916 --> 33:35.125
-Is it something to do with your mom?
-I can't explain it right now.

33:36.250 --> 33:37.250
Okay.

33:41.708 --> 33:42.625
I miss you.

33:47.083 --> 33:48.083
And…

33:49.833 --> 33:51.333
I just wish that…

33:53.291 --> 33:55.333
that you needed me too.

33:55.416 --> 33:56.291
Yeah.

33:56.375 --> 33:58.125
-But you don't.
-I do…

34:00.666 --> 34:02.166
Yes, I do.

34:23.916 --> 34:24.916
Em…

34:25.583 --> 34:26.541
Emma…

35:03.250 --> 35:04.083
Mom.

36:59.875 --> 37:01.166
Why did you lie to me?

37:07.666 --> 37:08.708
I can always feel it.

37:13.208 --> 37:14.625
What do you want?

37:39.458 --> 37:40.458
Who are you?

40:16.416 --> 40:17.416
Come on.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.333
Hurry up.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.458
There are others.

40:57.416 --> 40:58.458
Find them.

41:20.833 --> 41:21.833
Run.

41:26.333 --> 41:27.333
Run.

43:22.791 --> 43:26.416
