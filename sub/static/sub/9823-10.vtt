- Tommy, about the electricity.
- I know how it sounds but it's real.

00:06.689 --> 00:09.461
I'm picking up that driver.
And if he knows you, that's bad.

00:09.516 --> 00:11.221
The cops keeping it out of the papers.

00:11.448 --> 00:13.592
He wanted to put the cops onto Hector.

00:13.595 --> 00:16.385
- He forgot all about you.
- I haven't forgotten him.

00:16.455 --> 00:19.095
1216 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:19.295 --> 00:20.427
This was no mistake.

00:20.433 --> 00:21.619
He sabotaged me.

00:21.732 --> 00:24.290
Remember me? The answer is no.

00:24.466 --> 00:27.284
I know he was here. I know what he did.

Father Brady's in the chapel.

00:46.241 --> 00:49.911
Just push the call button
if you want to see him.

01:02.861 --> 01:04.650
When was the last time you ate?

01:05.441 --> 01:06.510
What?

01:06.511 --> 01:07.211
Food.

01:07.212 --> 01:08.850
Have you had any lately?

01:08.851 --> 01:10.821
I'm fine.

01:11.851 --> 01:13.965
Come on, Chuck, let's go over to Novi's

01:14.053 --> 01:17.991
and stretch our legs, get
some air, couple of hoagies.

01:18.007 --> 01:21.077
You want to get a sandwich? Now?

01:21.425 --> 01:23.295
Just a thought.

01:33.775 --> 01:38.544
Remember that time I accidentally invited

01:38.545 --> 01:42.945
Kathy and Cheryl to Mom's surprise party?

01:42.955 --> 01:46.215
It was, kind of, tricky
out on the dance floor.

01:46.721 --> 01:47.353
It was a fun night.

01:47.825 --> 01:52.124
I just remember the whole
family cleaning up after you.

01:52.125 --> 01:55.164
And Mom leaving her own birthday party

01:55.165 --> 01:57.665
to drive one of them home.

02:04.766 --> 02:06.299
Seriously, Chuck, we gotta eat.

02:06.857 --> 02:08.356
Mom'll be okay for a few minutes.

02:08.392 --> 02:10.592
It's been three days.
It could be three more.

02:10.627 --> 02:11.893
Okay?

02:11.928 --> 02:13.194
Let's go, buddy.

02:13.230 --> 02:16.364
Jimmy, you want to eat, go eat.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.832
I'll bring you something...

02:17.868 --> 02:22.771
um, roast beef, no tomato,
Italian on the side.

02:22.806 --> 02:23.938
All right?

02:23.974 --> 02:25.473
'Kay. Be right back.

03:12.689 --> 03:14.923
Mom?

03:14.958 --> 03:16.758
Mom?

03:20.197 --> 03:21.763
Jimmy.

03:21.798 --> 03:24.165
No, Mom, it's me... Chuck.

03:26.670 --> 03:29.270
Jimmy.

03:29.306 --> 03:31.139
No, Mom, it's m...

03:55.632 --> 03:57.699
So this is it, then?

03:57.734 --> 03:59.367
I'm sorry.

03:59.402 --> 04:01.903
She has that DNR.

04:03.173 --> 04:05.340
Is your brother in the building?

04:05.375 --> 04:06.608
We can use the intercom.

04:06.643 --> 04:08.309
No.

04:22.692 --> 04:26.961
Charles... is there anyone
you want us to call?

04:53.256 --> 04:55.089
H-Hey.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.257
Hey.

04:58.862 --> 04:59.828
Chuck.

04:59.863 --> 05:01.396
Hey, Chuck.

05:01.431 --> 05:04.165
Chuck, where's Mom? What happened?

05:04.201 --> 05:05.400
She's gone.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.670
What? W-When?

05:08.705 --> 05:11.673
How did...

05:20.483 --> 05:23.418
Did she wake up? Did she say anything?

05:28.291 --> 05:29.324
No.

06:12.570 --> 06:13.903
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

06:13.938 --> 06:14.904
- Hey!
- Come back tomorrow.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.372
It'll be half the price.

06:18.109 --> 06:19.208
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

06:19.244 --> 06:21.077
I got paper towels. Good.

06:21.112 --> 06:22.879
A guy came in, and now there's blood, uh...

06:24.249 --> 06:27.183
Um, yeah, hold on. Hold on one second.

06:27.218 --> 06:29.185
Chuck. Come on. Come on.

06:30.755 --> 06:32.388
Chuck. Hey, hey, hey.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.390
- Hey, Chuck, with us, buddy?
- The copy center.

06:34.425 --> 06:35.391
Chuck.

06:35.426 --> 06:36.793
615 Gold.

06:36.828 --> 06:38.194
Buddy, y-you okay?

06:38.229 --> 06:40.396
No, he doesn't look blue.

06:40.431 --> 06:42.064
Hey.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.467
- We're gonna get you to the hospital, okay?
- Lance.

06:44.502 --> 06:45.635
Everything will be all right.

06:45.670 --> 06:46.836
I work here.

06:57.282 --> 06:58.214
Hang tight, Charles.

06:58.249 --> 06:59.482
We're almost there.

07:03.688 --> 07:05.755
Watch yourself.

07:11.696 --> 07:12.862
Coming through.

07:17.202 --> 07:19.936
On 3. 1, 2, 3.

07:19.971 --> 07:21.304
Transferring.

07:22.874 --> 07:24.807
Okay.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.343
This is Charles McGill, late 50s.

07:27.378 --> 07:29.846
He had a syncopal episode at a print shop,

07:29.881 --> 07:31.914
witnessed by an employee.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.650
Estimated loss of consciousness
was one minute.

07:34.686 --> 07:36.519
His vitals are stable.

07:36.554 --> 07:38.354
He's got a laceration on his forehead

07:38.389 --> 07:40.957
that appears to need suturing.

07:40.992 --> 07:42.158
Charles, how you doing tonight?

07:42.193 --> 07:43.326
Can you talk to me?

07:43.361 --> 07:44.694
Seizure activity?

07:44.729 --> 07:46.596
Not in transfer and none reported.

07:46.631 --> 07:48.497
No urinary incontinence.

07:48.533 --> 07:50.099
Do we have any family members?

07:50.134 --> 07:51.701
- There's a brother in the waiting room.
- Okay.

07:51.736 --> 07:52.869
How much fluid did you give him?

07:52.904 --> 07:54.370
- Mnh.
- That's the first liter.

07:54.405 --> 07:56.138
- Lights.
- What's that, Charles?

07:56.174 --> 07:57.874
Mnh, you have to turn off the lights.

07:57.909 --> 08:00.476
- No, we can't do that right now, sweetie.
- Ohh! God.

08:00.511 --> 08:01.944
- You fell and hit your head.
- Mnh.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.112
We're gonna need to do some tests, okay?

08:03.147 --> 08:04.313
- No.
- We can't...

08:04.349 --> 08:06.084
- We need the lights on to help you.
- No.

08:06.142 --> 08:07.207
Charles, can you squeeze
my hand really hard?

08:08.086 --> 08:10.553
Turn the lights...

08:10.588 --> 08:12.288
Mnh. What is that?

08:12.323 --> 08:14.023
Okay, we're just checking
your oxygen there, Charles.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.157
- Ow!
- Do you have any allergies?

08:15.193 --> 08:16.292
No.

08:16.327 --> 08:17.393
Are you on any medications?

08:17.428 --> 08:19.128
Ohh, no. Mnh.

08:19.163 --> 08:20.963
Okay. I'm gonna move your arms and legs,

08:20.999 --> 08:22.565
- and you tell me if there's any pain, okay?
- Ow.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.567
- Can we get an EKG?
- What? To what?

08:24.602 --> 08:26.068
Gentlemen, did we get an EKG?

08:26.104 --> 08:27.904
- What?
- He's on a five-lead now.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.927
- Okay. We didn't get a 12-lead.
- No.

08:29.962 --> 08:30.995
Okay, Tricia, we're gonna
need a 12-lead, please.

08:31.042 --> 08:33.643
No EKG! No EKG!

08:33.678 --> 08:35.211
Yes, Charles, we need to do o EKG okay?

08:35.246 --> 08:36.645
- No, you don't understand.
- Charles.

08:36.681 --> 08:38.014
- I have a condition!
- Charles, we need...

08:38.049 --> 08:40.482
I have a hypersensitivity to electricity!

08:40.518 --> 08:41.434
Okay, but you need to lie still...

08:41.436 --> 08:42.351
Charles, please push your
feet against my hands.

08:42.386 --> 08:44.420
- so we examine your head and your neck...
- Very good.

08:44.455 --> 08:46.155
- make sure your heart's all right, okay?
- Get these out of here.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.157
- No, you can't touch this.
- No, I... I have a condition.

08:48.192 --> 08:49.892
- Tricia, can I get a light?
- I did not give you my consent.

08:49.928 --> 08:51.861
- You can't touch that.
- You have no right to do this!

08:51.896 --> 08:54.530
- We need to monitor your heart, okay?
- Get these out of here!

08:54.565 --> 08:56.065
- Charles.
- Just relax.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.366
- The lights, please.
- Just relax.

08:57.402 --> 08:58.668
Please stay calm, Charles.

08:58.703 --> 09:00.002
Ohhh!

09:00.038 --> 09:01.370
Charles, you need to cooperate with us.

09:01.406 --> 09:02.705
This is gonna be very easy.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.707
We're just gonna draw a little bit of blood,

09:04.742 --> 09:06.776
suture up your wound,
and do a very simple CAT scan.

09:06.811 --> 09:08.511
- No! No CAT scan!
- Okay, c-calm, calm.

09:08.546 --> 09:09.630
No CAT scan!

09:09.631 --> 09:10.713
Tricia, can we please get some restraints?

09:10.748 --> 09:12.715
- You don't understand!
- Gentlemen, please come in here.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.183
- Please, turn off the lights.
- You have to hold him down, restrain him.

09:14.218 --> 09:15.584
- Please turn off the lights!
- Charles...

09:15.620 --> 09:16.953
- Right here...
- We need you to calm down.

09:16.988 --> 09:18.754
- You're killing me!
- Calm down, Charles.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.756
Just gonna get them
and figure it out for you.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.525
We got you.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.893
Just keep your head down.

09:45.783 --> 09:47.450
How's he doing?

09:47.485 --> 09:48.918
I'd love to be able to tell you,

09:48.953 --> 09:51.487
but we can't know for sure
until we do those tests.

09:54.492 --> 09:55.791
You know what I'm gonna say.

09:55.827 --> 09:57.059
Why can't you just go old-school...

09:57.095 --> 09:58.327
you know, look at his pupils,

09:58.363 --> 09:59.929
use a stethoscope... that kinda thing?

09:59.964 --> 10:01.097
He doesn't want to be here.

10:01.132 --> 10:02.765
What he wants and what he needs

10:02.800 --> 10:05.301
are two very different things, Jimmy.

10:05.336 --> 10:07.236
We don't know if he lost consciousness

10:07.271 --> 10:10.973
because of a heart-related issue
or if it was a mild stroke.

10:11.009 --> 10:13.309
We don't know if his spine has been injured

10:13.344 --> 10:14.643
if his brain is swelling.

10:14.679 --> 10:16.679
He likely has a concussion, at least.

10:16.714 --> 10:19.081
Chuck is once again refusing these tests

10:19.117 --> 10:22.351
because they involve being
bombarded by electricity...

10:22.387 --> 10:24.687
his words.

10:24.722 --> 10:27.356
Nothing has changed since
the last time he was in here.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.826
Look, I don't know how to
explain this any clearer.

10:30.862 --> 10:32.862
I'm not committing him.

10:37.635 --> 10:41.437
What about a Temporary
Emergency Guardianship?

10:41.472 --> 10:43.606
I mean, he fits the parameters.

10:43.641 --> 10:44.874
You're telling me

10:44.909 --> 10:46.509
he's in need of medical care so urgent

10:46.544 --> 10:48.711
that we can't wait around
on court procedure.

10:48.746 --> 10:49.845
- Most certainly.
- Yeah.

10:49.881 --> 10:52.548
And Chuck is not able to
understand the consequences.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.517
I mean, he can understand them, but he...

10:54.552 --> 10:55.651
Absolutely.

10:55.686 --> 10:57.053
A judge will see it that way, too.

10:57.088 --> 10:59.188
And then I take him home, and it's over.

10:59.223 --> 11:02.725
Pending results and proper treatment, yes.

11:04.062 --> 11:07.063
I know a judge we can call right now.

11:12.203 --> 11:14.270
Let me be the one to tell him.

11:36.761 --> 11:39.428
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

11:41.432 --> 11:43.365
Chuck.

11:43.401 --> 11:46.769
Well, if it isn't Johnny-on-the-spot.

11:46.804 --> 11:48.537
What? What does that mean?

11:48.573 --> 11:50.606
Is Ernesto out there?

11:50.641 --> 11:52.408
Yeah. Can I get you something?

11:52.443 --> 11:53.742
Ernesto!

11:53.778 --> 11:54.710
Come in here, please!

11:54.745 --> 11:56.045
Look, just take it easy.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.681
Ernesto!

12:00.751 --> 12:02.384
Just put your stuff in there.

12:06.724 --> 12:09.058
I got him.

12:09.093 --> 12:10.526
How are you feeling', Mr. McGill?

12:10.561 --> 12:12.561
Ernesto, how long was I unconscious

12:12.597 --> 12:13.696
in that print shop?

12:13.731 --> 12:14.964
I'm not sure.

12:14.999 --> 12:17.399
30 seconds, a minute?

12:17.435 --> 12:19.368
- 2 minutes?
- I'd say maybe about a minute.

12:19.403 --> 12:20.536
You were kinda in and out.

12:20.571 --> 12:22.138
And how long was I lying on the floor

12:22.173 --> 12:23.939
before the ambulance arrived?

12:23.975 --> 12:26.942
About 10 minutes, I think,
t I didn't look at the clock.

12:26.978 --> 12:30.813
And yet, you were there.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.215
Chuck, can we, uh...

12:33.251 --> 12:34.817
There's only one way

12:34.852 --> 12:36.919
you could have gotten there so quickly...

12:36.954 --> 12:38.254
you never left.

12:38.289 --> 12:40.322
I think you're getting all wound up.

12:40.358 --> 12:41.891
Can you just take a few deep br...

12:41.926 --> 12:43.292
You bribed him...

12:43.327 --> 12:44.326
that kid behind the counter.

12:44.362 --> 12:45.761
What?

12:45.796 --> 12:47.997
Between the time Ernesto left and I arrived,

12:48.032 --> 12:49.665
you paid that half-wit to swear

12:49.700 --> 12:51.100
- he'd never laid eyes on you.
- Mr. McGill.

12:51.135 --> 12:53.636
And then you stuck around to watch.

12:53.671 --> 12:55.938
Why? Just wanted to see me suffer?

12:55.973 --> 12:57.406
- Hmm?
- Mr. McGill.

12:57.441 --> 12:58.574
Just wanted to have a laugh at my expense?

12:58.609 --> 13:00.109
I called him.

13:02.013 --> 13:03.412
What?

13:03.447 --> 13:05.581
I called Jimmy earlier,
before I picked you up.

13:05.616 --> 13:08.584
He showed up when he did
because I called him.

13:08.619 --> 13:11.420
I was worried about you, and I just...

13:11.455 --> 13:12.922
I called him.

13:12.957 --> 13:14.456
I'm sorry.

13:18.663 --> 13:22.531
Get out... Both of you.

13:35.913 --> 13:38.480
Chuck, there's something that I have to do,

13:38.516 --> 13:41.116
and I'm really sorry...

13:41.152 --> 13:42.484
Really, truly sorry,

13:42.520 --> 13:45.221
but I gotta do it, and it's for you.

13:45.256 --> 13:47.723
You're trying to have me committed.

13:47.758 --> 13:49.625
No, it's a Temporary...

13:49.660 --> 13:51.894
Temporary Emergency Guardianship...

13:51.929 --> 13:54.230
to-may-to, to-mah-to.

13:54.265 --> 13:57.766
Well, you've finally
got me where you want me.

14:16.621 --> 14:18.053
Hey, you look beat.

14:18.089 --> 14:20.422
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

14:20.458 --> 14:22.057
I'm fine to hang out, you know?

14:22.093 --> 14:23.058
Whatever you need.

14:23.094 --> 14:24.860
Nah. We're good here.

14:26.731 --> 14:28.197
Hey, Ernie.

14:28.232 --> 14:32.768
Uh, how come you said that about calling' me?

14:32.803 --> 14:34.203
I don't know, man.

14:34.238 --> 14:36.572
Look, I didn't want to say anything,

14:36.607 --> 14:38.107
but your brother...

14:38.142 --> 14:40.009
the way he's been
talking' about you lately...

14:40.044 --> 14:44.179
it's like... He's really
out to get you, Jimmy.

14:44.215 --> 14:47.249
And... I don't know.

14:47.285 --> 14:49.451
You're my friend.

14:51.589 --> 14:53.389
Thanks.

14:56.927 --> 14:59.061
I'll call you tomorrow.

15:00.564 --> 15:03.132
I miss the mailroom.

16:42.965 --> 16:45.365
Are you familiar with the Hippocratic oath?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.867
You should be.

16:46.902 --> 16:50.170
One of the oldest
binding documents in history.

16:50.205 --> 16:53.173
Primum non nocere... First, do no harm.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.509
This is not the way to treat my condition.

16:55.544 --> 16:58.678
It's as though I had a...
an allergy to penicillin,

16:58.714 --> 17:01.848
and yet, you persist on treating
my infection with it.

17:01.884 --> 17:04.151
I appreciate the analogy, Charles,

17:04.185 --> 17:07.053
but I don't think it quite fits.

17:07.089 --> 17:08.789
Look, we'll have you in and out of Radiology

17:08.824 --> 17:10.790
before you know it, all right?

17:10.826 --> 17:12.792
Then we can see about
getting that neck collar off

17:12.828 --> 17:13.827
and get you moving around.

17:24.373 --> 17:26.339
Okay, Charles, the scan is starting now.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.575
The table that you're on is going to move.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.911
You're gonna hear a sound
that might seem loud to you,

17:30.946 --> 17:33.513
but it's nothing to worry about.

18:21.505 --> 18:23.305
Still no word?

18:23.341 --> 18:24.306
Jesus.

18:24.342 --> 18:26.942
How long is this gonna take?

18:26.978 --> 18:29.945
She said that whole test
would be like 10 minutes.

18:29.981 --> 18:31.780
Maybe they had to start over.

18:31.816 --> 18:35.618
What... 20 times?

18:35.653 --> 18:37.586
He should be home.

18:37.622 --> 18:40.823
Jimmy, you're doing' the right thing.

18:45.363 --> 18:47.563
Would you get your work out, please?

18:47.598 --> 18:50.165
Because God knows how much
longer we're gonna be here.

18:50.201 --> 18:52.167
I'd feel better if you were doing something,

18:52.203 --> 18:54.603
you know, unhospital-y.

18:54.639 --> 18:57.006
Unhospital-y.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.874
I'm on it.

19:09.553 --> 19:11.520
You know what?

19:11.555 --> 19:14.757
- I'm gonna go ask for an update.
- Okay. Good idea.

19:14.792 --> 19:16.959
You are the greatest generation.

19:16.994 --> 19:18.260
- Jimmy.
- What?

19:18.296 --> 19:19.862
You didn't start World War II,

19:19.897 --> 19:22.031
but you sure as heck finished it.

19:22.066 --> 19:23.699
And if that weren't enough,

19:23.734 --> 19:27.503
you sent a rocket 300 feet tall to the moon.

19:27.538 --> 19:29.705
Now, in your golden years,

19:29.740 --> 19:32.207
you need someone looking out for you,

19:32.243 --> 19:33.642
someone you can trust,

19:33.678 --> 19:36.278
a man who says what he does

19:36.314 --> 19:38.113
and does what he says.

19:38.149 --> 19:40.950
When you need someone to count on...

19:40.985 --> 19:42.885
- Gimme Jimmy!
- Gimme Jimmy!

19:42.920 --> 19:44.520
Gimme Jimmy!

19:44.555 --> 19:48.991
Because moxie is in such
short supply these days.

19:49.026 --> 19:52.494
Jimmy McGill... A lawyer you can trust.

19:54.098 --> 19:56.065
It's really good, Jimmy.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.967
You made a really good commercial.

19:58.002 --> 19:59.601
Thanks.

20:09.914 --> 20:12.715
Jimmy.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.918
Oh, finally. So, how is he?

20:15.953 --> 20:18.921
Well, the good news is that,
physically, he's okay.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.357
The radiologist said everything looks normal

20:21.392 --> 20:23.092
with Charles' head and spine,

20:23.127 --> 20:24.927
so we took his neck collar off.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.562
His head wound will heal just fine.

20:26.597 --> 20:28.097
We gave him a tenus shot

20:28.132 --> 20:30.532
because his immunization records
were not current.

20:30.568 --> 20:31.734
I'm sure that's no surprise to you.

20:31.769 --> 20:32.935
And... And... And his heart?

20:32.970 --> 20:34.003
Strong.

20:34.038 --> 20:36.205
The EKG was normal.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.408
As far as losing consciousness,
my best guess is

20:39.443 --> 20:42.711
Charles had what's called
a stress-related syncope.

20:42.747 --> 20:44.913
It's basically a panic attack,

20:44.949 --> 20:49.351
but no signs of a stroke or cardiac event.

20:49.387 --> 20:52.554
However, there was...

20:52.590 --> 20:54.990
a complication.

20:57.595 --> 21:00.396
Chuck? Hey, buddy, it's me.

21:00.431 --> 21:02.798
They said everything looks good,
so let's get you outta here.

21:02.833 --> 21:04.933
What do you say?

21:13.010 --> 21:14.576
What's wrong with him?

21:14.612 --> 21:16.478
Whatever you gave him should've
worn off already, right?

21:16.514 --> 21:18.714
We watched him for several hours.

21:18.749 --> 21:21.083
We even gave him what's
called a reversal agent.

21:21.118 --> 21:24.086
So, yes, the sedative wore off.

21:24.121 --> 21:26.955
- This is something else.
- What?

21:26.991 --> 21:29.591
We think it's a state
of self-induced catatonia.

21:29.627 --> 21:31.460
"We"... always with the "we."

21:31.495 --> 21:32.661
I think it's you.

21:32.696 --> 21:34.763
You're the only doctor in the room.

21:34.799 --> 21:37.099
I think you fried his brain
with that machine.

21:37.134 --> 21:38.267
Jimmy.

21:38.302 --> 21:39.501
I'm sorry. This is bullshit.

21:39.537 --> 21:40.536
Jimmy.

21:41.705 --> 21:44.339
What next?

21:44.375 --> 21:47.609
When I first treated Charles,
he was in a similar state.

21:47.645 --> 21:48.944
Wouldn't you agree?

21:52.483 --> 21:55.150
I have to believe
that it's just a matter of time

21:55.186 --> 21:56.318
before he comes out of it.

21:56.353 --> 21:57.619
Matter of time.

21:57.655 --> 22:02.024
Fine, then. I'll wait right here.

22:12.036 --> 22:15.504
Shot left. 1.5 minutes.

22:18.642 --> 22:21.143
How many rounds've gone through the tube?

22:21.178 --> 22:22.978
For a 762?

22:23.013 --> 22:25.514
You can put 3,500 through it and never know.

22:25.549 --> 22:27.783
It's about how tight she shoots.

22:27.818 --> 22:30.352
And this one's tight as they come.

22:30.387 --> 22:34.690
I'd say there's a breeze
picking up downrange.

22:34.725 --> 22:36.525
Your barrel gonna be cold?

22:36.560 --> 22:39.661
Let's suppose so.

22:39.697 --> 22:41.697
Well, then, you'd better have
paid attention to that shot.

22:41.732 --> 22:44.733
Uh-huh. I'd better have.

22:44.768 --> 22:49.605
Adjusting right, 1.5 minutes.

22:56.413 --> 22:58.213
Send it.

23:01.085 --> 23:02.351
Hit.

23:02.386 --> 23:04.853
Center hit.

23:08.459 --> 23:10.826
I suggest you don't change up your ammo.

23:10.861 --> 23:13.562
Stick with the 168
grain boat-tail hollow point...

23:13.597 --> 23:15.998
if it's an open shot, that is.

23:16.033 --> 23:17.900
Now, if you got to shoot
through a heavy window,

23:17.935 --> 23:19.735
I'll up you to a 180.

23:19.770 --> 23:22.704
But as you know, you'll have
to recalculate the shot.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.440
168 will do it.

23:25.476 --> 23:28.277
How many boxes?

23:28.312 --> 23:29.945
Just the one.

23:32.283 --> 23:34.550
No, it's on the house.

23:38.455 --> 23:40.389
Uh, one last thing.

23:46.830 --> 23:47.996
No offense.

23:50.067 --> 23:52.401
None taken.

24:42.094 --> 24:43.193
Ohh.

24:45.163 --> 24:48.598
Jimmy, can I get some water?

24:48.634 --> 24:51.768
Chuck. Hey, buddy, you're back with us.

24:51.803 --> 24:52.969
How you...

24:53.005 --> 24:54.270
Can I get some water, please?

24:54.306 --> 24:55.505
Yeah, yeah, water.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.440
Mnh.

24:57.476 --> 24:59.643
Mnh.

25:04.850 --> 25:06.783
Oh, shit. Sorry.

25:08.220 --> 25:09.753
Want some more?

25:09.788 --> 25:11.121
Mm.

25:11.156 --> 25:12.455
Oh.

25:13.473 --> 25:14.438
Last thing I remember

25:14.474 --> 25:16.474
was that machine they put me in.

25:16.509 --> 25:17.775
How long was I out for?

25:20.146 --> 25:21.879
Was... 20 hours.

25:24.017 --> 25:27.618
And next order of business...
get you the hell outta here.

25:27.654 --> 25:30.154
Where to next?

25:30.190 --> 25:32.790
Some insane asylum in Las Cruces?

25:32.825 --> 25:36.160
Someplace you can really
tuck me away, but good?

25:36.196 --> 25:39.130
Home, Chuck. You're going' home.

25:39.165 --> 25:41.299
Well, your heart's okay,

25:41.334 --> 25:43.534
and so is that crack on your head,

25:43.570 --> 25:46.470
so that's all I wanted to know.

25:46.506 --> 25:49.574
What about the T.E.G.?

25:49.609 --> 25:52.677
The "T" stands for "Temporary," right?

25:55.882 --> 25:57.882
You wanna go to bed?

25:57.917 --> 26:00.851
No, no. It's... It's cooler down here.

26:05.725 --> 26:06.924
What can I get you?

26:08.361 --> 26:10.828
I'll make you some tea...
uh, the good stuff,

26:10.863 --> 26:12.697
not that brown water they have
at the hospital.

26:12.732 --> 26:15.333
I'm fine.

26:15.368 --> 26:16.734
I'll make you some tea.

26:16.769 --> 26:19.537
Jimmy. No.

26:20.773 --> 26:23.274
Just...

26:23.309 --> 26:25.076
You've done your duty.

26:25.111 --> 26:26.644
You can go now.

26:28.548 --> 26:31.582
That came out a bit harsh.

26:31.618 --> 26:35.219
Look, I've been zapped
and poked and prodded,

26:35.255 --> 26:40.291
and now I just I wanna be left alone.

26:40.326 --> 26:42.693
If things start going south for you again,

26:42.729 --> 26:43.894
how am I even gonna know?

26:43.930 --> 26:46.764
I'm fine. I promise.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.868
See?

26:50.903 --> 26:53.604
Feeling better already.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.307
I mean, I don't even have a key, so...

27:00.413 --> 27:01.746
Can I get Ernie back here?

27:01.781 --> 27:04.048
Would you let me do that for you, at least?

27:04.083 --> 27:05.950
You need someone looking' in on ya.

27:05.985 --> 27:07.118
You gotta eat, right?

27:08.921 --> 27:11.055
All right.

27:19.699 --> 27:21.866
Feel better, Chuck.

32:08.788 --> 32:10.220
Por favor!

36:05.324 --> 36:07.524
All right, I will get right on that.

36:07.567 --> 36:10.468
I should have it for you by early next week.

36:10.503 --> 36:14.371
You have yourself a
wonderful day, Mr. Collins.

36:19.879 --> 36:20.978
Oh! There you go.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.847
Yeah, get the sunglasses out.

36:22.882 --> 36:23.981
It's very bright.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.850
Gotta protect the old' peepers.

36:25.885 --> 36:28.652
You gotta...

36:28.688 --> 36:31.188
Yep, looking sharp.

36:31.224 --> 36:33.357
Bingo.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.559
Uh, bye-bye, now.

36:38.364 --> 36:39.830
Okay.

36:39.866 --> 36:43.167
Folks, I'm sorry about the wait,

36:43.202 --> 36:45.503
but the attention I give each client means

36:45.538 --> 36:49.173
sometimes, things get a little... backed up.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.875
Uh [breathes sharply] but I promise

36:50.910 --> 36:52.943
to get to each and every one of you in turn.

36:52.979 --> 36:55.045
Mrs. DeShazo, my dear,
I believe you're next.

36:55.081 --> 36:57.014
But first, may I get anybody some coffee?

36:57.049 --> 36:58.849
Can I talk to you?

36:58.885 --> 37:01.585
Uh, excuse me one second.

37:01.621 --> 37:04.722
We have got to get a
receptionist... like, yesterday.

37:04.757 --> 37:06.090
Jimmy, Howard just called.

37:06.159 --> 37:08.860
He says he has been trying
to reach you all morning.

37:08.896 --> 37:12.030
So? Tell him to stop bothering
you and leave me a message.

37:12.065 --> 37:14.099
It's about Chuck.

37:14.134 --> 37:16.334
It's important... That's all he'll say.

37:17.905 --> 37:19.471
Okay.

37:19.506 --> 37:22.807
Unfortunately, uh, my associate tells me

37:22.843 --> 37:26.111
I'm needed for some brief
but pressing legal business.

37:26.146 --> 37:28.947
I just need to make one quick phone call.

37:28.982 --> 37:31.650
Uh, in the meantime,
who was it who wanted coffee?

37:33.820 --> 37:38.356
Yeah, okay, uh, this young lady
will get you coffee...

37:38.392 --> 37:41.660
and, also, doughnuts if there are any left.

37:51.371 --> 37:54.506
I want coffee, but I do not want cream.

37:54.541 --> 37:58.076
Hey, Julie, it's me,
returning Howard's call.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.778
Yeah.

38:03.350 --> 38:04.516
Hey, what's up?

38:04.551 --> 38:06.518
Jimmy, I have just one question...

38:06.553 --> 38:08.086
Are you behind this?

38:08.121 --> 38:10.555
Am I behind what?

38:42.422 --> 38:44.956
Jimmy, I'm kind of in the middle
of something' right now.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.458
- Come back later.
- No, no, no.

38:46.493 --> 38:47.959
Come on. Open the door.

38:47.995 --> 38:50.562
I know why you're here.
We can discuss it later.

38:50.886 --> 38:52.589
Right now I'm busy. Goodbye.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.083
You happy now?

39:23.263 --> 39:26.297
It's not right... Me not having'
a key to this place.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.770
Chuck?

40:01.668 --> 40:05.336
So, Chuck... uh, what's up?

40:14.848 --> 40:16.648
Um...

40:18.185 --> 40:23.688
You got a little, uh...

40:23.723 --> 40:28.259
You got a little, uh, uh, project going' on?

40:30.497 --> 40:33.731
Uh, something you maybe wanna tell me about?

40:35.102 --> 40:38.411
What do you say Chuck? Clue me in?

40:39.606 --> 40:42.707
These walls are plaster and lath...

40:42.742 --> 40:45.477
completely invisible to the radio spectrum.

40:45.512 --> 40:47.212
No protection at all...

40:47.247 --> 40:49.314
I might as well be standing
in the middle of a pasture.

40:49.349 --> 40:50.915
I don't know what I was thinking.

40:50.951 --> 40:52.584
I should've done this from the start.

40:52.619 --> 40:56.254
What, you should've done
this, with the, uh...

40:56.289 --> 40:58.256
See, I think these walls
are pretty solid. I think...

40:58.291 --> 41:00.992
See, what I really need
is a proper Faraday cage.

41:01.027 --> 41:02.660
That's what I need.

41:02.696 --> 41:06.264
I think we need to sit down,
take a break, buddy.

41:06.299 --> 41:07.332
Please?

41:07.367 --> 41:09.534
Do not patronize me, Jimmy.

41:09.569 --> 41:11.669
I'm not crazy, all right?

41:11.705 --> 41:14.213
What? I never said you were crazy.

41:14.286 --> 41:16.453
That... You're probably exhausted,

41:16.476 --> 41:18.042
a-and justifiably.

41:18.078 --> 41:19.844
Hey, come on. Hey.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.579
Five minutes, and then right back at it.

41:21.615 --> 41:23.715
I'm fine.

41:23.750 --> 41:25.116
Come on, Chuck.

41:26.753 --> 41:28.620
Just a break.

41:30.590 --> 41:33.057
- Careful.
- I know.

41:46.173 --> 41:48.540
Ohh.

41:51.745 --> 41:54.579
Howard tells me you quit HHM.

41:54.614 --> 41:56.814
I didn't quit.

41:56.850 --> 41:58.149
I retired.

41:58.185 --> 42:01.786
That's not what it sounded like.

42:01.821 --> 42:05.056
Regardless, it's kinda out of
the blue, don't you think?

42:05.091 --> 42:06.791
He's worried about you.

42:06.826 --> 42:08.993
He should be relieved.

42:09.029 --> 42:11.462
Relieved? Why would he be relieved?

42:11.498 --> 42:12.931
You're his Number One Guy.

42:12.966 --> 42:15.300
Without you, that whole place
goes down the drain.

42:16.803 --> 42:20.405
So, you... you retired...

42:20.440 --> 42:23.608
not just from HHM, but the law?

42:25.445 --> 42:28.746
That's not good, Chuck.

42:28.782 --> 42:32.083
The... The law... needs you.

42:32.118 --> 42:35.086
Just stop it.

42:35.121 --> 42:37.622
And you need it.

42:37.657 --> 42:40.325
What brought this on exactly, Chuck?

42:40.360 --> 42:41.359
Huh?

42:43.230 --> 42:46.664
'Cause I don't know what you are
if you're not a lawyer.

42:48.868 --> 42:50.335
Hey...

42:50.370 --> 42:53.338
How are you gonna retire
before you get me disbarred,

42:53.373 --> 42:55.340
before you run me out
of the town on a rail, huh?

42:55.375 --> 42:57.375
I'll be the only McGill
carrying the family name.

42:57.410 --> 42:59.010
You can't have that.

43:01.715 --> 43:05.416
Is this... Cause you lost Mesa Verde?

43:06.820 --> 43:09.454
So what? Who cares?

43:09.489 --> 43:11.823
And, hey, if you truly do think

43:11.858 --> 43:13.191
that I ratfucked you on that thing...

43:13.226 --> 43:14.626
which I did not, but whatever...

43:14.661 --> 43:16.027
well, you know what?

43:16.062 --> 43:17.962
You get mad! Take action!

43:17.998 --> 43:20.865
Don't just hide out in your...
your Faraday whatever...

43:20.900 --> 43:22.400
your cage thing here.

43:22.435 --> 43:25.136
No! You... No retirement for you!

43:25.171 --> 43:27.972
When you're 99, you can drop dead

43:28.008 --> 43:30.808
giving closing arguments to JudgeBot 3000...

43:30.844 --> 43:32.977
which will run on electricity, by the way.

43:33.013 --> 43:34.746
That's your future, okay?

43:34.781 --> 43:37.849
- So...
- I...

43:37.884 --> 43:40.051
I can't do the job anymore.

43:40.086 --> 43:42.553
What do you mean?
Of course you can do the job.

43:42.589 --> 43:43.688
I made a mistake.

43:43.723 --> 43:45.089
What mistake?

43:45.125 --> 43:47.859
A simple, nothing little bank address...

43:47.894 --> 43:50.561
- 1216 instead of 1261.
- Oh.

43:50.597 --> 43:51.896
I screwed it up!

43:51.931 --> 43:53.498
I hurt the client.

43:55.602 --> 43:59.604
Blew it completely and utterly.

43:59.639 --> 44:03.441
And then I blamed... And then I blamed you.

44:06.246 --> 44:08.713
It's this goddamned electricity!

44:08.748 --> 44:12.183
It's wearing me down!
It's wearing down my faculties!

44:12.218 --> 44:17.955
My brain... my mind... it used to be...

44:17.991 --> 44:19.457
You know, it used to work!

44:19.492 --> 44:21.025
And now it doesn't anymore.

44:21.061 --> 44:25.330
Mnh. People got hurt because of me.

44:26.499 --> 44:29.233
Time to end it.

44:36.009 --> 44:39.477
What if I told you
you didn't make a mistake?

44:40.814 --> 44:43.448
For Christ's sakes, Jimmy, stop humoring me.

44:43.483 --> 44:45.583
Stop trying to talk everything right.

44:48.588 --> 44:50.321
Mnh.

44:50.357 --> 44:52.924
I ratfucked you.

44:54.961 --> 44:57.462
It was me.

44:57.497 --> 45:00.598
I would've made Nixon proud.

45:03.169 --> 45:06.437
I changed 1261 to 1216.

45:07.941 --> 45:10.608
It was me.

45:10.643 --> 45:14.312
It all went down exactly like you said...

45:14.347 --> 45:17.915
I mean, exactly.

45:17.951 --> 45:19.917
I doctored the copies.

45:19.953 --> 45:22.587
I paid the kid at the shop to lie for me.

45:22.622 --> 45:24.455
It is insane

45:24.491 --> 45:29.527
how you got every detail exactly right.

45:31.498 --> 45:33.431
So you can relax, okay?

45:33.466 --> 45:35.666
'Cause that brain of yours is chugging along

45:35.702 --> 45:38.336
at 1,000% efficiency.

45:39.572 --> 45:42.006
Are you telling the truth,

45:42.041 --> 45:45.977
or are you just trying
to make me feel better?

45:46.012 --> 45:47.845
I am saying' it to make you feel better.

45:47.881 --> 45:51.215
I sure as shit wouldn't
be telling you otherwise.

45:51.251 --> 45:55.052
But, yes... It's the truth.

45:56.256 --> 45:58.623
You'd go to such lengths to humiliate me?

45:58.658 --> 46:01.159
I did it for Kim!

46:01.194 --> 46:04.996
What... She worked her butt off
to get Mesa Verde

46:05.031 --> 46:09.066
while you and Howard sat around
sipping scotch and chortling.

46:09.102 --> 46:12.170
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill...
More like Scrooge and Marley!

46:12.205 --> 46:16.674
Kim deserves Mesa Verde... Not you, not HHM.

46:16.709 --> 46:19.310
She earned it, and she needs it!

46:19.345 --> 46:21.012
I did it to help her,

46:21.047 --> 46:24.382
but I... I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

46:24.417 --> 46:27.251
I thought you'd just say,
"Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

46:27.287 --> 46:29.687
and go on with your life,
like a normal person!

46:29.722 --> 46:31.022
But, oh, no!

46:31.057 --> 46:32.924
Wishful thinking!

46:43.636 --> 46:46.070
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

46:46.105 --> 46:49.207
you're not quitting or retiring or whatever?

46:57.317 --> 47:00.384
And can we take all this shit
down off the walls?

47:05.658 --> 47:07.859
I'm gonna go call Howard.

47:07.894 --> 47:09.427
Jimmy.

47:11.931 --> 47:16.200
You do realize you
just confessed to a felony?

47:16.236 --> 47:18.302
I guess.

47:18.338 --> 47:20.471
But you feel better, right?

47:21.774 --> 47:24.509
Besides, it's your word against mine.
