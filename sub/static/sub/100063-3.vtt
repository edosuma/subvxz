01:00.103 --> 01:01.844
though, later,
there was quite a scandal

01:01.887 --> 01:05.065
when many claimed the ceremony
was, in fact, performed

01:05.108 --> 01:08.198
by Stigand,
the uncanonically electedHiggy.

Oh, my God.
You're getting water everywhere.

Relax.
It's just some drops.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.123
I-I'll wipe it off. Wait, wait,

01:20.167 --> 01:22.212
wait, wait, wait.
No, I can handle it.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.736
Why are you in here
half-naked anyway?

01:24.780 --> 01:27.087
Well, I was taking a shower,
and the lights

01:27.130 --> 01:29.045
kept flickering on
and off like crazy.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.178
Is something wrong
with the panel?

01:31.221 --> 01:33.615
No, there's nothing wrong.

01:33.658 --> 01:36.226
This little device allows me

01:36.270 --> 01:38.117
to remotely switch on and off
all the smart lights

01:38.141 --> 01:40.230
around the property
to conserve energy.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.754
Seems that someone,
who shall remain nameless,

01:42.798 --> 01:44.950
has been leaving their lights on
when they're not around,

01:44.974 --> 01:48.586
which is contributing to
his sky-high electricity bill.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.414
Plus, it's just not very green.

01:50.458 --> 01:54.070
So switching the lights
off when I'm showering

01:54.114 --> 01:55.854
is somehow going green?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.813
No, no. That's just me
having a little fun.

01:57.856 --> 02:00.381
Can you find some other way
to amuse yourself?

02:00.424 --> 02:01.619
Well, actually,
I've been listening

02:01.643 --> 02:03.775
to a really fascinating podcast

02:03.819 --> 02:05.168
on the Battle of Hastings.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.169
Battle of Hastings.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.910
I know the Battle of Hastings.

02:07.953 --> 02:11.174
That's when England got their
butts kicked by the French,

02:11.218 --> 02:12.958
like, a thousand years ago.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.308
And, uh, it was right off

02:14.351 --> 02:16.179
the southern coast of Britain,
I believe.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.615
Right?

02:17.659 --> 02:19.506
Pretty bad home loss
for you guys. I'm just saying.

02:19.530 --> 02:23.273
I'd prefer to call it
a temporary setback for Blighty.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.536
You know,
not to put any pressure on you,

02:25.580 --> 02:28.191
but is there any movement
on that whole...

02:28.235 --> 02:31.629
Thomas Magnum
versus MI6 decision?

02:31.673 --> 02:34.197
I've told you, I'm
still thinking about it.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.286
I'm weighing up my options.

02:36.330 --> 02:40.160
You're leaning towards MI6,
aren't you?

02:41.248 --> 02:44.207
I'm not leaning either way.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.866
What's with all the tidying up?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.911
We have VIPs coming
to town, remember?

02:52.955 --> 02:55.175
Robin's publisher's
son and his fiancée.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.240
They're staying in the
guesthouse for the weekend. Yes.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.004
Forgot about that.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.330
It's all right. I booked
you into the Hilton

03:00.354 --> 03:02.312
Hawaiian Village. Oh, you did?

03:02.356 --> 03:05.228
That's great. They have a really
nice pool bar over there.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.510
The inconvenience only
covers the room and tax.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.883
No incidentals.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.277
So you will be responsible
for those expenses.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.061
Although, of course,
you'll probably just...

03:12.104 --> 03:13.628
mooch some beers off

03:13.671 --> 03:15.717
your BFF Rick and transport
them to the pool.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.981
I know. You can even
get TC to fly some in.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.156
Very funny.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.549
Juliet,

03:21.592 --> 03:24.900
you must tell Mr. Masters'
guests to find a hotel.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.250
Why? I just found

03:27.294 --> 03:29.209
a dead owl down by the beach.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.775
Why would our guests
change their plans

03:30.819 --> 03:32.342
because of a dead bird?

03:32.386 --> 03:35.302
Because our pueo
is no ordinary bird.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.565
In Hawaiian culture,
it's an aumakua,

03:37.608 --> 03:39.306
a guardian spirit,

03:39.349 --> 03:43.223
one who has watched over and
protected this estate for years.

03:43.266 --> 03:46.095
Without that protection,

03:46.138 --> 03:48.010
I'm afraid
bad things will happen.

03:48.053 --> 03:50.099
Kumu, you don't
actually believe in all that...

03:50.142 --> 03:52.275
superstition and mythology,
do you?

03:52.319 --> 03:53.668
Why not?

03:53.711 --> 03:55.017
I mean...

03:55.060 --> 03:57.106
I don't know,
take my Tigers cap, for example.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.587
I bought it midway
through the 2012 season,

03:59.630 --> 04:01.676
wore it for every game
and what happened?

04:01.719 --> 04:03.678
Tigers won the
American League pennant.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.680
Right. So your...

04:05.723 --> 04:08.422
hat is to thank for that, is it?

04:08.465 --> 04:10.337
Well, you can't say it wasn't.Very well.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.315
Then how do you explain
all the subsequent failures?

04:12.339 --> 04:15.167
A superstition is just...

04:15.211 --> 04:16.733
a trick of the mind.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.214
Statistically,
it doesn't hold up.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.521
Suit yourself.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.216
Yeah?
What's the issue?

05:04.260 --> 05:06.523
You. For a guy who ran a club,

05:06.567 --> 05:09.352
you don't know jack
about maintaining a beer tap.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.920
You've got yeast buildup
in your lines,

05:11.963 --> 05:14.357
and the... there's not enough
air pressure in the system.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.054
Okay, but can you fix it?

05:17.491 --> 05:19.971
Shammy the man.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.365
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate you,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.367
and I appreciate your service.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.716
Hang on.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.457
Just want to be clear
about something.

05:27.501 --> 05:30.068
If I drink this,
that is not me accepting

05:30.112 --> 05:32.680
this beer as payment
for my work here.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.377
No, of course not.
I got cash.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.510
I'm good for it.
Hey.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.903
Noah, get over here, man.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.558
Dude, it's 4:00.
You're late.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.406
Yeah, I know. I tried
to get here fast as I could.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.561
See, the thing is...

05:44.605 --> 05:45.973
I don't want to hear
any excuses, man.

05:45.997 --> 05:46.955
I gave you a job,

05:46.998 --> 05:48.130
didn't I?

05:48.173 --> 05:49.697
Now, you need to show up

05:49.740 --> 05:51.481
and earn it.
And part of that

05:51.525 --> 05:52.830
is showing up on time.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.745
I don't think
that's too much to ask.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.834
Yeah. You're right. Sorry.

05:56.878 --> 05:59.054
Get to work.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.192
What?

06:07.236 --> 06:10.413
You talk to a grown-ass man
like that?

06:10.457 --> 06:11.782
What? I'm supposed
to let the guy off the hook?

06:11.806 --> 06:13.155
He's 20 minutes late.

06:13.198 --> 06:17.072
No, but maybe the stress
of taking this joint over

06:17.115 --> 06:18.465
is getting to you

06:18.508 --> 06:21.859
and you just took it out
on one of your employees.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.733
All right,
maybe you guys have a point.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.344
Look, man,
you just got to relax.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.042
Take it from a guy
that started his own business.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.044
The early days are the worst.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.743
You're gonna have a lot
of sleepless nights.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.614
But it gets a little better.

06:37.658 --> 06:41.879
It's not taking this place over
that's got me stressed.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.534
It's the fact
that you backed me, man.

06:44.578 --> 06:45.927
I don't want to let you down.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.668
I don't want you
to let me down either.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.844
I ain't Robin.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.281
I do not have money to burn.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.239
But I believe in you.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.547
And, look, if this
doesn't work out,

06:57.591 --> 06:59.419
I'll be a little tight.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.899
But I won't have any regrets.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.901
Thanks, man.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.430
Hey. Noah.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.562
Hey, man. Let me talk
to you for a sec.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.216
Hey.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.523
Listen, man.
I'm sorry about before.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.873
I had no right
to speak to you that way.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.004
No, it's cool.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.484
You okay?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.659
Yeah.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.619
See, the thing is,
my car got stolen.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.621
And that was the reason
why I was late.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.231
Sorry to hear that, man.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.625
All my clothes and everything
was in there,

07:31.668 --> 07:33.540
including my Marine uniform.

07:33.583 --> 07:37.326
Wait, you mean to tell me that
you're living out of your car?

07:37.369 --> 07:39.241
Man, I lost everything.

07:39.284 --> 07:42.200
Well, let me advance you
some salary.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.202
No, it's okay. No, no, please.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.596
I-I want this to be more
than a place of work, you know?

07:46.640 --> 07:48.555
I want the people here
to be like family.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.557
One that looks out
for each other.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.473
I appreciate it, but
I still can't take your money.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.626
All right, look, I-I got
a couple buddies at the HPD.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.781
Let me make some calls

07:57.825 --> 07:59.783
and see what I can do.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.955
You see,
I-I think you like this.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.566
I think...
you enjoy being courted.

08:43.610 --> 08:47.657
It's some weird connection to
you never dating as a teenager.

08:47.701 --> 08:51.487
Oh, I'm sorry we weren't all
on the pull like some people.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.184
"On the pull"? It's British

08:53.228 --> 08:55.796
for messing around with
random strangers, constantly.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.363
And, no, I didn't date a lot
as a teenager.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.669
But I'll have you know

08:59.713 --> 09:02.672
that I did actually entertain
one or two...

09:02.716 --> 09:05.588
rather...
fetching callers.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.809
Okay, so you didn't kiss a boy
until you were an adult.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.419
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.812
Is this really how you intend

09:11.855 --> 09:13.640
to convince me to be
your partner, Magnum?

09:13.683 --> 09:14.641
By ridiculing me?

09:14.684 --> 09:17.948
That's not a very good strategy.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.125
Ooh, got to go.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.127
Guests have arrived.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.305
Oh, I still can't believe

09:27.349 --> 09:29.220
that we actually get
to stay at the estate

09:29.264 --> 09:31.658
where Robin Masters created
the White Knight novels.Mm.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.268
Are you a White Knight fan?

09:33.311 --> 09:34.617
Huge fan.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.053
That is true.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.708
I even attempted to write
some fan fiction last year.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.405
It was terrible.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.494
I liked it.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.279
My dad told me
that some of the stuff

09:44.322 --> 09:46.281
in the book actually happened.

09:46.324 --> 09:49.763
That the White Knight
was based on a real Navy SEAL.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.330
Now, did Masters
ever tell you who that was?

09:53.767 --> 09:56.291
Well, I'm sorry to say
that Robin

09:56.334 --> 09:57.945
never shared that secret.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.468
Aw, come on.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.688
Come on. We won't tell anybody.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.951
I'm afraid I don't know.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.998
Find that hard to believe.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.045
Well,

10:11.088 --> 10:13.047
be that as it may,

10:13.090 --> 10:14.831
it's the truth.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.052
Oh, let me clear these for you.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.073
Oh, no, please let us clear.
It's the least we can do.Yeah.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.534
No, no, no. Please, you
are... you are our guests.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.536
Oh, remember to save the bones
for the lads.

10:25.363 --> 10:26.974
Actually,

10:27.017 --> 10:28.540
where are the lads?

10:30.717 --> 10:33.545
Zeus! Apollo!

10:41.728 --> 10:43.251
That's in the guesthouse.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.654
Did you put them
in the guesthouse?

10:44.687 --> 10:45.993
No.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.700
Think you're outgunned
there, honey.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.925
Right.
I'm gonna go out on a limb

11:04.968 --> 11:06.729
and say that neither of you
are related to Robin

11:06.753 --> 11:08.450
or his publisher in any way.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.321
What gave that away?

11:10.365 --> 11:12.976
So, what did you do?

11:13.020 --> 11:14.456
Hack into Robin's account

11:14.499 --> 11:16.042
and send me an e-mail,
pretending to be him?

11:16.066 --> 11:18.068
Then I'm assuming
you configured his account

11:18.112 --> 11:19.417
to reroute any correspondence

11:19.461 --> 11:21.724
from me directly to an account
under your control.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.117
That's close enough.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.988
One step further,
and he's gonna put

11:25.032 --> 11:26.468
a hole in Ms. Tuileta.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.995
Good girl.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.867
Now, where are the controls
for the main gate?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.749
What do you want?

11:46.793 --> 11:48.229
We want your boss's safe.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.883
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.363
You've come a very long way
for nothing.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.080
Mr. Masters doesn't have
a safe on this property.

11:54.104 --> 11:57.020
Well, we have a very reliable
source that says different.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.893
And according to him, there's a
hidden wall safe in the study.

11:59.936 --> 12:00.936
Now move.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.776
Try to make yourselves
comfortable.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.482
Now do you believe me

12:24.526 --> 12:25.745
about the aumakua?

12:25.788 --> 12:29.357
Kumu, I will never doubt you
ever again.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.976
Hey, look who I just saw
in the, uh, parking lot.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.717
Gordy's in the house.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.893
I thought you were laid up
at the Hilton.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.852
No. On my way there now.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.028
I just want to stop
and grab a drink real quick.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.465
How about one of those, uh,
"friend of the owner" beers?

12:50.508 --> 12:52.554
Sorry, pal.
No more freebies here.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.950
Hey, the brother's
just trying to run a business.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.301
Hey. How's it
going, Detective?

13:00.344 --> 13:02.085
Katsumoto, thank you for coming.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.478
Well, it sounded pretty urgent.

13:03.521 --> 13:04.629
What's going on? RICK:
One of my employees

13:04.653 --> 13:06.176
had his car stolen.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.351
You said on the phone

13:07.395 --> 13:08.352
that a serious crime
had been committed.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.658
Yeah, and it was.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.051
All of his stuff
was in that car.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.227
You do know I'm
Robbery-Homicide, right? I mean,

13:13.270 --> 13:15.142
auto theft's a little
beneath my pay grade.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.013
I think you're picking
up some bad habits

13:17.057 --> 13:18.841
from Magnum, calling
on friends for favors.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.321
So you won't help.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.062
Here's an idea.
Why not ask

13:22.105 --> 13:24.225
everyone's favorite pet
detective to look for the car.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.415
Okay, that-that hurt.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.286
Good. RICK: Look,

13:29.330 --> 13:31.375
Thomas, he-he's a one-man show.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.290
You, you got, like,
a whole police force

13:33.334 --> 13:34.654
at your disposal. KATSUMOTO:
Yeah.

13:34.683 --> 13:35.878
To investigate serious crimes.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.512
Murders. Assaults.
Abductions.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.882
I mean, I'm sorry. A stolen car
doesn't fall into that category.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.516
Okay, maybe not.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.213
But Noah, he's a veteran.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.172
U.S. Marine.
He served our country.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.521
He deserves our help.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.399
I'll put an alert out,
put some pressure on patrol.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.748
That's the best I can do.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.359
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13:58.402 --> 14:01.666
Can I offer you
a "friend of the owner" beer?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.539
No, I'm still on duty.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.323
I'll call you
if I hear anything, okay?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.412
TC. Shammy.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.153
Good seeing you. All right.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.548
Uh, you see that? The guy
didn't even acknowledge me.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.463
He's not gonna forgive me,
is he?

14:15.506 --> 14:17.378
Probably no time soon.

14:17.421 --> 14:20.381
How about that "friend of
the owner" beer he passed up on?

14:20.424 --> 14:22.165
You know what?

14:22.209 --> 14:23.906
Break out that wallet
you got there,

14:23.950 --> 14:25.516
you can have
all the beers you want.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.389
All right.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.999
I'm out.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.479
Oh.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.828
So that's it?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.917
No beer. Got to go.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.310
Surprise, surprise.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.193
I just remembered
I left my Tigers cap at home.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.356
Oh, no, forget that.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.680
Let me sell you
a La Mariana cap.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.055
It's my lucky cap.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.273
Tigers are playing tomorrow.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.667
We need the win,
so I got to be wearing it.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.712
See you guys.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.771
Oh, yeah.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.947
That's what I'm talking about.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.949
You have the code?

15:22.747 --> 15:24.314
What's wrong?

15:25.359 --> 15:26.664
I don't know.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.538
I bet you wish
you stayed in London

15:30.581 --> 15:32.714
and took that job.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.759
Thought had occurred to me.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.894
Have you decided anything yet?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.288
No.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.768
You're really dragging this out,
aren't you?

15:43.812 --> 15:46.380
I didn't expect to.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.513
I really thought I'd say yes
as soon as I got to London.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.124
What stopped you?

15:51.167 --> 15:53.996
I began to wonder...

15:54.040 --> 15:57.782
if the job would mean anything
without Richard.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.917
I don't know that it would.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.746
So why are you
still considering it?

16:04.789 --> 16:07.009
Because perhaps I'm wrong.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.011
Or...

16:09.055 --> 16:11.622
you're too scared to stay here.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.624
Meaning?

16:13.668 --> 16:16.584
There are people here
you've gotten close to.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.629
That frightens you.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.249
Masters changed the code
to the safe, didn't he?

16:29.292 --> 16:31.816
The one we had, 695101...

16:31.860 --> 16:33.383
It's not working.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.733
I already told you, we don't
know anything about any safe.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.953
See, I find that
hard to believe.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.346
What's the code?

16:41.783 --> 16:44.699
Oh! For God's sakes,
we don't know it.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.223
Enough lies. I want
the damn code.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.529
Please. HIGGINS: Listen,

16:48.572 --> 16:49.747
she doesn't know the code.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.662
But I do.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.867
Well, I have to admit,
I'm impressed.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.719
Most people would've
given up the code by now.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.502
I'm not most people.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.991
We can do this all night.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.819
Even if I give you the code?

17:18.863 --> 17:20.691
What are you hoping
to find in the safe?

17:20.734 --> 17:22.650
This isn't Mr. Masters'
primary residence,

17:22.693 --> 17:25.653
which means there won't be
anything in there of any value.

17:25.695 --> 17:26.891
Well, if there's
nothing of value,

17:26.915 --> 17:28.196
then why don't you
just give us the code.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.831
And I think we all know

17:29.874 --> 17:31.635
there's something valuable
in there, don't we?

17:31.659 --> 17:33.965
Information. Specifically,

17:34.009 --> 17:35.117
the answer to Sam's question

17:35.141 --> 17:36.751
he asked you at dinner.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.147
You want to know the identity
of the White Knight.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.239
And you think Robin
just keeps that secret

17:46.282 --> 17:47.805
here in his safe? LINA:
Well, we know

17:47.849 --> 17:49.633
for a fact that he keeps
all his research

17:49.677 --> 17:51.287
for his novels at this estate,

17:51.331 --> 17:52.854
where most of those books
were written.

17:52.897 --> 17:57.032
So, somewhere in the notes,
transcripts and recordings,

17:57.076 --> 17:59.904
you believe there to be
the name of the Navy SEAL

17:59.948 --> 18:02.907
that the Knight is based on.

18:02.951 --> 18:05.606
Well...

18:05.649 --> 18:08.174
you're going through
a hell of an effort to get

18:08.217 --> 18:10.263
that information,
which makes you either

18:10.306 --> 18:12.917
the most disturbed White Knight
fans I've ever met...

18:14.919 --> 18:16.834
or you want to ask him

18:16.878 --> 18:18.793
about something
in one of the books.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.580
That's it, isn't it?

18:26.322 --> 18:28.237
This must be personal,

18:28.281 --> 18:30.109
the amount of effort
you're going to.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.154
Actually,
we're just the hired help.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.851
Like you.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.418
Just doing it for the money.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.812
All right. So who hired you?

18:38.813 --> 18:40.162
Don't worry about that.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.469
Okay. So,

18:42.512 --> 18:45.124
you find out the identity
of the White Knight. What then?

18:46.168 --> 18:48.649
That's not up to us,
but I am certain

18:48.692 --> 18:50.999
that it is not gonna end well
for him.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.991
I'm getting real impatient.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.211
Either you give us
that code soon,

19:29.255 --> 19:31.102
or I'm-a bring that old lady
up here, and I'm-a treat her

19:31.126 --> 19:33.084
the exact same way
I'm treating you.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.217
And I suspect
she won't be as resilient.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.914
You'd be surprised.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.136
What is it?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.877
There's a Ferrari
in the driveway.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.052
I thought you said Magnum

19:44.095 --> 19:45.575
was supposed to be gone
this weekend.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.664
I don't control Magnum.
He does what he wants.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.318
He's probably here just...

19:49.362 --> 19:50.798
He forgot something.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.278
He'll be gone in a few minutes.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.802
Jam the cell phones
and then find him.

19:56.543 --> 19:59.415
I think it's time
we interrogate Ms. Tuileta.

19:59.459 --> 20:00.784
No, I'm telling you,
she doesn't...

20:00.808 --> 20:02.723
She doesn't know anything.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.246
She's the curator of the estate.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.595
Why would she know the code?

20:05.639 --> 20:07.293
You'd be wasting your time.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.340
Come on.

20:42.023 --> 20:45.461
You didn't have
to sacrifice yourself for me.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.855
It wasn't just for you.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.987
Battle strategy, Kumu.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.337
I'm sorry?

20:51.380 --> 20:52.990
I had to see
what we're dealing with,

20:53.034 --> 20:54.427
how many gunmen are upstairs.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.559
I was taking inventory
of the situation.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.126
Well, while you were doing that,

20:58.169 --> 21:01.172
I-I was racking my brain,
trying to figure out

21:01.216 --> 21:03.653
who told Sam and Lina

21:03.697 --> 21:05.655
about Mr. Masters' safe.

21:05.699 --> 21:08.179
I was also trying to knock
that bottle off...

21:08.223 --> 21:09.616
off onto the floor.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.270
I figure we could use
the broken glass

21:11.313 --> 21:13.184
to cut these ties.

21:13.228 --> 21:16.144
Of course,
we'd still be locked in here.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.406
Well, hopefully by that time,

21:17.450 --> 21:18.644
Magnum will have figured out
where we are.

21:18.668 --> 21:22.150
How? Thomas is gone
for the weekend.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.804
He's come back for some reason.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.849
The Ferrari's in the driveway.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.287
Is there any way to signal him?

21:29.331 --> 21:31.159
Yeah, maybe.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.988
Can you... reach my pocket?

21:35.381 --> 21:37.252
You got it?

21:37.296 --> 21:39.254
Yeah. The remote
for the lights?

21:39.298 --> 21:41.517
Yeah.
What are you
gonna do with this?

21:41.561 --> 21:43.824
I have an idea.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.260
I just hope that Magnum

21:45.304 --> 21:48.002
was paying attention
at the Naval Academy.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.925
Higgins?

Three dots, three dashes,

22:22.166 --> 22:23.429
three dots.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.692
That's not Higgins
messing with me again.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.347
That's an SOS.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.746
♪

22:53.415 --> 22:55.417
You better be looking
for loose change.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.071
Uh...

22:57.114 --> 23:00.335
is this 2432 Portlock Road?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.250
No.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.600
My bad.
It's the wrong house. Uh...

23:04.644 --> 23:07.429
you don't mind if I
just jump back in the car and... Walk.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.188

Come on.

Come on!

23:33.237 --> 23:35.326
I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

23:35.370 --> 23:39.113
About you being afraid
to get close to people.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.464
It was out of line. No, no, it's all right.

23:42.508 --> 23:46.337
People tend to be brutally
honest in situations like this.

23:46.381 --> 23:47.382
Um...

23:48.514 --> 23:50.080
You're not wrong.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.865
I am frightened.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.910
I know.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.391
After all you've been through...

23:56.435 --> 23:57.479
it's hard,

23:57.523 --> 24:00.482
but... if we
get out of this,

24:00.526 --> 24:02.745
you can't go through the rest
of your life like that.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.048
What are you doing?

24:47.181 --> 24:48.312
I think...

24:48.356 --> 24:50.706
I have a way to get us out.
Hold that.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.708
I hope your plan isn't
to saw through the lock

24:52.752 --> 24:53.796
with that tiny blade.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.844
Not exactly.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.499
This thermometer doesn't use
mercury, but gallium.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.152
It alloys with most metals.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.546
So when it comes
into contact with the lock,

25:04.590 --> 25:06.505
it should diffuse
into the grain boundaries,

25:06.548 --> 25:07.984
weakening the iron to the point

25:08.028 --> 25:09.266
where it becomes
extremely brittle

25:09.290 --> 25:12.119
and will crumble and break.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.903
You never cease
to amaze me, Juliet.

by the former owners of the
estate back in the '60s.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.608
It was supposed to save them
from a nuclear winter.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.568

You've reached Thomas Magnum.

Please leave a message.

It's Katsumoto.

The White Knight?

28:37.628 --> 28:38.760
It's Thomas Magnum.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.849
The guy who lives
in the guesthouse?

28:40.893 --> 28:42.590
I guess Masters wanted
to make sure

28:42.633 --> 28:43.872
his golden goose
was comfortable.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.941
We have a problem.

They're gone.

- They're out.
- How?

28:52.078 --> 28:54.907
Does it matter?
Find them and kill them.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.169

29:00.956 --> 29:02.697
Are you sure we should
be doing this?

We need to disable
their means of escape

29:04.438 --> 29:05.718
before we can make our advances.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.484
Classic battle strategy.

Hey!

29:42.563 --> 29:44.870
Thomas Magnum, I presume?

29:44.913 --> 29:46.523
Or should I say
the White Knight?

29:51.093 --> 29:52.312
Get to work.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.229
It's been a rough night.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.057

30:00.842 --> 30:02.191
Put him in the car.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.628
It's immobile.
Tires are slashed.

30:04.672 --> 30:05.978
Then find another car.

30:11.374 --> 30:12.680
Keep going.

Get back.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.543
Detective.

30:52.111 --> 30:53.677
What the hell happened here?

30:53.721 --> 30:55.766
It's a long story. HIGGINS:
Let's just say we had

30:55.810 --> 30:56.855
some rather unruly guests,

30:56.898 --> 30:58.247
all armed and well-trained.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.596
Where's Magnum?

30:59.640 --> 31:00.704
They've grabbed him
and they've taken off

31:00.728 --> 31:01.792
in one of Mr. Masters' cars.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.165
Any idea where they are?

31:03.209 --> 31:04.534
I'm trying to access
some live satellite footage,

31:04.558 --> 31:05.796
but I feel that by the time
the sat realigns,

31:05.820 --> 31:08.344
they're going to be out
of the coverage area.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.346
Evan Butler. What?

31:10.390 --> 31:11.913
He was Mr. Masters'
research assistant

31:11.957 --> 31:13.001
here on the island.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.829
Had a terrible gambling problem.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.285
Got fired because
he tried to sell off

31:16.309 --> 31:18.267
an early draft
of Queen's Gambitfor cash.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.835
That was almost
four years ago.
So?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.924
So the code they used
for the safe

31:22.968 --> 31:24.839
was the same code
from four years ago.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.234
I'm remembering it now
because Mr. Masters changed it

31:28.277 --> 31:29.409
right after he fired Evan.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.280
So you think this
Evan Butler might be

31:31.324 --> 31:32.760
Sam and Lina's inside source.

31:32.803 --> 31:35.043
Okay, I'm lost. Who is this guy,
and does he have Magnum?

31:35.067 --> 31:37.852
No. But I think he can
help us find him.

31:39.723 --> 31:43.727
Evan Butler, HPD!
Come on out.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.773
What's going on? Kumu?

31:45.816 --> 31:46.948
What are you doing?

31:46.992 --> 31:48.602
You sold the code
to Mr. Masters' safe

31:48.645 --> 31:49.927
to a couple of mercenaries,
didn't you?

31:49.951 --> 31:51.692
What? Answer the question.

31:51.735 --> 31:52.930
I-I don't even know
what she's talking about.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.651
Be smart, Mr. Butler.

31:54.695 --> 31:57.480
I-I need to speak to a lawyer.

31:58.655 --> 32:01.963
A good man who served
his country with honor

32:02.007 --> 32:03.967
is going to be killed
for doing his job.Higgins...

32:04.009 --> 32:05.140
And that's on you.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.969
How do you communicate
with them? Tell us.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.710
Higgins.

32:09.753 --> 32:10.798
Answer him.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.278
You gonna let her do this?!

32:16.325 --> 32:17.718
Higgins!

32:19.459 --> 32:21.417
The next one won't hit
the floorboards, okay?

32:21.461 --> 32:22.897
Uh, I spoke to them by cell.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.768
It was a-a 719 area code.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.858
The number's in
my phone over there.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.427
Got it. This is Detective
Katsumoto. I need

32:31.471 --> 32:34.735
a ping on a cell phone
right away... 719-555-0132.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.955
Turn around.

32:39.479 --> 32:40.741
Watch him until

32:40.784 --> 32:42.743
HPD arrives.

32:44.136 --> 32:46.703
You better pray
my friend is still alive.

32:54.885 --> 32:58.498
I understand,
but the terms have changed.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.456
Good.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.548
He'll be here shortly.

33:05.592 --> 33:07.028
Who?

33:07.072 --> 33:09.030
The man who hired us.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.118
What does he want with me?

33:10.162 --> 33:11.815
We'll leave that
for him to explain.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.434
Stay put.

33:21.477 --> 33:23.131
You're not going in there alone.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.046
I'm not gonna argue
with you about this.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.185
What are you doing here?

33:33.228 --> 33:34.838
Kumu called.

33:34.882 --> 33:36.014
You need to leave.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.146
Where's your backup? I have SWAT inbound.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.297
What the hell does that mean?

33:39.321 --> 33:41.062
That means they're
four minutes out.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.170
So you're really gonna wait?

33:42.194 --> 33:43.388
What the hell
are you guys doing?

33:43.412 --> 33:45.086
I just told you,
a SWAT team is on its way.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.938
Well, if Thomas is already dead,
they're not gonna be much help.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.375
Hey, you two need to stand down.

33:49.418 --> 33:52.595
Listen, brother, the only way
you're gonna stop us

33:52.639 --> 33:54.249
is with a bullet.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.296
Son of a bitch.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.100
Guys, I got no shot.

34:19.143 --> 34:20.841
What do you mean?

34:20.884 --> 34:23.061
I mean, from where I am,
I got no shot.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.975
Then make one, fool.

35:05.451 --> 35:08.236
Bloody hell, Magnum! Is
that how you thank someone

35:08.280 --> 35:10.084
for saving your life? That
man tried to drown me

35:10.108 --> 35:11.718
with water from Mr.
Masters' koi pond.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.391
I had some rather
unpleasant plans for him.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.113
Uh, worse than a bullet
to the head?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.160
Stay down!

36:07.077 --> 36:08.949
Ran prints on those four

36:08.992 --> 36:10.777
and the ones back at the estate,

36:10.820 --> 36:12.866
including the one you left
tied up in the bunker.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.824
No hits on any of 'em.
They're ghosts.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.348
And the bunker
guy's not talking.

36:16.391 --> 36:17.610
What about Lina's phone?

36:17.653 --> 36:19.089
We dumped it.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.700
There's one number
in the call history.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.224
Traced it back to a burner.
Belongs to someone named Ivan.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.617
Ivan?

36:24.660 --> 36:26.096
That name mean anything to you?

36:26.140 --> 36:28.011
No.You're sure?

36:28.055 --> 36:29.361
Positive.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.798
Is it possible that "Ivan" is

36:31.841 --> 36:34.235
an alias, or a-a code name?

36:34.279 --> 36:36.629
Thomas, you need
to call Captain Greene.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.650
Yeah, I'm with TC. Navy Intel
might be able to help.

36:38.674 --> 36:39.893
Let's hope so, because unless

36:39.936 --> 36:41.262
one of these guys comes back
from the dead

36:41.286 --> 36:43.244
with info on their
employer, or the...

36:43.288 --> 36:46.682
guy in custody decides to talk,
I'm afraid we've got nothing.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.162
Well, that's great.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.773
Got crosshairs on me,
and we don't have a single lead.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.035
We'll keep investigating.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.037
Hopefully, we'll get one.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.214
I got an update
on that, uh, stolen car.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.477
Yeah? You find it? What was left of it.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.913
It was stripped for parts.

36:59.956 --> 37:02.959
Contents inside are
gone, too. Sorry.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.831
Hey, Katsumoto?

37:08.138 --> 37:09.531
Thank you.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.065
Come on, man.

37:22.109 --> 37:23.980
Seven grand?
You can do better than that.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.069
Seven's a fair price.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.656
Come on, brah.
That man served his country.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.335
Don't you have, like, a
Veterans Day sale or something?

37:30.378 --> 37:33.033
Yeah, Veterans Day
is next month.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.252
You can't move it up?

37:34.295 --> 37:36.558
Come on. The guy lost
everything he owned.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.259
I might have something.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.216
That's what I want to hear.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.045
This can't be it.

37:47.352 --> 37:50.833
Tony. She ain't
much of a looker.

37:53.445 --> 37:56.317
How about $750?

37:56.361 --> 38:00.234
List price is, uh, $2,500.
I'll give it to you for 21.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.192
$2,100 for this?

38:02.236 --> 38:04.282
It's clearly been
in an accident,

38:04.325 --> 38:06.675
there's oil all over the
catalytic converter,

38:06.719 --> 38:08.547
it's got a blown head gasket.

38:08.590 --> 38:11.332
My lawn mower's in better shape
than this pile of junk.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.657
And the paint...
What's left of it...

38:12.681 --> 38:15.467
Okay, all right,
hang on. $1,275,

38:15.510 --> 38:16.859
plus, one free chopper tour

38:16.903 --> 38:19.340
and one night all you can drink

38:19.384 --> 38:20.904
at the new La Mariana.
What do you say?

38:30.699 --> 38:32.310
I'll go fetch the keys.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.748
He would've did it
without the free chopper ride.

38:35.791 --> 38:36.899
Oh, come on.
I give away something,

38:36.923 --> 38:37.967
you give away something.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.447
That's how we work.

38:39.491 --> 38:42.363
Man, thank you. You bet, man.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.322
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.367
Thank you. Yes, sir.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.198
Hello, Magnum.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.591
Hey, Higgy. Oh, uh,

38:52.634 --> 38:55.115
FYI, your dogs tore up
some of my stuff

38:55.158 --> 38:56.701
when we were trapped in here
the other day.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.161
Shame.

38:58.205 --> 38:59.511
Mm.Might I come in?

38:59.554 --> 39:01.556
Yes.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.561
I see they spared
your lucky hat.

39:06.605 --> 39:09.303
Told you, this thing has
good mojo. You want a beer?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.305
Sure.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.699
Just got off the
phone with Robin.

39:13.742 --> 39:16.702
Yeah, I spoke to him earlier.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.008
He seemed to take it
all in his stride.

39:19.052 --> 39:21.422
Yeah, he said it actually might
make for a good book someday.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.231
White Knight: Under Siege.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.886
Jolly good. I'm glad
Robin will be able to monetize

39:26.929 --> 39:28.627
our near-death experience.

39:28.670 --> 39:31.238
Eh, I'm used to it.

39:34.067 --> 39:36.809
So,

39:36.852 --> 39:39.812
there's something
that I've been wondering.

39:39.855 --> 39:44.817
How did you know to set
the trip wire on the beach?

39:44.860 --> 39:47.036
I... how did you know
I would even go there?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.603
You didn't know
that we'd escaped.

39:48.647 --> 39:51.258
True, but I know
how smart you are,

39:51.301 --> 39:55.262
and my gut was telling me
that you'd find a way.

39:55.305 --> 39:58.439
But how did you know
that I would run to the beach?

39:58.483 --> 39:59.614
Well, that's easy.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.137
The Battle of Hastings.

40:01.181 --> 40:02.356
What?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.706
You were listening to it
yesterday, remember?

40:04.750 --> 40:05.925
If it taught us anything,

40:05.968 --> 40:08.057
it's that,
when dealing with an adversary,

40:08.101 --> 40:10.451
you always lead them
to water in full retreat.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.410
That way, they think
they have the upper hand,

40:12.453 --> 40:14.760
and they will never know
the trap you laid for them.

40:15.804 --> 40:18.894
Yes, but I didn't lay the trap.
You did.

40:18.938 --> 40:21.114
True, but it's still
a great place for an ambush.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.744
There's low light,
lots of places to hide.

40:22.768 --> 40:26.859
Plus, I know how you think,
and I knew you'd go for it.

40:26.902 --> 40:29.339
Next you're going
to tell me that this is...

40:29.383 --> 40:31.559
This is why
we should be partners.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.478
You see that?

40:37.522 --> 40:40.133
We can even finish
each other's sentences.

40:43.397 --> 40:47.662
There is one point which
I do agree with you on.

40:47.706 --> 40:50.883
Despite our frequent
mutual contempt,

40:50.926 --> 40:52.493
I do think that we

40:52.537 --> 40:54.930
complement each other
rather well.

40:54.974 --> 40:57.977
As illustrated by
last night's siege.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.373
Why are you looking at me
like that?

41:03.417 --> 41:05.506
Because you're basically making
my case for me.

41:05.550 --> 41:08.030
This is why we need
to be partners.

41:08.074 --> 41:11.120
I saved your life,
you saved mine.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.471
You're like
the left brain to my right.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.231
You know, sometimes I think
it's rather presumptuous,

41:15.255 --> 41:16.604
you saying you have a brain.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.190
You said it yourself.
We complement each other.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.955
We need each other
to get the job done.

41:19.999 --> 41:22.436
Like Brady needed a-a lineman.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.917
Or Freddie Mercury
needed his Brian May.

41:25.961 --> 41:28.703
Are you saying
that I complete you?

41:29.748 --> 41:32.490
Professionally, yes.

41:34.535 --> 41:37.669
Well, then...

41:37.712 --> 41:40.410
you might be glad to know
that after much deliberation,

41:40.454 --> 41:43.457
I have decided
to accept your offer.

41:46.416 --> 41:47.548
Really?

41:47.592 --> 41:49.550
Yes.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.552
I will be your partner.

41:53.554 --> 41:55.513
Uh, that is amazing.

41:55.556 --> 41:58.385
I'm genuinely surprised.

41:58.428 --> 42:01.736
S-So what did it?
What did I say?

42:01.780 --> 42:04.652
Well, although you cited
several excellent reasons...

42:04.696 --> 42:06.088
I mean, the weather,

42:06.132 --> 42:08.134
the chance for me to
continue to use my skills

42:08.177 --> 42:10.397
to help those who
need it the most...

42:10.440 --> 42:14.053
Honestly, it wasn't anything
that you said or did.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.446
I just decided

42:16.490 --> 42:19.493
that I didn't want to go
back to London because...

42:23.062 --> 42:25.847
I found something here
that I don't want to lose.

42:29.634 --> 42:30.983
But...

42:31.026 --> 42:34.769
if I am to remain in Hawaii,
continue solving

42:34.813 --> 42:36.878
all of your cases for you,
then I think it's only fair

42:36.902 --> 42:38.782
that I should receive
some kind of compensation.

42:38.817 --> 42:42.385
And let me just be clear,
that I will not be prepared

42:42.429 --> 42:44.953
to accept, under any
circumstances, chickens, pigs,

42:44.997 --> 42:46.476
boars, barbecues
or anything else

42:46.520 --> 42:48.087
that isn't considered
legal tender.

42:50.132 --> 42:54.528
Fair enough... partner.

42:56.225 --> 42:58.227
Partner.
