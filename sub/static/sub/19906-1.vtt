00:19.253 --> 00:22.688
   ( coffee machine beeping )

00:30.231 --> 00:31.296
         Good morning.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.664
            Oh, mom.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.233
   Why do you always do that?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.368
       Because it works.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.870
       Come on, sweetie.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.672
    Soccer uniform's packed,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.674
       throw your cleats
        in for carpool.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.909
              Mom.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.544
 The early bird gets the worm.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.178
       ( alarm goes off )

00:46.213 --> 00:48.981
   What about the early worm?

00:49.016 --> 00:50.349
         He gets eaten.

00:51.886 --> 00:52.951
          Time to go.

00:52.987 --> 00:55.087
  But they're in the dragon's
    lair, Thorson and Krata.

00:55.122 --> 00:55.621
        Arthur, come on.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.056
      Bowl, plate, shoes.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.358
  I've got that faculty thing
         this morning.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.427
  I could just walk to school.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.028
    We've talked about that.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.063
          Now come on.

01:04.098 --> 01:04.863
      The evil wizard is-

01:04.899 --> 01:06.165
    Will be me if you don't-

01:06.200 --> 01:09.668
      March, march, march.
            I know.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.070
   You should read this book.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.738
     I think you'd like it.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.907
            A comic?

01:14.942 --> 01:16.875
         Graphic novel.

01:16.911 --> 01:21.413
     The teens in this book
   get to do a lot of things.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.616
   Maybe even walk to school
         on their own.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.251
           Let's go.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.524
      I know 13 is the age
    they start to pull away,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.460
 I just... I want to make sure
         he's doing it

01:34.495 --> 01:37.796
      for developmentally
      appropriate reasons.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.898
     Not because he doesn't
            like me.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.233
     Who wouldn't like you?

01:41.268 --> 01:42.568
       Maybe I'm uncool.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.135
        You're his mom.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.571
    Of course you're uncool.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.739
     Maybe you could loosen
      the reins a little.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.208
        What's the worst
       that could happen?

01:49.243 --> 01:50.008
      I teach probability.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.311
         I know exactly
       what could happen.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.378
   Let's turn your brain off.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.547
      Have a girl's night.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.584
       Joe is away at his
  college reunion on the 28th.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.486
      The 28th is the big
         school dance.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.553
   I signed up to chaperone.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.255
         So un-sign up.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.790
     Ok, how about tonight?

02:04.825 --> 02:05.691
      Meet me at the gym,
      we'll grab a drink,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.626
   there's some new cute guys
          at my gym...

02:07.661 --> 02:08.393
        You're married.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.360
          You're not!

02:10.564 --> 02:13.298
  How many years since you've
  been on more than one date?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.234
   You remember how horrible
       those dates were.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.236
  Which doesn't mean that you
 have to swear off completely.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.003
         Take a chance.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.404
      Anyway, tonight is-

02:19.440 --> 02:20.539
         Fajita Friday?

02:22.676 --> 02:23.842
     Am I that predictable?

02:23.878 --> 02:26.245
 You're the one with the lesson
   plans all the way to 2047.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.779
              No.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.847
             2045.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.115
           ( laughs )

02:30.151 --> 02:31.316
   That's the year I retire.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.384
        It makes sense.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.486
 What did you guys decide to do
       for spring break?

02:34.522 --> 02:38.590
     I want to do something
   to reconnect us, you know?

02:38.626 --> 02:40.159
    Just get him to look up
            and out.

02:40.194 --> 02:40.826
            Unplug.

02:40.861 --> 02:41.593
            Exactly.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.461
             Yeah.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.929
            Unplug.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.266
           Gotta go.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.201
         ( bell rings )

02:49.236 --> 02:50.836
          Predictable.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.173
        I rolled a five.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.375
 There was a one in six chance
       of that happening

02:56.410 --> 02:58.610
        because there's
       six numbers total.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.479
     Now what do you think
        the chances are

03:00.514 --> 03:03.382
     that any of you might
       roll another five?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.183
             Adam.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.050
          One in five?

03:05.085 --> 03:06.885
      Close but not quite.

03:06.921 --> 03:07.519
            Tabitha.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.554
          One in six?

03:08.589 --> 03:09.655
         That's right.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.024
  Every time you roll the dice
     the odds are the same.

03:12.059 --> 03:15.327
 You get a fresh chance to get
         what you want.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.362
     Now over spring break
    I want you all to create

03:17.398 --> 03:20.899
your own real world math problem
around the idea of probability.

03:20.935 --> 03:21.867
          Be creative.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.702
     Your problem could be
      about matching socks

03:23.737 --> 03:24.903
 or the upcoming school dance-

03:24.939 --> 03:27.539
  Like the chances of meeting
  your soulmate at the dance?

03:27.575 --> 03:28.373
          ( laughing )

03:28.409 --> 03:30.375
        I'm not sure how
      you'd measure that,

03:30.411 --> 03:33.345
    but if there's a formula
         I'm all ears.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.686
         ( bell rings )

03:40.721 --> 03:42.821
        Have a wonderful
       rest of your day.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.523
        Pi Day, that is.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.424
          March 14th.

03:45.459 --> 03:52.497
   3.14159265358979323846264.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.172
          Hey Tabitha.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.374
Going to the invitational dance?

04:05.746 --> 04:06.945
          Hey Tabitha.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.780
    You going to the dance?

04:08.816 --> 04:10.549
      Arthur, your cleats.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.518
     How are you gonna play
         without these?

04:13.554 --> 04:16.188
       Oh, Tabitha, hey.

04:16.223 --> 04:16.887
      Do you know Arthur?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.724
          He's my son.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.791
              Hi.

04:19.827 --> 04:20.959
       Nice meeting you.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.861
   She is so nice and smart.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.763
       You should ask her
         to the dance.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.064
              Huh?

04:27.835 --> 04:29.368
     See you after soccer.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.105
        Family bonding.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.541
            Too far.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.910
         Too expensive.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.711
         Too dangerous.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.813
         ( door opens )

04:41.849 --> 04:42.948
           Too weird.

04:42.983 --> 04:43.615
        ( door closes )

04:43.651 --> 04:44.750
            Hi mom.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.418
              Hey.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.219
          How was it?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.620
    Did you score any goals?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.656
        I'm a defender.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.490
             Yeah.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.158
      You want some water?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.593
              Ok.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.728
 Defenders score goals, right?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.965
     Yeah. No one can score
     from the bench though.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.568
             Right.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.003
         Well, how was
      the rest of school?

05:05.039 --> 05:07.472
   Before or after my mother
         humiliated me

05:07.508 --> 05:09.341
      in front of Tabitha?

05:09.376 --> 05:11.076
         Oh, Arthur...

05:12.713 --> 05:13.612
           I'm sorry.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.947
       But I have an idea
     to make it up to you.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.417
 I was thinking that for break
   we could do something fun,

05:18.452 --> 05:19.418
           you know?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.320
 Like go hiking or a road trip
         or something.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.021
    Do you wanna brainstorm?

05:23.057 --> 05:25.023
   Can I just play my guitar?

05:25.059 --> 05:25.724
             Yeah.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.326
 Yeah, I'll get dinner started.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.660
  Maybe we could do it after.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.761
              Ok.

05:29.797 --> 05:30.595
         Fajita Friday?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.064
          You know it.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.896
        Family camping.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.565
              Hmm.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.999
             Bingo.

06:22.082 --> 06:22.981
       Don't touch that.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.317
           Excuse me?

06:27.221 --> 06:28.720
   Why would I wait for you?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.355
       I'll show you how
        to use it later.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.324
       I think I know how
           to use it.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.226
         After school?

06:34.261 --> 06:35.060
     Oh, no, that's right.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.863
     You're off next week,
          aren't you?

06:37.898 --> 06:38.797
            Ok, pal.

06:38.832 --> 06:39.898
   I don't know how you know
         I'm a teacher-

06:39.933 --> 06:40.799
          I love you.

06:42.636 --> 06:43.769
              Hey.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.871
         Good morning.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.040
 Oh, u weren't talking to me
           just then.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.009
               I-

06:51.044 --> 06:52.744
         No, professor.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.813
           Professor?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.882
       Wait, so you heard
       everything I said

06:56.917 --> 06:59.684
 and you just let me ramble on
   and make a fool of myself?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.219
      I held up a finger.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.724
              Hey.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.560
 Uh, the door sticks sometimes.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.164
  Oh, you work here don't you?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.231
            Guilty.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.500
You know that's no way to treat
       a customer, right?

07:15.536 --> 07:18.537
 In fact, I would like to speak
        with your boss.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.272
    And what would you like
         to say to him?

07:20.307 --> 07:21.873
              Oh.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.874
        You're the boss.

07:22.910 --> 07:23.842
             Owner.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.245
    I will not be giving you
      a good Yelp review.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.181
       And I'm taking my
      business elsewhere.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.383
         Uh, professor?

07:31.418 --> 07:32.651
             What?

07:36.256 --> 07:37.422
      It's broken anyway.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.537
              Ah.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.371
           I'm home!

07:53.407 --> 07:54.573
         What was that?

07:55.976 --> 07:56.374
          What's that?

07:56.410 --> 07:57.242
         A music card.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.544
       It's yours as soon
       as you're packed.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.246
   We leave bright and early
       tomorrow morning.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.981
          So exciting!

08:03.016 --> 08:04.583
        What's all this?

08:04.618 --> 08:05.784
   It's for the camping trip.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.918
       What camping trip?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.153
      A camping trip, dad?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.421
           Seriously?

08:09.456 --> 08:09.988
           Trust me,
     you're gonna love it.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.156
     You've met me, right?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.357
     Think of it this way:

08:12.392 --> 08:13.758
  it's a great chance for you
  to get far away from school

08:13.794 --> 08:15.126
  and recharge your batteries.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.062
     Bear Creek's not even
         that far away.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.331
  If you would have said Maui
   then I might actually go.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.398
      It's just four days.

08:20.434 --> 08:21.233
          Four days?!

08:21.268 --> 08:22.267
        It's four days.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.101
       In the mountains?

08:23.136 --> 08:25.437
        Four whole days
      at Camp Bear Creek!

08:25.472 --> 08:28.907
    You are aware that it's
    my spring break, right?

08:28.942 --> 08:30.108
      You booked already,
          didn't you?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.343
    It's not really camping,

08:31.378 --> 08:33.611
  camping, which by the way I
 think you would totally love,

08:33.647 --> 08:35.080
  it's camping in a nice tent.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.014
  And there'll be other kids.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.982
     Also roped in by their
       deranged parents?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.986
  If you mean your fun dad who
  thinks of the craziest ideas

08:41.020 --> 08:44.956
  that turn out to be the best
times you've ever had then yes!

08:44.992 --> 08:47.125
   Hiking, canoes, campfires,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.194
   probably be a marshmallow
            or two.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.295
I told you last night at dinner.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.831
     You weren't listening,
           were you?

08:52.866 --> 08:53.965
       And it's my week.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.534
 Your mom's at her conference,

08:55.569 --> 08:57.435
 and what is the good in owning
     your own camping store

08:57.471 --> 08:59.204
      if you can't try out
         the new gear?

08:59.239 --> 09:01.540
   Is that a pink camouflage
         water bottle?

09:01.575 --> 09:03.875
    I know, makes no sense,
             right?

09:03.911 --> 09:05.143
 Look, this place looks great.

09:05.178 --> 09:08.880
 They've got cabins, not tents,
 hot water, tons of activities.

09:08.916 --> 09:09.781
        They've even got

09:09.816 --> 09:11.449
       a glow-in-the-dark
      frisbee golf thing.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.118
   Mom, this isn't like you.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.520
        This is so you.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.856
    Everything last minute,
    and it's all about you.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.824
      Did you even bother
     to ask if I had plans?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.693
            Did you?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.595
       Holly was thinking
      of throwing a party.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.798
          Who's Holly?

09:26.833 --> 09:28.199
              Dad.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.804
     Mom, do you even know
          how to camp?

09:34.575 --> 09:35.440
              No.

09:35.475 --> 09:39.377
      But what better time
       to learn than now?

09:39.413 --> 09:40.078
    ( playing video games )

09:40.113 --> 09:41.880
 We'll figure it out together.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.483
   And you can start by being
   my navigator on the trip.

09:45.519 --> 09:48.853
    You know you have a GPS
     on your phone, right?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.422
 No, I know, but we don't know
     what kind of reception

09:50.457 --> 09:51.823
 we'll get up in the mountains.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.425
   Can I just finish my game?

09:53.460 --> 09:55.160
     You can play your game
           any time.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.261
            Look up.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.495
      It's beautiful here.

09:57.531 --> 10:01.099
  So you're just gonna sit in
the car for the next four days?

10:01.134 --> 10:04.502
Not if I get mom to pick me up.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.371
    Maybe I'll just rule out
   cell phone usage entirely

10:06.406 --> 10:07.305
       while we're gone.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.474
      Then you wouldn't be
      Fun Dad, would you?

10:11.478 --> 10:14.012
You know, I actually printed out
      a list of activities

10:14.047 --> 10:16.581
        so we don't miss
     any of the good ones.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.882
           Let's see.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.251
  Archery, arts and crafts...

10:20.287 --> 10:24.122
 oh, what about the rock wall?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.858
 Did you notice that they have
         a talent show?

10:26.893 --> 10:29.561
     Is that why you had me
        bring my guitar?

10:29.596 --> 10:30.829
            Well, I-

10:30.864 --> 10:32.664
 Mom, you know I don't like to
 play in front of other people.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.439
   ( together ) You gotta be
          kidding me.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.509
   Well, this day just keeps
   getting better and better.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.076
         Oh, I'm sorry.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.278
    Were you talking to me?

11:20.313 --> 11:21.746
            Touché.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.985
         What is this?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.421
  That is my cappuccino maker.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.288
        Propane powered.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.791
     I got it from Miller's
        Sporting Goods.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.659
        I believe that's
       your competition.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.195
  Yeah, I don't sell that frou
   frou camping gear, anyway.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.498
 Then thank you for driving me
   to where I could find it.

11:42.703 --> 11:47.138
  Uh, you don't happen to know
       where check-in is?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.812
           Ah, right.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.314
           Thank you.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.348
            Uh huh.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.249
            Mmmhmm.

12:01.188 --> 12:04.055
        Arthur! Wake up!

12:04.091 --> 12:05.590
          We're here!

12:08.829 --> 12:12.163
 Ok, we've got you in Chipmunk
      which is right here.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.231
              Ok.

12:13.266 --> 12:13.832
        Thank you, Addy.

12:13.867 --> 12:14.999
          No problem.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.503
             Uh oh.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.505
 You're looking a tad confused.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.339
         It's not you.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.007
    This is a confusing map.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.409
   Good, then I'm not crazy.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.410
           ( laughs )

12:25.445 --> 12:26.511
            Beverly.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.846
             Dana.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.348
     I- I wasn't expecting
         so much snow.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.650
        Oh, it's a gift.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.085
      First time camping?

12:34.121 --> 12:36.254
              No.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.922
              Yes.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.391
    Oh, you're one of those
     super in touch people

12:40.427 --> 12:42.427
      who reads everyone?

12:42.462 --> 12:45.730
 Well, the price tags are still
     on your sleeping bag.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.699
            Come on.

12:47.734 --> 12:51.269
This was just a last-minute trip
to spend some time with my son.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.070
             Good.

12:52.105 --> 12:52.771
        We're not really
       connecting lately

12:52.806 --> 12:53.738
          and he wants
        his independence

12:53.774 --> 12:54.706
  so I'm trying not to obsess
         over the fact

12:54.741 --> 12:57.876
      that he's still back
     at the archery range.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.244
      Why am I telling you
          all of this?

12:59.279 --> 13:03.014
      To convince yourself
      it was a good idea?

13:03.049 --> 13:06.384
     I'm not very practiced
         at new things.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.119
 Well, you're here, aren't you?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.220
          Last minute?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.456
      It looks like you're
well-planned and well-organized,

13:11.491 --> 13:15.026
    so now that you're here
         just breathe.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.594
    Oh, you're in Chipmunk.

13:16.630 --> 13:20.131
        Just follow the
       little chipmunks.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.699
              Ok.

13:21.735 --> 13:22.233
           Thank you.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.268
             Great.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.749
       Chipmunk overflow.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.050
              Hmm.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.110
     We can work with this.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.888
    Fine, have it your way.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.161
             Great.

14:23.897 --> 14:24.929
             Great.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.169
     What's with the Jeep?

14:31.204 --> 14:34.205
  Too good to carry your stuff
      like the rest of us?

14:34.241 --> 14:35.807
       Special privilege.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.477
             Great.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.011
     I just found out that
     Holly's party is a go

14:40.046 --> 14:41.379
      for tomorrow night.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.447
             Holly?

14:45.719 --> 14:47.619
        Good one, Steve.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.686
           Way to go.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.023
     <i> ( announcement ) It's</i>
   <i> orientation time, campers.</i>

14:52.058 --> 14:53.992
      <i> At 8pm head on over</i>
        <i> to the fire pit.</i>

14:54.027 --> 14:56.461
     <i> S'mores for the kids,</i>
    <i> wine for the grown ups.</i>

14:56.930 --> 14:57.629
          Can't wait.

14:57.664 --> 14:58.529
          Can't wait.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.208
  Ok everybody, gather 'round.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.878
 Hey, um... you never told me.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.413
        How was archery?

15:15.448 --> 15:16.247
          No big deal.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.183
     An arrow almost hit me
          in the leg.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.018
            Gotcha.

15:22.088 --> 15:22.720
       ( clears throat )

15:22.756 --> 15:23.855
              Ok.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.323
     Good evening, campers.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.591
  Welcome to Camp Bear Creek,

15:26.626 --> 15:27.926
    I'm Addy, the activities
            director

15:27.961 --> 15:29.661
        for those of you
      who haven't met me.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.529
      Now, we have so many
         fun activities

15:31.564 --> 15:32.630
   we want to share with you.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.666
 We know they're gonna bring us
      all closer together,

15:34.701 --> 15:36.734
     but first I would like
          to introduce

15:36.770 --> 15:39.437
one of our long-time instructors
      Ms. Beverly Gowers.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.038
          ( applause )

15:40.073 --> 15:42.774
           Thank you,
           thank you.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.409
    Beverly will be teaching
        arts and crafts

15:44.444 --> 15:46.844
        and also leading
     games and activities.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.946
            Mmmhmm.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.681
  And when I'm not leading you
     on an artistic journey

15:49.716 --> 15:51.783
you can join me at the stables.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.952
      Now, there are a few
         simple rules.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.521
 This area is called Bear Creek
         for a reason.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.356
        There are bears.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.525
  They're actually more afraid
   of us than we are of them.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.060
Hmm. Has anyone asked the bears?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.762
   But if we don't give them
  a reason to come in the camp

16:04.798 --> 16:05.930
          they won't.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.132
   So just make sure you keep
  any food in the bear boxes.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.635
 And Julie thought I was crazy
    for bringing Tupperware.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.303
       And one more thing
     that's very important:

16:12.339 --> 16:16.207
there is a big woods out there,
   so it's easy to get lost.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.744
   So just stay on the trails
 and stay within sight of camp.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.079
         Great advice.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.246
      Oh, I almost forgot.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.881
      One of our campers,
        Steve Reynolds,

16:23.917 --> 16:26.951
 has generously donated a brand
      new canoe for camp.

16:26.987 --> 16:27.819
       Thank you, Steve.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.954
          ( applause )

16:29.990 --> 16:31.923
      Don't forget, at 8pm
  there's s'mores for the kids

16:31.958 --> 16:33.758
    and wine for the adults.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.325
            Or both.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.127
           ( laughs )

16:36.162 --> 16:37.028
       Let's go this way.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.649
       Sneaky way to get
  special parking privileges.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.686
    Hey, you donate a canoe
         you get perks.

17:01.721 --> 17:06.124
           ( laughs )

17:06.159 --> 17:08.259
 Look, why don't we start over?

17:08.294 --> 17:10.161
      We obviously got off
       on the wrong foot,

17:10.195 --> 17:12.030
      which was your fault
          by the way.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.664
            It was.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.799
           I'm sorry.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.069
           I'm Steve.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.539
             Dana.

17:21.574 --> 17:27.211
 I guess I owe you an apology,
 too, for that bad Yelp review.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.815
 I am so sorry, I will take it
  down as soon as I get home.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.984
      I'm not too worried
           about it.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.819
         You should be.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.554
  I mean, there are plenty of
   people who won't set foot

17:36.589 --> 17:37.622
      inside a restaurant

17:37.657 --> 17:40.725
  or a store if it doesn't get
      at least four stars.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.562
    Those people really need
           to relax.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.132
    You- you mean, like me?

17:48.168 --> 17:49.067
  Are you saying I'm uptight?

17:49.102 --> 17:50.535
        No, not at all.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.304
     You seem like you have
      a lot on your mind.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.138
     You know, coming here

17:54.174 --> 17:56.507
        was practically
      spur-of-the-moment.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.709
   That makes me the opposite
          of uptight.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.178
        I'm adventurous.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.213
    So you better look out,
          nature boy.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.318
          ( chuckles )

18:16.663 --> 18:17.462
       What're you doing?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.899
     Oh, I'm making a fire
        from two sticks.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.268
  I read how to do it online.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.136
              Hmm.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.272
            Come on.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.574
            Come on.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.908
     How long have you been
           doing it?

18:30.944 --> 18:33.411
       Uh, I don't know.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.279
     I can't feel my arms.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.684
       Still at it, huh?

18:39.719 --> 18:41.085
      Oh, I'll get there.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.787
       Yeah, you'll see.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.288
      This girl can camp.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.591
  Yeah, no question about it.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.630
  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.298
             What?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.334
    We're not on "Survivor".

18:56.369 --> 18:58.336
     Why didn't you tell me
        you had matches?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.638
  You've got a propane powered
      cappuccino machine.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.006
   I figured you had thought
         of everything.

19:02.041 --> 19:02.673
    You know, you are just-

19:02.709 --> 19:03.241
              Mom!

19:03.276 --> 19:04.509
     Hang on just a minute.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.043
You're one of those know-it-all
 campers who just thinks that-

19:06.079 --> 19:06.611
              Mom!

19:06.646 --> 19:07.545
             What?!

19:07.580 --> 19:08.846
          You did it!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.849
      You started a fire.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.318
           I did it?

19:14.354 --> 19:15.119
           I did it!

19:15.155 --> 19:16.687
              Ha!

19:16.723 --> 19:17.822
    Oh, uh, we have to blow.

19:17.857 --> 19:18.956
           Oh, right.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.427
           High five.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.965
       Pretty great, huh?

19:28.001 --> 19:28.900
            Mmmhmm.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.868
       Best hot dog ever.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.070
         It kind of is.

19:33.106 --> 19:36.340
I might have to get one of these
    fire pits for the house.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.509
       Back yard camping.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.179
   So when's the talent show?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.648
            Really?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.216
You could do that song you were
     practicing last week.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.584
       You know, the one
        with the chords?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.219
   I can get you sheet music
          if you want.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.754
          I meant you.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.223
        You should sing.

19:52.258 --> 19:52.924
              No.

19:52.959 --> 19:53.958
           I mean...

19:53.993 --> 19:58.095
   I wouldn't even have time
      to prepare anything.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.530
         If you say so.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.166
    But you're really good.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.835
 <i> ( announcement ) Hey campers.</i>

20:04.871 --> 20:06.070
   <i> 20 minutes until the kids</i>
         <i> and the adults</i>

20:06.105 --> 20:08.673

20:08.708 --> 20:10.608
     <i> S'mores for the kids.</i>

20:10.643 --> 20:12.577
        I love s'mores.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.512
      I love you s'mores.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.514
          ( giggles )

20:16.549 --> 20:17.848
            Get it?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.217
        Yeah, I get it.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.628
              Hey.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.362
              Hey.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.697
            Cheers.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.834
 You know, there's a few single
     fathers here tonight.

20:38.838 --> 20:39.704
          No, no, no.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.807
   I'm- I'm just here to bond
          with my son.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.543
     You know what I teach
         outside camp?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.577
             Uh-uh.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.112
          Stretching.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.649
      Gary, this is Dana.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.150
          Dana, Gary.

20:53.186 --> 20:54.819
      Gary's from Nevada,
       aren't you, Gary?

20:54.854 --> 20:55.753
             Yeah.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.221
              Hmm.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.891
  You've ever been to Nevada,
             Dana?

21:00.927 --> 21:03.294
        Uh, no, I uh...

21:03.329 --> 21:05.096
   I'm not much of a gambler.

21:05.131 --> 21:05.796
        Oh, me neither.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.565
       Well, not anymore.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.469
           Cool pool.

21:11.504 --> 21:14.305
       I used to have one
         just like it.

21:17.543 --> 21:22.046
     Bet ya it takes a lot
    of chlorine to clean it.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.488
           Hey, Lace.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.760
    How was the kid's thing?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.361
              Mmm.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.863
       You stay out long?

21:38.898 --> 21:41.365
              Mmm.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.601
             Lace.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.037
       I'm going to bed.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.940
       Tomorrow we can do
        some fun things.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.409
           Yeah, ok.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.132
            Hi mom.

22:15.168 --> 22:15.900
          Oh, hi, hey!

22:15.935 --> 22:17.468
        Hey, how was it?

22:17.503 --> 22:18.569
      It was pretty good.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.871
We played that glow-in-the-dark
      frisbee golf thing.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.173
          It was fun?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.040
       You're having fun?

22:23.076 --> 22:25.576
       Yeah, it's great.

22:25.611 --> 22:26.977
            Really?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.179
  You'd tell me if it wasn't?

22:28.214 --> 22:29.814
              No.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.615
          Smart mouth.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.217
       I really wanna try
         the rock wall.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.054
       Um, if it fits in
         the schedule.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.155
      Go brush your teeth.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.657
       Come on, bed time.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.079
      ( rustling noises )

23:13.826 --> 23:15.092
          ( clanging )

23:15.128 --> 23:16.360
           ( gasps )

23:16.396 --> 23:16.927
            Arthur!

23:16.963 --> 23:17.762
            Arthur!

23:17.797 --> 23:18.062
            Arthur!

23:18.097 --> 23:18.929
             What?

23:18.965 --> 23:19.463
             Bear.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.131
             Bear.

23:20.166 --> 23:20.865
             Bear?

23:20.900 --> 23:21.999
             Bear?

23:26.172 --> 23:26.637
            Oh, hi!

23:26.672 --> 23:27.571
       Sorry, excuse me.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.439
            Wake up.

23:28.474 --> 23:28.973
        There's a bear.

23:29.008 --> 23:29.707
            A bear?!

23:29.742 --> 23:30.241
             Yeah.

23:30.276 --> 23:30.541
      Did you see a bear?

23:30.576 --> 23:31.242
             Yeah.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.076
             What?!

23:32.111 --> 23:33.544
          Oh, come on.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.146
      I am so telling mom
          about this.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.081
 I don't think you can blame me
  for a bear coming into camp.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.315
      Well, we're camping
        with the bears.

23:38.351 --> 23:39.450
Bears don't just come into camp!

23:39.485 --> 23:40.918
       It's in our tent!

23:42.655 --> 23:44.588
     Why is he in our tent?

23:44.624 --> 23:46.624
     Did you leave food out
         in your tent?

23:46.659 --> 23:48.893
  In Tupperware like the arts
     and crafts lady said.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.161
       You left your food
         in Tupperware?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.495
    Didn't you hear her say
       that all leftovers

23:51.531 --> 23:54.598
    and food have to be put
       in the bear boxes?

23:54.634 --> 23:56.167
That's not a brand of container?

23:56.202 --> 23:58.469
     Nope. It's those black
       steel storage bins

23:58.504 --> 24:00.004
  that say "bear box" on them

24:00.039 --> 24:01.238
        that keep bears
      from sniffing around

24:01.274 --> 24:02.840
        looking for food
       in people's tents.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.341
           Oh, those.

24:04.377 --> 24:06.110
   Well, that could have been
  clearer in the presentation!

24:06.145 --> 24:08.446
       We have got to get
       rid of this bear.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.347
       What're you doing?

24:10.383 --> 24:12.249
   Getting things that we can
         bang together.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.150
           Take that.

24:13.186 --> 24:14.985
       Make as much noise
      as we possibly can,

24:15.021 --> 24:17.154
that should scare away the bear.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.155
         I wanna help.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.191
    Arthur, you're not going
     anywhere near a bear.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.125
        None of you are.

24:21.160 --> 24:21.792
   You're gonna make as much
        noise as you can

24:21.828 --> 24:23.828
  right here inside the tent.

24:23.863 --> 24:24.595
              Ok.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.796
      Ok, close the flaps
           behind me.

24:25.832 --> 24:26.797
        Wait, but dad...

24:27.834 --> 24:29.099
            It's ok.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.468
          I got this.

24:33.306 --> 24:33.838
             Ready?

24:33.873 --> 24:34.405
             Yeah.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.206
     On the count of three.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.941
        One, two, three.

24:36.976 --> 24:45.182
    ( clanging and yelling )

24:45.218 --> 24:47.651
       Ok, come on bear.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.520
         Go, bear! Go!

24:51.991 --> 24:52.990
          Go, go, go!

24:54.894 --> 24:57.361
      ( raccoon titters )

24:59.198 --> 25:00.164
             Steve!

25:02.368 --> 25:03.200
           It's gone.

25:03.236 --> 25:04.902
       Did you see it go?

25:04.937 --> 25:05.803
         It was just a-

25:05.838 --> 25:07.471
       Your dad saved us!

25:09.442 --> 25:12.009
         It was so big!

25:12.044 --> 25:16.146
         It was really,
     really big and scary.

25:16.182 --> 25:16.780
              Wow.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.984
   That's so cool you did it.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.919
            So cool.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.221
         That's my dad.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.726
   Alright, let's get inside.

25:28.761 --> 25:29.894
            Come on.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.033
        ( owl hooting )

25:40.973 --> 25:45.543
    I'm not usually a rescue
    the damsel kinda woman.

25:45.578 --> 25:48.178
       You seem like you
      can handle yourself.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.513
       It's a compliment.

25:49.549 --> 25:50.881
              Oh.

25:58.624 --> 26:01.292
     Lacey's changed a lot
         the last year.

26:01.327 --> 26:05.396
    I mean, with the divorce
   and starting high school.

26:05.431 --> 26:09.133
   What's more is she's smart
  but she's really pulled back

26:09.168 --> 26:12.536
  from working hard and she'd
       rather be texting,

26:12.572 --> 26:14.104
        and these girls,
       and I don't know,

26:14.140 --> 26:17.441
       talking about boys
          and clothes.

26:17.476 --> 26:18.909
 So you thought you'd bring her
     some place where there

26:18.945 --> 26:23.747
    was spotty cell service
  and make-up wouldn't matter?

26:23.783 --> 26:26.317
              Yes.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.918
She'll come out the other side.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.587
      A work in progress.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.255
       I teach teenagers.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.156
           I get it.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.290
       What do you teach?

26:33.326 --> 26:34.625
       Eighth grade math.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.827
     Oh, now that is brave.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.729
           ( laughs )

26:38.764 --> 26:41.765
     Hey, at least you like
         the outdoors.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.001
   I thought... I don't know.

26:44.036 --> 26:48.572
  I thought coming here might
   boost Arthur's confidence.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.642
          Connect us.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.745
   But I don't know anything
         about camping.

26:54.780 --> 26:58.148
 All I've done so far is bring
       a bear into camp.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.817
     That was just day one.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.453
 Wait 'til you see what happens
          on day two.

27:02.488 --> 27:03.420
           Two bears?

27:03.456 --> 27:05.155
           ( laughs )

27:09.829 --> 27:15.132
   Um, well I should probably
        get some sleep.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.601
       I'll stand watch.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.203
         Thanks again.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.605
              Ok.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.140
           Goodnight.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.816
  So can you come pick me up?

27:32.852 --> 27:35.452
   Well, I wanna go hang out
  with Holly and her friends.

27:37.723 --> 27:40.224
      You uh, think about
       high school much?

27:40.259 --> 27:41.659
 Most of my friends are going.

27:41.694 --> 27:42.960
      You won't be there.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.862
       What could be bad?

27:44.897 --> 27:46.063
           Hilarious.

27:46.098 --> 27:49.500
  So I looked at the schedule
  you put together for today.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.501
            Mmmhmm?

27:50.536 --> 27:52.036
      Tree identification?

27:52.071 --> 27:53.103
             Yeah.

27:54.607 --> 27:55.773
              No?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.642
Uh, we could do arts and crafts.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.313
 Or you wanna try yoga with me?

28:05.284 --> 28:08.986
  Ok, what do you want to do?

28:09.021 --> 28:11.021
     Besides the rock wall.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.256
What's wrong with the rock wall?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.123
  You mean, other than falling

28:13.159 --> 28:14.892
    and breaking every bone
         in your body?

28:14.927 --> 28:16.593
       No, little kids go
         rock climbing.

28:16.629 --> 28:17.995
       Instructors attach
         you to ropes.

28:18.030 --> 28:18.996
           It's fine.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.698
 So not like that time you fell
        out of the tree?

28:20.733 --> 28:21.465
          I was four.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.267
          And your arm
       didn't set right.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.735
         It's fine now.

28:24.770 --> 28:25.869
              See?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.642
     Is there anything else
        you'd wanna do?

28:32.878 --> 28:35.412
    Food tastes pretty good
     in the open air, huh?

28:35.448 --> 28:36.980
             Sure.

28:39.452 --> 28:42.052
    Did you um, take a look
      at those activities?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.221
There's lots of fun things to do
         on that list.

28:44.256 --> 28:44.888
           Fun, fun.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.924
  That's what we're here for.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.393
      Isn't there anything
   that you're interested in?

28:49.428 --> 28:52.029
    Well, is there anything
  that I can use my phone for?

28:52.064 --> 28:52.696
            Lace...

28:53.999 --> 28:55.966
       Wait, wait, wait.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.401
       Yeah, geocaching.

28:57.436 --> 28:58.769
    We could go geocaching.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.471
       What's geocaching?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.106
 It's like a hunt in the woods.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.607
 Your GPS gives you coordinates

29:03.642 --> 29:06.276
  and the coordinates lead you
       to a treasure box.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.244
      What's the treasure?

29:07.279 --> 29:08.078
       Well, it depends.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.113
    Nothing, like, valuable
          or anything

29:09.148 --> 29:10.314
     but maybe meaningful.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.415
         The thing is,

29:11.450 --> 29:12.049
 if you take something you have
      to leave something.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.817
   Ok, what should we leave?

29:13.853 --> 29:15.385
      I'll figure it out.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.720
 Do we need to bring anything?

29:16.756 --> 29:19.056
       No, just my phone
     and two water bottles.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.324
       One of them pink.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.625
           You game?

29:23.195 --> 29:25.229
 A treasure hunt in the woods.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.930
              Hmm.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.465
           I'm game.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.437
        Ah, great minds.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.105
            Oh, hi.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.807
      Uh, can we join you?

29:36.842 --> 29:39.109
          Yeah, sure.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.177
             Great.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.211
    <i> ( Arthur ): My phone has</i>
        <i> a better signal.</i>

29:41.247 --> 29:42.980
    <i> ( Lacie ): My phone has</i>
          <i> more charge.</i>

29:43.015 --> 29:45.516
Finally, a use for those phones.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.084
             Yeah.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.619
    It is so beautiful here.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.187
      You guys, come look!

29:50.222 --> 29:51.321
       There's a bridge!

29:51.357 --> 29:52.656
          Uh, that's-
      that's off the path.

29:52.691 --> 29:53.457
 They said we were supposed to-

29:53.492 --> 29:55.325
        There's a trail
       on the other side.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.227
      And there's a cache
         in the woods.

29:58.731 --> 30:00.497
          Let's do it.

30:00.533 --> 30:01.799
              Mom?

30:01.834 --> 30:04.601
Well... if Steve thinks it's ok.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.504
           ( laughs )

30:22.254 --> 30:24.555
           This way!

30:24.590 --> 30:25.722
    It's really coming down.

30:25.758 --> 30:26.957
       Let's take cover.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.626
             Whew.

30:29.662 --> 30:30.861
     It's coming down, huh?

30:30.896 --> 30:31.728
             Yeah.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.163
   Oh my gosh, it's pouring.

30:33.199 --> 30:33.730
          ( laughing )

30:33.766 --> 30:35.632
     We should be ok here.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.201
          ( laughing )

30:37.236 --> 30:38.635
     It's so wet out here.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.870
             It is.

30:39.905 --> 30:42.472
   So what grade are you in?

30:42.508 --> 30:43.507
        I'm a freshman.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.341
        At which school?

30:44.376 --> 30:45.375
           Jefferson.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.010
Arthur's going there next year.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.712
      How do you like it?

30:49.748 --> 30:51.415
    First time camping, huh?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.816
   What do you think so far?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.353
         It's alright.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.688
        Play any sports?

30:57.723 --> 30:59.923
   Yeah, I play a little bit
           of soccer.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.992
   I'm pretty good at Madden
          on the Xbox.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.427
           ( laughs )

31:03.462 --> 31:05.829
   Why would anybody do math
          on purpose?

31:05.865 --> 31:07.164
    Isn't it just for nerds?

31:07.199 --> 31:07.998
           ( laughs )

31:08.033 --> 31:08.999
              No.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.835
    It's for people who want
    to challenge themselves.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.270
     Find out what they're
            made of.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.104
        But what if you
       challenge yourself

31:14.139 --> 31:15.839
      and you still don't
         get anywhere?

31:15.875 --> 31:17.841
        That's when you
          double down.

31:17.877 --> 31:18.842
       When you work hard

31:18.878 --> 31:19.977
 and solve something you didn't
        think you could,

31:20.012 --> 31:22.379
    that's when you prove to
yourself that you were stronger

31:22.414 --> 31:24.381
 and smarter than you thought.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.717
 That's what I love about math.

31:26.752 --> 31:30.053
    If that makes me a nerd,
           so be it.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.421
        Rock wall, huh?

31:31.457 --> 31:32.422
             Yeah.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.925
My mom's pretending it won't fit
        in the schedule.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.693
    She just doesn't want me
       to do it, though.

31:36.729 --> 31:37.394
              Ah.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.528
 She probably has her reasons.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.763
 She's worried that I'll fall.

31:39.798 --> 31:40.397
             Yeah.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.431
   That just means she cares.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.534
      Well, she's the one
   that's afraid of heights.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.937
         Well, that is
     altogether different.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.572
   You know, if you ever want
            any help

31:48.607 --> 31:51.708
     or if there's anything
     I can walk you through

31:51.744 --> 31:53.377
       just let me know.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.314
       It's clearing up.

31:57.349 --> 31:57.748
           Let's go.

31:57.783 --> 31:58.548
              Ok.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.984
       You know, algebra
        is my favourite.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.486
What're you guys chatting about?

32:02.521 --> 32:04.288
           Girl talk.

32:12.298 --> 32:16.133
    Guys, we lost the signal
         on our phones.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.134
    We wandered off the path

32:17.169 --> 32:20.304
     and now we don't know
     where the geocache is.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.639
          We're lost?

32:22.675 --> 32:23.740
          We're lost?

32:23.776 --> 32:26.176
   Now this is an adventure.

32:26.211 --> 32:30.814
We- we can't be- I mean, they're
   gonna come find us, right?

32:30.849 --> 32:32.649
Well, we wandered off the path.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.084
 How are they even gonna know?

32:34.119 --> 32:34.818
              Dad?

32:34.853 --> 32:36.286
        Ok, we won't be
        back for dinner,

32:36.322 --> 32:37.955
   someone will come looking
            for us.

32:37.990 --> 32:38.855
           It's fine.

32:38.891 --> 32:40.490
       No, it's not fine.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.192
  I mean, do- do we stay here?

32:42.227 --> 32:43.760
    Do we try to walk back?

32:43.796 --> 32:45.696
     I mean, what if we get
           more lost?

32:45.731 --> 32:46.563
    What if there's a bear?

32:46.598 --> 32:49.099
   Oh my gosh, this can't get
           any worse!

32:55.040 --> 32:57.174
    Mom, the fitness tracker
          on my phone.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.643
    I set it when we crossed
          the bridge.

32:59.678 --> 33:04.481
      We took 3,984 steps.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.615
     That's a lot of steps.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.651
         Ok, let's go.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.354
      ( coyotes howling )

33:10.389 --> 33:11.755
            Quickly.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.657
   Wait, wait, hold on guys,
            hold on.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.859
   I think we're really close
   to the geocache treasure.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.665
   It says that it's right...
   yeah, guys, the geocache!

33:21.700 --> 33:23.300
          We made it!

33:24.603 --> 33:25.635
             Here.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.309
 Oh, there's not much in there.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.745
          What is it?

33:34.780 --> 33:36.046
         Here it is...

33:36.081 --> 33:38.682
           ( laughs )

33:38.717 --> 33:41.318
        How about that.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.020
  Oh, we should sign the log.

33:43.055 --> 33:43.754
             Here.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.589
      Right, here's that.

33:45.624 --> 33:46.423
    What're you gonna write?

33:46.458 --> 33:48.158
     Probably my initials.

33:49.728 --> 33:50.794
            Alright.

33:51.296 --> 33:52.062
    Here, I'll put it back.

33:52.097 --> 33:53.063
            Oh, no.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.399
    We didn't bring anything
    to put back in the box.

33:55.434 --> 33:56.233
          Yeah we did.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.734
       I'll put it away.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.462
       Ok, now can we go?

34:25.496 --> 34:26.129
             Yeah.

34:26.165 --> 34:26.929
           ( laughs )

34:26.965 --> 34:27.563
           Let's go.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.565
            Alright.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.536
 ( together ) One, two, three,
         four, five...

34:32.571 --> 34:34.471
     A lot of steps to go.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.806
  ( together ) Seventy-three,
  seventy-four, seventy-five,

34:36.842 --> 34:39.376
  seventy-six, seventy-seven,
  seventy-eight, seventy-nine,

34:39.411 --> 34:42.145
      eighty, eighty-one,
   eighty-two, eighty-three,

34:42.181 --> 34:46.083
  three thousand nine hundred
        and eighty-four!

34:46.118 --> 34:47.551
      There's the bridge!

34:47.585 --> 34:48.752
          We made it!

34:48.786 --> 34:49.753
            Alright!

34:49.788 --> 34:51.221
         That was fun.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.389
         That was fun.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.958
          Dana, stop.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.095
        Look behind you.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.063
 Please don't say it's a bear.

35:00.099 --> 35:00.897
             Just-

35:00.933 --> 35:02.332
           ( laughs )

35:02.367 --> 35:03.600
           Just look.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.172
         And no bears.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.074
          Or raccoons.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.610
          Ah, listen-

35:13.645 --> 35:16.613
  It's ok, it's ok. I get it.

35:16.648 --> 35:19.683
           I get it.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.051
           Thank you.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.787
         <i> Mom! Come on!</i>

35:23.822 --> 35:25.222
          <i> I'm hungry!</i>

35:32.664 --> 35:36.166
     Push down as the rest
     of your body rises up.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.635
      This is how we build
         our strength.

35:38.670 --> 35:44.141
  We push down so we can soar
         like an eagle.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.912
        Shoulders back.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.348
      Ooh, are you tight.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.618
    It was a bumpy morning.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.354
 That's more than one morning.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.422
Alright, let's go to salutation.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.360
 That's it, buddy. Right there.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.494
    Your foot's solid, yep.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.328
           Now step.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.663
        There, perfect.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.467
   Alright, you're doing it.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.336
      How're you feeling?

36:13.372 --> 36:14.871
             Good.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.041
         Ok, now push.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.643
              Yes!

36:19.678 --> 36:21.711
     You're a natural, bud.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.147
 It's gonna get more technical
            up here.

36:25.884 --> 36:26.850
 Ok, this is getting trickier.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.885
You see right there on that grip
         on your right?

36:28.921 --> 36:30.520
            Uh huh.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.155
         Reach for that
     and pull yourself up.

36:32.191 --> 36:32.856
             Yeah?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.157
 You should be able to get it.

36:35.594 --> 36:36.560
            Almost.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.227
      I don't think I can.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.228
  Oh yeah, sure you can, man.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.497
    Just get your feet, both
    of them, underneath you.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.731
    <i> You need a little chalk.</i>

36:41.767 --> 36:43.166
   <i> Reach your right hand back</i>
      <i> and grab some chalk.</i>

36:43.202 --> 36:44.467
         <i> There you go.</i>

36:45.370 --> 36:46.269
            Arthur.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.504
Bring your left leg up to here.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.505
       Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.573
         Ok now, ready?

36:49.608 --> 36:51.775
   Push off of your left leg
    and you reach for that.

36:51.810 --> 36:52.209
         You got this.

36:52.244 --> 36:52.642
         There you go.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.344
         Look at that!

36:54.379 --> 36:55.579
           Nice job.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.247
       <i> Way to go, Arthur!</i>

37:00.219 --> 37:02.185
 Now, it's ok, don't look down,
            Arthur.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.753
          You're good.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.455
        Don't look down.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.356
          Right there.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.290
             Ready?

37:07.326 --> 37:09.759
           ( gasps )
            Arthur!

37:09.795 --> 37:10.560
        It's ok, buddy.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.761
    It's alright, he's fine.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.963
   The instructor's got him.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.231
       You're good, bud.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.600
   It's ok, I think I'm done.

37:16.635 --> 37:17.534
      No, no, no, no, no.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.868
    We're almost there, bud.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.203
        You're so close.

37:20.239 --> 37:20.904
             Ready?

37:20.939 --> 37:22.205
 Get your feet underneath you.

37:22.241 --> 37:22.939
         There you go.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.374
           And push.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.408
     Oh yeah, you're there.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.443
              Yes!

37:26.478 --> 37:27.811
         ( rings bell )

37:27.846 --> 37:29.913
          ( laughing )

37:29.948 --> 37:31.548
           Good job!

37:31.583 --> 37:32.882
           Nice job.

37:32.918 --> 37:36.186
          ( clapping )

37:37.289 --> 37:38.622
     Oh man, that was hard.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.823
      How do we get down?

37:39.858 --> 37:41.124
           Lean back.

37:43.262 --> 37:43.793
       That's it, buddy.

37:43.829 --> 37:44.194
           That's it.

37:44.229 --> 37:44.628
          That's good.

37:44.663 --> 37:45.061
         Look up a bit.

37:45.097 --> 37:45.462
         There you go.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.896
          Here we go.

37:46.932 --> 37:47.330
           Lean back.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.932
         You got this.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.967
Have a little fun with it, bud.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.238
        Mom, I'm sorry.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.339
    I should have told you.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.774
       You were amazing!

37:57.809 --> 38:00.277
      I... yeah, no, uh...

38:00.312 --> 38:03.113
    I would like to see you
     try it again sometime.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.581
            Really?

38:04.616 --> 38:05.915
             Yeah.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.651
          Thanks mom.

38:07.686 --> 38:08.952
            I will.

38:10.789 --> 38:11.855
 I'll see you back at the tent.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.723
I'm gonna go practice my guitar.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.329
      That was incredible.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.597
       That was so much-

38:20.632 --> 38:22.799
 You dragged my child away from
our tent without my permission?

38:22.834 --> 38:24.501
When I think of what could have
       happened up there?

38:24.536 --> 38:26.536
    Dragged? I didn't drag.

38:26.571 --> 38:27.404
     And nothing happened-

38:27.439 --> 38:29.205
     Were you just thinking
        about yourself?

38:29.241 --> 38:31.107
   How cool you'd be to him?

38:32.678 --> 38:34.644
   That's not what happened.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.353
       ( play

38:43.388 --> 38:45.021
          Don't stop.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.790
       I'm not very good.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.291
   Sounded pretty good to me.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.294
            Thanks.

38:51.330 --> 38:54.130
 So your mom said you're going
    to Jefferson next year.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.165
          I go there.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.900
      But I'm warning you
   I don't talk to freshmen.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.368
     Aren't you a freshman?

38:58.403 --> 38:59.636
Next year, when I'm a sophomore,

38:59.671 --> 39:01.338
I won't be speaking to freshmen.

39:01.373 --> 39:06.242
    But we can hang out now,
    'til this torture ends.

39:06.278 --> 39:08.545
         Keep playing.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.848
       ( playing guitar )

39:11.883 --> 39:19.889
     ( jazz music playing )

39:19.925 --> 39:24.561
          ( applause )

39:24.596 --> 39:25.862
        <i> Wow, wonderful!</i>

39:25.897 --> 39:27.764
       <i> Good job, Nat. Ok.</i>

39:27.799 --> 39:29.132
          <i> Who's next?</i>

39:31.236 --> 39:32.035
         <i> Don't be shy.</i>

39:32.070 --> 39:33.269
        Dad, you should
      do your magic trick.

39:33.305 --> 39:34.371
          No, no, no.

39:34.406 --> 39:35.372
           I can't I-

39:35.407 --> 39:36.339
           My dad can
        do magic tricks!

39:36.375 --> 39:37.107
        No, she's lying.

39:37.142 --> 39:37.907
             Steve?

39:37.943 --> 39:39.109
      Steve, get up here.

39:39.144 --> 39:41.077
       You wanted to come
      to the talent show.

39:41.113 --> 39:41.644
              Ok.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.445
    I don't have any money.

39:42.481 --> 39:48.451
          ( applause )

39:48.487 --> 39:50.253
  Uh, I need, uh, some money.

39:50.288 --> 39:52.555
  Does anybody have a dollar,
           a twenty?

39:52.591 --> 39:54.090
       Oh, this camper's
      gonna produce cash.

39:54.126 --> 39:55.091
        Or one hundred.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.926
            Alright.

39:56.962 --> 39:58.561
         Steve's funny.

39:58.597 --> 39:59.295
           <i> Thank you.</i>

39:59.331 --> 40:01.097
      He's not that funny.

40:01.133 --> 40:06.603
    This twenty dollar bill,
      good shape... ready?

40:07.672 --> 40:08.872
        Well, he's nice.

40:08.907 --> 40:09.973
     When I turn around...

40:10.008 --> 40:11.608
 Like earlier when I asked him
      to go rock climbing.

40:11.643 --> 40:12.308
     One hundred percent...

40:12.344 --> 40:13.243
         You asked him?

40:13.278 --> 40:14.911
             Yeah.

40:14.946 --> 40:15.945
           Stand by.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.247
    I'm just gonna fix this.

40:17.282 --> 40:18.615
       ( clears throat )

40:18.650 --> 40:19.582
            Oh boy.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.786
            Um, ha.

40:22.821 --> 40:27.657
    Uh... this used to kill
          in college.

40:27.692 --> 40:29.225
          ( laughing )

40:29.261 --> 40:31.394
      I seem to have lost
            my edge.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.295
           Thank you.

40:32.330 --> 40:36.766
          ( applause )

40:36.802 --> 40:38.802
   I'll get that back to you.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.003
     Look out David Blaine.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.439
       Great job, Steve.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.607
        Ok, anyone else?

40:44.643 --> 40:46.643
         That was fun.

40:46.678 --> 40:47.744
            Arthur?

40:47.779 --> 40:49.412

40:54.853 --> 40:55.852
          I can sing.

40:55.887 --> 40:56.853
          Dana, yeah!

40:56.888 --> 40:57.987

     pie lovers out there.

     Wow, is anyone else's
          mind blown?

41:59.951 --> 42:01.351
   Because my mind is blown.

42:02.587 --> 42:04.821

42:29.047 --> 42:30.246
           Go Arthur!

42:31.449 --> 42:34.851
  Um, this is a song I've been
  learning the past few weeks

42:34.886 --> 42:36.786
      so I hope you enjoy.

42:36.821 --> 42:38.555
     You got this, sweetie.

42:42.260 --> 42:44.360
      Uh, let me re-start.

42:47.432 --> 42:57.440
       ( playing guitar )

42:57.475 --> 43:10.787
       ( playing guitar )

43:10.822 --> 43:11.721
              Woo!

43:11.756 --> 43:13.423
          ( applause )

43:13.458 --> 43:14.424
           <i> Go Arthur!</i>

43:14.459 --> 43:16.192
              <i> Woo!</i>

43:21.933 --> 43:23.433
       Who knew you were
          so talented?

43:23.468 --> 43:24.601
            You too.

43:24.636 --> 43:25.468
           ( laughs )

43:25.503 --> 43:26.903
     Ah, that's just Lacey,

43:26.938 --> 43:29.105
   she's trying to get at me.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.908
   Can you do a rendition of
   Pythagoras's theorem, too?

43:31.943 --> 43:34.177
      Ooh, don't tempt me.

43:34.212 --> 43:35.778
           ( laughs )

43:35.814 --> 43:37.947
        You are nerdier
        than I thought.

43:37.983 --> 43:40.316
     Oh, I am beyond nerdy.

43:40.352 --> 43:41.985
    And not just about math.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.319
       I love Star Wars.

43:43.355 --> 43:45.955
       I know everything
    about Wookies and Jedis.

43:45.991 --> 43:46.923
              Wow.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.758
      I'm into Star Trek.

43:48.793 --> 43:50.026
       I love Star Trek!

43:50.061 --> 43:51.961
           ( laughs )

43:54.499 --> 43:58.134
     Listen, I... I owe you
          an apology.

43:58.169 --> 43:59.602
           For what?

43:59.638 --> 44:02.105
Arthur told me that he's the one
        who came to you

44:02.140 --> 44:05.141
      about the rock wall.

44:05.176 --> 44:06.643
 I should have asked you first.

44:06.678 --> 44:07.276
           Thank you.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.013
   But I'm officially sorry.

44:10.048 --> 44:12.949
  And I am officially enjoying
      getting to know you.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.352
            Me too.

44:32.270 --> 44:36.339
        Well, goodnight.

44:36.374 --> 44:38.141
        Yeah, goodnight.

44:50.789 --> 44:52.121
    You're such a good boy.

44:54.592 --> 44:55.191
         Is that good?

44:55.226 --> 44:56.993
   That's a beautiful horse.

44:57.028 --> 44:57.660
            Oh, hey.

44:57.696 --> 44:59.595
  I was hoping you'd stop by.

44:59.631 --> 45:01.397
         Grab a brush.

45:05.036 --> 45:05.935
         This is Teddy.

45:05.970 --> 45:08.905
    He's a Norwegian Fjord.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.840
   Horses just give me peace.

45:11.976 --> 45:13.042
     Here, right up there.

45:13.078 --> 45:13.943
         He loves that.

45:13.978 --> 45:15.111
          Right there.

45:15.146 --> 45:16.379
      All down his stripe.

45:16.414 --> 45:17.113
              Oh.

45:17.148 --> 45:18.848
             Good.

45:23.621 --> 45:27.190
      I think Steve tried
          to kiss me.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.591
  Do you want him to kiss you?

45:28.626 --> 45:30.393
       No, of course not.

45:32.097 --> 45:33.262
             Maybe.

45:35.734 --> 45:36.699
              Yes.

45:36.735 --> 45:37.567
          Well, good.

45:37.602 --> 45:39.635
   No, we're total opposites.

45:39.671 --> 45:40.937
          ( chuckles )

45:40.972 --> 45:44.540
        You are the yin
          to his yang.

45:44.576 --> 45:47.944
      But I don't believe
     in opposites attract.

45:47.979 --> 45:51.047
  I mean, you have to have at
  least some common interests.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.014
  Anyway, I'm not even looking
            to date.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.283
      I mean, it is not on
    my timetable right now.

45:54.319 --> 45:57.820
  I didn't know that love paid
    attention to timetables.

45:57.856 --> 45:58.888
         That's funny.

45:58.923 --> 45:59.722
             Love?

45:59.758 --> 46:00.556
     I didn't say anything
          about love.

46:00.592 --> 46:02.325
  I was just talking about a-
            a kiss.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.326
            Mmmhmm.

46:03.361 --> 46:04.627
    That didn't even happen.

46:04.662 --> 46:06.162
  Well then it's a good thing
        it didn't happen

46:06.197 --> 46:08.731
   'cause I'd hate to see how
  worked up you got if it did.

46:16.474 --> 46:18.274
        What's the worst
       that could happen?

46:21.846 --> 46:25.615
     The last time I opened
          myself up...

46:25.650 --> 46:29.585
    it didn't go very well.

46:29.621 --> 46:32.455
      Well, what if you're
     a different person now

46:32.490 --> 46:34.624
      than you were then?

46:34.659 --> 46:38.828
    What if you are stronger
         than you know?

46:58.316 --> 46:59.882
            Come on.

46:59.918 --> 47:00.917
            Come on.

47:03.988 --> 47:06.389
           ( laughs )

47:06.424 --> 47:08.291
              Yes!

47:10.929 --> 47:11.961
          Cappuccino.

47:13.198 --> 47:15.364
              Hi.

47:15.400 --> 47:19.535
    Yeah, it's pretty good.

47:19.571 --> 47:21.137
      You wanna try some?

47:22.907 --> 47:24.207
              Ok.

47:24.242 --> 47:25.808
            Why not?

47:29.781 --> 47:32.315
         It's alright.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.316
         Ok, I'll admit

47:33.351 --> 47:34.984
    that that's a completely
    unnecessary camping tool

47:35.019 --> 47:39.255
   if you'll admit that that
    is better than alright.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.858
     Ok, it's really good.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.125
            Right?!

47:47.265 --> 47:47.897
            Listen-

47:47.932 --> 47:51.534
  Dad, what're we doing today?

47:51.569 --> 47:53.736
     What do you wanna do?

47:53.771 --> 47:55.404
      What do I wanna do?

47:55.440 --> 47:57.373
           Let's go.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.945
       Alright, Fun Dad.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.380
           Let's go.

48:04.415 --> 48:06.849
       Yeah, are you sure
      you want to do this?

48:06.885 --> 48:09.552
  You're not scared, are you?

48:09.587 --> 48:13.522
   No, I'm just not that big
           on horses.

48:13.558 --> 48:14.790
            So yes.

48:14.826 --> 48:17.860
 Not a fearful bone in my body.

48:23.001 --> 48:25.034
          ( neighing )

48:26.504 --> 48:27.937
          There we go.

48:28.773 --> 48:30.373
  So I just grab these, yeah?

48:30.408 --> 48:31.974
           I'm ready.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.576
        Ok, here you go.

48:33.611 --> 48:34.210
              Go.

48:34.245 --> 48:36.045
          Go forward.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.046
          ( chuckles )

48:37.081 --> 48:38.681
           Giddy-up.

48:39.817 --> 48:40.416
       Come on, come on.

48:40.451 --> 48:40.816
      <i> No, no, no, no, no!</i>

48:40.852 --> 48:42.952
            <i> Aaaaaah!</i>

48:44.022 --> 48:46.555
          ( laughing )

49:09.981 --> 49:11.981
    Thank you for doing this
            with me.

49:12.016 --> 49:12.949
             Yeah.

49:14.385 --> 49:15.518
       Oh, I think uh...

49:15.553 --> 49:17.987
       It's ok, I got it.

49:19.891 --> 49:21.324
   Thanks for coming out here
            with me.

49:21.359 --> 49:22.758
           Of course.

49:28.566 --> 49:30.800
    So what's on your mind?

49:32.337 --> 49:35.338
    I guess I just don't see
 how math relates to real life.

49:35.373 --> 49:36.138
   There's this girl, Jenny,

49:36.174 --> 49:38.140
   she says it's gonna matter
            later on

49:38.176 --> 49:39.875
    but I just don't get it.

49:39.911 --> 49:43.646
  You know, doing math is like
going to the gym for your brain.

49:46.084 --> 49:47.883
    By the way, cute shoes.

49:47.919 --> 49:48.985
           Thank you.

49:49.020 --> 49:50.353
     How much did you spend
            on them?

49:50.388 --> 49:51.821
        Is this gonna be
        a math problem?

49:51.856 --> 49:52.888
           How much?

49:52.924 --> 49:54.357
         The were $150.

49:54.392 --> 49:55.558
              Wow.

49:55.593 --> 49:59.195
   That's like $60 more than
twice what I spent on my shoes.

49:59.230 --> 50:00.396
        Fine, I get it.

50:00.431 --> 50:04.500
  You spent $45 because I know
  addition and multiplication.

50:04.535 --> 50:05.568
     No, you solved for x.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.003
        That's algebra.

50:07.038 --> 50:09.972
 If x is the price of my shoes,
         then 2x plus-

50:10.008 --> 50:11.574
      Plus 60 equals 150.

50:11.609 --> 50:12.641
              Yes!

50:12.677 --> 50:16.679
   Lacey, you understand math
    better than you realize.

50:16.714 --> 50:19.348
    Maybe I just don't have
        a great teacher.

50:19.384 --> 50:21.417
             Maybe.

50:21.452 --> 50:24.887
But can I guess something else?

50:27.058 --> 50:29.725
    Maybe you thought smart
   girls wouldn't be popular

50:29.761 --> 50:31.560
 so when you got to high school
      you stopped studying

50:31.596 --> 50:34.663
     as much as you used to
     and six months goes by

50:34.699 --> 50:36.332
      and you get behind.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.201
  Math is cumulative, so now,
even if you wanted to catch up,

50:39.237 --> 50:42.838
    it feels like you can't.

50:42.874 --> 50:44.507
   There's this girl, Holly,

50:44.542 --> 50:46.575
     she says that studying
         is for losers

50:46.611 --> 50:49.045
    but she's kind of like-

50:49.080 --> 50:52.948
But she's friends with everyone
          who matters.

50:52.984 --> 50:55.451
 So because of that you decided
    that it's ok to be less

50:55.486 --> 50:56.685
       than who you are?

50:56.721 --> 50:59.188
 No, I just thought that maybe-

50:59.223 --> 51:01.057
   What if being smart makes
       you more powerful

51:01.092 --> 51:03.292
      and more in control
         of your life?

51:03.327 --> 51:06.095
    What if you are stronger
        than you think?

51:06.130 --> 51:07.396
             And...

51:09.634 --> 51:11.000
              And?

51:12.103 --> 51:15.604
      And you can be smart
          and popular.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.940
    And if this Holly person
       doesn't think so,

51:17.975 --> 51:20.342
     what if she's the one
          losing out?

51:24.482 --> 51:26.449
       Your friend Jenny
      sounds pretty cool.

51:31.989 --> 51:34.290
         Lacey told me
     what you did for her.

51:34.325 --> 51:35.591
             Oh...

51:35.626 --> 51:36.692
           Thank you.

51:36.727 --> 51:39.128
    She just needed someone
  to sort of sit down with her

51:39.163 --> 51:40.429
      and talk it through.

51:40.465 --> 51:42.465
        She's so bright.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.265
            Really.

51:43.301 --> 51:45.234
         Yeah, she is.

51:45.269 --> 51:50.005
  I'm not great at the sitting
          still part.

51:50.041 --> 51:53.509
  Sometimes I worry the reason
Arthur struggled with confidence

51:53.544 --> 51:58.314
       is because of me.

51:58.349 --> 52:01.951
And I worry I'm the reason Lacey
 doesn't try harder at school.

52:05.990 --> 52:08.657
  I think the kids are playing
        Capture The Flag

52:08.693 --> 52:10.526
      during lunch today.

52:10.561 --> 52:14.029
       Arthur was saying
     something about that.

52:14.065 --> 52:16.365
   You wouldn't want to share
           a campfire

52:16.400 --> 52:19.201
 and eat our lunches together,
           would you?

52:19.237 --> 52:20.436
       We have hot dogs.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.004
           Hot dogs!

52:22.039 --> 52:22.838
      Sounds like a plan.

52:22.874 --> 52:23.539
           ( laughs )

52:23.574 --> 52:25.441
 I mean, not like a plan plan,

52:25.476 --> 52:27.943
  but more like a spontaneous
             meal.

52:27.979 --> 52:31.113
         That's exactly
      what I was thinking.

52:32.850 --> 52:33.983
             Cool.

52:34.018 --> 52:34.717
             Great.

52:34.752 --> 52:36.285
         Uh, wanna meet
         in 15 minutes?

52:36.320 --> 52:37.286
       Yeah, sounds good.

52:37.321 --> 52:38.954
              Ok.

52:38.990 --> 52:39.488
It's... I'm gonna go over there.

52:39.524 --> 52:40.222
             Yeah.

52:40.258 --> 52:40.856
              Ok.

52:40.892 --> 52:41.290
              15.

52:41.325 --> 52:42.324
              Ok.

52:43.828 --> 52:44.393
              <i> 15.</i>

52:44.428 --> 52:45.594
             Yeah.

52:46.430 --> 52:47.663
             Jeans.

52:47.698 --> 52:48.898
          Cargo pants.

52:48.933 --> 52:50.566
          Sweatpants.

52:50.601 --> 52:51.500
             Jeans.

52:53.004 --> 52:53.869
             Jeans.

52:55.573 --> 52:57.606
    Ah, I think it's jeans.

53:02.580 --> 53:03.879
              Hey.

53:03.915 --> 53:05.181
             Hello.

53:05.216 --> 53:07.716
     Do you know which tent
       is Steve Reynolds?

53:07.752 --> 53:08.350
          Yeah, yeah.

53:08.386 --> 53:10.519
            He's...

53:10.555 --> 53:12.655
  Hi, I'm Robin. Steve's wife.

53:12.690 --> 53:15.191
            Ex-wife.

53:15.226 --> 53:16.325
     Can't believe I still
        get that wrong.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.226
           I'm Dana.

53:17.261 --> 53:22.698
       Uh, Steve's uh...
      next tent neighbour.

53:22.733 --> 53:23.732
             Robin?

53:26.971 --> 53:27.937
    What're you doing here?

53:27.972 --> 53:29.038
       I thought you had
   your conference in Aspen.

53:29.073 --> 53:32.708
I did, but Lacey kept texting me
      to come pick her up.

53:32.743 --> 53:33.409
    I told you on the phone,

53:33.444 --> 53:35.744
I have everything under control.

53:35.780 --> 53:39.615
   I know you did, and coming
   up here was a great idea.

53:39.650 --> 53:42.284
     By the way, this place
         looks amazing.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.119
   I can't believe you never
        took me up here.

53:44.155 --> 53:48.357
 I mean, I could actually camp
  at a place like this, right?

53:48.392 --> 53:51.260
Look, I'm sorry if I overstepped
         my boundaries,

53:51.295 --> 53:53.128
   but she sounded miserable,

53:53.164 --> 53:56.065
 and this is the first break I
could take from the conference.

53:56.100 --> 53:58.133
              Mom.

53:58.169 --> 54:00.402
          You're here.

54:00.438 --> 54:01.604
       You don't remember
           texting me

54:01.639 --> 54:02.972
       about how horrible
         this place was

54:03.007 --> 54:05.207
          and to come
        and pick you up?

54:05.243 --> 54:06.542
           Oh, right.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.444
             Yeah.

54:08.479 --> 54:12.381
      Um, well this place
      really isn't so bad.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.382
          Sorry, mom.

54:13.417 --> 54:14.650
           It's fine.

54:14.685 --> 54:15.551
  Stick it out with your dad,

54:15.586 --> 54:17.586
      I'll head into town
       and find a hotel.

54:17.622 --> 54:19.788
    But now that you're here
    you should stay with us.

54:19.824 --> 54:21.423
     She can stay with us,
           right dad?

54:21.459 --> 54:22.591
        I mean, we have
          enough room.

54:22.627 --> 54:25.394
  Lacey, it's your dad's time,
            anyway.

54:25.429 --> 54:27.463
        And I don't have
       any camping gear.

54:27.498 --> 54:29.898
      You came all the way
            up here.

54:31.802 --> 54:32.534
         You know what?

54:32.570 --> 54:34.637
          You can bunk
       with me and Lacey.

54:34.672 --> 54:36.472
  Steve can stay with my son.

54:37.642 --> 54:38.173
         I don't know.

54:38.209 --> 54:39.808
     No, no. It's settled.

54:39.844 --> 54:43.646
   Lacey, why don't you help
    your mom with her stuff?

54:43.681 --> 54:44.179
           Thank you.

54:44.215 --> 54:46.081
             Yeah.

54:48.452 --> 54:49.952
             Um...

54:51.956 --> 54:52.855
           thank you.

54:52.890 --> 54:54.690
      I- Steve, I get it.

54:54.725 --> 54:55.658
           It's fine.

54:55.693 --> 54:59.094
  Alright, I'll go get started
        on the hot dogs.

54:59.130 --> 55:00.763
           For five.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.131
           For five.

55:10.308 --> 55:11.674
    I really appreciate you
       doing this, Dana.

55:11.709 --> 55:13.809
      Oh, yeah, it's fine.

55:13.844 --> 55:16.512
      Lovely to have you.

55:16.547 --> 55:17.646
   Look how nice you made it
            in here.

55:17.682 --> 55:19.248
    It's uh, it's so homey.

55:19.283 --> 55:19.815
              Oh.

55:19.850 --> 55:20.749
    You have a great touch.

55:20.785 --> 55:23.652
      Yeah, we just- we...

55:23.688 --> 55:26.021
    Well, I'll um, stay here
            I guess

55:26.057 --> 55:27.856
   while you go do your thing
            and um-

55:27.892 --> 55:29.325
    No, mom, you should come
            with us.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.627
         It'll be fun.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.663
   Well, if- if you're game?

55:34.699 --> 55:35.230
             Game?

55:35.266 --> 55:37.099
    Um, yeah, no, that's me.

55:37.134 --> 55:38.767
       I'm totally game.

55:38.803 --> 55:39.702
             Great.

55:39.737 --> 55:40.302
             Yeah.

55:40.338 --> 55:41.804
          Let's do it.

55:48.145 --> 55:53.549
     Ready... aim... fire.

55:53.584 --> 55:55.150
              Woo!

55:55.186 --> 55:56.518
        Wow, nice shot.

55:56.554 --> 55:57.686
        Beginner's luck.

55:57.722 --> 56:01.123
   Archers, get your arrows.

56:14.839 --> 56:17.806
  And we were stuck at the top
      of the ferris wheel

56:17.842 --> 56:19.508
     and Steve was shaking.

56:19.543 --> 56:20.843
     Ok, I was not shaking.

56:20.878 --> 56:22.711
   You're afraid of heights?

56:22.747 --> 56:24.413
        Dad, is that why
     you don't like horses?

56:24.448 --> 56:26.849
    No, I like horses fine,
      I like heights fine,

56:26.884 --> 56:29.017
 I just don't like high horses.

56:29.053 --> 56:33.956
           ( laughs )

56:35.426 --> 56:37.159
          It's ok mom,
      you're doing great.

56:37.194 --> 56:38.026
            Thanks.

56:38.062 --> 56:38.694
        Go ahead, honey.

56:38.729 --> 56:39.228
              Ok.

56:39.263 --> 56:39.795
             Yeah.

56:39.830 --> 56:41.163
    I'll be at the zip line.

56:41.198 --> 56:42.030
              Ok.

56:42.066 --> 56:42.464
       I don't think that
       actually happened.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.399
         It did happen.

56:43.434 --> 56:45.367
          ( laughing )

56:55.780 --> 56:57.446
        Dana, slow down.

56:57.481 --> 56:58.580
     Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

56:58.616 --> 57:00.516
    No, no, please go back.

57:00.551 --> 57:02.084
        I don't need to.

57:04.422 --> 57:05.888
       You know, you try
      and be spontaneous,

57:05.923 --> 57:07.356
     you try not to plan...

57:10.661 --> 57:13.362
 What're we not talking about?

57:14.165 --> 57:15.798
          ( chuckles )

57:15.833 --> 57:18.567
   So much for our non-date.

57:18.602 --> 57:19.535
             Yeah.

57:19.570 --> 57:23.539
     The ex-wife showing up
      didn't really help.

57:23.574 --> 57:24.873
            Listen.

57:24.909 --> 57:28.577
  Listen, it's not- we're not-

57:28.612 --> 57:32.281
  there's nothing between us.

57:32.316 --> 57:34.650
       There hasn't been
        for a long time.

57:34.685 --> 57:37.286
   Is she good at everything
           she tries?

57:37.321 --> 57:39.354
    It's infuriating, right?

57:43.761 --> 57:47.095
    Why'd you guys break up?

57:47.131 --> 57:51.133
       Well, when you're
     with the right person

57:51.168 --> 57:53.068
   you compliment each other.

57:53.103 --> 57:55.003
     They have some things
         that you need

57:55.039 --> 57:57.773
      and you have things
        that they need.

57:57.808 --> 57:58.640
         It's a match.

57:58.676 --> 57:59.641
            Exactly.

57:59.677 --> 58:02.611
 And I don't think we were ever
         the right fit.

58:04.715 --> 58:06.148
        What about you?

58:08.486 --> 58:10.352
        Arthur's father?

58:10.387 --> 58:15.991
       Um, he and I were
    high school sweethearts.

58:16.026 --> 58:18.494
  Even before Arthur was born
      I think we both knew

58:18.529 --> 58:20.696
    it wasn't going to last.

58:20.731 --> 58:25.434
   We stuck it out for a year
        or two but uh...

58:25.469 --> 58:30.005
 it turns out he wasn't really
      cut out to be a dad.

58:30.040 --> 58:35.177
 He's more of a Christmas card
   and birthday present kind.

58:35.212 --> 58:36.645
      You deserve better.

58:40.518 --> 58:42.284
       I think that's...

58:42.319 --> 58:45.053
 that's why I don't put myself
           out there.

58:45.089 --> 58:49.124
        You know, I want
       to protect Arthur.

58:50.261 --> 58:53.161
     Maybe not just Arthur.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.634
    I- I should go find him.

59:03.073 --> 59:04.006
            Arthur?

59:05.576 --> 59:06.608
            Arthur?

59:13.584 --> 59:14.383
              Hey.

59:14.418 --> 59:15.717
              Hi.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.188
        Mom, are you ok?

59:20.224 --> 59:22.591
        Yeah, I'm fine.

59:22.626 --> 59:23.959
              Ok.

59:27.765 --> 59:31.366
   You know, maybe it's time
 for us to pack up and go home.

59:31.402 --> 59:32.501
           Right now?

59:32.536 --> 59:35.571
But what about the big camp fire
     and all the goodbyes?

59:35.606 --> 59:37.406
      What about all that?

59:37.441 --> 59:40.342
  I thought you didn't really
         wanna be here.

59:40.377 --> 59:41.410
        Well, I didn't.

59:41.445 --> 59:44.079
    But I'm having fun now.

59:44.114 --> 59:45.213
            Really?

59:45.249 --> 59:48.784
 I- I made you camp in the snow
    and do arts and crafts.

59:48.819 --> 59:51.086
    Yeah, but we did lots of
       other cool things.

59:51.121 --> 59:53.055
   And besides, there's still
   some things I'd like to do

59:53.090 --> 59:56.091
         before we go.

59:56.126 --> 59:57.693
            Ok then.

59:58.996 --> 01:00:00.095
          We'll stay.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.430
             Cool.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.742
      Mind if I join you?

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.712
        Oh, um... sure.

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:18.880
    You seemed upset before.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.515
         Oh, I'm fine.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:25.787
 What do you think about Steve?

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:27.155
             Steve?

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.223
              Why?

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:31.627
    I think he likes you and
   I think you like him, too.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:32.561
               I-

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:36.131
     And I think you would
       be good together.

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:38.100
       You don't know me.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.502
       I'm usually right
      about these things.

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:43.572
     About setting up your
  ex-husband with other women?

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:48.910
  About good people who would
       be good together.

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:52.648
  Why are you telling me this?

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:55.317
      I talked with Lacey.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:59.287
 I'm heading back down the hill
  to find a hotel for myself.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.256
     I wanted to thank you
      for your hospitality

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:06.428
    and I wanted to tell you
     that he's a great guy

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:08.397
    and I hope you give him
           a chance.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.472
              Mom!

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:19.675
         Come with me.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.776
      Where are we going?

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:21.777
              Up.

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:29.284
      Is this a good idea?

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.053
  There's a grip to your left.

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:33.288
      Grab it and pull up.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:34.356
         Use your legs.

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:36.324
     How do you know this?

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.160
        Steve taught me.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.395
           Now push.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:41.763
           That's it.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.101
           Good job.

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:50.672
       I uh... you know,
   we're getting pretty high.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.175
       Yeah, yeah we are.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.643
      You know, um, I'll-
      I'll just stop here.

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:56.978
    Why don't you go ahead?

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:58.814
              Mom.

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:01.683
 If I can do it you can do it.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:10.992
   Push down so you can soar.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:16.198
     That's it, keep going.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.966
    Remember, use your legs.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:28.877
             Nice.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.011
           Now push.

01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:30.545
             Push.

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:31.713
      You're almost there.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:33.381
         ( rings bell )

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:35.217
             Yeah!

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.284
            Victory!

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.120
            Woo hoo!

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:40.021
              Woo!

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.323
         Good job, mom!

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.232
         <i> Hot chocolate.</i>

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:54.903
              Mmm.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.572
       You were amazing.

01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.407
          Oh, you too.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:02.744
    I never would have done
        that on my own.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:09.317
   Arthur, serious question.

01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:12.721
     Have I held you back?

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:17.726
     Have my fears kept you
     from doing fun things?

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:20.195
      I don't know, maybe.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:23.765
 I don't want you to be afraid
           of things.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:26.067
 I don't want you to be afraid
       of things, either.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:33.508
         It's so good.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:42.117
       ( music playing )

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:44.252
    Hey, what're you doing?

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:47.622
    Oh, um... I was just...

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:50.091
 I was downloading math games.

01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:51.126
       To practice math.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.394
       Well, that's cool.

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:55.630
     Uh, what year are you?

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:57.666
 Ninth at Jefferson in Denver.

01:03:57.701 --> 01:03:59.067
    Tenth at Jefferson, too.

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:00.168
            Really?

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.336
   I've never seen you there.

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:02.771
     I think I've seen you.

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:05.106
       It's Lacey, right?

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.909
   Well, I guess I'll see you
        at the bonfire?

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.578
      Yeah, see you there.

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:20.188
              Hey.

01:04:20.224 --> 01:04:21.556
              Hey.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.693
             Holly?

01:04:24.728 --> 01:04:26.328
            Um, no.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.029
        Jenny, actually.

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:29.664
 I was seeing what she's doing
   at the end of spring break

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.134
     when we get back home.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:39.341
   I saw you left our old key
      in the geocache box.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:42.644
     I think when your mom
          and I split

01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:44.813
   I was so worried about you
           being sad

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:48.516
       that I just pushed
   for everything to be fun.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:50.652
         All the time.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:55.957
   But I think in doing that
    I might have missed out

01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:57.659
    on what you really need.

01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:03.365
    I'm here for you, Lace.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.833
        For any reason.

01:05:04.868 --> 01:05:07.502
          At any time.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:10.572
       If you reach out,
          I'll listen.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.207
           I promise.

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:17.979
         So Maui, huh?

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.181
        You think Maui's
        a better choice?

01:05:20.217 --> 01:05:22.684
You think it'd be a better spot
       for spring break?

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:25.387
       Isn't that, like,
        crazy expensive?

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.922
        Not if you camp
      in the woods there.

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:28.356
       It's pretty good.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.726
           ( laughs )

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.395
          I'm kidding.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.163
     We'll stay in a hotel
         on the beach.

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:36.164
       But you know what?

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:38.199
    I actually really loved
     coming here with you.

01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:39.000
            Really?

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:40.335
            Really.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.007
     Wanna go make s'mores
        at the bonfire?

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:49.778
    Would you mind if I went
          ahead alone?

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:51.546
        No, not at all.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.050
           Thank you.

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:16.271
              Hey.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.873
              Hey.

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:20.875
I spend a lot of time looking up
         at these stars

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:22.978
       when I go camping.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:25.246
     What's your favourite
         constellation?

01:06:25.282 --> 01:06:26.948
          Hmm. Draco.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:30.285
   It's the one that circles
        the North Star.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320
    What're you looking at?

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:34.522
            Oh, wow.

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:41.596
  Listen, I wanted to tell you
     something about Robin.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.264
     Oh, that's ok, really.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:43.898
             It's-

01:06:43.934 --> 01:06:47.502
   She's getting re-married.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.304
    Yeah, she was gonna wait
   to tell me back in Denver

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.640
but she decided to do it today.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.609
              Wow.

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:57.278
  How does that make you feel?

01:06:57.314 --> 01:07:00.849
          Truthfully?

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:02.884
           Liberated.

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:12.093
 I feel really good around you.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.163
            Me too.

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.648
     I made you something.

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:34.616
            You did?

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:39.621
           ( laughs )

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:40.688
        Arts and crafts.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.157
              Yes.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:43.892
           I love it.

01:07:43.927 --> 01:07:44.826
              Awe.

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:49.130
     No one's ever made me
       a bracelet before.

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:51.199
           Thank you.

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:12.387
        So... what now?

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.090
       What do you mean?

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:17.926
       Well, this is our
        last night here,

01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:23.031
        so what happens
     when we go back home?

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:29.104
   Uh, I didn't really think
        that far ahead.

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:30.839
      Is something wrong?

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:42.550
      Dana, I like you...

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:46.054
           But what?

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.292
     You don't wanna be in
     another relationship?

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:55.796
I just wanted to kiss you again
   and see what happens next

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:59.466
    and let that be enough.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.035
        Can we do that?

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.874
       Goodnight, Steve.

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:12.981
              Hey.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:13.747
              Hey.

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:14.582
          Are you ok?

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:16.551
     Oh yeah, never better.

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:18.987
      We got things to do
      before the bonfire.

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:20.121
 Uh, well can I just finish my-

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:21.389
     No, you need to pack.

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:23.291
 We're leaving in the morning.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.359
              Ok.

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:31.466
       Alright everybody,

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:34.569
   come around the fire close
     one last time please.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.470
  Awe, farewells are so hard.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.573
       ( crowd murmurs )

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:42.277
    Another one in the can.

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:44.179
       Let's hold hands.

01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:48.249
 We hope you've had a wonderful
     time full of adventure

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:49.917
        and new friends.

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:53.287
 Take back with you the spirit
  of what you've learned here.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:58.860
   I've seen some great acts
  of bravery, love, kindness.

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:01.596
 Remember these new discoveries
          you've made,

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:04.465
       the new activities
       that you've tried,

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:07.202
       and the new people
        that you've met.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:11.439
Know that nothing will diminish
 the time that we've had here,

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:14.008
  no matter what happens next.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:17.445
   And we wish you all happy
adventures, lasting friendships,

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.014
    and amazing experiences.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.983
     Until we meet again...

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:22.984
        One, two, three!

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:24.219
          ( together )
        Camp Bear Creek!

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.954
              Woo!

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:27.288
        ( crowd cheers )

01:10:27.324 --> 01:10:28.623
      Alright, hug it out.

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:31.059
           Come here.

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:32.527
         I'll miss you.

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:53.915
             Lacey.

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:54.182
              Hey.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:55.450
              Hey.

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:57.185
          What's this?

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.120
 I made it in arts and crafts.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:00.388
  I thought you might like it.

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:03.825
You know, because you left your
other necklace in the geocache.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.026
           Thank you.

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:06.594
             Yeah.

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:07.829
   You better not be crushing
             on me.

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:08.830
              Nah.

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:10.531
There's a girl I like at school.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:11.666
            Tabitha.

01:11:11.701 --> 01:11:14.035
 But I just wanted to give you
     something to thank you

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.703
     for being nice to me.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:18.039
       And also so you'll
          remember me.

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:20.008
  I'll be seeing you at school
       in the fall, dork.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:22.810
     Yeah, but you won't be
         talking to me.

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:25.446
      Give me your phone.

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:28.283
            Um, ok.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:29.517
       What're you doing?

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:32.320
  Giving you my number so when
you get to high school next year

01:11:32.355 --> 01:11:35.390
   I'll let you say hi to me
         once or twice.

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:39.994
    If you promise not to be
         a total geek.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.629
             Deal.

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:42.330
        Come on, Arthur.

01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:43.965
        Time to load up.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.233
              Ok.

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:49.037
    Hey, say hi to Tabitha.

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:51.339
 Girls like guys who have guts.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:52.807
              Ok.

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:58.546
              Hey.

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:01.182
 Thanks for the help with math.

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:02.684
    I really appreciate it.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:04.686
           Any time.

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:06.054
           I mean it.

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:07.555
         If I can help.

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:09.824
           Thank you.

01:12:14.264 --> 01:12:16.998
   So, you like Tabitha, huh?

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:18.199
              Mom.

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:19.167
           All ready?

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:20.468
           Let's go.

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:26.240
          Hey, listen.

01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:26.908
     I was thinking about-

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.543
  It was so nice meeting you.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:29.277
         Yeah, you too.

01:12:29.312 --> 01:12:30.678
             Yeah.

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:31.379
       Listen, I'm sorry-

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:33.214
There's nothing to be sorry for.

01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:34.682
          We had fun.

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:37.919
   But now, back to reality.

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:39.754
        Safe drive back.

01:12:46.129 --> 01:12:47.862
         Yeah, you too.

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:58.272
 Thanks for taking me up here.

01:12:58.308 --> 01:13:02.110
     Maybe we could do this
        again next year?

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:03.077
            Really?

01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:05.279
            Mmmhmm.

01:13:05.315 --> 01:13:06.481
       I would love that.

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:11.919
   And maybe we could invite
Steve and Lacey to join us, too.

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:14.255
             Maybe.

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:23.798
    Then, of course, we have
    to reduce the fraction.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.299
         ( bell rings )

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.871
     Uh, thank you so much,
     I'll see you tomorrow.

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:32.440
   Excuse me, Ms. Henderson?

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:33.708
              Yes.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.910
 Hi. Did you want us to present
 our real world math problems?

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.980
      Oh, uh, you did it?

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:42.517
Chances of meeting my soul mate
         at the dance.

01:13:42.552 --> 01:13:44.185
    You wrote out a formula
           for that?

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.219
            Mmmhmm.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:47.288
   There's number of students
      coming to the dance,

01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:50.992
those coming already coupled up
   versus those coming single

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:54.328
     and random kids coming
    from different schools.

01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:55.696
       That's ambitious.

01:13:55.732 --> 01:13:58.766
   But you might have missed
        a few variables.

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:01.169
     Like kids getting sick
         or something?

01:14:01.204 --> 01:14:05.173
 Well, to start you're assuming
 everyone even has a soul mate

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:08.676
   and that they live within
driving distance of the school.

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:10.711
        The problem is,

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:13.948
 how do you know if you've met
        your soul mate?

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:19.387
 Or what if you thought he was
 the one and he wasn't so sure?

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:22.190
    And there's probably not
      a formula for that.

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:24.192
    Well, each time you roll
            the dice

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:25.726
 the odds are the same, right?

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:27.528
  So every time you just have
         a fresh chance

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:29.163
     to get what you want.

01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:31.399
    And, you know, maybe you
just gotta keep going to dances

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.968
   to make the formula work.

01:14:35.405 --> 01:14:37.438
        Thanks, Jillian.

01:14:56.226 --> 01:14:57.024
      You're not answering
          your texts,

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.559
      you haven't stopped
        by my office...

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:00.361
        I've been busy.

01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:01.295
            Really?

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:03.064
   Rumour has it you haven't
        finished grading

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:04.031
        your papers yet.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.733
    You're the one who said
      it's not a big deal

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:07.168
    if I don't turn them in
            on time.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:08.369
       For everyone else.

01:15:08.404 --> 01:15:11.038
    For you that's serious.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:13.674
 I don't know what's going on.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:17.044
  Did something happen at camp
   you didn't tell me about?

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.113
  The same thing that happens
           every time

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:21.349
    I put myself out there.

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:22.416
      It doesn't work out.

01:15:22.452 --> 01:15:23.384
     So what're you saying?

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:26.687
 That things didn't go the way
          you planned?

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:29.524
       I didn't plan, ok?

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:31.158
     You really liked him.

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:35.830
      I really liked him.

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:42.169
         ( door opens )

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:44.405
       Hey, you're early.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.942
 Yeah, I didn't feel like going
          to the mall.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.443
    How was your math quiz?

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:50.411
          Uh, not bad.

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:52.413
  There was only two questions
         I didn't know.

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:53.414
 I could help you if you like.

01:15:53.449 --> 01:15:55.283
   I might remember something
       from high school.

01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:57.318
    Thanks, but me and Jenny
     are gonna get together

01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:59.253
     before class tomorrow.

01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:00.187
             Jenny.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:02.123
   She's the one that's cool
        with math, yeah?

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.392
    Yeah, she's pretty cool
          all around.

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:05.259
              Ok.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:07.728
    I'm gonna go do homework
         in the office.

01:16:11.968 --> 01:16:13.467
      You should call her.

01:16:14.304 --> 01:16:15.102
             Jenny?

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:17.939
             Dana.

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:19.340
  Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:22.510
    Dad, you're so clueless.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:24.645
     It's not in the cards.

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:26.314
   I already blew my chance.

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:28.983
   Well then you better deal
      yourself a new hand.

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:38.626
    You scored a goal today?

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:41.495
  You were a different player
      out there, sweetie.

01:16:41.531 --> 01:16:43.264
            Thanks.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:44.498
      So Lacey texted me.

01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:47.468
I thought maybe we could invite
           them over.

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:50.638
      That's probably not
         a great idea.

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:52.006
            Why not?

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.808
        You like Steve.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:57.378
    Maybe you guys could go
           on a date.

01:16:57.413 --> 01:17:02.216
   What makes you think that
  I would want to date Steve?

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:05.086
     Because it was obvious
   you two liked each other.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.658
I- I think our time has passed.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:43.157
      ( phone vibrating )

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:43.858
              Hey.

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.326
 They so need to get together.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:46.327
      She won't call him.

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.195
   I know, he's too stubborn
       to call her, too.

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:50.464
      They totally deserve
          each other.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.333
  We need to get them together
           in person.

01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:56.137
           The dance!

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:58.072
  The dance would be a perfect
    place for them to meet.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:17:59.206
       But it's tonight.

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:00.341
   We just have to work fast.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.209
      Get your dad there.

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:13.521
    Oh, don't you look nice.

01:18:13.556 --> 01:18:15.356
      What's the occasion?

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:16.357
           The dance?

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:18.759
      Can I catch a ride?

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.027
           Uh, sure.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:21.429
    I'm not gonna go, but...

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:22.430
              Why?

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:23.698
      You're a chaperone.

01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:27.702
 Well, I was but I thought you
 might like to go to something

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:30.071
  and not have your mom there.

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:33.774
Uh, I- I like having you there.

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:34.942
            You do?

01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:35.943
             Yeah.

01:18:35.978 --> 01:18:39.714
 Having a mom that's a teacher
         is super cool.

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:41.015
              Ok.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:41.949
          If you want.

01:18:41.984 --> 01:18:44.351
I mean, I'm sure they could use
           the help.

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:44.985
             Great.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.554
   Uh, just get changed fast.

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:48.022
          We gotta go.

01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:52.860
        I'm cool again.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.429
       <i> ( ARthur ): Great.</i>
         <i> See you there.</i>

01:18:55.465 --> 01:18:57.264
        Great. My turn.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:57.965
       Hey, dad, can you-

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.567
 Give you a ride to the dance?

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:02.903
        ( jingles keys )

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:05.206
  You're right, I need to talk
            to Dana.

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:07.141
       Ok, let's go home
  because you need to change.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.243
     That's true. Let's go.

01:19:15.518 --> 01:19:17.351
       He's really cute.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:20.087
       ( clears throat )

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:22.957
       Six inches apart,
            you two.

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:24.825
     Hands on hips, please.

01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:25.960
           Thank you.

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:30.898
  Sometimes I wish I was still
       in middle school.

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:33.067
     When love was simple.

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.936
  You obviously don't remember
         middle school.

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.255
    Hey Tabitha. I'm Arthur.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.490
      Arthur, I remember.

01:19:56.526 --> 01:19:59.360
    Um, do you wanna dance?

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:00.594
             Sure.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.846
             Look!

01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:20.681
           Oh, Julie.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:22.783
             Look.

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:26.287
    Our boy's all grown up.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.322
 I even let him walk to school
   a couple times on his own

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:31.625
     since we've been back.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:32.960
            Amazing.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:34.061
          ( giggling )

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:37.798
  Oh, uh, you two, you're not
    supposed to be up there.

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:44.939
    Would you care to dance?

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:48.309
    What're you doing here?

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:51.412
    I came here to see you.

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:53.347
    Steve, I- I- I like you,
          I really do-

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:55.416
Listen, before you tell me that
  I missed my chance with you

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:57.751
just let me say what I came here
            to say.

01:20:57.787 --> 01:21:02.923
    I got this suit pressed
         just for this.

01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:05.926
     You planned something?

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:07.027
              Yes.

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:12.867
What I didn't plan on was having
        these feelings.

01:21:12.902 --> 01:21:15.269
    Ever since we left camp
     you're the only thing

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:18.072
    that I can think about.

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:19.707
  I even ordered some of those
        propane powered

01:21:19.742 --> 01:21:21.242
      cappuccino machines.

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:23.344
       I'm a trendsetter.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.348
  They're selling really well.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:27.948
         Dana, listen.

01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:30.184
         I know that...

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.786
I come across like I don't care

01:21:32.822 --> 01:21:36.590
     but it's just because
       I'm stupid scared,

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:39.026
  and I didn't wanna screw up
      another relationship

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:42.897
  with someone I cared about.

01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:47.234
    The time apart has only
    made things more clear.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:50.971
     You're the one I wanna
     screw things up with.

01:21:51.007 --> 01:21:51.939
             Wait.

01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:54.775
     I wanna try and screw
      things up with you.

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:55.476
           ( laughs )

01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:56.944
 No, it's not coming out right.

01:21:56.979 --> 01:21:57.645
            Steve...

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.947
 I- I wanna roll the dice and-

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:01.582
       And take a chance.

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:02.917
