01:09.702 --> 01:12.002
TOTAL BUMMER, DUDES.

01:12.070 --> 01:14.137
WHAT HAS HAPPENED,
MY TURTLES?

01:14.239 --> 01:15.571
SHREDDER GOT AWAY.

01:15.639 --> 01:16.973
AGAIN.

01:17.008 --> 01:18.307
AND HE WRECKED
TWO GARBAGE TRUCKS

01:18.375 --> 01:20.008
AND US DOING IT.

01:20.075 --> 01:22.177
PERHAPS YOUR STRUGGLE
WITH SHREDDER

01:22.277 --> 01:24.979
IS LIKE THE STRUGGLE
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL--

01:25.047 --> 01:26.613
UNENDING.

01:26.581 --> 01:28.381
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
WE GOTTA KEEP
DOING IT

01:28.449 --> 01:30.015
TILL WE GET IT
RIGHT?

01:30.083 --> 01:31.516
OH, SENSEI,

01:31.585 --> 01:33.685
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
THE WORLD WOULD
BE BETTER OFF

01:33.752 --> 01:36.787
IF WE TURTLES HAD
NEVER BEEN MUTATED.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.856
SUCH THOUGHTS CAN
BE DANGEROUS, DONATELLO.

01:39.924 --> 01:42.391
BUT LOOK AT ALL
THE DESTRUCTION
SHREDDER CAUSES

01:42.458 --> 01:44.525
JUST TRYING TO
GET RID OF US.

01:44.594 --> 01:47.194
DONATELLO'S RIGHT.
IF WE WEREN'T
AROUND,

01:47.261 --> 01:49.730
MAYBE SHREDDER
WOULDN'T BE, EITHER.

01:49.798 --> 01:52.898
BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR,
MY STUDENTS.

01:52.966 --> 01:54.966
YOU JUST MIGHT GET IT.

01:55.068 --> 01:57.169
TUBULOSO CONCEPT.

01:57.237 --> 02:01.738
I'M GOING TO WISH
FOR A DOUBLE DECKER
FUDGE-FILLED PIZZA.

02:10.079 --> 02:12.679
HEY, WHERE'S THE LAIR?

02:12.714 --> 02:16.248
YOU WANNA KEEP IT DOWN
SO A GUY CAN GET SOME SLEEP?

02:28.426 --> 02:29.625
WHERE ARE WE?

02:29.693 --> 02:31.226
AND HOW'D
WE GET HERE?

02:31.261 --> 02:33.528
I DON'T
KNOW, DUDES.

02:33.596 --> 02:35.196
WE'VE GOTTA FIND
THE LAIR.

02:35.263 --> 02:36.530
COME ON, TURTLES.

02:43.003 --> 02:45.370
THIS IS
DEFINITELY NOT
OUR SEWER.

02:45.438 --> 02:48.605
I THINK WE'D
BETTER GO TOPSIDE
AND RECONNOITER.

02:50.274 --> 02:52.207
WHAT IS GOING ON?

02:52.275 --> 02:54.710
NOT A LOT
OF CLEANING,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

02:54.745 --> 02:55.910
WHAT A MESS.

02:55.978 --> 02:57.912
EVERYTHING'S
FALLING APART.

02:57.914 --> 03:02.183
YEAH. KINDA REMINDS ME
OF OUR PLACE AFTER
A PIZZA PARTY.

03:02.217 --> 03:04.851
THIS PLACE HASN'T
BEEN CLEANED
IN YEARS.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.784
AND THEY'VE GOT
AIR TO MATCH.

03:06.852 --> 03:08.953
LOOK AT THE POLLUTION!

03:09.022 --> 03:12.023
<i>ALL MUTANTS ARE
TO BE HUNTED DOWN.</i>

03:12.090 --> 03:14.257
<i>MUTANTS ARE
YOUR ENEMIES.</i>

03:14.325 --> 03:16.758
THE DUDE'S
TALKING
ABOUT US.

03:16.827 --> 03:19.028
AND WE DON'T HAVE
OUR DISGUISES.

03:19.129 --> 03:21.729
NO PROBLEM.
I SEE JUST THE PLACE.

03:21.831 --> 03:23.464
"DAVE'S DISGUISES."

03:23.532 --> 03:24.998
I'D SAY THERE'S
A FAIR CHANCE

03:25.066 --> 03:26.766
WE'LL FIND
A DISGUISE THERE.

03:26.835 --> 03:30.203
EXCELLENT. THEY'VE
GOT EVERYTHING HERE.

03:30.237 --> 03:32.303
WHAT DO
YOU THINK, MATES?

03:32.371 --> 03:33.705
FAIR DINKUM, EH?

03:33.773 --> 03:34.872
FORGET IT.

03:34.939 --> 03:37.707
THIS
IS DEFINITELY
MORE YOU.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.043
HOW MUCH
FOR 4 COSTUMES?

03:40.144 --> 03:42.878
START PAYING.
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN.

03:42.945 --> 03:46.279
HEY, WHAT KIND
OF PHONY MONEY
IS THIS?

03:46.348 --> 03:49.181
MUTANTS! OH, I
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.151
YOUR MONEY'S
AS WORTHLESS
AS YOU ARE.

03:51.218 --> 03:52.618
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

03:52.652 --> 03:53.686
WHAT'S THE MATTER,

03:53.753 --> 03:56.120
YOU FROM DIMENSION X
OR SOMETHING?

03:56.187 --> 03:58.022
THIS HERE IS
THE ONLY MONEY

03:58.090 --> 04:00.690
THAT'S GOOD
IN THIS TOWN.

04:00.758 --> 04:02.592
THAT'S
SHREDDER'S PICTURE.

04:02.694 --> 04:05.327
NATURALLY.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

04:05.395 --> 04:07.896
THIS IS
SHREDDERVILLE.

04:07.997 --> 04:08.964
SHREDDERVILLE?

04:09.031 --> 04:11.798
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF A PRACTICAL JOKE?

04:11.867 --> 04:14.200
IT'S NO JOKE,
MUTANT.

04:14.268 --> 04:17.969
NOW, SCRAM OUTTA HERE,
BEFORE I CALL THE COPS.

04:18.036 --> 04:20.171
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THIS CITY?

04:20.238 --> 04:22.907
THE WHOLE PLACE HAS
CHANGED OVERNIGHT.

04:23.008 --> 04:24.074
LET'S GO FIND APRIL.

04:24.142 --> 04:26.142
MAYBE SHE'S GOT
SOME ANSWERS.

04:27.311 --> 04:28.710
OH, MY GOSH.

04:28.778 --> 04:30.712
LOOK AT
THE CHANNEL 6 BUILDING.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.514
I LOVE WHAT
THEY'VE DONE
WITH THE PLACE.

04:33.582 --> 04:35.916
SCOPE IT OUT, DUDES.

04:36.017 --> 04:39.718
WHOA. LIKE, THE WORLD SURE
IS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE.

04:39.786 --> 04:41.954
I TOLD YOU IT'D
FALL APART ONE DAY.

04:42.089 --> 04:46.790
OH, I'M NOT SO SURE
I WANT TO RIDE
ON THIS ELEVATOR.

04:46.925 --> 04:49.492
YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO.
THERE'S NO CAR.

04:49.561 --> 04:51.327
COWABUNGA!
IT'S COMING!

04:51.395 --> 04:53.162
AND IT'S AN EXPRESS!

04:56.065 --> 04:57.164
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

04:57.231 --> 04:58.966
MAYBE WE OUGHT
TO TAKE THE STAIRS.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.169
HEY, LOOK.

05:04.236 --> 05:07.505
IRMA'S BEEN REPLACED
BY A ROBOT RECEPTIONIST.

05:07.507 --> 05:10.274
MAY I HELP YOU?

05:10.376 --> 05:12.976
SHE OUGHT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE
LOOSE TEETH, HUH?

05:13.077 --> 05:15.778
WE'D LIKE TO SEE
APRIL O'NEIL,
PLEASE.

05:15.879 --> 05:17.680
APRIL...APRIL...

05:17.747 --> 05:19.880
APRIL HAS 30 DAYS.

05:19.948 --> 05:23.183
UNLIKE FEBRUARY,
WHICH HAS 28.

05:28.956 --> 05:31.022
A SIMPLE "I DON'T
KNOW IF SHE'S IN"

05:31.090 --> 05:33.256
WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.

05:33.325 --> 05:36.092
AH, AT LEAST
APRIL'S OFFICE
IS STILL HERE.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.761
I HOPE YOU CAN
HANDLE A FEW
SLIGHT CHANGES.

05:41.297 --> 05:44.432
IT'S RIGHT OUT
OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS.

05:44.499 --> 05:45.666
APRIL?

05:45.734 --> 05:46.767
IRMA?

05:46.835 --> 05:49.769
ARE YOU DUDETTES GOING
TO A COSTUME PARTY?

05:49.837 --> 05:51.703
MUTANTS!

05:51.838 --> 05:53.605
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

05:53.673 --> 05:56.207
GARBAGE PICKUP
ISN'T UNTIL THURSDAY.

05:56.242 --> 05:58.008
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHO WE ARE?

05:58.109 --> 05:59.710
OF COURSE NOT.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.378
WE DON'T SOCIALIZE
WITH MUTANTS.

06:02.513 --> 06:05.013
WE'RE NOT THAT KIND
OF HAREM GIRLS.

06:07.416 --> 06:08.749
LET ME GUESS.

06:08.817 --> 06:12.551
YOU GUYS ARE
THE TOOTH FAIRY,
RIGHT?

06:12.620 --> 06:17.256
NAH, THERE AIN'T
4 TOOTH FAIRIES, STUPID.

06:17.324 --> 06:19.723
THEM'S THE 7 DWARFS.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.525
BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY.

06:21.593 --> 06:22.959
THEY'RE NOT MUTANTS.

06:23.027 --> 06:25.394
AND THEY DON'T
RECOGNIZE US,
EITHER.

06:25.463 --> 06:27.663
DOESN'T ANYBODY
RECOGNIZE US?

06:27.698 --> 06:29.764
OH, WHOEVER YOU
GEEKS ARE,

06:29.832 --> 06:31.432
YOU AIN'T WELCOME.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.268
RIGHT. YOU SCARED AWAY
OUR SERVING GIRLS.

06:35.337 --> 06:36.469
APRIL AND IRMA--

06:36.537 --> 06:39.238
ROCKSTEADY
AND BEBOP'S
SERVING GIRLS?

06:39.240 --> 06:43.008
WHAT A TOTALLY
NUTSOID CONCEPT.

06:43.109 --> 06:47.277
WE HAPPEN TO BE
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES.

06:47.346 --> 06:50.680
TURTLES, HUH?
WE LIKE TURTLES.

06:50.715 --> 06:53.348
AH, WELL,
THAT'S A RELIEF.

06:53.483 --> 06:57.051
YEAH, WE LIKE
YOU FOR LUNCH.

06:59.721 --> 07:01.121
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.287
GET HIM!

07:06.859 --> 07:09.426
LET'S WRAP
THIS UP, AMIGO.

07:10.929 --> 07:14.563
THEY'RE AS SNUG
AS 2 SLUGS IN A RUG.

07:14.631 --> 07:17.498
WHOA, SENDING THE CARPET
OUT FOR CLEANING, I SEE.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.267
IT NEEDS IT.
I GOTTA GET RID

07:19.334 --> 07:20.434
OF THESE 2 BIG
GREASE SPOTS.

07:22.371 --> 07:24.704
I STILL CAN'T
FIGURE OUT THIS PLACE.

07:24.771 --> 07:26.873
IT'S LIKE TOTALLY BIZARRO.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.441
NOBODY KNOWS
WHO WE ARE.

07:29.508 --> 07:30.342
HOLD IT, GUYS.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.243
I JUST
FIGURED IT OUT.

07:32.311 --> 07:35.011
THE REASON NOBODY
KNOWS US IS...

07:35.079 --> 07:36.746
WE GOT OUR WISH.

07:36.814 --> 07:38.113
WHAT WISH?

07:38.181 --> 07:40.716
REMEMBER? LAST NIGHT,
WE THOUGHT THE WORLD

07:40.783 --> 07:43.951
MIGHT BE BETTER OFF
IF WE NEVER EXISTED.

07:44.020 --> 07:46.786
WELL, THIS IS
THE WORLD

07:46.854 --> 07:50.656
WITHOUT THE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.

07:56.694 --> 07:59.795
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE DON'T EXIST?

07:59.863 --> 08:02.432
WE'VE BEEN TRANSPORTED
TO SOME ALTERNATE WORLD.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.099
IT'S JUST LIKE OURS

08:04.167 --> 08:07.001
EXCEPT FOR ONE
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE.

08:07.068 --> 08:07.768
WHAT'S THAT?

08:07.903 --> 08:09.504
WE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES

08:09.571 --> 08:12.171
NEVER LIVED.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.239
WHY ELSE WOULD
OUR BEST FRIENDS

08:13.307 --> 08:15.441
APRIL AND IRMA
RUN AWAY FROM US?

08:15.542 --> 08:17.241
MAYBE IT'S OUR BREATH.

08:18.411 --> 08:20.077
SOMEBODY'S COMING.

08:20.145 --> 08:21.844
I'LL GO
CHECK IT OUT.

08:25.349 --> 08:28.150
LET'S FIX THEM
ROTTEN MUTANTS.

08:28.217 --> 08:31.752
YEAH, MUTANTS
ARE OUR ENEMY.

08:31.819 --> 08:34.020
LET'S LOOK
FOR A WAY OUT.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.822
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY--

08:36.890 --> 08:38.091
WE'LL TAKE
THE TURTLE ELEVATOR.

08:41.294 --> 08:44.193
NOW I KNOW WE'RE NOT
IN OUR WORLD. LOOK.

08:44.261 --> 08:46.395
THE TECHNODROME.

08:46.463 --> 08:47.864
SO THAT'S WHY
THIS WORLD

08:47.932 --> 08:49.631
IS IN SUCH
BAD SHAPE.

08:49.699 --> 08:51.466
I'LL BET KRANG
IS RESPONSIBLE

08:51.534 --> 08:54.368
FOR OUR BEING HERE
IN THIS ALTERNATE WORLD.

08:54.436 --> 08:56.636
WELL, HEY, LET'S GO
FIND THAT TURKEY

08:56.704 --> 08:58.172
AND TALK TURKEY.

08:58.239 --> 08:59.539
MUTANTS, GO HOME!

08:59.607 --> 09:03.342
NO MORE FREAKS
IN OUR FAIR CITY!

09:03.344 --> 09:04.375
I GET THE DISTINCT
FEELING

09:04.443 --> 09:05.977
THEY DON'T LIKE US.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.578
MUTANTS, GO HOME!

09:08.646 --> 09:11.147
I BELIEVE IT'S TIME
FOR A TACTICAL RETREAT.

09:16.919 --> 09:20.520
AH, OK, THEY'RE GONE NOW.

09:20.588 --> 09:22.689
THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE GOING ON HERE.

09:22.756 --> 09:24.824
EVERYBODY HATES MUTANTS.

09:24.892 --> 09:26.358
I DON'T GET IT,
EITHER.

09:26.426 --> 09:28.060
WE'RE SO LOVEABLE.

09:28.128 --> 09:32.529
KRANG HAS REALLY LET
THE TECHNODROME GET RUN DOWN.

09:32.596 --> 09:34.765
DON'T YOU JUST HATE
A SLOPPY HOUSEKEEPER?

09:34.833 --> 09:36.265
HEY, SCOPE IT OUT.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.101
SOME KID'S
SPRAY-PAINTING A MESSAGE.

09:39.169 --> 09:42.003
"KRANG GO HOME."

09:43.638 --> 09:46.373
HEY, LET GO OF ME,
GRAVEL BREATH!

09:46.440 --> 09:47.573
YOU WILL
COME WITH ME.

09:47.641 --> 09:49.275
WHAT FOR?

09:49.343 --> 09:52.710
DEFACING THE TECHNODROME
IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE.

09:52.779 --> 09:54.044
WE CAN'T LET
THAT ROCK SOLDIER

09:54.112 --> 09:56.213
ARREST THAT KID.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.517
GOTCHA, LITTLE DUDE.

10:00.585 --> 10:03.018
AH, GEE,
THANKS, MISTER, I--

10:03.086 --> 10:06.521
A MUTANT?
YUCK! LET GO OF ME.

10:06.589 --> 10:08.622
HEY, YOU'RE ZACH.

10:08.689 --> 10:10.790
<i>HEY, DUDES, IT'S OUR
OLD COMPADRE,</i>

10:10.858 --> 10:12.525
THE FIFTH TURTLE.

10:12.593 --> 10:15.360
YOU MUTANTS
KNOW MY NAME?

10:15.428 --> 10:17.262
WE HAVE A FRIEND
WHO'S JUST LIKE YOU.

10:17.329 --> 10:18.895
UH, WHERE WE
COME FROM.

10:18.963 --> 10:22.465
AROUND HERE, HUMANS
AND MUTANTS AREN'T FRIENDS.

10:22.532 --> 10:25.735
BUT THANKS FOR SAVING ME
FROM THAT ROCK SOLDIER.

10:25.770 --> 10:29.436
THOSE PEBBLEBRAINS
ARE NO FRIENDS
OF OURS, EITHER.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.972
YOU COULD
DO US A FAVOR.

10:31.039 --> 10:33.606
WE NEED TO GET INTO
THE TECHNODROME.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.308
LOOKING LIKE THAT?
HA, FORGET IT.

10:36.376 --> 10:38.810
YOU'D NEVER GET PAST
THAT GENERAL TRAGG.

10:38.878 --> 10:41.078
IT MIGHT HELP
GET RID OF KRANG.

10:41.146 --> 10:43.447
YEAH, AND WE'RE GREAT
WITH DISGUISES.

10:43.515 --> 10:46.683
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SO? COME WITH ME.

10:48.217 --> 10:48.884
HOLD IT.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.952
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

10:51.020 --> 10:53.788
UH, WE GOT
AN EMERGENCY CALL.
SOMETHING NEEDS FIXING.

10:53.856 --> 10:56.656
IN THIS CITY,
EVERYTHING NEEDS FIXING.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.557
THEN WE GOT HERE
JUST IN TIME.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.594
COME ON, FELLOW...
SANITARY ENGINEERS.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.762
NOT SO FAST.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.430
I'LL HAVE TO SEE YOUR I.D.

11:06.497 --> 11:07.898
UH, NO TIME, GENERAL.

11:07.966 --> 11:10.166
THE FRAMISTAM IS LEAKING
INTO THE BEAMERJAM.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.667
OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,
GO AHEAD.

11:12.736 --> 11:15.771
FRAMISTAM LEAKING
INTO THE BEAMERJAM?

11:15.839 --> 11:19.505
YUCK. THIS IS NOT EVEN
A NICE PLACE TO VISIT.

11:19.574 --> 11:23.342
PERSONALLY, IT KINDA
MAKES ME HOMESICK
FOR THE SEWER.

11:23.410 --> 11:27.279
BLAST YOU,
BLASTED THING!

11:27.346 --> 11:30.180
WELL, WELL, IF IT ISN'T
KRANG HIMSELF.

11:30.248 --> 11:34.450
SO YOU'RE FINALLY HERE
TO FIX MY VIEW SCREEN.

11:34.517 --> 11:37.685
NO, WE'RE THE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES,

11:37.753 --> 11:39.754
AND WE'RE HERE
TO FIX YOU.

11:39.856 --> 11:42.689
RIGHT. THIS CITY
IS A TERRIBLE MESS,

11:42.757 --> 11:44.690
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.994
ME? YOU GOT
THAT TREASONOUS
NINJA SHREDDER

11:48.061 --> 11:49.828
TO THANK FOR ALL THIS.

11:49.895 --> 11:50.996
WHY DO YOU THINK

11:51.064 --> 11:53.931
THEY CALL THIS
PLACE SHREDDERVILLE?

11:53.999 --> 11:54.865
OF COURSE.

11:54.933 --> 11:57.000
IT WAS SHREDDER'S VOICE
WE HEARD

11:57.067 --> 11:59.502
ON THOSE ANTIMUTANT
ANNOUNCEMENTS.

11:59.569 --> 12:01.937
DO YOU THINK I'D LET
THE TECHNODROME

12:02.005 --> 12:05.707
GET THIS RUN DOWN
IF I WERE IN CHARGE?

12:05.775 --> 12:07.174
OH, THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

12:07.242 --> 12:10.543
THE POWER GENERATORS
ARE SERIOUSLY OVERHEATING.

12:10.611 --> 12:11.945
WHAT CAN I DO?

12:12.012 --> 12:14.713
SHREDDER IS DIVERTING
ALL THE COOLANTS

12:14.781 --> 12:17.514
FOR HIS OWN USE
AT HIS HEADQUARTERS.

12:17.583 --> 12:18.783
WHERE'S THAT?

12:18.884 --> 12:21.083
AT CHANNEL 6,
WHERE ELSE?

12:21.152 --> 12:23.852
I THINK IT'S
TIME TO GO, DUDES.

12:23.987 --> 12:25.587
WE'LL SEND YOU A BILL
FOR OUR SERVICE.

12:25.655 --> 12:29.323
WAIT. YOU MUST
FIX MY VIEW SCREEN.

12:29.391 --> 12:33.359
MY FAVORITE SOAP COMES ON
IN A FEW MINUTES.

12:33.427 --> 12:35.294
WHAT WILL I DO?

12:35.395 --> 12:36.462
READ A BOOK.

12:36.563 --> 12:40.197
ROCK SOLDIERS!
ROCK SOLDIERS!

12:40.266 --> 12:42.466
THERE'S THE EXIT,
DEAD AHEAD.

12:42.567 --> 12:44.869
COULD YOU PHRASE THAT
ANOTHER WAY?

12:44.870 --> 12:46.902
THERE THEY GO!
STOP THEM!

12:49.705 --> 12:51.873
GET THEM!

12:51.941 --> 12:53.808
LOOK OUT!

13:00.080 --> 13:00.879
THANKS, ZACH.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.114
HEY, I OWED YOU ONE.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.716
WELL, NOW WE'RE EVEN,
MICRODUDE.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.017
I'M GOTTA GO.
SO LONG, TURTLES!

13:08.119 --> 13:11.320
FELLAS, I THINK WE KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

13:11.388 --> 13:13.689
SNACK TIME, HUH?

13:13.790 --> 13:15.824
YEAH. I WISH BEBOP

13:15.891 --> 13:17.925
WOULD LEARN TO PEEL
HIS OWN GRAPES.

13:20.262 --> 13:22.027
AWFUL MUTANT!

13:22.095 --> 13:24.929
I THOUGHT WE TOLD YOU
TO TAKE A HIKE.

13:24.998 --> 13:26.230
LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
YOUR ENEMIES.

13:26.299 --> 13:28.231
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.301
SHREDDER'S BLAMED EVERYTHING
ON THE MUTANTS

13:30.368 --> 13:33.603
SO PEOPLE WON'T FIND OUT
WHO THE REAL ENEMY IS.

13:33.671 --> 13:36.872
THE HONCHO BAD DUDE
AROUND HERE IS SHREDDER.

13:37.007 --> 13:38.340
SHREDDER?!

13:38.441 --> 13:41.676
ALONG WITH HIS 2 MUTANTS
BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.678
MUTANTS? BEBOP
AND ROCKSTEADY?

13:44.712 --> 13:48.547
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
JUST UGLY HUMANS.

13:48.549 --> 13:50.849
WELL, IN OUR WORLD,
THEY'RE MUTANTS.

13:50.950 --> 13:53.083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOUR WORLD?

13:53.152 --> 13:55.919
UH, IT'S
A LONG STORY.

13:55.954 --> 13:57.052
WHILE YOU TELL IT,

13:57.120 --> 13:59.522
RAPHAEL AND I WILL
TRACK DOWN SHREDDER.

13:59.623 --> 14:01.623
GO THAT WAY, YOU TWO.

14:01.691 --> 14:03.658
YOU'VE GOT AUDIENCE
DUTY TODAY.

14:03.793 --> 14:06.027
COME ONE, WE CAN
TAKE THESE GUYS.

14:05.994 --> 14:07.660
FORGET IT! WE DON'T
WANT THE WHOLE PLACE

14:07.728 --> 14:10.230
AFTER US UNTIL
WE FIND SHREDDER.

14:10.364 --> 14:12.897
WHAT IS AUDIENCE DUTY?

14:12.965 --> 14:14.065
HOW'D WE GET ROPED

14:14.133 --> 14:16.000
INTO WATCHING
SOME TV SHOW?

14:16.168 --> 14:18.435
FROM THE LOOKS OF THESE
UNHAPPY FACES,

14:18.502 --> 14:21.438
I'D SAY IT'S NOT
ONE OF YOUR MAJOR HITS.

14:21.472 --> 14:26.140
<i>HEY, GANG, IT'S TIME FOR
THE I LOVE SHREDDER SHOW!</i>

14:29.044 --> 14:32.712
TODAY WE'LL REVIEW OUR
GLORIOUS LEADER'S EARLY YEARS.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.546
ROLL THE TAPE.

14:34.614 --> 14:35.614
EVEN AS A BABY,

14:35.682 --> 14:38.150
SHREDDER WAS DRAWN
TO THE MARTIAL ARTS.

14:38.217 --> 14:39.850
AS HE GREW OLDER,

14:39.917 --> 14:41.785
OUR GENEROUS LEADER
FOUND THE TIME

14:41.853 --> 14:44.721
TO SHARE HIS SKILLS
WITH HIS SCHOOLMATES.

14:44.722 --> 14:47.422
THAT'S IT!
I'M MAD AS HECK,

14:47.490 --> 14:50.457
AND I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE IT ANYMORE!

14:50.526 --> 14:52.660
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT GOOD OLD SHREDDER

14:52.728 --> 14:56.229
IS TO BLAME FOR
THIS MISERABLE CONDITION
THINGS ARE IN.

14:56.264 --> 14:59.264
LISTEN TO ME! SHREDDER
IS YOUR REAL ENEMY!

14:59.332 --> 15:00.432
NOT THE--

15:00.534 --> 15:03.167
MUTANTS! GET THEM!

15:06.571 --> 15:07.938
THANKS, LEONARDO!

15:08.006 --> 15:11.373
<i>NOW I'LL NEVER KNOW HOW
I LOVE SHREDDER ENDED.</i>

15:11.375 --> 15:13.875
WE SHOULD'VE ARRANGED
A PLACE TO MEET.

15:13.943 --> 15:16.643
HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND
LEONARDO AND RAPHAEL?

15:20.181 --> 15:22.415
UH, I THINK WE JUST
FOUND THEM.

15:22.516 --> 15:24.282
I THINK CAN WE HANDLE
THEM, DON'T YOU?

15:24.384 --> 15:26.684
WHY NOT? THERE'S ONLY
TWO OF THEM.

15:26.752 --> 15:30.587
WE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT
WE DO TO MUTANTS.

15:35.592 --> 15:39.260
LET'S SEE HOW BRAVE
YOU MUTANTS ARE.

15:39.328 --> 15:43.029
LET'S SEE HOW BRAVE
YOU HUMANS ARE. BOO.

15:44.798 --> 15:48.934
VERNON, THIS IS NO TIME
TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK!

15:49.035 --> 15:52.102
HEY, FOUR AGAINST
TWO. NO FAIR.

15:52.204 --> 15:53.904
LET'S EVEN UP
THE ODDS.

15:58.441 --> 16:00.642
WE'VE GOTTA HELP
THOSE TURTLES!

16:00.744 --> 16:04.579
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M
STILL NOT SURE WHY.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.381
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M
STILIT'S APRIL AND IRMA!

16:09.449 --> 16:09.749
YOU REALLY
LOWERED THE BOOM

16:12.785 --> 16:14.786
OH, PLE-PLEASE,
DON'T HURT ME,

16:17.655 --> 16:19.822
ONLY KIDDING,
FELLAS.

16:19.890 --> 16:21.590
SOME OF MY BEST
FRIENDS ARE MUTANTS.

16:21.658 --> 16:24.425
MORE ROCK SOLDIERS!

16:25.861 --> 16:29.597
COME ON, CLIMB UP.

16:29.664 --> 16:30.330
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY.

16:35.635 --> 16:37.035
HELPING MUTANTS.

16:44.974 --> 16:48.343
LIKE
WAIT UNTIL
THINGS CALM DOWN,LITOR.

16:48.378 --> 16:50.078
THANKS APRIL, IRMA.

16:50.146 --> 16:53.012
OU REALIZED THAT
WE'RE NOT THE BAD GUYS.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.648
HEY, FOR A BUNCH OF GUYS

16:54.716 --> 16:56.281
WITH BALD HEADS
AND GREEN SKIN,

16:56.349 --> 16:58.450
...KIND OF CUTE.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.487
WHATEVER WORLD
SHE'S THE SAME IRMA.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.621
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET BACK

17:04.689 --> 17:06.089
TO OUR OWN UNIVERSE.

17:07.223 --> 17:09.425
HEY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:09.460 --> 17:12.727
IT FELT LIKE
ONE HUMONGOUS EARTHQUAKE.

17:12.795 --> 17:15.329
WRONG.
IT'S THE TECHNODROME.

17:15.396 --> 17:17.964
THE GENERATORS ARE
STARTING TO OVERLOAD.

17:18.031 --> 17:19.332
IF THEY AREN'T COOLED OFF,

17:19.400 --> 17:21.933
THE ENTIRE TECHNODROME
WILL BLOW UP.

17:22.002 --> 17:23.902
WHAT A MESS.

17:23.936 --> 17:26.137
I'VE SEEN CARS
AT A DEMOLITION DERBY

17:26.204 --> 17:27.439
IN BETTER CONDITION.

17:30.942 --> 17:34.677
AREN'T YOU THE TECHNODROME
IN BETTEREPAIR MUTANTS?

17:34.712 --> 17:36.978
NO, WE'RE THE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA...

17:37.046 --> 17:39.380
OH, NEVER MIND.

17:39.447 --> 17:42.148
WELL, WHOEVER YOU ARE,
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

17:42.215 --> 17:44.984
THE POWER GENERATORS
HAVE OVERLOADED.

17:45.052 --> 17:47.820
THEY'RE GOING
TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

17:47.854 --> 17:49.320
AND YOU BETTER
GO TELL SHREDDER

17:49.388 --> 17:51.088
TO REDIVERT THE COOLANT.

17:51.156 --> 17:53.156
ARE YOU INSANE?

17:53.223 --> 17:55.224
I'M PUTTING
AS MUCH DISTANCE

17:55.292 --> 17:56.792
BETWEEN ME
AND THAT THING

17:56.860 --> 17:58.460
AS POSSIBLE.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.662
NOW MOVE IT,
DIM BULB.

18:01.864 --> 18:03.397
DESTROY ALL MUTANTS!

18:03.465 --> 18:06.633
MUTANTS ARE THE ENEMY!

18:06.701 --> 18:09.435
WE ARE EXPERIENCING
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

18:09.503 --> 18:12.903
OUR REGULAR BRAINWASHING
WILL RESUME MOMENTARILY.

18:12.972 --> 18:15.972
ACTUALLY, THIS UNIVERSE ISN'T
TOO DIFFERENT FROM OURS.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.741
I TOLD YOU GUYS
TO COME BACK LATER!

18:18.809 --> 18:19.976
THERE'S NO TIME
TO WAIT.

18:20.044 --> 18:21.576
THE TECHNODROME
WILL BLOW UP

18:21.644 --> 18:23.645
IF SHREDDER DOESN'T
DO SOMETHING.

18:23.747 --> 18:26.580
OH, OK. FOLLOW US.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.415
SHREDDER'S OFFICE
IS THIS WAY.

18:29.550 --> 18:31.885
HOLD IT,
MUTANT WIMPS.

18:31.953 --> 18:33.151
YOU AGAIN?

18:33.219 --> 18:35.287
WE ALREADY SENT YOU
TO THE CLEANERS.

18:35.355 --> 18:37.654
YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE BACK AGAIN,

18:37.722 --> 18:40.190
DIRTIER THAN EVER.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.891
AERIAL ATTACK.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.028
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THEM!

18:49.831 --> 18:51.198
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:51.266 --> 18:53.467
OR...COMING OFF?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.402
EVEN OUR WEAPONS
ARE FALLING APART

18:56.470 --> 18:58.203
IN THIS WORLD.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.739
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
IT'S SHREDDERVILLE.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.607
NOW WE GOT YOU.

19:07.678 --> 19:10.812
TAKE US TO SHREDDER'S OFFICE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

19:12.581 --> 19:15.448
THIS IS SHREDDER'S OFFICE,

19:15.516 --> 19:18.418
BUT NO ONE'S EVER GOTTEN
BEYOND THOSE DOORS.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.721
SOLID BRONZE.
AND A FOOT THICK.

19:22.755 --> 19:24.622
END OF THE ROAD, DUDES.

19:24.690 --> 19:27.224
NO WAY WE'RE GONNA
BREAK DOWN THESE DOORS.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.027
WELL, MAYBE ONE WAY.

19:35.932 --> 19:37.665
IT'S SO DARK IN HERE.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.566
YEAH, SO I SEE.

19:39.634 --> 19:42.168
WHAT FOOL
DARES DISTURB

19:42.236 --> 19:45.303
THE ALL-POWERFUL SHREDDER?

19:45.372 --> 19:46.538
LET'S SEE,
THERE SHOULD BE

19:46.606 --> 19:48.038
ONE HERE SOMEWHERE.

19:48.106 --> 19:51.675
DO NOT TOUCH THAT!
I FORBID IT!

19:53.611 --> 19:56.778
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO TOUCH THAT.

19:56.846 --> 20:01.416
OH, NOTHING WORKS
AROUND HERE.

20:01.517 --> 20:03.383
WHY ARE
YOU MUTANTS HERE?

20:03.451 --> 20:05.217
TO WARN YOU TO
DIVERT THE COOLANT

20:05.285 --> 20:08.287
BACK TO THE TECHNODROME
BEFORE IT GOES KABLOOEY.

20:08.389 --> 20:10.188
I'VE ONLY GOT
2 HANDS!

20:10.323 --> 20:12.423
LOOK AT ALL THESE
REPAIR REQUESTS!

20:12.491 --> 20:14.692
EVERYTHING
IS BROKEN.

20:14.760 --> 20:15.759
TELL ME ABOUT IT!

20:15.827 --> 20:17.993
YOU SHOULD SEE
MY HAIR DRYER.

20:18.062 --> 20:21.196
YOU THINK BEING EMPEROR
OF THE WORLD IS EASY?

20:21.264 --> 20:23.765
OH, IT'S GIVING ME
AN ULCER.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.900
WE WANT TO GET BACK
TO OUR WORLD,

20:26.967 --> 20:28.468
WHERE YOU DON'T RULE.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.603
A WORLD WHERE
I DON'T RULE?

20:30.704 --> 20:31.870
OH, PLEASE,
TAKE ME WITH YOU,

20:34.273 --> 20:36.841
LOOK OUT, THE WHOLE SIDE
OF THE BUILDING IS GONE!

20:36.909 --> 20:39.643
THAT'S IT,
I ABDICATE THE THRONE!

20:39.644 --> 20:41.544
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT!

20:41.612 --> 20:43.145
NEVER MIND
SHREDDER.

20:43.213 --> 20:45.346
LOOK AT
THE TECHNODROME!

20:45.415 --> 20:47.148
IT'S ABOUT
TO EXPLODE!

20:51.587 --> 20:54.954
YO, DUDES, I THINK
I'M LOSING MY GRIP!

20:55.022 --> 20:56.722
I COULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.491
COME ON, YOU GUYS,
YOU CAN DO IT.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.426
I-I'M TRYING.

21:03.494 --> 21:06.195
GET UP, DONATELLO.
GET UP!

21:06.230 --> 21:08.096
I...I CAN'T.

21:08.165 --> 21:09.664
GET UP,
DONATELLO.

21:09.731 --> 21:10.765
GET UP.

21:10.832 --> 21:13.500
DONATELLO, GET UP.

21:13.568 --> 21:16.069
OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

21:16.137 --> 21:17.804
AM I OK?

21:17.905 --> 21:20.139
DID THE TECHNODROME
BLOW UP?

21:20.240 --> 21:21.974
DID APRIL AND
IRMA GET AWAY?

21:22.041 --> 21:24.774
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO EMPEROR SHREDDER?

21:24.843 --> 21:26.644
WE'RE IN THE LAIR.

21:26.678 --> 21:28.544
IT WAS ALL A DREAM!

21:31.081 --> 21:32.414
WELL, MY TURTLES,

21:32.482 --> 21:34.316
IF YOU SHARED
THE SAME DREAM,

21:34.384 --> 21:37.385
I HOPE YOU ALL LEARNED
THE SAME LESSON.

21:37.452 --> 21:38.718
WE KNOW!

21:38.786 --> 21:40.887
BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

21:40.955 --> 21:43.388
YOU JUST
MIGHT GET IT.

21:43.457 --> 21:45.389
PRECISELY.
