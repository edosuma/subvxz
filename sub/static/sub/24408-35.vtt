09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah. I knew it was too good to be true.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh, my gosh. It says instant winner.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
-Let me see. -Yeah, look.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Bring this wrapper to the McGoldy Candy Factory,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
and you will receive a special tour

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
from our reclusive owner, Moldy McGoldy,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
and $50,000.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Kelsey, where's the McGoldy Candy Factory?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Eh, bad news, the McGoldy Candy Factory

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
is in Kentucky. -Aw.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And Moldy McGoldy passed away.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Aw.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
And the McGoldy Candy Company folded in 1964

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
due to too many winning candy bars.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
So we don't get the money?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
-No. -Aw.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Man, that's so -- that's so...such a whack!

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Ugh. I'm gonna be doing chores

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
for the rest of my life.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I'll never be able to become Silverfist now.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
The gold was a necessary component,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
but, hey, we got each other,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and we got this chocolate

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
from the bottom of the creek.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
That's nasty. You nasty.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
[ Sighs ]

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
We spent all day pulling trash out of the water.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
We've got nothing to show for it.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, but this place does look like

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
less of a dump now.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
It's kind of nice.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah, I'd get in that water.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I'd get all up in that water.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah. You're right, Kelsey.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm glad we cleaned this place up.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I mean, we've only got one creek,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
and now we've got another sweet spot where we can hang out.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah, and I could always use another place

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
to wash the blood off my sword. -All right.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Well, I guess we can't just leave this stuff here.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
You think the junk lord would want some of this?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah, definitely.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
But would he pay for it, though?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
He might.
