02:49.487 --> 02:52.855
“There is not a righteous man on earth

02:52.857 --> 02:57.126
who does what is right and never sins.”

02:57.128 --> 02:59.562
Ecclesiastes 7:20.

03:09.974 --> 03:12.108
Hey.

03:12.110 --> 03:14.243
Oye.

03:51.149 --> 03:52.648
I should call my mom.

03:57.822 --> 04:00.223
You need...

04:02.727 --> 04:05.728
Your mommy?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.964
You're gonna need a lot
more than that, vato.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.184
You're American?

04:19.887 --> 04:22.154
Where's your identification?

04:29.931 --> 04:31.330
I don't know.

04:31.332 --> 04:34.334
Your papers? Passport?

04:36.201 --> 04:38.471
Something's wrong. I can't...

04:38.473 --> 04:40.539
I can't remember anything.

04:43.144 --> 04:46.345
What's your name?

04:47.919 --> 04:50.858
What happened to your hand?

04:56.878 --> 04:58.301
I don't know.

04:58.326 --> 05:01.427
It seems like the kind of
thing a person would remember.

05:01.429 --> 05:04.049
It could get infected.

05:06.960 --> 05:06.993
Sí.

05:08.861 --> 05:10.136
Thank you.

05:12.340 --> 05:14.474
I should call someone.

05:14.474 --> 05:15.341
You don't get a phone call.

05:15.707 --> 05:18.644
That surprises Americans
when they get in trouble here.

05:19.141 --> 05:21.213
But maybe if you help me figure out

05:21.215 --> 05:23.215
why you had narcotics
in your possession,

05:23.217 --> 05:25.641
I can help you notify someone.

05:26.220 --> 05:29.491
You forgot that, too?
In the trunk of your car?

05:32.348 --> 05:33.793
What were you doing way out there?

05:33.795 --> 05:35.427
I, uh...

05:35.429 --> 05:37.997
was meeting someone.

05:37.999 --> 05:42.514
I was meeting a woman.

05:42.670 --> 05:45.070
I'm not usually like this.

05:45.565 --> 05:47.093
Heroin will do that.

05:48.658 --> 05:49.441
I don't use drugs.

05:49.443 --> 05:51.877
You just run them.

05:52.866 --> 05:54.346
You're not high right now?

05:58.753 --> 06:01.287
Why are you in Mexico?

06:01.689 --> 06:04.290
Because I'm trying to...

06:04.292 --> 06:05.724
help my mom.

06:06.628 --> 06:08.419
Your mother is with you in Mexico?

06:09.201 --> 06:12.813
Mm-mmm. She's not, but...

06:15.403 --> 06:17.403
Rosa.

06:18.648 --> 06:21.674
I'm meeting Rosa, who's a doctor,

06:21.676 --> 06:23.442
so I should find her.

06:23.444 --> 06:24.743
Rosa who?

06:24.745 --> 06:26.579
Where does she live?

06:26.581 --> 06:28.247
I'm sorry, I don't know.

06:28.249 --> 06:29.949
Jefe.

06:29.951 --> 06:30.883
Deme.

06:30.885 --> 06:32.751
Yeah.

06:37.525 --> 06:39.273
You're not just American.

06:41.421 --> 06:43.796
You're Dr. Spencer Reid with the FBI?

06:53.443 --> 06:54.640
Thanks, Cruz. This is bad.

06:55.403 --> 06:56.785
I know. It doesn't make sense.

06:58.723 --> 07:00.079
What's wrong?

07:00.399 --> 07:02.219
Reid is in jail.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.354
Jail?

07:03.356 --> 07:04.522
In Mexico.

07:05.103 --> 07:06.734
What the hell is he doing down there?

07:06.734 --> 07:07.858
I don't know. I didn't talk to him.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.127
The call came in to Cruz
from their lead investigator.

07:10.499 --> 07:11.882
What's he being held for?

07:11.882 --> 07:14.732
Drug possession,
with intent to distribute.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.013
What type of drugs?

07:16.570 --> 07:17.783
Cocaine and heroin.

07:17.842 --> 07:19.803
Oh, my God.

07:19.805 --> 07:20.838
This can't be happening.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.339
We need Lewis and Walker here asap.

07:23.245 --> 07:25.009
Yeah. I can call them. I can do that.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.713
I'm gonna run some tests

07:29.715 --> 07:31.582
to figure out what you're on right now.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.485
Thank you. Helpful.

07:34.487 --> 07:38.422
We're having a hard time
finding this Dr. Rosa.

07:39.047 --> 07:41.325
You still don't remember her last name
or where you met her?

07:41.327 --> 07:42.927
I'm trying.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.399
When my officers chased you,

07:48.401 --> 07:50.734
you were racing toward the border.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.670
My guess is you planned on crossing it.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.372
Is that true?

07:54.974 --> 07:58.442
No, I, uh...

07:58.444 --> 08:01.679
Think I was chasing someone.

08:10.561 --> 08:11.455
Who?

08:15.376 --> 08:16.382
They were in front of me.

08:22.031 --> 08:24.507
Maybe your officers saw them.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.837
They did.

08:27.509 --> 08:29.007
No one got the tags.

08:29.921 --> 08:32.019
This has to be a mistake.

08:32.434 --> 08:34.182
I think I'm being framed.

08:35.823 --> 08:37.381
You have enemies who would do this?

08:41.082 --> 08:42.927
This has got to be Scratch.

08:42.927 --> 08:45.073
He was laying low. Now we know why.

08:45.073 --> 08:47.789
Crossing the border as a
fugitive is a huge risk.

08:47.789 --> 08:50.076
The reward is greater.
He's been punishing the team.

08:50.076 --> 08:51.284
Now his target is Reid.

08:51.284 --> 08:52.704
Peter Lewis dropped off the map

08:52.704 --> 08:54.162
after attacking Tara's family.

08:54.162 --> 08:56.358
Maybe he's been hiding
in Mexico this whole time.

08:56.358 --> 08:58.600
We also have to consider
this isn't related to him.

08:58.749 --> 09:00.030
Who else would it be?

09:00.179 --> 09:01.205
Drug cartels.

09:01.606 --> 09:04.364
Could have threatened Reid
and used him as a mule.

09:04.684 --> 09:06.955
Agreed. This could simply
be a case of bad luck.

09:06.955 --> 09:08.697
Reid was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

09:08.697 --> 09:10.026
Spence's mom is ok.

09:10.026 --> 09:12.172
The home nurse he hired
said all is stable.

09:12.172 --> 09:13.483
Oh, thank the stars.

09:13.483 --> 09:15.503
How long did he
tell the nurse he'd be gone?

09:15.503 --> 09:16.282
Uh, 3 days.

09:16.586 --> 09:17.079
That sounds reasonable.

09:17.079 --> 09:18.563
After the Palm Springs case,

09:18.563 --> 09:20.303
Reid said he had to get back to Houston

09:20.303 --> 09:22.111
to talk to his mom's doctor.

09:22.111 --> 09:24.752
Well, Houston is only a
5-hour drive from the border.

09:24.752 --> 09:25.965
Usually I can read him.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.293
I can't believe I didn't
pick up on any of this.

09:28.293 --> 09:30.084
He didn't want you
to, and there's no way

09:30.084 --> 09:31.734
you would have guessed
he'd end up in Mexico.

09:31.734 --> 09:33.463
The question is, why
did he go down there?

09:33.463 --> 09:35.189
And why does he have narcotics?

09:35.189 --> 09:36.140
Yeah, exactly. That... that...

09:36.142 --> 09:38.318
He wouldn't... he wouldn't do that.

09:38.318 --> 09:40.384
I'm not gonna share any
secrets I'm not supposed to,

09:40.384 --> 09:42.051
but those drugs were planted on him.

09:42.051 --> 09:44.383
Absolutely. But there's
something bigger in play.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.701
That's why he crossed the
border and kept it a secret.

09:46.701 --> 09:49.161
There's something he didn't
want to share with any of you.

09:49.161 --> 09:51.170
Ok, so what would make
him risk everything?

09:51.368 --> 09:52.490
His mom.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.325
Yeah, but she's here and she's safe.

09:54.325 --> 09:55.928
Oh, wait.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.578
Cruz just sent me the arresting report.

09:57.578 --> 09:58.929
Hold, please. Translating now.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.631
O... k.

10:01.587 --> 10:05.265
It says here that Reid was involved
in a high-speed chase.

10:05.265 --> 10:07.515
What? He hardly ever drives.

10:07.515 --> 10:08.820
None of this sounds like him.

10:08.820 --> 10:11.508
It says he was wearing jeans,
he was really confused. And...

10:11.811 --> 10:14.860
According to the arresting officer,
he was really high on something.

10:15.605 --> 10:16.981
No, no, he wouldn't do that.

10:16.981 --> 10:18.730
Not after what happened
with Tobias Hankel.

10:19.143 --> 10:19.915
Who's that?

10:19.951 --> 10:23.029
An offender with D.I.D.
who kidnapped and drugged Reid.

10:23.407 --> 10:24.613
When was this?

10:24.813 --> 10:25.422
10 years ago.

10:25.424 --> 10:28.176
What does the report say
about the intent to distribute.

10:28.176 --> 10:31.588
Uh, it says he was charged
with constructive possession,

10:31.588 --> 10:33.864
and in the duffel bag
there was cocaine, cash,

10:33.866 --> 10:36.667
and 3 bricks of heroin.

10:40.272 --> 10:41.935
Ok, we'll be there in less than an hour.

10:41.935 --> 10:43.403
Dave, were you able
to reach Jack Garrett?

10:43.403 --> 10:45.484
He's deep in a case, but he
promised to do what he can.

10:45.484 --> 10:47.907
Ok. We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.305
Oh... please don't.

11:52.022 --> 11:54.690
Please, I don't want it.
I don't want it.

12:57.712 --> 12:59.434
Spencer, please go to the other room.

12:59.434 --> 13:00.995
Don't treat him like a child.

13:00.995 --> 13:03.104
I'm not gonna have this
conversation in front of him.

13:03.104 --> 13:04.262
I'm not crazy.

13:04.262 --> 13:07.384
If you refuse to take care
of yourself, I can't help you.

13:08.022 --> 13:09.888
You're weak.

13:15.196 --> 13:16.795
I'm not weak.

13:17.138 --> 13:19.519
I know, honey.

13:21.135 --> 13:23.102
I'm not weak.

13:23.104 --> 13:25.170
I'm not weak.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.272
I'm not weak.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.541
I'm not weak.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.140
I'm not weak.

13:36.769 --> 13:38.960
You know, we should check
with Monty over at IRT

13:38.960 --> 13:41.166
to see how many times Reid
has crossed the border.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.172
Our smarts are on the same channel.
I just IM'ed him.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.734
Where are you with the searches?

13:45.250 --> 13:48.776
The scratch of it all,
I am thus far coming up with nothing.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.035
For all we know, Peter Lewis
could be in Mexico

13:51.035 --> 13:52.187
orchestrating this whole thing.

13:52.187 --> 13:54.600
We're talking about a dude
who hacked into DMV records,

13:54.600 --> 13:57.805
and cross that with a cyber wall
run by the Mexican drug cartel,

13:57.805 --> 14:00.276
which is and even scarier
wall of cyber than I'm used to.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.209
What about Reid?

14:01.379 --> 14:03.336
Oh, right. Well, luckily,

14:03.336 --> 14:05.772
he leaves more digital
breadcrumbs than Mr. Lewis,

14:05.772 --> 14:08.239
i.e., I have info on
Reid's flight to Houston.

14:08.239 --> 14:10.037
Looks like he checked in
and out of a hotel there.

14:10.037 --> 14:13.284
But if he rented wheels to get to
Mexico, there's no record of it.

14:13.340 --> 14:15.281
Well, maybe he has a contact down there

14:15.281 --> 14:16.471
and he could have borrowed their car.

14:16.951 --> 14:17.874
He could have taken a bus.

14:17.874 --> 14:19.184
There's all kinds of
ways to cross the border.

14:19.184 --> 14:20.451
I'll keep looking.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.990
Ok, so I dug around his desk,

14:21.990 --> 14:24.232
I found a whole lot of
articles in medical journals,

14:24.232 --> 14:25.734
no big surprise.

14:26.652 --> 14:29.121
This is all about experimental medicine.

14:29.793 --> 14:31.486
Ok. Experimental medicine makes sense.

14:31.486 --> 14:33.833
I got an email from a
librarian friend of mine

14:33.833 --> 14:36.011
from the FBI library.
It looks like our boy wonder

14:36.011 --> 14:38.023
has been processing a lot with
that beautiful brain of his,

14:38.023 --> 14:40.568
all having to do with
alternative medicinal procedures

14:40.568 --> 14:41.346
for fighting Alzheimer's.

14:41.908 --> 14:43.802
Well, he told me he was
supplementing her meds

14:43.802 --> 14:46.840
with omega-3s and making sure
she was eating a ton of leafy greens.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.083
But he said her prescriptions
plus vitamins weren't enough.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.849
Maybe he took it to a new level.

14:52.212 --> 14:54.919
Because it takes years to
pass the FDA guidelines,

14:54.921 --> 14:58.256
a lot of holistic medicine is
practiced outside the United States.

14:58.958 --> 15:02.660
Ok, they have landed and
they are on the way to Spence.

15:04.363 --> 15:07.031
All right, well, let's
start digging through these,

15:07.033 --> 15:08.766
see if we can find
anything that can help.

15:11.037 --> 15:13.370
Thanks for calling us.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.940
A U.S. fed in our custody isn't
something we see every day.

15:15.942 --> 15:18.109
We appreciate you
letting us talk to him.

15:18.111 --> 15:19.977
Have you gotten his tox
screen panels back yet?

15:19.979 --> 15:20.578
No.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.862
You will need to expedite that.

15:21.862 --> 15:24.448
We have cause to believe
that Agent Reid was drugged.

15:24.450 --> 15:27.108
He was definitely high
and driving like a maniac

15:27.108 --> 15:29.687
with $20,000 worth of
heroin in his possession.

15:29.689 --> 15:32.479
Both of which put my officers at risk.

15:32.703 --> 15:33.799
You're in our jurisdiction.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.427
The rules are different here.

15:36.429 --> 15:37.362
We understand.

15:42.201 --> 15:43.367
Hey, Reid.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.055
It's good to see you, brother.

15:46.765 --> 15:48.972
It's me, Luke.

15:53.212 --> 15:56.015
Luke.

15:57.717 --> 15:59.283
Thank you for coming.

15:59.285 --> 16:00.719
Of course.

16:01.921 --> 16:04.179
We're gonna get you out of here, kid.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.814
We need to work out some
details with the locals, ok?

16:10.539 --> 16:12.863
Who was your contact down here?

16:14.200 --> 16:15.370
Rosa.

16:16.869 --> 16:20.437
Rosa Medina. I think she's a doctor.

16:23.242 --> 16:24.575
All right.

16:24.577 --> 16:26.544
Where did you meet her?

16:26.546 --> 16:28.028
I don't remember.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.684
If you saw her, would you remember her?

16:36.189 --> 16:38.681
Yeah. I think so.

16:38.724 --> 16:40.901
You're missing time, aren't you?

16:42.101 --> 16:44.232
It's peeking out.
It's coming in flashes.

16:44.764 --> 16:46.610
And you've been drugged.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.332
Yeah, but I didn't take it myself.

16:48.334 --> 16:50.994
Well, of course you didn't, Spencer.

16:52.205 --> 16:54.994
We're thinking it might be Scratch.

16:56.242 --> 16:57.841
Scratch.

17:01.214 --> 17:03.111
Excuse me.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.282
Hey, JJ.

17:06.285 --> 17:07.451
Is he ok?

17:07.453 --> 17:09.118
Yeah. I mean, he's in one piece.

17:09.121 --> 17:11.155
I'm not sure he recognizes us.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.290
That could be the drugs.

17:13.291 --> 17:14.592
Would a cognitive help?

17:14.594 --> 17:16.460
I really think we're a little far off

17:16.462 --> 17:18.596
for that right now. Um,

17:18.598 --> 17:20.931
he definitely didn't
recognize Scratch's name.

17:20.933 --> 17:23.267
But he wrote the name
of his local contact,

17:23.269 --> 17:24.835
Rosa Medina, on his arm.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.470
I just sent the pic to Garcia.

17:26.472 --> 17:27.871
He says that she's a doctor.

17:27.873 --> 17:30.407
So his short-term is coming back,
but it's limited.

17:30.409 --> 17:31.942
It sounds like his
long-term is still a mess.

17:31.944 --> 17:33.611
Ok, this definitely
reads chicken scratch,

17:33.613 --> 17:36.580
but it's... oh, there are a
lot of Rosa Medinas in Mexico.

17:36.582 --> 17:39.316
Well, let's start with women
in Houston and Brownsville,

17:39.318 --> 17:40.684
and then cross them
with Mexican citizens.

17:40.686 --> 17:41.685
Got it.

17:41.687 --> 17:44.455
He told Emily
he was gonna talk to his mom's doctor.

17:44.457 --> 17:47.057
If that was true, we all assumed

17:47.059 --> 17:48.726
it was the doctor from the clinic,

17:48.728 --> 17:50.461
but maybe it was this Rosa Medina.

17:50.463 --> 17:52.329
And she could be being
cautious, which is why

17:52.331 --> 17:54.431
we haven't been able to find
any communication between them.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.200
And why should she be cautious?

17:56.202 --> 17:59.236
Well, because in 2015,
60 holistic doctors

17:59.238 --> 18:01.038
across the United States
died mysteriously.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.641
Some were accidents,
others violent attacks,

18:03.643 --> 18:05.242
others were deemed suicide.

18:05.244 --> 18:07.411
Conspiracy theorists
believe these doctors

18:07.413 --> 18:09.446
were targeted fatally by
pharmaceutical companies

18:09.448 --> 18:11.248
for their belief in holistic practice.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.550
Well, then Rosa Medina
might not be her real name.

18:13.552 --> 18:14.785
You think she might have an alias?

18:14.787 --> 18:16.854
Look, I've seen it plenty of times.

18:16.856 --> 18:18.856
If she's afraid of consequences,

18:18.858 --> 18:20.291
maybe she used an anagram.

18:20.293 --> 18:22.259
How many holistic
doctors with connections

18:22.261 --> 18:24.229
between Texas and Mexico?

18:25.131 --> 18:27.398
Uh, Sophia Flores.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.266
Ana Sorel.

18:29.268 --> 18:30.701
Nadie Ramos.

18:30.703 --> 18:32.336
Juliet Hernandez.

18:39.345 --> 18:42.763
What's the story with Nadie Ramos?

18:43.783 --> 18:47.251
Uh... uh, let's see.

18:49.322 --> 18:51.889
She specializes in experimental drugs

18:51.891 --> 18:53.724
that reverse brain degeneration.

18:53.726 --> 18:55.059
Have you got a photo?

18:55.061 --> 18:57.604
Yep. Sending it to you guys right now.

18:59.732 --> 19:01.065
Hey, the team sent this.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.879
Is this the doctor you met?

19:08.874 --> 19:09.807
Yeah.

19:09.809 --> 19:11.275
Her alias is Rosa Medina.

19:11.277 --> 19:13.344
Her real name is Nadie Ramos.

19:13.346 --> 19:15.145
Garcia tracked her to a motel

19:15.147 --> 19:17.739
just outside of town.
Does that sound familiar?

19:19.051 --> 19:20.684
No.

19:20.686 --> 19:22.186
We'll need to take Castenada

19:22.188 --> 19:23.454
and his officers with us.

19:23.456 --> 19:25.923
You want company here?

19:25.925 --> 19:29.560
No, I'm... I'm ok.

19:33.999 --> 19:36.734
Manager says he hasn't seen her all day.

19:36.736 --> 19:39.217
If she's left town, this
won't be good for Reid.

19:39.572 --> 19:41.667
No puede pasar.

20:01.127 --> 20:02.960
Damn, she's dead.

20:02.962 --> 20:05.629
This isn't good.

20:17.852 --> 20:22.156
Tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete...

20:23.391 --> 20:25.224
This doesn't look good for your friend.

20:25.226 --> 20:28.294
Come on. We both know

20:28.296 --> 20:30.296
these things could have
been planted in here

20:30.298 --> 20:33.599
just as the drugs could have
been planted in the trunk.

20:33.601 --> 20:36.502
Framed for drugs. Framed for murder.

20:36.504 --> 20:39.372
You're not even considering the obvious?

20:39.374 --> 20:42.557
You wouldn't either if
you knew Spencer Reid.

20:43.178 --> 20:44.610
We've both got a job to do.

20:44.612 --> 20:47.714
I'll get all this processed.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.290
And we'll continue to fight
to prove he's innocent.

20:53.655 --> 20:55.955
Reid's stuff was everywhere.

20:55.957 --> 20:59.325
If they run DNA, he'll
be all over this room.

20:59.327 --> 21:00.960
Maybe even on the victim.

21:00.962 --> 21:03.396
The coroner counted over 25 stab wounds.

21:03.398 --> 21:05.131
There's still no sign of the knife?

21:05.133 --> 21:06.566
No.

21:06.568 --> 21:08.301
We've got a disorganized crime scene

21:08.303 --> 21:09.602
with the offender aware enough

21:09.604 --> 21:11.304
to take the murder weapon with them.

21:11.306 --> 21:12.839
It doesn't add up.

21:12.841 --> 21:14.774
Unless it was a drug-induced kill.

21:14.776 --> 21:16.642
The unsub could have freaked out

21:16.644 --> 21:18.144
and taken off with the knife.

21:18.146 --> 21:21.814
Reid told Castenada
he was chasing someone.

21:21.816 --> 21:23.649
It could have been the killer.

21:23.651 --> 21:26.252
Yeah. Well, if they
took the knife with them,

21:26.254 --> 21:28.221
they could have dumped it in the desert.

21:28.223 --> 21:30.556
And Reid's got a nasty cut on his hand.

21:30.558 --> 21:32.392
It could be from the same blade.

21:32.394 --> 21:33.926
He didn't do this.

21:33.928 --> 21:35.995
I know.

21:35.997 --> 21:38.131
But Scratch has done one hell of a job

21:38.133 --> 21:39.866
making it look like he did.

21:55.049 --> 21:57.216
How are you holding up?

21:59.120 --> 22:04.090
Well, it's been quite a year, but...

22:04.092 --> 22:06.325
This...

22:09.671 --> 22:10.850
You two are close.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.548
He's my best friend.

22:16.756 --> 22:19.123
Yeah, he's stronger than anyone knows,

22:19.125 --> 22:22.427
but he is not equipped to be locked up.

22:22.429 --> 22:24.729
Well, I never thought I'd say this,

22:24.731 --> 22:29.133
but maybe the drugs are
helping with any anxiety.

22:29.135 --> 22:30.802
Well, I thought the same.

22:30.804 --> 22:33.104
I mean, I want him to come down,

22:33.106 --> 22:36.307
but then when he's sober,

22:36.309 --> 22:39.605
time's gonna stand still and
that will drive him crazy.

22:43.349 --> 22:47.218
So Monty tracked Reid's passport.

22:47.220 --> 22:49.420
Turns out he used his personal

22:49.422 --> 22:51.422
and not his work issued one,

22:51.424 --> 22:54.092
which makes sense,
because he wasn't working,

22:54.094 --> 22:55.426
right? Say right.

22:55.428 --> 22:57.862
Mm, working or not, he
should have been briefed

22:57.864 --> 22:59.363
before leaving the
country and he wasn't.

22:59.365 --> 23:01.365
So on a scale of one to terrible?

23:01.367 --> 23:02.967
It's terrible.

23:02.969 --> 23:04.602
The Bureau's gonna hold it against him.

23:04.604 --> 23:06.337
He violated security protocol.

23:06.339 --> 23:08.806
I mean, as a federal agent,
he's a high-value target.

23:08.808 --> 23:10.575
You know this. The brass doesn't like it

23:10.577 --> 23:12.076
when you keep them in the dark.

23:12.078 --> 23:15.046
Why did he keep us out of this?

23:15.048 --> 23:16.814
I didn't know he
crossed the border once,

23:16.816 --> 23:18.349
let alone 3 times.

23:18.351 --> 23:20.785
3 times in the last 3 months?
What was he doing down there?

23:20.787 --> 23:24.021
Lying. He was lying. Every
time he crossed the border,

23:24.023 --> 23:25.656
he lied to us, and he went all rogue,

23:25.658 --> 23:27.592
and he got himself in
all this damn trouble.

23:27.594 --> 23:28.960
We'll, he was making decisions

23:28.962 --> 23:30.561
with his heart and not his head.

23:30.563 --> 23:31.996
Which I'm intimately familiar with,

23:31.998 --> 23:33.564
but none of this would have happened

23:33.566 --> 23:34.766
if he would have let us help.

23:34.768 --> 23:38.852
Well, Penelope, that's what
we're gonna do now. Ok?

23:39.873 --> 23:42.520
Well, I'm still mad at him.

23:44.744 --> 23:47.145
We know you didn't do this.

23:47.147 --> 23:49.313
How did it happen?

23:49.315 --> 23:51.883
She was stabbed, multiple times.

23:51.885 --> 23:53.217
It looked personal.

23:53.219 --> 23:56.154
We got the results of your blood work.

23:56.156 --> 23:58.356
There's cocaine and
heroin in your system.

23:58.358 --> 23:59.657
What else?

23:59.659 --> 24:01.259
He was in possession
of cocaine and heroin

24:01.261 --> 24:03.528
when he was arrested.
I found what I need.

24:03.530 --> 24:05.363
No, I need a full tox screen panel.

24:05.365 --> 24:06.864
We're looking for scopolamine.

24:06.866 --> 24:08.499
That'll take longer.

24:08.501 --> 24:10.368
I don't care. I need it.

24:10.370 --> 24:12.870
You were given a speedball.

24:12.872 --> 24:14.906
The opiates block the dopamine.

24:14.908 --> 24:17.809
That's why thing go from clear to hazy.

24:17.811 --> 24:19.377
The combination of the drugs

24:19.379 --> 24:22.146
causes a dissociative state
and explains the memory loss.

24:22.148 --> 24:23.881
Are you coming down now?

24:23.883 --> 24:25.216
I think so.

24:25.218 --> 24:27.919
Do you think you could
do a cognitive interview?

24:28.521 --> 24:29.887
I'll try.

24:29.889 --> 24:32.023
Do you have a quiet room we can use?

24:32.025 --> 24:34.826
Yes. There were 5 of these

24:34.828 --> 24:36.027
in your bag at the motel.

24:36.029 --> 24:38.149
You recognize them?

24:52.312 --> 24:55.868
I put it in some orange juice
so it won't taste so bad.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.293
What is it?

25:12.065 --> 25:14.233
I'm gonna run it through the lab.

25:18.705 --> 25:23.127
Whatever's in those vials,
I was giving it to my mom.

25:23.977 --> 25:26.156
That's the only thing I'm sure of.

25:33.453 --> 25:35.720
So Emily said they're
gonna try a cognitive,

25:35.722 --> 25:36.888
but she isn't very hopeful.

25:36.890 --> 25:38.723
Did they run a full tox screen?

25:38.725 --> 25:41.292
No. No, they only looked
for cocaine and heroin

25:41.294 --> 25:43.227
because those were the
drugs in his possession.

25:43.229 --> 25:44.604
And?

25:44.797 --> 25:46.664
And he tested positive for both.

25:46.666 --> 25:47.765
What?

25:47.767 --> 25:49.233
Well, there's gotta be

25:49.235 --> 25:50.902
some other sedative present

25:50.904 --> 25:52.937
for him to be missing so much time.

25:52.939 --> 25:55.039
Look, they're only gonna
investigate what helps their case,

25:55.041 --> 25:57.174
and right now, they have
a dead Mexican citizen

25:57.176 --> 25:59.377
and a drugged up American suspect.

25:59.379 --> 26:01.746
That's true. It's not up
to the Mexican authorities

26:01.748 --> 26:02.847
to prove what we believe,

26:02.849 --> 26:05.049
which is Reid is being framed.

26:05.051 --> 26:07.318
They're only looking at who
and what's in front of them.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.787
Ok, but we can't let
him get stuck there.

26:09.789 --> 26:11.756
Then we better hope they
come up with something useful

26:11.758 --> 26:13.324
from this cognitive.

26:17.196 --> 26:19.722
It's a good sign things are coming back.

26:21.134 --> 26:24.702
Ok, so you remember landing in Houston,

26:24.704 --> 26:27.138
but you haven't said how
you got across the border.

26:38.851 --> 26:41.346
I took a bus to Brownsville.

26:44.424 --> 26:46.257
And walked across.

26:48.061 --> 26:50.427
Is that where you met Rosa?

26:51.764 --> 26:53.397
The first time.

26:56.536 --> 27:00.294
This trip we met in a motel.

27:05.678 --> 27:08.758
Because she doesn't have an office here.

27:10.616 --> 27:12.083
If you'd met Rosa before,

27:12.085 --> 27:14.752
why did you write her name on your arm?

27:16.089 --> 27:18.889
I don't know. I don't know.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.294
Well, it's a good thing you did.

27:23.296 --> 27:25.845
Otherwise we may not have found her.

27:26.065 --> 27:28.499
Maybe that would have been a good thing.

27:28.501 --> 27:31.500
Eventually her body would
have been discovered.

27:31.971 --> 27:35.373
When did you first meet her?

27:41.381 --> 27:42.713
Houston.

27:42.715 --> 27:46.050
I met her at Houston and at the clinic.

27:46.052 --> 27:50.764
She wrote an article on Alzheimer's.

27:52.091 --> 27:53.758
And that's why I came here.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.328
Ok. That's the most
cognizant you've been,

27:57.330 --> 27:59.430
so let's focus on that.

27:59.432 --> 28:03.179
It's time to close your eyes.

28:03.569 --> 28:06.175
Ok, tell me about her.

28:08.141 --> 28:10.207
She had the vials.

28:10.209 --> 28:16.514
She said that my mom
just needed 3 drops a day.

28:16.516 --> 28:19.383
And I thanked her.

28:19.385 --> 28:24.055
Then something... Something went wrong.

28:24.057 --> 28:27.425
She was upset, and
we were at the window.

28:27.427 --> 28:30.394
What was it? Was someone else there?

28:30.396 --> 28:31.829
Yeah.

28:31.831 --> 28:34.065
Ok, can you see them?

28:34.067 --> 28:37.234
No. No.

28:37.236 --> 28:39.512
The door opened.

28:41.808 --> 28:44.141
They must have knocked me out,

28:44.143 --> 28:47.945
'cause I don't... I know
that I was on the floor.

28:47.947 --> 28:51.382
I can't... can't remember.
Can't remember anything.

28:51.384 --> 28:54.251
I can't remember anything.
I can't remember anything.

28:54.253 --> 28:55.586
She...

29:00.660 --> 29:03.227
Rosa's on the floor, too, though.

29:03.229 --> 29:07.431
And... someone else is definitely there.

29:07.433 --> 29:09.967
- There's a knife.
- Aah!

29:09.969 --> 29:11.669
There's a knife and
there's a lot of blood.

29:11.671 --> 29:12.803
Who has the knife?

29:12.805 --> 29:15.039
Who is stabbing Rosa?

29:15.041 --> 29:16.107
I don't know.

29:16.109 --> 29:17.174
It's in my hand.

29:17.176 --> 29:18.442
You're trying to stop the killer.

29:18.444 --> 29:19.743
Mm-hmm.

29:19.745 --> 29:21.512
I think so.

29:25.852 --> 29:27.384
Reid.

29:27.386 --> 29:29.186
Reid.

29:29.188 --> 29:33.290
Ok. Let's... let's take a break, ok?

29:37.196 --> 29:40.229
We need to get you cleaned up.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.913
How's he doing?

29:55.915 --> 29:57.815
He's made some breakthroughs,

29:57.817 --> 30:01.318
but I'm not sure how helpful they'll be.

30:03.122 --> 30:06.023
What is it?

30:06.025 --> 30:10.127
They just charged Reid with
the murder of Nadie Ramos.

30:22.201 --> 30:24.768
We can't get him out of here, can we?

30:24.770 --> 30:26.704
I don't know how.

30:26.706 --> 30:29.673
He didn't kill her.

30:29.675 --> 30:32.376
If all I had to go on was the evidence,

30:32.378 --> 30:33.694
I would swear he did.

30:34.126 --> 30:36.827
But knowing Reid,
hearing the cognitive...

30:36.829 --> 30:41.998
Yes, he said there was another
person in that motel room, but...

30:42.000 --> 30:44.868
Who has the knife?

30:44.870 --> 30:46.403
Who is stabbing Rosa?

30:46.405 --> 30:48.672
I don't know.

30:48.674 --> 30:50.474
It's in my hand.

30:50.476 --> 30:53.043
You're trying to stop the killer.

30:53.045 --> 30:56.847
Right now this is just
more evidence against him.

31:00.386 --> 31:04.287
Ok, I am obsessively refreshing
the Mexican prison logs,

31:04.289 --> 31:05.922
and so far Reid is staying put.

31:05.924 --> 31:07.991
But they could transfer
him to Santa Adaladia

31:07.993 --> 31:10.127
or El Diablo, both of which

31:10.129 --> 31:11.962
make Matamoros look like a day spa.

31:11.964 --> 31:13.163
Like a who's who of bad guys.

31:13.165 --> 31:14.598
Crazy rough, really overcrowded.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.566
There's assaults and
murders on inmates monthly.

31:16.568 --> 31:19.770
He's an American, accused of
murdering a Mexican citizen.

31:19.772 --> 31:21.838
The government is well within
their rights to keep him there.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.206
Well, they could do worse.

31:23.208 --> 31:24.674
They could lock him up
and throw away the key.

31:24.676 --> 31:27.244
Look, the only thing we
know Reid is guilty of

31:27.246 --> 31:29.246
is getting the vials for his mother.

31:29.248 --> 31:31.915
Now maybe the drugs in
those vials weren't illegal.

31:31.917 --> 31:33.817
I hate to say it, but
they probably were.

31:33.819 --> 31:36.253
I mean, he couldn't get
whatever it is stateside.

31:36.255 --> 31:38.088
Or let's say it wasn't
an illegal substance,

31:38.090 --> 31:40.457
but whoever planted the
heroin in the trunk...

31:40.459 --> 31:42.793
Put something crazy
in the vials as well.

31:42.795 --> 31:44.261
Right.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.401
Reid is going to
El Diablo maximum security

31:48.401 --> 31:50.591
by the end of the day
They just put in the transfer.

32:16.345 --> 32:17.644
This is Prentiss.

32:17.646 --> 32:19.719
I'll be right there.

32:34.396 --> 32:36.396
Mom, don't do that!

32:36.398 --> 32:37.397
Don't do that! Stop it!

32:37.399 --> 32:38.398
Leave me alone! Stop!

32:38.400 --> 32:40.167
Stop! Give it back to me!

32:40.169 --> 32:42.369
Oh! Stay away from me!

32:42.371 --> 32:44.671
Ohh! Aah!

32:44.673 --> 32:46.540
For God's sake, leave me alone!

32:46.542 --> 32:48.508
Mom! Stop!

32:48.510 --> 32:49.610
Why did you do that?

32:49.612 --> 32:52.012
I hate that stuff and I hate you!

32:52.014 --> 32:55.215
Do you have any idea what I went
through to get that medicine?

32:55.217 --> 32:57.250
It can't be replaced.
To you realize that?

32:57.252 --> 32:59.119
Good! I want to go back home.

32:59.121 --> 33:00.454
- This is home.
- No, it isn't!

33:00.456 --> 33:02.623
I want to go back to where I was before.

33:02.625 --> 33:04.291
Uhh!

33:06.562 --> 33:07.961
Reid?

33:07.963 --> 33:09.363
A little good news.

33:09.365 --> 33:10.597
Backup is here.

33:10.599 --> 33:12.466
Hey, Spencer.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.388
Hey.

33:15.004 --> 33:16.703
Thank you for coming.

33:16.705 --> 33:17.941
Yeah, of course.

33:17.941 --> 33:20.341
Jack and me are finishing up a case
in Costa Rica,

33:20.341 --> 33:22.142
so we hopped on a commercial
plane to get here.

33:22.144 --> 33:25.010
We're trying to stop your
transfer to El Diablo.

33:25.180 --> 33:26.346
Do you think it's possible?

33:26.348 --> 33:29.483
Yes. Lab reports on the vials came back.

33:29.485 --> 33:32.019
Some of what was in there
hasn't been approved by the FDA,

33:32.021 --> 33:33.920
but there aren't any illegal substances.

33:33.922 --> 33:35.622
That's great news.

33:35.624 --> 33:38.392
Is there anything else you
remember about your time here?

33:38.394 --> 33:40.394
I remember what happened
to the vials at home.

33:40.396 --> 33:42.129
My mom threw most of them out.

33:42.131 --> 33:44.798
So that's why you
were here, to get more.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.966
It must be.

33:45.968 --> 33:47.167
Well, you're off the hook for that.

33:47.169 --> 33:48.735
There was no contraband involved.

33:48.737 --> 33:51.171
Yeah, but we were still
looking at the planted drug

33:51.173 --> 33:53.907
and murder charges, which could
keep you here for a long time.

33:53.909 --> 33:55.776
So what can we do to delay the transfer?

33:55.778 --> 33:59.212
You said that you met Nadie,

33:59.214 --> 34:01.915
who calls herself Rosa, in Houston.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.537
Why didn't she just give
you the vials in the U.S.?

34:05.487 --> 34:07.087
I don't know. I don't know.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.523
But she helped us and I trusted her.

34:09.525 --> 34:12.092
I was right to. I still believe that.

34:12.094 --> 34:15.395
Well, she convinced you to
cross the border multiple times.

34:15.397 --> 34:17.264
She had you risk your life.

34:17.266 --> 34:21.074
Because she must have had
something to lose, too.

34:21.402 --> 34:24.771
Like family.

34:24.773 --> 34:27.351
We need to know more about her.

34:28.577 --> 34:30.877
Well, what was in those vials?

34:30.879 --> 34:33.018
Yeah.

34:34.382 --> 34:38.217
There are some nootropic
compounds like Ampalex,

34:38.219 --> 34:40.020
uh, but also some
more natural stuff...

34:40.022 --> 34:42.322
Coral calcium, Jimson weed,

34:42.324 --> 34:45.792
coconut oil, a variety
of vitamins... B12, D3.

34:45.793 --> 34:46.760
Where are we right now?

34:46.762 --> 34:48.695
Matamoros, Northern Mexico.

34:48.697 --> 34:50.768
Jimson weed, otherwise
known as the Devil's snare,

34:50.768 --> 34:52.466
originated in Mexico, but
its natural growing region

34:52.467 --> 34:54.306
is further north or south of the border.

34:54.306 --> 34:55.601
Now, that sounds like you.

34:55.603 --> 34:57.070
So it isn't from here.

34:57.072 --> 34:58.538
Then where'd she get it?

34:58.540 --> 35:00.607
Garcia, we've got some questions.

35:00.609 --> 35:02.142
Hey, Penelope.

35:02.144 --> 35:03.810
Oh, my God.
It's the dulcet tones of Matt Simmons.

35:03.812 --> 35:05.178
Are you there to save the day?

35:05.180 --> 35:07.013
I'm trying. Clara's here, too.

35:07.015 --> 35:08.849
Knowing we have you guys as backup

35:08.851 --> 35:10.283
is providing me some much needed hope,

35:10.285 --> 35:11.918
and I work better this way.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.720
Hey, lady, we're trying
to catch up on a few things.

35:13.722 --> 35:14.755
Shoot it at me.

35:14.757 --> 35:16.690
Where is Nadie Ramos from?

35:16.692 --> 35:19.226
Mm, she lives with her family

35:19.228 --> 35:21.194
just north of Matamoros.

35:21.196 --> 35:23.530
That must be where she
got the Jimson weed.

35:24.798 --> 35:27.968
What's weird is she crosses
the border like a lot.

35:27.970 --> 35:29.269
Why?

35:29.271 --> 35:31.138
Well, she works at
that clinic in Houston.

35:31.140 --> 35:33.707
She also helps at a
local healthcare center.

35:33.709 --> 35:37.410
I can't find a visa on
her, which is double weird.

35:37.412 --> 35:39.379
And in finishing the weird trifecta,

35:39.381 --> 35:41.715
there's a social security
number on her W-2 form.

35:41.717 --> 35:44.618
Social security?
She's an American citizen?

35:44.620 --> 35:46.720
Yeah. She has dual citizenship.

35:46.722 --> 35:47.954
She was born in Houston,

35:47.956 --> 35:49.556
and her family had to
move back to Mexico.

35:49.558 --> 35:53.126
She lives with them and
she works in the U.S.

35:53.128 --> 35:56.062
Well, this changes everything and
we need to talk to the consulate.

35:56.064 --> 35:57.497
It's time for his transfer.

35:57.499 --> 35:58.899
We've had a break in the case.

35:58.901 --> 36:00.300
The victim was also American,

36:00.302 --> 36:01.568
and that calls for extradition.

36:01.570 --> 36:04.237
I've got orders. Sorry.

36:12.901 --> 36:15.001
With the victim having dual citizenship,

36:15.003 --> 36:17.103
we now have concurrent jurisdiction.

36:17.105 --> 36:19.472
It was my understanding
that the official order

36:19.474 --> 36:22.842
to extradite SSA Spencer Reid
would be evaluated.

36:22.844 --> 36:24.510
I understand. Thank you.

36:24.512 --> 36:27.046
They're taking it to their brass.
Go get him.

36:32.020 --> 36:33.653
Let's go.

36:36.725 --> 36:38.891
Hey, stop!

36:38.893 --> 36:41.527
We just got word that he's
under our jurisdiction.

36:41.529 --> 36:43.712
We'll be taking him back to the U.S. Ok?

36:47.268 --> 36:49.969
Ok, thanks.

36:55.977 --> 36:58.711
My old unit chief at BAP has a call in

36:58.713 --> 37:01.347
to the best legal counsel
the Bureau has to offer.

37:01.349 --> 37:02.582
We need a dream team.

37:02.584 --> 37:03.783
That's what we'll get.

37:03.785 --> 37:05.418
Cruz said we need Reid's work history,

37:05.420 --> 37:07.420
performance reviews,
commendations, and reprimands

37:07.422 --> 37:09.255
if there are any, and we need
them in the next 3 minutes.

37:09.257 --> 37:11.350
Garcia and I compiled
the list just in case.

37:11.350 --> 37:12.792
Done. It's sent.

37:12.794 --> 37:15.428
All right. Now we wait.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.203
We're working on all channels here.

37:24.205 --> 37:26.038
Matt Cruz is on with
the consulate right now.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.552
We could get an immediate extradition,
but it's just the beginning.

37:29.711 --> 37:31.477
I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.

37:31.479 --> 37:34.213
It was for the right reason.

37:34.215 --> 37:35.381
I don't know what happened,

37:35.383 --> 37:38.084
but I know I didn't kill anyone.

37:38.086 --> 37:39.185
We do, too.

37:39.187 --> 37:41.687
Hey. They approved the extradition.

37:41.689 --> 37:43.256
Effective immediately.

37:48.329 --> 37:50.563
You'll forgive me for
feeling like justice

37:50.565 --> 37:53.833
isn't exactly being
served with this move.

37:53.835 --> 37:55.301
I understand.

37:55.303 --> 37:57.403
But I can assure you this
has gone to the highest ranks

37:57.405 --> 37:59.505
and there will be a full investigation.

37:59.507 --> 38:01.007
Thank you for working with us.

38:01.009 --> 38:03.543
For our reports, I would like to have

38:03.545 --> 38:06.979
the recording of that
cognitive interview.

38:06.981 --> 38:09.311
I didn't record it.

38:09.717 --> 38:11.651
But that was our agreement.

38:11.653 --> 38:13.753
I determined he was
still under the influence.

38:13.755 --> 38:16.355
Anything he said wouldn't
have clarified matters.

38:19.027 --> 38:21.060
You're committed agents.

38:21.062 --> 38:24.096
And I've worked with the IRT before.

38:24.098 --> 38:26.532
I trust you know what you're doing.

38:26.534 --> 38:30.736
We do. I promise.

38:46.454 --> 38:48.387
Thanks for the ride home.

38:48.389 --> 38:49.922
Don't mention it.

38:49.924 --> 38:52.859
Commercial airlines kick
my ass nowadays. You?

38:52.861 --> 38:55.695
Once you've had the best,
it's hard to go back.

38:55.697 --> 38:57.797
I was just thanking
Clara for helping us.

38:57.799 --> 38:59.665
Yeah, and I told her,

38:59.667 --> 39:01.367
when one of us is in
trouble, we all are.

39:01.369 --> 39:03.469
You guys have any other
problems with this,

39:03.471 --> 39:04.770
we happen to know some people.

39:04.772 --> 39:06.539
Love that.

39:06.541 --> 39:08.941
I can't thank you enough.

39:08.943 --> 39:10.643
Hey, it's all good, man.

39:10.645 --> 39:13.779
I'm just glad you sound
like yourself again.

39:13.781 --> 39:15.014
Me, too.

39:15.016 --> 39:16.883
Ok, so here's the deal that Cruz made.

39:16.885 --> 39:19.518
We can stop by the BAU when we land,

39:19.520 --> 39:20.920
but then we'll drive
you into the district

39:20.922 --> 39:22.388
and take you to the federal jail.

39:22.390 --> 39:25.224
Since you are under
investigation for murder,

39:25.226 --> 39:29.128
these cuffs are going to have to
stay on until you are arraigned,

39:29.130 --> 39:31.464
but you're not a flight risk up here.

39:31.466 --> 39:32.665
Thank you.

39:32.667 --> 39:34.267
Circulation's a wonderful thing.

39:34.269 --> 39:37.069
And the moment there's a
chance for outside witnesses,

39:37.071 --> 39:38.404
these go back on.

39:38.406 --> 39:40.406
Have you talked to anyone
about the legal team?

39:40.408 --> 39:42.475
Yeah. Stephen Walker made some calls

39:42.477 --> 39:44.577
to the BAP to get the best we can.

39:44.579 --> 39:47.046
The BAP's a great group.
You'll be in good hands.

39:47.048 --> 39:50.349
Mark my words, kid.
This whole thing's been a nightmare,

39:50.351 --> 39:53.219
but we're gonna get you out of this.

39:58.326 --> 40:02.028
Prints and samples from the crime
scene came back to our home lab.

40:02.030 --> 40:05.197
They've found proof that
backs up your cognitive.

40:05.199 --> 40:08.234
There was a third person in that room.

40:08.236 --> 40:10.169
You're not out of the woods,

40:10.171 --> 40:11.971
but I swear we won't lose you.

40:28.990 --> 40:31.057
Hi.

40:32.060 --> 40:33.993
Oh.

40:33.995 --> 40:35.461
I'm so sorry.

40:35.463 --> 40:36.896
It's only because there
are other people around.

40:36.898 --> 40:38.097
It's ok.

40:38.099 --> 40:41.033
We know you didn't do anything wrong.

40:41.035 --> 40:44.637
But I should have told
you guys I was going there.

40:44.639 --> 40:46.872
I never... never imagined
in a million years

40:46.874 --> 40:48.641
it would have turned out like this.

40:48.643 --> 40:51.677
No one thought that
this could have happened.

40:51.679 --> 40:54.347
Look, you're not in this alone anymore.

40:54.349 --> 40:56.282
Ok? No secrets.

40:56.284 --> 40:57.283
Deal.

40:57.285 --> 40:59.151
My turn.

41:00.121 --> 41:01.887
Come here, you.

41:01.889 --> 41:03.622
Oh, my God.

41:03.624 --> 41:05.691
Your color's better.

41:05.693 --> 41:08.027
All I had to look at was that mug shot,

41:08.029 --> 41:09.228
and it had me really worried.

41:09.230 --> 41:10.863
Yeah, we all were.

41:10.865 --> 41:11.831
Glad you're back.

41:11.833 --> 41:12.798
Me, too.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.467
How's my mom doing?

41:14.469 --> 41:17.203
She's fine. You don't need
to worry about her, I promise.

41:17.205 --> 41:18.838
I can't help it.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.674
Trust me. Garcia had meals delivered
to your mom almost every night.

41:21.676 --> 41:25.578
And that nurse you
got is amazing... Cassie.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.046
Cassie, she's great.

41:27.048 --> 41:30.016
I brought the boys by.
Your mom really loved them.

41:30.018 --> 41:32.084
I bet she did.

41:32.086 --> 41:34.553
Uh, I just got a text.

41:34.555 --> 41:36.722
Reid isn't eligible for the
Bureau's legal assistance.

41:36.724 --> 41:38.190
What?

41:38.192 --> 41:39.592
He was never briefed.

41:39.594 --> 41:41.293
And he wasn't in Mexico
on government business.

41:41.295 --> 41:42.328
They won't represent him.

41:42.330 --> 41:43.863
Oh, God.

41:43.865 --> 41:45.331
We're on our own.

41:51.039 --> 41:54.373
“There are so many
fragile things after all.

41:54.375 --> 41:56.742
“People break so easily,

41:56.744 --> 41:59.745
and so do dreams and hearts.”

41:59.747 --> 42:01.313
