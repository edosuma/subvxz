12:17.904 --> 12:20.373
Now do you see why
Lydia has to do this?

12:20.406 --> 12:23.009
Cousin, I don’t see why
she has to do a TV show

12:23.043 --> 12:24.745
let alone play chess!

12:26.246 --> 12:27.848
She doesn’t have to play chess.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.115
Well, at least
you’re letting that go.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.017
‐Oh, why me?
‐It’s progress.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.519
‐Why me?
‐That’s progress.

12:32.553 --> 12:35.388
Balki, Lydia wants
to do a TV show!

12:35.421 --> 12:36.557
Oh, is that so?

12:36.590 --> 12:38.391
Then how come every time
she talks about it

12:38.424 --> 12:39.960
she gets so upset?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.027
Jitters!

12:41.061 --> 12:42.295
[gasps]
Where? Where!

12:42.328 --> 12:44.831
I hate those little bugs!

12:44.865 --> 12:46.833
Balki! Balki! Balki. Balki.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.137
Not chiggers.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.974
‐No?
‐No.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.075
Jitters.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.142
[sighs]

12:56.176 --> 12:58.845
She’ll get over it!

12:58.879 --> 13:00.881
Well, even if she do get over it

13:00.914 --> 13:02.282
I don’t think she want to do it.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.150
I think you’re just
making her do it

13:04.184 --> 13:06.152
because of this Bunky
in your pants.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.523
I am doing this
because I don’t want her

13:09.556 --> 13:11.157
to make the same mistake I did.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.226
Well, be that as that may be

13:13.259 --> 13:15.128
I’m going down
to that studio with her

13:15.161 --> 13:16.963
and the first time
I hear her say

13:16.997 --> 13:18.999
[imitates Lydia]
"I don’t wanna do this, Larry!"

13:19.032 --> 13:20.567
I’m taking her home

13:20.601 --> 13:23.570
[instrumental music]

13:37.050 --> 13:38.351
I still don’t understand.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.988
If it’s called "Lydia Live,"
why isn’t it live?

13:42.022 --> 13:45.491
Mary Anne, this is a pilot
for a television show.

13:45.526 --> 13:47.227
Now that means if this goes well

13:47.260 --> 13:49.229
then the real show will be live.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.065
Oh, you mean if it tests well

13:52.098 --> 13:54.067
and the demographics are good
they’ll give it a short order

13:54.100 --> 13:56.002
with a series of options
and Lydia could find herself

13:56.036 --> 13:58.238
in the middle of a very handsome
syndication package.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.145
I was once in an elevator
with Ted Turner.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.283
I’m gonna go make sure
Lydia is okay before the show.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.185
I’m going to go
make sure Lydia is okay

14:12.218 --> 14:14.154
after she talks to Cousin Larry.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.190
[indistinct chattering]

14:23.930 --> 14:25.231
Lydia?

14:25.265 --> 14:27.033
You look great.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.002
‐How’s everything going?
‐’Fine.’

14:29.035 --> 14:30.370
Fine.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.638
I’m fine.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.874
Everything’s fine.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.512
She sounds a little
too fine, cousin.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.515
Don’t be silly, she’s loving
every minute of it!

14:44.084 --> 14:45.586
Uh, we’re ready
when you are, Miss Markham.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.554
‐Am I ready Larry?
‐Yes, you are.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.391
We’d better take our seats.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.159
Lydia?

14:53.193 --> 14:54.561
Have fun with it.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.234
(male #1)
’Tape is rolling!’

15:01.267 --> 15:03.537
(male #2 on PA)
’Live from our studios
in the Pfister Building’

15:03.570 --> 15:05.271
’in downtown Chicago’

15:05.305 --> 15:07.674
’It’s time for your favorite
advice columnist’

15:07.708 --> 15:10.410
’the lady who’s never
at a loss for words...’

15:10.443 --> 15:13.113
’...h‐e‐e‐ere’s Lydia!

15:13.146 --> 15:15.081
[audience clapping]

15:17.117 --> 15:20.186
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Lydia Markham

15:20.220 --> 15:22.723
and welcome to "Lydia Live."

15:22.756 --> 15:24.490
[audience clapping]

15:25.592 --> 15:27.561
What did I tell you
she’s a natural.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.298
I’m gonna start off
today’s show by say‐i‐i‐ing...

15:34.300 --> 15:36.269
By say‐i‐i‐ing...

15:38.304 --> 15:40.574
Get away from me.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.043
Go on! Get away! Get...

15:43.076 --> 15:45.045
[screaming]

15:51.117 --> 15:53.053
Wow! She does her own stunts.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.056
[instrumental music]

15:56.089 --> 15:58.291
Miss Markham? Are you okay?

15:58.324 --> 16:00.561
Am I okay?
I’m breathing in a bag!

16:02.395 --> 16:03.697
She’s fine. She’s fine.

16:03.730 --> 16:07.568
It’s just an acting technique.
She uses it to clear her head.

16:07.601 --> 16:09.570
Okay, uh, we’ll start
as soon as you’re ready.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.175
Come on, Miss Lydia,
I packed all your things.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.442
We’re going home now.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.578
‐Come on...
‐Whoa! Wait a minute.

16:17.611 --> 16:20.013
Wait, wait, wait!

16:20.046 --> 16:22.015
Nobody’s going anywhere.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.550
Cousin, you said
that if Miss Lydia

16:23.584 --> 16:26.219
didn’t want to do the show
we could take her home.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.253
I promised if she said

16:27.287 --> 16:30.223
"I don’t want to
do the show, <i>Larry!"</i>

16:30.256 --> 16:31.592
Then I’d take her home.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.795
But she still wants to do
the show, don’t you, Lydia?

16:34.828 --> 16:37.130
I don’t want to do
the show Larry!

16:37.531 --> 16:38.732
Uh‐ha!

16:39.800 --> 16:42.368
She didn’t mean it. She’s fine.

16:42.402 --> 16:46.372
Cousin, how can you say
she’s fine? Look at her.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.808
Her eyes are bloodshot

16:47.841 --> 16:50.410
her face is losing color
and she’s retaining water.

16:53.714 --> 16:56.783
It’s just a minor case
of stage fright.

16:56.817 --> 16:59.385
She can get through it.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.155
No she can’t
and she don’t have to!

17:02.756 --> 17:04.357
Yes, she does.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.593
‐No, she don’t.
‐Yes, she does!

17:06.627 --> 17:08.228
‐No, she don’t!
‐Yes, she does!

17:08.261 --> 17:10.063
‐No, she don’t!
‐Okay, she don’t!

17:10.096 --> 17:11.565
‐She don’t?
‐’No, she don’t.’

17:16.670 --> 17:18.505
She shouldn’t have to do it
if she doesn’t want to do it.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.674
Come on, Lydia,
why don’t you sit down

17:20.707 --> 17:23.810
over here while Balki
and I go get the car?

17:23.844 --> 17:25.145
‐Come on, Balki.
‐No, cousin I‐‐

17:25.178 --> 17:26.246
‐Let’s go get the car.
‐Cousin, I‐‐

17:26.279 --> 17:28.381
Let’s go get the car.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.584
Well, but, cousin,
the‐the parking lot

17:30.617 --> 17:31.785
is over that way.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.787
Yes, but I know
a secret shortcut.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.526
I like secrets.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.795
I know you do.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.396
‐Come on, it’s over here.
‐I...

17:43.429 --> 17:46.266
Let me show you. Let me show
you. Come on.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.068
[indistinct chattering]

17:52.138 --> 17:54.074
[instrumental music]

17:59.212 --> 18:00.647
Larry, are you alright?

18:00.681 --> 18:02.415
Oh, everything’s fine.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.385
Where’s Balki?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.788
He’s backstage...resting.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.527
Larry, are you sure
Lydia can go on?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.795
Oh, are you kidding?

18:14.828 --> 18:16.763
She begged me
to let her try again.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.700
(male #1)
’Standby.’

18:19.733 --> 18:22.368
(male #2 on PA)
’H‐e‐e‐ere’s Lydia!’

18:22.402 --> 18:24.337
[audience clapping]

18:25.806 --> 18:27.874
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:27.908 --> 18:32.378
My name is Lydia Markham
and welcome to "Lydia Live."

18:32.412 --> 18:34.347
[clapping]

18:35.549 --> 18:37.884
For many years
I have been a n‐n‐n...

18:39.185 --> 18:42.122
...nationally
syndicated communist.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.927
She’s going down, Larry.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.461
[laughing]
Where is Balki?

18:48.494 --> 18:50.230
He told me
I didn’t have to do this.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.464
He told me
that he would take me home!

18:51.497 --> 18:52.933
Balki, are you out there?

18:52.966 --> 18:54.334
It’s time to take me home!

18:54.367 --> 18:56.570
[Lydia laughing]

18:56.603 --> 18:57.671
(Lydia)
’Oh!’

19:00.240 --> 19:01.374
Oh...

19:03.544 --> 19:05.912
[screams]

19:05.946 --> 19:07.614
Miss Lydia,
you don’t have to do this!

19:07.648 --> 19:09.650
Oh, Balki, thank you.

19:09.683 --> 19:11.618
Thank you, thank you!

19:12.753 --> 19:14.721
I‐is this what
you were wearing earlier?

19:16.723 --> 19:18.458
Balki, w‐what are you doing?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.860
Lydia was doing great!

19:19.893 --> 19:21.494
She was just
starting to warm up.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.930
What do you say, Lydia?
One more try?

19:23.964 --> 19:25.632
Drop dead, Larry.

19:26.767 --> 19:29.736
Balki, I want you
to take me home.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.874
[instrumental music]

19:39.613 --> 19:41.648
I’m still getting
her answering machine.

19:41.682 --> 19:44.284
All it says is "This is Lydia
Markham. I’m not here right now.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.787
I’m on a remote island
where there are no c‐a‐aameras."

19:51.357 --> 19:53.226
Do you think
she’ll ever forgive me?

19:53.259 --> 19:56.730
Well, I forgave you
for taping me up like King Toot.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.835
Good morning, everyone.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.838
Oh, Lydia. Lydia,
I am so very sorry.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.507
I am so, so sorry.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.575
I should never have
forced you to do something

20:08.609 --> 20:10.310
you didn’t want to do.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.645
Can you ever forgive me?

20:11.678 --> 20:14.548
Larry, dear, please, relax.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.283
I forgive you.
I’m over it, really.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.519
You are?

20:18.552 --> 20:20.420
Let’s just put this behind us.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.856
It was a bad
experience but...

20:22.889 --> 20:24.591
...I’m stronger because of it.

20:29.530 --> 20:31.464
[screams]

20:34.968 --> 20:36.770
I think I’ll take the stairs.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.471
I need the exercise.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.682
Balki...

20:48.715 --> 20:51.918
...how could I
have gotten so carried away?

20:51.952 --> 20:54.621
Well, cousin, you do get
plenty of practice at it.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.592
But I really meant well!

20:58.625 --> 21:00.493
I only wanted
to spare her the pain

21:00.527 --> 21:03.597
of a missed opportunity
and a life of regret.

21:03.630 --> 21:04.865
Like mine.

21:05.799 --> 21:06.867
Uh‐oh.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.771
We’re back
to Binky McDinky, aren’t we?

21:13.106 --> 21:14.875
Bunky McDermott

21:14.908 --> 21:18.378
became president
of my high school chess club

21:18.411 --> 21:20.581
and one of the wealthiest men
in the country.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.483
He took an opportunity
that should have been mine

21:23.517 --> 21:25.852
and he is living a life
that I should be living.

21:25.886 --> 21:27.087
Now, wait a minute.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.556
What is wrong
with Larry Appleton’s life?

21:29.590 --> 21:32.058
Aren’t you doing a job
you’ve always wanted to do?

21:33.594 --> 21:34.761
Yes.

21:34.795 --> 21:36.863
And don’t you have
wonderful friends?

21:36.897 --> 21:37.864
Yes.

21:37.898 --> 21:40.333
And aren’t you dating
the girl of your dreams?

21:40.366 --> 21:41.635
Oh, yes.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.036
Well, from where I’m standing

21:43.069 --> 21:46.773
you look like Larry Appleton,
young man on the move.

21:46.807 --> 21:49.776
[instrumental music]

21:50.944 --> 21:53.013
I am doing pretty well,
aren’t I?

21:53.046 --> 21:57.017
Cousin, I think it’s time
you said bye bye to Boinki.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.320
Come on, get him out here.

22:01.722 --> 22:03.456
Alright. You’re right.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.392
Bunky McDermott...

22:06.426 --> 22:09.362
...I wish you the best
of luck in your life...

22:09.395 --> 22:11.632
but it’s time
to get out of mine.

22:16.069 --> 22:18.471
[laughing]

22:18.505 --> 22:21.708
Balki, I feel released.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.510
Cleansed!

22:23.544 --> 22:24.678
Free!

22:24.711 --> 22:26.680
Do you feel poor?

22:28.114 --> 22:29.516
No, why?

22:29.550 --> 22:31.484
’Cause you just
tore up your paycheck.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.856
[instrumental music]

22:41.762 --> 22:44.364
[theme music]

23:11.157 --> 23:14.127
[music continues]
