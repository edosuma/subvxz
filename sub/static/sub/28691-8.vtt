WEBVTT

00:08.951 --> 00:10.859
Why is it so hot in here?

00:13.007 --> 00:15.303
Please tell me that's not
our air conditioner.

00:15.328 --> 00:17.500
- Dad?
- Hey, guys.

00:17.781 --> 00:20.830
This is your AC condenser
from out back.

00:20.855 --> 00:21.877
Zoe asked me to swing by

00:21.909 --> 00:24.227
and check on the place while
she's on vacation and

00:24.252 --> 00:27.144
I could hear this baby
chugging from a mile away.

00:27.192 --> 00:30.322
- So you decided to take it apart?
- I'm fixing it.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.650
We should call a repair guy.

00:31.675 --> 00:33.282
- Yeah.
- And why?

00:33.307 --> 00:36.017
Have him charge you an arm
and a leg to tighten up

00:36.042 --> 00:39.603
a couple of screws? Nah, I'll
have this baby fixed in no time.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.510
Well, the good news is,
it's the end of the day.

00:43.535 --> 00:45.369
How could it possibly get any worse?

00:45.394 --> 00:48.821
Ooh! There they are, right there!

00:48.846 --> 00:50.635
There they are! My two favorite Pls!

00:50.660 --> 00:51.666
In the house!

00:51.691 --> 00:53.103
- Conroy?
- Hey,

00:53.128 --> 00:55.221
is it hot in here or is it just me?

00:55.384 --> 00:58.108
- Who is Mr. Margaritaville?
- Dad,

00:58.133 --> 01:00.470
this is Deputy Eddie Conroy.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.901
We met him last year
up at Preston Hall.

01:02.926 --> 01:04.370
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

01:04.396 --> 01:08.518
We all solved a murder together.
It was pretty awesome.

01:09.086 --> 01:10.979
Maybe not for the dead guy.

01:11.373 --> 01:13.729
Probably the victim's
husband, too, and...

01:13.824 --> 01:15.799
not very fun for any of
the hotel guests who...

01:15.824 --> 01:18.050
Conroy, what brings
you to the big city?

01:18.075 --> 01:20.454
OK. I got a case for you guys.

01:20.479 --> 01:21.675
Darn.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.980
- We are totally slammed right now.
- Totally slammed.

01:24.005 --> 01:25.301
- You are?
- Yep.

01:25.326 --> 01:26.411
Slammed.

01:26.436 --> 01:29.691
Right. Yeah, I should have supposed.

01:29.716 --> 01:32.283
I mean, you guys are the best, so...

01:32.884 --> 01:35.839
OK, well, very nice to meet
you, and sorry to bother you.

01:35.864 --> 01:37.496
OK.

01:39.887 --> 01:41.947
Wait, wait.

01:43.652 --> 01:45.230
What's going on, Conroy?

01:45.255 --> 01:46.816
OK. Let me tell you

01:46.841 --> 01:48.941
about Estelle Warren.
80-year-old woman,

01:48.966 --> 01:52.683
has this cozy little cabin on the
outside of town, in the woods.

01:52.708 --> 01:56.472
- She was robbed?
- No, no, no... She lived alone,

01:56.497 --> 01:58.130
she had a bad hip,

01:58.155 --> 02:00.130
had trouble getting down
the lane to get her mail.

02:00.155 --> 02:01.888
I used to go by once a
week with the mail...

02:01.913 --> 02:03.044
OK, hold up.

02:03.677 --> 02:06.357
Why are you speaking in the past tense?
Did something happen to her?

02:06.381 --> 02:08.982
Yes, yes, absolutely.
She was murdered.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.809
And I think it was my fault.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074

02:51.543 --> 02:53.465
- When you tune in next week,

02:53.490 --> 02:56.559
I'll explain how this boat

02:57.151 --> 02:59.989
and this notorious murderer

03:00.014 --> 03:01.559
are connected.

03:01.584 --> 03:04.348
Is that Jack the Ripper? Because
I always thought that...

03:04.373 --> 03:06.793
Shh. This part is really important.

03:06.818 --> 03:09.983
I have been revealing too
many truths, haven't I?

03:10.253 --> 03:11.841
Who have I pissed off?

03:14.495 --> 03:18.595
Hey... I saw your brown truck

03:18.620 --> 03:20.961
parked on the street the other night

03:20.986 --> 03:23.681
in front of my house.

03:25.234 --> 03:28.052
This was the last vlog she ever made.

03:28.077 --> 03:33.243
See, in the Titanic movie,
Leo's name was Jack.

03:33.268 --> 03:37.489
- Keep going, Conroy.
- A week before she died,

03:37.781 --> 03:41.248
Estelle told me about this brown truck.

03:41.273 --> 03:43.433
I mean, she was always going
on about conspiracy stuff,

03:43.457 --> 03:45.297
so I didn't take her seriously.

03:45.322 --> 03:47.536
- And then, she was murdered?
- Yeah.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.340
No. I mean, I don't know.

03:50.365 --> 03:54.338
My Sergeant found Estelle in her
garage with her car running.

03:54.439 --> 03:56.245
It was ruled a suicide.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.505
- That's tough, man. I'm sorry.
- Nah, look...

03:58.530 --> 04:02.232
I refuse to believe that
she took her own life.

04:02.257 --> 04:04.504
If I'd just listened to her
about that brown truck,

04:04.529 --> 04:06.870
she could still be alive right now.

04:07.757 --> 04:09.835
This is why I need you
guys to help me with this.

04:09.860 --> 04:13.303
You want us to investigate
a murder up in...

04:13.328 --> 04:15.261
- Willowton.
- Willowton.

04:15.286 --> 04:18.128
But Estelle's grandniece lives here.
Maybe she knows something?

04:18.153 --> 04:20.576
I think her name is Maude.

04:20.601 --> 04:23.015
And I've got the license
plate number for the truck.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.128
Why didn't you run the plate yourself?

04:25.153 --> 04:26.865
Yes, right. About that.

04:26.890 --> 04:29.836
I was, suspended.

04:30.659 --> 04:32.410
Conroy.

04:32.435 --> 04:35.410
I know. Boss was fed up about
the fact that I wouldn't

04:35.435 --> 04:36.654
let it be,

04:36.679 --> 04:40.056
and then I ordered an
autopsy behind her back.

04:40.081 --> 04:43.161
She suspended me before it came
through. Look. You guys are

04:43.186 --> 04:47.726
the only people I know that can
help me with this, so... please.

04:48.444 --> 04:50.954
Just one second.

04:53.613 --> 04:56.683
- So, what do you think?
- No.

04:57.239 --> 04:58.971
- Don't you feel bad for him?
- Yes.

04:58.996 --> 05:01.728
Which is why we can't humour
this wild goose chase.

05:01.753 --> 05:04.187
You know your air flow
regulator is shot, right?

05:04.212 --> 05:07.235
- Yes, I know.
- Cool.

05:07.727 --> 05:10.169
OK, fine. Take him around for the
day, then go buy him a beer.

05:10.194 --> 05:12.278
- I'll look into the niece.
- OK, but I was thinking

05:12.303 --> 05:15.971
maybe you could take him around
and I will go see the... niece.

05:17.694 --> 05:19.537
Guess that means no.

05:27.794 --> 05:30.245
So this isn't one of those
real Porsches?

05:30.270 --> 05:33.372
This is one of those fake kit things?

05:33.980 --> 05:36.679
- It's a real Porsche.
- Yeah?

05:36.704 --> 05:39.488
That's cool. That's pretty cool.

05:39.749 --> 05:42.495
- I drive a Corolla myself.
- Corolla?

05:42.520 --> 05:46.678
Wow. That's a... reliable car.

05:46.703 --> 05:49.257
You can say that again.
Seventeen faithful years

05:49.282 --> 05:51.538
and counting, my friend.

05:57.373 --> 06:00.897
Look. Thanks again?
Not everybody, um...

06:01.235 --> 06:03.458
really takes me that seriously.

06:03.483 --> 06:05.392
It's no problem, man.

06:05.957 --> 06:08.430
I can tell Estelle meant a lot to you.

06:09.407 --> 06:11.697
Hey, when we're done with this,

06:12.095 --> 06:14.885
what're the chances you'd let
me take this baby for a spin?

06:14.910 --> 06:17.149
- Zero.
- OK.

06:20.017 --> 06:23.539
Wow! Wow!

06:23.564 --> 06:25.594
Look at this place! Whoo!

06:25.619 --> 06:29.246
- First time in a police station?
- No, no, not me. I'm a cop.

06:29.271 --> 06:32.294
- Is Maz here?
- He's on a training session.

06:32.362 --> 06:34.670
You know what would be great?

06:34.695 --> 06:37.443
If you could look up a
license plate number for us.

06:37.468 --> 06:38.907
I've got it right here.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.015
Didn't you just say you were a cop?

06:42.446 --> 06:43.994
Yeah, I did.

06:44.019 --> 06:46.872
- Inspector Carson!
- What's going on here?

06:46.897 --> 06:49.770
I can tell you. Shade
and Everett are looking

06:49.795 --> 06:53.689
into a lead about the murder
of my friend Estelle.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.347
Nice to meet you. I'm
Deputy Eddie Conroy.

06:56.372 --> 06:58.911
- Murder?
- Possible murder.

06:58.936 --> 07:02.198
Highly unlikely murder.
We're helping our...

07:02.223 --> 07:04.475
very special friend Eddie.

07:04.703 --> 07:07.440
Eddie just lost someone
very special to him.

07:07.465 --> 07:09.141
Hey, no. That's private.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.787
He's struggling with acceptance.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.776
I'm going around the
corner to yell at someone.

07:15.801 --> 07:19.013
When I come back, don't be here.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.291
I believe that was her way
of turning a blind eye.

07:26.316 --> 07:29.427
How come someone in Willowton
isn't looking into this?

07:29.452 --> 07:33.031
Not many of us at the station.
It's a pretty small town.

07:33.056 --> 07:35.829
I've got the number for you right here.

07:39.754 --> 07:41.662
OK, well, there's nothing coming up

07:41.687 --> 07:43.544
with a brown truck under
this license plate.

07:43.569 --> 07:45.832
Well, I appreciate you
honestly taking a look...

07:45.857 --> 07:47.445
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

07:47.470 --> 07:50.040
Can you run that plate again
with different colours?

07:50.065 --> 07:52.669
I just totally forgot

07:52.974 --> 07:55.372
that Estelle was completely colourblind.

07:55.397 --> 07:59.314
So you might want to try
blue and red, maybe.

07:59.524 --> 08:02.793
Also, Estelle's pretty
significantly dyslexic,

08:02.818 --> 08:06.430
so these letters could
very well be wrong.

08:07.213 --> 08:09.808
I'll give you a couple suggestions.
Um...

08:10.174 --> 08:12.836
So just that I'm clear,

08:12.861 --> 08:16.378
we're just shooting aimlessly
here and hoping for a bullseye?

08:16.403 --> 08:18.236
That pretty much covers it.

08:18.261 --> 08:21.648
OK, try that out.

08:24.246 --> 08:26.489
Nope, not that one.

08:31.513 --> 08:34.364
Well, there is a blue pick-up truck
that matches this plate number.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.251
It's registered to a towing
company out in Scarborough.

08:37.277 --> 08:39.727
8356...

08:39.953 --> 08:42.092
Commission Road South.

08:42.486 --> 08:45.282
- I knew it!
- Yeah, we gotta go.

08:47.633 --> 08:49.550
Inspector.

08:57.272 --> 08:59.991
Air conditioning.

09:00.383 --> 09:02.880
You must be Angie. Fiona.

09:02.905 --> 09:04.337
Fiona?

09:04.362 --> 09:06.972
Deputy Conroy said your name was Maude.

09:07.015 --> 09:08.396
Deputy Conroy?

09:08.421 --> 09:10.912
The police officer who was
friends with your great-aunt?

09:10.937 --> 09:14.178
Right. He's a funny
little man, that one.

09:14.203 --> 09:17.037
I'm still trying to wrap my
brain around all of this.

09:17.062 --> 09:18.234
Aunt Estelle was a kook,

09:18.259 --> 09:20.861
but I didn't think she
was capable of...

09:21.111 --> 09:23.567
taking her own life. It's thanks to her

09:23.592 --> 09:26.104
that I was able to start my
catering business, actually.

09:26.129 --> 09:27.892
Did she leave you
money in her will?

09:27.917 --> 09:30.490
No, before that. She
sent me $2,000 a month

09:30.515 --> 09:33.538
to keep me going until
we got up on our feet.

09:33.563 --> 09:35.512
Wow. That's quite the allowance.

09:35.670 --> 09:38.099
Aunt Estelle was incredibly generous.

09:38.124 --> 09:40.360
Do you have any idea where
the money was coming from?

09:40.385 --> 09:42.385
I assumed her savings?

09:42.410 --> 09:45.447
Didn't have any kids or a
partner to give it to.

09:46.856 --> 09:49.639
And actually, she increased
the cheques to 2,600 a month

09:49.664 --> 09:50.943
a little while ago.

09:50.968 --> 09:53.358
- Did she say why?
- No.

09:53.491 --> 09:55.688
Now that I think about it,

09:55.713 --> 09:58.039
maybe she was planning this.

09:58.232 --> 10:01.424
Don't people usually give things away

10:01.449 --> 10:05.027
- before they...?
- Yeah. Did Estelle have any friends?

10:05.052 --> 10:06.137
Not really.

10:06.162 --> 10:08.659
There was a name she'd mention
every once in a while.

10:08.930 --> 10:11.559
Betty Love. I think I
have her email address.

10:11.584 --> 10:13.298
Great.

10:31.009 --> 10:33.104
Anybody home?

10:34.553 --> 10:36.624
It's abandoned.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.829
Glad we came. How about we go
get that beer? It's on me.

10:39.854 --> 10:42.137
There's a great pub
right near the agency.

10:45.463 --> 10:47.477
Good God, no.

10:49.256 --> 10:51.014
That's fresh oil.

10:52.047 --> 10:54.554
- That's fresh oil.
- Seriously?

10:54.781 --> 10:57.792
You think you're gonna follow an
oil trail and find a blue truck?

10:57.817 --> 10:59.972
This isn't Scooby-Doo, man.

11:05.608 --> 11:07.291
Boo-yah!

11:07.316 --> 11:09.725
Whoa, whoa, just calm down,

11:09.750 --> 11:11.961
Don Ho. Let's examine the facts.

11:11.986 --> 11:15.513
A, this truck is a different colour
than the one Estelle described,

11:15.538 --> 11:18.426
and B, that license plate
is a different number

11:18.451 --> 11:20.835
than the one that was written
down in Estelle's journal.

11:20.860 --> 11:24.491
Hey! Who are you guys?

11:24.516 --> 11:27.174
I'm Deputy Conroy, Willowton Police.

11:27.263 --> 11:30.033
We're just looking at this truck
here which might be involved

11:30.058 --> 11:32.952
in a murder case.

11:33.245 --> 11:35.980
Wow, you just give it all
away for free, don't you?

11:36.005 --> 11:37.502
Could we, um,

11:37.527 --> 11:40.281
talk to the owner of
this fine establishment?

11:40.577 --> 11:43.563
OK, just let me make a phone call.

11:46.755 --> 11:50.424
Betty Love? I'm Angie Everett,
private investigator.

11:51.355 --> 11:53.063
I can come back later.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.496
Well, you'll be waiting
for quite a while.

11:55.521 --> 11:56.854
I'm training for a marathon.

11:58.232 --> 12:00.721
So you wanted to talk about Estelle?

12:00.746 --> 12:03.067
Yes. That must have
come as quite a shock.

12:03.092 --> 12:04.590
When you get to my age,

12:04.615 --> 12:07.453
you have to just gain a
certain amount of acceptance.

12:07.622 --> 12:10.957
My friend Rosemary died six weeks
ago from that terrible flu

12:10.982 --> 12:15.212
that was going around.
Just have to keep moving.

12:16.525 --> 12:19.987
I'm not sure if you're aware,
but the cops who found Estelle,

12:20.012 --> 12:23.124
they... they believe
she committed suicide.

12:23.149 --> 12:25.209
And you want to know
if that's possible.

12:27.110 --> 12:30.084
Well, she said she never
wanted to be a burden.

12:31.601 --> 12:35.234
I could see maybe if she was
diagnosed with something terminal,

12:35.259 --> 12:38.015
she might take things into
her own hands, but...

12:38.040 --> 12:41.386
- Do you know if that was true?
- She never said anything to me.

12:41.411 --> 12:44.171
OK, well, thank you.
I'll see myself out.

12:46.237 --> 12:48.683
One more thing. Do you
happen to know of anyone

12:48.708 --> 12:50.708
related to Estelle by
the name of Maude?

12:50.733 --> 12:53.464
Maude? No. No, never heard the name.

12:57.707 --> 13:01.268
What is up with this guy? My
spidey senses are going off.

13:01.293 --> 13:03.327
You know, I never had those.

13:03.912 --> 13:06.597
Yeah, OK. Yeah, he's around back, guys.

13:06.622 --> 13:09.229
Just set down back there.
He's expecting ya.

13:09.254 --> 13:11.713
Just around the corner.
Be right with ya.

13:14.153 --> 13:16.109
Don't answer that.

13:16.594 --> 13:19.929
Aw, shoot. Not you shoot...
I meant, you know, shoot...

13:19.954 --> 13:22.407
OK, shut up. Just throw
the phone on the ground.

13:22.432 --> 13:26.265
- Wallet, bag, car keys.
- Look, man, we can talk about this...

13:27.323 --> 13:30.031
Get in the shipping
container, both of you. Now!

13:34.890 --> 13:36.757
Hey, it's me. I'm just checking in.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.487
I haven't come up with much on my end.

13:38.512 --> 13:41.109
I'm calling it a night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:41.586 --> 13:44.951
Look, man, we can just walk away
and not tell anybody about this...

13:44.976 --> 13:46.627
- OK.
- Or we can get in the container.

13:46.652 --> 13:48.634
Entirely up to you.

13:55.359 --> 13:58.213
My gosh! I was right, wasn't I?

13:58.607 --> 14:01.021
It WAS a murder!

14:09.490 --> 14:10.849
Hello?

14:12.599 --> 14:15.549
Yeesh. It's hotter
than Trinidad in here.

14:15.574 --> 14:17.377
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.131
OK, I'm on it.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.114
See I got the parts

14:23.139 --> 14:26.974
and I found a manual online
that should speed things up.

14:26.999 --> 14:30.768
Good. Don, this is in Spanish.

14:30.793 --> 14:35.395
- I know. It's all I could find.
- Hey, have you heard from Shade?

14:35.420 --> 14:37.656
No, I don't think he
came home last night.

14:38.049 --> 14:41.309
I figured he was out late
with you working a case.

14:41.334 --> 14:44.349
No. No, I called his phone, it
went straight to voicemail.

14:44.990 --> 14:47.184
You know what? I'm gonna
head downtown, talk to Maz,

14:47.209 --> 14:49.507
see if he knows where
Shade and Conroy are.

14:49.532 --> 14:51.870
- And I'm gonna get started on this.
- Great.

14:57.790 --> 15:00.258
What time is it?

15:00.283 --> 15:02.990
- Ten after eight.
- Man!

15:03.563 --> 15:05.305
This heat really did me in.

15:05.330 --> 15:06.815
Slept like a baby. How about you?

15:10.904 --> 15:13.997
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

15:15.401 --> 15:16.648
I didn't think

15:16.673 --> 15:18.873
that the end would unfold like this.

15:21.803 --> 15:23.907
I turn forty tomorrow, you know.

15:24.473 --> 15:26.014
Every man

15:26.039 --> 15:28.820
in my family dies
before they turn forty.

15:29.621 --> 15:31.436
It's the Conroy curse.

15:31.461 --> 15:33.742
- The what?
- Conroy curse.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.568
Granddaddy Conroy fell down a well.

15:35.593 --> 15:38.759
They said he shouted a bit, but
Granny was pretty deaf by then.

15:38.784 --> 15:40.741
My uncle died at Christmas

15:40.766 --> 15:43.687
when the tree he was chopping
down fell on top of him.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.161
And good ole Dad...

15:46.771 --> 15:48.264
he was electrocuted to death

15:48.289 --> 15:51.030
while he was fixing his television set.

15:52.569 --> 15:54.303
Yeah.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.559
It was a tow truck company
out in Scarborough.

15:56.584 --> 15:59.166
And Shade didn't mention if he
was going anywhere else after?

15:59.191 --> 16:01.138
You mean with Ace Ventura?

16:01.447 --> 16:03.006
'Cause of the Hawaiian shirt

16:03.031 --> 16:05.577
and the weird... No, he didn't mention

16:05.602 --> 16:08.514
- where he was going after that.
- I need you to make a phone call.

16:08.539 --> 16:10.673
I need the police report
for Estelle Dorset.

16:10.698 --> 16:13.325
Are you thinking there's actually
something to this murder idea?

16:13.350 --> 16:15.390
I haven't talked to Shade
since yesterday afternoon.

16:15.414 --> 16:18.061
I know it sounds crazy, but
Conroy might be onto something.

16:18.086 --> 16:20.590
- Willowton, right?
- Yeah.

16:20.856 --> 16:24.238
Thank you. Just call me
when you get the report.

16:32.557 --> 16:36.440
Awkward, when you say bye and
then walk in the same direction.

16:36.465 --> 16:38.370
Well, I can't let you go
to a tow truck company

16:38.395 --> 16:39.952
in the middle of nowhere by yourself.

16:39.977 --> 16:42.202
- I'm gonna go with you.
- You don't need to do that.

16:42.227 --> 16:44.459
Well, I actually sent Shade
and the other cop out there,

16:44.484 --> 16:47.727
so if anything has happened,
I do need to know about it.

16:48.297 --> 16:51.067
- Cool.
- Cool.

16:51.827 --> 16:53.571
Sushi.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.889
Flying in an airplane.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.542
Never learning the difference
between effect with an 'e'

16:58.567 --> 17:00.229
and affect with an 'a'...

17:00.489 --> 17:03.473
I don't know, there's so much stuff.
What about you?

17:03.498 --> 17:05.998
I don't even know
what game we're playing.

17:06.022 --> 17:08.723
Do you have any regrets? We're
playing regrets right now.

17:08.757 --> 17:10.455
No, I don't believe in them.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.607
They're only opportunities
for learning.

17:12.884 --> 17:14.359
Really?

17:14.385 --> 17:17.892
- What about, like, Angie?
- What about Angie?

17:17.916 --> 17:20.123
OK, come on. You're gonna
sit there and tell me

17:20.147 --> 17:22.944
that you never, ever, ever...

17:23.117 --> 17:27.071
thought about being with Angie?!

17:27.097 --> 17:30.479
Right there! See? Right there.

17:32.003 --> 17:33.683
Could we just focus on
getting out of here?

17:33.707 --> 17:35.924
I get it, I get it. Love is tough.
It's very tough.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.667
In my graduating class in high
school there was one girl,

17:38.692 --> 17:40.596
and she was my twin sister Edie.

17:40.621 --> 17:41.636
Wow...

17:41.661 --> 17:44.656
I mean, yes, at the Police
Academy, there was a woman.

17:44.681 --> 17:46.753
I never had the courage to ask her out.

17:47.011 --> 17:49.661
Ever. Darla.

17:50.249 --> 17:52.550
And every month there's
this singles mixer

17:52.575 --> 17:54.193
in the curling club down the road

17:54.218 --> 17:55.612
and they say that she goes,

17:55.637 --> 17:57.955
and every month I say
that I'm gonna go,

17:58.292 --> 18:00.731
but every month, I just chicken out.

18:00.756 --> 18:04.510
And now it just seems so... stupid.

18:04.933 --> 18:07.887
Hey. Hey. Magnum?

18:07.912 --> 18:09.573
Listen to me.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.636
We're getting out of here.
And when we get out of here,

18:12.660 --> 18:14.589
you're going to go to
that singles mixer.

18:14.614 --> 18:15.854
You know how I know that?

18:15.879 --> 18:18.254
- How?
- 'Cause I'm gonna take ya.

18:18.890 --> 18:22.436
I'm a good wingman.

18:22.461 --> 18:24.597
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

18:24.801 --> 18:26.685
He's coming back.

18:27.179 --> 18:31.118
Alright. When he comes
through that door,

18:31.143 --> 18:33.649
I'm gonna take him on, and
you hit him with this.

18:33.674 --> 18:35.689
- What?
- Yeah.

18:35.847 --> 18:37.472
- God...
- You ready?

18:37.497 --> 18:38.839
No.

18:38.864 --> 18:40.313
OK...

18:45.459 --> 18:48.673
You guys still in there?

18:48.706 --> 18:50.497
No. I mean...

18:50.522 --> 18:54.289
I'm not dead. The other guy...

18:54.314 --> 18:57.104
very much dead. He's super dead.

18:57.129 --> 19:00.270
I personally do not... do
not feel very good at all.

19:00.330 --> 19:02.705
Hey, listen, you let us go
now and it'll all be OK.

19:02.730 --> 19:04.433
You don't have to kill anyone.

19:04.458 --> 19:07.278
And we will not call the cops.

19:10.881 --> 19:13.920
- What's going on out there?
- What is going on out there?

19:13.945 --> 19:16.434
Let's just say you should buckle up.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.401
So what's with the go bag?

19:36.619 --> 19:38.862
I've been prepped
to investigate a murder

19:38.887 --> 19:40.713
since I was in high school.

19:41.017 --> 19:43.770
You always wanted to be a cop?

19:43.916 --> 19:46.909
It was either that or go
into the family business.

19:46.934 --> 19:49.798
- Which was?
- Carpet cleaning.

19:51.597 --> 19:54.236
After I graduated, my
dad offered me a job

19:54.261 --> 19:57.393
answering phones and said
if I worked hard enough,

19:57.418 --> 20:00.203
in a few years he would
promote me to sales.

20:00.776 --> 20:04.417
So I enrolled in the Police
Academy the next afternoon.

20:27.344 --> 20:29.176
Hello?

20:34.885 --> 20:36.423
They're not here.

20:36.448 --> 20:38.854
There's no sign of them. They
must have come and gone.

20:38.879 --> 20:41.127
Police report from Willowton.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.860
There's an accompanying
autopsy report for a suicide?

20:43.885 --> 20:46.178
Yeah, that would have been
ordered by our good friend.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.349
Deputy Conroy behind
his Sergeant's back.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.054
Well, apparently it was good reason.
She had a clean bill of health,

20:52.078 --> 20:54.217
but according to the
autopsy, she had a high dose

20:54.242 --> 20:56.020
of benzodiazepine in her system.

20:56.045 --> 20:58.880
A sedative? She was found in her car.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.466
Both benzo and carbon monoxide
will put you to sleep.

21:01.491 --> 21:03.379
You wouldn't need to use both.

21:03.957 --> 21:06.837
I think we need to take a visit to
Willowton to see the medical examiner.

21:06.861 --> 21:08.870
Exactly what I was thinking.

21:56.377 --> 21:58.202
Hey there.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.162
The receptionist is on her lunch break.
Who're you?

22:01.187 --> 22:03.921
We're looking for
Sergeant Lydia Sullivan?

22:03.946 --> 22:06.869
You can't pee here. There's a gas
station five minutes up the road.

22:06.894 --> 22:08.305
I'm Detec...

22:08.330 --> 22:12.501
Trainee Detective Danica
Powers from Metro PD.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.007
You're a long way from the city.

22:16.258 --> 22:18.536
I'm actually friends with Eddie Conroy.

22:18.561 --> 22:20.595
He came to us about Estelle's death.

22:20.620 --> 22:23.628
Suicide, you mean? Poor
kid won't let it go.

22:23.653 --> 22:26.093
We caught him breaking into her
house in search of 'evidence',

22:26.117 --> 22:29.454
and then he had the audacity to
order an autopsy behind my back.

22:29.479 --> 22:32.817
About that autopsy. Have you
had a chance to review it yet?

22:32.842 --> 22:35.076
Does it look like I have
all the time in the world?

22:36.186 --> 22:38.679
Um, could we talk to
the Medical Examiner?

22:38.704 --> 22:40.871
- Conroy?
- No. The Medical Examiner.

22:40.896 --> 22:44.880
- Yeah. Conroy!
- Yeah, be right there.

22:46.122 --> 22:49.131
Thought I heard Toronto folk.
What can I do for you?

22:49.422 --> 22:50.969
You're Eddie's...?

22:50.994 --> 22:54.691
Sister. Twin, actually.
Older by two minutes.

22:54.716 --> 22:57.448
Took his sweet time coming
out the ol' birth canal.

22:57.473 --> 22:59.530
That explains a lot.

22:59.555 --> 23:02.647
And you're the Medical Examiner?

23:02.672 --> 23:05.136
Town vet, too. And doctor.

23:05.161 --> 23:07.985
- Incredible.
- The autopsy you prepared...

23:08.010 --> 23:09.570
What can you tell us
about the sedatives

23:09.595 --> 23:10.862
you found in Estelle's system?

23:10.887 --> 23:13.164
Did she have a prescription
for Benzodiazepine?

23:13.195 --> 23:14.477
I never wrote her one.

23:14.502 --> 23:16.142
Doesn't mean she couldn't
have gotten some

23:16.166 --> 23:18.195
from the local drug
dealer, though?

23:18.220 --> 23:20.665
I don't push pills,
that's Old Man Pitfield.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.836
Listen, if you want to go about your
own investigation, be my guest.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.944
I'll give you the keys
to Estelle's place.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.392
Telling you, though,
won't find anything...

23:28.417 --> 23:31.114
Lonely conspiracy nut
who offed herself.

23:32.359 --> 23:34.376
Sad but true.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.580
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

23:45.508 --> 23:49.512
Help!

24:10.963 --> 24:14.032
You have mosquito repellent
in your detective kit?

24:14.057 --> 24:16.057
You know what the most
deadly creature on earth is?

24:16.081 --> 24:18.473
Next to humans, of course... mosquitos.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.839
You're welcome.

24:20.864 --> 24:24.066
Terrible service out here.

24:26.751 --> 24:29.090
OK...

24:29.418 --> 24:33.680
- Parrilla de flujo de aire?
- Air... something.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.167
Yeah, I got that much.

24:35.192 --> 24:37.510
Grandpa, I don't know. I
went to Italy, not Spain.

24:40.420 --> 24:42.215
Yeah.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.345
Hey, Don, just checking in. Any news?

24:44.370 --> 24:45.862
No, nothing yet.

24:45.887 --> 24:47.995
Did you hear from Jules?

24:48.020 --> 24:50.571
- Who's on the phone? Is it Dad?
- It's Angie.

24:50.770 --> 24:52.565
Angie, hello?

24:53.205 --> 24:54.339
Hello?

24:54.364 --> 24:56.258
Hello?

24:56.283 --> 24:58.190
Call dropped.

24:58.275 --> 25:02.095
It's gonna be OK, kid.
It's gonna be OK.

25:03.134 --> 25:06.768
- Anything?
- No, I lost the call.

25:06.793 --> 25:08.268
What did you lose back there?

25:08.293 --> 25:10.571
Just the engagement ring
I bought for my girlfriend.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.666
- What? Did you find it?
- No. It's fine, though.

25:13.691 --> 25:16.721
It's a 10-dollar ring from Kensington
Market. I'll buy her a new one.

25:17.033 --> 25:18.510
She's really against diamonds

25:18.535 --> 25:20.463
and she's not really a jewelry person.

25:20.488 --> 25:23.358
I didn't know you were getting married.
Congratulations.

25:23.383 --> 25:25.367
I don't know if I am yet.

25:25.523 --> 25:28.129
I've had the ring in my
bag for two months now.

25:31.199 --> 25:34.107
You take the bathroom,
I'll take the bedroom.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.236
No Benzo yet!

25:47.261 --> 25:49.920
Same. And they didn't find
any in the car with her,

25:49.945 --> 25:51.808
so where the hell is it?

25:51.833 --> 25:54.294
This definitely seems
like a murder case to me.

25:54.319 --> 25:57.120
And not just because I've
been hoping for one.

25:58.881 --> 26:02.036
- So your girlfriend...
- Kate.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.789
Does she know you're going to propose?

26:03.814 --> 26:05.554
She has no idea.

26:05.579 --> 26:08.319
It's silly, really. It's
probably just an overreaction.

26:08.344 --> 26:10.714
- To what?
- Her leaving.

26:10.739 --> 26:12.672
She's a war correspondent.

26:12.697 --> 26:16.409
She's heading to Damascus next
week, and every time she goes,

26:16.434 --> 26:18.393
I get this horrible
feeling in my stomach

26:18.418 --> 26:20.771
like I'm never gonna see her again.

26:26.971 --> 26:29.174
I'm so sorry. I didn't think.

26:29.199 --> 26:31.575
No, no, no, it's OK.

26:32.831 --> 26:35.802
When did you know that
Kate was "the one"?

26:38.671 --> 26:42.533
Well, I'd just been turned down
for my fifth straight patrol job.

26:42.558 --> 26:44.691
That night, she took me out for dinner

26:44.854 --> 26:48.292
and she told me that, no matter what,
she would always believe in me.

26:48.317 --> 26:49.989
And that was it.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.209
Hey, look at that grate.

26:54.518 --> 26:56.772
Looks like it's been moved.

27:00.251 --> 27:05.104
- Estelle, you sneaky little bugger.
- This is really old.

27:11.174 --> 27:13.288
Mineral Ore Deposit.

27:13.313 --> 27:14.825
Property Ventures?

27:14.850 --> 27:17.523
Estelle went to lot of trouble
to hide these things.

27:21.301 --> 27:25.271
- Hey!
- Gosh! Hello!

27:27.724 --> 27:29.806
Somebody!!

27:42.805 --> 27:46.579
Hey! What are you doing?

27:46.604 --> 27:48.793
Making some air holes for ya.

27:56.068 --> 27:59.466
Hey, I gotta admit, I went
through your wallet, Matt Shade.

27:59.491 --> 28:01.835
Matt Shade... you're the hockey player!

28:01.860 --> 28:03.889
Yeah, that's right. I am.

28:03.914 --> 28:06.545
Aw, man, I still remember
that playoff game

28:06.570 --> 28:09.170
where you scored the winning goal.
Knocked it right out of midair.

28:09.194 --> 28:10.583
- That was incredible.
- What?

28:10.608 --> 28:13.334
- Thanks?
- It's too bad I gotta kill you.

28:13.390 --> 28:15.120
Come on, man.

28:15.145 --> 28:16.881
You don't have to do that. Look,

28:16.906 --> 28:18.563
I know you're just a hired gun.

28:18.588 --> 28:19.717
You let us out of here and

28:19.742 --> 28:21.805
we'll help you take down
your boss together.

28:21.830 --> 28:24.713
No can do, man. She'd kill me, too.

28:26.364 --> 28:28.460
- She?
- What?

28:32.255 --> 28:33.895
OK, thanks.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.978
So it looks like it's a real
estate holdings company

28:38.003 --> 28:40.412
that pays out dividends
to its investors.

28:40.437 --> 28:43.099
Did you figure out how many people
are invested in the company?

28:43.124 --> 28:45.029
That's the weird part.
There's only four:

28:45.054 --> 28:47.737
Estelle Dorset, Betty
Love, Rosemary Dupond,

28:47.762 --> 28:50.656
and Alice Van Horn. Do you know them?

28:50.681 --> 28:53.303
Yeah. I already talked to Betty

28:53.328 --> 28:56.616
and she mentioned her friend
Rosemary, who died 6 weeks ago.

28:56.773 --> 28:58.115
Of what?

28:58.190 --> 29:00.092
Betty mentioned the flu.

29:00.117 --> 29:02.469
No autopsy was done.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.793
And the monthly dividend payments

29:05.818 --> 29:07.692
went up right after Rosemary's death.

29:07.717 --> 29:09.347
But why?

29:09.401 --> 29:11.572
Maybe they had life insurance
policies on each other?

29:11.597 --> 29:13.943
That's not how life insurance works.

29:13.968 --> 29:15.548
We need to talk to the fourth woman.

29:15.573 --> 29:17.583
Alice Van Horn.

29:19.648 --> 29:22.450
A 6-letter word for "tap."

29:22.475 --> 29:24.910
Has an "F" and a "C" in there.

29:25.716 --> 29:27.985
It's "faucet", Mom.

29:28.010 --> 29:31.708
Hello. You must be the
investigators that called.

29:31.733 --> 29:34.161
Yes. I'm Angie.

29:34.186 --> 29:35.890
This is Officer Powers.

29:35.915 --> 29:38.883
Trainee Detective Powers. Hello!

29:39.222 --> 29:41.055
Is she...?

29:41.080 --> 29:44.735
Not much of a conversationalist,
but I can try and help you.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.893
Yeah, sure. Um...

29:46.918 --> 29:48.599
We're looking into a
financial investment

29:48.624 --> 29:50.086
your mother was involved in

29:50.111 --> 29:52.005
that's been linked to
a possible murder.

29:52.030 --> 29:53.870
Do you know anything about
Mineral Ore Deposit.

29:53.894 --> 29:56.588
Property Ventures?

29:58.997 --> 30:01.731
Mineral Ore Deposit is "Maude".

30:01.756 --> 30:04.978
That's the name that Conroy
heard Estelle talking about.

30:05.003 --> 30:07.286
Betty did us good.

30:07.311 --> 30:10.545
She was such a schemer, that one.

30:12.748 --> 30:15.029
Rosemary?

30:15.749 --> 30:17.904
- Rosemary?
- No, Ma.

30:17.929 --> 30:20.416
- This isn't Rosemary.
- Rosemary...

30:20.441 --> 30:23.626
She's been struggling with
Alzheimer's for a long time now.

30:23.650 --> 30:26.977
She doesn't know much of what's
she's saying these days.

30:27.284 --> 30:30.228
I'm sorry, did you say murder?

30:30.509 --> 30:32.905
Should I be worried about
my mother's safety?

30:32.930 --> 30:34.896
We're gonna talk to the
staff in the building

30:34.921 --> 30:37.281
and see if there's any additional
precautions they can take.

30:37.305 --> 30:38.746
Thank you.

30:38.771 --> 30:41.939
I have to get her to her
physiotherapy appointment.

30:41.964 --> 30:43.938
Excuse me.

30:44.347 --> 30:46.464
This is my card.

30:46.739 --> 30:50.221
If she says anything about
MOD, please call me.

30:55.722 --> 30:58.941
When I talked to Betty, she said
she'd never heard of 'MOD'.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.490
All I can see is gravel and water.

31:11.106 --> 31:14.436
Whoa... OK, what is happening?

31:14.688 --> 31:17.302
I don't know, but that can't be good.

31:22.238 --> 31:26.118
- No. No, no, no, no, no...
- What is it?

31:34.974 --> 31:36.878
I'm starting to think

31:36.903 --> 31:39.572
that these aren't air holes.

31:44.388 --> 31:46.880
We know about your MOD investment.

31:47.170 --> 31:48.591
Well.

31:49.681 --> 31:51.771
Is there something we
can help you find?

31:51.796 --> 31:55.226
It's my pills. They're
in here somewhere.

31:55.251 --> 31:58.872
I have to take one every couple
of hours. Here they are.

32:03.907 --> 32:06.995
Why didn't you tell me about
this when we met yesterday?

32:07.020 --> 32:09.020
Because it's none of your business.

32:09.073 --> 32:11.592
Did you murder Estelle and Rosemary?

32:11.617 --> 32:15.607
I most certainly did not!

32:16.031 --> 32:18.243
And you watch your tone, young miss.

32:18.644 --> 32:20.656
We were best friends.

32:20.681 --> 32:23.270
I mean, sure, over the past
couple of decades we grew apart,

32:23.295 --> 32:26.056
but from the early 70s

32:26.081 --> 32:28.014
through the millennium,

32:28.039 --> 32:29.917
those women were my family.

32:29.942 --> 32:32.008
We took care of each other.

32:32.272 --> 32:34.579
And then MOD took care of us.

32:34.738 --> 32:38.404
So you admit to the investment scheme.
Listen,

32:38.429 --> 32:39.869
you just need to come clean with us.

32:39.893 --> 32:41.678
Somebody's trying to kill its members.

32:41.703 --> 32:43.095
So you think.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.620
Estelle's death was actually a murder?

32:45.645 --> 32:47.604
We strongly believe so, yes.

32:48.548 --> 32:50.612
Then I guess I'd better tell you...

32:51.032 --> 32:53.107
Betty? Betty?

32:53.132 --> 32:55.886
- My heart...
- Betty, what's going on?

32:55.911 --> 32:57.992
I'm calling an ambulance.

33:06.576 --> 33:09.475
OK, you might have been right.
I don't think this is working.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.962
I just think it's soaking through.

33:21.311 --> 33:23.098
Come on!

33:33.427 --> 33:35.850
Betty's stable now,
and in the hospital.

33:35.875 --> 33:37.858
Forensics checked her pills.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.912
- And?
- Arsenic poisoning.

33:39.937 --> 33:41.407
Somebody sprayed them.

33:41.432 --> 33:43.713
Shade and Conroy have been
missing for more than 24 hours.

33:43.737 --> 33:44.420
After 24 hours...

33:44.445 --> 33:47.115
- We'll find them.
- Hey, look at this.

33:47.140 --> 33:50.088
Upon death, all shares
revert back to the company.

33:50.113 --> 33:51.642
OK, well, that explains

33:51.667 --> 33:53.589
why the dividends went up for Estelle.

33:53.614 --> 33:55.841
The money was redistributed
to other members,

33:55.866 --> 33:57.489
so the more members that die...

33:57.514 --> 33:59.562
The more the others' shares go up...

34:00.291 --> 34:03.794
- My God. It's a tontine.
- A French tart?

34:04.021 --> 34:06.481
No. But close.

34:06.506 --> 34:08.076
Think pie.

34:08.225 --> 34:10.732
My dad and I dealt with some
fraudsters who had a tontine

34:10.757 --> 34:12.219
a couple of years ago.

34:12.244 --> 34:13.888
It starts out like a
regular investment,

34:13.913 --> 34:15.282
with people pooling their money

34:15.306 --> 34:19.072
to buy something big. In their
case, four pieces to the pie.

34:19.242 --> 34:22.038
Now, the investment pays
out a dividend each month,

34:22.063 --> 34:24.114
but when someone dies, with
one less person to pay,

34:24.139 --> 34:26.036
everyone else gets a bigger dividend.

34:26.062 --> 34:28.629
So instead of passing the shares
onto their descendants...

34:28.654 --> 34:30.755
Their shares stay with the investment.

34:30.780 --> 34:33.606
When Rosemary died, Estelle's and
the other women's share increased,

34:33.630 --> 34:36.713
- but now that Estelle's dead...
- Alice and Betty's payout

34:36.737 --> 34:40.650
will increase. OK, so what happens
when you're just left with one?

34:41.797 --> 34:43.702
The last person standing
gets everything

34:43.726 --> 34:45.418
and they get to pass
it onto their heirs.

34:45.443 --> 34:47.444
Who else knows about this investment?

34:47.469 --> 34:49.389
Maybe someone's putting
their thumb on the scale.

34:49.413 --> 34:51.965
No one, as far as we can tell.

34:53.809 --> 34:57.244
Unless... Alice's daughter, Janet.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.773
She was pretty quick to leave
once we mentioned MOD.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.624
And didn't even question why
anyone would be after her mother.

35:02.649 --> 35:04.609
Plus, I'll bet she's got
power of attorney because

35:04.633 --> 35:05.932
of her mother's Alzheimer's.

35:05.957 --> 35:07.624
Wait a second.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.506
That truck they were after...

35:09.531 --> 35:11.442
Who is it registered to?

35:13.975 --> 35:15.648
Jackson Van Horn.

35:15.673 --> 35:19.397
Van Horn... Alice Van Horn.
Could that be her son?

35:19.422 --> 35:21.604
And Janet's brother.

35:22.108 --> 35:24.009
This is the Conroy curse.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.263
I'm so sorry for bringing
you down with me.

35:26.288 --> 35:28.812
Stop talking like that.
Nobody's dying in here.

35:28.837 --> 35:31.681
I don't know how, but we're
getting out of here.

35:34.023 --> 35:36.289
What was that?

35:39.460 --> 35:43.862
- Man, we're going down.
- What? God!

35:58.046 --> 36:01.848
- I can't swim! I can't swim!
- Grab onto the roof.

36:01.873 --> 36:04.217
There you go.

36:04.242 --> 36:07.153
I haven't been in water
since cousin Tony drowned

36:07.178 --> 36:09.883
in a charity dunk tank
on his 39th birthday...

36:11.160 --> 36:13.283
You just hold on tight.
I'll be right back.

36:13.308 --> 36:15.608
What? Where are you going?!

36:15.633 --> 36:19.604
- Down.
- What? No, don't go down!

36:23.204 --> 36:25.878
God... he went.

36:39.684 --> 36:42.031
I said don't go down.

36:42.616 --> 36:44.470
What happened?

36:44.590 --> 36:47.658
OK, good news. The door is open.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.257
The impact broke the lock.

36:49.282 --> 36:50.951
All we gotta do is swim down and out.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.528
- What? I can't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

36:53.553 --> 36:54.873
I can't do that. I won't make it.

36:54.897 --> 36:56.565
You can. I'll guide you through it.

36:56.590 --> 36:58.257
I can't do it. I can't do it.

36:58.282 --> 37:00.409
Conroy, hey, look at me!

37:00.434 --> 37:02.548
Conroy... Sushi.

37:02.573 --> 37:05.473
The singles mixer. I'm gonna
teach you the difference

37:05.498 --> 37:08.655
between effect and affect,
but we gotta go right now.

37:09.250 --> 37:11.262
Will you tell Angie
how you really feel?

37:11.287 --> 37:13.186
- What?
- Promise me

37:13.211 --> 37:15.952
that you will tell Angie
how you really feel!

37:15.977 --> 37:18.668
Yeah, sure, fine, whatever.
We gotta go. You ready?

37:18.693 --> 37:21.101
- God.
- One, two,

37:21.126 --> 37:22.976
three!

37:46.374 --> 37:48.448
Hey!

37:57.827 --> 37:59.649
Hello?

38:00.641 --> 38:02.457
You there?

38:02.544 --> 38:04.347
I did it.

38:04.484 --> 38:06.194
Yeah, they're at the
bottom of the lake.

38:06.219 --> 38:07.703
Hey!

38:12.384 --> 38:15.699
Yeah! OK!

38:15.724 --> 38:18.399
- Get his arm.
- I'm gonna get his arm.

38:24.316 --> 38:28.015
- Get something to tie him up.
- Get something to tie him up?

38:31.787 --> 38:34.577
Gimme a signal. Signal.

38:37.197 --> 38:41.406
Unknown number. Shade?

38:41.431 --> 38:44.416
Hey. I'm at... I don't know, a quarry,

38:44.441 --> 38:46.592
maybe it's a gravel pit.

38:46.617 --> 38:49.266
Hang in there, OK? Help's on
the way right now. Are you OK?

38:49.291 --> 38:52.022
Is Conroy OK?

38:52.143 --> 38:53.707
Drop the phone!

38:58.597 --> 39:01.293
Shade? Shade!

39:01.318 --> 39:03.803
How did you manage to screw this up

39:03.828 --> 39:06.272
in the three minutes since
we've hung up the phone?

39:06.297 --> 39:08.467
You know what? You can stay like that.

39:08.492 --> 39:10.390
I don't have the energy for you.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.194
Come on, move it.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.113
Back to the water.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.548
- The Conroy curse.
- Pick it up, boys.

39:37.352 --> 39:40.122
Drop your weapon! Now!

39:40.147 --> 39:42.455
Get your hands where we can see 'em!

39:45.306 --> 39:47.665
OK, I'm unarmed, I'm unarmed!

39:56.830 --> 39:59.063
What took you so long?

40:07.848 --> 40:10.857
- We made a good team today.
- We did.

40:11.447 --> 40:14.292
You know, I think I'm gonna go
back tomorrow and buy that ring.

40:14.317 --> 40:17.609
It's time. Can't wait forever,
you know what I mean?

40:17.634 --> 40:19.561
That's a great idea.

40:19.968 --> 40:22.577
- Sergeant Sullivan?
- Deputy.

40:22.602 --> 40:24.876
Deputy, I think I owe you an apology.

40:24.901 --> 40:27.058
You were right, and I
should have listened.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.868
That's Jules.

40:29.893 --> 40:32.103
I've been keeping her
and your dad updated.

40:32.128 --> 40:34.621
She's going to yell at me,
and then she's going to cry.

40:34.646 --> 40:36.538
So this means my suspension's lifted?

40:36.563 --> 40:37.658
Yeah. See you Monday.

40:37.683 --> 40:40.017
OK, and maybe a promotion?

40:40.042 --> 40:43.184
I'm pretty sure she'll hug
you when you get home.

40:43.686 --> 40:45.919
Hey, Jules.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.393
Hi, honey. No, I'm fine.

40:48.718 --> 40:50.707
Honey, I'm fine.

40:50.732 --> 40:54.234
Yeah, honey, I couldn't call you.
They took my phone.

40:54.259 --> 40:56.443
Honey, calm down.

40:56.468 --> 41:00.512
Honey, honey, it's OK.
Listen, I'm fine, OK?

41:00.537 --> 41:03.826
They didn't do anything to me.
I'm fine, OK?

41:05.334 --> 41:07.805
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the tontine earlier.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.061
It's just... it's not especially legal.

41:10.086 --> 41:11.671
I can sorta see why.

41:11.696 --> 41:13.598
How'd you set it up in the first place?

41:13.623 --> 41:15.502
The four of us were admin assistants

41:15.527 --> 41:17.527
for a group of geologists.

41:17.552 --> 41:20.453
None of us were married, and we were
determined to secure our future

41:20.478 --> 41:21.858
on our own terms.

41:21.883 --> 41:24.092
We withdrew our pensions
and pooled our money.

41:24.117 --> 41:25.092
Did you know

41:25.117 --> 41:26.678
there was a mineral
deposit on the land?

41:26.703 --> 41:27.801
No.

41:27.826 --> 41:30.173
It was Alice who noticed the signs.

41:30.198 --> 41:32.842
So we rented out the land to
a mineral extraction company

41:32.867 --> 41:35.576
and that kept us safe
for over 40 years.

41:35.601 --> 41:38.893
How about now? Alice's
two kids are in jail...

41:38.918 --> 41:42.251
Well, I have a guest room
that barely gets used.

41:42.615 --> 41:45.359
Nobody should be without
friends or family.

41:45.584 --> 41:47.380
Daisies!

41:47.998 --> 41:50.042
That's right, Alice.

41:51.457 --> 41:53.717
They're your favourite, aren't they?

41:54.222 --> 41:56.640
We'll pick some up on our way home.

41:56.803 --> 41:58.756
Thank you, Betty.

42:00.330 --> 42:03.056
You ladies are lucky to
have found one another.

42:05.713 --> 42:08.013
- So nice!
- It's working again!

42:08.161 --> 42:11.814
- Thank God!
- Conroy? What are you doing here?

42:11.839 --> 42:13.365
He fixed the air conditioning.

42:13.390 --> 42:15.042
Well, you know, couldn't have done it

42:15.067 --> 42:17.401
without my two trusted assistants here.

42:18.473 --> 42:22.456
- He speaks Spanish. Self-taught.
- Con la ayuda de Rosetta Stone.

42:22.481 --> 42:25.316
- Thanks, Conroy.
- Don't mention it.

42:25.341 --> 42:28.642
Our reservation's in 15 minutes.
We should get going.

42:28.667 --> 42:31.542
OK. Well, hey, thank you again.

42:31.876 --> 42:33.690
You guys go have some fun out there.

42:33.715 --> 42:35.331
No, Conroy, you're coming with us.

42:35.356 --> 42:37.558
It's your 40th birthday, man.
You broke the curse!

42:37.714 --> 42:40.009
God, you're right!

42:40.034 --> 42:42.451
Wow, OK! Alright, where are we going?

42:42.476 --> 42:45.543
Sushi! When I make a
promise, I don't forget it.

42:45.568 --> 42:46.907
Aw, how cute,

42:46.932 --> 42:50.176
you two making plans and promises
while stuck in that death trap.

42:50.201 --> 42:53.636
Actually, you, you made
another promise out there.

42:53.661 --> 42:56.470
That's right. I promised

42:56.495 --> 42:59.373
that I would be your wingman at
that singles mixer up north!

42:59.398 --> 43:02.808
My gosh! I almost forgot about that!

43:02.833 --> 43:04.597
That's a good save, buddy.

43:04.622 --> 43:06.452
You know what would make this birthday

43:06.477 --> 43:08.777
- even better than it already is?
- What's that?

43:08.802 --> 43:10.922
Maybe just let me drive the
Porsche to the restaurant.

43:10.946 --> 43:12.985
What? Come on, I almost drowned!

43:13.010 --> 43:15.206
- Yes, you did.
- And while that was happening,

43:15.231 --> 43:17.417
I remember that you made a promise...

43:17.442 --> 43:19.792
- Can you drive a stick?
- I mean, I could learn.

43:19.817 --> 43:20.566
What?

43:20.591 --> 43:22.471
- Don't even bother.
- I think we're outta here.
