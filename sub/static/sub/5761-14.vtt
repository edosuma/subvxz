00:07.900 --> 00:10.200
My name is Melinda Gordon.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.500
I'm married...

00:11.600 --> 00:13.800
I live in a small town...

00:13.900 --> 00:15.700
and I own an antique shop.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.800
I might be just like you...

00:17.900 --> 00:19.600
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:19.700 --> 00:21.900
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.400
It's all right, honey.

00:23.508 --> 00:26.600
"Earth-bound spirits,"
my grandmother called them.

00:26.703 --> 00:29.208
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:29.306 --> 00:33.001
and they come to me for help.

00:34.504 --> 00:39.909
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:46.509 --> 00:49.101
Well, it was definitely
worth the trip.

00:49.207 --> 00:51.803
I mean, they want to do
the estate sale so fast,

00:51.907 --> 00:53.500
there was very minimal haggle.

00:53.607 --> 00:56.102
The haggle factor's very important.

00:56.207 --> 01:01.200
Yeah, I'm going to have to hire a truck
to go up there next week.

01:01.307 --> 01:04.200
Damn. This road is really dark.

01:04.307 --> 01:06.100
Hey, be careful.
How far out are you?

01:06.206 --> 01:08.201
I have no idea.

01:08.305 --> 01:09.903
You've got to get a gps.

01:10.006 --> 01:13.903
Hey! Grandview 19 miles. Whoo-hoo.

01:14.006 --> 01:16.702
Hmm. Oh, and other
signs of civilization.

01:16.807 --> 01:19.001
Hey, an old fruit stand.

01:19.106 --> 01:20.001
You know what?

01:20.105 --> 01:24.203
I think we stopped by there
and got apples once. Yeah.

01:24.307 --> 01:25.700
And, um...

01:25.806 --> 01:29.102
well, a car, sort of.

01:31.307 --> 01:34.402
Well, that's weird.

01:34.607 --> 01:36.301
Mel?

01:36.406 --> 01:38.500
I think I just went in a circle.

01:38.608 --> 01:39.701
Mel?

01:39.806 --> 01:41.102
Jim?

01:41.207 --> 01:42.703
Mel.

01:42.805 --> 01:45.302
Jim! Oh!

01:46.008 --> 01:49.402
Redial, redial, redial.

01:53.907 --> 01:56.301
Great.

02:15.307 --> 02:17.500
Ok.

02:48.807 --> 02:55.403
I'm talking to the police right now,
and they're going to be here any minute.

02:55.507 --> 02:58.700
Are you ok in there?

03:02.605 --> 03:04.403
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ok.

03:04.507 --> 03:07.300
Sorry if I scared you.
You stuck?

03:07.407 --> 03:11.300
- Yeah, it died.
- Pop the hood.

03:22.507 --> 03:23.902
Are you looking for it?

03:24.008 --> 03:28.703
- Looking for what?
- Someone's going to die.

03:29.807 --> 03:32.502
Try it now.

03:35.305 --> 03:37.503
You're a miracle worker.
How did you do that?

03:37.608 --> 03:41.802
- You need anything else?
- How do I make it back to route 47?

03:41.908 --> 03:43.103
You're all turned around.

03:43.207 --> 03:45.900
Just hang a u-ie,
look for signs for 86 south,

03:46.008 --> 03:48.003
and then 47 should be
about a mile after that.

03:48.105 --> 03:49.601
Ok, thank you.

03:49.708 --> 03:52.502
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:32.406 --> 04:36.003
EPISODE 2x14
"Speed Demon"

04:37.408 --> 04:40.200
I just don't remember you ever being
haunted by an actual skeleton before.

04:40.305 --> 04:42.800
Oh, it was a ghost, believe me.

04:42.907 --> 04:46.600
Don't they usually look the way
they did when they died the first time
they come to you?

04:46.708 --> 04:49.303
Yeah, so let's not even think about
what happened to this guy.

04:49.407 --> 04:53.902
How about let's stay off that road
so we don't ever run into
halloween man again, huh?

04:54.008 --> 04:56.902
I love the Jim Clancy simple approach.

04:57.008 --> 04:59.202
Avoidance--it's worked
for guys for centuries.

04:59.308 --> 05:03.400
He said that someone was going to die.
That doesn't exactly lend itself
to avoidance.

05:03.506 --> 05:04.903
All right.
What does it mean?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.103
I don't know.
I'll try and figure it out.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.900
- How?
- Don't know.

05:09.006 --> 05:12.101
See you for lunch.

05:12.808 --> 05:16.701
- Same time? Same bench?
- Yeah.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.603
Wow. What a haul!

05:44.308 --> 05:46.303
Straight sale, no consignment.

05:46.407 --> 05:50.201
Yeah, well, the problem is
I want to buy most of it for myself.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.502
And  you are my best customer.

05:51.606 --> 05:54.202
Yeah, I need to find a way out
of that cycle.

05:54.308 --> 05:55.100
What are you doing?

05:55.205 --> 05:58.302
Oh, just trying to avoid
the physical labor I know must come.

05:58.405 --> 05:59.702
Hey, is Ned coming by?

05:59.808 --> 06:02.700
No, he is doing a study group
with 3 kids from school.

06:02.806 --> 06:04.501
They take turns at each other's houses.

06:04.608 --> 06:06.300
Oh, that sounds like
a good way to make friends.

06:06.405 --> 06:09.403
Well, I keep volunteering my house
for all his sessions,

06:09.506 --> 06:11.902
so I can basically sit in the middle
of the floor and stare at them.

06:12.006 --> 06:14.303
- Just as a precaution.
- Yeah. Is that too much to ask?

06:14.408 --> 06:17.402
- But, you know, of course they
didn't bite. - Mmm, I sense an issue.

06:17.508 --> 06:20.503
It's all starting to be about his
friends. That's what he calls them.

06:20.605 --> 06:23.901
"They're my friends, mom."
No names.

06:24.008 --> 06:26.702
Sounds like he's turning out
to be a very normal kid.

06:26.806 --> 06:28.101
I guess so.

06:28.206 --> 06:33.601
Hey. You know, you never told me
what happened on your date with Tim.

06:33.708 --> 06:38.403
Well, there would have actually had to
have been a date in order for me
to tell you about it.

06:38.505 --> 06:41.502
- What happened?
- He didn't show.

06:41.608 --> 06:45.201
- What?
- It's no big deal.

06:51.907 --> 06:54.400
Melinda--

06:55.006 --> 06:57.502
Melinda?

07:02.205 --> 07:04.000
Sorry.

07:04.108 --> 07:07.101
I'd really appreciate it
if you wouldn't tell Jim.

07:07.208 --> 07:09.300
Right.

07:09.408 --> 07:11.502
Are you ok?

07:11.608 --> 07:17.302
I'm fine. You're the one who looks
like she just saw a ghost.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.500
Why is it harder when
you're trying to get lost?

07:23.605 --> 07:26.603
You're doing great.
I have no idea where we are.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.302
Didn't we used to have a map in here?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.702
Hey, thanks for doing this.

07:31.807 --> 07:34.602
Do you think I'd let you come back out
on this road again by yourself?

07:34.707 --> 07:37.100
Aha! Map.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.801
Hey, do these mean anything to you?
19026?

07:40.908 --> 07:42.600
- What's left on our mortgage?
- No.

07:42.705 --> 07:45.103
- Last plumber's bill?
- No again.

07:45.208 --> 07:48.103
I have no idea.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.903
What was...

07:59.705 --> 08:03.600
- Gas?
- No, I have half a tank.

08:08.508 --> 08:11.500
Do you see that?

08:13.307 --> 08:15.103
What does that mean?

08:15.207 --> 08:21.202
I was hoping you'd tell me.
It was in--I wasn't here the last time.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.600
- Uh, got the brake.
- It won't move!

08:28.707 --> 08:31.300
- Your feet off the gas?
- Both feet are on the brakes!

08:31.407 --> 08:35.803
Oh, damn it!
It's going to be all right.

08:37.005 --> 08:40.500
I'll pop it into neutral.

08:40.806 --> 08:42.802
Keep your feet down.

08:42.907 --> 08:46.903
- I'm trying!
- Turn it, turn it.

09:01.706 --> 09:04.301
All right.

09:07.207 --> 09:09.503
What?

09:10.408 --> 09:12.603
- Looking for the midnight circle?
- What?

09:12.707 --> 09:16.103
Someone's going to die.

09:21.105 --> 09:23.000
See, now I know
we're going the wrong way.

09:23.107 --> 09:25.003
We're all the way
on the other side of town.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.503
Well, if I can just get the adrenaline
that's still coursing through my veins

09:27.605 --> 09:30.003
- to slow down, I might figure it out.
- Sorry.

09:30.106 --> 09:33.703
Why can't we just go home at night 
and watch dvds like normal couples?

09:33.805 --> 09:36.303
Hey, look, we can stop
and ask for directions.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.101
I don't need directions.
I got it figured out.

09:38.206 --> 09:42.101
- I just need to find this one road.
- Wait a minute.

09:42.208 --> 09:47.403
That's the girl who helped me
on the road last night.

09:53.308 --> 09:56.500
Engine seems fine.
Just running a little hot, I think.

09:56.607 --> 09:59.202
Anyway, if you want to leave it here,
I can run some diagnostics.

09:59.306 --> 10:01.803
Oh, no. I don't think there's
anything wrong with the car.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.003
Wow. That's cool.

10:04.106 --> 10:05.100
Do you mind?

10:05.206 --> 10:08.202
It's  got the roll bar and the magnesium
wheels, 4-inch exhaust, right?

10:08.307 --> 10:09.801
Your  husband knows cars. Cool.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.802
While he's distracted, will you please
tell me how to get back to route 47?

10:12.907 --> 10:16.093
- Oh, yeah, let me write it down here.
- Thank you.

10:16.207 --> 10:19.702
- So, how long have you worked here?
- I own it.

10:19.808 --> 10:21.100
Seriously?

10:21.203 --> 10:23.608
- I mean, not that that's...
- No, it's ok.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.101
My father, he loved cars and he didn't
have a son fast forward, here I am,

10:27.204 --> 10:30.709
- or something like that.
- Wow. I'm in awe.

10:30.809 --> 10:32.500
I don't know the first thing
about cars.

10:32.608 --> 10:34.903
Well, we don't deal too much
with everyday car staff.

10:35.005 --> 10:39.500
Most of our clients are serious racers,
real car people.

10:39.605 --> 10:42.700
The road that you found me on last night...

10:42.805 --> 10:45.002
Do you know if there have been
any accidents there?

10:45.105 --> 10:47.502
You know, like serious
people dying accidents?

10:47.608 --> 10:50.503
- Not that I know of.
- Any other weird things?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.901
Weird like how?

10:52.005 --> 10:54.800
I don't know, weird like
cars going haywire,

10:54.908 --> 10:57.900
seeing strange things on the road.

10:58.008 --> 11:01.303
Sorry. Other than the odd roadkill,
not much goes on out there.

11:01.408 --> 11:03.303
Anyway, here's the directions,
and my number's on there

11:03.408 --> 11:06.402
- if you have any more car trouble.
- Thank you so much.

11:06.508 --> 11:10.501
- Have you ever heard of the
midnight circle? - What's that?

11:10.606 --> 11:14.202
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.401
Ok, Joe. It's ready.

11:17.506 --> 11:20.601
Time to unpeel your husband
away from my cars.

11:20.708 --> 11:25.700
Honey, honey. Can we just move in here
for, like, a week? What do you think?

11:25.808 --> 11:28.201
Oh. Business, huh?

11:28.306 --> 11:30.402
Directions.

11:30.508 --> 11:33.203
- The midnight what?
- The midnight circle.

11:33.306 --> 11:36.902
- Is that a name, a place, a thing?
- None of the above. All of the above.

11:37.005 --> 11:39.702
- Well, did you check the phone book?
- Yeah, there was no listing.

11:39.806 --> 11:44.103
Huh. Thank you.
I'll see you next time.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.600
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, hey! How was school?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.803
- I need $10.
- Oh. For school?

11:51.906 --> 11:53.303
No.

11:53.405 --> 11:55.501
- Well, then, for what?
- I don't know. With my friends.

11:55.605 --> 11:57.202
In case we stop for pizza or something.

11:57.306 --> 11:59.702
Are there children at this
midnight circle, because if not,

11:59.808 --> 12:03.402
please, take me there now.

12:04.806 --> 12:08.701
Hey, do you know what it is, Ned?
The midnight circle?

12:08.806 --> 12:10.901
Um, no.

12:11.005 --> 12:14.101
Never heard of it.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.802
So, Jim is working tonight,

12:24.906 --> 12:28.102
and I am starving. You want to go
to Lento's and grab a bite?

12:28.205 --> 12:31.302
Oh, I would love to, but I really
have to make sure that Ned's

12:31.405 --> 12:33.102
doing his homework.
Can I get a raincheck?

12:33.208 --> 12:38.102
- Yeah, no problem. Good night.
- Ok. Good night.

13:20.008 --> 13:23.000
You don't belong.

13:30.907 --> 13:32.502
They were just giving me a ride home.

13:32.607 --> 13:34.402
I don't want you in a car
with people I don't know.

13:34.506 --> 13:38.103
- Those kids are too old for you, Ned.
- They like me. They're my friends.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.803
- Wait. That's your study group?
- What's the big deal?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.403
The big deal is I'm your mother.

13:42.506 --> 13:44.601
I want to know who you're with
and where you are.

13:44.705 --> 13:48.700
- You want to control everything I do.
- Most of it, yes. That's my job.

13:48.808 --> 13:53.600
You are not an adult yet, Ned,
as much as you think you are.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.601
And don't blame Melinda. She told me
because she cares about you,

13:56.708 --> 13:59.500
not because she wanted to
get you in trouble.

13:59.606 --> 14:03.100
I could tell things, too.

14:08.305 --> 14:13.103
- Hey, where are you going?
- Home, to prison.

14:13.908 --> 14:15.602
Ned!

14:15.706 --> 14:17.101
I keep your secrets.

14:17.205 --> 14:19.702
Hey, that's not what this is about.

14:19.805 --> 14:21.101
Who were those guys?

14:21.207 --> 14:23.401
They go to my school.
They help me study.

14:23.507 --> 14:25.602
Now I look totally lame.

14:25.707 --> 14:29.001
Look, there was a bumper sticker with
numbers on it. What does it mean?

14:29.105 --> 14:31.101
Hey.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.103
I know when I talked about
the midnight circle yesterday

14:33.207 --> 14:34.803
- that you knew what it was.
- I don't.

14:34.905 --> 14:37.100
I'm not playing around, Ned.

14:37.207 --> 14:38.901
There is a ghost attached
to your friends,

14:39.006 --> 14:41.502
or the midnight circle,
whatever it is.

14:41.606 --> 14:44.202
A dangerous ghost.
You have to tell me.

14:44.307 --> 14:47.600
I don't know anything.

15:01.106 --> 15:03.603
- Hi. I'm...
- Melinda Gordon. Yes.

15:03.708 --> 15:05.601
I know all about you.

15:05.708 --> 15:08.202
I'm Kate Payne.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.902
I'm so glad to meet you finally.

15:11.006 --> 15:12.800
Are you?

15:12.905 --> 15:15.501
Well, yes.

15:15.907 --> 15:20.000
Get on there. Get on there.
I'm telling you to get on there.

15:20.105 --> 15:22.102
Maybe I chose a bad time.

15:22.207 --> 15:27.803
No. He's in a bit of a bad mood,
but don't let it bother you.

15:27.906 --> 15:30.100
It was lovely to meet you.

15:30.205 --> 15:31.001
Get on there.

15:31.105 --> 15:33.903
Just do me the favor
and just get on there.

15:34.005 --> 15:34.700
Get on there.

15:34.807 --> 15:39.600
You do realize that that's an inanimate
object that can't understand you?

15:39.707 --> 15:43.101
Oh, it understands me. They all do.
They understand every word I'm saying.

15:43.206 --> 15:43.400
Who?

15:43.505 --> 15:47.002
Who? The nail, the picture frame,
the hammer. The hammer understands me.

15:47.105 --> 15:49.003
The bastards have the whole
thing planned out.

15:49.105 --> 15:51.301
- I was warned you were in a bad mood.
- Yeah, I'm in a bad mood

15:51.407 --> 15:54.402
because some people really know
how to get under my skin, ok?

15:54.507 --> 15:56.403
Now, where's my hammer?
I don't even have my hammer now.

15:56.505 --> 15:59.402
I had my hammer right here.
I'm losing my mind.

15:59.508 --> 16:01.303
Looking for this?

16:01.408 --> 16:04.000
Yes, I am. And you know what?
I've had just about as much aggravation

16:04.106 --> 16:05.703
as I can stand for one day, thank you.

16:05.808 --> 16:07.901
Ok, sorry. Bad timing.

16:08.005 --> 16:10.600
And I don't want to talk about it, ok?
So, please don't try to drag it out of me?

16:10.705 --> 16:14.500
- Ok, no problem. I'll see ya.
- It's about my wife, if you must know.

16:14.608 --> 16:18.103
Well, I don't must know,
so if you'd rather not talk about it...

16:18.205 --> 16:19.502
Thank you. I feel so much better.

16:19.607 --> 16:23.603
Now, what can I do for you,
Melinda Gordon?

16:23.705 --> 16:27.701
Do you have any idea
what these numbers mean?

16:27.805 --> 16:31.900
- 1 9 0 2 0 6. Map coordinates?
- Checked it already. Doesn't add up.

16:32.008 --> 16:35.503
Well, it adds up in numerology to... 9.

16:35.607 --> 16:37.102
- Meaning?
- Meaning 9.

16:37.206 --> 16:40.400
9 is the divine number, the number
of completion, the eternal number.

16:40.505 --> 16:42.603
The chinese considered it
the celestial number.

16:42.708 --> 16:46.902
And  there's the famous 9 course meal
at my favorite vietnamese restaurant,
beef or fish.

16:47.008 --> 16:49.400
- Is any of this helping you? 
- Not really.

16:49.506 --> 16:52.002
Of course not. Because none of this
has anything to do with numerology.

16:52.108 --> 16:53.702
- It doesn't?
- No, it doesn't.

16:53.808 --> 17:00.802
But that doesn't stop me from going on
and on with all the minutiae I know,
does it?

17:03.608 --> 17:05.301
- It's a date!
- It's a date.

17:05.406 --> 17:07.599
Challenge me next time
you come in here, won't you?

17:07.705 --> 17:11.599
19th of february, 2006.
That's a year ago next monday.

17:11.705 --> 17:16.101
It's a significant date. February 19,
1945 was the battle of Iwo Jima.

17:16.205 --> 17:18.701
The phonograph was invented in 1878.

17:18.807 --> 17:23.400
Paul  Simon writes "Sounds of Silence"
1964, february 19.

17:23.505 --> 17:26.803
Big makeout song for me.

17:26.907 --> 17:27.800
How do you know all that?

17:27.906 --> 17:29.503
Well, while the other kids
were out playing baseball...

17:29.708 --> 17:31.801
- You were studying.
- No. I was chasing girls.

17:31.905 --> 17:35.801
I never had to study.
Studying I never did because
knowledge came so easy to me.

17:35.906 --> 17:37.102
Girls, not so much.

17:37.207 --> 17:39.600
Ok. Have you ever heard
of the midnight circle?

17:39.705 --> 17:42.703
- Knitting club for insomniacs?
- You're hilarious. Yes or no?

17:42.808 --> 17:45.003
No.

17:45.207 --> 17:47.201
No? That's it?

17:47.308 --> 17:50.201
Wait, there's no medieval
significance or minutiae?

17:50.308 --> 17:53.501
Uh, oh! No.
I don't know anything about it.

17:53.607 --> 17:55.401
- Ok, then.
- I have a picture to hang.

17:55.506 --> 17:57.901
Great.

18:02.905 --> 18:06.802
You know, if you do ever want to talk,

18:06.907 --> 18:10.502
I'm a really good listener.

18:11.006 --> 18:14.400
I don't know if I have
any training for that.

18:14.507 --> 18:17.002
Yeah, I didn't think so.

18:17.107 --> 18:20.101
Keep it in mind.

22:40.008 --> 22:41.802
I can't believe you lied to me.

22:41.906 --> 22:44.303
It was a secret.
I had to promise I wouldn't tell.

22:44.407 --> 22:46.003
And that was the midnight circle?
There's nothing else?

22:46.105 --> 22:48.201
'Cause no more games, Ned.

22:48.308 --> 22:51.102
It's a race, a couple of times a month.

22:51.208 --> 22:54.600
They race for money, pink slips,
stuff like that.

22:54.706 --> 22:59.600
- And there aren't any rules.
- Where does your mom think you are?

22:59.706 --> 23:01.103
In bed.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.700
I climbed out the window.

23:03.808 --> 23:07.900
You have no idea
how much trouble you're in.

23:08.006 --> 23:10.500
Delia was furious.
I mean, she was so embarrassed.

23:10.608 --> 23:13.500
Here she is thinking that her
son is asleep in his bedroom.

23:13.607 --> 23:16.603
I thought you said you weren't going to
go out on that road again without me.

23:16.707 --> 23:19.600
I had to go when I had the chance.

23:19.706 --> 23:23.802
- Is that where you saw the ghost?
- Yeah. He was in the car that crashed.

23:23.906 --> 23:26.503
- You think he caused it?
- I don't know what to think.

23:26.605 --> 23:30.900
I mean, I know that the ghost
is attached to this world,
but it's all so secret.

23:31.008 --> 23:34.201
You should have seen the way they all
scattered when they heard the sirens.

23:34.308 --> 23:35.801
You think he's trying
to hurt the racers?

23:35.907 --> 23:40.700
Yeah. And I'm really worried
about Cindy, because he said
that somebody's going to die.

23:40.805 --> 23:43.102
Maybe that's the way
he died--in a crash.

23:43.206 --> 23:45.801
I keep checking online,
but I don't have a lot to go on.

23:45.907 --> 23:47.702
I don't know his name.
I don't know what he looked like.

23:47.807 --> 23:49.901
I don't know when he died.

23:50.005 --> 23:53.503
I'll check the records at work,
ask around.

23:53.606 --> 23:56.302
Look, no offense.
It's just not something we talk about.

23:56.405 --> 23:58.502
Yeah, I understand,
but people may get hurt.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.202
That's half the thrill
of the whole thing.

24:00.307 --> 24:03.300
- For some people.
- Ok, you almost got killed last night.

24:03.408 --> 24:06.700
Last night? I don't think so.
I was at home in bed last night.

24:06.807 --> 24:10.801
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sorry. Um, Melissa, is it?

24:10.907 --> 24:12.601
Melinda.

24:12.706 --> 24:15.502
Yeah, well, I got to run.
There's coffee and pastry in the breakroom.

24:15.605 --> 24:19.801
Help yourself.
Thanks for coming by.

24:43.507 --> 24:46.603
He died in an illegal street race
19th of february last year

24:46.705 --> 24:49.101
in the same spot where
my car first broke down.

24:49.205 --> 24:53.201
It says he owned Pike custom owners.
He was racing a guy named Ray Peters.

24:53.307 --> 24:55.203
There were no charges filed.
There's nothing else.

24:55.305 --> 24:56.701
Look at the bottom.

24:56.806 --> 25:01.000
Survived by his fiancee Cindy Brown.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.703
- Cindy Cindy.
- Exactly.

25:02.808 --> 25:05.201
Now I know who the ghost is
and who he's attached to.

25:05.306 --> 25:07.801
- What's he trying to do?
- Protect her? I don't know.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.501
Maybe he's going to wipe out
all the people who race against her?

25:10.605 --> 25:13.103
Sounds like a true romantic.

25:13.208 --> 25:17.000
- All right, what are you going to do?
- I've got to find this ghost tonight.

25:17.108 --> 25:19.502
You doing anything?

25:19.607 --> 25:21.902
Cool.

25:27.306 --> 25:30.402
Just, uh, stay in the beam
of the headlight.

25:30.507 --> 25:34.303
Yeah. I'll wave if I need you.

25:44.205 --> 25:46.801
I know your name.

25:46.907 --> 25:49.602
Gordon Pike.

25:49.708 --> 25:52.901
I know that you died in a car race.

25:53.005 --> 25:55.701
I can help.

25:56.206 --> 26:00.103
I think I know what's going on.

26:00.907 --> 26:05.203
This has to do with Cindy, doesn't it?

26:11.408 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, it's about Cindy.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.301
Well, I can help you
talk to her if you want,

26:16.408 --> 26:19.502
if it'll help you cross over,
but you can't stay here.

26:19.606 --> 26:23.301
- You just can't.
- I trained her, taught her to race.

26:23.405 --> 26:26.203
Everything she knows is because of me. 

26:26.308 --> 26:28.503
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you can protect her forever.

26:28.605 --> 26:30.902
I don't want to protect her.

26:31.007 --> 26:34.301
I'm going to kill her.

26:34.906 --> 26:38.700
She thought she was as good as me.
She wanted to prove she was better.

26:38.806 --> 26:42.103
I don't understand. I thought you two
were a couple. Weren't you engaged?

26:42.206 --> 26:45.803
I was her first love.
She thought I was a rock star.

26:45.907 --> 26:48.701
Most people were afraid of me
because I wanted to race.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.201
Not  her.

26:50.308 --> 26:52.702
I've never had anybody
look at me that way before.

26:52.808 --> 26:56.202
Ok, so what went wrong?

26:56.508 --> 26:58.702
I let her drive my car.

26:58.806 --> 27:00.500
What?

27:00.706 --> 27:03.801
I taught her to race.
I showed her everything I know.

27:03.906 --> 27:06.603
She was good, too.
A natural.

27:06.705 --> 27:08.902
Then she didn't need me anymore.

27:09.007 --> 27:12.600
She wanted to prove
she was faster and smarter.

27:12.706 --> 27:16.302
- Was she?
- Smarter, maybe.

27:16.405 --> 27:19.503
She really knew how to mess
with my head before a race.

27:19.608 --> 27:23.002
It started with just kid stuff.
She's got to competitive with me.

27:23.107 --> 27:25.702
Then she had to keep pushing it.

27:25.807 --> 27:29.000
- Like, sometimes she'd mess
with my nitrous. - Nitrous?

27:29.105 --> 27:32.800
You inject it into the manifold
when you need a last-second boost.

27:32.905 --> 27:35.400
Or she'd mess with my fuel mixture.
Little things.

27:35.508 --> 27:39.700
But then I started losing,
and it wasn't funny anymore.

27:39.808 --> 27:44.902
The night I died was a big race between
me and Ray Peters, a 15k payday.

27:45.006 --> 27:48.002
And she warned me she wasn't going
to let me get paid that night.

27:48.108 --> 27:49.601
So, what happened?

27:49.705 --> 27:53.301
I came out of the turn, hit the nitrous button.

27:53.408 --> 27:57.003
Next thing I know... boom!

28:00.607 --> 28:05.203
I'm floating above my car watching it burn.

28:05.608 --> 28:08.801
And I see my body just laying there,

28:08.907 --> 28:12.302
all the skin burned off.

28:13.405 --> 28:16.301
Do you really think that Cindy
could do something like that?

28:16.406 --> 28:19.003
Maybe, maybe not.
Same result.

28:19.107 --> 28:21.401
She took things too far.

28:21.505 --> 28:24.703
Did you cause the crash the other night?

28:24.805 --> 28:30.803
I was just having some fun,
making Jimmy bash her around a little.

28:32.207 --> 28:35.101
I'm saving the real thing for monday.

28:35.207 --> 28:37.400
The 19th of february.

28:37.508 --> 28:41.200
The day you died, a year ago.

28:43.006 --> 28:45.200
Well, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to make fun.

28:45.306 --> 28:48.300
No, it's ok. I'm used to people
being in tears right about now.

28:48.407 --> 28:52.100
I can just picture Gordon running around
like a ghost, still trying to win races.

28:52.206 --> 28:54.401
What a funny idea.

28:54.506 --> 28:55.503
You know I'm not kidding.

28:55.605 --> 28:58.702
Oh, no. You seem like you really believe it.

28:58.806 --> 29:02.503
He told me that he made Jimmy
run into your car.

29:02.607 --> 29:03.803
What do you want?

29:03.905 --> 29:05.500
I think Gordon's trying to hurt you.

29:05.606 --> 29:09.003
Well, he couldn't do that anymore
than he already has.

29:09.106 --> 29:11.501
He told me that he taught you
everything about racing.

29:11.607 --> 29:13.502
He did. But once I got the hang of it,

29:13.605 --> 29:15.901
I could make a car do
any damn thing I wanted.

29:16.008 --> 29:17.801
My very first race I won.

29:17.908 --> 29:21.201
Then I won the next one and
the one after that. It was crazy.

29:21.308 --> 29:25.901
Right away, people started
to know my name.

29:31.008 --> 29:32.603
Gordon got so jealous.

29:32.706 --> 29:35.900
He still thought he was better than me,
and he never let me forget it.

29:36.007 --> 29:38.501
He even got a car straight from
Japan with right-hand drive--

29:38.605 --> 29:40.802
anything to get attention.

29:40.905 --> 29:44.503
So, naturally,
I'd challenge him,

29:44.605 --> 29:46.001
and I'd beat him.

29:46.105 --> 29:48.200
Over and over again.

29:48.305 --> 29:51.100
I wasn't just Gordon Pike's
girlfriend anymore.

29:51.208 --> 29:54.303
He was Cindy Brown's boyfriend.

29:54.407 --> 29:57.203
- He said he was your first love.
- Oh, he was.

29:57.307 --> 29:59.701
He was everything I thought
a man was supposed to be.

29:59.807 --> 30:02.302
And then he showed me what I could do.
He showed me what was possible.

30:02.405 --> 30:06.603
I mean, I never thought I had any kind
of talent, let alone this kind.

30:06.708 --> 30:09.000
- Just one problem.
- What?

30:09.106 --> 30:13.003
Once he saw how good I was, he wanted
to put the genie back in the bottle.

30:13.106 --> 30:14.400
Like how?

30:14.506 --> 30:17.202
He'd do anything to keep
guys from racing me.

30:17.307 --> 30:19.701
What happened the night he died?

30:19.806 --> 30:22.900
Gordon was pissed. Ray Peters
had never been beaten before.

30:23.008 --> 30:27.103
He had to wait in line to race him.

30:27.307 --> 30:29.002
Me and you, finally.

30:29.107 --> 30:33.002
- Man, I'm shaking.
- Yeah, you will be.

30:33.108 --> 30:35.900
You're the one I should be racing,
not your old man.

30:36.007 --> 30:38.803
You're the one to beat,
from what I hear.

30:38.905 --> 30:42.100
Yeah, well, you have to
get past him first.

30:42.207 --> 30:44.801
Done deal.

30:48.408 --> 30:52.102
He was out of control after that,
and I guess I wasn't much comfort.

30:52.207 --> 30:53.503
What do you mean?

30:53.607 --> 30:55.000
I liked it.

30:55.108 --> 30:56.402
I liked that Ray said what he said.

30:56.505 --> 31:00.903
Hell, it was more of a compliment
than I ever got from Gordon.

31:01.005 --> 31:05.502
He thinks that you did something to
his car to cause the crash that night.

31:05.607 --> 31:07.600
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Gordon.

31:07.707 --> 31:09.603
Ray Peters ran him off the track.
Everyone knows that.

31:09.705 --> 31:12.700
- So, Ray Peters caused the accident?
- The king of dirty tricks?

31:12.805 --> 31:15.100
He probably did it just coming out
of the turn where no one could see.

31:15.208 --> 31:19.700
- Yeah, but Gordon's car blew up.
- Look!

31:19.908 --> 31:25.001
I did love Gordon, even when
I hated him. You understand?

31:25.107 --> 31:26.601
Not really, no.

31:26.706 --> 31:30.603
I would never have done anything
to hurt Gordon. Not like that.

31:30.706 --> 31:36.100
And if he is really here
like you say he is, he knows it.

31:39.807 --> 31:41.502
I feel like I've gone from
"West Side Story" to

31:41.605 --> 31:43.901
- "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."
- It's just so weird.

31:44.008 --> 31:46.703
Two people who start out loving
each other end up hating each other.

31:46.805 --> 31:47.500
How does that happen?

31:47.608 --> 31:50.001
The question you gotta ask is
why do they keep making it happen.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.102
What do you mean?

31:51.208 --> 31:53.400
Well, I mean, everybody's
got a storeroom, right?

31:53.505 --> 31:55.800
Resentment, grudges, anger?

31:55.907 --> 31:58.601
Most people, they open up that storeroom
and they let a few of them out.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.803
You know, they deal with them.
They get rid of them.

32:00.906 --> 32:04.701
Something tells me that your storeroom
would be standing room only.

32:04.807 --> 32:07.100
Yeah, sometimes i gotta knock down
the wall into the next storeroom,

32:07.205 --> 32:11.103
but the point is, you know, a couple,
two people, they start using those bad

32:11.208 --> 32:14.203
things from that storeroom
against each other, why stay?

32:14.307 --> 32:15.101
Why not move on?

32:15.207 --> 32:16.900
Maybe they're getting
something out of it.

32:17.007 --> 32:19.000
Yeah. They need to be miserable.

32:19.106 --> 32:21.603
For some people, that's as strong
as the need to breath.

32:21.706 --> 32:23.501
It's like they're feeding off
each other, like they're trying

32:23.605 --> 32:28.502
to convince each other that
they don't deserve to be happy.

32:28.606 --> 32:31.703
Makes me glad I'm basically a simpleton.

32:31.808 --> 32:33.703
Far from it.

32:33.806 --> 32:36.900
You gotta keep these two people
away from each other for good.

32:37.006 --> 32:38.801
How are you going to do that?

32:38.906 --> 32:41.700
I'm going to talk to a guy
named Ray Peters.

32:41.807 --> 32:43.503
Now you want me
to hang out with racers?

32:43.605 --> 32:46.801
What I want is for you to introduce me
to Ray Peters. It's important.

32:46.905 --> 32:49.600
- Ghost related?
- Yeah, if you must know.

32:49.707 --> 32:52.701
- I like to be kept a little more
in the loop. - You're unbelievable.

32:52.807 --> 32:54.302
You could just think of me
as a sounding board.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.801
Look, are you going to introduce me
to Ray Peters or not?

32:56.908 --> 32:59.401
Are you going to save me from
my mother hanging me by my ankles?

32:59.507 --> 33:01.401
You're lucky to have a mother
who cares so much about you,

33:01.507 --> 33:04.301
and we are not going
anywhere near cars.

33:04.408 --> 33:08.502
Do you know where Ray Peters works?

33:19.106 --> 33:23.001
So, the much feared Ray Peters
delivers pizza?

33:23.107 --> 33:24.003
Yeah.

33:24.105 --> 33:26.202
Very, very fast.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.701
Ok.

33:27.806 --> 33:30.101
Why is she asking me
so many questions, Ned?

33:30.205 --> 33:31.902
Look, she's cool.
She's with me.

33:32.005 --> 33:33.701
Ok, I got it, Ned.
Thanks.

33:33.808 --> 33:36.401
I want to talk about that night.
Do you remember anything?

33:36.505 --> 33:37.801
Like I could forget it.

33:37.905 --> 33:40.300
Am I happy Gordon kissed
the blue wave? No.

33:40.408 --> 33:42.103
Am I happy it wasn't me? Yes.

33:42.206 --> 33:44.903
What about the accident? People say
that you ran Gordon off the track.

33:45.008 --> 33:46.502
People can say whatever
they want to say.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.102
Ok, but did you,
'cause Cindy thinks you did.

33:49.206 --> 33:51.002
- What if I did?
- I want to know.

33:51.107 --> 33:54.400
Not because I want to cause you any
trouble, but because it's important.

33:54.505 --> 33:58.103
Whatever happened that night is between
me and Gordon, and Gordon's dead.

33:58.207 --> 34:02.503
So, I guess you will
really never know.

34:06.705 --> 34:09.302
Will I see you tonight?

34:09.406 --> 34:11.101
You're racing tonight?

34:11.205 --> 34:12.601
You bet your ass.

34:12.706 --> 34:16.601
I'm racing Cindy Brown, finally.

34:17.607 --> 34:20.800
In memory of Gordon.

34:26.804 --> 34:29.100
Now you know why I like
to hang out with these guys.

34:29.206 --> 34:32.902
You, in the store, right now.

34:33.206 --> 34:35.402
If it was Ray Peters,
how come I don't remember?

34:35.505 --> 34:37.803
You said yourself you didn't
remember exactly what happened.

34:37.908 --> 34:40.101
Cindy was always messing with my car.
That's the only thing that could've

34:40.205 --> 34:42.800
made my car blow up, not Ray
forcing me off the track.

34:42.907 --> 34:45.303
I don't think she'd do
anything on purpose.

34:45.407 --> 34:47.703
I think she still has
feelings for you.

34:47.804 --> 34:50.003
- You think?
- Yeah, I do.

34:50.107 --> 34:53.501
I don't think she would ever
try to kill you.

34:53.608 --> 34:56.101
Look, make your peace, Gordon.

34:56.208 --> 34:59.802
Cross over.
Be done with it.

34:59.906 --> 35:02.601
There's only one thing
I need to cross over.

35:02.708 --> 35:04.003
What?

35:04.106 --> 35:06.002
And that's for her
to cross over with me.

35:06.107 --> 35:08.203
And I'm going to make sure
that that happens.

35:08.306 --> 35:11.302
Come with me to the garage
and let me help you talk to her.

35:11.406 --> 35:15.202
You go.
Tell her I said hello.

35:21.506 --> 35:23.202
If you do this, then you can
forget about turning pro.

35:23.306 --> 35:25.502
This is more important
than turning pro.

35:25.606 --> 35:28.201
- What, revenge?
- How about justice?

35:28.306 --> 35:31.002
Nobody ever did anything about how
Gordon died. They all just let it go.

35:31.106 --> 35:33.601
And they think I don't care,
now they're gonna learn different.

35:33.707 --> 35:37.102
I want you to do this. I want justice.
That's what Gordon would have liked.

35:37.208 --> 35:39.201
- People are going to see you do it.
- I've just got to force him up into

35:39.306 --> 35:44.202
the wall, and there's a good chance
he'll roll and he'll get exactly
what he deserves.

35:44.307 --> 35:50.101
Ray Peters killed Gordon.
Tonight I'm going to return the favor.

36:06.905 --> 36:10.100
- Cindy couldn't hurt me if she tried.
- I wouldn't underestimate her.

36:10.206 --> 36:12.402
Why? Because she thinks
I made Gordon crash?

36:12.505 --> 36:17.103
No, because she thinks
you made Gordon die.

36:18.908 --> 36:20.903
She can give me her best shot.

36:21.008 --> 36:23.200
Look, you want to know
who killed Gordon Pike?

36:23.308 --> 36:24.901
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

36:25.005 --> 36:26.900
Gordon Pike killed Gordon Pike.
That's it.

36:27.005 --> 36:28.203
What are you talking about?

36:28.308 --> 36:29.800
He was trying to run me off the track.

36:29.905 --> 36:32.500
But I knew his move,
saw him do it a hundred times.

36:32.605 --> 36:37.200
I braked on him. He shot off my fender
and went into a bad spin, rolled over.

36:37.308 --> 36:39.502
I think he ruptured his fuel tank,
I don't know.

36:39.608 --> 36:41.803
But when he hit the ditch,
his car blew.

36:41.908 --> 36:45.301
He died because he was trying
to screw me and it backfired.

36:45.406 --> 36:47.500
Is he right?

36:47.608 --> 36:49.601
He was ready for me.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.202
He knew what I was going to do.

36:51.308 --> 36:54.401
He used my own momentum
to put me into a spin. - What?

36:54.507 --> 36:57.300
I hit the nitrous to try
to power out of it.

36:57.407 --> 37:00.500
Everything went white.

37:00.607 --> 37:06.103
- Who the hell are you talking to?
- Come on. Let's do it.

37:08.007 --> 37:09.802
It's Cindy's car.

37:09.906 --> 37:12.502
I loosened the bolt
on her steering column.

37:12.608 --> 37:14.501
What?

37:14.606 --> 37:17.303
You're nuts.

37:41.808 --> 37:45.801
Stop the car!

37:55.405 --> 37:57.703
Stop the car!

37:57.805 --> 38:01.503
Stop the car, Cindy! Please!

38:03.908 --> 38:07.401
Stop the car, baby. Please.
It's all my fault.

38:07.506 --> 38:11.603
I'm so sorry.
I know it wasn't you.

38:28.407 --> 38:29.203
Watch out!

38:29.308 --> 38:31.501
- Give her some room!
- I'm ok! I'm ok.

38:31.608 --> 38:33.301
- What happened?
- I don't know.

38:33.407 --> 38:34.302
The steering went out.

38:34.405 --> 38:37.102
I swear, I checked it, Cindy.
It was tight.

38:37.207 --> 38:41.000
It was him, wasn't it?
Tell me. It was him!

38:41.108 --> 38:43.402
Ok, Cindy, please.

38:43.505 --> 38:45.801
He knows what happened,
how it wasn't you and it wasn't Ray.

38:45.907 --> 38:47.803
- It was his own mistake.
- Well, he just tried to kill me!

38:47.907 --> 38:49.501
No, he saved you.

38:49.605 --> 38:52.701
He knew that something was wrong,
and he saved you.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.200
Tell her I'm sorry.

38:54.308 --> 38:56.603
He's here.

38:56.705 --> 39:01.000
You felt him. You could feel him
in that car with you.

39:01.105 --> 39:02.800
I did.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.401
I did feel him.

39:04.507 --> 39:07.701
Ok. He can hear you.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.900
Gordon?

39:11.006 --> 39:13.903
Do you really hate me enough
to want to kill me?

39:14.006 --> 39:15.500
You want to be better than me.

39:15.605 --> 39:17.303
He knows that you wanted
to be better than him.

39:17.408 --> 39:19.700
So, you turned on me?

39:19.808 --> 39:21.803
You made me feel like I was
doing something wrong,

39:21.907 --> 39:23.303
just because I got so good?

39:23.408 --> 39:26.300
I thought it would take you
away from me. I...

39:26.407 --> 39:30.302
He was afraid that he would lose you.

39:30.407 --> 39:35.801
The more he wanted to stop me,
the more I wanted to hurt him.

39:35.908 --> 39:38.503
I'm sorry.

39:38.605 --> 39:42.501
I'm sorry that you thought
I could do something

39:42.606 --> 39:46.902
that horrible to you that night, but...

39:48.005 --> 39:52.400
I guess I would've
thought the same thing.

39:52.508 --> 39:55.202
What does that say
about us, huh?

39:55.308 --> 39:59.001
Wait. Is this it?
Is that light for me?

39:59.105 --> 40:01.703
It means you're ready to cross over.

40:01.808 --> 40:04.103
What?

40:05.108 --> 40:08.403
Can you tell her that I needed her
more than I ever wanted to.

40:08.506 --> 40:14.500
And that's why I pushed her away
and that's why I held her so close.

40:14.606 --> 40:16.902
And tell her if she's smart,
she's going to forget all about me.

40:17.006 --> 40:18.101
She's never going to forget you.

40:18.208 --> 40:21.701
Gordon!
No, I don't want to forget about you.

40:21.808 --> 40:25.001
You changed my life.

40:25.706 --> 40:28.500
I--you made a difference.

40:28.605 --> 40:30.300
Just couldn't handle it.

40:30.405 --> 40:33.401
I was screwed up.

40:38.408 --> 40:42.002
If I had one more chance...

40:44.606 --> 40:48.601
Tell her to take my chance for me.

41:02.205 --> 41:04.603
What just happened?

41:04.705 --> 41:07.301
He's gone.

41:07.705 --> 41:09.203
Gone for good?

41:09.305 --> 41:11.102
It's up to you.

41:11.208 --> 41:14.602
You can make a place for him
and he will always be there.

41:14.707 --> 41:17.100
Hey...

41:17.405 --> 41:20.403
there are some other things
he wanted me to mention.

41:20.507 --> 41:22.702
Ok.
