00:21.400 --> 00:23.040
I started playing
the game at a young age.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.123
And fell in love
with it and...

00:25.320 --> 00:27.040
You know, Nolan Ryan
was my idol growing up.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.407
So obviously I wanted
to be a power pitcher.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.480
You know, I go to college
and I grow into myself

00:31.520 --> 00:34.091
and I hit a 100 for the
first time my junior year.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.649
You know, I guess that's kinda
when I started thinking,

00:38.840 --> 00:41.286
you know, how would I compare
to these guys back in the day?

00:41.520 --> 00:42.567
They didn't
really have radar guns.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.046
You know,
i remember Bob feller

00:44.240 --> 00:45.400
throwing
against a motorcycle.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.721
Um, you know, you've got
Walter Johnson, Sandy koufax...

00:52.920 --> 00:54.046
You know,
you always just wanna know

00:54.280 --> 00:55.441
how you'd stack up

00:55.640 --> 00:58.007
against the greats
of a different era.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.400
If I can get
in a time machine

00:59.440 --> 01:00.771
and just step
into the past,

01:00.960 --> 01:02.320
you know that would be
the best way

01:02.400 --> 01:03.720
to compare yourself
to those guys.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.486
To stand next to them
and throw with them.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.966
This gentleman in blue

01:08.160 --> 01:10.049
claims that he can clock
anything on wheels.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.481
Well, a baseball doesn't
travel on wheels, officer.

01:12.680 --> 01:16.048
But if you want a race,
it's your motorcycle.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.890
I guess
we're all set.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.606
Here's the test which shows
which is the faster.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.006
The racing motorcycle,

01:22.200 --> 01:23.611
or the pitched ball.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.531
Coming down the highway
at a speed of 86 miles per hour,

01:26.720 --> 01:27.960
the policeman crosses
the pitching line

01:28.160 --> 01:29.207
and there they go...

01:29.440 --> 01:32.125
Bingo, and look,

01:32.360 --> 01:35.887
Bob feller gives him a head start of
10 feet before he throws the ball.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.926
Watch the ball now. Bob's
pitch is gaining all the way.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.481
It breaks the target
right through the bull's-eye

01:42.680 --> 01:45.160
a few feet in front
of the motorcycle.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.840
Well, where are you,
mister policeman?

01:46.880 --> 01:48.723
Oh, there you are.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.611
I don't know what your
speedometer reads now,

01:51.840 --> 01:55.447
but that ball was traveling
better than 100 miles an hour,

01:55.640 --> 01:57.324
and that's plenty fast.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.441
Baseball m the 21st century.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.610
It is a game
of specialists.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.690
A game molded
by technology

02:20.880 --> 02:22.530
driven by data,

02:22.720 --> 02:25.200
and statistics.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.765
It's a game
managers try to win

02:27.000 --> 02:30.846
by predicting
what can only be guessed at,

02:31.080 --> 02:33.890
by controlling
what can only be hoped for.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.969
For every time
the umpire says, "play ball,"

02:40.160 --> 02:44.768
it is still a game
of infinite possibility.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.962
And at its core,

02:47.160 --> 02:49.208
an ancient contest

02:49.400 --> 02:53.564
between two people alone
on a field.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.331
A primal battle

02:56.520 --> 02:59.888
between a man
with a stick...

03:00.080 --> 03:01.764
And a man with a rock.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.681
I don't think there's
more excitement anywhere

03:07.880 --> 03:10.281
than a power pitcher
out on the mound

03:10.480 --> 03:12.323
and then you've got
a power hitter up there.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.000
Something's gonna give.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.884
You're getting it all here.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.048
The kid
against the veteran.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.210
The fastballer
against the fastball hitter.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.400
There they go.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.641
Struck him out!

03:24.840 --> 03:26.251
Ballgame is over!

03:26.440 --> 03:28.807
Who was the hardest throwing
pitcher I ever faced?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.331
The fastest fastball...

03:30.560 --> 03:31.891
The nastiest I ever faced

03:32.080 --> 03:33.525
was the hardest thrower
who ever threw a baseball.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.881
The fastest I ever saw was...

03:35.080 --> 03:36.650
He was the hardest thrower
that I ever saw...

03:36.840 --> 03:38.330
He had one
of those special arms.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.047
He threw it harder than any man
i ever saw in my life.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.851
There is this
powerful desire

03:45.040 --> 03:46.485
for every baseball fan

03:46.680 --> 03:49.923
to know, okay, what...
Who threw the fastest pitch?

03:50.160 --> 03:52.561
It's one of the great
mysteries of baseball.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.250
He struck him out swinging.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.680
You just can't
change the game.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.127
You know, no matter
how much time goes by,

03:58.320 --> 04:01.767
everything in essence
remains the same.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.246
He knows I'm throwing
a fastball.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.249
I know I'm throwing
a fastball.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.966
This is it.
Let's see what happens.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.210
Just don't get scared when you look at the
miles per hour and it says "98" up there.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.607
You'd be like, "oh, man." Some pecple
get scared. They start shaking.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.007
You can tell. They don't
want to hold a bat.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.043
You can see it in some of the
batters' eyes, you can tell.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.481
If you got
anywhere close to plate,

04:21.680 --> 04:23.330
and you threw that hard...

04:23.520 --> 04:24.806
High and tight...

04:25.000 --> 04:27.401
There was a lot
of fear involved.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.043
Oh, you can
definitely hear a fastball.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.049
You can hear it
whizzing by you.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.289
It sounds like trouble,
is what it sounds like.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.007
But if you're facing someone
with some control problems...

04:43.200 --> 04:46.443
It can be a very,
very troubling experience.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.081
Even the best batters,
i kinda feel bad for them.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.567
You know,
they're in a situation

04:51.760 --> 04:53.569
that is really pushing
the limits

04:53.760 --> 04:56.570
of what a brain can do.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.364
People go,
"what, were you scared?"

04:58.560 --> 05:00.085
No, you can't have fear
when you walk to the plate.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.209
Because that...
That defeats you.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.442
As predator-prey.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.166
And that's why I never look
at the pitcher's eyes.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.691
He's the predator,
and you're the prey.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.803
If you look
into his eyes.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.126
They wouldn't look at me.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.084
Most hitters
would not look at me.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.965
And I looked at them

05:17.160 --> 05:20.289
I'd follow them up, you know and I'd
look at them and I'd size them up.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.084
And they just look away.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.601
They... you know, they didn't
want any part of me.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.481
You know, I had a license
to kill out there on the mound.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.051
Oh!

05:30.240 --> 05:31.480
He thought
he was hit.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.609
Holy cow.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.760
People would meet me,
even players, and they said,

05:35.880 --> 05:38.042
"man, you're not at all
like you are on the mound,

05:38.240 --> 05:39.240
are you?"

05:39.320 --> 05:41.243
I said,
"no, I... you know,

05:41.480 --> 05:44.404
I couldn't possibly carry that
persona around with me every...

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
I'd be thrown in jail."

05:51.040 --> 05:52.166
Goose gossage.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.170
I would have to say
he has the nastiest...

05:56.360 --> 05:58.044
He had the nastiest...
All of it.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.163
He had the windup
and everything.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.840
And he was very scary.
He was big.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.121
Threw hard.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.129
Very mean.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.405
I would say he was probably
the nastiest I ever faced.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.371
The arm is everywhere,

06:16.600 --> 06:20.002
head could be violently
shaking as he threw it.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.683
And you just hope he had
home plate zeroed in there.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.360
Threw the fastball
in on the hands and got him...

06:27.560 --> 06:29.688
It was one
of my biggest tools

06:29.880 --> 06:30.880
that I had out there

06:31.000 --> 06:33.241
was the intimidation
factor.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.807
There were times that I would
look at a hitter in the box

06:36.040 --> 06:37.530
and I would just
look at him and go,

06:37.720 --> 06:40.724
"man, I would not want
to be this guy right now."

06:42.760 --> 06:44.683
Roy ls gone.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.365
It's the law of the jungle,
you either eat

06:46.560 --> 06:47.560
or you get eaten.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.366
And I was not
gonna get eaten.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.368
Gossage ls throwing bullets.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.331
He is throwing hard.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.891
Struck him out.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.923
You are either the hero
or the goat,

07:01.120 --> 07:02.690
being a relief pitcher.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.848
Closer is the word
they use today.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.929
"Closer" wasn't
even a coined phrase,

07:07.120 --> 07:09.600
we were "relief pitchers."

07:09.800 --> 07:11.609
Live from Fenway park,

07:11.800 --> 07:15.009
the second playoff game ever
in the American league.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.130
My goodness, if there isn't
something about a moment like this

07:18.320 --> 07:20.402
that arouses the competitive
juices in a man,

07:20.600 --> 07:23.046
you've got no business
being involved in sports.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.050
The 191s playoff game

07:26.240 --> 07:30.370
was the biggest game
that I ever played in.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.928
I remember going to bed
the night before the game

07:34.120 --> 07:37.567
thinking that I'll probably be
facing yaz for the final out.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.889
And you know, you're
gonna get some heat right here.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.606
And Mr. "goose" gossage
coming on.

07:43.800 --> 07:48.203
I have never been so nervous
in a game in my life.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.965
I remember coming
out of the bullpen

07:50.160 --> 07:51.286
and it was hard for me

07:51.480 --> 07:53.164
to put one foot
in front of the other.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.125
I was shaking so hard.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.322
So the big
youngster from Colorado

07:58.520 --> 07:59.760
comes on in relief.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.889
I came into the game
in the seventh inning.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.930
With one out a couple of
runners on, I believe.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.929
And I got out
of that jam

08:07.120 --> 08:08.929
and then
the ninth came around

08:09.120 --> 08:10.929
and who comes
to the plate?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.407
The batter ls Carl yastrzemski.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.444
This ballgame going
right down to the wire.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.082
(Two guys on, twc) Outs
in the ninth, in Fenway.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.850
And yaz is coming up
to the plate.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.850
Well, I had a moment
to think about...

08:25.040 --> 08:27.566
You know, because yaz was
getting a standing ovation.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.810
For about...
Seemed like five minutes.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.366
And I had a conversation
with myself.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.769
I said, "gosh, why
are you so nervous?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.769
What's the worst thing
that can happen?"

08:39.960 --> 08:43.486
I said, "I'll be back in
Colorado tomorrow, elk hunting."

08:43.679 --> 08:45.603
It's just a game.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.211
It felt like the weight
of the world

08:47.400 --> 08:49.243
was lifted
off my shoulders.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.683
It was the first time all day
that I had relaxed.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.241
And I knew because when
yaz stepped in the box,

08:55.440 --> 08:56.480
the first pitch
i threw him

08:56.560 --> 09:01.600
was the hardest pitch
i had thrown all day.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.245
Popped up, that might be it.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.881
Nettles over
at third base.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.731
He'll squeeze it
and it's over.

09:08.920 --> 09:12.049
And look
at those Yankees.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.567
And I remember in all
the chaos in the clubhouse,

09:14.760 --> 09:16.728
I went in the training room
to get away from,

09:16.920 --> 09:17.967
kin da everybody,

09:18.200 --> 09:19.804
and just gather
my thoughts a little bit

09:20.000 --> 09:22.241
and thurman followed me
in the there, munson.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.330
And he goes,
"that had another foot

09:25.520 --> 09:27.807
on anything else
you've thrown all day."

09:28.040 --> 09:29.246
I said,
"i relaxed."

09:29.440 --> 09:31.408
He said, "what the hell
took you so damn long?"

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
Where's he at?

09:32.720 --> 09:33.846
Right down
in the middle.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.408
There he is right there,
rich gossage.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.647
That guy could throw.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.490
- Tony, you faced him.
- Yeah.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.960
If you're
a right-handed hitter,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.206
you had no chance.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.640
Wasn't that
the pine tar deal?

09:44.840 --> 09:46.285
He was the pine tar guy.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.851
All right, here's the challenge,

09:48.040 --> 09:51.647
Brett with the bat,
and gossage with the ball.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.966
You know,
i was generating

09:53.160 --> 09:55.242
some kind of power
with that fastball

09:55.440 --> 09:57.761
and George,
was swinging the bat

09:57.960 --> 09:59.928
as hard
as he could swing it.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.685
And wow.

10:01.880 --> 10:02.961
Uh-oh.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.850
Uh-oh.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.605
That's gone.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.211
And then when
he finally hit 'em,

10:08.400 --> 10:11.244
they threw the bat away
and called you out.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.124
That was
the worst part of all.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.560
Well, what
they're talking about

10:14.640 --> 10:16.768
is that he's got
too much pine tar.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.041
George Brett
looking around,

10:18.240 --> 10:19.844
wanting to know
what's going on.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.201
There's pine
tar all over this bat.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.209
Tim mcclelland,
the home plate umpire

10:23.400 --> 10:25.971
lays it across home plate,
which is 18 inches wide.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.128
They might be
gonna call George Brett out.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.765
Well, the Yankees win.
He is out.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.291
Yes, sir.
Brett is out.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.602
Look at this.
Brett is out.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.290
And he is steaming mad.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.687
That was maddest human being
I've ever seen

10:37.880 --> 10:39.689
anywhere in my life.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.370
We're walking
off the field.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.325
And we're all laughing.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.568
I loved being
a power pitcher.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.969
If I could change
one thing in my career,

10:50.160 --> 10:51.400
iwouldn't change
a single thing.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.800
You know, I said,

10:53.040 --> 10:55.805
even the home runs I gave up
were great.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.808
My name's Clifford blankenship.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.604
I'm a big league catcher
by trade.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.201
For the Washington senators.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.842
I was a backup, batting .219,
until I broke my finger.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.840
Now I'm in weiser, Idaho,
on a wild-goose chase.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.724
Here to look over
some palooka

11:20.920 --> 11:24.811
who was burning up the snake
river valley semi-pro league.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.287
Someone sent the senators
a telegram,

11:27.480 --> 11:29.403
said there was a kid,
Johnson,

11:29.600 --> 11:31.523
threw so fast
you couldn't see 'em.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.563
And that he knew
where he was throwing it too,

11:33.760 --> 11:35.728
'cause if he didn't,

11:35.960 --> 11:39.931
there'd be dead bodies buried
at home plates all over Idaho.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.043
I get to the field
just in time

11:42.240 --> 11:44.368
to see him
shamble out to the mound.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.244
All arms and legs.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.091
Eyes down like he don't
even wanna be there.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.886
Then... holy smoke.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.970
19 years old and no one
in big league ball

11:55.160 --> 11:57.811
ever had a fast one
like this.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.971
So I offer the kid $500
to join the senators.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.168
You know what
that hayseed says?

12:04.360 --> 12:06.044
If I promise him
train fare home

12:06.280 --> 12:07.645
in case
he don't make it,

12:07.840 --> 12:09.046
he'll come.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.651
I say, "kid...

12:10.840 --> 12:13.605
A one way ticket's
all you're gonna need."

12:21.640 --> 12:23.847
When the greatest
hitter of the time, Ty Cobb,

12:24.040 --> 12:26.122
first faced
Walter Johnson,

12:26.320 --> 12:28.926
he said that the ball
traveled so fast

12:29.120 --> 12:32.408
that it hissed like a train
as it went by.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.961
The legend of "the big
train" was born.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.880
[Posnanskh
i think Walter Johnson

12:40.000 --> 12:41.604
very specifically
changed the game,

12:41.800 --> 12:44.406
in that he made
the fastball

12:44.600 --> 12:45.806
something large.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.447
Something larger
than life.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.802
Especially in that era,
of course that's dead ball,

12:52.040 --> 12:53.360
nobody's really
hitting home runs.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.249
The way that the game
is played

12:55.440 --> 12:57.283
is Ty Cobb
slashing through,

12:57.480 --> 13:00.324
and stealing bases
and it was a very rough game.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.682
And here was this
little bit of magic.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.242
This one guy who was a
very modest individual,

13:06.440 --> 13:09.603
but he had this
just amazing fastball.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.000
And they'd come
from all around

13:11.080 --> 13:12.570
to see him throw.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.364
And it was
exciting to people

13:14.600 --> 13:15.601
in away
that I don't think

13:15.800 --> 13:17.609
anything really had
been before.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.963
If you have an exceptionally
good curve...

13:21.160 --> 13:22.286
Better curve ball
than a fast one,

13:22.480 --> 13:23.480
or when you get out there

13:23.600 --> 13:24.761
and a base hit
might hurt you,

13:24.960 --> 13:26.610
in a ball game
when a good batter up

13:26.800 --> 13:28.006
or something like that,

13:28.240 --> 13:29.241
well then you want
to throw him a curve

13:29.440 --> 13:30.407
if you have
a real good curve.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.487
If you have
a better fast one,

13:31.680 --> 13:32.727
than you have a curve,

13:32.920 --> 13:34.160
if you have
a real good fastball

13:34.200 --> 13:35.361
and not
a very good curve,

13:35.560 --> 13:38.040
why I'd throw him
the fastball.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.127
[Posnanskh now people
are starting to say,

13:39.320 --> 13:41.561
"well, how fast is lt?"

13:41.800 --> 13:44.087
And as time goes on,
that becomes

13:44.280 --> 13:47.409
a really important part
of the game.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.887
The earliest known
measurements of pitching speed

13:50.080 --> 13:52.765
were actually made
back in 1912.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.371
Who knows
how to do that right

13:54.600 --> 13:55.600
is the military,

13:55.720 --> 13:57.051
because they have
a century

13:57.240 --> 13:59.891
of measuring things
like musket balls.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.570
So the first measurements
were made

14:01.760 --> 14:06.163
at the Remington armory
on their ballistics range.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.561
At the age of 24,

14:07.760 --> 14:09.683
dressed
in his church clothes,

14:09.880 --> 14:12.360
Walter Johnson walked
into the Remington rifle range

14:12.560 --> 14:13.891
and became the first pitcher

14:14.120 --> 14:17.283
to ever have his fastball
measured scientifically.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.370
So Walter Johnson
walks into a large room.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.201
He sees a 2-foot by 2-foot
wooden frame.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.561
And within that wooden frame

14:25.800 --> 14:28.121
are a series
of thin copper wires.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.522
15 feet further down

14:32.760 --> 14:35.969
there's a plate
on a stand

14:36.160 --> 14:38.891
so Walter Johnson's job
is to pitch the ball

14:39.080 --> 14:41.048
so it passes
through the copper wires

14:41.240 --> 14:44.244
which break a wire,
sends a signal to the clock.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.970
And starts the timing.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.528
The ball then hits the plate
15 feet further back.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.405
That gives us a start time
and a stop time.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.602
We know the distance
is 15 feet.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.644
So one can compute
the speed of the baseball.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.687
They do the throw,
they make the measurement

15:03.920 --> 15:06.287
and it comes up
with a very famous,

15:06.480 --> 15:09.484
122 feet per second.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.283
Johnson's speed
was met with astonishment.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.600
And from that point forward,

15:16.680 --> 15:18.125
the big train
was crowned

15:18.320 --> 15:22.120
the fastest pitcher
of all time.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.004
[Posnanskh nobody had ever
seen anything like him.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.487
And the game had
this new kind of hero.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.523
This new kind
of mythology.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.563
That they
could build and he...

15:30.760 --> 15:34.242
I think he's the one
that really started it.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.205
122 feet per
second was a magic number

15:37.400 --> 15:38.765
in aworld
where human beings

15:39.000 --> 15:42.368
weren't yet measured
in miles per hour.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.244
A century later

15:44.440 --> 15:47.808
we'd represent that
measurement like this...

15:48.000 --> 15:48.762
That comes out to be

15:48.960 --> 15:53.488
83.2 miles per hour.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.049
The fastball is probably
the easiest thing to see

16:07.240 --> 16:09.083
because we have
a radar gun.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.322
But it's probably
the hardest thing to scout.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.526
You know, you're looking
at what the number says now

16:18.720 --> 16:20.131
and you're
trying to figure out

16:20.320 --> 16:22.368
what the number's
gonna say in the future.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.800
And these guys that you'll see
sitting behind home plate,

16:24.040 --> 16:26.805
that's what
they're so good at.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.168
It could be a high
school guy throwing 86.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.203
But you see a fluid arm.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.731
You see looseness.

16:32.920 --> 16:33.762
And you know
that there's gonna be

16:33.960 --> 16:36.201
more there
in the future.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.926
Every scout ls on
the hunt for the fastball.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.201
With that elusive quality

16:40.400 --> 16:43.165
they call,
"electricity."

16:43.360 --> 16:45.044
I don't know
if you see "electricity."

16:45.240 --> 16:47.242
I think it's something
that you feel.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.891
Those are the guys,
the hitters all know,

16:49.080 --> 16:51.401
the dugout lights up,
everything stops.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.126
Everybody makes sure
they're looking to see that guy.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.283
It almost looks like

16:56.480 --> 16:58.209
they're throwing a different
ball than everybody else.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.405
Hannellh electric stuff
explodes at the plate.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.489
When the guys are warming up
in the bullpen

17:04.680 --> 17:06.489
it sounds like a shotgun
was just fired.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.011
When they... when it hits
the catcher's mitt.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.280
You know it
before the game.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.805
Now you start
getting excited.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.367
We're all searching
for that guy

17:13.560 --> 17:15.085
with the big power fastball

17:15.280 --> 17:17.123
that could walk out and say,
"it's game over."

17:17.319 --> 17:19.641
And basically do it
with one pitch.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.207
That's what
we're all chasing after.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.528
That's what we're spending
eight nights in a row

17:24.720 --> 17:25.960
out searching.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.288
Watching one game,
driving five hours,

17:28.520 --> 17:30.090
waking up the next day driving five hours.
We'll find...

17:30.280 --> 17:33.489
We're looking
for that guy.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.604
That premium, elite, electric
fastball's a holy grail.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.488
M the early years
of the 21 st century,

17:42.680 --> 17:45.047
Cuba was the only place
on earth off limits

17:45.240 --> 17:47.766
to American
baseball scouts.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.082
But it was from a town
in eastern Cuba

17:50.280 --> 17:52.044
just about the size
of weiser, Idaho,

17:53.080 --> 17:54.080
that word began
to spread

17:54.240 --> 17:56.527
of a kid named
aroldis Chapman.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.886
Who might some day
lay claim

17:58.080 --> 17:59.809
to the title held
by Walter Johnson

18:00.000 --> 18:02.048
100 years earlier.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.049
The fastest
to ever throw a ball.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.563
There's a certain
amount of myth around him.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.842
The hardest thrower,
you know, on the planet.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.920
When he showed up,
i remember the first game,

18:17.960 --> 18:20.201
we were bringing him in,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.811
and he came in throwing...

18:22.000 --> 18:23.490
It was
just hard to fathom,

18:23.680 --> 18:27.082
it was 102, 103,
104 mile an hour fastball.

18:28.120 --> 18:32.444
I'd never seen that.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.165
That was the “wow” moment.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.330
No chance.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.046
Ballgame! Ph ew!

18:45.240 --> 18:46.730
Sometimes you go up there
and take one pitch,

18:46.920 --> 18:48.251
you can hear
the ball go past you.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.883
- Oh yeah, you can hear that...
- Boom!

18:54.080 --> 18:55.764
"Gosh, I gotta get
the heck out there.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.566
I ain't ready
for this."

18:58.760 --> 19:01.081
That's good 0l.'
Country hardball right there.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.606
See ya later.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.290
The number one thing
going through my head is,

19:04.480 --> 19:06.084
I don't wanna die,
you know what I mean?

19:06.280 --> 19:07.805
Him throwing a pitch
that hard

19:08.040 --> 19:10.327
and you know, sometimes
he gets a little wild.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.571
Put it m, aroldis Chapman!

19:33.760 --> 19:36.161
The forward roll!

19:36.400 --> 19:38.971
Just three weeks after
comme-to the major leagues,

19:39.160 --> 19:40.924
Chapman wrote a number
on the radar gun

19:41.120 --> 19:43.009
that had never
been seen before.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.801
When he hit 105,

19:50.040 --> 19:52.850
I looked at that and I said,
at this moment,

19:53.080 --> 19:54.525
I think I've seen something
I'll never see again.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.006
And if I do see it again,

19:56.200 --> 19:58.009
it'll only be
from this pitcher here.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.802
Swing and a miss!

20:39.720 --> 20:41.440
We had a great hall of famer
just pass away,

20:41.560 --> 20:42.721
Bob feller.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.400
I mean... and they
talked about him...

20:44.560 --> 20:46.562
They timed it
with a motorcycle.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.007
Or he says that at 104.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.645
I mean,

20:50.840 --> 20:52.800
I mean, did you know people
that talked about him?

20:52.880 --> 20:54.291
Oh yeah,
i played with guys

20:54.520 --> 20:56.727
that faced feller
when he was in his prime.

20:56.920 --> 20:57.960
And said
he was unhittable.

20:58.080 --> 20:58.842
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.326
Ted Williams always said

21:00.520 --> 21:02.329
he was the toughest pitcher
he ever seen.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.931
Well, that's
enough right there.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.400
Yes, that's
exactly what he said.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.769
This husky teenager
is Robert William Andrew feller

21:13.000 --> 21:14.525
of Van meter, Iowa.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.688
That fastball was famous
all over the state

21:16.920 --> 21:18.445
when he was a schoolboy.

21:18.640 --> 21:22.008
He struck out 23 in a sandlot
game at the age of 16.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.486
And at 17
he was signed

21:23.680 --> 21:26.331
by the Cleveland Indians
in 1936.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.760
In his first
major league start,

21:27.960 --> 21:30.327
he struck out
15 St. Louis browns,

21:30.520 --> 21:31.931
and two years later
set a record

21:32.120 --> 21:34.691
by striking out
18 Detroit tigers.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.486
[Posnanskh Bob feller, when
he comes m as a 17 year old,

21:37.680 --> 21:41.366
in the 1930s,
he's just a high school kid

21:41.560 --> 21:43.005
coming out
and just... and just

21:43.200 --> 21:44.850
throwing
these incredible fastballs

21:45.040 --> 21:48.283
that are frightening
major leaguers.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.643
In every one of
feller's first seven full seasons,

21:51.840 --> 21:54.491
he led the American league
in strikeouts.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.365
And caused people
to reconsider the very limit

21:57.560 --> 22:00.245
of what a human arm
could do.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.363
[Posnanskh he's a unique
character m this story.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.848
Bob feller was
the first guy to really try

22:06.040 --> 22:09.123
to find out how fast
the fastball went.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.607
People, you know, had
a reference point already

22:11.800 --> 22:14.929
and so the question was,
faster than Walter Johnson,

22:15.120 --> 22:17.043
that was...
That was the point.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.925
And he does all of these
different things.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.441
He races a motorcycle
with a fastball.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.405
He tries to throw it
through some army contraption.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.967
Bob feller,
pitcher for the Cleveland Indians

22:28.200 --> 22:29.247
takes time off
in the nation's capital

22:29.440 --> 22:31.886
to demonstrate
his cannonball delivery.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.726
In 1946, Bob feller's speed
was measured

22:34.920 --> 22:37.491
in an experiment done
on a baseball diamond,

22:37.680 --> 22:40.604
by bringing in
a fairly modern device,

22:40.800 --> 22:45.010
that used light beams as a start
timer and the stop timer.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.328
It is recorded by the army
ordinance department

22:47.520 --> 22:49.363
lumiline chronograph.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.211
He threw
from the pitcher's mound,

22:52.400 --> 22:53.367
through the opening
in this box

22:53.600 --> 22:54.806
at home plate.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.162
And the device measured
his speed at this point

22:57.360 --> 23:01.888
with a speed
of 98.6...

23:02.080 --> 23:03.286
Miles per hour.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.806
While Walter Johnson

23:05.000 --> 23:06.047
has traditionally
been considered

23:06.280 --> 23:07.770
the fastest pitcher
who ever lived,

23:07.960 --> 23:10.247
bullet Bob left a
scientifically timed record

23:10.440 --> 23:12.283
for future generations
to shoot at.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.960
98 and 6/10
miles per hour.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.806
Feller pitched
in the 19308 and the 19408.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.042
I mean,
Bob feller started,

23:20.240 --> 23:23.210
basically when Jesse Owens
won gold medals in Germany.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.801
And at the time
there was no question

23:26.000 --> 23:28.970
that Jesse Owens
was a quantum leap forward

23:29.160 --> 23:30.366
in track.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.130
They looked
at Jesse Owens and said,

23:32.320 --> 23:35.210
you're not gonna get
any faster, any stronger,

23:35.400 --> 23:36.890
you're not gonna jump
any further,

23:37.080 --> 23:40.243
this is the limit of what
human beings can do.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.766
And of course it wasn't.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.964
The times that Jesse
Owens ran in 1936

23:45.160 --> 23:46.571
are high school times now.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.489
And that's the way it is
across the board.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.762
Every record
has been smashed.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.566
So if you brought
that along in baseball,

23:53.760 --> 23:54.966
if you looked
at it that way,

23:55.200 --> 23:58.363
and Bob feller
was throwing 98.6,

23:58.560 --> 24:02.849
if you brought that timing
with us for 70 years,

24:03.080 --> 24:05.970
people would be throwing
120 miles an hour.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.288
How come nobody
has been able to find

24:08.480 --> 24:09.288
a new way
to throw a fastball

24:09.480 --> 24:14.327
that's 20 miles an hour
faster than anybody else?

24:14.520 --> 24:15.521
It doesn't exist.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.045
Baseball starts an d stops

24:28.240 --> 24:31.528
with the starting pitcher.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.720
I love my fastball.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.609
I love it.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.406
Lot of 95s, 96s.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.206
Some 97s.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.370
For the most part, I'll probably
sit around 94, 95.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.288
If I need a big pitch,

24:50.480 --> 24:52.209
more often times
than not,

24:52.400 --> 24:53.890
I'm gonna throw
a fastball.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.166
There's no better feeling

24:59.360 --> 25:01.601
than throwing
a fastball by somebody.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.570
Especially
for strike three.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.330
You know what the
fastest pitch you ever threw

25:11.520 --> 25:12.851
in the major leagues is?

25:13.040 --> 25:16.965
I think it was
in 2010 in Detroit.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.328
I faced jhonny peralta.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.443
It was in the fifth inning.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.849
I was over 100 pitches so I knew
this was gonna be my last inning.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.081
And the 0-2.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.725
Swing and a miss.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.645
He just threw it right by him
at 100 miles an hour.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.041
I definitely looked up there

25:32.240 --> 25:34.481
and it said 100.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.245
Aw, I mean,

25:36.440 --> 25:38.681
I never envisioned myself
throwing 100 mile an hour.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.530
I mean, that's...

25:40.760 --> 25:42.967
That's crazy.
And everybody was like,

25:43.160 --> 25:47.370
"aw, you know, that gun's juiced."
Guys razzed me a little bit but...

25:47.600 --> 25:49.204
No, if that radar gun
reads a hundo,

25:49.440 --> 25:51.522
that's...
That's what I threw.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.930
Gibson th rew hard,

25:55.120 --> 25:57.566
but he threw
the hardest low fastball

25:57.760 --> 25:58.966
of anybody
I'd ever seen.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.486
You know, koufax
and those guys you know,

26:00.680 --> 26:01.681
are up here,
around there.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.211
But Gibson could
get it down here,

26:03.400 --> 26:04.840
I guarantee you
it's still around 100

26:05.040 --> 26:07.281
when he got it
right around in the knees.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.970
I couldn't believe it, that's when
i first got to the big leagues.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.083
I'd never seen
that before, you know?

26:11.280 --> 26:12.725
I mean, never. And then I swung
at it, I couldn't handle it.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.689
Joe, let me
ask you a question,

26:14.920 --> 26:17.161
- were you ever fearful that he'd hit you?
- No no no.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.964
- Didn't he have the reputation of
just hitting people? - Oh, heck yeah.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.003
But he was never wll_n.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.248
It was one of those things if
you hit a home run off of him...

26:23.440 --> 26:25.010
Well, he walked up, he would
walk up to the cage before the game,

26:25.200 --> 26:27.328
- and say, "I'm gonna get you today."
- Yeah.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.201
He told hitters "I'm gonna get
you today, and he hit 'em.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.731
I hear all of
these wild stories

26:45.920 --> 26:48.571
about the way
people saw me.

26:48.760 --> 26:51.206
And that the things
that I did...

26:51.400 --> 26:54.165
I heard that
i threw at people.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.044
“Yeah, you're always
throwing at people.”

26:56.240 --> 26:58.766
no, the people
i threw at, I hit.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.724
I'd never threw at a guy
and not hit him.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.324
If you're actually
trying to hit a guy,

27:06.560 --> 27:07.925
I would say
that you would probably

27:08.120 --> 27:09.485
aim at his ribs.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.001
He can move his head,
he can move his legs,

27:12.200 --> 27:13.770
but the middle part
of his body

27:13.960 --> 27:15.450
is very difficult
to move.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.481
That was Bob Gibson.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.207
He believe in having
part of the plate

27:24.400 --> 27:26.050
and you had
to give it to him.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.481
You know, I mean,
and he threw very hard.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.366
I always thought about it.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.245
It always was in the back
of my mind that one day

27:35.440 --> 27:36.441
he's gonna turn loose one

27:36.640 --> 27:39.041
and come
upside my head with it.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.321
You know, I felt...

27:43.840 --> 27:45.490
Bob Gibson told me

27:45.720 --> 27:48.121
one of the greatest quotes
that I've ever heard.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.243
He said,
"half of that plate's mine."

27:50.480 --> 27:52.084
And he said,
"now you gotta figure out

27:52.280 --> 27:54.851
which half
I'm coming after."

27:55.040 --> 27:57.168
He was just a
great competitor.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.050
His whole disposition,
you know

27:59.280 --> 28:03.285
that he wanted it more than
the hitter wanted to hit him.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.766
And he got tougher

28:04.960 --> 28:06.291
he could reach
back inside

28:06.480 --> 28:09.211
and get a little bit more
when he needed to.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.765
I hit a squibber.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.288
The cue shot it up the middle
for an rbi single,

28:14.480 --> 28:16.608
and the next at bat,
he drove me in the arm.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.081
Boom. Right there.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.123
I still have a mark.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.288
He tells me now, because
I've said it a lot of times

28:25.480 --> 28:26.600
on the air,
you hear about...

28:26.760 --> 28:29.206
He says, "i didn't hit nearly as many
guys as you guys think. Look it up."

28:29.400 --> 28:31.368
- Gibson would look in like this.
- Yeah.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.728
- He couldn't see though.
- He couldn't see. And that's what...

28:33.920 --> 28:36.082
All of a sudden the catcher's putting
a sign down in the shadows,

28:36.280 --> 28:38.044
he couldn't see.
And Bobby going like that.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.765
And the hitters
the next day say,

28:39.960 --> 28:42.008
"why in the hell are you
looking at me like that?"

28:42.240 --> 28:45.005
And Bob said, "man, maybe
I'll just do it every time.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.651
Whether I can see
or not."

28:50.440 --> 28:53.011
Since the day i
turned 19 years 0l_l:>,

28:53.200 --> 28:55.646
I haven't had
really good eyesight.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.604
And I wore glasses.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.161
Never on the field.
But I wore glasses.

29:00.360 --> 29:03.011
And I would look in...

29:03.200 --> 29:05.965
And try to see the sign.

29:06.160 --> 29:09.243
So the intimidating factor,

29:09.440 --> 29:12.250
um, I think
it's the way I look. Period.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.840
I think one
of the reasons

29:19.040 --> 29:22.123
that they viewed me
as this ogre,

29:22.360 --> 29:24.362
is because I was
a black kid.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.766
White kids did
the same thing

29:25.960 --> 29:27.928
and nobody
even thought about it.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.160
But I did it and...
"Ooh, we're around this guy..."

29:30.240 --> 29:32.402
You know,
"this monster."

29:32.600 --> 29:34.841
And that wasn't
gonna hold me back.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.721
And I don't imagine I did anything
to dispel any of that, you know.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.247
But I don't know
where that image came from.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.286
I guess it was
because I was who I was.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.289
You're not an
angry guy, you're not a...

29:47.480 --> 29:48.970
I'm not angry now,
i was then.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.924
We never got any runs.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.281
Well, anger came from racism.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.931
Of course it did.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.442
But racism was a way of life
that...

30:03.640 --> 30:05.130
It was stuff
that I had to deal with

30:05.360 --> 30:07.124
on a day-to-day basis.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.080
I didn't every once and
a while go somewhere

30:09.280 --> 30:11.362
and then all of a sudden
there it was.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.289
No. It was there
and it followed me

30:13.480 --> 30:14.845
all the way
through my childhood.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.128
And not just
through the childhood,

30:17.320 --> 30:20.085
through the first part
of my major league career.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.647
It was there.

30:22.880 --> 30:27.010
That fueled
a lot of the anger

30:27.200 --> 30:29.521
that I suppose
i projected.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.603
I don't know.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.165
I'd have to be
on the outside looking in.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.522
All I knew
was the way I felt.

30:35.720 --> 30:38.485
And I felt
that I had to be better

30:38.680 --> 30:40.887
in order to get
just as far

30:41.080 --> 30:42.844
and I was determined
to do that.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.569
M 196s,

30:47.760 --> 30:50.206
Bob Gibson delivered
what by many measures

30:50.400 --> 30:52.971
was the greatest season
any pitcher ever had

30:53.200 --> 30:54.804
in major league baseball.

30:56.840 --> 31:01.880
M 196a, I was m
a zone that entire year.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.651
At the age of 32
i was probably

31:04.880 --> 31:07.406
as bright

31:07.600 --> 31:09.364
as I ever was
gonna be.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.689
I was strong
as I ever was.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.326
I had complete control

31:15.560 --> 31:17.767
over the game.

31:17.960 --> 31:22.010
I felt like I could throw the ball
anywhere I wanted to throw it.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.123
That's the zone
that I was in.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.647
And I was in the zone
for a complete year.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.888
Which is kinda unusual.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.004
You might be that way
for a game or two,

31:32.240 --> 31:33.810
but not for a full year.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.490
Hoot wow 22 games.

31:35.680 --> 31:39.207
Including a record 13
complete game shutouts.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.609
His earned run average became one
of baseball fans' magic numbers.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.849
Like Hank Aaron's
755 home runs.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.283
Or DiMaggio's 56 game
hitting streak.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.289
1.12.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.482
A staggering 35% lower

31:53.720 --> 31:55.529
than the next best figure
ever recorded

31:55.760 --> 31:57.330
in the live ball era.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.801
You know, you talk
about angry, that look...

32:00.000 --> 32:02.970
I lost nine games
that year.

32:03.160 --> 32:06.004
Because if it wasn't
a one to nothing game,

32:06.200 --> 32:07.804
I didn't win.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.890
And I would sit
by myself on the bench

32:11.080 --> 32:12.200
and nobody
would come near me

32:12.280 --> 32:14.009
because I was pissed off.

32:14.240 --> 32:17.289
You know,
just get me a run.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.323
And my roommate,
curt flood,

32:19.520 --> 32:20.851
we'd get one run,
and he'd say,

32:21.080 --> 32:22.730
"okay, roomie,
we got it, hold 'em."

32:22.960 --> 32:24.325
He thought that was funny

32:24.520 --> 32:27.205
but that was
not funny at all.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.404
M game one 0f
the 196s world series,

32:30.600 --> 32:33.171
hoot capped it off with the
most dominating performance

32:33.360 --> 32:34.885
in series history.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.650
A 1-2 pitch to cash.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.684
Struck him out
on a blazing fastball.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.644
A 2-2 pitch
to mcauliffe.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.003
Struck him out.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.761
Got him!

32:48.960 --> 32:50.200
Struck him out!

32:50.440 --> 32:51.771
The 11th strike out.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.047
He struck him out
swinging.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.040
Once again
a standing ovation.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.720
A new world series record.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.405
Certainly, you know,

33:07.600 --> 33:10.171
17 strikeouts was...

33:12.080 --> 33:13.809
I guess
it's still a record.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.490
In the world series.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.449
And he can end it all now

33:17.680 --> 33:20.763
with the most dramatic
of flourishes.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.804
He got it,
struck him out!

33:24.000 --> 33:27.686
Look at the scene on the field.
Mccarver's the first one.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.405
A new world record

33:29.600 --> 33:33.127
of 17 strikeouts
in one game.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.805
Doing what you no,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.685
and knowing
that you're good at it.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.291
That's the great feeling.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.811
Not just playing ball,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.207
but I knew
that I was good at it.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.526
And I could do

33:44.720 --> 33:45.846
pretty much
what I wanted to

33:46.080 --> 33:48.003
at a certain point
in my career.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.964
And that's
a wonderful feeling.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.524
Nobody's gonna
give me anything.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.643
I need to work for it.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.289
The fans here in Atlanta

34:13.480 --> 34:15.244
treat the last three outs
of the game

34:15.440 --> 34:17.886
unbelievably.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.366
To say
i don't hear them,

34:19.560 --> 34:22.928
I'd be lying,
'cause I do.

34:23.159 --> 34:27.449
It pumps me up,
makes me excited.

34:27.639 --> 34:30.643
When the fans
are behind you,

34:30.880 --> 34:32.484
your body takes over.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.571
It's hard to explain.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.449
But seems like
it happens every time.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.568
You have complete trust
in yourself

34:44.760 --> 34:45.841
that if I throw
this pitch,

34:46.040 --> 34:48.850
I'm gonna get
the guy out.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.884
You need to believe that you're
gonna throw a pitch for a strike

34:52.080 --> 34:54.321
or maybe throw it
by a guy.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.080
That's just
the way of thinking

34:58.320 --> 34:59.526
that you have to have.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.601
There's no way
i can't strike this guy out.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.160
They played
their hearts out

35:17.280 --> 35:19.123
for nine innings
for us to win.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.163
And for me to come in
and blow a save

35:21.360 --> 35:23.249
and lose the game
because of that,

35:23.440 --> 35:25.329
you know, in my mind,
that's unacceptable.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.281
Got mm!

35:29.520 --> 35:31.045
Swing and a miss,
it's all over.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.685
No one wants
to hit off Craig.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.530
No one's gonna say,
"man, give me a bat,

35:34.720 --> 35:36.927
I wanna go up there
and hit off of this guy."

35:37.120 --> 35:38.849
So when the ninth inning
comes around,

35:39.040 --> 35:40.201
you hope
your spot's not up.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.410
You know, he has that
little stare that he does

35:44.600 --> 35:46.602
when he's getting
ready to pitch.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.087
Definitely has
a really hard fastball.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.327
It comes at you,

35:50.520 --> 35:51.851
it can pound
the strike zone.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.764
Nine times out of ten,
it's a fastball.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.609
He is the best closer
in the game by far.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.524
Comes in
and closes the door.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.922
Washington, soon night.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.326
He wants to shove it
down your throat

36:05.520 --> 36:06.760
every single night
he faces you.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.281
His fastball is electric.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.807
M l-lls first
four seasons as a closer,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.924
Craig kimbrel led the league
in saves every year.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.202
A feat unequalled
in baseball history.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.281
But even at 99 miles an hour,

36:23.480 --> 36:24.480
no pitcher in baseball

36:24.640 --> 36:26.324
has a smaller
margin for error

36:26.520 --> 36:29.524
than the closer.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.609
You never know
what's gonna happen.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.246
It could change
in one pitch.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.726
4-4 game.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.928
Two outs here, in the
bottom of the ninth inning.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.451
And now lt'll be choo.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.051
The thing in baseball
is being a reliever,

36:41.240 --> 36:42.605
they say,
"have a short memory."

36:42.840 --> 36:44.729
But how
iapproach it is

36:44.920 --> 36:46.285
you wanna have
a short memory,

36:46.480 --> 36:47.606
but you don't
wanna forget.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.370
Two and one to choo.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.125
In the air,
left center.

36:51.320 --> 36:54.927
Oh, choo to win it.

36:55.120 --> 36:57.088
What an unbelievable
finish.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.922
I threw him a
fastball middle-away,

37:05.160 --> 37:07.447
shin-soc choo hit it
out of the ballpark.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.005
I tip my cap to him,

37:09.240 --> 37:11.720
and I just had to move on
for your next outing,

37:11.920 --> 37:13.524
and the outing
after that.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.490
What's the difference

37:31.720 --> 37:34.530
between a 92-mile an hour
fastball

37:34.720 --> 37:36.245
and a 100-mile an hour
fastball?

37:36.480 --> 37:37.481
Home runs.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.490
Probably about 92...

37:43.120 --> 37:44.690
Probably about that much.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.921
And that much can make

37:48.160 --> 37:50.083
so much of a difference.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.566
You bet.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.771
If the two pitches
were thrown together,

38:05.960 --> 38:07.405
when
the 100 mile an hour pitch

38:07.600 --> 38:09.204
reaches home plate,

38:09.400 --> 38:11.368
the 92 mile an hour pitch

38:11.600 --> 38:14.285
would still have four and a
half feet left to travel.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.404
When you
throw a 92,

38:20.600 --> 38:22.762
you can read the major
league logo on the ball,

38:22.960 --> 38:24.086
you can see the seams,
you can see all that.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.005
But when a guy
throwing a 100...

38:27.240 --> 38:29.049
It look like a golf ball.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
Good luck.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.089
It's kind
0f funny to say it,

38:35.280 --> 38:36.327
but it's night and day.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.965
92 and 100.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.083
You feel as though you have
a lot longer to hit,

38:40.280 --> 38:42.123
when actually,
you don't.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.560
The
difference between say

38:43.800 --> 38:45.882
a 90-mile an hour ball

38:46.080 --> 38:48.321
takes about 450 milliseconds
to get to plate,

38:48.520 --> 38:51.444
and a 100 mile an hour ball
takes 396 milliseconds.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.365
That 50 some odd
milliseconds

38:54.600 --> 38:56.841
is crucial brain time.

38:57.040 --> 39:01.523
50 milliseconds is an eternity
in this kind of a process.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.802
If you as a rough
estimate assume

39:04.000 --> 39:05.411
that every
synaptic connection

39:05.600 --> 39:07.443
takes about
two milliseconds,

39:07.640 --> 39:10.007
an extra
50 milliseconds or so

39:10.240 --> 39:14.962
gives you about 25 times
the number of computations.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.682
So you get about 25 times
the information.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.724
Just because you have
that extra 50 milliseconds.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.406
But at 100 miles an hour,

39:24.600 --> 39:27.285
you're given almost no time
to make a decision.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.448
And it's getting close
to that range,

39:29.640 --> 39:31.802
of where its physiologically
impossible

39:32.000 --> 39:34.321
to actually plan
the voluntary action

39:34.520 --> 39:36.124
based off
the information of the ball.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.211
When the
pitcher's mound was set

39:44.440 --> 39:46.442
at precisely
60 feet, 6 inches

39:46.640 --> 39:48.005
from home plate,

39:48.200 --> 39:51.522
the game of baseball
was set in perfect balance.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.964
A showdown between the fastest it's
humanly possible to throw a ball.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.841
And the fastest it's humanly
possible to react to it.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.003
You're not gonna have

40:04.200 --> 40:05.531
that many moments
in your life

40:05.720 --> 40:06.960
where you're
going to see

40:07.160 --> 40:09.242
the edge
of human performance,

40:09.440 --> 40:11.807
meeting the edge
of human performance.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.162
And so when they
actually do meet,

40:14.360 --> 40:16.044
it's a beautiful thing.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.048
The pitcher
is pushing the limits

40:23.240 --> 40:26.244
of how fast
a ball can go.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.244
And that limit
is coming close

40:28.480 --> 40:30.482
to the limit
of how fast

40:30.680 --> 40:33.411
a hitter can
make a decision.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.649
And so you have these two
extremes of human performance

40:36.840 --> 40:37.921
doing this kind of dance

40:38.160 --> 40:38.888
right at the edge

40:39.120 --> 40:41.009
of where their biology

40:41.200 --> 40:43.931
is constraining them.

40:44.120 --> 40:47.203
We have these very basic
events that are some on.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.926
Throwing a rock
and hitting it with a stick.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.361
And it's only
when we realize

40:52.560 --> 40:53.925
how hard these things are,

40:54.120 --> 40:58.170
how precisely balanced
batters and pitchers are,

40:58.360 --> 41:01.807
that we really come
to appreciate

41:02.000 --> 41:03.240
the beauty in this

41:03.480 --> 41:05.608
and the marvelous way
that the game is set up

41:05.800 --> 41:09.566
to make
this balance fair.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.843
The pitcher wmns up,

41:13.040 --> 41:15.520
as the pitcher's arm
swings around,

41:15.720 --> 41:18.564
the hitter's brain
can make a little prediction

41:18.760 --> 41:21.206
as to roughly
the trajectory of the ball

41:21.400 --> 41:25.041
before it's even left
the pitcher's hand.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.049
And then the pitch
is released.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.245
A 100-mile an hour
fastball reaches the plate

41:32.440 --> 41:35.011
in 396 milliseconds.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.204
Faster than the blink
of an eye.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.051
Any time that you blink,
it's by you.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.000
That's how hard the
fastball is coming to you

41:43.080 --> 41:44.923
if it's 100 miles an hour.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.565
If you blink...

41:46.760 --> 41:49.286
By you.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.170
Unlike any other sport,

41:51.400 --> 41:53.209
the game comes down
to what a person can do

41:53.440 --> 41:54.566
in less time
that it takes

41:54.760 --> 41:57.650
to say the word,
"fastball."

41:57.840 --> 41:59.604
Imagine we start a clock

41:59.800 --> 42:04.203
as the pitcher
releases the ball.

42:04.400 --> 42:07.802
That starts this propagation of
computations that happen in the brain.

42:08.040 --> 42:11.442
That trying to localize where the ball
is in space and where it's going.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.802
It tries to predict
the ball's trajectory.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.360
The ball is
moving too fast for you

42:15.480 --> 42:16.680
to even track it
with your eyes

42:16.840 --> 42:18.205
moment to moment.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.765
Your eye
is rushing ahead,

42:19.960 --> 42:22.247
to the point where you
expect to see the ball.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.680
You don't know exactly
where it's gonna be,

42:23.880 --> 42:26.360
but you're making
your best guess.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.331
And you have a couple hundred
milliseconds at best

42:29.560 --> 42:32.609
to pick the next position where
you're gonna put your eyes.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.610
So right at midway ycu get
one glance at the ball.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.370
That's
your decision point.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.244
You better be planning
your swing now

42:39.440 --> 42:41.647
if you're gonna hope
to hit the ball

42:41.840 --> 42:45.242
if you're used to seeing a ball
moving at a certain speed,

42:45.440 --> 42:46.601
let's say
90 miles an hour

42:46.800 --> 42:48.962
is your average experience
of seeing balls.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.605
That prediction
is gonna put you

42:50.800 --> 42:52.245
where the ball would be

42:52.440 --> 42:54.727
if it's traveling
at that assumed speed.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.962
You move your eyes to right where
the position of the ball should be

42:57.160 --> 42:58.764
for 90-mile an hour
fastball.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.008
But lo and behold, this
pitcher has some extra gas

43:01.200 --> 43:04.204
and they pitched it
at 103 miles an hour.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.890
It left
the pitcher's hand,

43:06.080 --> 43:07.047
you look where it should be
it isn't there

43:07.240 --> 43:08.480
and from your perspective

43:08.680 --> 43:10.284
it's almost as if
it disappeared.

43:10.520 --> 43:13.569
Poof. It's gone.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.445
When the ball got to
5o feet, it disappeared.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.608
It was almost like
a jet taking off.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.484
All of a sudden...
Woo!

43:20.680 --> 43:22.170
You could lose
a baseball

43:22.360 --> 43:26.524
between the pitcher's hand
and it getting on you.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.007
Your brain tells you to swmcs.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.009
You knew you were gonna
make contact

43:31.200 --> 43:32.770
and then you swing
and miss

43:33.000 --> 43:35.480
and your brain goes,
"why'd you miss?"

43:38.000 --> 43:40.526
If you think about the
process 0f visual perception

43:40.760 --> 43:43.491
what you're really doing is looking
at the positions of the ball

43:43.720 --> 43:45.165
and making a best guess
all the time

43:45.360 --> 43:47.203
about where
it's likely to be.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.767
So if things happen
that you didn't anticipate,

43:49.960 --> 43:52.645
all sorts of optical illusions,
essentially can happen.

43:52.840 --> 43:54.251
So one of the ones
that can happen for the batter

43:54.480 --> 43:56.369
is that the ball
can completely disappear.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.800
And the 2-2.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.082
Swing and a miss.
It's all over.

44:00.320 --> 44:03.722
Our brain does a really
good job of filling in gaps

44:03.920 --> 44:06.002
between the things
that we see

44:06.240 --> 44:07.890
and sort of allows us
to tell a story

44:08.120 --> 44:10.521
that makes sense
about what happened.

44:10.720 --> 44:13.485
In that case where the ball is
faster than your eye movements,

44:13.680 --> 44:16.001
the batter fails
to reacquire

44:16.200 --> 44:18.009
the visual image
of the ball.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.726
And the ball is now sort of beyond
the point where he thought it was.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.331
He's gonna look
to a particular spot

44:22.520 --> 44:24.329
and expect the ball
to be there

44:24.520 --> 44:26.124
and the ball's
not there.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.971
Now there's almost an
error message that occurs

44:29.160 --> 44:32.209
and there has to be
a new telling of the story.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.522
One story that
batter's brains create

44:34.720 --> 44:35.801
is that
the fastest pitchers

44:36.000 --> 44:38.207
can actually
make their fastball rise

44:38.440 --> 44:40.602
as it approaches
home plate.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.484
Koufax, he threw
a fastball

44:42.680 --> 44:45.081
and that ball
would start here

44:45.320 --> 44:46.560
and by the time
you swing at it,

44:46.640 --> 44:49.291
it would hop
a little bit up here.

44:49.480 --> 44:52.723
You watch the
ball leave l-lls hand,

44:52.960 --> 44:57.443
and then when you get ready
to swing at it, it rises.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.325
2-2 pitch to
Parrish, got him swmeuue.

45:00.520 --> 45:01.601
Dwight gooden,

45:01.840 --> 45:02.921
he had a lot of jump
and movement

45:03.120 --> 45:04.326
on the ball upward.

45:04.520 --> 45:05.920
There's very few guys
that get that.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.969
You can know
a fastball's coming,

45:08.160 --> 45:10.527
but it had
that upward rising to it.

45:10.720 --> 45:13.246
And I could almost feel
the sting hit my mustache.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.686
That ball
really scared me.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.248
You know,
because you lost it.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.448
Scientists
say it can't happen.

45:20.640 --> 45:22.369
The ball can't rise.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.085
I don't know, I don't think
they ever played baseball.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.606
I don't think they did.

45:27.240 --> 45:31.723
It may not sound logical,
but it rises.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.410
And...

45:33.600 --> 45:35.125
I don't want to get
into an argument

45:35.320 --> 45:37.049
with a scientist
about that.

45:37.240 --> 45:40.210
I have to say that in some
cases they make a mistake.

45:40.400 --> 45:43.449
It wasn't impossible for it
to happen, because it did.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.404
You come over the top

45:45.600 --> 45:48.251
and you hold
a four-seamer this way.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.125
You got one,
two, three, four.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.685
Across the seams.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.211
It did go up
a little bit.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.687
You have
to throw pretty hard.

45:56.880 --> 46:01.090
Those guys that throw
80s and 89, 90,

46:01.320 --> 46:03.209
that ball's
not gonna go up.

46:03.440 --> 46:06.649
Chapman, I guarantee you his
ball goes up a little bit.

46:06.840 --> 46:09.605
Devastating fastball,
that has that late life.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.882
It's impossible.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.122
You believe that
the rising fastball's impossible?

46:14.320 --> 46:16.527
Yeah, I believe
it's impossible.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.720
But I think... you know, I don't think
it's possible for a fastball to rise.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.531
But I think it's
possible for a ride.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.165
You know, something
that's different.

46:24.360 --> 46:27.967
Well, I tried to get
the ball to ride.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.810
You know, if you talk
to a physicist,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.128
he says a ball
does not rise,

46:32.320 --> 46:35.483
but it does not drop
as fast as others.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.886
You hear guys that say

46:37.080 --> 46:39.731
they have
"good ride through the zone."

46:39.920 --> 46:41.570
You know,
it's just a natural spin.

46:41.760 --> 46:44.161
You know, 12 to 6,
just like this.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.970
Once the ball
leaves the pitcher's hand,

46:46.160 --> 46:47.600
the dominant force
acting on the ball

46:47.760 --> 46:49.120
is the one
we're all familiar with,

46:49.200 --> 46:50.440
it's the force of gravity.

46:50.640 --> 46:52.642
So the ball drops.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.411
Something like that.

46:55.600 --> 46:58.001
For a 90-mile per hour
fastball,

46:58.200 --> 47:00.202
it's going to drop
about three feet

47:00.400 --> 47:01.811
if the only force
on the ball

47:02.040 --> 47:03.883
was the force
of gravity.

47:04.080 --> 47:07.004
But a four-seam fastball
has a strong backspin on it.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.090
That creates a Magnus force
that's pushing upwards

47:10.280 --> 47:11.884
so the ball still drops,

47:12.080 --> 47:14.924
but it drops slower
than it would.

47:15.120 --> 47:16.645
And the trajectory
the ball takes

47:16.840 --> 47:18.365
is something like that.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.204
It actually crosses
home plate

47:20.440 --> 47:23.364
about 10 inches higher.

47:23.560 --> 47:26.962
If this is what a qo-mile per
hour fastball looks like,

47:27.160 --> 47:29.766
think about
a 100-mile per hour fastball,

47:29.960 --> 47:31.200
perhaps
with a stronger backspin

47:31.400 --> 47:32.765
and more Magnus force,

47:32.960 --> 47:35.691
it will have
a higher trajectory

47:37.920 --> 47:39.206
and cross home plate

47:39.400 --> 47:41.482
inches above

47:41.680 --> 47:43.045
th e Stan dard
four-seam fastball.

47:43.240 --> 47:46.926
The visual was
that it would kind of ride,

47:47.120 --> 47:48.804
it would kind of like
ride up and away from you.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.331
You swing
at that fastball...

47:50.520 --> 47:51.851
How could I not
hit that pitch?

47:52.040 --> 47:54.042
Every... it always gets
on top of my bat.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.687
Now that's a fastball
that's hard to hit.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.041
Physics tells us

47:59.240 --> 48:00.844
the ball is really moving
in a smooth arc

48:01.040 --> 48:02.166
throughout it's trajectory.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.731
The problem is,
if we go back

48:03.920 --> 48:06.241
to the first half
of the pitch,

48:06.480 --> 48:09.086
there's very little difference
in the trajectories

48:09.320 --> 48:11.800
between a-100 mile per hour
fastball,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.890
and a 90-mile per hour
fastball.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.480
And it's the beginning
of the pitch

48:16.600 --> 48:18.409
the batter has to use

48:18.600 --> 48:22.047
to estimate where the ball's
gonna cross home plate.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.561
It's not until the ball
gets very close

48:24.760 --> 48:25.841
that he realizes

48:26.040 --> 48:27.610
that the ball
is actually up here,

48:27.840 --> 48:29.330
and this will give
the illusion

48:29.520 --> 48:33.002
that the ball pops upwards
at the very end.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.645
It's not
because it actually does,

48:34.840 --> 48:36.330
it's the difference
between where his brain

48:36.520 --> 48:38.204
is telling him
the ball is gonna be

48:38.400 --> 48:39.400
and where
it actually is

48:39.600 --> 48:43.127
when it approaches
home plate.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.288
I think scientists are crazy
if they think that.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.443
I mean...
Craig kimbrel.

48:47.640 --> 48:50.484
It looks like his fastball rises
every time he throws it.

48:50.680 --> 48:53.445
They need to grab a helmet,
grab a bat and get in the box,

48:53.640 --> 48:55.760
'cause they don't understand
what's going on up there.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.171
I wanna see
if you recognize them,

49:08.360 --> 49:10.283
even know the name.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.289
Any name on there
familiar to you?

49:12.480 --> 49:14.403
Um...

49:14.600 --> 49:17.410
Jack Smith.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.449
- That's not the one we're talking about.
- Well, I didn't know.

49:19.680 --> 49:21.091
I just said that.
I had 25% chance.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.486
I didn't wanna
say, "no."

49:24.640 --> 49:26.244
No. I mean, I don't...

49:26.480 --> 49:28.960
Steve dalkowski.

49:29.160 --> 49:30.650
Steve dalkowski?

49:30.840 --> 49:32.729
No, don't know it.

49:32.920 --> 49:34.524
How would I know it?

49:57.360 --> 49:59.044
I'll show you something.

49:59.240 --> 50:02.449
And ask you to tell me

50:02.680 --> 50:03.806
who you see on that card

50:04.000 --> 50:06.685
and tell me about him.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.649
Well, the guy
that kinda sticks out

50:12.840 --> 50:15.684
is Steve dalkowski.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.041
What is it?

50:17.280 --> 50:18.725
That guy right there,
can you...

50:18.920 --> 50:21.764
Steve dalkowski...

50:21.960 --> 50:25.487
1963 rookie stars.

50:25.680 --> 50:27.808
Oh, my god.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.690
I want you
to take a look at this card

50:29.920 --> 50:33.322
and see if there's
anybody there you've heard of.

50:33.520 --> 50:35.329
Speaking of the fastball...

50:35.520 --> 50:38.683
0l-| yeah, yeah.
This dalkowski...

50:38.880 --> 50:40.803
He's legendary.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.207
There's no man on earth

50:43.400 --> 50:47.530
that ever had
more talent. No man.

50:47.720 --> 50:50.451
There's a man that if he
could've gotten it over,

50:50.640 --> 50:53.644
I really believe he could've
just made his living

50:53.840 --> 50:55.842
just th rowing fastballs.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.886
Well, I didn't
know Steve dalkowski.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.361
I knew of him.

51:05.560 --> 51:07.369
And obviously
i came up in that era

51:07.560 --> 51:09.085
that everybody knew him

51:09.280 --> 51:10.964
and they said he was the
hardest throwing... thrower

51:11.160 --> 51:13.970
that everybody
that had ever saw him,

51:14.160 --> 51:16.003
said that.

51:16.200 --> 51:17.725
And I never saw him.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.160
But people
did talk about him.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.284
Oh, he was a legend.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.884
And you hear
all these stories about him.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.284
Like "bull
durham's" nuke laloosh.

51:37.480 --> 51:40.245
Who was based in part
on dalkowski,

51:40.440 --> 51:43.250
or sidd Finch, George
plimpton's imaginary pitcher

51:43.440 --> 51:46.205
who threw
168 miles per hour.

51:46.400 --> 51:49.085
The story of Steve dalkowski
sounds like pure myth.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.930
But it was real.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.487
Tell us what we're
looking at, what did that arm do?

51:55.680 --> 51:59.446
Threw a ball faster
than anybody that ever lived.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.847
Anybody.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.246
The nastiest I ever faced

52:03.440 --> 52:04.930
was the hardest thrower
who threw a baseball

52:05.120 --> 52:06.406
was Steve dalkowski.

52:06.640 --> 52:07.960
You know, you get
into discussions

52:08.080 --> 52:10.401
about who threw
the ball the hardest.

52:10.640 --> 52:13.530
Well, this guy will come up
in every conversation

52:13.720 --> 52:16.246
that the guys played
back in the day

52:16.480 --> 52:18.448
saw this guy throw.

52:18.640 --> 52:21.928
They 8nd that he... he was the
hardest thrower that they ever saw.

52:22.120 --> 52:23.406
And this is
hard to believe

52:23.600 --> 52:25.489
and as you get older,
the stories get bigger,

52:25.680 --> 52:27.648
but I was there.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.966
Steve and I played
together

52:29.200 --> 52:31.202
for two years
in the minor leagues.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.402
He's sort of a cult figure
in a way,

52:33.600 --> 52:36.683
because he never played
in the major leagues.

52:36.920 --> 52:39.161
We were
teammates in elmira aa.

52:39.360 --> 52:40.920
And he was running
the outfield one time

52:41.000 --> 52:42.968
and I said, "Steve, can
you throw that ball

52:43.160 --> 52:44.571
through this fence?"

52:44.800 --> 52:47.326
And it was 1x6s.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.085
He said, "i don't know."
He hadn't even warmed up.

52:49.280 --> 52:52.204
He grabbed a ball and just
fired it at the wall,

52:52.400 --> 52:53.447
and threw it
right through the wall.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.563
I said,
"i guess you can."

52:55.760 --> 52:58.411
One game,
he broke my shin guard.

52:58.600 --> 53:01.490
Split my shin guard.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.091
Another game,

53:03.320 --> 53:05.891
he broke the mask,

53:06.120 --> 53:08.691
the bar mask that I had.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.281
So after that
i got a wire mask.

53:11.480 --> 53:14.563
I said, "man, I'm not
taking any chances."

53:14.760 --> 53:17.127
But he threw
harder than...

53:17.320 --> 53:21.211
This day than any man
i ever saw in my life.

53:21.400 --> 53:23.482
Who taught
you to throw fast?

53:23.720 --> 53:27.042
You don't teach people
how to throw fast.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.811
It just comes natural.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.004
I would love to have seen
him throw at his prime.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.645
Um...

53:34.840 --> 53:37.161
Because what people
said about him,

53:37.400 --> 53:40.165
obviously he had
one of those special arms.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.530
Befitting the
legend of Steve dalkowski,

53:45.720 --> 53:49.042
no one has ever found
any footage of him pitching.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.169
Tell me about that guy.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.727
He's a good guy.

53:53.920 --> 53:56.048
Couldn't throw strikes.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.571
Yeah...

53:57.760 --> 53:59.091
He was very wild.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.645
Sometimes
when he threw BP,

54:00.880 --> 54:01.961
you know
it was questionable

54:02.160 --> 54:03.889
if he could throw it
in the cage.

54:04.080 --> 54:07.846
I was do this and the
ball would go like that.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.929
Out of control
they say.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.770
His problem was
more up and down

54:11.960 --> 54:13.325
than it was in and out.

54:13.560 --> 54:15.483
You could tell Steve
to throw the ball,

54:15.680 --> 54:17.720
"and I want you to hit
a foot in front of the plate.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.086
I want you
to throw the ball 59 feet."

54:19.280 --> 54:22.727
And the ball would be
over the catcher's head

54:22.920 --> 54:24.126
by the time
it got to the plate

54:24.360 --> 54:25.691
because his ball
had so much...

54:25.880 --> 54:28.247
He had so much backspin
on his ball.

54:28.440 --> 54:31.125
That the ball rose
that quickly.

54:31.320 --> 54:35.405
Everywhere he pitched,
he set strikeout records.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.728
But for every new mark
for strikeouts,

54:37.960 --> 54:41.009
there was another new
record f or walks.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.204
He pitched 697 innings,

54:44.400 --> 54:47.609
and had
1,099 strikeouts.

54:47.840 --> 54:50.491
And he had more walks
than he had strikeouts.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.006
By 100.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.009
Pretty amazing.

54:54.200 --> 54:57.249
You still have to throw
the ball over the plate.

54:57.480 --> 54:59.323
Could not throw a strike.

54:59.560 --> 55:01.289
Tried everything.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.966
I mean, everything.

55:04.160 --> 55:08.609
All he wanted to do was get the
fastball over and he could not do it.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.371
What a shame.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.609
Over the years, it almost
became an obsession with him

55:14.800 --> 55:16.643
to try to conquer
his control.

55:16.840 --> 55:19.002
And he was getting better.

55:19.200 --> 55:22.761
He wasn't perfect,
but he was getting better.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.968
M 1962 at elmira,

55:25.160 --> 55:28.403
under a new manager, the future
hall of famer, Earl Weaver.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.171
Dalkowski finally found
the plate.

55:31.360 --> 55:34.125
Over his final 52 innings
that summer,

55:34.320 --> 55:38.609
he struck out 104
while walking only 11.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.370
After all them years
of my life,

55:40.600 --> 55:44.446
I finally got word

55:44.640 --> 55:47.644
that I'm gonna
have the chance to make it.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.002
That felt real good.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.402
M spring training 1963,

55:52.600 --> 55:54.011
dalkowski pitched
in two games

55:54.240 --> 55:55.890
against the Dodgers
and the Yankees.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.567
Allowing no runs
and no hits.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.206
Topps printed
his baseball card.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.920
In the morning
of his final appearance,

56:03.960 --> 56:05.769
he was told
he had made the team.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.650
And was fitted
for a big league uniform

56:07.880 --> 56:10.565
for the very first time.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.609
Then with two outs
in the third inning,

56:12.840 --> 56:15.411
Steve came off the mound
to field a bunt,

56:15.640 --> 56:17.085
as he threw to first

56:17.280 --> 56:19.647
he felt a pop
in his elbow.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.808
Tell me about
walking off the field

56:22.000 --> 56:24.367
and knowing
that you are hurt.

56:25.400 --> 56:26.481
I said, "why me?"

56:26.680 --> 56:28.887
And I start crying.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.287
Yep.

56:31.480 --> 56:34.484
Steve went back
to the minor leagues.

56:34.680 --> 56:37.809
He would never throw a pitch
in the majors.

56:38.040 --> 56:41.681
I felt so bad
about him because...

56:41.880 --> 56:45.043
When he was trying
to get it back,

56:45.240 --> 56:47.242
you could walk downtown
at 1:00 in the morning

56:47.440 --> 56:49.124
and you'd find Steve sitting
down there

56:49.320 --> 56:50.845
with a bottle of wine.

56:51.040 --> 56:55.045
I mean, he... it really,
really tore at his heart.

56:57.160 --> 56:59.208
It's a shame that...

56:59.400 --> 57:02.006
That a talent like that
never got there.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.570
It's a fragile deal.

57:05.760 --> 57:09.685
And if... you know,
if the wrong thing happens,

57:09.880 --> 57:10.881
you never know.

57:12.440 --> 57:14.522
He was just somebody

57:14.720 --> 57:17.564
that was unable
to conquer his control.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.841
And it's just unfortunate

57:19.080 --> 57:21.731
that he never made
the big show.

57:21.920 --> 57:23.649
If he'd had harnessed
his control

57:23.840 --> 57:24.920
and gone
to the big leagues,

57:25.000 --> 57:26.161
I think
he would have been

57:26.360 --> 57:27.840
one of the premiere
fastball pitchers,

57:27.920 --> 57:29.649
you know,
ever in baseball.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.009
During the years
that dalkowski was struggling

57:39.200 --> 57:41.771
to just find the plate
in the minor leagues,

57:41.960 --> 57:43.610
another lefty
was working to control

57:43.800 --> 57:46.485
the lightning in his own arm
in the majors.

57:46.680 --> 57:47.886
This pitcher,
it was said,

57:48.080 --> 57:51.084
had been born
with the left arm of god.

57:51.320 --> 57:54.051
And when Sandy koufax
harnessed his gift,

57:54.280 --> 57:56.521
he became a legend.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.768
Untouchable.

57:58.960 --> 58:02.646
Boy, I mean,
it came in and it went...

58:02.840 --> 58:05.411
You could hear it go...

58:05.600 --> 58:07.728
Wow.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.485
One time he threw
a pitch in there

58:09.680 --> 58:11.808
and I said,
"ball."

58:12.000 --> 58:13.411
He got the ball back
like this.

58:13.600 --> 58:14.726
And looked in at me

58:14.920 --> 58:16.922
and he went like this
with his hand.

58:17.120 --> 58:21.125
As if to ask,
"was it too high?"

58:21.320 --> 58:22.970
And you know,
i just nodded.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.844
That's right.

58:25.040 --> 58:27.771
Next pitch, he brought
it down six inches,

58:27.960 --> 58:30.611
same thing. Zoom, zoom, wham.
Strike three.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.491
What a grand,
grand thing

58:36.680 --> 58:38.682
to sit back there
and see this.

58:45.480 --> 58:49.280
In 1965 on a late summer night
in Los Angeles,

58:49.480 --> 58:52.450
koufax took the mound
for the Dodgers.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.290
The game wasn't on TV.

58:54.480 --> 58:55.925
But the Dodgers trainer,
bill buhler,

58:56.120 --> 58:57.246
was an amateur film buff

58:57.440 --> 58:59.522
and brought his camera
to the game.

58:59.760 --> 59:02.127
He found an empty seat
behind home plate

59:02.320 --> 59:04.527
and began to roll.

59:04.720 --> 59:07.371
For decades the film sat
forgotten in a closet.

59:07.600 --> 59:11.127
Now recently uncovered
and restored.

59:11.360 --> 59:12.930
A glimpse
of Sandy koufax

59:13.120 --> 59:15.930
on a night that maybe god
himself created especially

59:16.120 --> 59:18.009
for his own left arm.

59:31.880 --> 59:33.530
Batter after batter,

59:33.720 --> 59:36.166
koufax was pitching
with mastery.

59:36.360 --> 59:37.850
Precision.

59:38.040 --> 59:39.451
Concentration.

59:39.680 --> 59:41.569
And a fastball
that split the night.

59:44.680 --> 59:46.170
With his handheld camera,

59:46.360 --> 59:49.250
the Dodgers' trainer
was capturing history.

59:49.480 --> 59:51.847
Till there were two out
in the third.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.805
And bill buhler
ran out of film.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.764
Only the 29,000 at dodger
stadium that night

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.691
actually witnessed
what happened next.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.450
Threw 82i3rds,

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.849
26 up and 26 down.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.445
And to capture
the final moments,

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.642
there was nothing
but the hall of fame voice,

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.569
of vin Scully
on the radio.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.649
Making imagination real,

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.928
and baseball
that night...

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.610
Perfect.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.406
He is one
out away from the promised land.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.928
And Harvey kuenn
is coming up.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.168
And koufax takes
a hitch at his belt

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.880
and walks
behind the mound.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.650
I would think
that the mound

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.126
at dodger stadium
right now

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.251
is the loneliest place
in the world.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.329
Sandy into his windup.
And the pitch.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.127
A fastball for a strike.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.403
And you can almost taste
the pressure now.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.761
Koufax lifted his cap,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.570
ran his fingers
through his black hair,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.048
then pulled the cap back down,
fussing at the bill.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.766
And there's 29,000 people
in the ball park

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.282
and a million butterflies.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.926
Sandy readying
a strike one pitch.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.088
Very high
and he lost his hat,

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.203
he really forced
that one.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.688
Trying to get
that little extra.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.530
You can't blame a man

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.441
for pushing
just a little bit now.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.404
Now Sandy looks in.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.251
Into his windup
and the 2-1 pitch to kuenn.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.885
Swung on and missed.
Strike two.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.282
Two and two
to Harvey kuenn.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.448
One strike away.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.085
Sandy into his windup.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.520
Here's the pitch.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.961
Swung on and missed!
A perfect game!

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.849
A warm summer night.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.850
A golden voice crackling
over the airwaves.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.090
And a fastball
no one could hit.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.770
Baseball fans
didn't have to see it

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.486
to know how it felt.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.480
Because in our minds, it was
the thing we always see.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.842
The phenom made good.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.249
The dream made real
before our eyes.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.761
The pitcher with the gift
of the fastball.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.401
Commanding the magic
in his arm.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.924
For me
it's... I don't know,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.929
I think koufax
was the most consistent

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.804
of any fastball
that I had to face.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.445
You know,
day in, day out.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.444
I say that
to all the guys,

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.444
I said, I don't think anybody
threw harder than koufax.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.967
I have to tell you a story,
i grew up in San Francisco

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.128
watching koufax
against the giants

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.810
and those guys
all the time.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.331
You know, as a kid or
something, I just would...

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.050
I just wanna
face Sandy koufax.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.730
You know, you get in your mind,
you wanna face him, right?

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.764
So my rookie year,
we're going to dodger stadium

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.440
- and koufax was gonna pitch the next day.
- It was validation.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.369
And I'm like,
"man, I can't wait."

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.483
And the guys on the bus are
looking at me like I'm crazy.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.320
"Are you stupid
or what are you wanna do?"

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.845
Right, so...

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.650
And I find out the next day
i was stupid, right?

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.491
I mean, honest,
it took me two at-bats

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.364
before I even fouled
a ball, right?

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.561
He just blew me away

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.920
the first time,
the next time,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.525
then I fouled
a ball, right?

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.330
I came back
and I told one of the guys,

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.806
I said,
"i got him now."

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.922
He struck me out, see? Right?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.480
So I go back up
and I hit a pop up.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.800
I said,
"i told you I got him."

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.170
Who's the
fastest you ever saw?

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.731
Uh, Juan berenguer.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.448
With 101.5 in AAA.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.768
And he was still throwing
about 100 for Minnesota

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.850
when I faced him.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.328
He is just pumping
some major league gas.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.524
Oh, mercy.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.200
Of all the people I've
watched over the last 4o years

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.643
I think Billy Wagner
was probably as hard a thrower

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.609
as I'd seen.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.205
Here's the pitch.
Swme and a miss

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.767
at a high fastball
at 100 miles an hour.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.883
You're not gonna
catch up to that one.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.684
I'd probably say
it's Kevin brown.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.320
I really didn't like
facing that guy.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.203
He threw hard.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.641
He just has
so many different windups.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.720
And he used to always come
high and tight on me,

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.410
I used to be...
And I was young then,

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.647
I was scared
to be in there

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.410
in the batter's box
with Kevin brown.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.680
I mean, plus everybody knew
he was kind of crazy too.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.402
Robin Roberts.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.523
And when you got
men on base,

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.688
he could throw
a little bit harder.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.451
He just reached back
and threw more.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.563
I said, "wow.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.286
Boy, this guy can
throw the ball."

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.845
Herb score.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.805
I saw score
when I was just a kid.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.480
My grandfather took me
to an exhibition game

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.449
and I never saw anybody

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.648
who could throw
the ball that hard.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.446
It's one of those things
you remember in life.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.603
The ball literally
just jumped.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.131
I couldn't
see the ball.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.687
And I told my grandfather,
i said, you know,

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.281
I've never seen anybody, grandpa,
thrcw a ball this hard."

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.644
And the young
hard thrower, Joel zumaya.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.968
The rookie into the game.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.809
Joel zumaya.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.125
It just exploded
out of l-lls hand.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.891
After the pitch was thrown
it was like by me,

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.525
and I'm like, "wow, this...
That was kinda hard.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.291
Let me look up
and see what the radar says."

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.804
And the gun said 103. And
now I'm like, "oh, my god,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.324
I gotta use all my mechanics, I gotta
get it ready early and just swing.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.370
So I got my foot down
and I'm ready to go.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.046
My eyes got
a little bigger.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.040
Swme and a miss,
he went after the curve ball.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.241
He struck him out.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.447
And then he
threw me a curve ball

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.881
and I look like bugs bunny
spinning in the ground,

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.080
it was terrible.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.403
I remember my first year.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.204
And I was 20 years old.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.609
You know, I was wide-eyed
and overwhelmed.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.121
I'm in yankee stadium
for the first time playing.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.129
I remember getting
in the box

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.685
and got
to a 3-2 count.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.684
And the catcher
says to me,

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.571
well there's no mystery what
he's gonna throw right here.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:56.486
And he struck me out
on the fastball.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.644
Percival strikes out
jeter to end the ball game.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.205
I got sent down right
after that.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.607
But just wanted
to come back

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.121
and get a chance
to redeem myself.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.810
All right, who was the hardest thrower?
Just pick one.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.967
I would say Nolan Ryan.
Nolan Ryan.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.810
Nolan Ryan.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.651
I would say Randy Johnson
and Nolan Ryan. Each side.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.127
I would say Nolan.
I mean, it was high heat.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.522
And you were... from the time
you just left the dugout

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.131
you were starting
to swing.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.880
I mean, it was just one
of those things.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.204
You know when I threw
a fastball right

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.129
and I stayed with it,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.970
I knew as soon
as it left my hand,

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.128
whether it was
the right pitch or not,

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.529
it was thrown correctly.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.410
That was a gift.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.202
Right past him, Nolan.
Right past him.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.690
There's certain guys that are
electric what I called.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.928
You don't know whether
they're gonna strike out 15

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.169
or you don't know whether
they're gonna pitch a no-hitter.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.600
And Nolan,

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.565
when he got to the big leagues
at 19 years old,

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.762
that's the kind
of guy he was.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.764
When he threw that fastball
above the waist,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.526
it just exploded.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.926
Pitching for the miracle mets

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.885
in the 1969
national league playoffs,

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:19.051
21 year old Nolan Ryan faced
home run king, Hank Aaron.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.368
I had a good series
against the mets.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.770
I hit one off seaver, I hit one off
koosman, and I hit one off gentry.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.760
Hank Aaron now has
homered m each game 0f this series.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.450
And...

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.201
And Nolan Ryan was the one
that almost hit me,

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.807
he cooled my pepper down
right here.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.606
I grew up in the era
that was understood

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.087
that 0-2,
you knocked the hitter down.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:49.330
And that you established
that you would pitch in.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.171
And that's the way
i was taught.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.365
That intimidation
is a tool that you can use.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.130
Men and tight.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.450
And I tell people that that's
a lost art nowadays.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.126
He's outta there on strikes.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.051
Nolan had
this edge about him.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.641
And he was not afraid
to throw one under your chin.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.522
I'd get goosebumps.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.529
It's ridiculous to say, but you...
I could've got hit in the head

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.246
and died at home plate
against him, you know?

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.091
There's a lot
on the line there.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.725
It's a damn scary at bat.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.684
Nolan Ryan was
my last year.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.200
And I says,
"Nolan, don't hit me."

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.288
- "I'm retiring next year,
please don't hit me." Wpleaset

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:35.685
I want to be able
to play golf

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920
when I'm retired.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.728
With the mets,
Ryan struggled to control

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.809
the lightning
in his arm.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.368
I just threw as hard as i
coul_l:> For as long as I could.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.729
There were times, you know,
that when I released the ball,

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.763
I didn't know
where it was going.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.531
It's kinda like
what Oscar gamble said,

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.643
he said, "a good
night tonight is 0-4

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.490
and don't get hit
in the head."

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.283
You know.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.687
M 1971 when the
angels called the mets

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.406
looking to trade
for pitcher Gary gentry,

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.602
the mets refused.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.962
The angels settled
for their second choice.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.447
And Nolan Ryan moved
to California.

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:20.965
Nolan Ryan,
when he first started

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.810
was incredibly wild.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.731
So when the trade came in
and the headline,

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.571
"ls he Rex Barney
or is he Sandy koufax?"

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.569
There was a lot of reason
to believe

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.761
that he was Rex Barney.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.087
The great line
about Rex Barney was

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:37.520
that he would have been
a great pitcher

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.609
if the plate had been
high and outside.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.964
And Nolan Ryan could easily
have become that.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.326
What nobody knew
about him,

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.171
and I don't even know if Nolan
Ryan knew about himself,

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:52.490
was that he had
this extreme competitiveness.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.011
So he had the great arm

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.886
and he had this just hunger
to be successful.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.606
Every single day,
every single pitch.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.002
Almost immediately,
Ryan began an assault

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.602
on baseball's
pitching records.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.731
First came the single season
mark for strikeouts.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.649
Next came the no-hitters.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.366
He popped it up.
A tough play.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.688
No-hitter for Nolan Ryan.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.644
There were a lot of times
when I was an over thrower

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.807
and that was something
i had to fight

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.490
my whole career.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.887
But once I got
control of that,

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.849
I became
more effective.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.650
And I knew
if I hit my spot,

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.922
they weren't
gonna hit it.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.771
They're rooting for
Ryan to throw one more strike.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.161
The 2-2 pitch.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.646
It's strike three called.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.930
Nolan Ryan has pitched
his fourth no-hitter.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.568
Four no-hitters
equaled Sandy koufax's record.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.603
There was no doubt
that Ryan's fastball

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.962
was the fastest
in the big leagues.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.162
The only question
that remained

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.970
was it the fastest ever?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.321
I think the three guys

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.727
who are different
from anybody else

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.641
are Walter Johnson,
Bob feller and Nolan Ryan.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.605
In the moment,
in their moment,

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.724
people saw them
as the fastest ever.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.371
When Walter Johnson
was pitching,

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.642
story after story
simply referred to him

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.406
as the fastest pitcher ever.
It was a fact.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.843
It wasn't something that anybody
threw out as an opinion.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.283
And then when feller came in,
it was the same thing.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.447
And I think
then you have to go

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.364
all the way
to Nolan Ryan

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.365
who everybody wanted
to sort of use as the example.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.730
Okay, how fast can a human
being throw a baseball?

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.809
No pitcher had ever
had l-lls fastball clocked

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.446
during an actual game.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.007
But in 1974,
the invention of the device

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.969
that would become
the radar gun

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.966
made it possible
for the first time.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.851
We have
a coherent infrared radar

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.084
located in the press box
at anaheim stadium.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.770
And we send
an infrared beam

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.721
down over the catcher
and umpire's head.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.325
They had me go out

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.443
and throw some
warm up pitches.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.762
And you know,
they had one at 74,

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.325
and then
it went up to 84,

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.409
and then I think
the highest I threw

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.041
in those five
warm up pitches was 93

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.446
and I was sitting out...
Standing out there

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.120
thinking this is gonna
be a wreck.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.448
Because it was all sheer
speculation

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.926
of what people threw.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.360
You know, you hear
this guy has

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.324
a 100-mile an hour
fastball.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.808
Bob feller was the hardest
thrower ever at 98.6.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.924
And you know,
and nobody really knew.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.164
The device was set up
to measure his pitching speed

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.284
about 10 feet
in front of home plate.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.641
And he was
actually clocked

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.566
at 100.8 miles per hour
on that night.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.165
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.091
we're pleased to announce
that Nolan Ryan,

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.124
officially is
the fastest pitcher

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.320
in baseball history.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.803
Ryan's fastest pitch
came in the ninth inning.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.844
He finished the night
with 159 pitches.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.164
Ryan was officially sanctioned
as the fastest.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400
But as time passed

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.482
what became
even more amazing

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.682
than how fast Ryan threw,

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.531
was for how long
he could throw that fast.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.882
Well, I pitched a game
against Luis tiant,

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.009
in '74,

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.522
where I threw somewhere
around 232 pitches.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.008
I walked 10
and struck out 19.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.407
Nolan had
pitched 15 innings

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.602
against the Red Sox
on Monday.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.444
And Friday
was his day to pitch

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.682
and I said,
"you want an extra day?"

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.566
He said, "no." He said,
"i wanna pitch Friday."

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.125
So I'm not gonna
tell Nolan Ryan

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.890
he needs an extra day,

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.286
that's if he wants
to pitch every fourth day,

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.601
and he went out there

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.404
and he threw
a 1-0 shutout.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.568
When I started the game,

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.331
my intent was
to finish the game.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.601
That was my game

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.370
and I didn't want to
turn it over to somebody.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.368
And if that's
what it took

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.686
that's what you did.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.451
You know, he had 77 games

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.041
where he was leading
in the seventh lnning.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.449
And he finished all 77
of them and won them.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.563
So he was
his own closer.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.802
I probably averaged
somewhere between 150

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.082
and 170 pitches
a start.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.601
And on today's,
that's unheard of.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.326
And anybody allowing
the pitcher to do that,

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.530
they'd run them
out of town.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.051
Ryan was 27 years old

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.890
and believed his days
as a fireballer

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.491
were numbered.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.445
"I don't look
for longevity," he said.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.404
"If I can escape injury,

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.761
I should be
a fastball pitcher

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.440
for another five years."

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.881
When I went to Houston
as a free agent,

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.567
in 1980, iasked
for a three year contract.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.161
'Cause I was 32 years old and i
figured you know,

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.930
in three years,

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.121
that's probably will be
a reasonable time,

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.084
I'd be out of the game.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.851
But "the Ryan express"
was just getting started.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.890
This may be m

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.321
no-hitter number five!

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.291
First he pitched
l-lls fifth career no-hitter.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:09.046
A new record.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.208
Then at age 36,

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.444
Ryan broke Walter Johnson's
all time strikeout record.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.041
A mark that had stood
for 56 years.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.760
Longer than babe Ruth's
career home run record.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.689
And there's the record breaker.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.202
3,509 strikeouts...

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.481
Five years later,

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.960
Ryan became the first
40 year old

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.321
to ever lead the league
in strikeouts.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.969
And if that wasn't enough, he led the
league in e.R.A. That same season.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.130
"The Ryan express"
continues to blow people away.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.446
He went
to the Texas rangers

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.761
and the led the league
in strikeouts

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.405
for four straight years.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.689
Including over 300
strikeouts at age 43.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.928
Called strike three.
There's 300.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.088
And the
no-hitters kept coming.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.409
Nolan's looking for
a career seventh no-hitter

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.046
at the age of 44.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.602
Number seven
is in the books.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.406
The remarkable Ryan
has done it again.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.244
[Posnanskh I think Nolan
Ryan wanted to be unhittable

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.771
every single day.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.047
I don't think Nolan Ryan

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.561
ever wanted
to concede anything.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.127
Every batter he faced,
he wanted to strike out.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.166
And there it ls, strike three.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.328
The grunt told you
it was a fastball.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.683
He put everything he had

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.370
into his fastball.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.728
Including a grunt.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.963
Nolan grunted very loud
when he threw a fastball.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.924
He threw it as hard
as he could throw it.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.610
And no one else
did that.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.848
He struck him out swinging.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.327
Strikeout number 5,000

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.808
is history
for Nolan Ryan.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.690
He just keeps
going and going and going.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.601
Until the point where he puts the
record 2,000 strikeouts ahead

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.691
and is so far ahead that nobody's
ever gonna touch that record.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.049
I mean, it's just...
It's staggering.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.323
He was still throwing 96
at that age.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.602
He was
still throwing 95, 96

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.646
and it was always
a tough at-bat.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.322
M l-lls 27th
season, at age 4e,

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.849
Ryan felt a pain
in the elbow.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.408
What happened
was I pitched in anaheim

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.729
five days earlier
and my elbow was sore.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.163
And obviously I didn't
know it at the time,

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.522
I probably had
injured my elbow.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.122
And so when I warmed up
in Seattle,

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.481
my elbow
was bothering me.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:42.925
And as I went out and tried
to pitch in the game,

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.805
I had nothing.
Gave up a grand slam.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.482
A grand slam
home run for howitt.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.803
I didn't get anybody out.
It kept getting worse.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.286
And then it just
finally popped

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.648
like a rubber band.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.320
Inside 3-1.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.921
Oh, boy.
That's not good.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.727
And I knew that lt...
That I'd had torn it.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.809
He turns to Kevin
Kennedy and that's it.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.445
Uh-oh, he's finished.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:13.281
Oh, boy.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.926
Boy, you just hope
this lsn't the way it ends.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.126
The sign says,

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.600
"Nolan, thanks
for the memories."

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.371
And the kingdome fans
are standing.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.005
It wasn't
exactly the way

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.771
I envisioned
walking off the mound

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.724
for the last time.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.648
Nolan Ryan's last fastball

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.491
was clocked
at 98 miles per hour.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.643
To compare pitchers
from different eras,

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.491
fastballs thrown
in different conditions.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.841
Measured in different ways

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.765
and marveled at
by different generations.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.047
This is the question

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.164
that every baseball fan
wants to answer.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.647
Who really threw
the fastest ever?

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.606
Today, all pitches
are clocked

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.167
at 50 feet
from home plate,

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.966
virtually the instant the ball
leaves the pitcher's hand.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.885
So 50 feet from home

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.367
was the point where
aroldis Chapman's pitch

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.689
officially registered
at 105.1.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.683
Well, physics tells us

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.009
that a ball traveling at 105.1
miles per hour at this point here

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.282
is going to slow down
considerably

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.529
as it travels
toward the batter.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.846
As the ball is moving,

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.327
it has to push the air
out of the way

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.885
so it's losing energy
to the air

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.844
and that causes it
to slow down.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.724
This is called
"drag."

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.922
So what 0f the
methods used m the speed test

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.963
for Walter Johnson,

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.571
Bob feller

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.921
and Nolan Ryan?

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.884
The three pitchers
known in their own eras

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.289
as the fastest
of all time.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.603
Walter Johnson's reading
of 83.2 miles per hour

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.529
starts to feel different
when we look closer

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.370
at the apparatus used.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.722
In which the trigger,
a wire target,

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:15.400
sat 60 feet, 6 inches
from Johnson.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.284
And the metal plate
that completed the test

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.051
was 15 feet behind that.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.129
What that means is,
you're actually computing

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.527
the average speed
of the baseball

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.803
as it passes from the
wire frame to the plate.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.444
So effectively,
you're measuring

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.484
the speed of the baseball
at this point right here,

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.926
which is
about the equivalent

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.124
of seven and half feet
behind home plate.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.564
But we're interested in the speed
of the baseball at this point here.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.127
About 50 feet
in front of home plate.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.886
Because that's our standard
point of comparison.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.570
So we have
to make a correction

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.444
for the fact
the ball's gone actually

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.007
from this point here
to this point here.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.926
A total of 50 feet
plus 7 and a half

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.208
at 57 and a half feet.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.164
At a rate
of one mile per hour

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.362
for every 5.5 feet.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.451
That makes a correction
of about 10.6 miles per hour.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.041
So we really should
be saying...

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.369
93.8 miles per hour.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.051
In 1946,
Bob feller's pitch

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.766
was measured
right at home plate.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.803
So to compare
to today's pitches.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
We have to estimate what
that pitch would have been

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.048
50 feet in front
of home plate.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.850
So that means we have
to take the 98.6,

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.609
add 9 miles per hour,

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.406
we can estimate that he
was pitching with a speed

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.844
of 107.6 miles per hour.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.084
For that pitch.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.284
Nolan Ryan's
100.9-mile per hour pitch

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.643
requires
a similar adjustment.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.770
M 1974, the
radar gun ls positioned

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.200
to pick up the speed
of the ball

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.728
about 10 feet
in front of the batter.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.520
Again, what we would
really like to know,

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.926
what that speed was

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.930
at about 50 feet
in front of home plate.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.088
To do that,
we add on

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.169
about 7 and a half
miles per hour,

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.811
and we come out
with a number

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.561
of 108.5 miles per hour.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.922
At the 50 foot mark.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.562
So we believe that once
we make corrections,

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.127
this is really
the fastest pitch recorded.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.608
[Posnanskh 60 feet, 6 inches,
it's sucl-| a weird distance.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.047
I don't know if it was luck

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.766
or if it was
just sort of this...

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.646
This sense of geometry.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.200
It just sort of felt
right to them.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.765
That felt like
the right distance,

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.486
60 feet, 6 inches.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.569
And here it is
all these years later

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.285
and it's perfect.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.209
It's absolutely perfect.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:06.322
The game, its essence
comes down to that.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.090
It's just
pitcher-hitter.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.251
"I'm gonna throw the ball
as hard as I can...

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.204
Let's see
if you can hit lt."

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.528
Struck him out!

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.331
[Posnanskh that's what
baseball's been for 12o years.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.851
Struck him
out with a fastball.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.520
[Posnanskh that's the
timelessness of the game,

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.291
and I think that's
the fastball at its core.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.684
It feels like what
was possible in 1936

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.086
is the same thing
that's possible now.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.084
It feels like
that hasn't changed.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.682
And that's part
of what's great about it.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.324
The game changes,
it moves up, it moves down.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.167
But that one thing...

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.849
Throw the ball
as hard as you can...

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.844
Just stays constant
through all.
