00:01.560 --> 00:03.039
Stella: Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.387
He gave up on me.

00:04.430 --> 00:06.034
Dad doesn't give up.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.910
With my cancer,
he never did.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.041
This is what Dad does.

00:09.090 --> 00:10.171
He swings
for the fences.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.302
Sheila in Community Outreach
just quit

00:12.360 --> 00:13.304
and left me
with a half-planned

00:13.360 --> 00:14.657
bone marrow drive.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.041
What do you need?Take the whole thing over.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.397
You're my partner,

00:17.450 --> 00:18.349
and I should have consulted you
about everything.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.617
We will find an investor
and...

00:19.670 --> 00:21.092
Look no further.
Here I am.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.881
You offered to help me
find an investor,

00:23.930 --> 00:25.364
not be the investor.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.718
I'm happy for Peter,

00:27.760 --> 00:29.103
so why am I freaking out
about signing some papers?

00:29.150 --> 00:31.107
Because divorce feels final.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.229
Why are you here?

00:32.290 --> 00:34.372
I want to help
a man I care deeply about.

00:34.420 --> 00:36.639
I guess Dr. Grant's
still in the picture.

00:39.690 --> 00:40.680
What was that?

00:40.730 --> 00:42.641
Let me watch you do
a couple...

00:42.690 --> 00:43.646
Hey. Are you okay?

00:43.690 --> 00:44.077
I got to get out of here.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.729
Wes, talk to me.

00:47.780 --> 00:48.212
I didn't mean it
to happen that way.

00:48.260 --> 00:48.909
Not ever.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.184
This is Wes Charles.
Please leave a message.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.628
Hey, it's me again.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.104
I fell asleep.

01:11.150 --> 01:12.276
Where are you?

01:21.690 --> 01:22.156
Oh, my.

01:22.210 --> 01:23.291
Oh, my, what?

01:23.340 --> 01:25.331
Oh, my,
why didn't we consider

01:25.380 --> 01:26.643
getting divorced
years ago?

01:26.690 --> 01:29.034
You wouldn't have ever
tried that move on me

01:29.080 --> 01:30.423
if we were still married.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.950
Wow.

01:40.490 --> 01:42.219
That was Gina,
wasn't it?

01:46.580 --> 01:48.799
You think I should
tell her about us?

01:48.840 --> 01:51.184
"US"?

01:51.240 --> 01:53.049
This isn't
gonna happen again.

01:53.110 --> 01:54.760
Are you sure?

01:56.420 --> 01:56.978
Are you?

01:57.020 --> 01:59.842
I don't know.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.119
What exactly are we now?

02:02.160 --> 02:05.414
Two decent people
who were married for 30 years

02:05.470 --> 02:08.246
and didn't have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.258
Think of this as a very...

02:11.300 --> 02:13.519
unusual anniversary gift.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.779
Our 31st is
right around the corner.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.605
What did I give you
for our 30th?

02:17.650 --> 02:19.789
Golf clubs.

02:19.830 --> 02:20.956
Right.

02:21.010 --> 02:24.264
That explains so much.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.766
Hey, Stell, what's up?

02:45.810 --> 02:48.120
Is that party
still happening?

02:48.160 --> 02:49.685
Nah, I threw
the last drunk guy out

02:49.730 --> 02:50.891
an hour ago.

02:50.950 --> 02:52.338
Guy tried to climb
in our snow-cone machine

02:52.380 --> 02:53.256
and make an angel.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.120
Is Wes still there?

02:55.170 --> 02:57.343
Nah, he left...
his jacket.

02:57.390 --> 02:58.380
Behind the bar.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.341
Okay, well,
if you talk to him,

03:00.390 --> 03:02.210
will you just
tell him to --

03:03.830 --> 03:04.479
You know what?
Never mind.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.931
May as well finish
what we started.

03:24.980 --> 03:26.323
Thanks.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.246
But I think
I've had enough.

03:28.290 --> 03:31.203
I should go home.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.719
Talk to her about
what happened tonight.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.383
Thanks for listening.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.828
I know our kiss

03:43.870 --> 03:46.305
may have happened
for the wrong reasons, but...

03:46.350 --> 03:50.264
just for the record,

03:50.310 --> 03:52.176
I'm not sorry it did.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.849
Ida: Hello?
Oh.

04:01.890 --> 04:03.107
Hi.

04:03.150 --> 04:05.323
Oh, you're back
from your trip.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.418
What are you still
doing up?

04:07.460 --> 04:10.327
Giving "The Little Mermaid"
legs.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.463
Frank and Fiona?
Their play tomorrow.

04:13.510 --> 04:14.545
Where are you coming from?

04:14.600 --> 04:17.466
I was at the opening
at Aiden's bar.

04:17.510 --> 04:19.466
Was there some sort of
after party?

04:19.519 --> 04:20.680
Maybe.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.386
Did you meet somebody
at a bone

04:25.430 --> 04:26.568
That's kinky.

04:26.610 --> 04:27.736
No, I didn't meet
anybody.

04:27.780 --> 04:29.384
Goodnight, honey.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.397
Mom, your lipstick is smudged
up to your nostrils,

04:31.440 --> 04:33.090
and your hair looks...

04:33.140 --> 04:34.744
very surprised.

04:34.790 --> 04:35.916
Who did you meet?

04:35.970 --> 04:37.176
I met nobody.

04:37.230 --> 04:38.834
I spent the evening
with your father.

04:38.880 --> 04:39.540
Doing what?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.400
Changing his fuse box?

04:41.450 --> 04:42.190
Goodnight.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.836
Mom, did you and Dad --

04:47.500 --> 04:49.889
What's going on?

04:49.940 --> 04:51.840
My mother
slept with my father.

04:53.510 --> 04:54.989
I mean,
you are so grounded.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.906
Where have you been?

05:04.950 --> 05:06.031
I texted you.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.809
I -- I left you, like,
three messages.

05:07.870 --> 05:09.952
I had my ringer off.

05:11.130 --> 05:11.824
Why?

05:11.870 --> 05:13.474
I took a long walk.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.828
I needed to clear my mind,
sort things out.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.826
What things?

05:22.010 --> 05:23.705
I have to tell you something.We
should talk about what happened.

05:23.750 --> 05:24.706
Sorry. Go first.

05:24.750 --> 05:25.967
No, no. You.

05:29.020 --> 05:31.148
Dr. Grant
kissed me tonight.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.065
I know.

05:32.110 --> 05:33.623
I saw.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.809
Well,
it's not what you think --

05:36.850 --> 05:38.375
It freaked me out
as much as you.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.377
And I made it very clear
that --

05:40.420 --> 05:41.979
Don't answer that.What's up, Aiden?

05:42.030 --> 05:43.373
Aiden: Wes! Bro.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.559
It's raining in our bar!

05:46.600 --> 05:49.729
I think our toilet
couldn't handle 300 flushes.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.555
I called a 24-hour plumber.

05:51.610 --> 05:52.088
I'll be right there.

05:54.090 --> 05:55.603
And now it's hailing.

05:55.650 --> 05:58.039
What? Wait.
Where are you going?

05:58.090 --> 05:59.000
We'll talk about this
in the morning. Wes...

05:59.050 --> 06:02.395
Once disaster at a time,
Stella.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.145
Don't worry about a thing

06:08.190 --> 06:12.445
You'll learn to live again

06:12.500 --> 06:14.628
You're gonna learn
to live again

06:14.670 --> 06:17.628
Oh, oh, oh

06:21.460 --> 06:22.541
What'd he say?

06:22.590 --> 06:24.467
Half the building
needs new piping.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.409
The half we're in.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.689
What's all that?

06:27.730 --> 06:31.030
Oh, inspection, insurance,
and a repair estimate.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.424
Where did you find
this inspector?

06:33.480 --> 06:35.289
He advertised
on a bench.

06:35.350 --> 06:38.957
You hired someone
from a sign on a bench?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.172
No sign.

06:40.220 --> 06:42.302
He was just sitting there
on the bench.

06:42.350 --> 06:43.875
H--

06:43.920 --> 06:46.434
_ What?
I tried to save us money.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.527
We're gonna need some fast cash
for repairs?

06:48.580 --> 06:50.309
Mm. Possibly.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.795
Is Pippa still in town?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.309
I need to call
our insurance agent.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.371
Stella: While I was waiting for
Wes to come back from the bar,

07:04.420 --> 07:08.596
Mrs. Gossett asked me
to come to the hospital.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.948
Then she led me
into the elevator

07:09.990 --> 07:12.596
and pressed "Dungeon."

07:12.640 --> 07:14.199
Where exactly
are you taking me?

07:14.250 --> 07:15.513
You'll see.

07:18.650 --> 07:20.960
Do they let volunteers
down here?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.048
Not if they're
still breathing.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.524
We just passed
the morgue.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.605
And that explains
the smell.

07:25.660 --> 07:27.310
Congratulations.

07:27.350 --> 07:28.658
Your event was inspired.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.304
And that's why you're
getting your own office

07:30.360 --> 07:31.612
to plan the next one.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.058
And the one after that.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.352
Really?

07:33.400 --> 07:36.836
There's no title
or salary.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.313
But...there's a door.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.459
And a desk.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.491
Bring a candle.

07:50.810 --> 07:52.505
You sure
you don't want...?

07:52.550 --> 07:54.109
Go ahead.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.595
I think you need it
more than I do.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.209
It must have been
some party.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.466
Sorry I missed it.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.295
Ah, you didn't miss much.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.387
Looks like
you're still recovering.

08:03.430 --> 08:04.215
It must have been
a good time.

08:04.260 --> 08:06.570
What are we talking about?

08:08.700 --> 08:09.826
You're even cute
when you're hungover.

08:11.310 --> 08:13.654
Well, I'm not missing
any more events.

08:13.710 --> 08:14.450
I'm leaving
the meeting early

08:14.490 --> 08:15.264
so I can get to the play.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.448
No, Gina, don't.

08:17.490 --> 08:19.447
I want to. There
will be other plays.

08:19.490 --> 08:21.447
Holiday concerts...

08:21.500 --> 08:23.662
I think I know
what's going on here.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.529
You do?
Mm-hmm.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.581
You're worried
that it's too soon

08:27.630 --> 08:29.678
to drag me
into the Abbott "chaos."

08:29.720 --> 08:32.542
But I know that family's
important to you.

08:32.590 --> 08:35.150
And I want to be
important to you.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.727
Uh-huh. See you soon.

08:42.909 --> 08:43.808
Well, the crab's mother
just bailed.

08:43.870 --> 08:46.259
You're on makeup duty.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.564
That is not gonna
go well, Relax.

08:48.610 --> 08:50.089
Just make
an assembly line.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.996
Slap eye shadow and lip gloss
on 30 kids.

08:52.050 --> 08:54.007
Maybe not the king.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.438
We need to get going.

08:55.490 --> 08:56.309
I have to take
the whole morning off?

08:57.710 --> 08:59.189
Gina will understand.

08:59.230 --> 09:00.265
She's probably coming,
too.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.924
I hope not.

09:01.970 --> 09:04.758
Lizzie, your father
is dating my boss.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.279
And he cheated on her last night
with your mother.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.584
I mean,
if this thing ends up messy,

09:08.630 --> 09:10.359
who do you think
is gonna pay for it?

09:10.410 --> 09:11.673
Why even go there?

09:11.720 --> 09:12.710
This is all my fault.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.841
I should not
have asked your dad

09:13.900 --> 09:14.719
to help your mom
go back to college.

09:14.770 --> 09:15.805
What, so yesterday,

09:15.850 --> 09:16.988
you were willing
to be on Team Mom,

09:17.030 --> 09:18.338
but today you're not?

09:18.380 --> 09:20.633
Well, yesterday,
they were getting a divorce.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.636
And tomorrow,
they probably will.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.294
I mean, haven't you ever
heard of goodbye sex?

09:26.650 --> 09:28.812
Oof.

09:28.870 --> 09:30.599
Everybody
out of the kitchen.

09:30.650 --> 09:31.993
I have limited prep time.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.658
Wh-- I thought
you were making cupcakes.I am.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.599
But carrot-ginger

09:36.660 --> 09:38.913
is a little bit
labor-intensive.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.177
Mom, they're 6.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.834
Just stick with
chocolate and vanilla.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.052
Besides, the only person

09:43.100 --> 09:44.613
who likes carrot-ginger
cupcakes is Dad.

09:45.970 --> 09:46.960
Huh.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.499
You're right.

09:50.850 --> 09:51.715
Mm.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.621
Knock knock.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.637
Dad.
What are you doing here?

09:58.680 --> 09:59.897
I dropped off Gina
for a meeting upstairs.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.328
When I looked for you,

10:01.380 --> 10:03.633
they said
you had a new office.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.819
This is very, very lovely.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.726
I brought you a gift.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.737
Do you have room
for an extra

10:10.780 --> 10:11.815
Sure.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.031
I moved my purse
into the hallway.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.258
- There's
an interesting smell.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.607
I'm getting a candle.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.786
But, please. Sit down.

10:19.830 --> 10:22.561
If you can.
Yeah...

10:22.620 --> 10:23.872
What, uh --

10:23.920 --> 10:25.877
What do they have you
doing down here?

10:25.920 --> 10:28.571
Community Outreach

10:28.620 --> 10:30.054
sorry.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.795
I didn't know you had a --

10:31.840 --> 10:33.319
N-No, that's okay.

10:33.370 --> 10:36.146
Dr. Grant, you remember
my father, Peter.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.713
I'd stand, but I can't.

10:37.760 --> 10:41.458
It's nice
to see you again.Mm.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.500
It's nothing urgent.
I just, um...

10:44.550 --> 10:46.336
You know what?
I'll find you later.

10:46.380 --> 10:47.632
Sure.

10:47.690 --> 10:51.240
I will be here in my
little closet that could.

10:56.910 --> 10:58.344
Bye.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.877
Peter: Stell.
Come on.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.228
Stell.

11:07.270 --> 11:10.877
Can I ask what's going on
between you and that

11:10.930 --> 11:12.830
doctor-who-nothing-should-be-
going

11:15.020 --> 11:16.795
It's kind of a mess.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.751
Honey, you can talk to me.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.804
I'm not here to judge.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.898
He kissed me last night.

11:24.940 --> 11:25.975
Dad, don't -- I --

11:26.030 --> 11:28.465
I stopped it. I did.

11:28.510 --> 11:30.763
Honey, you better
figure this out.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.948
And forget about
this doctor

11:32.990 --> 11:35.300
before he causes
permanent damage.

11:35.340 --> 11:36.387
Dad.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.556
You're not a kid anymore,
Stella.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.863
“You made
a commitment to someone,

11:38.910 --> 11:40.560
and you need to honor it.

11:40.610 --> 11:42.567
Wow.

11:42.610 --> 11:44.738
So much for
"I'll always be there for you,

11:44.790 --> 11:45.951
and I'll never judge you."

11:46.000 --> 11:47.877
I've been in Wes' shoes,
and it's awful --

11:47.920 --> 11:50.480
Being humiliated,
feeling betrayed,

11:50.530 --> 11:51.133
thinking you're
in a relationship

11:51.180 --> 11:52.523
when you're not --

11:52.580 --> 11:54.059
Okay, I-I'm sorry that
I shared that story with you.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.057
You got to tread
a little more carefully

11:56.100 --> 11:58.751
when you're dealing
with people you love.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.017
You sure you want to be
lecturing meabout fidelity

12:06.070 --> 12:08.323
right now?
What?

12:10.070 --> 12:11.856
Mom got home awfully late
last night.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.026
The subject is not me.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.946
You owe it to your husband
to be honest.

12:14.990 --> 12:15.946
I have been,

12:15.990 --> 12:17.207
and that's
more than you can say

12:17.250 --> 12:18.854
about you
and your serious girlfriend.

12:18.910 --> 12:20.071
I'm disappointed in you,
Stell.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.121
You are hardly
the role model for matrimony.

12:22.170 --> 12:23.956
I'm trying to help.Help yourself!

12:24.000 --> 12:25.217
I'm not the one
who can't keep track of

12:25.260 --> 12:26.568
who I'm dating this week.

12:26.610 --> 12:27.953
You're a total hypocrite.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.729
I've got work to do.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.019
There you are.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.539
Uh, they were just directing me
to your new office.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.537
Is it really
next to the morgue?

12:44.580 --> 12:46.537
Maybe.
Why are you looking for me?

12:46.590 --> 12:47.933
I wanted you
to hear from me

12:47.980 --> 12:49.971
that nothing happened
last night.

12:53.330 --> 12:54.115
Apparently,
he hasn't told you yet,

12:54.160 --> 12:56.288
but I'm sure he will.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.728
There's really
not much to tell

12:57.770 --> 12:58.726
because, as I said,

12:58.770 --> 13:00.169
nothing happened
between us...

13:01.600 --> 13:04.206
...beyond
an unexpected kiss.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.697
And it didn't go further
because...?

13:08.740 --> 13:09.901
Because he's married.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.260
But if you're having
any doubts about Wes,

13:13.310 --> 13:15.916
have the courage
to end it.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.395
Let him go.

13:19.660 --> 13:20.832
I don't have any doubts.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.609
Really?

13:22.670 --> 13:24.274
Where were you
on your wedding day?

13:24.320 --> 13:25.833
Hiding.

13:25.890 --> 13:29.360
I showed up to mine,
and I'm still here.

13:29.410 --> 13:30.844
Marriage is work, Pippa.

13:30.890 --> 13:32.540
You wouldn't know that.

13:32.590 --> 13:33.842
Maybe some day you will,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.198
but I promise you,
it is not gonna be with Wes.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.149
I may not know

13:37.200 --> 13:38.929
all the complexities
of marriage,

13:38.990 --> 13:40.151
but I will tell you this --

13:40.210 --> 13:41.860
yours is in trouble.

13:42.730 --> 13:44.687
And the next time
Wes comes to my hotel,

13:44.730 --> 13:46.073
there'll be a key
waiting for him.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.609
Hey.

14:02.660 --> 14:03.616
I heard about
your new job.

14:03.660 --> 14:04.832
Good for you.

14:06.230 --> 14:07.356
You know, by the time
I come back from this trial,

14:07.410 --> 14:08.889
you'll probably be
running this place.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.364
Or running from it.

14:10.410 --> 14:12.185
Give me something I can

14:12.240 --> 14:13.753
Something I can lean on What just happened?

14:13.800 --> 14:14.847
Nothing.

14:14.890 --> 14:16.881
I'm just
really overwhelmed.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.898
About work...or Wes?

14:19.940 --> 14:21.988
Wes mostly,
work a little bit.

14:22.030 --> 14:24.670
Looking down,
looking down again

14:24.730 --> 14:26.073
They put you in charge
of Mental Health?

14:26.120 --> 14:27.508
Really?

14:27.560 --> 14:28.982
They should've
talked to me first.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.077
Looking down

14:31.130 --> 14:33.076
Call Wes.

14:33.130 --> 14:34.780
This,
I can help you with.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.901
Looking down,
looking down again

14:36.960 --> 14:39.918
I need something closer

14:39.960 --> 14:42.088
Someone closer
to confide in

14:42.140 --> 14:44.438
When the time
has been stripped away

14:44.490 --> 14:45.139
What am I supposed to wear
to this thing?

14:45.180 --> 14:47.399
It's a school play.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.407
Didn't you go to school
at some point?

14:49.450 --> 14:50.406
Don't answer that.

14:50.450 --> 14:51.576
Be nice.

14:51.620 --> 14:52.576
My business is sinking.

14:52.630 --> 14:53.756
What did the plumber
recommend?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.143
A snorkel.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.498
What's he doing here?

14:56.540 --> 14:58.588
And what's he chewing on?
Is that the remote?

14:58.630 --> 15:00.496
Winston! Drop it.

15:00.550 --> 15:03.588
I stared from the top

15:03.640 --> 15:05.153
Stared from the top

15:05.200 --> 15:06.599
Looking down,
looking down again

15:06.640 --> 15:08.244
The Nortons left town
for a few days.

15:08.290 --> 15:09.689
I said
I'd entertain him.

15:09.730 --> 15:12.074
I'll see you
in the undertow

15:12.120 --> 15:15.169
Where the time goes on and on
so slow

15:15.210 --> 15:16.257
Hmm.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.426
Oh, Mom called.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.346
We got to get flowers
for the twins.

15:19.390 --> 15:20.346
I wish I cold bring 'em

15:20.390 --> 15:22.563
top-shelf,
water-damaged tequila.

15:22.610 --> 15:23.918
Save those
for family and friends.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.132
I'd save 'em for myself

15:25.180 --> 15:26.659
if I could break my leg
out of jail.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.657
Some dude last night
told me

15:28.710 --> 15:31.054
if you stick
a piece of bologna

15:31.100 --> 15:33.057
between your leg
and the lock,

15:33.100 --> 15:34.147
you can sneak
a cocktail.

15:34.190 --> 15:36.966
The sensor thinks
it's your skin.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.057
Apparently, cold cuts
keep your secrets.

15:39.110 --> 15:42.239
We have enough secrets
for one family.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.975
Why

15:44.030 --> 15:45.498
Why

15:45.550 --> 15:46.938
Nothing.
Okay.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.941
Dad, I screwed up.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.412
I'm trapped.
I called the wrong lifeline.

15:52.470 --> 15:53.983
You're listening as a friend,
right?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.462
What am I listening to?

15:55.510 --> 15:56.727
I called Pippa.

15:56.780 --> 15:57.201
I asked her for a loan
to re-pipe the bar.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.330
I had to.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.381
The stupid inspection
was my fault,

16:00.430 --> 16:02.216
but I wasn't supposed
to get her involved,

16:02.260 --> 16:03.739
but we're desperate.

16:03.780 --> 16:04.952
What are you telling me?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.048
Wes left the bar with Pippa
last night.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.479
See you in the undertow

16:09.530 --> 16:11.225
Stella: You need to call me

16:11.270 --> 16:12.658
or I will come down there,

16:12.710 --> 16:14.314
and we can talk in the bar
under umbrellas

16:14.360 --> 16:16.055
because I am not letting
this whole day go by

16:16.100 --> 16:17.147
without discussing
what happened

16:17.190 --> 16:19.090
between you and Pippa
last night.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.144
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

16:21.190 --> 16:22.919
Oh. Hi.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.233
I'll see you
in the undertow

16:25.280 --> 16:27.009
My timing sucks today,
huh?

16:27.070 --> 16:29.710
Yeah,
it's not a good time.

16:29.770 --> 16:32.546
I just, um...

16:32.600 --> 16:34.728
I-I came by
to congratulate you

16:34.770 --> 16:35.635
on your new job.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.637
It's not really
a job job.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.034
It's just an extension of
what I was already doing --

16:41.080 --> 16:43.208
Promoting
Mental Health Awareness.

16:43.260 --> 16:46.480
Well, if you need
a "before" and "after" guy,

16:46.520 --> 16:47.510
I'm your man.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.041
Look, about last night --

16:50.090 --> 16:51.137
You already apologized.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.217
I didn't come down here
to apologize.

16:53.270 --> 16:55.045
Then why are you here?

16:55.100 --> 16:56.829
Listen, Stella,
one way or another,

16:56.880 --> 16:57.699
we're gonna have to deal
with this.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.095
No, we don't...
have to.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.629
Okay, we are not
discussing this.

17:02.670 --> 17:04.104
I can't.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.276
It has already flipped my life
upside down.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.105
What's going on?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.753
I can't discuss it.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.989
Okay.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.078
I can't do it!
Don't make me!

17:21.119 --> 17:23.202
Sweetie,
you're gonna be great.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.069
I can't remember
what I'm supposed to say.

17:25.130 --> 17:26.905
Well, you were perfect
in the car.

17:26.950 --> 17:27.906
That doesn't count.

17:27.950 --> 17:28.644
It was just you.

17:28.690 --> 17:30.829
Fee, come here.

17:30.870 --> 17:32.213
Put this on.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.046
When you are out there
on stage,

17:34.090 --> 17:35.000
it'll all
come back to you.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.870
You'll know it
when it counts.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.046
McCorkle:
Why am I seeing her feet?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.966
His fishtail
is too short.

17:40.010 --> 17:41.523
Her fishtail is fine,
Miss McCorkle.

17:41.580 --> 17:43.446
There are no phones
in the ocean.

17:43.490 --> 17:47.188
Parents, please,
turn off your phones now.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.277
Sorry. Phone off.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.278
Um, hey,
uh, Gina texted.

17:52.330 --> 17:53.718
She's coming.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.670
So your dad is probably
gonna have to sit

17:54.720 --> 17:55.892
in a different
school district.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.101
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.195
Look,
if Gina runs into them,

17:58.250 --> 18:00.116
<i>Tm gonna be
in a new sales region --</i>

18:00.160 --> 18:01.377
The Yukon.

18:01.420 --> 18:02.637
Why are you shaking?

18:02.690 --> 18:04.556
You're like
a neurotic bowl of Jell-O.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.249
_ No wonder
Fiona's a nervous wreck.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.904
What'd you call me?

18:06.950 --> 18:09.032
Nothing, baby.
You're the best.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.252
Yeah, I did.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.257
I did look
at the disclaimer, Scott,

18:12.300 --> 18:13.950
and it's rubbish.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.695
Well, it's all typed
on the back page.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.344
I had to use a microscope.

18:20.830 --> 18:22.434
Look, I've got someone here.

18:22.490 --> 18:23.264
Let me --
Let me call you back.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.278
Sorry to hear
about the bar.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.708
You okay?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.707
I'm fine --
didn't get much sleep.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.750
I thought I'd swing by

18:31.800 --> 18:32.881
and offer you
a ride to the school.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.273
Oh. Yes. Right.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.718
Uh, okay.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.580
Just -- just --
just give me a second.

18:42.380 --> 18:46.157
So, you filing a claim,

18:46.210 --> 18:47.462
or will you be looking
for more cash?

18:50.300 --> 18:52.257
I'd recommend
steering clear of your ex.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.163
There are too many people
in your relationship, Wes.

18:57.220 --> 19:00.258
Look,
I'm not sure what you --

19:00.310 --> 19:02.176
If you and Stella
are both gonna misbehave

19:02.220 --> 19:04.359
and act out
and test each other,

19:04.400 --> 19:05.879
I'm wW a r N iNng Y O u F 4

19:05.920 --> 19:08.264
this first year of marriage
won't make it to a second.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.799
I didn't
throw the first punch.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.353
Well, don't punch back.

19:11.410 --> 19:12.354
You know
what Stella's been through.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.754
She lost eight years

19:14.800 --> 19:16.313
and is still
trying to catch up.

19:16.370 --> 19:18.190
When you married
my daughter,

19:18.240 --> 19:19.492
we had an agreement
you'd take care of her.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.326
And I have.
Really?

19:21.370 --> 19:23.759
By messing around
with your former girlfriend?

19:23.810 --> 19:24.891
Running off with her

19:24.940 --> 19:26.590
because of something
Stella said or did?

19:26.640 --> 19:27.675
Suddenly having
second thoughts?

19:27.730 --> 19:28.674
You know what?

19:28.730 --> 19:31.336
You're right.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.200
There are too many people
in this relationship.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.438
Give my best to the twins.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.868
I think I should probably
stay here

19:41.910 --> 19:42.866
and deal with the bar.

19:51.530 --> 19:53.089
Are you sure
you're okay?

19:53.140 --> 19:55.404
I'm fine.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.856
Woman: You have one new voice message.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.478
Stella;
Wes, you need to call me,

20:24.520 --> 20:25.692
or I will come down there

20:25.740 --> 20:27.083
and we can talk in the bar
under umbrellas

20:27.130 --> 20:29.087
because I am not letting
this whole day go by

20:29.140 --> 20:30.392
without discussing
what happened

20:30.440 --> 20:32.090
between you and Pippa
last night.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.924
Finally. Where have --

20:41.970 --> 20:43.495
Wes:
Stop. Listen to me.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.621
Your father isn't well.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.672
We're on our way to the E.R.
right now.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.465
Stella?
Can't talk.

20:58.510 --> 20:59.989
My dad's on the way
to the E.R.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.553
That's a friend of mine.
I have to go.

21:07.220 --> 21:08.210
Wes.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.690
What happened?

21:10.740 --> 21:12.048
He collapsed
outside our apartment.

21:12.090 --> 21:13.524
I was at the window
listening to your message --

21:13.570 --> 21:15.083
Is it a heart attack?Are you
the Abbott family?

21:15.140 --> 21:16.301
Yes. Yes. Yes.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.748
He's been stabilized.

21:17.790 --> 21:18.484
The vascular surgeon's
running some tests.

21:18.530 --> 21:19.838
Is it a heart attack?

21:19.880 --> 21:21.314
The doctor will be in shortly
to speak with you.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.316
Ida:
Is it a heart attack?

21:22.360 --> 21:23.486
They don't know yet.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.315
Well, uh,

21:25.370 --> 21:27.099
Yeah. Well, no.

21:27.150 --> 21:28.367
We...

21:28.410 --> 21:30.458
We spoke
before it happened.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.888
Spoke about what?Ida: Oh, geez.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.283
I can't reach
your sister and Diego.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.374
Countdown to curtain,
people!

21:39.420 --> 21:41.377
Two minutes.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.239
You have seven seats
reserved.

21:43.300 --> 21:43.983
My family's coming.

21:44.040 --> 21:44.905
They have one minute,

21:44.950 --> 21:46.338
or I release those seats.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.828
Will he be okay?

21:52.870 --> 21:54.258
Mom,
just let him finish.

21:54.310 --> 21:55.823
When the ascending aorta
tears,

21:55.870 --> 21:58.350
we usually repair this
with a graft

21:58.400 --> 21:59.390
that replaces
the damaged parts.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.523
What about
the aortic arch?

22:02.580 --> 22:04.617
In the future, it is likely
that there could be

22:04.670 --> 22:05.967
complications
with the aortic arch,

22:06.020 --> 22:07.181
necessitating
a second surgery.

22:07.230 --> 22:09.141
But repairing that right now
is riskier --

22:09.190 --> 22:10.533
And I understand that,

22:10.590 --> 22:12.456
but the patient
is relatively young.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.535
If you're trying
to win the battle,

22:13.590 --> 22:14.887
why not try
to win the war?

22:14.940 --> 22:16.897
If the family elects
for the riskier procedure,

22:16.940 --> 22:18.544
that is up to them.

22:18.590 --> 22:20.376
Look, Stella,

22:20.420 --> 22:22.149
your father has a much
better shot in the long run

22:22.210 --> 22:24.076
if this is
his first surgery.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.339
Reoperative procedures
are always more difficult.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.168
Either way,
time is of the essence.

22:29.210 --> 22:31.258
I'll give you a moment
to make a decision.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.473
May I speak to you,
please?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.339
Yes, sir.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.391
Why is he leaving this
up to us?

22:38.440 --> 22:40.215
Uh, while you guys
are deciding,

22:40.270 --> 22:43.433
I could go and get some
hot chocolate or something?

22:43.490 --> 22:44.969
Does anybody want anything?

22:45.010 --> 22:46.523
Aiden, what do you think
we should do?

22:46.580 --> 22:47.661
VWV

22:52.280 --> 22:53.793
Have you made a decision?

22:53.850 --> 22:56.319
Stella: My dad must have
made this kind of call

22:56.370 --> 22:58.065
countless times
when I was sick,

22:58.110 --> 23:00.636
and without him,
my family had no captain.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.897
We'd like you
to win the war.

23:01.940 --> 23:05.160
If you'd like
another moment --

23:05.200 --> 23:06.417
No.

23:06.470 --> 23:07.631
No, my dad's all about
big swings.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.294
So just do the riskier surgery,
please.

23:24.010 --> 23:25.262
Hey.

23:26.490 --> 23:28.299
Hey.

23:30.580 --> 23:32.799
I heard your dad was here.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.535
He's in surgery.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.400
Where's the rest
of your family?

23:36.450 --> 23:39.624
Wes took my mom
and my dad's girlfriend

23:39.670 --> 23:40.330
to the cafeteria,

23:40.370 --> 23:42.930
and Aiden went home

23:42.980 --> 23:45.506
to feed the neighbors' dog
or something.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.369
Feed the dog?

23:46.420 --> 23:47.023
Seriously?

23:47.070 --> 23:48.765
He's freaked out.

23:48.810 --> 23:51.199
He can't handle this.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.945
I thought you told me
he was always there for you.

23:52.990 --> 23:55.209
He was.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.593
But he had time

23:56.650 --> 23:59.347
to wrap his head around
a scary situation.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.478
It's weird.

24:06.530 --> 24:08.487
What?

24:08.530 --> 24:10.134
The Waiting Room.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.615
It's, like,
the only part of the hospital

24:12.660 --> 24:13.138
I've never been in.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.750
Yeah. Me, too.

24:16.970 --> 24:19.667
Hey, Sadie.

24:19.710 --> 24:21.109
I didn't know you were here.
I would've got --

24:21.150 --> 24:22.663
Sadie: God, no.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.233
You think I want
more of this food?

24:29.510 --> 24:31.501
Text me.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.028
Let me know he's okay.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.459
Okay, I will.

24:39.430 --> 24:42.127
You should eat something.

24:42.170 --> 24:43.513
Elizabeth: Stell!

24:57.140 --> 24:59.450
Where do they keep
the damn can opener?

24:59.490 --> 25:00.480
We kept ours here.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.844
And why didn't you tell me
they left instructions?

25:07.890 --> 25:09.585
Okay, first of all,
the can opener's here.

25:09.630 --> 25:11.541
Next time, speak up.

25:11.590 --> 25:12.933
Second of all,
according to this,

25:12.980 --> 25:15.369
you need a pill,

25:15.420 --> 25:17.024
and that requires cheese.

25:22.690 --> 25:25.648
No, I won't give up

25:30.570 --> 25:33.562
But I might give in

25:37.140 --> 25:38.221
Give it up to love

25:38.270 --> 25:40.580
What were you and my dad
talking about

25:40.620 --> 25:41.792
before this happened?

25:41.840 --> 25:44.184
He knew that I was with Pippa
last night.

25:44.230 --> 25:45.573
And T'll never win

25:45.630 --> 25:47.758
Look, I planned
to talk to you about it.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.848
I just -- I didn't expect
the roof of the bar to cave in.

25:49.890 --> 25:51.540
She told me
that she was the one

25:51.590 --> 25:53.581
that stopped it
from being more than a kiss.

25:53.630 --> 25:55.280
It was mutual, Stella.

25:55.330 --> 25:57.719
Okay.

25:57.770 --> 26:01.331
So, you followed her back
to her hotel room to...

26:01.380 --> 26:02.506
What

26:02.560 --> 26:04.335
N-- I could ask you
the same question.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.599
No, you can't. No.

26:06.650 --> 26:09.256
I never initiated anything,
Wes.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.381
Whatever you saw,
you saw it wrong,

26:10.430 --> 26:12.250
and you didn't
stick around long enough

26:12.300 --> 26:13.438
to see me cut it off --

26:13.480 --> 26:15.346
There are enough doctors
in this building

26:15.390 --> 26:16.300
to offer you
friendly advice.

26:16.350 --> 26:17.749
It does not
have to be him.

26:17.790 --> 26:19.269
He is not trying to be
your chum, Stella.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.620
Neither is Pippa.

26:21.660 --> 26:22.650
Do you seriously think

26:22.710 --> 26:24.189
that she wants
to bankroll your bar

26:24.230 --> 26:25.834
because
she's a guardian angel?

26:25.880 --> 26:28.019
No, she made
a special trip down here

26:28.060 --> 26:30.620
to drop a bomb
and blow us up!

26:30.670 --> 26:32.889
You need
to be cold blooded

26:32.930 --> 26:37.151
Need to be cold blooded

26:37.200 --> 26:42.070
These deep waters

26:42.120 --> 26:43.246
What?

26:43.290 --> 26:44.985
I'm dealing with
some pretty big stuff.

26:45.030 --> 26:45.724
What are you dealing with?

26:45.770 --> 26:48.819
"Separation anxiety"?

26:48.860 --> 26:51.648
Yeah, I'll tell you about
separation anxiety.

26:51.690 --> 26:54.341
Try losing your dad
when he's finally your friend.

26:56.390 --> 26:59.917
You can tell me
with your touch

26:59.960 --> 27:03.305
Where we're at now,
I'm out of place

27:03.360 --> 27:05.488
Stuck in the middle

27:05.530 --> 27:08.704
Blinded by my own disgrace

27:08.750 --> 27:12.141
At the risk of losing you

27:12.190 --> 27:14.887
Stop!

27:14.930 --> 27:16.716
Heel! L-Leave me alone!

27:16.760 --> 27:18.580
Sit! Stop!

27:18.630 --> 27:20.678
Never stop
pushing through

27:20.720 --> 27:23.894
These deep waters

27:23.940 --> 27:27.160
Need to be cold blooded

27:27.210 --> 27:31.499
Need to be cold blooded

27:31.560 --> 27:34.166
In these deep waters

27:34.210 --> 27:36.679
Hey

27:36.740 --> 27:40.472
At the risk of losing you

27:40.520 --> 27:43.865
I keep doing what I do

27:43.920 --> 27:48.300
Never stop
pushing through

27:48.360 --> 27:50.783
These deep waters

27:50.840 --> 27:54.663
You need to be
cold blooded

27:54.710 --> 27:58.499
You need to be
cold blooded

27:58.540 --> 28:01.589
It's strange what you see
in rooms like this.

28:01.630 --> 28:03.587
I never thought
you could feel more powerless

28:03.630 --> 28:05.678
than being the one
in the hospital gown.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.724
But you can.

28:08.770 --> 28:09.987
It might be even worse,

28:10.030 --> 28:11.373
because on
this side of the wall,

28:11.420 --> 28:13.070
no one tries
to take away your pain.

28:19.340 --> 28:21.160
She's in the restroom.

28:23.090 --> 28:25.866
I'm assuming
that's for Stella.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.787
No, this is mine,
actually.

28:28.830 --> 28:29.911
I'll, um...

28:29.960 --> 28:31.871
I'll check back
when she's available.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.479
Maybe you didn't hear her
last night,

28:33.530 --> 28:37.444
but she's not...
available.

28:39.540 --> 28:40.701
She's also not happy.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.977
Tell me, if I broke your face
right now,

28:42.020 --> 28:43.624
could you stitch it
yourself?

28:44.890 --> 28:46.494
What's going on?

28:47.420 --> 28:49.024
Are you kidding me?
Really?

28:49.070 --> 28:50.765
The last words
that I said to my dad

28:50.810 --> 28:52.630
were ugly and cruel,

28:52.680 --> 28:54.466
and I may not get the chance
to say another word to him.

28:54.510 --> 28:55.284
We're not doing this
right now.

29:00.690 --> 29:02.385
Your father's recovering.

29:02.430 --> 29:05.218
The procedure went well.

29:05.260 --> 29:07.479
I'll tell
the rest of the family.

29:12.090 --> 29:13.785
Thank you.

29:13.830 --> 29:14.877
Yeah.

29:24.580 --> 29:27.106
He looks peaceful.He looks dead.

29:27.150 --> 29:29.016
Can we wake him up?No, sweetie.
Grandpa needs to rest.

29:29.070 --> 29:31.027
How long
does he have to be here?

29:31.070 --> 29:32.026
They usually
tell you to wait

29:32.070 --> 29:33.549
until the anesthesia
wears off.

29:33.590 --> 29:34.853
It's real hard to find
the elevator buttons.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.028
And the gown's
a little breezy.

29:37.070 --> 29:38.549
God,
I hope he forgives me.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.943
Elizabeth:
Forgives you for what?

29:39.990 --> 29:42.038
Training for that 5K,

29:42.080 --> 29:43.559
pulling him out of bed
at dawn

29:43.600 --> 29:45.125
and making him
run like a jackal.

29:45.170 --> 29:47.389
This didn't happen
because of you. It did.

29:47.430 --> 29:49.250
I should've been taking
better care of him.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.825
Don't blame yourself
for this.

29:50.870 --> 29:53.919
It's me, all me.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.439
He must've been
so torn up inside

29:55.480 --> 29:57.790
after what happened
last night.

29:57.830 --> 29:58.831
What happened last night?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.439
Mom and Dad had a --

30:00.490 --> 30:01.309
Had a what?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.279
W-W-Whoa. Whoa!

30:04.320 --> 30:06.186
You're telling me that
the one slow dance led to --

30:06.230 --> 30:08.187
Two. It was two.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.924
And, yes, Gina,

30:09.980 --> 30:11.709
I slept with my husband
last night.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.273
Okay,
can we change the subject?

30:13.330 --> 30:14.934
This went from "PG"
to a hard "R" real fast.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.028
It happened
after we decided

30:17.070 --> 30:18.458
not to sign
the divorce papers.

30:18.510 --> 30:21.286
But it is no reflection
on how he feels about you.

30:21.340 --> 30:22.375
Really?

30:22.420 --> 30:23.683
He felt horrible
about it afterwards.

30:23.730 --> 30:25.243
We both did.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.166
Lizzie, can you stop her,
please?I mean, it's --

30:27.210 --> 30:28.598
Okay,
I really don't think

30:28.650 --> 30:29.606
we should be
doing this here --

30:29.650 --> 30:31.425
Why am I the only person

30:31.480 --> 30:32.868
that didn't know
about this reunion?

30:32.910 --> 30:34.514
I didn't know.Honestly?

30:34.570 --> 30:37.084
Because you're the only person
here who's not family,

30:37.130 --> 30:39.178
and you're being a little
insensitive to my mother.

30:39.220 --> 30:41.177
Oh, I'm "insensitive"?Lizzie, Lizzie --
I think --

30:41.230 --> 30:42.527
I think you need a filter, all right?I
just found out the man I'm dating

30:42.570 --> 30:44.265
is still
bonking his wife.Bonking?

30:44.320 --> 30:45.708
You know, you don't have
to speak for me, Lizzie.Guys --

30:45.750 --> 30:46.922
Is Dad sleeping
with both of them?Apparently.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.098
And lecturing the rest of us
on fidelity.

30:49.150 --> 30:50.879
Stop.Diego:
Gina, it was one time.

30:50.930 --> 30:52.716
Really?Maybe they just wanted
to end on a high note.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.274
Please, stop!
He can hear you.

30:55.330 --> 30:57.753
He can.

30:57.810 --> 30:59.323
I did for a lot of it,

30:59.370 --> 31:01.589
and I know that this is not
how you want Dad to wake up,

31:01.640 --> 31:03.062
so please just stop.

31:03.120 --> 31:06.988
Drifting away,
we're apart

31:07.030 --> 31:10.421
Can't feel the rain
that floods our hearts

31:10.470 --> 31:13.599
<i>"I knew then that I had made
a terrible choice.</i>

31:13.650 --> 31:15.425
We barely remember love No one could hear me

31:15.480 --> 31:17.039
because I had traded
my voice for legs."Aiden: What is she doing?

31:17.740 --> 31:19.515
What she didn't get to do
at school.

31:19.570 --> 31:23.438
We barely remember us Fiona: "This was the price
I had to pay."

31:23.490 --> 31:24.616
The witch took my tongue,

31:24.660 --> 31:25.912
so I had to speak
with my eyes."

31:25.970 --> 31:28.007
"Weeks, months,
seasons pass along.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.744
How I do I win this war
alone?

31:29.800 --> 31:31.313
They seem little more

31:31.360 --> 31:33.317
than a summer day
and a winter evening.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.976
Now, the Common
where I walk with Dora

31:35.020 --> 31:38.843
is all in bloom,
a field of bright gold."

31:38.890 --> 31:41.757
It's like I'm fighting
with a ghost

31:41.810 --> 31:46.509
We're two battleships
that always miss

31:46.550 --> 31:48.769
But we can't admit

31:48.810 --> 31:54.112
This is
the fear of letting go

31:56.040 --> 31:59.089
"And now the unseen heather
lies in mounds and bunches

31:59.130 --> 32:01.349
underneath
a covering of snow.

32:01.390 --> 32:02.869
Fire in the water,
cover your eyes

32:02.920 --> 32:04.126
In a breath,

32:04.180 --> 32:05.955
the river that flows
through our Sunday walks

32:06.010 --> 32:08.138
is sparkling
in the summer sun."

32:08.180 --> 32:11.047
Can't hear each other

32:11.100 --> 32:14.138
When the ocean cries

32:14.190 --> 32:19.367
We barely remember love

32:20.720 --> 32:25.362
Oh, we barely remember us

32:28.380 --> 32:35.070
How do I win this war
alone?

32:35.120 --> 32:40.900
It's like I'm fighting
with a ghost

32:40.950 --> 32:46.389
We're two battleships
that always miss

32:46.440 --> 32:48.477
And we can't admit

32:48.530 --> 32:52.046
This is
the fear of letting go

32:56.450 --> 32:58.225
You never knew
when it would be the last time,

32:58.280 --> 33:01.056
did you?

33:01.100 --> 33:06.493
E-Even if you were angry
or frustrated at me

33:06.540 --> 33:10.545
or the doctors, the nurses,
the universe...

33:13.860 --> 33:14.986
...you never said
anything to me

33:15.030 --> 33:20.901
that you couldn't
take back.

33:20.950 --> 33:27.640
Because you didn't know
if goodbye was really goodbye.

33:28.610 --> 33:31.216
We barely remember love

33:31.270 --> 33:33.659
And I never thanked you
for that.

33:33.700 --> 33:39.002
Oh, we barely
remember us

33:39.060 --> 33:41.222
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

33:41.280 --> 33:47.970
This is
the fear of letting go

33:48.020 --> 33:51.365
This is
the fear of letting go

34:09.690 --> 34:12.216
Hey, don't sweat it.

34:12.260 --> 34:13.568
I told Frankie

34:13.610 --> 34:16.398
that it'll be our gift
to the hospital.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.090
Some poor kid
will find Aquaman,

34:18.139 --> 34:20.359
and it's gonna be
his lucky day.Yeah, well,

34:20.400 --> 34:22.129
our son is not gonna
leave here without him, so...

34:23.580 --> 34:24.706
Oh, God.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.092
Where else do you think
he could be?

34:26.150 --> 34:27.139
Baby,
it's been a long day.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.181
Come on, we
should get going. No.

34:29.239 --> 34:31.458
I need to apologize
to Gina.

34:31.500 --> 34:32.103
No.

34:32.150 --> 34:34.061
No, you don't.

34:34.110 --> 34:35.100
Okay, she gets it.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.458
Your --
your family is cracked.

34:39.330 --> 34:40.638
In a good way.

34:41.730 --> 34:43.812
I'm the one
who owes an apology.

34:43.860 --> 34:45.554
To you.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.851
Right, it was --

34:46.909 --> 34:48.469
It was stupid of me
putting my office politics

34:48.520 --> 34:49.554
in front of your folks --

34:49.600 --> 34:52.342
Oh, it wasn't stupid --Lizzie.

34:52.389 --> 34:53.255
I should have been
rooting for them

34:53.300 --> 34:54.779
from the beginning.

34:54.830 --> 34:57.174
It was very selfish of me.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.175
Well...

35:01.220 --> 35:03.359
It was selfish of me
to think

35:03.400 --> 35:05.266
that they should patch it up
at any price.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.266
Gina's feelings matter,
too.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.880
And...

35:09.930 --> 35:12.274
I think she really
loves my dad.

35:15.410 --> 35:16.718
Yeah,
it's really messed up.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.194
Yeah.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.378
I'm sorry.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.376
Me, too.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.429
Hey, baby?

35:30.470 --> 35:32.461
We're being watched.

35:34.210 --> 35:36.167
Damn it, Aiden.

35:51.490 --> 35:52.707
So, this is where
you live now.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.276
How did you find it?

35:55.320 --> 35:57.584
Did the nurses tell you
to follow the stench?

36:04.290 --> 36:07.419
I don't know
if I could've forgiven myself

36:07.460 --> 36:08.859
if your father hadn't
pulled through today.

36:08.900 --> 36:13.770
Wes, you're the one
who rushed him here.

36:13.820 --> 36:14.981
You saved him.

36:21.090 --> 36:22.433
My mom thinks

36:22.480 --> 36:24.471
that she broke my dad's heart
twice this year.

36:26.740 --> 36:31.223
But they've been together
30 years.

36:34.230 --> 36:35.834
We don't have that.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.758
My dad's right.

36:44.810 --> 36:46.414
If we keep doing this
to each other --

36:46.460 --> 36:48.019
I still
want to make this work.

36:48.070 --> 36:48.889
So do I.

36:52.380 --> 36:52.938
But...

36:52.990 --> 36:54.685
But what?

36:54.730 --> 36:58.291
But we keep
running into walls.

37:02.260 --> 37:05.992
And I don't know
which way to turn.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.749
You're no longer
the sick little girl

37:10.790 --> 37:12.394
in your family, Stella.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.397
You stepped up today.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.922
You made
a very difficult decision,

37:17.970 --> 37:22.669
which involved risk
and pain.

37:22.710 --> 37:26.101
You're capable
of handling both.

37:30.550 --> 37:31.506
I should probably
get some work done

37:31.550 --> 37:33.325
before the day's over.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.503
I'll grab a ride
with Lizzie and Diego.

37:41.780 --> 37:42.679
Wes?

37:42.730 --> 37:43.993
I'll --
I'll see you at home?

37:46.300 --> 37:48.382
I'll see you at home.

38:04.060 --> 38:05.141
Aiden: Oh, this is...

38:08.540 --> 38:09.325
Pippa?

38:09.370 --> 38:10.531
Hey.

38:10.590 --> 38:12.456
Did you forget
you asked me to meet you?

38:12.500 --> 38:14.366
Yeah, I did.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.455
I was...

38:15.510 --> 38:17.638
The day's been --

38:17.680 --> 38:18.988
I get it.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.543
It sounds as if

38:20.600 --> 38:21.249
you might have to shutter
the place for a bit

38:21.290 --> 38:22.337
to make repairs.

38:22.380 --> 38:25.816
I have a check for you.

38:25.860 --> 38:28.249
I shouldn't have
called you.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.381
I-I'm sorry.

38:29.430 --> 38:32.479
This is business,
Aiden.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.568
Look, you and Wes
need a safety net.

38:34.610 --> 38:35.566
You can Ltjse the funds
0 -

38:35.610 --> 38:36.566
We can't.

38:36.610 --> 38:38.829
We still
can't take your money.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.999
Have you found
another source of capital?

38:43.050 --> 38:46.441
Nope. But I...

38:46.490 --> 38:49.539
I don't care if I got to rob
a bank or sell an organ.

38:49.580 --> 38:50.888
We'll find it.

38:50.930 --> 38:54.537
This bar
means a lot to me.

38:54.590 --> 38:57.366
Well, finding another investor
might be challenging.

38:57.420 --> 38:58.546
Bars are risky ventures.

38:58.590 --> 39:00.456
So are marriages,

39:00.510 --> 39:02.160
and if I have to choose
between this place

39:02.200 --> 39:04.339
and my little sister's
happiness,

39:04.380 --> 39:06.986
I am gonna choose her
every time.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.726
For the pictures,
you're smilin'

39:10.780 --> 39:14.159
Ghost on the edge
of the earth

39:14.220 --> 39:17.474
Fell right over,
you saw in

39:17.520 --> 39:20.524
Flash when you're born

39:20.570 --> 39:21.878
Glowin' all over,
instant shadow Hey.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.524
Oh.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.789
Only a fool I didn't realize...

39:25.840 --> 39:27.797
Could paint
your heart I'll just leave this.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.490
No, wait. Stay.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.536
Real people are different He'll want to see you
when he wakes up.

39:34.580 --> 39:38.323
Nothing stands in their way

39:38.370 --> 39:40.805
Don't worry about
the distance

39:40.850 --> 39:44.457
Time put in my head

39:44.510 --> 39:47.332
Real people are different

39:47.380 --> 39:50.077
Untake my hand

39:50.120 --> 39:53.203
Don't worry about me

39:54.560 --> 39:56.688
Stella!

39:56.740 --> 39:57.957
Hey.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.126
Stella: Hi.

39:59.170 --> 40:02.049
I thought your shift
ended hours ago.

40:02.090 --> 40:03.307
Uh, it did, yeah.

40:03.350 --> 40:04.215
I-I got called
into a meeting.

40:04.270 --> 40:06.045
How's your dad?

40:06.090 --> 40:07.433
Still out of it,

40:07.490 --> 40:10.050
but that could be
his choice --

40:10.100 --> 40:12.614
anything to avoid
taking family sides.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.888
We kind of had a cage match
over his bed.

40:15.930 --> 40:18.490
Mm. That's one way to promote
Mental Health Week.

40:19.670 --> 40:21.195
Thank you again.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.417
I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:23.460 --> 40:27.579
Um, no,
actually you won't.

40:27.640 --> 40:28.857
Nothing you're worth

40:28.900 --> 40:30.459
Your dad's surgeon
reported me to management,

40:30.510 --> 40:32.501
and the hospital put me on
a temporary suspension.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.460
Wait, what?

40:34.510 --> 40:35.557
Why?

40:35.600 --> 40:36.772
Because you gave
a second opinion?

40:36.820 --> 40:39.517
No, he saw it
as more of a challenge.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.210
Talking about a patient
in front of the family

40:41.260 --> 40:42.989
violates hospital protocol,
SO --

40:43.040 --> 40:44.348
Okay, well, is there
someone that I can call?Stella, Stella, please.

40:44.390 --> 40:45.528
Because y-you should not be
punished for this.

40:45.570 --> 40:47.607
You got to leave it alone.

40:47.660 --> 40:49.617
I mean...

40:49.660 --> 40:53.483
me taking a break from --
from here,

40:53.530 --> 40:55.703
it's not a bad thing.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.089
And, besides, I'm pretty good
at speaking up for myself --

40:59.150 --> 41:01.847
most of the time.

41:01.890 --> 41:04.200
Get along

41:04.240 --> 41:06.584
Get along, sing alone

41:06.630 --> 41:08.678
I

41:08.720 --> 41:10.028
Get along

41:10.070 --> 41:11.765
Get along, sing alone

41:11.810 --> 41:14.677
I

41:14.730 --> 41:15.765
Get along
