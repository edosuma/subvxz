WEBVTT

00:04.379 --> 00:06.298
Will you look at that?

00:06.340 --> 00:09.551
He wants a trampoline

00:06.340 --> 00:09.551
for his birthday.

00:09.593 --> 00:12.304
That's so cute, but

00:09.593 --> 00:12.304
we can't afford that.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.727
He can get that if he

00:16.099 --> 00:18.727
doesn't have a party.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.064
That is perfect.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.359
He'll be so surprised.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.896
This is the best part

01:00.394 --> 01:01.896
of my day--

01:01.937 --> 01:04.105
the 16 minutes between

01:01.937 --> 01:04.105
the horrors of school

01:04.147 --> 01:05.816
and the horrors of home.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.275
Malcolm,

01:05.858 --> 01:07.275
there you are.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.277
You know Ira James,

01:07.317 --> 01:09.277
right?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.989
All-state fullback, state

01:09.319 --> 01:11.989
single season rushing record.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.825
Who am I kidding? He's probably

01:12.031 --> 01:14.825
never even talked to you.

01:15.659 --> 01:16.493
Hi.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.953
Ira's graduating

01:16.535 --> 01:17.953
this year.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.497
He's got interest from six

01:17.995 --> 01:20.497
Division 1-A colleges.

01:20.539 --> 01:21.623
Full rides.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.125
The problem is, each

01:21.665 --> 01:24.125
school wants him to write

01:24.167 --> 01:25.836
a personal essay

01:24.167 --> 01:25.836
on his application.

01:25.878 --> 01:26.837
So...?

01:26.879 --> 01:27.922
So Ira's an idiot.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.924
I mean, hamster idiot.

01:29.965 --> 01:33.176
And that's only if we're talking

01:29.965 --> 01:33.176
about a really stupid hamster.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.136
Mom says I have

01:33.218 --> 01:35.136
other nice qualities.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.347
Since you're the smartest

01:35.178 --> 01:37.347
kid in the school,

01:37.389 --> 01:39.016
I want you to help

01:37.389 --> 01:39.016
him write his essays.

01:39.058 --> 01:42.310
I wish I could, but I've got,

01:39.058 --> 01:42.310
like, three midterms next week.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.145
Look, you don't

01:42.352 --> 01:44.145
understand.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.606
Ira is a football

01:44.187 --> 01:45.606
player.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.315
That means when he

01:45.647 --> 01:47.315
needs something,

01:47.357 --> 01:50.151
it's up to you non-football

01:47.357 --> 01:50.151
kids to do it for him.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.237
The cheerleaders

01:50.193 --> 01:52.237
understand it.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.155
Look, I'll make it

01:52.279 --> 01:54.155
worth your while.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.324
I'll let you out of gym

01:54.197 --> 01:56.324
for the rest of the semester.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.325
I don't mind gym.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.662
Sure you don't,

01:57.367 --> 02:00.662
brainiac.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.459
HAL:

02:03.791 --> 02:05.459
Hi, honey.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.212
I'm going

02:07.419 --> 02:09.212
to need you to be calm.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.173
Aw, geez.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.173
Which kid is it?

02:12.215 --> 02:13.174
I'm not going to tell you.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.551
You're not calm enough yet.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.761
Reese.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.639
Okay, deep breath.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.557
What'd he do?

02:20.599 --> 02:22.559
All right.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.352
Reese...

02:24.394 --> 02:26.814
That... glubber...!

02:28.398 --> 02:29.190
That... sniggit...!

02:29.232 --> 02:30.400
I'm gonna...

02:30.442 --> 02:32.360
(speaking gibberish)

02:32.402 --> 02:34.195
Honey, do you want

02:32.402 --> 02:34.195
some tea or a drink?

02:34.237 --> 02:36.197
What's wrong with Dad?

02:34.237 --> 02:36.197
Your father just

02:36.239 --> 02:37.198
found out what Reese did.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.868
What'd he do?

02:37.240 --> 02:39.868
Your brother...

02:39.910 --> 02:41.411
Oh, my God!

02:41.453 --> 02:42.997
Did they have to evacuate?!

02:43.038 --> 02:43.831
Glurb...

02:43.872 --> 02:45.206
Oh, man, what a day.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.875
Vic lost his other one

02:45.248 --> 02:46.875
in the meat grinder,

02:46.917 --> 02:49.628
and the health department

02:46.917 --> 02:49.628
shut us down for 15 minutes.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.212
We were playing

02:49.670 --> 02:51.212
catch up all afternoon.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.213
You sit down.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.216
(speaking gibberish)

02:55.258 --> 02:56.635
He wants to know

02:56.677 --> 02:58.804
how you could do

02:56.677 --> 02:58.804
something so horrible.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.722
(speaking gibberish)

03:00.764 --> 03:02.390
And think you could

03:00.764 --> 03:02.390
get away with it?

03:02.432 --> 03:05.727
(speaking gibberish)

03:05.769 --> 03:07.813
Was that "scramble"

03:05.769 --> 03:07.813
or "strangle"?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.064
What are you guys

03:07.855 --> 03:09.064
talking about?

03:09.106 --> 03:11.441
You know very well

03:09.106 --> 03:11.441
what we're talking about.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.610
Last week, you...

03:13.652 --> 03:15.236
I can name

03:13.652 --> 03:15.236
Third World countries

03:15.278 --> 03:17.322
where stuff like that

03:15.278 --> 03:17.322
happens all the time.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.741
What am I going

03:17.364 --> 03:19.741
to do with you, Reese?

03:19.783 --> 03:21.326
I don't want to tell you

03:19.783 --> 03:21.326
this is a new low,

03:21.368 --> 03:23.162
because every time I do,

03:23.202 --> 03:25.246
you take it

03:23.202 --> 03:25.246
as a personal challenge!

03:25.288 --> 03:26.247
You know what?

03:26.289 --> 03:28.333
I've just worked

03:26.289 --> 03:28.333
my butt off for six hours,

03:28.375 --> 03:29.835
and I don't appreciate

03:28.375 --> 03:29.835
getting yelled at

03:29.877 --> 03:31.252
the second

03:29.877 --> 03:31.252
I come through the door.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.254
You're complaining?

03:33.296 --> 03:35.883
No... complain!

03:35.924 --> 03:37.634
Yell... us!

03:37.676 --> 03:39.427
Hal, give yourself

03:37.676 --> 03:39.427
another minute.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.388
Or you both

03:39.469 --> 03:41.388
could just shut up.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.850
Oh, boy.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.852
In this family, that's

03:44.892 --> 03:46.852
what we call "the closer."

03:46.894 --> 03:48.520
We now know that

03:46.894 --> 03:48.520
Reese is definitely

03:48.562 --> 03:50.189
not living here for

03:48.562 --> 03:50.189
the next few days.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.901
The only question left is

03:50.271 --> 03:53.901
who gets to take the credit.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.446
You're kicked out!

03:57.112 --> 03:58.446
I'm leaving!

03:58.488 --> 04:01.282
Not if we get

03:58.488 --> 04:01.282
to the doorknob first!

04:01.324 --> 04:03.451
You're outta here!

04:01.324 --> 04:03.451
I'm outta here!

04:03.493 --> 04:06.496
Tie goes to the runner.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.084
FRANCIS (over phone):

04:08.623 --> 04:10.084
They kicked Reese out again?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.293
Yeah, we haven't heard

04:10.125 --> 04:12.293
from him in two days.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.294
I'm actually impressed.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.296
Usually by now

04:13.336 --> 04:15.296
he's eating cat food

04:15.338 --> 04:16.381
off of Mrs. Harvey's porch.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.674
This is horrible.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.676
How can they do this

04:17.716 --> 04:19.676
to their own children?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.929
Yeah, it's really

04:19.718 --> 04:21.929
traumatizing me.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.263
Don't they care

04:23.304 --> 04:25.306
about the psychological

04:23.304 --> 04:25.306
damage they're inflicting?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.725
A home isn't conditional.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.517
A home should be

04:27.559 --> 04:29.310
safe and secure and...

04:29.352 --> 04:31.146
Roomy.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.146
What?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.481
The point is,

04:31.188 --> 04:33.481
I got kicked out when I was 15

04:33.523 --> 04:35.025
and I never

04:33.523 --> 04:35.025
got to come home again.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.236
They can't do this to Reese.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.696
Someone has to do something.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.696
Someone has to stop them.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.322
Am I the only one

04:39.738 --> 04:41.322
who understands

04:41.364 --> 04:42.908
what kind of monsters

04:41.364 --> 04:42.908
these people are?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.993
I don't think this

04:42.950 --> 04:44.993
is as big a deal

04:45.035 --> 04:47.788
to the rest of the family

04:45.035 --> 04:47.788
as it is to you.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.497
(sighs)

04:49.539 --> 04:51.332
Maybe you're overreacting.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.333
Overreacting?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.711
Dewey, when you're older,

04:52.375 --> 04:54.711
you will understand.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.922
There are things in life

04:54.753 --> 04:56.922
called priorities,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.925
which I will explain to you

04:56.964 --> 04:59.925
in a few hours when I get there.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.137
Right now, I have to call Otto

04:59.967 --> 05:03.137
and cash in some personal days.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.805
(huffs)

05:04.846 --> 05:06.598
Overreacting.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.019
(knocking)

05:12.687 --> 05:14.606
Great timing. The

05:12.687 --> 05:14.606
muffins just came out.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.191
Thank God you called me.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.153
I can't believe the hell

05:16.233 --> 05:19.153
Mom and Dad put you through.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.156
Hey, whose place

05:19.194 --> 05:22.156
is this?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.448
It's mine.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.033
It's completely furnished,

05:23.490 --> 05:25.033
including cable TV.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.368
I told them I was 18,

05:25.075 --> 05:27.368
so I got a two-year lease.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
You're a banana-

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
walnut man, right?

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
Reese, you can't live

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
in a place like this.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.415
Yeah, I can.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.168
They were having

05:32.457 --> 05:34.168
a move-in special.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.376
First month free.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.419
It's only $375 a month,

05:36.461 --> 05:37.754
utilities included.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.965
I can make my rent in a week

05:37.796 --> 05:39.965
if I pick up an extra shift.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.634
I should have done this,

05:40.007 --> 05:42.634
like, six months ago.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.761
(knocking)

05:42.676 --> 05:44.761
Hey, Reese, come on,

05:42.676 --> 05:44.761
we're going to the roof.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.387
The nursing students

05:44.803 --> 05:46.387
across the street

05:46.429 --> 05:47.430
are taking

05:46.429 --> 05:47.430
their cigarette break.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.640
I'm sorry, I can't.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.391
I'm having my brothers

05:48.682 --> 05:50.391
over for breakfast.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.392
Francis, this is Teddy,

05:51.434 --> 05:52.811
Lou, George.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.897
Divorced, separated,

05:52.853 --> 05:55.897
wife's doing the best friend.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.858
Ex-best friend.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.067
Excuse me.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.402
All right, well,

05:59.109 --> 06:01.402
you know where we'll be.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.030
Hey, is that a wedding ring?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.323
Yeah.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.200
Start hiding

06:04.363 --> 06:06.200
the money now, friend.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.408
Come on, let's go.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.410
Oh, man,

06:07.450 --> 06:09.410
this place is awesome.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.121
Reese, I know you think

06:09.452 --> 06:11.121
this place is great,

06:11.163 --> 06:13.332
but any objective

06:11.163 --> 06:13.332
observer will tell you

06:13.372 --> 06:14.791
it's most certainly not.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.001
Whoa!

06:16.043 --> 06:17.418
This place is awesome!

06:18.170 --> 06:19.004
One thing's for sure.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.298
I'd never, ever leave

06:19.046 --> 06:21.298
if I were you.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.299
So who's up for

06:21.340 --> 06:22.299
some muffins?

06:22.341 --> 06:24.092
I am.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.092
Me.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.092
No! No muffins.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.220
Reese, you can't just keep

06:24.134 --> 06:26.220
playing house like this.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.596
Mom and Dad did something

06:26.261 --> 06:28.596
really horrible to you,

06:28.638 --> 06:30.431
just like they did to me,

06:30.473 --> 06:32.475
only you can't let them

06:30.473 --> 06:32.475
get away with it.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.435
You don't belong here.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.435
You belong at home.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.230
All right, fine.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.814
Tell me one thing

06:36.271 --> 06:37.814
about my life

06:37.856 --> 06:40.859
that would be better

06:37.856 --> 06:40.859
if I was still at home.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.364
I thought the "toilet seat

06:42.485 --> 06:45.364
never needs warming" argument

06:45.404 --> 06:47.366
was pretty good.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.456
Okay, the main thing to remember

06:53.372 --> 06:55.456
is that a college essay

06:55.498 --> 06:57.084
is just like any other

06:55.498 --> 06:57.084
essay you've written.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.337
You know, like homework.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.300
For one of your classes.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.929
Come on, Ira,

07:07.510 --> 07:08.929
I know it seems hard,

07:08.970 --> 07:10.638
but you just

07:08.970 --> 07:10.638
have to get started.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.474
Like, if you had to describe

07:10.680 --> 07:13.474
yourself in one word,

07:13.516 --> 07:15.185
what would that word be?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.401
Ira.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.113
Okay. There we go.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.323
"Ira."

07:28.365 --> 07:29.741
See? We started.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.494
Now, what else?

07:30.742 --> 07:33.494
I don't know.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.580
I'm not much of a

07:33.536 --> 07:35.580
writer or a reader.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.539
I don't like words.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.540
They confuse me.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.500
There's, like, hundreds of them.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.502
Calm down. You can do this.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.503
You know what?

07:42.545 --> 07:43.671
I'm going to say something,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.424
and you just say the first thing

07:43.713 --> 07:45.424
that comes to your head.

07:45.465 --> 07:49.177
My earliest memory in life is...

07:49.219 --> 07:51.388
Blue.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.555
Thing.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.683
Blue thing.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.894
Good, you can use that.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.438
Like, um...

08:00.605 --> 08:01.898
"Sometimes my childhood

08:01.940 --> 08:04.109
"feels vague and distant,

08:04.151 --> 08:08.113
like something draped

08:04.151 --> 08:08.113
in a blue haze."

08:08.155 --> 08:10.115
See?

08:10.157 --> 08:12.575
Yeah. That's cool.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.411
Okay, my biggest fear is...

08:14.453 --> 08:15.536
Spiders.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.956
No-- waffles.

08:19.582 --> 08:24.004
"I let my fears wash over

08:19.582 --> 08:24.004
me and I see that I am

08:24.045 --> 08:26.923
"imprinted with

08:24.045 --> 08:26.923
a repeating pattern

08:26.965 --> 08:29.217
of optimism and despair."

08:29.259 --> 08:31.552
Hey, that's not bad.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.554
"I hope someday

08:33.596 --> 08:34.848
"to free myself,

08:34.889 --> 08:36.557
to find the one thing..."

08:36.599 --> 08:37.851
You're not going

08:36.599 --> 08:37.851
to do anything?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.227
You have to go

08:37.892 --> 08:39.227
to that apartment

08:39.269 --> 08:40.561
and get him back.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.397
Look, that's not how it works.

08:42.439 --> 08:43.564
Oh, I know how it works.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.484
I was thrown

08:43.606 --> 08:45.484
into military school so fast,

08:45.525 --> 08:46.651
I still had shampoo in my hair.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.652
The minute

08:46.693 --> 08:47.652
a child

08:47.694 --> 08:50.364
is inconvenient to you,

08:47.694 --> 08:50.364
you kick him out.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.573
Francis, this is really

08:50.405 --> 08:52.573
none of your business.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.242
You don't even

08:52.615 --> 08:54.242
live here anymore.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.577
Because you kicked me out!

08:56.619 --> 08:58.621
And now you're doing

08:56.619 --> 08:58.621
the same thing to Reese.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.290
Right now he's sitting

08:58.663 --> 09:00.290
in that apartment

09:00.332 --> 09:01.375
with his cable TV

09:01.416 --> 09:03.377
and his huge stack

09:01.416 --> 09:03.377
of video games...

09:03.418 --> 09:04.378
miserable.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.381
If Reese is unhappy,

09:04.419 --> 09:07.381
he brought it on himself.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.631
Really? So what's this?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.591
Like the tenth time he's

09:08.673 --> 09:10.591
"brought it on himself"?

09:10.633 --> 09:11.759
And let's see,

09:11.801 --> 09:13.845
Malcolm's "brought it

09:11.801 --> 09:13.845
on himself" six times,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.596
so with my 28 times,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.596
that makes...

09:15.638 --> 09:16.806
40 kick-outs,

09:16.848 --> 09:19.600
three different kids,

09:16.848 --> 09:19.600
and the only constant

09:19.642 --> 09:21.436
through all of this is you two.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.980
Francis,

09:21.478 --> 09:23.980
that is not fair.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.606
Maybe you just

09:24.022 --> 09:25.606
don't like sharing

09:25.648 --> 09:26.691
your house with your children.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.693
So when's Dewey going

09:26.733 --> 09:28.693
to "bring it on himself"?

09:28.735 --> 09:29.819
When's Jamie?

09:32.447 --> 09:33.490
Where is Jamie?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.617
He's at

09:34.949 --> 09:36.617
the babysitter's.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.786
Just till 5:00.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.499
MAN 1 (crying): Oh, for

09:38.828 --> 09:42.499
the love of God, Carol,

09:42.541 --> 09:43.791
leave me my dignity.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.626
Okay, take my dignity.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.837
Just let me see my kids.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.842
MAN 2:

09:51.674 --> 09:52.842
Just pull the trigger.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.719
In one second,

09:52.884 --> 09:54.719
it'll all be over.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.680
Come on, stop being

09:54.761 --> 09:57.680
such a coward and do it!

09:57.722 --> 09:59.640
Hey, Dave, is that you?

09:59.682 --> 10:01.642
Uh... yeah.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.644
What channel

10:01.684 --> 10:03.644
do you have on in there?

10:03.686 --> 10:06.064
It sounds better

10:03.686 --> 10:06.064
than what I'm watching.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.030
This is all...

10:14.072 --> 10:16.657
new to us.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.578
We've never...

10:19.619 --> 10:21.662
examined our

10:19.619 --> 10:21.662
parenting before.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.457
It always seemed

10:21.704 --> 10:23.457
to us

10:23.498 --> 10:26.667
like something that should

10:23.498 --> 10:26.667
just come naturally.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.044
Yeah, everything

10:26.709 --> 10:28.044
on the planet's

10:28.086 --> 10:29.670
been having kids

10:28.086 --> 10:29.670
for billions of years.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.922
I mean,

10:29.712 --> 10:30.922
look at snakes.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.673
They never take

10:30.964 --> 10:32.673
parenting classes.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.967
The world's

10:32.715 --> 10:33.967
crawling with them.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.303
How exactly did you

10:34.008 --> 10:36.303
want me to help you?

10:36.344 --> 10:41.891
Well, we have fallen

10:36.344 --> 10:41.891
into a bad pattern.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.686
Our boys misbehave

10:41.933 --> 10:45.686
and they are punished.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.687
And then they

10:45.728 --> 10:46.687
severely

10:46.729 --> 10:47.897
misbehave

10:46.729 --> 10:47.897
and they are

10:47.939 --> 10:49.107
severely punished.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.776
And then they misbehave

10:49.149 --> 10:51.776
in some outlandish,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.779
jaw-dropping way where,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.779
if we responded in kind,

10:54.821 --> 10:56.697
we'd end up in jail.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.907
We're at the end

10:56.739 --> 10:57.907
of our rope here.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.367
Well, of course you are.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.953
So, we were hoping

10:59.409 --> 11:01.953
that with all your training,

11:01.995 --> 11:04.581
you could teach us

11:01.995 --> 11:04.581
some kind of subtle trick

11:04.623 --> 11:06.583
that would stop them

11:04.623 --> 11:06.583
in their tracks.

11:06.625 --> 11:07.542
Trick?

11:07.584 --> 11:08.709
Yeah, you know,

11:08.751 --> 11:10.211
some kind of secret

11:08.751 --> 11:10.211
psychological thing

11:10.253 --> 11:13.006
that would get them to shut up

11:10.253 --> 11:13.006
and listen to us for a change.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.549
Yeah, my husband's

11:13.047 --> 11:14.549
getting older.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.717
I mean, he can still

11:14.591 --> 11:16.717
take them individually,

11:16.759 --> 11:18.094
but if they ever

11:16.759 --> 11:18.094
team up on him...

11:18.136 --> 11:20.096
Look, I don't think

11:18.136 --> 11:20.096
it's a good idea

11:20.138 --> 11:23.724
to treat kids like criminals or

11:20.138 --> 11:23.724
animals that need to be broken.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.977
You've never met our boys.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.729
Yeah, you can't begin

11:26.019 --> 11:28.729
to imagine the things they do.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.940
I've been practicing psychiatry

11:28.771 --> 11:30.940
for 40 years.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.818
There's nothing you could say

11:30.982 --> 11:33.818
that would shock me.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.323
All right.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.783
Last week, Reese...

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
Oh, my God!

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
What were the cats for?

11:43.786 --> 11:45.455
We don't know.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.373
Give me a minute.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.543
Now...

11:49.584 --> 11:53.754
even in the most extreme,

11:49.584 --> 11:53.754
breathtakingly horrifying cases,

11:53.796 --> 11:58.134
there are some techniques

11:53.796 --> 11:58.134
that can be useful.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.179
Yes! See, I told you this wasn't

11:58.176 --> 12:01.179
a waste of 90 bucks.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.764
Have you ever heard

12:01.221 --> 12:03.764
of Active Listening?

12:03.806 --> 12:05.141
No.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.769
Most teenagers act out

12:05.183 --> 12:08.769
because they feel no one cares.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.565
With Active Listening,

12:08.811 --> 12:11.565
you mirror back

12:11.606 --> 12:13.191
everything your child says,

12:13.233 --> 12:14.775
which shows you're

12:13.233 --> 12:14.775
hearing them,

12:14.817 --> 12:16.777
and, by extension,

12:14.817 --> 12:16.777
understanding.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.196
I know.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.196
It sounds simple.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.865
But believe me,

12:18.238 --> 12:20.865
I've seen it work miracles.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.369
Yeah, I don't think Reese

12:20.907 --> 12:24.369
would respond to that.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.413
You're worried

12:24.411 --> 12:26.413
it won't help him.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.373
Yes! What if it actually makes

12:26.454 --> 12:28.373
it worse?

12:28.415 --> 12:29.249
I don't think

12:29.290 --> 12:30.041
I could stand

12:30.083 --> 12:32.085
any more trouble

12:30.083 --> 12:32.085
with him.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.087
Oh, this is so confusing!

12:34.128 --> 12:36.047
You're feeling mixed-up

12:34.128 --> 12:36.047
right now.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.798
God, yes, I am.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.798
You know, I'm usually

12:37.840 --> 12:39.426
so sure of myself,

12:39.467 --> 12:40.677
but this whole thing

12:40.719 --> 12:43.430
has just made me question

12:40.719 --> 12:43.430
every aspect of...

12:45.724 --> 12:47.601
Oh, that's good.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.437
Oh, that's really good.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.855
"...I now realize

12:52.897 --> 12:55.816
"that blue is not the

12:52.897 --> 12:55.816
color of confusion,

12:55.858 --> 12:57.485
"but rather,

12:57.527 --> 12:59.237
it is the color of hope."

12:59.279 --> 13:00.196
Yeah.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.531
That's it.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.658
Dude, the parts I understood...

13:01.573 --> 13:03.658
they were awesome.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.868
Great, well, now

13:03.700 --> 13:05.868
that we have the

13:03.700 --> 13:05.868
ideas  all down,

13:05.910 --> 13:08.121
all we have to do is put

13:05.910 --> 13:08.121
it into the kind of words

13:08.162 --> 13:09.830
that you would actually...

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
Thanks, Malcolm.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
You're awesome.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.834
People are going to think

13:11.874 --> 13:13.834
I'm so smart.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.836
Wait! We're not done yet.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.836
Hold on a second...

13:15.878 --> 13:17.672
Blue is definitely

13:15.878 --> 13:17.672
my favorite color now.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.223
Hey! Let's get going, Reese.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.059
It's Ladies-Get-Free-Shrimp

13:27.265 --> 13:30.059
Night at the Red Lobster.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.852
Maybe I'll meet you down there.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.229
I got to get a jump

13:31.894 --> 13:33.229
on my homework.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.272
Hey, you already blew off

13:34.314 --> 13:35.856
Air Hockey Night

13:34.314 --> 13:35.856
and Pot Luck Wednesday,

13:35.898 --> 13:37.442
but I was counting on you

13:35.898 --> 13:37.442
for tonight.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.902
I need someone to turn the

13:37.484 --> 13:39.902
conversation to my tongue trick.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.488
I guess now that I'm on my own,

13:41.529 --> 13:43.782
I just feel

13:41.529 --> 13:43.782
like being more responsible.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.032
Hey, I got three kids.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.451
You don't see me talking

13:45.074 --> 13:46.451
about responsibility.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.328
Come on, I'm not taking

13:46.493 --> 13:48.328
no for an answer.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.163
Okay, okay.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.883
Mom? I have a problem.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.883
I need to talk.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.260
Good.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.930
You can talk, and I will listen.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.059
This football player wants

14:09.932 --> 14:12.059
to use an essay I wrote

14:12.101 --> 14:14.521
for his college application

14:12.101 --> 14:14.521
and pretend it's his own.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.396
I know it's dishonest,

14:15.438 --> 14:17.898
but I might be making

14:15.438 --> 14:17.898
too much of it.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.693
I wanted to get your advice.

14:19.734 --> 14:24.071
You're hoping

14:19.734 --> 14:24.071
I can help you.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.907
Yeah, I just said that.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.117
So, I don't think he should get

14:28.159 --> 14:29.910
into college

14:28.159 --> 14:29.910
under false pretenses,

14:29.952 --> 14:30.911
but are they really

14:29.952 --> 14:30.911
false pretenses

14:30.953 --> 14:33.164
if nobody thinks

14:30.953 --> 14:33.164
he's smart anyway?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.207
I don't want

14:33.206 --> 14:34.207
to be a part

14:34.248 --> 14:35.916
of his cheating,

14:34.248 --> 14:35.916
but I also don't want

14:35.958 --> 14:37.918
to take away his shot

14:35.958 --> 14:37.918
at going to college.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.379
I just don't know what to do.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.717
You're uncertain...

14:43.758 --> 14:46.302
what action to take.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.554
Yes!

14:47.595 --> 14:49.222
Why are you talking

14:47.595 --> 14:49.222
like a robot?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.225
You want to know why I'm...

14:52.266 --> 14:54.602
talking like a robot.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.855
I have a problem,

14:54.644 --> 14:56.855
and I need your help!

14:56.896 --> 15:00.233
All you're doing is mindlessly

14:56.896 --> 15:00.233
parroting back what I say!

15:00.274 --> 15:03.944
You say one thing,

15:00.274 --> 15:03.944
and I restate it.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.739
Forget it! If you're

15:03.986 --> 15:05.739
not going to help me,

15:05.780 --> 15:07.448
you don't have to mock me!

15:08.408 --> 15:10.326
We do not come from

15:08.408 --> 15:10.326
a family of criminals.

15:10.368 --> 15:13.246
You do not let him

15:10.368 --> 15:13.246
turn in that essay!

15:13.287 --> 15:14.664
(sighs)

15:14.706 --> 15:16.666
God, I knew listening

15:14.706 --> 15:16.666
to our kids would be a mistake.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.751
(phone ringing)

15:17.792 --> 15:19.210
Hello?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.336
Hello. Is this the residence

15:20.378 --> 15:21.962
of the most un-nurturing,

15:20.378 --> 15:21.962
callous parents

15:22.004 --> 15:22.963
in the universe?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.340
It's for you.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.717
Hello.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.968
Hi. I just got off the phone

15:25.759 --> 15:27.968
with your son, Reese.

15:28.010 --> 15:28.969
It's been over a week,

15:29.011 --> 15:30.971
and you haven't

15:29.011 --> 15:30.971
even talked to him?

15:31.013 --> 15:32.390
Congratulations!

15:31.013 --> 15:32.390
The fracturing

15:32.432 --> 15:34.642
of this family

15:32.432 --> 15:34.642
is now two-fifths complete.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.478
Francis, this is a very hard

15:34.684 --> 15:37.478
and complicated situation,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.022
and I don't need you

15:37.520 --> 15:40.022
to yell at me right now.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.609
There is nothing complicated

15:40.064 --> 15:42.609
about it.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.069
Just go to his apartment,

15:42.650 --> 15:45.069
tell him you love him

15:45.111 --> 15:46.780
and ask him to come home.

15:46.821 --> 15:47.572
Are you nuts?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.365
This is Reese

15:47.614 --> 15:49.365
we're talking about.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.201
So what?

15:49.407 --> 15:52.201
Come on! You know

15:49.407 --> 15:52.201
exactly how he thinks.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.994
If we show

15:52.243 --> 15:53.994
that kind of weakness,

15:54.036 --> 15:56.497
it's like showing a hyena

15:54.036 --> 15:56.497
the belly of an antelope.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.375
Reese will come home

15:56.539 --> 15:59.375
with no limits

15:56.539 --> 15:59.375
and no boundaries.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.377
Within five years,

15:59.417 --> 16:01.377
we will be saying

16:01.419 --> 16:03.797
our last words to him

16:01.419 --> 16:03.797
over a police bullhorn.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.674
All I know is that you have

16:03.838 --> 16:06.674
a child that needs you.

16:06.716 --> 16:07.759
DEWEY:

16:06.716 --> 16:07.759
No, he doesn't!

16:07.801 --> 16:09.719
He's happy where he is,

16:07.801 --> 16:09.719
and so are we!

16:09.761 --> 16:10.804
Dewey, get off the phone.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.388
(beeps)

16:12.430 --> 16:14.390
Mom, I understand

16:12.430 --> 16:14.390
what you're worried about,

16:14.432 --> 16:16.935
but there is more to Reese

16:14.432 --> 16:16.935
than you give him credit for.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.227
I wish I could believe that.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.688
Honey, I got to go.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.688
There's another call.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.815
What'd he...?

16:21.856 --> 16:23.608
Hello.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.234
Yes, this is she.

16:25.276 --> 16:28.947
This is Peter Noyes,

16:25.276 --> 16:28.947
Reese's chemistry teacher.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.031
I'm sure you remember me

16:28.988 --> 16:31.031
from last year's hearing.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.867
There's something...

16:32.909 --> 16:35.035
new I have to discuss with you.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.664
Oh, my God! What did he do now?

16:37.705 --> 16:39.833
Your son...

16:39.874 --> 16:43.043
He got an "A" on his midterm?!

16:43.085 --> 16:44.295
They matched the handwriting,

16:44.337 --> 16:46.046
they had him reenact

16:44.337 --> 16:46.046
the experiment.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.214
He did it himself.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.759
Mr. Noyes said it's

16:47.256 --> 16:49.759
the most remarkable turnaround

16:49.801 --> 16:51.051
he's ever seen.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.303
Wow!

16:52.345 --> 16:57.517
He also said that we should be

16:52.345 --> 16:57.517
really proud of ourselves.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.271
Hey, Ira.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.064
Listen, do you have

17:02.313 --> 17:04.064
that essay I wrote?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.066
I just wanted to make

17:04.106 --> 17:06.066
one quick change.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.067
Yeah.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.528
Here it is.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.739
The change I want

17:08.569 --> 17:11.739
to make is this.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.659
Was it too long?

17:14.701 --> 17:15.869
No!

17:15.910 --> 17:16.995
Listen to me, Ira.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.454
Everyone gives you breaks.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.540
Everyone does

17:18.496 --> 17:20.540
everything for you.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.667
You might think it's

17:20.581 --> 17:22.667
good, but it's not.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.461
They're telling you you're an

17:22.709 --> 17:25.461
idiot, and you're not an idiot.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.713
You can write this essay.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.255
You can write this

17:26.754 --> 17:28.255
essay on your own.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.257
Remember that story

17:28.297 --> 17:30.257
you told me about

17:30.299 --> 17:31.801
the two-pound steak

17:30.299 --> 17:31.801
you once ate?

17:31.843 --> 17:34.094
You thought it'd be

17:31.843 --> 17:34.094
impossible, but you took it

17:34.136 --> 17:35.555
one bite at a time,

17:34.136 --> 17:35.555
and you did it.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.516
You just need to do the

17:35.596 --> 17:38.516
same thing with your essay.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.267
Okay, I'll try.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.395
"And then I pretended

17:40.309 --> 17:42.395
I was Rocky,

17:42.436 --> 17:44.355
"and I told Mr. T, 'Go for it.'

17:44.397 --> 17:46.315
"I really wished

17:44.397 --> 17:46.315
his Mohawk fell off

17:46.357 --> 17:48.735
"when he got hit.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.610
The end."

17:49.652 --> 17:52.112
Thanks, Malcolm.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.112
This is the most words

17:52.154 --> 17:54.114
I've ever put together

17:52.154 --> 17:54.114
in my life.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.616
Yeah.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.117
I-It shows.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.119
Mmm!

17:59.161 --> 18:00.329
This is amazing.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.707
I think the lemon zest

18:00.371 --> 18:02.707
really brings it to life.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.166
How's your dinner?

18:04.208 --> 18:07.127
DAVE (sobbing): I'm having

18:04.208 --> 18:07.127
half-frozen Lean Cuisine.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.589
Not much of a last meal,

18:07.169 --> 18:09.589
if you ask me!

18:09.630 --> 18:11.173
(knocking)

18:13.801 --> 18:15.053
What are you doing here?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.136
Can we come in?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.764
Sure. You want some dinner?

18:17.805 --> 18:19.139
No, but thank you, Reese.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.017
Seriously. I just got

18:19.181 --> 18:21.017
a convection oven.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.185
I can whip you up a frittata

18:21.059 --> 18:23.185
in, like, ten minutes.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.353
(whispers):

18:23.227 --> 18:24.353
It's spotless.

18:24.395 --> 18:28.148
Reese, we came here

18:24.395 --> 18:28.148
to do something.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.317
It goes against

18:28.190 --> 18:30.317
all of our instincts,

18:30.359 --> 18:33.613
and even as I'm about to do it,

18:30.359 --> 18:33.613
it doesn't feel right.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.032
But... it seems

18:33.654 --> 18:36.032
our instincts aren't

18:36.074 --> 18:38.158
very good lately,

18:36.074 --> 18:38.158
so... here goes.

18:38.200 --> 18:38.952
What is it?

18:38.993 --> 18:40.036
Reese, we love you,

18:40.078 --> 18:43.957
and we think you might be

18:40.078 --> 18:43.957
better off staying here.

18:43.998 --> 18:44.958
Really?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.166
Honest to God,

18:44.999 --> 18:46.166
you seem to be

18:46.208 --> 18:47.251
doing much better

18:46.208 --> 18:47.251
without us.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.461
I mean,

18:47.293 --> 18:48.461
let's face it,

18:48.502 --> 18:50.421
in 17 years with us,

18:48.502 --> 18:50.421
you have spent

18:50.463 --> 18:53.340
more days in juvenile court

18:50.463 --> 18:53.340
than you have in school.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.802
But now, after ten

18:53.382 --> 18:55.802
days on your own, you...

18:55.843 --> 18:58.178
you're a functioning

18:55.843 --> 18:58.178
member of society.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.179
Wow!

18:59.221 --> 19:01.766
I must have

18:59.221 --> 19:01.766
really changed.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.019
I don't even want

19:01.808 --> 19:05.019
to rub it in.

19:05.061 --> 19:05.979
(door opens)

19:06.020 --> 19:07.229
Mail call!

19:07.271 --> 19:08.856
I confiscated your Victoria's

19:07.271 --> 19:08.856
Secret catalog.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.484
A kid your age should...

19:08.898 --> 19:11.484
Oh, you're entertaining.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.902
Teddy, these

19:11.525 --> 19:12.902
are my parents.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.988
Mom, Dad, this is

19:12.944 --> 19:14.988
my neighbor, Teddy.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.363
Hello.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.363
This visitation thing's

19:16.405 --> 19:18.532
a real pain in the ass, huh?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.828
You know, this place

19:19.826 --> 19:21.828
isn't so bad.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.831
Next time we come,

19:21.869 --> 19:24.831
we can bring some plants.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.040
Sweet! Hold on a sec.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.670
Hi, I just got

19:28.835 --> 19:30.670
your Deluxe Platinum Card,

19:30.711 --> 19:32.379
and I want to

19:30.711 --> 19:32.379
activate it.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.048
"Two-four-seven-one."

19:34.090 --> 19:36.592
Now, listen, I already

19:34.090 --> 19:36.592
transferred a $3,000 balance

19:36.634 --> 19:38.218
from the Valley

19:36.634 --> 19:38.218
Federal Card

19:38.260 --> 19:40.013
over to my Spring

19:38.260 --> 19:40.013
Mills Mutual Card,

19:40.054 --> 19:41.430
because I had

19:40.054 --> 19:41.430
an $8,000 limit.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.599
But since I'm already

19:41.472 --> 19:43.599
bumping against that,

19:43.641 --> 19:46.144
I might as well transfer

19:43.641 --> 19:46.144
everything to yours,

19:46.185 --> 19:47.603
because it has

19:46.185 --> 19:47.603
a $20,000 limit.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.814
Sure, I'd love to

19:47.645 --> 19:49.814
talk to a supervisor.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.231
Hey! I was on the phone!

19:51.273 --> 19:52.399
You've been using credit cards?

19:52.441 --> 19:53.818
How much have you spent?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.235
Ten, 11 grand.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.154
But I'm still

19:56.195 --> 19:57.237
way under the $20,000 limit.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.406
How can you spend

19:57.279 --> 19:59.406
that much in ten days?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.617
Well, you know,

19:59.448 --> 20:01.617
I got that new convection oven,

20:01.659 --> 20:04.244
and that made the refrigerator

20:01.659 --> 20:04.244
look kind of shabby.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.039
Plus, I had to buy new clothes

20:06.080 --> 20:07.165
every time mine got dirty.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.415
And that giant gong

20:07.206 --> 20:08.415
in the bathroom?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.292
I mean,

20:08.457 --> 20:10.292
how do you guys do it?

20:10.334 --> 20:13.253
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:13.295 --> 20:14.463
Reese, I really owe

20:13.295 --> 20:14.463
you some thanks

20:14.505 --> 20:16.049
for giving me some

20:14.505 --> 20:16.049
faith in myself.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.843
The next few days, I will

20:16.090 --> 20:18.843
be saying very little.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.928
I will be deciding

20:18.885 --> 20:20.928
on a punishment.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.972
Ideas are already

20:20.970 --> 20:22.972
popping into my mind.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.850
It's really very exciting,

20:23.014 --> 20:25.850
but I don't want to get hasty

20:25.892 --> 20:27.894
and leave either of us

20:25.892 --> 20:27.894
feeling dissatisfied.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.270
Ow! You're going to drag me

20:27.935 --> 20:30.270
all the way home?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.981
Well, we're taking

20:30.312 --> 20:31.981
your ear there.

20:32.023 --> 20:35.068
If the rest of you wants

20:32.023 --> 20:35.068
to come, that's fine, too.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.653
It's been almost a month,

20:35.109 --> 20:37.653
and Mom's still coming up

20:37.695 --> 20:39.279
with fresh punishments

20:37.695 --> 20:39.279
for Reese.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
She says she's never felt

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
more creative.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.201
She must be doing

20:41.323 --> 20:43.201
something right.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.911
He has a white streak

20:43.242 --> 20:44.911
in his hair.

20:44.952 --> 20:45.870
Hey, Malcolm. Guess what.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.496
I got accepted.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.496
I'm going to college.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.956
Really? Which school?

20:48.998 --> 20:51.792
All of them--

20:48.998 --> 20:51.792
A&M, Tulane, Georgia, Stanford.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.294
Full scholarships

20:51.834 --> 20:54.294
and everything.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.214
Stanford liked your essay?

20:56.255 --> 20:59.008
No, I forgot to put it in

20:56.255 --> 20:59.008
the envelope. I got in, anyway.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.010
But don't worry.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.010
That essay didn't go to waste.

21:01.052 --> 21:04.013
I handed it in as

21:01.052 --> 21:04.013
my math midterm and got an "A."

21:04.055 --> 21:06.224
Thanks for making me believe

21:04.055 --> 21:06.224
in myself, Malcolm.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.935
You proved that I don't need

21:06.265 --> 21:08.935
all these people helping me.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.644
See ya.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.814
Stanford. Poor guy.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.691
I'll bet he doesn't know

21:13.856 --> 21:15.691
it only has

21:15.733 --> 21:18.318
the third-best astrophysics

21:15.733 --> 21:18.318
department in the country.
