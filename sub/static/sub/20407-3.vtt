Pure attention to detail.

While Nona...

00:29.030 --> 00:29.930

the halibut perfectly.

Yes, Chef.

Runny mash.

01:04.799 --> 01:05.832
You're a waste
of life.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.933

Had had enough of Raj.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.435
Bro, you're 50 years old,

And...

For elimination.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.515
But there was one performance
that Chef Ramsey

01:22.583 --> 01:23.783
could not forgive
or forget.

a shocking turn of events.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.336
I didn't lie, either.

03:28.142 --> 03:29.542

03:29.610 --> 03:31.678
I did not tell those people,

03:31.746 --> 03:34.013
"do not order sides."

dragging down the kitchen,

03:55.436 --> 03:56.236
because we're all trying
really hard.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.837

<i>to listen to me.</i>

04:29.537 --> 04:30.904
Raj listens to you?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.405
Yeah, I've been
one of the few guys

04:32.473 --> 04:33.706
that hasn't yelled
and screamed at him.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.275
If I can just get Raj
to focus, I will.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.944
We need to learn to work with
the tools that we're given.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.913
He just happens to be
one of those tools.

You have to handle him
with kid gloves, though.

bacon, and sausage.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.571
Who's good at making omelets?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.740
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsey, sensing problems,
among the Chefs,

07:20.808 --> 07:22.408
is testing each kitchen's
ability

07:22.476 --> 07:23.843
to work as a team.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.878
I need to see
a team effort, okay?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.981
(All)
Yes, Chef!

07:28.048 --> 07:29.749
(Announcer)
The team that serves their side
of the dining room first

07:29.817 --> 07:31.184
wins the challenge.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.251
How about for you, sir?

07:34.922 --> 07:36.022
Okay.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.857
Okay, ladies,
here we go.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.158
Can't send anything out
until the fruit salad's gone.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.593
Come on, guys!
Come on!

07:40.661 --> 07:44.263
We do not want
to lose anymore challenges.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.832
Hey, we can do this.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.634
I got pineapple,
she's doing cantaloupes.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.369
We need to slice the bread
for the french toast.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.370
I say we get
two guys on fruit.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.504
It's gotta go first.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.972
We cannot send anything out

07:53.040 --> 07:54.674
uit
has gone.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.309
<i>So naturally,</i>
<i>there should be</i>

07:56.377 --> 07:57.410
two or three of you
on the fruit.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.745
<i>(Rob)</i>
<i>Who's sliding over?</i>

07:58.812 --> 07:59.979
<i>We need fruit cut</i>
<i>right away.</i>

08:00.047 --> 08:01.314
Nobody slid over.
Nobody helped me.

08:01.382 --> 08:02.515
I was doing my thing.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.183
I was doing as best
I can out there.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.152
I got strawberries
ready for a bowl!

08:06.220 --> 08:07.787
<i>Good, put 'em in</i>
<i>the silver bowl, please.</i>

08:07.855 --> 08:10.156
You got this, Lady.
Right here, girl.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.391
<i>We need to talk.</i>

08:11.458 --> 08:13.059
(Gail)
Sometimes, we don't get along.

08:13.127 --> 08:14.727
But we're actually
working together,

08:14.795 --> 08:16.029
and we're listening
to each other.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.430
It's just such a good feeling.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.865
Service, please.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.436
And the ladies have sent
two bowls of fruit salad.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.004
Hurry up, guys, yes?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.773
Raj, we need egg whites
right away, brother.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.574
No we don't, we need
the [Bleep] Fruit right away.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.709
Go, sell it.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.144
Fruit's gotta go!

08:31.211 --> 08:32.245
[Bleep].

08:32.312 --> 08:33.346
Uh, guys,

08:33.414 --> 08:35.014
where's
the [Bleep] Pineapple?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.416
My fault.
That's my fault.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.150
Right here, Chef.
Bring it back!

08:38.217 --> 08:39.652
Their not being able
to put together a fruit salad

08:39.720 --> 08:41.821
is pretty embarrassing
for a professional.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.589
<i>Let's go!</i>

08:43.657 --> 08:45.558
Six. Six fruit,
six fruit.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.360
(Announcer)
While the welcoming fruit bowls

08:47.428 --> 08:48.861
have finally
left the blue kitchen,

08:48.929 --> 08:50.897
the women are starting
to fill orders.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.432
Six french toast,
one omelet

08:52.499 --> 08:53.633
is on your
first table, yes?

08:53.701 --> 08:54.867
Yes, Chef!

08:54.935 --> 08:56.569
Emily! Bacon and sausage.
Got it?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.071
<i>Cool.</i>
Thank you!

08:58.138 --> 08:59.405
We just worked like a machine,

08:59.473 --> 09:01.074
scrambling, scrambling eggs.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.709
We have to work together.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.143
We can win this.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.344
Come on, guys!
Come on, guys, calm down.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.679
Do it, do it!

09:06.747 --> 09:08.047
Eggs right here!
Eggs right here.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.482
Hot handle.
Be careful.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.050
Okay, let's go.
Table 30, please.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.852
(Announcer)
The women,uild
on their victory

09:12.920 --> 09:14.187
in last night's
dinner service,

09:14.254 --> 09:15.755
push out their first orders.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.290
Looks great.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.058
(Announcer)
And over on the blue side,

09:19.126 --> 09:20.493
the men are just
trying to keep up.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.828
Guys, the girls are
setting the tables

09:21.895 --> 09:23.262
faster than you are.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.731
Right now, they got
three tables out.

09:24.798 --> 09:25.698
<i>You don't even</i>
<i>have one out yet.</i>

09:25.766 --> 09:27.100
<i>No, we have--</i>

09:27.167 --> 09:28.868
guys, the omelet's
just sitting here!

09:28.936 --> 09:30.536
<i>Come on, guys,</i>
<i>let's push this out!</i>

09:30.604 --> 09:31.671
Come on!

09:33.207 --> 09:34.640
Burnt on the bottom.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.542
Tried to cover it up
in the fold.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.211
I don't want so much color
on egg white omelets.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.879
It's supposed to be
egg <i>white,</i> yes?

09:39.947 --> 09:40.880
Let's go.
I'm not serving that.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.014
<i>No chance.</i>

09:42.082 --> 09:43.149
It's an omelet,
for crying out loud.

09:43.217 --> 09:44.317
Eggs aren't hard.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.518
That's like screwing up
boiled water.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.519
You're an idiot.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.620
Start it over again!

09:47.688 --> 09:49.288
Boris!
Yes, Chef!

09:49.356 --> 09:51.624
Your eyesight's perfect.
I got it checked this morning.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.659
Standards!

09:53.727 --> 09:56.028
(Announcer)
While the men concentrate
on remaking their first order...

09:56.096 --> 09:57.463
Guys, get me
the spatula!

09:57.531 --> 09:58.931
It's right there
in front of you!

09:58.999 --> 10:00.333
Thank you.
Sorry, guys.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.501
(Announcer)
Over in the red kitchen,

10:01.568 --> 10:02.668
the women are focused on...

10:02.736 --> 10:04.437
Two bacons!
Two bacons!

10:04.505 --> 10:06.706
You're on bacon, Emily!
Emily!

10:06.774 --> 10:07.974
I was like--
looked at Emily,

10:08.041 --> 10:09.542
and I en her stupid face.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.110
And I was like, "she's not
[Bleep] Doing anything."

10:11.178 --> 10:12.445
I got your bacon
and sausage!

10:12.513 --> 10:14.814
So I go to the oven.

10:14.882 --> 10:15.982
<i>[Bleep].</i>
<i>Over here, Chef.</i>

10:18.719 --> 10:20.753
Emily couldn't even
watch the [Bleep] Bacon.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.622
You stupid bitch.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.390
You didn't have to do
anything else!

10:24.458 --> 10:25.424
Just make sure
it doesn't burn.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.926
I'm sorry.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.362
<i>Just get bacon in the pan!</i>
<i>Get bacon in the pan!</i>

10:29.429 --> 10:31.497
Emily, just open your eyes.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.599
Am, Chef.
Unbelievable.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.901
<i>I need four bacons!</i>

10:34.968 --> 10:36.936
Bacon's coming!
Bacon's coming!

10:37.004 --> 10:38.504
Bacon right now!
Bacon right now!

10:38.572 --> 10:40.039
Come on, bacon, right now
right now!

10:40.107 --> 10:41.440
<i>Come on, ladies!</i>

10:41.508 --> 10:42.875
There you go.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.343
(Announcer)
Thanks to Sabrina and Melissa,

10:44.411 --> 10:45.945
the hungry emts
on the red side

10:46.013 --> 10:47.814
have something
to cheer about.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.616
Meanwhile, over
on the blue side...

10:50.684 --> 10:54.687
It's a completely
different story.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.556
<i>We look like a bunch</i>
<i>of [Bleep] Amateurs.</i>

10:56.623 --> 10:57.957
Not even one table yet.

10:58.025 --> 10:58.858
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Raj!</i>

10:58.859 --> 10:59.792
Where's the scra

10:59.860 --> 11:00.893
okay.

11:05.132 --> 11:08.267
Gotta get these out.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.802
Hey, guys, guys.
Come here.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.470
All of you, come here.
Quick!

11:11.538 --> 11:13.206
Hurry up.
Get out of the way.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.340
Get out of the way.
Ooh, get out of the way.

11:14.408 --> 11:15.474
Taste it.
Taste it!

11:15.542 --> 11:18.311
Taste it, taste it,
taste it, taste it!

11:18.378 --> 11:19.812
Not an ounce of seasoning!

11:19.880 --> 11:20.880
What do you--

11:20.948 --> 11:21.981
we're doing it again.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.015
<i>Don't argue with Chef!</i>

11:23.083 --> 11:24.617
Don't talk back to Chef.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.852
He says something,
you say, "yes, Chef,"

11:25.919 --> 11:26.919
and move on--
that's it.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.154
Say that again.
Hey, say that again.

11:28.222 --> 11:29.488
No, che--
yes, Chef!

11:29.556 --> 11:30.656
Don't spit [Bleep]
In my face!

11:30.724 --> 11:32.225
Say that again.

11:37.237 --> 11:38.905
(Announcer)
In a true test of teamwork,

11:38.972 --> 11:40.139
the red team
has come together

11:40.207 --> 11:41.441
and served over
half their diners.

11:41.508 --> 11:42.909
That looks really good.

11:42.976 --> 11:44.076
(Announcer)
The men, however,

11:44.144 --> 11:45.044
haven't served
a single table

11:45.112 --> 11:46.112
and are at a standstill.

11:46.180 --> 11:47.980
Taste it!

11:48.048 --> 11:49.882
(Announcer)
Thanks to Raj's
unseasoned eggs.

11:49.950 --> 11:51.150
Not an ounce
of seasoning!

11:51.218 --> 11:52.351
What are you--

11:52.419 --> 11:53.453
we're doing it again!

11:53.520 --> 11:54.754
<i>Don't argue with Chef!</i>

11:54.822 --> 11:56.189
Say that again.
Hey, say that again.

11:56.256 --> 11:57.523
No, che--
yes, Chef!

11:57.591 --> 11:58.825
Don't spit [Bleep]
In my face!

11:58.892 --> 12:00.460
Say that again.

12:00.527 --> 12:02.161
Say that again.
Yes, Chef.

12:02.229 --> 12:03.629
There's not an ounce
of [Bleep] Seasoning in that.

12:03.697 --> 12:05.565
These guys
save life for a living.

12:05.632 --> 12:06.966
Yeah, and you're about
to [Bleep] Up their breakfast.

12:07.034 --> 12:07.967
Got it?

12:08.035 --> 12:09.769
Yes, Chef!

12:09.837 --> 12:11.571
Chef Ramsey is like,

12:11.638 --> 12:13.039
"oh, my God!
There's no salt!

12:13.106 --> 12:14.807
There's no pepper!"

12:14.875 --> 12:16.209
And I'm like,
"what the--"

12:16.276 --> 12:17.543
go ahead, go ahead.
Go! Go!

12:17.611 --> 12:19.278
I thought I seasoned it,
Chef, correctly.

12:19.346 --> 12:21.180
But, no, obviously
I didn't.

12:21.248 --> 12:22.748
Why is he cooking
scrambled egg

12:22.816 --> 12:24.450
when he can't even
season it?

12:24.518 --> 12:26.919
I try to make some sense
out of this intense chaos.

12:26.987 --> 12:28.120
I gotta cool off somehow.

12:28.188 --> 12:29.789
I tried to clear my head

12:29.857 --> 12:31.691
by sticking my head
in the refrigerator.

12:31.758 --> 12:32.725
But I couldn't.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.726
Raj!

12:33.794 --> 12:35.094
Move your fat [Bleep] Ass!

12:37.564 --> 12:40.032
Somebody take control,
please!

12:40.100 --> 12:41.300
Come on, guys,
let's keep pushing!

12:41.368 --> 12:42.401
Turkey bacon's going in!

12:42.469 --> 12:43.970
<i>We got this!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

12:44.037 --> 12:45.638
Keep moving!
This is important!

12:45.706 --> 12:47.073
Wipe that off.
Wipe it off.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.175
N)
<i>It's on fire. Oh, no.</i>

12:49.243 --> 12:50.543
Who's in control here?

12:50.611 --> 12:53.246
Come on, guys,
let's push this out!

12:53.313 --> 12:54.380
Disaster.

12:54.448 --> 12:56.883
Absolutely disaster.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.651
(Announcer)
While the blue team

12:58.719 --> 12:59.986
can't get out
of the starting blocks...

13:00.053 --> 13:01.687
You don't need four guys
on french toast!

13:01.755 --> 13:04.223
(Announcer)
The red team is racing
to the finish line.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.425
This is your last table!

13:06.493 --> 13:07.693
Come on, ladies!
Come on!

13:07.761 --> 13:09.695
[Overlapping shouting]

13:09.763 --> 13:11.430
'Scuse me.

13:11.498 --> 13:13.900

Ladies, two seconds, please.

13:31.051 --> 13:32.485
(All)
Yes, Chef!

13:32.553 --> 13:33.853
Each of you
pair up with one of the guys

13:33.921 --> 13:35.254
and get their breakfast out.

13:35.322 --> 13:36.489
Yes, Chef!

13:36.557 --> 13:37.523
Hustlehustle, hustle.

13:37.591 --> 13:39.325
We got hungry emts!

13:39.393 --> 13:40.927
(Announcer)
With the women
coming to the rescue...

13:40.994 --> 13:42.328
Here you go, Chef.
Walking.

13:42.396 --> 13:43.930
The men finally
finish serving breakfast

13:43.997 --> 13:45.431
to the remaining emts.

13:45.499 --> 13:47.133
[Overlappi

13:47.200 --> 13:49.302

Great finish.

Thank you, Chef.
Thank you, Chef.

13:51.071 --> 13:53.606
Gentlemen...

13:53.674 --> 13:54.740
Clear down.

13:54.808 --> 13:57.310
[Bleep] Embarrassing.

14:00.681 --> 14:02.014
Ladies...
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

14:02.082 --> 14:03.849
<i>That was teamwork.</i>

14:03.917 --> 14:05.318
Well done.

14:05.385 --> 14:06.552
(All)
Thank you, Chef.

14:06.620 --> 14:07.720
<i>You deserve a special day.</i>

14:07.788 --> 14:09.121
You're heading
to Santa Monica...

14:09.189 --> 14:10.990
Where you'll be
having lunch poolside.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.058
[Cheering]

14:12.125 --> 14:13.492
<i>Yes.</i>

14:13.560 --> 14:14.994
At one of L.A.'s
trendiest hotels, yes?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.295
<i>The viceroy.</i>

14:16.363 --> 14:17.897
Stunning, beautiful,
and quite cool.

14:17.965 --> 14:19.465
<i>Not only that,</i>

14:19.533 --> 14:21.934
but there's a big surprise
that will take place

14:22.002 --> 14:23.936
before that, which I don't
want to spoil it now,

14:24.004 --> 14:25.972
'cause it's--
it's--it's quite unique.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.873
Enjoy every minute of it,
'cause you deserve it.

14:27.941 --> 14:29.241
Well done.

14:29.309 --> 14:31.344
(Sabrina)
Finally, the girls win!

14:31.411 --> 14:33.145
And we get to be outside.

14:33.213 --> 14:35.247
We don't have to be cooped up in
Hell's Kitchen anymore.

14:35.315 --> 14:37.183
I love my red team!

14:37.250 --> 14:38.284
[Both whooping]

14:38.352 --> 14:39.819
Guys, hey.

14:39.886 --> 14:42.588
<i>I've never seen such</i>
<i>a disorganized team</i>

14:42.656 --> 14:45.091
working as individuals.

14:45.158 --> 14:46.459
Trev...
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

14:46.526 --> 14:48.194
<i>What did you see</i>
<i>in there?</i>

14:48.261 --> 14:49.762
<i>No communication at all,</i>
<i>whatsoever.</i>

14:49.830 --> 14:51.230
Everything just broke down
right in front of us.

14:51.298 --> 14:53.032
I tried to,
but everybody just went ahead

14:53.100 --> 14:54.600
and did
their own thing anyway.

14:54.668 --> 14:55.901
And that's
what you guys did.

14:55.969 --> 14:57.403
Stop! He's basically
screaming at us

14:57.471 --> 14:59.138
to get together
as a team,

14:59.206 --> 15:00.606
and it's a bunch
of individuals still!

15:00.674 --> 15:02.375
Exactly right.

15:02.442 --> 15:04.043
(Trev)
The blue team
is a complete disaster.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.678
Raj is bringing
the team down.

15:05.746 --> 15:07.346
He spent half the time
in the cooler.

15:07.414 --> 15:08.648
The guy's not contributing
at all.

15:08.715 --> 15:10.249
I just can't take it anymore.

15:10.317 --> 15:12.418
So take advantage
of what's happening today,

15:12.486 --> 15:14.086
because you're gonna be
spending a lot of time together.

15:14.154 --> 15:15.588
<i>We're gonna be serving</i>

15:15.656 --> 15:17.890
unique cocktails
for the very first time

15:17.958 --> 15:19.392
<i>in Hell's Kitchen</i>
<i>tomorrow night.</i>

15:19.459 --> 15:20.926
<i>For your punishment today,</i>

15:20.994 --> 15:25.498
I want 250
beautiful stemware polished,

15:25.565 --> 15:27.733
ready for those cocktails.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.135
But there's more.

15:29.202 --> 15:30.536
<i>I want you</i>
<i>cleaning the kitchens.</i>

15:30.604 --> 15:32.004
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

15:32.072 --> 15:33.706
The loss today was tough.

15:33.774 --> 15:35.207
Having to clean kitchens
definitely sucks.

15:35.275 --> 15:37.810
Take advantage
of this time together

15:37.878 --> 15:39.178
and regroup.

15:39.246 --> 15:41.447
Because you [Bleep] Need it.

15:41.515 --> 15:42.948
Move.

15:43.016 --> 15:44.784
(Louis)
Hopefully, we get
our act together

15:44.851 --> 15:46.419
and start functioning
as a team.

15:46.486 --> 15:48.054
If we don't do that,
we're done.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.789
It'll be, uh,
all girls in the final.

15:49.856 --> 15:50.690
All the fruit.
Put it away.

15:50.757 --> 15:51.624
Please.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.128
Bye, guys.

15:56.196 --> 15:58.597
Whoo hoo! Man!

15:58.665 --> 16:00.299
Anything outside ohere
is awesome.

16:00.367 --> 16:02.034
[All cheering]

16:06.039 --> 16:07.773
Chef said there's something
really big

16:07.841 --> 16:09.108
that he hasn't told us
yet about.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.543
And it's a big surprise.

16:10.610 --> 16:11.877
[All cheering]

16:11.945 --> 16:16.449
Oh, my gosh,
we start walking up,

16:16.516 --> 16:17.883
welcome to trapeze school.

16:17.951 --> 16:19.285
(Melissa)
And I'm psyched,

16:19.352 --> 16:20.486
'cause I've never
done trapeze

16:20.554 --> 16:22.088
or anything before.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.422
This is what you guys
are gonna be learning today.

16:23.490 --> 16:27.326
[Laughter and cheers]

16:27.394 --> 16:30.296
Oh, you're gonna be
gonna be going on the trapeze.

16:30.363 --> 16:31.931
I was like,
"hell, yeah, dude.

16:31.998 --> 16:34.800
I climbed up that ladder
so fast.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.569
(Instructor)
All right, feet together,
legs straight!

16:36.636 --> 16:37.803
Legs straight!
Legs straight!

16:37.871 --> 16:39.238
Hanging upside down
in mid-air.

16:39.306 --> 16:40.506
Yeah!

16:40.574 --> 16:42.341
It was crazy.

16:42.409 --> 16:44.143
(Announcer)
While the women
are hanging out...

16:44.211 --> 16:46.212
Back at Hell's Kitchen,

16:46.279 --> 16:47.980
one Chef is just
hanging around.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.081
Don't be scared, Raj.

16:49.149 --> 16:50.716
Jump in.
I was.

16:50.784 --> 16:52.218
<i>Everybody's polishing.</i>
<i>You're just kind of standing.</i>

16:52.285 --> 16:53.419
You're blowing it
with me.

16:53.487 --> 16:55.054
The one guy
that had your back,

16:55.122 --> 16:55.755
you're blowing it
with me.
Ah, please.

16:55.822 --> 16:56.989
Trevor, he's--

16:57.057 --> 16:59.158
he's really
not a nice person.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.227
And he's also
being very mean.

17:01.294 --> 17:03.629
What do you want us
to do with you?

17:03.697 --> 17:05.330
I'm a professional Chef.

17:05.397 --> 17:07.233
I'm working with
a bunch of kids.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.567
I'm in this situation where
it's me versus them.

17:08.635 --> 17:10.603
Water marks.
[laughs] Water marks.

17:10.670 --> 17:13.071
Raj, seriously, I mean,
can that?

17:13.140 --> 17:14.205
Are you gonna look?

17:14.273 --> 17:15.608
Just do his glasses over.

17:15.675 --> 17:16.709
<i>That's not fair.</i>

17:16.777 --> 17:17.810
Just do it over.

17:17.877 --> 17:19.078
This is harassment now.

17:19.146 --> 17:20.780
[Laughter]

17:24.184 --> 17:25.751
Right, ladies.
Come over.

17:25.819 --> 17:27.486
<i>Come and sit down.</i>

17:27.554 --> 17:28.621
How was it?

17:28.688 --> 17:30.156
[All talking at once]

17:30.223 --> 17:31.791
You walk into the Viceroy,

17:31.858 --> 17:33.659
you feel like you're
just somebody special.

17:33.727 --> 17:35.027
It nice to be out?

17:35.095 --> 17:36.428
(All)
Yes, Chef.

17:36.496 --> 17:38.130
It's absolutely perfect.

17:38.198 --> 17:39.765
Never in a million years
would I ever imagine

17:39.833 --> 17:43.202
that me, Nona,
sitting next to Chef Ramsey.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.071
I mean, whatever!
Felt like a superstar.

17:46.139 --> 17:47.273
Oh, [Bleep]!

17:47.340 --> 17:49.608
[Laughter]

17:49.676 --> 17:51.177
<i>You are okay?</i>

17:51.244 --> 17:54.079
[Laughter]

17:54.147 --> 17:55.648
I was a little glad

17:55.715 --> 17:57.550
that a champagne cup
poured all over me,

17:57.617 --> 18:00.219
because Chef Ramsey
was patting me down.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.754
Somebody's cold.

18:01.822 --> 18:02.922
Now...
[laughter]

18:02.989 --> 18:03.989
What?

18:04.057 --> 18:05.024
[Laughter]

18:05.091 --> 18:06.025
<i>You okay?</i>

18:06.092 --> 18:07.960
Okay, let's try that again.

18:08.028 --> 18:08.928
<i>Good job.</i>

18:08.995 --> 18:10.496
And a great Bond as well.

18:10.564 --> 18:11.864
That's what our plan is.

18:11.932 --> 18:13.599
We plan on winning again,

18:13.667 --> 18:15.434
'cause we just wanna make
Chef Ramsey proud.

18:15.502 --> 18:17.336
We're trying to stick together

18:17.404 --> 18:20.706
and watch the guys do nothing
but fight and argue.

18:20.774 --> 18:22.041
<i>What's this, Raj?</i>

18:22.108 --> 18:23.542
Raj...

18:23.610 --> 18:25.377
You just give up halfway?

18:25.445 --> 18:26.679
Nah, I just wanted
to cover it.

18:26.746 --> 18:28.614
Give me the [Bleep] Wrap.

18:28.682 --> 18:30.416
I've tried everything I can
with this big, dumb animal,

18:30.483 --> 18:31.784
and it's just,
it's frustrating.

18:31.852 --> 18:33.152
It's tiring.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.387
That's [Bleep]
That he's even still here.

18:35.455 --> 18:37.056
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, wait.

18:37.123 --> 18:38.591
You might have been
cooking the longest.

18:38.658 --> 18:39.291
Obviously you cooked
in [Bleep] Restaurants

18:39.359 --> 18:40.292
for the last 30 years.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.427
Unfair.

18:41.494 --> 18:43.395
What's unfair about it?
You suck!

18:43.463 --> 18:45.231
And you tanked us.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.199
You guys gonna
keep going with it?
<i>Yes!</i>

18:47.267 --> 18:48.467
Till it gets through
that thick skull of yours!

18:48.535 --> 18:51.237
Trevng me
for no reason.

18:51.304 --> 18:54.440
And he's being more
of a problem than a solution.

18:54.507 --> 18:56.508
You guys seem to be
targeting me

18:56.576 --> 18:58.244
<i>in a vicious fashion.</i>

18:58.311 --> 18:59.879
You got something
against me because I'm older?

18:59.946 --> 19:02.381
Go home, Raj.
Me.

19:02.449 --> 19:04.383
<i>Go home and stuff yourself</i>
<i>with twinkies</i>

19:04.451 --> 19:06.051
so you have [Bleep] Heart attack
on your recliner.

19:06.119 --> 19:08.053
Oh, so now you're gonna
make fun of my weight.

19:08.121 --> 19:09.922
We gotta figure out
what you're good at.

19:09.990 --> 19:11.123
You gotta be good
at something, right?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.491
Aside from sleepin'
and [Bleep] Eatin'

19:12.559 --> 19:13.792
and running your
[Bleep] Damn jaw,

19:13.860 --> 19:14.860
you gotta be good
at somethin'.

19:14.928 --> 19:17.029
Mr. "I'm a Chef
and I'm almost 50,

19:17.097 --> 19:18.864
<i>i got more experience</i>
<i>than everybody."</i>

19:18.932 --> 19:20.799
What the [Bleep]
Have you done so far?

19:20.867 --> 19:22.501
You [Bleep] Dillydally
in the [Bleep] Pastry section!

19:22.569 --> 19:23.736
Shut up!

19:23.803 --> 19:25.671
Shut up!

19:25.739 --> 19:27.573
Shut up!
Shut the [Bleep] Up!

19:33.807 --> 19:35.475
What the [Bleep]
Have you done so far?

19:35.542 --> 19:36.342
(Announcer)
Near the end of a long,

19:36.410 --> 19:37.310
punishing day...

19:37.377 --> 19:38.578
Shut up!

19:38.645 --> 19:40.179
(Announcer)
A non-stop verbal war

19:40.247 --> 19:42.014
between Raj and Trev
is at its peak.

19:42.082 --> 19:44.517
Shut up!
Shut the [Bleep] Up!

19:44.585 --> 19:45.685
<i>Or what?</i>

19:45.752 --> 19:47.053
Guys, guys..
I said shut up!

19:47.121 --> 19:48.121
<i>Just shut up!</i>
<i>Or what?</i>

19:48.188 --> 19:49.288
<i>[Bleep] All you [Bleep]!</i>

19:49.356 --> 19:51.691
You guys are
a bunch of snakes!

19:51.758 --> 19:53.826
You [Bleep] Snake!

19:53.894 --> 19:56.429
I'm being targeted.
I'm being harassed.

19:56.497 --> 19:58.598
And I really am
at the point where

19:58.665 --> 20:00.099
I don't know what to do.

20:00.167 --> 20:01.367
Raj, can I have
a word with you?

20:01.435 --> 20:02.635
I'm tired of this!
One minute.

20:02.703 --> 20:03.870
<i>Listen to me.</i>

20:03.937 --> 20:05.304
Listen to me.
Raj, please.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.506
Raj, Raj.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.542
We need to listen
and work together.

20:09.610 --> 20:11.377
I don't want to see
anybody get hurt.

20:11.445 --> 20:12.578
I don't want to see
anybody thrown off

20:12.646 --> 20:13.146
'cause we need every
man on our team,

20:13.213 --> 20:14.046
including Raj.

20:14.114 --> 20:15.348
I got in--
listen to me.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.849
[Exhales]
You all right?

20:16.917 --> 20:19.352
But that guy
is [Bleep] Nuts.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.920
Deep breath.
Chi.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.158
(Raj)
I'm fine.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.493
(Announcer)
After a day of highs
for the women...

20:27.561 --> 20:29.328
And a day of lows
for the men,

20:29.396 --> 20:31.597
everyone crashes
for the night.

20:36.203 --> 20:38.237
The next morning,
the Chefs are back at it.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.306
All right, gentlemen,
let's crank.

20:40.374 --> 20:41.274
(Announcer)
And the men
are looking for Raj

20:41.341 --> 20:42.842
to turn it around.

20:42.910 --> 20:45.111
I need you to talk, Raj.
Do not shut down.

20:45.179 --> 20:47.079
Okay, you got it, man.

20:47.147 --> 20:48.281
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, the women
are looking for...

20:48.348 --> 20:49.015
Where's Sabrina?

20:51.618 --> 20:54.020
I do not want to be
in Hell's Kitchen

20:54.087 --> 20:56.155
for another day of prep.

20:56.223 --> 20:58.724
I just don't think
that Chef Ramsey's

20:58.792 --> 21:00.626
looking for a [Bleep]
Strong prep cook.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.228
So what else
do we need now?

21:02.296 --> 21:03.629
Where's your list
from last night?

21:03.697 --> 21:04.931
Um...

21:04.998 --> 21:06.666
Why I'm gonna
waste my [Bleep] Time

21:06.733 --> 21:08.134
writing a [Bleep] Prep list

21:08.202 --> 21:10.269
is just ridiculous.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.804
<i>Uh, Sabrina.</i>

21:11.872 --> 21:13.839
<i>Did you already put</i>
<i>the Risotto in there?</i>

21:16.009 --> 21:18.211
(Melissa)
Sabrina, when it comes to prep,

21:18.278 --> 21:20.213
she just doesn't seem
that she's focused.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.948
And right now,
I'm very, very nervous

21:22.015 --> 21:23.316
about her performance tonight.

21:27.087 --> 21:28.688
(Announcer)
While the women were able
to complete

21:28.755 --> 21:30.456
their last dinner service...

21:30.524 --> 21:31.824
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>All right, ladies, let's go.</i>

21:31.892 --> 21:33.192
(Announcer)
This year's men's team

21:33.260 --> 21:35.361
has had two of the worst
dinner services ever.

21:35.429 --> 21:37.296
Right, gentlemen.
So far,

21:37.364 --> 21:38.564
<i>your history</i>

21:38.632 --> 21:39.699
in Hell's Kitchen

21:39.766 --> 21:41.667
<i>has been a disaster.</i>

21:41.735 --> 21:43.436
<i>The weakest start</i>

21:43.503 --> 21:45.371
ever.

21:45.439 --> 21:47.073
It is comeback night.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.374
(All)
Yes, Chef!

21:48.442 --> 21:49.675
Raj, haven't
given up on you.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.544
<i>However, push it tonight.</i>

21:51.612 --> 21:53.012
Yes, Chef!
Come back.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.313
Yes, Chef!

21:54.381 --> 21:55.348
And stay out
of the [Bleep] Fridge.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.252
Yes, Chef.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.354
As always,
here in Hell's Kitchen,

22:01.421 --> 22:02.922
we like to sort of
raise the bar,

22:02.990 --> 22:04.056
keeping it
somewhat trendy.

22:04.124 --> 22:05.358
Tonight,
for the very first time,

22:05.425 --> 22:07.059
<i>each guest will receive</i>

22:07.127 --> 22:08.794
<i>a stunning, delicious,</i>

22:08.862 --> 22:11.330
culinary cocktail.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.798
<i>One person from each kitchen</i>

22:12.866 --> 22:14.467
will be making
these cocktails.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.669
<i>Ladies...</i>

22:16.737 --> 22:18.137
Sabrina.
Yes, Chef.

22:18.205 --> 22:19.972
It's you.
Ay.

22:20.040 --> 22:20.973
Make them,
don't drink them.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.342
Yes, Chef.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.312
Ye <i>yeah, you're fast?</i>

22:26.380 --> 22:26.946
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>
<i>Do it.</i>

22:27.014 --> 22:28.147
Okay.

22:28.260 --> 22:29.429
They couldn't have picked
a better guy.

22:30.117 --> 22:31.350
My personality carries
a hell of a lot better

22:31.418 --> 22:33.352
than a set of
[Bleep] And good hair.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.987
Now, tonight,
should be no excuses.

22:35.055 --> 22:36.522
Third service,
third time lucky.

22:36.590 --> 22:37.456
(All)
Yes, Chef.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.691
Let's go.

22:38.759 --> 22:40.293
U know you got it.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.494
<i>All right, bro,</i>
<i>kick ass.</i>

22:41.561 --> 22:43.262
Right, James...
Chef.

22:43.330 --> 22:44.430
Let's go, please.
Open Hell's Kitchen.

22:44.498 --> 22:45.197
Yes, Chef.

(Announcer)
As Hell's Kitchen opens
for another ce...

23:01.815 --> 23:03.215
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen.

23:03.283 --> 23:04.784
I'm gonna be
serving you guys

23:04.851 --> 23:05.918
some very special
cocktails tonight.

23:05.986 --> 23:07.253
Ouncer)
The women...

23:07.321 --> 23:08.954
Ready...To rock and roll!

23:09.022 --> 23:10.956
(Announcer)
Are hoping their momentum
continues,

23:11.024 --> 23:13.159
while the men
may just be hoping...

23:13.226 --> 23:14.560
Whoop.
Oopy woopy.

23:14.628 --> 23:16.228
(Announcer)
For a miracle.

23:16.296 --> 23:17.596
<i>Raj, you good?</i>
Yeah, yeah. No worry.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.231
Now you get to see
the Raj.

23:19.299 --> 23:21.300
We got some serious issues
on my team.

23:21.368 --> 23:22.335
Everybody hates me,

23:22.402 --> 23:23.369
la la la la.

23:23.437 --> 23:25.938
But I'm a great Chef.

23:26.006 --> 23:26.939
Okay, guys,
here we go.

23:27.007 --> 23:28.407
(As, Chef!

23:28.475 --> 23:30.076
Two spaghetti,
one scallop, one chowder, yes?

23:30.143 --> 23:31.310
(All)
Yes, Chef!
Let's go.

23:31.378 --> 23:32.578
(Announcer)
Vinny on the appetizers

23:32.646 --> 23:34.213
is working with Raj
on the fish station

23:34.281 --> 23:35.881
to get the starters out.

23:35.949 --> 23:39.652
I am an excellent
poissonnier.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.487
Everybody loves my food.

23:41.555 --> 23:43.155
Everybody knows my food.

23:43.223 --> 23:44.757
I've been written up.
Just Google my name.

23:44.825 --> 23:46.859
Two spaghetti,
one scallop, one chowder.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.494
How long?
Four minutes!

23:48.562 --> 23:49.628
Scallop up!

23:49.696 --> 23:51.931
Oh, come on.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.233
So you're four minutes out and
the scallop's already cooked.

23:54.301 --> 23:55.668
I don't know.

23:55.736 --> 23:57.269
Ah, [Bleep] Me.

23:57.337 --> 23:59.171
Refry new scallops.
I got four minutes.

23:59.239 --> 24:01.140
Scallops, you can't
cook ahead of time.

24:01.208 --> 24:02.675
When they're ready,
they need to go out.

24:02.743 --> 24:03.976
<i>Yo, Raj, please,</i>

24:04.044 --> 24:05.311
make sure
those are perfect.

24:05.379 --> 24:06.212
Dude, I cannot
refire this order.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.213
Thank you, vin.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.347
Come on, guys!

24:08.415 --> 24:10.549
Our first [Bleep] Table!

24:10.617 --> 24:14.120
(Announcer)
While Raj refires his scallops,
in the red kitchen...

24:14.187 --> 24:16.455
Can you taste this?
'Cause I don't like tomatoes.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.157
(Announcer)
Jillian and Emily
work together

24:18.225 --> 24:19.658
to get their first
appetizers out.

24:19.726 --> 24:20.793
Mo salt.

24:22.696 --> 24:24.130
I have an excellent palate.

24:24.197 --> 24:26.198
<i>More salt.</i>
<i>A tiny pinch.</i>

24:26.266 --> 24:28.434
I don't know what's up
with that girls,

24:28.502 --> 24:30.269
but she could not salt
for the life of her.

24:30.337 --> 24:33.939
I almost wanted to, like,
just pour in the salt.

24:34.007 --> 24:35.574
Two scallops
and spaghetti, yes?

24:35.642 --> 24:36.876
My spaghetti's ready.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.778
Service, please.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.646
(Announcer)
It's only 18 minutes
into dinner service,

24:40.714 --> 24:42.081
and the red team's
first appetizers

24:42.149 --> 24:43.449
are making their way
out to the dining room.

24:46.753 --> 24:49.221
Unfortunately, they don't
stay there for long.

24:49.289 --> 24:50.389
What's wrong with that?

24:50.457 --> 24:51.924
Red team, salty.

24:51.992 --> 24:53.659
Oh, dear.
Ladies!

24:53.727 --> 24:54.960
(Both)
Yes, Chef?

24:55.028 --> 24:57.062
<i>Now it's coming back.</i>
<i>Salty!</i>

24:57.130 --> 24:58.297
<i>Wow.</i>

24:58.365 --> 25:00.065
(Jillian)
Emily's just unbelievable.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.400
I shouldn't even have
counted on her

25:01.468 --> 25:02.701
to do [Bleep] For me.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.036
She just don't know
how to do anything.

25:04.104 --> 25:07.873
Taste! Taste! Taste!

25:07.941 --> 25:09.008
I don't think
it's salty.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.976
<i>I don't think so.</i>

25:11.044 --> 25:12.711
(Announcer)
With both kitchens
having setbacks

25:12.779 --> 25:16.549
on the appetizer section...

25:16.616 --> 25:18.951
(Announcer)
The pressure shifts
to Sabrina and Trev,

25:19.019 --> 25:20.586
who are supposed to be making
welcoming culinary cocktails

25:20.654 --> 25:21.954
for the diners.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.255
Have you got
any drinks out yet?

25:23.323 --> 25:25.858
No.
We need to get them out.

25:25.926 --> 25:27.693
James is like,
righin your face, like,

25:27.761 --> 25:29.962
"come on, we need the cocktails.
We need the cocktails."

25:30.030 --> 25:31.464
Come on,
get a move on!

25:31.531 --> 25:32.932
I don't need to be
told what to do.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.166
Hurry up.

25:34.234 --> 25:35.701
I am the one
seasoned bartender

25:35.769 --> 25:37.303
working, uh, you know,
in Hell's Kitchen.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.405
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is cocktail time.

25:39.473 --> 25:40.840
<i>Ah, there we go.</i>

25:40.907 --> 25:42.174
I stand and I liver.

25:42.242 --> 25:43.876
(Announcer)
Trev and Sabrina

25:43.944 --> 25:45.611
have finally pleased James
in the dining room.

25:45.679 --> 25:47.112
Back in the kitchens...

25:47.180 --> 25:48.314
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Service, please.</i>

25:48.381 --> 25:50.416
Table 21 and table 10, yes?

25:50.484 --> 25:52.384
(Announcer)
Both teams have finally
pleased Chef Ramsey.

25:52.452 --> 25:54.587
Delicious, that Risotto.
Thank you, Chef.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.689
[British accent] Perfect.
I like it.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.824
(Announcer)
One hour into dinner service,
eam...

25:58.892 --> 25:59.758
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Salmon...</i>

25:59.826 --> 26:00.726
The salmon's ready.

26:00.794 --> 26:02.127
Has moved onto entrees.

26:02.195 --> 26:03.429
That is perfect.

26:03.497 --> 26:05.397
I've personally
cooked thousands

26:05.465 --> 26:08.133
and thousands and thousands
of pieces of salmon in my life.

26:08.201 --> 26:09.602
What's that in there?
What--

26:09.669 --> 26:11.170
that's not grilled.
Oh, dear.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.771
<i>Raj!</i>

26:12.839 --> 26:14.473
What's that?

26:14.541 --> 26:16.809
What is that stock
he's putting in that salmon?

26:16.877 --> 26:18.844
<i>It's supposed</i>
<i>to be grilled, dude.</i>

26:18.912 --> 26:22.147
I grilled it and I finished it
with a little bit of sauce.

26:22.215 --> 26:24.149
Uhh.

26:24.217 --> 26:27.653
<i>No sauce, bro.</i>

26:27.721 --> 26:29.321
<i>Come on, get another one</i>
<i>going, bro.</i>

26:29.389 --> 26:31.257
My personal techniques
are not working

26:31.324 --> 26:32.525
for Chef Ramsey.

26:32.592 --> 26:33.859
Disgusting!

26:33.927 --> 26:35.327
He's the Chef,
it's his opinion.

26:35.395 --> 26:37.029
And I have zero opinion.

26:37.097 --> 26:38.397
Start over.

26:38.465 --> 26:40.432
(Announcer)
Raj's cooking techniques

26:40.500 --> 26:42.134
aren't cutting it
with Chef Ramsey.

26:42.202 --> 26:43.536
And in the red kitchen...

26:43.603 --> 26:45.170
Melissa, it's overcooked.

26:45.238 --> 26:46.939
(Announcer)
Neither are Melissa's.

26:47.007 --> 26:49.208
Out comes...
Look at that.

26:49.276 --> 26:50.509
Overcooked on the bottom.

26:50.577 --> 26:52.011
Crispy as [Bleep].

26:52.078 --> 26:54.246
And it looks like
Gandhi's flip-flop.

26:54.314 --> 26:55.814
<i>What a shame.</i>

26:55.882 --> 26:57.583
I don't know where
he comes up with this stuff.

26:57.651 --> 26:59.285
Gandhi didn't even
wear flip-flops.

26:59.352 --> 27:00.886
He lived in the jungle.

27:00.954 --> 27:02.288
I don't even think
the dude had shoes.

27:02.355 --> 27:03.422
Look at it underneath!

27:06.159 --> 27:07.826
[Bleep].

27:07.894 --> 27:09.995
(Announcer)
As Melissa starts over
on the Dover sole...

27:10.063 --> 27:11.597
Hopefully,
we'll get some food.

27:11.665 --> 27:13.032
(Announcer)
Guests on both sides

27:13.099 --> 27:14.567
of the dining room
continue to wait.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.201
We haven't been served
any entrees.

27:16.269 --> 27:17.169
(Announcer)
But not for long.

27:17.237 --> 27:18.304
In the blue kitchen...

27:18.371 --> 27:19.338
Where's the salmon?

27:19.406 --> 27:20.739
It's--it's two seconds!

27:20.807 --> 27:22.207
(Announcer)
Raj is ready

27:22.275 --> 27:23.208
with his second attempt
on the saln.

27:23.276 --> 27:25.177
One, two!

27:25.245 --> 27:27.212
I mean, 30 sec--
I mean, one minute.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.348
(Announcer)
Well, almost ready.

27:29.416 --> 27:31.150
Concentrate! I don't like
that "meh meh meh."

27:31.217 --> 27:32.518
Sorry to say that,
but it's true.

27:32.586 --> 27:34.353
What a [Bleep] Bozo.

27:34.421 --> 27:35.654
<i>Here it is.</i>
<i>Here it is.</i>

27:37.223 --> 27:38.457
Oh, dear.

27:38.525 --> 27:40.092
Raj!

27:40.160 --> 27:41.260
Come here, you.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.195
<i>It's raw.</i>

27:43.263 --> 27:45.130
It's...Raw!

27:45.198 --> 27:46.932
That's weird.
Okay.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.601
Come on, man!

27:48.668 --> 27:50.369
It's raw!

27:50.437 --> 27:52.371
The guy can't change
his underwear the right way.

27:52.439 --> 27:53.872
We haven't even served
the [Bleep] Entree.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.908
<i>I need to get food out!</i>

27:55.976 --> 27:57.176
<i>Oh, boy, here we go.</i>

27:57.243 --> 27:58.110
I've had enough!

28:06.116 --> 28:08.384
(Announcer)
90 minutes
into dinner service,

28:08.452 --> 28:11.287
and Raj's problems
on the fish station continue.

28:11.355 --> 28:12.322
This time...

28:12.389 --> 28:14.524
It's raw!

28:14.591 --> 28:16.125
Chef, could I--
would you mind

28:16.193 --> 28:17.160
if I said something,
Chef, or no?

28:17.227 --> 28:18.294
Not to me,
you're not.

28:18.362 --> 28:19.162
No, don't say
a damn thing.

28:19.229 --> 28:20.964
Just finish your tickets.

28:21.031 --> 28:22.899
You know the salmon
I gave you that you smashed?

28:22.967 --> 28:24.834
Right?

28:24.902 --> 28:26.436
I'm not this timid man

28:26.503 --> 28:28.037
who's just gonna sit back
and just say,

28:28.105 --> 28:30.540
[whimpering]
"Okay, Chef."

28:30.607 --> 28:33.609
You know, I'm going to
try to make a case for myself.

28:33.677 --> 28:35.712
Really, Chef, really,
of all the--all

28:35.779 --> 28:37.447
we're in the middle
of service right now,

28:37.514 --> 28:38.414
<i>and I want food.</i>

28:38.482 --> 28:39.449
Shut it!

28:39.516 --> 28:41.117
But, um...

28:41.185 --> 28:42.585
It's--it's hard.

28:42.653 --> 28:43.886
<i>I got it,</i>
<i>i got it, I got it.</i>

28:43.954 --> 28:45.154
No, don't--you--
don't!

28:45.222 --> 28:46.723
Hey, what do you think
this is, a talk show?

28:46.790 --> 28:47.724
No, no--

28:47.791 --> 28:48.958
cook your [Bleep] Dish!

28:49.026 --> 28:50.493
And shut your fat mouth!

28:50.561 --> 28:51.494
Yes, Chef.

28:53.297 --> 28:55.264
Vinny, get a piece
of salmon on there, yes?

28:55.332 --> 28:56.299
Yes, Chef.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.568
Raj just cannot cook.

28:58.635 --> 29:00.636
At all. Anything. Ever.

29:00.704 --> 29:02.138
Give me the tongs.

29:02.206 --> 29:03.806
So you have to over
and do it for him.

29:03.874 --> 29:05.775
Hot behind.
Salmon on the pass.

29:05.843 --> 29:07.310
<i>Perfect, let's go!</i>

29:07.378 --> 29:08.845
(Announcer)
Thanks to vinny,

29:08.912 --> 29:10.013
Raj's salmon is finally
on its way out

29:10.080 --> 29:11.014
to the dining room.

29:11.081 --> 29:12.882
All right.

29:12.950 --> 29:14.851
(Announcer)
And an hour and 45 minutes
into dinner service...

29:14.918 --> 29:15.918
It's all right here,
Chef.

29:15.986 --> 29:16.986
Nice.
Okay.

29:18.522 --> 29:19.589
(Announcer)
Both teams...

29:19.656 --> 29:20.890
52, yeah? Go.

29:20.958 --> 29:21.724
(Announcer)
Are back on track.

29:21.792 --> 29:22.692
Let's go.

29:22.760 --> 29:23.760
You need help?
No.

29:23.827 --> 29:25.161
Gail, you need anything?

29:25.229 --> 29:26.162
I do!
Good, what do you need?

29:26.230 --> 29:27.130
I need four gratin.

29:27.197 --> 29:28.498
Four gratin, heard.

29:28.565 --> 29:29.699
We're team players.

29:29.767 --> 29:31.100
We're helping each other out.

29:31.168 --> 29:32.335
Sides, three gratin,
one carrot.

29:32.403 --> 29:33.169
Do you have
the gratin?

29:33.237 --> 29:35.371
I do not.

29:35.439 --> 29:37.006
[Bleep].

29:37.074 --> 29:38.741
I thought you were
doing my gratin.

29:38.809 --> 29:40.009
I'm sorry.

29:40.077 --> 29:41.010
Emily is worthless.

29:41.078 --> 29:42.178
I got it.

29:42.246 --> 29:43.079
Ooh!

29:43.147 --> 29:45.715
Now I haork double tie

29:45.783 --> 29:47.083
because she
doesn't perform.

29:47.151 --> 29:48.551
Coming out now.

29:48.619 --> 29:50.920
Good girl, bingo.
Gold star.

29:50.988 --> 29:52.288
(Announcer)
With no help from Emily,

29:52.356 --> 29:53.623
Nona rallies on garnish.

29:53.690 --> 29:55.124
Service, please.

29:55.192 --> 29:56.793
(Announcer)
And completes the sides.

29:56.860 --> 29:58.361
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen,

29:58.429 --> 29:59.896
it's time for Boris to step
into the spotlight.

29:59.963 --> 30:01.697
Ington,
medium rare.

30:01.765 --> 30:03.399
How long?
30 seconds on the beef.

30:03.467 --> 30:04.934
Okay, let's go.

30:05.002 --> 30:06.803
If Chef Gordon Ramsey
wants medium-rare meat,

30:06.870 --> 30:09.038
then Chef Gordon Ramsey
gets medium rare meat.

30:09.106 --> 30:10.573
I'm a man of integrity.

30:10.641 --> 30:11.407
He's not getting
raw meat from me.

30:11.475 --> 30:12.175
Boris, let's go!

30:12.242 --> 30:13.810
Chef, I'm ready!

30:13.877 --> 30:15.044
Chef, hold on.

30:15.112 --> 30:16.279
It's raw, man.

30:16.346 --> 30:17.647
Oh, come on.

30:17.714 --> 30:19.549
I can't give you raw meat.

30:19.616 --> 30:22.051
<i>Sorry, Chef.</i>

30:22.119 --> 30:24.387
The last guy that I should
have to worry about is Boris.

30:24.455 --> 30:26.022
He should be fine
on his own.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.657
It's meat.
It ain't rocket science.

30:27.724 --> 30:29.192
Let's get another one.

30:29.259 --> 30:30.626
(Announcer)
Thanks to Boris,

30:30.694 --> 30:31.861
re leaving
chen.

30:31.929 --> 30:33.963
There you go.
Send it back.

30:34.031 --> 30:39.235
(Announcer)
But thanks to Raj, none of them
are going to waste.

30:39.303 --> 30:41.137
So I just, you know,
ate it.

30:41.205 --> 30:43.039
Raj, please don't do that.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.507
Look it,
he's eating, look.

30:44.575 --> 30:45.541
Haven't you got
enough in there?

30:45.609 --> 30:46.909
But that's so good.

30:46.977 --> 30:48.377
<i>It's really a waste.</i>
Wow.

30:48.445 --> 30:49.846
No, I mean,
just a quick little bite.

30:49.913 --> 30:50.847
It's really tasty.

30:50.914 --> 30:52.582
Oh, [Bleep] Off.

30:52.649 --> 30:55.151
How could Chef Ramsey blame me
for eating this delicious food?

30:55.219 --> 30:56.152
It's fantastic.

30:58.789 --> 31:01.290
(Announcer)
While Raj has snack time
in the blue kitchen,

31:01.358 --> 31:04.360
over in the red kitchen,
Gail...

31:04.428 --> 31:06.028
Has nap time.

31:06.096 --> 31:07.130
Wakey, wakey!

31:07.197 --> 31:09.265
<i>You're on fire.</i>

31:09.333 --> 31:10.399
(Nona)
Oh, my God.

31:10.467 --> 31:13.069
There is flames shooting up.

31:13.137 --> 31:14.637
And Gail was...
[raspberry]

31:14.705 --> 31:15.638
Nothin'.

31:15.706 --> 31:17.373
Nothin's happening.

31:17.441 --> 31:19.108
<i>Gail, out of the way!</i>

31:19.176 --> 31:21.711
Oh, my God.

31:21.778 --> 31:23.613
[Clatter]

31:23.680 --> 31:25.915
<i>Gail...</i>

31:25.983 --> 31:28.217
I think your pan's
a bit too hot.

31:28.285 --> 31:29.986
You've lost it.
I haven't lost it.

31:30.053 --> 31:31.654
Yes, you--
look, you've given up.

31:31.722 --> 31:32.955
Body language,
face, attitude.

31:33.023 --> 31:34.190
You've given up.

31:34.258 --> 31:35.725
Anyone that can
stand there

31:35.792 --> 31:37.693
<i>and watch a piece of</i>
<i>rib-eye beef</i>

31:37.761 --> 31:40.163
sit on fire
is out of control!

31:40.230 --> 31:42.698
You've given up.

31:42.766 --> 31:44.367
(Announcer)
Two hours into dinner service.E.

31:44.434 --> 31:45.334
Where's the beef?

31:45.402 --> 31:47.136
I'm walking on beef.

31:47.204 --> 31:48.538
(Announcer)
Gail's next attempt
at the beef...

31:48.605 --> 31:49.705
Gail...
Yes, Chef?

31:49.773 --> 31:50.840
Beef beautifully cooked.

31:50.908 --> 31:51.908
Thank you, Chef!

31:51.975 --> 31:53.109
(Announcer)
Is successful.

31:53.177 --> 31:54.744
Quick, quick.
Good.

31:54.811 --> 31:56.212
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, in
the blue kitchen...

31:56.280 --> 31:57.880
Up to the pass
with the halibut!

31:57.948 --> 31:59.715
(Announcer)
Raj is eager to finally
impress Chef Ramsey.

31:59.783 --> 32:01.784
Sorry about the delay.
Let's go.

32:01.852 --> 32:03.586
Yee yoo! Ha!

32:03.654 --> 32:05.288
(Announcer)
Maybe a little too eager.

32:05.355 --> 32:06.622
How many have you cooked?

32:06.690 --> 32:08.357
<i>One, two, three.</i>

32:08.425 --> 32:09.392
Oh, my God.

32:09.459 --> 32:11.060
When I get busy,

32:11.128 --> 32:13.496
I just start firing everything.

32:13.564 --> 32:15.231
So when they need it,
I got it.

32:15.299 --> 32:16.399
What are you doing,
playing the odds?

32:16.466 --> 32:18.234
Ma be good
out of three?

32:18.302 --> 32:19.902
But this is Chef Ramsey's
kitchen.

32:19.970 --> 32:21.537
You can't do that.

32:21.605 --> 32:24.307
Why would I try to fire
three tables?

32:24.374 --> 32:26.142
Uh, uh, yes, um...

32:27.678 --> 32:28.878
Donkey.

32:28.946 --> 32:32.615
Dude, you can't
serve this to anybody.

32:32.683 --> 32:34.250
(Vinny)
Raj cooks three Dover soles

32:34.318 --> 32:37.353
before they were even remotely
close to needing them.

32:37.421 --> 32:39.722
Sole special!

32:39.790 --> 32:42.358
<i>Chef, we ran out</i>
<i>of the sole special.</i>

32:42.426 --> 32:44.527
What?

32:44.595 --> 32:47.597
I've got three on order!

32:49.066 --> 32:50.533
We ran out of Dover soul.

32:50.601 --> 32:53.202
Oh, man, this is gonna
be real ugly.

32:53.270 --> 32:54.904
Oh, no.

32:54.972 --> 32:56.172
This sucks.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.208
Embarrassing [Bleep].

32:59.276 --> 33:00.977
(Raj)
It's a very bad situation.

33:01.044 --> 33:02.845
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

33:02.913 --> 33:04.880
I think we have to figure
something out quickly.

33:14.240 --> 33:18.043
(Announcer)
Thanks to Raj, the blue team
has run out of Dover sole.

33:18.110 --> 33:20.412
I've got three on order!

33:20.479 --> 33:23.348
(Announcer)
And Chef Ramsey has run out
of patience.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.450
Get out there and tell them
you're dragging two!

33:25.518 --> 33:27.185
And you go to the customers
and tell them

33:27.253 --> 33:28.687
you [Bleep]Ed it up.

33:28.754 --> 33:30.622
I didn't--
I need another jacket, though.

33:30.690 --> 33:32.390
I can't go out there
with this jacket.

33:32.458 --> 33:33.692
All right, come here.
Come here, you.

33:33.759 --> 33:34.759
<i>If you tell you</i>
<i>to get out there,</i>

33:34.827 --> 33:35.594
I don't give a [Bleep]
If you got

33:35.661 --> 33:36.161
a thong up your fat crack.

33:36.229 --> 33:37.462
Get out there!

33:40.833 --> 33:42.767
Hey, listen, [Bleep] Off
out there, will you?

33:42.835 --> 33:44.603
[Screaming]
Put it down

33:44.670 --> 33:45.971
and get out there!

33:48.274 --> 33:49.541
Couple of things
are going on in my head.

33:49.609 --> 33:50.642
Hi, my name's Raj.

33:50.710 --> 33:52.611
<i>How's it going back there?</i>

33:52.678 --> 33:54.079
My God, look at this.

33:54.146 --> 33:55.146
I'm a star.

33:55.214 --> 33:56.514
I'm terribly sorry,

33:56.582 --> 33:59.017
but we ran out
of the sole specials.

33:59.085 --> 34:01.653
Then the next thing you know,
look at this, I'm an idiot.

34:01.721 --> 34:03.521
So it's this elation,

34:03.589 --> 34:05.257
and then this--
this "degration."

34:05.324 --> 34:06.591
All at the same time.

34:06.659 --> 34:10.495
We have other
nice fish, though.

34:10.563 --> 34:11.096
(Announcer)
With Raj in the dining room...

34:11.163 --> 34:13.063
, Chef.

34:13.132 --> 34:14.666
(Announcer)
The blue team
is pushing out entrees.

34:14.734 --> 34:16.268
Service, please.
Good.

34:16.335 --> 34:18.402
Moving Raj completely
out of the kitchen

34:18.471 --> 34:19.971
made things run
er.

34:20.039 --> 34:21.206
I'm working it.
Okay.

34:21.274 --> 34:22.974
This is the first time
the blue team

34:23.042 --> 34:23.875
<i>is sounding like a team!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

34:23.943 --> 34:25.443
Last ticket, ladies!

34:25.511 --> 34:26.478
<i>Let's go,</i>
<i>keep it moving, guys.</i>

34:26.545 --> 34:27.779
Don't stop moving.

34:27.847 --> 34:29.313
Right behind you.
Right behind you.

34:29.382 --> 34:30.614
, the girls are plating
their last table.

34:30.683 --> 34:31.616
Go.

34:31.684 --> 34:32.650
Hallelujah.

34:32.717 --> 34:34.252
Good. Clear down.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.286
(All)
Yes, Chef.

34:35.353 --> 34:37.554
Go, John, please.

34:37.623 --> 34:39.623
Switch off.

34:39.692 --> 34:40.824
[Bleep] Me.
What a night.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.297
Oh, dear.

34:45.364 --> 34:46.965
<i>Tonight, we did</i>
<i>complete the service.</i>

34:47.033 --> 34:48.867
My God.
That was painful.

34:48.934 --> 34:51.335
It's pretty obvious I can't
pick a winning team.

34:51.404 --> 34:52.971
It's impossible.

34:53.039 --> 34:55.239
So I'm gonna revert to
the customers' comment cards.

34:55.308 --> 34:58.176
Because I need to at they'r.

34:58.244 --> 35:00.445
<i>Men...Your diners,</i>

35:00.513 --> 35:02.514
they loved the food.

35:02.581 --> 35:04.716
But they hated the wait.

35:04.784 --> 35:05.884
The percentage

35:05.951 --> 35:07.552
<i>of customers</i>

35:07.620 --> 35:08.953
that rated their experience

35:09.021 --> 35:11.323
<i>above average was...</i>

35:11.390 --> 35:17.595
54%.

35:17.663 --> 35:19.564
Ladies...

35:19.632 --> 35:21.800
<i>Your percentage of diners</i>
<i>that found</i>

35:21.867 --> 35:26.805
the overall dining experience
above average...

35:26.872 --> 35:30.141
50%.

35:30.209 --> 35:31.343
Yeah.

35:31.410 --> 35:33.478
So...You lost.

35:33.546 --> 35:35.647
<i>Ladies, go back</i>
<i>to the dorm.</i>

35:35.715 --> 35:37.916
<i>And think of two individuals</i>

35:37.983 --> 35:40.352
<i>who you don't want</i>
<i>any longer on your team.</i>

35:40.419 --> 35:41.419
Now [Bleep] Off.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.121
(Women)
Yes, Chef.

35:43.189 --> 35:44.823
(Jillian)
It sucks we lost.

35:44.890 --> 35:46.658
But now, I want to get rid
of the people

35:46.726 --> 35:48.193
who haven't done anything.

35:48.260 --> 35:49.227
Who aren't an asset
to the team.

35:49.295 --> 35:50.695
Who do you vote for?

35:50.763 --> 35:52.897
I would definitely have
to vote for Emily.

35:52.965 --> 35:54.299
Emily has sucked
at everything she's done

35:54.367 --> 35:55.533
since she got here.

35:55.601 --> 35:57.635
I'm putting Emily up.

35:57.703 --> 35:59.037
<i>Nona...</i>

35:59.105 --> 36:01.072
One of my votes will definitely
be for Emily.

36:01.140 --> 36:02.407
<i>Emily.</i>

36:02.475 --> 36:04.409
That's my vote.

36:04.477 --> 36:05.543
I'm not ready to go home.

36:05.611 --> 36:06.878
I deserve to be here

36:06.946 --> 36:08.980
and I want another day
in the kitchen.

36:09.048 --> 36:11.383
<i>Okay, so we know</i>
<i>emily's going up, yes?</i>

36:11.450 --> 36:13.151
(All)
Yes.

36:13.219 --> 36:14.986
So we just need
one more person to go up.

36:15.054 --> 36:16.121
<i>I'd vote for you,</i>
<i>melissa.</i>

36:16.188 --> 36:17.689
You're afraid.

36:19.325 --> 36:20.492
<i>It's like</i>
<i>you're afraid to do it.</i>

36:20.559 --> 36:21.926
Melissa should be up
for a nomination.

36:21.994 --> 36:23.728
She [Bleep] Up the fish station

36:23.796 --> 36:25.864
and just keeps failing.

36:25.931 --> 36:28.700
I guess that would have to be
my vote, for Melissa,

36:28.768 --> 36:30.335
if you base it
on overall performance.

36:30.403 --> 36:32.237
But Melissa's
strong in prep.

36:32.304 --> 36:33.838
<i>I think Melissa's</i>
<i>got the goods.</i>

36:33.906 --> 36:35.473
There's no question
in my mind

36:35.541 --> 36:37.142
who's the asset to our team
and who's not.

36:37.209 --> 36:39.144
Based on prep,

36:39.211 --> 36:41.579
I'm gonna have
to put up Sabrina.

36:41.647 --> 36:43.181
(Sabrina)
Are you serious?

36:43.249 --> 36:44.983
I wasn't even in
the [Bleep] Kitchen.

36:45.050 --> 36:46.518
I was in the dining room.

36:46.585 --> 36:49.454
I would have to go
with Sabrina.

36:49.522 --> 36:51.823
I just think it's stupid
to base it off of prep.

36:51.891 --> 36:54.125
Does Chef Ramsey want
a prep cook?

36:54.193 --> 36:56.161
How is that gonna help out,
you know, La Market?

36:56.228 --> 36:58.263
Kitchen doesn't run
if there's no food to cook.

36:58.330 --> 37:00.498
Yeah, but he
have somebody else do that.

37:00.566 --> 37:01.766
Whatever.

37:01.834 --> 37:03.701
I think you guys
just vote for me

37:03.769 --> 37:05.103
because it's easier--
because I have an attitude,

37:05.171 --> 37:06.905
because I don't
step up and prep,

37:06.972 --> 37:07.839
because I've only been
doing this for six months.

37:07.907 --> 37:09.107
All these bitches,

37:09.175 --> 37:10.809
they don't know
what they're talking about.

37:10.876 --> 37:12.143
They singled me out.
They always do.

37:12.211 --> 37:15.180
Two are for you,
and two are for me.

37:15.247 --> 37:16.214
So now it's up to you.

37:19.351 --> 37:20.718
Gail, it's your vote.

37:20.786 --> 37:22.187
Gail, you gotta--
you gotta vote.

37:22.254 --> 37:23.254
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>who to vote for.</i>

37:23.322 --> 37:25.557
Um...

37:34.076 --> 37:36.578
(Announcer)
After a difficult
deliberation,

37:36.645 --> 37:38.580
the red team has finally
come up with two nominees

37:38.647 --> 37:39.814
for elimination.

37:39.882 --> 37:40.815
Jillian...

37:40.883 --> 37:41.783
Yes, Chef?

37:41.851 --> 37:43.351
First nominee and why.

37:43.419 --> 37:45.587
Our first nominee was...

37:47.289 --> 37:48.423
Emily.

37:48.490 --> 37:49.924
<i>Emily.</i>

37:49.992 --> 37:51.292
We all felt that
she's not really

37:51.360 --> 37:53.561
an asset to our team, Chef.

37:53.629 --> 37:55.830
Second nominee and why,
please.

37:55.898 --> 37:58.833
The rest of the team...

37:58.901 --> 38:00.268
They decided
to vote for saina.

38:02.404 --> 38:03.338
Why?

38:03.405 --> 38:04.572
I really don't know, Chef.

38:04.640 --> 38:05.506
I didn't vote for Sabrina.

38:05.574 --> 38:06.307
Who did you vote for?

38:06.375 --> 38:07.675
Melissa, Chef.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.611
<i>Melissa.</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

38:09.678 --> 38:12.013
Sabrina wasn't
anywhere near service.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.648
<i>Can someone give me</i>
<i>a little bit of</i>

38:13.716 --> 38:15.783
insight into why
she's nominated?

38:15.851 --> 38:17.719
We feel it's a mixture
of a weak link

38:17.786 --> 38:19.420
<i>and she does Jack [Bleep]</i>
<i>During prep.</i>

38:19.488 --> 38:21.456
<i>She doesn't</i>
<i>do her prep list.</i>

38:21.523 --> 38:23.091
I don't stay awake all night
writing a prep list

38:23.158 --> 38:24.759
<i>because I understand it.</i>

38:24.827 --> 38:26.327
I don't need to write it down,
make a list of it

38:26.395 --> 38:27.595
<i>every single day.</i>

38:27.663 --> 38:29.564
Because I get it.

38:29.632 --> 38:32.700
Okay, let's get it
out of the way.

38:35.905 --> 38:37.272
Okay, Emily.

38:37.339 --> 38:38.806
Yes, Chef.
<i>I look at you,</i>

38:38.874 --> 38:40.375
and it's like, "phfooh."
Blank.

38:42.211 --> 38:44.045
Why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:44.113 --> 38:45.280
Because I have the drive
to make it, Chef,

38:45.347 --> 38:46.447
and I'm willing to learn.

38:46.515 --> 38:49.317
And understanding criticisay .

38:49.385 --> 38:51.252
I don't think you've
got the stamina

38:51.320 --> 38:52.854
quired to make it.

38:52.922 --> 38:54.422
I think I do, Chef.

38:54.490 --> 38:56.557
<i>I'm ready to fight.</i>

38:56.625 --> 38:57.525
Ay yi yi.
Sabrina...

38:57.593 --> 38:58.927
Yes, Chef?

38:58.994 --> 39:00.461
Your team really
wants you up here, yeah?

39:02.097 --> 39:03.298
<i>Why should you stay</i>
<i>in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

39:03.299 --> 39:04.766
I don't think
that I shoul

39:04.833 --> 39:06.935
<i>i here.</i>
<i>Why should you stay</i>
<i>melissa should be here.</i>

39:07.002 --> 39:09.370
Who has been
consistently horrible?

39:09.438 --> 39:11.973
The executive Chef,
right there.

39:12.041 --> 39:13.675
Emily, yeah, she [Bleep] Up,
and she sucks,

39:13.742 --> 39:15.410
but at least, you know,

39:15.477 --> 39:18.680
she hasn't done as horribly
as Melissa.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.982
Take a big, deep breath.

39:21.050 --> 39:22.483
I wanna know
why you think

39:22.551 --> 39:23.184
you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen.

39:23.252 --> 39:24.452
<i>Yeah? You.</i>

39:24.520 --> 39:26.621
I'm here to learn,
and I'm here to grow.

39:26.689 --> 39:28.523
I have bigger balls
and more determination

39:28.590 --> 39:29.991
than any of these
[Bleep] Girls here!

39:30.059 --> 39:31.826
All of them
put together, Chef!

39:36.365 --> 39:38.399
Okay, this is a very
difficult decision.

39:39.868 --> 39:43.271
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

39:43.339 --> 39:44.973
Is...

39:47.509 --> 39:48.810
Raj.

39:53.549 --> 39:55.149
Get your ass over here.

39:55.217 --> 39:57.018
<i>You, big boy,</i>
<i>are out of your league.</i>

39:57.086 --> 39:58.252
[Snickers]

39:58.320 --> 39:59.487
<i>Big time.</i>

39:59.555 --> 40:00.555
<i>And I personally</i>

40:00.622 --> 40:02.256
can't go an inch further.

40:02.324 --> 40:04.058
Jacket.

40:10.933 --> 40:16.671
There's the door there,
big boy.

40:16.739 --> 40:18.773
I can't believe it.
It's just a shock.

40:18.841 --> 40:20.475
I didn't get along
with anybody.

40:20.542 --> 40:22.010
I didn't
get along with Chef Ramsey.

40:22.077 --> 40:23.011
I didn't get along
with Scott.

40:23.078 --> 40:25.013
I didn't like the menu.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.214
But it was
a great experience.

40:26.281 --> 40:27.248
I had a great time.

40:27.316 --> 40:28.683
I'm really glad I did it.

40:30.853 --> 40:31.753
Relieved?

40:31.820 --> 40:33.454
Hat was--

40:33.522 --> 40:35.323
that was like a reward, bro.
Thank you.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.425
<i>Sabrina, Emily...</i>

40:37.493 --> 40:39.027
<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>you're getting a gift.</i>

40:39.094 --> 40:40.328
Ladies, back in line.

40:43.999 --> 40:44.932
<i>The prize may be</i>

40:45.000 --> 40:46.134
La Market.

40:46.201 --> 40:47.802
<i>Honestly, right now,</i>

40:47.870 --> 40:48.936
<i>you're not fit</i>

40:49.004 --> 40:50.071
for a supermarket.

40:50.139 --> 40:51.539
<i>Let's get that right.</i>

40:51.607 --> 40:52.907
Get some sleep.

40:52.975 --> 40:54.442
Tomorrow's gonna be
a tough day.

40:54.510 --> 40:55.710
(All)
Yes, Chef.
Get out.

40:55.778 --> 40:57.345
(Trev)
Finally, finally...

40:57.413 --> 40:59.013
We got no more dead weight.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.615
The game has begun.

41:00.682 --> 41:02.250
The girls gotta watch out.

41:02.317 --> 41:04.685
I don't think
there's any stopping us.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.055
(Sabrina)
My goal from here on out
is to just continue to fight,

41:07.122 --> 41:09.390
so Chef Ramsey can see
that I can be the one

41:09.458 --> 41:11.459
to run La Market.

41:11.527 --> 41:12.493
Nothing's gonna stop me.

41:12.561 --> 41:14.262
[Sighs]

41:14.329 --> 41:16.130
When the going gets tough
in the kitchen,

41:16.198 --> 41:18.066
a Chef puts his head down
and cooks.

41:18.133 --> 41:21.369
All Raj wanted to do
was put his head in the freezer.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.804
And that's why his stay
in Hell's Kitchen

41:22.871 --> 41:24.739
was a short one.

41:28.610 --> 41:30.445
(announcer)
The winner of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

41:30.512 --> 41:31.979
will become head Chef
of the brand-new,

41:32.047 --> 41:33.648
multimillion dollar
restaurant,

41:33.715 --> 41:35.650
La Market
in downtown Los Angeles.

41:35.717 --> 41:39.921
The salary, $1/4 million.

41:39.988 --> 41:42.190
(Announcer)
And they will also
tour the country

41:42.257 --> 41:43.891
as the official spokesperson
of rosemount estate winery.

41:43.959 --> 41:47.195
Next time, on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:47.262 --> 41:48.796
There's the door there,
big boy.

41:48.864 --> 41:50.431
(Announcer)
Raj may be gone...

41:50.499 --> 41:52.333
To a new beginning.
To a fantastic ending.

41:52.401 --> 41:54.102
(Announcer)
But the blue team
wastes no time

41:54.169 --> 41:56.170
finding a new scapegoat.

41:56.238 --> 41:59.140
Trev, he's not a Chef.
He's a tool to be used.

41:59.208 --> 42:00.808
Pull my butter.
<i>Give me a little squirt.</i>

42:00.876 --> 42:01.976
More, more,
more, more, more.

42:02.044 --> 42:03.177
Bitch.
Turn on the fryer.

42:03.245 --> 42:05.513
I'm done with these guys.

42:05.581 --> 42:07.915
(Announcer)
The red team has the mother
of all meltdowns.

42:07.983 --> 42:09.517
I don't give a [Bleep]!

42:09.585 --> 42:11.119
Calm down your little
ghetto attitude!

42:11.186 --> 42:13.054
You aren't doing
better than me at all!

42:13.122 --> 42:14.722
Shut the [Bleep] Up!
No!

42:14.790 --> 42:16.958
We don't want Sabrina
on the team anymore.

42:17.025 --> 42:18.993
(Announcer)
Sabrina takes revenge
in the kitchen...

42:19.061 --> 42:21.028
I'm one manipulative bitch.

42:21.096 --> 42:22.763
I'm starting
my spaghetti, Sabrina.

42:22.831 --> 42:24.298
I'm ready to walk!
I'm ready to walk!

42:24.366 --> 42:25.900
(Gordon)
Sabrina, it's cooked perfectly.

42:25.968 --> 42:27.635
Gail, where's
the two spaghetti?

42:27.703 --> 42:29.570
Ha ha ha ha ha.

42:29.638 --> 42:31.572
(Announcer)
And when Chef Ramsey
discovers her plan...

42:31.640 --> 42:34.442
Sabrina, youating me
like a [Bleep] Idiot.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.244
(Announcer)
He punishes everyone.

42:36.311 --> 42:37.845
I'm trying to [Bleep]
Run a restaurant!

42:37.913 --> 42:39.113
All of you!
Get it right!

42:39.181 --> 42:40.414
Gordon Ramsey lost his mind.

42:40.482 --> 42:42.083
I've had enough!

42:42.151 --> 42:44.051
No! No! No!

42:44.119 --> 42:46.320
What the hell
is that about?

42:46.388 --> 42:49.457
(Announcer)
But that's nothing compa what.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.058
I'm gonna make their lives
in Hell's Kitchen

42:51.126 --> 42:53.895
literally hell.
