I mean, this… This… This is fantastic.

13:10.740 --> 13:12.200
Because he can't fly.

13:14.370 --> 13:15.250
Yay.

13:18.170 --> 13:19.380
Okay, wait.

13:19.460 --> 13:23.090
You're disappointed because
you think angels are better than humans.

13:23.710 --> 13:24.630
Don't you?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.800
Well, yes, Linda. We are better.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.300
We can fly. We live forever.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.180
There's our superhuman strength.

13:41.110 --> 13:44.320
I… probably shouldn't have done that.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.570
[metal creaking]

13:50.240 --> 13:51.990
I'll have Maze take a look at that.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.450
Did I mention that we can fly?

13:55.580 --> 13:59.000
[clears throat] I mean,
no offense, Linda, but we are better.

14:00.460 --> 14:04.380
Okay. Um, offense taken, Amenadiel.

14:05.460 --> 14:06.380
You know what?

14:07.090 --> 14:10.300
Why don't you
fly this bag of shit to the trash

14:10.390 --> 14:13.680
while Charlie and I
go on a lame human walk?

14:14.930 --> 14:18.770
"You ruined my life, and I'm gonna make
sure you never ref another game again.

14:18.850 --> 14:21.860
The world would be a better place
if you would just drop dead."

14:21.940 --> 14:22.770
Subtle.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.280
This email came from your account, JJ.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.320
So?

14:26.400 --> 14:29.990
So it sounds like your son threatened
to kill the referee who is now dead.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.870
Surely, you see
where we're going with this.

14:31.950 --> 14:34.660
So you're a linebacker
for the Mulholland High Saints?

14:35.240 --> 14:38.540
And until last week's
playoff loss to the Wildcats,

14:38.620 --> 14:41.130
you had a full scholarship
to SMU on the table?

14:41.210 --> 14:42.790
You mean until the ref made

14:42.880 --> 14:46.460
the most asinine call in
the history of high school football? Yes.

14:48.340 --> 14:51.430
So you blame Steve Rockwell
for the loss of your scholarship?

14:52.010 --> 14:55.850
Of course it's Rockwell's fault.
He's a stupid ref who made a stupid call.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.890
He ruined everything for us.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.730
Don't you mean ruined
everything for him? [chuckles]

15:00.810 --> 15:03.610
JJ, do you even want to be an LB at SMU?

15:03.690 --> 15:06.780
I mean, it's a lot of acronyms
to keep track of, for starters.

15:07.610 --> 15:10.780
He doesn't know what he wants. He's 17.

15:10.860 --> 15:13.200
That's why I'm here,
helping him, guiding him.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.370
Watching him.

-Mm.

17:56.150 --> 17:57.740
I wanna be a pastry chef.

-[Chloe] Hmm.
-But you can't hold me.

You don't have any evidence that
I killed anyone. You wanna know why?

Because I didn't. JJ, let's go.

Um… I'd like to say something.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.480

-[Chloe] Excuse me.

18:31.230 --> 18:32.060
Go ahead.

18:32.150 --> 18:36.070
I saw Mr. Rockwell arguing with some dude
in the parking lot a couple of days ago.

18:36.150 --> 18:36.990
Mm-hmm.

18:37.070 --> 18:39.280
I didn't recognize the guy,
but it looked intense.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.320
Can you describe him?

18:40.410 --> 18:44.330
Not really. Uh, tall,
he was wearing, like, a ball cap.

18:45.370 --> 18:48.500
No, but he got into, like,
this really old-school yellow truck.

18:49.040 --> 18:49.920
Does that help?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.750
Yes. Yes, it does, thank you, JJ.

18:55.550 --> 18:58.130
Maybe you should join the CIA.

18:58.220 --> 19:02.010
-You're a really good spy.
-You really should start listening to him.

-You thought your Dad was here?
-He was, but he seems to have vanished.

[sighs] Well, at least
JJ's mom is clearly guilty as sin.

19:17.900 --> 19:22.740
We-- not exactly. No confession,
no hard evidence. We can't hold her.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.240
My gut says that
she's innocent anyhow, so…

19:26.490 --> 19:30.370
Even if she didn't kill the ref,
that woman is far from innocent.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.210
Poor JJ is permanently screwed,

19:33.290 --> 19:37.380

of his overbearing, judgmental mother.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.380

to live like a normal person,

-Yeah.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.220
I feel… for him.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.810
Best thing for JJ is
to sever all ties with the tyrant,

19:49.890 --> 19:51.600
get as far away from her as possible.

19:51.690 --> 19:56.690
Or maybe he could keep his parent close

19:56.770 --> 19:59.280
so that they could
work through their issues.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.990
Rebuild their broken relationship

20:03.070 --> 20:05.820
so that he might let go
of his anger and resentment and…

20:08.080 --> 20:09.490
live a normal life.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.660
And have normal,
loving relationships. Yeah.

That's gross. I got you your own.

20:35.020 --> 20:37.110
What exactly is this about, son?

20:38.150 --> 20:41.570
Well, remember that thing
that I said about staying away

20:41.650 --> 20:43.530
-from me for all eternity?
-Mm-hmm.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.410
I take it back.

20:45.490 --> 20:49.410
I think it's time that
you and I worked on our relationship

20:49.490 --> 20:52.290
so that I may have a relationship.

20:52.370 --> 20:53.290
Ergo…

-Mm-hmm.

21:21.070 --> 21:23.570

with the little cereal bits on top.

[sighing] Whoa.

26:18.820 --> 26:20.450
Okay. Harley.

26:21.950 --> 26:23.330
[Chloe] Hi.

26:23.410 --> 26:25.750
Oh. Hi. Hey.

26:26.330 --> 26:28.870
Uh, did you, uh, find a yellow truck?

26:29.460 --> 26:32.130
Uh, not yet, but, um, you okay?

26:32.210 --> 26:35.090
Oh, yeah, I just got
a couple of reports back from the lab.

26:35.170 --> 26:36.720
You know how excited I get.

26:36.800 --> 26:40.430
First, identified the poison.
Components aren't easy to come by.

26:40.510 --> 26:43.850
You gotta order them through hospitals,
chemistry labs, places like that.

26:43.930 --> 26:46.890
Right, so not exactly a lead,
but could help narrow things later.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.190
No, here is the juicy one.

26:50.270 --> 26:51.610
Other than the victim's,

26:51.690 --> 26:54.820
we found two other people's
fingerprints on Rockwell's whistle.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.070
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

26:56.150 --> 26:59.400
-So, anything from AFIS?
-Nope. But I did get a hit on EDS.

26:59.490 --> 27:02.030
Educational Database. What, a teacher?

27:02.120 --> 27:03.580
Nope again. A coach.

27:03.660 --> 27:06.160
And here is the juicy juice.

27:06.660 --> 27:10.290
He drives an old-school yellow truck.

27:10.370 --> 27:11.710
Really?

27:11.790 --> 27:15.460
So, uh, Dale McVey,
the coach for Benedict Canyon Wildcats.

27:15.550 --> 27:19.090
But doesn't make sense that he'd wanna
hurt Rockwell, because his bad call

27:19.170 --> 27:20.300
made the Wildcats win.

27:20.380 --> 27:21.340
Right, but--

27:21.430 --> 27:24.680
[Lucifer] Dad! What are you doing?
You're embarrassing me.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.810
[God] I didn't say
there was anything wrong with it.

27:26.890 --> 27:29.810
It's not what you're saying, Dad.
It's the way that you're saying it.

27:29.890 --> 27:32.270
-Hey, Lucifer.
-Hi.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.230
And hello again to you, sir.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.860
Good to see you two hanging out.

27:36.940 --> 27:39.650
-He doesn't like the coffee.
-I didn't say that. I didn't say anything.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.950
You spat it in the garbage.

27:42.030 --> 27:43.950
See, this is how
it's always been with him.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.910
A subtle raised eyebrow,
then straight to raining frogs. Here.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.660
Taste this, tell him it's delicious.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.950
Uh, not sure I should.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.870
Go ahead, child. Taste it.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.420
-It's fine.
-Of course it's fine.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.750
That's why I want her to taste it.
Taste it.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.170
-[Chloe] No--
-[Lucifer] Taste it!

27:57.250 --> 28:00.880
[whispers] I just don't think that
I should get in the middle of this.

28:01.510 --> 28:03.470
I would really prefer not to.

28:03.550 --> 28:05.640
So, good to see you. Excuse me.

28:05.720 --> 28:06.810
[grunts]

28:07.430 --> 28:09.970
-Now look what you did.
-[groans]

28:10.060 --> 28:11.350
-Come with me.
-[knocking]

28:12.940 --> 28:14.980
Ah! Taste this.

[both sighing]

28:26.240 --> 28:27.580
[sighs]

28:29.620 --> 28:30.870
[sighs]

28:33.210 --> 28:35.290
[Linda] I find these things are…

28:36.750 --> 28:38.750
usually never really about…

28:39.590 --> 28:40.880
the coffee.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.800
Perhaps you two could

28:42.880 --> 28:47.260
care to discuss what this is really about?

28:49.760 --> 28:51.730
Okay. Okay.

28:52.930 --> 28:55.560
Okay, he comes down here,
judging every little thing,

28:55.650 --> 28:58.060
which is ironic
because he made every little thing.

28:58.150 --> 29:02.110
Made all of us imperfect and then
criticizes us for not measuring up.

29:02.190 --> 29:06.660
So, photoshop your selfies,
prepare ye the way for Mr. Judgy-pants.

29:07.570 --> 29:11.790
Is this one of those times when
you say one thing and mean another?

29:11.870 --> 29:13.660
Because I certainly didn't invent that.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.170
If you're referring to sarcasm,

29:15.250 --> 29:18.080
I'm not smart-alecky
enough to take credit for that.

29:18.170 --> 29:20.840
Smart being in the title,
to which I'm sure you'll disagree.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.210
There it goes again.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.760
Okay. God, perhaps
we should start with you.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.720
Has Lucifer done
anything recently to anger you?

29:27.800 --> 29:30.050
[chuckles] Of course not.

29:30.140 --> 29:32.020
I'm not angry about anything.

29:32.100 --> 29:36.140
[chuckles] So, what? You just
banished me to Hell for shiggles?

29:36.230 --> 29:37.900
Be honest!

29:37.980 --> 29:40.980
You were pissed that
I threatened your superhero status

29:41.070 --> 29:42.690
and you were dying to punish me.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.190
You wanted me to suffer.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.740
-It's impossible to make him happy.
-[laughs]

29:46.820 --> 29:49.820
If I give my opinion, I'm controlling.

29:49.910 --> 29:52.870
If I stand back
and let him make his own decisions,

29:52.950 --> 29:55.750
I'm the distant father
with the "mysterious ways."

29:55.830 --> 29:59.170
Whatever I do,
he assumes the worst possible intentions.

29:59.250 --> 30:01.670
That's because nothing
is ever good enough for you.

30:01.750 --> 30:04.460
"Why don't you have a desk?
Why doesn't your car have a roof?"

30:04.550 --> 30:06.470
"Why's your kitchen
just a wall of Scotch?"

30:06.550 --> 30:09.430
I was merely trying
to take an interest in your life.

30:09.510 --> 30:12.560
He turned my crime scene
into a music video. [chuckles]

30:12.640 --> 30:18.100
And I do believe I detected
a certain baritone singing the loudest.

30:18.190 --> 30:21.520
It's baritone-tenor split, and
I can't help myself if the music starts.

30:21.610 --> 30:23.780
You know that,
and that's why you're doing it!

30:23.860 --> 30:25.860
-That's why you're doing it.
-Time out!

30:28.990 --> 30:30.200
Wanna know what I think?

30:30.280 --> 30:33.580
Oh, this is where the advice comes in,
so try to pay attention.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.870
I wouldn't want you
to "misinterpret" anything.

30:35.950 --> 30:38.960
You. You are an archangel.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.290
You're able to fly.

30:41.380 --> 30:42.710
Live forever.

30:42.790 --> 30:45.960
Coax the desires out of all humanity.

30:46.710 --> 30:47.550
Fly.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.050
And you…

30:50.010 --> 30:52.510
you are Almighty God.

30:52.600 --> 30:57.060
You are the most important being
in the entire universe.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.060
-You made the universe. You did that.
-[Lucifer scoffs]

31:01.150 --> 31:03.360
You've had millennia

31:03.440 --> 31:07.110
to evolve beyond all the petty squabbles
that we have down here on Earth.

31:07.190 --> 31:09.860
[chuckles] And yet, you haven't.

31:10.450 --> 31:12.910
You're basically
just like all of us. [chuckles]

31:12.990 --> 31:14.660
I mean, maybe even worse,

31:14.740 --> 31:18.580
if you consider all the time
that you've had to evolve…

31:18.660 --> 31:22.710
[laughs] …beyond all of this nonsense.

31:23.670 --> 31:26.170
I mean, take this father-son discord.

31:27.090 --> 31:30.720
So your son didn't turn out
exactly how you'd hoped.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.390
So he can't fly.

31:32.470 --> 31:34.720
I think we've
already established that I can fly.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.100
You know what a good father does?

31:37.180 --> 31:38.470
He loves his son.

31:39.390 --> 31:40.850
Unconditionally.

31:41.810 --> 31:44.560
Even if he doesn't have
a fancy pair of wings.

31:46.150 --> 31:47.570
No matter what.

31:49.190 --> 31:50.610
Supports him.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.070
You smell what I'm cooking?

31:54.740 --> 31:56.910
Uh, usually she's quite perceptive,

31:56.990 --> 31:59.870
but I suppose everyone
has an off day now and then.

32:02.290 --> 32:04.170
I believe I smell what you're cooking.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.920
In fact,
I think I know exactly what to do.

32:13.130 --> 32:14.930
Get ready to be supported, son.

32:16.260 --> 32:17.810
Okay.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.390
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

32:21.480 --> 32:24.940
Believe me, crabs are not a part
of humanity you want to experience.

32:25.020 --> 32:27.230
[chuckles] Whatever you say, son.

32:28.860 --> 32:31.530
[sniffs, groans]

32:31.610 --> 32:34.360
Excuse me, do you know
where we can find Coach McVey?

32:34.450 --> 32:37.740
-Should be here any minute.
-Great. Thank you so much.

32:40.580 --> 32:43.830
What a lovely, sweaty room
you've brought me to, Lucifer.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.540
-Are you two okay?
-Hmm.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.500
Couldn't be better.
I'm just happy to be here with my boy,

32:48.590 --> 32:51.840
having some affirming, receptive fun.
Speaking of…

32:52.920 --> 32:54.550
-Go deep, son.
-What?

32:56.760 --> 32:57.600
Nice…

32:58.760 --> 32:59.850
block! [chuckles]

33:00.520 --> 33:02.480
Please tell me you're Coach McVey.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.770
Can I help you?

33:03.850 --> 33:06.100
-Yes--
-[God] That's my son Lucifer.

33:06.190 --> 33:08.110
He's a very important assist--

33:08.190 --> 33:10.690
consultant for the police.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.490
Doesn't have a desk
because he likes to stay on the move.

33:14.570 --> 33:15.410
Right.

33:16.160 --> 33:20.280
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.
What can you tell us about Steve Rockwell?

33:20.790 --> 33:21.740
I'm sorry, who?

33:21.830 --> 33:25.290
Well, a witness said they saw you
arguing a few days before his death.

33:26.120 --> 33:30.460
-Oh, you mean "unnecessary ref-ness"?
-[Lucifer chuckles]

33:30.550 --> 33:34.510
Look, not to speak ill,
but that guy was a judgmental prick.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.010
Well, it's sort of
his job to pass judgment.

33:38.090 --> 33:40.850
Yeah, but he didn't have to be so
goddamned sanctimonious about it.

33:40.930 --> 33:42.770
Oh, please don't bring me into this.

33:42.850 --> 33:46.520
[sighs] Yes, it's not what they say.
It's the way they say it. Am I right?

33:46.600 --> 33:48.400
Wait, you're not here because you think

33:48.480 --> 33:50.570
I had anything to do
with what happened to the ref.

33:50.650 --> 33:52.190
I mean, I'm the last guy.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.610
That dumb-ass call
got us into the playoffs.

33:54.690 --> 33:57.490
Then why did we find your prints
on the poisoned whistle?

33:57.570 --> 33:58.410
[Lucifer] Hmm.

33:59.450 --> 34:01.660
Okay, maybe I need a lawyer.

34:01.740 --> 34:06.790
Or maybe you'd like to tell us
what it is that you truly desire.

34:07.750 --> 34:08.790
I…

34:10.080 --> 34:11.500
-I…
-Mm-hmm.

34:12.090 --> 34:14.550
I wanna be tackled
by a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader.

34:15.210 --> 34:18.260
The CIF championship
would get me to the university level.

34:18.340 --> 34:21.470
[sighs] And a few years of that,
I'd be doing pros in no time.

34:21.550 --> 34:24.600
-And by doing pros, I mean, well…
-[grunts]

34:24.680 --> 34:27.440
-You know what I mean. [laughs]
-Yes, I know what you mean.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.650
-Excellent use of your special talent.
-[sighs]

34:29.730 --> 34:32.110
One you can't take credit for,
might I remind you,

34:32.190 --> 34:34.360
since I know we self-actualize, so yay me.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.610
Hmm. Yes, of course.

34:35.690 --> 34:38.400
But technically,
I made you self-actualize,

34:38.490 --> 34:40.820
so, team effort. Up high!

34:41.620 --> 34:43.830
[Chloe] Anyhow, so I did some digging.

34:43.910 --> 34:46.580
The very same day
you were seen arguing with Rockwell,

34:46.660 --> 34:50.750
you made a big withdrawal
from your bank account. $5,000 in cash?

34:50.830 --> 34:53.960
Yes, perhaps you made a deal
with the referee to make a bad call

34:54.050 --> 34:55.590
and then decided not to pay up.

34:57.670 --> 34:58.510
Look…

34:59.430 --> 35:02.140
a week before the game,
I did offer him a payout,

35:02.220 --> 35:05.180
just to, like, you know,
nudge things my way.

35:05.260 --> 35:08.060
But Mr. High and Mighty…
[scoffs] He turned me down.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.940
Then we get to game time,

35:10.020 --> 35:12.730
and he actually does throw
a make-or-break in my favor.

35:12.810 --> 35:17.530
Worst call I've ever seen. So I figured
he was just posturing before.

35:17.610 --> 35:21.410
So I go to pay him off, he acts like
he doesn't know what I'm talking about.

35:21.490 --> 35:22.870
Threatens to turn me in.

35:22.950 --> 35:26.290
So you killed the pious bastard

Okay. You're not suggest--

Did Steve tell you
that he argued with Coach McVey?

I mean, he might have mentioned it, but
like I said, Steve had a lot of enemies.
