<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:08.354 --> 00:11.453
<i>Tesler continues to bring
peace and order to Argon.</i>

00:11.579 --> 00:13.467
Hey, you can't just take
my disc like that!

00:13.552 --> 00:15.605
Stand down.
Or you will be derezzed.

00:15.769 --> 00:19.631
<i>While Zed is preoccupied
with more important matters.</i>

00:19.632 --> 00:21.198
Hmm...

00:21.565 --> 00:24.219
<i>Page forms a taskforce
to hunt down Renegade.</i>

00:24.347 --> 00:26.621
We're here as representatives
of Tesler's army.

00:26.797 --> 00:30.032
<i>As Tesler's fondness for the
Renegade reaches new heights.</i>

00:30.497 --> 00:32.331
Seal the ship!

00:32.332 --> 00:34.166
<i>Stop him!!!</i>

01:04.297 --> 01:07.332
Help me, please!

01:09.335 --> 01:12.104
Help me, please!

01:15.175 --> 01:17.376
I'm reclaiming Argon.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.245
It's mine!
There's no going back!

01:28.321 --> 01:31.990
What will it take
to do away with you?

01:32.025 --> 01:34.359
No!

01:36.095 --> 01:40.032
<i>Do away with me?
You and what army?</i>

01:46.206 --> 01:49.174
Yeah... it's over, Renegade.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.984
Think again.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.222
It's only the beginning.

02:09.127 --> 02:12.965
<i>No! No!!!</i>

02:16.002 --> 02:19.739
<i>Now exiting slate mode.</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:23.141

<b>S01E08 - The Reward</b>

02:37.986 --> 02:40.853
Failure is no longer an option.

02:40.887 --> 02:45.958
I want the Renegade brought to
his knees, and I want it done now.

02:45.992 --> 02:48.761
- How can I help?
- You can't!

02:48.795 --> 02:51.764
This time I intend to play the odds.

02:51.798 --> 02:54.733
Let someone else flush
out the Renegade...

02:54.768 --> 02:57.069
Someone more attuned to the streets.

02:57.103 --> 03:00.072
I await your orders, your sagaciousness.

03:00.106 --> 03:01.840
Well, keep waiting!

03:01.875 --> 03:04.743
I am turning over the task
of catching the Renegade

03:04.778 --> 03:07.613
- to the programs of Argon.
- What?

03:07.647 --> 03:10.950
Get everybody to the Coliseum!
And I mean everybody!

03:13.687 --> 03:18.524
<i>You are here because
a terrorist lives among you.</i>

03:18.758 --> 03:23.796
<i>And your failure to identify him
makes you a complic in his crimes!</i>

03:23.830 --> 03:27.700
<i>But I offer you a chance for redemption.</i>

03:27.734 --> 03:30.769
Citizens of Argon,

03:30.804 --> 03:33.806
bring me the Renegade.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.975
<i>Of course, bringing him to justice</i>

03:36.009 --> 03:40.646
<i>is your civic duty and
should we reward enough,</i>

03:40.680 --> 03:43.582
<i>but since I always
put my programs first,</i>

03:43.617 --> 03:46.652
<i>I offer you this:</i>

03:46.686 --> 03:48.754
<i>The VL-1 Expressor,</i>

03:48.788 --> 03:51.790
<i>the only roadster to outrun a lightjet.</i>

03:51.825 --> 03:55.594
<i>Provide us with information
leading to the capture of the Renegade,</i>

03:55.629 --> 03:59.632
<i>and this remarkable
vehicle could be yours!</i>

03:59.666 --> 04:01.634
<i>And that's not all!</i>

04:01.668 --> 04:04.637
<i>To further our efforts of
achieving a Renegade-free Argon,</i>

04:04.671 --> 04:07.573
<i>the curfew is lifted.</i>

04:07.607 --> 04:11.844
Hey!
I've got your Renegade right here!

04:11.878 --> 04:15.881
<i>Congratulations, programs,
and happy hunting.</i>

04:18.752 --> 04:22.588
Wow. And then that happened.

04:22.622 --> 04:25.557
Nothing's changed.
If anything, we press harder.

04:25.592 --> 04:27.960
I'm sorry. Did you not see any of that?

04:27.994 --> 04:30.929
Everyone's looking to turn
me in and collect the reward.

04:30.964 --> 04:34.867
It's a desperate move on Tesler's part.
You can use it against him.

04:34.901 --> 04:37.803
No. I say we lay low for
a while. Take a break.

04:37.837 --> 04:40.572
- Beck.
- I don't have a choice.

04:40.607 --> 04:42.574
It's too dangerous.

04:42.609 --> 04:47.846
Okay.
Part of learning to lead a revolution

04:47.881 --> 04:50.015
is knowing when to
proceed and when to wait.

04:50.050 --> 04:53.852
- I'll defer to you on this one.
- Finally.

05:02.062 --> 05:05.764
- What... what's going on?
- Submit, program.

05:05.799 --> 05:07.966
- Who are you?!
- It's him! My neighbor!

05:08.001 --> 05:08.993
He's the Renegade!

05:08.994 --> 05:11.970
Based on the unbiased
testimony of your neighbor,

05:12.005 --> 05:14.740
you are hereby suspected
of being the Renegade.

05:14.774 --> 05:17.776
- I'm not the Renegade! I'm innocent!
- Put him with the others.

05:17.811 --> 05:21.580
<i>- I didn't do it!
- Over here!</i>

05:21.614 --> 05:23.916
It's him! The Renegade!

05:23.950 --> 05:25.784
- Come with us.
- It's not me!

05:25.819 --> 05:29.688
- It's not me!
- Keep moving.

05:29.723 --> 05:32.958
Sectors 3 through 5 reporting.
All suspects en route.

05:32.992 --> 05:34.827
That's it. Let's wrap it up.

05:34.861 --> 05:39.565
Yeah, great.
Ninety more Renegades to interrogate.

05:39.599 --> 05:43.001
- Just what we needed.
- Is that a complaint, soldier?

05:43.036 --> 05:46.705
If so, I'm sure the General would
be thrilled to hear your grievance.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.908
Uh, no. No, sir. Happy to serve.

05:49.943 --> 05:53.912
Back off, Pavel.
You hated Tesler's idea too.

05:53.947 --> 05:57.983
Oh, Paige.
You poor, deranged creature.

05:58.017 --> 06:00.052
The Renegade's changed everything.

06:00.086 --> 06:02.654
There's no going back
to the way things were.

06:02.689 --> 06:06.658
I'm telling you, if this works,
Tesler will make sweeping changes,

06:06.693 --> 06:09.628
and you and I will be
the first to be replaced.

06:09.662 --> 06:13.766
You're just being paranoid.
Come on, we're done.

06:25.645 --> 06:27.780
<i>No curfew? Please.</i>

06:27.814 --> 06:30.649
<i>Tesler's troops have
taken over everything.</i>

06:30.683 --> 06:32.951
<i>Told you so.
Been this way for a while now.</i>

06:32.986 --> 06:36.722
Of course, you'd know that if you
hung out with us like you used to.

06:36.756 --> 06:38.824
- Zed.
- It's okay, Mara.

06:38.858 --> 06:41.627
It doesn't matter. Not much
you could do about it anyway,

06:41.661 --> 06:43.562
it's all the Renegade's fault.

06:43.596 --> 06:48.767
- Unless you are the Renegade.
- Very funny. You got me.

06:48.802 --> 06:51.404
Please, please!
I don't want to spend

06:51.405 --> 06:54.006
the night talking about the Renegade.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.709
- I want to celebrate instead.
- I'm not the Renegade!

06:57.744 --> 07:00.104
Really? Doesn't seem like there's
much to celebrate anymore.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.649
How about the fact that we're finally
spending some free time together?

07:03.683 --> 07:08.821
Out on the town, with no curfew hanging
over our heads, just like old times.

07:09.956 --> 07:12.758
Yeah. Exactly like old times.

07:12.792 --> 07:15.794
But Mara's right.
We got the night off.

07:15.829 --> 07:18.564
Come on, zed.
Let's go have some fun.

07:18.598 --> 07:20.766
<i>You were kidding about
being the Renegade, right?</i>

07:32.912 --> 07:37.549
If you were mine, I'd
polish you every night.

07:37.584 --> 07:41.753
<i>What if I told you I could
make your dream a reality?</i>

07:41.788 --> 07:44.022
Commander Pavel, at your service.

07:45.625 --> 07:46.758
I don't get it.

07:46.793 --> 07:49.595
Why would you help me
win the roadster?

07:49.629 --> 07:51.830
Don't be so humble, citizen.

07:51.865 --> 07:55.601
In these trying times, Argon
needs a hero to look up to,

07:55.635 --> 07:58.604
someone who represents the population,

07:58.638 --> 08:01.807
Someone utterly
ordinary... like yourself.

08:01.841 --> 08:03.742
Thanks.

08:03.776 --> 08:07.713
I have information that will lead
to the capture of the Renegade.

08:07.747 --> 08:09.648
But I am hardly as ordinary as you.

08:09.682 --> 08:13.819
If I swoop in and claim the glory
that is rightly mine, who benefits?

08:13.853 --> 08:16.788
Well, then tell me, and I'll report it!

08:16.823 --> 08:20.726
Great minds think alike.

08:35.741 --> 08:38.977
<i>This can't be happening.
This was our place.</i>

08:44.951 --> 08:49.755
- Hey!
- You have a problem, program?

08:49.789 --> 08:51.857
No! No problem.
We're on our way out.

08:51.891 --> 08:54.760
- Don't come back.
- I won't.

08:54.794 --> 08:56.795
Beck, stop it.
What are you doing?

08:56.829 --> 08:58.697
You trying to get us sent to the games?

08:58.731 --> 09:02.834
Well, so much for old times.
I'm going home.

09:02.869 --> 09:04.803
No. I don't want to give up yet.

09:04.837 --> 09:08.774
Beck, Mara's right.
It's not the same anymore.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.584
See ya.

09:19.752 --> 09:21.820
Ow! Hey, what's going on?

09:21.854 --> 09:26.959
Based on the unbiased testimony
of this bold Argon patriot,

09:26.993 --> 09:30.696
you are hereby suspected
of being the Renegade!

09:31.965 --> 09:35.667
I knew it! That roadster
could have been mine!

09:35.702 --> 09:37.970
Submit, program.

09:46.413 --> 09:48.317
Come on!
You're making a mistake!

09:48.449 --> 09:51.434
<i>I'm not the Renegade!
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!</i>

09:51.571 --> 09:54.089
Yes, of course, exactly right.

09:54.217 --> 09:57.206
I'm sure the contents of your
disc will verify all of that.

09:57.403 --> 09:59.875
<i>Ha ha! Long live Clu!</i>

10:00.389 --> 10:03.007
Why could Link accuse
Hopper of being the Renegade?

10:03.136 --> 10:06.903
Hopper's not the Renegade. He's a
pain, but not that big of a pain.

10:07.048 --> 10:12.316
It's sick. All this reward has done
is turn programs against each other.

10:12.585 --> 10:14.999
I need to talk to Link and
get to the bottom of this.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.650
Good idea. Let's go.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.752
- No. You two stay here.
- But...

10:18.786 --> 10:21.221
Talk to Bartik.
He can't really believe his

10:21.222 --> 10:23.657
friend is the Renegade.
He must know more.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.993
Uh, Bartik and I don't
really see eye-to-eye.

10:27.028 --> 10:29.596
Fist-to-eye, maybe.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.599
- The fight... that's it!
- Huh? What?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.634
Beck, wait!

10:37.939 --> 10:39.940
Did I miss something?

10:39.974 --> 10:43.710
Pavel arrested Hopper!
He says he's the Renegade!

10:43.744 --> 10:48.849
- What are you talking about?
- I feel so... betrayed!

10:48.883 --> 10:51.918
I can't stay in here
any longer. I need air.

10:51.953 --> 10:55.055
- Bartik, wait!
- I need air!

10:55.089 --> 10:57.691
Who are you? What do you want?

10:57.725 --> 11:00.594
- Hopper's not the Renegade.
- And we can prove it.

11:07.702 --> 11:12.873
<i>Ninety more Renegades
to interrogate. Just what we need.</i>

11:15.877 --> 11:20.013
Gorn, did I mention I was in a hurry?
I'm in a hurry!!!

11:20.047 --> 11:24.317
I'm sure a wise program like
yourself understands that

11:24.318 --> 11:28.588
such dangerous work requires
great skill and patience.

11:28.623 --> 11:30.657
Blah blah blah.
Don't test me, Gorn.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.827
You'll be handsomely
rewarded... if it works!

11:33.861 --> 11:35.562
<i>N-n-n-ninety more...</i>

11:35.596 --> 11:37.998
<i>Ninety more Renegades to interrogate.</i>

11:42.770 --> 11:46.606
<i>Tesler, you're pathetic.
Come and get me.</i>

11:48.609 --> 11:49.843
Delicious.

11:49.877 --> 11:53.914
If Tesler wants a citizen
to do my job, then so be it!

11:53.948 --> 11:57.717
Now come! We have an
innocent life to ruin.

11:58.953 --> 12:01.955
This... is the Renegade?

12:04.825 --> 12:08.895
- One of our own?!
- Tragic, isn't it, sir?

12:08.930 --> 12:12.632
Clearly, he's a malicious malcontent
with only one purpose in mind...

12:12.667 --> 12:15.869
to see you choke
on your own iron fist.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.905
Speaking figuratively... sir.

12:18.940 --> 12:22.842
This program who turned
him in, this Lint...

12:22.877 --> 12:24.878
It's Link, sir.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.547
Right, Lint. Do you trust him?

12:27.581 --> 12:29.883
I do. He's a true hero of Argon,

12:29.917 --> 12:33.653
and I have to say, the
evidence speaks for itself.

12:41.996 --> 12:43.863
I'm free! Thank you!

12:43.898 --> 12:47.567
Tesler, you're pathetic.
Come and get me.

12:48.703 --> 12:50.570
<i>That's not me!</i>

12:52.640 --> 12:55.008
Please! I would never
say anything like that!

12:55.042 --> 12:56.977
I-I don't think you're pathetic at all!

12:57.011 --> 12:58.945
Stop your sniveling!

12:58.980 --> 13:01.304
I've spent far too many sleepless cycles

13:01.378 --> 13:04.684
imagining this moment
to have it end like this!

13:04.719 --> 13:10.590
I expected a far more worthy adversary.
But you're nothing but a coward!

13:11.859 --> 13:14.627
You're no Tron.

13:14.662 --> 13:16.663
Now take him away.

13:28.576 --> 13:31.574
Hey. Yeah.

13:32.713 --> 13:35.849
- Nice job catching the Renegade.
- Huh?!

13:37.918 --> 13:41.621
Don't hit me! It wasn't
my idea! It was...

13:43.958 --> 13:47.927
- Pavel.
- Paige!

13:47.962 --> 13:51.631
What an unwelcome and
completely predictable surprise.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.800
Spare me.
I know what you're up to.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.970
You're trying to embarrass
Tesler in front of Clu.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.772
Lies!

13:58.806 --> 14:01.708
You want him to arrest
the wrong program.

14:01.742 --> 14:05.612
You want him to appear incompetent
when dealing with the Renegade.

14:05.646 --> 14:08.481
And you want Clu to see
it and replace Tesler...

14:08.516 --> 14:11.751
- ...with you.
- Scintillating.

14:11.786 --> 14:16.556
I must admit, your incredibly vivid
imagination is quite entertaining.

14:16.590 --> 14:21.661
- Is it?
- Mechanics?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.763
You've arrested the wrong program.

14:23.798 --> 14:25.865
The night you fought the
Renegade in our garage,

14:25.900 --> 14:29.502
Hopper was there...
he couldn't possibly be the Renegade.

14:29.537 --> 14:31.938
Pavel, I had an idea
regarding the Renegade's exe...

14:34.008 --> 14:35.508
What's this?

14:35.543 --> 14:39.679
- Sir, these programs...
- Are Renegade sympathizers!

14:39.713 --> 14:40.847
Sympathizers?!

14:40.881 --> 14:44.851
That's not true!
General, allow me to explain.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.553
We're only trying to help!

14:46.587 --> 14:49.789
You've got the wrong program
in custody! He's innocent!

14:53.994 --> 14:56.529
You're questioning my judgment?

14:56.564 --> 15:00.600
- Sir, if I may speak on their behalf...
- You may not!

15:00.634 --> 15:02.954
Since you care so much about
my prisoner, you can join him!

15:02.970 --> 15:04.938
Guards, arrest these programs!

15:04.972 --> 15:09.576
I want them strung up!
Take them to Argon square, now.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.845
Just tell me one more time

15:11.879 --> 15:13.813
and I'll get it right,
no mistakes this time,

15:13.848 --> 15:17.917
I promise. Okay, for the
last time, the plan is this:

15:17.952 --> 15:20.050
You and your roadster
will appear at Hopperer's

15:20.062 --> 15:21.688
execution like they've
asked you to.

15:21.722 --> 15:24.691
But when I get there, you'll
pop up, Club me over the head,

15:24.725 --> 15:26.759
and reveal yourself
as the true Renegade.

15:26.794 --> 15:30.530
In front of everyone, proving
Hopper's innocence. Got it?

15:30.564 --> 15:33.766
Can we talk about the
clubbing-over-the-head part again?

15:33.801 --> 15:37.937
<i>Programs of Argon...</i>

15:37.972 --> 15:39.939
<i>your night I is over.</i>

15:39.974 --> 15:41.741
They've already started.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.015
<i>The Renegade has been unmasked!</i>

15:43.039 --> 15:44.944
Zed! Mara!

15:44.979 --> 15:48.982
<i>And the order that Clu
demands has been restored.</i>

15:49.016 --> 15:52.819
<i>We have won.</i>

15:52.853 --> 15:55.555
Let the public deresolutions begin.

15:58.759 --> 16:00.760
Does this mean we need a new plan?

16:03.764 --> 16:06.533
<i>Hey, wait! This is my new car!</i>

16:06.567 --> 16:09.702
Be careful!
Don't forget to use the blinkers!

16:28.930 --> 16:30.964
I'm innocent!

16:46.848 --> 16:49.233
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

16:49.234 --> 16:51.618
I don't have time for this.

16:56.791 --> 17:00.994
- Sir, I beg you. Please reconsider.
- Nonsense.

17:01.029 --> 17:04.631
Clu will be so proud of you General.

17:04.665 --> 17:07.601
Silence! Not another
word from either of you!

17:07.635 --> 17:09.837
I want to enjoy this.

17:31.893 --> 17:34.762
Good-bye, Renegade.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.546
Zed?

17:52.580 --> 17:54.948
It's gonnb be okay, Mara,
just close your eyes.

17:59.687 --> 18:03.557
- Tell me, is that...
- The Renegade?

18:05.794 --> 18:09.763
Zed, there's something I need
to say before it's too late.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.598
Okay. Tell me.

18:14.869 --> 18:17.938
You've always been a good friend
to me... the best, actually...

18:17.972 --> 18:21.546
but sometimes... I wish we...

18:22.844 --> 18:25.546
You wish we'd what?

18:26.915 --> 18:30.851
What are you waiting for?!
Stop him!

18:30.885 --> 18:32.820
Showtime.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.634
It's him! It's the Renegade!

18:51.873 --> 18:53.507
<i>This is fantastic!</i>

18:53.541 --> 18:56.844
Mara, as you were saying
just a moment ago...

19:11.726 --> 19:13.827
<i>Okay, Mara.
What were you about to say?</i>

19:19.767 --> 19:22.669
Mara, focus. Could have what?

19:39.954 --> 19:41.588
Sir, I...

19:41.623 --> 19:44.558
Don't ever bring this up again.

19:50.632 --> 19:52.966
I think we lost him.
Everybody okay?

19:54.736 --> 19:56.904
I'm alive!
The Renegade saved me!

19:56.938 --> 19:59.973
He... wait. The Renegade.

20:01.676 --> 20:03.677
You're the Renegade!

20:06.581 --> 20:08.517
Zed?

20:10.552 --> 20:13.887
Like I said, it's the only way
I can connect with these guys.

20:13.922 --> 20:17.891
Oh! This is incredible!

20:17.926 --> 20:22.529
- Thank you. You saved our lives.
- Yeah, thanks, I guess.

20:22.564 --> 20:24.965
Though this is sort of all
your fault to begin with.

20:24.999 --> 20:27.901
Zed, admit it.
You're enjoying yourself.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.536
- But...
- But nothing.

20:29.571 --> 20:33.874
We just outran a missile in
a stolen roadster with the Renegade.

20:33.908 --> 20:36.977
When's the last time we
had this much fun together?

20:37.011 --> 20:39.980
Yeah...
I just wish Beck were here.

20:41.014 --> 20:43.917
Beck. He would have loved this.

20:45.720 --> 20:50.624
This is where we part.
Remember, Tron lives.

21:02.937 --> 21:04.571
Whoa!

21:06.774 --> 21:10.711
Mara! About what you said
back on the platform...

21:10.745 --> 21:14.615
The... platform. What did I say?

21:14.649 --> 21:17.517
You said we... never mind.

21:26.728 --> 21:31.765
- I thought you were taking time off.
- Easier said than done, I guess.

21:32.782 --> 21:35.334
<i>Maybe another time.</i>
