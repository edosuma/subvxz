and want to see our boobs.

am I stars or stripes?

It's stripes and solids,
and you're stripes.

Oh. Okay.
It's just--

11:08.000 --> 11:11.203
When you hit it with the stick,
it's like miniature golf.

That's fun.

going to Morocco,

11:54.680 --> 11:56.082
giving up dairy.

I've learned that if I say no,
she digs in her heels,

11:59.151 --> 12:02.088
but if I give up
and say nothing,

12:02.088 --> 12:06.793
eventually she loses enthusiasm,
the idea flames out,

even before we've opened
the soy cheese.
