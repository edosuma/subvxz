WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.293
-Thursdays.
-Why the hell are you naked?

00:03.330 --> 00:06.390
It's after Labor Day!

00:06.440 --> 00:10.729
WOMAN (announcing):
Archer. All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.010 --> 00:15.332
FX presents The Americans.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.147
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:21.180 --> 00:23.045
Are you ready to move
to get the codes?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.512
ELIZABETH: Yes. I am.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.484
You know it's possible
for people like us

00:28.520 --> 00:32.490
who give everything
to our country and the world

00:32.530 --> 00:33.997
to forget ourselves.

00:34.030 --> 00:36.066
(voice breaking)
I'm gonna miss her.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.522
Before
we take the last step,

00:37.570 --> 00:39.891
I'll ask them to look for
another way In.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.761
Do you want me to ask?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.334
Yes.

00:44.370 --> 00:46.509
None of my business
anymore,

00:46.540 --> 00:49.270
but I can't stop thinking
about you and Burov.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.847
It might be that
you're holding off with Burov

00:51.880 --> 00:53.939
because your conscience
is bothering you,

00:53.980 --> 00:55.572
because of what happened
to Nina.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.087
What happened
to your old boss?

00:59.820 --> 01:02.357
Frank Gaad.
We have a proposal for you.

01:02.390 --> 01:04.119
(grunts)

01:04.160 --> 01:06.458
I'd like to sit down with you
and Elizabeth and Paige

01:06.500 --> 01:08.127
when I get back
from Ethiopia.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.127
Tim is missing.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.398
I made a tape.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.068
It says exactly who you are.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.796
If you have anything
to do with this...

01:14.840 --> 01:16.102
Paige, they're okay.

01:17.340 --> 01:20.138
I've never been
scared like that before.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.502
Please tell your parents
I'm sorry.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.113
(doorbell rings)

01:31.090 --> 01:33.058
Hi.

01:33.090 --> 01:35.650
Hi.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.658
Uh, am I
interrupting anything?

01:37.690 --> 01:40.818
No, no.
Come on in, please.

01:42.470 --> 01:46.167
It's so good
to have you home safe.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.929
-Oh, thanks.
-Can I get you something?

01:47.970 --> 01:49.961
No, uh, I'm fine.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.069
Pastor Tim.
Welcome back.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.078
Uh, you want coffee?

01:54.110 --> 01:56.374
Uh, no, thank you.

01:58.150 --> 02:00.618
Paige isn't here right now.
Um...

02:00.650 --> 02:02.789
Actually,
I came to see you.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.616
Is Henry...

02:08.660 --> 02:12.619
Uh, H-Henry's upstairs
in his room.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.962
I don't feel right
about what happened.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.639
That you felt threatened
for your safety

02:22.670 --> 02:25.161
because of something
that happened to me.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.977
It's okay.

02:29.010 --> 02:32.639
Alice was so afraid,
and...

02:32.680 --> 02:34.648
her reaction
was understandable.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.887
You're being generous.

02:41.420 --> 02:44.981
When I got lost
through my own stupidity...

02:47.060 --> 02:50.621
...I was terrified that
no one would ever find me.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.730
That I'd never
see Alice agaIn,

02:53.770 --> 02:56.898
see my baby born,
grow up.

03:02.180 --> 03:06.469
I thought about
you two and Paige.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.843
All the things that
being a parent can mean.

03:16.690 --> 03:19.557
Aanay. . .

03:19.600 --> 03:21.522
sorry for what happened.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.538
Well, that's it.

03:31.570 --> 03:34.698
That's what I came to say.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.901
Pastor Tim...

03:36.950 --> 03:40.772
W-Would you and Alice
like to come to dinner

03:40.820 --> 03:44.745
sometime later this week
or whenever IS good for you?

03:44.790 --> 03:48.783
P-Paige would love that,
and so would we.

03:48.820 --> 03:51.459
That -- That sounds great.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.629
I'll check with Alice,
if that's all right.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.127
Sure.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.468
Great.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.161
Great.

04:05.610 --> 04:08.829
(door opens, closes)

04:11.680 --> 04:14.843
**

04:57.630 --> 04:59.450
GABRIEL: In here.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.607
I made pierogi.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.608
Missing the 'old country'?

05:11.640 --> 05:15.178
(chuckles)

05:15.210 --> 05:19.840
My mother used to make them
for breakfast just like this.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.678
When we had eggs.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.483
No, thanks.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.818
The Centre turned down
your request.

05:35.860 --> 05:40.263
The mission with Don
and Young-Hee has to go forward.

05:45.570 --> 05:48.676
**

06:10.200 --> 06:11.599
(door opens)

06:11.630 --> 06:13.268
YOUNG-HEE: Okay, come on.
Come on, everybody.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.336
All right, Don,
we're leaving.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.463
(indistinct conversations)

06:31.590 --> 06:33.353
(car door closes)

06:33.390 --> 06:35.779
(engine starts)

07:01.180 --> 07:03.489
(doorbell rings)

07:09.990 --> 07:11.821
Patty.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.122
Where's Young-Hee?

07:16.160 --> 07:19.220
She's -- She took the kids
to school.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.965
Is anyone else here?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.763
No.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.765
Uh...

07:29.510 --> 07:31.944
Something --
Something wrong?

07:31.980 --> 07:33.971
(sighs)

07:37.150 --> 07:38.310
I'm pregnant.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.487
(scoffs)

07:44.530 --> 07:45.986
Well, say something.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.919
Uh,
h-how did this happen?

07:48.960 --> 07:52.896
It happened
because we had sex.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.999
(voice breaking) I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.803
(crying)

08:00.840 --> 08:02.876
What am I gonna do?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.584
You cannot have this baby.

08:11.250 --> 08:14.481
What do you mean?
I mean, what are you saying?

08:14.520 --> 08:16.556
That would
destroy everything.

08:16.590 --> 08:19.286
For you.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.820
(chuckles)

08:20.860 --> 08:22.498
And Young-Hee.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.798
So, you want me
to get rid of it?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.365
It's the only way.

08:39.350 --> 08:42.649
I-I will pay
for everything.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.318
I don't want your money.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.887
I don't want anything
from you.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.186
Don't worry, I won't upset
your perfect little life, okay?

08:53.860 --> 08:56.397
I'll take care of it myself.

08:58.970 --> 09:02.929
(door opens, closes)

09:22.490 --> 09:23.457
Thanks.

09:23.490 --> 09:24.980
Yeah.

09:26.490 --> 09:28.890
So, uh,
what's going on?

09:28.930 --> 09:31.922
(sighs)

09:31.970 --> 09:35.133
You remember my old boss,
Frank Gaad?

09:35.170 --> 09:37.968
You met him a couple years ago.
We had a barbecue.

09:38.010 --> 09:42.401
He and his wife went on a trip
to Asia -- Thailand.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.045
He was killed there.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.947
He wa-- He was killed?

09:49.250 --> 09:50.888
What -- What happened?

09:50.920 --> 09:54.117
They say it was a robbery
in his hotel room.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.926
But I don't buy it.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.724
I think
the Soviets did it.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.923
KGB.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.961
I don't know why exactly.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.763
He was out of the game.

10:07.800 --> 10:12.100
He couldn't do anything to them
anymore, but they...

10:12.140 --> 10:14.608
They're animals.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.801
You have no idea.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.738
I could tell you stories.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.238
I mean --
Well, I can't tell you.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.909
They're classified,
but trust me,

10:25.950 --> 10:28.487
they do things
you cannot imagine.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.149
(door opens)

10:36.830 --> 10:38.422
Oh, hey.
What's up?

10:38.470 --> 10:39.619
Hey.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.695
Just, uh,
chatting up my friend.

10:43.670 --> 10:45.604
You know,
I'm gonna head upstairs.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.777
It's been a long day.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.368
No, no.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.139
I'm headed out, so...

10:50.180 --> 10:51.340
It's good to see you.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.348
Yeah.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.848
Thanks for the drink.
-Yeah, of course.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.847
See ya.

10:56.890 --> 10:57.845
PHILIP: Good night.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.312
Bye.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.198
How'd it go?
You all right?

11:08.230 --> 11:11.461
I don't know.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.230
It's all yours now.
(sighs)

11:22.380 --> 11:24.177
(door opens)

11:24.210 --> 11:25.848
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.510
Did Stan drop off
any movies?

11:29.550 --> 11:31.643
Nope.

11:31.690 --> 11:32.486
Ugh. Damn.
What's for dinner?

11:32.520 --> 11:33.384
(chuckles)

11:33.420 --> 11:34.648
Grilled cheese sandwiches.

11:34.690 --> 11:36.055
Excellent.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.853
Hey, be back down
in 15 minutes, please.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.551
Hands washed.
-Okay.

11:39.590 --> 11:41.490
How did, uh --
How did youth group go?

11:41.530 --> 11:45.660
(sighs) We made a schedule
for the downtown food pantry.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.930
I'm gonna be working there
a couple nights a week.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.597
-Good.
-Great.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.164
Wheat or white?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.531
-White.
-Wheat for me.

12:06.990 --> 12:11.484
Stan's old boss, Frank Gaad,
was killed in Thailand.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.188
How?

12:14.230 --> 12:17.290
He was murdered
In hIS hotel room.

12:17.330 --> 12:23.007
Stan told me Gaad was
going to Thailand with his wife.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.128
When did he tell you that?

12:27.180 --> 12:30.069
A while ago.
We were playing racquetball.

12:30.110 --> 12:34.274
I put that in my report.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.276
Hmm.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.728
* Oh, sisters, let's go down

12:53.770 --> 12:57.001
* Let's go down, come on down

12:57.040 --> 13:00.100
* Oh, sisters, let's go down

13:00.140 --> 13:02.233
* Down to the river to pray

13:02.280 --> 13:03.770
Hi.

13:03.810 --> 13:07.143
I'm just here picking up Paige
from choir practice.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.614
I'm early,
or they're running late.

13:09.650 --> 13:12.118
Well, uh, come in.
Come in.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.694
We're so excited to have you
over for dinner, you and Alice.

13:21.730 --> 13:24.369
We're looking forward
to it.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.097
We got some strawberry ice cream
for dessert.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.803
Paige had mentioned that
that was Alice's favorite?

13:31.840 --> 13:33.637
It is.
(chuckles)

13:33.680 --> 13:35.307
Good.

13:39.710 --> 13:40.642
Is everything okay?

13:44.220 --> 13:46.085
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.649
It's all right.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.503
I think, you know...

14:15.280 --> 14:18.818
I think maybe Philip and I

14:18.850 --> 14:21.011
have just been under
a lot of pressure.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.851
(sighs)

14:25.890 --> 14:28.154
It's difficult.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.819
Well, it's just --
It's very hard.

14:32.870 --> 14:33.962
Um...

14:38.740 --> 14:41.436
You know, you are safe here,
Elizabeth.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.698
You can talk to me.

14:48.480 --> 14:53.281
I think
when Alice thought that

14:53.320 --> 14:56.619
we may have something to do with
your disappearance --

14:56.660 --> 14:58.787
which is not her fault.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.151
She was afraid,
and I understand that.

15:04.330 --> 15:08.790
I just really felt like
I was...

15:08.840 --> 15:11.161
coming apart.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.776
I understand.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.918
Do you?

15:23.620 --> 15:25.440
I think so.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.754
(footsteps approaching)

15:27.790 --> 15:29.087
(knock at door)

15:29.120 --> 15:30.553
Sorry.
Should I come back?

15:30.590 --> 15:32.729
I didn't mean_ to
take up your tIme.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.125
No.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.593
(chuckles)

15:55.220 --> 15:57.711
(Airplane passes overhead)

16:09.630 --> 16:11.996
You don't look so good.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.733
I'm tired.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.969
Not sleeping a lot.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.176
I keep thinking...

16:25.310 --> 16:27.972
You know what
I keep thinking about?

16:28.020 --> 16:29.317
You.

16:29.350 --> 16:32.217
I'm flattered.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.158
You're a smart guy,
Oleg.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.181
I don't think
you'd be too surprised to hear

16:39.230 --> 16:43.724
there's been a lot of interest
In you In our meetIngs.

16:43.770 --> 16:49.231
There's been talk about
blackmailing you.

16:49.270 --> 16:53.479
Talk about using Nina...

16:53.510 --> 16:57.970
or your brother.

16:58.010 --> 17:01.013
They want me to.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.329
You know, when I started
in counterintelligence,

17:12.360 --> 17:17.423
they gave me a new partner --
Chris Amador.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.825
You'd like the guy.

17:19.870 --> 17:21.337
Funny.

17:21.370 --> 17:24.009
Kind of direct, you know?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.531
Irreverent.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.505
I didn't even _realize how close
I was gettIng to the guy

17:29.540 --> 17:33.442
until you guys killed him.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.540
Anyone tell you
about that?

17:48.830 --> 17:51.628
I didn't know what to do.

17:53.470 --> 17:58.134
I think I kind of
lost my mind.

17:58.170 --> 18:01.708
I did something...

18:01.740 --> 18:03.241
terrible.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.840
Just as bad.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.982
I haven't felt the same
smce.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.127
What do you want me
to say?

18:22.660 --> 18:24.560
Right.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.693
What can you say?

18:29.840 --> 18:33.731
Amador, Nina.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.270
My old boss got killed.

18:35.310 --> 18:39.440
I think you guys
might've done it.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.814
Somewhere in there,
my wife left me.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.454
I don't want you
on my conscience, too.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.119
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.822
That's what
I wanted to say.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.854
(engine starts)

19:25.860 --> 19:29.296
(vehicle departs)

19:29.330 --> 19:30.763
(jazz music plays)

19:33.570 --> 19:34.696
Red or white?

19:34.740 --> 19:35.798
Red.

19:35.840 --> 19:36.864
Red for me, too.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.401
(chuckles)

19:50.020 --> 19:51.544
Do you always
cook dinner?

19:51.590 --> 19:53.319
I try to.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.850
I mean, everyone's busy.

19:54.890 --> 19:57.859
Things don't always
go according to plan.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.528
I hope you like lamb.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.222
Oh, I devour anything
put in front of me these days.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.898
I'm sure.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.758
Elizabeth.

20:09.800 --> 20:13.702
I didn't ask for this --
any of this.

20:13.740 --> 20:18.074
I'm not vindictive.
I don't threaten people.

20:18.110 --> 20:21.273
That isn't me.
It's not who I am.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.378
_ If I were_
In your SItuatIon,

20:26.420 --> 20:28.581
I probably would've
clone the same.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.383
(doorbell rings)

20:30.430 --> 20:33.593
Henry, can you
get that, please?

20:33.630 --> 20:35.450
Coming.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.149
Coming.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.789
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.967
-Something smells good.
-Yeah, Mom made lamb roast.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.602
-Who is it?
-Stan.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.738
STAN:
Oh, you got company?

20:51.780 --> 20:54.214
-Uh, yeah.
-Hey. What's up?

20:54.250 --> 20:55.877
Hey, I'm just dropping off
"Silver Streak."

20:55.920 --> 20:57.979
Cool.
It's a good one.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.612
Hey, why don't you
stay for dinner?

20:59.650 --> 21:02.778
We've got plenty,
and you can meet Pastor Tim.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.048
Mom,
Stan's staying for dinner.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.557
-Stan?
-Yeah.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.558
He's starving.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.454
I'll pull up a chair
next to me.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.467
Hey, look,
if it's a problem --

21:10.500 --> 21:11.660
No, no, no.

21:11.700 --> 21:12.792
There's plenty
to go around.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.161
-You sure_?
-Come on In.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.237
You got a pastor
in the house, huh?

21:17.270 --> 21:19.067
Wow.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.078
ELIZABETH:
Uh, hi, Stan.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.737
Hi. I didn't know
you had company.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.907
-Hi. I'm Tim.
-Stan Beeman.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.076
-Pleased to meet you.
-Likewise.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.145
Alice.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.068
Hi.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.578
Tim is Paige's pastor.
Our pastor.

21:32.620 --> 21:33.917
He baptized me.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.484
Wow.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.158
Alice is my wife.

21:37.190 --> 21:39.181
Oh, well, I see
Elizabeth's not the only one

21:39.230 --> 21:41.027
with a roast
In the oven.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.424
I live across the street.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.665
I-I tend to show up
around meal time.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.134
(chuckles)
Although I've never
crashed a party before.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.206
The more the merrier.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.299
Yeah, look, come on.
Pull up a chair.

21:54.340 --> 21:56.831
Stuff your face.
You sure?

21:56.880 --> 22:00.270
Absolutely.
There's plenty to go around.

22:00.310 --> 22:02.210
Okay.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.848
Yeah, we moved here
about three years ago.

22:08.890 --> 22:10.687
It's a great little
neighborhood.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.685
From where?

22:11.730 --> 22:13.527
-St. Louis.
-Mm.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.788
Is your family out of town?

22:14.830 --> 22:16.354
Oh, no,
my son's with my wife.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.698
And she's with her boyfriend.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.691
We're getting divorced.

22:22.740 --> 22:26.460
Mm.
That must be hard.

22:26.510 --> 22:29.638
It's getting better.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.001
Well, not better.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.915
Easier.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.818
Uh, so,
what do you do, Stan?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.452
Oh, he's an FBI agent.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.928
Really?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.825
Really.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.498
Huh.

22:51.530 --> 22:56.433
And you're a pastor
at the church Paige goes to?

22:56.470 --> 22:57.607
Iam.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.336
I know
it's been great for her.

23:00.370 --> 23:01.837
We believe in
soaal actIon

23:01.880 --> 23:02.938
and making the world
a better place.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.402
All for that.

23:04.450 --> 23:08.841
Yeah, Pastor Tim chained himself
to a fence once.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.610
It -- It was
a Ban the Bomb rally.

23:11.650 --> 23:13.618
Oh.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.185
We believe in
soaal justIce

23:16.220 --> 23:19.223
with a healthy dollop of Jesus
in the mix.

23:35.410 --> 23:38.675
**

24:04.310 --> 24:05.766
Can I help you?

24:05.810 --> 24:07.801
Yeah, we're here to see
Don Seong.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.001
Is he expecting you?

24:10.040 --> 24:12.076
No,
but he'll want to see us.

24:12.110 --> 24:14.271
Can I see
some identification?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.174
Of course.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.519
(coughing)

24:40.470 --> 24:44.349
Yes. I have a John, Leonard,
and Theresa Rawlings

24:44.380 --> 24:46.143
here to see you.
Yes.

24:49.420 --> 24:51.047
Have a seat.
He'll be right out.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.739
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.378
(coughs)

25:17.240 --> 25:18.844
How can I help you?

25:21.180 --> 25:23.011
We're Patty's family.

25:23.050 --> 25:26.042
We need to talk to you.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.066
They're with me.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.694
Okay. Here you go.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.701
Follow me.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.577
I'm, uh,
I'm Patty's brother.

26:25.610 --> 26:28.078
This is her father
and stepmother.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.616
Why did you come here?

26:36.260 --> 26:37.989
Patty's dead.

26:39.860 --> 26:41.953
Uh...

26:42.000 --> 26:44.969
That cannot be true.
I-I don't understand.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.024
She killed herself.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.168
She...

26:51.210 --> 26:52.461
She was --

26:52.510 --> 26:54.728
You knew
that she was pregnant.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.998
Y-Yes.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.576
You told her_
to get an abortIon.

26:58.610 --> 27:00.407
Yes, but I-I had
neverthought

27:00.450 --> 27:01.769
that she would hurt herself.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.139
You killed her.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.647
You killed my beautiful girl,
you bastard.

27:04.690 --> 27:07.682
I-I swear
I did not know about that.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.349
You're -- You're sorry?

27:11.390 --> 27:12.755
What? What --
What does that even me--

27:12.790 --> 27:15.020
My sister is dead!

27:15.060 --> 27:17.665
I -- P-Please,
do -- do not talk that loud.

27:17.700 --> 27:18.962
N-Not in here.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.024
You're a coward.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.129
(coughs)

27:22.170 --> 27:24.001
We want to take her home.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.103
We expect you to pay.

27:28.140 --> 27:32.304
For getting Patty to California
and the funeral expenses.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.614
Yes. Uh, I...

27:34.650 --> 27:37.517
will do that, of course.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.627
We --
We want the money now.

27:45.660 --> 27:49.027
I-I do not have] go much with me.

27:49.060 --> 27:53.190
We -- We can go to the bank,
and I will get that money out.

27:53.230 --> 27:54.561
Good.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.363
Because you disgust me,

27:56.400 --> 27:58.709
and I never want _to see
your face agaIn.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.537
He's weak, John.

28:00.570 --> 28:02.879
All right, okay.
Um, you -- you two stay here.

28:02.910 --> 28:05.674
I'm -- I'm sorry,
but I cannot let them do that.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.247
Look at him.

28:17.090 --> 28:18.682
Okay.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.874
**

29:08.240 --> 29:09.969
(computer beeps)

29:10.010 --> 29:12.342
(computer whirring)

29:24.990 --> 29:26.855
(keyboard clacking)

29:33.630 --> 29:35.632
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

29:35.670 --> 29:37.433
Uh, thanks for dinner
the other night.

29:37.470 --> 29:38.562
It was really nice.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.237
Yeah.
It was nice to have you.

29:40.270 --> 29:43.979
Um, interesting
to meet your neighbor.

29:44.010 --> 29:45.307
(chuckles)

29:45.350 --> 29:48.319
Stan. Yes.

29:48.350 --> 29:50.944
Yeah, I was surprised
to hear about his profession.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.811
Right.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.851
Well, can't choose
your neighbors.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.281
Can't you?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.327
We lived there first
for a long time.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.628
And you know...

30:10.670 --> 30:14.128
we didn't choose each other
either, did we?

30:16.840 --> 30:19.638
Honestly, I...
can only thank you

30:19.680 --> 30:21.216
for everything you've done
for Paige.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.483
When she first started
comIng here to church,

30:26.520 --> 30:29.683
I felt threatened.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.529
I was...

30:34.230 --> 30:35.993
I was afraid
I was gonna lose her.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.169
To God?

30:40.400 --> 30:41.992
And to you.

30:43.740 --> 30:45.662
But it didn't happen.

30:45.710 --> 30:49.134
In fact,
we've gotten closer,

30:49.180 --> 30:52.968
and things have been better.

30:53.010 --> 30:57.117
And there's nothing
that I did or Philip.

30:58.620 --> 30:59.985
It was you.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.580
Oh.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.656
You took a risk.

31:04.690 --> 31:07.227
You opened yourself up
to her.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.955
That took faith.

31:11.930 --> 31:12.999
In Paige.

31:13.030 --> 31:16.488
Okay.
(chuckles)

31:16.540 --> 31:20.863
Yeah, I...feel...

31:24.780 --> 31:26.270
What?

31:28.550 --> 31:31.519
Mm.

31:31.550 --> 31:34.280
That you're out on a limb
and you've handed me a saw.

31:34.320 --> 31:38.120
(chuckles)

31:40.060 --> 31:42.199
None of us
are In control.

31:42.230 --> 31:43.527
Not really.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.892
Not ever.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.391
_Because
we're In God's hands?

31:51.610 --> 31:53.976
I know
you don't see it that way,

31:54.010 --> 31:56.729
but there is
something greater than this.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.805
Hmm.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.579
How do you know?

32:00.610 --> 32:03.716
I don't know.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.342
I believe.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.155
That doesn't always work,

32:08.190 --> 32:12.422
but most of the time...
it makes things better.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.100
(door opens)

32:32.280 --> 32:34.316
You okay, Dad?

32:34.350 --> 32:35.772
Let's get him home.

32:35.820 --> 32:37.674
Sure.

32:39.120 --> 32:42.851
I know nobody can forgive
what I did.

32:42.890 --> 32:46.348
I'm ashamed and...

32:46.390 --> 32:47.994
very sorry.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.539
(door closes)

33:14.390 --> 33:16.608
Hey, Stan.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.457
One of the reports I put in
for follow up

33:18.490 --> 33:21.653
on the Martha investigation
came back with a curious detail.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.793
_ "Curious"
Is a curIous word.

33:23.830 --> 33:26.663
"When the door became stuck

33:26.700 --> 33:28.964
while attempting to
remove some files,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.309
Agent Gaad
pulled repeatedly."

33:31.340 --> 33:34.969
More like Gaad went batshit
on the mail robot.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.507
While it was being repaired,

33:38.550 --> 33:41.644
there was a 911 call
from the repair facility.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.888
Apparently,
there was a death there.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.047
VVho?

33:47.090 --> 33:48.557
The owner's mother.

33:48.590 --> 33:52.128
Now, the report says
natural causes.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.695
**

34:11.550 --> 34:14.041
He went for it.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.584
How is he?

34:19.620 --> 34:22.259
Scared, upset.

34:24.730 --> 34:29.690
We, uh -- We didn't find the
Level Four codes in his office.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.368
But...

34:31.400 --> 34:34.631
they copied
all of his computer discs,

34:34.670 --> 34:37.093
so hopefully they're there.

34:42.010 --> 34:44.808
You think
he'll tell Young-Hee?

34:44.850 --> 34:46.499
I don't think so.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.249
But it's hard
to really know.

34:53.290 --> 34:56.282
**

35:22.350 --> 35:23.476
(coin drops)

35:23.520 --> 35:26.080
(dialing)

35:26.120 --> 35:28.611
(telephone rings)

35:28.660 --> 35:29.649
JOAN: Hello?

35:29.690 --> 35:31.487
This is Mrs. Hathaway.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.827
Oh, hi.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.749
I have a message for you.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.654
(siren wailing in distance)

35:37.700 --> 35:39.292
YOUNG-HEE:
Patty, it's me.

35:39.330 --> 35:41.434
I need to talk to you.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.199
Where did you go?

35:43.240 --> 35:45.834
Why you don't call me?

35:45.870 --> 35:48.930
Something is not right
about Don.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.039
He's acting so...

35:52.050 --> 35:53.699
I need to talk to you.

35:53.750 --> 35:54.876
Please call b--

35:54.920 --> 35:56.876
(coin clatters)

35:56.920 --> 35:59.388
(dog barks in distance)

36:21.040 --> 36:23.736
(indistinct conversations)

36:31.250 --> 36:32.649
Hi.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.009
Elizabeth.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.684
I thought we were
driving Paige home in the van.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.324
Yeah,
it's not far from work for me,

36:41.360 --> 36:43.499
and I was on my way home,
so...

36:43.530 --> 36:44.895
Oh.

36:44.930 --> 36:46.329
Well, maybe you can come by
a bit earlier

36:46.370 --> 36:48.588
and help out a bit
next time.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.164
Maybe.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.428
(chuckles)

36:51.470 --> 36:53.700
I'll let her know
you're here.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.207
Okay.

37:00.710 --> 37:01.745
Pastor Tim.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.983
Um...you know, if...

37:09.820 --> 37:14.359
If you have something
on your mind and...

37:14.400 --> 37:17.358
you know, you can't stop
thinking about it --

37:17.400 --> 37:21.393
you want to,
but you -- you can't.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.634
Um...

37:22.670 --> 37:24.137
I pray.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.728
For guidance.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.741
What if you...

37:35.780 --> 37:40.149
What if you don't...
believe in God?

37:40.190 --> 37:42.909
Or religion or prayer?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.819
None of those things
matter.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.021
It doesn't matter?

37:52.200 --> 37:54.498
All that matters is
how we treat each other.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.783
Is this forever?

38:16.820 --> 38:19.459
With Pastor Tim
and Alice?

38:19.490 --> 38:21.958
I don't know yet.

38:25.530 --> 38:29.261
You know, Alice accused us
of something that we didn't do,

38:29.300 --> 38:33.464
so that works
to our advantage.

38:33.510 --> 38:36.604
How?

38:36.640 --> 38:37.777
Well, she feels bad.

38:37.810 --> 38:41.439
Pastor Tim
feels the same.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.471
You understand?

38:43.520 --> 38:45.841
You pretend
to forgive them.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.157
Your father and I
love you

38:51.190 --> 38:55.650
and will do anything
to keep this family together.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.863
And maybe
a difficult situation

38:58.900 --> 39:02.495
will get easier
for all of us,

39:02.540 --> 39:07.364
including
Pastor Tim and Alice.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.402
What about the tape?

39:12.580 --> 39:14.343
I don't know.

39:14.380 --> 39:16.143
But if it
makes them feel good

39:16.180 --> 39:19.183
knowing it's sitting in a safe
somewhere,

39:19.220 --> 39:21.882
maybe it's not
such a bad thing.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.681
Mom...

39:27.730 --> 39:30.858
Matthew told me something
last week,

39:30.900 --> 39:33.892
and I don't know
if it's...

39:33.930 --> 39:36.694
What?

39:36.740 --> 39:40.267
Well, he said his dad's
talking to him more,

39:40.310 --> 39:44.098
and he told him that he went out
with the father

39:44.140 --> 39:47.405
of one_ of the secretaries
In ms ofﬁce.

39:47.450 --> 39:49.315
The secretary was a spy.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.585
She just disappeared.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.713
I guess it was really hard
for Mr. Beeman

39:56.760 --> 39:58.648
to talk to her father.

40:01.830 --> 40:04.469
I-I just went over there
looking for Henry,

40:04.500 --> 40:08.163
and he -- he started
telling me this stuff.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.830
Can I drive? _
I need more practIce.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.707
That's Dad's job.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.446
It was worth a shot.

40:22.450 --> 40:24.077
Got a cigarette?

40:24.120 --> 40:26.680
No, we don't.

40:27.950 --> 40:30.987
There's, uh -- there's
a grocery store down there.

40:31.020 --> 40:33.818
(laughs)

40:33.860 --> 40:35.896
Hey, uh, guys,
we don't want any trouble.

40:35.930 --> 40:37.727
Why don't you just, uh, go ahead
and take that.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.263
(chuckles)

40:40.300 --> 40:42.097
How old are you?

40:44.340 --> 40:47.059
Don't be scared,
sweetheart.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.328
(grunts)

40:49.380 --> 40:50.404
(switchblade opens)

40:50.440 --> 40:51.543
No!

40:52.610 --> 40:54.840
(groaning)

40:56.020 --> 40:58.318
(whimpers)

40:58.350 --> 40:59.339
Paige!

40:59.390 --> 41:00.743
(coughing)

41:00.790 --> 41:03.350
Paige.

41:03.390 --> 41:06.052
(coughing)

41:13.070 --> 41:15.368
Let's go.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.630
Paige, now!

41:38.020 --> 41:41.080

42:18.060 --> 42:20.062

42:38.920 --> 42:41.388
-(silenced gunshot)
-(silenced gunshots)

42:41.420 --> 42:42.910

42:52.500 --> 42:54.058
ANNOUNCER:

43:32.170 --> 43:34.138
Johnny Rock's
Demon Rum and Cola.

43:34.170 --> 43:38.174
It comes in a cool bottle,
like black with a gold-flaked
skull and crossbones on it.

43:38.210 --> 43:40.440
We can jack up the price.
What do you think?

43:40.480 --> 43:42.141
I'm sober, dude.

43:42.180 --> 43:45.445
Dude, doesn't mean you can't
make money off drunk people.
