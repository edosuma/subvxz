00:38.872 --> 00:41.458
Hey, Fiona, is <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
offensive to witches?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.251
My parents were watching it last night.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.420
It was on that Witch Heritage Month
movie marathon.

00:45.503 --> 00:49.466
And when what's-her-name got melted
with water, I was like, "what?"

00:49.549 --> 00:52.385
I mean, I've seen Fiona wash her hands.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.304
Yeah, it's not exactly accurate.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.181
Like, does she never take a shower?

00:56.264 --> 00:57.640
And why'd they make her green?

00:57.724 --> 01:00.060
Well, maybe they were making a point
about the environment.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.395
-Mm-hm.
-Don't be stupid, Lianne. Come on.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.647
This is why you need
more representation in film.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.776
I mean, whatever. I don't really care.
I'm, like, barely a witch anyway.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.319
Hey, aren't you gonna eat?

01:09.778 --> 01:10.862
Not that hungry.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.078
So, are you guys around this weekend?

01:18.161 --> 01:21.372
Because I'm seriously failing chemistry,
and you're way better at it.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.875
Hard pass. You almost blew us
to smithereens last time.

01:23.958 --> 01:24.834
I did not!

01:24.918 --> 01:27.796
Lianne, did you or did you not
set my hair on fire?

01:39.974 --> 01:41.643
-You're blushing.
-What?

01:41.726 --> 01:42.644
I'm not.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.562
You've been crushing
on Emilio for forever.

01:44.646 --> 01:45.897
Just ask him to the dance.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.981
I don't know.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.274
Come on, just live a little.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.609
Lianne, please.

01:49.692 --> 01:50.652
Live a little.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.864
Besides, the dance is for everybody,

01:54.948 --> 01:57.075
not just for people
who peak in high school.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.409
I heard that, Gemma.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.869
I know you did, Madison.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.871
I also heard you talking about Emilio.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.874
Thing is, is he's already going
to the dance with me.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.793
Try not to cry.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.170
Oh, wait, can witches even cry?

02:09.254 --> 02:10.964
Oh, yeah, I've seen Fiona cry
lots of times.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.006
Thank you, Lianne.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.802
Nice hairy wart, by the way.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.266
I don't know what Emilio sees in her.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.226
Perfect features and smooth skin?

02:24.644 --> 02:26.604
I, uh, I gotta go.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.023
Perfect features?

02:29.107 --> 02:31.484
-But it's true. I just--
-Are you dehydrated? Come on.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.931
-I recommend the extra credit.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.642
Some of you need the points.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.023
Fiona. Everything all right?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.525
Yeah. I, um...

03:12.609 --> 03:17.864
Uh, I was just wondering if maybe
I could do my report on someone else?

03:17.947 --> 03:20.575
But I chose your great-aunt
especially for you.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.119
It'll be exciting to dig up
your family history.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.996
Maybe you can even find out
what she was like.

03:25.079 --> 03:29.751
Just imagine,
to be a witch in the colonial era.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.047
Yeah, thing is, she's still alive.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.299
-Oh.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.467
Still in Salem, actually.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.844
Yeah, she owns a cupcake shop.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.680
Even better, a living resource.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.935
Fiona, you're the only witch
in our whole school.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.144
You're so lucky.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.438
Lucky. Right.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.984
Oh, by the way,
my wife and I sent our samples in,

03:55.068 --> 03:57.153
and we found out
that we're both part-witch.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.948
We're each one percent. Isn't that neat?

04:00.031 --> 04:00.949
-Yeah.
-We're pumped.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.826
Doesn't mean anything, but, um...

04:03.910 --> 04:04.827
-I'm sorry.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.664
-Yeah, scary.
-I don't think it works like that but...

04:07.747 --> 04:09.207
-No, it doesn't.
-Yeah. Okay.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.625
-Okay.
-Okay.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.341
Hey, Fiona, hang on.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.677
Emilio.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.512
Um... Hi.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.596
Hi.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.432
So... so what's up?

04:26.516 --> 04:29.852
Just... heading home
after a long day of learning.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.396
That's pretty crazy

04:31.479 --> 04:33.231
that Mr. Barnett gave you your own aunt.

04:33.314 --> 04:36.526
Yeah, but at least all I have to do
is make one phone call.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.611
Yep, that's true. Yeah, you got off easy.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.905
-You can just relax all weekend and...
-Yeah.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.576
Speaking of which, uh,
what are you doing Friday?

04:46.077 --> 04:48.663
<i>Yes, excuse me. Down here.</i>

04:49.789 --> 04:50.832
Fiona?

04:50.915 --> 04:52.292
Sorry.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.336
What am I doing... Friday?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.255
<i>How may I serve you today,
Your Witchiness?</i>

04:57.338 --> 04:59.382
<i>I don't need serving. Go away!</i>

04:59.465 --> 05:01.217
Um, I don't know. Is, is there something--

05:01.301 --> 05:03.303
Will you go to the homecoming dance
with me?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.764
You say,
if you don't have any plans, I mean.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.975
<i>Yes, excuse me again.</i>

05:09.058 --> 05:11.436
<i>Are you quite certain
you don't need anything?</i>

05:12.020 --> 05:13.229
<i>Not even a curse?</i>

05:14.022 --> 05:17.275
<i>I mean, I could scratch
the boy's face off for you.</i>

05:17.358 --> 05:18.985
-<i>No, no. Don't!</i>

05:19.902 --> 05:22.447
I thought you were going with Madison.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.241
Madison? What? No.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.785
I'm... I...

05:30.496 --> 05:31.372
Yes.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.540
-Yeah. I'd love to.
-Yeah?

05:32.623 --> 05:34.208
Okay, okay. Great. Great.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.918
So I'll just...
I'll pick you up at your house then.

05:38.629 --> 05:39.630
My house.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.432
Hi, Mom!

05:49.515 --> 05:51.934
Hey, honey.
I see you filed your claws again.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.186
Bye, Mom!

05:53.978 --> 05:55.855
-FIONA'Oh, hey, pumpkin.
-Hey, Dad.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.358
-Do I smell wart remover?
-Bye, Dad!

06:18.127 --> 06:20.380
I'll be working overtime
to file the motion to dismiss,

06:20.463 --> 06:22.673
so you won't be seeing
much of me next week.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.134
Or you could bewitch the judge.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.511
Kidding. Just kidding.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.721
We'll just have to destroy you

06:28.805 --> 06:31.099
in Poisoned Apples to Apples
next game night, hmm.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.517
-Right, Fi?
-Right.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.019
So, I have some news.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.687
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.231
Everything's great, actually.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.525
I just wanted to let you know

06:40.608 --> 06:43.027
that I'm going to
the homecoming dance on Friday.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.406
With a boy.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
-Oh, how nice!
-A human boy?

06:48.783 --> 06:50.284
He's coming to pick me up here,

06:50.368 --> 06:52.537
and I need you to promise me
that you will be normal.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.706
No spells, no spider webs,
nothing weird, okay?

06:56.958 --> 06:59.710
Dad, what did I just say?

07:01.045 --> 07:05.341
I just... I want Emilio to know
that I can be normal.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.844
Sure, sweetie.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.221
FIONA'We'll be normal.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.224
I wonder if Luna
would wanna go to the dance.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.852
Luna? Like Cousin Luna?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.645
She's arriving from England after dinner.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.647
Luna's coming here?

07:20.064 --> 07:21.524
Tonight?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.109
For how long?

07:23.192 --> 07:24.110
Just a few months.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.904
Her parents are renovating
the gingerbread cottage.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.990
They're finally giving in
and getting electricity.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.033
We thought it'd be nice for you
to have another witch your age around.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.660
Especially Luna.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.328
Those visits when you were little...

07:34.412 --> 07:35.621
Up all night, giggling.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.124
Yeah, but, um...
Does it have to be this week?

07:38.666 --> 07:39.959
You're not excited to see Luna?

07:40.042 --> 07:41.544
No! I am.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.504
I love Luna. She's great.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.755
She's...

07:44.839 --> 07:46.257
...just a little...

07:46.799 --> 07:48.593
A little... what?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.928
Fresh off the broomstick.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.069
-Honey, watch the plants!
-Got it, Dad!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.706
<i>Omnibus bene erit.</i>

08:21.918 --> 08:24.545
-So glad you made it safely, Luna.
-Oh.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.423
-FIONA'Hey.
-Hi.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.967
Tornado travel
can be tricky overseas, huh?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.969
Well, how else was I supposed to get here?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.638
A magical fireplace?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.768
Long time, cousin.

08:39.393 --> 08:40.770
Grown a few chin hairs

08:40.853 --> 08:42.355
-since I last saw you.
-How are you?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.773
It's good to see you, Luna.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.399
Hmm.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.985
So, lots to see here in the States.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.571
I guess you'll be traveling a lot,
flying around.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.949
Oh, no. Luna's going to school
with you, honey.

08:53.032 --> 08:53.950
What?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.326
FIONA'
Yeah, we already enrolled her.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.495
Is there a problem, Fi?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.121
No, no.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.498
I mean...

09:01.541 --> 09:04.710
It's just that it's a...
human school. Blah.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.506
And, uh, I just don't want Luna
to have a bad time, is all.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.258
If it's good enough for you,

09:10.341 --> 09:11.717
it's good enough for me.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.261
Don't you worry, cousin.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.388
We're going to have a grand time.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.098
-You'll see.
-Um...

09:19.392 --> 09:20.726
Right. Suffolk.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.062
-I'd almost forgotten about that.
-It was brilliant.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.730
And your idea, as I recall.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.232
Hexing cows to make chocolate milk.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.400
-Kind of a no-brainer.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.861
The townsfolk went positively mad.
What fun.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.780
Especially the cheese makers.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.782
Chocolate cheddar. Not good.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.577
Aw. I can't wait to meet your friends.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.496
Ooh, we should all go spirit chasing.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.706
Listen, Luna.

09:42.707 --> 09:46.002
Things are... different
from when we were kids.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.378
Obviously.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.755
We're old enough to use our wands now.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.675
Just imagine the power
of our hexes combined.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.052
Chocolate milk for days.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.264
Just follow my lead. Okay?

09:59.890 --> 10:01.058
Okay.

10:18.909 --> 10:22.079
<i>You're listening to BroomBro.
A production of Witch Public Radio.</i>

10:22.163 --> 10:24.040
-Good morning, Fiona.
-<i>The only podcast dedicated</i>

10:24.123 --> 10:25.458
<i>to witch founders and their lifestyle.</i>

10:26.167 --> 10:27.460
<i>Today, the topic your...</i>

10:27.543 --> 10:29.128
You're going like that?

10:29.211 --> 10:30.463
What's with all the make-up?

10:30.546 --> 10:31.881
-I can't even see your witch's mark.
-Aw!

10:31.964 --> 10:33.049
Oh, don't do that.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.551
And those shoes
can't possibly be comfortable.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.719
I'll be fine.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.181
Maybe lose the hat.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.183
Yeah, we have a strict dress code
at school.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.768
But it's the latest style.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.354
You girls might wanna get a move on
if you don't wanna be late.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.772
Don't worry, Uncle Arty.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.857
-Got a ride right here.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.233
Brand new Windrover.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.611
This baby will do 75 kilometers an hour.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.571
-Faster if the wind's at her back.
-Uh-uh.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.282
No way.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.242
I am not flying to school.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.623
Suit yourself.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.715
How was the walk?

11:14.799 --> 11:16.050
Invigorating.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.261
God, Fiona, you didn't tell us
you had a cousin.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.638
Or that she was a witch.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.348
Of course,
she's a witch, you idiot.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.808
But we haven't met the rest
of Fiona's family

11:23.891 --> 11:25.309
because she won't let us come over.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.435
Is that so?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.353
Yeah.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.604
I love your hat.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.064
Oh, thank you.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.273
You know what they say.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.068
"A witch without a hat is pointless."

11:35.569 --> 11:36.821
They think is.

11:36.904 --> 11:37.863
That's so fun.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.657
It's also quite versatile.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.409
I can dress it up for a night out.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.953
-Oh, wow.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.497
-Wow.
-Sparkly. So cool.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.832
Or Christmas.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.294
Christmas... So pretty!

11:52.378 --> 11:53.921
Do you have any more cousins?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.840
-I have none actually.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.926
Wait, so you're saying
there's no school dungeon?

11:59.009 --> 12:01.137
Where do you keep your dragons?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.305
I haven't seen a single ghost all morning.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.142
Oh, look it has a friend.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.060
Well, at least you have trolls. Hmm.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.019
That reminds me.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.067
Not that.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.237
-Nope.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.324
It's not this.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.494
-My grandmother's.
-Ooh.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.294
Ah. Here we are.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.796
Probably left it behind

12:35.880 --> 12:38.174
because it didn't fit
into your teeny-tiny pockets.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.508
Are you crazy?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.302
You can't bring wands to school, Luna.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.595
They're dangerous.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.514
Thought that didn't matter
in this country.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.230
Just be cool, okay?

12:53.314 --> 12:54.940
I am cool.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.951
Double, double toil in trouble

13:06.035 --> 13:07.787
Fire burn, and cauldron...

13:25.179 --> 13:28.015
-Try again.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.288
Oh, my gosh. Look at them.

13:51.372 --> 13:57.086
The secret to witch cuisine
is plenty of garlic and... heat.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.052
-Mmm.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.263
Is it supposed to wriggle like that?

14:08.305 --> 14:11.976
Early settlers traded goods
with the local covens

14:12.059 --> 14:15.396
in return for charms
and protective spells.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.898
They even adopted some witch customs.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.942
Luna, Fiona.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.820
Can you tell us any customs
that came from witches?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.780
Why are you asking us?

14:24.905 --> 14:25.823
Luna.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.616
No, no, let him answer.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.702
Why us?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.163
Well, because... you know.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.791
Because... we're witches?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.084
Luna, cool it.

14:37.167 --> 14:41.171
I certainly didn't mean any... harm,
I, I, I just thought you--

14:41.255 --> 14:44.133
You just thought,
"Let's call on the abracadabras.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.551
They'll have the answer.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.761
They know everything. They're magic."

14:47.845 --> 14:49.388
Makes me sick.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.557
I mean, honestly, you call this teaching?

14:53.559 --> 14:56.186
I voted for a witch in the last election.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.855
-Urgh, what a nightmare.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.065
Still, it's kind of wild
there's two witches in school.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.317
It's horrifying.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.484
You remember seventh grade

15:02.568 --> 15:05.112
when Fiona magically made bugs fly
out of everyone's hair?

15:05.195 --> 15:07.239
Oh, right. The great lice incident.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.490
They were moths, actually.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.576
And I was pulling wings
out of my hair for days.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.661
Oh, she's such an embarrassment.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.829
Definitely.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.634
Hey, where are you hurrying off to?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.177
Out of the way, warthog.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.261
Uh...

15:29.345 --> 15:31.096
Hey, what did you just say?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.056
Luna! Stop it!

15:32.139 --> 15:33.474
You let her talk to you like that?

15:33.557 --> 15:34.725
Let go of me!

15:35.351 --> 15:36.977
Try a curse on for size, you brat.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.771
Luna! Stop!

15:43.484 --> 15:44.652
-Boo.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.782
Hope you're ready for the dance, Fiona.

15:50.741 --> 15:51.867
It's gonna be wicked.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.793
What?

16:01.460 --> 16:03.504
I wasn't really going to curse her.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.547
Well, all right,
maybe just a little pig's tail.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.175
I didn't ask for your help, Luna.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.429
All I asked was for you to be cool,
but no, you just...

16:12.846 --> 16:14.306
you had to go and embarrass me.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.933
In front of the whole school.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.518
-Embarrass you?
-Yes!

16:18.852 --> 16:20.854
Why'd you have to go and be such a...

16:22.189 --> 16:23.941
Such a witch?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.403
Why can't you all just... be normal?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.127
Hey.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.424
Hey.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.679
You look very pink.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.557
I mean in a good way.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.436
-Fi, I--

17:02.646 --> 17:05.190
Well. Saved by the bell, eh?

17:06.316 --> 17:07.359
Yeah.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.381
Wow. You...

17:30.007 --> 17:31.383
You look beautiful.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.677
Thanks. You look beau...

17:33.761 --> 17:35.721
I mean, you look great, too.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.642
All right, all right,
enough with the googly eyes.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.145
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.191
Be back by midnight,
or I'll turn you both into pumpkins.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.486
-I mean it, I actually will.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.155
-Have a good time.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.865
-Honey.
-Hmm?

17:54.948 --> 17:56.366
Take off the tracking spell.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.243
Fine.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.003
Oh, here she is.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.797
Oh, my God!

18:12.800 --> 18:13.842
How about a photo?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.719
Make a memory?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.515
Let's just go dance instead.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.476
You don't want a picture with me?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.728
No! No, no, no, no, that's not it.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.189
I, I really, really want
a picture with you.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.565
It's just that I...

18:28.649 --> 18:32.861
'cause I have crazy sensitive eyes
and, you know, the flash and...

18:40.202 --> 18:42.204
I wanna remember every minute of this.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.730
Thanks for asking me.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.858
Thanks for saying yes.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.319
-So, sensitive eyes.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.696
Yeah, my whole life.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.574
No camera flashes, headlights.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.950
Sunlight's a killer.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.163
They're nice eyes.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.433
What's happening?

19:44.516 --> 19:45.767
What is it, a power surge?

19:53.901 --> 19:56.236
-What's going on?

19:56.820 --> 19:58.488
Cockroaches!

20:16.006 --> 20:17.674
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.676
Why are bugs falling from the sky?

20:20.677 --> 20:21.678
Is it your cousin?

20:22.262 --> 20:24.348
What? No, she's not even here!

20:24.431 --> 20:26.516
Then, is it you?

20:29.811 --> 20:31.313
I can't believe you'd ask me that.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.066
But... Fiona, who else could it be?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.318
Hang on. Everybody, just calm down.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.948
I didn't do it.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.241
Wait, Fi...

20:42.324 --> 20:43.242
Why did you say that?

20:43.325 --> 20:45.118
Oh, my God, there's one on your shoulder!

20:45.202 --> 20:46.495
Oh, my God.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.875
Get them off!

20:51.959 --> 20:54.211
They're literally everywhere!

21:01.718 --> 21:03.011
What are you doing here?

21:03.595 --> 21:06.682
I was feeling terrible
about how we left things.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.601
I came to apologize.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.689
I'm the one who should apologize.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.528
I felt so alone, Luna.

21:20.988 --> 21:25.867
I tried so hard to fit in,
but it didn't matter.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.912
No matter what I do,

21:28.996 --> 21:33.000
all they'll ever see me as is... a witch.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.879
Love...

21:37.963 --> 21:42.175
I had the blessing of growing up
surrounded by witches and warlocks.

21:43.010 --> 21:47.055
But you... you're under
a different kind of pressure.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.892
It's not easy, being one of a kind.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.646
I should have remembered that.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.485
You know what?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.363
If they're gonna see the witch...

22:04.281 --> 22:06.199
then let them see the witch.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.750
No more hiding.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.515
Now, shall we go back in there
and turn everyone into slugs?

22:32.976 --> 22:34.561
Oh, yeah.

22:34.644 --> 22:35.812
Come on.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.704
EMILIO Hey, are you okay?

22:52.788 --> 22:55.332
I was looking for you everywhere,
and I... whoa.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.796
You look good.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.673
I mean, you always look good, but...

23:04.424 --> 23:05.592
Wow.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.677
All right.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.012
I like him.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.514
Me too.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.018
We were scared and...

23:15.102 --> 23:17.020
And weren't thinking straight,
which is no excuse.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.271
We're thoughtless and stupid.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.773
I was thoughtless. You were stupid.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.483
You were both thoughtless and stupid.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.194
You're supposed to be my best friends.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.487
We are your best friends.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.823
We won't let you down again.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.741
Can you ever forgive us, Fi?

23:36.373 --> 23:40.419
Aw, still friends
even after Fiona ruined the dance.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.878
Real sweet.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.259
But you're not fooling anyone.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.927
Hey, Madison.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.055
Remember that time
I made bugs fly out of your hair?

23:54.891 --> 23:56.351
Well, that was a mistake.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.062
I didn't have control over my powers yet.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.648
But you?

24:04.025 --> 24:06.695
You have control
over your ugly personality.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.534
And I'm not gonna let you make
the rest of us as miserable as you are.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.670
It was Madison?

24:26.131 --> 24:27.466
Now, I don't know about you.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.051
But I came here to dance.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.055
<i>Omnibus bene erit.</i>

24:47.277 --> 24:48.570
Wow.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.377
Whoa.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.880
Are we still in the gym?

25:07.547 --> 25:09.841
Yes, Lianne, we're still in the gym.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.855
Wanna try another shot at a dance?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.432
You're quite sure
you've driven a broom before?

25:59.516 --> 26:01.977
I'm a witch. How hard can it be?

26:02.644 --> 26:04.312
Yeah, it's ridiculously hard.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.564
I'll figure it out.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.984
What?

26:09.067 --> 26:10.694
I...

26:12.279 --> 26:14.573
I don't feel alone anymore.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.037
You were never alone.

26:34.843 --> 26:35.677
Come on.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.516
-Hold on tight.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.940
Watch the tree. Watch the tree.
