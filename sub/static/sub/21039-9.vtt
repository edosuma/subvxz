scientifically,

02:48.733 --> 02:51.858

has been there for a very long time.

and dance in the air
to the sound of music.

13:17.025 --> 13:20.025
Then all you got to do
is drive under them.

13:20.150 --> 13:22.817
So come on, make with
some music already, man.

13:23.025 --> 13:26.067
Professor Von Drake, over and out.

13:27.108 --> 13:28.733
Well, how can we make music?

13:28.817 --> 13:30.775
We don't have any musical instruments.

13:30.858 --> 13:33.608
No, but we've got Mouseketools.

13:33.983 --> 13:36.400
[sing-song] Oh, Toodles!

13:41.400 --> 13:43.817
Here's Toodles!

13:46.983 --> 13:50.817
[Mickey] Hmm. We have a picture
of a musical note and...

13:50.900 --> 13:54.317
[Minnie] We need music,
so let's pick the musical note.

13:54.483 --> 13:56.150
[Mickey] You got it, Min.

13:56.275 --> 13:59.108
Hey, Toodles, what's behind
the musical note?

14:01.192 --> 14:03.483
-[Toodles] A tuba.
-[tuba sounds]

14:03.567 --> 14:06.983
[Mickey] We got ears. Say, "Cheers."

14:11.942 --> 14:14.233
I'll show you how it's done.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.733
And a one, and a two...

14:19.692 --> 14:25.692
[playing low tones]

14:26.900 --> 14:32.900
[tuba continues playing melody]

14:34.775 --> 14:36.692
We made it through the gulch.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.525
Good oompahs, Donald.

14:38.858 --> 14:39.900
[deep inhale]

14:39.983 --> 14:43.233
[loud blast]

14:45.108 --> 14:47.817
[chuckles] I did it.

14:48.025 --> 14:49.608
[groans]

14:49.692 --> 14:52.650
[giggles]
Looks like Donald's all tuba'd out.

14:53.650 --> 14:56.150
[makes wah-wah sound]

14:56.317 --> 15:00.233
Now, let's go find
Echo-Echo Canyon-Canyon.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.775
[tires screech]

15:19.067 --> 15:22.108
[tire screech echoes]

15:22.192 --> 15:25.567
You hear that? This must be
Echo-Echo Canyon-Canyon.

15:25.733 --> 15:28.400
I love echoes. When you make a loud sound,

15:28.483 --> 15:30.608
it bounces back so you hear it again.

15:30.858 --> 15:32.483
Oh, I got to try this.

15:34.650 --> 15:36.192
[inhales]

15:36.275 --> 15:37.817
Ya-hooey!

15:37.983 --> 15:41.400
[echoing] Ya-hooey!

15:41.775 --> 15:43.358
Oh, boy.

15:43.608 --> 15:46.275
[echoing] Oh, boy.

15:46.358 --> 15:48.733
My turn. Donald Duck.

15:49.817 --> 15:52.858
-[no echo]
-[crickets chirping]

15:52.942 --> 15:54.775
Donald Duck!

15:54.858 --> 15:56.983
[crickets chirping]

15:57.067 --> 15:59.067
[yelling] Donald Duck!

16:00.608 --> 16:03.317
Ah, come on, Donald. Let's go.

16:03.858 --> 16:05.400
Phooey.

16:05.483 --> 16:07.858
[echoing] Donald Duck. Phooey.

16:08.858 --> 16:10.525
[quacking angrily]

16:24.400 --> 16:27.775
We're here. The mouse-eared mystery.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.317
Come on, everybody.

16:30.525 --> 16:34.192
[Daisy] [gasps]
It's even more mysterious in person.

16:39.025 --> 16:42.858
Oh, my. It's too dark in there.
We can't see.

16:42.983 --> 16:46.442
Oh, I think we need a Mouseketool
to give us some light.

16:46.525 --> 16:47.775
Everybody say,

16:47.858 --> 16:50.150
[sing-song] "Oh, Toodles!"

16:50.233 --> 16:52.567
[sing-song] Oh, Toodles!

16:53.233 --> 16:54.275
[bell rings]

16:54.608 --> 16:56.983
Kansas City Mickey, I presume?

17:01.900 --> 17:04.733
[Mickey] All we have left
is the Mystery Mouseketool.

17:04.817 --> 17:09.275
Everybody say, "Mystery Mouseketool."

17:09.358 --> 17:12.358
[all] Mystery Mouseketool.

17:12.858 --> 17:15.233
[Mickey]
And today's Mystery Mouseketool is...

17:16.692 --> 17:20.025
A miner's helmet. Just what we need.

17:21.108 --> 17:25.983
We picked all our Mouseketools.
Say, "Super cheers."

17:33.400 --> 17:35.025
Wow!

17:36.567 --> 17:37.942
[Donald] Mickey.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.108
Mickey. Mickey...

17:40.192 --> 17:41.192
over here.

17:42.525 --> 17:45.275
[Minnie]
Oh, look, Donald found a light switch.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.483
[Goofy] Golly-gee-gosh-a-willikers.

17:49.608 --> 17:52.358
This place sure has lots of elbow room.

17:54.025 --> 17:56.400
Hey, it's gold!

17:56.525 --> 18:00.150
Donald's right. The floor is gold!

18:02.775 --> 18:05.900
Take a look at this. More pictures.

18:06.108 --> 18:08.025
I recognize some of these.

18:08.108 --> 18:11.775
Here's the heart, the ear,
and the musical note.

18:12.067 --> 18:13.608
And this is...

18:15.275 --> 18:16.483
the number two.

18:16.608 --> 18:19.400
And, gosh, this first picture is me.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.400
What does it all mean?

18:22.567 --> 18:24.483
It's some kind of message.

18:24.733 --> 18:27.233
Come on, let's figure it out together.

18:27.650 --> 18:28.942
This picture is...

18:30.775 --> 18:33.150
me, right. "Mickey."

18:33.858 --> 18:35.275
And the heart means...

18:36.983 --> 18:38.400
love.

18:38.775 --> 18:41.025
And here's the number two.

18:41.483 --> 18:43.733
So far, the message says,

18:43.983 --> 18:46.317
"Mickey loves to..."

18:46.650 --> 18:49.942
Now, this is the ear. What do ears do?

18:51.775 --> 18:53.567
Right. They hear.

18:54.025 --> 18:56.442
So, now the message says,

18:56.525 --> 18:59.650
"Mickey loves to hear..."

18:59.983 --> 19:01.442
What's this?

19:02.692 --> 19:04.108
Music.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.483
So, the message says,

19:06.567 --> 19:10.692
"Mickey loves to hear music."

19:11.192 --> 19:12.942
Mickey loves to hear music!

19:13.025 --> 19:15.442
[bells dinging]

19:15.525 --> 19:18.025
Whoa! This can't be goody-good.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.650

19:34.942 --> 19:35.983
Jump!

19:36.233 --> 19:37.650
[all] Whee!

19:40.650 --> 19:42.150
Kansas City Mickey,

19:42.233 --> 19:45.525
what is going on
with the mouse-eared mystery?

19:45.983 --> 19:47.733
I think I figured it out.

19:48.275 --> 19:49.650
Those ears up there...

19:51.942 --> 19:53.608
are really speakers.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.942
And the round gold floor is a record,

19:56.108 --> 19:59.692
which makes the whole place
a big, old record player.

20:00.025 --> 20:02.692
A record player? What's that?

20:02.858 --> 20:04.817
It's an ancient machine.

20:05.483 --> 20:09.358
A long, long time ago,
folks used to play music on them.

20:10.233 --> 20:14.400
[music starts]

20:14.483 --> 20:16.358
And I bet the mouse-eared mystery

20:16.442 --> 20:19.983

to repeat the music.
