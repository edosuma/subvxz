00:00.403 --> 00:02.048
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.079 --> 00:05.814
- What's going on?
- Peter and I, we've...

00:06.189 --> 00:07.851
we've decided to separate.

00:07.885 --> 00:09.253
What is your problem?!

00:09.287 --> 00:11.921
So what if you were abandoned! Who cares?!

00:11.956 --> 00:15.091
That's what people do, they hurt you!

00:15.126 --> 00:19.928
Minister:
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

00:19.963 --> 00:21.697
You may kiss each other.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.633
(Laughing and cheering)

00:26.218 --> 00:28.354
So I guess I did it.

00:28.572 --> 00:30.405
I married the boy in the loft.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.740
- Stop the car, please.
- Hey.

00:31.775 --> 00:34.609
(Trouble whinnies, hooves thunder)

00:36.411 --> 00:39.747
(Snorts and neighs)

00:41.784 --> 00:43.585
It's okay.

00:50.525 --> 00:52.425
(Hooves thud heavily)

00:54.295 --> 00:56.429
(Grunting)

00:57.732 --> 01:01.602

01:13.080 --> 01:16.415
(Hooves thud heavily,
Phoenix and Trouble grunt)

01:17.684 --> 01:19.752
Whoa, Trouble, slow down.

01:19.786 --> 01:22.021
Trouble, no! Whoa!

01:22.055 --> 01:24.023
Ungh! Ungh! Ungh!

01:24.057 --> 01:25.357
Are you okay?

01:25.391 --> 01:27.692
Ungh! Yup, I'm fine.

01:27.727 --> 01:30.328
You were looking pretty
good there for a minute.

01:30.362 --> 01:33.364
Phoenix is great, but it's Trouble...

01:33.398 --> 01:35.399
He's a little harder to handle.

01:35.434 --> 01:36.835
What do you think?

01:36.869 --> 01:39.037
Peter: I think you're certifiably crazy,

01:39.071 --> 01:40.471
that's what I think.

01:40.506 --> 01:42.473
Getting better though. Better all the time.

01:42.508 --> 01:45.175
(Hooves thud)

01:45.209 --> 01:47.277
(Birds chirp, insects buzz)

01:53.151 --> 01:54.785
(Light clunk)

02:03.460 --> 02:05.327
Ty: Hey, Tim, it's Ty.

02:05.362 --> 02:08.097
Listen,
I don't know if you've got my messages,

02:08.132 --> 02:09.931
but, uh, look, I have some time off from
the clinic today, so I can't help you out.

02:09.967 --> 02:12.468
Just let me know when
you're gonna be there, okay?

02:12.502 --> 02:13.936
Call me back. (Phone beeps off)

02:16.073 --> 02:18.006
Morning.

02:18.041 --> 02:20.475
Hey, good morning.

02:20.509 --> 02:22.343
Oh, I love Saturdays.

02:22.378 --> 02:25.246
I love being able to sleep in.

02:25.281 --> 02:26.614
Did you hear that wind last night?

02:26.649 --> 02:28.984
I thought the trailer was gonna blow over.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.352
I haven't had a decent night's
sleep since our honeymoon.

02:31.387 --> 02:32.788
That was pretty nice.

02:32.822 --> 02:36.557
You know what?
We gotta get outta this place.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.693
I gotta say, I'm pretty ticked
off with your dad right now.

02:38.727 --> 02:41.962
- Oh, really?
- Well, he's ignoring my calls.

02:41.997 --> 02:44.298
I'm trying to get this
moving and at this rate,

02:44.332 --> 02:46.100
it's never gonna get done.

02:46.134 --> 02:51.108
But we will be moved in soon, okay?

02:51.906 --> 02:55.641
I'm just so excited to be able to
have a place of our own, you know?

02:55.676 --> 02:58.144
I mean, it... It has kinda been nice

02:58.179 --> 03:00.279
living out here, by ourselves...

03:00.314 --> 03:02.515
- Yeah.
- Don't you think?

03:02.549 --> 03:04.350
- No one to bother us.
- Mmm.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.319
Sort of like being on our honeymoon.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.487
(Both chuckle)

03:11.758 --> 03:13.992
Whoa...

03:14.027 --> 03:16.661
Stay close, Trouble.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.033
That's it.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.001
Whoa...

03:25.403 --> 03:26.838
Good boy!

03:26.872 --> 03:28.305
So,
you got guests coming into the Dude Ranch.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.407
- Yes.
- I'll vacate the cabin.

03:30.442 --> 03:32.176
Yeah, uh, Amy's room is already ready

03:32.211 --> 03:33.544
and I put fresh towels on the bed.

03:33.578 --> 03:35.713
That's it. Whoa... Whoa...

03:35.748 --> 03:37.248
Are you sure you're okay with that?

03:37.282 --> 03:39.550
Peter,
how many times do I have to tell you?

03:39.584 --> 03:40.985
Just because we're separated

03:41.019 --> 03:43.253
doesn't mean you can't
sleep under the same roof.

03:43.287 --> 03:45.455
I mean, we're both adults, right?

03:45.489 --> 03:47.390
Absolutely.

03:47.424 --> 03:49.559
I'm proud of us.

03:49.593 --> 03:52.495
I am!
I mean, look how well this is working out.

03:52.529 --> 03:54.664
You know, we've made it work.

03:54.698 --> 03:56.566
You're right.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.669
A lot of couples wouldn't
handle it as well as we have.

04:00.703 --> 04:02.571
You know I'm really proud of the girls too.

04:02.605 --> 04:04.640
Roman riding. I mean, honestly?

04:04.674 --> 04:06.608
- Who would've guessed.
- She's obsessed.

04:06.643 --> 04:08.443
Hey, did I tell you Georgie's Extreme Team

04:08.478 --> 04:10.345
is booked at a bunch of
rodeos over the summer?

04:10.380 --> 04:13.048
Aw, the summer?

04:13.083 --> 04:14.108
What?

04:14.128 --> 04:16.171
I wanted to have the girls
with me over the summer.

04:16.185 --> 04:19.754
- Oh. Like in Vancouver?
- Yeah.

04:19.789 --> 04:21.255
- Oh...
- It'd be great for them, don't you think?

04:21.290 --> 04:23.258
(Cell phone rings)Wow.

04:23.292 --> 04:26.027
(Ringing)Ugh. Sorry. I got...

04:26.061 --> 04:27.461
- I gotta take this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, take it.

04:27.496 --> 04:29.297
Okay. (Phone beeps on)

04:29.331 --> 04:31.299
Hey, Bernie, what's up?

04:31.333 --> 04:33.533
(Truck engine rumbles)

04:35.703 --> 04:38.305
(Truck idles, Engine shuts down)

04:38.339 --> 04:41.608
(Doors bang shut)

04:41.642 --> 04:44.244
Hey, Lou, have you seen Tim?

04:44.279 --> 04:45.645
Not today.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.815
He was around for a bit yesterday.

04:47.849 --> 04:50.516
(Annoyed sigh)

04:51.985 --> 04:54.287
Georgie: Come on, come on!

04:54.321 --> 04:56.555
No! Trouble, settle...

04:56.589 --> 04:58.624
Amy: She's really starting to get it.

04:58.658 --> 05:02.361
Yup, and I'm getting grey hairs.
(Laughs)

05:02.395 --> 05:03.629
Hey, do you know what's going on with Dad?

05:03.663 --> 05:05.097
'Cause Ty's been trying to reach him.

05:05.132 --> 05:07.565
Amy, don't even go there

05:07.599 --> 05:10.335
because I am doing everything
I can to avoid hornet's nest.

05:10.369 --> 05:12.904
And when Grandpa gets back... (Laughs)

05:12.939 --> 05:15.640
That is an inevitable
scene I want to avoid too.

05:15.674 --> 05:17.008
Georgie: Up, up!

05:17.043 --> 05:19.610
(Grunting) That's it. Good.

05:19.645 --> 05:21.713
Hey, would you mind just watching Georgie?

05:21.747 --> 05:25.482
Peter and I have to...
just figure our schedules out.

05:25.516 --> 05:27.617
Okay. Are you all right?

05:27.652 --> 05:31.588
Mm-hmm. I'm great. I'm-I'm really good.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.058
Okay, you just seem, I don't know,

05:34.092 --> 05:35.659
a little smiley or something.

05:35.693 --> 05:37.694
Is that a bad thing? (Laughs)

05:37.729 --> 05:39.096
Come on, Katie.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.897
(Katie hums as she runs, Amy Sighs)

05:40.931 --> 05:44.533
(Truck rumbles to a halt, door bangs shut)

05:46.470 --> 05:49.505
Tim: Okay, I got...
I got all your messages,

05:49.539 --> 05:53.109
and I appreciate the fact that you...
you wanna help.

05:53.143 --> 05:54.577
(Heavy clunk)

05:54.611 --> 05:58.480
Ty, you have to understand
that there are some jobs

05:58.514 --> 06:00.515
that are best dealt with
if I tackle them alone.

06:00.549 --> 06:03.018
Tim, you don't need to do
this all yourself, okay?

06:03.052 --> 06:04.486
I don't want you to do
this all by yourself.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.454
I just want it done so that we can move in!

06:06.489 --> 06:09.057
I realize that,
but you kids picked a project

06:09.092 --> 06:11.360
that requires a gut reno

06:11.394 --> 06:13.628
and obviously you don't have
enough time to devote to it, so...

06:13.662 --> 06:16.163
I know, and I feel bad, okay?

06:16.198 --> 06:18.165
But I'm here now and I can help.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.566
Right. So what're we standing here for?

06:19.601 --> 06:21.135
You unload all this stuff.

06:21.169 --> 06:22.937
Let's get to work on this dream.

06:22.971 --> 06:24.538
Living in a loft above a stable of horses

06:24.572 --> 06:27.441
not exactly my idea of a dream.

06:27.475 --> 06:30.111
(Loud clunk, pipes slide)

06:30.145 --> 06:32.145
Georgie: Whoa, Trouble!

06:32.179 --> 06:35.448
Relax! Relax. Whoa...

06:35.482 --> 06:38.018
Trouble, it's okay.

06:40.754 --> 06:45.591
(Grunting) It's okay. Good boy.
Keep your head steady.

06:45.626 --> 06:47.627
Good boy.

06:47.661 --> 06:50.396
Easy, boy.

06:50.430 --> 06:51.830
Whoa! Whoa!

06:51.864 --> 06:53.465
Trouble, you can't pull away like that!

06:53.499 --> 06:55.667
You have to stay beside Phoenix.

06:58.238 --> 06:59.571
Ungh! (Thumps on ground)

06:59.605 --> 07:02.441
- How's it going?
- Well, it's going.

07:02.475 --> 07:06.244
Trouble's still... "Trouble."

07:06.278 --> 07:08.146
(Sighs) He lets me know when he's done.

07:08.180 --> 07:10.014
Yeah, I'll help you untack them.

07:10.049 --> 07:12.450
Okay.

07:14.686 --> 07:17.155
(Horse grunts)

07:17.189 --> 07:19.324
Amy?

07:22.661 --> 07:24.494
He's hurt.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.396
- See all the blood?
- Yeah.

07:26.431 --> 07:28.131
(Horse grunts, light hoof beats)

07:28.166 --> 07:30.467
(Amy sighs)

07:31.869 --> 07:33.403
(Struggling grunts)

07:34.805 --> 07:36.573
(Hooves thunder)

07:39.277 --> 07:41.377
(Harness jingles)

07:45.115 --> 07:48.250
(Light hoof beats)

07:48.285 --> 07:51.387
(Birds chirp, Harness jingles)

07:51.421 --> 07:53.522
(Crow caws)

07:55.258 --> 07:57.359
Shhh...

07:59.161 --> 08:01.429
(Horse blows out its breath)

08:02.798 --> 08:04.599
Let's go.

08:07.370 --> 08:09.670
(Light hoof beats, birds chirp)

08:14.075 --> 08:17.644
(Nervous snort and whinny)

08:21.383 --> 08:23.283
(Bear growls ferociously, horses whinny)

08:23.318 --> 08:24.718
- Easy!
- Georgie, just stay-stay calm.

08:24.752 --> 08:26.186
It's okay.

08:26.221 --> 08:29.356
(Bear growls, horses whinny)

08:30.991 --> 08:33.326
Hang on to him. Don't let him bolt.

08:34.928 --> 08:36.662
It's okay.

08:37.996 --> 08:40.700
(Horses grunt nervously,
pawing at the ground)

So you're talking about the whole summer

09:27.444 --> 09:29.879
Yeah. It'll be a new world for them.

09:29.913 --> 09:32.615
We can, uh, spend time at the beach,
they can swim,

09:32.649 --> 09:34.483
I'll teach them how to sail.

09:34.517 --> 09:38.487
Go camping. It's gonna be great.

09:38.521 --> 09:40.488
- What?
- I mean, Peter, you have to admit,

09:40.522 --> 09:43.058
this is kind of being sprung
on me out of the blue.

09:43.092 --> 09:45.627
Not really. I mean,
you knew I wanted them out there, right?

09:45.661 --> 09:46.865
What better time than the summer?

09:46.885 --> 09:50.932
- Right, but the whole summer? I mean...
- I think we...

09:50.967 --> 09:53.068
There was this wounded horse
and Amy and I were following it

09:53.102 --> 09:55.870
and get guess what came
right out of the bush? Guess!

09:55.905 --> 09:57.404
- What?
- A bear!

09:57.424 --> 09:58.358
A bear?

09:58.378 --> 10:00.540
Yeah, he was huge and he came right at us!

10:00.575 --> 10:02.009
It was so awesome.

10:02.043 --> 10:05.145
No, no, that is not awesome.
You could've been...

10:05.179 --> 10:07.114
Well, the horse,
he was like bleeding, like a lot.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.016
Yeah, I think the bear attacked him.

10:09.050 --> 10:10.884
And he's still out there,
so we have to go find him.

10:10.919 --> 10:14.654
No, no. You're not going anywhere
near that bear or the woods.

10:14.688 --> 10:17.090
- I mean it.
- But he's gonna bleed to death.

10:17.124 --> 10:19.626
- We have to!
- Georgie, I'm not telling you again.

10:19.660 --> 10:23.730
- Dad, you'll go with us, right?
- It's not happening, Georgie!

10:23.764 --> 10:25.131
It's not happening.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.966
What's going on? Why are you so mad?

10:27.001 --> 10:28.735
I'm gonna call Fish and Wildlife.

- Jack!
- Hey!

10:59.197 --> 11:01.999
Grandpa! Hey, how was Arizona?

11:02.034 --> 11:03.600
Did you have a good time?
How was your drive?

11:03.635 --> 11:05.001
Long!

11:05.036 --> 11:06.469
We missed you. (Kiss)

11:06.503 --> 11:08.071
Welcome back.

11:11.108 --> 11:14.144
I gotta question for you.
(Cupboard bangs shut)

11:14.178 --> 11:16.512
What the hell is happening
with that barn out there?

11:16.547 --> 11:17.947
And here we go.

11:17.982 --> 11:19.916
I see a bunch of plastic
flapping in the wind

11:19.950 --> 11:21.884
and nothing much else.

11:21.918 --> 11:23.686
What happened to finishing the loft?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.620
What the heck have you been doing?

11:25.655 --> 11:28.223
This is typical of you. Typical.

11:29.693 --> 11:31.060
You disappear for a few months

11:31.094 --> 11:34.096
and you come swanning back
and start to complain.

11:34.130 --> 11:35.664
Where were you when I needed your help?

11:35.699 --> 11:37.199
I offered my help.

11:37.233 --> 11:40.467
You said you didn't need it,
so I went to Arizona.

11:40.502 --> 11:43.537
That loft was supposed to
be finished for Amy and Ty.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.940
- What happened to the contractor?
- Grandpa, it's okay.

11:45.974 --> 11:48.542
Forget the contractor. I'm the contractor.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.944
Ugh...

11:49.978 --> 11:51.846
A job like this has to be done

11:51.880 --> 11:53.981
in a logical way step by step.

11:54.016 --> 11:56.583
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah, that's right, Jack.

11:56.617 --> 11:58.618
And before I could even start work,

11:58.652 --> 12:01.021
I had to clear out the loft.
Do you know how much crap's in there?

12:01.055 --> 12:03.724
You should, because most of it was yours.

12:03.758 --> 12:05.291
And after I cleaned out all your crap,

12:05.326 --> 12:06.693
and then, and only then,

12:06.728 --> 12:08.762
could I start to work on the loft.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.031
Did you see that I had cut the windows.

12:11.065 --> 12:13.099
Did you? Did you? No? Didn't see that.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.102
That's my process. Logical, step by step.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.871
I got it under control. Jack!

12:19.012 --> 12:20.270
Hey, Jack!

12:20.290 --> 12:22.507
It's almost the same as it was when I left!

12:22.542 --> 12:24.710
- You haven't even done anything.
- Oh, Jack, come on.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.979
You're staring at all new wiring here.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.081
Did it last week, better than an
electrician can do it and all to code.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.882
So I saved you guys a
ton of money right there.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.884
- And that's really great, Dad.
- It-it is... great,

12:32.918 --> 12:34.853
and thank you, Tim. Um...

12:34.887 --> 12:37.188
but we do need to talk about these windows.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.958
Um,
there's a huge lead time on ordering them

12:39.992 --> 12:42.227
and we may need to... just re-measure.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.562
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I know the dimensions.

12:44.596 --> 12:47.131
I know what you want.
You want lots of light, lots of windows.

12:47.165 --> 12:50.200
It's gonna be beautiful.
Look it, the plans.

12:50.235 --> 12:53.804
No, I've seen the plans.
Amy and I made these plans.

12:53.838 --> 12:55.139
We've been going over them for months,
so...

12:55.173 --> 12:56.774
I know, but it's one thing to make plans,

12:56.808 --> 12:58.909
it's another thing to implement the plans.

12:58.943 --> 13:00.677
Now, if you're gonna help me today,

13:00.711 --> 13:01.979
the order on the plate is plumbing.

13:02.013 --> 13:03.546
We're gonna finish the
supply and the drainage

13:03.581 --> 13:04.981
to the toilet and tub.

13:05.015 --> 13:06.916
I-Okay, I've been doing work on the drains

13:06.950 --> 13:09.218
and the supplies are next.

13:09.253 --> 13:10.486
Okay, partner.

13:12.856 --> 13:14.657
Is that the-that's the
supply for the toilet?

13:14.691 --> 13:17.160
- That's the soil stack?
- Yeah.

13:17.194 --> 13:18.360
Okay, now, anybody that's done any plumbing

13:18.395 --> 13:20.062
knows that that supply and that soil stack

13:20.097 --> 13:21.429
need to be much closer together.

13:21.463 --> 13:23.698
But it's okay,
because I can make a quick adjustment.

13:23.732 --> 13:25.801
I'll get my tools.

13:25.835 --> 13:28.536
Jack, we got this. We got it.

13:29.972 --> 13:32.440
We're separated, Lou.

13:32.474 --> 13:34.609
That means sharing our time with the kids,
right? (Sighs)

13:34.643 --> 13:36.011
You get them way more than I do.

13:36.045 --> 13:38.612
- Well, I'm there mother.
- Yeah, well, I'm their father.

13:38.646 --> 13:40.681
Okay. Let's take this down a notch.

13:40.715 --> 13:44.751
Um, I just feel like this has
been sprung on me all of a sudden.

13:44.786 --> 13:46.120
No one sprung anything on you.

13:46.154 --> 13:47.454
We always agreed on shared custody,

13:47.488 --> 13:49.091
we just need to be reasonable about it.

13:49.111 --> 13:52.059
We have been reasonable.
I mean, we are... reasonable.

13:52.093 --> 13:54.161
We're reasonable. I just um...

13:54.196 --> 13:55.895
Maybe we should at least
run this by the girls first

13:55.930 --> 13:57.563
- and see what they think.
- Sure.

13:57.597 --> 14:01.134
- Run what by the girls?
- Hey! I've got a great idea.

14:01.168 --> 14:03.569
That your dad and I need to
just discuss a little bit more

14:03.603 --> 14:05.171
before we run it by you.

14:05.206 --> 14:06.639
It's Georgie, I think we can tell Georgie.

14:06.673 --> 14:09.575
No... more discussion first.

14:09.609 --> 14:11.444
- Okay. Whatever.
- Yeah.

14:11.478 --> 14:14.112
- Okay, we'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

14:14.147 --> 14:17.082
(Screen door creaks open) That's...

14:18.617 --> 14:21.686
(Door closes) Okay.

14:21.721 --> 14:25.090
So how you feeling, Paint, old friend?

14:25.124 --> 14:28.126
I gotta say, it's good to see you.

14:28.161 --> 14:32.496
Hey, did you get more handsome
on me while I was away?

14:32.530 --> 14:34.565
Yes, I think you did.

14:34.599 --> 14:37.735
(Giggles) Georgie.

14:37.769 --> 14:41.272
(Giggles)I... was just saying hello.

14:41.306 --> 14:43.040
He missed you.

14:43.075 --> 14:45.609
Hey, don't tell me that's Trouble.

14:45.643 --> 14:47.410
It is.

14:47.444 --> 14:51.714
- Boy, he's come a long way!
- Yeah, he has.

14:51.749 --> 14:53.984
- I can do tricks on him now.
- No.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.685
He's a good boy.

14:55.719 --> 14:58.054
So things are going good then?

14:58.089 --> 15:01.224
(Hesitates) Uh, yeah. Most of the time.

15:01.259 --> 15:03.692
Uh... it's weird.

15:03.726 --> 15:06.795
I mean, it's okay, but it's just weird.

15:06.829 --> 15:08.530
- I'm good though.
- Mm-hm?

15:08.564 --> 15:10.086
Yeah.

15:10.106 --> 15:12.434
Sounds like you and me,
we got some catching up to do.

15:12.468 --> 15:15.804
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

15:15.838 --> 15:18.040
(Receding footsteps)

15:20.609 --> 15:23.444
(Crow caws in the distance)

15:24.880 --> 15:27.916
(Birds chirp)

15:37.225 --> 15:38.691
(Footsteps scuff)

16:05.618 --> 16:08.387
Good boy.

16:12.558 --> 16:15.026
(Nervous snorting and whinnying) Whoa,
whoa, whoa...

16:15.061 --> 16:16.627
Whoa... (Trouble snorts softly)

16:16.662 --> 16:18.663
(Hooves thud)

16:18.697 --> 16:21.933
Georgie! What are you doing out here?!

16:21.968 --> 16:23.501
Well, what're you doing out here?

16:23.535 --> 16:26.004
(Sighs) I saw that Trouble
wasn't in his stall

16:26.038 --> 16:27.939
and I had a pretty good
idea where you two went.

16:27.973 --> 16:30.674
- You shouldn't be out here on your own.
- Well, neither should you.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.576
- Look, if Lou finds out...
- She won't!

16:32.610 --> 16:34.778
Georgie, let's go, now, okay?

16:34.812 --> 16:36.546
No! He's still out here. He came back,

16:36.581 --> 16:38.815
he's out here somewhere.

16:42.487 --> 16:45.855
There he is. I told you.

16:48.780 --> 16:50.759
Hey...

16:51.374 --> 16:53.124
Good boy...

16:54.464 --> 16:56.565
Oh, that's it.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.182
Good. You're okay.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.037
Ooh...

17:02.071 --> 17:03.672
Good boy.

17:05.407 --> 17:06.973
(Hooves thud)

17:07.009 --> 17:08.710
That's it.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.479
All right.

17:11.513 --> 17:14.080
Let's get him back to the ranch.

17:16.885 --> 17:20.387
(Phoenix grunts, hooves thud)

17:26.465 --> 17:30.574
Why didn't you tell me that Tim
was dropping the barn of that project?

17:30.694 --> 17:33.663
I can't keep track of what
Dad is doing or not doing.

17:33.697 --> 17:35.465
You know, it's not like I don't
have a million other things

17:35.500 --> 17:36.900
to keep my eye on.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.467
You should've called me,
or sent me a picture

17:38.502 --> 17:40.036
of what's been going on there.

17:40.070 --> 17:42.271
I'd have lit a fire under him real quick.

17:42.305 --> 17:43.605
You know what, Grandpa, I have...

17:43.640 --> 17:45.474
a lot more issues to deal with right now

17:45.509 --> 17:47.976
than keeping Dad on a building schedule.

17:49.446 --> 17:52.981
- He's staying here?
- Yeah.

17:53.016 --> 17:56.584
While there are guests at the Dude Ranch.

17:56.618 --> 18:00.288
It doesn't mean anything, Grandpa.

18:00.322 --> 18:03.270
So you two are okay then?

18:04.226 --> 18:06.261
We're doing great.

18:06.295 --> 18:08.029
Yeah, you are.

18:08.064 --> 18:11.433
I admire how you and Peter
are dealing with this.

18:11.467 --> 18:14.435
Keep that smile on your face.

18:18.173 --> 18:20.474
(Hooves thud, horses snort)

18:22.710 --> 18:25.612
(Hooves clop)

18:27.248 --> 18:29.248
- Amy: Hey.
- Ty: Hey.

18:29.283 --> 18:31.050
(Plastic rustles)

18:32.486 --> 18:33.919
What's going on here?

18:33.954 --> 18:35.354
Georgie and I saw him
out in the woods earlier.

18:35.389 --> 18:36.689
We figured we'd try to get him.

18:36.723 --> 18:40.393
Ty, he's hurt real bad.
A bear attack maybe?

18:40.427 --> 18:42.261
Can you have a look?

18:42.296 --> 18:46.998
Oh wow. Yeah, that's definitely a bear.

18:47.032 --> 18:50.068
It's not too deep though.
I'll give him some antibiotics.

18:50.103 --> 18:52.370
So you're not helping me.

18:52.405 --> 18:54.606
Just give me a minute, all right?

18:54.640 --> 18:57.576
Please don't tell Lou about the horse.

18:57.610 --> 19:00.078
I think it's too late, honey.

19:00.113 --> 19:01.513
Georgie?!

19:01.547 --> 19:03.680
Didn't I tell you not to
go near those woods again?!

19:03.715 --> 19:06.617
(Sighs) Great.

19:08.987 --> 19:11.589
Well,
I don't think he's gonna need stitches.

19:11.623 --> 19:13.224
This part of the gash is pretty deep,

19:13.258 --> 19:14.558
but I'm gonna keep cleaning it out

19:14.593 --> 19:17.094
- and make sure it doesn't get infected.
- Okay.

19:17.129 --> 19:19.029
I wonder where he came from.

19:19.063 --> 19:22.565
You know, we should probably
put an ad up at Maggie's.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.336
You're pretty brave to fend
off that bear there, Mister.

19:26.370 --> 19:28.571
Hey, maybe that's what we'll call him.

19:28.606 --> 19:29.805
Bear.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.674
(Chuckles) That kinda suits him.

19:31.708 --> 19:35.245
Yeah. Do you like that?
Oh you do, huh, Bear?

19:35.279 --> 19:37.179
(Chuckles)

19:37.213 --> 19:40.516
(Liquid pours)

19:40.550 --> 19:43.519
(Stirring clinks, tapping)

19:45.321 --> 19:47.722
(Bear snorts softly)

19:52.094 --> 19:53.995
(Tapping)

19:56.031 --> 20:00.134
This is good, working together like this.

20:00.169 --> 20:02.370
(Kiss, Amy chuckles)

20:02.404 --> 20:05.439
Why is it just us anyway? Where's Peter?

20:05.474 --> 20:07.575
He had a dinner appointment in town.

20:07.609 --> 20:09.544
- And Georgie?
- In her room.

20:09.578 --> 20:12.646
- She said she wasn't hungry.
- Oh?

20:16.150 --> 20:19.519
She's not happy with me. I mean...

20:19.554 --> 20:22.121
Georgie has been coping
so well with Peter and I

20:22.156 --> 20:24.191
and our... situation,

20:24.225 --> 20:27.394
but lately,
I feel like she's using it as an excuse

20:27.428 --> 20:29.728
to get and do whatever she wants.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.697
You're reading too much into it.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.799
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.703
I think Georgie can't stand the
thought of an animal suffering

20:37.737 --> 20:40.138
without trying to do something about it.

20:40.173 --> 20:43.509
That's pretty simple to me.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.844
Well, if you don't mind, I'm exhausted.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.146
I'm gonna turn in early.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.516
- Mm, no, no, no.
- I'll help you with the dishes here.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.917
No, uh, it's fine.
Me and Katie have it, right?

20:52.951 --> 20:54.352
Katie's gonna help Mommy?

20:54.386 --> 20:57.622
- I'll bring the plates.
- All right.

20:57.656 --> 21:00.157
(Footsteps creak on stairs)

21:00.192 --> 21:02.292
(Light knock)

21:02.327 --> 21:03.960
It's not fair.

21:03.994 --> 21:05.462
If Amy and I hadn't rescued that horse,

21:05.496 --> 21:07.664
he would've died.

21:07.699 --> 21:10.166
And besides, nothing bad happened,

21:10.201 --> 21:11.768
so I don't why she's so mad?

21:11.802 --> 21:16.306
Well,
because I'm guessing that your mom's tired

21:16.341 --> 21:18.007
of telling you not to do something

21:18.042 --> 21:20.409
and then you go ahead and do it anyway.

21:20.444 --> 21:22.545
Well, I'm tired too.

21:22.579 --> 21:25.348
The way she's acting with Dad.

21:25.382 --> 21:27.617
What does that mean?

21:27.651 --> 21:29.685
- You've been away, Jack.
- Yes, I have,

21:29.720 --> 21:31.687
but they've been doing
great from what I heard,

21:31.722 --> 21:33.422
and now I see it for myself.

21:33.457 --> 21:37.058
That's what they look like, but...

21:37.092 --> 21:39.327
- They're being all weird.
- What do you mean, weird?

21:39.362 --> 21:40.762
- Lou's not weird.
- Yes, she is.

21:40.796 --> 21:44.599
She's being all fake,
especially when Peter's around.

21:44.634 --> 21:46.301
And I know she's trying to make it seem

21:46.335 --> 21:48.069
like everything's okay for Katie and I,

21:48.103 --> 21:50.338
but... it's just not her.

21:50.373 --> 21:52.607
Well, all in all,

21:52.642 --> 21:56.042
I think they're doing a
good job working things out.

21:56.077 --> 21:58.579
At least they don't have a
whole pack of lawyers involved,

21:58.613 --> 22:00.447
'cause that's when things get ugly.

22:00.482 --> 22:05.619
We're all glad they haven't
gone down that road, believe me.

22:05.654 --> 22:09.156
(Sighs) Okay. (Hands clap lightly)

22:09.190 --> 22:11.424
See you in the morning.

22:11.458 --> 22:14.661
And cut your Mom just a bit of a break.

22:16.764 --> 22:18.598
Jack...

22:21.201 --> 22:24.236
I'm glad you're home.

22:24.271 --> 22:26.673
(Floor creaks)

22:26.707 --> 22:29.608
(Crickets chirp)

22:31.177 --> 22:33.011
(Light switch snicks)

22:36.582 --> 22:39.318
(Knocking, door creaks open)

22:39.352 --> 22:41.920
- Oh, Hey.
- Hey.

22:41.954 --> 22:43.755
Um, sorry I missed dinner. (Door closes)

22:43.790 --> 22:45.489
No, that's okay.

22:45.524 --> 22:47.591
Um...

22:49.703 --> 22:52.110
- so...
- So...

22:52.263 --> 22:54.465
I-I uh... I was looking at my calendar

22:54.499 --> 22:57.435
and um...
Katie has a dance recital coming up.

22:57.469 --> 22:58.987
Oh right, I got the date in my phone.

22:59.007 --> 23:01.604
Great, yeah. Oh, and Georgie
has a trick-riding exhibition...

23:01.639 --> 23:04.207
In two weeks? I will be there for that.

23:04.241 --> 23:06.108
You got it. (Both chuckle)

23:08.045 --> 23:10.079
So, we talk about the summer?

23:10.113 --> 23:13.249
The summer. Right, okay.

23:13.283 --> 23:15.552
Okay. Um... listen,

23:15.586 --> 23:17.687
I totally get that you
wanna share your world

23:17.722 --> 23:20.723
with Georgie and Katie, but... (sighs)

23:22.392 --> 23:24.693
- But...?
- (Chuckles awkwardly) But...

23:24.728 --> 23:28.230
Um, just-you know,
if we're being reasonable,

23:28.264 --> 23:31.099
it's more reasonable for one adult male

23:31.133 --> 23:34.536
to fly from Vancouver to Calgary

23:34.571 --> 23:36.704
than it is for me to-to-to
organize the girls

23:36.739 --> 23:39.540
and then put them on a plane to you.

23:39.575 --> 23:41.476
And Katie, she's so young.

23:41.510 --> 23:43.444
I mean, she's gonna be
completely disoriented by it.

23:43.479 --> 23:44.846
No she won't. She won't.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.314
She'll be totally excited by it.

23:47.349 --> 23:49.417
Kids do this all the time, Lou.

23:49.451 --> 23:50.785
Okay, all right, of course.

23:50.819 --> 23:52.519
But I mean what about their routines,
their...

23:52.553 --> 23:54.554
New routines are good for kids.

23:54.589 --> 23:56.723
- They'll adapt. Kids always adapt.
- Yeah.

23:56.743 --> 23:57.652
You know that.

23:57.672 --> 23:59.393
'Cause all Georgie needs is to adapt again.

23:59.427 --> 24:01.795
Hey, Georgie and I are fine.

24:01.829 --> 24:03.530
She listens to me.

24:05.165 --> 24:06.666
(Sighs)

24:06.701 --> 24:09.369
Okay,
what're you gonna do while you're at work?

24:09.403 --> 24:11.771
I mean, you can't possibly be
taking the whole simmer off, right?

24:11.805 --> 24:14.072
I mean, you always talk about
how crazy long your hours are.

24:14.107 --> 24:15.408
Got that problem solved.

24:15.442 --> 24:17.410
My co-workers' daughter, Sylvia,

24:17.444 --> 24:19.278
said she'd love to work as
a nanny over the summer.

24:19.312 --> 24:21.714
It's perfect. And I'll definitely
have a couple of weeks off, so...

24:21.748 --> 24:25.317
So a complete stranger is gonna
be taking care of my girls?

24:26.990 --> 24:28.319
(Annoyed sigh) Our girls. Our girls.

24:28.353 --> 24:30.187
- Our...
- our girls.

24:30.222 --> 24:31.689
She's not a complete stranger.

24:31.724 --> 24:33.558
I have dinner with her
parent's all the time.

24:33.592 --> 24:36.494
- It's gonna be fine.
- Right. Right.

24:36.529 --> 24:39.531
I... can we just finish
talking about this tomorrow?

24:39.565 --> 24:42.233
- I'm really tired.
- Yeah.

24:42.267 --> 24:43.467
Sure, yeah, yeah. Get some sleep.

24:43.501 --> 24:45.536
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:45.570 --> 24:48.705
(Light kiss) - Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

24:48.740 --> 24:51.937
- (Sighs) Sleep well.
- Thank you. You too.

24:51.957 --> 24:55.145
(Door creaks open and closed)

25:03.219 --> 25:04.620
(Blows out her breath)

25:04.655 --> 25:08.658
(Low rumble of thunder,
wind howls, hail patters)

25:10.393 --> 25:13.863
What is that? (Hail batters roof)

25:13.897 --> 25:19.867
Agh! Hail. Oh my... it's hailing.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.937
(Hail batters roof)

25:21.971 --> 25:25.128
(Groans) You've got to be kidding me.

25:25.148 --> 25:28.343
I can't take another sleepless night.

25:29.814 --> 25:31.312
(Thunder rumbles loudly)- Oh man...
- Ugh...

25:31.347 --> 25:33.448
(Plastic rustles)

25:34.198 --> 25:36.717
Here we go. (Light clicks on)

25:36.751 --> 25:38.519
(Giggling)

25:42.473 --> 25:44.476
(Sighs) This is gonna be fun.

25:44.496 --> 25:46.908
Our first night in our new place!

25:46.928 --> 25:49.963
Do you believe it?

25:49.998 --> 25:51.765
- Looks comfy.
- Yeah.

25:51.799 --> 25:54.901
(Laughs)

25:54.935 --> 25:56.602
There.

26:01.641 --> 26:04.076
(Laughing)
Okay.

26:06.079 --> 26:09.747
(Light clicks off) Okay. (Laughing)

26:15.345 --> 26:18.380
(Horse whinnies loudly)

26:18.414 --> 26:21.282
(Loud bang, horse grunts)

26:21.316 --> 26:23.484
- Oh no.
- Oh...

26:23.519 --> 26:25.486
Oh my God, are you kidding me?!

26:25.521 --> 26:26.821
(Loud bang, Amy sighs)

26:26.856 --> 26:29.891
(Ty groans, horse whinnies)

26:29.925 --> 26:33.962
(High-pitched whinny, loud banging)

26:35.765 --> 26:38.598
(Grunting, banging against stall)

26:38.633 --> 26:40.600
It's okay, Bear. Settle down.

26:40.635 --> 26:42.502
You're okay, you're okay. Whoa!

26:42.537 --> 26:43.871
Easy, easy. I'm gonna put him outside.

26:43.905 --> 26:45.539
No, no, no. If he runs around,

26:45.573 --> 26:46.982
it could open up his wound, Amy.

26:47.002 --> 26:49.543
Yeah, but he might at least
calm down out there. Easy, boy.

26:49.577 --> 26:51.378
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Whoa, boy. Whoa.

26:51.412 --> 26:53.280
- He might not be used to being stalled.
- What's going on?

26:53.314 --> 26:55.614
He's just-he's just going
a little stir crazy.

26:55.649 --> 26:56.916
It's gonna be okay.
You're fine. Settle down.

26:56.950 --> 26:59.351
I heard him all the way across the yard.

26:59.386 --> 27:01.253
(Sighs)Hey, hey...

27:06.827 --> 27:09.762
So I um...
I couldn't really get to sleep last night

27:09.797 --> 27:12.597
and uh... I was thinking...

27:14.300 --> 27:19.204
that we're on the same
page about a lot of things,

27:19.238 --> 27:24.542
but we're obviously not on the
same page about everything.

27:24.577 --> 27:26.678
Right. I agree. Um...

27:29.114 --> 27:31.782
(Approaching footsteps)

27:31.817 --> 27:34.952
So maybe we should
discuss our expectations.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.421
Because I do wanna spend more
time with the girls, obviously,

27:37.455 --> 27:39.323
but not just here at Heartland.

27:39.357 --> 27:41.358
I get that.

27:41.392 --> 27:44.461
So maybe...

27:44.495 --> 27:47.396
Maybe the girls could go to Vancouver,

27:47.431 --> 27:49.565
but only when you have vacation.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.569
- No nanny.
- Okay, that's a start.

27:53.604 --> 27:55.605
So let's-let's run it by the girls?

27:55.639 --> 27:59.142
- All right. I will.
- Good.

28:00.644 --> 28:02.377
You know, we should also discuss a schedule

28:02.411 --> 28:06.749
that we're both comfortable
with for holidays, Christmas,

28:06.783 --> 28:09.651
all that, you know,
visitation rights kind of stuff.

28:09.685 --> 28:11.787
Visitation rights?

28:11.821 --> 28:13.122
I thought that we were doing this

28:13.156 --> 28:15.624
without "all that visitation rights stuff."

28:15.658 --> 28:17.159
I thought that...

28:17.193 --> 28:19.393
that we were doing fine
without the lawyers,

28:19.427 --> 28:21.362
and the formal separation agreement.

28:21.396 --> 28:22.730
No, no, no, we are fine without lawyers

28:22.765 --> 28:24.565
or formal agreements,
but we do need to be clear

28:24.599 --> 28:26.367
about what we both expect moving forward.

28:26.401 --> 28:28.803
(Snorts) You sound like you're
carving out a business deal.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.772
No, you know it's not like that.

28:30.806 --> 28:32.373
Look, just-why don't you...

28:32.407 --> 28:34.809
write down everything that
you don't want to happen

28:34.843 --> 28:36.243
and then make a list of all the things

28:36.277 --> 28:37.644
that you're okay with,

28:37.678 --> 28:38.979
and we'll just take it from there.

28:39.013 --> 28:41.281
- Sounds like a plan.
- All right then.

28:41.315 --> 28:43.616
See? We're good at this!

28:43.651 --> 28:44.985
I'm gonna go get ready for this meeting.

28:45.019 --> 28:46.719
'Kay.

28:46.754 --> 28:49.622
(Receding footsteps)

28:51.692 --> 28:54.693
(Bear grunts and whinnies, agitated)

28:57.530 --> 28:59.364
Easy now. (Bear grunts)

28:59.399 --> 29:02.935
He wants out. (Bear grunts)

29:02.969 --> 29:06.138
Remember when he waited for me to
put the halter and lead rope on?

29:06.173 --> 29:08.340
He wanted to be caught and
he was telling us that.

29:08.374 --> 29:09.775
It's the same thing now.

29:09.809 --> 29:12.210
He's still trying to tell us something.

29:12.244 --> 29:13.511
Georgie, he's just feeling some
pain from his wound right now.

29:13.545 --> 29:14.979
He's a little wound up.

29:15.014 --> 29:18.249
(Truck rumbles to a halt,
Bear grunts and whinnies)

29:20.152 --> 29:22.620
Okay. You still wanna work? (Door opens)

29:24.456 --> 29:26.057
Or are you all involved with that horse?

29:26.091 --> 29:27.291
(Door slams shut)

29:27.325 --> 29:30.660
Again, it's okay.
I'm fine working on my own,

29:30.695 --> 29:34.298
so you do whatever it
is that you have to do.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.602
- He's killing me right now!
- I know.

29:43.507 --> 29:46.309
(Hooves thud, Bear grunts)

29:46.343 --> 29:50.279
- We have to let him out.
- Let him out? Why?

29:50.314 --> 29:52.815
Yeah,
just to see where he goes when he's free.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.851
Georgie, he's still recovering

29:54.885 --> 29:56.585
and besides, he was attacked once.

29:56.619 --> 29:58.487
Who's to say that bear's
not still out there?

29:58.521 --> 30:00.823
Well, I don't care. He's freaking out.

30:00.857 --> 30:02.858
It-it's the right thing to do!
I can feel it in my gut.

30:02.892 --> 30:06.361
No. Okay? Just no, and I mean it.

30:06.395 --> 30:08.997
(Engine starts)

30:12.601 --> 30:14.736
(SUV rumbles)

30:18.473 --> 30:20.674
(Horn honks, SUV rumbles)

30:24.145 --> 30:26.247
(Birds chirp outside)

30:28.149 --> 30:30.817
(Keyboard keys tap)

30:36.590 --> 30:39.425
(Sighs heavily, Door creaks open and shut)

30:39.459 --> 30:40.960
(Laptop snaps shut)

30:40.995 --> 30:44.563
Hey! How's the horse doing?

30:44.598 --> 30:46.900
What's going on?

30:46.934 --> 30:51.937
Nothing's going on. I...
I just got something in my eye.

30:51.971 --> 30:55.240
I'm not a kid. You're acting all strange.

30:55.275 --> 30:58.243
No I'm not, Georgie. Everything's fine.

30:58.278 --> 31:00.678
Don't say that. You're acting all... fake,

31:00.713 --> 31:02.281
and you're "smiley" all the time.

31:02.315 --> 31:04.716
Georgie, I'm not acting fake.

31:04.750 --> 31:08.387
And why does everyone keep saying I'm
"smiley"?

31:10.455 --> 31:13.925
Okay, fine. Maybe we've...

31:13.959 --> 31:16.260
I've been trying a bit too hard lately,

31:16.295 --> 31:20.664
but it's better to be calm
and reasonable than... not.

31:22.034 --> 31:26.436
We've all seen the alternative
and it's not pretty.

31:26.470 --> 31:27.804
But it's all good,

31:27.838 --> 31:29.339
because your dad has a great idea

31:29.373 --> 31:32.375
and I think you're gonna be really excited.

31:32.410 --> 31:36.879
He wants you and Katie to go and spend some
time with him, this summer, in Vancouver.

31:36.914 --> 31:39.482
I can't.

31:39.516 --> 31:41.617
I have Extreme Team. I have to be here.

31:41.652 --> 31:44.653
Well, I'm sure we can work something out.

31:44.687 --> 31:46.788
It might only be for a couple of weeks.

31:46.823 --> 31:50.359
I have shows every week.
No, I-I'm not going.

31:50.393 --> 31:54.229
It isn't always our decision to make,
Georgie.

31:54.264 --> 31:57.232
You know, we all have to compromise and...

31:57.267 --> 31:59.634
So you're not okay with this either,
are you?

31:59.669 --> 32:01.469
Yes, I am.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.238
I think it'll be... an adventure.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.676
Look, Georgie,
the point is your dad has a right

32:08.710 --> 32:10.478
to want you to visit him there,

32:10.512 --> 32:12.780
and... and I'm trying to be fair, okay?

32:12.814 --> 32:16.917
I'm trying to be good at this.
I'm trying really, really hard.

32:16.952 --> 32:18.452
Well, don't!

32:18.486 --> 32:20.687
Just tell Dad it's not happening!

32:20.721 --> 32:22.655
But I want you to spend time with him.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.458
And so do I, but...

32:24.492 --> 32:27.027
not in Vancouver and not in the summer!

32:27.061 --> 32:29.296
Just tell him.

32:29.330 --> 32:30.763
You used to tell him stuff,
whether he liked it or not!

32:30.798 --> 32:32.232
I liked it better when you were fighting.

32:32.266 --> 32:34.367
At least you were honest!

32:40.640 --> 32:42.074
(Sighs)

32:43.977 --> 32:46.778
You said that the drain
for the tub should go here;

32:46.813 --> 32:49.715
that's why I put the hole right...

32:49.749 --> 32:52.269
Here. The drain goes here. I said it twice.

32:52.289 --> 32:53.732
Okay, you know what, Tim?

32:53.752 --> 32:55.920
You don't want my help,
you don't think I know that?

32:55.954 --> 32:58.323
I'm sorry my work isn't
up to your standards.

32:58.357 --> 32:59.657
Oh, oh, c'mon, c'mon.

32:59.691 --> 33:01.759
Hey, hey, don't be so sensitive, Ty.

33:01.793 --> 33:03.928
I never wanted you to have
total responsibility for this,

33:03.962 --> 33:06.297
and you're not going to.
I'm gonna hire an electrician.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.698
Electrical's done,
I told you that already, and it's to code.

33:08.733 --> 33:10.700
Then I'm gonna hire a plumber!

33:10.735 --> 33:12.869
I should've done it in the first place.
I'm calling him now.

33:12.904 --> 33:14.871
Yeah, fine, you call.
Yeah, throw your money away.

33:14.906 --> 33:17.574
I'm not throwing my money away, Tim.

33:17.608 --> 33:19.910
We're gonna get this done,

33:19.944 --> 33:21.969
and I never should've let you have the
idea that you could do this by yourself,

33:21.989 --> 33:24.248
'cause you can't. It's too big a job.

33:27.651 --> 33:30.486
(Footsteps thud on stairs)

33:30.521 --> 33:32.510
Well, he's right.

33:32.530 --> 33:34.615
You can't do this on your own.

33:35.692 --> 33:37.626
You're way over your head here, Tim,

33:37.661 --> 33:39.562
and that's why you've been putting it off

33:39.596 --> 33:42.864
and putting it off.
I have not been putting it off.

33:42.898 --> 33:45.567
I haven't been putting off, Jack, I'm busy!

33:45.601 --> 33:47.001
I got a rodeo school, I have clinics,

33:47.036 --> 33:48.903
I'm helping Lou at Maggie's
every once in while,

33:48.938 --> 33:50.763
and there's Casey!
I'm trying to keep a relationship...

33:50.783 --> 33:53.481
Well,
then why did you even take this project on?

33:53.501 --> 33:56.378
Because I wanted to help them.

33:56.837 --> 33:59.447
I told them I'd help them.

33:59.865 --> 34:02.249
And I-I promised them, Jack. (Loud thump)

34:02.284 --> 34:04.185
Okay.

34:06.020 --> 34:09.177
Fact remains... just...

34:09.858 --> 34:12.125
we've got to get going on this.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.127
And I don't care what you say,

34:14.161 --> 34:16.896
I'm giving you a hand,
and so is that young man.

34:16.929 --> 34:20.399
He wants this for Amy
as much as you and I do.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.668
The first thing we're gonna do
is get the plumbing finished.

34:22.703 --> 34:25.838
We don't need a plumber to do that,
so go tell Ty.

34:25.873 --> 34:30.376
No. I'll tell Ty. (Receding footsteps)

34:31.777 --> 34:34.344
(Harness rattles)

34:34.380 --> 34:36.347
(Phoenix and Trouble grunt and whinny)

34:36.382 --> 34:38.750
Come on, Trouble. Stay beside Phoenix.

34:38.784 --> 34:40.685
(Hooves thud)

34:42.889 --> 34:44.322
Hup! Come on!

34:45.658 --> 34:48.793
(Hooves thunder) Hold! Whoa, slow down.

34:50.762 --> 34:52.663
Speed up. Ungh!

34:55.333 --> 34:57.367
(Struggling grunts) Trouble!

34:59.905 --> 35:02.205
(Grunting) Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:04.175 --> 35:06.877
Trouble, you have to stay with Phoenix!

35:06.912 --> 35:08.745
It's not gonna work if you don't.

35:08.779 --> 35:12.148
Don't worry, Georgie, they'll get it.

35:12.182 --> 35:14.283
(Sighs) They're driving me crazy.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.822
(Disbelieving Laugh) Lou,
you can't be serious with this.

35:19.857 --> 35:21.123
What did you do, just go on the internet

35:21.158 --> 35:22.592
and find samples of separation agreements

35:22.626 --> 35:24.126
and cobble this together?

35:24.161 --> 35:26.361
Peter, I had to start somewhere.

35:26.395 --> 35:30.632
Okay. Um, well, first of all,
I don't have any quibbles

35:30.667 --> 35:34.036
with retirement savings funds,
support payments

35:34.070 --> 35:37.172
or anything to do with division
of assets or money. Okay.

35:37.206 --> 35:39.240
But my kids have to come
and spend time with me.

35:39.275 --> 35:41.054
You understand that, right?

35:41.074 --> 35:42.978
My life with them can't be
totally bound with Heartland.

35:42.998 --> 35:44.355
This is where they go to school,

35:44.375 --> 35:45.671
have their lessons, their friends.

35:45.691 --> 35:48.315
Okay, so joint custody is fine with
you as long as it's on your turf.

35:48.349 --> 35:50.685
That is not what I'm saying here...

35:50.719 --> 35:53.253
- That's exactly what you're saying.
- No! I...

35:53.665 --> 35:56.090
This was supposed to be just about
Vancouver and this summer, Lou.

35:56.124 --> 35:59.292
Yeah,
well you turned it into more than that!

35:59.326 --> 36:02.328
Okay, well, I can't accept this, okay?

36:02.362 --> 36:04.831
Well then, you know what,
maybe we were wrong.

36:04.865 --> 36:07.078
Maybe we're not fine.

36:07.934 --> 36:10.236
And...
maybe we need some professional help.

36:10.270 --> 36:12.839
Yup, maybe you're right,

36:12.873 --> 36:14.708
because we obviously
aren't dealing with this

36:14.742 --> 36:16.742
in a constructive manner anymore, so.

36:16.776 --> 36:18.644
I'll just go get packed.
I'm gonna go to the airport.

36:18.678 --> 36:21.213
- Go to the airport.
- (Laughs bitterly) Yeah.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.015
Maybe just send it to my Lawyer, I guess.

36:23.049 --> 36:25.584
- Fine, I will.
- Great.

36:36.636 --> 36:38.435
(Grunting)

36:44.609 --> 36:46.510
(Sighs heavily)

36:46.545 --> 36:49.047
(Grunting)

36:54.118 --> 36:58.055
(Grunting, hooves thud heavily)

37:12.069 --> 37:14.804
(Gate latch clanks, Bear grunts)

37:16.206 --> 37:18.240
Georgie?! Hey!

37:18.274 --> 37:19.709
What're you doing?

37:19.743 --> 37:22.511
He wanted out, so I'm gonna follow him.

37:22.545 --> 37:24.013
(Sighs)

37:24.047 --> 37:26.048
(Grunting)

37:29.752 --> 37:32.120
Are you okay?

37:34.023 --> 37:37.792
All right, we'll follow him. (Sighs)

37:40.629 --> 37:43.832
(Hooves thunder)

37:50.705 --> 37:53.974
(Water flows, hooves clop)

37:56.677 --> 37:58.045
(Water splashes)

37:58.079 --> 38:01.348
(Hooves clop, water splashes)

38:07.821 --> 38:11.523
(Hooves clop, water splashes)

38:14.128 --> 38:17.864
(Hooves thud)

38:19.331 --> 38:21.466
(Hooves thud, horses snort)

38:23.435 --> 38:25.137
Oh... whoa.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.007
He's waiting for us.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.943
(Horse whinnies in the distance)

38:31.978 --> 38:34.445
Did you hear that?

38:34.480 --> 38:39.449
(Water flows, hooves thud)

38:39.484 --> 38:43.087
(Bear grunts)

38:43.121 --> 38:46.157
(Phoenix and Spartan grunt,
horses whinnies)

38:55.532 --> 38:58.101
(Horses whinny, Georgie laughs)

38:59.804 --> 39:01.938
That's why he wanted out.

39:03.473 --> 39:05.608
(Laughing)

39:05.642 --> 39:07.743
(Running footsteps)

39:08.779 --> 39:10.380
Okay.

39:11.580 --> 39:14.149
Ready. Okay, let's see what we got.

39:14.184 --> 39:16.518
(Bucket rattles)

39:16.552 --> 39:20.055
Go ahead.

39:20.089 --> 39:23.692
(Faucet squeaks, water flows)

39:23.726 --> 39:26.128
(Water squirts and flows hard)

39:27.629 --> 39:29.163
(Pipes rattle)

39:29.198 --> 39:31.032
That's it, just wait.

39:32.767 --> 39:34.768
(Gurgling)

39:39.641 --> 39:42.844
(Water drips and pours) There it is.

39:42.878 --> 39:47.780
(Excited gasp and laughter)

39:49.483 --> 39:51.084
Oh hey, Amy!

39:53.154 --> 39:58.158
(Yelling) Hey, Amy! We got water! (Laughs)

40:02.727 --> 40:05.023
Hey, Buddy. You will be okay.

40:05.046 --> 40:07.447
Buddy. I like it. Bear and Buddy.

40:07.481 --> 40:09.282
(Running footsteps) We did it! (Laughs)

40:09.317 --> 40:11.384
That's great. Um...

40:11.418 --> 40:15.355
This horse, severe case of rain rot.

40:15.389 --> 40:18.058
Oh no. Well, that's really contagious.

40:18.092 --> 40:20.492
We gotta quarantine him
from the other horses.

40:20.526 --> 40:22.361
But him and Bear just found each other.

40:22.395 --> 40:24.230
Do we have to separate them?

40:24.264 --> 40:25.865
We don't have a choice, Georgie.

40:25.899 --> 40:29.935
- I'll go get my kit.
- Okay, I'll set up a stall for him.

40:34.474 --> 40:37.408
Are you sure about this, Lou?

40:37.442 --> 40:39.143
You guys were doing so well.

40:39.178 --> 40:42.613
We weren't, Grandpa. We... really weren't.

40:42.647 --> 40:46.617
- But lawyers...?
- Please... just don't say anything.
