00:06.574 --> 00:09.009
I looked it up online.
It's hemorrhoids.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.147
Hmm.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.417
That's your diagnosis?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.186
Who should we listen to?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.688
The doctor, or the guy
with the inflamed ass

00:20.754 --> 00:22.556
and the Internet
connection? Hmm.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.227
All right, WebMD-bag.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.631
Based on your symptoms,

00:30.698 --> 00:32.300
I'm recommending
a colonoscopy.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.667
What? Colonoscopy?

00:33.734 --> 00:35.803
Hey, relax
with the upsell, buddy.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.037
It's a hemorrhoid.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.872
(MOCKINGLY)
"It's a hemorrhoid, uh."

00:40.341 --> 00:42.410
You would know,
since your head's up your ass.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.212
(LAUGHS)

00:44.278 --> 00:46.280
That was a good one.
Hold on a second.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.515
Go to hell!

00:47.581 --> 00:49.550
It's just a little hemorrhoid!

00:50.851 --> 00:51.919
(MOCKINGLY) "Go to hell!

00:51.985 --> 00:53.154
"It's just

Man, I love that guy.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.190
Oh, my god.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.627
I'm so stressed out.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.263
These patients are such whiny,
complaining bitches.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.233
You know what I mean?

01:05.299 --> 01:08.536
Yes, I know
exactly what you mean.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.372
Um, what do you think
might alleviate your stress?

01:11.439 --> 01:13.341
Well, for starters,
my wife could help.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.042
In what way?

01:15.109 --> 01:17.111
Well, she could conduct
the rest of this session
with her top off.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.179
We could see where it goes.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.182
I only do that
for paying customers.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.220

Thank you, Nina.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.564
Ken, what is wrong with you?

01:36.630 --> 01:39.099
You know, Molly's got
her driver's test today,

01:39.167 --> 01:41.269
and I'm, like, so nervous.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.736
What if she doesn't fail?

01:44.705 --> 01:45.706
(SIGHS)

01:45.773 --> 01:47.040
Look at her.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.311
She's our baby girl,
and cars are death machines.

01:50.378 --> 01:53.881
You said the same thing
about tricycles,
seesaws, and puppies.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.786
Puppies grow up to be dogs,
dogs eventually die.

01:58.852 --> 02:02.490
Broken heart, drug abuse,
prostitution, death.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.125
Wow.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.461
The day I got my license,
I was so excited.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.596
I was waving to a buddy,

02:08.662 --> 02:10.764
and I drove straight
into a parked car.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.066
But she's not you.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.003
I know.
She's like me but popular.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.639
We have the same
number of hands,

02:18.706 --> 02:21.909
but she has way more
people to wave to.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.312
She's growing up. We got
to give her some freedom.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.046
Kids don't need freedom.
They need...

02:26.113 --> 02:28.516
(SIGHS) What's
the opposite of freedom?
Duct tape!

02:28.582 --> 02:31.719
They need.
To be taped. Down.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.287
Oh, my god.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.522
You sound like your father.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.825
(LAUGHS) No, I don't.
My father sounds like this.

And now you're
in a box? Really?

03:42.823 --> 03:45.493
Dave?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.429
Every kid does one thing
in school that they're
defined by,

03:48.496 --> 03:50.998
and you really don't
want yours to be mime,

03:52.866 --> 03:54.768
because that is
an invisible box

03:54.835 --> 03:56.704
that you cannot get out of.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.041
Oh, you showed Dad
your mime act?

thinks it's lame.

think it's lame.

let this happen.

happy for me, Dad.

Oh, Molly, if it seems
like I'm not happy,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.108
it's only because I'm not.

happy, can you be quiet?

tomorrow night,

take Dad's convertible.

your car tomorrow night?

Sure. I think there's...
No, need that one, too.

all the ways

What about the parade?

06:13.941 --> 06:17.177
Well, they're
expecting rain, and...

06:17.244 --> 06:19.346
It was fake, so...

06:20.481 --> 06:21.549
Thanks, Dad.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.983
On three conditions.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.753
Number one,
no texting while driving.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.256
Why would I increase
my chances
of an accident by 46%?

06:31.692 --> 06:34.462
And the rearview mirror
isn't for applying makeup.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.963
It's for safety.

True, but you can't just
rely on the rearview.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.267

Blind spots. Duh.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.638

teach you in Driver's Ed.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.509
If you see a friend
while driving,

06:48.576 --> 06:51.278
do not,
under any circumstances, wave.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.648
Dad, please,
no one waves anymore.

Really?
No.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.452
Hmm. (STUTTERING)

Uh, where are you
going tomorrow night?

07:06.226 --> 07:08.929
Oh, just... Studying
over at Avery's.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.831
Avery, huh?
What happened to Tammy?

07:10.898 --> 07:13.133
Uh, Tammy's Tammy,
but Avery is Avery,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.635
and Tammy could never
be Avery, but if Avery wanted,

07:14.702 --> 07:17.037
she could easily be Tammy,
like, nine times over.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.676
Okay, why would Avery
want to be Tammy?

07:22.743 --> 07:26.413
No, Dad, no one
wants to be Tammy.
Except Whitney. Ugh.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.455
So, Allison was all like,
"We got to lock her down!"

07:35.523 --> 07:39.426
And I was like, "No, we got
to give her some freedom."

07:40.794 --> 07:43.296
There is no way
it went down like that.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.665
She's right.

07:44.732 --> 07:48.401
Look, I did give Molly
the car, but it is killing me.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.237
Oh, don't let it, Dr. Park.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.872
Molly seems like a good kid.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.240
You're right. She is.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.943
She's just going to a friend's
house to study. No bigs.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.179
"Friend's house to study?"
Mmm-hmm.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.081
What? You don't believe
that's where she's going?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.216
Oh, no,
that's every girl's dream.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.053
To get her license
so she can drive to her
friend's house to study.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.422
She's right.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.892
When I got my license,
I drove straight from the DMV

08:11.959 --> 08:14.762
to Varsha Patel's house
to crush some calculus.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.599
(LAUGHING)
We were so crazy back then.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.771
Well, I trust my daughter,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.405
and if she says
she's studying,
that's where she is.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.875
Aw, that is so sweet!

08:27.941 --> 08:29.342
Did you see
that episode of 20/20?

08:29.409 --> 08:31.411
Where that girl borrowed
a car and got abducted?

08:31.478 --> 08:32.813
Yes!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.848
Or that Nightline where
the little 15-year-old girl

08:34.915 --> 08:37.284
gets all mixed up in some
crazy stuff on Craigslist?

08:37.350 --> 08:38.819
Yes!

08:38.886 --> 08:41.655
Or literally any episode
of Law & Order: SVU.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.056
Yes!

08:44.925 --> 08:48.629
Wait, guys, I know
that there are some disturbing

08:48.696 --> 08:50.931
and repetitive
shows out there,

08:50.998 --> 08:53.801
but Dr. Park doesn't have
proof that his daughter

08:53.867 --> 08:55.368
isn't where she said she is.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.905
If it's proof he wants,
there is an app for that.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.940
An app?
An app to track
your daughter.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.109
Really? What's it called?
"Daughter Tracker."

09:04.377 --> 09:05.679
You want me
to download it for you?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.149
I... I don't know,
all right?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.518
I promised Allison
I'd trust Molly.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.821
You know, but she has been
hanging out with Avery,

09:13.887 --> 09:17.257
who may or may not be Tammy.
Or possibly Whitney!

09:19.226 --> 09:21.128
I mean, I guess it would be
good to know where she is.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.263
Oh, no, no, Dr. Ken!

09:23.330 --> 09:25.766
If she finds out
that you're secretly
tracking her whereabouts,

09:25.833 --> 09:28.368
she will never
trust you again.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.938
Yeah, it is nice to have
a daughter who trusts you.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.806
Thank you.
You know what else is nice?

09:32.873 --> 09:34.307
Having a daughter
who's alive!

09:35.643 --> 09:36.777
Download it.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.679
No, no, don't! It's wrong!

09:38.746 --> 09:39.813
I can't do it.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.949
Oh, thank God!
Someone with a conscience!

09:42.015 --> 09:43.183
I need your pass code.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.425
Does it say anything yet?

09:52.492 --> 09:54.728
It looks like
she's in a storage container
headed for Thailand!

09:54.795 --> 09:57.197
(SHRIEKING) What?
Just messing with you!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.866
It's still downloading.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.002
Ken.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.672
Could I steal you
for a quick powwow?

10:04.738 --> 10:06.439
And, everybody else,
if you could just pretend

10:06.506 --> 10:09.442
to be busy
while you listen in,
that'd be super.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.612
Hey, Ken, do you
remember that patient

10:12.680 --> 10:14.915
you offended yesterday?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.384
You know, the gentleman
with the buttocks circumstance

10:17.450 --> 10:19.086
who's now threatening
to sue the HMO?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.821
Whoa, whoa.
He's threatening to sue?

10:20.888 --> 10:22.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I can't say as I blame him.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.624
I mean, I saw the tape.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.594
Oh, FYI, we've installed
security cameras
throughout the clinic.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.162
it's gonna save us
$5 million

10:29.229 --> 10:31.131
on malpractice premiums
this decade alone.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.266
$5 million?
What do we get with all that?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.502
Nothing.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.938
Anywho, speaking
of malpractice...

10:38.005 --> 10:40.440
Pat, the man needs
a colonoscopy.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.375
With no due respect,

10:42.442 --> 10:44.344
you're an administrator,
not a doctor.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.413
Damn right, I'm not.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.381
While you were wasting
eight years of your life
in medical school,

10:48.448 --> 10:52.019
I was managing
three Circuit City's
to record profits.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.455
"The Mayor"
is what some called me.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.190
You know,
because it's a city.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.559
Circuit City, you know?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.261
And the mayor's
in charge of the city, so...

11:01.328 --> 11:03.964
Well, you know,
the point is, Ken,

11:04.031 --> 11:06.633
that if we lose money,
you will not have
the resources you need

11:06.700 --> 11:07.968
to treat your patients.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.003
And I'm assuming
no diversity brunch.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.239
Damona, I know you want
to have a diversity brunch,

11:12.305 --> 11:14.141
but, let's face it,
you're in the minority.

11:16.143 --> 11:19.112
And I will give you
two extra vacation days
if you don't report that.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.481
All right.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.117
And you are going
to apologize to the customer

11:24.184 --> 11:25.685
until he agrees
to drop the lawsuit.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.654
And if I don't?
Then I will
finally have grounds

11:27.721 --> 11:29.289
to fire your tiny,
Asian ass.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.261
Okay, two more
vacation days
for everybody.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.198
What are you gonna do?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.900
I'm not apologizing
to anyone.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.402
If anything, Pat should
be apologizing to us.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.670
Spying on people?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.739
That is oppressive
and intrusive.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.307
Unless it's your
own daughter?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.977
Julie, no one wants to hear
your valid point right now.

(CHUCKLES)
It's not good, is it?

20:19.286 --> 20:22.188
(LAUGHS)
No, it's a train wreck.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.724

20:53.085 --> 20:55.988
