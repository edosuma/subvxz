00:11.160 --> 00:13.200
<i>Thirty seconds and counting.</i>

00:13.240 --> 00:15.000
<i>Power transfer is complete.</i>

00:15.400 --> 00:18.560
<i>We're on internal power
with the launch vehicle at this time.</i>

00:18.640 --> 00:20.760
<i>T minus 20 seconds and counting.</i>

00:20.840 --> 00:23.040
<i>All the second-stage
tanks now pressurised.</i>

00:23.120 --> 00:25.850
<i>T minus 15 seconds. Guidance is internal.</i>

00:26.480 --> 00:29.680
<i>Twelve, eleven, ten, 9...</i>

00:30.240 --> 00:32.000
<i>Ignition sequence starts.</i>

00:32.680 --> 00:37.520
<i>Six, five, four, three, two, one,</i>

00:38.520 --> 00:40.360
<i>zero. All engines running.</i>

00:41.120 --> 00:43.280
<i>Lift off! We have a lift off.</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:45.560
<i>And so in 1972,</i>

00:46.040 --> 00:49.520
<i>the Atlas Centaur rocket
blasted off from our planet,</i>

00:50.200 --> 00:53.120
<i>a four-stage rocket that launched a probe</i>

00:53.200 --> 00:55.240
<i>way out into the blackness of space.</i>

00:55.720 --> 00:58.000
<i>The probe would use
the energy from the sun</i>

00:58.080 --> 01:01.200
<i>and the gravitational pull
of our neighbouring planets</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:02.770
<i>to cross our solar system.</i>

01:02.960 --> 01:05.239
<i>That momentum would then carry it on</i>

01:05.319 --> 01:07.680
<i>into the farthest reaches of the universe.</i>

01:08.760 --> 01:12.400
<i>The mission, to find intelligent life
similar to ours</i>

01:13.160 --> 01:15.120
<i>out there in deep space.</i>

01:16.120 --> 01:19.040
<i>The probe carried a tablet
which had inscribed on it</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:21.640
<i>the image of us humans, a man and a woman,</i>

01:21.720 --> 01:23.400
<i>and a map to locate us in the universe.</i>

01:24.440 --> 01:28.840
<i>Stage four disconnects and our probe
is fired on its long journey.</i>

01:29.400 --> 01:31.560
<i>The world wished it bon voyage</i>

01:32.080 --> 01:34.760
<i>and may it find a friend out there</i>

01:34.840 --> 01:36.520
<i>in deep space.</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:16.600
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.800
Hey! Thank you very much. Thank you.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.480
Thank you, nice to see you.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.160
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.760
When I interviewed Neil Clarke
for <i>The Book Programme,</i>

03:34.840 --> 03:36.410
I knew he was extraordinary.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.290
Now, with the publication
of his brilliant novel,

03:40.360 --> 03:42.240
reviewers agree he's joined the ranks

03:42.320 --> 03:44.000
of Britain's immortals.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.570
Ladies and gentlemen, Neil Clarke.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.810
Um, so I suppose I wanted to start off
by asking you

03:55.920 --> 03:59.810
how did you manage such amazing
insight into the soul of modern man

03:59.880 --> 04:02.530
and how do you know
what men and women really want,

04:03.520 --> 04:07.040
just really the whole relationship
between humanity and the cosmos?

04:07.360 --> 04:10.250
Yeah, well,
I think I probably achieved that

04:10.400 --> 04:13.000
by looking into my own soul, Catherine.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.800
Um, I studied its flaws,

04:15.880 --> 04:18.399
its potential, its urgent needs.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.000
I listened to its cries for help...

04:21.839 --> 04:26.200
and its yelps of anguish and, um, I...

04:27.440 --> 04:29.240
I spent five long years

04:29.320 --> 04:34.000
in a book which I hoped would throw open
the doors of human perception

04:34.080 --> 04:37.920
and allow us to be engulfed
in a sense of our own futility.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.120
Sorry about this, it's...

04:43.520 --> 04:45.520
Get off! Down!

04:48.080 --> 04:49.410
Ah!

04:53.320 --> 04:54.890
Oh, God.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.200
Go watch TV.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.130
Your dog is barking.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.440
My dog was barking
because you rang the doorbell.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.280
I rang the doorbell
because your dog was barking.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.600
Your lease says no pets.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.880
Well, he is a guide dog.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.400
You're not blind.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.050
I prefer the term "optically challenged".

05:19.200 --> 05:22.040
You're not optically challenged, either.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.240
Fiona, you live, like, three floors up.
I mean, I don't...

05:24.320 --> 05:27.840
If you don't
control your bloody dog,

05:27.920 --> 05:31.280
I am going to get it sent
to Battersea Dogs Home. Right?

05:32.080 --> 05:33.360
- Hmm?
- All right.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.760
Come on, Dennis,
let's go and evacuate your bowels.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.240
Come on, Dennis.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.760
Come on.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.200
- Hi, Neil.
- Hi, Catherine.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.640
Hey, it's funny,
I was just dreaming about you.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.360
Really?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.640
Yeah, you were presenting me
with an award for my novel.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.200
Oh, did you deserve it?

06:00.720 --> 06:02.600
Well, I was proud but humble.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.320
Have you finished it,
actually, in real life?

06:06.040 --> 06:08.080
Absolutely, almost, yeah.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.480
Cos last spring you were on chapter...

06:10.560 --> 06:12.880
Yeah, I've renumbered them.
In fact, I've removed them.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.040
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.640
I find the whole concept of chapters
just gets in the way so...

06:17.400 --> 06:19.640
Yeah. Yeah, no, I can see that.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.640
I want reading it to be like being
sucked into a giant vortex, you know.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.440
- Like going on Facebook.
- Like Facebook, yeah.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.800
That's a good one.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.800
"Like being sucked into a giant vortex."

06:34.880 --> 06:38.520
Dennis, why do you let me
say things like this, hey?

06:39.680 --> 06:40.800
Come on.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.400
Hmm. Mmm?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.610
Ah.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.880
- Come on, Ray. It's only 20 quid.
- No, I can't, Neil.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.200
- Yeah, but it can't lose.
- No.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.960
Look, I guarantee you
a 50% return on your money

08:25.080 --> 08:26.410
before the end of classes today.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.090
So when do you make your move on
Miss Booker Prize downstairs, then?

08:32.159 --> 08:36.370
Oh, I don't. Turns out she's a bit
literal-minded, no foresight.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.960
Whereas me,
I can see for miles into the future.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.520
A man needs a woman, Neil.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.280
- I've got Dennis.
- Dennis is male.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.040
And he's a dog, in case you hadn't noticed.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.240
Yeah, well,
I don't want to complicate my life.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.560
This is a tenner!

08:54.720 --> 08:55.840
Walk!

09:15.960 --> 09:19.720
<i>Accessing representative images
of earthlings.</i>

09:38.160 --> 09:42.130
Communication will be carried on in the
language of the species to be judged.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.850
I'm sorry, I'm not understanding.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.840
Ah.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.840
- Is that better, Kylie?
- Understanding you now, Sharon.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.520
By the power invested in me by the
Intergalactic Council of Superior Species,

09:56.600 --> 10:00.600
I hereby pronounce
a destruction order on the planet Earth.

10:00.680 --> 10:04.890
With great respect, Sharon,
we should not pronounce a destruction order

10:05.200 --> 10:08.520
before we've given these earthlings
a chance to prove themselves.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.490
They've penetrated
intergalactic space.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.800
Maureen is right.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.000
They're clearly not a superior species.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.330
Look at the way they copulate.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.280
If these earthlings

10:22.360 --> 10:26.410
can convince us that they are superior
beings, then they may join our society.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.400
If they cannot, we must eliminate them,

10:28.520 --> 10:32.080
for the moral well-being of the entire
Intergalactic Community.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.080
Thank you for explaining it to me, Sharon.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.320
Not at all, Miss Barker.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.800
No, Grant, I don't want to talk to you.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.720
No, I don't want to see you, either.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.120
We had a great time last
summer but it's over.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.930
What part of over do you not understand?

10:48.040 --> 10:49.690
Thank you for calling. Goodbye.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.960
These questions of yours
make it sound as if I thought

10:54.120 --> 10:56.400
this bloody author
can string two words together.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.080
But he can. It's a wonderful book.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.130
Darling, didn't you read the memo?
We're doing a demolition job.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.850
But it's the best thing he's ever written.
Everyone says so.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.320
That's why we have to pee on it
from a great height.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.450
I want ten new questions,
please, before noon.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.280
Don't you know? She never reads the books.
She hates books.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.370
Why is she presenting
a book programme, then?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.960
I spy trouble. Just...

11:29.760 --> 11:33.160
Look, Catherine, you may despise her ego,

11:33.240 --> 11:35.720
but that's what people tune in to see.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.840
Not books, not authors, God forbid,

11:39.880 --> 11:42.920
but Fenella's rampant, pulsating,
sexually arousing ego.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.440
No, I think people watch because
it's a book programme and they love books.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.170
Books are finished.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.720
Our job is to provide scandal, gossip
and character assassination,

11:52.800 --> 11:55.320
with a thin veneer of
literary respectability.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.400
Oh, so we're not just selling out, then?
We've sold out?

11:57.480 --> 11:58.520
Exactly.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.480
For God's sake, smile.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.080
It's enough to make you weep, isn't it?

12:29.440 --> 12:30.480
What?

12:31.920 --> 12:34.650
The price of pickles.
Don't even look at the marinated herring.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.240
Honestly, you'd be suicidal.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.560
I didn't want them, anyway.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.040
Thanks.

12:47.320 --> 12:51.120
Um, I also offer support and counselling
on dips, dried fruit and pasta sauces.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.330
She's gone.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.450
- The usual test, Sharon?
- The usual test, Kylie.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.480
One earthling will be chosen randomly,

13:07.760 --> 13:11.080
as defined by
the Intergalactic Manual of Good and Evil.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.000
Page 56. paragraph B.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.560
Uh, page 56, paragraph D.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.010
Uh, right.

13:19.480 --> 13:24.240
To prove that they understand
the difference between good and evil.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.320
How will they prove it?

13:26.400 --> 13:29.520
They will be given the power
that all superior beings have.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.570
The earthling will be capable
of doing absolutely anything.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.440
What if he uses his power for evil?

13:37.040 --> 13:39.690
The Earth will be eliminated.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.330
But if he uses it for good?

13:41.400 --> 13:44.240
Then we welcome them
to the Intergalactic Community.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.560
Are we ready, gentlemen?

13:46.400 --> 13:49.130
<i>Commencing random
selection of earthlings.</i>

13:50.480 --> 13:51.810
<i>Processing...</i>

13:53.240 --> 13:54.400
<i>Processing...</i>

13:55.400 --> 13:56.640
<i>Earthling.</i>

13:57.200 --> 13:58.440
Jolly good!

13:58.960 --> 14:00.080
Wait!

14:00.160 --> 14:01.400
<i>Selected.</i>

14:04.560 --> 14:08.770
The earthling has ten days to prove
he can use absolute power for good

14:08.840 --> 14:11.000
rather than for evil.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.280
God.

14:30.880 --> 14:31.960
Fuck you!

14:43.080 --> 14:47.320
All they want me to do is help them
sneer at people who write wonderful books.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.720
Well, my producer just wants me
to dig up dirt on Amenhotep III.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.200
I keep telling them he had a kind nature

14:54.280 --> 14:55.400
and lovely hands.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.480
I would have loved to spend
an evening with Amenhotep III.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.000
Yeah, except he's been dead
4,000 years, Rosie,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.720
and he'd spend all day long
talking about embalming.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.840
Well, find me a good one
that's still breathing.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.840
Tell me about it.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.360
What about Grant?

15:11.440 --> 15:14.880
Oh, well, Colonel Grant
turned out to have issues.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.770
- Issues?
- Yeah, like being clinically insane.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.610
Shame.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.170
Maybe that's overstating it.

15:21.240 --> 15:25.290
Uh, just obsessive, possessive
and pathologically jealous.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.200
What about him upstairs?

15:29.080 --> 15:31.280
Oh, he tried to cheer me up
in the supermarket.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.960
Oh, so he's gay?

15:33.040 --> 15:34.200
What?

15:34.880 --> 15:38.160
Well, he's sympathetic,
interested, available.

15:38.720 --> 15:42.610
- That's the way life works.
- No, he's not gay.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.160
He's... very likeable.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.000
Mr Clarke.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.200
Hi.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.120
This is the twelfth time
you've been late this month, Mr Clarke.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.640
Yeah, I got knocked off my bike.

16:19.720 --> 16:24.200
Yesterday you had food poisoning.
Friday you thought it was Saturday.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.240
Monday you forgot to put
your clock forward.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.360
Oh, everybody does that.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.490
Week last Wednesday it seems you had
an appointment with the Dalai Lama.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.130
Yeah, I showed you the picture.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.680
That had Michael Jackson in it as well.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.800
Well, he's a great man.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.010
Great enough to appear in photographs
when he's dead.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.320
You, Mr Clarke, are totally irresponsible,

16:47.440 --> 16:50.410
you are idle and you are feckless.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.000
Feckless?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.560
Yes, you are without feck.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.440
If I could replace you, I would.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.359
Yeah, well, so would I.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.359
I just don't have anybody
to replace me with.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.520
You a big skier?

17:32.960 --> 17:34.160
Well, I've had my moments.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.360
Hello, gorgeous.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.080
How about cocktails for two this evening?
Go halves?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.320
Drop dead, Ray.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.400
All right. Think about
it and get back to me.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.560
Knob.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.640
- Neil?
- Yeah.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.800
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

17:54.880 --> 17:59.200
Hello, Neil, love.
Tinned mouse or fricassee of war victim?

17:59.280 --> 18:01.720
I will have the roast headmaster,
please, Mrs B.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.130
You are a one.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.640
- There you go.
- Thank you.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.480
Uh, I'll have the casserole, please, Mrs B.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.920
You'll enjoy that, Mr Ray.
As long as you don't eat it.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.690
No, I mean, if you could
make anything you want happen,

18:25.760 --> 18:27.200
what would it be?

18:27.280 --> 18:30.250
I would make Dennis regurgitate
my notes from chapter three.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.800
If you could make
something impossible happen.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.690
Intact.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
What if you could make someone
worship the ground you walked on?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.960
What, even if she thought
you were a little shit?

18:50.040 --> 18:51.120
Come on, Ray.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.600
That would be taking an unfair advantage
of an innocent girl.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.360
OK, but suppose
there was one thing you could do

18:57.440 --> 18:59.160
that would change your life for the better?

18:59.520 --> 19:01.960
Oh, that's easy.
I would make alien spaceships destroy 10C.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.720
That sounded like it was in the school.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.720
Out of the way! Out of the way!

19:15.840 --> 19:17.360
Stand back, stand back.
Stand back, stand back.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.640
Now, just stay calm.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.170
Oh, my God!

19:29.400 --> 19:30.600
Who was that?

19:30.720 --> 19:35.760
It was the Salubrious Gat
of Galaxy G946 WOT.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.850
Gat, what do you think you're doing?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.440
<i>Just practising, Sharon.</i>

19:41.840 --> 19:46.200
We haven't done the judicial review yet.
We may not want to destroy this species.

19:46.680 --> 19:47.880
<i>Who are you kidding?</i>

19:47.960 --> 19:53.640
<i>445,349,722 new alien species encountered.</i>

19:54.120 --> 19:55.400
<i>Number granted membership</i>

19:55.480 --> 19:58.290
<i>of the Intergalactic Community
of Superior Beings?</i>

19:58.600 --> 19:59.680
<i>Zero.</i>

20:00.200 --> 20:01.480
We have high standards.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.120
<i>You know you're going to wipe them out.</i>

20:03.320 --> 20:05.160
It all depends on the earthling.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.680
<i>And signs of a recovery
seem as far away as ever.</i>

20:16.480 --> 20:17.970
Hey.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.120
Hello, Dennis.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.840
Oh, Dennis. Couldn't you have waited?

20:24.800 --> 20:27.120
<i>We can now go live
to our reporter Brenda Emmanus</i>

20:27.200 --> 20:28.770
<i>at the scene of the incident.</i>

20:29.080 --> 20:32.050
<i>It was here
at Kinbrook Comprehensive School</i>

20:32.520 --> 20:35.410
<i>that an explosion killed 38 pupils.</i>

20:35.960 --> 20:39.520
<i>A police spokesman said they
could not rule out a terrorist attack</i>

20:39.600 --> 20:41.400
<i>but say there were no
connections with reports</i>

20:41.440 --> 20:44.280
<i>of a UFO sighting in the area.</i>

20:44.360 --> 20:45.800
<i>The head teacher, Mr Robert...</i>

20:50.680 --> 20:52.440
Oh, sure, Dennis,
it was an alien spaceship.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
What are you talking about?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.040
If I could make
an alien spaceship destroy 10C,

20:58.120 --> 21:00.520
then I wouldn't be farting around
with this, would I?

21:00.560 --> 21:01.920
I'd just say,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.650
"Dog mess, clean yourself up."

21:07.200 --> 21:08.610
See?

21:42.320 --> 21:43.480
It's just shock.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.080
It's just post-hallucination shock.
That's all it is.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.840
I mean, it couldn't have been
an alien spaceship, Dennis, could it?

21:54.920 --> 21:58.160
I mean, it just, I mean, it couldn't have.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.640
Oh, my God.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.400
That's my notes.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.080
Ah, damn it!

22:19.480 --> 22:22.160
Whisky, go back in the bottle.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.480
See? You see?
There's nothing. It's nothing.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.960
There was nothing. It's nothing.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.530
Whisky, go back in the bottle.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.920
Oh, my God.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.330
I have to wave my hand.

22:54.240 --> 22:58.600
Whisky, exchange yourself
for another bottle, a single malt.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.840
Hey, come back!

23:24.120 --> 23:25.320
Door, open quick.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.410
Not that quick.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.450
I didn't mean go back to the shop
to get exchanged!

23:38.520 --> 23:39.680
It's closed.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.120
Oh, shit.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.280
- Gotcha!
- Help me, Dennis!

23:53.360 --> 23:54.640
- Priority.
- Help me!

24:06.400 --> 24:09.130
Shh, Dennis, be quiet.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.520
Oh, shit.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.560
All right, laddie. You're nicked.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.520
Me be at home having dinner with Dennis.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.880
Oh, yuck! Chumzy!

24:37.880 --> 24:41.480
You say one word about this, Constable,
you'll be on community relations.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.930
Oh, my God. 10C!

24:58.920 --> 25:01.080
Uh, let everyone who died be alive again.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.120
Oh, God.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.480
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No, I meant
everybody in 10C be alive again!

25:37.320 --> 25:40.320
Obviously. Not everyone who's died ever.
Are you crazy?

25:45.800 --> 25:46.960
Shit. Shit.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.640
And everybody who died in
the bomb blast that is alive again,

25:49.680 --> 25:50.960
be completely uninjured.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.050
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

25:53.320 --> 25:56.560
Uh, OK, me feel better.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.200
Oh, that's better.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.160
Me have a really good idea
about what to do next.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.400
Oh, that's a good idea.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.090
Um, let the explosion never have happened.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.160
No, I mean, if you could make
anything you wanted happen,

26:09.200 --> 26:11.040
what would it be?

26:11.160 --> 26:12.240
I'm sorry, what?

26:12.840 --> 26:14.680
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

26:16.080 --> 26:19.240
That's very weird.
I think I just dreamt that I could.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.360
What?

26:20.520 --> 26:23.330
Do anything. I dreamt that I could just
wave my hand and say such-and-such

26:23.360 --> 26:24.480
and it would happen.

26:24.840 --> 26:25.920
So what did you do?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.840
I made alien spaceships destroy 10C.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.080
Good thinking.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.040
I would make Dorothy Pringle
worship the ground I walked on.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.160
You wouldn't be so cruel.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.960
<i>Hello and welcome to Book News,</i>

26:43.000 --> 26:45.920
<i>the show where you get to know
what books are coming to you</i>

26:46.040 --> 26:47.840
<i>and authors get what's coming to them.</i>

26:49.040 --> 26:51.880
<i>What's the truth under publishers' blurbs?</i>

26:51.920 --> 26:55.890
<i>Why do writers' photographs always
show them looking ten years younger?</i>

26:55.920 --> 26:58.520
<i>You've come to the
right place to find out.</i>

26:58.600 --> 27:01.440
<i>Our first guest tonight
is Mortimer Stanley,</i>

27:01.520 --> 27:05.880
<i>whose latest novel is entitled</i>
What You See With Your Eyes Open.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.200
Mortimer, your last novel
was published nearly ten years ago.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.560
It got what they call "mixed reviews"
and sold fewer than 3,000 copies.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.720
What possessed you to write another one?

27:17.760 --> 27:19.720
Well, my wife was dying.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.640
You were estranged, weren't you?

27:21.720 --> 27:25.770
Well, yes, but on her deathbed,
she urged me to write another book.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.400
Knowing that she would
never have to read it?

27:27.440 --> 27:28.480
Well...

27:29.280 --> 27:32.440
Fenella's complaining that you didn't tell
her about his shoplifting conviction.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.920
Well, he was 14, James.
It's got nothing to do with his book.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.720
Well, neither has the show, Cath.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.080
Listen, what upsets Fenella about you
is your integrity.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.960
But me, I quite like it.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.610
Play your cards right,
you could get your own office

27:48.640 --> 27:50.080
with a bigger desk and a view.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.960
Um...

27:57.680 --> 27:59.600
Sorry. Excuse me one second.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.720
Mind you, you've gotta
play your cards right.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.210
What the hell are you doing here?

28:05.280 --> 28:07.600
- Don't I get a kiss?
- Please go away.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.330
That wouldn't be fair to you, Cath.

28:09.440 --> 28:13.160
This is a wonderful opportunity
for you to get to know the real me.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.850
Well... I'm calling security.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.440
No, not just the charming,
high-flying military strategist.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.440
Hello, security?

28:19.520 --> 28:21.360
Not the inventor of extreme
rendition, either.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.480
Yes, I've got an intruder in room 405.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.490
Or the mastermind behind
warrantless domestic surveillance.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.440
Just a humble officer who adores you.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.640
OK, Grant, I appreciate that you like me...

28:36.800 --> 28:40.880
Like? Like? What do you think,
I'm one of these cardboard cut-outs?

28:41.120 --> 28:45.200
Like? No. No, no, no. Adulate. Worship.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.840
OK, well, I don't adulate or worship you.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.730
I don't even really like you.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.720
So that's why I'm asking you
to just go away and leave me alone.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.360
- So there's some hope?
- No, no, no. There's no hope.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.650
Cath, I came all the way to England
to see you.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.520
Doesn't that show you
how much I care about you?

29:03.640 --> 29:07.160
No, it shows me that you're obsessed.
Obsession's not a quality that I admire.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.480
Really?

29:09.240 --> 29:11.320
I think the lady wants you to go, Colonel.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.200
You work for the BBC, don't you?

29:17.000 --> 29:18.200
I do.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.240
You know who ultimately controls
the British Broadcasting Corporation?

29:27.200 --> 29:29.360
A little guy that used to work
down the hall from me

29:29.400 --> 29:31.400
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.040
And he did it in his spare time.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.770
I'll catch you later, honey.

29:47.040 --> 29:51.360
It was a party. I was doing a documentary.
I was drunk.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.250
Judging me.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.050
Oh, God.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.480
Let 10C become a model class,
kind and considerate.

30:19.560 --> 30:20.800
Oh, and eager to learn.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.600
- Good afternoon, 10C.
- Good afternoon, Mr Clarke.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.320
Um, could you all turn to page 73,
please, and read the entire chapter?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.480
- What, the whole chapter?
- Yes.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.960
- Oh, good.
- How exciting!

30:46.080 --> 30:47.840
He's letting us read the whole chapter!

30:48.160 --> 30:50.520
- Great.
- Well, you get on with it, then.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.370
Let the headmaster
be nice to me for a change.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.760
And what you did
with the guitar quite beggars belief.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.450
That is not how <i>Kumbaya</i> goes.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.880
Neil. So good to see you!

31:25.960 --> 31:29.000
I love what you're wearing.
It really does, it's just a great ensemble.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.960
So similar to what you were wearing before.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.160
But your laissez-faire attitude
to work is a great counterpoint

31:34.200 --> 31:35.800
to my by-the-book approach.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.320
Great having you on the staff, Neil.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.320
- Thank you.
- Right.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.400
Yeah!

31:40.800 --> 31:44.000
He must love you an awful lot
to fly across the Atlantic.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.320
No, he just can't bear losing anything.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.850
As far as Grant's concerned,
I'm just a piece of lost property

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
he wants to retrieve
and put back on his mantelpiece.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.320
He was really scary. Crazy.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.160
I had a boyfriend like that once.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.960
The sort who wouldn't
take no for an answer.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.520
Did you? What happened?

32:02.600 --> 32:04.170
I married him.

32:05.360 --> 32:09.000
Mr Eriksson, you know the romance
languages, French, Italian...

32:09.080 --> 32:10.840
Yes, Miss Pringle, I teach them.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.960
Well, I was wondering
how they got their name?

32:13.080 --> 32:16.520
- It's to do with Rome, ancient Rome.
- It's from the Latin.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.850
So it's just a coincidence
that they sound so romantic?

32:20.920 --> 32:23.570
Actually, I'm thinking
of switching to economics.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.250
Oh.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.040
He is...

32:32.200 --> 32:34.280
Let Miss Pringle worship Ray.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.800
Ray.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.080
I can do abso-fucking-lutely anything.

33:06.760 --> 33:07.960
Yeah.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.080
Me be President of the United States.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.440
Hmm.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.080
That's funny.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.000
Me be President of the United States.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.600
- Thank God we found you, sir.
- Sorry?

33:24.680 --> 33:26.200
We've been looking for you everywhere.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.440
Oh, my God!

33:27.480 --> 33:29.640
Help! Help! Guns! They're shooting!

33:30.640 --> 33:32.840
Move, move, move! Move!

33:37.800 --> 33:40.400
I am sorry about that, Mr President.

33:40.440 --> 33:44.600
Now, here are the briefing papers
for Syria, the deficit,

33:44.640 --> 33:47.530
Israel and the Middle East,
China, global warming,

33:47.640 --> 33:50.840
unemployment and the
Arctic Wildlife Reserve.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.280
They're shooting!

33:53.360 --> 33:55.800
Me be my old self at home!

34:02.480 --> 34:05.880
I can do anything.

34:07.720 --> 34:10.960
OK, but what do I really want?

34:17.480 --> 34:19.280
Give me a really big dick.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.960
Ouch!

34:21.679 --> 34:23.800
Ouch, not that big, obviously!

34:24.320 --> 34:26.400
Just... Dick, return to the old size.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.170
Oh!

34:32.360 --> 34:37.360
OK, um... Let me have a penis
that women find exciting.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.239
Yeah, it's good, yeah.
Can I have it in white?

34:43.360 --> 34:44.719
Right, OK, um...

34:45.920 --> 34:47.679
Let me have a really great body.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.360
Wow.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.199
No.

34:53.679 --> 34:56.719
Um, no, look, no, look,
give me the body of a great man.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.200
What the fuck? Not Albert Einstein.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.360
Let me have the great body of a man.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.200
Me be able to see
Catherine from downstairs, now.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.480
Shit.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.560
Let me not be able to see her.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.800
No, I don't mean me go blind.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.760
Let me be able to see
but floor be as it was.

35:45.320 --> 35:49.000
Uh, Catherine from downstairs,
forget what just happened.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.650
Move out of the way.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.600
Thank you. Quiet, please. Quietly.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.520
- Um. Ray?
- Hmm?

36:14.920 --> 36:18.920
You know earlier on we were talking
about being able to do anything?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.960
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, well, um...

36:21.800 --> 36:27.330
This is going to sound kind of stupid
but suddenly I can.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.330
- Can what?
- Do anything.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.640
Just make things happen.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.360
Things that shouldn't happen,
I just wave my hand and they do.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.160
You feeling OK?

36:39.120 --> 36:40.840
Yeah, um, just look.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.120
You, tell us who you were.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.560
You'll never believe this
but I was a conjuror!

36:50.120 --> 36:52.480
I went by the name of The Great Alfredo.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.280
Real name was Reg Hoskins.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.560
I did variety, clubs,
private parties, the lot.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.520
What is this?
3D projection or something, right?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.960
Course, it's all gone now.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.360
- I blame the wogs.
- Hey!

37:05.640 --> 37:07.480
All that black minstrel stuff.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.200
Once they started allowing that...

37:09.320 --> 37:10.560
That's not me, that's what I'm saying.
It's...

37:10.640 --> 37:13.480
Jews took over the business.
It was never the same again.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.160
Just go and jump out the window.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.520
Right-o. Watch this.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.200
What...

37:31.680 --> 37:34.250
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.240
I could swear it was the skeleton talking.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.890
- Yeah, it was.
- OK.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.560
Let me see you do another one.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.520
Well, what? I can't think of anything.

37:43.680 --> 37:47.520
Oh, come on.
You know, how about some flowers?

37:48.520 --> 37:50.360
Bunch of flowers in my hand.

37:50.440 --> 37:54.080
It's pathetic.
How about room be covered in flowers?

37:55.680 --> 37:56.880
Come on, Ray.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.200
Ray. Think of something more imaginative.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.640
Bloody hell, Palmer.
Did you just throw this out the window?

38:05.960 --> 38:08.320
Neil. Did you throw this out the window?

38:08.360 --> 38:09.640
That's very funny.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.240
What are you doing here?
Go on, get on home. I'll cover for you.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.640
Oh, my God.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.080
This is the best sandwich I've ever tasted.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.880
Told you.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.440
You know what? We could own a racehorse.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.720
Ray, we could own
every racehorse in the world.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.920
No shit.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.530
- We win every time?
- They're all ours.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.880
Let's forget about the horses.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.920
We could have anything, Neil.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.570
Wealth, fame. Women.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.890
We could make any woman
fall in love with us.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.520
Neil, any woman we want.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.840
Goodnight, Catherine.
See you later.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.120
Jump in, babe.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.600
Kerb crawling is illegal
in this country, Grant.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.600
That doesn't really apply to people
with my security clearance.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.400
Besides, how else are
you going to get home?

39:13.440 --> 39:14.930
On the Tube. Go away.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.600
The London Underground is worse than
anything we ever did in Guantanamo.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.290
- You don't deserve that.
- No, I don't deserve this, either.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.010
- Please, leave me alone.
- OK, OK, I get it.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.640
But you gotta let me down gently, huh?

39:26.160 --> 39:27.320
What does that mean?

39:28.640 --> 39:30.040
Well, there's somebody else, right?

39:30.440 --> 39:32.440
No, Grant, that's not what this is about.

39:32.680 --> 39:33.720
It's...

39:34.840 --> 39:36.330
You and I are not compatible.

39:38.200 --> 39:41.120
So, we could grab some
coffee, sit and talk.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.000
What would that even achieve?
There's nothing to talk about.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.200
Except for the luxury
apartment I rented for us.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.880
It's got a view of St Paul's Cathedral.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.810
Oh, my God. Go home, Grant.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.320
- Here's the key.
- I don't want it.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.160
And when I get you up there,

39:57.240 --> 40:00.160
you're going to think you died
and went to heaven.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.280
- Fuck Grant.
- Oh, yeah, fuck Grant.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.690
Fuck Grant.

40:45.320 --> 40:49.000
Fuck James Cleverill.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.560
Fuck all TV producers.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.920
Especially ones that say
you can sleep with them.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.960
But if I play my cards right.

41:11.040 --> 41:14.240
Why do I always end up
with the control freaks?

41:14.400 --> 41:15.840
- Or gays.
- Yeah.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.600
- Who?
- Him upstairs.

41:19.360 --> 41:20.850
Oh, honey, he's not gay.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.360
He's attractive. He's kind.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.440
Well, then, fuck him.

41:26.720 --> 41:29.560
- No, he's nice.
- No, I don't mean fuck him.

41:30.760 --> 41:33.240
I mean fuck him.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.280
- You mean fuck him?
- Yeah.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.920
- What, right now?
- No, not now.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.560
You've got to let me do your make-up first.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.690
<i>Malfunction.
Galactic power failure.</i>

41:53.440 --> 41:56.090
Bother, we'll have to suspend the test.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.440
- What?
- This is on the blink, Sharon.

41:58.760 --> 42:02.280
The earthling won't have galactic power
until I get it working again.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.680
Botheration!

42:04.040 --> 42:07.680
I thought our galactic powers
meant we could do anything?

42:13.120 --> 42:15.770
Catherine from downstairs,
be madly in love with me.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.200
That was quick.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.560
- Um, you're not gay, are you?
- No, no.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.480
- Let's go to bed.
- OK.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.850
Oh, shit!

42:46.920 --> 42:48.330
Ow, my leg!

42:53.080 --> 42:54.320
Got it.

42:54.960 --> 42:58.560
<i>Galactic power
now returning to earthling.</i>

43:30.680 --> 43:33.410
Weather, be like it is in Los Angeles.

43:35.720 --> 43:38.760
I didn't mean be like it is in Los Angeles
right this moment.

43:38.880 --> 43:41.480
It's the middle of the night,
for crying out loud.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.880
Weather, be like it usually is

43:43.920 --> 43:46.200
in Los Angeles during the day.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.360
So pedantic.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.200
All right.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.440
Clothes, get dressed on me.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.760
And smarten yourselves up.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.640
Better.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.440
Miss Pringle, this really...

44:34.600 --> 44:35.840
has to stop.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.360
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, Lord.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.920
Yeah.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.280
Ah. OK.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.040
That was a very interesting... Ow! Ow!

44:53.120 --> 44:54.770
Could you just stop that, please?

44:54.960 --> 44:58.280
You, stop tapping.
Let's just have a break, shall we? Just...

44:59.320 --> 45:01.360
Right, what's next?

45:02.200 --> 45:03.440
Ooh.

45:03.480 --> 45:06.050
This one's in German. Wow.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.480
Let me be able to understand German.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.200
What are you talking about, Dennis?

45:17.280 --> 45:20.120
Look, just shut up, OK? I can handle this.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.240
She's not going to ask me to marry her.

45:23.320 --> 45:26.720
Or have my children, OK?

45:26.800 --> 45:29.840
Dennis, what are you talking about?

45:33.240 --> 45:35.160
That's a good idea, actually.
What are you talking about?

45:35.400 --> 45:36.560
Dennis, be able to talk.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.920
Biscuits.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.920
- What?
- Biscuits.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.520
Maybe if I make her fall in love with me
like a little bit, you know,

45:44.640 --> 45:46.050
so she doesn't want to marry me

45:46.160 --> 45:47.400
- but she would have sex on a regular...
- Biscuits.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.490
- For crying out loud, they're in the cupboard.
- What are?

45:50.880 --> 45:53.690
Biscuits. Red biscuits, black biscuits.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.760
- Nothing else matters.
- Is that all you think about?

45:55.840 --> 45:57.600
Yes, yes! Biscuits.

45:59.680 --> 46:03.280
All right, Dennis,
become a rational, thinking creature.

46:03.840 --> 46:06.840
Look, I just can't concentrate on anything
until I've had one of those biscuits.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.960
I know it's crazy but that's how it is.
I guess I'm kind of hooked on them.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.840
So please give me just one biscuit,

46:11.880 --> 46:14.530
then I'll be able to think
about something else.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.360
That makes sense.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.840
Oh, oh, oh! He's getting the biscuits!
He's getting them! This is it!

46:18.920 --> 46:19.960
Yeah!

46:22.360 --> 46:24.200
He's got them.

46:24.280 --> 46:27.560
He's got them. He's going to throw one.
Get ready, get ready. Here it comes.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.760
Ah! Mmm. Mmm.

46:31.600 --> 46:36.080
God, it must be terrible being a dog.
I never realised you had so many cravings.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.720
- It's no worse than you and that bitch.
- What bitch?

46:38.760 --> 46:40.920
The bitch you were shagging last night.

46:41.040 --> 46:45.320
Oh, my God. She's not a bitch, OK?
She's a lovely human female.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.560
And we weren't just shagging.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.240
Right. Come to think of it, I wouldn't
mind shagging your leg right now.

46:49.280 --> 46:51.480
A little leg dance, huh?
Just above the sock.

46:51.560 --> 46:53.280
- Ah...
- How about it? Come on, Daddy.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.240
I thought I turned you into
a rational, thinking creature.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.800
Rational, thinking creatures
still have desires.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.920
Oh, well,
we can soon deal with that.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.240
No!

47:02.480 --> 47:05.640
- No, no, don't take my desires away from me.
- Why not?

47:05.720 --> 47:09.160
They're what makes my life worth living.
Biscuits, shagging.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.560
I don't think I like your conversation.

47:11.680 --> 47:14.490
But I worship you, master.
I love you so much.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.170
- I can't bear displeasing you.
- I... I know.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.810
- My whole world collapses...
- I know. Yes. I love you.

47:17.920 --> 47:18.920
When you're cross with me.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.160
Look, maybe it was better
when you didn't talk.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.480
Oh, no, don't take away my power of speech
now that I can think rationally.

47:23.600 --> 47:24.960
That would be so cruel.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.800
- I heard the bell. Somebody at the door.
- OK, no...

47:27.920 --> 47:29.760
- The bell! Hey! The bell!
- No, no. Dennis. Dennis, good dog.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.920
- Hello, the bell!
- Dennis... Dennis.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.080
- Hey, hey, somebody.
- Just... Just quiet.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.360
There it goes again.
Hey, hey, somebody at the door.

47:34.440 --> 47:36.160
Oh, no, have I done something wrong again?

47:36.280 --> 47:38.240
No, just... Just be quiet.
Do you understand me?

47:39.400 --> 47:42.160
Yes. Yes, anything to stop you
being angry with me.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.810
The bell! There it goes again!

47:43.960 --> 47:45.080
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

47:45.120 --> 47:47.240
Dennis, listen. Just listen,
listen, listen, listen.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.160
Be quiet. That is an order.

47:49.280 --> 47:51.440
Right. Quiet.

47:51.480 --> 47:54.290
I like obeying orders,
especially your orders.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.160
Good. Well, then, shut the fuck up.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.760
Right, right. Shut the fuck up.
Yeah, right.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.280
Good boy.

48:08.960 --> 48:14.800
Oh, God, I made her do it.
I made her do it... I... OK.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.120
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:18.160 --> 48:21.000
- Can I come in?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.

48:23.360 --> 48:27.120
- So, look, um, about last night...
- Yes.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.440
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no. No, no.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.440
OK. Um, I just... I don't want you to think

48:31.480 --> 48:34.800
that I, um, do that sort
of thing all the time

48:34.840 --> 48:37.410
because... Because I don't.

48:37.480 --> 48:40.320
- Um... I was slightly drunk.
- Yeah, well, I mean, naturally.

48:40.400 --> 48:42.320
Otherwise we probably wouldn't have
done the thing with the...

48:42.360 --> 48:44.010
- No, no, no, that's not what I mean.
- Beard trimmer.

48:44.040 --> 48:48.040
I mean, I like you. I, um, I've
always really enjoyed talking to you.

48:48.160 --> 48:51.560
I just... I probably wouldn't have jumped
on you like that if I hadn't...

48:52.480 --> 48:56.040
- Been pissed as a newt?
- Well, sort of.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.960
Yeah, OK. Well, then, let's just forget it.
It never... It never happened.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.800
No, no, no, that's not
what I'm saying, Neil.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.520
Oh, well, um, what did you want, then?

49:04.200 --> 49:05.690
Shag her, Neil!

49:06.040 --> 49:07.640
That's Dennis.

49:09.320 --> 49:12.210
- Dennis?
- Yeah. He is a plumber.

49:12.240 --> 49:15.050
Um, I'm having a few problems
with my waterworks. My water pipes.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.360
Shag her, Neil!

49:17.840 --> 49:20.680
I'd better get him the shagger.
It's a special wrench that plumbers use.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.370
I thought I told you to shut up.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, sorry.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.370
You're supposed to be
a rational, thinking creature.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.280
Sorry, sorry. Can't help myself. Sorry.
Oh, dear. I wanna shag your leg.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.440
Shh. It's not a great time,
to be honest.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.050
Maybe later, if you behave.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.200
Oh...

49:37.240 --> 49:41.680
Oh... Couldn't... Couldn't find the shagger,
so he just went with the old decoupler.

49:41.720 --> 49:43.370
I love you, Neil!

49:43.400 --> 49:45.520
Shut up, Dennis!

49:45.840 --> 49:48.040
It's odd, isn't it,
shouting at the plumber like that?

49:48.080 --> 49:51.520
But, uh, the fact is he's my brother.
The plumber is my brother.

49:51.560 --> 49:53.960
Say you love me, Neil.

49:54.080 --> 49:55.240
And we're very close.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.400
- God, Rosie was right.
- Rosie?

49:57.520 --> 49:59.960
Please can I shag your leg?

50:00.440 --> 50:03.200
Jesus, Neil, how could you?
The next morning!

50:03.440 --> 50:04.720
What? I...

50:04.880 --> 50:08.440
- Why do I always end up with creeps?
- I'm not a creep!

50:08.480 --> 50:11.480
There was a cat, Neil!
Neil! Hey, you, cat!

50:11.600 --> 50:14.410
Stay out of my garden, go on!
Neil, it's a ginger tom!

50:16.080 --> 50:18.280
Dennis, be a dumb animal again
for five minutes.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.400
So she thinks I'm gay.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.880
I mean, so what, you know?

50:25.920 --> 50:29.120
I mean, it means that she won't want to
marry me or have my kids.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.280
Bingo. Problem solved.

50:33.120 --> 50:34.640
Thank you, Dennis.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.120
Catherine!

50:45.840 --> 50:47.600
Catherine!

50:49.960 --> 50:52.160
Um, me be on the bus.

50:54.920 --> 50:57.920
Ah! I don't mean on the bus.
I mean in the bus.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.640
Not in the engine.
In the passenger accommodation!

51:05.760 --> 51:07.330
Ow!

51:10.480 --> 51:11.640
Hey!

51:12.600 --> 51:13.640
Catherine!

51:23.800 --> 51:25.480
Catherine!

51:25.840 --> 51:27.330
Catherine!

51:27.720 --> 51:28.840
Whoa.

51:28.880 --> 51:30.960
- Ray.
- You've gotta stop Miss Pringle.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.730
She's... She's set up shrines
all over the school.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.170
There's even a website.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.810
Look, you wanted her to worship you, OK?

51:36.840 --> 51:38.840
- Not like this.
- Ray, I don't have time for this.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.840
Wait, wait, wait.
You haven't lost the powers, have you?

51:40.960 --> 51:43.200
- No, I haven't lost the powers. Ray.
- You have. You've lost the...

51:43.320 --> 51:44.360
- I haven't lost the powers.
- Do the thing.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.890
Ray, become a duck.

51:48.880 --> 51:53.920
Ray. Ray, stop it. Ray, stop it.
Ray, stop it. Ray, become a sausage.

51:54.400 --> 51:58.200
- I haven't lost the powers, Ray, OK? This is...
- Where is he, Neil?

51:58.680 --> 52:01.040
Oh. That's his car.

52:01.360 --> 52:04.840
Oh. Behold the car of Ray!

52:08.360 --> 52:11.170
- Catherine, can we talk?
- No.

52:11.200 --> 52:12.610
But I love you.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.520
You also love Dennis, apparently.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.920
- Did you take that off there?
- Uh, no, this is mine.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.400
- Yours?
- Yeah.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.170
Look, you've got it all wrong about Dennis.

52:20.240 --> 52:23.880
I've nothing whatsoever against Dennis.
You love him, he loves you.

52:23.960 --> 52:26.120
I'm happy for both of you.
Just don't bring me into it.

52:26.240 --> 52:28.400
Yeah, no, but there's something I need
to tell you about Dennis.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.520
You are going to have to pay for that
now that you've touched it.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.160
- It's mine!
- No, it isn't.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.680
Look, I heard what you
said to each other, Neil.

52:33.720 --> 52:36.000
Yeah, look. There's something crucial
about Dennis you don't know.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.080
- Hey!
- He's not a man.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.360
I don't want to hear this, Neil.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.890
I know, but I'm just saying,
he's not a man.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.760
Ow! Ah! Hell's tits!

52:41.880 --> 52:43.240
- You pervert!
- Ow!

52:43.320 --> 52:44.800
You come in here and steal our stuff?

52:44.840 --> 52:45.880
I told you, that's not your sausage.

52:45.920 --> 52:48.160
- It is my sausage. Give it back.
- Get off. Be careful, be careful.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.760
- Just let go!
- Oh, God!

52:49.840 --> 52:52.410
- Give me 80p.
- Fine.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.040
- I'll just get your change.
- No, it's... Never mind. It's...

52:56.080 --> 52:57.410
Well, no, cos it's Â£4.20.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.440
- Keep it.
- It's too much for a tip.

52:59.560 --> 53:02.450
- Have it your way.
- I should think so, too. Jesus.

53:04.600 --> 53:07.280
Feck. Sausage, become Ray.

53:07.920 --> 53:12.400
Jesus, Neil. Have you any idea
how vulnerable a sausage feels?

53:12.680 --> 53:13.880
There he is!

53:15.440 --> 53:16.930
I'm off!

53:17.360 --> 53:19.760
- Leave me alone, you nutters!
- Ray! Ray!

53:19.920 --> 53:22.400
Here you go. You must have been hungry.

53:25.440 --> 53:28.800
It's clear he has no idea of doing
any good whatsoever.

53:29.040 --> 53:32.960
Why can't we just get on
with the destruction?

53:33.040 --> 53:35.120
Because there are rules, Maureen.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.040
We must follow galactic procedure.

53:37.120 --> 53:41.800
Rules didn't stop you from eating
the inhabitants of G4378, Janet!

53:41.920 --> 53:44.440
They were delicious.
Very crunchy, as I recall...

53:49.920 --> 53:51.640
- Surprise, surprise!
- Oh, my God!

53:51.760 --> 53:53.800
- No!
- Wait. Wait, wait. Catherine!

53:55.400 --> 53:56.400
You're crazy, do you know that?

53:56.600 --> 53:59.080
Crazy in love, darlin'.

53:59.240 --> 54:01.120
Get out of my flat, Grant.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.650
Well, I can't because
you've locked the door now, babe.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.600
Well, then, get out the way you got in.

54:04.640 --> 54:07.840
Oh, honey, come on, now. That ain't nice!

54:07.960 --> 54:11.160
Just get out, Grant.
I never want to see you again!

54:11.280 --> 54:12.960
Get out of my life!

54:13.000 --> 54:14.650
Get out!

54:15.120 --> 54:17.240
Come on, now, open the door.

54:17.320 --> 54:20.000
Sorry. Sorry about the noise.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.360
At least it wasn't barking.

54:22.440 --> 54:24.320
Feck off. Not you.

54:24.360 --> 54:25.880
- Walk out the front door, OK?
- Honey!

54:25.960 --> 54:27.880
Then sneak in the back.
Make your way up to my place. No moves.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.440
- No, no, no funny business.
- Come on. Let the love shine through.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.850
You can just stay out of his way

54:31.920 --> 54:33.840
- and I will make you dinner.
- Love me!

54:34.480 --> 54:36.200
- I hate doors!
- All right.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.810
But invite Dennis.
We'll behave like grown-ups.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.520
- Catherine?
- OK.

54:39.640 --> 54:41.440
- Catherine, come back.
- I'm leaving!

54:41.480 --> 54:45.640
OK. I'm coming!
Hold on. Wait for me, now.

54:48.280 --> 54:49.850
She's coming to dinner!

54:49.880 --> 54:52.280
<i>This episode looks at doggy fantasies.</i>

54:52.360 --> 54:54.720
Whoa. Hey! It was just about to start.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.880
She's coming to dinner.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.320
- Who?
- Catherine.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.040
Oh, the bitch.

55:01.160 --> 55:04.880
Don't call her that, all right?
I don't want you chipping in, either, OK?

55:05.000 --> 55:06.840
Just pretend to be a dumb animal again.

55:07.240 --> 55:08.570
Me? A dumb animal?

55:08.720 --> 55:10.640
Yeah, well, you know how to pretend,
don't you?

55:10.800 --> 55:12.210
It's just... It's called acting.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.240
Oh, you mean like when I'm having
my tummy tickled?

55:14.640 --> 55:17.720
- You love having your tummy tickled.
- No, I don't.

55:18.520 --> 55:21.090
- What?
- It's a sham, Neil. All dogs do it.

55:21.640 --> 55:25.040
- Why?
- Why do humans like tickling dogs' tummies?

55:25.240 --> 55:27.000
Because they love
having their tummies tickled.

55:27.080 --> 55:31.360
Uh-uh. Dogs pretend to like it because
they know human beings like doing it.

55:32.240 --> 55:37.080
Well, just pretend to be
a perfectly ordinary dog, OK?

55:37.240 --> 55:39.560
Can't I join in the
conversation just a little bit?

55:39.600 --> 55:42.920
- No.
- That is so cruel.

55:44.600 --> 55:48.280
Somebody at the door! Hey! Hey! It's the bell!
It's the bell! It's the bell! It's the bell!

55:48.360 --> 55:50.760
- I know it's the bell, Dennis.
- Right. No, no, sorry.

55:50.880 --> 55:54.400
Just one more peep out of you, OK,
and the flea collar is going back on again.

55:55.080 --> 55:58.050
Right, right, right.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.360
Bark.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.600
Woof.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.450
Do it properly.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.960
Yeah, good. OK, thank you.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.520
Got it.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.120
- Hi.
- Has he gone?

56:11.200 --> 56:12.560
No, I don't think so.

56:13.040 --> 56:14.880
- Ooh!
- Dennis, down.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.280
You named him after the plumber,
then, did you?

56:18.360 --> 56:19.770
Uh...

56:21.240 --> 56:24.240
Ah. Do you want your tummy tickled?

56:24.800 --> 56:27.240
Why do dogs like that so much?

56:28.560 --> 56:30.050
I don't know.

56:34.880 --> 56:37.640
So the producer promises to take me
out of the general office

56:37.720 --> 56:40.160
and give me a big desk with a view,
but he won't.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.640
He's just trying to get me into bed.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.840
What did you want to tell me?

56:48.560 --> 56:50.320
Uh, just try this first.

57:02.520 --> 57:03.600
Mmm.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.520
Oh, that's incredible.

57:09.800 --> 57:13.280
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

57:16.000 --> 57:21.160
Mmm. I had no idea you were
such a fantastic cook.

57:21.200 --> 57:24.840
I've... I've... It's unlike anything
I've ever tasted. What is it?

57:25.560 --> 57:29.360
I just said, "Let the soup be the most
amazing thing Catherine has ever tasted",

57:29.480 --> 57:31.360
"unlike anything she's tasted before."

57:31.400 --> 57:34.840
- And it is.
- Really?

57:34.880 --> 57:41.840
Really. I can make things happen. Anything.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.000
That's what I was trying to tell you
this morning, you know?

57:45.040 --> 57:47.320
I wasn't talking to a live-in
homosexual plumber.

57:47.400 --> 57:49.050
I was talking to Dennis.

57:49.880 --> 57:51.840
- The dog?
- Dennis the dog.

57:52.720 --> 57:57.400
- Who answered you back?
- Yeah, because I made him talk.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.560
- Oh.
- With my powers.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.600
Special powers?

58:05.880 --> 58:08.360
I mean, what, you... You want
a bigger desk? You got it.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.240
You want a great view? You got it.

58:11.240 --> 58:15.920
Um... Neil, how long have you had
these special powers?

58:16.560 --> 58:18.360
Well, they came upon me very suddenly.

58:18.440 --> 58:21.760
- Very suddenly?
- Yeah, I was knocked off my bike.

58:22.400 --> 58:23.760
Just ask me to do something, anything.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.080
- Just, you know...
- Listen, Neil, it's... It's OK.

58:27.800 --> 58:29.210
You can get help with this.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.770
Son of a bitch!

58:30.960 --> 58:32.120
Oh!

58:32.400 --> 58:33.810
Shit, Grant!

58:33.920 --> 58:35.080
I'm out of here!

58:35.240 --> 58:37.600
- There's nobody else, huh?
- Who is this guy?

58:37.640 --> 58:39.920
She didn't tell you? I'm her fiancÃ©.

58:39.960 --> 58:41.640
- You're not my fiancÃ©, Grant.
- Oh, yeah?

58:41.760 --> 58:44.080
And you weren't just making out
with this apology of a man?

58:44.120 --> 58:45.400
Stop this.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.400
You know how long you'd last
on a battlefield, soldier?

58:47.440 --> 58:48.600
I'm sorry, Neil.

58:48.640 --> 58:50.720
- That long.
- I'm warning you.

58:51.120 --> 58:53.600
- You're warning me?
- Yeah, I'm warning you.

58:53.640 --> 58:55.240
Who is this guy?

58:55.320 --> 58:57.240
- Why don't you suck on this, asshole?
- Grant!

58:57.560 --> 59:00.450
All I have to do is go like this and...
And say what?

59:00.480 --> 59:03.800
- Where did you find this fruitcake?
- Put that away, Grant.

59:03.920 --> 59:06.080
Uh, what can I say? Grant, become a fairy?

59:06.160 --> 59:08.640
- It's Grant, not...
- Grant.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.720
- Stop it.
- And you're the goddamn fairy.

59:10.880 --> 59:12.760
How about Grant go back
to where you came from?

59:12.800 --> 59:15.200
- It's Grant.
- How about kiss my arse, Grant?

59:15.320 --> 59:16.970
Neil, don't. He's crazy.

59:17.040 --> 59:20.640
How about you say, "Please, Grant,
don't put a bullet through my brain?"

59:20.720 --> 59:24.610
- Grant, stop it!
- I prefer, "Let all bullets bounce off me."

59:24.800 --> 59:28.440
- Go on, shoot me.
- Oh, my God. You're both crazy.

59:28.480 --> 59:30.560
- He doesn't dare.
- Neil, please, please.

59:30.640 --> 59:33.240
Go on, pull the trigger.
What's the matter, "Grant"?

59:33.320 --> 59:34.650
- Shut up.
- Go on, shoot me.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.280
- Neil, he will.
- No, he won't.

59:36.320 --> 59:39.290
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't. Grant, drop the gun.

59:39.320 --> 59:41.320
You little shit!

59:43.160 --> 59:44.960
You're idiots, both of you.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.080
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

59:46.160 --> 59:47.160
"I wouldn't do
this if I were you."

59:47.280 --> 59:48.400
God, I hate the English.

59:53.520 --> 59:56.000
Let Grant's arm break if
he tries to throttle me.

59:56.120 --> 59:57.770
Shut up. It's Grant!

59:57.840 --> 59:59.680
Oh!

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.600
Help! Help! Help!

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.840
Who the heck was that?

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.000
Uh, that's Dennis.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.200
Ow.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.680
It's just a dog! English dick.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.120
- Ow! Ow... Shit! Shit! What happened?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.720
- Do you want me to make it better?
- It hurts.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.480
Grant's arm be better.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.210
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, what is this?

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.000
Grant be stuck on the ceiling.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.560
Oh, shit!

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.920
Grant be plastered to the wall.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.160
Wait, wait, wait. Let's talk about this.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.520
Grant be buried head
first in the plant pot.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.050
What do you mean, potted plant?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.880
Grant be standing in front of me.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.400
Yeah. You wanna be nice to me, Grant, OK?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.680
Maybe I can help you.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.400
- You?
- I could make your life absolutely hell

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.250
or I could say,
"Grant be holding a million dollars."

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.040
Oh, yeah!

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.680
Or I could say,
"A million dollars, disappear."

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.600
Fuck! Come on!

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.440
I can do anything.
All I have to do is wave my hand.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.680
- You gotta wave your hand?
- That's right.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.920
Isn't he great? I love you.
I love you so much.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.360
- Dennis, keep out of this.
- But you are great, Neil.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.720
- You can do anything.
- Dennis, shut up. I'm not...

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.880
Master! Neil!

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.360
- Hi. Made your mind up yet?
- How about tonight?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.450
Good girl. 8:00, my place.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.960
Yeah. I always pick the wrong guy, anyway.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.440
Oh, and, uh, I got you a new desk.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.560
Hey!

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.130
Well, it's about time. Now, listen up.
When I take that gag out of your mouth,

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.320
you're going to say exactly what's on that
piece of paper, you understand?

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:44.120
The moment you say a word that is not on
that piece of paper, I kill the dog.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.680
Don't let him shoot me, Neil.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.520
Understand? Nod if you understand.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:57.480
OK. OK. I'm going to take the gag out now.
Remember, one wrong word

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.680
and the dog gets it.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:09.360
OK, read. Item number one, let's go.
Come on.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.120
"Item number one.
All pasty white Englishmen..."

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.040
"Pasty white Englishmen to get big ears
and webbed feet?"

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.040
- Now wave your hand.
- What?

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.720
Wave your hand!

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.640
Oh!

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.680
Yes! Yes! Oh, it's beautiful.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.160
Neil! Neil!

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.570
Neil?

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.880
Neil?

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.080
Oh!

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.440
You don't worship me, do you?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.240
What? Ray. You're Ray.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.770
- I can't find Neil.
- Isn't he here?

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.360
He wasn't at school, either.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.090
Oh, I left him with my crazy,
gun-toting ex-boyfriend.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.360
- Neil's got these powers.
- No, I know, I know.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.520
Oh.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.440
He got Miss Pringle to... To worship me
and now she's turned me into a religion.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.960
- They think I'm immortal.
- So what?

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.720
They want me to prove it
by rising from the dead.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.770
We've got to find Neil.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.610
Wait.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.640
Hey! Hey!

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.640
What are you doing?

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.920
No...

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.120
Got it.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.320
- Where's your car?
- Why?

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.600
I know where they are.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.000
It's just out here. We can... Shit!

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.840
Lord.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.440
Oh, no. Run for it!

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.680
Get him! Lord!

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.800
Yeah!

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.080
This is working beautifully.
OK, keep going. Number three. Let's go.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:27.520
OK. "Three. All British police
to have pink uniforms."

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.600
My personal favourite.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.760
Ray!

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.480
Lord! Come to us!

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.520
Ray! Ray!

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.000
What's this all about?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.040
Oi!

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.880
Take that off!

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.720
There he is!

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:38.560
Oh! Oh... Oh, it's beautiful.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.400
I can't believe it. All right, next one.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.120
Come on, read.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.200
"Let all traffic lights be
permanently set on green."

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.760
Come on. That's just...

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.320
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.560
Huh? Do it, do it.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.930
Wait. Now, listen.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.050
All right.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.440
Grant, are you in there?

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.160
Skip to the end. Hurry up.
Just skip to the end!

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:24.040
Skip to the end. Just...
There. Come on, quick. Read it.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.010
Uh, uh... OK, OK,
"Item 417, Catherine West..."

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.360
- Come on.
- All right.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.000
Let them go, Grant.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.520
Why should I?
Go on, Neil. Read the last item.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.730
"Item 417, Catherine West be madly, deeply
in love with Colonel Grant Kotchev"

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.720
"and leap on him like a tigress
begging for sex."

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.040
- You bastard.
- Now, come on, now.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.450
Wave your hand. Come on.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.640
- Neil, don't!
- Or the dog gets it!

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.000
Don't let him shoot me, Neil.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.440
Come on, wave your goddamn hand!

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.210
But I don't want to love him, Neil.
I don't want to go anywhere near him.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.850
I don't wanna die.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.250
Yeah.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.720
Grant, I love you.
Please, please, let's have sex now.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.160
Oh, yeah.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.400
Dennis, be free.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.080
I'm free! I'm free!

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.279
Please.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.240
Uh, uh,

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:21.600
- Grant become a corgi!
- What?

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.960
Oh, shit.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.240
Do it. Do it, Grant.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:27.000
Do it, do it!

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.890
Me be free.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.160
Yes, yes! Master.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.160
- Yeah.
- You chose to save me rather than that bitch.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.680
Yeah, don't call her that. Catherine be
her normal self and not in love with Grant.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.160
Ugh!

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.760
And all Grant's wishes be cancelled.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.880
- Ray!
- Oh, shit.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.680
Oh, no. Get off me!

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.800
Neil, stop them!

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.399
Lord, show us how to conquer death!

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:58.000
Dorothy Pringle, think about Ray
the way that you used to.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:04.640
- What the hell, Ray?
- It was nothing to do with me.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.399
Get lost, you creep!

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.240
- Thank you.
- Everyone else, forget about Ray.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.490
Thanks, Neil. Thanks a whole bunch.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.330
Ray, could you take me home, please?

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.840
Sure.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.880
I'm... I'm sorry...

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.520
Any thoughts?

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.439
- Pathetic!
- He has no concept of good or evil.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.160
Well, the dogs seem all right.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.960
Yes, yes, the dogs are all right.
It's the people I can't stand.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.360
Oh, hey. Catherine, hi.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.480
Hey, sorry about the other night.
It was... Can I cook you supper?

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.000
- Uh, no, thanks, Neil.
- I'm doing a whole suckling pig.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.040
- No.
- Hey, what's the matter?

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.440
Is it because I made you
throw yourself at Grant?

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:23.760
No. Look, you did what you had to do.
It worked. Forgotten.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.920
Well, what is it, then?

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.760
Do you know what it feels like
to be in someone else's power?

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.370
To have no will of your own?

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.520
Look, I thought that I made you love me.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.440
- What?
- You know, with my powers.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.720
Oh, my God.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.480
Did I really come home early tonight
because I wanted to or did you make me?

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.600
Have I always lived opposite you
or have you somehow rearranged things?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.160
- I'm never going to know.
- Look, I love you.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.320
How could any woman love a man
who could make her do whatever he wants,

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.840
any second, every day, forever?

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.400
Look, I'm sorry, Neil, I could never
love you, not in a million years.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.130
Oh! Catherine...

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.480
Sharon, Sharon, terrible news!

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.560
This is indeed grave news.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.290
It appears that the Salubrious Gat has been

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.960
interfering with our translation devices.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.570
What's he done, Sharon?

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.410
I'm afraid, Janet, that we have been
calling ourselves

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.000
by foolish-sounding earthling names.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.000
Female ones, at that.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:38.810
It seems that Sharon is particularly favoured
among female earthlings from Australia.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.160
The shame of it.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.160
Sharon... I mean,
what should we be calling you?

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.570
Call me the Death-Dealing Darkness-Bringer.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.920
Yes, oh, Death-Dealer.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.760
Great waffles, master.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.770
Who cares about waffles?

01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.560
Catherine hates me. Ray hates me.
Everybody hates me.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.160
I don't hate you and I care about waffles.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.960
I think I like them even more
than biscuits, even red biscuits.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.640
You know what the worse thing is, Dennis?
This is all my fault.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.880
Mmm-hmm?

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.690
You know, I was just thinking about myself,
what I could get.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.920
- Hmm.
- And yet with these powers, you know,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.360
I could have solved every
problem in the world.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.920
- I could have made people happy.
- You couldn't make Catherine happy.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.050
Yeah, because I wanted her to love me.
You know, I was being selfish.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.160
I mean, take world hunger, you know? Uh...

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.880
Let everybody in the world have as much
food as they want.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.880
I mean, take homelessness. Let everybody
in the world have somewhere to live.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.240
No, no, no, live in their dream house.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:46.570
And war, senseless war, over forever.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.920
Let there be no reason for anyone
to make war on anyone any more.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.880
Yay!

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.160
Oh, and reverse global warming.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.410
Has it happened?

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.600
<i>The latest nation to
succumb to the sudden mysterious</i>

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.800
<i>exponential growth in world food
supplies is China,</i>

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.040
<i>where the average weight
is now 300 pounds and rising.</i>

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.520
<i>Well, today a party of picnicking
schoolchildren brought down</i>

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.880
<i>a mile-long section of
the Great Wall of China.</i>

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.400
<i>As homelessness
becomes a thing of the past,</i>

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.240
<i>the last undeveloped area
of the Sahara Desert</i>

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.680
<i>has become a gated community
known as Beau Geste Towers.</i>

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.360
<i>Property developers are now
converging on Antarctica.</i>

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.640
- Well, I mean, at least I got rid of war.
- Whoa, that was a good one.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.800
"Let there be no reason to make war..."

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.680
- "To make war on anyone any more."
- "...on anyone any more."

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.640
How could that go wrong?

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.160
<i>For no reason at all,
New Zealand has declared war on Iceland.</i>

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.480
Oh, wow. Oh, dear.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:47.560
<i>Barbados has declared war on Somalia.
And in a surprise move,</i>

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.520
<i>the tiny island of St Kitts and Nevis has
declared war on the entire rest of the world.</i>

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.120
<i>Our war correspondent says
he is unavailable for comment</i>

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.240
<i>because he's too busy covering all the
other wars which have just broken out</i>

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.680
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.600
<i>A short time ago, scientists were afraid
of constantly rising global temperatures.</i>

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.000
<i>- But none of them have any explanation...</i>
- Oh, my God.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.040
<i>- For this sudden return...</i>
- Global warming.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.680
<i>Not only to the last ice age but to a
snowball Earth of half a billion years ago.</i>

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.600
<i>On the other hand, plans to turn the Antarctic
into the Captain Scott gated community</i>

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.610
<i>- have been put on hold...</i>
- Shit!

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.440
- Shit, shit, shit!
- Oh, it's not so easy trying to do good, is it?

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.560
Yeah, but this is just unfair.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.880
Let everything go back to how it was
before I started trying to make

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.560
everything better for everybody.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.160
<i>Beautiful though
the Earth looks from space,</i>

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.000
<i>we all know how fragile it is, how much
damage human beings have done to it</i>

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.640
<i>and will, it seems, continue to do to it.</i>

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.080
Absolute power doesn't corrupt.
It just drives you bloody mad.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.320
- Tell Catherine I love her.
- Don't do it, master. I love you!

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.680
I've made arrangements for your biscuits.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.760
You'll never have to
worry about them again.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.520
You're the kindest master.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.720
Just shush, OK? I can't concentrate.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.920
- Master, don't you love me?
- I can't stand it, Dennis.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.680
I just... I can't stand the responsibility.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.570
You need to get that into
your stupid dog brain.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.920
Neil!

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.320
I'll save you, master. Here I come!

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.330
Oh, wait a second. I can't swim.
Master, help! Woof!

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.880
Help! Help! Oh, dear. Woof! Woof!

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.890
Oh, there you are. Thank you, master.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.000
Bless you!

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.920
You do love me, master.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.600
Of course I love you, Dennis.
I just don't love myself.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.160
Time's up! Prime the Destruction Generator.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.480
- Hang on.
- What?

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.680
We need to check if he's passed the test.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.920
- Well, he did start all those wars.
- That was good.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.560
- But then he stopped them all.
- But why?

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.930
He said he was trying to make things
better for people.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.720
That's very appalling.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.440
The only good is to destroy.
The only evil is weakness.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.490
Weakness must be annihilated!

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.280
Agreed. Vaporise the earthling
and his wretched planet.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.730
<i>I told you so.</i>

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.770
Reprime the Destruction Generator.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.960
Try her again, Neil. Go on.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.520
- She... She won't have me.
- Then, give up the powers.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.410
- I can't.
- Then, give them to me.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.760
You wouldn't have the powers
but you'd know where they were.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.840
And being a dog,
all I want to do is follow orders.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.720
I'll do what you tell me to.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.520
- Dennis, you're a genius.
- Not bad, huh?

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.040
Destruction Generator already charged,
Death-Dealing Darkness-Bringer.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.680
<i>Commencing destruction.</i>

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.400
It is a curse that our numerals
take so long to pronounce.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.850
Uh, yeah, it's like, uh,
you just wave your hand, like that.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.400
I feel it. Wow!

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.360
Yeah. There you go.
So what's it going to be? Biscuits?

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.810
But the power made you miserable.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.440
Yeah, but I don't have them any more, do I?
Look, tree become Eiffel Tower.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.200
See?

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.120
What are you thinking, Dennis?

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.560
Forgive me, master.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.320
What? Wait, wait.
What are you going to do?

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.440
That's the only short one.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.640
If I have any power, let the source
of that power be destroyed, forever!

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.090
All this marking be suddenly finished
and neatly stacked up.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.040
Fiona Blackwell, go away.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.640
Oh, shh, shh. Shush, shush, shush.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.000
Fiona! How lovely to see you.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.600
Hey, great news. I got my sight back.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.480
Hey, I think I hear Catherine.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.720
- Catherine.
- Hi.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.800
Hey. Um, look. Letters become cucumbers.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.960
Us be on the prow of the <i>Titanic.</i>

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.120
I got rid of the powers.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.240
I'm impressed.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.560
Yeah. So I thought maybe
we could have some dinner sometime?

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.800
- Yeah, maybe, yeah.
- OK.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.520
- How about tonight?
- I'll be down in half an hour.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.760
We're going out to dinner.
I'll bring you both back a doggy bag.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.440
- I suppose I'd better keep my mouth shut.
- Turn me back, Den.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.640
I can't. I like you as you are.
Those stubby legs. Look at you.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.560
- I'm not a dog, I'm a man.
- Hey, nobody's perfect.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.280
This is chewing a biscuit, boss.
I'll try and give you that right now,

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.560
hold one second.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.360
Oh, red biscuit. Great.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.840
No! No!

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.680
Oh, got it.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.640
<i>Licking. Licking somebody.</i>

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.120
This is like porn. Now a shagging noise.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.440
Oh, look. There's the red bit.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.040
Oh, there, oh, right, oh...

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.520
I'm done.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.640
<i>OK, great.</i>

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.000
That's enough chewing biscuits
for fucking half an hour.
