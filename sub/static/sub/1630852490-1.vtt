There's Mars at Starpeace

02:48.760 --> 02:49.800
and Highteen.

02:49.820 --> 02:50.520
Right?

02:51.490 --> 02:54.040
Oh, no.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
I'm sorry.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.960
Don't be sorry about having no friends.

03:11.330 --> 03:13.460
I'm trying to help you out.

03:13.570 --> 03:15.330
I'm kind of disappointed.

03:15.350 --> 03:16.079

It's Cotton Candy.

03:26.040 --> 03:26.800
What did I say?

03:26.800 --> 03:28.600
- Cotton Candy.
- Oh, oh.

03:28.710 --> 03:31.900
See how failed idol groups are?

03:32.420 --> 03:34.030
The bulletin board is on fire.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.810
"Lemon is better than Cotton."

03:35.810 --> 03:38.070
"Lemon Candy sounds refreshing."

03:38.230 --> 03:39.750
"Caught-a-cold Candy?"

03:39.810 --> 03:41.790
"Looks like they tanked because of their name."

03:41.920 --> 03:43.100
See? See?

03:43.100 --> 03:45.700
I came up with a better name by chance.

03:45.770 --> 03:46.970
- Right?
- Yes.

04:00.580 --> 04:01.620
It's okay.

04:01.620 --> 04:02.580
- Right?
- Yes.

04:02.580 --> 04:03.650
The leader of failed idols.

04:03.650 --> 04:04.220
Yes.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.520
It's good to be a leader anywhere.

04:06.590 --> 04:08.780
How dare you run off with that money?

04:08.880 --> 04:10.460
I said I don't know anything!

04:10.460 --> 04:11.420
You witch!

04:11.420 --> 04:12.400
Hey!

04:12.420 --> 04:13.120
You!

04:13.120 --> 04:15.030
Give me back my money!

04:15.190 --> 04:17.209
- Help!
- Give me back my money!

04:17.790 --> 04:18.790
Anyway,

04:19.140 --> 04:21.490
we have a member of a failed idol group.

04:21.490 --> 04:22.610
Lemon, I mean,

04:22.640 --> 04:24.340
Cotton Candy!

04:24.600 --> 04:25.920
She's showing us

04:25.920 --> 04:28.270
what a truly failed idol group is like.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.120
But why did you come alone?

04:32.240 --> 04:34.200
The others didn't want to come, right?

04:34.320 --> 04:35.350
See?

04:35.350 --> 04:36.810
This is why you failed.

04:40.490 --> 04:42.750
Your team has gone to pieces, right?

04:42.750 --> 04:44.270
Shredded to pieces.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.320
Listen to this.

04:49.090 --> 04:50.900
Oh, we're...

04:50.990 --> 04:52.900
We're confetti.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.090
Confetti...

04:54.480 --> 04:56.159
What a sense of humor!

04:56.620 --> 04:58.190
This is why you failed.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.300
Because of a poor sense of humor.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.960
The bulletin board is on fire again.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.140
"Take her. Throw her out. Send her away."

05:08.510 --> 05:09.800
What's this?

05:10.460 --> 05:12.130
"Call Mars"?

05:12.540 --> 05:14.360
Come on, people.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.450
Mars is an A-list group. How can we call them?

05:17.510 --> 05:20.250
This is a channel for failed idol groups.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.720
Just call them?

05:21.810 --> 05:22.810
No.

05:23.060 --> 05:24.280
I can never

05:24.280 --> 05:25.560
call Mars, ever!

05:25.840 --> 05:27.660
How many members are in your group?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.120
Five.

05:29.190 --> 05:29.880
Five.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.270
Elle, Stella, Chae-ah, Hyun-ji

05:32.270 --> 05:33.590
and me, Jenna.

05:34.090 --> 05:34.750
Five.

05:34.750 --> 05:35.380
Elle.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.659
I can't remember all your names.

05:37.659 --> 05:39.780
People keep asking for Mars.

05:39.780 --> 05:40.980
Do you know their number?

05:40.980 --> 05:42.120
Can we call them?

05:42.220 --> 05:42.960
You don't know, do you?

05:42.960 --> 05:45.070
You guys, I'm sorry. We can't today.

05:45.070 --> 05:46.900
This is a channel for failed idol groups.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.740
This is just Lemon Candy.

05:48.740 --> 05:49.659
Cotton Candy.

05:49.659 --> 05:51.260
Oh, right. Cotton, cotton.

05:51.260 --> 05:53.170
But who cares if you failed, right?

05:53.170 --> 05:53.960
Be confident.

05:53.960 --> 05:54.950
It's not the end of the world.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.060
Yes, you're a failed idol singer.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.990
So what? What?

05:58.300 --> 05:59.120
Be confident.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.150
I think it's fine if you're confident.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.850
Yes! That's right!

06:02.870 --> 06:04.050
Right. Fight on.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.210
Good, let's go with this vibe.

06:06.210 --> 06:09.890
It's time to shout our show's key phrase.

06:09.890 --> 06:11.640
Repeat after me.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.680
I am

06:13.380 --> 06:14.680
a failed idol singer.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.740
I am

06:17.030 --> 06:18.020
a failed idol singer.

06:18.020 --> 06:18.750
No, no.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.350
Louder. Louder.

06:20.350 --> 06:21.330
With confidence.

06:21.330 --> 06:23.880
I am a failed idol singer!

06:25.250 --> 06:27.530
I am a failed idol singer!

06:28.860 --> 06:32.570
It's louder, but you still lack confidence.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.710
From the lower part of your belly.

06:34.710 --> 06:36.730
From your gut. Let's go.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.590
I am a failed idol singer!

06:43.050 --> 06:44.180
I am

06:44.850 --> 06:47.890
a failed idol singer!

06:54.840 --> 06:55.870
I am

06:56.440 --> 06:57.900
a failed idol singer.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.600
In this age where someone's pain

07:01.820 --> 07:03.930
becomes fodder for entertainment...

07:07.350 --> 07:10.860
In this age where effort is ridiculed...

07:12.960 --> 07:13.970
You're here.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.260
Hello.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.470
In this age

07:18.670 --> 07:20.340
that only remembers winners...

07:24.590 --> 07:26.450
In this cold-blooded age

07:27.110 --> 07:28.790
where winner takes all...

07:31.160 --> 07:34.030
We endure all that with everything we have.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.320
We are

07:36.040 --> 07:37.409
failed idol singers.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.420
Okay, we're wrapping up now.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.550
As we listen to the favorite song

07:41.550 --> 07:43.680
of Jenna, leader of Lemon Candy,

07:43.820 --> 07:45.240
we'll end the show.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.409
Say goodbye.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.280
It's Cotton Candy.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.200
Oh, right. You're obsessed with the name.

07:51.710 --> 07:53.520
I felt so happy today.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.280
Yes.

07:54.550 --> 07:56.480
I hope I can come here again some time.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.600
Yeah, well,

07:58.080 --> 07:59.940
I don't know if that'll be possible.

08:00.690 --> 08:03.770
But isn't "Lemon" better than "Cotton"?

08:06.890 --> 08:09.190
Anyway, this is Jenna's favorite song.

08:09.190 --> 08:10.870
BIG Naughty's "Home."

08:11.020 --> 08:13.130
It's a remix version.

08:13.490 --> 08:15.820
We'll say goodbye now. Good night!

08:15.990 --> 08:16.990
Thank you!

08:17.010 --> 08:17.630
- Okay.
- Yes.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.460
Bye! Jenna, bye!

08:19.460 --> 08:20.750
Fight on, failed idols!

08:20.750 --> 08:21.750
Fight on!

08:24.860 --> 08:27.330
A chance in front of me

08:27.330 --> 08:29.800
Even if I wander for a bit

08:29.800 --> 08:31.970
I'll find it

08:32.169 --> 08:34.669
At the end of this road, yeah

08:34.669 --> 08:37.309
Open up for me

08:37.309 --> 08:39.770
So when I return

08:39.770 --> 08:44.700
I can rest my weary heart, yeah

08:44.700 --> 08:45.310
Yeah

08:45.310 --> 08:47.720
Between birth and death, there are many choices

08:47.720 --> 08:50.280
Among them, many sweet voices seduce me

08:50.280 --> 08:52.420
The rope called success is just out of reach

08:52.420 --> 08:54.820
Even if it's a rotten rope, I won't let go

08:54.820 --> 08:57.330
Just become my home

08:57.330 --> 08:59.690
The burden surrounding me is heavy

08:59.690 --> 09:02.360
I bury my secrets I couldn't tell you

09:02.360 --> 09:04.130
Just let me stay alive

09:04.130 --> 09:06.030
It's all on me

09:06.030 --> 09:08.200
I jump up until I'm breathless

09:08.200 --> 09:11.610
Until I reach you

09:11.610 --> 09:14.040
I reach you

09:14.040 --> 09:15.940
It's all I'll be

09:15.940 --> 09:17.810
So I won't waver again

09:17.810 --> 09:21.520
Hold both my hands tight

09:21.520 --> 09:23.920
Hold them tight

09:24.920 --> 09:27.090
Your voice calling me

09:27.090 --> 09:29.830
I can hear it clearly

09:29.830 --> 09:32.290
The glitter in my eyes looking at you

09:32.290 --> 09:34.760
I hope it becomes our sign

09:34.760 --> 09:36.930
The shouts aimed toward me

09:36.930 --> 09:39.800
Knock on my heart

09:39.800 --> 09:41.900
My voice for you

09:41.900 --> 09:45.410
Just wait for us, We’re coming back home

09:47.190 --> 09:48.030
Good job.

09:48.030 --> 09:50.160
- Thank you.
- Good job.

09:50.350 --> 09:51.350
Thank you.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.320
But that's how you do the show?

09:56.380 --> 09:58.320
Did you come to ruin my show?

09:59.100 --> 10:00.590
Who does a show like that?

10:00.590 --> 10:01.870
"Yes. No."

10:01.990 --> 10:03.590
"Thank you. I'm sorry."

10:04.280 --> 10:06.420
You use up 30 minutes with that?

10:06.780 --> 10:08.050
Seong-gyu.

10:08.250 --> 10:11.440
How could you cast such a loser?

10:11.440 --> 10:12.880
Do your job right!

10:15.850 --> 10:17.040
I'm sorry.

10:19.790 --> 10:20.830
Writer Jeong.

10:20.850 --> 10:21.530
Hey.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.640
Our show will fail at this rate.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.770
Can you be responsible for the ratings?

10:26.060 --> 10:28.540
You do well, so it won't drop.

10:28.550 --> 10:29.810
Why should I carry

10:29.980 --> 10:34.240
extra burden like her on my shoulders?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.790
Do better.

10:36.050 --> 10:37.950
People fail

10:38.260 --> 10:41.280
for a reason.

10:42.740 --> 10:43.740
Right?

10:44.870 --> 10:46.120
I'm sorry.

Du-ho

11:48.650 --> 11:49.650
Hi, Du-ho.

11:49.920 --> 11:50.920
Is it done?

11:51.430 --> 11:53.070
Sorry, I didn't get to listen in.

11:53.730 --> 11:54.730
I did well.

11:55.030 --> 11:56.030
It was fun.

11:56.350 --> 11:57.350
Great.

11:57.810 --> 12:00.340
The DJ and writer there are your fans.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.850
They asked for you first thing.

12:04.630 --> 12:05.630
Really?

12:06.260 --> 12:07.620
How nice of them.

12:09.030 --> 12:11.160
Sorry I couldn't go pick you up.

12:12.630 --> 12:14.840
You take care of your group.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.280
You're not our manager anymore.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.570
I'm trying to find some gigs you can do.

12:21.110 --> 12:22.110
Good job.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.240
- Good job.
- Good job.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.200
- Ta-da!
- Hi.

12:28.350 --> 12:29.350
What's this?

12:30.490 --> 12:32.130
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

12:32.130 --> 12:33.610
Looks great.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.760
Is she an idol singer?

12:34.940 --> 12:36.250
How much does she cost?

12:36.460 --> 12:37.390
A new face?

12:37.390 --> 12:38.520
An old face.

12:38.610 --> 12:39.610
She tanked.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.310
Is the schedule out for

12:58.310 --> 12:59.870
the recording we talked about?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.290
They say next week, or the week after that,

13:02.290 --> 13:03.950
then decide after the script is out.

13:04.120 --> 13:04.890
Call me.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.490
Bye. Good job today.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.780
Do you do singing jobs?

13:13.300 --> 13:14.300
How much?

13:14.900 --> 13:16.190
Next week is my birthday.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.580
I'm having a huge party.

13:17.710 --> 13:18.890
Sing three songs for me.

13:18.970 --> 13:19.970
Hey, hey!

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
Hey!

13:24.060 --> 13:26.850
I'm not someone you can ignore.

13:27.090 --> 13:28.810
Don't you know Hwarang Pharmaceutical?

13:28.810 --> 13:31.010
The chairman is my dad and I'm...

13:31.470 --> 13:32.400
Lunatic.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.690
Lunatic? Hey!

13:33.690 --> 13:34.260
Hey!

13:34.280 --> 13:35.060
Forget it.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.060
Let go!

13:43.720 --> 13:45.140
What a loser...

13:51.260 --> 13:53.140
Hyun-ji

14:00.570 --> 14:01.570
Elle.

14:02.270 --> 14:05.320
You hear Jenna humiliating us on the radio?

14:05.640 --> 14:07.420
She must be insane.

14:08.330 --> 14:10.530
We told her not to do it.

14:11.150 --> 14:14.400
We distinctly told her not to do it.

14:17.010 --> 14:18.010
Didn't we?

14:18.030 --> 14:18.840
We did.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.880
Right?

14:20.310 --> 14:21.400
We did!

14:23.020 --> 14:25.930
Then why'd she go and humiliate us?

14:27.710 --> 14:29.890
She came out of the pocket

14:29.890 --> 14:32.330
saying we're a failure.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.580
Or is it coming out of the closet?

14:36.270 --> 14:37.650
Elle.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.790
I hate it.

14:42.450 --> 14:44.510
Why are we a failed idol group?

14:47.650 --> 14:49.190
Did we fail?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.200
Did we?

14:53.750 --> 14:55.100
We did, right?

14:56.190 --> 14:58.530
We failed a long time ago.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.620
Four years ago?

15:01.610 --> 15:02.610
Five?

15:03.490 --> 15:04.490
But...

15:04.920 --> 15:08.260
But why haven't we broken up?

15:12.130 --> 15:13.760
We're still bound by the contract.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.060
CEO Ma, that bastard.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.840
He threw us aside because we failed

15:20.840 --> 15:22.920
but he's holding on to us

15:22.920 --> 15:25.000
because of the contract.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.510
So he's the problem, right?

15:33.510 --> 15:35.780
The reason Jenna is

15:35.810 --> 15:37.720
humiliating us on the radio

15:37.750 --> 15:39.520
is also because of him.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.880
The reason I'm wasted is

15:42.900 --> 15:44.690
because of him, too.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.970
- I'm hanging up now.
- No!

15:48.700 --> 15:50.370
Come get me.

15:50.370 --> 15:52.340
What? Call Jenna.

15:52.340 --> 15:53.970
No!

15:54.510 --> 15:56.380
I don't need that self-disgracing jerk.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.090
I'm hanging up.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.630
If you don't come get me,

15:58.630 --> 16:00.620
they'll eat me alive!

16:00.620 --> 16:01.310
Hey!

16:08.450 --> 16:09.300
Darn it!

16:44.740 --> 16:45.740
Jenna?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.130
I thought Elle was coming.

16:47.130 --> 16:48.720
How much did she drink?

16:54.440 --> 16:56.710
Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji, get up.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.770
Huh? Wake up.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.160
I don't need you, self-disgracing jerk.

17:02.460 --> 17:04.220
Why are we failed idol singers?

17:04.220 --> 17:05.540
I'll call the staff.

17:07.140 --> 17:07.960
Oh.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.829
This is Hyun-ji's part-time pay.

17:14.630 --> 17:16.810
This is the prize for the best dancer.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.240
Don't worry about the bill.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.050
A VIP of this club paid it,

17:25.050 --> 17:26.770
captivated by her dancing.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.480
What about you?

17:29.730 --> 17:31.040
Don't worry.

17:31.530 --> 17:32.630
I'll call the staff.

17:36.670 --> 17:38.730
Self-disgracing jerk.

17:44.060 --> 17:45.230
- Hyun-ji.
- Yeah?

17:45.420 --> 17:46.410
Come on.

17:46.580 --> 17:47.580
Lie this way.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.930
Your wave movements are too sharp.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.870
What's all this?

18:13.150 --> 18:14.150
You're here.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.550
Is she drunk again?

18:21.360 --> 18:22.360
Yeah.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.370
I missed the show because of a shoot.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.120
You must've worked hard alone.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.760
Sorry.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.560
I did totally well.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.290
I'm glad.

18:36.770 --> 18:37.770
Wash up.

18:37.970 --> 18:39.180
You must be tired.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.290
Star...

18:55.760 --> 18:59.110
Some people fail for a reason.

18:59.550 --> 19:00.550
Right?

19:03.070 --> 19:04.070
Beats me.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.390
If you know the reason, then tell me.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.570
We got No.1 on the search word list.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.870
For Caught-a-cold Candy.

19:29.170 --> 19:30.290
We said no.

19:31.310 --> 19:32.310
I said no.

19:32.770 --> 19:35.440
Hyun-ji and Chae-ah all strongly said no.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.560
So lets hear it.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.930
What did you get for going on that show?

19:44.140 --> 19:45.240
The reason I insisted on it...

19:45.240 --> 19:46.240
I know.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.050
So we wouldn't be forgotten.

19:48.990 --> 19:50.530
That's why you've been doing

19:50.530 --> 19:51.880
pointless things for years.

19:54.070 --> 19:55.070
I know.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.450
But you should know something, too.

20:01.290 --> 20:03.750
What's the use of not being forgotten

20:03.830 --> 20:05.700
when no one is listening to our songs?

20:19.820 --> 20:20.820
Do you

20:22.610 --> 20:26.180
really think we'll get another chance?

21:27.150 --> 21:27.920
Cot!

21:27.920 --> 21:28.550
Ton!

21:28.550 --> 21:29.100
Can!

21:29.100 --> 21:29.680
Dy!

21:29.680 --> 21:30.540
Fight on!

21:31.920 --> 21:33.220
My babies!

21:33.520 --> 21:34.630
Fight on! Fight on!

21:34.630 --> 21:36.230
Jenna, do as you've always done.

21:38.240 --> 21:38.850
Fight on!

21:39.320 --> 21:39.840
Fight on!

21:39.840 --> 21:40.350
Fight on! Fight on!

21:40.350 --> 21:41.760
Fight on!

21:53.260 --> 21:55.190
The third week of March, 2016!

21:55.410 --> 21:58.290
The rising star chosen by Music Tank's newbie round.

21:58.370 --> 22:00.710
It's their debut performance today.

22:00.850 --> 22:03.310
Five unique girls that make your heart flutter!

22:03.430 --> 22:05.330
It's Cotton Candy!

22:05.440 --> 22:06.440
"White Day"!

22:06.510 --> 22:08.750
Cotton Candy debut
Let's be successful!

22:26.370 --> 22:30.210
Can you feel this trembling?

22:30.410 --> 22:35.000
Do you feel the same way?

22:35.070 --> 22:39.760
Time has stopped as if I'm in a dream

22:41.100 --> 22:43.750
Is this love?

22:45.720 --> 22:49.050
I look around, and lovers are everywhere

22:49.120 --> 22:53.300
I was sad that I was alone

22:54.940 --> 22:58.270
Then I saw you by my side

22:58.500 --> 23:02.450
Now I realize

23:02.450 --> 23:04.230
Into my small world

23:04.230 --> 23:07.140
You came like a big gift

23:07.140 --> 23:08.760
In a sparkling moment

23:08.760 --> 23:12.120
My white first love came to me

23:12.430 --> 23:14.840
Worried you might read my heart

23:14.840 --> 23:17.980
or how much I've been waiting for today

23:18.190 --> 23:21.420
I want your white day love

23:43.410 --> 23:44.320
I'm so happy!

23:44.320 --> 23:45.740
Cotton Candy!

23:45.950 --> 23:47.410
My babies!

23:47.410 --> 23:49.330
You're the best!

23:53.240 --> 23:54.830
We debuted!

23:54.830 --> 23:56.230
Good job! Good job!

23:56.230 --> 23:58.070
Sir! Oh, my gosh!

23:58.070 --> 23:59.990
We really debuted!

24:03.950 --> 24:05.670
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

24:05.670 --> 24:06.870
Cheers!

24:07.190 --> 24:08.180
Cotton Candy!

24:08.180 --> 24:10.330
- Fight on!
- Fight on!

24:13.280 --> 24:14.200
Hey, you guys.

24:15.630 --> 24:17.020
You have a fan site.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.530
- Huh?
- Really?

24:18.560 --> 24:19.790
Let me see.

24:20.030 --> 24:20.990
Look!

24:20.990 --> 24:21.980
Look at this.

24:22.530 --> 24:23.690
Wow, twenty-five!

24:24.210 --> 24:25.470
Twenty-five!

24:25.820 --> 24:27.210
Twenty-five!

24:27.370 --> 24:28.940
Twenty-five!

24:36.370 --> 24:37.890
Cotton Candy Official Fan Site

24:36.860 --> 24:38.240
A video has been uploaded.

24:39.370 --> 24:41.590
Stella is so pretty.
What does it feel like to live like her?

24:49.060 --> 24:49.860
What?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.070
Are there only mean comments?

24:52.190 --> 24:53.990
Everyone thinks we'll fail?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.850
Can my face go public like this?

25:07.610 --> 25:08.390
Stella.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
Look at me.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.750
Are you happy today or not?

25:14.110 --> 25:15.110
I'm happy.

25:20.860 --> 25:21.840
Let's say the chant.

25:22.340 --> 25:24.610
I'm not unfortunate.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.710
- I won't let...
- I won't let...

25:28.150 --> 25:29.920
- ...my world be shaken...
- ...my world be shaken...

25:30.020 --> 25:31.990
- ...by something else.
- ...by something else.

25:33.110 --> 25:35.350
Your life is yours.

25:36.530 --> 25:38.210
Nothing can shake it.

25:44.980 --> 25:45.980
Increase.

25:46.530 --> 25:47.530
Increase.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.080
Huh?

25:49.540 --> 25:50.540
Twenty-six!

25:51.490 --> 25:52.510
What did your mom say?

25:52.690 --> 25:53.730
Did she call?

25:54.310 --> 25:55.080
Huh?

25:56.080 --> 25:57.120
Yeah...

25:57.730 --> 25:58.650
She did.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.860
She watched our performance.

26:02.270 --> 26:03.050
That's it?

26:03.990 --> 26:06.260
She's so stingy.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.390
You're mom is so...

26:10.650 --> 26:11.360
Huh?

26:15.540 --> 26:16.700
Hi, Grandma!

26:16.950 --> 26:18.920
Did you see me on TV?

26:19.230 --> 26:20.040
You did?

26:20.540 --> 26:21.700
I was pretty, right?

26:22.320 --> 26:24.930
Did you brag to everyone back home?

26:28.310 --> 26:29.790
Good.

26:30.420 --> 26:31.420
Grandma.

26:32.590 --> 26:33.710
Hang in there.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.790
I'll become famous quickly

26:37.970 --> 26:40.300
and send you a truck-load of money.

26:41.580 --> 26:44.060
Oh, and get cable TV.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.600
No, cable.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.480
Forget it.

26:52.870 --> 26:54.610
I'll tell the village head

26:55.140 --> 26:56.740
to get you cable TV.

27:00.430 --> 27:01.820
Okay.

27:04.830 --> 27:06.280
Of course I eat well.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.600
Don't skip meals and eat well, okay?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.410
I eat till I burst.

27:12.950 --> 27:14.050
Yeah!

27:14.850 --> 27:15.970
Okay.

27:17.470 --> 27:20.210
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.160
Your grandma

27:24.670 --> 27:26.450
sounds like she'll have a village feast.

27:29.870 --> 27:31.980
I'm going to succeed,

27:33.090 --> 27:35.420
and bathe my grandma in luxury.

28:09.130 --> 28:12.450
March 14, 2016
Commemorating Cotton Candy's debut

28:10.750 --> 28:11.750
Jenna!

28:12.190 --> 28:13.610
Mom! Mom!

28:13.610 --> 28:14.380
Hey!

28:14.380 --> 28:16.070
Why are you calling me "mom?"

28:16.820 --> 28:18.070
Stella, she's weird!

28:18.070 --> 28:19.820
Unbelievable.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.960
I never thought about the past,

28:22.960 --> 28:24.320
But I was reminded today.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.960
When I was at the orphanage,

28:26.960 --> 28:29.160
you came to do volunteer work.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.260
You hated me then.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.170
I pretended to because my pride was hurt.

28:36.230 --> 28:38.220
You were playing games?

28:40.610 --> 28:41.890
Thank you

28:46.000 --> 28:48.470
for visiting when I lived with my grandma.

28:50.970 --> 28:52.540
I'm really

28:53.900 --> 28:55.920
going to be world-famous

28:56.350 --> 28:58.710
and make everyone envy me.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.220
That's my dream.

29:01.550 --> 29:03.570
So you all need to cooperate.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.040
Okay.

29:07.060 --> 29:07.920
Let's do it.

29:08.530 --> 29:11.050
Let's become world-famous.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.320
- Okay?
- Okay.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.470
Why do you have an odd expression?

29:27.140 --> 29:28.350
It's my previous group.

29:29.740 --> 29:32.140
Congratulating my debut, cursing me,

29:32.500 --> 29:33.600
throwing bombs at me.

29:34.810 --> 29:36.080
They say, "Go kill yourself."

29:37.710 --> 29:39.180
That's harsh.

29:41.290 --> 29:42.730
I'm the harsh one.

29:44.470 --> 29:45.450
Don't you think so?

29:51.200 --> 29:53.250
What do you think about when you see me?

29:54.810 --> 29:55.810
'Traitor.'

29:58.520 --> 30:00.200
'The first time is hard.'

30:00.970 --> 30:02.900
'It'll be easier after that.'

30:04.330 --> 30:06.010
'How can I trust her?'

30:06.580 --> 30:07.840
Being nervous like that.

30:08.100 --> 30:08.990
Hey.

30:13.930 --> 30:16.270
Where do you think the end of this road is?

30:18.610 --> 30:19.610
I think

30:20.430 --> 30:22.880
it's when everyone knows my song

30:23.440 --> 30:24.640
and sings it.

30:25.540 --> 30:26.280
Hey.

30:26.830 --> 30:29.410
Everyone knows Arirang and the national anthem.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.190
You're all-around good,

30:32.320 --> 30:33.910
but as a leader, that's your problem.

30:33.910 --> 30:34.720
What is?

30:36.350 --> 30:38.030
Having vague ambition.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.130
It's not vague.

30:45.740 --> 30:46.740
Look.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.490
I'm going to be like that.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.350
A star you can see anywhere in the world.

30:56.390 --> 30:57.910
I'm going to be like that star.

30:58.810 --> 30:59.740
No matter what.

31:01.410 --> 31:03.010
Okay, let's do that.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.130
That one?

31:05.590 --> 31:06.130
Yeah.

31:06.980 --> 31:09.180
Should we buy that building, too?

31:11.150 --> 31:11.920
Okay.

31:15.570 --> 31:17.320
Narsha's Music Canvas

31:27.100 --> 31:28.890
Hard to believe

31:29.270 --> 31:32.050
Your embrace is like warm sunshine

31:32.050 --> 31:34.300
I had been just looking at you

31:34.300 --> 31:36.260
Now we are

31:37.100 --> 31:38.460
How can we leave?

31:39.130 --> 31:41.930
You came into my arms gently

31:42.050 --> 31:44.240
It's like a dream I've been imagining every day

31:44.240 --> 31:46.460
You know I

31:47.360 --> 31:49.900
Up in the sky, anywhere you want to go

31:50.260 --> 31:53.030
Baby I'm ready to go with you

31:53.030 --> 31:53.980
(Hold me tight)

31:53.980 --> 31:55.170
Holding your hands

31:55.170 --> 31:57.640
I feel so right, alright

31:57.640 --> 31:59.960
With you smiling at me

31:59.960 --> 32:02.310
I want to stay in this moment

32:02.310 --> 32:07.710
Every day, every day, you shine anew

32:07.710 --> 32:08.800
Babe,

32:09.030 --> 32:14.300
I can't believe all this

32:14.300 --> 32:17.750
I am walking on the clouds

32:17.750 --> 32:21.220
Stay just like you do now

32:21.220 --> 32:24.570
Stand by my side

32:24.860 --> 32:26.410
Right here, Cloud-Nine

32:26.410 --> 32:31.840
I can take you higher

32:31.840 --> 32:34.010
To another cloud higher than

32:34.010 --> 32:36.410
the cloud you see there

32:36.420 --> 32:41.450
I can take you higher

32:41.790 --> 32:46.350
The ninth big cloud over there

32:59.820 --> 33:01.240
Shawty I'm your hero

33:01.240 --> 33:02.500
Whenever and wherever you are,

33:02.500 --> 33:04.650
I'll be there if you want

33:04.950 --> 33:07.480
Like a superpower, you keep pulling me

33:07.480 --> 33:09.360
Even for a minute and a second, be with me

33:09.360 --> 33:11.870
Met like destiny, You and I

33:11.870 --> 33:14.930
You fill up my empty heart

33:14.930 --> 33:16.260
With just your smile

33:16.260 --> 33:17.780
"I can do this all day"

33:17.780 --> 33:18.730
Just for you

33:18.730 --> 33:20.190
Super power on my mind

33:20.190 --> 33:23.850
With you

33:23.850 --> 33:26.780
who came into my world

33:26.810 --> 33:30.200
I walk on the clouds

33:30.200 --> 33:33.720
Shine like that

33:33.720 --> 33:37.190
Please keep shining brightly

33:37.400 --> 33:38.880
Right here, this is Cloud-Nine

33:38.880 --> 33:44.320
I can take you higher

33:44.320 --> 33:46.480
To another cloud higher than

33:46.500 --> 33:48.660
the cloud you see there

33:48.820 --> 33:54.240
I can take you higher

33:54.240 --> 34:00.650
The ninth big cloud over there (Cloud-Nine)

34:01.100 --> 34:05.040
My eyes are only for you

34:06.080 --> 34:10.239
My everything exists for you

34:10.239 --> 34:11.199
Why

34:11.199 --> 34:13.440
Now that I know you

34:13.650 --> 34:17.389
After I got to know you (oh baby)

34:17.389 --> 34:19.280
You let me in your sky, High-

34:19.280 --> 34:24.360
I can take you higher

34:24.360 --> 34:26.489
To another cloud higher than

34:26.510 --> 34:28.719
the cloud you see there

34:28.719 --> 34:34.340
I can take you higher

34:34.340 --> 34:38.590
The ninth big cloud over there

34:38.590 --> 34:40.469
Cloud-Nine

34:44.130 --> 34:45.810
You guys are so awesome.

34:46.060 --> 34:47.330
Please have a seat.

34:47.330 --> 34:48.159
Thank you.

34:48.159 --> 34:48.909
Wow.

34:48.909 --> 34:50.030
Thanks for the performance.

34:50.030 --> 34:51.139
Please have a seat.

34:53.880 --> 34:54.710
Okay.

34:56.590 --> 34:58.100
From the band arrangement version

34:58.100 --> 35:00.190
to the original performance version,

35:00.190 --> 35:03.090
I feel like I've been served a perfect meal.

35:03.120 --> 35:06.100
The first half of the year was great for you.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.580
I heard you're having a brief hiatus soon.

35:09.580 --> 35:12.980
Do you, meticulous Tae-young, have any plans?

35:14.040 --> 35:16.710
I'm going to rest up meticulously.

35:17.030 --> 35:19.230
- What about our sweet guy?
- Me?

35:19.420 --> 35:23.020
I'm staying at home.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.410
What about our youngest?

35:26.210 --> 35:27.730
This old soul

35:28.180 --> 35:30.950
will be a bear in hibernation.

35:32.870 --> 35:36.390
I heard Ji-han and Ray are preparing a unit?

35:36.440 --> 35:37.440
Yes.

35:39.110 --> 35:46.020
Unit! Unit! Unit!

35:46.020 --> 35:48.420
We're sorry we'll be taking a break without them.

36:05.170 --> 36:07.410
- Mars!
- Calla!

36:07.470 --> 36:13.290
Marscalla! Marscalla!

36:13.830 --> 36:17.590
Mars and Calla sound good separately.

36:17.590 --> 36:18.410
Yeah.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.850
With Mars and the flower calla combined,

36:19.850 --> 36:21.890
I thought it'd be a second Earth.

36:22.670 --> 36:24.370
But it sounds more like "mascara."

36:24.370 --> 36:25.710
Good job.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.550
- Good job.
- Good job.

36:28.450 --> 36:29.090
Hey.

36:29.850 --> 36:31.050
Where's CEO Ma?

36:39.780 --> 36:41.180
Oh. You're here.

36:41.350 --> 36:43.010
Bbiyong? Hi.

36:43.800 --> 36:44.540
Hey.

36:44.730 --> 36:46.070
Do we have to do the unit?

36:46.380 --> 36:47.710
Just do it for one month.

36:48.130 --> 36:50.060
Then I'll let you rest all you want.

36:51.100 --> 36:52.330
We don't have a song.

36:52.810 --> 36:53.810
What's he talking about?

36:53.840 --> 36:54.770
Oh.

36:54.790 --> 36:56.210
He says the songs we have

36:56.210 --> 36:58.170
overlap with the vibe of our group album.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.760
Then I'll give you songs that don't overlap.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.560
Bbiyong brought some.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.790
I want to do my own songs.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.090
Then use something you already have.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.240
This isn't new. Why the sudden fuss?

37:15.440 --> 37:16.800
The entire album.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.510
So let's do the unit next time.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.920
When I'm ready.

37:21.420 --> 37:24.320
Ji-han, when water comes in, you have to row.

37:24.590 --> 37:26.830
Why are you just thinking about yourself?

37:36.740 --> 37:38.930
You know when a person feels unhappy

37:38.930 --> 37:40.760
once their stomach doesn't go empty?

37:42.160 --> 37:43.580
When they realize what they want

37:43.930 --> 37:46.130
to do is not what they're good at.

37:47.380 --> 37:48.850
If you do what you're good at,

37:48.850 --> 37:50.330
you'll be happy.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.860
But you go askew and

37:53.690 --> 37:55.070
fuss about.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.480
Then what am I good at?

38:02.210 --> 38:03.890
The public wants you.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.120
You have alluring charm.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.720
That's your talent.

38:17.330 --> 38:18.330
Ji-han!

38:20.450 --> 38:21.400
Ji-han!

38:22.800 --> 38:23.800
Ji-han!

38:27.000 --> 38:28.200
Alluring charm?

38:28.650 --> 38:30.610
You know he didn't really mean it.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.020
Huh?

38:34.290 --> 38:35.290
I heard

38:35.810 --> 38:38.030
Ji-han butts his head more these days.

38:38.700 --> 38:39.620
Seriously.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.960
When they succeed, they think it's all them.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.520
But so many people shed blood and tears

38:44.520 --> 38:45.910
supporting them.

38:46.170 --> 38:47.880
You're getting annoyed often, Director Yoon.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.790
You're showing how you're not right for this job.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.210
Hey.

38:54.230 --> 38:55.140
What?

38:55.140 --> 38:56.460
Get me medicine from the drawer.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.410
Medicine?

38:57.410 --> 38:58.160
Why?

38:58.490 --> 38:59.960
Are you sick?

39:00.360 --> 39:01.200
Your heart?

39:01.480 --> 39:02.840
Stop it. Stop.

39:02.860 --> 39:03.610
Where is it?

39:03.610 --> 39:05.720
CEO Cha Jae-hyuk comes two days later, right?

39:05.980 --> 39:07.720
Check the route from his plane ride

39:08.120 --> 39:10.480
to his accommodation and the restaurants.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.630
It's the tenth time I'm doing that.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.250
He's so picky.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.120
We only spoke over the phone,

39:18.120 --> 39:20.100
but he's so off-putting.

39:20.750 --> 39:23.130
Don't talk behind people's backs.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.940
Why are you so on edge these days?

39:31.010 --> 39:32.050
I don't know.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.570
I'm a bit tired.

39:34.650 --> 39:35.760
Is the song an excuse?

39:35.760 --> 39:37.210
Maybe.

39:37.370 --> 39:38.560
Maybe not.

39:39.250 --> 39:41.050
"Do this, do that."

39:42.180 --> 39:43.570
I'm getting tired of hearing that.

39:43.570 --> 39:45.250
It's okay to get tired.

39:45.670 --> 39:47.870
So many kids want to be where you are.

39:51.910 --> 39:52.790
Hand it over.

39:53.120 --> 39:53.860
What?

39:55.300 --> 39:57.300
The song you got from Bbiyong.

40:00.570 --> 40:01.710
He said it's our title song.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.630
If it's bad, cover it up with your alluring charm.

40:04.630 --> 40:05.740
There's no other choice.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.620
Bbiyong is hanging in the balance these days.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.120
They said he was a genius.

40:09.710 --> 40:10.710
I guess not.

40:18.530 --> 40:19.810
- You're going out?
- Yes.

40:20.150 --> 40:22.020
What you asked last night...

40:23.490 --> 40:26.020
If I think we'll get another chance...

40:27.080 --> 40:28.440
My answer is yes.

40:29.740 --> 40:31.200
It was a rhetorical question.

40:33.570 --> 40:34.570
My answer

40:35.530 --> 40:36.530
is yes.

40:38.030 --> 40:39.380
So to get that chance,

40:39.380 --> 40:41.020
I'm going to do whatever I can.

40:46.210 --> 40:47.210
Okay.

40:48.110 --> 40:49.270
You do that.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.120
I'll live my way.

40:55.690 --> 40:57.370
In six months,

40:58.760 --> 41:01.030
we'll go our separate ways anyway.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.160
This early?

41:22.660 --> 41:23.460
Hi, Du-ho.

41:23.460 --> 41:24.600
He's here again.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.540
You can't block the entrance.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.050
Pull out your car!

41:28.670 --> 41:30.660
I told you not to come here. Why keep coming?

41:30.660 --> 41:31.720
Pull out your car now.

41:31.720 --> 41:32.550
I'm sorry.

41:32.550 --> 41:33.240
I'm sorry.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
Seriously.

41:35.130 --> 41:36.540
You slept in front of the bank again?

41:36.540 --> 41:38.950
No other place wakes me up so solidly.

41:40.420 --> 41:41.100
I have to go now.

41:41.100 --> 41:42.210
What if you get into an accident,

41:42.210 --> 41:44.110
sleeping in snippets?

41:44.490 --> 41:46.170
You'll get in trouble.

41:46.370 --> 41:47.170
Oh, right.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.360
The gig I told you about the other time.

41:49.790 --> 41:50.850
It's almost in the bag.

41:51.220 --> 41:52.400
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:55.610 --> 41:57.090
Call me. Okay.

41:57.390 --> 41:58.120
Bye.

42:02.500 --> 42:05.150
If Mr. Chubby keeps scheduling trash gigs,

42:05.150 --> 42:06.420
tell him to quit.

42:07.820 --> 42:08.820
Hyun-ji.

42:13.550 --> 42:15.530
Why go on that show and humiliate yourself?

42:15.870 --> 42:19.050
We might really break up because of you.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.140
Even if we do something else,

42:21.380 --> 42:23.300
the title "failed idol group" will follow us.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.990
Will you be responsible for my life?

42:24.990 --> 42:26.250
How can you say that?

42:26.250 --> 42:28.440
Think about how much Jenna has gone through alone.

42:29.830 --> 42:31.580
Why break up?

42:32.770 --> 42:35.100
Hyun-ji, Du-ho says he'll get us a gig.

42:37.630 --> 42:39.610
How many times has it been already?

42:39.830 --> 42:42.290
How many times has it fallen through?

42:44.200 --> 42:45.870
Do you still believe him?

42:46.030 --> 42:48.070
He's not even our manager now.

42:48.070 --> 42:50.020
Tell him to take care of Highteen.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.930
Why are you so bitter?

42:52.560 --> 42:53.650
I think

42:54.650 --> 42:57.350
we failed because of Jenna's naiveté.

42:57.350 --> 42:59.360
What nonsense is that?

43:10.600 --> 43:12.630
Hello? Asst. Manager Park!

43:12.920 --> 43:13.640
Yes.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.190
Huh?

43:16.370 --> 43:17.220
Oh!

43:18.540 --> 43:19.900
I'll go meet you.

43:23.530 --> 43:24.290
Jenna.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.180
Hello.

43:27.550 --> 43:28.270
Why are you here?

43:29.020 --> 43:30.960
To say hello. It's been a long time.

43:31.990 --> 43:33.460
It hasn't been a long time.

43:33.890 --> 43:35.300
I heard you came last week, too.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.900
You went to the PR team and project team,

43:38.930 --> 43:41.080
asking for gigs that got rejected.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.820
I told you the staff feels uncomfortable.

43:44.060 --> 43:44.890
I'm sorry.

43:44.890 --> 43:46.630
If there is a gig, we'll give it to you.

43:49.820 --> 43:50.630
Jenna.

43:51.610 --> 43:52.730
Isn't it hard?

43:54.060 --> 43:56.110
Trying to hold the five of you together.

43:56.110 --> 43:57.050
Isn't it hard?

43:57.520 --> 43:58.520
Even we

43:59.350 --> 44:01.030
can't handle Hyun-ji.

44:03.310 --> 44:04.430
It's not hard.

44:07.650 --> 44:08.430
Right.

44:08.790 --> 44:09.820
Of course it isn't.

44:09.820 --> 44:10.620
Why would it be?

44:10.620 --> 44:13.050
If it was, you wouldn't be able to do this.

44:15.640 --> 44:16.640
Jenna.

44:18.050 --> 44:20.400
A friend of mine opened up an agency.

44:20.540 --> 44:21.880
He asked about you.

44:22.610 --> 44:23.990
He's forming a group of seven.

44:24.010 --> 44:26.680
Two will be filled from existing groups.

44:26.850 --> 44:28.390
He remembered you first.

44:28.530 --> 44:29.530
Come on.

44:30.260 --> 44:31.860
Get it when you can.

44:32.490 --> 44:33.630
You're not that young.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.740
1-2 years will pass in the blink of an eye.

44:35.920 --> 44:38.200
I want things to work out for you.

44:43.610 --> 44:45.380
Hello.

44:48.930 --> 44:50.090
Asst. Manager Park!

44:50.090 --> 44:51.450
- Hi, Jenna.
- Hello.

44:51.780 --> 44:53.220
Wow, thanks. So quick-witted.

44:53.220 --> 44:54.440
- Where to?
- To conference room No.2

44:54.440 --> 44:55.090
Okay.

44:55.090 --> 44:57.620
It's the promo meeting for Highteen's new goods.

44:58.410 --> 45:00.340
They're at the top of rookies, right?

45:00.500 --> 45:03.210
I'm swamped because of them these days.

45:04.370 --> 45:05.720
Phew. Thanks.

45:06.280 --> 45:07.640
I said I'll call.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.240
Why did you come all the way here?

45:09.510 --> 45:10.860
Of course I should come.

45:11.230 --> 45:13.360
What did you want to talk about?

45:14.290 --> 45:15.390
Well...

45:15.540 --> 45:18.210
Do you want to do a small signing event?

45:18.680 --> 45:19.800
Signing event?

45:19.970 --> 45:23.320
My apartment complex is having a get-together.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.320
We'll do it.

45:24.390 --> 45:26.570
I'm grateful if you'll do it,

45:26.900 --> 45:28.160
but there's no pay.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.080
Oh, that's okay.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.360
You'll tell the agency?

45:32.360 --> 45:35.190
It's okay. The agency doesn't have you in mind...

45:37.250 --> 45:38.660
I mean, uh...

45:38.910 --> 45:39.820
I'll tell them.

45:39.850 --> 45:40.850
I will.

45:42.030 --> 45:44.160
I'll text you the details later.

45:45.050 --> 45:45.850
Okay.

45:46.490 --> 45:47.930
- I'll be going now.
- Okay.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.180
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

45:49.180 --> 45:49.960
Bye.

45:49.960 --> 45:50.990
- I won't walk you out.
- Okay.

45:50.990 --> 45:52.350
Thank you.

45:54.270 --> 45:56.320
See? I told you she'd do it.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.460
I feel bad.

45:58.460 --> 45:59.890
Why?

45:59.890 --> 46:02.390
They'll break up after the contract is over.

46:03.490 --> 46:06.760
Cotton Candy
Revenue and Expenditure Report

46:04.850 --> 46:07.730
Early breakup of Cotton Candy has come up again.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.480
What will you do?

46:13.690 --> 46:15.380
The cancellation fee isn't that big.

46:15.380 --> 46:17.410
If we take the dorm and rent it out,

46:17.410 --> 46:20.100
we'll get more than what they're earning.

46:20.450 --> 46:21.570
Come to a decision.

46:22.060 --> 46:25.200
If we make them leave now, where will they go?

46:27.700 --> 46:29.660
We should give them time to find something else.

46:29.660 --> 46:30.530
Yes.

46:30.660 --> 46:31.980
They should do that.

46:32.230 --> 46:33.820
But they aren't. That's the problem.

46:34.680 --> 46:36.260
Jenna came by the agency again.

46:36.390 --> 46:37.800
She's trying to grab leftover gigs.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.380
Watch your language!

46:44.530 --> 46:46.070
They're your first team

46:46.070 --> 46:48.290
so I know it's the finger that hurts the most.

46:48.340 --> 46:51.250
I know that's why you can't decide.

46:51.610 --> 46:53.710
But when CEO Cha comes as co-president,

46:53.710 --> 46:55.010
they'll get cut anyway.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.190
He's calculative.

46:57.700 --> 46:59.380
He won't let them stay.

47:05.180 --> 47:06.610
Move.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.900
Why pretend he's all cold?

47:13.670 --> 47:15.280
Hello, Sir.

47:15.660 --> 47:17.540
Oh, long time no see.

47:19.660 --> 47:21.030
The girls are doing well, right?

47:21.270 --> 47:22.470
How could they be?

47:26.580 --> 47:27.640
See you next time.

47:28.190 --> 47:29.190
Sir.

47:29.920 --> 47:30.740
Umm...

47:31.510 --> 47:33.580
I sent you two songs via email.

47:34.200 --> 47:36.140
But you haven't read it yet.

47:37.210 --> 47:37.850
Jenna.

47:37.850 --> 47:38.660
Alright.

47:41.950 --> 47:43.340
Don't do that.

47:45.480 --> 47:46.480
Jenna.

47:47.110 --> 47:48.110
Du-ho!

47:51.210 --> 47:52.060
Why are you here?

47:52.060 --> 47:54.580
You're treating me like an outsider, too?

47:56.310 --> 47:57.110
Come here.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.770
Huh? Where?

47:58.770 --> 47:59.770
Come here.

48:00.860 --> 48:02.100
Come inside quick.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.220
Come on.

48:03.220 --> 48:04.750
Go, go. Quick.

48:05.020 --> 48:06.980
You do it well. Why drag your feet?

48:07.490 --> 48:08.670
I haven't done it before.

48:08.670 --> 48:09.340
Sit.

48:09.340 --> 48:10.580
Sit here.

48:10.610 --> 48:11.530
There you go.

48:13.660 --> 48:16.810
I haven't done it before, so I gave it a go.

48:16.820 --> 48:19.620
I should hear it to promote it to the CEO.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.710
It's been a long time since I've been here.

48:25.770 --> 48:26.770
Yeah.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.880
It's nothing, really.

48:30.150 --> 48:32.030
So we did tropical house

48:32.030 --> 48:33.610
and sugar pop, right?

48:33.720 --> 48:34.390
Yeah.

48:34.450 --> 48:35.490
But actually,

48:35.690 --> 48:37.960
Elle can do trap really well, too.

48:37.980 --> 48:38.980
Really?

48:39.090 --> 48:41.760
So if we carry the base in a weighty way

48:42.090 --> 48:44.430
and mix dubstep sounds in there,

48:44.760 --> 48:47.030
it'll be a totally different vibe.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.320
I don't know what you mean.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.560
Seriously.

48:52.310 --> 48:54.210
So just play the keyboard.

48:54.450 --> 48:56.920
You know we can't do all that here.

48:57.510 --> 48:58.510
Just play.

49:09.290 --> 49:10.410
Actually,

49:11.780 --> 49:12.820
this is our story.

49:13.980 --> 49:14.830
Huh?

49:25.730 --> 49:27.620
A long wait

49:28.630 --> 49:30.520
Seems endless

49:30.540 --> 49:32.540
Tomorrow is coming again

49:33.640 --> 49:35.230
Light and darkness

49:36.720 --> 49:38.540
Repeats itself again today

49:38.570 --> 49:40.570
In the returning night

49:41.720 --> 49:43.710
Today again, you and I

49:43.740 --> 49:46.730
When there is no star to look upon

49:47.810 --> 49:49.790
We are together

49:49.790 --> 49:51.610
Remember, you and I

49:51.630 --> 49:54.740
When this moment passes

49:54.750 --> 49:55.870
We'll rise

49:55.900 --> 49:59.390
Hope this will become a sweet memory

50:05.730 --> 50:07.780
Today again, you and I

50:07.780 --> 50:10.720
When there is no start to look upon

50:11.830 --> 50:13.850
We are together

50:13.850 --> 50:15.840
Remember, you and I

50:15.900 --> 50:18.810
When this moment passes

50:18.990 --> 50:20.000
We'll rise

50:20.000 --> 50:23.890
Hope this will become a sweet memory

50:26.060 --> 50:27.590
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.

50:28.610 --> 50:31.400
Hope this will become a sweet memory

50:34.670 --> 50:35.570
It's Du-ho.

50:36.440 --> 50:39.720
Hope this will become a sweet memory

50:44.940 --> 50:46.420
Wow!

50:46.510 --> 50:48.720
You still got it!

50:49.130 --> 50:50.060
This is the dignity

50:50.060 --> 50:52.490
of a regional preliminaries winner.

50:52.950 --> 50:54.630
Try out auditions again.

50:54.840 --> 50:56.630
That's horrendous.

50:56.990 --> 50:58.160
Don't say such a thing.

50:58.530 --> 50:59.320
Jenna.

50:59.700 --> 51:01.380
This song is amazing.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.400
You always say that.

51:03.440 --> 51:04.270
Seriously.

51:04.270 --> 51:07.610
If it's as you say, we'd be Blankpink already.

51:07.610 --> 51:08.960
How did you make it?

51:08.960 --> 51:10.060
- Huh?
- Du-ho!

51:11.920 --> 51:13.230
What are you doing here?

51:18.100 --> 51:19.100
Did you guys

51:19.870 --> 51:21.230
have rehearsal today?

51:21.570 --> 51:22.570
Oh!

51:23.370 --> 51:24.360
Cotton...

51:24.850 --> 51:25.850
Hello.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.800
Hello.

51:32.500 --> 51:33.500
Let's go.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.600
See you later.

51:38.330 --> 51:39.330
Jenna.

51:43.290 --> 51:44.610
Why are you staring?

51:44.610 --> 51:46.050
You made her uncomfortable.

51:46.750 --> 51:48.590
She must feel so intimidated already.

51:48.590 --> 51:49.590
Who is she?

51:49.620 --> 51:51.090
The leader of Cotton Candy.

51:51.090 --> 51:52.090
Kim Jenna.

51:52.690 --> 51:53.970
We saw each other a few times

51:53.970 --> 51:55.300
when we were trainees.

51:55.970 --> 51:57.080
You don't remember?

51:57.290 --> 51:59.070
Wow, you...

52:00.640 --> 52:02.000
You're really cold.

52:04.460 --> 52:05.740
What's she saying?

52:06.850 --> 52:08.290
Apartment complex?

52:10.570 --> 52:11.840
- Asst. Manager Park...
- Seriously.

52:11.840 --> 52:13.280
Should I kill him?

52:14.050 --> 52:15.700
He's asking us to kill him.

52:15.700 --> 52:16.820
What's the cause?

52:16.820 --> 52:18.860
Debt? Gambling? Drugs? An affair?

52:18.860 --> 52:20.800
What? Why does he have a death wish?

52:20.800 --> 52:21.410
Hyun-ji.

52:21.410 --> 52:22.910
I should've flipped out more

52:22.910 --> 52:24.590
when you did the radio gig.

52:24.590 --> 52:26.070
Seeing you go and do this again.

52:26.070 --> 52:27.190
Hyun-ji.

52:28.110 --> 52:29.790
Do you want to do it?

52:30.550 --> 52:31.750
What about you?

52:36.370 --> 52:37.370
See?

52:38.360 --> 52:40.230
We know what Elle would say.

52:40.470 --> 52:41.470
You?

52:41.700 --> 52:43.000
If you want to do it, then do it.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.170
I won't stop you.

52:45.380 --> 52:48.040
But there's a stage for us to sing together.

52:48.040 --> 52:49.320
That alone is...

52:51.840 --> 52:53.580
There are a lot of stages.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.310
There's a karaoke bar,

52:56.620 --> 52:57.870
the club where I work

52:57.870 --> 52:59.230
and hostess bars.

52:59.920 --> 53:01.390
Want me to get you one?

53:01.900 --> 53:03.180
Hey, Oh Hyun-ji!

53:08.610 --> 53:09.610
Oh Hyun-ji!

53:22.040 --> 53:22.980
Let go!

53:22.980 --> 53:24.020
Go apologize.

53:24.860 --> 53:26.300
No!

53:27.600 --> 53:29.280
Both of you are the same.

53:29.510 --> 53:32.410
A stage for us to sing together?

53:32.850 --> 53:34.170
Are you in a fairytale?

53:34.180 --> 53:36.470
Want me to get you Snow White costumes?

53:36.890 --> 53:38.450
She needs to get smacked in the back

53:38.450 --> 53:39.880
of the head to wake up.

53:39.880 --> 53:40.780
Watch what you say.

53:40.780 --> 53:41.680
No!

53:41.680 --> 53:44.390
If I do that, my head will explode!

53:44.430 --> 53:45.130
Hyun-ji.

53:45.130 --> 53:47.750
Don't act nice on top of being incompetent.

53:48.050 --> 53:50.560
You both are so annoying!

53:52.720 --> 53:53.720
Hey!

53:54.580 --> 53:56.100
What are you doing?

53:58.710 --> 54:00.390
I stopped myself from hitting you.

54:03.560 --> 54:04.190
What?

54:04.250 --> 54:05.450
Lash out at me.

54:06.160 --> 54:09.170
If you want to believe we failed because of me,

54:10.040 --> 54:11.080
then do that.

54:11.360 --> 54:13.430
If you feel at ease by cursing,

54:15.020 --> 54:15.960
then do that.

54:18.330 --> 54:20.200
But don't do that to Stella.

54:22.060 --> 54:23.580
You shouldn't act like that to her.

54:23.710 --> 54:24.710
Why?

54:26.540 --> 54:27.820
Why shouldn't I?

54:29.060 --> 54:30.260
I will!

54:31.160 --> 54:33.100
I'll act like that to Stella!

54:33.350 --> 54:34.980
I'll act like that to Elle!

54:35.020 --> 54:36.980
I'll act like that to Chae-ah!

54:37.890 --> 54:39.910
I'll act like that to CEO Ma!

54:40.050 --> 54:42.630
I'll act like that to Mr. Chubby Du-ho!

54:43.370 --> 54:45.470
I'll act like that to the utility pole!

54:45.610 --> 54:47.680
I'll act like that to the rock!

54:47.890 --> 54:50.850
I'll act like that to anyone on the street!

54:59.780 --> 55:00.900
What was that?

55:10.030 --> 55:11.030
Stella.

55:12.070 --> 55:14.530
Hyun-ji probably doesn't mean it.

55:16.980 --> 55:17.980
I know.

55:19.570 --> 55:21.520
She blows off steam

55:22.230 --> 55:23.650
and later apologizes.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.740
What do you really think

55:31.100 --> 55:32.780
about what Jenna said?

55:40.310 --> 55:42.710
I'm going to do whatever Jenna says.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.120
Right.

55:49.980 --> 55:52.110
I'm torn once again.

55:53.980 --> 55:55.720
It's a gig in a long time,

55:55.900 --> 55:57.840
so half of me wants to do it.

55:59.950 --> 56:02.750
The other half wonders if I have to do it.

56:06.800 --> 56:07.730
Hey.

56:08.100 --> 56:08.910
Hey.

56:12.830 --> 56:14.130
This month's living expense.

56:20.880 --> 56:22.240
I'm not doing it.

56:23.410 --> 56:25.030
You must already know this.

56:33.850 --> 56:34.850
Mine, too.

56:35.160 --> 56:37.560
Forget it. You don't even live here.

56:38.660 --> 56:39.940
I'm leaving now.

56:45.090 --> 56:46.090
Jenna.

56:47.800 --> 56:50.270
I have to ask my mom.

56:51.360 --> 56:52.070
Okay.

56:52.550 --> 56:53.760
Let me know later.

56:54.840 --> 56:55.960
I'll call you.

57:02.900 --> 57:03.900
Jenna.

57:04.120 --> 57:05.240
Isn't it hard?

57:05.340 --> 57:07.060
Trying to hold the five of you together.

57:07.060 --> 57:07.870
Isn't it hard?

57:08.080 --> 57:10.540
Even we can't handle Hyun-ji.

57:13.750 --> 57:16.680
Flying off the handle fueled her dance moves.

57:19.980 --> 57:21.810
Ae-rin got a call.

57:22.560 --> 57:24.560
Tonight's dancing is the best.

57:48.240 --> 57:49.420
What the heck?

57:58.910 --> 58:00.240
Seriously!

58:03.430 --> 58:04.620
Lunatic.

58:15.920 --> 58:17.140
Let's hang out.

58:17.870 --> 58:19.150
You want to die?

58:19.540 --> 58:20.260
What the?

58:20.260 --> 58:21.350
Seriously.

58:21.630 --> 58:22.630
What?

58:23.540 --> 58:26.070
I'll make you pay. I had a bad day anyway.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.800
Let go! Let go!

58:28.220 --> 58:30.540
Do you want to die?

58:31.030 --> 58:34.500
I heard about our team breaking up again.

58:35.230 --> 58:36.500
That's nothing new.

58:37.510 --> 58:38.870
Don't worry about it.

58:41.990 --> 58:43.270
As you know,

58:44.900 --> 58:46.100
if we break up,

58:47.530 --> 58:49.210
I have nowhere to go.

58:52.180 --> 58:53.860
Being in Cotton Candy

58:55.530 --> 58:57.130
is everything to me.

59:05.770 --> 59:06.770
But Jenna,

59:07.700 --> 59:10.600
if you're straining to lead us because of me,

59:11.440 --> 59:12.530
don't do it.

59:14.340 --> 59:15.600
You don't have to.

59:17.980 --> 59:19.530
You're not the only one

59:21.400 --> 59:23.220
that doesn't want to break up.

59:23.990 --> 59:25.650
The others don't want to, either.

59:25.710 --> 59:27.230
But the others...

59:28.690 --> 59:29.800
Do you remember?

59:30.520 --> 59:33.320
The last time, when everyone was suffering

59:33.730 --> 59:35.930
and the agency was pressuring us,

59:36.150 --> 59:38.250
we decided to have a vote on breaking up.

59:38.250 --> 59:39.120
But

59:39.470 --> 59:41.150
they all said they were busy,

59:41.340 --> 59:42.970
so it didn't happen because no one made it.

59:43.130 --> 59:44.130
That night,

59:46.830 --> 59:48.340
they all came.

59:50.140 --> 59:50.870
Huh?

59:52.030 --> 59:52.850
You go in first.

59:52.850 --> 59:54.540
Why? You go in. You're older.

59:54.540 --> 59:55.990
No. I'm scared.

59:55.990 --> 59:58.200
You're older. You go in first.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.910
Only at times like this do you think of age.

59:59.910 --> 1:00:01.600
I don't want to.

1:00:01.910 --> 1:00:03.250
I'm leaving.

1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:06.100
I can't go inside.

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:08.640
Hey, come on.

1:00:21.290 --> 1:00:22.390
Where are you?

1:00:23.140 --> 1:00:25.130
Something came up, so I'll be late.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:27.090
What about the others?

1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:29.150
Oh.

1:00:30.170 --> 1:00:31.340
Only Stella is here.

1:00:32.070 --> 1:00:33.070
Okay.

1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:35.620
Then let's vote tomorrow.

1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:39.210
I don't know when I'll get home.

1:00:47.550 --> 1:00:48.550
Even Elle?

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:55.560
Even though she acts like that,

1:00:57.660 --> 1:00:59.710
in her heart, she's holding on to us.

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:04.200
No one is sure about breaking up.

1:01:14.660 --> 1:01:16.020
That doesn't mean

1:01:18.590 --> 1:01:20.630
you have to carry everything.

1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:29.040
To be honest, I waver, too.

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:33.450
Whenever Hyun-ji is like that,

1:01:34.090 --> 1:01:35.450
I get mad at her.

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.440
I get mad at Elle.

1:01:42.820 --> 1:01:45.550
I think, 'I can survive if it's just me.'

1:01:46.580 --> 1:01:48.380
'It'll be better than now.'

1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:50.500
I think those thoughts.

1:01:54.850 --> 1:01:56.530
I waver every moment.

1:01:57.890 --> 1:01:58.760
But

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:01.670
why are you trying to carry us all?

1:02:06.150 --> 1:02:07.190
I don't know.

1:02:09.130 --> 1:02:10.400
It just feels like

1:02:13.070 --> 1:02:16.490
I haven't finished what I have to do.

1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:20.460
What more do you have to do?

1:02:23.910 --> 1:02:25.820
It might be lingering attachment.

1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:37.980
Hello?

1:02:37.980 --> 1:02:38.980
Jenna!

1:02:39.170 --> 1:02:40.830
What's wrong with her?

1:02:41.180 --> 1:02:42.480
- He started it!
- Go! Go!

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:43.480
Let go!

1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:45.720
Seriously.

1:02:45.980 --> 1:02:46.650
Hey!

1:02:46.650 --> 1:02:47.990
Just go!

1:02:47.990 --> 1:02:49.890
Hyun-ji! Are you okay?

1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:51.920
Look.

1:02:53.030 --> 1:02:55.590
How dare you throw a fit?

1:02:56.230 --> 1:02:57.800
I heard you're an idol singer.

1:02:58.530 --> 1:02:59.900
Let's see.

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:01.930
Oh!

1:03:02.300 --> 1:03:03.600
Who are you?

1:03:04.470 --> 1:03:05.800
I've never seen you before.

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:07.240
Stop it.

1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:09.010
Hold still.

1:03:09.340 --> 1:03:10.680
I know all the names

1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:14.450
of the idol group members, even the B-listers.

1:03:14.950 --> 1:03:17.620
But I've never seen you.

1:03:17.620 --> 1:03:19.050
You jerk!

1:03:19.650 --> 1:03:20.650
Hey!

1:03:24.590 --> 1:03:25.820
Are you crazy?

1:03:25.820 --> 1:03:27.060
Wait!

1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:30.830
Wait. Wait.

1:03:30.830 --> 1:03:31.630
What the?

1:03:31.630 --> 1:03:33.700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:03:34.370 --> 1:03:35.810
Please just leave.

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.400
I beg you.

1:03:38.170 --> 1:03:40.170
See that? Leave?

1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:41.640
Just leave?

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:43.310
I'll give you compensation.

1:03:43.710 --> 1:03:45.140
Please let this go.

1:03:45.140 --> 1:03:46.850
This is so annoying.

1:03:46.850 --> 1:03:48.380
Get lost, Jenna!

1:03:48.380 --> 1:03:50.080
Hyun-ji, hush.

1:03:51.650 --> 1:03:52.720
Seriously.

1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:53.720
Huh?

1:03:54.290 --> 1:03:56.050
I think I know her.

1:03:56.890 --> 1:03:58.960
Aren't you on the show "Real Incidents"?

1:03:59.220 --> 1:04:02.460
Wow, I'm a huge fan of that show.

1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:04.260
Wait.

1:04:10.270 --> 1:04:12.340
I think they really are an idol group.

1:04:13.070 --> 1:04:15.110
They kind of look like it.

1:04:17.780 --> 1:04:20.210
I think I saw you somewhere else, too.

1:04:25.250 --> 1:04:27.050
Let me take a photo with an idol singer.

1:04:27.050 --> 1:04:28.850
Stop that!

1:04:29.150 --> 1:04:30.290
Hey, hey, hey.

1:04:30.290 --> 1:04:33.590
I have 100,000 followers on Instagram.

1:04:33.860 --> 1:04:36.030
I'm an influencer, you know?

1:04:36.430 --> 1:04:38.300
It's free marketing.

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:39.600
You don't want it?

1:04:40.700 --> 1:04:43.470
Let's take one photo.

1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:45.440
Stop!

1:04:46.370 --> 1:04:47.650
You crazy witch.

1:04:51.740 --> 1:04:52.980
What the?

1:05:03.860 --> 1:05:05.380
What is he doing?

1:05:05.860 --> 1:05:07.360
He must be crazy!

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:08.290
Hyun-ji!

1:05:08.290 --> 1:05:09.460
Let go!

1:05:09.460 --> 1:05:10.960
Why give him money?

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:12.810
It's more trouble if we go to the police.

1:05:12.810 --> 1:05:13.810
Stay still!

1:05:13.830 --> 1:05:15.270
Let go!

1:05:15.270 --> 1:05:16.340
Stop it!

1:05:16.340 --> 1:05:18.540
You low-life punks!

1:05:18.540 --> 1:05:20.940
Do you know what kind of money that is?

1:05:20.940 --> 1:05:22.240
Let go!

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.440
Hey, hey!

1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:26.280
Did you see me throw that punch?

1:05:26.580 --> 1:05:28.750
In my prime, in my hometown...

1:05:28.750 --> 1:05:29.950
How much did you give him?

1:05:31.420 --> 1:05:32.220
Huh?

1:05:32.620 --> 1:05:34.550
How much?

1:05:35.650 --> 1:05:37.760
Why did you give it to him, you fool?

1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:52.270
So annoying.

1:06:06.650 --> 1:06:08.490
Tell Hyun-ji to hang in there just a little more.

1:06:09.420 --> 1:06:11.090
I'll get you a gig.

1:06:13.630 --> 1:06:15.630
Drive safely.

1:06:15.790 --> 1:06:17.260
- I'll be going now.
- Okay.

1:06:17.260 --> 1:06:18.660
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:28.810
If Hyun-ji and Elle keep refusing,

1:06:29.110 --> 1:06:32.310
the three of us can do it ourselves.

1:06:33.110 --> 1:06:34.470
We can, can't we?

1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:37.750
I'll try to persuade them one more time.

1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:43.050
How can the two of them do it?

1:06:43.050 --> 1:06:44.920
Are you going to betray me?

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:46.830
Whether they sink or swim, leave them alone.

1:06:46.830 --> 1:06:48.690
They have to do it to feel it.

1:06:48.690 --> 1:06:50.460
What more can they feel now?

1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:53.260
The real reason I'm angry!

1:06:53.260 --> 1:06:55.270
Why are you yelling?

1:06:55.730 --> 1:06:57.600
You have anger management issues.

1:06:57.600 --> 1:06:58.840
Anyway,

1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:01.170
draw the line like I did.

1:07:01.170 --> 1:07:02.370
I'm hanging up.

1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:14.750
You didn't come for me last night, did you?

1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:17.560
Don't pick a fight with me.

1:07:19.390 --> 1:07:22.230
How much do you get paid doing the vocal lessons?

1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:24.530
As much as me working at the club?

1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:29.130
Are you bored?

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:35.070
You're looking for another agency, right?

1:07:35.510 --> 1:07:37.180
Ae-rin saw you.

1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:39.340
It's not surprising though.

1:07:40.350 --> 1:07:42.210
You should find something, too.

1:07:43.650 --> 1:07:45.650
No one will take responsibility over your life.

1:07:54.060 --> 1:07:55.420
Did you find out?

1:08:00.230 --> 1:08:01.230
Elle.

1:08:02.570 --> 1:08:04.600
If it's about Asst. Manager Park's gig,

1:08:04.700 --> 1:08:06.140
I said I wasn't doing it.

1:08:11.710 --> 1:08:12.380
Don't ask.

1:08:12.380 --> 1:08:14.750
I'm too busy to go to that.

1:08:31.859 --> 1:08:33.500
Hello, Asst. Manager Park.

1:08:33.630 --> 1:08:36.840
You know about that gig?

1:08:37.340 --> 1:08:41.970
I think just Stella, Chae-ah and I will be going.

1:08:46.210 --> 1:08:47.450
Hey, Jenna.

1:08:48.550 --> 1:08:50.979
I can't go to practice today.

1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:53.819
My mom scheduled something.

1:08:53.819 --> 1:08:56.420
Then I'll text you the changed position.

1:08:56.420 --> 1:08:57.859
Come early tomorrow.

1:08:57.859 --> 1:09:00.490
Okay, but

1:09:02.060 --> 1:09:04.729
I haven't told my mom yet.

1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:06.899
Seriously!

1:09:07.970 --> 1:09:09.200
You wacko.

1:09:11.270 --> 1:09:12.069
Du-ho.

1:09:12.069 --> 1:09:13.069
Yes?

1:09:13.399 --> 1:09:14.410
Say that again.

1:09:14.410 --> 1:09:15.510
What did you say?

1:09:15.609 --> 1:09:17.510
The Youth Festival.

1:09:17.510 --> 1:09:18.979
Why not give that to Cotton Candy?

1:09:19.279 --> 1:09:22.080
Highteen's schedule overlaps so they can't go.

1:09:23.750 --> 1:09:24.580
Du-ho.

1:09:24.580 --> 1:09:25.479
Yes?

1:09:25.580 --> 1:09:26.819
Let's say you're the host.

1:09:26.819 --> 1:09:27.490
Yes.

1:09:27.490 --> 1:09:29.319
Then will you accept that?

1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:30.859
Will you?

1:09:32.090 --> 1:09:33.729
Why is it so loud?

1:09:39.660 --> 1:09:41.930
I heard there's a problem with Highteen's goods.

1:09:42.569 --> 1:09:44.069
Handle it well.

1:09:44.069 --> 1:09:45.540
Don't fight with the fans and

1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:47.250
get boycotted like last time.

1:09:47.270 --> 1:09:48.270
Yes, Sir.

1:09:48.939 --> 1:09:50.170
Sir.

1:09:51.140 --> 1:09:53.779
Have you listened to the song Jenna sent?

1:09:56.350 --> 1:09:57.710
It's really good.

1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:01.020
Please give it a listen, even if you're busy.

1:10:04.860 --> 1:10:05.890
Okay.

1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:08.190
Thank you.

1:10:08.930 --> 1:10:13.230
Residents Social Event

1:10:13.260 --> 1:10:15.070
Teuroteu is the trend now.

1:10:15.070 --> 1:10:16.460
Maybe she's a teuroteu singer.

1:10:27.550 --> 1:10:28.210
Where are you?

1:10:28.210 --> 1:10:31.080
Your acting is bad, but you have so many requests!

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.820
The filming keeps getting delayed.

1:10:33.820 --> 1:10:36.020
I asked to change the order.

1:10:36.390 --> 1:10:37.890
But it's so brutal right now.

1:10:37.890 --> 1:10:39.320
Call someone else and shoot.

1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:40.630
I can't do this.

1:10:40.630 --> 1:10:42.690
What if I can't go?

1:10:42.690 --> 1:10:44.200
Stella, the director is coming.

1:10:45.330 --> 1:10:46.400
Stella!

1:10:48.530 --> 1:10:49.800
What's wrong with everyone today?

1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:51.370
Did you all plot this without me?

1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:54.840
If you're going to be like this, go home forever.

1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:56.870
Director, that's not it...

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:07.120
Hey, Jenna.

1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:08.440
Chae-ah, where are you?

1:11:08.530 --> 1:11:11.630
Uh, I haven't told my mom yet.

1:11:13.290 --> 1:11:15.170
But she's not picking up.

1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:29.120
Good.

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:31.960
Who are you looking for?

1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:34.540
What trouble are you going to cause?

1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:36.410
You'll get hurt if you know more.

1:11:36.410 --> 1:11:37.550
Just drive.

1:11:39.510 --> 1:11:40.630
Let's stop by one more place.

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:43.200
Jenna is waiting.

1:11:43.710 --> 1:11:44.710
Chae-ah.

1:11:45.570 --> 1:11:48.070
You didn't ask your mom on purpose, right?

1:11:48.070 --> 1:11:50.140
You don't want to do it either, right?

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.280
That's not it!

1:11:52.350 --> 1:11:54.270
Be honest.

1:11:54.690 --> 1:11:56.500
Jenna has Stella.

1:11:57.140 --> 1:11:59.280
Save your energy. It's needed elsewhere.

1:12:00.810 --> 1:12:02.200
Important situation? What?

1:12:04.530 --> 1:12:06.930
They're being unreasonable.

1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:12.120
They're making a laughing stock out of me.

1:12:12.390 --> 1:12:14.550
I should've talked more with them.

1:12:15.940 --> 1:12:17.350
I'll make up for it all.

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:18.600
Jenna.

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:21.530
I shouldn't be saying this now,

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:23.480
but your team won't do.

1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:26.130
Don't make such an effort on your own.

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:28.920
Leading them by the collar can only go so far.

1:12:29.810 --> 1:12:31.960
You've waited long.

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:36.530
We have a guest appearance at our event.

1:12:36.890 --> 1:12:37.890
Here she is.

1:12:39.650 --> 1:12:42.120
Cotton Candy's Jenna!

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.290
Give her a round of applause.

1:12:45.340 --> 1:12:46.870
Applause, please!

1:12:47.010 --> 1:12:48.510
Two, three. Hoo!

1:12:48.740 --> 1:12:50.940
Hello, I'm Jenna of Cotton Candy.

1:12:50.940 --> 1:12:52.300
Nice to meet you.

1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:54.610
Okay.

1:12:54.630 --> 1:12:56.090
First,

1:12:56.090 --> 1:12:57.410
I want to apologize...

1:12:57.410 --> 1:12:58.410
Wait.

1:12:58.590 --> 1:13:00.720
I heard a girl group was coming.

1:13:00.860 --> 1:13:02.650
What happened?

1:13:03.250 --> 1:13:05.320
My kids were so excited. Now what?

1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:06.650
It's just one person.

1:13:06.770 --> 1:13:09.270
Why'd you tell us to come out in the hot sun?

1:13:09.300 --> 1:13:10.180
Jeez.

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:13.330
Why go overboard and call a singer?

1:13:13.370 --> 1:13:15.350
Our representative is excessive

1:13:15.350 --> 1:13:17.610
with everything he does.

1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:20.280
Hey, #1204.

1:13:20.550 --> 1:13:21.960
How can you say that?

1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:23.530
Look here.

1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:25.190
I understand you worked hard,

1:13:25.190 --> 1:13:27.480
but you should've called a teuroteu singer.

1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:30.940
Then the vibe would be great alone.

1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:32.660
Wait, wait!

1:13:33.070 --> 1:13:34.990
Sir.

1:13:35.390 --> 1:13:37.560
Do you know how much it costs to call

1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:39.500
one teuroteu singer?

1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:42.280
Excuse me, everyone. I want to apologize.

1:13:42.510 --> 1:13:43.760
It's all my fault.

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:45.720
I made the request at such short notice.

1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:47.520
It was hard to change the members' schedule.

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:49.320
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

1:13:49.340 --> 1:13:50.640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:52.080
They're not even famous.

1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:53.520
Why would they be busy?

1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:54.580
Are you kidding me?

1:13:54.580 --> 1:13:56.330
This is no fun.

1:13:56.330 --> 1:13:58.110
I want to leave, Mom.

1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:01.740
We came because my girls' dream is an idol singer.

1:14:02.420 --> 1:14:04.760
They even missed dance lessons for this.

1:14:05.150 --> 1:14:06.030
Let's go.

1:14:06.070 --> 1:14:07.110
We're leaving, too.

1:14:07.130 --> 1:14:07.720
Come on.

1:14:07.750 --> 1:14:09.200
- Let's go.
- Jeez.

1:14:09.230 --> 1:14:10.350
Wait. Hold on.

1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:11.890
- Hold on a second.
- Wait!

1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:13.390
Just wait for a bit.

1:14:13.410 --> 1:14:14.340
Wait, please.

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:16.240
What?

1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:18.680
If it's okay with you,

1:14:18.830 --> 1:14:21.080
can I perform with your kids?

1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:24.290
Want to be a temporary member?

1:14:24.990 --> 1:14:27.180
They don't know your songs.

1:14:29.110 --> 1:14:31.070
You know Highteen's songs, right?

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:33.450
Jenna.

1:14:35.830 --> 1:14:36.430
Let's go.

1:14:36.430 --> 1:14:37.580
Hey.

1:14:37.580 --> 1:14:40.040
Highteen from the start? That's brutal.

1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:42.720
Singing our own songs is even more pathetic.

1:14:43.310 --> 1:14:45.440
This song is good. How annoying.

1:14:48.470 --> 1:14:49.660
You're funny dawg

1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:53.160
Feelin feelin fun feelin feelin fee feelin

Hey you miss that point

1:15:00.180 --> 1:15:01.860
What are you looking at?

1:15:02.490 --> 1:15:04.650
Stop pretending you know me

1:15:04.690 --> 1:15:06.370
I'm sick of your calling

1:15:06.940 --> 1:15:09.470
Because of me got freeze you losin your face

1:15:09.470 --> 1:15:10.880
Funny like that

1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:13.270
You covet everything that's mine (like that)

1:15:13.270 --> 1:15:15.000
I'm sorry, you can't be me

1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:17.050
Your dream is fun to me

1:15:17.050 --> 1:15:19.970
You're so stupid like dumb and fool

1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:22.840
You keep gazing at me

1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:24.810
I already know

1:15:25.190 --> 1:15:27.840
You're jealous of everything that's mine

1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:29.030
Foolish dumb

1:15:29.030 --> 1:15:31.000
Every day, I shine

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.370
I'm shinin but you can't be

1:15:33.460 --> 1:15:35.480
Even though you envy me

1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:38.350
You can't be me

1:15:38.510 --> 1:15:40.320
You wanna be me

1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:42.470
But you can't

1:15:42.470 --> 1:15:44.940
Keep being jealous

1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:46.700
Hahahaha

Give them a round of applause.

1:16:09.380 --> 1:16:10.380
Good job.

1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:13.480
Good job, guys. Good job.

1:16:15.510 --> 1:16:17.820
Thank you. Thank you.

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:19.520
Next song. Next song.

1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:23.280
Okay! Thank you.

1:16:23.860 --> 1:16:24.890
The next song

1:16:24.890 --> 1:16:28.030
will be "White Day" by Cotton Candy.

1:16:28.030 --> 1:16:29.030
Wait.

1:16:29.300 --> 1:16:31.890
Do you know "Battery of Love"?

1:16:32.820 --> 1:16:33.580
What?

1:16:33.930 --> 1:16:35.290
- "Battery..."
- Oh, but, Sir...

1:16:35.290 --> 1:16:36.780
Yeah! "Battery of Love"!

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:38.190
"Battery of Love"!

1:16:42.820 --> 1:16:47.540
- "Battery"!
- "Battery"!

1:16:51.420 --> 1:16:52.410
Yes!

1:16:52.410 --> 1:16:53.530
I can sing it.

1:16:53.810 --> 1:16:55.250
"Battery of Love"!

1:16:55.890 --> 1:16:57.120
Cue the music!

1:16:56.840 --> 1:16:59.040
"Battery of Love"

1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:15.980
Fill me with your love

1:17:15.980 --> 1:17:19.810
My battery of love has run out

1:17:19.810 --> 1:17:24.180
I can't live without you
I really can't live without you

1:17:24.180 --> 1:17:26.940
You are my battery

1:17:26.940 --> 1:17:34.380
Don't say I'm a cruel woman

1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:40.680
I'm choosing to break up for you

1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:44.410
Don't forget my love

1:17:44.410 --> 1:17:47.840
You are in me

1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:51.510
- It's okay if you're not handsome
- It's okay!

1:17:51.510 --> 1:17:55.180
- It's okay if you're not buff
- It's okay!

1:17:55.180 --> 1:18:01.710
Since you only care for me
You are my number one

1:18:02.220 --> 1:18:04.220
No, I can't go now.

1:18:04.580 --> 1:18:06.420
Jenna's alone. What can we do?

1:18:07.390 --> 1:18:12.360
I'm going to faint, I'm going to faint

1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:16.120
I'm going to faint

1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:25.220
You came into my life suddenly
Now you want to leave me

1:18:25.220 --> 1:18:35.290
Drowning my sorrows in a drink
I sing about my forgotten dream

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:42.990
I scream
that I am still alive

1:18:42.990 --> 1:18:49.920
I scream
that I still have a dream

1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:57.690
Even if this world tries to bring me down

1:18:57.690 --> 1:19:07.260
Sometimes I scream like this
to show I'm still alive

1:19:11.460 --> 1:19:15.290
If it doesn't work even when I try,

1:19:15.290 --> 1:19:18.660
I'll keep drawing near you again

1:19:18.660 --> 1:19:21.960
Like it's the last thing I'll do

1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:29.560
There's nothing I can't do in this world

1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:33.260
Strike with a gold ax
Strike with a silver ax

1:19:33.260 --> 1:19:36.990
There's no giving up in my book

1:19:39.320 --> 1:19:41.360
I'll strike until it works

1:19:41.210 --> 1:19:44.030
Cotton Candy MR

1:19:49.570 --> 1:19:52.550
Kim Jenna
Hello, Sir. It's me, Jenna.

1:19:51.870 --> 1:19:53.360
Hello, Sir.

1:19:53.620 --> 1:19:54.820
It's me, Jenna.

1:20:00.930 --> 1:20:02.950
Jenna from Cotton Candy is singing,

1:20:02.950 --> 1:20:04.630
"The Labyrinth of Love."

1:20:05.180 --> 1:20:07.850
Turn your flashlights on and wave them in the air.

1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:09.450
Come on.

1:20:22.170 --> 1:20:34.840
Even though I make a resolve
I don't know what to do about love

1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:46.110
A heart that is blinded with love
cries because of one truth

1:20:46.190 --> 1:20:47.770
Let's all sing together.

1:20:47.790 --> 1:20:54.120
Love that was planted in your small heart

1:20:54.120 --> 1:21:00.620
Don't hurt me, forever

1:20:57.380 --> 1:20:59.000
Delete

1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.200
Notification
Will you delete this email?

1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:10.790
With no beginning or end
The distant labyrinth of love

1:21:04.060 --> 1:21:05.180
Yes

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:13.200
This is Jenna from Cotton Candy!

1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:23.280
Cotton Candy! Cotton Candy!

1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:24.640
Thank you!

1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:34.050
You did a great job today.

1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.320
I'm sorry.

1:21:37.350 --> 1:21:38.300
Go on inside.

1:21:38.300 --> 1:21:39.730
Okay. See you at the office.

1:21:39.730 --> 1:21:40.780
Huh? Okay.

1:21:40.820 --> 1:21:42.340
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1:21:42.470 --> 1:21:43.470
Bye.

1:23:15.730 --> 1:23:16.730
Yes, Sir?

1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:19.580
CEO's Office

1:23:23.490 --> 1:23:24.490
Come in.

1:23:28.860 --> 1:23:29.860
Hello, Sir.

1:23:31.620 --> 1:23:32.270
Hi.

1:23:33.050 --> 1:23:33.870
Welcome.

1:23:34.460 --> 1:23:35.460
Have a seat.

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.260
Okay.

1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:48.840
It's been long since I've seen all of you.

1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:50.890
I still hear about how you are all doing.

1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:53.180
Everyone's doing well.

1:23:53.980 --> 1:23:55.780
I had a gig today...

1:23:56.050 --> 1:23:57.050
Jenna.

1:23:58.020 --> 1:23:58.750
Yes?

1:24:05.510 --> 1:24:08.250
Sometimes, I think about when we started.

1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:12.320
When I first discovered you,

1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:16.430
it felt like I had the whole world.

1:24:19.110 --> 1:24:21.170
When I gathered each and every one of you.

1:24:21.290 --> 1:24:22.650
When you debuted.

1:24:24.620 --> 1:24:27.820
When that foolish Du-ho came to me to be an agent.

1:24:34.530 --> 1:24:36.800
Looking back, I was happiest then.

1:24:39.970 --> 1:24:42.300
Minus the fact I didn't have money.

1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:49.400
You complained you were knee-deep in loans.

1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:52.140
That's right.

1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:53.890
There were five of us,

1:24:54.130 --> 1:24:56.660
but you bought four portions of snacks

1:24:57.430 --> 1:25:00.100
and insisted you thought there were four of us.

1:25:14.210 --> 1:25:17.950
Now, banks are begging me to take out a loan

1:25:19.970 --> 1:25:22.370
and I can buy 50 portions of snacks.

1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:28.960
I'm so glad the company

1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:30.820
is thriving.

1:25:31.780 --> 1:25:32.780
Jenna.

1:25:33.450 --> 1:25:34.450
Yes?

1:25:35.550 --> 1:25:38.690
When the contract is over, I won't renew it.

1:25:39.460 --> 1:25:41.030
Cotton Candy will break up.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:47.720
Sir.

1:25:50.380 --> 1:25:52.700
We won't ask for anything.

1:25:53.200 --> 1:25:54.200
Can you just

1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:57.020
wait two more years?

1:25:57.540 --> 1:25:58.270
Then we'll...

1:25:58.270 --> 1:25:59.970
I'm only going to save you, Jenna.

1:26:08.810 --> 1:26:11.080
Only you will stay with Starpeace.

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:21.830
We thank Jang Seong-gyu, Narsha, BIG Naughty
and Raiden for their special appearance

1:26:40.950 --> 1:26:43.150
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:26:43.140 --> 1:26:43.880
So you're saying

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:45.300
we're the reason we're disbanding?

1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:46.860
I don't know the entertainment business,

1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:49.970
but I know you can't succeed with skills alone.

1:26:49.970 --> 1:26:51.750
You didn't know we'll have a co-president, right?

1:26:51.750 --> 1:26:53.990
When CEO Cha comes, Cotton Candy will be cut.

1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:55.940
Why did we fail,

1:26:55.940 --> 1:26:58.190
ending up sponging off of that fool?

1:26:58.220 --> 1:26:59.510
If you leave like this,

1:26:59.510 --> 1:27:00.770
I might really let go of you.

1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:02.310
You're always like this.

1:27:02.310 --> 1:27:04.440
You look down on me, use me and desert me!

1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:05.990
Is this fun to you?

1:27:06.020 --> 1:27:08.580
Don't try to use me to feel less guilty.

1:27:08.610 --> 1:27:10.350
Was this what you wanted to hear?

1:27:10.350 --> 1:27:12.380
Were you waiting for me to say that?

1:27:12.450 --> 1:27:14.650
I think it's time we made a decision.
