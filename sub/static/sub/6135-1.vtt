00:45.546 --> 00:48.131
Dahlia, let's go inside now.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.718
She'll come soon,
but let's go inside now.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.681
What are we gonna do,
Dahlia?

00:55.806 --> 00:59.685
What are we gonna do
about your mother always being so late?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.510
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.557
Did you ring?

01:38.682 --> 01:40.809
It's not 11.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.103
You didn't ring.

01:51.195 --> 01:55.365
Good. You're early.
You can come right in.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.700
- You've been subletting?
- Right.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.120
When my construction company moved
to New York, the rents were outta sight,

02:00.204 --> 02:02.372
so we only took
a one-year lease.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.624
And when my wife
asked me to leave,

02:03.707 --> 02:06.376
I got a small one-bedroom
in Jersey City that's cheap.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.836
- How much?
- 800.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.506
Where will Cecilia sleep then?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.425
There's a pullout couch in the living room,
so when she comes to stay with me,

02:13.550 --> 02:17.012
I'll sleep there.
I can't afford two bedrooms.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.681
How 'bout you, Dahlia? We need to know
what your situation is gonna be.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.726
Any luck in finding a suitable place
for you and Cecilia?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.812
- I'm looking at apartments today.
- Where?

02:25.896 --> 02:28.524
- Where?
- I told you, I'm moving to Jersey City.

02:28.607 --> 02:32.069
There's a school there, it's great. And
there's plenty of cheap places to rent, so...

02:32.152 --> 02:35.864
You got an apartment near me, it would
make the shared custody easier.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.366
Why do you want her, Kyle?

02:37.491 --> 02:40.327
- What do you mean, "Why do I want her?"
- You were never interested in her before.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.955
- What?
- You know, he forgot her fifth birthday.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.748
- No. No, I didn't.
- No?

02:44.873 --> 02:48.794
No, I didn't. The plane was stuck
on the tarmac, and we didn't have a gate.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.964
I told you a million times,
the phones didn't work.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.633
No one believes you, cos everyone
knows what you were doing.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.844
- "Everyone"? No, you. Only you.
- OK.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.555
You see? She's crazy.
You live in a world of your own.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.598
I make one mistake,
and I don't care about Ceci?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.767
- You don't like playing with her.
- You're insane. You're insane.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.031
Be honest with yourself. You can't raise
Ceci alone. You can't handle it.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.076
Just be honest with yourself.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.081
Isn't it funny
how small the cars look?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.709
- Yeah.
- If you look at them from up here.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.504
Fit them between your fingers,
if you squint.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.380
Yeah.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.094
Oh, look.
There's a tram.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.767
And that's where we're going,
Roosevelt Island.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.859
Mommy, that's not the city.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.070
Sure it is.
Just a different part of the city.

04:38.195 --> 04:42.282
No, that's the city over there.
That's not the city.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.993
- She's right.
- Mm-hm.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.503
Here we are.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.588
It is chilly, though, isn't it?
Are you cold?

04:56.713 --> 04:57.840
Yeah, a little bit.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.385
Yeah? Hey, look,
that's where you'd go to school.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.929
I don't want
to go to school here.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.389
Why not?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.766
It's too small.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.310
Oh, I see.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.562
Mm-hm.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.273
- You know, I got your snack for ya.
- You do?

05:14.398 --> 05:16.358
Yeah. Are you hungry now?
Do you want it now?

05:16.483 --> 05:18.986
- Maybe I'll wait.
- OK.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.865
Let's just check.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.741
Let's see.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.076
540...

05:26.159 --> 05:28.537
Just...

05:29.037 --> 05:30.414
40...

05:30.539 --> 05:32.875
That way.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.585
OK.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.963
It's nice here.
It's like a small town.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.174
I like the big city better.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.135
Why didn't we rent that last place?
That was really nice.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.930
It was. It was too expensive for us, honey.
We need something that's a better price.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.766
But I don't want
to live here, Mommy.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.519
Why not, Ceci?

05:52.603 --> 05:55.856
It's all the same.
And it's small. Too small.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.150
"It's too small"?
I think you're too small.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.110
- No, I'm not. I'm big.
- Small.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.778
- I'm big.
- OK, good.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.906
Then are you gonna be a big girl,
and give this one a chance?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.782
Yeah? Cos otherwise
you know what happens?

06:05.866 --> 06:06.241
What?

06:06.366 --> 06:12.080
My itsy-bitsy muffin. I cover you all up
with jam like this, and then...

06:12.206 --> 06:14.291
And then eat you up.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.047
OK. That's us.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.175
We are a little bit early.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.136
We need...
Oh, golly. Five...

06:26.553 --> 06:28.514
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.808
- Are you Mrs. Bernstein?
- No, I'm Ms Williams.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.687
Ah, Ms Williams. Oh, you're early.
Mr. Murray. We spoke on the phone.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.482
Listen, since the Bernsteins aren't here,
I can show you the apartment now.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.983
You're lucky to get
a jump on them, actually.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.193
OK, that'd be great.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.736
- So we'll just go up, and...
- Thanks.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.322
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.079
These tend to go pretty quick.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.374
You know, Manhattan is so expensive,
and this is practically in Manhattan.

06:55.499 --> 07:00.212
- I mean, it's five minutes away.
- Yucky. This is yucky.

07:00.337 --> 07:05.259
It is yucky down here, which is why we are
repainting all these lobbies this summer.

07:05.342 --> 07:09.346
And I think they're replacing all the doors, if
I'm not mistaken. It'll make it a lot brighter.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.182
This is Mr. Veeck.
He is the super for building C.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.934
Hello.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.562
Mr. Veeck,
can you say hello?

07:16.687 --> 07:17.938
- Hello.
- This is... What's your name?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.649
- Dahlia. This is Ceci.
- I'm sorry. Dahlia and Ceci.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.443
Uh... Mr. Veeck lives in 1 A.
He's been here for 20 years.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.987
He'll fix anything
that goes wrong.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.655
- Oh, that's good.
- Which is a big savings,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.907
cos he does it for free.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.618
There's also a doorman on duty
from four to midnight here,

07:31.702 --> 07:36.039
so you don't have to worry about
coming in late. And that is the lobby.

07:36.123 --> 07:40.127
Mr. Veeck, if the Bernsteins show up,
just send them right up to 9F.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.545
- OK.
- 9F.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.380
OK.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.258
OK, so,
we'll just head up here.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.594
- Did you take the Tram?
- Yeah.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.096
- Oh, you did. Did you like that?
- Yeah.

07:51.221 --> 07:55.475
You get to do that every day
when you live in this building.

08:00.647 --> 08:04.651
Oh, yeah. There's the camera.
Say hi. Mr. Veeck is watching us.

08:04.735 --> 08:09.156
I'm gonna take you up to nine. Almost our
top floor. I call it the lower penthouse level.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.991
Um...
You get some city views up there.

08:11.074 --> 08:15.579
A little cut off,
but you can still see the city lights, at night.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.207
Oh, you know,
we're two blocks from the school,

08:18.332 --> 08:19.500
which is one of the best
in the city.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.168
Yeah, I was just reading that.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.212
- Isn't that great?
- No.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.048
- I don't like it here, Mommy. I wanna...
- Ceci, please.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.051
- Sorry, Mommy.
- That's OK.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.844
It's OK.
You're gonna love it up here.

08:30.928 --> 08:35.599
And they just opened a pizza place on
the island. Do you like pizza? I bet you do.

08:35.682 --> 08:39.227
I like pizza, too.
I like it a little bit too much.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.813
Wait, sweetie.
Don't run. Don't run.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.785
What the...

09:32.364 --> 09:34.408
Get stuck in here, huh?

09:34.491 --> 09:38.203
- Mommy, what happened?
- Sorry. It's all right.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.623
Dammit.
Another puddle.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.669
Sorry about that. I keep telling Mr. Veeck
he's gotta mop in there every morning.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.629
You know,
with all this rain we're having,

09:47.713 --> 09:50.340
you can't stop some of it
coming down that elevator shaft.

09:50.424 --> 09:54.303
There's just no way to stop it.
Anyway, here's 9F down here.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.140
The building was built in 1976
by Stern-Jackson and associates,

09:58.265 --> 09:59.975
in the brutalist style.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.229
Um... Now, what they were trying to create,
as you can see, was kind of a little village,

10:04.354 --> 10:06.773
kind of a Utopia, actually,
is what they had in mind.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.484
And some of those ideas
have come together.

10:09.610 --> 10:14.948
Some of their original plans for the place
were a little crazy, if you ask me, actually.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.075
Hello.

10:17.201 --> 10:19.870
Yeah, I just do that
just in case. It's vacant.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.330
- Come on in.
- Shall I close this?

10:21.455 --> 10:24.833
Yeah. Let me just apologize in advance.
The place is in a little bit of a mess.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.126
Our last tenant
was a little messy,

10:26.210 --> 10:29.213
but we're gonna put a fresh new
coat of paint on this whole place.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.549
It's gonna brighten it up quite a bit.
Let's take a look at your bedroom, sweetie.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.344
This could be your room
if Mommy wants it to be.

10:35.469 --> 10:39.181
- What do you think? Isn't that great?
- There's no air in here.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.893
Of course there's air in here. If there
wasn't air, we wouldn't be able to breathe.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.855
Uh... That window does not open, but it lets
a lot of natural light in in the afternoons.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.565
- It's really great.
- Strange.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.277
I kinda like it. In the afternoon,
it brightens the place up quite a bit.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.238
Anyway, here's the closet.

10:54.321 --> 11:00.285
You could put your dollies in there,
or, you know, Mom could use it for storage.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.373
- Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
- OK.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.251
Come on, honey.
Is this another closet here?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.420
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.

11:10.504 --> 11:15.133
The bathroom's pretty self-explanatory.
It's in decent shape. Once we clean it up.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.302
You got the toilet, of course,
the sink, bathtub.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.847
This glass is safety glass.

11:19.930 --> 11:23.684
I mean, you could hit that
as hard as you want, it will not break.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.812
And that is great for your peace of mind,
you know, when Ceci's taking a bath.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.941
Hey, Ceci.
Come look in here.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.280
Ah, you're right. That's much better.
You can smell the river. Can you smell it?

11:36.363 --> 11:39.491
- Yeah.
- Let me show you the other bedroom here.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.994
You know, it's tough
to get two bedrooms in Manhattan,

11:42.119 --> 11:45.080
any of the boroughs,
for under a thousand dollars.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.375
OK, that's a closet.
Scratch that. That's a closet.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.753
Um... Kitchen.

11:51.879 --> 11:55.090
Got the refrigerator,
sink, stove,

11:55.215 --> 12:00.095
and this is kind of
a country eat-in dining room.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.140
You see this.
It's just really smart how they did this.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.101
See that little thing?
Boom - dining room.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.145
You can put your stools around it,
and when you're done -

12:08.228 --> 12:10.189
out of the way, no clutter.

12:10.314 --> 12:14.484
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining,
very convenient to have.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.778
Kitchen. OK.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.656
And then here
is the other bedroom.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.661
So, where's the living room?

12:24.745 --> 12:26.246
Well, it's kind of
a living room slash bedroom.

12:26.330 --> 12:30.209
It's called a dual-use room. You can see
it's the size of two rooms. It's huge.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.003
Anyway, did you see the view?
Did you see that?

12:33.086 --> 12:36.215
Look at that. That is a million-dollar view
for $900 a month.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.300
I mean,
I don't even have that where I live.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.054
You're not gonna do better than that,
I guarantee it.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.501
Listen, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here.

13:12.626 --> 13:16.129
We could have this painted this weekend.
You could move in on Monday,

13:16.213 --> 13:18.423
and, you know,
we could just fill out the forms right now.

13:18.549 --> 13:22.010
I understand - you want some time
to walk around, think about it.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.096
- Let me just check on Ceci.
- Sure, sure. Yeah.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.848
Ceci.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.309
She's just making herself at home.
That's OK, Mom.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.603
Ceci.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.064
You know how they are.
She's just exploring.

13:55.836 --> 13:59.381
- Mr. Veeck. Mr. Veeck.
- Did my daughter come down here?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.340
- What?
- My daughter.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.885
- The little girl I came in with.
- The little girl. Did she get on the elevator?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.429
No. I see no one.
Just him.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.849
Yeah, there was a little girl
in the stairwell.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.147
Ceci.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.445
Ceci.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.161
Ceci.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.579
Ceci.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.998
Are you in there?

14:33.123 --> 14:35.709
- Hello.
- Yeah?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.086
- What are you doing down here?
- I saw someone go in.

14:38.212 --> 14:42.216
Did you check the stairs
all the way to the roof?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.385
Ceci.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.101
Look, Mommy.
Hello Kitty. I got a Hello Kitty bag.

14:53.227 --> 14:56.271
Ceci. Don't you ever do that again.
Do you understand?

14:56.396 --> 15:00.234
Don't you ever run away from me,
and you never come up on the roof.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.736
- Sorry.
- Do you understand me?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.739
It's not safe for you up here.
You could have fallen.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.824
- Sorry, Mommy.
- OK?

15:07.908 --> 15:11.578
How can you leave this unlocked? There's
no railing here. It's totally irresponsible.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.748
- It's supposed to be locked.
- Well, it wasn't.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.625
Yeah. Sorry.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.919
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yeah.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.763
You're so lucky you found that.

15:29.847 --> 15:33.392
My niece loves Hello Kitty.
Did you look inside it?

15:33.517 --> 15:36.186
- No. Mommy, can I look?
- It's not yours, sweetie.

15:36.270 --> 15:39.439
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it. There's no
other children in the building. Someone...

15:39.523 --> 15:42.860
No children?
Why? It's so close to the school.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.904
They all grew up.
You know, they're all teenagers now.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.074
You know, hardly anybody
ever moves out cos of rent control.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.244
Oh, there are other children on the island.
You know, in the other buildings.

15:52.369 --> 15:56.331
You would have
many, many friends.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.458
So cute.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.837
Mr. Veeck, why was the door
to the roof open?

16:01.962 --> 16:03.130
- What?
- The roof.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.340
My daughter
found this on the roof.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.177
- The roof? Where?
- Just lying there.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.388
Mr. Veeck. Why didn't you
lock the door to the roof?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.015
- I did.
- No.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.559
She opened it and walked right out.
Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?

16:15.642 --> 16:18.562
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck,
and I'll call the union myself.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.064
You get fired for cause,
and you can kiss that pension goodbye.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.776
What do you talk about?
I check it. Hour ago, it was locked.

16:24.902 --> 16:26.653
- Someone else open it.
- Well, whose bag is this?

16:26.737 --> 16:30.282
- What do I know?
- Well, look inside it, please.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.909
I'm so sorry about this.

16:31.992 --> 16:35.496
As you can see, we're having a little bit of a
communication problem. We'll work it out.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.414
I was wondering
if you have a card, so...

16:37.498 --> 16:39.791
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.668
- Just don't wait too long.
- Hey. Hey.

16:41.752 --> 16:44.963
Ceci.
That's not yours. OK?

16:45.088 --> 16:48.425
You can't keep that. Look, it's brand-new.
Someone's gonna come back for it.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.844
Can you give it back,
please?

16:50.928 --> 16:52.471
- Doll.
- Ceci.

16:52.596 --> 16:55.557
- Aw. Poor thing.
- Good girl. Thank you.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.895
I'll tell you what. Mr. Veeck will hold onto it
for a week, and if no one comes,

17:00.020 --> 17:01.980
then you can come by
and get it. OK?

17:02.105 --> 17:04.233
- In one week.
- No one comes, it's yours.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.901
You see? You'll see,
no one will come.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.694
Thank you, Mr. Veeck.
Please check on that lock again.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.364
Thank you.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.241
We're gonna live here,
right, Mommy?

17:12.366 --> 17:14.910
- What?
- We're gonna move here, right?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.204
I want to.
I really wanna move here.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.790
See?
From the mouths of babes.

17:19.873 --> 17:24.002
- Excuse me just one moment.
- OK.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.378
Talk about it, I guess.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.424
Now, we don't have to move here
for you to get a Hello Kitty backpack.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.717
- I know that.
- You know that?

17:30.801 --> 17:34.221
I really like this place, Mommy.
I wanna live here.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.140
You said it was
the right kind of price for us.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.978
I did say that.
It's a little bit smaller than I hoped.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.772
Please, Mommy.
Can we live here?

17:43.897 --> 17:46.483
I'm over here.
Over here.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.110
Over here.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.869
- We'll take it.
- Oh, I have the Bernsteins...

17:56.994 --> 17:59.663
I'll give you a deposit right now.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.292
- You're sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.085
- OK.
- OK.

18:05.169 --> 18:08.380
Yeah. I have the forms here, if you want.
We can go in... Let's go back in the office.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.216
OK. Ceci,
you wanna come?

18:11.341 --> 18:15.929
I'll be right back. I can explain to them.
That's all right. They have a lot of choices.

18:16.013 --> 18:16.430
Come on.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.974
Cos it's insanely inconvenient,
that's why.

18:19.099 --> 18:22.561
I gotta drive through the tunnel, get uptown
to cross the 59th Street Bridge to Queens,

18:22.686 --> 18:24.938
so I can cross another goddamn bridge
to get to the island.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.481
- You could take the subway.
- The subway?

18:26.607 --> 18:30.068
You want me to take the PATH to the F?
Are you kidding me? It’ll take an hour.

18:30.152 --> 18:30.903
I'm suing.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.821
- What?
- You move there, I'll sue for full custody.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.949
Mr. Williams.
Threats are not appropriate.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.285
- Ms Williams has a right to rent...
- Are you moving to Roosevelt Island?

18:38.368 --> 18:39.661
- Look at this.
- I want an answer.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.873
Look at this. The elementary school there
is one of the best in the city,

18:42.956 --> 18:46.710
and it's practically next door, so all Ceci
would have to do is walk two blocks.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.338
Just look at it.

18:49.463 --> 18:52.007
If this is really about Ceci, maybe
you could move to Roosevelt Island,

18:52.132 --> 18:54.426
cos there are
lots of places for rent there.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.470
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? Why?

18:56.553 --> 18:59.014
- I already signed a lease.
- You're lying.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.641
- I'm not listening to this.
- She's there.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.227
She's in Jersey City,
and that's what this is really about.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.230
I'm done talking.
Better get yourself a lawyer.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.482
A good one.

19:11.652 --> 19:14.363
I'm sorry to say
that's good advice.

19:37.261 --> 19:39.096
- Nobody came, right?
- What?

19:39.179 --> 19:41.473
The Hello Kitty bag.
Nobody came, right?

19:41.598 --> 19:46.353
It's only been four days, kid.
Don't get your hopes up.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.856
Hey.

19:48.939 --> 19:50.983
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.280
- After you, my love.
- Thank you.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.963
Let's try...

20:13.046 --> 20:15.966
- In here?
- No.

20:17.801 --> 20:21.305
I'm ready for something to drink.
How about you?

20:21.388 --> 20:24.308
Or maybe something to eat.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.935
Ooh, let's put you in the box.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.523
Can you
hold your breath underwater?

20:31.648 --> 20:33.734
- Yeah.
- You can?

20:33.859 --> 20:36.195
How long do you think
you can hold it for?

20:36.320 --> 20:37.905
- Seven.
- Really?

20:38.030 --> 20:38.488
Uh-huh.

20:38.572 --> 20:41.116
Look, Mommy.
Look how high I can jump.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.827
Are you trying to break your new bed
on the first night?

20:43.911 --> 20:45.662
- No.
- Don't break your bed.

20:45.746 --> 20:49.249
OK. Look, Mommy.
I'm gonna reach the ceiling.

20:56.590 --> 20:59.551
What is that?

20:59.676 --> 21:01.845
Looks like a leak.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.555
How?

21:05.182 --> 21:08.602
I'll have to tell them about that
in the morning.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.272
Horrible.

21:12.356 --> 21:15.067
Anyway, what shall we read?

21:21.031 --> 21:23.116
Wow.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.410
The sound really carries.

21:25.536 --> 21:26.995
Yeah.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.346
- Mommy.
- Hm?

21:44.471 --> 21:47.307
- Can you fix my hair?
- I'd love to fix your hair.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.603
What do you want?
Do you want a ponytail? Or a braid?

21:51.728 --> 21:53.897
- A braid.
- OK.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.694
You wanna practice for today?

21:58.819 --> 22:00.863
OK.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.240
Boys and girls,

22:03.323 --> 22:06.952
today I want you to meet
your new classmate.

22:07.035 --> 22:12.541
Her name is Cecilia Williams.
Everyone say hello to Cecilia.

22:12.666 --> 22:15.711
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi.

22:18.172 --> 22:21.049
I think
you can do better than that.

22:21.175 --> 22:23.510
Do you wanna try again?

22:23.594 --> 22:25.304
OK.

22:26.930 --> 22:30.309
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.394
That's my girl.

22:32.519 --> 22:38.984
That's my smart,
beautiful, beautiful girl.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.823
How's that?

22:44.948 --> 22:47.493
It's perfect.
You do it perfect.

22:48.368 --> 22:51.455
You get your shoes on,
which are right there.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.249
Keys, which are...

22:55.292 --> 22:57.544
I know where they are.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.299
Shit. Shit!

23:02.382 --> 23:04.134
- Mommy.
- What?

23:04.218 --> 23:06.720
- You cursed.
- Put your shoes on, OK?

23:06.803 --> 23:08.305
OK.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.439
- Do you need help with those?
- Yeah.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.193
Pick up your finger paints
from the back of the room.

23:21.318 --> 23:24.655
Remember to mix the colors.
Red and yellow make...

23:24.738 --> 23:27.741
- Orange.
- Great.

23:27.825 --> 23:30.410
Good morning. Hi.

23:30.494 --> 23:34.206
Hi, Cecilia. You know what?
We are gonna have so much fun today.

23:34.331 --> 23:36.667
We're finger-painting,
so we're gonna get all messy. Look. See?

23:36.750 --> 23:39.628
- The messier the better.
- That's fine.

23:39.753 --> 23:42.005
Are you ready to come
meet all your new friends?

23:42.089 --> 23:45.175
Great. Why don't you come with me,
sweetheart?

23:45.259 --> 23:47.511
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Wanna say goodbye to your mama?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.763
Bye, darling girl.

23:51.265 --> 23:54.309
- I'll be here at 3:30 to pick you up.
- Love you, Mommy.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.354
Oh, I love you so much.
Go have fun.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.606
Come on, sweetheart.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.946
OK, everybody.
Listen up, now.

24:06.029 --> 24:12.661
I want you to give a big, warm, huge
welcome to our new friend Cecilia.

24:12.786 --> 24:18.709
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody. I'm Cecilia.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.879
Hi, Cecilia.

24:21.962 --> 24:24.423
Wow, that was great.

25:01.418 --> 25:05.923
- You want the elevator?
- Uh... Actually, I was looking for you. Um...

25:06.006 --> 25:08.675
There's a leak
in my bedroom ceiling.

25:08.759 --> 25:10.969
Breaking news, huh?

25:11.094 --> 25:15.098
Pipes is 30 years old.
Leaks all over the building.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.686
So does that mean
you won't fix it?

25:19.770 --> 25:24.525
Fix a leak? Look,
all I can do is patch up the ceiling.

25:24.608 --> 25:27.736
If you wanna fix the leak,
you gotta get Murray to call a plumber.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.905
- Mr. Murray.
- Mr. Murray.

25:30.030 --> 25:32.241
OK. I'll call him.

25:32.366 --> 25:34.701
Do.

25:34.785 --> 25:36.453
OK.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.338
So, you worked
as a copy editor?

25:46.463 --> 25:50.259
Yeah. Back in Seattle,
I did copy editing and some fact checking.

25:50.384 --> 25:54.012
Why do you want this job? Pay's
not that good, sure as hell ain't interesting.

25:54.137 --> 25:58.100
Oh, I'd try something different, you know?
I've always been interested in medicine.

25:58.225 --> 26:01.395
Medicine?
Oh, honey, this ain't medicine.

26:01.478 --> 26:04.773
See, what you do is you Xerox
their insurance card, hand them a form,

26:04.898 --> 26:09.069
and give them
a pitcher of bug-juice to drink.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.530
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

26:13.490 --> 26:18.495
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm not exactly a model citizen.

26:21.248 --> 26:23.667
I'm separated from my husband.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.087
My daughter and I
just moved to Roosevelt Island.

26:27.171 --> 26:29.590
You're a five-minute subway ride,

26:29.673 --> 26:34.052
the hours are perfect,
and you have a medical plan.

26:35.679 --> 26:40.184
Well, you're hired, honey.
But you gotta promise me one thing.

26:40.267 --> 26:40.684
What?

26:40.767 --> 26:43.770
In six months' time,
when you find a better job,

26:43.854 --> 26:46.273
please take me with you.

26:46.356 --> 26:49.151
OK. Thank you.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.653
- Hello.
- Hi. Mr. Murray?

26:51.778 --> 26:54.031
- Yeah.
- Hi. It's Dahlia Williams.

26:54.114 --> 26:56.158
- Dahlia Williams.
- From 9F.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.576
- 9F.
- Yeah.

26:57.701 --> 26:58.869
Hey,
how was that paint job?

26:58.952 --> 27:00.078
- Yeah...
- Great work, right?

27:00.204 --> 27:04.708
Thank you, but, um... Actually,
I have a leak in my bedroom ceiling.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.293
- A leak?
- Yeah.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.544
Did you tell Mr. Veeck?

27:07.628 --> 27:10.422
I did, I told him.
He said that he could patch the ceiling,

27:10.547 --> 27:13.217
but that to repair the leak,
you would need to call a plumber.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.801
I don't know
what he's talking about.

27:14.885 --> 27:17.054
If he needs to open the ceiling
and fix the pipe, he can do it.

27:17.137 --> 27:20.015
He doesn't need a plumber.
Listen up.

27:20.140 --> 27:25.604
Just tell him I said... Just tell him
Mr. Murray said that he should fix the leak.

27:25.729 --> 27:27.481
OK. I'll... I'll try.

27:27.564 --> 27:30.526
Listen, say hello
to little Cathy for me, too, OK?

27:30.651 --> 27:31.860
Ceci.

27:31.985 --> 27:33.237
Ceci. I'm sorry.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.196
OK.

27:34.321 --> 27:37.241
OK. Bye-bye.

27:49.253 --> 27:51.672
Yes!

28:05.769 --> 28:06.812
- Hi.
- It's lunch hour.

28:06.937 --> 28:08.897
Just quickly.
I spoke to Mr. Murray,

28:09.022 --> 28:11.567
and he said that you should
fix that leak that I told you about.

28:11.692 --> 28:15.195
Look, I'm not a plumber.
I keep telling him.

28:15.279 --> 28:17.322
I'm not responsible
for building's plumbing.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.533
My job is make sure
boiler's working,

28:19.616 --> 28:21.952
mop floors, put out the garbage,
but I'm not a plumber.

28:22.035 --> 28:25.664
No, I understand. It's just Murray said
that you could fix it.

28:25.789 --> 28:27.916
Well, I can't.

29:27.434 --> 29:30.020
- Hello.
- Wouldn't stop, right? Took you up to ten?

29:30.103 --> 29:32.856
Yeah, it does that sometimes. It just
goes up to ten, no one's even called for it.

29:32.940 --> 29:36.193
I think when it rains a lot, it messes with
the contacts or something. Which floor?

29:36.276 --> 29:38.111
- Nine, please.
- OK, we'll take you back up,

29:38.195 --> 29:39.279
and then I'll go down.

29:39.363 --> 29:40.948
OK. Thank you.

29:41.031 --> 29:43.116
Shit. Come on.

29:46.787 --> 29:48.914
Who did this?

29:50.040 --> 29:52.209
This building is falling apart.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.258
- Bye.
- See ya later.

31:51.995 --> 31:53.664
I've talked to Veeck
twice now,

31:53.747 --> 31:56.083
and he says he's not a plumber
and he can't fix it,

31:56.166 --> 31:59.962
so I'm wondering, is there a super from
one of the other buildings who could do it?

32:00.087 --> 32:03.215
I can't do that.
See, C is Veeck, and Veeck is C.

32:03.340 --> 32:08.220
If I do that, then I have the union screaming
at me about violating work rules.

32:08.345 --> 32:13.225
It's really coming down now, and I can
hear there's running water upstairs, so...

32:13.350 --> 32:16.186
You know, it might not even be a leak.
It might be flooded or something.

32:16.270 --> 32:19.189
- Did you say "upstairs"?
- Right above me.

32:19.273 --> 32:20.983
- In 10F?
- Upstairs.

32:21.108 --> 32:24.236
You know, maybe it's their tub that's
overflowed or something, I don't know.

32:24.361 --> 32:25.529
No, that can't be right.

32:25.612 --> 32:28.699
Listen, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna call Mr. Veeck personally, OK?

32:28.782 --> 32:29.908
I'm gonna take care of this.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.244
So don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get right on it.

32:32.369 --> 32:36.290
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now. I'll call
you later, as soon as I take care of it, OK?

32:36.373 --> 32:39.376
- Thank you.
- OK. No problem. Bye-bye.

33:24.838 --> 33:28.008
Mommy, wake up.

33:29.676 --> 33:31.678
Ceci?

34:06.296 --> 34:08.297
Hello.

34:18.141 --> 34:20.101
Hello.

34:40.164 --> 34:41.373
Hello.

35:32.966 --> 35:34.468
Oh, God.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.678
Oh, God.

35:46.146 --> 35:49.024
What are you doing here?

35:49.149 --> 35:51.401
Take it easy.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.195
It's flooded.

35:53.320 --> 35:56.406
The fuckin' brats.
I'm gonna kill 'em.

35:56.490 --> 35:58.492
- You see them coming outta here?
- Who?

35:58.575 --> 36:03.413
Asshole Steve. 3F.
And his buddy, dumb Billy, 7E.

36:03.497 --> 36:04.957
- You don't know them?
- No.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.209
Look.
Here's the story.

36:07.334 --> 36:11.213
10F's away.
Father's left the country.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.841
Where the mother is,
God knows.

36:14.842 --> 36:18.595
They've been away for months.
Probably not coming back.

36:18.679 --> 36:20.722
Those punks have stolen a key
and get in here.

36:20.848 --> 36:22.683
- Why?
- What do I know?

36:22.766 --> 36:26.478
Drugs.
Wacky baccy, you know.

36:26.603 --> 36:30.691
Look, I clean up this place, and then...
Then I come down to your place, huh?

36:30.774 --> 36:34.278
Murray called me.
I tell him I take care of it.

36:46.373 --> 36:49.793
Yeah. I patch it up tomorrow,
when it's dry.

36:49.877 --> 36:51.920
- No extra charge, you know?
- Thank you.

36:52.045 --> 36:55.841
The itsy-bitsy spider

36:55.966 --> 36:59.178
- Went up the waterspout
- Then what?

36:59.261 --> 37:01.305
Down came the rain

37:01.388 --> 37:03.515
- And it washed the spider out
- OK.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.516
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

37:04.641 --> 37:06.727
You can be 10,
even 15 minutes late.

37:06.852 --> 37:10.147
We have this after-school program
that runs until 5:30, so...

37:10.230 --> 37:13.317
- Many of the kids stay for it.
- Uh... Is there a charge for that?

37:13.400 --> 37:16.195
It's $30 a week.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.989
- Which is actually quite reasonable.
- No, that's good. That's good.

37:19.072 --> 37:22.201
I think I'll have to do that,
cos I'll be working till five every day.

37:22.326 --> 37:24.286
- OK. Well, we can set that up.
- OK.

37:24.411 --> 37:29.082
Surprise, surprise, there's another form
you have to fill out, but we can do that now.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.792
This will be good for Cecilia.

37:30.918 --> 37:35.297
It will help her fit in faster, and she could
use some real friends, don't you think?

37:35.422 --> 37:36.298
What do you mean?

37:36.423 --> 37:39.676
Well, it's not unusual
to have imaginary friends at this age.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.637
Nowadays we know
not to bug them about it,

37:41.762 --> 37:46.141
but it isn't so great
that she's playing with an imaginary friend

37:46.266 --> 37:48.685
when there are real children
for her to play with here.

37:48.810 --> 37:51.647
Are you saying
that Ceci has an imaginary friend?

37:51.772 --> 37:54.024
And washed the spider out

37:54.107 --> 37:58.946
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain

37:59.029 --> 38:02.241
And the itsy-bitsy spider

38:02.366 --> 38:06.453
Went up the spout again

38:06.537 --> 38:09.706
I made you a snack for after school.
I had it all wrapped up and ready to go,

38:09.790 --> 38:11.667
and then I was rushing,
and I forgot it.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.794
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

38:15.295 --> 38:17.631
- What did you think of your teacher?
- She was very nice.

38:17.756 --> 38:20.175
- Did you make any friends today?
- Uh-huh.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.094
Who?

38:23.053 --> 38:24.680
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

38:24.763 --> 38:26.515
Very funny name
for a friend, "Nobody. "

38:26.598 --> 38:29.101
- Mommy.
- Nobody. "My name is Nobody. "

38:34.439 --> 38:36.358
- Did anyone come?
- What?

38:36.483 --> 38:38.610
For Hello Kitty.
Did anyone come?

38:38.735 --> 38:40.445
No. Not yet.

38:40.571 --> 38:42.948
Thanks for taking care of the ceiling
tomorrow. I appreciate it.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.409
It looks really ugly now.

38:45.492 --> 38:47.119
Good.

38:47.661 --> 38:49.663
Are you gonna stay
in my bed tonight?

38:50.164 --> 38:52.291
Close your eyes.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.922
I'm very proud of you
for today.

39:00.215 --> 39:02.301
Sweet dreams, honey.

39:12.936 --> 39:18.483
The itsy-bitsy spider

39:18.609 --> 39:22.821
Went up the waterspout

39:23.947 --> 39:27.618
Down came the rain

39:27.701 --> 39:31.288
And washed the spider out

39:31.371 --> 39:34.875
Out came the sun

39:34.958 --> 39:38.378
And dried up all the rain

39:38.462 --> 39:43.300
- The itsy-bitsy spider
- Itsy-bitsy spider...

39:43.383 --> 39:48.222
- Went up the spout again
- ... the spout again

39:50.474 --> 39:54.770
Well, I still don't really know anyone here,
so I'm not really sure who to ask.

39:54.895 --> 40:00.776
Except Bill and Stacy, but he's
Kyle's friend from work, so I can't ask him.

40:00.901 --> 40:03.737
I think it'd be a lot easier for her
back there in Seattle, you know?

40:03.821 --> 40:07.157
Well, what about the mediators?
Maybe they can recommend somebody.

40:07.241 --> 40:09.743
Yeah, I asked them,
but they're supposed to be impartial

40:09.827 --> 40:13.205
- so they can't recommend anyone.
- Oh.

40:13.330 --> 40:17.751
I don't know. I guess maybe I'll try and
find someone out of the Yellow Pages.

40:17.835 --> 40:23.298
Dahlia, you can't pick some
random lawyer out of a phone book.

40:23.382 --> 40:25.968
I can't believe it.
Those kids are up there again.

40:26.093 --> 40:27.761
What?

40:27.845 --> 40:29.680
Mary, I'm gonna have
to call you back later, OK?

40:29.763 --> 40:32.182
I have to go downstairs
and deal with this.

40:32.266 --> 40:34.059
- All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
- Bye.

40:38.355 --> 40:41.316
Stop it. She'll catch you.

40:42.276 --> 40:45.362
No, I'm not allowed to go to the roof.

40:45.445 --> 40:49.950
Cos it's dangerous,
and by the ways, it's spooky at night.

40:51.034 --> 40:54.288
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

40:56.206 --> 40:59.501
Is it your friend Nobody again?

41:06.049 --> 41:11.096
Do you have an invisible friend
only you can see?

41:14.892 --> 41:17.144
Is it a boy or a girl?

41:17.227 --> 41:19.271
Girl.

41:19.396 --> 41:23.525
- How old is she?
- My age. Almost exactly.

41:23.609 --> 41:27.696
She was born a month before me.
So she's older.

41:27.779 --> 41:30.908
Wow. What's her name?

41:30.991 --> 41:34.328
- Natasha.
- Natasha?

41:35.329 --> 41:38.957
That's a really interesting name.
Where'd you get that name from?

41:39.082 --> 41:41.210
It's just her name.

41:41.335 --> 41:43.420
Night, Mom.

41:45.589 --> 41:49.593
I can't go up to 10F now. If I leave my post
and Mr. Murray finds out, I'm dead.

41:49.676 --> 41:53.180
OK, but if they leave the water running
then my bedroom ceiling could collapse.

41:53.305 --> 41:55.265
- Understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

41:55.390 --> 41:57.226
But what you gotta understand
is if I leave now

41:57.351 --> 41:59.770
I might as well go straight to
Unemployment. That's not gonna happen.

41:59.853 --> 42:03.232
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if
you want me to call the cops or something.

42:03.357 --> 42:06.693
- Just give me a second. Hang on.
- It's all right, never mind.

42:06.777 --> 42:10.072
I'll deal with it. And thanks for your help.

42:10.197 --> 42:12.074
All right.

43:05.794 --> 43:08.589
Mommy, come.

44:01.308 --> 44:03.810
Are you OK?

44:03.936 --> 44:06.271
Can I help you?

44:12.986 --> 44:16.281
I told you. I told you to leave me alone.

44:17.324 --> 44:19.910
Mom?

44:19.993 --> 44:23.956
- Get away from me, you little bitch.
- Mommy?

44:24.081 --> 44:27.334
- I hate you.
- Let me help you.

44:27.417 --> 44:30.045
I hate you.

44:30.170 --> 44:34.466
- Do you hear me? I hate you.
- No.

44:35.467 --> 44:37.928
Just go! Go!

44:44.935 --> 44:47.062
Mommy.

44:47.187 --> 44:48.438
Wh...

44:48.522 --> 44:50.899
- What?
- You're scaring me.

44:51.024 --> 44:55.779
- What's wrong?
- You were having a bad dream again.

44:55.863 --> 44:58.240
Again?

44:58.365 --> 45:01.118
You always make that sound
when you sleep.

45:01.201 --> 45:02.786
I do?

45:02.870 --> 45:04.913
Ever since Daddy left.

45:05.038 --> 45:07.207
- Stop doing that, OK?
- OK.

45:07.291 --> 45:11.962
- It scares me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

45:12.045 --> 45:14.214
It's OK.

45:15.215 --> 45:17.426
There's nothing to be scared of.

45:47.748 --> 45:51.627
- Have a good day. See you later.
- OK. Bye, Mommy.

45:56.590 --> 45:59.051
Yeah, he was a frat brother
of Joe's at Wash U.

45:59.176 --> 46:00.844
Joe says he's as smart as a whip.

46:00.928 --> 46:03.305
If he was at college with Joe
I guess he's been practicing for a while.

46:03.430 --> 46:05.849
Well, actually, he got a late start
on being a lawyer.

46:05.933 --> 46:08.268
- He lost a decade to partying.
- A decade?

46:08.352 --> 46:10.270
No, seriously, Joe says he's really good

46:10.354 --> 46:12.189
and he won't charge you
an arm and a leg.

46:12.272 --> 46:14.691
- His name is Platzer.
- OK.

46:14.775 --> 46:16.902
- P-L-A...
- Right.

46:17.027 --> 46:18.529
...T-Z-E-R.

46:19.029 --> 46:23.075
Come on, Platz.
This mess was sloppy, unprofessional.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.829
I mean, I know I get caught,
but my work? My craft?

46:26.954 --> 46:29.623
My craft ain't sloppy.

46:29.706 --> 46:31.625
That much is true.

46:31.708 --> 46:33.418
- Thank you.
- Hello?

46:33.544 --> 46:35.587
Mr. Platzer, hi.
My name is Dahlia Williams.

46:35.712 --> 46:39.049
Hi, Mrs. Williams.
John told me you'd be calling.

46:39.132 --> 46:43.178
I can't meet till next week, so you give me
opposing counsel's name and number

46:43.303 --> 46:45.973
and I'll give him a call
and get up to speed on their issues.

46:46.056 --> 46:48.725
Sure. My husband's lawyer's name
is Carrie Simmons.

46:48.809 --> 46:52.187
That's OK, I know Carrie's number.
This is not gonna be so easy.

46:52.312 --> 46:55.524
We should meet Monday. Where do you
work? I'll come by in your lunch hour.

46:55.649 --> 47:00.154
It's Sutton Place Radiology.
585 East 58th Street.

47:00.237 --> 47:03.574
You're being very nice,
but I'm sorry, I just have to ask.

47:03.657 --> 47:06.702
- How much is that gonna cost me?
- We'll figure the money out.

47:06.827 --> 47:09.872
I'll call Carrie, get up to speed,
then we'll go over everything Monday,

47:09.997 --> 47:13.167
- including my fee, OK?
- OK. Thanks so much.

47:13.250 --> 47:15.586
- OK. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

47:15.669 --> 47:19.673
Figure the money out? That's some
sweet thing you're figuring money for.

47:19.756 --> 47:24.636
- You gonna figure my money too?
- You're lucky I don't charge you double.

47:24.761 --> 47:27.639
OK, so everyone looking at me.
And do you all have a piece of tape?

47:27.764 --> 47:30.184
Show me, show me. Put it somewhere silly.

47:30.267 --> 47:33.187
Somewhere silly. Your forehead,
your nose. Make a beard. OK.

47:33.270 --> 47:35.397
Now put it on the back of your picture

47:35.522 --> 47:38.192
and then you're gonna follow me into the
hallway cos we're gonna put them up.

47:38.275 --> 47:43.989
Ten, nine, eight, a-seven, a-six,
five, four, three, two, one.

47:44.114 --> 47:46.783
Beautiful.

47:46.867 --> 47:48.869
- Anyone else need tape?
- I do.

47:48.952 --> 47:50.579
If it's not sticking...

47:50.704 --> 47:52.789
- Mom, you're early.
- I know.

47:52.873 --> 47:55.209
The subway was so much faster
than the Tram.

47:55.292 --> 47:57.711
I was at work ten minutes ago.
Isn't that amazing?

47:57.794 --> 48:01.757
- I think we picked the perfect place to live.
- Daddy doesn't like it here.

48:01.882 --> 48:04.885
He wants me to move with him
to that other city.

48:04.968 --> 48:06.053
Oh.

48:06.136 --> 48:07.763
- When did Daddy say that?
- Today.

48:07.888 --> 48:11.683
He came to see
what my new school was like.

48:11.808 --> 48:12.768
Hm.

48:12.893 --> 48:15.145
- I gotta go.
- OK. I'll be waiting for you.

48:15.229 --> 48:17.481
OK.

48:18.398 --> 48:22.236
Yeah, he came by to give us his cell phone
number in case of an emergency.

48:22.319 --> 48:28.116
He was with Cecilia for a few minutes.
He said hi, he looked at the room.

48:29.243 --> 48:31.912
Is there some problem?
Is he not allowed to?

48:31.995 --> 48:33.997
Is there some restraining order
against him?

48:34.081 --> 48:37.501
No. No.

48:37.584 --> 48:41.129
I was just... wondering if Ceci was...

48:41.255 --> 48:43.715
Still imagining things?

48:43.841 --> 48:48.178
Actually, I'm glad you brought that up.
Her imaginary friend hasn't gone away.

48:48.262 --> 48:51.765
In fact, she threw somewhat of a tantrum
during circle time

48:51.849 --> 48:54.101
when we wouldn't let her "friend"
sing along.

48:54.184 --> 48:56.728
I had to have her take a time-out.

48:56.854 --> 49:02.025
I'm sorry. I'll certainly
talk to Ceci about that.

49:02.109 --> 49:05.195
You know, the PTA provides
a psychologist, Katie Shoettle.

49:05.279 --> 49:09.449
She's very nice. She comes every
Wednesday. It's absolutely no charge.

49:09.533 --> 49:13.745
I'll talk to Ceci about it. It'll stop.
I'm really sorry about that.

49:14.788 --> 49:17.708
You'll see. Couple of days, blend right in.

49:17.791 --> 49:20.252
You won't see the difference.

49:21.211 --> 49:24.256
I'm sure you're right. Thank you.

49:25.799 --> 49:29.386
You know, those kids were up there
again last night, running around,

49:29.469 --> 49:32.222
and I could hear them running water. So...

49:32.306 --> 49:33.765
You know what I'm gonna do?

49:33.891 --> 49:37.561
I'm gonna speak with Murray
about changing the lock on 10F.

49:37.644 --> 49:40.606
You know what he told me?
Rimsky paid no rent this month.

49:40.731 --> 49:43.150
- He's probably not coming back anyway.
- OK.

49:43.233 --> 49:45.777
Well, that would be great
if you could change the lock.

49:45.903 --> 49:48.363
Starting to have nightmares
about what's going on up there.

49:48.489 --> 49:52.075
- Really? You gotta relax, huh?
- Can I get you something before you go?

49:52.159 --> 49:55.204
Yeah. Get me a reward
for all this hard work I've been doing.

49:55.329 --> 49:57.831
Yeah? I think I have beer.

49:57.915 --> 50:00.250
- You want a beer?
- I don't drink beer.

50:00.334 --> 50:02.503
Coffee? I could make a pot of coffee
if you want.

50:02.586 --> 50:06.089
Oh, forget it. I've been working hard today.
I'm tired. I'm going.

50:06.173 --> 50:07.424
OK. Well, thank you.

50:07.508 --> 50:09.843
What about Hello Kitty? Can I have it now?

50:09.927 --> 50:13.055
Oh, so sorry, kid.
Somebody came by for it today.

50:13.180 --> 50:16.016
They were visiting town,
left it there by accident.

50:16.099 --> 50:19.728
Oh, that little girl,
she was so happy to have it back.

50:20.270 --> 50:21.897
- You're lying.
- Ceci.

50:22.022 --> 50:24.691
He's lying, Mommy. Nobody came.

50:24.775 --> 50:27.110
You want to teach that goddamn brat
some manners, lady.

50:27.194 --> 50:29.613
Sorry.

50:30.447 --> 50:32.574
What is the matter with you?

50:32.699 --> 50:33.575
Mm.

50:33.700 --> 50:37.579
Mac and cheese. My favorite.
I love you, Mommy.

50:37.704 --> 50:40.040
I love you too, sweetheart.
I love you very much.

50:40.123 --> 50:43.001
But, you know, it was very wrong of you
to call Mr. Veeck a liar.

50:43.126 --> 50:46.880
- You know that, don't you?
- He is a liar.

50:46.964 --> 50:50.259
Ceci. You don't know that he's a liar.

50:50.384 --> 50:52.761
- Yes, I do.
- How? How do you know that?

50:52.886 --> 50:57.891
Natasha told me he still had
the Hello Kitty backpack in his desk.

50:57.975 --> 51:00.435
I want to talk to you
about your imaginary friend, OK?

51:00.561 --> 51:04.231
- She's not imaginary.
- She's not?

51:04.314 --> 51:08.861
She's lost. Her mommy forgot about her
and now she's lost.

51:09.903 --> 51:12.281
Like you.

51:13.657 --> 51:18.328
- What are you talking about?
- Your mommy forgot about you, right?

51:19.329 --> 51:21.456
Did someone tell you that?

51:22.583 --> 51:25.294
- You did.
- No.

51:25.419 --> 51:28.672
I didn't tell you that, Ceci.

51:28.755 --> 51:31.592
Who told you that?

51:34.261 --> 51:37.723
Are you gonna answer me?
I'm asking you a question.

51:37.848 --> 51:40.184
- Who told you?
- Natasha told me.

51:40.267 --> 51:43.770
Stop it. You stop lying to me.

51:43.854 --> 51:46.064
Who told you?

51:47.941 --> 51:49.568
Who told you?

51:49.693 --> 51:52.237
Who told you?

51:59.286 --> 52:01.663
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm just calling to arrange...

52:01.788 --> 52:06.793
What are you trying to do? Sneaking into
her school, telling her it isn't any good?

52:06.877 --> 52:10.130
Talking to her about my mother?
How dare you talk to her about my mother.

52:10.214 --> 52:13.967
Look, I don't know who or what pressed
your wacko button today, and I don't care,

52:14.051 --> 52:16.762
I'm calling to tell you I'm picking up Ceci
Saturday at nine.

52:16.887 --> 52:20.516
I'll bring her back Sunday at six.
Don't play any games.

52:20.641 --> 52:22.893
Have her there, 9am sharp.

52:51.421 --> 52:55.384
- I tell you punks. No skating in here.
- Yeah, yeah.

52:58.011 --> 53:00.931
She's cute.

53:01.598 --> 53:03.934
Daddy's here!

53:04.017 --> 53:06.061
Hey!

53:06.186 --> 53:08.105
Look at you.

53:09.439 --> 53:11.483
You shouldn't be smoking, Daddy.

53:11.608 --> 53:13.694
I'm gonna quit real soon, honey. I promise.

53:13.777 --> 53:18.365
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Satisfied?

53:18.448 --> 53:21.577
As far as I'm concerned,
you can smoke as much as you like, Kyle.

53:21.702 --> 53:23.620
Honey.

53:23.704 --> 53:26.331
- I'll bring her back tomorrow at six.
- OK.

53:26.456 --> 53:28.917
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, honey.

54:04.912 --> 54:07.748
Hey, pretty lady. What's happening?

54:07.831 --> 54:10.626
Laundry. Excuse me.

54:10.751 --> 54:14.213
I got some dirty things I'd like you to clean.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.728
Sorry.

55:12.896 --> 55:15.357
I forgot my smokes.

57:27.698 --> 57:29.908
Help!

57:32.786 --> 57:37.207
Smart-ass kids.
Steve and Billy. They did this.

57:37.291 --> 57:41.587
You'll see. Monday, the plumbers come.
They'll find something stuck in there.

57:41.712 --> 57:43.922
They gum 'em up. Brats.

57:44.965 --> 57:47.301
- Who's Natasha?
- What?

57:47.968 --> 57:50.554
Who's Natasha Rimsky?

57:50.637 --> 57:54.099
Little girl. 10F.

57:55.225 --> 57:58.812
- Where is she now?
- How do I know? With her mother, I guess.

57:58.896 --> 58:01.482
Couldn't stand living
with that crazy Russian husband of hers.

58:01.565 --> 58:05.861
Took the little girl with her.
That Russki, he was a piece of work.

58:08.822 --> 58:10.616
Always "blyad".

58:10.741 --> 58:13.285
Look, there's a Laundromat
down the block.

58:13.410 --> 58:18.248
I'll get you some garbage bags
so you don't get wet carrying them there.

59:23.230 --> 59:30.279
The itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

01:00:02.352 --> 01:00:04.480
Hi, Mommy.

01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:11.153
Glad you like spaghetti and meatballs.

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:14.948
- It's my favorite.
- Your favorite?

01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:17.826
I love them, Mommy.

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:20.204
I'm glad.

01:00:20.287 --> 01:00:22.164
Mm.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.459
I love you, Mommy.

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:28.045
You haven't said anything
about what your dad's new place is like.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:29.213
- I don't like it.
- Really?

01:00:29.296 --> 01:00:30.380
Yeah.

01:00:30.464 --> 01:00:32.424
Well, maybe it's just new
and you need to get used to it.

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:34.760
But I don't wanna get used to it.

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:39.932
I don't wanna stay with Daddy.
I only wanna stay with you.

01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:45.729
Well, your dad loves you. He'll be happy
that you spent this time with him.

01:00:45.813 --> 01:00:51.652
Itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.154
Down came the rain

01:00:54.238 --> 01:00:58.033
- Honey, can you stop singing that?
- Why? It happened.

01:00:58.158 --> 01:01:00.828
I want to go to bed now, Mommy. I'm tired.

01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:13.841
- Mommy?
- Mm?

01:01:13.924 --> 01:01:17.427
I'm scared, Mommy.
I want to sleep with you.

01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:19.638
Yeah.

01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:37.823
I love you, Mommy.
Thank you for taking care of me.

01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:07.436
Ceci?

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:20.532
- Hello?
- Mommy, where were you?

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:24.453
- I was napping.
- No, not now. Last night.

01:02:24.578 --> 01:02:29.666
Where were you last night? I called
two times for you to say goodnight to me.

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:32.377
- Where were you?
- Last night?

01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:37.674
OK, Daddy. Daddy says he's bringing
me home a half an hour early.

01:02:37.758 --> 01:02:40.260
OK, Daddy. 5:30.

01:02:40.344 --> 01:02:42.930
He says to be there in the lobby at 5:30.

01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:45.182
- Don't fall asleep again, Mommy.
- OK.

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:47.976
I gotta go. I'm getting chocolate cake.

01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:49.728
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:52.439
Dahlia, where have you been?
I left two messages.

01:02:52.523 --> 01:02:54.942
I lost a day, Mary.

01:02:55.025 --> 01:03:00.197
I took a pill, just one pill,
and it knocked me out for 24 hours.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.115
That's never happened before.

01:03:02.199 --> 01:03:07.704
And I'm tired, really tired.
It's like I haven't slept at all.

01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:11.834
Dahlia, are you OK? Are you really OK?

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:15.504
My headache's gone. But the leak is back.

01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:19.800
It's back?
I thought they were gonna fix that thing.

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:23.178
- Dahlia?
- Yeah?

01:03:23.303 --> 01:03:27.683
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:28.392 --> 01:03:31.728
You have five new messages.
First new message.

01:03:31.812 --> 01:03:34.982
Long nap, huh? Call me.

01:03:35.065 --> 01:03:37.401
Message erased.
Next message.

01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:41.113
Hi, Jeff Platzer here. I got the preliminaries
from your husband's lawyer

01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:44.491
and I need to touch base with you about
his accusations as soon as possible.

01:03:44.575 --> 01:03:47.995
Believe it or not I'm actually available
on Sunday afternoon until five.

01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:51.540
If you are, would you call my cell?
OK. Bye.

01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:03.093
- Mrs. Williams?
- Yeah.

01:04:03.177 --> 01:04:05.762
Hi. I'm your lawyer.

01:04:05.846 --> 01:04:08.265
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:09.266 --> 01:04:11.602
- I'm sorry it's such a mess.
- No, it's OK.

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:15.105
I just moved into a new office
and they've painted it.

01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:17.774
I can't stand the smell so I'm improvising.

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:21.028
OK.

01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:29.036
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:32.581
- So...
- OK.

01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:37.169
Your husband's claiming
you're mentally unstable

01:04:37.294 --> 01:04:39.796
because your father
was physically abusive

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.550
and your mother was an alcoholic
who abandoned you.

01:04:43.634 --> 01:04:45.719
That's...

01:04:47.638 --> 01:04:49.932
unbelievable.

01:04:50.057 --> 01:04:54.144
- What do my parents have to do with this?
- That's my question exactly.

01:04:54.228 --> 01:04:59.024
What's more relevant is that your husband
says you suffer from crippling migraines

01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:01.318
and paranoid delusions.

01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:02.778
He says he'll submit school reports

01:05:02.903 --> 01:05:06.448
that show your daughter
is beginning to share your fantasy life.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:08.075
"Cecilia is now having trouble

01:05:08.158 --> 01:05:10.536
distinguishing between
what is real and what is not. "

01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:12.579
It's a lie. It's a lie.

01:05:12.663 --> 01:05:15.582
In child custody briefs, it's standard
to make these kinds of accusations.

01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:17.084
Don't take it too seriously.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:21.171
But I do need to know what, if anything,
in your husband's narrative

01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:26.677
has some semblance, some shred of fact
that he might produce in court.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.140
Well, I get migraines.
Yeah. That's true.

01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:35.477
But they've never interfered
with my ability to do anything.

01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:41.066
You can talk to my doctor about that. He'll
tell you they've certainly never crippled me.

01:05:41.191 --> 01:05:42.651
Um...

01:05:42.776 --> 01:05:47.823
As for Ceci, I think
she's a little bit lonely right now.

01:05:47.948 --> 01:05:51.118
Her father's abandoned her and she was
forced to move from her neighborhood.

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:53.620
So...

01:05:53.704 --> 01:05:58.333
she's developed an imaginary friend.
But that's normal.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:05.132
That's fine. But for future reference, when
you're talking to, for example, a judge,

01:06:05.215 --> 01:06:07.926
I would stay away from phrases like,
"her father's abandoned her".

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:11.054
It's important, when the other side
is being so melodramatic,

01:06:11.138 --> 01:06:14.600
- to sound like we're the sane ones.
- Right.

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:17.311
- That's all I'm saying.
- OK.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.625
- I'd like to notch that.
- Oh, yeah, man.

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:49.426
Hey, sweetheart.

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:53.597
- Mommy?
- Yeah.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.184
- Look what Daddy gave me.
- Wow.

01:06:57.267 --> 01:07:02.231
- That's great, You're so lucky.
- Listen, next Saturday's a problem.

01:07:02.356 --> 01:07:04.316
Can we do Sunday and I'll bring her
first thing in the morning

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.693
for school on Monday?

01:07:06.777 --> 01:07:09.696
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

01:07:11.198 --> 01:07:14.910
- Come on, honey. Say bye to Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy. Thanks for the Barbie.

01:07:15.035 --> 01:07:17.746
- Did you do that ponytail by yourself?
- Yeah.

01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:20.290
- It's a good one.
- Thanks.

01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:28.298
- I like the collar.
- Thanks.

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:35.681
Honey, you know what,
I forgot to do something.

01:07:35.806 --> 01:07:37.975
I'm gonna be right back.
Will you wait right here for me?

01:07:38.058 --> 01:07:40.185
- Don't go anywhere, OK?
- OK.

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:41.311
Be right back.

01:07:41.395 --> 01:07:45.107
Two... one.

01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:22.019
Ceci?

01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:27.064
Ceci? Stay in the elevator.
I'm bringing you down.

01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:32.069
Ceci, can you hear me?

01:08:37.367 --> 01:08:42.163
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Roll it, pat it and mark it with a B.

01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:45.917
- No more pretending to play with Natasha.
- She won't let me.

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:49.587
Well, then you stop talking to her.
You tell her I said so.

01:08:49.712 --> 01:08:52.841
You tell her your mommy said
you can't play with her any more.

01:08:52.966 --> 01:08:55.219
OK, Mommy.

01:09:00.474 --> 01:09:02.184
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.

01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:05.395
I'm sorry to call you late,
but I think my husband...

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.481
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night.
I can't talk.

01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:11.609
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just need
to tell you this as soon as possible.

01:09:11.734 --> 01:09:13.821
I think my husband
is trying to drive me crazy.

01:09:13.904 --> 01:09:15.863
Either that or he's hoping
that I'm gonna act crazy.

01:09:15.988 --> 01:09:19.701
- Hang on. Let me call you right back.
- OK.

01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:23.663
You say neither of the Rimskys
are living there?

01:09:23.747 --> 01:09:26.082
No, no one's there.
So Kyle's paying these kids.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.835
I mean, he must be paying these kids

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:30.796
to mess around with the water
and the backpack. And the elevator.

01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:34.383
I went into the elevator the other day
and the buttons were burned off.

01:09:34.508 --> 01:09:37.594
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night
and I'm at the movies with my family.

01:09:37.678 --> 01:09:41.598
If I don't want to be handling
my own divorce, I gotta get back. So...

01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:43.934
I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll sort this out. All right?

01:09:44.017 --> 01:09:45.435
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:53.569
Get down!

01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:21.054
This time make sure
you put it in the garbage truck.

01:10:21.138 --> 01:10:23.265
- Where did you...
- Those kids have been playing games,

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:24.933
moving it around the building.

01:10:25.058 --> 01:10:29.271
And they were upstairs again so now
there's water all over my bedroom floor.

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:31.440
- They're running the water again?
- Mm-hm.

01:10:31.565 --> 01:10:33.567
I thought you were gonna
change the lock on 10F.

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:37.154
Murray didn't authorize it.
He has to send me a 112B form.

01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:40.949
- Look, is the plumber here yet?
- No, no. It's only 8:15.

01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:45.579
OK, look. I left a message for Mr. Murray.
I told him I need my problem fixed first.

01:10:45.662 --> 01:10:48.332
So when the plumber gets here,
send him up to my apartment

01:10:48.415 --> 01:10:52.461
or you and Murray
can both talk to my lawyer. OK?

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:08.685
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

01:11:08.769 --> 01:11:11.939
- Yes, Mommy.
- OK.

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:16.652
See you later, OK?

01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:19.822
- Hello.
- Hi. Jeff Platzer here.

01:11:19.947 --> 01:11:23.033
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.
- Listen, I did a little homework on Rimsky

01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:25.911
and I think I turned up the missing mother
in a hospital in San Diego.

01:11:26.036 --> 01:11:27.162
Why are you looking for her?

01:11:27.287 --> 01:11:30.874
I figured the Rimskys might want to know
their apartment's being used by strangers.

01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:33.961
Mrs. Williams, we're never gonna prove
your husband's behind this harassment.

01:11:34.086 --> 01:11:38.173
And trying to do that is just playing
his game. He wants you to look paranoid.

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.384
We gotta deal with this straight,
as if it's all on the level.

01:11:40.467 --> 01:11:42.761
So that's what we'll do,
we'll play it straight.

01:11:42.886 --> 01:11:45.347
I'm due in court, I'll call you
when I get ahold of Mrs. Rimsky.

01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:48.225
In the meantime, just sit tight.

01:11:48.308 --> 01:11:50.853
- I will. Thanks so much.
- OK.

01:11:50.978 --> 01:11:53.188
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:53.313 --> 01:11:56.859
- Abigail's making a storm, sweetheart.
- Done!

01:11:56.984 --> 01:12:00.070
Done? You remember you have
to sign your name so you know whose it is.

01:12:00.195 --> 01:12:04.408
You don't want me to take that home
and say I did it, do you?

01:12:04.491 --> 01:12:07.411
I like that. Pirates?

01:12:09.246 --> 01:12:11.456
Stop it.

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:15.085
Stop it, I told you, leave me alone.

01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:17.421
- We've got rainbows...
- Stop it!

01:12:18.088 --> 01:12:20.549
Stop it!

01:12:20.757 --> 01:12:22.926
Stop it!

01:12:23.135 --> 01:12:25.220
Stop it!

01:12:30.392 --> 01:12:32.019
You're gonna get cleaned up
and when you're done

01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:36.148
you're gonna come back and sit with me
and we'll read a story together.

01:12:36.231 --> 01:12:39.526
Then maybe we'll talk about your friend.

01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:44.781
Go on.

01:13:12.476 --> 01:13:15.020
Ceci!

01:13:18.899 --> 01:13:21.485
Go away!

01:13:44.174 --> 01:13:46.510
- Where is she?
- She passed out in the bathroom.

01:13:46.593 --> 01:13:49.012
We don't know what happened.
There was water all over the place.

01:13:49.138 --> 01:13:50.681
- We took her to the hospital.
- Hospital?

01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:53.183
We just wanted to check her out.
It's school policy. We couldn't reach you.

01:13:53.308 --> 01:13:56.395
I had an emergency at work,
I didn't get my messages for two hours.

01:13:56.478 --> 01:13:58.772
We called her father
and he's gonna meet her at the hospital.

01:13:58.856 --> 01:14:02.442
- OK. Which hospital?
- It's the one right here on the island.

01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:05.237
Kyle took her.
They released her and he took her.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.782
- Did they say what was wrong?
- They said, you know, it's nothing serious.

01:14:08.866 --> 01:14:10.534
She fainted but...

01:14:10.617 --> 01:14:15.539
I'm trying to find him. I called his home
number, I called his cell phone number,

01:14:15.622 --> 01:14:18.125
I called his office number,
and he's avoiding me

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:20.919
so I need to know what to do.
Can I go to his apartment?

01:14:21.003 --> 01:14:23.881
Mrs. Williams, I need you to calm down.
I need it, your daughter needs it.

01:14:23.964 --> 01:14:25.215
Just calm down, OK?

01:14:25.299 --> 01:14:27.551
I'm sorry. I know you don't know me,
but you have to believe me.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.803
I'm not crazy, I'm really not.

01:14:29.887 --> 01:14:31.638
- I believe you, Mrs. Williams.
- I'm really not.

01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:35.642
Just go home. Your husband and your
daughter are probably waiting for you.

01:14:35.726 --> 01:14:38.937
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:14:40.147 --> 01:14:41.857
Ceci.

01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:45.152
Ceci.

01:14:48.822 --> 01:14:52.284
- No new messages.
- Oh, God.

01:14:53.577 --> 01:14:56.830
- Hello?
- Hello? It's Jeff. Are they there?

01:14:56.955 --> 01:14:57.956
- No.
- They're not there?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.085
No. There's no message.

01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:04.505
There's water everywhere.

01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:08.675
Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Williams, calm down.
Calm down.

01:15:08.759 --> 01:15:11.178
- She can't be here.
- What do you want me to do?

01:15:11.261 --> 01:15:13.263
Oh, God.

01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:17.434
I can't be her mother,
I don't know how to be myself.

01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:20.395
Ceci!

01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:32.199
I hate you.
Get away from me, you little bitch.

01:15:32.282 --> 01:15:34.451
I hate you.

01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:35.577
Fuck!

01:15:35.702 --> 01:15:39.122
I hate you! I hate you!

01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:41.250
Bitch!

01:15:51.802 --> 01:15:53.929
Sorry about this. I really had no idea.

01:15:54.054 --> 01:15:56.431
I would've come down myself
a long time ago.

01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:14.783
Better open it.

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:19.246
Hello?

01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:21.582
Hello?

01:16:25.335 --> 01:16:27.462
Jesus.

01:16:30.007 --> 01:16:33.802
Look at this. This is appalling.
This is appalling.

01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:38.098
The plumber's on his way. I'm paying him
double overtime so he can get here tonight.

01:16:38.182 --> 01:16:40.309
Hello?

01:16:42.436 --> 01:16:45.272
- I'll get some of these lights on.
- Mrs. Williams?

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:50.652
- You OK?
- I'm awake.

01:16:50.777 --> 01:16:53.155
The plumber will be here in 15 minutes.

01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:57.075
- Mr. Murray?
- This is just a big misunderstanding. OK?

01:16:57.201 --> 01:17:00.245
Mr. Veeck did not keep me informed.
This will be fixed tonight.

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:03.874
- Or she's staying at the Plaza, right?
- It will definitely be fixed tonight.

01:17:03.957 --> 01:17:06.793
- And I want to talk to Veeck.
- I will get him.

01:17:10.923 --> 01:17:13.008
You OK?

01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:16.762
- Migraine, huh?
- Yeah.

01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:23.811
- I'll keep my voice low.
- Thanks.

01:17:23.936 --> 01:17:26.605
I spoke with your husband's lawyer
and Ceci's fine.

01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:29.024
Kyle will bring her to school in the morning.

01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:30.734
OK.

01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:33.821
Now, this part is gonna piss you off.

01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:36.782
They want Ceci to see a psychologist
to be evaluated.

01:17:36.907 --> 01:17:42.621
There's nothing we can do about that
but say yes. So we're saying yes.

01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:45.082
OK.

01:17:46.917 --> 01:17:49.586
- Here we are.
- Mr. Veeck.

01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:51.755
I had an interesting conversation
with Mrs. Rimsky today.

01:17:51.839 --> 01:17:54.758
She was very surprised to hear
her daughter isn't living upstairs.

01:17:54.842 --> 01:17:57.469
- In 10F?
- Mm-hm.

01:17:57.594 --> 01:18:00.472
- You said they left together.
- That's what the Russian said.

01:18:00.597 --> 01:18:03.559
No, she left without her daughter.
She didn't think she could take care of her.

01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.103
Mrs. Rimsky's an alcoholic.
She claimed she was going for treatment,

01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:08.856
and had to leave the girl behind
with the father.

01:18:08.939 --> 01:18:11.150
You knew that, didn't you?

01:18:11.692 --> 01:18:14.695
Only Mr. Rimsky didn't take Natasha
with him.

01:18:14.778 --> 01:18:16.655
I spoke with Grandma Rimsky
in Moscow today

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.241
and she said her son
is living with her alone.

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:23.245
- So he lied to me. What do I know?
- You had to know.

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:27.958
Well, we'll find out tomorrow. I have
a phone appointment with Mr. Rimsky.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:32.379
- Why did you lie about the little girl?
- I didn't want to get involved, that's all.

01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:35.382
Did you see Natasha after her mother left?

01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:41.096
It's a simple question, Veeck.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:46.018
Yeah. I see her. I see her that afternoon.
I see her playing on the stairs.

01:18:46.143 --> 01:18:50.898
Then the next day the father tells me she
leave with the mother. I ask no questions.

01:18:51.023 --> 01:18:54.234
- Well, if he killed her, it's not my business.
- "Killed her"?

01:18:54.318 --> 01:18:56.904
"If he killed her"?

01:18:58.489 --> 01:19:00.282
Plumber!

01:19:00.407 --> 01:19:03.994
You got a lot more than a leak to fix,
Mr. Murray.

01:19:05.078 --> 01:19:07.122
Mr. Veeck.

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:13.295
- If you could just...
- Come on in, just right inside.

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.589
Thank you.

01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:18.759
Some kind of pipe or something.

01:19:18.842 --> 01:19:22.429
Yeah, well, see, that is a brand-new pipe.
So, this will all be patched tomorrow.

01:19:22.513 --> 01:19:25.307
- By professionals.
- By professionals. Good as new.

01:19:25.432 --> 01:19:30.312
It better be. I'm calling NYPD
to report a child is missing.

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:34.608
OK. I mean, I'm sure there's
a simple explanation for that, but...

01:19:34.691 --> 01:19:40.072
So, goodnight.
And, again, I am so sorry about all this.

01:19:41.949 --> 01:19:44.076
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:48.080
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

01:19:49.289 --> 01:19:53.836
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm feeling much better, actually.

01:19:53.961 --> 01:19:56.922
- I gotta go. Family.
- OK. Mm.

01:19:57.881 --> 01:20:01.927
I'll keep my cell on all night
and if you need me just call.

01:20:02.052 --> 01:20:04.263
- Any hour.
- Thanks.

01:20:05.305 --> 01:20:07.891
- Thanks again. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

01:20:20.154 --> 01:20:22.781
She left you behind.

01:20:24.241 --> 01:20:27.286
They both left you behind.

01:20:28.412 --> 01:20:29.538
Help me.

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.866
Wait!

01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:49.136
I told Murray, I told him a million times.

01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:52.723
It's not my job. I'm not a goddamn plumber.

01:23:01.273 --> 01:23:03.484
How you feeling? You OK?

01:23:03.567 --> 01:23:05.736
- You warmed up?
- I'm OK.

01:23:05.819 --> 01:23:10.491
Cops think Veeck probably
left the tank open and somehow she fell in.

01:23:10.616 --> 01:23:13.535
They even think he might have discovered
she'd fallen in weeks ago.

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:16.538
That's why he hadn't cleaned it in so long.

01:23:16.663 --> 01:23:18.999
They might have enough to charge him
with criminal negligence.

01:23:19.082 --> 01:23:24.338
They'd arrest the parents, but they're out
of state and there are no witnesses, so...

01:23:24.421 --> 01:23:29.134
The truth is, they'll probably
never know what happened.

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.930
Her mother left her.

01:23:34.264 --> 01:23:37.142
The father assumed
that she was with her mom,

01:23:38.185 --> 01:23:42.147
and the mother assumed
she was with her father.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.946
Guess everyone just assumed.

01:23:49.029 --> 01:23:51.824
No one really cared what happened to her.

01:23:51.907 --> 01:23:54.868
That's what it looks like.

01:23:58.622 --> 01:24:01.917
I'll tell Mary you've been a prince.

01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:04.002
You just accomplished the impossible,
Mrs. Williams.

01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:07.756
You actually made me glad
I went to law school.

01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:15.139
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:18.225
I can probably get you
a year's free rent out of Murray.

01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:21.186
Oh! No, it's OK.

01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:23.397
I'm moving.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.775
- Call me in the morning, OK?
- Yeah.

01:24:43.959 --> 01:24:45.961
- Come on, princess.
- Bye, Daddy.

01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:48.338
Bye.

01:24:57.347 --> 01:24:58.765
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

01:24:58.849 --> 01:25:01.101
Yeah?

01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:09.776
OK. I'll be here after school to pick you up.
See you after school.

01:25:14.781 --> 01:25:17.075
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:25:18.035 --> 01:25:20.454
Thank you for taking care
of Ceci yesterday.

01:25:20.537 --> 01:25:24.666
It's OK. I'm really worried
about her mental state.

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:27.169
- I am too.
- You are?

01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:29.129
Yeah.

01:25:29.213 --> 01:25:32.674
So, I've been thinking...

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.844
I don't want her
to have to choose between us.

01:25:35.969 --> 01:25:39.598
- What do you mean?
- I want to look for a place in Jersey City

01:25:39.723 --> 01:25:42.768
so that shared custody
will be easier for both of us.

01:25:42.893 --> 01:25:46.396
And we can do, you know,
one week with me, and one week with you.

01:25:46.522 --> 01:25:49.566
Or maybe split the week.
We can see what works best.

01:25:50.317 --> 01:25:54.947
- You serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:55.072 --> 01:25:59.660
Hey, you know, you were right about the
school here. I checked it out. It's good.

01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:02.871
- Maybe I could get a place...
- No, it's fine.

01:26:02.996 --> 01:26:07.417
After this, we'll get a...
a place in Jersey City.

01:26:14.508 --> 01:26:16.635
I'll see you later.

01:26:23.267 --> 01:26:26.311
- When are we moving?
- Not until next week, sweetheart.

01:26:26.436 --> 01:26:31.108
This is winter stuff though
so we can pack it up now.

01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:34.278
You OK? Are you feeling OK?

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:49.793
What are you thinking about?

01:26:49.877 --> 01:26:53.088
Why did her mommy forget about her?

01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:07.186
Do you know how much I love you?

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.066
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:17.112
- Do you know I would do anything for you?
- Yes.

01:27:18.322 --> 01:27:20.699
That's a promise.

01:27:20.824 --> 01:27:24.703
- Honey, do you want bubbles tonight?
- Uh-huh.

01:27:28.749 --> 01:27:29.958
There you are.

01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:35.047
- That's so great, Dahlia.
- Well, I think it's gonna be for the best.

01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:38.467
And moving out of here,
that is definitely for the best.

01:27:38.592 --> 01:27:42.513
What do you want to do? Be a chef? OK.

01:27:42.596 --> 01:27:45.808
Let's see if we can make you a chef hat.

01:27:48.936 --> 01:27:50.771
There.

01:27:50.854 --> 01:27:53.649
Now, what are you going to cook?

01:27:55.108 --> 01:27:56.944
Mac and cheese?

01:27:57.027 --> 01:28:00.322
Look, I should go get Ceci out of the tub
before she turns into a prune.

01:28:00.447 --> 01:28:02.783
- She's so cute.
- So... Oh!

01:28:02.866 --> 01:28:06.119
Here she is now.
Yeah. So I will talk to you tomorrow.

01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:07.663
- OK. Take care. Bye.
- OK. You too.

01:28:07.788 --> 01:28:08.997
Goodnight.

01:28:09.122 --> 01:28:13.544
- Mommy, can you read me a story?
- Course I can, honey.

01:28:18.549 --> 01:28:21.385
Let's see which one you picked.

01:28:33.564 --> 01:28:37.109
We haven't read this one
in a long time, have we?

01:28:39.069 --> 01:28:44.449
"There were once a man and a woman
who had long in vain wished for a child. "

01:28:44.575 --> 01:28:47.369
We need more snow, don't you think?

01:28:48.412 --> 01:28:50.914
Then let's get some more snow.

01:28:55.586 --> 01:28:58.630
...beautiful Rapunzel.

01:29:11.268 --> 01:29:15.022
Don't leave me.
I want you to be my mommy.

01:29:15.105 --> 01:29:17.691
- Don't leave me.
- Ceci!

01:29:17.774 --> 01:29:20.319
You can't leave me.

01:29:23.113 --> 01:29:25.073
Ceci!

01:29:25.282 --> 01:29:27.284
Ceci!

01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:29.077
Ceci!

01:29:29.286 --> 01:29:31.121
Ceci!

01:29:33.874 --> 01:29:36.043
Ceci!

01:29:37.503 --> 01:29:39.296
No!

01:29:40.714 --> 01:29:42.674
Ceci!

01:29:48.931 --> 01:29:51.058
Ceci!

01:29:51.225 --> 01:29:52.392
Ceci!

01:29:53.727 --> 01:29:55.729
Oh, God.

01:29:55.813 --> 01:29:59.149
Let her go! You let her go!

01:30:04.613 --> 01:30:06.240
No!

01:30:21.588 --> 01:30:23.924
No! Please!

01:30:24.007 --> 01:30:27.719
Natasha! Let her go! Please.

01:30:28.762 --> 01:30:31.598
We'll stay. We'll stay here with you.

01:30:33.684 --> 01:30:36.478
What do you want?

01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:40.315
I'll be your mother.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.651
- Please.
- Forever?

01:30:45.279 --> 01:30:47.781
Forever.

01:30:47.906 --> 01:30:50.033
Forever. Yes.

01:30:50.117 --> 01:30:53.412
I'll be your mother forever.

01:30:53.537 --> 01:30:56.498
Take me. Please, take me.

01:32:00.604 --> 01:32:05.651
Yeah, OK. So we got an 11-46,
Caucasian female, aged 30,

01:32:05.776 --> 01:32:09.154
no apparent cause of death,
and a six-year-old girl with shock.

01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:11.281
Trying to locate the father.

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.587
Ceci.

01:33:04.418 --> 01:33:09.047
Let's go home, honey.
Would you get the door?

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:54.259
We did a whole bunch of them.
A whole neighborhood.

01:33:54.384 --> 01:33:56.887
What was this one about?
Do you remember?

01:33:56.970 --> 01:34:00.057
That was me and then that was you.

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.602
- That was a tree.
- A tree.

01:34:03.727 --> 01:34:09.691
- And then that's a little angel.
- Beautiful gold wings on the angel.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.842
Come on.

01:34:37.094 --> 01:34:39.596
OK, honey, let's walk.

01:34:41.932 --> 01:34:44.643
What's wrong with you?

01:34:49.022 --> 01:34:51.191
Come on.

01:34:55.612 --> 01:34:56.780
Ceci.

01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:58.490
Ceci?

01:34:58.782 --> 01:34:59.700
Ceci?

01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:02.119
Open the door.
Push the button, Ceci.

01:35:02.202 --> 01:35:05.080
Open it. Open the door. Ceci!

01:35:34.318 --> 01:35:36.653
My beautiful girl.

01:35:48.248 --> 01:35:50.834
Whenever you need me, I'm here.

01:35:54.338 --> 01:35:57.174
OK, Daddy. Let's go.
