00:24.608 --> 00:26.986
16's coming through to set up the UAV.

00:29.947 --> 00:34.910
It appears this city's inhabitants lost a
great battle and were destroyed long ago.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.079
There appear to be no survivors.

00:37.204 --> 00:42.376
That's too bad. I was hoping someone
could help me decipher this language.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.504
- No idea?
- No, and it's very odd.

00:45.629 --> 00:49.258
This, uh... whatever this is,
is a completely different design

00:49.383 --> 00:51.427
than the rest of the civilisation.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.804
Maybe it was here when they got here.

00:54.096 --> 00:58.225
That's assuming the inhabitants
were foreign to the planet.

00:58.309 --> 01:03.481
I can probably date its construction
using some sort of carbon analysis.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.150
How long?

01:06.275 --> 01:10.488
- For what?
- All of it. How long?

01:12.239 --> 01:14.283
Uh, well, days, weeks, months maybe,

01:14.408 --> 01:18.704
of meticulous, tedious,
boring tediousness.

01:23.751 --> 01:27.296
I can just keep working now.
By lunch, at least.

01:32.176 --> 01:35.763
Carter! Any idea what this thing is yet?

01:35.888 --> 01:38.265
No, sir, but the technology's
very advanced.

01:38.391 --> 01:40.935
So, what? Two hours?

01:41.644 --> 01:43.521
Very advanced.

01:46.399 --> 01:49.819
Teal'c and I have secured the area.
We're gonna check out the town.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.987
Yes, sir.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.491
Don't turn it on.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.867
(O'Neill) Ah!

01:57.660 --> 02:01.330
- What'd I just say?
- I know.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.092
Hey, Sam, are you done
with that camera yet?

02:56.635 --> 02:58.679
Sam?

03:13.361 --> 03:15.654
Jack, get back here. Now!

04:23.431 --> 04:26.767
Then I'm waking up with
Colonel O'Neill looking down at me.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.729
It's possible I touched
something inside the device.

04:29.812 --> 04:32.815
- No contact burns.
- So what do you think it was?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.609
People have been known
to black out from fatigue.

04:35.735 --> 04:38.112
Come on, Janet. I was a little tired, but...

04:38.320 --> 04:41.157
Your pre-mission blood test
did show slight anaemia.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.492
You gave me clearance to go.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.871
And I'm starting
to question that judgment.

04:46.996 --> 04:49.665
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- OK.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.626
Consider what you've
been through the last few years.

04:52.710 --> 04:56.172
A Tok'ra symbiote died in your brain,
your memory was stamped

04:56.297 --> 04:59.383
and your consciousness
was transferred into a computer

04:59.508 --> 05:03.387
and back into your body,
and that is just for starters.

05:03.596 --> 05:06.140
Eventually it has to take its toll.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.601
- Are we done?
- Yes.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.023
Make sure you come back if you
start speaking an alien language.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.192
I'm sure I'll have no choice.

05:17.526 --> 05:23.199
The structure was built 400 years ago,
but the civilisation may date back 3,000.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.326
Why is that significant?

05:25.451 --> 05:29.121
The society may have developed
in isolation, and was later influenced

05:29.246 --> 05:33.709
by something that suddenly led it
to leap to a more advanced technology.

05:33.793 --> 05:35.836
- A Stargate.
- Exactly.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.005
It's likely they either discovered it,

05:38.130 --> 05:41.217
or figured out how to use it
just before building the device.

05:41.300 --> 05:45.346
It seems that these events led to
the cataclysm which ended their society.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.556
Somehow.

05:47.682 --> 05:51.894
Goa'ulds often attack a planet that
threatens technological advancement.

05:51.977 --> 05:55.690
I'm sorry, but I haven't heard
anyone say exactly what the device is.

05:55.815 --> 06:00.736
We're still just speculating. It could be
a deep space observatory for all I know.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.948
Or a big, honkin' space gun, sir.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.620
Most likely the Goa'uld
would have taken that.

06:11.664 --> 06:14.750
Whatever it is, the power core is missing.

06:16.752 --> 06:19.338
I was able to determine
that much before l...

06:19.463 --> 06:21.507
Dozed off?

06:23.175 --> 06:27.471
The engineering is extremely advanced.
It's gonna take some time to decipher.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.933
You're saying that the power core
to the device is missing?

06:31.058 --> 06:34.979
- Major, you know Colonel Reynolds.
- Of course.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.148
He's been transferred from Area 51

06:37.273 --> 06:42.361
and will be leading SG-16 during
its long-term analysis of the planet.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.989
Ah.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.907
Well, as I was saying, uh,

06:46.991 --> 06:50.703
I believe that a naqahdah generator
could be modified to interface...

06:50.828 --> 06:52.955
Carter.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.085
16 is on the case.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.716
Once I've heard someone
conclusively tell me what the device is,

07:03.841 --> 07:07.386
I will decide whether we should
try and find a way to turn it on.

07:07.553 --> 07:11.766
Of course. Request permission
to join SG-16's assignment, sir.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.142
Denied.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.645
Dr Jackson will assist in
the translation of the alien language

07:16.771 --> 07:19.190
until SG-1's next mission.

07:19.315 --> 07:21.901
Otherwise, you're all free
to take some time off.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.736
Dismissed.

07:27.323 --> 07:29.200
Sir.

07:29.283 --> 07:33.954
With all due respect, I feel fine. There's
absolutely no reason why I shouldn't help.

07:34.080 --> 07:39.752
I have no doubt that your technical
expertise will be required at some point,

07:39.877 --> 07:44.590
but until Dr Fraiser advises otherwise,
I'm ordering you to take it easy.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.637
- "Take it easy"?
- Yeah.

07:49.762 --> 07:53.474
- You've been a little tense.
- "Tense"? Me? I'm not tense.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.894
Am l?

07:58.938 --> 08:02.692
- When did you first notice?
- As we met.

08:04.610 --> 08:07.071
I've always thought
of myself as very focused.

08:07.196 --> 08:10.950
It's called "working too hard".
You're gonna crash and burn.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.786
I don't have that much else to do, sir.

08:13.911 --> 08:17.873
Well, find something. Take up... golf.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.336
Fly a kite. Knit something.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.552
I'm... I'm fine.

08:30.386 --> 08:31.387
Really.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.630
(voicemail) You have no new messages.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.115
Hi.

10:15.491 --> 10:17.368
Hi.

10:19.412 --> 10:21.288
How are you?

10:23.040 --> 10:26.961
- Fine. How are you?
- Good.

10:27.086 --> 10:29.130
Nice to meet you.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.342
Yeah... Are you from around here?

10:33.759 --> 10:37.555
No. But this is where you live.

10:40.474 --> 10:45.021
Yes, it is. I'm gonna go back inside now.

10:45.563 --> 10:47.565
See you again.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.359
Bye.

11:24.352 --> 11:26.395
(phone ringing)

11:35.696 --> 11:38.240
- Daniel Jackson.
- Hey, Daniel, it's me.

11:38.366 --> 11:39.658
Hi, Sam.

11:39.784 --> 11:43.746
I was just wondering how far
you've gotten on the 636 translation.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.624
Oh, yes. Um, yeah, I'm almost done.

11:46.749 --> 11:52.088
It miraculously seems to hold the key
to all the mysteries of the universe.

11:52.713 --> 11:57.510
You just got there, you haven't started
and I should leave you alone.

11:57.635 --> 12:01.681
- You were supposed to be taking it easy.
- Yeah. It's not so easy.

12:01.764 --> 12:05.267
Yeah, I know. I promise
I'll call you when I have something.

12:05.393 --> 12:07.436
OK. Thanks.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.816
(gasps)

12:11.899 --> 12:14.485
- How did you get in here?
- I won't hurt you.

12:14.819 --> 12:16.904
No, I'll hurt you if you come any closer.

12:17.029 --> 12:20.116
Please don't. I just wanna talk to you.

12:20.449 --> 12:24.120
- About what?
- It's complicated.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.789
Let's start with
how you got into my house.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.084
- I followed you home last night.
- You've been here all night?

12:30.209 --> 12:35.297
I read your books and watched television,
to learn how to speak and what to wear.

12:36.215 --> 12:40.511
- Is this OK?
- You've been in my house all night?

12:40.720 --> 12:43.889
Yes. But you couldn't see me.

12:43.973 --> 12:47.309
I just took this form now
so we could relate.

12:47.393 --> 12:50.563
Actually, I used to look this way,
before my ascension.

12:52.148 --> 12:54.191
(dials number)

12:55.568 --> 12:58.946
Please. I'm not crazy.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.909
- Who are you?
- My name is Orlin.

13:04.035 --> 13:06.203
I'm from the planet you just visited.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.665
- I followed you through the Stargate.
- That's impossible.

13:09.832 --> 13:14.211
I can become invisible
in my natural noncorporeal state.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.339
What do you want?

13:16.464 --> 13:19.800
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I just wanted to talk to you.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.137
It's been so long since l... I...

13:24.638 --> 13:26.682
I know this is going to seem...

13:28.768 --> 13:32.396
OK. I'll just come out and say it,
and we'll move on from there.

13:32.521 --> 13:37.735
I have these... I guess you could
call them "feelings"... for you.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.987
Actually, the truth is l...

13:41.947 --> 13:43.991
Iove you.

13:45.785 --> 13:47.036
(door closes)

13:53.584 --> 13:57.004
- Looked like an ordinary guy?
- Pretty much.

13:57.129 --> 14:00.549
- What was he wearing?
- Average, normal clothes.

14:02.593 --> 14:04.637
Where do you think he got 'em?

14:05.596 --> 14:08.516
Come on, sir.
We've seen lots of aliens before.

14:08.766 --> 14:12.812
Hammond had the surveillance tapes
in the gate room checked.

14:13.187 --> 14:16.774
The alien said he could
become completely invisible.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.902
What else did he say?

14:21.487 --> 14:24.240
He just said who he was
and where he was from.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.536
Believe me, at first I thought
he was some crazy guy off the street.

14:28.661 --> 14:31.914
Then he starts walking
through solid objects!

14:31.997 --> 14:35.251
I knew there was no way I would
be able to contain him if I tried.

14:35.376 --> 14:37.878
My phone was dead.
I decided the best thing to do

14:38.004 --> 14:41.090
would be to bring a code-three team in
as fast as possible.

14:41.173 --> 14:45.302
Carter, no one's accusing
you of acting improperly.

14:46.303 --> 14:49.890
Colonel, we're done. I'm ordering
my men to evacuate the premises.

14:50.016 --> 14:53.269
Notify the local authorities.
Tell 'em the gas leak is fixed.

14:53.352 --> 14:57.565
Yes, sir. Our remote surveillance system
can be monitored from a van outside.

14:57.690 --> 15:01.193
- We'll watch as long as you want, sir.
- Thanks.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.996
I could hang out for a while.

15:12.121 --> 15:14.331
So far he's only shown himself to me.

15:15.041 --> 15:18.044
Maybe he's shy.

15:19.170 --> 15:22.006
Please don't say "Take it easy".

15:22.089 --> 15:24.300
Take care.

16:01.462 --> 16:03.506
How's Sam?

16:04.465 --> 16:08.177
Absolutely no evidence
of her "secret friend".

16:09.887 --> 16:11.681
How's Sam?

16:12.932 --> 16:16.560
Hammond recommended
a psych evaluation.

16:16.686 --> 16:19.939
Do you believe Major Carter
has become mentally unstable?

16:20.022 --> 16:23.109
No more than the rest of us.

16:26.487 --> 16:30.074
- What do you guys got?
- Looks like that thing on 636 is a weapon.

16:30.783 --> 16:33.869
- I was right?
- It is a weapon of great power, O'Neill.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.996
Big and honkin'?

16:36.080 --> 16:38.624
From what I can decipher,
the people on 636

16:38.749 --> 16:41.836
had a similar technological
timeline to Earth.

16:41.961 --> 16:46.173
They had just discovered their Stargate
when "the threat from the skies" came.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.550
Goa'ulds.

16:47.675 --> 16:52.763
Yet they managed to build an incredibly
advanced weapon to defend themselves.

16:53.431 --> 16:56.517
Couldn't have been so advanced.

16:57.226 --> 17:00.312
The place was a disaster.
It obviously didn't work.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.899
Actually, it did.
The monument outside the device

17:03.983 --> 17:06.902
tells how they destroyed
the "threat from the skies",

17:06.986 --> 17:09.280
and the men who built
the weapon were heroes.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.781
So the Goa'uld did not take the weapon.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.617
Hey, I saw that planet.

17:14.743 --> 17:17.079
If the Goa'uld didn't get 'em, who did?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.836
We're not sure.

17:28.257 --> 17:30.509
I understand why you did it.

17:32.178 --> 17:35.264
Of course, you would wait
until they took the cameras away.

17:35.348 --> 17:37.308
Military protocol.

17:37.391 --> 17:40.561
You would have jeopardised your job
if you didn't report me.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.105
I just came from
a psychological evaluation.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.692
- Do you understand what that means?
- They think you're crazy.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.402
Am l?

17:48.527 --> 17:51.906
There were times on Velona where
I thought I was losing my mind.

17:52.031 --> 17:55.368
- Velona?
- Your planet refers to it as 636.

17:56.577 --> 18:00.498
I was there for hundreds of years
by myself. The first time I saw you...

18:00.623 --> 18:03.167
- Look...
- Please. Let me finish.

18:06.504 --> 18:10.800
My kind attain a level of communication
that shares our innermost essence.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.177
Telepathy.

18:14.178 --> 18:17.765
Reading someone's mind
is an invasion of privacy.

18:17.890 --> 18:21.227
It's not about specific
thoughts or memory.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.689
It's a sort of exchange of spirit.

18:26.524 --> 18:31.153
- So you did this sharing thing on me?
- Unfortunately you passed out.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.322
I guess you weren't prepared.

18:34.657 --> 18:37.201
But I did learn about you.

18:37.326 --> 18:40.496
- What did you learn?
- That you're a good person.

18:41.122 --> 18:43.874
That your heart is pure.

18:44.208 --> 18:47.962
That on the inside, your spirit is as
beautiful as you are on the outside.

18:48.087 --> 18:49.630
All right!

18:49.714 --> 18:53.050
- Where are you going?
- To get the code-three team back in here.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.928
- I'll just hide again.
- So what are you gonna do?

18:56.053 --> 18:58.180
Stalk me for the rest of my life?

18:58.305 --> 19:01.225
I just wanted you to let me try again.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.311
I think a human can handle it.

19:04.437 --> 19:06.689
I think you have to just be...

19:06.814 --> 19:09.025
well... receptive.

19:13.904 --> 19:16.991
Then will you go to the SGC
and turn yourself in?

19:17.074 --> 19:20.244
No. But I'll leave, if you want.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.205
Will you actually be gone?

19:24.415 --> 19:26.500
I promise.

19:31.130 --> 19:33.799
OK. What do I do?

19:37.803 --> 19:39.847
Stand there.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.854
Open your mind to
the possibility of an existence

19:46.979 --> 19:50.399
not governed by the rules of science
which you hold so dear.

19:50.524 --> 19:53.027
How do I do that?

19:53.152 --> 19:56.238
- Just close your eyes and...
- Don't say "Take it easy".

19:56.614 --> 19:58.324
Relax.

20:26.602 --> 20:28.646
Oh, my God.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.737
- Colonel!
- Yeah.

20:36.862 --> 20:39.156
Sir. Look at this.

20:40.950 --> 20:44.537
- So?
- So, it was in my house.

20:44.662 --> 20:47.998
The code-three team was supposed
to take away their equipment.

20:48.124 --> 20:51.502
- No more cameras or listening devices.
- So they forgot one.

20:51.627 --> 20:53.421
- Are you sure?
- No.

20:53.504 --> 20:57.466
Sir, is the SGC secretly
keeping tabs on me?

20:59.010 --> 21:00.720
Secretly?

21:00.803 --> 21:03.222
I did my duty in reporting
the alien encounter,

21:03.347 --> 21:05.558
and now everyone thinks I'm crazy.

21:08.269 --> 21:11.605
Look, here's the bottom line.
No one is seeing what you've seen.

21:11.689 --> 21:15.151
Until that happens,
we're all gonna think you're nuts.

21:16.152 --> 21:17.778
Sir.

21:17.862 --> 21:21.365
Purely hypothetically,
as my superior officer,

21:21.490 --> 21:24.076
if this alien did show
himself to me again...

21:24.243 --> 21:26.120
Did it?

21:26.245 --> 21:32.251
I'm just saying, ifthe alien had the ability
and desire to show himself only to me,

21:32.376 --> 21:35.046
it would be better
if I gathered information,

21:35.129 --> 21:37.590
possibly even found a way of isolating it,

21:38.299 --> 21:42.178
before I officially
mentioned it again, right?

21:45.139 --> 21:48.392
Probably... yes.

21:50.519 --> 21:52.563
- I gotta pee.
- Yes, sir.

22:05.910 --> 22:07.953
- That's the last of it.
- Thanks.

22:09.038 --> 22:10.915
Whatcha working on?

22:11.248 --> 22:15.544
Well, based on your translation,
and SG-16's latest report,

22:15.628 --> 22:20.383
the Pentagon is urging General Hammond
to find a way to activate the weapon.

22:22.176 --> 22:24.637
- You think that's gonna be possible?
- Yeah.

22:24.762 --> 22:27.598
The naqahdah reactor
can be interfaced easily.

22:27.682 --> 22:31.602
The problem is, the burst of energy
required makes it all pretty dangerous.

22:31.769 --> 22:33.562
How?

22:33.646 --> 22:38.275
Well, you have to start an overload in
the reactor, then release it into the device.

22:38.401 --> 22:40.444
But once the overload is started,

22:40.569 --> 22:43.823
you have to release the energy,
or the reactor will explode.

22:43.948 --> 22:46.617
So you better be sure
you want the weapon to fire.

22:46.909 --> 22:50.496
Yeah. I'm working on a way to buffer
the energy in a safer environment

22:50.621 --> 22:54.417
prior to the release, but General
Hammond hasn't given me much time.

22:54.542 --> 22:59.380
By all accounts, this device on 636
is a pretty powerful weapon.

22:59.964 --> 23:03.843
- You think we should just leave it alone?
- Let's say I'd feel a lot better

23:03.968 --> 23:08.764
if there was someone left
to explain exactly how to use it.

23:15.354 --> 23:17.648
You're late.

23:17.773 --> 23:21.110
- What do you mean?
- You said you'd be home an hour ago.

23:21.235 --> 23:23.654
I was worried.

23:24.196 --> 23:27.700
Hey, this is not a relationship
we have going here.

23:27.825 --> 23:31.954
- I don't even know what it is.
- You still could have called.

23:32.288 --> 23:35.750
What are you talking about?
You couldn't have answered the phone.

23:35.875 --> 23:38.336
Maybe I could have.

23:40.963 --> 23:42.506
How...

23:42.590 --> 23:44.633
I mean, l... I...

23:52.933 --> 23:56.354
- Surprise.
- How?

23:56.687 --> 23:59.523
Things have been going well
between us. Right?

24:02.526 --> 24:07.073
There is no "us", Orlin.
I don't see how there ever could be.

24:07.865 --> 24:12.161
That's just because we both used
to live on different planes of existence.

24:12.495 --> 24:16.207
- "Used to"?
- My kind are able to take human form.

24:17.124 --> 24:21.170
Actually, retake human form,
considering that's the way we started.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.546
(doorbell)

24:22.672 --> 24:24.548
Oh, boy. Uh...

24:24.674 --> 24:27.677
- (O'Neill) Carter!
- It's Colonel O'Neill.

24:27.802 --> 24:29.261
Disappear!

24:29.428 --> 24:32.598
That's what I was trying to tell you.
I can't any more.

24:33.766 --> 24:35.059
(knock at door)

24:43.484 --> 24:45.820
Hey, guys. What are you doing here?

24:45.945 --> 24:48.614
- We brought pizza and a movie.
- Star Wars.

24:48.698 --> 24:50.574
- He's seen it eight times.
- Nine.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.576
Nine times.

24:52.660 --> 24:55.329
If Teal'c likes it, it's gotta be OK.

24:56.956 --> 25:00.876
- You've never seen Star Wars?
- You know me and sci-fi.

25:01.836 --> 25:04.422
Come on, we never get
to just hang out so...

25:04.547 --> 25:06.882
Well, sir, as much as l, uh...

25:07.633 --> 25:09.593
Uh...

25:09.719 --> 25:11.762
Carter,

25:13.097 --> 25:16.100
do you already have company?

25:17.226 --> 25:20.312
- Kind of.
- A date?

25:20.479 --> 25:24.942
I can understand why you might
assume that I didn't have plans.

25:25.067 --> 25:27.111
Don't worry about it.

25:29.155 --> 25:31.115
We'll find something else to do.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.869
I'm really sorry.
This was a surprise. Very unexpected.

25:35.202 --> 25:37.455
Good for you.

25:37.580 --> 25:40.082
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

25:40.207 --> 25:42.793
Have a pizza. And fun.

25:45.004 --> 25:46.088
Night.

25:58.559 --> 26:01.479
As I was saying, once my kind
chooses to take human form,

26:01.562 --> 26:04.940
we can't ascend again
without the help of the others.

26:07.401 --> 26:09.779
So... now what?

26:10.946 --> 26:15.159
I have read of a place where humans
do battle in a ring of Jell-O.

26:15.284 --> 26:17.328
Call Daniel.

26:40.226 --> 26:42.353
I don't know where
the rest of my kind are.

26:42.478 --> 26:44.897
Believe it or not,
I think we met one of them.

26:45.022 --> 26:47.066
Her name was Oma Desala.

26:47.858 --> 26:50.528
Really? Never heard of her.

26:51.570 --> 26:54.407
She could do the same glowy
kinda things that you can.

26:54.490 --> 26:56.701
And she controlled the forces of nature.

26:56.826 --> 26:58.786
Yeah. That's easy.

26:58.911 --> 27:00.955
At least, it used to be.

27:03.374 --> 27:05.835
She lived on a planet called Kheb

27:05.960 --> 27:09.338
and she helped people ascend
to a higher plane of existence.

27:09.463 --> 27:11.507
That's why I've never heard of her.

27:11.632 --> 27:14.552
She was probably banished, like me.

27:16.053 --> 27:17.763
What for?

27:17.847 --> 27:20.599
Breaking one of the most
sacred rules of our kind.

27:20.725 --> 27:24.854
Do not accelerate the natural ascension
process of those beneath.

27:25.396 --> 27:28.315
The humans of Velona were
under attack from the Goa'uld.

27:28.441 --> 27:32.319
I was prohibited from interfering,
but I couldn't just watch them die.

27:32.653 --> 27:35.573
You told them how to build the weapon?

27:35.656 --> 27:39.535
Communicated the knowledge, yes.
They saved themselves.

27:39.827 --> 27:42.580
But not for long.

27:42.663 --> 27:43.706
No.

27:45.124 --> 27:47.585
Well, you were right to try.

27:48.336 --> 27:51.422
You're wrong. It was a horrible mistake.

27:52.006 --> 27:54.091
After they used the weapon for defence,

27:54.216 --> 27:58.346
they planned the conquest of other
planets using the technology I gave them.

27:58.429 --> 28:01.015
So what happened?

28:01.140 --> 28:03.184
The others.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.937
The others of your kind
destroyed the planet?

28:08.105 --> 28:12.234
Well, they interfered, too.
Isn't that breaking their own rule?

28:12.860 --> 28:14.904
They decided it was necessary

28:15.029 --> 28:18.199
to prevent a disaster
that I was responsible for.

28:18.282 --> 28:21.035
I was forced to live on Velona
as my punishment.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.705
- You couldn't have known.
- That's why the rule exists.

28:27.917 --> 28:29.960
So...

28:31.045 --> 28:32.755
what now?

28:33.172 --> 28:35.216
I'm human.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.635
Mortal. Like you.

28:39.387 --> 28:42.848
I can never go back to the way
I was without the others.

28:44.433 --> 28:46.894
Why would you do this?

28:48.229 --> 28:50.648
I did it as much for myself as for you.

28:54.235 --> 28:58.072
(Orlin) lfnothing develops
between us, I'll accept it.

29:00.157 --> 29:02.368
Ijust couldn't go on any other way.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.204
Ijust had to know.

29:08.833 --> 29:13.045
One week should be more than enough
time to run the proper pre-test simulation.

29:13.170 --> 29:16.841
Sirs, if I may, I think we should wait.

29:17.425 --> 29:20.678
You think we should wait?
You're the one who figured out

29:20.803 --> 29:23.723
how to use the naqahdah reactor
to power this device.

29:23.806 --> 29:27.351
Because General Hammond
ordered me to.

29:27.685 --> 29:32.064
If you read my recommendations, you'll
see I also said it's extremely dangerous.

29:32.148 --> 29:34.150
I did read your recommendation

29:34.275 --> 29:37.820
and the Pentagon feels
that the risks are worth the reward.

29:37.945 --> 29:41.782
Going through the Stargate is dangerous
and you do that every day.

29:41.907 --> 29:44.994
I agree with Sam. We don't know
enough about what happened.

29:45.119 --> 29:49.999
Need I remind you of the dangers that
we're trying to defend Earth against?

29:50.458 --> 29:52.918
Oh, could you? I mean, go slow.

29:53.919 --> 29:59.675
General, I believe that using the device
caused an atmospheric weather anomaly

29:59.800 --> 30:03.054
big enough to destroy
the civilisation on 636.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.184
You do?

30:10.269 --> 30:14.023
- That wasn't in your report.
- Do you have any evidence, Major?

30:15.191 --> 30:16.901
Well, not exactly.

30:16.984 --> 30:21.364
But I think that we need to perform
a forensic environmental analysis.

30:21.489 --> 30:23.949
We're going to,
after test-firing the weapon.

30:24.075 --> 30:27.161
That's when we'll be able
to gather accurate information.

30:27.286 --> 30:29.789
- Not if you're dead.
- There is nothing to show...

30:29.914 --> 30:33.751
Major, you have two weeks
to bring me any relevant evidence.

30:33.876 --> 30:37.421
If you can present a good reason
to stop the test, I will.

30:40.049 --> 30:42.093
Dismissed.

30:42.218 --> 30:44.261
General.

30:47.682 --> 30:52.687
Need I remind you that, ultimately,
the decision rests with the Pentagon?

30:54.313 --> 30:59.443
Colonel, there's a red phone in my office
that only takes calls from one man.

30:59.568 --> 31:04.281
The last time I checked, he's the boss of
your boss, or do I need to remind you?

31:18.713 --> 31:20.756
Orlin?

31:23.009 --> 31:24.719
Sam.

31:24.802 --> 31:28.055
I'm glad you're home.
I made something for you.

31:36.355 --> 31:38.315
Is this real?

31:38.441 --> 31:42.403
I read about how humans associate
certain materials with their birth month.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.989
Yours is emerald, right?

31:45.114 --> 31:47.950
- It's huge.
- Oh. Is it?

31:48.075 --> 31:52.371
It was difficult to tell the common size
from the pictures in the book.

31:52.496 --> 31:53.622
You made it?

31:53.748 --> 31:59.086
You wouldn't believe what you can make
from the simple items lying around Earth.

31:59.253 --> 32:03.215
Which reminds me,
you're going to need a new microwave.

32:04.091 --> 32:07.595
Orlin, I need to talk
to you about something else.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.764
OK.

32:11.557 --> 32:13.100
Let's take a walk.

32:14.185 --> 32:16.854
The others will know
if the weapon is activated.

32:16.937 --> 32:20.399
- You think they'll try to stop us?
- It's possible.

32:20.524 --> 32:23.944
Even if we only intend to use
the weapon to defend ourselves?

32:24.070 --> 32:26.989
How can you be sure
of your people's intentions?

32:27.114 --> 32:31.160
You obviously can't trust them if you think
they would spy on you in your home.

32:31.285 --> 32:33.704
Yeah, I guess I can't trust all of them.

32:34.872 --> 32:37.792
- I've read some of your recent history.
- And?

32:38.584 --> 32:41.003
Many of the creators
of the first atom bomb

32:41.128 --> 32:45.174
honestly believed that it would
only be used to maintain peace.

32:45.299 --> 32:48.135
I can't take the chance, Sam.

32:48.260 --> 32:52.640
I won't be responsible
for the demise of another civilisation.

32:52.765 --> 32:56.435
If you thought it might come to that,
why didn't you destroy the weapon?

32:56.560 --> 33:01.190
I thought I had. I never expected
you'd be able to replace the power core.

33:02.942 --> 33:04.985
You really are brilliant.

33:05.986 --> 33:09.365
I think your point is,
we have to find a way to stop the test.

33:09.490 --> 33:13.077
How? You have no proof
without exposing me.

33:13.202 --> 33:15.246
I know.

33:16.288 --> 33:18.666
What?

33:18.791 --> 33:23.337
I'm sorry. If you haven't turned
me in by now, there must be a reason.

33:23.462 --> 33:26.882
I'd feel bad betraying you.
That's all. Nothing more.

33:27.008 --> 33:29.093
- You like me.
- Orlin.

33:30.511 --> 33:32.972
You like me. I can tell.

33:34.265 --> 33:36.308
You like me a lot.

33:56.662 --> 33:58.706
They're testing the weapon.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.626
I received an order from the president.

34:02.752 --> 34:06.505
Colonel Reynolds and SG-16
are on P4X-636,

34:06.630 --> 34:09.632
setting up the naqahdah reactor
as we speak.

34:09.967 --> 34:12.261
You said I had two weeks. It's only been...

34:12.386 --> 34:14.972
Nine days, Major.

34:15.097 --> 34:17.933
And I dare say you haven't
spent a single minute of it

34:18.059 --> 34:20.518
working on atmospheric
weather anomalies.

34:20.770 --> 34:23.606
What's that supposed to mean?

34:23.731 --> 34:26.984
Would you like
to explain these deliveries?

34:28.110 --> 34:31.697
- What deliveries?
- 100lbs of pure, raw titanium,

34:32.572 --> 34:35.034
200 feet of fibreoptic cable,

34:35.159 --> 34:40.664
seven 100,000-watt
industrial-strength capacitors.

34:40.915 --> 34:45.293
The list goes on. All ordered
online from your home computer.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.174
I've no idea what you mean.
I've been on the base every day.

34:50.299 --> 34:55.304
Oh. Then maybe you would like to explain
who's been accepting these deliveries?

35:00.893 --> 35:03.104
You have been watching me.

35:04.605 --> 35:07.608
Not us. The Pentagon.

35:07.692 --> 35:11.904
I'm sorry, Major. I've expressed my anger
and disappointment to the president

35:12.029 --> 35:16.492
regarding the investigation of
one of my officers without my knowledge.

35:16.575 --> 35:19.328
We have tapes of
your conversation with the alien.

35:22.456 --> 35:26.919
At least we know
there is one now, for sure.

35:29.463 --> 35:33.300
Would you like to tell us
what's going on, Major?

35:33.426 --> 35:35.469
She doesn't have to tell you squat.

35:36.721 --> 35:40.766
Major Carter was working with
the approval of her superior officer.

35:40.891 --> 35:42.935
She told me he was there.

35:43.060 --> 35:46.480
I authorised her to collect
as much information as possible.

35:46.605 --> 35:50.276
I'm not here to lay blame, Colonel.
I'm here as a courtesy.

35:50.401 --> 35:54.613
As we speak, a team of Special Forces
are surrounding your house.

35:55.364 --> 35:57.742
And on my command, they're gonna go in

35:58.743 --> 36:01.162
and take that alien into custody.

36:24.977 --> 36:25.978
What's going on?

36:26.103 --> 36:31.150
The suspect is in there, but he's failing
to respond to our call to surrender.

36:31.275 --> 36:35.821
Let Carter go in.
He's worth more to you alive, right?

36:36.197 --> 36:37.198
(man) Yeah.

36:37.323 --> 36:41.243
(O'Neill) You got the place sealed off.
He's not going anywhere.

36:41.369 --> 36:43.496
Let Carter go in and try and bring him out.

36:43.621 --> 36:45.664
All right. Give her a radio.

36:58.803 --> 37:00.846
Orlin?

37:05.059 --> 37:08.562
- Orlin!
- (Orlin) Sam. Come on down.

37:10.898 --> 37:14.360
- Orlin, what are you doing?
- (Orlin) OK. Just a minute.

37:14.485 --> 37:17.571
- A team of Special Forces is outside.
- I know.

37:17.655 --> 37:20.825
- They wanna take you into custody.
- I know. It's OK.

37:20.908 --> 37:23.369
Orlin, I didn't turn you in.

37:23.494 --> 37:25.538
I didn't think you did.

37:28.708 --> 37:30.751
Come on.

37:37.216 --> 37:38.926
Whoa!

37:39.051 --> 37:41.012
You've been busy.

37:41.095 --> 37:45.474
I didn't think they'd let me go back
to Velona through their Stargate.

37:45.558 --> 37:48.477
- So you built one?
- Sort of.

37:49.311 --> 37:54.025
This won't dial multiple addresses. It only
creates a wormhole once, then burns out.

37:54.150 --> 37:57.153
And you ordered the materials online?

37:57.778 --> 38:02.408
Mostly. Sorry, but you're gonna have
a pretty big credit card bill this month.

38:02.867 --> 38:05.536
Oh. And you're going
to need a new toaster.

38:07.204 --> 38:09.498
I tapped into the main power line.

38:09.623 --> 38:12.460
Hopefully we'll be able
to draw enough energy.

38:12.585 --> 38:14.628
Then what?

38:14.754 --> 38:17.673
Go to Velona and stop your people
from using the weapon.

38:18.007 --> 38:20.760
They won't listen to you.
They have orders.

38:20.843 --> 38:23.679
- I'll have to make them listen.
- They could kill you.

38:23.763 --> 38:26.307
(radio) Major Carter. Report.

38:28.392 --> 38:30.770
Major Carter, respond immediately.

38:32.980 --> 38:35.024
Carter.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.403
Carter, what are you doing?

38:40.988 --> 38:44.367
- Move in.
- All teams, we have a go for entry.

38:44.492 --> 38:47.244
- We're comin' in.
- (commander) Go, go, go.

38:48.537 --> 38:51.874
I was really hoping
that there would be another way.

39:13.229 --> 39:15.272
You know how I feel about you.

39:16.899 --> 39:18.943
I hope this isn't goodbye.

39:54.562 --> 39:56.605
Orlin!

40:15.499 --> 40:17.543
Don't move!

40:19.003 --> 40:22.089
- Hold your fire! I know this man.
- He attacked us.

40:23.591 --> 40:26.010
Colonel, please, lower your weapon.

40:28.846 --> 40:32.767
- He has good reason to stop this test.
- I have orders from General Hammond.

40:32.892 --> 40:36.771
I know. Let's just dial out
and talk to the general about it.

40:36.896 --> 40:38.939
I can't do that.

40:42.151 --> 40:46.947
Your instructions said if we aborted the
energy build-up, the reactor would blow.

40:47.073 --> 40:51.702
He's right. If we disconnect
the reactor now, it will explode.

40:51.827 --> 40:54.580
Good. The weapon will be destroyed.

40:56.165 --> 40:59.418
I can't let that happen, Major.

41:17.061 --> 41:19.146
I can't believe how much this hurts.

41:19.480 --> 41:22.316
- Just hang on.
- Major, we gotta get outta here.

41:22.483 --> 41:27.530
We can't dial out. We can't risk the blast
wave translating through the wormhole.

41:30.533 --> 41:32.576
I have to go, Sam.

41:36.664 --> 41:39.500
They're giving me another chance.

41:43.170 --> 41:45.923
It's the only way that I can save you.
