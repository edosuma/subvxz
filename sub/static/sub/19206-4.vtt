00:06.070 --> 00:08.671
- And you saw the picture?
- I think everyone on campus did.

00:08.706 --> 00:09.872
Were you offended?

00:09.907 --> 00:11.272
I don't let stuff like that get to me.

00:11.307 --> 00:13.174
I wish everyone felt that way.

00:13.209 --> 00:16.844
I'm tired of not having a voice,

00:16.880 --> 00:19.981
and I can't live in a place
that doesn't even ask black kids

00:20.016 --> 00:22.316
how they feel when there's
a race issue on the table.

00:22.351 --> 00:23.718
I had no idea.

00:23.753 --> 00:25.853
Chris Walker.
90-mile-an-hour fastball...

00:25.889 --> 00:28.354
John Kennish is going to take this team

00:28.390 --> 00:30.624
to the College World Series.

00:30.659 --> 00:32.325
Your signed letter of intent.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.961
You made the right decision, son.

00:38.834 --> 00:40.400
Emmett, don't. I...

00:46.674 --> 00:49.675
Uh, I... I have to work.

my god, what's going on?

01:11.299 --> 01:12.231
Are you okay?

01:16.143 --> 01:17.376
- Uh, okay.
- (soft rock music playing)

01:17.979 --> 01:19.078
About what?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.258
That's great.

01:44.601 --> 01:45.600
Um...

01:46.106 --> 01:47.905
<i>♪ That you hid behind your eyes ♪</i>

01:47.940 --> 01:50.208
I'm flattered, but I can't help you.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.308
(music stops)

01:51.363 --> 01:53.864
I'm not allowed to ink
clients at the shop yet.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
I'm just an apprentice.

02:01.106 --> 02:05.175
Yeah, uh, but apparently
that doesn't mean much here.

02:08.683 --> 02:11.284
My boss is a little territorial

02:11.320 --> 02:14.154
and even if I did get her on board,

02:14.189 --> 02:16.389
I still need someone to work on.

02:24.298 --> 02:25.331
You?

02:26.968 --> 02:30.336
Uh, maybe because you've never talked

02:30.371 --> 02:32.839
about getting one before now?

02:45.268 --> 02:46.401
(sighs)

02:46.436 --> 02:48.103
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

02:51.159 --> 02:52.758
It means I'll think about it.

02:58.631 --> 03:01.867
(panting)

03:01.902 --> 03:03.434
I so needed that.

03:03.470 --> 03:04.635
Same here.

03:05.739 --> 03:07.772
Hey, saw your old roomie last night.

03:07.807 --> 03:08.806
- Iris?
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.842 --> 03:10.275
- Where?
- Party at Walsh.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.977
There's an all-black floor.
Guess she lives there.

03:12.012 --> 03:13.678
Oh. How'd she seem?

03:13.713 --> 03:15.679
From what I could tell, great.

03:15.714 --> 03:17.314
Good. I'm glad.

03:17.350 --> 03:19.416
I take it you two
haven't patched things up.

03:19.451 --> 03:21.651
(sighs) I've tried,

03:21.687 --> 03:24.088
but she won't text me back.

03:24.123 --> 03:25.489
Hey, her loss.

03:25.524 --> 03:26.723
Thanks.

03:28.494 --> 03:29.693
What the...

03:39.843 --> 03:42.143
Why are there cotton balls everywhere?

03:42.178 --> 03:44.813
Because somebody's trying
to put us in our place.

03:53.200 --> 03:58.200
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

04:00.489 --> 04:02.822
Cotton balls as a reminder of slavery?

04:02.858 --> 04:04.691
That's totally disgusting.

04:05.761 --> 04:06.793
Are you okay?

04:06.828 --> 04:08.695
Yeah.

04:08.730 --> 04:09.729
Just not surprised.

04:09.765 --> 04:12.599
Well, I'm sure they're
gonna find whoever did this.

04:12.634 --> 04:13.767
I wouldn't hold your breath.

04:13.802 --> 04:16.702
Come on, no one's gonna
ignore something this bad.

04:17.805 --> 04:20.572
Well, then we need to do something.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.641
We need to talk to someone.

04:21.676 --> 04:22.709
Count me out.

04:22.744 --> 04:25.545
I got work-study and
homework piling up.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.681
Professor Marillo is the new
Associate Dean of Student Well-Being.

04:28.717 --> 04:30.550
I am sure she would listen to us.

04:31.620 --> 04:32.619
Good luck.

04:32.654 --> 04:34.454
I gotta go.

04:42.598 --> 04:44.197
I am assuming you're gonna wanna

04:44.233 --> 04:46.500
hang this in a place of honor.

04:46.535 --> 04:48.134
Oh, yeah, like on a rack at Goodwill.

04:48.170 --> 04:49.302
Ouch.

04:49.338 --> 04:51.137
Hey, I'm helping you turn my
room into Carlton's nursery.

04:51.173 --> 04:52.506
I get a free pass for at least a week.

04:52.541 --> 04:53.573
(chuckles) Fair enough.

04:53.609 --> 04:55.509
Uh, can I get your advice on something?

04:55.544 --> 04:56.543
Sure. What's up?

04:56.698 --> 04:58.531
I saw Emmett last night.

04:58.567 --> 04:59.532
How's he doing?

04:59.568 --> 05:01.368
A lot better.

05:01.403 --> 05:02.535
He's taking a photography class

05:02.571 --> 05:05.505
and he wants to take photos
of me giving him a tattoo.

05:05.540 --> 05:06.506
And you don't want to?

05:06.541 --> 05:08.508
No, I love the idea,

05:08.543 --> 05:10.343
and if I nail the execution,

05:10.379 --> 05:12.312
Noelle might finally
start taking me seriously.

05:12.347 --> 05:14.347
- But, um...
- Travis.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.250
Do you think you and Emmett can

05:17.285 --> 05:19.219
work on a project together
without it meaning something?

05:19.254 --> 05:20.286
Of course.

05:20.322 --> 05:22.288
It would just be an
artistic collaboration.

05:22.324 --> 05:23.590
It's a win-win for both of us.

05:24.693 --> 05:26.593
Look, I've been in Travis' position.

05:26.628 --> 05:28.194
Just be upfront with him.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.529
Let him know he's got
nothing to worry about.

05:30.666 --> 05:32.198
Right. Thanks.

05:36.538 --> 05:38.605
Now, look, I assure you, this
is a very inclusive campus

05:38.640 --> 05:41.408
and this administration
will not tolerate

05:41.443 --> 05:42.709
anything to the contrary.

05:42.744 --> 05:46.346
According to some of my friends,
this isn't an isolated incident.

05:46.381 --> 05:48.448
They say racist stuff
happens a lot on campus.

05:48.483 --> 05:51.317
Have your friends
reported these occurrences?

05:51.353 --> 05:52.452
I'm not sure.

05:52.487 --> 05:54.387
Now see... (sighs)

05:54.423 --> 05:56.356
that's a problem.

05:56.391 --> 05:58.358
How can we address their concerns

05:58.393 --> 06:01.161
if we don't even know that
there's an issue to begin with?

06:01.196 --> 06:03.563
I think some of them are afraid
they won't be taken seriously.

06:03.598 --> 06:04.698
Well, they're wrong.

06:04.808 --> 06:08.309
We have systems in place
to handle things like this.

06:08.345 --> 06:10.712
The most effective action
that your friends can take

06:10.747 --> 06:12.614
is alerting the university.

06:12.649 --> 06:13.648
Okay.

06:13.683 --> 06:14.716
Thank you for your time.

06:15.786 --> 06:18.520
Daphne, hold up.

06:18.555 --> 06:22.657
I received a very interesting
phone call yesterday

06:22.692 --> 06:25.627
from a Dr. Yao in Beijing.

06:25.662 --> 06:27.629
Ling? Oh, my god, she's amazing.

06:27.664 --> 06:30.565
Well, she had some pretty lovely
things to say about you too.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.468
She was very impressed with
your work in her clinic.

06:33.503 --> 06:34.536
I learned so much from her.

06:34.571 --> 06:36.471
It got me thinking.

06:36.506 --> 06:42.277
Maybe the department was
hasty in denying you credit

06:42.312 --> 06:44.345
for the work you did in Yao's clinic.

06:44.381 --> 06:45.513
Oh?

06:45.549 --> 06:49.717
I'd like to revisit your request
with the Department Chair.

06:49.753 --> 06:52.320
I mean, you know, if
that's okay with you.

06:52.355 --> 06:53.588
Yes!

06:53.623 --> 06:54.622
Absolutely!

06:54.658 --> 06:56.758
Look, I realize now that I may have...

06:56.793 --> 06:59.727
misjudged your medical prospects.

07:01.498 --> 07:03.631
However I can help with
the cause moving forward,

07:03.667 --> 07:06.501
you just know that you've
got my support, okay?

07:07.604 --> 07:08.536
Thank you, Professor.

07:10.540 --> 07:12.407
It means a lot.

07:23.386 --> 07:24.352
- Kathryn.
- Hey.

07:24.387 --> 07:25.420
You up for some whale hunting?

07:25.455 --> 07:27.422
You know it. How big are we talking?

07:27.457 --> 07:29.324
A great white.

07:29.359 --> 07:32.393
Gavin Bowers, former UMKC Q.B., 1980...

07:32.429 --> 07:34.662
Owner of the largest

07:34.698 --> 07:36.297
self-storage chain in the Midwest

07:36.333 --> 07:38.299
and our top booster
for three years running.

07:38.335 --> 07:39.634
Someone's been doing her homework.

07:39.669 --> 07:40.668
Yes.

07:40.704 --> 07:42.303
Well, I'm hoping to
keep that streak alive.

07:42.339 --> 07:44.672
He's flying in tomorrow night
for our annual wine and dine,

07:44.708 --> 07:47.575
and I want you by my
side to help turn that

07:47.611 --> 07:49.510
five-figure check into six figures.

07:49.546 --> 07:51.512
Great. I will walk him through the plans

07:51.548 --> 07:53.514
for the football stadium renovation.

07:53.550 --> 07:56.384
Oh! And the NCAA just posted

07:56.419 --> 07:58.386
our student-athlete
graduation success rate.

07:58.421 --> 08:00.288
It's at 92%!

08:00.357 --> 08:02.290
Oh, bring it on!

08:02.325 --> 08:04.359
7:30. Carter's Steakhouse.

08:04.394 --> 08:05.360
Wow.

08:05.395 --> 08:08.263
Oh, and, uh, he's a leg
man, so wear a dress.

08:08.298 --> 08:09.297
(chuckles)

08:11.334 --> 08:12.333
Seriously?

08:12.369 --> 08:13.668
That's part of the game.

08:13.703 --> 08:16.304
Gavin's married, but he likes to flirt.

08:16.339 --> 08:18.640
Heh, it's for a good cause, right?

08:20.343 --> 08:21.676
Right.

08:21.711 --> 08:22.677
All right.

08:22.712 --> 08:23.711
Let's do this.

08:28.752 --> 08:30.618
(hip-hop music playing)

08:32.554 --> 08:33.520
(door opens)

08:36.525 --> 08:37.592
Uh, hey.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.427
Ho-ho, hey!

08:39.462 --> 08:41.529
G.I. Joe, did you get my text?

08:41.563 --> 08:43.563
I need to talk to you about something.

08:47.570 --> 08:51.472
(scoffs) Do I need to
stage an intervention?

08:51.508 --> 08:54.742
You look exhausted. What...

08:58.315 --> 09:00.315
I don't think that it
is physically possible

09:00.350 --> 09:02.216
for you to be in better shape.

09:11.661 --> 09:13.494
Whoa, hey, easy there, all right?

09:13.530 --> 09:14.662
Just breathe. Relax.

09:19.703 --> 09:21.569
You can do this.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.504
I know that you can.

09:23.540 --> 09:26.374
You just have to stop
psyching yourself out.

09:39.456 --> 09:40.455
Forget it.

09:40.490 --> 09:41.456
It can wait.

09:41.491 --> 09:43.724
Get back to your training.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.327
Oh. (laughs) Definitely.

09:52.445 --> 09:54.448
All right. Let's see some here, Chris.

09:54.449 --> 09:57.350
- Come on, nice and easy.
- (rock music playing)

10:03.291 --> 10:04.257
Yeah!

10:04.292 --> 10:06.192
Nice job painting the
corners there, buddy.

10:06.228 --> 10:07.360
One more now.

10:07.395 --> 10:09.195
Nice and smooth.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.265
Yes.

10:15.170 --> 10:18.204
Uh, he's a recent
transfer from Michigan.

10:18.240 --> 10:22.041
His name is Chris Walker.

10:22.077 --> 10:24.110
He's, uh, starting next week.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.113
Travis, come on.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.048
You've been away from the game

10:29.084 --> 10:30.149
for almost a year.

10:30.185 --> 10:33.119
Look, we're up against the Eagles.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.089
They're one of the best teams
in the whole league, okay?

10:36.124 --> 10:38.424
If we want to beat them, we
gotta be bringing some heat.

10:41.096 --> 10:42.428
I know you've been working hard,

10:42.464 --> 10:44.998
but the regionals are on the line here.

10:46.334 --> 10:47.367
Carlos, charge the ball!

10:47.402 --> 10:50.236
Don't let the ball play you! Come on!

10:50.272 --> 10:51.204
Hold on.

10:54.276 --> 10:57.210
Travis, I have to make the best
decision for the entire team.

10:57.245 --> 11:01.147
Okay? Chris is where I
need him to be right now.

11:01.182 --> 11:04.083
I will get you back on track. I promise.

11:04.119 --> 11:06.019
Yo, Coach.

11:06.054 --> 11:07.186
Is this the back-up catcher?

11:07.222 --> 11:10.056
'Cause Martinez looks like he
needs to ice down that hand.

11:10.091 --> 11:12.992
No, this is Travis.
He's our second starter.

11:13.028 --> 11:15.128
Travis, this is Chris. I
was telling you about him.

11:17.032 --> 11:18.398
I hope you like the bullpen.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.433
All right, get back out there.

11:20.468 --> 11:22.402
All right, I'm gonna catch you later.

11:26.408 --> 11:28.441
(rock music playing)

11:30.412 --> 11:32.278
You bring the vodka too?

11:32.314 --> 11:35.415
After that four-hour session,
I'd kill for a screwdriver.

11:35.450 --> 11:37.350
I cannot believe your
hand didn't cramp up.

11:37.385 --> 11:39.218
You've got serious stamina.

11:40.355 --> 11:42.221
So, uh...

11:42.257 --> 11:43.189
(inhales)

11:43.224 --> 11:45.124
I was wondering...

11:45.160 --> 11:47.226
No, you're not ready for a chair.

11:47.262 --> 11:49.195
Slow your roll, Padawan.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.229
You've been here like a week.

11:50.265 --> 11:52.031
Hear me out, okay?

11:52.067 --> 11:54.067
I'm not asking to work on
customers, just one of my friends.

11:54.102 --> 11:55.201
In my shop, using my machines.

11:55.236 --> 11:58.071
I've done this before, dozens of times.

11:58.106 --> 11:59.138
In another country.

11:59.174 --> 12:01.941
It would be after hours
and he's not paying for it.

12:01.977 --> 12:03.376
He won't post it on Instagram.

12:03.411 --> 12:05.378
No one will know.

12:05.413 --> 12:06.980
And we'll sign whatever waiver you want.

12:07.015 --> 12:08.982
Just please, at least consider it?

12:11.419 --> 12:13.419
Let me see 'em.

12:13.455 --> 12:15.221
It's a Zhu Que.

12:15.256 --> 12:18.324
They're, uh, pretty huge
in Chinese mythology.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.326
I like the vibrancy,

12:20.362 --> 12:23.196
but your shading's patchy.

12:23.231 --> 12:25.164
You need more layers. See?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.333
If you want to make it pop,
you need clean transitions.

12:27.369 --> 12:30.103
You can't just slap it on.

12:30.138 --> 12:31.170
You gotta give it life.

12:31.206 --> 12:34.107
So, that's a yes?

12:36.111 --> 12:38.978
If you've got a friend that
wants to be your guinea pig,

12:39.014 --> 12:40.980
off the record, have at it, but...

12:41.016 --> 12:43.416
you might want to do a
few practice runs first.

12:43.451 --> 12:46.019
<i>♪ You've got my heart
on pins and needles ♪</i>

12:46.054 --> 12:48.388
<i>♪ You've got a voodoo, darling ♪</i>

12:51.393 --> 12:53.326
He actually said that?

12:53.361 --> 12:54.994
Isn't that sexual harassment?

12:55.030 --> 12:55.995
I know, right?

12:56.031 --> 12:58.297
I was like, "What is this, 1950?"

12:58.333 --> 13:00.933
Men are always gonna expect
women to peacock a little.

13:00.969 --> 13:05.171
I know, but should I
really wear a leggy dress?

13:05.206 --> 13:08.174
When I worked at K&D,

13:08.209 --> 13:10.176
I would dress for clients all the time.

13:10.211 --> 13:13.146
We all know women judge
each other on our clothes,

13:13.181 --> 13:14.347
so I played along.

13:14.382 --> 13:17.216
The right purse, the right shoes,

13:17.252 --> 13:19.085
and now that I'm a student here,

13:19.120 --> 13:21.220
I try to dress more
like them so I fit in.

13:21.256 --> 13:23.056
Is that any different?

13:23.091 --> 13:24.157
I guess not.

13:24.192 --> 13:26.092
You know, it's a game,

13:26.127 --> 13:28.061
but you are in charge.

13:28.096 --> 13:29.128
You're pulling the strings.

13:29.164 --> 13:30.229
Just remember that.

13:30.265 --> 13:34.033
I know, but is this us
just spinning the situation

13:34.069 --> 13:37.070
to make us feel better about
shaking our asses a little?

13:37.105 --> 13:39.005
Maybe.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.440
You could always show up in a pantsuit

13:40.475 --> 13:42.442
like a big "screw you."

13:42.477 --> 13:44.377
(laughs)

13:44.412 --> 13:47.013
Oh, I can't believe I
have to deal with this.

13:47.048 --> 13:49.382
Oh, welcome to working in a man's world.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.317
I have to go, okay?

13:51.352 --> 13:53.319
- Oh, thank you.
- Good luck.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.454
Thank you.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.359
Iris.

14:00.395 --> 14:02.195
Hey.

14:03.231 --> 14:04.230
Hey.

14:05.366 --> 14:08.101
- It's good to see you.
- Look, I'm busy, so...

14:08.136 --> 14:09.235
Hey, I just wanted you to know

14:09.270 --> 14:11.237
that I spoke with Professor Marillo.

14:11.272 --> 14:15.141
She said that any time you
experience anything racist,

14:15.176 --> 14:17.076
you need to report it immediately.

14:17.152 --> 14:18.918
Right.

14:18.953 --> 14:20.920
Like that'll do any good.

14:20.955 --> 14:23.056
No, it will. She said
there are systems in place.

14:23.091 --> 14:24.991
Then explain the cotton ballers.

14:25.026 --> 14:26.025
What do you mean?

14:26.061 --> 14:28.327
You know about the cotton balls

14:28.363 --> 14:29.929
in front of the Black Student Union?

14:29.964 --> 14:31.964
Yeah, it was disgusting.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.233
The police caught who did it.

14:34.269 --> 14:36.369
Two guys from Dillon Hall.

14:36.404 --> 14:37.904
That's a relief.

14:39.274 --> 14:41.240
You want to know what happened to them?

14:42.277 --> 14:43.209
What?

14:44.279 --> 14:46.145
They got tickets...

14:46.181 --> 14:48.081
for littering.

14:48.116 --> 14:49.182
Seriously?

14:49.217 --> 14:50.416
Yep.

14:50.452 --> 14:54.087
Then Dean Peterson suspended
them for three days. That's it.

14:56.024 --> 14:59.092
That's crazy and insulting.

14:59.127 --> 15:00.093
(sighs)

15:00.128 --> 15:01.928
We finally agree on something.

15:03.064 --> 15:04.964
I am tired of talking.

15:04.999 --> 15:06.032
It's time for action.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.267
So, you're hunger striking?

15:09.337 --> 15:11.270
I'm camping in front of the B.S.U.

15:11.306 --> 15:14.307
and refusing to eat until
those guys are expelled.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.376
Wow, that's serious.

15:18.947 --> 15:20.279
So is what's happening on campus.

15:20.315 --> 15:22.181
Okay, but...

15:22.217 --> 15:24.150
you know how unsafe that is?

15:24.185 --> 15:26.252
I already don't feel safe.

15:26.287 --> 15:28.087
Hey, Iris, no. There are ways

15:28.123 --> 15:30.189
of fighting that don't
jeopardize your health.

15:30.225 --> 15:32.158
We could boycott classes,

15:32.193 --> 15:35.128
we could lead a march,
organize a town hall meeting.

15:35.163 --> 15:36.195
You don't get it!

15:36.231 --> 15:39.098
A hunger strike makes a huge statement.

15:39.134 --> 15:41.100
This is the best way to get attention.

15:41.136 --> 15:44.003
I just want you to be
smart about how you...

15:44.038 --> 15:45.138
Look, Katy Perry,

15:45.173 --> 15:48.941
she doesn't need you
telling her what's smart.

15:48.977 --> 15:50.076
I was talking to Iris.

15:50.111 --> 15:53.312
Why don't you run along
to your BFF, Lil Wayne?

15:54.983 --> 15:55.982
You should probably go.

15:57.018 --> 15:58.351
- Iris.
- Just go.

16:15.627 --> 16:17.594
I thought you said you'd handle it.

16:17.629 --> 16:19.663
How is a three-day
suspension handling it?

16:19.698 --> 16:21.565
Look, I understand.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.533
Believe me, I feel the same way,

16:23.569 --> 16:25.602
but this decision was not just up to me.

16:25.637 --> 16:28.371
How does someone get away
with a slap on the wrist

16:28.407 --> 16:29.406
for a hate crime?

16:29.441 --> 16:32.442
Dean Peterson and I reviewed the case.

16:32.477 --> 16:34.811
We just couldn't prove intent.

16:34.846 --> 16:36.413
Two white guys put cotton balls

16:36.448 --> 16:37.781
in front of the Black Student Union.

16:37.816 --> 16:39.416
What else could that possibly mean?

16:39.451 --> 16:41.718
The students involved are claiming

16:41.753 --> 16:43.720
that it was an artistic statement

16:43.755 --> 16:44.788
to make people think.

16:44.823 --> 16:46.723
Oh, please.

16:46.758 --> 16:49.759
Look, someone in charge
better do something fast

16:49.795 --> 16:52.729
'cause people are starting to
take matters into their own hands.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.699
What are you talking about?

16:55.734 --> 16:58.535
My old roommate is planning
to stage a hunger strike

16:58.570 --> 16:59.703
in front of the B.S.U.

16:59.738 --> 17:02.472
She shouldn't have to endanger
her life to get justice.

17:02.507 --> 17:03.640
Well, of course not.

17:03.675 --> 17:05.575
This is the first I've heard of it.

17:05.611 --> 17:06.742
I'll get on it right away.

17:06.778 --> 17:10.413
Someone needs to organize
a... an open forum on campus,

17:10.449 --> 17:11.647
get a dialog started.

17:11.683 --> 17:13.451
The school needs to prove it cares about

17:13.452 --> 17:15.089
the well-being of all its students.

17:15.420 --> 17:18.320
That's an excellent idea.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.573
You ratted me out to Dean Peterson?

18:43.608 --> 18:46.476
No, I spoke to Professor Marillo...

18:46.511 --> 18:49.412
Who told Dean Peterson,
who called my dad!

18:49.448 --> 18:50.513
Now he's freaking out.

18:50.549 --> 18:52.415
He threatened to pull me from school

18:52.451 --> 18:53.550
if I continue with the hunger strike.

18:53.585 --> 18:56.519
Iris, I am so sorry.
That was not my intention.

18:56.555 --> 18:58.488
I was trying to help, I swear.

18:58.523 --> 19:00.423
I didn't ask for your help.

19:00.459 --> 19:04.327
Stop trying to be the
great white hope, okay?

19:04.362 --> 19:05.361
I can handle this.

19:10.736 --> 19:12.769
(rock music playing)

19:19.911 --> 19:21.745
Oh, you mean rip off Noelle's work?

19:21.780 --> 19:22.746
No way.

19:26.585 --> 19:28.651
Some do, but not Noelle.

19:28.687 --> 19:31.588
All of her designs are
completely original.

19:31.623 --> 19:33.623
It's like having Banksy ink you.

19:33.658 --> 19:35.458
She's a real artist.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.406
Um...

19:52.544 --> 19:55.378
It wasn't the right time.

19:55.413 --> 19:58.448
But you and I are not
talking about this.

19:58.483 --> 19:59.816
Travis is off limits.

19:59.851 --> 20:01.718
(door closes)

20:04.389 --> 20:05.388
This the guinea pig?

20:05.423 --> 20:06.723
Uh, yes.

20:06.758 --> 20:09.692
Noelle, meet Emmett.

20:09.728 --> 20:11.828
Ballsy move offering up
your skin to a rookie.

20:20.639 --> 20:22.605
He says thank you for
letting us use your shop.

20:22.641 --> 20:23.606
No problem.

20:23.642 --> 20:24.707
Lock up when you're done.

20:31.516 --> 20:34.484
Yeah, but impossible to impress.

20:37.522 --> 20:38.521
I do.

20:38.557 --> 20:41.457
Her stuff is just so vivid

20:41.493 --> 20:43.700
and... and detailed and unique.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.766
Okay, so what'll it be?

20:54.806 --> 20:57.407
You want MJ on your arm?

21:01.926 --> 21:05.682
How about the chestburster
from <i> Alien?</i> Right?

21:05.717 --> 21:07.584
Nice, big, right there.

21:10.021 --> 21:11.788
(chuckles) I was joking.

21:11.823 --> 21:13.656
I mean, it would be fun to ink,

21:13.692 --> 21:15.625
but I am so not the one
explaining that to Melody.

21:17.696 --> 21:19.696
Oh, Ripley! Your old motorcycle!

21:19.731 --> 21:22.565
Oh, I miss that girl.

21:22.601 --> 21:24.434
Do you have a picture?

21:24.469 --> 21:25.602
Let's do this.

21:29.474 --> 21:31.841
I don't blame her for being mad.

21:31.877 --> 21:33.409
At Marillo, sure,

21:33.445 --> 21:36.379
but I don't see where
you did anything wrong.

21:36.414 --> 21:37.413
What do you think?

21:37.449 --> 21:38.815
I think your heart's in the right place,

21:38.850 --> 21:40.483
but maybe it's not your battle to fight.

21:40.518 --> 21:41.584
(sighs)

21:41.653 --> 21:44.787
But if Iris gets sick and
ends up in the hospital,

21:44.823 --> 21:46.756
then how does that help?

21:46.791 --> 21:48.825
Hunger strikes do tend to get attention.

21:48.860 --> 21:50.393
And results.

21:50.428 --> 21:52.762
So, do you think she's
doing the right thing?

21:54.733 --> 21:56.699
I'm worried about her health of course,

21:56.735 --> 22:00.603
but if she's that committed
to the cause, then...

22:00.639 --> 22:01.638
maybe you need to respect

22:01.673 --> 22:03.673
her willingness to take such a risk.

22:10.649 --> 22:12.482
Oh, my god.

22:13.551 --> 22:14.517
What?

22:20.492 --> 22:22.358
"Watch your back"?

22:31.823 --> 22:33.331
Mike: Our new training facility

22:33.349 --> 22:35.649
will be the finest
west of the Mississippi.

22:35.685 --> 22:36.750
We're also planning

22:36.786 --> 22:39.687
an extensive expansion of
the track and field arena.

22:39.722 --> 22:41.622
Oh, was that your sport? Track?

22:41.657 --> 22:42.756
No, actually I was a cheerleader.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.526
Oh. That makes sense.

22:46.846 --> 22:48.846
So, Gavin, um, you've built

22:48.881 --> 22:51.648
quite the self-storage empire.

22:51.684 --> 22:52.649
What's your secret?

22:52.685 --> 22:54.818
Our top two demos: the big ho's.

22:54.854 --> 22:55.786
What?

22:55.821 --> 22:57.788
Homeless and hoarders. (laughs)

22:57.823 --> 22:58.756
(laughs)

22:58.791 --> 23:00.557
Hey, Mikey,

23:00.593 --> 23:02.559
say it ain't so... you got engaged?

23:02.595 --> 23:03.627
Afraid the rumor's true.

23:03.696 --> 23:05.662
I got two words for you. Pre. Nup.

23:05.698 --> 23:07.564
My first wife swore up and down

23:07.600 --> 23:08.632
she was gonna have her own career

23:08.667 --> 23:10.601
and then promptly took
me to the cleaners.

23:10.636 --> 23:12.569
Just like a woman, right?

23:12.605 --> 23:14.538
Not every woman.

23:14.573 --> 23:15.606
Oh, come on.

23:15.641 --> 23:17.541
If you and I were to
get married right now,

23:17.576 --> 23:20.477
- and remember, I'm loaded...
- (Gavin's phone vibrates)

23:20.513 --> 23:21.545
would you sign a prenup?

23:21.580 --> 23:23.414
I don't even know how to answer that.

23:23.449 --> 23:26.483
Hm! Oh, ball and chain number two.

23:26.519 --> 23:27.751
Excuse me.

23:27.787 --> 23:29.753
Hey, baby-cakes.

23:29.789 --> 23:30.788
I have to run.

23:30.823 --> 23:32.423
What? You're going now?

23:32.458 --> 23:33.791
Come on, you got this.

23:33.826 --> 23:35.793
- I can't.
- Gavin: Yeah, sure. Whatever you want.

23:37.696 --> 23:38.729
- Gavin?
- Yeah?

23:38.764 --> 23:39.863
- Always a pleasure.
- Oh!

23:39.899 --> 23:44.635
I am going to leave you
in Kathryn's capable hands.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.570
- Oh, you're too good to me, Mikey.
- (chuckles)

23:47.673 --> 23:48.605
See you tomorrow.

23:49.708 --> 23:50.674
(grunts)

23:50.709 --> 23:51.708
Another martini?

23:51.744 --> 23:53.644
Uh, no, no. Thank you.

23:53.679 --> 23:55.712
Oh, come on, the night
is young and so are we.

23:55.748 --> 23:57.481
Excuse me, give me two more.

23:57.516 --> 23:58.649
- Uh-huh.
- I...

23:58.684 --> 23:59.650
Cheers.

24:05.424 --> 24:06.457
Are you kidding me?

24:06.492 --> 24:07.558
Son-of-a...

24:07.593 --> 24:10.494
No one threatens my daughter
and gets away with it.

24:10.529 --> 24:12.429
Okay, let's not overreact.

24:12.465 --> 24:14.465
It's a flyer, not a car bomb.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.400
And how do we know that that's not next?

24:16.435 --> 24:18.802
This is all because Mingo
wore that stupid costume.

24:18.838 --> 24:19.790
It's not his fault.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.578
And then you wrote that
op-ed defending him.

24:21.580 --> 24:23.440
- Mom!
- Excuse me, you're blaming her?

24:23.476 --> 24:25.876
- She's the victim here.
- This person tracked down my car.

24:25.911 --> 24:27.811
- What if he follows me home?
- That's it.

24:27.847 --> 24:30.714
You and Bay are staying
here until this blows over.

24:30.749 --> 24:31.682
She shouldn't have to hide.

24:32.818 --> 24:33.784
Toby: Dad?

24:33.819 --> 24:34.818
John, what are you doing?

24:34.854 --> 24:37.621
Whatever it takes to
protect my daughter.

24:43.729 --> 24:46.630
So, knowing your generosity
level in the past,

24:46.665 --> 24:48.632
if you were to donate
at an elevated level,

24:48.667 --> 24:50.467
we could green-light the renovations...

24:50.503 --> 24:52.469
Cannot take my eyes off of this.

24:52.505 --> 24:54.571
It really suits you.

24:54.607 --> 24:56.540
- Thank you, but...
- To earn it,

24:56.575 --> 24:59.409
your husband must have pissed
you off something terrible.

24:59.445 --> 25:01.478
No, no, no, it was just a...
a normal birthday present.

25:01.514 --> 25:02.579
Yeah? And you know,

25:02.615 --> 25:05.382
beautiful women always
have such beautiful hands.

25:05.417 --> 25:06.383
- Uh...
- It's amazing.

25:07.853 --> 25:08.852
Excuse me,

25:08.888 --> 25:10.754
could we have the check please?

25:10.789 --> 25:12.723
We're gonna go and have sex.

25:13.893 --> 25:16.393
- Wait, what?
- That's what you want, right?

25:16.428 --> 25:17.661
To seal the deal?

25:17.696 --> 25:19.796
I didn't... I never said that.

25:19.832 --> 25:21.832
Gavin, you have been
hitting on me all night.

25:21.867 --> 25:23.700
Okay, we're done here.

25:23.736 --> 25:26.570
Are you sure? Because we
could do it right here.

25:26.605 --> 25:27.671
Lady, you're nuts.

25:32.545 --> 25:33.544
(folk music playing)

25:33.579 --> 25:36.580
(shutter clicking)

25:38.717 --> 25:42.586

25:46.759 --> 25:47.891

25:57.803 --> 25:59.736
Um, what does that mean?

26:06.278 --> 26:07.811
I felt awful about that.

26:15.754 --> 26:18.555
Seeing my art up there,

26:18.591 --> 26:21.592
easily one of the coolest moments ever.

26:33.606 --> 26:35.472

27:19.674 --> 27:22.041
Yes, Dean Peterson. All right.

27:22.076 --> 27:23.676
Thank you so much for your support.

27:23.711 --> 27:25.611
It means a lot. Thank you so much.

27:25.647 --> 27:27.447
Okay, yeah. Bye-bye.

27:27.448 --> 27:29.015
Uh, sure.

27:34.622 --> 27:36.622
Oh. (chuckle) Are you serious?

27:36.658 --> 27:38.958
Travis doesn't like my decision,

27:38.993 --> 27:40.059
and so he sends his mom?

27:44.899 --> 27:45.932
Okay, all right.

27:45.967 --> 27:47.900
Last time you and I had
a little talk like this,

27:47.936 --> 27:51.003
you kind of ripped into me
for derailing his future.

28:00.081 --> 28:01.747
Well, it didn't seem like that

28:01.783 --> 28:02.815
when he took off to China.

28:05.887 --> 28:07.753
Okay, but that doesn't excuse

28:07.789 --> 28:09.822
the fact that he abandoned
his responsibilities.

28:14.796 --> 28:15.795
It's not enough.

28:35.016 --> 28:37.016
Let's not get ahead of
ourselves here, all right?

28:46.861 --> 28:47.827
Fine.

28:47.862 --> 28:50.830
Travis and Chris, they
can have a pitch-off

28:50.865 --> 28:52.765
and we can see who's starter material,

28:52.800 --> 28:53.766
but let me tell you something.

28:53.801 --> 28:56.702
If Travis really wants this,

28:56.738 --> 28:59.672
he has got to bring his "A" game.

29:02.643 --> 29:03.776
You're welcome.

29:03.811 --> 29:04.777
I'll see you.

29:11.586 --> 29:12.785
Hey, did you hear?

29:12.820 --> 29:14.787
They caught the guy who made that flyer.

29:14.822 --> 29:16.655
Yeah, a black student.

29:16.691 --> 29:18.691
Dean Peterson expelled
him thanks to your dad.

29:19.761 --> 29:21.594
You don't think he should've been?

29:21.629 --> 29:23.662
Can we not talk about this right now?

29:23.698 --> 29:24.930
I'm trying to study.

29:24.966 --> 29:25.898
Hold on.

29:27.668 --> 29:28.901
I want to hear this.

29:31.072 --> 29:32.905
Okay.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.006
Let's do the math.

29:34.042 --> 29:37.009
White girl gets intimidated,
the guy gets expelled.

29:37.045 --> 29:39.879
The entire Black Student
Union gets intimidated,

29:39.914 --> 29:41.047
three-day suspension.

29:41.082 --> 29:44.184
Well, but one was a threat.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.673
Cotton balls in front of
the Black Student Union,

29:47.709 --> 29:48.774
you know what that makes me think of?

29:48.810 --> 29:51.777
Chains and whips and
keeping the black man down.

29:51.813 --> 29:54.747
That is a threat just like that flyer.

29:54.782 --> 29:56.782
And maybe it's right
the guy got expelled,

29:56.818 --> 29:58.751
but the cotton ballers
should have been too.

30:00.655 --> 30:01.687
I hadn't thought of it like that.

30:01.723 --> 30:03.522
Why would you?

30:03.558 --> 30:05.691
It's not your reality,
and be glad that it isn't.

30:05.727 --> 30:07.693
The fear that you felt over that flyer,

30:07.729 --> 30:09.628
I feel like that all the time.

30:09.664 --> 30:11.530
See you later.

30:23.978 --> 30:25.011
(scoffs)

30:27.849 --> 30:28.814
Move along, Katy Perry.

30:29.917 --> 30:30.883
You're not welcome here.

30:36.924 --> 30:39.692
Iris, can I talk to you, please?

30:40.895 --> 30:41.827
I got this.

30:48.736 --> 30:52.571
Look, I can never know
what it's like to be you.

30:53.775 --> 30:56.509
All I can really offer is my support.

30:58.012 --> 31:01.580
So, if you'll let me, I'd
like to sit here with you.

33:28.762 --> 33:29.728
Dude, seriously?

33:29.763 --> 33:31.763
Travis, hey,

33:31.798 --> 33:33.164
where's your head at?

33:33.200 --> 33:34.833
Chris, let me see the slider now.

33:44.745 --> 33:45.777
(exhales)

33:48.749 --> 33:51.116
John: Yeah, that's the heat.

33:51.151 --> 33:52.717
Okay, Travis,

33:52.753 --> 33:54.018
let me see the cutter.

33:55.021 --> 33:55.954
(exhales)

34:02.996 --> 34:04.996
Dude, this is a joke, right?

34:07.202 --> 34:08.032
You suck.

34:08.068 --> 34:09.833
You're a freakin' embarrassment.

34:11.938 --> 34:13.804
Oh, hell no.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.873
Hey! Hey! Hey!

34:14.908 --> 34:15.940
Hey!

34:15.976 --> 34:18.710
Break it up! Break...
break... break it up!

34:18.745 --> 34:20.712
Break it up! What...

34:20.746 --> 34:21.913
Hey! Stop it! Stop it!

34:21.947 --> 34:24.149
Hey, what is wrong with you?

34:25.319 --> 34:26.684
You don't hit him!

34:26.719 --> 34:28.719
Chris, you're starting.

34:28.755 --> 34:30.822
Travis, take a lap. Cool down.

34:33.203 --> 34:35.760
Hey, you started it! I saw.

34:37.697 --> 34:39.130
I don't care what he said!

34:39.166 --> 34:40.697
You don't make it physical!

34:43.737 --> 34:44.636
Travis...

34:47.774 --> 34:48.706
You watch it.

34:50.275 --> 34:52.010
You know what? Get
off my field right now!

34:52.045 --> 34:53.043
Get off!

34:54.181 --> 34:55.112
What are you looking at?

34:55.148 --> 34:56.915
Get back to work! Come on!

34:59.052 --> 35:00.151
What the hell?

35:00.187 --> 35:03.888
I just spent the past hour
on the phone with Gavin Bowers

35:03.924 --> 35:05.924
begging him to give us even a dime!

35:05.959 --> 35:07.826
He crossed the line.

35:07.861 --> 35:08.927
I had to defend myself.

35:08.962 --> 35:09.961
Are you kidding me?

35:09.996 --> 35:12.764
I handed you a sure
thing, and you blew it.

35:12.799 --> 35:14.933
Well, you did put me
in a terrible position.

35:15.001 --> 35:16.868
It was harmless flirting.

35:16.903 --> 35:18.703
How would you know?

35:18.738 --> 35:21.706
No boss has ever told
you to sex yourself up

35:21.741 --> 35:22.707
to snag a donor.

35:22.742 --> 35:24.809
And if they did, I would do so happily.

35:24.845 --> 35:27.679
Oh, sure, easy for you to say,

35:27.714 --> 35:28.880
since that's never
actually gonna happen.

35:28.915 --> 35:32.784
And why do we even accept
money from scumbags like Bowers?

35:32.819 --> 35:35.720
Don't we owe it to our
kids to set a good example?

35:35.755 --> 35:39.057
What we owe them are
facilities and equipment

35:39.092 --> 35:40.758
and opportunities to succeed,

35:40.794 --> 35:43.027
which they won't have if we reject money

35:43.063 --> 35:45.163
from every mildly offensive jerk.

35:45.198 --> 35:47.699
You want to play with the big boys?

35:48.735 --> 35:50.969
Then get with the program.

35:55.075 --> 35:56.040
(sighs)

36:05.018 --> 36:06.784
I was trying to follow your advice

36:06.820 --> 36:07.952
in adding more detailed gradient.

36:07.988 --> 36:09.954
Let the work speak for itself.

36:12.759 --> 36:13.858
Contour's on point

36:13.894 --> 36:16.694
and the letters feel organic
like everything's in motion.

36:18.798 --> 36:19.797
Solid job.

36:19.833 --> 36:22.700
Really? Oh, awesome. Thank you.

36:22.736 --> 36:24.135
I'm gonna grab some
food. Be back in an hour.

36:24.170 --> 36:25.737
I'll hold down the fort.

36:25.772 --> 36:28.806
Oh, and can you add 30
minutes to my 3:00 on Friday?

36:28.842 --> 36:30.708
That sleeve is gonna take
longer than I thought.

36:30.744 --> 36:31.709
You got it.

36:50.163 --> 36:51.963
What the...

37:07.948 --> 37:08.880
Hey.

37:12.819 --> 37:15.820
Look, I... I was going to tell you.

37:18.892 --> 37:20.658
No, that's crazy!

37:21.728 --> 37:22.827
Emmett is just a friend.

37:25.832 --> 37:27.832
But not anymore, okay?

37:27.867 --> 37:29.801
I was just helping him
with an art project!

37:32.772 --> 37:34.806
I... I didn't see it
like that, I promise.

37:36.643 --> 37:38.109
Because you were so stressed

37:38.144 --> 37:41.079
about the team and going to regionals!

37:44.784 --> 37:46.017
Travis, wait!

37:55.095 --> 37:57.629
You showed your tattoo to Travis?

38:00.133 --> 38:02.634
What did you do, wave it in his face?

38:12.272 --> 38:13.044
I know that.

38:13.079 --> 38:16.814
I was waiting to tell
him until after regionals!

38:19.786 --> 38:20.985
Look me in the eye and tell me that

38:21.021 --> 38:23.788
this wasn't a plan to try
and get between me and Travis.

38:24.858 --> 38:25.923
Well, I don't know!

38:30.229 --> 38:31.896
And that's all this was about?

38:35.001 --> 38:36.668
(scoffs)

38:42.809 --> 38:45.076
When I came home from China, you said...

38:49.182 --> 38:52.083
Was any part of this to try
and get back together with me?

39:04.030 --> 39:07.098
As long as I'm with Travis,
you and I can't be friends.

39:14.107 --> 39:18.910
All we're asking for is
equal justice and respect.

39:18.945 --> 39:20.044
Miss Watkins, if you don't mind.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.080
Thank you.

39:22.115 --> 39:24.082
Although the administration
supports your right to

39:24.117 --> 39:26.951
peacefully protest, it's
against school regulations

39:26.986 --> 39:29.020
for students to camp out overnight.

39:29.055 --> 39:30.955
That's for your own safety.

39:30.990 --> 39:33.858
If you truly cared about our safety,

39:33.893 --> 39:36.170
you'd expel those guys
who put the cotton balls

39:36.171 --> 39:37.171
in front of our building.

39:37.196 --> 39:38.830
- Students: Yeah!
- That's right.

39:38.865 --> 39:40.798
Those young men have been punished.

39:40.834 --> 39:41.966
Not enough.

39:42.001 --> 39:44.802
The laws on this campus
don't govern everyone fairly.

39:44.838 --> 39:46.971
Black and white students
are treated differently.

39:47.006 --> 39:48.973
I understand your frustration,

39:49.008 --> 39:51.876
but their punishment had
nothing to do with race.

39:51.911 --> 39:52.910
Students: Oh, surprise!

39:52.946 --> 39:54.846
If you really believe that,

39:54.881 --> 39:55.980
then you're a part of the problem.

39:56.015 --> 39:57.782
Students: Yeah! You're the problem! You!

39:58.985 --> 40:00.918
Look, why don't we go to my office

40:00.954 --> 40:02.820
and discuss things calmly?

40:02.856 --> 40:04.856
You want us behind closed doors

40:04.891 --> 40:05.890
so you can shut us down.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.792
No way!

40:07.827 --> 40:09.794
Not unless you guarantee us

40:09.829 --> 40:11.763
the cotton ballers will be expelled.

40:11.798 --> 40:13.731
- That's right.
- As I have said,

40:13.767 --> 40:14.832
my hands are tied.

40:14.868 --> 40:16.701
That's a load of crap!

40:16.736 --> 40:18.836
I'm so sick and tired of all of this.

40:18.872 --> 40:20.138
The laws on campus suck

40:20.173 --> 40:21.739
and they need to change.

40:21.775 --> 40:23.708
- You need to do something!
- You need to watch your tone.

40:23.743 --> 40:25.176
Don't tell me to watch my tone.

40:25.211 --> 40:26.744
If you don't get this,

40:26.780 --> 40:28.146
- you need to step down.
- Calm down.

40:28.181 --> 40:30.715
And don't tell me to calm down.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.183
Maybe you should be a
little bit more upset!

40:32.218 --> 40:34.185
All right, you know what,
you and your friends,

40:34.220 --> 40:36.187
you need to pack up your things

40:36.222 --> 40:37.855
and go home now!

40:37.891 --> 40:39.791
We won't go!

40:39.826 --> 40:42.160
Students: We won't go! We won't go!

40:42.195 --> 40:43.194
- We won't go!
- All right!

40:43.229 --> 40:46.130
We won't go! We won't go!

40:46.166 --> 40:48.166
We won't go! We won't go!

40:48.201 --> 40:50.201
We won't go! We won't go!

40:50.236 --> 40:51.836
- All right, that's enough!
- We won't go!

40:51.871 --> 40:54.172
- We won't go! We won't go!
- Hey!

40:54.207 --> 40:55.673
- Hey!
- We won't go!

40:55.708 --> 40:56.741
- Hey!
- Hey!

40:56.776 --> 40:57.775
- What are you doing?
- Let her go!

40:57.811 --> 40:59.744
We're just standing here! Hey!

40:59.779 --> 41:00.711
I'm okay.

41:05.185 --> 41:06.684
We won't go!

41:06.719 --> 41:08.719
Students: We won't go! We won't go!

41:08.755 --> 41:09.821
We won't go!

41:09.856 --> 41:11.789
We won't go! We won't go!

41:11.825 --> 41:14.125
We won't go! We won't go!

41:14.160 --> 41:15.159
We won't go!

41:15.195 --> 41:17.128
We won't go! We won't go!

41:17.197 --> 41:19.730
We won't go! We won't go!

41:19.766 --> 41:21.766
We won't go! We won't go!

41:21.801 --> 41:23.701
We won't go! We won't go!
