WEBVTT

00:20.000 --> 00:22.834
Patrol four.
Heading into the holding pen.

01:14.019 --> 01:16.454
This is patrol four. I have uh

01:16.588 --> 01:20.355
- visual breach on unit 103.
- Sir?

01:20.559 --> 01:22.289
What do the monitors show?

01:23.061 --> 01:24.791
The camera feed is offline.

01:24.996 --> 01:26.988
We need visual confirmation.

01:28.867 --> 01:31.234
There's no margin for error here.

01:31.303 --> 01:32.271
Yes, sir.

01:32.738 --> 01:34.730
Can you verify that the cell is empty?

01:34.940 --> 01:36.431
Stand by.

01:55.826 --> 01:57.351
Cell is empty.

01:58.195 --> 02:00.061
- Stand by.
- Copy that.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.897
Do we have a problem here?

02:05.169 --> 02:09.470
Get Talbot down here ASAP. Now!

02:09.940 --> 02:12.910
Stand your ground.
Back up is en route.

05:07.012 --> 05:08.503
It's all for show.

05:08.647 --> 05:10.740
Don't worry we've all gone through this.

05:11.215 --> 05:14.208
Soon, we'll be sisters.

05:15.486 --> 05:18.012
As you know this is pledge week

05:18.423 --> 05:21.723
and these pathetic losers
are what's left of the even more

05:21.826 --> 05:24.694
pathetic losers who rushed
our hallowed sorority,

05:24.862 --> 05:28.697
Tau Omega Sigma.
We are the beginning and the end.

05:28.866 --> 05:31.631
The beginning and the end.

05:31.736 --> 05:33.500
These girls are the last three,

05:33.671 --> 05:37.108
but to be one of us they
have to go through a final trial.

05:37.241 --> 05:37.901
Girls.

05:48.385 --> 05:53.050
Are you stupid bitches
or are you TOS wolves?

06:00.430 --> 06:03.764
It's time for the wrestling match.
Grease those pigs up!

06:03.867 --> 06:06.166
Yeah!

06:06.336 --> 06:08.202
Can't hear you!

06:11.975 --> 06:12.999
Strip!

06:23.919 --> 06:28.914
The rules of the game are simple.
The first girl to get dunked loses.

06:29.125 --> 06:31.060
May the best girl win!

06:40.369 --> 06:41.769
Take her down!

07:01.690 --> 07:03.852
Hey! There's cops outside!

07:06.061 --> 07:08.895
Where are you guys going?
Wait. We're not done here.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.861
How dare the cops
intrude on our little soiree.

07:42.896 --> 07:47.925
You just destroyed
and five million dollar investment.

07:49.737 --> 07:53.139
And I would do it again if I had to.
Sir.

07:55.209 --> 07:58.577
Right answer.
There's a convoy.

07:59.213 --> 08:02.478
Three more investments
are on their way here.

08:02.615 --> 08:06.643
I need you to divert it.
While we assess our situation.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.654
This whole facility
has been compromised.

08:12.759 --> 08:17.254
Contact me when you get there.
I'll have more information for you.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.498
Yes, sir.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.710
- Can I help you, officers?
- We've had noise complaints.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.443
Well, it's a party.
There's bound to be a little noise.

08:38.616 --> 08:41.553
A little noise is okay. A lot is not.

08:41.686 --> 08:43.484
Looks like there is alcohol
on the premises.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.284
- Is everyone here over the age of 21?
- Gimmie a light.

08:46.358 --> 08:50.557
Of course. We don't condone
underage drinking, officers.

08:50.662 --> 08:52.927
Sure you don't. How old are you?

08:54.266 --> 08:55.199
I'm 21.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.700
How about you showing me
your drivers license.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.669
Let's go.

09:01.973 --> 09:02.804
HEY!

09:02.974 --> 09:04.408
You stay right there.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.643
Time to go.

09:21.659 --> 09:22.752
There they are.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.619
Pull along side.

09:43.813 --> 09:47.079
- Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir. Corporal Barnes.

09:47.884 --> 09:51.787
- Corporal, do you know who I am?
- Sir, yes sir. Captain Talbot, sir.

09:51.855 --> 09:53.483
Good.
There's been a change of plans.

09:53.656 --> 09:54.680
Yes, sir.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.798
Sir, I'm with the shipment.

10:01.931 --> 10:06.130
Good. The closest safe location
has been determined to be here

10:06.703 --> 10:08.638
the Elkwood detention facility.

10:08.771 --> 10:10.933
It has a large underground garage

10:11.074 --> 10:15.774
and it's run by a man
we can count on to be discrete.

10:15.879 --> 10:17.608
I'll put a call into him.

10:17.779 --> 10:19.771
You take the vehicles
over there and park.

10:19.848 --> 10:22.875
I'll be in touch. LaFranco out.

10:30.893 --> 10:32.623
Everything okay, boss?

10:34.196 --> 10:35.755
Yeah, let's hope so.

10:35.831 --> 10:38.198
Corporal Barnes
I need you to follow us.

10:38.367 --> 10:39.266
Sir.

10:41.837 --> 10:43.032
Move it!

11:04.659 --> 11:05.490
Where the hell is my car?

11:05.660 --> 11:06.650
Right there.

11:06.794 --> 11:07.853
Oh crap, quick!

11:09.563 --> 11:10.758
Hurry! Come on!

11:14.702 --> 11:15.897
Are you sure?

11:16.604 --> 11:19.438
Frenemies don't let frenemies
get behind the wheel.

11:19.807 --> 11:20.740
What?

11:20.808 --> 11:23.437
I said -are you okay to drive?

11:23.577 --> 11:27.343
Jeeze. Yell much? Yeah,
I'm okay. Get your ass in the car.

11:28.415 --> 11:29.815
Please, Pippi. Come on.

11:31.751 --> 11:32.775
Come on!

11:34.854 --> 11:36.914
Are you bitches ready to have fun?

11:43.029 --> 11:44.088
Stay here.

11:45.098 --> 11:46.361
Let's go now.

11:48.768 --> 11:52.432
- Did I do that?
- Yeah, you did that.

11:57.811 --> 12:01.076
Elkwood Detention Facility-Los Angeles ------------

12:16.195 --> 12:17.663
Warden Lewis.

12:18.764 --> 12:19.993
Yes?

12:20.899 --> 12:22.197
Governor.

12:23.002 --> 12:24.368
Yes, sir.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.134
I see.

12:28.474 --> 12:29.942
I understand.

12:30.776 --> 12:32.836
Every courtesy will be extended.

12:33.912 --> 12:34.879
Yes, sir.

12:40.685 --> 12:41.778
- Armstrong?
- Yes, sir.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.479
We'll be having some guests.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.711
Okay.

12:44.956 --> 12:46.515
Can you notify the front gate?

12:46.657 --> 12:47.716
Right away, sir.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.435
I'm here in front of the home where
Mr. MacMoran is currently being held -

12:59.570 --> 13:03.632
after a major manhunt
that lasted several weeks. -

13:03.908 --> 13:05.672
It is almost ten years to the day

13:05.777 --> 13:09.269
when Mr. MacMoran had
committed the rape and murder

13:09.446 --> 13:13.884
of almost half a dozen nurses
at a prominent assisted living facility.

13:14.351 --> 13:17.913
At this hour it is not known
where Mr. MacMoran will be taken -

13:18.088 --> 13:21.752
other than his reign of terror
is officially over. -

13:24.428 --> 13:26.294
Well, well, well.

13:27.798 --> 13:30.632
If it isn't the infamous Doyle MacMoran.

13:31.168 --> 13:32.659
I guess if I was a young girl I'd be

13:32.769 --> 13:35.762
quaking in my little bunny
slippers right about now.

13:38.809 --> 13:39.970
But I'm not.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.610
I'm a man.

13:43.813 --> 13:45.509
I'm a grown man.

13:46.082 --> 13:49.018
I guess you don't mess
with grown men too much, do you?

13:49.985 --> 13:51.954
Too much of a challenge.

13:58.994 --> 14:00.758
Ah, Doyle.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.198
You know there's a lot
of families out there

14:04.366 --> 14:08.497
that would rest easier
if you would just cooperate.

14:10.039 --> 14:12.804
Might even take the death
penalty right off the table.

14:12.875 --> 14:16.777
Think about it. Death. Life.

14:17.545 --> 14:19.571
Life in prison ain't that bad.

14:20.548 --> 14:24.280
Gives you lots of time
to reflect on what you've done.

14:24.786 --> 14:29.281
Repent.
Hell, write a book I don't care.

14:30.925 --> 14:36.125
All you have to do
is tell us where the bodies are buried.

14:38.266 --> 14:45.605
You ask me for a favor
yet you can't even use the magic word.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.476
The magic...?

14:50.011 --> 14:52.707
You think I'm going to say please
and thank you to you, dirtbag?

14:52.813 --> 14:54.714
You got another thing coming. You...

14:56.917 --> 15:00.354
A good mother teaches every young
gentleman proper manners.

15:02.623 --> 15:05.525
Your momma was no lady I see.

15:09.930 --> 15:12.126
What about you, Doyle? Hmm?

15:13.767 --> 15:15.861
Your momma teach you that?

15:16.670 --> 15:20.129
Or was she too busy with one of your many
'uncles'?

15:23.410 --> 15:25.878
I don't remember much about my momma.

15:27.413 --> 15:30.815
Aside from bludgeoning her
in her bed when I was nine.

15:33.486 --> 15:36.547
So why don't you just put me in the chair
and fry me up real good

15:36.722 --> 15:39.590
because I ain't going
to tell you a damn thing.

15:41.227 --> 15:44.356
Unless, of course,
you use the magic word.

15:47.567 --> 15:48.660
Alright.

15:49.702 --> 15:52.035
I guess we'll just have
to figure out another

15:52.271 --> 15:54.137
way to loosen your tongue.

16:03.315 --> 16:05.614
Tell Lewis I'll be back tomorrow.

16:05.850 --> 16:09.480
Put that scumbag in
the smallest cell you've got.

16:10.755 --> 16:12.189
You've got it, sir.

16:29.674 --> 16:31.108
Can I help you?

16:32.410 --> 16:34.674
Please inform
Warden Lewis that we are here.

16:34.745 --> 16:35.940
And we are?

16:42.419 --> 16:45.184
This is Stevens at the gate.
We have visitors.

16:45.322 --> 16:47.655
Let them through.
Warden gave the go ahead.

16:47.758 --> 16:49.727
I understand.

16:50.127 --> 16:51.959
Just head towards your left.

17:41.743 --> 17:43.268
Check it out.

17:43.779 --> 17:45.611
Hey, ladies.

17:46.448 --> 17:53.981
A pretty girl is like a melody
that haunts you night and day.

17:54.189 --> 17:57.318
Turn around and shut up.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.724
I don't care what he says.
I think you've got a beautiful voice.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.800
Oh, you sweet man.

18:06.468 --> 18:11.429
- Just like the strain of a happy refrain -
- Move it.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.667
She'll come upon like a marathon

18:14.843 --> 18:16.401
- and dance through your brain.
- Let's go.

18:16.544 --> 18:18.445
Alright, ladies. Follow me.

18:24.952 --> 18:26.511
Ladies.

18:30.925 --> 18:33.622
Oh my god, it smells like pee.

18:42.403 --> 18:43.268
Hey!

18:43.671 --> 18:44.798
You like that?

18:56.816 --> 18:58.148
Hey, cutie.

19:00.920 --> 19:04.084
- I'm talking to you.
- Yeah, and your breath really stinks.

19:04.324 --> 19:06.088
You sure it's not your upper lip?

19:06.192 --> 19:08.627
At least I don't need to wax the 'stash.

19:11.297 --> 19:14.392
Inside please. Inside.

19:14.968 --> 19:17.699
Let go. Let go of me.
Step inside.

19:18.705 --> 19:22.107
No. No, no. Thank you. Let go.

19:22.242 --> 19:23.403
Thank you.

19:24.143 --> 19:25.133
Hey!

19:26.912 --> 19:28.744
Look, are you causing trouble?

19:28.981 --> 19:30.677
Because I really hate trouble.

19:30.783 --> 19:34.083
I'm not causing any trouble.
No, no trouble here.

19:34.219 --> 19:38.520
In fact, we're all just getting
to be really, really good pals.

19:38.590 --> 19:41.719
Where's the trouble?
It's my favorite place to be.

19:41.794 --> 19:44.764
Boom, Boom, Boom.

19:44.897 --> 19:46.195
Oh, whatever.

19:55.741 --> 19:56.731
Get off.

19:56.942 --> 19:58.739
Leave her alone.

19:59.377 --> 20:01.903
Oh yeah? Make me, pipsqueak.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.283
Oh my god.

20:08.386 --> 20:10.878
You feel so good.

20:14.792 --> 20:16.988
Like a million little bunny rabbits.

20:17.195 --> 20:21.326
- Yeah? You're a little bunny rabbit.
- You think so?

20:21.399 --> 20:22.992
- Yes.
- I love bunny rabbits.

20:23.201 --> 20:24.567
- Do you?
- Yes!

20:24.669 --> 20:26.900
- Lets talk about bunny rabbits.
- OK!

20:28.039 --> 20:30.599
- Do you have a fuzzy little tail?
- Sometimes, yeah.

20:30.741 --> 20:33.801
Speaking of fuzzy little tails
have you met my friend?

20:35.579 --> 20:37.047
I could have taken her.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.444
Sure you could have.

20:39.983 --> 20:41.747
I shouldn't even be here.

20:41.918 --> 20:43.113
None of us should.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.689
We didn't even do anything aside
from being in the car.

20:45.822 --> 20:48.223
You're either a passenger or a driver.

20:48.391 --> 20:51.725
Me? I prefer being behind the wheel.

21:05.876 --> 21:07.070
Watch it!

21:07.510 --> 21:08.842
There's hardly any room.

21:08.911 --> 21:10.539
Well, be more careful.

21:55.590 --> 21:57.718
I know you're all wondering
what's going on.

21:58.793 --> 22:02.491
Truth is... I'm not sure.

22:02.597 --> 22:04.589
So, we stay put for now.

22:04.866 --> 22:08.394
I want you to temporarily disable
the security cameras and gear up.

22:08.736 --> 22:10.432
We may be guests,

22:10.738 --> 22:13.230
but we can't let anyone
interfere with our mission.

22:13.641 --> 22:15.541
- Understood?
- YES, SIR!

22:16.310 --> 22:18.176
Let's get to work then. File out.

22:20.981 --> 22:22.574
Ignacio, come with me.

22:29.022 --> 22:30.456
Looking good.

22:40.701 --> 22:42.795
I presume you know what this is for.

22:46.340 --> 22:47.831
If something happens.

22:47.975 --> 22:56.508
Like the loss of cargo
then we are to... Boom.

22:56.816 --> 22:59.718
Destroy all evidence including the trucks.

22:59.852 --> 23:00.683
Good.

23:01.187 --> 23:04.157
I need to make a call to the man.
Hold tight until I get back.

23:16.502 --> 23:17.401
Damn it.

23:20.439 --> 23:21.134
What?

23:22.274 --> 23:23.502
You're kidding.

23:24.542 --> 23:26.773
Do nothing. For now.

23:27.979 --> 23:29.777
What else could possibly go wrong?

23:31.316 --> 23:34.718
Sergeant, tonight we find ourselves
between a rock and a hard place.

23:34.786 --> 23:36.311
I don't understand.

23:36.688 --> 23:38.987
And that's a beautiful thing, trust me.

23:39.424 --> 23:46.354
Besides this idiot we have some
other new friends under our roof tonight.

23:46.698 --> 23:48.826
No less dangerous however.

23:50.869 --> 23:54.067
I need you to send your best man
down below.

23:54.305 --> 23:56.365
And he's to report only.

23:56.541 --> 24:00.341
Do not engage.
Keep this in our circle of trust.

24:00.477 --> 24:05.745
Are guests are connected at levels way
beyond our pay grade so tread lightly.

24:06.717 --> 24:08.709
Yes, sir. I'll send Cooper down.

24:08.852 --> 24:09.842
Alright.

24:18.929 --> 24:19.828
Captain. -

24:20.497 --> 24:22.090
The cargo is secure, sir.

24:22.499 --> 24:24.900
Good. Very good. -

24:24.968 --> 24:27.335
Unfortunately, we've had another breach. -

24:27.671 --> 24:29.663
I don't know the extent of it yet, -

24:30.107 --> 24:35.067
but as you're aware the smallest
of the small can be catastrophic. -

24:35.178 --> 24:37.670
Talbot, I need you again. -

24:38.715 --> 24:43.119
Get some of your men together.
You're going hunting. -

24:53.062 --> 24:54.826
You're in charge while I'm gone.

24:54.931 --> 24:56.126
Sir?

24:56.332 --> 24:58.665
Something is out there that shouldn't be.

24:59.168 --> 25:01.467
You know what to do
if worse comes to worse.

25:01.738 --> 25:03.297
Boom.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.329
Okay.

25:05.874 --> 25:06.898
See you soon.

25:31.566 --> 25:33.728
Hey, mom.
We're gonna get in the Jacuzzi.

25:33.835 --> 25:36.168
Okay, baby. Don't stay too long.

25:36.338 --> 25:38.068
You'll shrivel up like prunes.

25:50.284 --> 25:51.582
Hey.

25:53.854 --> 25:54.981
Hey.

26:01.662 --> 26:05.724
- Feels so good.
- Yeah, it's great.

26:07.535 --> 26:09.231
Does your mom know that-

26:09.336 --> 26:12.067
Boys are coming over later!

26:13.873 --> 26:17.742
She would have to be sober for
at least minute to even notice.

26:17.811 --> 26:19.973
She's going be passed
out in twenty. You'll see.

26:20.180 --> 26:23.241
You're so lucky.
I wish my mom was like that.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.552
She's all up in my grill 24/7.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.622
Really? I'm lucky?

26:29.322 --> 26:30.585
Yeah, you are.

26:32.225 --> 26:33.693
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.092
- Yeah?
- Oh, so lucky.

26:43.136 --> 26:46.265
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what was that?

26:46.806 --> 26:47.898
I don't know.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.447
This ain't nothing, pretty boy.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.353
This is just a slight detour

27:06.491 --> 27:09.723
before you get dropped in a big,
black hole for the rest of your life.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.695
You ever wonder
what hell on Earth is like?

27:31.282 --> 27:32.773
Not interested?.

27:34.151 --> 27:35.813
Only in getting out of here.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.360
You don't seem like the rah-rah type.

27:42.593 --> 27:44.858
You finally noticed that, did you?

27:49.901 --> 27:51.096
Sorry.

27:52.803 --> 27:55.136
Sarcasm is my natural default.

27:55.873 --> 27:56.805
You think?

27:59.743 --> 28:02.770
I thought if I pushed myself
into doing something

28:03.046 --> 28:09.418
from what I know then
maybe I'd grow as a person.

28:11.321 --> 28:14.553
Yeah, I hear jail is good for that.

28:48.724 --> 28:50.784
Evening, ladies.

29:15.817 --> 29:16.807
Hey.

29:17.385 --> 29:20.981
Isn't that the guy that killed all
those chicks about ten years ago?

29:21.189 --> 29:22.213
Put them up.

29:24.759 --> 29:25.988
I don't know.

29:26.728 --> 29:29.493
Sort of looks like my cousin Bob.

29:30.665 --> 29:32.691
Now there was a guy who could drink.

29:33.134 --> 29:34.864
He was good people though.

29:54.688 --> 29:56.884
Keep heading on the five
until you get to the two.

29:57.057 --> 29:58.047
Copy that, sir.

30:04.564 --> 30:07.466
You and you. Position yourself
by the prison entrance.

30:07.601 --> 30:09.263
You sure those things can't escape?

30:09.369 --> 30:13.271
It's reinforced steel.
No way they can get out.

30:13.406 --> 30:16.968
They're tough,
but they ain't that tough. Let's go.

30:25.785 --> 30:26.809
Sir,

30:27.486 --> 30:30.081
the Hummer has left the grounds,
but there are four men left.

30:30.256 --> 30:32.816
Fully armed with automatic weapons.

30:33.325 --> 30:38.491
Sir, our guests seem to be heavily armed.
The count is four individuals.

30:38.564 --> 30:41.033
Okay,
Sergeant I want you to talk to them,

30:41.267 --> 30:42.565
but go slow.

30:42.968 --> 30:45.403
Assess the situation and report back to me.

30:45.571 --> 30:46.698
Affirmative.

30:46.805 --> 30:49.206
I'll call you back after I've made contact.

30:50.141 --> 30:52.576
Cooper, come with me.

31:05.757 --> 31:07.419
Woah, woah, woah.

31:07.892 --> 31:09.554
Lower your weapons.

31:09.794 --> 31:13.287
Gentlemen, this is our house
and you are our guests.

31:14.299 --> 31:17.758
Sorry, sir. We cannot allow you to pass.
Orders.

31:18.570 --> 31:21.698
Okay, can I speak to
whoever is in charge then.

31:27.744 --> 31:29.212
Can I help you?

31:29.413 --> 31:31.143
I'm Sergeant Armstrong.

31:31.882 --> 31:36.479
Warden Lewis sent me here to make sure
that you were being taken care of.

31:37.688 --> 31:41.250
Well, you can tell the Warden that
we really appreciate his hospitality,

31:42.059 --> 31:44.756
but we don't need anything at the moment.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.331
Oh. Well, I'm glad.

31:47.498 --> 31:49.990
And may I ask whom I'm speaking to.

31:50.567 --> 31:55.664
Corporal Ignacio. Department of Internal
- Homeland Security.

31:55.905 --> 31:57.806
Internal-Homeland Security?

31:59.208 --> 32:01.143
What is this? Some kind of joke?

32:01.544 --> 32:03.638
I don't want to appear rude,

32:04.013 --> 32:10.112
but we are really going to need you
to leave this immediate area.

32:12.655 --> 32:14.021
Okay, what exactly is in that truck?

32:14.123 --> 32:16.854
That's a need to know situation, sir.

32:20.796 --> 32:22.458
You need to get back inside.

32:22.565 --> 32:24.693
Come with me. Come on! Let's go!

32:25.601 --> 32:28.730
Cooper, I want you to go to Warden Lewis
and tell him exactly what's going on.

32:28.804 --> 32:29.827
I'm going to check this out myself, okay?

32:30.005 --> 32:30.836
Yes, sir.

32:35.477 --> 32:38.140
You see one of those things
you don't hesitate to shoot it.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.598
What are you carrying
in these vehicles, Corporal?

33:04.171 --> 33:06.970
Is that an explosive device in our jail?

33:07.241 --> 33:08.607
Do you know what that
would do down here?

33:08.776 --> 33:10.369
Step away. Step away!

33:23.857 --> 33:24.847
We need to call Talbot!

33:38.438 --> 33:40.236
What is going on? I heard gunfire.

33:40.406 --> 33:42.705
The cargo trucks...
there's something inside of them.

33:42.842 --> 33:43.866
What do you mean? Inside.

33:44.043 --> 33:46.239
I can't even say.
It's some kind of animal.

33:48.481 --> 33:51.280
Code red. Code red.
I want a full assembly.

33:53.853 --> 33:54.821
Lock down C Block!

34:01.294 --> 34:02.853
Stun batons aren't
going to be enough, sir.

34:02.962 --> 34:04.123
We're going to need
something more powerful.

34:04.230 --> 34:07.860
Do I have to remind you
we're in a correction facility full of criminals?

34:08.434 --> 34:10.426
We're not allowed anything more powerful.

34:10.603 --> 34:11.695
Warden Lewis, come in.

34:12.237 --> 34:14.900
We have a situation down here
I can't even begin to explain.

34:17.042 --> 34:18.168
Oh Jesus! Come on!

34:21.880 --> 34:23.781
Come on! Jesus please!

35:11.495 --> 35:12.758
I don't feel so good.

35:19.637 --> 35:21.332
Oh, gross.

35:22.072 --> 35:24.871
She's coming down
off of whatever she was on.

35:25.308 --> 35:26.537
Oh, great.

35:32.515 --> 35:34.074
You don't have any idea what's going on?

35:34.250 --> 35:37.277
None. All the cameras have been
disabled in that sector.

35:37.854 --> 35:39.345
I'm coming down.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.485
Get back to your post.

35:41.691 --> 35:43.387
I need eyes on the situation.

35:44.794 --> 35:47.787
Sir? We're assembled.
Shall we continue?

35:47.964 --> 35:49.159
Proceed with caution.

35:49.366 --> 35:51.699
We don't have any idea
what we're dealing with.

35:51.868 --> 35:53.166
I'll be down in five.

35:53.837 --> 35:55.031
10-4.

35:55.804 --> 35:57.238
Okay, men. We're going to move out.

35:57.306 --> 36:02.040
RUN! Run, run, run, run!
Close the doors.

36:02.711 --> 36:06.113
- Close them!
- Sir? What the hell is going on?

36:10.486 --> 36:11.419
What?

36:16.191 --> 36:18.057
Is that? Is that a dinosaur?

36:22.898 --> 36:24.764
Run! Go, go, go!

36:30.738 --> 36:32.934
Come on, you bastard. Come on!

36:56.230 --> 37:00.429
Go, go, go! Run, run, run! Go, go, go!

37:23.824 --> 37:25.258
What's going on?

37:26.793 --> 37:27.886
Hey!

38:01.494 --> 38:02.393
What the -?

38:13.371 --> 38:14.839
No, no.

38:25.583 --> 38:29.418
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!

38:41.866 --> 38:43.391
Let's go. Got to get out of here.

38:45.802 --> 38:48.863
Shhh. Go, go, go. Come on, come on!

38:53.377 --> 38:54.367
What the -?

39:00.918 --> 39:05.049
Now, normally
I would say that's a pretty good thing.

39:13.797 --> 39:14.765
Nope.

39:15.766 --> 39:18.235
Not a good thing. Not at all.

39:21.871 --> 39:23.032
Something is wrong.

39:30.246 --> 39:32.078
- Hi.
- Look, stay back.

39:33.583 --> 39:35.074
Look, I'm serious!
It's for your own good.

39:35.251 --> 39:36.844
- What about him?
- Hey, there.

39:40.556 --> 39:41.546
Come on!

39:43.125 --> 39:44.115
Okay.

39:51.701 --> 39:54.727
What temperature do you think
bacon gets extra crispy?

39:56.838 --> 39:59.706
Hey! Leave him alone.

40:01.843 --> 40:04.711
- What?
- She said leave him alone.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.586
What's the magic word?

40:15.724 --> 40:16.714
Please.

40:17.559 --> 40:19.027
That's the one.

40:19.227 --> 40:21.594
The magic word
is let's get the hell out of here.

40:22.931 --> 40:25.366
That's more like a magic sentence,

40:25.700 --> 40:28.225
but she probably
wouldn't know the difference.

40:29.770 --> 40:30.703
I wouldn't go out there if I were you.

40:30.904 --> 40:32.668
Yeah? And why not?

40:32.806 --> 40:35.605
Let's consider our situation for a moment.

40:35.809 --> 40:39.610
A) We just heard a bunch of people
screaming and suddenly they are silent.

40:39.713 --> 40:43.741
B) The doors happen to open all
by themselves and the only guard was this guy.

40:44.151 --> 40:47.588
Who looked like
he was about to piss his pants.

40:47.988 --> 40:50.822
Does that really make+
you want to go wandering the halls?

40:51.525 --> 40:53.153
No, not really.

40:58.365 --> 41:00.129
What do you think is going on?

41:00.701 --> 41:05.866
Whatever it is I say we get out of here before
anyone figures out what's going on.

41:07.740 --> 41:09.641
No, no, no. Those are mine.

41:12.712 --> 41:15.238
So, you're going play warden now?

41:17.150 --> 41:18.448
No.

41:18.885 --> 41:21.719
You want to go? There's the door.

41:22.989 --> 41:23.684
Okay.

41:23.923 --> 41:28.190
- Don't you think we should -
- Shut up, Sarah. Let her go if she wants.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.128
Hi.

41:30.363 --> 41:31.558
I want to go too.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.662
- You want to go?
- We should go.

41:34.167 --> 41:35.759
I vote yes. We go.

41:36.501 --> 41:37.901
Let's go. Come on.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.640
Hey, Manny? You coming?

41:41.740 --> 41:43.675
Nah. I'm going to stay.

41:43.775 --> 41:45.676
What are you talking about?
We're a team. Let's go!

41:45.877 --> 41:49.609
Bear, I appreciate that,
but I'll be all right.

41:49.781 --> 41:52.979
I just don't move so good anymore,
you know?

41:53.585 --> 41:55.383
Enough with the chit-chat.

41:55.620 --> 41:58.749
Let's leave the warden with his keys
and his play things.

42:03.662 --> 42:04.721
Okay.

42:11.135 --> 42:11.966
I'm sorry.

42:13.304 --> 42:14.704
Enjoy your stay.

42:14.805 --> 42:16.467
Too da loo, gals.

42:18.743 --> 42:20.006
Bye, bye.

42:21.378 --> 42:27.841
It's a beautiful day for a walk.
And a talk...

42:41.232 --> 42:42.256
This is it.

42:51.941 --> 42:53.170
Captain. -

42:53.510 --> 42:54.705
We've tracked it down.

42:54.878 --> 42:57.245
Its location is smack dab
in the middle of suburbia.

42:57.313 --> 43:01.148
Do what you need to do.
Contain the situation. -

43:01.317 --> 43:06.688
No matter what.
Look at it this way... it's just a test run. -

43:06.923 --> 43:07.720
A what?

43:09.125 --> 43:11.185
What does he mean by 'test run'?

43:14.063 --> 43:18.193
Never mind that. You heard the man.
Come on. Let's move out.

43:23.672 --> 43:24.833
Keep your eyes open.

43:40.722 --> 43:41.553
Sir.

43:41.957 --> 43:42.947
Shhh.

44:24.332 --> 44:26.562
Cease fire! Cease fire!

44:29.803 --> 44:31.135
Sir, what are
we going to do about Brown?

44:32.272 --> 44:34.639
Tag him. The clean up crew will
take care of him.

44:34.708 --> 44:36.301
I thought we were the clean up crew.

44:36.443 --> 44:38.435
Jones is going to stay here
and tell them what happened.

44:38.612 --> 44:39.443
Sir?

44:39.746 --> 44:41.578
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open. Move!

44:41.715 --> 44:42.444
Yes, sir.

44:43.917 --> 44:45.579
We have to get it out of here.
It's too populated.

44:45.752 --> 44:47.744
Wait. Lead it away? How do you know
it's going to follow us?

44:47.821 --> 44:49.653
It's got the scent of us now.
You drive.

44:49.723 --> 44:52.659
I'm going to blast that son
of a bitch straight back to the stone age.

45:29.995 --> 45:31.088
Oh, god.

46:00.024 --> 46:03.222
I can only imagine what he is
going to do to those little cherries.

46:07.432 --> 46:08.365
What was that?

46:11.068 --> 46:13.128
I'm really freaking out right about now.

46:13.570 --> 46:14.469
Just keep moving.

46:14.538 --> 46:17.667
The important thing is that we get out of here
before they realize we're loose.

46:17.908 --> 46:19.536
Then it's just you and me.

46:23.914 --> 46:26.383
Oh, come on. You got to have heard that.

46:27.317 --> 46:29.115
Maybe we should go back.

46:29.252 --> 46:31.153
No. The hell with that. We just keep -

46:32.022 --> 46:33.217
Maybe you're right.

46:36.860 --> 46:38.385
Come on, come on. Move. MOVE!

46:44.767 --> 46:46.258
Oh my god. What do we do?

46:46.335 --> 46:48.099
I vote for being a quiet as possible.

46:48.270 --> 46:49.704
We need some kind of weapon.

46:50.706 --> 46:51.605
I got this.

46:51.707 --> 46:53.903
Yeah, and you already used
it on our friend here.

46:53.976 --> 46:55.842
One cartridge. One shot.

46:56.379 --> 46:57.278
Good job.

46:57.913 --> 46:59.541
Yeah, well I've got this.

47:00.149 --> 47:01.708
Has anyone tried the pay phone?

47:02.318 --> 47:03.115
Well?

47:03.185 --> 47:05.654
I guess I have to do everything myself.

47:06.155 --> 47:07.248
Open the door.

47:20.769 --> 47:21.828
Go ahead.

47:36.918 --> 47:37.783
- No!
- Come on. Shhh.

47:39.888 --> 47:41.652
Wait, wait!

47:51.331 --> 47:52.094
Close the door!

47:55.869 --> 47:57.201
Lock it!

47:57.371 --> 47:58.361
Oh my god.

48:24.932 --> 48:28.333
Woah! WOAH! Jesus!

48:36.809 --> 48:38.334
Did I do it?

48:39.378 --> 48:41.472
Oh my god. Thank you.

48:41.714 --> 48:43.580
I swear I'd give up drinking for life.

48:43.649 --> 48:46.312
Oh, god. Don't say that!

48:55.261 --> 48:56.285
Hello?

48:57.897 --> 49:01.526
Hello? Is anyone there?
Can you hear me?

49:02.834 --> 49:04.769
- Hello?
- Yes, we can hear you.

49:05.103 --> 49:05.729
Good.

49:05.871 --> 49:09.330
I'm Warden Lewis. I run this facility.

49:09.875 --> 49:10.934
What's your name?

49:11.710 --> 49:13.178
Pippi.

49:13.345 --> 49:15.712
Pippi. Well,
it's very nice to meet you, Pippi.

49:15.814 --> 49:18.215
I'm sorry it's under such
bizarre circumstances.

49:18.817 --> 49:19.785
No kidding.

49:22.020 --> 49:23.716
This is some kind of experiment, right?

49:23.855 --> 49:25.221
You people drugged us
and now you're trying

49:25.323 --> 49:27.656
to see how we react
to extreme hallucinations.

49:28.727 --> 49:30.992
I wish I could say that was true.

49:31.830 --> 49:34.663
There are no such thing
as dinosaurs anymore.

49:34.732 --> 49:35.461
Gimmie that.

49:35.566 --> 49:37.558
That was my general impression as well.

49:37.668 --> 49:38.465
But if we're all hallucinating then

49:38.602 --> 49:40.935
I guess we're having
the same shared experience.

49:41.705 --> 49:43.697
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm here in the main control room

49:43.807 --> 49:47.266
and some damage has
been done during the attack

49:47.378 --> 49:49.779
and I'm unable to get in contact
with the outside world,

49:50.514 --> 49:55.748
but not to worry someone will be
coming along looking for us sooner or later.

49:56.687 --> 49:59.623
In the meantime you just hang tight.
Are you safe there where you are?

49:59.890 --> 50:03.884
Yes. The doors are locked
and those things weren't able to get in.

50:04.128 --> 50:07.064
Good. How many people
are there with you?

50:08.231 --> 50:12.327
Five. Plus one of your men.
He's been... hurt.

50:12.669 --> 50:15.867
Hurt? How? How bad?

50:16.706 --> 50:18.766
Who is it?
Can you see the name plate?

50:19.309 --> 50:21.301
Armstrong. He's okay.

50:21.644 --> 50:23.909
One of the prisoners attacked
him with a taser.

50:24.747 --> 50:26.409
That's why he's unconscious.

50:26.583 --> 50:31.749
Okay. Okay. Well,
he should have a set of keys on him.

50:31.821 --> 50:34.586
Yeah, we got those.
That's why they weren't able to get in.

50:34.724 --> 50:37.250
Alright, good. You just hang tight.

50:37.460 --> 50:40.328
Alright? I'll see what
I can do to get us out of here.

50:40.563 --> 50:42.087
Call if anything comes up.

52:01.641 --> 52:02.700
Hey!

52:09.983 --> 52:12.646
Oh my god. I'm going to kill
that slut for selling me bad X.

52:12.819 --> 52:14.219
I swear I just saw dinosaurs back there.

52:14.287 --> 52:16.347
Oh, come on. You did see a dinosaur.

52:16.489 --> 52:18.651
What are you talking about?
Stop messing with me.

52:18.858 --> 52:20.656
I'm not messing with you.

52:21.494 --> 52:24.225
Would you stop pushing.
I don't feel good. I need to rest.

52:24.330 --> 52:25.730
We have to keep moving.

52:25.898 --> 52:29.528
If we don't we could end up as little
pieces of meat inside a dinosaur's stomach.

52:29.735 --> 52:31.169
Do you want that?

52:32.171 --> 52:34.663
- Okay. Just give me a second.
- We don't have a second.

52:36.208 --> 52:38.973
Shh. Shh.

52:40.045 --> 52:41.570
Hear that?

52:42.748 --> 52:44.979
That's not a bad trip, okay?

52:45.084 --> 52:51.285
That is death and it's about to knock
on our back door so please can we go now?

52:55.761 --> 52:57.024
NO!

52:57.463 --> 52:58.362
Please.

52:58.563 --> 53:01.965
For god sakes will you just please
go with me now.

53:02.133 --> 53:08.505
Okay? Walk. Walk. This way.
Come on. Please, please let's go.

53:10.641 --> 53:12.439
Fine. You're on your own.

53:34.965 --> 53:36.365
Pretty bunny.

53:55.385 --> 53:58.651
So, the plan is just to sit here and
hope someone comes to our rescue?

53:58.889 --> 54:02.223
Sounds reasonable to me.
What else can we do?

54:04.728 --> 54:05.661
What are you doing?

54:05.796 --> 54:08.765
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm taking charge.

54:10.466 --> 54:11.263
Damn it.

54:14.703 --> 54:15.693
Damn it.

54:16.305 --> 54:17.739
This place was built old school.

54:17.873 --> 54:20.308
Stone foundation
is messing with the signal.

54:22.211 --> 54:22.735
He said -

54:22.845 --> 54:25.337
I heard what he said Sarah.
Now shut it.

54:28.884 --> 54:29.977
Ha.

54:32.321 --> 54:34.813
What are you going to do?
Take our picture and post it online?

54:34.924 --> 54:36.256
No, idiot.

54:36.425 --> 54:38.519
There's still a payphone out there.
Remember?

54:38.694 --> 54:40.424
If it works we can let the warden know.

54:40.563 --> 54:42.030
Yeah? How's that going to help?

54:42.263 --> 54:44.323
Those are dinosaurs.

54:44.432 --> 54:46.060
This is a prison.

54:46.534 --> 54:49.766
I'd say we're all a little out
of our element right now.

54:49.904 --> 54:50.928
Whatever.

54:51.039 --> 54:52.974
You can go back to doing nothing
if you want to.

54:53.141 --> 54:54.541
Sarah, come here.

54:58.847 --> 55:00.372
I said come here.

55:02.817 --> 55:05.616
Are you a wolf or are you a little bitch?

55:07.055 --> 55:08.717
A wolf?

55:15.262 --> 55:17.356
I want you to use this
to peek down the hall.

55:17.531 --> 55:20.330
When the coast is clear
I'm going to use the phone.

55:23.103 --> 55:23.968
Me?

55:24.171 --> 55:27.767
Yes. You. Unlock it.

55:30.744 --> 55:32.235
You sure you want to do this?

55:32.412 --> 55:35.780
I think we all remember very
well what happened last time.

55:35.916 --> 55:40.320
That's why when Sarah says the coast
is clear you're going to lock that door.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.616
Oh, I'm going to do that am I?

55:42.756 --> 55:43.689
Yes.

55:44.491 --> 55:46.653
Sarah, you don't have
to do everything she tells you.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.092
Yes, she does.

55:57.870 --> 55:59.031
There you go.

56:46.051 --> 56:49.920
If I even see a hint of a dinosaur
I'm going to personally feed you to it.

57:01.332 --> 57:03.767
Good job. I knew you could both do it.

57:05.569 --> 57:06.628
Catch.

57:09.373 --> 57:10.773
Good job, idiot.

57:10.941 --> 57:13.877
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was
your job to use the phone.

57:14.578 --> 57:18.879
Come on. I just did my job.
She did hers. Now it's your turn.

57:19.683 --> 57:21.584
Don't look at me. Go on.
How hard can it be?

57:21.752 --> 57:23.618
I just locked the door.

57:29.460 --> 57:31.156
Does anyone have more quarters?

57:32.128 --> 57:34.120
We're not all as skilled as you.

57:34.430 --> 57:36.865
Hiding quarters where the sun don't shine.

57:36.933 --> 57:37.798
Fine.

57:51.814 --> 57:52.645
Got it.

57:55.852 --> 57:58.651
Great. It's not even a pay phone.

57:59.555 --> 58:01.717
Who has a credit card in a prison?

58:07.763 --> 58:08.128
No dial tone.

58:14.169 --> 58:15.603
It's in there. It's coming!

58:16.772 --> 58:19.742
- Oh my god, it's coming in here. Run!
- Go, go, go!

58:21.777 --> 58:22.608
Come on.

58:22.778 --> 58:24.508
Oh my god.

58:27.315 --> 58:28.374
I need more.

58:29.951 --> 58:32.113
It's okay. It's okay.

58:40.795 --> 58:42.730
Jesus!

58:47.401 --> 58:49.165
Come on, I need more.

58:57.845 --> 58:59.074
It's okay, it's okay.

58:59.480 --> 59:01.779
Be careful. We need to apply pressure.

59:13.694 --> 59:17.721
Quick! In here, in here. Come on.

59:23.002 --> 59:23.992
Yeah.

59:24.804 --> 59:28.400
Come on in.
You must be one of LaFranco's men.

59:28.575 --> 59:30.441
- How did you know?
- This is my house.

59:30.610 --> 59:32.101
It's my business to know.

59:32.846 --> 59:37.409
I was ordered to let you people in here
and now a lot of good men are dead.

59:38.151 --> 59:40.143
It would be nice to know why.

59:40.587 --> 59:42.249
I can't tell you.

59:44.157 --> 59:45.557
Understand?

59:46.226 --> 59:47.785
Orders.

59:48.927 --> 59:50.862
I lost men as well.

59:52.731 --> 59:56.133
Things have gotten
really complicated. Get it?

59:56.869 --> 01:00:00.965
Okay. You can't or won't tell me.
Fine.

01:00:02.074 --> 01:00:04.475
At least you can help me
rescue a few young girls.

01:00:10.883 --> 01:00:12.317
Hello? Are you still there?

01:00:12.451 --> 01:00:16.821
Uh. Yeah, yeah we're here,
but not for much longer.

01:00:17.556 --> 01:00:18.319
Is this Pippi?

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:21.360
No, it's Sarah.
We're helping out a friend.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.551
Please, please get here as soon as you can.

01:00:23.628 --> 01:00:25.392
If you don't hurry I think she's going to die.

01:00:25.563 --> 01:00:27.623
All right just stay calm.

01:00:27.932 --> 01:00:30.629
I think I figured out a way
to get you guys out of there.

01:00:32.436 --> 01:00:34.371
Now, we're going to lure the creatures

01:00:34.772 --> 01:00:38.300
out of the area and trap
them in the cell blocks.

01:00:38.476 --> 01:00:40.604
- Trap them? How?
- Now,

01:00:40.745 --> 01:00:43.010
I've restored the electrical system
here in the control room,

01:00:43.214 --> 01:00:44.648
but who knows how long it will hold up.

01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.513
How will we know the dinosaurs are gone?

01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:48.744
I'll be able to see it in the monitors.

01:00:49.253 --> 01:00:51.916
All right? Ready?

01:00:56.927 --> 01:00:57.792
Yes.

01:00:59.062 --> 01:01:00.325
All right.

01:01:00.797 --> 01:01:02.561
How many of those things are there?

01:01:03.466 --> 01:01:06.265
Three.
Let's do it before I change my mind.

01:01:06.469 --> 01:01:08.438
All right. Down the hall and to the left.

01:01:08.572 --> 01:01:09.267
Got it.

01:01:10.774 --> 01:01:13.175
You don't see anything
in those monitors of yours?

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:14.405
Nope.

01:01:16.446 --> 01:01:18.642
- Nope. Let's do it.
- Got it.

01:01:19.716 --> 01:01:20.547
Wait.

01:01:22.385 --> 01:01:24.286
I don't want to leave you unprotected.

01:01:24.788 --> 01:01:26.188
Just in case.

01:01:33.796 --> 01:01:34.627
All right.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.561
One.

01:01:42.238 --> 01:01:43.399
Two.

01:01:48.344 --> 01:01:50.779
Three! Go, go, go!

01:02:07.662 --> 01:02:08.721
Okay, I'm here.

01:02:09.597 --> 01:02:11.623
- Light it up!
- Got it.

01:02:13.768 --> 01:02:18.763
HEY! YEAH, COME ON YOU SONS
OF BITCHES! OVER HERE!

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:25.703
HEY! COME ON!

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:30.751
Come on, come on!

01:02:34.722 --> 01:02:37.157
RIGHT HERE!
I'M HERE! COME GET SOME!

01:02:38.426 --> 01:02:39.791
COME GET SOME!

01:02:47.434 --> 01:02:48.766
One dinosaur.

01:02:48.902 --> 01:02:50.803
Two dinosaurs.

01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:54.164
Where the hell is the third one?

01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:02.844
Go away, go away. Bad dinosaur.
Go away, go away, go away.

01:03:06.353 --> 01:03:10.916
It's night time and the dinosaurs
are sleeping and they

01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:15.152
don't want to eat me
because I don't taste nice.

01:03:18.064 --> 01:03:21.865
Go away. Go away!

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.675
Two coming your way, buddy.

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:30.638
They're here.

01:03:40.786 --> 01:03:41.651
HEY!

01:03:42.755 --> 01:03:46.886
Come get some! Yeah,
over here! Come get some.

01:03:50.128 --> 01:03:52.996
Come get some right here!
Oh, you can't see me?

01:03:53.198 --> 01:03:54.325
Right here!

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.332
Come get some!

01:04:07.779 --> 01:04:09.475
Go, go, go!

01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:10.805
Come on!

01:04:11.149 --> 01:04:13.050
Come on, come on, come on.

01:04:13.752 --> 01:04:16.119
You need to go straight down the hall
and then turn to the right.

01:04:16.354 --> 01:04:17.151
Hurry!

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:28.132
Now what?

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:29.564
Go up the ramp.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.599
This way.

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:33.601
Shut up! The damn things will hear you.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:35.172
Leave her alone.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.467
How's it going in there?

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:40.945
Can you hurry up with those doors?

01:04:50.154 --> 01:04:53.420
Hey! Damn it. Pippi! Stop!

01:04:53.524 --> 01:04:56.960
Don't proceed any further! Stay put.
Do you hear me? Stay put!

01:05:45.874 --> 01:05:48.241
There's one roaming right
above our position.

01:05:48.743 --> 01:05:49.904
I can see it.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.042
What do we do now?

01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:00.481
All right.

01:06:00.722 --> 01:06:05.659
I'm going to try and bring it back
into the main hall away from you.

01:06:06.427 --> 01:06:10.626
You go back up the ramp and then you turn
the corner and you keep going down.

01:06:10.831 --> 01:06:13.198
Eventually you'll get to
the underground garage.

01:06:13.267 --> 01:06:14.997
There will be weapons there.

01:06:16.937 --> 01:06:17.836
Weapons?

01:06:17.905 --> 01:06:23.537
Yes, we had some visitors earlier
in the evening and they came armed.

01:06:23.744 --> 01:06:25.576
What about our wounded?

01:06:25.813 --> 01:06:27.076
Just leave them there.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:29.517
They'll be safe. We have to move fast.

01:06:29.683 --> 01:06:30.912
Now you have the keys.

01:06:31.085 --> 01:06:34.886
All right? Now when you get out
go and get some help.

01:06:37.024 --> 01:06:38.855
No, you can't leave me here.

01:06:39.492 --> 01:06:41.552
Not with those things running around.

01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:44.961
This will be the safest place for you, Stephanie.
You heard the Warden.

01:06:45.498 --> 01:06:47.467
We need to move fast and you're injured.

01:06:48.501 --> 01:06:48.968
No.

01:06:49.035 --> 01:06:52.096
You need to stay still.
It'll help with the blood loss.

01:06:52.272 --> 01:06:55.936
I'll be okay. I want to go with you.

01:06:56.676 --> 01:06:58.110
I'll stay with you, Steph.

01:06:58.278 --> 01:06:59.940
Sarah, you're coming with us.

01:07:03.516 --> 01:07:09.387
I can't leave my wolf sister.
Beginning and the end.

01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:14.119
I'll stay with her.

01:07:15.561 --> 01:07:19.657
Look, before I crawled into the bottle
I was a real person.

01:07:19.731 --> 01:07:22.758
This is my last chance
to be a real person again.

01:07:23.235 --> 01:07:26.728
But I'm getting old and
can't move so fast.

01:07:27.306 --> 01:07:31.141
You young people have to get moving
so come on... get out of here!

01:07:43.989 --> 01:07:44.957
Thank you.

01:07:49.026 --> 01:07:50.858
What about the gimpy guard?

01:07:52.129 --> 01:07:56.191
This gimp is just fine. I can walk.

01:08:04.675 --> 01:08:08.305
Okay, Warden. We're ready.

01:08:19.023 --> 01:08:20.752
Here it comes.

01:08:32.636 --> 01:08:33.899
Hold it steady.

01:08:41.711 --> 01:08:42.770
Captain!

01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:47.317
Captain, you need to see this.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.026
What the hell is going on here?

01:09:06.301 --> 01:09:08.533
Okay. Come on, little buddy.

01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.296
Come on.

01:09:14.676 --> 01:09:18.238
Just stay right there. Right there.

01:09:21.183 --> 01:09:23.152
All right, go, go!

01:09:32.694 --> 01:09:35.162
- Come on!
- Shut it, shorty.

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:42.234
RUN!

01:09:57.418 --> 01:09:58.283
Come on!

01:09:59.253 --> 01:10:00.221
Hurry!

01:10:01.756 --> 01:10:03.383
I'm trying. I don't know which one.

01:10:05.992 --> 01:10:06.823
Go, go!

01:10:12.299 --> 01:10:15.326
OPEN IT! OPEN THE DOOR!

01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:27.941
Come on. You're not going
to let me die like this, are you?

01:10:28.014 --> 01:10:30.074
Eaten by a friggin dinosaur.

01:10:31.752 --> 01:10:33.345
I've known men like you.

01:10:35.088 --> 01:10:42.017
Small on the inside and no matter how many
people they hurt they always stay that small.

01:10:52.471 --> 01:10:53.769
I'll tell you what.

01:10:54.073 --> 01:10:57.908
You let me in there or I'm going
to beat that guard to death.

01:10:58.711 --> 01:11:01.146
You understand what I'm telling you?

01:11:01.247 --> 01:11:03.273
You want his blood on your hands?

01:11:04.517 --> 01:11:06.213
This what you want? Huh?

01:11:06.485 --> 01:11:07.748
No! Don't!

01:11:09.789 --> 01:11:10.654
Don't!

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:14.089
Get out of here! I'll be fine.

01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:17.161
No, he won't.
Open that door right now.

01:11:22.033 --> 01:11:23.501
Go, go!

01:11:23.768 --> 01:11:25.361
Get out of there, Armstrong!

01:11:44.956 --> 01:11:48.084
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

01:11:48.992 --> 01:11:50.620
Come on.

01:11:55.332 --> 01:11:56.322
Come on.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.765
Come on. Come on.

01:13:27.188 --> 01:13:28.280
Good luck, buddy.

01:13:28.689 --> 01:13:30.282
Wait!

01:13:31.692 --> 01:13:33.092
WAIT!

01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:50.109
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

01:13:57.818 --> 01:13:58.717
Which way?

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.180
The Warden says
there's weapons in the garage.

01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:06.691
Let me ask to make sure.

01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:09.621
Warden Lewis are you there?

01:14:16.703 --> 01:14:17.762
Warden Lewis?

01:14:19.739 --> 01:14:22.402
Something must have happened.
All the gunfire.

01:14:22.508 --> 01:14:23.976
The explosion.

01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:26.641
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:30.706
We keep on this trajectory we're going
to head straight into the city, sir.

01:14:30.817 --> 01:14:32.615
I know that. Keep going!

01:14:32.819 --> 01:14:33.843
There's so many of them, sir.

01:14:33.987 --> 01:14:34.977
Keep going!

01:14:37.489 --> 01:14:39.651
I see a path there.
I think they're clearing out.

01:14:40.826 --> 01:14:41.657
Oh my god!

01:14:55.207 --> 01:14:56.072
GO!

01:14:59.845 --> 01:15:01.006
Is it coming?

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.248
Shh. Let me listen.

01:15:20.765 --> 01:15:22.028
Is it there? We need to go.

01:15:54.798 --> 01:15:55.731
What is that?

01:15:56.266 --> 01:15:57.029
I don't know.

01:16:16.519 --> 01:16:20.614
Hey! What exactly do you think
you're doing, pal?

01:16:20.823 --> 01:16:22.382
Them girls, are mine.

01:16:26.195 --> 01:16:28.221
Hey, where you going, buddy?

01:16:29.498 --> 01:16:32.400
We ain't finished here.
Not by a long shot.

01:16:50.786 --> 01:16:53.653
Here kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty.

01:17:06.801 --> 01:17:09.498
Dang! You are one tough son of a bitch.

01:17:15.743 --> 01:17:18.542
Ha! 2 and 0.

01:17:20.848 --> 01:17:22.544
Get out of the truck.

01:17:23.284 --> 01:17:24.752
Monster's dead.

01:17:26.154 --> 01:17:28.520
- OUT!
- You sure?

01:17:28.722 --> 01:17:31.487
From my count there's still one left.

01:17:33.994 --> 01:17:35.485
Get out.

01:17:38.565 --> 01:17:39.658
Get out!

01:17:44.504 --> 01:17:45.369
I'm here.

01:17:46.072 --> 01:17:47.301
You are here.

01:17:48.341 --> 01:17:49.365
And?

01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:52.140
Get out.

01:17:52.279 --> 01:17:53.747
There's no one else.

01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:56.149
I'm the only one.

01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:58.812
Oh, you're good pipsqueak,

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.651
but I know you're lying.

01:18:01.754 --> 01:18:04.087
I'm not. I swear.

01:18:06.859 --> 01:18:11.695
Oh. Then you won't mind if I light up
the back of this truck with a grenade.

01:18:11.864 --> 01:18:13.355
No! Don't!

01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:20.967
It wasn't a real grenade, Sarah.

01:18:22.174 --> 01:18:23.642
He was lying.

01:18:24.677 --> 01:18:25.940
Maybe so.

01:18:26.078 --> 01:18:30.379
But if I had thrown it in there
it would have still been very unpleasant.

01:18:30.516 --> 01:18:32.849
Where you two little wolflings going?

01:18:33.052 --> 01:18:35.782
Come here. Give daddy wolf some love.

01:18:36.354 --> 01:18:37.413
Oh, gross.

01:18:37.956 --> 01:18:39.948
Why can't you just leave us alone?

01:18:40.258 --> 01:18:43.888
Oh, come on. All I want is a kiss.

01:18:45.063 --> 01:18:46.531
From each of you.

01:18:49.534 --> 01:18:51.127
I think that's the least you can do

01:18:51.302 --> 01:18:52.827
after I rescued you from that big,

01:18:53.004 --> 01:18:54.131
bad monster.

01:18:54.239 --> 01:18:57.300
A kiss? Yeah, right.

01:18:57.442 --> 01:18:59.673
I swear. Just one kiss.

01:19:00.411 --> 01:19:01.845
Honest.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.979
A regular honest Abe you are.

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:09.481
I also say please and thank you
when it's appropriate.

01:19:09.686 --> 01:19:12.850
Honey attracts flies
a lot more than vinegar.

01:19:13.857 --> 01:19:17.350
You might be small, but you're full of vinegar.

01:19:17.494 --> 01:19:20.396
Yeah? That's because I hate flies.

01:19:20.797 --> 01:19:24.290
When they cross my path
I enjoy picking off their wings.

01:19:24.368 --> 01:19:25.927
Buzz. Buzz.

01:19:30.741 --> 01:19:34.678
Oh, I like your spunk, girl. I really do.

01:19:35.045 --> 01:19:38.140
But my wings got pulled off a long time ago.

01:19:46.722 --> 01:19:48.213
Is there one behind me?

01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.892
Because if you take off when I turn

01:19:53.095 --> 01:19:57.191
it's not that hard to catch you and
when I do I'm going to be very

01:19:57.366 --> 01:19:59.062
unhappy with my little wolflings.

01:20:03.272 --> 01:20:04.604
Okay, then.

01:20:08.911 --> 01:20:11.039
We're wolves, little man.
And don't you forget it.

01:20:22.891 --> 01:20:23.881
What was that?

01:20:24.693 --> 01:20:26.457
I don't know, but we should probably
get the hell out of here.

01:20:26.628 --> 01:20:27.960
Come on!

01:20:31.099 --> 01:20:33.625
I just sent two of
your buddies straight to hell.

01:20:34.002 --> 01:20:36.198
I don't see why you can't join them.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.030
You're here.

01:22:25.644 --> 01:22:27.044
You alone?

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.772
The T-rex quarter is loose.
You know about that?

01:22:32.417 --> 01:22:34.214
My men are all dead.

01:22:35.119 --> 01:22:38.749
We encountered a massive pack
of Velociraptors heading towards the city.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.653
Yeah.

01:22:44.328 --> 01:22:45.591
I'm aware.

01:22:46.464 --> 01:22:48.729
What the hell is going on, LaFranco?

01:22:50.334 --> 01:22:59.243
Well, you might say this is the culmination
to all of my hopes and dreams.

01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:03.679
The beasties just didn't get loose.

01:23:04.482 --> 01:23:06.075
I set them free.

01:23:06.717 --> 01:23:12.952
I told you before,
'this was just a test run.'

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:20.296
In this day and age if you want to be heard
you have to make a really big statement.

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:30.596
All my pets are on the loose and I'm going
to ride into town and save the day.

01:23:31.174 --> 01:23:38.707
It's a first step on a White House run.

01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:44.313
Everyone is desperate for a hero

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:50.188
and I am going to be that hero.

01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:56.190
And you too. If you join me.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.332
So,

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:07.376
Talbot what's it going to be, huh?

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:10.908
Are you with me?

01:24:12.014 --> 01:24:13.915
Or against me?

01:24:17.451 --> 01:24:19.852
With or against.

01:24:23.724 --> 01:24:25.556
Heroes, huh?

01:24:25.826 --> 01:24:28.557
Oh yeah. Heroes.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:45.612
Against. Ooh-rah.

01:25:46.205 --> 01:25:47.696
Oh my god.

01:26:26.778 --> 01:26:30.271
Who would have thought that a jail
would be the safest place to be.

01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:34.575
What do you think is going to happen?

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.785
Do you think someone
is going to come for us?

01:26:41.658 --> 01:26:43.752
Eventually.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.401
Eventually can be a long time.
