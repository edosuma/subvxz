this,

lashing out about it.

supportive, and loving,

just being unreasonable.

to bust your balls, dude.

a fight with me

in the morning.

because you were too drunk.

You know, possibly the situation
going on with Katie.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.753
- What? What? What? What?
- Dude, dude.

08:39.787 --> 08:40.888
- All right, that's fine,
but, dude, why would you

08:40.921 --> 08:41.855
do that to me
right when I'm sitting

08:41.889 --> 08:43.023
on the edge of the water?

08:44.091 --> 08:45.959
- Because it's really fun
to f--- with Schwartz.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.160
- Jax, you want a beer?

08:47.194 --> 08:50.030
- Yeah, I'll take a beer.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.899
- Aah! Oh, my God!

08:51.932 --> 08:54.001
Who the f--- would put a snake
in the cooler, dude?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.937
- [laughing]

08:56.970 --> 08:58.038
- That's f---ed up.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.740
I could have easily
fallen in there.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.975
- I brought shots for everybody.
- Yeah!

09:02.009 --> 09:03.977
- Ooh!
- If you guess what shot it is,

09:04.011 --> 09:04.978
I'll give it to you.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.113
- It's a kamikaze.
- Yes.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.650
- Oh, my God, Dude.
- Ahh!

09:09.683 --> 09:12.786
Dude, holy sh--.
I actually thought it was shots.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.022
- Oh, he's so cute.
Your ass is not--

09:15.055 --> 09:16.724
- I would take a gator bite
for the team.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.725
- These gators--

09:17.758 --> 09:18.959
- Aah!
[all laughing]

09:18.992 --> 09:21.729
- What the--
- Yes!

09:21.762 --> 09:22.930
- I don't want to say I built
the whole trip

09:22.963 --> 09:24.665
around this moment,
but this was definitely

09:24.698 --> 09:26.667
something
that was going to happen,

09:26.700 --> 09:27.968
because it's the bachelor party,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.870
and that's what we do
with Schwartz.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.106
- That's it.
- Oh, my God.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.207
- Oh.
- Sorry.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.876
- Now there's
poop stains on there.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.211
- There better not be f---ing
poop stains on there.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.080
[upbeat pop music]

09:40.113 --> 09:44.918
- * Trying to save me
and to arrange me all along *

09:44.952 --> 09:46.119
*

09:47.220 --> 09:49.790
- Carter said that I get
"hot mess," so that's mine.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.225
Brittany,
you are the wild one.

09:52.259 --> 09:52.993
- Wild one!

09:53.026 --> 09:55.195
- Sexy and single can
only go to-

09:55.228 --> 09:56.764
- Stassi!

09:56.797 --> 09:58.732
- I mean, at least it says sexy.

09:58.766 --> 09:59.900
Like, sh-- could be worse.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.704
- Oysters Rockefeller.
- Thank you.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.873
- Why did you guys
get two orders?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.240
- I did order too much.
I'm sorry.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.978
- Oh, God. Oh.
- We have shrimp etouffee.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.245
- The smell makes me, like--
- I know.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.647
The smells are--I'm like--

10:13.681 --> 10:15.015
- My eyes start watering.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.784
- I'm not big on seafood.

10:16.817 --> 10:20.220
I especially don't like
anything in a shell.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.955
I don't want to be cracking,

10:21.989 --> 10:23.223
and ripping tails off,

10:23.256 --> 10:25.125
and pulling off skin
and, like, ugh.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.794
It just grosses me out.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.128
- I forget that you two
don't eat seafood.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.162
- That one's oysters,
you said?

10:29.196 --> 10:30.163
- I don't want it
in front of me.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.164
It might just make me--

10:32.299 --> 10:35.068
Seafood is the most--
it's very pungent.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.103
- Yeah.
- The scent.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.838
- The anorexics can go off.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.007
- It grosses me out,
so I can't imagine how you feel.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.975
- It's, like, so intense.
- Yeah.

10:42.009 --> 10:46.179
- I saw a new dating
website yesterday: Farmers Only.

10:46.213 --> 10:50.250
- I put thought into this,
but I think that you have to be,

10:50.283 --> 10:52.720
like, farmer-ish too.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.121
- So, when I was
in Katie's room this morning

10:54.154 --> 10:55.689
we were like getting ready
and didn't know

10:55.723 --> 10:56.757
they, like, got in a fight,

10:57.691 --> 10:57.958
and she showed me
a few texts from Tom.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.828
- She was mad because
we were walking so far.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.296
I also got her to admit
last night

11:03.330 --> 11:06.266
that because of the cheating,
that is what it is.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.901
- Thank you.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.705
- Last night, Carter, Katie,
and I had this huge talk,

11:11.739 --> 11:13.741
and we finally got to the bottom

11:13.774 --> 11:15.943
of why Katie fights with Tom,

11:15.976 --> 11:17.745
and it's because we all think

11:17.778 --> 11:20.047
that Schwartz f---ed a girl
in Vegas.

11:20.080 --> 11:24.084
I know that it's true because
I saw it in a text message.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.819
- That's not a text
that you should be reading.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.954
- What is it? What is it?

11:26.987 --> 11:29.322
- Schwartz!

11:29.356 --> 11:31.291
- Sh--.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.127
- You can move on, but you're
not gonna forget it happened,

11:34.161 --> 11:35.328
and it's still gonna
affect you forever.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.296
- Because it's so buried
deep down.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.832
- Yeah.
- And now, she's pissed off

11:38.866 --> 11:41.001
about every little thing
under the sun.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.202
- Yeah, but it's not
the little things.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.203
It's the bigger picture.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.704
- Everything.
- Yeah.

11:45.906 --> 11:46.874
By Schwartz cheating,
that broke the trust.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.208
And I know, for me, with Shay

11:49.009 --> 11:50.110
and the whole pill thing
last year,

11:50.143 --> 11:51.311
that broke my trust,

11:52.445 --> 11:53.213
and we couldn't fully move on
and recover from that

11:53.246 --> 11:56.116
until he owned it
and apologized.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.885
So that's what Schwartz
needs to do.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.153
- It's all about f---ing
Vegas girl. She said it.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.255
It's not me assuming that
or us assuming that's what...

12:02.289 --> 12:03.957
She said it last night.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.292
- Yeah.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.960
- They can't get married
and, like--

12:06.994 --> 12:08.028
he has to admit this
before the wedding.

12:08.061 --> 12:08.762
He has to.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.832
- Let's make it happen.
- Yeah.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.000
- Bridesmaids, ooh-ha-ha!

12:15.135 --> 12:17.838
- Make it rain. Whoo!

12:22.910 --> 12:26.346
- * I wish I didn't but I got
a thing for the bad boys *

12:26.780 --> 12:28.215
*

12:29.649 --> 12:31.184
- * I wish I didn't but I got
a thing for the bad boys *

12:31.218 --> 12:33.220
*

12:33.253 --> 12:35.555
- That was cool. That was cool.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.290
- All right, here's you all's
seating arrangement.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.292
My treat, man.
It's my treat.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.361
- Hey, wait, what's for lunch?

12:41.394 --> 12:42.495
- I got some boiled crabs,
you know.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.198
- Yes, holy sh--.
- Here we come.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.366
Coming down the table.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.270
- This is the coolest.
- F---ing coolest thing ever.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.205
- You don't get no better
than the blue crab down here

12:52.239 --> 12:53.473
in Southern Louisiana.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.808
- Hell, yeah.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.476
- How you feeling, man?
- Fine.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.878
- You okay?
- You don't look fine.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.948
- I feel bad for the crab
is all.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.183
- What?
- Well, we're eating it.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.317
It's not like
it's going to waste.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.253
- I know.
I just feel bad for them.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.554
- You check in with Katie
at all?

13:10.490 --> 13:11.959
- Like, you guys
should go to counseling.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.393
It'll help you.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.929
- No, f--- no, because she has
to take criticism.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.498
You try to criticize Katie,
she'll put that f---ing wall up

13:18.531 --> 13:20.300
so fast her head will spin.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.835
- But you also--
you got to understand, man,

13:21.869 --> 13:22.870
she wants you to have her back.

13:23.770 --> 13:23.803
She feels like you
never have her back.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.305
- I do.
- But that's what she feels.

13:26.173 --> 13:26.539
- That being, Carter,
that being said--

13:27.574 --> 13:27.607
- But that's what partners--
- After six years,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.409
you develop a callous.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.144
- There's something
that is literally,

13:31.845 --> 13:32.279
like, driving you guys apart.

13:33.113 --> 13:33.413
- Yeah.
- And it's not just you guys

13:33.981 --> 13:34.581
fighting all the time.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.416
Like, there's an outlier subject
that's, like,

13:37.417 --> 13:38.551
maybe when you hooked
with that girl in Vegas.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.556
I think that literally
weighs on her,

13:43.590 --> 13:45.625
and then she takes it out on you
because you've never, like,

13:45.658 --> 13:48.428
confronted her or had
a conversation about her.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.562
- Ugh. I really hate

13:49.596 --> 13:51.498
that Carter's bringing this up
right now.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.533
I mean, this was two years ago.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.869
- So did you--did you have sex
with some other lady?

13:55.903 --> 13:57.871
- No. F--- no.
- We heard all these rumors.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.007
Like, what am I
supposed to think?

14:00.040 --> 14:04.244
- Every time I think we've
resolved it and moved past this,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.213
it resurfaces
in the heat of the moment

14:06.246 --> 14:08.481
when she's really upset
or she's been drinking.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.483
- Tom, you've already
paid me back for that.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.019
You f---ed the girl in Vegas.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.420
You make out with a girl here.
You do all--

14:13.453 --> 14:16.023
like, you've already
paid me back tenfold.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.891
- It's like, come on, man.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.626
Give me a break.

14:19.659 --> 14:23.430
We had horrible problems long
before that and long after it.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.398
- And that's so f---ed up, man.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.534
-I feel partially responsible
for this rumor

14:27.567 --> 14:30.670
getting out in the first place
because we were in Las Vegas,

14:30.703 --> 14:33.340
and there was a bunch of people
that I was introducing to Tom,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.542
and one of them was
this Vegas girl.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.310
And God knows,
I didn't know that Katie

14:37.344 --> 14:38.545
and Tom were gonna end up
getting married.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.980
- But why is she mad?
- Right.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.915
- That is the problem.
She's mad--

14:41.949 --> 14:43.650
but she's mad
at you for a certain reason.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.318
- She's been mad
since before I met her.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.586
This sounds like
Kristen propaganda.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.321
This is Kristen propaganda,
dude.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.523
- This is Kristen propaganda,
dude, I'm sorry to say.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.592
- You were really mad
at her last night.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.526
- Carter doesn't give a sh--

14:53.560 --> 14:55.929
if Schwartz slept
with that girl or not.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.631
I mean, this has Kristen's
fingerprints all over it.

14:58.665 --> 15:02.936
Kristen is so desperate to try
and vindicate Katie

15:02.970 --> 15:04.471
instead of just admitting

15:04.504 --> 15:07.607
that Katie's behavior
has been horrible at times.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.675
- It takes two, dude.
- Exactly.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.377
- I'm telling you for sure
because Scheana,

15:10.944 --> 15:11.644
she's had her issues.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.613
She's, like, could be annoying
as f---, yeah.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.248
She's like--her voice--
like, everything,

15:15.815 --> 15:16.483
there was issues we had,

15:17.617 --> 15:18.651
but I had to be completely
honest with her and be like,

15:19.919 --> 15:20.453
"You make me feel sh-- when you
do this. Blah, blah, blah."

15:21.288 --> 15:21.321
And just, like,
tell her everything.

15:21.989 --> 15:22.922
She told me all the issues,

15:24.057 --> 15:25.292
and from there it's up to you
if you want to, like,

15:25.325 --> 15:26.559
work together or, like,

15:26.593 --> 15:27.594
you know, like,
compromise, dude.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.463
- That's great, but she doesn't
take your deepest,

15:30.497 --> 15:32.499
darkest insecurities
and throw them in your face

15:32.532 --> 15:34.467
and rage text you for six hours.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.536
- How are you getting married?
How are you getting married?

15:36.569 --> 15:39.106
- Huh?
- Listen, at the end of the day,

15:39.139 --> 15:41.408
you don't want to spend the rest
of your life living like this.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.344
Whether you love her or not,
sometimes it just--you know?

15:44.377 --> 15:45.312
- Yeah, I know, I know.

15:46.179 --> 15:46.479
- Take care of it
when you get home.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.649
- Nip it in the bud.
- Yeah, it's hard, dude.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.351
- And marriage,
it doesn't get easy,

15:51.384 --> 15:52.986
so it's not gonna get easier.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.555
- There's something inside
of her that's troubling her.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.991
- Maybe it is me, though.
- And there's something--it's--

15:58.025 --> 15:59.993
- You never know.
- You sound like a f---ing

16:00.027 --> 16:02.495
battered wife.
- Chill. No, Tom, chill.

16:02.529 --> 16:06.533
- I feel like I'm coming apart
over this.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.069
It hurts to see my friend
going through this.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.470
You guys are f---ing telling
Schwartz

comes from a nickname

25:39.071 --> 25:40.840

25:40.873 --> 25:42.008
many, many years ago.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.010
I kind of would love
to get into the story

25:44.043 --> 25:45.712

26:02.995 --> 26:04.831
I mean, in a bad way.

to get a guy

26:06.666 --> 26:07.634
to buy me a drink around here?

26:07.667 --> 26:08.635

Stassi planned,

with their mouths shut.

28:42.221 --> 28:42.254

girlfriends. That's my guess.

I'd be like, "I get it."

- I would do it too.

It seems like the main reason
a lot of people get murdered

28:54.466 --> 28:58.304

is because of cheating.

or an allergic reaction.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.786
Just something from today.
Shay doesn't drink.

29:13.820 --> 29:17.089
He feels kind of
out of place on this trip.

even change on our menu.

like what's coming.

add a little bit.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.741
- Ow.
- Do you want these?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.444
- No, I don't want yours.
- Can you undo my dress?

34:38.477 --> 34:40.446
- Come here. [laughs]

34:40.479 --> 34:42.848
- Please, I want
to take my clothes off.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.316
I'm a little wet, aren't I?

34:44.350 --> 34:47.186
- [laughing]

34:47.219 --> 34:50.722
You have on butt pants.
Oh, my gosh.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.424
[laughing]

34:52.458 --> 34:54.726
- Ugh.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.295
- Ahh!

34:56.328 --> 34:58.864
My balls can finally breathe.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.433
Holy sh--.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.469
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.404
I'll never do that to you again.

35:08.874 --> 35:12.811
- You want it just me and you?
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.314
I just- I'm gonna be
so straight up with you, okay?

35:15.347 --> 35:17.183
- Yeah.
- I had a really long talk

35:17.216 --> 35:19.351
with Katie last night.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.753
I'm sort of now
piecing together the fact

35:21.787 --> 35:24.223
that everything you
and Katie fight about,

35:24.256 --> 35:25.824
you fight about one thing.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.359
- Don't try to oversimplify it.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.460
- You fight about the fact
that you f---ed

35:28.494 --> 35:30.896
that chick in Vegas,

35:30.929 --> 35:33.365
and you never got over it.

35:33.399 --> 35:36.435
- Kristen, what the fu...
What the f---? You know?

35:36.468 --> 35:39.838
It just goes to show
how flawed their logic is,

35:39.871 --> 35:41.507
because we had
so many more fights

35:41.540 --> 35:43.375
before the Vegas thing
ever happened,

35:43.409 --> 35:45.244
so how do you explain that?

35:45.277 --> 35:46.745
We never had sex.
Yes, I mean it.

35:46.778 --> 35:47.779
- Yes, you did.
Carmen was there,

35:47.813 --> 35:48.914
and she saw it, and she's-

35:49.981 --> 35:50.682
- I'm out of here.
- No, please, Schwartz, please.

35:51.617 --> 35:52.418
- This is the dumbest
conversation ever.

35:53.118 --> 35:53.885
- Schwartz, please listen to me.

35:54.786 --> 35:55.421
- Go take four deep breaths,
and, like--

35:56.222 --> 35:58.190
- Please.
- You're f---ing basic.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.560
- Hey, princess,
where are you going?

36:01.593 --> 36:04.896
- Doute's the same basic bitch
that I always knew she was.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.498
- What?
- Ooh.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.534
- God damn it.
- Doute sucks.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.202
Same basic, psycho bitch,

36:10.236 --> 36:11.937
- Schwartz.
- F--- you, too.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.272
She poisoned your mind.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.773
- No, man,
you don't f---ing listen.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.276
- Guys, back off.
- I want you to f---ing

36:17.309 --> 36:20.279
be on the best page ever
before you get married, please.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.880
If Schwartz will just
tell the truth,

36:21.913 --> 36:23.249
it'll finally be out
in the open.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.183
He and Katie can move on
and get married.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.353
- Guys, guys,
what the f--- is--

36:27.386 --> 36:28.487
- Seriously, listen to me.

36:29.555 --> 36:30.188
- Let's just walk away.
- Tom, get the f--- away.

36:31.357 --> 36:31.390
- Yeah, don't pull me aside
and say, "Yeah, Carmen said--"

36:32.123 --> 36:32.858
I did not do it.
I know who I--.

36:34.125 --> 36:34.760
- Let's revisit this, all right?
- If you want, we can talk about

36:35.427 --> 36:36.895
who you've had sex with, too.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.564
- I know every, I--
[stammering]

36:38.597 --> 36:40.866
I talk about all the sh--
that I've done.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.235
- Just let him go.
- Can you go the f---

36:43.269 --> 36:44.270
away so we can talk to Tom?

36:44.303 --> 36:45.471
Thank you.
- No.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.838
- Chill, chill, chill.
- No, no, no.

36:46.872 --> 36:47.939
- You want to go to war?

36:47.973 --> 36:49.241
- Let's talk about it tomorrow.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.376
- You don't want
to go to war with me.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.910
- Can we let this go tonight?
- I will roast your ass.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.312
You don't want to go
to war with me.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.380
- Please, now you're
being Tequila Tom with me.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.481
- No, I am not.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.482
- No, he's not.
- I'm not Tequila Tom.

36:56.515 --> 36:57.483
I am a chill f---ing
human being.

36:57.516 --> 36:58.817
- No, he's not.
- Okay, Doute.

36:59.885 --> 36:59.918
- Can we talk about it tomorrow?
- Now we're done.

37:00.852 --> 37:00.886
- You're gonna give me
the scrunch face?

37:01.953 --> 37:03.522
- Let's really go.
- Dude, Doute, you need f---ing

37:04.623 --> 37:05.524
ten years of therapy, dude.
- Let's go. Let's go!

37:06.458 --> 37:07.025
- Sandoval, this is none
of your business.

37:07.058 --> 37:07.826
It doesn't concern you.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.895
- Really?
It doesn't concern you.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.897
- Yeah.
- Are you f---ing kidding me?

37:11.930 --> 37:14.333
Kristen is being Kristen.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.468
- Stop talking, Sandoval.
Get the f--- out of here.

37:16.502 --> 37:17.803
- Both of you guys get out
of here, get out of here.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.272
- Are you serious?
- She's a complete psycho.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.874
I've been there. I know.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.242
- Carter, I love you,
get out of here.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.945
Fine, Carter come in,
but not Doute, not Doute.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.482
- This is too much.
This is too much.

37:30.516 --> 37:33.485
- F---ing bitch whore.
Yes, I said that.

37:33.519 --> 37:34.786
- Whoa, watch
your f---ing mouth.

37:35.821 --> 37:35.854
Don't ever say that.
- I know, but dude- but--

37:36.688 --> 37:36.722
- Yes.
- But that's not the f---ing

37:37.556 --> 37:38.457
point.
- That is the f---ing point.

37:39.325 --> 37:39.825
- Do you have any idea
of the f---ing

37:40.826 --> 37:42.628
sh-- that Kristen's capable of?
I'll tell you.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.530
- But listen.
- It'll blow your mind, Carter.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.932
This is insane.

37:46.965 --> 37:50.369
I mean, Kristen was way worse
of a troll than Schwartz.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.003
- Listen, bro.
- There's no listening.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.406
You don't know her.
I was there, I was there.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.642
- If she's gonna get in my face
I'm gonna talk about old Doute.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.377
- You're dating a new
and improved Kristen.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.811
Kristen's, like, chill now,

38:00.979 --> 38:01.012
- No, but, it's not about
Kristen, it's not about Kristen.

38:01.880 --> 38:01.913
- Why are you yelling at Tom?
- F---.

38:02.914 --> 38:02.948
- And why is everyone
yelling at each other?

38:05.083 --> 38:06.985
- I tried to talk to Schwartz
about the Vegas girl sh--.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.987
Did you tell Ariana sort of?

38:09.020 --> 38:11.390
- Did we brief?
- Okay, Tom and Tom are,

38:11.423 --> 38:13.058
like, getting in Carter's face.
- How many guys did she f---

38:13.091 --> 38:14.460
while she was dating you?
- A lot.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.594
- Yeah, she sucked,
she sucked, she sucked.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.395
- This f---ing slut.

38:16.428 --> 38:19.431
- It's not
about Kristen right now.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.899
- I'm just telling you
what I used to deal with.

38:20.932 --> 38:21.967
That's what I'm saying.

38:22.968 --> 38:23.469
She brought up the past.
She brought up the past.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.437
That's a horrible person.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.639
- Everybody f---ing grows up,
Tom, and guess what?

38:27.673 --> 38:30.376
You grew up to be f---ing Sia.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.344
- Okay.
- You guys, honestly,

38:32.378 --> 38:33.579
you guys should date--
this is ridiculous.

38:33.612 --> 38:34.680
- Is it?
- All right, all right,

38:34.713 --> 38:36.882
- Carter.
- He's going for the digs.

38:36.915 --> 38:37.983
- Carter?
- He's going for the digs.

38:38.016 --> 38:38.984
You grew up and you became Sia.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.452
- Schwartz, come on.

38:41.687 --> 38:41.720
- Carter, you're think with
your dick, not your head, man.

38:42.554 --> 38:42.588
- No, you grew up
and you became Sia.

38:43.622 --> 38:43.655
- But you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

38:44.289 --> 38:44.322
- I'm not going out there.

38:46.157 --> 38:46.458
I'm not gettinginvolved in that.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.327
That's them, dude. This is--
that's a mess right there.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.863
- Either you did or didn't have
sex with that girl in Vegas.

38:52.931 --> 38:53.465
- That's neither here nor there
whether you did it

38:54.433 --> 38:55.066
or not, but she can--
- It doesn't matter.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.469
- But it does.
- You're f---ing goddamn right

38:57.503 --> 38:58.504
I made out with her.

38:59.471 --> 38:59.905
Yes, I made out with that chick.
I God damn-

39:00.706 --> 39:01.673
- And you didn't f--- her,
right?

39:01.707 --> 39:02.974
- I did not.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.643
- Carter, you really
don't understand.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.711
- You're asking for trouble

39:05.744 --> 39:07.012
if you're gonna get involved
in that.

39:08.046 --> 39:08.947
That right there--
- Do you think Tom is gonna--

39:10.115 --> 39:11.016
- Tom and Kristen--this has
been a war for ten years.

39:11.917 --> 39:12.684
That right there is
a ten-year battle.

39:13.519 --> 39:13.552
You're gonna get involved
in something

39:14.252 --> 39:15.421
you've been here for a year for?

39:16.254 --> 39:16.888
- I'm sorry.
- It's a war out there.

39:17.823 --> 39:17.856
- They're f---ing
talking about Kristen.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.425
She's not even out there.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.127
They're attacking Carter
and he's by himself.

39:25.497 --> 39:26.665
- What are you talking about,
out of line?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.467
She's been downstairs
the whole time.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.502
- Okay, all right,
you weren't there, bubba.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.538
- I wasn't there.
She's been downstairs.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.510
- Okay.

39:38.544 --> 39:41.079
- This is gonna be
a disaster tomorrow.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.213
[sighs]

39:44.215 --> 39:47.152
- Katie, on her own, decided,
"This is why I'm so f---ing

39:47.185 --> 39:48.620
angry, and he never admitted it.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.722
He never acknowledged it.
He f---ed this girl.

39:50.756 --> 39:53.124
I've already forgiven him,
but I need him to say it."

39:53.158 --> 39:56.962
- Okay, okay, so finally
though there's a root though.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.530
- Yes, yes.
- Thank God.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.098
If Katie really thinks
that Schwartz

40:00.131 --> 40:01.500
slept with this girl in Vegas,

40:02.634 --> 40:03.569
and she's been holding
onto this grudge for two years,

40:04.636 --> 40:06.605
I can totally see why
that would be a huge issue

40:06.638 --> 40:08.106
for her that she can't get over.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.208
They have a lot of sh--
that they need to deal with.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.677
- Schwartz was like,
"Doute, f--- you.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.645
You're a f---ing psycho bitch."

40:13.679 --> 40:15.514
This is a f---ing sh--show.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.651
- Dude, I'm done with it.
I'm done with Katie.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.987
I'm not marrying her.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.429
- He kissed a girl.
- That's not true.

40:32.163 --> 40:32.631
- Right.
- Oh, it's not true?

40:33.499 --> 40:33.532
Were you there?
- Sandoval, we've all--

40:34.132 --> 40:34.800
everyone already knows.

40:35.701 --> 40:36.635
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Were you there?

40:37.536 --> 40:38.003
- On my life, I did not f---
that girl.

40:38.937 --> 40:38.970
- No, you did not f--- her.
- I didn't.

40:39.771 --> 40:40.672
- I know you didn't f---
that girl.

40:41.540 --> 40:41.973
- But I did f---
the girl I'm marrying.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.675
I don't know
exactly what happened,

40:44.643 --> 40:46.612
but I'm almost positive
we didn't have sex.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.880
- Your penis was not capable
of going inside that girl.

40:48.914 --> 40:49.948
- Shhh. Chill, man.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.918
- Sorry, but it wasn't.
- I woke up in her room,

40:52.951 --> 40:53.952
and I left really early,

40:54.953 --> 40:57.022
and I knew that I had
f---ed up really bad.

40:57.055 --> 40:59.791
- Um, if someone wants
to tell me what the f---

40:59.825 --> 41:00.959
is happening,
that would be cool.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.661
- Like,
I pulled Schwartz outside,

41:02.694 --> 41:04.062
and I'm just like,
"No, I'm, like, I just want to,

41:04.095 --> 41:05.531
like, talk to you
about Katie, whatever."

41:05.564 --> 41:06.798
He starts getting defensive.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.500
He was like, "F--- you, Doute."

41:08.534 --> 41:09.801
- I'm sorry,
I don't know anything.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.871
- Oh, with the Vegas girl
and the cheating.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.674
- I didn't--you've never talked
to me about this.

41:15.707 --> 41:16.742
- About what?

41:17.743 --> 41:19.711
- Like, whether Schwartz
had sex with somebody.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.046
- Well.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.782
- I had no idea that's
why you all are fighting.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.685
That makes so much
f---ing sense.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.853
I wish I knew it.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.021
- This is something that
came about, like, when we were,

41:30.055 --> 41:32.691
like, not friends.

41:32.724 --> 41:36.027
Kristen bringing up
this Vegas girl to Tom

41:36.061 --> 41:38.096
was in good intention,

41:38.129 --> 41:40.966
even though the tact
and the execution of it was

41:40.999 --> 41:42.033
just completely off,

41:42.067 --> 41:45.837
but you can't put the toothpaste
back in the tube.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.105
I didn't want to talk
to everyone about it.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.575
I didn't want to make it
public knowledge.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.109
It was trying to protect--

41:51.142 --> 41:53.579
I was trying to protect Tom.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.080
- That's the f---ing issue.
That is the root

41:55.113 --> 41:56.748
of all these problems
is that Schwartz--

41:57.983 --> 41:59.618
- We did figure out that root
is Vegas of all previous issues.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.719
- Oh, that's the root.

42:00.752 --> 42:03.021
What about the four years
before that?

42:03.054 --> 42:05.691
- I'm done.

42:05.724 --> 42:07.726
Yeah, I'm done with her.
I'm done with Katie.

42:07.759 --> 42:10.696
I'm not marrying her.

42:10.729 --> 42:12.564
I'm not.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.666
I can not marry that.

42:16.735 --> 42:19.137
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:19.170 --> 42:22.007
- Tom and I have had
a few little flare-ups.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.875
- Flare-ups?
That doesn't sound good.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.143
- Bullsh--.
F--- you for saying that.

42:25.176 --> 42:26.945
- Leave him the f--- alone.

42:26.978 --> 42:29.715
He's a f---ing
battered wife.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.617
Look at him.

42:31.650 --> 42:35.787
- He basically admitted
to hooking up with that girl.

42:35.821 --> 42:37.756
- Like, sex?
- Yeah.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.024
- You put a ring
on my f---ing finger,

42:39.057 --> 42:41.927
so stop throwing it
in my f---ing face.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.029
- I don't deny the fact
that I cheated on you.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.063
- Two in one weekend.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.032
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

42:47.065 --> 42:48.867
- Tom, where's my penis?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.035
- Oh! Mwah.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.037
- Oh, my God.
- Whoo!

42:52.070 --> 42:53.772
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah!

42:53.805 --> 42:55.040
