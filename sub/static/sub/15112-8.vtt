WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:03.128
It's a lose-lose situation.

00:03.575 --> 00:05.160
Look, I keep telling my wife
she married me,

00:05.410 --> 00:07.110
not her mother,
and she keeps telling me

00:07.360 --> 00:08.438
not to put her in that position.

00:08.688 --> 00:09.635
Dealing with a mother-in-law...

00:10.426 --> 00:12.262
That's, like, #2 on my top ten list

00:12.512 --> 00:13.932
of reasons not to get married.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.057
What's #1?

00:15.881 --> 00:17.541
You know what #1 is.

00:17.791 --> 00:20.125
Every guy knows #1.

00:20.792 --> 00:22.879
All units in the vicinity,
campus security

00:23.231 --> 00:24.817
is reporting a possible illegal entry

00:25.067 --> 00:26.110
at the college pool.

00:26.841 --> 00:28.113
Dispatch, this is unit 7.

00:28.363 --> 00:29.321
We're on it.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.161 --> 00:52.861
Let me see your hands!

00:53.927 --> 00:54.722
Unit seven.

00:55.048 --> 00:56.473
We have the suspect.
He's on the high dive.

00:56.847 --> 00:59.059
Sir, please come down from there now!

01:01.786 --> 01:03.272
Sir, come down.

01:03.654 --> 01:04.982
Don't make us come get you.

01:08.159 --> 01:10.237
Police officers!
Show us your hands!

01:12.830 --> 01:14.616
Guys, it's okay.

01:14.965 --> 01:16.785
I-I'm a cop.

01:17.201 --> 01:18.537
My I.D.'s right here.

01:18.936 --> 01:20.873
I-I-I got to reach for it.
Hold on.

01:21.255 --> 01:21.999
Go ahead.

01:22.373 --> 01:23.959
Slowly.

01:32.449 --> 01:34.400
I got him.

01:38.906 --> 01:41.143
What the hell is going on,
detective Britten?

01:42.526 --> 01:44.727
It's kind of hard to explain.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.740
So tell me how this works.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.985
I'm awake with my wife,
and I close my eyes,

01:51.069 --> 01:52.571
I open them, I'm awake with my son.

01:53.003 --> 01:55.074
And this has been happening
since the accident?

01:57.367 --> 01:59.095
So you begin working on one case

01:59.494 --> 02:01.420
here in reality, and then suddenly

02:01.788 --> 02:03.874
you begin working another case
there in your dream.

02:04.281 --> 02:06.383
It all feels completely real to me.

02:06.633 --> 02:08.817
You can't tell
whether you're awake or asleep

02:09.067 --> 02:09.884
at this very moment?

02:13.524 --> 02:15.803
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.237
Tell him to trust me.
I'm handling this.

02:26.487 --> 02:28.939
Tell him I have the Butler files
and I'm on my way.

02:29.504 --> 02:31.817
Yeah. Yeah.

02:32.341 --> 02:33.968
Look, I'm trying
to get on the road now.

02:34.218 --> 02:36.503
Let me call you back
as soon as I get there.

02:37.794 --> 02:39.660
Listen, this is really nothing
to worry about.

02:39.962 --> 02:41.831
Okay. Yeah.

02:42.081 --> 02:43.933
Yeah, tell him I said that.

02:44.183 --> 02:45.749
Okay.

02:51.858 --> 02:53.424
Oh, come on.
You have to be kidding.

03:15.782 --> 03:17.364
Oh...

03:32.515 --> 03:36.091
Marcus, you are one lucky man
to be sitting here.

03:37.737 --> 03:39.022
Let me tell you something, my friend.

03:39.272 --> 03:40.304
You walk out that door,

03:40.606 --> 03:41.724
I have a feeling your luck

03:41.974 --> 03:43.159
would change very quickly.

03:43.409 --> 03:45.267
Testify, and we'll see
that you're taken care of.

03:45.578 --> 03:47.603
Yeah, taken care of...
taken care of how?

03:47.914 --> 03:48.666
You know the drill.

03:48.916 --> 03:50.314
Witness Protection, relocation.

03:50.649 --> 03:52.202
A chance to walk away from this mess

03:52.452 --> 03:53.469
and start afresh.

03:53.719 --> 03:55.819
Look, I told you before,
I'm just an accountant.

03:56.155 --> 03:58.447
You're an accountant
for Maxim Basayev.

03:58.791 --> 03:59.676
Now, we both know

03:59.926 --> 04:01.158
the only reason he's not gone down

04:01.494 --> 04:04.380
for human trafficking,
drugs, guns... you name it...

04:04.630 --> 04:06.013
is because he kills anyone

04:06.263 --> 04:08.582
he thinks might compromise
his operation.

04:08.935 --> 04:11.710
Don't insult us both
by pretending it's a surprise.

04:12.038 --> 04:13.389
We've been telling you
for two months now

04:13.639 --> 04:15.130
that we would take down
Basayev and his crew

04:15.475 --> 04:16.826
and that you could either help us

04:17.076 --> 04:18.216
or go down with them.

04:18.543 --> 04:20.552
Today, they threw you overboard.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.346
And as far as

04:22.682 --> 04:25.182
life preservers go, we're it.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.080
Where would I go?

04:37.330 --> 04:38.320
Well, the U.S. attorney

04:38.664 --> 04:40.948
will work with you
to find a suitable place.

04:42.568 --> 04:44.587
You and your wife.

04:44.837 --> 04:46.078
My wife.

04:46.405 --> 04:47.663
Yeah.

04:48.007 --> 04:50.627
Look, look, she
doesn't know anything.

04:50.877 --> 04:52.629
About what I did for Basayev.

04:52.879 --> 04:55.254
I understand, but I'm afraid
that's not going to help.

04:55.581 --> 04:56.789
He would use her to get to you.

04:57.039 --> 04:58.298
She's still a target.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.899
We have to get her
into protective custody

05:00.149 --> 05:00.467
as soon as possible.

05:00.857 --> 05:01.885
Where is she?

05:02.221 --> 05:03.137
She-she's out of town.

05:03.489 --> 05:04.530
Where?
Laguna.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.209
Some spa.
I... I don't know.

05:06.459 --> 05:08.077
I'll have to look it up in my phone.

05:08.327 --> 05:09.143
Okay.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.845
I'll get your phone,
and I'll get a car

05:11.095 --> 05:12.271
pointed in that direction.

05:18.237 --> 05:19.589
It's going to be okay.

05:19.839 --> 05:21.789
You're doing the right thing.

05:29.382 --> 05:30.581
When I came here...

05:30.917 --> 05:33.041
When I first took this job,

05:33.352 --> 05:35.502
it was supposed to be for us.

05:35.855 --> 05:37.956
We had nothing.

05:39.942 --> 05:42.228
I wanted to be...

05:42.478 --> 05:45.864
A man who could give her anything.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.059
Well, I'm sure she would rather
have a live husband

05:50.570 --> 05:53.562
than another giant flat-screen TV.

05:53.906 --> 05:55.406
Yeah.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.733
You don't know my wife.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.354
Marcus was strictly the accountant,

06:00.604 --> 06:01.987
but he knows where
the bodies are buried.

06:02.315 --> 06:04.656
I mean, he laundered cash
for him, covered money trails,

06:05.386 --> 06:07.284
and he kept records.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.994
Has he actually shown you
these records?

06:09.244 --> 06:10.958
No, but he's going to hand them
over as soon as we settle

06:11.208 --> 06:12.542
on a relocation package.

06:12.792 --> 06:13.540
We have been trying

06:13.893 --> 06:16.377
to nail Basayev
for the last eight years.

06:17.429 --> 06:18.587
This is a big win for us.

06:20.443 --> 06:21.965
The wife's arrived.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.057
She's on the way up.

06:32.278 --> 06:34.080
What's going on?
Are you okay?

06:34.330 --> 06:35.430
Hi.

06:35.981 --> 06:37.367
I'm fine. Yes, yes.
I don't understand.

06:37.617 --> 06:38.524
They wouldn't tell me anything.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.903
They just said you were
in some kind of danger.

06:41.153 --> 06:42.653
What's going on?

06:43.839 --> 06:45.697
Alina, I, uh...

06:47.927 --> 06:48.928
I, uh...

06:49.178 --> 06:51.147
Mrs. Ananyev, I'm detective Britten.

06:51.397 --> 06:54.317
Why don't we all go and sit down
somewhere more quiet? Hmm?

06:54.567 --> 06:56.083
Follow me.

06:59.872 --> 07:02.589
So you've been working for the...

07:03.309 --> 07:04.527
Bratva?

07:04.777 --> 07:05.801
Yes.

07:07.146 --> 07:08.303
For how long?

07:09.882 --> 07:11.473
Two...

07:11.817 --> 07:14.317
Two years.

07:16.956 --> 07:19.575
So you lied to me...

07:19.825 --> 07:21.525
For two years.

07:24.296 --> 07:25.863
Every day.

07:26.198 --> 07:28.240
Every time you kissed me good-bye.

07:28.567 --> 07:31.076
Every time you came home late.

07:31.404 --> 07:33.704
Every time I ask you,
"how was your day?"

07:34.040 --> 07:36.039
It was all just lies.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.041
No. Alina, listen.

07:39.878 --> 07:41.754
How could you not tell me?

07:42.081 --> 07:42.976
What if I had?

07:43.226 --> 07:44.510
Would it have made any difference?

07:44.760 --> 07:46.540
It was blood money.
Would knowing that

07:46.790 --> 07:48.052
have stopped you from spending it?

07:48.302 --> 07:49.094
Would you have given up

07:49.344 --> 07:50.435
all the clothes and the cars

07:50.685 --> 07:52.537
and the vacations, the gifts?
You wanted those things

07:52.787 --> 07:53.682
as much as me.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.684
Alina, I wanted them because you...

07:55.934 --> 07:59.354
And now we have nothing
because of your lies!

08:00.899 --> 08:02.274
You don't understand.

08:07.132 --> 08:08.632
So...

08:09.676 --> 08:13.869
We... we pack our home
and we leave everything?

08:14.213 --> 08:16.432
You can take whatever you can fit

08:17.164 --> 08:20.251
into, uh...
One large suitcase each.

08:25.858 --> 08:29.635
Where will they send us
with one large suitcase each?

08:29.962 --> 08:32.414
Well, the prosecutors
will work with you and Marcus,

08:32.971 --> 08:35.308
and, uh, they'll find somewhere
that you both feel...

08:36.058 --> 08:37.293
What about my friends?

08:42.875 --> 08:44.685
I can never speak to them again?

08:44.935 --> 08:47.486
Any link to your current life
or your identity

08:47.736 --> 08:49.905
makes it easier
for them to trace you.

08:51.784 --> 08:53.117
I'm sorry.

08:53.452 --> 08:54.701
I can't.

08:55.054 --> 08:55.922
This is...

08:56.172 --> 08:56.995
Alina.

08:57.306 --> 09:00.006
Alina, please, come
back here and sit down.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.462
They will find you, Mrs. Ananyev.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.204
They tried
to kill your husband today.

09:10.454 --> 09:11.651
Put a bomb in his car.

09:11.901 --> 09:13.502
He's lucky to be alive.

09:14.273 --> 09:16.056
He's in a unique position

09:16.408 --> 09:18.225
to bring down
a major crime syndicate.

09:18.577 --> 09:20.436
These people will not hesitate

09:20.686 --> 09:22.604
to do whatever it takes to you

09:22.948 --> 09:24.690
to stop him cooperating.
You understand?

09:25.017 --> 09:27.609
They will find you.

09:29.688 --> 09:32.520
I know this must be overwhelming.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.839
I'm sorry,
but if you value your life...

09:37.400 --> 09:39.001
you really have no option.

09:48.714 --> 09:52.001
Please, come sit down.

10:04.104 --> 10:04.945
Alina.

10:05.195 --> 10:06.695
So...

10:08.567 --> 10:10.611
what happens now?

10:33.903 --> 10:35.271
How long will we live here?

10:35.521 --> 10:36.739
Uh, just until the details

10:36.989 --> 10:38.274
for your relocation package
are worked out.

10:38.524 --> 10:40.724
Shouldn't be more than a few days.

10:41.327 --> 10:42.893
Now, we got a team of officers

10:43.143 --> 10:44.013
in the adjoining room.

10:44.263 --> 10:45.548
We got some downstairs in the lobby.

10:45.798 --> 10:46.983
If you need anything at all,

10:47.233 --> 10:49.316
you speak to them,
or you can call us,

10:49.902 --> 10:52.403
but under no circumstances
can you leave the room.

10:52.738 --> 10:54.238
Is that clear?
Yeah.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.699
My mother... she...

10:59.545 --> 11:01.161
gave me a painting before she died.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.265
There's, um,

11:03.515 --> 11:04.832
also a book of photos.

11:05.150 --> 11:06.625
We'll se a team to your house
to collect some items.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.738
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

11:08.988 --> 11:10.106
Bella.

11:10.356 --> 11:12.047
Oh, my God. Bell...
We have Bella right now.

11:12.358 --> 11:13.465
Uh, who's Bella?

11:13.715 --> 11:15.384
Our cat. She probably
hasn't eaten all day.

11:15.694 --> 11:16.760
We have to get her right now.
Calm down!

11:17.062 --> 11:19.221
I won't go without Bella!
Alina, I want to help.

11:19.565 --> 11:20.732
I'll kill you!

11:24.726 --> 11:28.355
- Come here! Come here!
- You've destroyed us!

11:29.108 --> 11:31.961
All right. All right.
All right, let's calm down.

11:32.211 --> 11:33.861
Come on.

11:36.916 --> 11:39.324
Okay, I'm going to let you go.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.577
You stay calm?

11:45.457 --> 11:47.082
It's going to be okay.

11:53.432 --> 11:55.049
It's going to be okay.

11:55.768 --> 11:58.521
How can you say that?

11:58.771 --> 12:00.679
You tell me I can never go back home.

12:03.192 --> 12:04.593
Everyone I know.

12:04.843 --> 12:06.562
Everything we have.

12:06.812 --> 12:08.395
I have to leave it all behind.

12:11.955 --> 12:16.892
How can you possibly tell me
it's going to be okay?

12:17.790 --> 12:21.408
You can't even begin to imagine
what that feels like.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.578
Hey.

12:45.828 --> 12:46.483
Hey.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.726
When did you start doing all this?

12:48.180 --> 12:49.784
Uh, about three days ago.

12:50.034 --> 12:51.799
Well, I thought we were
going to do it together.

12:52.049 --> 12:53.534
Yeah, you said you wanted
to do it last weekend,

12:53.784 --> 12:55.592
and the weekend before that, so...

12:55.842 --> 12:57.236
I just decided to do it myself.

12:58.555 --> 13:00.239
You giving away this dress?
I love you in this dress.

13:00.626 --> 13:02.366
I haven't worn that dress
in, like, 15 years.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.493
And even when I did,
I looked like a hooker.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.082
China? What's the matter
with the china?

13:10.386 --> 13:12.584
We're giving that away?
We don't touch it. We haven't

13:12.988 --> 13:14.378
used it once in 18 years.

13:14.757 --> 13:16.380
Well, we're going to Oregon.
Maybe in Oregon we'll...

13:16.630 --> 13:18.340
Be china kind of people.

13:18.727 --> 13:20.342
No?
Ah.

13:20.729 --> 13:24.722
Look, deciding what to keep and
what to give away... it's hard.

13:25.117 --> 13:26.519
We could come up with a reason
to keep everything.

13:26.769 --> 13:27.683
So, I just figured,

13:28.070 --> 13:30.686
if we don't use it,
we should lose it.

13:37.630 --> 13:39.314
Oh, come on.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.448
You're giving this away?

13:42.885 --> 13:44.199
Michael.

13:44.587 --> 13:45.909
And we have a tape player?

13:47.284 --> 13:48.495
I mean, I don't even know

13:48.745 --> 13:51.215
if it works anymore.
Where is it?

13:52.482 --> 13:54.670
It's right there.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.086
I can't believe it.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.783
I made you this tape.

13:58.033 --> 13:59.106
Remember that summer?

13:59.356 --> 14:01.340
You were working in Chatsworth.

14:02.586 --> 14:04.676
Here we go.

14:04.926 --> 14:06.472
You hated that job...

14:10.064 --> 14:11.742
but you loved this song.

14:25.039 --> 14:26.075
You remember?

14:26.325 --> 14:28.014
Of course I remember.

14:28.264 --> 14:30.149
You recorded that song,
like, over and over again

14:30.399 --> 14:31.586
so I can listen to it
on the way to work

14:31.836 --> 14:33.470
without having to hit rewind.

14:48.684 --> 14:50.102
When's goodwill coming?

14:50.352 --> 14:51.318
Tomorrow morning.

14:51.568 --> 14:53.477
All right, let me call and put
'em off for a couple of days.

14:53.889 --> 14:54.812
Michael...

14:55.191 --> 14:56.772
What?

14:58.873 --> 15:00.850
Nothing. It...

15:01.100 --> 15:02.444
Look, this move to Oregon was my idea

15:02.902 --> 15:05.197
and I just know you have
some reservations about it.

15:05.601 --> 15:06.747
I just want to look
through everything

15:06.997 --> 15:08.667
and make sure you're
not giving away things

15:08.917 --> 15:10.119
that I'd like to keep.

15:10.369 --> 15:13.053
Don't read anything more
into it than that.

15:13.824 --> 15:15.625
Really?

15:16.330 --> 15:17.830
Yeah.

15:20.349 --> 15:22.143
You didn't tell him I was coming?

15:22.393 --> 15:23.949
He'll be fine.

15:24.199 --> 15:26.530
This guy Jake... He's been your C.I.
for how long?

15:26.780 --> 15:28.679
For 15 years.
15 years?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.635
How do you know he'll be okay
working with me?

15:30.885 --> 15:32.843
Because he's not a complicated guy.

15:33.093 --> 15:35.338
Trust me, I know.
Look...

15:35.769 --> 15:36.780
You give him those. Cubans.

15:37.030 --> 15:38.897
He'll be your new best friend.

15:40.672 --> 15:41.537
Hey.

15:41.787 --> 15:43.277
You read with those things on?

15:43.672 --> 15:46.192
No, but I can't read
with them off either.

15:46.442 --> 15:47.948
Doesn't matter.

15:50.845 --> 15:51.871
Who the hell is this?

15:52.121 --> 15:53.912
Uh, Jake, this is my partner.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.922
I'm detective Efrem Vega.
I've heard a lot about you.

16:00.546 --> 16:02.212
The deal is I deal with you.

16:02.591 --> 16:04.508
Period.
I know, but,

16:04.758 --> 16:06.445
I'm not gonna be around much longer.

16:06.695 --> 16:09.270
The arrangements always work
for us pretty well, right?

16:09.520 --> 16:11.910
So, I thought the two of you
might be able to keep it going.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.062
What does that mean... you're not
gonna be around much longer?

16:16.065 --> 16:17.186
Are you leaving me?

16:17.436 --> 16:19.688
I'm not leaving you.
I'm going with my wife.

16:20.075 --> 16:20.939
Going where?

16:22.544 --> 16:24.063
Oregon.

16:24.313 --> 16:25.611
Oregon?

16:26.015 --> 16:27.404
Who the hell lives in Oregon?

16:27.783 --> 16:29.156
That's what I keep asking him.

16:33.289 --> 16:35.537
The point is,
if you want to keep drawing

16:35.958 --> 16:38.499
these get-out-of-jail-free
cards, Vega's your guy, okay?

16:42.698 --> 16:43.879
Uh...

16:44.300 --> 16:47.591
I hear that you are a fan of these.

16:49.038 --> 16:50.260
Yeah, well, I-I quit.

16:51.774 --> 16:52.525
Quit?

16:52.775 --> 16:53.993
Come on.
These are your favorite cigars.

16:54.243 --> 16:55.599
I got eyes.
I can see what they are.

16:56.045 --> 16:58.143
The doctor told me
it's giving me reflux.

16:58.580 --> 16:59.680
Oh.

17:00.812 --> 17:01.916
Sorry.

17:03.419 --> 17:05.938
Hey, what do you say we go someplace

17:06.188 --> 17:07.111
that's got real food, huh?

17:07.521 --> 17:10.071
I feel like a New York steak

17:10.492 --> 17:12.825
served to me by a woman
that's half my age.

17:13.262 --> 17:15.577
Sorry the captain's
got us on a short leash,

17:15.998 --> 17:16.954
but here.

17:17.366 --> 17:19.330
You can pay for your steak and mine.

17:19.768 --> 17:21.402
Generous tip.
Be careful.

17:28.544 --> 17:29.174
So...

17:29.645 --> 17:30.926
You said something

17:31.347 --> 17:33.012
about a crew pulling a job?

17:33.849 --> 17:34.638
Yeah.

17:35.384 --> 17:36.890
San Pedro industrial park.

17:37.319 --> 17:38.637
When?

17:38.887 --> 17:40.506
Tonight.

17:40.756 --> 17:42.146
Tonight?
Mm-hmm.

17:42.558 --> 17:44.310
11:30.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.711
They're hitting a warehouse

17:45.961 --> 17:48.193
that's leased to, uh,
Palace Electronics.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.149
Palace.
Mm-hmm.

17:50.399 --> 17:51.280
And from what I understand,

17:51.700 --> 17:54.116
they got a six-man team
with body armor.

17:54.570 --> 17:57.119
So you better bring your whole posse.

18:00.376 --> 18:01.248
That it?

18:01.677 --> 18:03.250
What do you want? A map?

18:05.764 --> 18:06.378
Thanks.

18:06.849 --> 18:07.850
Yeah.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.716
Have a good time in Oregon.

18:11.153 --> 18:12.338
See ya around.

18:12.588 --> 18:13.385
See ya.

18:16.392 --> 18:17.890
Better get a team together.

18:18.310 --> 18:21.268
6 out of 19, uh, we're clear
all the way down the block

18:21.697 --> 18:22.897
on our side. Over.

18:37.592 --> 18:39.899
36, you got an overhead
that's out right there.

18:40.149 --> 18:41.872
I don't got a visual on you.

18:46.088 --> 18:47.127
Maybe he got it wrong.

18:47.556 --> 18:49.254
The last time Jake got anything wrong

18:49.858 --> 18:51.340
you were repeating sixth grade.

18:53.295 --> 18:54.713
Have a little patience.

18:54.963 --> 18:56.178
I lost my patience an hour ago,

18:56.598 --> 18:58.117
which was two hours after Jake said

18:58.367 --> 18:59.807
this crew was supposed to show.

19:00.235 --> 19:01.560
Everyone, heads up.

19:01.810 --> 19:04.479
We got an unmarked truck headed
towards the target location.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.933
What I tell you?
Little patience.

19:08.183 --> 19:09.817
7W43 copy.

19:10.245 --> 19:12.361
All units, hold your positions.
Stand by for my orders.

19:22.487 --> 19:23.678
Okay, copy that.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.667
Confirm visual. Vehicle approaching.

19:39.565 --> 19:41.390
Just got visual.
Single driver.

19:41.844 --> 19:44.017
Please respond.

19:50.953 --> 19:52.651
That was exciting.

19:54.857 --> 19:56.408
Let's do a low-profile traffic stop

19:56.658 --> 19:57.865
in case he flagged us and kept going.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.161
Copy that.

20:04.032 --> 20:05.205
He's playing you.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.126
I've known him
for 15 years, all right?

20:09.376 --> 20:12.107
Exactly. After 15 years,
you hand him off with a c-note

20:12.357 --> 20:13.700
and a couple of Cubans.

20:13.950 --> 20:15.076
I know it doesn't agree with you,

20:15.326 --> 20:16.884
but a little warm and fuzzy
doesn't hurt.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.844
He's a C.I....
confidential informant.

20:19.442 --> 20:20.763
It's a business relationship.

20:21.183 --> 20:23.182
He knows better than anyone, bad tips

20:23.619 --> 20:24.725
are bad for business.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.914
Redrum. I guess you know
everything about everything.

20:27.164 --> 20:28.707
So, I'm just going
to sit back, hear it,

20:28.957 --> 20:31.857
and, you know, wait
for more trucks not to appear.

20:33.662 --> 20:37.328
7-11-43, trucks clear.
No involvement.

20:39.929 --> 20:40.741
Copy.

20:41.087 --> 20:42.194
Let's get a good F.I.
just in case

20:42.444 --> 20:43.201
and then kick 'em.

20:43.451 --> 20:44.752
Yes, sir. You got it.

21:00.209 --> 21:01.276
Yeah?

21:03.671 --> 21:05.516
Hello? Bird?

21:05.766 --> 21:07.184
How soon can you get over here?

21:07.596 --> 21:09.069
Why? What's going on?
What is that?

21:09.319 --> 21:11.388
What you're listening to
is Markus freaking out.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.982
He woke up this morning
and Alina had left.

21:14.436 --> 21:15.242
What time?

21:15.492 --> 21:17.611
Well, the last confirmed time
was, like, 2:00 A.M.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.113
Do we have any idea where she is?

21:19.363 --> 21:21.448
None. Nobody knows anything.

21:21.910 --> 21:23.781
Let's hope Basayev doesn't either.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.782
Just get over here, okay?

21:36.004 --> 21:38.090
Oh. I should have just
died in that explosion.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.919
If I would have gone,
Alina would be safe.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.678
She wouldn't be in danger.

21:42.928 --> 21:45.020
- The idea of her out there, alone...
- Marcus.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.516
- Unprotected...
- Marcus.

21:46.766 --> 21:47.975
You need to focus, okay?

21:48.998 --> 21:50.102
You need to write down

21:50.352 --> 21:51.284
anyone who you could think of

21:51.534 --> 21:52.688
that she might be with right now.

21:52.938 --> 21:53.981
Relatives maybe.

21:54.231 --> 21:55.921
No, neither of us have family here.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.317
Okay, what about friends?

21:57.567 --> 21:59.695
Friends...
Oh, come on, man!

21:59.945 --> 22:00.647
She must have friends!

22:00.897 --> 22:02.489
I was always working, okay?

22:02.739 --> 22:04.756
I don't really know her friends.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.492
I remember a few people
she talked about.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.622
Okay.
Mariana,

22:11.322 --> 22:14.507
Svetlana... I don't know.
Only their first names.

22:14.876 --> 22:16.707
All right, what about places
she used to go?

22:16.957 --> 22:19.210
When you were at work,
where did she like to go?

22:19.460 --> 22:21.530
- Where'd she hang out?
- I don't know.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.333
Spas, beauty salons, book clubs.
I don't know.

22:24.761 --> 22:25.166
I don't know.

22:25.416 --> 22:27.598
Do you even know your wife
at all, Marcus?

22:36.398 --> 22:39.268
I guess about as well as she knew me.

22:45.261 --> 22:47.396
That doesn't mean I don't love her.

22:49.244 --> 22:51.246
Everything I did was to give Alina

22:51.652 --> 22:53.499
the kind of life
I thought she wanted.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.460
Without her,

22:56.710 --> 23:00.144
nothing matters.
Nothing.

23:00.394 --> 23:02.091
So unless you find her,

23:03.436 --> 23:05.511
you can forget about me testifying.

23:05.761 --> 23:06.285
Marcus...

23:06.535 --> 23:07.805
Whatever I have to do

23:08.055 --> 23:11.337
to keep Alina safe,
I will do it, okay?

23:14.180 --> 23:17.783
Even if that means giving myself
up to Basayev.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.371
All right.

23:26.621 --> 23:27.741
Call records.

23:28.122 --> 23:29.340
She checked her messages
before she left,

23:29.590 --> 23:30.959
but it the phone's
been off since then.

23:31.209 --> 23:33.122
We can't track her
unless she turns it back on.

23:33.372 --> 23:35.129
Credit cards?

23:35.379 --> 23:36.834
The last transaction was the atm

23:37.084 --> 23:38.016
in the motel lobby.

23:38.266 --> 23:39.586
She was obviously smart enough

23:39.836 --> 23:40.752
to know we'd be looking.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.937
All right. We've got an
"attempt to locate" out,

23:43.187 --> 23:45.050
notify the bus terminals,
airports, but let's face it:

23:45.300 --> 23:47.886
It's probably tipped off Basayev
that she's in play.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.227
What?

24:11.866 --> 24:14.204
The last transaction
before she took the cash,

24:14.902 --> 24:16.915
it's at her hotel
in Palm Springs, the Palace.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.876
Oh, yeah. We called.
She's not there.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.643
Did we send somebody out?

24:20.893 --> 24:22.009
I just said she's not there.

24:22.259 --> 24:23.630
She's not at any of the other places

24:23.880 --> 24:25.281
on Marcus' list either.

24:25.935 --> 24:28.195
At least we know she was there for
three days before she bolted.

24:28.445 --> 24:29.595
Maybe she said something to someone

24:29.845 --> 24:31.741
that'll give us somewhere to dig.

24:31.991 --> 24:33.421
So you want to go talk

24:33.671 --> 24:36.185
to a hotel staff
instead of her friends?

24:38.821 --> 24:40.064
Yeah.

24:41.562 --> 24:42.895
You coming?

24:52.840 --> 24:53.758
Morning.

24:54.008 --> 24:55.159
How can I help you gentlemen?

24:55.409 --> 24:56.747
I'm detective Britten.
This is detective Freeman.

24:56.997 --> 24:58.207
We're looking for a missing person

24:58.457 --> 24:59.684
who was a guest here
over the weekend.

24:59.934 --> 25:00.542
Yes, the clerk told me.

25:00.843 --> 25:02.628
Mrs. Ananyev.
How can I help?

25:02.878 --> 25:03.723
We'd like any information

25:03.973 --> 25:04.914
that might help us track her down.

25:05.164 --> 25:07.334
So, uh, she spoke
to anyone in the hotel?

25:07.584 --> 25:08.882
She used any of the services?

25:09.132 --> 25:10.418
Maybe made a call from her phone?

25:10.668 --> 25:12.429
Let me pull up her folio.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.831
I'm afraid there were no calls,

25:17.225 --> 25:20.218
and no indication she used
any guest amenities

25:20.468 --> 25:21.647
except for room service.

25:22.156 --> 25:23.933
Thank you.

25:25.421 --> 25:27.752
That is a steep room service charge,

25:28.195 --> 25:30.594
if you don't mind me saying.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.048
That's one expensive breakfast

25:34.298 --> 25:35.828
for a woman someone
who can't weigh more than 110.

25:36.682 --> 25:39.164
Was Mrs. Ananyev
staying here with someone?

25:39.414 --> 25:40.488
I'm afraid I don't know.

25:40.738 --> 25:43.293
She registered
for a single king-size bed.

25:43.543 --> 25:44.524
Mm-hmm.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.589
Is your bartender on yet?

25:47.839 --> 25:49.480
Russian accent, a lot of jewelry?

25:49.730 --> 25:52.214
She ran up a hefty bill
for someone drinking alone.

25:52.464 --> 25:53.512
Yeah.

25:53.762 --> 25:55.639
Yeah, I remember.
She wasn't alone.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.391
All right.
Who was she with?

25:57.641 --> 25:58.767
I assumed it was her husband.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.525
You get a name?

26:00.775 --> 26:01.812
No.

26:02.062 --> 26:05.232
But he was here before her,
bought himself a drink.

26:05.482 --> 26:06.831
I can probably pull
the credit card slip.

26:07.081 --> 26:08.318
What did he look like, this guy?

26:08.568 --> 26:09.600
Blond, about your height.

26:09.850 --> 26:12.800
It looks like he spent
a lot of time at the gym.

26:15.556 --> 26:16.856
Hold on. I'm coming.

26:21.161 --> 26:22.013
Yes?

26:22.263 --> 26:23.041
Greg Hollander?

26:49.401 --> 26:50.352
Shh!

26:50.819 --> 26:52.054
He's not answering his cell.

26:52.304 --> 26:53.138
Maybe we're too late.

26:53.388 --> 26:55.290
Maybe they're already
on their way to Cabo.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.201
Let's put out an attempt to locate.

27:08.754 --> 27:10.464
See anything?

27:10.889 --> 27:11.989
No.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.972
I'll go get a warrant.
Go back inside, take a look.

27:19.222 --> 27:22.222
That's gonna take all day.
What else we gonna do?

27:36.281 --> 27:37.866
Set?
Yep.

27:50.929 --> 27:52.881
Major crimes confirmed
they're muscle for Basayev,

27:53.131 --> 27:53.965
fresh off the boat.

27:54.215 --> 27:55.634
It's probably why
we didn't recognize 'em.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.636
I'm gonna go talk to him,
see if I can't get anything.

27:57.886 --> 27:59.012
What about lover boy?

27:59.262 --> 28:01.106
They tell me he's got no connection

28:01.598 --> 28:02.725
with the accountant, with Basayev.

28:02.975 --> 28:04.810
Maybe he just hooked up
with the wrong woman.

28:05.060 --> 28:05.943
I'll catch up with you later.

28:06.193 --> 28:07.392
Okay.

28:07.642 --> 28:08.562
Look straight ahead.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.814
All right, give me a minute here.
You can finish later.

28:14.519 --> 28:16.446
All right, Greg,
what'd you tell them?

28:16.696 --> 28:17.573
Nothing.

28:17.823 --> 28:18.407
Come on, Greg.

28:18.657 --> 28:20.200
Your face looks like
a tray of lasagna.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.911
It's okay. You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

28:23.370 --> 28:24.246
You can't expect me to believe

28:24.496 --> 28:25.998
you didn't tell them where she was?

28:26.248 --> 28:27.750
I don't know where she is.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.720
And even if I did, I wouldn't put Alina
in harm's way.

28:32.170 --> 28:35.490
She's my friend.
I love her.

28:35.740 --> 28:37.718
Oh, and someone else
figured that out.

28:37.968 --> 28:40.262
Any idea who could have pointed
them in this direction?

28:40.512 --> 28:41.980
Could've been anyone.

28:42.230 --> 28:43.598
Maybe she told a friend about me.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.642
Maybe one of my clients
saw us together.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.602
What's your line of work?

28:48.061 --> 28:49.361
I...

28:50.689 --> 28:52.808
Provide companionship.

28:53.275 --> 28:56.311
Upon request.

28:56.778 --> 28:57.863
To men.

29:04.569 --> 29:06.705
So, your relationship

29:07.539 --> 29:08.990
with Ms. Ananyev...

29:09.499 --> 29:10.792
Wouldn't be...?

29:11.251 --> 29:12.836
I mean, you wouldn't have, uh...?

29:13.086 --> 29:16.331
Even if I was straight,
that's not what Alina was after.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.167
What was she after?

29:19.635 --> 29:21.720
Just someone to be with.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.839
Someone to talk to, have fun with.

29:24.306 --> 29:27.409
And did she give you money
for your time?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.211
I never asked for it.

29:29.461 --> 29:30.812
She forced it on me.

29:31.271 --> 29:33.849
Forced. Like she was allergic to it.

29:34.316 --> 29:36.818
But she kept insisting, so...

29:37.361 --> 29:39.955
I'm letting her pay
for my schutzhund certification.

29:40.405 --> 29:43.658
Your... sorry. Your what?

29:44.117 --> 29:47.413
I want to train dogs for a living.

29:51.041 --> 29:53.502
And, uh, how did you two meet?

29:53.961 --> 29:55.337
We go to the same gym.

29:55.587 --> 29:57.339
We just... I don't know...
we clicked.

29:58.056 --> 30:00.742
We'd go out for drinks
at silly clubs.

30:01.218 --> 30:03.429
We'd go dancing.
She's always dancing.

30:05.639 --> 30:07.558
You ever hear her laugh?

30:08.800 --> 30:09.651
No.

30:10.102 --> 30:12.187
I doubt anyone but me has
in a long time.

30:12.646 --> 30:14.756
You mean her husband?

30:15.232 --> 30:16.858
Especially her husband.

30:17.317 --> 30:18.277
So, she mentioned him?

30:18.527 --> 30:21.077
That's really all
she ever talked about.

30:21.546 --> 30:23.763
How happy they used to be
when they first got married,

30:24.013 --> 30:28.905
and how sad it made her
that they'd grown so far apart.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.181
Hey.

30:40.431 --> 30:42.009
Britten's on the phone for you.

30:42.350 --> 30:43.718
Did you find her?

30:43.968 --> 30:46.721
I told you you can forget my
help until I know Alina's safe.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.098
I told you that!

30:48.348 --> 30:49.457
Calm down.
We're on the same team.

30:49.707 --> 30:52.494
I just need some help here.
I need some background.

30:52.744 --> 30:54.480
Where did you guys meet?

30:56.364 --> 30:57.365
New York. Why?

30:57.816 --> 31:00.902
What about places you used to go
on the east coast?

31:01.361 --> 31:03.822
Before you got the job.
A place that felt special.

31:04.689 --> 31:06.875
I don't know. I don't know.
It was so long ago.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.161
We didn't really have money
to go anywhere at all.

31:09.411 --> 31:10.345
Why are you asking me this?

31:10.595 --> 31:15.684
That young couple that you were,

31:16.084 --> 31:19.129
if you ran away together,
where would you be?

31:25.543 --> 31:27.845
Yeah, there is one place, but, uh...

31:30.148 --> 31:32.935
I don't know
if it's even still there.

32:01.061 --> 32:02.562
Alina.

32:13.715 --> 32:15.644
You're going to take me back?

32:18.826 --> 32:21.928
Basayev's been looking for you
as hard as we have.

32:23.949 --> 32:25.779
That leaves you with two options.

32:26.739 --> 32:29.491
Either you enter witness
protection with your husband,

32:30.609 --> 32:34.479
or I can try and arrange
for you to enter separately.

32:46.691 --> 32:49.136
What should I do?

32:51.575 --> 32:52.890
I guess that depends.

32:53.248 --> 32:55.348
On what?

32:55.851 --> 32:58.270
On how you feel about your husband.

33:04.157 --> 33:06.320
Marcus told me where to find you.

33:07.865 --> 33:10.495
He knew you'd be here.

33:10.849 --> 33:13.736
He remembered this place.

33:13.986 --> 33:15.496
He said, uh,

33:15.854 --> 33:17.339
you used to vacation here?

33:17.956 --> 33:19.917
Yes.
After your marriage.

33:20.292 --> 33:24.547
It was only six miles away
from our house.

33:24.797 --> 33:27.665
It wasn't much nicer then.

33:30.135 --> 33:32.096
But it had this view.

33:32.471 --> 33:35.473
And... and somehow it was enough.

33:37.242 --> 33:39.728
We were happy here.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.799
And then he took the job,
and we had money,

33:44.049 --> 33:48.571
and we traveled to places
much more beautiful than this.

33:48.821 --> 33:51.806
Places we had dreamed about.

33:55.027 --> 33:57.663
It was never the same.

33:58.030 --> 34:01.450
I didn't know what he did,

34:01.700 --> 34:03.877
but I know it changed him.

34:04.236 --> 34:07.423
It changed me.

34:10.109 --> 34:13.929
I just don't think
a person can go back again.

34:14.279 --> 34:15.831
Maybe not,

34:16.681 --> 34:18.934
but maybe you have a
chance to start over.

34:19.284 --> 34:23.522
And that's one more chance
than most people get.

34:27.391 --> 34:30.612
I know one suitcase isn't much
to take into a new life,

34:30.963 --> 34:32.931
but honestly,

34:33.181 --> 34:36.784
I don't know if you
need to take anything

34:37.152 --> 34:39.830
if you love each other.

35:55.781 --> 35:57.566
Keep those separate for now.

35:58.158 --> 36:00.369
You want to take the stuff
on the left?

36:00.719 --> 36:02.619
Got it?

36:07.226 --> 36:08.344
Hey.

36:08.594 --> 36:09.578
Hey.

36:09.828 --> 36:11.013
I thought you cancelled the goodwill.

36:11.263 --> 36:13.424
I did. Then I, uh, un-cancelled it.

36:13.799 --> 36:14.850
Want a coffee?

36:15.100 --> 36:16.600
Sure.

36:19.012 --> 36:21.432
So, when did you have a chance
to go through all those boxes?

36:21.807 --> 36:23.225
I didn't.

36:23.475 --> 36:24.659
I just figured

36:24.909 --> 36:26.812
whatever you want to give away
is fine by me.

36:27.179 --> 36:28.263
Really?

36:28.513 --> 36:29.732
Yeah.

36:30.215 --> 36:31.667
So, wh-what happened?

36:31.917 --> 36:32.651
What changed your mind?

36:33.018 --> 36:34.987
I slept on it.

36:35.554 --> 36:37.281
And I realized

36:37.656 --> 36:40.284
you don't need a 20-year-old cassette

36:40.659 --> 36:44.163
if you've still got the song.

36:49.126 --> 36:50.319
All right, you busy tonight?

36:50.569 --> 36:51.420
No.

36:51.770 --> 36:53.822
Wrong. I'm taking you out.

36:54.072 --> 36:54.757
Really?
Mm-hmm.

36:55.106 --> 36:57.009
Where?
It's a surprise.

36:57.259 --> 36:59.461
The new Italian restaurant
we've been wanting to try?

36:59.711 --> 37:00.804
Not a new place.

37:02.914 --> 37:04.767
Okay, you've got to give me a clue.

37:05.017 --> 37:06.769
I just did.

37:07.019 --> 37:08.979
I'll see you.

37:19.898 --> 37:21.644
I sent flowers when your kid died.

37:21.894 --> 37:23.619
I don't do flowers for anybody.

37:23.869 --> 37:25.120
Especially not a cop.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.938
It's not something you hand off

37:29.188 --> 37:30.819
like an old coat
that doesn't fit anymore.

37:31.069 --> 37:33.004
I know, Jake.
No, you don't know nothing.

37:34.254 --> 37:36.799
You try to buy me off
with a couple of Cuban cigars?

37:37.825 --> 37:40.552
Smoking them with somebody
I considered to be a friend...

37:41.830 --> 37:43.028
that's all I cared about.

37:43.278 --> 37:44.264
You're right.

37:44.514 --> 37:45.968
You're absolutely right.

37:46.516 --> 37:48.227
That's why I'm here to apologize.

37:48.627 --> 37:50.020
You were a friend.

37:50.270 --> 37:51.944
You are a friend still.

37:53.357 --> 37:56.193
And I'm gonna miss
our dinners together.

37:56.788 --> 37:58.529
All of it.

37:58.779 --> 38:00.864
And if you don't want to work
with Vega, that's your call.

38:01.114 --> 38:03.283
I think he's a good kid.

38:03.696 --> 38:05.661
To be honest with you,
he's the one that pointed out

38:05.911 --> 38:07.663
how badly I messed up with you.

38:07.913 --> 38:08.729
If you're interested,

38:08.979 --> 38:09.916
then we'll do it right.

38:10.166 --> 38:12.747
We'll go out for a nice steak dinner,

38:12.997 --> 38:14.837
and I'll make a proper introduction.

38:15.087 --> 38:16.964
But if not, then so be it.

38:22.294 --> 38:23.887
Tell you what.

38:25.330 --> 38:27.349
Me and the kid,
we'll have dinner alone, okay?

38:27.733 --> 38:28.727
I'm not invited?

38:28.977 --> 38:29.746
No, just me and him.

38:29.996 --> 38:31.303
I mean, if it's gonna be us,

38:31.553 --> 38:32.798
let's see if it can be us, you know?

38:33.048 --> 38:34.762
You know what I mean?
Sure.

38:35.012 --> 38:35.858
By the way,

38:36.241 --> 38:38.986
the, uh, that tip
that I gave you about the crew,

38:39.378 --> 38:40.678
it's a good tip.

38:41.738 --> 38:44.088
I gave you the wrong details, though.

38:45.584 --> 38:48.036
I'll give the kid the right ones.

38:53.154 --> 38:54.654
Okay.

39:02.134 --> 39:04.502
Thanks, my friend.

39:05.036 --> 39:06.055
You take care of yourself.

39:06.305 --> 39:07.681
You, too.

39:10.609 --> 39:12.027
Oregon?

39:12.602 --> 39:14.845
Who lives in Oregon?

39:23.438 --> 39:25.616
Oh, my God.

39:25.866 --> 39:27.643
It looks exactly the same.

39:27.893 --> 39:28.535
Yeah.

39:28.927 --> 39:31.113
Why'd you bring me here?

39:31.496 --> 39:33.916
I guess I thought we could

39:34.282 --> 39:36.085
go back to the beginning, you know?

39:36.335 --> 39:38.212
Where it all started.

39:38.603 --> 39:40.756
When it was just us.

39:46.745 --> 39:49.364
I can't believe that was us.

39:49.614 --> 39:52.634
It's like we were
like different people.

39:52.884 --> 39:55.537
We were so young.

39:55.787 --> 39:58.273
Well, you were young.

39:58.523 --> 40:00.175
I was...
You were cute.

40:00.425 --> 40:01.610
Very cute.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.478
I was persistent.

40:03.728 --> 40:04.988
I had to wrestle you away

40:05.238 --> 40:07.149
from that water-polo-playing jackass.

40:07.399 --> 40:08.325
Lars.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.954
His name was Mars.
Oh.

40:11.204 --> 40:12.133
For the record.

40:12.383 --> 40:14.540
What kind of parents
call their kid Mars?

40:14.790 --> 40:17.459
Well, they happened
to be very nice people.

40:17.709 --> 40:18.679
You know, I wouldn't give yourself

40:18.929 --> 40:20.053
too much credit for being persistent.

40:20.303 --> 40:21.964
I was the one who came up to you.

40:22.214 --> 40:23.707
Actually, you went around

40:23.957 --> 40:25.701
asking everyone where your towel was,

40:25.951 --> 40:28.303
and I came up to you
and gave you my towel.

40:28.653 --> 40:29.671
You know that's not how...

40:29.921 --> 40:31.421
Yeah.

40:34.304 --> 40:35.686
Well, I'm glad you did.

40:37.467 --> 40:39.567
Me, too.

40:40.966 --> 40:42.584
I do remember we started talking,

40:42.834 --> 40:45.637
and we just talked and talked.

40:45.887 --> 40:47.489
Sat right over there.
Mm-hmm.

40:47.839 --> 40:51.059
By the time we looked up,
they'd closed the pool.

40:51.309 --> 40:52.870
You remember
what happened after that?

40:53.245 --> 40:55.289
What we did next?
No.

41:00.952 --> 41:02.252
Yes.

41:03.130 --> 41:05.022
I forgot about that.

41:08.527 --> 41:09.827
Hey.

41:11.496 --> 41:12.556
What do you think?

41:18.395 --> 41:19.156
No.

41:19.406 --> 41:20.093
No,

41:20.343 --> 41:22.934
it's crazy talk.
I'm not...

41:23.320 --> 41:24.568
Yeah, what, you're scared?

41:32.651 --> 41:34.151
Oh...

41:37.438 --> 41:39.083
Are you sure about this?

41:40.251 --> 41:41.751
Nope.

41:46.975 --> 41:48.275
One...

41:50.385 --> 41:51.435
Two...

42:11.556 --> 42:12.442
Oh, that's new.

42:12.692 --> 42:13.909
Come on.

42:21.366 --> 42:23.235
Stand by that thing;
I'll go and get the clothes.

42:23.485 --> 42:24.628
No, let's just run for the car.

42:24.986 --> 42:26.880
My keys are in my pocket.

42:27.238 --> 42:28.206
Hey, Michael.

42:28.456 --> 42:30.426
What?
I love you.
