00:45.323 --> 00:46.152
Oh no!

00:46.167 --> 00:47.402
Our sled's broken!

00:47.589 --> 00:49.409
Hey, let's build one out of snow!

00:50.308 --> 00:51.316
What are you doing, Jake?

00:53.370 --> 00:54.737
Sleds are for suckers.

00:54.753 --> 00:56.112
Just ride on my gut.

00:56.143 --> 00:56.839
Okay!

01:02.416 --> 01:03.361
Switch!

01:09.093 --> 01:10.554
Switch back! Switch back!

01:12.460 --> 01:13.390
Penguins!

01:19.049 --> 01:21.862
I'm a flying dog!

01:23.674 --> 01:25.433
Ahah! Mathematical!

01:25.628 --> 01:26.597
What?!

01:26.745 --> 01:29.534
Who dares enter the Ice Kingdom?!

01:29.612 --> 01:31.503
Aww, Ice King's here.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.831
You know <i>why</i> I'm here?

01:33.847 --> 01:37.355
Do you know what "Ice King" means?!

01:37.503 --> 01:39.112
Yeah, I know what "Ice King" means...

01:39.144 --> 01:41.011
A big nerd!

01:41.050 --> 01:42.886
Oh ho oh! Holy cow!

01:42.910 --> 01:45.886
It means I'm King of Ice!

01:45.964 --> 01:47.996
This is my domain!

01:48.019 --> 01:50.714
And you are violating Ice World law...

01:50.737 --> 01:52.237
...trespassing!

01:52.354 --> 01:55.244
Come on, brother!
We're just trying to beat the heat.

01:55.260 --> 01:57.971
Yeah! There's a big sleeping
lava man in our front yard,

01:58.034 --> 01:59.628
and he is <i>so</i> hot!

02:00.838 --> 02:01.901
Wait, wait, no, I take it back.

02:01.948 --> 02:04.206
I don't mean, like, "sexy" hot.

02:04.237 --> 02:06.948
No, no, you <i>do</i> mean "sexy" hot.

02:06.948 --> 02:07.745
No, I mean...

02:07.761 --> 02:08.768
I don't care!

02:08.800 --> 02:10.518
This is my kingdom.

02:10.566 --> 02:15.542
You guys can't just scoot about on my
land willy-nilly.

02:15.558 --> 02:17.003
I've got rules here.

02:18.073 --> 02:19.753
Why don't you just try being cool?

02:19.769 --> 02:20.370
What?!

02:20.394 --> 02:21.792
I am the king!

02:21.806 --> 02:25.252
I am the king of c-cool c-co ca...

02:26.501 --> 02:27.962
That's it!

02:28.001 --> 02:31.134
Rise monsters of snow

02:31.149 --> 02:34.243
and go beat up Finn and Jake!

02:47.822 --> 02:48.486
Huh yeah!

02:48.501 --> 02:50.048
Oh man, that was great!

02:50.079 --> 02:51.939
Ooh, you guys are gonna get it.

02:51.962 --> 02:53.204
Yeah, right, sure.

03:00.206 --> 03:02.034
I need a magic back.

03:04.495 --> 03:05.448
Trail mix.

03:07.847 --> 03:08.956
Ooh, yogurt chip.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.160
Aww man.

03:16.019 --> 03:17.761
I'm back home!

03:18.433 --> 03:19.738
Hello, ladies!

03:24.113 --> 03:27.261
Now, now. I've brought you a baby...

03:27.277 --> 03:29.527
...and a puppy.!

03:32.535 --> 03:34.566
Finn! Are you okay?

03:34.613 --> 03:36.230
Huh, Wildberry Princess?

03:36.277 --> 03:37.543
Hot Dog Princess?

03:37.566 --> 03:39.199
W-what's goin' on?

03:39.222 --> 03:41.027
We're all prisoners, Finn.

03:41.050 --> 03:42.050
Ice King!

03:42.081 --> 03:42.542
What?

03:42.761 --> 03:44.933
Why are you keeping these
girls prisoners, jerk?

03:44.956 --> 03:46.253
You don't understand!

03:46.339 --> 03:50.003
I collect princesses because
I want to marry one.

03:50.073 --> 03:53.386
Well, why'd you capture six of them
if you just want to marry <i>one</i> ?

03:53.417 --> 03:56.862
I'm collecting them all first to
be sure I make the right choice.

03:56.901 --> 03:59.026
You're both too young to understand,

03:59.034 --> 04:02.308
but marriage is a serious thing
and lasts forever.

04:02.573 --> 04:04.948
You can't just rush into it, you know?

04:05.018 --> 04:07.042
Ice King, don't do this.

04:07.135 --> 04:08.385
Just let the girls go.

04:08.643 --> 04:10.752
They <i>don't</i> want to be here.

04:10.776 --> 04:11.940
Of course they do!

04:11.964 --> 04:14.597
I would have killed them already
if they didn't want to be here.

04:14.659 --> 04:16.096
Right ladies?

04:19.878 --> 04:21.425
Don't worry, princesses.

04:21.589 --> 04:25.386
I pledge that Jake and I will protect
each and everyone of you

04:25.409 --> 04:26.581
and furthermore...

04:26.604 --> 04:31.628
I see all of you happily married to whatever
sweet thing y'all want to be married to!

04:34.285 --> 04:37.527
Rad! All I need is something
to spear the Ice King with.

04:37.543 --> 04:38.473
Binoculars...

04:38.488 --> 04:39.387
Toothbrush...

04:39.402 --> 04:40.270
Water bottle...

04:40.285 --> 04:41.003
Quilt...

04:41.035 --> 04:41.801
Sweater...

04:41.809 --> 04:42.590
Trail mix...

04:43.106 --> 04:43.973
My flute!

04:49.361 --> 04:50.455
My flute!

04:50.478 --> 04:52.611
Aw, nuts, dude!

04:52.627 --> 04:55.994
You broke it when we tried picking
the lock to that sad ogre's heart!

04:56.009 --> 04:56.619
Darn it!

05:02.087 --> 05:03.892
Nice try, boy!

05:03.985 --> 05:05.978
Princesses, did you see?

05:05.993 --> 05:08.470
Did you see Finn fail?

05:08.509 --> 05:09.564
Don't worry, Finn.

05:09.759 --> 05:11.680
I'll get us out of here with...

05:11.712 --> 05:12.689
...Key Hand!

05:13.642 --> 05:14.587
Oh, no you won't!

05:16.665 --> 05:17.579
Jake!

05:17.610 --> 05:18.298
Eat it.

05:18.321 --> 05:18.954
I...

05:19.095 --> 05:19.907
...I'm okay.

05:20.063 --> 05:21.072
Ice King!

05:21.095 --> 05:22.947
You better either set us free

05:22.962 --> 05:24.509
or come in here and fight me

05:24.556 --> 05:25.533
'cause otherwise...

05:25.556 --> 05:27.267
...I'm gonna <i>flip out</i>!!!

05:28.266 --> 05:30.540
Oh, are you trying to hit me?

05:30.587 --> 05:34.275
Well, excuse me because
I have to go potty in the bathroom.

05:35.774 --> 05:36.790
ICE KING!!!

05:36.829 --> 05:37.587
Finn!

05:38.829 --> 05:39.430
Huh?

05:39.626 --> 05:40.899
Jake, you alright?

05:40.954 --> 05:42.079
I'm fine, buddy.

05:42.149 --> 05:44.142
Calm down and tend to the princesses.

05:44.202 --> 05:45.249
Oh my gosh.

05:45.578 --> 05:46.727
I'm sorry, princesses.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.672
Slime Princess, are you alright?

05:48.704 --> 05:50.461
He's held us here for weeks,

05:50.469 --> 05:54.017
questioning us about our favorite
sports and quirky behavior.

05:54.048 --> 05:55.892
I've tried to tell him
as little as possible.

05:55.892 --> 05:57.181
I understand.

05:57.236 --> 06:00.032
And, Lumpy Space Princess,
how to you fair?

06:00.056 --> 06:02.884
I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun.

06:02.908 --> 06:05.462
What? Not having any fun?

06:05.720 --> 06:07.916
But last night I read you the story of

06:07.931 --> 06:10.095
"Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince."

06:10.369 --> 06:12.587
That wasn't fun. That was lame.

06:12.697 --> 06:15.416
Other princesses,
do you feel the same way?

06:18.838 --> 06:21.173
Well, here, watch. I'll show you.

06:21.205 --> 06:22.940
We'll have some fun.

06:22.971 --> 06:24.299
Fun's my middle name.

06:26.799 --> 06:28.775
Here, now, Wildberry Princess.

06:28.791 --> 06:30.791
I need you to play this.

06:30.854 --> 06:32.572
I don't know how.

06:32.744 --> 06:34.611
Well, come here, I'll teach you.

06:34.807 --> 06:36.830
Put your hand through the bars...

06:36.861 --> 06:38.924
Atta princess, and uh...

06:40.603 --> 06:42.048
I don't think I can.

06:42.071 --> 06:43.501
Just play it like I showed you.

06:43.517 --> 06:44.627
Leave her alone, Ice King!

06:44.650 --> 06:47.220
PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!!

06:47.236 --> 06:48.244
Oh dear!

06:49.165 --> 06:51.157
Yeah, keep playing it.

06:51.329 --> 06:54.071
Now everyone pick up an instrument
and play it.

06:54.087 --> 06:55.962
Oh, this is going to be so much fun!

07:11.137 --> 07:12.293
What are you thinking, Finn?

07:12.582 --> 07:14.347
I've almost devised a plan.

07:14.621 --> 07:18.105
I'm gonna let him drum till' I've
finalized the details in my mind.

07:18.129 --> 07:19.035
Sweet!

07:32.335 --> 07:34.163
Oh, that was fun!

07:35.046 --> 07:36.960
Ah! It <i>was</i> fun!

07:37.194 --> 07:39.538
Hey, you should get some more fun stuff.

07:39.562 --> 07:41.179
You're right! Good idea, Finn.

07:41.312 --> 07:43.546
"Good idea," indeed.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.546
I hope they think I'm fun.

07:47.155 --> 07:49.451
Alright. I've got a plan on
how to get out of here.

07:49.506 --> 07:53.335
First everyone needs to be dancing
and laughing and saying fun stuff like

07:53.365 --> 07:54.131
“Whoopee!”

07:54.154 --> 07:56.178
Okay, when the Ice King comes back,

07:56.208 --> 07:59.372
everyone play it up, like we want him
to come inside the jail and party with us

07:59.435 --> 08:01.099
and when he steps inside...

08:01.748 --> 08:03.560
I'm gonna beat the tar out
of him with these

08:03.708 --> 08:05.193
...while you all take care of Jake.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.599
Everyone on board with this?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.591
Sweet! Nice plan, dude!

08:09.872 --> 08:12.747
I think by everyone saying "Whoopee"
the plan won't work

08:12.773 --> 08:14.139
cause he'll know we're faking it.

08:14.304 --> 08:15.500
Good point, LSP.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.343
I'm gonna say something fun like

08:17.421 --> 08:19.601
"Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time!

08:19.625 --> 08:22.586
Oh my gosh, havin' the best time
I've ever had in my entire life!"

08:22.656 --> 08:24.688
Make way for the fun tray!

08:25.305 --> 08:26.648
Whoa, what's happening?

08:28.063 --> 08:30.157
...probably the best time I've ever
had in my whole life...

08:31.133 --> 08:33.328
..so much fun!

08:33.774 --> 08:34.429
What is this?

08:34.453 --> 08:35.554
We're having fun!

08:35.703 --> 08:36.586
Whoopee!

08:37.672 --> 08:38.749
Because I left the room?

08:38.773 --> 08:40.023
Because they like it here.

08:40.109 --> 08:41.491
Because they like you.

08:41.538 --> 08:43.475
Because you're a really fun guy!

08:43.562 --> 08:45.274
I don't get this.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.961
He's not buying it. Dance harder.

08:49.735 --> 08:51.532
Come on in here and party.

08:51.758 --> 08:53.313
Wanna dance with us, Ice King?

08:53.399 --> 08:54.337
Come on!

08:54.696 --> 08:57.969
Really? You want to dance with me?

08:58.079 --> 09:00.055
Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo!

09:00.720 --> 09:01.712
Wow...

09:02.282 --> 09:06.266
Yes! Yes! Whoopee!

09:07.407 --> 09:08.727
Wait, no!

09:08.883 --> 09:10.259
Don't leave!

09:10.539 --> 09:12.242
I'll kill you all!

09:13.531 --> 09:15.172
Why are you doing this?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.687
Everyone was finally warming up to me.

09:17.859 --> 09:19.711
No! That is not the case!

09:19.890 --> 09:21.406
You're nuts, man!

09:21.523 --> 09:22.898
And I don't know <i>how</i> to help you!

09:22.927 --> 09:24.804
Probably because I'm just a simple dude.

09:25.241 --> 09:27.757
So maybe you should talk to someone
with more life experience...

09:27.772 --> 09:28.326
...like Jake!

09:28.342 --> 09:29.889
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn,
what are you doing?

09:29.897 --> 09:31.467
Don't dump the Ice King on me!

09:31.489 --> 09:33.435
But you gotta get it in you're head, man!

09:33.482 --> 09:35.935
Putting princesses in jail is wrong!

09:36.795 --> 09:41.912
Finn, you just ruined my chances
with 5 or 6 potential wives!

09:42.014 --> 09:43.756
For that you will...

09:44.928 --> 09:45.920
Oh, my beard.

09:49.709 --> 09:52.280
Why do people not like me?

09:53.248 --> 09:56.084
Is it because I'm a magic user?

09:56.428 --> 09:59.295
Or is my beard too shaggy?

10:00.162 --> 10:03.631
I try so hard to be a
good husband for girls.

10:04.092 --> 10:06.264
What's wrong with me?

10:08.139 --> 10:08.935
Hoo.

10:08.967 --> 10:10.758
You're a sociopath.

10:10.928 --> 10:11.944
Who are you?

10:12.858 --> 10:14.108
I know...

10:14.154 --> 10:16.037
You're probably a...

10:16.076 --> 10:19.420
...a big nerd!

10:20.177 --> 10:23.256
Why don't you try being cool like me?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.544
Star dust is so ticklish!

10:31.950 --> 10:32.723
What happened?

10:33.020 --> 10:34.247
Princesses?

10:39.723 --> 10:41.605
Thank you for saving us, Finn.

10:41.614 --> 10:43.168
You're welcome, Slime Princess!

10:43.207 --> 10:47.528
And remember when you vowed to
marry us to the thing of our choosing?

10:47.536 --> 10:48.598
Yeah...

10:48.645 --> 10:49.739
Well...

10:49.755 --> 10:51.942
I'd like to marry you.

10:54.872 --> 10:57.739
Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that...

10:57.950 --> 10:58.903
Jake, help me!

11:00.450 --> 11:03.333
Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn.

11:03.364 --> 11:05.122
He pees his pants constantly.
