on "Still The King"--

00:04.200 --> 00:06.733
- Yes.
- MAN: She said yes!

00:06.833 --> 00:09.333
- I vow to never leave your side
for the rest of our lives,

00:09.433 --> 00:10.367
even when
you're in the bathroom.

00:10.467 --> 00:11.700
- [metal tinging]

00:11.800 --> 00:13.967
- I would do anything
to get my ass back inside.

00:14.067 --> 00:15.567
- We work for the SEC.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.667
- You guys were right about Coy.
I'm ready to play ball.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.633
What is the dirt on that marina?

00:19.733 --> 00:22.467
- I was trying on my wedding
dress, and when I turned around,

00:22.567 --> 00:24.567
he kissed me.
- You ever hear the saying,

00:24.667 --> 00:26.033
"Speak now or forever
hold your peace"?

00:26.133 --> 00:29.367
- * If I didn't love you,
I wouldn't be me *

00:29.467 --> 00:30.900

I don't need nobody.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.000
Vernon Brown's a damn solo act.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.733
- [gunshot]

00:46.833 --> 00:49.133
- Hey, boy.

00:49.233 --> 00:51.900
You're trespassing
on private property.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.867
- Sorry, Mister.

00:53.967 --> 00:56.600
I'm just trying
to clear my head.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.567
- Uh, I got something
that'll clear your head.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.567
- [gunshot]

01:04.900 --> 01:08.733

01:12.700 --> 01:13.867
* It's two a.m.

01:13.967 --> 01:15.533
* The fear has gone

01:15.633 --> 01:19.900
* I'm sitting her waitin',
the gun's still warm *

01:20.067 --> 01:24.500
* Maybe my connection is tired
of taking chances *

01:24.600 --> 01:28.233

01:28.333 --> 01:31.500
* Help I'm steppin'
into the twilight zone *

01:31.600 --> 01:33.400
* The place is a madhouse

01:33.500 --> 01:35.467
* Feels like being cloned

01:35.567 --> 01:37.300
* My beacon's been moved

01:37.400 --> 01:39.833
* Under moon and star

01:39.933 --> 01:41.267
* Where am I to go

01:41.367 --> 01:44.333
* Now that I've gone too far

01:44.433 --> 01:47.867

02:10.433 --> 02:12.633
- What are you doing?

02:12.733 --> 02:16.067
- Oh, Debbie.

02:16.133 --> 02:17.567
- Oh.

02:17.667 --> 02:20.067
Look who's decided to join
the land of the living.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.067
[laughs]

02:22.133 --> 02:24.067
Come on, squirrels' done.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.800
Mm-hmm.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.533
- Smells delicious.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.367
Thank you, Mister.
- It's my pleasure.

02:29.467 --> 02:33.333
And like I said last night,
call me Leslie.

02:33.433 --> 02:35.433
Go on and take the first bite.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.067
- Mm.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.700
- Mind the buckshot.
- [spits]

02:41.800 --> 02:43.967
- I don't mind it.
It's worth it.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.400
- Good way to get your iron.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.133
- Hey, I owe you an apology
for however I ended up here.

02:48.233 --> 02:49.600
- Ain't no apologizing
necessary.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.600
Man, we had a hell of a time
last night.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.900
We drank some whiskey,
we sang some songs.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.900
We killed them squirrels.

02:57.067 --> 02:59.333
We styled each other's hair.

02:59.433 --> 03:01.300
We went skinny dipping.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.767
- Huh?

03:02.867 --> 03:05.200
- I don't know you,
but thanks for coming.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.600
- Congratulations, Ronnie.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.667
Don't worry, statistically
speaking, you're slightly less

03:08.767 --> 03:11.433
likely to get abducted by aliens
and probed than get a divorce.

03:11.533 --> 03:13.633
- Thanks for putting it
that way.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.733
Vance. [laughs]

03:16.833 --> 03:19.067
- Ronnie, thanks
for making me a groomsmen.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.200
I know we haven't always gotten
along, but that's just 'cause

03:21.300 --> 03:22.867
I hate you
with every fiber of my being.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.600
[laughs]
- Fantastic.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.900
If it wasn't my wedding, I'd
roundhouse you in the throat.

03:27.067 --> 03:30.167
But it is, so I'm gonna smile,
shake your hand,

03:30.267 --> 03:32.733
and say thanks for being here.
[laughs]

03:32.833 --> 03:34.833
Now run along
before I change my mind.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.433
- Okay, everyone,
we have one chance

03:40.533 --> 03:42.867
to take these
sons of bitches down.

03:42.967 --> 03:45.633
- MAN: Go, go, go, go, go!

03:45.733 --> 03:47.533
Go, go!

03:47.633 --> 03:49.133
- [indistinct
police radio chatter]

03:49.233 --> 03:51.933
- I don't know, man, all this
certainly feels like overkill.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.267
- Maybe it is, Jim.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.567
But you know what?

03:54.667 --> 03:57.200
I am sick and tired of being
the laughing stock

03:57.300 --> 03:58.700
of the law enforcement
community.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.433
Just once, I wanna do
the cool things

04:01.533 --> 04:04.200
that the cool guys do
in those cool movies.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.133
Is that so wrong?

04:06.233 --> 04:07.400
- Alright, Gene.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.633
You set all this up.

04:08.733 --> 04:10.133
That's what you really want.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.167
Let's go nail these bastards.

04:16.267 --> 04:17.633
- Strike Team Delta's
in position.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.733
Operation Lasso is underway.

04:21.867 --> 04:25.067
- Okay, I just have to say
something...about Ronnie.

04:25.167 --> 04:28.167
He's just not the smartest guy
in the world.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.967
- But...

04:32.700 --> 04:34.500
- No but, just had to be said.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.767
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- [laughs]

04:38.867 --> 04:40.800
- If he makes you happy,
then that makes me happy.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.933
- Oh, that means so much,
sweetheart. Thank you.

04:43.067 --> 04:45.533
- I just don't know if I'll
ever be able to call him dad.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.067
- Yeah, I'd feel weird
about that, too.

04:47.167 --> 04:50.200
- *

04:50.300 --> 04:51.733
- It's almost time.

04:51.833 --> 04:52.533
Are you ready?

04:52.633 --> 04:54.367
- Yeah. [moans]

04:54.467 --> 04:56.167
- Oh my God, oh my God.
Are you okay?

04:56.267 --> 04:57.700
- Uh-huh. Oh.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.767
It's been over 16 years, but
you never forget the feeling.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.400
That, ladies, was a contraction.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.233
- Okay, uh...I've only
seen this on TV.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.300
Are we supposed to freak out?

05:05.400 --> 05:06.667
- No, no,
it's gonna be fine.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.567
It can go on for a while.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.767
I was in labor with John Cougar
for two days.

05:10.867 --> 05:13.533
Little monster came out,
he just bit me on the thigh.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.367
- Alright, let's get this show
on the road, alright?

05:15.467 --> 05:17.500
One child out of wedlock
is plenty.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.533
You know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

05:19.633 --> 05:21.800
I love you.
- I love you.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.333
- Good luck.

05:23.433 --> 05:24.867
- [heavy breathing]

05:24.967 --> 05:26.733
[moaning]

05:34.067 --> 05:36.333
- Even though
it's against my nature,

05:36.433 --> 05:38.467
let me help you get dressed.

05:38.567 --> 05:40.067
- You know,
I can't thank you enough

05:40.167 --> 05:41.467
for being my best man, Coy.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.467
- Well, it's an honor.

05:43.567 --> 05:48.233
Besides, we're
in bed together now, Ronnie.

05:48.333 --> 05:52.067
To me, that makes us family.

05:52.133 --> 05:57.567
- And family always looks out
each other, right, Coy?

05:57.667 --> 06:00.733
- Absolutely.

06:00.833 --> 06:04.367
- And now I'm
looking out for you.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.667
Mwah.

06:10.433 --> 06:15.067
- Debbie...oooh,
you're a luck girl.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.267
- You kept going on and on
about some gal named Debbie.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.533
Debbie, Debbie.

06:20.633 --> 06:22.833
You must have done
something really bad.

06:22.933 --> 06:25.167
- I told my girl I loved her.

06:25.267 --> 06:27.333
She slapped my face
in front of the whole world.

06:27.433 --> 06:31.067
- That is humiliating.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.067
If that happened to me,
I'd probably just go lay down

06:33.133 --> 06:36.367
on the railroad tracks
and call it a day.

06:36.467 --> 06:37.800
- I appreciate the advice.

You look so pretty though.

you are under arrest

08:46.833 --> 08:49.800
for securities fraud,
for investment advisor fraud,

08:49.900 --> 08:51.400
and for mail fraud.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.367
- Well, that's preposterous.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.067
You can go tighter with those.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.933
- Ronnie, what
the hell is this?

get me to take the fall.

But the joke's on him.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.367
He's going down,

09:02.467 --> 09:04.367
- That is in no way correct.

- [indistinct chatter]

09:10.633 --> 09:11.733

09:11.833 --> 09:13.533
I put cufflinks up my butt.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.333
- We never asked you to do that.

09:15.433 --> 09:16.467
You ruined those cufflinks.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.767
The deal was is that
we lessen your sentence.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.667
There's no scenario in which
you don't go to jail.

- [sighs] Is there nothing
you can do to get her back?

10:14.767 --> 10:16.967
- [sighs]
I'm afraid I'm a damn fool

10:17.067 --> 10:21.767
for not holding onto her
when I had the chance.

10:21.867 --> 10:24.267
- She was my gal.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.033
I loved her.

10:26.133 --> 10:29.033
But I had to run around
like a young buck,

10:29.133 --> 10:31.467
screwing every fawn
and forest animal

10:31.567 --> 10:33.000
that crossed my path.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.833
- Now that's just a hypothetical
analogy, correct?

10:35.933 --> 10:38.267
- [sighs] Yeah.

10:39.867 --> 10:45.133
Well, she married
some corporate jackass.

10:45.233 --> 10:47.000
The worst.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.867
First, I was able to
contain myself and hold it in.

10:50.967 --> 10:54.033
But eventually, the heartache
just shattered me,

10:54.133 --> 10:56.800
and I did something
I can't never undo.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.600
- What'd you do?
Kill the son of the bitch?

10:58.700 --> 11:00.067
- No.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.633
Jesus, is that where
mind went first thing?

11:02.733 --> 11:03.800
- Anyway, go ahead.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.100
- Ain't nothing to go on from.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.633
I sold all my possessions,
I moved out here,

11:07.733 --> 11:09.833
I never looked back.

11:09.933 --> 11:11.733
But there is not a single day
that goes by

11:11.833 --> 11:14.667
that I do not regret
letting her go.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.867
- Vernon, Debbie's in labor.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.767
- You mean
she's having the baby?

11:19.867 --> 11:20.967
- That's what labor means.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.767
Uh, yes, come on, let's go.

11:22.867 --> 11:24.333
- Well, how'd you
find me out here?

11:24.433 --> 11:26.400
- You called me last night,
told me where you were

11:26.500 --> 11:29.567
in case some guy
named Leslie murdered you.

11:29.667 --> 11:33.100
- Leslie, I gotta--
- WALT: Who are you talking to?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.067
- The guy.
- What guy?

11:35.100 --> 11:37.767
- Uh...he's gone.

11:37.867 --> 11:38.767
Anyway, come on.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.300
Let's go see my son.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.100
Come on.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.633
- Phew, the squirrel
goes right through you.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.233
Where'd he go?

11:50.433 --> 11:51.367
Was he real?

11:51.467 --> 11:52.533
- Ohhh!

11:52.633 --> 11:54.300
[heavy breathing]

11:54.400 --> 11:56.433
- Are you going for
natural childbirth?

11:56.533 --> 11:58.567
- If by natural you mean
I actually want every modern

11:58.667 --> 12:01.300
medicine and chemical innovation
that might be pressing

12:01.400 --> 12:03.800
a watermelon-sized object
through my hoo-ha less painful,

12:03.900 --> 12:05.067
thank God.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.500
- The epidural it is.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.533
- Debbie, I got a little
flower situation going on here.

12:08.633 --> 12:12.067
I've got some white candidums,
some white--needle.

12:12.133 --> 12:14.733
- [heavy breathing]
- VERNON: Where is he?

12:14.833 --> 12:16.433
Is he here?
Did I miss it?

12:16.533 --> 12:17.933
- Does it look like
you missed it?

12:18.067 --> 12:19.067
[moaning]

12:19.167 --> 12:20.500
- What are your plans
for the placenta?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.067
- I hadn't really
thought about it, Walt.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.533
- Well, keep me posted.

12:23.633 --> 12:26.800
- Look at all us here together
to welcome our new family member

12:26.900 --> 12:28.500
into this world.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.867
I mean, it's exactly
like I pictured it.

12:30.967 --> 12:34.133
Minus Kaitlynn, Walt, and Doily.

12:34.233 --> 12:35.867
- Really glad
you're here, Vernon.

12:35.967 --> 12:37.467
- You don't seem all that glad.

12:37.567 --> 12:38.733
- No, I am.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.067
I just--I really wish
Ronnie were here, you know?

12:41.167 --> 12:43.533
I mean, this is as much
about him as it is about you.

12:43.633 --> 12:45.833
Ohh! Whoo!

12:45.933 --> 12:47.900
- Nurse, how much longer
to go time?

12:48.067 --> 12:50.700
- Uh, still a couple hours
probably.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.800
- Whoo!
Vernon, our baby here yet?

12:52.900 --> 12:55.100
- Still don't know if it's
Vernon's, but you definitely

12:55.200 --> 12:56.900
don't have anything
to do with it, Doily.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.167
- Your baby, our baby.

12:58.267 --> 12:59.433
It takes a village, Debbie.

12:59.533 --> 13:02.133
- Oh, Ronnie's missing this,
but Doily's here?

13:02.233 --> 13:03.700
How is this fair?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.267
[heavy breathing]

13:05.367 --> 13:07.667
- Guys, can we talk
in the hallway real quick?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.867
I need you to use
your law enforcement juice

13:10.967 --> 13:14.200
to get Ronnie out of jail.
- [laughs]

13:14.300 --> 13:17.867
Well, securing the release
of a newly arrested felon

13:17.967 --> 13:20.467
is beyond
even my powerful influence.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.967
You'd have better luck
just breaking him out.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.267
- You think what I'm thinking?

13:26.367 --> 13:29.100
- I think for the first
time ever, my escape tunnel.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.067
- Your tunnel.
- I can't hear this.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.733
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

13:35.767 --> 13:39.933
- [indistinct police radio]

13:40.067 --> 13:41.467
- Hello?

13:41.567 --> 13:43.400
- Oh, hi.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.567
- *

13:49.333 --> 13:54.833
- Um, excuse me, sir,
my car is smoking and hot.

13:54.933 --> 13:56.367
- Just like its owner.

13:56.467 --> 13:57.967
- *

13:58.067 --> 13:59.633
- Take a little look...

13:59.733 --> 14:01.900
under the hood.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.133
- Thank you.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.200
Yeah, it sounded like
a heart pounding.

14:05.300 --> 14:10.067
Just pounding over and over
and just over again.

14:10.167 --> 14:11.767
- [clears throat]
- You know?

14:11.867 --> 14:16.233
- *

14:16.333 --> 14:18.400
- Looks like he took the bait.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.633
Come on, let's go.
- I should go get my tools.

14:20.733 --> 14:22.267
- No, you can just
use your hands.

14:22.367 --> 14:23.933
- Where's that dang hole
of yours?

14:24.067 --> 14:25.200
- I am good with my hands.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.900
- Yeah, I can tell.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.533
- *

14:29.633 --> 14:31.833
- It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

14:31.933 --> 14:33.333
Last place I looked--

14:34.967 --> 14:36.733
Found it.
- If you say so.

14:36.833 --> 14:40.067
Let's do it.
- Come on.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.667
- You're doing good.
Still on schedule.

14:41.767 --> 14:44.833
- ALL: Ah!

14:44.933 --> 14:47.167
- Oh my God, this is the best
form of birth control!

14:47.267 --> 14:49.900
- Ah, I would kill
for a shot of tequila.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.300
- Oh.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.433
Just say the word.

14:52.533 --> 14:53.600
- Oh, ah!

14:53.700 --> 14:56.933
- The second that baby is out,
it is all yours.

14:57.067 --> 14:58.233
- Sympathy swig.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.433
- [motor purring]

15:01.533 --> 15:04.567
- *

15:10.700 --> 15:12.067
- It looks like
you're having a little

15:12.133 --> 15:14.067
car trouble there, Ma'am.
- Back off! I'm handling this.

15:14.167 --> 15:15.367
- Hold on.

15:15.467 --> 15:17.067
I'm actually an ASEA-1
certified mechanic so--

15:17.133 --> 15:19.067
- Why are you wearing a tuxedo?

15:19.133 --> 15:20.733
- [laughs] I work on fancy cars.

15:20.833 --> 15:24.067
- Oh, so you're an ASEA-1
certified mechanic?

15:24.100 --> 15:25.600
- Mm-hmm.

15:25.700 --> 15:26.833
- Really?

15:26.933 --> 15:28.700
Well, tell me this.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.067
What's that?

15:30.100 --> 15:31.200
- Well, that's the--

15:31.300 --> 15:34.600
- [grunting]

15:44.367 --> 15:47.533
- Oh my God...that was so hot.

15:47.633 --> 15:48.567
Carmen?

15:48.667 --> 15:49.833
- Yeah?

15:49.933 --> 15:52.433
- [speaking Spanish]

16:08.133 --> 16:12.867
- *

16:26.333 --> 16:27.933
- What the hell--

16:28.067 --> 16:29.500
- Hey, we come in peace.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.267
- What you doing in here?

16:31.367 --> 16:34.633
Walt, you coming
to break me out?

16:34.733 --> 16:36.467
- Actually, we're looking for
a new fish named Ronnie.

16:36.567 --> 16:37.900
You know him?
- You want Ronnie?

16:39.433 --> 16:40.733
Yo, Ronnie.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.533
- Oh, Hank,
what can I do you for?

16:45.633 --> 16:48.200
Oh, geesh, Vernon, what are you
in for this time?

16:48.300 --> 16:49.400
- I'm here for you.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.933
- Whoa, like I told
that Aryan leader,

16:51.067 --> 16:52.700
Ronnie is nobody's bitch.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.067
- Listen, Deb's
about to have the baby.

16:55.167 --> 16:56.333
Gonna be here any minute.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.333
She wants you there.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.267
I want what's best for her.
Come on.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.367
- Deb's having my baby?

17:02.467 --> 17:04.533
What took you all so long?
Let's crawl!

17:04.633 --> 17:07.733
- *

17:07.833 --> 17:09.367
- Great.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.067
Getaway car won't get away.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.067
- [engine turns over]

17:18.100 --> 17:19.233
- I'm trying.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.067
- Let's make a run for it.

17:21.133 --> 17:22.867
- Run 15 miles to town?

17:22.967 --> 17:24.933
Debbie'll have
a third kid by then.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.133
- Another kid?

17:26.233 --> 17:27.767
- Going my way, boys?

17:27.867 --> 17:29.067
- Doily!

17:29.133 --> 17:31.167
I thought you said you couldn't
be a part of this?

17:31.267 --> 17:32.933
- I'm not a part of anything.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.833
I'm just a lonely driver
looking for the company

17:34.933 --> 17:36.867
of some kindly hitchhikers.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.967
- I'm kindly ready
to get the hell out of here.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.067
Come on!

17:40.100 --> 17:41.367
- Let's do this, dude!

17:41.467 --> 17:42.600
- *

17:42.700 --> 17:44.400
* Set up camp
in the center of town *

is my own my Tom Sawyer *

18:07.467 --> 18:09.733
* Death, he's coming
to destroy her *

18:09.833 --> 18:12.500
* I never wanna die, and I

18:12.600 --> 18:13.767
- Dad, Dad, Ronnie,
she's in there!

18:13.867 --> 18:16.867
Go, go, go, go, go.

18:16.967 --> 18:18.433

whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.333
Only the father's
allowed during the birth.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.300
- BOTH: That's me.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
- Deb, did we make it?

18:24.500 --> 18:25.400
- Ronnie?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.667
How are you here?

18:26.767 --> 18:28.633
- Well, it turns out
Vernon's not a total jerk.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.100
Busted me out of jail.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.733
- Jail? Wait, what?

18:31.833 --> 18:32.933
- It's just a saying.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.833
Stay focused
on the task at hand.

18:34.933 --> 18:37.400
- DEBBIE: [moaning]
You two are such idiots.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.467
Oh, but I'm glad
you idiots are here.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.067
[screams]

18:41.133 --> 18:43.600
- Here he comes.
- VERNON: Here he comes.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.567
- RONNIE: Push, Deb.
- VERNON: Come on, Deb, push.

18:49.867 --> 18:53.067
- [sighs] You think
anything's happened yet?

18:53.133 --> 18:55.967
- No, I think
they'll tell us when.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.267
- [sighs]

18:57.367 --> 18:58.467
How 'bout now?

18:58.567 --> 18:59.567
- Are you all family?

18:59.667 --> 19:00.933
- ALL: Yes!

on this baby!

19:07.300 --> 19:10.867
- *

19:17.400 --> 19:18.767
- He's beautiful.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.367
Just like his mama.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.267
- *

19:22.367 --> 19:24.500
- I made this for him.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.933
- Walt, you shouldn't have.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.767
- *

19:28.867 --> 19:31.167
- Protect him from
electromagnetic waves.

19:31.267 --> 19:33.267
- And it says UTI.

19:33.367 --> 19:34.633
Thank you.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.067
Let's save that.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.300
- Oh, what do you
wanna name him?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.967
- Vernon Junior.
- Ronnie Junior.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.200
- It's Daniel, after my father.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.300
- *

19:45.400 --> 19:48.067
- BOTH: Daniel.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.067
- Uh, no rush, but if you want
that paternity test now,

19:51.100 --> 19:53.500
I can have the results today.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.500
- [machine beeping]

19:58.600 --> 19:59.600
- What do you think?

19:59.700 --> 20:01.967
- [baby cooing]

20:06.367 --> 20:08.100
- Look at that.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.100
Miracle of childbirth.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.967
- Truly is miraculous.

20:14.067 --> 20:17.633
- That's what miracle
means, dumbass.

20:17.733 --> 20:18.833
You know, I've been
doing some thinking.

20:18.933 --> 20:21.500
- Oh, don't hurt yourself.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.267
- That baby might be mine.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.967
It might be yours.

20:26.067 --> 20:30.033
But regardless,
Charlotte's my daughter.

20:30.133 --> 20:34.467
So...even though I'm gonna be
moving out of the house,

20:34.567 --> 20:37.567
half if not more of that family
is mine.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.233
So I ain't going anywhere.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.767
- Mm. Yeah?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.567
Well, there's a flip side
of that coin, amigo.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.867
Sure, the baby might be yours.

20:46.967 --> 20:49.700
But I'm marrying Deb,
and I'm gonna be her husband.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.133
So I ain't
going anywhere neither.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.767
In any case, thanks.

20:55.867 --> 21:00.233
Congratulations on being
a possible dad, you has-been.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.067
- Back at you, [bleep].

21:04.333 --> 21:06.700
- I imagine you folks
wanna take a look at this.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.967
It's the results
to the paternity test.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.133
- No whammies, no whammies,
no whammies.

21:21.633 --> 21:23.833
- Good news is it's one of you.

21:23.933 --> 21:26.533
- Come on, Deb,
you're toying with us.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.900
- DEBBIE: Alright.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.167
It's you.

21:32.267 --> 21:34.733
- *

21:38.200 --> 21:40.433
- But eventually the heartache
just shattered me,

21:40.533 --> 21:43.267
and I did something
that I can't never undo.

21:43.367 --> 21:45.233
- What'd you do?
Kill the son of a bitch?

21:45.333 --> 21:46.433
- No.

21:46.533 --> 21:49.400
Jesus, is that where your mind
went first thing?

21:49.500 --> 21:50.633
- Not first.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.233
I mean, first I thought you
probably killed him

21:52.333 --> 21:53.567
and hung his [bleep]
on the wall.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.467
But the way you got all these
asses hanging up here--

21:56.567 --> 21:58.333
it's what he deserved.
- It is.

21:58.433 --> 22:00.567
I was too much
of a [bleep] to do, I guess.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.900
- You should have.

22:02.067 --> 22:03.867
- VANCE: I hate you
with every fiber of my being.

22:03.967 --> 22:05.067
- RONNIE: Fantastic.

22:07.167 --> 22:09.133
- *
