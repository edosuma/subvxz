00:07.675 --> 00:09.277
And we'd like to welcome you
to our screening

00:09.343 --> 00:10.844
of the celebrated
six-part, 1980s,

00:10.911 --> 00:13.914
Romanian Television series,
Comrade Detective.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.916
Similar to American
propaganda films

00:15.983 --> 00:19.720
like Red Dawn and Rocky IV
that demonize the Eastern Bloc,

00:19.787 --> 00:22.623
Comrade Detective
was produced and funded

00:22.690 --> 00:25.893
by the Romanian government,
not merely to entertain,

00:25.959 --> 00:29.530
but to celebrate and promote
Communist ideals.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.533
But with the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.968
Comrade Detective would
tragically become nothing more

00:35.035 --> 00:38.539
than a curious footnote in the
dustbin of a Communist history.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.907
Until now.

00:39.973 --> 00:43.811
After a two-decade journey
spanning four continents,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.646
hundreds of dead-end leads,

00:45.713 --> 00:49.517

international governments,

we have finally tracked down
and restored

00:52.553 --> 00:54.855

and dubbed them.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.858
This has been one of the most
rewarding experiences.

00:57.925 --> 01:01.262
I am incredibly proud to bring

14:52.159 --> 14:54.027
COVACI:
He's a detective

14:54.094 --> 14:57.230
from the small farming village
of Rasinari.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.733
Great, he's a goat fucker. Okay.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.236
He was good friends with Nikita.

15:03.303 --> 15:07.207
They were on the national
wrestling team in their youth.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.542
As soon as he heard
of Nikita's death,

15:09.609 --> 15:13.180
he pulled strings--
merit-based strings, mind you--

15:13.246 --> 15:16.216
and had himself transferred
here to the city.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.219
If they were such good friends,

15:19.286 --> 15:21.588
why didn't Nikita
ever mention him?

15:21.654 --> 15:22.789
Hmm?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.391
Do me a favor, Captain,

15:24.457 --> 15:27.360
send this goat fucker
back to the country.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.896
(chuckles)

15:29.963 --> 15:32.932
Not unless...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.368
you go with him.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.008
He's your new partner.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.379
Hey! Stefan!
(mock grunting)

15:46.446 --> 15:48.015
(cackles)

15:48.081 --> 15:50.117
What's up, farm boy?

15:50.183 --> 15:52.085
Look who drew the short straw.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.988
Who got themselves
partnered up with Anghel.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.923
-(cackles)
-No, actually,

15:56.990 --> 15:59.859
I asked to work
with Detective Anghel.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.428
Your funeral, pal.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.862
(men laugh)

16:02.929 --> 16:04.297
(smooches)

16:06.899 --> 16:09.836
Everybody in here now!
Let's go!

16:09.902 --> 16:12.172
Watch that slippery sp...

16:16.909 --> 16:18.778
COVACI:
For fuck's sake.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.713
Tipsy, calm down. Let's go.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.055
COVACI:
Everyone sit down and shut up.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.389
Especially you two.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.761
All right, we have some guests.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.631
I want you all to meet
Detective Joseph Baciu,

16:38.698 --> 16:42.535
who's come here to help find
Nikita's killer.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.505
We're not used to crime
in Romania.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.075
It's not part
of our national character.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.678
And so we find ourselves
completely overwhelmed.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.913
Which brings us
to our second guest--

16:53.980 --> 16:56.316
Victor... Dinca?

16:56.383 --> 16:59.352
-Victor. -Victor Dinca
is a Secret Police officer

16:59.419 --> 17:01.754
sent from the 9th Division.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.423
-(excited chatter) -What the
fuck kind of name is Dinca?

17:03.490 --> 17:06.226
-Who is this asshole?
-COVACI: Quiet. Quiet.

17:06.292 --> 17:09.396
He is our Romanian brother,
and he is on our side.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.364
Yeah.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.700
Remember that separately...

17:13.766 --> 17:16.603
we are like this.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.605
But together...

17:18.671 --> 17:22.309
-we are more like this fist!
-Fist!

17:22.375 --> 17:24.010
-Fist! -Fist!
-Fist!

17:24.077 --> 17:25.444
-Fist! -Fist! -Fist!

17:25.512 --> 17:27.280
-Fist! -Fist!
-Fist! -Fist!

17:27.347 --> 17:31.551
-Fist! -Fist!
-Fist!

17:45.465 --> 17:48.067
We should get up to speed.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.203
Yesterday I visited
the crime scene...

17:50.270 --> 17:53.106
Aw, fuck. Nice move.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.043
Mm, he should've thought
that move through.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.612
Now he lost his queen.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.682
You're gonna teach me
about chess, Kasparov?

18:02.749 --> 18:03.850
His queen's fine.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.018
He's employing
the King's Indian Attack.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.354
Watch and learn.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.323
(audience exclaims on TV)

18:10.390 --> 18:12.159
ANNOUNCER: Oh.
That could cost him the game.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.830
(sniffs)

18:17.897 --> 18:20.733
Look, I know
this must be difficult for you.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.203
Nikita was your partner,
he was your friend.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.704
I get that.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.839
You don't get anything.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.380
I knew Nikita since we were 14.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.415
We traveled
all over the world together

18:35.482 --> 18:37.083
competing
in wrestling tournaments.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.253
We even went to New York City
once, if you can believe that.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.090
He was the closest thing

18:44.157 --> 18:47.093
I ever had to a brother.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.730
And I will find his killer,
Detective.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.233
With or without you.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.273
Nikita had an informant.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.643
And it was this informant
who set us up.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.278
Now I'm looking through
all of Nikita's files

19:05.345 --> 19:07.480
to try to figure out
who this guy was.

19:09.782 --> 19:13.186
Also, I've got a handwritten
note from the killer.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.355
Knock yourself out.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.728
Now that you're up to speed,

19:21.794 --> 19:23.363
kindly go fuck yourself.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.437
Detective Anghel.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.406
Detective Anghel!

19:35.442 --> 19:37.310
Detective Anghel!

19:38.545 --> 19:40.547
I'm talking to you, Detective!

19:40.613 --> 19:42.048
(grunts)

19:42.114 --> 19:44.183
Touch me again, I'll kill you.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.952
You understand?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.821
Look in my hand, Detective.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.496
I found that at the crime
scene-- it was overlooked.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.765
"Jordachi."
What is Jordachi?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.132
It's not "Jordachi."
It's English.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.969
The "E" is silent.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.005
It's pronounced Jordache,

20:06.072 --> 20:07.540
which would make this American.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.576
You're implying
the killer's American.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.344
Well, that would certainly
explain the Reagan mask

20:11.411 --> 20:13.546
the killer was wearing.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.784
But what is this?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.852
No idea.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.937
(phone ringing,
indistinct chatter)

20:38.004 --> 20:40.873
MAN (shouting nearby):
You're fired!

20:40.940 --> 20:42.542
MAN 2:
Shut up.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.610
MAN:
Hey, what's up with the...

20:43.676 --> 20:46.813
MAN 2:
Oh, brother!

20:46.879 --> 20:48.281
Bucharest PD.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.517
We're here to see
the American ambassador.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.018
Do you have an appointment?

20:52.084 --> 20:55.522
We're the police.
We don't need an appointment.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.625
(chuckles) Well, if you want
to see the ambassador,

20:58.691 --> 21:01.027
you need to be in this book.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.062
Hmm. Okay.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.230
Hey, hey! Oh, okay.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.633
-Uh...
-(Gregor humming)

21:09.101 --> 21:12.238
There. Now I'm in the book.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.641
Hmm, that's really mature,
Detective,

21:14.707 --> 21:18.177
but I'll have you know
that the ambassador is very busy

21:18.244 --> 21:19.879
spreading freedom
and democracy.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.915
More like spreading greed
and gonorrhea.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.017
Pardon my partner, ma'am.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.453
Please, let the ambassador know

21:26.519 --> 21:29.322
we'd like to speak with her
when she has a moment.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.729
What is wrong with you?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.565
How do you expect
to get any answers

21:38.631 --> 21:40.867
when you're coming in here
like a bull in a China shop?

21:40.933 --> 21:43.370
You'd rather sit here
with your dick in your hand?

21:43.436 --> 21:46.238
Is that your thing, Detective?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.241
Just be patient.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.977
(man burps)

21:51.043 --> 21:53.480
(Gregor sighs)

22:06.426 --> 22:09.028
WOMAN:
Ugh. You just wasted

22:09.095 --> 22:10.329
a very good Twinkie.

22:10.397 --> 22:13.032
But I suppose
it's your lucky day.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.768
The ambassador has agreed
to see you.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.709
(doors creaks open)

22:25.478 --> 22:27.947
Madam Ambassador.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.586
Madam Ambassador.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.624
WOMAN:
Yoo-hoo!

22:37.690 --> 22:42.028
(with Southern accent):
Come on in, have a seat, y'all.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.490
(Gregor clears throat)

23:15.695 --> 23:19.231
I'm Ambassador Sally Smith.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.133
How might I help you?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.636
I'm Detective Gregor Anghel,

23:23.703 --> 23:27.440
and this is Detective Joseph,
uh...

23:27.507 --> 23:30.009
Baciu, like, the shepherd.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.180
Uh...

23:34.246 --> 23:35.848
thank you for seeing us.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.551
We're investigating the murder

23:38.618 --> 23:41.754
of fellow detective
Nikita Ionescu.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.723
Murder?

23:43.790 --> 23:46.993
I'm not sure
y'all came to the right place.

23:47.059 --> 23:51.564
Tell me, Ambassador, you ever
seen anything like this before?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.365
Jordache?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.635
Sure.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.037
They're just jeans.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.539
Who's Gene?

23:59.606 --> 24:03.976
You know, jeans,
like blue jeans?

24:04.043 --> 24:05.444
Pants.

24:08.114 --> 24:12.351
Clearly, you two gentlemen have
never been to Beverly Hills.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.220
(laughs)
Jane,

24:14.286 --> 24:15.788
be a doll.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.157
You're wearing a pair
of Jordache jeans, aren't you?

24:18.224 --> 24:20.827
Yes, ma'am.

24:20.893 --> 24:24.731
Why don't you give
the detectives a closer look?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.941
(chuckles)

24:35.007 --> 24:37.209
Hmm.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.848
(clears throat)

24:41.914 --> 24:43.616
(laughs)

24:44.951 --> 24:48.988
Now, don't tell me
you two strong men are afraid

24:49.055 --> 24:52.792
of a silly thing
like a pair of ladies jeans.

24:52.859 --> 24:56.428
The killer left behind this
label from one of these jeans.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.430
That means your friend Jane here

24:58.497 --> 25:00.700
has just become
a person of interest.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.903
Every woman in this embassy
owns a pair

25:03.970 --> 25:05.905
of Jordache jeans, Detective.

25:05.972 --> 25:09.241
You'd have to haul us all in.

25:09.308 --> 25:10.643
Maybe we will.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.445
Two words--

25:13.512 --> 25:16.916
diplomatic immunity.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.218
Tell us what you know
about Nikita's murder.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.520
I don't know anything.

25:21.588 --> 25:24.691
Tell us what you know
about Nikita!

25:24.757 --> 25:26.793
-(Jane gasps)
-Get out of my office now!

25:26.859 --> 25:29.361
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

25:29.428 --> 25:31.230
Commie prick.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.302
Get the fuck out.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.006
And y'all don't come back,
ya hear?

25:40.072 --> 25:42.174
-(phone ringing)
-I'm so sorry, Ambassador.

25:42.241 --> 25:46.212
-Thank you for...
-Ah, you, too, you little worm.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.047
(phone continues ringing,
Jane sighs)

25:48.114 --> 25:50.316
(Sally groans)

25:50.382 --> 25:53.119
-Hello?
-(Sally sighs)

25:53.185 --> 25:56.789
It's for you.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.826
Jane?
(sighs)

25:59.892 --> 26:01.427
Ah.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.162
Would you go grab me a Pepsi?

26:03.229 --> 26:04.731
A Diet Pepsi.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.099
And try not
to fuck it up this time.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.636
Bless your heart.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.841
Oh.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.844
Smith.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.512
Hmm.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.049
The problem was just here.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.053
Are you crazy, Detective?

26:27.119 --> 26:30.022
They told me
your methods were unorthodox,

26:30.089 --> 26:32.725
but you practically started
World War III in there!

26:36.295 --> 26:38.965
You don't understand
what we're dealing with, do you?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.833
You want to catch an American?

26:40.900 --> 26:43.369
You need to think
and act like one.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.876
The ambassador's
appointment book?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.278
You stole it?
Without a warrant?

26:52.344 --> 26:55.648
Like I said, if we want
to catch Nikita's killer,

26:55.715 --> 26:57.950
we need to act like Americans.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.987
And that means being underhanded
and breaking the rules.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.989
You're in Bucharest now, baby.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.857
You think you can handle that?

27:04.924 --> 27:07.393
You suggest
we compromise our methodology?

27:09.261 --> 27:14.100
No, I'm suggesting we nail
these motherfuckers to the wall.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.678
It's incredible how many times

27:25.745 --> 27:28.114
she can visit a beauty salon
in a week.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.882
We're talking
about a capitalist.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.584
Narcissism is as important
as air to these assholes.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.554
Oh, here's something
interesting.

27:35.621 --> 27:38.590
Between 7:00 and 9:00 p.m.,
she has nothing scheduled.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.226
Absolutely nothing.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.593
Maybe she's resting.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.295
I don't know.
She's staying in.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.331
You said
we had to think like Americans.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.333
Americans don't just rest
or stay in.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.769
Time is their most precious
commodity.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.637
What's their favorite saying?

27:51.704 --> 27:53.605
Time is money.

27:53.672 --> 27:57.609
Exactly. Time is money.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.946
She's doing something
during this time

28:00.012 --> 28:01.948

28:02.014 --> 28:04.683
Well, let's find out
what she's up to.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.760
Hey, Troy, you got a light?

28:18.765 --> 28:21.768
Man, did you see the American
football game last night?

28:21.834 --> 28:24.236
So many passes.

28:28.174 --> 28:31.510
These late nights are not gonna
please my wife.

28:31.577 --> 28:35.214
No. You got yourself a milkmaid

28:35.281 --> 28:37.149
back on the farm
in Rasinari, huh?

28:37.216 --> 28:40.987
No. I brought her here,
along with our two children.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.023
A boy and a girl--
Flavia and Andrei.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.960
You've got a milkmaid and kids,

28:48.027 --> 28:50.729
and you still asked
for this case?

28:53.833 --> 28:56.335
Nikita would have done the same.

28:57.636 --> 29:00.139
Oh.

29:10.682 --> 29:14.686
What the...?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.688
What is she wearing?

29:16.755 --> 29:19.158
She's dressed like a prostitute.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.899
(engine starting)

29:30.502 --> 29:32.504
She's a capitalist, Gregor.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.507
Isn't calling her
a prostitute redundant?

29:35.574 --> 29:37.409
Yeah, it is that.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.812

the diplomatic immunity card.
