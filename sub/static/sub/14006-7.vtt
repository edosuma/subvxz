00:01.550 --> 00:03.850
Previously on damages...

00:04.260 --> 00:07.260
Still swears she didn't kill her fiance?

00:07.270 --> 00:09.210
Someone tried to kill me.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.850
Who?

00:10.860 --> 00:12.480
Did you identify the body?

00:12.490 --> 00:13.470
There was no body.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.370
Well,that's impossible.

00:15.380 --> 00:16.750
It's about the case.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.390
The frobisher case?

00:20.680 --> 00:23.340
Do yourself a
favor,Ellen,don't have kids.

00:23.350 --> 00:26.520
I think you resent me,

00:26.800 --> 00:30.010
- but that doesn't justify your behavior.
- Dude!

00:30.340 --> 00:31.430
Mom.Mom!

00:31.440 --> 00:35.460
First seven days,your son is allowed
absolutely no contact with the outside world.

00:36.530 --> 00:38.200
I'd love for you to join me.

00:38.210 --> 00:42.130
I need somebody I can trust,and you'd
make a valuable addition to the team.

00:42.140 --> 00:46.570
Gregory malina dumped his frobisher
stock the exact day arthur frobisher did.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.050
We have to bring him in.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.630
Tom,draft the subpoena.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.110
Do you understand the risk I'm
taking talking to you right now?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.730
Remember me from the other night?

00:53.740 --> 00:55.940
Of course I remember you.

01:00.110 --> 01:02.120
Your boy--
gregory malina?

01:02.130 --> 01:03.100
Yes?

01:03.110 --> 01:04.250
He's in danger.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.370
I want to talk to him.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.690
He doesn't talk to
you.You know how it works.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.300
You need to leave.

01:08.310 --> 01:10.990
Just give me five minutes,ray.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.730
There's a very important lesson
to be learned from all this.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.830
Trust no one.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.220
Someone's covering it up.

01:24.230 --> 01:25.650
Who?

01:26.110 --> 01:28.370
The police searched patty's apartment,

01:28.380 --> 01:32.500
and there was no one there
and no signs of a struggle.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.690
but I'm telling you the truth.

01:36.700 --> 01:40.930
Okay,then let's start
with what you know.

01:45.660 --> 01:48.020
David and I had A....

01:51.490 --> 01:55.340
Ellen,talk to me.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.730
Take your time.

02:00.670 --> 02:03.320
David and I had a fight.

02:08.190 --> 02:11.220
so I stayed at patty's apartment.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.990
that's when the man attacked me.

02:16.830 --> 02:20.300
She told me she was going
away for the weekend.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.420
I'd never seen him before.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.700
I don't know who he was.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074

02:43.730 --> 02:46.110
I couldn't trust anyone.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.680
I didn't know what I was doing.

02:51.310 --> 02:53.130
I knew.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.710
I knew I had to find david.

03:14.130 --> 03:16.000
David!

04:03.210 --> 04:07.670
If you want to help me,you've
got to find patty hewes.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.690
It's too heavy.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.420
I said not so heavy.

05:02.430 --> 05:05.000
I think you need more foundation.

05:05.010 --> 05:07.880
- Patty.
- Ray.

05:08.740 --> 05:12.050
I was hoping we'd have a chance
to talk before the taping.

05:13.570 --> 05:15.080
That will be fine,thanks.

05:15.090 --> 05:16.870
Ten minutes before typing

05:16.880 --> 05:19.650
I don't know,ray,i think
you went a little light.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.990
I mean,you and I,we both
have these deep set eyes.

05:23.070 --> 05:27.010
If I don't get a little color
on me,I look like a vampire.

05:27.020 --> 05:29.830
How much sleep do you get,ray?

05:31.150 --> 05:33.090
Why you ask?

05:33.100 --> 05:38.720
I'd say I've been getting about
five hours for the last two decades.

05:39.310 --> 05:42.090
Sounds about right.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.540
So...

05:43.970 --> 05:46.460
what did you have on your mind?

05:48.040 --> 05:50.430
Gregory malina.

05:50.980 --> 05:51.940
Gregory who?

05:51.950 --> 05:53.000
Don't bother,ray.

05:53.010 --> 05:54.170
No bother at all.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.440
So,are you guys making nice in here?

05:56.450 --> 05:58.690
- Well,I know I am.
- Greta.

05:58.700 --> 06:02.490
Thank you both for coming,and,uh,let's
have some fun out there.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.070
Great.

06:04.540 --> 06:06.970
Try a little bronzer,ray.

06:08.950 --> 06:12.990
If anything happens to mr.Malina
before I can depose him.

06:13.770 --> 06:17.270
I'm going to hold you
personally responsible.

06:17.780 --> 06:21.720
What kind of man do
you think I am,patty?

06:56.100 --> 06:57.890
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.You okay?

06:57.900 --> 06:59.200
- Yeah,I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.130
It's okay.Yeah,I'm all right.Thank you.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.190
Gregory malina?

07:04.590 --> 07:05.820
Yeah.How...

07:05.830 --> 07:07.590
You've been served.Good luck.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.130
Excuse me.

07:09.440 --> 07:12.880
Hey,I was wondering.is
it okay if I park there?

07:44.480 --> 07:46.950
Jesus,ray.Knock.

07:49.050 --> 07:52.040
Thought it was best not
to attract attention.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.900
accommodations okay?

07:59.910 --> 08:02.610
Your boss is worth billions--
you stick me in this shithole.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.040
Can't even get espn.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.280
Well,if you hadn't strayed from the last
place,i wouldn't have had to stick you here.

08:07.290 --> 08:08.300
I need air,ray.

08:08.310 --> 08:10.070
I can't stay inside all day.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.240
I've filed a motion
to quash the subpoena.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.010
When I win it,you'll be in the clear.

08:18.050 --> 08:20.870
I just need to know one thing.

08:21.510 --> 08:26.170
Did you ever tell anyone
about the stock sale?

08:26.860 --> 08:27.820
No.

08:27.830 --> 08:30.000
I mean anyone,gregory?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.220
No.No one.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.370
All right,then.

08:38.409 --> 08:40.770
Wait,that's it?You're leaving?

08:41.460 --> 08:43.240
Why,gregory?

08:44.270 --> 08:47.050
You want me to stay?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.970
Don't start with that shit,okay,ray.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.220
I'm just checkin' on you.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.050
I shouldn't even be here.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.600
Wait.

09:05.060 --> 09:08.000
you got any money for the snack machine?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.770
I was told you don't medicate.

09:13.780 --> 09:16.570
That's right.Not
without parental consent.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.450
Well,why aren't they speaking?

09:18.460 --> 09:21.510
We require at least three
hours of silence a day.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.340
It's important that they
turn their thoughts inward.

09:28.140 --> 09:30.140
Do you think michael's
ready to come home?

09:30.150 --> 09:31.490
No.That's up to you.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.440
But we operate on a
month-to- month basis,so.

09:34.830 --> 09:37.140
So you need a decision.

09:37.150 --> 09:41.390
It's hard,I know,but you're going to get a
much better idea after you talk to your son.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.680
Certainly is quiet here.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.220
Yeah,that's the way we like it.

09:47.230 --> 09:50.370
No music,no video games,no computers.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.470
And you say michael has
adjusted to all this?

09:52.480 --> 09:54.070
Absolutely.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.010
I mean,don't get me wrong,he's far
from perfect,but he's a good kid.

09:57.020 --> 09:59.010
He's made a lot of progress.

09:59.510 --> 10:03.120
I think sending your boy here may
have been a wake-up call he needed.

10:03.450 --> 10:05.320
I hope so.

10:12.910 --> 10:14.220
Ellen.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.650
do you think patty has
something to do with this?

10:22.100 --> 10:25.700
She is the only one who knew
I was staying in her apartment.

10:28.940 --> 10:30.040
You were right.

10:30.050 --> 10:32.180
I was playing games with you.

10:32.190 --> 10:35.240
I was very angry,and I was acting out.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.340
Acting out?

10:37.830 --> 10:40.990
You sent me a hand grenade and
almost killed your stepfather.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.640
It was a prank.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.950
It was a mistake.I'm sorry.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.620
Are you eating?Is the food terrible?

10:55.380 --> 10:57.210
It's fine.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.040
They treating you okay?

11:00.050 --> 11:03.090
They treat me the way
I deserve to be treated.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.610
What does that mean?

11:04.620 --> 11:08.570
I brought this on myself.I'm
responsible for my own actions.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.990
- Well,I have a decision to make.
- I know.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.110
The end of the month is coming,and you
need to decide if you want to keep me here.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.250
And?

11:29.770 --> 11:32.090
I want you to come home.

11:32.850 --> 11:34.970
I think that would be a mistake.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.160
Why?

11:37.170 --> 11:38.860
Because I like it here.

11:38.870 --> 11:42.010
Life is simple,no distractions.

11:43.910 --> 11:46.010
Michael,this isn't you.

11:46.020 --> 11:49.450
Well,that was the
point,wasn't it?To change me?

11:49.460 --> 11:50.940
Your behavior,not you.

11:50.950 --> 11:53.170
I didn't send you here
to become someone else.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.200
You sent me here to prove a point.

11:55.210 --> 12:00.300
That you're in control,that you
dominate,that,no matter what,you'll always win.

12:00.310 --> 12:02.550
And you're right,mom,you will.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.290
I've finally realized that.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.030
I don't want to win anything.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.860
Sure you do,and I'm okay with that now.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.970
Getting away from you was the best
thing that could've happened to me.

12:14.980 --> 12:17.460
It gave me clarity.

12:17.890 --> 12:19.490
Did it?

12:20.340 --> 12:23.300
You wanted to completely
control of my life.

12:24.070 --> 12:26.480
so you took away my free will.

12:26.490 --> 12:31.280
Some pretty terrific parenting--
real mother-of-the-year type stuff.

12:31.610 --> 12:35.690
And I'm glad you did
it,because I like it here.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.820
No,you don'T.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.890
You're coming home.

12:48.900 --> 12:52.390
No,I'm not going anywhere.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.250
I've tried to contact her.No
one seems to know where she is.

13:16.620 --> 13:19.520
I'm in conference with my client.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.530
Your client's fingerprints
are all over the murder weapon.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.640
You had no grounds to
take her fingerprints.

13:23.650 --> 13:26.190
We didn't have to,the state already did.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.130
Her application to the bar.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.540
We found her prints in her
fianc's blood on the murder weapon.

13:31.550 --> 13:34.700
Ellen parsons,you're under arrest
for the murder of david connor.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.980
You have the right to remain silent.

13:36.990 --> 13:40.170
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

13:40.180 --> 13:44.560
You have the right to speak to an attorney and
have an attorney present for any questioning.

14:23.820 --> 14:27.170
From me?Around me?Are you crazy?

14:27.180 --> 14:28.150
I think it was more you.

14:28.730 --> 14:32.570
No,it was definitely.my
side should be in my pocket.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.390
I'll just go grab my stuff.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.920
Okay,I'll meet you down
there in ten minutes?

14:37.930 --> 14:40.160
- Cool.
- All right.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.220
Heading out?

14:47.500 --> 14:48.610
Ms.Hewes.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.300
Yeah,we may have some
useful background on gregory.

14:51.310 --> 14:54.220
The manager at his old
restaurant is willing to talk.

14:54.230 --> 14:56.420
And tom asked you to go along?

14:56.430 --> 15:00.130
He thought it made sense because I've met
gregory before,but if you need me to stay here.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.780
No.No,no,no,that's smart.

15:02.790 --> 15:06.520
We need everything we can
get to fight fiske's motion.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.530
Is this a,uh.

15:15.370 --> 15:17.320
hydrangea?

15:17.890 --> 15:20.220
My mother gave it to me.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.170
You and tom have,uh,

15:25.970 --> 15:31.190
really picked up from where you left
off before he was fired,haven't you?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.530
Tom and I have always gotten along.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.560
Do you think he'S.

15:35.570 --> 15:39.190
fully committed to working here again?

15:40.050 --> 15:42.110
As far as I can tell.

15:42.690 --> 15:44.780
How often do you water this?

15:44.790 --> 15:49.520
Not often,as you can see.I
don't have much of a green thumb.

15:51.770 --> 15:54.050
Has tom ever...

15:54.060 --> 15:56.940
approached you outside the office?

15:56.950 --> 15:59.230
Yeah.A few times.

15:59.240 --> 16:03.140
You know,a few weeks ago,he was
thinking of starting his own firm.

16:03.150 --> 16:04.900
I heard.

16:05.070 --> 16:09.530
He was very angry with me.

16:09.860 --> 16:12.240
Well,he hasn't mentioned anything.

16:14.630 --> 16:17.560
I hope he didn't try to hire you.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.740
No.

16:19.990 --> 16:22.390
Should I be offended?

16:26.040 --> 16:28.180
Good luck at the restaurant.

16:29.140 --> 16:31.650
Oh,ellen.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.600
Keep an eye on tom for me,will you?

16:36.140 --> 16:38.920
Let me know how he's doing.

16:40.030 --> 16:41.310
You think I should
have told her the truth.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.640
What else did patty say?

16:42.650 --> 16:45.210
Nothing-- she just asked
if you tried to hire me.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.690
Out of the blue like that?

16:46.700 --> 16:47.880
Basically.

16:47.890 --> 16:50.990
- Oh,jesus,ellen,patty knows.
- What?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.740
Why else would she ask?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.440
How can she?Unless you told her.

16:54.450 --> 16:55.280
I didn'T.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.190
So then we're fine,right?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.040
You didn't mention it to anyone?

16:59.050 --> 16:59.940
No.

16:59.950 --> 17:02.260
- Not andrew or felicia or...
- No!

17:02.270 --> 17:04.609
Tom,I swear,I didn'T.

17:06.660 --> 17:09.220
I'm sorry if I screwed up.

17:09.599 --> 17:13.450
No,no,no.No,you didn'T.We'll
be fine.We're fine.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.800
Come on,let's go.The manager's waiting.

17:19.270 --> 17:25.410
It's been years,but I had this favorite
little haunt just off plaza de la revolucion.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.069
Hola,muchacho.

17:28.390 --> 17:30.760
Thank you,hevelio.

17:30.940 --> 17:33.640
I would appreciate a
little more discretion.

17:33.650 --> 17:35.170
Where's gregory?

17:35.180 --> 17:37.020
You really think I'm
gonna tell you that?

17:37.030 --> 17:39.520
- I think you should.
- Yeah,well,you listen to me.

17:39.530 --> 17:42.230
You are out of your goddamned
mind,going after him like that.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.400
What are you getting
all excited about,ray?

17:44.410 --> 17:48.600
I work for art,not you,and
you're making a big mistake.

17:49.070 --> 17:51.910
We are not animals.There are limits.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.240
Gregory's a liability.He's
lost his nerve.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.080
He's a liability?

17:55.090 --> 17:58.890
Do you have any idea the kind of scrutiny
we'll be under if anything happens to that boy?

17:58.900 --> 18:01.440
You are gonna bring us all
down with this commando shit.

18:01.450 --> 18:06.070
I am not going to let your young friend
sit across a table from patty hewes

18:06.080 --> 18:07.540
and face an inquisition.

18:07.550 --> 18:08.790
He won't have to.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.230
I've filed a motion
to quash the subpoena.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.440
We do have legal
options available to us.

18:13.450 --> 18:16.670
And what if you can't quash it?

18:20.280 --> 18:21.820
What does list do?

18:22.040 --> 18:25.680
List is for programs that you've already
recorded.What are you trying to do,babe?

18:25.690 --> 18:27.860
I want to record greta tomorrow night.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.770
Oh,shit.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.730
What?Wh-what happened?

18:32.740 --> 18:34.780
I just deleted your wild kingdom.

18:34.790 --> 18:36.870
You what?The one about the baboons?

18:36.880 --> 18:37.940
Haven't you watched that?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.300
No,I haven'T.Never mind.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.550
They always replay that stuff.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.100
So tell me,what did you
think about the school?

18:46.380 --> 18:49.880
It was like a cult compound.All
the kids looked like zombies.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.610
Gee,I'm sorry I didn't go with you.

18:51.620 --> 18:52.840
What am I doing here?

18:52.850 --> 18:55.450
Pick programs to record.You
want me to do it for you?

18:55.460 --> 18:57.200
No,I can do it.

18:57.620 --> 18:58.890
But michael is okay?

18:58.900 --> 19:00.600
I don't know.

19:00.610 --> 19:03.090
He is who he is.He
isn't like other kids.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.110
No?What's he like?

19:05.120 --> 19:09.450
He's like me.He knows the place is
bullshit.He doesn't belong there.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.180
So do we bring him back home?

19:11.190 --> 19:13.000
Shit!

19:13.010 --> 19:13.710
Let me do that.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.370
No!I can do it.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.210
- Patty.
- Fine.

19:17.220 --> 19:18.910
You do it.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.650
There.

19:26.340 --> 19:31.160
You know,if he says he wants to stay,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.590
maybe we should listen to him.

19:38.970 --> 19:42.260
Your honor,gregory
malina was in palm beach

19:42.270 --> 19:45.950
with katie connor on june 18, 2002.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.330
Katie connor,who perjured
herself at her own deposition.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.860
Because gregory malina fed her a lie.

19:51.870 --> 19:55.300
Really?And you have,what,an
audio recording of this?

19:55.310 --> 19:56.720
Or videotape?

19:56.730 --> 20:01.180
Mr.Malina suborning perjury is
not relevant to this case,ms.Hewes.

20:01.190 --> 20:03.750
Your honor,it's a clear indication that

20:03.760 --> 20:07.770
gregory malina was a functionary
in arthur frobisher's conspiracy

20:07.780 --> 20:10.160
to defraud his employees
and shareholders.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.650
You have no proof of that.

20:11.660 --> 20:15.690
Your honor,ms.Hewes' claim of
relevance is based solely on a vacation

20:15.700 --> 20:18.460
mr.Malina took to palm beach.

20:18.470 --> 20:22.910
My mother-in-law has a time- share in
sarasota.Perhaps ms.Hewes would like to subpoena her.

20:22.920 --> 20:28.450
We've also spoken to the manager of the
restaurant where gregory malina worked in 2002.

20:28.460 --> 20:34.830
He will testify that a wealthy patron paid
mr.Malina a huge sum of money to go down to florida.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.440
And who was this patron?

20:36.450 --> 20:38.420
I don't know; I'd like
a chance to find out.

20:38.430 --> 20:41.220
Your honor,this is nothing but hearsay.

20:41.230 --> 20:42.710
Perhaps.

20:42.720 --> 20:49.500
What's not hearsay is that mr.Malina
sold over 1,000 shares of frobisher stock

20:49.750 --> 20:53.400
the very same morning that
arthur frobisher dumped his.

20:54.190 --> 20:56.190
You have documentation?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.630
Yes,your honor.

21:08.930 --> 21:13.930
I would very much like to know how
ms.Hewes came upon this information.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.110
You know I'm not required
to disclose that,ray.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.890
The subpoena stands.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.590
Your honor.

21:21.600 --> 21:27.130
And regarding your request,ms.Hewes,to
expedite mr.Malina's deposition--

21:27.480 --> 21:29.240
I'm going to go ahead and grant it.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.510
Thank you,your honor.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.190
Call the next case,please.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.190
Ellen parsons.

21:57.630 --> 22:00.050
Your lawyer's here.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.010
Ellen,I'm so sorry.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.580
I came as soon as I could.

22:11.590 --> 22:14.430
Hollis nye said you wanted to see me.

22:16.100 --> 22:19.780
Tell me everything.Wha-what
happened to david?

22:20.870 --> 22:23.820
You're the only one I can trust.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.670
- Hey.
- Hey!

22:32.680 --> 22:33.900
Deposition?

22:33.910 --> 22:36.220
Nothing but.T minus what now?

22:36.230 --> 22:39.040
27 hours,14 minutes.

22:39.050 --> 22:42.040
I need seconds,damn it!Seconds!

22:44.860 --> 22:46.820
What's wrong?

22:49.230 --> 22:53.210
I think we should
talk to patty.Together.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.910
What do you think?

22:54.920 --> 22:57.620
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

22:57.630 --> 23:00.270
Extraordinarily stupid idea.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.160
Why?

23:02.530 --> 23:05.690
Conscience is a liability,ellen.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.810
You feel guilty,you unburden
yourself,what happens?

23:07.820 --> 23:11.290
You feel better,but the
people you're coming clean to?

23:12.090 --> 23:15.700
Trust me,maintaining
the illusion of loyalty

23:15.710 --> 23:19.030
is far more effective
than admitting the breach.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.190
Nice.Admitting the breach.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.650
Wow,I like that.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.500
What are you two talking about?

23:27.080 --> 23:28.870
Fiduciary ethics.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.130
Gregory malina's stock sale.

23:36.970 --> 23:39.550
Ellen,can I talk to you?

23:39.560 --> 23:42.090
Sure.

23:48.370 --> 23:50.320
Ellen.

23:56.730 --> 23:58.030
Sorry to interrupt.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.190
That's all right.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.220
Ellen,there's something
I need you to address.

24:02.230 --> 24:03.480
Okay.

24:03.490 --> 24:06.590
Can I trust your total discretion?

24:06.600 --> 24:08.110
Of course.

24:08.120 --> 24:12.710
I'd normally give this to
tom,but I think you can handle it.

24:13.330 --> 24:15.860
What do you need?

24:41.690 --> 24:43.660
What is it?

24:52.540 --> 24:54.600
You said we needed to talk,ray.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.050
Huh,not a bad view.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.730
Yeah,well,I wouldn't know.I've
been staying away from the windows.

25:06.220 --> 25:08.830
New york city.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.920
I ever tell you what happened
the week after I moved here?

25:14.530 --> 25:16.690
Blackout,right?

25:17.970 --> 25:20.090
Well,what do you know about that?

25:20.290 --> 25:24.350
Young gregory actually listened
to me every once in a while.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.630
Yeah,well,you told me some
pretty interesting stories.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.260
It was a different city then.

25:31.710 --> 25:34.630
The mayor beame years.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.310
Porn in times square,pickpockets.

25:38.700 --> 25:41.710
Seems almost quaint now.

25:42.580 --> 25:46.300
They say giuliani cleaned
everything up,but...

25:46.310 --> 25:50.220
someone will always find a
new way to cut your throat.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.210
Is that why you came here,ray?

25:53.220 --> 25:55.660
Tell me a history lesson?

25:59.810 --> 26:02.780
You need to disappear.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.410
What are you talking about?

26:07.310 --> 26:10.260
I couldn't kill the subpoena.

26:14.470 --> 26:16.460
So I'll lie.

26:16.470 --> 26:19.000
Look,I just want to get this over with.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.590
That won't work anymore.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.660
Patty hewes knows about your stock sale.

26:23.670 --> 26:25.650
I didn't tell anybody anything.

26:25.660 --> 26:30.880
Whether you did or didn't makes no matter
now,she knows,and there's no way around it.

26:36.490 --> 26:38.340
I'm sorry.

26:38.370 --> 26:42.000
Like you really give
a shit about me,ray.

26:42.640 --> 26:48.340
It makes no sense,and I'm embarrassed
to admit it,but I do actually.

26:53.280 --> 26:58.790
So why don't you do me a
favor,and get the hell out of here.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.280
Where am I supposed to go,ray?

27:02.290 --> 27:05.570
You're young yet.You
can still start over.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.850
I almost envy you the opportunity.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.980
You envy me?

27:11.760 --> 27:17.180
You reach a certain point in
life,and it's too late to change.

27:17.520 --> 27:20.650
You still have time.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.590
I don't know why i
believed you would help me.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.960
I should've seen it.

27:26.970 --> 27:28.800
Seen what?

27:28.810 --> 27:31.140
That your whole life is a lie.

27:43.730 --> 27:47.870
Maybe I'll stay.tell the truth.

27:49.140 --> 27:52.230
That would not be wise.

27:59.770 --> 28:03.750
I cannot protect you anymore,gregory.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.810
Just leave.

28:30.820 --> 28:35.310
Looks like our boy,gregory
malina,is gonna be deposed after all.

28:36.970 --> 28:40.060
Make sure it doesn't
get screwed up this time.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.900
I'll do it myself.

28:43.910 --> 28:45.860
Get out of here.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.880
- Tom,can I...
- Not now,ellen,not now.

29:00.870 --> 29:02.680
I should've just told her the truth.

29:02.690 --> 29:04.260
Why didn't you?

29:04.270 --> 29:09.060
It was instinct.I was
protecting tom.or trying to.

29:10.180 --> 29:12.750
Well,you said that he's
always been good to you.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.300
Why wouldn't you want to protect him?

29:14.310 --> 29:17.050
Because you should never assume that
your boss knows less than you do.

29:17.060 --> 29:22.290
And now if tom goes to patty and tells
her that I lied,then I'm totally exposed.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.140
No,he'd be hanging himself.

29:25.150 --> 29:26.270
Why would he do that?

29:26.280 --> 29:27.910
To protect himself.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.670
If tom thinks that I can't keep a secret,he's
going to want to get to patty first.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.180
Wait.back up.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.640
Why would patty care if
tom tried to hire you?

29:37.650 --> 29:38.960
Who knows?

29:38.970 --> 29:41.250
Patty said to keep an eye on tom.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.800
Then she specifically
pulled me out of his office

29:43.810 --> 29:47.770
and gave me a job that she
would normally give to him.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.240
That's weird.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.050
It's like she doesn't want me
and tom to trust each other.

29:52.060 --> 29:54.870
She's driving a wedge between us.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.070
You know,I think you
may be losing your mind.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.760
The worst part about it is,whatever
she's doing,it's working.

30:00.770 --> 30:02.910
Tom wouldn't even look
me in the eye today.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.220
Everything I did,I felt
like i was trying too hard.

30:05.230 --> 30:06.220
Wait,this is crazy.

30:06.230 --> 30:09.790
Ellen,patty's doing this,tom's
doing that.What do you want to do?

30:10.150 --> 30:12.630
It's not about me.

30:14.170 --> 30:16.870
I have never seen you like this.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.050
Just keep it simple,okay?

30:20.060 --> 30:22.360
You'll feel better if
you tell patty the truth.

30:22.370 --> 30:26.790
If I do,tom will be
pissed,and I need his support.

30:27.050 --> 30:29.110
And then if I don't,and patty finds out.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.120
Just make up your mind,ellen.

30:31.130 --> 30:35.220
You want to play head games like these
people,or do you want to be yourself?

31:10.080 --> 31:12.230
Oh,you got to be kidding me.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.590
Goddamn it.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.830
shit.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.400
Ah,it's good to meet you,gregory.

31:26.870 --> 31:28.770
Patty hewes.

31:29.370 --> 31:31.410
I know who you are.

31:31.880 --> 31:32.470
That guy.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.460
Has been protecting you.

31:37.540 --> 31:40.860
I imagine you're very
confused right now.

31:41.240 --> 31:44.170
A lot of people are
making promises to you.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.480
But trust me,gregory,I am the
only one looking out for you.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.240
Yeah?

31:51.250 --> 31:53.650
What about after I'm deposed?

31:55.320 --> 31:57.720
I know how these things go.

31:57.730 --> 32:01.140
You'll get what you need from
me,and then you'll toss me aside.

32:01.420 --> 32:05.720
We've been keeping you safe,and
we'll continue to do so.

32:05.730 --> 32:09.710
Arthur frobisher's not the
only one with resources.

32:10.740 --> 32:14.880
Gregory,you're not a bad guy.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.550
The people that you are protecting?

32:17.560 --> 32:19.230
They are bad.

32:19.240 --> 32:23.630
They have ruined people's
lives,including katie connor'S.

32:23.640 --> 32:27.260
Look,I...I never wanted that to happen.

32:28.150 --> 32:29.960
Well...

32:30.500 --> 32:33.470
this is your chance to make amends.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.800
You think katie's the only one?

32:35.960 --> 32:39.620
There are 5,000 people
who lost everything.

32:39.630 --> 32:41.590
They deserve justice.

32:41.600 --> 32:45.830
And believe it or not,you're the
only one who can get it for them.

32:48.930 --> 32:51.140
It's time to do the right thing.

32:51.150 --> 32:53.950
Malcolm will escort
you to the deposition.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.360
All you need to do is show up.

32:58.030 --> 33:00.000
and tell the truth.

33:03.970 --> 33:04.970
Documents are all here.

33:04.980 --> 33:07.090
Signature papers are flagged.

33:07.780 --> 33:10.610
Tell tom I'll be back in
time for gregory's deposition.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.570
Where should I tell him you're going?

33:12.580 --> 33:14.850
You'll think of something.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.700
Ms.Hewes?

33:19.740 --> 33:21.900
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

33:24.570 --> 33:29.150
I appreciate your concern,but
I think it's necessary.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.850
Ellen?

33:34.840 --> 33:37.090
This is just between the two of us.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.830
Of course.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.920
Wait,wait,wait,so you can't
tell me where she went?

33:43.930 --> 33:46.480
Or she told you not to tell me?

33:46.490 --> 33:48.010
Tom,it's a personal thing for her.

33:48.020 --> 33:50.780
Patty said it wasn't important
enough for you to worry about.

33:50.790 --> 33:54.180
Not important enough.Those
are the words she used?

33:54.440 --> 33:56.240
Yeah,I think.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.110
Don't-don't-don'T.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.220
don't spin it for me.

33:59.230 --> 34:01.370
What words did she use,exactly?

34:01.380 --> 34:05.010
Look,when patty gets back,why
don't you just talk to her about it?

34:05.020 --> 34:07.330
You said yourself you never
try to guess what's in her head.

34:07.340 --> 34:09.280
Right.

34:10.060 --> 34:12.400
I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.480
Forget about it.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.409
Did you want me to lie?

34:18.420 --> 34:21.239
I could have told you she had a doctor's
appointment,or made something up.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.210
No,honestly,don't,don't worry about it.

34:23.219 --> 34:25.920
Tom,you know me.

34:25.929 --> 34:27.560
I am not playing games.

34:27.570 --> 34:29.420
No,you're doing the right
thing.You're a good soldier.

34:29.429 --> 34:30.780
You're following your orders.It's great.

34:30.790 --> 34:32.880
Don't worry about it,honestly.

34:58.060 --> 34:59.780
What are you writing?

35:00.370 --> 35:01.450
A journal.

35:01.460 --> 35:04.570
They make us write our
thoughts down every day.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.380
I'd like to read that sometime.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.930
It's private.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.560
Any thoughts about me in there?

35:13.570 --> 35:18.030
Next time you rummage through my private
stuff,I'm sure you'll figure it out.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.990
We need to decide,michael.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.130
I already did.I'm staying.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.600
I'm not paying for you to stay here.

35:26.610 --> 35:28.330
Well,I'm not going back with you.

35:28.340 --> 35:31.930
If you won't pay,then I'll
just go somewhere else.

35:31.940 --> 35:32.740
Where?

35:32.750 --> 35:35.670
I don't know.But I'm not coming home.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.610
All right.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.820
Then I've brought you something.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.570
What's that?

35:45.750 --> 35:47.730
Emancipation papers.

35:48.170 --> 35:52.870
Signed and notarized.All they need
is your signature,and you're free.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.490
Emancipation papers?

35:55.980 --> 35:58.930
A full parental divorce.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.580
I've also included a form
to release your college fund,

36:03.590 --> 36:07.010
so if you want to stay here,you
can pay for it yourself.

36:08.580 --> 36:11.140
I'm tired of fighting you,michael.

36:11.420 --> 36:15.190
You sign these papers,and
you're officially on your own.

36:15.200 --> 36:19.250
You want control?You've got it.

36:20.530 --> 36:22.650
You win.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.430
I've tried it my way.

36:28.570 --> 36:30.750
Let's try yours.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.000
This is gregory.Leave a message.

36:43.610 --> 36:46.680
Good.Don't answer the phone.

36:48.170 --> 36:50.270
Take care of yourself.

36:56.150 --> 36:57.040
We on schedule?

36:57.050 --> 36:57.980
Haven't heard otherwise.

36:57.990 --> 36:59.090
Deposition's at 10:00.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.270
And gregory?

37:00.280 --> 37:02.200
We've got eyes on him.

37:05.540 --> 37:07.470
Lookin' sharp.

37:08.210 --> 37:10.250
You sure you can get
me out of here okay?

37:12.820 --> 37:15.170
We'll be fine.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.690
I just realized.

37:19.220 --> 37:22.060
I never thanked you for saving my life.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.550
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:25.670 --> 37:27.500
Right.

37:28.790 --> 37:32.620
Anyway,you should thank patty hewes.

37:34.110 --> 37:35.740
I will.

37:40.150 --> 37:41.910
- Ray.
- Patty.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.840
So,would you care for coffee,tea?

37:49.850 --> 37:51.640
No,I'm good.Thank you.

37:55.110 --> 37:57.080
You ever been deposed?

37:57.090 --> 37:58.550
Easiest thing in the world.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.790
All you gotta do is tell the truth.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.580
After five years,that will be a relief.

38:04.030 --> 38:05.970
We gotta go.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.260
Shit,my watch.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.680
Are you ready to go?

38:51.190 --> 38:55.680
I think your witness
has other priorities.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.730
Gentlemen,i'm afraid we're going to
have to reschedule for another day.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.520
Excuse me.

39:30.940 --> 39:32.860
I don't know what to say.I lost him.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.710
Then find him.

39:38.750 --> 39:41.020
Goddamit!

40:01.830 --> 40:02.750
Can we clear the air,please?

40:02.760 --> 40:05.390
Ellen,not now.This gregory
thing is a disaster.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.780
We really need to talk.

40:06.790 --> 40:08.880
We need to work.

40:09.150 --> 40:10.860
Tom,this is bullshit.

40:10.870 --> 40:13.230
Get out of my office.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.270
We need each other.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.500
From day one you've had my back.You're
the only reason I have a job here.

40:18.510 --> 40:21.220
I would never do
anything to betray that.

40:21.230 --> 40:23.850
Did you tell patty that
I tried to hire you?

40:23.860 --> 40:25.560
No,I didn'T.I already told you that.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.280
I wouldn't lie about
something like that.

40:27.290 --> 40:28.720
Yeah,but since then.

40:28.730 --> 40:31.590
No,I didn'T.Did you?

40:31.600 --> 40:34.060
You know the answer to
that-- of course not.

40:34.340 --> 40:35.910
We need to make a decision right now.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.620
We're either gonna trust
each other,or we're not.

40:38.630 --> 40:41.150
There's no in between.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.880
You're absolutely right.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.260
Well,you can trust me.

41:03.270 --> 41:05.050
Can I trust you?

41:09.230 --> 41:11.090
100%.

41:17.530 --> 41:20.010
I need you to find patty.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.130
Nobody knows where she is.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.830
But you always know where to find her.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.820
That's why I think she...she
doesn't want to be found.

41:26.830 --> 41:29.010
Yeah,but why?

41:29.740 --> 41:33.770
I don't know,but fiske
really,really got to her.

41:36.630 --> 41:40.420
It sounds like you were
the last person to see her.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.460
Help me.

41:44.470 --> 41:47.280
Ellen,I'm not a defense attorney.

41:47.290 --> 41:50.050
But hollis nye used to be
one of the best in the city.

41:50.060 --> 41:53.530
Please,tom.I...I need your help.

41:55.670 --> 41:58.130
I'll do anything i can for you.

42:03.540 --> 42:07.030
I've been thinking about
it,and I feel as though I...

42:07.040 --> 42:09.100
I need to be honest with you.

42:09.620 --> 42:13.000
when I was thinking
about going out on my own,

42:13.340 --> 42:16.830
I asked ellen to come and work with me.

42:19.550 --> 42:22.690
Thank you,tom.I appreciate that.

42:23.170 --> 42:27.110
Ellen doesn't need to know
about this conversation.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.350
Keep an eye on her.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.510
Let me know how she's doing.

42:34.550 --> 42:36.190
I'm not here for myself.

42:36.200 --> 42:41.190
I'm here as a spokesperson for 5,000
victims of arthur frobisher's greed.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.700
Care to respond?

42:42.710 --> 42:46.210
Greta,this is simply class warfare,

42:46.220 --> 42:49.530
a crass attempt by ms.Hewes
to extort as much money

42:49.540 --> 42:51.870
- Phil,is that you?
- as possible From my client.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.700
The extortionist here
is arthur frobisher.

42:54.710 --> 42:56.500
He milked his company dry.

42:56.510 --> 43:02.570
Not according to the 12 upstanding citizens
who exonerated my client after that witch.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.330
Well,hello.

43:10.580 --> 43:12.520
Hey.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.390
Welcome home.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.910
Hungry?

43:37.380 --> 43:39.010
Starving.

43:39.020 --> 43:41.010
You want a sandwich?

43:41.360 --> 43:43.450
I'll make you a sandwich.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.840
Doesn't matter when you
don't have the evidence.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.490
Nor does it matter when the
accused is guilty as sin.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.820
Mr.Fiske,why isn't this case settled?

43:56.090 --> 43:58.330
You'll have to address
that question to ms.Hewes.

43:58.340 --> 44:02.790
My client has tried to be
reasonable,but he was rebuffed.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.220
Patty?

44:04.230 --> 44:08.120
Mr.Frobisher tried to get off
cheap,and we respectfully declined.

44:08.130 --> 44:09.930
How's the case going?

44:10.390 --> 44:13.440
Great.It's going great.

44:13.450 --> 44:15.230
They want their day in court.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.860
And when I've lined up my witnesses
and my evidence in front of a jury,

44:19.870 --> 44:22.300
the facts will speak for themselves.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.470
Hey,it's me.I just saw ellen.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.770
You better not come back here,patty.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.190
Mr.Nye,Tom just left.

44:38.320 --> 44:41.270
He's full of shit.Stay on him.

44:41.930 --> 44:43.570
He'll lead you to patty.
