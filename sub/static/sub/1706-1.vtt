00:43.710 --> 00:46.372
We were once a peaceful race

00:46.463 --> 00:49.955
of intelligent, mechanical beings.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.008
But then came the war

00:53.095 --> 00:56.633
between the Autobots,
who fought for freedom

00:56.723 --> 01:00.215
and the Decepticons,
who dreamt of tyranny.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.180
Overmatched and outnumbered,

01:06.275 --> 01:08.937
our defeat was all but certain.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.240
But in the war's final days,

01:25.335 --> 01:28.122
one Autobot ship escaped the battle.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.829
It was carrying a secret cargo,

01:30.924 --> 01:33.757
which would have changed
our planet's fate.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.391
A desperate mission.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.102
Our final hope.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.496
A hope that vanished.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.090
One up there. One over there.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.300
And one more down there.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.595
What you got?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.730
Impact detected.

02:39.451 --> 02:44.411
We have impact confirmed.
Contact at 2250 GMT.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.905
What?

02:47.417 --> 02:49.578
Get me SecDef on the phone
right away.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.097
Mr. McNamara,
the President is expecting you.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.728
Get Bobby in here.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.273
Mr. President, designation, top secret.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.521
We believe a UFO has crashed
into the Moon.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.773
We think the Russians are onto it
as well.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.355
Well, then you tell NASA
to move heaven and earth.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.656
We need to get to the moon.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.700
We're going to attempt
a manned mission.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.698
NASA said it would take five years.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.780
You get there before the Russians.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.366
I believe that this nation
should commit itself

03:31.837 --> 03:33.247
to achieving the goal

03:34.214 --> 03:35.704
before this decade is out

03:36.341 --> 03:39.959
of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the Earth.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.169
Ignition sequence start.

03:42.431 --> 03:47.721
Five, four, three, two, one.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.392
All engines running.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.845
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.649
Thirty-two minutes past the hour.
Liftoff on Apollo 11.

03:56.862 --> 04:00.901
Neil Armstrong reporting Apollo 11
on proper heading.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.403
Apollo 11 is on the way, riding that

04:03.493 --> 04:04.528
pillar of flame

04:04.619 --> 04:09.238
from the Saturn V out there,
250, 000 miles away,

04:09.332 --> 04:11.197
where the moon is waiting

04:11.293 --> 04:13.409
for man 's first arrival.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.250
Houston, you're a go for landing. Over.

04:19.341 --> 04:22.800
Forty feet, down two and a half.
Picking up some dust.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.010
Thirty feet, two and a half down.
Faint shadow.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.882
Capcom, flight.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.936
Four forward. Drifting to the right a little.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.266
Down a half.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.853
Contact light.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.317
Okay, engine stop.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.278
Houston,

04:42.532 --> 04:44.818
Tranquility Base here.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.366
The Eagle has landed.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.156
We copy you down, Eagle.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.033
You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.372
We're breathing again.

04:55.170 --> 04:58.788
Perhaps 400 million persons
are watching this broadcast today

04:58.882 --> 05:03.216
of the greatest event in our time
and one of the great events

05:03.303 --> 05:05.294
of all recorded history.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.880
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.550
Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.225
That's one small step for man,

05:17.234 --> 05:20.067
one giant leap for mankind.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.315
- Are we good?
- Yes, sir.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.318
Unofficial time on the first step, 109. ...

05:32.374 --> 05:35.332
Apollo 11? This is Houston, over.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.911
Eagle, we're getting
a signal interference. Do you copy?

05:40.966 --> 05:42.706
We now have had confirmation

05:42.801 --> 05:43.916
of loss of signal

05:44.427 --> 05:45.837
from the Apollo 11.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.842
The Apollo 11 is, at the moment,
on the far side of the moon.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.349
Neil, you are dark on the rock.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.355
Mission is a go.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.850
We have 21 minutes.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.732
My God.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.906
It's some sort of giant metal face.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.449
Jesus.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.116
Control, we are inside the ship.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.255
Extensive damage.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.958
Way too big to check the entire ship.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.137
Everything's dead in here, Houston.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.058
No signs of life anywhere.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.013
These things are massive.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.606
We copy. You've got seven minutes
on your oxygen.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.066
We are not alone after all, are we?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.944
No, sir. We're not alone.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.192
Go ahead, Mr. President.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.871
Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I'm talking to you by telephone

07:37.958 --> 07:40.540
from the Oval Room
at the White House.

07:40.835 --> 07:45.579
And this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.793
I just can't tell you
how proud we all are of you.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.880
For every American, this has to be
the proudest day of our lives.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.928
Because of what you have done. ...

07:58.019 --> 07:59.600
We have splashdown.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.262
....the heavens have become a part

08:02.357 --> 08:03.938
of man 's world.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.316
For one priceless moment

08:08.697 --> 08:10.312
in the whole history of man

08:12.033 --> 08:15.400
all the people on this Earth
are truly one.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.030
One in their pride
in what you have done.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.625
It inspires us to redouble our efforts

08:24.713 --> 08:28.297
to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.367
My hero needs to wake up.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.757
What is that?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.930
This is your new lucky bunny.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.394
It's a beautiful thought, Carly,

09:29.486 --> 09:31.852
but I don't think
it's the whole bunny that's lucky.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.732
You see, it's just this section here.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.398
You see,
it's just the rabbit foot that's lucky.

09:38.078 --> 09:42.538
Well, it's just a good luck charm.
To help you think positive?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.406
Today's important.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.784
Come on, get up.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.995
- Hey, wear that nice tie.
- Yeah.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.168
You need any money for lunch?

09:53.676 --> 09:57.510
No, I don't need any money for lunch.
I have money from yesterday's lunch.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.801
You love it, don't you?
I'm just your American boy toy.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.424
A lover boy toy.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.431
You know how demoralizing it is
to have saved the world twice

10:05.522 --> 10:06.762
and still be groveling for a job?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.097
People don't know
you saved the world, Sam.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.978
I mean, I do. I believe you.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.934
The government knows. I mean,
they could hook me up with a job

10:13.029 --> 10:14.109
right here in D. C.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.813
I mean, I should be working
with the Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.

10:16.950 --> 10:21.114
Come on, they paid for your college.
The President gave you a hero medal.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.287
Thank you, man. Great job.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.999
That's the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.293
All right, guys.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.122
- What the fuck!
- Wow.

10:33.216 --> 10:36.708
And, as I recall, that wasn't even
the highlight of your day.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.507
Mr. Ambassador, here.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.754
British Embassy, you're up next.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.766
No, you don't wear it.
See, you've gotta... The box.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.973
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.682
You're supposed to leave it
in the box, right?

10:52.777 --> 10:54.984
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.616
Oh, yeah. My medal.
You know who gave that to me?

11:06.291 --> 11:08.247
- Who?
- POUTS.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.496
President of the United States.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.211
Babe, it's hard for everybody
to get a job.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.418
I don't have time. You see, my parents
are gonna be here in a week

11:19.512 --> 11:21.594
on their road trip Partybus World Tour.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.842
If my dad gets here
and I don't have a job,

11:24.267 --> 11:26.599
he's gonna spank me.
You know, it's go time for me.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.802
All right, tonight, I'll give you a job.

11:29.480 --> 11:34.019
Romance me with a nice dinner
and maybe you can get that bonus.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.404
- Get lucky.
- Get him out of here.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.615
Wait. No, no, no, no.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.989
- Oh, he's gross!
- She's good.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.866
They're stranded here. Somebody's
got to watch out for them.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.289
Yesterday, that one was
in my underwear drawer.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.451
Did research. Looking real good, too.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.081
No need to hit me.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.164
- You are not a normal boyfriend.
- That's what you love about me.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.374
- Crybaby.
- We're not at the love word yet.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.381
Maybe a little bit closer when you're
covering your half of the rent.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.296
Good-bye.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.299
Frickin' shorting my circuits out here!

12:07.393 --> 12:10.851
It's inhumane, what it is!
Make us live in a box

12:10.939 --> 12:14.227
on a balcony, right next to a beast!
Like a common animal!

12:14.317 --> 12:15.397
Stop, okay?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.897
You and your creepy sidekick
can't be in here without permission.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.852
According to who?
Miss Blondie Blonde?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.813
Giddyup, little doggie!

12:24.244 --> 12:27.111
- Yo, Brains, wassup?
- Doing good.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.868
Shit, I seen this one.
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.826
You know, Sam, I don't know
about moving in with this chick.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.785
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

12:36.339 --> 12:37.920
She was mean. Didn't like her.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.543
Us guys got to stick together.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.174
We are family

12:44.305 --> 12:47.092
No, we are not family.
You're a political refugee,

12:47.183 --> 12:49.469
and I have finally found someone
who appreciates me for me.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.555
Well, you tell her
that we're not your pets,

12:51.646 --> 12:52.931
and we're not your toys!

12:53.022 --> 12:56.139
All right? We're an advanced, genius
alien race just looking for a home.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.065
- Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
- Didn't have to stop.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.736
Come on.
What're they going to do, tow it?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.359
Where is he?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.365
Sammy!

13:08.538 --> 13:10.369
- Come on, that's funny!
- Sam.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.618
I missed you guys so much.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.540
Sure, you did. What do you think?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.867
- Look at that.
- Cute.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.418
- You look old.
- Stop it.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.585
Feel like I can see the end.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.755
I love your little tie.
Hey, where's my girl?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.457
- Where's my beautiful Carly?
- She's at work, Ma.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.793
She's got a new job. You guys said
you were gonna be here in a week.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.218
The 21st, not the 11th, Dad, remember?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.637
We just hauled ass in this thing.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.557
- We stopped for gas.
- This thing. The love tub, it flies.

13:31.102 --> 13:34.560
Are we keeping you from something?
Like, say, your job?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.979
Well, it's about time.
You had us worried.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.229
I have job interviews.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.445
That's good.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.988
- That sucks.
- Stop it.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.986
You don't have to be so negative, Dad.
You know, you're in D. C.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.317
You're here with your son
and your family.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.368
- I mean, it's a good time.
- It sucks that you don't have a job.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.162
Yeah, but there's good things
to do here, too, right?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.989
Right? Museums
and monuments, okay?

13:55.084 --> 13:56.620
- I'll see you tonight.
- I'm bagging the gift.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.502
Sam, I think for an interview
you should wear real pants.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.830
I think for life,
you should wear real pants.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.290
What happened to Bumblebee?

14:04.385 --> 14:06.501
He's off on his missions.
I had to get this for backup.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.303
- Your car has a job, huh?
- Stop.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.176
What does it change into?

14:11.267 --> 14:13.303
It doesn't change into anything.
It's a collector's item, Ma.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.350
I got it for a steal.
It just needs some work. Trust me.

14:15.438 --> 14:18.145
No, I think it's darling.
It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee,

14:18.649 --> 14:21.265
if Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.279
Come on, we'll give you a ride!

14:27.241 --> 14:31.029
In the years since our arrival,
our new home, Earth,

14:31.120 --> 14:33.236
has seen much change.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.410
Energon detectors guard its cities now.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.209
Long-range defense systems
watch the skies.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.500
So now we assist our allies
in solving human conflicts,

14:47.303 --> 14:50.966
to prevent mankind
from bringing harm to itself.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.692
On the ground, per favore!
And stay there!

15:28.428 --> 15:32.171
We work in secret teams
on various missions around the globe.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.714
And all the while

15:34.809 --> 15:38.802
we search for signs
of our true enemies' return.

15:41.482 --> 15:45.646
I am Voshkod, General Counsel
with Ukrainian Department of Energy.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.601
My government will officially deny

15:47.697 --> 15:49.688
that we're having this conversation.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.240
At one of our decommissioned facilities,
a discovery was made,

15:53.327 --> 15:56.785
which I fear may be alien in nature.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.617
The facility's name is Chernobyl.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.387
Mr. Voshkod.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.310
So, uninhabited since '86.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.897
I hear it won't be livable again
for another 20,000 years?

16:29.155 --> 16:32.318
At least.
Ukraine was the most fertile land.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.693
It's a tragedy.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.198
This way.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.702
Gear up!
We have 60 minutes on the ground.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.825
Watch your radiation levels.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.457
Mr. Voshkod,
where's your protective gear?

16:52.053 --> 16:54.339
Where's your protective gear?

16:54.430 --> 16:55.510
It would not matter.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.343
For me, it's only a matter of time.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.719
Through the school.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.686
Yuri will take you below.
And one other thing, Colonel.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.685
In private,
there were some energy experiments.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.065
It can wait.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.665
Keep moving. Stay tight.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.873
Okay, right here. I think I found it.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.126
Optimus, we got a visual.

17:37.139 --> 17:41.132
Looks like the object's clamped
in some kind of a metal harness.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.219
What's this? Guys!

17:45.523 --> 17:47.855
Why does this thing have
Soviet space program markings on it?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.395
Sputnik?

17:50.486 --> 17:53.102
Energon readings, sir. It's strong.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.653
Below us. It's coming fast.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.448
Contact, contact!

18:18.889 --> 18:21.505
Get topside now! Move, move, move!

18:48.294 --> 18:51.331
- Let's go!
- Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!

18:51.547 --> 18:53.162
Stay behind me!

18:55.468 --> 18:56.674
Optimus!

19:02.391 --> 19:03.380
Fall back!

19:04.393 --> 19:05.883
It's circling around us!

19:06.395 --> 19:07.726
It's taking our flank!

19:14.070 --> 19:15.150
Get the heavy weapon!

19:18.074 --> 19:19.314
Optimus!

19:34.840 --> 19:37.047
What the hell was that thing?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.425
That

19:39.804 --> 19:41.544
is Shockwave.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.930
Why was he after this?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.342
It's impossible.

19:48.229 --> 19:53.098
This is an engine part
from a long lost Autobot ship.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.749
Pleasure working with you.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.549
Interviews. This is so exciting.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.464
Honey, do you want some gum?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.301
Your breath gets really gnarly
when you're nervous.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.103
- Mr. Witwicky?
- Yeah. Search is over.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.980
I'm Mr. Whitley.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.020
Mr...

20:37.403 --> 20:39.610
- Is anybody else joining?
- No.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.021
No? You want me to move right there?

20:42.116 --> 20:43.151
- I'll move right there.
- I'd prefer not.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.196
Ready? Begin.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.699
Graduated this year. Majored
in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.199
Very interested in government
and technology,

20:50.291 --> 20:51.622
how that's gonna intersect and co-exist.

20:51.709 --> 20:52.915
Shape the future.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.914
Why did we bother sending him
to an lvy college for?

20:56.005 --> 20:58.246
Three months out of school
and he can't find a job?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.830
Mr. Masuhisu...

20:59.925 --> 21:01.085
Matsumoto.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.713
- Matsumoto.
- Moto.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.589
- Martha, can I call you Martha?
- No, you may not.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.591
Okay, Jack,
there's two types of people in this world.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.014
There's think ers, there's doers.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.269
There's winners, there's dreamers,
and there's buddies.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.346
What about some weaknesses?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.223
I don't...

21:17.318 --> 21:18.524
You have a very trustworthy face.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.023
You remind me of
like an Asian Colonel Sanders.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.603
A man I can trust.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.653
He's a millennial.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.232
That means they're the, you know,
like lost generation.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.158
Why was the FBI looking for you?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.156
The what?

21:30.247 --> 21:31.612
Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.790
It was during all that alien craziness
when you were 14.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.708
I mean, they were very kind to me,
found me in a jiffy.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.962
And that's all been expunged.
Obama gave me a medal, actually.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.540
I'm just saying.
It's always good to have a medal guy

21:42.635 --> 21:44.000
in the office, with a medal.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.713
- From Obama?
- Yeah.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.593
In this office,
we're mostly Republicans, so...

21:50.100 --> 21:51.135
I'm not feeling too good.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.216
- No?
- No.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.302
Why don't you get a little dipping tray
and dip the dog in Pepto?

21:54.396 --> 21:55.556
That's a solution.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.058
I got another one. We got to go.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.264
- Come on.
- Really?

21:59.735 --> 22:00.770
Sit.

22:01.278 --> 22:05.191
Got myself a Mr. Sam Witwicky,
recent college graduate.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.773
Previous experience, next to zero,

22:07.910 --> 22:11.778
yet he has a recommend letter
from our board?

22:12.456 --> 22:14.071
WTF to that.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.623
- Do I know somebody on your board?
- Here's the deal.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.621
You know who we are.
Accuretta Systems,

22:18.712 --> 22:23.172
global leader in telecom, aerospace,
17 billion in profit last year.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.592
We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL,
you name it.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.421
You perform here,
doors open for you anywhere.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.177
First job out of college is critical, kid.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.055
You either take a step
down the correct career path

22:35.145 --> 22:38.603
or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.

22:39.108 --> 22:43.226
So it all depends on how you respond
to my next two words.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.102
Impress me.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.029
- Now?
- Impress me.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.232
You catch me off guard.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.611
- I don't know where to begin.
- Impress me.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.988
I'm an open book.
Ask me any question you like.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.035
- So you're a go-getter, ramrod...
- Yes, sir.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.238
...take-charge kind of guy?

22:55.332 --> 22:58.039
I'm a killer. A stone-cold killer.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.242
So, take-charge guy?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.873
Tak e-charge, Viking, barbarian,
of course, that's me.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.454
Pow! I'm here.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.386
We are not looking for that here.

23:11.765 --> 23:16.134
No brown-nosing. No suck up.
No toolery. I...

23:19.523 --> 23:21.059
Yes, Mr. Brazos.

23:21.150 --> 23:26.065
Why is Shontel using
what appears to be a red cup

23:26.155 --> 23:27.520
from the red floor

23:27.615 --> 23:30.072
- when we are on the yellow floor?
- I'm on it.

23:30.159 --> 23:34.823
It is a visual and, therefore,
a visceral betrayal.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.616
Stop it!

23:37.499 --> 23:38.739
Such a dumbass.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.874
Disgusting!

23:41.545 --> 23:43.285
Thank you!

23:43.380 --> 23:45.666
It's total anarchy around here.

23:47.051 --> 23:51.465
The e-mail I read
said administrative aide?

23:51.722 --> 23:53.258
Nope. Mailroom.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.257
I'm gonna go.

23:57.061 --> 24:00.929
Do you have any idea how many
lvy League Phi Beta Kappas

24:01.023 --> 24:04.231
- would kill to...
- Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay?

24:04.318 --> 24:06.730
I can't tell you how or when or why,

24:06.820 --> 24:08.105
but I have done shit that matters

24:08.197 --> 24:11.564
and I'd just kind of like a job
where I matter again.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.903
So thank you, but no, thank you, okay?

24:14.036 --> 24:17.199
You know what I think?
You want the job after this job.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.372
But, son, this is the job
that's standing in your way.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.789
And that's why you're gonna be
so very, very good at it.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.370
'Cause when I look at you,
I see a younger me.

24:45.693 --> 24:50.278
All arriving Autobots, in par,
training and debriefing in 15 minutes.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.736
Dino, report to Bay 23.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.237
Sideswipe, Bay 37
for weapons assessment.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.748
Senator, I suggest you remember that

25:03.836 --> 25:06.168
when the NSA wants funding,
they call me.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.746
When the CIA
is gonna take out a target,

25:08.841 --> 25:10.581
they ask first for my permission.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.882
And when the President wants to know

25:11.969 --> 25:14.085
which members of Congress
are politically vulnerable

25:14.179 --> 25:18.013
in terms of, let's say,
undiscovered criminal conduct,

25:18.100 --> 25:19.340
I'm the number he dials.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.926
U. S. Agencies say
they have been monitoring the blast.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.683
But if, in fact,
this was a covert military strike,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.106
- no nation has claimed responsibility.
- CIA is up my ass

25:27.192 --> 25:28.682
about this mystery raid
in the Middle East.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.019
So, it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?

25:32.114 --> 25:33.229
I'm not sure, ma'am.

25:33.323 --> 25:37.407
All right, guys. This is how you do
a Decepticon head kill shot.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.319
As Director of National Intelligence,

25:40.414 --> 25:42.279
I'm a really big fan
of intelligent answers.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.866
I can't really tell you definitively.
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.701
They like to sneak out of the house
every once in a while.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.002
Colonel Lennox, are you in command
or are you not?

25:49.089 --> 25:50.420
Yes, ma'am, I am.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.463
Stop with the "ma'am."
Enough with the "ma'am."

25:52.551 --> 25:53.916
Do I look like a "ma'am"?

25:54.011 --> 25:56.093
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.963
This gun
is my perfect invention, Ironhide.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.047
Right.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.848
Good, you're here!

26:01.977 --> 26:03.057
Me name's Que.

26:03.145 --> 26:05.932
I do hope you have answers for him.
I've never seen him so upset.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.355
Optimus, you remember
Charlotte Mearing?

26:08.442 --> 26:10.603
Our Director of National Intelligence?

26:10.694 --> 26:14.312
He's in a bad mood.
He's not talking to anybody today.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.898
What is this, the silent treatment?

26:17.993 --> 26:20.655
- We've seen that and this is not that.
- Definitely not.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.452
This is worse.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.996
Prime! Make something of yourself!

26:26.126 --> 26:27.332
He's pissed.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.881
You lied to us.

26:34.968 --> 26:39.132
Everything humans know of our planet
we were told had all been shared.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.965
So why was this found
in human possession?

26:42.184 --> 26:44.300
We were in the dark on this also.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.386
It was Director Only clearance
at Sector 7 until now.

26:47.481 --> 26:48.561
The bag.

26:48.857 --> 26:52.395
- Which bag?
- Hermès. Birkin. Green ostrich!

26:53.362 --> 26:54.852
Oh, my God.

26:56.198 --> 27:00.407
This is a secret few men knew,
and fewer still remain alive.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.984
Allow me to please introduce to you

27:02.079 --> 27:04.661
two of NASA's
founding mission directors

27:04.748 --> 27:06.955
and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin,

27:07.042 --> 27:09.454
one of the first two men
to step foot on the moon.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.287
Sir? Optimus Prime.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.875
From a fellow space traveler,
it's a true honor.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.380
The honor is mine.

27:19.805 --> 27:24.390
Our entire space race of the 1960s,
it appears, was in response to an event.

27:26.395 --> 27:30.229
Our astronauts investigated
a crashed alien ship.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.847
No survivors onboard.

27:32.025 --> 27:35.108
We were sworn to secrecy
by our Commander in Chief.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.945
This was a mission
you will never speak of.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.112
I understand, sir.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.409
A total of 35 people
knew the real plan at NASA.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.454
Soviets managed to land
unmanned probes.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.825
Somehow they must have picked up
that fuel rod.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.289
We believe the Russians deduced

27:53.380 --> 27:55.416
that the rod
was a fissionable fuel assembly,

27:55.507 --> 27:58.590
believed they had it mastered,
and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.009
We landed six missions in all.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.712
We took hundreds of photos
and samples.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.593
We locked them away forever,

28:05.726 --> 28:07.512
and the moon program was shut down.

28:07.603 --> 28:09.844
Well, did you search the crash vault?

28:12.733 --> 28:15.520
The ship's name was the Ark.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.523
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

28:18.906 --> 28:23.240
It was carrying an Autobot technology
which would have won us the war.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.318
And its captain.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.236
Who was its captain?

28:27.331 --> 28:31.244
The great Sentinel Prime,
the technology's inventor.

28:31.335 --> 28:35.078
He was commander of the Autobots
before me.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.787
It's imperative that I find it

28:37.007 --> 28:39.794
before the Decepticons learn
of its location.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.798
Our Autobot spacecraft
has the ability to get there.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.472
And you must pray it's in time.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.105
Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.827
Carly!

29:13.877 --> 29:15.913
- You got the job?
- This is crazy.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.164
- You really got it?
- Yes.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.497
See, what did I tell you? It's the bunny.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.790
You are so welcome.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.001
- Do you like me more?
- A little bit, yeah.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.211
You said you were his assistant curator,

29:25.305 --> 29:26.761
you didn't say
the guy owns Space Mountain.

29:26.848 --> 29:31.091
I know. Isn't it beautiful in here?
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.301
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.476
Sam.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.764
Dylan Gould.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.188
Hey. A pleasure to meet you.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.271
Pleasure meeting you.
Carly's told me a lot about you.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.697
Well, vice versa.
It's a beautiful building you got.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.320
It's like the Starship Enterprise in here.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.947
Thank you very much. It leaks.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.902
Before Carly came
to help run the collection,

29:50.998 --> 29:52.704
it was just a complete mess.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.032
But now,
the restorations are back on track.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.162
We're going to Pebble Beach this year,

29:56.253 --> 29:58.289
and we're gonna get a trophy
for that stand right there.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.213
You know why?
Because this woman right here

30:01.591 --> 30:03.627
- is my secret weapon.
- Okay.

30:03.719 --> 30:07.132
Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate.
All I've done is get you organized.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.759
You've done much more than that,
my Duchess.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.387
Nicknames, that's fun.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.468
Yeah. The Duchess.

30:14.563 --> 30:15.643
She's adorable.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.020
You know, when I stole her away
from the British Embassy,

30:18.108 --> 30:19.689
I said, "It's easy to manage a country.

30:19.776 --> 30:22.142
"Try managing
a priceless collection of art."

30:22.237 --> 30:26.947
Tak e a look
at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.114
Designed by a Frenchman.

30:28.744 --> 30:32.407
Look at the curves.
Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.038
Sensual.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.374
Built to evoke the body
of the ideal woman.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.076
Come on.

30:40.589 --> 30:44.707
My dad had a $10 desk and a dream,
and he built it into an empire.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.424
Wow.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.752
We're the largest accounting firm
in the U.S.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.840
I started up the venture side
after he passed. Invest in the future.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.175
Try and bet on the winners.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.012
See, collecting cars helps me
keep my sanity.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.478
You guys look great.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.899
That was a great day, Mr. Gould.

31:10.994 --> 31:13.030
- I haven't seen that one.
- No. Me, neither.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.736
Jeans are tight.

31:15.749 --> 31:19.162
Here we go. Here we go. You see that?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.742
Judgment. Judging a man by his car?

31:20.837 --> 31:22.418
And you're gonna wave at him
while he's judging me?

31:22.506 --> 31:25.714
What's with you? He's my boss.
This job pays for our food, our rent.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.417
No, I totally understand.
I'm totally fine. I get it. I'm well fed.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.218
And guess what?
I'm not your boy toy anymore.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.011
I got my big boy pants on.
You see them?

31:32.099 --> 31:33.305
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.099
Oh, my God.
Are you threatened by him?

31:40.565 --> 31:43.602
Threatened? What am I threatened by?
His money? His power? His good looks?

31:43.693 --> 31:45.058
None of the above. Check!

31:45.153 --> 31:47.189
God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.396
Get in the car, please.

31:49.491 --> 31:52.483
Sam, he's hardly the first man
to ever smile at me.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.862
- I think I can handle it.
- Hold on, hold on.

31:53.954 --> 31:57.196
It's the smiling back part
that gets me. Okay?

31:57.290 --> 31:58.996
No more smiles. Never again. I promise.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.828
That works for me.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.918
Easy! Easy!
You're not gonna get it started that way.

32:11.012 --> 32:14.049
Well, I was just getting it ready.
I'm about 32 % done with my restoration.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.223
Some chrome work,
put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.634
You know, Carly's been telling me
you've been struggling job-wise.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.267
Just so you know,

32:20.355 --> 32:23.688
I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems,
and I put in a call for you.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.858
Let's keep it between us, okay?
She's so proud of you.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.319
You're a lucky man.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.651
Xanthium approaching Tranquility Base.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.453
You're a go for landing.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.166
Ratchet, let's roll.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.685
We're entering the Ark.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.002
His levels are faint.

33:33.929 --> 33:37.763
He locked himself away
to guard the pillars.

33:38.225 --> 33:39.635
Sentinel.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.260
You're coming home, old friend.

34:23.353 --> 34:27.516
All hail Megatron.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.565
My master! Yes, my master! Yes!

34:41.955 --> 34:46.824
Don't be greedy, my fragile ones.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.127
My poor master.

34:52.215 --> 34:56.208
How it pains me to see you so wounded,
so weak.

34:56.303 --> 34:59.591
Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!

34:59.681 --> 35:02.639
You know what you are told,
which is nothing.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.100
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

35:13.194 --> 35:17.107
And what news
from your little assassin?

35:17.198 --> 35:19.405
Autobots have taken the bait!

35:19.492 --> 35:23.076
They've discovered the Ark
and returned with its cargo.

35:23.663 --> 35:28.032
You did me great honor
tracking that ship to the moon.

35:29.002 --> 35:33.587
Your human collaborators
have served their purpose, Soundwave.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.837
It's time to eliminate loose ends.

35:38.928 --> 35:42.011
Laserbeak, kill them all.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.634
With pleasure.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.312
Is your daddy home?

35:59.199 --> 36:01.360
- "Then Madeline said..."
- Madeline!

36:02.327 --> 36:04.113
Hello, Mom.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.202
Get out of the house!

36:10.293 --> 36:13.126
- What are you doing in my house?
- Just visiting.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.679
What is this hoochie-mama outfit?

36:34.442 --> 36:37.684
No, this is the aerospace division!
We do not allow that here!

36:37.779 --> 36:39.861
New guy! You see that?
That's a Latin meltdown, okay?

36:39.948 --> 36:42.314
You ever show up in my office
with a hoochie-mama outfit, you're fired.

36:42.409 --> 36:43.444
You got that?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.696
Okay, you're gonna be on this cart
for two-and-a-half years, okay?

36:45.787 --> 36:47.072
I want you to live it, love it and name it.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.163
There's no ladder climbing in my office.
I run a tight ship. Okay?

36:50.250 --> 36:51.581
- Yes, sir.
- Move!

37:10.520 --> 37:13.557
I found that paper
I was telling you about.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.354
- What are we looking at?
- Shut up!

37:19.112 --> 37:20.977
You do that to me again,
and I'll kick your ass!

37:23.491 --> 37:24.947
Hi.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.149
Hi, angel.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.609
- How are you?
- Good.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.570
I had a meeting downtown.
Was it okay for me to stop by?

37:30.665 --> 37:32.701
I don't know.
My 500-page employee conduct manual

37:32.792 --> 37:33.907
isn't exactly a page turner.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.037
This is great.

37:35.128 --> 37:37.835
Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world,
and I have organized four binders.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.332
I'm living the dream. Come on.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.795
Visitor violation.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.130
- You okay?
- Absolutely.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.138
I'm next.

37:55.023 --> 37:58.356
Listen. Saturday.
Dylan's throwing a party at his house.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.024
It's a work thing,
but he's invited you, too.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.100
Did he?

38:01.196 --> 38:02.561
I want you to come
and laugh at my bad jokes.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.145
It would really mean a lot to me, okay?

38:04.240 --> 38:06.026
I'd love to go. How'd you get over here?

38:07.035 --> 38:08.946
- Car.
- You don't have a car.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.157
- Yes, I do.
- What, did you win it in a raffle?

38:12.248 --> 38:13.613
He gave me one.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.788
He gave you a car?

38:14.876 --> 38:16.457
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.659
A work perk.

38:17.754 --> 38:22.293
- What kind of car did he give you?
- A Mercedes SLS AMG.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.632
Really throaty engine.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.760
Mercedes-Benz SLS

38:27.889 --> 38:30.346
- combines breathtaking performance. ...
- You drove this here?

38:31.601 --> 38:32.932
That's a $200, 000 car.

38:33.937 --> 38:34.972
I know.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.894
You know how long it would take me
to afford a car like this?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.977
- A long time?
- Yeah, like 53 years.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.353
He said it was for both of us.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.480
Then what we should do is,
we should sell it and buy a house.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.397
You're frustrated, I know.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.740
I've been there.

38:48.827 --> 38:52.365
It's called paying your dues.
Good things will happen.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.740
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:53.832 --> 38:56.323
I need some lunch time filing done, stat.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.534
Who would like
to score some Bruce Brazos points?

38:59.629 --> 39:01.665
Bruce, you found your guy.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.751
Witwicky!

39:05.176 --> 39:07.588
The man who makes this company run.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.886
Now, who have we here?

39:09.973 --> 39:12.806
Is it a sister, Facebook friend,
Twitter tweeter?

39:12.892 --> 39:15.099
- Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.
- Hi.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.518
I'm his girlfriend.
A pleasure to meet you. Sam was right.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.311
You really do have
a smashing head of hair.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.764
Well, thank you.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.353
- Sam, I got to run.
- Yeah.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.231
Here, your present.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.692
Your favorite color.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.283
- N ice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.
- And you.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.203
See you, boys.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.379
I'm still stewing about
that binder incident, Jerry.

39:44.465 --> 39:47.582
May I finish my Shuhua milk, Donny?

39:47.677 --> 39:50.919
I don't care about your exotic milk.
I care about respect!

40:10.450 --> 40:11.815
I know who you are!

40:11.910 --> 40:13.491
Witwicky! Witwicky!

40:14.996 --> 40:17.032
- I'm talking to you!
- Excuse me. Thank you.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.122
Slow down, tiger.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.040
You showed up in the background
of six different photos,

40:22.128 --> 40:23.743
two continents, with aliens.

40:23.838 --> 40:28.207
That was you in Egypt, right?
Because you know the aliens.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.882
See you!

40:31.596 --> 40:33.177
Give me my jacket!

40:40.563 --> 40:44.181
I'm Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.724
You're not getting it. Deep Throat.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.025
Watergate? I'm talking code to you...

40:48.488 --> 40:49.603
Damn it.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.480
They watch and listen.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.367
I can't go to the government,
but you can!

40:56.621 --> 40:59.784
Because shit's going down, son!
It is Code Pink, as in Floyd!

40:59.874 --> 41:02.536
Dark Side! Why do you think
no one's been up there since 1972?

41:02.877 --> 41:06.085
I know you're speaking English,
it's just a very strange English.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.333
That's why I'm not...

41:08.424 --> 41:10.085
Don't. I'm gonna hit you.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.841
I'm gonna hit you right back, son.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.801
It's my manifesto.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.132
They're whacking us out,

41:15.223 --> 41:16.804
everyone who knows
what's on the dark...

41:18.059 --> 41:20.596
Your alien friends are in danger,
you know, the good ones. It's up to you.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.014
Calm down.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.726
Easy, Sam!

41:34.909 --> 41:36.865
What are you looking at?

41:36.953 --> 41:38.363
Yo, dawg.

41:38.454 --> 41:41.742
Are you up in my shit?
Who are you working for?

41:43.418 --> 41:45.329
Staredown, you and me.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.411
Guess I won.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.999
Moon satellites.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.252
The Russian space program.

41:57.265 --> 41:58.471
Experts dead.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.263
Space program ends.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.142
Dark side... Dark side of the moon.

42:03.646 --> 42:06.103
Look what I found outside the bathroom.
Is it yours?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.226
- Deal with this.
- Yes, sir.

42:10.903 --> 42:12.564
I did everything you want!

42:12.697 --> 42:14.358
I really think we should talk,
'cause some of the stuff...

42:14.449 --> 42:16.189
Whoa! Knock first!

42:16.284 --> 42:17.569
Can't you see I'm busy?

42:17.702 --> 42:19.658
Who are you? Who are you?

42:20.580 --> 42:22.070
You straddled me in the stall.

42:22.498 --> 42:25.035
That's happened to me once in this life.
I wouldn't forget it.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.826
From the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.287
- You took your package out.
- Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay?

42:31.424 --> 42:33.710
One phone call from me
and I'll have you fired.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.632
Yes, I will, Gaylord!

42:36.137 --> 42:37.217
Are you okay?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.129
Hemorrhoids!

42:40.224 --> 42:41.964
Should I come back?
When should I come back?

42:42.060 --> 42:43.800
Come back
when you learn some manners!

42:47.815 --> 42:50.557
I don't know him!
I would never say anything!

42:54.238 --> 42:56.069
Okay, okay!
I sabotaged the mapping satellite,

42:56.157 --> 42:57.192
just like I promised,

42:57.283 --> 42:58.989
I can put a blind spot in the program
as a bonus.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.863
What more do you want from me?

43:00.953 --> 43:04.741
Jerry, you are my favorite.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.413
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

43:06.501 --> 43:10.460
I know, but my superiors need me to...

43:10.880 --> 43:13.747
- Please, you don't have to...
...suicide you.

43:15.009 --> 43:18.342
What did you say to Witwicky?

43:19.680 --> 43:21.045
Shit!

43:22.975 --> 43:24.931
Who wants some chick en dinner now,
bitch?

43:25.019 --> 43:28.182
'Cause somebody messed
with the wrong Wang today!

43:29.649 --> 43:31.731
Come on! You want some of me?

43:43.287 --> 43:46.700
I don't need any more didactic lectures
from Chuck.

43:46.791 --> 43:47.871
Jesus!

43:53.464 --> 43:54.874
Get legal.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.007
That's Jerry!

43:58.094 --> 44:00.380
Come on, people.
Yes, a workmate died,

44:00.471 --> 44:02.632
but looking out the window
is not going to bring him back.

44:02.723 --> 44:03.883
The man was depressed.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.010
Don't take a picture!

44:05.101 --> 44:07.342
You can keep watching him,
but he's not getting up.

44:07.436 --> 44:09.927
You all read "Humpty Dumpty." Okay?

44:10.731 --> 44:12.312
Witwicky.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.231
I'm spearheading the press.
You clean up.

44:14.694 --> 44:18.152
Wang is everywhere. He is in the bistro.

44:18.239 --> 44:20.571
He's in the bamboo.
He's on the balustrade.

44:20.783 --> 44:23.570
You see the sidewalk down there? Man!

44:24.036 --> 44:26.698
Box up his personals.
Get his name off his parking space.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.495
Hey, when did we get a new copier?

44:28.583 --> 44:30.699
Listen, I'm not gonna say anything
about what I saw.

44:30.793 --> 44:34.661
Who you share a toilet stall with
is totally your business.

44:34.755 --> 44:37.497
This is exceedingly Japanese.

44:39.802 --> 44:42.214
They never make it easy, do they?

45:19.884 --> 45:22.125
- What is with you?
- This is the real deal, Carly, okay?

45:22.220 --> 45:25.553
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.

45:29.185 --> 45:31.141
We've got an emergency.
You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.810
I'm reporting a Decepticon.
The Decepticons are back.

45:32.897 --> 45:33.977
You gotta open that gate right now.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.556
Easy, sir.
This is Health and Human Services.

45:36.651 --> 45:38.141
Right. Packing M4s?

45:38.236 --> 45:39.601
What are you protecting,
colostomy bags?

45:39.695 --> 45:40.980
- Bedpans? Throat lozenges?
- Babe...

45:41.322 --> 45:42.562
Where'd you get that hat from,
nursing school?

45:42.657 --> 45:44.363
So, you're nurses
and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.530
- Babe.
- Yes.

45:45.618 --> 45:46.698
I don't think we're in the right place.

45:46.786 --> 45:47.775
We are in the right place.

45:47.870 --> 45:49.906
We're in the right place
and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.

45:49.997 --> 45:50.952
- You're gonna get Optimus out here.
- Sir.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.029
Sir, you got the wrong building.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.113
I don't know what you're talking about.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.915
What part of "Decepticons are back"
do you not understand?

45:55.002 --> 45:57.584
Yo! You being a smartass?

45:57.672 --> 46:00.664
Do not hit my car! It's a collector's item!

46:00.925 --> 46:02.005
I wouldn't do that.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.333
You're crazy!

46:05.846 --> 46:06.961
We got an Energon reading!

46:07.056 --> 46:08.592
We've got aliens in the vehicle!

46:08.683 --> 46:11.846
You move, you're dead! Out! Out!

46:11.936 --> 46:13.801
Got aliens in the vehicle!

46:14.897 --> 46:17.263
- Freeze! Get out!
- We're freezing!

46:17.358 --> 46:18.939
Are you...

46:19.026 --> 46:20.357
Are you kidding me?

46:20.444 --> 46:22.025
Sam, they've got guns!

46:24.115 --> 46:27.198
- I got him. Go!
- Bee! Is Bee in there?

46:28.327 --> 46:29.942
Okay, all right!

46:30.037 --> 46:32.574
This how you treat Autobots?
We're on the same team.

46:32.665 --> 46:35.247
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven,
dickhead.

46:35.334 --> 46:37.165
- That's right.
- A-hole.

46:37.253 --> 46:38.993
How's your car now?

46:48.389 --> 46:49.424
That's my car.

46:50.474 --> 46:51.930
Come here.

46:52.018 --> 46:53.007
Come here!

46:53.102 --> 46:55.093
Come on. Sam.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.393
What is your deal?

46:56.939 --> 46:58.179
I know your black ops stuff
is important to you.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.560
I'm not trying to diminish it
or guilt-trip you or anything,

47:00.651 --> 47:02.141
I just never see you anymore.

47:02.236 --> 47:04.568
You can't come to the garage
and just hang out one night?

47:04.655 --> 47:06.771
Sam. That makes me feel bad.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.397
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.

47:08.492 --> 47:11.199
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.
I feel bad every single day.

47:11.287 --> 47:13.619
Yo, let's go, both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.071
What, we not good enough
for you anymore?

47:15.166 --> 47:18.533
I'm sorry, babe.
They were very rude, all right?

47:18.627 --> 47:21.585
And you're fixing my car.
You don't think so?

47:21.964 --> 47:23.920
Raise your hand if you had
a flying psycho-ninja copier

47:24.008 --> 47:24.997
trying to kill you today!

47:25.092 --> 47:26.172
Those are my brass knuckles.

47:26.510 --> 47:28.171
That's my anklet.
Do I have to take that off, too?

47:28.262 --> 47:29.297
And my toe rings?

47:29.597 --> 47:31.258
All NEST officials clear the floor.

47:31.349 --> 47:33.431
We have 10 minutes
until attempted contact.

47:33.934 --> 47:35.799
We've taken possession
of the five devices

47:35.895 --> 47:38.602
that were hidden in the ship
with Sentinel Prime.

47:38.689 --> 47:41.351
They're some kind of
prototype Autobot technology.

47:41.901 --> 47:44.859
They say Sentinel
was the Einstein of his civilization,

47:44.945 --> 47:46.151
so we're gonna keep these locked up

47:46.447 --> 47:48.108
until we know what we're dealing with.

47:48.199 --> 47:51.487
Right now, no one gets access. No one.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.694
This Wang guy recognized me.
He told me to warn you.

47:54.789 --> 47:55.995
He was talking
about the dark side of the moon,

47:56.082 --> 47:57.117
- then they killed him.
- Wait a minute.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.244
- He mentioned the moon?
- Yeah, dark side of the moon.

47:59.335 --> 48:01.917
But why would Decepticons
want to kill humans?

48:02.004 --> 48:04.040
I thought their war was
with the Autobots.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.292
And that is when he made his first
quick-look science report.

48:06.384 --> 48:08.045
That's what we want...

48:08.135 --> 48:09.295
Who's the chick? Okay.

48:09.387 --> 48:11.343
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

48:11.430 --> 48:13.842
Director Mearing,
this is Sam Witwicky...

48:13.933 --> 48:17.050
I know his name, Colonel.
I wanna know who gave him clearance?

48:17.144 --> 48:18.680
Who gave me clearance?
How about Optimus Prime,

48:18.771 --> 48:20.477
when he touched down in suburbia
looking for my house?

48:20.773 --> 48:22.889
This is the
National Intelligence Director.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.189
In case you...

48:24.860 --> 48:27.272
- H i.
- Disrespecting a federal officer?

48:27.363 --> 48:28.819
Maybe that'll get you somewhere.
Who's she?

48:28.906 --> 48:30.112
She's my girlfriend.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.776
What is this, like, a date?

48:32.326 --> 48:34.487
She knows all about the Autobots, okay?
She knows Bumblebee.

48:34.578 --> 48:37.035
And she comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.

48:37.123 --> 48:39.785
Hey, I have an idea. How about
we get back to the important topics,

48:39.875 --> 48:42.241
like the fact that I almost had
my face cut off by a Decepticon?

48:42.336 --> 48:44.918
As a taxpayer, I'd like to lodge
a complaint, as a matter of fact.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.085
Okay, listen, all right?

48:46.173 --> 48:48.209
One of the software engineers
at Sam's office was murdered today.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.040
He was involved in NASA's
lunar mapping probe.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.335
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

48:52.721 --> 48:55.463
We cannot entrust national security
to teenagers

48:55.850 --> 49:00.184
unless I missed a policy paper.
Are we doing that now? No. Good.

49:00.479 --> 49:01.935
I don't care who you are.

49:02.148 --> 49:05.811
If you breathe a word of what you
see in here, you will do time for treason.

49:05.901 --> 49:06.936
Do you understand me?

49:07.403 --> 49:10.395
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.
I know them. I don't know you.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.567
You will.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.033
Sentinel Prime.

49:16.495 --> 49:19.532
These things run on Energon,
and he's out of it. He's in a

49:19.790 --> 49:21.030
sort of a sleep mode.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.914
Let us begin.

49:31.427 --> 49:33.588
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.

49:34.889 --> 49:38.723
He holds the only thing in the universe
that can repower a Transformer's spark.

49:39.727 --> 49:41.388
This is incredible.

49:42.188 --> 49:43.724
Sentinel Prime,

49:45.107 --> 49:47.223
we bid you return.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.192
Hold your fire!

49:58.287 --> 49:59.993
Stop! Sentinel!

50:01.540 --> 50:03.952
It is I, Optimus Prime!

50:04.668 --> 50:06.909
It is all right. You are safe.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.079
There is nothing to fear.

50:11.217 --> 50:13.208
We are here.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.548
You are home, Sentinel.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.554
The war... The war!

50:24.104 --> 50:25.935
The war was lost.

50:26.190 --> 50:29.398
Cybertron is now
but a barren wasteland.

50:29.735 --> 50:32.647
We have taken refuge here,
on planet Earth.

50:32.988 --> 50:35.274
Its human race is our ally.

50:35.616 --> 50:38.358
My ship. We came under fire.

50:38.452 --> 50:41.694
The pillars. Where are the pillars?

50:42.373 --> 50:45.991
You saved five of them,
including the control pillar.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.370
Only five?

50:48.295 --> 50:49.876
We once had hundreds!

50:49.964 --> 50:51.170
Excuse me, gentlemen.

50:51.257 --> 50:54.044
May I ask, what is this technology
you're looking for?

50:54.134 --> 50:56.967
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

50:57.054 --> 50:59.670
Together the pillars
form a space bridge.

50:59.974 --> 51:03.512
I designed, and I alone, can control it.

51:03.602 --> 51:05.558
It defies your laws of physics

51:05.646 --> 51:08.262
to transport matter
through time and space.

51:08.357 --> 51:11.349
You're talking
about a teleportation device, aren't you?

51:11.443 --> 51:14.230
Yes, for resources, for refugees.

51:14.321 --> 51:18.234
Refugees, or troops of soldiers,
weapons, maybe bombs!

51:18.325 --> 51:21.158
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function, isn't it?

51:21.245 --> 51:25.409
It is our technology
and it must be returned.

51:25.499 --> 51:27.911
Yes. If humans say so.

51:28.002 --> 51:31.961
You can't just bring weapons of
mass destruction into our atmosphere!

51:32.047 --> 51:33.457
You kind of have to clear customs first!

51:33.549 --> 51:37.007
A little formality called paperwork
kind of separates us from the animals.

51:37.261 --> 51:40.594
I will overlook your condescending tone

51:40.681 --> 51:43.297
if you heed the gravity of mine.

51:43.392 --> 51:46.680
The Decepticons must never know
the space bridge is here.

51:46.812 --> 51:47.927
For in their hands,

51:48.397 --> 51:52.106
it would mean the end of your world.

51:53.402 --> 51:54.687
"Total Nightmare" file.

51:55.696 --> 51:58.608
So, the investigation is open.
We've sent agents to your office.

51:58.699 --> 52:01.315
And, for the time being, we're gonna
send you home with Autobot protection.

52:02.202 --> 52:03.567
Who do I need to speak to

52:03.662 --> 52:06.620
to get you guys to understand
that I can help, that I can contribute?

52:06.707 --> 52:07.947
Hey, we can all help.
Want to tell you what I know?

52:08.042 --> 52:10.704
I could tell you about the solar system,
all the fun planets to hang out in.

52:10.794 --> 52:11.783
Get off my desk, please.

52:11.879 --> 52:14.586
You pulling out guns?
I can't help you out now. She angry.

52:14.673 --> 52:15.753
Oh, my God.

52:16.091 --> 52:17.456
What do you envision for me?
I go home now?

52:17.551 --> 52:19.542
I go back to work? I make copies?
I mean...

52:19.637 --> 52:21.878
This is a unit
for veteran intelligence officers

52:21.972 --> 52:23.462
and Special Forces,

52:23.557 --> 52:25.718
not for boys
who once owned special cars.

52:25.809 --> 52:27.390
That's a bit harsh, isn't it, ma'am?

52:27.519 --> 52:29.009
Don't call me ma'am. I'm not a ma'am.

52:29.104 --> 52:30.594
Well, you're a woman, aren't you?

52:31.523 --> 52:33.935
So, are those yours?

52:34.526 --> 52:35.982
Yeah. CIA.

52:36.070 --> 52:39.107
I only ask 'cause I also have a medal,
from the President.

52:39.615 --> 52:42.482
Yeah. Great.
So, it's not that complicated, right?

52:42.576 --> 52:45.158
No one gets to work with the Autobots
unless I approve it.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.610
You're breaking my chain of command.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.661
Come on, let's go.
You've done what you came for.

52:51.752 --> 52:54.664
With all due respect, young man,
I appreciate what you did.

52:54.755 --> 52:55.915
But you're not a soldier.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.746
You're a messenger.
You've always been a messenger.

52:59.259 --> 53:00.624
He's a hero.

53:06.725 --> 53:09.182
Bee, you take the freight elevator.
I'll see you up there.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.603
This blows.
That lady officially kicked us out.

53:16.694 --> 53:19.436
Yeah.
Witness Protection Program sucks.

53:19.530 --> 53:22.613
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer
with big yellow and his cannons.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.531
That dog can't protect crap.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.155
Bee?

53:32.960 --> 53:34.791
You miss hanging out?

53:36.046 --> 53:37.126
Yeah, me, too.

53:42.177 --> 53:43.667
That woman,
she called me a messenger.

53:43.762 --> 53:46.378
Can you believe that? After everything
I've done, I'm a messenger.

53:46.473 --> 53:49.215
I believe it. I tell you, Sammy,
we feel the same way.

53:49.309 --> 53:51.015
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.229
We should do something about it.

53:55.315 --> 53:59.479
Bee, I need to know
why they're killing humans.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.561
I say we call in the expert.

54:01.655 --> 54:04.442
My next guest is a former
American intelligence operative

54:04.533 --> 54:06.398
who has dared to speak out

54:06.493 --> 54:10.202
regarding our alleged military alliance
with what many describe

54:10.289 --> 54:13.452
as a group
of extraterrestrial mercenaries.

54:13.542 --> 54:17.876
He is the author of the bestselling book,
Code-Name Hero.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.086
Former special agent,
Seymour Simmons.

54:20.174 --> 54:22.665
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.625
Now, Agent Simmons,
you would have us believe

54:24.720 --> 54:26.460
that it is in our best interest

54:26.555 --> 54:30.139
to formally take sides
in this so-called alien civil war?

54:30.225 --> 54:32.762
Well, the other side wanted to
spank us for breakfast,

54:32.853 --> 54:35.219
so I wouldn't exactly call it a toss-up.

54:35.314 --> 54:37.100
These Decepticons are lethal.

54:37.191 --> 54:39.933
But polls show
half the world would feel safer

54:40.027 --> 54:41.767
with the Autobots completely gone.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.569
Get them out of here!
We don't need them here!

54:44.656 --> 54:46.772
I feel safer when I sleep
with a hand grenade.

54:46.867 --> 54:48.232
Doesn't mean I'm always right.

54:48.327 --> 54:51.034
Now, agent, here at The Factor
we have obtained documents

54:51.121 --> 54:53.487
that show you were fired. ...

54:53.582 --> 54:55.743
- Chaz, I'm doing an interview.
- Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

54:55.834 --> 54:56.949
Downsized, Bill.

54:57.044 --> 54:58.659
- Budget cuts. Chaz, out.
- Your psych evaluation reports

54:58.754 --> 55:01.461
"severe delusional tendencies."

55:01.548 --> 55:02.708
This is ambush journalism.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.711
You want the truth
about the alien alliance?

55:04.802 --> 55:08.636
Buy my book! Buy my book,
before it's too late, people!

55:08.722 --> 55:09.962
You want a piece of me, Bill?

55:10.057 --> 55:11.422
- You want to get naked? I'm ready!
- Wow.

55:11.517 --> 55:14.384
- Interview is over! You, out of my house.
- You're sounding like a pinhead, agent.

55:14.478 --> 55:16.218
- And I've got a suggestion for you.
- It's over. Understand?

55:16.313 --> 55:17.519
- Damage control.
- Dutch!

55:17.606 --> 55:19.517
You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons!

55:19.608 --> 55:21.815
You have 23 seconds
to leave the property.

55:21.902 --> 55:23.312
I have called the police!

55:23.403 --> 55:25.894
You are peasant people
throwing rocks at a giant!

55:25.989 --> 55:27.229
What's up next? What have we got?

55:27.366 --> 55:28.651
Book signing, Midtown, noon.

55:28.742 --> 55:30.824
Then we pitch your reality show
to the Discovery Channel.

55:31.078 --> 55:34.115
And I have this Witwicky
who keeps calling me.

55:34.206 --> 55:35.241
Five times today.

55:35.332 --> 55:36.492
Kid? What does he want?

55:36.583 --> 55:38.039
I called you
because the Decepticons are back.

55:38.126 --> 55:39.491
I want to know why,
and I need your help.

55:39.586 --> 55:41.827
They're back?

55:41.922 --> 55:43.332
Well, that's good for business.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.334
What if I told you
I know a 50-year-old alien secret

55:45.425 --> 55:46.631
that nobody ever told you.

55:47.094 --> 55:52.088
Do not tempt my addiction.
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

55:52.224 --> 55:54.966
- Dutch, is this line secure?
- No.

55:57.479 --> 56:00.516
Don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?

56:00.607 --> 56:02.973
Do not relapse. I won't.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.018
Do not let the demons win.

56:06.113 --> 56:07.228
Got it.

56:08.574 --> 56:10.860
What kind of secret?

56:11.410 --> 56:14.117
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

56:14.204 --> 56:16.320
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.

56:16.790 --> 56:18.530
Apollo.

56:19.793 --> 56:20.953
Dutch!

56:27.676 --> 56:30.793
Tell Megatron, "Let's tango."

56:41.732 --> 56:44.849
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

56:45.402 --> 56:48.565
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

56:48.655 --> 56:51.362
I've wondered what might have been

56:51.450 --> 56:55.318
if you had fought the final battle,
instead of me.

56:55.954 --> 56:58.536
Never mourn the past, young warrior.

56:58.624 --> 57:02.617
Thanks to you, our race survives.

57:04.546 --> 57:07.083
You were our leader, Sentinel.

57:07.174 --> 57:10.007
It is your right to lead us again.

57:10.093 --> 57:12.379
In a world I do not know,

57:12.471 --> 57:17.431
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.
You are mine.

57:21.313 --> 57:23.645
You've got to break this case down.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.685
What we have here
is an astronaut epidemic.

57:25.776 --> 57:29.234
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident.
Killed. DOA. Car death.

57:29.321 --> 57:30.436
It's like these guys can't drive.

57:30.530 --> 57:32.566
They can fly into outer space,
but they can't drive a car.

57:33.325 --> 57:36.567
- Procured your information, Witwicky.
- Thank you, Bruce.

57:37.537 --> 57:38.868
Now,

57:40.874 --> 57:42.705
let me see one right now. One time.

57:43.210 --> 57:44.325
- Quick.
- Very.

57:50.384 --> 57:51.999
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.630
It says NASA launched it in 2009.

57:55.222 --> 57:57.304
See, forensics show
Wang may have messed with the code,

57:57.391 --> 57:58.972
preventing it from mapping
the far side of the moon,

57:59.059 --> 58:00.299
which is also the dark side.

58:00.394 --> 58:01.804
Fucking awesome.

58:01.895 --> 58:05.479
They infiltrate us, intimidate us,
coerce us to do their dirty work.

58:05.565 --> 58:07.430
And once they're done,

58:08.735 --> 58:10.271
a double-tap to the cerebellum.

58:10.737 --> 58:12.568
So humans are working
for the Decepticons.

58:13.198 --> 58:15.234
I don't think
this is about the Decepticons

58:15.325 --> 58:17.737
looking for something on the moon.

58:18.578 --> 58:22.036
I think it's about something
they wanted to hide.

58:22.666 --> 58:24.156
Come to Daddy.

58:25.293 --> 58:26.373
Come on, throw down.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.416
Did you eat a lot of paint chips
when you were a kid?

58:31.008 --> 58:32.043
He's a freak.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.382
- Like it?
- Get back!

58:37.556 --> 58:38.762
I'm ticklish!

58:40.058 --> 58:44.347
Sir! We are having a pretty high-level
alien intel confab here

58:44.438 --> 58:47.680
that I don't think you're cleared for,
errand boy.

58:47.774 --> 58:48.809
Yeah, you're right.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.312
- It's a bitching robot.
- I think it's time to go, Bruce.

58:51.403 --> 58:53.940
- Thank you so much for this. And...
- Got to go, Bruce.

58:56.116 --> 58:59.529
I'm smoking over here. Downloading
missing Russian cosmonauts.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.490
Turns out the Soviets canceled
a manned mission to the moon.

59:02.748 --> 59:04.454
The moon, in 1972.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.907
And two of their cosmonauts
went into hiding in America.

59:07.002 --> 59:08.708
And I just found them alive.

59:08.795 --> 59:10.001
You're a genius, Brains.

59:15.260 --> 59:17.342
That was smooth, Bumblebee.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.635
Missed it by that much.

59:25.687 --> 59:26.802
Hi.

59:27.397 --> 59:29.262
Would somebody care to tell me
what the hell's going on?

59:29.357 --> 59:31.439
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

59:31.526 --> 59:34.063
Who am I? Who is that?
Dutch! Frisk her!

59:34.529 --> 59:35.564
Certainly.

59:35.655 --> 59:37.737
No. Dutch.

59:37.824 --> 59:39.064
Don't touch me.

59:39.159 --> 59:40.695
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- Sam?

59:41.244 --> 59:42.575
Angel.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.946
I was working. I'm sorry about this.

59:46.041 --> 59:48.578
- Great. We're homeless.
- She lives here? Wow.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.872
You had your chance to frisk her.

59:50.962 --> 59:53.954
- I have a girlfriend.
- Really? What's her name?

59:54.049 --> 59:55.209
India.

59:56.676 --> 59:58.632
We're supposed to be
at Dylan's party, remember?

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.176
I do remember,
but these are my friends.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.719
They need me.
I have to be here right now.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:05.095
So, what, the Autobots and the military,
they can't handle this on their own?

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:07.426
You know what I liked
about your war stories, Sam?

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.603
It's that they were stories,
they were in the past.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.429
Look, I know you're thinking
about your brother, okay?

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:14.107
And you're thinking about your family.
And it's not that situation.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:15.183
- No?
- No.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:18.020
Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:21.073
You think we'd rather have his medals,
or we'd rather have him?

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.994
I hear you. I get it.
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.412
Just stop for a second.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:28.955
You think I could sleep last night?

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.328
And then it hit me.
No, Sam wants to be in danger.

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:34.001
- He doesn't know who he is without it.
- I just want to matter.

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:36.788
You matter to me.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.296
I know you're worried.
I know you're worried.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.473
But I promise you, I can handle this.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.808
Can you? You can promise it?

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.226
I promise.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:54.894
Sam, I don't want to lose you,
and I know where this leads.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.527
I'm not ready for this.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.655
Are you coming with me?

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.152
I can't.

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.659
Okay.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.499
Hey.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.289
Here's your foot.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.594
The warrior's path is a solitary one.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:35.729
How the hell did she afford that car?

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:38.183
- Her boss.
- Rich bastards!

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:40.735
I used to hate them. Now, it's...

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:45.858
Going to a gig on the hunt
for two Russian cosmonauts.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:48.068
Nothing like driving in a Maybach.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.119
Germans know how to make cars,
let me tell you.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:56.000
My Dutchman,
former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire,

01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:57.327
tracked them down here.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:01.672
So, these cosmonauts
went into hiding. Why?

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.125
Bingo. I got a match.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.052
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:09.381
The thing about Russians is,
they never like to talk.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:12.218
It's gonna take a little
of the "international language."

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:19.641
That means "good-bye."

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.077
Stay loose.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.993
Dutch, give me something tough.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:41.997
Baryshnikov.

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.377
We do speak English.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.167
Dutch, you suck.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.253
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:51.340
It's like all the buttons
you never push on a calculator!

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.720
I don't suck.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:56.929
Agent Seymour Simmons,
Sector Eight, formerly Seven.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.981
We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:01.103
So what?

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:04.152
You were supposed to travel
to the dark side of the moon,

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.946
then it all got shut down.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.739
The question is, why?

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.833
"Can my child smoke in here?"

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:27.842
Okay, all right. Okay.

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:30.132
Go ahead, shoot me.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.631
I'm willing to die for my country.
Are you?

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.135
Really?

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.887
You are beautiful. Has anyone ever
told you you're beautiful?

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.142
She's a beautiful woman.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.064
Hey!

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.236
Dutch! Back in the cage.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:54.368
Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.329
Control your boy, please.
Control your boy.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.576
Dutch, stop!

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.372
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.207
Okay, let's everybody just calm down!

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:10.760
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns.
Let's relax. World War II is over.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.263
You are about to see
one of the biggest Soviet secrets.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.187
America first to send man to the moon.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.936
But USSR first to send camera.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:27.815
In 1959, our Luna 3

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:31.148
take picture of the dark,
the shadow side.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.616
Sees nothing.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:38.280
But in 1963, Luna 4 sees...

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.491
- Strange rocks.
- Yeah.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.622
Around the ship. Hundreds of them.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.453
Yeah, show picture.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:49.211
With some drag marks.

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:55.297
I've seen these.
These aren't rocks, these are pillars.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:58.016
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

01:04:58.103 --> 01:05:00.344
We know about them
because the Autobots have five of these.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:04.556
The Decepticons must have raided
the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there,

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.063
took the pillars, and hid them.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:08.188
It doesn't make sense.

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.270
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:11.445
Why would they leave Sentinel

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:13.364
when he's the only one
who can use them?

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.241
Unless...

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.576
He's the one thing they still need.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.872
We've got to meet up with Sentinel,
rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.579
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel.
Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:24.785
We're coming to NEST now.

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:29.038
Mr. Witwicky,
I thought I made it clear to you

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.624
that I did not want you
calling this phone.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:33.425
Listen, the whole thing has been
a setup since the beginning.

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:35.629
The Decepticons wanted Optimus
to find Sentinel

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.429
because only Optimus could revive him.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.257
But we have the space bridge.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:42.594
Mearing, you have five pillars.
I just learned that they have hundreds.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:43.974
You're doing exactly
what they wanted you to do.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.271
What do you need me to say to you?

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.849
The Decepticons are coming
for Sentinel Prime!

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.107
We're going to NEST.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:55.402
We have an Energon alert.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.859
Energon readings detected
on the D. C. Parkway.

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:01.871
Currently tracking
three black Suburbans.

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:38.613
Bee, you got to get Sentinel
out of here! You got to guard him!

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:49.911
Oh, mein Gott! I'm fired!

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:55.671
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.269
Got you!

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:17.404
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:47.893
Bee, you've got to move faster!
Faster, Bee! Go!

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:52.728
Bee!

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:15.956
All right, back to NEST!

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:24.926
Dino, I got him!

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:34.975
Ironhide!

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:01.341
Is there a problem?

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.883
A little Mexican standoff we got here.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.805
Weapons down.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.934
And we'll let you escape
with your dignity.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:15.518
Drop them.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.813
That's good.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.528
Ironhide, watch out!

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:31.738
Ironhide, catch!

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:38.787
Behind you!

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.176
Decepticon punk!

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:53.928
Class dismissed.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.566
- Get inside! Let's go!
- Move! Keep moving!

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:04.860
- Lennox!
- Go, go, go!

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.066
We got Decepticons everywhere.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.242
I've got my whole team deployed
looking for them. Ironhide!

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.862
Protect Sentinel!
Get him locked up inside!

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:12.197
Consider it done!

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.577
Hey, you've got to guard him,
'cause he's the key to the whole thing.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:19.413
Indeed, I am. What you must realize,
my Autobot brothers,

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:22.123
is we were never going to win the war.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:27.091
For the sake of our planet's survival,
a deal had to be made

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.589
with Megatron.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:39.311
- Get back!
- What have you done?

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:43.694
I hereby discharge you from duty.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:50.947
- Bee!
- Get back!

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:08.753
Rally all NEST forces back to the base!
Come on!

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:09.837
No...

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:19.646
Get a medic down here!

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:23.226
We don't have enough men!
Do not engage Sentinel!

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.853
Just go to the back gate.

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:31.693
Tak e cover!

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:36.489
Watch left! Watch left!

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:46.699
Www.celebritysex.tk

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:50.090
- Director, don't go there!
- Stand down!

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:51.261
Hey, Sentinel!

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.051
- Director!
- What is going on?

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.427
What do you think you are doing?

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.721
I am a Prime!

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.182
I do not take orders from you.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:04.608
Director Mearing, come on.

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:06.481
We can't fight him. Let's go.
We have to go.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:10.030
Now return what belongs to me!

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:13.567
Oh, my God!

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:29.967
- You guys okay?
- Is everybody out?

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:32.340
Everybody, stay calm.
You're gonna be fine.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:45.100
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!
This is all on you!

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.185
Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:52.524
Come on, let's go.
All right, notify the 101St Airborne!

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.950
We need to hunt this thing down!

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:02.287
Carly!

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:07.288
Hot from our little campfire.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:09.419
S'mores. Isn't that great?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.341
We're really living off the land.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.212
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen
Carly come home yet?

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:16.464
Excuse me. Can you knock, please?
This is our bedroom.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:17.673
Why wouldn't she be at home?

01:13:17.852 --> 01:13:20.764
We had a fight
and we might have broken up,

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:21.935
or be on a break. I don't really know.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.230
- What? No.
- Look, I can't talk about it right now.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:26.558
I can't go into details, Mom.
I have to find her.

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.610
Sit down. We're having
a family meeting. Family meeting!

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.895
You may not know this,

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.402
but your father and I
were not always this perfectly happy.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:34.902
You know, there was a time
in our marriage

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.655
when I thought
this was not gonna work out.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:38.699
- Can we please not?
- She's damaging him.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.372
You break up with
one world-class hottie...

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:42.949
No. Stop. Stop, okay? She dumped me,

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:45.035
I moved on to something better.
That's it. I'm a happier person.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:46.118
The second beautiful girl,
and you lose her.

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:47.202
Why don't you help me?

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:49.622
- They had an argument.
- One fight.

01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:52.584
You're not gonna get a third one,
I mean, unless you have like a big...

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:53.918
What the... Ma!

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:56.425
Maybe you just don't know
what you're doing.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:58.597
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- You need the book.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.720
- Tell him about the book.
- You're always wrong. Get used to it.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.597
Okay. You've gotta read this.
She Comes First.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.724
- There's some killer shit in here.
- No. No.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:07.272
- That's it, I'm going.
- No! No!

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.938
Sit down, sit down! Back me up!

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:12.736
- Happy wife, happy life.
- Heck yeah.

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:16.281
Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery
for the rest of your...

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:17.609
- Stop.
- It's true.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:19.864
All I'm saying is, do you love this girl?

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.534
- She's the one.
- Then you gotta go get her.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.911
I mean, your dad and I,
when we had troubles,

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.664
he moved heaven and earth to find me.

01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:30.337
Say what you said. Say it.

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:33.040
"I will follow you to the end of time."

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:34.632
Does that suck or what?

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.631
- It's like a bad sci-fi film.
- No. It is so sweet.

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:40.093
I want you to get out of the city. You get
as far away from here as you can.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:41.423
You understand?

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:42.758
I love you.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:06.366
My master! Such a brilliant scheme!

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:10.624
So when Sentinel left Cybertron,
it was to defect?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.415
He was meant to rendezvous
with me here on Earth

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.751
before fate waylaid us both.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.636
The only way to revive him,

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:22.591
we needed Prime and his Matrix.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.759
Excellent strategy.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.811
Mine, mine!

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.775
So he is now your partner, master?

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:43.452
He is my greatest triumph.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:44.824
So impressive.

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:47.407
Commencing transport.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.330
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:51.877
Forgive me.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:57.841
Here we are.

01:15:57.928 --> 01:15:59.793
Fight us now.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:39.833
Contact!

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.965
Watch out! Move it! Move it!

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:47.345
Autobots, retreat!

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:16.041
Why, Sentinel, why?

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:19.169
For Cybertron! For our home!

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:24.800
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:29.975
No, it's not the only way. This is our
home! We must defend the humans!

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.428
So lost you are, Optimus.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.559
On Cybertron, we were gods.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.142
And here, they call us machines.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.946
Let the humans serve us, or perish.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:49.245
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
In time you'll see.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.407
It's not over.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:59.251
Now, if I were him, I wouldn't let you
out of my sight for one second.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.417
It's funny. I was just thinking
on the way over here,

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.548
I could really use some advice
from Dylan, and there he is.

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:07.175
- Can I speak to you, Carly?
- Welcome. Please, sit down.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.381
Have a drink.

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:11.725
You know what, I don't need a drink.
Or a car, or a job.

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:13.222
I just need to speak
to my girlfriend alone.

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:14.599
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:18.102
Excuse me.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.153
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you outside.

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:25.443
I really think I can help you, Sam.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.116
I remember a talk I had
with my dad once about tough choices.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.035
Yeah, now's not the time.
We'll set something up, though.

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.363
Of course, it was way back,
when my dad's firm was in charge

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:35.165
of budget review
and accounting for NASA.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:37.873
You see,
the thing that he taught me was,

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:41.126
when it's not your war,
you join the side that's going to win.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:44.082
Move.

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.634
Too direct? Or is it just me?

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:46.756
Certainly not you, sir.

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:01.851
You're mine!

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:03.648
No!

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.615
- Get help!
- Sam, I can't get out!

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.150
- Someone get help!
- Good night!

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.281
Good night, Mr. Dylan.

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:13.363
Get me out of here!

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.084
Help! Get help!

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.163
- He's young. He will learn. Good night.
- Get me out!

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:23.505
It was a fun night.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:28.298
You really think you're the first man ever
asked to join the noble alien cause?

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:29.720
Who are you?

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:32.890
Do you know why we've not been back
to the moon since 1972?

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.800
Because these two,

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:37.932
they came to my dad and they told him
to do some creative accounting.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.605
Make it way too expensive
to ever go back. So, he and the others

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:43.025
shut down the American
and Russian space programs.

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:45.103
And they've been our clients ever since.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.859
- You helped them kill people?
- You think they'd give you a choice?

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.653
Besides, it's not
like I personally participated.

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:51.779
I am a liaison. I liaise.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:56.705
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.535
Sam!

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:05.589
- Sam!
- Let her go!

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.837
Sam!

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:12.880
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.014
You're the one spy
I've never been able to provide

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.558
as someone close to the Autobots.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.226
Sam! Don't do what he wants!

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.933
Yes, he will.

01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:25.063
They all do.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.563
They will slaughter her,
you understand me?

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:33.196
In the time it takes you to blink,
they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me.

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:35.073
So you show a little respect

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.405
when someone offers you a job!

01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:40.036
Wrist.

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:42.292
You are to track down Optimus Prime,

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:44.244
because you're the one human
he trusts,

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.876
and you will ask one question.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:50.005
How does he intend to fight back?
Strategies, tactics, everything!

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:58.183
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it?
It's very high-tech.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.807
It lets us see what you see,
hear what you hear

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:02.229
and it taps your nervous system.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:04.682
So, if you so much as try and signal...

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:08.610
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.734
Relationships have consequences.
I am here because of my father.

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:13.235
She is here because of you.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:18.120
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:19.989
Soundwave, would you please?

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.211
Sam, do your job.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:29.123
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.461
I'll kill you. You have my word.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:40.472
Combatant Commands
are now at DEFCON 1.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.308
Approximately 200 Decepticons
are now in hiding.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:45.264
Energon detectors have been triggered

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:47.520
as far away
as South America and China.

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:50.645
The U. N. Just received
an encrypted audio file.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.481
They say it's from the leader
of the Autobots.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.156
Defenders of Earth.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:57.906
We have come
for your natural resources

01:21:57.996 --> 01:22:00.112
to rebuild our damaged planet.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.165
When we have transported all we need,

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:06.289
we will leave your world in peace.

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.291
For such peace to exist,

01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:13.126
you must immediately exile
the Autobot rebels you have harbored.

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:15.502
Nonnegotiable.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.504
Renounce the rebels.

01:22:18.058 --> 01:22:20.470
We await your reply.

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.767
We'll debrief you in transit.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.265
Yeah, I really don't see
how I can be of any help.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:25.436
I mean, you guys seem pretty busy.

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:27.355
We could just do this another time,
I think.

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.024
I have underestimated you at every turn.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.355
What?

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.281
You warned us
that they were using humans.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.029
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.326
Director!

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.038
Who am I? Hey, you're the expert.
I'm just a walking security risk.

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:50.416
Are you all right?

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:53.499
Yes.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.963
- No, you're not. You're sweating.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:57.169
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

01:22:57.264 --> 01:22:59.346
I'm nervous because you got me
in here with this information.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:00.718
Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie.
I blog everything.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.549
- I can't keep a secret to save my life.
- You wouldn't dare.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.386
- That's the truth. I'm telling you.
- Director, the Pentagon's calling in 15.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:08.722
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

01:23:10.277 --> 01:23:11.483
Get away from me.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.403
It's been a remarkable series of events
today at the Capitol.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.526
Just moments ago,
legislation was passed

01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:18.073
to exile the Autobots

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.491
from American shores.

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:22.866
The U. S. Military alliance with them
is officially over.

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:24.696
In the words
of the House Majority Leader,

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:26.531
the sponsor of today's resolution,

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:27.787
- "We cannot in good conscience...."
- Okay.

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:29.584
What? They can't do this.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.629
- You gotta tell them. They can't do that.
- Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:35.002
These are our allies. The Autobots
fought for us. They fought with us.

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:36.128
And where are we now?

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.756
Facing an enemy invasion

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.508
with an enemy that has the means
to deploy countless more.

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:45.517
If there is any more you know,

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:48.095
anything at all
about the enemy's intentions,

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:50.768
now is the time to tell.

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.941
Autobots have no way
of leaving this planet.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:55.936
And that is where you're wrong.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.981
Its name is the Xanthium.

01:23:59.618 --> 01:24:01.028
It brought the second wave of Autobots

01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:03.610
and it's been under NASA 's care
and study ever since.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.196
We linked it
with a decommissioned shuttle

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.953
to maintain military control
until they're gone.

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:13.162
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque
on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!

01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:15.623
You're gonna risk the lives
of all me mates! I'll ball you!

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:19.217
These guys are the Wreck ers.
They take care of the Xanthium.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.386
We don't let them off the base much,
'cause they're assholes.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:23.509
You gotta pull that, ya nancy swanker!

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.056
It's time to kill him!

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:27.054
I'm just trying to help, you know.
Just doing my job.

01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:29.602
Just calm down. Leave him alone.
This is a human being.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.772
- Epps!
- You are ridiculous!

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:33.098
- Is that you?
- What up, man?

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:34.979
What are you doing here?

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.651
I retired from the Air Force.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:38.486
Can you let my hand go?

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.031
What the hell was that?

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.408
Now I just consult
to run interference for them.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:44.735
Well, you're not helping!

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:48.118
No more combat and aliens shooting
at my ass. I got a dream job.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.119
Time to get off this planet.

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:53.577
Kicking the Autobots out.
Can you believe this is happening?

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:57.171
- Where do you think it's taking them?
- Any planet but here.

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.719
I wanna talk
to whoever's in charge here!

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:07.516
Well, well, well. Charlotte Mearing.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:10.265
Agent Simmons.
Former Agent Simmons.

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:12.596
So I see you survived Washington.

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:16.650
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:21.022
They're bringing everybody in, kid.
Putting all the intel on the table.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:26.406
And if you think deporting nine Autobots
is gonna solve a damn thing...

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:27.736
It's out of my hands.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.280
Moving up in the world?

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.372
Your booty looks excellent.

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.255
If you ever say a word to anyone

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:40.879
about what happened
that night in Quantico,

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:42.751
I'll cut your heart out.

01:25:43.513 --> 01:25:44.878
You already did.

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:48.636
Sammy, listen to me.
Don't let them exile us.

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:51.434
- Don't let them take us, Sam.
- It's a Decepticon trap.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:31.266
Check the nitrogen levels.
We're booking out of here.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:34.928
Optimus?

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:39.601
What your leaders say is true.
This was all my fault.

01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:44.317
I told them whom to trust.
I was so wrong.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.945
That doesn't make it your fault.
It just makes you human for a change.

01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:48.825
Remember this.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.779
You may lose your faith in us,

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:55.449
but never in yourselves.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.332
I need to know
how you're gonna fight back.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.670
I know this is strategy,
I know you're coming back

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:10.676
with reinforcements, something.
I know there's a plan.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.312
You can tell me.
No other human will ever know.

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.477
There is no plan.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:24.611
If we just do what they want,
how are we gonna live with ourselves?

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:28.652
You are my friend, Sam.

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:31.151
You always will be.

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:34.158
But your leaders have spoken.

01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:37.415
From here,

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.627
the fight will be your own.

01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:55.517
Make it short.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:57.727
We're loading up.

01:27:58.648 --> 01:28:02.357
All right, hustle up!
We're launching at dawn.

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:09.406
We're gonna do whatever we can.
Make it like it was.

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:12.735
You will always be my friend, Sam.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.161
I gotta be going on.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.753
Years from now, they're gonna ask us,

01:28:33.099 --> 01:28:35.215
"Where were you
when they took over the planet?"

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:38.844
We're gonna say,

01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:42.389
"We just stood by and watched."

01:28:56.373 --> 01:28:58.739
You should really look at this
as a partnership.

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:01.329
You have to stand
on the side of progress

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:02.875
if you wanna be a part of history.

01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:18.676
Seven, six, five,

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:21.596
four, three, two,

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:23.601
one, zero.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.531
Go ahead and throttle up.

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:52.884
You wanted an answer. You got one.

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:56.509
I always get what I want, Sam.
We just needed to be sure.

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.305
Sure of what?

01:29:58.435 --> 01:29:59.641
That they would go without a fight.

01:30:10.322 --> 01:30:12.153
- Say again.
- Tracking an incoming object.

01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:06.241
We all work for the Decepticons now.

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:14.336
I need your help to track a phone call.
There's a man on this phone.

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:16.463
He's the head of their human operations
and he has Carly hostage.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:18.385
I want you to sit down. Don't move.

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:21.802
Follow me.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:24.263
I'm watching him drive up right now.

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:29.814
The call was placed en route.

01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:32.142
I'm hacking into
the phone's camera now.

01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:34.606
There, that's it.
That's a live stream from the camera.

01:31:34.698 --> 01:31:37.030
Someplace... Hold on.
I can triangulate this.

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:40.404
Okay, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I've got it.

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:43.202
Trump Tower, Chicago.
Lower penthouse.

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:44.704
We're on.

01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:48.783
- I'm going.
- You sure?

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:51.585
She's done nothing but try to help me,
and I can be there in 15 hours.

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:53.914
You're not going alone.

01:31:56.428 --> 01:31:58.885
I still got my NEST friends out there.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.883
I'll round them up,
we'll find your girlfriend,

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.305
we're gonna bring this guy in.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.965
Why are you helping me?

01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:07.306
'Cause that asshole
killed my friends, too.

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:26.788
They said they were here for
our resources, to rebuild their planet.

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:30.117
Yes, but really
one resource in particular.

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:32.202
One unique to our planet.

01:32:33.923 --> 01:32:35.208
Us?

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:38.713
You're very smart.

01:32:38.803 --> 01:32:41.044
You see, they can't rebuild
without a slave labor force.

01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:44.881
How many rocks up there in
the universe offer six billion workers?

01:32:44.976 --> 01:32:48.139
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:51.642
They're not shipping people.
They're shipping their planet here.

01:32:57.655 --> 01:32:59.065
Oh, my God.

01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:01.731
What's Sentinel doing here?

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:05.569
Watch. They're spreading hundreds of
pillars around the globe right now.

01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:08.245
In just a few hours,
they're gonna launch them into orbit

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:11.575
and bring Cybertron
into our atmosphere.

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:13.785
The red one there controls the rest.

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.916
He triggers that,
it starts the whole thing.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:19.875
Be gone, insect operative.
Your work is done.

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:22.339
Your Excellency. He's such a dick.

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:30.135
- You want this to happen?
- I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:32.892
You think I asked for this?
I inherited a client.

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:35.598
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here
and we're all their slaves,

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:37.308
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:39.735
Don't jinx me.
You want to survive, you listen to me.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.630
It is time for the slaves of Earth
to recognize their masters.

01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:03.334
Seal off the city.

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:01.109
Get the dogs outta here now!
Get them in the back!

01:35:02.614 --> 01:35:04.775
I guess they didn't tell you about
this part, did they?

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:07.198
You think I'm at every meeting?

01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:09.526
Look, I'm safe.

01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:10.952
They said I was safe.

01:35:22.675 --> 01:35:23.710
Let's roll!

01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:31.965
We had a signal earlier.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.891
It's not working.

01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:42.643
This is a national emergency broadcast.

01:35:47.825 --> 01:35:50.942
Chicago has suffered a massive attack.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:02.795
Wrong way!

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.291
Get out of here! Go back!

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:19.850
There is a ring of alien ships
around Chicago.

01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:23.525
Our high-range bombers
were just knocked out of the sky.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:27.570
They can 't get through
enemy air defenses over the city.

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:29.113
Our satellites have been jammed.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.407
We have no way to monitor
the enemy's movement.

01:36:31.494 --> 01:36:34.361
Our old NEST teams are on stand-down
holding at Grissom Air Force Base.

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.070
We're about 10 minutes from
the battle zone.

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.828
We have Special Forces
trying to gain access to the city,

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:40.783
and infantry is staging at the perimeter.

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:43.540
Excuse me, excuse me,
it just doesn't make sense!

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:46.122
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:48.003
They keep shooting down our drones.

01:36:48.094 --> 01:36:49.425
They want us blind.

01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:52.591
But we do have
a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.

01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:54.968
Well, whoever's manning
these UAV drones,

01:36:55.059 --> 01:36:57.015
can we try to redirect them
toward Trump Tower?

01:36:57.103 --> 01:36:59.469
The kid, Witwickety,
was on his way to Chicago.

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:03.640
Said some point-man human op is there
for the Decepticons!

01:37:04.402 --> 01:37:05.812
Listen, if I know anything, I know this,

01:37:05.903 --> 01:37:09.020
that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.

01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:51.695
My God.

01:37:52.617 --> 01:37:55.279
We came here to find her
in the middle of all that?

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:57.782
Are we really going out there, Epps?

01:37:57.872 --> 01:37:59.203
I'm not going in there.

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:01.622
No one's going in.

01:38:08.383 --> 01:38:09.543
I am.

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:12.462
With or without you, I'll find her.

01:38:13.471 --> 01:38:16.713
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.
Is that what you want?

01:38:16.974 --> 01:38:18.339
Is that what you want?

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.513
You came all the way out here
to get yourself killed? Huh?

01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:22.639
Listen to what I'm saying.

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.470
She's here because of me.
Do you understand?

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:28.308
Listen, if you go in this building,
that's if she's even still alive,

01:38:28.403 --> 01:38:29.768
there's no way
you're gonna be able to reach her!

01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:31.693
What do you suggest I do?

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:34.155
It's over.

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:37.905
I'm sorry, but it's over.

01:38:38.538 --> 01:38:39.653
No.

01:38:39.956 --> 01:38:41.537
Incoming!

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:31.207
We will kill them all.

01:39:35.887 --> 01:39:38.048
Wreck ers, kill him!

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:41.805
This is going to hurt!

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:43.929
A lot!

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.187
Your leaders will now understand.

01:39:52.278 --> 01:39:55.566
Decepticons will never leave
your planet alone.

01:39:56.324 --> 01:39:59.487
And we needed them to believe
we had gone.

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:02.990
For today, in the name of freedom,

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.412
we take the battle to them!

01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:30.601
- I saw your ship blow up!
- The ship?

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:35.227
We were never in the ship!
We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:38.358
We were hidden
in the first booster rocket to separate.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:42.067
Splashed down back in the Atlantic,
just as planned.

01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:43.776
We ain't going nowhere.

01:40:43.913 --> 01:40:46.780
Yeah, no one's exiling us.

01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:52.918
The Autobots are staying right here.
We're gonna help you win this war.

01:40:53.172 --> 01:40:56.130
They're surrounding the city
to make a fortress

01:40:56.217 --> 01:40:59.459
so that no one can see
what they're up to inside.

01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:03.092
Our only chance
is the element of surprise.

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:04.843
I think I know where to look!

01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:09.685
Mini-drone is on approach
to Trump Tower.

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.311
You're telling me
Sam's headed into that?

01:41:15.987 --> 01:41:17.067
Poor kid.

01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:20.571
Probably never got close.

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:22.440
So, you can fly this thing, right?

01:41:23.995 --> 01:41:26.202
What is that... What is that?
What is that? So-so?

01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:29.663
So you so-so can fly this.
That feels terrible.

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.250
We're right behind you.

01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:41.425
All right, we're going in!

01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:09.283
The city is secure.

01:42:09.373 --> 01:42:12.331
The humans cannot stop us.

01:42:12.418 --> 01:42:14.750
As the afternoon falls,

01:42:14.837 --> 01:42:18.125
the rest of the pillars
will reach their launch position.

01:42:18.215 --> 01:42:23.050
This is the victory I promised you
so many years ago,

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:28.055
where we rebuild Cybertron together!

01:42:28.434 --> 01:42:31.267
I have deigned to work with you

01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:34.808
that our planet may survive!

01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:38.232
I will never work for you!

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:41.777
You would be wise
to remember the difference.

01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:06.252
I'm so sick of this.
I'm just sick of waiting.

01:43:09.642 --> 01:43:10.757
Where is she?

01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:12.390
Where is she?

01:43:14.146 --> 01:43:15.261
You've got some balls.

01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:28.782
No, Sam!

01:43:30.705 --> 01:43:34.573
No! No, no!

01:43:38.462 --> 01:43:39.702
Carly!

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:42.250
Carly!

01:43:44.927 --> 01:43:46.292
Jump!

01:44:20.254 --> 01:44:22.245
Bee, fire!

01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:23.955
Bee!

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:49.780
Autobots! They're alive!

01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:53.693
Decepticons, defend the pillar!

01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:59.540
Raise the bridges! Find them!

01:45:14.558 --> 01:45:15.593
Sam.

01:45:17.561 --> 01:45:18.676
You found me.

01:45:18.771 --> 01:45:20.102
I'd follow you anywhere.

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:35.242
Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!

01:45:35.329 --> 01:45:36.660
Well, you're crazy.

01:45:38.123 --> 01:45:39.954
What is that? Is that us?

01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:43.868
This thing's a military UAV.
Stone, check and see if it's still working.

01:45:44.088 --> 01:45:45.373
Yeah, it's still got power.

01:45:45.464 --> 01:45:46.829
Flight Control, do you copy?

01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:49.544
Can... Can you rotate?
Can you do something?

01:45:49.927 --> 01:45:51.258
I think we got something.

01:45:51.345 --> 01:45:53.085
Epps! We got Epps!

01:45:54.139 --> 01:45:55.925
Come on, work! Work!

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:57.301
All right, turn the volume up on that!

01:45:57.601 --> 01:45:58.716
The kid!

01:45:58.811 --> 01:46:00.927
Can you rotate or something?

01:46:02.064 --> 01:46:04.851
Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay.
They can see us.

01:46:04.942 --> 01:46:06.682
Chicago is ground zero,
do you understand?

01:46:06.777 --> 01:46:09.189
- Can you hear us? You understand?
- Witwicky.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.645
Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here

01:46:10.739 --> 01:46:12.195
and he has the pillars
to his space bridge.

01:46:12.283 --> 01:46:13.773
They're on top of a building
on Chicago River.

01:46:13.868 --> 01:46:15.278
It's owned by
Hotchkiss Gould Investments.

01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:18.156
Now, the pillar that controls everything
is in the southeast cupola.

01:46:18.455 --> 01:46:20.662
You've got to destroy the pillar.
You have to shoot down the pillar

01:46:20.749 --> 01:46:22.956
or they're going to transport
Cybertron here, do you understand?

01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:24.579
- Do you understand?
- What?

01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:28.379
Give me a G PS on the building
and on that drone! Let's go!

01:46:28.465 --> 01:46:30.421
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.

01:46:30.676 --> 01:46:32.257
Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.

01:46:32.344 --> 01:46:33.379
The southeast cupola.

01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:34.755
All right!

01:46:35.806 --> 01:46:38.297
We need to move
before the fighters spot us.

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:40.633
Wait here until we scout a route ahead.

01:46:40.978 --> 01:46:42.809
- Let's roll.
- Ratchet, cover high.

01:46:43.981 --> 01:46:46.688
Hey, think we could use that rock et
to shoot down the pillar?

01:46:46.775 --> 01:46:49.437
We're eight blocks away.
We got to get closer to take a shot.

01:46:49.612 --> 01:46:52.649
Not closer. Higher.
We need a clear line of sight.

01:46:52.823 --> 01:46:55.815
And it's across the river. Gonna have
a hell of a time trying to sneak up.

01:46:56.201 --> 01:46:57.566
We only got one shot.

01:46:58.662 --> 01:47:00.323
One shot's all we need.

01:47:01.206 --> 01:47:03.743
We got to be able to see
around that building from the ground.

01:47:03.834 --> 01:47:06.667
Get NSA to send service specs for
any cameras in that area.

01:47:06.754 --> 01:47:07.789
Maybe some are working.

01:47:08.213 --> 01:47:11.000
Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.

01:47:11.675 --> 01:47:14.212
Listen up. You want to hit back?

01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:18.546
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.
It's the only way to get close.

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:22.262
I can't promise anyone a ride home,
but if you're with me,

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:24.681
the world needs you now.

01:47:25.314 --> 01:47:27.680
I'll find my own ride home, sir.

01:47:30.527 --> 01:47:31.642
Who else?

01:47:34.907 --> 01:47:36.022
General Morshower,

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:38.607
requesting diversionary action
to the south of the city.

01:47:38.702 --> 01:47:41.034
We're coming north and low.
You guys drive them to the east.

01:47:58.055 --> 01:48:00.262
Autobot victory! Autobot victory!

01:48:32.715 --> 01:48:35.548
That is one scary-ass Decepticon!

01:48:35.634 --> 01:48:39.627
They got my trailer.
I need that flight tech.

01:48:40.097 --> 01:48:44.261
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.
Wreck ers,

01:48:44.977 --> 01:48:46.683
we need a diversion.

01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:49.432
- Let's get some!
- You got that right.

01:48:49.815 --> 01:48:52.682
Listen, we're gonna circle around
to that glass building.

01:48:52.776 --> 01:48:54.732
And we'll get high enough
to make the rocket shot

01:48:55.029 --> 01:48:56.360
while you guys draw his fire.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:57.937
- Let's move!
- Wait a minute!

01:48:58.032 --> 01:49:01.365
I'm not letting you go out there
without my urban combat prototypes.

01:49:01.452 --> 01:49:03.113
- We got to go, Que!
- Come on.

01:49:03.245 --> 01:49:05.201
They're great inventions for kicking ass!

01:49:05.289 --> 01:49:06.369
What are these?

01:49:06.457 --> 01:49:10.200
Those are boom-sticks.
Armed in 30 seconds.

01:49:10.294 --> 01:49:12.000
Grapple gloves, for climbing.

01:49:12.921 --> 01:49:14.411
Go, go! Move your ass! Move, move!

01:49:14.506 --> 01:49:17.088
Move, move! Go, go, go!

01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:24.133
- Move, move!
- Let's go!

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:37.601
Let's go! Run!

01:49:44.953 --> 01:49:46.363
- Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
- No, no, no!

01:49:46.455 --> 01:49:48.946
- Where you going?
- Stop, stop, stop! Don't leave!

01:49:49.041 --> 01:49:52.875
You never leave a 'bot behind!
Shockwave's coming!

01:49:57.633 --> 01:49:58.748
Go for the stairs!

01:49:58.842 --> 01:50:00.457
Epps, this way!

01:50:01.887 --> 01:50:03.627
Breaking right.

01:50:03.722 --> 01:50:05.053
Bead. Rolling in.

01:50:10.187 --> 01:50:11.302
We got another one coming around.

01:50:11.396 --> 01:50:13.478
Coming around on the left side,
coming around on the right side.

01:50:13.565 --> 01:50:15.931
We're going to use Willis Tower
for cover!

01:50:16.026 --> 01:50:17.891
Once we make altitude, we jump!

01:50:17.986 --> 01:50:20.898
- A lot of airplanes out here!
- Contact off the nose.

01:50:23.242 --> 01:50:24.652
Mayday! I don't think
he's gonna make it.

01:50:24.743 --> 01:50:27.359
- Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.
- Heads up! Heads up!

01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:33.373
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:50:42.594 --> 01:50:45.006
- Tally on the left.
- Got him.

01:50:47.141 --> 01:50:49.302
Here we go! Here we go!

01:50:49.601 --> 01:50:51.011
Keep it tight!

01:50:51.103 --> 01:50:52.218
Coming around.

01:50:52.437 --> 01:50:54.428
All right, focus, focus, focus.

01:50:59.444 --> 01:51:01.184
Threat above tower, six o'clock!

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.565
Locusts!

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:04.317
Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!

01:51:06.743 --> 01:51:09.701
- Watch out, watch out!
- Holy shit!

01:51:11.748 --> 01:51:13.158
Look out, look out, look out!

01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:14.410
Get them out, get them out,
get them out!

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.742
- Everybody out, out, out!
- Jump, jump, jump!

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.049
Get out, get out!

01:51:25.137 --> 01:51:26.172
I'm stuck!

01:51:26.722 --> 01:51:28.212
Now. Get them out now!
Get them out now!

01:51:29.099 --> 01:51:30.589
Help!

01:51:50.454 --> 01:51:52.786
Get separation.
Track away, track away!

01:52:12.935 --> 01:52:14.800
Hard left! Hard left!

01:52:16.063 --> 01:52:18.019
Six hundred feet.

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:35.116
Check your six! Check your six!

01:52:35.249 --> 01:52:38.582
He's on our ass! Watch out, watch out!

01:52:42.673 --> 01:52:43.708
Sharp right!

01:52:49.346 --> 01:52:50.506
Building dead ahead!

01:52:50.806 --> 01:52:52.137
Thread the needle!

01:53:01.692 --> 01:53:03.353
Pull, pull!

01:53:06.363 --> 01:53:08.354
- Come on, we're high enough!
- This is a mother getting up here!

01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:10.234
- Get your fat ass over here!
- I'm coming.

01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:17.951
Set up the rocket!

01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:20.866
- They're coming.
- Weapons status?

01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:23.043
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.

01:53:25.382 --> 01:53:28.624
There, the building with the dome.

01:53:28.802 --> 01:53:32.294
For our brothers,
let's make this trip worth it.

01:53:35.434 --> 01:53:36.469
Oh, God.

01:53:39.354 --> 01:53:40.844
The building!

01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:46.732
They're shooting at the building!

01:53:50.032 --> 01:53:51.112
This is not a good idea.

01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:52.814
- What?
- This is not a good idea.

01:53:52.909 --> 01:53:54.365
- This building is unstable.
- Listen, stop for a second.

01:53:54.453 --> 01:53:56.489
If we don't do what we came to do,
it doesn't matter, we all die.

01:53:56.621 --> 01:53:58.612
Right? That's your target.
Come on, man!

01:53:58.749 --> 01:54:00.489
I don't even care
if the building collapses.

01:54:00.584 --> 01:54:02.074
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

01:54:03.712 --> 01:54:05.327
The building is going over!

01:54:05.422 --> 01:54:06.753
- Hang on!
- Tak e cover!

01:54:11.219 --> 01:54:13.084
Keep your hands up!

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:25.935
It's okay! It stopped!

01:54:26.401 --> 01:54:27.857
Guys, look!

01:54:27.944 --> 01:54:30.606
- Incoming, incoming!
- Everybody hide!

01:54:58.767 --> 01:55:01.053
Don't move.

01:55:06.274 --> 01:55:07.480
Go, go.

01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:15.526
Run!

01:55:15.617 --> 01:55:17.153
Cover fire!

01:55:19.496 --> 01:55:22.863
Shoot the glass! Jump out the window!

01:55:29.339 --> 01:55:30.419
Jump!

01:55:46.356 --> 01:55:49.848
We're gonna die!

01:55:51.403 --> 01:55:53.268
Sam, I can't stop!

01:55:53.697 --> 01:55:55.562
Shoot the glass!

01:56:21.224 --> 01:56:22.304
Sam!

01:56:47.792 --> 01:56:50.124
Is everybody okay?

01:56:50.212 --> 01:56:51.247
You okay?

01:56:51.338 --> 01:56:52.669
What the hell was that?

01:56:52.923 --> 01:56:55.881
Driller-bot is thirsty.

01:56:59.262 --> 01:57:01.253
- This evil thing's looking at me!
- What?

01:57:14.277 --> 01:57:16.484
It's even got an uglier
Decepticon with it!

01:57:16.571 --> 01:57:17.811
We have to evac!

01:57:36.424 --> 01:57:40.133
- Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!
- We're trapped!

01:57:40.637 --> 01:57:42.844
Okay. How do we get out of here?
Hey! Come on!

01:57:42.931 --> 01:57:45.217
Oh, Lord Jesus,
let me just get out of this alive.

01:57:56.027 --> 01:57:57.733
Move! We got to move!

01:57:57.821 --> 01:57:59.937
Why do the Decepticons
always get the good shit?

01:58:00.031 --> 01:58:01.862
- Move!
- We're about to be eaten, people!

01:58:24.389 --> 01:58:26.175
We're gonna die!

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:44.280
- Hold on!
- Give me your hand!

01:58:44.451 --> 01:58:45.941
- I'm swinging that way!
- Got her!

01:58:46.036 --> 01:58:47.572
Oh, my God!

01:58:47.662 --> 01:58:50.028
I'm dropping you on the fire escape!

01:59:07.432 --> 01:59:08.467
Sam!

01:59:09.726 --> 01:59:11.591
We gotta move!

01:59:24.824 --> 01:59:27.611
I'm coming for you!

02:00:22.549 --> 02:00:23.880
Optimus!

02:00:23.967 --> 02:00:26.629
- Wreckers!
- We're coming!

02:00:27.804 --> 02:00:30.671
Decepticons around the world,

02:00:30.765 --> 02:00:32.721
launch the pillars.

02:01:03.673 --> 02:01:06.085
We are so lost!

02:01:06.176 --> 02:01:07.507
Always left out.

02:01:08.678 --> 02:01:10.418
Ka-ching!

02:01:12.599 --> 02:01:14.339
It's time to lay down the law.

02:01:14.434 --> 02:01:15.970
About to bring some hurt now.

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:26.355
It's starting! You see it?

02:01:29.574 --> 02:01:31.235
Look out!

02:01:39.292 --> 02:01:41.123
Where are Sam and Carly?

02:01:43.213 --> 02:01:44.919
We'll go this way.

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:53.381
I give you one thing to do,

02:01:53.473 --> 02:01:55.429
one thing to do,
and you drop the ball on that?

02:01:55.517 --> 02:01:57.132
I ain't signed up for all this!

02:01:57.227 --> 02:01:59.434
Got aliens blasting at me,
running around, chasing me!

02:01:59.521 --> 02:02:01.762
I'm ducking through churches and
buildings and all that kind of crap!

02:02:01.856 --> 02:02:04.814
This is bullshit!
I ain't signed up for this, Epps.

02:02:04.901 --> 02:02:06.061
I'm trying to keep it together.

02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:13.865
- What a treat! You and me, alone!
- Carly!

02:02:19.249 --> 02:02:20.739
Come on, come on! Run!

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:25.956
Okay. He's after me, not you.

02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:27.920
Run!

02:02:29.425 --> 02:02:31.837
You can't hide, boy!

02:02:34.764 --> 02:02:39.007
I just love it when
your little insect feet try to run!

02:02:39.102 --> 02:02:40.558
- Sam!
- Run!

02:02:45.859 --> 02:02:48.100
I thought you were working for us, boy?

02:02:52.115 --> 02:02:54.652
No! Sam!

02:03:04.127 --> 02:03:05.742
My eye!

02:03:18.057 --> 02:03:19.593
My eye!

02:03:22.145 --> 02:03:24.761
Target the Decepticon!

02:03:31.821 --> 02:03:33.027
Sam!

02:03:37.994 --> 02:03:39.359
Please, you've got to save Sam!

02:03:39.454 --> 02:03:40.864
- You've got to save him!
- What the hell is he doing?

02:03:44.417 --> 02:03:45.998
This better work.

02:03:46.127 --> 02:03:48.209
D-Bots! D-Bots!

02:04:01.225 --> 02:04:03.716
I can't see! I can't see!

02:04:03.853 --> 02:04:04.888
Sam!

02:04:04.979 --> 02:04:06.844
It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!

02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:08.225
- I'm trying!
- Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

02:04:08.733 --> 02:04:12.442
The bomb's gonna blow!
The bomb's gonna...

02:04:12.528 --> 02:04:14.484
You human scum!

02:04:14.572 --> 02:04:16.483
- We got 20 seconds on that bomb!
- What bomb?

02:04:16.574 --> 02:04:17.609
You see that bomb?

02:04:17.951 --> 02:04:20.112
- Cut it, cut it, cut it!
- I got it!

02:04:20.244 --> 02:04:22.075
How long do we have?

02:04:22.872 --> 02:04:25.659
I'm gonna kick you!

02:04:34.217 --> 02:04:35.627
Cut, cut, cut!

02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:39.211
I'm gonna kill...

02:04:56.072 --> 02:04:58.028
Well, he's dead.

02:05:00.243 --> 02:05:02.575
Hey, Bee's going to run with
the rest of the Autobots

02:05:02.662 --> 02:05:03.947
- and meet us at the edge of the river.
- All right.

02:05:32.567 --> 02:05:35.604
It sucked me in!
There was nothing I could do!

02:05:37.321 --> 02:05:38.936
This is a total cluster...

02:05:39.615 --> 02:05:42.106
We got to get across the river.

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:43.862
You see that? She said the control pillar

02:05:43.953 --> 02:05:45.193
- was in that first cupola.
- All right.

02:05:45.705 --> 02:05:48.287
Let's go! Move! Let's move!

02:05:48.833 --> 02:05:50.869
Tomahawks are inbound.

02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:55.290
I'm in the traffic cameras.

02:05:56.132 --> 02:05:58.168
Four Autobots are captured.

02:05:58.384 --> 02:06:00.295
Oh, my God. We're helpless.

02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:03.177
Whatever's set to happen,
with those pulses getting faster,

02:06:03.264 --> 02:06:04.470
it's gonna happen soon.

02:06:05.141 --> 02:06:06.756
No sign of Optimus.

02:06:07.643 --> 02:06:10.055
How do we get these bridges down?

02:06:10.855 --> 02:06:13.096
Spread out. Check in there.

02:06:14.901 --> 02:06:15.936
Epps!

02:06:16.027 --> 02:06:18.063
Epps, I've been looking for your ass.
How you doing?

02:06:18.154 --> 02:06:20.736
Retirement is wack. Even worse,

02:06:20.823 --> 02:06:22.563
we can't get across the river
to that building,

02:06:22.658 --> 02:06:24.569
and the Autobots
are upstairs, surrounded.

02:06:30.875 --> 02:06:32.240
Just pan the camera around, all right?

02:06:32.335 --> 02:06:34.246
All right. Pan... Pan right. That's you.

02:06:35.338 --> 02:06:37.454
Try getting into the bridge control room.

02:06:39.509 --> 02:06:41.670
What are they doing?
They're just standing there.

02:06:41.761 --> 02:06:45.674
Hang on. Dutch, see if you can
hack into the bridge.

02:06:46.557 --> 02:06:48.639
Sir, SEALs are here.

02:06:48.726 --> 02:06:50.557
It's a good day, boys! What do you got?

02:06:50.645 --> 02:06:52.761
Got a 10-man SEAL unit, sir,
tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.

02:06:52.855 --> 02:06:53.844
- How long?
- Fifteen.

02:06:54.065 --> 02:06:57.728
- You're my prisoners!
- Take it easy. We surrender.

02:06:58.528 --> 02:06:59.859
Get off me.

02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:02.191
Get off me!

02:07:02.698 --> 02:07:05.485
All right, you're gonna need your
40 Mike-Mikes and frags. Go full auto.

02:07:05.576 --> 02:07:09.444
The vibrations jack up their circuits.
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.

02:07:09.539 --> 02:07:12.201
All right, your target is up
on top of that building, that cupola.

02:07:12.542 --> 02:07:15.284
How doomed you are, Autobots.

02:07:15.378 --> 02:07:17.790
You simply fail to understand

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:22.214
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:25.047
Activating the bridge.

02:07:36.566 --> 02:07:38.397
They happy about something.

02:07:38.776 --> 02:07:40.641
We're in the heart of their ship.

02:07:40.736 --> 02:07:42.692
Let's give 'em a little ride.

02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:45.112
We gonna screw this ship up.

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:47.903
It's a 128K binary encryption code.

02:07:49.245 --> 02:07:50.906
It's difficult.

02:07:51.497 --> 02:07:54.489
But not for me. I'm in. Bridge down.

02:07:56.002 --> 02:07:58.414
The bridge is coming down!
Someone's watching over us!

02:07:59.046 --> 02:08:00.582
Come on! Let's go!

02:08:00.798 --> 02:08:03.289
"Pleasure working with you, Seymour."

02:08:03.384 --> 02:08:05.090
I believe you're supposed to say.

02:08:05.928 --> 02:08:07.418
Good job, Dutch.

02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:15.851
Get off me!

02:08:40.671 --> 02:08:43.253
Hurry! They're triggering the pillars!

02:08:44.508 --> 02:08:46.669
Prisoners? You're keeping prisoners?

02:08:47.011 --> 02:08:48.967
Yes.

02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:50.795
You need to teach them about respect.

02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:53.381
This was all business, but now
it's personal, do you understand me?

02:08:54.977 --> 02:08:59.971
I understand.
No prisoners, only trophies.

02:09:00.816 --> 02:09:04.434
Bee, I think they're going to kill us.

02:09:05.488 --> 02:09:08.730
- You, your time is up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

02:09:08.824 --> 02:09:11.110
We surrendered! We're your prisoners.

02:09:11.202 --> 02:09:13.409
- Move it!
- Can't we talk this out?

02:09:13.496 --> 02:09:17.114
We're all a bunch of good chaps!
I mean you no...

02:09:19.835 --> 02:09:21.871
Why did you...

02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:30.961
Good-bye, my old friend.

02:09:32.181 --> 02:09:34.012
You're mine now.

02:09:47.530 --> 02:09:48.861
Get off me!

02:09:49.532 --> 02:09:50.988
- I got to help him.
- What?

02:09:51.826 --> 02:09:53.282
What are you doing?

02:09:53.369 --> 02:09:55.860
- I got to help him.
- Sam, you can't help him.

02:10:03.879 --> 02:10:06.120
Turn around.

02:10:15.057 --> 02:10:17.639
We... We gave 'em a hell of a run.

02:10:33.576 --> 02:10:35.191
We did it, Brains! We did it!

02:10:35.286 --> 02:10:36.822
Rip this ship apart!

02:11:15.451 --> 02:11:18.067
- We had a nice run, Brains, you and me.
- Yeah, we gonna die.

02:11:34.762 --> 02:11:37.469
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, baby!
You all come with us!

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:40.847
Go! You guys,
follow that ground team! Go!

02:11:40.935 --> 02:11:44.177
- Move, move, move!
- Epps, third floor! We're going to 45!

02:11:49.819 --> 02:11:51.434
All right. Two snipers, right here!

02:11:53.489 --> 02:11:54.478
All right, dock up!

02:11:56.117 --> 02:11:57.982
We jump in three minutes!

02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:02.991
Set up shop right here.

02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:08.701
Set up.

02:12:10.631 --> 02:12:11.996
I'm downstairs.

02:12:12.091 --> 02:12:14.673
We got five targets
and Shockwave right below us.

02:12:14.927 --> 02:12:16.667
Stand by to jump!

02:12:16.762 --> 02:12:19.094
All right, let's go! Get ready, get ready.

02:12:32.403 --> 02:12:34.018
Go!

02:12:43.873 --> 02:12:45.613
Snipers, take out their eyes.

02:12:49.378 --> 02:12:50.868
All right, demo team, let's crank steel.

02:12:59.096 --> 02:13:01.132
Turning steel!

02:13:37.259 --> 02:13:38.669
Don't fire till I tell you!

02:13:49.522 --> 02:13:50.932
Go!

02:13:52.816 --> 02:13:54.352
Good job, kid!

02:13:54.443 --> 02:13:55.478
Fire!

02:14:07.748 --> 02:14:09.284
- We got him!
- Yeah!

02:14:10.459 --> 02:14:12.074
He's on the run!

02:14:14.421 --> 02:14:16.503
Autobots, attack!

02:14:21.804 --> 02:14:23.760
Mortar that bridge!

02:14:27.434 --> 02:14:29.766
It's our world now!

02:14:30.646 --> 02:14:32.637
Commence transport!

02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:47.276
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:03.258
Optimus!

02:15:38.213 --> 02:15:40.204
You die!

02:15:48.223 --> 02:15:49.508
No!

02:16:00.110 --> 02:16:02.396
Get down here, Sentinel!

02:16:02.488 --> 02:16:04.570
Optimus,

02:16:04.657 --> 02:16:06.568
you forget your place!

02:16:13.415 --> 02:16:17.078
I bring you Cybertron, your home,

02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:21.083
and still you choose humanity.

02:16:21.173 --> 02:16:25.086
You were the one who taught me
freedom is everyone's right.

02:16:28.597 --> 02:16:30.838
I will retrigger that pillar!

02:16:30.933 --> 02:16:34.016
Then you'll have to go through me!

02:16:38.022 --> 02:16:39.513
Okay, I've got to try and help.

02:16:39.608 --> 02:16:41.519
- I have to. You stay here.
- Don't you go. Don't go.

02:16:41.610 --> 02:16:44.977
You'll be fine, okay? I promise.
I got to get to that pillar.

02:16:47.241 --> 02:16:49.072
Charge the pillar!

02:16:49.159 --> 02:16:50.490
We got Autobots!

02:17:07.803 --> 02:17:09.759
Reinforcements!

02:17:09.847 --> 02:17:12.680
Decepticon ships, fire at Optimus!

02:17:17.228 --> 02:17:19.891
We're taking fire!
I need those Tomahawks now!

02:17:20.148 --> 02:17:21.763
First wave inbound.

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:30.522
We've got to cover for Optimus!

02:17:44.673 --> 02:17:47.835
Decepticons, trigger the pillar!

02:17:48.552 --> 02:17:50.543
Restart that pillar!

02:17:51.013 --> 02:17:52.423
Trigger the pillars.

02:17:53.307 --> 02:17:57.549
I can't hold them!
The ships have us pinned!

02:17:58.270 --> 02:17:59.680
No!

02:18:00.022 --> 02:18:02.558
Inbound, 10 seconds! Danger close!

02:18:02.648 --> 02:18:04.934
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!

02:18:05.027 --> 02:18:06.267
Positive surface contact.

02:18:06.361 --> 02:18:07.851
- Target I. D.
- Target acquired.

02:18:36.433 --> 02:18:39.014
- Dylan! Wait!
- No!

02:18:42.022 --> 02:18:43.057
Dylan!

02:18:44.148 --> 02:18:45.558
Stop! Stop!

02:18:45.901 --> 02:18:47.141
No!

02:18:47.736 --> 02:18:49.647
You can't do this, okay?

02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.236
There's only one future for me.

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:22.518
Cybertron, you are saved, at last.

02:19:31.530 --> 02:19:34.647
Have you come to surrender?

02:19:35.075 --> 02:19:37.486
- Was it all worth it?
- Obviously.

02:19:37.577 --> 02:19:41.617
All your work to bring Sentinel back
and now clearly he has all the power.

02:19:41.999 --> 02:19:43.785
It's actually almost tragic.

02:19:43.876 --> 02:19:46.993
You dare lecture me, slave?

02:19:47.087 --> 02:19:49.669
Your Decepticons
finally conquering this planet,

02:19:49.756 --> 02:19:51.087
and yet, their leader won't be you!

02:19:51.174 --> 02:19:55.508
It will be me! It will always be me.

02:19:56.597 --> 02:19:58.679
In any minute now,

02:19:58.765 --> 02:20:02.599
you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.

02:20:09.776 --> 02:20:11.437
Rock et!

02:20:12.905 --> 02:20:14.111
Die!

02:20:26.668 --> 02:20:27.999
You chose sides?

02:20:29.129 --> 02:20:30.164
You chose wrong.

02:20:36.345 --> 02:20:39.178
Always the bravest of us!

02:20:42.184 --> 02:20:44.721
But you could never make
the hard decisions!

02:20:47.773 --> 02:20:50.810
Our planet will survive!

02:20:51.777 --> 02:20:52.983
No!

02:21:02.871 --> 02:21:05.908
We were gods once. All of us.

02:21:06.041 --> 02:21:08.373
- But here...
- Please!

02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:10.872
...there will only be one!

02:21:21.807 --> 02:21:25.516
This is my planet!

02:21:36.238 --> 02:21:38.194
I just saved a whole other world.

02:21:38.407 --> 02:21:41.240
You think you're a hero, huh?
You think you're a hero?

02:21:41.576 --> 02:21:44.033
No. I'm just a messenger.

02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:53.126
The pillar's still connected!

02:21:55.048 --> 02:21:56.458
Bring it up!

02:21:56.758 --> 02:21:58.965
- Bee! Let's do this!
- Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

02:21:59.052 --> 02:22:00.667
Pillar's still connected!

02:22:00.762 --> 02:22:03.003
Rip that pillar down!

02:22:26.288 --> 02:22:30.031
Now, we need a truce.

02:22:30.125 --> 02:22:33.538
All I want is to be back in charge.

02:22:33.628 --> 02:22:35.710
Besides,

02:22:35.797 --> 02:22:39.585
who would you be without me, Prime?

02:22:39.676 --> 02:22:42.088
Time to find out.

02:23:04.618 --> 02:23:07.735
Optimus, all I ever wanted

02:23:07.829 --> 02:23:10.320
was the survival of our race.

02:23:10.749 --> 02:23:15.083
You must see why I had to betray you.

02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:17.502
You didn't betray me.

02:23:18.006 --> 02:23:20.338
You betrayed yourself.

02:23:20.675 --> 02:23:22.211
No, Optimus!

02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:19.981
Sam.

02:24:59.274 --> 02:25:02.107
I love you.

02:25:03.486 --> 02:25:04.726
You're the only thing
I need in this world,

02:25:04.821 --> 02:25:07.437
and I'll do anything to make it up to you,
I promise.

02:25:08.074 --> 02:25:10.690
I'm going to hold you to that.

02:25:10.785 --> 02:25:12.275
Just never let me go.

02:25:13.205 --> 02:25:14.820
I promise.

02:25:20.128 --> 02:25:21.584
Rings.

02:25:29.387 --> 02:25:30.968
I love this car.

02:25:31.264 --> 02:25:35.052
Bee, you've got to slow it down.
You got to slow way down, okay?

02:25:35.936 --> 02:25:37.176
I'm just trying to help out.

02:25:39.314 --> 02:25:40.975
In any war

02:25:41.107 --> 02:25:44.099
there are calms between storms.

02:25:44.819 --> 02:25:46.025
You fought bravely.

02:25:46.112 --> 02:25:48.728
There will be days when we lose faith.

02:25:48.823 --> 02:25:51.656
Days when our allies turn against us.

02:25:52.327 --> 02:25:56.741
But the day will never come
that we forsake this planet

02:25:56.998 --> 02:25:59.489
and its people.

02:26:20.814 --> 02:26:25.023
That's what I call
the start of a beautiful future.

02:26:26.194 --> 02:26:28.150
Arrest him.

02:26:28.321 --> 02:26:29.356
It was worth it!

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:31.529
- Get him out of here!
- I'd go to jail for love! I don't care!

02:26:31.741 --> 02:26:34.608
Go ahead, take me in! I want to go in!
Let's go in.

02:26:34.703 --> 02:26:36.534
Come on, Charlotte,
take me in right now!
