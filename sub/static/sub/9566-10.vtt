Transcript: chocolate

00:25.200 --> 00:27.880
Synch: Arrow, Breys, Walid20-101

02:43.745 --> 02:45.821
- Morning, slugger.
- Where are we?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.725
Thought you were the man
with the plan.

02:49.221 --> 02:50.221
I am.

02:53.825 --> 02:54.825
I am.

02:58.969 --> 02:59.969
I am.

03:01.284 --> 03:04.607
It's been weeks, Cook.
One small shitty town after another.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.869
It's not about the destination.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.920
It's about the journey.

03:09.845 --> 03:11.680
'09 Bonnie and Clyde.

03:12.653 --> 03:14.158
Outlaw tour of Britain.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.564
I'm serious, Cook.

03:16.594 --> 03:17.972
Where are we going?

03:22.468 --> 03:23.518
We're here.

03:25.534 --> 03:26.400
This is it.

03:27.716 --> 03:29.560
- Here?
- Here. This town.

03:32.217 --> 03:33.217
Why?

03:38.205 --> 03:40.252
Because this is where my dad lives.

04:12.651 --> 04:14.294
Aren't you coming with me?

04:14.693 --> 04:15.693
Not yet.

04:17.274 --> 04:19.908
But I want you to meet him.
I brought you here to meet him.

04:20.028 --> 04:21.156
I will.

04:21.276 --> 04:23.320
But I think
you need to meet him first.

04:24.901 --> 04:26.372
Don't be a pussy.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.271
Be careful.

05:28.867 --> 05:30.497
Ladies and germs,

05:30.617 --> 05:32.719
the fucking Milky Bars are on me.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.706
Drinks all round, yeah?

05:34.920 --> 05:37.240
Everyone, the fruit of my looms.

05:37.401 --> 05:38.735
My fucking son.

05:39.181 --> 05:41.951
And this is
his very lovely ladyfriend.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.855
Pints and shots over here, <i>monsieur</i>,

05:44.975 --> 05:47.680
and make it snappy,
my mouth's as dry as a nun's.

05:48.727 --> 05:51.240
Have a view at the only copper
for 40 miles.

05:53.582 --> 05:55.239
Do what you like. Smoke inside.

05:55.401 --> 05:58.254
Ash on the fucking floor,
see if anyone bats an eyelid.

05:58.374 --> 06:00.262
In fact... piss on it.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.213
There's a couple of old boys
would pay top dollar to see that.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.857
This ain't Kansas any more, Toto.

06:06.977 --> 06:10.120
- Out here you are free as fuck.
- A-fucking-men.

06:12.151 --> 06:13.685
Right, here we go.

06:14.984 --> 06:18.629
You get one round
on account of your lad being here.

06:18.749 --> 06:21.600
Donald, how am I meant
to clear my tab?

06:23.083 --> 06:26.287
Your wife's away so much
I hardly get a chance to see to her.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.360
That's £345...

06:30.975 --> 06:31.975
23 pence.

06:35.399 --> 06:38.526
"That's £345 pounds... 23 pence."

06:39.163 --> 06:40.039
Dick.

06:40.159 --> 06:43.160
The only thing that matters
to shitheads like him is money.

06:43.345 --> 06:45.042
It's a fucking disgrace, Dad.

06:45.162 --> 06:47.680
I mean, there's got to be more
to life than that, am I right?

06:47.840 --> 06:49.117
Like what?

06:49.596 --> 06:50.842
- Fucking.
- Shagging.

06:52.497 --> 06:53.960
Great minds, Son.

06:54.271 --> 06:55.320
Great minds.

06:55.700 --> 06:59.043
Everyone knows the best things
in life are free.

06:59.754 --> 07:01.340
Never a truer word, Dad.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.799
Can't believe it.

07:07.770 --> 07:08.480
This.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.552
Feels all right, don't it?
Me and you,

07:14.672 --> 07:16.504
back together. At last.

07:16.788 --> 07:18.628
I'm like a dog with two dicks!

07:19.495 --> 07:21.653
There's nothing more important

07:21.993 --> 07:23.209
than blood.

07:25.849 --> 07:27.547
Isn't that right, princess?

07:37.459 --> 07:39.760
I can't find item 47758 anywhere.

07:44.301 --> 07:46.663
Someone's made
a very inconvenient error.

07:46.881 --> 07:48.473
If we have to go
through all the 477s

07:48.593 --> 07:51.160
I'm going to be piqued,
not to mention vexed.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.741
Especially if someone's...

07:58.965 --> 08:00.892
- You all right?
- Yep, don't worry.

08:01.012 --> 08:03.141
My back and skull
cushioned the fall.

08:09.154 --> 08:11.281
Here's item 47758.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.818
I told you to be more careful
on the step ladder, J.

08:13.938 --> 08:16.041
Stupid old useless, mental me.

08:17.156 --> 08:19.005
You're not useless, just...

08:22.714 --> 08:24.301
Who loses a toilet seat on a bus?

08:25.399 --> 08:27.141
The 477s are all from trains.

08:32.341 --> 08:33.847
Have you got{\, like some kind of} a problem with me?

08:33.967 --> 08:36.780
I just wish you wouldn't smoke
so much weed while we're working.

08:36.900 --> 08:40.013
- Why? They don't care.
- It's just a bit boring sometimes.

08:40.902 --> 08:42.328
Are you saying I'm boring?

08:49.853 --> 08:51.505
Right, so what's next on the list?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.407
- Look, Fred, sorry.
- It's fine.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.141
- Please, I'm sorry, Fred.
- It's... fine.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.520
For flip's sake!
Stop saying it's fine!

08:59.680 --> 09:02.517
It's not fine! Nothing's fine!
It's all... smegged, OK?

09:02.637 --> 09:04.720
You're really getting the hang
of this swearing stuff.

09:04.881 --> 09:06.049
How about this, then?

09:06.169 --> 09:09.599
I mother-fucking, fanny-farting,
cock-munching resign!

09:10.670 --> 09:13.174
- {\What do you mean }You're quitting? You can't quit.
- I can.

09:13.294 --> 09:14.854
I learned from the best.

09:17.545 --> 09:19.282
You've still got the toilet seat.

09:37.806 --> 09:39.480
Are you... Effy's friend?

09:41.098 --> 09:42.930
I think so. Are you her mum?

09:45.011 --> 09:45.960
Can I sit?

09:51.543 --> 09:53.496
JJ, right? The magician.

09:54.966 --> 09:56.316
I used to do magic.

09:56.834 --> 09:59.426
- Not any more, though.
- I used to be married.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.239
Not any more, though.

10:07.685 --> 10:09.318
Pick a card, any card.

10:10.121 --> 10:11.454
I thought you gave up.

10:12.604 --> 10:15.320
Some things are quite hard
to let go of.

10:19.540 --> 10:20.957
Effy likes magic.

10:21.752 --> 10:23.636
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, not the...

10:23.756 --> 10:26.467
you know, stupid abracadabra sort.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.174
I'm so sorry.

10:28.789 --> 10:29.789
It's OK.

10:30.227 --> 10:32.227
I've come to terms with the facts.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.100
You know...

10:36.103 --> 10:38.840
She was four years old the first time
she beat me at hide and seek.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Four!

10:40.701 --> 10:42.671
I was looking for her for hours.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.950
When I finally found her...

10:45.728 --> 10:46.976
she just smiled.

10:48.179 --> 10:49.520
You know that Effy smile?

10:50.724 --> 10:51.811
That means...

10:52.596 --> 10:54.000
"You don't know me at all.

10:55.415 --> 10:56.842
"And you never will."

10:58.084 --> 11:00.000
See, that's a kind of magic.

11:03.226 --> 11:06.014
She's so good
at concealing things and...

11:06.699 --> 11:07.699
hiding,

11:08.191 --> 11:09.191
avoiding.

11:11.878 --> 11:13.672
But I do know her.

11:16.536 --> 11:20.369
And I know that she has got
so much love in her heart...

11:22.353 --> 11:25.226
that the thought of...
letting it out,

11:26.287 --> 11:27.686
showing her cards...

11:29.224 --> 11:30.745
it scares her to death.

11:36.108 --> 11:38.324
I never knew it would be possible

11:39.224 --> 11:41.184
to miss someone this much.

11:56.494 --> 11:59.600
Go on, Dad! Come on, all the way!
All the way, Dad!

12:03.520 --> 12:04.724
Go on, Dad!

12:05.072 --> 12:06.859
Excellent. Piece of piss.

12:06.979 --> 12:07.979
Have that!

12:09.590 --> 12:10.800
He's done most of it.

12:11.951 --> 12:13.600
Don't be a twat, give him his prize.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.720
The whole jar, we said.

12:18.721 --> 12:19.721
All right.

12:28.712 --> 12:30.187
Nice. Ease you in.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.975
There she goes.

12:34.869 --> 12:36.164
Get in!

12:50.960 --> 12:54.306
There you go.
One half-pint of bitter,

12:54.426 --> 12:56.394
you sad little man.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.861
Right! Time!

12:59.158 --> 13:02.332
Everyone either head down the club
or fuck off home!

13:02.452 --> 13:04.337
I'm gonna have to neck it now.

13:39.064 --> 13:40.520
How about that, boys?

13:43.492 --> 13:44.492
All right?

13:46.077 --> 13:47.040
What you doin'?

13:48.541 --> 13:49.360
Not sure.

13:52.004 --> 13:53.200
What you doin' tomorrow?

13:54.897 --> 13:57.445
It's the solstice steeplechase.
Come down and watch.

13:57.565 --> 13:59.332
- The what?
- It's a race.

13:59.452 --> 14:00.957
Old village tradition.

14:01.077 --> 14:03.080
I'm champion, three years running.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.320
- Aren't I, lads?
- Whoop-de-do.

14:08.068 --> 14:10.120
You know, if you were my girl,

14:10.979 --> 14:13.044
I wouldn't let you out of my sight.

14:15.616 --> 14:17.723
I'd handcuff you to the bed an' all.

14:22.545 --> 14:25.254
- Those things'll kill you, you know.
- Hadn't heard.

14:25.628 --> 14:26.778
That's funny,

14:27.198 --> 14:29.072
You can put it on your tombstone.

14:29.765 --> 14:31.558
So, what, you don't smoke?

14:31.858 --> 14:32.640
Drink?

14:34.092 --> 14:35.393
Nothing?

14:35.513 --> 14:36.888
We're straight-edge.

14:41.736 --> 14:43.915
I don't let the pressure
crush me up.

14:44.518 --> 14:46.160
You've got to look after yourself.

14:46.762 --> 14:47.920
Know what I mean?

15:02.658 --> 15:05.440
Come on. We're going clubbin'.
You, me and Dad.

15:07.278 --> 15:09.160
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

15:10.149 --> 15:11.960
Let's just go, now.

15:14.086 --> 15:16.266
Listen, there's nowhere else to go.

15:16.839 --> 15:17.889
This is it.

15:19.605 --> 15:21.324
And it's fucking brilliant!

15:22.603 --> 15:24.724
Come on, let's go get fucked up.

15:54.084 --> 15:55.732
So what d'you think of her, then?

15:55.852 --> 15:56.852
Very tidy.

15:57.977 --> 15:58.880
Nice pins,

15:59.270 --> 16:00.370
quality tits

16:00.680 --> 16:04.080
and an arse like two snooker balls
in a sock. Marvellous!

16:05.959 --> 16:08.059
I'd ride that to hell and back.

16:09.674 --> 16:12.746
Looks like I'll have to get
in the fucking queue, though.

16:12.866 --> 16:14.880
No, I'm gonna keep her, you know.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.324
She's mine.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.320
No cunt's taking her away from me.

16:22.058 --> 16:24.997
I reckon some cunt already did.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.600
What? You fucking prick!

17:15.045 --> 17:15.839
Full moon.

17:22.752 --> 17:25.226
When the full moon rises...

17:26.162 --> 17:27.162
gods

17:27.448 --> 17:29.080
and monsters will come out to play.

17:36.845 --> 17:38.345
So how does it feel?

17:39.637 --> 17:41.080
To have everyone want you?

17:43.795 --> 17:46.356
That Donny's desperate
to get into your pants.

17:48.916 --> 17:50.249
Are you gonna let him?

17:59.173 --> 18:00.373
What about me?

18:02.034 --> 18:04.001
You gonna let me into your pants?

18:07.566 --> 18:09.516
Too pretty for your own good.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.668
That's why you destroy
everything you touch.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.794
Look who's talking.

18:16.693 --> 18:18.393
I'm Guns N' Roses, love.

18:19.004 --> 18:20.600
I've got an appetite
for destruction.

18:21.693 --> 18:23.143
You're not his dad.

18:23.565 --> 18:24.615
Not really.

18:25.008 --> 18:27.008
And you're not his girlfriend.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.504
Not really.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.640
You're gonna fucking snap
that boy's heart in two.

18:31.908 --> 18:34.880
And you've been doing it to him
every day of his life.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.147
Where do you think you're going?

18:42.267 --> 18:43.267
Nowhere.

19:44.315 --> 19:45.315
JJ's here.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.064
Sorry, it's just...

19:53.184 --> 19:55.630
Facebook really needs
to hear about this.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.297
- I wanted to say something.
- Maybe I'll turn this off first, yeah?

20:08.617 --> 20:09.967
You can look now.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.387
- So what's up? I thought you'd quit.
- I can't quit.

20:13.507 --> 20:14.677
You can't quit.

20:15.332 --> 20:16.582
None of us can.

20:16.943 --> 20:19.335
We're still the Musketeers.
We do stuff.

20:20.085 --> 20:22.720
- What are we supposed to do?
- We're supposed to find them.

20:22.880 --> 20:26.200
- We're supposed to sort this mess out.
- There's nothing to sort out.

20:26.844 --> 20:27.844
Really?

20:36.287 --> 20:37.787
What is this number?

20:46.833 --> 20:47.933
Who is this?

20:50.530 --> 20:51.822
Cook's in trouble.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.618
He needs your help.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.887
<i>You need to come get him, right?</i>

20:59.606 --> 21:01.107
Why can't you help him?

21:03.733 --> 21:05.183
Because I love you.

22:03.988 --> 22:05.138
Where's Effy?

22:09.928 --> 22:10.928
No idea.

22:12.090 --> 22:14.010
She must have fucked off
{\sometime }during the night.

22:14.130 --> 22:15.130
What?

22:17.772 --> 22:19.633
Probably jealous of you and me.

22:23.745 --> 22:26.361
- We've got to find her.
- Never mind, she'll be back.

22:26.918 --> 22:28.131
How do you know?

22:31.932 --> 22:33.455
She's in a small town,

22:33.912 --> 22:36.585
she's got fuck-all money
and she's got no car.

22:36.705 --> 22:38.850
Anyway, fanny's fanny.

22:39.614 --> 22:40.890
Family's family.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.812
I've got an idea that's going to
take this town by fucking storm.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.178
But I need you with me 100%. Yeah?

22:57.323 --> 23:00.107
- Right, when we get in there...
- You do the talking.

23:00.574 --> 23:03.200
- Great minds, son. Great minds.
- Yeah, Dad.

23:05.837 --> 23:08.237
- I've missed "Dad".
- Fuck off, Dad!

23:16.895 --> 23:18.845
Place looks cracking, Donald.

23:19.052 --> 23:21.794
What time's Binkie the Clown
serving up jelly and ice cream?

23:21.914 --> 23:25.080
Piss off, you. You're never getting
a drink in here, ever.

23:25.728 --> 23:27.191
Fucking hell, Donald.

23:27.311 --> 23:29.856
Your customer service has gone
right out the window.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.749
They'd never stand
for that in the States.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.726
You want to sod off to America,
Cook, be my guest.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.400
I'll even buy your ticket.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.044
But if I left, Donald,
I'd never be able to pay off me debt.

23:41.164 --> 23:43.464
How are you ever gonna pay me back?

23:45.397 --> 23:46.520
Little wager.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.360
Wonderful. Do tell.

23:49.038 --> 23:50.200
My boy here...

23:52.090 --> 23:53.560
is gonna enter your steeplechase.

23:58.040 --> 23:58.916
That...

23:59.439 --> 24:00.439
is...

24:00.855 --> 24:01.720
good news.

24:02.254 --> 24:05.754
No-one was even bothering
to enter against Donny this year.

24:07.862 --> 24:09.012
Fucking hell!

24:09.917 --> 24:12.337
- What's the bet?
- If my boy wins,

24:12.896 --> 24:16.546
you drop the debt, like Bono wants
for them starving Africans.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.990
Fine. But if...

24:19.664 --> 24:20.479
he...

24:20.599 --> 24:21.599
loses...

24:29.289 --> 24:31.280
I get your boat

24:32.342 --> 24:33.407
and you...

24:33.921 --> 24:35.800
fuck off out of town.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.080
You're fucking on.

24:43.964 --> 24:45.240
Beat you later, then.

24:53.115 --> 24:54.415
What a shithole.

24:54.940 --> 24:56.582
This was the area code.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.780
So what do you reckon?

25:14.480 --> 25:15.530
Shall we...

25:15.650 --> 25:18.438
have a look around town, do you think,
try and find that phone box?

25:18.558 --> 25:19.935
No, we'll stay here.

25:21.615 --> 25:24.920
- How do you know they'll be here?
- They're coming. OK? They have to.

26:26.304 --> 26:28.454
What the fuck are you doing here?

26:29.334 --> 26:31.320
What the fuck are you doing here?

26:31.777 --> 26:35.160
- We thought you might be in trouble.
- Do I look like I'm in trouble?

26:38.379 --> 26:40.214
I'm 10 times better
than you've ever been,

26:40.334 --> 26:42.520
you pair of miserable,
boring shites.

26:46.956 --> 26:48.106
Where is she?

26:48.573 --> 26:50.575
Right.
That's why you came.

26:51.814 --> 26:55.258
Fucking hell. You don't know
when you're fucking beat, do you?

26:55.440 --> 26:58.040
- Guys, this isn't how it's supposed...
- How did you find me?

27:06.753 --> 27:09.280
She called him.
But... just stop this, right?

27:09.440 --> 27:10.584
Listen to me, please.

27:10.704 --> 27:12.754
- JJ, stop it.
- Fuck off, JJ.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
OK, then.

27:14.810 --> 27:17.795
You know, flipping...
flip the both of you, then. Fuck-turds!

27:20.753 --> 27:22.395
- Enter the race.
- You what?

27:22.515 --> 27:23.633
Enter the race.

27:23.753 --> 27:26.200
The winner gets to keep her.
For ever.

27:27.242 --> 27:29.136
- You're a child.
- You're a pussy.

27:29.704 --> 27:32.525
- Come on, let's fucking settle this.
- In a race?

27:33.649 --> 27:35.203
You got any other ideas?

27:39.007 --> 27:40.557
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

27:41.368 --> 27:44.800
<i>welcome to the annual
solstice steeplechase.</i>

27:47.930 --> 27:49.440
<i>From time immemorial,</i>

27:49.681 --> 27:52.599
<i>this race has typified
the spirit of our town,</i>

27:53.118 --> 27:54.840
<i>tough, uncompromising,</i>

27:55.673 --> 27:56.673
<i>hard.</i>

27:56.869 --> 28:00.517
<i>Many have attempted the challenge.
Few have succeeded.</i>

28:01.235 --> 28:02.622
<i>It's winner-takes-all...</i>

28:02.742 --> 28:04.928
- You do it.
- He might be, Cook.

28:05.548 --> 28:08.107
<i>Allow me to introduce
the reigning champion,</i>

28:08.227 --> 28:10.746
<i>my son, Donny Donaldson.</i>

28:24.159 --> 28:25.609
Who's that bellend?

28:27.105 --> 28:29.080
<i>Not since the first time,</i>

28:29.240 --> 28:32.800
<i>since Kriss Akabusi graced us
with his presence,</i>

28:32.960 --> 28:35.466
<i>we have outsiders in the race,</i>

28:35.586 --> 28:37.686
<i>so I'd better explain the rules.</i>

28:38.055 --> 28:41.505
<i>Once round the village.
First one back here is the winner.</i>

28:42.120 --> 28:43.640
<i>And if you drop your elder,</i>

28:43.800 --> 28:47.040
<i>you're out, and, we give you
a bit of a shoeing, lads.</i>

29:02.714 --> 29:04.415
<i>Elders, assemble.</i>

29:13.316 --> 29:15.666
<i>Choose your riders.</i>

29:19.739 --> 29:21.160
<i>Elders, mount.</i>

29:23.598 --> 29:24.560
<i>On your marks...</i>

29:25.634 --> 29:26.634
<i>set...</i>

29:27.557 --> 29:28.557
<i>go!</i>

29:36.928 --> 29:40.228
I think I'll chop up your boat
and use it for firewood.

29:41.912 --> 29:43.200
Come on, son!

29:44.084 --> 29:46.552
<i>Come on, Donny! Away, man!</i>

30:27.120 --> 30:28.240
You dropped her!

30:28.635 --> 30:29.635
Fuck you!

30:30.992 --> 30:33.845
- Why did you stop, mate?
- He fucking elbowed me.

30:33.965 --> 30:34.965
So?

30:35.899 --> 30:37.600
- That's not fair, is it?
- Fair?

30:38.093 --> 30:39.746
What do you think this is?

30:39.866 --> 30:41.016
Enid Blyton?

31:12.140 --> 31:15.053
- <i>Come on, son!</i>
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

31:17.671 --> 31:18.671
Come on!

31:44.509 --> 31:46.124
You twat!

31:50.271 --> 31:51.620
Crap, you were.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.279
This is my race!

32:07.577 --> 32:08.733
Mine!

32:20.522 --> 32:23.470
Tell your dad
that I'll be there in the morning

32:23.590 --> 32:25.699
to collect me winnings.

32:32.714 --> 32:33.930
Fucking dick!

32:34.735 --> 32:37.680
You've lost my dad's boat, Effy...
I've got fuck all now, you...

32:39.680 --> 32:41.546
This is the wushu finger hold.

32:41.666 --> 32:43.800
I learnt it in a book.
Of a film.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.087
J, let's just leave it now...

32:47.080 --> 32:49.823
I'm pretty sure if I apply
the correct pressure, your eyes pop out.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.049
J, my eyes aren't gonna pop out.

32:52.866 --> 32:54.765
Do you really want
to take that chance?

33:02.499 --> 33:05.151
Let's not air our dirty
laundry in public, boys.

33:06.428 --> 33:07.428
You, too.

33:12.671 --> 33:13.940
Not you, loser.

33:19.786 --> 33:21.160
Take a seat, Ef.

33:22.230 --> 33:23.160
JJ, mate...

33:25.259 --> 33:26.911
Now, let's get down to it.

33:27.234 --> 33:28.520
No more evasion.

33:28.848 --> 33:31.673
No more,
"Ooh, I'm so fit and mysterious."

33:32.131 --> 33:33.131
Now,

33:33.327 --> 33:35.280
Freddie he's in love with you.

33:35.974 --> 33:37.369
Aren't you, Freddie?

33:38.480 --> 33:40.000
Aren't you, Freddie?

33:40.379 --> 33:41.417
And Cook,

33:41.537 --> 33:42.886
he loves you, yes?

33:46.108 --> 33:48.482
And just for the record,
I love you, too.

33:48.691 --> 33:50.634
Plus... I won the race.

33:52.051 --> 33:54.466
So, three boys, one girl.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.560
It's an insoluble equation,
unless you choose.

33:59.321 --> 34:01.770
Then we can finally
get back to our lives.

34:14.281 --> 34:18.078
Fuck all of you.
Your Prince Charming made a bet on you

34:19.480 --> 34:22.014
said whoever wins the race
gets to keep you. Classy?

34:22.135 --> 34:23.900
Effy, I didn't know.
Cook, stay.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.688
No, I'm not living
on my fucking knees any more.

34:26.809 --> 34:28.440
Cook, we can solve this.

34:29.405 --> 34:31.013
Stay here you two.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.109
What did you expect?

34:45.375 --> 34:47.085
You made this a game first.

34:48.472 --> 34:50.484
Remember that stupid fucking list?

34:52.717 --> 34:54.005
You made this happen.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.320
And it's all your fault
this is all so fucked up.

34:57.291 --> 34:58.809
- I know.
- You know?

34:59.113 --> 35:01.164
What sort of fucking answer's that?

35:01.563 --> 35:02.960
The only one I've got.

35:21.807 --> 35:23.098
You all think...

35:23.668 --> 35:27.105
You all think that I'm scum
that you're better than me,

35:28.001 --> 35:29.840
that you're better than my dad.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.148
I'm not better than your dad.

35:33.268 --> 35:34.268
You are.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.960
You're better than someone who runs away
from the people who love them.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.160
Who need them.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.729
Fuck off, man. You daft boon!

35:45.941 --> 35:48.520
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to drink myself to death.

35:49.166 --> 35:52.527
Then I'm going to say sorry to me dad.
Then life finally begins.

37:21.534 --> 37:25.047
I thought we was gonna take
this town by storm, you and me.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.242
I'm not letting
that twat take my boat.

37:28.603 --> 37:30.120
Can't I just come with you, then?

37:33.427 --> 37:35.516
Look, I didn't ask for this.

37:37.566 --> 37:41.320
I didn't ask you to turn up here.
There's no fucking space.

37:57.690 --> 38:00.272
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me the keys.

38:05.462 --> 38:07.494
Let me tell you something, James.

38:09.639 --> 38:12.569
I never fucking wanted you
in the first place.

38:17.054 --> 38:19.814
So give me the keys
and get off the fucking boat.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.840
Give me the fucking keys!

38:53.277 --> 38:57.053
Now, give Daddy the keys,
or I'm gonna melt your fucking face off!

39:00.072 --> 39:02.720
Be sensible, son.
I'll fucking do it.

39:03.325 --> 39:04.654
I'll fucking do it!

39:05.546 --> 39:06.960
I don't give a fuck.

39:08.112 --> 39:09.346
I don't, either.

39:28.697 --> 39:29.760
This is bad.

39:31.697 --> 39:32.697
Fuck!

39:35.923 --> 39:37.339
Cook, are you all right?

39:40.347 --> 39:41.760
He didn't mean it.

39:42.656 --> 39:46.400
What's the fucking difference?
Nothing good ever stays with me.

39:47.262 --> 39:48.629
Absolutely nothing.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.600
You've got me.

40:10.054 --> 40:12.509
I can't believe
we just went granny racing.

40:19.531 --> 40:21.440
I had it all planned out, man.

40:21.866 --> 40:23.510
Get a boat of our own,

40:24.373 --> 40:25.835
moor it down here,

40:26.360 --> 40:27.360
a job,

40:27.567 --> 40:28.574
everything.

40:30.878 --> 40:33.081
- But she doesn't love me.
- She does.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.888
- I know she does.
- She loves you better.

40:40.022 --> 40:42.528
I was with her last night.
Do you understand?

40:47.529 --> 40:49.997
So you know
what I've come here to ask you.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.950
Cook, please...

40:56.412 --> 40:57.988
Please just say it's OK.

41:02.288 --> 41:03.288
I can't.

41:06.143 --> 41:07.339
I just can't.

41:09.310 --> 41:11.840
I'm sorry. I just fucking love her.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.080
I'm sorry.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.960
- I fucking love her.
- But we can't share, can we?

41:38.091 --> 41:39.648
Right, there you are.

41:40.889 --> 41:41.760
What's up?

41:45.116 --> 41:46.920
On balance, I'd say he was alive.

41:47.632 --> 41:48.600
Great.

41:51.548 --> 41:53.039
Should we like tie him up?

41:54.253 --> 41:57.258
A bump to the head like that, you don't
want to interrupt the blood flow.

41:57.378 --> 41:58.360
I dunno, J.

41:59.485 --> 42:01.160
Right, we'll dump him later.

42:01.428 --> 42:02.970
Everyone wrap up warm.

42:05.707 --> 42:07.026
What are you doing?

42:08.430 --> 42:10.017
"We" are going home.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.240
We can't nick the boat,
this is ridiculous.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.720
This is 17 years worth
of birthday and Christmas presents.

42:23.058 --> 42:25.710
Cook, start the engine, please.
We need to leave quite quickly.

42:25.830 --> 42:27.400
- Why?
- Too late.

42:27.560 --> 42:29.200
- Look.
- Get out of my boat!

42:31.400 --> 42:33.347
Get on the boat. Go, go.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.400
- Get that engine started, OK?
- Hurry up, Fred.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.880
Help me push it out.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.040
Hurry up!

42:39.880 --> 42:41.280
Get out of my boat!

42:41.400 --> 42:44.250
- Get it started. Come on!
- JJ, help him, will you?

42:44.370 --> 42:45.480
Wanker!

43:03.192 --> 43:04.198
Wankers!

43:09.480 --> 43:11.640
It's all right, you little fucks.

43:13.543 --> 43:14.543
Wankers!

43:16.613 --> 43:19.328
You shit, I'll find you!
I'll find you!

43:23.621 --> 43:24.640
Fuck you!

43:25.595 --> 43:27.766
I'm Cook, you shithead!

43:28.062 --> 43:29.150
I'm Cook!

43:33.309 --> 43:34.320
Come here.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.240
I knew you wouldn't
let me down, son.

43:41.691 --> 43:44.120
I'm Cook, you fuckers!

43:44.280 --> 43:45.435
Cook!

43:47.376 --> 43:48.617
I'm Cook.

43:49.887 --> 43:52.120
Fuck you! Fuck you!

43:53.960 --> 43:54.960
Fuck you!

45:31.496 --> 45:32.160
So...
