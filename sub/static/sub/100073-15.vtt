WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:01.500
Dispatch:
All units, be on the lookout

00:01.520 --> 00:03.260
for eight prostitutes
in lingerie,

00:03.270 --> 00:05.556
fighting near Park La Brea.
At 10:00 a.m.?

00:05.580 --> 00:07.646
Yeah, you know, sometimes
you just got to get it in.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.006
Want to take the call?
Hell no.

00:09.030 --> 00:10.650
Those ladies
will take an eye out.

00:13.670 --> 00:15.040
Check it out...
2:00, knit cap.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.766
Call it in.
Control, 7-Adam-15.

00:18.790 --> 00:20.356
211 in progress, Circus Liquor,

00:20.380 --> 00:21.896
requesting backup.

00:25.580 --> 00:26.670
Ready?

00:28.080 --> 00:29.556
Drop the gun!
LAPD!

00:29.580 --> 00:30.896
Don't shoot!
It... It's just a movie!

00:30.920 --> 00:32.055
No, don't...
Don't look at camera.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.686
This is great production value.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.430
What the... Okay,
arrest him like it's real.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.356
Oh, no! Uh, tase him.

00:37.380 --> 00:38.670
What?
Make it really hurt.

00:39.580 --> 00:40.726
Fake gun.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.056
Of course it is.
I'm a film major.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.396
This is my thesis project.

00:43.420 --> 00:45.306
Okay, well, you almost
got your actor killed.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.806
Do you have a permit to
film here, one that would have

00:47.830 --> 00:51.016
notified law enforcement
of your use of prop firearms?

00:51.040 --> 00:53.976
No, I... I'm just a student.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.436
That doesn't matter.

00:55.460 --> 00:56.646
You've just committed
a misdemeanor

00:56.670 --> 00:57.976
punishable by up to
a year in jail

00:58.000 --> 00:59.266
or a $10,000 fine.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.146
Your driver's license, please.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.226
Beaver.

01:06.250 --> 01:07.856
What kind of weird-ass movie
is this?

01:21.330 --> 01:22.766
Morning, sir.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.016
Good morning. You ready
to go?

01:24.040 --> 01:26.120
As I'll ever be.
You?

01:28.210 --> 01:30.146
We'll head out
right after roll call.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.080
See you in there.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.356
Yo, you should've come out
with us last night.

01:37.380 --> 01:38.976
We hit this barista jam
down in the Arts District.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.266
A what?

01:40.290 --> 01:41.396
Yeah, uh, celebrity baristi

01:41.420 --> 01:42.726
pull espresso shots
from artisanal beans,

01:42.750 --> 01:43.647
whip up latte art.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.356
It's total fire.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.726
Okay, I know all those words
separately, but together...

01:47.750 --> 01:49.806
Oh, then we jammed with this
Cowpunk band till like 4:00 a.m.,

01:49.830 --> 01:51.726
then went to Venice Beach
to watch the sunrise.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.266
Okay, you have a singular way of
making me feel

01:54.290 --> 01:55.976
A thousand years old.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.646
Sorry.
Hang on one second.

01:57.670 --> 01:59.750
Yo! This is he.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.146
What?

02:03.170 --> 02:05.226
Well, there must be
some mistake.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.266
No, um, I will look into
that today. Thank you.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.395
I'm so sorry about that.
Thank you.

02:09.419 --> 02:10.936
What?

02:10.960 --> 02:13.016
Uh, my tuition payment
for Henry's college

02:13.040 --> 02:14.686
didn't go through...
Insufficient funds.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.186
I thought you had his whole
four years squirreled away.

02:16.210 --> 02:19.186
I do. It's... I'm sure
it's just a mistake.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.766
Okay, before
you hit the street today,

02:22.790 --> 02:24.226
a few orders of business.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.436
One of my duties as Sergeant

02:26.460 --> 02:29.396
is to run periodic assessments
on officers under my command

02:29.420 --> 02:32.186
to ensure that the duty manual
is being followed

02:32.210 --> 02:35.306
and that, personally,
you are all above reproach.

02:35.330 --> 02:36.770
Then I hope
you didn't read my diary.

02:38.210 --> 02:40.056
Uh, what exactly
is being assessed?

02:40.080 --> 02:41.396
Occupational integrity.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.976
From how we maintain
our equipment

02:43.000 --> 02:44.396
to the upkeep of all
of our certifications.

02:44.420 --> 02:46.356
If we can't obey every rule,

02:46.380 --> 02:47.396
how can we expect that
from citizens?

02:47.420 --> 02:49.356
Exactly.

02:49.380 --> 02:52.856
This is a list
of all minor deficiencies.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.226
Officer West will be in charge

02:54.250 --> 02:55.806
of sharing those infractions
with you

02:55.830 --> 02:57.556
and making sure this station
is in compliance

02:57.580 --> 02:58.976
with all regulations.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.436
So I won't be riding
with Officer Lopez today, sir?

03:01.460 --> 03:02.806
No, she and I
will be out of the station

03:02.830 --> 03:04.226
for the rest of the day.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.686
So, that being said,

03:05.710 --> 03:07.726
Sergeant Roberts
from Pacific Division

03:07.750 --> 03:08.896
will be filling in.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.146
I expect to hear good things.

03:10.170 --> 03:11.476
That's it.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.080
Officer Nolan, a word, please.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.556
Nolan:
Yes, sir? Any problem?

03:16.580 --> 03:18.146
I didn't want to say this
in front of everyone,

03:18.170 --> 03:20.096
but your credit score's
been red-flagged.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.806
A credit risk is 620.

03:21.830 --> 03:22.896
You're at 300.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.266
That's impossible.

03:24.290 --> 03:25.476
I check my credit score
every six months.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.936
I've never been below 700.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.056
Well, it's under it now.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.936
A cop in financial trouble

03:29.960 --> 03:31.726
is susceptible to bad actions.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.646
If you don't raise your score
to acceptable standards ASAP,

03:34.670 --> 03:36.096
they will cut you
from the program.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.250
Yes, sir. I'll fix it.
Good.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.936
First, Henry's tuition bounces.
Now this?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.806
Something's really wrong.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.146
Man: Here you go.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.646
So, are you nervous
about meeting Rachel's dad?

03:48.670 --> 03:49.766
Please.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.356
It's got to be
a tick nerve-racking.

03:51.380 --> 03:52.806
Rachel adores her dad.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.186
And he's gonna love me.

03:54.210 --> 03:56.056
Colin was a sheriff
for 30 years.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.186
Yeah, in a town
with two stop lights.

03:58.210 --> 04:00.766
L.A. or Mayberry,
a cop's a cop.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.856
Oh, no, he's from Sweet Home,
not Mayberry.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.396
No, I-I know. It's...

04:04.420 --> 04:06.596
Mayberry, like, the TV show?

04:06.620 --> 04:08.726
What TV show?
Never mind.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.686
Hey, where are
Lopez and Grey going?

04:10.710 --> 04:12.596
Lompoc Prison.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.936
Guy who shot Grey and killed
his partner is up for parole.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.096
Parole?
But he killed a cop.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.516
It's been 10 years.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.016
Must've gotten credit
for good behavior.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.146
I doubt they'll release him.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.266
Why is Lopez going?

04:22.290 --> 04:25.226
Lopez and her T.O.
were first on scene.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.556
Officer Rowland
died in her arms.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.016
That's awful.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.186
10 years ago,
Lopez would've been a rookie.

04:31.210 --> 04:33.080
It was her first shift.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.146
We'll get there in two hours
if you heavy-foot it.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.896
So, I cleared the way
with local law

04:38.920 --> 04:41.556
so they don't sweat a
black-and-white blur on the interstate.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.686
Well, we won't need to
stop for food.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.686
Turkey jerky.
Gummy bears.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.356
And breath mints.

04:47.380 --> 04:48.896
The Advocate Group
send that over?

04:48.920 --> 04:50.596
Yep.
Victim Emergency Bags.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.146
Everything a survivor needs to
get through the stages of grief.

04:53.170 --> 04:54.686
I appreciate the thought,

04:54.710 --> 04:57.766
but I went through all
those stages a long time ago.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.540
Feels like yesterday.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.856
That it does.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.686
You speak with Christine?

05:04.710 --> 05:09.856
Yeah. Yeah, um, last night.
She's not going.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.556
We'll have to
speak on the widow's behalf.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.436
You ready?

05:14.460 --> 05:15.806
Yep.

05:17.620 --> 05:19.976
Nolan: No. No, no, no.
This is a nightmare.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.436
I only carry one credit card.

05:21.460 --> 05:23.396
My credit report says
I have seven.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.226
Someone obviously
stole my identity

05:25.250 --> 05:26.266
and opened cards in my name.

05:26.290 --> 05:28.436
And ran up big balances.

05:28.460 --> 05:29.936
And they emptied
Henry's college account.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.146
How am I gonna fix this?

05:31.170 --> 05:33.016
Detective Summerland,
Identify Theft Division.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.056
He'll know what to do.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.766
Alrighty. Here we go.

05:36.790 --> 05:38.436
Now, first thing we got to do
is super important.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.186
We got to separate
all the legitimate charges

05:40.210 --> 05:42.226
from the illegitimate charges,
alright?

05:42.250 --> 05:44.016
So, we're gonna
need one of these...

05:44.040 --> 05:46.016
Let's see.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.936
Looks like you spent $19,000,

05:49.960 --> 05:52.266
uh, for an ocelot coat?

05:52.290 --> 05:53.646
I'm sorry.
What is an ocelot again?

05:53.670 --> 05:55.306
Something that would like
its fur back.

05:55.330 --> 05:57.806
That's... No.
Okay, okay.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.476
So, I think we all agree
that charge

05:59.500 --> 06:01.896
is pretty gosh darn
illegitimate, right?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.556
Okay.

06:03.580 --> 06:07.856
Looks like you also paid $15,000
for tennis shoes.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.226
$15,000?

06:09.250 --> 06:10.476
Do they come with a car?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.266
Okay, look,
none of those charges

06:13.290 --> 06:15.056
on those six cards are mine,

06:15.080 --> 06:16.936
but the college account is,
and it's been emptied.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.856
How long will it take for the
bank to put that money back?

06:18.880 --> 06:20.596
Uh, yeah,

06:20.620 --> 06:22.556
so the... the bank,

06:22.580 --> 06:25.686
um, they... will not
give you your money back,

06:25.710 --> 06:27.146
because you only have 60 days

06:27.170 --> 06:28.686
to notify them
of fraudulent activity,

06:28.710 --> 06:31.516
and if you don't,
then no way, Jose,

06:31.540 --> 06:32.766
are they on the hook.

06:32.790 --> 06:35.096
And they probably made
that "clear" to you

06:35.120 --> 06:37.766
in, like,
criminally small print, so...

06:37.790 --> 06:39.596
I only check the account
once a semester

06:39.620 --> 06:40.936
when I make the payment.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.726
Okay, well,
what about Nolan's credit?

06:42.750 --> 06:44.226
Because if we can't
get that sorted,

06:44.250 --> 06:46.556
he is out
of the F.T.O. program.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.976
10-4.
I got you guys covered.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.936
I will have a gorgeous
case file for you

06:49.960 --> 06:51.396
by end of business,

06:51.420 --> 06:54.096
and the case file should be
enough for the LAPD, so...

06:54.120 --> 06:55.936
Okay, well, that's good news.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.056
Henry's gonna get
kicked out of the school

06:57.080 --> 06:58.186
if they don't get that money.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.856
Okay, let's...
Let's not go that far.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.306
We just need to find
the guy who stole it.

07:01.330 --> 07:03.516
Actually, when you do
nab your man,

07:03.540 --> 07:05.356
you will still need
to persuade the court

07:05.380 --> 07:07.976
to force him
to make restitution, so...

07:08.000 --> 07:09.356
How long will that take?

07:09.380 --> 07:12.226
Oh, just three years.
Five years, tops.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.396
Five years?
No, no, sorry.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.936
Uh, what I should say is
it will be three to five years

07:16.960 --> 07:18.976
unless the thief happens
to be overseas,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.170
in which case it'll be
more like never.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.516
Wait a minute.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.016
He bought an Allenbach.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.306
Does that have fur, too?

07:28.330 --> 07:29.476
No, better.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.856
It has GPS.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.056
It's a watch, and I am betting

07:32.080 --> 07:34.096
our thief is wearing that
right now.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.396
So, have you decided where
you're taking Rachel's dad for dinner?

07:37.420 --> 07:39.516
I mean, too fancy, and he'll
think you're a showoff.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.436
But he is from out of town,

07:41.460 --> 07:43.766
so you got to deliver
a celebrity sighting.

07:43.790 --> 07:46.806
We have a reservation
for 7:00 p.m. at The Smokehouse.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.726
Ooh. Old school.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.016
I like it.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.516
Oh, Rach.
We were just talking about you.

07:53.540 --> 07:56.016
That's... That's awful.
Yeah, we're on it.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.186
We'll... We'll be right there.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.476
Somebody broke
into her father's car

07:58.500 --> 08:00.146
and stole his suitcase.

08:00.170 --> 08:01.306
And you told her we'd handle it?

08:01.330 --> 08:03.556
Come on.
You know?

08:03.580 --> 08:04.726
This is a great
opportunity to bond.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.356
You just put
your best foot forward.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.936
Auto burglary cases
have a .02% solve rate.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.516
How is failing to recover
her dad's suitcase

08:10.540 --> 08:13.646
my best foot forward?

08:13.670 --> 08:16.726
Smokehouse.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.040
I love their bread.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.476
Hey. Smitty.
Got a sec?

08:21.500 --> 08:22.646
Not exactly.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.016
This comes
straight from the Sarge.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.476
What?
I need you to check

08:25.500 --> 08:26.726
the expiration date
of your pepper spray.

08:26.750 --> 08:29.096
They have expiration dates?
Yes.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.436
And the compliance audit
listed you

08:30.460 --> 08:31.936
as having outdated OC spray.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.186
"Good through
October 2014."

08:34.210 --> 08:35.645
Yeah, I'mma need you
to change that out.

08:35.669 --> 08:38.096
Bet it still works.
You want to see?

08:40.080 --> 08:42.265
Smitty.
Kit room's that way.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.356
Records show you haven't
qualified with your assault rifle in...

08:46.710 --> 08:47.870
Looks like it's been about...

08:49.120 --> 08:51.266
Look, i-if you're not
in Motors anymore,

08:51.290 --> 08:52.856
you have to return
the motorcycle.

08:52.880 --> 08:53.976
And y...

08:55.580 --> 08:56.596
And the helmet!

08:56.620 --> 08:58.016
Okay, it's simple.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.646
Drink a cup of coffee,
put a buck in the jar.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.356
Cup, buck.
Cup, buck. Cup, buck.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.556
Cup, buck.

09:04.581 --> 09:05.806
Okay, look.

09:05.830 --> 09:08.056
Just, um, put this 10 bucks
in the jar, please.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.266
Thanks for coming.

09:15.290 --> 09:16.726
Look at you in that uniform.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.596
It's so good to see you
again. Yeah.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.646
Shoot.

09:19.670 --> 09:20.726
Tim Bradford.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.000
Colin Hall.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.516
It's a pleasure to meet you,
sir.

09:30.540 --> 09:31.896
Sorry your trip got off
to a rough start.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.596
Ah, it was my own fault.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.596
I saw a guy eyeing the car
as I parked,

09:35.620 --> 09:36.557
but I was in a hurry.

09:36.581 --> 09:38.016
Good news is

09:38.040 --> 09:39.556
I could recognize him
if I saw him again.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.056
Well, unfortunately, we have

09:41.080 --> 09:42.936
17,000 auto burglaries
in L.A. each year,

09:42.960 --> 09:44.646
so the odds of us
finding the guy...

09:44.670 --> 09:46.726
You know, back in Sweet Home,
a good street cop

09:46.750 --> 09:48.016
would know every crook
in his beat.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.766
We call it
"beat integrity."

09:49.790 --> 09:52.516
Well, much easier
in a town with nine criminals.

09:52.540 --> 09:55.146
Okay, Dad, we really just need
to get a claim number

09:55.170 --> 09:56.516
for the insurance report.

09:56.540 --> 09:57.856
You know,
maybe I'll drive around

09:57.880 --> 09:59.686
and see if I can't
crack the case for you.

09:59.710 --> 10:00.896
Uh, Dad... You know what, sir?

10:00.920 --> 10:02.396
Why don't you climb in the shop?

10:02.420 --> 10:03.896
We'll drive around,
do some hunting.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.806
See if we get lucky.

10:05.830 --> 10:07.856
If you insist.
Alright. Come on.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.120
You should sit in the front,
sir.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.146
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10:14.170 --> 10:16.896
I have to get back to work,
but I owe you.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.960
Okay.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.266
I know.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.806
But try and stay positive, okay?

10:30.080 --> 10:33.226
I had no idea
some watches had GPS.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.476
Allenbachs were originally
designed for fighter pilots

10:35.500 --> 10:38.516
in case they got shot down...
Help rescuers find them.

10:38.540 --> 10:40.306
Dispatch: 7-Adam-15,

10:40.330 --> 10:42.396
I have a records match
for the address you called in.

10:42.420 --> 10:44.476
House belongs to Jordan Neil,

10:44.500 --> 10:46.726
43 years old,
no criminal history.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.540
That's about to change.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.356
Nice to see he's spending
my money wisely.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.396
He's gonna run.
He's getting away.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.556
No, he's not.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.186
Aah!

11:18.210 --> 11:19.266
You're under arrest.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.450
How the hell did you find me?

11:22.540 --> 11:25.776
You stole the identities
of over 40 people.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.106
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:27.130 --> 11:28.107
And do you mind
taking these off?

11:28.131 --> 11:29.356
You're scratching
my Eames chair.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.646
I think you mean my Eames chair

11:31.670 --> 11:33.816
and my jukebox

11:33.840 --> 11:36.436
and my drones... which are all
frivolous purchases, by the way.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.146
What is angry cop talking about?

11:38.170 --> 11:42.066
You stole my identity...
John Nolan.

11:42.090 --> 11:44.900
Yeah. How's that for luck?
You stole a cop's identity.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.186
Look, there's obviously been
some sort of misunderstanding.

11:48.210 --> 11:51.186
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay.
So, here's what's gonna happen.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.776
A truck is gonna come
and get all of this stuff

11:53.800 --> 11:56.356
because it's not your stuff...
It's evidence

11:56.380 --> 11:58.686
that will eventually be sold off
to pay back all your victims.

11:58.710 --> 12:00.066
You can't do that.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.736
Oh, but the law says that I can.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.896
Officer West.
I got a job for you.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.026
I need you to catalog a house
full of stolen property.

12:08.050 --> 12:10.186
Uh, Sergeant Grey already
gave me a long list of jobs.

12:10.210 --> 12:12.146
Well, this one
is more time-sensitive.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.686
Are you gonna explain
to Sergeant Grey

12:13.710 --> 12:15.736
if I don't get his list done?
Yeah, I got you covered.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.276
Thank you, ma'am.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.736
Oh, there's just one thing
I need to finish,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.146
and then I'm all yours.
Alright.

12:20.170 --> 12:22.436
Wait, Smitty!
Help me move this thing.

12:22.460 --> 12:23.776
Looks fine where it is.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.396
It's a code violation.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.146
It's supposed to be
3 feet from a fire exit.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.736
My back's been acting up.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.090
Get over here and push.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.896
Hold on.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.146
What is this?
Whoa.

12:38.170 --> 12:41.646
This case is over a year old,
and it was never assigned.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.436
What do I do with it? Put
it back where you found it.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.236
What?
I can't do that, Smitty.

12:45.260 --> 12:48.976
Kid, that file is as cold as ice
and guaranteed trouble.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.646
Look, it's an open case
and... look,

12:50.670 --> 12:52.686
there's even a print to run.

12:52.710 --> 12:54.816
It is a little degraded,
though. A little?

12:54.840 --> 12:57.106
The most important thing
you can learn in this job

12:57.130 --> 12:59.566
is never volunteer for anything.

12:59.590 --> 13:01.646
Okay, look, this case literally
fell through the cracks.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.606
Yeah, although
it is a simple vandalism case,

13:03.630 --> 13:05.710
I mean, the victim
still deserves justice.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.236
You're a good man.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.670
And I was never here.

13:18.420 --> 13:19.630
You nervous?

13:21.500 --> 13:23.476
A little.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.140
Just speak from the heart.
You'll do fine.

13:29.090 --> 13:32.566
That day changed me forever.

13:32.590 --> 13:36.816
Seeing a cop die wearing
the same uniform I was...

13:36.840 --> 13:38.380
as I held his hands.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.210
Did you know that was
my first day on the job?

13:47.380 --> 13:50.606
Yeah, I did.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.436
I've been impressed

13:52.460 --> 13:55.276
in how you've handled
every day since.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.276
That's why I reached out
when I became Watch Commander...

13:58.300 --> 14:01.736
I needed cops like you
to set an example.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.736
How about you?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.316
You nervous?

14:06.340 --> 14:07.880
Know what you're gonna say?

14:09.590 --> 14:11.736
Nervous? No.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.976
I knew this day would come.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.800
I just didn't think
it would come so soon.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.960
I'd do anything to get him back.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.550
Today's for Dennis.

14:26.550 --> 14:28.526
Damn straight.

14:33.590 --> 14:34.936
Turn to the left.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.686
Uh, that's not really
my good side.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.236
Please face left.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.026
Is this all just a game to you?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.396
Well, as the Buddha says,

14:45.420 --> 14:47.356
"When the mind is pure,
joy follows

14:47.380 --> 14:50.106
like a shadow
that never leaves."

14:50.130 --> 14:52.026
I read it on a fortune cookie.
What do you want?

14:52.050 --> 14:54.936
You honestly don't feel
any guilt or shame about this?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.816
For what?
I'm an innocent man.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.436
Who's about to be locked
in a cell.

14:58.460 --> 15:00.760
Well, until my lawyer
comes to bail me out.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.840
Nolan.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.146
- What's up?
- I calculated the value

15:12.170 --> 15:13.476
of all the items

15:13.500 --> 15:16.276
that Officer West catalogued
at the residence so far,

15:16.300 --> 15:18.816
and when you
cross-reference the valuation

15:18.840 --> 15:20.856
of all the seized assets
against the...

15:20.880 --> 15:22.646
Okay, d-d-don't get
all mathy on him.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.356
Oh, gosh, sorry.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.106
We know that Mr. Neil,

15:26.130 --> 15:28.316
he stole close
to $2 million, right?

15:28.340 --> 15:32.606
However, the value
of his seized assets,

15:32.630 --> 15:34.356
they're only worth $700,000.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.276
So, where's the missing money?

15:36.300 --> 15:38.436
My guess is that the money
is probably

15:38.460 --> 15:41.896
sitting pretty
in an offshore account.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.476
How can we find that?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.436
The information is most
likely on his computers.

15:45.460 --> 15:48.276
However, his computers
happen to be R.S.A.-encrypted,

15:48.300 --> 15:51.066
which means there's totally
no way we can crack them.

15:51.090 --> 15:52.976
But if we have
Jordan's computers,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.396
he doesn't have access
to the money either, right?

15:55.420 --> 15:59.106
N-Not unless he's got
a backup... drive.

15:59.130 --> 16:01.356
Which is the first thing
he'll head for

16:01.380 --> 16:02.816
once he bails out,

16:02.840 --> 16:05.396
leaving all of his victims
to get pennies on the dollar

16:05.420 --> 16:07.026
while he slips off
to a non-extradition country

16:07.050 --> 16:08.646
and sips Mai Tais on a beach.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.396
What are you doing?
I'm calling Jackson,

16:10.420 --> 16:13.106
having him start searching
for that backup drive right now.

16:13.130 --> 16:15.526
Tim: Look, there are nearly
4 million people in Los Angeles.

16:15.550 --> 16:18.436
The odds of finding
one person are miniscule.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.106
But all 4 million
aren't breaking into cars

16:20.130 --> 16:22.316
in this neighborhood, are they?

16:22.340 --> 16:25.276
No,
sir. See? We've already narrowed it down.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.066
The thing is, if he's smart,

16:27.090 --> 16:28.976
he hit as many cars
as he could in 10 minutes

16:29.000 --> 16:29.977
and then jumped on the freeway.

16:30.001 --> 16:31.356
He could be in Barstow by now.

16:31.380 --> 16:33.396
"If he's smart"?

16:33.420 --> 16:35.896
When you have you ever known
a criminal to be smart, Lucy?

16:35.920 --> 16:39.236
He's probably
taking a break nearby,

16:39.260 --> 16:42.476
having tacos with extra cheese,
extra salsa.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.356
That your guy?

16:44.380 --> 16:45.526
That's my guy.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.856
I'm gonna need you to put your
hands on the van, spread your legs.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.566
Hey.
Don't even think about it.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.396
Don't move.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.356
Guess L.A. isn't such
a big city after all.

17:16.849 --> 17:18.826
Lucy: Retired or not, Mr. Hall,
you've still got it.

17:18.849 --> 17:20.156
Colin:
Oh, that was easy.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.406
Back in Sweet Home,
we ride one cop per cruiser.

17:22.430 --> 17:24.156
None of this partner stuff.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.576
Hell, if you can't take down
a suspect alone,

17:26.599 --> 17:27.945
shouldn't be on the job.

17:27.970 --> 17:29.986
Hope I didn't step on any toes.

17:30.010 --> 17:31.366
Tim: No,
no problem at all.

17:31.390 --> 17:33.276
Just glad you're getting
your bag back.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.866
Yeah.
And there it is.

17:34.890 --> 17:36.946
Yep, we just need to document
it, and you're good to go.

17:36.970 --> 17:38.656
Yeah, I'll, uh,
snap a couple of pics,

17:38.680 --> 17:41.616
and then I'll sign it out
as returned to rightful owner.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.236
Look, clearly,
you're a good cop.

17:44.260 --> 17:45.776
I appreciate that.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.826
Dedicated, selfless,
and takes pride in his work.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.576
A little sphinctered maybe,
but that can be good, too.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.576
Just not for my daughter.

17:54.850 --> 17:57.236
Excuse me? Forget
about police divorce rates.

17:57.260 --> 17:59.656
What kills me is that
if the lights go out

17:59.680 --> 18:01.776
and... and crazy
washes over this town,

18:01.800 --> 18:03.076
you'll run out into the night.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.486
Sir, it's every cop's duty to...

18:04.510 --> 18:05.986
Yeah, I understand that, son.
I get it.

18:06.010 --> 18:09.326
But my daughter cannot
be left alone in the dark.

18:09.350 --> 18:12.276
I was just like you.
Always put the job first.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.276
Saw what it did to my wife.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.470
I do not want that
for my baby girl.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.116
I know how much
you care about Rachel.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.986
That's why I think
you'll do the right thing

18:24.010 --> 18:25.536
and let her go.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.406
Okay, Mr. Hall.
We're all set.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.736
Well, there goes
Henry's tuition right there.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.196
Only if we can prove in court

18:39.220 --> 18:42.276
that it was purchased
with illicit funds.

18:46.800 --> 18:47.866
Find anything?

18:47.890 --> 18:50.326
Afraid not.
Jordan bail out yet?

18:50.350 --> 18:52.536
About an hour ago.
Where have you looked so far?

18:52.560 --> 18:54.276
I-I checked all upstairs, and I just
started down here.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.486
Alright. Alright.
Let's keep looking.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.076
Hey, do you guys mind
taking it from here?

18:57.100 --> 18:58.906
I, uh, reached out to this
victim on this cold case,

18:58.930 --> 18:59.907
and he's on his way
to the station.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.406
Go ahead. We got it.
Thank you.

19:01.430 --> 19:03.116
Thank you for your help.
Yeah.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.826
Alright.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.986
What happened to your lip?

19:11.010 --> 19:13.536
What? Nothing.
I, uh, ran into a door.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.277
You know you can't be here.

19:14.301 --> 19:15.866
It's my house.

19:15.890 --> 19:18.090
Not until we release it,
and we are not done processing.

19:19.180 --> 19:21.826
Well, can I at least
grab my meds?

19:21.850 --> 19:24.196
I've got GERD.
The reflux is a bitch.

19:24.220 --> 19:25.366
I'll have to accompany you.

19:25.390 --> 19:26.560
Whatever.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.656
Alright. You got 'em.
Now you got to go.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.326
I just need one more thing.

19:34.350 --> 19:35.866
And what's that?

19:35.890 --> 19:39.576
To use la toilette,
s'il vous plaÃ®t.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.736
Number...

19:40.760 --> 19:42.486
I get it.
Yeah.

19:42.510 --> 19:44.906
What do you think this is,
"The Godfather"?

19:44.930 --> 19:46.036
Like I'm gonna come out
shooting?

19:46.060 --> 19:48.736
Based on your history
of dumb decisions...

19:48.760 --> 19:49.930
All clear.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.406
Hurry up.

19:54.430 --> 19:55.986
I'm gonna turn the faucet on.

19:56.010 --> 19:57.760
What I'm about to do,
you can't un-hear.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.560
Where's your body cam?

20:08.350 --> 20:11.036
What if he really had to go?

20:11.060 --> 20:12.776
You know,
I'm a victim here, too.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.946
I lost everything
in the financial crisis.

20:14.970 --> 20:16.366
And I thought,
"Well, hey, I'm only 30.

20:16.390 --> 20:17.536
I could start again."

20:17.560 --> 20:19.236
So I did.
I went back to school.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.776
I tried to get
into making video games.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.906
But I'd already aged out.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.736
That doesn't excuse
what you did, Jordan.

20:24.760 --> 20:25.946
Allegedly did.

20:25.970 --> 20:28.116
You stole people's money.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.236
Their nest eggs.
Their college funds.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.366
And for what?

20:32.390 --> 20:33.616
For stuff.

20:36.430 --> 20:37.536
Hand it over.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.736
I'm not sorry anymore

20:38.760 --> 20:40.866
for allegedly taking your money.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.196
Don't forget to wash your hands.

20:49.970 --> 20:52.196
Not waiting for no tow truck.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.576
You're not supposed
to change your own tires.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.986
It's a rule for a reason.
I know the rule.

20:56.010 --> 20:58.656
It's been awhile
since I changed a tire.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.196
Believe it or not...

21:01.220 --> 21:03.036
...I just did this last week
on Luna's car.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.430
Apparently, you're bad luck.

21:08.430 --> 21:10.486
Alright.

21:10.510 --> 21:12.406
Son of a bitch!

21:12.430 --> 21:14.236
That's why we should call
the tow truck.

21:14.260 --> 21:15.736
The guys at the garage
use the pneumatic drill

21:15.760 --> 21:17.406
to lock those in place.
I got it. I got it.

21:17.430 --> 21:18.680
Just...

21:21.180 --> 21:23.736
Damn it!

21:23.760 --> 21:24.776
You okay?
Damn it!

21:24.800 --> 21:27.236
Fine. Geez.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.946
God. He was just getting
his life back on track.

21:29.970 --> 21:31.276
Dennis?

21:31.300 --> 21:32.616
He was a complicated guy.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.696
I mean, he put Christine
through a lot,

21:34.720 --> 21:37.076
but he was a good man.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.076
He just got back
from a leave of absence.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.140
I mean, I-I talked him
into going to rehab.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.800
What?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.826
Nothing.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.326
Oh, please, Angela.
Just what is it?

21:55.640 --> 21:56.880
He was drunk the night he died.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.866
No, he was sober four months.

22:01.890 --> 22:03.866
Then he must have stumbled

22:03.890 --> 22:05.326
'cause I smelled alcohol
on his breath

22:05.350 --> 22:07.036
while I was trying to save him.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.446
I'm sorry.

22:08.470 --> 22:09.946
I-I had mentioned it
to my T.O.,

22:09.970 --> 22:11.866
but he told me
to keep it to myself.

22:11.890 --> 22:14.576
Till this moment, I...

22:14.600 --> 22:16.406
I assumed you knew.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.536
Want some advice?
Not from you, thanks.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.156
I'm gonna give you some anyway.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.076
Confess and pay restitution
to your victims.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.696
It could take years
off your sentence.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.276
I told you, I'm innocent.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.156
My neighbors love to gossip.

22:39.180 --> 22:40.326
I'm... I'm gonna leave
out the back.

22:40.350 --> 22:41.576
Who's in the SUV?

22:41.600 --> 22:43.116
I don't know. No idea.
Are you sure?

22:43.140 --> 22:44.406
'Cause you seem
a little freaked out.

22:44.430 --> 22:47.616
Yeah, I'm positive.
Can I go now?

22:47.640 --> 22:49.656
Yeah. I'll walk you out.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.906
Whatever.

23:03.180 --> 23:05.866
On behalf of the LAPD,
I'd like to apologize.

23:05.890 --> 23:08.326
For what?
What am I doing here?

23:08.350 --> 23:10.536
For the vandalism incident
at your home.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.576
I know it was over a year ago,
but, once again, sir,

23:13.600 --> 23:15.276
I-I'm so sorry that we didn't
get back to you sooner.

23:15.300 --> 23:18.276
Forget it. It's fine.
Just graffiti on my garage.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.486
You know, I know you all
have bigger cases to solve.

23:20.510 --> 23:22.236
Every single case
is important to us, sir.

23:22.260 --> 23:25.276
And with yours,
we have some very good news.

23:25.300 --> 23:28.036
We were able to lift a partial
fingerprint of the vandal.

23:28.060 --> 23:29.736
You did? Yeah,
it was embedded in the spray paint,

23:29.760 --> 23:31.326
so it has to be the vandal's.

23:31.350 --> 23:32.576
I'm sending the prints
to the lab.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.236
Eh, don't.

23:34.260 --> 23:35.986
The insurance company already
took care of the damage.

23:36.010 --> 23:38.576
I-I understand that,
but the LAPD have to...

23:38.600 --> 23:40.946
Sounds like a big waste of
taxpayer money, if you ask me.

23:40.970 --> 23:42.826
I mean, you guys dropped
the ball on this one,

23:42.850 --> 23:45.946
and I don't appreciate this pathetic
attempt to make up for it, so...

23:45.970 --> 23:47.736
Yes, sir, we are going to do
everything we can to make it...

23:47.760 --> 23:51.616
Look, it's in the past, Officer.
I'd like to keep it there.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.010
Now I got to get to work.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.236
It was really great
seeing you again, Mr. Hall.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.276
Aww! Alright.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.446
I'm so proud of you.

24:02.470 --> 24:03.850
Thank you.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.736
Look.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.576
I don't know
where Rachel and I are headed,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.866
but I want to find out.

24:13.890 --> 24:15.406
And if you really care
about your daughter,

24:15.430 --> 24:17.156
you won't get in the way
of her happiness.

24:17.180 --> 24:19.036
Son, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:19.060 --> 24:20.656
Sir, with all due respect,
when it comes to Rachel,

24:20.680 --> 24:22.076
yes, I do.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.826
Really? What if she gets sick?
What then?

24:23.850 --> 24:25.406
Then I'll take care of her.
And you're prepared to do that,

24:25.430 --> 24:27.616
knowing everything it'll entail?

24:27.640 --> 24:30.696
I'm sorry.
Every... Everything what will...

24:30.720 --> 24:31.826
What are you talking about?

24:31.850 --> 24:34.656
Uh, I thought she had told you.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.536
Told me what?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.446
Rachel may have
Huntington's disease.

24:38.470 --> 24:40.300
It's a fatal genetic disorder.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.866
But you... you said
Rachel may have it. Uh...

24:44.890 --> 24:46.446
It's hereditary.

24:46.470 --> 24:48.826
My dad had it later in life.

24:48.850 --> 24:51.036
Died from it.

24:51.060 --> 24:52.826
Hit my sister in her 20s.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.616
I tested positive
for the gene that causes it,

24:57.640 --> 25:01.366
so I know
it's only a matter of time.

25:01.390 --> 25:04.116
And I also know
that it's a possibility

25:04.140 --> 25:06.696
that I could've
passed it along to Rachel.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.536
But she won't get tested.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.366
She thinks it's...
It's better not to know,

25:10.390 --> 25:13.576
uh, her way of living
her life as normal as possible.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.366
That is until the symptoms
start to show.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.736
But she might not have it.
Maybe.

25:18.760 --> 25:23.276
Or maybe I gave my baby girl
a genetic time bomb.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.656
But now you understand
why you can't be with her.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.946
Because if worst comes to pass,
Rachel's gonna need someone

25:28.970 --> 25:30.696
who'll put aside everything else

25:30.720 --> 25:32.326
just to care for her.

25:32.350 --> 25:35.946
You and I both know
that's not you.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.156
- This is beautiful.
- What's on the drive?

25:47.180 --> 25:49.406
Passwords to two different
Swiss banks

25:49.430 --> 25:50.946
and, oh, by the way,

25:50.970 --> 25:52.776
three banks
in the Caymans, baby.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.486
So, this will expedite my case?

25:54.510 --> 25:57.406
Yes, this... this bad boy
just got kicked into overdrive,

25:57.430 --> 26:00.076
which means y-you can expect
to get your money back

26:00.100 --> 26:02.116
in like 15 months.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.946
And if you're lucky ducky,
my friend,

26:03.970 --> 26:05.720
you'll get back
40 cents on the dollar.

26:07.970 --> 26:09.196
Boom.

26:09.220 --> 26:10.866
Nolan:
I can't believe this.

26:10.890 --> 26:13.486
I started working
when I was 19 years old.

26:13.510 --> 26:14.826
Took me 20 years,

26:14.850 --> 26:17.826
but I built a business,
a family, a life.

26:17.850 --> 26:20.276
And now here I am, starting over

26:20.300 --> 26:22.736
with literally
less than nothing.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.116
And yet it's gonna be okay.

26:24.140 --> 26:26.196
I pushed Henry to go to
his reach school.

26:26.220 --> 26:27.576
He worried
that it was too expensive,

26:27.600 --> 26:28.906
but I wanted to give him

26:28.930 --> 26:30.116
the head start
my old man never gave me,

26:30.140 --> 26:32.776
and now how am I gonna
pay for that?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.576
My God.
What am I gonna tell him?

26:34.600 --> 26:36.116
Nothing yet.
Really?

26:36.140 --> 26:37.406
'Cause he's gonna figure
it out fairly quickly.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.986
Okay, listen. Look.
I have been in your shoes.

26:40.010 --> 26:42.486
And still am in some ways.

26:42.510 --> 26:44.236
And I didn't know
how I was gonna get back.

26:44.260 --> 26:47.406
But then I met
a super-annoying rookie

26:47.430 --> 26:49.036
who helped me see

26:49.060 --> 26:51.326
that it is never too late
to re-create yourself.

26:51.350 --> 26:52.906
Trust me,
you're gonna find a way

26:52.930 --> 26:54.276
to keep your kid in that school.

26:54.300 --> 26:57.076
And remember,
you are not alone in this.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.446
You've got people
who care about you.

26:59.470 --> 27:01.236
Thank you.
Don't get excited.

27:01.260 --> 27:03.116
I am not one of them.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.510
But... you're growing on me.

27:06.850 --> 27:08.116
Lucy: This is horrible.

27:08.140 --> 27:10.326
"Huntington's disease
is a fatal genetic disorder"

27:10.350 --> 27:12.656
that causes
the progressive breakdown

27:12.680 --> 27:14.156
"of the nerve cells
in the brain."

27:14.180 --> 27:15.776
And you had no idea
Rachel might have it?

27:15.800 --> 27:18.076
No. I mean,
she never told me.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.866
I don't understand.
I swear, this is so cra...

27:19.890 --> 27:22.656
Hey. Did something happen
with my dad?

27:22.680 --> 27:25.906
He's been acting weird
ever since you got his bag back.

27:25.930 --> 27:28.720
Rachel, I'm so sorry.
Just...

27:31.430 --> 27:33.946
He told you.

27:33.970 --> 27:35.576
I can't believe him.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.446
We should go talk.

27:37.470 --> 27:38.946
No, we shouldn't.

27:38.970 --> 27:40.366
This is none of your business.

27:40.390 --> 27:43.116
Rachel, I...
This is my life, Tim.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.300
Not my father's, not yours.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.036
Jackson:
That's Tony Coulson,

27:53.060 --> 27:54.326
the victim in the vandalism case

27:54.350 --> 27:55.986
I found behind the file cabinet.

27:56.010 --> 27:58.196
I ran that fingerprint
that was inside

27:58.220 --> 27:59.986
and got a match... a suspect.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.010
Great.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.656
No?
No, the suspect is dead,

28:04.680 --> 28:05.866
found beaten to death

28:05.890 --> 28:07.366
just a block
from Tony's house...

28:07.390 --> 28:09.076
Just one day after the crime.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.236
So, you think it was Tony
getting some payback.

28:11.260 --> 28:13.906
Well, I would need
a senior officer present

28:13.930 --> 28:15.866
so I can interrogate
Mr. Coulson.

28:15.890 --> 28:18.366
Forget it. Your entire case
is circumstantial.

28:18.390 --> 28:20.986
The only way to close it
is to get a confession,

28:21.010 --> 28:22.946
and that guy looks way too calm.

28:22.970 --> 28:24.986
Kick it up to Homicide
and move on.

28:25.010 --> 28:27.036
No, no, he's primed
and ready to break.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.946
Look, I've kept him waiting
an hour and a half,

28:28.970 --> 28:30.826
maxed out the heat in there
so his core temperature

28:30.850 --> 28:32.776
is triggering a
fight-or-flight response.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.036
Look, he just needs a push.
I'm looking at the guy.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.696
He's nowhere near
ready to break.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.696
I did it!

28:38.720 --> 28:40.116
It was me!

28:40.140 --> 28:41.366
I killed him!

28:41.390 --> 28:43.196
That bastard came back
the next day

28:43.220 --> 28:45.406
to graffiti my garage again!

28:45.430 --> 28:48.156
Can you believe that?
I had just painted it!

28:48.180 --> 28:49.406
I chased him for a block,

28:49.430 --> 28:50.986
and he came at me, we fought,

28:51.010 --> 28:53.236
and then the... and then...
It was an accident.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.776
I swear!

29:02.890 --> 29:04.510
Hello?

29:07.260 --> 29:09.696
Never mind.

29:12.140 --> 29:13.140
You were saying?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.196
I got a hit on that SUV,

29:16.220 --> 29:18.616
the one that was idling
in front of Jordan's place.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.276
It belongs
to a seriously bad guy.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.036
Daxton Reid.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.866
He runs everything
from heroin to weapons

29:23.890 --> 29:24.986
out the back of his auto shop,

29:25.010 --> 29:26.696
and he carries around a machete

29:26.720 --> 29:28.576
because he likes
the way it cuts through bone.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.866
Daxton Reid.
I know that name.

29:29.890 --> 29:31.656
He's on the list
of Jordan's victims.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.696
That's why he was skulking
around Jordan's place.

29:33.720 --> 29:34.906
He found out
who stole his money,

29:34.930 --> 29:36.236
and now he wants it back.

29:36.260 --> 29:37.776
It also explains
Jordan's split lip.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.446
A little
"motivational violence."

29:39.470 --> 29:40.986
What are the odds that two
of the people he ripped off

29:41.010 --> 29:43.156
are a cop and a psycho?

29:43.180 --> 29:44.486
It'd be funny if Jordan
wasn't about to end up

29:44.510 --> 29:46.116
cut into pieces.

29:46.140 --> 29:47.736
Well, we got to find Jordan
before that happens.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.076
How? His watch was logged
as evidence.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.076
Actually, I let him keep that

29:51.100 --> 29:53.576
just in case we needed
to find him again.

29:55.510 --> 29:58.196
If you guys wait here, we'll
call you in when we're ready.

29:58.220 --> 29:59.866
Just a couple of rules.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.656
You are not to speak

30:01.680 --> 30:03.446
or make eye contact
with the inmate.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.236
Direct all your comments
to the Prison Board.

30:05.260 --> 30:06.237
Understand?

30:06.261 --> 30:07.680
Yes.

30:11.850 --> 30:12.946
You okay?

30:12.970 --> 30:14.866
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:20.850 --> 30:22.276
I'm guessing this is yours.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.390
Yes, sir.

30:25.430 --> 30:27.116
Curveball?
Slider.

30:27.140 --> 30:28.946
Slider.
Who taught you that?

30:28.970 --> 30:30.866
My dad taught me.

30:33.010 --> 30:34.536
- Dad.
- Hey.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.446
I missed you guys.

30:39.930 --> 30:41.406
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

30:41.430 --> 30:43.866
Then don't.

30:43.890 --> 30:46.656
Sir...

30:46.680 --> 30:48.616
going to prison saved my life.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.076
I was high off my ass
that night.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.077
A full-on drug addict.

30:51.101 --> 30:52.116
I don't even remember it.

30:52.140 --> 30:54.486
He does.
Russell, stop.

30:54.510 --> 30:58.366
It's okay.
He needs to see who I was...

30:58.390 --> 31:00.986
and what I'm working to become.

31:01.010 --> 31:03.036
A better man.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.366
A better example to him.

31:11.010 --> 31:13.826
Jordan's still on the move.

31:13.850 --> 31:15.446
He's about half a block ahead.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.036
That's him right there.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.326
Looks like Daxton
got to him first.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.826
Here we go.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.406
7-Adam-15
in pursuit of black SUV,

31:37.430 --> 31:39.760
south on Santa Fe,
requesting backup and airship.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.536
He just took a quick left.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.486
Dispatch: 7-Adam-15, Airship 1
arriving on scene.

31:50.510 --> 31:51.906
7-Adam-15.

31:51.930 --> 31:54.330
Vehicle is stopped just north of
the Amtrak Maintenance Yard.

31:54.930 --> 31:56.560
Tracker says
he's still inside the car.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.946
LAPD! Exit the car
with your hands up!

32:06.430 --> 32:08.116
Harper?
Clear.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.366
Harper.

32:21.510 --> 32:24.366
I got blood.

32:24.390 --> 32:25.486
Daxton must've figured out

32:25.510 --> 32:26.656
we were tracking Jordan
by his watch.

32:26.680 --> 32:27.946
Why cut off his hand?

32:27.970 --> 32:29.576
Why not just kill him?

32:29.600 --> 32:31.866
'Cause Daxton wants
his money back.

32:31.890 --> 32:33.826
Jordan may not have access
to the money he stole,

32:33.850 --> 32:35.906
but he has the skills
to steal more.

32:37.430 --> 32:39.196
Blood trail stops.

32:39.220 --> 32:41.196
Yeah, he must've
wrapped his arm.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.486
Alright.
Uh, let's split up.

32:42.510 --> 32:43.616
I'll take east, you go west.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.656
Okay, uh,
west is... that way.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.486
Yes, that is west.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.870
I'm trying to get used to the
coast being on the other side.

33:08.890 --> 33:11.656
Come out of there right now!

33:11.680 --> 33:13.486
I see a gun, and you're dead.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.116
Lie down, arms out, legs spread.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.486
Pilot:
Officer, on your 6:00!

33:49.720 --> 33:52.116
7-Adam-15.

33:52.140 --> 33:55.156
Two in custody, two outstanding.
Thanks for the assist.

33:55.180 --> 33:57.906
7-Adam-15, copy that.
Nice shooting.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.986
Jordan: You didn't
have to c-cut off my hand.

34:04.010 --> 34:05.826
They were tracking your watch.

34:05.850 --> 34:08.366
There's easier ways
to take off a watch, dude.

34:15.429 --> 34:16.576
Hey, big guy.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.850
Aah!

34:18.560 --> 34:19.985
Aah!

34:20.010 --> 34:22.196
Ohh!
Hey!

34:23.429 --> 34:25.156
You okay?
My eyes are on fire!

34:25.179 --> 34:26.260
Not you.

34:27.760 --> 34:30.235
Hey, stay with me.
7-Adam-15. Code 4.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.366
I have an adult male,
severed left hand,

34:32.389 --> 34:34.406
severe blood loss,
unconscious but breathing.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.616
Send an R/A unit to my location.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.179
Jordan, stay with me, buddy.

34:42.429 --> 34:43.775
Officer Rowland's murder

34:43.800 --> 34:47.656
was my first experience
as a police officer.

34:47.679 --> 34:50.235
I tried desperately
to save his life

34:50.260 --> 34:53.446
and held his hand as he died.

34:53.469 --> 34:54.775
And did the same
for Sergeant Grey,

34:54.800 --> 34:56.139
riding with him to the hospital.

34:59.350 --> 35:02.946
The nightmares
are less frequent now.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.486
But the thought
of Russell Scanlin

35:04.510 --> 35:05.946
being released back into society

35:05.970 --> 35:07.656
is too painful to bear.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.536
And I urge the Board

35:09.560 --> 35:12.866
to reject his application
for parole.

35:12.890 --> 35:14.300
Thank you.

35:16.260 --> 35:17.826
Let the record reflect

35:17.850 --> 35:19.866
Officer Lopez
has completed her statement.

35:19.890 --> 35:21.326
The Board would like to invite

35:21.350 --> 35:23.510
Sergeant Wade Grey
to make a statement.

35:29.890 --> 35:32.406
Sergeant Grey, would you state
your name for the record?

35:32.430 --> 35:34.486
Sergeant Wade Grey.

35:34.510 --> 35:35.866
G-R-E-Y.

35:35.890 --> 35:37.600
Thank you.
Please proceed.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.260
Dennis Rowland was my partner.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.276
My friend.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.906
And I was the best man
at his wedding.

35:49.930 --> 35:53.036
And, um...

35:53.060 --> 35:54.890
And I miss him every day.

35:57.510 --> 36:00.116
He...

36:04.010 --> 36:06.536
Um...
I'm sorry.

36:06.560 --> 36:10.036
Um... I drove here today,

36:10.060 --> 36:13.536
confident on what
I was going to say.

36:13.560 --> 36:20.196
Um... every detail on how
my partner was killed too young.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.906
And how Russell Scanlin

36:22.930 --> 36:25.970
deserves to be buried
inside these walls.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.156
But the truth is,

36:29.180 --> 36:31.850
I can't be more eloquent
than Officer Lopez.

36:34.470 --> 36:39.036
And right now...

36:39.060 --> 36:42.276
I find myself compelled to say
something to this young man.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.680
For so long, I hated you
for what you did.

36:52.930 --> 36:54.776
And you're not done
paying for that.

36:59.260 --> 37:03.656
But I'd be lying if I sat here
and said my partner was perfect.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.326
I saw the power
of his demons firsthand,

37:06.350 --> 37:08.970
and I promised him
that he could find redemption.

37:11.850 --> 37:13.326
So what kind of man would I be

37:13.350 --> 37:16.036
if I didn't believe
the same about you?

37:18.970 --> 37:21.470
I'm not ready to forgive you
for what you did, Russell.

37:24.260 --> 37:26.946
But I will pray

37:26.970 --> 37:30.446
that if you're fortunate
to get a second chapter,

37:30.470 --> 37:32.536
you do right by your boy.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.156
Show him what it means

37:39.180 --> 37:42.236
to truly take responsibility
for your actions.

37:55.550 --> 37:57.156
Well?

37:57.180 --> 37:58.446
Parole denied.

38:06.340 --> 38:08.156
Ready to go home?

38:08.180 --> 38:11.406
Yes. I am.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.606
Thank you.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.276
Karma's a bitch, huh?

38:26.300 --> 38:27.776
That is true.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.606
You're some kind of nut job.

38:29.630 --> 38:30.866
I mean, I steal your identity,

38:30.890 --> 38:32.366
I make your life a living hell,

38:32.390 --> 38:33.776
and then you save my life?

38:33.800 --> 38:35.630
That's my job.

38:39.180 --> 38:41.316
Hey, my personal stuff's
in a bag in the closet.

38:41.340 --> 38:43.010
Would you grab it?

38:46.680 --> 38:47.680
You see that key?

38:50.550 --> 38:52.406
There's a vintage
comic book collection

38:52.430 --> 38:54.866
hidden in a storage space
on Pico.

38:54.890 --> 38:57.406
I bought it with the money
from your kid's college fund.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.406
Thanks for rubbing it in my face. No,
you don't get it...

38:59.430 --> 39:01.156
I'll swear in an affidavit

39:01.180 --> 39:02.680
that I used your money
to buy it.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.566
Then I won't have to wait for the court
to reimburse me from the general fund.

39:07.590 --> 39:08.816
I could sell the collection,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.816
have my money back
within... weeks.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.106
It seems strange to thank you

39:15.130 --> 39:17.656
for returning money
you stole from me.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.406
It's been that kind of a day.

39:19.430 --> 39:20.800
Yes, it has.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.520
I suppose a high five's
out of the question?

39:26.760 --> 39:27.800
Why don't we just bump it?

39:32.840 --> 39:35.026
Sir, you got a minute?

39:35.050 --> 39:38.026
Officer West,
you seem energized.

39:38.050 --> 39:39.366
Yes, sir.

39:39.390 --> 39:40.367
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

39:40.391 --> 39:41.946
How'd the, uh... the hearing go?

39:41.970 --> 39:44.066
Parole denied.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.260
That's great news.

39:47.180 --> 39:50.906
So, I take it that you
finished my to-do list

39:50.930 --> 39:54.106
and now Mid-Wilshire
is in complete compliance.

39:54.130 --> 39:57.316
Um, no, but I did something
even better, sir.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.026
Better than following
a direct order?

39:59.050 --> 40:01.736
No, sir. Look, uh,
that's not what I meant.

40:01.760 --> 40:05.486
What... I solved a homicide,
sir, like, on my own.

40:05.510 --> 40:07.606
By myself. Well, I mean, Smitty
was there, but it was all...

40:07.630 --> 40:11.196
Yet you didn't finish
my to-do list.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.866
Look, I-I solved
a homicide, sir.

40:13.890 --> 40:15.906
You see, there was
this file that I found,

40:15.930 --> 40:17.446
and it hadn't been assigned
to anyone yet...

40:17.470 --> 40:19.526
Unh, I'm sure I'll read
all about it

40:19.550 --> 40:22.196
in your report, Officer West,

40:22.220 --> 40:26.156
which you'll write after
you complete my to-do list.

40:26.180 --> 40:27.760
Yes, sir.

40:30.050 --> 40:31.470
Officer West.

40:34.510 --> 40:36.106
Good job, son.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.566
Hey.
Hi.

40:52.590 --> 40:56.526
Can we talk?
Yeah. Sure.

40:56.550 --> 40:58.486
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

40:58.510 --> 41:01.696
But I haven't told anyone.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.736
I don't know if I'll ever
get Huntington's.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.606
And I don't want
people giving me

41:07.630 --> 41:10.106
that same sad-eyed look
you're giving me right now.

41:10.130 --> 41:13.236
Oh. Sorry.

41:13.260 --> 41:16.276
I made the conscious decision
not to take the test

41:16.300 --> 41:18.406
to see if I carry the gene

41:18.430 --> 41:20.736
because there's no cure

41:20.760 --> 41:22.446
and there's no treatment
available.

41:22.470 --> 41:24.446
So, what would be the point?

41:24.470 --> 41:26.866
Uh, look, you don't have to
explain it to me, Rach.

41:26.890 --> 41:28.196
Every time I go to work,

41:28.220 --> 41:29.906
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it back home.

41:29.930 --> 41:31.906
Doesn't make me want to
do my job any less.

41:31.930 --> 41:32.930
Exactly.

41:37.090 --> 41:42.066
Life expectancy is 20 years
after onset.

41:43.590 --> 41:46.946
Is that fair to the guys
I'm dating? No.

41:46.970 --> 41:50.366
Which is...
why I'd understand

41:50.390 --> 41:53.906
if you want to walk away.

41:53.930 --> 41:55.606
I'm not going anywhere.

41:57.470 --> 41:58.866
I was hoping you'd say that.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.566
