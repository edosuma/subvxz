No fucking way

No fuckin' way!

is it fuckin' for?

Joel, no, no, no! Go around,
or we're gonna lose him!

09:55.720 --> 09:57.221
Joel: Well, no.
I can't go around.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.848
-Joel--
-What about oncoming traffic?

09:58.931 --> 10:01.600
You just said that there were
no other cars, Joel! Hit it!

10:01.684 --> 10:04.270
-No... No. It's too risky!
-No, no, no! Hit it! Go!

10:04.353 --> 10:05.813
It's not risky!
You can't hesitate!

10:05.896 --> 10:06.814
Just pull up and go around.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.566
-You can do it!

Don't hesitate.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.906
-I'm sorry, I hesitated.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Joel!

10:15.990 --> 10:17.616
Joel, we're gonna lose him!
Go! Go! Go!

10:17.700 --> 10:20.077
-Don't hesitate! Just go!
-Joel: Oh god! Ah!

10:20.161 --> 10:21.996

What does she need help with?

10:47.646 --> 10:49.482
Just some music
and stuff for tonight.

Yeah, no, Mom. You can't,
apparently, have one drink.

picking on me!
