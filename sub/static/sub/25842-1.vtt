UFO:
"Is that you, Ashimoto? Wow!!"

00:52.094 --> 00:58.684
Hinashi Town (Sunless Town)

01:05.190 --> 01:09.069
920:
"Awesome. Are you Ashimoto, merman?"

01:09.194 --> 01:10.904
Kunio (920) - Lead guitar, SEIREN

01:17.661 --> 01:19.788
This has sand in it.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.666
Let them soak for a while.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.836
You should stick a knife
into them and pry them open.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.754
I'll try soaking them longer.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.430
Have you applied for summer school?

01:36.513 --> 01:37.222
Yeah.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.976
This summer is crunch time.
You need to knuckle down and study.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.562
Don't go near the water.

01:43.812 --> 01:47.399
They come to this side through the holes
that have opened in the wall.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.901
Don't start on that again, Grandpa.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.530
There's merfolk
in the waters around here.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.326
Grandpa, Kai never goes
into the water, so don't worry.

02:04.374 --> 02:08.044
ASHIMOTO

02:10.672 --> 02:11.965
<i>Citizens of Hinashi...</i>

02:12.883 --> 02:14.259
<i>good morning...</i>

02:14.760 --> 02:16.219

02:33.904 --> 02:35.238
<i>at the community centre.</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:37.491
<i>Don't be discouraged.</i>

02:38.784 --> 02:40.702
Good morning, Ashimoto!

02:41.787 --> 02:42.996
Morning.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.207
You never have any energy!

02:45.332 --> 02:46.166
Good morning!

02:47.876 --> 02:49.461
And you have too much!

02:49.544 --> 02:51.046
Morning, Star!

02:53.131 --> 02:54.758
Granny Octopus is up there again!

02:55.425 --> 02:58.679
Well, she did lose her boyfriend
to the sea when she was young.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.181
How brave of her!

03:01.932 --> 03:04.101
Yuho, good morning!

03:04.351 --> 03:05.894
Good morning!

03:06.144 --> 03:08.271
- You feeling well?
- Just fine!

03:08.522 --> 03:11.024
- Load up two more crates!
- Sure thing!

03:11.108 --> 03:13.235
Yuho! Nice day, isn't it?

03:13.318 --> 03:14.236
It sure is!

03:14.319 --> 03:15.195
Morning!

03:15.320 --> 03:16.780
Good morning!

03:19.491 --> 03:21.993
Hey, did you know that was
Isaki-senpai on the PA just now?

03:22.077 --> 03:23.120
Whoa, it was?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.955
I know, right? What a shock!

03:25.038 --> 03:28.208
She swore she was gonna make it
as a model in Tokyo!

03:28.500 --> 03:31.169
I have to get outta this town soon, too.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.172
Yuho! Want a lift to school?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.511
A lift back, then? I'll wait for you!

03:42.556 --> 03:44.766
Hey, let's hang out sometime!

03:46.560 --> 03:49.271
I'll send you a friend request
on Facebook!

03:49.521 --> 03:51.690
Wait up! Ashimoto!

03:52.524 --> 03:54.943
Ashimoto, are you in a band?

03:56.194 --> 03:56.903
No.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.321
You should be in one!

03:58.572 --> 04:01.199
Ours is short on members again!

04:01.533 --> 04:04.327
So help us out with those
techniques of yours!

04:04.578 --> 04:07.706
I had no clue
that you had skills like that!

04:07.789 --> 04:12.085
I always thought that you had
a certain something, Ashimoto!

04:12.335 --> 04:14.254
You're not like anyone else around here!

04:14.671 --> 04:17.382
Maybe it's because you're from Tokyo.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.176
I can't play an instrument.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.052
Just beats and samples is fine!

04:21.136 --> 04:23.221
Yuho and I have
bass and guitar covered,

04:23.305 --> 04:25.766
but we don't have
a drummer or keyboard player.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.268
So if we added in your arrangements...

04:29.269 --> 04:31.730
I still can't believe you're "Merman"!

04:31.813 --> 04:35.650
Somebody with that kind of talent
was right under our noses!

04:35.734 --> 04:38.695
I recognized you right away from
the waterproof cell and that boat!

04:38.779 --> 04:42.365
You deleted it?
Because I made that weird comment?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.495
Making music is just a hobby for me.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.288
You're not fooling anybody!

04:48.538 --> 04:50.624
You obviously love music!

04:50.874 --> 04:51.875
I don't.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.585
I know you'll have a blast!

04:54.169 --> 04:56.087
Just come to a practice and watch!

04:56.588 --> 04:59.090
We do it in secret on Merfolk Island!

04:59.591 --> 05:00.425
Huh?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.471
Secret training on the far side
of Shadowstone!

05:07.557 --> 05:09.434
Collect them, starting from the back!

05:09.518 --> 05:10.227
I'm not done!

05:10.310 --> 05:11.561
What should I put?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.021
Hinashi High for me!

05:13.230 --> 05:14.231
And you, Kai?

05:15.357 --> 05:16.650
I didn't put down anything.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.152
You're not gonna go to high school?

05:20.946 --> 05:23.156
There aren't any high schools
that I want to go to.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.534
That's so cool!
I'm gonna write that, too!

05:26.326 --> 05:27.494
Is that a good idea?

05:27.744 --> 05:29.454
Gosh, I wrote it in pen.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.132
Hey, Ashimoto!
Pull it together!

05:41.758 --> 05:44.010
- Yes, sir!
- Put your back into it!

05:44.886 --> 05:48.431
If you won't go out to sea to work,
you're gonna make up for it on land!

05:50.183 --> 05:53.562
Ashimoto Fishing Boat Rentals
Umbrellas

05:56.648 --> 05:58.066
Odorigi Prefecture, Momonoki City,
Hinashi Town, MR. KAI ASHIMOTO

06:23.341 --> 06:28.346
From Mum

07:09.054 --> 07:11.598
<i>They say that the merfolk first appeared
in Hinashi Bay long ago.</i>

07:11.681 --> 07:12.974
<i>The Shadowstone cliff blocks the sun,</i>

07:13.058 --> 07:14.893
<i>which makes for a fine fishing ground
in the overcast bay,</i>

07:14.976 --> 07:19.397
<i>and gives the merfolk who dwelled
on Merfolk Island an ideal environment.</i>

07:19.773 --> 07:24.444
<i>But because there are so many sunken
ships that pose a navigational hazard,</i>

07:24.527 --> 07:29.407
<i>locals stay clear of it even though
excellent abalone live in those waters.</i>

07:30.075 --> 07:33.161
<i>Fearing the merfolk, residents sealed up
the gaps in Shadowstone</i>

07:33.244 --> 07:34.412
<i>between the bay and the island.</i>

07:34.955 --> 07:38.875
<i>It is a Hinashi custom to hang up dried
sea urchin husks that are painted white,</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:41.878
<i>which are said to represent
the sun that the merfolk fear so.</i>

07:41.962 --> 07:45.840
<i>The merfolk of Hinashi are sea monsters
that prey even on humans,</i>

07:45.924 --> 07:50.512
<i>and many passing ships have been lured
to their doom by their singing.</i>

07:50.595 --> 07:52.681
<i>We practice in secret on Merfolk Island!</i>

07:56.977 --> 07:58.937
Wearing one of those
makes you look like a fool!

07:59.020 --> 08:00.772
Kai can't swim, so it's okay.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.273
It makes him look metropolitan!

08:02.357 --> 08:03.441
"Kai"?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.443
We're band mates now!

08:05.610 --> 08:07.195
We can call you Kai, right?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.864
I never said
I was going to join your band.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.450
Why'd you come, then?

08:13.201 --> 08:16.287
By the way, our band's name is SEIREN!

08:25.463 --> 08:27.799
I always double-check with this app,

08:27.924 --> 08:30.468
but if you stay between these
stone piles, you won't get snagged.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.386
Why out here?

08:31.469 --> 08:34.389
Because Kunio hasn't told his folks
that he's in a band!

08:34.764 --> 08:38.559
Welcome to SEIREN's home ground!

08:39.727 --> 08:40.937
This is a Siren.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.188
A twin-tailed mermaid.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.525
Some legends say they also have wings.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.945
My granddad built this
amusement park here long ago.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.114
There's even a stage.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.954
Kai said he came prepared
with a sequence track!

08:58.913 --> 09:00.874
So you are gonna join the band!

09:01.541 --> 09:02.542
Just for today.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.045
Why are you way over there?

09:06.629 --> 09:07.797
One, two...

09:08.423 --> 09:15.305
<i>I wanna stay with you forever and ever</i>

09:15.388 --> 09:21.519
<i>Hold me tight...</i>

09:27.984 --> 09:28.777
How was that?

09:28.860 --> 09:31.321
That was awesome, Yuho! I knew it!

09:31.404 --> 09:34.699
With drums and keyboard,
we sound like a real band!

09:34.783 --> 09:36.034
What did you think, Kai?

09:36.618 --> 09:40.288
The vocals are a little too artificial.
You strain on the high notes.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.666
Yeah, when I overthink the details,
it makes it less catchy.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.711
And when you sing,
your bass playing falls behind.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.379
That's so mean, Kai!

09:48.505 --> 09:50.507
You just don't get it!

09:51.382 --> 09:52.550
Yuho!

09:52.634 --> 09:55.512
For a guy who just joined,
you're way too opinionated!

09:55.595 --> 09:57.847
- I didn't join.
- Well, keep 'em to yourself!

09:57.931 --> 10:00.767
Yuho! We still have another song!

10:12.737 --> 10:14.030
Hey, I like this!

11:38.531 --> 11:41.201
You even had vocals programmed?

11:41.451 --> 11:42.202
No.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.537
That was seriously catchy!

11:45.830 --> 11:49.959
Sounded like the merfolk
that inhabit this island!

11:50.376 --> 11:55.340
"I shall use my song
to lure your ship to its doom!"

12:00.428 --> 12:01.429
Sorry to keep you waiting!

12:03.890 --> 12:05.183
Get us out of here.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.561
Who was that singing just now?

12:08.645 --> 12:09.896
It wasn't you?

12:10.313 --> 12:13.733
Could it be one of the Sirens
beneath the waves?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.659
You're not gonna apologize?

12:23.493 --> 12:25.703
This is where you say "Sorry."

12:27.080 --> 12:28.081
Sorry.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.084
It's okay, it doesn't really bother me!

12:34.379 --> 12:37.340
Right, we've got that
long-distance swim tomorrow...

12:37.590 --> 12:39.592
Maybe we'll get lucky
and school will burn down.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.053
As much as I'd love
to help you, I can't!

12:55.066 --> 12:55.984
Oh, crap!

13:00.488 --> 13:01.823
Not so fast!

13:02.615 --> 13:04.325
You saw us, didn't you?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.620
No! We didn't see you poaching!

13:09.247 --> 13:10.164
Hey!

13:13.543 --> 13:16.087
I'm ratting you out
to the Fishing Cooperative!

13:16.170 --> 13:18.214
You know you can't harvest here!

13:18.840 --> 13:20.717
Well, if it isn't Yuho!

13:20.800 --> 13:24.178
Yuho Ebina... of Ebina Seafoods.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.058
What's with the stink eye?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.980
Don't even try to mess with us!

13:45.116 --> 13:46.743
Wh-What the hell?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.969
- Kunio! Get us out of here!
- On it!

14:17.607 --> 14:19.150
That was close!

14:20.735 --> 14:22.362
Oh, man! I gotta get home!

14:23.196 --> 14:24.906
Please look after her!

14:25.281 --> 14:27.158
How long are you gonna
keep this from them?

14:27.408 --> 14:31.996
A shrine's future chief priest
can't exactly be in a band, you know?

14:33.581 --> 14:38.461
I wish we could make our debut in
a live show or contest and get famous!

14:38.544 --> 14:41.130
Okay, then! Let's make our debut
and become famous!

14:42.131 --> 14:45.093
Anyway, I'm glad we have drums
and keyboard squared away now.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.471
I'll make us a group,
and you handle the registration.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.223
No thanks, I

14:50.306 --> 14:51.140
Bring it in!

14:53.810 --> 14:54.977
You, too.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.735
Okay. Sound carries here,
so keep it down.

15:03.152 --> 15:07.448
Let's go, SEIREN! Fight on, fight on!

15:07.573 --> 15:10.952
SHARK FIN
EBINA SEAFOODS

15:27.218 --> 15:28.511
I'm home.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.514
Welcome back.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.891
Grandpa...

15:37.854 --> 15:40.231
Grandpa, why did you
start making umbrellas?

15:41.732 --> 15:45.695
The weather in Hinashi changes
at a moment's notice, always has.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.782
"You can forget your lunch,
but don't forget your umbrella."

15:51.033 --> 15:53.035
Umbrellas are a necessity here.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.914
These can even be parasols.
I think they'll turn out good.

15:57.206 --> 16:01.794
And since I can't go fish anymore,
I have to do this to get by.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.840
Grandpa, you've seen one before, right?

16:06.132 --> 16:07.300
One of the merfolk?

16:07.425 --> 16:10.261
Like the ones in "Tales of Hinashi."

16:11.345 --> 16:12.555
You saw one?

16:13.681 --> 16:14.640
No.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.060
I'm sure they're still around.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.898
They come to this side
when the sun's not out.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.529
Did you stop going out to sea
because you're afraid of them?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.035
I'm home!

16:39.123 --> 16:41.667
Kai, I hear you went to Merfolk Island?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.588
What's this
about you joining Yuho's band?

16:50.009 --> 16:53.763
There's nothing but small fishing
businesses and umbrellas in this town.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.058
Even our family's fishing boat
rental business will end with Grandpa.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.560
You'll never be able to land a good job

16:59.644 --> 17:01.187
if you don't study hard.

17:04.773 --> 17:05.566
Kai?

17:07.568 --> 17:09.945
Kai! Dinner's not over!

17:10.195 --> 17:14.784
Stay away from the water!
They're attracted to music!

17:16.285 --> 17:17.869
This shellfish refuses to open.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.563
TERUO'S BAND
'97 TERUO MIX

17:43.646 --> 17:45.189
Dad's band?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.261
Ow!

19:07.647 --> 19:09.982
<i>A met... mam'?</i>

19:48.979 --> 19:50.147
Are you...

19:50.606 --> 19:51.982
gonna eat me?

19:53.317 --> 19:55.569
You're not... gonna eat me?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.906
You can understand what I'm saying?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.035
For real?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.875
Lu! Not eat!

20:19.552 --> 20:20.511
Lu?

20:23.514 --> 20:24.473
Lu!

20:25.891 --> 20:26.892
Who, me?

20:27.101 --> 20:28.060
Whomee!

20:29.019 --> 20:31.147
No. Not "Whomee," it's Kai.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.149
Notwhomeeitskai?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.900
No. Kai.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.946
K-A-I. Kai.

20:40.156 --> 20:46.662
Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai!

21:07.266 --> 21:08.726
This is my cell phone...

21:27.536 --> 21:28.954
Thank you!

22:20.923 --> 22:25.177
Hinashi Middle School
Long Distance Swimming Competition

22:31.725 --> 22:36.021
C'mon, move it, move it!
You'll never catch up to the girls!

22:40.734 --> 22:42.653
No breath to spare
for witty retorts, huh?

22:42.736 --> 22:45.281
If you don't like it, swim!
Swim, damn it!

22:45.364 --> 22:48.909
Kai! Even my Puppy-chan
is faster than you!

23:01.171 --> 23:02.256
Ashimoto?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.015
Jaws?

23:19.732 --> 23:20.608
Look out!

23:25.237 --> 23:26.155
What's wrong?

23:26.405 --> 23:27.656
What happened?

23:31.160 --> 23:33.537
I... won.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.832
I thought that Hinashi Town was too
dependent on the pickings in the bay,

23:36.916 --> 23:39.209
so I started a fish farm
out in the open sea.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.921
And boy, I hit it big!

23:42.212 --> 23:46.425
I tried making it as a dancer in Tokyo,
but big city life wasn't for me.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.637
There have been lots of people
in this town who were natural talents,

23:49.720 --> 23:52.640
but how many have gone to Tokyo
and made it big?

23:53.015 --> 23:54.642
Precisely zero!

23:54.725 --> 23:58.228
So I gave up my dancing
and came back here, and then...

23:58.479 --> 24:00.314
There's no telling
what life has in store!

24:00.564 --> 24:03.025
Things didn't work out for me in Tokyo,

24:03.275 --> 24:07.571
but maybe it was for the best to get
a look at this town from the outside.

24:08.405 --> 24:12.743
You kids shouldn't push yourselves
too hard, just explore all your options!

24:12.826 --> 24:13.702
End of speech!

24:18.540 --> 24:20.793
Hey, are you Ashimoto's kid?

24:21.168 --> 24:22.878
Which means you're Naoko's...

24:23.128 --> 24:26.173
Man, Naoko was such a great, cute girl!

24:26.256 --> 24:29.301
Teruo won her heart in a Battle of the
Bands, and they went to Tokyo together.

24:29.385 --> 24:32.596
The way I hear it, she's still there
making a living as a dancer!

24:33.681 --> 24:34.598
Ahem.

24:34.848 --> 24:35.933
Can we wrap this up?

24:37.017 --> 24:40.312
Oh, sorry. I forgot
what happened after that.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.689
Don't you mind me.

24:44.566 --> 24:50.197
Maintain a regular schedule
during summer vacation.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.074
You have entrance exams coming up,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.618
so stay focused on your studies,

24:54.702 --> 24:56.954
and let's all meet here,
good and recharged.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.416
- Use a parasol!
- It's cool out!

25:00.499 --> 25:01.667
For your skin.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.796
- Kai!
- You're coming to practice, right?

25:05.879 --> 25:08.298
Let's go have fun somewhere!
It's summer vacation!

25:08.382 --> 25:09.758
Great idea!

25:10.759 --> 25:12.845
I'll go to practice.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.015
I wrote a song I want to try out.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.975
Does this mean you'll join the band?

25:18.517 --> 25:19.393
Yeah.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.189
Your parents are a musician
and a dancer, so I knew

25:24.523 --> 25:28.027
All right! I'm the understanding type,
so let's practice!

25:28.110 --> 25:29.695
Meet up at the stairs, then?

25:29.820 --> 25:31.530
I'll text you once cram school lets out.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.574
It came back!

25:35.617 --> 25:37.494
HAPPY TOWN

25:37.745 --> 25:38.912
<i>Starting today...</i>

25:39.747 --> 25:41.248
<i>at 4 pm...</i>

25:42.124 --> 25:43.500
<i>the 4th...</i>

25:44.793 --> 25:46.879
<i>Fish Processing Workshop...</i>

25:48.047 --> 25:49.298
<i>will be held.</i>

25:49.548 --> 25:52.342
Hear that? They're holding
another fish processing workshop.

25:52.426 --> 25:56.013
Seems like young people
are afraid of it.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.556
Really?

25:57.639 --> 25:59.641
Kids these days are so timid

25:59.725 --> 26:03.187
that even if they take up the fishing
trade, they can't clean their own catch.

26:12.863 --> 26:15.282
This song sounds
kind of familiar somehow.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.953
I'm no good at playing by ear!
Don't you have any sheet music?

26:20.037 --> 26:22.247
You can read sheet music!
I knew it, Yuho!

26:23.123 --> 26:24.041
That's Lu!

26:26.460 --> 26:27.836
- Lu?
- Lu?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.213
Match her key.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.299
Lu! Come on out!

26:51.527 --> 26:52.402
<i>A mer...</i>

26:52.653 --> 26:53.445
...maid?

26:53.695 --> 26:55.280
- No way!
- No way!

26:55.781 --> 26:56.782
Kai!

26:59.660 --> 27:02.121
You know her? Hang on, she talked?

27:02.204 --> 27:03.288
Seriously?

27:05.582 --> 27:06.708
This is Lu.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.836
On the left is Yuho.
On the right is Kunio.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.504
D-D-D-Don't tell her our names!

27:10.587 --> 27:12.256
Yuho! Kunio!

27:12.339 --> 27:13.590
She learned them!

27:13.674 --> 27:16.760
But aren't merfolk dangerous?

27:16.927 --> 27:19.263
And... is that seaweed she's wearing?

27:21.181 --> 27:23.183
Is this a good idea? Look at her!

27:23.267 --> 27:24.017
Probably.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.394
Are you sure?

27:25.727 --> 27:27.896
She brought my phone back to me.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.399
From out of the water? Awesome!

28:26.538 --> 28:29.082
She was the one who lifted the jet ski
into the air yesterday?

28:29.166 --> 28:32.044
She also gave me a tow
during the swimming competition.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.845
Cut the engine.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.515
What's going on?

29:05.994 --> 29:09.581
I've never seen it from this direction.
From so high up!

29:32.271 --> 29:33.313
Cut it out!

29:34.690 --> 29:35.941
Let's keep this quiet.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.443
People might freak out.

29:39.027 --> 29:43.282
As you wish. I'm the type
who can keep a secret.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.449
Me, too.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.956
That song earlier was great!
What's it called?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.333
Hey... are there lyrics?

29:54.084 --> 29:56.461
You should sing it! Totally!

29:56.878 --> 29:59.423
If you're a bad singer, that's fine.
It would fit your image.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.426
This is so cool!

30:02.759 --> 30:03.802
Later!

30:09.391 --> 30:11.143
See you tomorrow, Lu.

30:14.855 --> 30:17.149
Lu, I'll get in trouble
if I stay out too

30:20.110 --> 30:25.282
TO NAOKO

30:43.216 --> 30:47.095
They're just sea urchin husks
painted white. You're scared...

30:54.436 --> 30:58.857
They say if you put your hand in there
and make a wish, it'll come true.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.868
What did you wish for?

31:10.202 --> 31:13.372
Lu, everyone friend! Everyone friend!

31:42.901 --> 31:43.860
You like it?

32:05.173 --> 32:06.133
White!

32:07.843 --> 32:08.760
Red!

32:21.398 --> 32:22.732
They eating?

32:24.901 --> 32:26.778
No, they're not eating.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.532
It's, uh... a sign
that you like someone.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.533
Like?

32:33.994 --> 32:36.913
When you're fond of someone,
you think they're special.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.457
You ever like, Kai?

32:38.540 --> 32:41.626
Well... Yeah, a lot.

32:41.710 --> 32:42.836
Like!

32:43.170 --> 32:45.338
Like! Like!

32:45.964 --> 32:52.095
Like! Like! Like! Like! Like! Like!

32:52.429 --> 32:53.472
Like!

32:57.100 --> 33:02.481
Like! Like! Like! Like! Like!

33:02.731 --> 33:04.357
Sounds like you like everything.

33:05.275 --> 33:09.029
To be honest, I don't like this town
or anyone in it.

33:09.863 --> 33:10.864
Like?

33:13.366 --> 33:15.160
Are there more merfolk?

33:15.410 --> 33:16.286
Papa!

33:16.703 --> 33:19.539
Pa... Oh, sure,
you'd have to have a dad.

33:20.540 --> 33:21.541
What about your mum?

33:21.791 --> 33:23.001
Got eat!

33:24.586 --> 33:26.796
Net! Ship!

33:27.047 --> 33:28.173
Oh.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.303
My mum isn't around, either.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.388
She get eat?

33:36.097 --> 33:37.057
She left.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.808
When I was little.

33:38.892 --> 33:42.270
Same! Lu and Kai same!

33:47.984 --> 33:48.985
Those are dogs.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.362
509s?

33:50.695 --> 33:52.322
They're kept over there.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.659
We eat?

33:55.909 --> 33:57.077
No, we don't eat.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.955
When a dog doesn't have an owner,
they end up here.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.087
Let's go. The sun's coming up.

34:12.759 --> 34:13.842
Eat?

35:05.312 --> 35:06.062
Huh?

35:06.313 --> 35:08.023
Hey, wait a minute!

35:09.899 --> 35:11.651
Hey! Hey!

35:11.985 --> 35:12.861
Lu!

35:13.778 --> 35:14.779
Lu!

35:31.046 --> 35:32.631
Mer-doggie!

35:40.221 --> 35:42.098
Wow, they're really vulnerable
to sunlight.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.740
Okay, let's catch some big ones!

36:00.492 --> 36:01.534
Is that your grandson?

36:02.410 --> 36:04.871
He sure has grown!

36:10.335 --> 36:13.505
<i>Good morning! What's your net harvest
for your designated area today?</i>

36:13.588 --> 36:15.674
<i>Between boats 1 and 2, 100 total.</i>

36:16.424 --> 36:17.592
Where have you been?

36:19.135 --> 36:21.680
At Kunio's. I texted you.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.390
In the middle of the night!
At least warn me

36:23.473 --> 36:24.224
Dad!

36:24.599 --> 36:27.060
You played in a band, too!

36:27.310 --> 36:30.355
TERUO'S BAND

36:31.481 --> 36:33.692
Q-Quit goofing around
and hit those books!

36:47.038 --> 36:49.916
I need you to say
I was with you last night.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.462
No way... It can't be...

36:54.713 --> 36:55.630
You and Yuho?

36:57.298 --> 36:58.425
With Lu.

36:59.676 --> 37:00.844
With Lu?

37:01.094 --> 37:02.387
There weren't any problems?

37:03.888 --> 37:05.598
Hello, Kai!

37:10.228 --> 37:12.897
So, I hear that you want to learn
about the merfolk?

37:13.565 --> 37:14.524
Yes, sir.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.488
For independent study
over summer vacation?

37:20.822 --> 37:22.407
Something like that.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.075
Let's see...

37:24.743 --> 37:28.705
Well, there are stories
that this shrine worshipped them.

37:28.955 --> 37:34.002
It is said that merfolk naturally burst
into flame when touched by sunlight.

37:34.252 --> 37:38.548
One folktale says that such a creature
was once captured

37:38.631 --> 37:42.177
and left out to burn in the sun
atop that bare mountain.

37:42.260 --> 37:47.015
When it died, the sea rose up,
but only within Shadowstone,

37:47.265 --> 37:50.685
climbing up to where that
shadow is right now,

37:50.769 --> 37:54.481
where it reclaimed the creature's body.

37:55.190 --> 37:59.569
The villagers, fearful that this was
a curse by Shadowstone,

37:59.652 --> 38:04.240
built an identical shrine atop
the rock wall and made offerings there.

38:04.491 --> 38:08.411
Humans and merfolk have long had
bad blood between them.

38:12.916 --> 38:17.295
Of course, I've never seen
a single one in my entire life.

38:17.545 --> 38:21.466
Maybe me losing my hair
is part of the curse!

38:21.549 --> 38:23.343
Enjoy yours while you can, Kunio.

38:23.426 --> 38:26.179
Don't even say that!
I'm never losing my hair!

38:26.262 --> 38:28.932
You spend too much on shampoo.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.433
It's a necessary expense!

38:30.850 --> 38:33.311
If there's anything else
you would like to know,

38:33.394 --> 38:35.438
look through these records.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.943
Thank you for your help.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.530
If you figure out a way to keep
your hair, make sure you tell Kunio!

38:43.613 --> 38:45.281
Bite me!

38:46.074 --> 38:48.576
That's not even funny!

38:48.952 --> 38:50.787
Baldness is inherited,
so it's gonna happen.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.622
Don't talk like that!

38:52.705 --> 38:55.083
Wishful thinking, man! Wishful thinking!

38:55.416 --> 38:57.001
There's no hope for you.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.757
Wow, I've never seen you laugh before.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.802
You always looked bored.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.429
I'm still surprised you joined the band.

39:09.556 --> 39:12.141
It's my hope! It will lead me!

39:12.642 --> 39:13.434
Hey!

39:13.560 --> 39:14.853
Here goes!

39:15.895 --> 39:18.606
Stop that! Cut it out, man!

39:20.483 --> 39:21.818
Kunio!

39:23.403 --> 39:24.195
See?

39:29.576 --> 39:30.952
HINASHI TOWN BROADCAST CENTRE

39:31.244 --> 39:32.954
Citizens of Hinashi Town...

39:33.329 --> 39:34.205
That's so loud!

39:34.289 --> 39:35.456
<i>Good...</i>

39:35.999 --> 39:37.083
<i>morning!</i>

39:37.542 --> 39:38.585
900s!

39:55.310 --> 39:56.895
"Ballad of a Singer"

40:00.315 --> 40:01.858
Ballad of a Singer

40:12.660 --> 40:13.912
Oh, right.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.205
There's no sunlight if it's raining.

40:19.042 --> 40:22.045
I've never driven a boat before.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.605
Round, round round!

40:48.363 --> 40:50.365
Round! Round!

40:54.702 --> 40:55.662
My umbrella?

40:55.870 --> 40:56.913
Brella!

40:58.831 --> 40:59.874
Round!

41:01.250 --> 41:02.502
Round!

41:06.881 --> 41:08.549
Sorry! I forgot about the flash!

41:09.008 --> 41:09.968
Uh...

41:18.226 --> 41:19.727
I can't swim!

42:38.306 --> 42:42.060
Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa!

42:55.615 --> 42:57.533
There are so many of them!

43:09.629 --> 43:11.255
Lu! I can't swim!

43:12.006 --> 43:13.299
Floaty!

43:14.217 --> 43:15.760
Floaty!

43:16.427 --> 43:20.306
- I-I'm sinking! I'm sinking!
- No fight!

43:20.932 --> 43:22.850
Forget it, I can't float!

43:22.934 --> 43:25.561
- Floaty, floaty!
- But...

43:26.104 --> 43:27.480
Really?

43:27.730 --> 43:29.774
No fight! No fight!

43:29.857 --> 43:30.775
I'm floating?

43:31.067 --> 43:32.068
Floaty!

43:32.151 --> 43:33.277
No way!

43:41.869 --> 43:45.331
The instant I thought
I might go under, I did.

43:45.915 --> 43:46.833
So if I...

44:05.935 --> 44:08.688
Father! Please think this through!

44:08.771 --> 44:09.856
Restructuring won't work.

44:09.939 --> 44:12.358
But we can't make ends meet that way!

44:12.441 --> 44:16.737
Outwards! At times like these,
you have to expand outwards!

44:17.238 --> 44:19.907
<i>All those days I spent with you...</i>

44:19.991 --> 44:21.117
Kai!

44:21.284 --> 44:22.368
Kai!

44:23.703 --> 44:26.289
You didn't hear a word I said, did you?

44:26.372 --> 44:27.582
I'm all ears!

44:27.665 --> 44:29.250
I wasn't talking to you, Kunio!

44:30.334 --> 44:31.210
Sorry.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.171
You've changed, Kai.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.715
I liked how it was hard
to get a smile out of you.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.717
Yuho says she wants to do a live set!

44:37.800 --> 44:41.012
Please consider the opinions
of the president of this company!

44:41.095 --> 44:44.807
In spite of being poor since childhood
due to the failure of Merfolk Land,

44:44.891 --> 44:47.935
he used shark fin, abalone
and sea urchin to keep the company going

44:48.019 --> 44:52.481
and grow Ebina Seafoods
into the giant it is today!

44:52.565 --> 44:54.233
We can't fish in the inner bay!

44:54.483 --> 44:56.277
And shark fin is problematic now!

44:56.360 --> 44:59.447
Hence the open sea! Fuguda says so, too!

44:59.530 --> 45:01.532
Fuguda got lucky that one time!

45:01.616 --> 45:03.576
Hey, you're Teruo's kid!

45:03.826 --> 45:04.660
How are you?

45:04.744 --> 45:05.578
Hello.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.705
Thanks for the jobs!

45:07.997 --> 45:09.582
No problem!

45:09.790 --> 45:13.044
Don't talk about the family's
personal matters in front of outsiders.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.712
It makes us look bad.

45:15.671 --> 45:20.801
Father! Why don't we have Yuho's band
play in the Lantern Festival?

45:20.885 --> 45:23.179
She's in a band with her friends!

45:23.262 --> 45:25.348
Their name is SEIREN.

45:25.431 --> 45:28.392
- Say?
- Another word for mermaid, apparently.

45:28.976 --> 45:30.519
Sure, why not?

45:31.229 --> 45:32.230
That's great!

45:32.396 --> 45:34.023
Thank you so much!

45:34.857 --> 45:36.734
You're also in the band, Kunio?

45:37.235 --> 45:39.737
Um, on behalf of Yuho, we accept!

45:40.279 --> 45:41.656
See you!

45:46.577 --> 45:49.038
- Yahoo!
- SEIREN's debut!

45:49.121 --> 45:51.707
My granddad is the town
association chairman!

45:51.791 --> 45:55.127
The Lantern Festival? The one where
you mourn people who died at sea?

45:55.211 --> 45:57.838
That's right!
The whole town's gonna be there!

45:58.089 --> 45:58.965
We can't.

45:59.215 --> 46:00.549
It's decided!

46:00.633 --> 46:02.885
If it's been decided,
you'll just have to roll with it!

46:02.969 --> 46:05.471
I can't wait to play
in front of everyone!

46:05.554 --> 46:06.764
I know, right?

46:06.847 --> 46:09.767
I don't want it to get out
that I do music.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.437
Oh, you're right!
If my folks find out, they'll kill me!

46:13.646 --> 46:14.939
What about disguises?

46:15.147 --> 46:16.649
Wouldn't that work, Kai?

46:17.733 --> 46:19.652
Why not put Lu on vocals?

46:19.735 --> 46:21.946
I bet Lu could be great on ballads!

46:22.071 --> 46:23.447
Not me?

46:23.531 --> 46:26.367
And just how are we going to parade
a mermaid in front of everyone?

46:28.744 --> 46:30.413
I have a plan!

46:34.333 --> 46:36.377
"I wish I was rich."
"I wish every day was Sunday."

46:36.502 --> 46:39.880
<i>We offer up thanks to our forebears
who pioneered our fishing grounds</i>

46:40.548 --> 46:45.886
<i>and to the Shadow that helps us.</i>

46:46.137 --> 46:47.471
This is stupid.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.682
They'll see right through it.

46:49.765 --> 46:51.892
It'll be fine as long as you don't talk.

46:52.018 --> 46:53.769
Why am I lip-syncing?

46:53.853 --> 46:57.356
<i>Hinashi is what it is today
because of you.</i>

46:57.732 --> 46:59.734
<i>Thank you, Shadow!</i>

47:11.454 --> 47:12.330
Lu!

47:22.673 --> 47:24.091
My body's moving by itself!

47:24.175 --> 47:25.468
I can't stop!

47:31.974 --> 47:33.309
This is bad! Kai, stop the music!

47:33.392 --> 47:34.769
I wish I could!

47:39.357 --> 47:40.191
Lu!

47:50.242 --> 47:51.035
Who's that?

47:51.118 --> 47:52.828
Look at her go!

47:55.664 --> 47:56.749
She's so cool!

47:57.458 --> 47:58.793
She's so cute!

48:06.634 --> 48:07.635
This is bad, Kai!

48:07.718 --> 48:08.469
Oh, Fight!

48:09.720 --> 48:11.680
- What was that just now?
- That's so cute!

48:11.764 --> 48:12.556
That's amazing!

48:12.640 --> 48:13.391
What's happening?

48:22.650 --> 48:24.276
She's so cute!

48:24.360 --> 48:25.945
- Is that CG?
- A robot?

48:26.070 --> 48:27.655
It's a mermaid!

48:27.988 --> 48:29.281
Kunio, grab the icebox!

48:29.365 --> 48:30.950
Don't use my name, idiot!

48:33.077 --> 48:34.829
Hey, wait! Stop them!

48:35.079 --> 48:36.831
- Climb!
- Where are we going?

48:36.956 --> 48:40.876
- Hey! Come back here!
- Please! Wait!

48:41.585 --> 48:42.837
Just go!

48:43.754 --> 48:44.839
" Hurry!
_ Hey!

48:45.589 --> 48:48.175
Wait! Please!

48:48.551 --> 48:50.344
Can't she control water?

48:50.428 --> 48:51.971
Not when it's in sunlight!

49:10.823 --> 49:12.032
I won't play again!

49:12.324 --> 49:14.618
Kai! That's not what I said!

49:14.702 --> 49:17.204
Stay away from the water!
And don't play any instruments!

49:17.455 --> 49:19.915
They're attracted to singing!

49:22.293 --> 49:23.878
That's hot!

49:24.086 --> 49:25.713
Where's the girl who was dancing?

49:25.796 --> 49:27.882
- Was she a mermaid?
- I bet it was CG.

49:28.382 --> 49:29.842
She had legs though, right?

49:29.925 --> 49:31.177
I wanna see her!

49:38.517 --> 49:40.895
MERFOLK
SHADOWSTONE

49:41.854 --> 49:43.147
I'm in it, too!

49:45.024 --> 49:46.901
Wow, it's racking up the views!

49:46.901 --> 49:49.361
Event in Hinashi Town

49:49.403 --> 49:51.614
There's more where these came from!

49:52.323 --> 49:55.409
Is This a Mermaid?
Hinashi Mermaid

49:56.869 --> 49:58.829
You were playing in that band,
weren't you?

49:58.913 --> 50:00.080
And you other two, right?

50:02.416 --> 50:04.293
Everybody's talking about those videos!

50:04.793 --> 50:06.420
Will you tell us what happened?

50:06.754 --> 50:07.671
I wasn't there.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.548
Yuho, we need to talk.

50:09.798 --> 50:11.091
Grandpa?

50:11.342 --> 50:13.010
They're minors who are residents here,

50:13.093 --> 50:15.596
so all interviews
should go through town hall.

50:15.679 --> 50:17.056
You're with town hall, aren't you?

50:20.184 --> 50:21.227
EBINA SEAFOODS, LTD.

50:21.310 --> 50:22.561
HINASHI FISHING COOPERATIVE

50:23.229 --> 50:24.563
HINASHI TOWN HALL

50:24.813 --> 50:27.483
You don't need us, right?

50:27.733 --> 50:30.569
Everybody wants to hear
what you boys have to say, too.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.701
Will you send Yuho home?

50:37.993 --> 50:40.037
I'm sure that we can learn
what we need from the other

50:40.120 --> 50:41.205
Daddy...

50:41.580 --> 50:43.916
I'm not leaving unless we all do.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.251
Yuho...

50:46.085 --> 50:50.839
Can you tell everyone here what
you know, in as much detail as possible?

50:50.923 --> 50:52.174
Was that a trick?

50:53.634 --> 50:57.096
It was amazing!
Such an amazing performance!

50:57.179 --> 50:59.473
It's a perfect fit for us
as a merfolk town!

51:00.182 --> 51:02.309
And their band's name is SEIREN.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.645
Where was that girl from, Yuho?

51:07.231 --> 51:08.148
You kids...

51:08.941 --> 51:11.610
had better start talking
before we stop being polite!

51:13.654 --> 51:15.281
That's enough out of you. Come on.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.450
Well, sorry about that.

51:18.534 --> 51:21.245
We're excited to hear
what you have to say, that's all.

51:21.328 --> 51:24.415
Hinashi Town has always had
legends about merfolk.

51:24.498 --> 51:27.585
And back in the day, tourists even
flocked here to see them.

51:27.668 --> 51:30.212
That's why I built Merfolk Land.

51:30.296 --> 51:32.006
Which went bust.

51:32.590 --> 51:35.801
In the old days,
merfolk always had a sinister image,

51:35.884 --> 51:38.846
but this one's a cute,
singing and dancing mermaid!

51:38.929 --> 51:40.806
I know she can be
a huge draw for the town!

51:40.889 --> 51:43.475
She was an ordinary girl
dressed up as a mermaid.

51:43.559 --> 51:45.603
- Right, Yuho?
- No, she was the real thing!

51:45.686 --> 51:48.105
If merfolk really do exist,
that's a huge problem.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.773
They do exist!

51:50.190 --> 51:55.571
In any case, this mermaid-ish girl would
be the perfect poster girl for the town.

51:55.779 --> 51:56.989
What about me?

51:57.072 --> 51:59.450
You'll become famous, too, of course.

51:59.617 --> 52:00.993
Yuho, please!

52:01.076 --> 52:03.454
Tell your poor granddad about that girl!

52:06.790 --> 52:07.583
You fools!

52:08.917 --> 52:12.087
If you get mixed up with merfolk,
it'll end badly!

52:12.171 --> 52:15.382
Gramps, we're not talking
about real merfolk here.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.259
They've always been here!

52:17.343 --> 52:20.179
I've seen it! I saw
my own ma get bit by one!

52:20.262 --> 52:21.472
This again...

52:21.555 --> 52:25.309
Things like ghosts or deep sea fish
are big draws these days.

52:25.392 --> 52:27.478
We just need to create
the right public image.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.730
- Those things eat people!
- They do not.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.445
My ma was eaten by the merfolk.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.990
They're attracted to music.

52:40.074 --> 52:46.372
<i>Your lips are small and cute</i>

52:46.705 --> 52:53.003
<i>and my lips are chapped and dry</i>

52:53.420 --> 52:56.715
<i>but whenever they meet, I</i>

53:16.568 --> 53:17.778
<i>Ma!</i>

53:19.738 --> 53:21.031
<i>Ma!</i>

53:22.282 --> 53:23.367
<i>Ma!</i>

53:39.258 --> 53:41.301
Ashimoto is telling the truth!

53:41.552 --> 53:44.763
If we let them run loose,
more people will die!

53:44.847 --> 53:48.183
My own sweetie got 'et by the merfolk!

53:48.517 --> 53:51.979
Calm down, you two.
Aquariums keep sharks, right?

53:52.062 --> 53:54.857
If we manage the mermaid properly,
it'll be safe

53:54.940 --> 53:57.234
Dad, there's no such thing as mermaids!

53:57.484 --> 53:59.820
Stop this town revitalization stuff
and just stick to

53:59.903 --> 54:02.197
This town needs a change!

54:03.490 --> 54:06.118
Thank you for your input, you two!
Now go!

54:06.618 --> 54:08.954
- Don't underestimate merfolk!
- Somebody's gonna get 'et!

54:09.037 --> 54:11.081
- Fine, fine...
- Hey, watch it!

54:11.165 --> 54:14.460
- You've made your point.
- Merfolk are real!

54:15.043 --> 54:16.628
You kids get it, right?

54:17.963 --> 54:20.549
We were just trying
to get a rise out of everyone.

54:20.924 --> 54:24.595
Our band name is SEIREN,
so we made a mermaid costume.

54:24.678 --> 54:26.180
- Say?
- A mermaid.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.640
It's perfectly fine
if it's a fabrication.

54:28.724 --> 54:32.144
We'll overlook the fact that you ruined
an important town ceremony.

54:32.227 --> 54:34.813
We just want you to tell us
about the mermaid.

54:34.897 --> 54:36.940
It broke when it fell into the water.

54:37.191 --> 54:39.067
We can't make another one like it.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.820
That was no mechanical doodad.

54:42.154 --> 54:44.948
Tell us everything again from the top.

54:45.491 --> 54:49.161
Let's discuss how we can get
this project underway immediately.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.078
Right.

54:50.329 --> 54:51.622
Dad!

54:56.168 --> 55:00.589
<i>Ah, signing a song</i>

55:02.007 --> 55:06.637
<i>that's not the hardest thing to do...</i>

55:12.601 --> 55:15.020
Man, the town association
was really into it!

55:15.103 --> 55:17.439
Everybody was dancing
like crazy at the ceremony.

55:17.815 --> 55:20.734
We made Kai's grandpa look bad.

55:20.984 --> 55:22.402
I hate lying.

55:22.486 --> 55:25.489
It's hard to keep my mouth shut
around my dad and grandpa.

55:25.572 --> 55:27.407
I'm not that kind of girl.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.660
Lu would be totally popular!

55:29.743 --> 55:33.622
I think it would be better
to introduce her properly to the town!

55:33.705 --> 55:35.707
Lu's no danger to anyone,

55:35.791 --> 55:38.752
and she's not like what Granny Octopus
and Grandpa Ashimoto described.

55:39.002 --> 55:42.089
My grandpa's totally gung-ho
about reopening Merfolk Land!

55:42.172 --> 55:45.092
He says he'll make it an amusement park
that's fun for adults, too.

55:45.175 --> 55:47.511
But my dad totally hates merfolk,

55:47.594 --> 55:50.222
so he and Grandpa get into
huge arguments every day.

55:50.848 --> 55:52.933
You can cut the tension at home
with a knife.

55:54.268 --> 55:56.687
Well, the place almost ruined
your family way back when.

55:56.770 --> 55:59.022
I don't really want to go home now.

55:59.523 --> 56:03.151
Still, construction on Merfolk Land
is really coming along!

56:03.235 --> 56:06.488
And Grandpa already has plans
for the grand opening event!

56:06.572 --> 56:08.448
He asked if we'd be interested
in playing again!

56:08.699 --> 56:10.576
That includes Lu, of course!

56:11.118 --> 56:13.537
I don't want Lu to do anything
with the band anymore.

56:14.454 --> 56:16.999
Look, I think we should be careful,

56:17.082 --> 56:20.961
but it seems to me that Lu just
wants to be friends with everyone.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.255
I mean, everybody seemed
to fall pretty hard for her.

56:23.338 --> 56:27.801
We should introduce her to Granny
Octopus and Kai's grandpa, and then...

56:28.260 --> 56:30.512
I think it would be better
to be up front with them.

56:30.596 --> 56:32.264
Lu can't be in the sun.

56:32.514 --> 56:36.351
Then we just tell them she's fragile
and can't stand the sunlight!

56:36.810 --> 56:37.728
Lu!

56:39.855 --> 56:40.898
It's not safe!

56:41.607 --> 56:42.858
Not safe?

56:43.400 --> 56:44.902
We made you that parasol

56:44.985 --> 56:47.738
to make sure you wouldn't get
any sunlight on you, right?

56:48.363 --> 56:51.450
We can keep playing music
so she'd have legs!

56:51.533 --> 56:54.369
Lu, do you wanna dance
in front of the town again?

56:57.289 --> 56:59.082
You sure love to sing and dance, huh?

57:00.208 --> 57:01.543
Then let's all do it again!

57:01.627 --> 57:03.337
Everybody's gonna love you, Lu!

57:03.462 --> 57:05.839
Lu, everyone like?

57:06.131 --> 57:09.843
Yeah! All these people are watching you!

57:09.927 --> 57:11.345
That's a lot!

57:15.223 --> 57:16.934
They same as Lu!

57:17.476 --> 57:18.852
We'll sing on Merfolk Island!

57:18.936 --> 57:21.939
Sounds like my grandpa has loved
merfolk his whole life!

57:22.022 --> 57:23.023
Same with the town!

57:23.148 --> 57:25.734
Lu friend! Everybody friend!

57:26.443 --> 57:28.236
Lu, chill out!

57:28.779 --> 57:31.239
I think you should stay
hidden until then, though.

57:33.325 --> 57:35.661
Fish Processing Workshop
Hinashi Town Chamber of Commerce

57:36.870 --> 57:38.121
What's keeping him?

57:38.413 --> 57:41.208
Maybe he's finally gotten fed up.

57:41.333 --> 57:43.168
Is this gonna be hard?

57:43.418 --> 57:45.128
Can't stomach it? We need to learn this.

58:22.207 --> 58:24.251
Hey, buddy! Where are you from?

58:29.589 --> 58:30.424
Stop that!

58:47.274 --> 58:49.067
This is the teacher?

58:49.735 --> 58:51.361
For the fish processing workshop?

58:51.778 --> 58:52.904
Wow, that's fast!

58:53.488 --> 58:54.990
That's fast!

58:56.033 --> 58:57.325
No mess, either.

58:57.617 --> 58:58.744
Same with this one!

59:05.792 --> 59:06.793
Right, then!

59:08.587 --> 59:09.546
Here we go!

59:13.008 --> 59:13.884
There's more.

59:15.385 --> 59:16.386
Here we go!

59:19.014 --> 59:20.474
I thought we were going to learn.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.225
Well, this is way faster
than us learning how!

59:23.351 --> 59:24.352
Just roll with it.

59:29.775 --> 59:31.109
Hey, it's on fire!

59:32.277 --> 59:33.278
Get water!

59:47.125 --> 59:49.669
Is he saying that they can't
be hit by sunlight?

59:49.753 --> 59:52.839
Or maybe that they lose freshness
if they sit in the sun.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.602
There's no more fish!

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.395
We're done!

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.069
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:17.531
- And now we ship!
- Our first fish processing shipment!

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.241
Oh, you're done?

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.201
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.331
My goodness! What are these?

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:29.209
Wow, that's weird!

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:36.424
I bet it's some weird thing
that Fuguda bred on his fish farm!

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:40.220
Sorry, I'm late, I forgot my cell phone!
Is everybody ready to get started?

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.514
Hang on, you're the instructor?

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:50.897
HINASHI TOWN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.933
All right, let's consider
a specific example.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.686
Let's say we have a theta.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:32.105
Let's make the length 3, for example.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:36.943
And make the height 4, and the diagonal
5, that makes it a right triangle.

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:40.405
MORI MORI CRAM SCHOOL

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:43.200
So, what does that
make the answer? Ashimoto!

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:44.826
Yes, sir.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:48.079
Um... The sine would be 4/5.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:52.125
- The cosine would be 3/5.
- Hey!

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.335
And the tangent

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:54.461
Why are you standing?

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.226
Wow, this is fresh! It's so plump!

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.144
Are you sure it's not still alive?

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:13.146
No, they're good and dead!

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.273
But that's what you get
with fish processing!

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.569
It is alive!

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:20.946
Talk about fresh!

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.656
That's fish processing!

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.786
Kai, we've been waiting for you!

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.496
We went to the presentation meeting!

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:33.083
It was amazing!
The stage has this cool ceiling!

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.878
And they showed Lu's costume!
It was so cute!

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.550
Hey! Is what he said about you
not playing Merfolk Land true?

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.930
My dad says it's okay if this is
the last time, so I'm playing.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:51.434
We might get signed by a major label!
C'mon, I know it's gonna be fun!

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:54.813
I'm not playing in the band anymore.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.982
This is gonna end badly,
and I want no part of it.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.195
Lu says she's on board!

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.156
She thinks you're gonna be playing!

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:12.414
Let's hash it out over text!
Like before!

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.543
He's back to being Zombie Kai.

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:24.092
You're sure you don't want to play?

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:27.679
It's fine. It won't make
any difference if I'm there or not.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:32.183
You should get some fresh air
instead of studying all the time.

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.935
I'll leave your dinner here.

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.565
<i>Citizens of Hinashi Town...</i>

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.734

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:57.125
<i>Your lips are small and cute</i>

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:03.798
<i>and my lips are chapped and dry</i>

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:08.511
<i>but whenever they meet, I...</i>

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.555
Say no to Merfolk Land!

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:11.598
No!

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.641
Protect the Hinashi fishing industry!

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:14.768
Protect it!

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:15.852
Chairman!

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:16.936
Step down!

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.522
Ashimoto! What are you doing?

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.900
We're totally opposed to Merfolk Land!

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.109
We're opposed!

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:25.153
Protect Hinashi Town's future!

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:26.988
Protect it!

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:34.954
<i>The chair race to mark the grand
reopening of Merfolk Land now begins!</i>

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.291
Three! Two! One!

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.460
<i>And they're off!</i>

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:43.922
<i>They all leapt off the starting line!</i>

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.006
<i>Have fun!</i>

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.926
<i>A crash! There's been a crash
on Seafront Street!</i>

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:57.936
<i>Good luck...</i>

01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.854
<i>and vent those pent-up grudges!</i>

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.523
<i>In the lead...</i>

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.608
<i>is #14...</i>

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:08.196
<i>Hinashi Sake Master Brewer...
Ryuichi Okiomi...</i>

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.825
<i>He's sober, of course!</i>

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.410
You're Lu's dad?

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.038
But she and I aren't... Not anymore.

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:30.176
Oh, you know Kai?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.346
This is our new fish processing
and town revitalization specialist!

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:35.390
Isn't he amazing?

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:38.393
MERFOLK LAND

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:42.730
WELCOME TO MERFOLK LAND

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.807
- This isn't like in the video.
- Isn't the dancing girl here?

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.559
Fess up, that was CG, wasn't it?

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.394
Yuho, move up! Up!

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:25.356
This just isn't the same...

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.858
Where's the little girl?

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.153
Where's your son?

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.864
He said he wants to focus
on studying right now.

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:36.826
Have you ever been honest with him
and told him how you really feel?

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:37.994
Her voice isn't the same.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:39.662
Where's the little girl
with the face like jelly?

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.623
Is this really the same band?

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.177
No! Don't scare her with the spotlights!

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:55.595
Don't leave your seat, sir!

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:56.429
Calm down!

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.139
Stay back from the stage!

01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.349
Lu!

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.188
- Wow!
- She's so fast!

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:06.940
_
_

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:08.942
She's a real mermaid!

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:19.953
Yuho!

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:22.914
Are you okay?

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.542
The music hasn't stopped...

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:31.089
I'm not playing,
but the music is still going!

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.012
Pro musicians!

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:42.517
I took out insurance just in case.
After all, they are middle schoolers.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.527
Flashes spook her!

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.036
- What was that?
- Wow!

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.204
I knew it, she's real!

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.252
A mermaid?

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:10.920
A real mermaid?

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:12.964
Wow!

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.591
- She's so fast!
- She's swimming!

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.803
Do you think she's gonna jump?

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:20.971
Yahoo!

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.020
<i>Everybody friends!</i>

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.192
Lu this and Lu that... Nothing but Lu!

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:34.986
You'll have interviews, so cheer up!

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:37.071
And they had another band...

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:39.948
Magazines and newspapers are here,
so let's go, okay? Okay?

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.912
- I'm leaving!
- Yuho!

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.419
Kai?

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.087
Kai! I knew it was you, Kai!

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:55.256
You did come!

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.924
It went great!

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:59.676
Daddy says he's gonna
arrange interviews,

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.470
so come do them with us!

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.932
Lu's the only one they're interested in.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.352
Yeah, I know! But we can still

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.479
You're just in it for yourself!

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.481
This is bigger than you
getting to play in front of a crowd!

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:12.939
C'mon, that's a low blow!

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:16.861
The band's never gonna work out!
No matter what you try, it's pointless!

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:19.781
Yuho, you saw how your vocals
don't matter, didn't you?

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:21.115
Who do you think you are?

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.368
You're the one
who only thinks of himself!

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:24.911
This was important, and you bailed!

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.078
Stop it!

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.412
I hate this!

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.666
We worked so hard.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.417
I wish you'd never joined the band, Kai!

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.712
I never want to see you again!

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.006
Well, stop me!

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.426
You're supposed to yell, "Wait!"

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.967
They say she was swept away by the water
in the pool all of a sudden!

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.344
- I'm just glad that everyone's safe.
- Right.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:25.888
They say that merfolk have eerie powers.

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:05.553
It's alive.

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:07.305
That's the fish processing!

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:10.933
It caught fire!

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.770
That's the fish processing?

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.855
ANIMAL SHELTER
Human-Animal Harmony

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.981
SECURITY

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.947
Their bite turns you into one of them.
Even if you're a dog!

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.868
That's so creepy!

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.578
Merfolk handiwork, apparently.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.247
Their bite turns you into one of them.
Even if you're a fish!

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:34.665
People, too?

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.292
What if my poor baby got bit?

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:37.877
But this means people can't go
swimming in the sea!

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:41.172
Merfolk drag humans into the water

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.007
and eat 'em!

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:48.596
If merfolk...

01:11:48.846 --> 01:11:50.556
If merfolk eat you, you'll...

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.266
They got them all!

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.237
What the hell?

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:11.661
Dad, why did you break up with Mum and
come back here to the middle of nowhere?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.913
I love this place.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:18.125
Your mum and I went our separate ways,
but I still root for her.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.089
<i>Hinashi Middle School...</i>

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:25.007
<i>third-year student...</i>

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:26.884
<i>Yuho Ebina...</i>

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:28.886
<i>has gone...</i>

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:30.930
<i>missing.</i>

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:34.267
<i>Anyone with any information...</i>

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.477
<i>please contact...</i>

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:38.938
<i>Ebina Seafoods.</i>

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:41.232
Yuho!

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:43.109
- No sign of her over here!
- Please answer!

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.569
Yuho!

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.489
We found Yuho's cell phone here.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:55.997
This is Yuho's last tweet.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.958
Could she have been
abducted by merfolk?

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.251
Abducted?

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.253
What did I tell you?

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:06.507
They've shown their true colours!
I knew this was going to happen!

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:08.509
She got 'et up by the merfolk!

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.389
Strange things are afoot
at Fuguda's fish farm!

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.641
They've been eating up all the fish!

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.643
That's why our catches
have been so bad!

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.521
If anything... If anything
has happened to Yuho, I

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:23.441
It was a big mistake
to use merfolk to pull in tourists!

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.611
- It'll ruin Hinashi!
- Leaving the bay is a bad idea!

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:28.529
It's best to stick to what we know!

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:36.037
Where's that mermaid most likely to go?

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.263
You sure you shouldn't be heading home?

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:58.267
They said you were missing,
so I made that announcement,

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:01.020
but when I came back home,
here you were.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.481
This is blowing up into a huge mess.

01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:05.942
I'm sorry. I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.902
And I threw my phone into the water.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.947
Hurry up and eat, okay?
I have to get up early.

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:14.116
- Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah!

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.494
I heated the bowls, too.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.788
I turned the house into a cafe

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.332
and renovated the upstairs
into a living space.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:24.460
I want to get into the tourism
business eventually.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:26.837
So there's more to you
than public announcements, huh?

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:32.885
I didn't want to get laughed at
when I tried and failed to get out,

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.553
but then I genuinely got into it.

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:39.058
You're not being honest with yourself.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:43.396
The only place you can find
the truth is inside you.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:48.609
Hey, they're saying that you
were eaten by the merfolk!

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.445
And that they caught
the mermaid that did it!

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:53.322
Aw, we can't go in?

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:56.450
- They say she's in a cage.
- Aw, I feel sorry for her!

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.036
Is the mermaid here?

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.091
- Hurry up and put it down!
- Yeah, yeah!

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.343
Enough is enough!
Where did you take Yuho?

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.846
Lu friend! Everyone friend!

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:20.349
Tell me you didn't eat her or bite her!

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:23.352
Kai, Yuho friend! Friend!

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:26.731
You may act innocent,
but you eat people!

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:28.899
I doubt a little thing like her
could have eaten Yuho.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:31.027
No, there are wolf-sized ones, too!

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.988
I wouldn't want to run into her
in a dark alley!

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.323
And that huge one
at the Chamber of Commerce is dodgy!

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:39.535
I hear the fish he prepared
don't die even when you fillet 'em!

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:42.747
They say he always has an umbrella
and only walks in the shade!

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.206
Bring that one here, too!

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:47.043
Mr. President, the chief priest wishes
to meet with you about the merfolk.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:49.336
Who does he have to thank
for being able to get by as a priest?

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.129
Tell him to beat it!

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:54.050
If she is a real mermaid, the curse
will be triggered if she is harmed!

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.051
Is Yuho okay?

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:58.054
You didn't eat her, did you?
Right? Right?

01:15:58.345 --> 01:16:01.057
Kai, Yuho, Kunio friend! Friend!

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.226
Oh, shut up!

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:07.563
This things have sunk our ships,
made a mess of our fishing grounds

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:09.565
and might even have eaten someone!

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.484
What did you do to Yuho?

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:15.446
If you're not going to talk...
If you're not going to talk, I'll...

01:16:15.529 --> 01:16:17.156
Open the roof!

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:49.730
It's on fire and barreling your way
like a freight train!

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:19.677
No, Daddy! Stop!

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:20.636
Yuho?

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:28.352
Yuho, thank goodness you're all right!

01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:30.187
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine!

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.452
What?

01:17:45.703 --> 01:17:48.622
Well, hold him off!
Don't let him near here!

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.421
It's the other one!

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:56.797
IT'S huge!

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:02.219
EBINA SEAFOODS

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.551
The tank! Use the tank to cover it!

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:05.449
Please, stop this! Let Lu go!

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:08.702
I got jealous of Lu
and ran away from home, that's all!

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.454
Lu is nothing to be afraid of!

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.456
Yuho, go home this instant!

01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:14.583
- Hey!
- Daddy!

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:21.257
Daddy, please!

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:23.133
Let me go!

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.097
G-Get off me!

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:34.520
It's the merfolk...

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.648
It's the merfolk that have been
making our lives so hard!

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.947
It's the curse of the Shadow.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.116
Everyone, you must all evacuate!

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:49.743
Th-The water! The water is rising!

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.289
Yuho! Are you okay?

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.375
Lu's in trouble because of me!

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.711
I don't know where Kai is!

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:00.629
I threw away my cell phone!

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:07.219
Then just tell everyone
at the same time!

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:11.598
Let's move!

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:14.351
Wait! Miss Yuho!

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.353
I'll get in trouble!

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.403
Mr. Chairman, sorry about this.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:30.034
Isaki-senpai says she's on her way!

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:33.537
I'd call that open.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.508
<i>Everyone, this is Yuho Ebina!</i>

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:51.013
Speak slowly! Pause between each word!

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.807
I haven't...

01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.642
been eaten by...

01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:58.979
a mermaid.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:01.732
<i>The mermaid...</i>

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:03.484
<i>Lu...</i>

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:06.403
<i>loves music...</i>

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:09.656
<i>and is a great dancer.</i>

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:12.493
<i>She's really sweet.</i>

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.162
<i>We all...</i>

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:16.663
<i>became friends...</i>

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:19.333
<i>and played...</i>

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.293
<i>in a band together...</i>

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:23.670
<i>the whole summer.</i>

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:27.257
<i>Round! Round!</i>

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:28.467
Kai!

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:30.803
Lu is...

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.390
being held inside a tank...

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:37.101
at the pool...

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.187
we cleaned!

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.732
Please, help Lu!

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:47.486
Everybody has Lu all wrong!

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:49.530
You know her...

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:52.366
better than anyone, right?

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:54.618
Lu's a sweet girl...

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.954
<i>and all she wants is to be...</i>

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.747
<i>friends with everyone!</i>

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.124
<i>Please tell everyone...</i>

01:22:00.374 --> 01:22:01.792
<i>the truth...</i>

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.293
<i>about her!</i>

01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:06.171
<i>If you stay between these stone piles,
you won't get snagged.</i>

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.173
<i>Everyone friend, everyone friend!</i>

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.523
Hey, this is my favorite song.

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:25.649
Yep.

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:27.025
How'd you know?

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:31.071
Because the only thing
I ever have on my mind is you!

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:32.197
Kidding!

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.408
The roads are flooding!

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:37.578
Everything is going to flood!
We have to evacuate everyone!

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.122
Thanks, Kunio!

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:42.040
I love you!

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.417
I'm gonna go to where Lu is!

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.585
I'm right behind you!

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:46.003
Sorry, kiddo!

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:47.671
I need you to man the booth!

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:50.257
I have to pick up people in my bus!

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.176
Good job, DJ!

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:55.262
Kai!

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:57.973
Kai, I...

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:03.228
I'm sorry, Yuho.
I've only been thinking of myself.

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:04.605
Thanks for that announcement.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:07.774
I'm gonna rescue Lu. I'll need a hand!

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.944
I won't be able to do anything!
I know it.

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:13.071
That's where you're wrong.
At times like this, you say...

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:17.075
"I'm the type
who can do anything." Right?

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:20.454
Let's move!

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.206
And I dig this song!

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:31.632
- Hey, stop that!
- Let us in! My family owns this building!

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:33.008
Kai!

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.052
He's my son.

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.603
I was just on my way to get you.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.731
You should do what's on your mind.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:50.108
And you should speak
what's on your mind.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:53.487
Don't be afraid of the outcome.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:55.697
Sure, there have been some sad times,

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:58.825
but I don't regret anything
about my life.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:04.873
And besides, the fact that merfolk exist
makes me really happy!

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.167
Yeah!

01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:26.353
Turn this!

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:33.610
Is this thing stuck?

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.280
We can't move it!

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:37.614
Yes, we can!

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:39.825
You kids aren't gonna show us up!

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:15.027
What happened?

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.571
It's them! They opened the sluice gate!

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:31.209
Lu?

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:37.382
The mermaid isn't dead, right?

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:39.384
Papa!Papa!

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:48.518
Papa!Papa!

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:50.937
That was close!

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.815
I thought we were goners for sure!

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:58.028
- Hey, this is nice!
- We were almost burned alive!

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.907
Papa!

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:11.583
Lu!

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:13.835
What the heck?

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:15.462
Get your hands off my son!

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:17.005
- Don't you touch me!
- Cut it out!

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.969
Those lights have the same
properties as sunlight,

01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:25.263
so you can't use those
weird powers of yours!

01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:29.017
Squirt water up at the lights!

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.158
Damn!

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:46.201
They're getting away!

01:26:50.747 --> 01:26:52.916
You're not taking us with you?

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.209
Yuho!

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:58.630
Lu, I'm so sorry. I

01:26:58.714 --> 01:27:00.966
Yuho! Lu! Friends! Friends!

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.509
What a relief!

01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:06.138
Kai! Friend! Friend!

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:11.435
<i>Everybody! The sea is rising
and flooding the town!</i>

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:13.729
<i>Get to high ground!</i>

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:14.688
That idiot!

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:15.814
Stay calm.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.107
Speak slowly...

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:19.317
and with pauses.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.780
Hurry! We have to get after them!

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.949
The water's rising!

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:28.952
<i>The waters...</i>

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.288
<i>are rising...</i>

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:33.623
<i>and the town...</i>

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:34.833
<i>is flooding!</i>

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:38.086
<i>Please remain calm...</i>

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:39.838
<i>and get to...</i>

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:41.882
Take us out right now! Get after them!

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:43.592
- I'm worried about my house!
- My family!

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.344
Nobody gets off this boat!

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:54.394
The town is flooding!

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:57.022
Lu, can't you do anything to stop it?

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:59.775
The merfolk aren't doing this.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.818
It's the curse of the Shadow.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.614
That's why the waters are rising
only inside the wall!

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:09.326
I'm headed towards the school!
Get in, as many as can fit!

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:12.120
Should we leave, too?

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.331
Mum, wake up!

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:17.209
Takashi! Mitsuo!
Get everyone into the truck!

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.836
- What about the PC?
- Won't we lose our files?

01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:23.840
Huh?

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.846
Just as I thought,
it's the curse of the Shadow.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.473
<i>The flooding...</i>

01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:33.475
<i>is limited to...</i>

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:34.851
<i>just Hinashi...</i>

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:36.812
<i>Town!</i>

01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:51.493
There they are!

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.162
Get the nets ready! Catch those merfolk!

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.499
They say the town's flooded
up to floor level!

01:28:57.582 --> 01:28:59.918
- It's the curse!
- The merfolk are angry!

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.962
It's because we captured those merfolk.

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:03.672
Turn the ship around!

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:05.131
We're getting out of here!

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:15.392
What are you doing?

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:22.440
Th-Th-Those monsters!

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:26.111
Grab on, Yuho!

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:33.869
Darn it, hold it still, Granddad!

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:37.622
The one I flew in the Self-Defense
Forces had more propellers!

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:38.748
I'll get out!

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:53.847
Hey, he can swim!

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:57.350
We're all on!

01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:04.316
Lu!

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:06.776
She's trying to help the townspeople!

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.503
Dry land is that way! That way!

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:33.303
It's Granny Octopus! Look out, Lu!

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:34.262
Lu!

01:30:55.492 --> 01:30:56.618
Run, Lu!

01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:08.046
Octopus! Octopus!

01:31:08.338 --> 01:31:09.381
It's me!

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:12.133
It's me. Do you recognize me?

01:31:12.384 --> 01:31:14.177
I got turned into a merman.

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:21.768
Save me!

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:23.728
I'm saved.

01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:28.400
What's going on?

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.111
Thank you.

01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:41.162
Do you see Daddy?

01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:43.748
Help me!

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:45.375
Oh, he's fine.

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:49.379
The merfolk didn't mean any harm.

01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:53.550
I guess it bit me to save my life
when I was drowning.

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:59.556
Why didn't you come to me sooner?

01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:00.890
<i>Come with me now, Octopus.</i>

01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:08.857
Come.

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:20.118
I'm a gosh darn mermaid!

01:32:45.769 --> 01:32:46.895
Do exactly as I say!

01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:50.982
<i>Travel by car...</i>

01:32:52.192 --> 01:32:53.777
<i>is difficult now!</i>

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:56.404
<i>So don't try!</i>

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:58.531
<i>Use boats!</i>

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:00.658
<i>Anyone who has...</i>

01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:03.536
<i>a boat or jet-ski...</i>

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:05.663
<i>please go help!</i>

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:08.333
<i>Please be mindful...</i>

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.502
<i>of the elderly...</i>

01:33:12.003 --> 01:33:13.254
<i>and children!</i>

01:33:14.714 --> 01:33:16.424
<i>Run to the hills, mountains...</i>

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:18.718
<i>or high ground!</i>

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.513
<i>Or even the roofs of buildings!</i>

01:33:23.389 --> 01:33:25.558
- It's the usual girl again.
- Hey! Climb up to us!

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:27.227
If you can swim, come over here!

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.526
Thank goodness!

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:35.735
- Merfolk?
- Bye-bye!

01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:37.195
Look out!

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:40.698
- We're saved!
- Hop in!

01:33:43.827 --> 01:33:46.204
Grandma, where are you?

01:33:46.371 --> 01:33:49.207
I'm fine, they're rescuing me now.

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:51.209
They won't eat us?

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:53.753
I'm scared!

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:02.720
Thank you!

01:34:05.765 --> 01:34:07.684
- I'm exhausted!
- I'm beat!

01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:10.228
- There's no end!
- There's always more.

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:35.879
Lu and her dad are both exhausted.

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:38.089
You've done enough, Lu.

01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:40.508
- Don't worry, everything will be fine.
- Watch your step.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:44.095
It's the morning sun! We have to hurry!

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.598
Granddad, let me off!

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:49.142
Kai, you rally Lu and the others!

01:34:49.392 --> 01:34:52.061
- Chairman, let me out, too!
- Will do!

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:15.710
I've got you!

01:35:16.085 --> 01:35:17.337
Thanks, mister!

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.965
- Yeah, thanks!
- Thanks!

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:22.717
Merfolk?

01:35:36.481 --> 01:35:37.190
What is it?

01:35:39.108 --> 01:35:40.818
Let me do something to help!

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.074
Please take us to Merfolk Island!

01:35:56.834 --> 01:35:58.044
Citizens of Hinashi!

01:35:58.419 --> 01:35:59.712
This is Isaki!

01:36:00.129 --> 01:36:03.466
Please remain calm
and just float where you are!

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:05.927
<i>There are no waves, so don't worry!</i>

01:36:06.177 --> 01:36:07.679
<i>Boats will be there soon!</i>

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:09.472
<i>Merfolk will rescue you!</i>

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:12.433
<i>So please relax and wait for them!</i>

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:19.274
There's no echo here.

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:23.319
This is Yuho!

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.697
The merfolk are here to help!

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.240
They're really nice!

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:28.866
So just relax

01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:31.327
and let them move you!

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:34.998
I promise, they'll come to help!

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.548
Just a little more!

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.759
E-Everything will be fine, Puppy-chan.

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:49.637
A fishing boat will come
to rescue us, okay?

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:53.850
Puppy-chan!
Don't leave me all alone! l...

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:55.184
I can't swim!

01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:57.186
Puppy-Chan!

01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:07.864
Soran! I never meant to abandon you!

01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:12.827
Somebody help me!

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:19.917
Gotcha!

01:37:20.626 --> 01:37:21.544
Up you go!

01:37:46.194 --> 01:37:46.903
There he is!

01:38:05.004 --> 01:38:16.099
<i>Ah, singing a song,
is not the hardest thing to do</i>

01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:23.439
<i>Just let your voice take over you</i>

01:38:24.065 --> 01:38:30.696
<i>and let go of everything</i>

01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:35.368
<i>Ah, when I close my eyes,</i>

01:38:37.453 --> 01:38:41.874
<i>old memories of the days we spent</i>

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:54.178
<i>come back into my mind</i>

01:38:56.681 --> 01:39:00.643
<i>The truth is in the song</i>

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:06.816
<i>Even the things</i>

01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:17.743
<i>that I'm too shy to tell
you face to face</i>

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:22.665
<i>I am a singer and here is the song</i>

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:30.882
<i>that I'm singing with you in my mind</i>

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:35.928
<i>I got something to tell you,</i>

01:39:36.012 --> 01:39:42.226
<i>but I couldn't get myself to tell you
all those times</i>

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:46.814
<i>but now I say to you</i>

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:53.988
<i>I love you</i>

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.595
Lu!

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.057
Thank you.

01:41:45.683 --> 01:41:47.393
Everyone really loves you!

01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:53.816
Um, so do I... I also..

01:41:54.066 --> 01:41:55.318
I love you, too.

01:41:56.569 --> 01:41:58.237
I love you! I love you!

01:41:58.487 --> 01:41:59.530
I totally love you!

01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:00.823
Sol...

01:42:01.365 --> 01:42:02.783
I want you

01:42:02.867 --> 01:42:04.827
to stay with me forever!

01:42:12.668 --> 01:42:14.462
Lu love! Love love!

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:19.050
Kiss love! Lu love! Lu love Kai!

01:42:23.387 --> 01:42:26.349
<i>And now, how about a little tune
as a sign of our friendship?</i>

01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:55.711
With Shadowstone gone, the bay
is no longer fit for the merfolk.

01:43:26.492 --> 01:43:27.368
Lu?

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:33.874
Lu!

01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:43.008
HIKAGE MARU

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:44.385
It's so bright!

01:43:45.594 --> 01:43:46.971
Have a good trip!

01:43:53.185 --> 01:43:54.061
When we got back,

01:43:54.145 --> 01:43:56.188
Mr. Ebina was very generous.

01:43:58.691 --> 01:44:00.317
The short-neck clams are great today!

01:44:00.401 --> 01:44:02.069
I made sure to rinse all the sand out!

01:44:02.153 --> 01:44:04.572
I'm gonna go to a high school
out past the mountains.

01:44:05.364 --> 01:44:07.199
I'm curious about what's out there now.

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:09.160
That's fine.

01:44:09.243 --> 01:44:13.706
But I decided that I'll come back here
someday and be a sailor.

01:44:13.789 --> 01:44:16.417
I want to travel around
and see what other seas are like.

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.294
Places where there might
be merfolk, too.

01:44:18.753 --> 01:44:20.379
Oh, and I wrote a letter to Mum.

01:44:20.838 --> 01:44:22.214
I'm gonna go see her.

01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:23.758
Thanks for breakfast.

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.179
And Dad?

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:30.431
Thank you, I mean it.

01:44:40.816 --> 01:44:41.734
Good morning!

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:42.735
Morning, all!

01:44:44.153 --> 01:44:45.780
Good morning, DJ!

01:44:46.071 --> 01:44:47.281
Back at'cha!

01:44:48.282 --> 01:44:51.076
I decided to apply to a school in Tokyo.

01:44:51.327 --> 01:44:53.454
So I might not be able to play
in the band anymore.

01:44:53.704 --> 01:44:56.040
Sure. Well, try hard.

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.792
Back at'cha!

01:44:58.042 --> 01:45:00.252
- I'll meet you at school!
- Hey, wait a second!

01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:06.634
One last time... We're SEIREN!

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:10.763
- Fight!
- On!

01:45:20.064 --> 01:45:20.856
Hey!

01:45:22.566 --> 01:45:24.610
Things are looking pretty sunny
in this town now, huh?

01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:51.929
<i>Ah, singing a song</i>

01:45:53.889 --> 01:45:59.144
<i>is not the hardest thing to do</i>

01:45:59.478 --> 01:46:05.651
<i>just let your voice take over you</i>

01:46:05.734 --> 01:46:12.658
<i>and let go of everything</i>

01:46:12.741 --> 01:46:17.496
<i>Ah, when I close my eyes</i>

01:46:19.498 --> 01:46:23.878
<i>old memories of the days we spent</i>

01:46:23.961 --> 01:46:35.848
<i>come back into my mind</i>

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:43.063
<i>The truth is in the song</i>

01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:48.611
<i>Even the things</i>

01:46:48.694 --> 01:46:59.580
<i>that I am too shy to tell you
face to face</i>

01:46:59.663 --> 01:47:07.796
<i>I am a singer and here is the song</i>

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:13.344
<i>that I am singing with you in my mind</i>

01:47:13.427 --> 01:47:17.932
<i>I got something to tell you</i>

01:47:18.015 --> 01:47:23.812
<i>But I couldn't get myself to tell you
all those times</i>

01:47:23.896 --> 01:47:27.358
<i>but now I say to you</i>

01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:30.277
<i>I love you</i>

01:47:45.376 --> 01:47:50.089
<i>Ah, singing a song</i>

01:47:52.174 --> 01:47:56.261
<i>is not the hardest thing to do</i>

01:47:57.805 --> 01:48:03.727
<i>just set your heart free</i>

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.358
<i>That's all you have to do</i>

01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:14.947
<i>Grab the words floating in the sky</i>

01:48:17.783 --> 01:48:32.381
<i>We'll take a trip on a melody</i>

01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:37.720
<i>What is beyond the horizon of passion?</i>

01:48:37.803 --> 01:48:45.644
<i>The shadows of the buildings
are shivering</i>

01:48:45.728 --> 01:48:56.530
<i>with their arms crossed
in the cold cold wind</i>

01:48:56.613 --> 01:49:02.536
<i>But let's go find out,
I'm curious to see beyond</i>

01:49:28.479 --> 01:49:32.524
<i>The melody carries on</i>

01:49:34.777 --> 01:49:39.406
<i>It's taking us away</i>

01:49:44.495 --> 01:49:49.792
<i>I'm a singer and here is the song</i>

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:57.508
<i>that I'm singing with you in my mind</i>

01:49:57.674 --> 01:50:01.970
<i>How could I tell you?</i>

01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:13.524
<i>Please be with me on winter mornings
or rainy nights</i>

01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:31.542
<i>I'm singing, picturing a movie
with a happy ending</i>

01:50:31.625 --> 01:50:37.131
<i>Here is a beautiful thing</i>

01:50:37.214 --> 01:50:42.427
<i>I want to say to you</i>

01:50:44.012 --> 01:50:47.891
<i>I love you</i>
