Hello, Vintage Fashion Forum.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.937
I have an emergency on my hands.
Pun intended.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.940
Please help date these gloves, ASAP.

a separate thread for your gloves,

and are clearly Nazi gloves.

As I was saying, we have all been hit
by a lull in sales the past few months.

01:13.198 --> 01:17.368
And I don't think it's a coincidence that
it started when you-know-who showed up.

Spot on again, Gail.

Nasty Girl has sullied the sanctity
of vintage fashion.

Second, this message board should be
called David Lynch's<i> Elephant Man</i>,

01:38.890 --> 01:41.184
because it's full of freaks
and sad as fuck.

She called us freaks.

01:50.693 --> 01:53.655
Even worse, she completely missed
the point of <i>The Elephant Man</i>.

Everybody, stop.

to make fun of us.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.900
Sure. She's your problem now.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.070
Yeah, I don't know. I've been thinking.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.322
I'm not sure about being manager.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.034
It's a big commitment.
A lot more hours, more responsibility.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.161
Since when have you been afraid of work?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.914
Don't you want a shot at an actual career?

11:04.997 --> 11:06.290
Ah, maybe someday.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.211
If I have a career before I get married,
then I become unmarriable.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.754
You don't actually think that.

11:11.837 --> 11:12.713
No. [chuckles]

11:15.299 --> 11:16.384
[sighs]

11:16.467 --> 11:18.511
I'm just afraid that if I become manager,

11:18.594 --> 11:21.055
it'll force me
to give up working at Nasty Gal.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.849
Your friend's eBay store?
What do you even do there?

11:23.933 --> 11:28.020
A lot. I organize the whole office,
I do makeup on all her shoots,

11:28.104 --> 11:29.980
I basically run the PR Department.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.650
It's fun,
and I get to work with my best friend.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.068
I don't wanna give that up.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.654
If that's the case,
why not work at Nasty Gal full-time?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.697
'Cause it's not even,
like, a real job yet.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.199
Sophia doesn't even pay me.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.910
I mean, she totally could.
I've never asked her.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.121
-I should ask her.
-Yeah, you should.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.541
Then again, a career in makeup
has always been my dream.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.543

11:55.464 --> 11:57.508
I bought a ticket and then didn't go.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.594
I always wondered
where my life would be if I'd seen it.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.514
Well, just... think about
what makes you happy.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.391

12:06.851 --> 12:10.229
How about this marketing idea:
free samples at the DMV.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.107
Then every time they look
at their kick-ass driver's license,

12:13.190 --> 12:16.986
they'll say, "Damn,
those products make me look good."

the rules of eBay do state

16:03.003 --> 16:05.673
we should not be linking

I'm totally with Gail on this one.
That is what the rules say.

Glad you called me out. I deserved that.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.185

Apologies.
I know how you dislike getting off-topic,

16:32.741 --> 16:35.911
but I must take back everything I said
about Nasty Gal.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.580
As moderator, I will let it slide.

just had a horrible encounter
with Nasty Gal.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.257
So, I can no longer vouch for her
as a seller or as a person.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.175
This is what I've been saying all along.

earlier and now she's flip-flopping.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.605

This is a safe place in which people
are allowed to change their minds,

especially when it's pointing
out the shortcomings of Nasty Gal.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.780
I just think, again,
as an unbiased observer,

17:11.864 --> 17:14.491
that you're all ganging up on Nasty Gal
for no reason.

17:14.575 --> 17:18.412
Don't know why you're defending Nasty Gal.
She can defend herself.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.373
She can do everything herself.

17:21.457 --> 17:25.919

wouldn't turn to you, Internet stranger.

because you're my friend.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.103
Of course I was.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.689

would want me, your friend,

18:27.773 --> 18:29.441
to be a part of Nasty Gal.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.193

20:46.787 --> 20:49.164
Because I know every second
that you spend thinking about me

20:49.248 --> 20:51.541
comes from a deep-rooted fear
that you'll never be me.

-Okay, enough TimesandTreasures.

to our sites on eBay.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.231

21:56.315 --> 21:58.567
and we shouldn't be
allowed to here either.

that gives me an idea.

the same thing.

What if we all took down our site links
on our eBay listings?
