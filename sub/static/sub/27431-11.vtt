WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:03.379
Previously on Gotham...

00:03.463 --> 00:04.964
General Wade's
landing craft docked.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.591
<i>His convoy's
on the way here now.</i>

00:06.674 --> 00:08.635
<i>Reunification day is today.</i>

00:08.718 --> 00:11.179
- Captain Gordon.
- General, welcome to Gotham.

00:11.262 --> 00:12.263
Incoming!

00:12.347 --> 00:14.015
Get back!

00:14.807 --> 00:18.019
(filtered breathing)

00:23.900 --> 00:26.194
Eduardo.
What did Walker do to you?

00:26.277 --> 00:27.529
Eduardo's dead, Jim.

00:27.612 --> 00:28.947
There is only Bane now.

00:29.030 --> 00:32.909
Everything I have done here
is about punishing Gotham

00:32.992 --> 00:35.370
for the sins
of Bruce Wayne.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.663
I'm not leaving.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.039
And I don't
think I can

00:38.122 --> 00:40.208
let you leave... either.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.417
What are you doing?

00:41.501 --> 00:43.002
(grunting)

00:44.254 --> 00:45.922
Ra's al Ghul.

00:46.005 --> 00:46.756
This is revenge

00:46.839 --> 00:47.882
for his death.

00:47.966 --> 00:48.967
And who am I?

00:49.050 --> 00:50.093
You're his daughter.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.928
(grunting)

00:52.011 --> 00:54.097
(shouting)

00:55.181 --> 00:56.474
Barbara Kean.

00:56.558 --> 00:57.850
Run!

00:57.934 --> 01:00.103
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

01:00.186 --> 01:02.063
Ibefieve
you knew my father.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.398
- Where's Nyssa?
- I don't know,

01:03.481 --> 01:04.440
but she's planning
on using the military

01:04.524 --> 01:05.441
to wipe out Gotham.

01:05.525 --> 01:06.943
I can order them to stand down.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.027
Then let's get you
out of here.

01:10.196 --> 01:11.447
This is General Wade.

01:11.531 --> 01:12.699
Begin your
bombing run

01:12.782 --> 01:13.783
-on my order.
- Wait, wait.

01:17.704 --> 01:20.540
(explosions in distance)

01:21.624 --> 01:23.543
(helicopter blades whirring)

01:23.626 --> 01:25.545
(indistinct chatter)

01:38.683 --> 01:40.852
GORDON:
We need to get a hold of Barbara.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.478
Nyssa al Ghul's coming for her.

01:42.562 --> 01:44.981
The sooner she and Lee get back
here with the baby, the better.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.608
LUCIUS: We got refugees coming
in from all over Gotham, Jim.

01:46.691 --> 01:47.734
People are scared.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.319
I know you're
not one to quit,

01:49.402 --> 01:51.112
but if there was ever a time
to wave the white flag,

01:51.195 --> 01:52.196
now is it.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.283
Nyssa al Ghul doesn't want
to just conquer Gotham--

01:55.366 --> 01:56.826
she wants to destroy it,

01:56.909 --> 01:58.453
kill everyone she finds.

01:58.536 --> 02:01.456
The only thing standing between
her and these people is us.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.124
Gather the team.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.792
Get every able-bodied refugee

02:04.876 --> 02:07.545
down into the bunkers
beneath the GCPD.

02:07.629 --> 02:09.964
Why do I get the feeling
he's concocting

02:10.048 --> 02:12.383
an elaborate plan
to get us all killed?

02:12.467 --> 02:15.345
Better gather up
these refugees.

02:19.098 --> 02:22.018
Look at him.

02:22.101 --> 02:25.229
The medics did everything
they could to stabilize him.

02:26.606 --> 02:29.734
Now all we can do is wait.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.112
This is my fault.

02:36.074 --> 02:38.534
I sent him on this mission.

02:38.618 --> 02:41.371
Alfred knew what he
was signing up for, Bruce.

02:41.454 --> 02:43.414
We all did.

02:43.498 --> 02:46.751
Nyssa and Bane
are coming after me and Barbara.

02:47.377 --> 02:49.420
Coming after Gotham.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.424
Because of what
we did to Ra's.

02:54.384 --> 02:56.928
What you did was stop him.

02:58.096 --> 02:59.555
Twice.

03:00.139 --> 03:03.184
We'll stop his psycho
daughter together.

03:11.109 --> 03:14.070
I'm sure you
recognize this knife.

03:15.571 --> 03:16.906
You touch my baby,

03:16.989 --> 03:18.491
and I will turn you
into a pile of ash,

03:18.574 --> 03:20.326
just like I did your father.

03:20.410 --> 03:23.871
A bit cruel, don't you think?

03:23.955 --> 03:26.165
To let this little one
get too attached

03:26.249 --> 03:27.667
when you won't be around

03:27.750 --> 03:28.835
much longer.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.211
(shudders)
Mmm.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.963
(cooing)

03:32.046 --> 03:34.382
Soon, you and Bruce Wayne

03:34.465 --> 03:36.217
will see Gotham

03:36.300 --> 03:40.513
and Jim Gordon's precious
Green Zone destroyed.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.850
Then I'll allow you to die.

03:43.933 --> 03:47.770
My father made his name
destroying empires.

03:47.854 --> 03:50.648
Now it's my turn.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.361
(panting)
Hello.

03:55.445 --> 03:57.613
Listen to me.
There is a submarine

03:57.697 --> 03:59.449
in the docks,
full of Gotham's gold.

03:59.532 --> 04:00.616
It's yours.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.744
Just leave the city.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.412
Let me and my baby go.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.540
(cooing)
No.

04:07.623 --> 04:11.210
I think I'll keep
this little one

04:11.294 --> 04:14.297
and raise her as my own.

04:16.007 --> 04:17.341
As an al Ghul.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.926
(laughing)

04:22.180 --> 04:24.098
I take it the army has landed.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.933
They're just awaiting
my orders.

04:26.017 --> 04:28.019
Then what are you waiting for?

04:31.731 --> 04:35.359
What a cute
little baby.

04:36.486 --> 04:38.404
(indistinct chatter)

04:49.457 --> 04:50.541
Wait, what?

04:50.625 --> 04:52.543
You're ordering us to destroy
the Green Zone?

04:52.627 --> 04:55.338
Anyone still in Gotham
is an enemy of the state.

04:55.421 --> 04:57.465
I won't be party to the murder
of civilians, General.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.259
Then you're relieved
of command.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.094
The hell are you?

05:02.178 --> 05:03.262
(filtered breathing)

05:03.346 --> 05:04.722
I'm your new commander.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.058
(snap)

05:07.141 --> 05:10.895
Does anybody else have a problem
with the general's orders?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.105
Good.

05:13.189 --> 05:15.483
Let's get started.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.902
<i>HTS'</i>

05:29.539 --> 05:31.123
What's the matter?

05:31.207 --> 05:35.127
Can we really be so cavalier
about the destruction of Gotham?

05:35.211 --> 05:37.672
(sighs)
Let me think about that.

05:37.755 --> 05:38.631
Yes!

05:38.714 --> 05:40.508
(groans)

05:40.591 --> 05:41.801
Damn it!

05:41.884 --> 05:43.803
Oswald!

05:43.886 --> 05:45.054
Where are you going?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.722
Oswald!

05:46.806 --> 05:48.933
This is my city,
and I will be damned

05:49.016 --> 05:50.893
if I'm gonna let
those bastards take it!

05:50.977 --> 05:52.395
I cannot let you do this.

05:52.478 --> 05:53.813
You, of all people,

05:53.896 --> 05:56.357
should want to stop
those monsters.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.943
They forced you
to destroy Haven,

05:59.026 --> 06:00.945
to murder hundreds
of innocent civilians.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.072
You're just gonna let
'em get away with it?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.740
I was kind of planning on it,
yeah.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.909
Very well.

06:06.993 --> 06:09.161
I'm going to follow my heart.

06:09.829 --> 06:10.997
Oswald!

06:12.790 --> 06:14.458
You have been down
this road before.

06:15.418 --> 06:18.421
Following your heart has
never worked out for you.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.300
Perhaps.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.926
But perhaps
you could learn something

06:24.010 --> 06:26.137
if you listened
to this

06:26.220 --> 06:28.014
instead of this.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.934
I'm gonna miss you,

06:32.018 --> 06:34.353
Edward.
(crying)

06:34.437 --> 06:36.022
I'll miss you, too, Oswald.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.775
I'm not talking to you.

06:39.859 --> 06:41.110
I'm talking to the...

06:41.193 --> 06:42.570
God!

06:42.653 --> 06:44.655
(chuckles)
Come on, baby.

06:44.739 --> 06:46.407
All right.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.533
Okay.

06:47.617 --> 06:48.910
Good boy.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.874
(panting)

06:54.957 --> 06:56.459
Go with the man
in green.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.752
(shuddering inhale)

06:57.835 --> 06:59.712
You'll be safe.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.798
Oswald, if you
walk off this dock,

07:02.882 --> 07:04.675
I'm taking this submarine.
(sniffles, exhales)

07:04.759 --> 07:06.677
And the treasure!

07:06.761 --> 07:08.679
Nyssa al Ghul wants
to kill everyone in Gotham.

07:08.763 --> 07:12.433
But, to get to us, the army has
to follow the Western Corridor.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.684
That's where we make a stand.

07:13.768 --> 07:14.769
We got a handful of men.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.729
How are we gonna
take on an army?

07:16.812 --> 07:18.814
We just have to slow
the army down long enough

07:18.898 --> 07:21.150
to get General Wade out
from under Nyssa's control.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.944
Then he can reverse
the invasion order.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.279
We're trying
to reach the Sirens.

07:25.363 --> 07:26.238
Still no luck.

07:26.322 --> 07:28.240
All right. I'll go.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.659
Jim.

07:29.742 --> 07:30.910
I need to get Barbara
and Lee back here.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.079
I'll meet you at the barricades.
I know you haven't seen

07:33.162 --> 07:35.665
your kid yet,
but the GCPD needs a leader,

07:35.748 --> 07:37.249
and they're looking to you.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.417
I'll go to Sirens.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.127
Okay.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.548
(siren wailing in distance)

07:47.343 --> 07:49.637
You sure
you want to do this?

07:49.720 --> 07:52.181
It doesn't take two of us
to track the general's signal.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.600
And if Jim's making a stand,
that's where I should be.

07:54.684 --> 07:55.935
Okay.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.062
Wayne Enterprises EMP,

07:58.145 --> 08:00.815
smoke bombs,
signal jammers.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.025
Not enough to even the odds,
but...

08:03.109 --> 08:04.443
it may buy you some time.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.153
What's this?

08:06.237 --> 08:09.490
Ah. Remember
the Nightwing Project?

08:09.573 --> 08:12.159
Portable, next-gen stealth tech.

08:12.243 --> 08:15.037
Put it on any aircraft,
and it's invisible to radar.

08:15.121 --> 08:17.248
But, unfortunately, it also
seems to serve as a beacon

08:17.331 --> 08:19.375
to certain animals.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.584
Never know.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.669
Might find a use for it.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.218
Oswald, come in.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.012
(chuckles)

08:31.095 --> 08:33.889
Still have those eyes in
the back of your head, Jim.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.640
No.
(sighs)

08:35.725 --> 08:38.977
You just have
a remarkably recognizable odor.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.731
Part dandy,
part snake.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.899
After all these years,
it hasn't changed.

08:43.982 --> 08:44.984
Drink?

08:45.067 --> 08:46.902
No, thank you.

08:46.986 --> 08:49.155
Dulls the senses.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.656
That's what I was going for.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.285
Surprised
you're still here.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.412
Figured you'd be
long gone by now.

08:56.495 --> 09:00.458
That storm you've warned me
about for so long,

09:00.541 --> 09:02.626
it's finally here.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.966
We've shared
some turbulent times, you and I.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.968
That we have.

09:11.052 --> 09:13.429
When you spared my life
on the pier that day,

09:13.512 --> 09:16.015
banished me from Gotham,

09:16.098 --> 09:18.559
that was the most lost
I've ever been.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.019
(chuckles)

09:20.102 --> 09:22.521
Because I was away
from the city, you see.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.647
(chuckles)

09:24.648 --> 09:27.234
It's part of me.

09:27.318 --> 09:28.986
You know what I'm talking about,

09:29.070 --> 09:30.738
because it's part
of you, too.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.406
(chuckles)

09:32.490 --> 09:33.991
Sure, I could escape--

09:34.075 --> 09:35.159
with money, I might add--

09:35.242 --> 09:37.161
but then what?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.829
Stand on the shores
of the mainland

09:38.913 --> 09:41.415
and watch the army burn it
to the ground?

09:41.499 --> 09:44.085
Then watch tasteless
industrialists

09:44.168 --> 09:46.921
and vapid politicians
rebuild it?

09:47.004 --> 09:48.005
(chuckles)

09:48.089 --> 09:49.757
No.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.302
My life is etched on the walls
of every alley

09:53.385 --> 09:55.513
and dirty warehouse here.

09:55.596 --> 10:00.059
My blood lives
in its broken concrete.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.438
I'm staying to fight.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.857
For my legacy-

10:06.941 --> 10:08.150
BULLOCK:
Hey.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.945
The army just busted
through the GCPD checkpoint.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.947
They're heading
to the barricades.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.281
Bane's leading them.

10:14.365 --> 10:15.407
How many men?

10:15.491 --> 10:17.118
(sighs)
600, 700?

10:17.201 --> 10:19.328
- Still want to fight?
-(9ulp$)

10:19.411 --> 10:20.871
How many do we have?

10:20.955 --> 10:21.789
Maybe so?

10:21.872 --> 10:22.706
Flaughs)

10:22.790 --> 10:24.375
Thirty-one.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.837
Takes two men to pilot
that submarine, Oswald.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.921
The dog can't do it.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.172
(exhales)

10:30.256 --> 10:32.800
Ditto on that blood
and concrete thing.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.803
Kind of like this city
the way it is.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.596
Shall we?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.390
Ibefieve
time is of the essence.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.142
Gentlemen.

10:41.225 --> 10:44.061
Remind me to talk to you
about that full pardon.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.024
<i>HTS'</i>

11:12.381 --> 11:14.091
Alvarez!

11:14.175 --> 11:15.843
Harper, Bruce!

11:15.926 --> 11:17.636
You take the left flank.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.346
Harvey and I will
take the right.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.682
Holy Mary, Mother and Joseph.

11:26.020 --> 11:28.147
BANE:
Captain Gordon...

11:28.230 --> 11:30.774
I always knew you had
a savior complex,

11:30.858 --> 11:32.568
but this is too much.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.904
What happened to you, Eduardo?

11:34.987 --> 11:36.572
There was a time
when you would have been up

11:36.655 --> 11:38.157
on these barricades with me.

11:38.240 --> 11:43.120
Yes... but that was before
I found my true purpose.

11:43.204 --> 11:45.581
Stand by.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.250
Fire on my command.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.461
Jim, it's a lot
of innocent soldiers

11:50.544 --> 11:52.254
down there
just following orders.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.841
Target Bane
and Nyssa's commandos.

11:55.925 --> 11:56.967
Fire on my command.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.720
For Gotham.

12:12.066 --> 12:14.109
(groans)

12:14.193 --> 12:16.111
SEUNA:
Lee?

12:16.195 --> 12:17.780
(gunfire in distance)

12:17.863 --> 12:19.114
Selina.

12:19.198 --> 12:21.909
Hey. Come on, we got
to get out of here.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.453
Where's Barbara
and the baby?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.622
(exhales)
Nyssa al Ghul took them.

12:26.705 --> 12:27.915
We have to tell Jim.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.208
Yeah.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.210
(gunfire continues)

12:33.921 --> 12:36.465
The Narrows.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.681
They never stood
a chance.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.434
The ones who could
escaped to the GCPD.

12:47.518 --> 12:49.812
Then that's where
I'm needed.

12:54.692 --> 12:56.151
(grunts)

13:02.283 --> 13:03.826
(grenade whistling)

13:06.787 --> 13:08.330
- Target Jim Gordon.
-(grunts)

13:08.414 --> 13:10.332
I'm sorry! I don't
think he can hear you

13:10.416 --> 13:12.042
through the bullet
in his ear!

13:12.126 --> 13:13.585
(groans)

13:17.464 --> 13:18.841
Eddie!

13:19.842 --> 13:22.469
(screaming)

13:24.555 --> 13:26.724
They're only delaying
the inevitable.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.436
Jim, that thing's
pointing right at us!

13:33.939 --> 13:35.441
(groans)

13:35.524 --> 13:37.067
BANE:
Go, go, go, go, go!

13:41.864 --> 13:44.992
Find me Jim Gordon
and Bruce Wayne.

13:46.035 --> 13:47.328
If the army gets through
the barricades,

13:47.411 --> 13:49.538
they'll have a straight shot to
the GCPD and the people there.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.749
We need to find another way
to slow them down.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.459
I think I have a way.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.962
GORDON: Gather all the
ammunition you can.

13:57.046 --> 13:58.964
Fall back to the GCPD.

13:59.048 --> 14:00.424
Go, go now!

14:00.507 --> 14:01.633
Fall back!

14:01.717 --> 14:03.510
We got to go.
(grunts)

14:14.313 --> 14:16.482
Well, that was a disaster.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.734
Come on, Oswald,
we have to keep moving.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.779
Where? There's
nowhere to hide, Jim.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.948
Wherever we go,
the army will find us.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.033
<i>LUCIUS (over radio):
Get me Gordon.</i>

14:26.116 --> 14:27.576
It's Lucius.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.496
Tell me you were able
to track the general's signal.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.748
It's coming from City Hall,
but there's a problem.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.375
Selina radioed.

14:34.458 --> 14:38.087
<i>Barbara and the baby were
kidnapped by Nyssa al Ghul.</i>

14:38.170 --> 14:39.755
General Wade's at City Hall.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.216
Chances are Nyssa, Barbara
and the baby are, too.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.802
Our best bet is for me to sneak
into City Hall alone.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.471
One good electrical zap should
short out the general's chip,

14:47.554 --> 14:49.556
then you can get him
to reverse the invasion order.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.267
See you back at the GCPD.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.728
Get Barbara and
the baby back safe.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.730
Come on. Hey, move!

14:57.481 --> 14:59.441
Upsy-daisy, Oswald.
(Oswald grunting)

14:59.525 --> 15:00.984
We're running
out of time.

15:01.068 --> 15:04.530
(gasps)
Just give me one minute.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.032
I'm so sorry.

15:07.116 --> 15:09.827
I saw the grenade and I froze.
(exhales)

15:09.910 --> 15:11.453
<i>I'm sot...
Shh.</i>

15:12.538 --> 15:15.040
It's the least I could do.

15:16.959 --> 15:17.960
But tell me...

15:20.170 --> 15:22.464
Does it look bad?

15:24.675 --> 15:26.635
No, it's just
a scr... (gags)

15:26.718 --> 15:28.554
Looks fine. Let's go.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.432
Where'd everybody go?

15:31.515 --> 15:33.642
She's gonna need some morphine.

15:33.725 --> 15:34.726
(explosion)

15:34.810 --> 15:37.938
And this bandage needs changing.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.898
Lee.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.024
Bruce.
ls Jim...?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.985
He's okay. For now.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.028
We'll need to get Jeremiah's
battery from the basement.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.407
After the bridges went down,
Lucius re-modified

15:48.490 --> 15:51.285
Jeremiah's bomb to be used
for its original purpose...

15:51.994 --> 15:53.328
as a battery.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.038
It's been powering
the GCPD.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.540
Right.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.792
We need to make
it a bomb again.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.502
You got to be kidding me.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.046
Jeremiah knew exactly
where to put his bombs

16:03.130 --> 16:05.340
to topple buildings,
turn Gotham into a maze.

16:05.424 --> 16:06.758
We stopped him.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.802
But if we could use
just part of his plan,

16:08.886 --> 16:10.804
we can trap the army
and slow them down.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.764
By knocking buildings down
like dominos.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.476
But for that to work, we need
to put a bomb in this building.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.936
Ground Zero for the blast.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.688
Wayne Enterprises.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.231
Bruce...

16:23.108 --> 16:24.568
There's no other way.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.030
Okay. How do we get
this thing out of here?

16:28.113 --> 16:30.115
To use it as a bomb,
you don't need the whole thing.

16:30.199 --> 16:33.869
All you need is... the core...

16:35.537 --> 16:37.206
and the activator.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.208
(electricity powering down)

16:41.001 --> 16:42.211
That's it?

16:42.294 --> 16:43.587
It may look modest,

16:43.670 --> 16:45.214
but all it took was one of these

16:45.297 --> 16:46.548
to blow up an
entire bridge.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.133
Not to mention the
Gotham Clock Tower.

16:48.217 --> 16:50.010
Bruce, you can't
do this alone.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.470
He's not alone.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.388
I know where to place the bomb.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.307
And you and Lucius
are needed here.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.608
I can't believe
we're letting them do this.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.693
Add that to the list

17:06.777 --> 17:09.738
of things that I cannot
believe are happening.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.374
Hey.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.000
What?

17:22.792 --> 17:24.670
(grunting)

17:24.752 --> 17:25.837
(snap)

17:29.424 --> 17:31.051
BARBARA:
The key's there.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.766
Where is she? Is she okay?

17:37.849 --> 17:38.934
Yeah, she's upstairs
in the office

17:39.017 --> 17:41.270
with Nyssa and
the general.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.564
Nyssa is not gonna stop until
she's killed everyone in Gotham.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.567
One thing at a time,
let's go save our baby.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.069
NYSSA:
Hello, Captain Gordon.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.697
(guns cocking)

17:52.531 --> 17:53.949
Ah.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.786
You're seeing your baby
for the first time.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.079
(sighs)

17:59.162 --> 18:01.290
I wish I had a camera.

18:01.373 --> 18:02.374
Hand her over.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.417
No.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.670
I don't think I will.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.672
Put down your guns.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.968
Unless you want the little
one hurt in the crossfire.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.596
(chuckles)

18:18.724 --> 18:21.852
Even now, the army is making
its way to the Green Zone

18:21.935 --> 18:24.855
while Bane is hunting down
Bruce Wayne.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.773
Only question is,

18:26.857 --> 18:29.109
what to do with you?

18:34.364 --> 18:36.575
This is it.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.201
The bomb will weaken
the support column

18:38.285 --> 18:40.537
and topple the
entire building.

18:40.621 --> 18:42.247
This is crazy.

18:42.331 --> 18:45.292
I mean, we've spent this entire
time trying to stop Jeremiah

18:45.375 --> 18:47.210
and now we're actually using
part of his plan.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.131
Believe me...

18:51.214 --> 18:53.550
if there was any other way...

18:55.093 --> 18:56.595
SELINA:
You sure you want to do this?

18:57.387 --> 18:59.848
First Wayne Manor gets destroyed

18:59.931 --> 19:02.142
and now Wayne Enterprises.

19:02.225 --> 19:05.062
This building is the heart
of my family's company.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.647
There are things above us

19:06.730 --> 19:10.609
my parents spent
their entire lives on.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.527
Some of my earliest memories

19:12.611 --> 19:14.196
are playing with Alfred
in this lobby,

19:14.279 --> 19:16.448
waiting for my parents
to come down these escalators.

19:17.491 --> 19:19.034
But my parents
built this company

19:19.117 --> 19:21.286
to make Gotham a better place.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.875
They would have sacrificed
everything for this city.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.920
They did sacrifice
everything.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.760
And if that's what it takes...

19:40.597 --> 19:42.933
...so will I.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.894
(exhales)

19:45.977 --> 19:48.230
SELINA: So remind
me how this works.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.941
Pulls energy from the air
and magnifies it.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.820
And when it does that?

19:54.903 --> 19:56.446
We run!

20:17.259 --> 20:19.344
(clamoring)

20:21.471 --> 20:23.765
(screaming)

20:27.102 --> 20:29.020
<i>N' N'</i>

20:38.029 --> 20:40.782
I knew you'd come
for your child.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.826
I just didn't think
you'd be foolish enough

20:42.909 --> 20:44.536
to come alone.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.288
I don't need help
to take you down.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.999
Don't you see?

20:49.082 --> 20:50.917
It's over.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.544
Gotham will burn.

20:52.627 --> 20:55.505
And I'll achieve
what my father couldn't.

20:55.589 --> 20:58.300
Including killing you.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.093
(chuckles)

21:00.177 --> 21:02.679
She likes to be held upright.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.639
(baby cooing)
There.

21:05.849 --> 21:09.394
Barbara, I'll deal with you
once Gotham has been destroyed.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.731
But I'd like you
to see this.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.318
(both grunting)

21:28.205 --> 21:30.582
I was expecting
a little more gusto.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.292
You want gusto?

21:33.293 --> 21:35.796
(bOth grunt)

21:37.547 --> 21:39.007
Is that all you got?
(radio beeping)

21:40.383 --> 21:43.094
It's Lieutenant Angel.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.599
They did what?

21:47.682 --> 21:49.518
No, no.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.645
Is there another
way around?

21:51.728 --> 21:53.605
Then tell the army

21:53.688 --> 21:55.148
to blast through.

21:55.232 --> 21:56.983
GORDON:
Hey.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.361
I'm not done with you yet.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.822
Your friends
may have bought you some time,

22:01.905 --> 22:04.574
but the Green Zone's destruction
is only delayed.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.744
And now to meet your fate.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.871
(handcuffs close)
Let's meet it together.

22:11.206 --> 22:12.582
(grunting)

22:12.666 --> 22:13.667
Barbara!

22:13.750 --> 22:15.043
(Gordon screams)

22:17.045 --> 22:17.796
(gunfire)

22:17.879 --> 22:18.630
Shoot him.

22:19.422 --> 22:20.590
No.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.426
(grunting)

22:29.015 --> 22:30.725
You think you can defeat me?

22:30.809 --> 22:33.311
Better men and women
have tried and failed.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.188
(grunting)

22:37.482 --> 22:38.733
(shouts)

22:42.362 --> 22:43.738
I'm an al Ghul.

22:43.822 --> 22:47.117
You'll never beat me; I have
my father's blood in my veins.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.994
I am his one true heir.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.787
Do you ever stop talking?

22:53.915 --> 22:54.916
(cries out)

22:55.000 --> 22:57.377
You two do share
one thing.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.424
You both love getting
stabbed by this knife.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.050
General Wade.

23:05.927 --> 23:08.638
Execute fail-safe.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.393
No.

23:21.026 --> 23:24.988
I'm going to enjoy watching
Gotham be destroyed!

23:25.071 --> 23:27.949
And then my legacy
will be complete.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.085
We got to hurry.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.254
It's only a matter of time
before the army breaks through.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.589
We need to get back to the GCPD.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.507
-(grunts)
- Bruce!

23:45.634 --> 23:48.094
Impressive. You blew up
your father's building

23:48.178 --> 23:49.721
to stop the military.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.097
It will take more
to stop me.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.182
Go on ahead, Selina!

23:52.265 --> 23:53.350
Warn the GCPD!

23:53.433 --> 23:55.477
No, we're doing this
together.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.250
You shouldn't have hurt Alfred.

24:19.334 --> 24:23.004
Collateral damage.
It happens in war.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.845
I'm sorry you weren't there
to see me break your butler,

24:30.929 --> 24:33.556
but I'm so glad you won't miss
me killing your little friend.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.642
Let her go.

24:35.725 --> 24:38.019
In war, there are
no attachments.

24:38.103 --> 24:40.021
Only then can you fight
without your hands tied.

24:40.105 --> 24:44.359
You see... just a little ounce
of pressure.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.653
That's all that separates
the living from the dead.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.530
(shouts)
(cries out)

24:51.574 --> 24:54.160
(device beeping)

24:54.244 --> 24:55.495
SELINA:
What is that?

24:55.578 --> 24:57.247
BRUCE: Wayne cloaking device,
but it had some glitches.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.874
Apparently, it's a beacon
for certain winged mammals.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.209
SELINA:
What winged mammals?

25:01.292 --> 25:02.585
(wings flapping)

25:02.669 --> 25:04.587
(squealing)

25:06.297 --> 25:07.757
Bats.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.013
(pained grunting)

25:39.581 --> 25:41.541
There's no way to reverse
the invasion order.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.460
We have to find another way.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.670
- Is she all right?
- She is now.

25:45.754 --> 25:48.590
There, there. Mama's here.
(baby cooing)

25:53.386 --> 25:55.221
And your father.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.477
Try not to get blood on her.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.669
Sir...
-(rasping): Come on.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.713
We're almost at the Green Zone.

26:28.797 --> 26:31.132
(mask whirring and clicking)

26:31.216 --> 26:33.968
(hisses)

26:34.052 --> 26:36.262
(breathing steadily)

26:39.015 --> 26:40.016
Lee?

26:41.392 --> 26:42.769
Jim.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.729
The baby? I checked
her over, she's fine.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.106
Though she could use a feed.

26:46.189 --> 26:48.441
(baby cooing)

26:48.525 --> 26:50.652
Where's General Wade?
The army's broken through.

26:50.735 --> 26:52.278
General Wade's dead.

26:52.362 --> 26:54.280
Nyssa al Ghul escaped.
There's no way

26:54.364 --> 26:55.740
to order the army to stand down.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.534
So, now what?

26:57.617 --> 27:00.203
The army blew up
Wayne Enterprises

27:00.286 --> 27:02.831
and knocked down
two other buildings.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.499
We don't stand a chance.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.334
Actually, that was
Bruce and Selina.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.836
What?

27:07.919 --> 27:09.379
The army's blocks away.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.297
GORDON: From what direction?
Every direction.

27:11.381 --> 27:12.382
We're surrounded.

27:13.424 --> 27:16.302
Jim. I need to get her
out of here.

27:16.386 --> 27:19.848
All right. The tunnels
underneath the GCPD.

27:19.931 --> 27:22.642
There's a vent shaft, it
connects to the subway line.

27:22.725 --> 27:26.271
Take the baby and the refugees
down into the subways.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.897
Get 'em behind enemy lines.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.816
- Don't stop till you get to safety.
- Okay.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.860
But what about you?

27:33.486 --> 27:36.531
We'll hold 'em off outside,
buy you some time.

27:36.614 --> 27:37.866
- Jim...
- These refugees,

27:37.949 --> 27:39.159
most of them are
from the Narrows.

27:39.242 --> 27:40.577
They know you, they trust you.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.495
They know you'll
protect them.

27:44.164 --> 27:45.665
Go.

27:54.716 --> 27:58.011
Oh, there you are,
Master Bruce.

27:58.094 --> 28:00.138
Rest, Alfred.

28:01.264 --> 28:04.267
All this time,
I tried to protect you.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.395
Here you are,
a soldier.

28:07.979 --> 28:11.024
A soldier for good.

28:11.107 --> 28:13.985
You've spent your life
protecting me.

28:14.611 --> 28:17.113
Now it's time for me
to do the same.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.908
It's time for me
to protect Gotham.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.452
Even if there's nothing left
to defend.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.006
All right, everyone,
let's move. Okay.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.508
All right, you'll walk
about five blocks underground,

28:37.592 --> 28:40.553
and then you'll get
to a subway vent. Go.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.391
You're not coming with us?

28:45.475 --> 28:47.769
Jim and our friends are
out there making a stand.

28:47.852 --> 28:48.895
That's where I belong.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.605
Wait, what are we going
to do without you?

28:50.688 --> 28:55.109
Survive. Make sure this
was all worth it. Go.

29:01.991 --> 29:03.368
What was that for?

29:03.451 --> 29:05.078
Everything you've done
for me.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.913
And for her.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.957
Just get them to safety.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.193
It's over, Jim.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.904
Our war's come to an end.

29:39.988 --> 29:44.200
This isn't a war.
This is a firing squad.

29:47.954 --> 29:48.997
I told you to go.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.331
And I didn't listen.

29:50.415 --> 29:51.791
Ready.

29:51.874 --> 29:52.875
(panting)

29:52.959 --> 29:55.586
Aim.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.588
(rifles cocking)

30:00.174 --> 30:02.385
MAN:
Shoulder to shoulder.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.012
- Stand together.
- What the...?

30:09.142 --> 30:10.852
They're here for us, Jim.

30:21.279 --> 30:22.864
Fire.

30:22.947 --> 30:24.699
(crowd quiets)

30:27.076 --> 30:29.537
I said fire!

30:29.620 --> 30:31.080
GORDON:
You have a choice.

30:31.706 --> 30:35.793
You can stand with us,
or you can stand with them.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.857
(crowd cheering)

31:11.037 --> 31:13.790
CROWD (chanting):
We are Gotham!

31:13.873 --> 31:16.876
We are Gotham! We are Gotham!

31:20.922 --> 31:23.007
(coughing)

31:29.472 --> 31:33.643
So that bitch was telling
the truth after all.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.066
(dog barking)

31:50.827 --> 31:52.578
LUCIUS: We managed to raise
the mainland on the radio.

31:52.662 --> 31:54.163
They know everything.
As of right now,

31:54.247 --> 31:55.832
the army's being repurposed

31:55.915 --> 31:58.126
for the humanitarian mission
of rebuilding Gotham.

31:58.209 --> 32:01.337
These refugees will get food,
water, medical treatment.

32:01.421 --> 32:03.673
They're setting up a crisis
center in Federal Square.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.633
I'll be damned.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.593
Hey.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.681
So...

32:12.265 --> 32:13.891
this whole
"not listening" thing.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.601
It's not gonna become
a habit, is it?

32:16.561 --> 32:18.020
You're welcome.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.155
Go.

32:34.579 --> 32:36.164
(chuckles softly)

32:36.247 --> 32:37.373
Well, this is gonna make

32:37.457 --> 32:40.543
one hell of a bedtime story
some day.

32:41.586 --> 32:43.212
Can I?

32:43.296 --> 32:45.548
Of course.

32:50.428 --> 32:53.097
I don't even know
what to call her.

32:53.181 --> 32:54.932
Barbara.

32:56.809 --> 32:57.810
Oh.

32:58.561 --> 33:00.980
Barbara Lee Gordon.

33:01.063 --> 33:04.734
In this city, it's important
she know who she can rely on.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.903
(cooing)

33:20.750 --> 33:22.418
Bruce, what's wrong?

33:27.548 --> 33:29.050
We won.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.802
Nyssa al Ghul is
still out there.

33:31.886 --> 33:34.972
And she and Bane
were right.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.475
All this happened
because of me,

33:37.558 --> 33:39.435
because people were
trying to hurt me

33:39.519 --> 33:41.687
and the people
I care about.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.899
When Bane had you...

33:47.235 --> 33:48.653
I thought he was
gonna kill you, Selina,

33:48.736 --> 33:50.696
and there was nothing
I could do.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.032
Hey.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.992
I will be here

33:55.076 --> 33:56.953
whenever you need me.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.666
What?

34:02.708 --> 34:05.586
That's what my parents
used to tell me.

34:07.255 --> 34:08.755
Come here.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.306
That bitch stole
our submarine!

34:18.391 --> 34:19.475
And our gold.

34:19.559 --> 34:21.268
And by now she's probably landed

34:21.351 --> 34:23.938
somewhere on the mainland,
impossible to track!

34:24.021 --> 34:26.107
After all we've been through
these last months,

34:26.190 --> 34:28.484
we are once again left
with nothing!

34:28.568 --> 34:29.902
Nothing!

34:29.985 --> 34:30.987
(grunts)

34:31.070 --> 34:33.656
Back to square one.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.116
Common criminals.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.827
We saved this city
from certain damnation,

34:37.909 --> 34:40.288
but will we see any
credit for our loyalty,

34:40.371 --> 34:41.871
our selfless bravery?

34:41.956 --> 34:43.081
Of course not!

34:43.165 --> 34:44.625
I don't want their thanks.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.877
(panting)

34:46.960 --> 34:48.920
Or their respect.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.632
You know what I felt,

34:51.716 --> 34:55.177
standing shoulder to shoulder
with those people out there?

34:59.265 --> 35:00.891
Nothing.

35:02.893 --> 35:04.478
'III

35:04.562 --> 35:06.272
feel...

35:07.064 --> 35:09.817
absolutely nothing

35:09.900 --> 35:12.737
for those drab...

35:13.613 --> 35:15.364
boring people.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.992
That was me once.

35:18.576 --> 35:21.412
Minimum wage
at a thankless job

35:21.495 --> 35:22.747
at the GCPD.

35:22.830 --> 35:23.914
"Yes, sir. No, sir.

35:23.998 --> 35:26.125
Thank you so much, sir."

35:26.709 --> 35:29.462
Picking up scraps
from my master's floor.

35:29.545 --> 35:32.214
Shy, awkward...

35:32.298 --> 35:35.092
pathetic Ed.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.226
Common criminals?

35:45.853 --> 35:47.813
Never again.

35:48.481 --> 35:52.109
I've shown this city
who I truly am once before,

35:52.193 --> 35:54.278
and I will do it again.

35:54.362 --> 35:56.947
They will bow

35:57.031 --> 35:59.325
to the Riddler,
and they won't get up

35:59.408 --> 36:03.120
until I permit them to.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.081
Yes.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.083
You're right.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.377
Our accomplishments
have been erased,

36:09.460 --> 36:12.463
our brilliant minds
underrated.

36:12.546 --> 36:15.299
If they had let me run this city
the way I wanted to,

36:15.383 --> 36:17.635
it would not be in ruins now.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.762
I have the men, the money,

36:19.845 --> 36:22.598
-the guns...
- Gordon took them.

36:22.682 --> 36:24.558
Why? Because he still sees you

36:24.642 --> 36:27.186
as Fish Mooney's umbrella boy,
and he always will.

36:27.645 --> 36:28.688
Yes.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.273
I only came back
to help him save this city

36:31.357 --> 36:34.235
so that I could take it
for myself.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.237
We would be stronger together.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.615
No one could stop us.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.243
Yeah, perhaps.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.168
Let's make a pact,

36:51.252 --> 36:53.462
here and now.

36:53.546 --> 36:55.715
We will take what we want

36:55.798 --> 36:57.758
from who we want,

36:57.842 --> 37:00.720
and we will suffer
no fools.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.390
Together.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.226
Shall we shake
on that?

37:08.227 --> 37:09.687
Please,

37:09.770 --> 37:11.939
we're brothers.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.983
A hug.

37:15.151 --> 37:16.652
A hug it is.

37:16.736 --> 37:19.029
(panting)

37:32.585 --> 37:34.170
(sighs)

37:42.261 --> 37:44.305
Life begins anew.

37:48.017 --> 37:50.060
Shall we get to work?

37:57.777 --> 37:59.570
MAN: Thank you all for
coming here today.

37:59.653 --> 38:03.115
It is my great honor
to introduce Mayor Chang.

38:03.199 --> 38:04.909
(crowd murmuring)

38:04.992 --> 38:07.536
<i>CHANG:
With reunification underway</i>

38:07.620 --> 38:09.997
<i>and the bridges being rebuilt,</i>

38:10.080 --> 38:13.793
<i>it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon</i>

38:13.876 --> 38:16.378
<i>the title of commissioner.</i>

38:16.462 --> 38:18.380
(applause)

38:31.936 --> 38:34.563
(indistinct chatter)

38:34.647 --> 38:36.982
We're gonna miss you
around the bullpen.

38:37.066 --> 38:39.026
I won't be far.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.861
And the mission doesn't change.

38:41.403 --> 38:44.198
Still trying to make this city
a better place.

38:44.281 --> 38:45.616
Be careful.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.284
You're swimming with sharks now.

38:52.456 --> 38:54.667
If you need anything, ever...

38:54.750 --> 38:56.710
I know who to call.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.677
You deserve this, Jim.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.929
You really do.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.849
I'm gonna go get
a drink before...

39:09.932 --> 39:11.559
you get all teary-eyed on me.

39:11.642 --> 39:13.561
(sniffles)

39:20.025 --> 39:21.402
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

39:21.485 --> 39:23.237
Bane's in prison, it's over.

39:23.821 --> 39:28.325
My life here... it's too public.

39:29.243 --> 39:30.661
You've made up your mind.

39:30.744 --> 39:32.246
Gotham's in
good hands.

39:33.497 --> 39:34.540
Commissioner.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.292
Yeah.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.130
Thank you, Bruce,

39:41.213 --> 39:44.216
for everything you've done
for me and for the city.

39:45.634 --> 39:47.803
Gotham will always be your home.

40:00.858 --> 40:02.568
Bruce is all grown up.

40:03.527 --> 40:04.904
- That he is.
- Well,

40:04.987 --> 40:06.989
now you have another
little one to look after.

40:17.041 --> 40:18.834
Where's Bruce?

40:18.918 --> 40:21.003
Um...

40:21.795 --> 40:23.631
he left you this.

40:34.975 --> 40:36.894
(shuddering)

40:54.453 --> 40:57.790
BRUCE: You know how to reach
me if you need anything?

40:58.832 --> 41:00.376
Yes.

41:01.543 --> 41:05.464
Well, you know me, Master Bruce,
I'll be very self-sufficient.

41:07.257 --> 41:10.511
Busy, actually. You know,
we start the reconstruction

41:10.594 --> 41:13.806
of Wayne Enterprises
and Wayne Manor tomorrow.

41:15.724 --> 41:18.519
You will remember everything
I taught you, won't you?

41:20.145 --> 41:21.480
Of course.

41:25.401 --> 41:29.029
Good, that's... that's good.

41:30.239 --> 41:33.075
I never tried to replace
your parents, you know?

41:34.743 --> 41:36.745
I couldn't, I never would.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.874
But I want you to know,
Master Bruce,

41:40.958 --> 41:42.292
that you are the only son

41:42.376 --> 41:44.670
that I will
ever have,

41:44.753 --> 41:47.006
and I could not be more proud.

41:55.222 --> 41:56.598
(shuddering)

42:25.961 --> 42:27.880
(turbine whirring)

42:38.098 --> 42:40.017
(airplane taking off)

43:01.663 --> 43:03.582
<i>N' N'</i>
