WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.504
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.306
MARTY:
Gentlemen, we're almost there.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.208
-"Dan's Breakthrough."
-Time to make history.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.677
RICK: It's this hole.
It starts this day.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.346
Well, I'm dumbfounded. Those
bones and now this dating...

00:12.380 --> 00:14.448
That fits with Knights Templar.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.783
Here we go, guys,
another signal.

00:15.816 --> 00:18.219
Looks like a piece
of ammunition to me.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.454
-That's from a cannon.
-Rochefoucauld.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.090
ALEX: They are
a prominent French family.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.457
DOUG: This is a family
of Crusader kings.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.193
We now have a pathway

00:25.226 --> 00:26.760
from the Holy Land

00:26.794 --> 00:28.762
to Oak Island.

00:31.599 --> 00:35.136
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:35.169 --> 00:38.272
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.306 --> 00:41.409
for more than 200 years.

00:41.442 --> 00:44.578
So far,
they have found a stone slab

00:44.612 --> 00:47.415
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.617
17th century coins,

00:49.650 --> 00:52.753
even pieces of human bone.

00:52.786 --> 00:57.691
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.694
And, according to legend,

01:00.728 --> 01:03.431
one more will have to die

01:03.464 --> 01:06.634
before the treasure
can be found.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.246
*

01:21.849 --> 01:23.617
Ah, there's a sight I like.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.153
-Look at that.
-Yep.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.854
MARTY:
Couple of cranes ready to go.

01:26.887 --> 01:31.192
NARRATOR: It is the start of
a new day on Oak Island,

01:31.225 --> 01:33.727
as Rick and Marty Lagina--

01:33.761 --> 01:36.497
along with their friend
and partner Craig Tester--

01:36.530 --> 01:38.599
head to the Money Pit,

01:38.632 --> 01:40.468
where they are more convinced
than ever

01:40.501 --> 01:43.504
that they are on the brink
of a major discovery.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.540
MARTY: This is looking
generally familiar.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.343
-Let's go talk to Andrew.
-Good deal. Let's do it.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.612
NARRATOR:
They are also on the brink

01:51.645 --> 01:54.315
of one of the most
ambitious excavations

01:54.348 --> 01:56.684
ever undertaken on the island:

01:56.717 --> 01:59.720
the drilling of
a 50-inch-wide hole

01:59.753 --> 02:02.790
down to a depth
of some 200 feet

02:02.823 --> 02:08.496
into the area at the Money Pit
site known as Borehole H-8.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.464
-Andrew.
-Andrew.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.699
-Hey, Craig, Marty.
-MARTY: We're back.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.800
-Couldn't get rid

02:12.833 --> 02:14.502
of us that easy, could you?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.604
Absolutely not.
-Good to see you. -Yeah.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.373
Here we go.
Let's make hole!

02:19.407 --> 02:22.476
NARRATOR:
Last year the Oak Island team

02:22.510 --> 02:24.345
worked with
Irving Equipment Limited

02:24.378 --> 02:27.881
to excavate four steel-cased
40-inch-wide shafts

02:27.915 --> 02:30.651
in an effort to find
the original Money Pit

02:30.684 --> 02:34.322
that was first discovered
in 1795.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.657
But although the team made

02:36.690 --> 02:38.826
a number of promising
discoveries,

02:38.859 --> 02:41.629
including mysterious
metal objects,

02:41.662 --> 02:44.532
a hand-forged, rose-head spike

02:44.565 --> 02:48.469
and an 18th century
British military button,

02:48.502 --> 02:52.940
their efforts failed to locate
the infamous treasure vault.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.276
Okay, let's go see
"X" marks the spot.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.311
-Excellent.
-It's good.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.447
NARRATOR: In an effort to avoid
last year's mistakes,

02:59.480 --> 03:03.251
the team decided to try
and first locate the Money Pit

03:03.284 --> 03:05.986
by means of an exploratory
drilling program

03:06.019 --> 03:08.422
known as Geotech.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.424
And it was only
after drilling some

03:10.458 --> 03:13.594
44 six-inch-wide boreholes

03:13.627 --> 03:16.730
that they found the location
that became, for them,

03:16.764 --> 03:21.635
the most promising spot to dig:
Borehole H-8.

03:21.669 --> 03:26.674
Right here, we see this is
the... the top of hole of H-8.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.710
Uh, over here we see our
deviation for bottom of hole

03:29.743 --> 03:32.280
and over here is that
"X" marks the spot.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.014
Okay.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.716
ANDREW: So, this is where
we're going, right here.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.651
DAVE:
Right.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.289
So, where we actually hit
the bone is about here?

03:41.322 --> 03:42.856
-Yep.
-MARTY: Okay.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.860
-I think we're ready.
-Drill.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.862
NARRATOR:
Within the past few weeks,

03:48.896 --> 03:52.300
while carefully sifting through
the spoils from H-8,

03:52.333 --> 03:54.268
the Oak Island team has made

03:54.302 --> 03:56.537
a number of astonishing
discoveries,

03:56.570 --> 03:59.973
including fragments
of 18th century pottery

04:00.007 --> 04:03.844
located 190 feet deep
underground;

04:03.877 --> 04:06.480
small pieces of parchment;

04:06.514 --> 04:09.750
bits of leather, which appear
to be book binding;

04:09.783 --> 04:13.787
and, incredibly,
fragments of human bones--

04:13.821 --> 04:16.357
bones which, when tested,

04:16.390 --> 04:19.927
were determined to have come
from two different humans,

04:19.960 --> 04:23.831
one of European descent and
another from the Middle East.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.366
Wow!

04:25.399 --> 04:26.867
Middle East

04:26.900 --> 04:28.469
It about knocked me
off my chair.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.940
NARRATOR: In addition to all
of the physical evidence

04:32.973 --> 04:34.608
gathered from H-8...

04:34.642 --> 04:36.410
We're picking something else up
right here.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.012
...the team also discovered
the presence

04:39.046 --> 04:42.082
of what appeared to be
a large, metallic object

04:42.115 --> 04:46.354
at a depth of some 155 feet.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.990
It was at this same depth,
in 1897,

04:50.023 --> 04:53.627
that treasure hunters William
Chappell and Frederick Blair

04:53.661 --> 04:57.698
reported finding
a seven-foot-high wooden vault.

04:57.731 --> 05:01.835
A vault which, like H-8,
contained evidence of parchment

05:01.869 --> 05:05.038
and also bits of gold.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.576
An awful lot of very
significant things

05:08.609 --> 05:12.079
have come out of
just one hole, H-8.

05:12.112 --> 05:16.684
I am convinced we found
the original Money Pit.

05:16.717 --> 05:20.087
So, your casing is
that big, right?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.121
Ish?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.356
50-inch, yep.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.925
So, it should swallow it all up.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.661
-Good!
-All right. Let's go.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.933
NARRATOR: While similar
to the excavations

05:32.966 --> 05:34.968
conducted last year,

05:35.002 --> 05:37.971
this year the Irving team
will be bringing in

05:38.005 --> 05:40.374
a custom-made
rotating oscillator

05:40.408 --> 05:44.077
that will be bigger and more
powerful than ever before.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.548
They will be digging
wider and deeper

05:47.581 --> 05:49.817
in order to minimize any chance

05:49.850 --> 05:51.985
that the team could
miss their target.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.622
Should we drop something down
there for luck?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.557
Drop a coin down there
and see if you get it back.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.459
That's what I was going to--
exactly what I was going to do.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.660
-Here, I want to do that.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.596
MARTY:
Here's the test.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.697
Are we going to find this
or not, right?

06:03.731 --> 06:05.633
Go find your brother.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.704
-I did.
-It clicked.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.406
No. He said, "I will."

06:15.676 --> 06:19.079
RICK:
Okay. We're good to go.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.783
NARRATOR:
As Rick, Marty, and Craig wait

06:22.816 --> 06:24.918
for the final loads
of heavy digging equipment

06:24.952 --> 06:27.087
to arrive at the Money Pit,

06:27.120 --> 06:30.090
they have invited other members
of the Oak Island team

06:30.123 --> 06:33.594
to join them for an important
meeting in the war room,

06:33.627 --> 06:35.696
where they will be revealing
the results

06:35.729 --> 06:37.865
of the carbon testing
that was conducted

06:37.898 --> 06:41.835
on the two fragments
of bone from H-8.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.971
Well, gentlemen,
as you are aware,

06:44.004 --> 06:46.907
we fished two bones out of H-8
when we were drilling it.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.942
Mm-hmm.

06:48.976 --> 06:52.946
They were identified as human
bones, through DNA analysis.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.649
And then we asked Craig
to check into--

06:55.683 --> 06:58.552
using C-14--
how old they might be,

06:58.586 --> 06:59.987
and I understand
you have the results.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.022
That I do.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.825
Beta Analytical
got us the results,

07:04.858 --> 07:06.627
and I have the dates here.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.897
The first one
is the Middle East bone.

07:09.930 --> 07:16.136
The date is between
1682 and 1736.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.039
-Wow.
-RICK: That's a long time.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.908
That's a very long time.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.743
Yeah.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.245
So, the second one's
the European,

07:25.278 --> 07:31.685
and the date is 1678 to 1764.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.220
Well, I'm dumbfounded.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.756
-Those bones,
and now this dating... -Yeah.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.858
Don't make any sense to me.

07:37.891 --> 07:41.028
NARRATOR:
Two human bones?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.696
Each dating from between

07:42.730 --> 07:45.699
the late 17th
to mid

07:45.733 --> 07:49.937
And found some 160 feet deep
in the Money Pit?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.139
But how did they get there?

07:52.172 --> 07:55.576
And could the identities
of these two individuals

07:55.609 --> 07:59.212
hold some clue as to what
they were doing on Oak Island

07:59.246 --> 08:01.682
and, perhaps more importantly,

08:01.715 --> 08:04.518
what they might have
left behind?

08:04.552 --> 08:07.555
That's great, Craig,
that's fantastic news.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.557
-I don't know what
to make of it. -Yeah.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.926
I-I find it very odd
that-that there'd be

08:12.960 --> 08:16.196
two different humans
down in the, in the same pit.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.931
-Yeah.

08:17.965 --> 08:21.101
What are human bones doing
down at 162 feet?

08:21.134 --> 08:24.972
I-I-I find that
incomprehensible.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.274
Me, too.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.778
Maybe my belief level has
come up a bit with that data.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.747
His hasn't, 'cause he's
rock-solid anyway.

08:33.781 --> 08:37.117
-But people were down there...
-At those depths.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.220
At those depths,
around the 17th, 18th century.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.856
Predates searcher activity,
below searcher depth.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.192
Yes. What were they doing?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.326
Where is it?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.195
Where's the stuff?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.664
I find that very intriguing.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.165
Those dates.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.268
What theory do you like,
that these put it...?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.771
There's lots
of different theories.

08:57.805 --> 09:01.041
-Templars.
-It would.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.244
That certainly falls
into the time frame.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.047
European and Middle Eastern.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.750
And that fits
with Knights Templar, too.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.151
Yeah.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.053
I don't care
which theory you pick.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.989
It puts people
way deep in the Money Pit

09:16.023 --> 09:18.158
way prior to when
it was discovered.

09:18.191 --> 09:22.095
That has always been one
of my absolute requirements

09:22.129 --> 09:24.264
to get excited about this,

09:24.297 --> 09:27.234
is that definitive evidence

09:27.267 --> 09:31.338
of human workings
deep in the Money Pit

09:31.371 --> 09:34.041
prior to 1795.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.844
And those bones might be it.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.279
-Unfortunately,
it's another puzzle. -Yeah.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.381
-But a good piece.
-Yeah.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.085
-Well, we will slowly
unravel it. -Yeah, yeah.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.255
You're supposed to be solving
the mystery, not adding to it.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.757
-I know.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.291
We're trying.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.027
It will just make it more
interesting when we do.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.296
-MARTY: Oh, all right.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.831
Do you got anything else today,
Craig?

09:57.865 --> 09:59.266
-That's it.
-CHARLES: Okay.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.268
So, I think our work here
is concluded.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.171
We have to get to the bottom
of this and find the one thing.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.773
-Yeah.
-Okay.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.207
MARTY:
Let's get back out there.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.176
-CHARLES: Yeah.
-CRAIG: Sounds good.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.116
NARRATOR: As the team
from Irving Equipment Limited

10:16.149 --> 10:19.219
continues assembling
more than 400 tons

10:19.252 --> 10:22.790
of excavating equipment
at the H-8 dig site...

10:25.392 --> 10:28.395
...Rick, Marty and members
of the Oak Island team

10:28.428 --> 10:31.364
have arranged to meet
at the Mug and Anchor Pub

10:31.398 --> 10:34.201
in the nearby town
of Mahone Bay.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.803
-Hi, Doug.

10:35.836 --> 10:36.870
-Hey, Doug.
-Hey, Doug.

10:36.904 --> 10:37.871
-Gentlemen.
-Welcome.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.240
NARRATOR:
Although the team is convinced

10:40.273 --> 10:42.442
they have found the original
Money Pit,

10:42.475 --> 10:44.745
they still do not know
who may have dug it

10:44.778 --> 10:49.282
or what they might discover
at the bottom of H-8.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.852
Good to see you, Doug.
Where you been?

10:51.885 --> 10:54.054
-I've been well, I've been well.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.889
-Spending a lot of time
in the archives. -Okay.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.291
-Chasing leads.
-Okay.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.393
NARRATOR: Helping them
to find an answer is

11:00.427 --> 11:03.831
area historian Doug Crowell.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.801
Doug Crowell is a-- I mean his
fascination with Oak Island

11:07.835 --> 11:11.104
rivals our own, I think,
if not exceeds it.

11:11.138 --> 11:15.208
From a research agenda, I mean,
he's like a terrier with a bone.

11:15.242 --> 11:19.046
He's probably our go-to guy
in terms of doing research.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.814
Anyway, Doug,
what have you got for us?

11:20.848 --> 11:24.251
One of the things I was
following up on from last year

11:24.284 --> 11:28.021
was, remember the French Oak
Island map that Zena showed us

11:28.055 --> 11:29.857
last summer there?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.194
: Hello?
-Hi, Zena, it's Doug.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.430
NARRATOR: Last year,
New York-based researcher

11:37.464 --> 11:39.132
and historian, Zena Halpern,

11:39.166 --> 11:41.068
provided the team
with a hand-drawn,

11:41.101 --> 11:44.337
14th century map of Oak Island.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.108
It supported the theory that
members of the Knights Templar

11:48.141 --> 11:51.511
sailed to the New World
as early as the 12th century

11:51.544 --> 11:54.514
to hide priceless religious
treasures on the island,

11:54.547 --> 11:58.485
including the Holy Grail
and the Ark of the Covenant.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.044
Where did that map come from?

12:24.077 --> 12:28.215
That map was found in a book
between the pages,

12:28.248 --> 12:31.819
and it was more or less
discovered there.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.087
The quality of the map--
it's obviously hand-drawn,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.389
and it's not done
by a cartographer.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.292
Like hand-drawn maps
before the cartographers

12:39.326 --> 12:42.029
really got a hold of it and
fancied it up for publication.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.431
-Yeah.
-If you recall,

12:44.464 --> 12:46.133
up in the upper
right-hand corner,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.135
a loose translation of what was
written there was,

12:48.168 --> 12:52.973
"A small gift for
François de La Rochefoucauld."

12:53.006 --> 12:55.442
Well, I've been following up
on that name,

12:55.475 --> 12:58.045
and I think I found something
really interesting in the way

12:58.078 --> 12:59.279
that name connects
to Nova Scotia.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.383
So, Rochefoucauld.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.552
This is a really
interesting family

13:05.585 --> 13:07.254
because this is a family
of Crusader kings.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.459
So, these guys have a direct
connection to the Crusades,

13:12.492 --> 13:15.395
which I find really interesting.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.231
NARRATOR: A reference
to a noble French family

13:18.265 --> 13:24.171
linked to the Crusades
on a 14th century Templar map?

13:24.204 --> 13:26.439
Dating back
to the tenth century,

13:26.473 --> 13:29.376
the French noble family
La Rochefoucauld

13:29.409 --> 13:33.981
were a powerful house from
the ancient region of Neustria.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.951
Their lineage can also be
traced to the Lusignan family,

13:37.985 --> 13:41.154
who were among the ruling class
in the holy city of Jerusalem

13:41.188 --> 13:43.423
during the Crusades.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.926
Their bloodline also extended

13:45.959 --> 13:49.596
to George Washington,
Winston Churchill,

13:49.629 --> 13:52.933
and even Prince Charles
of England.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.335
Could this illustrious family,

13:55.368 --> 13:59.039
whose name appears on an
alleged 14th century map,

13:59.072 --> 14:02.475
be one and the same?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.277
RICK: I think we all have
questions about the map.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.313
You asked about where did
the map come from.

14:06.346 --> 14:10.517
I-I-I don't know that we ever
have created a proper timeline.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.419
No, I don't think we have.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.454
You know, and I think that's
what we need to do next.

14:14.487 --> 14:19.592
What I'm thinking is the college
that I work at, COGS,

14:19.626 --> 14:22.195
has a special collections room,

14:22.229 --> 14:24.998
which is a lot of old history
books on Nova Scotia and Acadia.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.466
And I'm thinking
that we might be able to find

14:26.499 --> 14:28.902
some pertinent information
there.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.538
And I guess I'm wondering
if anyone wants to come along

14:31.571 --> 14:33.173
and help me delve
into that information.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.508
I'd be glad for any
extra eyes I can get.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.910
Alex?

14:36.944 --> 14:39.046
-Sure.
-Excellent.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.515
We have a reference to the
Rochefoucaulds on Zena's map,

14:42.549 --> 14:44.584
and now Doug
has found a reference

14:44.617 --> 14:47.120
outside of Zena's research.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.990
When you get
corroborative evidence,

14:50.023 --> 14:51.992
it's always a "aha" moment,

14:52.025 --> 14:55.062
that this may be important
and we should follow this,

14:55.095 --> 14:57.197
and that's exactly
where Doug is headed.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.567
I think the information hunt
to me is every bit as important

15:00.600 --> 15:03.503
as what we're doing
on the island.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.604
Yeah.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.441
Well, so the hunt continues.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.677
-ALEX: Cheers.
-CRAIG: Cheers. -RICK: Cheers.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.113
MARTY:
To the hunt.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.618
NARRATOR:
The next day,

15:18.651 --> 15:22.555
Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Dave Blankenship

15:22.589 --> 15:25.392
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

15:25.425 --> 15:28.395
are searching for clues
on Lot 16,

15:28.428 --> 15:31.598
just north
of the Money Pit worksite.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.034
-There we go, guys.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.004
Ooh, another one.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.339
NARRATOR: It was here that
the team recently recovered

15:39.372 --> 15:42.209
two 17th century British coins,

15:42.242 --> 15:45.612
offering further evidence
of human activity on the island

15:45.645 --> 15:49.249
nearly a century before
the first documented discovery

15:49.282 --> 15:53.120
of the Money Pit in 1795.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.154
Look at David,
he's pretty excited.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.255
DAVE:
right, baby!

15:55.288 --> 15:56.356
It means something!

15:56.389 --> 15:58.625
That is fantastic.

15:58.658 --> 16:02.029
NARRATOR: They are looking
for any further evidence

16:02.062 --> 16:04.998
that may indicate
who may have visited Oak Island

16:05.032 --> 16:09.102
centuries ago, to deposit
something of great value.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.172
I find it interesting that
all the targets we're getting

16:12.205 --> 16:15.742
in this area
are underneath the trees.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.078
DAVE: Well, this was all farmed
at one time, Gary.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.524
Oh.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.793
Funny, you talking
about farming, Dave.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.762
You can see what this is.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.131
It's a horseshoe,
part of a horseshoe.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.034
MARTY:
Is it?

16:41.068 --> 16:43.336
Looks like a fairly small one.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.339
Gonna say it's a mule or a pony.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.211
That's what it looks like.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.812
GARY: So what's the deal
with all the wells around here?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.347
MARTY: I don't think
they're wells, Gary.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.782
DAVE:
I don't think they are, either.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.085
-I think they're search pits.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.552
-DAVE: Yep. -MARTY: Yep.
Somebody... -Old ones.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.221
NARRATOR:
Search pits?

17:01.254 --> 17:04.557
Located at shallow depths
on Oak Island?

17:04.591 --> 17:07.494
Ever since the Money Pit
was first discovered

17:07.527 --> 17:12.132
by Daniel McGinnis
and two friends in 1795,

17:12.165 --> 17:14.467
other searchers have snuck
onto the island

17:14.501 --> 17:18.105
to try their luck at locating
the fabled treasure.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.107
Numerous residents,

17:20.140 --> 17:23.543
from 18th century former
American slave Samuel Ball

17:23.576 --> 17:26.846
to 19th century landowner
Anthony Graves,

17:26.879 --> 17:30.450
have been connected to rumors
of valuable finds.

17:30.483 --> 17:34.587
Could their mysterious
good fortune give credence

17:34.621 --> 17:38.191
to the theory that Oak Island
holds not one vast treasure,

17:38.225 --> 17:39.759
but many,

17:39.792 --> 17:43.230
and in different,
secret locations?

17:43.263 --> 17:48.101
People have been digging on this
island for, well, 225 years.

17:48.135 --> 17:51.338
And the most intriguing story
is they hear digging at night.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.439
-DAVE: Yeah.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.511
They heard digging, and then
they went to investigate,

17:58.545 --> 18:01.648
and they found a hole,
and it appeared as though

18:01.681 --> 18:03.650
an object had been
pulled out of the hole.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.485
-And then they see
a drag trail... -Drag marks.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.720
...through the woods,
to the beach.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.423
They see the prow of a ship
coming onto the beach.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.559
They drag the chest,
or whatever it is, to there,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.127
they obviously lift it
in the boat,

18:14.161 --> 18:15.428
-and the boat takes off.
-DAVE: Off they go.

18:15.462 --> 18:18.231
-DAVE: Yeah.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.134
Well, yeah, well, let's see
if they missed something good.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.140
Here we go, guys.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.408
Another signal.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.742
-MARTY: All righty.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.745
That sounds good!
I like that one.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.383
It's deep as well, so I don't
know what the heck it is.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.185
It's reading 12 inches.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.287
So it could be even deeper.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.293
Where did it go?

18:46.326 --> 18:47.760
Once you get in here...

18:47.794 --> 18:49.429
It's not in that pile?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.698
GARY: Now, that's weird,
it's disappeared.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.234
Let me see if it's out on top.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.904
No, just deeper.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.906
That's a good sign.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.774
I just can't tell
what metal it is.

19:01.808 --> 19:06.279
All bets are off
when the targets are this deep.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.182
MARTY: Good. Boy, that is
rich-looking soil.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.717
GARY:
Let me have a re-check.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.486
This is a difficult...

19:15.522 --> 19:17.390
Ah, threshold's disappearing.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.559
That means it's iron,
and it's probably out.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.929
How can you tell that?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.764
Because the threshold
disappeared

19:24.797 --> 19:26.399
on the metal detector.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.934
-Meaning it's, uh...

19:27.967 --> 19:30.403
-Boy, I would never...
-...blanking it out as iron,

19:30.437 --> 19:31.938
it's rejecting it.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.645
Wow.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.981
That's from a cannon.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.316
Right?

19:51.991 --> 19:54.294
NARRATOR: While searching
the area on Oak Island

19:54.327 --> 19:56.363
known as Lot 16,

19:56.396 --> 19:59.932
Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Dave Blankenship

19:59.966 --> 20:02.769
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

20:02.802 --> 20:05.838
have just made
a potentially important find.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.741
I think this is a piece
of grapeshot, by the look of it.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.377
MARTY:
Really? Let's see it.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.512
GARY:
What would you use that for?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.247
I don't know.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.749
Looks like a piece
of ammunition to me.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.585
MARTY: This wouldn't have been
used by a farmer.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.420
That's from a cannon.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.590
Yeah. They would have packed it
and fired a lot of it.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.926
NARRATOR: Grapeshot is
a short-range artillery round

20:26.959 --> 20:30.263
that was used in both
land-based and naval warfare,

20:30.297 --> 20:33.866
dating back to as early
as the 15th century.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.670
Consisting of metal balls
linked by iron rings,

20:37.704 --> 20:40.773
the ammunition,
resembling a cluster of grapes,

20:40.807 --> 20:43.643
was tightly packed
in a cylindrical form

20:43.676 --> 20:45.712
and fired from cannons,

20:45.745 --> 20:49.549
creating a lethal blast pattern
to kill troops

20:49.582 --> 20:52.719
or to cripple warships
on the high seas.

20:52.752 --> 20:56.723
But if grapeshot is on the
island, how did it get there?

20:56.756 --> 20:59.292
-Is it evidence of a cannon...
-SOLDIER: Fire!

20:59.326 --> 21:00.660
...fired from Oak Island?

21:00.693 --> 21:04.397
Or of someone shooting at it?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.866
RICK:
The possibility that, you know,

21:06.899 --> 21:09.602
a cannon or cannonballs might
be in that area?

21:09.636 --> 21:11.638
You know, who knows
what we're gonna find?

21:11.671 --> 21:14.674
GARY: I'm gonna keep
going along this rock.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.977
I'll shout you back in if I get
any more interesting targets.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.386
That sounds sweet.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.488
This is a perfect scenario.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.857
-You've got rocks
trapping stuff. -Yep.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.960
Stopping it from sinking
further, whatever it is.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.497
Just here, mate.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.633
What the hell?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.509
The heck did it go?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.515
Typical Oak Island, isn't it?

21:55.548 --> 21:57.484
-MARTY: It's over there.
-GARY: It's over there.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.386
I mean,
you moved some big rocks.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.689
Hopefully, it was underneath
one of the big rocks.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.493
Come on, baby.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.833
It's getting smaller
and smaller.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.703
Ooh, it's a coin.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.137
-Yep. -GARY: Yeah.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.706
Check that out.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.642
How long has that
been there, eh?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.711
Is it an irregular shape?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.746
-MARTY: Yes.
-Fantastic.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.748
GARY: That means
it's more than likely old.

22:28.781 --> 22:32.151
NARRATOR: Could this mysterious
old coin be connected

22:32.184 --> 22:35.822
to the grapeshot that the team
just found earlier today?

22:35.855 --> 22:39.392
And after cleaning,
can it be dated

22:39.426 --> 22:41.694
to provide Rick, Marty
and the team a clue

22:41.728 --> 22:44.163
as to when it was left
on Oak Island,

22:44.196 --> 22:45.965
and who brought it here?

22:45.998 --> 22:48.000
MARTY: It looks a lot
like that maravedi

22:48.034 --> 22:49.569
we pulled out of the swamp,
but we'll see.

22:49.602 --> 22:50.737
We'll clean it up and we'll see.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.173
Couple of top pocket items,
right?

22:54.206 --> 22:55.642
Look, here's what's encouraging.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.909
This 132 acres?

22:56.943 --> 22:58.177
What did we do?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.812
-DAVE: Yeah.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.180
And look what we found.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.983
So, the possibilities
are incalculable.

23:04.016 --> 23:07.053
We got a lot of area to cover,
and we need to continue.

23:10.056 --> 23:14.026
NARRATOR: As the team continues
their exploration of Lot 16,

23:14.060 --> 23:16.496
Alex Lagina,
along with Peter Fornetti

23:16.529 --> 23:18.598
and Charles Barkhouse,

23:18.631 --> 23:21.901
travel approximately 80 miles
northeast of Oak Island

23:21.934 --> 23:24.637
to the Centre
of Geographic Sciences

23:24.671 --> 23:26.806
in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.908
-Good to see you.

23:28.941 --> 23:31.444
NARRATOR: They are joining
researcher Doug Crowell

23:31.478 --> 23:34.146
to find information
that may give them insight

23:34.180 --> 23:37.850
into the origins
of the Oak Island Money Pit.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.186
DOUG: What I thought
we'd do here today

23:40.219 --> 23:42.455
is take advantage
of the resources that are here,

23:42.489 --> 23:44.223
and see if we can find
any further connection

23:44.256 --> 23:47.627
to Nova Scotia
in the Rochefoucauld family.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.230
NARRATOR: After noticing
the name Rochefoucauld

23:51.263 --> 23:53.500
on a believed 14th century map

23:53.533 --> 23:56.235
connecting Oak Island
to the Knights Templar,

23:56.268 --> 23:58.471
the team is eager to see

23:58.505 --> 24:00.807
if evidence
of that noble French family

24:00.840 --> 24:04.511
can be traced to Oak Island
and the surrounding areas.

24:04.544 --> 24:08.581
Evidence that could validate
the map's authenticity.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.916
This is getting
really interesting,

24:09.949 --> 24:12.184
because this family
is one of the oldest

24:12.218 --> 24:14.253
and most noble families
in France.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.056
We want to find further ties.

24:17.089 --> 24:20.026
And really, it's just to roll up
our sleeves and dive in,

24:20.059 --> 24:21.761
-and see what we can find.
-Way ahead of you.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.830
-Awesome.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.665
-All right, so let's start
with these, yeah? -Okay, yes.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.771
ALEX:
This is what you've been doing?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.574
-This
is what I do a lot of, yeah.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.609
ALEX: We're looking for evidence
that the Rochefoucaulds

24:36.643 --> 24:38.044
are connected to Nova Scotia

24:38.077 --> 24:40.012
by more than just
a hand-drawn map.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.781
Basically, what we know

24:41.814 --> 24:44.717
is that they're
a prominent French family,

24:44.751 --> 24:47.053
and they would have had
the resources to do something

24:47.086 --> 24:49.288
like what we suspect might have
happened on Oak Island.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.090
So it's really just a process

24:51.123 --> 24:53.092
of going over and over
a ton of different stuff,

24:53.125 --> 24:55.027
and kind of building up
these connections.

24:55.061 --> 24:58.097
As Charles well knows,
you might flip a hundred pages

24:58.130 --> 25:00.166
-before you find that one gem
of information. -Exactly.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.576
DOUG:
Oh, guys, look at this.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.143
Here we go. This map.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.846
This was Samuel Champlain.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.181
-Yeah.
-He was an early cartographer

25:15.214 --> 25:16.883
that came over here.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.184
You and I have always been
intrigued by the fact

25:18.217 --> 25:20.086
that Champlain left
Mahone Bay off of...

25:20.119 --> 25:21.588
-Exactly.
-...off his map.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.823
NARRATOR:
Mahone Bay?

25:23.856 --> 25:26.158
Missing on a 17th century map

25:26.192 --> 25:30.863
drawn by the famed cartographer
Samuel Champlain?

25:30.897 --> 25:33.866
Known as
the "Father of New France,"

25:33.900 --> 25:38.170
Samuel Champlain was a key
figure in the exploration,

25:38.204 --> 25:42.809
and mapping, of Northeastern
Canada in the early 1600s.

25:42.842 --> 25:46.178
And yet, the map
that Champlain made

25:46.212 --> 25:48.915
of the area encompassing
Nova Scotia

25:48.948 --> 25:52.819
has a significant omission:
Mahone Bay,

25:52.852 --> 25:56.055
the region
where Oak Island is located.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.890
But why?

25:57.924 --> 26:00.159
Could it have been
a simple oversight?

26:00.192 --> 26:03.195
Or could there have been
a more strategic reason

26:03.229 --> 26:06.933
why all references
to Oak Island and its location

26:06.966 --> 26:10.202
were omitted from
this otherwise definitive map?

26:10.236 --> 26:12.672
It's a heck of an oversight,
isn't it?

26:12.705 --> 26:16.275
A 25-mile by 20-mile oversight,
with 360-plus islands in it.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.177
That's a big oversight.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.346
It's hard to believe
it wasn't purposely done.

26:20.379 --> 26:21.681
That's what I've always thought.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.315
How can you miss Mahone Bay?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.384
The man would have to be blind
not to see Mahone Bay.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.789
And he was too good of a
cartographer to not see the bay.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.402
NARRATOR: As final preparations
for the massive excavation

26:43.435 --> 26:47.139
of the H-8 shaft are being
completed at the Money Pit...

26:47.173 --> 26:48.307
Does this kind of
bring back memories?

26:48.340 --> 26:50.042
Sure does.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.111
...brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina,

26:52.144 --> 26:55.081
along with their friend
and partner Craig Tester,

26:55.114 --> 26:57.884
carefully inspect
the hammer grab equipment

26:57.917 --> 27:00.052
that will be used
to retrieve soil,

27:00.086 --> 27:01.854
and possible artifacts,

27:01.888 --> 27:05.191
from what will become
a 50-inch-wide hole.

27:05.224 --> 27:08.060
MARTY:
It must just be phenomenal,

27:08.094 --> 27:09.395
the force when this hits.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.100
That's why we have to be
very careful.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.902
There's significant trepidation
on my part--

27:15.935 --> 27:17.403
fear, if you will--

27:17.436 --> 27:21.107
that we damage something
that is irreplaceable.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.811
MARTY:
We've got pottery at 192 feet,

27:24.844 --> 27:26.879
leather book binding,

27:26.913 --> 27:29.248
we've got indications
of the Chappell Vault...

27:29.281 --> 27:30.917
RICK:
Bone.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.185
MARTY:
We've got bone.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.454
He doesn't want the last quote
on the wall up there

27:35.487 --> 27:37.023
to be-- in the museum-- to say,

27:37.056 --> 27:38.991
"Rick and Marty Lagina,
they solved the mystery

27:39.025 --> 27:41.160
-and destroyed the treasure."

27:43.162 --> 27:45.097
NARRATOR: The crew
from Irving Equipment Limited

27:45.131 --> 27:47.734
now moves a 35-ton "bridge"

27:47.767 --> 27:50.336
into position
over the dig site.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.405
The bridge will offer
a stabilizing platform

27:53.439 --> 27:56.809
for the 50,000-pound
rotating oscillator

27:56.843 --> 28:00.279
that will be used to drive
the massive steel caissons

28:00.312 --> 28:03.816
some 200 feet deep
into the earth.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.152
Because of its size,

28:06.185 --> 28:09.321
the oscillator had to be
custom-built in South Korea

28:09.355 --> 28:14.326
and then shipped to Oak Island,
exclusively for this operation.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.366
While the team awaits
the arrival of the oscillator

28:20.399 --> 28:22.134
at the Money Pit,

28:22.168 --> 28:26.238
80 miles away,
in the rare documents archive

28:26.272 --> 28:28.775
at the Centre
for Geographic Sciences,

28:28.808 --> 28:31.944
Alex Lagina and Peter Fornetti,

28:31.978 --> 28:35.347
along with historians Doug
Crowell and Charles Barkhouse,

28:35.381 --> 28:37.784
are continuing their hunt
for ties

28:37.817 --> 28:39.786
between
the Rochefoucauld family

28:39.819 --> 28:43.022
and the Oak Island mystery.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.325
Here's a book, guys.

28:48.294 --> 28:51.330
"Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons."

28:51.363 --> 28:54.300
So this was the gentleman
who Samuel Champlain...

28:54.333 --> 28:55.534
-That's right.
-...came over with.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.103
Champlain was his cartographer.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.237
Yeah.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.108
Oh, guys, look at this.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.412
Genealogy of the Dugua family.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.347
François de La Rochefoucauld.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.949
CHARLES:
Hmm.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.017
DOUG:
Married into the Dugua family.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.153
NARRATOR:
Pierre Dugua?

29:14.186 --> 29:17.990
The founder of the first French
colony in Nova Scotia?

29:18.024 --> 29:20.960
Related to a member
of the Rochefoucauld family?

29:20.993 --> 29:23.362
A family whose origins
date back

29:23.395 --> 29:26.032
to the days
of the Knights Templar?

29:26.065 --> 29:28.567
Could this be a descendent

29:28.600 --> 29:32.972
of the very same Rochefoucauld
that appears on Zena's Map?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.540
And could this explain

29:34.573 --> 29:37.977
why the famed cartographer
Samuel Champlain

29:38.010 --> 29:40.112
did not include Mahone Bay
when he created

29:40.146 --> 29:44.250
the first known maps
of the area around Oak Island?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.953
Is it possible
that he might have omitted it

29:46.986 --> 29:49.221
under the direction
of Pierre Dugua

29:49.255 --> 29:51.257
and the Rochefoucauld family,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.592
in an attempt
to protect something

29:53.625 --> 29:56.295
of great value hidden there?

29:56.328 --> 29:59.899
And does this connection mean
that Zena's map,

29:59.932 --> 30:03.035
found in an ancient book,
is authentic?

30:05.104 --> 30:07.874
So now we can see that this
isn't just a name on a map,

30:07.907 --> 30:09.842
it's actually connected
to the early history

30:09.876 --> 30:11.010
-of Nova Scotia.
-ALEX: Right.

30:11.043 --> 30:14.013
I will say
this is one of the, the more

30:14.046 --> 30:16.916
cohesively connected theories
that we've had.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.085
You know, there is a chain
that goes from Oak Island

30:19.118 --> 30:21.453
right to where it needs to go.

30:21.487 --> 30:25.424
We now have a pathway

30:25.457 --> 30:28.594
through this family,
from the Holy Land

30:28.627 --> 30:30.029
to Oak Island, if you will.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.439
NARRATOR:
In the war room,

30:40.472 --> 30:42.641
Rick Lagina and his nephew Alex

30:42.674 --> 30:45.878
are meeting to follow up
on critical new research

30:45.912 --> 30:48.580
into the origins
of the Oak Island mystery.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.150
You know, I've always been on
about the information hunt.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.919
You've heard it over and over
and over again.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.553
And, you know,
once Zena's map surfaced--

30:54.586 --> 30:56.956
when she was kind enough
to show us her research...

30:56.989 --> 30:58.124
-Mm-hmm.
-You know, this question

30:58.157 --> 31:00.927
of the Rochefoucauld family

31:00.960 --> 31:03.595
and, you know, possibly
a Templar connection there.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.498
My idea was
to hire a researcher.

31:06.532 --> 31:10.102
NARRATOR: After collecting
compelling new evidence

31:10.136 --> 31:13.105
that the Rochefoucauld family--
whose name appears

31:13.139 --> 31:15.474
on a 14th century map
of Oak Island--

31:15.507 --> 31:19.912
came to Nova Scotia as early
as the 1600s...

31:19.946 --> 31:23.249
the team has decided to pursue
further information

31:23.282 --> 31:26.318
in the Rochefoucaulds'
native France.

31:26.352 --> 31:29.021
So, I reached out to someone
embedded in France.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.622
Her name is Nichola Lewis.

31:30.656 --> 31:34.260
And what I've asked Nichola
to do is to reach out

31:34.293 --> 31:36.328
to the
"family Rochefoucauld castle."

31:36.362 --> 31:40.632
And the hope is that she can
help us gain access to that.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.201
I will call her up.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.469
That would be great.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.608
Hi, Nichola.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.377
Hi, there.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.212
NARRATOR:
Based in Saint-Marcel,

31:53.245 --> 31:56.348
Nichola Lewis is a researcher
and translator,

31:56.382 --> 31:59.285
with experience deciphering
French documents

31:59.318 --> 32:02.588
dating from the 16th
to the 18th century,

32:02.621 --> 32:05.958
specifically concerning French
activity in the New World

32:05.992 --> 32:10.096
and during the American
war for independence.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.199
RICK: The reason for hiring
Nichola is very simple.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.501
We can't do everything.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.170
Really, it was Doug
who gave us the idea

32:18.204 --> 32:19.638
to hire Nichola

32:19.671 --> 32:22.241
because he's not fluent
in French.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.176
He's followed that trail
as far as he can go.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.078
But I am of the opinion

32:26.112 --> 32:29.615
that it's always best
to have boots on the ground.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.351
Was wondering how
your research is going.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.221
Specifically, what about the
follow-up on the Rochefoucauld,

32:35.254 --> 32:37.356
because we have keen interest
in that,

32:37.389 --> 32:42.194
given the fact that
that name appears on Zena's map.

32:42.228 --> 32:46.065
Well, I have been in touch
with Sonia Matossian,

32:46.098 --> 32:48.034
who is a Rochefoucauld

32:48.067 --> 32:51.603
and she lives at the castle at,
uh, at La Rochefoucauld itself.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.073
And I asked her
if she would be willing

32:54.106 --> 32:56.308
to meet you
and to show you around.

32:56.342 --> 32:59.111
So, she's kind of
invited everybody.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.581
So, if you would like to
do that, it's definitely on.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.151
I would very much
appreciate that and, uh...

33:05.184 --> 33:07.186
-I'm in.
-Alex is already nodding.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.488
-So I know Alex is in.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.490
And I would love to be able to
include my other nephew, Peter.

33:11.523 --> 33:15.427
So, we kindly accept
that-that gracious offer.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.197
I'm hoping that Sonia Matossian

33:18.230 --> 33:20.332
will be able to help us a bit
on the map.

33:20.366 --> 33:24.470
And to see if she comes up
with anything interesting there.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.405
We very much look forward
to meeting you

33:26.438 --> 33:28.174
and getting an update
on your research.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.342
Well, me, too, and, um,

33:30.376 --> 33:31.810
I'm looking forward
to seeing you all.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.112
Thank you.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.580
Cheers.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.448
I'm looking forward to it.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.051
I think this is gonna be a
really, really cool opportunity

33:39.085 --> 33:43.122
to go to a... an ancient
family house in France.

33:43.155 --> 33:46.758
I truly think that the answer
to solving this mystery,

33:46.792 --> 33:50.062
um, lies in many places.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.663
And perhaps, you know,
we'll find

33:51.697 --> 33:53.665
some of those answers in Europe.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.802
There's a specific reference
to a specific family

33:56.835 --> 33:58.770
on the 1347 map.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.073
It's one of the best clues
on the map.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.075
We have to follow it up.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.177
I've always been on
about the information hunt.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.180
And this is an information hunt
to France.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.282
Great. Looking forward to it.

34:10.316 --> 34:13.319

34:13.352 --> 34:15.387
NARRATOR:
Later that day...

34:15.421 --> 34:18.090
MARTY: Today's the day, Rick.
Today's the day.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.858
NARRATOR:
Rick joins his brother Marty

34:19.891 --> 34:22.094
as they head to the Money Pit

34:22.128 --> 34:25.697
for the start of their massive
excavation of Borehole H-8,

34:25.731 --> 34:28.700
where they've already found
evidence of a vault,

34:28.734 --> 34:32.171
ancient pottery,
and even human bones

34:32.204 --> 34:36.575
more than 150 feet
below ground.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.810
Well, think of the effort
we went to.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.846
I mean, all those Geotech holes

34:40.879 --> 34:43.182
and painstakingly looking
at the samples

34:43.215 --> 34:45.317
and then looking
at the samples again

34:45.351 --> 34:47.719
and washing 'em and
finding these really odd things,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.688
-all of 'em in H-8.
-Oh, if there's one spot

34:49.721 --> 34:51.490
where there's something
in the Money Pit,

34:51.523 --> 34:54.193
-based on the pattern drilling,
it's there. -Right.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.262
*

34:56.295 --> 34:58.497
MARTY:
Many, many years ago,

34:58.530 --> 35:01.233
when we were sort of dreaming
about this island as boys,

35:01.267 --> 35:03.202
we had the idea
to be able to dig,

35:03.235 --> 35:05.237
dig up the fabled Money Pit,

35:05.271 --> 35:07.273
and now we're about to do it.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.740
RICK:
It's been a long time coming.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.442
This is the culmination

35:10.476 --> 35:12.211
of everything
we've done up till now,

35:12.244 --> 35:14.213
and we're ready to get after it.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.415
Here we be.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.487
Well?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.489
-Good morning! Today's the day.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.157
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Okay.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.458
-Morning, guys.
-OTHERS: Morning.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.361
The oscillator's on its way.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.230
It's coming around the turn,
here.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.365
-Here you go.
-CHARLES: There it is.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.367
-There we go.
-Yeah.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.573
Time to make history?

35:41.607 --> 35:43.842
Time to make history.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.677
JACK:
There we go.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.613
-ALEX: We're in the air.
-DAVE: We're floating.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.448
DANNY:
It's good right there, brother.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.754
NARRATOR:
Once in place over H-8,

35:55.787 --> 35:59.525
the oscillator will apply some
three million pounds of torque

35:59.558 --> 36:02.694
to drive the 50-inch-wide
caissons down

36:02.728 --> 36:06.232
as deep as 200 feet
in an effort to reveal

36:06.265 --> 36:07.799
what has been hidden
in the Money Pit

36:07.833 --> 36:10.369
for more than two centuries.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.506
MIKE:
Watch your toes!

36:16.875 --> 36:18.877
It looks like they're trying
to pick up

36:18.910 --> 36:20.812
that first piece of pipe.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.349
*

36:23.382 --> 36:25.617
Right now, they're gonna be
picking that starter can.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.719
-Two and 12, 26 feet long.
-MARTY: Yeah. Yeah.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.356
We'll place it
into the oscillator,

36:30.389 --> 36:31.990
-wedge it down,
-Yeah.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.793
get it in place, and then
we can start oscillating.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.562
We'll be slamming can, right?

36:36.595 --> 36:37.896
Slamming can.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.631
See those teeth?

36:39.665 --> 36:42.501
Those teeth are gonna get
to the bottom of this.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.840
*

36:48.874 --> 36:51.477
-There he is.
-MARTY: Hey, Daniel!

36:51.510 --> 36:54.580
NARRATOR: It is a historic
moment on Oak Island,

36:54.613 --> 36:57.383
as Rick, Marty,
and members of the team

36:57.416 --> 37:01.287
are joined by veteran treasure
hunter Dan Blankenship.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.622
Now age 94,

37:03.655 --> 37:06.392
Dan has spent more than half
his incredible life

37:06.425 --> 37:09.395
working to solve
the Oak Island mystery.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.430
And although he is unable

37:11.463 --> 37:14.466
to be as active in the field
as he once was,

37:14.500 --> 37:20.005
his determination to find
an answer is as strong as ever.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.474
MARTY: I should go write
on that, "Breakthrough."

37:22.508 --> 37:23.975
-You could.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.011
Yeah, all right. I'm going to.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.680
I suppose I should have
a hard hat on for that, eh?

37:28.714 --> 37:30.882
Give me that.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.285
-Hey, guys!
-MICHEL: Yeah.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.654
-DANNY: Of course.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.657
This is historical and this
is big, and we're all excited.

37:38.690 --> 37:42.394
It just seemed like a ceremony
was required of some sort,

37:42.428 --> 37:46.031
and I know there had been
writing on casings before.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.834
I remembered how many times
Rick has said,

37:48.867 --> 37:51.970
"We need to find
Dan's breakthrough,

37:52.003 --> 37:55.307
the breakthrough he's sought
for 50 years."

37:55.341 --> 37:58.310
So, I thought,
"All right, maybe this is it."

37:58.344 --> 38:01.313
"Dan's Breakthrough."
That's what I wrote.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.783
How's that?

38:04.816 --> 38:07.386
DAVE:
"Dan's Breakthrough."

38:08.954 --> 38:10.322
MARTY:
"Dan's Breakthrough."

38:10.356 --> 38:12.023
There it is.
-Yeah.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.526
It's on its way.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.429
Here he goes, guys.
Jack's got something, too.

38:17.463 --> 38:19.465
NARRATOR:
For the Oak Island team,

38:19.498 --> 38:23.869
breaking ground in H-8
has offered an emotional moment

38:23.902 --> 38:27.639
filled with both joy
and sadness...

38:27.673 --> 38:29.408
That's nice.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.643
...as they reflect
on another moment...

38:31.677 --> 38:33.545
Here you go, bro.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.647
...just one year ago,

38:35.681 --> 38:38.550
when the words "Forever Family"

38:38.584 --> 38:40.952
were first written
by Jack's brother,

38:40.986 --> 38:42.654
Drake Tester,

38:42.688 --> 38:45.357
who died earlier this year.

38:45.391 --> 38:48.827
Way to go, Drake.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.597
Watching the oscillator
about to break ground

38:51.630 --> 38:53.632
and watching Marty...
you know,

38:53.665 --> 38:55.701
write "Dan's Breakthrough"
on there,

38:55.734 --> 38:57.936
I had an overpowering feeling
that...

38:57.969 --> 39:00.105
you know, I needed to...

39:00.138 --> 39:03.442
I needed to go up there and...

39:03.475 --> 39:07.479
and write "Forever Family"
for my brother,

39:07.513 --> 39:10.682
'cause I just wish
he was here right now.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.950
Yeah.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.386
Yeah!

39:14.420 --> 39:15.921
That's right, Jack!

39:15.954 --> 39:17.689
MARTY:
That's right, Jack!

39:17.723 --> 39:21.059
It was very poignant and
very moving, very appropriate.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.761
-Absolutely.
-So, he wrote

39:22.794 --> 39:25.831
"Forever Family"
for his deceased brother

39:25.864 --> 39:28.800
and then he just initialed it,
Drake Tester.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.936
So that was beautiful.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.440
So, Dan, we're-we're about
to get everything going here.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.643
Would you do us proud and step
over there and press the button?

39:37.676 --> 39:39.645
Oh, sure. Yeah.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.847
-MARTY: It seems appropriate

39:41.880 --> 39:43.782
that Dan Blankenship,
who's given

39:43.815 --> 39:46.452
50 years of his life to this,
win, lose, or draw,

39:46.485 --> 39:48.019
has a chance to start

39:48.053 --> 39:50.422
this year's big dig
in the Money Pit.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.024
So, when he presses
the button, it's...

39:53.058 --> 39:55.494
here we go, you know?
This is gonna be your proof

39:55.527 --> 39:57.829
that what you started long ago,

39:57.863 --> 40:01.600
you will now see the completion
of it, hopefully, in this hole.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.635
We all believe that this is it.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.872
It's this hole.
It starts this day.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.675
Yeah. Let's hope you're right.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.510
-Yeah. -I believe we are.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.778
Now put the torque to it!

40:12.811 --> 40:15.213
Let's oscillate.
Right here, sir.

40:19.217 --> 40:22.087
All right. There she goes.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.889
-ALEX: All right.
-Making hole.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.791
-RICK: Yay!

40:25.824 --> 40:28.159
Good job, Dan.

40:28.193 --> 40:31.497
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty,
and their partners,

40:31.530 --> 40:36.635
the possibility of solving the
222-year-old Oak Island mystery

40:36.668 --> 40:39.838
has never been greater
than it is right now.

40:39.871 --> 40:43.241
And the answers they and
countless others before them

40:43.274 --> 40:45.644
have been so eager to learn

40:45.677 --> 40:47.979
have never been closer.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.682
But will they find
a priceless treasure

40:50.716 --> 40:54.119
buried on the island
by 17th century pirates?

40:54.152 --> 40:59.190
Or will they find a vast vault
filled with precious artifacts,

40:59.224 --> 41:01.560
hidden away and guarded
for centuries

41:01.593 --> 41:04.563
by the Knights Templar?

41:04.596 --> 41:06.898
This much is certain:

41:06.932 --> 41:09.167
hundreds of lives
have been invested

41:09.200 --> 41:11.670
on a centuries-old quest.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.906
Six have paid
the ultimate price.

41:14.940 --> 41:19.778
And the remains of two souls
lie deep underground.

41:19.811 --> 41:24.783
Could the human cost equal
the value of what lies below?

41:24.816 --> 41:30.088
Or will the island demand
an even steeper price

41:30.121 --> 41:35.060
before it reveals its secrets?

41:35.093 --> 41:37.863
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.896 --> 41:40.298
This takes the information hunt
to another level.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.133
On his shield,
he's got this cross,

41:42.167 --> 41:44.836
-which is exactly like
the H.O. Stone. -MARTY: Wow!

41:47.806 --> 41:49.107
RICK: There was a reference
to your family name.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.275
Are there Templar connections?

41:50.308 --> 41:52.644
There obviously is a connection.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.746
RICK: They're trying to relay
some sort of information.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.314
The secret's behind that wall.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.149
This is a Templar cross.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.585
JERRY GLOVER:
These don't exist anywhere else.

41:59.618 --> 42:00.852
They only exist here.

42:00.886 --> 42:02.988
It's what we came for, really.
