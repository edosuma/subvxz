00:06.140 --> 00:10.080
THE FINNMARKSVIDDA PLATEAU
YEAR 1031

00:57.050 --> 01:02.110
-Who are you, stranger?
-Alfhildr Enginnsdottir.

01:02.150 --> 01:07.060
I seek Tore from Bjarkøy,
the slayer of Olaf the Stout.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.120
What do you want with him?

01:13.210 --> 01:17.120
To kiss him where the sun doesn't shine.

01:33.190 --> 01:38.070
Greetings, fatherless woman.
I hear you're looking for a man?

01:38.110 --> 01:42.220
Yes, the one they call Tore Hund.

01:44.070 --> 01:48.080
-Have you seen him?
-Seen him I have not.

01:48.120 --> 01:52.120
My outward vision
faded away with the summer.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.030
But he was here.

01:56.140 --> 01:58.160
What did he want?

01:58.200 --> 02:03.060
He asked about
the lake with a thousand lights.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.060
Where is it?

02:06.180 --> 02:10.120
Sometimes here...
Sometimes there...

02:10.160 --> 02:13.120
But where was he headed?

02:15.240 --> 02:18.220
Please, that man is everything to me.

02:21.200 --> 02:27.040
Yes, he is quite
the ladies' man, this Tore.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.220
You're not the first person
to ask for him.

02:34.030 --> 02:38.160
Like I said
to the girl with the flame hair,

02:38.200 --> 02:43.030
only Ravgga knows where Tore is now.

02:45.230 --> 02:48.100
Then let me speak to Ravgga.

03:36.120 --> 03:42.140
I see a place
where the cities shine like stars...

03:43.170 --> 03:50.030
Where the houses
are as tall as mountains,

03:50.070 --> 03:54.050
and words can travel with the wind.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.150
The police have no new leads

04:18.190 --> 04:22.180
in the case with the beforeigner woman
at Tjuvholmen.

04:22.220 --> 04:26.100
She was murdered after arriving
in a flash in the Oslofjord.

04:26.140 --> 04:30.180
This is the first incident of violence
against a newly-arrived in Norway.

04:30.220 --> 04:32.170
The Minister of Justice...

04:41.050 --> 04:45.020
-Voice command activated.
-Google "trawl".

04:45.060 --> 04:48.170
-Here's what I found about "troll".
-No...

04:49.230 --> 04:52.010
Google "pelagic trawl".

04:53.090 --> 04:57.200
I'm sorry. I couldn't find
"paraplegic brawl" in the music library.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.170
No...

05:07.070 --> 05:09.200
Did you climb down? You're mad!

05:23.110 --> 05:25.070
Hey! Hey!

05:26.200 --> 05:29.240
-Please back away.
-I'm with the police.

05:44.160 --> 05:50.100
-Mighty mongrel! I'm afraid of heights!
-Who were they?

05:50.140 --> 05:55.100
Bohemians who claim to have
sole right to drop selling.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.080
I see.

05:59.120 --> 06:03.080
If they come back, call me.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.140
Okay, if they come back, just run.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.130
Good advice.

07:25.180 --> 07:30.090
Several speeches at today's
memorial for the beforeigner woman

07:30.130 --> 07:35.160
who was found dead at Tjuvholmen,
were critical of the Oslo police.

07:35.200 --> 07:41.040
Haaland! Can you make some talking
points for my session on the news radio?

07:41.080 --> 07:42.200
Not now, I'm afraid.

07:49.190 --> 07:53.190
Hey. You may have been onto something.

07:53.230 --> 07:58.060
-I won't fall for it again.
-Not the monster. The Norse girl.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.120
-She saw something in the water.
-Okay?

08:01.160 --> 08:03.040
Come on.

08:09.020 --> 08:10.140
Look at this.

08:16.070 --> 08:21.070
We believe the marks found on the woman
can come from one of these.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.040
I think we're looking for someone

08:25.080 --> 08:28.050
catching
beforeigner women with a trawl bag.

09:37.030 --> 09:39.050
Fuck you, Navn!

09:39.090 --> 09:41.170
It's the same fun every time.

09:44.190 --> 09:48.060
Aren't you going to leave
those poor bunnies alone?

09:48.100 --> 09:52.200
I need my protein.
Do you think this body comes for free?

09:52.240 --> 09:56.150
Fine, cave boy. Save some for tonight.

10:04.140 --> 10:08.020
Coastal Administration
sent us last year's sales

10:08.060 --> 10:11.120
of professional fishing equipment
in the region.

10:11.160 --> 10:15.100
Print all sales of trawls
and similar products.

10:15.140 --> 10:20.000
We're looking for buyers
who aren't in the industry.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.210
But this is several hundred pages!

10:23.000 --> 10:26.150
Yes, that's why you have to sort it.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.150
Is this a practical joke?

10:29.190 --> 10:32.160
No, Alfhildr.
This is police work.

11:20.150 --> 11:21.230
TRAWL BAG

11:38.140 --> 11:41.130
-Is this a bad time?
-No, come in.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.120
Have you seen the news?

12:07.220 --> 12:10.190
The woman is everywhere.

12:10.230 --> 12:14.010
But you thought you could go on
like nothing happened?

12:14.050 --> 12:17.000
No, that was our mistake.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.130
We're taking the necessary measures.

12:20.170 --> 12:24.070
I scrubbed the boat myself
and burned fishing stuff.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.130
It's un-enough.

12:26.170 --> 12:30.060
The girls must be hidden
until this blows away.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.140
Okay?
And where are we going to hide them?

12:33.180 --> 12:35.200
We have some barracks on Hovedøya.

12:35.240 --> 12:41.050
-That's in the red zone.
-Exactly. So it's a good hiding place.

12:41.090 --> 12:44.200
This won't work.
HC's going to snap.

12:44.240 --> 12:50.140
Ask yourselves: What's worse?
If HC snaps, or if Navn snaps?

13:14.030 --> 13:17.220
So beforeigner cases
are a priority with the police?

13:18.010 --> 13:22.220
Yes. And in the Tjuvholmen case,
one of the main investigators

13:23.010 --> 13:27.190
is actually a true Viking.
The criticism is completely unjustified.

13:27.230 --> 13:32.090
We have a policy on this show
that we avoid using the V-word.

13:32.130 --> 13:37.100
-The V-word?
-We prefer "of Norse descent".

13:37.140 --> 13:41.060
Right. Of course. My apologies.

13:50.060 --> 13:53.050
Alex?

13:53.090 --> 13:56.160
I found some footage
on a web site with arrival videos.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.230
It was recorded near Hovedøya
on the night of the murder.

14:00.020 --> 14:04.040
The clip wasn't relevant, but
could you check for more raw footage?

14:04.080 --> 14:08.070
Yeah, send me a link,
and I'll take a look.

14:08.110 --> 14:11.020
Lars? Someone's here to see you.

14:18.110 --> 14:21.120
-Well.
-What are you doing here?

14:21.160 --> 14:26.100
-You're not answering your phone.
-I've been busy.

14:26.140 --> 14:30.040
-This isn't a good time, either.
-Not a good time?

14:30.080 --> 14:33.180
Did you think it was
a good time for us to be tricked?

14:33.220 --> 14:35.210
-Tricked?
-Yes.

14:37.190 --> 14:40.230
-What's this about?
-Don't play dumb, Lars.

14:41.020 --> 14:45.130
You know we told Ingrid no
on getting in on that russebus .

14:45.170 --> 14:49.210
The bank confirmed that the money
came from your account.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.170
Maybe. Divorced parents often disagree
about their kids' russ-celebration.

14:55.210 --> 15:02.000
Lending Ingrid 10 000 kroner behind
our backs isn't anywhere near normal.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.200
-I don't like your tone.
-You don't like my tone?

15:05.240 --> 15:09.060
Where did you get that money anyway?

15:09.100 --> 15:12.120
I thought you were too broke
to pay child support?

15:12.160 --> 15:17.060
Darling? This isn't how we agreed
to address this problem.

15:17.100 --> 15:21.030
I'm sorry, but it's my daughter
we're talking about.

15:21.070 --> 15:26.030
Right. It doesn't feel too good
to be kept in the dark, does it?

15:26.070 --> 15:30.110
Is that what this is about?
Is this some kind of payback?

15:30.150 --> 15:34.220
I've never undermined you
like this! Never!

15:35.010 --> 15:38.000
Listen. If you'll allow me, Marie...

15:38.040 --> 15:41.220
I recently attended a seminar
with a family psychologist

15:42.010 --> 15:45.170
who is an expert
in diverse constellations.

15:45.210 --> 15:52.180
Maybe I should ask if she can meet us to
help sort through this mire of passions?

15:52.220 --> 15:56.240
-Actually, that's a great idea.
-I don't think so.

15:57.030 --> 16:02.070
This was a severe breach of trust, Lars.
That trust needs to be restored.

16:02.110 --> 16:05.150
We'll notify you of the time and place.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.040
Alfhildr?

16:19.080 --> 16:21.240
I got a call from
the National Gallery.

16:22.030 --> 16:26.040
They have a person in custody
who wants to speak with you.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.120
-With me?
-I didn't catch the name.

16:28.160 --> 16:34.020
They left a strange message. You used
to take walks with a dog named Tore?

16:57.170 --> 17:00.140
Enginnsdottir, I'm with the police.

17:11.060 --> 17:14.050
You look good.

17:17.060 --> 17:21.120
-When did you get to this time?
-This is my second summer.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.150
Why didn't you contact me sooner?

17:25.220 --> 17:29.130
I saw you on the B4 frændi group.

17:29.170 --> 17:34.020
But things didn't end well between us
back in the old days.

17:34.060 --> 17:39.130
That happens when you
go after someone else's man.

17:45.150 --> 17:49.010
Can we forget about that nonsense?

17:49.050 --> 17:52.070
Nice to see you, shieldmaid.

17:52.110 --> 17:53.210
What is it?

17:54.000 --> 17:59.040
I'm with the police now. Warriors
don't get authorization for that.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.220
What did you put
as your "original profession"?

18:02.010 --> 18:07.170
-Farmer's wife.
-Farmer's wife? You?

18:07.210 --> 18:11.100
You couldn't milk a cow
for a fathom of gold!

18:11.140 --> 18:14.140
Let's drop that.
Why were you arrested?

18:15.210 --> 18:21.110
I ripped a false drawing of Tore.
Apparently it's worth thousands.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.130
In that case,
I don't know if I can help you.

18:31.110 --> 18:37.240
Do I have to bring up that time when
I saved your skinny ass in Bjarmaland?

18:47.130 --> 18:50.080
This is completely ruined.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.160
Hello. I hear you're considering
reporting this incident?

18:58.200 --> 19:03.100
Of course! This is one of the most
severe cases of vandalism we've had!

19:03.140 --> 19:06.220
Did you know that the woman
fought at Stiklestad?

19:07.010 --> 19:10.190
She's considering a counter-suit
for triggering PTSD.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.140
It's not a problem,

19:14.180 --> 19:19.010
you just have to document
that everything's in order here.

19:19.050 --> 19:22.020
What do you mean
when you say "in order"?

19:22.060 --> 19:25.220
That you have warning signs
in Norse and Mesolithic

19:26.010 --> 19:30.200
by the entrances to sections
with trauma-triggering artwork.

19:41.220 --> 19:46.230
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.160
Now it's time to celebrate.

19:49.200 --> 19:54.040
-I'm in the middle of something at work.
-Come on!

19:54.080 --> 19:57.050
Don't leave your old sister hanging!

19:57.090 --> 20:01.120
Give us two fax stews
and a king-size horn of mead.

20:03.180 --> 20:05.050
Hello!

20:19.070 --> 20:23.240
HERE'S ALL THE FOOTAGE
I FOUND ON THAT DATE. ALEX.

21:00.090 --> 21:03.070
We bring thanks
for your guardian angeling.

21:03.110 --> 21:05.200
That's really not necessary.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.220
We won't take no thanks as an answer.

21:09.240 --> 21:13.120
I guess you should come inside.

21:25.100 --> 21:28.210
I'm not sure it's good for him
to watch this.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.220
Who doesn't like
stabbing and naked girls?

21:35.010 --> 21:36.150
Yes, but he's...

21:41.200 --> 21:45.240
-Where's his mother?
-We lost her in the salt.

21:47.110 --> 21:49.000
On our way over.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.050
I'm trying to be his rock.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.190
Hey.

22:01.010 --> 22:06.220
All things considered,
you're doing a great job, my friend.

22:10.050 --> 22:11.170
Thank you.

22:12.010 --> 22:19.000
This is the first time someone in this
time has friend-called me and meant it.

22:23.150 --> 22:27.060
And you?
Where is your baby mother?

22:27.100 --> 22:30.090
Oh, right. No, she's...

22:30.130 --> 22:34.160
She left with a pipe-smoking guy
from the 1800s.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.070
Damn!

22:38.230 --> 22:43.220
-What's that?
-Dad... Pjokk...

22:45.020 --> 22:48.080
-Your family?
-Yes. And you?

22:48.120 --> 22:52.180
Oh, no! That's...

22:52.220 --> 22:56.220
-I have mouse arm syndrome.
-Yes, mouse arm!

22:57.010 --> 22:59.130
-And your fingers too..?
-Yeah.

23:03.190 --> 23:08.120
Can you believe there's one of these
on every corner nowadays.

23:08.160 --> 23:13.090
Do you know who
this house of God was named after?

23:13.130 --> 23:17.070
-No.
-Olaf the Stout.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.050
There he is! White Christ!

23:31.020 --> 23:35.220
How did this pathetic god get
the whole world to kneel at his feet?

23:36.010 --> 23:40.120
Unbelievable. Do you think
that's why we're here, in this time?

23:40.160 --> 23:46.210
To teach people that they need gods who
won't be nailed down without a fight?

23:57.150 --> 24:02.140
Can we go soon?
I think he's using his magic on me.

24:02.180 --> 24:08.240
Relax. I just put some shrooms in our
fax stew while you were in the bathroom.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.130
Fuck you!
I have to be at work in the morning!

24:13.220 --> 24:17.220
Watch your language,
or you will upset White Christ.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.230
Have some Jesus wine.
It will round off the shrooms.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.000
Just imagine...

24:27.100 --> 24:32.130
All these poor sods were born
thousands of summers after us.

24:32.170 --> 24:35.230
-And yet here they are.
-Too bad for them.

24:37.170 --> 24:40.220
Do you see, White Christ?

24:41.010 --> 24:43.220
Your little lambs
are dropping like flies,

24:44.010 --> 24:48.050
while Odin's shieldmaidens
are still standing!

24:48.090 --> 24:54.140
Come down from your cross
and fight like a man!

24:57.100 --> 25:03.240
I know one thing:
You're crazier than ever.

25:04.030 --> 25:09.160
Let's go to Nivlhel.
The DJ there is awesome!

25:18.110 --> 25:20.020
Shut up!

25:20.060 --> 25:22.050
Hey!

25:22.090 --> 25:24.030
Norway for nowaday people!

25:24.070 --> 25:27.000
-What?
-You don't belong here!

25:27.040 --> 25:30.080
We were here before you.
Want to fight?

25:35.230 --> 25:37.150
Didn't think so.

25:40.120 --> 25:45.170
Come on. We have to see
where that van's going.

25:45.210 --> 25:49.080
The van? What are you talking about?
We're going dancing!

26:20.060 --> 26:22.100
What are you doing here?
Hauk's got the door tonight.

26:22.140 --> 26:26.180
Navn told us to get the girls
away from the club, tonight.

26:29.100 --> 26:33.150
-Which ladies are you talking about?
-All the ones we've supplied.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.060
That's more or less the whole caboodle!

26:37.100 --> 26:41.210
How am I going to run this establishment
without any women?

26:42.000 --> 26:45.030
Are you and homo habilis
going to decorate the aquarium?

26:45.070 --> 26:48.070
-We'll get some regular women.
-It's not the same.

26:48.110 --> 26:52.130
Why are you so worried?
All the paperwork's taken care of.

26:52.170 --> 26:55.070
-But Navn thinks...
-Navn, Navn, Navn!

26:55.110 --> 26:57.190
That cave gnome's not my boss.

26:57.230 --> 27:02.070
The people I report to
aren't going to be happy about this!

27:03.180 --> 27:06.080
We're taking the girls. Now.

27:17.090 --> 27:18.210
Come on!

27:24.150 --> 27:27.120
I'm not going in there!

27:27.160 --> 27:31.110
-That place is for filthy old men.
-Calm down.

27:32.110 --> 27:36.040
I just need something
for a case I'm working on.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.200
What's happening to you?
You're full of shrooms and mead,

27:39.240 --> 27:43.140
yet you talk about work?
We were going dancing!

27:46.190 --> 27:52.040
There, my dear shieldmaid.
Let's dance.

27:57.040 --> 28:01.200
What does a land-based security company
need a trawl bag for?

28:01.240 --> 28:06.080
When I spotted their logo on a van,
I decided to follow it.

28:06.120 --> 28:10.000
I suspect they're taking
newly arrived women from the sea

28:10.040 --> 28:15.140
to use them as prostitutes, and
that the murder is connected to this.

28:15.180 --> 28:18.190
-This is very interesting.
-Yes.

28:18.230 --> 28:22.200
But I don't understand.
Were you out scouting after hours?

28:22.240 --> 28:27.120
No, the discovery was coincidental.

28:27.160 --> 28:30.120
I was actually out
for a social gathering.

28:30.160 --> 28:34.230
-Looks like you socialized pretty good.
-Oh, sorry.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.200
That's from the social gathering.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.060
-Oh...
-There.

28:41.100 --> 28:45.110
You'd better take over, Lars.
What do we know about the company?

28:45.150 --> 28:49.220
What we know so far
is that CM a security company

28:50.010 --> 28:53.180
where most of the employees
are of prehistoric background.

28:53.220 --> 28:56.070
But the van Alfhildr took a picture of

28:56.110 --> 29:00.220
is registered to the general manager,
Gedi Suleman.

29:01.010 --> 29:04.100
He's one of a few present-day people
who work there.

29:04.140 --> 29:10.220
-So what now? A razzia against the club?
-No. We should keep a low profile.

29:36.050 --> 29:37.220
Thanks.

29:43.140 --> 29:45.130
Maybe you could open your window?

29:47.000 --> 29:52.130
Come on! It reeks like an old mead house
in here. Open the window!

30:11.030 --> 30:13.200
Just three months ago, Astrid from H&M

30:13.240 --> 30:18.100
suggested a collaboration
with my brand, Caveman's Wife.

30:20.150 --> 30:26.110
And now here I am, holding the hottest
collection of pillow cases this season.

30:30.070 --> 30:34.200
And if that wasn't enough, I'm making
an announcement on my blog tonight.

30:34.240 --> 30:39.090
Most of you know that Kolbein
was among the first beforeigners

30:39.130 --> 30:42.070
to come out as bi-gender.

30:42.110 --> 30:48.170
So, we've decided that all proceeds of
the pillow sales will go to the LGBTB.

30:59.010 --> 31:04.050
Enchanté, my patinated friend.
To what do we owe the festivities?

31:04.090 --> 31:07.140
Wife has won glory for blogging.

31:07.180 --> 31:13.100
I admire Caveman's Wife's musings
on multi-temporal cohabitation.

31:14.220 --> 31:19.010
-Aren't you going to invite me in?
-No. What do you want?

31:19.050 --> 31:22.200
I'll tell you what I want.
I want my girls back.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.030
Not in front of the guests.

31:35.230 --> 31:42.150
When I first came here,
10 000 years ago, all of this was ice.

31:43.090 --> 31:47.010
My herd said
the place was unsuited,

31:47.050 --> 31:50.150
but I braced myself
and behindstayed.

31:50.190 --> 31:56.090
I sealhunted and dug ice caves
throughout the winter.

31:56.130 --> 32:00.120
By third full moon
the herd came back.

32:01.170 --> 32:06.140
And look at this place now.
It's packed with people!

32:06.180 --> 32:11.090
All because someone bothered
to dig the first ice cave.

32:13.180 --> 32:17.080
I don't get the point
of all this reminiscing.

32:17.120 --> 32:23.040
When I bid that the mermaid girls
should lay low, that's how it is.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.060
So everyone has to obey you

32:25.100 --> 32:29.040
because you ate the first
seal steak in Christiania?

32:29.080 --> 32:32.120
-Who do you think you are?
-I don't think anything.

32:33.160 --> 32:38.160
Get the girls back.
Or the Bohemians will take action.

32:45.070 --> 32:50.100
No one threatens Navn
during his wife's blog party.

32:52.040 --> 32:56.030
Should I break your skull?
Is that what you want?

32:56.070 --> 32:57.240
Navn?

33:33.150 --> 33:37.030
-What's he doing?
-He's buying temproxate.

33:37.070 --> 33:40.020
-Should we arrest him?
-No, not yet.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.000
Hey, where are you going?

34:34.030 --> 34:36.230
Put some effort into it!

34:37.020 --> 34:39.060
You row like an old woman.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.090
Police!

36:19.240 --> 36:22.150
Don't move!

36:52.060 --> 36:53.180
Come on.

36:55.070 --> 36:59.210
Where were you standing
when you threw that rock? Over there?

37:00.000 --> 37:04.160
-Something like that.
-Impressive. That must be 30 meters.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.200
Where did you learn that?

37:06.240 --> 37:11.100
Kids used to throw rocks
at each other where I come from.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.220
That's an exciting childhood.

37:15.010 --> 37:19.160
Maybe I came off as cocky the first
time we met, but I meant what I said.

37:19.200 --> 37:23.130
I'd like to go out
for a cup of mead sometime.

37:25.100 --> 37:27.010
Okay.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.140
Yeah...

37:31.180 --> 37:33.190
Steady...

37:42.120 --> 37:46.040
Do you know
a man with a tattoo like that?

37:49.040 --> 37:52.230
A man and a little boy.
He has a tattoo similar to yours.

37:54.240 --> 38:00.160
Take a picture of the girls and send it
to the missing persons department.

38:13.070 --> 38:15.040
I'm just going to...

38:22.170 --> 38:24.190
How's your head?

38:24.230 --> 38:29.110
It doesn't look too good.
You should get the wound cleaned.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.230
Let's see...

38:37.180 --> 38:41.120
-Never seen her before.
-You've never seen her?

38:43.040 --> 38:46.050
-No.
-Okay.

38:48.210 --> 38:53.180
Your company,
Cro Magnon Security...

38:53.220 --> 38:58.080
It's owned by a shell corporation
in the Cayman Islands.

38:58.120 --> 39:02.220
-Do you know who's behind the company?
-I have no idea.

39:04.160 --> 39:08.110
You don't know who owns
the company you manage?

39:08.150 --> 39:10.070
I'm afraid not.

39:16.190 --> 39:19.040
I can't get them to talk.

39:19.080 --> 39:24.110
Tech didn't find any connection
to the Tjuvholmen woman on the boat.

39:26.120 --> 39:30.230
You'll have to excuse me.
I must talk to my acquaintance.

39:37.070 --> 39:41.080
They told me to come with
to station house.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.170
-Are we in drop trouble?
-No, not at all!

39:46.210 --> 39:49.170
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

39:49.210 --> 39:51.120
Come.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.130
That's not a tear I see, is it, Haaland?

40:33.180 --> 40:37.010
This is the 21st century.

40:37.050 --> 40:40.080
Men are allowed to show their emotions.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.070
Of course.

40:56.200 --> 41:00.130
"Battlements broken."

41:02.130 --> 41:05.050
"Giant's work shattered."

41:06.110 --> 41:09.180
"Chipped roofs are torn and fallen."

41:11.020 --> 41:15.130
"Torn up, destroyed,"

41:15.170 --> 41:18.170
"and undermined by old age."

41:40.010 --> 41:43.000
The gang's going out to celebrate.
Are you coming?

41:43.040 --> 41:46.210
-I have to finish this.
-What are you watching?

41:47.000 --> 41:50.180
Footage from the Coast Guard's
surveillance camera.

41:56.040 --> 42:00.140
There's a few hours. You go.
I'll text you if I find anything.

42:00.180 --> 42:04.170
Forget it. I'm a huge film bluff!

42:10.180 --> 42:13.170
No thanks.
I'm allergic to gluten.

42:15.110 --> 42:16.240
What the hell is gluten?

42:18.200 --> 42:21.170
-Something in the bread.
-What thing?

42:24.080 --> 42:28.160
It's a substance...
Or maybe not a substance.

42:28.200 --> 42:32.000
You call me superstitious,
but you can't eat bread

42:32.040 --> 42:34.190
because there's an evil spirit
called gluten in it?

42:34.230 --> 42:37.220
-It's not an evil spirit...
-What is it?

42:39.190 --> 42:44.080
-Fine, just give me the damn sandwich.
-Gluten!

42:44.120 --> 42:47.110
Hey, come on!

43:18.020 --> 43:20.040
-Shit!
-What the fuck?

43:20.080 --> 43:22.000
Isn't that the woman?

43:24.140 --> 43:28.050
-When is this?
-Over 4 hours before she was killed.

43:28.090 --> 43:33.150
How the hell can she be there
several hours before she timeigrated?
