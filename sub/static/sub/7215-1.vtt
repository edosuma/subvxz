WEBVTT

03:37.133 --> 03:38.383
Okay, okay, I can see him.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.095
- That's it. Here he comes.
- Careful.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.223
All right. I got him. I got him.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.016
- Sensors.
- Ahem.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.602
- Vitals?
- Stable.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.187
- Clamp.
- Scissors.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.980
Scissors.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.858
Severing umbilical.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.110
Umbilical cut. Okay, clear.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.154
Wait. Dropping fast. BP's dropping fast.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.406
Respirations are slow,
shallow, and irregular.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.618
O2 sat's down 82 percent.
BP 80 over 30. He's in V-tach!

04:04.786 --> 04:06.912
- Get the paddles.
- May I have some Dopamine?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.205
Dopamine.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.960
- I've got the paddles.
- Okay. Everybody clear.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.586
All clear.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.005
Clear!

04:21.844 --> 04:23.845
Heart rate's stable.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.229
Easy. Easy.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.065
Okay, we're good.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.781
No physical discrepancies.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.908
He's perfect.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.036
He's just perfect.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.001
I like Melvin.
He's much more of a Melvin.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.254
Somehow Ginger and Melvin
doesn't have quite the same ring to it.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.048
Okay, then, Fred it is.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.720
All right.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.850
Come on, little fella. Ahem.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.727
Look at that.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.645
He's so cute.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.949
All set?

05:26.117 --> 05:27.659
Let's do it.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.536
All right.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.750
- Okay.
- We're good.

05:35.835 --> 05:36.918
Nice.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.757
Ginger, meet Fred. Fred, meet Ginger.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.457
- What are they doing?
- Imprinting.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.515
See?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.558
Love at first sight.

06:49.450 --> 06:50.909
I wish you would fill me in.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.204
I like to think we're a team.
I like to think I'm a sounding board.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.833
- You're much more than that, Barlow.
- It's just another dog-and-pony show.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.961
- We could splice a dog and pony.
- They can take the meeting for us.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.004
Maybe I can help you with your publicity.

07:03.172 --> 07:07.092
"If God didn't want us to explore
his domain, why'd he give us the map?"

07:07.260 --> 07:08.510
Bumper-sticker wisdom.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.346
I get it, and I am totally with you guys
on every level.

07:11.514 --> 07:15.100
But Joan Charot can make or break
our project without even blinking.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.603
We should all be nervous,
as in survival-instinct nervous, so come on...

07:18.771 --> 07:20.397
...who's heads up?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.691
I don't want to spoil the surprise.
Come on.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.360
- You love surprises.
- No, surprises make me nauseous.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.655
Over the course of the last
three years, our lab has combined...

07:28.823 --> 07:33.160
...the DNA from a variety of species
to create a completely new life form.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.997
And, as you know,
Ginger has exceeded all expectations...

07:37.165 --> 07:40.333
...in her ability to produce
medicinal proteins for livestock.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.044
What you don't know is that,
since the birth of Fred...

07:43.212 --> 07:45.255
...we have an upgraded
splicing technique...

07:45.423 --> 07:49.468
...which can be applied to the most
sophisticated of organisms, namely...

07:51.345 --> 07:53.054
...- human beings.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.390
Hold on. Let's not get
too far ahead of ourselves.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.893
By incorporating human DNA
into the hybrid template...

07:58.060 --> 08:01.730
...we can begin to address any number
of genetically-influenced diseases.

08:01.898 --> 08:07.068
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes,
even some forms of cancer.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.285
Well...

08:17.121 --> 08:21.249
I can't tell you how, um, excited we are.

08:22.418 --> 08:26.796
The entire board is thrilled
with the progress you've made...

08:27.256 --> 08:31.593
...which is why we are so anxious
to move on to phase two.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.263
- Phase two?
- The product stage.

08:35.515 --> 08:40.309
We need to isolate the gene in Ginger
and Fred that produces your magic protein.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.938
We are shutting down
the splicing facilities...

08:44.106 --> 08:46.608
...retooling your labs
for intensive chemical analysis.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.443
Shutting down?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.945
I don't understand.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.572
Uh, we're handing you
the medical breakthrough of the century.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.782
We could begin...

08:53.950 --> 08:56.618
Elsa! We all know that can't happen
right now.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.371
The moral outrage would be
completely out of control.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.874
I mean, regulators and politicians,
they'd tear us to pieces.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.338
Please.

09:09.131 --> 09:13.218
If we don't use human DNA now,
someone else will.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.143
Look, we'd love to go there.

09:22.687 --> 09:27.732
Shoot for incredible medical breakthroughs,
of course we would.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.152
You put a viable livestock product
on the shelves...

09:31.320 --> 09:35.991
...then we will talk about a 20-year plan
to save the world.

09:36.158 --> 09:40.328
Right now, we need to start phase two...

09:40.496 --> 09:44.165
...and you are the only ones who can do it.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.173
We could quit. Go to Hamilton-Splinter.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.342
Newstead owns our patents.
We'd lose everything.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.681
Well? What?

10:00.558 --> 10:04.519
I'm not spending the next five years
digging through pig shit for enteric proteins.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.280
Me neither.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.210
What's the profile?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.046
Jane Doe.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.716
Anonymous female donor.
Clean medical and heredity. The usual.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.760
A dime a dozen.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.262
One in a million.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.916
- It's not working.
- What enzyme are you using?

11:08.084 --> 11:10.085
It's not the cleavage.
They're digesting fine.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.294
So?

11:11.462 --> 11:13.963
The human Alu sequences
don't wanna bond with foreigners.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.758
So what? We'll use a ligase other than T4.
We'll make them.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.343
Oh, we'll just make them.

11:18.511 --> 11:23.264
Yeah, we will. You know why?
Because Wired doesn't interview losers.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.351
Sometimes I forget those
basic scientific principles.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.286
This retarded, fascist,
Ã¼ber music is the fucking problem.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.706
Got us thinking in circles.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.468
You're right.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.554
We have been dancing to the wrong beat.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.222
Try this.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.725
M3.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.400
It's not working.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.906
- Wait a second. It's happening.
- Why now?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.492
I don't know, but they're on fire.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.163
- We got the right temperature. The enzyme...
- They're changing partners.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.375
- Everyone dances with everyone.
- You are Bob fucking Fosse.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.968
All right.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.847
Biotechnology's most startling
breakthrough in decades...

12:46.390 --> 12:47.891
...on ice.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.311
Well, at least we know
we can do it, right?

12:54.231 --> 12:55.815
Elsa.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.193
Elsa, come on. What are you doing?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.321
Elsa.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.115
I'm too tired for this, Elsa.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.786
Come on. I don't have the energy
to play with you right now. Elsa?

13:07.953 --> 13:09.370
I'm not playing around with you.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.500
Come on. Hey!

13:15.711 --> 13:19.339
- What, did you recode the locks?
- I recoded the locks.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.758
Come on. Open the door.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.303
Elsa. Seriously.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.807
You see, this is what's known
in couples therapy as emotional hijacking.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.975
Elsa?

13:35.731 --> 13:39.192
Come on, this is illegal. We're gonna
go to jail for this. Open the door.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.570
Human cloning is illegal.
This won't be human, not entirely.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.447
What? What are you doing?

13:44.615 --> 13:46.407
Relax. We won't take it to term.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.035
We need to know if we can
generate a sustainable embryo.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.956
- Then we destroy it. No one will know.
- What's the point if you can't publish?

13:53.123 --> 13:56.793
To be sure we really did it.
To know for sure.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.920
You're telling me you don't need to know?

13:59.088 --> 14:02.590
This is not so simple.
There are moral considerations.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.677
Millions of people are suffering
and dying with no hope.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.637
We might have the key to saving them.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.639
What are the moral considerations
of that?

14:43.340 --> 14:45.550
- Fuck.
- Exactly.

15:24.381 --> 15:25.840
How's it coming, little brother?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.550
Good.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.594
How's Fred doing?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.679
Our boy is growing up into
a fine young man.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.016
And phase two?

15:35.184 --> 15:37.894
Don't worry. We'll nail that gene.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.648
Good man. Double helix. Ha, ha.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.858
Hey, uh, I can't help...

15:44.026 --> 15:47.070
...but wonder what you and Elsa
have been so busy with.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.239
Building you your very own
special friend, Gavin.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.283
Thank you.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.953
I have been so lonely.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.621
Not for long.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.440
Come on, come on, come on.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.884
Can you not do that?

16:53.887 --> 16:55.763
Can you not do that?

16:55.931 --> 16:58.433
- Hmm?
- Don't do that.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.560
- What?
- Don't do that.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.604
My Zeppelin interpolation, come on.
You don't like it?

17:03.772 --> 17:06.816
Zeppelin crashed and burned before
I was born.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.484
Check this out. It's near the distillery.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.320
I fucking love it.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.656
Yeah, it's cool.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.951
You don't sound that enthusiastic.

17:17.744 --> 17:20.788
I don't know, I just don't want to
move again any time soon.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.374
We've been here for seven years.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.627
No, I mean from that place.
It just doesn't seem big enough.

17:29.423 --> 17:34.052
It's twice the size of this apartment.
More than enough room for all our stuff.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.971
But, you know, for down the road.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.310
You are talking about a kid, aren't you?

17:43.103 --> 17:44.645
- That so unreasonable?
- Yeah.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.856
Because I'm the one who has to have it.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.025
Look, I love this place.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.987
I don't wanna bend my life to suit some
third party that doesn't even exist yet.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.156
Come on. Come here.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.912
What's the worst that can happen?

18:02.456 --> 18:05.541
How about after we crack
male pregnancy?

18:05.709 --> 18:07.585
Ha, ha. And ruin this perfect figure?

18:07.753 --> 18:11.839
- You're a hypocrite. You're a hypocrite.
- No. You're a hypocrite.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.761
Who is it?

18:16.929 --> 18:18.513
Ignore it.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.057
- What?
- It's BETI.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.942
- Holy shit. What's going on?
- It's coming out.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.194
What? It can't do that.
It's not due for months.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.779
Well, tell that to the fetus.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.198
Oh, God, it's huge.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.200
- I thought you were keeping tabs.
- I was.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.619
It wasn't that big this morning.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.789
Too much pressure. It'll kill it.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.255
Okay. Okay, we're gonna
have to do this manually.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.050
It's not depressurizing.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.969
All right.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.227
Can you feel it?

19:06.395 --> 19:10.148
I can't. It's slippery. It's... Aah!

19:10.315 --> 19:11.732
What? What is it?

19:11.900 --> 19:14.277
- Aah!
- What? What? What is it?

19:14.444 --> 19:15.987
It's stinging.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.655
No, don't, don't.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.449
- Latch on. Come on.
- No, don't! Don't!

19:23.579 --> 19:25.788
All right, hold on. Hold on.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.089
Close your eyes.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.091
- What?
- Close your eyes!

19:44.725 --> 19:46.267
Hold still.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.644
Don't move.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.247
Aah!

20:11.293 --> 20:12.293
Look out, look out.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.970
Oh, my God.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.057
Hey, hey.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.061
Come on, come on. No, no, no.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.812
Oh, God.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.119
All right, don't worry.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.498
Hang on, hang on.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.672
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.674
Come on, come on, come on.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.636
You okay? You okay? Are you okay?

21:03.804 --> 21:05.388
What was that?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.224
What was that?

21:09.851 --> 21:11.227
A mistake.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.965
Do you think it's in pain?

21:42.217 --> 21:43.718
What?

21:44.219 --> 21:46.595
It's not formed right.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.057
We don't know that.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.146
I'm gonna kill it.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.981
Wait!

21:58.025 --> 22:00.234
There's still a lot we can learn.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.239
We can find out how close we came...

22:05.615 --> 22:07.908
...to something sustainable.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.911
Clive.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.080
It's okay.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.666
It's all right.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.629
It's not all right.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.132
It's wrong.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.060
Do we have to do this?

22:34.227 --> 22:37.646
You don't have to. I'll take care of it.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.793
Jesus, I think it's dead.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.836
What?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.257
Hold this.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.475
- Careful, careful.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.565
Yep.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.653
I'll bag it.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.196
Well...

23:28.490 --> 23:30.908
...at least it's not in pain now.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.244
Yeah.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.768
It's empty.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.070
Clive?

24:09.364 --> 24:10.739
Clive?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.242
Clive?

24:16.705 --> 24:18.164
Gavin.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.790
Clive!

24:37.893 --> 24:39.894
- What happened?
- It's alive.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.438
Oh, Jesus.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.441
Don't! Don't, don't! Lt'll get out.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.694
Shit!

24:56.828 --> 24:58.204
Shit.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.500
- Get out of there. I'm gonna gas it.
- Wait.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.169
Don't kill it.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.380
Elsa, get out, okay? I'm hitting the gas.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.136
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:14.763 --> 25:18.349
In three, two, one!

25:18.517 --> 25:21.268
Clive, I said don't!

25:21.436 --> 25:23.646
Put your fucking mask back on, Elsa!

25:24.439 --> 25:26.440
Listen! Goddamn it,
you never listen to me!

25:27.275 --> 25:29.818
Put your damn mask on! It's dangerous!

25:30.612 --> 25:32.404
Elsa, please.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.284
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.678
It's imprinting.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.978
You're really something, aren't you?

26:12.404 --> 26:15.072
Come on. Come on. Get out.

26:16.324 --> 26:18.242
Get out! Get out! How about listening?

26:22.497 --> 26:25.583
Are you crazy? Huh?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.251
I had the situation under control.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.337
You had it under control?
You're forgetting why we came here.

26:30.505 --> 26:34.174
You know what?
We can't do that now, all right? Look at it.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.676
What's that supposed to mean?

26:35.844 --> 26:38.846
Let's just knock it out with some ether,
find out what we've got.

27:14.924 --> 27:19.219
This is unbelievable.
I don't even know what half of this is.

27:19.596 --> 27:23.515
There must be some rogue elements.
Junk genes pushing through.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.686
Be careful with that.

27:30.899 --> 27:34.068
It's some kind
of self-defense mechanism.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.819
Yeah, or attack venom.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.739
None of her animal components
have predatory characteristics.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.534
Well, there's the human element.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.412
What are these?

27:46.122 --> 27:49.792
- Lungs?
- No. These are the lungs.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.919
Tumors?

27:53.505 --> 27:56.340
Well, I guess we'll find out
in the autopsy.

27:59.052 --> 28:02.554
This wasn't supposed to go this far.
It wasn't even supposed to go full-term.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.431
But it did.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.101
What happened to,
"We're just gonna prove we can do it"?

28:07.268 --> 28:10.396
So, what are you saying?
You really gonna kill it? Hmm?

28:10.563 --> 28:11.897
Do you think you can do that?

28:16.111 --> 28:17.695
Look.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.573
It's growing fast.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.450
Yeah. It's aging fast.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.619
Days within a matter of minutes.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.038
- You think it's the Ambystoma gene?
- It might be.

28:28.623 --> 28:31.709
The point is, this thing's
gonna die soon anyway.

28:31.876 --> 28:36.255
We're gonna get to observe its entire
life-cycle in compressed time.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.632
We'll never get an opportunity
like this again.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.969
So it's dying.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.639
She's dying. All by herself.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.709
Estrogen level's been low these days.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.253
What?

29:17.088 --> 29:18.672
How long?

29:18.840 --> 29:22.092
What are you talking about? What do
you mean, "these days"? Are you sure?

29:22.260 --> 29:24.011
Of course. I did all the tests.

29:24.179 --> 29:28.682
The progesterone, testosterone, estradiol.
It's all in the logs.

29:31.144 --> 29:35.355
I'm sorry. I've had a, uh...
I'm a little worn out.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.203
So, uh, I guess that thing...

29:49.370 --> 29:53.749
...that experiment you got going on,
you're still not ready to talk about it?

29:58.505 --> 30:00.547
How do you listen to this crap?
What is this?

30:09.015 --> 30:12.017
- What were you saying?
- Nothing.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.487
Day seven.

30:23.655 --> 30:28.325
We've got H-50 on a diet of chlorophyll,
roughage, bean curd, and enriched starch.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.745
You're gonna eat this. You're gonna...

30:32.205 --> 30:35.582
Just a little bit, please. Okay?
Come on, just a little. Please.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.043
Just stop. Stop. Just stay still.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.920
She seems resistant to feeding...

30:40.088 --> 30:43.131
...though her rapid growth should
generate a proportionate appetite.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.967
You're gonna eat it. Eat it.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.969
Fuck!

30:48.721 --> 30:50.973
God, I can't take this thing anymore.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.934
This isn't gonna work.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.938
This is impossible.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.119
- Come on.
- Come on.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.371
- Bring it over here.
- Okay.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.957
- Listen, listen.
- Eat this. Eat, just eat it.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.459
- Good girl.
- Good. You're gonna eat that.

31:19.627 --> 31:22.004
Good. See? See?

31:23.381 --> 31:25.132
This isn't gonna work.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.552
She makes too much noise.
People will notice.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.805
- And she stinks.
- We'll just feed her with a drip.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.350
How you gonna feed her with a drip?
She'll rip it right out.

32:15.558 --> 32:17.351
Come on.

32:17.518 --> 32:18.810
Try it.

32:30.698 --> 32:33.200
Tracking her feeding habits,
we've determined...

32:33.368 --> 32:38.038
...that the H-50 craves
high-sucrose foodstuffs.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.896
Elsa couldn't make it?

33:04.440 --> 33:06.900
She's at the lab, holding things together.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.405
She's, um, not very happy
with the new directive, is she?

33:12.073 --> 33:14.700
It was our facility.
We were supposed to have autonomy.

33:14.867 --> 33:15.909
I know.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.413
And, um, I am sorry.

33:24.419 --> 33:30.048
Truth is, if we don't start projecting profits,
big profits, soon...

33:30.216 --> 33:31.758
...Newstead's in serious trouble.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.345
We need capitalization
to move forward...

33:35.513 --> 33:39.641
...which means that phase two is
not just an option, it's all we've got.

33:39.809 --> 33:43.437
If Ginger and Fred don't hit a homerun
at the shareholders' presentation...

33:43.604 --> 33:45.814
...we might not even have that.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.025
We won't let you down.

34:34.322 --> 34:38.699
In the first month since her birth,
the H-50 continues to evolve rapidly.

34:38.868 --> 34:41.745
Emergence of arms and the closing seam
that bisects her body...

34:41.913 --> 34:45.206
...suggests that she develops
like a fetus outside the womb.

34:46.167 --> 34:50.337
Early cognitive recognition tests
indicate growing intelligence.

34:50.505 --> 34:54.424
Still, her mind remains
her greatest mystery.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.844
Where does it go?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.014
Where does the bear go?

35:05.019 --> 35:06.144
Yep.

35:06.312 --> 35:08.897
That's it. You got it again.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.191
You are such a good girl.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.448
You could do this all day, couldn't you?

35:18.616 --> 35:21.201
Okay. I'm gonna try something harder,
okay?

35:21.369 --> 35:23.578
So really concentrate.

35:25.790 --> 35:31.670
E-L-S-A.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.547
E-L-S-A. Elsa.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.216
E-L-S-A.

35:36.676 --> 35:37.759
Show me Elsa.

35:41.597 --> 35:42.973
That's it.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.236
Nerd?

35:57.822 --> 35:59.281
Yeah! I'm a nerd.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.741
Yeah, you made a connection.

36:01.909 --> 36:05.579
You are such a good girl. Oh, my God!

36:08.082 --> 36:09.124
She did it. Ha, ha.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.420
What's going on?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.046
She can associate.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.674
Why is the cover off her tail?

36:17.842 --> 36:20.177
What is she doing in this room?
You can't let her out.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.511
What's the problem?

36:21.679 --> 36:23.680
The problem?
Specimens need to be contained.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.933
- Don't call her that.
- What do you want me to call her?

36:29.812 --> 36:32.397
Dren. Dren.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.608
Her name's Dren.

36:37.111 --> 36:40.906
Listen, you're talking to her
like she's a...

36:42.450 --> 36:44.951
You're treating her like a...

36:45.494 --> 36:46.578
A pet.

36:47.079 --> 36:51.124
I'm compiling a developmental profile.
She needs more stimulation than that room.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.751
Oh, well, that's great.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.419
You know what Barlow said?

36:54.587 --> 36:57.297
They're renovating this entire wing,
tomorrow!

36:57.465 --> 37:00.842
So we move her to the storage room
downstairs. Nobody ever goes down there.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.636
How do you know nobody goes there?

37:02.803 --> 37:05.222
- Have you ever?
- Goddamn door.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.891
It's the best idea I've got.
What do you want me to say?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.976
What the hell do you mean by that?

37:10.144 --> 37:12.229
Your sarcasm's gonna help
when we get caught.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.147
We're not gonna get caught.

37:14.482 --> 37:18.360
Yeah, breakthroughs come from risk,
and so do people in prison!

37:18.527 --> 37:21.112
They go to jail because of risks!

37:22.281 --> 37:24.658
So you think they're gonna
renovate the storage room?

37:24.825 --> 37:27.494
What, they're gonna install
state-of-the-art mop racks?

37:27.662 --> 37:29.788
All they need to do is open the door.

37:31.832 --> 37:37.420
You're gonna risk our career on the fact
that somebody won't open a goddamn door?

37:37.588 --> 37:41.758
It's the best idea I've got, okay?
I mean, what else do you want me to say?

37:41.926 --> 37:45.387
Why are we taking all these risks
all of a sudden? What is going on?

37:45.554 --> 37:47.389
When did you get so fucking scared?

37:47.598 --> 37:49.724
When the fuck did you
stop being a scientist?!

37:52.728 --> 37:54.187
No!

37:54.355 --> 37:55.981
Stop! You go to your place.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.775
Go to your place!

38:07.034 --> 38:08.368
- No, Gavin.
- It's okay.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.578
- Get away from me.
- She's not gonna hurt you.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.713
Okay, so we have to deal with this.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.217
Come on.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.928
All right.

38:27.763 --> 38:31.725
It's okay, Dren. It's all right.
It'll just be a minute, all right? Shh, shh.

38:31.892 --> 38:34.436
- I don't know about this.
- You got a better idea?

38:34.603 --> 38:37.063
Go, go, go open the door.

38:37.481 --> 38:38.565
You stop it. Shh.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.326
Starting to feel like a criminal.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.245
Scientists push boundaries.
At least the important ones do.

38:52.913 --> 38:56.124
Sticking to a few rules isn't always
such a bad idea either, you know.

38:56.292 --> 39:00.045
Nobody is gonna care about a few rules
after they see what we have made.

39:00.629 --> 39:01.838
"See what we've made"?

39:02.006 --> 39:04.299
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.092
Nobody can see what we made.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.429
Once they see Ginger and Fred,
the world will wanna know what's next.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.933
Do you think they could
really look at this face...

39:14.101 --> 39:16.186
...and see anything less than a miracle?

39:18.856 --> 39:21.733
Oh. Oh. Oh, sweetie.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.278
Sweetie, you're sick, oh, no.
Clive, she's really hot.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.035
I've gotta talk to my brother.

39:44.799 --> 39:49.052
I know it's crazy,
but I need your support on this.

39:50.179 --> 39:53.223
Do you know what happens
if you get caught?

39:55.142 --> 39:57.894
What am I supposed to do
if you go to jail?

39:58.062 --> 40:01.856
Do you know what happens to this place,
to everyone that depends on you?

40:02.024 --> 40:06.069
God, did you ever think about them?
About me?

40:08.739 --> 40:12.367
I mean, did you think at all,
or did you just do what she wanted?

40:12.618 --> 40:13.993
It wasn't like that.

40:14.161 --> 40:17.414
You could have stopped it at any time.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.417
You could have just said no to her.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.838
Try it some time.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.183
It's 105. This is serious.

40:37.351 --> 40:40.895
- You don't know that for sure.
- I know. Okay?

40:41.230 --> 40:42.856
- We have to do something.
- What?

40:43.023 --> 40:44.858
What are we supposed to do?

40:45.025 --> 40:47.694
- Well, we have to take her somewhere.
- What? That's crazy.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.195
Well, then do something!

40:50.364 --> 40:51.948
What?

40:53.534 --> 40:55.201
- Give her a Tylenol?
- Shh.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.705
Come on, we're biochemists,
we can handle this.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.373
How?

41:00.541 --> 41:02.542
Fuck! How?

41:03.043 --> 41:05.920
- What do you do for a fever?
- Cold bath.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.469
Hurry. Hurry!

41:12.678 --> 41:15.889
Come on. Okay, sweetie. Shh.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.223
All right, you got her?

41:17.391 --> 41:19.767
Okay, yeah, I got her. Okay, it's okay.

41:22.229 --> 41:24.314
- Try to be still, okay? I know, I know.
- Aah!

41:24.482 --> 41:26.608
Dren, Dren, you have to settle down,
okay?

41:27.151 --> 41:29.569
- Try to be still.
- It's all right, it's okay.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.573
Jesus, her passages are closing.
She can't breathe. Do something!

41:33.741 --> 41:35.408
- What?
- I don't know!

41:35.576 --> 41:37.035
- A tracheotomy.
- With what?

41:37.203 --> 41:38.244
In the lab.

41:38.412 --> 41:41.372
But there's no time. Look at her!
She's dying!

41:41.540 --> 41:43.249
Dren, try to look at me. Look at me!

41:43.417 --> 41:46.628
Dren! Look right at me. Good girl, good girl.
Look at me, look at me.

41:46.795 --> 41:51.591
Now try to breathe. I want you to look
right at me. Dren, look right at me.

41:51.759 --> 41:55.094
Try to look at me!
Please, Dren, try to look at me.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.723
What are you doing? Let her go!

41:59.266 --> 42:02.435
Let her go! Stop it! You're killing her.
Let her go!

42:03.062 --> 42:09.108
Let her go, please! Clive! Just let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!

42:10.027 --> 42:12.820
Stop it, Clive! Let her go! You're ki...

42:12.988 --> 42:14.239
Stop it!

42:14.448 --> 42:17.283
Please let her go! Please let her go!

42:56.448 --> 42:58.199
She's breathing.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.119
She's breathing.

43:03.163 --> 43:06.708
Those weren't tumors.
She has amphibious lungs.

43:07.501 --> 43:10.420
You saved her. But how did you know?

43:14.842 --> 43:16.342
You did know, right?

43:17.595 --> 43:18.678
Yeah.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.225
Anyway...

43:25.311 --> 43:29.689
We can't mess around anymore.
We have to clean this place up, make it safe.

43:31.483 --> 43:32.775
Yeah.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.695
Yeah, I think we can do that.

43:41.368 --> 43:44.537
Sweetie, you have been
such a good girl lately.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.956
I have something special for you.

43:50.586 --> 43:53.546
Hi. I'm Jenny.

43:53.714 --> 43:57.425
I like cute guys, fast cars,
and funny little creatures like you.

43:58.802 --> 44:01.054
She was my secret friend.

44:02.181 --> 44:06.726
I wasn't allowed to have her,
so I had to keep her hidden, just like you.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.030
Good night, sweetie.

44:47.101 --> 44:50.603
She's had a big day.
She's gonna be out like a light.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.572
It's been a long time.

45:01.740 --> 45:05.618
My God, I didn't even notice.
Is that what happens?

45:05.786 --> 45:08.788
- To couples when they...
- When they work too hard? Ha, ha.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.208
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

45:15.087 --> 45:16.379
Hi there.

45:16.922 --> 45:18.172
Hey.

45:25.055 --> 45:26.973
What do we have here?

45:28.934 --> 45:30.143
All right.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.146
We have to be quiet.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.154
L... We don't have any, uh...

45:42.489 --> 45:44.031
What's the worst that could happen?

45:55.502 --> 45:57.003
Shit.

46:39.338 --> 46:45.259
Here is a couple unlike any other
we've seen before.

46:46.220 --> 46:50.056
That they are completely unique
in the world...

46:50.224 --> 46:52.308
...is more than just fate...

46:52.684 --> 46:54.769
...more than just luck.

46:54.937 --> 46:57.230
It is by design.

47:07.574 --> 47:11.577
Now let me present to you the minds
behind the design.

47:12.746 --> 47:15.581
Splice masters extraordinaire...

47:15.916 --> 47:19.126
...Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast!

47:25.592 --> 47:27.301
Thank you. Ahem.

47:27.469 --> 47:28.761
Thank you very much.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.388
Thank you.

47:32.558 --> 47:34.433
There's been a lot of talk tonight...

47:34.685 --> 47:37.770
...about advancements in, uh,
multispecies morphogens.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.648
We've talked about our new
protein-based compounds...

47:41.316 --> 47:43.734
...disease-fighting agents for livestock.

47:43.902 --> 47:46.654
And that's all very exciting
for everyone at Newstead.

47:46.822 --> 47:48.573
But let's be honest.

47:48.740 --> 47:51.284
What's exciting for you people
here tonight...

47:51.451 --> 47:56.122
...is to see these two creatures,
alive and in the flesh.

47:58.834 --> 48:04.046
These are state-of-the-art designer
organisms, the first of their kind.

48:04.756 --> 48:07.133
The origin of a species.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.552
Male and female.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.138
- Like Adam and Eve...
- Raise the barrier.

48:12.306 --> 48:16.601
...coming together to enact nature's
timeless story of love.

48:32.534 --> 48:33.826
Do something.

49:00.812 --> 49:02.104
Uh...

49:13.909 --> 49:19.205
Well, I think we have to agree that
this is a setback in terms of how...

49:19.373 --> 49:21.123
It's a fucking disaster.

49:21.750 --> 49:23.584
What happened?

49:25.754 --> 49:29.715
Well, it was difficult to examine
the remains...

49:31.718 --> 49:35.888
...but it seems that Ginger
has undergone certain...

49:36.056 --> 49:37.431
Hormonal changes.

49:38.141 --> 49:39.558
Hormonal changes?

49:39.726 --> 49:41.560
She turned into a male.

49:46.733 --> 49:49.568
What? Just like that? Just changed sex?

49:50.570 --> 49:52.238
But how can this happen?

49:53.073 --> 49:56.117
We really don't know...

49:56.284 --> 49:59.870
...but clearly, two males caged together
and stressed is a...

50:00.038 --> 50:05.251
So your first living hybrid changes sex,
and you didn't notice?

50:05.419 --> 50:07.003
How is that possible?

50:07.170 --> 50:09.422
We can re-create them.
No reason not to start over.

50:13.218 --> 50:15.219
No more monsters.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.639
We don't have time for that.

50:19.099 --> 50:25.104
We need the gene that produces CD356,
and we need it now.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.481
Do you understand?

50:31.236 --> 50:33.904
- We have to get it out of here.
- Yeah, and take her where?

50:34.072 --> 50:37.616
Barlow's taking over every inch
of this place, man. He'll find it.

50:37.784 --> 50:40.119
Gotta find some place,
like, away from everything.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.871
What am I not getting here?

50:42.039 --> 50:44.707
What did you expect when you made it?
Didn't you have a plan?

50:44.875 --> 50:46.959
Listen, brother,
we wouldn't be in this mess...

50:47.127 --> 50:50.463
...if you'd been paying enough attention
to observe a fucking gender change!

50:50.630 --> 50:51.964
And where were you, maestro?

50:52.132 --> 50:55.051
I was playing catch-up with
all the work you weren't doing!

50:55.218 --> 50:57.720
- I know a place.
- All you had to do was track data...

50:57.888 --> 50:59.472
I know a place we can take her.

51:06.605 --> 51:09.523
All these years you've owned this farm,
and you never mentioned it?

51:09.691 --> 51:13.069
- You knew I grew up on a farm.
- Yeah, I didn't know you still had it.

51:13.236 --> 51:16.572
It's not my farm. It was hers.

51:16.740 --> 51:19.992
- She's dead.
- So is the farm.

51:33.131 --> 51:36.467
It's all right, sweetie.
We'll have you out in a minute, okay?

51:43.350 --> 51:46.268
You know, you can talk to me
about your mother.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.562
I don't even want to think about her.

51:48.730 --> 51:50.231
I just want to understand.

51:50.398 --> 51:53.859
If you could understand crazy,
it wouldn't be crazy.

52:24.224 --> 52:27.560
It's okay, honey.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

52:28.061 --> 52:30.062
This is your new home now.

52:31.898 --> 52:33.649
This is your new home.

52:34.526 --> 52:35.901
Come on. It's okay.

52:37.195 --> 52:39.405
- No, no.
- What is it? What is it? Come on.

52:39.614 --> 52:42.449
- It's just a barn.
- Dren. It's all right. Dren.

52:42.617 --> 52:43.951
Come with us.

52:47.873 --> 52:48.914
Dren!

52:51.334 --> 52:52.459
Dren!

52:52.919 --> 52:54.253
Dren!

52:55.088 --> 52:57.840
Everything's fine.
Everything's under control, huh?

52:58.008 --> 52:59.216
Is it really under control now?

52:59.384 --> 53:02.428
Okay, you know what? I need you
to calm down. We just need to focus.

53:02.596 --> 53:05.598
Unbelievable. This is the disaster
everyone warns about.

53:05.765 --> 53:08.017
A new species set loose in the world.

53:08.185 --> 53:10.769
Don't worry, all right?
She's not gonna leave us.

53:10.937 --> 53:12.104
- She just did.
- Okay.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.524
You know what? We're gonna find her.
She's not gonna go far. Shh, shh, shh.

53:19.070 --> 53:20.279
Where is it?

53:24.201 --> 53:25.242
Go, go, go.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.414
Dren?

53:35.921 --> 53:37.213
Dren?

53:42.719 --> 53:45.387
- Dren, honey?
- I think she's hurt.

53:49.351 --> 53:51.143
Oh, Dren.

53:55.690 --> 53:56.815
Ugh.

54:00.528 --> 54:02.529
Ah.

54:07.619 --> 54:09.411
It's almost full.

54:14.584 --> 54:15.834
Dren...

54:16.753 --> 54:19.213
...you must never, ever run off
on me like that again.

54:19.381 --> 54:20.547
Do you understand?

54:21.132 --> 54:24.426
Do you understand? Dren, look at me.
That was bad.

54:24.594 --> 54:26.178
Bad Dren!

54:29.683 --> 54:31.225
Look, I'm...

54:31.726 --> 54:36.188
I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm not angry at you.
I was just... I was really worried.

54:40.193 --> 54:46.031
Well, it ain't the W,
but it's got a kind of rustic charm.

54:47.075 --> 54:48.784
You okay, Dren?

54:49.953 --> 54:51.245
Got a little blanket for you.

54:52.289 --> 54:53.664
Aah!

54:55.583 --> 54:56.875
Dren!

55:01.381 --> 55:03.215
Maybe we should move her
into the house.

55:03.383 --> 55:06.218
No way. Come on,
someone's gonna see her there.

55:06.386 --> 55:09.179
No, that's fine.
She needs a place to be in water.

55:09.889 --> 55:12.683
She's just upset. Everything's new.

55:14.019 --> 55:15.352
It'll be okay.

55:16.396 --> 55:20.232
Come on, let's move in. It's late.
Okay? Come on.

55:26.573 --> 55:27.865
You okay?

55:28.408 --> 55:31.076
Yeah, of course. It's just a house.

56:09.991 --> 56:12.951
- This was your room?
- Mm-hm.

56:13.411 --> 56:16.622
I thought you said your mom left it
just the way it was.

56:18.249 --> 56:19.541
She did.

56:38.144 --> 56:39.686
Nice of you to show up.

56:40.355 --> 56:41.438
Traffic.

56:41.606 --> 56:44.858
You will observe protocol. It's the only way
we're gonna beat this thing.

56:45.235 --> 56:49.238
Thank you. Shall we, um, get to work?

59:17.637 --> 59:20.806
Please, honey, not today.
Eat your dinner, okay?

59:20.974 --> 59:23.809
She doesn't like that stuff.
Maybe she wants meat.

59:23.977 --> 59:25.894
She doesn't eat meat.

59:27.063 --> 59:29.147
I'm sorry, is rabbit considered
a vegetable?

59:29.899 --> 59:31.316
That was an accident.

59:32.735 --> 59:36.446
Come on. Honey. I know you're hungry.

59:36.614 --> 59:37.906
Eat your di...

59:38.074 --> 59:39.866
What is it?

59:40.034 --> 59:42.077
What's the matter? What?

59:42.912 --> 59:45.163
Tedi... She spelled "tedious."

59:49.168 --> 59:51.753
- Where would she get a word like that?
- I don't know.

59:51.921 --> 59:54.506
She's telling us she's bored.
She's been stuck here a week.

59:54.674 --> 59:56.341
Do you want to play a game, sweetie?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.102
Holy shit. How did you...?

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:11.523
Dren, I know, but I'm sorry, you can't
go outside. You know, you just can't.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:16.028
- Dren! No, Dren! Stop it!
- Hey, cut it out.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.696
Dren, stop it!

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.531
Dren, okay, take it easy.

01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:22.951
- Okay, hey.
- You know what?

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:25.746
That's it. You come over here
right now and sit down!

01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:28.206
- Elsa! Cool it.
- Sit down!

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:30.042
- You saw what she did!
- Come on.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.169
Did you not see what she did? Fuck!

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.921
I did. Stop, it's okay. It's okay.

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:37.215
- It's done.
- She's getting so hard to control...

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:41.595
Dren, stop!

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:51.855
Be careful.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.279
- Dren?
- Dren?

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:03.659
Dren?

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.748
- Dren?
- Dren?

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.083
Dren, come back here!

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.918
Dren, sweetie?

01:01:13.127 --> 01:01:16.630
Come on, sweetie. Come back inside.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.632
Dren, we're not angry.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:25.597
- Dren, get back here this instant!
- Watch it, watch it, watch...

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.183
- No!
- No!

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:49.621
Dren! Dren, don't, don't. We need you.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.123
Dren...

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.625
...we love you.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:06.638
Come here.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.991
Elsa not here yet?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.367
Not feeling well.

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.828
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:32.581
People get sick. It happens.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:36.084
A lot of people would just
suck it up, you know, rise to the occasion?

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:40.589
You guys are not some special case,
not anymore.

01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:43.925
Fucking idiot.

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:48.972
My mother wouldn't let me wear makeup.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.391
She said that it debased women.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:56.855
But who doesn't wanna be debased
every once in a while?

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.107
Look.

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.987
You see how pretty you've become?

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:08.200
You're gonna have to learn
how to be a grownup.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.370
I remember how I felt at your age.

01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:15.832
It's an exciting time.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.629
I never thought it...

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:26.593
Maybe we could use some, uh,
more eyeliner, hmm?

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:29.054
Let's try some more eyeliner.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.227
What are these?

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.188
Did you do these?

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.068
These are really good.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.070
Are there any of me?

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:04.631
Dren, what is that?
Where did you get that?

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.091
Give it to me.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:09.928
Give it to me, right now.
Dren, you give that to me.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.431
Sorry. You can't keep her.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:15.642
We can't take a chance.
It could make you sick.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.113
Can't always get what you want.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.448
That's a part of growing up too.

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:52.220
Elsa?

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:18.288
Dren?

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.834
Shit.

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:27.881
Hey. What's the matter, girl?

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.429
What happened?

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:37.974
Did Elsa do that?

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.144
Looks nice.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:49.527
Well, let's lighten things up around here,
shall we?

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:56.076
That's good. That's really good.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.420
Ah. Ha, ha.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:11.967
You like that?

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.677
It's music.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:22.060
It's fun, huh? Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.062
It's music.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:27.941
Come on, it's just music. Feel that?
It makes you feel good.

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:33.071
Feels better. Yeah, yeah. Let it out.
Good. Come on, come on.

01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:36.700
Good. Very good. Good.

01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:39.411
That's dancing.
Okay, that's kind of a dance.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:44.958
Okay, look, look, look. Look at my feet.
Watch my feet. The feet.

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:48.503
Okay, ready, one...
Look, you're doing good.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.047
Step, step.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:07:00.640
Very good. Ooh, look at you. I knew we got
the dance gene in there somewhere.

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:03.893
Give me your hand. Hold my hand.

01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:06.813
Good.

01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:13.028
That's nice. Okay, hand there.
Put it here. Very good.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.780
Okay, I'm gonna lead, okay?
I'm the man, I lead.

01:07:15.948 --> 01:07:18.616
The man leads, okay?
So back up, back up, one more.

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:22.787
One, that's it, that's it. Good, good, good.
That's it, one more.

01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:24.748
Good. Back up, back up, good.

01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:29.002
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, turn this side.
Okay, good, back up, back up. Okay.

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:32.797
You're a good dancer.

01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:38.386
You're very good.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:41.389
Look at you.

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:10.335
Elsa.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:14.672
That's enough.
That's enough dancing, Dren.

01:08:18.676 --> 01:08:20.053
Good night.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.365
Thought I was taking a quick nap.

01:08:43.327 --> 01:08:45.828
I must have slept like a rock.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.207
What?

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:54.712
It's your DNA.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:56.714
What?

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.510
In Dren.

01:09:01.636 --> 01:09:03.429
I can tell.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.808
You put yourself into the experiment?

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:09.894
How could you...? Ha, ha.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:15.316
What...? What were you...?
I mean, was this ever about science?

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.068
Of course it was. It still is.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.408
If you believe that, you're even more
fucked up than I think you are.

01:09:23.742 --> 01:09:26.118
Uh, what is that supposed to mean?

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:29.788
Maybe you ought to take another look
at your family history.

01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:51.435
Dren?

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:54.272
Dren?

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.662
Hey, Dren.

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:13.291
I have something for you. Come here.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:19.297
Come here. I wanna give you something.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.936
Can't you smile for me?

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:37.482
You know I love you, don't you?

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.154
You're a part of me.

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:47.450
And I'm a part of you.

01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:51.955
I'm inside you.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.500
I have something for you.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.007
Look what I got.

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:04.759
You can keep her.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:07.512
Why not?

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:09.931
It's nice to have a pet.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:19.023
Oh, my God!

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:20.566
Dren!

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.397
Physically, H-50 has evolved well.

01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:01.524
However...

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:05.570
...recent violent behavior suggests
dangerous psychological developments.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:11.784
Erratic behavior may be caused by
a disproportionate species identification.

01:12:11.952 --> 01:12:16.205
Cosmetically human affectation
should be eliminated wherever possible.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.405
Due to her unstable condition,
it has become necessary...

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:33.574
...to remove her zootoxin glands
and stinger.

01:14:22.749 --> 01:14:25.001
- What are you doing?
- What I had to.

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:31.883
Jesus Christ. Elsa.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:37.597
She's become unstable. She killed the cat.
She almost killed me.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:40.641
So you cut off her tail?

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:43.478
You any closer to finding the protein?

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:46.397
What does that have to do
with anything?

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:50.818
You haven't, because you're working with
tissue that's been dead too long.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.779
- You don't know she has it.
- Of course she does.

01:14:53.947 --> 01:14:56.991
She has everything Ginger and Fred
had and more.

01:14:58.076 --> 01:14:59.410
Where are you going?

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:04.415
I'm gonna solve this thing.
I'm gonna put things right.

01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:20.473
I'm sorry.

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:23.476
Dren.

01:15:27.564 --> 01:15:29.607
Dren, I'm...

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:32.670
Where are you?

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.752
Bill, you're early.

01:17:13.211 --> 01:17:15.046
Let me get this straight.

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:19.216
You stay home because you're sick,
and now I find you sneaking around.

01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:21.719
- Making up for lost time.
- It's too late for that.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.472
They won't extend the deadline. It's over.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.057
You screwed us all.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.477
- In fact, clear out Clive's desk.
- I don't think so.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.063
Well, no one cares
what you think anymore.

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:34.273
You're an embarrassment
to this company. It's...

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:36.275
The protein's been synthesized.

01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:38.444
It's in the fridge.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:42.573
When some real scientists get here,
have them take a look.

01:17:58.423 --> 01:17:59.924
Ouch.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:21.112
Elsa?

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:35.000
No, no! No!

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:38.129
No. You can't do that. You...

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:48.055
You shouldn't do that.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.022
You shouldn't do that.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.852
Oh, God.

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:47.198
Oh, shit.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.522
- EI.
- Don't.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.441
Don't.

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:15.763
I don't even quite know how it happened.
I was barely...

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.098
I don't even know who you are anymore.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.060
You've become something sick.

01:22:22.687 --> 01:22:26.899
Forget about what it means to me,
there are some things you do not do!

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:29.818
We changed the rules.

01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:33.030
You're not talking your way out of this.

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:40.329
We crossed a line
and things got confused.

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.623
Confused about what?

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.043
Right and wrong.

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:48.796
Right and wrong.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:52.716
Do you have any idea how
naive that sounds?

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:56.428
You're in no position to talk to me
about right and wrong!

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:59.056
And you are?

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:01.100
Really?

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:05.854
Why the fuck did you wanna make her
in the first place?

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:07.773
Huh?

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:10.234
For the betterment of mankind?

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:18.409
You never wanted a normal child...

01:23:19.577 --> 01:23:22.246
...because you were afraid
of losing control.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.544
But an experiment, that's something else.

01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:31.880
I love her.

01:23:32.048 --> 01:23:35.342
Yeah, I know, but we fucked up, EI.

01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:40.597
We fucked up.

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:46.854
Jesus Christ. We've chained her up.
We locked her away from the world.

01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:49.440
We maimed her.

01:23:51.985 --> 01:23:53.944
I maimed her.

01:23:56.781 --> 01:24:00.242
I just wish things could go back
to the way they were.

01:24:13.673 --> 01:24:16.133
I synthesized the protein.

01:24:18.511 --> 01:24:19.678
What?

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.472
She has a derivative.

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:25.267
It's more stable than CD356.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.687
It's 10 times higher than the level
Ginger and Fred ever had.

01:24:42.285 --> 01:24:43.994
We could maybe save things.

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:48.332
I don't mean us. I mean...

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:52.377
Oh, God, we can't do that.

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.172
We can't. We have a responsibility.

01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:59.802
Experiment's over.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:03.847
Our responsibility is to end it.

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:21.865
Dren?

01:25:24.035 --> 01:25:25.619
Dren?

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:29.456
Come out, Dren.

01:25:39.175 --> 01:25:40.551
Dren?

01:26:03.908 --> 01:26:06.076
- Clive!
- What?

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:13.292
What's happening?

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:19.423
I don't know, but she's dying.

01:27:07.096 --> 01:27:08.430
Do you, uh...

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:11.475
...wanna say anything?

01:28:23.756 --> 01:28:25.841
- Almost done?
- Yeah, almost.

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:33.682
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:53.327
What...? Gavin, what are you doing here?

01:28:53.536 --> 01:28:55.704
I'm sorry. I had to.

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:57.914
It's the only way.

01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:04.755
All right. Let's see it.

01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:07.799
- What did you tell him?
- I didn't have to tell him much.

01:29:07.967 --> 01:29:09.593
You think I'm stupid?

01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:12.888
The samples you gave me
had human DNA content.

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:16.141
They didn't come from Ginger and Fred,
they came from something else...

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:18.018
...something that's still alive.

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:21.104
And to think you did this on my watch.

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:24.232
Now, let's see this thing.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.525
It doesn't belong to you.

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:27.277
It doesn't belong to anyone.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:28.904
Where is it?

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:42.959
Fine.

01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.628
I'm calling a forensic team.

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.296
She's already dead.

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:49.132
It's over.

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:55.138
- I don't believe you.
- No?

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.892
Well, see for yourself.
She's buried behind the barn.

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.158
Oh, shit.

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:27.421
What the fuck is going on?

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.550
Dren?

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:49.276
Gavin!

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:53.280
Gavin!

01:30:54.198 --> 01:30:56.491
Gav! Gavin!

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:59.244
Aah. Gavin!

01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:01.955
Clive, stop!

01:31:04.041 --> 01:31:06.042
- Shit.
- We have to go back!

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.462
- Gavin?
- We have to go back.

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:11.256
Clive, Clive, Clive.

01:31:11.424 --> 01:31:13.717
- I can't, I have to... I can't.
- Look, he's gone.

01:31:13.885 --> 01:31:17.179
No, look, we can't stay here, okay?
It's out there.

01:31:17.346 --> 01:31:18.430
What happened?

01:31:19.098 --> 01:31:22.142
Ginger. It's the same thing that
happened with Fred and Ginger.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.728
- Okay, now, let's go.
- I'm not leaving my brother.

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:26.563
He's dead, okay? He's already dead!

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:29.065
- I'm not leaving my brother!
- Let's go!

01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:31.902
No!

01:31:33.237 --> 01:31:34.905
- Just let it go.
- We need it.

01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:37.199
- Clive, let it go!
- We need it. Aah!

01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:39.826
We gotta go.

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:42.329
Almost.

01:31:43.873 --> 01:31:45.248
Almost have it.

01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:52.964
I got it!

01:31:56.928 --> 01:31:59.930
Clive! Clive! Clive!

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:03.183
Clive!

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:06.144
Clive.

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:15.654
Clive.

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:20.450
Grab my hand. Grab my...

01:32:28.292 --> 01:32:33.630
Okay, okay, now, get up, because
we need to go now. We need to go.

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:36.174
I know, it's okay. Okay. Okay.

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:20.028
What do you want?

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:21.738
What do you want?

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.122
Inside...

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:36.753
...you.

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:23.461
Your Dren turned out to be...

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:27.340
...a cauldron of unimaginable
chemical mysteries.

01:37:28.592 --> 01:37:35.306
Aside from the intense concentration
of CD356 in her system...

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:41.312
...she was filled with a variety
of completely unique compounds.

01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:45.233
We'll be filing patents for years.

01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:51.155
Of course, we are extremely excited...

01:37:51.323 --> 01:37:55.076
...that you're willing to take us
to the next stage...

01:37:55.452 --> 01:37:59.789
...especially in light of the...

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.500
...personal risk.

01:38:05.504 --> 01:38:11.342
We think the figure we've come up with
is very generous.

01:38:20.227 --> 01:38:22.729
You can never speak of this...

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:27.775
...to anyone...

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:32.447
...ever.

01:39:01.727 --> 01:39:05.271
Nobody would blame you
if you didn't do this.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:10.526
You could just put an end to it
and walk away.

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:14.989
What's the worst that could happen?
