WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:09.884
Linda...

00:09.968 --> 00:12.887
You can have literally
anything you could--

00:13.430 --> 00:14.347
What the--

00:14.431 --> 00:18.184
<i>You sent a demon in disguise</i>
<i>as one of the subjects?</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:20.687
<i>This outrageous act must be punished.</i>

00:21.354 --> 00:23.565
<i>Chidi will be the fourth subject</i>
<i>in this experiment.</i>

00:25.817 --> 00:29.070
I still don't get why the Bad Place
would try something so obvious?

00:29.154 --> 00:31.239
They're desperate.
They know they're gonna lose.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.533
Plus, we can get rid of the Linda picture,

00:34.159 --> 00:38.246
and put a Chidi picture on the other side
since we know a ton about him.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.914
It's all good news, right, team leader?

00:39.998 --> 00:41.291
Yeah, it's super cool

00:41.374 --> 00:44.502
that I'm actively surveilling
and manipulating an ex-boyfriend.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.546
I mean, more so than I usually did.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.381
Okay, let's focus on Brent.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.342
Born on third base, thinks he invented
the game of baseball.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.345
Guys like this believe
that the world revolves around them,

00:54.429 --> 00:56.139
because it kinda does.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.767
If we could get him
to listen to anyone else,

00:58.850 --> 01:01.186
he'd hear how much better they are
than he was,

01:01.269 --> 01:04.147
which might make him realize
that he doesn't belong here,

01:04.230 --> 01:05.690
and also, bonus...

01:06.608 --> 01:08.693
maybe he cries like a stupid little baby.

01:15.742 --> 01:19.662
Anyway, long story short,
that's why there are still ducks.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.623
-I saved all the ducks.
- Aw!

01:22.207 --> 01:24.042
Incredible. Wow.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.877
Thank you, Wanda. What a life.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.464
Now we turn to our next guest,
Chidi Anagonye.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.927
Now, Chidi, you led an impressive life
as an academic.

01:34.010 --> 01:38.473
Uh, well, uh, not
save-an-entire-species impressive,

01:38.556 --> 01:42.435
but yes, I was a professor
of ethical and moral philosophy.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.063
I'm sorry. Literally every duck?

01:45.146 --> 01:47.440
-You saved every duck?
-In essence, yes.

01:48.107 --> 01:51.194
And I didn't mention this before,
I really don't like to brag,

01:51.277 --> 01:53.071
but also horses.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.239
-What?

01:54.322 --> 01:58.284
Man. I mean, compared to you,
I feel a little inadequate.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.123
Hey. Hey, Mikey, can I ask you something?

02:03.206 --> 02:06.584
I feel bad for making Janet's life
more chaotic and unpredictable.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.754
So, here's my idea to make it up to her.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.550
Me and 100 Janet babies
do a giant flash mob,

02:13.633 --> 02:16.302
just total unpredictable chaos
all around her.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.388
Great idea, right?

02:18.471 --> 02:21.266
-Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason.
-Mmm-hmm?

02:21.349 --> 02:24.185
Sorry, I put a little cheat code
in the neighborhood,

02:24.269 --> 02:26.563
where if I say your name five times,
my headache goes away.

02:26.646 --> 02:30.608
Do you know why I forced you to act
like a monk in the original neighborhood?

02:30.692 --> 02:33.236
-Does it have to do with the TV show <i>Monk?</i>
-No.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.657
It's because you have no control
over your own impulses.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.952
You think every problem can be solved
with a Molotov cocktail,

02:41.035 --> 02:44.289
or slashing somebody's tires
or plunging Derek.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.875
So, being a monk was torture for you.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.003
The only way for you
to repair your relationship with Janet

02:50.086 --> 02:51.838
is to give her some space.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.591
Show her that you can
control your impulses.

02:54.674 --> 03:00.722
So, you're saying wanting to do something
isn't a good reason to immediately do it?

03:02.640 --> 03:03.558
Yeah.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.852
Man! I wish someone
had taught me this on Earth.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.438
People tried. Mostly judges.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.648
Hey, showtime.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.777
And now, Brent Norwalk, why don't you
tell us a little bit about yourself?

03:15.361 --> 03:16.988
Thank you very much. Thank you.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.740
Sure. I'm pretty interesting.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.618
I grew up in Chicago. A suburb, obviously.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.037
I went to Princeton University.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.789
No handouts, by the way.
I earned my spot there.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.125
Just like my father
and his father before him.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.879
I then inherited the family business,
and in just 18 years,

03:32.962 --> 03:36.132
I grew Norwalk Materials
from a $90 million company...

03:36.966 --> 03:39.010
to a $94 million company.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.011
One second. Hey, Janet?

03:40.678 --> 03:41.763
-Hi, there.
-Perrier.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.601
Why don't you tell us
about a time when things

03:46.684 --> 03:48.061
-didn't come so easy to you?
- Mmm.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.938
Look, I've had my share
of disappointments.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.107
I smartly bought Netflix stock
at $38 a share,

03:53.191 --> 03:54.651
but I couldn't cash it in before I died.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.487
So, all that money's going to my dumb kid.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.155
But you have to press on, right?

03:59.239 --> 04:03.785
In the words of Martin Luther King Jr.,
who I personally believe was a great man,

04:04.535 --> 04:06.913
he said that, "When life knocks you
on your butt,

04:06.996 --> 04:08.957
you jump back up
and start throwing haymakers."

04:09.040 --> 04:11.334
-I'm not sure he said that.
-No, he did. You're wrong.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.505
For me, Eleanor, it's all about
taking personal responsibility.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.131
Not enough people do that.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.549
If you ask me,

04:18.633 --> 04:21.010
-that's what's wrong with this country.
-What country?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.346
This was fun, Eleanor,
but I have a tee time.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.181
Daddy no golfy, daddy get cranky.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.767
So, Chad, Duck Lady, nice to meet ya.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.935
- Thank you.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.436
Thank you all very much. You were great.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.438
A car?

04:33.648 --> 04:36.234
He got a car?

04:36.317 --> 04:38.111
Okay. Well, back to the drawing board.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.530
If we want him to understand
he doesn't belong here,

04:40.613 --> 04:42.156
we don't need a drawing board.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.367
We need to bust him open like a piñata.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.327
We tried that in the Bad Place.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.163
The goo that comes out
doesn't taste as good as candy.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.749
-No, dude, metaphorically.
-Ah.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.295
Although, there is another
Bad Place strategy

04:55.378 --> 04:57.005
that might work very well here.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.759
I don't know if that's the right move.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.553
It's our only move.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.764
And we're doing it tomorrow.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.022
What the...

05:14.731 --> 05:16.399
-Hey, Janet?

05:16.482 --> 05:17.567
Janet!

05:21.654 --> 05:23.031
Is that Perrier?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.993
<i>♪ Waiting for the break of day ♪</i>

05:30.038 --> 05:33.583
<i>♪ Searching for something to say ♪</i>

05:36.627 --> 05:37.754
Michael! Eleanor!

05:37.837 --> 05:40.715
Brent, I'm so sorry. We don't know
why all of this is happening.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.801
Well, I do.
This chaos is clearly all about me.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.471
This is the universe telling me
that I don't belong here.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.807
-Brent, what do you mean?
-I don't belong in the Good Place.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.936
I mean, obviously,
there's a place better than this.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.690
I belong there, in the Best Place.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.948
Walk me through this, Brent.
I'm not sure we follow.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.117
Well, I've been feeling this way
for a while now.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.703
I mean, this can't be all
the afterlife has to offer,

06:10.787 --> 06:12.663
not to the cream of the crop.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.166
I mean, if this is heaven,
then where are my guys?

06:15.249 --> 06:17.627
Where's Scotty and Schultzy and Porcupine?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.462
Where's White Guillermo,

06:19.545 --> 06:22.465
and where is Mexican William
and what about Squirtman?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.093
Well, he makes a good point.
What about Squirtman?

06:25.176 --> 06:28.554
Also, frankly, my assistant Janet
is a little uptight.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.473
I mean, she hasn't worn any of my gifts.

06:30.556 --> 06:34.143
Have you been asking Janet
to make herself clothes,

06:34.227 --> 06:36.395
that you give back to her?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.231
Yeah, you're doing the math
right there, bud.

06:38.314 --> 06:41.359
Look, this chaos, which is clearly
all about me, is a sign.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.320
If this is the Good Place,
I belong in the Best Place.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.573
So, figure it out, get back to me. Okay?

06:50.451 --> 06:52.787
I'm gonna go punch a wall with my head.
I'll meet up with you later.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.542
Michael, I'm afraid
we need to talk about Eleanor.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.294
I know what you're gonna say.
She's just been really busy.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.214
I'm sure she'll get around
to showering at some point.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.717
No, it's not that.
Although, it's not, not that.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.762
It's possible we need a new team leader.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.430
Oh, really?

07:11.514 --> 07:14.350
We just can't help but question
her decision-making.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.477
She balked at bringing
Chidi and Simone together.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.938
She ignored my concerns about Linda.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.232
Her plans for Brent backfired.

07:21.315 --> 07:25.445
We've made precious little progress.
Perhaps leadership isn't her forte.

07:25.528 --> 07:30.074
Yeah, I mean, Eleanor is dope,
but she keeps screwing everything up.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.286
That's my thing.
And you wouldn't put me in charge.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.496
Actually, that's a decent point.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.582
But think about what you're saying here.

07:37.665 --> 07:41.085
We have. We should at least discuss
pursuing a change in leadership.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.588
Yeah, definitely, let's pursue it.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.548
Oh, hey, Eleanor.

07:45.631 --> 07:50.511
We were just talking about how maybe
you shouldn't be team leader.

07:51.888 --> 07:52.763
Saved it.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.682
Go ahead, guys. Speak your mind.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.517
It isn't personal, Eleanor.

07:56.601 --> 08:01.063
When we started this experiment,
I calculated a 9% chance of success.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.859
After your first three days on the job,
it's down to 7.1%.

08:04.942 --> 08:09.572
So purely from a mathematical standpoint,
you are kind of pooching it.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.907
Very helpful feedback.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.534
And if I could give you some feedback,

08:13.618 --> 08:16.579
uh, I'd say that you're all
ungrateful ash-faces,

08:16.662 --> 08:19.373
who can shove your fat grumps
all the way up your snork-box.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.750
Which curses were those?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.210
I didn't ask for this.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.880
I'm only doing it because Michael,
who is supposed to be in charge,

08:25.963 --> 08:27.715
had a nervous breakdown
the second it started.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.467
But maybe you can do it better than me.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.761
Tahani can be in charge
since she's so smart.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.554
Or better yet, Jason.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.515
Maybe all of humanity can be saved

08:35.598 --> 08:38.309
with one good, old-fashioned
Jacksonville carnival.

08:38.392 --> 08:41.312
I mean, we could try.
All I need is a bouncy house,

08:41.395 --> 08:43.689
some ninja stars
and a bunch of ambulances.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.775
Well, good luck, fork-faces. I quit.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.652
Shellstrop out.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.284
You get it all out of your system?

08:55.368 --> 09:00.081
-You gonna come back, get to work?
-No, man, I meant what I said. I quit.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.126
I'm sorry you overheard that,
and they're sorry they said it.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.548
But you don't just
get to quit this, Eleanor.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.342
This is not your seventh-grade band,

09:11.425 --> 09:14.345
or three hours into
a two-week juice cleanse.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.305
A little more at stake here.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.433
Yeah, man, that's why I'm quitting.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.770
The things that are happening here
are above my pay grade.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.606
How do I get Brent
to stop being such a deckhead?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.442
How do I fix Simone when she's convinced

09:28.526 --> 09:30.903
all of this is happening
inside of her brain?

09:30.987 --> 09:34.532
Ooh, maybe I should drive her
into the arms of my ex-boyfriend?

09:34.615 --> 09:35.533
That sounds fun.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.451
What do I do about John, the gossip king,

09:37.535 --> 09:40.204
or the demon spy
who punched me in the face?

09:40.288 --> 09:41.205
And how do I do it all

09:41.289 --> 09:43.541
with a pleasant smile
to keep everyone's spirits up?

09:43.624 --> 09:45.751
I'm not meant for this.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.838
I'm not the freakin' savior
of the universe.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.256
I'm just...

09:52.383 --> 09:53.843
a girl from Arizona.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.054
That's it.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.098
I'm just a normal girl from Arizona.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.603
I ate junk food, I watched reality shows,

10:03.686 --> 10:06.522
I sometimes left H&M
wearing more underpants

10:06.606 --> 10:08.107
than I had on when I came in.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.527
I did a bad job of being in charge
of my own life,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.655
and now I'm supposed to be
in charge of everyone else's life? I...

10:15.865 --> 10:17.325
I cannot do this.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.543
When I started my experiment,

10:27.627 --> 10:32.923
I thought, "Four broken birdbrains
who will believe everything I tell them.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.301
This will be a breeze."

10:36.844 --> 10:38.471
You beat me in three months.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.724
"Okay, fine," I thought, "a fluke."

10:42.308 --> 10:44.810
You then you beat me 800 more times.

10:45.853 --> 10:50.524
Because human beings,
it turns out, are weird,

10:51.400 --> 10:55.071
and I will never truly understand
what it's like to be one.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.324
This is a job for a human.

10:59.950 --> 11:05.122
One who's tough, but also empathetic
and has a big heart,

11:06.290 --> 11:09.710
and a world-class bullshirt detector.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.046
You think you can't do this?

11:13.130 --> 11:17.510
Eleanor, you're the only one
who can do this.

11:18.928 --> 11:23.682
Like it or not, the only one
who can save humanity

11:23.766 --> 11:26.185
is a girl from Arizona.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.566
But everything I do blows up in my face.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.822
I'm like a hot, blonde Wile E. Coyote.

11:37.905 --> 11:38.906
That's true.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.535
About you making lots of mistakes,

11:42.618 --> 11:45.079
not the thing where
you sexualized a cartoon.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.957
Come on, you know how this works.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.128
You fail, and then you try something else,
and you fail again and again.

11:52.211 --> 11:56.006
And you fail 1,000 times,
and you keep trying,

11:56.090 --> 12:01.303
because maybe the 1,001st idea might work.

12:02.388 --> 12:07.393
Now, I'm gonna go and try to find
our 1,001st idea.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.646
I hope you'll join me.

12:12.106 --> 12:16.110
I hope you shower first and then join me.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.749
Ladies and gentlemen, back with her
trademark brand of B-minus leadership,

12:30.833 --> 12:32.084
Eleanor Shellstrop.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.963
We are so, so, so sorry, Eleanor.
We never should've questioned you.

12:36.046 --> 12:39.049
Don't worry about it, hot stuff.
I was questioning me, too.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.928
But I'm back, baby.
And I have a new idea for Brent.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.889
Guys like him never think they're wrong.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.433
So, we're gonna tell him he's right.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.227
Brent?

12:53.522 --> 12:56.484
This conversation
must remain confidential.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.361
-Okay.
-Obviously, you're a very smart guy.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.573
-Yes.
-But we need to know that we can trust you

13:02.656 --> 13:04.366
with sensitive information.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.618
You can.

13:05.701 --> 13:09.413
I routinely buried HR complaints.
So, no problem.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.834
The truth is, Brent, you figured us out.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.669
There is a Best Place.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.588
I knew it! I knew it.

13:17.671 --> 13:22.510
The Best Place is reserved for a select,
upper echelon of good people.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.639
Sort of like a Diamond Elite
VIP club of afterlife residents.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.058
I was Diamond Elite. I swear.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.352
One time, I did shots
with this pilot in the lounge.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.770
The guy let me fly his helicopter.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.855
-We know. That's how you died.
-Right.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.149
So, you'll all be evaluated,

13:37.233 --> 13:42.071
and then a very small group of the most
morally upstanding residents get to go.

13:42.154 --> 13:46.325
Oh, I see.
So, it's like a "good deeds" contest?

13:46.408 --> 13:48.619
That's easy. I'm gonna crush this.

13:48.702 --> 13:52.164
Oh, and hey, mum's the word, right?
Why tip off my competition?

13:53.332 --> 13:57.336
Oops! Looks like you dropped your fork.
Let me get that for you.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.589
Did you get that? The fork thing?
Or should I start writing these down?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.716
-You're good. We'll keep track.
-Great. Love it.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.595
-Hi, Jason.
-Janet.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.640
I'm so happy to see you.
I got you a box of chocolates.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.977
But then I remembered
you can't eat, so I ate them,

14:13.060 --> 14:16.146
and I thought it'd be a nice present
for me to describe them to you.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.650
So, the first one was gross--

14:19.733 --> 14:21.318
Jason, um, please just let me talk.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.364
You know that I've been overwhelmed
with work since the neighborhood started.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.700
-Yup.
-And I asked you to give me some space.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.244
Yup.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.037
I'm so sorry to say this...

14:33.956 --> 14:36.166
but I can't be
in a relationship with you right now.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.044
Being with you is fun,
but it's not always easy,

14:39.128 --> 14:41.255
and I'm afraid it would
endanger the experiment.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.631
It won't though.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.049
Jason, it already has.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.219
So, why don't we just take a break
until it's all finished?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.851
Also, I hate to pile on, but I feel
like you have a right to know.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.565
The Jacksonville Jaguars
cut Blake Bortles.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.569
He's not on the team anymore.
I am genuinely sorry.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.369
Hi, how are you?

15:12.453 --> 15:14.121
Nice to see you. Enjoy your yogurt.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.207
Problem is, now he's saddled
with a bad motivation.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.626
His points won't go up

15:18.709 --> 15:21.128
if the only reason he's being nice
is to make his points go up.

15:21.211 --> 15:24.882
Yeah. But that was also my situation
when I first asked Chidi for help.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.343
I only did it so you wouldn't catch me.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.761
We have to hope that over time,

15:28.844 --> 15:31.013
Brent starts doing good things
out of habit.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.141
Just like you.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.771
Hey, I just realized something.

15:38.854 --> 15:42.942
That whole "You're the only one
who can save us" speech.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.362
You didn't actually have
a nervous breakdown on day one, did you?

15:46.445 --> 15:49.406
You faked it,
so that I would step up and take over.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.954
-Guilty.
-You tricky devil. Very clever.

15:55.537 --> 15:59.833
All right. Time to go help
Simone and Chidi.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.837
Oof! Why did I come up with this idea?
This is gonna hurt real bad.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.839
I know. I know.
But I think it's gonna work.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.467
Yeah, but it's gonna suck for me.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.428
You sure there's no other
girl from Arizona who can do this?

16:11.512 --> 16:14.765
What about Emma Stone?
She's from there. She's very capable.

16:14.848 --> 16:18.268
Remember her in <i>Zombieland?</i>
And <i>La La Land?</i>

16:18.352 --> 16:20.229
What's with all her movies
ending with "land"?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.106
-You're stalling.
-Yup. Heading out.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.068
Oh, Jason, I'm so sorry.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.404
Janet was my whole afterlife.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.073
How am I gonna get over her?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.951
I used to have a breakup routine
when a relationship ended.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.079
Champagne and Alanis Morissette.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.330
Not the actual singer.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.750
I just listened to her albums
at my friend Adele's house.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.337
I guess I could do
my normal breakup routine.

16:45.421 --> 16:48.882
Drink a ton of Mountain Dew, steal an ATV

16:48.966 --> 16:50.801
and ride it through a Panda Express.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.179
But then I'd have to ask Janet
for the Mountain Dew and the ATV,

16:54.263 --> 16:57.307
and then I'd have to see Janet,
and then I'd start crying.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.394
-What do I do?
-I honestly don't know.

17:00.477 --> 17:04.481
But whatever you do,
you'll be doing it with your friends.

17:08.777 --> 17:12.156
And I didn't even get to tell you
about the Blake Bortles part.

17:12.239 --> 17:17.995
So, Chidi, do you remember that woman
Simone from the party the other night?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.705
Simone...

17:19.788 --> 17:22.374
the Third Eye Blind superfan

17:22.458 --> 17:24.501
who walked around
cutting off people's ponytails?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.045
That's the one.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.131
Uh, I need your help,
acclimating her to the neighborhood.

17:29.214 --> 17:33.802
I've tried, but since she thinks
this whole thing is imaginary,

17:33.886 --> 17:37.306
and I'm an authority figure,
I'm extra suspicious.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.808
Well, what makes you think
I'd have any more luck?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.395
Chidi, you and Simone...

17:45.272 --> 17:46.607
are soulmates.

17:48.567 --> 17:52.237
Soulmates? Like our souls are...

17:53.155 --> 17:54.198
are...

17:54.281 --> 17:55.491
Mates, yes.

17:55.574 --> 17:59.203
Everyone has people
that they're cosmically bound to,

17:59.286 --> 18:01.955
and the system brings them together
in the afterlife.

18:02.039 --> 18:07.544
And I can say, with complete certainty,
that you and Simone are two such people.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.965
I haven't told her yet.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.176
I wouldn't have told you, ordinarily,

18:14.259 --> 18:16.595
but since she's gone
a little cuckoo bananas...

18:17.638 --> 18:19.014
That's the official architect term.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.476
Uh, I thought it was prudent
to let you know.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.895
Whoo, boy, uh...

18:24.978 --> 18:26.105
I'm getting a stomachache.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.984
But a good one! A happy stomachache!
This is new.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.612
There are some great writings

18:33.695 --> 18:37.366
on simulated realities
that might help her adjust.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.992
Descartes, Moravec, Zhuang Zhou...

18:39.076 --> 18:40.702
I wonder if I can summon a book
from my apartment.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.165
Well, good luck.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.918
This is incredible.

18:48.001 --> 18:52.506
I spent my whole life in pursuit
of fundamental truths about the universe,

18:52.589 --> 18:56.385
but I never actually
fell in love with someone.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.345
I know.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.683
Oh, right. Of course.
You know everything about me.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.685
I do indeed.

19:11.733 --> 19:15.612
Hi, Simone.
Uh, Chidi. From the other night.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.865
Oh! Wow.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.159
My brain must
really like keeping you around.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.703
Have a fake seat
and grab a yogurt that doesn't exist.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.163
Right, um...

19:24.246 --> 19:30.294
So, if I understand your state of mind,
it's basically solipsism.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.005
You think that you're
the only real thing in the universe,

19:33.088 --> 19:36.592
and everything else
stems from your consciousness.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.596
Yes, but to be fair, I only think that
because it's true and I'm right.

19:40.679 --> 19:46.560
No offense, but solipsism,
as a philosophy, is pretty juvenile,

19:46.643 --> 19:49.771
especially for a person
with multiple advanced degrees.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.316
And it's also impossible to refute,

19:52.399 --> 19:56.028
because everything you see
is confirmed by your belief.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.487
However...

19:58.197 --> 20:01.491
- Dude!
-What? If none of this is real,

20:01.575 --> 20:03.619
then it really shouldn't matter, right?
In fact...

20:04.661 --> 20:06.955
- Dude!
-What?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.875
It's not real. None of this matters.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.002
Leave that on your nose
for the rest of time.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.630
Fine. Point sort of taken.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.839
You know, in a larger sense,

20:15.923 --> 20:18.133
if you go around acting like
no one else matters,

20:18.217 --> 20:20.677
then you end up doing things
like knocking over cakes,

20:20.761 --> 20:25.057
and pushing people into pools
and just generally acting like a jerk.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.727
Why not treat them better,
just in case they're real?

20:28.810 --> 20:30.229
I mean, what do you have to lose

20:30.312 --> 20:33.273
by treating people
with kindness and respect?

20:33.357 --> 20:38.403
Okay. Keep talking, probably-fake
but-maybe-real philosopher man.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.994
<i>Well, good news,</i>
<i>Simone and Chidi are hitting it off.</i>

20:46.578 --> 20:48.914
I mean, I wasn't getting
any use out of him as a boyfriend,

20:48.997 --> 20:51.208
so why not pass him off
to someone in need?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.378
Is this what donating
old bras to Goodwill feels like?

20:54.461 --> 20:57.089
It must have been really hard,
lying to Chidi like that.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.383
That's the thing,
I don't know that it was a lie.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.468
They did fall in love on Earth.

21:01.551 --> 21:02.761
And Michael was right.

21:02.844 --> 21:06.723
Chidi made a huge sacrifice for us,
and I had to make sure it was worth it.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.227
It's arguable that you made
an even bigger sacrifice.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.105
You actually have to live
with this situation.

21:13.188 --> 21:17.067
Chidi just gets to go around,
blissfully unaware of what he gave up.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.944
Yeah, but we know what he gave up.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.780
Dat ash.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.285
Come on, bud. I know you're down,
but you can't leave me hanging.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.829
You're right. That is the code.
