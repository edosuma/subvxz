00:01.067 --> 00:02.944
Previously on Grimm...

00:05.605 --> 00:06.743
What have you done?

00:06.873 --> 00:08.682
I don't have any powers.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.222
You've taken everything.

00:12.612 --> 00:13.784
Farley Kolt.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.485
Put the coins on the bed. No.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.994
You'll never find them again.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.861
What the hell?

00:52.185 --> 00:53.596
He's not himself.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.155
He's been acting weird.

00:55.221 --> 00:59.795
I'm just, you know,
worried about him after what he saw.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.400
Has he said anything?

01:01.461 --> 01:04.236
No, but I can tell there's
something not right.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.701
Hank's got to be shook up
about this in some way.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.978
You know, I mean whether
he's talking about it or not,

01:11.504 --> 01:14.781
when I saw him looking up at me,
he was freaked.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.059
And it's a look I've seen before,
let me tell you.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.616
I'm sure you're hoping
it will just go away

01:22.682 --> 01:23.717
and he won't say anything,
but look.

01:23.783 --> 01:26.354
This is not, like,
your ordinary nightmare, okay?

01:26.419 --> 01:28.296
He knows he was awake.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.000
And his brain is trying to
process the un-processable.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.128
I mean, what did you think
when you first saw one Woge?

01:38.264 --> 01:40.369
I thought I was going crazy.
Right, well...

01:40.433 --> 01:42.538
Hank's probably going through
the same thing, you know?

01:42.602 --> 01:44.513
You know, with you,
it was one thing.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.518
He was hit. He was knocked out.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.451
He was a little dazed.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.086
But, I mean,
he saw Brinkerhoff change.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.954
That is so not going
to make it any easier.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.660
Trust me, mental hospitals
are chock-full of people

02:02.722 --> 02:04.724
who have spent their lives
trying to wrap their minds

02:04.791 --> 02:06.828
around things they've
seen and can't explain.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.231
Great.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.137
But hey, look, with Hank,
maybe it'll be different, you know?

02:10.196 --> 02:12.836
He's a cop. He's already
seen a bunch of crazy stuff.

02:12.899 --> 02:16.506
With any luck, it'll wear off
in a couple, three years.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.475
MAN ON PHONE: Hello.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.314
I found your friend.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.748
Marquesa.

02:55.808 --> 02:59.449
It's time for you to get
on a plane to Portland.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.725
Thanks.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.457
You don't look like
you slept too well.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.796
I didn't.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.561
What's going on?

03:12.625 --> 03:15.162
The usual suspects,
tossing and turning.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.498
Must have been something I ate.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.243
What did you get from Interpol?

03:19.499 --> 03:21.308
File on Akira Kimura.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.209
Oh, yeah.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.776
One of the guys responsible
for killing your parents.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.112
It's a great way to start your day.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.347
And get this, they tied
him to the beating death

03:30.443 --> 03:32.013
of a coin collector in Hamburg.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.887
Turns out the victim
was the dealer who sold

03:33.947 --> 03:35.949
the three gold coins to Sam
Bertram here in Portland.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.319
I'm not sad those
coins disappeared.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.830
You know, that's a
nasty-looking guy.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.968
What the hell is that
thing on his face?

03:44.023 --> 03:45.832
It's called the Aegishjalmur.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.200
And that means what?

03:47.260 --> 03:48.432
"Helm of Awe."

03:48.494 --> 03:51.498
It's a symbol the Vikings
wore for invincibility.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.975
You know what?

03:53.032 --> 03:54.807
I'm going to trust my flak jacket.

03:55.468 --> 03:58.415
We got our last known
whereabouts on Mr. Invincible?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.052
Lisbon. Fourteen months ago.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.822
Welcome to the
Portland Governor, sir.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.295
Where's Marquesa?

04:19.559 --> 04:21.300
I found a lot more than him.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.537
I've got something
very special for you.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.180
Why don't you come on out
and see your new home?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.618
That's a good girl.

05:12.545 --> 05:14.388
Marquesa was tied to a
jewelry store robbery

05:14.447 --> 05:16.791
here in Portland
two-and-a-half months ago.

05:16.849 --> 05:20.626
The owner, Sam Bertram,
was killed during the robbery.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.900
Now after that, Marquesa
killed a police officer,

05:24.991 --> 05:27.665
gained access to the
precinct using his uniform

05:27.727 --> 05:30.003
in an attempt to get
at a police captain.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.601
That's where I became intrigued.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.669
I couldn't figure out why Marquesa
went after a police captain

05:35.735 --> 05:37.146
after he pulled off a heist.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.545
So I did a little more
digging on your behalf,

05:42.175 --> 05:44.177
and that's when I found out...

05:46.045 --> 05:47.922
There were three
gold coins discovered

05:47.980 --> 05:50.119
in that jeweler's stomach
the night he was killed.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.959
Now I got all this from
the coroner's report.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.259
How did you get this report?

05:56.856 --> 05:59.894
'Cause ex New York City cops
generally get what they want,

06:00.259 --> 06:02.739
which brings me to my next subject.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.906
These are the two detectives
that handled the case

06:06.966 --> 06:08.502
And killed Marquesa.

06:09.402 --> 06:13.873
This is Captain Renard,
the guy Marquesa went after.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.076
This guy?

06:15.141 --> 06:16.950
I don't know how he
figures into everything.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.080
He's a local guy. Repairs clocks.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.753
I believe he's a police informant.

06:21.814 --> 06:24.021
And I think one of these men

06:24.083 --> 06:26.893
either has the coins or
knows where they are.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.832
Our deal was for me
to find Marquesa.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.596
Well, I did that.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.665
These coins, however, present a
whole new business opportunity.

06:36.662 --> 06:39.700
So you want to be my partner?

06:41.434 --> 06:44.574
This is the guy
Marquesa went after.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.316
That's him coming out of his condo.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.785
I got names and addresses
on all of them.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.154
You need me.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.792
Not anymore.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.091
Hey, wait a minute!

07:31.651 --> 07:33.153
So, Mr. Adams,

07:33.753 --> 07:36.757
you must have found something
that wasn't good for you.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.532
Adalind?

07:42.595 --> 07:44.302
Hi, Juliette.
I'm glad you remember me.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.899
Of course I remember you.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.070
Well, I just wasn't
sure if I should come by

07:48.134 --> 07:50.205
since things didn't work
out with Hank, you know.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.577
Oh, stop.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.981
I don't take my patients based
on their owners' social lives.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.247
I'm glad you came in,
and I'm glad you brought your cat.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.687
Well, I am relieved to hear that

07:58.744 --> 08:00.746
because Majique seems
to be pretty sick.

08:00.813 --> 08:04.192
Oh, no. What seems to be the
problem with Miss Majique?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.729
She's just not herself.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.061
She's sluggish. She won't eat.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.995
I'm pretty worried.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.126
Do you think it's serious?

08:12.191 --> 08:13.727
Well, I hope not,
but I'm probably going to want

08:13.793 --> 08:16.171
to keep her overnight
to run some tests.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.211
Oh, you seem to have the touch.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.571
Majique! Ow!

08:22.635 --> 08:24.171
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

08:24.237 --> 08:25.807
Yeah, it's an occupational hazard.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.215
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

08:27.807 --> 08:30.549
She's a good kitty,
aren't you, Majique?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.018
Hey.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.192
Where's the body?

08:40.253 --> 08:41.664
First floor, room at the back.

08:41.721 --> 08:42.791
It's a little messy.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.027
Well, what do we know?

08:44.123 --> 08:45.466
Uh, male, mid-40s.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.835
Looks like somebody took a
weed whacker to this throat.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.306
Checked in three weeks ago
under the name Nathaniel Adams.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.569
Clerk says he kept to himself,

08:51.631 --> 08:54.305
paid his rent, listed his
home as New York City.

08:55.668 --> 08:56.908
There was no sign of forced entry.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.846
Maid discovered the
body about an hour ago.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.441
You weren't kidding
about the weed whacker.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.076
Looks more like a hatchet.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.677
Except his head's still here.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.381
Who rolled the body? Nobody.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.946
That's the way the maid
said she found him.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.356
Well, this body's been rolled.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.121
The pattern on the carpet
matches the blood on his shirt.

09:10.182 --> 09:11.525
That could have been the killer.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.963
There's no wallet, nothing in
his pockets. Maybe a robbery.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.762
There's nothing in the
room except for a coat

09:16.822 --> 09:19.098
Got it. hanging behind
the bathroom door.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.336
There's a key here.
Looks like a rental.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.983
There we go.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.045
Hey, we got some
equipment back here.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.815
Cameras, lenses, monopod.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.994
Let's see what he was
taking pictures of.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.440
Download's done.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.512
Let's see what this
guy was shooting.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.211
I hope it's not
something too gross.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.787
What the hell?
Why's this guy watching us?

10:15.014 --> 10:17.085
I don't know. Better find out.

10:17.149 --> 10:19.789
All right, we better tell
the Captain. I'll call him.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.431
Might be a good idea to put
some uniforms at our houses.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.491
Got it. I'll send one
to the Captain's.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.363
Oh, no. Patty.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.309
Where are the coins?

11:50.676 --> 11:53.247
Where are the coins?

11:55.214 --> 11:56.989
Where are the coins?

12:00.286 --> 12:01.822
Where are they?

12:09.061 --> 12:10.472
Who are you?

12:13.032 --> 12:14.511
I'm the one who asks the questions.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.138
Where are the coins?

12:18.804 --> 12:20.477
I don't have them.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.946
They were taken from me.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.848
Give me his name.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.424
Farley Kolt.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.231
Kolt does not have them.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.992
I found him in Los Angeles.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.161
I wasted three days finding
out he didn't have them.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.832
I don't plan to waste
that much time with you.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.938
Look, I told you,

12:45.998 --> 12:47.841
I don't have the coins.

12:58.344 --> 13:02.087
Where are the coins?

13:15.995 --> 13:18.566
Captain? Sergeant Wu.

13:19.431 --> 13:22.469
Detective Griffin wanted me
to come over and check on you.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.247
Captain?

13:32.311 --> 13:34.848
If you can hear me,
please open the door.

13:36.615 --> 13:37.855
Captain?

13:39.118 --> 13:40.426
Listen, I'm not sure he's home.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.624
I'm going to get the
key from the super.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.030
Stay here.

14:12.718 --> 14:13.719
Hey.

14:13.819 --> 14:14.889
You locate the Captain?

14:14.954 --> 14:17.195
No. Not yet. Knocked
on his door, no answer.

14:17.256 --> 14:19.429
Checked his car.
It was in his parking space.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.030
Just got the key to his condo
from the building super.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.596
Let's do this.

14:31.337 --> 14:32.680
He's down!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.180
Radio for backup.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.213
I'm going to need
backup and an ambulance

14:40.279 --> 14:41.280
at the Captain's residence.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.436
He's alive.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.572
His housekeeper's not.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.300
He wanted the coins that
were stolen from the jeweler.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.040
I told him Farley Kolt had them.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.240
And he said he found
Kolt in Los Angeles,

15:38.304 --> 15:40.341
spent three days with him,
and was sure he didn't.

15:41.173 --> 15:44.882
You might want to check with LAPD
if Kolt's body has been found.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.255
I doubt he left him alive.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.419
And if he didn't wind up
with the coins, who did?

15:50.916 --> 15:53.453
Maybe he got rid of them before
this guy caught up with him.

15:53.519 --> 15:54.554
I don't think this guy thought so.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.963
That's why he's here in Portland.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.068
He had photos of all of us.
Me, Nick, and you, Captain.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.165
They were taken by a private
investigator from New York.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.571
His body was found this
morning at a downtown hotel.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.142
And we found a camera in
the trunk of a rental car.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.236
Downloaded the photos.
That's why we came after you.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.644
That's lucky for me.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.444
He had no intention
of leaving me alive.

16:12.504 --> 16:14.711
You get a good look at him? Yeah.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.579
Asian, mid-40s,

16:18.844 --> 16:21.154
he had a tattoo on
the side of his head.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.189
Sounds like the picture of
the guy out of New York.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.192
What picture? Akira Kimura.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.728
Who is he?

16:27.786 --> 16:29.823
Yeah. That's the same guy.

16:30.556 --> 16:31.591
Akira Kimura.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.228
He was somehow connected to
my case on Roth and Flynn.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.902
The guys who came
for the coins. Yeah.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.634
God knows those coins
aren't healthy to be around.

16:38.697 --> 16:39.835
And we did a little more digging,

16:39.898 --> 16:41.605
found out Kimura is tied to

16:41.667 --> 16:44.113
a secret organization
called the Dragon's Tongue.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.979
It was founded in 1901,
connected to the Japanese Imperial Army.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.280
It went underground after the
Japanese defeat in World War ll.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.677
But it appears the
organization has resurfaced

16:51.744 --> 16:52.882
with ties to the Yakuza.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.618
We got a report that
Kimura was identified

16:54.680 --> 16:57.320
by state police in Hamburg,
Germany, three months ago.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.623
Now he's here.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.055
I want you to tear this town apart
and find this son of a bitch.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.137
We think he hired a private
investigator out of New York.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.507
We found photos of you.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.239
And me, Hank, the Captain,

17:14.299 --> 17:15.835
everybody on this
investigator's camera.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.445
The same investigator
we found dead today.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.478
We think Kimura killed him.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.484
Why would he kill the guy he hired?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.452
Remember those coins I
was telling you about?

17:24.510 --> 17:26.751
Oh, yeah. Everybody died?

17:27.846 --> 17:29.484
Why would this guy
come after me, man?

17:29.548 --> 17:31.118
I've never even seen the coins.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.163
He probably won't,
but we don't know that for sure.

17:35.687 --> 17:38.600
Now all three guys involved
in the jewelry store robbery

17:38.657 --> 17:40.659
were also involved in the
killing of my parents.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.901
I just found out Kimura
was tied to them.

17:42.961 --> 17:45.532
He might be the last link I
have to find out why my parents

17:45.597 --> 17:46.803
were killed and who killed them.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.708
Okay. I got it.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.279
He's super dangerous, and you want
to catch this piece of garbage alive.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.520
I want him alone,
and not in an interrogation room.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.344
So you want a little Grimm time?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.514
Yeah.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.153
I could probably
help you with that.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.923
I think I found just what you need.

18:12.157 --> 18:17.766
Says here this Grimm captured this
Siegbarste with his trusty crossbow

18:18.130 --> 18:20.474
and an arrow filled
with Schlaftrunk,

18:20.532 --> 18:23.035
which is basically
a sleeping toxin.

18:23.869 --> 18:27.544
He was able to subdue the big
fella with one shot to the neck.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.155
And they were able
to keep him alive?

18:32.578 --> 18:35.058
Uh, yeah. Just long enough
to draw and quarter him,

18:35.714 --> 18:37.284
which is actually not
as easy as it seems.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.226
You need a lot of ropes and chains

18:39.284 --> 18:40.957
and, like,
a minimum of four horses,

18:41.019 --> 18:42.623
but all you need is
some Schlaftrunk.

18:43.522 --> 18:46.093
Let's hope your aunt has some.

18:46.358 --> 18:47.564
Got it.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.268
How much do we need?
There's not much left.

18:52.898 --> 18:56.311
Um, they don't really
say in the book.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.639
Here.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.210
Well...

19:01.673 --> 19:03.084
If you're supposed
to use an eyedropper,

19:03.142 --> 19:05.850
I'd say a little
probably goes a long way.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.680
It better.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.808
Thanks for looking out.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.008
Juliette? I'm upstairs.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.376
Coming down.

19:35.874 --> 19:37.217
Hey. Hey.

19:40.579 --> 19:41.683
I don't really feel like cooking.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.590
Do you? No.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.220
Where do you want to go?
I was hoping that you would ask.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.162
I made a reservation
at Laurelhurst Market.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.762
One at 9:00 in your name

19:50.822 --> 19:53.268
and one at 10:00 in my name
just in case, you know.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.861
Just in case what? I don't know.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.100
Things have been going pretty
well lately. Knock on wood.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.800
Uh-huh. Keep going.

19:59.298 --> 20:03.007
Well, you've been around a little bit more.
A little bit more attentive.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.376
Mmm.And?

20:04.436 --> 20:05.437
Ooh.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.514
What bit you today? Not a bite.
It's just a scratch.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.517
From a...

20:11.977 --> 20:13.513
Dog? Uh-uh.

20:13.579 --> 20:14.580
Cat? Uh-uh.

20:14.646 --> 20:15.750
Bird? Uh-uh.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.020
Wolf? Mmm.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.028
Guinea pig, sidewinder, what?

20:19.117 --> 20:20.494
Just a cat.

20:20.619 --> 20:21.825
Just a cat?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.332
You never talk about
your patients that way.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.560
What, did you have to put one down?

20:24.790 --> 20:27.168
No. I wasn't going to tell you.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.996
Tell me what? You promise
you won't get mad?

20:29.428 --> 20:31.237
About a cat? Why would
I get mad about a cat?

20:32.364 --> 20:33.672
It was Adalind's cat,

20:33.732 --> 20:35.439
and I know that you don't like her,
and she knows that, too.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.945
She didn't even
want me to tell you.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.738
Let me see that.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.215
Nick, what's the matter with you?

20:40.272 --> 20:41.751
Take it easy.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.613
How long ago did this happen?

20:43.675 --> 20:45.313
Today, just before lunch.

20:45.377 --> 20:46.788
Baby, I get scratches all the time.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.825
Not like this you don't.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.562
You don't understand.
Yeah, I don't understand.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.358
You're getting all
worked up about nothing.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.999
You don't know her like I do. Okay?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.391
You know, you said that once before.
What does that mean?

20:59.458 --> 21:01.404
Okay, we need to get you
to a doctor right now

21:01.460 --> 21:02.461
and get that thing checked out.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.098
I'm not going to a
doctor for a cat scratch.

21:05.297 --> 21:06.537
Listen, your life
could be in danger.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.271
That's ridiculous.

21:08.634 --> 21:09.840
Juliette. I'm tired of this.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.574
You don't understand what she is.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.116
What? What is she, Nick?

21:13.171 --> 21:14.878
She's an attractive,
successful woman.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.010
You saved her life once.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.145
I don't know what it is
you have against her now.

21:19.645 --> 21:20.749
What is it that
you're not telling me?

21:20.812 --> 21:22.257
Do you have some kind of
relationship with her?

21:22.314 --> 21:23.554
No. Then what is it?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.424
She's a witch, okay?

21:25.751 --> 21:27.059
You're going to need to
try a little harder, Nick.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.154
What? Does she ride a broom?

21:28.220 --> 21:30.598
Because I distinctly remember
her getting into a BMW.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.066
You don't know what's
going on here, Juliette.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.497
Then isn't it about
time you tell me?

21:34.559 --> 21:35.765
You're going to the doctor.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.135
I told you,
I'm not going to a doctor

21:37.195 --> 21:39.436
till you tell me why
you're acting so crazy.

21:56.682 --> 21:57.786
Okay.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.157
You want the truth?

22:01.353 --> 22:03.560
Yeah, the truth would be nice.

22:04.356 --> 22:05.858
Get your coat.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.870
I told you,
I'm not going to a doctor.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.567
I know.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.539
You want the truth,
you're going to get it.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.929
All right, I guess I
should have figured

22:34.986 --> 22:36.624
this would have something
to do with Aunt Marie.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.032
Nick, I've been inside
your aunt's trailer.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.503
I've seen all the
crazy stuff in there.

22:41.593 --> 22:42.936
I don't know what you
expect to show me

22:42.994 --> 22:45.031
that I haven't already seen.
Juliette, please.

22:46.665 --> 22:50.374
Look, if you want to understand why

22:51.370 --> 22:52.872
I was attacked in our house...

22:54.339 --> 22:55.409
Run!

22:56.575 --> 23:01.217
If you want to understand why my
aunt was attacked on the street...

23:05.550 --> 23:08.724
And if you want to know why you
were kidnapped by that crazy woman.

23:09.287 --> 23:10.459
Time for you to scream.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.864
Time for you to scream.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.705
You're just going to have
to trust me on this one.

23:22.033 --> 23:23.137
Okay.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.749
How often do you come here?

23:35.814 --> 23:38.954
Whenever I have a problem
I can't figure out.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.498
What kinds of problems
would lead you here?

23:45.457 --> 23:47.095
Something started happening to me

23:48.360 --> 23:50.567
around the time my aunt died.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.040
I guess it was destined to happen.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.372
I just didn't know about it yet.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.944
I started seeing things
I couldn't explain,

23:57.235 --> 23:59.476
and I thought I was going crazy.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.707
But before she died, she told me

24:02.774 --> 24:04.082
that some of my other relatives

24:04.142 --> 24:08.215
have this same problem, ability...

24:08.480 --> 24:09.618
Whatever you want to call it.

24:10.982 --> 24:14.486
This trailer is filled with
things you can't believe.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.835
It's the history of
my ancestors who were,

24:18.890 --> 24:22.235
now stay with me,
sort of like hunters.

24:24.329 --> 24:25.603
What did they hunt?

24:26.932 --> 24:29.037
See, this is where it gets a
little difficult to explain.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.745
Yeah, you're going to have to try.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.975
I know. I know.

24:34.005 --> 24:35.382
Okay, this is going to
sound a little weird,

24:35.440 --> 24:37.681
and I know it's going to
sound a little weird, okay?

24:42.848 --> 24:44.191
Here goes.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.329
I can see things that...

24:49.921 --> 24:50.991
That what?

24:52.090 --> 24:53.160
That most people can't.

24:54.759 --> 24:56.329
You mean, like, ghosts?

24:56.461 --> 24:58.202
No. No. Not the dead.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.370
Well, that's good.

25:00.765 --> 25:03.245
Look, apparently my
ancestors from Germany,

25:03.301 --> 25:04.905
the Grimms, who I guess
I'm related to on

25:04.970 --> 25:07.917
my mother's side of the family,
had the same ability.

25:08.139 --> 25:09.914
What kind of ability
are we talking about?

25:10.008 --> 25:11.043
See these books?

25:12.410 --> 25:16.051
They're filled with drawings
made by my ancestors

25:16.114 --> 25:18.526
and some other people who
had the same ability.

25:19.417 --> 25:23.263
And the drawings are of Wesen,

25:24.589 --> 25:26.068
which is how they like
to refer to themselves.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.697
Who, the Grimms?

25:27.759 --> 25:28.829
No, the Wesen.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.228
And that's what I can see.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.634
What the Grimms could see.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.176
And there are all kinds of them.

25:39.271 --> 25:43.276
They're kind of like species
that exist within us.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.286
Some of us.

25:46.144 --> 25:49.853
Anyway, there's Blutbad
and Bauerschwein,

25:50.081 --> 25:51.890
Fuchsbau, Eisbibers.

25:52.417 --> 25:53.919
Remember that fire dancer Ariel?

25:54.185 --> 25:55.391
Yeah. She was a Daemonfeuer.

25:55.587 --> 25:56.759
A dragon thing.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.032
And they're all in
these books. Look.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.465
Lowen are a kind of lion.

26:03.929 --> 26:05.135
Look at the picture here.

26:05.797 --> 26:07.470
Juliette, I mean,
I'm not making this up.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.671
I mean these Lowen were
running an illegal fight ring

26:09.734 --> 26:11.941
that dates back to the
time of the gladiators.

26:12.437 --> 26:16.010
They were fighting with these.
Ancient weapons.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.722
This is a morning star.

26:23.248 --> 26:27.196
There's a rifle in here that shoots

26:27.252 --> 26:29.732
special bullets to
kill Siegbarstes.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.291
But first, you have to dip
them in this stuff here.

26:32.991 --> 26:35.335
This stuff right here.
Siegbarste Gift.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.274
"Gift" means "poison" in German.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.976
The point is, I can see these Wesen

26:41.032 --> 26:43.012
in what you would see as a
perfectly normal person.

26:43.301 --> 26:45.474
When they go through
something called the Woge,

26:45.537 --> 26:47.016
which is kind of like
this emotional surge,

26:47.072 --> 26:48.244
that's when I can see them.

26:49.874 --> 26:51.410
I know how this must sound,

26:51.476 --> 26:53.353
but I swear to God, it's all true.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.388
Look, you want to see
who Adalind really is?

27:01.019 --> 27:03.863
This is what Adalind really is,
a Hexenbiest.

27:05.724 --> 27:08.295
Juliette, you got to
read some of this stuff.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.198
I mean, the stuff's
that's in English,

27:10.261 --> 27:11.296
because most of it's in German.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.304
And there's actually some of it in French,
Spanish, and even Latin.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.914
Oh, there's some of it in Japanese.

27:19.004 --> 27:21.678
They all look like stories
you'd read in a book,

27:21.740 --> 27:24.311
but they're not. They're real.

27:24.743 --> 27:28.748
There are things in this
trailer that you can't believe.

27:28.847 --> 27:29.951
Uh...

27:31.983 --> 27:33.394
Cameras

27:33.451 --> 27:35.658
and film of Hitler

27:35.720 --> 27:38.667
and the Verrat shooting
people in 1936.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.828
The Verrat worked with
the seven royal families,

27:40.892 --> 27:42.872
which I'm just beginning
to learn about.

27:44.129 --> 27:46.735
Juliette, I can't tell you
how it all fits together.

27:47.732 --> 27:49.609
Even my parents were
killed because of this.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.215
My aunt was a Grimm
all these years.

27:53.271 --> 27:54.375
I didn't even know it. Look.

27:54.439 --> 27:57.909
I can show you film right
here that will blow your mind.

28:01.946 --> 28:03.289
Juliette!

28:04.616 --> 28:07.187
I know how this sounds.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.625
This is why my aunt told
me I shouldn't be with you.

28:09.988 --> 28:12.434
You need to talk to somebody,
Nick, but it's not me.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.197
Juliette, I'm trying to explain.

28:14.559 --> 28:15.731
Okay.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.502
Okay, remember that hair you found
on the horse when it was attacked?

28:18.563 --> 28:20.167
You couldn't figure
out what it was.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.403
That is what I'm talking about.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.912
You need professional help!
No, Juliette.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.376
Look, yes, I understand
why you're saying that.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.719
There's one more thing I
can do to prove to you...

28:33.778 --> 28:36.884
Nick, please. Stop,
okay! You're really scaring me!

28:36.948 --> 28:39.656
I don't want to scare you I
just want you to know the truth.

28:42.854 --> 28:44.959
Come with me. Just give
me this one last chance.

28:53.431 --> 28:54.910
Hey, Nick, Juliette.

28:54.966 --> 28:56.411
What a pleasant surprise!

28:58.470 --> 28:59.847
I think.

29:01.339 --> 29:02.716
Come on in.

29:07.712 --> 29:12.320
So, um, can I get
anybody a drink or...

29:12.817 --> 29:14.319
Okay, you need to tell her.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.226
Um, tell her...

29:17.522 --> 29:19.433
About you, about me,
about everything.

29:19.624 --> 29:22.662
You know, I'm really sorry.
I have no idea what he expects you to do.

29:22.727 --> 29:24.400
Monroe, you need to show
her what a Blutbad is.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.339
Okay, I... You want
to explain to me

29:26.397 --> 29:29.310
how we suddenly arrived
at this crucial crux

29:29.367 --> 29:31.711
kind of a zenith pinnacle moment?

29:31.803 --> 29:33.476
Juliette got scratched by a cat.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.607
Um, well, that's too bad,

29:35.673 --> 29:37.311
but I'm not sure how
that qualifies...

29:37.375 --> 29:40.015
The cat belongs to Adalind. Oh.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.691
That's actually not so good.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.055
And I took her to the trailer.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.391
Adalind? No, Juliette.
I showed her everything,

29:46.484 --> 29:48.054
I told her everything.

29:51.689 --> 29:53.498
She thinks I'm crazy.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.938
Okay.

29:56.327 --> 29:59.433
So we're just kind of

29:59.497 --> 30:02.637
jumping out of the old airplane
without a parachute here, huh?

30:02.700 --> 30:04.737
Monroe, you're my last chance.
You have to do this.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.646
Nick. Enough.

30:07.005 --> 30:09.007
Juliette, I don't care if
you believe me anymore.

30:09.073 --> 30:11.815
I'm just worried about you.
You're worried about me?

30:11.876 --> 30:14.356
You don't understand what
Adalind is capable of.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.391
I'm going home. This is ridiculous.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.957
Okay, okay. Just give me
a second to get into it.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.688
Juliette, wait, wait.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.195
Okay, Juliette,

30:25.256 --> 30:27.202
Monroe is going to show
you something right now.

30:27.859 --> 30:29.896
Nick. Just wait.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.466
Now, Juliette, remember,
what you're about to see

30:34.666 --> 30:36.043
is just me.

30:39.103 --> 30:40.548
Juliette?

30:41.139 --> 30:44.609
Oh, God. What happened?

30:44.976 --> 30:47.252
What did I do? l warned her.

30:47.312 --> 30:48.723
I told you what would happen if...

30:48.847 --> 30:50.520
Look, this doesn't have
anything to do with you.

30:53.284 --> 30:54.854
We have to get her to a hospital.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.267
Oh, dude.

31:30.622 --> 31:34.126
We're canvassing the area hoping to
find someone who's seen the suspect.

31:35.526 --> 31:37.403
Yeah, I've seen him. When?

31:38.029 --> 31:40.771
Checked in this morning.
Paid for three days, cash.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.003
What room is he in?

32:01.519 --> 32:03.192
Ma'am? Hey.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.029
Hey, stay where you are.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.562
Robinson, stop her!

32:10.461 --> 32:12.236
Ma'am, stop now.

32:12.463 --> 32:14.033
Hold up.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.045
What else did she tell you
about this cat? Anything?

32:57.108 --> 32:59.588
Just that Adalind brought it in,
and it scratched her.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.054
And she wouldn't believe
anything I said about Adalind.

33:03.114 --> 33:04.286
That's why I brought
her to the trailer.

33:04.349 --> 33:05.692
That's why I brought her to you.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.058
Okay, I get it.

33:07.118 --> 33:10.224
But I got to tell you, it was a little
on the short side for a warning.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.435
When did she get scratched? Today.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.270
Look, Nick, I know you're hoping

33:15.326 --> 33:17.397
the doctors are going to be able
to do something for her, but

33:18.262 --> 33:19.866
you saw what happened to Hank,

33:19.931 --> 33:21.535
you saw what happened
to your sergeant.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.343
We got to get our hands
on that cat, man.

33:25.069 --> 33:26.514
Detective Burkhardt? Yeah?

33:26.571 --> 33:27.641
We have her stabilized.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.378
If this is an infectious disease,

33:29.440 --> 33:31.010
she'll need to stay quarantined.

33:31.275 --> 33:33.084
Normally, cat scratches
are not that dangerous,

33:33.144 --> 33:34.919
so there may be something
else going on here.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.118
The tests are going to
take quite a while to run.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.888
There's nothing more
you can do right now.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.657
I suggest you go home.

33:40.718 --> 33:42.720
As soon as we know something,
we'll call you.

33:45.790 --> 33:46.962
Look, Nick,

33:47.025 --> 33:49.232
I know you want to stay
here and be with Juliette.

33:49.293 --> 33:50.397
I do.

33:51.829 --> 33:55.174
But that's not going to help her.
Let's find that cat.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.576
All right.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.409
Yeah. Nick.

33:59.737 --> 34:02.149
Sergeant Wu got a hit on
Kimura at the Palms Motel.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.550
But when they went to check on the room,
they were attacked.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.822
Are they okay? For the most part.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.085
But it wasn't Kimura.
It was a woman.

34:09.514 --> 34:12.188
And we're thinking he's working with
a woman who's not to be messed with.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.563
So watch yourself. You, too, Hank.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.965
We keep the cats on this side.

34:22.126 --> 34:23.696
If we kept them with
the dogs and the birds,

34:23.761 --> 34:25.706
they'd be screeching and
hollering all night.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.172
Okay, how do we know which
is the cat we're looking for?

34:28.331 --> 34:30.471
Well, the name of the
owner is on every cage.

34:30.534 --> 34:31.741
Do you know the name of the owner?

34:31.803 --> 34:33.873
Yeah, Schade. Adalind Schade.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.212
Okay.

34:43.181 --> 34:46.094
Oh, hello, Majique.

34:46.684 --> 34:48.630
You don't look very sick to me.

34:51.289 --> 34:53.132
Yep, that's probably the one.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.440
How's it going?
Everything all right?

35:03.501 --> 35:05.037
Yeah, there's nothing
happening out here.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.582
All right. See you in the morning.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.576
All right, stand back. Stand back.

35:11.742 --> 35:14.052
Don't get too close.
We got to knock this thing out.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.924
If you don't have any
drugs that'll do it,

35:15.980 --> 35:17.857
a 2x4 would be fine by me.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.622
How's Juliette? We don't know yet.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.491
I'm so sorry, Nick.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.091
You think you can
figure out what this is?

35:24.856 --> 35:25.960
I'm going to do my best.

35:26.023 --> 35:27.331
First, I have to
test the cat's claws,

35:27.391 --> 35:29.837
but if I can't get it from the cat,
I'm going to have to see Juliette.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.133
Okay. Are you good here for now?

35:31.195 --> 35:32.799
Not really. Yes.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.310
Hey, where you going?
I'm going to find Adalind.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.159
Maybe it just doesn't like me.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.720
Blutbaden and house
pets don't really mix.

35:53.784 --> 35:56.526
Except, you know, as the
occasional between-meal treat.

35:56.854 --> 35:59.630
I'm going to start with
some Valeriana officinalis.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.542
All right.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.449
No, no, no. Don't shoot.

37:59.343 --> 38:00.686
Hey, come on. Put it down.

38:04.715 --> 38:06.251
Who were you shooting at?

38:10.454 --> 38:11.762
Adalind!

38:26.737 --> 38:27.841
Adalind!

38:33.044 --> 38:35.388
Yeah? He was here
at my house, Nick.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.652
Tore it apart.
All right, I'm on my way home.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.358
If he hit your place,
he's probably going to hit mine.

38:40.418 --> 38:41.488
Is Juliette home?

38:41.552 --> 38:43.828
No. Well, don't let her go home.

38:43.921 --> 38:45.764
She's in the hospital.
What? What happened?

38:45.823 --> 38:47.564
Is she okay? I don't know yet.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.695
But I can meet you at your place.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.172
No, you stay.
You take care of yours.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.640
All right. Then call for backup.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.874
Don't worry. I will.

39:09.747 --> 39:11.784
You sure this is going
to knock that feline out?

39:12.183 --> 39:15.130
It won't knock it out, it will
paralyze it for about 30 minutes.

39:15.519 --> 39:18.557
That should give us enough to
check its claws and saliva.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.264
Okay, lift the cover.

41:00.491 --> 41:03.301
You are the Grimm.
You have the coins.

41:03.994 --> 41:05.974
Give them to me.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.135
I'll give you this!

41:11.769 --> 41:13.578
You killed my parents!

41:17.975 --> 41:19.579
Why did you kill them?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.545
Find what you were looking for?

42:26.544 --> 42:27.648
Nick.

42:28.479 --> 42:30.982
Nicky, it's me.

42:33.317 --> 42:34.523
Mom?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
