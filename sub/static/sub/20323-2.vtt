Ooh, are those
cinnamon nuts?

11:23.450 --> 11:26.918
Mmm Yes! I got them
from the cart outside.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.754
They're delicious.
Do you want some?

table? Magical map on it?

cutie marks shoot out?

11:33.827 --> 11:36.061

11:36.063 --> 11:39.330
Why in Equestria would
something like that be in here?

11:39.332 --> 11:43.802
Well, I cast a pretty amazing
spell that transported it

11:43.804 --> 11:46.071
to the last place
I was thinking of.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.406
But I might have been thinking
about how I'd treat myself

11:48.408 --> 11:51.309
to a nice brooch instead.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.012
Ah. Well, no huge table here.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.114
Are you still interested
in that brooch?

11:56.116 --> 11:56.948
Sure!

11:56.950 --> 11:58.116
No!

11:59.318 --> 12:01.086

time for this!

are gonna be back soon.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.226

What's our next stop?

12:14.334 --> 12:17.502
It's really really
important that we find it.

12:17.504 --> 12:22.874
And it might be here because
somepony was craving apples.

12:22.876 --> 12:27.312
I'm still craving them. They'd
go so well with cinnamon nuts!

12:27.314 --> 12:30.982

do smell good!

have sworn it'd be

because it was warm

12:52.506 --> 12:54.506

thought I wanted ice cream.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.374

out the Crystal Empire

12:56.376 --> 12:58.309

is made out of crystals

12:58.311 --> 13:00.078

crystals on my mind.

13:02.414 --> 13:05.049
OK. We'd better start moving
