00:02.085 --> 00:04.747
If we're talking anaerobic
exercises, different story,

00:05.047 --> 00:06.913
because you're using
your own body weight,

00:07.216 --> 00:09.628
an efficient form
of strength training.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.134
What's happening?
Dave is joining my gym,

00:12.429 --> 00:14.170
so I'm gonna become
his new fitness guru.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.134
No, he's not,
but I am gonna get ripped.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.299
Deal with it.
I'm confident we can.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.808
You go to the gym?
Mm-hmm.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.639
An exercise gym?
Oh, yeah.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.397
| love the gym.
The steam room, the smoothies,

00:24.691 --> 00:26.523
the free 2-in-1
shampoo and conditioner.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.525
Haven't heard you
mention working out.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.232
I'm a gym rat. I live there.
But do you exercise there?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.398
Know what else I love?
Wearing gym clothes.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.816
People see you,
they feel bad about themselves.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.110
Did they hit the gym today? No.
Did I? Yeah.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.448
But what did you do there?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.955
Also pretty great?
Gym shoes.

00:42.251 --> 00:45.664
Shoot me a text on how this
shakes out. I have a ton to do

00:45.963 --> 00:48.705
to get ready for my meeting
with the homeowners association,

00:49.007 --> 00:50.873
of which I am...
ALL: Two-term president.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.837
The vote of which was...
Unanimous.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.719
We're building a roof garden,
and I have to do everything.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.597
But with the HOA, it just makes
more sense to give one person

00:58.892 --> 01:01.304
complete power to suppress
opposition and criticism.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.640
| think you said
the definition of fascism.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.601
Nothing new. Jane has always
been president of everything.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.642
Student body, National Honor
Society, our immediate family.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.481
It's true.
I'm secretary of state.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.363
So only four people have to die
for me to become president.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.070
Jane running the building
means I'm first gentleman.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.827
People stand a little taller
when I get in the elevator,

01:20.122 --> 01:21.783
and Mr. Olsen
gives me a ham every month

01:22.082 --> 01:23.447
to maintain
his parking spot.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.366
Ugh. Politics.
Get ready, America.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.706
There are two black men
in office up in here.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.588

than two black men in office.

Whoa.
Dial back the rage, Dave.

making it to the gym today.

taking care of yourself, okay?

Josh Brolin from The Goonies?

02:12.049 --> 02:14.586

Oh, no, no, no. He's paying me.

cut your face off. I hate you."

Dudes trying to impress girls.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.069

all the time.

03:25.831 --> 03:26.195

I'm gonna learn to play golf.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.078
That's a dumb idea.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.035
God,
the pill's making me crazy.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.372
A couple of us had some other
ideas about the rooftop garden.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.083
I'm pretty sure I covered
everything with my poster,

04:17.382 --> 04:18.247
but go ahead.
We thought it might be nice

04:19.301 --> 04:21.838
to have elderflowers because
they grow these berries.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.469
Ooh, berries.
Nice, right?

04:24.765 --> 04:29.054
Huh. Michael,
that could be a good idea.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.889
Except for when those berries
attract pigeons and rats,

04:32.189 --> 04:33.475
and they poop everywhere.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.391
It just takes one person
inhaling a little poop dust,

04:36.693 --> 04:38.684
and we've got a full-on
hantavirus outbreak.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.193
But in that one week

04:40.489 --> 04:42.321
before we're all immobilized
by disease,

04:42.616 --> 04:44.482
we could enjoy
some really nice berries.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.776
Ooh, berries.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.739
| guess I hadn't
thought this through.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.621
Yeah,
| guess you hadn't.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.203
Why don't you focus less
on killer berries

04:53.502 --> 04:56.961
and more on parking your Maxima
inside the lines in the garage?

04:57.255 --> 04:59.212
I'm so sorry.
No, don't be.

04:59.508 --> 05:03.001
We-- We all do things.
All right.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.383
His idea was terrible.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.389
Haven't you ever heard
the expression,

05:09.684 --> 05:11.140
"You catch more flies
with honey"?

05:11.436 --> 05:13.723
You catch more with a fly strip,
with its combination

05:14.022 --> 05:15.729
of pheromones
and a chemical adhesive.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.766
Far and away your best bet.
You seem really stressed.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.309
Okay,
how about the next time,

05:20.612 --> 05:23.479
before you lose it on someone,
you sleep on it.

05:23.782 --> 05:24.988
See what happens.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.274
Everything's much clearer
the next morning.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.612
I'd lose all my steam.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.448
No way
| can stay fired up that long.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.580
That's the point. Remember when
| was gonna file that complaint

05:33.875 --> 05:36.333
against my neighbor's cockatoo,
but then I slept on it.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.619
The next day,
| bought that bird a Clementine,

05:38.922 --> 05:41.664

Problem solved.

Not my jam.

go re-park my car?

05:48.473 --> 05:50.931

in a good way, like,

05:51.226 --> 05:53.843
"Hey, bitch.
Your hair is glowing, okay?

05:54.145 --> 05:55.931

that deep condition?

05:56.231 --> 05:57.892
No, but who cares
what that guy thinks.

the machines. Such a jerk.
