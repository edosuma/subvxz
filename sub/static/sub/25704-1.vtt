Strike team
bolo bolo, gun trucks

00:51.663 --> 00:52.796

00:54.566 --> 00:55.866
Copy that.

00:55.868 --> 00:58.735
Target location is
north side of the plaza.

00:58.737 --> 01:00.870
No one reach out at
this time, SOB obliged.

01:00.872 --> 01:03.472
Do not engage,
repeat, do not engage.

01:03.474 --> 01:04.674
Dawson.

01:04.676 --> 01:07.043
Let me know when you
have eyes on the asset.

01:07.045 --> 01:08.711
Copy that.

01:08.713 --> 01:12.115
He's in the mosque.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.532
Now Dawson's
playing this chick

02:03.534 --> 02:06.802
and she hits every
fuckin' ball in the hole,

02:06.804 --> 02:08.406
including the eight.

02:09.975 --> 02:11.941
Takes all his fuckin' money.

02:14.779 --> 02:17.213
Come on Dawson, tell
me you let her win.

02:17.215 --> 02:18.648
And then some.

02:18.650 --> 02:20.549
What can I say, brother?

02:20.551 --> 02:22.520
I'm a sucker for
green-eyed blondes.

02:23.554 --> 02:25.823
I can't wait to get out
of this fucking shithole.

02:26.925 --> 02:29.226
First round's on Dawson.

02:29.228 --> 02:32.095
First and
second round's on Dawson.

02:32.097 --> 02:33.230
Okay eyes on, boys.

02:33.232 --> 02:34.166
Humvee's here.

02:35.334 --> 02:38.234
Copy that, I got
eyes on the vehicle.

02:38.236 --> 02:39.103
Copy.

02:41.706 --> 02:44.173
This guy's a terrorist
and he gets a free pass?

02:44.175 --> 02:46.108
This is political bullshit.

02:46.110 --> 02:49.612
Five years ago we would have
taken this motherfucker out.

02:49.614 --> 02:52.915
I hear you brother, but
today him and his family

02:52.917 --> 02:54.917
have been promised
a safe passage.

02:54.919 --> 02:56.253
This asshole has a lot of intel

02:56.255 --> 02:59.022
and this SOB thinks it's
worth something so remember,

02:59.024 --> 03:01.724
we're here to provide
support only, guys, come on.

03:01.726 --> 03:03.793
Frank, keep a close
eye on the perimeter.

03:03.795 --> 03:04.796
Copy that.

03:11.269 --> 03:13.069
Guys, we've got a problem.

03:13.071 --> 03:14.737
My position's been compromised.

03:14.739 --> 03:15.771
I repeat, my posi...

03:20.145 --> 03:21.744
Dawson.

03:21.746 --> 03:23.180
Dawson, god damnit!

03:23.182 --> 03:25.613
Frank, do not break position.

03:25.615 --> 03:28.252
I repeat, do not break position.

05:50.561 --> 05:52.163
- My name is Phillip.
- Hi Phillip.

05:54.031 --> 05:57.832
You know, the
hardest part of this whole thing

05:57.834 --> 06:00.670
is knowing that I'm
doing it to myself.

06:02.173 --> 06:04.809
I ended up having a stroke,
going to the hospital.

06:05.943 --> 06:07.211
And I still couldn't stop.

06:09.347 --> 06:11.115
It was going good
for a while too.

06:12.816 --> 06:15.384
Until I lost somebody
very close to me.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.390
She was there and
now she's gone.

06:21.225 --> 06:22.859
Like she never even existed.

06:26.497 --> 06:28.931
Anyway, that's
all I got, thanks.

06:28.933 --> 06:29.965
- Thank you Phillip.
- Thank you Phillip.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.201
Thank you Phillip.

06:32.203 --> 06:33.738
Does anyone else wanna share?

06:37.575 --> 06:38.442
Frank.

06:39.343 --> 06:41.544
You've been here for a while.

06:41.546 --> 06:43.811
Do you feel like sharing
anything with the group?

07:03.867 --> 07:04.734
Oh shit.

07:09.540 --> 07:10.408
Sorry, ese.

07:35.966 --> 07:36.833
Alright, kid.

07:38.502 --> 07:40.271
We'll replace the
headers tomorrow.

07:41.872 --> 07:43.274
Sure, whatever you say Frank.

07:50.481 --> 07:52.514
Good work week.

07:52.516 --> 07:53.384
Thanks, Frank.

07:54.884 --> 07:57.553
Sure you don't wanna come
inside, have a little dinner?

07:57.555 --> 07:59.421
I would but I got that date.

07:59.423 --> 08:01.490
Oh yeah.

08:01.492 --> 08:02.759
Get the fuck outta here.

08:22.045 --> 08:23.011
Like a volcano.

08:23.013 --> 08:24.448
I know, Mom.

08:40.496 --> 08:42.866
I gotta make a delivery
to the hills tomorrow.

08:44.234 --> 08:45.235
We'll ride pickup.

08:48.572 --> 08:50.239
I'm gonna bring Pedro.

08:50.241 --> 08:51.108
What?

08:52.276 --> 08:54.844
And leave us stuck
here on a Saturday?

08:57.481 --> 09:00.383
Besides, Shannon and I like
to drive the truck, don't we?

09:01.251 --> 09:04.354
Please Frank, please?

09:05.955 --> 09:10.960
How could I say no to that?

09:25.975 --> 09:26.976
You happy, right?

09:29.112 --> 09:30.146
You know I am.

09:31.481 --> 09:32.482
Good, me too.

09:41.124 --> 09:42.126
Good answer.

09:49.265 --> 09:51.568
My man.

10:27.036 --> 10:28.370
Bye baby.

10:28.372 --> 10:30.239
Little young, ain't she?

10:30.241 --> 10:31.807
No such thing.

10:31.809 --> 10:32.909
You lost?

10:33.811 --> 10:35.179
What the fuck you doing here?

10:36.613 --> 10:37.580
Delivery.

10:38.681 --> 10:39.747
Oh.

10:39.749 --> 10:41.182
You're the grease monkey.

10:41.184 --> 10:42.452
I'll show you where to go.

10:43.586 --> 10:44.454
I know the way.

11:01.504 --> 11:03.573
Nels, I got this.

11:05.608 --> 11:07.143
Let's go, let's take a walk.

11:09.646 --> 11:11.514
Fuckin' grease monkey.

11:12.850 --> 11:14.217
Been a
long time, Frank.

11:16.152 --> 11:17.084
Looking good, Laz.

11:17.086 --> 11:17.954
Yeah?

11:19.088 --> 11:20.491
Well, some new shit.

11:21.358 --> 11:23.291
Bitch I'm shacking
with saw it on Oprah.

11:23.293 --> 11:24.325
Oprah.

11:24.327 --> 11:26.260
Hey, I know what
you're thinking.

11:26.262 --> 11:28.262
Shut your fucking mouth.

11:28.264 --> 11:30.631
So this is how you spend
your retirement, man?

11:30.633 --> 11:31.532
Better than golf.

11:31.534 --> 11:33.701
Anything's better than golf.

11:33.703 --> 11:36.103
How much they pay you
for one of these things?

11:36.105 --> 11:36.772
Enough.

11:36.774 --> 11:37.840
Yeah?

11:37.842 --> 11:39.073
Not like
it used to be.

11:39.075 --> 11:40.441
Nothing's
like it used to be, man.

11:40.443 --> 11:43.279
Come on, let's have a drink.
Boss wants to see you.

11:48.785 --> 11:50.518
- Sure.
- So what is it, my brother?

11:50.520 --> 11:51.819
You still drinking
that vodka or what?

11:51.821 --> 11:53.521
Ah no man I'm good.

11:53.523 --> 11:55.756
Just give me some
soda water's fine.

11:55.758 --> 11:56.724
So what, what's the deal?

11:56.726 --> 11:58.125
You on the wagon?

11:58.127 --> 11:59.095
Nah, I'm driving.

12:05.803 --> 12:06.670
Tell you what.

12:09.138 --> 12:10.006
For real.

12:11.374 --> 12:13.407
Here's to the golden
years, my man,

12:13.409 --> 12:16.644
assuming we live long
enough to fuckin' see 'em.

12:16.646 --> 12:18.212
I know I will.

12:21.919 --> 12:25.553
Oh yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

12:25.555 --> 12:26.422
Come on.

12:33.764 --> 12:35.295
Hey boss.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.164
Frank's here.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.333
Hey, I gotta get back to it.

12:39.335 --> 12:40.234
Good to see you, man.

12:40.236 --> 12:41.569
Likewise.

12:41.571 --> 12:42.436
Mi amigo, Frank.

12:42.438 --> 12:44.305
How's my car?

12:44.307 --> 12:46.541
Oh, a cherry
and like a virgin.

12:47.777 --> 12:50.046
Fucking Frank, always
a perfectionist, huh.

12:51.681 --> 12:53.015
So what do you think?

12:53.017 --> 12:55.784
Oh I think that Nikki'll
be crying her eyes out

12:55.786 --> 12:58.319
- in disappointment.
- You know what I say?

12:58.321 --> 13:00.253
If you can't spoil
'em what's the point?

13:00.255 --> 13:01.789
Papa, Papa!

13:03.893 --> 13:05.226
Sorry Leonard.

13:05.228 --> 13:07.862
I told her you have guests
but she didn't listen.

13:07.864 --> 13:10.498
She never listens.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.767
Tell Mama you I
don't have to listen,

13:12.769 --> 13:14.502
it's my birthday!

13:20.010 --> 13:21.745
Now what can I do for my little?

13:22.746 --> 13:25.113
Papa can I please ride
my new bike, please?

13:27.951 --> 13:28.818
Well.

13:30.486 --> 13:31.821
Let me see.

13:33.690 --> 13:38.759
If you promise not to take
it out of the driveway.

13:38.761 --> 13:39.627
I promise.

13:39.629 --> 13:40.595
Pinky promise?

13:40.597 --> 13:41.662
- Pinky promise.
- Pinky promise.

13:41.664 --> 13:44.735
Thank you
Papa, thank you.

13:48.437 --> 13:50.172
Let's go, careful.

13:52.274 --> 13:53.141
Nels.

13:54.310 --> 13:55.778
Go watch her, make
sure she's alright.

13:56.913 --> 13:58.113
What the fuck?

13:59.716 --> 14:01.517
Why I always gotta
be the errand boy?

14:06.023 --> 14:09.323
Because you are the
fucking errand boy,

14:09.325 --> 14:12.260
and if you ever talk like
that in front of Nikki again,

14:12.929 --> 14:15.665
I'll have Lazarus
slice your tongue out.

14:18.968 --> 14:20.735
Yeah yeah, sorry.

14:20.737 --> 14:21.738
Wait up, Nikki.

14:32.415 --> 14:35.049
My little.

14:35.051 --> 14:38.586
I can't refuse her, I had to
give her at least one present.

14:38.588 --> 14:39.454
Of course.

14:40.523 --> 14:41.989
You're a lucky man, Len.

14:41.991 --> 14:44.892
Hey it's not too late for
you to join the club, homes.

14:45.962 --> 14:48.295
I can fix you up
with Lupe's cousin.

14:48.297 --> 14:50.798
She's not much to look
at but aye she's got

14:50.800 --> 14:53.434
some beautiful chi chis.

14:53.436 --> 14:54.635
I ain't never seen 'em.

14:54.637 --> 14:56.038
Hmm.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.473
Just know they're there.

14:58.574 --> 15:00.875
She'll make a man
outta you, homes.

15:00.877 --> 15:02.244
I'm a leg and ass man.

15:02.979 --> 15:03.846
Ah.

15:04.981 --> 15:06.783
Let's go take care
of some business.

15:10.453 --> 15:11.320
Yes sir.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.370
Jesus Christ Len,
it's just one car.

15:29.572 --> 15:31.639
Yeah, it's a very special car.

15:31.641 --> 15:34.374
And like I said,
what's the point

15:34.376 --> 15:36.610
if you can't spoil 'em a little?

15:36.612 --> 15:37.914
Yeah well I ain't your kid

15:38.848 --> 15:40.817
and it definitely
ain't my birthday.

15:41.918 --> 15:42.785
You got me.

15:44.887 --> 15:48.688
Thought maybe you'd be
getting a little bored

15:48.690 --> 15:53.495
with being retired, thought
maybe you'd like some real work.

15:54.897 --> 15:57.900
Well, what I do is real work.

15:59.702 --> 16:02.970
I'm done with that other
shit, Len, you know that.

16:04.474 --> 16:05.475
But thank you.

16:13.415 --> 16:14.282
Keep it.

16:15.383 --> 16:16.518
You earned it.

16:34.437 --> 16:35.771
Ready Nikki, ready?

16:46.082 --> 16:47.181
That's right, bitch.

16:47.183 --> 16:48.050
Walk away.

16:51.087 --> 16:53.422
Hey Nels, I've got
two words for you.

16:55.191 --> 16:56.058
The Silencer.

16:57.593 --> 16:58.661
That piece of shit?

17:00.062 --> 17:00.960
I'll tell you what?

17:00.962 --> 17:02.129
Why don't you go fuck with him

17:02.131 --> 17:04.430
and I guarantee they'll
find pieces of you

17:04.432 --> 17:06.566
hanging in someone's
refrigerator.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.435
Come on.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.443
Be right back, huh?

17:16.512 --> 17:17.780
Sorry.

17:42.805 --> 17:44.839
Do not break position.

17:52.514 --> 17:54.814
Do not break position.

18:57.713 --> 19:01.716
Who in the fuck is
calling this late at night?

19:19.969 --> 19:20.836
Hello?

19:24.072 --> 19:24.940
Hello?

19:26.708 --> 19:28.209
Frank, is that you?

21:03.638 --> 21:05.271
The daughter
of Leonard Ochoa,

21:05.273 --> 21:07.073
a prominent Mexican businessman

21:07.075 --> 21:09.942
and long-suspected member
of the Sinaloa cartel

21:09.944 --> 21:12.678
was killed today in
a tragic accident.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.814
The unidentified male
driver of the vehicle

21:14.816 --> 21:16.983
fled the scene after
allegedly hitting the girl

21:16.985 --> 21:19.086
as she rode her
bike near her home.

21:19.088 --> 21:21.221
As of this afternoon, the
driver is still being sought

21:21.223 --> 21:22.289
by law enforcement.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.090
The girl's father,
Leonard Ochoa,

21:25.226 --> 21:26.325
has previously been charged

21:26.327 --> 21:27.960
with a host of
offenses including...

21:27.962 --> 21:29.328
Frank, what is it?

21:29.330 --> 21:30.496
Transportation
of illegal immigrants,

21:30.498 --> 21:31.564
drug trafficking,
prostitution and murder,

21:31.566 --> 21:33.366
though he has never
been convicted.

21:33.368 --> 21:34.501
Nothing.

21:34.503 --> 21:35.335
We'll
bring you updates

21:35.337 --> 21:37.236
on this developing story.

21:38.474 --> 21:39.839
Holidays are upon us
and while New Mexicans

21:39.841 --> 21:43.410
across the state each
celebrate in their own way,

21:43.412 --> 21:46.447
perhaps the award for most
out of this world tradition

21:46.449 --> 21:48.582
oughta go to, no
surprise, Roswell.

22:02.163 --> 22:03.365
Frank, what's going on?

22:05.733 --> 22:06.601
Go back inside.

22:14.409 --> 22:16.311
Keeping tabs on me now?

22:17.879 --> 22:19.347
I'm just doing my job, Frank.

22:20.748 --> 22:22.183
You heard about Nikki?

22:23.818 --> 22:24.953
Saw it on the news.

22:26.888 --> 22:27.620
How's Len doing?

22:27.622 --> 22:28.756
How do you think?

22:32.093 --> 22:33.862
He wants this guy gone, Frank.

22:36.931 --> 22:39.999
If it doesn't consist of
me fixing an automobile,

22:40.001 --> 22:41.136
I'm not interested.

22:44.472 --> 22:49.041
Right now, he just
doesn't give a shit

22:49.043 --> 22:50.278
what you're interested in.

22:55.183 --> 22:57.186
10 o'clock tonight.

23:07.428 --> 23:08.296
Look Frank.

23:09.464 --> 23:11.132
You know I got your back, right?

23:20.175 --> 23:21.042
Yeah.

23:22.311 --> 23:23.911
Ever since Folsom.

23:26.813 --> 23:28.950
Folsom was a long time ago.

23:31.519 --> 23:32.954
And I'm just a worker bee.

23:35.323 --> 23:36.357
You know what I mean?

24:07.523 --> 24:11.122
Shannon Elizabeth Wilson,
put your decorations away

24:11.124 --> 24:12.090
and get ready for bed.

24:12.092 --> 24:13.292
But I was just gonna...

24:13.294 --> 24:14.993
I didn't ask what
you were just gonna,

24:14.995 --> 24:17.096
just do as you're told.

24:17.098 --> 24:18.899
Mom, stop yelling at me.

24:20.535 --> 24:22.935
Santa won't come
if you don't listen.

24:22.937 --> 24:23.805
Okay.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.275
And don't forget to brush.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.580
So you gonna tell me
what that was all about?

24:33.582 --> 24:35.416
And don't fucking
lie to me, Frank.

24:38.653 --> 24:40.051
Look, you have
nothing to worry about.

24:40.053 --> 24:44.023
It's just old business, it
has nothing to do with us.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.890
It has everything
to do with us Frank

24:45.892 --> 24:47.528
because it has something
to do with you.

24:48.563 --> 24:50.164
And we said no secrets.

24:57.539 --> 25:01.842
Mommy, can Frank
come tuck me in?

25:03.244 --> 25:04.144
Okay sweetie.

25:05.580 --> 25:06.813
I'll be right back.

25:10.084 --> 25:11.085
Motherfucker.

25:17.158 --> 25:20.828
Get you tucked in or we
both get in trouble, okay?

25:25.466 --> 25:26.900
I got something for you.

25:27.702 --> 25:29.136
What, you did?

25:30.438 --> 25:33.004
My mommy gave me this
when I was really little.

25:33.006 --> 25:34.575
Right after my real daddy left.

25:35.443 --> 25:38.146
She said it was because I
was like a piece of her,

25:39.147 --> 25:42.114
but now you're kind of
like a piece of us both

25:42.116 --> 25:43.051
so it's for you.

25:52.627 --> 25:54.092
Wow.

25:54.094 --> 25:57.231
That's the nicest gift anyone's
ever given to me, Shannon.

26:00.501 --> 26:01.336
Thank you.

26:05.206 --> 26:07.373
Goodnight, Frank.

26:07.375 --> 26:08.242
I love you.

26:09.645 --> 26:11.378
Goodnight Shannon.

26:12.580 --> 26:13.980
I love you too.

26:29.397 --> 26:30.498
She gave me a present.

26:35.402 --> 26:36.470
Well she loves you.

26:39.741 --> 26:40.608
Yeah.

26:49.082 --> 26:50.016
I gotta go.

26:50.718 --> 26:51.586
Frank.

26:53.421 --> 26:54.322
Please don't go.

26:57.558 --> 26:58.925
Not that simple, Cass.

26:59.626 --> 27:01.328
It is that simple, Frank.

27:02.295 --> 27:04.231
You just don't go,
you stay right here.

27:07.468 --> 27:08.335
Sorry.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.018
Think I was gonna hit you?

27:26.186 --> 27:27.053
Why not?

27:28.589 --> 27:29.489
Everyone else has.

27:33.528 --> 27:35.596
I'm not everybody else.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.100
You wanna go, Frank?

27:41.102 --> 27:43.502
Go, get out of here.

27:43.504 --> 27:45.471
Get out of here.

27:45.473 --> 27:47.340
Why don't you just go?

27:49.643 --> 27:50.709
Leave!

28:49.704 --> 28:52.105
I heard about Nikki, Len.

28:53.541 --> 28:54.408
I'm so sorry.

28:55.810 --> 28:56.677
How's Lupe?

28:57.678 --> 28:58.545
Lupe?

29:00.580 --> 29:02.282
She's how you say, uh...

29:05.685 --> 29:07.153
not tracking too well.

29:10.691 --> 29:13.528
Thinking about sending her
down to our place in Mexico.

29:14.896 --> 29:16.397
She got family there.

29:19.667 --> 29:21.700
Maybe she can rest.

29:21.702 --> 29:23.770
Maybe you should go
down there too, Len.

29:26.506 --> 29:27.607
Get some rest.

29:28.508 --> 29:29.376
Yeah, maybe.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.346
I ever take you there, Frank?

29:35.582 --> 29:36.784
No Len, you never did.

29:37.852 --> 29:39.552
Too bad.

29:39.554 --> 29:42.557
I been going ever
since I was a kid.

29:44.825 --> 29:50.564
This one time, oh,
I was maybe 10.

29:52.265 --> 29:53.333
Nikki's age.

29:56.336 --> 29:59.606
We were on our way back from TJ.

30:00.741 --> 30:03.578
I had to ask the old
man to pull over.

30:06.279 --> 30:09.280
Got out of the car,
went behind a bush

30:09.282 --> 30:13.618
to take care of some business
and he just drove off

30:13.620 --> 30:14.919
and left me.

30:14.921 --> 30:17.422
It took me an hour to find him.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.257
It was 100 degrees outside.

30:19.259 --> 30:20.760
I almost died.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.632
My old man, he just looked at me

30:28.435 --> 30:33.441
and said, "Lenny, don't
ever trust anybody

30:36.343 --> 30:37.444
"if you wanna survive."

30:45.852 --> 30:47.320
I'm not my old man, Frank.

30:53.828 --> 30:56.797
I told her not to ride
that bike in the street!

30:59.799 --> 31:01.501
She's a kid, Len.

31:04.304 --> 31:06.437
Always gotta keep your eyes
on 'em, they're everywhere,

31:06.439 --> 31:07.674
they run around.

31:09.676 --> 31:10.810
It was an accident.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.714
I'm saying you gotta let it go.

31:15.716 --> 31:18.017
No, no it was no accident.

31:18.019 --> 31:19.285
This was murder!

31:20.521 --> 31:23.521
And I'm gonna get the
guy who killed her.

31:23.523 --> 31:25.425
Oh, I wanna...

31:27.027 --> 31:30.430
I want his wife to cry
like my Lupita is crying.

31:32.632 --> 31:35.835
I wanna dance at his funeral
and piss on his grave!

31:38.304 --> 31:39.172
Yeah.

31:41.474 --> 31:42.442
I understand.

31:44.645 --> 31:45.713
Have Laz do it.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.513
He's good.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.682
Yeah, yeah he does good work

31:50.684 --> 31:52.316
if I wanna level the city.

31:52.318 --> 31:55.255
No, this calls for a surgeon.

31:58.324 --> 32:01.795
This calls for The Silencer.

32:03.064 --> 32:04.664
I need you, Frank.

32:08.635 --> 32:11.771
I wish I could help
you Len, I really do.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.340
But I've retired.

32:25.752 --> 32:29.754
Lazarus tells me that
this new lady of yours

32:29.756 --> 32:30.891
is quite a woman.

32:32.659 --> 32:36.395
Got a little girl,
what's her name, Sharon?

32:37.997 --> 32:39.130
Shannon.

32:39.132 --> 32:40.433
Oh yeah, Shannon.

32:42.368 --> 32:46.037
Now what do you think
little Shannon would do

32:46.039 --> 32:49.907
if she knew
everything about you?

32:49.909 --> 32:53.377
Because if I don't
get what I want,

32:53.379 --> 32:58.350
I will tell little
Shannon and her mommy

32:59.518 --> 33:02.387
all about you, everything.

33:07.060 --> 33:07.927
Alright, Len.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.897
Since you put it that way.

33:12.932 --> 33:13.800
I'll do it.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.004
Under one condition.

33:18.438 --> 33:19.938
This is it.

33:19.940 --> 33:21.975
This is my last job.

33:24.144 --> 33:25.377
You understand me?

33:26.913 --> 33:28.313
Do you?

33:34.521 --> 33:35.388
Deal.

33:39.692 --> 33:41.528
Can't escape who you are, Frank.

33:45.765 --> 33:46.900
None of us can.

34:32.679 --> 34:33.911
Guy's name is Anderson.

34:35.347 --> 34:38.614
He and the wife got a place
few hours outside of town.

34:38.617 --> 34:39.886
Bastard turned himself in.

34:40.820 --> 34:43.020
Sheriff's due to
pick him up tonight,

34:43.022 --> 34:45.656
won't be more than like
maybe two, three guys.

34:45.658 --> 34:47.592
This just keeps
getting fuckin' better.

34:47.594 --> 34:49.760
Frank, relax man.

34:49.762 --> 34:51.097
Len just wants Anderson.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.099
Piece of cake, man.

34:55.768 --> 34:57.870
It's never a piece
of cake with you, Laz.

36:46.678 --> 36:47.746
Motherfucker.

37:18.311 --> 37:20.146
And
we said no secrets.

37:57.216 --> 37:58.750
Frank didn't take the shot.

37:59.452 --> 38:02.219
Deputies are taking
Anderson right now.

38:02.221 --> 38:03.854
Told you he wouldn't do it.

38:03.856 --> 38:04.756
Didn't I tell ya?

38:08.261 --> 38:10.896
Why don't you just shut
your fucking mouth, cabron?

38:18.271 --> 38:19.137
Kill him.

38:53.772 --> 38:55.406
10-4, we're
in route to the station.

38:55.408 --> 38:57.276
Suspect is in custody.

39:08.253 --> 39:09.320
Get down!

39:44.390 --> 39:47.257
She closed her eyes and
as she drifted off to sleep

39:47.259 --> 39:51.062
she smiled as she dreamed
about her next adventure.

39:56.334 --> 39:59.269
Can we read
another story, Mama?

39:59.271 --> 40:00.439
Not tonight, baby.

42:06.131 --> 42:06.998
Frank?

42:57.981 --> 42:59.649
Where's Frank?

42:59.651 --> 43:00.882
I don't know.

43:00.884 --> 43:03.118
Bitch I said where
the fuck is Frank at?

43:03.120 --> 43:04.389
He's not here.

43:07.559 --> 43:08.460
I can see that.

43:10.562 --> 43:12.061
I guess you're gonna
help me find him then.

43:15.735 --> 43:17.400
Get over here, bitch.

43:37.722 --> 43:38.590
Yeah, yeah okay.

43:45.262 --> 43:46.562
Fuck!

43:59.110 --> 44:01.778
Laz, what about the kid?

44:54.199 --> 44:56.232
Come on Cass.

44:56.234 --> 44:57.101
Cass.

44:58.435 --> 44:59.570
What the fuck?

45:00.705 --> 45:02.370
Motherfuckers.

45:52.289 --> 45:53.457
Just kidding.

46:08.908 --> 46:13.243
No!

46:14.545 --> 46:17.615
Death kinda puts things
in perspective, doesn't it?

46:18.750 --> 46:20.382
Has for me.

46:20.384 --> 46:21.784
Don't do!

46:21.786 --> 46:23.388
Ready, one, two.

46:41.639 --> 46:43.639
Yes I can see about faxing
that prescription over

46:43.641 --> 46:46.644
so we can expedite that
procedure immediately.

46:47.679 --> 46:49.345
Absolutely.

46:49.347 --> 46:50.213
Thank you.

46:52.250 --> 46:54.819
You're sure you didn't
see anything, Mr. Harris?

46:56.287 --> 46:57.154
No.

46:59.256 --> 47:00.123
Well.

47:01.625 --> 47:03.493
Think of something,
here's my number.

47:11.301 --> 47:12.835
Frank.

47:12.837 --> 47:13.703
Tim.

47:13.705 --> 47:14.706
How is she?

47:19.844 --> 47:22.677
Doc says through and through.

47:22.679 --> 47:23.647
She's lucky, man.

47:25.649 --> 47:27.816
Could have been worse,
hit a major artery.

47:35.392 --> 47:36.393
Cass.

47:42.467 --> 47:43.701
How's the kid doing, dude?

47:48.805 --> 47:51.608
Can you give us
a minute alone?

48:13.697 --> 48:15.399
I told you the day that we met

48:18.735 --> 48:20.437
that I already divorced one liar

48:22.040 --> 48:23.607
and to not waste my time.

48:24.976 --> 48:26.176
And what do you do?

48:29.413 --> 48:32.850
The past two years you've
done nothing but lie to me

48:34.484 --> 48:35.184
about everything.

48:36.753 --> 48:38.588
Who you are, what you are.

48:40.624 --> 48:41.558
Everything.

48:42.859 --> 48:44.526
Not everything.

48:44.528 --> 48:46.728
Then tell me why
we're here, Frank.

48:46.730 --> 48:47.865
Can you tell me that?

48:52.937 --> 48:53.871
What about Shannon?

48:54.839 --> 48:55.707
Cass.

48:57.074 --> 48:58.408
I promise you.

48:59.943 --> 49:01.745
I will get her back.

49:37.048 --> 49:38.415
I'll be right back.

49:47.424 --> 49:48.123
Hi.

49:48.125 --> 49:49.357
Good day, ma'am.

49:49.359 --> 49:51.960
Can I get two
cheeseburgers, no tomatoes,

49:51.962 --> 49:53.997
and two french fries?

49:59.402 --> 50:00.769
Better make that two coffees.

50:00.771 --> 50:01.937
Can I get that to go please?

50:01.939 --> 50:02.807
Sure.

50:06.677 --> 50:07.779
Thank you ma'am.

50:16.920 --> 50:17.752
Here you go, sugar.

50:17.754 --> 50:18.655
Oh great.

50:19.623 --> 50:20.490
Thank you ma'am.

50:21.825 --> 50:22.557
Keep the change.

50:22.559 --> 50:23.227
Thank you so much.

50:23.326 --> 50:24.594
Have a great day.

50:40.443 --> 50:41.311
Shit.

51:15.512 --> 51:17.012
What the fuck are you doing?

51:17.014 --> 51:17.915
Drinking.

51:20.717 --> 51:22.384
This shit'll fuck you up, man.

51:23.619 --> 51:26.486
That's the same shit
fucked you up in the corps.

51:26.488 --> 51:27.356
Better pay.

51:28.758 --> 51:29.926
But it costs the same.

51:31.161 --> 51:32.028
Not no more.

51:33.297 --> 51:34.963
This is why I don't
fuck with you, Frank.

51:34.965 --> 51:36.366
Then get the fuck outta here.

51:45.674 --> 51:48.044
You guys having a
little lover's quarrel?

51:50.847 --> 51:51.946
Question for you.

51:51.948 --> 51:53.548
Which one of you's the top,

51:53.550 --> 51:54.951
which one of you's the bottom?

51:59.923 --> 52:01.992
I'm just fucking with you.

52:03.059 --> 52:05.194
But in all seriousness,
who's the bitch?

52:05.196 --> 52:06.728
That'd be him.

52:09.798 --> 52:11.533
What the fuck man?

52:15.839 --> 52:17.908
I'll fuck you up.

52:37.961 --> 52:40.228
Give me the goddamn keys.

52:40.230 --> 52:41.097
I'm driving.

52:57.746 --> 52:59.682
What about my sandwich?

53:08.325 --> 53:09.924
So now what?

53:09.926 --> 53:11.726
I know you have a plan.

53:11.728 --> 53:13.163
You need to tell me what it is.

53:14.097 --> 53:15.730
Plan?

53:15.732 --> 53:16.866
Get my kid.

53:18.001 --> 53:18.868
Kill Ochoa.

53:21.003 --> 53:22.471
And have a beer.

53:40.623 --> 53:42.125
Looks like they left in a hurry.

53:46.162 --> 53:47.029
Let's go.

53:48.864 --> 53:50.266
I know someone we can talk to.

54:00.643 --> 54:01.943
Where is he?

54:01.945 --> 54:05.548
If I were you homeboy
I would think really hard

54:06.216 --> 54:07.817
before I say something stupid.

54:11.754 --> 54:12.755
No shit.

54:14.656 --> 54:15.555
I know that man.

54:15.557 --> 54:17.325
What do I look stupid to you?

54:17.327 --> 54:19.726
Of course he's not here.

54:19.728 --> 54:21.697
I'm gonna give
you three seconds.

54:25.068 --> 54:26.434
One.

54:26.436 --> 54:27.937
Tell me where that house is.

54:29.440 --> 54:30.306
Two.

54:38.814 --> 54:39.846
Oh.

54:39.848 --> 54:40.716
Is that it?

54:41.784 --> 54:42.952
Is that his house, hmm?

55:10.380 --> 55:11.247
I like Mexico.

55:22.858 --> 55:23.725
Here.

55:24.626 --> 55:26.095
I brought you a little snack.

55:32.035 --> 55:33.269
I'll just leave the tray.

55:35.771 --> 55:37.140
In case you get hungry later.

55:40.877 --> 55:42.278
You can eat some later, huh?

55:49.885 --> 55:51.387
This was my little Nikki's room.

55:58.760 --> 55:59.963
She loved it.

56:01.831 --> 56:06.169
She used to say, "Daddy
this room is so beautiful."

56:08.438 --> 56:10.339
"It must be what heaven's like."

56:13.976 --> 56:17.311
I used to tell her,
"No, it's like heaven

56:17.313 --> 56:19.315
because an angel lives here."

56:26.256 --> 56:27.789
Now, now come on.

56:30.560 --> 56:31.792
You sure you don't want a bite?

56:31.794 --> 56:35.130
I don't want a bite, I
want to go home, please.

56:38.300 --> 56:39.168
You are home.

56:41.203 --> 56:46.209
Len.

56:59.488 --> 57:02.523
Leonard, Father Ramirez
suggested lighting a candle

57:02.525 --> 57:03.825
for Nikki tonight.

57:05.428 --> 57:06.695
Will you come with me?

57:20.176 --> 57:21.043
You're right.

57:22.311 --> 57:23.745
She's not ours.

57:27.517 --> 57:28.451
She's mine.

57:48.437 --> 57:51.004
I'm not stupid, Frank.

57:51.006 --> 57:52.941
And we said no secrets.

57:59.081 --> 58:03.217
The last two years you've
done nothing but lie to me.

58:03.219 --> 58:05.355
Who you are, what you are.

58:06.990 --> 58:11.994
This is a job for a surgeon.

58:14.631 --> 58:17.432
This is a job for a specialist.

58:19.434 --> 58:20.800
Our father
who art in heaven

58:20.802 --> 58:21.669
hallowed be thy name thy
kingdom come thy will be done

58:21.671 --> 58:23.905
on earth as it is in heaven.

58:25.040 --> 58:28.041
I need you, Frank.

58:28.043 --> 58:29.445
I need The Silencer.

58:49.064 --> 58:50.533
Fuck you.

59:07.082 --> 59:10.319
Okay, so he's in Mexico.

59:11.953 --> 59:14.588
Do you know exactly
where he is in Mexico?

59:14.590 --> 59:15.756
No.

59:15.758 --> 59:17.293
I mean that's a
big fucking country.

59:18.960 --> 59:19.993
And please don't
tell me you think

59:19.995 --> 59:22.062
we're just gonna
stumble upon him.

59:22.064 --> 59:23.565
Here's what I do know.

59:24.633 --> 59:27.600
Along the border
he's got strip clubs,

59:27.602 --> 59:31.104
whorehouses, gambling
spots, drug facilities.

59:31.106 --> 59:34.307
We'll hit each one,
talk to his people,

59:34.309 --> 59:38.246
between you and I we'll get the
fuckin' information we need.

59:39.247 --> 59:40.514
And we'll find his house.

59:40.516 --> 59:42.982
Do I look like I got
a fuckin' death wish?

01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.410
Why the fuck are
you helping me?

01:00:10.612 --> 01:00:12.314
You'd do the same for me.

01:00:15.717 --> 01:00:18.053
I don't know about that.

01:00:21.423 --> 01:00:22.290
Hey.

01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:27.028
Think God's gonna
forgive us for this?

01:00:31.066 --> 01:00:36.070
No.

01:02:41.228 --> 01:02:42.230
Jesus Christ.

01:02:43.698 --> 01:02:46.699
Ain't you got any real
food around this place?

01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:48.169
Hey what's your name again?

01:02:50.305 --> 01:02:51.504
Your name.

01:02:51.506 --> 01:02:52.374
El name-o?

01:02:54.744 --> 01:02:56.676
Well listen here, Marta.

01:02:56.678 --> 01:02:59.478
I need a burger, some fries...

01:03:00.314 --> 01:03:01.315
Some real fuckin' food.

01:03:06.388 --> 01:03:08.521
Now get your ass back in
the kitchen, get outta here.

01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:09.822
Si senor.

01:03:11.626 --> 01:03:12.959
Fuckin' creeps.

01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:14.227
Hello?

01:03:14.229 --> 01:03:15.261
Frank just hit
one of our factories.

01:03:15.263 --> 01:03:16.362
Wiped the cameras
and disappeared.

01:03:16.364 --> 01:03:18.533
You gotta fuckin'
be kidding me.

01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:25.607
He went off the fuckin' grid.

01:03:26.808 --> 01:03:29.274
- What?
- Frank, what is he, a ghost?

01:03:30.177 --> 01:03:31.145
One of our factories got hit.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:39.552
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

01:03:39.554 --> 01:03:41.021
I want everyone we've got
out on the fucking street.

01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:44.289
You cover the boss's house,
our girls downtown, everything.

01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:46.525
And if by some
miracle you find him,

01:03:46.527 --> 01:03:47.927
you better make sure he's
dead by the end of it.

01:03:47.929 --> 01:03:49.361
Do you understand me?

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.464
Relax Dracula.

01:03:51.633 --> 01:03:52.634
Frank's dog meat.

01:03:53.735 --> 01:03:55.102
Let's go guys, let's go.

01:03:57.639 --> 01:03:59.906
We'll see about that my man.

01:03:59.908 --> 01:04:03.278
Wow, what a fuck up.

01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:15.387
This is where all of
Ochoa's money gets laundered.

01:04:15.389 --> 01:04:16.856
So you know what?

01:04:16.858 --> 01:04:19.126
I'm gonna hit him
where it fuckin' hurts.

01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:15.314
How can I help you gentlemen?

01:05:15.316 --> 01:05:17.786
We're just here to pick
up the money drop for Ochoa.

01:05:18.987 --> 01:05:21.653
I didn't realize Nels
was expecting guests.

01:05:21.655 --> 01:05:22.923
It's a surprise.

01:05:24.692 --> 01:05:26.460
He's busy, I'll
take a message.

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:30.462
Mm, he's busy.

01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:34.967
Might wanna rethink your answer.

01:05:34.969 --> 01:05:35.970
Back room.

01:05:37.639 --> 01:05:39.038
Good boy.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.843
You'd keep quiet if you
knew what's best for you.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.748
Motherfuckers.

01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:07.569
Hey!

01:06:13.373 --> 01:06:14.673
Hey what the fuck?

01:06:14.675 --> 01:06:17.544
I told you not to get me
til three fuckin' thirty!

01:06:26.488 --> 01:06:27.455
Nice place.

01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:31.392
You rent it by the hour?

01:06:32.926 --> 01:06:35.161
Or does Ochoa take it
out of your allowance?

01:06:35.163 --> 01:06:37.198
Ask him yourself,
grease monkey.

01:06:41.136 --> 01:06:42.302
Oh I will.

01:06:43.905 --> 01:06:45.938
As soon as you tell
me where he is.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.342
You think that toy
scares me, motherfucker?

01:06:50.578 --> 01:06:52.914
Wrong answer, wanna try again?

01:06:57.584 --> 01:06:59.918
Try anything you want.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.388
I ain't telling you shit.

01:07:02.723 --> 01:07:04.190
Motherfucker!

01:07:05.726 --> 01:07:07.026
I'm gonna fuck your babies!

01:07:21.675 --> 01:07:22.509
Motherfucker!

01:07:35.056 --> 01:07:36.456
Who's the man now, bitch?

01:07:42.897 --> 01:07:44.062
Fuck.

01:07:44.064 --> 01:07:44.932
Fuck me.

01:07:50.137 --> 01:07:51.004
Fuck.

01:07:57.011 --> 01:07:58.110
Shit.

01:07:58.112 --> 01:08:00.081
Give me a minute, hold on.

01:08:01.648 --> 01:08:02.380
Fuck.

01:08:02.382 --> 01:08:04.351
Back up, back up.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.888
Back the fuck up.

01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:30.645
Fuck.

01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:35.883
If I tell ya, Ochoa'll kill me.

01:08:37.917 --> 01:08:41.020
I don't tell ya, you kill me.

01:08:44.758 --> 01:08:46.160
I'll take my chances with you.

01:08:47.728 --> 01:08:49.395
Then you got nothing to lose.

01:08:50.064 --> 01:08:52.932
You do not want to fuck with me.

01:08:52.934 --> 01:08:54.903
Where is he?

01:08:56.602 --> 01:08:58.537
Summer home's in
some shithole down.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.740
See?

01:09:01.742 --> 01:09:03.510
Life doesn't have
to be that hard.

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:07.613
You got a name for
that shithole town?

01:09:10.218 --> 01:09:11.250
Tepic.

01:09:11.252 --> 01:09:13.921
Sierra Vista Road,
way at the end.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.564
Kinda young, huh?

01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:29.334
I told ya, ain't
no such thing.

01:09:29.336 --> 01:09:30.201
Hmm.

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:33.272
Come on baby, come on.

01:09:33.274 --> 01:09:34.572
Sit over here, come on.

01:09:34.573 --> 01:09:35.442
It's okay.

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:37.111
Come on.

01:09:39.613 --> 01:09:41.548
My buddy here was
just about to leave.

01:09:42.951 --> 01:09:45.919
Unless of course you
want to take a slice.

01:09:49.323 --> 01:09:52.158
I'd rather knock every tooth
you had down your throat.

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:58.331
Fuck you.

01:10:12.746 --> 01:10:14.915
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

01:10:32.665 --> 01:10:34.034
You motherfucker.

01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:25.950
That's right.

01:11:25.952 --> 01:11:26.820
Bring the girl.

01:11:28.121 --> 01:11:29.222
I said bring the girl.

01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:33.224
They're coming.

01:11:53.447 --> 01:11:55.581
Here, let me do this.

01:12:04.157 --> 01:12:05.092
Let's go.

01:12:06.394 --> 01:12:07.125
What are you doing?

01:12:07.127 --> 01:12:08.460
I'm taking her inside.

01:12:08.462 --> 01:12:09.860
For what?

01:12:09.862 --> 01:12:11.298
'Cause it's cold.

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:14.065
Alright.

01:12:14.067 --> 01:12:15.266
It's okay, it's okay.

01:12:15.268 --> 01:12:16.767
It's okay, it's okay.

01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.995
Laz.

01:12:43.997 --> 01:12:45.029
Go ahead.

01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:46.900
We've got some
activity in town.

01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:50.036
You might wanna get down...

01:12:51.204 --> 01:12:52.072
Say again?

01:12:56.275 --> 01:12:57.442
Sir I have to get you inside.

01:12:57.444 --> 01:12:58.842
Oh, what the fuck?

01:12:58.844 --> 01:13:00.045
Come on, let's go.

01:13:01.515 --> 01:13:02.882
Bring Nikki.

01:13:23.068 --> 01:13:24.335
Where's Nikki?

01:13:24.337 --> 01:13:25.704
Where's Nikki?

01:13:26.972 --> 01:13:28.141
Get Nikki!

01:13:31.044 --> 01:13:33.478
Hey, I thought I told
you to scour that hill!

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.346
Give me that. To the
left, to the right.

01:13:35.348 --> 01:13:36.481
To the right!

01:13:36.483 --> 01:13:38.183
Hey Frank!

01:13:38.185 --> 01:13:39.450
Hey buddy!

01:13:39.452 --> 01:13:41.288
Check it out, check this out.

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:03.208
Come on, you wanna play, man?

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:03.944
What, now what?

01:14:06.213 --> 01:14:08.546
Roll faster, motherfucker, roll!

01:14:08.548 --> 01:14:10.080
Now what?

01:14:10.082 --> 01:14:10.914
Roll!

01:14:10.916 --> 01:14:11.784
Hey Laz.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.389
Not looking so good, buddy.

01:14:19.959 --> 01:14:20.994
Look who's talking.

01:14:22.295 --> 01:14:23.163
Yeah.

01:14:24.965 --> 01:14:26.032
Been a rough week.

01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:29.869
Where is she?

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:31.569
I don't know.

01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:32.504
You don't know.

01:14:35.575 --> 01:14:37.176
He won't give her up, Frank.

01:14:44.484 --> 01:14:46.353
You let me worry about that.

01:14:54.027 --> 01:14:55.892
He got your back now?

01:14:55.894 --> 01:14:59.532
Yeah, since before Folsom.

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:01.534
Huh.

01:15:03.202 --> 01:15:04.437
I'll tell you what, Laz.

01:15:06.506 --> 01:15:09.074
I might let you see those
golden years after all.

01:15:10.976 --> 01:15:13.411
You and your men lay
down your weapons

01:15:13.413 --> 01:15:16.316
and I'll let you walk away.

01:15:29.562 --> 01:15:31.329
I can't do that, Frank.

01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:52.485
I'm good.

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.185
Just go.

01:15:55.187 --> 01:15:56.389
I'll be back.

01:16:00.059 --> 01:16:01.359
Come on, come on let's go.

01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:03.896
I was so afraid I wasn't
gonna be able to find you.

01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:05.797
Come on.

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:07.165
I thought something
happened to you.

01:16:07.167 --> 01:16:09.232
I'll never let anything
happen to you my little Nikki,

01:16:09.234 --> 01:16:10.402
never, never.

01:16:15.642 --> 01:16:16.710
Come on, be careful.

01:16:20.413 --> 01:16:23.013
Nobody's ever gonna take
my Nikki away again.

01:16:23.015 --> 01:16:24.083
I'm not your Nikki!

01:16:26.252 --> 01:16:27.420
Neither am I.

01:16:28.388 --> 01:16:29.255
Frank!

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:33.123
Drop it, Len.

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:34.893
No you drop it, Frank.

01:16:36.295 --> 01:16:37.162
Kick it away.

01:16:40.265 --> 01:16:42.399
It's gonna be
alright Shannon, okay?

01:16:42.401 --> 01:16:43.300
I promise.

01:16:43.302 --> 01:16:45.938
Everything's gonna be alright.

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:53.778
No it's not, Frank.

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.445
It's not gonna be alright.

01:16:55.447 --> 01:16:57.182
What are you
gonna do Len, huh?

01:16:58.016 --> 01:17:01.184
You gonna shoot me in
front of my little girl?

01:17:01.186 --> 01:17:02.386
It's my little girl!

01:17:02.388 --> 01:17:03.255
No.

01:17:04.523 --> 01:17:07.960
I'm just doing what
every papa should do.

01:17:09.462 --> 01:17:11.431
Protect his little girl.

01:17:12.766 --> 01:17:15.568
Leonard, Leonard
please just look at me.

01:17:16.703 --> 01:17:19.302
Wasn't your fault what
happened to Nikki.

01:17:19.304 --> 01:17:21.438
It was an accident!

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.008
You have to let them go.

01:17:24.443 --> 01:17:27.377
No, I have to take
care of my Nikki.

01:17:27.379 --> 01:17:28.545
I have to protect her.

01:17:30.817 --> 01:17:32.284
Leonard, Nikki's gone.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.388
No she's not,
she's right here.

01:17:53.472 --> 01:17:54.339
Okay.

01:18:00.747 --> 01:18:03.450
One of us ain't walking
out of here alive, Frank.

01:18:04.484 --> 01:18:06.352
And since I'm the
one with a gun,

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.588
that might be you.

01:18:11.457 --> 01:18:13.992
Trust is like the silence
of the night, Frank.

01:18:15.394 --> 01:18:17.496
Once you lose it you
can't get it back.

01:18:19.598 --> 01:18:21.400
Maybe if I'd listened
to my old man

01:18:23.402 --> 01:18:25.003
we wouldn't be here like this

01:18:27.139 --> 01:18:28.608
and my nights'd be quieter.

01:19:03.442 --> 01:19:04.309
Trust, Frank.

01:19:06.278 --> 01:19:10.349
Sometimes you gotta
be quiet to hear, Len.

01:19:22.694 --> 01:19:24.596
Shannon, let's go home.

01:20:00.767 --> 01:20:01.633
Mommy!

01:20:06.606 --> 01:20:07.469
Mommy!

01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:08.738
Shannon!

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.373
Oh!

01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:12.274
Are you okay?

01:20:12.276 --> 01:20:13.144
Oh!

01:20:26.258 --> 01:20:27.125
Thank you.

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.526
Oh I love you so much.

01:20:29.528 --> 01:20:31.128
I love you Cass.

01:20:35.968 --> 01:20:38.635
Alright, I wanted to wish
everyone happy new year.

01:20:38.637 --> 01:20:41.371
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

01:20:41.373 --> 01:20:43.707
So I wanted
to thank Jen for putting out

01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:47.777
the refreshments, for Al for
putting out the literature,

01:20:48.814 --> 01:20:50.549
and for Pete for
setting up today.

01:20:51.918 --> 01:20:55.319
Now who would like to start
us out this afternoon?

01:21:02.394 --> 01:21:03.260
Hi.

01:21:06.665 --> 01:21:08.166
My name is Frank.
