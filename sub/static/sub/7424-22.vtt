<i>- From the moment we met...
- We knew our lives</i>

00:04.143 --> 00:05.559
<i>would never be the same.</i>

00:05.563 --> 00:06.873
<i>He saved my life.</i>

00:06.877 --> 00:08.677
<i>And she saved mine.</i>

00:08.680 --> 00:09.929
<i>We're destined.</i>

00:09.932 --> 00:11.774
<i>But we know it won't be easy.</i>

00:12.682 --> 00:14.904
<i>Even though we have
every reason to stay apart.</i>

00:15.681 --> 00:17.514
<i>We'll risk it all
to be together.</i>

00:17.519 --> 00:20.737
I am so in love with you.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.988
<i>Previously on
Beauty & the Beast:</i>

00:24.993 --> 00:28.311
I found him.

00:29.611 --> 00:32.444
But we got to get to him quick.

00:32.452 --> 00:33.720
You walk around
like yourself most of

00:33.721 --> 00:35.471
the time, right?
Without any meds?

00:35.476 --> 00:36.642
If I didn't take mine,

00:36.645 --> 00:38.678
<i>I'd be out of control
all the time.</i>

00:38.683 --> 00:40.349
<i>You want my DNA?</i>

00:40.354 --> 00:41.970
<i>Just a blood sample.</i>

00:41.974 --> 00:43.307
<i>Then he wouldn't need
the medication.</i>

00:43.311 --> 00:45.445
<i>I am happy to give you
some of my meds to try.</i>

00:45.450 --> 00:47.983
He keeps taking them,
they'll kill him,

00:47.988 --> 00:49.922
two, three years tops.

00:49.927 --> 00:53.495
Come on. Three good years
of us doing stuff like this.

00:53.504 --> 00:55.604
That's more of a future
than we had this morning.

00:55.607 --> 00:56.723
No, it isn't.

00:56.728 --> 00:58.177
I ran a test on Vincent's blood.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.814
It'll work.
Just one minor detail.

01:00.820 --> 01:04.239
What you need from him,
he won't survive.

01:04.245 --> 01:06.862

01:18.612 --> 01:20.112

01:21.853 --> 01:23.403
Yeah.

01:23.407 --> 01:26.324
And a drive out of the city
is always welcome,

01:26.330 --> 01:30.031
and who can resist
rosy-cheeked kids with cowboy hats?

01:31.510 --> 01:33.427
But what are we doing
out here?

01:33.432 --> 01:35.715
Well, you always say
how much you wish

01:35.721 --> 01:37.905
we could go
on a normal date.

01:37.909 --> 01:39.909
With the med's still
wearing off,

01:39.913 --> 01:42.563
there's no chance of me going
aggro just yet,

01:42.570 --> 01:44.287
so... you know, what better

01:44.290 --> 01:47.407

even edible?

02:17.203 --> 02:20.254
There's only one
way to find out.

02:21.797 --> 02:23.714
Uh, just one, please.

02:25.470 --> 02:26.770
Thank you.

02:32.956 --> 02:34.356

I'm sorry this couldn't
last longer.

02:49.029 --> 02:51.362
We both knew that taking
one little pill

02:51.367 --> 02:54.535
to suppress your grittier side
was too good to be true.

02:54.542 --> 02:58.044
Yeah, one little pill that has
one nasty, fatal side effect

02:58.050 --> 03:00.216
if I keep taking them.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.307
I know you can't and I would

03:02.311 --> 03:05.479
never want you
to be hurt, but...

03:07.790 --> 03:12.043
But it's nice to dream
for a few hours.

03:22.641 --> 03:24.826
You're not gonna
believe this.

03:24.833 --> 03:27.483
Kafka would be impressed.

03:27.488 --> 03:30.757
Why? What is
unbelievable, JT?

03:30.763 --> 03:35.999
The medicine, it's attacking
the zoo side of your DNA.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.607
Still?

03:37.614 --> 03:38.846
That's not possible.

03:38.848 --> 03:41.682
I mean, Gabe has to take
one of those pills

03:41.690 --> 03:43.374
every four hours
or it wears off.

03:43.378 --> 03:44.794
And have they with you?

03:44.796 --> 03:46.212
Well, no, but...

03:46.218 --> 03:47.500
Exactly.

03:47.503 --> 03:49.970
You may both be Frankenhumans,

03:49.974 --> 03:52.425
but you're not from the same
crop of experiments.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.265
Gabe was the first guinea pig.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.318
They made a lot
of progress since then.

03:56.325 --> 03:59.392
Maybe the pill works better
on you because you, my friend,

03:59.398 --> 04:03.367
are in a full-swing
biological metamorphosis.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.574
For the right generation
of the genetically altered,

04:06.580 --> 04:08.798
Muirfield created
that pill

04:08.805 --> 04:14.108
as a one-stop block
of all animal DNA.

04:14.117 --> 04:17.618
Okay, wait. What are you saying?

04:17.625 --> 04:20.442
If this battle of the animal
senses keeps up

04:20.447 --> 04:21.831
for another few days...

04:23.455 --> 04:25.456
...you could be cured.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.502
So, this is it.

04:37.507 --> 04:40.257
Vincent shows up tonight...

04:42.352 --> 04:45.187
You sure you can go
through with it?

04:47.062 --> 04:48.530
Taking his life?

04:48.533 --> 04:50.282
To save your own.

04:50.286 --> 04:54.205
Seems like the only option now.

04:54.214 --> 04:57.332
You can't take
those meds anymore.

04:57.337 --> 05:00.721
I mean, your bones, your
muscles, brain tissue,

05:00.729 --> 05:03.981
they're degenerating
at too rapid of a rate.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.722
And you're sure
this is the only way?

05:07.729 --> 05:10.197
Yeah.

05:10.202 --> 05:12.502
Look, Vincent's
feral state,

05:12.506 --> 05:14.406
it can be dormant
without medication.

05:14.412 --> 05:16.429
Yours can't.
We need enough thymus platelets

05:16.433 --> 05:19.250
in order to override
your tampered DNA.

05:19.256 --> 05:22.057
He's your only hope for getting
off those lethal pills

05:22.063 --> 05:24.764
and stopping you
from transforming 24-7.

05:24.770 --> 05:27.570
I still need to pick up
a few things.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.793
You can drop me at the office.

05:29.798 --> 05:31.465
I'll wrap some things up

05:31.468 --> 05:34.385
and let people know I'll be gone
for a few days.

05:34.393 --> 05:36.927
You know, it shouldn't
be this hard.

05:36.932 --> 05:40.183
All I ever wanted
was a normal life.

05:40.190 --> 05:44.476
And I assume that
life includes me?

05:55.009 --> 05:57.977
You know, I kind of like when
your animal side comes out.

05:57.984 --> 06:00.151
You're not gonna like it
in about four hours

06:00.155 --> 06:02.539
when my darker side shows up.

06:02.544 --> 06:06.295
No. But you'll be a good
match for Vincent then.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.740
<i>CATHERINE
Is it really true?</i>

06:24.747 --> 06:27.081
What JT found,
is this actually happening?

06:27.086 --> 06:28.302
Okay, I don't want to

06:28.305 --> 06:31.774
get my hopes up
just yet, but yeah.

06:31.781 --> 06:34.431
I can't believe it.

06:35.622 --> 06:38.490
Okay, after you called,

06:38.496 --> 06:42.248
I got something to celebrate.

06:42.256 --> 06:46.458
And I wanted to see
what you thought.

06:48.069 --> 06:50.970
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm over 21.

06:50.976 --> 06:52.693
I don't need fake IDs.

06:52.699 --> 06:55.033
No, you need a fake life.

06:56.339 --> 06:59.157
Okay, there were always
two things standing in our way:

06:59.162 --> 07:01.496
your uncontrollable side--

07:01.501 --> 07:05.220
which is no longer a problem--

07:05.229 --> 07:06.561
and Muirfield.

07:06.564 --> 07:09.649
You would just...

07:09.656 --> 07:11.155
leave everything?

07:11.159 --> 07:13.293
I found a town
like the one yesterday.

07:13.297 --> 07:16.882
It's about two hours
outside of Denver.

07:16.890 --> 07:20.758
It's small, but there are jobs.

07:20.765 --> 07:25.401
And, uh, and good schools,
just in case.

07:26.193 --> 07:28.561
Muirfield would never find us.

07:28.567 --> 07:31.084
Wow.

07:33.042 --> 07:35.076
Wow, I never knew
you wanted this.

07:35.082 --> 07:37.883
I didn't know
I wanted it either.

07:37.887 --> 07:40.605
I really never saw myself
settling down.

07:40.613 --> 07:44.898
But I've been thinking
about a lot of things

07:44.905 --> 07:47.573
that I didn't before I met you.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.798
But I couldn't see
a future until today,

07:50.803 --> 07:54.221
until you were...

07:54.229 --> 07:56.012
Normal.

07:56.016 --> 07:59.684
So, you would just
give this all up?

07:59.692 --> 08:00.974
What?

08:00.978 --> 08:04.480
Sewers and
burner phones and...

08:04.486 --> 08:09.489
JT and Tess and...

08:10.717 --> 08:13.502
Vincent, I'm sorry.

08:13.507 --> 08:17.175
There are gonna be sacrifices
no matter what we do.

08:17.183 --> 08:21.653
But JT is... he's building
a life with Sara.

08:21.661 --> 08:24.027
Yeah.

08:24.032 --> 08:26.633
And honestly, Tess
is better off if she

08:26.640 --> 08:29.558
doesn't have to lie to the
person she loves every day.

08:29.564 --> 08:30.947
You're right.

08:30.949 --> 08:35.885
We can finally look at a life
ahead of us

08:35.895 --> 08:39.614
instead of constantly looking
over our shoulders.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.530
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.941
Hey, Dad.

08:56.946 --> 08:59.246
Catherine, I need to meet you.

08:59.252 --> 09:01.553
Yeah, we can go for coffee
tomorrow or...

09:01.558 --> 09:04.392
No. I need
to see you now, alone.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.258
Dad!

09:25.013 --> 09:26.512
Dad!

09:40.066 --> 09:43.050
Someone call an ambulance!

10:10.767 --> 10:11.487
That should do it.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.592
We don't anticipate
your father needing

10:14.598 --> 10:16.098
any surgery
at this point

10:16.101 --> 10:18.268
but if there are
any complications,

10:18.272 --> 10:20.372
it's just best to have
a blood relative donate.

10:20.378 --> 10:22.044
Thanks.

10:33.944 --> 10:36.912
I saw Dr. Bell
in the hallway.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.201
She says Dad's
doing great.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.991
He doesn't look
so great to me.

10:42.681 --> 10:45.433
He's gonna be fine, Cat.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.837
Just a few broken ribs
and some internal bruising,

10:47.844 --> 10:49.177
but he's gonna be fine.

10:49.180 --> 10:52.031
Another foot or two
into that crosswalk,

10:52.038 --> 10:53.854
with that car
gunning for him,

10:53.858 --> 10:55.458
he never would
have made it.

10:55.464 --> 10:56.696
Gunning for him?

10:56.697 --> 10:58.080
Cat, it was
an accident.

10:58.085 --> 11:00.552
I'm not so sure.
Car came out of nowhere,

11:00.558 --> 11:02.892
breezed right through that light.
God, does everything

11:02.897 --> 11:04.513
have to be
a conspiracy with you?

11:04.518 --> 11:07.186
Can you please just sit
here and wait with him?

11:07.192 --> 11:09.992
Being a detective does not mean
that you have to try and find

11:09.997 --> 11:11.280
a criminal everywhere
you look, Cat.

11:11.284 --> 11:12.566
Can you please

11:12.569 --> 11:14.520
for once just be a
daughter, all right?

11:14.525 --> 11:17.008
Be a sister and
just wait with us?

11:17.014 --> 11:19.181
I have to do this, Heather.

11:37.628 --> 11:38.812
How is he?

11:38.816 --> 11:41.901
He's okay, I guess.

11:41.908 --> 11:44.641
You really didn't
need to come.

11:44.647 --> 11:45.747
I know, but I wanted to.

11:45.749 --> 11:46.748
No, I mean maybe

11:46.753 --> 11:48.719
you shouldn't have.

11:48.722 --> 11:51.490
I think Muirfield did this.

11:51.499 --> 11:53.665
That car veered
right at my dad.

11:53.668 --> 11:55.352
Why would they go after him?

11:55.355 --> 11:56.888
I'm not sure.

11:56.894 --> 11:59.177
But he said that he had
something he needed

11:59.181 --> 12:02.232
to show me and
he seemed rattled.

12:02.238 --> 12:04.855
I've got a security detail
on him and I'm gonna bring

12:04.863 --> 12:06.330
his stuff to our I.T. guys,

12:06.332 --> 12:07.864
see if they can get
it fired up again.

12:07.869 --> 12:09.686
Okay, well, I guess
if your mom worked for them,

12:09.691 --> 12:12.308
they might've kept tabs
on your dad, but...

12:12.313 --> 12:13.563
Hopefully it's nothing, okay?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.683
Let me help you--
I will go back to the scene.

12:15.688 --> 12:17.271
I will see if I pick
anything up.

12:17.275 --> 12:20.726
There's not much you can do.

12:23.089 --> 12:24.339
Anymore.

12:24.342 --> 12:25.908
I didn't mean...

12:25.912 --> 12:28.430
No, it's okay.

12:28.437 --> 12:30.770
I guess it's just a bit
of a readjustment

12:30.775 --> 12:32.358
for the both of us, huh?

12:34.314 --> 12:36.866
I will, uh, just lay low.

12:51.658 --> 12:53.140
Yeah, what is it?

12:53.144 --> 12:55.328
Little twist-- not a good one.

12:55.334 --> 12:57.034
I'm at Gabe's loft.

12:57.038 --> 12:59.121
Since when
did you start playing

12:59.126 --> 13:01.093
cloak and dagger with Gabe?

13:01.099 --> 13:03.466
Sorry, but protecting you
is my job.

13:03.471 --> 13:06.889
More than ever now that
your Spidey sense is on mute.

13:06.895 --> 13:08.844
Yeah, all right, thanks, JT.

13:08.849 --> 13:12.184
No biggie, but Tyler seemed
like she was hiding something.

13:12.189 --> 13:14.623
And she was-- they don't
just want a pint of blood.

13:14.629 --> 13:17.380
They want to harvest
your lymphatic system--

13:17.388 --> 13:20.172
spleen, thymus, bone marrow.

13:20.177 --> 13:22.928
So Gabe lied.

13:22.934 --> 13:25.234
They're gonna kill you.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.222
I'll destroy everything here.

13:27.226 --> 13:29.944
But I'd suggest
you RSVP as a regret

13:29.951 --> 13:32.585
to their little...
dissection party.

13:40.306 --> 13:41.940
Cat, what are you doing here?

13:41.945 --> 13:43.645
How's your dad?

13:43.649 --> 13:45.532
He's got a few broken bones,
banged up pretty badly,

13:45.539 --> 13:47.589
but he should pull through.

13:47.592 --> 13:49.576
I was hoping someone
from I.T. would be here.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.545
I need to get my dad's
pad and phone opened.

13:51.552 --> 13:52.835
See if there's
some clue as to

13:52.838 --> 13:54.621
why someone would want
to run him over.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.259
Want to run him over?

13:57.266 --> 13:58.465
He said it was important
I talked to him.

13:58.470 --> 13:59.686
He seemed pretty shaken.

13:59.688 --> 14:01.488
Okay, but there are
750 car accidents

14:01.493 --> 14:03.526
every day in this city--
it's more likely...

14:03.530 --> 14:05.864
No, there has to be something
in his things that he wanted

14:05.869 --> 14:07.335
to show me something
important enough

14:07.340 --> 14:10.324
that they had to stop him.
Cat, come on, stop.

14:10.329 --> 14:13.464
Look, I will track down

14:13.472 --> 14:15.856
a techno nerd and see if
there's anything on here.

14:15.861 --> 14:18.061
But all this running around,

14:18.067 --> 14:21.034
I-I get the sense there's
something else going on.

14:26.201 --> 14:28.887
I can't just sit there.

14:33.519 --> 14:36.187
Every time I look at him,
I see...

14:36.192 --> 14:40.161
my mother lying in that parking
lot, bleeding to death.

14:40.169 --> 14:44.171
You know, it's getting
harder to remember the last time

14:44.179 --> 14:47.263
in my life anything felt normal.

14:47.268 --> 14:49.685
I'm sorry.

14:53.317 --> 14:55.284
And, look, I'm not
trying to be a bitch,

14:55.287 --> 14:57.704
but you have to get past it.

14:57.712 --> 14:59.579
You have to go
to that hospital,

14:59.581 --> 15:02.114
you have to sit
next to his bed

15:02.121 --> 15:03.972
and be there
for your sister.

15:03.976 --> 15:05.492
They need you.

15:05.496 --> 15:07.295
And, look,

15:07.300 --> 15:09.434
I-I promise if I find
anything on here,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.573
I'll call you
immediately, okay?

15:12.529 --> 15:14.998
Okay.

15:15.003 --> 15:18.170
Thanks, Tess.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.877
Is he there already?

15:42.686 --> 15:44.219
He's not coming.

15:44.222 --> 15:45.889
Gabe, they tossed your place.

15:45.891 --> 15:49.126
Everything is destroyed.

15:49.134 --> 15:51.617
Security camera showed
that JT Forbes did it,

15:51.624 --> 15:55.242
so I don't think Vincent has
any interest in dying tonight.

15:56.418 --> 15:57.718
My variable centrifuge

15:57.722 --> 15:59.321
is a giant heap of parts.

15:59.324 --> 16:01.191
Go find another one.

16:01.196 --> 16:03.229
Why? How are you gonna
get him here?

16:03.234 --> 16:06.268
Every man has a weakness,

16:06.275 --> 16:08.442
and I know what Vincent's is.

16:22.331 --> 16:25.032
You and I are gonna take
a little drive in the country.

16:29.331 --> 16:31.799
I just need it on.
Well, I, uh...

16:31.803 --> 16:33.653
sort of deduced that

16:33.659 --> 16:35.342
even without a badge.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.098
Okay.

16:38.103 --> 16:40.937
You don't even
remotely comprehend

16:40.942 --> 16:43.175
what's behind this little
piece of glass, do you?

16:43.180 --> 16:44.564
Absolutely not.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.234
That's what they pay you for,

16:46.238 --> 16:47.737
but apparently only one
of us can actually

16:47.742 --> 16:48.958
do their job, so...

16:48.960 --> 16:51.377
Hold on, just-just
give me a second.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.053
Okay? Um... hmm.

16:54.058 --> 16:56.808
Okay, let's see this, uh...

16:56.814 --> 16:58.881
Oh, hmm.

17:01.139 --> 17:03.557
Yup, okay, here we go.

17:03.562 --> 17:04.744
Look at that.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.534
Two of us doing our job.

17:07.540 --> 17:08.856
Oh!

17:08.859 --> 17:10.742
You owe me dinner.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.290
Not finding any
retrievable information.

17:30.294 --> 17:33.312
Whoever beat us here,
they wiped everything.

17:41.537 --> 17:44.172
You sure Lowan didn't do this?

17:44.179 --> 17:45.561
I doubt it.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.298
We may not have known
Lowan was still alive,

17:47.300 --> 17:49.667
but... someone did.

17:49.675 --> 17:51.842
Killed all his research.

17:51.845 --> 17:53.879
Well...

17:53.884 --> 17:56.034
let's find out who it was.

17:56.040 --> 17:59.158
And bring in Lowan.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.780
I did not come all this way
to let him slip

18:01.787 --> 18:03.970
through my fingers again.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.911
I've been here before.

18:20.918 --> 18:23.052
As a child.

18:23.055 --> 18:24.354
Your mom brought you
one day to play

18:24.358 --> 18:25.757
when she came
to check on me.

18:25.760 --> 18:29.779
I was wondering
if you'd remember.

18:29.786 --> 18:32.487
Is this really how
you want to repay her

18:32.494 --> 18:34.828
for rescuing you
from those labs?

18:34.834 --> 18:37.450
Vincent was willing
to give you his blood.

18:37.456 --> 18:40.558
Sadly that's not enough and
Vincent figured it out.

18:40.564 --> 18:42.063
I didn't realize
until yesterday

18:42.066 --> 18:44.901
just how comprehensive
the procedure would be.

18:46.528 --> 18:48.579
You're gonna kill him.

18:48.584 --> 18:50.784
He's not a beast anymore.

18:50.788 --> 18:52.121
He took your pills.

18:52.124 --> 18:54.040
They had a different
effect on him than you.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.062
He doesn't need to
take another one.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.221
I know what you're trying
to do, Catherine.

19:00.228 --> 19:02.195
And you won't stop me
from moving forward

19:02.198 --> 19:04.081
because Vincent looks normal.

19:04.087 --> 19:05.587
Everything they've done

19:05.590 --> 19:07.373
to him is still
in his system.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.245
He's still in transition.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.510
I imagine the sacrifice
hasn't been easy

19:16.516 --> 19:18.049
for him though, has it?

19:18.052 --> 19:20.603
What, being back to normal?

19:20.610 --> 19:22.827
Tyler used to say that--
"normal."

19:22.830 --> 19:25.230
Which only reminded me
how much I'm not.

19:26.690 --> 19:28.924
We all want the same thing,
Catherine--

19:28.930 --> 19:31.464
to fit in, to find love.

19:31.470 --> 19:35.272
As incredible as it feels
to taste that power,

19:35.279 --> 19:39.231
strength to do things
men can only dream of doing,

19:39.237 --> 19:42.104
anyone would sacrifice that

19:42.110 --> 19:45.128
for a chance
at simple human happiness.

19:45.136 --> 19:47.386
He won't come.

19:47.389 --> 19:48.889
You know he will.

19:48.894 --> 19:50.477
He loves you.

19:51.766 --> 19:53.967
He would give up
his life to save you.

20:12.534 --> 20:13.784
Where is he?

20:13.787 --> 20:15.870
I'll have him here soon.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.358
Soon was an hour ago.

20:17.362 --> 20:18.912
The longer you're progressed,

20:18.917 --> 20:21.367
the harder it's gonna be
to manage your sedation levels.

20:21.371 --> 20:23.704
Just have everything ready.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.476
You're running out
of time, Lowan.

20:28.688 --> 20:30.473
I won't call him.

20:30.476 --> 20:31.891
Yeah, you will.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.099
I have your phone.

20:36.457 --> 20:38.708
Cat? Cat?

20:42.470 --> 20:43.887
Hey, where have you been?

20:43.893 --> 20:45.443
We've been trying to warn...

20:45.447 --> 20:47.781
Too late-- I'd tell you
to calm down, but I hear

20:47.786 --> 20:49.702
your anger issues aren't
a problem anymore.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.773
What have you done with her?
She's here.

20:51.776 --> 20:52.926
She's fine.

20:52.931 --> 20:54.497
You hold up your end
of the agreement

20:54.502 --> 20:56.135
and nothing will happen to her.

20:56.138 --> 20:57.304
Look, I don't believe you, okay?

20:57.308 --> 20:58.858
I want to see her-- put her on.

21:00.934 --> 21:02.485
Vincent, I'm fine.

21:02.488 --> 21:04.221
Don't come--
he's gonna kill you...

21:05.108 --> 21:06.775
Yeah... Cat!

21:06.781 --> 21:08.281
6268 Rochester Court.

21:08.285 --> 21:10.085
You're not here within the hour,

21:10.089 --> 21:11.588
you won't see Catherine again.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.878
I'm sorry, Catherine.

21:27.883 --> 21:31.134
I know what it's like
to be locked in here.

22:03.664 --> 22:04.926
<i>I found the centrifuge
replacement</i>

22:04.927 --> 22:06.527
for the one that Keller
and his whiz kid destroyed.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.267
So we're back on track?

22:08.270 --> 22:09.720
Assuming you get to Keller
in time.

22:09.724 --> 22:11.940
I'll handle Keller.
What's your ETA?

22:11.945 --> 22:13.228
I'm sending the lab assistant
over to you

22:13.233 --> 22:14.666
with the new equipment.

22:14.670 --> 22:17.353
I'll be there within the hour,
all right?

22:21.836 --> 22:23.035
Whoa, she's got a gun!

22:27.232 --> 22:28.514
Take it, take it.

22:28.519 --> 22:29.819
Whiz kid, huh?

22:29.822 --> 22:31.605
How did you know to
destroy the centrifuge?

22:31.611 --> 22:32.893
Imagine that.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.411
Beautiful mysterious woman,

22:34.414 --> 22:35.947
deadly politician beastman...

22:35.952 --> 22:37.752
call it a wild hunch.

22:37.758 --> 22:39.258
Well, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

22:39.261 --> 22:40.593
Because if you don't show,

22:40.597 --> 22:42.047
he's going to kill
your girlfriend.

22:42.051 --> 22:44.918
Thanks for volunteering
to be our bargaining chip.

22:47.529 --> 22:49.163
Okay, change of plan.

22:49.169 --> 22:50.435
I'm not playing games, Vincent.

22:50.438 --> 22:51.436
Neither am I.

22:51.441 --> 22:54.493
Here, take a look at this.

22:59.759 --> 23:01.343
Catherine for Tyler.

23:01.348 --> 23:03.481
Maybe you got more time
than you think.

23:03.487 --> 23:05.604
Why don't we just work together
and find another way?

23:05.607 --> 23:07.407
You're a terrible liar, Vincent.

23:07.412 --> 23:10.163
You're not gonna forgive me
for taking the woman you love.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.036
Just as I'm not gonna
forgive you.

23:12.038 --> 23:14.038
Just tell me where we trade.

23:14.043 --> 23:17.011
And what are you gonna do
if I refuse?

23:17.019 --> 23:19.086
I'll kill her.

23:21.009 --> 23:23.144
Go ahead.

23:23.150 --> 23:24.566
Kill her.

23:33.425 --> 23:35.642
Betrayal's a bitch, isn't it?

23:37.015 --> 23:38.933
You think he'd
go through with it?

23:38.938 --> 23:40.187
With Catherine?

23:40.191 --> 23:41.507
I guess we do what we have to

23:41.512 --> 23:42.945
in order to save ourselves.

23:43.899 --> 23:45.400
That's a yes.

23:47.038 --> 23:49.039
There's only one way
out of this.

23:49.045 --> 23:51.245
What, you're gonna
just walk right in there?

23:51.250 --> 23:53.517
So, suicide--

23:53.522 --> 23:55.305
that's how this all ends?

23:57.365 --> 23:59.033
From what Tyler said, he'll...

23:59.036 --> 24:00.618
he'll be completely
off his meds.

24:00.623 --> 24:01.939
Full beast.

24:01.943 --> 24:03.960
JT, before any of this happened,

24:03.964 --> 24:05.630
I was a soldier first.

24:05.634 --> 24:07.051
I know what I'm doing.

24:11.899 --> 24:14.701
Bravery isn't going to do it
if you want to save Catherine.

24:16.159 --> 24:18.060
Promise me you won't hurt him.

24:18.066 --> 24:19.632
I won't kill him.

24:21.655 --> 24:23.206
Why, what do you know?

24:23.210 --> 24:24.810
You both know that

24:24.815 --> 24:26.215
Vincent's transition
isn't complete.

24:26.218 --> 24:28.118
So in this window
of metamorphosis,

24:28.122 --> 24:31.090
there's one thing that can stop
the change, even reverse it.

24:33.015 --> 24:35.016
Your own immune system.

24:35.022 --> 24:37.689
I'm an idiot.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.794
Any vaccine,
flu or tetanus,

24:39.801 --> 24:41.200
anything that causes
your immune system

24:41.203 --> 24:42.469
to go into overdrive...

24:42.474 --> 24:43.924
It'll boost your own body

24:43.928 --> 24:45.227
in order to fight
off everything,

24:45.230 --> 24:46.712
including the cure.

24:48.521 --> 24:51.906
So if I reverse this,
went back to the way I was...

24:51.912 --> 24:54.146
it would be for good?

24:58.178 --> 25:01.413
You yourself said how things
feel numb as a mere mortal.

25:01.420 --> 25:03.637
That you'd finally found
what gave you purpose:

25:03.640 --> 25:05.590
using your beasty-boy for good.

25:05.596 --> 25:07.095
And I gave it all up

25:07.099 --> 25:10.034
to have a peaceful,
normal life with Catherine.

25:10.039 --> 25:12.122
And I would do it again.

25:12.128 --> 25:15.163
Vincent, we're talking
about Catherine's life.

25:15.169 --> 25:18.286
What if your beastly strength
is the only way to save her?

25:18.294 --> 25:20.794
I can do it the way I am.

25:21.766 --> 25:23.701
I can't go back.

25:38.725 --> 25:40.693
I thought you might be hungry.

25:46.410 --> 25:49.246
I doubt it'll surprise you
that I don't really have

25:49.252 --> 25:50.517
much of an appetite.

25:50.521 --> 25:51.737
You have to know...

25:51.739 --> 25:53.256
if there was any other way

25:53.260 --> 25:54.709
for me to stay alive...

25:56.651 --> 25:58.202
You'd do the same thing
I'm doing.

25:58.205 --> 26:01.690
I guess when you've had
a difficult childhood,

26:01.697 --> 26:03.713
things take on their
own perspective.

26:04.569 --> 26:06.303
So what happened?

26:06.307 --> 26:08.607
After my mom saved you
and left you here?

26:09.515 --> 26:11.049
Were they a good family?

26:11.052 --> 26:14.053
They tried to be.

26:14.060 --> 26:16.194
But it was terrifying.

26:20.958 --> 26:23.443
I was maybe nine, ten.

26:23.449 --> 26:26.217
I may have looked
like a monster to them,

26:26.223 --> 26:28.173
but I was just a boy.

26:28.178 --> 26:31.128
And it was dark.

26:33.238 --> 26:34.471
And I was scared.

26:34.476 --> 26:37.444
And now?

26:37.451 --> 26:38.867
Where are they?

26:42.044 --> 26:45.179
I was at a party one night,

26:45.185 --> 26:47.169
wanting to feel normal for once,

26:47.173 --> 26:50.407
and I lost track of time
and I skipped my meds.

26:50.415 --> 26:54.684
And when I got home,
I had already turned,

26:55.542 --> 26:58.260
and my mom tried to stop me,

26:58.265 --> 27:02.418
and without meaning to,
I shoved her.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.648
She landed at the bottom
of the staircase.

27:10.578 --> 27:12.863
My father died
not long after.

27:12.870 --> 27:15.253
Maybe from a broken heart...

27:17.011 --> 27:20.412
...maybe he just needed
an escape from me.

27:22.122 --> 27:27.360
Their love had to brave some
pretty extraordinary situations.

27:27.370 --> 27:30.437
It's not easy loving
someone like me.

27:58.727 --> 28:00.678
No.

28:00.683 --> 28:01.899
No, not yet!

28:01.902 --> 28:03.368
Gabe!

28:03.372 --> 28:05.706
It's for your own protection.

28:13.395 --> 28:17.165
You really think it's too
difficult to recreate a cure?

28:17.172 --> 28:19.388
Less difficult with me.

28:26.260 --> 28:27.977
So tell me, JT,

28:27.981 --> 28:29.814
what was your first
big breakthrough?

28:29.821 --> 28:31.604
Irregularities in glycolysis.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.559
Nice.

28:33.561 --> 28:35.645
You know, I never landed
on respiration.

28:35.651 --> 28:38.335
I was always focused on
eukaryotic cell structures,

28:38.341 --> 28:40.107
so I never was looking
at behaviors.

28:40.111 --> 28:41.827
Oh, it took months,

28:41.832 --> 28:43.465
because Vincent's samples
actually didn't display

28:43.469 --> 28:44.785
that many differences.

28:44.788 --> 28:46.304
Then I started to notice

28:46.309 --> 28:49.561
an altered pattern
in the ETC, and... bam!

28:49.567 --> 28:50.999
Nice.

28:51.003 --> 28:52.520
Feels good, right?

28:52.523 --> 28:54.439
Whenever you have one
of those "eureka" moments.

28:54.444 --> 28:57.311
You're the one who figured out
this pill-slash-cure.

28:59.489 --> 29:00.807
Truth?

29:00.810 --> 29:03.460
I just took
a synthesized version

29:03.466 --> 29:06.150
of the pills that Gabe had been
taking since he was a child

29:06.156 --> 29:08.940
and I altered them
according to some research

29:08.948 --> 29:11.099
I stole from Muirfield.
Ooh...

29:11.103 --> 29:13.486
Sometimes you wonder

29:13.490 --> 29:15.190
how you ended up
in all this, right?

29:15.195 --> 29:17.862
I used to think running
for Science Club President

29:17.868 --> 29:19.301
was a challenge.

29:22.159 --> 29:23.893
So how does this work?

29:23.900 --> 29:26.234
Am I deprived of
all food and water?

29:26.238 --> 29:29.155
Oh, uh, selection's not great.

29:29.161 --> 29:30.611
We've got beer and...

29:35.243 --> 29:37.261
Sorry.

29:37.267 --> 29:39.416
Survival of the fittest.

29:39.419 --> 29:41.303
You understand.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.728
You...

29:59.015 --> 30:00.266
Please.

30:00.272 --> 30:01.704
No.

30:42.878 --> 30:44.397
Little help?

30:49.043 --> 30:51.661
Really?

30:51.667 --> 30:53.700
Vengeful siren of deceit.

30:53.704 --> 30:55.037
I knew something was up

30:55.041 --> 30:56.206
when Cat never showed
at the hospital, but...

30:56.211 --> 30:58.012
Gabe took Cat.

30:58.015 --> 31:00.214
Vincent went after her and we
tried using Tyler as a trade.

31:00.219 --> 31:03.538
Then what, Girl Friday
got the jump on you?

31:03.546 --> 31:04.612
She spoke geek

31:04.615 --> 31:06.231
and lured you onto the rocks

31:06.235 --> 31:07.784
with her polysyllabic phrases?

31:07.788 --> 31:09.121
You're funnier when
I'm not dehydrated

31:09.125 --> 31:10.408
and annoyed at your gender.

31:10.412 --> 31:11.911
Can you just get these off?

31:14.203 --> 31:16.087
Whoa, wait!

31:16.878 --> 31:19.163
Don't you even
check the trajectory

31:19.165 --> 31:20.597
for ricochets or
something first?

31:20.602 --> 31:22.185
Geez.

31:22.190 --> 31:23.657
I'm going to take that
as a thank you.

31:23.661 --> 31:24.910
Where'd she go?

31:24.914 --> 31:26.297
Back to Gabe's, I imagine.

31:26.300 --> 31:27.949
But it's bad.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.054
Gabe's gotta be full-throttle
mono-brow by now,

31:30.059 --> 31:31.509
and Vincent's...

31:31.514 --> 31:33.681
lost his edge.

31:33.685 --> 31:34.984
All right, great.

31:34.988 --> 31:36.354
And we may have another problem.

31:49.054 --> 31:50.504
Oh.

31:50.507 --> 31:52.324
Looks like the swelling
has started to subside.

31:52.329 --> 31:55.030
We'll be able to pull him
out of the induced coma soon.

31:55.036 --> 31:56.986
But the left leg
is more than fractured,

31:56.990 --> 31:58.573
it's shattered.

31:58.578 --> 31:59.827
Your father's going
to need surgery

31:59.831 --> 32:01.547
and we need
a family blood donor.

32:01.552 --> 32:03.919
Oh, my sister's
already given some blood.

32:03.923 --> 32:07.392
Unfortunately, Catherine's blood
contained no common identifiers

32:07.399 --> 32:10.049
with your father.
Okay?

32:10.054 --> 32:13.472
Uh, Ms. Chandler,
all children's blood

32:13.480 --> 32:15.180
should contain
some common identifier

32:15.185 --> 32:16.901
with the birth parent.

32:16.905 --> 32:19.956
It's customary to confirm
any irregularities in our test

32:19.961 --> 32:21.428
with a DNA test.

32:21.433 --> 32:23.582
I'm not quite following.

32:23.587 --> 32:26.439
There's no easy way
to say this.

32:26.443 --> 32:29.694
There was no match between
Catherine and your father.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.755
Catherine?

33:36.761 --> 33:38.028
Stand back!

33:38.034 --> 33:39.700
Stand back!

33:46.286 --> 33:48.971
Picked the wrong day to be going
back to being normal.

34:06.633 --> 34:08.051
Where are they?
I didn't see them.

34:08.054 --> 34:10.922
I wish I had my
strength back.

34:11.781 --> 34:14.483
Vincent, be honest,
did you take

34:14.487 --> 34:16.404
those pills because
you thought I wanted

34:16.408 --> 34:18.858
a more normal future
or because you did?

34:18.864 --> 34:20.864
I thought we both did.

34:20.868 --> 34:23.335
Isn't that why
you got those fake IDs?

34:23.342 --> 34:25.007
That was your idea, remember?

34:25.011 --> 34:28.012
Because you said
you never really saw

34:28.018 --> 34:29.935
a future for us
until I was normal.

34:29.942 --> 34:33.560
Well, maybe I wasn't looking...

34:33.565 --> 34:35.815
for any future.

34:35.822 --> 34:38.757
But I can see it now.

34:38.762 --> 34:41.344
Beast or no beast.

34:41.351 --> 34:44.302
It really doesn't matter to you?

34:46.764 --> 34:50.449
I should have listened
to JT and turned back.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.290
Turned back?

34:53.295 --> 34:56.746
Apparently I'm still
in a transitional stage.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.272
If I get a vaccine,

34:58.276 --> 35:00.559
any vaccine, it'll
increase my antibodies,

35:00.564 --> 35:04.132
it'll fight off the medicine,
and I will turn back.

35:05.809 --> 35:07.644
Run!

35:59.405 --> 36:02.439
Where's your medicine cabinet?
I need a vaccine.

36:20.102 --> 36:21.703
Okay.

36:26.634 --> 36:27.951
Vincent!

36:29.759 --> 36:32.628
I can't let you
die for me.
