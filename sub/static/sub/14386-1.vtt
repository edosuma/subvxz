WEBVTT

02:26.521 --> 02:28.740
You're awfully quiet tonight, Janey.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.035
I've been trying to think
of just the right way to ask you

02:32.152 --> 02:33.529
to turn around and go back.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.406
On this road? Can't do it, sweetie.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.625
I mean it, Alan. I'd like you
to turn around, please.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.330
What's the matter, Jane?

02:42.454 --> 02:44.252
I... I tried to tell you
before we left home.

02:44.373 --> 02:47.047
I... I just don't like
being patronized, that's all.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.420
I... I don't think I can take
another evening of it.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.764
Patronized? Oh, sweetheart,
Ralph is one of the nicest guys I...

02:52.881 --> 02:55.259
You know it isn't Ralph.

02:55.384 --> 02:59.184
It's his diamond-studded wife,
looking down her nose at me like...

02:59.304 --> 03:02.604
like her big ugly house up there
looks down on Hollywood.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.774
Please. I'm just not going.
Slow down and find a place to turn.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.989
Oh, Jane, you're crazy. Alice likes you.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.076
Please, Alan. I mean it.
I'm just not going.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.336
What are you trying to do?
Send us off the edge?

03:28.917 --> 03:32.046
All right. We'll turn around.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.390
We told 'em we'd be there,
but we'll turn around.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.392
That guy almost hit us!

03:45.517 --> 03:47.940
Alan, he threw something.
It's in the back.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.157
Feels like there's paper in it.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.372
- Paper?
- Yeah, feels like it.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.614
Open it.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.583
- They threw it in?
- Yes.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.670
- Maybe it fell in.
- Alan, open it.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.694
Quick, Alan, get in. Alan, get in!

04:47.996 --> 04:50.590
He's after us, Jane.
The bag was intended for him.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.176
Jane, what are you trying to do?

05:19.361 --> 05:22.740
We've lost him. Slow down.
I'll take the wheel.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.709
Well, you almost killed us doing it,
but we got away from him.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.633
- Now what happens?
- It hasn't hit you yet, Alan?

05:36.753 --> 05:39.757
The money was literally
thrown in our laps.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.054
No one in the world knows we have it.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.519
Get a hold of yourself, Jane, will you?
It's a bag of dynamite.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.637
That was a payoff.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.605
Probably blackmail. We turn that bag
over to the police so they...

05:51.393 --> 05:53.691
Don't stop, Alan.
He's almost a block behind.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.897
- What are you two so scared about?
- Who's scared?

06:29.014 --> 06:31.642
You are. Didn't you ever
get a ticket before?

06:32.976 --> 06:36.150
Ha-ha! It's supposed
to be a big secret, Officer.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.273
But we're on our way to Las Vegas.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.901
We're the old-fashioned kind.
We're eloping.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.404
You're still gonna get a ticket.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.407
The next time you make a turn, signal.
You think you can remember that?

06:46.531 --> 06:49.455
I... I'm afraid my mind
wasn't on my driving.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.171
You're nervous, Mac. It's the bride
that's supposed to be jittery.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.667
- Get going.
- All right.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.262
What's the matter with you, Jane?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.675
What were you planning on doing with that?

07:07.302 --> 07:09.270
I don't know.

07:13.642 --> 07:17.647
You had a chance to give up
the money. Why didn't you take it?

07:17.771 --> 07:21.617
I was just asking myself
that same question.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.986
We'll take it up to the apartment.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.238
I want to look at it.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.305
I don't see him, Alan.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.470
What about Kathy?
I wonder if she came home yet.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.140
I think she went to a show. Hurry.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.270
Just call me Dracula.

07:59.396 --> 08:03.401
- I'm afraid you did startle us a little.
- Did my sister come in yet, Pete?

08:03.525 --> 08:06.199
Uh... no, I don't think so.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.697
Hey, uh... you folks been away?

08:09.531 --> 08:13.456
Oh, no. Just some things
Mr. Palmer had in storage.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.442
- Did you lock the door?
- Yes.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.946
Well, that wasn't very smart.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.950
Be a great time for Kathy or someone
to come in now, wouldn't it?

08:53.074 --> 08:57.329
You said you wanted to look at it,
Alan. Look at it.

08:57.454 --> 09:02.130
Fifties and twenties.
There must be thousands here.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.969
Yeah, probably 100,000.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.261
It's old money. The numbers are different.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.477
You could make it work for us
for the rest of our lives.

09:14.345 --> 09:18.100
Stop it, Janey. If we don't report this,
it's a felony, the same as stealing it.

09:19.684 --> 09:23.279
It's a blind alley
with a big barred gate at the end.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.284
Let's not try to use it, darling.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.621
Let's just hide it some place, and then
not touch it until we know it's safe.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.582
It'll never be safe. It just won't work.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.083
What is it, Jane?
I just don't understand you.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.174
I've tried to give you everything
you wanted, everything I could.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.418
Yes, you've given me a dozen
down payments and instalments

09:44.542 --> 09:46.670
for the rest of our lives.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.473
We won't touch it, Alan.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.601
We'll simply leave it where we...

10:02.519 --> 10:04.521
Hide it.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.413
Hide it, quick.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.258
- Hi.
- Hello, Kathy.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.006
Pete said you were asking about me.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.601
Oh, yes. Alan was wondering
if you were home.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.187
Well, I am. And since you're
twisting my arm, I'll come in.

10:41.391 --> 10:44.986
- Where's my dear brother?
- Oh, he'll be out in a moment.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.447
How are things at the office?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.566
Well, they gave my boss
a promotion the other day.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.944
Maybe they'll get around
to giving me a raise later.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.821
You sound as if you're going
to make a life's work out of it.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.574
You sound as if you haven't
heard of the man shortage.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.202
On second thought, maybe you haven't.

11:02.787 --> 11:06.212
- Greetings, Kathy.
- Hi. How are you?

11:07.083 --> 11:10.007
Now don't say fine, 'cause you look awful.

11:16.426 --> 11:20.021
That's why I love to come here.
Everyone is so gay, so buoyant.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.069
I did get the impression from Pete that
you wanted to see me about something.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.611
Oh, er... we were thinking of
running up to Rimoli's for a snack,

11:29.731 --> 11:32.405
but we changed our minds.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.493
Alan doesn't feel well.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.409
- Well, what is it, Alan?
- Oh, nothing.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.497
It's just a headache.

11:41.284 --> 11:45.255
Well, I hope you both feel better
in the morning. Good night.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.053
- Good night, Jane.
- Good night, Kathy.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.057
That did it.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.025
I ought to have my head examined.
I was almost sold for a minute.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.567
But we've got as much right to that money

12:10.688 --> 12:14.409
as if we went into a bank
and lifted a bagful off the counter.

12:14.525 --> 12:18.120
My little sister drops in, and pays us
a visit, and scares us to death.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.242
Of course we were frightened,
because the money's right here.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.870
But once it's hidden and out of our
hands, there's nothing to be afraid of.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.213
- Nobody knows we have it.
- Nobody knows?

12:27.330 --> 12:30.334
How about that banshee that
chased us down the mountainside?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.594
If he can read,
he's got our license number.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.715
He wasn't close enough to see our license.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.430
Listen to me, Alan.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.477
I love you, darling,

12:45.598 --> 12:48.727
and if you decide we should never
touch the money, we won't.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.355
But do we have to make up our minds now?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.482
Can't we just hide it some place
where it can't be traced to us

12:54.607 --> 12:56.985
and give ourselves time to think it out?

12:57.110 --> 13:00.080
Please help me hide it.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.870
I'll leave the rest to you.

13:02.991 --> 13:06.461
If you don't think we should
ever touch it, we won't.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.673
You mean that, Jane? There'll be no
more talk about it? No bitterness?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.963
I mean it, Alan.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.263
We'll keep it a week.

13:20.675 --> 13:24.521
'Last call for the Santa Fe
- San Bernadino local.

13:24.637 --> 13:29.894
'Train number 42 leaves at 10:10,
entering through gate M.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.986
'This is the last call.

13:37.066 --> 13:42.448
'The Union Pacific City of Los Angeles
train 103 is now arriving.'

13:47.535 --> 13:50.835
It's done. Everything's all right
now, isn't it, darling?

13:50.955 --> 13:52.582
Yeah, I... I guess so.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.709
Where's the ticket?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.717
It's all right.
It's here down in the lining.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.436
There's a hole in the pocket.
It's safe there.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.147
What did you say
to the man at the counter?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.608
I didn't say anything
to the man at the counter.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.194
But you did. I saw you.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.483
Oh. Oh, yes.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.447
I told him I was going to the hospital

14:16.564 --> 14:18.487
and wouldn't be picking up
the bag for a while.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.656
He said it was all right.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.154
Fuller. Detective Bureau.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.780
Yes?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.454
Does an Alan Palmer live here?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.042
Yes, my husband's at work.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.003
Well, this is just a routine check,
Mrs. Palmer.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.876
We have a license number, but we're
not absolutely sure of the accuracy of it.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.001
May I come in?

15:21.629 --> 15:24.223
- Mind if I look around a bit?
- Why?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.219
You haven't anything to hide, have you?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.769
No, I can see you haven't.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.693
What's this all about, Mr. Fuller?

15:39.814 --> 15:42.408
I told you, a routine check.
Like to look your place over.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.777
Looking for what?

15:43.901 --> 15:46.245
I didn't bring a warrant with me,
Mrs. Palmer.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.206
Maybe I should go get one.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.916
If I let you look around without one,

15:51.033 --> 15:54.583
will you promise to tell me
what it's all about?

15:54.704 --> 15:57.048
Perhaps it'll give me something
interesting to talk about

15:57.165 --> 15:58.712
at bridge tonight.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.336
Sure, Mrs. Palmer.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.509
Thanks.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.743
Leave them alone. Those are presents.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.384
So, you've already
started spending it, huh?

17:27.505 --> 17:29.849
- Spending it?
- Yes, honey, spending it.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.434
I don't think I like that.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.270
I'm sorry, but you're not making sense.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.646
If you were an innocent housewife
with nothing to hide but the iceman,

17:39.767 --> 17:41.144
you'd never let me in here.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.897
You'd be screaming for that warrant
and sending wires to your congressman,

17:44.021 --> 17:46.069
so let's cut the small talk.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.864
- Where's my dough?
- Then you're not a policeman?

17:48.985 --> 17:52.535
Only on my mother's side, honey.
Where's the dough?

17:52.655 --> 17:55.408
Those things in the kitchen
happen to belong to my sister-in-law.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.456
And I let you in because...

17:58.286 --> 18:03.258
well, housewives can get
awfully bored sometimes.

18:03.374 --> 18:07.504
But believe me, I've no idea
what you're talking about.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.391
You're too smooth, honey.
You're much too smooth.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.974
Where's the dough?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.347
- Where's that money?
- We sent it to the police.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.064
You're a liar. You would have
told me that before now.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.900
- I was afraid to.
- You should be. It was mine.

18:26.564 --> 18:30.364
Why would anyone give up
that much hard cash? I don't get it.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.203
- In fact, I don't believe it.
- It's the truth. I swear it is.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.521
And I'm supposed to get up now
and walk out? Is that it?

18:35.615 --> 18:38.118
Well, maybe I will.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.210
But if you turned that money
over to the cops, it'll be in the paper.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.329
If you didn't...

18:41.454 --> 18:43.502
It will be. We sent it back last evening.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.923
All right, I can wait a few more hours

18:47.043 --> 18:50.764
and I doubt that you or your husband
will try a copper.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.595
I'm going to buy an evening paper,

18:53.716 --> 18:57.687
and there'd better be something in it
about money or I'll be around again.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.605
And I'm afraid I'll be
awfully peeved at you, honey.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.188
Bye now.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.544
Alan, you're... you're home early.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.559
Fitzsimmons called me from the bank today.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.351
It seems as if your checks
have started coming through.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.472
He thought I might like to know

19:41.597 --> 19:44.726
that our account's down
a couple of hundred dollars.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.696
I was going to tell you tonight.
There were things I needed, Alan.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.362
Five hundred and eight dollars' worth
of necessities?

19:51.482 --> 19:53.280
That was yesterday. How much today?

19:53.401 --> 19:55.995
How much have you spent all together?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.160
Seven hundred and ninety dollars.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.830
About one tenth of one per cent
of the money we have.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.673
So, you're counting the money in the bag.

20:14.797 --> 20:19.052
We weren't going to touch it,
just leave it there and forget about it.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.429
Now you're spending it like mad
and keeping books on it.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.397
Because the money's ours.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.063
If anyone knew we had it,
they would have been around by now.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.153
I'm sending the claim check
to the district attorney's office

20:29.270 --> 20:30.522
right now, tonight.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.819
Don't I have something to say about that?

20:32.940 --> 20:34.362
I won't let you do it.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.407
I'll take the money and go off by
myself before I let you give it away.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.372
And that's something I won't
let you do. I'm in this now.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.662
If you're caught, I'm caught.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.877
But I wouldn't want you
to do it anyway, Jane.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.086
The money won't buy you anything.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.921
It'll only make you miserable and unhappy.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.040
Let me be the judge of that.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.090
Were you happy when you married Blanchard?

20:58.549 --> 21:00.927
I'm sorry, Jane. I... I didn't mean that.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.856
Jane, Jane. What's happening to us?
What's happening?

21:05.973 --> 21:09.773
The money sits down there in an old
leather bag and yet it's tearing us apart.

21:09.894 --> 21:13.819
It's poison, Jane. It's changing you.
It's changing both of us.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.283
I wish it were that simple, Alan.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.075
But I haven't changed. It's the way I am.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.413
You've got to let me keep that money.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.123
- Don't. Don't, Jane.
- No, Alan.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.538
I won't let you just give it away.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.754
Chances like this are never
offered twice. This is it.

21:28.871 --> 21:33.468
I've been waiting for it, dreaming of it
all my life, even when I was a kid,

21:33.584 --> 21:37.305
and it wasn't because we were poor,
not hungry poor, at least.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.391
I suppose in a way it was far worse.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.102
We were white-collar poor,
middle-class poor,

21:43.219 --> 21:45.062
the kind of people who can't quite
keep up with the Joneses

21:45.179 --> 21:47.432
and die a little every day
because they can't.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.354
That's why I married Blanchard.

21:49.475 --> 21:53.275
I married the first man who asked me
because I... I thought he had money.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.573
It's... it's true, Alan.

21:56.690 --> 22:01.036
And you're right, I wasn't happy.
I was almost glad when he...

22:01.153 --> 22:03.121
Jane.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.618
But things have changed now, Alan.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.130
This is different. We'll be happier
than we ever dreamed we could be.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.592
Sure we will, Jane.
But the money won't help.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.131
There'll always be Joneses
with a little more.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.756
The only thing worth having is
peace of mind,

22:19.880 --> 22:22.224
- and money can't buy that.
- But...

22:23.551 --> 22:25.974
you agreed to wait for one week.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.268
All right, we'll wait.

22:28.389 --> 22:32.019
But we're not going to keep it.
It's almost wrecked us, sweetheart.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.861
But I think it would take more
than 100 grand to do that.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.698
How about it? Hm?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.783
I got an idea.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.530
We'll go on a date. Not tonight.
I've got to see old man Barrett tonight.

22:43.654 --> 22:47.830
But tomorrow night we'll do the same
things we did on our first date. Remember?

22:47.950 --> 22:50.829
We'll have dinner at Rimoli's,
then we'll go down to the lake,

22:50.953 --> 22:53.877
and get one of those fancy little boats
and go for a ride.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.921
How about it? Is it a date?

22:56.041 --> 22:58.339
It's a date, Alan.

23:23.193 --> 23:26.618
You got a good lock.
I don't usually have so much trouble.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.865
Did you think of knocking?

23:27.990 --> 23:32.621
Yeah, but then I thought about the dull
reading I found in the newspapers.

23:32.745 --> 23:37.046
Nothing at all about a bagful of dough
turning up at police headquarters.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.215
Would you care for a drink, Mr. Fuller?

23:40.336 --> 23:43.135
You know, honey, you got quite a flair.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.054
I like you. Too bad you're a chiseler.

23:47.426 --> 23:51.932
At the risk of seeming tedious,
just where did you stash my cash?

23:56.018 --> 23:58.146
You didn't tell me
if you wanted that drink.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.193
And you didn't tell me
where you put my dough.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.033
I don't have your dough.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.494
- Let us not haggle.
- We're not going to.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.612
My husband has the money,

24:06.737 --> 24:10.162
and two days from now he's going
to turn it over to the police.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.625
You don't tell me?

24:11.742 --> 24:13.836
Nice story.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.081
Better than yesterday.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.675
I like that trick with your eyes too.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.929
I'm just taking my cue,
like a little gentleman.

24:24.046 --> 24:28.552
- You're taking it a little too fast.
- Isn't that what you wanted?

24:28.676 --> 24:31.396
Did you notice where the liquor was
when you went through my kitchen?

24:31.470 --> 24:34.690
- Sure.
- Go make us a drink.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.152
- Stalling, honey?
- What do I call you besides stupid?

24:38.268 --> 24:41.772
Ha-ha. Stupid will do,
if you don't bruise easily.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.366
Otherwise you might try Danny.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.908
If you're not stalling, get to the point.
What's on that lovely blonde mind?

24:48.028 --> 24:52.078
I told you. My husband
is going to give the money up.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.873
- I don't intend to let him give it up.
- Neither do I.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.793
I swear, if you go near him, neither
one of us will ever see a cent of it.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.666
- I'll take my chances.
- I'm telling you the truth now.

25:00.791 --> 25:04.466
You won't be able to beat it out of him
or scare it out of him.

25:04.586 --> 25:08.307
If I told him you were here yesterday
the police would have the money now.

25:08.424 --> 25:12.099
And I... I don't think
I could take it if I lost it.

25:13.762 --> 25:18.017
Let's get something straight, honey.
That's my dough you're talking about.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.270
Only half of it.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.488
You haven't a chance
of getting it without my help.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.107
And how do you get it?

25:27.568 --> 25:31.414
I don't know.
I'll work out something. I have to.

25:32.573 --> 25:36.498
When I think of losing it,
I get deathly sick inside.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.747
You know, I think
you're levelling with me.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.216
Maybe I'll string along.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.596
I'll think it over.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.104
I've thought it over.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.149
- What's your name, honey?
- Jane.

26:03.270 --> 26:08.743
One thing. When you get that dough,
I've got to be in on it. Right at the time.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.157
Otherwise, I might make
a nuisance of myself.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.497
I... I may need your help.

26:13.614 --> 26:16.709
How can I get a hold of you,
say... say about five o'clock?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.677
Call that number.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.898
For your sake, beautiful,
I hope you're not trying to soft-soap me.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.646
I wouldn't take kindly to it.

27:00.828 --> 27:01.908
What's the matter with you?

27:01.954 --> 27:05.834
That's just to remind you, honey,
you're in a tough racket now.

27:51.253 --> 27:54.177
Hello? Sadie, that you?

27:54.298 --> 27:56.517
I'll take that, Mac.

27:58.719 --> 27:59.720
Hello?

27:59.845 --> 28:02.894
Danny. It's all worked out.
We'll get it tonight.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.017
But I've got to know something first.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.985
How do I know you'll be fair with me?

28:07.102 --> 28:09.070
Listen, this is very important.
How do I know?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.774
You don't. But I'll tell you something.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.339
You've got ten times the chance
to get a straight deal from me

28:14.359 --> 28:15.360
as I've got from you.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.486
Now, what's the layout?

28:16.612 --> 28:20.492
Well, be at Westlake Park
at nine o'clock tonight.

28:20.616 --> 28:25.122
There's a big palm tree at the west end
of the lake. A palm tree. Be there.

28:25.245 --> 28:28.465
I'll come alongshore in one of those
boats and signal you with a flashlight.

28:28.582 --> 28:32.052
Be watching. I don't want to
have to do it more than once.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.762
Yes, yes. I'll have the money.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.304
Then why all the complications? Why
can't you just meet me somewhere?

28:37.424 --> 28:39.893
I don't think I like your setup.
It sounds like a snipe hunt.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.138
It's not a trap or whatever
you're thinking, Danny.

28:42.262 --> 28:47.735
I... I had to choose a place
where you'd have to play fair with me.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.195
Danny? Are you still there?

28:51.772 --> 28:54.525
Yeah. All right, I'll be there.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.403
West end of the lake
under the palm tree. Nine o'clock.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.507
Alan, let's get one of the big ones
like we used to.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.179
Them's for four people, lady.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.975
Here, lady wants one of the big ones.

30:06.096 --> 30:09.100
Like I said. Here comes one now.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.726
What's the matter, sweetie?
You seem all tied up tonight.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.020
There's nothing the matter.
I... I feel fine.

30:48.221 --> 30:53.022
Remember what we used to call
these rides? Cruises into nowhere.

30:53.143 --> 30:55.316
Seems a long time ago, doesn't it?

30:55.437 --> 30:56.984
It was.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.778
Long time ago.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.652
We haven't changed a bit, Jane. Not a bit.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.462
Alan, I... I want to go back to shore.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.673
Why, Jane? We just got started.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.213
Please, darling. I'd like to go back.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.428
Something's wrong. What is it?

31:20.754 --> 31:23.007
Maybe you're right.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.179
Maybe something is wrong.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.644
I feel... chilly.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.023
Let's go back.

31:32.140 --> 31:36.786
Alan, let's put the claim check
in an envelope and put it in the mailbox.

31:36.903 --> 31:39.350
I don't want to keep it any more.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.566
So, that's it. The money again.

31:41.691 --> 31:44.695
Look, sweetheart, let's forget it. I have.

31:44.820 --> 31:48.370
Now that we're here, let's...
let's relax and have a...

31:48.490 --> 31:52.586
Oh, doggone it! I must have left my
cigarettes at Rimoli's. Do you have a...

31:52.702 --> 31:53.954
No.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.922
What have you got in the bag?
It weighs a ton.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.599
There are no cigarettes in there, Alan.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.650
- Did you hear something then?
- Uh-uh.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.114
Stop hearing things and kiss me.

32:56.475 --> 33:00.150
You're ten minutes late. What's the id...

33:00.270 --> 33:01.271
What happened?

33:01.396 --> 33:04.696
It's Alan, my husband.
He's dead. Don't move, Danny.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.914
So, that's what I heard?
A shot, not a backfire.

33:11.031 --> 33:13.784
Yes, and I need your help.

33:13.909 --> 33:17.959
Some other time.
I don't want the money that bad.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.127
Can you take me back to shore,
or do I swim?

33:20.248 --> 33:23.502
If you move, I'll shoot you
and tell them you killed my husband.

33:25.545 --> 33:29.049
If I go along with you,
I get the gas chamber.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.847
I wonder how good a shot you are.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.470
There'll be no gas chamber
for either one of us, Danny.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.972
They saw me get on this boat
with my husband.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.144
They're going to see me get off with him.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.313
You'll be wearing his hat and coat.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.937
You've got nothing to worry about.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.281
Until his body comes floating up.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.900
We're going to see that it doesn't.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.174
You're quite a gal, Mrs. Palmer.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.286
That's for being so sweet.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.126
- Thanks. Come again.
- We intend to.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.887
This is the stuff from his pockets.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.515
Take it. I don't like frisking stiffs.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.857
- What are you going to do with it?
- Never mind. Let's go, quick.

35:04.978 --> 35:08.107
- Sure. Let's go get the dough.
- Listen, we're not in the clear yet.

35:08.231 --> 35:12.236
They've got to see you. They've got
to think Alan brought me home.

35:12.360 --> 35:17.241
I'll meet you at quarter to 12
at 6th and Beachway.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.485
Then we'll go get the money.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.243
Where?

35:20.368 --> 35:22.962
Coldwater Canyon. It's hidden there.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.299
Yeah, this afternoon you said
you'd have it in the boat with you.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.839
You're in no position to pull
another cross-up, honey.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.806
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes, I know it. Danny, please hurry.

35:45.977 --> 35:49.481
Pete, uh... Mr. Palmer would like
to have the car washed tonight.

35:49.606 --> 35:52.405
- Could you do it?
- Sure thing, Mr. Palmer.

35:56.488 --> 36:00.368
Oh, Alan! Get me some cigarettes
while you're there, will you?

36:16.257 --> 36:17.930
- Did I get you up?
- No, I was reading.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.894
I... I guess I must have dozed.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.890
Alan's gone down to the corner
to get a bottle.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.732
Why don't you come in
and have a nightcap with us?

36:24.849 --> 36:28.695
I'd love to. I was beginning to think
you were miffed with me or something.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.814
I can't see why.

36:37.112 --> 36:40.161
You mean to say Mr. Palmer
didn't come in there at all?

36:41.574 --> 36:43.918
Oh, thank you.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.662
I don't understand it.

36:45.787 --> 36:49.087
Pete says he hasn't seen him since
he drove out of here a half-hour ago,

36:49.207 --> 36:51.380
and the people at the drugstore
say he hasn't been there at all.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.627
Well, don't worry about it.

36:52.752 --> 36:55.301
Maybe he went over to the drive-in
for some hamburgers.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.470
Yes, I suppose so.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.062
I don't understand it. What could have
happened to him? It's over an hour.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.862
If nothing's happened,
why doesn't he call?

37:07.976 --> 37:10.775
I don't know, Jane.
Let me fix you a drink.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.741
Will you connect me
with police headquarters, please?

37:22.866 --> 37:24.789
Yes, it's an emergency.

37:24.909 --> 37:28.880
Hello? I'd like to check
on automobile accidents.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.499
It's my husband. He's missing and...

37:31.332 --> 37:34.962
Lady, the Missing Persons detail
closes at 5pm.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.714
You mean you can't do
anything for me tonight?

37:38.798 --> 37:41.847
How long has he been missing?

37:41.968 --> 37:44.391
Lady, we can't do anything tonight.

37:44.512 --> 37:45.980
If he doesn't show up by tomorrow,

37:46.097 --> 37:48.191
you come down here
and make a report in person

37:48.308 --> 37:50.026
and we'll go to work on it.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.861
Yes, ma'am. OK.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.529
Jane, here's your...

37:59.652 --> 38:01.370
Jane, you have a whole shelf
of whiskey out there.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.741
You told me Alan had gone to get a bottle.

38:03.865 --> 38:08.416
That's right. That proves it. He never
intended to go to the drugstore at all.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.969
There... there's something
I haven't told you, Kathy.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.885
I've known it for a long time.

38:20.006 --> 38:23.385
Alan doesn't love me anymore.
He's beginning to get tired of me.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.057
That's ridiculous and you know it.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.600
It's true, Kathy.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.941
We've been quarrelling a lot lately
about little unimportant things.

38:30.058 --> 38:33.232
I... I bought some clothes the other day
and it made him terribly angry.

38:33.353 --> 38:37.153
Please, Jane. Alan will be home soon.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.492
I think I'll go to bed now.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.658
Good night.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.831
Good night, Kathy.

39:20.942 --> 39:25.288
All right, tiger, let's have that gun you
were waving around down at the lake

39:25.405 --> 39:27.328
and I'll take it butt first.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.167
Danny, the gun was Alan's.

39:30.285 --> 39:35.257
It'd be a bit silly of me not to put it
back where it belonged, wouldn't it?

39:35.373 --> 39:37.467
And you don't have a gun either.

39:37.584 --> 39:42.181
If you did, you wouldn't be hiding it
in your pocket like that, would you?

39:53.474 --> 39:55.351
You know, tiger,

39:55.476 --> 39:59.526
I didn't know they made 'em as
beautiful as you are, and as smart...

40:00.440 --> 40:02.613
or as hard.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.736
Here.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.114
You can have the gun.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.170
Take it easy, will you?
You're not on Sunset now.

40:22.295 --> 40:26.300
I can't take a chance on being
found missing. You know that.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.518
Don't tell me you buried the dough.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.888
- What else?
- Almost anything else.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.390
Where did that money come from, Danny?

40:34.515 --> 40:36.358
Why was it being paid to you like that?

40:36.476 --> 40:39.525
I'll tell you when I see the dough, maybe.

40:53.952 --> 40:57.331
I hope you're not planning to
pull a fastie. It won't pay off.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.128
Don't quarrel with me, Danny.

40:59.248 --> 41:01.529
We're not out of trouble
until I get back to my apartment.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.136
Well, slow down
or you'll never get back. Look out!

41:13.805 --> 41:16.479
Not this time, tiger.
You didn't bury that dough and I know it.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.148
I'll see you some time when there's
daylight and a million people around.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.191
Danny! Danny, come back!

41:21.312 --> 41:22.859
The...

41:22.981 --> 41:24.949
the ticket's in that coat.

41:25.066 --> 41:27.068
Danny!

42:13.197 --> 42:16.667
- Nobody here.
- Yeah. Keys in it too.

42:16.784 --> 42:19.162
- Your feet hurt?
- You kidding?

42:19.287 --> 42:21.540
What are we waiting for?

42:42.101 --> 42:43.102
Hello.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.446
Jane, Alan's home, isn't he?

42:45.563 --> 42:48.692
- 'No.'
- But I'm sure I heard the elevator.

42:48.816 --> 42:52.741
No one came in, Kathy. It... it must
have been someone across the hall.

42:52.862 --> 42:54.910
Oh.

42:55.031 --> 42:57.659
Well, I'm sorry I disturbed you, Jane.

42:57.784 --> 42:59.752
Good night.

43:19.555 --> 43:22.229
- Who is it?
- It's Jane, Danny.

43:52.380 --> 43:56.305
Like you said, honey,
this should have been put back.

43:59.137 --> 44:02.437
What did you do with the coat?
Alan's coat.

44:02.557 --> 44:05.310
- How did you get here?
- In a cab.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.152
You know what I mean. How did you find me?

44:07.270 --> 44:10.774
I found the place where you eat.
You can guess the rest.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.320
What did you do with Alan's coat?

44:12.441 --> 44:15.866
Forget it, tiger. I took care of the coat.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.536
Let's talk about the money.
Isn't that why you're here?

44:18.656 --> 44:21.409
How? Just how did you take care of it?

44:21.534 --> 44:24.583
Don't you see? If the coat turns up
in the wrong way, we're lost.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.172
What did you do with it?

44:26.289 --> 44:31.170
Why just the coat, tiger? Why not
the hat too? It had his initials in it.

44:31.294 --> 44:34.218
Yes, and the hat too.
What did you do with them?

44:34.338 --> 44:38.013
Not a thing, angel.
I'll let you get rid of 'em.

44:38.134 --> 44:43.140
All I did was take the labels out of the
coat and the hatband out of the hat.

44:46.976 --> 44:50.446
- You want to take 'em, huh?
- Yes.

44:50.563 --> 44:51.815
Sit down, honey.

44:53.357 --> 44:55.576
Sit down, honey, on the bed.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.537
Sorry it isn't tidy.
I didn't know you were going to drop by.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.203
- Please, we haven't a minute to lose.
- I know.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.747
All I want is time to look the coat over.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.121
Time to find out
what's so special about it.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.247
Sit down, honey.

45:22.637 --> 45:25.140
There's a hole in that first pocket.

45:26.265 --> 45:30.145
Maybe there's something in the lining.
Shall we look, tiger?

45:37.360 --> 45:39.988
Yeah, what do you know?

45:41.781 --> 45:44.250
Something is in the lining, tiger.

47:13.039 --> 47:15.007
There's no one home.

47:15.124 --> 47:18.719
Well, that's hard to believe.
Could I just touch you, to make sure?

47:18.836 --> 47:21.885
I mean, were you looking
for anyone in particular?

47:22.006 --> 47:25.431
A man named Palmer.
But I can hardly remember why.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.804
Are you a friend of Mr. Palmer's?

47:27.928 --> 47:30.898
- Are you?
- Well, I asked you first.

47:31.015 --> 47:32.517
We flew together in England.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.520
In a weak moment, he asked me
to drop by if I ever got to Hollywood.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.362
Oh.

47:40.608 --> 47:42.451
I live across the hall. I'm Alan's sister.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.411
I was pretty sure you weren't Jane.

47:44.528 --> 47:48.328
- Oh, you've met Jane?
- Well, I've seen pictures of her.

47:56.248 --> 47:59.001
Mother told me there'd be times like this.

47:59.126 --> 48:01.675
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, why say anything?

48:01.796 --> 48:04.766
We could wait until they're gone
and I could just leave, maybe.

48:04.882 --> 48:07.385
- They?
- Or whoever it is we're avoiding.

48:07.510 --> 48:09.979
Jane, I gather. What's it all about?

48:17.269 --> 48:20.739
- It's Alan. He's missing.
- Missing? Since when?

48:20.856 --> 48:23.029
Last night, about ten o'clock.

48:29.865 --> 48:32.118
What did you expect to find
with your passkey?

48:32.243 --> 48:34.120
I suppose I had to expect that question.

48:34.245 --> 48:35.525
That's why I pulled you in here.

48:35.621 --> 48:38.750
I didn't want Jane to know
where you ran into me.

48:38.874 --> 48:40.126
I gathered that.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.371
I had ten days coming to me,

48:41.377 --> 48:45.348
and I looked forward to going into
a happy coma on one of your beaches.

48:45.464 --> 48:49.719
- But if there's anything I can do...
- I don't know. I just don't know.

48:49.844 --> 48:51.016
Where is Jane?

48:51.137 --> 48:55.017
She went down to the Missing Persons
bureau. She hasn't come back.

48:55.141 --> 48:59.738
Why the passkey? Why couldn't
Jane know what you were looking for?

48:59.854 --> 49:01.527
You didn't tell me your name.

49:03.149 --> 49:06.153
Ha. Don Blake.

49:06.277 --> 49:08.075
Do you know my name?

49:08.195 --> 49:12.666
Well, Alan mentioned it a few times
but I'm not quite sure. Elizabeth?

49:13.492 --> 49:15.620
No, it's Katherine.

49:17.163 --> 49:20.918
I know what you're thinking. I can
almost hear that mind of yours churning.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.965
You're wondering why I'm so eager to help.

49:24.086 --> 49:27.761
Or maybe you're wondering why I'm
so willing to believe the worst of Jane.

49:27.882 --> 49:32.137
Well, I... I never met Jane,
but I never liked her either.

49:33.179 --> 49:34.726
You know her first husband killed himself?

49:34.847 --> 49:36.315
Jane had nothing to do with it.

49:36.432 --> 49:39.106
The man had had money once
and he just couldn't stand being broke.

49:39.226 --> 49:41.524
Uh-huh.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.818
Well, anyway, getting back to Alan,

49:43.939 --> 49:46.192
you obviously think
there's something wrong.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.911
And I wouldn't like to feel
I walked out on him.

49:49.028 --> 49:52.157
So, if there's anything I can do,
or anything that ought to be done,

49:52.281 --> 49:55.125
I'd appreciate you telling me about it.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.042
All right, Mr. Blake.

50:00.164 --> 50:03.134
Better? Feel like talking now?

50:04.293 --> 50:06.512
It's cold in here.

50:06.629 --> 50:08.882
I'll turn on the oven.

50:13.344 --> 50:17.144
Maybe I shouldn't bother
to light it, huh, tiger?

50:22.311 --> 50:24.860
So, hubby pulled a cross-up, is that it?

50:26.732 --> 50:28.530
The dough is checked somewhere, I gather?

50:28.651 --> 50:29.652
Yes.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.779
Where?

50:34.698 --> 50:36.996
Is it possible to get the bag
without the ticket?

50:37.117 --> 50:38.585
I know exactly what it looks like.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.831
Sure, all you got to do
is describe the contents,

50:41.956 --> 50:45.506
then the cops come and take you away.

50:45.626 --> 50:49.631
The ticket's some place
in the apartment. I know it.

50:49.755 --> 50:51.803
I've got to get back.

50:53.050 --> 50:57.271
- And I've got to have that gun.
- Sure, I'll give you your gun.

50:57.388 --> 51:00.232
All you got to do is ask and Danny give.

51:04.853 --> 51:06.981
Remember the ride
we took last night, tiger?

51:08.691 --> 51:10.659
The money was buried up in the hill.

51:10.776 --> 51:15.077
You were taking me up there
to give me my half, remember?

51:15.197 --> 51:18.747
You were taking me up there
to kill me, tiger.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.835
You were going to kill me.

51:20.953 --> 51:23.251
And now I give you back the gun?

51:25.374 --> 51:28.253
Sure, I'll give it to you.

51:29.837 --> 51:32.010
But first I'm going to
get to know you better.

51:33.382 --> 51:36.352
I think probably some day
you will kill me.

51:37.219 --> 51:42.100
And I wouldn't want that to happen
unless we were good friends.

51:49.189 --> 51:53.239
Go ahead, scream. Get the cops
in here. That's all we need.

52:38.155 --> 52:40.078
Where have you been, Jane?
Is there any news?

52:40.199 --> 52:42.668
No.

52:42.785 --> 52:43.911
Why aren't you at work?

52:44.036 --> 52:47.290
Work? With Alan just swallowed up
someplace? Where have you been?

52:47.414 --> 52:50.258
Walking. Thinking.
Trying to figure this thing out.

52:50.376 --> 52:52.504
Jane, I thought of something this morning.

52:52.628 --> 52:55.177
If Alan just... well,
just went away, don't you...

52:55.297 --> 52:58.141
What do you mean, if he just went away?

52:58.258 --> 52:59.259
What else could have happened?

52:59.385 --> 53:03.185
I don't know.
Nothing seems to make any sense.

53:03.305 --> 53:04.807
Does it ever?

53:04.932 --> 53:09.233
I thought of a way we might
be able to tell. Alan's gun.

53:09.353 --> 53:12.698
He loved that gun. It was the only
thing he saved from his army days.

53:12.815 --> 53:13.941
If he'd known he was going away,

53:14.066 --> 53:16.910
I think he'd have taken it with him,
don't you?

53:17.027 --> 53:19.280
We can easily find out.

53:35.629 --> 53:39.007
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, I...

53:40.134 --> 53:42.762
I think I know who it is, Jane.
It's a friend of Alan's.

53:42.886 --> 53:46.060
I ran into him in the hall.
He said he'd be back.

53:55.941 --> 53:58.194
Are you Mrs. Palmer?

53:58.318 --> 54:01.322
Lieutenant Breach, Homicide Division.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.412
May I come in?

54:09.204 --> 54:11.753
You don't seem to have expected me.

54:11.874 --> 54:15.253
- Should I have?
- Well, didn't you report a...

54:15.377 --> 54:19.348
Oh, my apologies, Mrs. Palmer.
I see what's wrong now.

54:19.465 --> 54:22.218
The Missing Persons detail
is part of the Homicide Division.

54:22.342 --> 54:24.062
I've been assigned
to the case you reported.

54:24.136 --> 54:27.561
Oh, I'm afraid you frightened me
for a minute, Lieutenant.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.649
I was afraid something had happened.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.065
I'm sorry.

54:32.936 --> 54:36.406
Oh, Lieutenant Breach,
my sister-in-law, Miss Palmer.

54:36.523 --> 54:38.867
Won't you sit down?

54:38.984 --> 54:42.238
I've been trying to get you by phone,
Mrs. Palmer.

54:42.362 --> 54:46.617
I have some information for you
you might prefer to discuss privately.

54:46.742 --> 54:50.542
Miss Palmer's my husband's sister.
Go ahead.

54:50.662 --> 54:52.881
Is there anything you would like to add?

54:52.998 --> 54:55.797
Something you didn't put into your report?

54:55.918 --> 54:57.135
No, not a thing.

55:00.130 --> 55:04.260
Mrs. Palmer, there's nothing illegal
about being missing.

55:04.384 --> 55:07.012
We only work on a missing person's
case if it's a juvenile

55:07.137 --> 55:13.110
or if there's some evidence of foul
play or a suicide or an accident.

55:13.227 --> 55:16.481
When we get evidence that it is
something else, and it usually is,

55:16.605 --> 55:17.697
we don't touch it.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.283
I see.

55:19.399 --> 55:20.616
So, you see, Mrs. Palmer,

55:20.734 --> 55:25.205
it isn't exactly playing ball with us
to hold anything back.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.665
Hold what back, Lieutenant?

55:28.784 --> 55:30.502
The other woman, Mrs. Palmer.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.959
What... what do you know about her?

55:36.083 --> 55:40.634
Well, it's the only thing
we've uncovered so far.

55:40.754 --> 55:44.759
A Bel Air resident... he's vice president
of a furniture plant out in Vernon...

55:44.883 --> 55:46.726
was pulling out of his driveway
last night,

55:46.844 --> 55:51.816
when this car... uh, your car, driven
by a woman, almost crashed into him.

55:51.932 --> 55:55.857
A man dressed like you described
your husband, same size, everything,

55:55.978 --> 55:57.446
gets out of the car.

55:57.563 --> 55:59.361
Apparently, they'd had a quarrel.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.784
Well, that's about all our informant saw.

56:02.901 --> 56:05.654
All he did was spot the license number.

56:06.864 --> 56:11.665
It might have been foul play. I doubt it.
I... I suspect they patched it up.

56:13.370 --> 56:15.543
Do you know anything
about this woman, Mrs. Palmer?

56:15.664 --> 56:18.543
Not very much, I'm afraid.

56:18.667 --> 56:21.671
I... I've only seen her once or twice.

56:21.795 --> 56:25.516
She... she's a little taller than I am.

56:25.632 --> 56:28.385
Hair a little darker.

56:28.510 --> 56:30.854
Brown eyes, I think, but...

56:32.681 --> 56:34.401
I don't know her name
or where she lives.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.735
Jane, you never told me. Why?

56:36.852 --> 56:40.072
Because I didn't think it meant...

56:45.777 --> 56:47.905
Hello?

56:48.030 --> 56:50.328
Yes. It's for you.

56:50.449 --> 56:52.668
Oh, I told the Bureau I'd be here.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.043
Thank you.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.292
Hello? Yes.

57:00.459 --> 57:04.680
Uh-huh.

57:04.796 --> 57:06.890
OK. Thanks. Goodbye.

57:08.258 --> 57:10.181
I'm afraid that wraps it up.

57:10.302 --> 57:12.020
If you really want some action
on your husband, Mrs. Palmer,

57:12.137 --> 57:14.856
I'd suggest you bring in
some private help.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.396
Your car was located
12 miles south of San Diego,

57:17.517 --> 57:19.861
just this side of the Mexican border.

57:19.978 --> 57:22.606
Your husband wasn't in some kind
of trouble, was he, Mrs. Palmer?

57:22.731 --> 57:25.234
No, or... or not that I know of.

57:25.359 --> 57:27.612
Are... are you sure it was our car?

57:27.736 --> 57:31.286
Yes. I'll see that it's sent back.
Good luck.

57:31.406 --> 57:33.454
And thank you, Lieutenant.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.088
Goodbye.

57:41.792 --> 57:44.466
I know Alan wasn't seeing
another woman, and so do you.

57:44.586 --> 57:48.557
Where Alan's concerned, my dear,
you're blind. It's time you knew it.

57:48.674 --> 57:52.019
Your description of this other woman,
Jane, it sounded very much like you.

57:52.135 --> 57:55.765
What do you mean by that?
What are you trying to imply?

57:55.889 --> 57:57.687
I'm not quite sure.

57:59.685 --> 58:03.531
Well, hello again! We always seem
to be colliding in hallways, don't we?

58:03.647 --> 58:05.445
Yes, we seem to.

58:05.565 --> 58:08.239
Jane, this is the man I mentioned
to you. He flew with Alan.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.078
Mr. Blake, my sister-in-law.

58:10.195 --> 58:12.072
- How do you do, Mrs. Palmer?
- How do you do?

58:12.197 --> 58:15.576
I'm sorry to hear about Al,
but I'm sure he'll turn up soon.

58:15.701 --> 58:16.918
Thank you.

58:17.035 --> 58:19.879
Will you excuse me, Jane? Mr. Blake.

58:19.997 --> 58:25.003
Well, she seems to be a bit upset.
Has there been some news about Alan?

58:25.127 --> 58:28.131
No, but they were very close, you know.

58:28.255 --> 58:30.223
Oh, I know.

58:30.340 --> 58:33.059
Did you want to see Alan
about anything special?

58:33.176 --> 58:35.645
Oh, no, we were just very good friends.

58:35.762 --> 58:37.605
I see.

58:37.723 --> 58:40.522
- Would you like to come in?
- All right.

58:48.483 --> 58:52.784
Kathy didn't tell me much about you,
Mr. Blake. Did you know Alan well?

58:52.904 --> 58:57.410
Well, I thought I did. It'd be hard to
believe Al took after some wild geese.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.454
He was always an advocate
of the home and hearth.

58:59.494 --> 59:03.249
I... I always thought so.
Won't you sit down?

59:03.373 --> 59:05.796
All right.

59:07.627 --> 59:09.846
Uh... go ahead.

59:09.963 --> 59:11.556
Well, I was about to say
I'm here on a vacation,

59:11.673 --> 59:14.222
and I was wondering
if I might help in any way.

59:14.342 --> 59:17.972
I think the police are doing
all that can be done.

59:18.096 --> 59:20.565
What did Alan usually call you, Mr. Blake?

59:20.682 --> 59:23.151
Don. When there were ladies present.

59:24.603 --> 59:28.233
Which wasn't often, I hope.
What squadron were you flying with?

59:29.191 --> 59:31.410
The same as Alan's, Mrs. Palmer.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.949
Wouldn't you rather call me Jane?

59:34.071 --> 59:35.072
All right.

59:35.197 --> 59:38.747
- Would you like a drink?
- I didn't think it was that noticeable.

59:38.867 --> 59:41.165
- What?
- The thirsty look.

59:41.286 --> 59:44.381
Come on, let me help. Or let me watch.

59:44.498 --> 59:45.938
Where were you stationed in England?

59:47.167 --> 59:50.137
- Don't you know?
- Of course.

59:50.253 --> 59:54.008
I keep forgetting. Stonehurst
or something like that, wasn't it?

59:54.132 --> 59:57.386
Yeah, something like that. Ipswich.

59:57.511 --> 59:59.980
I didn't know we had
any operations in Stonehurst.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:04.022
Well, all those places in England
used to sound alike to me.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:17.365
I seem to worry you, Mrs. Palmer. Why?

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:18.706
Why do you say that?

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:23.921
I don't know. I... I sense a third-degree
quality in this conversation.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.631
Could I be wrong?

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:30.753
Yes, you're wrong.
I'm just curious about you, Mr. Blake.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.964
No, you don't worry me.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.389
But it's possible
you're beginning to intrigue me.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:42.731
Oh, let's wait till we're sure
Al isn't coming back, hm?

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.208
You made quite a bit out of
that remark of mine, didn't you?

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:48.104
Well, I didn't think I made any more
out of it than I found there.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.565
I'm afraid you did.

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:55.695
If I should hear from Alan,
where can he get in touch with you?

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.698
I'm staying at the Villa Vista Hotel.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.620
Oh, by the way, uh... on my way out,

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.664
shall I take the guy in the plaid suit
off your back?

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:04.877
What did you say?

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.498
Looks a little pale.
I think I can handle him all right.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:11.217
- What are you talking about?
- The guy in the plaid suit.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:12.631
He was lurking around
the dark end of the hall,

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.050
making like a tenant trying to find a key.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:18.301
I watched him for a while as I got
off the elevator. Made him nervous.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:21.224
He must be from the police.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.721
Sure.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.770
That's right. They're looking for Al.

01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:29.361
They probably figure the best place
to find him is where he lives.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.618
Thanks for the drink...

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.787
Mrs. Palmer.

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.711
Sharber.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:53.005
Sharber.

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:58.511
Hello, Mr. Jack Sharber, please.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:03.263
Mr. Sharber, this is Jane Palmer,
Alan's wife. Yes, I'm fine.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.731
Mr. Sharber, you were at Ipswich
with Alan, weren't you?

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:09.567
Do you remember a Don Blake?

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.607
No, Blake.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:15.358
You don't? Mr. Sharber,
could you drop by here tonight?

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:18.076
It would only have to be
for a minute or so.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.910
Could you come by tomorrow, then?

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:31.006
All right, fine. It's the Chateau Michel,
apartment 514.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.920
Thank you, Mr. Sharber.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:36.090
Tomorrow night, then.
Seven o'clock. Goodbye.

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:40.882
You stupid fool. You were seen out there.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.884
For all I know, the man
who saw you was a detective.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:46.513
Relax, tiger. There are other people
on this floor, you know.

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:48.857
What do you want?

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:51.022
- Find the ticket?
- No.

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:55.864
Too bad. I don't like to think
what'll happen inside you if you don't.

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:57.824
I came up to tell you something, tiger.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.787
If you get that dough and dust with it,
it'll be very, very bad.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.450
- I don't intend to.
- Fine.

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:06.074
But let me tell you why
it'll be very, very bad.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.826
You want to know about that, don't you?

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.625
Listen, Danny, we can't be
fighting each other now.

01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:13.999
- We've got to help each other.
- Yeah? Why?

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.502
Kathy, my sister-in-law,
she's getting suspicious.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.426
She's beginning to figure
the whole thing out.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.089
- How? What's she got?
- She heard me come in last night.

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:23.342
I denied it, but I know
she doesn't believe me.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.718
She knows Alan wouldn't
have gone out to get liquor,

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:26.140
because there was plenty here.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:29.435
She knows Alan's gun was gone.
I don't know how, but she does.

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:32.526
She... she's going to trip us up,
Danny, I know it.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.940
Maybe it's time to clear out.
Chalk it up to experience.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:38.190
We can't. We've got to stay here
until we find that ticket.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.240
You mean stay here till she tells
her story to the cops? Is that it?

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.658
She's not going to tell her story.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:48.037
You're going to help me again, Danny.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.791
Help you do what?

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:59.715
You've got no other choice.
We can't just wait and let her kill us.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:03.886
I didn't mean to kill Alan, but it's done
and now it's our lives against hers.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:07.102
We kill her, huh? Do you really think
you can get away with that?

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.266
Yes.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:12.357
Kathy was all wrapped up in Alan.
She missed work today.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:15.148
She's what the papers
would call despondent.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:19.239
She... she's going to take poison
because of it.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.404
You're going to get it for me.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.153
Sorry, Mrs. Palmer.
I'd rather take my chances.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:28.873
You don't think I want to do it?
I couldn't kill Alan.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.793
I tried to convince myself I could kill him,
but when the time came, I couldn't do it.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.287
How did he die? Pneumonia?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.210
It was an accident. He opened
my purse and the gun fell out.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:37.851
I don't know what happened after that.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.881
I killed him. But I didn't know it then
and I'm not going to die for it.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:44.427
We've got to do it, Danny.
We've got no other choice.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.718
Get me something, Danny.

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:51.722
You know how to get it. I'll do the rest.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:54.065
We can't put it off.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:56.310
You are a tiger.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.937
You got me in so deep, I can't get out.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.531
I'll get the stuff for you. But,
like you say, you gotta do the rest.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.525
Every bit of it.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.152
When I get back,
make sure she's not around.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.244
I don't want to see her,
not even for a second,

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.456
and I don't want to talk
about this or her again.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.166
I'll... I'll get you some money.

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:22.028
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:27.943
- How did you make out with Jane?
- She's crazy about me.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:30.490
You know where they went last night,
before Alan disappeared?

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:32.330
Yes.

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.767
Do you happen to have any pictures
around of Jane and Alan?

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:35.908
Why, yes. Why?

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.913
Well, the police won't do anything until
they're convinced something's wrong.

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:41.335
We're going to find something
to convince them.

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:43.584
How did you know that
about the police? Did Jane...

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:47.508
Get into your coat, Miss Palmer,
honey. We're going sleuthing.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.067
You waiting for a boat, mister?

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:04.063
Well, not right now. But I would like
to ask you a couple questions.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.987
Look, I don't know
what makes 'em run, mister.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.740
I ain't no good with motors.

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:12.112
Well, maybe you're good at faces.
Remember the last time you saw him?

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:17.417
Yeah, I seen him.
But I'll be darned if I remember when.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:18.706
Maybe this'll help.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.088
Yeah, last night.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.333
They was here last night.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.551
Hey, you a cop?

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:29.922
- Do I look like one?
- I never seen any that did.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:35.098
I just happen to be a friend of his
and he, uh... disappeared last night.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.391
Do you remember anything
about them, how they behaved?

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:38.684
Or if they were quarrelling or anything?

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.558
Uh... they acted like any corny people.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:55.997
There you are, buddy. Thanks very much.

01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:58.274
Are you sure there isn't
anything else you can tell us?

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.752
They were pretty fast with a buck, too.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:04.664
He give me one to get one of the big
boats, and when they came back, she...

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:07.918
You know, I just thought of something.
She paid.

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:10.136
He helped her out of the boat,
real polite like,

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:12.756
and he goes upstairs,
and she goes over there and pays.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.305
- Hmph! Some guy.
- Well, they're married, you know.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:18.804
Oh, that explains everything.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:19.929
Thanks.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:23.270
You know, uh... the man
usually pays for things,

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.359
even when he's married to the girl.

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:28.194
Uh... did Alan happen to be
an exception to that rule?

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:31.533
He is rather absent-minded.
You must have noticed that.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.698
Oh, sure. Sure, that's right.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.624
Well, I think we'd better
say goodnight here.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:46.715
I think it's better if Jane doesn't
see us together too much.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:49.084
All right.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:53.337
Well, I sort of made saying goodnight
sound like quite a project, didn't I?

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.511
Yes, I thought so.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.265
Oh, ten days in town.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:06.193
I don't think you'd go
for that kind of a deal, would you?

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.528
I might.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.068
But I see what you mean.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:17.988
Good night, Miss Palmer, honey.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.032
Did you really fly with Alan?

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.167
Hey, what kind of a question is that?

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:28.756
An honest one.
I hope you'll give me an honest answer.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:32.423
You seem so terribly concerned
about what happened to Alan,

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:34.863
yet you never talk about him
as though you really knew him.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:40.305
Well, uh... maybe there's a reason, Kate.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:46.020
Maybe I'm afraid if I did, I'd be
talking about him in the past tense.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.268
What makes you say that?

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:50.816
Oh, I don't know.

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:53.359
Just a peculiar feeling I've had.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.860
About Jane.

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:59.828
Now, look, let's get squared away
on her first.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:03.246
And then I'll talk about myself
till you cry uncle.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.039
You know, I'm one of my favorite topics.

01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:07.708
All right, Don. Goodnight.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:10.423
Oh, wait, wait. Just one other thing.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:15.091
There's something going on here,
Kathy, and it's not very pretty.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.805
Don't ask me what it is or why I think so,

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.471
but...

01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:22.218
bear with me, Kate, will you?

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.305
I have to trust someone, Don.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.354
I'd like it to be you.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.859
Goodnight, Don.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.952
Goodnight, Kathy.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.231
Who is it?

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:21.406
You really want me to answer that?
Right out here in front of...

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:28.251
- You're drunk.
- It takes one to spot one.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:36.417
Did you get it?

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:41.218
The best, Duchess.
Nothing but the best for you, Duchess.

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:44.058
I say let's kill these people in style.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:49.434
There's enough there to kill
most of the people you don't like.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:53.731
Now, let me hold that little bottle
while you go fix me a drink.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.524
You'd had enough to drink.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:59.366
Get out of here and get yourself sober.
I don't like you this way.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:02.611
You know what the man said
who sold me this?

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:07.457
He said I didn't look like the type
of guy he was used to dealing with.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.996
I looked him right in the eye

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:13.712
and I said, "You mean
I don't look like a killer, huh?"

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.958
You know what he said?

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.726
He said, "No, you don't."

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:28.429
I wonder what he would have said
if you'd bought the stuff, tiger.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.601
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:21.323
Well! How did you know I was
going to ask you out to dinner?

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:22.565
I didn't.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.658
- Then why do you look so nice?
- Well, thank you, sir.

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.528
But I just got home from work.
I look a fright and you know it.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.748
Oh, sure you do.
I know just the best place for us.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:32.993
All the best frights go there.

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:34.960
And I was going to settle
for a glass of milk.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:39.002
Oh, no, it'll keep. You go ahead.
I'll put it in the refrigerator.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:10.117
Don, after dinner, I'd like you
to take me down to Union Station.

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:12.535
Kind of sudden, isn't it?
Plan to be gone long?

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:15.786
I found... I found this yesterday.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:19.631
It was hidden in the drawer
where Alan keeps his gun.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:23.547
What do you mean, after dinner?
Maybe this is the answer?

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:28.555
Oh, I... I was just about to knock.

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.095
What did you want, Jane?

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:33.015
As a matter of fact, I... I wanted
to get hold of you, Mr. Blake.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:38.062
There's someone in my apartment I'd
like you to meet, a man named Sharber.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.698
Well, maybe some other time, Mrs. Palmer.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:44.272
There won't be another time.
I'm leaving tomorrow, perhaps sooner.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.570
- Jane, did you hear from Alan?
- No.

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:48.864
They brought the car back today.

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:52.364
I... I found a note in it from Alan.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.957
He's somewhere in Mexico
and I intend to find him.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.621
May I see it? What did he say?

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.495
It... it was rather personal, Kathy.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.043
He... he asked me to forgive him...

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.135
told me I could do whatever I wanted
with his things.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.175
- That's all?
- That's all.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.974
Won't you come, Mr. Blake?
It's only for a minute.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.978
All right.

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.500
You two don't seem to know each other.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:38.617
Should we?

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:41.872
Mr. Sharber, this is Don Blake.

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:45.921
He was stationed with you and Alan
at Ipswich, he says.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:48.795
Ha! I say that to all the girls.
Let's go, Kate.

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:51.718
You never flew at Ipswich, Jack.
What are you trying to pull?

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.638
Not a thing, Mac.

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:56.682
I'm leaving, Kathy. I'd like to
have you come along with me.

01:15:56.802 --> 01:16:01.148
No, and I'd like
what I gave you a minute ago.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.609
Well, let's talk about it outside.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:06.229
I... I've already kept you too long,
Mr. Sharber.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:09.323
I found out what I wanted to know.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.657
You sure you're all right?

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.403
Quite all right. Good night, Mr. Sharber.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:16.656
- Good night.
- Thank you.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.880
And now I'll take that ticket, please.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.046
The ticket belongs to me, Mr. Blake.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:31.546
If I have to shoot you to get it,
I'll be quite within my rights.

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.764
I'm afraid you won't be.

01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:36.767
You can have the ticket.

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:40.855
All you have to do is reach
into my pocket and take it.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:55.694
Turn around.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:08.216
Get me the Hollywood police, quick.
It's an emergency.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:10.012
Hello, I'm calling
from the Chateau Michel.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:12.886
You've got to send
someone up here quickly.

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:15.097
514. Hurry.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.558
Katherine Palmer. Hurry.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:54.386
Dr. Adams? Katherine Palmer.
Could you come up to 514 right away?

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:02.182
Hollywood police. Emergency.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:03.896
This is Katherine Palmer again.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.687
You've got to send a patrol car
to Union Station.

01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:09.026
A woman will try to claim something there.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:17.069
'The Union Pacific City of Los Angeles
train 103 is now arriving.

01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:31.502
'The Los Angeles Terminal.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:35.595
'Union Pacific train number 1
is now arriving.'

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:53.021
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.192
You by yourself?

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.907
Not any more, if I can help it.
How would you like to go...

01:18:57.024 --> 01:19:00.153
How would you like to do a lady
a big favor and earn five dollars?

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:02.075
What kind of a favor?

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:05.450
My... my ex-boyfriend's over there,
waiting for me to claim my bag.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.793
If you get it for me, I can avoid him.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:11.960
If you like, I'll let you spend
the five dollars on me.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.209
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:11.228
- Here I am.
- I'll, uh... take my fin now, lady.

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:13.771
- What?
- My five bucks.

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:15.940
All right.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:43.927
Ooh. Ooph.

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:49.470
- How long have I been out?
- You took quite a jolt.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:54.980
Kathy, did you send the police
down to the Union Station?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.101
I tried to. They wouldn't go.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:59.776
They said they couldn't hold anyone
unless there was a crime committed.

01:20:59.897 --> 01:21:02.241
Isn't cracking skulls a crime?

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.702
Don't look at me.
I just drive a patrol car.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:07.162
Do you want to file charges
against somebody?

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:11.747
Can you get an address from
a license number, this time of night?

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.039
Sure we can.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.663
You got a homicide man
at the Hollywood station?

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.836
They didn't kill you. You'll live.

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:19.458
Come on, let's go.

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:22.132
Am I coming? I seem to recall
we had a date for dinner.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:26.257
We did, but I guess you'll have to
settle for that milk after all, Kathy.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.181
Could I have two minutes before you go?

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:31.804
We can cover it in ten seconds.

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:36.025
You were right, Kathy.
I don't know your brother from Adam.

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:41.113
Now, I could expand on that, but I think
Janey still has some unfinished business.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.278
Thanks, Doc.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:31.534
I found the ticket, Danny. I've found it.
It's all clear sailing now.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:33.874
Go away. Creep back out.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:36.710
Lock the door, Danny. Pull the blinds.

01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:01.481
What's the matter?

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:04.071
I'm worried. I don't get it.

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:07.192
The money's in that bag, Danny.
We're leaving for Mexico with it.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.741
Like I say, I don't get it. Why we?

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:14.911
I need you. A woman travelling alone
would attract too much attention.

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:18.161
And I've got to know about that
money, where it came from.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:22.006
That's better. Don't ever change, tiger.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.716
I don't think I'd like you with a heart.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.551
Open the bag, Danny.

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:43.644
It's all ours.

01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:47.655
- Let's have a drink.
- In a minute, Danny.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:50.133
But first of all, I've got to know
where the money came from

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.160
and if we can use it safely.

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.575
There should be 60 grand in there, tiger.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.745
60 grand. I got to have a drink.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:01.120
Wait, Danny. Somebody threw
that money into our car. Why?

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:06.588
Because you don't go into a guy's
office in a blackmail payoff, sweet.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.008
Besides, he didn't know what I look
like and I wanted to keep it that way.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:13.632
- But... but who is it and why did...
- Never mind who it is, tiger.

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:17.682
But it's the kind of a thing you come
across only once in a lifetime.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:20.022
I stumbled onto a racket.

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.140
A big man in town.

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:24.860
Three floors of mahogany
in the Monarch Building.

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:30.700
Big insurance agent. Sells policies
on bridges and aqueducts and stuff.

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:34.241
Whoever heard of anything
happening to a bridge?

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:36.830
So, the policies never went back
to New York.

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:38.369
They're just pieces of paper

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:42.336
my benefactor's been collecting
premiums on for years.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.873
I cut me a slice of last year's premiums.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.087
That's it.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.757
Then...

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:53.426
then the money isn't marked.
We can spend it.

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:55.845
You said it, tiger.

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:57.764
Now...

01:24:57.884 --> 01:25:00.103
let's have that drink.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:04.191
Wait, Danny. We'll make it a toast.
I'll get some glasses.

01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:06.731
They're right there on the sink.

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:28.420
Here's to crime. It pays and pays.

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:13.483
Found this in his pocket. Take a sniff.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:15.780
The whiskey bottle wasn't spiked.

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.946
He took it like a good boy,
right in his glass.

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:22.992
Go out and call the lab crew and the
meat wagon. Tell them it's a suicide.

01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:28.244
It's no suicide. Your friend Mrs. Palmer
arranged this little tableau.

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:32.248
- Any idea why?
- Yeah. He helped her kill her husband.

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:35.291
If you've got something to tell me,
let's have it.

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:39.628
I think you'll find her husband at the
bottom of the lake at Westlake Park.

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:42.052
Ha-ha. You don't say?

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:44.142
You know, I'm only a cop.

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:47.354
When I checked the lake, I found they
went there the night he disappeared

01:27:47.471 --> 01:27:49.098
and they also left it together.

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:52.772
Now, look, when they left the boat,
Palmer was in a great big hurry.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:55.237
He left the paying to his wife
and dashed up the steps,

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:57.276
and now I think I know why.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:28:01.243
Palmer never got off that boat.
This guy did.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.737
Then he drove Palmer's car to San Diego.

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:07.207
I could point out a dozen things
wrong with that, but why bother?

01:28:07.324 --> 01:28:09.484
If you're right, the body
will come up in a day or two.

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:13.289
Oh, no. I'm afraid
you'll have to drag the lake.

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:18.385
Jane's a pretty smart girl. If she put
him there, she put him there to stay.

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:22.052
Anyone besides you ever see them together?

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:24.971
Look, what's the trouble?
Don't you want to lick this thing?

01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:28.478
Do you know what it would cost the
department to close that lake and drag it?

01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:30.597
We'd have to get an OK
from the Police Commission,

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:32.975
and the Bureau of Budget and Efficiency,

01:28:33.099 --> 01:28:35.022
and if the lake management
raised enough of a hassle,

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.111
we might even have to go
to the City Council.

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:39.527
Hey, Chief. Come here a minute.

01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:43.235
- What's the idea? I haven't done...
- All right, all right.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.613
She starts up the walk
and notices the door's open.

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.831
Then she sees our car
and decides to go away.

01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:50.167
I was just trying to ask her
a polite question.

01:28:50.283 --> 01:28:52.251
Polite, he says. How does he act
when he's being crude?

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:54.463
Are you a friend of Fuller's?

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:58.254
- Friend of whose?
- Come on inside.

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:05.215
What happened?

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.684
Did you ever see this before?

01:29:10.387 --> 01:29:12.515
Was it with that?

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:16.314
You know anyone
who would want to kill him?

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:18.653
He killed himself.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.613
Oh, God have mercy on him.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:24.655
What makes you think he did it
himself? You got any reason?

01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:28.163
He had a big deal on.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.617
50 or 60 grand, he said.

01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:34.244
But something went wrong.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:36.792
I was with him when he got that stuff.

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:39.666
He didn't think I knew
what he was getting, but I did.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.168
Oh, I want to go home.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:45.506
Parker, take her home, get her name,
and find out where Fuller got that poison.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:47.473
Right.

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:55.766
And as for you, brother, I'm going to
let you off with a little friendly advice.

01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:58.895
Don't ever try to involve the
department in your private quarrels.

01:29:59.019 --> 01:30:00.942
If you get any facts, bring them around.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.690
But until you do, Palmer's a missing
person and this guy killed himself.

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:05.408
Now get going.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:07.619
Palmer's a corpse.

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:11.957
How much would it cost me to have
the lake dragged and prove it to you?

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:17.330
What did the lady do to you,
Blake, besides sap you down?

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:20.128
It must have been something big.

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:25.845
Sure, son, you can drag the lake.

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:28.761
A guy did it about four years ago,
looking for his wife.

01:30:28.882 --> 01:30:31.002
When he'd got through it,
it had cost him 4,000 bucks,

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:32.803
the park officials were suing him,

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:35.807
and his wife turned up in Modesto
with a truck driver.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.262
Having trouble?

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:55.226
All fixed now, thanks. Had a flat.

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:57.766
- Sure I can't help any?
- No, no. Thanks very much.

01:31:57.887 --> 01:32:01.536
It's a bad place to get stuck.
Blowout, huh?

01:32:01.707 --> 01:32:03.334
Yes.

01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:06.905
This small fortune belong to you, ma'am?

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:09.946
Yes, it... it must have
dropped from my bag.

01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:14.162
Suppose there's any more
where that came from?

01:32:25.665 --> 01:32:29.636
All that money, lady, you ought
to have some male protection.

01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:35.846
Anything wrong, miss?

01:32:35.967 --> 01:32:39.847
No, I... I had a flat,
but everything's all right now.

01:33:36.694 --> 01:33:39.743
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:42.583
Goodnight. It was so nice meeting you.

01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:48.673
After dinner, we'll go to the frontón
for the highlight game.

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:51.134
I'm sorry, Carlos. No.

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:55.217
- I'm rather tired.
- Of course.

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:58.968
Mañana.

01:35:05.825 --> 01:35:08.749
Well, nice place you have here,
Mrs. Palmer.

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:12.295
Oh, excuse me.
It's Miss Petrie now, isn't it?

01:35:12.415 --> 01:35:15.840
That happens to be my maiden name.
I filed suit for divorce.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.137
That's a nice touch, but, uh... widows
don't need divorces, do they?

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:23.635
I wasn't aware that I was a widow.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.140
Doesn't matter. I really came here
to talk about money.

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:32.652
I'd like, say, half of what
you brought down with you.

01:35:33.978 --> 01:35:39.485
That would be about 200 dollars, Mr...
What was your name?

01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:41.577
It was Blake when you knew me.

01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:45.369
You brought down about 60 grand,
according to Danny's girlfriend.

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:47.584
I don't know any Danny and...

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:51.421
I haven't got any money.

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:57.377
I think you'd better leave.

01:36:00.004 --> 01:36:02.604
I swear I'll scream to wake the dead
if you don't get out of here.

01:36:02.674 --> 01:36:07.020
Well, it's too bad you can't wake
the dead, Jane. It might save you.

01:36:07.136 --> 01:36:10.185
You see, I found your husband's body.

01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:15.691
I told the Los Angeles police where I am.

01:36:15.812 --> 01:36:19.112
If there was any news of Alan,
I would have been notified.

01:36:19.232 --> 01:36:23.738
Not about this, you wouldn't.
You see, I let him drop back in.

01:36:25.488 --> 01:36:28.162
Drop back? Where?

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:30.502
Where you put him, the lake.

01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:36.507
Looking for something?

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:39.127
- My lipstick.
- Colt? Or Smith & Wesson?

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:43.764
Now...

01:36:44.966 --> 01:36:46.639
what's this about lakes?

01:36:46.759 --> 01:36:48.727
Just one lake.

01:36:48.845 --> 01:36:51.445
And if we can't make a deal, I'm going
back and drag him up again.

01:36:53.349 --> 01:36:55.852
How... how much do you want?

01:36:55.977 --> 01:36:57.775
I told you, half.

01:36:59.439 --> 01:37:01.239
It's in the hotel safe.
I'd have to go get it.

01:37:01.357 --> 01:37:02.358
Go ahead.

01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:07.739
Aren't you afraid I might not come back?

01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:08.911
You'll come back.

01:37:09.032 --> 01:37:11.160
How do I know you won't take it all?

01:37:11.284 --> 01:37:14.458
Well, that would make me a cad,
Jane. I couldn't do that.

01:37:14.579 --> 01:37:16.957
Get the money.
I'll be satisfied with half.

01:37:44.067 --> 01:37:46.536
Has a nice cool look, hasn't it, Jane?

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:49.951
It tempts me.

01:37:50.823 --> 01:37:53.451
- But this'll cover it.
- What do you mean by that?

01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:57.251
I'm giving you a strict accounting
of your funds, Mrs. Palmer.

01:37:57.372 --> 01:37:59.670
I had to know for sure
if your husband was really in that lake.

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:02.920
This is a price
for having the lake dragged.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:04.546
What do you mean?
What are you trying to say?

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:06.889
I'm trying to tell you, Jane,
you're all washed up.

01:38:07.006 --> 01:38:09.008
You can't take my money, and...

01:38:11.094 --> 01:38:12.596
- You're not...
- The law?

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:17.146
No. No, just someone who couldn't
let you get away with it, Jane.

01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:18.267
A killjoy.

01:38:21.979 --> 01:38:24.778
Here it is. You want it, don't you?

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.863
It's yours! All you have to do is take it!

01:38:29.987 --> 01:38:32.661
You can't see it, Mrs. Palmer,
but I'm riding a big white horse.

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:34.705
This is a vendetta.

01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:36.874
But it's over now.

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:38.996
Please page Teniente Rivera.
He's in the lobby.

01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:43.752
Rivera, I'm in her apartment.
She has the money here. All of it.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:46.004
Yes, right away.

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:48.131
You'll have to forgive me, Jane,

01:38:48.256 --> 01:38:51.135
but I made formal charges that
you stole that money from me.

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:52.602
Now, you can sue me later
for false arrest,

01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:56.097
but I had to figure some way of keeping you
in town until the LA police get here.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:59.692
- Why, Mr. Blake? Tell me why!
- Not Blake. Blanchard.

01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:03.359
- Does it mean anything to you?
- I...

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:06.358
I once married a man named Blanchard.

01:39:06.482 --> 01:39:08.280
Yes, my brother.

01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:11.905
I was overseas when it happened, but I
never really believed Bob killed himself.

01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:14.407
- You killed him.
- I swear I didn't kill him.

01:39:14.532 --> 01:39:15.909
He found out I didn't love him,
and he killed himself.

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:17.956
I swear it. I swear I didn't kill him!

01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:20.171
There are many ways
of killing a man, Jane.

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:25.465
And now that I know you, I can
believe Bob probably did kill himself.

01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:29.635
But then there's Alan Palmer
and your friend Danny.

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:32.474
You're all through killing now, Jane.

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:39.975
Wait! He's lying! The money is mine!

01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:42.818
Please, señorita, we wish no trouble.
You come with us, eh?

01:39:42.935 --> 01:39:44.937
No! I tell you he's lying!

01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:47.823
Jane!

01:39:57.325 --> 01:39:59.544
- Someone get a doctor.
- No need. She's dead.

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:02.880
- How did it happen?
- She fell from the balcony.

01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:07.294
Vamos, muchachos.

01:40:32.068 --> 01:40:35.163
Well, it was a short honeymoon, Kathy.

01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:39.033
We're going home now.

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:42.378
Jane?

01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:44.418
Yeah.
