WEBVTT

00:00.235 --> 00:01.484
<i>Previously on Heartland:</i>

00:01.520 --> 00:02.620
Wait a second,
are you...

00:02.687 --> 00:04.955
Are you asking me
to give you Phoenix?

00:04.991 --> 00:06.825
Just for the rest
of the season.

00:06.859 --> 00:08.025
And why would I do that?

00:08.058 --> 00:09.026
'Cause if you do

00:09.060 --> 00:10.494
I'll cancel
Buckingham's surgery,

00:10.561 --> 00:12.029
and retire him
just like you said I should.

00:12.063 --> 00:13.864
- Who's Jeremy?
- My so-called coach!

00:13.932 --> 00:16.100
And the whole time,
he was just using me!

00:16.134 --> 00:18.202
(Hooves thunder)

00:18.270 --> 00:19.536
(Spartan squeals)

00:20.471 --> 00:22.106
Amy:
You think his leg's broken?

00:22.140 --> 00:24.207
<i>So I have just one question:</i>

00:24.275 --> 00:26.075
What would you do
if he was your horse?

00:26.143 --> 00:28.278
I'd take the risk.
I'd do the surgery.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.980
Then let's do it.

00:31.015 --> 00:32.048
Okay.

00:36.220 --> 00:37.954
So how's Spartan doing?

00:37.988 --> 00:39.289
Good.

00:39.323 --> 00:41.623
The last X-ray showed that
his pastern's healing well.

00:46.329 --> 00:48.330
Any signs of laminitis?

00:48.364 --> 00:50.365
So far so good.
Amy's been keeping him moving

00:50.433 --> 00:52.201
so he doesn't put all his weight
on his good leg.

00:52.268 --> 00:53.902
Oh, she's done some good
with him,

00:53.970 --> 00:54.903
it's really helped.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.503
So when can
we release him?

00:56.571 --> 00:57.932
Well, it's still
too early to tell,

00:57.940 --> 00:59.061
but the way things
are going,

00:59.074 --> 01:01.775
I'd say sometime
next week.

01:03.778 --> 01:05.813
So, who do we have here?

01:05.881 --> 01:08.415
This is Taboo,
a six-year-old mare.

01:08.450 --> 01:10.218
Belongs to Darcy Langois
up at Triple B.

01:10.285 --> 01:12.452
She's in for A.I.
It's her third foal.

01:12.519 --> 01:14.721
I've got her penciled in
for five o'clock.

01:14.788 --> 01:17.123
Okay, well I better hit the road
if I wanna be back by then.

01:17.191 --> 01:19.792
Okay.
Oh, Scott!

01:19.861 --> 01:21.101
Is there another
admission here?

01:21.128 --> 01:22.929
I don't have
anymore paperwork.

01:22.997 --> 01:26.330
Yeah, actually,
it's Buckingham.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.901
Buckingham?
Jeremy's horse?

01:28.969 --> 01:32.302
He'll be bringing him by
sometime this afternoon.

01:35.475 --> 01:36.742
What for?!

01:37.643 --> 01:39.945
Lou: All right, honey,
do you want some yogurt?

01:40.013 --> 01:43.346
We'll have a snack as soon
as mommy's done the dishes.

01:43.683 --> 01:45.216
Jack:
Hello, honey!

01:45.284 --> 01:46.417
Oh, hi, Grampa.

01:46.485 --> 01:48.119
Are you waiting for me?

01:48.187 --> 01:50.521
Lou:
I, uh, made you some coffee.

01:50.589 --> 01:52.156
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:52.224 --> 01:53.992
Lou, do you have any idea

01:54.026 --> 01:55.894
<i>when Caleb's planning</i>
<i>to be back?</i>

01:55.928 --> 01:58.096
He said something about a rodeo
in Medicine Hat

01:58.130 --> 01:59.430
<i>and Lethbridge.</i>

01:59.464 --> 02:02.499
Oh well, I suppose
we can't hold that against him.

02:02.566 --> 02:03.767
<i>But at my age,</i>

02:03.801 --> 02:06.503
running a ranch
isn't exactly a one-man job.

02:06.537 --> 02:08.005
Tell me about it!

02:08.038 --> 02:10.374
I guess I could use an extra
set of hands around here too.

02:10.407 --> 02:11.641
<i>Remind me next time,</i>

02:11.675 --> 02:13.377
<i>if you want a rodeo cowboy</i>
<i>to stick around,</i>

02:13.411 --> 02:15.112
don't buy him new tires.

02:15.146 --> 02:16.879
(Lou and Jack laugh)

02:17.814 --> 02:18.881
There we go.

02:24.621 --> 02:25.587
(Spartan snorts)

02:25.622 --> 02:26.822
Hey, Amy.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.824
Hey!

02:28.858 --> 02:29.959
What's wrong?

02:31.761 --> 02:33.161
Ty...?

02:35.697 --> 02:36.818
I just found out
this morning

02:36.832 --> 02:37.999
that Jeremy's bringing
his horse in

02:38.034 --> 02:40.868
to get him de-nerved
first thing tomorrow.

02:40.903 --> 02:44.105
Are you serious?
He knows the risks!

02:44.140 --> 02:46.074
Well, Scott says it happens
all the time.

02:46.108 --> 02:47.342
You invest a lot
of time and money

02:47.376 --> 02:48.542
in a high-end
performance horse,

02:48.576 --> 02:51.478
and it's hard to pull
the plug on his career.

02:51.512 --> 02:54.315
Well, I think you can use
a couple hours away from me.

02:54.349 --> 02:55.549
Hmm?

02:55.583 --> 02:57.751
Ty:
No, Amy, come on!

02:57.785 --> 02:58.885
Come on!

02:58.920 --> 03:01.956
I've gotta at least talk to him,
okay?

03:01.990 --> 03:03.123
(Sighs)

03:05.392 --> 03:08.694
Yeah...
I guess you do.

03:09.629 --> 03:11.097
(Spartan nickers)

03:13.767 --> 03:14.733
Oh, Lou!

03:14.768 --> 03:17.003
Hey, Georgie!
How was school?

03:17.037 --> 03:19.738
Georgie: Great! And we're
getting recorders!

03:19.806 --> 03:20.872
Cool!

03:20.906 --> 03:23.775
All you have to do
is fill this out.

03:24.710 --> 03:26.411
And pay twenty dollars.

03:26.446 --> 03:28.126
Georgie: Yup, twenty bucks.
Isn't it great?

03:28.147 --> 03:30.949
It's like they're
giving them away!

03:32.885 --> 03:33.952
(Laughs incredulously)

03:35.154 --> 03:36.454
(Truck rumbles)

03:42.060 --> 03:43.260
(Door slams)

03:46.898 --> 03:48.265
(Knocking)

03:51.370 --> 03:53.470
Hey, Nancy Drew!

03:53.537 --> 03:55.171
You know, I figured
you'd be stopping by

03:55.206 --> 03:56.473
sooner or later.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.840
Here, come on in.

04:00.478 --> 04:01.444
Okay.

04:03.147 --> 04:05.648
Uh, Cassandra told me
Spartan's doing really well.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.283
I'm glad to hear it.

04:07.351 --> 04:09.818
I think you know why
I'm here, Jeremy.

04:09.886 --> 04:11.286
I wanna talk
about Buckingham.

04:11.354 --> 04:12.354
I'm sorry, but...

04:12.422 --> 04:14.256
I've already made
my decision, so...

04:14.324 --> 04:15.924
There's nothing else
to say, really.

04:15.992 --> 04:18.327
You were looking
for alternatives.

04:18.394 --> 04:19.755
You even talked about
retiring him.

04:19.762 --> 04:21.663
What changed your mind?

04:21.731 --> 04:23.098
Okay.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.900
Yeah.
Yeah, um...

04:25.967 --> 04:28.769
Fair question, yeah.

04:28.837 --> 04:31.105
Let's see if I can make
this nice and clear.

04:31.173 --> 04:33.441
So...

04:33.509 --> 04:36.344
I need a really good horse,

04:36.378 --> 04:37.345
or at least as good
as Buckingham,

04:37.379 --> 04:38.679
but... problem,

04:38.747 --> 04:41.515
I can't afford a horse
as good as Buckingham.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.084
So I mean I was hoping
I could've avoided this,

04:45.152 --> 04:47.020
but when you broke
your promise

04:47.088 --> 04:50.257
about letting me compete
on Phoenix,

04:50.291 --> 04:53.226
you didn't really leave me
any other option.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.694
So...

04:54.762 --> 04:57.063
Who's really to blame here?

04:58.865 --> 05:00.066
You.

Before you leave,
you have to sign off

06:07.831 --> 06:10.465
on some paperwork
at Reception.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.067
What kind of paperwork?

06:12.102 --> 06:13.468
Consent for anesthesia
and surgery,

06:13.503 --> 06:15.403
and other pre-surgical
pain management.

06:15.438 --> 06:16.804
And you also have to
sign off on an estimate

06:16.839 --> 06:18.272
for the cost
of the procedure.

06:18.306 --> 06:20.541
Yeah, good old
Doctor Cardinal, unh?

06:20.609 --> 06:23.942
Always keeping his eye
on the bottom line.

06:25.047 --> 06:26.881
The reception is
right down there.

06:26.915 --> 06:29.583
Yeah, I know
where it is.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.654
Lou: Okay, Katie, come
on, let's go inside.

Well, you know how them buckle bunnies
go wild for a winner.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.850
I can only imagine.

07:05.885 --> 07:07.752
Um, do you mind?

07:07.787 --> 07:09.688
I've been working on a list
and uh...

07:09.755 --> 07:11.122
You can get started
right away.

07:32.876 --> 07:33.843

07:33.877 --> 07:35.545
all Jeremy cares about
is winning.

07:35.613 --> 07:38.047
You know he's blaming me
for this, right?

07:38.115 --> 07:39.716
Why, because you wouldn't
let him ride Phoenix?

07:39.783 --> 07:41.351
- Yeah.
- What a jerk.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.086
Yeah, I know.

07:43.153 --> 07:44.454
It was his decision, Amy.

07:44.488 --> 07:46.055
You did everything you could
to talk him out of it.

(Buckingham grunts)

08:08.844 --> 08:10.511
What are you giving him?

08:10.546 --> 08:12.480
Detomidine hydrochloride.
Just half a mil.

08:12.514 --> 08:13.881
- It's a horse-
- Horse tranquilizer.

08:13.915 --> 08:16.016
I know.
That's right.

08:16.051 --> 08:17.017
Why are you giving it
to him?

08:17.052 --> 08:18.352
It's just a precaution,

08:18.386 --> 08:21.388
just so he doesn't injure
himself before surgery.

08:21.422 --> 08:24.691
8:47 P.M.

08:24.726 --> 08:27.327
Intravenous injection

08:27.362 --> 08:29.863
Zero point five
millilitres.

08:29.897 --> 08:32.065
- What?
- Nothing.

08:32.099 --> 08:34.267
You just look like
a real vet.

08:34.301 --> 08:37.102
Only four more years to go.

08:39.072 --> 08:40.306
(Bags crinkle)

08:44.278 --> 08:45.678
Well, that's it!

08:45.712 --> 08:48.581
See? Goes a lot quicker
when there's two of us.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.848
So what do you think,

08:49.883 --> 08:51.816
you gonna stick around
for a while this time?

08:51.850 --> 08:53.551
Caleb: Definitely until
Amy brings Spartan home

08:53.586 --> 08:55.287
and can pick up
some of the slack.

08:55.321 --> 08:56.488
But uh...

08:56.522 --> 08:58.356
I guess it just kinda depends,
after that.

08:58.391 --> 09:00.158
Well, that depends
on what?

09:00.192 --> 09:01.559
Peter?

09:01.594 --> 09:03.395
Peter.

09:03.429 --> 09:05.563
Okay, yeah, we...
Had a little scuffle,

09:05.598 --> 09:07.765
but, I mean,
everything's okay now.

09:07.799 --> 09:09.333
And Lou?

09:09.367 --> 09:10.601
Lou.

09:10.635 --> 09:13.604
(Chuckles) Nothin'.
Just...

09:13.638 --> 09:16.971
Reminds me of when Ty
first showed up here

09:17.676 --> 09:20.043
and I told him he had
to keep ten feet away

09:20.077 --> 09:23.045
from my granddaughters
at all times,

09:23.079 --> 09:24.514
and that any part
of his body

09:24.548 --> 09:27.881
that crossed that line
would be removed.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.753
Now...

09:31.722 --> 09:33.589
Well, I guess
that goes double

09:33.624 --> 09:36.125
for a married
granddaughter.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.126
I'm quite sure
I don't know

09:37.160 --> 09:39.093
what you're talking about.

09:39.128 --> 09:41.863
Well, let's hope
you never find out.

09:53.409 --> 09:54.442
(Sighs heavily)

09:54.476 --> 09:55.776
Oh! Hi, Amy.

09:55.811 --> 09:56.892
I didn't know
you were here.

09:56.945 --> 09:57.978
Yeah, yeah.

09:58.046 --> 09:59.480
Uh, I just,
I'm just finishing up.

09:59.548 --> 10:01.382
It's really great you're doing
all that massage therapy

10:01.450 --> 10:02.516
on Spartan.

10:02.551 --> 10:04.685
I'm sure
it's really helping.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.520
Yeah, actually,
Scott seems to think so.

10:08.457 --> 10:09.857
Here are the files.

10:09.924 --> 10:13.257
We've got three horses in -
Spartan, Taboo, and...

10:14.528 --> 10:16.095
Buckingham.

10:16.163 --> 10:17.330
Ty:
Yeah, I just gave him a shot.

10:17.398 --> 10:18.431
Half a mil-

10:22.236 --> 10:23.336
(Phone beeps)

10:26.139 --> 10:27.773
Um, what was that?

10:27.807 --> 10:29.307
I gave Buckingham a small dose
of detomidine -

10:29.376 --> 10:30.576
<i>half a mil -</i>

10:30.610 --> 10:31.844
<i>just to keep him calm</i>
<i>until the morning.</i>

10:31.878 --> 10:33.579
Thanks. I'll check on him
in a couple of hours.

10:33.646 --> 10:36.448
Okay, and you're up to speed
on everything else in here?

10:36.516 --> 10:38.617
Yeah, I think I can
handle it, Ty.

10:38.685 --> 10:39.785
Okay. Ready to go?

10:39.853 --> 10:41.219
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

10:41.287 --> 10:42.920
See you later, Amy.

10:42.988 --> 10:44.188
Yeah, see you.

10:48.293 --> 10:49.794
(Water babbles,
birds chirp)

10:49.828 --> 10:51.896
Ty: Amy, there's no law against
getting your horse de-nerved,

10:51.963 --> 10:53.631
so I'm not sure
what we can do.

10:53.665 --> 10:55.032
We could talk to Scott.

10:55.066 --> 10:57.902
I mean, maybe he could change
Jeremy's mind!

10:57.936 --> 11:00.704
You know how this
process works.

11:00.772 --> 11:01.853
Once you talk
to the clients

11:01.873 --> 11:03.106
and you give them
the consequences,

11:03.173 --> 11:04.808
you just have
to step back.

11:04.876 --> 11:06.042
If you wanna be
in this business,

11:06.076 --> 11:07.756
you're gonna have to make
some compromises.

11:07.779 --> 11:10.246
Yeah, but what if you don't
make those compromises?

11:10.314 --> 11:12.215
Oh yeah, sure,
you may not make as much money,

11:12.283 --> 11:13.550
but in the long run...

11:13.584 --> 11:16.719
You really think this
is about making money?

11:16.787 --> 11:18.320
I know.
I'm sorry, I...

11:19.890 --> 11:21.170
(Sighs) I'm just-
I'm frustrated,

11:21.190 --> 11:22.691
you know, I don't know
what to do, I-

11:22.726 --> 11:25.193
I know, I get that.

11:26.228 --> 11:29.498
But it's not gonna do us any good
taking it out on Scott.

11:29.566 --> 11:31.766
You're right.

11:31.801 --> 11:34.101
I should probably go,
though.

11:34.136 --> 11:36.070
You don't wanna stick around
for a bit, hang out?

11:36.104 --> 11:37.705
- I'd love to.
- Hmm?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.408
But you've got a big day
tomorrow,

11:40.443 --> 11:41.910
and I've still got work
to do.

11:41.944 --> 11:43.244
Okay.

11:58.893 --> 12:00.293
Hello?

12:03.363 --> 12:04.597
Cassandra:
I don't know what happened!

12:04.631 --> 12:05.832
When I checked on him,
there was nothing wrong!

12:05.866 --> 12:07.567
- When was that?
- Just after midnight.

12:07.601 --> 12:08.634
I swear he was fine!

12:08.669 --> 12:09.936
And then when I came in
this morning,

12:09.970 --> 12:11.103
- he was...
- Did you call Scott?

12:11.137 --> 12:12.304
Is he on his way?

12:12.339 --> 12:14.574
No, I haven't
called him yet!

12:14.608 --> 12:16.008
What?! Why not?

12:16.042 --> 12:17.076
I don't know,
I just...

12:17.110 --> 12:19.478
I-I didn't know
what to tell him!

12:19.512 --> 12:21.179
(Stall door clanks)

12:23.649 --> 12:25.049
(Sighs heavily)

12:41.600 --> 12:44.267
You better call Scott.

12:44.302 --> 12:46.436
Buckingham's dead.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.299
<i>Scott: Did either of
you see anything,</i>

12:54.334 --> 12:56.601
notice any problems
at all?

12:56.669 --> 12:59.136
He seemed perfectly fine
when I left, Scott.

12:59.171 --> 13:01.038
I did the rounds
just after midnight.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.607
I didn't see anything unusual
until this morning

13:02.675 --> 13:05.409
when he was on the floor.

13:05.444 --> 13:06.643
(Sighs)

13:06.711 --> 13:07.544
Well, there's nothing here
other than the problem

13:07.612 --> 13:09.981
with his navicular.

13:10.048 --> 13:13.017
And he was in perfect health
when Jeremy brought him in.

13:13.051 --> 13:14.518
Ty:
Well...

13:14.586 --> 13:16.653
So what do you think
it could be?

13:16.688 --> 13:19.390
Cerebral hemorrhage?
Cardiac arrest?

13:19.458 --> 13:21.724
Scott: We're gonna have
to wait for the autopsy.

13:21.792 --> 13:25.125
But for now, I...
I have to make a phone call.

13:25.296 --> 13:26.729
(Buttons beeping)

13:29.766 --> 13:31.034
Hello, Jeremy?

13:32.036 --> 13:34.304
Yes, this is Doctor Cardinal.

13:35.272 --> 13:38.507
<i>I'm afraid I have</i>

you all right?

13:50.053 --> 13:51.820

13:51.888 --> 13:53.287
Yeah, I just...

13:54.256 --> 13:56.290
<i>I feel like such a fool.</i>

13:57.259 --> 14:00.294
You didn't do anything wrong.
No one saw this coming.

14:00.362 --> 14:02.497
Yeah.

14:02.564 --> 14:05.897
Maybe I missed something,
or...

14:06.301 --> 14:08.502
Maybe if I'd checked
on him earlier,

14:08.569 --> 14:11.238
I would've noticed
something was off.

14:11.272 --> 14:12.772
What are you
talking about?

14:12.840 --> 14:15.942
Even Scott didn't
see anything.

14:17.412 --> 14:19.679
Yeah, of course.

14:20.681 --> 14:22.982
I'm just really upset.

14:23.017 --> 14:24.150
What kind of vet
would I make

14:24.217 --> 14:26.818
if every time something
like this happened,

14:26.853 --> 14:28.187
I fall to pieces!

14:49.775 --> 14:51.142
Hey, Lou.

14:51.177 --> 14:53.478
Lou: Katie and I were just
about to head into town.

14:53.512 --> 14:54.745
Okay, you give me
five minutes

14:54.780 --> 14:56.513
and this thing
is gonna look brand new,

14:56.548 --> 14:57.747
I swear!

14:57.782 --> 15:00.451
Okay,
I guess we can wait.

15:01.453 --> 15:03.520
You missed a spot.

15:05.423 --> 15:08.658
How did it happen?
Do you know how he died?

15:08.693 --> 15:09.993
We have to wait
for the autopsy results

15:10.027 --> 15:11.195
to come back.

15:11.229 --> 15:13.463
The toxicology report.

15:14.398 --> 15:16.199
Hey, what's wrong
with you guys?

15:16.233 --> 15:19.068
Um, we were just
talking about...

15:20.003 --> 15:21.370
Jeremy's horse,
he's um...

15:21.438 --> 15:24.540
Mallory: He's dead, I know.
Scott was in here earlier.

15:24.575 --> 15:25.541
Can I get you guys
anything else,

15:25.576 --> 15:26.542
or just the bill?

15:26.577 --> 15:28.643
Mallory!

15:28.677 --> 15:31.413
Mallory: I know this might make
me sound like a bad person,

15:31.447 --> 15:34.449
but I can't help thinking
that this is totally his fault,

15:34.484 --> 15:37.752
and I hope he's really messed up
about it.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.356
I thought Mallory
had a thing for Jeremy.

15:41.390 --> 15:42.591
That's over.

15:42.625 --> 15:45.025
She blames him
for what happened to Spartan.

15:45.059 --> 15:47.161
Wasn't he just standing
at the fence?

15:47.195 --> 15:48.962
With Cassandra.

15:48.997 --> 15:50.931
She blames him
for leading her on,

15:50.965 --> 15:53.267
and making her
lose her focus,

15:53.301 --> 15:55.236
and she blames herself
for falling for it

15:55.270 --> 15:56.903
in the first place.

15:56.971 --> 15:59.540
That's a lot of blaming.

16:02.243 --> 16:04.011
(Katie coos)

16:04.045 --> 16:05.779
Lou: Thank you very much.
Give it to me, please!

16:16.057 --> 16:18.124
So, did you get
your recorder?

16:18.158 --> 16:19.191
Yeah.

16:19.225 --> 16:20.325
Hey, Katie.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.393
And?

16:22.696 --> 16:24.797
Look at what they gave us!

16:24.865 --> 16:26.732
It looks like
a perfectly good recorder.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.634
Yeah, that's what sucks
about it!

16:28.702 --> 16:30.970
I'm sorry, Georgie,
but I don't see the problem.

16:31.004 --> 16:32.471
Okay, maybe I'm stupid,

16:32.539 --> 16:34.072
but when the teacher
said recorder,

16:34.140 --> 16:35.273
I thought she meant
one of those cool little

16:35.340 --> 16:37.241
digital voice recorder thingies.

16:37.309 --> 16:38.943

You've got a nasty little drip
under there.

17:10.207 --> 17:12.775
The floor could get wet,
someone could have a bad fall.

17:12.843 --> 17:13.976
You know, most people think
that the kitchen

17:14.011 --> 17:15.243
is the most dangerous room
in the house,

17:15.278 --> 17:17.346
but my vote's
for the bathroom.

17:17.414 --> 17:19.615
Okay, thank you,
but really...

17:19.683 --> 17:21.883
Grampa usually takes care
of things like this.

17:21.951 --> 17:24.352
Yeah, I just kinda miss doing
this sort of thing, you know?

17:24.386 --> 17:26.922
Taking care of a home,
having someone to look after,

17:26.989 --> 17:28.455
having someone depend on me.

17:28.490 --> 17:29.958
You miss being married.

Nope. Caleb was just
fixing the sink.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.572
Yeah, and I'm done now,
actually.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.573
See? No more drip.

17:46.641 --> 17:49.543
So I guess I'll be
on my way.

17:49.577 --> 17:51.746
What did I say!

17:54.514 --> 17:56.082

Toxicology report.

18:15.835 --> 18:18.503
Scott's on the phone
with the insurance company.

18:18.537 --> 18:19.571
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Well, we can get more samples.</i>

18:19.605 --> 18:21.439
What have we got?

18:21.474 --> 18:23.175
Right there.

18:24.110 --> 18:25.477
Detomidine?

18:25.511 --> 18:28.179
See how high
the levels are?

18:28.213 --> 18:30.282
Wow! No way!

18:31.950 --> 18:34.452
Yeah, but hold on.

18:34.487 --> 18:35.720
My insurance company
wants to run

18:35.755 --> 18:37.889
some more sophisticated tests.

18:37.923 --> 18:40.292
Well, what if the results
come back the same, Scott?

18:40.326 --> 18:41.958
Scott:
Then we're in trouble.

18:41.993 --> 18:44.495
The levels were way
off the chart.

18:44.529 --> 18:46.630
So, if the horse died
of a cardiac arrest

18:46.665 --> 18:48.332
caused by an overdose...

18:48.366 --> 18:50.668
And I was the last one
to give him a shot.

18:50.702 --> 18:52.836
Yeah.

18:52.870 --> 18:53.937
(Groans)

18:54.005 --> 18:56.573
You wrote zero point five

Yes. Absolutely, Scott.
One hundred percent.

<i>Scott: Well, let's not
jump to any conclusions.</i>

19:04.348 --> 19:05.548

19:05.616 --> 19:08.384
the insurance company
wants to run more tests.

So let's just keep
our fingers crossed.

Apparently she thought

19:27.337 --> 19:29.304
she was getting
a digital recorder.

19:29.338 --> 19:31.138
Like a tape recorder.

19:31.206 --> 19:32.573
Well, I don't know,

19:32.641 --> 19:34.375
maybe we should apply
a little pressure.

19:34.409 --> 19:35.476
What do you think?

19:35.544 --> 19:37.578
Well, I know
I'm new at this,

19:37.646 --> 19:38.813
but if you read my blog,

19:38.880 --> 19:40.080
you'll see that
I don't believe

19:40.081 --> 19:42.282
that forcing a child
to do something

19:42.317 --> 19:44.452
is going to make them
genuinely interested.

19:44.486 --> 19:45.918
Okay,
what does your blog say

19:45.953 --> 19:48.588
about giving Georgie
something she wants

19:48.656 --> 19:49.723
if she practices?

19:49.757 --> 19:50.990
Like a bribe?

19:51.058 --> 19:52.392
No, not a bribe,

19:52.460 --> 19:54.361
more like a carrot
on a stick;

19:54.428 --> 19:55.562
Like a reward.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.196
Okay, but is it a reward
for doing something,

19:57.231 --> 19:58.698
or for refusing
to do something,

19:58.766 --> 20:00.299
because I'm not gonna
play that game.

20:00.334 --> 20:02.468
I don't know, Lou.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.669
So what's your plan,
then?

20:03.737 --> 20:06.438
Just let her sink or swim
all on her own?

20:06.506 --> 20:09.207
No, we're gonna do
what parents should do.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.910
We are gonna help her
discover the...

20:11.978 --> 20:13.712
Intrinsic value
of the behaviour

20:13.780 --> 20:15.647
or activity in question.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.448
That's good.
I should write that.

20:17.516 --> 20:18.883
I see.
(Scoffs)

20:18.950 --> 20:20.485
<i>(Keys tap)</i>

20:22.187 --> 20:25.490
<i>Ty: Hey, Jeremy, what're
you doing back here?</i>

20:25.557 --> 20:27.291
Just looking for Scott.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.394
Ty:
I gotta say,

20:29.461 --> 20:30.961
we're all real sorry
about what happened.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.430
But you shouldn't be
back here.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.463
If you wanna give
Scott a call,

20:33.498 --> 20:35.732
or leave a message
with me...

20:35.767 --> 20:38.001
Jeremy: You want me
to leave a message?

20:38.068 --> 20:40.670
Okay, I've got a message
for you:

20:40.738 --> 20:43.106
Thanks for killing my horse!

20:45.877 --> 20:48.211
You don't know
what you're talking about.

20:48.245 --> 20:49.578
No one knows
what happened.

20:49.646 --> 20:51.480
Well,
the way I heard it,

20:51.548 --> 20:54.517
you gave him a shot
before you left -

20:54.551 --> 20:57.119
and... remind me
what it was?

20:57.153 --> 20:59.254
Oh yeah, detomidine -

20:59.289 --> 21:01.056
and what a coincidence!

21:01.124 --> 21:03.926
It turns out he had
enough detomidine in him,

21:03.993 --> 21:05.993
well, to kill a horse.

21:06.929 --> 21:08.563
And you know
what that means...

21:08.597 --> 21:11.699
Besides the fact
that you're a total screw-up!

21:11.734 --> 21:13.735
This isn't doing
anybody any good.

21:13.803 --> 21:15.937
It means that
I'm gonna sue your ass,

21:16.004 --> 21:17.271
and Scott's too.

21:17.306 --> 21:19.140
Get the whole damn clinic
closed down

21:19.174 --> 21:22.142
because I don't wanna see
any more animals die

21:22.209 --> 21:23.977
because of you.

21:26.147 --> 21:27.213
But you know
what's gonna give me

21:27.248 --> 21:30.050
the most satisfaction?

21:30.084 --> 21:33.019
Destroying any chance
you might ever have

21:33.054 --> 21:35.121
of becoming a vet!

21:43.630 --> 21:46.963
♪

21:55.663 --> 21:58.232
<i>Amy: You were right;
Jeremy's a total creep.</i>

21:58.266 --> 22:01.599
But accusing you of this,
it just proves it.

22:02.537 --> 22:04.271
But what if it's true?

22:04.306 --> 22:05.705
Ty, I was there.

22:07.008 --> 22:09.575
You explained to me every step
of what you were doing.

22:09.610 --> 22:12.612
Which means I was talking
the whole time.

22:12.646 --> 22:15.015
Maybe I was more concerned
about looking like a real vet

22:15.049 --> 22:16.749
than making sure
I got him the right dose.

22:16.783 --> 22:17.984
You looked like a real vet

22:18.019 --> 22:19.986
because you were doing
everything right.

22:20.021 --> 22:21.321
He died.

22:21.389 --> 22:23.956
He died of an overdose
and someone screwed up.

22:24.024 --> 22:26.225
And if it wasn't me,
then who was it?

22:27.494 --> 22:30.827
Jack: So... what about that other
girl that works at the clinic there?

22:31.031 --> 22:31.998
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

22:32.032 --> 22:34.333
Cassandra? No.

22:34.401 --> 22:37.369
What if she thought she was supposed
to give him another injection?

22:37.437 --> 22:39.437
Ty: Then she would've written
it down on the chart.

22:39.471 --> 22:41.139
Let me offer you
some legal advice.

22:41.173 --> 22:42.206
If everyone else
is innocent,

22:42.241 --> 22:43.642
it does not look
so good for you.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.149
Georgie:
Ty would never kill a horse!

22:45.177 --> 22:47.946
Lou: Of course not, Georgie.
Nobody is saying he would.

22:48.014 --> 22:50.481
There's lots of reasons
why a horse might just drop dead

22:50.516 --> 22:51.482
in a stall.

22:51.517 --> 22:54.351
Yeah,
like performance anxiety.

22:54.385 --> 22:55.853
A friend of mine
had a great roping horse,

22:55.887 --> 22:57.187
Mr. Big Stuff.

22:57.255 --> 22:58.989
Problem was he always got
really wound up in the box.

22:59.057 --> 23:00.390
Then one day,
at the Medicine Hat rodeo,

23:00.458 --> 23:01.926
he's waiting for the chute
to open,

23:01.993 --> 23:04.962
and the damn horse
just drops dead!

23:07.999 --> 23:09.366
I'm just saying.

23:10.534 --> 23:11.668
Okay.

23:14.071 --> 23:16.573
<i>Jack: So how's it goin'
with that recorder?</i>

23:16.640 --> 23:18.074
Georgie:
Oh.

23:18.108 --> 23:20.677
Um, not so good,
I guess.

23:20.744 --> 23:22.879
Yeah? You wanna tell me
what the problem is?

23:22.913 --> 23:24.213
No problem.

23:25.182 --> 23:26.414
Hey.

23:26.449 --> 23:29.782
Did you know that I used
to play guitar in a band?

23:30.519 --> 23:32.821
And let me tell you,
is it ever a lot of fun

23:32.889 --> 23:36.157
when you can play music
with your friends.

23:36.225 --> 23:38.259
Guitar, maybe.

23:38.327 --> 23:39.360
Or drums.

23:39.428 --> 23:41.063
But a recorder?

23:41.097 --> 23:42.897
It's not even
a real instrument!

23:42.965 --> 23:45.265
Yeah, but once you can play
the recorder,

23:45.333 --> 23:47.267
it'll help you learn
to play something else,

23:47.335 --> 23:48.402
like a guitar.

23:49.370 --> 23:50.537
(Georgie sighs)

23:51.473 --> 23:53.173
Okay, but...

23:53.241 --> 23:55.576
I guess I'm just not
really into music.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.944
Jack: Georgie, if you don't
learn to play this tune,

23:58.012 --> 23:59.846
then you could fail
the course!

23:59.880 --> 24:01.147
Who cares?

24:01.215 --> 24:04.548
No one ever got held back
'cause they flunked music.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.492

24:16.162 --> 24:18.296

24:31.476 --> 24:32.543
Ty!

24:34.079 --> 24:35.947
What're you doing
with my phone?

24:35.981 --> 24:38.549
Uh, you got a text message,
I just thought that I-

24:38.583 --> 24:41.152
Thought what?
That you'd check it for me?

24:41.186 --> 24:42.720
No! Of course not,
I just...

24:42.755 --> 24:43.821
I saw it there

24:43.856 --> 24:45.089
and I picked it up
without thinking.

24:45.124 --> 24:46.804
I didn't know it was your phone,
Cassandra.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.061
Okay, the truth is...

24:51.996 --> 24:54.197
Your phone went off
the night Buckingham died.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.999
<i>Right before we left,</i>
<i>you checked it.</i>

24:56.034 --> 24:57.701
I got a random text
from a friend.

24:57.735 --> 24:59.136
So what?

24:59.170 --> 25:01.471
I heard the same ringtone
and I was...

25:01.505 --> 25:02.538
I was curious.

25:02.572 --> 25:04.206
(Scoffs)

25:04.240 --> 25:07.573
Well, you know what they say
about curiosity, Ty.

25:07.911 --> 25:10.713
That thing
how it killed the cat?

Caleb,
what are you doing?

25:35.737 --> 25:36.904
Don't worry, Lou.

25:36.938 --> 25:38.259
I've always had a knack
with kids.

25:38.272 --> 25:40.140
Which is a little bit strange,

25:40.175 --> 25:42.109
seeing as I've never had
a little brother or sister.

25:42.177 --> 25:44.144
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Um, listen.</i>

25:44.179 --> 25:45.713
I appreciate the help,
I really do,

25:45.780 --> 25:48.816
but, Caleb, I'm not paying you
to be a babysitter,

25:48.883 --> 25:51.650
or to wash my car,
or to fix the sink.

25:51.719 --> 25:53.320
<i>Caleb: Yeah, I mean...
It's pretty obvious</i>

25:53.353 --> 25:54.587
you need a man around here,
though.

<i>Lou:</i>
<i>No, I don't, Caleb!</i>

25:56.656 --> 25:59.525
But you know what I do need?
I need a ranch hand!

25:59.559 --> 26:00.793
So why don't you go back
to the barn

26:00.861 --> 26:01.928
and grab a shovel,

26:01.995 --> 26:02.895
and stick to doing
what a ranch hand

26:02.930 --> 26:04.330
is supposed to do!

26:08.201 --> 26:09.367
Fine.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.105
<i>(Door opens and bangs shut)</i>

26:14.540 --> 26:16.141
I got your message.

26:16.209 --> 26:17.142
What's up?

26:17.210 --> 26:18.509
Let's go talk
over breakfast.

26:18.544 --> 26:20.278
Whoa, just...

26:20.346 --> 26:21.613
Tell me right now.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.714
(Sighs heavily)
Okay.

26:27.018 --> 26:28.585
There's a problem
at the insurance company,

26:28.653 --> 26:31.055
and, uh, we're still waiting
for the new test result,

26:31.123 --> 26:33.423
but if something
doesn't change, uh...

26:33.491 --> 26:35.960
I'm gonna have to cut you back
on your hours.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.461
How far back?

26:37.528 --> 26:38.862
All the way.

26:38.863 --> 26:42.196
Um, I need you to take
a leave of absence.

26:43.868 --> 26:45.368
You're firing me.

26:45.435 --> 26:47.804
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this,

26:47.872 --> 26:49.405
but you know
how it works.

26:49.439 --> 26:51.540
Jeremy's insurance company
is coming after mine,

26:51.575 --> 26:54.042
and I'm on the hook
for 100,000 dollars.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.677
A hundred thousand?

26:55.711 --> 26:58.613
<i>Scott: Yeah, that's what
Buckingham was insured for.</i>

26:58.681 --> 26:59.848
And they're gonna cancel
my policy

26:59.916 --> 27:02.450
if I keep you on
at the clinic.

27:02.518 --> 27:04.086
Why?

27:04.154 --> 27:06.388
They consider you a risk.

27:06.422 --> 27:07.421
(Sighs)

27:07.422 --> 27:08.690
Okay, I get it.

27:08.758 --> 27:10.658
This is not permanent, Ty.

27:10.725 --> 27:12.426
So hang in tough,
okay?

27:12.460 --> 27:13.928
If you need any help
with cash,

27:13.962 --> 27:15.863
you know, I can help.

27:15.931 --> 27:19.233
I appreciate the offer,
but I'll be okay.

27:19.301 --> 27:20.668
Thanks, though.

27:20.735 --> 27:21.936
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Look on the bright side.</i>

27:21.970 --> 27:24.138
You're gonna be
a great vet one day.

27:24.173 --> 27:25.639
But school's tough.

27:42.296 --> 27:43.597
He fired you?

27:43.631 --> 27:45.899
It's his insurance company.

27:45.934 --> 27:48.702
He said he didn't
have a choice.

27:48.736 --> 27:52.069
So he's just gonna
leave you hanging then?

27:52.539 --> 27:55.307
Scott's doing everything he can
to work it out.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.445
But I don't know, Amy,
um...

27:59.479 --> 28:00.846
I need this job!

28:00.881 --> 28:02.615
I need the money.

28:02.649 --> 28:03.849
I don't know what
I'm gonna do right now.

28:03.884 --> 28:06.184
There's other
vet clinics, Ty.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.619
There are at least three
in Okotoks,

28:07.653 --> 28:08.687
one in High River.

28:08.721 --> 28:10.989
There's that big one
in Bragg Creek.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.591
Yeah, but what are
the chances

28:12.625 --> 28:13.825
that I'm gonna get hired
at a clinic

28:13.859 --> 28:16.194
after something
like this?

28:16.228 --> 28:18.229
And who's gonna give me
a reference?

28:18.263 --> 28:20.065
Scott?

28:20.099 --> 28:21.732
It's okay.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.501
All right?
We'll work it out.

28:24.535 --> 28:26.203
Yeah, I know.

28:30.441 --> 28:32.309
Cassandra:
Ty?

28:32.376 --> 28:35.378
Scott said you're not supposed
to come back here anymore.

28:35.446 --> 28:38.748
<i>So I'm sorry,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to go.</i>

28:38.816 --> 28:40.650
(Laughs humourlessly)

28:40.684 --> 28:41.751
Okay.

28:47.858 --> 28:48.992
(Birds chirp)

28:50.327 --> 28:51.560
(Hay crackles)

28:57.266 --> 29:00.599
Lou: Caleb, I'm sorry for
snapping at you the way I did.

29:00.937 --> 29:02.938
It's water off
a duck's back, Lou.

29:03.006 --> 29:05.340
As for me needing
another man around here,

29:05.374 --> 29:06.307
let me remind you,

29:06.375 --> 29:07.976
I have a perfectly
good husband!

29:08.044 --> 29:09.210
I know that.

29:09.278 --> 29:11.178
And maybe we're going
through a bumpy stretch -

29:11.246 --> 29:12.886
a short-term bumpy stretch,
I assure you -

29:12.948 --> 29:15.983
but it was wrong of me
to talk to you

29:16.051 --> 29:18.452
about our personal problems.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.954
I was just trying
to help out.

29:19.955 --> 29:21.388
I know, but you're not helping,
Caleb!

29:21.422 --> 29:23.624
You're making it worse!

29:23.625 --> 29:25.225
Why don't you just hook up

29:25.226 --> 29:26.225
with one of those
buckle bunnies

29:26.226 --> 29:27.593
you were telling me about,

29:27.594 --> 29:30.927
and stop following me around
like a faithful dog.

29:31.032 --> 29:34.266
You know what, Lou?
You got it all wrong.

29:36.503 --> 29:39.039
I know a thing or two
about bumpy stretches,

29:39.106 --> 29:41.274
trust me.

29:41.341 --> 29:44.509
You might not fool around,
but your heart does.

29:45.945 --> 29:48.881
And I have to admit,
I mean, I'm flattered -

29:48.915 --> 29:50.683
admittedly,
very flattered -

29:50.750 --> 29:51.784
but this thing
you have with me,

29:52.318 --> 29:54.219
it's all in your head.

30:00.459 --> 30:03.061
There you go: Two turkey BLT's,
hold the mayo.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.063
Amy:
Thanks, Mal.

30:05.130 --> 30:07.699
Mallory: Hey, um, I heard about Ty.
That really sucks!

30:07.766 --> 30:09.133
How's he taking it?

30:09.202 --> 30:12.504
He's okay,
but it's so unfair.

30:12.572 --> 30:14.371
He wasn't even the only one
in the clinic that night.

30:14.406 --> 30:16.507
Cassandra was there too.

30:16.541 --> 30:18.909
You think Cassandra
killed Buckingham?

30:18.943 --> 30:22.276
I don't know...
But I know Ty didn't do it.

30:23.582 --> 30:24.582
You know what you were saying
the other day

30:24.616 --> 30:27.751
about how it was
all Jeremy's fault,

30:27.785 --> 30:29.886
what did you mean?

30:29.921 --> 30:33.122
Okay, I know this
sounds stupid,

30:33.190 --> 30:35.391
but I really think
Jeremy deliberately

30:35.426 --> 30:37.193
went out of his way
to make me like him.

30:37.261 --> 30:38.928
He even gave me
a cute nickname.

30:38.962 --> 30:39.929
Blondie.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.864
Yeah, and I totally
fell for it.

30:41.898 --> 30:43.566
Well, you had a crush
on him.

30:43.601 --> 30:45.801
Yeah, love is blind.

30:45.836 --> 30:47.068
But the thing is,

30:47.103 --> 30:49.404
he lied to me
for no reason at all.

30:49.439 --> 30:51.005
So what makes you think
that he's not lying

30:51.040 --> 30:52.574
to everyone else?

30:52.609 --> 30:54.443
What would he be
lying about?

30:54.477 --> 30:57.546
Well, Buckingham
for starters.

30:59.982 --> 31:02.050
(Fire pops and crackles)

31:03.752 --> 31:05.553
(Lou clears her throat)

31:05.587 --> 31:06.887
Lou:
Are you busy?

31:06.921 --> 31:08.723
Sort of.

31:08.757 --> 31:11.492
See, I was thinking maybe
you should drop the magazine

31:11.526 --> 31:12.893
and I don't know...

31:12.927 --> 31:15.129
Practice your recorder?

31:15.163 --> 31:17.698
(Sighs)
I hate that recorder!

31:17.733 --> 31:18.831
I mean, I wouldn't even
have bought it

31:18.866 --> 31:21.100
if I knew I had to play it!

31:22.035 --> 31:23.436
Lou:
Shove over.

31:24.472 --> 31:25.805
(Georgie sighs)

31:27.074 --> 31:29.108
What did you think
you were gonna do?

31:29.143 --> 31:31.244
I don't know,
record stuff.

31:31.279 --> 31:32.379
What kind of stuff?

31:32.413 --> 31:34.046
People talking,
saying funny things -

31:34.081 --> 31:35.013
stuff like that!

31:35.081 --> 31:36.148
I thought it would be fun,

31:36.182 --> 31:39.017
but I guess it was just
some dumb idea.

31:39.051 --> 31:41.853
It's not dumb, okay?
But...

31:43.757 --> 31:46.992
Okay, promise not to say
anything to Grandpa?

31:47.026 --> 31:48.193
Yeah.

31:48.227 --> 31:50.528
If you learn the song
like you're supposed to,

31:50.562 --> 31:51.996
I will get you
a digital recorder.

31:52.063 --> 31:53.431
Top of the line.

31:53.465 --> 31:56.798
Well, I guess
that would be okay.

31:56.835 --> 31:59.170
So, do we have a deal?

32:01.340 --> 32:03.308
Amy: You know, I always figured
that, at the very least,

32:03.375 --> 32:05.176
Jeremy loved his horse.

32:05.210 --> 32:07.811
But Mallory,
she thinks it's all an act.

32:07.845 --> 32:09.479
You know, she thinks that
he doesn't love anything

32:09.514 --> 32:10.480
but himself.

32:10.548 --> 32:11.715
Thank you.

32:11.783 --> 32:13.417
Ty: Well, she sounds
like a teenage girl

32:13.484 --> 32:15.819
who's just had her heart broken
by some jerk.

32:15.886 --> 32:16.853
Maybe,

32:16.921 --> 32:18.488
but that doesn't mean
she's wrong.

32:18.556 --> 32:21.057
I mean, what if he never gave
a damn about his horse?

32:23.092 --> 32:26.128
Okay...
Let's say you're right.

32:26.196 --> 32:28.698
Why would he want
his horse dead?

32:28.765 --> 32:29.965
Insurance?

32:30.033 --> 32:32.201
A horse like Buckingham
could be worth fifty,

32:32.268 --> 32:34.036
sixty thousand.

32:34.103 --> 32:35.438
A hundred.

32:35.505 --> 32:37.072
Mm-mm.
Not Buckingham.

32:37.106 --> 32:38.273
He was a good horse,
but he's not worth that.

32:38.341 --> 32:40.675
No, Amy, Scott told me
he insured him

32:40.710 --> 32:42.744
for a hundred thousand
dollars.

Jeremy.

Okay.

35:22.145 --> 35:23.178

35:23.247 --> 35:24.680
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

35:24.715 --> 35:26.681

"Jer Jer Binks."

35:33.256 --> 35:35.290
No, Ty!

Cassandra.

35:37.926 --> 35:39.494
That doesn't mean
anything!

You gotta stop
protecting him.

It's only gonna look

40:10.277 --> 40:12.978
(Plays a few squeaky notes)

40:13.947 --> 40:15.280
Can I start again?

40:15.314 --> 40:16.514
Yes.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.616
Okay.

40:19.552 --> 40:21.720
(Playing "Clementine")

40:21.755 --> 40:23.756
♪ Oh my darling ♪

40:23.790 --> 40:26.858
<i>♪ oh my darling Clementine ♪</i>

40:27.793 --> 40:30.795

40:31.997 --> 40:34.632

40:35.567 --> 40:36.667
(Laughing)

40:36.701 --> 40:37.969
- I made a couple of mistakes.
- No, no!

40:38.003 --> 40:40.337
But it was really,
really good!

40:40.372 --> 40:42.606
Lou: Really good?
It was excellent!

40:42.641 --> 40:43.807
Georgie:
Excellent?

40:43.841 --> 40:45.308
Does that mean I'm getting
a real recorder,

40:45.342 --> 40:47.010
<i>like you promised?</i>

40:47.044 --> 40:48.611
Like... you promised?

40:48.646 --> 40:51.213
Yeah, she said she'd buy me one
if I learned the song!

40:51.248 --> 40:53.015
Is that so?

40:54.251 --> 40:55.585
Can we go into town now?

40:55.653 --> 40:57.453
Lou:
We don't need to go into town.

40:57.488 --> 40:59.188
I just so happen...

40:59.222 --> 41:01.991
To have a recorder
right here.

41:02.025 --> 41:03.526
You bought one already?

41:03.594 --> 41:04.794
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>I was in Hudson anyway,</i>

41:04.861 --> 41:07.296
and I knew that you could do it
if you tried.

41:07.330 --> 41:08.730
Thank you!

41:08.765 --> 41:10.432
(Giggles excitedly)

41:11.768 --> 41:13.034
So...

41:13.969 --> 41:14.936
So.

41:14.970 --> 41:16.838
What happened to "No bribes"?

41:16.872 --> 41:18.106
I guess I thought of it

41:18.140 --> 41:20.208
as more of a carrot on a stick
sort of thing.

41:20.242 --> 41:21.576
Ah...

41:21.644 --> 41:23.444
Lou: Besides, Georgie really
wanted that recorder.

41:23.512 --> 41:26.580
Jack: Lou, I can't
say that I am happy

41:26.648 --> 41:27.748
with what you've done,

41:27.816 --> 41:29.983
but do you know
what the worst part is?

41:30.018 --> 41:32.085
That you stuck
to your principles,

41:32.153 --> 41:34.488
while I completely
went against mine?

41:34.556 --> 41:36.657
Jack:
Oh, not even close.

41:37.992 --> 41:40.794
No, the worst part is...

41:40.828 --> 41:44.161
Now what the heck am I gonna do
with this thing?

41:45.966 --> 41:48.034
(Laughs)
(Laughs)

41:51.505 --> 41:52.439
(Amy sighs)

41:52.506 --> 41:54.406
You know,
I don't get it.

41:54.474 --> 41:55.974
Why don't you
just tell Scott

41:56.042 --> 41:58.844
that Jeremy was in the clinic?

41:58.878 --> 42:01.046
Ty: I promised Cassandra
that I wouldn't.

42:01.113 --> 42:02.614
Oh.

42:02.682 --> 42:04.149
She was with him
the whole time.

42:04.183 --> 42:05.617
She said he never
went into the stables,

42:05.685 --> 42:08.320
he never even left her sight.

42:08.388 --> 42:10.521
Amy, she needs this job,
okay?

42:10.589 --> 42:11.622
If Scott fires her,

42:11.690 --> 42:13.424
she's gonna have to
drop out of school.

42:13.459 --> 42:16.792
And what about you?
What're you gonna do?

42:17.463 --> 42:20.231
Getting Cassandra fired
isn't gonna do me any good.

42:20.298 --> 42:21.300
(Sighs)

42:21.398 --> 42:22.600
Okay.

42:23.535 --> 42:26.770
Well, Caleb just left
on the rodeo circuit.

42:26.838 --> 42:28.739
Lou always needs help
at Heartland,

42:28.806 --> 42:32.139
if you're looking for a job
with flexible hours.

42:33.110 --> 42:34.478
How flexible?

42:34.545 --> 42:37.414
Well, you could work
when you're not in class -

42:37.448 --> 42:39.015
before school,

42:39.083 --> 42:41.017
after school -

42:41.051 --> 42:42.585
and if you're here late,

42:42.652 --> 42:45.521
you could always
just stay in the loft.

42:45.555 --> 42:47.189
And what's Jack gonna say
about that?

42:47.223 --> 42:50.225
I think he'd say he's happy
to have his hired hand back.

42:50.293 --> 42:51.560
And what about you?

42:51.595 --> 42:54.928
I guess
I'd be happy too.

42:55.899 --> 42:57.566
Okay, well...

42:57.601 --> 42:59.834
That sounds good,
but there's still one problem.

42:59.902 --> 43:01.436
And what problem is that?

43:01.470 --> 43:03.104
I...

43:03.138 --> 43:05.940
know that this whole thing
with Buckingham will work out.

43:05.974 --> 43:06.974
- Mm-hmm.
- I know it will.

43:07.009 --> 43:09.210
- Mm-hmm.
- And when it does,

43:09.278 --> 43:11.212
I'm gonna go back
to Scott's clinic

43:11.246 --> 43:12.714
and I am gonna work there.

43:12.748 --> 43:14.615
That's the problem?

43:14.649 --> 43:15.716
The problem is,

43:15.750 --> 43:17.117
don't get too used
to having me around

43:17.151 --> 43:18.118
all the time.

43:18.152 --> 43:19.453
Oh.

43:19.487 --> 43:21.254
Don't worry,
I won't.

43:21.289 --> 43:23.624
And don't make it too hard
for me to leave, either.

43:23.658 --> 43:25.392
Mm... that could be
the problem.

43:25.427 --> 43:27.327
