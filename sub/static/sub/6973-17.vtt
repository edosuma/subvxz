- [Scully Narrating]
Time passes in moments...
- [Water Dripping Rhythmically]

00:17.617 --> 00:19.778
Moments which rushing past...

00:19.853 --> 00:22.117
defne the path of a life...

00:22.188 --> 00:25.157
just as surely
as they lead towards its end.

00:26.326 --> 00:29.887
How rarely do we stop
to examine that path...

00:29.963 --> 00:33.126
to see the reasons
why all things happen.

00:33.199 --> 00:37.158
To consider whether the path
we take in life is our own making,

00:37.237 --> 00:40.729
or simply one into
which we drift with eyes closed.

00:42.008 --> 00:45.171
But what if we could stop,
pause to take stock...

00:45.245 --> 00:48.043
of each precious moment
before it passes?

00:48.114 --> 00:52.710
Might we then see the endless forks
in the road that have shaped a life?

00:52.786 --> 00:55.653
And seeing those choices,

00:55.722 --> 00:58.350
choose another path?

01:46.738 --> 01:49.673
- ##[Soft Rock]
- [Slides Shifting In Projector]

02:07.992 --> 02:10.984
[Man Speaking Over Music]
I see the storm has broken...

02:11.062 --> 02:13.860
in the middle of the night.

02:13.931 --> 02:16.900
Nothing left here for me.

02:16.968 --> 02:18.902
It's washed away.

02:20.204 --> 02:23.640
The rain pushes the buildings aside.

02:23.708 --> 02:27.508
- I got the lab to rush the results of...
- The sky turns...

02:27.578 --> 02:31.639
I said, I got the lab to rush
the results of the Szezesny
autopsy, if you're interested.

02:31.716 --> 02:35.345
- I heard you, Scully.
- Szezesny did indeed drown.

02:35.420 --> 02:40.653
But not as the result
of the inhalation of ectoplasm
as you so vehemently suggested.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.159
What else could she have
possibly drowned in?

02:43.227 --> 02:45.559
Margarita mix.

02:45.630 --> 02:49.157
Upchucked with about 40 ounces
of Corcovado Gold tequila, which...

02:49.233 --> 02:52.225
as it turns out, she and her friends
rapidly consumed in the woods...

02:52.303 --> 02:54.931
while trying to reenact
The Blair Witch Project.

02:55.006 --> 02:58.339
I think that demands a little deeper
investigation, don't you?

02:58.409 --> 03:00.343
No, I don't.

03:00.411 --> 03:04.142
Well, it doesn't matter,
'cause we got bigger fish to fry.

03:04.215 --> 03:07.048
Have a seat, Scully.
Check this out.

03:07.118 --> 03:11.054
- Is that beautiful or what?
- Crop circles, Mulder?

03:11.122 --> 03:13.886
Computer-generated crop circles.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.688
It's a fractal image predicted
by a computer program using data...

03:16.761 --> 03:20.094
of every known occurrence
of the phenomena over the past 40 years.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.258
What most people don't realize
is that since 1991...

03:26.337 --> 03:29.238
- [Slides Shifting]
- There's been a dramatic increase...

03:29.307 --> 03:31.400
in size and complexity
of circle designs.

03:31.476 --> 03:33.603
That's when the Mandlebrot Set
appeared in England...

03:33.678 --> 03:38.479
a series of geometrically perfect rings
appearing almost impossibly overnight...

03:38.549 --> 03:41.017
in a field near Cambridge.

03:44.288 --> 03:46.347
But that was merely prelude
of what was to come.

03:46.424 --> 03:49.450
Three years later in 1994,

03:49.527 --> 03:53.554
even more complex formations
occurred simultaneously...

03:53.631 --> 03:56.327
on opposite ends of the English
countryside with the Mandlebrot Set,

03:56.400 --> 03:59.096
where it's still there
at its center.

03:59.170 --> 04:03.732
Then in 1997, even more complex
formations occurred.

04:03.808 --> 04:06.971
And I'm not wearing
any pants right now.

04:10.248 --> 04:12.648
- Hmm?
- You're not listening.

04:12.717 --> 04:15.311
I am.

04:17.321 --> 04:19.653
I guess I just don't
see the point.

04:21.759 --> 04:24.387
The point is that a computer
program has shown us...

04:24.462 --> 04:28.262
that these are not just random
happenstance coincidental occurrences.

04:28.332 --> 04:31.961
And that same program has predicted
that in just 48 hours...

04:32.036 --> 04:35.699
even more complex formations are gonna
be laid down in a field near Avebury.

04:35.773 --> 04:39.800
Forty-eight hours, Scully,
but I wouldn't mind getting
there earlier, if you don't mind.

04:39.877 --> 04:43.313
- Getting where?
- England. I got two tickets
on a 5:30 flight.

04:43.381 --> 04:46.077
Mulder, I still have to go
over to the hospital and...

04:46.150 --> 04:48.516
finish the final paperwork
on that autopsy you had me do.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.554
And to be honest,
it's Saturday.

04:50.621 --> 04:54.352
And I wouldn't mind,
I don't know, taking a bath.

04:56.193 --> 04:59.128
- What the hell does that mean?
- What it means is that
I'm not interested...

04:59.196 --> 05:03.223
in tracking down some sneaky
farmers who happened to ace
geometry in high school.

05:04.902 --> 05:09.896
And besides, what could you
possibly get out of this?

05:09.974 --> 05:14.468
Or learn? I mean,
it's not even remotely FBI related.

05:18.816 --> 05:20.841
I'll just cancel your ticket.

05:23.654 --> 05:25.918
Thanks for lunch.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.517
Mulder.
Look, we're always running.

05:30.828 --> 05:32.921
We're always chasing
the next big thing.

05:34.599 --> 05:36.692
Why don't you ever
just stay still?

05:36.767 --> 05:39.258
I wouldn't know
what I'd be missing.

05:50.314 --> 05:52.248
My name is Dana Scully...

05:52.316 --> 05:56.184
and I was told I could
pick up a postmortem folder
for a Miss Szezesny here.

05:56.253 --> 05:58.187
It's for the FBI.

05:58.255 --> 06:00.382
Let's see. Oh.

06:14.305 --> 06:16.569
And just sign here, please.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.878
Thank you.

06:53.177 --> 06:55.805
Hi. Um, I was given
the wrong test results.

06:55.880 --> 07:00.317
This X ray marked D. Waterston
was in the envelope marked Szezesny.

07:00.384 --> 07:02.477
I was expecting autopsy results.

07:02.553 --> 07:06.922
I'm sorry.
They must have gotten switched.

07:11.328 --> 07:13.262
Sorry for the inconvenience.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.764
Thank you.

07:15.833 --> 07:19.792
Is the, um... Is the D. Waterston
that was on the X ray,

07:19.870 --> 07:21.997
is that a Dr. Daniel Waterston?

07:23.407 --> 07:25.898
Waterston, Waterston.
Yes, it is.

07:25.976 --> 07:29.036
Admitted yesterday,
coronary care unit, room 306.

07:31.082 --> 07:33.016
Thank you.

07:38.322 --> 07:41.621
[Man] I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.

07:41.692 --> 07:44.160
Everything appears to be
as it should,

07:44.228 --> 07:46.162
under the circumstances.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.061
So, don't worry.

07:48.132 --> 07:50.623
If you'd like, I could show you
the hospital cafeteria.

07:50.701 --> 07:53.636
Uh, I guess...
Yeah, okay.

07:55.806 --> 07:58.468
Are there phones down there too?
I need to make some phone calls.

07:58.542 --> 08:00.476
Yes.

- [Rhythmic Pinging]

08:44.655 --> 08:48.785
- [Beeping Resumes]
- Excuse me.
Can I help you with something?

08:48.859 --> 08:52.625
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Scully.
I was just in the hospital and...

08:52.696 --> 08:55.256
Can we step into the hallway?

08:55.332 --> 08:57.266
Yeah.

09:01.972 --> 09:06.238
I'm Dr. Waterston's cardiologist, Paul
Kopeikan. You say your name was Scully?

09:06.310 --> 09:08.244
Uh, yes, Dana Scully.

09:08.312 --> 09:12.146
- Dr. Waterston's mentioned you.
- I'm sorry. You must be mistaken.

09:12.216 --> 09:15.708
You were a student
of his, right?

09:15.786 --> 09:17.720
He has a heart condition?

09:17.788 --> 09:21.952
Dr. Waterston came in yesterday
with severe chest pains.

09:22.026 --> 09:25.154
And he ordered us to do
an echocardiogram...

09:25.229 --> 09:27.754
and a biopsy because
he'd had symptoms...

09:27.832 --> 09:30.232
of an upper respiratory
infection the week before.

09:30.301 --> 09:32.670
Fortunately, it was the right call.

09:32.803 --> 09:35.431
- Then it's serious.
- But treatable.

09:35.506 --> 09:38.134
- I have to wake him up soon
if you'd care to...
- No.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.006
That's all right.
But thanks for your time.

09:41.078 --> 09:43.239
He must have been
a wonderful teacher.

09:43.313 --> 09:46.771
I've been following his work on
constrictive pericarditis for years now.

09:46.850 --> 09:49.444
Yes.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.579
He's a remarkable man.

[Door Opening]

10:05.402 --> 10:07.802
[Ringing]

10:10.774 --> 10:13.937
- Hello?
- [Woman] You came to see him.

10:14.011 --> 10:16.138
I'm sorry.
Who is this?

10:16.213 --> 10:19.341
- Margaret Waterston.
- Maggie.

10:19.416 --> 10:21.407
Is everything all right?

10:21.485 --> 10:24.454
- Well, that depends, doesn't it?
- I'm sorry?

10:24.521 --> 10:29.652
Whatever. Dr. Kopeikan told my father you
were here, and now he wants to see you.

10:29.727 --> 10:32.127
- About what?
- Look.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.960
He asked me to call,
so I'm calling.

10:35.032 --> 10:38.763
I don't know, Maggie.
L-l... I don't know if I've got time.

10:38.836 --> 10:41.964
- Don't know if you have the time.
- [Line Beeps]

10:42.039 --> 10:45.839
- Maggie, can you hang on a second?
I have another call.
- Listen.

10:45.909 --> 10:49.970
It's your choice,
but if you come, it doesn't mean
I accept you being in his life.

[Phone Beeps]

10:54.485 --> 10:56.419
Hello?

10:56.487 --> 10:59.388
[Man On TV]
I'll never see you again.

10:59.456 --> 11:02.914
- Hello?
- Hey, you're there?

11:06.096 --> 11:09.497
- Hey.
- Mulder, aren't you supposed
to be on a plane?

11:09.566 --> 11:11.659
I got a 5:30 flight, remember?

11:11.735 --> 11:13.794
Right.
I guess I lost track of time.

11:13.871 --> 11:16.863
Listen, the reason I called...
Am I catching you at a bad time?

11:16.940 --> 11:19.340
No, I just walked in.
Why?

11:19.409 --> 11:23.345
There's this group in D.C.
That is researching crop circles,

11:23.413 --> 11:27.076
and they've got a totally
different set of coordinates
from the one I got already.

11:27.151 --> 11:29.619
- Mulder, I'm not going.
- I gotta ask you a favor.

11:29.686 --> 11:31.950
One of the researchers lives
out near the hospital...

11:32.022 --> 11:35.958
and they've got these sensitive photos
and data and stuff that
they won't fax to me.

11:36.026 --> 11:39.291
So I was wondering if you would
go over there and, you know,

11:39.363 --> 11:41.797
and get it and put it in...
[Voice Fades]

11:41.865 --> 11:44.299
[Soft Banging]

11:46.804 --> 11:49.068
Speak to me, Scully.

11:49.139 --> 11:51.937
I'm out for the evening, Mulder.

11:52.009 --> 11:56.139
- Well, why didn't you just
say so in the first place?
- Look.

11:56.213 --> 11:59.080
Why don't you leave that address
on my answering machine...

11:59.149 --> 12:01.208
and, uh, I'll try it for you.

[People Chattering]

12:22.873 --> 12:25.637
I'm sorry.
L... I have the wrong room.

12:25.709 --> 12:28.007
That's okay.

13:18.428 --> 13:20.521
Hi.

13:20.597 --> 13:25.796
Do I have to lock eyes with the devil
for you to grace me with your presence?

13:25.869 --> 13:28.702
Surely not the devil.

13:32.643 --> 13:35.009
How are you feeling, Daniel?

13:35.078 --> 13:38.809
It's a real drag when the body
doesn't wanna play anymore.

13:38.882 --> 13:42.113
You're extremely lucky
you called that diagnosis.

13:42.185 --> 13:44.210
Luck has nothing to do
with it, Dana.

13:44.288 --> 13:47.257
That's what doctors do every day.
You may have forgotten that.

13:47.324 --> 13:48.985
Daniel.

13:53.964 --> 13:57.422
So, how did you happen
to be here in Washington?

13:58.502 --> 14:00.766
That's a long story.

14:21.825 --> 14:26.319
- How's the FBI?
- Is that why you wanted to see me?

14:26.396 --> 14:29.763
To remind me once again
what a bad choice I made?

14:34.037 --> 14:38.235
Believe me, my motivation
is far more selfish than that.

14:40.644 --> 14:42.737
You scare me, Daniel.

14:42.813 --> 14:44.747
I know.

14:46.883 --> 14:49.545
I scare you...

14:49.619 --> 14:52.986
because I represent
that which is ingrained,

14:53.056 --> 14:56.548
not only in your mind,
but in your heart...

14:56.626 --> 14:59.117
that which you secretly long for.

15:01.031 --> 15:02.965
You never accepted
my reason for leaving.

15:03.033 --> 15:05.797
It wasn't a reason.
It was an excuse.

15:06.903 --> 15:09.167
But you understood why.

15:10.374 --> 15:13.434
I can't believe
the FBI is a passion.

15:13.510 --> 15:15.774
Not like medicine.

15:18.081 --> 15:20.413
I'm sorry I came.

15:25.822 --> 15:29.121
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

15:31.995 --> 15:34.793
I know how difficult
it must have been for you,

15:34.865 --> 15:37.425
just walking through that door.

15:39.202 --> 15:41.762
But you wouldn't have come
if you didn't want to.

15:43.006 --> 15:45.600
That says something,
doesn't it?

16:02.292 --> 16:04.226
[Cell Phone Ringing]

16:05.896 --> 16:08.524
- Scully.
- [Mulder] I was just about
to leave you a message.

16:08.598 --> 16:12.329
I got that address that
I wanted you to go to for me.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.461
It's a woman you're
gonna be dealing with.

16:14.538 --> 16:17.598
She's affiliated with
American Daoist Healing Center.

16:17.674 --> 16:22.008
- She researches crop circles?
- Don't roll your eyes, Scully.

[Buzzing]

17:28.242 --> 17:31.439
Hi. I'm... You were...

17:31.512 --> 17:33.480
- At the hospital today.
- Right.

17:33.547 --> 17:35.674
That's strange.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.981
I'm Agent Scully.
I'm here on behalf of my partner.

17:39.053 --> 17:43.490
- About my research.
- For the FBI, as odd as that may sound.

17:43.557 --> 17:47.357
- I'm Colleen Azar.
Would you like to come in?
- No, thank you. I'm...

17:47.428 --> 17:50.124
- I think I need some fresh air.
- Are you all right?

17:50.197 --> 17:55.294
Yes, l... I mean, yes, l...
I'm just a little shaken.

17:55.369 --> 17:58.668
A near car accident, I think.
It's nothing, really.

17:58.739 --> 18:01.333
A car accident isn't nothing.

18:01.409 --> 18:04.207
- I'm sorry?
- In my experience,

18:04.278 --> 18:07.304

40:56.709 --> 41:00.008
Nothing. There was no event,
no crop circles.

41:00.079 --> 41:03.242
- Big waste of time.
- [Sighs]

41:04.717 --> 41:07.345
Maybe sometimes nothing happens
for a reason, Mulder.

41:07.420 --> 41:09.786
What is that supposed to mean?

41:09.855 --> 41:12.187
Nothing.

41:12.258 --> 41:14.658
Come on.
I'll make you some tea.

41:16.762 --> 41:20.095
[Mulder]
I just fnd it hard to believe.

41:20.166 --> 41:24.967
- What part?
- The part where I go away for
two days, your whole life changes.

41:25.037 --> 41:27.130
I didn't say
my whole life changed.

41:27.206 --> 41:31.233
You speaking to God in
a Buddhist temple. God speaking back?

41:31.310 --> 41:33.505
Now, I didn't say
that God spoke back.

41:33.579 --> 41:36.844
I said that I had
some kind of a vision.

41:36.916 --> 41:40.647
Well, for you that's like saying
you're having David Crosby's baby.

41:45.891 --> 41:48.325
What is it?

41:48.394 --> 41:51.090
I once considered spending
my whole life with this man.

41:54.033 --> 41:56.297
What I would have missed.

41:57.370 --> 41:59.361
I don't think you can know.

41:59.438 --> 42:03.204
I mean, how many different lives
would we be leading if we
made different choices?

42:03.275 --> 42:05.607
We... We don't know.

42:07.380 --> 42:09.974
What if there was
only one choice...

42:12.952 --> 42:15.147
and all the other ones
were wrong...

42:16.956 --> 42:20.119
and there were signs along the way
to pay attention to?

42:21.727 --> 42:24.423
Then all the... choices...

42:24.497 --> 42:27.762
would then lead
to this very moment.

42:29.001 --> 42:31.936
One wrong turn and...

42:32.004 --> 42:34.131
we wouldn't be sitting
here together.

42:34.206 --> 42:36.470
Now, that says a lot.

42:37.476 --> 42:39.410
It says a lot, a lot, a lot.

42:39.478 --> 42:43.574
I mean, it's probably more
than we should be getting
into at this late hour.

44:35.393 --> 44:37.327
[Child]
I made this!

44:38.305 --> 44:44.863
