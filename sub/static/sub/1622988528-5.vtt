02:50.754 --> 02:54.216
Prof, this is amazing,
and it's only the tip of the iceberg.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.885
-There's plenty more just waiting for us.
-What did you do?

02:56.969 --> 02:59.263
Look, whatever it is, I need you to stop.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.597
Listen, listen, listen. There--

03:00.681 --> 03:02.975
There's a story in here
about a father and his two sons.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.977
I'm pretty sure it's the prequel
to The Coaster's Daughter

03:05.060 --> 03:06.603
he talked about one time on NPR.

03:06.687 --> 03:10.148
It's fantastic.
When-- When people read this--

03:10.232 --> 03:11.275
Where did you get it?

03:13.068 --> 03:15.612
She gave it to me. Easy as pie.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.949
Told you I was good at persuading people.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.909
You didn't do anything to her, did you?

03:22.286 --> 03:23.412
What?

03:23.495 --> 03:24.621
You didn't hurt her?

03:25.497 --> 03:27.499
-No, I never laid a finger on her.
-Good.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.002
Good, that's good.
Look, I need you to stop.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.171
I changed my mind. Just leave her alone.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.424
Well, I can't do that, prof. This is
too important. The world is waiting.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.217
Jim, I need you to--

03:51.899 --> 03:53.483
Hey.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.486
I loved you.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.488
Talk to me.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.243
Where are you?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.168
Talk to me, okay?

04:13.629 --> 04:15.422
Do you wanna come home?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.966
Squeeze my hand.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.525
Help me.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.986
Help me! Help me!

05:55.689 --> 05:57.107
Oh, Scott.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.028
You buried your brother by yourself.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.865
You buried him alone.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.706
I need to know one more thing.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.126
I need to know about your brother.

06:16.752 --> 06:19.880
And then-- And then we're never
gonna talk about this ever again.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.216
You think that Daddy murdered Paul?

06:24.718 --> 06:29.932
You know, you think that's how
the story of the good brother ends.

06:30.474 --> 06:35.062
Well, they would've called it
murder if he'd ever been tried for it.

06:36.939 --> 06:41.109
You know, in the end,
after all the… beatings

06:41.985 --> 06:47.366
and the cutting and the crazy,
my daddy showed him love.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.076
Mercy.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.247
Because that's what it was. Not murder.

06:54.665 --> 06:55.874
Release.

06:57.709 --> 07:02.589
Paul was in the bad. I don't know
if it's from when the long boy hurt him

07:02.673 --> 07:07.469
or just from our fucked up Landon
heritage, but he was in the bad too much.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.347
Too much for Daddy to cut and let it out.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.267
And when it happened, it happened fast.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.364
Boys.

07:31.702 --> 07:32.703
Landons.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.748
Get your asses down here.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.880
The devil delights
in the sins of the flesh…

07:42.963 --> 07:44.965
-Help me with this shit.
-…the way pig delights in the wallow!

07:45.048 --> 07:46.967
-Quit fuckin' around.
-Can I get a hallelujah?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.635
-Can I get an amen?
-What are you doing?

07:48.719 --> 07:50.095
-Amen!
-Thank you.

07:50.179 --> 07:53.015
-What's so important?
-Now, heaven is within your grasp,

07:53.098 --> 07:54.975
but hell is waiting to swoop you under.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.810
I like it kind of--

07:57.603 --> 07:58.854
Heaven awaits…

08:01.064 --> 08:02.482
Daddy, help!

08:07.321 --> 08:10.324
Daddy! Daddy, help! Daddy!

08:10.407 --> 08:12.951
Paul's got the bad! Daddy, please!

08:13.035 --> 08:16.288
-Hey! What the hell is going on?
-Daddy!

08:16.371 --> 08:20.667
-…3 revivals coming up.
-Paul's got the bad! Daddy! Daddy, help!

08:20.751 --> 08:22.753
-Let me go!
-Daddy, Daddy!

08:41.230 --> 08:42.523
Infected.

08:45.817 --> 08:46.985
There at the bite.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.823
That's the bad in you now.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.826
It's running through your blood
and all along through your anatomy and…

08:57.204 --> 08:58.455
you're fucked.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.168
May I remind you…

09:19.643 --> 09:20.644
Here we go.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.272
Pick his leg up.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.758
Well, he's out right now, but--

09:51.842 --> 09:55.846
Well, not out for long. Goddamn.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.287
And you didn't call anybody?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.664
You didn't call a doctor or an ambulance--

10:22.748 --> 10:23.874
Are you kidding?

10:25.250 --> 10:29.713
Like, doctors, police, social services,

10:29.796 --> 10:33.884
all part of his international Jewish,

10:33.967 --> 10:37.471
fascist, Christian, communist conspiracy.

10:39.556 --> 10:44.520
Daddy said that even the people he worked
with in the factory were in on it.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.979
We were alone.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.274
Alone was all we knew.

10:51.527 --> 10:52.694
What did you do?

10:56.031 --> 10:57.241
We trussed him up.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.037
Like a hog in a pen.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.962
"I know what I'm doing."

11:11.505 --> 11:12.965
"I know what I'm doing."

11:16.468 --> 11:17.469
He didn't.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.180
He was only guessing.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.685
But I understood the truth of it.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.229
What was the truth?

11:28.647 --> 11:29.815
He loved him.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.777
He loved us both.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.074
You know, and he was
just doing his duty as a father.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.120
It was ugly love, but it was strong.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.707
True.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.715
You are as dumb as you are ugly.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.677
I swear to God, if you didn't have
that fucking birthmark on your ass,

12:40.761 --> 12:43.347
I would say
you were the exterminator's kid.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.973
Your mother always liked him.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.561
Your mother was a whore,
but I loved her anyway.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.230
She was my whore.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.066
Don't shoot him.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.656
Get with the goddamn program, soldier.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.116
That ain't your brother anymore.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.370
Does it look like him?
Look at his goddamn eyes.

13:08.121 --> 13:12.084
Eyes are blazing like a goddamn wild boar.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.378
You know what
he's got living inside of him?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.713
You know what's going through
his goddamn veins?

13:17.923 --> 13:20.467
You know what it looks like?
Looks like this.

13:21.677 --> 13:25.514
Mud. He's got mud and blackness
running through his veins.

13:29.393 --> 13:30.394
He--

13:32.062 --> 13:33.605
He don't feel anything.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.191
He don't feel anything.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.028
He got the bad in him.
He don't feel a goddamn thing.

13:40.112 --> 13:43.198
Would you try to teach--
teach him something.

13:43.699 --> 13:44.908
I don't want him gone.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.785
You don't listen, you don't--

13:49.746 --> 13:52.165
Scooter, get over here.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.005
No, don't do that.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.299
Scoot. Scoot, don't do that.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.719
Open your eyes! Open them!

14:06.930 --> 14:08.974
Don't you-- Don't do it.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.477
Don't you start crying now.
Don't you dare.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.606
Listen, I--
I'm gonna start crying. Just stop.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.108
Listen to me.

14:19.109 --> 14:22.112
Listen--
You know the bad? You know the bad?

14:22.196 --> 14:25.908
The bad and the other place?
And the gone and all of that?

14:25.991 --> 14:28.702
It's a curse, okay? It's the Landon curse.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.621
It's a curse, but it's also a blessing.

14:31.163 --> 14:34.082
So those-- those who focus
just on the curse,

14:34.166 --> 14:37.794
they get bad and then they're gone
and they never come back.

14:39.296 --> 14:44.468
But those who see the blessing,
they go on and on and on and on.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.054
They live on even after they're gone.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.767
And then when you're gone,
you're-- you're not gone.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.685
You're-- You're remembered.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.939
Which one are you gonna be, huh?

15:34.059 --> 15:35.185
It was enough.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.066
For three weeks, it was enough.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.778
And that's where
my brother spent his last fall.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.281
The last weeks of his life.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.617
In that stinking barn.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.205
You can't imagine those three weeks.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.002
Especially when Daddy was at work
and it was just me and Paul.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.128
He went to work?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.588
We had to eat.

16:03.338 --> 16:04.923
You know, and pay for the electric.

16:05.924 --> 16:09.720
And we couldn't afford for people
to get suspicious about Daddy, be--

16:10.846 --> 16:12.389
People didn't like him.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.057
I'm not surprised.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.934
I told him to cut him.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.317
Let out the bad, like he always did.

16:23.400 --> 16:28.197
But he said it wouldn't do any good
because the bad had gone into his brain.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.452
And then one day,

16:33.535 --> 16:35.454
when Daddy was gone…

16:37.497 --> 16:38.707
Scotty.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.877
Hey, Scotty.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.676
Let me loose.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.180
Please.

16:55.516 --> 16:56.850
I'll make you a bool hunt.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.228
A good bool.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.522
The best bool.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.777
Sixty clues, Scotty. Sixty!

17:07.528 --> 17:10.739
It'll be the best, longest bool hunt ever.

17:15.661 --> 17:18.579
A candy bar and an RC.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.085
Come on.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.217
Just let me loose.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.054
He's crazy. You know he is.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.516
It's all in his head.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.560
I'm fine.

17:40.519 --> 17:41.645
I'm good.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.233
Just let me out. Come on!

17:47.860 --> 17:49.403
Please.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.492
What would she think of you?

17:55.576 --> 17:59.246
What would Mom think of you if she knew
what you're doing to me right now?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.375
What would she say?

18:10.591 --> 18:11.675
Come on, Scott.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.179
I'm not your brother?

18:16.889 --> 18:18.098
Just an animal.

18:27.482 --> 18:31.069
What did I tell you he'll do
if he started talking to you?

18:31.862 --> 18:33.071
Unzip my guts.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.783
Unzip your guts, that's right.
That's right.

18:36.867 --> 18:40.996
You know that snake's trying to hypnotize
you right now, you little stupid bird!

18:42.247 --> 18:43.457
What else did I say?

18:46.293 --> 18:49.129
I said, "Put your fingers in your ears."
Now do it.

18:49.213 --> 18:52.716
Come on, Scotty, let me out.
Get over here right now.

18:53.175 --> 18:56.762
And you say, "You gone-bad fuck,
I can't hear you. I can't hear--"

18:56.845 --> 18:58.805
-I can't hear you.
-Do it again.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.098
I can't hear you.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.308
You understand what I'm saying?

19:01.391 --> 19:03.560
I didn't mean it. I love you, Scotty.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.314
You know I do. You know I love you.

19:08.732 --> 19:12.986
I guess it's feeding time, huh?
For the monster.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.114
Pioneer drumstick, can we?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.575
You know the price of meat right now?

19:18.659 --> 19:21.411
What do you think,
I'm just made of money?

19:22.538 --> 19:23.539
No, Daddy.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.829
I knew we couldn't save him at home.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.210
I said I-I-I have to.

21:34.461 --> 21:38.799
Holding on to Paul. That's the only way
I could take him to the pool.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.094
Booya Moon.

21:42.845 --> 21:44.429
The way you took me.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.103
Not too much, Daddy.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.234
Really gonna sleep with that one.

21:58.652 --> 22:01.488
You know, we got to keep control
of the situation, Scoot.

22:03.282 --> 22:04.283
Yeah.

22:05.409 --> 22:08.203
You cannot lose control.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.673
Got your favorite here, Paulie,

22:19.756 --> 22:22.718
pioneer drumstick,
just how Daddy used to make them.

22:24.469 --> 22:27.890
You don't need too much.
You know the price of meat right now?

22:29.516 --> 22:30.726
Everything's going up.

22:32.019 --> 22:34.021
It's part of the apocalypse, you know.

22:35.689 --> 22:36.607
Rest in peace.

22:48.327 --> 22:51.163
Come on now. You'll sleep like a baby.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.428
Mother--

23:11.892 --> 23:13.101
Give me that.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.524
First you need to turn on the water.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.943
-Why the hell do you have to do--
-It makes it easier.

24:03.527 --> 24:04.528
I don't wanna know.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.904
Paul showed me
like you showed me the tea cure.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.532
Even if he'd go,
he had to look at the water.

24:09.283 --> 24:11.285
Doing that made him think about the pool.

24:11.869 --> 24:13.912
The one in Booya Moon,
where all the broken people--

24:13.996 --> 24:16.498
Listen. I said I don't wanna know.

24:17.624 --> 24:23.213
All that matters is if he gets too close,
I want you to stick him, like this.

24:24.590 --> 24:28.635
Right into his neck. Okay?

24:35.934 --> 24:37.102
I love you, Daddy.

24:43.734 --> 24:47.279
I love you too, kiddo. I'm sorry.

24:49.615 --> 24:51.241
And he said if…

24:52.075 --> 24:54.536
If he didn't
rip off my head in the barn,

24:54.620 --> 24:57.289
then he definitely would
on the other side.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.166
That's what he-- he called it.

24:59.249 --> 25:01.460
And I said, "Well, what if,

25:02.169 --> 25:06.965
you know, Daddy just made enough of that
horse tranquilizer to make him woozy."

25:07.049 --> 25:08.258
Oh, my God.

25:08.926 --> 25:11.845
"Playing with fire there, Scoot," he said.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.850
I said, "I know.

25:17.434 --> 25:21.939
But we have to do something.
Before he breaks his chains."

25:24.775 --> 25:25.984
And so we tried it.

26:18.245 --> 26:19.246
Scoot!

26:21.123 --> 26:22.624
Come on, we're against time.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.043
Come on!

26:26.253 --> 26:28.547
Come on! What are you waiting for?

26:29.798 --> 26:31.133
I can't, Daddy.

26:32.718 --> 26:33.927
It's not working.

26:34.011 --> 26:35.012
Come on, Scooter!

26:59.203 --> 27:02.206
Scooter! Fuck, will you lie down?
I can't see anything!

27:03.874 --> 27:05.918
Will you get your hands
off my goddamn boy!

27:09.338 --> 27:10.631
Don't do it!

27:12.341 --> 27:15.135
You gone-bad son of--

30:04.763 --> 30:06.265
Daddy, come look.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.225
What do you want?

30:09.393 --> 30:10.394
Come look.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.156
Why does he not look like he did before?

30:24.366 --> 30:26.577
'Cause he's dead, Scooter, that's why.

30:26.660 --> 30:30.205
The bad's out of him now.
It left with that goddamn bullet.

30:32.082 --> 30:35.836
He's my firstborn.
And goddamn, he looks like your mother.

30:36.712 --> 30:38.755
They're gonna put me away
if they find him like this.

30:38.839 --> 30:41.675
Or in a state prison or nutbarn.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.052
I mean,
that's if they don't lynch me first.

30:44.595 --> 30:46.180
I can take him, Daddy.

30:47.723 --> 30:48.932
How can you take him?

30:49.433 --> 30:51.935
You gonna take him dead
but you couldn't take him alive?

30:54.897 --> 30:56.106
It's different now.

30:56.690 --> 31:01.236
He can't fight against it now.
Can't be an anchor. I know I can.

31:04.573 --> 31:06.116
Back up, Daddy.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.201
What'd you say to me?

31:08.118 --> 31:09.119
Back up.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.039
Scooter, have you lost your fucking mind?

31:12.122 --> 31:13.123
Back up!

31:14.333 --> 31:17.836
I dare you to say that one more time.
I triple-dog dare you.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.047
Say that to me again, I swear to God.

31:20.631 --> 31:21.673
Back up, Daddy!

32:07.636 --> 32:11.181
I took him over as easy as ever.

32:13.433 --> 32:14.476
When he was dead.

32:20.816 --> 32:26.154
You know, the dirt is soft around…

32:26.238 --> 32:28.115
sweetheart trees.

32:41.670 --> 32:43.338
So that's where I laid him.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.850
That's where I buried my brother.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.614
Why would you
make me remember all that?

33:56.787 --> 34:00.958
It's the silver shovel
that you saved him with.

34:01.708 --> 34:05.879
And he said that you would see it
even before you saw it.

34:06.964 --> 34:08.172
Did you?

34:09.632 --> 34:10.634
Yes.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.806
It's Am-- It's Amanda.

34:20.143 --> 34:22.271
It's not Dooley, it's Amanda.

34:23.772 --> 34:24.898
It's Am--

34:43.125 --> 34:46.628
So, when we talk about this trip,

34:47.129 --> 34:53.677
we can talk about how beautiful it was,
and the snow…

34:54.803 --> 34:56.889
how we had the place to ourselves.

34:58.015 --> 34:59.308
But the-- the other stuff,

34:59.933 --> 35:03.520
the stuff about your brother
and where we went, that never happened.

35:05.189 --> 35:06.982
Because I-- I can't deal with it.

35:08.609 --> 35:11.028
I mean, maybe that's
how your father felt too.

35:11.111 --> 35:14.448
Look, there's something
you have to understand about the pool.

35:14.531 --> 35:18.827
Every poet, artist, storyteller,
they go to the pool.

35:19.411 --> 35:22.998
It's dangerous,
but it also heals and renews.

35:23.081 --> 35:24.416
Like the human imagination.

35:24.499 --> 35:28.003
Great. I'll never have to ask you where
you get your ideas. Now can we drop it?

35:28.086 --> 35:29.505
-Sure.
-Forever?

35:30.047 --> 35:34.676
But if you ever need to go,
remember, water is best.

35:36.470 --> 35:37.471
Okay.

36:52.713 --> 36:54.339
It's very close, honey.

36:55.424 --> 36:57.009
I don't understand you.

36:59.136 --> 37:00.345
You know.

37:03.182 --> 37:05.225
It makes a sound.

38:21.969 --> 38:22.970
Scott.

38:24.263 --> 38:25.264
Scott.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.547
We're dancing.

39:00.966 --> 39:01.967
Remember?

39:16.940 --> 39:18.317
Squeeze my hand.

39:19.151 --> 39:21.236
Squeeze my hand if you wanna go home.

39:21.737 --> 39:23.614
You have to be quiet, lady.

39:24.114 --> 39:25.616
Or it might come.

39:29.453 --> 39:30.704
You have to help me.

39:31.705 --> 39:35.667
You have to help me.
We need to go back home.

39:36.376 --> 39:39.296
Be quiet. You'll bring it.

39:39.922 --> 39:41.465
What happened to you?

39:41.548 --> 39:42.758
Fight.

39:42.841 --> 39:44.009
How do you know?

39:45.552 --> 39:47.304
You need to go back.

39:50.140 --> 39:52.392
I don't think you belong here.

39:58.857 --> 39:59.858
I'm…

40:02.694 --> 40:03.904
thinking.

40:04.696 --> 40:08.116
No, you're not.
You don't need to be here.

40:08.742 --> 40:12.579
I don't think you wanna be here.
That's why you're a double.

40:13.705 --> 40:15.916
That's why you brought Good Ma's afghan.

40:15.999 --> 40:19.294
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able
to find you with all these people.

40:20.170 --> 40:21.588
You're a natural.

40:24.550 --> 40:27.886
Just close your eyes and go.

40:27.970 --> 40:29.137
Without you?

40:34.643 --> 40:35.686
I don't wanna be quiet.

40:50.367 --> 40:51.827
You need to go.

41:01.003 --> 41:02.462
I'm going back.

41:04.673 --> 41:06.341
Taking this with me.

41:07.426 --> 41:09.261
'Cause it's mine.

41:17.352 --> 41:18.896
What is that?

41:18.979 --> 41:19.980
I don't know.

41:24.318 --> 41:25.944
I don't wanna be here.

41:26.862 --> 41:28.113
It's okay.

41:32.034 --> 41:33.035
Paul!

41:52.971 --> 41:53.972
Scott!

41:54.598 --> 41:57.142
-Scott!
-Must be quiet. Let's go.

41:59.186 --> 42:00.187
It's your fault!

42:02.189 --> 42:04.566
Concentrate. Bring us home.

42:04.650 --> 42:05.776
You think you're famous.

42:06.735 --> 42:07.736
But you're not!

42:10.656 --> 42:13.116
It's the afghan. It's an anchor.

42:48.819 --> 42:50.529
You may think that there's a place.

42:50.612 --> 42:53.866
I know that I did
because Scott made me believe in it,

42:54.700 --> 42:57.536
but Booya Moon is not real.

42:59.162 --> 43:03.292
It's a place where Scott and his brother
pretended to go.

43:04.251 --> 43:08.380
Go, Paul. Go to Boolie Moon, or
whatever it is the hell you two call it.

43:09.298 --> 43:11.717
I-I could take him, Daddy.

43:12.843 --> 43:13.844
Oh, yeah?

43:14.386 --> 43:15.596
Yeah.

43:35.073 --> 43:39.328
I don't wanna be here.
Lisey, Lisey.

43:39.411 --> 43:41.997
But if you ever need to go, remember,

43:42.080 --> 43:43.415
water is best.

46:34.169 --> 46:37.047
Oh, Lisey. Be careful.
