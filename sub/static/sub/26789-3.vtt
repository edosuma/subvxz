01:50.819 --> 01:53.196
I never had sex
with a farm animal

01:53.279 --> 01:55.490
or abused a girlfriend,

01:55.573 --> 01:58.701
unless you count marrying her. Let me say, it was tough, uh...

02:01.996 --> 02:04.541
narrowing down
my ten most significant cases.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.418
I prefer the smaller questions.

02:07.627 --> 02:12.006
Of my professional memberships,
my teaching.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.801
Madam President, just between you and me,

02:14.884 --> 02:18.680
my feeling is that it's not as far-fetched
as some people say.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.934
I still think there is a universe

02:23.017 --> 02:25.687
where the ERA gets passed.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.066
Women truly are the best, aren't they?

02:35.280 --> 02:39.325
I am deeply honored to be considered
for the late Justice's seat.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.328
So, tell me.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.168
How did they buy you? The Shepherds.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.604
Judge Abruzzo, Madam President,
I hate to break this up.

02:50.628 --> 02:54.632
Oh, I have already taken too much
of the president's valuable time.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.342
Madam President.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.204
- Mr. Vice President.
- Your Honor.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.764
It has been a sincere pleasure.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.771
I'll set up Judge Michaels
for the end of the day tomorrow?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.592
I have Secretary Durant waiting for you. I felt emasculated.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.574
Excuse me.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.787
Bill Shepherd guiding my hand.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.707
And you looked emasculated, Mark.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.962
- You're mistaken.
- No, I'm not mistaken.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.607
- I watched your face.
- Madam President...

03:34.631 --> 03:36.466
Please don't call me that. Please.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.092
- Claire.
- Better.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.638
- Claire.
- Yes. What?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.321
That was not a fight you were gonna win.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.308
- Do you like being the messenger?
- What?

03:45.391 --> 03:47.810
Has it been a dream of some sort
since you were a little boy?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.354
Because I can tell you something.

03:49.437 --> 03:53.024
Once you identify the degree
to which you are boxed in,

03:53.107 --> 03:54.817
you'll see how liberating it is.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.361
Are you with me...

03:56.694 --> 03:58.696
or are you with those horrible,
horrible people

03:58.780 --> 04:00.156
you've attached yourself to?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.951
Because I can tell you something
about Bill Shepherd.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.452
I could smell it on him.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.830
The way I could on my father,
on my mother.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.791
He's sick.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.001
- Well, he was.
- He is.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.296
And then where will that leave you?

04:15.672 --> 04:16.505
With her?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.923
Annette Shepherd?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.676
I know what that woman is,

04:19.759 --> 04:22.845
and more to the point, <i>isn't</i> capable of.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.267
And that little encounter
with the honorable Judge Abruzzo

04:27.350 --> 04:29.894
at the fundraiser,
that was orchestrated too, wasn't it?

04:29.978 --> 04:30.978
Yes.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.193
I look at him sometimes
and imagine him at six years old.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.154
Was he always so deliberative?

04:40.238 --> 04:41.281
Cautious?

04:42.865 --> 04:44.450
And I think in another life...

04:45.118 --> 04:46.828
some other context

04:46.911 --> 04:48.663
might we have been friends.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.876
It's time to decide, Mark.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.547
<i>I hold every president
to the same standard.</i>

04:57.630 --> 05:00.049
<i>Are you making America better,</i>

05:00.133 --> 05:03.386
<i>or are you making America worse?</i>

05:03.469 --> 05:04.971
<i>That's all that matters...</i>

05:05.054 --> 05:06.907
Excuse me.
Could you turn this off, please?

05:06.931 --> 05:09.809
- Yes, sir.
- The level of discourse in this city.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.313
I'm telling you. She does have a point.

05:14.105 --> 05:17.233
You need to tell Duncan to be careful
when it comes to his pit bull.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.194
City.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.741
FDR turned this place into a city.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.786
With his agencies and armies of clerks.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.747
All the professors that followed.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.750
Before the war,
this was just a small Southern town.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.836
One built of marble, yeah, but just a...

05:37.295 --> 05:39.547
small town sitting on a swamp.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.341
Place to visit.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.633
Place to...

05:43.968 --> 05:45.470
protect the Republic.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.223
Secure States' rights.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.934
That's not what it is today.

05:52.310 --> 05:57.190
Some top-down money grab for bureaucrats,
lobbyists and the entire Democratic party.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.818
- You've always been more Teddy.
- Than that traitor pig Franklin?

06:01.152 --> 06:05.156
Look, I know it's a sacrifice for you
to be here, in Washington.

06:05.239 --> 06:08.284
But for God's sake,
why take the same room he was in?

06:08.659 --> 06:09.659
Well...

06:09.702 --> 06:11.704
Well, he wanted to keep an eye on her.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.958
Francis never could let go
of the White House.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.462
But he did give us the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.756
She's not qualified.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.384
She stole the damn thing.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.596
If ever there was ever a chance
to shrink the office down to size,

06:28.679 --> 06:31.057
it's the presidency of Claire Underwood.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.935
Maybe you should run for office.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.354
I think that time has passed.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.858
I'm worried about you.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.319
Oh, don't be.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.863
Never better.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.703
Deregulation bill
is the first of a hundred,

06:53.037 --> 06:54.622
ready and waiting.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.333
The speed you're moving at...

07:01.462 --> 07:04.298
I can come back.
The lawyers are due any minute.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.385
No, no. Come on in here.
Grab yourself a cup of something.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.179
I know Annette wanted to talk to you
in person,

07:10.263 --> 07:11.848
before the rest of the team arrives.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.392
I passed on what you told me
about the president.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.755
I want you to have it all before

07:15.810 --> 07:17.437
Duncan got his hands on it.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.939
She admitted
to all three of the abortions.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.234
But I can get you the names of the men.
Who they were.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.446
No, I'm not comfortable with this.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.823
Let's take that off the table for now.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.116
She'll play along.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.868
We'll make sure of it.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.172
I always imagined
that if I were president,

07:44.255 --> 07:46.799
I would want you to be a member
of my cabinet.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.303
You look like a movie star.

07:50.386 --> 07:54.265
Oh, well, it's the glare.
I get migraines since the fall.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.393
- They can come on quite suddenly.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.939
The vice president said that you wanted
to meet me in person.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.568
It's so good to see you.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
Sit.

08:11.824 --> 08:15.161
Not everyone comes back
from a fall like that, Cathy.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.329
Yes.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.165
I'm starting to feel
like a proverbial cat.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.211
Take off your glasses,
let me see your eyes.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.179
You have no shortage of stories.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.388
You know that.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.642
My memory's been very erratic lately.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.061
Sometimes, I think I might just forget

08:40.144 --> 08:44.190
the details of my time
in office altogether if...

08:45.274 --> 08:46.359
If?

08:48.778 --> 08:54.242
Honestly, I would love nothing more
than to just move on, Madam President.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.078
Well, I understand
that you have a job offer.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.330
Several. I'm lucky.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.458
The Eisenhower Strategic Initiative,
isn't it?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.378
Yes, a think tank makes sense.
Outside of government.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.129
Well, not entirely outside.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.714
And heavily funded by...

09:08.798 --> 09:12.552
A coalition of industrialists
and civic-minded folk, yes.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.845
Big plans to change the world.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.179
Hmm.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.350
I haven't accepted.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.685
But you want to.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.647
You think I shouldn't take the job?

09:24.939 --> 09:27.692
I think you should trust your gut, Cathy.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.820
Take care of yourself.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.700
Claire.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.163
I'm sorry I didn't write after Francis...

09:41.247 --> 09:43.082
Oh, there's no need to apologize.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.004
I can still feel his hand...

09:49.130 --> 09:50.298
on my back.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.051
Cathy, he's gone.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.850
Bill Shepherd got to her.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.603
I can feel it.Â She's going to testify.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.314
My lawyers tell me her team
is still negotiating,

10:06.397 --> 10:07.898
maybe for a while yet.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.234
She thinks she's safe with them,
with this job.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.194
Instead they're gonna be
sentencing her to...

10:17.950 --> 10:20.411
It needs to look like complications
from her fall.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.040
I can have her detail pulled.
I still know some people.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.417
The opportunity will present itself.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.673
One last piece
connecting us both to Francis.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.846
The world is either with us
or against us, Doug.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.277
You think you'll ever wear them?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.323
Doesn't feel right.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.200
Do you know the last thing he said to me?

10:59.867 --> 11:01.827
"Promise me you and Doug

11:02.495 --> 11:04.121
will take care of each other."

11:10.211 --> 11:14.882
I want to thank the National Gallery
for curating this magnificent exhibit.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.885
Our hope is, in due time,

11:17.968 --> 11:21.138
these works of art
will return to their rightful place

11:21.514 --> 11:25.351
in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.023
Mr. Nasser.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.818
They're making a fool of you,
these Shepherds.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.653
The special interests. The go-betweens.

11:35.736 --> 11:39.490
Your so-called peacekeeping in Syria
was a shameless land grab

11:39.573 --> 11:42.326
built on the lives of American soldiers
you sent into battle.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.330
Then you can blame Jane Davis, Mr. Nasser.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.414
I do.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.752
I had hoped to renegotiate the deal
Jane helped broker many months ago.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.755
Now I know that's impossible.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.425
Oh, because she's conveniently
unavailable.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.927
Because you're in no position to do so.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.929
You've been excluded,Â just as I have.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.806
They're stripping power from you.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.517
Have you ever seen the Baathist playbook?

12:07.101 --> 12:10.146
It was inspired by
American intelligence agencies.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.232
Sometimes, you need to be an insurgent
in your own country.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.035
Well, that's interesting.
Because presently,

12:15.067 --> 12:18.070
I'm meeting with a member
of a known terrorist organization.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.948
Pardon me. But I'm a lawyer.

12:21.031 --> 12:24.160
If you allow American corporate interests
to cut ICO out of Syria's future...

12:24.243 --> 12:26.829
Are you about to threaten me, Mr. Nasser?

12:26.912 --> 12:30.124
No, but we all know
what ICO is capable of.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.668
I'm merely conveying a message
from one of my clients.

12:33.043 --> 12:36.547
You and your client are one and the same.

12:38.841 --> 12:43.241
Americans have such faith in their ability
to keep things and people safe. Mr. Nasser, Syria is a country of...

12:50.978 --> 12:54.815
former schools, former homes,
former places of worship.

12:54.899 --> 12:58.277
Your organization played a large part
in the destruction.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.821
And so have you, Madam President.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.741
I'm afraid I can't help you.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.825
No...

13:07.244 --> 13:08.370
you can't.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.799
I got two daughters, a beautiful wife.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.884
Paid my dues.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.511
Four terms.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.765
A Republican in a diverse district.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.560
I got a ground operation second to none.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.020
And my volunteers,

13:33.103 --> 13:35.981
their sons and their daughters
are coming up right behind 'em. I just...

13:36.941 --> 13:38.442
I just feel like, um...

13:40.611 --> 13:41.971
this could be my moment, you know?

13:43.030 --> 13:45.311
Fred told me about the legislation
about to be introduced.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.366
Mm-hmm.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.119
I'm co-signing.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.330
- It's...
- Ambitious.

13:52.706 --> 13:53.999
It's unprecedented.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.252
It's bipartisan, is what it is.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.837
You worked for her.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.422
I worked for her husband.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.759
Nobody wants her hands
on a nuclear football.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.929
Or sending any more uniforms anywhere,
here or abroad.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.099
You're gonna have to be okay with that.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.516
Are you?

14:13.435 --> 14:14.728
I owe her nothing.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.228
So what do they have on you?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.072
Hold on, slugger.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.424
I'm still trying to get acquainted here.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.581
- Right.
- Where do you think you're going?

14:34.123 --> 14:35.749
Fred Amburg asked me to meet you.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.252
- Well, Fred asked me to meet you.
- And we've met.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.089
Where do you get off?

14:42.923 --> 14:45.843
- After where you've been.
- You mean where I was.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.511
With Mr. Amburg.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.179
The last person you worked for...

14:49.263 --> 14:51.682
Became the President of the United States.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.101
He pushed you out.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.314
I am your chance.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.110
You know, not that I have
to prove myself to you,

15:03.193 --> 15:04.361
or to anyone else,

15:05.195 --> 15:06.906
but I can find the opening,

15:08.490 --> 15:10.701
the crack, the weak spot.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.536
I don't know,

15:13.162 --> 15:15.623
maybe it's a curse
to know what people fear.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.208
Like you.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.086
I think what scares you, Congressman.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.880
Your base,

15:22.963 --> 15:25.049
your ground game, all that love.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.051
You thought you deserved it,

15:27.676 --> 15:30.054
that it was meant for youÂ and nobody else.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.930
You got blind.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.142
You forgot that they'd come for you.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.686
But they will come.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.230
That's how this business is built.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.735
So, I'm going to ask you again.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.113
What is it that they have on you?

15:53.911 --> 15:56.580
My district covers O'Hare.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.624
Pensions.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.962
The baggage handlers. I...

16:06.924 --> 16:08.133
Shit. It was stupid.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.598
Well...

16:16.350 --> 16:18.686
it's only stupid
if you can't make it go away.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.276
Tom, calm down.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.445
I'm getting too old to be polite.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.031
Hear the deal out.
Content will not be changed.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.325
And you and I both know better.

16:34.868 --> 16:37.830
Something happened that night.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.540
Their marriage was broken,

16:39.832 --> 16:40.958
he went over there.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.626
I'm not saying they're connected,

16:42.710 --> 16:45.004
but the next day he winds up dead.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.839
She knew an indictment was coming.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.550
Do you understand what that means?

16:49.633 --> 16:50.634
Then keep writing.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.054
So they can turn it into a 140 characters
for clickbait?

16:54.138 --> 16:56.098
We don't write anymore,

16:56.181 --> 16:57.975
we come up with feed for the trough.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.769
Put that goddamn thing down
before I smash it!

17:00.853 --> 17:02.980
You need to go back in there

17:03.063 --> 17:04.481
and apologize.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.401
To whom, Dayna?

17:08.068 --> 17:12.196
Our new boss is a voice on a speakerphone!

17:12.614 --> 17:14.282
He doesn't even know I walked out.

17:15.325 --> 17:19.829
Why don't we write
about how Gardner Analytics

17:19.913 --> 17:21.498
is buying up television stations

17:21.582 --> 17:24.462
and some of the greatest papers
in this country? "Analytics." Oh, my God.

17:27.963 --> 17:31.050
What the fuck does that even mean?

17:34.386 --> 17:36.180
According to the autopsy,

17:36.764 --> 17:38.015
natural causes.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.142
Heart attack?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.311
Overdose of his liver medication.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.813
Accidental, presumably.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.736
- What aren't you telling me?
- Nothing.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.615
He would never do that intentionally.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.285
Witnesses in the lobby
of the Hay-Adams that night

17:58.368 --> 18:01.080
said the former president
was acting disoriented.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.373
Did you share this with his widow?

18:03.457 --> 18:05.375
She's the one
who asked me to look into it.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.128
She suspects the Shepherds.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.297
He was with them a lot,
but not that night.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.383
- And who was?
- Other than her?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.805
That was her husband, Doug.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.265
She's the president.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.519
Don't you sound devoted, Nathan.

18:23.602 --> 18:27.022
My only contact with her
is in my official capacity.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.234
Did you think you'd seen the last of me?

18:32.402 --> 18:34.196
That's the last thing I thought.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.242
I'll take that as a compliment.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.496
Doug, here.

18:44.873 --> 18:48.168
I tracked his comings and goings
back to when he left the White House.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.506
I got my hands on the metadata going
into his computer.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.095
LeAnn Harvey's camera phone
was streaming during the crash.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.182
A direct feed to only one IP address.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.934
Francis'.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.269
His laptop.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.397
It's not easy to watch, but...

19:09.857 --> 19:12.067
- Okay.
- Up to you.

19:26.623 --> 19:27.916
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.044
Duncan Shepherd.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.464
I'm sorry I couldn't be
at the meeting in person this afternoon.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.015
My walker drops him off when it's late.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.184
Come.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.357
You saw my little outburst.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.652
I enjoyed it.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.946
The outrage.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.531
We need more of it.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.242
I especially liked your appearance
on television the other night.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.620
Yeah. Well...

20:05.370 --> 20:07.039
I get a little heated sometimes.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.750
It's exactly the kind of exposure
the <i>Herald</i> needs.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.920
Tom,

20:13.962 --> 20:15.881
you're now part of a conglomerate

20:15.964 --> 20:17.966
with vast influence and reach.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.015
The point is I can bring you
whatever evidence you need.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.559
- Hold on.
- Divorce for pardon.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.103
There's a kernel of truth to it,
but your source...

20:32.189 --> 20:34.691
And before you say anything,
consider what I'm offering.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.735
An opportunity for justice.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.780
If you're talking about
manufacturing evidence, Mr. Shepherd,

20:39.863 --> 20:42.157
- I'm not interested.
- Beg to differ.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.868
And spare me the seasoned
journalist routine, please.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.870
Your 30 years in the business.

20:47.621 --> 20:51.141
I've spoken to your old assistant, Angela. She's written a piece
about her time with you.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.086
I could run it, or...

20:56.630 --> 20:59.174
Your dogged pursuit of Frank Underwood,
pardon the pun,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.051
is now your pursuit of his bride.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.534
Hmm.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.723
Think about it.

21:07.849 --> 21:12.312
Men your age,
they unravel very easily these days.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.860
<i>Judge Vincent Abruzzo has the credentials.</i>

21:18.944 --> 21:21.154
<i>The published writings,
the public statements.</i>

21:21.238 --> 21:23.615
<i>It all checks out. Full package.</i>

21:23.699 --> 21:26.243
<i>So what's the hesitation, Madam Prez?</i>

21:26.618 --> 21:29.371
Beltway Television is owned
by Gardner Analytics.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.581
It's the latest brainchild
of Duncan Shepherd.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.626
So far, I've deflected all questions
regarding Ms. Cruz's commentary.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.878
Good. Let's not dignify it.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.514
No. That's fine, thank you.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.019
They were a hazard, I couldn't resist.

21:54.187 --> 21:57.149
Sorry I missed the funeral.
Were there psalms?

21:57.232 --> 21:58.817
Number 42.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.444
I love 42.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.700
Nasser had no business
coming to you directly.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.704
Well, I knew if I met with him,
you'd suddenly appear.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.914
He feels lied to, Jane.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.458
Because he was.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.170
We were never gonna give those bandits
a seat at the table.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.465
Jane, he's threatened more ICO attacks.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.009
ICO is neutralized, mostly.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.845
It's time to re-think our involvement
in Syria.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.388
Stand down, rebuild.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.059
This deal is important for all of us.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.977
Including the Shepherds.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.355
Look, I'm no fan of that family,

22:36.980 --> 22:40.484
but in the case of Syria,
our interests align.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.985
The next phase of our...

22:42.319 --> 22:43.653
presence in the region

22:44.613 --> 22:47.282
is more about the spoils than the peace.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.534
The problem is Petrov,

22:49.618 --> 22:51.536
whom the Shepherds and I despise.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.080
What do you have on the Shepherds?

22:54.164 --> 22:57.876
I'm sure one of the several agencies
you're involved with has something.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.879
And don't you keep files
on everyone you're dealing with?

23:01.546 --> 23:03.507
Bill and Annette are very careful.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.425
What about Annette's son, Duncan?

23:07.344 --> 23:09.763
Well, Mark knows them more than I do.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.895
I thought there were better options
for a former president...

23:18.647 --> 23:20.649
but Annette wouldn't leave Frank alone.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.569
That's their problem,
they don't know when to stop.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.741
You know, when you left three months ago,
I wondered where you'd gone.

23:31.326 --> 23:34.704
And then, I didn't think of you at all.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.916
You say that.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.962
But I detect pain in your eyes,
Madam President.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.426
As a deer longs for streams of water.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.886
So I long for you, God.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.347
Do you miss him?

23:54.057 --> 23:56.226
God? Always.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.110
I'd like you to move in here with me,
Jane, into the White House.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.987
I need your counsel

24:07.612 --> 24:10.407
and your perspective
when it comes to Mark.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.455
The truth is that whole last year
in the White House...

24:17.998 --> 24:19.416
I just lost myself.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.671
And the crazy thing is,
I've never even met Zoe Barnes.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.257
Is that what you told the US Attorney?

24:27.340 --> 24:29.759
Or did you and Claire Underwood
make a deal?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.887
The president and I
are on different paths.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.723
You're saying you haven't seen her.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.600
We've spoken.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.811
I just don't see a role for me
in her White House.

24:42.230 --> 24:43.732
I'm working with Congressman Cole.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.319
He's making a play for speaker.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.445
Hmm.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.660
I left the <i>Herald</i> today.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.248
If that's why you wanted to see me,

25:00.332 --> 25:02.334
- make a pitch for your new guy.
- No.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.961
No, this is about making amends.

25:05.378 --> 25:06.922
Last fall I started drinking again.

25:07.005 --> 25:07.839
No.

25:07.923 --> 25:11.176
You picked this place because
it's full of bloggers and Hill rats.

25:11.635 --> 25:16.306
Right now, everyone here can see us
talking together, like civilized people.

25:16.389 --> 25:18.850
As if I never called you a murderer
in print.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.689
Your latest article on Francis.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.522
This story about the nights leading up
to his death?

25:27.567 --> 25:29.407
You want to make amends? Who are your sources?

25:31.154 --> 25:32.239
Peter Russo.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.449
Zoe Barnes.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.243
LeAnn Harvey.

25:40.247 --> 25:45.293
Doug, there isn't a shadow
for you to hide in anymore.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.338
The only person knows everything is you.

25:48.922 --> 25:49.923
I don't.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.510
Let him go.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.616
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.191
At some point,
you're gonna have to decide. Claire Underwood, believe me,

26:12.070 --> 26:14.114
she'll come for you when it's time.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.408
Thanks.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.924
You know, there's caffeine in that.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.010
I do.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.598
I love that you love Arnold Palmers, but...

26:40.265 --> 26:42.142
Arnold Palmer was a great man.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.354
She still on your mind?

26:51.151 --> 26:52.986
This arrangement isn't working.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.364
Which arrangement?

26:57.490 --> 26:58.700
Mark, come to bed.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.955
She needs to feel some degree of autonomy.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.582
Fuck autonomy.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.459
She serves at our pleasure.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.419
I'm sure she feels undervalued.

27:09.502 --> 27:10.629
Undervalued?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.756
Claire Hale? Please.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.411
What if Bill doesn't get better?

27:18.219 --> 27:19.512
He is better.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.432
If we don't play this right,

27:22.724 --> 27:24.893
in the public eye, we are doomed to fail.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.062
- You know that, right?
- She's doomed, you mean.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.897
Look...

27:30.023 --> 27:31.107
Let's be clear.

27:31.191 --> 27:35.111
I am not attracted to her,
but she needs to see me as a partner.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.447
And what is the rush?

27:38.865 --> 27:40.867
Bill wants a majority on the court.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.994
He's waited a long time.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.456
Let her at least look like the president.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.126
I'll scuttle the nomination
if it comes to that later.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.713
I want Judge Abruzzo, Mark.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.216
And don't ever question
my brother's ability

27:56.299 --> 27:58.385
to function at the highest level.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.181
What is that Sylvia Plath line?

28:04.140 --> 28:06.101
"She eats men like air."

28:06.184 --> 28:07.977
Who are we talking about?

28:17.612 --> 28:18.612
Hey.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.532
Sorry we missed each other yesterday.

28:20.615 --> 28:23.702
<i>Well, my apologies for leaving you
in the lurch again today.</i>

28:23.785 --> 28:24.828
Everything okay?

28:24.911 --> 28:26.204
I spoke to Annette.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.289
<i>I really think this is the best course.</i>

28:30.083 --> 28:32.502
- Did you ever meet George?
<i>- George?</i>

28:33.294 --> 28:36.464
My brother George. Incurious George.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.299
No, I never did.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.928
<i>And back in the old days,
we acquired an operation in the Midwest,</i>

28:42.011 --> 28:43.763
<i>refining Canadian crude.</i>

28:43.847 --> 28:45.932
<i>Profit margin was...</i>

28:46.015 --> 28:47.684
<i>It was staggering.</i>

28:47.767 --> 28:48.935
But George,

28:49.018 --> 28:51.563
he got all high-minded about it.

28:52.021 --> 28:56.359
Thought that we were
bending too many laws. So he...

28:56.693 --> 29:01.364
He bought a rival company,
green energy type, and he sued us.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.533
<i>Sued us.</i>

29:04.075 --> 29:05.118
<i>I mean...</i>

29:05.827 --> 29:07.078
The betrayal.

29:08.121 --> 29:11.958
My father's true religion was family.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.918
And he was troubled.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.796
He was deeply troubled
by what George had done.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.298
Changed his will.

29:19.132 --> 29:23.970
Any sibling bringing litigation
against any other at the time of his death

29:24.053 --> 29:26.598
would automatically lose their share
of the inheritance.

29:27.056 --> 29:28.892
Every damnable penny.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.519
He used that word.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.564
Which is exactly what happened to George.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.650
Oh. George couldn't believe it.

29:38.234 --> 29:43.281
Accused me of tricking Dad into doing it
when he was too weak to know his own mind.

29:43.364 --> 29:47.035
My father always knew his own mind.

29:47.911 --> 29:48.953
George...

29:50.830 --> 29:53.333
...he was just so broken up about it.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.378
Didn't even contest the will.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.088
Which as far as I see it,

29:59.172 --> 30:02.842
it means he had no place inheriting that
kind of money to begin with.

30:03.551 --> 30:06.596
<i>The man had everything he ever needed.</i>

30:07.138 --> 30:08.348
<i>He was just so...</i>

30:09.432 --> 30:10.809
Short-sighted.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.522
Lives on some island in Maine now.

30:16.272 --> 30:18.399
<i>You know what the worst part for me was?</i>

30:19.025 --> 30:20.944
<i>How much it upset Annette.</i>

30:22.445 --> 30:24.113
<i>That was a no-go.</i>

30:25.657 --> 30:27.283
<i>I'll get the nomination, Bill.</i>

30:28.618 --> 30:29.953
Bye-bye now, Mark.

30:37.710 --> 30:41.256
They were good enough to provide me
with a direct feed from the Hall.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.930
- Is this necessary?
- Inhale.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.936
- You ever seen Giselle?
- Mm-mm.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.846
Don't look at me like that.

31:03.611 --> 31:05.071
The results aren't all bad.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.243
<i>I'm being watched.</i>

31:10.618 --> 31:11.828
By whom?

31:12.161 --> 31:15.123
<i>Tom Hammerschmidt, the US Attorney.</i>

31:15.874 --> 31:18.167
<i>It's a feeling that I've had for a while.</i>

31:20.211 --> 31:21.254
Hello?

31:21.754 --> 31:22.755
<i>I'm here.</i>

31:24.924 --> 31:26.175
It's too risky.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.346
<i>If Francis had asked,
you'd have found a way.</i>

31:32.015 --> 31:33.016
That's true.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.310
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

31:36.519 --> 31:39.022
I guess this is where we part ways, Doug.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.399
It's for the best.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.318
<i>Then say goodbye.</i>

31:49.240 --> 31:51.284
You know what the last thing
he said to me was?

31:53.202 --> 31:55.830
"I can't imagine a world
with only one of you in it."

32:08.051 --> 32:11.262
There comes a point in every relationship
where you wonder,

32:11.596 --> 32:12.764
"Are you with me?"

32:15.892 --> 32:16.892
Are you?

32:18.561 --> 32:21.814
So, there are some loose ends
that Bill Shepherd is trying to exploit.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.191
One being...

32:23.566 --> 32:24.484
Cathy Durant.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.612
And I have known each other
for a very long time.

32:27.695 --> 32:28.821
I know.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.866
Well, the last time I saw Cathy,
she looked at death's door.

32:35.578 --> 32:37.458
You can't ask that of me. She trusts you, Jane.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.127
She trusts you.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.923
That's making a move in broad daylight.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.551
I enjoy having you here.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.642
I'll never be able to forgive myself.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.440
And when you told him about LeAnn?

33:04.524 --> 33:06.317
He showed no emotion, ma'am.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.987
- Where is he now?
- Still at home.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.155
I have a couple of agents trailing him.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.200
As far as the Bureau is concerned,
it's for Doug's own safety.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.283
Hmm.

33:16.244 --> 33:20.123
And besides Congressman Cole,
has he met with anyone?

33:20.206 --> 33:22.875
Other than myself, Tom Hammerschmidt.

33:26.629 --> 33:29.048
Perhaps you should be the one on him.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.884
In case we need to find him alone
at some point.

33:32.427 --> 33:35.263
I continue to be very concerned
about his state of mind.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.431
Yes, ma'am.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.982
Francis left him everything
in his handwritten will.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.068
Am I curious? Yes.

33:50.069 --> 33:53.322
But not enough to wait for Douglas Stamper
to bring me down.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.077
Secretary Durant,
Ms. Davis is in the back.

33:58.161 --> 34:01.039
- Where's Sal?
- He's off. My name is Giancarlo.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.498
It's a pleasure to meet you.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.625
Right this way.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.670
- Very slow today.
- Ah.

34:20.766 --> 34:21.766
Please.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.243
I'm sorry.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.246
- Madam Secretary, please.
- I'm sorry, I'm...

34:42.330 --> 34:43.664
Madam Secretary.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.522
- Hey.
<i>- Jane, how could you?</i>

35:07.605 --> 35:09.190
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

35:09.273 --> 35:11.210
- Listen to me, sweetheart.
<i>- No, you listen to me.</i>

35:11.234 --> 35:12.527
Is this Claire?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.612
Are you doing this for her?

35:14.695 --> 35:15.863
<i>Oh, Cathy.</i>

35:15.947 --> 35:18.241
<i>Once the decision is made,
you can't escape.</i>

35:18.324 --> 35:20.660
Maybe it won't happen today, but...

35:21.494 --> 35:22.787
someday,

35:22.870 --> 35:25.039
someday, I'm afraid.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.707
I curse you.

35:27.917 --> 35:32.338
I curse you and wish you a painful death.

35:32.922 --> 35:37.051
<i>Drawn out and excruciating.</i>

35:37.135 --> 35:38.886
I don't want to disappoint you.

35:39.428 --> 35:41.430
That's not how I'm gonna die.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.349
Well, we'll see.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.309
Will we?

36:14.839 --> 36:18.259
I've been thinking about the nomination.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.972
You should go with Abruzzo.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.108
We could get beaten up in the midterms

36:34.525 --> 36:36.777
if the wrong signals are sent.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.700
It's the way to be a two-term president.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.412
There's still a lot we can accomplish.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.583
You're such a strange animal.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.922
You've never been comfortable in your skin
since you've been vice president.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.799
Why did you even try?

37:03.179 --> 37:04.722
I believe in you.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.517
Well, that's not enough.

37:11.103 --> 37:12.647
I'll leave you to your movie then.

37:14.690 --> 37:16.817
What does Annette have to say
about all this?

37:19.570 --> 37:22.281
- I know you're close to her.
- I won't betray her.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.577
Just like I won't betray you, Claire.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.788
They got us, you know?

37:47.515 --> 37:48.933
We should make the announcement.

37:50.559 --> 37:51.727
Abruzzo.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.619
You can start the film.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.099
<i>She's already met
with the EPA Regional Administrator,</i>

38:54.123 --> 38:55.583
looking for memos.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.520
Hard disks have been scrubbed,
and there's nothing in the cloud.

38:58.544 --> 39:00.921
There's no paper trail,
virtual or otherwise.

39:03.215 --> 39:06.010
- Skorsky?
- She was with the <i>Herald.</i>

39:06.093 --> 39:07.678
She left when I joined the White House.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.930
It's just a local paper.
We can acquire it.

39:10.389 --> 39:12.391
This isn't about
the president grandstanding.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.393
She's talking to someone.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.314
- Duncan...
- We should save the app for the midterms.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.192
Well, do you trust
what you've built or not?

39:21.275 --> 39:22.485
I don't want it exposed.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.070
She signed up for the app.

39:24.153 --> 39:26.489
We can get into her phone,
take a look around.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.284
Would you gentlemen excuse us?

39:30.576 --> 39:32.870
No, stay. Bill.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.296
She wants to see me.

39:43.506 --> 39:46.300
Uh-uh. Nope.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.388
She says Mark is no longer
a viable vice president.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.390
He's not communicating her wishes.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.142
She wants to deal directly with me.

39:55.851 --> 39:58.646
She's in no position to demand anything.

40:03.818 --> 40:04.944
My God.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.196
You want to meet with her.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.407
She's still the president.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.784
Who had three abortions,

40:12.576 --> 40:14.453
lied to the American people about one.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.831
I told you, I'm not willing to use that.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.877
Then you'll use the other thing.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.089
What Mark told us.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.345
Seal. The case was pretty typical.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.847
Prep school drugs.

40:33.472 --> 40:36.976
Duncan Shepherd was rich enough
to get off, but the other boy,

40:37.351 --> 40:38.436
not so lucky.

40:39.353 --> 40:40.353
But...

40:40.563 --> 40:41.647
the transcript.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.901
- Hmm. Fascinating read.
- Painful, really.

40:49.780 --> 40:50.823
Ms. Shepherd's here.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.186
Oh, please send her in.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.079
- Annette.
- Claire.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.207
- Jane.
- Annette.

41:00.541 --> 41:03.711
I'm honored we've graduated
to a first name basis.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.588
Surnames can be a burden.

41:05.671 --> 41:06.839
That's funny.

41:07.339 --> 41:09.008
I've always loved mine.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.844
What about you, Claire? You gave yours up.

41:11.927 --> 41:12.970
Exactly.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.097
You feel more like an Underwood?

41:15.848 --> 41:18.601
Well, like you said.
Surnames can be a burden.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.895
I like your...

41:21.604 --> 41:22.813
lady quotes. What is woman?

41:24.607 --> 41:26.233
<i>De Beauvoir </i> question.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.278
That's right. From <i>The Second Sex?</i>
Remember that class, Annette?

41:30.029 --> 41:32.031
How strange it was, as a teenager,

41:32.114 --> 41:35.409
to be taught feminism by a man in French.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.036
I hated that book.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.996
Long-winded, for sure.

41:39.622 --> 41:40.998
But you gotta admit.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.125
She was right about everything.

41:51.884 --> 41:52.927
Work with me.

41:54.803 --> 41:57.139
Directly, without a middleman.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.557
What use is Mark,

41:58.891 --> 42:00.267
if he can't be effective?

42:00.351 --> 42:01.810
Mark can be very effective.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.230
Well, but both sides are unhappy.

42:04.897 --> 42:06.106
The Supreme Court.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.900
This is a choice

42:07.983 --> 42:10.319
that outlives any presidency.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.612
Exactly.

42:11.987 --> 42:15.282
But also part
of what defines a presidency.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.534
Of course.

42:17.117 --> 42:18.619
So I can't be...

42:21.038 --> 42:23.415
I will consider any informed opinion.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.919
But I... You understand.

42:28.170 --> 42:30.589
The decision has to be mine, Annie.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.135
No one calls me that anymore.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.222
Your son, how old is he now?

42:41.267 --> 42:43.227
Twenty-seven? No...

42:43.811 --> 42:46.772
Twenty-eight. I always seem
to make him a year younger.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.857
He always did look young for his age.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.986
Especially his juvenile mugshot.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.238
Such a baby face.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.575
So, you'll speak to Bill?

43:00.536 --> 43:01.662
I don't need to.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.666
You're the president.
You should do what you want.

43:07.084 --> 43:08.544
That's what I keep thinking.

43:09.795 --> 43:11.839
Do you remember how much fun
we used to have,

43:12.631 --> 43:14.550
before we understood the rules?

44:06.226 --> 44:08.270
Look, let's not let it all
break down here, okay?

44:08.354 --> 44:09.480
Correct me if I'm wrong,

44:09.563 --> 44:12.167
but you've neverÂ had a foothold like this
in the White House. So...

44:12.191 --> 44:14.568
You want to save her or fuck her?

44:14.652 --> 44:17.655
- Either way, do it on your time.
- Don't make it personal.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.908
Don't insult me.

44:24.578 --> 44:25.704
Shut her down.

44:26.622 --> 44:27.622
Show it to her.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.793
That's what Bill and I want.
And you'll do it.

44:31.126 --> 44:32.126
No.

44:34.046 --> 44:37.383
- I'm not asking.
- The fallout from that...

44:37.466 --> 44:38.384
Not my concern.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.260
It will be your concern.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.478
You're on your own now.

44:50.396 --> 44:52.940
- Oh, no, no, we're done.
- Don't.

44:54.692 --> 44:55.776
Annette.

45:00.906 --> 45:03.492
<i>The reign of the middle-aged white man
is over.</i>

45:04.076 --> 45:06.578
<i>The Bill Shepherds of the world
who won't let go,</i>

45:06.662 --> 45:07.871
<i>have to go.</i>

45:08.288 --> 45:11.542
The waitress who filmed it works
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.

45:11.959 --> 45:15.170
They were hoping to use the clip when
it came to Judge Abruzzo's confirmation.

45:16.922 --> 45:18.173
Okay, thank you.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.260
Have you heard from Tom Yates, Kelsey?

45:22.678 --> 45:24.096
No. Uh...

45:24.179 --> 45:25.764
You were friendly with him, right?

45:26.890 --> 45:29.476
I haven't heard from Tom in a long time.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.896
And your coworkers,
have they asked about him at all?

45:32.980 --> 45:34.314
Now and then.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.024
He used to roam around down there.

45:36.442 --> 45:37.609
Everyone liked him.

45:38.819 --> 45:41.881
Well, I had my national security team
look into it. And they tracked him down.

45:41.905 --> 45:45.826
It seems he's been using his credit card
in and around Prague, apparently.

45:46.326 --> 45:47.578
I'm glad to hear it.

45:48.996 --> 45:51.248
No, because I was worried.

45:51.331 --> 45:54.668
We used to talk a lot,
and then it just stopped.

45:55.919 --> 45:58.297
Did you ever read anything
he was working on...

45:58.380 --> 46:01.467
...besides the speeches he wrote for me?

46:01.550 --> 46:03.177
No, just the early stuff.

46:04.970 --> 46:05.970
Cathy.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.765
Oh, Stan.

46:09.641 --> 46:11.185
Oh, my God.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.288
That's all for now. When did it happen?

46:18.233 --> 46:19.985
I'm so, so sorry.

46:21.779 --> 46:25.407
No, the last conversation I had with her,
she was talking about her new job

46:26.658 --> 46:29.411
and what a great opportunity
it was going to be.

47:24.174 --> 47:25.384
Madam President.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.053
<i>Forgive me for calling so late.</i>

47:29.555 --> 47:31.265
<i>I've just been informed...</i>

47:32.224 --> 47:34.184
<i>that Catherine Durant is dead.</i>

47:36.520 --> 47:39.273
It's an embolism, they're saying.
Connected to her fall.

47:41.900 --> 47:45.737
I want to thank you, Doug,
so much for your help.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.620
It's a shame.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.665
It's a terrible shame.

47:58.333 --> 47:59.376
<i>Yes...</i>

48:00.878 --> 48:02.880
<i>a terrible, terrible shame.</i>

48:04.006 --> 48:05.632
She will be missed.

49:04.316 --> 49:05.316
Mark.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.486
Apologies for disturbing your run.

49:07.569 --> 49:08.403
What's happened?

49:08.487 --> 49:10.247
- Can we have a word in private?
- Of course.

49:10.572 --> 49:12.824
It's okay, Steve.
My detail cleared the area.

49:13.283 --> 49:14.886
- Clear.
- Okay, we're clear.

49:14.910 --> 49:16.030
Where are we going?

49:30.342 --> 49:31.677
You have 20 seconds.

49:32.636 --> 49:36.056
I can get rid of this,
or the cops will find him.

49:42.187 --> 49:44.064
You've run out of options,
Madam President.

49:47.609 --> 49:48.986
I understand.
