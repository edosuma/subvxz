00:37.035 --> 00:39.810

00:40.392 --> 00:43.846

Jay Jay 1 dash 1 dash 28

01:22.528 --> 01:23.910
Broadcast, what's your 20?

01:24.624 --> 01:28.412
Cabo Hotel...

01:32.004 --> 01:33.323

01:42.738 --> 01:43.654
30, over, 3

01:44.104 --> 01:46.557
Cabo Hotel...

04:12.590 --> 04:16.253
Good morning, you're listening
to Station K-I-L-L, 91.1

04:16.283 --> 04:20.149
Traffic report coming up but first:
commercial free music for the commute.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.816
<i>Sittin' at my Mom's,
starin' at the screen</i>

05:03.846 --> 05:05.927
<i>Wonderin' where you are,
where you been</i>

05:05.957 --> 05:07.775
<i>and when you're gonna meet me.</i>

05:08.224 --> 05:11.671
<i>Tryin' not to pay attention
when they're all sayin'</i>

05:11.701 --> 05:14.556
<i>that's it's all just a
stupid game that I'm playin'</i>

05:14.586 --> 05:14.991
Jane!

05:15.907 --> 05:17.304
Come on, you're going
to be late for school.

05:18.049 --> 05:19.400
Be down in a jiff, Dad.

05:19.430 --> 05:22.691
<i>it's just the way it's got to be</i>

05:22.721 --> 05:25.164
<i>if they won't have room to...</i>

05:26.592 --> 05:28.036
Scared the hell out of me.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.225
I told you to call me

05:30.427 --> 05:32.010
before you sneak in my room.
Sorry.

05:32.516 --> 05:34.984
You're just...
you're so sexy when you're scared

05:35.636 --> 05:36.444
Couldn't help myself.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.951
What time do you
have to be in Court?

05:52.184 --> 05:53.364
9 o'clock sharp.

05:54.304 --> 05:56.431
and this one's going to
drag on for a couple of days.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.502
I know,

05:57.812 --> 05:59.923
that's why I took a few days off

05:59.953 --> 06:01.290
and packed a bag and

06:01.885 --> 06:04.214
got us a room at Seasons Inn,

06:04.679 --> 06:05.331
your favorite.

06:05.921 --> 06:07.117
You serious?
You bet!

06:07.588 --> 06:09.839
I think that Jenny would be fine
for a few days on her own,

06:09.869 --> 06:13.130
plus it'll give us
time to catch up,

06:13.627 --> 06:14.341
if you know what I mean.

06:17.575 --> 06:19.267
That sounds great!
Hmm!

06:23.490 --> 06:25.259
Did you hear that?
Hear what?

06:31.861 --> 06:34.842
School starts in 20 minutes.
Let's ditch,

06:35.354 --> 06:37.409
drink a couple of beers, have fun...

06:37.642 --> 06:40.436
I haven't missed a day of school since
I had Mono, Freshman Year.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.196
Same here, I did it for a year too.

06:43.066 --> 06:45.550
No, I'd rather stay current,

06:47.375 --> 06:48.089
get good grades,

06:48.671 --> 06:50.161
try and get into a good school.

06:51.176 --> 06:54.436
You know, the boring things
you're supposed to do.

06:57.407 --> 06:58.136
Get in the closet!

06:59.239 --> 07:00.015
Second!

07:04.993 --> 07:07.384
There better not be
anybody in here with you.

07:08.315 --> 07:10.163
No, Dad, just talkin' to myself.

07:11.249 --> 07:12.429
You're sure there's no one in here?

07:13.956 --> 07:17.200
Cause, you know, the truth will
set you free and lies will kill you.

07:17.744 --> 07:18.737
So you've told me.

07:19.705 --> 07:23.074
Anyway, your mother and I
won't be home til tomorrow night.

07:23.462 --> 07:25.046
She's going into the city with me.

07:25.791 --> 07:28.337
You think you can handle that?
Yeah, I think I can handle that.

07:29.892 --> 07:33.571
It's good to see you happy again.
How you doin', kiddo?

07:35.496 --> 07:38.585
I'm ok, really.
Good.

07:38.615 --> 07:40.841
Cause you know me: I just
want to make sure you're happy.

07:41.477 --> 07:42.859
I'll do anything to ensure that.

07:43.061 --> 07:44.411
No need to remind me.

07:44.955 --> 07:47.097
Good.
Tell Mom I love her.

07:50.541 --> 07:51.115
Will do.

08:00.186 --> 08:01.086
What was that all about?

08:01.490 --> 08:02.887
Don't worry about it,
it's nothing.

08:03.213 --> 08:04.347
Sounded like something.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.740
You could tell me.
No, I can't.

08:12.626 --> 08:13.635
Is everything alright?

08:15.234 --> 08:17.004
Yeah, of course, it's fine.

08:19.536 --> 08:20.918
I just wonder how she's doing.

08:21.477 --> 08:24.209
Yeah, she seems happier now.

08:24.690 --> 08:27.314
I think everything that happened
is behind her

08:27.655 --> 08:29.456
or as much as it can be, anyway.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.432
Yeah?
I do.

08:32.751 --> 08:33.745
How about you?

08:36.275 --> 08:38.030
I don't want to talk about it

08:38.184 --> 08:40.234
and as far as I'm concerned, it's over.

08:45.444 --> 08:46.469
Why don't you trust me?

08:47.353 --> 08:48.688
I do. I just...

08:50.210 --> 08:51.359
I can't tell anyone.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.949
I'm your boyfriend.
You're supposed to tell me everything.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.119
Look, you remember my accident?

08:59.709 --> 09:00.904
Yeah, I remember
you telling me about it.

09:03.391 --> 09:04.260
It was a big deal.

09:07.101 --> 09:08.684
I wanted to tell the truth but...

09:18.189 --> 09:19.136
You have everything?

09:19.524 --> 09:20.517
I think so.

09:30.260 --> 09:31.580
You don't think she'll
throw a party, do you?

09:36.465 --> 09:37.412
You know what? I don't care,

09:37.442 --> 09:39.461
as long as she doesn't
get in trouble or wreck the house.

10:08.405 --> 10:09.787
Correct me if I'm wrong but

10:10.594 --> 10:12.410
your parents are leaving for a few days.

10:12.876 --> 10:13.435
Yeah?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.285
I'd say that's grounds to
throw a little party.

10:16.969 --> 10:18.226
You want me to throw a party?

10:21.817 --> 10:22.283
No!

10:26.723 --> 10:28.260
You owe it to yourself.
Have a little fun.

10:29.446 --> 10:31.619
Well, I guess.

10:33.373 --> 10:35.050
No! I need to go to school.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.217
Come on! What's one day
going to hurt?

10:41.751 --> 10:43.350
Why am I even considering this?

10:44.483 --> 10:46.206
I guess it is just one day.

10:50.035 --> 10:53.590
Just a few people.
Inner circle only.

10:54.661 --> 10:55.561
You're trouble!

11:34.090 --> 11:36.263
Are you ok?
I think so.

11:44.194 --> 11:45.296
Hold up, asshole!

12:13.510 --> 12:17.189
<i>Met an old man today,
standing on a street</i>

12:17.219 --> 12:21.350
<i>wearing a sign that read:
This is my last day in life</i>

12:21.380 --> 12:23.150
<i>so, I start to let go...</i>

13:39.321 --> 13:41.882
Did you text them?
Yes, I did.

13:43.077 --> 13:43.900
They'll be here soon.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.976
Max! Going somewhere?

14:05.395 --> 14:08.515
Oh, Mr. Gullman, I was just
heading to the bathroom.

14:08.545 --> 14:11.465
Those Sloppy Joes really do
a number on your stomach.

14:12.272 --> 14:13.949
Yeah, my dad has a spastic colon...

14:13.979 --> 14:16.733
Well, take care of business
and get back to class.

14:16.763 --> 14:20.427
If there's any one in this institution
that needs an education,

14:20.457 --> 14:22.383
trust me, it's you, Tidwell!

14:23.269 --> 14:27.166
Yeah! You're so inspiring,
Principal Galman.

14:27.725 --> 14:31.233
That's a nice shirt.
Did you get that at Costco?

14:31.559 --> 14:32.211
Go!

14:37.291 --> 14:41.172
I can't believe old Goody Two Shoes
is throwing a party!

14:41.498 --> 14:44.820
She's never any fun til
3 o'clock on Friday.

14:45.114 --> 14:48.374
Whatever! Anything to get
me out of History class.

14:48.715 --> 14:51.820
If I have to hear about that
Castro guy one more time,

14:51.850 --> 14:54.836
I'm...
Who the hell is Castro?

14:56.140 --> 14:58.096
I'm gonna forget
that you said that.

15:00.953 --> 15:01.977
What's up, asshole?

15:03.597 --> 15:04.528
Yo, let's get out of here.

15:06.779 --> 15:08.751
What? I didn't do anything.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.079
I know.
I just like to slap.

15:11.109 --> 15:13.894
Ok, well, let me know next time. I'll
give you something better to slap...

15:13.924 --> 15:15.229
like my penis.

15:15.601 --> 15:17.340
Will you two stop flirting!

15:17.573 --> 15:19.901
That's the disturbing part:
threy are flirting.

15:24.730 --> 15:26.748
You're having thoughts, aren't you?

15:27.059 --> 15:28.130
Not really.

15:29.853 --> 15:30.334
Yes.

15:31.842 --> 15:34.078
I can't make up my mind.
Look...

15:35.739 --> 15:37.229
you've been through
something traumatic.

15:38.533 --> 15:41.312
I can't believe that you've been
dealing with this for so long.

15:44.558 --> 15:46.886
It's been over a year. That's longer
than we've known each other.

15:49.370 --> 15:52.584
I don't know if I...
Could live with yourself?

15:55.307 --> 15:56.487
I didn't mean it like that.

16:00.197 --> 16:01.268
Hey, c'mon!

16:01.905 --> 16:04.705
What if I killed someone?
You don't remember?

16:59.412 --> 17:03.029
What kind of booze does
the great Detective Bilson drink?

17:04.194 --> 17:05.906
Pine, you don't...hey!

17:06.265 --> 17:09.525
You don't think a detective might
notice you drinking his booze.

17:09.990 --> 17:11.417
He measures it by the mililiter

17:12.257 --> 17:13.871
and he drinks...a lot.

17:15.090 --> 17:17.946
For a smart guy, you're
pretty dumb, Max.

17:17.977 --> 17:21.425
Aw, Trina, your hostility's endearing.

17:21.454 --> 17:22.887
You must really care!

17:22.917 --> 17:26.583
I'll have you know that
I care about you too.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.608
Shut up!

17:27.858 --> 17:29.737
Easy!
Got Appletini?

17:29.954 --> 17:30.668
Do we have that?

17:32.065 --> 17:33.416
Where the hell did you get this?

17:33.446 --> 17:35.543
It's been in the trunk of my car,
the past two weeks.

17:37.816 --> 17:40.828
Hey, don't even think about
using those martini glasses.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.349
It's cool!

17:45.873 --> 17:47.705
Drink this.
We'll replace it later.

17:48.163 --> 17:50.150
Your Dad rubs off on you nicely.

17:50.771 --> 17:51.966
Don't be an asshole.

17:52.594 --> 17:54.566
Sorry, Jenny.
Don't worry about it. Drink up!

17:54.892 --> 17:57.640
Lettin' loose, are we? I like it!
Why not?

17:58.685 --> 17:59.477
Life's too short.

18:14.781 --> 18:20.370
<i>There was a time I was out of my mind
...didn't see the signs?</i>

18:20.809 --> 18:26.630
<i>Time after time, my friends would try
to try to make, try to make me see</i>

18:42.775 --> 18:43.428
Hey, there!

18:49.362 --> 18:50.946
Are you a friend of the Bilsons?

18:55.187 --> 18:58.229
Dale and I are
colleagues from the force.

18:58.259 --> 19:00.015
Well, he and his wife left earlier.

19:00.247 --> 19:01.800
Looks like you've missed them.

19:02.722 --> 19:06.354
But since you're here, can I
talk you into a cup of coffee?

19:06.944 --> 19:10.608
I see. That's very neighborly of you.
Sure, come on in.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.954
One moment.
I need to get this.

19:36.741 --> 19:37.548
You know, erm...

19:38.977 --> 19:39.799
I really...

19:40.669 --> 19:42.920
I appreciate you humoring me.

19:44.103 --> 19:46.633
It's been lonely since
my husband died and

19:47.254 --> 19:51.492
Well, I mean, the neighborhood
has just changed so much!

19:52.802 --> 19:56.791
I can remember when all us
housewives would get together and

19:57.133 --> 19:58.934
and have coffee every morning.

19:59.405 --> 20:01.330
Now, the neighborhood is empty.

20:02.153 --> 20:05.646
Everybody's at work,
even the wives!

20:12.477 --> 20:15.317
Neighborhood's like a ghost town
from nine to five.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.065
You don't say!

20:22.465 --> 20:27.929
So, umm, do you need
anything washed, hmm?

20:29.052 --> 20:29.425
Maybe.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.942
Well, then, how about
that cup of coffee?

20:47.545 --> 20:49.548
What are you doing?
Please stop!

21:02.124 --> 21:02.869
No!

21:06.098 --> 21:08.426
Please don't hurt me!

21:09.455 --> 21:11.334
No! Please! No!

21:12.420 --> 21:15.711
Please stop! Oh, my God! Stop!

21:39.855 --> 21:43.271
Thanks for the coffee
but I'm a married man.

22:11.451 --> 22:12.491
Here you go, Lehman.

22:13.019 --> 22:15.906
Sift through this bullshit with
a teaspoon and then file it.

22:16.465 --> 22:16.947
Got it.

22:17.831 --> 22:19.337
And don't look so goddamned smug.

22:19.592 --> 22:20.958
You asked for this job.

22:21.284 --> 22:22.883
You're the one who put me in this position

22:22.913 --> 22:25.134
for asking the right questions about a case.

22:25.916 --> 22:29.067
I remember you stickin' your
fuckin' nose in an investigation

22:29.097 --> 22:30.294
where it didn't belong

22:30.324 --> 22:31.869
and then fuckin' up the truth

22:31.899 --> 22:34.454
with a bunch of goddamm
hypothetical scenarios

22:34.484 --> 22:36.974
that made no fucking sense.

22:39.653 --> 22:43.643
Like I said:
you asked for this job,

22:43.673 --> 22:45.676
now, answer the fuckin' phone.

22:50.608 --> 22:52.984
Fountain Hills Police Department,
what's your emergency?

22:54.381 --> 22:55.359
Oh, hey, Gina.

22:57.616 --> 22:59.634
No, Detective Bilson
didn't show up here either.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.192
Bilson didn't show up for court.

23:06.532 --> 23:08.504
I'll handle it.
I'm sure you will.

23:08.534 --> 23:10.211
Knock off that fuckin' attitude!

23:10.413 --> 23:12.074
Don't know what you're
talking about, Detective!

23:14.030 --> 23:15.459
Stuck on Dispatch?

23:17.183 --> 23:18.736
When they gonna
let you off this detail?

23:19.093 --> 23:20.801
When I admit that there
was nothing wrong with

23:20.831 --> 23:23.672
a couple of Senior Detectives
tampering with an investigation.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.650
Gotta love Popo politics.

23:27.699 --> 23:28.879
Am I still gonna see you tonight?

23:31.674 --> 23:35.271
My place, 7 o'clock.
Now, get away from me.

23:47.408 --> 23:50.047
<i>You got your boots
you got your sexy attitude</i>

23:50.077 --> 23:53.436
<i>and from the outside</i>

26:30.563 --> 26:31.805
Knew you kept it.

27:00.616 --> 27:01.966
I hada good time on Frioday.

27:04.922 --> 27:05.714
I know you did.

27:07.551 --> 27:11.277
It was very... unexpected

27:13.636 --> 27:16.710
but very nice!
I have no complaints.

27:16.740 --> 27:17.595
Me neither.

27:20.787 --> 27:23.411
After we finish that, you want
to go explore the upstairs?

27:25.693 --> 27:26.692
Bit forward!

27:27.143 --> 27:31.024
Well, I don't really know what else
to say. I'm not exactly that smooth.

27:37.437 --> 27:38.229
You're smooth enough.

28:00.023 --> 28:03.453
Spin the bottle!
Seriously?

28:04.090 --> 28:04.431
What?

28:04.959 --> 28:06.496
I think we're all
a little too old.

28:07.933 --> 28:10.743
Speak for yourself, I
could use a little action.

28:11.007 --> 28:15.617
If you absolutely don't want to
kiss somebody, just take a shot.

28:33.277 --> 28:35.093
Fuck you, Trina, alright?
I know how to kiss.

28:35.823 --> 28:37.065
Your mom tell you that?

28:37.832 --> 28:41.713
I know mine did.
Oh, that is so wrong!

28:42.852 --> 28:44.466
You're so incredibly right!

28:59.009 --> 29:03.125
He's tonguin', man. Oh, yeah!

29:03.155 --> 29:05.266
Hey! Come up for air, will ya?

29:19.016 --> 29:20.512
Don't look at me like that!
Come on.

29:26.829 --> 29:27.638
Here goes nothin'!

29:41.363 --> 29:44.049
Wow!
For the old girl.

29:45.653 --> 29:48.929
What are you doing, Cathy? Careful...

29:48.959 --> 29:49.338
Yeah?

29:51.077 --> 29:51.744
Oh,really.

29:57.288 --> 29:59.135
Why don't you come
drink it off me, Billy Boy?

29:59.958 --> 30:01.293
You don't have to ask me twice.

30:07.534 --> 30:08.201
Gross!

30:10.266 --> 30:12.051
Gross! Gross!

30:17.566 --> 30:20.267
Alright, move kids! You
had fun, out of the way.

30:36.817 --> 30:37.842
Damn, Bobby

30:38.835 --> 30:40.946
Shh, Hey.
Get down!

30:41.738 --> 30:44.129
I know we should have.
Seriously?

30:45.402 --> 30:46.395
I got my period.?

30:53.176 --> 30:53.641
Fuck it!

30:53.984 --> 30:54.885
I intend to.

31:23.207 --> 31:24.791
At least they're getting some!

31:57.500 --> 32:00.356
...what's wrong?
I thought someone kicked the bed.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.655
Trust me, that was just us.

32:17.826 --> 32:20.062
Shit!
Did you just come in me?

33:18.922 --> 33:19.791
This is...

33:21.545 --> 33:24.308
Get over here, Maxie, now!

33:25.448 --> 33:26.814
Slow it down, cowgirl

34:44.043 --> 34:47.366
God, you're so hot!
Ready for me?

34:47.552 --> 34:48.313
Yeah.

34:51.482 --> 34:56.077
There's something I like to do...
Oh, yeah? Whatever.

34:56.481 --> 34:57.490
I'm down.

35:07.132 --> 35:10.408
I pitch first.
Now, get on your knees!

35:20.092 --> 35:23.724
That goddamned kid smokin'
dope on my property again!

35:23.754 --> 35:25.292
Son of a Bitch!

35:31.552 --> 35:32.794
Fountain Hills Police Department...

35:34.859 --> 35:36.085
Do you have a license plate number?

35:41.174 --> 35:42.881
Thank you, sir. We'll send
someone out right away.

35:43.782 --> 35:44.325
Detective?

35:45.039 --> 35:47.865
I just got a call from some
old farmer lives out on Highway 8...

35:48.066 --> 35:50.457
says there's an abandoned car
parked out on his property...

35:50.671 --> 35:53.760
I'm fucking busy! Is this
going to take very long?

35:54.102 --> 35:55.887
The car is registered to Dale Bilson.

35:57.735 --> 36:00.203
Don't worry about it.
I'll look into it.

36:06.050 --> 36:07.820
I wonder what the hell
she's doin' to him up there?

36:09.186 --> 36:10.661
She's into some kinky stuff.

36:11.986 --> 36:14.268
God, I feel like
I'm running a brothel.

36:18.336 --> 36:20.975
Well, if you can't beat 'em,
you might as well join 'em.

36:32.406 --> 36:36.070
You guys ok in there?
I really don't know.

36:46.128 --> 36:47.199
Assholes!

36:50.622 --> 36:51.941
Your dad has a nice office.

37:06.464 --> 37:08.187
Why are all the
pictures turned around?

37:11.655 --> 37:12.819
What the fuck was that?

37:14.580 --> 37:15.248
Bill?

37:16.102 --> 37:18.306
If that's you, I'm walking in there.

37:21.650 --> 37:22.892
Oh, I'm such an ass!

37:29.190 --> 37:30.400
Desk it is!

37:34.297 --> 37:35.228
Was that weird?

37:37.407 --> 37:38.913
Don't worry, Maxie...

37:38.943 --> 37:42.980
I'm not going to tell anybody that
you like to take it like a little girl.

37:43.167 --> 37:44.766
That's not what I mean.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.545
I think I likes it but I
feel like I shouldn't have.

37:51.756 --> 37:53.029
I know, right?

37:56.791 --> 38:01.604
Take this in the shower?
Oh, I'll be in in a minute.

38:02.923 --> 38:03.451
Ok.

38:08.735 --> 38:09.402
It's alright.

39:29.941 --> 39:30.599
Trina!

40:55.631 --> 40:56.796
I'm satisfied.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.956
You're the best.
I know.

41:25.725 --> 41:28.085
Jeez! You scared the
heck out of me

41:28.271 --> 41:31.624
and now I gotta change.
Sorry, man!

41:31.784 --> 41:35.401
Yeah, just make sure the room looks exactly
ike it did when you went in there, ok?

41:35.431 --> 41:36.379
Cool.

41:54.515 --> 41:55.167
Mike?

42:01.035 --> 42:01.749
Mike!

42:06.848 --> 42:07.469
Mike?

42:09.890 --> 42:10.977
Yeah? In here.

42:11.815 --> 42:13.414
Use a cup!
Hey, Jenny!

42:14.232 --> 42:16.048
Hey, have you seen my cell phone?

42:16.731 --> 42:18.967
I thought I left it in the living
room but it's not there.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.830
Maybe one of the sexers took it.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.261
No dial tone.

42:30.776 --> 42:31.816
That's strange.

42:33.089 --> 42:33.958
Must be construction.

42:33.988 --> 42:36.959
You've reached Detective Dale Bilson
with Fountain Hills Police Department,

42:37.331 --> 42:40.250
please leave a message and your number
and I'll get back to you shortly.

42:46.740 --> 42:47.780
What the shit!

42:51.506 --> 42:53.198
Where'd you say
his car was parked again?

42:53.228 --> 42:54.456
Off Highway Eighth.

42:55.346 --> 42:57.861
I can help.
No.

42:58.513 --> 43:00.546
You can answer the fucking phone.

43:44.762 --> 43:46.082
What the fuck!

43:49.999 --> 43:52.856
Lehman, any word on Bilson?
No word.

43:54.889 --> 43:57.529
I'm going to run over to his
house and see if he's there.

43:58.157 --> 43:59.617
I want you to
get a hold of the hospital

43:59.647 --> 44:01.914
and see if either his wife
or he has been admitted.

44:02.836 --> 44:07.524
Is everything alright?
We'll see. Out.

44:10.868 --> 44:13.662
Oh, crap!
Just let it go.

44:14.144 --> 44:17.761
No shit! Don't answer it.
I have to.

44:27.935 --> 44:30.683
Hey, Mr. Mann!
I mean, Officer Mann.

44:32.981 --> 44:35.045
Home sick from school, huh?
Yeah!

44:36.318 --> 44:38.756
Flu bug!
Where's your Pop?

44:39.822 --> 44:41.654
He and Mom went to
the city for the night...

44:44.945 --> 44:47.119
When was the last time you
spoke with either of them?

44:47.460 --> 44:49.183
This morning, before they left.

44:51.517 --> 44:52.682
Is there something wrong?

44:57.090 --> 44:59.139
God, I really should
go back to sleep.

44:59.819 --> 45:00.719
I'll make you sick.

45:08.269 --> 45:11.840
Tell you what, Jenny,
I'm not a total fucking moron.

45:12.573 --> 45:14.870
Why don't you give up your
little game of ditch here

45:15.181 --> 45:17.230
and I'll just pretend like
I never saw you at home

45:17.260 --> 45:18.782
when you were supposed
to be in school.

45:22.343 --> 45:25.712
FYI: I may be comin' back.

45:27.544 --> 45:30.416
Yes, sir...
and thank you...

45:31.534 --> 45:32.077
Um...

45:32.803 --> 45:36.047
should I be worried, I mean
are Mom and Dad alright?

45:37.274 --> 45:39.602
No, nothin' to worry about

45:41.760 --> 45:43.126
but the party's over.

45:43.852 --> 45:44.318
Got it!

45:55.253 --> 45:56.480
Who was it?
My Dad's partner.

45:57.116 --> 45:58.700
Shit!
Yeah, party's over.

45:58.730 --> 46:00.671
Help me get everyone out of here.
Yeah, no worries.

46:00.701 --> 46:01.919
I'm really sorry.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.372
I shouldn't have talked you
into having a party.

46:04.605 --> 46:06.887
No, it was my choice. I
wanted to have fun. It's ok.

46:07.260 --> 46:09.231
We just have to go now, he may
be coming back later.

46:09.261 --> 46:10.209
I think he's looking for my Dad.

46:28.822 --> 46:29.645
This from me?

46:35.237 --> 46:36.355
Party's over!

46:37.892 --> 46:38.839
I'm comin' in!

46:55.750 --> 46:56.216
What?

46:57.691 --> 46:58.389
Bill?

46:58.995 --> 47:02.038
Cathy?
Are you guys alright?

47:12.935 --> 47:13.928
Oh, my God!

47:16.350 --> 47:19.346
Wake up! Sodom eye...

47:21.566 --> 47:22.420
Whoa!

47:26.895 --> 47:27.919
Let's get out of here!

47:29.316 --> 47:31.241
Somebody killed Trina.

47:37.283 --> 47:37.811
Back!

47:41.139 --> 47:42.396
Back, back!

47:43.529 --> 47:44.336
Back!

47:51.194 --> 47:52.312
Through the window, Jen!

48:25.227 --> 48:26.453
I know who he is.

48:38.819 --> 48:40.107
No! We have to get out of here, now.

48:40.843 --> 48:41.604
It's stuck!

49:07.154 --> 49:07.635
No!

49:41.954 --> 49:42.916
Goddammit!

50:13.565 --> 50:18.020
Shit! What the fuck!
What's goin' on, man?

50:18.649 --> 50:21.319
Holy shit, I thought
I was going to die.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.772
Oh, my God, Mike,
thank God you're here!

50:24.222 --> 50:26.489
We need to call the police right now.
That's what I'm doing right now.

50:27.032 --> 50:29.190
Yeah, we need help.
Somebody is trying to kill us.

50:29.437 --> 50:32.014
We're at 1012 Cherrywood Lane.

50:32.293 --> 50:33.178
Hurry, please!

50:33.970 --> 50:35.802
They're comin', right now.
Thank God!

50:36.205 --> 50:37.572
Should we hide?
Yeah.

50:40.005 --> 50:41.961
Shit! It's him.

50:46.965 --> 50:51.048
Well, it's him.
Calm down, you're freaking out, ok?

50:51.483 --> 50:52.368
Take a deep breath...

50:53.206 --> 50:54.914
Cops are coming.
We're gonna be fine, alright?

51:19.894 --> 51:22.021
Come on, come on, Jenny!
Open it, he's coming

51:25.234 --> 51:25.607
Come on!

51:36.965 --> 51:38.657
This is gonna hurt.
What do you mean?

51:44.402 --> 51:46.141
Guess who didn't call the cops.

51:46.979 --> 51:48.392
What now, Dad?

52:17.724 --> 52:20.549
What the fuck you doin'?
Lookin' for another demotion?

52:20.929 --> 52:21.566
I was just...

52:21.596 --> 52:24.453
You were just putting that shit away
is what you were doin'.

52:32.475 --> 52:34.974
What is it?
That car...

52:36.728 --> 52:39.988
It was parked across the street
from Dale Bilson's residence.

52:52.061 --> 52:52.589
Hey...

53:32.956 --> 53:34.803
Police, open the door!

53:42.463 --> 53:44.869
I said open this fuckin' door!

53:47.901 --> 53:48.569
Police!

54:04.323 --> 54:07.707
Where's Mrs. Donnatucci and
what the fuck are you doin' here?

54:07.737 --> 54:11.308
She went out of town.
She asked me to feed the fish.

54:11.609 --> 54:13.348
Get the fuck out of my way!

54:13.378 --> 54:16.298
Mrs. Donnatucci doesn't like
strangers in the house.

54:16.328 --> 54:19.278
Prove who you are, asshole!
Good!

54:20.851 --> 54:23.692
Then you'll understand why
I have to cut your head off.

54:23.722 --> 54:24.778
Go for it!

54:51.179 --> 54:52.669
You little cocksucker!

55:11.909 --> 55:14.020
Hang on, sweetie, hang on!

55:23.008 --> 55:23.706
Jenny!

55:32.103 --> 55:34.726
Detective?
Hold this, kid.

55:44.996 --> 55:45.819
I want to do it.

55:46.657 --> 55:50.057
I've never killed anyone before.

55:50.087 --> 55:52.712
Trust me, it feels good!

55:57.414 --> 56:00.224
Yeah, it does.

56:02.993 --> 56:04.188
Don't do it, kid.

56:18.750 --> 56:19.449
Tighter!

56:19.837 --> 56:20.535
Tighter!

56:22.460 --> 56:24.044
You're getting it first...

56:24.804 --> 56:26.015
You're gonna go first!

56:27.102 --> 56:29.120
Now choke me, you bastard!

56:46.687 --> 56:47.417
What's going on?

56:47.728 --> 56:49.016
Dale Bilson is missing

56:49.046 --> 56:51.624
and his car has been abandoned.
Mann's acting erratic.

56:51.872 --> 56:54.620
Something bad is happening
and it's happening right now.

56:55.552 --> 56:56.763
Can I at least help you out?

57:19.581 --> 57:20.636
This is Officer Lehman,

57:20.666 --> 57:22.934
of the Fountain Hills Police Department,
entering the premises!

57:56.329 --> 57:57.943
You starting to
put all of this together?

57:59.445 --> 58:02.473
Please, don't do this.

58:03.994 --> 58:05.764
Just let us go.

58:12.644 --> 58:14.150
You don't deserve your freedom.

58:17.379 --> 58:18.233
My wife...

58:19.863 --> 58:20.856
my little girl...

58:26.879 --> 58:27.593
What's that, Bill?

58:29.268 --> 58:33.087
You leave her alone, this is between you...
Dad?

58:33.336 --> 58:34.065
Is that fake?

58:37.905 --> 58:40.249
Dad, who are these people?

58:40.279 --> 58:42.345
Don't you worry...

58:44.689 --> 58:45.916
I have a little money.

58:46.661 --> 58:47.965
We could work somethin' out.

58:49.973 --> 58:52.255
She's so young to start doin' this!

58:53.885 --> 58:55.297
Don't do this to her.

58:56.617 --> 58:57.176
Dale...

58:59.914 --> 59:02.599
are you fucking insane?

59:04.788 --> 59:08.778
You let your daughter go free
when she killed my family.

59:09.129 --> 59:11.147
I'm sorry, Mr. Bilson...

59:12.808 --> 59:14.951
It looks like you've
created a monster.

59:17.341 --> 59:20.811
Then punish me and
let my daughter go!

59:22.099 --> 59:23.294
Let my daughter go.

59:33.341 --> 59:35.763
She has to pay.

59:45.148 --> 59:46.700
I'll turn myself in.

59:48.253 --> 59:49.231
I promise.

59:50.131 --> 59:52.615
Just please don't hurt us.

59:56.257 --> 59:58.073
Don't let him do this, Mike.

01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:05.888
You knew all along, what I did.

01:00:11.718 --> 01:00:15.848
You didn't think it was odd; we
first met after your accident?

01:00:16.857 --> 01:00:17.555
Let me tell you...

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.126
trying to date you

01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:23.399
was one of the hardest things.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.298
but you...
you took the bait.

01:00:29.328 --> 01:00:33.104
You took the bait and
it unfolded beautifully.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.094
I even got you to
admit to what you did.

01:00:43.231 --> 01:00:43.790
But Dad...

01:00:47.646 --> 01:00:49.136
I have to tell you...

01:00:50.409 --> 01:00:52.086
She didn't know
that she killed them.

01:00:52.334 --> 01:00:54.166
Her daddy covered up everything.

01:01:01.404 --> 01:01:02.258
I did it.

01:01:03.717 --> 01:01:04.524
I'm sorry.

01:01:09.906 --> 01:01:10.822
Oh, Jenny...

01:01:19.022 --> 01:01:19.814
You broke me.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:26.256
Do you resent him?

01:01:27.612 --> 01:01:28.171
Please!

01:01:29.196 --> 01:01:30.407
I didn't want to!

01:01:36.796 --> 01:01:42.525
Too late. Too late for you.
Too late for me.

01:01:48.463 --> 01:01:50.373
What did the others have to do with this?

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.318
Nothing. They wer
just caught in the storm.

01:01:57.048 --> 01:01:58.336
You're guilty too!

01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:02.528
You killed them.
We killed them.

01:02:06.926 --> 01:02:08.339
I'll take my punishment...

01:02:10.512 --> 01:02:11.444
just like you.

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:58.973
Climb higher, Daddy,
climb higher.

01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:04.872
No, no, the big red one!

01:03:10.297 --> 01:03:11.616
I love you, Daddy.

01:04:25.268 --> 01:04:28.963
Lehman, I traced the trail of bills and
cell phone to a house of Highway 8.

01:04:29.336 --> 01:04:30.562
I'm going out to check it out.

01:04:32.639 --> 01:04:34.952
Finch, don't move.
I'm on my way, over.

01:05:55.036 --> 01:05:56.495
I left you're... for you, honey.

01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:07.951
From a mother to a father...

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.164
you're doin' exactly
what I would have done

01:06:13.477 --> 01:06:14.626
but now you're here.

01:06:17.071 --> 01:06:18.236
What would your daughter think?

01:06:21.868 --> 01:06:22.986
What was her name?

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:33.423
Her name was Nadine.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:43.769
No, please, no...
No, please...

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:46.657
No, no, no!

01:06:47.797 --> 01:06:48.511
Shoot!

01:06:50.389 --> 01:06:51.259
Shoot!

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.528
Shoot!

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:04.941
No, nooooooo!

01:07:37.125 --> 01:07:38.367
Stop it.
Shoot!

01:07:44.998 --> 01:07:45.759
Fuck!

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:13.737
Oh, no...No, no!

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.200
What are you doing?
Call 911.

01:08:31.531 --> 01:08:33.859
What?
Call 911!

01:08:34.465 --> 01:08:38.734
Tell them what you did. The
truth will set you free, Jenny.

01:08:50.063 --> 01:08:52.096
911, what is your emergency?

01:08:54.755 --> 01:08:55.328
I...

01:08:56.850 --> 01:08:57.796
hit someone.

01:08:58.232 --> 01:09:00.095
Has there been a physical altercation?

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.470
Are you hurt?
No.

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:03.796
I mean...

01:09:05.877 --> 01:09:07.475
I hurt those people.

01:09:08.392 --> 01:09:09.448
What is your location?

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:11.636
I don't know.

01:09:12.571 --> 01:09:15.210
Can you give me anything,
a landmark, street name?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.109
I hit someone with my car.

01:09:23.148 --> 01:09:24.965
I killed a family.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.830
I killed a mother and her daughter

01:09:29.488 --> 01:09:30.606
in a hit-and-run

01:09:32.716 --> 01:09:34.673
I was drunk driving

01:09:35.573 --> 01:09:36.086
and I

01:09:36.993 --> 01:09:38.064
I hit them

01:09:41.921 --> 01:09:44.203
My father, Detective Dale Bilson,

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:46.269
covered it up.

01:09:47.697 --> 01:09:49.870
Ma'am, we don't
have time for crank calls.

01:09:55.923 --> 01:09:57.863
They hung up on me.
No shit!

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:02.645
Of course, 911 would hang up
on you. Ain't that a cherry!

01:10:02.675 --> 01:10:04.554
I want them to believe me

01:10:06.913 --> 01:10:08.357
So much for doin' the right thing.

01:10:09.447 --> 01:10:12.024
Now, you're gonna
grow up without a mother

01:10:12.257 --> 01:10:13.437
Don't you fucking move!

01:10:25.562 --> 01:10:26.089
Drop it!

01:10:28.232 --> 01:10:30.483
Now! Drop your weapon!

01:10:34.753 --> 01:10:35.606
I can't.

01:10:36.615 --> 01:10:38.463
Drop the gun and
take the punishment.

01:10:42.921 --> 01:10:44.132
Drop your weapon!

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.152
No.

01:10:58.678 --> 01:11:00.572
It's over, it's over.

01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:05.322
Jenny Bilson?

01:11:07.573 --> 01:11:08.504
I heard your confession.

01:11:14.301 --> 01:11:15.745
You're doing the right thing.

01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:18.073
You have the right to remain silent...
