00:02.134 --> 00:03.828
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:06.596
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.772 --> 00:08.637
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:08.807 --> 00:10.775
Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:10.943 --> 00:14.106
- Our love for Katherine wasn't real.
- I'm gonna bring her back.

00:14.279 --> 00:15.405
- I'm Anna.
- I'm Jeremy.

00:15.581 --> 00:17.947
My great-grandfather
showed me a journal.

00:18.117 --> 00:20.108
He had written creepy stuff
about vampires.

00:20.285 --> 00:22.480
Your turn. Any sad relationship stories?

00:22.654 --> 00:27.318
I fell in love, married young, wife died.

00:27.493 --> 00:29.256
I've never been in your room before.

00:30.396 --> 00:31.420
Elena?

00:32.564 --> 00:34.896
Who am I to you?
You are not Katherine.

00:35.067 --> 00:37.900
- Why do I look like her?
- You were adopted.

00:50.949 --> 00:52.712
How you doing in there?

00:53.719 --> 00:56.051
Stefan, who was that man in the road?

00:57.222 --> 01:00.316
I don't know.
Do you remember anything else about him?

01:00.492 --> 01:05.987
I wish. I never really saw his face.
He was wearing a hoodie.

01:06.165 --> 01:11.068
All I can remember is that there was
these black boots coming towards me.

01:11.837 --> 01:16.069
I brought some vervain
for, um, you and Jenna.

01:16.241 --> 01:21.144
And, um, I made this bracelet for Jeremy.
A few extra ones for friends.

01:21.313 --> 01:26.012
You can put it in jewelry,
or you can even put it in food or drink...

01:26.185 --> 01:31.487
...but as long as it's in you or on you,
a vampire cannot control you.

01:32.191 --> 01:34.216
Wow, so much to remember.

01:34.393 --> 01:36.657
I know,
but there's another vampire in town.

01:36.829 --> 01:41.698
So until we find out who it is
and what he wants, we have to be careful.

01:52.878 --> 01:56.507
Hey. It's gonna be $22.

01:56.682 --> 01:58.240
Elena, I need the money.

01:59.051 --> 02:01.110
Uh, here, come in.
Just put it on the table.

02:08.727 --> 02:09.785
Hey.

02:09.961 --> 02:11.020
Um...

02:12.097 --> 02:14.122
Keep the change.

02:15.134 --> 02:17.762
Thanks. And you have yourself
a good night.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.452
- What are you looking for, Damon?
- Not your concern.

02:41.627 --> 02:45.119
No, but putting Elena in harm's way,
that is my concern.

02:45.297 --> 02:48.755
- Heh, heh. What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Atlanta.

02:48.934 --> 02:51.801
Oh, yeah. Elena and I had a blast.

02:53.739 --> 02:58.108
I get it. You're bitter because one of us
gets to be with the person that we love...

02:58.277 --> 03:02.145
...and poor Katherine is just out of reach.
Unless there's another way...

03:02.314 --> 03:05.442
...for you to get into that tomb.
That what Bree said?

03:05.617 --> 03:09.576
- You're pathetic when you're fishing.
- You're transparent when deflecting.

03:10.289 --> 03:11.415
Don't you have school?

03:21.366 --> 03:23.800
- Surprised? It's a good essay.
- Heh.

03:23.969 --> 03:27.871
Your thoughts are clear, and your argument
is well laid out. It's just, uh...

03:28.073 --> 03:30.974
You don't actually think
there are vampires in Mystic Falls?

03:31.143 --> 03:34.579
No, I mean, I think statistically
there's been more animal attacks...

03:34.746 --> 03:37.476
...mysterious deaths, uh,
people gone missing...

03:37.649 --> 03:41.312
...and more than any other place
in the whole commonwealth of Virginia.

03:41.486 --> 03:45.149
It's conjecture but creative,
which is why you got the A.

03:45.324 --> 03:49.158
I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up
in the whole conspiracy theory of it all.

03:49.328 --> 03:51.319
Hey, I won't.

03:51.997 --> 03:56.559
Oh, uh, Jeremy, the source that you cited
for the 1860s info...

03:56.735 --> 04:00.102
...uh, "Johnathan Gilbert"?
- Oh, my ancestor's journal?

04:00.872 --> 04:03.397
- I'd really like to see that sometime.
- Really?

04:03.609 --> 04:07.875
A first-person account of the Civil War,
that's like, uh, porn for a history teacher.

04:09.147 --> 04:12.810
If you think my essay is creative,
wait till you get a load of this thing.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.617
Thank you.

04:25.631 --> 04:30.762
It's so pretty. Thank you.
God, it'll go with, like, everything.

04:30.936 --> 04:34.201
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion. Just a little friend gift.

04:34.373 --> 04:37.240
A lesbian-friend necklace,
because we're freaky like that?

04:37.409 --> 04:41.436
- Your friendship is important to me.
- Why are you being so mushy?

04:41.647 --> 04:44.013
Because you've been avoiding me.

04:44.182 --> 04:48.084
And I wanted you to know that whatever
is going on with you and Matt, it's okay.

04:50.088 --> 04:52.716
I was gonna talk to you about that.

04:52.891 --> 04:56.224
I was, but there's just not much to say.

04:56.395 --> 04:59.762
We've hung out a couple times.
That's it. But...

05:01.600 --> 05:04.592
I just feel like we've peaked as friends.

05:06.605 --> 05:09.301
This is weird.
I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

05:09.474 --> 05:12.568
- It's weird. It's weird, right?
- It's a little weird but...

05:12.744 --> 05:16.441
If it's what you and Matt want,
then it's not about me.

05:16.682 --> 05:17.910
But it's all about you.

05:19.318 --> 05:21.377
Matt's not over you and we all know it.

05:22.187 --> 05:23.449
I'm with Stefan now.

05:23.622 --> 05:26.750
Matt understands that.
He knows he has to move on.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.792
Matt Donovan. What do you know?

05:34.966 --> 05:37.901
- Ben McKittrick. What's up, man?
- Rough season, bud.

05:38.070 --> 05:42.234
Yeah, it's kind of hard to recover
when you have to forfeit half your games.

05:42.407 --> 05:43.897
You gonna be working here?

05:44.076 --> 05:48.103
Yep. Following in your footsteps,
minus the state championship.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.511
- Well, can't all be football gods.
- Yeah.

05:51.717 --> 05:53.981
So, what's the plan? Cook line?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.114
Busboy.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.454
I can't believe you're adopted.
I never saw that coming.

06:03.628 --> 06:04.754
And it gets weirder.

06:04.930 --> 06:08.661
My birth certificate lists Miranda
and Grayson Gilbert as my birth parents.

06:08.834 --> 06:11.166
- None of it makes sense.
- Which is why you should ask Jenna.

06:12.537 --> 06:15.938
First of all, the Elena I know would
always want the real truth, good or bad.

06:16.108 --> 06:17.439
And second of all?

06:17.609 --> 06:20.874
You just found out
your boyfriend is a vampire.

06:21.046 --> 06:24.743
So unless your birthparents are aliens,
how bad could it be?

06:26.518 --> 06:28.782
Uh, okay, look, I have to go to the store.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.616
My outfit for the dance
is severely lacking accessories.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.280
Okay, I'll pay the bill.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.688
Okay, bye.
Bye.

06:38.864 --> 06:40.263
What do you want from me?

06:41.166 --> 06:43.760
- I think we need a fresh start.
- You tried to kill me.

06:43.935 --> 06:46.369
But I didn't.
And if I wanted to, I would have.

06:46.538 --> 06:48.165
Does that not count for anything?

06:48.340 --> 06:52.640
You know I can start fires with my mind.
Fires kill vampires, right?

06:52.811 --> 06:55.905
Just stay the hell away from me.

06:56.581 --> 06:58.378
Everything okay over here?

06:58.550 --> 07:00.518
Yeah, we're fine.

07:00.852 --> 07:02.649
I wasn't talking to you.

07:14.466 --> 07:15.490
Thank you.

07:16.601 --> 07:19.536
- Anytime, Bonnie.
- Wait, you remember me?

07:19.704 --> 07:23.401
Heh. I didn't graduate that long ago.
You're making me feel old.

07:23.575 --> 07:25.509
No, I'm sorry. I didn't...

07:25.677 --> 07:29.340
I didn't mean that.
I just... I didn't know you knew me.

07:29.514 --> 07:32.608
I always know a pretty face.

07:44.696 --> 07:46.687
- Hello?
Hello, Elena.

07:46.865 --> 07:48.856
Hey, who is this?

07:49.100 --> 07:51.432
You hit me with your car.

07:51.903 --> 07:53.427
Is that a new one?

07:56.408 --> 07:59.900
You got away from me.
You won't next time.

08:10.889 --> 08:12.618
Why me?
What does he want with me?

08:12.791 --> 08:15.624
And if he's trying to kill me,
then why call first?

08:15.794 --> 08:18.695
It's because we're predators, Elena.
We hunt. We stalk.

08:18.864 --> 08:21.662
It's often as exciting as the kill.

08:23.568 --> 08:25.866
I want you to take this.

08:26.571 --> 08:28.971
This is Jeremy's pocket watch.
How did you get it?

08:29.140 --> 08:32.803
I took it from Damon who took it from
Logan who must have taken it from you.

08:32.977 --> 08:36.708
- What happened to it?
- Well, it's not just a watch.

08:36.881 --> 08:42.047
It's a sort of compass,
but it points to vampires.

08:50.795 --> 08:52.387
Why did my father have it?

08:52.564 --> 08:55.931
The Gilberts were one of the founding
families, and back in 1864...

08:56.101 --> 08:59.400
...they were among those
who sought to eradicate the vampires.

08:59.571 --> 09:01.903
The compass was used to find us.

09:03.608 --> 09:05.075
Did you know them?

09:07.178 --> 09:08.839
Yes.

09:10.215 --> 09:14.242
I want you to keep this. That way,
you'll know if you're ever in danger.

09:24.095 --> 09:26.188
I've never seen you such a mess.

09:26.364 --> 09:27.956
Heh. Don't talk smack.

09:29.034 --> 09:32.026
I mean, I just thought that
you told everyone else what to do.

09:32.203 --> 09:34.103
Well, I do that too.

09:34.272 --> 09:38.936
But if you want something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

09:43.281 --> 09:45.749
You know,
I just like that we're hanging out.

09:46.418 --> 09:50.081
- Who knew, you and me?
- Well, who knew you could be fun?

09:51.056 --> 09:53.616
So, what are you wearing
to this dumb dance anyway?

09:53.792 --> 09:58.058
- Should we color coordinate?
- Um, I'm not going.

09:58.229 --> 10:00.595
- Why not?
- I gotta work.

10:00.765 --> 10:04.064
- I'm bussing tables at the Grill.
- Since when are you a busboy?

10:06.004 --> 10:10.100
It's a job. You know,
some of us have to work, Caroline.

10:10.742 --> 10:13.006
With my mom in and out,
things are tight, so...

10:13.178 --> 10:17.444
Well, I didn't mean it like that. I just
meant that I didn't know you had a job.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.174
Well, I do.

10:20.385 --> 10:21.784
I gotta go.

10:28.426 --> 10:30.451
Hey, how'd it go?

10:30.962 --> 10:32.930
- What?
- The paper.

10:33.098 --> 10:35.794
Oh, uh, got an A.
Thanks for the articles. They really helped.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.435
Cool. So, what'd he say
about the vampires?

10:38.603 --> 10:40.764
- Did he believe it?
- I don't even believe it.

10:40.939 --> 10:44.102
It's just a paper, Anna.
Anyways, I, uh, gotta get going.

10:45.777 --> 10:49.543
Hey, do you wanna
do something later? Maybe?

10:49.714 --> 10:53.013
Oh, sorry, I'm stuck on punch duty
at the school dance.

10:53.184 --> 10:58.281
- Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?
- Well, I'm failing English, so I copped a plea.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.520
So maybe, you know,
tomorrow or something.

11:04.796 --> 11:06.320
I'm being pushy again, aren't I?

11:09.334 --> 11:13.134
Well, thanks for the help.
I'll see you around.

11:21.246 --> 11:25.376
Spoke to the insurance company.
Car is totaled.

11:26.084 --> 11:29.315
- You can keep using mine for now.
- So you're coming to the dance?

11:31.089 --> 11:33.182
Alaric asked me to help chaperone.

11:39.731 --> 11:41.323
Why didn't you tell me, Jenna?

11:43.968 --> 11:47.665
Your mom was gonna do it eventually.
I never thought I'd have to.

11:48.273 --> 11:52.607
If my mom were here right now
and I asked, she'd tell me the truth.

11:57.215 --> 12:02.778
Your dad was about to leave the office
one night when this girl showed up.

12:02.987 --> 12:07.356
She was 16, a runaway,
and about to give birth.

12:09.094 --> 12:12.621
He delivered her baby
and he gave her a place to stay...

12:12.797 --> 12:14.765
...but a few days later,
she disappeared.

12:16.701 --> 12:18.498
And there you were.

12:19.370 --> 12:23.101
Your parents were trying so hard
to have a baby. It just wasn't happening.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.811
All Miranda ever wanted
was to be a mom.

12:28.379 --> 12:31.542
But why were my parents' names
on the birth certificate?

12:31.716 --> 12:34.651
Your dad was a doctor, Elena.
He took care of it.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.279
They didn't wanna lose you, so they kept
it quiet, told as few people as possible.

12:39.457 --> 12:42.654
But if anyone ever wanted proof,
they had documentation.

12:44.129 --> 12:47.724
What else do you know about her?
The girl.

12:48.666 --> 12:51.635
Just her name. Isobel.

13:04.549 --> 13:06.073
You got the hair right.

13:08.820 --> 13:12.813
- Why are you bringing me Dad's journal?
- Because you were looking for it.

13:12.991 --> 13:16.324
- And why would I want it?
- Gee, I don't know, Damon.

13:16.494 --> 13:20.089
Maybe you wanna do a little bit
of posthumous bonding.

13:20.431 --> 13:23.332
Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it. I have.

13:23.501 --> 13:27.870
Nowhere in it does it say anything about
Katherine or the tomb or how to open it.

13:28.072 --> 13:30.870
I'm not surprised.
The man could barely spell his own name.

13:31.075 --> 13:34.636
I'm really sorry
that it won't be of any help...

13:34.813 --> 13:37.577
...with your diabolical plan, the sequel.

13:40.285 --> 13:44.449
- You know, I could help you.
- You help me?

13:44.622 --> 13:47.614
I don't know.
It seems a little unnatural.

13:48.626 --> 13:51.720
I'll do anything
to get you out of this town.

13:51.896 --> 13:54.729
- Even release Katherine.
- What about the other 26 vampires?

13:54.899 --> 13:57.993
No, no, they can't come.
They have to stay put, but Katherine...

13:58.169 --> 13:59.466
...I would consider that.

14:01.139 --> 14:03.300
What are you doing? Hmm?

14:03.474 --> 14:04.532
What's your angle?

14:05.910 --> 14:07.002
Think about it.

14:11.149 --> 14:14.016
- Why would I trust you?
- See that's your problem, Damon.

14:14.185 --> 14:16.676
You apply all of your shortcomings
to everybody else.

14:17.055 --> 14:21.890
If history is any indication,
there's only one liar among us.

15:08.907 --> 15:09.931
Hey, Jenna?

15:11.776 --> 15:15.177
Jenna? Jeremy?

15:41.205 --> 15:44.072
- Stefan's phone. How may I help you?
- Where is he?

15:44.242 --> 15:46.676
He's on his way to you.
Forgot his phone.

15:48.046 --> 15:52.745
Thank God. This compass was spinning.
Stefan must be here. Thank you.

15:52.917 --> 15:55.112
You're welcome.

15:57.889 --> 15:59.379
Elena!
Aah!

16:07.999 --> 16:10.627
You okay? You're okay.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.171
Well, how'd he get in?

16:21.479 --> 16:22.844
He was invited in.

16:23.281 --> 16:25.715
He posed as a pizza delivery guy
last night.

16:25.883 --> 16:27.851
Well, he gets points for that.

16:28.019 --> 16:31.216
- Did he say what he wanted?
- No, he was too busy trying to kill me.

16:31.389 --> 16:34.950
- And you have no idea who this is?
- No.

16:36.327 --> 16:39.455
Don't look at me like that.
I told you we had company.

16:39.630 --> 16:42.121
- You think there's more than one?
- We don't know.

16:43.835 --> 16:47.794
Damon, he was invited in.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.373
Then we go get him tonight.

16:53.978 --> 16:56.674
- You up for it?
- What do I have to do?

16:56.848 --> 17:00.181
Let your boyfriend take you to the dance.
We'll see who shows up.

17:00.351 --> 17:01.750
That's a bad idea.

17:01.919 --> 17:06.185
Till we get him, this house isn't safe.
For anyone who lives in it.

17:08.393 --> 17:09.758
It's worth a shot.

17:11.429 --> 17:12.487
I'll do it.

17:19.537 --> 17:22.131
I'll be with the two of you. I'll be safe.

17:54.705 --> 17:56.263
Alaric.

17:57.275 --> 17:59.903
Hey, look at you.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.603
I figured I'd stand out less
if I dressed up.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.042
Ha, ha. Liar.

18:04.215 --> 18:06.740
Okay, I'm a sucker
for the decade dance.

18:06.918 --> 18:10.786
I went to school here, you know.
They do the '60s and '70s too, FYI.

18:10.955 --> 18:12.217
Aw, can't wait.

18:13.591 --> 18:17.425
Can I get you a drink?
I hear the punch is real boss.

18:17.995 --> 18:19.724
- Ha, ha.
Yeah.

18:24.502 --> 18:25.560
Having fun?

18:25.736 --> 18:31.436
Mm, no, but this took about two hours,
so I'm at least staying half of that.

18:32.810 --> 18:33.834
What's Damon doing here?

18:37.849 --> 18:41.341
He wanted to come.
I promise, he'll behave.

18:41.519 --> 18:44.454
What is this, a threesome?
You and the Salvatore brothers?

18:44.622 --> 18:48.251
No, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan
then I have to learn to tolerate Damon.

18:48.426 --> 18:49.916
It's not like I can kill him.

18:50.094 --> 18:52.528
- There's a thought.
- Mm, I'll help.

18:54.632 --> 18:58.500
I'm really starting to see a change
in Jeremy. Finally.

18:58.669 --> 19:03.504
Losing someone you love so suddenly,
the trauma and the grief there...

19:03.674 --> 19:06.234
...is some of the tougher things
he'll face in life.

19:07.545 --> 19:10.013
From someone who knows.

19:10.515 --> 19:12.779
You have no idea what happened?

19:12.950 --> 19:15.043
That's the hard part, not knowing.

19:15.653 --> 19:17.382
Is it okay to talk about your wife?

19:17.555 --> 19:19.887
Heh. Well,
there's not much to talk about.

19:20.825 --> 19:24.556
That must be impossible to deal with,
not having any answers.

19:24.762 --> 19:27.663
I'd be lying if I told you
it didn't keep me up at night.

19:27.832 --> 19:31.165
Wondering why and by who.

19:32.837 --> 19:33.963
Maybe one day.

19:35.206 --> 19:36.332
Hope so.

19:39.443 --> 19:40.876
I hope so.

19:50.821 --> 19:51.845
Hi, Bonnie.

19:53.157 --> 19:54.317
Wanna dance?

19:55.092 --> 19:56.354
I'm out of here.

19:56.928 --> 19:58.395
Please give me another chance.

20:01.365 --> 20:02.389
Back off, Damon.

20:05.937 --> 20:07.234
Where did they go?

20:08.339 --> 20:10.705
- I don't know.
- What'd you say to them?

20:10.875 --> 20:12.604
I was perfectly polite.

20:13.611 --> 20:15.374
Elena...

20:15.546 --> 20:17.207
...would you like to dance?

20:17.515 --> 20:18.812
I would love to.

20:18.983 --> 20:20.075
Humph.

20:20.251 --> 20:21.548
May I have this dance?

20:59.423 --> 21:02.620
Shouldn't you guys be able
to sense each other or something?

21:02.793 --> 21:05.694
No, it doesn't work that way.
You see him anywhere?

21:06.297 --> 21:07.924
Not unless he has a pompadour.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.564
Well, it was not
one of the better fashion trends.

21:11.736 --> 21:14.068
Oh, come on,
I'm sure you looked great back then.

21:14.238 --> 21:17.605
- Are there pictures?
- No. Burned. Buried.

21:17.775 --> 21:20.573
Seriously, what was it like? The '50s.

21:20.745 --> 21:23.771
Because in my mind I have this picture
of somewhere between...

21:23.948 --> 21:27.782
...American Bandstand, Grease.
It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.

21:27.952 --> 21:33.891
Well, that and, you know, McCarthyism
and segregation, the nuclear arms race...

21:34.058 --> 21:38.051
- Okay, but there were poodle skirts.
- There were poodle skirts.

21:40.431 --> 21:42.558
You are teaching me
how to do the Hand Jive.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.963
- No, that's not gonna happen.
- Aw...

21:59.684 --> 22:02.482
You neglected to mention
this was a theme party.

22:02.653 --> 22:04.086
- What are you doing here?
- Mm.

22:04.255 --> 22:08.089
Seeing as you also neglected to invite me,
I took matters into my own hands.

22:08.259 --> 22:11.490
- You're doing that thing again.
- What thing would that be?

22:11.662 --> 22:14.187
The thing where you pretend
we're dating even though we're not.

22:14.365 --> 22:16.993
Oh. You mean stalking? Yeah.

22:17.168 --> 22:19.295
Ha, ha. Get over yourself.

22:19.470 --> 22:22.268
Come on, I've never been
to a school dance before.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.964
Humor me.

22:30.948 --> 22:32.939
Let's sit up there.

22:33.117 --> 22:35.278
Be a little more obvious, Bonnie.

22:35.453 --> 22:39.446
- Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.
- What? It's just a drizzle.

22:39.623 --> 22:41.887
I mean, Ben McKittrick, really?

22:43.327 --> 22:45.693
- He's hot.
- He's a washed-up jock...

22:45.863 --> 22:49.799
...who pours drinks for a living.
You could do way better.

22:50.468 --> 22:52.959
- Hey.
- What's up?

23:11.922 --> 23:15.153
Hey, I don't recognize you.
How'd you get roped into chaperoning?

23:17.228 --> 23:19.696
Alaric Saltzman.
I'm the new history teacher.

23:20.831 --> 23:26.064
- Oh, the cursed faculty position.
- So I've been told.

23:26.237 --> 23:28.501
Damon Salvatore.

23:28.672 --> 23:32.267
- Salvatore? As in, uh, Stefan?
- He's my little brother.

23:32.443 --> 23:35.674
I'm his legal guardian.
Hence, the chaperoning.

23:35.846 --> 23:39.680
I hear he's very bright, not that
I've had a chance to see for myself.

23:39.850 --> 23:44.253
Well, his attendance record's a little spotty.
Family drama.

23:45.089 --> 23:46.147
No parents?

23:47.091 --> 23:48.718
It's just the two of us now.

23:50.394 --> 23:52.453
You, uh, live here your whole life?

23:52.663 --> 23:55.530
On and off. Travel a bit.

23:55.699 --> 23:59.897
Really? Where? Around the States?

24:02.406 --> 24:05.807
I'm sorry. I'm nosy. I don't mean to pry.

24:07.044 --> 24:09.604
- Look, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.247
Enjoy the rest of the dance.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.723
Tonight was so much better on paper.

24:24.295 --> 24:28.561
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
Go and talk to him. Be bold and fearless.

24:28.732 --> 24:32.828
Yeah, this coming from the girl
who's been eye-stalking the bartender.

24:33.003 --> 24:34.561
You're right.

24:43.647 --> 24:44.944
Hi.

24:45.115 --> 24:48.516
- Twice in one day. Lucky me.
- I'm proving something to my friend.

24:48.719 --> 24:50.243
Oh, yeah? What's that?

24:50.421 --> 24:53.948
That you don't have to sit around
and wait for a guy to come up to you.

24:54.124 --> 24:56.649
Does that mean that
you're asking me out on a date?

24:56.827 --> 24:59.762
- Does that mean you want me to?
- What did you have in mind?

25:02.967 --> 25:05.492
- Do you like karaoke?
- No.

25:06.837 --> 25:11.297
But I would really like
to go on a date with you.

25:20.451 --> 25:22.942
- Seriously?
- Is that for me?

25:23.787 --> 25:25.618
Do you see anyone else
in the vicinity?

25:25.789 --> 25:27.381
Do you need something?

25:27.558 --> 25:30.288
- Are you mad at me or something?
- No, Care, I'm not mad...

25:30.461 --> 25:33.021
- Why are you being so weird?
- I'm not. I'm working.

25:33.197 --> 25:36.166
- You're avoiding.
- No, I have a table to clean.

25:36.834 --> 25:40.497
You know, that's the kind of thing that
washed-up jocks do to make a living.

25:49.079 --> 25:51.172
You don't go here.
You don't have to help.

25:51.348 --> 25:53.646
Oh, I don't mind. It's fun.

25:53.817 --> 25:56.911
Oh, um, yeah, before I forget,
can I borrow your ancestor's journal?

25:57.388 --> 25:59.185
- Why?
- You said I could read it.

25:59.657 --> 26:01.887
Uh, I don't have it.

26:02.693 --> 26:06.561
Oh, well, obviously you didn't bring it here,
but I can walk you home.

26:06.730 --> 26:09.426
No, I mean,
I gave it to my history teacher.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.728
- Wait, why did you give it to him?
- Because he wanted to read it.

26:12.903 --> 26:15.201
You shouldn't be giving that
to just anybody.

26:15.372 --> 26:19.001
- But I should give it to you?
- Loan. Loan it to me.

26:19.176 --> 26:20.939
Well, I loaned it to Mr. Saltzman.

26:21.545 --> 26:24.013
Maybe it's in his classroom.
We can get it back.

26:24.181 --> 26:27.116
What's the big deal
with the stupid journal?

26:28.686 --> 26:30.449
Your eye.

26:31.989 --> 26:34.856
Uh, there's something in it.
Forget it. I gotta go.

26:44.969 --> 26:47.904
Maybe he's not gonna show.

26:48.205 --> 26:50.765
You mean we did all this dancing
for nothing?

26:50.941 --> 26:53.466
Oh, the horror. Hee-hee.

26:53.644 --> 26:57.637
- I'm really sorry for all this.
- It's my choice. I decided to be here.

26:57.848 --> 27:02.080
I officially signed up for it, so I don't
wanna hear you apologizing anymore.

27:06.757 --> 27:08.384
Show me how it was done in the '50s.

27:08.559 --> 27:11.722
- Uh... No.
- Come on. One move?

27:26.644 --> 27:29.613
Now, you remember that
because it's never gonna happen again.

27:47.831 --> 27:50.322
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get the journal.

27:50.501 --> 27:53.299
As in, sticking to the plan,
something you're not doing.

27:53.470 --> 27:57.463
- Leave the girl alone.
- I like her. She looks like Katherine.

27:57.641 --> 28:00.132
She's not Katherine, okay?
Katherine is in the tomb.

28:00.310 --> 28:03.473
I know, but until we open that tomb,
I got her to play with.

28:03.647 --> 28:06.514
Don't be stupid.
That girl is with the Salvatore brothers.

28:06.684 --> 28:10.313
- They don't scare me. They never have.
- Please, Noah, don't do this.

28:10.487 --> 28:13.684
- You're gonna ruin everything.
- You got nothing to worry about.

28:13.857 --> 28:17.725
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
You will get what you came for.

28:18.562 --> 28:20.052
Just let me have my fun.

28:23.167 --> 28:25.567
She looks like Katherine.

28:43.554 --> 28:45.784
You really can't take him anywhere,
can you?

28:45.956 --> 28:48.117
Uh, no.

28:51.695 --> 28:55.096
Stefan, the back corner.

28:59.336 --> 29:00.360
Get Damon.

29:19.189 --> 29:21.657
- What did I do?
- Where is he?

29:21.825 --> 29:24.794
I was getting a soda,
and then this guy gave me his hoodie.

29:33.604 --> 29:34.866
Hello, Elena.

29:36.874 --> 29:38.501
Here's what you're going to do.

29:39.042 --> 29:41.374
There's an exit door behind you.

29:41.612 --> 29:44.012
- You have five seconds.
- No.

29:44.181 --> 29:46.649
Or your brother dies.

29:47.251 --> 29:50.550
I can snap his neck so fast,
I bet there's not even a witness.

29:50.721 --> 29:53.485
- Now, start walking.
- Don't you dare touch him.

29:53.657 --> 29:55.022
Keep walking.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.388
Through the door.

31:12.369 --> 31:14.303
Hey, dickhead.

31:14.972 --> 31:17.270
Nobody wants to kill you.
We just wanna talk.

31:26.316 --> 31:29.149
- Now you feel like talking?
- Screw you.

31:31.955 --> 31:33.354
Wrong answer.

31:33.523 --> 31:35.013
Why are you doing this?

31:35.525 --> 31:36.583
Because it's fun.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.762
What do you want with Elena?

31:43.467 --> 31:44.991
She looks like Katherine.

31:48.639 --> 31:50.072
You knew Katherine?

31:50.240 --> 31:51.502
Aw...

31:51.675 --> 31:53.370
You thought you were the only ones.

31:55.612 --> 31:57.239
You don't even remember me.

31:57.414 --> 31:59.644
Tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?

32:00.250 --> 32:01.444
No.

32:08.258 --> 32:10.192
- The grimoire.
- Well, where is it?

32:15.165 --> 32:17.656
Check the journal. The journal.

32:18.201 --> 32:21.329
Use Johnathan's journal.
Johnathan Gilbert's.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.774
Who else is working with you?

32:32.349 --> 32:35.580
Who else is there?
No.

32:36.219 --> 32:37.652
You're gonna have to kill me.

33:03.213 --> 33:06.376
What...? What do...?
How are you gonna find the others now?

33:06.550 --> 33:08.916
- He had to die.
- But...

33:09.353 --> 33:11.014
Elena...

33:11.188 --> 33:12.849
...he's been invited in.

33:21.365 --> 33:22.457
Go. I got this.

33:34.845 --> 33:36.779
- Hey.
- What were you doing?

33:37.781 --> 33:40.909
- Looking for Miss Hilden.
Why are you in Mystic Falls?

33:41.084 --> 33:43.211
Got a job as a teacher.
- Do you know what I am?

33:43.387 --> 33:46.151
My student's brother.
- You're telling me the truth?

33:46.356 --> 33:49.848
- Yes.
- Then forget we had this conversation.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.079
No way that idiot was working alone.

34:12.581 --> 34:13.606
You are.

34:15.652 --> 34:19.143
So the grimoire, it was Emily's, right?

34:19.322 --> 34:21.313
That's what you need
to reverse the spell?

34:21.491 --> 34:23.958
The founding families burned her,
took her things...

34:24.127 --> 34:27.619
...and you were hoping that
Dad's journal would tell you where it is.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.831
Look at you
putting the pieces together.

34:31.835 --> 34:35.293
Good for you. I was half right.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.971
Well, it's out there now.

34:38.175 --> 34:39.402
Let the games begin.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.476
- My offer still stands.
- With some hidden caveats, no doubt.

34:43.647 --> 34:47.606
No. Nothing hidden about it.
No lies. No deception.

34:47.784 --> 34:52.118
I'm there when you open up that tomb,
you and Katherine go...

34:52.289 --> 34:54.018
...and the other 26 vampires die.

34:54.190 --> 34:56.284
- Lf I agree?
- I'll help you.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.654
Why should I trust you?

34:57.828 --> 35:00.296
- I'm your brother.
- No, that's not gonna cut it.

35:00.464 --> 35:02.329
Because I want you gone.

35:09.372 --> 35:10.805
Okay.

35:16.713 --> 35:18.647
Look, I said something stupid.

35:18.815 --> 35:22.307
I'm sorry,
but I wasn't even talking about you.

35:22.486 --> 35:24.511
Yes, you were, Caroline.

35:24.688 --> 35:27.316
Ben could easily be me.
We're just alike.

35:27.491 --> 35:30.392
That's not true.
Are you seriously mad about this?

35:32.062 --> 35:36.089
Matt, you know me.
Okay, I say stupid things without thinking...

35:36.266 --> 35:39.531
...and then I have to apologize
and take it back...

35:39.703 --> 35:42.672
...and I'm a terrible, awful person,
but I'm working on it.

35:42.839 --> 35:44.830
Look, can we just not do this
right now?

35:45.842 --> 35:47.104
Okay.

35:47.611 --> 35:49.101
When do you get off?

35:50.547 --> 35:53.539
Look, this thing we've got,
it's nice and it feels really good.

35:53.717 --> 35:55.685
And I know
you wanna take the next step...

35:55.852 --> 35:58.844
How do you know that?
Have you even asked me?

35:59.523 --> 36:01.047
I'm not over Elena.

36:02.993 --> 36:05.393
I don't... I mean, I don't know if I am...

36:05.562 --> 36:09.760
...but if we go there, then it could
mess things up and we might lose this.

36:09.933 --> 36:13.528
And this is the only good thing
I've got going for me right now.

36:13.703 --> 36:18.697
If it doesn't work, I'll just disappoint you
and hurt you and I don't wanna do that.

36:20.877 --> 36:22.811
Well, big problem, Matt...

36:23.013 --> 36:25.504
...because you took the next step
all by yourself...

36:25.682 --> 36:29.140
...and you played the whole thing out
in your head and decided to bail...

36:29.319 --> 36:30.911
...before even giving it a shot.

36:31.087 --> 36:35.285
So this really great thing that we have,
don't worry about losing it...

36:35.458 --> 36:36.891
...because it's already gone.

36:45.168 --> 36:47.432
Thank you. I needed that.

36:47.604 --> 36:49.094
Well, thank you for coming.

36:49.272 --> 36:52.264
I really appreciate it.
You made the evening much more...

36:54.644 --> 36:57.078
Well, you made it, period.

36:57.247 --> 36:58.441
Well, glad I could help.

36:58.615 --> 37:01.345
And thank you for putting up
with all that wife talk.

37:01.551 --> 37:05.419
I, heh, gotta stop doing that.
It doesn't bode well for dating.

37:06.790 --> 37:11.693
- Is that what this was, a date?
- No, definitely not a date.

37:11.861 --> 37:13.488
But Friday...

37:13.663 --> 37:17.622
...you, me, and dinner and a movie,
that could be a date.

37:19.202 --> 37:21.500
- How about it?
- Works for me.

37:21.671 --> 37:23.366
All right.

37:23.974 --> 37:26.534
You can talk about your wife
all you want.

37:26.710 --> 37:30.111
It's gonna take time to heal.
We should just be ourselves.

37:30.513 --> 37:33.778
Still, I think I'll keep the Isobel talk
to a minimum.

37:34.718 --> 37:36.879
- Isobel?
- Yeah. That was her name.

37:37.587 --> 37:39.145
Where was Isobel from?

37:39.322 --> 37:43.816
Virginia. I mean,
not too far from here, actually.

37:48.231 --> 37:50.290
Caroline.

37:50.467 --> 37:51.593
Care, get in the truck.

37:57.641 --> 37:58.801
What?

38:08.652 --> 38:10.847
This'll never work.

38:21.765 --> 38:23.892
Doing okay?

38:27.337 --> 38:29.567
Is it weird if I say yes?

38:30.173 --> 38:32.869
- Is it true?
- I should feel more upset...

38:33.043 --> 38:37.503
...or scared or something,
but I feel kind of exhilarated.

38:38.748 --> 38:41.683
It's the adrenaline.
You'll crash soon enough.

38:42.419 --> 38:44.444
Yeah, I guess.

38:44.654 --> 38:47.782
I fought back tonight. It felt good.

38:48.258 --> 38:51.694
- I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
- Still...

38:57.300 --> 39:01.031
I need to tell you something, and I don't
know how you're gonna feel about it.

39:02.539 --> 39:03.733
What?

39:05.108 --> 39:10.273
I told Damon that I'd help him
get into that tomb, get Katherine back.

39:10.447 --> 39:15.043
But it was a lie.
I let him believe that he could trust me.

39:17.287 --> 39:19.619
Then why would you be worried
about telling me?

39:19.789 --> 39:25.955
Because he can be very persuasive
and you two have bonded lately.

39:26.296 --> 39:28.389
That doesn't mean I trust him.

39:28.565 --> 39:32.763
It's gonna take a lot more
than just a road trip and a rescue...

39:32.936 --> 39:36.269
...for me to forget who Damon is
and everything he's done.

39:37.474 --> 39:42.343
I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena,
but I can't let him do it.

39:42.512 --> 39:46.414
Then don't.
And I'll help you, whatever it takes.

39:48.651 --> 39:50.414
Okay?

39:51.321 --> 39:53.084
Okay.

39:54.290 --> 39:56.224
Come here.

40:29.259 --> 40:30.624
Don't sneak up on me.

40:32.162 --> 40:33.254
You love it.

40:36.032 --> 40:37.056
Where's Noah?

40:37.267 --> 40:40.794
His obsession got the best of him
and so did the Salvatore brothers.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.904
- They killed him?
- Tortured and staked.

40:43.072 --> 40:44.562
You're not very upset.

40:44.774 --> 40:48.073
I warned him, Ben, and he was just
gonna screw everything up anyway.

40:48.278 --> 40:51.509
Let's be honest,
he wasn't exactly an asset.

40:51.714 --> 40:52.874
How'd you do?

40:53.049 --> 40:55.677
Oh, the witch is totally crushing
on me.

40:55.852 --> 41:00.983
- Did you get the journal?
- No, but I know where it is and I'll get it.
