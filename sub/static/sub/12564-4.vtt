<i>Previously, on</i> Royal Pains...
<i>Shelby Shackleford,</i>

00:03.188 --> 00:05.355
V.P. of Acquisitions
for Symphony Health.

00:05.377 --> 00:07.594
We want to buy Hankmed.

00:07.596 --> 00:09.095
This is a cease and desist order.

00:09.097 --> 00:10.597
"The use of the home
professional office"

00:10.599 --> 00:11.932
"shall be prohibited."

00:11.934 --> 00:14.184
- I'm gonna get even.
- Don't do it, Evan.

00:14.186 --> 00:15.886
I'm gonna run for village council.

00:15.888 --> 00:18.638
I cannot take this anymore!

00:18.640 --> 00:21.391
I miss the old Jeremiah,

00:21.393 --> 00:23.393
the one who was my friend.

00:23.395 --> 00:25.645
I'm gonna have a baby.

00:25.647 --> 00:28.615
You're gonna have a baby.

00:28.617 --> 00:30.901
I share more than a
surname with Boris.

00:30.903 --> 00:32.702
You have the same genetic disease.

00:32.704 --> 00:34.287
Hello, Hank.

00:34.289 --> 00:37.908
My cousin and I were quite close
at one time, but he jumped

00:37.910 --> 00:40.327
at the chance to hire Dima.

00:40.329 --> 00:43.029
You've been spending a lot
of time here, haven't you?

00:44.999 --> 00:47.867
Dima!

00:47.869 --> 00:49.302
You stay here with me, okay?

00:49.304 --> 00:51.922
You already died. Now it's my turn.

00:51.924 --> 00:54.257
Look... you still don't know
what Milos wants, right?

00:54.259 --> 00:56.726
But maybe I can offer him
something he needs.

01:04.937 --> 01:07.771
- Hank! Hey, let me help you.
- Shelby.

01:07.773 --> 01:08.855
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:08.857 --> 01:09.990
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09.992 --> 01:12.609
What a surprise. Bear claw?

01:12.611 --> 01:14.911
No, I'm a Southern girl.
I like 'em raised and glazed.

01:14.913 --> 01:17.063
Huh. Okay.

01:17.065 --> 01:20.066
So, I understand I'm on
your schedule later today

01:20.068 --> 01:23.286
to discuss Divya and Jeremiah's
impressions of Savannah General?

01:23.288 --> 01:24.538
Indeed you are.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.206
Will we be discussing how much
they loved it?

01:26.208 --> 01:28.341
You know, just so I
can come prepared.

01:28.343 --> 01:29.909
They called your
hospital down there

01:29.911 --> 01:31.795
nothing short of spectacular.

01:31.797 --> 01:33.380
Ugh, I feel a "but" coming.

01:33.382 --> 01:35.382
- But...
- Yep.

01:35.384 --> 01:38.418
We've been dealing with quite
a few big changes lately.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.854
I've been dealing with
a lot of change recently.

01:40.856 --> 01:43.106
I just got back from Budapest,
I was meeting a new patient

01:43.108 --> 01:46.476
there... who will require
a lot of my attention.

01:46.478 --> 01:47.978
- So, that's a "no."
- No.

01:47.980 --> 01:49.112
So, that's a "yes."

01:49.114 --> 01:51.398
No, uh, I just need some more time.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.616
I-I hope you understand.

01:52.618 --> 01:54.100
Actually, I don't.

01:54.102 --> 01:55.768
Anchoring yourself
to the stability of Symphony

01:55.770 --> 01:57.537
while you go through these changes

01:57.539 --> 01:59.205
seems like an ideal
situation to me.

01:59.207 --> 02:03.243
And, at some point, it may be,
but right now, I just...

02:03.245 --> 02:05.295
I can't commit to anything new.
Well, we want to move fast

02:05.297 --> 02:08.582
on incorporating concierge
medicine, with or without you.

02:08.584 --> 02:11.501
And I would hate to
be your competitor.

02:11.503 --> 02:13.620
So, if you can't join
them, crush them?

02:13.622 --> 02:14.954
Oh, no pressure.

02:14.956 --> 02:17.123
I'm sure it would be a while
before we crush you.

02:25.817 --> 02:29.235
Hey. You're in the Hamptons?

02:29.237 --> 02:31.655
Of course. Where do
you want to meet?

02:31.657 --> 02:35.442
Okay, I don't know that place.
What's the address?

02:35.444 --> 02:38.361
Great. I'll see you in ten.

02:46.287 --> 02:48.655
Marisa.

02:48.657 --> 02:51.591
Hank.

02:54.663 --> 02:55.795
It's good to see you.

02:55.797 --> 02:57.797
It's good to see you, too.

03:03.387 --> 03:06.339
- So.
- So.

03:06.341 --> 03:07.891
How are you?

03:07.893 --> 03:12.062
I'm... okay.

03:12.064 --> 03:14.030
Boris isn't doing well either.

03:16.684 --> 03:17.901
You know, I've known
for a while now

03:17.903 --> 03:21.020
that Boris's family
was dangerous, but...

03:21.022 --> 03:26.025
to see Dmitri brutally murdered
in the street?

03:26.027 --> 03:29.713
I just... I can't imagine losing
a brother like that.

03:29.715 --> 03:32.215
Or a patient.

03:32.217 --> 03:33.717
Yeah.

03:33.719 --> 03:37.053
Boris knows that, and he will
be forever grateful.

03:37.055 --> 03:38.538
If you weren't in Budapest,

03:38.540 --> 03:39.923
I think we both know
what could have happened.

03:39.925 --> 03:42.392
- Well, I...
- And, that's one of the reasons

03:42.394 --> 03:44.227
why I came here.

03:44.229 --> 03:46.346
I wanted to thank you personally
for doing everything

03:46.348 --> 03:47.981
you could do to save Dmitri's life.

03:47.983 --> 03:50.550
And to keep Boris from making
any rash decisions.

03:50.552 --> 03:53.153
I want to do more than that.

03:53.155 --> 03:56.072
I want to help Boris see Milos
arrested and put away for good.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.908
- There are risks.
- I know.

03:58.910 --> 04:01.027
We're not only talking about
our medical licenses here.

04:01.029 --> 04:02.278
I know.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.748
If Milos finds out
the clinical trial is fake...

04:04.750 --> 04:06.249
he could come after us.

04:06.251 --> 04:09.085
Which is why you don't
have to do this.

04:09.087 --> 04:11.838
You don't have to risk your life
or your career.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.239
Neither do you.

04:13.241 --> 04:16.091
- He's my husband.
- He's my friend.

04:16.094 --> 04:18.411
Despite everything,
he's still my friend.

04:18.413 --> 04:22.215
And there's very little
I wouldn't do for him.

04:22.217 --> 04:24.100
I'm in, Marisa.

04:24.102 --> 04:27.086
100%.

04:27.088 --> 04:29.088
Me too.

04:35.062 --> 04:38.064
So, after an unfortunate
72-hour hiccup,

04:38.066 --> 04:41.818
brought to us by the iron-fisted
rule of Blythe freakin' Ballard

04:41.820 --> 04:43.453
over the village council,

04:43.455 --> 04:46.039
Hankmed is back.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.274
But, we still can't
see patients here,

04:48.276 --> 04:49.826
which is actually the perfect segue

04:49.828 --> 04:51.828
for me to tell you all
something very important.

04:55.299 --> 04:57.300
I'm running for village council.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.007
Good luck, Evan.

05:04.009 --> 05:05.425
Thank you, Jeremiah.

05:05.427 --> 05:07.260
Thank all of you.

05:07.262 --> 05:10.129
Uh, okay! Let's do this.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.932
Hank, you are meeting
with Shelby later today.

05:11.933 --> 05:13.483
Actually, I ran into her.

05:13.485 --> 05:17.487
She said if we can't make up our
minds, Symphony might move on.

05:17.489 --> 05:19.022
Yeah, that's a negotiating tactic.

05:19.024 --> 05:21.574
She wants us, bad. We're fine.

05:21.576 --> 05:25.028
Okay.

05:25.030 --> 05:27.146
So, I think that's all
the new business.

05:27.148 --> 05:29.032
Actually, no, Divya.

05:29.034 --> 05:30.149
Paige has something
that she would like to say.

05:30.151 --> 05:32.985
I have an appointment today.

05:32.987 --> 05:35.338
An interview, actually.
For an incredibly

05:35.340 --> 05:37.156
prestigious internship
with Russell Berger,

05:37.158 --> 05:39.709
the number one specialist
at Sutton and Chesterfield's.

05:39.711 --> 05:42.679
Oh, he's probably interviewing
50 people from Parsons alone,

05:42.681 --> 05:45.348
and there's no way he's gonna
hire a first-year student,

05:45.350 --> 05:49.219
but still, I gotta go... mwah...
and not get it.

05:49.221 --> 05:51.170
So, bye!

05:51.172 --> 05:52.522
- Good luck, babe.
- Go get 'em, Paige!

05:54.008 --> 05:56.342
So, if there's nothing else...

05:56.344 --> 05:58.394
Hank! We haven't heard
your Budapest report yet.

05:58.396 --> 05:59.729
How was your trip?

05:59.731 --> 06:02.031
Did you bring home
any pictures or souvenirs?

06:02.033 --> 06:05.034
Goulash recipes?

06:05.036 --> 06:08.571
I met Boris's cousin, Milos.

06:08.573 --> 06:11.541
He may become a patient.

06:11.543 --> 06:13.409
That's it?

06:13.411 --> 06:15.027
That's it.

06:15.029 --> 06:16.696
Okay.

06:16.698 --> 06:18.464
All right, good.
That about does it.

06:18.466 --> 06:20.667
Meeting... adjourned.

06:20.669 --> 06:23.670
Thanks, guys.

06:23.672 --> 06:25.371
Wait, Divya is trying
to tell you she's pregnant.

06:29.209 --> 06:32.178
Whoops.

06:34.047 --> 06:36.900
I guess this is what they mean
by a pregnant pause.

06:36.902 --> 06:39.435
- Oh, my...
- Congratulations!

06:39.437 --> 06:42.021
That's... so exciting!

06:43.992 --> 06:45.325
Sorry.

06:45.327 --> 06:47.944
Yeah.

06:47.946 --> 06:50.496
Oh! Okay, you're choking me.

06:50.498 --> 06:54.200
- Oh! I'm so happy for you.
- Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

06:54.202 --> 06:55.869
Yeah, I...

06:55.871 --> 06:58.454
I don't know where to start.

06:59.924 --> 07:02.258
Except to say, possibly
we should discuss this later.

07:14.438 --> 07:16.439
Oh, boy.

07:23.030 --> 07:25.815
- You okay?
- How did this happen?

07:25.817 --> 07:28.151
Well, when a boy and a girl
have unprotected...

07:28.153 --> 07:30.536
No, don't... wha...

07:31.823 --> 07:34.991
How could Divya tell
Jeremiah before me?

07:34.993 --> 07:36.876
I thought we were family, Henry.
I thought...

07:36.878 --> 07:38.044
we were talking about Divya.

07:38.046 --> 07:41.331
We are... we're talking
about Divya, okay?

07:41.333 --> 07:42.799
Who's always been there for Divya?

07:42.801 --> 07:43.967
- Me!
- Oh.

07:43.969 --> 07:46.219
That's who, me.

07:46.221 --> 07:48.254
When she broke off
her arranged marriage, me.

07:48.256 --> 07:50.173
When her family disowned her, me.

07:50.175 --> 07:52.725
When she was in financial
trouble, I was right there!

07:52.727 --> 07:56.312
I'm like her best friend/
brother/father figure.

07:56.314 --> 07:58.965
And she goes and she
tells Jeremiah?

07:58.967 --> 08:00.233
Evan.

08:00.235 --> 08:02.735
Divya is going through
a huge change in her life.

08:02.737 --> 08:03.987
I mean, you saw her.

08:03.989 --> 08:06.639
She was completely off-balance,
just left.

08:06.641 --> 08:09.993
Listen, we cannot freak out on her.

08:09.995 --> 08:13.029
And we can't freak her out.

08:13.031 --> 08:14.580
You're right.

08:14.582 --> 08:17.500
Totally, you're absolutely right.

08:17.502 --> 08:20.954
It just doesn't make any sense.
Jeremiah? Really?

08:20.956 --> 08:23.155
Okay, maybe while you're still
wrapping your head around this,

08:23.157 --> 08:26.926
you should just give her
some room to breathe.

08:26.928 --> 08:29.495
I'm just not ready to have a baby.

08:34.769 --> 08:36.352
Get it. Oh!

08:36.354 --> 08:39.522
Good boy!

08:39.524 --> 08:40.857
- That's good.
- Maya?

08:40.859 --> 08:42.674
Hi, hunter. Oh, hi.

08:42.677 --> 08:44.277
I'm Divya from Hankmed.

08:44.279 --> 08:46.529
Oh, hey, just give me one second.

08:46.531 --> 08:48.531
Go on, get it.

08:54.187 --> 08:56.205
Oh, hey, George!

08:56.207 --> 08:58.691
Hi! George, sit.

08:58.693 --> 09:02.211
Oh! What a good listener!

09:02.213 --> 09:03.362
You're getting so good at that.

09:03.364 --> 09:05.048
Hank.

09:05.050 --> 09:06.249
What are you doing here?

09:06.251 --> 09:08.034
Oh, you know, I was
in the neighborhood.

09:08.036 --> 09:09.252
Thought you might need a hand.

09:09.254 --> 09:11.804
- With a dog bite?
- Yeah, sure.

09:11.806 --> 09:13.222
Okay.

09:13.224 --> 09:17.093
Well, you guys brought a lot
of manpower for a little nip.

09:17.095 --> 09:18.261
Uh, let's take a look, shall we?

09:18.263 --> 09:20.263
Oh, yeah.

09:24.551 --> 09:28.237
Oh, wow. That's gotten a lot worse.

09:28.239 --> 09:30.056
Maya, the dog that bit you,

09:30.058 --> 09:32.909
can we see the vaccination record?

09:32.911 --> 09:34.560
I don't have it.

09:34.562 --> 09:36.746
Nobody does.

09:36.748 --> 09:39.532
It was a stray.

09:47.001 --> 09:49.078
When it got a little red,
I called the dog's owners,

09:49.102 --> 09:50.954
but they were out of
town with the dog.

09:50.986 --> 09:53.436
Their housekeeper said they
found him on the road last week.

09:53.438 --> 09:55.143
Do you think it's rabies?

09:55.167 --> 09:57.450
The odds of rabies are very slim.

09:57.452 --> 09:58.785
This happened three days ago?

09:58.787 --> 10:01.087
I know, I should have called
you guys earlier,

10:01.089 --> 10:02.339
but I always get a
little scratched up

10:02.341 --> 10:03.707
playing with the dogs.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.825
Well, Maya, this is more than
a little scratch.

10:05.827 --> 10:07.160
And so are those scars.

10:07.162 --> 10:09.763
- Occupational hazard.
- Yep.

10:09.765 --> 10:12.382
This is quite a place.
Looks like a lot of work.

10:12.384 --> 10:14.134
I have part-time help,
but these guys,

10:14.136 --> 10:15.635
they need full-time love
and attention, you know?

10:15.637 --> 10:17.637
- Right.
- Oh, there's Bono.

10:17.639 --> 10:19.105
Hank, say hello to Bono.

10:19.107 --> 10:20.774
What's up, Bono. Give me five.

10:20.776 --> 10:23.560
- He gave me five!
- Good boy.

10:23.562 --> 10:28.014
Very impressive, Maya.
Good boy.

10:30.785 --> 10:32.185
100.5.

10:32.187 --> 10:33.686
I have a fever?

10:33.688 --> 10:36.156
Your wound looks like a simple
bacterial infection,

10:36.158 --> 10:38.291
and that can produce a temperature,

10:38.293 --> 10:39.826
so we'll give you some augmentin
to help.

10:39.828 --> 10:41.544
And take blood and saliva samples,

10:41.546 --> 10:42.746
make sure there's
nothing we're missing,

10:42.748 --> 10:44.998
and give you a rabies shot.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.217
Just to be on the safe side.

10:47.219 --> 10:49.085
Okay.

10:58.045 --> 11:01.314
Look, I know, you're right.
I totally understand,

11:01.316 --> 11:03.516
- Paige... Paige...
- But listen, Evan... Evan...

11:03.518 --> 11:05.435
Evan, Evan, I gotta go.

11:05.437 --> 11:06.936
I know you're freaking
out about Divya,

11:06.938 --> 11:08.521
but I'm freaking out about
this interview,

11:08.523 --> 11:10.690
and we can't both be freaking
out at the same time.

11:10.692 --> 11:14.411
So, could you just put
your freak out on pause?

11:14.413 --> 11:16.780
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

11:16.782 --> 11:19.833
- Okay, I love you. Bye.
- I love you, too. Bye.

11:26.124 --> 11:29.909
Hi, Mr. Berger. I'm Paige Lawson.

11:29.911 --> 11:31.511
You're early.

11:31.513 --> 11:34.881
That's just as much of
an inconvenience as being late.

11:34.883 --> 11:36.883
Oh.

11:38.252 --> 11:42.022
Okay. Uh, well, let
me begin by saying

11:42.024 --> 11:43.306
it is an absolute honor

11:43.308 --> 11:45.308
to finally meet you in person,
Mr. Berger.

11:45.310 --> 11:46.893
It's pronounced "Bear-jhay."

11:46.895 --> 11:50.063
B-e-r-g-e-r, Bear-jhay.

11:50.065 --> 11:55.035
Of course.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Bear-jhay.

11:55.037 --> 11:56.953
You have a, um, a lovely home.

11:56.955 --> 11:58.488
I do, but this isn't it.

11:58.490 --> 12:01.791
This is a client's home that
I'm cataloguing for auction.

12:01.793 --> 12:04.110
They're renovating in the hopes
of selling it.

12:04.112 --> 12:07.464
Financial times being
what they are and all.

12:07.466 --> 12:09.249
Yes.

12:09.251 --> 12:12.419
All right, let's get started.

12:15.057 --> 12:19.759
Hank, what are you
really doing here?

12:19.761 --> 12:21.394
I just want to be here
for you, you know?

12:21.396 --> 12:22.795
In case you need anything.

12:22.797 --> 12:25.648
That's very sweet,
but I am all set.

12:25.650 --> 12:27.467
I'm sure you are,
but there are a lot of things

12:27.469 --> 12:28.818
you may not have considered.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.937
Like, I know it's gonna be tough
for you to tell Rafa.

12:30.939 --> 12:32.138
Wait, it is Rafa's?

12:32.140 --> 12:34.741
Yes, Hank, Rafa is the father.

12:34.743 --> 12:36.109
Of course he is.

12:36.111 --> 12:37.277
Well, I think the
sooner you tell him,

12:37.279 --> 12:38.811
the better you'll feel.

12:38.813 --> 12:40.646
We could do it together.

12:40.648 --> 12:43.199
I mean, you'll do it,
but I can stand next to you.

12:43.201 --> 12:45.785
Thank you.
I've already spoken with Rafa.

12:45.787 --> 12:47.620
- Oh.
- And I made it clear

12:47.622 --> 12:50.790
that I have no expectations of him.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.792
We have a lot of
details to work out...

12:52.794 --> 12:55.795
finances, visitations...
though, given his schedule,

12:55.797 --> 12:57.547
he won't be around
much and frankly,

12:57.549 --> 12:58.998
I am relieved about that.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.600
Got it. Good.

13:00.602 --> 13:02.002
- Great.
- Now we should think about

13:02.003 --> 13:04.471
how to tell your family.

13:04.473 --> 13:06.839
For now, I'm not telling them
or anyone else

13:06.841 --> 13:09.109
until the end of my
first trimester.

13:09.111 --> 13:10.977
And that was gonna be
my next piece of advice.

13:10.979 --> 13:12.812
Then we are totally in sync. Bye!

13:12.814 --> 13:15.515
Youuh... o... yeah. Okay.

13:20.038 --> 13:21.905
All right, don't forget
to join us today,

13:21.907 --> 13:24.124
Kiki and G, for our annual

13:24.126 --> 13:26.292
wet and wild
"life's a beach" party,

13:26.294 --> 13:30.130
with very special guest,
radio host and fellow loudmouth,

13:30.132 --> 13:31.697
Craig Carton.

13:33.668 --> 13:34.884
Dude, you sound like Demi Moore

13:34.886 --> 13:37.003
when she used to
smoke a pack a day.

13:37.005 --> 13:39.672
That's because I lost my voice
while yelling at you.

13:39.674 --> 13:41.341
Folks, in case you missed it,

13:41.343 --> 13:43.810
yesterday G got stuck
in the elevator,

13:43.812 --> 13:46.729
and I had an intern flood it
with packing peanuts,

13:46.731 --> 13:48.014
and then...

13:48.016 --> 13:50.817
Help me! I can't breathe!

13:50.819 --> 13:53.770
Okay, I have had issues
with confined spaces ever since

13:53.772 --> 13:55.355
you locked me in the trunk
of your car junior year.

13:55.357 --> 13:59.225
Uh, yes, claustrophobia is
a legitimate anxiety disorder.

13:59.227 --> 14:01.528
It can lead to serious
panic attacks.

14:01.530 --> 14:04.030
- Huh.
- Uh, who the hell are you?

14:04.032 --> 14:05.165
Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.533
I called him.

14:06.535 --> 14:09.953
Oh, a doctor who does house calls?

14:09.955 --> 14:12.238
And he's got that sexy physician
thing going on, too.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.674
- It's hot!
- No, bad Kiki, bad Kiki.

14:14.676 --> 14:16.042
He's a real doctor.

14:16.044 --> 14:18.294
All right, we're gonna break
for our sponsors.

14:18.296 --> 14:19.796
Hey, we'll be right back with more

14:19.798 --> 14:22.432
on Kiki and G's A.M. eargasm.

14:27.105 --> 14:29.389
Hey, I'm Garrett.
My throat really does hurt,

14:29.391 --> 14:31.274
and a DJ losing his voice
is not good radio.

14:31.276 --> 14:33.193
Oh, all right. Let's get started.

14:33.195 --> 14:35.228
All right.

14:40.367 --> 14:42.151
- Hey.
- Hi!

14:42.153 --> 14:44.270
I got your "911" text.
What's wrong?

14:44.272 --> 14:46.823
Sit. Sit, please.

14:48.459 --> 14:49.609
Nothing's wrong, okay?

14:49.611 --> 14:51.127
At all, nothing.

14:51.129 --> 14:53.663
There is nothing for you
to freak out about, Divya.

14:53.665 --> 14:57.300
- Why would I freak out?
- You wouldn't.

14:57.302 --> 15:00.169
Okay, so, I called you here today

15:00.171 --> 15:02.722
because I've been thinking a lot,

15:02.724 --> 15:06.392
and my life has been
so full lately,

15:06.394 --> 15:08.961
with getting married,
and moving into Shadow Pond,

15:08.963 --> 15:11.814
and Blythe Ballard, that I think

15:11.816 --> 15:16.069
I forgot to water the delicate
flower that is Divya,

15:16.071 --> 15:20.990
and that Divya flower
felt neglected.

15:20.992 --> 15:23.976
Okay, you're freaking Divya out.

15:23.978 --> 15:26.312
Okay, Divya, we need to reconnect.

15:26.314 --> 15:29.749
We are connected, okay?
But I'm really busy.

15:29.751 --> 15:31.451
I checked your schedule.
You have this hour free,

15:31.453 --> 15:33.620
so talk to me.

15:33.622 --> 15:37.006
Talk to me.

15:37.008 --> 15:39.876
Okay, what do you
want to talk about?

15:39.878 --> 15:43.296
About you.
Come on, about what's going on.

15:44.832 --> 15:46.633
All right, I'll start. I'll start.

15:46.635 --> 15:49.886
I read that pregnant women's
feet swell up like balloons.

15:49.888 --> 15:51.504
So, have you thought about
what you're gonna do

15:51.506 --> 15:52.855
with all your expensive shoes yet?

15:52.857 --> 15:54.274
Why, would you like
to stick your foot

15:54.276 --> 15:56.025
in your mouth stylishly?

15:56.027 --> 15:58.344
You see? Classic Divya/Evan.

15:58.346 --> 15:59.395
We're connecting.

15:59.397 --> 16:00.480
- This is what it's about.
- Yep.

16:00.482 --> 16:01.981
Why don't we talk about

16:01.983 --> 16:03.182
how big you're gonna get?
Like, ba-ba-bah-bum.

16:03.184 --> 16:05.034
- It's gonna be hilarious.
- Stop talking.

16:05.036 --> 16:06.819
Oh, if you're nervous about
the delivery at all,

16:06.821 --> 16:08.955
we can talk about that, too.
Because I saw a video,

16:08.957 --> 16:10.990
and it... it looks very painful.

16:10.992 --> 16:12.659
More painful than this?

16:12.661 --> 16:14.043
Than... oh.

16:14.045 --> 16:15.828
Okay, I've got to take this now.

16:15.830 --> 16:17.246
- Okay.
- Look, can we continue

16:17.248 --> 16:19.215
this conversation never?

16:22.670 --> 16:25.838
We can start a new conversation.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.807
You have got to fix him
by this afternoon.

16:27.809 --> 16:30.843
Craig Carton is our marquee guest.

16:30.845 --> 16:32.345
Boomer and Carton?

16:32.347 --> 16:34.880
Well, they're huge, which is why
I'm trying so hard

16:34.882 --> 16:37.266
to put some fun back into our show.

16:37.268 --> 16:39.736
Okay, we've moved on,
and our show is plenty of fun.

16:39.738 --> 16:41.404
Says the man enjoying
a spot of tea.

16:41.406 --> 16:43.323
Oh, Garrett, may I take a look?

16:43.325 --> 16:44.741
Yeah, it's just Earl Grey.

16:44.743 --> 16:46.526
This could be our one
chance with Craig.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.194
Who does sports?

16:48.196 --> 16:49.912
And stunts, on the radio?

16:49.914 --> 16:52.248
And he reached number one
in the arbitron ratings.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.734
He can help us get
to the next level.

16:54.736 --> 16:56.897
If Craig wants to help us,
he's gotta like us for us.

16:59.673 --> 17:00.906
And, we're back!

17:00.908 --> 17:02.342
What's the verdict
on G, Dr. Feelgood?

17:02.344 --> 17:04.242
Uh, he has acute laryngitis.

17:04.244 --> 17:06.262
I would rest your vocal cords
until the afternoon show,

17:06.263 --> 17:09.182
stick with the tea, and gargle
with warm salt water.

17:12.435 --> 17:14.587
So, can I just leave?

17:20.144 --> 17:22.261
Hey.

17:25.148 --> 17:28.701
- Didn't you get my message?
- I did, but I can handle it.

17:28.703 --> 17:30.453
Being pregnant doesn't mean
I can't do my job.

17:30.455 --> 17:32.438
Yeah, I know that, but I don't
want you to be exposed

17:32.440 --> 17:34.791
to something that would be
dangerous for your pregnancy.

17:34.793 --> 17:36.442
Oh, like what?

17:36.444 --> 17:38.628
Well, Maya's symptoms line up
with toxoplasmosis.

17:38.630 --> 17:39.996
This is called "The
Pampered Pooch."

17:39.998 --> 17:41.614
She boards dogs, not cats.

17:41.616 --> 17:43.082
Maybe she boards both.

17:43.084 --> 17:44.217
If she does, your health
could be at risk.

17:44.219 --> 17:45.551
Okay, how about this?

17:45.553 --> 17:48.755
I promise not to crawl into
a litter box.

17:48.757 --> 17:51.174
- Okay.
- Hey.

17:51.176 --> 17:53.059
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Absolutely.

17:53.061 --> 17:55.178
If those oral antibiotics
aren't working,

17:55.180 --> 17:56.846
we need to take a closer look.

17:56.848 --> 17:58.598
Maya, do you board cats here?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.733
No, we only cater to dogs.

18:00.735 --> 18:02.402
Huh.

18:02.404 --> 18:04.771
- Call me if you need any help.
- Yeah.

18:04.773 --> 18:07.774
- So, what's going on?
- Well, my fever is up to 102,

18:07.776 --> 18:11.277
and I have a headache,
and my neck is really stiff.

18:11.279 --> 18:12.612
Does that sound like rabies?

18:12.614 --> 18:14.980
They're much more likely
symptoms of meningitis.

18:14.982 --> 18:16.416
That doesn't sound much better.

18:16.418 --> 18:18.167
You'll need a spinal tap.

18:18.169 --> 18:20.002
Hank!

18:20.004 --> 18:21.621
I need your help.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.687
Oh, oh.
That's significant pressure.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.656
Tube.

18:28.658 --> 18:30.524
Significant how?

18:30.526 --> 18:35.713
Well, the tap seems clear,
but there's a buildup of fluid.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.382
We're gonna need to get
a C.T. scan of your head.

18:38.384 --> 18:39.967
My head? Why?

18:39.969 --> 18:44.371
We need to see what's causing
the extra spinal fluid pressure.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.556
There you go.

18:45.558 --> 18:49.143
But we're gonna be with you
the whole time.

18:53.047 --> 18:54.565
What is your experience with

18:54.567 --> 18:57.267
18th and 19th century
European antiques?

18:57.269 --> 18:59.436
Uh, I... I took a class.

18:59.438 --> 19:02.406
Um, it was on my resume.

19:03.692 --> 19:07.027
- Second semester I...
- Fine.

19:09.197 --> 19:12.916
Catalog this room and find me
when you're done.

19:16.571 --> 19:19.540
Um, do you want me to divide
northern European from Southern?

19:19.542 --> 19:22.376
Only if you want to
do it correctly.

19:31.419 --> 19:33.420
Okay, got it. Thank you.

19:38.693 --> 19:40.260
- Okay, it looks clear.
- Great.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.428
I'll go tell Maya.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.929
Eh, bup, bup... radiation.

19:42.931 --> 19:46.316
Honest to God, Hank,
the machine is off.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.285
Stop worrying. I'm okay.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.238
Okay. Don't work too late.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.439
Oh!

19:52.441 --> 19:53.774
I thought you might
be finished in here.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.960
I just wanted to show someone
our new equipment.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.412
Hey, guys.

19:58.414 --> 19:59.963
Of course, you two
know Dr. Van Dyke.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.948
- Of course we do.
- Hank.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.001
Good to see you, Paul.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.053
- Paul.
- Divya.

20:06.055 --> 20:07.337
I thought that you had moved
down to Miami

20:07.339 --> 20:08.672
when the E.R. shut down.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.091
I did, but I got a call from Shelby

20:11.093 --> 20:13.343
telling me that Symphony
was now in charge,

20:13.345 --> 20:15.012
and there were big changes
on the horizon.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.147
I told Paul about
our plans to start

20:17.149 --> 20:18.632
a concierge business here,

20:18.634 --> 20:20.184
and he jumped at the
chance to visit.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.802
- Hmm.
- She sent a private jet.

20:21.804 --> 20:22.986
- Mm.
- Who says no to that?

20:22.988 --> 20:24.405
- Right.
- Why don't I show you

20:24.407 --> 20:26.740
- our new doctors' lounge.
- Great.

20:26.742 --> 20:28.859
Guys, say hello to everyone
at home for me.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.194
Will do.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.829
Thanks again for
squeezing us through.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.814
Happy to help.

20:42.424 --> 20:43.874
Dr. Feelgood, you're back.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.209
Oh, it's Sacani.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.710
Garrett texted me. Is he around?

20:46.712 --> 20:49.162
Oh, yeah, he's taking a nap
before the beach party, so...

20:49.164 --> 20:51.365
I would just like to do
a quick checkup before you go.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.469
Garrett?

20:55.471 --> 20:57.971
Garrett.

20:57.973 --> 20:59.356
I just wan...

20:59.358 --> 21:02.676
Hey, Dr. Sacani, you came.

21:02.678 --> 21:06.063
Uh, you have something
on your face.

21:09.317 --> 21:11.568
Seriously?

21:11.570 --> 21:13.487
How are you doing?

21:13.489 --> 21:15.188
Oh, a little weak and dizzy.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.373
I'd like to retake your temperature

21:16.375 --> 21:18.325
and check your blood pressure.

21:18.327 --> 21:21.044
G, remember in college
when I passed out drunk

21:21.046 --> 21:22.663
at Burner Bailey's party?

21:22.665 --> 21:26.133
You drew a giant snake
on my face, with a sharpie.

21:26.135 --> 21:28.919
And you retaliated with
a facial drawing of your own.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.387
More lewd than a
snake, if I recall.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.340
You two met in college?

21:33.342 --> 21:34.925
We started a show together
at the college station.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.727
Most popular show on campus.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.346
And it's because we played pranks.

21:39.348 --> 21:40.514
People did love us.

21:40.516 --> 21:43.150
So now, you do me.

21:43.152 --> 21:45.719
We'll both look
ridiculous for Craig.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.321
We don't need to look ridiculous.

21:47.323 --> 21:48.405
All right, the material
we're doing right now

21:48.407 --> 21:49.573
is strong enough on its own.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.892
We need to maintain some integrity.

21:58.367 --> 22:02.035
Oh, come on, don't take it off.
It's funny.

22:02.037 --> 22:03.086
That's fine.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.122
I already tweeted it.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.674
Boom.

22:07.676 --> 22:09.176
"Bring all your friends
to Kiki and 'G's"

22:09.178 --> 22:10.544
"life's a beach party."

22:10.546 --> 22:13.597
"It'll be a drag without you."

22:13.599 --> 22:16.133
Doc, isn't it funny?

22:16.135 --> 22:18.135
Oh, sorry. Comedy isn't my field.

22:19.437 --> 22:22.272
Forget it.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.449
- Whoa! Um...
- Oh, sorry about that.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.701
Evan.

22:34.703 --> 22:36.069
What are you doing here?

22:36.071 --> 22:38.906
Well, when a woman is pregnant,

22:38.908 --> 22:40.123
she is going to have a...

22:40.125 --> 22:42.209
I'll tell you what
she's gonna have.

22:42.211 --> 22:44.444
She's gonna have a fit
when you buy her all this stuff.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.631
What... you cannot give
this cream to Divya.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.783
Of course I can. Every
woman needs it.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.336
It says so right here. It's for...

22:52.338 --> 22:54.504
Oh, my God.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.256
- Okay, a pee-pee teepee?
- Yes.

22:56.258 --> 22:57.925
- A pee-pee teepee?
- A pee-pee teepee.

22:57.927 --> 22:59.626
You don't know that
she's having a boy.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.478
- Girls pee-pee too.
- Not in a teepee.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.063
- What?
- I told you not to freak out,

23:03.065 --> 23:04.648
and yet here you are
in this baby store with...

23:04.650 --> 23:06.483
with a carriage full of freak out.

23:06.485 --> 23:07.985
This is gonna overwhelm her.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.803
You always overreact
when there are big changes,

23:09.805 --> 23:10.938
since you were a kid.
It's what you do.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.906
Don't go there, okay? I'm not ten.

23:12.908 --> 23:14.524
You can't just send me out to play.

23:14.526 --> 23:15.943
Okay, shh. We're in a baby store.

23:15.945 --> 23:18.745
- Oh, thank you very much.
- I'm sorry.

23:18.747 --> 23:22.482
But Evan, this is Divya. Our Divya.

23:22.484 --> 23:26.119
And this baby, this life,

23:26.121 --> 23:30.958
it's... it's all so
much bigger than us.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.961
We have to make them both
feel safe and protected.

23:35.296 --> 23:39.182
I understand that. I do, all right?

23:39.184 --> 23:40.667
At least, I'm trying
to understand it.

23:40.669 --> 23:44.054
Okay, okay. Then try
to understand that

23:44.056 --> 23:47.107
this is not what Divya needs.

23:49.277 --> 23:52.229
All right.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.231
What does she need?

24:01.689 --> 24:04.124
I have no idea.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.128
Hey, Paul, how was your tour
of the hospital?

24:08.130 --> 24:09.796
- Uh, impressive.
- Hmm.

24:09.798 --> 24:11.197
Had I known six months ago

24:11.199 --> 24:12.532
Symphony was gonna
rescue this place,

24:12.534 --> 24:13.884
I never would have bailed to Miami.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.202
Ah, yes, Miami must be
torturous for you,

24:16.204 --> 24:17.537
what with year-round sunshine

24:17.539 --> 24:19.706
and all those models
on South Beach.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.391
Okay, you're right.
It's pretty great.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.344
But now, opportunity
is knocking here.

24:24.346 --> 24:25.812
Hey, I've got some
time before golf.

24:25.814 --> 24:26.930
You want to grab a bite?

24:26.932 --> 24:30.484
No, thank you. I am swamped.

24:30.486 --> 24:32.385
I mean, this whole summer
has been crazy.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.905
Crazy good, or just crazy crazy?

24:34.907 --> 24:38.692
- Crazy... different.
- All right.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.694
Well, whatever is going on,
it's working for you.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.362
You look great.

24:42.364 --> 24:45.532
You're practically glowing.
And I'm not just saying that

24:45.534 --> 24:46.833
so you'll say I look great, too,

24:46.835 --> 24:48.234
'cause I'm comfortable
with how I look.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.870
You look great, too.

24:49.872 --> 24:51.705
Is it my hair?
'Cause I got a new shampoo...

24:51.707 --> 24:53.874
- Okay, I have to go.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

24:53.876 --> 24:56.960
How about after golf?
A girl's gotta eat.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.746
- No, thank you.
- Appletinis by the pool?

24:59.748 --> 25:01.081
Oh, probably not a good idea.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.133
Come on, what's your excuse?
Boyfriend?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.936
Pregnant.

25:08.255 --> 25:10.640
Okay.
Okay.

25:10.642 --> 25:12.776
Look, if you don't want
to go out with me,

25:12.778 --> 25:15.729
a simple "no" would do the trick.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.597
Pregnant? Wow, that is a good one.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.099
I gotta say, I like the new you.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.452
You're more relaxed, less uptight.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.454
I'll see you around.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.857
Your scan was clear, but your
temperature is still elevated,

25:35.859 --> 25:39.160
so we'd like to put you on some
broad-spectrum antibiotics

25:39.162 --> 25:43.081
which are more powerful than the
earlier medications we gave you.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.815
Can I take those at home?

25:44.817 --> 25:46.951
I really need to get back
to running the pooch.

25:46.953 --> 25:49.921
The antibiotics have to be
administered intravenously,

25:49.923 --> 25:52.590
and they can keep a close eye
on you here

25:52.592 --> 25:54.492
while we're waiting
for your blood cultures

25:54.494 --> 25:56.043
and your L.P. test results.

25:56.045 --> 25:59.430
All the tests you've run
so far have come back negative.

25:59.432 --> 26:02.266
What about the rabies test?

26:02.268 --> 26:04.552
That takes a little longer,
but honestly,

26:04.554 --> 26:06.187
we are not headed there yet.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.189
"Yet."

26:08.191 --> 26:11.359
Rabies is always fatal, right?

26:11.361 --> 26:14.345
And you can't stop it.
I read that online.

26:14.347 --> 26:18.516
So, if this is it, I don't want
to be stuck here.

26:18.518 --> 26:20.034
I want to be home with my dogs.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.870
Maya, the odds that
it's rabies are quite small.

26:22.872 --> 26:26.707
Somebody has to be
that odd statistic!

26:26.709 --> 26:28.292
I know that you're frightened,

26:28.294 --> 26:29.827
and I know that you want
to get back to business...

26:29.829 --> 26:32.046
It's not just about business.

26:32.048 --> 26:35.866
Look, I know it seems like
I'm going off the deep end here,

26:35.868 --> 26:39.220
but ever since I was little,

26:39.222 --> 26:42.590
the only thing that's helped
when I'm scared is my dogs.

26:42.592 --> 26:44.926
They're more than
just my livelihood.

26:44.928 --> 26:47.178
When I'm with them, I feel safe.

26:47.180 --> 26:50.014
I feel the same way about my job.

26:50.016 --> 26:51.849
But you're not going to be able
to take care of your dogs,

26:51.851 --> 26:53.851
if you don't take care of yourself.

27:00.659 --> 27:03.244
Hey, Evan, it's me.
Sorry I couldn't talk earlier.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.696
This job interview
has turned out to be

27:05.698 --> 27:07.915
a lot more job than interview.
Okay, what's up?

27:07.917 --> 27:11.569
But don't worry, I am still
on top of everything.

27:12.622 --> 27:14.005
You know, that would
be a lot funnier

27:14.007 --> 27:16.541
if you could actually
see me right now.

27:16.543 --> 27:18.242
Well, I can see you now,

27:18.244 --> 27:20.077
and I'm not amused in the least.

27:20.079 --> 27:23.080
- This is not our home.
- Paige? Paige?

27:23.082 --> 27:25.099
We do not make
ourselves comfortable

27:25.101 --> 27:27.218
under a Louis Cannes's desk.

27:30.255 --> 27:33.257
Ow.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.731
All right!

27:40.733 --> 27:42.266
And we're back

27:42.268 --> 27:45.403
at the life's a beach
party for K.I.Y.Z.

27:45.405 --> 27:50.374
- With Kiki, uh-oh!
- And G-G-G-G! G.

27:50.376 --> 27:51.492
And a very special guest today.

27:51.494 --> 27:52.627
Wow. Oh, my God.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.412
The one, the only...

27:54.414 --> 27:56.964
Craig Carton!

27:56.966 --> 27:58.299
Are you guys all right?

27:58.301 --> 27:59.667
- I don't know, Craig.
- Wow!

27:59.669 --> 28:01.669
I just want to say,
you're one attractive gentleman.

28:01.671 --> 28:03.421
Your skin looks so smooth.

28:03.423 --> 28:04.622
- Yeah, he is.
- Hang on one second.

28:04.624 --> 28:05.673
Listen, I'll talk football
with you guys,

28:05.675 --> 28:06.790
but we're not talking facials.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.342
I'm serious, man.

28:08.344 --> 28:09.644
You're... you're hot.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.811
I would totally make out with you.

28:10.813 --> 28:11.679
And we're definitely
not going there,

28:11.681 --> 28:13.297
- so back off.
- Okay.

28:13.299 --> 28:15.966
We'll see about that.

28:15.968 --> 28:17.801
- V.D.!
- Hey!

28:17.803 --> 28:19.186
Hey, I heard you were back in town.

28:19.188 --> 28:22.690
Yep, and happy to be.
Man, did I miss the Hamptons.

28:22.692 --> 28:24.191
Yeah, we missed you, too.

28:24.193 --> 28:25.526
Uh, let's just cut to the chase.

28:25.528 --> 28:27.478
Did Shelby offer you
the concierge job?

28:27.480 --> 28:29.580
Uh, not yet.
She wanted to show me around,

28:29.582 --> 28:32.083
get my thoughts first.
We're meeting again tomorrow.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.317
Hey, I'm curious.

28:33.319 --> 28:35.369
Why did you guys pass
on this Symphony deal?

28:35.371 --> 28:37.004
Did you hear something
dicey about them?

28:37.006 --> 28:38.873
No, they check out very well.

28:38.875 --> 28:42.209
And so do I, thanks to you.

28:42.211 --> 28:43.961
Pretty sure the only reason
she called is 'cause

28:43.963 --> 28:45.179
I used to work for Hankmed.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.381
- Well.
- Man, if I move back,

28:47.383 --> 28:48.599
we gotta hang out.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.851
Appletinis, okay? My place.

28:50.853 --> 28:52.503
See you, Paul.

28:52.505 --> 28:54.138
You told Shelby it was a pass?

28:54.140 --> 28:55.556
No, I said it was a "not now."

28:55.558 --> 28:56.941
You're the one who
said her moving on

28:56.943 --> 28:58.359
was just a negotiating tactic.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.528
No... now Van Dyke is here!

29:00.530 --> 29:02.863
- All right, easy.
- Well, are you ready to just

29:02.865 --> 29:04.231
lose this opportunity, then,

29:04.233 --> 29:05.516
along with some of
our business, too?

29:05.518 --> 29:06.734
I'll call her. I will call her.

29:06.736 --> 29:08.185
Well, good. Just come
up with something

29:08.187 --> 29:10.854
- better to say than "not now."
- Okay.

29:10.856 --> 29:13.374
I have to admit, I'm rather
flummoxed by my patient.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.526
- Which one?
- It's one of the DJs.

29:15.528 --> 29:17.328
He presented with acute laryngitis.

29:17.330 --> 29:18.746
He complained of
dizziness and weakness,

29:18.748 --> 29:19.863
and now he's exhibiting

29:19.865 --> 29:21.749
- bizarre and erratic behavior.
- Yeah.

29:21.751 --> 29:23.200
I used to listen to Kiki and G.

29:23.202 --> 29:24.969
That's their thing.
That's like their trademark.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.704
If anyone knows bizarre
and erratic behavior,

29:26.706 --> 29:28.372
- it's this guy.
- Eh.

29:28.374 --> 29:30.891
- Hey, what's up?
- Just checking up on a patient.

29:30.893 --> 29:32.393
Uh, should we move into the shade?

29:32.395 --> 29:33.644
It's a little bright... what?
Would you stop treating her

29:33.646 --> 29:35.045
like candy glass?

29:35.047 --> 29:36.213
She's pregnant, she's not
perishable, all right?

29:36.215 --> 29:37.431
I got your back, Divs.

29:37.433 --> 29:38.899
I don't need you to have my back,

29:38.901 --> 29:40.067
or any other part of me.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.320
- See?
- And I don't need any shade.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.404
- Oh.
- Nyah.

29:43.406 --> 29:46.357
- Nyah nyah nyah.
- Excuse me.

29:46.359 --> 29:47.858
Well, this is not getting better.

29:50.446 --> 29:52.530
Listen, trust your instincts.
Keep an eye on him.

29:52.532 --> 29:53.831
If you still think there's
a neuro problem,

29:53.833 --> 29:56.066
take him in for an MRI.

29:57.786 --> 30:00.037
Okay, that was the hospital.

30:00.039 --> 30:02.039
Maya's saliva tested negative
for rabies.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.207
- That's great news.
- Yes.

30:03.209 --> 30:04.759
But she checked herself out A.M.A.

30:04.761 --> 30:05.960
before the test results came back,

30:05.962 --> 30:07.595
and now no one can reach her.

30:07.597 --> 30:08.796
I'm gonna go to the Pampered Pooch.

30:08.798 --> 30:11.048
- Yep.
- And no help is necessary.

30:11.050 --> 30:12.633
- Okay, but I...
- Stay!

30:12.635 --> 30:14.935
Good boy.

30:14.937 --> 30:18.806
I'm supporting you from right here!

30:18.808 --> 30:20.424
I was just trying to help.

30:20.426 --> 30:22.226
She doesn't want help.
She says she wants space.

30:22.228 --> 30:24.895
When did she say that?

30:24.897 --> 30:26.731
When I asked her.

30:26.733 --> 30:30.401
You asked her?

30:30.403 --> 30:31.736
Huh.

30:39.161 --> 30:42.380
Maya!

30:42.382 --> 30:44.548
- Is anyone here?
- Divya, is that you?

30:48.336 --> 30:50.971
- Maya.
- Divya, I can't see you.

30:50.973 --> 30:52.973
I can't see anything!

30:55.539 --> 30:57.265
How are you so sure
it's not rabies?

30:57.297 --> 30:59.631
I... I'm blind.
I don't want to die.

30:59.633 --> 31:01.800
Try not to panic.
It is definitely not rabies.

31:01.802 --> 31:03.652
All of your tests
came back normal.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.154
I promise you, were going to
get to the bottom of this.

31:05.156 --> 31:07.105
Okay, here's Hank.

31:07.107 --> 31:09.107
Hey!

31:09.109 --> 31:11.109
Maya, we need to take you
to the hospital.

31:11.111 --> 31:13.195
- Come.
- But what about my dogs?

31:13.197 --> 31:15.864
Uh, I'll cover for you until
your assistant arrives.

31:15.866 --> 31:17.833
Okay, right this way.

31:17.835 --> 31:19.985
I'm just opening the door.

31:19.987 --> 31:21.837
Okay, okay, now...

31:21.839 --> 31:23.038
Putting you in the passenger seat.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.791
That's it. Okay.

31:25.793 --> 31:26.959
Thank you for coming so quickly.

31:26.961 --> 31:29.178
Of course.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.713
Maya! You're not gonna believe it.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.932
- Ruby needs you.
- Maya has another appointment.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.385
Well, Ruby got skunked, again.

31:36.387 --> 31:37.853
You think she would have
learned her lesson

31:37.855 --> 31:39.855
after she cornered
one two weeks ago.

31:39.857 --> 31:42.057
Abyssinians are famous
for their beauty,

31:42.059 --> 31:44.860
- not their smarts.
- Abyssinians.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.229
Hank, stop! I'll be right back.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.517
Maya, I thought you said
you didn't board cats?

31:52.519 --> 31:54.019
- I don't.
- Well, what about Ruby?

31:54.021 --> 31:55.988
- My neighbor's cat?
- Yes.

31:55.990 --> 31:58.040
I washed her once.

31:58.042 --> 32:00.242
Maya, did Ruby scratch you?

32:00.244 --> 32:02.044
Have you ever tried to wash a cat?

32:02.046 --> 32:04.496
Escalating fever, headaches,
loss of vision.

32:04.498 --> 32:05.664
- Everything lines up.
- You're right.

32:05.666 --> 32:07.583
Maya, I need to do a quick exam.

32:07.585 --> 32:09.718
Turn towards me, please.

32:12.338 --> 32:14.973
Raise your arms, please.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.708
Yep, swollen lymph nodes.

32:16.710 --> 32:18.376
What's going on?

32:18.378 --> 32:20.211
If we're right, you're
suffering from an infection

32:20.213 --> 32:22.064
caused by the bartonella bacteria,

32:22.066 --> 32:24.650
commonly known as
cat scratch fever.

32:24.652 --> 32:27.236
A scratch from a cat did all this?

32:27.238 --> 32:29.321
Yes, but we can start you on
a cycle of rifampin,

32:29.323 --> 32:31.356
to fight the infection,
and prednisone,

32:31.358 --> 32:33.659
to relieve the swelling
and to restore your vision.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.161
You're going to be all right, Maya.

32:41.869 --> 32:45.087
G, are you okay?

32:48.742 --> 32:50.709
That's definitely an altered
neurological state.

32:53.513 --> 32:56.181
G. G, I need to look at you.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.466
We're having fun up there.

32:57.468 --> 32:58.634
I just gotta keep my throat oiled.

32:58.636 --> 33:00.552
No, no, no.
That's the last thing he needs.

33:02.805 --> 33:04.089
Pulse is 30.
That's dangerously low.

33:04.091 --> 33:05.223
I would like to have you lo... oh!

33:05.225 --> 33:06.692
Oh, my... what? What, oh, my God.

33:06.694 --> 33:10.646
What... what... what is happening?
What is happening?

33:10.648 --> 33:13.282
- He's not breathing.
- What? What?

33:13.284 --> 33:15.784
G, hey.

33:15.786 --> 33:17.703
Wake up, okay.

33:20.740 --> 33:22.958
- Evan, come here, please.
- Yep.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.576
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, no, no, no.

33:24.578 --> 33:26.211
I can't believe this.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.946
Keep pumping, slow and steady,
every five to six seconds.

33:27.948 --> 33:29.581
- Got it.
- What is happening?

33:29.583 --> 33:31.216
What is happening?

33:31.218 --> 33:32.634
His pulse is weak and thready.
He's bradycardic.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.336
I have to get his heart sped up.
Will you call 911?

33:34.338 --> 33:35.754
Already done.

33:35.756 --> 33:39.007
- God, oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

33:41.844 --> 33:44.129
Okay, okay, G, G.

33:54.774 --> 33:57.609
Okay, pulse is coming back up.
You can stop.

33:57.611 --> 33:59.745
G? G, just lie still.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.413
The ambulance is on its way.

34:01.415 --> 34:04.333
G, I am so sorry. G,
I am so, so sorry.

34:04.335 --> 34:06.818
That's okay.
You didn't do anything.

34:06.820 --> 34:09.254
Did you replace his tea?

34:09.255 --> 34:12.290
It's not the tea.

34:12.292 --> 34:14.626
It's the honey.

34:14.628 --> 34:17.328
It was just supposed to be a joke.

34:23.668 --> 34:26.054
You didn't include
the Austrian Biedermeier.

34:26.056 --> 34:27.839
I assumed you wouldn't
be interested,

34:27.841 --> 34:31.009
since the mahogany inlay
is a restoration.

34:35.815 --> 34:38.065
Hmm.

34:38.068 --> 34:39.851
A rather vulgar one at that.

34:39.853 --> 34:42.036
Hmm.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.072
Why don't we...

34:44.074 --> 34:45.991
and by "we" I mean "you"...

34:45.993 --> 34:48.326
tackle the dining room next?

34:50.246 --> 34:53.998
Okay, I have been at this
interview all day,

34:54.001 --> 34:58.804
and you are still asking me
to do more to prove myself?

34:58.806 --> 35:00.205
I don't think so.

35:00.207 --> 35:02.540
This isn't an interview.

35:02.542 --> 35:04.059
This is your first day.

35:04.061 --> 35:05.210
I have the job?

35:05.212 --> 35:07.212
Unpaid internship.

35:07.214 --> 35:10.315
And given the masochistic streak
you've revealed today,

35:10.317 --> 35:12.901
toiling so hard to prove yourself,

35:12.903 --> 35:15.487
I see no need to fire you.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.272
Yet.

35:17.274 --> 35:18.857
You will not be disappointed.

35:18.859 --> 35:20.325
I am a very hard worker,

35:20.327 --> 35:21.893
and masochism has
nothing to do with it.

35:21.895 --> 35:23.061
Potato, pot-ah-to, my dear.

35:23.063 --> 35:25.396
But since I'm your boss
and not your therapist,

35:25.398 --> 35:27.499
I see no need to quibble.

35:31.070 --> 35:33.088
The rhododendron honey
you ordered online

35:33.090 --> 35:34.456
is also known as "mad honey."

35:34.458 --> 35:35.874
Yeah, it says here people take it

35:35.876 --> 35:38.093
to become aroused and hypersexual.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.745
Yes, but he overdosed.
The more tea he drank,

35:40.747 --> 35:41.847
the more toxic honey he consumed,

35:41.849 --> 35:42.931
the more his symptoms escalated.

35:42.933 --> 35:45.550
You gave him
grayanotoxin poisoning.

35:45.552 --> 35:47.969
It... it was just supposed
to loosen you up,

35:47.971 --> 35:49.771
make you a little crazy.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.257
Luckily, now that G has
stopped ingesting the poison,

35:52.259 --> 35:54.643
the effects will wear off.
He will need a cardiac work-up,

35:54.645 --> 35:56.895
but he should recover.

35:56.897 --> 35:59.097
Oh, G, I am so, so...

35:59.099 --> 36:01.283
So gonna owe me for this one.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.452
Abso-freakin'-lutely.

36:11.544 --> 36:15.947
Krishna, Shiva, Vishnu.

36:15.949 --> 36:18.116
That's not bad, we could
call it "Vish" for short.

36:18.118 --> 36:19.450
"It"?

36:19.452 --> 36:21.720
Have you noticed that
the mother-to-be isn't sparking

36:21.722 --> 36:23.889
to naming her baby
after a Hindu god?

36:23.891 --> 36:25.474
Hey, sorry I'm late.

36:25.476 --> 36:27.342
- Hi!
- I brought champagne.

36:27.344 --> 36:29.761
And cider.

36:29.763 --> 36:31.146
- Congratulations.
- Mm.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.848
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Paige!

36:32.850 --> 36:35.133
Thank you, guys.

36:35.135 --> 36:38.854
All right.

36:42.475 --> 36:43.859
- The champagne.
- Thank you, brother.

36:43.861 --> 36:45.994
- Cider.
- Thank you.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.946
- Evan.
- Thanks.

36:47.948 --> 36:51.366
Okay, we need a toast.

36:51.368 --> 36:53.335
Excuse me.

36:57.123 --> 37:00.258
To Divya.

37:02.128 --> 37:04.996
I think I can add to that.

37:04.998 --> 37:06.831
Uh, that was beautiful, Jeremiah.

37:09.336 --> 37:13.221
When I first met Divya...
her in a white pantsuit,

37:13.223 --> 37:16.141
me in my skivvies...

37:16.143 --> 37:18.109
I never would have imagined
the day would come

37:18.111 --> 37:21.346
when we would call you "mom."

37:21.348 --> 37:23.732
"Mama Divs."

37:23.734 --> 37:24.849
"Mamarishi."

37:24.851 --> 37:26.284
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.319
I think we got some
good options there.

37:27.321 --> 37:29.788
Sorry. I'm done.

37:29.790 --> 37:34.659
Divya... to you.

37:34.661 --> 37:36.694
We all love you,

37:36.696 --> 37:38.997
and we will always care for you.

37:38.999 --> 37:43.701
For both... for both...

37:43.703 --> 37:46.054
- Okay, okay. Yep. Mm-hmm.
- Both of you. Okay.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.589
Yep.

37:47.591 --> 37:49.591
I am going to make this toast.

37:53.564 --> 37:59.217
Since I found out this news,
I've been shocked,

37:59.219 --> 38:02.070
a little worried, elated,

38:02.072 --> 38:04.856
and possibly panicked.

38:04.858 --> 38:07.826
But, watching the
two Lawson brothers

38:07.828 --> 38:09.945
adjust to my new circumstances,

38:09.947 --> 38:12.113
I feel better about myself,

38:12.115 --> 38:15.166
because I thought that
I was a basket case.

38:15.168 --> 38:18.703
But now, I have seen
two real basket cases,

38:18.705 --> 38:20.622
and I realize that I have been
bloody grace under fire.

38:20.624 --> 38:22.740
Yes, you have.

38:25.744 --> 38:31.299
I want to thank you, my friends.

38:31.301 --> 38:33.635
Thank you for being yourselves,

38:33.637 --> 38:37.922
and for being properly thrown
by this huge change.

38:40.393 --> 38:45.397
I think with you beside me,
I can really, really do this.

38:46.482 --> 38:49.567
So... to us.

38:53.483 --> 38:55.483
- To us.
- To us.

39:06.843 --> 39:09.638
Hello. Um, all the tests indicate

39:09.654 --> 39:11.020
everything has
returned to normal.

39:11.022 --> 39:12.555
You should be
released later today.

39:12.557 --> 39:14.741
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much

39:14.743 --> 39:17.860
for saving my better
half, Dr. Sacani.

39:17.862 --> 39:19.245
We're going back to
being ourselves,

39:19.247 --> 39:20.914
and I promise to respect
G's boundaries.

39:20.916 --> 39:22.532
Mm-hmm. Good thing,
too, since we have

39:22.534 --> 39:24.167
a lot of work ahead of us
before we meet up

39:24.169 --> 39:25.735
with Craig Carton in the city.

39:25.737 --> 39:26.902
What?

39:26.904 --> 39:28.788
He's introducing us to his agent.

39:28.790 --> 39:30.757
So he actually liked
the show yesterday?

39:30.759 --> 39:32.175
- Mm-mm.
- No.

39:32.177 --> 39:33.876
But he was impressed enough
with our new demo reel

39:33.878 --> 39:35.911
that he's willing to forget
about that show.

39:35.913 --> 39:37.931
Yeah, he thinks a guy
and a girl being best friends

39:37.933 --> 39:40.216
and dissecting each other's
opposite lives

39:40.218 --> 39:41.851
- makes for good radio.
- Mm.

39:41.853 --> 39:44.420
- I wish I had thought of that.
- Mm.

39:47.308 --> 39:49.309
I... I still don't get them.

39:52.229 --> 39:56.149
Well, you certainly get Divya,
that's for sure.

39:56.151 --> 39:57.784
It seems like you've
progressed a lot,

39:57.786 --> 40:00.403
since you had that crush
on her last summer.

40:00.405 --> 40:01.604
I didn't have a crush on Divya.

40:01.606 --> 40:03.606
I was in love with her.

40:07.711 --> 40:11.214
I realize I was evasive
about that before.

40:11.216 --> 40:12.782
While I was away,
I thought it had passed,

40:12.784 --> 40:16.586
but then when I got back, I found that...

40:16.588 --> 40:19.455
I had some difficulty
concentrating.

40:19.457 --> 40:21.808
I attempted to maintain
an appropriate distance,

40:21.810 --> 40:23.593
but then in Savannah

40:23.595 --> 40:25.728
I realized Divya needed a friend,

40:25.730 --> 40:29.599
so I decided to be that.

40:31.486 --> 40:35.238
You know, Jeremiah,
she made the right choice,

40:35.240 --> 40:37.106
telling you first.

40:37.108 --> 40:41.527
Oh, I wasn't the first. Paige was.

40:41.529 --> 40:43.646
Okay, okay, okay.

40:43.648 --> 40:45.665
It's okay, Hank.
Don't help me or anything.

40:45.667 --> 40:47.667
Yeah, no, it looks like
you've got it under control.

40:47.669 --> 40:49.485
Seriously, could you take a few?

40:49.487 --> 40:50.653
Oh, that was my cue.

40:50.655 --> 40:51.987
Sorry, I'm trying to be
a better listener.

40:51.989 --> 40:54.156
- Yeah.
- Come here, boy.

40:54.158 --> 40:55.341
- Come here.
- Here they are.

40:55.343 --> 40:57.043
Oh, my God. Oh, come here, Hunter.

40:57.045 --> 40:59.662
Looks like your
vision is improving.

40:59.664 --> 41:01.831
The lab confirmed
cat scratch fever,

41:01.833 --> 41:04.050
but you're gonna be
fine and back at

41:04.052 --> 41:05.518
the Pampered Pooch in no time.

41:05.520 --> 41:08.170
Oh, I really appreciate you
bringing these guys to see me.

41:08.172 --> 41:10.223
Well, we know how much comfort
they bring you.

41:10.225 --> 41:11.724
Oh!

41:11.726 --> 41:13.893
Those are certified service
dogs, right, Dr. Lawson?

41:13.895 --> 41:16.646
Yes, they are, Dr. Shackleford.

41:16.648 --> 41:19.181
We do everything at
Hankmed by the book.

41:19.183 --> 41:22.035
My hospitality only extends
so far, Hank.

41:22.037 --> 41:23.519
Well, your hospitality has been

41:23.521 --> 41:24.954
nothing short of impressive.

41:24.956 --> 41:27.824
Well, I meant it when I said
patients come first at Symphony.

41:27.826 --> 41:30.827
And I believe you.

41:30.829 --> 41:32.712
Look, I know you're talking

41:32.714 --> 41:34.714
- to Dr. Van Dyke...
- Mm-hmm.

41:34.716 --> 41:36.833
But does that mean you're done
talking to Hankmed?

41:36.835 --> 41:38.501
Well, it depends on what
Hankmed is saying.

41:38.503 --> 41:39.802
So now it's a "yes"?

41:39.804 --> 41:42.872
It's still a "maybe,"
but an interested "maybe."

41:42.874 --> 41:45.040
- Mm-hmm.
- We'd like to get to know you.

41:45.042 --> 41:47.093
If you're open to it,
we'd like to rent some space

41:47.095 --> 41:50.430
at Hamptons Heritage, primarily
for your equipment and labs.

41:50.432 --> 41:52.315
Deal. But no rent.

41:52.317 --> 41:55.151
A free trial offer,
for a limited time.

41:55.153 --> 41:58.354
All this talking is gonna have
to lead to a decision, soon.

41:58.356 --> 41:59.522
I understand.

41:59.524 --> 42:00.890
Just out of curiosity,

42:00.892 --> 42:03.893
why are you so open to change
all of a sudden?

42:03.895 --> 42:06.162
Change is unavoidable.

42:06.164 --> 42:08.898
Sometimes you need to embrace it
rather than fight it.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.416
Hmm.

42:10.418 --> 42:12.067
So, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

42:12.069 --> 42:14.287
- Don't forget the donuts.
- Raised and glazed.

42:14.289 --> 42:16.905
Yep.
