07:04.825 --> 07:06.760
I TRIED.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.363
YES, BUT TO RESTORE A LIFE,
YOU MUST TAKE A LIFE--

07:10.464 --> 07:12.800
YEAH I KNOW,
GODDAMNIT, I KNOW !

07:12.900 --> 07:14.868
I TOOK HER OUT
WAY PAST EVERYONE--

07:14.968 --> 07:18.038
YOU MUST ACT AS A MAN
NOT A BOY.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.108
A BOY MENDS THE BROKEN
BONES OF HIS PLAYMATES

07:21.208 --> 07:25.212
AND RESURRECTS LITTLE KITTENS
FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.414
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.416
THIS IS
A WOMAN'S LIFE.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.418
A HUMAN LIFE.

07:31.519 --> 07:35.322
TO RESTORE IT,
YOU MUST TAKE A LIFE.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.457
WITH DELIBERATION.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.393
YOU MUST CHOOSE
THE LIFE YOU TAKE.

07:40.494 --> 07:44.131
THAT... IS THE WAY
OF OUR KIND.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.333
WHAT IS THIS ?

07:46.433 --> 07:49.637
WHAT'S HE
TALKING ABOUT ?

07:49.737 --> 07:51.639
I AIN'T HERE
TO PLAY GAMES

07:51.739 --> 07:53.541
WITH SOMEONE HIDING
BEHIND A CURTAIN !

07:53.641 --> 07:57.645
BEST KEEP A CIVIL TONGUE
IN YOUR HEAD, BOY.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.014
I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS--

08:01.114 --> 08:05.018
ANOTHER STEP AND I WILL
KILL YOU WHERE YOU STAND.

08:05.118 --> 08:09.857
THEN WHAT WILL BECOME OF
YOUR FRIEND, I WONDER.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.863
I CAN HELP YOU,
BEN HAWKINS.

08:15.963 --> 08:21.368
I CAN GIVE YOU
THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.403
WHO ARE YOU ?

08:23.503 --> 08:28.609
SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
THE LIFE YOU'VE LED.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.078
THE QUESTIONS
YOU HAVE.

08:31.178 --> 08:35.182
THE TORMENTS SOMEONE
WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT IS

08:35.282 --> 08:38.351
TO MAKE SUCH A CHOICE.

08:38.451 --> 08:42.222
ONE LIFE FOR ANOTHER.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.456
NO...

08:43.557 --> 08:46.727
YOU HAVE MADE
THIS CHOICE BEFORE.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.228
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
'BOUT THAT ?

08:48.328 --> 08:52.032
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF MAKING SUCH A CHOICE.

08:52.132 --> 08:56.403
CAPABLE OF SAYING
THIS ONE DESERVES TO LIVE,

08:56.503 --> 08:59.607
THIS ONE
DESERVES TO DIE.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.742
THAT AIN'T MY PLACE.

09:01.842 --> 09:06.914
IF THAT IS TRUE, MY FRIEND, THEN
WHY IS SUCH A CHOICE POSSIBLE ?

09:07.014 --> 09:11.284
WHY ARE YOU NOT
LIKE OTHER MEN ?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.387
LEFT BEHIND
TO BURY THE DEAD.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.024
TO MASH YOUR TEETH
AND CRY OUT TO GOD.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.359
WHY HER, LORD ?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.494
WHY NOT ANOTHER ?

09:21.595 --> 09:24.598
THE ANSWER
IS SELF EVIDENT.

09:24.698 --> 09:28.702
IT IS YOUR PLACE,
BEN HAWKINS.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.871
IT CANNOT
BE ESCAPED.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.642
IT CAN ONLY
BE ACCEPTED.

09:34.742 --> 09:39.613
HER LIFE
FOR ANOTHER'S.

09:39.713 --> 09:43.316
IT IS THE ONLY WAY.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.991
YOU MAY GO NOW.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.714
SUGAR ?

10:46.814 --> 10:49.883
YOU DIDN'T COME
TO BED LAST NIGHT...

10:49.983 --> 10:52.352
NO.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.158
YOU OKAY ?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.394
YOU AND ME.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.664
IT AIN'T WORKING.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.873
NO, IT AIN'T.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.476
I DON'T THINK
YOU WANT IT TO.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.345
ME ?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.013
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.081
MY FAULT ?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.549
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHO'S FAULT IT IS.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.786
THING IS, WHAT'RE
WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT ?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.390
I GOT A PLAN...

11:30.490 --> 11:35.028
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY
TO TAKE THAT STEP THOUGH...

11:35.128 --> 11:38.832
WHERE ARE YOU ?

11:38.932 --> 11:42.836

11:42.936 --> 11:47.207

GONNA SEE HIM BUT ONCE.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.751
YOU SAID IT
TO MY FACE.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.452
AT LEAST I DIDN'T
BRING HIM INTO THE TENT

11:59.552 --> 12:02.289
AND PUT HIM

12:07.160 --> 12:10.764

12:18.872 --> 12:21.541

12:44.865 --> 12:46.666

12:46.766 --> 12:50.203

12:54.808 --> 12:57.310

20:46.212 --> 20:48.648
DEAL ?

20:55.054 --> 20:58.358
I'M REMINDED OF THE PHRASE,
MAKING A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.395
COME ON, NOW,
I'M NOT THAT BAD.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.230
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.833
( laughing )

21:15.041 --> 21:17.544
MIGHTY STRANGE RUTHIE HASN'T
BEEN OUT OF HER TRAILER YET.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.946
YOU THINK
SHE'S ALRIGHT ?

21:20.046 --> 21:23.316
YOU SHOULDN'T CONCERN
YOURSELF WITH HER, MY DEAR.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.452
( music playing )

21:25.552 --> 21:28.421
WELL, MAYBE I'LL GO GIVE HER
A SHOUT AND MAKE SURE SHE'S--

21:28.521 --> 21:31.924
I SAID, DO NOT
CONCERN YOURSELF.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.028
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
YOU OLD FRAUD.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.264
LILA...

21:38.365 --> 21:41.868
CONSIDER THE FATE OF
CATS AND CURIOSITY.

21:49.676 --> 21:53.012
* ... I WANT YOU--
I WANT YOU-- *

21:53.112 --> 21:55.682
* I WANT YOU--
I WANT YOU... *

21:55.782 --> 21:58.885
APOLLONIA...

22:13.600 --> 22:15.902
HE AIN'T
REALLY LEAVING.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.572
HE'S JUST
PUTTING ON A SHOW.

22:19.672 --> 22:24.143
MAKING A BIG POINT AT POKING
INSIDE ALL THE TENTS,

22:24.243 --> 22:26.112
ASKING QUESTIONS.

22:26.212 --> 22:30.016
NOW HE'S LETTING US GET A GOOD
LOOK AT HIM CLIMB IN HIS CAR

22:30.116 --> 22:32.885
AND DRIVIN' OFF.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.390
WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM ?

22:37.490 --> 22:39.692
I TOLD HIM YOU
WAS IN BABYLON,

22:39.792 --> 22:43.996
BUT HE KNOWS YOU'RE
HERE SOMEPLACE.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.073
YEP.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.548
TALK TO THE MAN ?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.817
YEAH.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.454
WHAT'D HE SAY ?

23:07.554 --> 23:13.059
SAID HE GOT
SOME ANSWERS FOR ME.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.764
SAID HIM AND ME...

23:21.200 --> 23:23.069
WE'RE ALIKE.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.806
IS THAT A FACT ?

23:32.311 --> 23:34.814
HE SAY
ANYTHING ELSE ?

23:34.914 --> 23:40.453
TOLD ME HOW
I COULD HELP SOMEONE.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.724
BUT THERE'S A PRICE.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.462
AND WHO'S GONNA
PAY THAT PRICE ?

23:51.063 --> 23:54.200
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
YOU GOTTA DO AND I DON'T CARE.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.803
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT KIND
OF GAMES MANAGEMENT PLAYS.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.572
HE DON'T CARE
MUCH FOR PEOPLE.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.475
LIKE PIECES MOVING
AROUND ON A BOARD.

24:02.575 --> 24:05.645
BUT THESE PEOPLE AROUND HERE
MEAN MORE THAN THAT TO ME.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.280
WHATEVER IT IS YOU GOT
TO DO YOU MAKE SURE

24:08.380 --> 24:10.316
IT HAPPENS
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.484
SOMEBODY DON'T MATTER.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.319
SOMEONE WHO
WON'T BE MISSED.

24:13.419 --> 24:16.823
SOMEONE MORE LIKE YOU.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.498
THERE AIN'T NOTHING GOOD
HAPPENED SINCE YOU COME HERE.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.433
NOT FOR US.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.870
NOT FOR YOU.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.577
APOLLONIA.

24:37.677 --> 24:42.214
APOLLONIA, MY DEAR.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.392
SO WHAT IS IT
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME ?

24:53.492 --> 24:57.997
( music playing )

25:31.731 --> 25:33.600
HOW LONG

25:33.700 --> 25:35.367

CATALINA'S ACT NOW ?

25:35.467 --> 25:37.536
NAH, I JUST LIKE
HER MUSIC.

25:37.637 --> 25:40.472
THOUGHT WE MIGHT
PARTNER UP FOR A NUMBER.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.341
YOU LIKE HER ?

25:42.441 --> 25:44.777
SHE'S OKAY.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.546
YEAH, I KINDA
LIKE HER.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.415
MORE THAN ME ?

25:49.515 --> 25:52.484

25:52.585 --> 25:54.621

25:56.422 --> 25:59.859
WANT TO MAKE SURE I STILL HAVE
MY DRINKING PARTNER IS ALL.

25:59.959 --> 26:03.262
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GONNA GO NEAR THE WORM AGAIN.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.597
WELL, I WASN'T.

26:04.697 --> 26:08.735
BUT I JUST KEEP
THINKING 'BOUT IT.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.574
TRUTH IS...

26:15.675 --> 26:20.980
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.190

26:40.499 --> 26:41.768

26:41.868 --> 26:45.104
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

26:45.204 --> 26:48.975
IN THE WHOLE WORLD
THAT I CAN TRUST.

26:49.075 --> 26:53.479
AND I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD
ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR ME

26:53.579 --> 26:56.382
AND PROTECT ME.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.952
AND MAKE SURE
NO ONE EVER HURT ME.

27:00.052 --> 27:03.489
I WOULD.

27:03.589 --> 27:07.960
ABSOLUTELY,
IF I COULD.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.966
I SHOULD GO.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.636
'KAY.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.310
DO YOU WANT TO GET
TOGETHER LATER ?

27:24.410 --> 27:25.577
AFTER WE SHUT DOWN ?

27:25.678 --> 27:27.313
SOMEPLACE QUIET ?

27:27.413 --> 27:30.082
PRIVATE ?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.987
YEAH.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.100
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN ?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.269
IT CAN'T BE HER.

27:50.369 --> 27:54.306
THIS IS MADNESS.

27:54.406 --> 27:57.376
YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

28:03.716 --> 28:06.719
MADNESS !

28:09.555 --> 28:13.025
( loud rumbling noise )

28:21.868 --> 28:25.938
( chattering )

29:01.540 --> 29:05.845
( coughing )

29:12.718 --> 29:15.287
WHO IS THAT ?

29:15.387 --> 29:16.322
HIM ?

29:16.422 --> 29:17.523
HE'S NO ONE.

29:17.623 --> 29:20.827
LEFT OVER TRASH
FROM THE FIESTA.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.813
ESTA BIEN.

29:46.452 --> 29:52.058
( coughing )

29:55.527 --> 29:57.296
ESTA BIEN...

29:57.396 --> 30:00.900
( Spanish )

32:18.104 --> 32:20.272
HELLO, NORMAN.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.774
JUSTIN !

32:22.874 --> 32:26.745
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU COME IN.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.414
YOU'RE WELL ?

32:28.514 --> 32:30.816
I'M FINE.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.884
HOW ARE YOU ?

32:32.985 --> 32:36.622
I'M A CHANGED MAN.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.658
I CAN SEE THAT.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.660
AND THAT CONCERNS YOU.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.163
YES, IT DOES.

32:44.263 --> 32:47.766
I CAN'T SAY
I BLAME YOU.

32:47.866 --> 32:50.269
FROM YOUR POSITION,

32:50.369 --> 32:54.806
I'M SURE IT MUST LOOK AS
IF I'VE GONE MAD OR WORSE.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.643
MAY I ?

33:07.419 --> 33:09.155
NORMAN...

33:09.255 --> 33:12.124
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE BECOME A PAPIST.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.793
DOING SOME RESEARCH.

33:14.893 --> 33:17.696
REALLY,
ON WHAT SUBJECT ?

33:17.796 --> 33:20.332
THE SEDUCTIVE
NATURE OF EVIL.

33:20.432 --> 33:24.170
FASCINATING.

33:25.937 --> 33:29.608
OH, I HAVE
SO MUCH TO DO.

33:29.708 --> 33:34.646
MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.018
IRIS TOLD ME.

33:40.119 --> 33:43.822
BAPTISMAL WATER
TRANSFORMING INTO BLOOD.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.891
REALLY, NORMAN--

33:45.991 --> 33:47.126
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

33:47.226 --> 33:50.529
IT'S A SHAME
NO ONE ELSE DID.

33:50.629 --> 33:54.600
JUSTIN, PLEASE.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.937
YOU MUST TURN AWAY FROM ALL
THIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

33:59.037 --> 34:04.042
TURN AWAY FROM WHAT ?

34:05.811 --> 34:07.579
SAY IT.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.048
JUSTIN...

34:10.149 --> 34:12.584
THERE IS A DEMON
WITHIN YOU.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.920
LET ME HELP YOU.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.189
THERE IS NO DEMON
WITHIN ME.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.492
BUT THERE IS ONE
WITHIN YOU, NORMAN.

34:20.592 --> 34:25.631
ALL MEN HAVE SINNED AGAINST GOD
AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIVES.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.066
EVEN YOU, NORMAN.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.102
LET ME GO.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.180
( horse neighing )

35:18.384 --> 35:19.751
THIS DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE...

35:19.851 --> 35:20.719
NO ?

35:20.819 --> 35:21.987
I'M SURE IT WILL.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.256
IT ALWAYS DOES.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.065
CHILDREN...

35:34.166 --> 35:38.304
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

35:41.340 --> 35:43.842
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE ?

35:45.844 --> 35:47.613
ARE YOU
A MAN OF GOD ?

35:47.713 --> 35:49.681
YES, MY CHILD.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.317
I'M A MINISTER.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.131
SHHH, THERE, THERE,

36:06.232 --> 36:09.601
IT'S ALRIGHT, SON.

36:09.701 --> 36:13.839
I PROMISE I WON'T LET
ANY HARM COME TO YOU.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.216
MY GREATEST EVIL.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.585
SAVING YOUR LIFE ?

36:26.685 --> 36:28.987
GIVING YOU REFUGE ?

36:29.087 --> 36:31.857
PROTECTING
AND NURTURING YOU...

36:31.957 --> 36:34.660
NO, NO, THIS CAN'T BE.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.163
BY YOUR OWN WORDS,
THE SIN I MUST EMBRACE,

36:38.264 --> 36:40.899
THE EVIL THAT I BROUGHT
INTO THE WORLD...

36:40.999 --> 36:43.769
IS ME !

36:47.539 --> 36:49.207
IT'S NOT
TOO LATE, SON.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.742
PRAY WITH ME NOW.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.045
BEG THE LORD GOD
TO HAVE PITY UPON YOU.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.314
NO !

36:55.414 --> 36:56.882
PRAY, PRAY WITH ME.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.984
PRAY THAT
THE DEMON LEAVE YOU.

36:59.084 --> 37:02.388
THERE IS
NO DEMON IN ME.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.524
THE DEMON IS ME.

37:19.505 --> 37:22.941
DO THE THING
YOU MUST DO.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.520
PLEASE, NORMAN.

37:34.620 --> 37:38.590
NOW, BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE !

37:41.993 --> 37:45.831
IF YOU'VE
EVER LOVED ME.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.493
THOU ANOINTEST
MY HEAD WITH OIL;

38:14.593 --> 38:20.298
MY CUP RUNNETH OVER...

38:26.938 --> 38:30.275
SHALL FOLLOW ME,

38:30.376 --> 38:33.712
ALL THE DAYS

38:42.721 --> 38:45.924
NORMAN !

38:54.032 --> 38:57.536
( voice of management )
HER LIFE FOR ANOTHER'S.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.672
IT IS THE ONLY WAY.

39:26.297 --> 39:29.401
IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY.

39:31.903 --> 39:35.607
YOU'RE MEANT
FOR GREATER THINGS.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.144
THIS IS WHO YOU ARE.

40:10.876 --> 40:14.145
YOU MUST
MAKE YOUR CHOICE.

40:15.481 --> 40:18.016
I'M SORRY.

41:19.545 --> 41:22.213
PEOPLE ARE
ALREADY GATHERING.

41:30.121 --> 41:34.192
THE BIBLE TELLS US
WE ARE ALL BORN IN SIN.

41:34.292 --> 41:39.264
EACH OF US DAMNED
AT BIRTH.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.803
THE BIBLE
ALSO TELLS US

41:44.903 --> 41:48.807
THAT REDEMPTION
IS POSSIBLE.

41:48.907 --> 41:55.080
WE CAN ALL BE REBORN AGAIN,
WITH GOD'S LOVE.

42:03.622 --> 42:07.258
PERHAPS GOD HAS OTHER
PLANS FOR SOME OF US.

42:20.706 --> 42:22.708
THE HOUR GROWS LATE.

42:22.808 --> 42:25.410
THE BOY WILL RETURN.

42:25.510 --> 42:29.347
YOU'VE DONE WELL,
MY FRIEND.

42:29.447 --> 42:31.449
AT YOUR SERVICE.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.052
AS ALWAYS, MY PRINCE.

42:34.152 --> 42:38.123
SUCH LOYAL SERVICE
SHOULD BE REWARDED.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.692
COME CLOSER.

42:40.792 --> 42:44.730
I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.200

43:24.770 --> 43:26.171
I'M JUST GONNA SPEND
SOME TIME WITH A FRIEND.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.639
A FRIEND ?

43:27.739 --> 43:31.242
YEAH, MAMA,
A FRIEND.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.996

43:57.736 --> 43:59.404
LOOKING FOR ME ?

43:59.504 --> 44:03.108

44:10.215 --> 44:11.917
SMOKE ?

44:12.017 --> 44:14.319
SURE.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.289
DON'T HAVE
A LIGHT, SO.

44:26.832 --> 44:28.499
HOW'D YOU DO TONIGHT ?

44:28.599 --> 44:32.237
SAME AS USUAL.

YEAH...

45:24.923 --> 45:28.326
WHATCHA DOING

45:43.708 --> 45:48.413
THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE
BETRAYED BY SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

45:52.483 --> 45:54.452
YOU FUCKED RITA SUE

45:54.552 --> 45:57.856
AND YOU KNEW.

47:31.482 --> 47:33.851
I'M SORRY.

48:05.616 --> 48:09.587
( fingers snapping )

48:21.299 --> 48:23.301
THE CLOCK IS TICKING,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS...

48:23.401 --> 48:27.472
COUNTING DOWN
TO ARMAGEDDON...

48:37.582 --> 48:41.686
( whispering )
SOFIE...

48:51.896 --> 48:54.065
THE WORM REVEALS HIMSELF

48:54.165 --> 48:56.534
IN MANY GUISES ACROSS
THIS ONCE GREAT LAND.

48:56.634 --> 49:00.972
FROM THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE

OUR CHILDREN WITH THE SAVAGE
BLASPHEMY OF DARWIN,

49:04.375 --> 49:08.746
TO THE CRAVEN HOLLYWOOD PAGANS
CORRUPTING THEM IN THE DARKNESS

49:08.846 --> 49:10.548
OF THE LOCAL BIJOU.

49:10.648 --> 49:12.783
FROM THE FALSE PROPHETS,

49:12.883 --> 49:14.585
COWERING BEHIND
OUR NATION'S PULPITS,

49:14.685 --> 49:18.423
TO THE VILE PARASITES
IN OUR BANKS AND BOARDROOMS,

49:18.523 --> 49:21.859
AND THE GODLESS POLITICIANS
GROWING FAT ON THE MISERY

49:21.959 --> 49:24.195
OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS.

49:24.295 --> 49:27.398
THE SIGNS OF THE END
TIMES ARE ALL AROUND US.

49:27.498 --> 49:31.769
ETCHED IN BLOOD AND FIRE
BY THE LEFT HAND OF GOD.

49:31.869 --> 49:34.805
YOU HAVE BUT TO OPEN YOUR EYES,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

49:34.905 --> 49:39.444
THE TRUTH IS THAT
THE DEVIL IS HERE.

49:45.650 --> 49:48.319
WHAT ARE YOU DOING !

49:50.088 --> 49:51.922
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

49:52.023 --> 49:54.625
LET GO OF ME !

49:57.295 --> 50:00.198
THE ANTICHRIST,
THE CHILD OF LIES,

50:00.298 --> 50:03.768
THE SON OF DARKNESS
WALKS AMONG US

50:03.868 --> 50:05.936
CLOAKED IN THE FLESH
OF A MAN.

50:06.037 --> 50:11.109
DOES THE LORD NOT WEEP
AT THIS DEGRADATION ?

50:11.209 --> 50:14.445
DOES HE NOT TREMBLE
WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY ?

50:14.545 --> 50:19.584
AND SHALL HE NOT
SEEK RETRIBUTION ?

50:33.898 --> 50:35.100
YOU'RE WRONG.

50:35.200 --> 50:38.269
I AIN'T LIKE YOU.

50:38.369 --> 50:41.106
I AIN'T
ONE OF YOUR KIND.

50:41.206 --> 50:42.740
AND I CAN'T DO IT.

50:42.840 --> 50:47.011
GOD TAKES WHAT'S HIS,
MAN DON'T TAKE IT BACK.

50:47.112 --> 50:50.148
THAT IS WHERE
YOU ARE WRONG.

50:50.248 --> 50:55.453
YOU SEE, GOD HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH RUTHIE'S FATE.

50:55.553 --> 51:01.058
IT WAS PROFESSOR LODZ
WHO MURDERED YOUR FRIEND.

51:02.393 --> 51:05.029
WHY ARE YOU
SAYING THIS ?

51:05.130 --> 51:07.765
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

51:07.865 --> 51:10.901
THE MAN'S JOKING, BEN.

51:11.001 --> 51:12.903
YOU DON'T
BELIEVE HIM.

51:13.003 --> 51:16.374
LOOK HIM
IN THE EYES.

51:21.512 --> 51:25.583
HAWKINS, HE'S LYING,
TRUST ME !

51:39.697 --> 51:42.533
( Brother Justin )
I OPEN MY EYES
AND I SEE A BLOOD SKY.

51:42.633 --> 51:46.737
THAT TEARS APART AND SCREAMS
WITH A VOICE THAT IS THUNDER.

51:46.837 --> 51:48.439
RISE UP.

51:48.539 --> 51:53.344
RISE UP, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
AND TAKE YOUR PLACE AT MY SIDE.

51:56.046 --> 51:57.448
SHE IN THERE ?

51:57.548 --> 52:01.219
SOFIE !

52:08.893 --> 52:11.596
JONESY, JONESY, NO !

52:14.199 --> 52:16.267
FOR YOU SHALL
BE MY SIDE

52:16.367 --> 52:20.305
AND YOUR FATE SHALL SHINE
LIKE A THOUSAND SUNS.

52:20.405 --> 52:23.308
AND THE STREETS
SHALL BE SANCTIFIED

52:23.408 --> 52:26.177
WITH THE STEAMING BLACK
BLOOD OF THE HERETICS.

52:26.277 --> 52:29.347
YOU TAKE A GOOD LOOK,
YOU SUMBITCH.

52:29.447 --> 52:33.484
YOU TAKE
A GOOD LOOK.

52:58.776 --> 53:03.814
IT APPEARS WE ARE OF
LIKE NATURE AFTER ALL.

53:03.914 --> 53:07.485
( heavy breathing )

53:12.423 --> 53:14.692
AND TOGETHER,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

53:14.792 --> 53:18.996
TOGETHER WE SHALL
BUILD A SHINING TEMPLE,

53:19.096 --> 53:23.368
A KINGDOM THAT
WILL LAST FOR THOUSANDS

53:23.468 --> 53:26.504
AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

53:42.853 --> 53:46.357
( gasping )
