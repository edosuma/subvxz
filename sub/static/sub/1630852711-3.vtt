WEBVTT

00:37.375 --> 00:38.500
Is she with the police?

00:38.583 --> 00:41.250
Don't tell me you didn't know.
She's the police chief.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.000
I wonder what he's gonna do.

00:52.666 --> 00:56.291
Guys, I'm really sorry, but I have to go.
There was a murder on Dante Street.

00:59.541 --> 01:01.041
Isn't it a bit late?

01:01.125 --> 01:02.875
Ah, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:02.958 --> 01:04.250
It fell out.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.708
Oh my God.

01:07.791 --> 01:09.625
Guys, I heard everything.

01:09.708 --> 01:12.583
So apparently, a man
with links to the Mafia has been killed.

01:12.666 --> 01:14.083
Some guy named Alberto Gambino.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.875
- I'm going to work. Yay, Mafia!

01:17.791 --> 01:19.541
- Ester!
- She fell down.

01:19.625 --> 01:20.916
- What?
- Ester?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.958
- Mm, deserved it.
- Ester!

01:23.458 --> 01:25.875
Get a doctor. She's fainted! Ester?

01:25.958 --> 01:27.458
Let's go, Chief.

01:27.541 --> 01:30.500
We can't waste time on people
who faint at the word "murder."

01:30.583 --> 01:32.541
She's lacking in her sugar.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.916
Excuse me, Chief!

01:35.000 --> 01:39.583
Excuse me. Do you think that this murder
could finally start a new Mafia war?

01:41.625 --> 01:44.000
Ester? Ester,
can you hear me? Ester?

01:44.083 --> 01:45.708
A murder?

01:45.791 --> 01:46.833
That's serious.

01:47.750 --> 01:48.833
Ah.

01:48.916 --> 01:50.333
Giuseppe, write this.

01:50.416 --> 01:51.916
"A murder mystery

01:52.000 --> 01:55.541
and a Sicily as enigmatic
as it is self-evident."

01:56.166 --> 01:58.375
"For the time being, we are…

02:00.833 --> 02:03.541
like a woman pregnant with a child."

02:03.625 --> 02:05.500
"We must be ready for anything."

02:05.583 --> 02:07.958
"With the sweetness of creation

02:08.041 --> 02:10.291
and the pain of birthing a child."

02:10.791 --> 02:11.625
Hmm.

02:35.583 --> 02:38.666
It was only a matter of time,
my friend gardener.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.291
Your touch,

02:40.375 --> 02:43.333
<i>it wasn't enough</i>
<i>to keep you out of jail this time.</i>

02:43.416 --> 02:46.375
<i>Yours was just luck.</i>

02:53.166 --> 02:55.708
Hey, Salvo. Salvo, there's a problem.

02:55.791 --> 02:59.500
I know. Ester doesn't love me anymore,
and that's why she was cheating.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.708
No, there's a different problem now.

03:03.333 --> 03:07.250
It's quiet at my house.
Outside, it's silent. That's unheard of.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.458
It is completely silent
in the apartment over here too.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.416
Ester's in the other room,
mourning the death of her lover.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.416
Salvo, I'm worried that the Mafia
found out yesterday

03:17.500 --> 03:19.958
we were over at Mr. Gambino's apartment,

03:20.041 --> 03:21.625
and now they want us dead.

03:22.666 --> 03:24.625
If the Mafia kills us,

03:24.708 --> 03:28.166
do you think Ester will cry for me
the way she did for her lover?

03:30.125 --> 03:31.083
Salvo, come on.

03:31.166 --> 03:34.041
Get some rest, and we'll talk about this
tomorrow morning, okay?

03:34.125 --> 03:37.583
But will you tell me,
"Goodnight, tortellini"?

03:37.666 --> 03:39.083
<i>Yeah, okay. Bye.</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:40.583
Bye.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.666
<i>Seems like the case is closed,</i>
<i>Inspector Jackson.</i>

03:47.750 --> 03:49.083
<i>I don't believe so.</i>

03:49.166 --> 03:52.291
<i>Our gardener here</i>
<i>can't have done it all by himself.</i>

03:52.375 --> 03:55.541
<i>There's someone</i>
<i>that has a thing or two to confess.</i>

03:55.625 --> 03:57.250
Talk to me.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.291
Talk. I need to know what's going on.

04:00.375 --> 04:03.750
Would you calm down?
It's just a dizzy spell. It's fine.

04:05.708 --> 04:09.666
You forget that a mother always knows
when her daughter is lying to her. So?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.875
Mom, don't start
with all this teacher stuff.

04:11.958 --> 04:14.791
I'm not a student,
and I'm not at school, okay?

04:14.875 --> 04:18.375
Don't think I didn't see how that husband
of yours was treating you at the party.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.875
Everyone saw it.

04:19.958 --> 04:22.458
But it's nothing new for him.

04:22.541 --> 04:25.541
He's always been so stupid. Vulgar.

04:25.625 --> 04:26.583
Useless.

04:27.083 --> 04:30.041
I've always said so. You should have a--

04:30.125 --> 04:31.500
Better husband.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.083
- You always repeat things. Just quit it.
- Oh, yes?

04:34.166 --> 04:36.750
Well, all right.
I'll tell you something new then.

04:36.833 --> 04:37.666
Okay, let's hear it.

04:37.750 --> 04:41.583
I think that your husband out there
has a lover.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.208
No, Mom. He hasn't got a lover.

04:44.291 --> 04:47.750
They always do. The husband
has a lover and treats his wife poorly.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.041
- He hasn't got a lover.
- He's got a lover.

04:50.125 --> 04:52.500
- He doesn't have a lover.
- He's got a lover.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.666
No, he doesn't have one!

04:53.750 --> 04:56.250
Actually, if you really want to know,
I'm the one with the lover.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.166
Are you sure?

05:01.500 --> 05:05.000
What are you saying, am I sure?
You think I'm confused about that?

05:05.083 --> 05:06.583
Of course I would know that.

05:11.958 --> 05:14.541
- Have you fallen in love too?
- Of course I haven't.

05:14.625 --> 05:15.916
So what did you do that for?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.708
I don't know. I don't know.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.458
I just don't know if I love him anymore.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.291
I understand.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.291
And so who did you cheat with then?

05:29.375 --> 05:30.500
Anyone I know?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.333
No, you don't know him.

05:35.625 --> 05:38.083
Or rather, you didn't know him.

05:39.541 --> 05:41.875
Oh, well then, it's finished?

05:44.916 --> 05:46.458
Does he know that?

05:49.708 --> 05:53.125
He's got some idea
because he's done a thing that's very bad.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.833
Of course it's very bad!

05:54.916 --> 05:56.500
You never hit a woman!

05:56.583 --> 05:58.791
I don't care if you're cheating
with the whole world.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.500
Nobody was hit, okay?

06:00.583 --> 06:02.416
And how did you get this cute thing?

06:02.500 --> 06:06.333
Are you deaf? I got it when I was working
around the house doing the chores.

06:09.416 --> 06:10.291
Anyway,

06:10.958 --> 06:12.333
I'll stay with you tonight.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.375
I won't leave you with that monster.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.416
Mom, please listen.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.208
Salvo did not hit me. It was an accident.
Trust me for once in your life.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.458
- All right, that's fine. I'll go home.
- Hmm.

06:22.541 --> 06:24.833
But I will be leaving my phone on.

06:24.916 --> 06:29.916
If that man tries to do anything at all,
call Mommy. All right?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.166
I'm going. Goodbye, my love.

06:35.416 --> 06:36.250
See you.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.166
<i>What are you trying to say, Inspector?</i>

06:38.250 --> 06:40.708
<i>You were my best friend, Sam.</i>

06:41.750 --> 06:44.666
<i>But you were also</i>
<i>the mastermind behind the killer.</i>

06:49.666 --> 06:52.625
<i>You were so good</i>
<i>at pretending you didn't know.</i>

06:53.250 --> 06:54.375
I'm going now.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.166
Oh, I almost forgot.

06:59.291 --> 07:03.208
I'm so worried about that bruise
that appeared on Ester's forehead.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.958
She said it showed up out of nowhere.

07:06.458 --> 07:09.041
Well, things on your forehead
don't just suddenly appear.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.333
Exactly.

07:10.416 --> 07:12.541
I'm taking her to the doctor tomorrow.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.541
I guess we'll see
if she gets any more bruises tonight.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.250
- We'll see.
- Mm.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.000
Have a good night.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.000
Good night.

07:20.625 --> 07:26.250
Oh, and I also mentioned to Ester
that I'll be leaving my phone on,

07:26.333 --> 07:30.041
so, you see, if anything goes on,
she should call then.

07:30.125 --> 07:34.916
If any little thing happens tonight,
I'll be here immediately.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.291
Bye again, Salvo.

07:37.375 --> 07:38.458
Goodbye again.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.791
<i>It seems the case is closed, Inspector.</i>

07:42.875 --> 07:43.958
<i>No, Sam.</i>

07:44.041 --> 07:48.083
<i>There's one more person</i>
<i>that has some things to explain to us.</i>

08:02.083 --> 08:03.625
Did they capture the assassin?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.208
Since when are you interested in my show?

08:07.291 --> 08:08.625
What's different?

08:08.708 --> 08:09.583
Bah.

08:12.416 --> 08:14.458
I was wondering
if there are any other victims.

08:14.541 --> 08:16.666
Don't you worry about the other victims.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.583
Many of them deserve to be killed. Hmm.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.000
What are you saying, Salvo?

08:23.708 --> 08:24.708
Please just tell me.

08:25.333 --> 08:29.416
If you're being an asshole, someone
is eventually gonna show up and kill you.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.625
They deserved it.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.833
<i>Well, gardener, your wife was in it too.</i>

08:49.333 --> 08:53.250
<i>If she wasn't the notary's lover,</i>
<i>we never would've found out about her.</i>

08:53.333 --> 08:55.166
<i>Okay, take them all away.</i>

08:55.250 --> 08:58.291
<i>It seems like the case is closed,</i>
<i>Inspector Jackson.</i>

08:58.375 --> 08:59.500
<i>No, Sam.</i>

09:00.375 --> 09:03.958
<i>There's always someone out there</i>
<i>thinking about committing a crime.</i>

09:20.625 --> 09:21.875
Mama, where's the breakfast?

09:21.958 --> 09:24.083
Uh, there's yesterday's cake.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.208
With the ricotta?

09:25.291 --> 09:27.250
Valentino!

09:27.333 --> 09:30.666
- Do you know how worried I am about Ester?
- What are you worried about?

09:30.750 --> 09:32.708
You said it yourself.
It's low blood sugar.

09:32.791 --> 09:34.875
It's just because
of all of those fake things she eats.

09:34.958 --> 09:40.541
Valentino, there are some things
that I know… I mustn't say it.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.000
Things like what?

09:42.083 --> 09:43.833
Salvo's beating up your sister.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.375
Have you seen that bruise on her forehead?

09:46.458 --> 09:49.500
There is no way
Salvo would ever do that to anyone.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.833
I don't like any of this.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.541
Valentino, look out for Ester.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.500
She's your sister.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.625
And you look out for her too.
You're her mom.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.708
It might be too late for that now.

10:01.791 --> 10:04.083
It's going from bad to worse.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.583
Mama's saying strange things,
and I'm worried about Ester too.

10:06.666 --> 10:08.583
She might know something.
She's acting strange.

10:08.666 --> 10:11.250
She doesn't know anything.
She's mourning her tortellone.

10:11.333 --> 10:14.708
- And if the Mafia finds out we were there?
- What Mafia? Oh please.

10:14.791 --> 10:15.750
Hurry it up, okay?

10:15.833 --> 10:17.000
Put your foot down already.

10:17.083 --> 10:20.250
You know my friend at city hall
is waiting. The Mafia!

10:20.333 --> 10:22.625
I think that car right behind us
is following us, Salvo.

10:22.708 --> 10:24.000
What if it's from the Mafia?

10:24.083 --> 10:27.625
Oh, hey, just check and see if "Mafia"
is written on the car. Then you'll know.

10:32.916 --> 10:34.916
CITY HALL

10:37.750 --> 10:40.125
Anyway, this whole situation
is making me nervous.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.166
Uh-huh. Stop all this worrying. Come on.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.791
- Parking enforcement?
- At the end on the left.

10:44.875 --> 10:45.708
Thanks.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.916
The elevator's right there, huh?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
But it's only one floor, though.

10:54.083 --> 10:57.416
This thing about you refusing
to take elevators is a problem.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.541
- At least it gets you moving.
- Yeah, moving.

11:15.916 --> 11:19.125
So, Maurizio, do you think you'll be able
to take care of that ticket for us?

11:19.208 --> 11:21.416
Shh.

11:22.958 --> 11:24.375
Ah.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.041
Gotta be quiet.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.625
You gotta believe me.
We were there for less than two minutes.

11:31.708 --> 11:34.000
I feel that this ticket
was truly uncalled for.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.458
You think there's fair tickets, do you?

11:36.541 --> 11:37.375
- No.
- No.

11:37.458 --> 11:40.000
A ticket is just a political ploy
to get your money.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.416
That money is yours.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.750
- Right. Right.
- That's true.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.875
And it's our fault.
We voted for all of them.

11:45.458 --> 11:46.375
That's true.

11:46.458 --> 11:50.041
And so, it's truly your fault
because your vote went to this.

11:50.125 --> 11:51.750
- Right. Right.
- Exactly. True.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.791
- You know what he's saying…
- All right.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.166
So because this is fresh, we can do it.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.708
And this was from yesterday, huh?

11:57.791 --> 11:59.375
- Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes, yesterday.

11:59.458 --> 12:00.958
We only ever get new tickets.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.375
Well, consider the ticket eradicated.

12:03.458 --> 12:04.458
- Good.
- Oh, that's good.

12:04.541 --> 12:07.000
Now, go and see
this friend of mine.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.208
A manager, upstairs. Very high up.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.500
And I got him hired.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.833
You'll find him in the office upstairs

12:15.916 --> 12:18.083
at the Illegal Parking Office.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.041
Good.

12:19.125 --> 12:22.166
Obviously, you have to let him know
that it was I who was sending you.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.583
- Yeah.
- Yes, of course.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.500
Just never tell him my name, okay?

12:30.666 --> 12:31.500
What do you mean?

12:32.083 --> 12:34.916
Guys, don't you have to go
to my friend to get rid of this ticket?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.166
- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.916
And you have to say who sent you.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.291
- Ah.
- All right then.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.583
Say it without telling him
my name, though.

12:43.958 --> 12:45.125
Mm.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.500
And what should we say to him?

12:49.083 --> 12:50.333
Just don't tell him Maurizio.

12:50.416 --> 12:52.083
Why are you always…

12:52.166 --> 12:53.208
Just be quiet.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.666
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.500
Oh, and, uh, we don't…

13:01.750 --> 13:03.666
Oh, now we don't care. All right.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.000
Just one moment, and we'll get it for you.

13:08.750 --> 13:09.833
Okay.

13:13.416 --> 13:14.458
For the party, you know?

13:14.541 --> 13:15.833
- Yes.
- Of course. Yes.

13:15.916 --> 13:16.833
Yes.

13:19.125 --> 13:22.208
What is this? Why with the hands?
Why are you doing that? For what?

13:25.250 --> 13:28.208
These days things are getting
more and more difficult.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.458
There's eyes and ears all over.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.958
But since you were sent here
by our little friend…

13:35.458 --> 13:38.583
Still him, the person who we didn't name.

13:38.666 --> 13:40.916
- Yes, that's who.
- Oh, okay.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.250
I can't actually do much about it myself.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.666
For that, you need
to go to the next floor.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.375
Talk to my colleague. She's very good.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.625
I got her hired.

13:50.583 --> 13:53.916
You can find her
in the Property Maintenance Office.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.041
But I have to recommend
just don't tell her my name.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.666
Well, of course.

13:58.750 --> 14:04.333
For our unlucky colleagues, those of us
detained unfairly by the State.

14:13.666 --> 14:16.000
And then, you'll find another office.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.291
A friend of ours is there.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.791
I got him the job.

14:20.375 --> 14:21.750
The Records Office, you said?

14:22.333 --> 14:26.791
Yes, he's up on the next floor.
But no matter what, don't mention my name.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.083
Sure, you got it.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.250
For the orphanage.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.958
You need the Office of Residence.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.458
It's one floor up.

14:37.958 --> 14:40.166
She's my cousin. But…

14:40.250 --> 14:42.333
We don't tell 'em your name. I got it.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.166
For the Sacred Heart Church.

14:45.541 --> 14:46.708
Thanks.

14:56.708 --> 14:59.416
Go to the next floor,
find the School Transport Office,

14:59.500 --> 15:01.541
and then they'll tell you
the name of my friend.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.666
But just be sure
that you don't say my name.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.666
Well, let's hope the roof
doesn't have offices too.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.333
Good morning.

15:34.416 --> 15:35.416
Good morning.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.708
Where exactly did you get this ticket at?

15:39.791 --> 15:41.250
On Dante Alighieri Street.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.916
Don't mention names!

15:46.833 --> 15:48.250
Are you kidding me?

15:48.333 --> 15:52.250
You mean, we paid 500 euros
to get rid of a 29-euro ticket?

15:52.333 --> 15:53.833
I can't stand you any longer.

15:53.916 --> 15:56.875
Look at my ear. I swear you're making
this one bigger than the other. See?

15:56.958 --> 15:58.416
- Ah.
- These are today's prices.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.000
- Be thankful it's been taken care of.
- Oh, those are the prices?

16:01.083 --> 16:03.541
There's a reason
why people usually pay for their tickets

16:03.625 --> 16:05.125
instead of making them go away.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.166
- That's the reason?
- Of course that's why!

16:07.250 --> 16:08.416
- Oh.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
- What?
- It's an unknown caller.

16:10.583 --> 16:13.125
- And pick it up.
- It could be the Mafia.

16:13.208 --> 16:14.583
The Mafia's got your cell?

16:14.666 --> 16:17.041
"Hello, this is the Mafia.
Press one to die."

16:17.125 --> 16:18.250
Just pick it up!

16:19.791 --> 16:20.625
Hello?

16:20.708 --> 16:23.416
Hi, Valentino. It's Agata.
Is this a good time?

16:23.500 --> 16:24.583
Oh, Agata.

16:24.666 --> 16:27.041
Yes, this is a great time to talk.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.083
I may have asked Simona for your cell.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.375
I wanted to say sorry about last night.

16:32.791 --> 16:35.875
With the police raid
and all of that chaos,

16:35.958 --> 16:37.583
I ruined the evening.

16:37.666 --> 16:40.791
Well, if that's the case,
this morning was bad as well.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.208
How is Ester?

16:42.291 --> 16:45.666
<i>Fine. Ester's fine.</i>
<i>It was just a dizzy spell.</i>

16:45.750 --> 16:50.125
Anyway, I wanted to say
that I really enjoyed chatting yesterday.

16:51.833 --> 16:53.666
I enjoyed myself as well.

16:53.750 --> 16:57.041
Well, it was nice to see
all of the old classmates back together,

16:57.125 --> 16:58.458
not only you. Uh…

16:59.000 --> 17:00.125
And also you.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.041
Great.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.041
<i>I mean, I really enjoyed it.</i>

17:03.125 --> 17:05.708
Really, I meant
the right amount of enjoying.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.000
I enjoyed it a little.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.458
Well, it had been a really long time.

17:09.541 --> 17:11.125
Yeah, it's been forever.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.666
Or maybe the right amount of time
has passed.

17:13.750 --> 17:17.375
Vale, after all these years,
are you still trying to flirt with me?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.083
What have we done? Oh no!

17:24.166 --> 17:26.208
No! Help! Help! Help!

17:26.291 --> 17:27.625
Wait! No! Careful!

17:28.625 --> 17:31.583
- Come on! Go! Go!

17:31.666 --> 17:32.666
Vale?

17:34.625 --> 17:35.458
Vale?

17:36.041 --> 17:37.333
Hello?

17:40.333 --> 17:41.666
I scared him away.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.041
Come on.

17:59.791 --> 18:00.875
Let's pick up the pace.

18:00.958 --> 18:03.666
Our party can't wait
for the guests of honor to arrive.

18:07.791 --> 18:08.750
Hurry.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.833
What are you doing? Oh!

18:13.916 --> 18:16.750
What-- What are-- Ah! Oh.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.208
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

18:19.291 --> 18:21.916
So don't breathe, then. Get some practice.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.500
What could you want with us?
We're just two TV technicians. That's all.

18:26.083 --> 18:26.958
All right.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.125
Now tell us why you killed Gambino.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.666
Best to talk, or this ends badly.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.041
Shut up, Useless Thing.

18:34.958 --> 18:36.875
You don't ask the questions.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.708
Do you agree with me?

18:40.458 --> 18:45.000
Yes, of course,
you… know that.

18:45.083 --> 18:49.791
That… You know that… you're right.

18:49.875 --> 18:51.458
Why are you stuttering?

18:51.541 --> 18:53.958
We all know
that every time you start stuttering,

18:54.750 --> 18:56.500
it's because you're lying.

18:58.166 --> 19:00.250
And you know
you should never lie to friends.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.250
Am I right?

19:01.333 --> 19:05.625
You're right, Primo Sale.
I'm sorry. We-- We don't lie to friends.

19:05.708 --> 19:06.791
Hmm.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.875
But you still love me, don't you?

19:09.583 --> 19:15.500
Yes…
Of course I love you, bu…

19:15.583 --> 19:19.416
bu-- I love you… bu…

19:19.500 --> 19:21.791
Bah! Bah!

19:24.416 --> 19:26.708
Bah! Bah!

19:27.416 --> 19:29.083
A little sheep. Hmm.

19:29.750 --> 19:30.583
Buddy.

19:32.291 --> 19:33.375
So sorry.

19:33.958 --> 19:36.416
Sometimes the Useless Thing oversteps.

19:37.916 --> 19:40.791
Who sent you?
And why did you boys kill Gambino?

19:40.875 --> 19:41.916
We didn't kill a soul!

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
We don't even know
who this Gambino guy is.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.500
We never met. Do you know who Gambino is?

19:46.583 --> 19:48.166
- No.
- Uh-huh.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.750
So what were you two doin'
over by his apartment yesterday?

19:50.833 --> 19:51.916
Well, there's no way.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.916
No, yesterday we were in Castelmonte.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.958
- Yes.
- In Castelmonte.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.833
Yes, we haven't gotten any receipts,
but there is proof.

19:57.916 --> 20:00.000
No lie. What I'm saying is the truth.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.375
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.083
Is that them?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.125
Uh-huh.

20:10.833 --> 20:13.791
I told you, don't mention my name.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.208
Don't say a word.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.250
They have no evidence. Trust me.

20:30.041 --> 20:34.125
Why did you guys wanna get rid of a ticket
you got outside of Gambino's apartment?

20:34.208 --> 20:37.375
Because for us to pay money to the State,
well, that would be immoral.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.708
It's nothing like protection money,
which of course is very sacred.

20:40.791 --> 20:42.541
We had no idea we were going to park

20:42.625 --> 20:45.291
on the street in front
of the apartment of Mr. Gambino.

20:45.375 --> 20:48.708
Ah, so you didn't go inside to Gambino's?

20:48.791 --> 20:49.916
- No!
- No!

20:50.500 --> 20:52.583
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

20:58.916 --> 21:02.708
- Salvo, they'll kill us.
- Trust me. Don't say a word.

21:14.666 --> 21:17.041
- Do you recognize these two knuckleheads?
- I do.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.291
That's Mr. Gambino and his friend.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.958
But I can't be Gambino

21:21.041 --> 21:23.375
if everyone is saying
that Gambino's already six feet under.

21:23.458 --> 21:26.000
Don't worry about it.
I'll make sure you're dead soon too.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.791
Don't worry, I have a plan.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.333
It's all your fault.

21:34.416 --> 21:36.500
I'm saving you from jail.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.208
I'd rather be in jail than dead!

21:38.291 --> 21:40.208
- You're an idiot.
- No, you are!

21:43.791 --> 21:44.666
Please no!

21:45.291 --> 21:48.125
You're right. We were at Gambino's
apartment, but we didn't kill him.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.166
He was dead when we got there.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.041
What? You're telling them a lie.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.000
Mr. Gambino is right next to you.

21:56.083 --> 22:00.041
"Destroy all those
who will speak their lies,

22:00.125 --> 22:02.833
and God hates
all murderers and deceivers."

22:07.083 --> 22:08.916
Psalm 5:6.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.750
Quiet! Take them away now.

22:10.833 --> 22:15.416
Just listen to me! That's Mr. Gambino.
He's alive and well. He's right there!

22:15.500 --> 22:16.666
I gotta pee!

22:21.041 --> 22:23.375
<i>After the police</i>
<i>have made countless arrests</i>

22:23.458 --> 22:25.250
<i>forcing the Mafia into a corner,</i>

22:25.333 --> 22:29.416
<i>today we go back to the murder</i>
<i>of a man with ties to the Mob.</i>

22:30.125 --> 22:33.333
<i>Is this the beginning</i>
<i>of a new Mafia war brewing?</i>

22:33.416 --> 22:36.083
<i>We'll see.</i>
<i>The investigators are considering…</i>

22:38.125 --> 22:41.541
<i>The dynamics of the Gambino murder</i>
<i>are unclear.</i>

22:41.625 --> 22:43.500
<i>Will there be any more deaths?</i>

22:43.583 --> 22:44.500
<i>We'll find out.</i>

22:44.583 --> 22:48.791
<i>What is certain is</i>
<i>this silence doesn't bode well for anyone.</i>

22:50.083 --> 22:52.416
Holy Father,
they admitted they were there.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.583
But they won't tell us who sent them
and why they killed him.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.833
Holy Father, I've had enough.
What do you want us to do with these two?

23:10.958 --> 23:13.583
The Holy Father says
that the pasta is ready.

23:15.708 --> 23:17.083
If we don't eat, it'll get cold.

23:17.833 --> 23:19.583
It would be our pleasure, Holy Father.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.458
Wait. Please!
Why-- Why do you want to do this to us?

23:22.541 --> 23:24.916
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

23:28.916 --> 23:32.666
<i>And like a storm with black clouds</i>
<i>hanging dark in the sky,</i>

23:32.750 --> 23:35.333
<i>we must deal</i>
<i>with the sweetness of creation</i> ,

23:35.416 --> 23:38.416
<i>the chaos, and many deaths</i>
<i>that weather can bring.</i>
