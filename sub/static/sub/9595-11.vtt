Now, you watch
your tone.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.603
I'm still
your father, son.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.472
Yeah, and I'm
<i>their</i> father, pops.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.774
I don't want my children going
through what I went through

17:56.776 --> 17:58.376
Over and over,

17:58.378 --> 18:00.244
Thinking you two
were getting back together

18:00.246 --> 18:01.646
Only to have
my heart broken.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.247
And then
to testify in court

18:03.249 --> 18:06.584
About my mama's secret stash
of boat dynamite.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.119
Not happening!

18:08.121 --> 18:10.655
No, no, let me
tell<i> you</i> something.

18:10.657 --> 18:14.592
End it now
or leave my damn house.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.868
I need something
out of my trunk.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.872
Hey, you gonna let little andre
punk you like that?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.373
'course he is.

18:29.375 --> 18:33.444
Old soft man can't even stand up
to his own son.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.680
Wash your own
damn shirt!

18:37.850 --> 18:38.749
And you.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.551
Me? What?

18:40.553 --> 18:43.287
Get a mirror.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.757
Welcome back, real ruby!

18:46.759 --> 18:48.693
[ notorious b.I.G.'s
"big poppa" playing ]
babe.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.729
Look, babe,
I know I was harsh, but --

18:51.731 --> 18:52.897
You were<i> incredible.</i>

18:52.899 --> 18:54.265
I was?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.766
Yes!

18:55.768 --> 18:58.669
Standing up to pops like that,
looking out for our kids.

18:58.671 --> 18:59.804
Ooh!

18:59.806 --> 19:01.305
Oh, you liked that, huh?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.707
Oh, I liked that.
I liked that.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.175
Oh, yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to him

19:04.177 --> 19:06.310
About some other things --
paying rent,

19:06.312 --> 19:08.913
Parking his car too far
to the left on the drive...

19:08.915 --> 19:11.616
[ inhales sharply ] ohh!
...Mowing the lawn
every Sunday.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.751
You gonna talk to him
about his drinking?

19:13.753 --> 19:14.819
No, I'm not gonna talk
to him about that.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.820
No.
Mnh-mnh.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.888
Don't do that.
No.

19:16.890 --> 19:17.788
Baby.
Hmm?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.357
Want to go upstairs?

19:19.359 --> 19:20.825
We better hurry
before pops comes back.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.727
You know, he could be
grabbing a tire iron

19:22.729 --> 19:23.928
Or grabbing a ham --
I never know.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.430
Let's go, baby. Come on!
[ laughing ] okay!

19:26.432 --> 19:29.800
<i>Law of attraction works</i>

19:29.802 --> 19:32.870
<i>I didn't need to be the caveman</i>
<i>I was 20 years ago.</i>

19:32.872 --> 19:34.839
<i>I'm a cave</i> dad<i> now.</i>

19:34.841 --> 19:37.608
[ car alarm chirps,
tires screech ]

19:40.345 --> 19:42.313
Here's to my love.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.314
[ chair squeaking ]

19:43.316 --> 19:46.184
Oh, true apothecary [gasps]

19:46.186 --> 19:47.852
Thy drugs are quick.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.453
[ shudders ]

19:49.455 --> 19:52.890
Thus, with a kiss...I die.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.860
Can't you see other people
trying to enjoy the show?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.229
Can't you see
all those other seats

19:58.231 --> 19:59.797
You could be sitting in?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.967
When are you just gonna
stop waking up in the morning?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.436
Question I asked myself
every day

20:05.438 --> 20:06.904
When I was married to you.

20:06.906 --> 20:10.841
<i>Hearing them snipe like this</i>
<i>was music to my ears.</i>

20:10.843 --> 20:13.344
<i>The love affair was over --</i>
<i>for now.</i>

20:13.346 --> 20:15.846
<i>Jack and diane seemed</i>
<i>no worse for wear,</i>

20:15.848 --> 20:18.683
<i>And there was only</i>
<i>a small fire.</i>

20:18.685 --> 20:20.885
[ laughs maniacally ]

20:20.887 --> 20:22.253
Whoo!

20:24.790 --> 20:25.890
Hey, baby.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.258
Hey.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.826
Who's your understudy?

20:28.828 --> 20:30.294
Wait for it.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.797
Yea, noise?

20:32.799 --> 20:34.966
Then I'll be brief.

20:34.968 --> 20:39.804
O happy dagger,
this is thy sheath.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.838
[ groans ]

20:40.840 --> 20:42.974
There rust...

20:42.976 --> 20:46.344
And let me...Die.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.783
Oh, my god!
Yeah!

20:52.785 --> 20:54.952
That was incredible!

20:54.954 --> 20:56.454
Junior!

20:56.456 --> 20:59.857
Oh, my god!

20:59.859 --> 21:01.892
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

21:01.894 --> 21:03.494
Seriously?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.029
This feels right to you?
