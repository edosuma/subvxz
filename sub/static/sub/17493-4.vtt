00:02.000 --> 00:03.960
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!

00:03.960 --> 00:05.960
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!

00:07.200 --> 00:09.400
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!

00:10.960 --> 00:12.720
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!

00:15.440 --> 00:18.320
Sarah and Duck are in Sarah's bedroom,

00:18.320 --> 00:22.000
putting stickers in their Underwater World sticker book.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.840
- Very good.
- Thank you.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.840
Aren't you going to stick those ones in?

00:29.840 --> 00:31.960
- Waiting.
- What for?

00:31.960 --> 00:34.040
To have them all.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.080
Oh, I see.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.880
So, who's meant to go there?

00:39.880 --> 00:42.200
Sea cow. Is the best one.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.920
Let's hope you find one in your new pack.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.400
Oh, yeah!

00:47.880 --> 00:51.600
Sea cow, sea cow, sea cow, sea cow, sea cow, sea cow.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.960
Dolphin?

00:54.960 --> 00:56.720
Ugh.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.920
Quack! Quack! Quack!

00:58.920 --> 01:01.120
How many is that now?

01:01.120 --> 01:03.160
- 11.
- Hmmm.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.320
If you have so many dolphins,

01:06.320 --> 01:09.280
someone probably has too many sea cows.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.400
Maybe they need my dolphins.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.920
Well, quite.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.400
- Come on, Duck.
- Let's go sticker-swap.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.920
So, you're certain Plate Girl collects stickers?

01:23.920 --> 01:25.800
Uh-huh. She has lots.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.400
- Hello.
- Ooh!

01:27.400 --> 01:29.360
What are you doing...

01:29.360 --> 01:33.680
- here?
- I'm trying to finish my sticker album and I need a...

01:33.680 --> 01:34.880
a sea cow.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.440
Oh. Wait here.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.680
Seems promising.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.720
Uh-huh.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.880
- Have you got one?
- No. I don't like sea cows.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.240
- Oh.
- So why did she go back indoors?

01:50.240 --> 01:52.280
I needed the loo.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.080
Ah. Right.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.280
And I got this.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.280
Not a sea cow.

01:59.280 --> 02:04.360
No, but I know who'd give you his sea cow sticker for it.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.720
Oh! I'll swap it for a dolphin.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.280
No, thanks. I'll take...

02:14.280 --> 02:15.760
this one.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.120
Don't you need that one?

02:19.120 --> 02:20.840
Yes.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.480
But...I can get another.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.920
- OK.
- Yes!

02:28.720 --> 02:32.840
- Squid plate! Aaah-haaaa!
- Hang on.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.320
Who's got this sea cow sticker, then?

02:35.320 --> 02:37.360
You won't believe it.

02:39.880 --> 02:43.640
Who knew that the librarian would collect stickers?

02:43.640 --> 02:46.680
- Plate Girl?
- Well, yes.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.440
Hey!

02:48.440 --> 02:51.200
- Quack!
- Shush.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.840
Plate Girl says you collect stickers and you need this one.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.600
- Can I have your sea cow, please?
- Oh!

02:57.600 --> 03:00.520
Yes, this way.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.880
Whoa!

03:03.880 --> 03:05.920
So many.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.560
My dream is that one day they'll all be complete.

03:10.560 --> 03:14.160
But then they keep making new ones!

03:14.160 --> 03:16.040
Indeed.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.800
Let's see. Knights and dragons.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.560
Ah-hah!

03:21.560 --> 03:24.560
Yes, it should go just...

03:24.560 --> 03:26.920
Oh.

03:26.920 --> 03:30.720
That young fellow John came in yesterday with one

03:30.720 --> 03:33.360
- and I swapped it for, um...
- A sea cow?

03:33.360 --> 03:35.720
Yes, that was it.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.440
O-o-o-oh!

03:39.160 --> 03:43.560
But I believe John has two sea cows,

03:43.560 --> 03:47.280
and I think you could entice him to give you one...

03:47.280 --> 03:50.360
- with this.
- Ooooh.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.960
Shiny.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.920
So, what will you swap for it?

03:54.920 --> 03:56.080
Uh...

03:56.080 --> 03:58.920
- A dolphin?
- No.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.640
All I need is that elusive crab.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.120
Oh.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.760
Here you go.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.320
Aaah!

04:10.360 --> 04:13.520
Finally, it's complete!

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Come on, Duck. Thanks, Librarian.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.680
- Quack!
- Shush.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.120
- Hello, Sarah.
- John, I've got...

04:29.920 --> 04:31.200
Oh, dear.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.480
Aaah!

04:35.280 --> 04:37.040
Do you want to come in?

04:41.200 --> 04:45.080
We've been everywhere trying to swap for a sea cow.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.920
I've still got a spare one, if you want it.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.480
O-o-o-oh!

04:50.480 --> 04:53.680
I kept it because I thought you might need one.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.120
Well, that's wonderful news.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.080
Um...

04:58.080 --> 05:01.600
What do you want to swap for it?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.480
You can have all the dolphins.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.760
No, thanks. I have lots.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.000
Oh.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.440
But...I need a stickleback.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.080
Oh...OK.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.240
Yes!

05:17.680 --> 05:19.040
Never mind, Sarah.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.160
You got the sea cow in the end.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.440
But I gave away all the others!

05:25.120 --> 05:26.600
SARAH SIGHS

05:29.720 --> 05:32.560
This sticker's so good,

05:32.560 --> 05:35.040
I think it's worth more than one.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.320
- Here.
- Oh!

05:37.320 --> 05:39.200
Are you sure?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.720
Yeah.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.280
Hmmm.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.400
Looks lonely on its own.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.640
You could put in a dolphin.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.440
Quack!

05:54.760 --> 05:56.000
Maybe not.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.640
- Quack! Quack!
- Ugh!

06:05.640 --> 06:07.520
Quack!

06:07.520 --> 06:09.520
What is it, Duck?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.440
Oh!

06:13.800 --> 06:16.080
A perfect fit.

06:16.080 --> 06:21.120
- Clever Duck.
- Quack!
- Hmmm.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.760
This one.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.000
And this.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.600
Yes.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.440
Well, I never.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.840
It's a bit unusual, but...

06:39.840 --> 06:41.760
- It's better.
- Quack!

06:41.760 --> 06:43.000
Indeed.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.560
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!

06:48.840 --> 06:50.760
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!

06:52.080 --> 06:54.480
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!

06:56.200 --> 06:58.560
- Sarah and Duck.
- Quack!
