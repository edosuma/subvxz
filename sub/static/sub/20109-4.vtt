WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.971
Rick: Don't let any of those
things get away, Morty.

00:04.003 --> 00:04.971
It their DNA gets
into Earth's food chain,

00:05.005 --> 00:06.840
our entire species
could be sterilized.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.309
Then why aren't we killing them?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.810
Right, next time I need
a species sterilized,

00:09.843 --> 00:11.379
who's gonna do it for me, you?

00:11.412 --> 00:12.980
Whoa! Rick!

00:13.013 --> 00:14.482
I-Is that
the Vindibeacon?

00:14.515 --> 00:16.850
We're being called to assemble
by the Vindicators!

00:16.884 --> 00:18.819
I refuse to answer a literal
call to adventure, Morty.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.554
Let it go to voice mail.
Rick,

00:20.588 --> 00:23.224
the Vindicators only call when
the universe itself is at stake.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.858
They're the first line
of defense against evil.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.494
They're the guardians
of the unguarded!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.329
They're the writers of their own
press releases, Morty.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.864
They're a bunch of drama queens
that spend an hour talking

00:30.898 --> 00:32.866
and 20 minutes jumping around
while shit blows up.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.535
They're a phase.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.071
We did one, it was the big even
of that summer, let it die.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.240
I, Morty Smith, invoke my right

00:39.273 --> 00:41.842
to choose one in every 10
Rick and Morty adventures.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.877
God fucking damn it!
Read 'em and weep.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.214
Fine. But don't say
I didn't warn you.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.683
Yes! Vindicator Command Ship...
Beacon received.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.853
We're doing
Vindicators Twoooooo!

00:52.886 --> 00:54.355
Whoops.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.225
Uh, Morty, you might want
to freeze some sperm.

01:00.261 --> 01:08.261
**

01:08.402 --> 01:16.402
**

01:16.577 --> 01:24.577
**

01:29.123 --> 01:30.258
Supernova: Vindicators.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.592
Worldender is back,

01:31.625 --> 01:34.094
and this time he's out
to end more than worlds.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.730
We have reason to believe
his stronghold is located on...

01:36.764 --> 01:37.765
My balls.
Rick!

01:37.798 --> 01:39.467
The Terraneous system.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.237
Once in range, Million Ants
will scan for pheromone activity

01:43.271 --> 01:45.406
which should lead us
to the location of the base.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.475
Oh, that's Million Ants.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.577
I can't see the ants
from over here,

01:49.610 --> 01:50.744
I just assumed that was, uh,
turd man,

01:50.778 --> 01:52.646
wiggly turd man.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.249
Rick, stop!
Rick, you have something to add
to the briefing?

01:55.283 --> 01:57.751
Uh, yeah,
just a few more design notes...

01:57.785 --> 02:00.488
Um, this guy,
the, uh... the, uh...

02:00.521 --> 02:01.955
I am Crocubot.

02:01.989 --> 02:04.091
Right, Crocubot.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.960
So, you're half cold,
unfeeling reptile, half...

02:06.994 --> 02:08.496
also cold...

02:08.529 --> 02:10.598
equally unfeeling machine.
Yes.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.132
Wow. So, your origin
is what?

02:12.166 --> 02:14.602
Y-You fell
into a vat of redundancy?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.504
Got damn!

02:16.537 --> 02:18.272
Noob Noob,
we're having a briefing.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.773
If I can continue, Rick.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.109
I anticipate sophisticated
security measures.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.144
I trust
you can be of service there.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.347
Well, let me check my list
of powers and weaknesses.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.816
Ability to do anything...
But only whenever I want...

02:28.849 --> 02:30.651
Yeah, that sounds like
a job for me.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.287
I wish he had the ability
to check his attitude.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.955
Alan Rails,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.457
After his parents tragic death
in a railroad accident,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.659
he gained the power
to summon ghost trains.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.628
It's not all bad though,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.996
they were spared having to see
their grown son wear a WHISTLE.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.965
Got damn!

02:44.998 --> 02:46.500
Thanks, Noob Noob.
This guy gets it.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.803
**

02:49.837 --> 02:52.340
Vance Maximus,
Renegade Star Soldier...

02:53.674 --> 02:55.008
Sorry I'm late.
It was happy hour.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.311
Happy hour.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.647
Uh, I was also late
because of my drinking

02:59.680 --> 03:01.181
and mentioned it
to zero applause.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.651
Rick Sanchez.
Tinkerer of Terror.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.718
Man, that's hard to say.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.820
And... Morty, right?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.656
Whoa, yeah!
I never forget a kid.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.191
What do you say, Vindicators,
let's make this three for three?

03:11.225 --> 03:12.159
- Haha!
- Yes!

03:12.192 --> 03:13.994
Did he say "three for three"?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.829
Did he say he never
forgets a kid?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.531
You mean two for two,
right, Vance?

03:19.367 --> 03:23.203
Actually, we assembled
a second time last summer

03:23.237 --> 03:25.038
to fight Doomnomitron.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.841
So this is...
Vindicators Three?

03:27.875 --> 03:32.680
And you guys did
Vindicators Two... without us?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.416
I sense... insecurity.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.585
Are you sure there's not
just a picnic nearby?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.521
I guess he found his crowd.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.623
Pretty toothless stuff, guys.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.861
I hope you're happy with
the adventure so far, Morty.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.863
These guys are even lamer
than last time.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.732
We weren't here last time,
remember?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.867
They did a whole Vindicators
without us.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.536
A bunch of them got killed, too.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.906
They lost Lady Katana,
Calypso, Diablo Verde...

03:58.939 --> 04:01.609
Yikes. Yeah, things did feel
less diverse in there.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.945
This article says the reason
we weren't involved was...

04:04.978 --> 04:06.113
"personality conflicts."

04:06.146 --> 04:08.248
Don't worry, Morty,
they love you.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.117
Superheroes need
a wide-eyed unremarkable

04:10.150 --> 04:11.552
to tag along and react
to everything

04:11.585 --> 04:13.086
like it's mind blowing.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.457
I...think the personality
conflict might have been...

04:16.490 --> 04:17.891
you?

04:17.925 --> 04:20.428
Jesus...

04:20.461 --> 04:21.962
How awesome is that?

04:21.995 --> 04:23.431
I mean, they wanted
to not need me so bad

04:23.464 --> 04:25.265
they murdered three
innocent heroes of color

04:25.299 --> 04:27.067
and they still
had to bring me back?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.802
Rick, since
it's my adventure and all,

04:28.836 --> 04:30.404
could you do me a favor?

04:30.438 --> 04:33.140
Uh, the adventure
is the favor, Morty.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.275
Me sleeping on these linens
is the favor.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.111
I mean, w-w-what... what are we
vindicating? Comfort?

04:38.145 --> 04:39.747
Rick, this really bums me out.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.416
It-It's embarrassing to find out
these guys don't like us.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.151
Why? Morty
I defeat gagoos

04:44.184 --> 04:46.253
more powerful than these guys
every week.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.755
Yeah, but not heroes.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.257
Oh, please, they just call
themselves heroes so they can...

04:50.290 --> 04:53.961
I'm calling them that, Rick!
They're my heroes. Mine!

04:53.994 --> 04:55.929
**

04:55.963 --> 04:58.932
Huh, no accounting for taste.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.668
I'm gonna go get a drink.

05:00.701 --> 05:08.442
**

05:08.476 --> 05:10.177
PA System:
Good morning, Vindicators.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.346
Ship has arrived
at Terraneous system.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.949
All Vindicators report
to the... briefing room.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.318
The... The room
from the, uh... the...

05:18.352 --> 05:19.987
Uh, it's the d...
It's a different room than...

05:20.020 --> 05:21.622
Than conference room.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.358
I'm sorry, it's my first day
as a PA System.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.994
First-day jitters.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.798
Oh, God.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.467
Good morning. Looks like your
grandpa had a long night.

05:33.501 --> 05:36.169
Crocubot, why don't you
escort Mr. Sanchez

05:36.203 --> 05:38.972
to a more comfortable spot
so that someone can...

05:39.006 --> 05:41.475
clean up his diarrhea.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.478
Oooh, I'm nervous
about my first mission!

05:44.512 --> 05:46.980
Actually, Noob Noob,
you have a new mission.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.684
Got... damn.
Vindicators,
prepare for arrival.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.387
Morty, the Vindicators and I
had a chat this morning,

05:53.421 --> 05:55.656
and I'm afraid we need
to make a little change.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.859
I-I totally get it.
I-I'm so sorry.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.160
You should be.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.028
Running around
in a yellow T-shirt

06:01.061 --> 06:02.229
like you're not one of us.

06:02.262 --> 06:05.866
Disgraceful.
I-I-I'm not a superhero.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.067
Cop a squat, chief.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.002
Everyone in the universe
is a hero.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.004
All you have to do is know the
difference between good and bad,

06:11.038 --> 06:12.406
and root for good.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.875
Rick says good and bad
are artificial constructs.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.210
Yeah, well, I get the feeling...

06:17.244 --> 06:19.547
He kind of needs that
to be the case.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.881
Not coming, Noob Noob?

06:20.914 --> 06:25.586
Ohh! No, uh,
I got stuff to do here.

06:25.619 --> 06:32.092
**

06:32.125 --> 06:34.394
Vance:
Security drones, inbound.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.230
Star Mother,
grant me your wrath.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.436
All aboard!

06:44.772 --> 06:48.576
**

06:54.815 --> 06:57.084
Gun turret.
Are you all right?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.052
Yes. I only lost 400 ants.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.888
My queen is laying more.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.724
I am back to...
one Million Ants.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.258
Someone wake up Sanchez.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.062
Ugh! Oh, Christ.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.564
Rick. You're up.
Barely.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.299
We're taking fire
from an automated turret.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.101
Can you bring it offline?
Uh-huh.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.813
Uh, my God,
that's better.
Rick!

07:25.846 --> 07:27.648
Hey, I can't help
if I can't see.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.836
I could've just used
a ghost train.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.471
Really? You don't say.
You would've used a ghost train?

07:51.505 --> 07:53.941
Hey, everybody,
the ghost train guy

07:53.974 --> 07:55.943
would have used a ghost train.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.444
- Man, Fuck you.
- Is there coffee?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.112
Hey, Morty, can you be a pal,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.480
Grandpa left his coffee maker
on the ship,

08:00.514 --> 08:01.782
you know,
the French press thing...

08:01.815 --> 08:02.816
Get it yourself.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.453
**

08:06.486 --> 08:08.656
Little extra snippy
this morning, aren't you?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.457
Just focus on the mission,
all right?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.626
Oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry,
oh, you're right.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.630
Ohh, real serious.
Gotta take it real serious, huh?

08:16.664 --> 08:20.300
Son of a Steam Engine.
They're all dead.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.303
Why would Worldender do this
to his own men...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.472
and several women?
Well,
he is the Worldender.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.675
The guy ends worlds.
Kind of his thing.

08:27.708 --> 08:31.011
Ohh, real scared.
Real fucking on alert,

08:31.044 --> 08:33.313
high alert over here.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.482
Watch out!

08:35.515 --> 08:36.515
What the fuck?!

08:36.515 --> 08:38.818
It's Worldender!
What happened to him?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.489
I sense his life force
is fading.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.324
Million Ants,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.660
The ant colony with the power
of two human eyes.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.530
All right. Short mission.
Good mission.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.733
Remember when Alan
wanted to use a ghost train?

08:52.766 --> 08:55.502
See you guys
in Vindicators Four. Morty?
Rick, whoever did this

08:55.535 --> 08:57.170
is an even bigger threat
than Worldender.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.505
We can't leave now.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.208
He's right.
This is far from over.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.409
Well, have fun with that,

09:02.442 --> 09:04.344
but Morty and I have to meet
a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,

09:04.377 --> 09:06.513
Two Assholes, and a
Full Alligator in like an hour.

09:08.115 --> 09:16.115
**

09:19.793 --> 09:20.694
Shit.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.429
I sense the presence

09:22.462 --> 09:24.131
of a greater evil.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.100
Drunk Rick:
Check, check. One, two.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.370
Okay. Is it recording?
Good.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.872
Hello, Vindicators.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.541
Welcome to your reckoning, baby!

09:34.574 --> 09:36.944
Welp, it's official.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.079
I had too much to drink
last night.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.883
If you guys are watching this,

09:42.916 --> 09:44.618
you're, you know,
the Vindicators.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.621
So, now that we know...
Rick?
What's going on, buddy?

09:47.655 --> 09:50.624
Obviously, I came here
last night during a blackout.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.459
"Obviously?"

09:52.492 --> 09:54.394
You came here and defeated
our arch nemesis...

09:54.427 --> 09:56.797
while so drunk
you don't remember doing it?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.799
That's something "obvious"
to you?

09:58.832 --> 10:01.068
Look, I'm a lit... little
more complex than you guys,

10:01.101 --> 10:02.803
and, no offense,
but I've always suspected

10:02.836 --> 10:04.304
that a lot of what you do
in a year

10:04.337 --> 10:05.673
could be knocked out
in a couple of hours.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.408
So I thought, why not
just do your job for you,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.577
so we can have
a little fun game.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.813
**

10:12.846 --> 10:14.815
Rick, is...
Is this a "Saw" thing?

10:14.848 --> 10:17.084
Are you seriously
Sawing the Vindicators?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.252
Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.655
If you break the rules,
lose the game or try to leave,

10:21.689 --> 10:22.990
you will die.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.025
Like in "Sawwww."

10:25.058 --> 10:26.493
Well,
I-I-I think we've seen enough,

10:26.526 --> 10:28.161
I'll just figure out
how to unplug this.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.515
Okay, here we go.
Room number one.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.431
The Vindicators are known
throughout the galaxy,

10:31.464 --> 10:34.201
but do they know yourselves,
do you know yourselves?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.837
Match your... your shit,
your... your gimmicks,

10:36.870 --> 10:40.340
with your faces, and y-you get
it, it's a matching thing.

10:40.373 --> 10:44.044
And do it in three minutes
or you'll all die.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.880
Screw this.
I'm not playing his game.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.115
I'm gonna find us
a way out of here.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, Vance.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.018
He said you'd die
if you tried to leave.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.291
That means there's booby traps.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.955
Why are you acting
like that's not you?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.456
What part of "blackout"
don't you understand?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.858
I thought you drank.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.193
Like cool drinking!
Like sexy drinking,

11:00.227 --> 11:02.696
not this psycho,
trailer-park shit!

11:02.730 --> 11:04.531
Vance, stay calm...

11:04.564 --> 11:06.466
Oh, so you're the leader now,
because we gave you a jacket?

11:06.499 --> 11:09.036
You're the learning-disabled kid
we do photo ops with.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.470
Okay, ouch, but...
Okay, this...

11:10.503 --> 11:13.707
This is triggering me.
I need space.

11:13.741 --> 11:17.544
I-I need space from this!

11:29.589 --> 11:34.728
**

11:34.762 --> 11:40.100
**

11:40.133 --> 11:42.002
Give me one reason

11:42.035 --> 11:43.737
why I shouldn't crush
your windpipe.

11:43.771 --> 11:47.074
Because my epidermis is laced
with a nanofiber defense mesh...

11:47.107 --> 11:49.409
And because, like I said,
I don't remember last night.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.945
I told you not to invite this
mummified motherfucker back.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.346
Alan, I'm not proud
of what's happening here,

11:53.380 --> 11:55.115
but if you keep coming at me,

11:55.148 --> 11:56.583
there's gonna be another
passenger on that ghost train.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.452
Guys! I figured it out.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.422
- Congrats!
- You did it it!

12:02.455 --> 12:05.759
It was a bit. All of the
descriptors apply to all of you.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.360
Drunk Rick's point

12:07.394 --> 12:08.762
is that none of you
are very special or different.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.597
That's always his point.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.933
Let's just get through this
as quickly as possible.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.701
Then we'll deal
with the two of you.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.470
The two of us?
I hope you're proud of yourself.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.940
Uh, I kind of am. I saved
the God damn universe.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.374
That's not the issue, Rick!

12:21.408 --> 12:23.777
Ahh, it would've been
if I hadn't!

12:23.811 --> 12:25.312
The Vindicators say their job

12:25.345 --> 12:27.314
is to fight evil
wherever it hides,

12:27.347 --> 12:30.283
but they don't...
Pick the location you'll...

12:30.317 --> 12:32.820
You'll never hear them
even mention,

12:32.853 --> 12:35.956
because to fight darkness
is to fight yourself.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.958
Oh! I know this.
Dorian 5!

12:37.991 --> 12:39.159
Crocubot, don't!

12:39.192 --> 12:41.628
There's no other
possible answer.

12:41.661 --> 12:45.132
My mechanical and reptilian
logic are certain of it.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.499
Oh!

12:46.533 --> 12:48.668
Huh! I'm seeing more croc
than bot here.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.403
God damn it!

12:50.437 --> 12:52.305
Uh, what happened
on Dorian 5?
Nothing!

12:52.339 --> 12:55.742
Nothing? We exterminated
a planet.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.477
W-Wait. Huh?

12:57.510 --> 13:00.180
Doomnomitron was hiding there!
He's a shapeshifter.

13:00.213 --> 13:03.250
Destroying Dorian 5
was the only way to kill him.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.651
Come on, guys,
we're all thinking it.

13:04.684 --> 13:05.986
Don't...

13:06.019 --> 13:07.019
Don't make me say it.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.488
Oh, okay. This again.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.657
You know,
I could have made you a device

13:10.690 --> 13:13.493
to detect Doomnomitron from
orbit like that.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.363
I'm not the one that
didn't want you back. Alan was.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.833
If you lay those deaths
at my doorstep one more time...

13:19.867 --> 13:22.035
Do not threaten her.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.204
Congrats, you did it.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.506
What the hell is "Israel"?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.208
It-It's just something
Rick starts talking about

13:28.241 --> 13:29.442
when he's blackout drunk.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.044
W-What?
In w... In w-w-what?

13:31.078 --> 13:33.013
Like,
w-w-what's my point?

13:33.046 --> 13:34.848
In a way that has no point,

13:34.882 --> 13:35.949
you just babble about defense
budgets and the United Nations

13:35.983 --> 13:37.517
and then you pass out.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.120
So, to be clear,
I sometimes reference

13:40.153 --> 13:42.856
the geopolitical complexities
of the topic...

13:42.890 --> 13:45.225
Which is not the same as going
to an anti-Semitic place.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.894
I have not stake in this...

13:46.927 --> 13:48.795
I don't either, I'm...
I'm just saying, if anything,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.064
the drunk version of me is
probably so supportive of Israel

13:51.098 --> 13:52.532
he wants what's best for it
and...

13:52.565 --> 13:55.802
Hey, man, I'm not touching this.
You do you.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.538
**

13:58.571 --> 14:02.042
Aloha... means hello
and goodbye in Hawaii.

14:02.075 --> 14:05.478
But, uh, aloha means...

14:05.512 --> 14:07.247
Has nothing to do
with this room.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.482
I'm so fucking drunk.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.318
Ugh, okay.
Here's the deal.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.086
I-I want to rest my eyes
for a little bit,

14:13.120 --> 14:14.554
I'm...
I'm not going to sleep,

14:14.587 --> 14:16.323
I just... just need
to rest my eyes,

14:16.356 --> 14:17.891
so let's make this one simple...

14:17.925 --> 14:19.893
Just... try to hit
some three pointers.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.595
Let's say... you have to
hit... five three pointers

14:22.629 --> 14:24.898
in... five minutes... or...
I don't know,

14:24.932 --> 14:26.900
the whole place... the
whole planet will get blown up

14:26.934 --> 14:28.668
with a n-neutrino bomb.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.737
And try to make it a-a lesson
about... yourselves,

14:30.770 --> 14:32.739
like... like
how selfish you are...

14:32.772 --> 14:33.941
Are or something.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.608
And also Hawaii.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.510
You guys hit the baskets,

14:37.544 --> 14:40.080
I'll disarm the
drunkenly-improvised
neutrino bomb.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.082
There's a 40 percent chance
it's a dud,

14:42.115 --> 14:43.750
but y-you should still
stay back.

14:43.783 --> 14:44.863
Morty, how many of these...

14:44.884 --> 14:46.519
Too many, Rick! Too many!

14:46.553 --> 14:49.957
Man, I am really getting
high-roaded today.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.261
That's a three pointer.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.929
Nice shot.
Thank you.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.931
You two make quite a team.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.766
We all do.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.101
Yeah, I guess...

15:01.134 --> 15:02.602
That's a three pointer.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.706
But you guys have always had
a... an unspoken bond.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.609
I mean, really unspoken.

15:09.642 --> 15:13.313
Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband
unspoken.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.784
We aren't married anymore, Alan.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.619
Sure, but were we married

15:19.652 --> 15:23.390
when you two were "stranded"
on Delphi Six for three days?

15:23.423 --> 15:28.128
Because I sensed something
was weird when you came back...

15:28.161 --> 15:30.397
But what do I know
about sensitivity?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.632
I'm just
a phantom train conductor.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.568
You're the pile of ordinary bugs
that fucked my wife!

15:35.602 --> 15:38.405
That's a three pointer.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.639
Where the fuck is the lead wire?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.308
You always put it
in the weirdest place.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.575
Um, uh, over here maybe?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.411
Jesus Christ,
what a shitty neutrino bomb.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.146
It's a miracle I ever
actually destroy anything.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.814
Oh, I don't know,

15:47.847 --> 15:49.182
you managed to destroy
just about everything today.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.650
The villains, the heroes,

15:50.683 --> 15:52.252
the lines between them,
my childhood...

15:52.285 --> 15:53.920
Thank yeewwwwww.
I appreciate it, Morty,

15:53.953 --> 15:55.422
I know you were sucking
the Kool-Aid

15:55.455 --> 15:56.489
out of the Vindicators' dicks

15:56.523 --> 15:58.358
so the fact that I was right
about them

15:58.391 --> 15:59.551
must be pretty hard to admit.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.328
Yeah, it is.
You know why, Rick?

16:01.361 --> 16:02.662
Because when you're an asshole,

16:02.695 --> 16:04.164
it doesn't matter
how right you are,

16:04.197 --> 16:05.837
nobody wants to give you
the satisfaction.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.168
I know. Everyone wants people
they like to be right.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.170
That's why popular people
are fucking dumb.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.604
And why your pretentious,
poorly-written,

16:11.638 --> 16:13.206
high-budget friends
back there

16:13.240 --> 16:14.841
can eat a double-decker
shit sandwich.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.276
Disarmed.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.678
Holy shit.
You're jealous.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.613
Yes! Is that
what you want to hear?!

16:20.647 --> 16:21.781
Did it feel good?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.351
Did you like his six million
wriggling legs

16:24.384 --> 16:26.519
more than
my tragedy-stricken,

16:26.553 --> 16:29.356
half-ghost,
half-tumescent penis?!
Guys, stop!

16:29.389 --> 16:31.691
You're just proving
my asshole grandpa right!

16:31.724 --> 16:35.062
You wish this was about sex!
We loved each other!

16:35.095 --> 16:37.297
We had a child together!
What?!

16:37.330 --> 16:41.034
I conceived a child
with Million Ants
and it died inside me

16:41.068 --> 16:45.405
because it was half a million
ants and half collapsing star!

16:45.438 --> 16:49.376
And yes.
He was better than you.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.477
Yeah?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.212
One... million...
times... better.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.048
All aboard, motherfucker

16:55.082 --> 16:57.084
Stop!

16:59.286 --> 17:02.089
Oof!
Didn't see that coming.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.656
Is that sarcasm?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.724
I don't want you slipping away
when this is over.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.493
All of these deaths
are on your hands.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.061
Okay, come on,
maybe a couple of them,

17:09.096 --> 17:10.163
but definitely
not the Train Guy.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.431
Oof!
All of them.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.565
Oookay.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.068
Congrats. You did it.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.905
All right, by now,
I've been pretty clear

17:18.938 --> 17:21.074
that I think the Vindicators
are full of shit.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.910
But... you do have one thing
that I'll never have.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.912
And that thing is the only part
of the Vindicators

17:25.944 --> 17:27.680
with any value to me.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.016
If you know what it is,
place it on the platform.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.519
Guess wrong
and pla-planet will explode.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.020
And probably the solar system,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.922
'cause I kind of fucking
eyeballed the neutrino bombs

17:35.955 --> 17:37.690
on this one.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.927
So what's the trick? Morty,
you're the Drunk Rick expert.

17:40.960 --> 17:45.098
I think... no matter
what we put on there, we die.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.867
He said it's the part
of the Vindicators he values.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.935
That means nothing.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.370
He wants our last moment alive

17:50.403 --> 17:52.105
to be spent knowing
how few fucks he gave.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.474
Jesus! Okay,
open to second opinions.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.143
It could...
It could be Morty.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.544
What?
Hey, I don't know.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.878
I mean, look, when I get drunk,

17:58.911 --> 18:01.381
I get stupid and emotional
and there's no logic to it.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.716
It's, like,
it's possible I got so drunk

18:03.750 --> 18:06.286
I felt like I was losing Morty
to the Vindicators,

18:06.319 --> 18:08.488
and maybe this is
my way of saying, "Okay,

18:08.521 --> 18:10.957
you can have him but only if
you know how important he is,

18:10.990 --> 18:12.125
otherwise I'll kill you."

18:12.159 --> 18:14.794
That is a...
really specific guess.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.397
Look, I-I... there's
nothing in the room but us.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.299
I'm just using logic
to connect some dots,

18:19.332 --> 18:20.667
it's the best guess I've got.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.569
But you're betting our lives
on it.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.971
I'll cover that bet.
I get it.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.973
Well, Morty, I think
you're doing that smirky face

18:27.006 --> 18:28.975
because you're misinterpreting
the moment.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.178
I am not being coy
about some hidden love for you.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.813
I want to be really clear that
if anyone has a better guess,

18:33.846 --> 18:36.082
like, if I gave you
an amulet last night, or...

18:37.217 --> 18:39.085
Phew.

18:40.853 --> 18:41.853
Oh, shit.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.926
Sorry. I'm... not good
at goodbyes,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.596
and... I'm drunk,
so, you know, I just...

18:49.629 --> 18:51.931
It looks like I'm never
going to see you again.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.000
I can't really roll
with the hero types.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.436
And I don't... they...
They don't want me around.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.839
But I want you to know, even if
I didn't show it at the time,

18:59.872 --> 19:02.209
I really appreciated
you sticking by me.

19:02.242 --> 19:06.379
God damn it, why am I crying?
It makes no sense.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.947
Ugh, you're...
You're probably confused

19:07.980 --> 19:09.782
because we barely
knew each other,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.351
but you really
stuck your neck out

19:11.384 --> 19:12.519
when you gave me props
for my awesome jokes

19:12.552 --> 19:14.221
in the briefing room.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.023
Everybody else had their head
so far up their ass.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.625
Even my own grandson is like,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.360
"Oh, the Vindicators,
they're so cool."

19:20.393 --> 19:23.796
I mean, he's a moron,
that's their demographic.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.365
But you're different, Noob Noob.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.966
Mother fucker

19:26.999 --> 19:29.369
You're fucking cool.
And you're smart.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.071
And I bet
we coulda hung out and shit.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.407
And I hope you get to be
a full-fledged Vindicator

19:34.441 --> 19:36.075
and... and do...
Do me a favor,

19:36.108 --> 19:38.044
don't... don't let them know
I-I got emotional.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.146
But you can tell them one thing.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.048
Tell them I said...

19:42.081 --> 19:45.785
Oh fuck Okay. I just
shit myself. Okay, later.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.192
W... Dude, Morty,
what happened...
Shut up.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.230
I sense this means
we are not dying.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.565
Not all of us.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.766
Sweetheart.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.601
Just let Titty Bean do this,
Snuzzles.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.069
It's for the greater good.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.170
Greater good?
Titty Bean?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.772
It's like you said, Morty.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.907
There's no right or wrong...
Never said that.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.610
It's the galaxy's faith
in the Vindicators

20:10.643 --> 20:12.779
that keeps the galaxy secure.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.514
Yeah, I feel safer already.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.683
No doubt, who do we make
the check out to?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.685
I will say we are getting
some good licks in

20:18.718 --> 20:20.253
while choking to death...
Right?

20:20.287 --> 20:21.954
Titty Bean.
Listen to me.

20:21.988 --> 20:22.922
When you came to me,

20:22.955 --> 20:25.525
I was merely
a sentient colony of ants.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.595
It was your beliefs,
your pursuit of justice...

20:28.628 --> 20:30.263
that taught me to be a man.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.533
When did it get so complicated?

20:33.566 --> 20:36.202
Who knows.
But we can make it simple again.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.870
You were always the romantic.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.273
Which is why you can't leave,
either.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.212
I'm sorry, my love.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.715
Damn! She double-crossed
Snuzzles!

20:48.748 --> 20:51.618
Silence!
I'm going to enjoy this...

20:51.651 --> 20:54.454
Announcer: Let's give
a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez

20:54.487 --> 20:56.956
for killing Worldender, putting
this awesome party together,

20:56.989 --> 21:00.327
and for booking one of
the hottest talents out there...

21:00.360 --> 21:03.896
Logic!
Logic: Awe, yeah.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.498
Look at that.
It's going down.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.133
Geez, I must have planned
a whole party.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.968
- It's Logic, y'all.
- Invited a bunch of people.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.303
- Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.
- Shout out to my boy, Rick.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.138
Are you ready?

21:12.171 --> 21:14.006
* There's a choo-choo train man,
he's rolling down tragedy *

21:14.040 --> 21:15.975
* Everybody knowing Supernova
fights gravity *

21:16.008 --> 21:18.811
Rick,
Supernova's getting away.
Eh, who cares?

21:18.845 --> 21:20.246
But... she was trying
to kill us.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.081
Morty, 20 people
try to kill me every week.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.516
I end up getting high
with half of them.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.518
I mean, check it out,
Gearhead's here.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.986
* There's this dude
Million Ants *

21:27.019 --> 21:28.154
Hmm. Well, that's gonna shoot
through me.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.323
Morty, you're wearing
a Vindicator jacket.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.924
Are you a little superhero now?

21:31.958 --> 21:33.860
Everyone in the universe
is a hero, Mom.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.528
Which is why
we don't need jackets.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.362
And I'm pretty sure
we don't need Vindicators.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.998
Don't mind if I do.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.534
Hey, everybody!
Look who's a Vindicator!

21:41.568 --> 21:45.338
Man, Grandpa Rick
must have gotten shitfaced.
Shut up, Summer.

21:45.372 --> 21:47.874
* Can't forget about the one who
never seems to get a chance *

21:47.907 --> 21:49.542
Noob Noob!
* All the bitches
come around for *

21:49.576 --> 21:52.178
Noob Noob!
* His dick gets
more visits than *

21:52.211 --> 21:54.180
* YouTube
Who the fuck
is Noob Noob?

21:54.213 --> 21:56.783
Noob Noob!
* Say, everybody,
everybody is *

21:56.816 --> 21:58.951
Yo, it's Logic once again,
y'all.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.353
Don't forget the name.

22:00.387 --> 22:01.788
Make sure you get home safe.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.055
And, man, we gotta all
give it up for Rick,

22:03.089 --> 22:05.024
'cause, I mean,
what kind of mother

22:05.057 --> 22:07.360
just sets up
a whole festival like this

22:07.394 --> 22:09.396
when he's completely loaded,
man?

22:09.429 --> 22:13.032
And all that stuff I said about
Vance, that's not real.

22:13.065 --> 22:16.068
Vance that guy, that guy sucks

22:16.102 --> 22:18.738
Whoo!

22:18.771 --> 22:20.306
Yeah!

22:20.339 --> 22:22.742
Yo...

22:22.775 --> 22:25.978
D-Did I get paid yet?
Whoo!

22:26.012 --> 22:28.047
**

22:28.080 --> 22:30.817
I can't believe we're getting
Gear Cream with a Vindicator.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.921
So, you girls in Gear college
or Gear...

22:34.954 --> 22:37.056
Alien terror attack!

22:37.089 --> 22:41.428
Okay. Sounds like
a job for... me.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.831
I better go
get into my alter ego.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.499
So cool.
I know.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.601
Wait, what alter ego?

22:48.635 --> 22:50.403
He was already wearing
the jacket.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.240
Gotta know when to hold 'em
and...

22:54.273 --> 22:55.273
Aaaaah!
