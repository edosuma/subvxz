WEBVTT

00:04.622 --> 00:05.965
Hey Kenny, you got a minute?

00:05.999 --> 00:08.140
Yeah, sure, what's... up?

00:08.175 --> 00:10.413
Good talk, bad talk?

00:10.447 --> 00:11.671
You're... you're not in trouble.

00:11.695 --> 00:13.591
We all know you've been
asking for more responsibility,

00:13.615 --> 00:16.631
and Topher could use some help running
the shift, so he can see more patients.

00:16.655 --> 00:17.900
You're a hard worker and...

00:17.935 --> 00:19.974
maybe you play too many practical jokes,

00:19.985 --> 00:22.378
but you have the respect of the
staff, and everybody likes you.

00:22.379 --> 00:25.005
- Uh, I don't know about everybody.
- Except him.

00:25.039 --> 00:25.977
Anyway, we got the budget

00:25.983 --> 00:27.223
For a charge nurse position.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.189
So, if you want the gig...

00:29.196 --> 00:30.579
Are you kidding me?
Yeah... yeah, I want it.

00:30.580 --> 00:31.245
All right.

00:31.279 --> 00:33.310
- When... when would I start?
- Uh, right now.

00:33.976 --> 00:36.326
Male, 50, single stab wound
to the upper right arm.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.316
He's tachy to the 120s, but
overall, vitals are stable.

00:38.317 --> 00:40.659
- Second gurney behind me.
- Okay, what happened, sir?

00:40.659 --> 00:42.834
- His daughter did this.
- No. No, she didn't.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.008
It was an accident. I fell.

00:44.009 --> 00:45.561
Hey, Ragosa, you're with T.C. in Trauma 2.

00:45.562 --> 00:46.092
I'm on it.

00:46.127 --> 00:48.743
What have we got?

00:48.780 --> 00:50.241
- Don't touch me! Stay away from me!
- Female, 20 years old,

00:50.242 --> 00:51.638
laceration to the left cheek.

00:51.639 --> 00:52.141
Ugh!

00:52.175 --> 00:53.663
She's delusional with
auditory hallucinations.

00:53.664 --> 00:54.413
Okay, hold on, I'll look.

00:54.414 --> 00:56.109
- Ah, you're monsters! Stay away from me!
- Ma'am...

00:56.110 --> 00:57.310
- Hey!
- Don't touch me!

00:57.311 --> 00:58.461
- No biting.
- I'll kill you!

00:58.462 --> 01:00.461
Push 5 of Haldol, I.V.

01:01.330 --> 01:02.608
Good news.

01:03.254 --> 01:04.830
Wound is superficial.

01:05.758 --> 01:08.397
We'll suture you right up.

01:08.398 --> 01:10.092
You'll be good as new.

01:10.441 --> 01:12.455
Ragosa, what would you do next?

01:12.455 --> 01:14.822
I irrigate, you numb the wound.

01:14.823 --> 01:15.750
Mm-hmm.

01:15.751 --> 01:17.850
There was an... there was an officer

01:17.851 --> 01:19.929
that came with the paramedics.

01:19.930 --> 01:21.167
Can you do me a favor?

01:21.168 --> 01:24.300
Just tell him that my daughter
had nothing to do with this.

01:25.156 --> 01:26.626
Pretty hard to fall on a knife.

01:26.637 --> 01:28.139
Come on.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.442
Don't worry. You can trust me.

01:30.994 --> 01:32.560
Look, I don't know.

01:32.594 --> 01:37.483
Amanda's just spiraled all day
until she finally just snapped.

01:37.484 --> 01:40.281
I just... I just... I just wanted to
calm her down, so I grabbed her arm,

01:40.282 --> 01:42.823
and she thought I was trying
to kill her, so she stabbed me.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.527
So I slapped her,

01:44.974 --> 01:47.980
and she hit her head off the counter.

01:49.078 --> 01:52.439
I just... I just can't
believe I hit my daughter.

01:52.882 --> 01:55.117
Sounds like self-defense to me.

01:55.118 --> 01:56.574
Dr. Callahan is right.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.109
If you wouldn't have stopped her,

01:58.110 --> 02:00.026
you would've come in here D.O.A.

02:00.027 --> 02:02.233
Hmm? Don't be so hard on yourself.

02:02.233 --> 02:04.408
I don't know. It's been six years.

02:06.488 --> 02:07.638
Nothing's changed.

02:07.639 --> 02:11.235
We've been to every
psychiatrist here in San Antonio.

02:11.236 --> 02:13.045
They say she's got bipolar disorder,

02:13.046 --> 02:14.309
delusional disorder.

02:14.310 --> 02:15.532
There's so many disorders,

02:15.532 --> 02:17.163
I don't even know how to keep track.

02:17.164 --> 02:19.402
I'll bet she's on a million
different meds, too, huh?

02:19.403 --> 02:22.864
Yeah. You name it, she's been on it.

02:22.865 --> 02:24.368
Nothing works.

02:25.847 --> 02:28.197
Shrink says I should put
her in an institution,

02:28.333 --> 02:30.411
but she's my little girl.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.332
I can't do that.

02:32.997 --> 02:34.946
I'm not giving up on her.

02:39.542 --> 02:40.788
Can I help you, Officer?

02:40.789 --> 02:42.914
This girl attacked her
Dad. She's out of her mind.

02:42.915 --> 02:44.544
She kicked me in the head
when I was helping the medics.

02:44.545 --> 02:46.555
Okay, uh, Heather, can you get the officer

02:46.556 --> 02:47.694
- an ice pack, please?
- Sure.

02:47.695 --> 02:49.529
- Thank you.
- Is she under arrest?

02:49.530 --> 02:50.799
Dad doesn't want to press charges,

02:50.800 --> 02:52.143
but it may not be his call.

02:52.144 --> 02:53.512
You think she's really nutso?

02:53.513 --> 02:57.168
Well, I'm not aware of "nutso"
as a technical diagnosis,

02:57.169 --> 03:00.127
but she does seem to be
experiencing some kind of psychosis.

03:00.128 --> 03:01.392
People also like to fake crazy,

03:01.393 --> 03:03.077
so they go to the hospital instead of jail.

03:03.078 --> 03:05.475
Thanks for the hot tip, but
she has legitimate injuries.

03:05.538 --> 03:07.136
We'll let you know when she's done.

03:07.137 --> 03:08.671
Fine by me. Thanks.

03:09.194 --> 03:11.050
I got plenty of paperwork
back at the station,

03:11.051 --> 03:13.932
but when I come back here, I'm either
taking her to jail or the nuthouse.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.040
Attention to orders.

03:19.258 --> 03:22.296
The secretary of the army
has reposed special trust

03:22.330 --> 03:24.279
and confidence in the patriotism...

03:24.280 --> 03:25.367
Thanks for inviting me.

03:25.753 --> 03:27.186
I've never been to a promotion ceremony.

03:27.187 --> 03:28.209
It's so exciting.

03:28.451 --> 03:30.625
Army promotions
are a lot tamer at home.

03:30.809 --> 03:31.776
If we were on deployment,

03:31.777 --> 03:33.412
my buddy Javy would be running into the mud

03:33.413 --> 03:34.499
getting punched in the chest

03:34.500 --> 03:36.260
by every NCO in his battalion.

03:36.409 --> 03:37.762
Well, let me know when you get promoted

03:37.762 --> 03:39.770
- 'cause I got a great right hook...
- 2015.

03:40.218 --> 03:43.223
Javier Luis Castro is therefore advanced

03:43.258 --> 03:45.368
from Sergeant to Staff Sergeant.

03:46.457 --> 03:48.088
Javy!

03:48.121 --> 03:50.551
Whoo!

03:53.978 --> 03:55.790
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

03:56.858 --> 03:58.552
Yeah, baby!

03:58.585 --> 04:00.503
Smile for that picture!

04:02.618 --> 04:05.976
- Staff Sergeant, congratulations again.
- Thank you, sir.

04:05.976 --> 04:08.091
I was just telling Captain
Alister and his lovely friend here

04:08.092 --> 04:09.908
you guys have a long career in the army.

04:10.234 --> 04:11.649
I hope you enjoy your work as much as I do.

04:11.673 --> 04:13.237
- Congratulations, again.
- Thank you.

04:13.238 --> 04:15.604
- You guys have a good evening.
- Thank you, sir.

04:15.865 --> 04:16.887
Thanks for coming, man.

04:16.921 --> 04:18.616
Wouldn't miss
it. Are you kidding me?

04:18.640 --> 04:19.351
So, where's the kids?

04:19.386 --> 04:22.743
Oh, they're with Javy's parents. We
booked a hotel downtown for the night,

04:22.778 --> 04:24.151
a little romantic staycation.

04:24.186 --> 04:26.071
I'll probably pass out in front of the TV.

04:26.106 --> 04:28.120
Sergeant romance over here.

04:28.153 --> 04:29.976
Right. Uh, sorry.

04:30.009 --> 04:31.683
- Yeah, this is Krista.
- Good to meet you.

04:31.684 --> 04:32.504
- This is Javy...
- Good to meet you, too.

04:32.537 --> 04:33.559
And his fantastic wife

04:33.594 --> 04:35.448
- that he does not deserve, Gina.
- Hi.

04:35.548 --> 04:37.209
- Hey.
- You hungry?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.095
- Yes. Let's eat.
- Mmm, come here.

04:39.288 --> 04:40.288
Bye.

04:41.658 --> 04:43.077
Krista's definitely a girl, right?

04:43.078 --> 04:44.770
- She's not one of those trans...
- What is wrong with you?

04:44.794 --> 04:46.072
I'm just asking, man.

04:46.106 --> 04:48.191
I'm just... You know, the world's
a complicated place these days.

04:48.192 --> 04:49.559
Screw you, Lee.

04:49.594 --> 04:50.423
- Colonel!
- Gun!

04:50.458 --> 04:51.991
Everybody down!

04:57.817 --> 05:00.076
- Gina!
- Get the gun!

05:00.077 --> 05:01.077
Gina!

05:01.365 --> 05:02.072
Drew!

05:02.105 --> 05:03.126
Help me!

05:05.000 --> 05:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:19.623 --> 05:21.804
Gina! No, baby, no. No.

05:21.805 --> 05:23.365
- You got him?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:23.428 --> 05:25.500
Hold on for me, Gina.
Come on, baby. Hold on.

05:25.501 --> 05:26.599
Somebody call an ambulance!

05:26.633 --> 05:28.273
My God, she's losing a lot of blood, man.

05:28.365 --> 05:29.448
Yeah, blood and artery.

05:29.481 --> 05:30.567
Gina.

05:30.601 --> 05:32.117
- Gina, stay with me, baby. Come on.
- What do you got, Krista?

05:32.117 --> 05:33.144
GSW to chest and neck.

05:33.145 --> 05:35.533
So far, only mild respiratory distress.

05:35.534 --> 05:36.689
I'm putting pressure on the neck wound,

05:36.713 --> 05:38.513
but I... I need internal
pressure right on the artery,

05:38.537 --> 05:39.623
or he's gonna bleed out.

05:39.657 --> 05:41.700
- Hey, sir, do you self-cath?
- Yeah.

05:41.701 --> 05:43.115
I need an unused Foley catheter.

05:43.116 --> 05:45.127
- Yeah, I got one.
- Javy, go grab that.

05:45.161 --> 05:47.239
Javy, grab that, give it to Krista.

05:47.273 --> 05:48.359
I got my hands full.

05:48.393 --> 05:49.425
Okay, so, Krista, what you're gonna...

05:49.449 --> 05:51.121
Yeah, insert the tube
in the colonel's neck,

05:51.145 --> 05:53.385
inflate the balloon, stop the
bleeding... I... I'm on it.

05:55.302 --> 05:56.896
Drew, what's happening to her?

05:56.897 --> 05:59.252
Yeah got her, Javy. I got
my finger on the artery.

05:59.253 --> 06:01.777
I need you to go out, direct the
paramedics back here when they get here.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.165
Go!

06:04.526 --> 06:06.239
- How's that going, Krista?
- It's in.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.283
Good.

06:07.721 --> 06:09.287
It's working.

06:09.321 --> 06:11.622
Great. We really gotta get
these two to the hospital.

06:14.871 --> 06:16.007
In.

06:16.256 --> 06:17.256
And out.

06:19.042 --> 06:21.479
Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Alexander.

06:21.513 --> 06:25.014
So, I understand that
Marcus has cystic fibrosis.

06:25.015 --> 06:27.531
We like to call it "65
roses." You know why?

06:27.532 --> 06:30.343
Uh, 'cause when it was first diagnosed,
most kids couldn't pronounce it,

06:30.344 --> 06:31.736
so the nickname took off.

06:31.737 --> 06:33.565
He's, like, the only
doctor who's known that.

06:33.571 --> 06:35.609
- Totally cool.
- Well... as you can see,

06:35.610 --> 06:37.831
you are in excellent
hands with Dr. Cummings.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.612
Uh, so it sounds like Marcus has...

06:39.613 --> 06:41.506
pneumonia. Third time this year.

06:41.507 --> 06:42.825
We just moved here from Dallas.

06:42.826 --> 06:45.223
These are his records from
the children's hospital.

06:45.437 --> 06:48.380
Pseudomonas... treated with
a week of I.V. gentamicin.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.524
Streptococcus... treated
with oral Augmentin,

06:50.525 --> 06:52.999
which gave him diarrhea, so
that antibiotic's a big fail.

06:53.033 --> 06:54.289
His stomach is already a big mess

06:54.313 --> 06:56.327
from the mucus buildup,
so start him on cefepime...

06:56.361 --> 06:59.207
1 gram every 8 hours until
his sputum culture is back.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.247
My mom's not being rude.
She's just efficient.

07:02.281 --> 07:05.402
That's... impressive. And it's
good that your mom knows her stuff.

07:05.403 --> 07:07.190
It makes our job a lot easier.

07:07.191 --> 07:10.174
So, Dr. Cummings, what would you suggest?

07:10.261 --> 07:12.583
Yeah, actually, I...
what she... what she said.

07:12.584 --> 07:15.504
Also, I would order a chest X-ray and
set him up for breathing treatments.

07:15.505 --> 07:16.918
Excellent. I'll leave you to it.

07:16.919 --> 07:18.207
It was nice to meet you both.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.399
You too.

07:19.433 --> 07:21.895
Okay, I'll get you started, all right?

07:23.401 --> 07:26.042
Amanda, I'm Dr. Zia.

07:26.043 --> 07:28.711
This is Dr. Callahan. How you feeling?

07:28.745 --> 07:30.887
My head's still fuzzy.

07:32.137 --> 07:35.626
- Oh, God, Dad. Did I do that?
- It's all right, honey. It's okay.

07:35.627 --> 07:37.455
- Don't worry about me.
- I'm so, so sorry.

07:37.456 --> 07:40.551
I don't know what's happening to
me. I've been so much better lately.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.617
I enrolled in a couple of college classes.

07:43.618 --> 07:45.764
I thought my meds were starting to work.

07:46.345 --> 07:50.055
Listen, uh, can we remove these
restraints? I mean, I think she's calm now.

07:50.089 --> 07:52.167
- Yeah, I think we can remove them.
- Sure.

07:55.536 --> 07:58.560
Ow. My back really hurts.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.006
Yeah, yeah, that's because the police
tackled you to the ground, honey.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.887
No, it's that same pain.

08:02.921 --> 08:06.086
My back. My stomach. They're killing me.

08:06.087 --> 08:06.853
The same pain?

08:06.854 --> 08:08.561
Yeah, yeah, she complains about this a lot,

08:08.562 --> 08:10.005
but doctors say it's psychosomatic.

08:10.006 --> 08:12.149
Why doesn't anybody believe me?

08:12.150 --> 08:14.840
It really hurts. All the time, I swear.

08:15.014 --> 08:16.596
By any chance, are you menstruating?

08:16.597 --> 08:19.655
Yeah, but I know what cramps
feel like. This is different.

08:19.689 --> 08:21.324
- Aah!
- Oooh.

08:21.325 --> 08:23.422
She does this a few
times a week exactly like this.

08:23.423 --> 08:24.752
Let's get her 5 of morphine.

08:24.753 --> 08:27.303
Toph. Stomach pain, back pain...

08:27.337 --> 08:29.799
could be appendicitis or pancreatitis.

08:29.832 --> 08:32.807
Maybe a kidney stones or ovarian cyst.

08:32.841 --> 08:35.303
Let's do a pelvic ultrasound
and an abdominal C.T.

08:35.304 --> 08:36.198
Yeah, yeah.

08:36.232 --> 08:37.895
Hey, you think this pain's real?

08:37.895 --> 08:39.299
- We're not sure.
- It is real.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.942
- We're gonna find out.
- Okay.

08:40.943 --> 08:42.919
It's all right. There you go.

08:43.541 --> 08:45.171
You can't do this to my daughter.

08:45.172 --> 08:46.930
Her birthday is in two days.

08:47.561 --> 08:51.335
I'll, uh... I'll pay
it off in installments.

08:51.369 --> 08:53.447
Please, I'm... I'm begging you.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.046
Damn it!

08:57.481 --> 08:58.535
I'm sorry.

08:59.151 --> 09:01.219
It's okay. I was just...

09:01.641 --> 09:02.721
I was just passing through.

09:04.937 --> 09:09.588
I just, um... I just lost the venue
for my daughter's quinceañera.

09:10.428 --> 09:12.167
Yeah. Oh.

09:12.201 --> 09:15.719
It's just with the, uh, divorce
and pay cut, man, it all adds up.

09:16.175 --> 09:18.695
And I just maxed out all my credit cards.

09:22.825 --> 09:24.583
Her birthday is in two days.

09:25.897 --> 09:28.423
If I don't find a place
for her to have this party,

09:28.457 --> 09:32.455
my daughter's gonna be crushed
and my ex-wife will kill me.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.855
Michael, I'm sorry. That's awful.

09:34.889 --> 09:37.359
Well, hey, look... is
there anything I can do?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.847
No, but thank you.

09:39.881 --> 09:41.567
I got myself into this.

09:41.592 --> 09:43.179
I'll get myself out.

09:43.767 --> 09:45.133
Incoming.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.363
Hey, what the hell happened, man?

09:47.364 --> 09:48.976
Shooter at the ceremony.
This is my friend, Gina.

09:48.977 --> 09:50.037
All right. Take her to Trauma 2.

09:50.038 --> 09:51.374
GSW to the parietal scalp.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.650
Hypotensive from blood loss.

09:52.651 --> 09:54.471
I've got my finger on
a pumping scalp artery.

09:54.505 --> 09:57.614
- GCS is 453. Make sure you get T.C.
- All right. Will do. Will do.

09:57.615 --> 09:58.869
Just stay awake, baby.
Stay with me. Please.

09:58.870 --> 09:59.847
You've got to keep calm for her, Javy.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.458
That's my wife! Don't
tell me to calm down, man!

10:01.459 --> 10:02.832
Hey, hey, sir, sir. Right here, right here.

10:02.856 --> 10:04.167
I know this is a terrible situation,

10:04.168 --> 10:05.585
but you're not helping
your wife, all right?

10:05.609 --> 10:07.287
So let Dr. Alister work.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.600
- It's the best thing you can do.
- Save her, Drew! Please!

10:09.601 --> 10:11.016
I got the colonel.

10:11.017 --> 10:11.951
All right, what do we got?

10:11.952 --> 10:13.820
GSW to the chest with
a complete heart block.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.922
The bullet must've injured
his atrioventricular node.

10:15.923 --> 10:17.361
He needs a pacemaker. I need Scott.

10:17.362 --> 10:19.351
Uh, he's not working
tonight. Uh, go up to surgery.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.112
- I'll page the on-call surgeon.
- All right.

10:23.785 --> 10:26.311
I'm gonna need another 2-0 Prolene.

10:26.345 --> 10:28.679
B.P.'s down to 76 systolic.

10:30.121 --> 10:31.719
Hey. What's going on?

10:31.752 --> 10:33.703
GSW to the scalp.

10:33.737 --> 10:35.527
Just grazed her, but nicked an artery.

10:35.561 --> 10:37.575
Yeah. A purse string
usually does the trick.

10:37.609 --> 10:38.922
Okay, I thought so.

10:38.923 --> 10:40.721
I just want to make sure
I didn't miss anything.

10:40.745 --> 10:41.983
Drew, you got this.

10:41.984 --> 10:43.463
Just keep doing what you're doing.

10:43.497 --> 10:45.383
I'm across the way if you need me. Okay.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.894
Let's cross and type for four

10:47.895 --> 10:49.456
and get two units on the rapid infuser.

10:49.481 --> 10:51.405
- I'm on it.
- Got it right here.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.726
- Say, Kenny...
- Yo.

11:05.737 --> 11:07.529
Hey, Gina. I'm Kenny.

11:08.088 --> 11:10.503
I got shot in the head?
Oh, God, I got shot.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.494
Gina, it's okay. We're fixing you right up.

11:12.495 --> 11:14.081
Okay, Gina, let's keep those eyes on me.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.600
Good, good. Let's take deep breaths.

11:17.609 --> 11:20.103
Yeah, here we go, let's take deep breaths.

11:21.257 --> 11:23.374
Hey, how about we take a little quiz?

11:23.375 --> 11:24.647
Huh, a fun, little quiz?

11:24.681 --> 11:26.033
Now, which do you think is bigger?

11:26.057 --> 11:27.331
Russia or Pluto?

11:28.008 --> 11:30.055
I don't know. Pluto.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.182
I know, that's the
thing, right? You'd think.

11:32.207 --> 11:33.780
But it's Russia.

11:33.781 --> 11:35.291
No wonder Pluto's not a planet anymore.

11:35.292 --> 11:37.452
We kicked its puny, little
ass out of the solar system.

11:38.055 --> 11:39.577
We want real planets up in here.

11:42.488 --> 11:44.008
They're trying to kill me!

11:44.009 --> 11:45.679
- Stay back! You're the devil!
- What are you doing?

11:45.703 --> 11:48.199
- Let's just take it easy! Please! Please!
- You're trying to control my brain!

11:48.200 --> 11:49.514
- Stay back!
- Let's just take it easy.

11:49.515 --> 11:50.802
Get out! No, aah!

11:50.803 --> 11:52.839
- Don't hurt her, please!
- Aah!

11:53.417 --> 11:56.038
Wait, what's happening to
her? She's not breathing.

11:56.475 --> 11:58.073
Get me a crash cart!

12:01.614 --> 12:02.765
Oh, hold the intubation.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.493
Her respirations are back to normal.

12:04.527 --> 12:06.861
Okay, wh... what happened to her?

12:06.896 --> 12:08.024
We don't know.

12:08.025 --> 12:09.379
Heather, she's still out.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.901
- Let's keep her on high-flow oxygen.
- Sure.

12:10.902 --> 12:13.370
Wait, she got you good. Let
me... let me clean that up.

12:13.371 --> 12:14.477
Thanks.

12:14.511 --> 12:17.437
Hey. Hey, uh, I'm really
sorry about that, okay?

12:17.438 --> 12:19.575
Don't worry about it. Happens
almost every other night.

12:19.599 --> 12:22.064
'Cause I feel like my daughter
is dying right in front of me,

12:22.065 --> 12:23.903
and... and no one can do anything

12:23.904 --> 12:25.239
- to... to stop it!
- Frank, Frank.

12:25.263 --> 12:27.524
- That's what I feel.
- Frank, the more physical symptoms,

12:27.525 --> 12:29.042
the more pieces we have of the puzzle.

12:29.043 --> 12:32.159
Okay, if we can pinpoint the
cause, then we can cure her.

12:35.215 --> 12:36.903
- What the hell is that?
- She's seizing.

12:36.904 --> 12:39.134
What do you mean "she's seizing"? What
are you talking about?! What do you mean?

12:39.135 --> 12:40.380
Kenny, could you take
Frank to the waiting room?

12:40.381 --> 12:41.614
- No, no, I want to stay with her.
- Now!

12:41.615 --> 12:42.519
No! Let me stay with her!

12:42.520 --> 12:44.408
- Let me stay here.
- Go to the waiting room now!

12:44.409 --> 12:45.887
The meds are in, but
she's not slowing down.

12:45.888 --> 12:47.107
Okay, load a gram of Dilantin.

12:47.108 --> 12:49.669
- Tee, what the hell?
- I don't know, Toph. I don't know.

12:50.219 --> 12:51.466
Blow on that for me, okay?

12:57.860 --> 13:00.070
His temp and respiratory
rates are... are going up.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.285
It's because it's not working.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.301
He's not responding to the cefepime.

13:08.336 --> 13:09.613
This happens sometimes.

13:09.648 --> 13:12.801
You can't quit the game
because I'm kicking your butt.

13:12.849 --> 13:14.353
One second, honey.

13:15.535 --> 13:18.605
Listen, has he ever gotten
a nebulized antibiotic?

13:18.640 --> 13:20.816
The, uh, the medicine will
go directly to his lungs.

13:20.817 --> 13:21.817
Yeah, good luck.

13:22.165 --> 13:24.514
You have to submit paperwork
to medicaid for approval.

13:24.515 --> 13:26.701
Other hospitals have tried. They all fail.

13:26.735 --> 13:28.397
Right.

13:28.431 --> 13:31.405
We do things a bit
different around here, okay?

13:31.918 --> 13:33.127
So, yeah.

13:33.128 --> 13:35.411
Hey, uh, Marcus, watch out for her knight.

13:35.412 --> 13:37.005
Okay, she's baiting you.

13:37.062 --> 13:38.911
Dude, I'm baiting her.

13:38.912 --> 13:40.269
Don't give up my strategy.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.741
Okay.

13:45.776 --> 13:47.309
It's my turn?

13:48.208 --> 13:49.208
Dad!

13:49.424 --> 13:50.479
Naomi?

13:50.759 --> 13:51.872
Lydia, what...

13:51.873 --> 13:53.676
Is it true that we're not
having my birthday party?

13:53.677 --> 13:55.426
This is unbelievable, Michael.

13:55.427 --> 13:56.647
You said you took care of it.

13:56.648 --> 13:58.837
Can we talk about this in private, please?

14:03.087 --> 14:05.236
Poor Michael. He's in deep.

14:05.236 --> 14:09.327
Yeah, I, uh... I heard that
Naomi's birthday party got canceled.

14:09.328 --> 14:11.420
Not just any birthday... her quinceañera.

14:12.505 --> 14:15.184
That's like a... it's like
a sweet sixteen, right?

14:15.185 --> 14:16.703
Sweet sixteen on steroids.

14:16.804 --> 14:19.149
You learn a bunch of dances,
put on a show for your guests,

14:19.183 --> 14:20.731
do a father/daughter dance.

14:21.462 --> 14:23.566
It's a milestone in a Latina's life.

14:24.090 --> 14:26.136
It's one of the best days of my life.

14:29.391 --> 14:31.916
Really, Lydia? You had
to come down here, huh?

14:31.917 --> 14:33.439
Because you didn't answer your phone.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.913
Because I am working.

14:34.914 --> 14:35.917
The hotel manager called

14:35.951 --> 14:37.901
and said we had pick
up all the decorations.

14:37.935 --> 14:40.259
I just wish
you would've told me.

14:40.260 --> 14:43.737
I'm sorry, bug. I was
trying to fix it first.

14:44.007 --> 14:46.781
But look, I'm... I'm gonna
make it up to you, okay?

14:46.782 --> 14:48.921
We'll have the party in a few months

14:48.922 --> 14:50.393
after I save up some money.

14:51.053 --> 14:54.474
You knew you couldn't afford
it. Why did you pretend?

14:54.475 --> 14:57.205
Because I underestimated expenses, okay?

14:57.206 --> 14:59.429
Listen, Naomi.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.845
Money's a little tight right now.

15:00.879 --> 15:04.492
I... I screwed up. I
know. I'm so, so sorry.

15:04.798 --> 15:06.889
Then you can call everyone

15:06.901 --> 15:09.007
and tell them it's canceled and why.

15:09.383 --> 15:12.947
I'm not taking crap for this. It's on you.

15:16.555 --> 15:18.088
I can't believe this.

15:18.089 --> 15:19.486
Wha... honey!

15:19.487 --> 15:20.883
C... come...

15:20.884 --> 15:22.117
I'm so sorry.

15:22.118 --> 15:23.469
Naomi!

15:25.455 --> 15:27.213
So, how you feeling?

15:27.247 --> 15:28.471
I have an epic headache.

15:28.472 --> 15:29.517
I would think so.

15:29.551 --> 15:31.507
You just had a bullet bounce off your head.

15:31.508 --> 15:34.413
Actually, I've been having
these headaches for a few weeks.

15:34.447 --> 15:37.118
- For a few weeks?
- I have been stressed out,

15:37.119 --> 15:38.694
waiting to hear if Javy
was gonna get promoted.

15:38.695 --> 15:39.923
I thought maybe that was the reason.

15:39.947 --> 15:42.015
Okay. Keep an eye on it.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.213
Baby.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.593
You're okay.

15:45.594 --> 15:48.570
Yeah. I'm just a little shaken up.

15:48.594 --> 15:49.660
Did you check on the kids?

15:49.661 --> 15:50.967
Yeah. Talked to my dad.

15:50.968 --> 15:52.841
Kids are asleep. They're
fine. You... you need anything?

15:52.842 --> 15:54.285
No, I just have a headache.

15:54.319 --> 15:55.917
I'm gonna talk to Drew.

15:55.951 --> 15:57.902
- Drew?
- Hmm?

15:57.935 --> 15:59.693
Man, I'm sorry for yelling at you, dude.

15:59.727 --> 16:02.206
- Yeah, it hurt my feelings.
- It did?

16:02.207 --> 16:04.622
- That's why I'm telling you I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

16:04.655 --> 16:07.479
But, uh, I heard the shooter

16:07.480 --> 16:09.565
was, uh, the colonel's brother-in-law.

16:09.967 --> 16:12.185
Yeah. Apparently, he was
pissed because the colonel

16:12.186 --> 16:14.049
wouldn't co-sign for him
on some business loan.

16:14.229 --> 16:15.229
He just lost it.

16:15.584 --> 16:18.521
So, the man does four tours in war
zones and the first time he gets shot,

16:18.522 --> 16:20.332
it's by his brother-in-law
over a business loan?

16:20.337 --> 16:21.337
- Yeah.
- Are you...

16:21.458 --> 16:22.794
What the hell's wrong with people?

16:22.794 --> 16:24.909
- I know, right.
- Hey, Gina.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.733
- Javy.
- Hey.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.525
Hey. Um...

16:28.559 --> 16:29.559
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:29.683 --> 16:32.571
So, I just finished with the colonel.
He's in recovery. He wants to see you.

16:32.572 --> 16:34.732
- But I need to show you something first.
- Yeah, sure.

16:38.268 --> 16:39.162
Ah, damn.

16:39.163 --> 16:40.461
Yeah.

16:40.495 --> 16:43.245
What? Is that Gina's X-ray?

16:43.929 --> 16:45.357
It's her C.T.

16:45.391 --> 16:46.777
When you use that tone, man...

16:46.778 --> 16:49.029
I know. Just... here, let
me show you both something.

16:49.317 --> 16:50.477
Hey.

16:50.511 --> 16:53.234
So, Gina, you have something called

16:53.235 --> 16:55.693
an arteriovenous
malformation in your brain.

16:55.727 --> 16:56.973
- It's an...
- It's an AVM.

16:57.007 --> 16:59.637
It's a huge spider web of
tangled veins and arteries.

16:59.638 --> 17:01.052
It's what's causing your headaches.

17:01.052 --> 17:03.078
- Krista, did you already call neurosurge?
- Yes, I let them know we need

17:03.079 --> 17:04.265
a stat AVM resection.

17:04.266 --> 17:05.655
I... I'll make sure the O.R. is prepped.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.160
What? Oh, my God.

17:07.161 --> 17:08.808
Drew, my head, it hurts.

17:08.809 --> 17:11.289
Yeah, we're gonna take care of
this right now. Okay, I promise you.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.666
Hold on. I don't understand what happened.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.243
She may have had the AVM since birth,

17:14.244 --> 17:16.438
but the force of the bullet hitting
her skull caused it to bleed.

17:16.439 --> 17:17.422
Her brain is bleeding?

17:17.423 --> 17:19.669
Yeah, and we gotta get it out before
it ruptures. We got to go. Now.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.791
- What? What? No.
- Okay, I love you. All right. I love you.

17:21.792 --> 17:22.961
Baby, I love you.

17:22.991 --> 17:24.141
She's my world. You make sure they fix it.

17:24.142 --> 17:25.830
- I know.
- Fix her, Drew. Fix her.

17:30.846 --> 17:31.709
Hey.

17:31.744 --> 17:33.758
Are you all right?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.805
No.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.673
My kid's completely destroyed,

17:37.674 --> 17:39.432
and it's all my fault.

17:40.159 --> 17:43.753
Well, I... I don't know what
it's like to be a parent,

17:43.754 --> 17:46.877
but, um, I do know what
it's like to be a daughter.

17:46.912 --> 17:49.085
And she's angry with you now,

17:49.120 --> 17:51.330
but it's just a blip in the big picture.

17:51.331 --> 17:54.155
Jordan, let me give you a little heads-up

17:54.166 --> 17:55.767
about being a parent.

17:56.074 --> 17:59.177
Your child's happiness and
well-being is all you think about.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.437
No matter what you're doing,

18:01.437 --> 18:04.350
no matter what's happening
in your day or at your job.

18:05.093 --> 18:07.909
Did they eat right?
What's happening at school?

18:07.991 --> 18:11.473
It's like a continuous soundtrack
running through your head.

18:12.064 --> 18:16.350
- So... all the time.
- Yeah, all the time.

18:16.558 --> 18:20.280
This party meant everything
to Naomi, and I let her down.

18:20.412 --> 18:22.205
She'll forgive me, but she'll never forget.

18:22.239 --> 18:25.855
And neither will I.

18:27.954 --> 18:29.266
Hey, Jordan.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.417
Yeah.

18:30.519 --> 18:32.940
Hey, uh, Marcus isn't
responding to cefepime.

18:32.941 --> 18:34.137
He needs nebulized antibiotics.

18:34.138 --> 18:36.417
Is there any way he can get them
before he submits to medicaid?

18:36.418 --> 18:38.190
Man, those medications
are pretty expensive.

18:38.191 --> 18:40.258
Uh, medicaid probably won't reimburse,

18:40.259 --> 18:42.843
and there's no way the
administration will approve of them.

18:42.844 --> 18:43.990
Okay, then I'll pay for 'em.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.298
If you pay for every drug
that's not covered by insurance,

18:47.299 --> 18:48.332
you'll be broke in a week.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.967
Okay, then I'll... I'll
worry about that next week.

18:49.973 --> 18:51.338
Paul, come on.

18:51.982 --> 18:55.052
Look, you have a big heart,
and I like that about you.

18:55.427 --> 18:56.685
But we need to be realistic

18:56.686 --> 18:59.880
about what we can and cannot do, all right?

18:59.981 --> 19:04.103
All right, I will try and fast-track
the paperwork on the medication,

19:04.104 --> 19:05.716
but it could still take a month.

19:06.172 --> 19:09.483
All right, so for now, add
on an I.V. aminoglycoside.

19:09.518 --> 19:11.152
All right, that might work.

19:11.386 --> 19:13.375
Okay, but, uh, this sucks.

19:14.023 --> 19:16.361
Yeah, it does.

19:20.832 --> 19:23.132
Hey. She really did get you.

19:23.133 --> 19:25.039
You're lucky she didn't break your nose.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.050
I kind of miss
a good punch to the face.

19:27.075 --> 19:28.685
You looking at Amanda's new labs?

19:28.686 --> 19:30.411
Yes. Give me a list of symptoms.

19:30.721 --> 19:33.228
Uh, seizures, respiratory
paralysis, stomach pains,

19:33.229 --> 19:34.941
back pains, skin lesions,

19:34.942 --> 19:36.236
paranoia, hallucinations.

19:36.237 --> 19:37.567
Could it be autoimmune hepatitis?

19:37.601 --> 19:38.879
We did a full immunity work-up.

19:38.913 --> 19:40.479
Autoantibodies were normal.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.281
- This is so frustrating.
- Yeah.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.851
Her father must feel so helpless.

19:43.852 --> 19:46.108
Yeah, I'm not looking forward to
this part of parenthood, by the way.

19:46.109 --> 19:47.111
Hey, we're doctors.

19:47.112 --> 19:49.151
We'll be more in control
of medical emergencies.

19:49.185 --> 19:50.665
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.991
You have no control.

19:51.992 --> 19:54.143
My daughter sneezes, I
get a chill up my spine.

19:54.177 --> 19:55.909
Yeah, but you're weird.

19:55.916 --> 19:58.156
Hey, guys. Hey, the
arresting officer just called.

19:58.157 --> 20:01.277
He wants to take her into custody. I
tried stalling him, but he's heading over.

20:02.196 --> 20:03.593
That sucks. We can delay him a bit,

20:03.617 --> 20:06.664
but if she wakes up and starts flipping
out again, she's off to the psych ward.

20:06.665 --> 20:08.390
You know what? When the cop
gets here, let me deal with him.

20:08.391 --> 20:11.321
- Yeah? How are you gonna do that?
- Don't you worry about it. I got this.

20:14.369 --> 20:16.671
How is Staff Sergeant
Castro's wife, Gina, doing?

20:16.705 --> 20:19.106
She's still in surgery. We'll
know more in a couple of hours.

20:20.577 --> 20:22.079
Hey.

20:22.113 --> 20:23.501
Colonel.

20:23.979 --> 20:25.675
Tell me you beat the
hell out of that coward,

20:25.676 --> 20:27.327
son-of-a-bitch brother-in-law of mine.

20:27.361 --> 20:28.971
I just did what I needed to do, sir.

20:29.123 --> 20:31.817
Yeah, there was a lot of people
there. You were the only one who acted.

20:31.841 --> 20:32.799
Thank you, sir.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.815
But we're here to talk about you.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.479
Dr. Bell-Hart assisted in your surgery.

20:36.513 --> 20:40.223
Right, so, Colonel, the bullet ruptured
your heart valve, and we replaced it.

20:40.257 --> 20:42.794
But the damage to your heart's
electrical system couldn't be repaired,

20:42.818 --> 20:44.238
and we had to fit you with a pacemaker.

20:44.262 --> 20:45.297
Oh.

20:45.761 --> 20:48.487
That's a disability
discharge from the army.

20:49.098 --> 20:50.732
I'm so sorry, sir.

20:51.025 --> 20:53.512
I can talk to the medical
evaluation board on your behalf.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.962
Maybe we can get a dispensation.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.521
This... this doesn't have to
mean the end of your career.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.474
Could you not do that?

20:59.507 --> 21:02.098
- Sir?
- I love the army, Captain,

21:02.131 --> 21:04.061
but I gave up everything for it.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.729
My marriage fell apart.

21:07.764 --> 21:10.513
I wasn't there near as much as
I should've been for my sons.

21:10.548 --> 21:12.241
It's time to make up for lost time.

21:12.275 --> 21:14.545
Getting shot kind of puts
thing into...

21:14.580 --> 21:16.943
Excuse me. Kind of puts things...

21:16.944 --> 21:19.306
Oh, look at his face. It's swelling.

21:20.092 --> 21:21.130
He's got hives.

21:21.131 --> 21:23.106
Get me EPI and start
Solu-Medrol and Benadryl.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.725
- He's going into anaphylactic shock.
- To what? He has no allergies.

21:25.726 --> 21:26.943
My chest burns.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.085
The pacemaker. He's got to
be allergic to the cables.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.312
- I'll call cardiology.
- No time.

21:35.313 --> 21:37.900
- We got to take the pacemaker out.
- Right now?

21:38.657 --> 21:40.172
- Now.
- Okay.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.468
We're gonna have to externally
pace him to keep him alive.

21:50.594 --> 21:52.344
He can't breathe! Help!

21:52.720 --> 21:54.280
Help! He can't breathe!

21:54.314 --> 21:55.721
He can't breathe! Do something!

21:55.722 --> 21:58.798
His... his oxygen level is dropping. I
need to put him on a vent. I need a nurse.

21:58.799 --> 22:01.416
It's gonna be okay, baby. Shh.
It's gonna be okay. Stay with me.

22:01.417 --> 22:03.275
I... I got you, on this,
okay. I got you, buddy.

22:03.276 --> 22:04.425
It's okay.

22:04.785 --> 22:06.089
Please.

22:06.122 --> 22:08.296
Grab a vent and set up to intubate.

22:08.330 --> 22:10.408
Please, Marcus, stay with me.

22:10.443 --> 22:11.849
- Come on.
- Marcus.

22:11.850 --> 22:13.285
It's going to be okay.

22:14.506 --> 22:16.360
Hey, there, Officer.

22:16.394 --> 22:17.961
My perp ready to go?

22:17.994 --> 22:21.115
Um, I'll check, but I think that
she's getting some more tests.

22:21.580 --> 22:23.186
But, hey, Officer, you know what?

22:23.557 --> 22:25.583
I am so glad that you came
back, because, you know,

22:25.584 --> 22:28.233
- I just couldn't get you out of my mind.
- Hey, Doc, I'm flattered, but I'm taken.

22:28.234 --> 22:29.084
What? No, no, no, no.

22:29.085 --> 22:32.145
Um, I'm concerned about
the kick to the head.

22:32.202 --> 22:33.817
I think you should get a C.T. scan.

22:33.818 --> 22:36.071
Seems kind of extreme.

22:36.173 --> 22:37.384
Well...

22:37.419 --> 22:40.518
Wouldn't it be extreme
if you didn't get the scan

22:40.519 --> 22:43.816
and you dropped dead from a brain bleed?

22:44.700 --> 22:47.528
Uh, yeah. O... okay.

22:48.057 --> 22:49.298
But how much is this gonna run me?

22:49.322 --> 22:50.376
Stop it.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.360
It's on the house for our boys in blue.

22:52.394 --> 22:53.448
Come on.

22:58.986 --> 22:59.849
Hey, bud.

22:59.882 --> 23:01.224
How's, uh... how's Marcus doing?

23:01.258 --> 23:04.072
Uh, terrible. I had to put him on a vent.

23:05.702 --> 23:06.536
Damn.

23:06.570 --> 23:08.043
Sorry you had to do that, man.

23:08.523 --> 23:09.523
Yeah.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.846
You should have seen the look on
his face when I had to intubate.

23:12.847 --> 23:14.246
I mean, the kid's only 9 years old.

23:14.247 --> 23:16.327
He's already been through
enough pain for a lifetime.

23:16.764 --> 23:17.739
It's just not fair.

23:17.740 --> 23:18.888
I hear that, man.

23:18.922 --> 23:21.192
Sick kids always mess me up, too.

23:21.543 --> 23:23.560
Hey, I'll keep good thoughts.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.758
You got the meds?

24:28.793 --> 24:29.818
Uh, yeah.

24:29.819 --> 24:31.382
Yeah, I figured something out.

24:31.417 --> 24:33.271
How? Medicaid?

24:33.304 --> 24:34.629
Um, no, no, no.

24:34.630 --> 24:36.644
The pharmacist actually owed me a favor,

24:36.645 --> 24:38.980
uh, so he gave me samples
from the drug company.

24:38.981 --> 24:41.152
They were... they were free
to the hospital, actually,

24:41.153 --> 24:43.316
so, um, you know, they're... they're free.

24:43.570 --> 24:47.504
That's unbelievable.

24:50.584 --> 24:52.727
Hey, you... you okay?

24:52.760 --> 24:55.382
Yeah. Um...

24:55.417 --> 24:58.678
I'm not... I'm just not
used to people helping me.

24:58.712 --> 25:02.102
It's nice to have someone
else care for a change.

25:03.155 --> 25:05.111
His father...

25:05.144 --> 25:07.222
I am... I'm sorry. I shouldn't, um...

25:07.256 --> 25:10.007
No, no, no. Um, what?

25:11.896 --> 25:14.855
Marcus' dad, he... he bailed

25:14.856 --> 25:16.942
when he saw how hard it
was to take care of him.

25:17.151 --> 25:19.734
He always treated him like
he was some sort of cripple.

25:19.769 --> 25:25.590
And my kid... he does
not need pity and tears.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.314
He needs love.

25:27.782 --> 25:31.158
Well, it sounds like
he gets plenty of that.

25:32.654 --> 25:34.171
He does.

25:35.019 --> 25:36.427
Anyway...

25:39.328 --> 25:40.328
Thank you.

25:40.667 --> 25:41.667
Yeah.

25:42.137 --> 25:43.232
Yeah.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.447
This patch is cobalt.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.007
This one is silicone.

25:53.097 --> 25:55.207
You holding up okay?

25:55.241 --> 25:57.600
We haven't had a chance
to talk about the shooting.

25:58.811 --> 26:00.199
Yeah.

26:01.472 --> 26:03.271
Honestly...

26:03.738 --> 26:07.890
Tonight was... just a lot.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.774
Life's just so out of our control.

26:10.918 --> 26:14.022
Just one accident, one moment,

26:14.476 --> 26:16.775
- one piece of news.
- Yeah.

26:17.126 --> 26:18.630
And that's why I'm just... I mean,

26:18.631 --> 26:20.836
I'm trying to live life in the moment,

26:21.519 --> 26:24.192
especially after Rick's
accident and the breakup.

26:24.468 --> 26:26.351
I'm just trying to take
all the hits and bumps,

26:26.386 --> 26:28.748
go for a ride, hope for the best.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.194
'Cause, I mean, like you said,

26:31.195 --> 26:32.921
it's just out of our control.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.689
Drew, look at that patch.

26:39.917 --> 26:41.245
He's allergic to cobalt.

26:41.263 --> 26:42.344
Yeah.

26:42.353 --> 26:44.062
Okay. Now we just got
to find a manufacturer

26:44.086 --> 26:45.566
who makes a pacemaker without cobalt.

26:46.109 --> 26:48.213
Can you start making some phone
calls? I want to go check on Gina.

26:48.223 --> 26:49.691
Of course, of course.
I'll get Ragosa to help.

26:49.705 --> 26:50.705
- You go.
- Thank you.

26:53.966 --> 26:55.380
So, Doc, I know I said I'm taken,

26:55.395 --> 26:57.021
but, uh, my girlfriend and
I have been talking about

26:57.039 --> 26:59.209
having one of those open relationships.

26:59.324 --> 27:00.324
Uh-huh.

27:00.442 --> 27:02.442
You know, where you can
have sex with other people.

27:03.139 --> 27:03.871
Okay.

27:03.933 --> 27:05.112
Because after a while, let's be honest,

27:05.119 --> 27:06.840
it gets pretty boring doing the same old...

27:06.884 --> 27:09.598
You have to be quiet now,
or the scan won't work.

27:09.874 --> 27:10.874
Copy that.

27:13.593 --> 27:15.934
Okay, don't run the scan,
and don't tell anyone,

27:15.952 --> 27:17.905
and I will get you the
next three weekends off.

27:18.050 --> 27:19.132
- Deal.
- All right.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.014
Catch you later.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.317
Maybe this is mental illness.

27:25.741 --> 27:27.381
Maybe... maybe we're
trying to find something

27:27.384 --> 27:28.248
that's not there.

27:28.363 --> 27:31.275
Toph, both of our guts told
us it wasn't psychiatric.

27:31.390 --> 27:32.549
Sometimes our guts are wrong.

27:32.556 --> 27:34.363
Sometimes that's just us
trying to fix something

27:34.371 --> 27:35.547
that we know we can't.

27:35.824 --> 27:37.541
Nah, I'm not good with "can't."

27:37.589 --> 27:39.037
"Can't" is part of the job.

27:39.389 --> 27:40.125
Her father said

27:40.147 --> 27:42.127
that she's been to every
psychiatrist in town.

27:42.130 --> 27:44.185
What do we know that they don't?

27:44.816 --> 27:46.061
What did we learn in the war?

27:46.227 --> 27:46.848
Hmm?

27:47.116 --> 27:47.962
To follow your gut.

27:47.992 --> 27:49.313
And what happened when we didn't?

27:49.872 --> 27:51.020
I know, Tee.

27:51.493 --> 27:52.021
Look, Toph.

27:52.382 --> 27:53.382
- What?
- Look.

27:56.982 --> 27:58.198
Purple pee.

27:58.337 --> 27:59.513
Purple pee.

28:00.321 --> 28:02.977
G.I. and neuro symptoms,
diaphragmatic paralysis.

28:02.997 --> 28:05.529
Seizures, skin blisters, menstrual cycle.

28:05.546 --> 28:06.248
- Purple pee!
- Purple pee!

28:06.284 --> 28:07.557
- We got it!
- Yeah!

28:07.993 --> 28:09.075
On short notice?

28:09.190 --> 28:10.288
You really think you can pull that off?

28:10.312 --> 28:11.712
We don't know if we don't try, right?

28:11.736 --> 28:13.130
Hey, look, spread the word, okay?

28:13.182 --> 28:14.182
Roger that.

28:21.808 --> 28:22.808
Hey.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.676
I just got an update from O.R.

28:25.016 --> 28:26.540
Gina's gonna be in there another hour.

28:27.274 --> 28:28.284
But so far, so good.

28:28.771 --> 28:30.451
Man,

28:31.007 --> 28:31.962
the surgeon told me

28:31.989 --> 28:34.629
- that if you didn't order that brain scan...
- That's just my job.

28:36.016 --> 28:37.203
It's gonna be okay.

28:38.436 --> 28:39.899
You're my brother, man.

28:40.115 --> 28:41.115
You really are.

28:41.358 --> 28:42.435
I know.

28:43.798 --> 28:46.304
- Okay, don't get all gay on me now.
- Hey, shut up.

28:46.331 --> 28:48.131
Your wife is gonna
survive. I'm not your type.

28:51.126 --> 28:52.126
Whoo!

28:52.724 --> 28:53.787
Hey, man, I'm sorry about

28:53.794 --> 28:55.376
trying to hook you up with my cousin, too.

28:55.388 --> 28:56.388
It was just...

28:56.854 --> 28:58.030
I should've asked you, you know,

28:58.054 --> 28:59.582
what kind of guys you're into or whatever.

28:59.606 --> 29:00.606
I just...

29:00.967 --> 29:02.203
I saw you were hurting.

29:02.279 --> 29:02.987
I wanted to help.

29:03.261 --> 29:04.261
I know.

29:05.212 --> 29:06.333
But I'm still not over Rick.

29:07.268 --> 29:08.902
And I'm not ready to meet someone else

29:09.017 --> 29:10.351
and pretend to care about

29:10.728 --> 29:13.684
what school they went to or the
names of their sister's kids.

29:14.290 --> 29:15.290
I'm still in that

29:16.054 --> 29:17.580
"this all really sucks" stage.

29:18.263 --> 29:19.263
Man,

29:20.814 --> 29:23.484
that's the same relationship
crap men and women go through.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.512
Yes.

29:25.019 --> 29:26.189
It's called being in love.

29:27.226 --> 29:28.258
Don't be such a moron.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.876
- Please.
- Oh, shut up.

29:35.209 --> 29:36.209
Hey, how you doing?

29:36.837 --> 29:38.504
Hey. Hey, yeah.

29:38.536 --> 29:39.536
It's, uh,

29:39.738 --> 29:42.138
just super-hard to find a
pacemaker that doesn't have cobalt.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.925
No, I mean... I mean, how are you doing?

29:45.989 --> 29:46.989
You, uh...

29:47.646 --> 29:49.036
you had a crazy-scary night.

29:50.377 --> 29:51.801
Yeah, yeah. I just haven't, uh,

29:52.217 --> 29:53.630
had much time to process it yet.

29:54.182 --> 29:55.215
Just been running around.

29:57.211 --> 29:58.341
I just...

29:59.185 --> 30:00.587
I just want you to know that I'm really...

30:00.611 --> 30:02.394
I'm really glad nothing
bad happened to you.

30:02.585 --> 30:03.897
And...

30:04.414 --> 30:06.669
I hope nothing does happen to you. Um...

30:07.499 --> 30:09.415
Look.

30:10.963 --> 30:12.335
I'm your friend.

30:13.215 --> 30:16.276
If you ever want to talk or grab a beer

30:16.543 --> 30:18.771
or whatever, you know, I'm around.

30:21.113 --> 30:22.293
Thanks, Kenny.

30:22.809 --> 30:24.255
And congrats on your promotion.

30:24.267 --> 30:26.027
You're gonna be so great.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.405
- Damn Skippy.
- Okay.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.159
All right, thank you. Krista, I found it...

30:30.447 --> 30:33.007
gold-coated pacemaker,
Danish manufacturer.

30:33.026 --> 30:35.813
There's a 24-hour warehouse
right here in San Antonio.

30:35.928 --> 30:37.246
Give it up. Boom!

30:37.267 --> 30:38.280
I will be right back.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.185
Hey, Paul,

30:40.581 --> 30:41.528
how's Marcus doing?

30:41.539 --> 30:42.924
Oh, a... a lot better, actually.

30:43.005 --> 30:43.966
Uh, but I'm gonna admit him

30:43.969 --> 30:45.270
so he can continue getting treatments.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.786
So, the aminoglycoside worked?

30:47.204 --> 30:47.786
Uh, yeah.

30:48.140 --> 30:48.723
- Good.
- Yeah.

30:48.752 --> 30:49.755
Sometimes that works.

30:50.809 --> 30:52.451
<i>Dr.
Alexander to radiology.</i>

30:52.452 --> 30:55.163
<i>Dr. Alexander to radiology.</i>

31:08.850 --> 31:10.546
So, I heard surgery went great.

31:10.690 --> 31:11.808
I've had better days.

31:11.857 --> 31:13.157
But my kids are gonna love this look.

31:13.181 --> 31:14.269
They're gonna call me "mummy."

31:14.293 --> 31:15.994
Oh, good, we're making puns.

31:16.323 --> 31:18.002
I've been getting
a bunch of texts, man.

31:18.026 --> 31:19.794
You're gonna get a commendation
for what you did tonight.

31:19.818 --> 31:20.968
And you're a star, Drew.

31:21.033 --> 31:22.087
You're all over the Internet.

31:22.111 --> 31:22.632
Yeah.

31:22.861 --> 31:24.382
- Show him the video.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:24.478 --> 31:25.179
What video?

31:25.213 --> 31:26.213
It's so cool.

31:26.579 --> 31:29.795
Your 15 minutes of fame have started, bro.

31:30.988 --> 31:33.348
It already has 350,000 views.

31:34.349 --> 31:35.575
It's pretty amazing.

31:35.709 --> 31:36.709
Crazy, right?

31:39.458 --> 31:40.989
So, Amanda has porphyria.

31:41.015 --> 31:43.111
It's a disorder that results
from a buildup of molecules

31:43.121 --> 31:45.122
called porphyrins, in the red blood cells.

31:45.309 --> 31:47.996
Okay, so, you're saying
that you think this por...

31:48.195 --> 31:50.337
disorder is causing this mental...?

31:50.397 --> 31:50.766
Yeah.

31:50.778 --> 31:53.002
Now, it's easily treatable
by a high-glucose I.V.

31:53.287 --> 31:54.810
And a medication called Hematin,

31:54.814 --> 31:56.394
which should work relatively fast.

31:56.809 --> 31:57.745
Okay.

31:57.768 --> 31:59.164
- Hold on one second.
- Hold on.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.606
Let me check a neuro exam.

32:00.622 --> 32:02.430
You said the scan was fine.
I'm not doing any more tests.

32:02.446 --> 32:03.597
I need to bring this woman in now.

32:03.614 --> 32:04.686
Miss, I'm gonna read you your rights.

32:04.695 --> 32:06.404
Hey, just wait. It's not a mental illness.

32:06.408 --> 32:08.138
She's not dangerous. She
doesn't have to go to jail.

32:08.158 --> 32:09.992
- You're sure about this diagnosis, right?
- Toph?

32:10.016 --> 32:11.818
No, no! I'm not a guinea pig!

32:12.014 --> 32:13.955
You can't do experiments on me!

32:13.987 --> 32:15.663
Oh, my God! She pulled out her I.V.

32:15.681 --> 32:16.901
I'll place an E.J. Hold her down.

32:16.925 --> 32:18.128
Aah!

32:22.174 --> 32:23.174
Okay, the med's all in.

32:23.547 --> 32:24.360
Amanda,

32:24.475 --> 32:25.217
can you say something?

32:25.436 --> 32:26.436
How's your pain? Tell me.

32:26.717 --> 32:27.717
Better.

32:28.243 --> 32:29.243
A lot better.

32:29.340 --> 32:29.868
Okay.

32:29.983 --> 32:32.229
Daddy, the pain's going away.

32:32.301 --> 32:33.301
Oh, God.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.819
She's like "The Exorcist."

32:36.623 --> 32:37.338
Is this for real?

32:37.638 --> 32:38.139
Very.

32:38.528 --> 32:39.809
And she's only gonna get better.

32:40.174 --> 32:41.106
I... I won't take her in,

32:41.116 --> 32:42.879
but I am gonna have to give her
a summons to appear in court.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.295
What if we testify for her?

32:44.630 --> 32:45.630
Case might be dismissed.

32:45.720 --> 32:46.920
- Count us in.
- All right.

32:47.517 --> 32:48.210
And, uh, Doc,

32:48.230 --> 32:49.717
think about what I was saying
back there with the, uh...

32:49.721 --> 32:51.081
- Good night, Officer.
- Copy that.

32:52.494 --> 32:53.516
Sounds like you

32:53.551 --> 32:55.134
took one for the team there, Jordan.

32:55.206 --> 32:56.482
Not in the way he wanted to.

32:56.974 --> 32:57.477
Hey.

32:57.761 --> 32:58.808
I'm Dr. Alexander.

32:59.112 --> 33:01.392
- I'm glad to see that you're feeling better.
- Thank you.

33:01.459 --> 33:03.000
So, we're gonna prescribe
you some medication

33:03.005 --> 33:04.602
to keep the disorder in check,

33:04.748 --> 33:06.613
and you're gonna have to
continue the I.V. treatments

33:06.626 --> 33:07.412
for a few days.

33:07.505 --> 33:08.505
And...

33:08.708 --> 33:10.061
no going in the sun, no smoking,

33:10.084 --> 33:11.464
no alcohol, you got that?

33:12.398 --> 33:14.149
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

33:14.264 --> 33:15.264
Yes.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.454
So, you'll only be in the
hospital for a day or two,

33:24.477 --> 33:25.549
but I will, uh, come and visit,

33:25.573 --> 33:27.282
maybe kick your butt in some chess.

33:27.510 --> 33:28.848
- Bring it on.
- Okay.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.653
And, hey, if you ever need
anything while you're here

33:30.665 --> 33:31.756
or even after you're discharged,

33:31.779 --> 33:32.779
just ask for me, okay?

33:32.809 --> 33:33.809
You will skip the line.

33:33.859 --> 33:34.859
Whoa. Really?

33:35.090 --> 33:36.488
V.I.P. treatment.

33:36.957 --> 33:39.566
- What's V.I.P.?
- Uh, that would be very important person,

33:39.766 --> 33:40.598
which you are, so...

33:40.637 --> 33:41.637
I like that.

33:41.890 --> 33:42.283
Yeah.

33:42.398 --> 33:43.398
See you later, bud.

33:44.561 --> 33:45.561
Bye.

33:47.402 --> 33:48.402
That's my number.

33:48.691 --> 33:50.258
I don't usually go for doctors.

33:50.373 --> 33:52.242
Twisted God complexes.

33:53.254 --> 33:55.707
But you are the cutest.

33:57.282 --> 33:58.282
Okay.

34:03.060 --> 34:03.825
Here it is.

34:03.836 --> 34:05.027
Oh, way to go, Michael.

34:05.060 --> 34:06.535
The colonel's already
upstairs getting prepped.

34:06.555 --> 34:07.595
- I'll run this up.
- Okay.

34:09.096 --> 34:10.284
Way to go on the pacemaker.

34:10.929 --> 34:11.465
Well,

34:11.844 --> 34:13.436
at least I got one thing right tonight.

34:14.029 --> 34:16.685
Okay, enough of this pity party out of you.

34:17.463 --> 34:19.710
Look, we're all going to dinner later, and

34:20.514 --> 34:21.514
you should come.

34:22.135 --> 34:23.135
I'm buying.

34:23.969 --> 34:24.731
Well,

34:24.925 --> 34:26.630
if you're buying, I am in.

34:26.900 --> 34:27.449
Good.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.516
But I am gonna go home
and get some rest first.

34:29.862 --> 34:30.678
It's been a long night.

34:30.743 --> 34:32.128
- Text me where later.
- Sure.

34:37.649 --> 34:39.289
Okay, everybody gather 'round.

34:39.514 --> 34:41.106
Listen up, we don't have a lot of time.

34:41.165 --> 34:44.152
I know you have all heard about
this from either Kenny or me,

34:44.190 --> 34:45.665
and you all have your assignments,

34:45.676 --> 34:47.552
so we really need to pull together

34:47.565 --> 34:48.886
to make this happen, okay?

34:49.350 --> 34:50.121
Are you all with me?

34:50.203 --> 34:51.098
Yes.

34:51.101 --> 34:52.395
Okay, come on. You can do better than that.

34:52.418 --> 34:53.250
Yes.!

34:53.327 --> 34:54.704
All right, guys. Thank you.

34:54.723 --> 34:59.632
* Hey, if you could
just put yourself aside *

34:59.709 --> 35:02.081
* For once in your life *

35:02.566 --> 35:05.329
* Oh, won't you try *

35:05.706 --> 35:10.497
* I know that it don't come so easily *

35:10.835 --> 35:12.473
* So put on your pride *

35:12.517 --> 35:13.517
Wow.

35:14.774 --> 35:15.774
You did this?

35:15.845 --> 35:17.281
Jordan... it was her idea.

35:17.623 --> 35:19.135
Michael, you've always been there for me,

35:19.153 --> 35:21.854
and now we're all here for you.

35:22.543 --> 35:23.583
You're part of the family.

35:26.628 --> 35:27.058
Thank you.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.008
* Light, light, light, light *

35:29.366 --> 35:30.366
My lady.

35:31.384 --> 35:32.674
Happy Birthday, sweetheart.

35:33.210 --> 35:35.330
This isn't what I planned,
but it's still pretty cool.

35:35.494 --> 35:38.733
- I got to ride a motorcycle.
- I see, I see.

35:38.796 --> 35:40.434
Uh-huh. Well,

35:40.461 --> 35:41.623
I hope you enjoyed it

35:41.738 --> 35:43.261
'cause it's the last time you will.

35:45.278 --> 35:47.451
I'm not gonna say I'm
not still mad you, Michael,

35:47.465 --> 35:49.656
but you have some amazing friends.

35:49.678 --> 35:50.678
Yeah.

35:50.767 --> 35:52.803
All right, everybody, what
do you say we go inside

35:52.815 --> 35:54.456
and get this party started? How about it?

35:54.908 --> 35:57.064
Um, Michael and Naomi,
you have a wardrobe change.

35:57.097 --> 35:58.160
- You did?
- I did.

36:03.789 --> 36:06.594
Really looking forward to the dance.

36:07.265 --> 36:08.265
Me too.

36:08.310 --> 36:09.310
Smells like beer here.

36:09.331 --> 36:10.513
Yes, it does.

36:12.139 --> 36:14.739
Hey, uh, no fighting
with mom tonight, okay?

36:16.445 --> 36:17.445
Nope.

36:17.723 --> 36:18.723
I promise you.

36:19.725 --> 36:22.266
I won't make any promises
anymore that I can't keep.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.056
* Well, I guess... *

36:24.080 --> 36:26.300
What you did for Ragosa
was pretty fantastic.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.320
He just had a tough year, you know.

36:28.664 --> 36:29.664
He needed a win.

36:29.966 --> 36:30.981
*... make me feel this way *

36:31.005 --> 36:33.170
Parenthood is gonna be pretty complicated.

36:33.211 --> 36:34.340
Pssh. Yeah.

36:34.944 --> 36:36.326
Yeah, we're gonna make mistakes,

36:36.338 --> 36:37.884
but it's part of the adventure, right?

36:37.925 --> 36:40.336
Oh. Yeah.

36:41.044 --> 36:42.122
Here we go.

36:44.250 --> 36:45.395
Nice!

36:52.500 --> 36:53.500
Hey.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.467
There you are. I thought we were gonna

36:55.470 --> 36:57.218
- make some money betting at darts.
- Yeah.

36:57.964 --> 36:59.817
Yeah, you know, it's just, uh...

37:01.809 --> 37:03.486
It's a lot of happiness in there.

37:04.964 --> 37:05.964
What's that?

37:06.062 --> 37:07.490
My breast-cancer-gene test.

37:08.994 --> 37:09.604
What did it say?

37:09.644 --> 37:10.833
I haven't opened it yet.

37:11.248 --> 37:12.313
Just been too scared.

37:12.502 --> 37:13.502
I can imagine.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.265
I mean, I can't, but...

37:16.290 --> 37:17.531
What we talked about earlier...

37:18.196 --> 37:19.877
you can't control what's in that envelope,

37:20.735 --> 37:21.937
but you can control

37:22.161 --> 37:23.361
what you do when you find out.

37:24.554 --> 37:25.754
You'll be there for me, right?

37:28.110 --> 37:29.426
Every step of the way?

37:29.861 --> 37:30.875
Every single one of them.

37:32.997 --> 37:33.997
Okay.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.720
Come on.

37:39.077 --> 37:40.077
Oh...

37:41.775 --> 37:42.775
What?

37:47.195 --> 37:48.195
Oh, it's negative.

37:48.276 --> 37:50.418
It's negative. Holy...

37:51.509 --> 37:53.467
Oh, my God.

37:53.502 --> 37:55.040
Oh, my God. I love you.

37:55.281 --> 37:56.754
I love you, too.

37:57.907 --> 38:00.488
* Hey, mmm *

38:01.123 --> 38:02.189
Great tunes, man.

38:02.304 --> 38:03.442
Brought you a beer.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.013
Congratulations on your new job.

38:06.128 --> 38:07.287
- Thanks, bud.
- Yeah.

38:07.348 --> 38:08.796
* Did you know that I felt this way *

38:08.820 --> 38:10.289
Hey, did you know part of my new job

38:10.318 --> 38:11.718
is to do an end-of-shift checklist?

38:12.154 --> 38:13.068
And one of the things

38:13.083 --> 38:14.325
that I check is the

38:14.527 --> 38:16.125
new pharmacy tracking records.

38:17.074 --> 38:18.074
Oh, yeah?

38:18.100 --> 38:19.100
Yeah.

38:20.528 --> 38:21.727
And according to those records,

38:21.731 --> 38:24.860
I took out nebulized
antibiotics at 4:47 A.M.

38:26.385 --> 38:27.385
Except I didn't.

38:27.909 --> 38:30.339
* And I'm gonna tell you from my soul *

38:31.058 --> 38:31.609
Kenny.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.429
Wow. Oh!

38:33.912 --> 38:36.284
* And I'm through with you *

38:36.618 --> 38:37.618
You really did that?

38:38.655 --> 38:39.994
Y... you stole my badge?

38:40.075 --> 38:41.223
I didn't steal it, okay.

38:41.281 --> 38:42.471
- You stole my...
- I... I borrowed it.

38:42.495 --> 38:43.495
I borrowed it.

38:44.133 --> 38:46.168
And, look, I'm sorry, okay?

38:46.718 --> 38:48.211
I... I didn't think about the tracking.

38:48.235 --> 38:48.672
I...

38:49.144 --> 38:50.033
I was trying to help Marcus, okay?

38:50.040 --> 38:50.910
He needed medicine,

38:50.920 --> 38:52.659
and he couldn't get it
because of some stupid rule.

38:52.683 --> 38:53.689
Hey, hey. Man, look.

38:54.005 --> 38:55.606
Look, I'm all for Marcus, you know that.

38:55.915 --> 38:56.794
But you didn't even ask me.

38:56.801 --> 38:57.572
You just took it.

38:57.767 --> 38:58.826
* Yeah *

38:59.110 --> 39:00.480
You... you put my job at risk...

39:00.487 --> 39:02.555
man, my new job of one day.

39:02.612 --> 39:04.407
* Oooh *

39:07.522 --> 39:08.522
Now,

39:09.063 --> 39:10.504
I'm gonna take the heat on this one.

39:11.175 --> 39:13.018
All right, I'll... I'll
say, uh... say I messed up,

39:13.042 --> 39:15.092
put the wrong order I
or something like that.

39:15.710 --> 39:17.744
But this is the first
and last time I do that.

39:18.004 --> 39:19.004
Got it?

39:20.877 --> 39:21.877
Okay.

39:23.748 --> 39:24.748
I'm sorry.

39:25.228 --> 39:26.228
Never again.

39:27.434 --> 39:28.914
Watch out, man. I got to get to work.

39:29.525 --> 39:31.045
Got to change the mood up in here.

39:33.566 --> 39:35.447
All right, party people,
here we go, here we go.

39:36.422 --> 39:40.005
One more time y'all for the Night Shift!
