WEBVTT

03:02.057 --> 03:04.016
She looks at me every day.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.977
Mary jane Watson.

03:06.144 --> 03:10.189
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.149
But she can never know.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.778
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.239
A life she can never be a part of.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.699
Who am I?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.451
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.621
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.373
Parker. Parker!

03:27.833 --> 03:29.792
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

03:31.211 --> 03:33.880
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.966
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.427
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.388
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.142
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

03:46.310 --> 03:49.186
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.315
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

03:52.482 --> 03:55.151
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.696
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

03:58.864 --> 04:02.617
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.827
This is your last chance.

04:04.995 --> 04:09.749
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.336
Go!

04:35.609 --> 04:37.193
Hey, what, are you stupid?

04:59.132 --> 05:02.301
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.603
I'm gonna get it!

05:28.245 --> 05:30.579
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.998
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.958
See you.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.419
Way to go, Spidey!

06:29.306 --> 06:31.182
Pizza time.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.521
You're late.

06:38.482 --> 06:39.815
I'm not paying for those.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.835
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

07:03.673 --> 07:08.177
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.805
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.474
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.185
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.610
You're fired.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.946
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.614
Dogs catching Frisbees?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.116
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.493
- Boss.
- Not now.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.412
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.499
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

07:38.667 --> 07:42.086
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!

07:42.254 --> 07:44.839
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.757
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.509
You turned the whole city
against him.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.177
A fact I'm very proud of.

07:50.345 --> 07:54.139
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.643
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.146
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.358
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.235
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.113
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

08:09.281 --> 08:11.156
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

08:11.324 --> 08:13.659
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.661
All right, Mr. Jameson.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.540
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.333
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

08:21.501 --> 08:23.085
I told you, he's not a menace.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.837
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.672
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.340
That's outrageous.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.467
Done. Give this to the girl.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.844
Thank you. Bye-bye.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.804
Hi.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.472
Hey, Pete.

08:38.434 --> 08:42.270
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.565
- Right.
- Sorry.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.026
Hey.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.069
Chin up, okay?

09:02.208 --> 09:03.667
Watch it, jerk!

09:14.387 --> 09:16.305
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.015
Where were you headed, Parker?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.475
To your class.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.477
My class is over.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.854
See me standing here?

09:24.022 --> 09:27.816
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.318
Then be here.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.154
Look at you, Peter.

09:32.697 --> 09:37.034
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.079
You always appear exhausted.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.582
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.919
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.255
Planning is not a major
at this university.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.594
Octavius is a friend of mine.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.930
Better do your research, Parker.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.433
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.957
Surprise!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.042
Well, say something.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.460
What's the occasion?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.213
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

10:31.756 --> 10:34.550
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

10:34.926 --> 10:38.220
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

10:38.388 --> 10:40.305
- Hi, M.j.
- Hi.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.182
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.600
Long time, no see.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.646
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.481
It's going fine. It's going good.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.941
She's brilliant in it.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.776
Harry sent me roses.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.487
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.824
I've been busy.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.578
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

11:02.746 --> 11:04.705
The less you see of that man,
the better.

11:04.873 --> 11:08.333
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.793
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.087
So how are things going at Oscorp?

11:12.255 --> 11:15.132
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.509
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.805
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.265
Thank you.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.436
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.022
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.482
You'd introduce me?

11:31.649 --> 11:34.860
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

11:35.028 --> 11:37.029
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.156
M.j., could you give me a hand?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.118
She's waiting for you, pal.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.037
What do you mean?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.706
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.625
However you want to look at it.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.127
I don't have time for girls right now.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.629
Why, are you dead?

11:53.797 --> 11:55.297
I've been kind of busy.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.174
Taking pictures of your friend?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.177
Could we get off that subject?

12:00.678 --> 12:03.680
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.474
Then be honest with me.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.352
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.460
May.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.170
Oh, what, Ben?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.465
Wait.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.092
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

12:40.510 --> 12:45.722
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.852
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.979
Did they have a good time?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.730
I'm sure they did.

12:55.567 --> 12:59.403
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

13:00.029 --> 13:05.200
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.161
I'm worried about you.

13:07.579 --> 13:12.541
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.169
Oh, my. You did?

13:15.670 --> 13:17.004
Oh, well.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.589
So?

13:19.174 --> 13:20.841
I'm a little behind.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.552
Everybody is.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.222
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

13:27.390 --> 13:31.101
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.397
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.399
You need it more than I do.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.068
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

13:40.236 --> 13:42.279
You can take this money from me.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.199
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

13:45.366 --> 13:47.868
And don't you dare leave it here.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.953
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.708
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

13:56.836 --> 14:01.757
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

14:04.093 --> 14:06.303
I think to myself at times...

14:07.472 --> 14:11.767
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

14:12.810 --> 14:14.853
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.986
Now...

14:24.906 --> 14:27.616
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.840
Hey.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.176
Hey. You're still here.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.929
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.391
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.645
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.692
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.696
Oh, boy, yeah.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.282
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

15:13.788 --> 15:15.455
Nothing.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.670
Do you want to say something?

15:27.677 --> 15:29.261
I...

15:35.184 --> 15:36.476
...was...

15:37.478 --> 15:40.731
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.908
You're such a mystery.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.962
Peter.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.882
What?

16:11.888 --> 16:13.597
Happy birthday.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.441
I'm seeing somebody now.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.444
You mean, like a boyfriend?

16:27.612 --> 16:30.280
Well, like I like him.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.826
What?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.245
Nothing.

16:38.081 --> 16:41.333
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

16:43.044 --> 16:44.711
May be more than that.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.380
More?

16:48.091 --> 16:49.549
I don't know.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.095
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.101
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.770
Don't disappoint me.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.897
I won't.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.622
Rent.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.128
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

17:27.296 --> 17:28.797
Can I spend it?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.466
I have a paycheck due this week
and...

17:31.634 --> 17:34.970
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...

17:35.263 --> 17:38.640
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.728
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All
I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.939
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

17:46.107 --> 17:50.986
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.532
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.955
Hello?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.048
Rent?

18:58.137 --> 19:00.513
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.559
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.519
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.480
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.940
Who do we have here?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.858
This is my good friend
I called you about.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.693
He got me through
high-school science.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.863
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

19:17.031 --> 19:18.448
I know what you're doing here...

19:18.616 --> 19:20.909
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.703
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

19:23.871 --> 19:26.206
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.751
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

19:29.919 --> 19:34.506
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

19:37.218 --> 19:38.718
Interesting fellow, your friend.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.012
I won't take much of your time.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.558
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.436
He also tells me you're lazy.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.689
I'm trying to do better.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.442
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.946
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.282
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.908
You want to try it back there?

20:02.743 --> 20:04.286
So is that it?

20:04.453 --> 20:08.873
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

20:09.292 --> 20:12.168
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.712
Sympathetic frequencies.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.922
Harmonic reinforcement?

20:16.257 --> 20:17.966
Go on.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.095
An exponential increase
in energy output.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.930
A huge amount of energy.

20:24.098 --> 20:28.268
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.646
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?

20:31.814 --> 20:35.150
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

20:35.818 --> 20:37.652
This is my life's work.

20:37.945 --> 20:41.156
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.616
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.162
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.164
You can sleep soundly tonight.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.041
Otto's done his homework.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.336
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.005
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.341
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.135
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

21:02.303 --> 21:04.429
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.891
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

21:08.059 --> 21:10.560
Rosie, I love this boy.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.522
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

21:15.566 --> 21:17.150
Well...

21:18.235 --> 21:19.652
I don't really know.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.906
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

21:23.157 --> 21:26.117
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.203
Love should never be a secret.

21:28.371 --> 21:31.623
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

21:32.375 --> 21:34.000
...gonna make you sick.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.419
I finally got lucky in love.

21:36.587 --> 21:37.921
We both did.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.800
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.678
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

21:45.846 --> 21:49.099
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.435
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.105
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.358
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.734
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

21:59.902 --> 22:03.446
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.951
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.619
Poetry.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.288
Never fails.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.838
<i>A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie</i>

22:20.005 --> 22:22.382
<i>Brightest green were all her garments</i>

22:22.550 --> 22:24.926
<i>And her hair was like the sunshine</i>

22:25.302 --> 22:27.971
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

23:25.196 --> 23:26.863
Rent!

23:28.741 --> 23:30.450
Where is my money?!

23:56.101 --> 23:58.394
You seem jittery tonight.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.230
You never know who's coming.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.665
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.183
How'd you do that?

24:40.187 --> 24:42.564
Work out, plenty of rest.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.524
You know, eat your green vegetables.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.945
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.116
Come on. Go.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.453
Keep it steady.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.477
It's a web.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.314
Go, Spidey, go!

25:32.323 --> 25:33.656
We got trouble!

25:52.259 --> 25:54.218
Get me down!

25:54.928 --> 25:57.764
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.225
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.519
Then you think we should
forgive them?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.066
Yes.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.068
I mean, no.

26:14.365 --> 26:18.660
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.662
Whatever.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.832
Shoelace.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.005
You might want to...

26:36.387 --> 26:40.515
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

26:40.683 --> 26:44.519
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.022
It helps maintain the illusion.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.819
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.487
But not to come late.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.368
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

27:13.257 --> 27:16.175
<i>♪ A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man ♪</i>

27:16.343 --> 27:19.345
<i>♪ A-does whatever a spider can ♪</i>

27:19.513 --> 27:22.515
<i>♪ A-spins a web, any size ♪</i>

27:22.683 --> 27:25.059
<i>♪ Catches thieves a-just like flies ♪</i>

27:25.227 --> 27:28.479
<i>♪ Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man ♪</i>

27:44.329 --> 27:46.873
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.416
Yeah, I'm sure.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.501
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.378
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.467
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

27:58.760 --> 28:00.094
What are you doing here?

28:15.235 --> 28:16.486
You hungry?

28:16.653 --> 28:17.904
Starved.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.456
What was that?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.671
Okay.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.795
Cool Spidey outfit.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.881
Thanks.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.135
Where'd you get it?

30:05.470 --> 30:06.804
I made it.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.393
Looks uncomfortable.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.896
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.153
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.290
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.376
Hi, M.J.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.835
This is Peter.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.464
I was on my way to your show and...

31:24.800 --> 31:28.219
Well, I was on my bike...

31:31.223 --> 31:32.765
Are you there?

31:35.394 --> 31:38.270
I really was planning on it all day.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.107
And...

31:42.484 --> 31:44.819
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.821
Bingo.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.490
It's amazing, isn't it?

31:50.409 --> 31:53.285
How complicated a simple thing...

31:54.496 --> 31:58.582
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

32:02.379 --> 32:06.340
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

32:07.008 --> 32:10.136
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.846
Your time has expired.

32:12.013 --> 32:16.267
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.028
I wanna tell you the truth.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.615
Here it is.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.285
I'm Spider-Man.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.829
Weird, huh?

32:38.707 --> 32:41.000
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

32:42.127 --> 32:46.797
If my enemies found out about you...

32:49.634 --> 32:52.887
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.729
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.533
Ladies and gentlemen...

33:14.701 --> 33:18.537
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.372
But first, before we start...

33:20.540 --> 33:24.919
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

33:25.337 --> 33:26.837
Because we found the rubber band.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.927
It's a terrible joke.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.845
But thank you for coming.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.430
Today...

33:36.598 --> 33:41.101
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

33:41.436 --> 33:46.607
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

33:47.943 --> 33:51.237
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.914
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

34:02.082 --> 34:05.543
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.254
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

34:52.924 --> 34:57.678
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.098
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

35:01.266 --> 35:05.352
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

35:05.520 --> 35:08.355
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.983
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

35:11.151 --> 35:12.943
...is as advanced as you suggest...

35:13.111 --> 35:15.154
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

35:15.322 --> 35:16.572
How right you are.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.824
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

35:18.992 --> 35:21.368
...to protect
my higher brain function.

35:21.536 --> 35:25.873
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.626
And now on to the main event.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.711
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

35:50.315 --> 35:54.151
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

35:54.319 --> 35:57.446
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

35:58.073 --> 36:02.368
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp lndustries for providing it.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.244
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.593
Ladies and gentlemen...

36:22.263 --> 36:24.098
...fasten your seat belts.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.452
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

36:50.250 --> 36:53.585
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

36:53.753 --> 36:54.962
Thank you.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.089
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.598
The power of the sun...

37:07.225 --> 37:09.351
...in the palm of my hand.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.542
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

37:33.710 --> 37:35.544
It'll soon stabilise!

37:41.217 --> 37:44.136
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.143
We have a containment breach!

37:53.897 --> 37:55.981
Otto, please get back!

37:57.025 --> 37:59.818
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

38:00.195 --> 38:02.821
It will stabilise! It's under control!

38:02.989 --> 38:04.865
I'm in charge here!

38:05.033 --> 38:07.868
It's my money! I'm in con...

38:11.498 --> 38:13.540
This doesn't change anything.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.213
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.881
No!

38:39.818 --> 38:41.401
Rosie!

39:12.016 --> 39:13.267
Watch it.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.643
That was too close.

39:14.811 --> 39:18.897
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.696
I'm ruined.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.867
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.702
He saved your life, sir.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.538
He humiliated me by touching me.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.291
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.376
What was he doing here anyway?

39:55.810 --> 39:58.228
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

39:58.396 --> 40:00.522
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

40:00.690 --> 40:03.275
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.611
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

40:05.778 --> 40:08.739
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

40:08.907 --> 40:11.283
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

40:11.451 --> 40:14.703
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.288
We're ready, doctor.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.418
Anybody here take shop class?

41:04.170 --> 41:06.463
Help me! Help me!

42:17.410 --> 42:20.912
No!

43:12.465 --> 43:15.342
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.677
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.639
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

43:20.807 --> 43:23.809
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

43:24.268 --> 43:28.939
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

43:29.107 --> 43:30.357
Hoffman!

43:32.401 --> 43:33.860
What are we gonna call this guy?

43:34.028 --> 43:36.238
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.989
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

43:38.574 --> 43:40.242
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

43:41.077 --> 43:45.247
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

43:46.040 --> 43:47.749
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

43:47.917 --> 43:51.711
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

43:51.879 --> 43:53.797
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

43:53.965 --> 43:55.632
Get out.

43:56.342 --> 43:57.592
Chief, I found Parker.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.970
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.472
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

44:02.640 --> 44:03.932
I heard Spider-Man was there.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.727
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.229
Chief, the planetarium party.

44:09.397 --> 44:11.064
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

44:11.232 --> 44:12.774
What do you know
about high society?

44:12.942 --> 44:15.277
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.

44:15.444 --> 44:18.864
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.992
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.952
Could you pay me in advance?

44:32.962 --> 44:35.463
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

44:35.631 --> 44:38.258
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.066
My Rosie's dead.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.987
My dream is dead.

45:02.700 --> 45:03.992
And these...

45:05.995 --> 45:09.497
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

45:12.335 --> 45:13.710
...along with me.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.304
Something...

45:25.765 --> 45:27.265
...in my head.

45:30.937 --> 45:32.520
Something talking.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.026
The inhibitor chip!

45:41.405 --> 45:42.989
Gone.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.037
Rebuild.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.125
No.

45:55.336 --> 45:56.753
Peter was right.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.715
I miscalculated.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.349
I couldn't have miscalculated.

46:10.434 --> 46:12.394
It was working, wasn't it?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.692
Yes.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.737
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.198
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

46:26.075 --> 46:27.909
But we need money.

46:29.662 --> 46:30.996
Steal it?

46:31.163 --> 46:32.914
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

46:35.584 --> 46:36.918
That's right.

46:38.838 --> 46:42.090
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.345
We'll do it here.

46:48.097 --> 46:51.391
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

46:51.684 --> 46:54.185
Nothing will stand in our way.

46:54.353 --> 46:55.687
Nothing!

47:01.110 --> 47:03.778
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.697
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

47:05.865 --> 47:08.116
Yes, but I'm afraid...

47:08.284 --> 47:11.369
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

47:11.662 --> 47:15.165
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

47:15.374 --> 47:16.708
You are?

47:21.797 --> 47:25.008
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

47:25.176 --> 47:27.802
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.220
But the fact is...

47:29.388 --> 47:33.725
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

47:34.352 --> 47:35.935
Well...

47:37.688 --> 47:39.522
At least we get the toaster.

47:39.690 --> 47:43.735
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.906
Oh, yes, I see.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.992
Okay.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.164
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

48:13.516 --> 48:14.849
Peter?

48:16.685 --> 48:18.645
Don't leave me.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.856
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

48:22.358 --> 48:23.608
Hold it!

48:24.360 --> 48:27.028
Put your arms up! All of them!

48:50.386 --> 48:51.719
Here's your change!

49:01.605 --> 49:03.148
Oh, no. Come on!

49:16.579 --> 49:18.746
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

49:18.914 --> 49:20.540
Not anymore.

49:50.279 --> 49:52.071
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

49:55.993 --> 49:57.827
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

50:01.749 --> 50:03.500
Wait a second.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.478
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

50:24.271 --> 50:25.522
Easy, now.

50:27.233 --> 50:28.942
Butterfingers.

50:41.205 --> 50:42.497
Look out!

50:44.625 --> 50:46.626
Help me!

50:48.712 --> 50:51.339
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

50:56.554 --> 50:58.471
Hang on!

51:16.198 --> 51:17.615
Help!

51:37.469 --> 51:39.137
Thank you.

51:42.391 --> 51:43.725
Aunt May.

51:43.892 --> 51:46.894
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

51:47.062 --> 51:50.106
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

51:55.654 --> 51:57.280
Come on.

52:01.243 --> 52:03.369
Shame on you.

52:35.694 --> 52:37.320
There you go.

52:38.280 --> 52:41.616
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

52:41.784 --> 52:43.034
We sure showed him.

52:43.202 --> 52:45.036
What do you mean, "we"?

52:49.124 --> 52:51.542
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

53:19.071 --> 53:21.739
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

53:22.741 --> 53:24.617
Penny! Over here!

53:29.998 --> 53:31.541
Leave it.

53:35.587 --> 53:38.089
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

53:38.257 --> 53:39.590
Why? It's a party.

53:39.758 --> 53:42.677
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

53:42.845 --> 53:46.180
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

53:46.598 --> 53:48.224
Not to mention your friend the bug.

53:48.809 --> 53:50.017
Not tonight, Harry.

53:50.185 --> 53:53.730
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24/7.

53:54.189 --> 53:57.525
Parker!

53:58.068 --> 54:01.112
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.281
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

54:03.449 --> 54:05.408
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

54:05.826 --> 54:07.118
Beautiful tie.

54:07.286 --> 54:09.537
Get a shot of us with the DA.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.456
Beautiful dress.

54:11.874 --> 54:14.625
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

54:15.961 --> 54:17.545
Wife.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.799
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

54:21.967 --> 54:25.052
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

54:25.220 --> 54:27.430
...is pleased to present
our guest of honour.

54:27.598 --> 54:31.350
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

54:32.478 --> 54:35.646
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

54:35.814 --> 54:37.648
...Captain John Jameson.

55:22.361 --> 55:23.861
Hi.

55:26.198 --> 55:29.534
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

55:29.701 --> 55:31.953
But there was a disturbance.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.412
I don't know you.

55:35.374 --> 55:39.293
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

55:40.212 --> 55:41.879
I've been reading poetry lately.

55:42.047 --> 55:43.381
Whatever that means.

55:43.882 --> 55:47.385
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

55:47.845 --> 55:50.680
<i>Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...</i>

55:50.848 --> 55:52.723
Don't start.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.977
Can I get you a drink?

55:56.144 --> 55:57.895
I'm with john. He'll get me my drink.

55:58.564 --> 56:00.189
John.

56:00.357 --> 56:04.235
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

56:04.403 --> 56:07.405
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

56:07.573 --> 56:10.074
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.450
Even my father.

56:12.703 --> 56:15.413
He came backstage to borrow cash.

56:17.040 --> 56:21.419
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

56:21.587 --> 56:23.754
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

56:25.424 --> 56:27.008
After all these years...

56:28.302 --> 56:30.928
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

56:56.413 --> 56:59.790
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

56:59.958 --> 57:03.210
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

57:03.378 --> 57:05.463
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

57:05.631 --> 57:07.423
Don't act like you're my friend.

57:08.175 --> 57:10.134
You stole M.j. from me.

57:10.552 --> 57:12.470
You stole my father's love.

57:13.138 --> 57:18.142
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

57:19.353 --> 57:21.604
Huh? Isn't that right?

57:21.772 --> 57:23.564
Huh, brother?

57:34.534 --> 57:37.286
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

57:37.996 --> 57:42.458
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

57:52.970 --> 57:54.428
What a surprise.

57:54.596 --> 57:57.515
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

58:24.584 --> 58:26.919
Oh, no. No!

58:37.931 --> 58:40.099
Why is this happening to me?

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.396
You seem very okay to me.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.482
My diagnosis?

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.442
It's up here.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:20.199
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:24.078
There is one dream where...

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:25.996
...in my dream...

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:28.541
...I'm Spider-Man.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:33.379
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:38.717
So you're Spider-Man.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.094
In my dream.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:44.640
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.561
Somebody else's dream.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.235
What about this friend?

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.738
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.160
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:08.581
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.499
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:12.877
Listen...

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:18.007
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.176
That's why you keep falling.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.597
You always have a choice, Peter.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.517
I have a choice.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.613
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.157
...make me sad.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.619
Can't you understand?

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.622
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:53.500
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.795
...fairness, justice...

01:01:57.505 --> 01:02:02.259
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.347
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:10.017
I can't live your dreams anymore.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:13.020
I want a life of my own.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:15.314
You've been given a gift, Peter.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:19.860
With great power
comes great responsibility.

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:26.158
Take my hand, son.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.048
No, Uncle Ben.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.386
I'm just Peter Parker.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.889
I'm Spider-Man...

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.308
...no more.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:03:03.570
No more.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.745
- You punk!
- Sorry.

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.331
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:46.006
Hurry up!

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:59.478
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:01.522
Someone, please?

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:05.859
.23 electron volts.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.992
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.506
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:30.509
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:32.636
...in a very inexcusable manner.

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:34.972
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.350
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.269
That would be hypocrisy.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:43.730
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:55.909
"I am glad."

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.955
Are you glad to hear it?

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.459
I am glad...

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.086
...to hear it.

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:07.963
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:11.800
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.680
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.891
You could've told me
you were coming.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.393
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.815
You look different.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:32.487
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.489
I do my homework now.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.493
You wanna get some chow mein?

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.037
Peter...

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.080
...I'm getting married.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.838
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.840
And who's the groom?

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.884
You hadn't decided yet.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.430
You think just because
you saw my play...

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.016
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:04.478
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:08.148
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.192
You're too late.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:12.653
Will you think about it?

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.154
Think about what?

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.323
Picking up where we left off.

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:17.824
Where was that?

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:20.494
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.037
I don't think it's that simple.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.498
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.291
You don't understand.

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:29.211
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.213
I'm different.

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.799
Punch me, I bleed.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.557
I have to go.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.900
I'm getting married in a church.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.201
You are different.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:19.261
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.555
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:25.767
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.104
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:32.941
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:37.321
Where the hell did you get that?

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.031
In the garbage.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.615
In the garbage?

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.286
He must've given up.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:49.457
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:53.420
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:58.383
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.636
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.890
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.642
Your wife is still on that line.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.812
Flowers? How much?

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:14.649
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.068
Get plastic.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:18.819
Gotta go, big story.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:33.126
<i>♪ Spider-Man
Spider-Man ♪</i>

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:39.883
<i>♪ Where have you gone to
Spider-Man? ♪</i>

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.643
Come on, man. Get the money.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:53.145
Come on, come on.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.025
Help!

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.197
Come on!

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.956
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:13.291
He was a peaceful man.

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:17.546
And it was all my doing.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:53.915
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.126
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:59.713
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.048
...and he wanted to drive you.

01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:04.926
If only I had stopped him.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:08.555
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.822
I'm responsible.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:30.994
For what?

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:34.206
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.625
But you were at the library.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.793
You were doing your homework.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:42.088
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.549
What do you mean?

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.968
I went someplace else.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.138
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:54.059
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:57.229
...to impress Mary Jane.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.399
It happened so fast.

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:06.404
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.324
The thief...

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.327
...was running towards me.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:16.706
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:19.000
...revenge.

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.504
I let him go.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:27.342
I let him get away.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.016
He wanted a car.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.435
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:41.940
Uncle Ben said no...

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:45.610
...and then he shot him.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:52.867
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:57.581
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.043
And I...

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.549
I held his hand...

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.718
...when he died.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.270
I've tried to tell you so many times.

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:18.953
Just one more little chore.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:27.962
Where are you?

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:34.010
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:36.930
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:38.682
Good night, Bernard.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:33.319
Hello, Harry.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.697
Otto. What do you want?

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:37.866
That precious tritium.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.452
But I need more of it this time.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:46.207
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.130
Hey! Hey!

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:55.300
Stop! Stop! All right!

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:59.471
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:12.567
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:17.322
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.740
How do I find him?

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.743
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:24.162
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.830
Make him tell you where he is.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:32.921
Have it ready.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:38.343
Don't hurt Peter!

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.983
Somebody, help!

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.528
Fire!

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:07.705
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:11.709
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.796
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.549
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.467
Hey, where you going?!

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.031
I'm coming!

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.434
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:12.020
Come on. Come on.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:14.248
Mama.

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.845
You got some guts, kid.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:32.600
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:34.352
Oh, man.

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:40.733
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:44.779
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.454
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.957
What I need?

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.712
What am I supposed to do?

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.053
I shouldn't have without...

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:10.805
...knocking.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:16.978
Come in.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.567
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:28.823
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:32.285
Okay.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:35.788
And a glass of milk?

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.126
That would be nice.

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:44.338
Okay.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.360
Thank you.

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:12.700
You got a message.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.369
It's your aunt.

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.288
Thanks.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:34.555
What's going on?

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:38.559
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:42.396
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:44.023
Why didn't you tell me?

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:47.485
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:51.072
And Henry jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.740
...and I'm giving him $5.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.492
That's Henry Jackson?

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.245
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.998
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.920
Listen, about my last visit...

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:08.464
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:13.219
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:20.476
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:22.603
And I'm proud of you.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:26.065
And I thank you, and I...

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:29.652
I love you, Peter.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:33.447
So very, very much.

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:55.887
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:58.931
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:05.271
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:06.981
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.482
You're getting tall.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:12.778
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:15.990
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:18.242
I used to.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:19.660
Where is he?

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:24.081
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.585
He...

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.131
- ...quit.
- Why?

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.884
Wanted to try other things.

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:36.677
He'll be back, right?

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:39.222
I don't know.

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:43.684
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:45.853
Spider-Man.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:49.899
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:53.819
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:56.030
...saving old girls like me.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:59.992
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.037
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:05.539
...setting examples for all of us.

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:08.376
Everybody loves a hero.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:12.129
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:16.467
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:18.344
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:21.973
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:26.560
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:29.146
...that keeps us honest...

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.482
...gives us strength...

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:33.693
...makes us noble...

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:38.322
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:43.619
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:46.580
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.251
Even our dreams.

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:54.880
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:57.466
...and he wonders where he's gone.

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:00.553
He needs him.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:09.645
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.273
But don't strain yourself.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.108
Okay.

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.046
Strong focus on what I want.

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:08.162
I'm back!

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:29.517
My back.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:58.003
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

01:26:58.547 --> 01:26:59.797
Peter Parker?

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:03.217
Positive.

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:04.677
Thought he was your pal.

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:07.346
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.850
He's just a great big jerk.

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:12.977
The world's full of great big jerks.

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:16.230
You're adorable.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.232
It's just the uniform.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.654
Lean your head back for me.

01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:26.407
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.077
Just put my head back?

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:32.413
Okay.

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:53.017
Wow.

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:55.561
I'm back on the moon.

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:01.692
You up there with me?

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:24.632
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.300
Very.

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:28.052
Thanks for coming.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:30.304
Everything okay?

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.057
You might say so.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:38.145
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:43.275
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:47.571
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:52.826
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.622
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:59.458
I was afraid to trust you.

01:29:01.127 --> 01:29:04.171
But I've been thinking about it...

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:08.008
Listen, there's more for me to say.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.849
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.686
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.188
I'm saying...

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:30.364
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary jane...

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.366
...but I can't.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:39.039
My mind was playing tricks too.

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:46.338
Do you love me, or not?

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:55.014
I...

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:59.560
...don't.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.317
You don't.

01:30:15.869 --> 01:30:17.077
Kiss me.

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:20.789
Kiss you?

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:22.875
I need to know something.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.004
Just one kiss.

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.303
What's happening?

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:28.148
Peter Parker...

01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:30.818
...and the girlfriend.

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.986
What do you want?

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.991
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.828
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:43.163
I don't know where he is.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.250
Find him.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:51.338
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:53.507
If you lay one finger on her...

01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:55.008
You'll do what?

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:12.503
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:14.254
Sorry, jonah.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.840
It's all my fault.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:20.928
I drove Spider-Man away.

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:24.389
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

01:33:25.892 --> 01:33:27.100
Yes.

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:32.105
Spider-Man was a hero.

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.275
I just couldn't see it.

01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:38.278
He was a...

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:41.198
A thief! A criminal!

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.993
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:48.205
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:50.541
I want him strung up by his web!

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.628
I want Spider-Man!

01:34:23.116 --> 01:34:24.491
Where is she?

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:27.244
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

01:35:18.504 --> 01:35:23.967
What the hell?

01:37:24.630 --> 01:37:26.715
You have a train to catch.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.094
Help!

01:37:31.262 --> 01:37:35.640
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.953
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:58.538
Tell everyone to hang on!

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.582
Brace yourselves!

01:38:21.687 --> 01:38:24.022
Any more bright ideas?

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:26.733
I got a few, yeah!

01:38:48.089 --> 01:38:49.881
Whoa, watch out!

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:21.788
We're slowing down.

01:40:26.187 --> 01:40:28.146
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

01:40:29.148 --> 01:40:30.649
Slower. Gently.

01:40:35.905 --> 01:40:37.238
Is he alive?

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:42.243
He's...

01:40:42.411 --> 01:40:43.995
...just a kid.

01:40:45.164 --> 01:40:46.998
No older than my son.

01:41:06.352 --> 01:41:08.144
It's all right.

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:14.401
We found something.

01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:25.829
We won't tell nobody.

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:42.012
It's good to have you back, Spider-Man.

01:42:02.032 --> 01:42:03.867
He's mine!

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:07.412
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

01:42:07.747 --> 01:42:09.080
And me.

01:42:09.707 --> 01:42:11.040
Me too.

01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:17.547
Very well.

01:42:46.577 --> 01:42:48.536
Where do you want him?

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:57.837
And the tritium?

01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:13.812
Yes.

01:43:43.843 --> 01:43:46.970
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.141
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

01:43:52.309 --> 01:43:54.811
I can look into your eyes as you die.

01:43:57.565 --> 01:43:59.107
Pete.

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:01.150
No.

01:44:01.777 --> 01:44:03.152
It can't be.

01:44:09.743 --> 01:44:11.035
Harry.

01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.999
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

01:44:17.334 --> 01:44:21.337
- He's got M.j.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.339
Tritium?

01:44:25.342 --> 01:44:27.343
He's making the machine again.

01:44:28.178 --> 01:44:32.432
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.351
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.354
...you killed my father.

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:47.655
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:51.159
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

01:45:01.754 --> 01:45:06.215
Hey!

01:45:07.593 --> 01:45:09.385
I'm talking to you!

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:13.222
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:15.224
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

01:45:15.392 --> 01:45:17.977
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

01:45:18.938 --> 01:45:20.396
He's not dead.

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:23.274
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

01:45:41.043 --> 01:45:42.377
Surprise.

01:45:46.799 --> 01:45:48.424
As soon as you get free...

01:45:50.594 --> 01:45:54.597
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

01:45:54.765 --> 01:45:57.850
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.353
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.356
Well, I'm not.

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:37.140
Hang on, Mary jane!

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:54.323
Run!

01:47:18.849 --> 01:47:21.184
Let's see you scurry out of this.

01:47:45.042 --> 01:47:47.293
Now what?

01:48:17.407 --> 01:48:19.534
Dr. Octavius.

01:48:22.704 --> 01:48:23.913
We have to shut it down.

01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:26.374
Please tell me how.

01:48:26.542 --> 01:48:27.959
Peter Parker?

01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:33.589
"Brilliant but lazy."

01:48:33.924 --> 01:48:35.299
Look at what's happening.

01:48:36.301 --> 01:48:38.261
We must destroy it.

01:48:43.809 --> 01:48:45.434
I can't destroy it.

01:48:50.691 --> 01:48:52.024
I won't.

01:48:57.614 --> 01:48:59.740
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:05.371
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

01:49:07.082 --> 01:49:08.457
A privilege.

01:49:09.126 --> 01:49:12.211
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

01:49:13.255 --> 01:49:15.131
Don't listen to them.

01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:22.555
It was my dream.

01:49:22.723 --> 01:49:27.226
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:29.896
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:32.398
Even our dreams.

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:40.031
You're right.

01:49:47.456 --> 01:49:49.332
He's right.

01:49:51.043 --> 01:49:52.668
Listen.

01:49:54.838 --> 01:50:02.345
Listen to me now.

01:50:06.058 --> 01:50:09.018
Now, tell me how to stop it.

01:50:10.145 --> 01:50:11.812
It can't be stopped.

01:50:13.190 --> 01:50:15.316
It's self-sustaining now.

01:50:15.484 --> 01:50:17.526
- Think!
- Unless...

01:50:19.112 --> 01:50:20.863
The river.

01:50:22.199 --> 01:50:23.824
Drown it.

01:50:25.786 --> 01:50:27.119
I'll do it.

01:51:12.416 --> 01:51:15.167
No!

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:31.100
Hi.

01:51:31.893 --> 01:51:33.269
This is really heavy.

01:51:57.919 --> 01:51:59.879
M.j.

01:52:00.756 --> 01:52:02.548
In case we die...

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:04.300
You do love me.

01:52:04.843 --> 01:52:06.093
I do.

01:52:07.054 --> 01:52:09.138
Even though you said you didn't.

01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:14.518
I will not die a monster.

01:53:19.835 --> 01:53:21.877
I think I always knew...

01:53:22.963 --> 01:53:24.588
...all this time...

01:53:25.757 --> 01:53:27.550
...who you really were.

01:53:28.176 --> 01:53:30.719
Then you know
why we can't be together.

01:53:31.930 --> 01:53:34.890
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

01:53:36.726 --> 01:53:39.437
I can't let you take that risk.

01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:45.526
I will...

01:53:47.195 --> 01:53:49.447
...always be Spider-Man.

01:53:52.242 --> 01:53:54.702
You and I can never be.

01:54:42.959 --> 01:54:44.960
Mary jane!

01:55:48.066 --> 01:55:49.733
Hello?

01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:07.084
Who's that?

01:56:07.252 --> 01:56:09.211
Son.

01:56:10.297 --> 01:56:11.839
I'm here.

01:56:12.966 --> 01:56:14.592
Dad?

01:56:15.677 --> 01:56:17.886
- I thought you were...
- No.

01:56:18.388 --> 01:56:20.472
I'm alive in you, Harry.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.016
Now it's your turn.

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:26.228
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

01:56:26.605 --> 01:56:28.272
Now make him pay.

01:56:28.565 --> 01:56:30.232
But Pete's my best friend.

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.026
And I'm your father.

01:56:32.986 --> 01:56:34.403
You're weak.

01:56:35.405 --> 01:56:39.742
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:43.662
Now you know the truth about Peter.

01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:46.081
Be strong, Harry.

01:56:47.125 --> 01:56:48.542
Avenge me.

01:56:51.338 --> 01:56:53.380
- Avenge me!
- No!

01:59:18.067 --> 01:59:19.443
Call Deborah.

01:59:19.611 --> 01:59:21.445
The caterer?

01:59:22.447 --> 01:59:24.573
Tell her not to open the caviar.

02:00:05.949 --> 02:00:08.116
Had to do what I had to do.

02:00:09.786 --> 02:00:11.119
Mary jane.

02:00:12.288 --> 02:00:13.539
Peter.

02:00:14.791 --> 02:00:17.209
I can't survive without you.

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.054
You shouldn't be here.

02:00:30.139 --> 02:00:33.225
I know you think we can't be together.

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:37.980
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

02:00:39.274 --> 02:00:40.983
I know there'll be risks.

02:00:41.943 --> 02:00:44.486
But I want to face them with you.

02:00:45.655 --> 02:00:49.032
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.993
...half of ourselves.

02:00:53.454 --> 02:00:55.038
I love you.

02:00:57.333 --> 02:01:00.294
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:05.132
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

02:01:12.181 --> 02:01:15.684
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:23.483
Well, say something.

02:01:25.987 --> 02:01:28.488
Thank you, Mary jane Watson.

02:01:44.672 --> 02:01:46.423
Go get them, tiger.
