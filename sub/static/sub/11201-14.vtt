00:01.167 --> 00:03.533
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:03.703 --> 00:07.002
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention,

00:07.107 --> 00:09.837
a weapon capable of
destroying Ascended beings.

00:10.176 --> 00:13.145
"Here lies Myrrdin,
Archmage of the Round."

00:17.917 --> 00:18.906
He's dead.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.455
We've seen it used to download
information into someone's mind.

00:23.256 --> 00:25.156
- You have Merlin's memories?
- Some of them.

00:25.258 --> 00:28.352
Earth, Atlantis
and the work he did in this lab.

00:31.631 --> 00:32.598
What is that?

00:32.699 --> 00:34.860
First step towards
creating Merlin's weapon.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.495
I have too many thoughts in my head.
I can't concentrate. I get confused.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.436
- You have to fight it.
- I have to let it happen.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.882
Get to the gate! I'll be right behind you.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.654
TEVARIS: He was very persuasive.

01:04.097 --> 01:06.588
"Convert or die."
Yeah, I'd say that's got some bite.

01:06.699 --> 01:10.692
He said nothing of death.
Only salvation and life eternal.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.832
The blessings of the Ori.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.871
He didn't threaten you?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.043
TEVARIS: He spoke of the religion.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.444
Left this book with us
to read and consider.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.180
Said he'd be back today
to hear our answer.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.377
Well, you're not alone.
This is happening all over the galaxy.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.716
Are you saying
this Prior's claims are false?

01:28.822 --> 01:32.087
We're saying that book's got about
as much truth in it as <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

01:32.192 --> 01:34.251
Hey, that's what they want you to think.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.590
- They? They who?
- I do not understand.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.027
It's a book from our planet.

01:38.131 --> 01:40.656
It's very entertaining,
but it is fiction nonetheless.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.734
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.269
Okay, I think we've gotten
a little off point here.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.861
What evidence do you have
to support your position?

01:46.973 --> 01:51.342
Well, we really don't have any,
and we can't tell you what to do.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.538
Obviously, subjugating people
by threatening their lives is wrong,

01:54.647 --> 01:57.582
so if you choose to resist,
we'll do our very best to try to help you.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.879
Not that we can make many promises.

02:00.386 --> 02:03.981
But we've seen a number of villages
just like this one wiped out.

02:04.624 --> 02:08.116
As I have said,
the Prior made no such threat

02:08.228 --> 02:12.790
and spoke upon the positive
merits of Origin as true salvation.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.833
Soft sell, that's a new approach.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.964
VILLAGER: The Prior of Ori returns!

02:19.405 --> 02:20.599
(VILLAGERS MURMURING)

02:20.707 --> 02:23.471
Listen. No matter which way
you're gonna come down on this,

02:23.576 --> 02:27.068
it's probably best if that Prior
doesn't know we're around.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.474
You can hide here.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.430
Welcome back.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.267
PRIOR: Thank you, Tevaris.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.967
Have you contemplated your divine right?

02:56.075 --> 03:00.136
We have, Prior.
We wish to hear more of your wisdom.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.779
It is not my wisdom,
but the wisdom of the ages

03:04.884 --> 03:07.682
passed on to us by the only true gods.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.620
Hallowed are the Ori.

04:23.463 --> 04:27.900
Adria must've done something to him.
I mean, before turning him into a Prior.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.234
You mean she brainwashed him somehow.

04:30.336 --> 04:33.999
Well, Daniel would never willingly become
one of them like that, preach their beliefs.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.665
MITCHELL: He's damn good at it.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.273
Had those people eating out of his hands

04:37.377 --> 04:40.403
without issuing
one tiny little genocidal threat.

04:40.513 --> 04:43.414
That's what makes me think there's
still a part of Daniel in there somewhere.

04:43.516 --> 04:44.676
He's better than all this.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.276
Yes, but we still have to face
the very real possibility

04:48.388 --> 04:50.413
that it's not even really Daniel anymore.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.491
Having Merlin's consciousness
downloaded into his mind

04:52.592 --> 04:54.423
could have overshadowed
Daniel completely,

04:54.527 --> 04:56.825
weakened him to the point
where Adria could do this.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.557
Still, we cannot abandon him.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.165
So, what do we do?

05:01.267 --> 05:05.135
We go get him, try to figure out
what happened, try to undo it.

05:05.405 --> 05:08.306
- Turn him back.
- That's going to be very risky.

05:08.408 --> 05:11.775
Could be exactly what Adria is hoping for.
She might be using him to get to us.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.903
Still, it's Daniel.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.940
- Lf there's any chance.
- We have no choice.

05:22.188 --> 05:25.954
"Aroden then took off the mask
and revealed his face.

05:26.426 --> 05:30.829
"'Your appearance matters not,' he said.
'Only the truth of spirit in your heart."'

05:33.666 --> 05:36.863
Blessed are those that follow
the path to Origin.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.569
(ALL EX CLAIMING)

05:45.511 --> 05:48.412
Hey, what took you guys so long?

05:53.820 --> 05:55.720
- Carter, we got him.
- Great.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.585
Take us into hyperspace.

06:07.166 --> 06:12.229
- I take it the anti-Prior device is working.
- Well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.234
Guys?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.373
Daniel?

06:22.615 --> 06:23.912
What's going on?

06:24.317 --> 06:25.978
We could be asking you.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.218
Okay, this is not necessary.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.315
No offense, but have you
looked in the mirror lately?

06:33.426 --> 06:34.654
I'm not a threat to you.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.594
In case you change your mind,
you should know there is someone

06:37.697 --> 06:42.066
with a finger poised over a button
waiting to beam you out into space.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.160
We had to let this happen.
It's part of the plan.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.972
- I'm sorry. "We"?
- Oh, yeah, myself and Merlin.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.803
Oh. So he's still inside you.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.505
Yeah, you remember back on the planet
when Adria and I were fighting it out?

06:54.614 --> 06:56.309
Yeah, thanks for that, by the way.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.543
Yeah, it's a good thing
you guys got out, too.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.449
She was way too powerful for me,

07:01.954 --> 07:05.549
but I couldn't just let Merlin's weapon
fall into her hands.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.486
I know it's our only chance
of destroying the Ori.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.959
You gave in.

07:11.597 --> 07:12.655
More or less.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.571
Of course, Origin is designed to channel
the energy of its followers to the Ori.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.576
It's that unselfish act of giving
that leads one's soul to salvation,

07:25.678 --> 07:27.612
and ultimately, to Ascension.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.874
This is no great secret.
The <i>Book of Origin</i> says,

07:29.982 --> 07:34.214
"Make yourself one with the path,
and the journey will lead you to eternity."

07:34.320 --> 07:36.811
Were it not for the power
the Ori draw from our belief,

07:36.923 --> 07:39.619
the Ancients would have
wiped them out long ago.

07:39.826 --> 07:40.793
Why?

07:40.893 --> 07:43.384
You know the answer.
You were once Ascended.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.957
Because they won't tolerate
anyone or anything

07:47.066 --> 07:49.660
that doesn't follow their collective rules.

07:49.836 --> 07:53.033
They claim not to interfere,
but they do manipulate.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.935
They use their power
to hoard their knowledge

07:55.041 --> 07:57.839
and prevent those beneath them
from reaching their level.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.378
<i>JACKSON: She seemed to know</i>
<i>everything about me.</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:04.348
<i>She had a tremendous power</i>
<i>of persuasion.</i>

08:05.985 --> 08:10.513
<i>It was almost as if I could hear her voice</i>
<i>inside my head telling me what to believe.</i>

08:10.656 --> 08:15.650
So I let her believe
that she was getting to me, turning me.

08:18.231 --> 08:21.098
- Why?
- Because I needed her to trust me.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.725
And did she? Well, don't get me wrong.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.361
You're not a terrible liar,
but you're nowhere near as good as me.

08:26.472 --> 08:27.939
Who is?

08:28.040 --> 08:31.134
And Adria could see right through me.
So how did you manage to fool her?

08:31.244 --> 08:35.180
I was able to protect Daniel, make Adria
think he had succumbed to her will.

08:35.281 --> 08:37.841
- Merlin?
- It was necessary.

08:49.929 --> 08:54.525
In our time together, I've really come to
see in you what draws Mother's affection.

08:55.601 --> 08:56.761
Affects what?

08:57.470 --> 09:00.837
It's very important to me
that we save her together.

09:03.776 --> 09:05.107
Of course.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.445
I can feel the difference in you.

09:10.116 --> 09:15.019
It's because you've done so much for me,
showing me the true path.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.348
I'm glad.

09:18.591 --> 09:22.527
And there's so much more
I can do for you, and you for me.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.830
So, she trusted you enough
to turn you into a Prior.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.374
- She had to.
- Why, exactly?

10:10.509 --> 10:13.273
Because she knew I was her best chance
of converting Earth.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.346
And me.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.175
Well, that would explain why she wanted
to believe you, not why she had to.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.947
She had Merlin's weapon.
She just didn't know how to finish it.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.681
I thought she knew everything.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.781
She's human.
Her knowledge is still limited.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.359
But Merlin knew how.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.528
It was a quick and easy way
to avoid an all-out war

10:30.630 --> 10:31.995
between the Ori and the Ancients.

10:32.098 --> 10:35.261
She knows the device can be used
to wipe out the Ancients,

10:35.368 --> 10:38.132
so I told her I would finish it for her.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.930
- Did you?
- Not exactly, but close.

10:42.041 --> 10:45.636
I needed to have the rest of my plan
in place before I finished it.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.007
Which is?

10:47.747 --> 10:50.375
- I needed her to make me a Prior.
- Hello.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.214
So I could steal an Ori ship and fly it
through the supergate to the Ori galaxy

10:54.320 --> 10:57.050
with the weapon onboard
and destroy them.

10:57.690 --> 11:01.285
Okay, one small flaw in that plan.

11:01.394 --> 11:04.522
I know. There's a wormhole blocking
the supergate, and that's why I'm here.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.894
I need you guys to shut it down.

11:18.377 --> 11:20.277
He knew he was no match for her,

11:20.379 --> 11:22.973
and he couldn't let Merlin's
unfinished weapon fall into her hands.

11:23.082 --> 11:25.448
So he and Merlin came up with a plan
to fool Adria

11:25.551 --> 11:27.542
into thinking
that he had succumbed to her power.

11:27.653 --> 11:29.450
So he could continue
to work on the weapon

11:29.555 --> 11:33.150
ostensibly, this time,
for her to use against the Ancients.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.283
Merlin?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.285
He says he still has Merlin's
consciousness in his mind.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.762
Merlin even seemed
to be speaking on occasion.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.231
Daniel says that's what protected him
from Adria's influence

11:42.334 --> 11:45.462
and what's allowed him
to convince her to make him a Prior.

11:45.571 --> 11:47.835
Why did he need her to make him a Prior?

11:47.940 --> 11:50.272
So he could steal the Ori ship
with the weapon onboard

11:50.376 --> 11:51.775
and fly it through the supergate.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.074
He wants us to shut down
the incoming wormhole so he can dial out.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.910
Yeah, so he says.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.075
You do not believe
Daniel Jackson is being truthful?

12:00.186 --> 12:01.915
Oh, I want to believe him.

12:02.021 --> 12:04.956
That could be exactly
what they expect of us.

12:05.057 --> 12:08.515
If Adria really did somehow manage
to brainwash Daniel, then...

12:08.627 --> 12:10.891
This whole thing could be
an elaborate plot to get us

12:10.996 --> 12:15.228
to shut down that wormhole so
more Ori ships can come into our galaxy.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.571
So, what do we do?

12:37.056 --> 12:38.023
Fellows.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.194
This is new.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.792
Yeah, it's always something, isn't it?

12:51.904 --> 12:54.236
Got to tell you, though, not your look.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.035
Oh, it is just temporary.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.936
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.342
You see, when Merlin programmed
the Ancient device to download

13:02.448 --> 13:05.508
his consciousness into my brain,
he gave it a time limit.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.449
See, he knew I could only survive
so long with the knowledge

13:07.553 --> 13:11.080
and consciousness of
two distinct people in one mind, so...

13:11.857 --> 13:13.290
And when he goes?

13:13.392 --> 13:14.916
He's genetically programmed
my body and mind

13:15.027 --> 13:18.463
to revert back to the state it was in
before he was downloaded.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.225
- He can do that?
- Yeah, I'm hoping so.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.994
I won't look like this anymore.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.933
I won't have any
of a Prior's special abilities.

13:25.037 --> 13:28.097
Unfortunately, I'll just be
little old me again.

13:28.941 --> 13:29.930
But that's good news.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.840
Yeah, except I won't be able
to fly an Ori ship,

13:32.945 --> 13:37.075
it'll be too late to execute the plan,
and Adria will have Merlin's weapon.

13:37.216 --> 13:39.980
- I thought that wasn't finished yet.
- It's very close.

13:40.085 --> 13:41.950
All the pieces are there.
It just needs to be assembled.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.521
Adria will figure it out.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.682
And just when does your chariot
turn back into a pumpkin?

13:46.792 --> 13:50.387
- I don't have much time. A day or so.
- A day?

13:50.496 --> 13:52.430
Kind of risky
leaving it this late in the game.

13:52.531 --> 13:53.623
Well, I didn't have much choice,

13:53.732 --> 13:56.997
and it took you guys a little longer
to capture me than I planned, so...

13:57.102 --> 13:58.069
Right.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.137
Why do we have to do that again?

14:02.241 --> 14:03.708
Well, I couldn't exactly just come to you.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.175
I think Adria might have
suspected something.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.768
Yes, I see.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.939
Jack, you have to believe me.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.817
Why?

14:12.251 --> 14:13.718
Why? Well, because...

14:13.819 --> 14:16.686
Oh, I don't know, the fate
of the galaxy hangs in the balance.

14:16.789 --> 14:21.658
You know,
that old chestnut's getting a little old.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.125
No, no, that part never gets old.

14:23.229 --> 14:26.130
Now, you have to shut down that
supergate and you have to let me go.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.132
You know how much
I hate being told what to do.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.394
Jack, it's me.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.992
What, that's supposed to convince me?
Look at you.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.129
Have I ever let you down?
No, don't answer that.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.470
Have I ever let you down
when it really mattered?

14:36.575 --> 14:39.043
I don't even know
who I'm really talking to right now!

14:39.144 --> 14:40.805
Not when you were
being tortured by Ba'al,

14:40.913 --> 14:42.744
killed, brought back to life
over and over again.

14:42.848 --> 14:45.976
- I stood by you the whole...
- All right, just stop!

14:46.285 --> 14:48.776
I don't need to be reminded of that.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.750
I've been around
this barbecue a few times.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.189
Just because you know
the stuff Daniel knows

14:54.293 --> 14:57.660
doesn't mean you're him,
doesn't mean you're telling the truth.

14:57.763 --> 15:00.061
I mean, come on, you've got to know
what you're asking me to do.

15:00.165 --> 15:01.132
I do!

15:02.701 --> 15:06.364
You know, there's a bottom line here.
Carter doesn't think it can't be done.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.736
Yes, it can.
A Mark IX beamed directly behind the gate

15:08.841 --> 15:10.502
in the Pegasus Galaxy
will destroy that gate.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.133
The wormhole connection will be broken.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.144
How do you know that?

15:14.280 --> 15:15.713
Hello? Merlin!

15:15.814 --> 15:19.215
- Oh, yes, Merlin!
- Jack, I wish I had proof.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.911
I wish I had a way to convince you,
but I don't.

15:22.021 --> 15:25.650
Now, this was the only choice I had,
and I took it. It's a good plan.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.626
It just happens to hinge on you guys
believing in me, having a little faith.

15:29.728 --> 15:31.719
Now, I thought you, of all people, might.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.058
Why?

15:33.165 --> 15:36.498
You, of all people, should know that
I don't believe anything anybody says,

15:36.602 --> 15:39.628
even if I understand
what they're talking about!

15:40.406 --> 15:42.601
Jack, it's me.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.967
Yeah?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.285
CARTER: He's right, sir.

15:57.389 --> 16:00.381
A Mark IX Gate Buster, beamed
directly behind the event horizon

16:00.492 --> 16:02.983
so the force won't be absorbed
by the active wormhole,

16:03.095 --> 16:06.121
would destroy the gate
and sever the connection.

16:06.732 --> 16:07.699
Yeah,

16:08.667 --> 16:10.532
I should've known that.

16:11.203 --> 16:14.730
- So, do you believe him now?
- I honestly don't know.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.968
Well, unfortunately, I don't think
a polygraph would work in this case.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.808
No, but I'm not worried about that.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.039
See, I think we've got something better.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.014
You know, Teal'c, the longer I'm gone,

16:31.123 --> 16:33.091
the more suspicious
Adria is going to become.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.490
Why were you preaching
to the villagers on that planet?

16:35.594 --> 16:36.652
What?

16:37.329 --> 16:38.853
I told you, I found out
you guys were going to be there,

16:38.964 --> 16:40.898
so I set myself up to be captured.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.865
You misunderstand me, Daniel Jackson.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.835
Why is Adria not suspicious
of your actions?

16:47.539 --> 16:49.837
You attempt to reform
a meaningless planet of people

16:49.942 --> 16:52.069
instead of completing the weapon?

16:52.911 --> 16:56.813
Actually, she was the one who stopped me
before I completed the weapon.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.107
Why?

17:24.676 --> 17:26.837
- I'm almost done.
- I know.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.610
You must stop for now.

17:38.657 --> 17:40.522
You're afraid the Ancients
will take the device away from us

17:40.626 --> 17:41.650
before we can use it.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.593
They've interfered once before
in its creation.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.561
You're using Merlin's knowledge,

17:46.665 --> 17:49.395
knowledge he kept
from when he was Ascended.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.927
But if I don't finish it...

17:52.704 --> 17:53.762
For now,

17:54.606 --> 17:58.474
you must help bring the energy
of more followers into the fold.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.542
The original plan was for the Ori
to convert our whole galaxy

18:01.647 --> 18:04.912
so they could build up their power
enough to attack the Ancients.

18:05.017 --> 18:08.384
But even then, a conflict like that
on that level was going to be costly.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.853
But now they have a weapon
that could destroy all Ascended beings

18:10.956 --> 18:14.016
within the scope of an entire galaxy
in one fell swoop.

18:14.159 --> 18:17.287
They just need to distract the Ancients
long enough so that they can use it.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.694
Engage them in battle
long enough to complete the weapon.

18:19.798 --> 18:22.858
And back off to safety
while Adria detonates it.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.562
If the Ancients perceive
this weapon as a threat,

18:25.671 --> 18:27.730
why not intervene and simply take it now?

18:27.840 --> 18:28.864
I have no idea.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.340
I mean, maybe they want to
give my plan a chance to work.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.809
Either way, the Ori believe
they still need more power

18:33.912 --> 18:36.506
to maximize their chances for success.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.078
More power.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.981
That means they will need
more followers...

18:41.086 --> 18:42.075
Exactly.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.484
Adria's out working hard for the cause,

18:43.589 --> 18:46.524
which leaves me the perfect opportunity
to steal the ship with the weapon on it.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.026
If you guys would just believe
I'm still on your side.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.623
We're running out of time.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.069
I believe Daniel Jackson speaks the truth.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.110
Lot of good it's going to do us.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.885
I'm going to let you tell them yourself
because I don't have a stomach for it.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.285
MITCHELL: That's all right, sir,
General O'Neill filled us in.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.186
The IOA has nixed the whole thing.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.555
No, I don't think you know everything.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.140
You have to understand,

19:38.243 --> 19:41.144
we've considered
all the evidence at our disposal,

19:41.246 --> 19:43.043
but more than that, as difficult as this is,

19:43.148 --> 19:46.015
I feel very strongly
that we have no viable option.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.784
You want to get to the point?

19:51.757 --> 19:55.090
I assure you this may be
the hardest decision I'll ever make,

19:56.562 --> 19:58.257
but I take full responsibility for it.

19:59.631 --> 20:03.158
Based on my recommendation,
the IOA has proposed to the President

20:03.268 --> 20:06.635
that Daniel Jackson's life
be terminated immediately.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.584
JACKSON: So, what the hell is going on?

20:24.022 --> 20:27.082
This and that. You know, the usual.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.921
You'll never believe what's happening
on <i>One Life to Live.</i>

20:29.027 --> 20:31.086
I really hate to press
the issue here, but I do have a deadline.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.185
So do we.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.787
Oh, yes, I know, before I figure out

20:33.899 --> 20:35.924
how to overcome the effects
of the anti-Prior device.

20:36.034 --> 20:37.899
I thought Teal'c believed me.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.130
- Oh, he does.
- Jack?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.540
No, he's on your side, too.

20:43.308 --> 20:48.075
That little weasel man who
somehow represents your government.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.375
Woolsey?

20:50.716 --> 20:54.846
I can't be certain,
but I think he might not like you.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.285
He wants to have me killed, doesn't he?

20:57.522 --> 21:01.253
I'm not sure how serious he is.
He seems quite the prankster to me.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.850
You know, I was afraid of that.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.631
He was the one who argued to keep
Khalek alive and got burned for it.

21:05.631 --> 21:05.995
He was the one who argued to keep
Khalek alive and got burned for it.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.065
Khalek?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.257
It was his highly evolved half-breed son.

21:09.368 --> 21:13.031
Two people died as a result.
It could have been much worse.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.404
Now that you mention it,
that seems to be in play.

21:19.745 --> 21:23.772
But not to worry.
If it comes down to it, I have a plan.

21:25.050 --> 21:29.248
Oh, you have a plan. Great. What is it?

21:32.591 --> 21:33.649
Well,

21:34.760 --> 21:39.891
when I said that I had a plan,
I meant that I have to plan the plan.

21:40.832 --> 21:44.928
So when, or rather, if,
it comes down to it, I will have a plan.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.800
I've cleared my whole afternoon

21:50.208 --> 21:51.470
for planning.

21:53.578 --> 21:55.341
You believe me, right?

21:55.781 --> 21:56.748
Mmm-hmm.

21:59.217 --> 22:02.584
Okay, now I don't believe you.

22:13.765 --> 22:16.131
Imagine our positions were reversed.

22:17.235 --> 22:18.759
What would you do?

22:18.870 --> 22:19.837
Hmm...

22:20.339 --> 22:24.036
I know you've trusted me even when
you've had every reason not to,

22:24.976 --> 22:29.572
but perhaps I'm the only one who knows
how dangerous and powerful Adria is.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.840
There's no evidence.

22:32.384 --> 22:35.615
Only your word,
and that should be enough,

22:36.655 --> 22:38.179
but this is so big.

22:39.157 --> 22:42.422
- Well, I wouldn't let them kill you.
- Of course not.

22:43.995 --> 22:46.225
I won't let that happen to you.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.661
But would you support me,

22:50.435 --> 22:55.566
if what I was proposing could very well
open the door to the final Ori victory?

22:58.510 --> 23:02.708
Not if there was the slightest chance
that I wasn't on the level,

23:03.582 --> 23:06.745
even if it was the tiniest nagging doubt.

23:19.831 --> 23:23.358
That's a load of crap.
You're wasting our time.

23:23.468 --> 23:26.460
Dr. Jackson was the one
who suggested we should kill Khalek.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.436
He was the demon spawn of Anubis.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.737
And Dr. Jackson is now
potentially an even bigger threat.

23:31.843 --> 23:33.834
I think the operative
word there is "potentially".

23:33.945 --> 23:35.913
We don't know exactly
what's going on yet.

23:36.014 --> 23:38.915
And by the time we do, it may be too late.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.382
We know that anti-Prior device

23:40.485 --> 23:42.851
will only subdue his powers
for a limited time.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.388
After that, you won't
be able to control him.

23:45.490 --> 23:49.586
All right, listen to me closely,
because I'm only going to say this once.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.496
You kill Daniel over my dead body.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.931
Obviously, we need to discuss
some realistic options.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.497
We can't hold Dr. Jackson long-term
and we can't release him,

24:01.606 --> 24:03.073
given what he knows.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.309
Well, if he has fallen under their influence,

24:05.410 --> 24:08.811
the Ori likely know everything
they can learn from him already.

24:08.914 --> 24:09.881
What are you suggesting?

24:09.981 --> 24:14.111
Dr. Jackson claims he'll revert
back to his old self in short order.

24:14.719 --> 24:17.483
We only need to hold him long enough
to see if that's true.

24:17.589 --> 24:21.150
If it's not, we still have the option
of placing him in stasis.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.987
If he hasn't already caused
a major catastrophe by then.

24:24.095 --> 24:25.619
Oh, will you stop it?

24:26.264 --> 24:27.526
If he is telling the truth,

24:27.632 --> 24:32.035
then we've blown the best chance
we've ever had of beating the bad guys.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.078
How's it going, sir?

24:41.646 --> 24:44.945
Longing for the days
when I actually carried a weapon.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.382
- What do you got?
- A crazy idea.

24:47.486 --> 24:51.752
I'm down with crazy. I like crazy.
Crazy and I are like that.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.324
Cam likes crazy, too.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.926
Listen, if what Jackson is saying is true,

24:56.027 --> 24:58.723
there is an Ori ship out there
with a near-complete weapon on it

24:58.830 --> 25:01.162
that could prove useful against the Ori.

25:01.733 --> 25:04.566
- I think we should go after it.
- You're right, that's crazy.

25:04.669 --> 25:08.298
I'm just saying, if they're not going
to let Jackson complete his mission,

25:08.406 --> 25:10.306
there is no reason that we shouldn't try.

25:10.408 --> 25:13.036
Daniel Jackson may be able to provide
us with the intelligence required

25:13.144 --> 25:15.203
to ensure the success for this mission.

25:15.313 --> 25:18.111
He might be able to tell us where the ship
is and how to get aboard undetected.

25:18.216 --> 25:20.343
And he must have enough knowledge
of their technology by now

25:20.452 --> 25:21.578
to provide me with what I need

25:21.686 --> 25:24.177
to interface with the ship's
control systems.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.847
Assuming he tells you.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.849
Well, why wouldn't he?

25:29.294 --> 25:31.455
If he knows he's not going anywhere...

25:33.498 --> 25:36.092
- That's crazy.
- That's what I said. It's crazy.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.830
It's nuts. It's wacko.
But let's be honest, what isn't?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.672
Jack, I'm the only one
who should be going.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.172
It's too dangerous for anyone else.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.675
Not if you give me the intel we need.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.039
It's my plan.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.841
It was a bad one. Come on, Daniel,

25:50.582 --> 25:53.710
you had to know we weren't going
to shut down that supergate for you.

25:53.818 --> 25:54.944
We had no choice.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.577
Oh, now it's "we".

25:57.155 --> 26:01.615
You've been in my position before.
Well, not this one, but similar.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.727
Yes, I'm sure I have,

26:04.195 --> 26:07.562
but my brain's been messed with
so much over the years, I don't remember.

26:07.666 --> 26:11.568
Wait a second, with your way,
you still have to shut down the supergate.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.365
Come on, where's the ship?

26:15.640 --> 26:17.505
How does Carter fly it?

26:17.976 --> 26:21.036
And give me any other intel
I might need to make this op a success.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.204
Come on.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.079
I'm trusting you.

26:27.185 --> 26:30.120
Oh, yes, I really feel the faith.

26:30.655 --> 26:32.919
Well, now you have to trust us.

26:34.025 --> 26:36.220
Let us finish what you started.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.922
The Ori ship containing Merlin's weapon

26:42.033 --> 26:43.864
is parked in orbit
around a planet with a gate.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.960
We gate to the planet,
use rings to get aboard.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.129
There is a Prior in charge of the ship

26:47.238 --> 26:49.502
but he preaches to the masses
on the planet daily.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.872
I thought only a Prior
could fly one of their ships.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.604
The systems are activated
using mind control,

26:53.712 --> 26:55.907
but Daniel's given me
what I need to get around it.

26:56.014 --> 26:59.006
He's also given us instructions
on how to put the final pieces together.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.518
<i>Daedalus</i> will be standing by
in Pegasus to shut down the wormhole.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.919
We use the Ori ship to dial out,
and we send the weapon through.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.218
But not before the <i>Odyssey</i> beams us off.

27:07.325 --> 27:09.020
Now, that's a plan.

27:10.261 --> 27:13.321
That depends entirely
on Daniel Jackson's word.

27:13.465 --> 27:17.595
We will know whether he's on the level
before we shut off the supergate.

27:17.702 --> 27:20.398
So at this point, the only thing at risk

27:21.506 --> 27:22.473
is us.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.356
No gun.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.464
Hmm.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.561
Did you bring lethal injection,
high voltage,

27:49.668 --> 27:53.160
or are you just going to have them
beam me out into space?

27:53.271 --> 27:55.205
I think you understand my position.

27:55.306 --> 27:57.467
I gave Jack the information you asked for.

27:57.575 --> 28:00.738
And you will be frozen in stasis
until such time

28:00.845 --> 28:03.678
that SG-1's mission is deemed successful.

28:05.183 --> 28:09.517
I take it then, you're not going to allow me
to just turn back into my old self?

28:09.654 --> 28:11.918
If the intel turns out to be reliable,

28:12.190 --> 28:15.421
you will be unfrozen
and allowed to resume transforming,

28:15.527 --> 28:18.257
if that indeed is going to happen.

28:19.864 --> 28:20.990
I see.

28:30.675 --> 28:32.438
I am here out of respect for you.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.977
I wanted to explain personally

28:34.079 --> 28:37.571
that we're about to beam you
into the Ancient pod in Antarctica.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.613
Okay.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.924
You're clear to beam the prisoner out now.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.327
What's the holdup?

28:58.203 --> 29:01.764
<i>MAN: We're having some technical</i>
<i>problems. We can't seem to get a lock.</i>

29:25.330 --> 29:27.059
Not part of my plan.

29:34.506 --> 29:38.966
I've always been the one
who caused the worry, not the worrier.

29:39.410 --> 29:43.437
It's not easy. Don't second-guess yourself.
This is the best possible course of action.

29:43.548 --> 29:47.177
Exactly. Action, good. Sitting around, bad.

29:47.285 --> 29:51.187
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
I still worry sometimes, too, about you.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.655
- Well, thank you, sir.
- Don't mention it.

29:57.028 --> 30:00.589
I thought we fixed this thing
so that wouldn't happen anymore.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.499
Daniel?

30:11.676 --> 30:12.768
Jack.

30:13.678 --> 30:16.044
- What's up?
- Oh, I'm taking the ship.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.637
Oh. I see that.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.879
Yeah, I beamed the crew safely
to the surface.

30:21.219 --> 30:22.652
Nice for them.

30:23.021 --> 30:26.479
But, as you probably figured out by now,
I'm going to need you.

30:26.791 --> 30:30.557
You know, I was just thinking
how much I missed being needed.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.160
(MEN YELLING)

31:05.563 --> 31:10.091
All right, fellows, here's the deal.
We're commandeering this ship.

31:10.201 --> 31:14.160
I'd like for you to throw down
your weapons and surrender, please.

31:17.308 --> 31:18.673
That's a no.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.380
We asked nicely.

31:51.009 --> 31:52.067
Okay.

31:57.482 --> 31:59.177
This shouldn't be too bad.

31:59.717 --> 32:01.207
I don't know.

32:01.352 --> 32:03.081
For me, whenever there's some
assembly required,

32:03.187 --> 32:07.248
I inevitably find some part missing.
A screw, widget, what have you.

32:07.392 --> 32:08.484
Hmm.

32:09.661 --> 32:13.427
Well, according to Daniel's instructions,
it all seems to be here.

32:13.531 --> 32:15.726
Ah, well, I never follow instructions.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.529
You think that could be
part of the problem?

32:36.421 --> 32:38.355
- We clear?
- For the moment.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.184
Okay, I've locked out the rings
and secured this level.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.191
We shouldn't have any more company.

32:42.293 --> 32:46.286
Hang on, guys. If this works,
we're about to jump into hyperspace.

32:59.544 --> 33:03.105
Yep. Just like old times.

33:06.417 --> 33:11.548
Except I'm here against my will,
and you look like Marcel Marceau.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.216
Yeah, you know, some things change,
but others stay the same.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.622
Very good.

33:16.461 --> 33:20.693
Why'd you bother giving me the intel
if you were going to bust out anyway?

33:24.669 --> 33:26.500
Well, obviously,
I'm improvising at this point.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.333
I had no idea when, or even if,

33:28.439 --> 33:31.340
I was going to be able to overcome
the effects of the anti-Prior device.

33:31.442 --> 33:32.670
Time was running out.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.745
Adria is going to notice my absence
and become suspicious

33:34.846 --> 33:40.045
so sending the rest of SG-1 to get
the device was my only choice at the time.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.312
Then why do this now?

33:42.487 --> 33:43.511
Because I'm afraid the rest of the team

33:43.621 --> 33:46.749
won't be able to complete
the mission without me.

33:46.991 --> 33:49.084
Oh, aren't we full of ourselves?

33:49.193 --> 33:52.060
That, and I wasn't about
to let Woolsey freeze me.

33:52.163 --> 33:54.097
- That I understand.
- Yeah.

34:02.106 --> 34:05.633
Okay, I think that's about it.

34:06.377 --> 34:09.312
Hang on. What's this?

34:09.447 --> 34:11.074
Oh, I'm not sure about that one.

34:11.182 --> 34:14.515
See, there is always a widget left over.

34:14.619 --> 34:16.917
I thought you were always one short.

34:17.088 --> 34:20.216
Well, you'd think both
was impossible, but it's not.

34:20.358 --> 34:21.484
Right.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.390
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's the timing crystal that sets

34:24.495 --> 34:27.987
the detonation of the weapon
five minutes after it's inserted.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.091
Right. Hold on that. Carter, status?

34:31.369 --> 34:34.031
<i>CARTER: Vala, Cam, we're moments</i>
<i>from exiting hyperspace.</i>

34:34.138 --> 34:36.368
Roger that. We're almost done here.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.943
Check that. Vala's almost done.
I still have my doubts.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.721
And that means?

34:51.823 --> 34:54.792
That means the weapon
is ready to be activated.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.120
What?

34:58.229 --> 35:00.697
Oh, I was just wondering
if an Ascended being

35:00.798 --> 35:03.468
was going to swoop down
and take it away.

35:03.801 --> 35:06.895
I guess they don't mind us
doing their dirty work for them.

35:07.004 --> 35:07.971
Or...

35:09.040 --> 35:10.166
Or what?

35:10.408 --> 35:12.569
Or there's no point
because I've assembled it wrongly

35:12.677 --> 35:14.736
and it's not going to work.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.614
- Colonel Carter.
- Yeah, I see it.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.989
Just came up on the ship's sensors.

35:30.361 --> 35:32.261
Cam, Vala.

35:33.431 --> 35:35.194
We have a problem.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.805
What's it doing?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.803
It seems to be just sitting there
blocking our way.

35:44.909 --> 35:47.002
I'm trying to raise shields.

35:50.381 --> 35:51.678
Hi there.

35:54.485 --> 35:58.683
Carter, I thought you sealed off this level
and locked out the rings.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.454
Me, too.

36:16.307 --> 36:19.902
I was afraid of that.
Adria must've anticipated my plan.

36:21.646 --> 36:24.513
- They're going to detect us.
- We're cloaked.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.983
- This ship doesn't have that.
- It does now.

36:28.085 --> 36:29.780
Having a ZPM helps.

36:31.322 --> 36:34.382
When the time comes,
give the order to <i>Daedalus.</i>

36:38.863 --> 36:40.194
We'll see.

36:45.069 --> 36:46.263
I should never have trusted you.

36:46.370 --> 36:50.101
They're about to shut down the supergate
and allow our ships through.

36:50.241 --> 36:53.608
They've assembled the weapon,
and the Ancients didn't interfere.

36:53.711 --> 36:54.803
Right?

36:55.413 --> 36:57.608
You did exactly as I said, right?

36:58.316 --> 37:00.375
Daniel, what are you doing?

37:00.484 --> 37:03.681
We can destroy the Ancients right now,
and the Ori won't even have to fight.

37:03.788 --> 37:05.688
I've done all of this for you.

37:09.627 --> 37:12.095
- Your mind is closed to me.
- Yeah.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.568
- What the hell is going on?
- Sorry about that.

37:20.004 --> 37:22.472
I had to be sure
this was working on her first.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.404
You got past her personal shield.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.942
Yeah, that took a lot.

37:30.748 --> 37:34.309
- Are you all right, Daniel Jackson?
- Yeah, a little dizzy.

37:35.219 --> 37:38.552
Look, I don't have much time left.
Go arm the device.

37:39.991 --> 37:40.980
Jack's onboard <i>Odyssey.</i>

37:41.092 --> 37:43.560
He's going to shut down the gate.
Now, go!

37:56.974 --> 37:58.566
Jack, give the command.

38:01.946 --> 38:05.382
<i>Please.</i>
<i>I'm running out of strength to do this.</i>

38:11.289 --> 38:12.620
<i>Daedalus,</i>

38:13.691 --> 38:15.852
this is General Jack O'Neill.

38:21.699 --> 38:22.859
What's going on?

38:22.967 --> 38:24.764
- Daniel's flying the ship.
- Daniel?

38:24.869 --> 38:26.530
He wishes us to arm the weapon.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.104
General O'Neill's onboard the <i>Odyssey.</i>

38:28.205 --> 38:29.638
- And?
- Do it.

39:38.576 --> 39:39.600
We got to go.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.769
Sir, if you can hear me,
we need to beam out now.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.073
What about Adria?

39:58.763 --> 40:00.390
(MONITORS BEEPING)

40:06.303 --> 40:07.861
Hey, sleepyhead.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.471
What took you so long?

40:12.042 --> 40:14.636
- What happened?
- Nothing. Why?

40:14.879 --> 40:17.939
We armed the weapon, you dialed
the gate and sent the Ori ship through.

40:18.048 --> 40:19.845
Assuming it is you.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.750
No, it's me.

40:25.122 --> 40:28.489
Merlin's gone.
He sacrificed himself for this to work.

40:30.361 --> 40:32.989
Yeah? Prove it.

40:41.505 --> 40:43.996
- What the hell was that?
- Lf I was Merlin, you would know.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.599
- What about Adria?
- Still on the ship.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.609
All right, here's a question.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.504
How do we know it worked?

40:51.615 --> 40:53.242
We don't. Not yet.

40:53.651 --> 40:56.916
I think if it did work,
the Ancients would feel obligated

40:58.055 --> 41:01.821
to give us a fruit basket
or, like, a gift certificate,

41:04.862 --> 41:05.988
or something like that.

41:06.096 --> 41:09.224
Maybe the reason why they let us do it
is because they knew it wouldn't work.

41:09.333 --> 41:12.268
Or maybe because they knew
it would and wanted it to.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.937
There's no point in guessing.

41:14.038 --> 41:17.269
Even if it is successful,
there are still many Priors

41:17.374 --> 41:21.936
with great power and vast armies
of warriors bent on converting this galaxy.

41:22.513 --> 41:25.573
It will be very difficult
to convince them their gods are dead.

41:25.683 --> 41:27.116
If they're dead.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.857
Carter, Sunshine is awake.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.627
- That's good. Is he okay?
<i>- Well, he's grumpy.</i>

41:40.030 --> 41:42.828
Can you ask him
how he managed to cloak the ship?

41:46.770 --> 41:49.671
He said magicians
don't reveal their secrets.

41:49.773 --> 41:52.173
<i>Hey, is that Ori ship</i>
<i>still hanging around out there?</i>

41:52.276 --> 41:53.743
Yeah, it's still out there.

41:53.844 --> 41:57.177
I sent a message to Earth,
telling them that we were going...

41:59.216 --> 42:01.309
Guys, you better get up here.

42:09.393 --> 42:10.951
Incoming wormhole.

42:22.339 --> 42:24.899
Yeah, I think that went well.

42:26.644 --> 42:30.307
We knew eliminating the Ori
might not stop their followers.

42:30.915 --> 42:33.213
I still think it was the right thing to do.

42:33.317 --> 42:36.013
We may have made
things worse right now.

42:36.687 --> 42:40.453
But in the long run,
it could be our only chance to win the war.
