01:07.110 --> 01:09.504
Damon Cleaners Cleansing
House, Body, and Soul,

01:09.547 --> 01:11.767
getting rid of what's haunting
you, that's our goal.

01:11.810 --> 01:12.724
How can I help you?

01:12.768 --> 01:14.248
That's right, hauntings,

01:14.291 --> 01:17.164
demon possessions,
seances gone awry.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.688
Can you describe
the ghoulish noise?

01:19.731 --> 01:24.736
What is like a, "Ooo" or more like,
"Your mother sucks cocks in hell."

01:26.086 --> 01:27.609
Okay, the first one.
Okay, great.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.654
How many times did
you say Bloody Mary?

01:29.698 --> 01:31.656
- Sir, where is the doll now?
- Guesstimate.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.181
- Did the doll ask you to play a game?
- Ooh, okay.

01:34.224 --> 01:37.575
- Do not say yes. - That's a problem.
- Never say yes to a doll's game.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.665
If they said, "We'll be back"
then they'll definitely be back.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.363
You can take that to the bank.

01:42.406 --> 01:45.017
Your wife stares at you
while you're sleeping?

01:45.061 --> 01:47.542
Yeah, that could definitely
be paranormal activity.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.282
Honestly, that's where it
starts most of the time.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.154
Ma'am, put down the Ouija board.

01:51.198 --> 01:54.940
I need you to put it down and do
not ask it any more questions.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.116
Demon Cleaners.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.857
No, we don't do dry cleaning.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.774
- We press shirts?
- No.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.167
No, sorry.

02:10.390 --> 02:11.740
Who the fuck is that?

02:12.784 --> 02:16.179
It's just weird.

02:20.749 --> 02:24.318
No, no, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I know.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.971
I know I shouldn't
have taken the money.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.104
I know, I'm sorry, I fucked up.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.019
I can... I can get it back.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.629
I can get it all back.
I can get it...

02:31.673 --> 02:34.502
Shut up.
Man, you sound annoying.

02:34.545 --> 02:38.462
What I need right now are a couple
of bullets to the back of your head.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.551
No, please,
don't kill me.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.902
If you've seen my face, kid,
you're already dead.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.818
No, no, I can get it back.
I just need... No.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.254
Alright,
please turn off all computers,

02:48.255 --> 02:51.432
laptops, iPads,
iPhones, et cetera.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.782
Have you used any of
these devices in the last hour?

02:55.349 --> 02:57.177
- Great, that's that then.
- Okay, insane.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.742
- It's too late. They're in.
- They're already in.

02:58.743 --> 03:02.443
- It's too late.
- Oh, one is getting angry.

03:02.486 --> 03:03.835
This is stupid.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.446
It's in the boy.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.925
It's in the boy.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.797
- Out, demon.
- Out.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.712
Out of this young man.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.888
Let him go from your grasp.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.890
Oh my God, damn it, Jim.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.891
I told you we should've
taken care of this sooner.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.590
- This may be too late and it probably is.
- It probably is.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.461
Honestly, I don't know if
there's hope for your child.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.246
Quiet, do you hear that?

03:23.290 --> 03:24.900
I don't hear anything.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.815
Zip it, Damien.

03:26.858 --> 03:31.646
Now, this house has a lot
of demonic forces in here, okay?

03:31.689 --> 03:33.213
I need you to close your eyes.

03:34.257 --> 03:37.434
Remember, the eyes
are the gateway to the soul,

03:37.478 --> 03:40.959
do not allow
the ghosts into your gateway.

03:41.003 --> 03:43.832
And these demons will
get in your gateway, people.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.574
Yeah, no peeking
or the, um, the demons

03:46.617 --> 03:48.663
will, you know,
really have at it.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.621
That's right.

04:02.111 --> 04:05.244
- There's something drawing 'em, I can't find it.
- Yeah, I can't find it either.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.117
Alright, listen.
Do you have any silver?

04:08.160 --> 04:10.597
- We have my grandmother's silver.
- Those are priceless antiques.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.120
- There it is.
- Silvers hide, yeah. That's it.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.254
- We give it to 'em.
- It's a magnet

04:14.297 --> 04:15.558
for all the demonic forces.
Where is it at?

04:15.559 --> 04:16.430
It's in the top drawer.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.040
Finally, thank you.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.954
Someone cares
about their family, great.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.130
- Oh, yeah, you hear that?
- Oh, yeah, I hear it. I hear it.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.263
- They don't want me in here.
- Do you have any jewelry? Let me take this

04:24.264 --> 04:25.742
because I feel like
they're hanging on,

04:25.743 --> 04:27.484
they're probably
attracted to that.

04:27.528 --> 04:30.182
Demons can come in
at any time, people.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.141
- Any time.
- We got to go, Mol.

04:32.184 --> 04:35.753
Alright, let's go and you, I
got my eyes on you, Chucky.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.189
My name is Miles.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.235
Sure it is.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.325
Yep, you see what I'm
getting here, Atticus?

04:42.369 --> 04:43.979
It's getting a hot, hot room.

04:44.022 --> 04:48.549
- Yep, a lot of levels here.
- The tapestry. Wow.

04:48.592 --> 04:51.353
- Look at this, this is dropping.
- This house is haunted, I told you.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.118
- Oh, God.
- I was touched by a ghost.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.295
Sexual abuse by a ghost
is very common, ma'am.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.383
That's right.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.819
If we don't catch this ghost,

04:57.862 --> 05:00.082
he will likely
sexually offend again.

05:00.125 --> 05:04.565
- No, you weren't sexually abused by a ghost.
- Blame the victim, you know.

05:04.608 --> 05:09.047
Ma'am, it is not your fault, ghosts are vicious
sexual predators, everyone knows that.

05:09.091 --> 05:12.747
That's right, ma'am. If a ghost
does want to enter to you, he will.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.095
It had nothing to do with
the nightie you were wearing.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.054
Alright,
get the fuck outta here.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.665
Your work is up gone.
It's ended.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.363
It's done. Get out.
Mom, tell them to get out.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.887
You can't register as a sex
offender when you're a ghost.

05:22.931 --> 05:23.974
The government
isn't set up for that.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.195
- Not yet.
- Yeah.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.936
Okay,
we are talking to Congress.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.112
Make your bill count
it's called the Casper law.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.853
Other ghosts don't turn on each other.
They won't rat each other out.

05:32.854 --> 05:35.247
It is like this invisible code,
so it's very hard.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.858
Very hard for someone like you.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.121
Get the fuck out.
Psychopaths, outta here.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.731
We'd like to be done,
but we're not.

05:40.775 --> 05:41.906
We'll go when it does.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.913
Mom.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.091
Mom.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.964
Speak your name,
vicious, sexual ghost.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.619
Begone, overly
sexual poltergeist.

05:58.662 --> 06:03.928
Your reign of elder abuse
ends here and ends now.

06:03.972 --> 06:07.149
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Okay, that's it.

06:07.192 --> 06:10.239
No, get out or
The Power of my Fist Compel You.

06:10.282 --> 06:13.677
- Get these people out of my house.
- Wow.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.940
Then we had this
incident the other night.

06:15.984 --> 06:19.248
It's just been a bizarre,
psycho situation.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.424
- We need your help.
- Mm-hmm.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.121
- I don't know what it is, a ghost, demons, sounds.
- I'm sensing something.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.514
They need to get out,
I can't sleep.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.733
It's not like
anyone got murdered here.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.605
Some presence came in from

06:28.649 --> 06:30.433
some other bullshit
and we need...

06:30.477 --> 06:32.565
- Disturbance like a chill.
- Yeah, you know, whatever you

06:32.566 --> 06:34.829
can do to sweep
this bitch out of here.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.091
I can't have that in my world.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.398
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.876
Well, ghosts don't
care how they die.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.662
No, they do not care.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.751
They will linger,
they'll linger loose.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.318
Um, they will watch you shower.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.973
Oh, yeah, ghosts ain't
got no shame in the game.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.540
- None.
- Yeah.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.542
You ever feel
an extra hand on the loofah?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.457
- It's the ghost.
- Ghost. -Oh, no.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.110
Atticus, why don't
you salt the perimeter.

06:56.111 --> 06:59.114
I'm gonna salt it.
Getting readings this way.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.810
Getting a lot of readings,
lot of hot readings.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.508
There's definitely
an evil presence in here.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.249
- I'm gonna clear that for you.
- I felt it.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.982
- I think we're good.
- I think we got the presence.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.983
Call if there's
a problem, there won't be.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.681
If you guys need anything,
you should give us a call.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.640
We've taken the evil presence
and take it with us.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.599
- Ticket to go.
- Awesome.

07:49.643 --> 07:52.167
You're all clear.
This place has been swept.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.255
Think it worked?

07:53.298 --> 07:54.735
You think that shit worked?

07:54.778 --> 07:56.084
I don't feel anything.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.522
- Yuck.
- Argh.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.524
- You did terrible tonight.
- I did terrible?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.395
- Yes.
- You grabbed that.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.159
I don't know,
I thought it would be festive.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.182
- Argh.
- Oh my gosh.

08:07.225 --> 08:11.360
- How much old lady stuff can one person fence?
- I know. Jesus.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.405
- Oh, look at that.
- Whoa, what's that?

08:13.449 --> 08:15.059
I don't know. It's like Legos.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.800
Looks like it's
Legos in a teapot?

08:16.844 --> 08:18.541
Hmm, it's candy.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.673
It could be candy.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.197
Da, da, da, it could be drugs.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.547
You can't just be popping pills,
this isn't the '90s.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.593
What kind of pills
would they be?

08:26.636 --> 08:27.985
Could be that new bath salts.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.465
You take it,
next thing you know,

08:29.509 --> 08:31.206
you start eating
each other's faces.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.554
Ah, I know I'd be delicious.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.426
You're not gonna want
seconds of this?

08:34.470 --> 08:36.710
People be lining up, they wanna
get a slice of this face.

08:36.732 --> 08:39.562
There's over 500 pills here.
Atticus, we have to bring these back.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.607
Someone's gonna
definitely miss these.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.479
I don't remember
what house I got them from.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.480
Atticus, think. We're gonna
wake up tomorrow morning,

08:45.481 --> 08:47.962
there's gonna be a Columbian
necktie wrapped around our necks.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.180
Even if I did remember where I got them, what
are we gonna do? Just knock on their door

08:50.181 --> 08:52.574
and say, "Hello, Mr. and Mrs.
Crime Boss, sorry we robbed you,

08:52.575 --> 08:54.489
here's your drugs back,
we'll be on our merry way."

08:54.490 --> 08:56.622
We're gonna be waterboarded,
I promise you that right now.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.059
- I'm not a strong swimmer.
- You think I'm gonna get my bangs wet?

08:59.060 --> 09:01.105
They get all curly.
You know what that looks like?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.497
Maybe it's nothing.
Maybe it's just candy.

09:02.498 --> 09:03.629
Maybe no one is gonna miss it.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.023
But we have to know for sure.

09:06.067 --> 09:10.071
Can't just trust that it's candy. We got
to find someone that's gonna try these.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.874
Someone who doesn't
have a fuck left to give.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.076
I got a guy.

09:32.441 --> 09:36.619
What I did here was I paired this train
wreck which is a high-grade indica

09:36.663 --> 09:39.970
with these Totino's gourmet pepperoni
pizza brawls, girl. You like that?

09:40.014 --> 09:42.712
Wow, it's a really
bold pairing, right.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.192
I know, good looking.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.976
Yeah, it really brings out

09:46.020 --> 09:47.848
the subtle flavors
of the microwaved meat.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.631
Hey, don't even trip
on that, check this out.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.722
I'm just gonna
sprinkle a little kefir here.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.289
I call that kefir savoring.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.901
Yeah.

09:57.945 --> 10:02.253
Kefir savoring
is too intense for my taste.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.994
Don't trip, suck on this.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.432
- Hmm.
- You like that?

10:07.476 --> 10:09.870
The Alexander the Great
Party Pop.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.785
Cools down the richness
of the kefir savoring.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.830
- Wow.
- Wow, mm-hmm.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.398
Real... Wow, really
another great pairing, Rawhide.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.965
- Yeah, I know.
- It's great.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.443
You have a very
sophisticated palate.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.664
Appreciate it,
right on.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.406
- So we did come here for a reason.
- Yeah, wassup?

10:24.449 --> 10:26.450
- Yeah, uh, we found these pills.
- Oh, give them to me.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.409
- We're not sure...
- We don't know if they're any good.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.368
Or poisonous.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.282
Don't trip, I'll go take them.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.023
Okay. Take it.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.635
No, Imma go take 'em.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.419
Go ahead and take it.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.639
Oh, no, no, no, Imma go take.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.946
- Go ahead and... take it.
- Take it.

10:42.990 --> 10:47.559
- No, Imma go.
- Oh.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.866
- He's gonna put it in his penis hole?
- Penis hole?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.127
That's the first hole
you think of?

10:51.128 --> 10:52.521
Where else would he put it?

10:52.564 --> 10:54.044
Who puts things
in their penis hole?

10:54.088 --> 10:55.219
Japanese.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.438
Rhetorical question.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.222
He's putting it in his anus.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.268
Oh, that's the 3rd hole
I was gonna say.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.270
The 3rd?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.097
Well, I stole
the cookies from the cookie jar.

11:04.098 --> 11:07.144
Who me? Yes, you. It could be.

11:07.188 --> 11:11.714
Then who? The hoes.
Hand-job, baby.

11:11.758 --> 11:15.065
Oh, ooh,
look at you, little manna.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.285
I wouldn't let you
be out here by yourself.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.287
Rawhide, I want you
to fuck me in the mouth.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.682
- Fuck me in the mouth?
- I know.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.074
What is that?

11:24.118 --> 11:27.121
I can
show you the world.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.514
- No one wants to see that.
- No, you can't.

11:29.558 --> 11:30.820
Put it away, Princess Jasmine.

11:30.864 --> 11:31.908
No.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.651
Oh, ouch.

11:35.695 --> 11:41.657
Chaite, Chai... Joe, ooh.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.832
What are you doing?

11:42.876 --> 11:44.225
Marketing, everyone's gonna

11:44.268 --> 11:46.706
want these pills
when they see this.

11:46.749 --> 11:52.668
- Ooh-we, I can suck my own dick.
- No, Rawhide.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.192
No, you cannot.
That's not humanly possible.

11:55.236 --> 12:01.242
Oh, yeah, I can if I go back in time.
If I can go faster, I can do it.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.810
I can reverse time just like
Superman, he saved Lois Lane.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.637
Now he's using Superman-logic.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.639
Imma suck this dick, watch this.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.687
Whoa, he's really going for it.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.777
- Oh, yeah.
- He might make it.

12:14.821 --> 12:18.738
Ow, I can taste the tip.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.610
I can suck my own dick.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.788
Oh, yeah, it's working, baby.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.269
Oh, yeah, wow.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.577
I can taste the tip.

12:35.842 --> 12:39.149
Our Taste the Tip video
has over 300,000 views.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.108
Are we settled on
that name, Taste the Tip?

12:41.151 --> 12:42.718
Okay, the comment section is

12:42.762 --> 12:44.327
filled with
people's contact information.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.939
Everyone is begging
to buy these pills.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.418
We don't even
know what they are.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.159
Are pill poppers
that discerning?

12:49.203 --> 12:52.336
That's a good point,
but selling drugs?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.947
- We're gonna be drug dealers?
- It's better than being petty thieves.

12:54.948 --> 12:59.387
Is it? You know, I didn't force you
into having no marketable skill set.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.867
Remember when I met you? You were
outside spinning signs, trying to

13:01.868 --> 13:03.783
get people to
purchase Liberty Insurance.

13:03.826 --> 13:07.308
Hey, my squat and pop was the
envy of all the other spinners.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.788
Should you be
bragging about that?

13:11.355 --> 13:14.532
- Oh, look who it is, Kaitlin.
- Uh, yeah, so?

13:14.576 --> 13:17.927
She's just sending me
advert jobs that she found.

13:17.971 --> 13:21.104
Oh, that's what this is. You're trying
to please her Khaleesi Kaitlin...

13:21.148 --> 13:23.454
- No.
- ...Mother of Dragons, keeper of your nuts.

13:23.498 --> 13:26.153
She's just being helpful.
She's making some really good points

13:26.196 --> 13:28.198
on some of these 400 tests.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.157
She's gonna eventually
trap you with a pregnancy.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.161
- Molly.
- I'm telling you. I know her type.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.118
- She's grooming you, getting you nice and soft.
- Okay.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.206
And then she's gonna
bring you to the slaughter.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.079
Because that's what marriage is?

13:39.122 --> 13:41.908
- Yes, she's gonna have you bleed out slowly.
- Okay.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.475
That's what marriage
is to me, pretty much.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.304
I live with my thrice divorced,
barely functioning, alcoholic mother,

13:47.348 --> 13:49.829
- what do you think?
- Who takes care of who in that situation?

13:49.872 --> 13:50.873
No one knows.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.485
We're just functionally
dependent and codependents.

13:54.529 --> 13:57.880
It's nice. We both need
each other to an extreme.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.883
Yeah, maybe Kaitlin's right.
Maybe I do need something more stable.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.886
- Like selling drugs?
- I can't keep doing this hustle.

14:03.930 --> 14:07.934
I'm tired of this. Stealing people's
watches, ripping people off.

14:07.977 --> 14:13.330
We're doing them a service. We buy into the
delusion that they're being haunted, okay?

14:13.374 --> 14:16.899
They feel better at the end. We get rid of
their demons and yeah, we make a little profit

14:16.943 --> 14:22.035
- and you don't have to go around town doing your pooping squat.
- It's pop, squat and pop.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.558
You look like you were taking a
dump out there, it's all I'm saying.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.214
Alright, clearly, I'm the only
person who cares about our future.

14:27.257 --> 14:30.086
Our future, yours and mine
or yours and Kaitlin's?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.872
- Uh...
- Yeah, okay, well, whatever, mixed signals.

14:32.915 --> 14:36.049
All I'm saying is
we can sell these for at

14:36.092 --> 14:39.052
least 25 bucks each
and we have over 500 of them.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.055
- Give me the list.
- Thank you.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.101
- I'll take that one.
- Alright, fine.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.016
I'll go to the cabin.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.800
You go to the cabin.
I'll go to the cabin.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.410
I'm not going to the cabin,
you go to the cabin.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.543
Fine.
Okay, I'll take the restaurant

14:52.587 --> 14:54.894
- 'cause you have food allergies.
- Okay.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.852
- Are you still gluten sensitive?
- I have a number of things I really don't

14:57.853 --> 14:59.653
wanna talk about
because you make fun of them.

14:59.681 --> 15:02.336
I'm just saying you have a
lot of inflammation for a man.

15:02.379 --> 15:05.121
Look at my skin, it's pale.
I'm not going to the beach, FYI.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.428
You're pretty translucent,
I would not recommend that.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.231
We don't want to
startle people at the beach.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.780
- Fine, we'll do this and then meet back.
- Cool.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.957
I don't like this. I just want the record
to show I think this is a bad idea.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.959
Great,
that probably means it's great.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.395
- Well, let's do this.
- Alright.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.752
- I see a lot of girls every week.
- Right.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.450
But I'm really looking
for somebody really special,

16:13.494 --> 16:16.801
somebody who's got that special
quality that you never see.

16:16.845 --> 16:20.675
I want girls that really wanna make
some money in this business, okay?

16:20.718 --> 16:24.418
- Yeah, of course.
- I can get you the job, but in order for

16:24.461 --> 16:29.075
- you to make money, you have to put up the extra effort.
- I could do a little extra.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.774
Alright, great, so why-why
don't you just get comfortable.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.343
One sec.

16:39.389 --> 16:42.088
Good, good, you're just in time.

16:42.131 --> 16:45.352
- What's going on here?
- Why, you wanna work with us?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.049
You know, I can work with you.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.269
You know, you make
very good content, you know?

16:49.312 --> 16:50.400
Taste the Tip and all.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.445
That was great.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.533
What?

16:53.403 --> 16:54.448
Alright.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.061
No, no, cut.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.020
Wha... what is this?

17:03.109 --> 17:05.502
You are disgusting.
You're ridiculous.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.906
What do you think, she's put
on this planet just to be there

17:07.939 --> 17:11.595
for you and your friends to
suckle jerk each other off? No.

17:11.638 --> 17:13.380
This girl's got
dreams and aspirations.

17:13.423 --> 17:18.602
She's someone's daughter,
someone's single mom. For shame.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.648
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Melanie Melons.

17:21.692 --> 17:25.174
No, no, the name your poor
excuse for parents gave you.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.696
Trinity.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.525
Alright,
you never had a chance, did you?

17:28.569 --> 17:31.267
Listen, you're gonna get
in a career college, alright?

17:31.311 --> 17:33.530
- College?
- You start online. That's right.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.140
- You're gonna take some courses, maybe become a dental hygienist.
- But I... I...

17:35.141 --> 17:36.793
Listen, you wanna be an actress?
We're gonna go

17:36.794 --> 17:38.491
to Groundlings, you'll take
some acting classes,

17:38.492 --> 17:40.929
maybe do a one-woman show,
get some comedy in you.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.062
Let's go, Melons.
Let's get you out of here.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.152
- Give me 30 right now, I need it for my flan.
- Okay.

17:46.195 --> 17:49.198
- Everyone loves his desserts.
- Oh, now I know why.

17:49.242 --> 17:52.201
- But you can't have any.
- Thanks for offering.

17:52.245 --> 17:57.076
- I'm hungry. I want a PB&J, no crust.
- What?

17:57.119 --> 18:00.166
A two-star Michelin chef does not
make food for a barnyard horse.

18:00.209 --> 18:04.909
Fuck you, JO, you fucking ass.
You fucking asshole.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.910
Would you stay with a guy
who never ever went down on you?

18:06.911 --> 18:09.566
Go down or go home. That's
a breach of contract, buddy.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.003
I know you know how to cook,
but not how to eat.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.791
Your food needs seasoning, dick.

18:16.834 --> 18:17.966
Fuck.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.144
Nice doing business with you.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.580
Stop looking at her.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.111
Come in.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.246
No, come in here.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.509
- No.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.380
There was more room
over on that end of the couch.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.339
Next to us.

18:43.383 --> 18:46.386
You guys are on giggling.
Telling jokes?

18:48.039 --> 18:49.879
Are you guys watching
a funny Kevin Hart movie?

18:51.042 --> 18:54.437
- Taste the Tip pills.
- Oh, yeah.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.223
You guys saw the
video, yeah, but you guys ordered

18:57.266 --> 19:00.182
45 of the pills and there's only
two of you here, so that's...

19:00.226 --> 19:01.140
Meow.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.183
What?

19:03.272 --> 19:04.621
- Meow.
- What?

19:04.665 --> 19:06.275
- Meow. Meow, meow.
- That's okay,

19:06.319 --> 19:08.199
you guys don't have
to make those sound effects.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.887
- Uh.
- Kitty bath.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.325
- I don't need a kitty.
- You do.

19:12.368 --> 19:16.285
- Like hell you do.
- I don't want a kitty. I don't want a kitty cat.

19:16.329 --> 19:19.984
I hate cats or titty
tickle or anything else.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.041
Where's
the goddamn teapot?

19:35.043 --> 19:36.131
Damn it.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.109
Have you seen
my mother's teapot?

19:41.354 --> 19:43.791
I stashed the last
bit of pills in there.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.924
Ever since we killed that guy,
we've been hearing things.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.928
You're about to hear
your skulls hit the pavement.

19:48.970 --> 19:53.235
- Who the fuck was here?
- We called these demon cleaners.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.282
You let motherfucking strangers
into my place of business?

19:58.284 --> 19:59.328
We had to.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.245
What the fuck are you twatholes
standing around for?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.420
Find them.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.465
Go.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.553
Jesus Christ.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.869
Okay, guns and ammo division
is doing really good.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.871
If you get four people
to sign up under you

20:20.915 --> 20:22.395
your business
starts to work for you.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.179
We're not selling guns.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.660
We're selling the opportunity
to run your own business.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.705
That's right,
with a starter gun kit at only

20:28.749 --> 20:31.882
$250, you're on your way
to becoming your own boss.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.971
Yo, I already got
three underneath me, homes.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.538
You're on your way to becoming
head distributor of your territory.

20:36.539 --> 20:40.848
- Hell, yeah, that's right. That's what I'm talking about.
- Okay, next topic.

20:40.891 --> 20:43.546
- Movie night last week was a big bust.
- What?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.983
Paul Blart,
Mall Cop got great reviews.

20:46.027 --> 20:48.334
The sequel was
much stronger in terms

20:48.377 --> 20:50.814
of character development,
ese.

20:50.858 --> 20:54.340
Listen, I told you
we should've gone with Magic Mike XL.

20:54.383 --> 20:58.996
It's a masterpiece with a good story
arc, pendejos. Okay, back to business.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.217
We got major competition
in our Ecstasy and pill market.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.306
Hey, it's not my fucking fault.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.787
Someone's out
there with better shit.

21:06.830 --> 21:11.835
This fool took it, reversed time
just so he can go suck his own dick.

21:11.879 --> 21:15.056
- What the fu...
- I can't fucking compete with that shit.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.884
They even have
video, ese, taking

21:16.927 --> 21:18.625
advantage of
social media and shit.

21:18.668 --> 21:19.713
Check it out.

21:21.584 --> 21:28.417
- O-wee, I can suck my own dick.
- No, Rawhide, no you cannot.

21:28.461 --> 21:33.292
- That's not humanly possible.
- Oh, yeah, I can if I go back in time.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.468
If I can go
faster, I can do it.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.905
I can reverse time just like
Superman, he saved Lois Lane.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.080
Imma suck this dick.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.734
Imma suck this dick, watch this.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.478
Oh, that's some
fucking sick ass shit.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.568
- I can taste the tip.
- Fuck.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.831
- No.
- I can suck my own dick.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.398
- What the...
- Nasty shit.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.138
Fucking gross, man,
put that shit away.

21:55.096 --> 21:58.360
Everyone knows
that.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.708
- That's right. That's it.
- That's it, homie.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.668
- Come on.
- Bring them to me dead.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.365
Or alive?

22:06.063 --> 22:07.413
Dead.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.154
O... okay, I change my mind.

22:10.198 --> 22:13.810
Let's start with alive
and rotate onto dead.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.159
Where the fuck you been?

22:15.203 --> 22:16.726
Oh, I am so sorry.

22:16.770 --> 22:20.121
That's the last
we have, so enjoy.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.383
Okay, smells good.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.776
Thank you.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.430
Next time don't
waste my time, you know.

22:24.473 --> 22:25.995
I ain't got time to just
sit around and wait on your ass.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.433
- No, you look busy.
- Alright.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.478
I'm just gonna get going,
so thanks so much.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.698
They call me Spanks
because I keep shit tight.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.396
And you smell like ass crack?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.050
You know what,

22:36.093 --> 22:38.008
you funny,
but I bet you like to suck dick.

22:39.009 --> 22:42.143
Whoa, don't know how the two are
related, but I don't like sucking dick.

22:42.186 --> 22:45.625
- Yeah, I bet you do.
- No, and anyone who says they like it is lying to you.

22:45.668 --> 22:48.541
Have I done it? Yes.
Do I enjoy it? No.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.585
I mean, if I've done something
wrong maybe I'll give one out.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.501
An emergency blowjob,
I've given,

22:52.545 --> 22:55.286
but one for pleasure,
no, sir, sorry.

22:55.330 --> 22:56.766
Let's go grab something to eat.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.768
Thank you, but I had a
big breakfast, I'm not hungry.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.336
You can eat my dick.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.121
Oh, God, you know,
do you know what that

23:04.165 --> 23:06.515
would mean, if I took
your penis and ingested it?

23:06.559 --> 23:09.213
That means you wouldn't have a penis.
You wouldn't have one.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.345
You'd look down there, it'd
be bare. You'd be a Ken Doll.

23:11.346 --> 23:14.349
You wouldn't have a dick,
and then who'd do the thinking for you?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.133
Dyke.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.917
That's the nicest thing
you've said to me, thank you.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.136
- Excuse me.
- Kick rocks.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.529
You kick rocks.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.271
Hello?

23:23.314 --> 23:24.359
Atticus.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.013
Atticus, where are you?

23:26.056 --> 23:28.232
I just lost a
street debate to a crackhead

23:28.276 --> 23:30.452
about my dick sucking
preferences.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.062
Hey, great story, Molly.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.500
I'm in a bit of a predicament.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.327
Where in the name of fuck
are my pills?

23:36.371 --> 23:37.938
Oh, hi.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.419
Of course
I have your merchandise.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.072
I can get it right back to you.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.074
Well, I'm having a
small supply issue right now.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.032
[Atticus screams]

23:45.075 --> 23:47.730
Atticus? Atticus.

23:47.774 --> 23:51.691
- What were you saying?
- Yeah, yeah, I... I have it. I have your stuff.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.374
Because if you don't have what you
stole from me by tomorrow night,

23:54.389 --> 23:55.956
I'm blowing your friend's brains

23:55.999 --> 23:57.958
all over his
shitty outdated iPhone.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.786
Okay, yeah,
just don't hurt him, okay.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.398
Fuck.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.443
Fuck.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.883
Baby, baby, hey, hey, you okay?

24:09.926 --> 24:11.885
I'm
really not okay and quite

24:11.928 --> 24:14.148
frankly, Spanks, you are
not qualified to help me.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.192
I got what you need.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.367
Again with the penis.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.065
I don't want to eat your penis.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.284
Your penis as a food source
does not interest me.

24:20.328 --> 24:23.418
- Come on, baby, you know me better than that.
- I really don't, Spanks.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.898
But I know you

24:24.941 --> 24:27.030
and you need
shit that you already sold.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.728
Were you listening
to my conversation?

24:28.771 --> 24:32.383
I was and I'll take
that fucking money too.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.169
- Fuck, Spanks.
- Come on.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.388
If I give you this money,
my friend's gonna die.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.826
And if you don't
give it to me, you die.

24:39.869 --> 24:43.786
- You wanna revisit that BJ idea?
- Had your fucking chance.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.223
- Thank you.
- Well, you're not welcome.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.531
Fuck.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.505
Hi, I have some stuff to pawn.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.724
Oh, you're in the right place.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.162
Should we open the bag and see

25:12.206 --> 25:15.078
what's in this big old
black bag of mystery, huh?

25:15.122 --> 25:16.253
You like that.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.559
Tell me about this piece.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.518
Well, it's for sale.

25:19.561 --> 25:24.697
Yeah, tennis comes from the
Latin root word Tenetz Oralis,

25:24.740 --> 25:28.135
which is, uh, to be crushed
or destroy with a racket.

25:28.178 --> 25:31.051
I'm in a bit of a rush, I don't need
the whole backstory to all the...

25:31.094 --> 25:35.621
Yeah, well, Spalding '87,
that's a good year.

25:35.664 --> 25:39.363
Oh, look at this,
the player was left-handed,

25:39.407 --> 25:42.149
that's what these
indentations are right here.

25:42.192 --> 25:45.369
You little lefty.
The high acidity level here.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.633
We had a secreter.

25:48.982 --> 25:52.855
PH like 6.5, 6.7,
probably not good at the game,

25:52.899 --> 25:55.075
that's why
the panic sweats are happening.

25:55.118 --> 25:56.816
Getting all that
from huffing a racket?

25:56.859 --> 25:58.426
Well, I'm an expert, pff.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.734
Hmm, yeah, 10 bucks?

26:01.777 --> 26:03.562
- 15.
- 20.

26:03.605 --> 26:09.437
- Okay.
- Okay, he serves, he scores.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.832
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's the candle stakeholders,

26:12.875 --> 26:16.923
yield wax guzzlers is what we call 'em.
Very nice.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.403
You girls are
thirsty for some wax, huh?

26:19.447 --> 26:22.319
You know,
villagers would put these in

26:22.363 --> 26:25.148
the windows just to
alert of the incoming rapists.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.237
I think they just
help people see in the dark.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.370
Well, they do that,
but they also

26:29.413 --> 26:32.634
alert the presence of
rapists who travel in the dark.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.637
In the dark, yeah. I didn't
think about it like that.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.508
- Mm-hmm, you got to.
- Yeah.

26:37.552 --> 26:38.640
- 15.
- 20.

26:38.684 --> 26:39.772
- 25.
- 30.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.295
35.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.689
You're a brutal
negotiator, sir, okay.

26:43.732 --> 26:44.994
Thank you.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.300
I am fearless.

26:46.343 --> 26:50.739
Oh, pearls.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.480
Fun, fun, fun.

26:52.523 --> 26:55.178
You know pearls are
the gossip girls of the sea.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.701
- I didn't know that.
- That's what they call them.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.138
You, uh,
hold one up to your ear,

26:58.181 --> 26:59.792
you can
hear sounds from the ocean.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.837
Um, I think you mean seashells.

27:01.881 --> 27:05.406
No, no, a pearl is gonna tell
you things that seashell won't.

27:05.449 --> 27:09.192
- Oh.
- Hey, that's what she said.

27:09.236 --> 27:11.804
- Okay.
- Oh, what?

27:11.847 --> 27:14.589
No, I can't say that right now,
she's standing right here.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.026
I'm not gonna tell
her that.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.680
I hate to break up
this gossip session.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.290
A real chatty Cathy there, huh?

27:20.334 --> 27:22.379
What am I going to say to her,
I like her shape?

27:22.423 --> 27:25.687
Okay, okay, we'll
both hang up at the same time.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.210
Yeah, let's hang up the same time.
Let's just finish the conversation.

27:28.211 --> 27:29.299
Alright.

27:30.431 --> 27:31.606
And that right there.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.653
Is that what I think it is?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.045
What do you think it is?

27:36.089 --> 27:37.568
A Valerian silver spoon.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.570
The sword medal
from Game of Thrones.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.878
- Precisely.
- Yeah, yeah, that's definitely what that is.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.314
Yeah.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.273
Ah, it's got some weight to it.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.408
Praise be
the Seven Kingdoms, it is.

27:51.452 --> 27:55.717
I'll give you whatever I have
and my undying devotion.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.153
I'll just take the cash.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.677
I need this.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.810
- You can, you... It's yours.
- Thank you.

28:01.854 --> 28:02.854
Thank you.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.249
Jackpot.

28:11.515 --> 28:12.995
What the hell are you doing?

28:13.039 --> 28:15.215
It's a... You've never
heard of a honey facial?

28:15.258 --> 28:16.738
- No.
- Oh, it's great.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.043
- A honey mask?
- Oh, they're good.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.393
No, that sounds filthy.

28:19.436 --> 28:20.742
Oh, no, it's great, it's-it's

28:20.786 --> 28:22.744
actually clean
because it sucks all

28:22.788 --> 28:26.226
the bacteria out of your pores
leaving you smooth and silky.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.097
Oh my God, I'll try that.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.752
Yes, you ever seen
a bee with a wrinkle?

28:30.796 --> 28:32.972
- No. They haven't got it.
- No. I haven't.

28:33.015 --> 28:36.627
- Oh, ow, it's like tingling.
- It's tingling?

28:36.671 --> 28:39.805
- It's working, that means it's working.
- Great. Do I dab it or...

28:39.848 --> 28:41.545
No, it'll burn to
a point where you're

28:41.589 --> 28:44.592
like, "Oh, oh, do I need
to go to see a professional?"

28:44.635 --> 28:46.246
Yeah, this is like just honey?

28:46.289 --> 28:48.378
That's when you wash it off.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.250
Mm-hmm, that's organic honey.

28:50.293 --> 28:51.946
Inspector Reyes,
did you get the video?

28:51.947 --> 28:55.298
- It was sent 45 minutes ago.
- Go for dispatch.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.038
Please confirm
received the video evidence.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.389
That's a negative dispatch,
we didn't get a video.

28:59.433 --> 29:02.305
Yeah, we didn't get a video.
What are they talking about a video?

29:02.349 --> 29:04.480
- We didn't get a video.
- We didn't get a video, they're trying to sandbag.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.396
You guys don't want us
to solve this, do you?

29:06.440 --> 29:09.443
- Don't sandbag us.
- I've seen this before.

29:09.486 --> 29:13.534
- These bees are crazy creatures.
- They send us.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.188
Oh, they did send us something.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.102
- Oh, they did, okay.
- They sent... Okay, it's on...

29:17.103 --> 29:18.582
Sometimes it goes
to your junk mail.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.149
Hold it, it ju... What?

29:20.193 --> 29:21.890
Sometimes it-
things go to your junk mail.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.196
Dispatch, are you still there?

29:23.239 --> 29:24.850
- Copy.
- We got it.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.634
- We're all here.
- We got it now.

29:26.677 --> 29:28.113
- It was in a junk file.
- Well, it wasn't in a junk file,

29:28.114 --> 29:30.986
- but sometimes that happens.
- We got it.

29:31.030 --> 29:34.294
Sometimes things are in junk files, so
we don't, you know, get all our emails.

29:34.337 --> 29:37.819
- You're lucky this time.
- Okay.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.995
Does this car
have a honey holder?

29:40.039 --> 29:43.738
No, this is like... I'll tell you how
to... Is there like a cap on these?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.902
- Yeah. There's a lot of honey.
- Oh, I got the video.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.656
- Okay, okay, great. Okay.
- You know what?

29:48.699 --> 29:51.137
You're gonna have to Sp...
Come on, come on, you're

29:51.180 --> 29:53.529
gonna have to spin around a lot
faster if you want to go back in time.

29:53.530 --> 29:56.533
Oh, yeah, I mean... Do you think he's
got the tip? Is he tasting the tip?

29:56.577 --> 29:59.188
- I can taste the tip.
- Oh, wait. He's tasting the tip.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.235
- He's tasting the tip. Oh my God, that is...
- Yes, victory.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.368
Taste your tip.

30:05.412 --> 30:07.196
Yeah, it's really great.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.851
Woo. How about... We should...

30:09.895 --> 30:11.939
- Thank you, dispatch.
- Mm-hmm. We should get back to the case.

30:11.940 --> 30:16.989
- Yeah, sure.
- I have honey on the phone.

30:17.032 --> 30:19.729
- Who do you think this is? Do you think this is the cartel?
- Yeah, probably.

30:19.730 --> 30:22.821
- It's probably the...
- Uh, Los Robles, uh, Daddy Boy.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.387
Mm-hmm. The Angry Samoans.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.476
- Pig Titans.
- The Muay Thais.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.479
- Fruit Wranglers.
- And then Peto and his mom.

30:29.523 --> 30:32.351
Yeah. Peto and his mom is not really
a gang, they're just... they're just...

30:32.352 --> 30:35.050
- You ever met his mom?
- I'm so sticky.

30:36.486 --> 30:40.055
My Intel tells me that they moved
a teenth of Molly in one day.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.449
- What, a full teenth?
- Yeah, do you want this stuff

30:42.492 --> 30:43.842
out on the streets
with your kids?

30:43.885 --> 30:45.582
No. No, not my kids.

30:45.626 --> 30:47.106
I only get them
one weekend a month.

30:47.149 --> 30:48.672
Aw, how's Trevor?

30:48.716 --> 30:49.673
He's fine.

30:49.717 --> 30:50.761
Yeah, so we got to...

30:50.805 --> 30:52.415
To just discover the tracks.

30:52.459 --> 30:55.157
- Huh. Is it tingling now?
- I'm not.

30:55.201 --> 30:56.854
I'm really liking the way
it's running down my face.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.031
No, just keep that there
for like four hours.

31:08.692 --> 31:11.304
Rawhide, I'm so sorry
to bother you at work.

31:12.261 --> 31:15.134
I need some of those pills
that you took the other night.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.398
Hell yeah, you do.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.356
That shit fucked me up, girl.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.968
No, I need someone who's
going to sell me those pills.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.579
Oh, you want to see my boy
Skullfucker over at MacArthur Park.

31:25.622 --> 31:27.798
- You've been there?
- Not on purpose.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.278
- I Don't trip.
- I won't trip.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.672
Up on,
there's a doughnut shop,

31:31.715 --> 31:34.240
Yim-Yum-Yums, you know them?

31:34.283 --> 31:35.937
I... I'm familiar with the brand.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.765
Those two Asian people,
two Yum-Yum-Yums.

31:37.808 --> 31:40.028
You know them, alright.
Listen, they should know you.

31:40.072 --> 31:43.162
- There's two taco trucks, a big ass house...
- Alright.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.511
...and the smell of shit just
gone slap you just like that.

31:45.512 --> 31:46.948
Do you have
like a street address?

31:46.992 --> 31:48.689
Did I mention
the smell shit real quick.

31:48.732 --> 31:49.733
You did.

31:49.777 --> 31:51.083
Alright, that's the one.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.476
- Okay, alright.
- You packing?

31:53.520 --> 31:54.825
Like a snack?

31:54.869 --> 31:56.174
- I have a LUNA Bar.
- A LUNA Bar?

31:56.175 --> 31:57.523
I'm talking about
urban accessories.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.047
Oh, like Fubu.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.963
Ain't nobody talking
about no For Us By Us.

32:02.007 --> 32:05.488
- I'm talking about some steel, some weapons.
- No, I'm unpacked.

32:05.532 --> 32:08.099
Alright, then you wanna see my
boy, Ulon, you know him, don't you?

32:08.100 --> 32:10.624
I don't. I don't know any of
these people, Rawhide.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.495
AKA the Sapporo, you know him.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.673
He's a former Tibetan monk,
who now sells

32:16.717 --> 32:18.414
weapons and makes love to girls.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.851
He's a former Tibetan monk
that sells guns?

32:20.895 --> 32:24.029
The niggas are violent.
That's my boy. See him.

32:24.072 --> 32:25.856
Okay, I'm gonna get packed.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.466
- I'm gonna go to Skullfucker.
- Alright.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.163
- I'm gonna be right back.
- Yeah, yeah, alright..

32:29.164 --> 32:31.558
You'll be here. You're not doing
anything else, right?

32:31.601 --> 32:35.431
- I ain't doing shit.
- I didn't think so. Okay, thanks.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.433
I'm smoking shit.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.741
Hey.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.181
I am so sorry to
interrupt your meditation.

32:46.225 --> 32:49.054
Rawhide sent me here
to get some weaponry.

32:49.097 --> 32:50.577
Uh, yes.

32:54.494 --> 32:59.760
Hmm, hmm, uh,
hmm mumbles:. Huh.

32:59.803 --> 33:03.764
- Someone has stolen something from you, yes?
- Yes.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.897
- Mmm, what did he take?
- Took... took my money.

33:06.941 --> 33:09.509
- Wrong.
- No, he took like $10,000.

33:09.552 --> 33:14.035
No, he has stolen
the inner warrior from you.

33:14.079 --> 33:18.300
You must birth him again, feel him
grow stronger inside of your womb.

33:18.344 --> 33:19.475
Can I get him out now?

33:19.519 --> 33:23.044
No, he is far from ready.

33:23.088 --> 33:26.004
- Do you feel him kicking?
- Sure.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.789
Can I just get
a gun or something?

33:28.832 --> 33:32.967
Foolish child.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.753
You cannot choose the weapon,
the weapon chooses you.

33:37.754 --> 33:38.973
Okay, great.

33:50.463 --> 33:54.206
Now clench your womb.
Are you clenching it?

33:54.249 --> 33:57.861
- Yes, yes, it's clenched.
- Now grunt from your uterus.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.604
The uterus grunt.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.302
Again.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.782
Again.

34:06.827 --> 34:12.311
No.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.706
Mmm... huh!

34:30.503 --> 34:35.551
Now, loosen your fallopian tube
as you focus on this orange.

34:35.594 --> 34:38.250
Can we stay out of my
reproductive system for a second?

34:38.293 --> 34:42.384
And the uterus grunt.

34:45.996 --> 34:48.129
No.

34:48.172 --> 34:49.348
No!

34:53.047 --> 34:56.137
Huh.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.933
Wow, you really
got into that.

35:09.977 --> 35:15.504
Okay,
now, tighten your womb.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.115
It's tight, Miyagi, back up.

35:18.681 --> 35:19.943
And the uterus grunt.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.255
- No.
- No.

35:27.299 --> 35:28.648
Close your eyes.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.039
You better not be
getting me pregnant.

35:30.040 --> 35:34.001
The weapon has chosen you.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.962
What? A rock? What will you do
with this, stone somebody?

35:39.006 --> 35:43.141
Uh, David has defeated
Goliath with a pebble.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.795
Yeah, well, I'm going to
see a dealer named Skullfucker.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.623
The weapon has spoken.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.061
It didn't say shit to me.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.207
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.775
- What's up, beautiful?
- Very sweet of you.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.951
- Let me get in.
- Oh, that's okay.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.910
No, you don't have to,
uh, stink up my car.

36:13.954 --> 36:17.740
Uh, hi,
I'm looking for a dealer.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.003
- McDonald's, is this yours?
- Uh, no, that's trash.

36:20.047 --> 36:23.659
Oh, I'm gonna eat it.
I'm loving this ketchup.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.705
I'm looking for a guy named

36:25.748 --> 36:28.447
Skullfucker, I don't think
that's his Christian name.

36:28.490 --> 36:31.232
- Skullfucker?
- Yeah, Mr. Skullfucker.

36:31.276 --> 36:34.279
- I'm not sure how he likes to be addressed.
- Are you sick?

36:34.322 --> 36:37.673
He's a... Well, I need drugs,
it's kind of a complicated story...

36:37.717 --> 36:39.588
You should be going
to Kaiser Permanente.

36:39.632 --> 36:42.809
Skullfucker's shit will
make you sick, I should know.

36:42.852 --> 36:45.159
Thanks, you should
speak at public schools.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.117
You're a real mentor.

36:47.161 --> 36:48.597
Thank you.

36:48.641 --> 36:50.947
So, uh,
could you just tell me where

36:50.991 --> 36:53.646
this gentleman
Skullfucker lives so I can...

36:53.689 --> 36:55.037
Yeah,
he's right here on the right.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.083
Wait, right here?

36:57.476 --> 36:59.521
Right here on the right.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.609
Oh.

37:01.654 --> 37:05.266
Oh, so thank you so much.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.399
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, so you

37:07.442 --> 37:09.836
want me to sleep
in your car tonight?

37:09.879 --> 37:11.707
What a generous offer.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.448
I'm just so good for right now.

37:14.536 --> 37:15.581
Oh.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.583
Okay, your lost, bro.

37:17.626 --> 37:18.758
Oh.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.202
This way, hurry up,
come on, get in.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.286
- Anybody follow you?
- No.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.422
- You alone?
- Yes.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.032
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No.

37:32.075 --> 37:34.295
- You got weapons?
- Oh, no, I'm clear.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.254
I'm all clear. Uh...

37:36.297 --> 37:39.344
You can't be too sure.
Uh, you like kids?

37:39.387 --> 37:41.694
I'd have my own,
but I don't want to.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.642
I got three different kids
from three different women.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.916
- Have you seen my mommy?
- I just wish one of them would take care of

37:47.917 --> 37:50.616
their responsibilities. You can't
be pregnant and fucking leave.

37:50.659 --> 37:53.339
- - That's why I
think he has to go to the bathroom.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.666
What the fuck, Jesus?
Where's my fucking money?

37:57.710 --> 37:59.842
Do you know why
they call me Skullfucker?

37:59.886 --> 38:01.540
'Cause I fuck skulls.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.455
That's what I do. I love it.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.630
- Can I have some juice, daddy?
- Give me a skull of any size,

38:05.631 --> 38:07.763
any race,
I'll fuck that skull, okay?

38:07.807 --> 38:10.679
I'm just gonna pick up, honey.
Good job.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.942
Give me a skull socket
and I'll fuck it.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.509
You know why
they call me Skullfucker?

38:14.553 --> 38:19.166
'Cause I fuck skulls
and I don't fucking stop.

38:19.209 --> 38:23.344
I'll make a fucking force get into
a fucking yarmulke, motherfucker.

38:23.388 --> 38:27.348
It's gonna be fucking Passover
every fucking day, motherfucker.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.743
I don't give a shit. I'll... I'll
fucking get a fucking drill and hammer

38:30.786 --> 38:33.485
the back of the head
and fuck that fucking hole.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.705
I don't give a shit. I'll put your
fucking skull on my cock and it's gonna

38:36.749 --> 38:38.706
be on there, you know,
and it's going to be just...

38:38.707 --> 38:41.231
I can spin it around and I'll
just go... Get up behind it

38:41.275 --> 38:43.843
and do little characters
and faith fucking.

38:43.886 --> 38:47.542
I'll put my fingers in that skull and like
it's a finger fucking you to fuck skull.

38:47.586 --> 38:51.633
I'll finger your fucking skull. I'm gonna go
fucking balls deep in that fucking nose cartilage.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.375
My balls are fucking going...
I'm... And I'm just gonna fuck it.

38:54.419 --> 38:57.856
I'm gonna make that skull come a fucking live.
That skull is gonna fucking talk out loud,

38:57.857 --> 39:00.257
do you understand what I'm saying?
Hava Nagila, motherfucker.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.906
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, God. That's okay.

39:03.950 --> 39:07.170
- Listen, can we talk business?
- Okay.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.782
Maybe we could talk,
you know, just one on one.

39:09.825 --> 39:12.175
Bradley, El Nino,
get ready for bed.

39:12.219 --> 39:16.049
Wow, great kids,
you must treasure every day.

39:16.092 --> 39:18.051
It's tough to
put food on the table.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.705
I've got to suck dick
for diapers.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.314
I've never heard of
that currency exchange.

39:21.315 --> 39:23.273
It's usually one dick per diaper

39:23.317 --> 39:25.363
or gain mega dicks
for a packet of diapers.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.713
- That's a good deal.
- I call it Pounding for Pampers.

39:27.756 --> 39:30.411
- That's catchy.
- I got a program where if you, uh, you know, you

39:30.455 --> 39:34.023
give me six diapers, I give
you one extra fucking dick suck.

39:34.067 --> 39:36.504
- Almost like a rewards club.
- Yes, it's a reward for fuck.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.071
I have a little card I made out,
where I'll scan it and then, like,

39:39.072 --> 39:43.990
I'll have a deal every now and then.
Like, "Hey, just give me maybe a diaper

39:44.033 --> 39:46.384
- and I'll suck your dick twice."
- The math checks out.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.298
It's important to me
to keep my customers.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.127
So I got myself in a
little bit of a situation.

39:51.171 --> 39:53.956
- Yeah, you got three kids you can't afford?
- No.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.307
My friend's been kidnapped
and if I don't replace

39:57.351 --> 40:00.485
these, like, Lego looking
pills, they're like Ecstasy.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.270
These drugs that makes people
kinda fucked up, but I need it.

40:03.313 --> 40:07.709
- How much you want?
- Could you just get me enough to fill this teapot?

40:07.753 --> 40:09.581
- Teenth?
- Yeah.

40:09.624 --> 40:10.624
Yeah, I can do it.

40:34.562 --> 40:37.739
Alright, I got our stuff.

40:39.306 --> 40:40.525
Well, what...

40:41.700 --> 40:44.354
- This don't look the same.
- Nope.

40:44.398 --> 40:47.880
- Look like Skullfucker got you.
- Rawhide, you said he was your boy.

40:47.923 --> 40:51.013
I call everybody my boy.
Like my boy Céline and my boy Trump.

40:51.057 --> 40:52.885
You say my boy Céline Dion?

40:52.928 --> 40:56.149
- More than you know.
- Hmph, well, great.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.032
Let me see what these do.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.762
Alright, I got...
I got to take this call.

41:00.806 --> 41:03.286
- Hi, Kaitlin.
- Let's cut the chit chat.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.724
Atticus' phone
is dead and so is he.

41:05.767 --> 41:09.902
Oh, and when I find him, it will
be the last time he is seen alive.

41:09.945 --> 41:12.165
I will take him Revenant style.

41:12.208 --> 41:15.951
I will mount him like a grizzly and
shred him from pubis to sternum.

41:15.995 --> 41:18.693
I will wear Atticus' hand
as a trophy necklace.

41:24.220 --> 41:28.311
Molly, we have
an amazing problem here.

41:28.355 --> 41:31.880
Ah, wh... wh... what is that?

41:31.924 --> 41:34.535
That, my friend,
is Joey Lawrence.

41:34.579 --> 41:37.016
You call
your penis Joey Lawrence?

41:37.059 --> 41:43.762
- Yeah, when bitches see this, they go, "whoa".
- Oh my God.

41:43.805 --> 41:46.242
Alright, let me
just see what you just took.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.897
Rawhide, you shouldn't just
be taking so many like that.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.245
- How many...
- I don't give a fuck.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.291
Argh.

41:52.553 --> 41:54.903
Okay, first of all,
how many did you take?

41:54.947 --> 42:00.735
- Uh, more than directed.
- Jesus Christ.

42:00.779 --> 42:03.651
- Okay, wait, I think this is it.
- That's it.

42:03.695 --> 42:06.872
- Expands male enhancement.
- What is that?

42:06.915 --> 42:08.700
You know,
it's for them baby dicks.

42:08.743 --> 42:11.485
- For a baby's dick?
- Not a baby's dick, girl.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.531
A grown ass man
with a baby dick.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.274
Well, what the hell am I going to
do with a teenth of baby dick pills?

42:18.318 --> 42:22.627
- Craig's List.
- Oh, that's not a bad idea, Rawhide, and you've

42:22.670 --> 42:24.585
had some bad ideas,
but this one was a good one.

42:24.629 --> 42:26.152
Alright. Let's see.

42:26.195 --> 42:27.501
How do we start this off?

42:27.545 --> 42:29.634
We have them baby dick pills.

42:30.591 --> 42:33.463
Good, but maybe
a little more subtle,

42:33.507 --> 42:36.728
like, uh,
"Feeling small and alone?"

42:36.771 --> 42:38.556
You ever been so fucked up,

42:38.599 --> 42:40.383
you cried over
having a teeny dick?

42:40.427 --> 42:42.429
Embarrassed about
something you can't help?

42:43.648 --> 42:46.912
How about, "The best
way to please a whore."

42:46.955 --> 42:50.306
- Looking for a way to please your lady?
- Yeah, that too.

42:50.350 --> 42:54.049
We can say bitch or hoe just
to open up the forum. Done.

42:54.093 --> 42:59.838
- What are you going to do with that?
- Two words. Full House.

42:59.881 --> 43:02.492
- You know why they call it Full House?
- Why?

43:02.536 --> 43:05.844
Because them bitches got
some big ass titties now, girl.

43:05.887 --> 43:07.672
I don't think that's
the premise of the show.

43:07.715 --> 43:09.761
For me, it's got to be Gibbler

43:09.804 --> 43:11.980
'cause you know
Gibbler's a gobbler.

43:12.024 --> 43:13.634
I didn't know that about her.

43:13.678 --> 43:15.984
Well, I'm going to add it
to my queue on Netflix.

43:16.028 --> 43:18.334
Oh, shit, I got a hit
on the Craig's List ad.

43:18.378 --> 43:19.771
- Okay.
- Word.

43:19.814 --> 43:21.511
- Rawhide.
- Word.

43:21.555 --> 43:25.167
Uh, please seek
medical attention for that. I...

43:25.211 --> 43:27.126
You don't trip over that.

43:27.169 --> 43:28.214
Hey, I'm cool.

43:36.526 --> 43:37.658
Hi, you must be Rodney.

43:37.702 --> 43:38.920
Hi, yeah.

43:38.964 --> 43:40.269
Oh, were you in a car accident?

43:40.313 --> 43:41.880
Not to my knowledge, no.

43:41.923 --> 43:43.664
Oh, come on in.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.187
Okay.

43:50.932 --> 43:52.368
So?

43:52.412 --> 43:58.200
Uh, uh... So,
you wanna get started?

43:58.244 --> 44:00.246
Yeah, oh, yeah, no,
I'm sure you're busy.

44:00.289 --> 44:01.943
I'm so sorry, Rodney.

44:01.987 --> 44:03.597
You just take your time, ma'am.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.948
- Give me a minute.
- Oh, me too.

44:06.992 --> 44:11.344
- Hold on. Here we go.
- Give me a second there.

44:11.387 --> 44:13.476
So I apologize for
the container, it's not that...

44:13.520 --> 44:15.653
- Nice.
- What the fuck, Rodney?

44:15.696 --> 44:18.307
- Rodney's ready to get grapefruited.
- Grapefruited?

44:18.351 --> 44:19.699
Rodney's ready
to get grapefruited.

44:19.700 --> 44:21.093
No, I'm trying
to sell you drugs.

44:21.136 --> 44:22.094
Drugs, blah.

44:22.137 --> 44:23.530
No, Rodney is insulted.

44:23.573 --> 44:25.213
You're holding a
grapefruit at your penis.

44:25.227 --> 44:27.621
- Fruit? Come on.
- No, I'm sorry.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.057
I don't know
what grapefruiting is.

44:29.101 --> 44:30.537
What's being grapfruited?

44:31.799 --> 44:33.583
Uh, does nobody freaking know?

44:33.627 --> 44:35.237
Listen,
I've never heard of that.

44:35.281 --> 44:37.152
Alright, I'll show you the deal.

44:37.196 --> 44:39.502
Oh, well, your screen-saver
leaves much to be desired.

44:39.546 --> 44:42.418
Well, there are
those who like it.

44:42.462 --> 44:44.551
- I don't.
- Alright. Press play.

44:48.120 --> 44:51.689
Now, this is my bonus technique,
the grapefruit. I want to share this...

44:51.732 --> 44:53.168
- Grapefruit, sure.
- Yep.

44:53.212 --> 44:55.823
- Citrus is key to any good diet.
- It is.

44:55.867 --> 44:57.345
- I can see how that's important.
- Right.

44:57.346 --> 44:58.304
So what you need to do...

44:58.347 --> 45:00.175
It's delicious.

45:00.219 --> 45:01.915
You need to, of
course, have a grapefruit.

45:01.916 --> 45:03.701
You wanna make sure
you get the ruby red.

45:03.744 --> 45:04.745
It's sweeter, it's easy.

45:04.789 --> 45:07.226
Ah, just do that.

45:07.269 --> 45:08.748
The reason why you want to roll
it is because you want to juice it up.

45:08.749 --> 45:11.404
- Rodney, put down the...
- I don't care.

45:11.447 --> 45:14.647
So you should have a grapefruit that
has two sides missing just like this.

45:15.538 --> 45:18.497
Now what you gonna do is you gonna put
a hole in the middle of the grapefruit

45:18.498 --> 45:20.760
- approximately the size of your man's penis.
- A hole on his penis.

45:20.761 --> 45:23.808
- I don't like where this is going, Rodney.
- Well, you need a hole.

45:23.851 --> 45:26.201
Otherwise, it's just-
it's useless without a hole.

45:26.245 --> 45:28.856
Just like you said
you were going to do.

45:28.900 --> 45:31.206
Oh, my God.
Rodney, take it away.

45:31.250 --> 45:33.992
What the fuck was that?
What was she doing to that thing?

45:34.035 --> 45:35.820
She was putting it in her mouth

45:35.863 --> 45:38.083
and felating it 'cause
that's what grapefruiting is.

45:38.126 --> 45:41.956
You get your cock wet with grapefruit
juice, and then you would just suck it.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.525
- That's what grapefruiting is.
- I get that now.

45:45.568 --> 45:47.745
I'm not grapefruiting you.
I'm sorry.

45:47.788 --> 45:51.879
You know what, why the hell did
I come over here from Cerritos?

45:51.923 --> 45:56.362
You're killing me. Your ad said
very clearly, "You will not be

45:56.405 --> 45:59.408
judged, not judged
for anything that you want

45:59.452 --> 46:02.977
that you cannot help."
Well, Rodney thought

46:03.021 --> 46:05.980
that tonight,
tonight would be different.

46:07.155 --> 46:08.766
- It's not different.
- No.

46:08.809 --> 46:13.161
Sadly, I am
a fragile man.

46:13.205 --> 46:15.033
It's not gonna...
It's not gonna happen.

46:16.382 --> 46:18.427
Oh, hey, don't, uh...

46:18.471 --> 46:20.821
Rodney knows there's some shame.

46:20.865 --> 46:22.823
Rodney's not an idiot.

46:22.867 --> 46:26.131
- I'm not an idiot.
- Hey, don't get emotional.

46:26.174 --> 46:30.265
No, such miles, but Rodney
doesn't get lucky at anything.

46:30.309 --> 46:32.964
Rodney just has a world of crap.

46:33.007 --> 46:35.357
- No, it's not his night.
- No.

46:35.401 --> 46:37.403
He'll meet that
special someone who can't wait

46:37.446 --> 46:40.362
to go to town on your freshly
grapefruited schvantz.

46:40.406 --> 46:43.844
Rodney could find a girl like
that. A real grapefruiter.

46:43.888 --> 46:46.891
Maybe at a Trader Joe's
or a Food 4 Less?

46:46.934 --> 46:49.023
Rodney would love that
more than anything.

46:49.067 --> 46:51.156
- Okay. But you know what?
- What?

46:51.199 --> 46:53.200
In Rodney's whole life, no one's
ever actually loved Rodney.

46:53.201 --> 46:55.247
- That's personal.
- No, no one ever has.

46:55.290 --> 46:59.120
- It's still personal.
- Just 48 years, nothing.

46:59.164 --> 47:01.209
Going through life
without anyone.

47:01.253 --> 47:02.732
- No.
- That's true.

47:02.776 --> 47:04.429
Rodney's parents
wouldn't even get him a pet.

47:04.430 --> 47:06.824
"Rodney, you can't have a pet.

47:06.867 --> 47:09.827
Rodney, you're just
a useless piece of crap

47:09.870 --> 47:11.829
who doesn't look
after himself, and so

47:11.872 --> 47:13.874
how could you possibly
look after a pet?

47:13.918 --> 47:15.745
Why would that
even cross your mind?

47:15.789 --> 47:17.138
You're such a
stupid little idiot.

47:17.182 --> 47:19.880
Rodney, why don't
you just go to your room

47:19.924 --> 47:23.536
and read Lord of the Rings books
and be quiet. Just be quiet.

47:23.579 --> 47:29.368
Read The Silmarillion, Rodney." Silmarillion,
no one reads The Silmarillion, it's terrible.

47:29.411 --> 47:35.548
- I've never even heard of that.
- No, it's the lore of the first age of elves.

47:35.591 --> 47:38.290
I'm surprised
you don't have a girlfriend.

47:38.333 --> 47:41.902
Rodney, let's keep this inside.
Keep this bottled up.

47:41.946 --> 47:43.948
Hold this in.
Let's hold this in.

47:43.991 --> 47:46.254
- You know what?
- It's all gonna come out now.

47:46.298 --> 47:50.476
Hey, hey, what if
I can get you a pet? Huh?

47:50.519 --> 47:52.391
- Really? A pet?
- Yeah, would you like that?

47:52.434 --> 47:54.194
Yeah, my mom brings home
all kinds of strays,

47:54.219 --> 47:57.091
and I got a real,
real good one for you.

47:57.135 --> 47:58.787
- Rodney would love a pet.
- It's needs a home. Would you like that?

47:58.788 --> 48:00.703
- Yeah.
- Will you stop crying?

48:00.747 --> 48:02.792
Okay, keep your pants on,
I'll be right back.

48:02.836 --> 48:04.097
- Can you keep your pants on?
- I can.

48:04.098 --> 48:05.378
Can you put the grapefruit away?

48:05.404 --> 48:08.407
Okay, I'm going
to get you a pet.

48:11.323 --> 48:13.586
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Isn't he?

48:13.629 --> 48:15.283
This is Pablo Escobar.

48:17.546 --> 48:20.767
You know my brother stole a train
set from me when I was ten years old.

48:20.810 --> 48:24.466
- Uh-huh.
- I loved that thing.

48:24.510 --> 48:26.555
I especially loved
shoving a caboose down

48:26.599 --> 48:28.949
his throat until
he choked and died.

48:28.993 --> 48:31.473
My parents were so scared of me.

48:31.517 --> 48:33.127
They buried the body
in the backyard

48:33.171 --> 48:35.913
and they never said
a word to me about it.

48:35.956 --> 48:37.131
I loved my brother.

48:38.828 --> 48:42.441
Can you imagine what I would do
to a stranger who stole from me?

48:42.484 --> 48:44.878
Sir, I'm already
really terrified,

48:44.922 --> 48:47.794
so I've got your message
loud and clear. Believe me.

48:47.837 --> 48:49.187
Good, you should be scared.

48:52.799 --> 48:55.454
I still have the baby
dick pills. He didn't want them.

48:55.497 --> 48:59.458
He wanted to be grapefruited. Well, it's when
you get your cock wet with grapefruit juice.

48:59.501 --> 49:01.501
I'm going to the police.
I can't take this anymore.

49:01.503 --> 49:04.115
I can't save Atticus with...
Wait, what? Hey, hey.

49:04.158 --> 49:07.422
Yeah, that's great. That is
great news. Great. Okay, bye.

49:07.466 --> 49:09.424
Breaking the case?

49:09.468 --> 49:13.733
No, even better. I just got a
callback for NCISCSI Pittsburg.

49:13.776 --> 49:17.389
- What?
- Oh, it's like NCIS and CSI together.

49:17.432 --> 49:20.218
- It's set in Pittsburg.
- Oh, it's in Pittsburg. That's great.

49:20.261 --> 49:23.917
- Yeah.
- Wow, wow, this will probably be your last case.

49:23.961 --> 49:27.181
- Ah, wow.
- And you're so good.

49:27.225 --> 49:31.272
Well, I mean, I couldn't have
gotten here without you, though.

49:31.316 --> 49:34.754
- Hey, zip.
- Zap.

49:34.797 --> 49:36.321
- Zop.
- Zip.

49:39.106 --> 49:42.065
- Oh, I messed up.
- Oh, messed up. Oh, God, don't do that on that audition.

49:42.066 --> 49:46.896
- Am I ready?
- Oh my God, don't do that in NCISCSI Pittsburgh.

49:46.940 --> 49:47.810
Yeah.

49:47.854 --> 49:51.336
Oh, boy. Hey, meat.

49:52.554 --> 49:54.513
- Cake.
- Meat Cake.

49:54.556 --> 49:55.688
- Da da da.
- Do do do.

49:55.731 --> 49:57.907
- Oh.
- Be da, be do do do.

49:57.951 --> 50:00.431
Be do, Ba da da da? In level three,
they teach you "Be da da da".

50:00.432 --> 50:01.872
- Okay, let's do that.
- Okay, great.

50:05.785 --> 50:08.614
- Hey, guys, um...
- You fucked with the wrong cabron.

50:08.657 --> 50:10.616
It's just a big
misunderstanding.

50:10.659 --> 50:12.400
I'm sure we can
all work past this.

50:12.444 --> 50:14.924
Well, I don't have the ability
to understand things?

50:14.968 --> 50:17.579
No, no.

50:20.104 --> 50:22.193
It's just it's was a...
It's a long story.

50:22.236 --> 50:24.107
My friend and I were
stealing and we didn't mean

50:24.108 --> 50:26.893
to steal these drugs,
and, well, anyway, he's

50:26.936 --> 50:30.201
probably gonna die and I'm gonna die.
Have you ever had friends like that who

50:30.244 --> 50:32.290
talks too much
and just won't stop talking?

50:32.333 --> 50:34.074
That's like my friend,
Atticus, but he's

50:34.118 --> 50:37.034
probably not
going to live past today.

50:37.077 --> 50:38.513
Anyway,
I'm really sorry and I just

50:38.557 --> 50:40.341
hope we can work
this out peacefully.

50:40.385 --> 50:43.518
You're just a regular old
flat foot from New York City.

50:43.562 --> 50:44.998
Okay.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.957
Great, so what's
your audition for NCISCSI?

50:48.001 --> 50:50.569
- Um, I am a busboy.
- Oh, okay.

50:50.612 --> 50:54.007
- Great, so you wanna run... Wanna run your line?
- Yeah.

50:57.532 --> 50:59.578
- So everyone's there.
- Uh-huh.

50:59.621 --> 51:01.971
And then she
just found out that,

51:02.015 --> 51:03.798
you know, she didn't
get the money for a project.

51:03.799 --> 51:06.411
You're already
complicating it a lot.

51:06.454 --> 51:07.455
Here's your waters?

51:08.456 --> 51:10.371
Who is your supplier?

51:10.415 --> 51:12.460
I don't have a supplier.

51:12.504 --> 51:14.332
Ever since
Breaking Bad, everyone

51:14.375 --> 51:16.986
thinks they're
Walter fucking White.

51:17.030 --> 51:20.599
- I never watched the show. I never had time.
- Let me see that shit.

51:22.470 --> 51:24.472
Is this your latest batch?

51:24.516 --> 51:26.083
Yeah, yeah, so you can just

51:26.126 --> 51:27.910
have that and I'll be on my way.

51:27.954 --> 51:29.869
Just consider that
a gift from me to you,

51:29.912 --> 51:31.523
you know,
'cause we're friends now.

51:33.351 --> 51:36.136
This don't look
like the same shit.

51:36.180 --> 51:40.793
Well, there's just a slightly different
side effect, but also very good.

51:40.836 --> 51:41.924
They're very good.

51:45.406 --> 51:48.322
Oh, you're just gonna...
Just palm it like that, okay.

51:48.366 --> 51:50.150
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

51:50.194 --> 51:51.754
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.371
One, two,
three, four, five, six.

51:53.414 --> 51:57.984
One, two,
three, four, five.

52:00.726 --> 52:02.815
- Oh my God, what happened?
- I'm okay.

52:02.858 --> 52:05.252
- What happened?
- I'm okay. I'm good.

52:06.688 --> 52:08.299
I don't feel shit.

52:08.342 --> 52:10.388
Well, it's not
really a cerebral effect.

52:10.431 --> 52:16.829
- It's more of a physical one.
- What the fuck?

52:16.872 --> 52:19.092
Well, I don't see anything
different in your penis size.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.007
Are you saying
I have?

52:21.050 --> 52:22.878
No, no, never.

52:27.535 --> 52:30.059
You're saying I have
strong, big, clean balls?

52:30.930 --> 52:32.279
Yeah.

52:32.323 --> 52:33.237
Hmm, hmm, you do.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.021
Hells yes, you do.

52:35.064 --> 52:37.154
And, guys, aren't we
being a little hasty here?

52:37.197 --> 52:39.634
Don't we have a potential
goldmine on our hands?

52:39.678 --> 52:42.398
You're saying you want me to the be
the face of a baby dick campaign?

52:43.247 --> 52:46.075
I don't know if I'd market it like that.
I would say, you know,

52:46.119 --> 52:48.600
let's start a helpful blog,
build a core audience, you know.

52:48.643 --> 52:50.732
You never know where
these things can take off.

52:50.776 --> 52:53.605
I decide what I sell
and how I sell it.

52:53.648 --> 52:56.173
I also decide who lives or dies.

52:57.391 --> 53:00.089
Do you know which way
you're going on this one?

53:01.569 --> 53:03.136
Death.

53:22.547 --> 53:24.592
Oh, we did the wrong hand.

53:24.636 --> 53:26.377
- It's a mirror.
- I'm sorry.

53:26.420 --> 53:27.726
Not whatever the fuck you want.

53:29.118 --> 53:32.339
- Do you wanna do improve?
- I don't know.

53:32.383 --> 53:34.775
- Are you just going to serve and protect you all life?
- I haven't even thought about

53:34.776 --> 53:37.257
that, I just thought
I had to do it.

53:37.301 --> 53:40.695
1072, we've got a 1016,
domestic disturbance in Upland.

53:40.739 --> 53:43.959
- Upland? We're not gonna go to Upland.
- Where's this?

53:44.003 --> 53:46.353
- Where is that?
- I'm not gonna get on the freeway.

53:46.397 --> 53:49.226
No, with this...
Oh, this operation?

53:49.269 --> 53:53.273
- I mean they should just... That whole city is meth.
- Oh...

53:53.317 --> 53:54.883
Now, what are we gonna do?

53:54.927 --> 53:56.667
If you wanna do what
you wanna do, just do it.

53:56.668 --> 53:58.321
- Choppers en route.
- I hate math.

53:58.322 --> 54:00.193
- Unit 72...
- I tell you that's not for me.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.370
- ...we need your assistance.
- Copy, dispatch, on our way.

54:03.414 --> 54:06.286
Oh, okay, so if the potatoes are
hot, it's a bad sign. Like if you...

54:06.330 --> 54:08.331
- You cool the potatoes.
- Yeah, then it's a cool potato.

54:08.332 --> 54:09.984
So if the potatoes are...
If they're hot and...

54:09.985 --> 54:11.638
- Your unit moving...
- Oh my God.

54:11.639 --> 54:13.423
- To suspect location.
- Can they find another...

54:13.424 --> 54:15.208
Copy, dispatch, on our way.

54:16.557 --> 54:18.211
- We'll be fine.
- It's fine.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.994
There's not a lot of traffic.
I know a back way.

54:19.995 --> 54:21.519
It's fine, we can go.
Okay, it's fine.

54:21.562 --> 54:24.304
You know what, macaroni
does better in the heat.

54:24.348 --> 54:28.047
- Oh, that's better.
- See, macaroni, you can eat 'cause it's just a dry pasta.

54:28.090 --> 54:30.004
- What is your ETA, Unit 72?
- You know what's happening

54:30.005 --> 54:32.007
now, potato salad
with olive oil?

54:32.051 --> 54:33.443
- We need to know you're en route.
- Oh, okay.

54:33.444 --> 54:35.097
I can't do that much,
that seems a lot.

54:35.141 --> 54:36.489
Inspector Reyes,
do you copy?

54:36.490 --> 54:38.971
Copy, dispatch,
five minutes away.

54:39.972 --> 54:43.889
- Huh.
- I think somebody else will get it right now.

54:43.932 --> 54:45.543
Oh, sometimes you just need

54:45.586 --> 54:48.676
to like sit
and assess what has happened.

54:48.720 --> 54:51.462
I repeat,
Brock and Reyes, please report.

54:51.505 --> 54:53.638
This better be
important, dispatch.

54:53.681 --> 54:55.770
Possible
casualties in this location,

54:55.814 --> 54:57.423
- suspects believed to be armed and dangerous.
- Let's roll.

54:57.424 --> 54:58.643
What about your callback?

55:00.471 --> 55:02.515
They'll just have to postpone the
shoot till we're done shooting.

55:02.516 --> 55:05.737
- I'm gonna write that down for a bumper sticker website.
- That's so good. Yeah.

55:05.780 --> 55:09.567
- Makes a lot of sense.
- Get the rest of that domain name.

55:09.610 --> 55:11.917
Yeah, uh, copswhoareactors.com.

55:11.960 --> 55:15.442
Yeah, www. Shooting... I'm shooting.
I never thought about that before.

55:15.486 --> 55:18.706
It's crazy, I'm
an actor with a gun.

55:21.405 --> 55:22.536
I should start the car.

55:32.764 --> 55:35.244
Oh, wait, guys. This isn't
the kind of message you wanna

55:35.288 --> 55:36.768
put out into
the universe, is it?

55:36.811 --> 55:38.900
We solve
discrepancies with murder?

55:38.944 --> 55:42.774
No, we hire someone HR, we
do some team building exercises.

55:43.644 --> 55:45.951
Isn't that the kind of business
you guys wanna get into?

55:45.994 --> 55:48.649
- Just give us the word, jefe.
- What the hell, Selene.

55:48.693 --> 55:50.171
I thought we had a good time
at the kidnapping.

55:50.172 --> 55:51.870
Aren't we all amigos and amigas?

55:51.913 --> 55:55.177
Selene, cut her throat on three.

55:55.221 --> 55:57.745
In English or Español?

55:57.789 --> 56:00.095
Please stop talking
so we can kill you.

56:00.139 --> 56:02.663
Sorry, I don't know proper
etiquette in this situation.

56:02.707 --> 56:05.362
One, dos.

56:06.537 --> 56:08.930
LAPD, we have you surrounded.

56:08.974 --> 56:10.627
Bitch, don't say anything
or I'll kill you.

56:10.628 --> 56:13.761
- No, no, no,.
- Motherfucking cops.

56:13.805 --> 56:17.417
They want a bloodbath? They're
gonna get a motherfucking bloodbath.

56:17.461 --> 56:19.331
- That's right.
- We don't know they want a bloodbath.

56:19.332 --> 56:21.203
Let's at least hear
what they have to say.

56:21.247 --> 56:22.770
Tonight is the night we all die.

56:22.814 --> 56:24.946
Let's brainstorm
some other ideas like

56:24.990 --> 56:28.776
- coming out with our hands up, what about that idea?
- No.

56:28.820 --> 56:32.214
- Los Gatos Robles will die before we surrender.
- That's right.

56:32.258 --> 56:34.128
You guys could easily
come up with another motto

56:34.129 --> 56:36.958
like, "Los Gatos Robles,
we surrender when we have to."

56:37.002 --> 56:38.762
Hands up, we're coming in.

56:42.486 --> 56:44.531
- Time to dance.
- I don't wanna dance.

56:45.924 --> 56:47.665
[]

57:22.439 --> 57:29.228
Hi, my name is Molly Reynolds. My friend
Atticus is being held captive. He's been shot.

57:29.271 --> 57:32.013
I don't even know if he's still
alive. If anyone sees this,

57:32.057 --> 57:35.060
please send help to
King Cobra Night Club.

57:38.977 --> 57:41.066
No motherfucking Wi-Fi?

57:41.109 --> 57:42.763
Goddammit.

57:42.807 --> 57:44.591
Fuck.

57:44.635 --> 57:46.854
Uh, shit.

58:19.234 --> 58:21.672
- Kaitlin!
- Where is he, Molly?

58:21.715 --> 58:24.152
Okay, Kaitlin.
I'm really glad you're here.

58:24.196 --> 58:27.765
- Atticus is in a shit storm of trouble right now.
- Oh, you bet your ass he is.

58:27.808 --> 58:30.463
You didn't think I could trace
your phone, did you? Well, I did.

58:30.507 --> 58:33.684
And that led me straight to you
and your titty on aggrandis.

58:33.727 --> 58:36.643
- Kaitlin, I swear, nothing ever happened.
- Oh, really? Huh?

58:36.687 --> 58:39.472
Atticus hasn't called me
in 15 hours and he's

58:39.516 --> 58:41.953
either always with you
or talking about you.

58:41.996 --> 58:44.346
Really? Like, what does he say?
Like, anything good?

58:44.390 --> 58:48.612
Oh, please. I know you guys
have been punani-pals for years.

58:48.655 --> 58:50.483
We have never been punani-pals.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.703
I swear, Kaitlin, on the code of women.

58:52.746 --> 58:55.227
- There's no such thing.
- Well, there should be.

58:55.270 --> 58:58.273
Us sisters got to stick together,
right? Femolution on three.

58:58.317 --> 59:00.362
Okay, not into
the femolution, fair enough.

59:00.406 --> 59:03.931
I know your game, Molly. You probably
did everything Atticus likes.

59:03.975 --> 59:07.020
You probably had a front row seat when
he did his penis on parade routine, huh?

59:07.021 --> 59:09.719
First of all, I hate parades and I
certainly won't invite a penis to one.

59:09.720 --> 59:13.985
Don't you dare make fun of me,
you... toe giddy hoe.

59:14.028 --> 59:16.640
Kaitlin, ouch, quiet your body.
Safe hands.

59:16.683 --> 59:19.730
Tell me you didn't let him play pat-a-cake,
pat-a-cake baker's crack, huh?

59:19.773 --> 59:22.210
No, we never played pat-a-cake,
pat-a-cake baker's crack.

59:22.254 --> 59:24.909
Liar, you loved the peekaboo
ballsack, I know you did.

59:24.952 --> 59:27.172
Never have I ever played
around with peekaboo ballsack.

59:27.215 --> 59:30.218
- You let him Peter Pan you.
- What's being Peter Paned?

59:30.262 --> 59:32.480
It's when you play with his
stinker bells until he flies.

59:32.481 --> 59:35.092
Ew, why do all these gross things
have confusing children's titles?

59:35.093 --> 59:36.790
Urgh, judgmental.

59:36.834 --> 59:39.140
From the woman who
probably made up the game

59:39.184 --> 59:41.578
If you're happy and you know
it, grab your ankles.

59:41.621 --> 59:43.928
- I hate that game.
- I don't wanna fight with you, okay.

59:43.971 --> 59:48.019
Just give this to the police. There's
everything they need to save Atticus.

59:50.151 --> 59:53.024
This isn't over.
Watch where you sleep.

59:53.067 --> 59:55.243
What?
What was that cryptic message?

59:55.287 --> 59:59.160
Kaitlin. Calm down.

59:59.204 --> 01:00:00.597
Kaitlin, you're breaking it.

01:00:02.207 --> 01:00:05.602
- Kaitlin, the femolution.
- Fuck the femolution.

01:00:08.169 --> 01:00:10.998
Kaitlin,
Atticus' blood is on your hands.

01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:15.524
Fuck you! Fuck you,
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:18.789
Oh, don't give me a middle finger,
I don't know what to do with that.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.647
I don't know, it's two
different things, Darren.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.648
Yeah, it's different things,
but it's like the same.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:53.809
Please, can I use your phone?

01:00:53.824 --> 01:00:55.564
- My phone?
- Oh.

01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:57.087
- Please it's an emergency.
- I don't...

01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.566
- Ma'am, I'm begging you.
- I know, but she's...

01:00:58.567 --> 01:01:00.700
- I don't know who she is.
- Babe, come on.

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:02.222
You, guys, I would not ask if
it's... Please, can I use your phone?

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:03.746
- Oh my gosh.
- Just give her your phone.

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:05.225
Thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:01:05.226 --> 01:01:06.749
- It's fine, I know.
- It's fine for now.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.491
- Hello 911.
- 911, what's your emergency?

01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:11.319
Yes, I'd like
to report a kidnapping.

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:13.974
- Okay, what's the age of your child?
- 32.

01:01:14.018 --> 01:01:17.456
- You've got an old ass baby.
- No, he's an adult.

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:19.371
Okay, well,
then you need missing persons.

01:01:19.414 --> 01:01:21.286
How long has it been
since he left you?

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:23.549
He didn't leave me,
he was taken.

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:26.247
Has it been over 72 hours
since he took off?

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:30.121
It's been 23 hours, and again
he didn't leave me, alright?

01:01:30.164 --> 01:01:32.123
A man can be taken
against his will.

01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:33.906
Or at least that's what
he can say the next morning.

01:01:33.907 --> 01:01:36.344
Can I get an amen on that? Whoa!

01:01:36.388 --> 01:01:38.651
My best friend
has been abducted.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.045
Please hold for
Agents Mulder and Sculley.

01:01:41.088 --> 01:01:42.742
What? What?

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:45.266
No, no, no, no,
no not in a spaceship.

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:46.659
He's at King Cobra Nightclub.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.270
Hmm, mystery solved,
case closed, bye.

01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:51.968
If you don't help me, my best friend
is probably going to be murdered.

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:53.753
Probably going to be murdered.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:56.669
Please hold for Tom Cruise
and future crimes division.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:02:01.195
Sir, I really need
you to send the police, okay?

01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:04.242
Listen, ma'am, unless there's
a crime that's been committed

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:06.766
or one that's in progress,
you know, I just can't help you.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.073
Me, me,
I'm the crime in progress.

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:12.380
I'm a thief,
a con artist, a drug dealer.

01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:14.992
Yeah, and I'm Jeffrey Dahmer.
Girl, bye.

01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:16.994
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Sir, please.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:18.299
No, honey, please.

01:02:18.343 --> 01:02:20.214
I would not make this up, okay?

01:02:20.258 --> 01:02:22.651
I've had the worst day
you can imagine.

01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:24.958
I've been kidnapped,
I've been robbed, I've

01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:27.613
been open palm slapped
across the face.

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.789
I've lost
everything, everything.

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:32.923
- All I have left is my friend Atticus.
- I told you.

01:02:32.966 --> 01:02:35.360
Now after 72 hours,
you can file a missing

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:38.493
person's report if your man
has not come back to you.

01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:41.018
He didn't leave me, he
didn't cheat on me, alright?

01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:43.063
He followed me into a life
of crime for God's sake.

01:02:43.107 --> 01:02:45.152
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:46.716
You're not sending
the police, are you?

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:47.720
Nope.

01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:50.897
Fuck, fuck it,
I'll do it myself.

01:02:53.073 --> 01:02:54.814
- Thanks, guys. I'm sorry about that.
- Hey.

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.815
- Do you need anything?
- Can you guys give me a ride?

01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:59.123
- Yeah.
- Yeah. -Thank you.

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:03.692
I'm saying we sell what we have,

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.433
and then we make
enough money to retire.

01:03:05.477 --> 01:03:07.827
One last deal? That's worked?

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:10.569
In the history of anything,
has one last deal ever worked?

01:03:10.612 --> 01:03:12.397
I'm telling this
is a bad idea, Atticus.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.573
All I'm saying, Molly,
is these pills, you can

01:03:14.616 --> 01:03:17.358
get 25 bucks each for them
and we have over 500 pills.

01:03:17.402 --> 01:03:20.492
Okay, well, clearly, I'm the only
one who is thinking about our future.

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:22.929
Our future, yours and mine
or yours and Kaitlin's?

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.932
- Uh...
- Yeah, okay, well, whatever.

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:27.064
Mixed signals.

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:32.896
- Mary Jane? Liz?
- Um, no.

01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:34.898
Sorry.
I need to get in there, please.

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.681
- Right now. I know, sir, it's urgent.
- Yo, what's this about?

01:03:36.682 --> 01:03:38.815
Well, you need to wait
in line like everybody else.

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.598
- I cannot wait in line. I'm sorry. I can't wait in line.
- Yo, yo, yo.

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.906
- This is an emergency, sir.
- You just cut the line.

01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:45.473
- I'm on there, uh, Jennifer, uh.
- No, no Jennifer here.

01:03:45.517 --> 01:03:47.953
- There's no Jennifer.
- Oh, my friend called in that's probably why.

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:49.912
- She didn't put my last name.
- Yes, I'm sorry. Hey, I need some help out here, man.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:52.916
- Listen, we got a... we got a crazy one.
- What's going on?

01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:54.831
This is not...
No, I'm not crazy, sir.

01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:56.614
I have a friend in there
that I need to urgently see.

01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:58.660
- Name?
- Jennifer.

01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:00.966
- The name's not on the list.
- But it might not be under Jennifer.

01:04:00.967 --> 01:04:04.753
- It may not be on the list.
- No 'cause my friend Christine or, uh, Marcus.

01:04:04.797 --> 01:04:06.233
- Or?
- You guys, please.

01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:07.320
No, unless...
You're gonna have to move.

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:08.496
You're gonna have to move.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.542
You are gonna have to move.

01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:12.283
I don't have time for this shit.

01:04:14.415 --> 01:04:16.940
- Shit.
- Maybe she could go in.

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:23.076
We're good? You good? Thank you.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.904
You're welcome.

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:26.166
See, if it wasn't for that,

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:28.647
you know, I wouldn't let her in.

01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:48.422
- Molly, are you okay?
- Do I look okay, Boo?

01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:49.989
- Where is my teapot?
- It's here.

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.556
It's right here
in my backpack and I'm

01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:53.340
really happy to
give it back to you.

01:05:54.472 --> 01:05:57.170
Again, we are so sorry
about all of this.

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:59.520
- Really super sorry.
- You don't have our pills?

01:05:59.564 --> 01:06:03.089
- You don't have our pills. Burn them.
- Burn?

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:06.397
- No, wait, that's... that's really extreme.
- Yeah, can't you just like

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.443
- let us off with a stern warning or something?
- The time I gave you is up.

01:06:09.487 --> 01:06:11.532
I don't wanna die.
Oh, God, please.

01:06:11.576 --> 01:06:13.447
Sir, I tried to get you your
drugs back,

01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:15.101
just selling drugs
is really hard.

01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:17.408
- Yeah, it only looks easy.
- And it's not.

01:06:17.451 --> 01:06:20.018
We should have left it to the experts.
We're really, really sorry.

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.977
I've been dragged through
the underbelly of Los Angeles,

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.980
isn't my emotional
scarring enough?

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:25.416
I don't think so.

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:26.765
Physical scar will do.

01:06:26.808 --> 01:06:28.027
Keep going, guys.

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:30.029
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:32.509
- Molly, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, for what, getting us burned alive?

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.728
- Don't worry about it.
- Uh, sir, you don't have to do this.

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:36.035
Please, just let Molly go.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:39.125
Oh, how sweet, makes me cry.

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:42.563
Oh, wait, that's just a fumes from
your burning carcasses.

01:06:42.607 --> 01:06:45.001
Sir, if you let us go,
we will do anything you want.

01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:48.004
What I want is to have
you burn for fucking my asshole.

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:49.875
Sir, we never meant
to fuck your asshole.

01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:51.746
- Not once.
- Never.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.487
Give me something to drink.

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:56.664
I want to make a toast to
these two being burned alive.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:59.450
- By the way, I got jumped by your crazy bitch girlfriend.
- What?

01:06:59.493 --> 01:07:01.321
- You guys are a bunch of pervs.
- What?

01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:03.323
Yeah, she told me all
about being Peter Panned

01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:06.065
and how she played with your
stinker bell, a bunch of pervs.

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:09.851
- What the fuck's stinker bell?
- I never wanted to do this. I hated doing that... at first.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.899
What? What things?
You guys are sick.

01:07:13.942 --> 01:07:16.727
Good thing we never hooked up, otherwise, I'd
have to come up with rules and regulations

01:07:16.728 --> 01:07:20.297
- for capturing the butthole.
- You'd do that for me?

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.820
The fact that I even came up with a
point system for capturing the butthole,

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:25.041
probably says a little bit about
how I feel about you.

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:26.781
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:29.045
'Cause you had a girlfriend.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:31.438
Fuck, Molly,
you should have said something.

01:07:31.482 --> 01:07:34.006
- Kaitlin sucks.
- I told you Kaitlin sucks.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.269
I told you in so many
subtle ways Kaitlin sucks.

01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:37.488
Why did you stay with her?

01:07:37.531 --> 01:07:39.359
I don't know, she liked me

01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:41.123
and I never thought
I had a chance with you.

01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:47.193
I love you, Molly, and I never said anything
because I thought you'd push me away,

01:07:47.237 --> 01:07:50.457
and I wouldn't get to work with
you and I'd lose you forever.

01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:53.852
Alright, well, I don't wanna die
without telling you I love you too.

01:07:53.895 --> 01:07:55.455
I mean, as much as
I'm capable of loving

01:07:55.462 --> 01:07:57.856
someone, I know that isn't much.

01:07:57.899 --> 01:07:58.944
It's enough.

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:06.473
I would like to propose a toast.

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:10.521
Here's to you
and your trip to hell.

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:20.661
I don't feel so good.

01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:21.880
Hold that.

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.837
God.

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:30.627
- Help me!
- Help him already.

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:33.457
Get off your assholes and do something.
That's what we paid you to do.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.849
If you let us go,
we'll help him.

01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:37.156
Do it. Hurry.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.862
Let this man go.

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.131
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:58.134
Holy shit,
what the hell happened?

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:20.243
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:22.113 --> 01:09:25.987
- You did it.
- We did it. We did it.

01:09:33.734 --> 01:09:36.520
Senior molestation is not okay.

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:38.912
No.

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.087
No.

01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:55.713
That felt good. That felt like...
That felt better.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:56.931
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:56.975 --> 01:09:58.716
Okay. No, it was great.

01:09:58.759 --> 01:10:00.457
This part was
really, really great.

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:07.768
Um, you just seem so nervous.

01:10:07.812 --> 01:10:10.815
Excuse me, I should've
had my coffee. Oh.

01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:14.688
So, uh,
what do you all think of this?

01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:23.610
Movie night was a big bust.

01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:26.309
I told you we shoulda
gone with Magic Mike XL,

01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:28.702
it's a masterpiece with
a good story arc, pendejos.

01:10:28.746 --> 01:10:29.790
Yeah, Si.

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:37.362
I just said to someone, "Hey,
man, I need a D," and he's like,

01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:39.278
"Well, I need a D too."
And I'd know exactly

01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:40.932
what the fuck
he's talking about.

01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:42.975
I'm talking about diapers,
he's talking about dick.

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:49.941
- You'll find someone special.
- No.

01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:51.203
- Yeah.
- No.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.160
There's a girl out there

01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:53.161
who's just dying to

01:10:53.205 --> 01:10:55.207
grapefruit you.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.556
- Really.
- Yeah.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.037
Rodney could
find a girl like that.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.430
A real grapefruiter.

01:11:09.482 --> 01:11:11.049
Hang it.

01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:12.702
Good, good, good,
there, yeah, that's beautiful.

01:11:12.703 --> 01:11:14.574
That's perfect like that,
except now,

01:11:14.618 --> 01:11:17.055
I want you to get
really comfortable, okay?

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.802
They wouldn't be
parading around in the light.

01:11:24.845 --> 01:11:26.194
No, no, I guess they wouldn't.

01:11:26.238 --> 01:11:28.501
Yeah, element of surprise.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:50.088
- Yeah.
- Atticus.

01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:52.264
Did you see my friend,
he was right here?

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.485
Atticus, Scout,
Pirelli, Atticus.

01:11:55.528 --> 01:11:57.648
Okay, very good. We've all seen
To Kill A Mockingbird.

01:12:05.146 --> 01:12:07.584
Yeah, I got
your card, thank you.

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:09.542
I feel somethin" a little
different in here.

01:12:09.586 --> 01:12:11.326
I don't know what it is,
but I'm kinda stoked.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.589
- Yeah.
- I feel good about it.

01:12:18.769 --> 01:12:22.338
You should have never sold your
shit in Gato Roble's territory.

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:24.862
I know. A total puta.

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:26.385
I couldn't agree more
and you guys are

01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.387
angry, and you
really should be angry.

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:30.476
I'd be angry too like,
"Oh, here's this puta."

01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:39.267
You let motherfucking strangers
in my place of business?

01:12:41.095 --> 01:12:42.358
We had to.

01:12:43.837 --> 01:12:46.318
What the fuck are you twatholes
standing around for?

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.407
Find them, go.

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:49.713
Jesus Christ.

01:12:58.678 --> 01:13:01.377
Hold on a second. Ma, ma?

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:04.336
Hey, you got my shit?

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.164
What shit, honey?

01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:07.407
Did you clean down here today?

01:13:08.645 --> 01:13:10.211
I told you not
to touch my stuff.

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:12.823
Honey, I've got to
Dethaw the lasagne.

01:13:12.866 --> 01:13:14.564
Alright, I'm getting hungry.

01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:16.217
Working on my appetite.

01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:17.701
Killing
motherfuckers left and right.

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:26.793
So you should have a grapefruit that
has two sides missing just like this.

01:13:26.837 --> 01:13:28.839
Now what you're gonna do
is you're gonna put a hole

01:13:28.882 --> 01:13:31.624
at the middle of the grapefruit
approximately the size...

01:13:31.668 --> 01:13:33.365
- Yeah, nice.
- ...that you're gonna do.

01:13:39.327 --> 01:13:40.590
You know she religious?

01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:43.462
She's taking this
straight to Mountain High.

01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:07.443
Uh, this is
pretty much your job now.

01:14:07.486 --> 01:14:09.270
Alright,
there you go, right there.

01:14:17.931 --> 01:14:19.280
That's okay,
you don't need to...

01:14:19.324 --> 01:14:20.238
There's an old lady...

01:14:20.281 --> 01:14:21.500
...stink up my car.

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:23.371
...just waiting for him.

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:25.809
He's just waving his arms.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:27.374
Please not... Please
let's not signal for him.

01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:28.420
Yeah.

01:14:31.641 --> 01:14:35.427
You know in combat, they taught
me a little bit about torture.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:40.127
What you're going to get right now, my
friend is a non-stop dose of Fox News.

01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:42.782
Oh, God, no, hang on.

01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:48.309
People are...
Oh, this is so disingenuous.

01:14:51.356 --> 01:14:52.792
D2, take the mark.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:02.585
- Wait for the plane.
- I hear something.

01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:05.544
- Yeah, I do hear something.
- Or the motorcycles.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.508
Butter.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:14.988
Stay off my butter.

01:15:16.337 --> 01:15:18.097
Let's swiftly talk
about how annoyed...

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:35.008
You've been
paying for me... Bring

01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:38.055
your fucking-your
fucking legs so I can fuck.

01:15:38.098 --> 01:15:42.363
And I'll shit...
I'll shit on that skull

01:15:42.407 --> 01:15:43.974
and I'll keep on fucking it.

01:15:44.017 --> 01:15:46.280
I'll lube up on it,
the fucking shit.

01:15:46.324 --> 01:15:48.413
I don't care. I got nothing.

01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:53.592
The pills
you took the other night?

01:15:53.636 --> 01:15:58.466
And you need to...
You need to help... I'm sorry.

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:01.861
I'm sorry.

01:16:01.905 --> 01:16:03.559
Right here, son.

01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:04.602
Right here.

01:16:08.738 --> 01:16:10.348
Just, uh, take your time there.

01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:15.222
Just take it nice,
take it slow, hold on there.

01:16:15.266 --> 01:16:17.007
Just getting ready.

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:19.836
Uh, just get the tip real nice.

01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:23.317
This is the top of the fruit you
can see right there, very versatile.

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:24.405
Sure.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.582
Oh, yeah.

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:31.848
One, dos.

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:34.590
Can someone call
Chris Hansen because

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:38.115
I'm destroying
your 13-year-old ass.
