WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.942
Previously, on Dracula...

00:04.373 --> 00:05.695
Marry me.

00:06.036 --> 00:07.207
Things will never be the same.

00:07.256 --> 00:09.118
You are to be married, and that is that.

00:09.169 --> 00:11.601
How long must I spend
skulking in the shadows?

00:11.651 --> 00:13.722
I want to walk in the
sun like any other man.

00:14.943 --> 00:18.046
Not until I've done further tests
on the blood I took from you.

00:18.907 --> 00:20.410
These cells are alive.

00:20.460 --> 00:21.730
I want you to find out everything

00:21.780 --> 00:22.932
about this General Shaw.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.853
He's a powerful ally of my competitors.

00:25.665 --> 00:27.897
These are General
Shaw's personal accounts.

00:27.947 --> 00:29.918
General Shaw is taking bribes.

00:29.969 --> 00:31.661
My intention was to embarrass the man.

00:31.710 --> 00:33.823
You're not suggesting I
just let this go, are you?

00:33.872 --> 00:35.254
Mr. Grayson.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.106
The privilege of the first dance.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.990
You wish to employ my services

00:41.039 --> 00:44.593
in order to get Mr. Renfield
to answer one question.

00:45.074 --> 00:48.477
Who does Grayson love?

02:24.191 --> 02:26.233
Vampires don't promenade about,

02:26.283 --> 02:28.736
attending balls and running businesses.

02:29.476 --> 02:31.718
They are creatures of night and shadow.

02:31.768 --> 02:33.371
My point precisely.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.803
In all the months
Grayson's lived in London,

02:35.854 --> 02:38.457
he has yet to attend a
single event in daylight.

02:39.567 --> 02:40.288
Well, if that were the proof,

02:40.288 --> 02:42.670
I'd have to hunt half
the titled cads in london.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.072
Then consider those who
oppose his interests.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.505
Sir Clive, killed by a wolf.

02:47.555 --> 02:49.797
Lord Laurent, persuaded
to forfeit his company

02:49.847 --> 02:51.348
at the cost of his life.

02:51.398 --> 02:53.311
Meanwhile, the man develops a technology

02:53.361 --> 02:54.522
which, if successful,

02:54.522 --> 02:57.635
will render our investments in
the Ottoman oil fields worthless.

02:57.685 --> 03:00.057
I understand your concerns,
Mr. Browning, I do,

03:00.108 --> 03:04.862
but I've spent a great deal
of time with Mr. Grayson,

03:05.153 --> 03:06.613
and I can assure you
as your head huntsman,

03:06.663 --> 03:09.276
I would have noticed if
the man were nosferatu.

03:10.937 --> 03:12.269
Thomas, you've been
looking into the man.

03:12.319 --> 03:13.610
What do you make of him?

03:13.660 --> 03:17.555
Well, I must say, I do share
your concerns, Mr. Browning.

03:17.605 --> 03:19.497
Based on what evidence?

03:19.566 --> 03:21.969
Oh, nothing specific, purely instinct.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.372
Shall I probe further?

03:24.422 --> 03:26.513
No, that won't be necessary.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.706
I know a way to flush out
the beast, once and for all.

03:52.719 --> 03:53.520
Thank you.

03:53.571 --> 03:54.380
Oh, Winston,

03:54.431 --> 03:59.086
a little bird tells me you have
a case of 1811 Chateau Margaux.

03:59.136 --> 04:00.146
I do, madame.

04:03.620 --> 04:06.412
Oh, Alexander, you must
try this, it's exquisite.

04:07.593 --> 04:08.556
Of course.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.217
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

04:14.761 --> 04:17.293
A single playing card,

04:17.343 --> 04:20.486
folded elegantly down the center

04:21.648 --> 04:25.071
and torn into two pieces,

04:25.121 --> 04:29.195
shown on the front and the back.

04:29.245 --> 04:32.218
Now, watch very
carefully, 'cause your eyes

04:32.268 --> 04:33.499
will deceive you.

04:35.581 --> 04:37.023
That's extraordinary.

04:37.073 --> 04:39.965
Yes, the soup julienne is extraordinary.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.348
So I should have that,
and so should you, Mina.

04:42.508 --> 04:43.980
I'm sorry, darling,

04:43.990 --> 04:46.763
but I don't know how someone so bright

04:46.763 --> 04:49.765
can enjoy something as
simpleminded as parlor magic.

04:50.355 --> 04:51.516
So how's it done, then?

04:51.566 --> 04:52.749
It's simple, really.

04:53.630 --> 04:55.121
Why, Mr. Grayson.

04:55.361 --> 04:57.984
You have a gift for
making london seem small.

04:59.054 --> 05:02.127
Miss Murray, you're looking
lovely tonight, as ever.

05:03.149 --> 05:04.470
Permit me to explain.

05:05.721 --> 05:07.742
The card is folded down the middle

05:08.695 --> 05:11.377
and is torn, but not the whole way.

05:11.998 --> 05:15.001
It is folded back in
itself, and you mime...

05:15.830 --> 05:17.303
tearing the card in half...

05:17.843 --> 05:20.546
Good heavens.
- So it appears to be torn.

05:21.227 --> 05:22.278
But really,

05:23.149 --> 05:24.590
it's still in one place.

05:25.441 --> 05:26.992
The rest is purely theater.

05:29.875 --> 05:31.577
That's very good, isn't it, Jonathan?

05:31.868 --> 05:33.829
Yes, quite.
- Yes.

05:33.879 --> 05:35.760
If business should ever prove fruitless,

05:35.811 --> 05:37.933
you might very well enjoy
a future on the stage.

05:38.424 --> 05:39.846
Now, if you'll excuse me.

05:48.954 --> 05:51.926
Well, I appear to have
been abandoned by Alexander.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.789
I'm sure he'll be back
when he's done showing off.

05:53.838 --> 05:55.380
Oh, I have no doubt.

05:55.431 --> 05:59.064
Darling, would you pop in
for tea at mine tomorrow?

05:59.114 --> 06:00.765
It's just I feel we
have so much in common,

06:00.815 --> 06:03.107
it would be a sin not to get
to know each other better.

06:04.069 --> 06:05.780
Yes, of course. I'd love to.

06:05.831 --> 06:08.594
See, I-I also know what it's like

06:08.643 --> 06:10.665
to be denied one's heart's desire.

06:12.228 --> 06:14.790
I have no interest whatsoever
in Alexander Grayson.

06:14.839 --> 06:16.231
I'm not talking about him.

06:27.292 --> 06:29.133
I'd like to apologize

06:29.183 --> 06:31.597
for leaving your engagement
party so abruptly.

06:31.646 --> 06:34.469
I'd hate to think either of
you inferred a personal slight

06:34.519 --> 06:37.332
or a diminution of my fondness
towards you as a couple.

06:38.804 --> 06:42.186
For you, Harker, are the king of hearts,

06:45.110 --> 06:48.874
and you, Mina, the queen.

06:52.276 --> 06:55.700
And even if an evil, little jester

06:55.750 --> 06:57.572
tries to come between you...

07:03.018 --> 07:05.219
He cannot sever your bond.

07:15.249 --> 07:19.403
Winston, please see to it that
my friends get the very best,

07:19.453 --> 07:20.844
on my account.

07:26.121 --> 07:29.974
Now, shall we see just how
much of Mr. Grayson's fortune

07:29.974 --> 07:31.626
we can drink in a single night?

07:36.160 --> 07:36.980
Let's.

07:39.573 --> 07:40.575
Winston!

08:04.068 --> 08:06.179
May I take your shawl, my Queen?

08:06.229 --> 08:08.061
You may, my king.

08:09.903 --> 08:11.434
How was your promenade?

08:11.485 --> 08:16.470
Oh, spoilt by too much rain,
thus requiring your assistance.

08:21.144 --> 08:22.955
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:38.521 --> 09:39.612
Are you sure?

10:39.601 --> 10:41.110
I've been thinking.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.100
About?

10:46.658 --> 10:48.139
We should elope.

10:51.458 --> 10:52.937
Elope?

10:55.037 --> 10:56.396
Makes sense.

10:57.376 --> 11:00.085
Why go through the
trouble of a formal wedding

11:00.135 --> 11:02.405
when we could just be together?

11:03.286 --> 11:05.414
Just you and me as we are?

11:09.494 --> 11:12.652
Do you honestly feel that
what we did last night

11:12.702 --> 11:14.932
makes our vows any less sacred?

11:16.581 --> 11:18.721
No. No, of course not.

11:21.350 --> 11:23.710
Then we should get married in a church

11:23.760 --> 11:26.769
before god and our family
and all of our friends.

11:30.608 --> 11:33.727
Of course. We'll set a date.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.663
What are you doing tonight?

11:51.223 --> 11:53.032
I'm due at university.

11:55.062 --> 11:59.380
I see, so I'm playing second fiddle
to your work with Dr. Van Helsing.

12:14.196 --> 12:15.157
You're late.

12:20.256 --> 12:21.784
Nickel-steel alloy,

12:21.834 --> 12:23.745
60% lighter than regular steel

12:23.795 --> 12:25.973
with amazing
heat-transference properties.

12:26.023 --> 12:27.404
Non-magnetic, as well.

12:27.454 --> 12:29.543
The answer to our
resonated casing problem.

12:29.593 --> 12:30.763
Very good, Harker.

12:31.313 --> 12:33.431
I don't suppose you can tell
me the foundries in England

12:33.481 --> 12:35.830
with expertise in nickel-steel alloy.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.180
Trick question.

12:37.231 --> 12:40.460
There's only one,
and Renfield found it.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.529
Empire and Colonial Metallurgy.

12:44.449 --> 12:47.378
Now, it's owned by one Ewan Telford III.

12:47.428 --> 12:48.688
He's American.

12:48.738 --> 12:51.387
Old money, Boston blueblood.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.827
His family is in shipping.

12:52.877 --> 12:55.226
Besides dabbling in business,

12:55.276 --> 12:59.605
it seems Ewan has a fanatical
interest in all things Wild West.

13:00.725 --> 13:02.425
Cowboys and Indians?

13:02.475 --> 13:05.403
Outlaws, six-guns, fallen women.

13:06.104 --> 13:09.742
And most interestingly,
poker, five-card draw,

13:09.793 --> 13:12.212
all comers welcome
with unlimited stakes.

13:12.263 --> 13:15.771
And it just so happens he
has a game this evening.

13:15.821 --> 13:17.060
Does he, now?

13:17.921 --> 13:19.871
Excellent work, Mr. Harker.

13:20.139 --> 13:21.379
Renfield.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.059
Good to see you on the mend.

13:24.109 --> 13:26.559
Have the police made any
headway on your attackers?

13:26.609 --> 13:28.328
I'm sorry to say no.

13:28.498 --> 13:30.898
I'm told this type of gang
attack is all too common

13:30.948 --> 13:32.507
on your east side.

13:32.557 --> 13:36.516
It's hard to believe that
they'd attack a man your size.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.614
A measure of their desperation.

13:38.875 --> 13:39.935
Clearly.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.004
I suppose I should be grateful
they didn't take my life as well.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.813
Time, after all, heals all wounds.

13:47.733 --> 13:48.783
Not all.

13:49.563 --> 13:50.382
True, sir.

13:51.092 --> 13:54.831
But there are still things we
can do to lessen their sting.

14:08.507 --> 14:10.487
Harker, can you excuse us for a moment?

14:10.887 --> 14:13.787
Now.
- Of course.

14:21.564 --> 14:22.684
You found it.

14:22.734 --> 14:25.233
Yes, sir, the Dresden Triptych.

14:26.502 --> 14:29.403
Ah, the Dresden Triptych, eh?

14:29.612 --> 14:32.621
15th century, Romanian baroque.

14:33.442 --> 14:36.801
We intercepted a telegram from his
man, Renfield, to the auction house.

14:36.851 --> 14:39.300
Seems that for 12 years,

14:39.350 --> 14:43.309
Grayson has employed agents all over
the globe in search of this triptych.

14:43.359 --> 14:45.058
The auction is next week.

14:47.018 --> 14:48.678
Good work, Mr. Cameron.

14:48.727 --> 14:52.957
Hackett, get me this Dresden triptych.

14:53.007 --> 14:56.005
If Mr. Grayson wants it, then so do I.

15:01.194 --> 15:02.634
Your bet, Mr. Grayson.

15:12.152 --> 15:13.131
I fold.

15:15.670 --> 15:16.630
Fold.

15:17.260 --> 15:18.260
Three 10s.

15:22.109 --> 15:25.129
Mr. Grayson, you have played
this game before, correct?

15:25.558 --> 15:28.828
I have, Mr. Telford, many times.

15:29.377 --> 15:31.586
Well, I certainly wouldn't
know it by your timidity, sir.

15:32.186 --> 15:34.106
You've folded nine straight hands.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.505
The cards weren't to my liking.

15:36.845 --> 15:39.725
And yet you bet recklessly on them
right up until the very last round.

15:41.164 --> 15:44.503
I've just about cleaned you out without
seeing a single one of your cards.

15:46.693 --> 15:47.692
Just about.

16:07.003 --> 16:08.453
How was your evening, sir?

16:10.482 --> 16:12.402
I suspect Mr. Ewan Telford III

16:12.452 --> 16:14.581
is busy trying to explain
to his mummy and daddy

16:14.631 --> 16:16.591
how he lost his business in a card game.

16:18.819 --> 16:21.998
The annual stockholder meeting
for British Imperial Coolant

16:22.048 --> 16:23.699
has been rescheduled.

16:23.749 --> 16:27.288
Instead of Friday evening,
it'll be held at noon.

16:32.985 --> 16:36.694
In the solarium, in
the middle of the day.

16:37.554 --> 16:40.113
Send my regrets.
- Sir, as chairman,

16:40.163 --> 16:43.151
you must attend or risk a proxy vote,

16:43.201 --> 16:45.521
which will remove you
as head of the company.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.511
Lose control, and you lose the Coolant.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.199
Damn Van Helsing!

16:53.039 --> 16:55.828
I told him to delay our
plan to avenge the order

16:55.878 --> 16:57.627
until he perfected the serum.

16:58.107 --> 17:00.667
Now I lose my company or burn.

17:03.906 --> 17:04.784
Damn!

17:57.268 --> 18:00.166
What is this? Why is it hidden away?

18:24.339 --> 18:26.067
What in the world was I thinking?

18:52.409 --> 18:55.219
Thank you for agreeing to
meet with me, Miss Westenra.

18:57.808 --> 19:00.127
I didn't mean to
embarrass you at the savoy.

19:01.247 --> 19:05.776
It's just, when I saw the manner

19:05.825 --> 19:08.835
in which you were gazing
at Miss Murray, I...

19:10.444 --> 19:13.164
I felt like I was peering
into a looking glass.

19:16.142 --> 19:18.381
Oh. Dear girl.

19:18.971 --> 19:21.300
Oh, don't be frightened.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.219
I mean, surely Minerva--
surely your mother told you

19:26.269 --> 19:28.738
how commonplace these urges are.

19:33.007 --> 19:33.856
No.

19:34.337 --> 19:35.587
Why, yes, of course.

19:35.636 --> 19:39.135
They're a perfectly natural
part of a woman's maturation.

19:39.943 --> 19:41.863
I myself had several female lovers

19:41.914 --> 19:43.782
before I ever conjugated with a man.

19:46.593 --> 19:47.282
Really?

19:49.212 --> 19:52.570
These--these longings
are not unusual.

19:54.279 --> 19:58.028
In fact, Mina likely feels
the same way about you.

20:00.988 --> 20:02.277
She's never uttered a word.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.606
Neither have you.

20:05.306 --> 20:08.336
See, women have many secret ways

20:08.386 --> 20:10.225
of expressing desire.

20:11.884 --> 20:15.963
It's a touch of the hand, gentle hug...

20:20.671 --> 20:21.931
Stolen glance.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.710
The hints abound.

20:35.416 --> 20:38.575
Mina, no doubt, is too afraid
to unveil her heart to you,

20:38.625 --> 20:40.625
but the next time she gives you a hint,

20:40.675 --> 20:42.164
assume the burden.

20:43.423 --> 20:45.054
Tell her how you feel.

20:52.331 --> 20:53.340
What is this?

20:54.700 --> 20:57.989
We owe the failure of
the last serum experiments

20:58.039 --> 21:00.817
to the viscosity of vampiric blood.

21:01.578 --> 21:04.278
The heart alone cannot
generate the pressure necessary

21:04.278 --> 21:07.477
to force the serum into the capillaries.

21:07.477 --> 21:08.636
This can.

21:08.636 --> 21:11.665
We'll be ready to test on
a new subject in a few days.

21:17.572 --> 21:18.573
No.

21:19.232 --> 21:22.561
You will test it tomorrow, on me.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.349
I must let you get back to your lab and
ensure your calculations are correct.

21:28.209 --> 21:30.888
Tomorrow, Van Helsing. Tomorrow.

21:37.370 --> 21:41.288
I thought I told you specifically
to keep this to yourself!

21:42.358 --> 21:45.497
I had no choice. General
Shaw is a traitor.

21:45.827 --> 21:49.296
You know, I admire
your patriotism, Harker.

21:49.296 --> 21:51.793
If anyone should even
suspect that I had anything

21:51.803 --> 21:53.624
to do with this
- They won't.

21:53.953 --> 21:54.833
I was very discreet.

21:54.833 --> 21:59.530
It was a friend of a friend
of an old contact at the times.

21:59.530 --> 22:02.399
The story will never come
back to me, let alone you.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.129
You see that it doesn't.

22:20.043 --> 22:21.612
You're certain it was Mr. Renfield?

22:21.612 --> 22:24.211
I got a good look at him.
It was him, all right.

22:24.402 --> 22:25.800
Did he identify himself?

22:25.800 --> 22:27.770
No, sir, I saw him before.

22:27.859 --> 22:30.918
It was Grayson's man, the
large, black gentleman.

22:31.159 --> 22:33.767
I saw him handing money to
a woman called Vera Markham,

22:33.777 --> 22:35.916
heard him say Mr. Grayson
would spare no expense

22:35.916 --> 22:38.066
to keep her identity secret.

22:42.253 --> 22:44.752
The order thanks you for
your service, Mr. Dewhurst.

22:46.082 --> 22:48.152
"Spare no expense."

22:49.711 --> 22:51.820
Find out about this Vera Markham

22:51.820 --> 22:54.869
And why Grayson might have
reason to be paying her off.

22:55.318 --> 22:56.998
By legal means, sir?

22:57.509 --> 22:59.187
By any means necessary.

23:26.736 --> 23:27.926
What are you doing?

23:28.925 --> 23:29.965
Professor.

23:33.643 --> 23:35.062
That will be all, miss Murray.

23:35.062 --> 23:37.412
I no longer require your assistance.

23:39.461 --> 23:42.399
You're discharging me.
- That will be all.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.699
I conducted an experiment
by adding this substance

24:04.699 --> 24:08.679
to human cheek cells, and
the dead cells reanimated.

24:08.769 --> 24:09.628
That's not possible.

24:09.628 --> 24:13.567
No, I repeated the experiment,
and the results were identical.

24:20.783 --> 24:22.023
Have a seat.

24:29.781 --> 24:32.859
Your mind is impossible
to contain, miss Murray.

24:35.348 --> 24:39.456
Unfortunately, enthusiasm
does not always lend itself

24:39.456 --> 24:41.745
to accurate results.

24:42.714 --> 24:45.443
This substance you found

24:46.644 --> 24:48.173
is actually an inert medium

24:48.173 --> 24:51.182
containing a microscopic parasite

24:51.522 --> 24:56.419
I obtained in Sumatra.

24:56.459 --> 24:59.288
I would have observed living organisms.

24:59.477 --> 25:01.517
Normally, yes, but these creatures

25:01.517 --> 25:05.286
are too small to be observed,
even with a microscope.

25:05.766 --> 25:09.334
No, I-I don't see how...
- So you see, my dear,

25:09.904 --> 25:13.123
what you call "reanimation"
is nothing more

25:13.123 --> 25:15.932
than the effect of cells being attacked

25:15.932 --> 25:19.850
by thousands of voracious parasites.

25:27.387 --> 25:28.717
I apologize.

25:28.717 --> 25:29.855
The truth is,

25:29.855 --> 25:34.344
my mother died when I was very young.

25:36.353 --> 25:37.792
I'm sorry.

25:38.472 --> 25:41.071
Cancer of the stomach.

25:49.637 --> 25:52.137
You wish to cure cancer?

25:53.666 --> 25:54.745
No.

25:57.445 --> 26:00.654
I wish to cure death.

26:08.940 --> 26:11.789
So you've read Dr. Freud's latest papers

26:11.789 --> 26:16.507
and his theory on a phenomena
he calls "projection."

26:16.507 --> 26:20.895
By which objective
observation is distorted--

26:20.905 --> 26:23.525
By subjective desire, yes.

26:27.293 --> 26:30.382
I am sorry I wasted your time.

26:54.731 --> 26:56.951
The allegations still
need to be proven in court.

26:56.951 --> 26:59.680
The gutter press have already
handed down their verdict.

27:00.639 --> 27:02.638
Shaw is useless to us now.

27:04.138 --> 27:07.027
Davenport already has a lead
on the source of the story.

27:07.266 --> 27:09.865
No doubt the American
is behind this slander.

27:09.875 --> 27:10.955
He had the most to gain.

27:10.965 --> 27:12.594
Well, speaking of whom,

27:12.594 --> 27:15.614
it appears he will be attending
your shareholders' meeting.

27:15.823 --> 27:17.722
So much for flushing out the beast.

27:17.722 --> 27:20.461
Perhaps you should leave
the vampire hunting to me.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.788
There is ample time for
him to send his regrets.

27:28.178 --> 27:29.247
Huntsman,

27:31.546 --> 27:34.386
much as I have long tolerated your

27:34.386 --> 27:36.725
extracurricular activities,

27:37.395 --> 27:41.702
if you are involved with Grayson
and he proves to be a vampire,

27:42.332 --> 27:45.291
you will not only face the
full wrath of the brotherhood,

27:45.800 --> 27:47.710
but mine as well.

27:50.839 --> 27:51.958
Drive.

28:00.335 --> 28:01.484
Walk on.

28:03.973 --> 28:04.963
I'm winning.

28:04.963 --> 28:06.812
Oh, are you, now?
- Yes.

28:07.402 --> 28:10.021
Shall we wager?
- It is a race, then.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.230
I think we might tie.

28:15.438 --> 28:16.488
Lord Davenport.

28:16.488 --> 28:19.108
Ah, the soon-to-be
Mr. and mrs. Harker.

28:28.113 --> 28:29.752
What on earth are you doing here?

28:29.752 --> 28:31.343
Radiant as ever, miss Murray,

28:31.343 --> 28:33.162
The portrait of the blushing bride.

28:34.181 --> 28:36.481
Uh, Mr. Harker, could I have a word?

28:36.670 --> 28:40.419
Of course. I'll be right back.

28:45.076 --> 28:46.686
You know, I've always found it queer

28:46.686 --> 28:48.625
that Alexander Grayson hides you.

28:49.594 --> 28:52.564
I mean, what need does an
American entrepreneur have

28:52.564 --> 28:54.552
for a rapacious journalist?

28:56.711 --> 28:59.031
Given the recent libel of General Shaw,

28:59.381 --> 29:01.409
I appear to have the answer.

29:03.458 --> 29:06.088
Look, Grayson isn't
involved, and even if he was,

29:06.088 --> 29:08.117
it isn't libel if the charges are true.

29:08.117 --> 29:10.196
I didn't know you had
such a remarkable penchant

29:10.196 --> 29:12.545
for ruining the lives of innocent men.

29:13.195 --> 29:16.554
What makes you so sure that you
are immune from the same fate?

29:27.910 --> 29:30.078
Only one ticket, I'm afraid.

29:31.458 --> 29:32.767
Enjoy the show.

29:49.281 --> 29:51.801
A lady to see you, ma'am, a stranger.

29:51.801 --> 29:53.412
Well, ask her to come in.

29:53.682 --> 29:55.732
The doctor came at the same time, sir.

29:55.732 --> 29:57.570
Did he go straight into my room?

29:57.570 --> 29:59.301
Yes, sir.

30:03.242 --> 30:05.692
How do you do, Nora?
- How do you do?

30:10.762 --> 30:13.212
You don't recognize me, I suppose.

30:13.292 --> 30:15.273
No, I don't know.

30:15.883 --> 30:19.513
Yes. To be sure, I seem to.

30:19.513 --> 30:22.932
Christine, is it really you?
- Yes, it is I.

30:22.932 --> 30:25.922
These are General
Shaw's personal accounts.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.552
It's all there,

30:27.652 --> 30:31.353
sole shareholder, empire munitions.

30:31.353 --> 30:34.523
She's not a bookkeeper.
She's an actress.

30:34.523 --> 30:37.063
I've altered.
- You have altered.

30:37.063 --> 30:38.683
Yes, indeed.

30:38.733 --> 30:41.493
Nine, ten long years.

30:47.884 --> 30:49.463
Well, isn't this handsome?

30:49.463 --> 30:52.433
It's an ivory satin-draped
bodice with a broad yoke

30:52.433 --> 30:55.474
and a gored skirt, trimmed
with the lilies of the valley.

30:56.453 --> 30:58.963
I prefer a train. They're so regal.

30:59.253 --> 31:01.294
A seamstress could make the additions.

31:03.604 --> 31:04.724
Truly, Mina,

31:04.724 --> 31:06.563
one should at least
pretend to derive pleasure

31:06.563 --> 31:08.343
from the planning of one's own wedding,

31:08.343 --> 31:11.004
if only for appearances' sake.
- I do.

31:12.124 --> 31:13.374
It's just...

31:14.845 --> 31:16.944
I think I'm being deceived.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.274
By whom?

31:21.034 --> 31:22.934
Professor Van Helsing.

31:25.314 --> 31:27.244
What would he gain from lying to you?

31:28.285 --> 31:29.575
I don't know.

31:30.314 --> 31:33.535
I suppose I haven't been
a beacon of honesty myself.

31:34.664 --> 31:36.325
This substance that
I've been working with

31:36.325 --> 31:37.944
has some astounding properties,

31:37.944 --> 31:41.035
characteristics that could
revolutionize medicine.

31:41.035 --> 31:44.525
Why would anybody want to conceal
such an incredible discovery?

31:47.846 --> 31:49.506
Perhaps he doesn't want to,

31:49.825 --> 31:51.556
but that he feels that he should.

31:52.355 --> 31:55.046
Speaking of such notions is taboo.

31:55.675 --> 31:56.886
I'm sorry.

31:57.566 --> 32:02.106
All this talk of science
and research and cures,

32:02.825 --> 32:05.236
you must find it all intolerably dull.

32:05.876 --> 32:07.696
Not when you're speaking of it.

32:08.486 --> 32:10.356
You're kind to humor me.

32:12.336 --> 32:15.086
It's not kindness, Mina, but love.

32:31.127 --> 32:32.567
Lucy.

32:34.336 --> 32:35.657
I love you, Mina.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.217
I love you.

32:37.586 --> 32:40.407
We're dear friends. We're sisters, even.

32:40.517 --> 32:42.307
We could be so much more.

32:43.497 --> 32:46.077
It's a natural part of our maturation.

32:55.817 --> 32:58.308
I broke things off with
Alastair, did I tell you?

32:58.867 --> 32:59.777
Mother begged to know the reason.

32:59.777 --> 33:01.348
She would have flogged
it out of me if she could,

33:01.348 --> 33:04.738
but I couldn't tell her
- wouldn't tell her.

33:05.338 --> 33:06.987
The reason I did it was you.

33:08.908 --> 33:10.968
I've always loved you, Mina.
- Lucy.

33:10.968 --> 33:12.088
I didn't realize it till now,

33:12.088 --> 33:14.297
but I now know that I always have.

33:15.229 --> 33:18.598
So every time that we've

33:19.028 --> 33:22.069
danced and dressed and cried

33:22.069 --> 33:23.728
and slept together...

33:24.998 --> 33:27.489
Is that why you wanted my Jonathan?

33:28.048 --> 33:29.959
Not to protect me,
but for your own gain?

33:29.959 --> 33:30.558
No, Mina, it's not like that.

33:30.558 --> 33:33.628
Has our whole friendship
been a pretense?

33:33.809 --> 33:35.558
Of course not.

33:39.339 --> 33:41.669
Um, you need to leave.

33:42.399 --> 33:45.209
But, Mina...
- Please, Lucy.

34:01.759 --> 34:04.330
The electrical current
will start the heart,

34:04.330 --> 34:07.400
and the heart-your heart will beat.

34:07.410 --> 34:09.630
Your natural blood pressure
will not be sufficient

34:09.630 --> 34:13.458
to fully distribute the solar
serum through the small capillaries

34:13.620 --> 34:15.380
and infuse the tissue,

34:15.380 --> 34:17.521
as you might recall
from our last efforts.

34:17.521 --> 34:20.039
I don't think I'll ever
forget our last effort.

34:20.129 --> 34:22.590
This apparatus will
augment your blood pressure

34:22.590 --> 34:24.840
and infuse the tissues.

34:24.940 --> 34:29.550
You will experience some... Discomfort.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.771
The pressure must be immense

34:31.781 --> 34:36.031
to ensure complete
saturation of the tissues.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.831
Are you sure you still
want to do this, sir?

34:41.681 --> 34:43.451
If I don't do this, Renfield,

34:43.451 --> 34:45.620
all our efforts will have been in vain.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.620
We can't win if we don't go all in.

34:54.772 --> 34:56.101
We are ready.

35:00.581 --> 35:02.532
Ready.
- Now.

35:06.332 --> 35:07.621
Power off!

35:12.231 --> 35:13.372
Again.

35:16.443 --> 35:18.662
Again! Now!

35:22.232 --> 35:23.333
Enough.

35:24.132 --> 35:25.273
Quickly.

36:05.272 --> 36:06.988
Grayson's late.

36:08.138 --> 36:10.024
Grayson's finished.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.270
No sign of Mr. Grayson.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.026
How unfortunate for you.

36:37.344 --> 36:40.240
Might I recommend keeping
it short, for once?

36:40.610 --> 36:43.785
We have no idea how
long the serum will last.

36:46.820 --> 36:50.167
I've never been quite so motivated
to be concise in all my life.

37:26.773 --> 37:28.460
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

37:29.199 --> 37:31.255
I intend on being brief,

37:31.275 --> 37:33.962
because nothing quite
ruins a beautiful, sunny day

37:33.962 --> 37:37.497
like talks of profits and earning.

37:46.203 --> 37:50.567
Let us begin by looking at the
financial condition of British Imperial.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.617
All very well talking
this way, Mr. Grayson,

37:57.627 --> 38:00.422
but we've yet to see any profits.

38:00.422 --> 38:03.759
Lord Rothcroft, I
understand your concerns.

38:03.769 --> 38:07.921
All I can say is that
with absolute confidence

38:07.921 --> 38:09.879
that you can expect handsome profits

38:09.879 --> 38:13.704
at the end of this quarter
and many more to come.

38:22.261 --> 38:23.869
Excuse me, gentlemen.

38:31.497 --> 38:35.592
Before I go, allow me to say this.

38:40.515 --> 38:43.171
Nothing speaks louder than success.

38:43.810 --> 38:47.714
British Imperial is
and will continue to be

38:47.824 --> 38:51.130
a key partner in the
development of energy technology

38:51.130 --> 38:54.564
that will drive the next century.

39:05.119 --> 39:09.053
Mr. Grayson, you haven't quite
answered all our questions.

39:10.102 --> 39:11.369
Given that Grayson Energy is

39:11.369 --> 39:13.776
the sole customer of
