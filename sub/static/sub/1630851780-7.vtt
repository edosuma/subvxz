WEBVTT

00:30.263 --> 00:32.632
-Hi, Tai!
-Hi! Shall we grab a beer?

00:33.233 --> 00:36.336
I'd love to, but I can't.
I'm in the middle of something.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.540
I can't just forget
about me father.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.476
I'm sorry. I don't have
the right to judge, but...

00:44.677 --> 00:46.546
I just wanted to go
and have a beer with you.

00:46.613 --> 00:47.580
I know.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.183
Thank you. Really.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.353
Don't you think it'd be better
if Raul helped you?

00:54.454 --> 00:55.422
No, not yet.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.857
Don't tell anyone about this.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.193
I'll talk to Raul eventually.
I promise.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.362
I'm just waiting
for the right moment. Bye.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.276
EPISODE:
ZAYN

02:17.837 --> 02:18.805
Thanks.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.243
Amir.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.579
This cheesy thing is awesome,
a work of art, man.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.148
Aisha has been teaching me.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.319
Here. Sorry for the distraction.

02:33.887 --> 02:34.854
You know how my life is.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.157
What is this, Raul?

02:37.223 --> 02:38.391
My wedding gift.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.594
But you know
I haven't got married yet.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.897
You've been engaged
for three years, right?

02:43.963 --> 02:45.031
I never gave you anything.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.468
The truth is, you've been
an excellent informant.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.336
Yes, a friend. Thank you.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.808
What's wrong?

02:56.609 --> 02:58.778
Did something happen?
You look...

02:58.845 --> 03:01.281
I'm a bit tired, Raul.
Maybe I got the flu.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.052
What's going on?

03:08.087 --> 03:09.656
Do you know my brother Zayn?

03:10.223 --> 03:11.758
He came with Aisha from Syria.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.828
Yes. He sometimes
works here, right?

03:15.895 --> 03:16.863
I think I know him.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.831
Exactly.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.968
He was last seen 15 days ago.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.371
What?

03:25.438 --> 03:28.041
My parents came to Brazil
for my wedding.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.176
They've spent four years
waiting for this,

03:30.243 --> 03:32.946
for me to raise money
to build my house with Aisha.

03:33.012 --> 03:34.514
Now I have it all, Raul,

03:36.349 --> 03:37.483
but my brother is missing,

03:37.550 --> 03:39.185
and I'm not in the mood
to do anything.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.022
Aisha says
that's why I get sick.

03:43.923 --> 03:46.059
Nobody told you anything?

03:46.125 --> 03:47.760
Here at the market
or the taken building?

03:49.028 --> 03:53.333
You know, in my situation,
I can't ask too many questions.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.034
I can't even go to the police.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.069
Right.

03:57.136 --> 03:58.104
Fifteen days?

04:01.274 --> 04:03.576
Who was the last person
to talk to Zayn?

04:03.643 --> 04:05.812
Me. We left the building
together.

04:05.878 --> 04:06.946
I came here to open the stand,

04:07.013 --> 04:08.548
and he went to buy
some things we needed,

04:08.948 --> 04:10.583
some kitchen tools,
to this shop next door,

04:10.650 --> 04:11.618
but never came back.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.155
Listen,
I'll work this out, okay?

04:16.222 --> 04:18.091
You know I can't pay you
right now.

04:18.157 --> 04:19.225
Please, forget about it.

04:19.292 --> 04:20.526
You don't need to pay me.

04:20.593 --> 04:24.163
Just focus on getting better,
getting over the flu.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.469
Let's do some betting. Ten.

04:29.535 --> 04:32.405
I can't believe you're betting
on Maria Júlia's whereabouts.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.974
I wouldn't be surprised
if she disappeared from here

04:35.041 --> 04:36.976
in the same way
she showed up at "Ausentes".

04:37.043 --> 04:38.177
-Out of nowhere.
-Of course not.

04:38.244 --> 04:41.781
She must be with a guy,
they must have slept together.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.616
If you really believe that,
put ten bucks.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.485
What are you betting on, Waldir?

04:45.551 --> 04:46.519
Betting?

04:50.023 --> 04:53.326
Listen. Zayn Farah.
21 years old.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.460
Syrian.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.396
He's been living
in São Paulo for four years.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.732
He works at a food stand
with his brother, Amir.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.036
He doesn't have a Brazilian ID
or hold a passport.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.637
He's been missing for 15 days.

05:04.704 --> 05:05.772
Does he have a phone?

05:05.838 --> 05:07.507
Yes, according to his brother,

05:07.573 --> 05:09.008
but he's not answering
his calls.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.610
-It's a cloned line.
-Where does he live?

05:11.044 --> 05:12.945
At a taken building
near Cambucí.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.482
He has his own food stand
at Mooca.

05:16.549 --> 05:17.650
And...

05:17.717 --> 05:20.119
They work together.
They are like two peas in a pod.

05:20.186 --> 05:21.788
But his brother is missing.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.590
Can I ask you something?
How is he going to pay for this?

05:24.657 --> 05:25.658
It's going to be pro bono.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.262
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong, you ask?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.231
He's a good man
and a good informant.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.201
Waldir,
go to the taken building.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.670
-Cambucí?
-Right.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.939
Tai, look more into Zayn's life.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.774
Edith, don't you have
clients to attend to

05:41.841 --> 05:42.909
or candies to make?

05:42.975 --> 05:45.611
-Hey!
-Where is Maria Júlia?

05:46.846 --> 05:47.814
What the hell!

06:02.695 --> 06:03.863
It smells good.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.867
Two brothers at that stand.
Amir and Zayn.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.103
-No.
-Have you seen him?

06:10.737 --> 06:12.405
I sell fabrics.
I haven't seen him.

06:16.642 --> 06:17.610
Hi.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.912
-How are you?
-Fine, and you?

06:19.979 --> 06:20.980
Good.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.183
Do you know Zayn,
Amir's brother?

06:24.851 --> 06:27.820
Yes, of course.
He always shops here.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.189
When was the last time
Zayn was here?

06:30.723 --> 06:32.592
Two weeks, at least.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.528
When he was here, was he weird?

06:35.595 --> 06:39.332
Do you think
he was talking or acting weird?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.666
No, he just wanted to know

06:40.733 --> 06:44.303
how to earn extra money.

06:44.370 --> 06:46.406
He was on the phone
with someone.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.675
He was arguing.
He left before buying anything.

07:12.698 --> 07:13.666
There.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.502
You can come in.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.882
Excuse me.
I work with Raul Fagnani.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.118
Amir hired us.

07:32.185 --> 07:36.456
I know it must be painful
to talk about your son Zayn,

07:36.522 --> 07:39.459
but any information
can be helpful

07:40.626 --> 07:42.195
Please, come in and sit down.

07:42.762 --> 07:43.729
Excuse me.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.368
My mother had a sewing machine
just like that one.

07:49.435 --> 07:50.870
Is it yours?

07:52.672 --> 07:53.973
She understands Portuguese.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.708
She doesn't speak,
but she understand.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.611
When it's not working,
Zayn fixes it, you know?

07:59.212 --> 08:00.980
-Where does Zayn sleep?
-There.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.351
-May I...?
-Yes, sure.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.385
Excuse me.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.132
Do those fabrics belong to Zayn?

08:54.567 --> 08:56.335
His mother likes sewing.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.071
Zayn got a good discount
from some friends

08:59.138 --> 09:00.706
and brought them here.

09:00.773 --> 09:01.807
Does he have many friends?

09:02.241 --> 09:04.911
Amir is his best friend.
They're always together.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.312
Does he have a girlfriend?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.281
Our community doesn't have
lots of women.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.376
Maria Júlia?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.050
How did you find me?

09:45.885 --> 09:47.653
I work
in an investigation agency.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.023
We sometimes find things out.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.027
I didn't know
if you liked flowers.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.465
I brought these for you.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.016
Mom?

10:21.454 --> 10:22.421
Sit down, please.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.834
Dad told me he gifted
this greenhouse to you.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.438
It's beautiful.

10:40.406 --> 10:41.841
Everything's going
to be okay, mom.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.277
You know?

10:46.379 --> 10:47.446
It's going to be okay.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.751
I'm going to take care of you.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.441
I promise he won't hurt you.

11:16.108 --> 11:18.444
I gave him money
so that we could talk.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.013
Just a few questions.

11:23.382 --> 11:24.450
I know him.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.519
It's sad. Amir is a good guy.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.521
He wants Zayn back.

11:28.587 --> 11:31.924
Aisha, I know you find it hard
to talk about anything.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.427
But I need you to trust me
when I say

11:35.361 --> 11:36.328
I'm here to help.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.432
Did Amir and Zayn have a fight?

11:46.105 --> 11:48.407
CANDY PALACE

11:57.316 --> 11:58.884
Easy, man.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.821
I don't want to carry
anyone today.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.090
I haven't seen you for so long.

12:04.523 --> 12:05.558
Since...

12:06.459 --> 12:08.327
Since you activated the grenade

12:08.394 --> 12:10.930
and made me look like a fool
in my own police station.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.781
Here's to the fool.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.022
What about the new girl?

12:37.790 --> 12:38.991
Did she get rid of you already?

12:40.226 --> 12:43.162
If you're here
waiting for an apology,

12:43.229 --> 12:44.530
you came on the wrong day.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.265
Me?

12:49.335 --> 12:52.037
Demanding an apology
from the great Raul Fagnani?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.507
I'm forever grateful, partner.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.812
The man you beat up
in my police station.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.516
For the adoption gang.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.951
You couldn't talk to him
while he was in custody.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.354
But he's no longer in custody.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.089
He is at that address.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.258
Why are you giving this to me?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.448
Raul? I'm worried
about Maria Júlia.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.517
You never liked her, Edith.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.887
I know. But anyway...

13:43.122 --> 13:45.124
The girl is a bit strange.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.961
Maybe she had a meltdown
and disappeared? Yes.

13:50.029 --> 13:50.996
But I don't know.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.766
She was happy here, wasn't she?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.668
She seemed happy.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.271
Did something happen to her?

14:00.673 --> 14:01.640
I don't know that.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.510
But I do know
I'll get a headache

14:04.577 --> 14:07.112
if I keep talking about this.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.617
My Lord!

14:15.487 --> 14:17.323
-Raul.
-Thanks, Waldir.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.330
Okay, let's go.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.499
When Zayn was last seen,

14:27.566 --> 14:29.134
he was arguing with someone
over the phone.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.505
Aisha, Amir's girlfriend,
says Zayn and Amir had a fight.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.876
Was it Amir who was arguing
with Zayn over the phone?

14:36.942 --> 14:38.177
Don't they work together?

14:38.244 --> 14:39.778
Yes, at the food stand.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.814
He was trying to get
another job.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.515
He had had an argument
with his brother

14:43.582 --> 14:44.984
because he wanted
to become independent.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.318
What job was that?

14:47.119 --> 14:50.756
Maybe we get more information
about Zayn from those people.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.626
I found some rolls of fabric
under his mattress.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.229
That's something very expensive
for someone who sells food.

14:57.296 --> 14:58.697
What are you getting at?

14:58.764 --> 15:01.367
Zayn's father told me
he fixes sewing machines.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.636
He may be working
in a factory, in a store.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.673
Many immigrants are used
as slaves in those places.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.376
There must be
around 200 factories in Brás.

15:10.709 --> 15:13.279
Immigrants don't go too far
from their community.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.748
It's too dangerous to do that.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.850
If Zayn got a job,

15:17.917 --> 15:20.753
someone from the taken building
must have let him know about it.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.354
That's right.

15:23.389 --> 15:24.356
Tai, go with Waldir.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.560
Okay, but I've never done
field research before.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.030
There's a first time
for everything, right?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.167
I'm leaving. Don't be late.

15:35.701 --> 15:36.669
Tai?

15:37.670 --> 15:42.541
I've noticed Maria Júlia and you
are hiding something.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.377
Does that have to do
with her disappearing?

15:49.248 --> 15:52.318
Would you prefer me
to find out on my own?

15:52.384 --> 15:53.352
Would you?

15:54.386 --> 15:56.956
Or we can sort this out
once and for all

15:57.022 --> 15:58.924
if you start telling me
the truth.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.607
How do you feel?

16:16.775 --> 16:17.743
It was close.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.280
If the car had gone
five miles per hour faster

16:21.347 --> 16:23.949
or had hit me 40 inches higher.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.251
I told you they were dangerous.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.720
You need to be very careful.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.855
I know how to look after myself.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.198
Melina, why don't you stop this?

16:39.264 --> 16:40.366
Go back home.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.067
Carry on with your life.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.068
What home?

16:44.269 --> 16:45.604
I don't have anywhere
to go back to.

16:48.374 --> 16:49.541
I'll go all the way.

16:49.608 --> 16:51.076
You were almost killed
yesterday.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.278
That wouldn't have been nice.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.714
You're a nun, but you worry
too much about death.

16:55.781 --> 16:56.749
Don't you think?

16:57.549 --> 16:59.785
I'm not afraid of death.

17:00.953 --> 17:01.887
I'm afraid of life.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.591
Because it finds so many ways
to humiliate us

17:05.657 --> 17:07.960
that you don't even imagine.

17:09.395 --> 17:10.362
I never understood

17:10.729 --> 17:12.264
why they keep flowers
at the hospital.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.535
Why would you give something
that will die or is already dead

17:16.602 --> 17:17.770
to somebody that's sick?

17:19.805 --> 17:21.173
Are you that bad?

17:21.240 --> 17:23.342
The nurse said
you had some broken bones,

17:23.409 --> 17:25.811
but I see you're being given
the last rites.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.096
Hi.

17:44.863 --> 17:45.831
Hi.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.402
These are for you.

18:00.946 --> 18:01.947
Are you doing to fire me?

18:02.614 --> 18:03.582
It depends.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.419
Are you going to claim
it was a work accident?

18:08.687 --> 18:09.655
No.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.624
It didn't happen
during my working hours.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.463
Actually, I never know
my working hours.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.499
I know the agency

18:21.967 --> 18:24.236
is a little dysfunctional.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.106
But we are a team.

18:28.507 --> 18:31.443
I would jump in front of a train
for any of you.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.812
And I know
you would do the same for me.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.917
You should have talked to me.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.553
You should have told me.

18:46.525 --> 18:47.593
Keep the flowers.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.996
I'll be waiting for you
to come back to the agency.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.132
I hope it's soon.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.636
I won't go easy on you

18:57.703 --> 19:01.206
just because of two or three
broken ribs.

19:02.741 --> 19:03.942
I won't.

19:07.513 --> 19:08.480
Get better soon.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.884
-I will.
-I know.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.187
I know you will.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.708
Find out the details
about that store, Tai.

20:10.576 --> 20:11.944
Okay? Thank you.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.054
Are you Aisha?

20:24.556 --> 20:26.058
We work with Raul.

20:26.458 --> 20:30.062
We need to talk to you and Amir.

20:30.963 --> 20:31.930
.Amir.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.366
Aisha has nothing to say.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.501
Go inside, Aisha

20:45.210 --> 20:47.279
We learnt Zayn and you
got into a fight.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.748
Yes, siblings have fights.
What's wrong with that?

20:49.815 --> 20:52.017
Amir, you hired us.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.418
You need to be honest.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.188
Dad.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.491
Dad, I don't...

21:01.493 --> 21:02.894
Please, this is not
what you think.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.430
What if it's true?

21:05.497 --> 21:06.865
Dad!

21:08.367 --> 21:10.102
No, dad.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.986
If you let me take a puff,
I promise I won't tell anyone.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.800
How do you get rid of the smell
in your hand?

21:42.534 --> 21:43.502
Garlic!

21:44.936 --> 21:47.572
Garlic covers the smell.
I cook at home.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.607
Amir likes it.

21:51.410 --> 21:54.012
Don't you feel uncomfortable
by the way he treats you?

21:54.946 --> 21:56.415
The way he talked to you.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.283
Amir is good.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.520
He's better than the men
where I grew up.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.256
My father and Mr. Farah
are partners.

22:04.756 --> 22:06.024
They arranged the marriage.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.060
Where's your family?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.130
They are dead.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.999
Or in prison.

22:14.633 --> 22:15.667
Or abroad.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.739
Have you ever heard of a factory

22:20.806 --> 22:23.475
who employs
newly arrived immigrants,

22:23.542 --> 22:24.509
undocumented?

22:27.579 --> 22:28.547
Aisha, I...

22:28.980 --> 22:31.116
I know how you feel.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.619
We will find Zayn,
but only if you talk to me.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.255
Think of his mother.

22:37.956 --> 22:39.391
You know how hard it is

22:39.458 --> 22:41.426
to lose someone we love.

22:41.493 --> 22:42.928
How can you know?

22:43.729 --> 22:45.664
Who do you think you are
to tell me that?

22:51.002 --> 22:53.205
What about Aisha?
Did she tell you anything?

22:54.106 --> 22:55.841
Not really, but...

22:56.975 --> 23:00.779
I don't know.
I feel she knows something,

23:00.846 --> 23:01.913
but didn't want to tell me.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.584
Hi.

23:07.519 --> 23:08.620
Hi.

23:08.687 --> 23:10.722
-What's up?
-You live here, right?

23:11.790 --> 23:12.758
Do you want 20 bucks?

23:13.859 --> 23:14.960
Twenty?

23:16.361 --> 23:18.130
What do I have to do
to get them?

23:18.196 --> 23:19.431
Just tell me the name of the guy

23:19.498 --> 23:21.199
that employs people
at the factory.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.336
I prefer not to get
the 20 bucks then.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.371
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

23:26.438 --> 23:28.140
If I pat you down,
will I find weed?

23:28.206 --> 23:30.075
-You're not a cop.
-Would you like to see?

23:30.142 --> 23:31.710
I'm sure your family
are living in Brazil

23:31.777 --> 23:32.844
undocumented.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.813
Do you know
what will happen to them

23:34.880 --> 23:36.014
if I lock you up?

23:38.183 --> 23:39.151
This factory.

23:39.718 --> 23:40.685
Do you know it?

23:42.454 --> 23:44.356
-Baruk.
-Louder. I didn't get it.

23:44.923 --> 23:45.891
Baruk.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.627
This guy, Baruk,
owns the factory.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.196
You can keep them.

23:52.197 --> 23:53.165
Leave.

23:56.468 --> 23:57.702
Was that really necessary?

23:57.769 --> 23:59.037
You were very tough on that kid.

23:59.738 --> 24:00.772
Welcome to my world.

24:07.479 --> 24:10.482
FIND BARUK. HE'S RESPONSIBLE.

24:23.862 --> 24:24.930
Hello.

24:24.996 --> 24:27.065
Are you looking
for something for you?

24:27.732 --> 24:28.800
Yes.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.069
Something for the cold.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.238
They say the winter
is going to be tough.

24:33.305 --> 24:37.142
Yes. In this factory,
we use pure cotton, fabrics.

24:37.209 --> 24:40.712
We don't use wool.
But we have quality fabrics.

24:41.446 --> 24:43.815
You must employ many people

24:43.882 --> 24:46.785
to get to cut
such a big amount of fabric.

24:49.721 --> 24:52.824
I've been told
that you are always

24:52.891 --> 24:54.659
hiring people,

24:54.726 --> 24:56.361
that I should talk to Baruk.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.131
Listen, here we work honestly.

25:00.198 --> 25:02.200
If that's what the police want,
doors are open.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.402
But with a warrant.
Only with a warrant.

25:04.469 --> 25:07.839
Hey, I'm just curious.
I'm not a police officer.

25:08.406 --> 25:10.842
The truth is that Baruk

25:10.909 --> 25:11.910
is a good friend of mine.

25:12.644 --> 25:15.881
And I need to find him,
you know?

25:18.383 --> 25:20.819
We can talk
when I finish my shift.

25:26.124 --> 25:27.092
See you later.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.301
It's horrible.

25:37.402 --> 25:39.604
But have you seen
any convenience store over here?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.848
There's something
I should tell you.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.716
I should have told you already.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.721
-My name is not Maria Júlia.
-I know.

25:56.788 --> 25:57.822
Melina Ruiz.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.893
I did my homework
when you had the accident.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.262
I don't know I lied to you
for so long.

26:06.097 --> 26:08.366
At the end of the day,
you're everything I have.

26:11.469 --> 26:14.105
You and her.

26:15.774 --> 26:16.942
The Mother Superior?

26:19.311 --> 26:21.880
We all have secrets.

26:26.551 --> 26:29.120
What do I call you now? Melina?

26:29.854 --> 26:30.822
Maria Júlia?

26:33.725 --> 26:36.094
I think Maria Júlia suits better
with who I am now.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.239
Did you say
you investigated my father?

26:48.306 --> 26:49.274
Yes.

26:50.375 --> 26:51.977
Not a trace of him.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.746
He hasn't made contact
for so long.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.083
You can't change reality.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.652
You're saying he's dead
and I should move on?

27:02.787 --> 27:05.590
Tai told me about the people
he was related to.

27:05.657 --> 27:06.625
Do you know who they are?

27:07.759 --> 27:08.727
You could have died.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.830
This has gone too far.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.433
If you were me, Raul,

27:18.003 --> 27:19.137
would you stop searching?

27:21.706 --> 27:22.674
That's what I imagined.

27:24.609 --> 27:25.710
I need to keep on doing this.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.249
Tell me who they are.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.452
The company
Tai and you found out

27:35.353 --> 27:36.588
is a front operation.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.659
It's used to import cars,
but, in reality,

27:41.493 --> 27:43.395
it's a cover-up
for drugs and weapons.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.332
That's what I've found out
so far.

27:49.267 --> 27:50.201
Thank you.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.427
Omar Baruk.

28:15.493 --> 28:16.494
It's me.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.030
How did you get to me?

28:25.003 --> 28:27.839
Regular fabric shops
don't receive

28:27.906 --> 28:29.507
big amounts of fabric, do they?

28:30.275 --> 28:32.977
It looks like you have
just one seller at the shop.

28:33.611 --> 28:36.214
But I saw a man
brought snacks earlier.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.883
How many people do you keep
in your basement?

28:38.950 --> 28:40.351
Is that how you will talk to me?

28:40.752 --> 28:42.253
If you're looking
for that kind of conversation,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.622
-you can leave now.
-No. Please, no.

28:44.689 --> 28:47.025
I didn't come here
to find out about the slaves.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.127
Just one in particular.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.296
His name is Zayn Farah.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.700
Slave?

28:56.468 --> 28:57.435
Zayn?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.571
Zayn is not a slave.

28:59.637 --> 29:01.372
Zayn is the manager of the shop.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.179
Zayn is a smart guy.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.449
I wouldn't make him
fix machines.

29:12.050 --> 29:14.085
It would be a waste of talent.

29:14.552 --> 29:18.323
His responsibility
is making the staff progress.

29:19.057 --> 29:21.493
-When did he start?
-About a month ago.

29:21.559 --> 29:24.996
But it's not easy.
He has a strong personality.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.931
Do you know
where he is, where he lives?

29:28.900 --> 29:32.971
I suspect that just telling you
where my best man is

29:33.037 --> 29:35.140
is the worst idea.

29:41.646 --> 29:43.848
I care about people.

29:43.915 --> 29:44.883
That's good.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.686
He's at my friend's apartment.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.756
But it's dangerous there.

29:52.223 --> 29:53.558
It's in Crackland.

29:54.359 --> 29:57.662
I wouldn't go there at night.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.519
Why did you call me?
Is Zayn here?

30:21.586 --> 30:24.455
We can't do anything for Zayn
until tomorrow morning.

30:24.856 --> 30:25.857
This is something private.

30:26.758 --> 30:27.725
Private?

30:30.061 --> 30:31.796
Damasceno has arrested a man

30:33.264 --> 30:35.500
from the gang
that kidnapped Sofia.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.871
That bastard kidnapped
four and five-year-old kids.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.005
He assaulted them.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.843
He's the man
that kidnapped Sofia, Waldir.

30:45.577 --> 30:46.544
I see.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.479
Still. Don't even try.

31:24.816 --> 31:25.783
Let him go, Waldir.

31:26.684 --> 31:28.586
Let him go now!

31:28.653 --> 31:30.588
I want him! Don't move!

31:38.263 --> 31:40.565
When I was a kid,
a guy in my neighborhood

31:41.499 --> 31:43.401
loved talking to children.

31:43.801 --> 31:44.869
Please, man!

31:45.236 --> 31:47.572
The people from the neighborhood
beat him up.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.107
He got so badly injured

31:49.173 --> 31:51.075
that he couldn't tell his story.

31:58.783 --> 32:01.819
I still don't know
what he wanted from those kids.

32:02.287 --> 32:03.655
I don't know his story.

32:04.522 --> 32:05.623
Sometimes,

32:06.157 --> 32:08.426
the only thing we need
is a chance

32:08.493 --> 32:11.362
to tell our story.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.064
A chance to redeem ourselves.

32:13.131 --> 32:16.267
A chance to fix our mistakes.

32:23.508 --> 32:24.475
Raul.

32:35.987 --> 32:37.655
Wait, the guy
drove through a red light,

32:37.722 --> 32:38.890
and nobody called the police?

32:39.557 --> 32:40.825
No, I don't think so.

32:40.892 --> 32:44.295
The street was empty.
Nobody saw it.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.531
The car that ran over you,
is it the same car

32:46.597 --> 32:48.866
you saw in the car rental shop
and your father's apartment?

32:49.600 --> 32:52.704
Is there anyone in São Paulo
you haven't told you about this?

32:52.770 --> 32:55.473
Look at the size
of the agency, Maria.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.075
Everyone knows everything here.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.609
Besides, what's the matter
with that?

32:59.577 --> 33:02.013
Do you know what it is?
Raul's curse.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.782
Yes, that man attracts
tragedies.

33:04.849 --> 33:05.984
He does.

33:06.050 --> 33:08.286
All the women
he becomes involved with

33:08.353 --> 33:09.320
end up like that.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.222
No, but I'm not...

33:11.789 --> 33:14.659
What's going on? My Lord!
I can't say anything.

33:23.267 --> 33:24.202
Raul?

33:24.602 --> 33:26.004
About last night...

33:26.070 --> 33:29.240
We're going to look
into the address he gave me

33:30.875 --> 33:32.477
once we're done with this case.

33:35.613 --> 33:38.916
I'm really worried about Amir.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.419
I'm worried that he succumbs.

33:43.654 --> 33:46.157
Listen, we thought Zayn
had fallen into the hands

33:46.224 --> 33:48.026
of those who take advantage
of immigrants.

33:48.826 --> 33:49.794
That wasn't the case.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.631
He put himself forward
as a manager of slaves.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.166
He's fine!

33:55.600 --> 33:56.701
And by "fine", he means

33:56.768 --> 33:58.436
he's living in an apartment
in Crackland.

33:59.303 --> 34:02.373
Zayn fought with his brother,
and got a far off job and place.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.875
Why didn't he tell anyone
about it?

34:03.941 --> 34:06.778
-Why did they fight?
-Ask his brother.

34:06.844 --> 34:09.347
If you asked him already,
do it again.

34:10.281 --> 34:12.216
If he wants to find his brother,
he will need to talk.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.186
We won't find anything out
if we stay here.

34:15.586 --> 34:17.088
Talking to his parents
doesn't work.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.923
They think Zayn is a saint.

34:20.258 --> 34:21.893
And his girlfriend
won't say a word either.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.829
-His girlfriend!
-What about her?

34:24.896 --> 34:25.863
Of course!

34:26.297 --> 34:27.398
It has to be that, Raul.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.134
Tai!

34:30.535 --> 34:32.637
The girlfriend idea
was mine! Tai!

34:37.975 --> 34:39.043
No. You need to rest.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.180
-Raul, please.
-I'm serious.

34:42.713 --> 34:43.681
Edith?

34:44.048 --> 34:45.516
Keep an eye on her, okay?

34:45.950 --> 34:48.586
She mustn't go out.
If she does, you're both fired.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.055
I don't even work for you!

34:52.356 --> 34:53.558
It's delicious.

34:54.959 --> 34:56.094
Amazing.

34:57.895 --> 34:59.063
This snack

34:59.497 --> 35:01.866
should be considered
historic heritage.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.069
-It's fantastic.
-We're not in a cooking show.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.104
Aisha is not here.

35:06.904 --> 35:09.240
That's weird.
She rarely doesn't come.

35:09.307 --> 35:10.641
She told me her boss
is annoying.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.376
Okay. It seems
that, once a week,

35:12.443 --> 35:16.247
she visits her sister,
who is sick. Or seems to be.

35:16.314 --> 35:17.548
I don't know,
I didn't understand.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.817
Her sister? She lost her family
during the war.

35:20.351 --> 35:21.719
Why would he lie to her boss?

35:21.786 --> 35:24.789
It depends on who she visits
when she finishes working.

35:25.723 --> 35:27.191
If it's a man...

35:32.864 --> 35:34.465
Can I know
what we're looking for?

35:36.667 --> 35:40.471
Something that proves
that Aisha is the reason

35:40.538 --> 35:42.106
why these two brothers
had a fight.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.910
You said that, as days go by,
Amir's health gets worse.

35:46.544 --> 35:48.312
Yes, but it doesn't surprise me.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.048
His brother's been missing
for so long.

35:51.415 --> 35:52.617
They were like two peas
in a pod.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.919
But I saw how he treated Aisha.

35:55.353 --> 35:58.055
Honestly, if I had been her,
I wouldn't have liked it.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.893
They have
a different culture, Tai.

36:02.860 --> 36:03.828
I know.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.758
There's no point. There isn't!

36:34.325 --> 36:38.062
Let's see if we can find
Zayn and Aisha in Crackland.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.205
This is the apocalypse, right?

36:57.982 --> 36:58.950
Aisha.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.074
Zayn. Hold on.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.443
I want to talk to you.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.213
Your brother hired me
to look for you.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.715
They are really worried.

37:30.781 --> 37:33.184
-You don't get it.
-Yes. I know you argued, but...

37:33.651 --> 37:35.720
Your parents said
that you and your brother

37:35.786 --> 37:38.322
have been best friends
since forever.

37:38.389 --> 37:41.292
Maybe I'm your only chance
to clear up everything.

37:41.359 --> 37:42.326
Hey, I saw you.

37:43.461 --> 37:45.896
Is Aisha the reason?
Do you want your brother's wife?

37:47.565 --> 37:48.799
Don't say her name.

37:50.534 --> 37:52.637
For Amir, Aisha is an object.

37:53.237 --> 37:54.905
A way to get other things.

37:57.141 --> 37:59.443
Not for me.
She's my entire life.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.512
We need to run away
to have a live in peace.

38:02.179 --> 38:03.147
I see.

38:05.082 --> 38:07.351
Why don't you explain this
to them

38:07.418 --> 38:09.253
and try to talk?

38:10.888 --> 38:13.224
I ask you. I beg you.

38:14.091 --> 38:17.295
I beg you.
Don't tell Amir where I am.

38:17.862 --> 38:18.829
Not now.

38:19.964 --> 38:20.931
We're really close.

38:21.432 --> 38:22.633
Amir is very sick.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.836
He's been very weak
since you disappeared.

38:25.903 --> 38:30.474
Zayn, Amir is my client,
but he's also my friend.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.610
I wouldn't be fair for me
not to tell him about this.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.522
You can't be that nervous.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.290
You are restless.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.792
Leave her alone, Edith.

38:47.858 --> 38:49.427
She's been standing for hours.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.662
Did you expect me to jump
over Crackland's wall

38:51.729 --> 38:53.297
-with Waldir?
-I didn't expect anything.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.466
What? When did we start
jumping over walls?

38:56.634 --> 38:58.169
Have you even seen
my knee, Edith?

38:58.235 --> 38:59.837
It can tell you
the humidity level.

39:02.406 --> 39:03.841
Come here, Waldir.

39:31.802 --> 39:34.038
I sacrificed myself so much.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.742
I worked nonstop, day and night.

39:39.810 --> 39:40.778
What for?

39:47.952 --> 39:49.253
You're a good friend, Raul.

39:52.423 --> 39:53.391
Thank you.

39:54.892 --> 39:55.860
You're young, Amir.

39:56.827 --> 39:57.862
You're full of life.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.898
Look after your health, live!

40:01.465 --> 40:03.067
Many good things
will happen to you.

40:21.852 --> 40:23.687
Do you want to finish
what we started yesterday?

40:39.703 --> 40:41.005
Is this the right address?

40:43.073 --> 40:44.675
He wouldn't lie.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.311
This place
used to be their base.

40:47.378 --> 40:48.846
There has to be something
in here.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.029
I don't know why you didn't tell
Raul about the jar.

41:39.530 --> 41:40.998
Aisha is only 20 years old.

41:41.065 --> 41:42.800
She lost her family in Syria.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.168
She's alone,
and he controls her.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.103
I think she deserves a chance.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.574
Aisha!

41:50.641 --> 41:52.076
We're here to talk to you.

41:52.910 --> 41:55.679
I found this in your house.
Tell me what it is.

41:55.746 --> 41:56.847
You don't get it.

41:56.914 --> 41:59.149
Aisha, you're in Brazil.
Things are different here.

41:59.216 --> 42:01.752
You don't need to get married.

42:04.788 --> 42:05.756
Aisha.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.859
You don't need this
in order to be free here.

42:10.394 --> 42:11.362
Is that what you think?

42:11.896 --> 42:13.163
It's arsenic, right?

42:13.831 --> 42:15.332
You were going to kill Amir
with this?

42:15.633 --> 42:17.201
Amir is good with others.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.203
But not with me at home.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.205
Zayn really loves me.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.207
I lost everything in the war.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.076
Zayn is the only good thing
I have left.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.947
I don't want to kill anyone.
I just want to live my life.

42:30.014 --> 42:31.081
I know.

42:31.148 --> 42:32.650
-I just want to live with Zayn.
-I know.

42:32.716 --> 42:35.519
But we need to take Amir
to the hospital, you know?

42:35.586 --> 42:37.187
-To the hospital?
-We need to.

42:37.254 --> 42:38.556
You're not going anywhere!

42:38.622 --> 42:40.357
-Amir!
-Bastard!

42:40.424 --> 42:41.859
-Amir!
-You're a slut!

42:42.560 --> 42:43.527
Let's go, Aisha.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.496
Please, calm down!

42:45.563 --> 42:47.097
Come on, Aisha!

43:17.661 --> 43:19.663
-Tell me, Tai.
-You have to come, Raul.

43:19.730 --> 43:20.998
Amir is going to kill
his brother.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.667
Damn it! Okay.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.441
Zayn, come out now!

43:30.507 --> 43:32.710
Come on, be a man
and show your face!

43:33.177 --> 43:35.546
Zayn, come out now!

43:35.613 --> 43:37.214
Be a man!

43:37.815 --> 43:39.583
Zayn, come out!

43:40.751 --> 43:42.386
Be a man and show your face!

43:43.654 --> 43:44.622
Amir!

43:45.089 --> 43:46.056
Put your gun down.

43:47.024 --> 43:48.926
-Calm.
-She should stop crying

43:48.993 --> 43:50.561
and tell everyone the truth.

43:51.061 --> 43:53.163
Aisha is a slut! A slut!

43:53.230 --> 43:56.166
She confessed they've been
together since Syria.

43:56.700 --> 43:58.902
Her parents would be ashamed
of what she has done.

44:01.605 --> 44:03.073
Put your gun down, man!

44:03.140 --> 44:06.143
So many women in the world.
Why mine?

44:06.443 --> 44:07.845
-Why, Raul?
-Yes.

44:08.612 --> 44:10.014
Why mine?

44:13.283 --> 44:14.551
Aisha is the love of my life!

44:15.786 --> 44:17.054
I love her!

44:19.223 --> 44:20.324
And I'm going to die for her!

44:22.292 --> 44:23.927
No! No!

44:25.295 --> 44:26.397
Stop!

44:26.463 --> 44:27.431
Calm!

44:37.975 --> 44:38.942
Zayn!

45:17.648 --> 45:18.716
What are we doing here?

45:21.852 --> 45:24.388
Do you see any allotment
or vegetable garden here?

45:26.523 --> 45:28.325
If there's no garden
to look after,

45:28.926 --> 45:30.594
what are all these shovels for?

45:31.028 --> 45:31.995
Start digging, Waldir.

45:32.529 --> 45:34.531
We need to dig holes
all over the garden.

45:37.401 --> 45:38.335
Come on!

46:01.125 --> 46:02.092
Waldir.

46:04.728 --> 46:05.696
Waldir.

46:10.701 --> 46:11.668
What is that?

46:13.737 --> 46:15.272
It's a damn human bone!

46:18.876 --> 46:19.843
It belonged...

46:21.178 --> 46:21.979
to a kid.

46:22.045 --> 46:22.146
to a kid.
