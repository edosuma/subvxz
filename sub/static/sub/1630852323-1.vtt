<i>Do you feel like it affects</i>

13:42.738 --> 13:45.199
<i>I don't know. I like being long-distance</i>

<i>They live kind of in</i>
<i>a remote area on a lot of land,</i>

27:06.124 --> 27:08.877
<i>and so it took the firefighters</i>
<i>a while to get there,</i>

27:08.960 --> 27:10.879
<i>so just nothing is saved. Nothing.</i>

27:11.463 --> 27:12.756
<i>-Burnt to the ground.</i>
<i>-Bad.</i>

27:12.839 --> 27:15.467
<i>-[woman] That is so sad.</i>
<i>-I just can't imagine.</i>

27:15.550 --> 27:18.887
<i>-[Rena] Is her mom okay?</i>
<i>-She's dealing with it. She's not okay.</i>

27:18.970 --> 27:22.265
<i>Sharelle is not doing well</i>
<i>because obviously they're super close.</i>

27:22.349 --> 27:24.809
<i>So does anything change</i>
<i>about the event tomorrow?</i>

27:24.893 --> 27:26.436
<i>No. Nothing is going to change.</i>

27:26.519 --> 27:29.105
<i>We have guests coming.</i>
<i>We can't let the seller down.</i>

27:29.189 --> 27:30.940
<i>We're not sure if Sharelle's gonna attend,</i>

27:31.024 --> 27:34.277
<i>so we really need to make sure</i>
<i>we step it up and still be there.</i>

27:34.361 --> 27:35.820
<i>Everyone has their invites out.</i>

27:35.904 --> 27:37.405
<i>-We do.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

27:37.489 --> 27:40.200
<i>The start time is 6:00 p.m.,</i>
<i>so it is an evening event.</i>

27:40.283 --> 27:44.913
<i>Speaking of evening event,</i>
<i>I have some notes.</i>

27:44.996 --> 27:47.123
<i>-For the attire?</i>
<i>-Team alert.</i>

27:47.207 --> 27:48.458
<i>Get ready for the notes.</i>

27:48.541 --> 27:51.294
<i>-So it's cocktail-hour attire.</i>
<i>-Her notes.</i>

27:51.378 --> 27:54.214
<i>That's going to be important</i>
<i>because we need to look the part</i>

27:54.297 --> 27:55.465
<i>and we're doing that.</i>

27:55.548 --> 27:57.801
<i>So, I took the liberty</i>

27:57.884 --> 28:01.763
<i>of looking up and sharing with you</i>
<i>what "cocktail" means.</i>

28:02.639 --> 28:04.557
<i>-[Rena] This is for Colony.</i>
<i>-Girl…</i>

28:04.641 --> 28:07.227
<i>-[Rena] Take notes, girl.</i>
<i>-I know the assignment, okay?</i>

28:07.310 --> 28:08.395
<i>You feeling the energy?</i>

28:08.478 --> 28:10.105
<i>Let's hear Juawana's list.</i>

28:10.188 --> 28:12.774
<i>-Let us hear it. Please.</i>
<i>-[Juawana] Okay.</i>

28:12.857 --> 28:15.819
<i>Because everyone's perception</i>
<i>is a little bit different.</i>

28:15.902 --> 28:17.153
<i>-Go ahead.</i>
<i>-[Juawana] So…</i>

28:17.237 --> 28:21.157
<i>"Cocktail attire is suitable</i>
<i>at a semi-formal occasion,</i>

28:21.241 --> 28:23.243
<i>sometimes called cocktail parties."</i>

28:23.326 --> 28:24.786
<i>-Wow.</i>
<i>-[Rena] No surprise there.</i>

28:24.869 --> 28:27.288
<i>[Juawana] "Usually in</i>
<i>the late afternoon or evening,"</i>

28:27.372 --> 28:31.126
<i>hence the 6:00 p.m.,</i>
<i>"And usually with accessories."</i>

28:31.209 --> 28:34.421
<i>-"After World War I, the idea--"</i>
<i>-World War I?</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:37.215
<i>-Where did that come from?</i>
-<i>Where is this going?</i>

28:37.799 --> 28:40.844
<i>-Go ahead. Please continue.</i>
<i>-[Juawana] I didn't make this up!</i>

28:40.927 --> 28:46.891
<i>It says, "After World War I, the idea</i>
<i>of the working woman became popular."</i>

28:46.975 --> 28:48.727
<i>Did women start cocktail parties?</i>

28:48.810 --> 28:51.271
<i>-Probably.</i>
<i>-Probably, we love drinks after work.</i>

28:51.354 --> 28:53.314
<i>But keep going with your definition.</i>

28:53.398 --> 28:57.026
<i>Example number one</i>
<i>of trying to micromanage.</i>

28:57.110 --> 28:58.862
<i>We all know what cocktail-wear is.</i>

28:58.945 --> 29:00.989
<i>Spare us the dictionary reading.</i>

29:01.656 --> 29:07.579
<i>So we just want to make sure that we're</i>
<i>dressed appropriately, not date attire.</i>

29:09.789 --> 29:12.083
<i>-[Alexis] Oh, did you see that?</i>
<i>-[Colony] I see that look!</i>

29:12.167 --> 29:14.335
<i>She had the eyes between me and you.</i>

29:14.419 --> 29:16.129
<i>-Clearly.</i>
<i>-Not club attire.</i>

29:16.212 --> 29:17.756
<i>Ooh! Karla!</i>

29:17.839 --> 29:21.885
<i>Not casual attire.</i>
<i>I'm just saying what it's not.</i>

29:21.968 --> 29:23.136
<i>Is it grandma attire?</i>

29:23.219 --> 29:24.888
<i>-[Karla] What?</i>
<i>-Ooh.</i>

29:24.971 --> 29:26.556
<i>Who y'all talking about?</i>

29:28.433 --> 29:30.518
<i>-I'm just asking.</i>
<i>-[Colony] We got it.</i>

29:30.602 --> 29:32.937
<i>-We know the assignment.</i>
<i>-We will deliver.</i>

29:33.021 --> 29:36.316
<i>-I will give you cocktail.</i>
<i>-[Tennille] What kind of tail you giving?</i>

29:36.399 --> 29:37.233
<i>[all laughing]</i>

29:37.317 --> 29:38.902
<i>Cocktail. Let's go back, stay focused.</i>

29:38.985 --> 29:42.363
<i>All right, ladies, I have things to do.</i>
<i>Is this meeting adjourned?</i>

29:42.447 --> 29:45.283
<i>Anne, you're gonna</i>
<i>cut the meeting short, ma'am?</i>

29:45.366 --> 29:48.286
<i>-I have things to do, people to see.</i>
<i>-What do you have to do?</i>

29:48.369 --> 29:49.621
<i>You got a lunch date?</i>

29:49.704 --> 29:51.206
<i>None of your business.</i>

29:51.289 --> 29:54.459
<i>-Ooh.</i>
<i>-Is everybody else ready to adjourn?</i>

29:54.542 --> 29:57.712
<i>-Because Anne can't make that choice.</i>
<i>-[Colony] I mean, I guess.</i>

29:57.796 --> 29:59.923
<i>If we're not talking about anything else.</i>

30:00.006 --> 30:01.382
