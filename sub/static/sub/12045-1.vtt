03:31.833 --> 03:34.416
Cheers!

03:42.958 --> 03:44.333
Excellent.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.500
Let's drink until we drop.

03:47.541 --> 03:49.375
Save something for your wife.

03:49.625 --> 03:52.458
Are you kidding?

03:52.916 --> 03:55.041
Alcohol revives me.

03:55.458 --> 03:58.083
The later it gets, the hornier I get.

03:59.958 --> 04:02.375
Another glass. A little sip.

04:05.541 --> 04:07.500
Tell me, Jane...

04:07.916 --> 04:09.125
What year are you in?

04:09.833 --> 04:10.708
4th year.

04:10.958 --> 04:12.875
A senior should know better.

04:13.333 --> 04:16.041
What are you doing with Tun?

04:16.375 --> 04:17.750
He's a hunk.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.416
You keep saying that.

04:20.916 --> 04:23.583
Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.

04:23.625 --> 04:24.750
Then breaking their hearts.

04:24.791 --> 04:27.416
Speaking of broken hearts...

04:28.041 --> 04:29.916
Remember the time...

04:29.958 --> 04:32.666
that girl left him a drunken mess.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.833
Her name was Kay.

04:36.083 --> 04:38.041
Ignore them.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.833
Wait. I have a question.

04:41.208 --> 04:43.083
How can a guy like you get married?

04:43.125 --> 04:44.833
What's wrong with me?

04:45.541 --> 04:48.250
After a long tiring day...

04:48.583 --> 04:50.416
I want to head home...

04:50.750 --> 04:53.166
to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.208
Not waste my life...

04:55.250 --> 04:58.333
partying with you losers.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.750
Not with me.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.750
A good man...

05:01.791 --> 05:04.833
who went whoring with me last night.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.791
Fooling around so soon?

05:09.166 --> 05:10.708
Here she comes.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.208
Quiet.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.875
What's so funny?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.041
Nothing.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.916
One last thing...

05:21.541 --> 05:23.291
One more glass!

05:43.291 --> 05:45.333
What are we listening to?

05:46.916 --> 05:48.833
Don't turn it off.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.250
It's beautiful.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.500
You guys seem tight.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.958
Do you meet often?

06:00.375 --> 06:01.916
What are you looking at?

06:02.458 --> 06:03.875
Beautiful you.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.375
What a sap.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.500
Are you hurt?

06:54.750 --> 06:55.750
Tun...

06:56.958 --> 06:57.875
Is she dead?

07:07.416 --> 07:08.333
Wait!

07:18.583 --> 07:19.666
Drive away.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.166
I said drive away!

07:23.583 --> 07:25.333
Drive away!

07:35.875 --> 07:37.666
Get closer, please.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.291
Okay.

07:40.208 --> 07:41.791
Big smile, Nuch.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.166
Or you won't look pretty.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.458
All Science Majors...

07:54.500 --> 07:56.666
gather for a class photo.

07:57.458 --> 07:58.750
They're calling you.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.791
Where's Jane?

08:02.291 --> 08:04.958
Taking photos with her friends.

08:05.791 --> 08:08.833
I thought maybe you broke up.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.583
Come! Let's go.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.583
I phoned but you didn't pick up.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.375
Was it on silent?

09:21.416 --> 09:23.666
Nuch asked about you today.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.958
When will you be free?

09:29.250 --> 09:30.958
She wants to...

09:53.083 --> 09:54.041
Jane.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.750
How can you act like this?

10:01.791 --> 10:04.291
Pretending nothing happened.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.416
Since that night...

10:07.458 --> 10:09.166
I haven't slept soundly.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.583
I'm upset as well.

10:17.458 --> 10:20.166
At least we should have checked.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.916
It was an accident.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.958
That's easy for you to say.

10:28.666 --> 10:31.041
You weren't behind the wheel...

10:43.000 --> 10:44.583
Hi, Ti. / Hey.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.958
How's business?

10:47.375 --> 10:49.416
With you here this early...

10:49.750 --> 10:51.833
business should be bad.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.458
Are my prints ready?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.416
Yeah. Just a sec.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.083
Here.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.291
Is your processor broken?

11:31.583 --> 11:32.833
Let's see.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.125
The nerve.

11:39.416 --> 11:41.166
Nice prints and you're great.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.666
If they suck it's my fault.

11:43.958 --> 11:46.041
Let's check the negative.

11:46.375 --> 11:47.583
No way.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.416
I took them. I should know.

11:49.666 --> 11:50.666
We'll see.

11:53.125 --> 11:54.125
See.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.833
Your negatives are bad.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.458
Tun.

12:33.333 --> 12:34.166
Tun.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.333
Tun.

12:55.666 --> 12:57.291
Can you hear me?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Help!

15:08.666 --> 15:09.875
Help!

15:44.083 --> 15:46.833
Don't be scared. I'm here now.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.583
What's wrong with your camera?

16:10.083 --> 16:11.541
I don't know.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.791
The whole roll is ruined.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.375
That many?

16:23.375 --> 16:25.250
What are these shadows?

16:26.041 --> 16:27.833
My camera must be broken.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.125
How should I tell Nuch?

16:35.875 --> 16:36.750
Tun...

16:38.666 --> 16:40.291
Look at this picture.

16:51.708 --> 16:52.958
That woman...

16:54.208 --> 16:55.750
Do you think she's dead?

16:56.458 --> 16:57.791
That's enough.

17:03.958 --> 17:06.083
I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.

18:10.375 --> 18:11.166
Tun...

18:11.416 --> 18:13.041
Look at this picture.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.666
Are you sure it was here?

18:47.041 --> 18:48.125
Excuse me.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.416
What happened?

18:50.958 --> 18:53.541
A few days ago a car hit the billboard.

18:53.583 --> 18:55.166
Must have been drunk.

18:56.958 --> 18:59.041
Was anyone hurt?

19:00.125 --> 19:01.125
No.

19:01.916 --> 19:03.208
Just the broken sign.

19:03.250 --> 19:04.416
Are you sure?

19:05.041 --> 19:06.083
What?

19:07.875 --> 19:09.291
Nothing.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.750
Thank you.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.916
What?

19:17.125 --> 19:19.833
You sure you checked everywhere?

19:23.166 --> 19:24.166
Nothing.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.666
Thanks anyways.

19:31.375 --> 19:34.458
He called every precinct and hospital.

19:35.541 --> 19:39.083
No accidents were reported that night.

19:39.583 --> 19:41.166
That's not possible.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.250
What about the girl we hit?

19:45.750 --> 19:48.291
You sure he called every one?

19:48.750 --> 19:50.708
Maybe someone helped her.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.166
Maybe she's fine.

19:53.208 --> 19:54.833
How could she be fine?

19:54.875 --> 19:56.875
We ploughed her down.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.875
And even if she's fine...

20:03.125 --> 20:05.041
Something is in those pictures.

20:05.458 --> 20:08.250
I told you they're not related to her.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.041
They're just bad exposures.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.125
Get it?

21:15.333 --> 21:16.333
Tun...

21:17.000 --> 21:19.250
You need to make some merit.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.333
These pictures...

21:21.958 --> 21:24.666
show that a spirit is haunting you.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.500
How long have you been a photographer?

21:33.541 --> 21:35.250
Why are you showing me these?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.666
I know...

21:37.000 --> 21:39.875
But don't you find these shadows strange?

21:41.916 --> 21:43.625
You want to see spirits?

21:44.166 --> 21:45.666
I'll show you some.

21:53.791 --> 21:54.750
Here.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.666
Auntie Cham's spirit.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.166
You know where she is now?

22:01.958 --> 22:05.166
She's selling grilled bananas next door.

22:06.708 --> 22:08.375
Here's Auntie Cham. And here.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.416
All Auntie Cham.

22:10.458 --> 22:11.875
Taken on the same day.

22:12.208 --> 22:13.708
They're just double exposures...

22:14.041 --> 22:15.333
and out of focus.

22:16.333 --> 22:19.333
Come on. I know that.

22:27.666 --> 22:30.333
Everyone is familiar with this place.

22:31.416 --> 22:34.291
Just an ordinary location...

22:35.333 --> 22:36.750
that we pass...

22:37.458 --> 22:39.583
and see everyday.

22:44.875 --> 22:47.000
Now look at these pictures...

22:50.916 --> 22:54.250
taken of the same place.

22:54.625 --> 22:55.833
In these...

22:57.708 --> 22:59.291
the bridge looks nicer.

23:01.125 --> 23:04.416
That means photography...

23:04.833 --> 23:08.041
does not reproduce reality.

23:09.833 --> 23:11.500
It depends on how...

23:12.125 --> 23:15.083
the image is framed.

23:15.458 --> 23:17.125
What is revealed.

23:17.416 --> 23:19.291
What is concealed.

23:20.416 --> 23:23.250
Your perspective is critical.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.458
<i>Special Scoop: Spirit Pictures</i>

23:51.375 --> 23:52.875
Jane, you're early.

23:54.958 --> 23:56.708
I'll get it.

24:02.291 --> 24:04.083
Hello? / Hello, Tun.

24:04.416 --> 24:06.625
It's Jane. I'll come by later.

24:07.625 --> 24:08.541
Hello?

24:08.833 --> 24:11.083
Tun, can you hear me?

24:11.666 --> 24:12.750
Hello?

24:12.791 --> 24:13.750
Tun!

24:14.291 --> 24:15.250
Tun!

24:15.541 --> 24:16.583
Hello?

24:17.750 --> 24:18.708
Hello?

24:47.458 --> 24:48.625
What's wrong?

24:49.500 --> 24:50.750
I don't know.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.375
My neck's hurt since the accident.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.250
You should go see a doctor.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.583
I'm sure it's not serious.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.875
What's the use of talking to these spoofs?

25:06.083 --> 25:09.375
<i>Real Ghosts</i>

25:11.458 --> 25:12.833
Are you a reporter?

25:13.083 --> 25:14.125
No.

25:15.416 --> 25:18.208
The funeral foundation sent us.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.833
We run a legal operation.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.416
We have all the right permits.

26:14.083 --> 26:15.375
Excuse me.

26:15.750 --> 26:18.250
Are all these pictures fakes?

26:19.708 --> 26:22.541
Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.958
Everyone fakes them.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.333
You know...

26:29.375 --> 26:31.666
these photos are always a hit.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.166
Any issue with them sells out.

26:35.916 --> 26:36.750
But you think...

26:37.333 --> 26:39.541
we can always find real ones?

26:41.500 --> 26:44.000
Isn't that deceiving the public?

26:45.250 --> 26:47.333
Our readers...

26:47.708 --> 26:50.083
want to see scary photos.

26:51.041 --> 26:53.041
They don't want love stories.

26:54.625 --> 26:58.208
Does that mean every photo is fake?

27:01.333 --> 27:03.750
I didn't say that.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.250
Take a look.

27:19.416 --> 27:20.541
See anything?

27:21.666 --> 27:24.583
This is the first photo I had.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.875
I took it at home.

27:28.541 --> 27:30.041
The shadow...

27:30.083 --> 27:32.708
bears a likeness to my mom.

27:36.166 --> 27:38.500
Believe what you will.

27:40.208 --> 27:41.583
But this picture...

27:42.333 --> 27:45.000
was taken after she passed away.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.416
You know...

27:48.875 --> 27:49.916
sometimes...

27:50.208 --> 27:53.041
spirits long for their loved ones.

27:59.333 --> 28:00.958
In my opinion...

28:01.583 --> 28:03.333
these pictures...

28:04.125 --> 28:06.208
represent more than...

28:06.250 --> 28:08.875
macabre urban legends.

28:10.666 --> 28:13.250
They are signs.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.250
Think about it.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.291
Why would the dead...

28:22.958 --> 28:25.166
return to the living...

28:28.083 --> 28:31.375
without a message to convey?

28:35.416 --> 28:37.083
Most importantly...

28:37.833 --> 28:39.708
I believe...

28:40.375 --> 28:41.666
these shadows...

28:42.708 --> 28:45.958
are related to someone in the picture.

28:49.541 --> 28:51.000
A father...

28:51.375 --> 28:52.333
mother...

28:52.791 --> 28:54.333
or lover.

28:56.333 --> 28:57.833
Or someone...

28:58.333 --> 29:00.166
you maligned in life.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.791
How can we tell if they're real...

29:27.041 --> 29:28.333
and not fakes?

29:28.875 --> 29:32.000
What about polaroids?

29:35.416 --> 29:36.750
Can you fake them?

29:37.583 --> 29:39.875
You load the film and press the shutter.

29:40.375 --> 29:42.000
The photo ejects.

30:00.375 --> 30:02.291
Tell me then...

30:03.125 --> 30:05.125
How can they be faked?

30:09.083 --> 30:12.000
How do we know what they want?

30:12.458 --> 30:13.458
Perhaps...

30:13.708 --> 30:16.458
the answer is in the photo.

30:26.416 --> 30:28.708
Two more poses.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.000
Big smiles.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.333
Let's have a different pose.

30:38.250 --> 30:41.166
Embrace her, hold the bouquet...

30:41.208 --> 30:43.583
and kiss her cheek.

30:45.916 --> 30:47.250
Beautiful.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.666
We're done.

30:51.041 --> 30:53.750
Thank you both.

30:54.125 --> 30:56.666
Take them to the dressing room.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.333
What the...

31:25.958 --> 31:27.416
Who's doing that?

31:27.875 --> 31:29.625
Aum, check the fuse!

31:31.375 --> 31:32.666
Hey! Aum!

31:38.166 --> 31:39.666
Who's doing that?

31:40.791 --> 31:42.875
Is it you, Aum?

31:49.333 --> 31:50.291
Who is it?

31:53.333 --> 31:54.833
Who's there!

31:56.958 --> 31:58.416
I asked who it is!

32:09.125 --> 32:11.583
Where are you, Aum?

32:15.958 --> 32:16.958
Who's there!

33:09.083 --> 33:10.458
Please step off the scale.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.541
Step on it again.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.000
Been working hard lately?

33:26.583 --> 33:27.875
Not really.

33:28.666 --> 33:30.250
How long has it hurt?

33:30.833 --> 33:32.666
For quite awhile.

33:32.708 --> 33:35.291
But it's gotten worse lately.

33:36.208 --> 33:38.000
I had a car accident.

33:38.291 --> 33:39.708
An accident?

33:40.333 --> 33:42.708
Physically, you're fine.

33:43.458 --> 33:45.083
You shouldn't worry.

33:45.666 --> 33:48.791
But it really hurts.

33:49.666 --> 33:52.125
Your x-rays are normal.

33:52.375 --> 33:54.166
It may be a sprain.

33:54.208 --> 33:56.833
Try the medicine I prescribed.

33:57.875 --> 34:00.041
Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.583
Take this medicine...

34:05.625 --> 34:08.583
3 times a day after meals...

34:08.625 --> 34:10.958
until the prescription runs out.

34:12.791 --> 34:14.458
Lying bastard.

34:15.541 --> 34:16.500
Pardon?

34:16.541 --> 34:17.458
Yes?

34:18.875 --> 34:20.541
Nothing.

34:25.291 --> 34:27.041
Lying bastard.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.791
Lying bastard.

34:31.333 --> 34:32.958
As for this medicine...

34:34.125 --> 34:35.500
Sir!

34:35.875 --> 34:37.791
What's wrong?

34:40.791 --> 34:42.708
...is rarely seen.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.041
When grasshoppers begin mating...

34:46.083 --> 34:49.583
the male smells the female...

34:49.916 --> 34:54.083
from a distance up to 100 meters.

34:54.500 --> 34:58.125
The male carefully approaches the female.

34:59.166 --> 35:02.750
It hooks itself onto her belly.

35:03.166 --> 35:05.250
And they begin to mate.

35:06.500 --> 35:10.541
The female's response is surprising.

35:11.666 --> 35:15.458
The male becomes her prey.

35:15.791 --> 35:19.791
She slowly eats off his head...

35:20.541 --> 35:23.083
while they are mating.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.916
Eventually...

35:25.958 --> 35:28.500
the male succumbs to death.

35:37.458 --> 35:40.791
Excuse me, where is Room 301?

35:52.666 --> 35:53.625
Jane.

36:03.916 --> 36:04.875
Jane.

37:17.125 --> 37:18.250
Who's there?

37:48.333 --> 37:49.291
Tonn...

37:50.291 --> 37:52.000
What's wrong?

37:55.375 --> 37:56.333
Tun...

37:56.583 --> 37:57.791
I'm going to die.

37:58.458 --> 38:00.208
What's going on?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.041
The photos...

38:03.458 --> 38:05.208
Bring me those photos.

38:05.958 --> 38:07.333
What photos?

38:07.375 --> 38:08.666
Are you drunk?

38:10.458 --> 38:11.666
Those photos...

38:12.416 --> 38:13.666
Where did you hide them?

38:13.916 --> 38:15.208
Give them to me.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.916
Remember that bitch.

38:18.958 --> 38:20.333
Calm down.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.166
What photos?

38:22.416 --> 38:24.208
Just give them to me!

38:24.458 --> 38:26.458
Please calm down.

38:27.375 --> 38:29.208
Tonn, calm down.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
What photos?

38:36.416 --> 38:37.458
Tonn.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.833
I'll call your wife.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.333
What are you doing?

39:27.166 --> 39:28.750
Cleaning up.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.583
Your neck still sore?

39:38.750 --> 39:39.958
Yeah.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.583
Take it easy. Don't work so much.

44:23.375 --> 44:25.875
Natrenapa Chan-ngam, Honor Society 1995

44:38.125 --> 44:39.166
Tonn.

44:40.458 --> 44:41.708
It's Tun.

44:43.666 --> 44:45.041
Are you home?

44:59.875 --> 45:00.916
Tonn.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.958
Are you home?

45:14.208 --> 45:15.250
Tonn.

45:41.458 --> 45:43.041
Natrenapa Chan-ngam

46:31.416 --> 46:32.375
Tonn!

46:33.791 --> 46:34.750
Tonn!

46:36.750 --> 46:37.708
Tonn!

46:45.458 --> 46:47.166
Tonn!

47:25.041 --> 47:26.750
I'm really sorry.

47:27.833 --> 47:29.125
Do you know...

47:29.458 --> 47:31.208
what was bothering him?

47:35.166 --> 47:36.791
No. Suddenly he...

47:36.833 --> 47:39.625
It's your gang's fault.

47:41.708 --> 47:43.375
Have you all gone insane?

47:44.875 --> 47:46.750
What do you mean?

47:47.666 --> 47:50.166
You've all committed suicide.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.416
Who?

47:53.916 --> 47:55.500
Don't you know?

47:55.833 --> 47:57.458
The other two...

47:57.750 --> 47:59.666
also killed themselves.

48:00.708 --> 48:02.083
Which two?

48:05.375 --> 48:09.041
The two who sat next to you.

48:55.458 --> 48:57.291
Who's this woman?

49:01.625 --> 49:03.125
Where did you get that?

49:04.375 --> 49:07.041
She's the shadow in the photos, right?

49:08.125 --> 49:09.708
Who is she?

49:12.541 --> 49:14.666
How is she related to you?

49:33.708 --> 49:35.875
I knew her in college.

49:38.916 --> 49:40.375
Her name is Natre.

49:44.208 --> 49:46.125
She was a quiet person...

49:48.291 --> 49:49.541
without any friends.

49:53.750 --> 49:56.166
We all thought she was weird.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.958
I felt sorry for her.

50:10.375 --> 50:13.208
We dated but I kept it secret.

50:16.333 --> 50:18.166
She loved me a lot.

53:16.083 --> 53:18.583
She threatened to slit her wrists.

53:19.750 --> 53:21.833
I didn't know what to do.

53:21.875 --> 53:24.083
My friends thought it was funny.

53:24.125 --> 53:26.375
How were they involved?

53:26.416 --> 53:28.083
Why are they dead?

53:28.416 --> 53:29.166
They...

53:29.666 --> 53:31.333
What did they do?

53:33.541 --> 53:35.000
I don't know.

53:36.625 --> 53:39.208
Tonn said he'd take care of it.

53:42.666 --> 53:45.166
After that, Natre disappeared.

53:46.375 --> 53:48.625
I never saw her again.

53:49.666 --> 53:52.333
Didn't you try to stop them?

53:54.000 --> 53:56.375
How could you let it happen?

54:03.625 --> 54:05.625
What could I do?

54:07.791 --> 54:09.916
Now everyone is dead.

54:13.458 --> 54:14.500
I'm...

54:15.333 --> 54:17.250
I'm going to die next.

54:57.208 --> 54:58.708
It's funny how...

55:00.958 --> 55:03.458
we always say...

55:03.875 --> 55:06.541
if we could turn back time...

55:07.583 --> 55:08.750
we...

55:08.791 --> 55:11.416
we would reverse all our wrongs.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.583
Do you think she's okay?

55:17.666 --> 55:19.625
Will she be there?

55:19.666 --> 55:20.916
Go to sleep.

55:23.416 --> 55:25.416
I'll keep you company tonight.

57:34.916 --> 57:36.458
Excuse me.

57:37.583 --> 57:39.416
Do you have any toilet paper?

58:15.583 --> 58:17.166
Can I poo first?

58:17.208 --> 58:18.250
I'm sorry.

59:30.583 --> 59:32.000
What's bothering you?

59:47.041 --> 59:48.291
What's wrong?

01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:01.250
What is it?

01:00:55.625 --> 01:00:57.708
Is it around here?

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:09.916
Excuse me.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:11.708
Do you know where this is?

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:18.458
Mom, where is this house?

01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:54.666
Ma'am.

01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:09.333
Excuse me...

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:11.333
Is this Natre's house?

01:02:12.916 --> 01:02:14.333
What do you want?

01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:16.458
Well...

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:19.291
We're her friends.

01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:22.916
Natre's friends? Come inside.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.541
Have some water. You must be tired.

01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:38.791
Did you drive from Bangkok?

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.000
Yes.

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:48.041
We'd like to ask about Natre.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.000
She's not feeling well.

01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:53.291
She's taking a nap.

01:02:54.416 --> 01:02:56.125
Should I wake her?

01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:02.250
Stay for dinner.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:04.333
I was about to cook.

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:07.166
I'm making her favorite dish.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:10.708
Natre will be so happy.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:13.000
Her friends don't visit often.

01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:15.000
Wait right here.

01:03:34.666 --> 01:03:36.041
Where are you going?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.458
How dare you?

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:03.541
Did she commit suicide?

01:05:08.458 --> 01:05:10.791
We should cremate her.

01:05:12.958 --> 01:05:14.041
No.

01:05:14.083 --> 01:05:15.875
I won't cremate her.

01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:19.125
Ma'am...

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.750
I don't know if you believe such things...

01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:27.541
but I'd like you to look at these photos.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:32.208
They were taken around campus.

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:37.166
Some of the places...

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:40.583
were rooms Natre had been in.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.125
And these shadows appeared.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.500
I think that...

01:05:51.708 --> 01:05:55.208
Natre's spirit is restless.

01:05:56.666 --> 01:05:57.833
Natre...

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.250
My dear Natre.

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:07.666
Why don't you visit me?

01:06:16.458 --> 01:06:19.166
Can you tell me what happened?

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:21.625
Why she left Bangkok?

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:31.541
Ma'am...

01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:35.000
Ma'am.

01:06:36.666 --> 01:06:38.541
These shadows...

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:42.666
might mean her spirit is not at peace.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.666
We should hold her funeral.

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:52.000
Please.

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.625
When she came home...

01:07:08.666 --> 01:07:10.125
she seemed different.

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.458
She wouldn't talk to anyone.

01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:15.333
No one knows what happened in Bangkok.

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:19.416
Then she overdosed on pills.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.750
Luckily, her mother found her...

01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:25.041
and got her to the hospital on time.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.875
When she recovered...

01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:32.250
she climbed on the hospital roof...

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.625
and jumped off the edge.

01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:39.666
Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:45.291
She's been distraught ever since Natre's death.

01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:49.416
No matter what she refused to cremate her.

01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:53.333
All the villagers were scared.

01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:56.791
No one wanted to socialize with her.

01:10:04.291 --> 01:10:05.708
Can't sleep?

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:13.958
Tell me the truth...

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.583
Did you love Natre?

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:22.541
I tried to...

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:31.791
I believed that one day I would.

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:39.708
But I was fooling myself.

01:10:47.666 --> 01:10:49.541
When I broke it off...

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.333
I was a total asshole.

01:10:59.416 --> 01:11:01.750
But she still loved me the same.

01:11:08.291 --> 01:11:10.250
I want this to be over.

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:14.583
If she wants me to die I will.

01:11:15.958 --> 01:11:17.666
Don't say that.

01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:20.583
It's almost over.

01:11:21.791 --> 01:11:23.208
No it's not.

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:30.833
I know she'll come for me.

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:32.875
Tun.

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:35.791
We've come this far.

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:40.208
And you're sorry for what you did.

01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:42.666
I'm sure she knows.

01:11:44.958 --> 01:11:47.291
Don't talk about death anymore.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.416
I'm sorry.

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:03.541
Do you still love me?

01:12:09.416 --> 01:12:12.000
No matter what you won't leave me, right?

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:56.750
Jane.

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:58.083
Jane.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.125
Tun...

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:37.666
Jane...

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:39.916
Where did you go?

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:42.458
Why did you leave me alone?

01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:45.291
We've got to leave.

01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:50.000
Asshole!

01:15:51.291 --> 01:15:52.958
Why did you leave me?

01:15:53.208 --> 01:15:54.916
Didn't you love me?

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:56.833
How could you leave me?

01:15:59.916 --> 01:16:02.500
How could you leave me?

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:46.375
Tun...

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:48.750
Are you feeling better?

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.166
What happened last night?

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:55.708
Tun...

01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:58.500
Jane...

01:17:58.833 --> 01:18:00.041
Jane...

01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:08.708
The abbot said...

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.041
Natre will be cremated today.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.083
It's over.

01:20:16.708 --> 01:20:18.750
Hello. / Hello, Jane.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.583
Picking up photos?

01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:22.083
Where's Tun?

01:20:22.125 --> 01:20:23.333
He's busy.

01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:24.833
Good.

01:20:25.166 --> 01:20:26.500
When he's busy...

01:20:26.541 --> 01:20:27.958
I get to see you.

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.958
You went on vacation?

01:20:38.541 --> 01:20:40.166
To the beach.

01:20:40.208 --> 01:20:41.708
When did you go?

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:44.000
Last week.

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:48.916
This photo is...

01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:53.291
What's wrong?

01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:00.583
You look fatter.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.250
I didn't recognize you.

01:21:07.375 --> 01:21:08.500
Hi.

01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:10.625
Jumbo prints.

01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:13.625
Write your name, please.

01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:01.166
Get her guys!

01:24:38.375 --> 01:24:39.375
Jane...

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:41.958
Why are you crying?

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.750
Asshole...

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.250
How could you be so cruel?

01:24:56.583 --> 01:24:57.875
Where did you find these?

01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:02.375
If I didn't find them...

01:25:02.625 --> 01:25:05.208
I'd be a fool forever, right?

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:12.583
Let me explain.

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.833
What's there to say?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.083
I always believed you.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.166
I thought I knew you.

01:25:47.666 --> 01:25:48.875
Tun.

01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:51.333
Take her picture...

01:25:51.375 --> 01:25:52.666
so she doesn't blab.

01:25:53.125 --> 01:25:55.083
Tun, help me.

01:25:56.708 --> 01:25:58.250
I know it was wrong.

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.666
Take her picture now!

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.000
What's wrong!

01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:07.208
I'm your buddy!

01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:08.916
Hurry!

01:26:17.666 --> 01:26:19.875
Tun, help me.

01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:35.500
I never forgave myself.

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:37.500
But I was young and stupid.

01:26:39.041 --> 01:26:40.583
I've heard enough.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.458
I'm going home.

01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:42.666
Come on out!

01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:48.833
Where are you?

01:27:55.916 --> 01:27:57.750
I thought you loved me!

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:02.041
Loved me so much!

01:28:09.583 --> 01:28:11.833
Till death do us part!

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:18.958
She's gone now.

01:30:02.666 --> 01:30:03.750
Sometimes...

01:30:03.791 --> 01:30:05.873
spirits long for their loved ones.
