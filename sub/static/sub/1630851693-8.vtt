WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:04.413
<i>Previously on
The Other Way...</i>

00:13.379 --> 00:16.413
We can finally be married.
Best day ever!

00:26.793 --> 00:28.000
I mean,
they're gonna come in

00:28.034 --> 00:30.620
and start telling me how to
live my life in my own house?

00:30.655 --> 00:32.896
I might have a little bit
of a problem with that.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.965
Asking me to
let his parents come
and live with me?

00:40.241 --> 00:40.931
Hell no.

00:42.965 --> 00:45.068
<i>I'm glad that
you're there for him,</i>

00:45.103 --> 00:47.275
<i>but I was just curious,
like, if you guys were,</i>

00:47.310 --> 00:49.965
<i>like, talking about
infidelity and stuff.</i>

00:50.000 --> 00:51.517
<i>Hiromi is right.</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:54.551
I can't ignore
Victor's affair forever.

00:55.862 --> 00:58.103
I am not a virgin.

01:01.586 --> 01:04.137
<i>Alina's mom
is visiting us in Turkey,</i>

01:04.172 --> 01:07.068
<i>but if Alina tells her mom
what went down between us,</i>

01:07.103 --> 01:08.793
she's gonna hate me
from the start.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.344
I have to go.

01:32.620 --> 01:36.551
It wasn't actually just,
like, a one-night thing.

01:36.586 --> 01:38.206
You know,
she was my girlfriend.

01:43.379 --> 01:44.931
I don't know
what to say right now.

01:44.965 --> 01:46.034
Pack up your things

01:46.068 --> 01:48.103
because I'm not gonna put up
with this anymore.

02:07.931 --> 02:09.034
Hi, Deepali.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.655
I'm fine. How are you?
I missed you.

02:15.275 --> 02:19.034
<i>Just a few days ago,
Sumit's mom proposed
that she and his dad</i>

02:19.068 --> 02:21.931
should move in together
with me and Sumit.

02:21.965 --> 02:24.586
Let's go find, like, a little
cafe or some place to sit.

02:25.551 --> 02:28.758
And to me,
that's absolutely crazy

02:28.793 --> 02:30.137
to even think about that.

02:31.517 --> 02:32.620
No.

02:32.655 --> 02:34.551
Me and Sumit have
eaten here before.

02:34.586 --> 02:36.000
It's very good, the rolls...

02:39.103 --> 02:42.034
Deepali is my best
female friend in India.

02:42.068 --> 02:45.241
Actually, she's my only
female friend in India.

02:45.275 --> 02:48.517
<i>She is actually Sumit's
friend Rohit's sister</i>

02:48.551 --> 02:51.206
and her and I get along
very well together.

02:51.241 --> 02:54.517
As I tend to just get along
better with younger people

02:54.551 --> 02:55.724
than people my own age.

02:59.758 --> 03:01.448
Yes, sweet lassi.
- Okay.

03:07.137 --> 03:09.310
You know, with me and Sumit,
everything is great.

03:09.344 --> 03:11.758
Yeah.
- But I have to tell you that,

03:11.793 --> 03:13.793
um, we went
to a family counselor.

03:15.517 --> 03:18.241
We, we... we were saying...
just try to think, like,

03:18.275 --> 03:21.655
what can help get his parents
to understand and listen

03:21.689 --> 03:24.068
because, you know,
all his mom wants to do

03:24.103 --> 03:25.896
is yell and fight.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.310
Against.

03:41.482 --> 03:42.413
Thank you.

04:12.551 --> 04:14.482
There's always
a struggle with his mom,

04:14.517 --> 04:15.758
but you know what she said?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.827
She wants to come and live
with us in our house.

04:23.517 --> 04:24.586
"And I would train you

04:24.620 --> 04:26.586
how to become
a traditional Indian wife."

04:27.896 --> 04:30.689
What the problem is
I'm not a young Indian girl,

04:30.724 --> 04:32.724
so I don't need someone
to come and train me

04:32.758 --> 04:34.206
how to do things in my house.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.068
Well, you still have
to remember that
I am still an American.

05:04.827 --> 05:05.965
I mean, I should be.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.413
I'm just kinda, like...
Is she really...

05:08.448 --> 05:11.103
Does she really mean it
or is she just saying it?

05:11.137 --> 05:13.896
Or is she just trying to run
me out of India? Which is it?

05:16.586 --> 05:18.448
To get me away from
her son and out of India,

05:18.482 --> 05:20.793
and because of everything I've
already been through with her,

05:20.827 --> 05:23.379
and I've seen the hate
and anger on her face.

05:23.413 --> 05:25.793
So, it's hard for me
to believe her.

05:25.827 --> 05:27.517
For all I know she's thinking,

05:27.551 --> 05:29.413
"She won't be able
to handle it

05:29.448 --> 05:31.000
and she'll run back
to America,

05:31.034 --> 05:33.827
and I'll break them up,"
and she'll be, like, "Yes!

05:33.862 --> 05:37.413
I did it, I won,
and I have my son back now."

06:06.275 --> 06:07.896
Like a trial kind
of thing or...

06:11.344 --> 06:14.413
Maybe I am overthinking it.
Maybe I should give it a try.

06:14.448 --> 06:16.862
<i>I mean, if Sumit's mom
is really serious</i>

06:16.896 --> 06:20.000
and she's really trying
to get to know me better

06:20.034 --> 06:23.241
and get a relationship
with me, then sure,
let's try it.

06:32.241 --> 06:33.689
Deepali, I hope you're right.

06:35.689 --> 06:37.965
<i>But if they come to stay
with us for a few days</i>

06:38.000 --> 06:40.517
and his mom is just there
trying to bother us,

06:40.551 --> 06:42.827
<i>they need to leave
and go back home.</i>

06:42.862 --> 06:44.413
And there will be
no moving in.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.448
<i>Victor and I have
been staying at a hotel.</i>

07:08.482 --> 07:10.206
<i>It's kinda taking a toll on us</i>

07:10.241 --> 07:12.931
<i>and it's actually
super expensive.</i>

07:12.965 --> 07:14.379
Okay.
All right.

07:14.413 --> 07:16.310
<i>We want a home base.</i>

07:16.344 --> 07:18.931
Something with a kitchen,
so we can cook

07:18.965 --> 07:20.896
and save a little bit
of money.

07:20.931 --> 07:22.034
There we go.
Oh!

07:22.068 --> 07:24.517
This is pretty cool.

07:24.551 --> 07:28.000
<i>So we've decided
to rent an apartment
in San Andres.</i>

07:29.931 --> 07:30.586
Yeah.

08:13.482 --> 08:15.551
Whatever that cologne is
it's nice.

08:17.724 --> 08:20.103
Well, whatever,
it smells good.

08:20.137 --> 08:23.241
Moving in together
under these circumstances

08:23.275 --> 08:24.827
are kind of strange,

08:24.862 --> 08:28.000
<i>but at least
we can settle down</i>

08:28.034 --> 08:31.068
<i>and maybe we can actually
talk about things</i>

08:31.103 --> 08:33.275
that seemed important
before the hurricane.

08:36.034 --> 08:40.413
Um, so, like,
something that we need
to talk about a little bit...

08:42.482 --> 08:44.965
Originally, when I was
coming to Providence...

08:45.000 --> 08:46.793
- Yeah.
- Um,

08:46.827 --> 08:49.931
like, one of the things
I immediately wanted
to talk to you about

08:49.965 --> 08:52.172
was the whole
cheating incident.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.413
Yeah?

08:54.448 --> 08:56.241
And then,
of course, like,

08:56.275 --> 08:59.172
with the hurricane it kinda,
like, went on the back burner.

09:01.206 --> 09:03.310
We've only talked
about it on the phone,

09:03.344 --> 09:05.206
we've never talked
about it in person.

09:05.241 --> 09:05.931
Yeah.

09:08.172 --> 09:11.137
You actually moved in
with this person.

09:13.482 --> 09:16.724
You guys were talking about,
like, having kids.

09:16.758 --> 09:17.896
At least that's what she said.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.827
That's crazy.

09:23.344 --> 09:24.758
Is it, though?

09:24.793 --> 09:26.034
I don't know,
you have to, like,

09:26.068 --> 09:27.482
explain this to me
a little bit.

09:27.517 --> 09:28.965
I don't know,
I just, like...

09:29.793 --> 09:31.689
it was during the quarantine,

09:31.724 --> 09:34.448
and I didn't even mean
most of the things

09:34.482 --> 09:35.793
that we were talking about.

09:58.034 --> 10:00.310
When you were,
like, staying with her,

10:00.344 --> 10:01.896
was she supporting you?

10:04.655 --> 10:05.344
Yeah.

10:09.655 --> 10:12.793
I mean, she told me
you wanted her to

10:12.827 --> 10:14.724
buy you a motorcycle.

10:15.655 --> 10:16.620
No.

10:19.724 --> 10:21.413
'Cause you really
want a motorcycle.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.344
Well, you know what?

10:25.379 --> 10:27.275
Because you're
the one that lied.

10:30.758 --> 10:33.172
<i>The only reason
I found out was</i>

10:33.206 --> 10:35.448
because the girl
he was cheating on me with

10:35.482 --> 10:38.379
<i>messaged me, but before that,</i>

10:38.413 --> 10:40.896
I think he thought
he was gonna get away with it.

10:51.827 --> 10:53.827
<i>I don't think
he's using me for money.</i>

10:53.862 --> 10:56.448
<i>I feel like
he really loves me,</i>

10:56.482 --> 10:58.448
but of course,
it's in the back of my head

10:58.482 --> 11:02.586
because I've sent him money
to help him out in the past.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.862
But... maybe that's just
my own insecurities talking.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.827
I mean, I just don't know
if you realize, like,
how much that hurt me.

11:21.862 --> 11:24.862
Sometimes you just seem
so matter-of-fact about it.

11:26.068 --> 11:28.275
But, like, there was
somebody on the other end

11:28.310 --> 11:30.965
with kind of a broken heart,
you know?

11:32.413 --> 11:33.862
And it totally sucked.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.724
When you, like,
injure somebody like that

11:42.758 --> 11:45.482
it takes a while to,
like, fully recover.

11:48.586 --> 11:51.379
But I think, you know,
just, like, us being together,

11:51.413 --> 11:52.379
we can work on that.

12:03.586 --> 12:06.034
<i>I'm hoping that
this will be the last time</i>

12:06.068 --> 12:08.206
<i>that we talk
about the infidelity.</i>

12:08.241 --> 12:11.068
I really do want
to put that in the past

12:11.103 --> 12:13.103
'cause I don't want it
to be hanging over us.

12:17.965 --> 12:18.724
Here comes Ari.

12:19.103 --> 12:20.137
Hi!

12:21.172 --> 12:22.344
I really wish Bini was here.

12:22.379 --> 12:23.310
What are you doing?

12:27.310 --> 12:28.275
Okay.

12:28.310 --> 12:30.448
I'm worried that with Avi
and I so far away,

12:30.482 --> 12:32.137
<i>this could cause
problems for us.</i>

12:35.448 --> 12:38.000
I've been
thinking more of the, uh,

12:38.034 --> 12:39.275
idea of having a baby.

12:40.137 --> 12:41.689
A baby?

12:43.448 --> 12:46.448
People that are
approaching 60s
usually aren't having babies.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.310
We're just landing
in Germany now, in Frankfurt.

13:07.344 --> 13:09.965
And Avi is handling it
very, very well.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.827
Avi and I are heading
back to the U.S.,

13:13.862 --> 13:16.206
<i>so Avi can get
his surgery there.</i>

13:16.241 --> 13:19.827
Yeah! We're going to see
grandma and grandpa.

13:19.862 --> 13:22.758
- You're gonna see America
for the first time. Yeah!

13:24.068 --> 13:26.931
I haven't been back to
the US in, like, over a year.

13:27.896 --> 13:29.275
<i>It's a very surreal feeling.</i>

13:36.068 --> 13:38.034
Arriving flight, hooray.

13:39.827 --> 13:40.896
It's where Ari is.

13:41.793 --> 13:43.965
My baby's coming home
with the baby.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.793
- Yeah.
- The baby with the baby.

13:47.655 --> 13:50.620
Seven months have gone by
since I've seen her

13:50.655 --> 13:53.241
and seven months
since I've seen Avi.

13:53.275 --> 13:56.517
<i>It's been very difficult
for me not to talk to her</i>

13:56.551 --> 13:58.172
<i>all the time and, so...</i>

13:58.206 --> 14:00.344
This is a wonderful day
for me.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.068
Should we pull up there
for it?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.689
Pick the best spot.

14:04.724 --> 14:07.206
The best spot
is wherever Ari comes up.

14:12.931 --> 14:14.068
Here comes Ari.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.931
Roman, come out. Ari's here.

14:16.448 --> 14:18.172
Hi!

14:18.206 --> 14:19.413
Look how big he is.

14:19.448 --> 14:21.241
Look at
the size of him.

14:23.344 --> 14:25.275
<i>The only time that
I've seen Avi is</i>

14:25.310 --> 14:27.241
when we were
in Ethiopia in January.

14:27.275 --> 14:28.620
Do you know who I am?

14:28.655 --> 14:30.000
He says,
I don't even know who I am.

14:30.034 --> 14:31.655
- I've been flying
for 24 hours.

14:31.689 --> 14:37.000
I'll just enjoy, uh,
watching this, uh, wonderful
eight-month-old crawl,

14:37.034 --> 14:40.068
walk, babble, laugh, poop.

14:41.862 --> 14:42.793
- Hi, Ari.
- Hi, Mom.

14:42.827 --> 14:44.172
Oh, my God.
It's so good to see you.

14:44.206 --> 14:45.172
You guys look great.

14:45.206 --> 14:48.620
Oh, I love him so much!
It's your grandma!

14:48.655 --> 14:52.413
Do you recognize me
from the videos... video chat?

14:52.448 --> 14:53.724
I love you so much.

14:55.586 --> 14:56.827
Okay, are we ready?

15:02.275 --> 15:04.655
- How does it feel to be back?
It feels weird.

15:04.689 --> 15:06.068
Why?

15:06.103 --> 15:08.068
I don't know, the air is
different in New Jersey

15:08.103 --> 15:09.827
and, like, it's, like,
summer here.

15:09.862 --> 15:12.793
We never get this feeling
of summer in Ethiopia.

15:12.827 --> 15:15.413
What do you think
that you wanna do first

15:15.448 --> 15:16.517
when you get home?

15:16.551 --> 15:18.448
Oh, my God. So many things.

15:18.482 --> 15:21.344
We have to,
as soon as possible,
get his surgery and then,

15:21.379 --> 15:24.103
um, I wanna hang out
with you guys as much
as possible.

15:24.137 --> 15:26.241
See all the aunts
and uncles and cousins.

15:26.275 --> 15:28.034
We're gonna have to fight
over Avi, though.

15:28.068 --> 15:28.724
Yeah.

15:30.172 --> 15:34.344
<i>I'm excited to experience
life in the U.S. again.</i>

15:34.379 --> 15:37.241
But I really wish Bini
was here also, you know?

15:37.275 --> 15:39.655
<i>It would be a much more
complete experience</i>

15:39.689 --> 15:41.793
<i>and a better trip
if Bini was with us.</i>

15:43.344 --> 15:45.275
I wanna call Bini
and check in with him.

15:49.206 --> 15:50.862
- How are you?
- Hi, Biniyam.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.172
I'm here with my mom,
my dad, my nephew, Roman,

15:55.206 --> 15:56.241
and your little son.

15:58.137 --> 16:00.482
Avi's listening to your voice.
Say, "Hi, Avi!"

16:03.068 --> 16:04.068
We miss you.

16:05.413 --> 16:06.413
What are you doing?

16:09.862 --> 16:10.620
Okay.

16:15.034 --> 16:18.482
In the past, being
long distance has not been
good for our relationship.

16:19.551 --> 16:21.034
<i>I didn't really consider
that fact</i>

16:21.068 --> 16:23.620
<i>when I decided to come
to the US for Avi's surgery.</i>

16:25.275 --> 16:28.000
I'm worried that with Avi
and I so far away,

16:28.034 --> 16:31.034
<i>this could cause
a whole different set
of problems for us.</i>

16:32.413 --> 16:34.241
- We love you, all of us.

16:36.310 --> 16:38.655
He sounds better than
I thought he would be, Ari.

16:39.793 --> 16:40.655
Yeah, I know.

16:59.862 --> 17:00.827
Hannah?

17:12.344 --> 17:16.689
It's been like 15 years
since I really did nails.

17:17.896 --> 17:19.172
You miss
raising your kids?

17:20.724 --> 17:22.413
- Yeah. When they were
her age--
- Do you remember?

17:22.862 --> 17:25.103
Oh, yes. God.

17:25.137 --> 17:26.275
<i>Our wedding
is in two months</i>

17:26.310 --> 17:28.517
and now that we've picked
a date, I'm very excited

17:28.551 --> 17:30.206
to be planning all
the details for our wedding.

17:32.482 --> 17:33.310
You like?

17:36.448 --> 17:37.172
Ooh.

17:44.172 --> 17:45.206
Aww.

17:47.620 --> 17:48.379
Love you.

17:49.344 --> 17:50.620
- Bye.
- Thank you.

17:50.655 --> 17:52.655
Woo-hoo. We can
hit the club tonight.

17:56.103 --> 17:58.206
- Do you want some more
coffee real quick?
- Sure.

17:58.241 --> 18:00.103
Let me get us
a little more.

18:02.137 --> 18:04.482
<i>Even though
the wedding is looming large
in our life right now,</i>

18:05.827 --> 18:08.241
I can't help but to think
of my future with Kenny.

18:11.827 --> 18:12.931
Where's
your tip money?

18:13.517 --> 18:14.448
My pocket.

18:15.379 --> 18:16.896
Here,
you can hold on to mine.

18:18.862 --> 18:19.724
Cheers.

18:20.551 --> 18:21.931
- Love you.
- Love you.

18:24.551 --> 18:27.310
Babe,
so I've been thinking more...

18:27.344 --> 18:29.862
Sometimes, like,
I have felt like, um...

18:31.241 --> 18:33.620
An emptiness
or something's missing.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.310
Just feeling like
we're family and then...

18:36.344 --> 18:39.344
I've been thinking more
of the idea of adoption.

18:41.965 --> 18:42.793
Okay.

18:43.793 --> 18:45.206
And since
we last talked,

18:45.241 --> 18:47.034
I actually did do
some research

18:47.068 --> 18:50.413
and I'd like to pursue
it a little more.

18:53.517 --> 18:56.137
Adoption is something
we've been talking
on and off about.

18:56.172 --> 18:58.344
<i>Kenny was hesitant
because of his age,</i>

18:58.379 --> 19:00.103
<i>but I've been thinking
a lot about it</i>

19:00.137 --> 19:02.137
<i>after visiting my family
in San Felipe.</i>

19:02.172 --> 19:05.344
I have a large,
extended family and I've
always wanted more kids.

19:07.137 --> 19:08.448
Previously, I've mentioned,
you know,

19:08.482 --> 19:12.310
I'd like to adopt a child
close to Hannah's age,

19:12.344 --> 19:14.517
but the more
I think about it...

19:15.689 --> 19:19.344
I, I kinda...
like the idea of a baby.

19:20.896 --> 19:21.931
A baby?

19:27.379 --> 19:30.620
A baby is a lot, you know?
Like, remember having a baby?

19:30.655 --> 19:34.586
Like... the work
that goes into a newborn.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.965
People that are
approaching 60s
usually aren't having babies.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.103
Are you...

19:41.137 --> 19:44.482
Be honest with me,
are you kinda more inclined to

19:44.517 --> 19:46.689
this being something
you don't want?

19:49.620 --> 19:52.620
I can envision it.
I can see it.

19:52.655 --> 19:55.827
But I also know we have
to be logical about it.

19:58.172 --> 20:01.965
I'm just saying we just need
to, like, talk on it.

20:03.724 --> 20:09.379
I think having
a baby that's ours,

20:09.413 --> 20:11.586
like, maybe has your blood,
you know?

20:11.620 --> 20:13.275
Wait, what do you mean,
"My blood"?

20:14.379 --> 20:15.827
Like in vitro or something.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.551
Oh.

20:20.758 --> 20:22.137
Oh, you'd wanna go that route?

20:23.241 --> 20:24.655
I don't know. I kinda...

20:28.896 --> 20:31.068
I can't say
it'd be more special, but...

20:32.137 --> 20:33.724
it would in some ways.

20:42.724 --> 20:46.241
I really hadn't mentioned
in vitro to Kenny
because of his age.

20:46.275 --> 20:47.931
So thinking, you know,
about a baby

20:47.965 --> 20:50.310
I think that's even harder
to convince him.

20:50.344 --> 20:52.965
<i>In my view, like,
I want a part of Kenny.</i>

20:53.000 --> 20:55.620
Like, Hannah is mine,
she has my blood.

20:55.655 --> 20:59.724
And to grow our family,
I'd love, you know,
Kenny to donate his sperm

20:59.758 --> 21:02.655
<i>and we would have a baby
that's his blood</i>

21:02.689 --> 21:06.689
and I think it'd be beautiful
to, to have something of his.

21:08.482 --> 21:12.000
It's a very lovely thought,
you know, to have, uh,

21:12.965 --> 21:14.517
another child.

21:14.551 --> 21:20.620
I do love the idea of helping
a child that needs help now.

21:20.655 --> 21:24.068
I could see more so doing,
you know, a older kid

21:24.103 --> 21:25.896
if that could
work out somehow.

21:28.241 --> 21:30.862
<i>I think we'd make amazing
parents together</i>

21:30.896 --> 21:34.275
and I think we would give
a child a beautiful home.

21:34.310 --> 21:37.448
<i>But he's still young,
he's 32 years old</i>

21:37.482 --> 21:39.379
<i>and I'm 58.</i>

21:39.413 --> 21:43.655
So I have reservations,
you know, as you get older,

21:43.689 --> 21:45.241
you know, you don't know
what's gonna happen.

21:47.896 --> 21:50.275
You know, I never think about
the age thing at all.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.689
It never enters my mind.

21:52.413 --> 21:54.034
But with this it's kind of...

21:54.068 --> 21:55.793
It's kind of a hit in the face

21:56.655 --> 21:57.724
just thinking about...

22:00.448 --> 22:01.586
I don't know.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.310
Cause you get to a certain age
when you start thinking,

22:03.344 --> 22:05.620
you know, how much
is in my rearview mirror

22:05.655 --> 22:08.000
and how much of my life
is still ahead of me.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.586
Yeah.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.034
It's something for you
to think about, too,

22:11.068 --> 22:13.965
because I don't want
you to be left alone

22:15.206 --> 22:18.000
raising another child
without me.

22:18.793 --> 22:20.931
Yeah, but, I mean...

22:20.965 --> 22:23.103
I don't wanna think about
you being gone.

22:28.482 --> 22:30.551
It's just something that
we really have to,

22:32.586 --> 22:36.103
you know, weigh everything out
and really think about.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.517
Your age doesn't matter,
it's just a journey

22:38.551 --> 22:39.965
I'd like to start with you.

22:42.965 --> 22:44.793
<i>It does put
pressure on me</i>

22:44.827 --> 22:47.655
<i>to want to make
his dreams come true</i>

22:47.689 --> 22:49.862
because ultimately,
I always want to
make him happy

22:49.896 --> 22:51.827
and make his dreams come true.

22:51.862 --> 22:55.896
Um... But I really want him
to think about everything

22:55.931 --> 23:00.310
that goes into this
and how much is
involved with it.

23:00.344 --> 23:04.310
Like, I know I just threw
the whole in vitro thing
on you out of nowhere.

23:05.482 --> 23:06.827
I think we can
talk more about it.

23:08.379 --> 23:10.000
I'm not saying never.

23:10.034 --> 23:11.793
I'm just, you know,
you just hit me with it,

23:11.827 --> 23:14.241
so I have to think
and process that.

23:14.275 --> 23:16.620
We just have to take
it step by step.

23:16.655 --> 23:18.241
A lot to think about, babe.

23:36.965 --> 23:39.413
Sumit's parents are arriving
at the house tomorrow morning.

23:46.551 --> 23:47.482
No, thank you.

24:11.103 --> 24:12.344
Wow.

24:34.965 --> 24:36.862
Could I do one
of these frozen things?

24:36.896 --> 24:38.758
- Could I do like half mango?
- Yeah.

24:38.793 --> 24:39.724
And half banana?

24:42.862 --> 24:44.103
And what do you want, Anna?

24:46.896 --> 24:48.275
Thank you so much, sir.

24:48.310 --> 24:49.793
I'll just keep one menu
just in case.

25:13.517 --> 25:14.827
Um...

25:38.413 --> 25:40.862
It's not especially written,

25:40.896 --> 25:43.103
any of the negative side
effects of any of the things

25:43.137 --> 25:45.000
that we should abstain from.

25:45.034 --> 25:47.275
<i>But by taking care
of our bodies,</i>

25:47.310 --> 25:49.655
<i>we'll be blessed
with knowledge</i>

25:49.689 --> 25:52.275
and the angel of destruction
will pass by.

26:28.275 --> 26:29.034
Mmm-hmm.

26:33.482 --> 26:34.413
Mmm-hmm.

26:44.793 --> 26:45.862
Mmm-hmm.

27:08.862 --> 27:11.586
<i>I want Alina's
family to join the church.</i>

27:11.620 --> 27:13.620
I want everyone to join,
in the whole world,

27:13.655 --> 27:17.068
but especially them
because they're gonna
be my family.

27:18.241 --> 27:21.965
Ooh. Thank you so much.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.206
<i>So I decided just
to let her know that
I would be thrilled</i>

27:25.241 --> 27:29.241
if she were to convert
with Alina into the LDS faith.

31:14.103 --> 31:21.034
I was not expecting
that this would be
how lunchtime would go.

31:21.068 --> 31:24.965
<i>Alina told her mom
that I'm not a virgin</i>

31:25.000 --> 31:27.965
and Alina's mom is just...
pew, pew, pew.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.862
You know?

31:28.896 --> 31:31.000
Shooting questions at me
left and right.

31:31.034 --> 31:33.896
<i>I was hoping that Alina
and I could talk about this</i>

31:33.931 --> 31:35.965
<i>between each other before</i>

31:36.000 --> 31:37.310
<i>bringing it up with her mom...</i>

31:37.862 --> 31:38.965
In front of me.

32:08.965 --> 32:11.103
I didn't actually start
having actual, like,

32:11.137 --> 32:13.793
intercourse until I was,
like, probably like 23.

32:13.827 --> 32:16.896
And because obviously
I'm a believer
in abstinence also,

32:16.931 --> 32:18.344
like, abstinence is probably

32:18.379 --> 32:19.620
the best way
not to get pregnant.

32:19.655 --> 32:23.551
Like, only one girl's gotten
pregnant being abstinent.

32:23.586 --> 32:26.344
<i>But then once I stepped up,
it became a lot harder</i>

32:26.379 --> 32:30.724
to remain abstinent
because sex is...

32:31.275 --> 32:32.586
enjoyable, obviously.

32:33.551 --> 32:36.551
And it's kinda like
eating vegetables

32:36.586 --> 32:37.896
after you eat a candy bar.

35:16.586 --> 35:20.137
<i>Obviously,
she's feeling that
I should be better.</i>

35:21.344 --> 35:23.758
And she's right,
I should be better.

35:23.793 --> 35:30.103
<i>But I am really nervous
that all my promises to be
a better person to Alina,</i>

35:31.793 --> 35:33.896
no matter how many I make,

35:33.931 --> 35:38.068
won't be enough
to convince her to stay

35:38.103 --> 35:41.137
and that her mom's gonna
try to get her to go home
with her.

36:11.482 --> 36:12.344
Um...

36:52.241 --> 36:53.862
I live in a completely
different country

36:53.896 --> 36:56.275
than my whole entire everyone.

36:58.620 --> 37:00.689
All you wanna do is stand here
and argue and fight with me.

37:36.206 --> 37:38.275
<i>After talking
with Deepali,</i>

37:38.310 --> 37:41.379
me and Sumit did decide
that a good compromise

37:41.413 --> 37:44.275
would be to have his family
come and stay with us

37:44.310 --> 37:45.517
for just a couple of days.

37:46.620 --> 37:48.724
<i>And his parents
were fine with that.</i>

37:48.758 --> 37:52.448
Wow, that just barely,
barely fit through the door.

37:54.310 --> 37:57.448
Sumit's parents are arriving
at the house tomorrow morning,

37:57.482 --> 37:59.896
<i>so Sumit and I have
ordered some furniture</i>

37:59.931 --> 38:01.931
to be ready for them
in the guest room.

38:01.965 --> 38:03.034
Bye, thank you.

38:07.310 --> 38:08.965
Oh, yeah. Phew!

38:09.000 --> 38:12.517
I still think that by trying
to make me into

38:12.551 --> 38:14.413
a traditional Indian wife,

38:14.448 --> 38:17.862
<i>they're just trying
to manipulate me
and get me to fail.</i>

38:17.896 --> 38:19.275
<i>They know I'm gonna fail.</i>

38:19.310 --> 38:21.379
But Sumit keeps telling
me to stay positive,

38:21.413 --> 38:22.965
so that's
what I'm trying to do.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.758
Um, this is gonna be
your parents' room, right?

38:51.758 --> 38:52.448
Mmm-hmm.

38:54.931 --> 38:56.551
Okay.

38:56.586 --> 38:58.793
First of all I'm thinking,
"Why do I have to give up

38:58.827 --> 39:01.310
my bedroom when there's
a guest bedroom over here?"

39:01.344 --> 39:04.482
But in India,
anybody that comes
into their home

39:04.517 --> 39:07.517
is just, "Welcome.
This is your home.

39:07.551 --> 39:09.413
<i>Make yourself at home."</i>

39:09.448 --> 39:11.068
<i>I'm just hoping that
Sumit's mom</i>

39:11.103 --> 39:12.586
<i>won't actually want
to sleep in our bed.</i>

39:12.620 --> 39:14.413
I mean, no, thank you.

39:16.137 --> 39:18.275
Don't they have
a nicer house than we do?

39:18.310 --> 39:21.896
I'm surprised they didn't
call us to come and live there
with them.

39:27.586 --> 39:28.310
Yeah.

39:35.482 --> 39:38.896
I-- it just makes me feel like
if they're still trying
to hide everything,

39:38.931 --> 39:41.551
how do you think,
by them coming over here,

39:41.586 --> 39:44.344
that's gonna make them accept
our relationship more easily?

39:44.379 --> 39:45.931
How is that gonna help?

40:23.137 --> 40:25.344
I'm living my best life,
actually, right now.

40:25.379 --> 40:26.482
The best life I've ever lived.

40:27.931 --> 40:32.517
In America, I worked six days
a week, sometimes more.

40:32.551 --> 40:35.241
<i>I had a lot of bills,
had a lot of responsibility.</i>

40:35.275 --> 40:37.965
<i>Right now, I'm living the life
that I always dreamed of.</i>

40:38.827 --> 40:40.379
I can wake up when I want to.

40:40.413 --> 40:43.034
I get up and I do what
I want when I want to,

40:43.068 --> 40:45.689
<i>and I was under
the impression that</i>

40:45.724 --> 40:48.310
<i>Sumit was happy living
the way we live.</i>

40:49.896 --> 40:54.448
I mean, for me, it's gonna be
a major adjustment.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.172
I live in a completely
different country

41:05.206 --> 41:08.172
than my whole entire everyone.

41:08.206 --> 41:11.000
And you're talking about...
you can go visit your parents
at any time.

41:14.482 --> 41:15.413
No, you...

41:17.068 --> 41:18.551
You can miss your parents.

41:18.586 --> 41:21.068
You can miss your parents,
you can go visit them
any time.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.724
Can I go visit
my daughters any time?

41:25.103 --> 41:27.620
All you wanna do is stand here
and argue and fight with me.

41:27.655 --> 41:28.655
That's what you wanna do.

41:47.379 --> 41:49.000
Okay. Hmm.

42:13.275 --> 42:15.068
I'm gonna try here.

42:15.103 --> 42:20.000
But I'm just saying,
like, on me is very stressful.

42:55.103 --> 42:57.896
Hannah actually said
she wanted to come with us.

42:57.931 --> 42:59.965
But I just told her we had
some adult things to do.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.482
Yeah.

43:01.517 --> 43:03.137
I just don't think
it's the time to even
tell her anything

43:03.172 --> 43:04.620
or even mention anything.

43:04.655 --> 43:05.896
No. No.

43:05.931 --> 43:08.482
Until we're more sure
of what we're doing.

43:08.517 --> 43:11.241
<i>After our
conversation the other day
about growing our family</i>

43:11.275 --> 43:13.965
I still have
reservations about it.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.758
<i>But I will do my due diligence
and find out</i>

43:16.793 --> 43:18.310
what our chances are

43:18.344 --> 43:20.724
that we can adopt
and what it entails.

43:22.689 --> 43:25.724
I'm really happy
that you found this place

43:26.655 --> 43:28.344
and that they were receptive.

43:29.275 --> 43:30.965
Maybe it's a sign.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.965
I just wonder how hard it
is for same sex couples

43:34.000 --> 43:36.517
to even adopt any--
at all in Mexico.

43:37.827 --> 43:40.517
I've called
a few adoption agencies

43:40.551 --> 43:44.620
- and they all seem to be
more religious... managed?
- Based.

43:44.655 --> 43:45.827
Based.

43:45.862 --> 43:48.344
Um, 'cause I usually call,
and I have said

43:48.379 --> 43:50.896
that we're a same sex couple
and, you know, they...

43:50.931 --> 43:53.103
they're quick to
wanna hang up the phone.

43:53.137 --> 43:56.965
Um, there was one that did,
you know, answer
and they were nice.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.068
It was one that's privately
managed and it's all HIV kids.

44:02.103 --> 44:05.206
I'm sure there's more of
a need for children like these

44:05.241 --> 44:06.689
to have a home or find a home.

44:08.931 --> 44:11.241
You know, we have to look
at the medical side of it,

44:11.275 --> 44:13.724
obviously,
and what that entails.

44:13.758 --> 44:14.586
Yeah.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.965
There's a lot of questions
to ask.

44:19.551 --> 44:21.448
When Armando first told me
about the orphanage

44:21.482 --> 44:24.068
that has all these
HIV positive children...

44:24.793 --> 44:26.103
Oh, it's right here.

44:26.137 --> 44:28.413
<i>...there's all kinds
of things that
go through my head.</i>

44:28.448 --> 44:32.413
I actually came out right
before, um, HIV and AIDS

44:32.448 --> 44:35.655
was hitting all the big cities
in the United States

44:35.689 --> 44:37.413
and by the end of the '80s,

44:37.448 --> 44:39.965
I lost 80% of the people
I knew.

44:42.172 --> 44:44.206
Hearing that there is
this orphanage out there,

44:44.241 --> 44:47.103
that is helping,
um, children with HIV,

44:47.137 --> 44:48.551
it actually warms my heart,

44:48.586 --> 44:49.931
and it makes me
want to visit it,

44:49.965 --> 44:52.344
and it makes me want to see
what I can do to help.

44:52.379 --> 44:54.241
- Do we ring a bell or...
- Right there.

44:57.344 --> 44:58.413
I think it rang.

45:34.931 --> 45:38.482
Has she ever heard of
a same sex couple adopting?

45:57.793 --> 45:59.068
Okay.

45:59.103 --> 46:01.931
She's only heard of, like,
one case in Mexico City

46:01.965 --> 46:04.034
and here she knows
there's a lesbian couple.

46:48.344 --> 46:49.206
Okay.

46:53.068 --> 46:54.068
Okay.

46:54.103 --> 46:56.413
So the whole process
of adoption...

46:56.448 --> 46:57.965
she says, like, some...
you know,

46:58.000 --> 46:59.586
each case is different.

46:59.620 --> 47:03.068
She has, uh, one of the,
uh, girls that was adopted
from here,

47:03.103 --> 47:04.724
their process was four years.

47:05.241 --> 47:06.965
Wow.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.103
I completely understand that,
um... families and people,

47:11.137 --> 47:12.724
adults need to be vetted,

47:12.758 --> 47:16.310
you know, to make sure
that these kids will be
in good hands and good homes.

47:16.344 --> 47:19.275
Uh, I'm completely for it,
but part of me,

47:19.310 --> 47:22.000
<i>it seems like, it's gonna be
a lot, a lot,</i>

47:22.034 --> 47:23.689
<i>you know, to have
to go through</i>

47:23.724 --> 47:25.655
<i>with government stuff</i>

47:25.689 --> 47:27.413
and who knows
how many years down the line

47:27.448 --> 47:29.827
we would be able to adopt
and where we would be.

47:29.862 --> 47:31.068
<i>So it just makes me kinda,</i>

47:31.103 --> 47:33.931
you know,
question how long
the process is gonna take

47:33.965 --> 47:35.413
and if this is
the best way forward.

47:51.448 --> 47:52.206
Okay.

47:58.413 --> 47:59.068
Hi.

48:05.344 --> 48:06.068
Hi.

48:06.103 --> 48:08.344
- <i>Hola.
Hola.</i>

48:11.931 --> 48:13.172
Do you want to
give them stuff?

48:22.172 --> 48:24.793
When the kids ran over to us,
it was truly amazing.

48:27.137 --> 48:28.344
You're welcome.

48:28.758 --> 48:29.827
<i>De nada.</i>

48:32.103 --> 48:35.206
<i>Having come out
when HIV and AIDS
just went rampant,</i>

48:35.241 --> 48:37.965
friends were just dying
left and right.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.482
I don't know how many
funerals I went to.

48:40.517 --> 48:43.103
How many wakes
and memorials I went to.

48:45.827 --> 48:46.758
Go long.

48:48.068 --> 48:52.344
So actually, the thought of,
um... adopting a child

48:54.655 --> 48:58.310
with the same thing that was
a death sentence 30 years ago,

48:58.344 --> 49:01.379
and people
were shunning people,

49:01.413 --> 49:03.000
and didn't wanna be
near people,

49:03.034 --> 49:06.965
and family were disowning
their children that had it,

49:07.000 --> 49:11.517
I would love to now take
that child that's here today

49:11.551 --> 49:15.758
and embrace them and hug them
and support them

49:15.793 --> 49:17.689
and show them
how loved they are.

49:23.724 --> 49:27.310
There's a lot of concerns
about adopting
a child with HIV.

49:27.344 --> 49:29.137
<i>Um...</i>

49:29.172 --> 49:32.379
Are medications really
available here in Mexico,

49:32.413 --> 49:34.103
how will it affect Hannah,

49:34.137 --> 49:36.172
how will it affect
Armando's family

49:36.206 --> 49:39.379
and the stigma
around HIV in Mexico?

49:41.689 --> 49:44.379
But being here really
makes me wanna help one
of these children.

50:04.275 --> 50:05.310
Do you like it?

50:09.931 --> 50:12.137
- Oh, my God.
- Ain't that the sweetest
when he eats his own chicken?

50:12.172 --> 50:13.758
I'm so glad you guys are here.

50:13.793 --> 50:15.034
I know.

50:15.068 --> 50:16.827
<i>I've been back in New Jersey
for a couple of days,</i>

50:16.862 --> 50:18.517
<i>staying at my sister
Kristin's house</i>

50:18.551 --> 50:20.000
and it's been nice to be home.

50:20.586 --> 50:21.551
Avi!

50:21.586 --> 50:23.689
- My Avi!

50:23.724 --> 50:26.241
Oh, you're so excited
to see me.

50:26.275 --> 50:29.586
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Yeah!

50:29.620 --> 50:31.344
- Grandma and Grandpa!
- Oh, my God.

50:31.379 --> 50:33.689
- He's so cute,
I can't stand it.

50:33.724 --> 50:34.793
Hey, El.

50:34.827 --> 50:36.034
- Oh, hey, Ari. How are you?
- Hey, looking good.

50:36.068 --> 50:37.344
Don't wanna get
chicken all over you.

50:37.379 --> 50:39.517
Nice to see you.
Who's this little guy?

50:39.551 --> 50:41.931
Look how cute he is.
He's eating chicken soup.

50:41.965 --> 50:42.758
Hey, buddy.

50:42.793 --> 50:43.793
Who's
he look like, El?

50:43.827 --> 50:45.965
He looks just like his,
uh, grandpa.

50:48.724 --> 50:51.000
<i>I'm really excited
that my brother's bride
and Elliot</i>

50:51.034 --> 50:53.896
are gonna be meeting Avi
for the first time.

50:53.931 --> 50:56.655
Look, it's Uncle B.
He's huge. Oh, my God,
he's so heavy.

50:56.689 --> 50:58.551
He's not
a newborn, Brad.
- He's like 24 pounds.

50:58.586 --> 51:01.000
It's the first time
you see him, right?

51:01.034 --> 51:03.206
It's really great to be
surrounded by my family again.

51:03.241 --> 51:04.551
Yeah!

51:04.586 --> 51:06.862
<i>Being around people
that I know do care about me</i>

51:06.896 --> 51:08.137
<i>and want the best for me.</i>

51:08.172 --> 51:11.689
<i>Because when I'm in Ethiopia,
I can't say the same.</i>

51:13.551 --> 51:14.655
How does it feel
to be here?

51:15.413 --> 51:16.620
Feeling good.

51:16.655 --> 51:18.655
And all the noise
and craziness,

51:18.689 --> 51:20.000
did you miss it?

51:20.034 --> 51:21.103
I did.

51:21.137 --> 51:23.655
You know what? I ought to be
honest with you, I...

51:23.689 --> 51:25.620
I can't stand
not having you guys here.

51:25.655 --> 51:27.137
It makes me crazy.

51:27.172 --> 51:31.379
My goal, I mean,
I'm not gonna lie, is to see
if I can convince you guys

51:31.413 --> 51:33.172
to come and be near us.

51:39.689 --> 51:42.793
In all honesty,
I really would like Ari

51:42.827 --> 51:44.827
to live here
in Princeton with us.

51:44.862 --> 51:47.275
<i>Every mother would like
to have your daughter</i>

51:47.310 --> 51:49.413
<i>and your grandchildren
here with you.</i>

51:49.448 --> 51:53.517
I also feel that
Biniyam might be able
to communicate better with her

51:53.551 --> 51:56.724
if he understood what her life
is like here in Princeton.

51:56.758 --> 51:59.241
Uh, I mean, you know,
I'm gonna go back to Ethiopia.

51:59.275 --> 52:00.724
You know, I promised him
I would go back,

52:00.758 --> 52:02.896
so I'm not gonna
go back on my word.

52:02.931 --> 52:05.551
Oh, absolutely,
but, like, long term,

52:05.586 --> 52:07.068
do you plan to live there?

52:08.241 --> 52:10.206
Yeah, I mean,
I like our life in Ethiopia.

52:10.241 --> 52:12.068
It's, you know,
something I set my mind to,

52:12.103 --> 52:13.551
and we've been doing it.

52:13.586 --> 52:16.827
I've been trying to learn
Amharic and the culture,
you know?

52:16.862 --> 52:19.344
So, you know,
that's our plan to stay there.

52:23.034 --> 52:24.620
I'm just gonna
be honest with you,

52:24.655 --> 52:27.620
I think that now that
he's gonna be a year old

52:27.655 --> 52:29.379
before you know it,

52:29.413 --> 52:33.724
I think you need to consider
where you're gonna raise him

52:33.758 --> 52:35.827
and what kind of
school systems

52:35.862 --> 52:37.758
you want him to be in,

52:37.793 --> 52:40.965
and I think that
the best opportunities

52:41.000 --> 52:43.034
he could have
are here in the United States.

52:46.103 --> 52:51.103
I never expected
that Ari would want to live
long term in Ethiopia.

52:51.137 --> 52:55.172
<i>I'm just concerned
because I think now
it's all fun and games,</i>

52:55.206 --> 52:57.034
<i>he's still a baby,
he's still portable.</i>

52:57.620 --> 52:59.482
School seems so far off,

52:59.517 --> 53:01.655
but she's gonna
wake up to that fact.

53:01.689 --> 53:04.344
<i>You have to raise a person,
a human being.</i>

53:04.379 --> 53:06.172
Where do you want
that to take place

53:06.206 --> 53:08.172
and what do you want
for his life?

53:09.758 --> 53:11.931
So, I mean, do you... have you
talked to Biniyam about this?

53:11.965 --> 53:14.482
I mean, in the United States,
Biniyam's gonna have,

53:14.517 --> 53:18.344
you know, an easier time
finding employment.

53:18.379 --> 53:20.172
You know, you guys can
build a life here.

53:20.206 --> 53:21.758
Honestly,
it's not even an option.

53:21.793 --> 53:23.620
Even if we wanted
to come here, you know?

53:23.655 --> 53:27.896
About seven months ago,
I applied for the K1 Visa
for Bini.

53:29.655 --> 53:33.689
Since Corona happened,
the embassy's closed,

53:33.724 --> 53:37.137
so I don't even know
if they're still working
on the Visas at this point.

53:38.344 --> 53:40.413
Uh, at the time I wasn't
necessarily planning

53:40.448 --> 53:42.379
on using it to live
in the U.S.,

53:42.413 --> 53:47.172
because for one thing,
Bini never liked the idea
of leaving Ethiopia.

53:47.206 --> 53:50.103
But my mom encouraged us
to apply as soon as possible.

53:50.137 --> 53:52.034
She told me these
things do take time,

53:52.068 --> 53:54.000
you never know what could
happen in the future.

53:54.034 --> 53:56.551
So you haven't heard anything
back from that process?

53:56.586 --> 53:58.103
Just that
they cashed the check.

53:58.137 --> 53:59.620
Right.

53:59.655 --> 54:02.344
When I applied for it,
I wasn't sure that we wanted
to move here,

54:02.379 --> 54:04.517
but I at least wanted
to have the option, you know?

54:04.551 --> 54:06.586
At least, we could decide that
we wanted to stay in Ethiopia

54:06.620 --> 54:08.137
or do we wanna
go to the States.

54:08.172 --> 54:09.965
So it's my burning
question again, Ar.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.586
If you could get the Visa
tomorrow, would you come here?

54:12.620 --> 54:15.724
I mean, as much as...
as much as I love,
you know, being back,

54:15.758 --> 54:18.310
I don't have a house here,
I don't have a job here.

54:18.344 --> 54:20.931
And, you know, coming back
here feels like visiting.

54:20.965 --> 54:24.034
Listen, I love you,
but you need to wake up.

54:24.068 --> 54:27.137
Like, you did
your little thing,

54:27.172 --> 54:28.413
you had the baby
in Ethiopia...

54:28.448 --> 54:30.000
You should be
really proud of yourself.

54:30.034 --> 54:31.586
...now you gotta get
real about life.

54:32.965 --> 54:34.551
We wanna see him grow up.

54:35.655 --> 54:38.241
- Safely!
And with good education.

54:38.965 --> 54:40.000
- Yes!
- Yes!

54:40.517 --> 54:41.344
- To U.S.!
- U.S.A.!

54:42.551 --> 54:45.655
I wanna see you grow up, Avi!
We wanna see you grow up.

54:48.931 --> 54:51.965
I do wonder what it would
be like to live in the U.S.
with Bini

54:52.000 --> 54:53.793
and my family made
a lot of good points.

54:55.206 --> 54:57.482
<i>But I know Bini doesn't
wanna leave Ethiopia,</i>

54:57.517 --> 55:00.068
<i>so I'm not sure
that if we got the Visa</i>

55:00.103 --> 55:02.724
<i>that Bini would be willing
to make the same
sacrifices for me</i>

55:02.758 --> 55:03.758
<i>that I've made for him.</i>

55:10.068 --> 55:11.620
They're for you.

55:11.655 --> 55:14.344
Evelin wants me to leave,
but I told her

55:14.379 --> 55:16.034
I'm gonna fight
for our relationship

55:16.068 --> 55:18.482
until the day that
I'm basically forced
out of there.

55:24.965 --> 55:27.379
Sumit and I recently
invited his parents to come

55:27.413 --> 55:31.172
and stay with us for just
a trial move-in situation.

56:12.413 --> 56:14.206
<i>It's been several days
since I told Evelin</i>

56:14.241 --> 56:16.379
the full truth about Jenny.

56:16.413 --> 56:18.241
<i>She's letting me stay
in the extra room,</i>

56:18.275 --> 56:19.413
but we haven't really talked.

56:21.103 --> 56:24.379
<i>I don't wanna give up
on my relationship
with Evelin.</i>

56:24.413 --> 56:27.793
So, I'm just hoping that
things can work itself out.

56:33.344 --> 56:34.551
It's been weird.

56:34.586 --> 56:37.310
She hasn't really been wanting
to talk with me.

56:37.344 --> 56:39.793
She wants me to move out.
I don't wanna move out.

56:41.379 --> 56:42.931
Evelin wants me to leave,
but...

56:44.379 --> 56:47.103
<i>I told her I'm gonna fight
for our relationship</i>

56:48.862 --> 56:53.586
until the day that
I'm basically forced
out of there.

56:56.206 --> 56:58.137
So I'm just... I don't know
what I'm writing right now,

56:58.172 --> 57:00.310
I'm just writing
what's in my head

57:00.344 --> 57:02.551
and I really just want
to prove to Evelin

57:02.586 --> 57:04.724
that I'm sorry
and I'm not gonna make any...

57:05.655 --> 57:07.000
I won't make
any more mistakes.

58:52.793 --> 58:53.896
They're for you.

59:03.551 --> 59:04.275
Yeah.

59:29.586 --> 59:31.620
I'm not gonna sign
the divorce papers, not yet.

59:33.344 --> 59:34.206
That's fine.

59:36.517 --> 59:37.655
Cause I'm not going
to accept that.

59:37.689 --> 59:39.034
I want you to give
me another chance.

59:41.137 --> 59:42.655
I don't wanna give up on this.

59:57.827 --> 59:59.482
I'm gonna stay with Raul
until you change your mind.

1:00:11.793 --> 1:00:13.758
I've been in
these situations before,

1:00:13.793 --> 1:00:15.862
and we've, we've worked,
you know, back into things,

1:00:15.896 --> 1:00:18.241
but this time
it's like a whole other level.

1:00:18.275 --> 1:00:22.000
Like, I feel like
she's never been this devoted

1:00:22.034 --> 1:00:24.862
to us separating
and it's really scary,
actually.

1:00:24.896 --> 1:00:27.620
But if Evelin serves me
with divorce papers right now,

1:00:27.655 --> 1:00:28.724
I'll rip them up in her face.

1:00:53.517 --> 1:00:54.793
Okay. Umm.

1:00:54.827 --> 1:00:57.413
Do you think that
this is gonna be, like,
really expensive?

1:01:03.034 --> 1:01:06.103
Victor and I have been
in San Andres
for about a week.

1:01:06.137 --> 1:01:08.827
<i>We are going to Providencia
tomorrow morning</i>

1:01:08.862 --> 1:01:12.000
<i>and this time we're hoping
to start rebuilding.</i>

1:01:19.206 --> 1:01:21.448
<i>Financially,
this is gonna be a strain.</i>

1:01:21.482 --> 1:01:25.620
Like, it's nothing I'd really
planned for or budgeted for.

1:01:25.655 --> 1:01:28.172
<i>I had planned to go
to Providencia</i>

1:01:28.206 --> 1:01:29.827
<i>and live with Victor.</i>

1:01:29.862 --> 1:01:32.344
Now I'm renting a place
in San Andres

1:01:32.379 --> 1:01:35.344
<i>and I'm also paying
for the reconstruction
of the house.</i>

1:01:37.517 --> 1:01:40.137
It's funny cause
I don't think in
our hardware stores

1:01:40.172 --> 1:01:41.827
you can just buy a machete.

1:01:42.758 --> 1:01:43.551
No.

1:01:50.724 --> 1:01:53.758
Victor,
he doesn't have any money.

1:01:53.793 --> 1:01:57.241
You know, he's been
like living in COVID
and now this hurricane.

1:01:57.275 --> 1:02:00.793
<i>So it's putting a lot
of pressure on me.</i>

1:02:02.310 --> 1:02:03.379
Uh...

1:02:06.241 --> 1:02:09.448
558. 558.

1:02:10.793 --> 1:02:13.793
Oh, my God.
That's really expensive.

1:02:15.413 --> 1:02:18.551
I can get a drill
in the U.S. for like $50.

1:02:19.482 --> 1:02:20.655
Yeah.

1:02:20.689 --> 1:02:23.344
I don't think
that Victor, like,

1:02:23.379 --> 1:02:26.241
necessarily sees
the value of money sometimes.

1:02:26.275 --> 1:02:28.034
I think he thinks
I'm American,

1:02:28.068 --> 1:02:30.310
and I just have
like mad money.

1:02:30.344 --> 1:02:33.517
And when something cost
like almost twice as much

1:02:33.551 --> 1:02:35.000
as what I'd normally spend,

1:02:35.034 --> 1:02:38.000
it's really hard to justify
spending that money.

1:02:40.482 --> 1:02:43.172
Could you ask him
about the drill or...

1:02:43.206 --> 1:02:45.551
They'll just see if
there's like another

1:02:45.586 --> 1:02:46.896
or like a cheaper drill.

1:03:15.275 --> 1:03:18.586
No, we don't. Because those
things charge for a while.

1:03:20.241 --> 1:03:21.413
Why?

1:03:22.793 --> 1:03:25.551
Yeah, I understand.
I understand how that works.

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.827
My drill lasts for,
like, weeks.

1:03:38.896 --> 1:03:40.241
Yeah, weeks.

1:03:48.517 --> 1:03:49.827
How much is
that battery?

1:04:05.241 --> 1:04:07.793
You know, with the drill
plus the backup battery,

1:04:07.827 --> 1:04:09.896
that's a good amount of time.

1:04:09.931 --> 1:04:12.103
That just seems like
it would be too excessive

1:04:12.137 --> 1:04:14.482
to buy a really
expensive generator.

1:04:15.689 --> 1:04:17.310
Whatever, you're the one
doing the work,

1:04:17.344 --> 1:04:18.586
so you do whatever you want.

1:04:20.896 --> 1:04:23.551
<i>I wish he would understand
more where I'm coming from</i>

1:04:23.586 --> 1:04:25.793
<i>when I'm trying
to budget and, you know,</i>

1:04:25.827 --> 1:04:28.172
<i>make the smart choices
about money.</i>

1:04:29.482 --> 1:04:33.034
<i>I don't mind being, like,
the bigger breadwinner</i>

1:04:33.068 --> 1:04:34.344
<i>in our relationship,</i>

1:04:34.379 --> 1:04:37.103
<i>because I definitely have
more means than he does,</i>

1:04:37.137 --> 1:04:41.827
but I think sometimes he's not
that appreciative of it

1:04:41.862 --> 1:04:43.344
and that bothers me.

1:04:48.793 --> 1:04:50.724
$230, basically.

1:04:56.655 --> 1:04:59.103
If my family knew
we were having a baby,

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:01.379
they'd have
better feelings than

1:05:01.413 --> 1:05:04.000
if we said we're gonna
adopt a child with HIV.

1:05:04.034 --> 1:05:05.896
There'd be so much
judgment around it.

1:05:06.793 --> 1:05:08.793
This is like,
with you being gay,

1:05:08.827 --> 1:05:10.344
you being in a relationship
with a man,

1:05:10.379 --> 1:05:11.724
that's their problem.

1:05:39.413 --> 1:05:40.724
Merry-go-round.

1:05:40.758 --> 1:05:43.517
I haven't seen one of these
since I was a little kid.

1:05:43.551 --> 1:05:46.896
I get dizzy really quick.
I'll spin you guys.

1:05:48.241 --> 1:05:49.275
Wait.

1:05:51.862 --> 1:05:53.310
I'm dizzy just looking at it.

1:05:54.413 --> 1:05:55.448
Jump on for a second.

1:05:57.241 --> 1:05:58.206
Oh, God.

1:06:04.344 --> 1:06:06.206
Recently, Armando and I
have been talking about

1:06:06.241 --> 1:06:09.310
growing our family and we're
weighing out our options.

1:06:09.344 --> 1:06:11.206
- Do you feel sick?
- Oh, yes. I do.

1:06:13.655 --> 1:06:17.482
A few days ago,
we visited an orphanage
with HIV-positive children.

1:06:17.517 --> 1:06:19.586
<i>And it really let me open
to the possibility</i>

1:06:19.620 --> 1:06:21.172
<i>of adopting a child like this.</i>

1:06:28.068 --> 1:06:29.827
Woah.

1:06:29.862 --> 1:06:33.965
But Armando also brought up
that he would want a baby
through in vitro.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:35.931
So, at this point,
I think Armando and I

1:06:35.965 --> 1:06:38.000
need to talk this out
and see where we both stand.

1:06:39.413 --> 1:06:40.379
I got dizzy.

1:06:40.758 --> 1:06:41.448
I know.

1:06:45.862 --> 1:06:48.965
Let's have a seat
'cause I'm too dizzy.

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.965
- You dizzy?
- From the spinning.

1:06:52.103 --> 1:06:53.862
I told you I'd make
the world spin for you.

1:06:55.241 --> 1:06:56.275
It wasn't you
this time.

1:06:58.482 --> 1:07:02.068
You think you can handle
more than one at a time?

1:07:02.103 --> 1:07:03.413
I think I can.

1:07:06.206 --> 1:07:10.448
I am, like, in a debate
in my head of what
necessarily to do.

1:07:10.482 --> 1:07:15.655
What I'm leaning towards
right now is adoption.

1:07:15.689 --> 1:07:17.827
I would like to start
that process

1:07:17.862 --> 1:07:20.758
and then we can visit
surrogacy

1:07:20.793 --> 1:07:22.172
or something like that,
down the line.

1:07:22.206 --> 1:07:25.344
You wanna start surrogacy down
the line, but when is that?

1:07:25.896 --> 1:07:27.413
I don't know.

1:07:27.448 --> 1:07:29.517
I am more leaning
to having a baby

1:07:29.551 --> 1:07:31.068
because the idea is wonderful.

1:07:31.103 --> 1:07:33.827
Because having Kenny's
bloodline in our family,

1:07:33.862 --> 1:07:38.241
like, that would really unify
and bring our family
closer together.

1:07:38.275 --> 1:07:42.482
Um, and also the fact of,
I do think of the battle
within myself,

1:07:42.517 --> 1:07:45.068
within my family,
within the government

1:07:45.103 --> 1:07:47.517
and everything we would have
to go through to adopt,

1:07:47.551 --> 1:07:49.310
<i>because it is
a very long process,</i>

1:07:49.344 --> 1:07:50.724
and it just might never happen

1:07:50.758 --> 1:07:53.896
and not work for us
five years down the line.

1:07:53.931 --> 1:07:57.448
I think if my family knew
we were having a baby,

1:07:57.482 --> 1:07:58.620
they'd have better feelings

1:07:58.655 --> 1:08:00.241
than if we said we're gonna
adopt this...

1:08:00.275 --> 1:08:01.827
a child with HIV.

1:08:03.241 --> 1:08:05.241
There'd be so much
judgement around it.

1:08:06.344 --> 1:08:08.931
I wouldn't choose
to have a child,

1:08:08.965 --> 1:08:12.758
a baby based on families
or outside influence.

1:08:12.793 --> 1:08:15.206
I would base it on
what we want,
not what they want.

1:08:15.241 --> 1:08:18.275
It's not based on them,
you're not understanding me.

1:08:18.310 --> 1:08:23.068
I wanna have a baby that has
your blood and I love that,

1:08:23.103 --> 1:08:25.103
but then thinking as a whole

1:08:25.137 --> 1:08:27.586
it'd be easier for me

1:08:27.620 --> 1:08:29.862
to not have to explain myself
left and right.

1:08:31.206 --> 1:08:33.448
It's like, with you being gay,

1:08:33.482 --> 1:08:35.034
you being in a relationship
with a man.

1:08:35.068 --> 1:08:36.241
That's their problem.

1:08:37.724 --> 1:08:41.034
I know Armando would
have a difficult time
and a struggle

1:08:41.068 --> 1:08:45.655
<i>talking to his family
if we were to adopt
an HIV child.</i>

1:08:45.689 --> 1:08:49.000
You know, he just went through
years of battling with them,

1:08:49.034 --> 1:08:51.965
with coming out and them
trying to deal with it.

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.103
<i>And I wouldn't want it
to put a strain on it</i>

1:08:54.137 --> 1:08:56.931
where they would have a break
in their relationship,

1:08:56.965 --> 1:08:59.172
'cause I would
never want that.

1:08:59.206 --> 1:09:02.758
Like, if my daughter says,
"Oh, no, I wouldn't want you
to have...

1:09:02.793 --> 1:09:06.034
adopt an HIV baby
'cause I wouldn't want him
around my kid"

1:09:06.068 --> 1:09:07.137
or something like that,

1:09:07.172 --> 1:09:08.586
that would
be her problem, then.

1:09:08.620 --> 1:09:11.068
Okay, then let's not
think about my family.

1:09:11.103 --> 1:09:13.689
Why is... why are you more
focused on adopting now?

1:09:15.034 --> 1:09:18.275
I would rather help a kid
than make a kid.

1:09:19.758 --> 1:09:22.172
Well, and I feel
your feelings too.

1:09:22.206 --> 1:09:25.000
I felt the same way
going to the orphanage

1:09:25.034 --> 1:09:26.931
and the intention to help.

1:09:26.965 --> 1:09:29.689
But also, I mean,
being honest,

1:09:31.068 --> 1:09:32.827
your age got me thinking, too.

1:09:32.862 --> 1:09:36.034
Like, why are
we putting ourselves
in this hard position,

1:09:36.068 --> 1:09:38.517
this long road ahead of us
that will be hard.

1:09:45.655 --> 1:09:47.137
But, so, like,
if I told you...

1:09:48.482 --> 1:09:51.172
I just wanna have a baby,
you don't want that?

1:09:51.206 --> 1:09:53.586
No, I... no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

1:09:53.620 --> 1:09:55.310
I can see it happening

1:09:55.344 --> 1:09:56.793
and obviously
I also understand

1:09:56.827 --> 1:10:00.551
that waiting for an adoption
is a long road.

1:10:00.586 --> 1:10:01.758
I understand that.

1:10:03.931 --> 1:10:06.758
I know adoption seems like
it would take a lot longer.

1:10:07.655 --> 1:10:10.517
Um... and unfortunately,

1:10:10.551 --> 1:10:12.068
that's where I do have
to look at my age

1:10:12.103 --> 1:10:15.206
because I am... um...

1:10:16.172 --> 1:10:18.103
I am the age what I am and...

1:10:18.896 --> 1:10:19.862
um...

1:10:23.965 --> 1:10:25.275
It's something
to really think about.

1:10:26.827 --> 1:10:28.862
I say we just focus
on this wedding

1:10:28.896 --> 1:10:30.655
'cause this is, like,
stressful enough.

1:10:31.551 --> 1:10:33.344
- Yeah.
- And then, after that,

1:10:33.379 --> 1:10:37.068
we just look into both and see
what both have to offer.

1:11:44.137 --> 1:11:47.275
She wants me
to go back to Russia

1:11:47.310 --> 1:11:50.413
and I still have no idea
what to do.

1:16:01.689 --> 1:16:03.103
This is where all
the cooking happens.

1:16:07.034 --> 1:16:09.758
She's going through
my kitchen and finding
every single thing wrong,

1:16:09.793 --> 1:16:11.517
<i>making me clean and sweep.</i>

1:17:32.655 --> 1:17:33.482
Hi.

1:17:42.137 --> 1:17:44.275
Oh, yes. I can't wait.

1:17:46.206 --> 1:17:49.586
Sumit and I recently invited
his parents to come and

1:17:49.620 --> 1:17:52.655
<i>stay with us for just
a trial move-in situation.</i>

1:17:52.689 --> 1:17:55.068
<i>So Sumit's mom
can start training me</i>

1:17:55.103 --> 1:17:59.517
how to be a traditional
"Indian daughter-in-law."

1:17:59.551 --> 1:18:03.620
<i>And Sumit is very hopeful
that their intensions
are good,</i>

1:18:03.655 --> 1:18:09.034
and they'll finally accept me
as his future wife.

1:18:09.068 --> 1:18:13.482
But I'm feeling very
nervous and scared.

1:18:22.620 --> 1:18:23.275
Mmm-hmm.

1:18:28.655 --> 1:18:30.448
I'm gonna try my best.

1:18:30.482 --> 1:18:33.413
I'm not gonna be perfect
and I'm gonna do things wrong.

1:18:33.448 --> 1:18:36.586
What I need from you
is just please have my back.

1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:39.000
Like, like...
defend me if they...

1:18:39.034 --> 1:18:40.758
if they start coming at me.

1:18:40.793 --> 1:18:43.241
Have my back, don't...
don't throw me under the bus.

1:19:41.482 --> 1:19:43.275
We'd like
to invite you in.

1:19:43.896 --> 1:19:45.413
Hi, beautiful Sadhna.

1:19:45.862 --> 1:19:47.000
Thank you.

1:20:03.517 --> 1:20:06.448
It's a happy moment for us
for you guys to be here.

1:20:12.586 --> 1:20:15.379
This shows all
of our marks of our drinks.

1:20:28.103 --> 1:20:31.482
Right away she's pointing
at the rings on
the coffee table,

1:20:31.517 --> 1:20:33.517
<i>like, this is how
it's all gonna be.</i>

1:20:36.344 --> 1:20:38.896
She wanna do
tour of the house.

1:20:38.931 --> 1:20:39.586
Okay.

1:20:45.034 --> 1:20:46.931
This is where
all the cooking happens.

1:20:47.586 --> 1:20:48.620
Hmm.

1:21:05.068 --> 1:21:06.034
Okay.

1:21:12.551 --> 1:21:13.931
Put everything away.

1:21:13.965 --> 1:21:16.172
After you clean,
then you...
I put them up here.

1:21:16.206 --> 1:21:17.103
Okay.

1:21:33.206 --> 1:21:34.586
I don't know
where the broom is.

1:21:40.827 --> 1:21:42.413
She's going through my kitchen

1:21:42.448 --> 1:21:45.000
and finding every single thing
wrong, checking every corner,

1:21:45.034 --> 1:21:48.034
moving my stuff around,
making me clean and sweep.

1:21:48.551 --> 1:21:49.379
Okay?

1:21:54.034 --> 1:21:55.517
Well, God damn, man.

1:21:55.551 --> 1:21:58.586
If this isn't going the way
exactly I knew it would.

1:21:58.620 --> 1:21:59.724
I'm just pissed.

1:21:59.758 --> 1:22:01.275
She's... She's just...
It's my kitchen.

1:22:10.758 --> 1:22:11.896
Oh, flies?

1:22:46.448 --> 1:22:47.379
Jenny...

1:22:47.413 --> 1:22:48.310
What?

1:22:48.344 --> 1:22:51.413
She's saying don't,
don't feel mad.

1:22:51.448 --> 1:22:52.344
This is...

1:22:52.379 --> 1:22:53.482
No, I'm, it's...

1:23:06.206 --> 1:23:08.551
<i>Sumit's mom is just
starting to make me feel bad,</i>

1:23:08.586 --> 1:23:09.689
<i>she's trying
to make me look bad</i>

1:23:09.724 --> 1:23:11.689
and she's just trying
to find reasons

1:23:11.724 --> 1:23:14.827
to say "Jenny is not
good enough for my son."

1:23:19.517 --> 1:23:22.034
I just feel like
this is gonna ruin
our relationship

1:23:22.068 --> 1:23:24.586
and I wish that
they would leave now.

1:23:28.965 --> 1:23:33.000
<i>Next time on
The Other Way...</i>

1:23:33.034 --> 1:23:37.241
I'm excited that Evelin has
agreed to do couple's therapy.

1:23:37.275 --> 1:23:40.586
You are here
because you want
the relationship to work,

1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:41.620
- correct?
- Yeah.

1:23:43.379 --> 1:23:44.344
What is that?

1:23:53.413 --> 1:23:56.620
Since I left, you do whatever
the hell you feel like.

1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:05.241
<i>I've been so hurt
by Bini's behavior
since I've been in America.</i>

1:24:05.275 --> 1:24:08.000
I call you and you turn
your phone off
for three hours.

1:24:11.551 --> 1:24:12.448
I can try.

1:24:13.413 --> 1:24:15.172
<i>I'm nervous at every moment</i>

1:24:15.206 --> 1:24:17.517
that I'm around
Sumit's mother.

1:24:19.551 --> 1:24:22.931
But the vibe that I'm getting
is actually very positive.

1:24:22.965 --> 1:24:25.137
I even am seeing her smile.

1:24:28.793 --> 1:24:31.551
I think that we could
actually be friends.

1:24:40.862 --> 1:24:42.034
You tried setting me up?

1:24:47.655 --> 1:24:50.862
<i>How do you feel becoming
a new grandpa again?</i>

1:24:50.896 --> 1:24:54.137
I want nothing more than to be
with you through this.

1:24:54.172 --> 1:24:56.689
I'm gonna be honest
with you...

1:24:57.689 --> 1:25:00.862
I am really homesick.

1:25:02.724 --> 1:25:06.172
I hope this isn't something
where you'd wanna go back home

1:25:06.206 --> 1:25:07.689
and cancel the wedding
or something.

1:25:12.172 --> 1:25:13.137
You're scaring me.
