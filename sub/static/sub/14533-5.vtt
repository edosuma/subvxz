00:13.875 --> 00:14.917
-to Philadelphia.
-(CROWD GASPING)

00:15.125 --> 00:16.583
We take the bitch down and the
best man wins.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.875
LEE RUSSELL:
This is a temporary alliance.

00:17.875 --> 00:20.000
I still think you're
a fuckin' dipshit.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.750
We're doing serious business,

00:24.291 --> 00:26.667
but it don't mean
it can't be fun, too.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.583
NEAL GAMBY: This is not what
I signed up for.

00:28.583 --> 00:29.917
Why would they single me out?

00:29.917 --> 00:31.667
I bet they think you're
a weak person.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.583
Are you pumped for the big
game tomorrow night?

00:33.583 --> 00:36.041
-We are going to kick some ass!
-(CROWD CHEERING)

00:36.041 --> 00:37.583
RUSSELL: If we win
this game,

00:37.583 --> 00:40.166
everything that we worked for
will be for nothing!

00:40.542 --> 00:42.583
We'll take down Belinda Brown,
but not at the expense

00:42.583 --> 00:43.542
of North Jackson.

00:44.625 --> 00:45.917
RUSSELL:
We've made her a martyr.

I live to fight ♪

01:02.625 --> 01:04.208

Dude, turn it up!

01:07.291 --> 01:08.917
Lee.

01:10.708 --> 01:12.625
Lee!
What? I'm sleeping.

01:12.625 --> 01:14.625
Jackie's working out again.

01:14.625 --> 01:16.458
Well, put in
the earplugs I got you.

01:16.458 --> 01:19.583
I did.
They keep falling out.

01:19.583 --> 01:21.417
Please, Lee?
It's so loud.

01:21.417 --> 01:23.291
Can you go over there?

01:23.291 --> 01:26.333
I was just having
the most incredible dream.

01:26.333 --> 01:27.500
I can't believe this.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.041
You can't fucking
put in fucking earplugs.
Whoo!

01:30.041 --> 01:32.417
Fuck yes!

01:32.417 --> 01:33.667
Fuck yeah!

01:34.875 --> 01:37.792
Fuck yeah!

01:37.792 --> 01:40.166
(grunts)

01:41.250 --> 01:42.458
Hey, Jackie!

01:44.000 --> 01:46.083
Uh, fellas?

01:46.083 --> 01:47.333
Jackie:
What's up, Lee?

01:47.333 --> 01:49.750
How's the, uh,
the workout going?

01:49.750 --> 01:51.333
Ah, it's leg day.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.708
Not my favorite thing to do,

01:52.708 --> 01:53.792
but still gotta
do it, right?

01:53.792 --> 01:55.291
Oh, absolutely.
You have to do it, right?

01:55.291 --> 01:57.208
(chuckles)
So hey, uh...
What's happening?

01:57.208 --> 01:59.792
I-- I think maybe
we've talked about this,

01:59.792 --> 02:01.166
but, um, uh, when--

02:01.166 --> 02:02.834
when you boys are out here
doing your thing,

02:02.834 --> 02:05.166
do you mind keeping
the garage doors closed?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.750
My wife,
she gets all weird

02:06.750 --> 02:08.333
about getting
eight hours of sleep.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.875
Me, I can snore
through anything.

02:09.875 --> 02:11.250
To tell you
the truth, I...

02:11.250 --> 02:12.875
I kinda gotta leave it
open, man.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.542
Keeps the air fresh
in here, you know?

02:14.542 --> 02:16.333
Oh, I bet it gets
real ripe in there,

02:16.333 --> 02:18.708
all y'all big boys
just sweatin' everywhere.

02:18.708 --> 02:19.708
(chuckles)
But, uh...

02:19.708 --> 02:21.708
well, maybe y'all can
take it inside then.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.708
Enjoy the air-conditioning.
Lee...

02:23.708 --> 02:25.375
I think I can do
what I want

02:25.375 --> 02:26.917
in my own garage,
can't I? (chuckles)

02:26.917 --> 02:29.083
Well, of course, Jackie.
I'm-- I'm not saying it's--

02:29.083 --> 02:30.959
Okay, if you want to
get technical right now,

02:30.959 --> 02:32.708
you're trespassing.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.000
(laughs)
I'm fucking
with you, man.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.500
Man, chill.
You were scared,
you were scared.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.333
I was just--
I didn't get scared.
Yes, you were.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.542
Yes. Yes, you were.
Come here!
No, I wasn't scared. Aah!

02:41.542 --> 02:43.083
That's a little bitch.
Yeah, boy!

02:43.083 --> 02:45.208
We got a live one
here tonight, boys!
Please, please, guys.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.875
(yelling in Korean)
I can't breathe!

02:46.875 --> 02:48.542
Jackie. Please, Jackie,
I can't breathe.

02:48.542 --> 02:50.250
Whoa! Damn!
I can't breathe!

02:50.250 --> 02:51.625
You just tried
to touch my dick!

02:51.625 --> 02:52.708
No, I didn't!
Yes, you did.

02:52.708 --> 02:54.250
No.
You tried to jerk me off.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.208
Why would I try
to touch your dick, Jackie?
I've got my own dick.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.458
I didn't try to touch your--
Whatever you say, princess.

02:58.458 --> 02:59.834
(Mi-Cha continues yelling)
Hey, Chinks!

02:59.834 --> 03:01.417
How you doin' over there?
(yells)

03:01.417 --> 03:02.792
Okay, you've been here
too long.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.542
(mocking accent)
You go now.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.875
You go now.
Prease, go.

03:06.875 --> 03:08.083
Night-night.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.208
(music plays louder)

03:10.208 --> 03:11.500
Jackie:
Yeah, boy!

03:11.500 --> 03:14.000
Welcome to hell, Lee!

03:14.000 --> 03:16.250
Fuck yeah!

03:16.250 --> 03:17.917
(theme music playing)

03:28.250 --> 03:30.125
Gamby:
Let's keep the line
moving, guys. Come on.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.500
Get your macaroni
and cheeses.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.750
Get your cutlery
and let's keep
the line flowing.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.000
Good work.

03:38.959 --> 03:40.375
Dayshawn:
What's up, Mr. Gamby?

03:40.375 --> 03:42.417
What'd you get up to
this weekend?

03:45.041 --> 03:47.625
Hey, it was nice talking
to you, Mr. Gamby.

03:47.625 --> 03:48.959
Miss Snodgrass.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.041
Oh, hey.
You should grab a tray
and follow me.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.625
We're gonna skip the line.
Oh, okay.

03:52.625 --> 03:54.458
Yeah. There's gonna
be a fire drill.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.125
Oh.
Yeah.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.458
We're not supposed
to say it's a drill,
but it is a drill.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.083
I just didn't want
you to be scared is all.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.708
Oh. Thanks, uh,
for looking out for me.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.083
Oh, I know you'd do
the same for me.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.458
Hold the line, everyone.
It's a faculty member.

04:06.458 --> 04:07.917
Back up, back up.

04:07.917 --> 04:10.458
Dayshawn, I think she'd like
a warm, hot meal.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.208
Okay.
Uh, thanks, Dayshawn. Yeah.

04:14.208 --> 04:15.792
Sure.
You got it.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.333
(fire alarm rings)

04:20.333 --> 04:22.291
Gamby:
Use all doors,
all doors.

04:22.291 --> 04:25.000
Keep moving.
The school is on fire!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.792
Slow children burn,
smart kids learn!

04:27.792 --> 04:28.792
Find your class,

04:28.792 --> 04:31.208
find your teacher,
get your ass in line!

04:31.208 --> 04:32.542
Move, move, move!

04:32.542 --> 04:34.250
Gamby: Come on, you guys!
Like your life
depended on it!

04:34.250 --> 04:35.834
Come on, guys!
Why'd you bring
your book bag?

04:35.834 --> 04:36.959
You're not leaving school. Go!

04:36.959 --> 04:38.000
Get in line, goddamn it.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.625
Zip the lips!
Straighten the lines
right now!

04:40.625 --> 04:41.708
In a real fire,

04:41.708 --> 04:44.000
or if a terrorist organization
had infiltrated us,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.458
we need to be able
to identify who's missing,

04:46.458 --> 04:49.375
who's possibly burnt,
and dead inside the school.

04:49.375 --> 04:52.083
All right.
12 minutes, 46 seconds.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.834
I know that seems
like a long time,

04:53.834 --> 04:55.917
but it's actually pretty good
for November.
You know what?

04:55.917 --> 04:58.834
I'm very impressed
with the organization,
but we should still be--

04:58.834 --> 05:00.583
Hold up for a second.
Demetrius Todd!

05:00.583 --> 05:03.375
Demetrius!
Phone down now.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.291
If this were an emergency,
how do you expect to hear

05:05.291 --> 05:07.041
what I'm saying
if you're yip-yapping
on the phone?

05:07.041 --> 05:09.375
My mom's calling.
I don't care

05:09.375 --> 05:10.625
if it's the queen of England.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.542
All right?
Put the phone down right now.

05:12.542 --> 05:15.208
Don't you snarl at me.
I will smash that phone.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.875
One week detention
for that phone,

05:16.875 --> 05:19.542
one week's detention
for snarling at me.

05:20.792 --> 05:21.708
Fix the face.

05:21.708 --> 05:25.000
Fix the face right now.
Do you hear me?

05:27.375 --> 05:28.750
Marcus Byrd,
what's so funny?

05:28.750 --> 05:29.917
Buy a belt
and pull your pants up.

05:29.917 --> 05:32.250
You look like
a flippin' circus clown!

05:34.959 --> 05:36.291
Yeah.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.542
Mr. Gamby,
how many students

05:40.542 --> 05:42.792
would you say
you suspended last year?

05:42.792 --> 05:44.417
In school or all the way?

05:44.417 --> 05:45.750
51 students.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.166
See, you didn't let me guess.
I was gonna probably say 45.

05:48.166 --> 05:50.875
183 detentions...

05:50.875 --> 05:52.750
and four expulsions?

05:52.750 --> 05:56.291
These numbers are pretty high.
Well, yeah, that might be
a little higher than usual.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.208
We had a pretty mouthy
senior class last year.

05:58.208 --> 06:01.708
Do you feel that you
get positive results
with your method?

06:01.708 --> 06:03.375
I mean, do the kids
turn it around

06:03.375 --> 06:04.625
when they come back
from suspension?

06:04.625 --> 06:06.333
I mean, the smart ones
that have sense do.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.917
You know, then there's
some that just have

06:07.917 --> 06:09.917
darkness in their heart
and will never learn.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.625
Mr. Gamby, we're gonna try
something brand-new.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.250
Flip the script,
as it were.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.083
From now on,
zero suspensions,

06:17.083 --> 06:18.250
zero detentions,

06:18.250 --> 06:20.750
and for damn sure,
zero expulsions.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.875
(snorts) All right. Well,
that's pretty much all the tools

06:22.875 --> 06:24.375
that there are
to discipline people,

06:24.375 --> 06:26.834
so kids are gonna run wild.
Sounds like a great idea.

06:26.834 --> 06:31.208
We're gonna try a method
called restorative justice.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.959
Instead of trying
to punish bad behavior,

06:33.959 --> 06:35.458
we're gonna bring
the offenders together,

06:35.458 --> 06:39.250
give them a non-judgmental space
called The Circle Room.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.500
Miss Swift?
Yes?

06:40.500 --> 06:43.458
Can you look
into the price of--

06:43.458 --> 06:44.500
(loud thwack)

06:47.583 --> 06:49.250
Why don't you look
into the pricing

06:49.250 --> 06:50.708
for some beanbag chairs,
Okay.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.458
a boom box, and...

06:52.458 --> 06:54.000
Ooh! A popcorn machine!
Ooh!

06:54.000 --> 06:55.458
Swift: Okay!
I can't even tell

06:55.458 --> 06:56.750
if you're being
serious right now.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.542
Beanbags and a popcorn machine?

06:58.542 --> 07:00.333
Relax, Mr. Gamby.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.083
This is gonna be nice
for you, too.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.625
You won't have
to walk around here

07:03.625 --> 07:05.708
yelling at everybody.
(chortles)

07:05.708 --> 07:07.875
Don't laugh, Swift.
It's not funny.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.667
She can laugh at whatever
she wants to laugh at,
Mr. Gamby.

07:10.667 --> 07:11.750
Well, her face
is disrespectful--

07:11.750 --> 07:13.667
Put your eyebrows down
and calm down.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.500
Thank you.

07:18.583 --> 07:19.875
That's what I--
(loud snap)

07:21.000 --> 07:22.834
Are you threatening her?

07:22.834 --> 07:24.667
Nope. This pencil broke.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.333
Gamby:
This goddamn woman.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.000
How dare her try
to make me feel

07:28.000 --> 07:30.125
like I gotta be self-conscious
about my fucking record.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.667
I was looking at her
and I'm thinking,

07:31.667 --> 07:33.333
"You know what Lee Russell
would do right now?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.000
"I bet you money
Lee Russell would just haul back

07:35.000 --> 07:37.583
and just smack
the fuck out of her face."
And you know what?

07:37.583 --> 07:39.375
I almost did it.
Are you serious right now?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.500
I couldn't believe it either.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.208
Done with her shit.
You're complaining

07:43.208 --> 07:46.333
about Belinda Brown
being mean to you.

07:46.333 --> 07:50.166
(scoffs)
Yeah. I'm just so sick of it.

07:50.166 --> 07:53.208
Ow! Russell, what the--
You did this,
you fucking piece of shit!

07:53.208 --> 07:54.792
We had her dead to rights,

07:54.792 --> 07:56.708
on the fucking ropes,
and you just...

07:56.708 --> 07:57.917
pussied out!

07:57.917 --> 07:59.667
We should've taken her out
when we had the chance,

07:59.667 --> 08:03.875
and now we're worse off
than when we started, Gamby.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.208
Where's my fucking cigarette?

08:07.208 --> 08:10.208
Well, I think that that's
an unfair assessment
of the situation.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.708
If you ask me,
I, you know, it's...

08:11.708 --> 08:12.792
it's been mild success.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.000
You know, I have--

08:14.000 --> 08:17.208
I have a lot
of dark shit going on

08:17.208 --> 08:20.083
in my life right now, Gamby,
and I could really use a...

08:20.083 --> 08:22.166
And you don't even
fucking care!

08:22.166 --> 08:23.583
Yes, I do, Russell.

08:23.583 --> 08:24.875
We're partners.
No, we're not.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.083
We're not partners.
Fuck this partnership.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.250
I'm gonna get me
a new partner.

08:29.250 --> 08:32.375
Someone who will actually
help me get things done.

08:32.375 --> 08:35.083
Someone who's not
a fucking little pussy!

08:35.083 --> 08:36.667
A fucking little pussy?
A hairy,

08:36.667 --> 08:38.708
mustached pussy!
That's what you think I am?

08:38.708 --> 08:40.875
I burned her whole
goddamn house down.

08:40.875 --> 08:41.959
No, you didn't!

08:41.959 --> 08:43.708
I set that fire

08:43.708 --> 08:44.917
and you ran!

08:44.917 --> 08:46.417
You're just a--
a fat-ass,

08:46.417 --> 08:49.375
narcissistic,
selfish fucking
oaf is what you are

08:49.375 --> 08:51.917
with a stupid fucking haircut
and ears!
Stop! That's enough!

08:51.917 --> 08:54.458
Don't touch me!
Don't you just sit there
and insult me!

08:54.458 --> 08:56.542
I'm sick and tired of you
always railing on me.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.875
You know, there's shit about you
that I think is disgusting!

08:58.875 --> 09:00.166
Oh?
Your whiny voice.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.208
You're just like a little
hysterical bitch all the time!

09:02.208 --> 09:03.959
You know what?
You got such problems with me?

09:03.959 --> 09:05.417
Well, fuck you.
I'm done with you.

09:05.417 --> 09:06.458
Oh, it's done.
Yeah.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.750
Oh, it is done!
Well, it's done.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.959
It wasn't a fucking question.
It was rhetorical.

09:09.959 --> 09:11.458
I'm done with you up to here!

09:11.458 --> 09:13.750
Right up to here!
It's over!

09:13.750 --> 09:14.959
Fuck this!

09:14.959 --> 09:17.125
It's done!
Yeah, because I said it's done!

09:17.125 --> 09:18.542
I'm the one
who said it was done!

09:18.542 --> 09:20.083
I said it was done first.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.375
You just repeat everything
I say, you little fucking
mockingbird.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.208
Oh, okay, I'll say
something you haven't said.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.375
I hope you die, bitch!

09:25.375 --> 09:27.458
You're already dead.
You're already fucking dead.

09:27.458 --> 09:28.959
No, I'm not!
You're just saying that.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.667
I'm the one who's alive
'cause I'm standing here.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.291
You're dead
'cause you're walking away.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.708
Fuck you!
You're dead!

09:33.708 --> 09:35.959
I'll see you
in fucking hell someday!

09:36.792 --> 09:39.125
Keep walking, sassy-pants!

09:39.125 --> 09:40.250
(scoffs)

09:40.250 --> 09:42.125
Fine, Russell! Leave!

09:42.125 --> 09:43.667
You bitch!

09:43.667 --> 09:45.458
You dumb bitch!

09:48.166 --> 09:50.875
Russell, do you have
your-- your walkie on?
Come back.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.166
Russell, come back, man.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.041
Look, we can just--
Let's just talk about it
real quick.

09:56.041 --> 09:59.208
Maybe things got
out of hand there
for a second.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.500
(dramatic music plays
on television)

10:01.500 --> 10:04.333
(woman speaking Korean)

10:04.333 --> 10:06.834
(man singing in Korean)

10:07.959 --> 10:09.917
(Mi-Cha gasps)

10:09.917 --> 10:13.333
(metal music playing)

10:14.250 --> 10:15.291
It's Jackie again.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.208
When is it
my time, Christine?

10:17.208 --> 10:19.667
When do I just get to relax?

10:19.667 --> 10:21.875
(Mi-Cha speaking Korean)

10:21.875 --> 10:22.959
Please--

10:22.959 --> 10:25.166
Mi-Cha, Mi-Cha,
let other people talk.
Boom!

10:25.166 --> 10:26.667
Boom, boom,
boom, boom!

10:26.667 --> 10:28.917
Tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick!

10:28.917 --> 10:30.708
Boom, boom,
boom, boom!

10:30.708 --> 10:31.959
Tick, tick!
All right, I'm fed up.

10:31.959 --> 10:33.333
I'm fed up!
I warned him.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.875
You step to me,
this is what you get!

10:35.875 --> 10:38.083
Yes, this is Lee Russell,

10:38.083 --> 10:40.208
and I would like to report
a disturbance.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.542
No, not in my house.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.750
Next door.
(phone chatter)

10:47.083 --> 10:50.792
(police radio chatter)
(chuckles)

10:50.792 --> 10:53.375
Russell:
Who's got the muscles
now, dick-head?

10:53.375 --> 10:55.667
I do. That's who.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.375

11:27.625 --> 11:28.875
Oh!
(clattering)

11:29.875 --> 11:31.083
(exhales)

11:31.083 --> 11:32.417
(school bell chimes)

11:33.792 --> 11:35.250
Aaron Jeffries,
you better be glad

11:35.250 --> 11:36.667
that Travis Knight
is still alive.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.917
If you would have clipped him
in the right part of the temple,

11:38.917 --> 11:40.458
you know, that would have
been murder one.

11:40.458 --> 11:41.917
And you are being tried
as an adult.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.500
So now, this belongs to me.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.083
An infraction like this
would definitely make sure
you don't get into college.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.375
But I don't imagine
you're going to college anyway.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.750
You're a goddamn idiot
just like your brother was.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.625
It's the truth.
You and your brother are

11:54.625 --> 11:57.125
the two dumbest
bucktoothed cousin fuckers
I've ever met.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.667
Understand?

11:58.667 --> 11:59.750
Good.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.583
Circles is done.

12:01.583 --> 12:05.583
Okay, that's not exactly how
we're gonna do things here,
so let's back it up.

12:05.583 --> 12:09.917
Now, why don't you
begin the discussion
in a polite manner?

12:09.917 --> 12:11.125
What, just, like,
do it for fake?

12:11.125 --> 12:14.083
Talk to them
with some respect,
like equals.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.917
You set the tone here.

12:15.917 --> 12:21.375
Now, why don't you ask
Aaron what Travis said
that made him so upset?

12:21.375 --> 12:22.917
Fine. Go.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.083
He asked me
how his dick tastes.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.542
Okay. Uh, why was
it important

12:31.542 --> 12:33.000
for you to know
that information?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.083
Because I used to date Megan,

12:35.083 --> 12:37.291
and now he dates Megan,

12:37.291 --> 12:40.708
So I was like,
"How does my dick taste?"

12:40.708 --> 12:43.333
I'm just not really sure what
we're trying to figure out here.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.333
I mean, is this what
Circles is supposed to be like?

12:45.333 --> 12:46.708
We sit around on beanbags

12:46.708 --> 12:48.542
and discuss the flavor
of young boys' penises?

12:48.542 --> 12:49.917
Belinda:
Perhaps.

12:49.917 --> 12:50.917
This is the beginning.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.291
You guys were being honest.

12:52.291 --> 12:57.083
Now, why don't you
ask Travis if he's hurt

12:57.083 --> 12:59.500
that Aaron is now seeing Megan?

13:01.375 --> 13:03.834
Are you hurt
because they're boyfriends
and girlfriends?

13:03.834 --> 13:06.000
(scoffs)
Shit.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.500
I don't know.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.583
Maybe.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.208
I think it's time
for some popcorn.

13:37.708 --> 13:40.583
(Russell and Seychelles talking)

13:40.583 --> 13:42.208
Russell: You guys do shampoo?
Man: Yeah.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.083
I would be
the perfect Warren Beatty.
Oh, you--

13:44.083 --> 13:45.667
Yeah, you could!
You could do that.

13:45.667 --> 13:48.041
Oh, hi, Gamby.
Hi, Neil.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.542
Didn't see you around
much today, Russell.

13:50.542 --> 13:51.667
Well, I've been here.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.291
Not really sure
what you've been doing.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.875
We're about to go
get haircuts.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.166
Haircuts.
Yeah.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.166
Seychelles knows a barber
who's very gifted.
Yeah.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.667
He does the whole thing
with scissors.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.083
Never uses clippers
at any time.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.166
At any time.

14:02.166 --> 14:04.417
Big deal. I have a barber
who does the same thing.

14:04.417 --> 14:06.583
Huh. You got--
you got a nice haircut.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.375
Everything all right, Gamby?

14:08.375 --> 14:09.792
Everything's great.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.708
You didn't wait long, did ya?
Well, I'm not really sure

14:11.708 --> 14:13.417
what you're talking about.
Do whatever you want.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.625
It's fine.
I don't care.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.041
Interesting choice though.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.583
Don't you have anything better
to do than just stand around

14:18.583 --> 14:20.542
just bothering people
all the time, like a gnat?

14:20.542 --> 14:23.375
Just a... (buzzes)
flying around, everywhere.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.250
(buzzing)
Stop.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.417
Get out of here.
I have plenty to do.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.667
I'm about to achieve my goals,
but you have fun

14:29.667 --> 14:31.875
with the Fine Arts department
over here.
Oh, I-- I will.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.834
Good. I hope you do.
Oh, I am.

14:33.834 --> 14:36.500
Then do it. I don't care.
Oh, I will.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.333
Great. Fantastic.
Never see you again.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.834
Never talk to you
ever again in my life.

14:39.834 --> 14:42.500
Fine.
What is going on right now?

14:42.500 --> 14:43.667
Nothin'.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.375
He's just being a freak.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.625
Come on, Seychelles.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.458
You're being a little freak.
You are.

14:48.458 --> 14:51.625
You are... being a freak.
So tell me, do I look
like Warren Beatty a little bit?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.458
Out of the corner of my eye.
You do.
A little bit?

14:53.458 --> 14:55.792
Perfect.
I've slept with almost

14:55.792 --> 14:57.667
as much women
as he has.
Oh, yeah?

14:59.458 --> 15:02.125
(speaking Korean)

15:02.125 --> 15:04.125
Oh, Mexico.
Oh.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.291
Oh, taco.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.959
(both speaking Korean)
Howdy, neighbor.

15:07.959 --> 15:09.375
Oh, Jackie.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.792
Hello.

15:10.792 --> 15:11.917
Herro, Mi-Cha.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.125
Saw you guys walk in

15:13.125 --> 15:15.500
when I drove by.
Thought this might be

15:15.500 --> 15:18.125
a good chance
for us to chat.
About what?

15:18.125 --> 15:21.083
Oh, Lee told me
you haven't been
sleeping so well lately.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.959
Yeah, only when
you guys go really late.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.625
Usually it's not that bad.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.041
Well, I guess you're just
not used to the noises
that men make

15:28.041 --> 15:31.125
when they're strengthening
their bodies now, are ya?
(yells in Korean)

15:31.125 --> 15:32.291
(yelling)

15:32.291 --> 15:33.291
Okay, speak English!

15:33.291 --> 15:35.041
None of that "bing-ba" bullshit.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.667
I don't wanna fucking hear it.
Okay, Jackie,

15:36.667 --> 15:38.667
I don't really have time
to chat right now.

15:39.583 --> 15:40.625
Some neighborly advice.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.917
Don't call the cops
on me again.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.291
I hate cops.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.542
Okay, we have to go.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.041
Oh, one more thing.

15:50.041 --> 15:51.834
You should try smiling more.

15:51.834 --> 15:54.166
It'd make your face look
a lot better.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.834
Just sayin'.

16:02.250 --> 16:05.041
♪ ♪

16:21.333 --> 16:23.708
Well, I'm sure you're blowing
it out of proportion.

16:23.708 --> 16:24.875
It's a small town.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.208
Who cares?
You were both
in a grocery store.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.625
It's not like
he followed you in there.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.583
He said he saw me
in the parking lot

16:30.583 --> 16:31.917
and followed me in.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.708
Did you get a new haircut?

16:33.708 --> 16:36.000
Yes. I did.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.208
With a friend.
Who cares?

16:38.208 --> 16:40.542
Why don't you
concentrate on what
you're all fucked up about

16:40.542 --> 16:42.500
and ruining
my evening with? God.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.000
He's mad that
you called the police.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.083
I don't know
what he's gonna do, Lee.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.750
Mi-Cha's upset.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.208
You should go over there
and apologize.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.333
(dishes clatter)

16:51.333 --> 16:54.083
I literally just walked
in the door, Christine.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.083
My feet are killing me.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.417
Fine.

17:02.417 --> 17:03.417
Fine!

17:03.417 --> 17:05.959
Fucking bitch.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.125
(Jackie grunts)

17:07.125 --> 17:09.583
(weights clank)
Jackie: Fuck yeah!

17:09.583 --> 17:10.625
Jackie!

17:11.583 --> 17:13.458
Hey, you, uh,
you got a sec?

17:17.917 --> 17:19.125
What?

17:19.125 --> 17:22.166
Jackie, I-- I just--
I want to clear the air here.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.625
I-- I didn't mean
to piss you off

17:24.625 --> 17:26.166
about the whole
noise business.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.667
It was-- it was
just a suggestion.

Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.959
I owe you an apology.

27:33.959 --> 27:36.000
Maybe I haven't been
the best business partner.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.458
Business partner?

27:37.458 --> 27:39.208
You know, partner
in the partnership.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.250
You know what
I'm trying to say.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.667
I'm willing to try harder.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.750
It's just been
a really long time

27:44.750 --> 27:46.125
since I've been
in a partnership

27:46.125 --> 27:48.041
of any nature
with anybody,

27:48.041 --> 27:50.417
and I've forgotten
how to do it.

27:50.417 --> 27:52.834
I-- I don't want to take
Belinda Brown down by myself.

27:52.834 --> 27:54.375
I don't even think I could.

27:55.458 --> 27:56.750
To be honest, Gamby.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.083
I had all my own shit
going on over here,

27:59.083 --> 28:01.834
and it's just been
fucking me all up.

28:01.834 --> 28:03.834
I lashed out at you,

28:03.834 --> 28:04.875
and I'm sorry.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.834
What about Seychelles?

28:06.834 --> 28:08.333
Oh, please.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.083
Fuck that fucking fruitcake.

28:10.083 --> 28:11.583
Fuck that whole
Fine Arts department.

28:11.583 --> 28:14.000
Fuck the Fine Arts department.
(chuckles)

28:14.000 --> 28:17.417
Partnership back on?

28:17.417 --> 28:18.917
Re-engaged.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.500
Hey, man, those brass knuckles
were the real deal.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.917
Did you confiscate them?
Yep.

28:23.917 --> 28:25.542
Aaron Jeffries, sophomore.

28:25.542 --> 28:26.917
Can I see 'em?

28:26.917 --> 28:28.041
(door opens)
Yeah.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.125
Oh, my God. Lee!

28:30.125 --> 28:31.667
What is going on?

28:31.667 --> 28:33.000
What do you think's going on?

28:33.000 --> 28:35.834
I fucking handled shit.
Did you do this?

28:35.834 --> 28:37.667
Yes, baby, I did.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.291
(Mi-Cha speaking in Korean)

28:40.875 --> 28:42.375
(speaks Korean)
Yeah.

28:42.375 --> 28:43.458
Mi-Cha,

28:43.458 --> 28:45.583
watch this.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.250
Ooh.
Sleep, motherfucker!

28:49.875 --> 28:51.125
