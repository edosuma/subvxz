01:26.667 --> 01:28.033
Nuh!

01:33.534 --> 01:35.033
Peg!

01:35.033 --> 01:37.934
Dinner!

01:37.934 --> 01:39.801
Peg no home.

01:42.334 --> 01:45.434
She go shop.
We no eat.

01:45.434 --> 01:47.934
Kelly, why don't you cook up
old Dad something to eat?

01:47.934 --> 01:50.634
Daddy, I am practically a woman.

01:50.634 --> 01:52.367
I don't cook.

01:52.367 --> 01:55.300
Why don't you just do
what I do when I get hungry?

01:55.300 --> 01:57.033
Get a date.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.934
And slit your skirt
up to your chin.

02:03.901 --> 02:06.067
Bud, you don't date.
How do you eat?

02:06.067 --> 02:08.234
Well, just like
the proud Indian,

02:08.234 --> 02:09.901
I've learned
to live off the land.

02:09.901 --> 02:12.200
Now, for instance, well,
let me show you what I mean.

02:13.701 --> 02:14.868
Now...

02:16.434 --> 02:19.100
you see this crack
between the stove and the wall?

02:19.100 --> 02:21.968
Every now and then,
I'll find, say...a fuzzy M&M.

02:21.968 --> 02:23.000
Now...

02:23.000 --> 02:26.167
you just peel
the protective coating,

02:26.167 --> 02:29.567
and you've got a nice little
dose of simple carbohydrates,

02:29.567 --> 02:31.334
and don't throw away
that colorful shell.

02:31.334 --> 02:33.367
It makes a hearty base for soup.

02:34.934 --> 02:37.367
Well, then, I'll get the hanger,
and a little piece of gum,

02:37.367 --> 02:38.267
and a-hunting we will go.

02:41.467 --> 02:43.033
Oh, hi, Kelly.

02:43.033 --> 02:45.701
Honey, help me hide these
before your father gets home.

02:48.267 --> 02:49.567
Oh, ha ha.

02:49.567 --> 02:50.834
Hi, Al.

02:50.834 --> 02:52.601
Thanks, Peg.

02:52.601 --> 02:56.567
I had a French fry on the hook,
and you made me drop it.

02:58.634 --> 03:00.534
It'll be there tomorrow.

03:00.534 --> 03:02.734
You know, I have a bone
to pick with you, Al.

03:02.734 --> 03:05.133
There wouldn't be
any meat on it, would there?

03:05.133 --> 03:07.467
No.

03:07.467 --> 03:09.100
I am really upset.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.501
I went shopping today.

03:10.501 --> 03:12.400
You know, spending here,
spending there,

03:12.400 --> 03:15.400
to warm up
to some serious shopping.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.434
Well, just when
I was loose and ready...

03:17.434 --> 03:20.234
Bam! You ran out of money.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.968
Look at these bags.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.601
This is what you make, Al.

03:23.601 --> 03:25.067
All of it.

03:27.634 --> 03:31.701
I must be
the most patient woman on Earth.

03:31.701 --> 03:34.968
Kids, I am sorry
you had to hear this.

03:34.968 --> 03:37.267
Oh, I wasn't listening, Mom.

03:37.267 --> 03:39.868
Oh, um, Dad, could we have
some money to go out to dinner?

03:39.868 --> 03:41.167
Kids, today's Thursday.

03:41.167 --> 03:44.334
You know
we don't eat till Friday.

03:44.334 --> 03:47.167
Al, you are a total disgrace.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.868
Come here, kids.

03:48.868 --> 03:50.000
Here you go.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.367
You can always depend on Mom.

03:51.367 --> 03:52.801
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Mom.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.033
There. You happy, Al?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.000
Now, I'm broke too.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.701
Well, we may as well
face it.

04:05.701 --> 04:08.801
We just can't make it as
a single income family anymore.

04:08.801 --> 04:11.567
Me and the girls
talked about it over lunch,

04:11.567 --> 04:12.868
and we all agree,

04:12.868 --> 04:16.100
you'll just have to
get a second job.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.934
You're that afraid
I'll live out the year, Peg?

04:18.934 --> 04:21.367
What's wrong
with you getting a second job?

04:21.367 --> 04:24.834
Peg, let me state this
as clearly as I can.

04:24.834 --> 04:28.567
I would rather rip off my nose
with a can opener.

04:28.567 --> 04:31.300
I would rather
bob for apples in a sewer.

04:31.300 --> 04:36.000
I would rather have a catheter
the size of a garden hose...

04:36.000 --> 04:38.234
before I get another job
to pay for your shopping.

04:38.234 --> 04:42.300
Think it over.
We'll talk about it later.

04:42.300 --> 04:45.033
Damn ants got the gum.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.300
I have to get
one of my fishing rods.

04:48.601 --> 04:50.000
Oh, and Peg,
by the way,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.767
have I told you today
that I loved you?

04:52.767 --> 04:53.801
No, Al.

04:59.868 --> 05:02.300
Hi, Peggy.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.801
I know it's dinner time,

05:03.801 --> 05:07.033
but I wanted to catch you
before you called in your order.

05:07.033 --> 05:08.300
Gee, I'm glad you're here.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.133
I am working on a way
to increase our income.

05:11.133 --> 05:13.200
Oh, you looking
for a job?

05:13.200 --> 05:14.734
Oh, come on.

05:14.734 --> 05:16.167
It's for Al.

05:16.167 --> 05:19.033
He really needs a second job.

05:19.033 --> 05:20.767
I mean, he comes home from work,

05:20.767 --> 05:24.834
and has nothing to do
but sit back and watch that TV.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.701
That's no kind of life
for a man.

05:27.701 --> 05:30.167
This should revitalize him.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.467
Hey!

05:31.467 --> 05:34.701
"Chicken plucker."

05:34.701 --> 05:37.334
Pays more than a shoe salesman.

05:37.334 --> 05:38.601
Uh-oh.

05:38.601 --> 05:41.300
"Must have good personality."

05:41.300 --> 05:43.300
Oh, well.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.767
Hmm, "sperm donors."

05:47.567 --> 05:52.667
Whoops. They want someone
with experience.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.234
You know,

05:54.234 --> 05:56.701
I have a friend that runs
a pit-bull-training school.

05:56.701 --> 05:58.434
Does Al have a protective cup?

05:59.868 --> 06:02.067
What for?

06:02.067 --> 06:04.100
I'll put it down as a maybe.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.167
Yeah, well,
think about it.

06:05.167 --> 06:06.534
He could
work his way up

06:06.534 --> 06:08.868
to the guy with
the tranquilizer gun.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.167
Mm, I don't know.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.567
Al's aim
isn't very good.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.434
You've seen
our bathroom.

06:19.033 --> 06:20.901
And your children.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.901
Now, this looks perfect.

06:29.901 --> 06:31.501
"No skills,
no experience,

06:31.501 --> 06:34.300

06:34.300 --> 06:37.100
Well, that's everything
but his name.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.133
Listen.

06:38.133 --> 06:40.667

is looking for you

06:40.667 --> 06:42.567

06:49.400 --> 06:52.501
Those are dollar signs, Peg.

06:52.501 --> 06:55.267
Even better!

06:55.267 --> 06:56.834
Then it's settled.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.567
Al is gonna be a Patty girl.

06:58.567 --> 07:00.467
Don't you think you
should check with Al?

07:00.467 --> 07:01.567
Hey.

07:01.567 --> 07:04.234
I did not have two children
checking with Al.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.467
Generally, we feel

07:07.467 --> 07:09.801
you are your own
best advertisement,

07:09.801 --> 07:12.701
so we like our Patty girls
to wear our cosmetics.

07:12.701 --> 07:16.234
Would your husband have
a problem wearing makeup?

07:16.234 --> 07:20.467
Madam, my husband
sells women's shoes.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.300
Oh.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.367
Well, at least

07:23.367 --> 07:25.167
that shows
he'll do anything.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.501
Ugh...

07:32.901 --> 07:35.701
Very good.

07:35.701 --> 07:37.834
And, after a few months
of selling Patty products,

07:37.834 --> 07:39.868
he'll be able
to dump that day job.

07:39.868 --> 07:41.567
I dumped my day job.

07:41.567 --> 07:43.000
What was your day job?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.367
Phone sex.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.601
You make that much?

07:49.601 --> 07:51.868
Oh, this is too good for Al.
Tell me more.

07:51.868 --> 07:54.601
Well, there are
the Patty parties.

07:54.601 --> 07:55.767
You go to parties?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.434
That's the job.

07:57.434 --> 07:58.667
You see,
you throw parties,

07:58.667 --> 07:59.801
have your friends over,

07:59.801 --> 08:01.567
then watch the products
sell themselves

08:01.567 --> 08:03.234
while you just sit
and do nothing.

08:04.968 --> 08:07.801
Well, I can do that.

08:07.801 --> 08:11.267
And to think
I was just giving it away.

08:11.267 --> 08:12.667
Well, what do I need
to start?

08:12.667 --> 08:16.567
Just a deep and abiding
belief in makeup,

08:16.567 --> 08:20.934
and our super-deluxe
"Patty party starter" kit.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.300
Well, how much
does that cost?

08:22.300 --> 08:23.901
$250.

08:23.901 --> 08:25.834
Oh, but that's just
a drop in the bucket

08:25.834 --> 08:27.767
compared to your first
month's commish.

08:27.767 --> 08:30.734
Well, just how much commish
are we talking about?

08:34.267 --> 08:35.801
Whoa!

08:35.801 --> 08:36.933
Will you take a check?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.100
Sure.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.433
Does it have to be good?

08:39.433 --> 08:40.900
No.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.801
We'll just put a lien
against your husband's wages.

08:43.801 --> 08:45.000
I'm in!

08:49.467 --> 08:51.567
I did get last week's commish,

08:51.567 --> 08:55.634
and a nice commish it was too.

08:55.634 --> 08:58.167
Okay, here's this week's order.

08:58.167 --> 09:01.000
One dozen Patty powder puffs,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.200
a quart of Chin-Away,

09:03.200 --> 09:04.667
one dozen

"He'll Think It's
Someone Else's Eyes" liner,

09:08.334 --> 09:10.501
and one vat of "Unh" Perfume...

09:13.100 --> 09:16.133
in addition to my regular order.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.667
Okay, thanks,

09:17.667 --> 09:21.667
and you have a Patty day too!

09:21.667 --> 09:23.667
That was delicious, Daddy.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.334
Oh, yeah.

09:25.334 --> 09:27.000
We're sorry
you didn't have enough money

09:27.000 --> 09:29.567
for you to eat, Dad.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.767
Well, that's okay.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.701
That sugar water
really filled me up.

09:33.701 --> 09:36.300
What matters is that you two
had a nice, nutritious meal.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.167
I just hope
my begging and whining

09:38.167 --> 09:39.767
didn't bother you.

09:39.767 --> 09:43.267
Well, not after we had
the waiter kick you out.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.501
Al, can I ask you something?

09:45.501 --> 09:49.000
No, we can't
have any more children.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.567
Not that.

09:50.567 --> 09:54.133
If ever the day should come
when I find a little job,

09:54.133 --> 09:56.334
is it all right
if I keep the money I make?

09:56.334 --> 09:58.033
Peg, if ever the day should come

09:58.033 --> 10:00.334
when somebody pays you
for what you do,

10:00.334 --> 10:01.567
grab it and spend it quickly,

10:01.567 --> 10:05.234
because the world
is coming to an end.

10:05.234 --> 10:06.968
Thank you, Al.

10:06.968 --> 10:08.067
Thank you.

10:08.067 --> 10:11.167
Look what I made.

10:11.167 --> 10:12.667
Look,
it's a check...

10:12.667 --> 10:14.100
with Mom's name
on it.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.968
We love you, Mommy.

10:21.334 --> 10:22.901
Save your breath.

10:22.901 --> 10:24.934
Daddy said
I could keep it.

10:24.934 --> 10:26.100
Okay, Peg.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.734
I know that Oprah
isn't paying people

10:27.734 --> 10:30.067
to watch her show
with their mouths open,

10:30.067 --> 10:31.534
so how'd you
get the money?

10:31.534 --> 10:34.067
I'm a Patty Brite girl.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.934
I sell cosmetics
in my spare time.

10:36.934 --> 10:38.801
So it's a full-time job?

10:40.434 --> 10:44.934
No, but it's full-time pay.

10:44.934 --> 10:48.167
Gee, Dad, Mom
makes more than you.

10:48.167 --> 10:52.601
Do we still have
to call him "Dad"?

10:52.601 --> 10:55.033
Or do we
call you "Dad"?

10:55.033 --> 10:57.934
Well, I think
the check speaks for itself.

10:57.934 --> 11:00.234
Let's go to the mall now.
You can watch me spend.

11:03.868 --> 11:05.901
Dad, can you
pinpoint for us

11:05.901 --> 11:08.901
the exact moment that
life passed you by?

11:08.901 --> 11:11.834
Son, life didn't pass me by...

love you, Daddy.

any respect for you.

12:31.634 --> 12:34.534
WOMAN:
 <i>Then someday you will.</i>

12:35.968 --> 12:37.067
Yeah, right, Mom.

12:37.067 --> 12:39.634
Try saying that
when you're sober.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.534
[DOORBELL RINGS]

12:47.634 --> 12:49.033
Oh, what do you want, Steve?

12:49.033 --> 12:51.033
I was about to eat
and fight cavities.

12:54.734 --> 12:57.167
I just heard the news
about Peggy's income.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.234
Well, actually,
I didn't hear it.

12:59.234 --> 13:02.667
The neighborhood women
spray-painted it on your car.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.567
You sure it was paint?

13:04.567 --> 13:06.367
Or was it man blood?

13:06.367 --> 13:08.868
Aw, buck up, Al.

13:08.868 --> 13:10.567
So Peggy's got a
bigger income than you.

13:10.567 --> 13:11.734
So what?

13:11.734 --> 13:14.234
Does that make you
less of a man?

13:14.234 --> 13:16.801
Oh, sure, if you believe
what's written on your car.

13:16.801 --> 13:18.634
But, that aside, there
are plenty of positives

13:18.634 --> 13:19.968
to a two-income family.

13:19.968 --> 13:23.567
Like what, begging the wife
for some extra cash?

13:23.567 --> 13:25.534
Well, if you
ask her just right,

13:25.534 --> 13:28.934
you can walk away
with some nice pin money.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.801
I know,
you give up a little--

13:30.801 --> 13:32.868
Steve, you've seen my life.

13:32.868 --> 13:34.334
A little is all I've got.

13:36.133 --> 13:37.868
I know, Al,

13:37.868 --> 13:39.601
but the important thing is,

13:39.601 --> 13:42.834
women have to work
for their self-esteem.

13:42.834 --> 13:44.334
I'm proud of Marcie.

13:44.334 --> 13:47.033
I mean, even if we have to
share the cooking duties

13:47.033 --> 13:49.501
because she's tired from work.

13:49.501 --> 13:53.267
Of course, my mother worked
and she cooked every day.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.067
Good too.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.334
Not like those
frozen fish sticks

13:56.334 --> 13:59.367
and Tater Tots
Marcie calls dinner.

13:59.367 --> 14:01.367
But I'm happy.

14:01.367 --> 14:05.133
Yep, I'm just a...

14:07.467 --> 14:10.400
A happy Tater-Totting,
fish-sticking man.

14:15.634 --> 14:18.100
Pretty pathetic,
Steve.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.567
No kidding.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.100
Well, at least
yours has a skill.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.133
I mean, if Peggy could
nag in sign language,

14:24.133 --> 14:27.601
she wouldn't need
a head at all.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.767
How can she
earn more than me?

14:29.767 --> 14:30.634
I can't...

14:35.033 --> 14:37.434
Would you like some floss
with that, Steve?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.734
I can't let her beat me.

14:41.734 --> 14:42.834
What I have to do

14:42.834 --> 14:44.634
is get a second job
and not tell Peg.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.868
That way, I'll seem like
I'm a better salesman than her,

14:46.868 --> 14:48.968
and I'll get back
my self-respect.

 CAPTAIN [OVER INTERCOM]:
 <i>Beam me up a burger, Bundy,</i>

 <i>That's right.</i>

Whoosh.

15:52.901 --> 15:54.033
Hey...

15:54.033 --> 15:56.267
we got a lot of unhappy
passengers out there,

15:56.267 --> 15:58.167

15:58.167 --> 15:59.601
Talk to me
like a person.

15:59.601 --> 16:02.868
Oh, um, like, okay, like,
old dude...

16:05.400 --> 16:08.334
um, I had to leave the bridge
to tell you this, but, um,

16:08.334 --> 16:10.501
we've had lots of complaints
about this burger.

16:10.501 --> 16:11.534
What's wrong?

16:11.534 --> 16:13.033
You tell me what's wrong.

16:13.033 --> 16:15.033
Some pouch get in there?

16:17.267 --> 16:19.934
Look, there's no place at
Burger Trek for a rebel, Bundy.

16:19.934 --> 16:21.534
Come on, you know,
we've got, like,

16:21.534 --> 16:23.567
a mission to accomplish.

16:23.567 --> 16:27.467
BOTH:
To go where no burger
has gone before.

16:27.467 --> 16:28.934
Okay. Yeah, right.
That's good.

16:28.934 --> 16:32.934
Well, let's just start
from the beginning, okay?

16:32.934 --> 16:34.801
What goes on
a hamburger?

16:34.801 --> 16:37.200
Tomato, onion,
ketchup, pickle,

16:37.200 --> 16:40.968
and a squirt
of beef squeezings.

16:40.968 --> 16:42.734
Okay, now, that is
our special sauce, Bundy,

16:42.734 --> 16:43.834
and that goes on last.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.100
You've been putting yours on
first,

16:45.100 --> 16:48.567
and it's been washing
the coloring off the tomatoes.

16:50.501 --> 16:52.501
Get with the program, Bundy.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.267
You're a disgrace to the hat.

16:54.267 --> 16:56.334
Aw, clean your station.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.300

17:13.800 --> 17:15.767
You know,
when I took this job,

17:15.767 --> 17:18.300
they didn't say
anything about cooking.

17:22.067 --> 17:22.934
Ugh.

17:32.934 --> 17:36.968
Oh, there's some
burger fur in there.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.667
And why isn't
Bundy doing this?

17:38.667 --> 17:41.601
The captain didn't think
he was ready.

17:41.601 --> 17:43.934
I mean, look at
the poor old guy.

17:43.934 --> 17:46.467
I mean,
why would

17:46.467 --> 17:49.501
a 60-year-old man

17:49.501 --> 17:51.901
want to work
in this dump?

17:51.901 --> 17:53.167
To meet chicks.

18:01.033 --> 18:03.267
Oh, Bundy, Bundy, Bundy.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.367
Whoosh!

18:08.367 --> 18:10.100
No, no, no, no.
It's not that.

18:10.100 --> 18:13.300
Look. You pulled
another burger boner.

18:15.434 --> 18:17.567
What did I do,
send one out hot?

18:17.567 --> 18:19.634
No, you sent one out
without onions.

18:19.634 --> 18:21.267
Damn.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.400
Look, Bundy,

18:22.400 --> 18:24.834
hey, I'm not a bad guy.

18:24.834 --> 18:27.901
Let's just talk, like,
you know, dude to dude, okay?

18:27.901 --> 18:29.100
See, I'm up on the bridge,

18:29.100 --> 18:30.534
and I'm trying
to do my homework.

I mean, what do you
want me to do, like,

18:32.567 --> 18:37.033

like, a bum or a shoe salesman?

18:37.033 --> 18:41.000
Look. Look,
just get back to work.

have fired my dad.

commission check

19:03.400 --> 19:06.067

cosmetics.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.801
How does she do it, Steve?

19:07.801 --> 19:09.067
How can she make more money

19:09.067 --> 19:12.100
than a man who sells
shoes and burgers?

19:12.100 --> 19:16.968
Al, I made more than you
losing a tooth when I was a kid.

19:19.634 --> 19:23.300
Well, how would you like to make
a fortune tonight, Steve?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.000

She can't sell
more than me.

19:30.801 --> 19:33.501

must be morons.

19:33.501 --> 19:34.734
A list of idiots
like that

be worth a fortune

19:37.334 --> 19:40.968
Damn! I wish I could
find that list.

19:40.968 --> 19:42.334
Well, maybe
there's a clue

19:42.334 --> 19:45.367
in this book that says,
"Peggy's customers."

19:45.367 --> 19:48.901
Give me that, Steve.
That might be it.

19:48.901 --> 19:50.334
Now, get a pen,
write this down.

Look, Al, why don't
we just skip over her

20:03.334 --> 20:04.334
and get to the people

20:04.334 --> 20:05.334

bought the cosmetics.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.601
Alrighty.

She's her own
customer, Steve!

buying all this stuff herself.

please?

20:52.934 --> 20:54.767
What is it, Al?

20:54.767 --> 20:56.267
Did I get another
commission check?

20:56.267 --> 20:59.167
Did I? Did I? Huh? Huh?

20:59.167 --> 21:00.200
Yes, you did.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.300
Whee!

21:02.300 --> 21:04.601
Yes, "whee" indeed.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.300
Peg, since you're now
an entrepreneur,

21:06.300 --> 21:08.100
I thought it might
be a good idea

21:08.100 --> 21:11.067
for you to learn something
about business.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.801
From you?

21:12.801 --> 21:15.501
Why not? You've taken
everything else from me.

21:15.501 --> 21:18.434
You see, pookie,

21:18.434 --> 21:21.601
since you're the only one
buying your cosmetics,

21:21.601 --> 21:23.000
you're not really
making any money.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.033
Oh, yes, I am.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.534
They send me checks.

21:26.534 --> 21:27.701
Ah, yes,

21:27.701 --> 21:29.734
but you send them
much bigger ones,

21:29.734 --> 21:32.267
and that's what we call
in the world of business

21:32.267 --> 21:35.267
"sending your husband
 <i>rocketing</i> to the poorhouse."

21:36.934 --> 21:39.033
Why didn't you
sell any makeup, Peg?

21:39.033 --> 21:41.834
Well, like
I told the girls,

21:41.834 --> 21:44.767
it's not very good.

21:44.767 --> 21:46.801
Well, then, why did
you keep buying it?

21:46.801 --> 21:49.501
'Cause that's how
I make my money.

21:53.567 --> 21:56.267
How much do we owe
for the cosmetics, Peg?

21:56.267 --> 21:57.701
Minus my commission?

21:58.567 --> 22:00.467
Yes.

22:02.267 --> 22:05.968
$623.

22:05.968 --> 22:10.200
Well, at least you're
not in real estate.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.501
