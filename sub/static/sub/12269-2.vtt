00:01.772 --> 00:03.034
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.034 --> 00:04.375
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.375 --> 00:06.737
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:06.737 --> 00:09.710
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH...

00:09.710 --> 00:11.482
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.482 --> 00:13.214
AND I WON'T STOP

00:13.214 --> 00:15.186
UNTIL THEY'VE ALL PAID
 THE PRICE.

00:15.186 --> 00:17.188
HE SHOWED UP THE NIGHT
OF CONRAD'S ELECTION.

00:17.188 --> 00:19.290
I HAD NO DOUBT THAT
HE WAS MY FIRSTBORN.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.492
MARGAUX LeMARCHAL.
 PASCAL LeMARCHAL'S DAUGHTER.

00:21.492 --> 00:23.354
I'M A FAN OF ALL
OF HIS PUBLICATIONS,

00:23.354 --> 00:25.696
ESPECIALLY "VOULEZ."
 THAT'S WHY I'VE MOVED HERE--

00:25.696 --> 00:27.328

THE AMERICAN VERSION.

FOR WHAT HAPPENED

00:31.702 --> 00:34.335

 I WILL LET THEM SUFFER.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.337
THESE ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE
DOING TERRIBLE THINGS.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.109

THEN LEAVE FOR GOOD,

00:38.109 --> 00:39.340
OR I'LL TELL EVERYONE
THE TRUTH.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.412
LET'S GET MARRIED
BEFORE THE END OF THE SUMMER.

00:41.412 --> 00:43.244
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 SAME THING AS YOU--

00:43.244 --> 00:45.146
LOOKING TO DESTROY
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.

00:47.278 --> 00:49.049
IT IS BELIEVED
 THAT ORIGINAL SIN

00:49.049 --> 00:52.553
CAN ONLY BE CLEANSED
 BY THE WATERS OF BAPTISM.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.285
BUT IT IS THE SINS
 THAT FOLLOW

00:54.285 --> 00:57.057
THAT ARE NOT SO EASILY
 WASHED AWAY.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.130
AND SINCE FORGIVENESS
 OF TRESPASS

00:59.130 --> 01:02.193
IS ONLY GRANTED
 TO THE TRULY PENITENT,

01:02.193 --> 01:05.566
PURE EVIL CAN NEVER BE ERASED.

OR MAYBE YOU CAN...

01:43.834 --> 01:46.877

TREACHERY LIT A FIRE INSIDE YOU.

01:46.877 --> 01:49.780
DO NOT MAKE INFERENCES
TO MY PAST,

01:49.780 --> 01:52.813
NOR TRY TO COMPEL ME
BY STRAINING TO LINK DAVID

01:52.813 --> 01:55.446

IS UP TO.

01:55.446 --> 01:58.519

02:00.120 --> 02:02.423
ONCE UPON A TIME...

02:02.423 --> 02:04.895
DAVID CLARKE ATTEMPTED
TO DESTROY YOUR LIVELIHOOD.

02:04.895 --> 02:07.228

02:07.228 --> 02:09.699

A SCAMMER LIKE EMILY
HAS, UH, OTHER MOTIVES.

WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU?
 BECAUSE I DID IT
WITH THEM.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.170

WHAT THEY WANTED,

02:19.170 --> 02:20.511

06:15.776 --> 06:28.058
COULDN'T AGREE MORE, FATHER.

06:31.462 --> 06:32.723
THEN I DID SOME
MISSIONARY WORK OVERSEAS

06:32.723 --> 06:35.165
BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED
TO ST. FRANCIS.

06:35.165 --> 06:38.669
THAT'S QUITE A RADICAL SHIFT
FROM THE CORPORATE LIFE.

06:38.669 --> 06:40.070
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

06:40.070 --> 06:42.603
WELL, I WAS THERE
FOR THE DAVID CLARKE SCANDAL.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.034
AND WHEN HE DIED IN PRISON,

06:44.034 --> 06:46.777
IT REALLY HIT ME
WHAT GREED CAN DO TO A SOUL.

06:46.777 --> 06:49.810
SO I LOOKED OUT MY OFFICE WINDOW
AND ALL THE WAY UPTOWN,

06:49.810 --> 06:51.782
AND I KNEW THAT THERE WERE
MILLIONS OF SOULS

06:51.782 --> 06:54.615

THAT I COULD HELP

06:54.615 --> 06:56.687

HELPED HIM.

06:56.687 --> 07:00.751

JOINED THE SEMINARY,

TO PRESIDE OVER THEIR WEDDING.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.738
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
CONSIDERING IT.

09:27.738 --> 09:28.899
I FEEL IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.001
IT'S THE REASON I'M HERE.
 WHY?

09:31.001 --> 09:34.204
TO SHAME US OVER EVENTS
BEST RELEGATED TO HISTORY?

09:34.204 --> 09:35.876
TO HELP PUT THEM TO REST.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.708
(clicks tongue) OH.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.049
WELL, WHILE I APPRECIATE
YOUR ARROGANCE,

09:39.049 --> 09:41.211
I'M DOING JUST FINE,
THANK YOU.

09:41.211 --> 09:43.754
I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME FOR CONRAD.

09:43.754 --> 09:45.716
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO TAKE A RUN AT HIM.

09:45.716 --> 09:50.220
BUT HE'S ALWAYS VIEWED GOD
 AS A COMPETITOR.

09:56.226 --> 09:57.668
HEY, BOSS.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.031
OH... (mutters)

10:01.031 --> 10:03.033
WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN YOUR BOSS
SINCE YOU QUIT

10:03.033 --> 10:04.835
SOMETIME LAST CENTURY.

10:04.835 --> 10:07.607
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU WEREN'T TALKING TO ME,

10:07.607 --> 10:09.309
IN WHICH CASE,
YOU SHOULD BE AWARE

10:09.309 --> 10:13.043
THAT HE... IS NOT HERE.

10:13.043 --> 10:15.115
NO, I'M HERE TO SEE YOU,
CONRAD.
 OH?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.717
AND I THINK YOU MAY
NEED ME.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.389
OH, PLEASE, DO SPARE ME
THE PIOUS PRIEST ACT.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.391
THE PAUL I KNEW COULD SELL
ICE TO AN ESKIMO

10:21.391 --> 10:23.654
AND NOT BE AFRAID
TO GET HIS HANDS

10:23.654 --> 10:24.895
FILTHY IN THE DOING OF IT.

10:24.895 --> 10:26.827
I'M THE SAME GUY.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.729
JUST SELLING SOMETHING
OF HIGHER VALUE.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.631
SELLING?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.834
OH, GOD, OF COURSE,
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.766
LOOK, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN

10:35.766 --> 10:39.239
MORE THAN ADEQUATELY
COMPENSATED FOR YOUR SILENCE.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.370
(lid clinks)
 YOU DON'T NEED TO REMIND ME

10:40.370 --> 10:41.872
OF SOMETHING THAT STILL
TORMENTS ME.

10:41.872 --> 10:43.213
WELL, I COULD HAVE TRIED
TO TELL YOU

10:43.213 --> 10:45.015
THAT COLLAR WASN'T GONNA
DO YOU ANY GOOD.

10:45.015 --> 10:46.316
AND I'M GLAD
I DIDN'T LISTEN.

10:46.316 --> 10:49.019
WELL...

10:49.019 --> 10:51.181
HEY, WHATEVER YOU NEED
TO SLEEP AT NIGHT,

10:51.181 --> 10:54.885
BUT, YOU KNOW, DON'T FORGET
THAT UNLIKE YOUR FLOCK,

10:54.885 --> 10:57.427
I KNOW FIRSTHAND THAT
THAT SOUL OF YOURS

10:57.427 --> 11:00.390
IS... FAR FROM UNBLEMISHED.

11:00.390 --> 11:04.094
I ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS.
I FOUND PEACE IN MY PENANCE.

11:04.094 --> 11:06.737
AND I'M HERE TO SUGGEST
THAT YOUR HUNTINGTON'S

11:06.737 --> 11:09.099
IS THE LORD'S WAY
OF FORCING YOU TO DO THE SAME--

11:09.099 --> 11:10.941
TO ATONE FOR YOUR SINS.

11:10.941 --> 11:12.943
LOOK, I WILL NOT IMPUTE
TO GENETIC ANOMALY

11:12.943 --> 11:14.674
WITH THE ACTS OF
A VENGEFUL DEITY.

11:14.674 --> 11:19.379
THIS IS A MATTER OF SCIENCE,
NOT RELIGION, FATHER.

11:19.379 --> 11:23.854
YOU CAN BELIEVE ME OR NOT.

11:23.854 --> 11:27.157
BUT I'VE SEEN
A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFER.

11:27.157 --> 11:30.721
AND WHEN THEY DO,
IT CAUSES THEM...

11:30.721 --> 11:33.423
TO LOOK AT WHO THEY'LL BE
WHEN THEY DIE.

11:33.423 --> 11:36.426
THE ACT OF ACKNOWLEDGING
YOUR SINS IS TERRIFYING.

11:36.426 --> 11:37.728
BUT I'VE LEARNED THAT
IT'S BETTER TO BE

11:37.728 --> 11:41.431
HONESTLY UNHAPPY
THAN DISHONESTLY SO.

11:41.431 --> 11:42.733
OH.

11:42.733 --> 11:45.275
WELL...

11:45.275 --> 11:47.337
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D LIKE TO CONFESS

11:47.337 --> 11:52.042
THAT I AM HONESTLY UNHAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.845
(chuckles) OKAY.

11:54.845 --> 11:56.086
YOU CAN MAKE FUN.

11:56.086 --> 11:58.849
BUT TIMES LIKE THESE
REQUIRE SUPPORT.

11:58.849 --> 12:01.121
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE ALONE IN THIS ROOM

12:01.121 --> 12:02.452
BECAUSE
YOU MAY NOT HAVE IT.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.795
WE MAY NO LONGER SEE
EYE-TO-EYE,

12:04.795 --> 12:06.726
BUT I'LL ALWAYS
BE HERE FOR YOU.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.030
(footsteps depart)

12:10.030 --> 12:12.803
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SHOCK
WHEN A MAN PARACHUTES

12:12.803 --> 12:14.835
INTO THE FIRST PARTY
I ATTEND HERE.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.337
(chuckles)
 NOLAN ROSS DOES KNOW
HOW TO GET ATTENTION.

12:17.337 --> 12:21.041
MM, AND FOR GOOD REASON.
HE'S BRILLIANT.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.773
UNPREDICTABLE.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.045
ON THE CUTTING EDGE
OF FASHION.
 NOW YOU ASK ME,

12:25.045 --> 12:26.947
ROSS IS WHAT LED
TO MY FATHER'S COLLAPSE.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.448
WELL, THEN MAYBE
WE SHOULD SHIP HIM OFF

12:28.448 --> 12:31.251
TO MEET MINE. (chuckles)

12:31.251 --> 12:32.853
WELL, AT LEAST YOUR FATHER
GAVE YOU PERMISSION

12:32.853 --> 12:35.325
TO BRING "VOULEZ" TO THE STATES.
 MM.

12:35.325 --> 12:38.458
THE NAME IS THE EXTENT
OF PASCAL'S GENEROSITY.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.361
IF PAPA HAD HIS WAY,
HIS ONLY DAUGHTER

12:41.361 --> 12:43.834
WOULD JOIN THE BOARD
OF A CHARITY AND GET MARRIED.

12:43.834 --> 12:46.797
HMM... IT'S NOT SO BAD,
REALLY.

12:46.797 --> 12:48.869
OH, MY GOODNESS.
NO, NO, NO.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.201
I-I MEANT NOTHING BY THAT.
NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
 OH, NO.

12:51.201 --> 12:52.873
NO, I THINK
I'M JUST PREOCCUPIED

12:52.873 --> 12:56.476
WITH MATTERS AT HAND--
FINDING RELIABLE ADVERTISERS...
 MM.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.479
AND INVESTORS
WITH DEEP POCKETS.

12:59.479 --> 13:03.283
OR YOU COULD JUST HIRE
SOMEONE TO DO THAT FOR YOU.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.117
WITH MY BUSINESS EXPERIENCE,
WE CAN MAKE A GOOD RUN AT THIS.

13:07.117 --> 13:10.891
MY FATHER ATTRIBUTES
TWO OF HIS DIVORCES

13:10.891 --> 13:12.893
TO THE DEMANDS OF "VOULEZ."

13:12.893 --> 13:15.125
I, OF COURSE, ATTRIBUTE IT
TO MY FATHER.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.797
BUT I COULDN'T LIVE
WITH MYSELF

13:17.797 --> 13:19.529
IF I TOOK AWAY
YOUR FIRST YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

13:19.529 --> 13:20.831
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF

13:20.831 --> 13:23.373
IF I PREVENTED HIM
FROM PURSUING A DREAM.

13:23.373 --> 13:25.535
WHY DON'T I LEAVE
YOU TWO TO TALK?

13:25.535 --> 13:28.308
EXCUSE ME.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.314
(indistinct conversations)

13:34.314 --> 13:36.446
CHARLOTTE?

13:36.446 --> 13:39.349
NICE TO SEE YOU HERE.
 I CAME HERE TO SURPRISE
DANIEL AND MARGAUX,

13:39.349 --> 13:42.122
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
"FOUR'S A CROWD."

13:42.122 --> 13:43.854
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

13:43.854 --> 13:47.027
YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON
I TOLD

13:47.027 --> 13:48.959
ABOUT MY MOTHER'S
SUPPOSED AFFAIR.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.260
NEXT THING I KNOW,

13:50.260 --> 13:52.232
IT'S GOTTEN BACK TO HER
THROUGH ASHLEY.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.105
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

13:55.105 --> 13:57.337
ASHLEY MUST HAVE FOUND OUT
SOME OTHER WAY.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.039
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
HOW NOSY SHE IS.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.111
YOU KNOW, I USED TO DEFEND YOU
WHEN MY MOTHER WOULD

14:01.111 --> 14:02.612
GO ON ONE
OF HER EMILY RANTS,

14:02.612 --> 14:04.174
BUT NOW I THINK
I'LL STAY QUIET.

14:04.174 --> 14:06.046
CHARLOTTE, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET,

14:06.046 --> 14:07.277
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

14:07.277 --> 14:09.019
AND ANYWAY, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF GOSSIP.

14:09.019 --> 14:11.551
A LITTLE BIT OF GOSSIP?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.223
MAYBE YOU DON'T GET
THAT EVEN ONE TINY LIE

14:13.223 --> 14:14.885
CAN CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE.

14:14.885 --> 14:17.888
CHARLOTTE, PLEASE.

14:17.888 --> 14:20.060
YOU WERE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
LEFT IN MY LIFE

14:20.060 --> 14:21.631
I FELT CONNECTED TO.

14:21.631 --> 14:24.935
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TRUST YOU ANYMORE.

14:24.935 --> 14:26.997
SO THANKS FOR THE CONCERN,

14:26.997 --> 14:29.039
BUT NO, THANKS.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.881
(grunts)

14:41.881 --> 14:43.883
(sniffs) MMM.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.087
HEY, PERFECT TIMING, EMS.

14:47.087 --> 14:50.120
I PICKED UP A NEW HOBBY
WORKING IN THE PRISON KITCHEN.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.593
SEE, IT TURNS OUT THAT, UH,
BLUEBERRY MUFFINS

14:53.593 --> 14:56.266
CAN CALM EVEN THE MOST
SOCIOPATHIC HEART.

14:56.266 --> 14:58.328
I SHOULD HAVE ONE.

14:58.328 --> 15:00.100
FIRST I LOSE JACK
FOR TELLING THE TRUTH,

15:00.100 --> 15:03.433
THEN I LOSE CHARLOTTE
FOR LYING.
 THEN TAKE A BREATHER.

15:03.433 --> 15:08.108
(opens and closes drawer)
 ESPECIALLY SINCE THE GUY ON DECK
IS NOT ONLY A PRIEST,

15:08.108 --> 15:13.313
BUT PRACTICALLY
THE MOTHER TERESA OF THE BRONX.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.987
GOT A LIBRARY CARD
IN LIEU OF Wi-Fi.

15:16.987 --> 15:18.448
EVERY OTHER TAKEDOWN

15:18.448 --> 15:21.621
HAD HISTORIES THAT READ
LIKE RAP SHEETS, BUT...

15:21.621 --> 15:25.025
ALL SIGNS POINT TO PAUL
BEING A GOOD MAN.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.957
(newspaper rustles, thuds)
 WELL, MY FATHER
WAS A BETTER MAN.

15:26.957 --> 15:28.358
RIGHT. THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO EMILY--

15:28.358 --> 15:32.002
SIN UNTO OTHERS AS YOU'VE HAD
SINNED UNTO YOU.
 RIGHT.

15:32.002 --> 15:33.503
THIS TIME, I JUST--

15:33.503 --> 15:35.135
I KINDA THINK
YOU'RE GOING TOO FAR.
 (sighs)

15:35.135 --> 15:36.967
IF--IF YOU CANNOT
FORGIVE PAUL,

15:36.967 --> 15:39.469
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO BE FORGIVEN?
 I DON'T.

15:39.469 --> 15:42.172
LOOK, I HAVE TWO MONTHS
BEFORE THE WEDDING,

15:42.172 --> 15:44.344
WHICH MEANS I'M NOT
PULLING ANY PUNCHES.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.577
JUST CHECK YOUR SOUL,
EMILY THORNE,

15:47.577 --> 15:50.420
'CAUSE ONCE YOU START
TAKING DOWN KITTENS,

15:50.420 --> 15:52.152
I'M OUT.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.724
(footsteps depart)

16:04.264 --> 16:06.396
UNHAND MY PAINTING
THIS INSTANT.

16:06.396 --> 16:10.070
UH, PAY NO MIND TO THE LADY
OF THE HOUSE, GENTLEMEN.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.073
AS YOU WERE.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.404
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT YOU HAD

16:14.404 --> 16:17.077
AT LEAST A FEW MORE MONTHS
BEFORE DEMENTIA KICKED IN.

16:17.077 --> 16:17.707
CHARMING.

16:17.707 --> 16:19.979
MAINTAINING STABLES,

16:19.979 --> 16:21.981
STANDING SUITES
AT THE SOUTH FORK,

16:21.981 --> 16:25.015
AND OUR YACHT YOU'VE SUDDENLY
GROWN FOND OF AGAIN,

16:25.015 --> 16:26.616
ACTUALLY COSTS MONEY.

16:26.616 --> 16:28.058
AUCTIONING OFF
ONE OF THE PIECES

16:28.058 --> 16:29.689
FROM YOUR COLLECTION
THIS AFTERNOON

16:29.689 --> 16:33.693
WILL KEEP US AFLOAT...
FOR JUNE.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.994
OH, AND WHEN, PRAY TELL,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.067
WILL YOU BE SACRIFICING
YOUR FERRARI?

16:37.067 --> 16:40.270
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT IN JULY.
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

16:40.270 --> 16:42.272
YOU'VE SUDDENLY FOUND
OUR STOLEN MILLIONS?

16:42.272 --> 16:45.605
(doorbell rings)
 (scoffs) JULY IT IS.

16:45.605 --> 16:49.439
(front door opens and closes)
 MISS THORNE.

16:49.439 --> 16:51.181
I DECIDED TO DO
SOME BAKING.

16:51.181 --> 16:53.083
I THOUGHT I'D... SHARE.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.714
THEY'RE BLUEBERRY.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.148
THAT'S MY FAVORITE.
HOW CONSIDERATE...

16:58.148 --> 17:02.322
(chuckles)
 AND IRONIC THAT MY WIFE
IS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THIS FAMILY

17:02.322 --> 17:04.324
WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ME.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.694
EXCUSE ME.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.060
WELL, I MET
YOUR OFFICIANT TODAY,

17:10.060 --> 17:12.031
OR I SHOULD SAY "RE-MET."

17:12.031 --> 17:13.703
I REALLY WISH THAT YOU WOULD
CLEAR SUCH THINGS WITH ME.

17:13.703 --> 17:16.636
OH, FORGIVE ME, VICTORIA,
BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT

17:16.636 --> 17:18.468
YOU AND FATHER PAUL
HAD A HISTORY,

17:18.468 --> 17:20.740
I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MEND ANOTHER FENCE.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.811
ANOTHER?
 WELL, LIKE PATRICK.

17:22.811 --> 17:25.775
I IMAGINE YOU WANT HIM TO BE
A PART OF OUR PERFECT DAY.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.778
OH, YOU'RE KIND
TO POUR SUGAR ON THAT WOUND,

17:28.778 --> 17:31.481
BUT I PREFER
TO KEEP HIM SEPARATE.

17:31.481 --> 17:34.454
OH, WELL, I SUPPOSE
PATRICK'S USED TO IT.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.826
THAT IS A SHAME, THOUGH.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SO HAPPY.

17:36.826 --> 17:39.189
BUT CONSIDERING
YOUR FAMILY'S CURRENT STATE,

17:39.189 --> 17:42.432
I UNDERSTAND.
WHO KNOWS HOW THEY'D REACT?

17:42.432 --> 17:45.195
WELL, YOU'RE BUSY.
I SHOULD GO.

17:51.771 --> 17:55.074
PUT THAT PAINTING BACK.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.806
I HAVE ANOTHER PIECE
IN MIND.

17:56.806 --> 18:00.110
(whimpering)

18:00.110 --> 18:01.851
THEY LIKE YOU.

18:01.851 --> 18:04.214
(dog yelps)

18:04.214 --> 18:06.816
(sighs)

18:06.816 --> 18:10.190
(whimpering continues)

18:10.190 --> 18:11.761
YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHERE
SAMMY CAME RUNNING UP TO YOU

18:11.761 --> 18:13.263
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.695
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

18:15.695 --> 18:17.867
IF I HADN'T BROUGHT HIM
TO THE PARK THAT DAY.

18:17.867 --> 18:21.271
I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL, JACK.
 DO YOU?

18:21.271 --> 18:24.234
'CAUSE IT KEEPS CHANGING
FOR ME...

18:24.234 --> 18:27.277
EVERY TIME CHARLOTTE
COMES BY.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.809
I HATE MYSELF
FOR GOING ALONG WITH THIS.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.582
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY I STOPPED
WHEN I SAW YOU. I...

18:32.582 --> 18:35.345
(sighs)
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

18:35.345 --> 18:36.886
WELL, SO AM I,
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

18:36.886 --> 18:38.218
YOU'RE THE SOURCE
OF MOST OF HER PAIN.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.349
UNLESS YOU'RE HERE
TO GIVE ME PERMISSION

18:39.349 --> 18:40.720
TO TELL HER THE TRUTH.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.822
I CAN'T DO THAT, JACK.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.754
NOT BEFORE THE END
OF THE SUMMER, RIGHT?

18:44.754 --> 18:46.226
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME,

18:46.226 --> 18:47.797
BUT I KNOW SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT.

18:47.797 --> 18:49.529
I WAS JUST HOPING THAT
MAYBE YOU WOULD SPEAK WITH HER.

18:49.529 --> 18:53.663
YOU REALLY REFUSE TO ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY, DON'T YOU?

18:53.663 --> 18:55.335
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

18:56.806 --> 19:00.240
TELL ME, WHEN EXACTLY
DID PUNISHING THE GUILTY

19:00.240 --> 19:02.572
BECOME MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU
THAN HELPING THE INNOCENT?

19:12.782 --> 19:16.486
(man speaking indistinctly)

19:18.858 --> 19:21.831
(horns honking in distance)

19:21.831 --> 19:23.293
I GOTTA TELL YA,

19:23.293 --> 19:24.894
I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR
THAT FONTANA'S "MONSOON #2"

19:24.894 --> 19:26.266
WAS ON THE BLOCK.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.469
PATRICK.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.801
NOW WHY ARE YOU OFFERING THIS
UP TO THESE VULTURES, HUH?

19:31.801 --> 19:34.574
I MEAN, YOU LOVE THIS PIECE.
 YES, I DO.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.346
BUT THE TRUTH IS WE'RE,
UM...

19:36.346 --> 19:38.508
WE'RE HAVING
FINANCIAL TROUBLES.

19:38.508 --> 19:40.280
AND NOW THAT CONRAD'S HAD
TO STEP DOWN FROM OFFICE...

19:40.280 --> 19:42.482
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
SOMETHING?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.314
YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ME
SHALLOW,

19:44.314 --> 19:45.815
BUT THE WORLD I LIVE IN,

19:45.815 --> 19:47.617
IF THEY SENSE
THIS VULNERABILITY,

19:47.617 --> 19:49.919
THEY WILL USE IT
AS A WEAPON.

19:49.919 --> 19:53.723
SO... I PART
WITH THE THINGS I LOVE.

19:53.723 --> 19:56.396
STILL NOT AN EASY SACRIFICE
TO MAKE, RIGHT?

19:56.396 --> 20:00.300
IT'S EASIER
THAN SOME OTHERS.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.671
WELL, QUITE FRANKLY,

20:01.671 --> 20:03.833
THE FINAL CHANCE TO SEE
THIS PIECE

20:03.833 --> 20:05.405
IS NOT WHY I CAME BY.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.477
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I CHOSE THE FONTANA--

20:07.477 --> 20:10.610
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D COME.
 (chuckles)

20:10.610 --> 20:12.242
NEVER DOUBT THOSE
INSTINCTS OF YOURS.

20:12.242 --> 20:13.613
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE ALWAYS SPOT ON.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.415
I KNOW THAT MY DAUGHTER
CAME TO SEE YOU,

20:15.415 --> 20:16.886
AND IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT HER.

20:16.886 --> 20:19.349
AND IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT YOU
 FOR PROTECTING HER.

20:19.349 --> 20:21.921
IT'S OKAY.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.453
FAMILY'S COMPLICATED.

20:23.453 --> 20:25.895
BUT MY FEELINGS FOR YOU
ARE SIMPLE.

20:25.895 --> 20:27.927
AND I AM NEVER GOING
TO LET ANOTHER DAY PASS

20:27.927 --> 20:28.928
WITHOUT YOU IN IT.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.732
(horns honking,
siren wailing in distance)

20:32.732 --> 20:35.635
(beeps, auto-dials)

20:35.635 --> 20:37.707
(line rings, click)

20:37.707 --> 20:38.968
This is Father Paul.

20:38.968 --> 20:41.541
(breathy, lowered voice)
FATHER, I NEED YOUR HELP.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.373
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

20:43.373 --> 20:44.814
(knock on door)
 HELLO?

20:44.814 --> 20:45.815
(door creaks)

20:45.815 --> 20:47.747
FATHER PAUL WHITLEY.

20:49.519 --> 20:50.650
ARE YOU HERE?

20:50.650 --> 20:51.981
(grunts)

20:54.384 --> 20:56.686
(thuds)

20:56.686 --> 20:58.788
(man) A PLEASURE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU, MS. LeMARCHAL.

20:58.788 --> 21:00.930
OH, ALL MINE, MR. JOHNSON.

21:00.930 --> 21:02.031
RICHARD, PLEASE.

21:02.031 --> 21:03.933
BONSOIR, MADEMOISELLE.
 (kisses)

21:03.933 --> 21:05.995
ET MONSIEUR.
 THANKS, RICHARD.
APPRECIATE IT.

21:05.995 --> 21:08.037
THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.

21:08.037 --> 21:09.939
(elevator bell dings,
doors close)

21:09.939 --> 21:12.872
OKAY, FIRST YOU FIND ME
ENOUGH INVESTORS

21:12.872 --> 21:15.705
THAT I CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD
A NICE OFFICE SPACE.

21:15.705 --> 21:17.847
THEN GET THE MAN
WHO MADE "PAGE SIX"

21:17.847 --> 21:20.049
INTERESTED IN WORKING
WITH US...

21:20.049 --> 21:22.512
IN THE COURSE OF ONE DAY.

21:22.512 --> 21:24.514
SO WHEN DO I START?

21:24.514 --> 21:26.416
I DON'T REMEMBER
OFFERING YOU THE JOB.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.918
OH, BUT YOU WERE ABOUT TO.

21:31.861 --> 21:33.893
WOW.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.896
WHAT'S THE REASON WE'RE NOT
STAYING IN THESE OFFICES?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.768
MY FATHER'S NAME
IS ON THE BUILDING.

21:38.768 --> 21:42.332
AND HE MADE IT CLEAR
MY PRESENCE HERE IS TEMPORARY.

21:42.332 --> 21:45.435
TOO BAD. I COULD GET USED
TO A VIEW LIKE THIS.

21:45.435 --> 21:47.577
THIS CALLS FOR CELEBRATION.
 I CAN'T.

21:47.577 --> 21:49.078
I'VE BEEN SUMMONED
TO SOUTHAMPTON TONIGHT.

21:49.078 --> 21:52.081
HMM. YOU STILL HAVE
A LITTLE TIME.

21:56.846 --> 21:58.918
(buttons pop)

22:13.863 --> 22:14.904
(doorbell rings)

22:22.842 --> 22:24.944
COME TO BORROW
A CUP OF VINEGAR?

22:24.944 --> 22:26.676
NO, I WANTED
TO DROP THESE OFF

22:26.676 --> 22:28.347
AND WELCOME YOU
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.079
(chuckles)

22:30.079 --> 22:31.881
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO TALK THE OTHER DAY

22:31.881 --> 22:34.824
AFTER THAT LITTLE STUNT
OF YOURS.

22:34.824 --> 22:38.828
WELL, I COULDN'T WAIT
TO BE SURROUNDED BY

22:38.828 --> 22:41.391
NOTHING BUT AIR
AFTER HAVING BEEN LOCKED UP

22:41.391 --> 22:43.633
FOR SIX MONTHS.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.665
AND AFTER YOUR RECENT
LEGAL ISSUES,

22:45.665 --> 22:48.898
HOW FORTUNATE YOU WERE ABLE
TO PURCHASE THIS PLACE.

22:48.898 --> 22:51.901
I KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
TO THAW FROZEN ASSETS.

22:51.901 --> 22:55.104
IN FACT, I'M CERTAIN SOMEONE
WITH YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL PROWESS

22:55.104 --> 22:57.947
WOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE
ACCESSING BANK ACCOUNTS,

22:57.947 --> 22:59.849
WHETHER THEY BELONG TO YOU
OR NOT.

22:59.849 --> 23:03.112
ALTHOUGH I LOVE
A GOOD SHOWER OF PRAISE,

23:03.112 --> 23:05.815
VICTORIA, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

23:05.815 --> 23:08.818
BUT, UH, MY LIFE IS
A COMPUTER-FREE ZONE THESE DAYS.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.823
OH, I SEE YOU'VE MADE ROOM
FOR OTHER THINGS.

23:17.497 --> 23:21.801
NOW WHAT COULD HAVE MADE YOU
PART WITH SUCH A MASTERPIECE?

23:21.801 --> 23:25.505
AND WHO KNEW YOU TO BE
SUCH AN ART CONNOISSEUR?

23:25.505 --> 23:28.007
WELL, I... DABBLE.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.809
IN MANY THINGS, NO DOUBT.

23:30.780 --> 23:33.412
SOME, QUITE POSSIBLY,
UNFORGIVABLE.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.618
I SHOULD LEAVE YOU
TO GET SETTLED.

23:41.050 --> 23:44.994
(light jazz music playing)

23:44.994 --> 23:46.926
(alcohol pouring)

23:46.926 --> 23:49.459
CHARLOTTE.

23:49.459 --> 23:51.130
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.032
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

23:53.032 --> 23:57.667
IT'S FINE. LET'S JUST ENJOY
DINNER, SHALL WE?

23:59.609 --> 24:02.812
(sighs) YOUR MEETINGS
MUST HAVE WENT WELL.
 YEAH.

24:02.812 --> 24:04.714
I WAITED FOR YOU AT THE HOUSE,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LATE.
 (ice cubes rattle and clink)

24:04.714 --> 24:05.915
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THE TRAFFIC'S LIKE

24:05.915 --> 24:07.046
GETTING OUT OF THE CITY.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.619
(ice cubes rattle,
bottle clanks)

24:09.619 --> 24:11.951
SO... WAS MARGAUX INTERESTED?
 (alcohol pouring)

24:11.951 --> 24:14.453
SHE MADE AN OFFER.
I TOLD HER I'D SLEEP ON IT.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.686
A JOB WITH
A MONTHLY PUBLICATION?

24:16.686 --> 24:18.888
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT
A LITTLE STABILITY.

24:18.888 --> 24:22.031
(chuckles) JUST WORRY ABOUT
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

24:22.031 --> 24:24.163
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
ECHOING THE UNIVERSAL SENTIMENT

24:24.163 --> 24:28.097
THAT HUNTINGTON'S SHOULD
OCCUPY 100% OF MY THOUGHTS.
 (ice cubes rattle)

24:28.097 --> 24:31.100
(clatters)
 OR MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S EVERYONE'S ELOQUENT WAY

24:31.100 --> 24:33.743
OF NOT HAVING
TO HEED MY OPINIONS.

24:33.743 --> 24:36.506
WELL, I'D LIKE TO KNOW
HOW YOU'RE FEELING, DAD.

24:36.506 --> 24:38.848
(exhales) PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME, SWEETHEART. THANK YOU.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.711
ANY IDEA WHY YOUR MOTHER

24:41.711 --> 24:43.783
HAS CALLED THIS
DE FACTO FAMILY SUMMIT?

24:43.783 --> 24:46.055
TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOMEONE SPECIAL.

24:46.055 --> 24:48.187
(Daniel) WHO'S THIS?

24:48.187 --> 24:49.759
OUR BROTHER.

24:55.525 --> 24:57.827
(rattling)

25:18.848 --> 25:22.852
(objects rustling)

25:25.895 --> 25:28.698
(closes desk lid)

25:28.698 --> 25:32.201
I GOTTA SAY I DO MISS
THE FONTANA IN THE STAIRWELL.

25:32.201 --> 25:34.964
OH, WOW.
WELL-VERSED IN MODERNISTS

25:34.964 --> 25:37.567
AND WELL-ACQUAINTED
WITH MY HOME.

25:37.567 --> 25:40.039
YOU ARE JUST FULL OF SURPRISES,
MR. OSBOURNE.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.572
HE WAS LIVING HERE.
 OF COURSE HE WAS.

25:42.572 --> 25:44.543
(silverware clinks)
 SO NO JOB?

25:44.543 --> 25:46.946
WELL, PATRICK
IS A FREELANCE ARTIST.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.278
OH, FREELANCING'S NOT
A PROFESSION, DEAR.

25:49.278 --> 25:52.051
IT'S A HOBBY ONE HAS
BETWEEN BARTENDING SHIFTS.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.252
AND I COULD USE ANOTHER DRINK.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.553
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH--
 I'LL GET IT.

25:56.956 --> 26:00.730
YOU KNOW, AFTER "NIGHTLINE,"
LETTERS POURED IN FROM LEECHES

26:00.730 --> 26:02.031
CLAIMING TO BE HER SON.

26:02.031 --> 26:04.263
HOW DO WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THEM?

26:04.263 --> 26:07.897
I HAVE THE, UH...

26:07.897 --> 26:09.098
I COULD HAVE SWOR--
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

26:09.098 --> 26:10.770
I LEFT THE D.N.A. TEST
IN MY OTHER JACKET.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.242
(chuckles) HE'S FUNNY.
WELL...

26:13.242 --> 26:15.004
DON'T THINK YOU'VE HIT
THE JACKPOT, BUDDY,

26:15.004 --> 26:16.946
'CAUSE WE'RE BROKE.

26:16.946 --> 26:19.749
PATRICK IS APPRISED
OF OUR SITUATION.

26:19.749 --> 26:22.111
AND AS DIFFICULT AS IT MAY BE
FOR ANY OF YOU TO BELIEVE,

26:22.111 --> 26:25.114
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE DRIVEN BY
MOTIVATIONS OTHER THAN

26:25.114 --> 26:26.986
FINANCIAL GAIN.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.058
YOU KNOW, PERHAPS PATRICK
CAN FLOAT US A LOAN

26:29.058 --> 26:30.890
FROM WHAT'S LEFT
OF THE $5 MILLION.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.222
I MEAN, THAT IS HOW YOU
SUSTAIN A LIFE, UH,

26:33.222 --> 26:35.795
THANK YOU, UH,
FREELANCING, I IMAGINE.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.296
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 (mouth full) MM.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.729
(swallows) WHEN PATRICK HERE
WAS OF AGE,

26:39.729 --> 26:41.130
HE CAME AND SEARCHED
FOR HIS MOTHER.

26:41.130 --> 26:44.133
AND OUR GENERAL FACTOTUM,
FRANK, PAID HIM THAT TIDY SUM

26:44.133 --> 26:46.676
TO... DISAPPEAR.

26:46.676 --> 26:48.207
(whispers) WOW.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.338
(normal voice)
THE GUY'S NAME WAS FRANK?

26:49.338 --> 26:50.940
MM.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.082
WELL, FRANK SHOWED UP...

26:53.082 --> 26:54.283
BUT HE ONLY THREATENED
TO HURT ME.

26:54.283 --> 26:57.086
I NEVER SAW A CENT
OF THAT MONEY.

26:57.086 --> 26:58.788
AND NO OFFENSE, MR. GRAYSON,

26:58.788 --> 27:00.019
BUT MY ONLY FEAR COMING
INTO TONIGHT WAS THAT

27:00.019 --> 27:01.791
YOU'D TRY TO SIC HIM
ON ME AGAIN.

27:01.791 --> 27:06.996
(chuckles) THEN I HAVE TWO
HAPPY PIECES OF NEWS TO SHARE.

27:06.996 --> 27:09.258
FIRST OFF,
POOR FRANK IS DECEASED.

27:09.258 --> 27:11.831
AND I WASN'T THE ONE
WHO SENT HIM.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.963
THAT'D BE
YOUR DEAR OLD MUM.

27:17.206 --> 27:18.708
YOU DID THAT?

27:18.708 --> 27:21.010
IT'S TRUE.

27:24.413 --> 27:26.645
EXCUSE ME.
 NO! WAIT.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.347
WHEN YOU CAME
LOOKING FOR ME,

27:28.347 --> 27:31.250
I SUDDENLY BECAME THAT
SCARED TEENAGE GIRL AGAIN.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.954
AND I MADE THE SAME MISTAKE.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.886
AND I'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN

27:36.886 --> 27:38.828
TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT
I'VE BEEN MISSING.

27:38.828 --> 27:43.292
AND I SWEAR TO YOU
THAT I WILL GO TO MY GRAVE

27:43.292 --> 27:44.864
TO TRY TO ATONE
FOR THOSE SINS.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.700
NOW...

27:50.700 --> 27:52.842
PATRICK HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG.

27:52.842 --> 27:54.904
AND FOR YOU TO TREAT HIM
LIKE THIS

27:54.904 --> 27:57.276
IS NOT ONLY UNWARRANTED--
IT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

27:57.276 --> 28:01.851
HE IS GOOD,
AND HE IS GENUINE.

28:01.851 --> 28:04.884
AND I WILL BE DAMNED
IF I SIT HERE

28:04.884 --> 28:07.717
AND LET YOU DRAG HIM
DOWN TO YOUR LEVEL.

28:07.717 --> 28:11.190
HE IS MY SON,
AND THAT MAKES HIM FAMILY.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.823
WELL, THEN, HERE'S...

28:13.823 --> 28:17.026
(Emily)
CONRAD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
 (grunts)

28:17.026 --> 28:19.368
AAH! DAMN IT!
 (Charlotte gasps)

28:20.429 --> 28:22.031
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
MOTHER.
 (grunts)

28:22.031 --> 28:24.233
GOD, HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SELFISH?

28:24.233 --> 28:26.705
SPRINGING PATRICK ON US
AND RILING DAD UP.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.938
HE'S SICK, AND YOU COULD
CARE LESS.
 CHARLOTTE--

28:28.938 --> 28:31.710
PATRICK, IF I WERE YOU, I'D GET
OUT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

28:40.119 --> 28:43.292
(waves crashing,
chimes tinkling)

28:43.292 --> 28:46.295
(sea birds calling)

28:52.762 --> 28:53.933
HEY.

28:56.766 --> 28:58.737
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
MY MOTHER CHOSE

28:58.737 --> 29:01.410
TO TROT PATRICK OUT
YESTERDAY.

29:01.410 --> 29:04.944
WELL, I'M SURE
SHE HAD HER REASONS.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.816
WHY DO I EVEN CARE?

29:06.816 --> 29:08.918
MY PARENTS ARE
ROTTEN HUMAN BEINGS

29:08.918 --> 29:10.279
WHO CONTINUALLY
DISAPPOINT ME.

29:10.279 --> 29:13.352
AND YET I HAVE THIS
INNATE NEED TO PROTECT THEM.

29:13.352 --> 29:16.285
BECAUSE DESPITE EVERYTHING,
THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY.

29:16.285 --> 29:19.388
MM.
 AND WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG
AND THREATENS THAT BOND,

29:19.388 --> 29:21.861
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING
TO DEFEND IT.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.296
IS THAT WHY YOU HAVEN'T
MENTIONED THE JOB--

29:27.296 --> 29:31.470
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE CITY?
 THE JOB?

29:31.470 --> 29:34.173
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT, DANIEL.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.845
I'LL BE HERE TO MAKE SURE
THAT PATRICK

29:35.845 --> 29:37.406
DOESN'T INTERFERE TOO MUCH,
AND BESIDES,

29:37.406 --> 29:39.178
I'M SURE MARGAUX
IS COUNTING ON YOU.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.510
SHE CAN HANDLE HERSELF,
BELIEVE ME.

29:41.510 --> 29:45.955
I'M JUST--I'M JUST NOT SURE
IT'S FOR ME.

29:45.955 --> 29:47.416
WELL, I'LL LEAVE IT
UP TO YOU,

29:47.416 --> 29:50.920
BUT JUST CONSIDER IT,
OKAY?
 OKAY.

29:53.362 --> 29:55.564
(whispers)
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

30:03.933 --> 30:05.835
(birds chirping,
man speaking indistinctly)

30:13.242 --> 30:14.583
MORNING, PATRICK.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.415
EMILY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:16.415 --> 30:18.587
WELL, I HAD A MEETING
WITH MY WEDDING PLANNER,

30:18.587 --> 30:20.019
AND SHE CANCELED
LAST MINUTE.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.550
THEN I REMEMBERED
THAT YOU WERE STAYING HERE.

30:21.550 --> 30:22.952
I KNOW THAT IF I WERE YOU,

30:22.952 --> 30:24.593
I'D WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY
AFTER LAST NIGHT.

30:24.593 --> 30:27.256
THE GRAYSONS CAN BE
QUITE A HANDFUL.

30:27.256 --> 30:28.998
(chuckles)

30:28.998 --> 30:30.459
I'M WELL AWARE OF YOUR HISTORY
WITH MY MOTHER

30:30.459 --> 30:32.831
AND HER FAMILY. SO...

30:32.831 --> 30:34.263
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

30:39.108 --> 30:43.042
(Carl crying)
 PLEASE... HEY! CARL.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.874
HEY! CARL!
 HEY.

30:44.874 --> 30:46.475
(sighs)
 IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S IN A MOOD.

30:46.475 --> 30:48.847
(continues crying)
 HE'S BEEN FUSSY
ALL AFTERNOON.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.219
I TRIED TO FEED HIM,
I GAVE HIM A TOY,

30:50.219 --> 30:51.881
I EVEN TRIED
THE WEDDING VIDEO.
 COME HERE, COME HERE.

30:51.881 --> 30:55.885
NOTHING I DID
WAS GOOD ENOUGH.
 OH, BUDDY.

30:55.885 --> 30:59.028
HE'S JUST TIRED.
HE'S JUST TIRED.

30:59.028 --> 31:00.459
YEAH, TIRED OF HIS AUNTIE.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.431
(Carl continues crying)

31:02.431 --> 31:04.033
CLEARLY I'M NOT FIT
FOR MOTHERHOOD.

31:04.033 --> 31:06.435
WHAT?

31:06.435 --> 31:08.968
YOU'RE BEING
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.469
NO, I'M NOT.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.641
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE,
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINKING

31:12.641 --> 31:17.076
IT'S THE UNIVERSE'S WAY
OF PAYING ME BACK.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.647
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:23.052 --> 31:26.555
IF I HAD JUST TOLD DECLAN
WHERE I WAS INSTEAD OF LYING,

31:26.555 --> 31:28.617
HE WOULDN'T HAVE COME LOOKING
FOR ME AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

31:28.617 --> 31:31.961
HIS DEATH IS ALL MY FAULT.

31:31.961 --> 31:33.963
CHARLOTTE...

31:33.963 --> 31:35.995
YOU'VE BEEN BLAMING YOURSELF
THIS WHOLE TIME?

31:35.995 --> 31:37.566
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH--
 JACK, DON'T.

31:38.968 --> 31:42.001
I DON'T DESERVE YOUR PITY.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.973
I'M THE REASON
YOUR BROTHER'S GONE.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.478
CHARLOTTE, WAIT.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.983
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

31:53.983 --> 31:56.946
SO YOUR INSTINCTS
ABOUT TURNING PATRICK

31:56.946 --> 31:58.487
WERE A LITTLE OFF.

31:58.487 --> 32:00.289
KINDA MAKES YOU WANT
TO RECONSIDER

32:00.289 --> 32:01.951
TAKING DOWN FATHER PAUL,
DOESN'T IT?

32:01.951 --> 32:03.392
(sighs) TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME HERE

32:03.392 --> 32:05.054
TO TALK ME OUT OF IT.

32:05.054 --> 32:09.628
JUST FINISHING A LITTLE
HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECT.
 (whirs)

32:11.400 --> 32:12.531
NICE, NOLAN.

32:12.531 --> 32:16.665
AND... THAT'S NOT ALL.
 (box clatters)

32:16.665 --> 32:20.009
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:22.611 --> 32:24.643
(sighs)

32:24.643 --> 32:27.716
"ALL I ASK
IS THAT YOU PROMISE TO DO

32:27.716 --> 32:29.718
"THE ONE THING
THAT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO DO."

32:29.718 --> 32:31.580
NOLAN.
 "FORGIVE.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.983
"KEEPING HATE FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO BETRAYED ME

32:33.983 --> 32:35.684
"HAS BROUGHT NOTHING
BUT TORMENT AND HEARTACHE.

32:35.684 --> 32:38.257
YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT,
AMANDA. YOU DESERVE LOVE."

32:38.257 --> 32:39.628
DON'T YOU EVER GO THROUGH
MY THINGS AGAIN.

32:39.628 --> 32:40.689
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

32:40.689 --> 32:42.231
I BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS

32:42.231 --> 32:44.333
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU LOVED MY FATHER.

32:44.333 --> 32:47.036
I DO LOVE HIM,
AND I LOVE HIS DAUGHTER.

32:47.036 --> 32:50.199
AND I WANT TO PROTECT HER.
 I DON'T NEED
YOUR PROTECTION, NOLAN.

32:50.199 --> 32:55.044
WHA--CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, EMS.
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T THINK

32:55.044 --> 32:56.705
YOU WERE GONNA TELL JACK
THE TRUTH...
 (slams box lid)

32:56.705 --> 32:58.677
UNTIL THIS WAS ALL OVER.
BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.550
SO MAYBE--MAYBE
THE BEST-LAID PLANS

33:01.550 --> 33:03.452
ARE SOMETIMES MEANT
TO BE ABANDONED!

33:03.452 --> 33:05.014
MAYBE THEY'RE MEANT TO BE
CARRIED OUT ALONE.

33:06.355 --> 33:08.317
(jingles)

33:08.317 --> 33:10.559
(footsteps depart)

33:10.559 --> 33:12.261
(door opens)

33:12.261 --> 33:14.323
(curtain rings rattle)

33:17.326 --> 33:18.997
OH, THERE'S MY GIRL.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.500
I AM NOT YOUR GIRL.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.272
YOU KNOW, DESPITE
ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS

33:23.272 --> 33:25.274
I HEARD ABOUT FLIGHT 197

33:25.274 --> 33:28.006
AND WHAT YOU DID
TO MY ACTUAL FATHER,

33:28.006 --> 33:31.340
I HOPED IT WASN'T TRUE,
THAT YOU COULDN'T BE THAT EVIL.

33:31.340 --> 33:34.213
UH, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

33:34.213 --> 33:37.646
(voice breaking) YOU KNEW ABOUT
THE BOMB THAT KILLED DECLAN.

33:39.488 --> 33:41.050
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

33:41.050 --> 33:44.653
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW GUILTY
I FEEL OVER HIS DEATH?

33:44.653 --> 33:48.257
FROM THE MOMENT IT HAPPENED,
I BLAMED MYSELF.

33:48.257 --> 33:52.030
IT MADE ME SICK, AND I KNOW
THAT'S WHY I MISCARRIED.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.064
OH, CHARLOTTE, SWEETHEART,
THAT--
 YOU WATCHED ME SUFFER,

33:55.064 --> 33:57.536
WHILE YOU SAT ON YOUR THRONE
IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.669
I'M DONE HELPING YOU.

34:00.669 --> 34:02.811
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS.

34:02.811 --> 34:08.516
YOU DESERVE TO DIE
MISERABLE AND ALONE.

34:19.428 --> 34:21.590
(Father Paul)
"OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN,

34:21.590 --> 34:24.393
"HALLOWED BE THY NAME.

34:24.393 --> 34:26.395
"THEY KINGDOM COME,
THY WILL BE DONE,

34:26.395 --> 34:29.138
"ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

34:29.138 --> 34:31.670
"GIVE US THIS DAY
OUR DAILY BREAD,

34:31.670 --> 34:34.303
"AND FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES

34:34.303 --> 34:37.806
"AS WE FORGIVE THOSE
WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US.

34:37.806 --> 34:40.748
"AND LEAD US NOT
INTO TEMPTATION,

34:40.748 --> 34:43.312
"BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL.

34:43.312 --> 34:45.654
"FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM
AND THE POWER AND THE GLORY,

34:45.654 --> 34:48.317
FOREVER. AMEN."

34:48.317 --> 34:51.760
(congregation) AMEN.
 AMEN.

34:56.625 --> 34:57.796
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

34:57.796 --> 34:59.828
SOMEONE CRACKED ME
OVER THE HEAD.

34:59.828 --> 35:01.830
AND I WAKE UP AN HOUR LATER
WITH AN EMPTY WALLET

35:01.830 --> 35:03.472
AND A KILLER HEADACHE.

35:03.472 --> 35:05.534
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
WHAT DID THE POLICE SAY?

35:05.534 --> 35:06.805
OH, I DIDN'T CALL THEM.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.308
WHOEVER DID IT NEEDED
WHAT I HAD MORE THAN I DID.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.539
LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR WEDDING.

35:10.539 --> 35:12.811
WELL, I...

35:12.811 --> 35:14.613
I HEAR YOU SAW
MY FUTURE IN-LAWS.

35:14.613 --> 35:18.247
I DID... UNTIL CONRAD
PRACTICALLY THREW ME OUT.

35:18.247 --> 35:21.119
I ONLY HOPE HE HEARD A LITTLE
OF WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.292
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY WOULDN'T HE?

35:23.292 --> 35:25.724
IN TRUTH,

35:25.724 --> 35:29.698
THE MISTAKES THAT WE MADE--
IN LARGE PART--

35:29.698 --> 35:32.601
ARE WHY I CHANGED MY LIFE

35:32.601 --> 35:34.533
AND TRY TO CHANGE THOSE
OF OTHERS.

35:34.533 --> 35:38.367
HOPEFULLY, I'LL MAKE
A BETTER IMPRESSION

35:38.367 --> 35:39.768
ON YOUR PARENTS, EMILY.

35:39.768 --> 35:42.911
(chuckles) UM...

35:42.911 --> 35:44.613
I LOST MY PARENTS
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

35:44.613 --> 35:48.647
I'M SORRY. IT MUST BE
DIFFICULT PLANNING A WEDDING

35:48.647 --> 35:49.818
KNOWING THAT YOUR FATHER
WON'T BE THERE

35:49.818 --> 35:51.850
TO WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.485
YEAH.
 IF HE WERE STILL HERE,

35:56.485 --> 36:00.929
I KNOW THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD
OF THE WOMAN THAT YOU'VE BECOME,

36:00.929 --> 36:02.561
AND GETTING
ALL THE HAPPINESS

36:02.561 --> 36:04.863
THAT HE MUST HAVE
WANTED FOR YOU.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.196
(whispers)
I'M SORRY, FATHER.

36:07.196 --> 36:08.767
WELL, IT'S--
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.270
WHEN ONE LOSES A PARENT
AT A YOUNG AGE,

36:11.270 --> 36:14.443
THEY MISS OUT ON A WHOLE
LIFETIME OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

36:14.443 --> 36:16.705
LUCKY FOR YOU,

36:16.705 --> 36:20.479
I KNOW WHERE YOU CAN FIND
A LITTLE EXTRA.

36:22.711 --> 36:25.614
(knock on door)
 HMM?

36:25.614 --> 36:26.715
(indistinct conversations)

36:26.715 --> 36:28.557
HEY.
 DANIEL.

36:28.557 --> 36:31.760
(telephone ringing in distance)
 LOOK, UH, ABOUT YESTERDAY...

36:31.760 --> 36:32.821
I'M SORRY.

36:32.821 --> 36:35.924
OBVIOUSLY, I WAS MISTAKEN.

36:35.924 --> 36:38.467
THE OLD DANIEL
WOULDN'T HAVE HESITATED.

36:38.467 --> 36:39.668
NOW THE NEW DANIEL

36:39.668 --> 36:42.200
PICKS UP MY DRESS
AND HANDS IT TO ME.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.673
THAT'S A FIRST.

36:44.673 --> 36:46.675
AND I ASSUME HE ALSO HAS
THE CLASS

36:46.675 --> 36:48.707
TO DECLINE A JOB IN PERSON?

36:51.410 --> 36:53.712
LET ME CHOOSE
THE "VOULEZ" OFFICE LOCATION,

36:53.712 --> 36:54.713
AND I'LL TAKE THE JOB.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.645
THAT'S IT?
 THAT'S IT.

36:56.645 --> 36:59.248
WELL, YOU'D BE
DOING ME A FAVOR.

36:59.248 --> 37:00.689
WHERE DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

37:00.689 --> 37:02.851
MONTAUK.

37:02.851 --> 37:05.294
YOU WANT TO MAKE A SPLASH,
WE GOTTA BE TRAILBLAZERS.

37:05.294 --> 37:06.925
PLUS I HAVE
SOME HOLDINGS THERE

37:06.925 --> 37:08.857
COMPLETELY RENT-FREE
AND READY FOR REHAB.

37:08.857 --> 37:11.530
AND IT ALLOWS YOU
TO BE CLOSE TO YOUR FIANCéE?

37:11.530 --> 37:14.002
IT DOES LET ME BE NEARER
TO MY FAMILY, YEAH.

37:14.002 --> 37:16.805
AND ALL THE POWER PLAYERS
WE WANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH--

37:16.805 --> 37:18.337
THAT'S WHERE THEY SUMMER,
TOO.

37:19.708 --> 37:23.772
THIS NEW DANIEL GRAYSON
DRIVES A HARD BARGAIN.

37:25.274 --> 37:27.646
EXACTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
IN A PUBLISHER.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.982
I STARTED COLLECTING FOOD
FOR THE HOMELESS ON HOLIDAYS...

37:33.982 --> 37:37.456
HEY, HOW YOU DOING, FATHER?
 WHEN I FIRST CAME
TO THE PARISH, BUT...

37:37.456 --> 37:39.428
(man) FATHER PAUL.
 HEY!

37:39.428 --> 37:43.261
NOW IT'S JUST GROWN
EXPONENTIALLY.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.963
I'M HOPING WHEN
I BECOME PASTOR,

37:44.963 --> 37:47.536
I'LL FIND A BIGGER PLACE,
FEED MORE PEOPLE.
 (indistinct conversations)

37:47.536 --> 37:49.898
OH, CHRISTINA!

37:49.898 --> 37:51.600
OH, MY GOODNESS.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.473
(Christina speaks indistinctly)
 JUST...

37:54.473 --> 37:57.576
HERE YOU GO. THANKS.
 (boy) SO COOL!

37:57.576 --> 37:59.778
(speaking indistinctly)

37:59.778 --> 38:03.612
OVERWHELMING, ISN'T IT?

38:03.612 --> 38:05.384
YEAH, IT IS.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.555
THANK YOU, FATHER.

38:07.816 --> 38:11.760
EXCUSE ME. THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO GO DO.

38:21.930 --> 38:23.572
PASTOR, HOW ARE YOU?

38:23.572 --> 38:25.734
NOT GOOD, PAUL.
WE NEED TO TALK.

38:35.514 --> 38:39.748
(Paul) I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.991
AIDEN?

38:49.958 --> 38:52.361
CHECKING UP ON MY STORY
ABOUT NOLAN ROSS, WERE YOU?

38:52.361 --> 38:55.033
DON'T GO BEHIND MY BACK.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.466
I WON'T HAVE YOU
JEOPARDIZE MY PLANS.

38:57.466 --> 39:00.639
UNTIL YOU EARN MY TRUST,
MR. MATHIS,

39:00.639 --> 39:02.841
I WILL TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.574
NOW AS I SUSPECTED,

39:05.574 --> 39:07.676
NOLAN IS CLEARLY
HIDING SOMETHING.

39:07.676 --> 39:11.079
HE'S MERELY A PAWN...

39:11.079 --> 39:12.451
LIKE I WAS.

39:12.451 --> 39:16.685
THE DEED... TO NOLAN'S HOUSE...

39:16.685 --> 39:19.558
WITH EMILY'S NAME ON IT.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.359
SHE HAS YOUR FORTUNE.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.493
WHAT NOW?

39:24.493 --> 39:27.766
NOW YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.745
(whispers) I'M SORRY, DAD.

39:43.712 --> 39:45.684
(doors close)

39:45.684 --> 39:47.155
CONRAD?

39:47.155 --> 39:50.759
(chuckles) EMILY.

39:50.759 --> 39:53.522
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TRUE
WHAT THEY SAY--

39:53.522 --> 39:55.093
"A BRIDE'S WORK
IS NEVER DONE."

39:57.566 --> 39:59.698
I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN A SANCTUARY LIKE THIS

39:59.698 --> 40:02.771
SINCE I WAS AN ALTAR BOY.

40:02.771 --> 40:04.402
ARE YOU HERE
TO SEE FATHER PAUL?

40:04.402 --> 40:06.034
NO, NO.

40:06.034 --> 40:07.436
WHY DO YOU ASK?

40:07.436 --> 40:09.908
OH, UH...

40:09.908 --> 40:11.980
HE AND I GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT YESTERDAY.

40:11.980 --> 40:14.613
WELL, I... GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT YESTERDAY

40:14.613 --> 40:17.646
WITH HIM, WITH PATRICK...

40:17.646 --> 40:20.619
OTHERS I CARE ABOUT.

40:20.619 --> 40:21.850
DO YOU KNOW
IF HE'S IN HIS OFFICE?

40:21.850 --> 40:25.153
I'M AFRAID HE'S GONE.

40:25.153 --> 40:26.855
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

40:26.855 --> 40:28.697
HE LEFT ST. FRANCIS.

40:28.697 --> 40:31.730
OH.

40:31.730 --> 40:32.661
(chuckles)

40:36.465 --> 40:39.508
(chuckles) YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS DEEMED KARMA

40:39.508 --> 40:41.109
A CONCEPT CREATED
TO LIFT THE SPIRITS

40:41.109 --> 40:42.771
OF THE UNACCOMPLISHED,

40:42.771 --> 40:45.674
BUT RECENT EVENTS
HAVE GIVEN ME PAUSE.

40:48.677 --> 40:52.951
I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN
THE NATURAL BALANCE OF THINGS.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.524
WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.

40:55.524 --> 40:58.186
THEN HARVEST MAY BE
UPON ME, MISS THORNE.

40:58.186 --> 41:00.689
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FACE
THE PUNISHMENT FOR MY SINS.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.836
I'M SORRY. PLEASE EXCUSE
MY SENSELESS PRATTLE.

41:07.836 --> 41:12.040
I SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED
PAUL'S EAR

41:12.040 --> 41:13.772
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.545
ISN'T THERE ANYONE ELSE
YOU COULD TALK TO?

41:18.476 --> 41:21.750
I FEAR I HAVE NO ONE LEFT
TO LISTEN.

41:24.913 --> 41:29.718
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD
TAKE THAT, TOO, AS A SIGN.

41:29.718 --> 41:31.760
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, EMILY.

41:38.627 --> 41:39.798
(doors close)

41:48.036 --> 41:49.507
(beep)

41:49.507 --> 41:51.209
COME FOR THIS?
 (whirs)

41:51.209 --> 41:52.541
NO.

41:53.742 --> 41:55.614
YOU WERE RIGHT.
 (jingles)

41:55.614 --> 41:57.746
(key clatters)

42:01.089 --> 42:04.522
I KNEW YOU HADN'T GONE
FULL DARK SIDE. SO...

42:04.522 --> 42:05.754
YOU STOPPED THE TAKEDOWN?

42:05.754 --> 42:08.126
I TRIED.
IT WAS TOO LATE.

42:10.759 --> 42:12.561
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

42:12.561 --> 42:13.762
FIX IT.

42:13.762 --> 42:15.904
BECAUSE I THINK FATHER PAUL
CAN DO THE ONE THING

42:15.904 --> 42:17.305
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO.

42:18.737 --> 42:22.571
CONVINCE CONRAD TO CONFESS...

42:22.571 --> 42:24.142
TO EVERYTHING.
