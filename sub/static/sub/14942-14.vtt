Aah!

00:36.367 --> 00:38.037
(Police radio chatter)

00:38.038 --> 00:39.309
A dead body in a freezer, huh?

00:39.310 --> 00:41.411
Yep, male, mid 50s. Joe sanella.

00:41.412 --> 00:45.044
Owner/operator of
sanella's family restaurant.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.346
A Philly institution.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.118
Yeah, so was Joe.

00:48.119 --> 00:49.319
You knew him?

00:49.320 --> 00:51.121
Yeah, my parents used to
bring me here all the time

00:51.122 --> 00:52.182
as a kid.

00:52.183 --> 00:54.184
Joe used to like
to call me petey.

00:54.185 --> 00:57.087
(Laughs) So what's her story,

00:57.088 --> 00:58.288
petey.

00:58.289 --> 01:01.261
Ugh. Delia Cole, one
of sanella's employees.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.062
She shocked
herself on a live wire

01:03.063 --> 01:04.194
when she came in for her shift.

01:04.195 --> 01:06.196
She's the one who found Joe.

01:06.197 --> 01:09.068
(People speak indistinctly)

01:09.069 --> 01:10.270
(Camera shutter clicking,
people speaking indistinctly)

01:10.271 --> 01:13.273
This is where Delia
shocked herself.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.074
Is it related to the crime?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.206
Well, we'll know soon enough.

01:16.207 --> 01:19.109
All right. Check the
body for electrical burns.

01:19.110 --> 01:20.410
I hope you brought
a warm jacket.

01:20.411 --> 01:22.412
Haven't you heard?
I'm cold-blooded.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.454
(Chuckles)

01:24.455 --> 01:27.287
(Man) I'm sorry. Could
you hand me those?

01:27.288 --> 01:29.088
(Whirring)

01:29.089 --> 01:31.121
So leaving a body in a freezer...
What was the killer thinking?

01:31.122 --> 01:33.092
I mean, the cold
preserves the evidence.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.424
It makes our job easier.

01:34.425 --> 01:38.198
Actually, the damaged tissue
makes the internal exam harder.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.300
I'm just saying, not a genius.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.101
I got evidence...
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:42.102 --> 01:45.375
Of frostbite on the
cheeks, nose, and ears.

01:45.376 --> 01:49.279
Looks like his whole
body is frozen to the core.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.182
In this cold, that would
take a minimum of...

01:52.183 --> 01:54.384
(Sighs) 36 hours.

01:54.385 --> 01:56.246
So fetal position

01:56.247 --> 01:58.188
suggests that he was
alive at some point,

01:58.189 --> 01:59.249
trying to keep warm.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.292
Yeah, this purplish-red
blistering right there

02:02.293 --> 02:03.353
confirms it.

02:03.354 --> 02:05.225
If he was dropped
here when he was dead,

02:05.226 --> 02:06.396
you wouldn't see that coloring.

02:06.397 --> 02:07.497
So he must have been
knocked unconscious.

02:07.498 --> 02:09.199
I mean, otherwise, he
would've walked out.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.330
There's no lock on the door.

02:10.331 --> 02:13.132
Well, all this blood trickling
down his face confirms that,

02:13.133 --> 02:15.235
and I got blunt force
trauma to the head.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.368
Peter, take a museum's
worth of photos.

02:18.369 --> 02:21.271
Once a frozen body is
removed from the cold,

02:21.272 --> 02:23.273
it starts to decompose
very quickly.

02:23.274 --> 02:27.177
So right now is the best
chance we have to document this.

02:27.178 --> 02:29.449
Wh-where are you going?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.251
Find a hot chocolate.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.452
(Exhales)

02:32.453 --> 02:35.455
I didn't understand
the plight of the penguin

02:35.456 --> 02:37.257
until just now.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.428
Then work up a sweat.

02:38.429 --> 02:40.490
This is a balmy 38 degrees

02:40.491 --> 02:43.162
compared to the
restaurant freezer.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.294
Can we just lift the damn body?

02:44.295 --> 02:46.236
(Ethan) Okay, ready?
One. Two. Three.

02:46.237 --> 02:47.367
(Grunts)

02:47.368 --> 02:49.168
(Curtis and Ethan grunt)

02:49.169 --> 02:50.540
Oh.

02:50.541 --> 02:53.273
(Megan) Frozen body
changes all the usual routines.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.305
We're gonna have to
wait at least 48 hours

02:55.306 --> 02:56.546
to do a controlled thaw.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.248
Yeah, the same 48 hours

02:58.249 --> 03:00.310
when a murder has the
best chance of being solved.

03:00.311 --> 03:01.511
Well, let's just stay positive.

03:01.512 --> 03:03.483
We can X-ray the body.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.184
And we can process it

03:05.185 --> 03:07.287
while it thaws
from the outside in.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.188
(Kate) The rest
is a waiting game.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.460
Ooh. This must have
been a bloody mess.

03:10.461 --> 03:12.191
Understatement.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.393
Any thoughts on
the murder weapon?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.265
I'd say it was big
enough to knock him out,

03:15.266 --> 03:16.466
but not big enough to kill him.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.197
Well, based on the
shape of the wound

03:18.198 --> 03:19.399
and the fact that your
crime scene's a restaurant,

03:19.400 --> 03:20.470
I'd say you're looking for

03:20.471 --> 03:22.502
an industrial-sized
kitchen utensil.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.234
The good news, I'm looking

03:24.235 --> 03:26.205
at an industrial-grade
meat tenderizer.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.477
(Kate) What's the bad news?

03:27.478 --> 03:29.339
It's been through
the dishwasher.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.411
Any evidence of the
killer is long gone.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.482
Bag it.

03:32.483 --> 03:34.213
Okay. (Beeps)

03:34.214 --> 03:35.345
(Door opens)

03:35.346 --> 03:37.347
I just found a dozen
bloody dishrags

03:37.348 --> 03:38.548
in a dumpster out back.

03:38.549 --> 03:40.450
C.s.u.'s bagging
and tagging 'em.

03:40.451 --> 03:43.222
Sounds like somebody
cleaned up after themselves.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.354
Yeah, but where?

03:44.355 --> 03:45.555
I mean, I photographed
every inch of that freezer.

03:45.556 --> 03:49.259
If there were signs of
cleanup, I would've seen 'em.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.432
What about the outside?

03:55.266 --> 03:56.566
Hit the lights.

03:56.567 --> 03:59.309
(People speaking indistinctly)

03:59.310 --> 04:01.442
(Spritzing)

04:03.514 --> 04:05.515
Well, there you have it.

04:05.516 --> 04:08.618
Joe was attacked out here

04:08.619 --> 04:10.450
and then dragged
inside the freezer.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.251
Okay, riddle me this.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.583
Why would you clean
up on the outside

04:13.584 --> 04:15.385
and not the inside?

04:15.386 --> 04:18.289
Maybe he ran out of time.

04:23.394 --> 04:25.435
Huh.

04:25.436 --> 04:27.266
Whoa.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.340
But he definitely
ran out that door.

04:34.475 --> 04:38.409
(People speaking indistinctly)

05:07.378 --> 05:08.478
(Faucet turns on)

05:08.479 --> 05:10.309
(Faucet turns off)

05:10.310 --> 05:12.382
(Breathes heavily)

05:12.383 --> 05:13.543
Aah!

05:13.544 --> 05:15.445
Hands where I can see 'em.

05:15.446 --> 05:17.447
(Pants)

05:17.448 --> 05:21.422
(Fabric snaps)

05:30.401 --> 05:32.101
I don't understand why I'm here.

05:32.102 --> 05:33.363
Well, let's start with

05:33.364 --> 05:34.564
why you were cleaning
blood off your shoes

05:34.565 --> 05:36.035
and work our way up.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.437
Blood? (Laughs)

05:37.438 --> 05:39.038
It was tomato sauce.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.040
Okay. I'll bite.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.473
How'd you get tomato
sauce on your shoes?

05:43.474 --> 05:45.575
Someone spilled it
on the kitchen floor,

05:45.576 --> 05:47.346
so I cleaned it up.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.078
And what were you doing in
the kitchen in the first place?

05:49.079 --> 05:51.481
I own sanella's with
my brother-in-law Joe.

05:51.482 --> 05:52.582
We're partners.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.525
Just ask Joe. He'll
straighten all this out.

05:55.526 --> 05:57.428
I can't. He's dead.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.062
(Megan) Mr. Pedroni.

06:03.093 --> 06:04.435
Are you okay?

06:06.096 --> 06:08.097
It was those punk kids
that robbed me and Joe

06:08.098 --> 06:09.499
a few months back,

06:09.500 --> 06:11.441
waved guns in our faces.

06:11.442 --> 06:12.572
We I.D.'Ed them.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.103
This was payback.

06:14.104 --> 06:16.606
Great. So there's
a police report.

06:16.607 --> 06:18.408
What are their names?

06:18.409 --> 06:20.049
Ask Joe. He'll remember.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.582
(Laughs)

06:23.484 --> 06:25.455
Henry?

06:25.456 --> 06:27.116
Hello? Henry?

06:27.117 --> 06:29.118
I'm Dr. Megan hunt.

06:29.119 --> 06:32.061
Do you understand
that Joe is dead?

06:32.062 --> 06:33.423
I know that.

06:33.424 --> 06:34.594
Then why did you just tell us

06:34.595 --> 06:36.466
to ask him the
name of those kids?

06:36.467 --> 06:37.627
I didn't. You're wrong.

06:37.628 --> 06:40.530
Okay. Sorry.

06:40.531 --> 06:42.171
My mistake.

06:42.172 --> 06:46.075
May I ask you another question?

06:46.076 --> 06:49.138
Have you ever been diagnosed
with any type of dementia?

06:49.139 --> 06:51.080
I don't have Alzheimer's.

06:51.081 --> 06:52.482
You're wrong.

06:52.483 --> 06:54.414
All you doctors are wrong.

06:57.087 --> 06:59.519
I saw this all the time
as a neurosurgeon.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.591
(Sighs) Henry exhibits
all the classic symptoms

07:01.592 --> 07:03.192
of early Alzheimer's...

07:03.193 --> 07:05.525
Confusion, short-term
memory loss,

07:05.526 --> 07:07.126
difficulty answering questions.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.197
He seemed fine to me

07:08.198 --> 07:09.559
until we accused him of murder.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.531
We caught him cleaning
blood off his shoes.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.133
And don't you wonder
why he was doing that

07:14.134 --> 07:16.105
two days after the crime?

07:16.106 --> 07:17.637
He heard us coming and panicked.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.609
Or his concept of
time is skewed...

07:19.610 --> 07:21.471
Also a symptom.

07:21.472 --> 07:24.113
(Indistinct conversations)

07:24.114 --> 07:25.444
Look...

07:25.445 --> 07:28.578
Imagine how
petrified you would be

07:28.579 --> 07:32.121
if you started to forget
the simplest things...

07:32.122 --> 07:33.523
Geography of your neighborhood,

07:33.524 --> 07:35.585
where you parked your
car at the grocery store.

07:35.586 --> 07:37.587
And then one day,
you catch yourself

07:37.588 --> 07:39.659
brushing your hair
with your toothbrush...

07:39.660 --> 07:41.561
Well, not you...

07:41.562 --> 07:44.163
And it scares you
because you are still

07:44.164 --> 07:47.236
lucid enough to know
how crazy that is.

07:47.237 --> 07:49.569
And then you know
what's really scary?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.701
One day, it won't
seem crazy at all,

07:51.702 --> 07:54.644
because you are
too far gone to notice.

07:54.645 --> 07:56.506
So you're saying,
Henry's innocent?

07:56.507 --> 07:58.608
I'm saying, that if he's guilty,

07:58.609 --> 08:01.681
he might not remember
the crime at all.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.213
It's a match.

08:04.214 --> 08:06.616
This meat tenderizer is guilty.

08:06.617 --> 08:08.558
That must have hurt.

08:08.559 --> 08:11.160
Yeah, kinda like how it felt when you
moved in on Dani. (Camera shutter clicks)

08:11.161 --> 08:13.663
Would you get over it, Ethan?

08:13.664 --> 08:15.264
Okay. That sounds good.

08:15.265 --> 08:17.496
Why don't you tell
me how to feel now?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.728
Okay, I think I'm done here.

08:18.729 --> 08:20.230
Yeah, you are.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.705
How long you gon' keep this up?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.241
Wait. Wait. Check
this out. Check this out.

08:32.242 --> 08:35.585
The decedent's shirt is
completely soaked in blood,

08:35.586 --> 08:39.248
but there's only one
isolated drop on his pant leg.

08:39.249 --> 08:41.220
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:41.221 --> 08:43.522
You petty and immature? Yeah.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.556
No, the blood drop
could belong to the killer.

08:46.557 --> 08:48.558
You heading out?

08:48.559 --> 08:49.729
Hey.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.231
Uh, yeah. Bud's tracked
down Joe sanella's family.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.604
So we're, um,
meeting them at p.D.

08:54.605 --> 08:57.206
(People speaking indistinctly)

08:57.207 --> 08:59.538
So...

08:59.539 --> 09:00.740
What did they say?

09:00.741 --> 09:04.714
That my biological father
lives 2 miles from here.

09:04.715 --> 09:06.315
How poetic.

09:06.316 --> 09:07.717
M-Maybe you guys stood in line

09:07.718 --> 09:10.319
next to each other
at the coffee shop.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.622
Two strangers, totally clueless,

09:12.623 --> 09:14.223
biological connection.

09:14.224 --> 09:16.255
Well, a stranger
is still a stranger.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.629
Are you gonna call?

09:20.290 --> 09:22.231
When I'm ready, maybe.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.292
I gotta go.

09:23.293 --> 09:25.564
Peter...

09:25.565 --> 09:27.336
Call.

09:27.337 --> 09:28.799
See you.

09:31.642 --> 09:33.643
When Joe picked me
up for our first date,

09:33.644 --> 09:35.645
my brother Henry
made sure he was there

09:35.646 --> 09:36.806
to scare him away.

09:36.807 --> 09:37.807
(Chuckles)

09:37.808 --> 09:39.578
But it didn't work.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.780
Instead, they
became best friends.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.251
Mm-hmm.

09:42.252 --> 09:43.653
Even though they
were polar opposites.

09:43.654 --> 09:47.356
Mm. Maybe that was the
secret to sanella's success.

09:47.357 --> 09:48.658
Yeah.

09:48.659 --> 09:50.660
It was a simple recipe...

09:50.661 --> 09:52.261
Joe was the people person,

09:52.262 --> 09:55.264
and... Henry kept the books.

09:55.265 --> 09:57.667
They made a hell of a team.

09:57.668 --> 10:00.600
Did that change after
Henry's diagnosis?

10:01.802 --> 10:04.603
Joe had to pick up the slack.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.305
It's been a struggle.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.277
But he let Henry keep working.

10:08.278 --> 10:10.780
He knew Henry needed
something to hold on to,

10:10.781 --> 10:12.842
to still feel useful.

10:12.843 --> 10:14.814
Mm-hmm.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.846
That was my Joe.

10:16.847 --> 10:22.292
He was always concerned
about other people's feelings.

10:24.755 --> 10:26.625
Dr. Hunt,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.297
may I see my husband now?

10:28.298 --> 10:29.829
I'd like to say good-bye.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.762
I'm very sorry, but
that's not possible yet.

10:32.763 --> 10:35.364
Soon, though.

10:35.365 --> 10:36.837
Okay.

10:39.309 --> 10:40.710
Would you...

10:40.711 --> 10:43.312
Like to see Henry?

10:43.313 --> 10:45.845
Do you think he killed Joe?

10:45.846 --> 10:48.719
Do you?

10:58.428 --> 10:59.759
We came as soon as we heard.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.360
The organic farm
gets spotty reception.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.431
Look, I know my
father's a sick man,

11:02.432 --> 11:04.363
but he'd never hurt uncle Joe.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.865
The evidence says otherwise.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.737
What did Henry say happened?

11:07.738 --> 11:09.739
Caren, please
let me handle this.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.901
Henry says Joe was
killed by a group of teens

11:11.902 --> 11:13.843
that robbed the place
a few months back,

11:13.844 --> 11:15.805
but I found no
record of the incident.

11:15.806 --> 11:17.808
Yeah, it's 'cause that
happened when I was 12.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.380
You know what? Screw this.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.853
M-Mr. P...

11:23.854 --> 11:26.355
Mr. Pedroni.

11:26.356 --> 11:29.759
This has been so
hard for Anthony.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.391
We moved back here to help.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.824
Turns out Henry
doesn't want any.

11:34.825 --> 11:37.727
He won't go to the doctor.
He won't take his meds.

11:37.728 --> 11:41.401
Have you... ever
seen Henry get violent?

11:42.873 --> 11:44.904
He once threw a chair at Anthony

11:44.905 --> 11:47.376
for refusing to
give him car keys.

11:47.377 --> 11:50.740
Well, Alzheimer's
patients can get frustrated.

11:50.741 --> 11:52.842
Believe me, I know.

11:52.843 --> 11:54.784
Does Anthony?

11:54.785 --> 11:59.388
He's still looking
for his father.

11:59.389 --> 12:01.952
But Henry's already gone.

12:07.457 --> 12:10.830
(Keypad beeping)

12:10.831 --> 12:12.401
(Inhales deeply)

12:12.402 --> 12:13.462
(Phone rings)

12:13.463 --> 12:14.733
(Sighs)

12:14.734 --> 12:15.866
(Man) Hello?

12:17.467 --> 12:18.808
Hello.

12:18.809 --> 12:19.869
(Elevator bell dings)

12:19.870 --> 12:21.470
(Indistinct conversations)

12:21.471 --> 12:22.872
Megan!

12:22.873 --> 12:24.413
Hold the doors.

12:24.414 --> 12:26.816
I just got the preliminary
d.N.A. Results

12:26.817 --> 12:29.748
on the blood drop Ethan
found on the decedent's pants.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.920
Did it belong to the decedent?

12:30.921 --> 12:32.922
Nope. Did you
get a database hit?

12:32.923 --> 12:34.884
No. Then why are you
holding me hostage?

12:34.885 --> 12:37.486
Because the donor's
positive for sickle cell trait.

12:37.487 --> 12:41.760
Which is most common
in people of African decent.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.432
What you lookin' at me for?

12:43.433 --> 12:44.934
The donor was female.

12:44.935 --> 12:47.766
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

12:47.767 --> 12:49.439
Where are you going?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.872
We have a new suspect.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.906
Oh, hell.

13:03.253 --> 13:06.315
Delia, are you positive
for the sickle cell gene trait?

13:06.316 --> 13:08.157
Um...

13:08.158 --> 13:09.488
Yeah. How do you know that?

13:09.489 --> 13:12.221
Because we found a drop
of blood on Joe's pants

13:12.222 --> 13:14.163
with that very same gene.

13:14.164 --> 13:16.395
I cut myself on a cheese
grater Sunday night.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.297
Joe patched me up.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.498
He was good like that.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.270
Fussed over me like I
was his own daughter.

13:21.271 --> 13:22.401
How's this for a plan?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.333
You kill your boss, you
come back two days later,

13:24.334 --> 13:25.474
find the body.

13:25.475 --> 13:28.207
Oh, so you think I shocked
myself on purpose, too, huh?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.179
No, we'll just chalk
that up to bad Karma.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.410
You did have access and motive.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.481
What motive?

13:32.482 --> 13:34.213
Why aren't you manager?

13:34.214 --> 13:37.146
Hmm? You been here a long time.

13:37.147 --> 13:38.347
I don't know.

13:38.348 --> 13:40.149
(Cell phone ringing) Well,
let me explain it to you.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.151
The only people who get
promoted at a family business

13:42.152 --> 13:43.352
are family.

13:43.353 --> 13:45.154
(Rings and beeps)

13:45.155 --> 13:46.295
Morris.

13:46.296 --> 13:48.297
So it must have stung
when Joe hired Anthony back

13:48.298 --> 13:50.299
to help run sanella's
after Henry got sick.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.430
It's not like that.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.362
Anthony and I are cool.

13:53.363 --> 13:55.304
And besides, he
hates this place.

13:55.305 --> 13:56.535
(Beep) Why do you think
he moved to California?

13:56.536 --> 14:00.409
Coming home was
his worst nightmare.

14:00.410 --> 14:01.510
(Indistinct conversations)

14:01.511 --> 14:03.242
I'm out.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.414
I got work to do.

14:05.515 --> 14:08.517
I just got a hit on
that live-wire print.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.449
A woman named Annabelle kip,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.251
did a 2-year stint
for money laundering.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.322
Hmm.

14:13.323 --> 14:15.524
I'll run with it.

14:15.525 --> 14:17.356
(Morris) So, Annabelle,

14:17.357 --> 14:20.459
what's your connection
with Joe sanella?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.461
(Sighs) I'm a restaurateur.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.463
I secure the rights
to existing businesses

14:24.464 --> 14:26.435
and I expand them
into a franchise.

14:26.436 --> 14:28.437
I met with Joe and
Henry last week

14:28.438 --> 14:30.339
to discuss purchasing sanella's.

14:30.340 --> 14:33.372
Joe did all the talking.
His partner's a nut job.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.374
So Joe and Henry
build up the business,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.447
you pay 'em off and get rich.

14:38.448 --> 14:41.410
Bottom line, I can
take it to the next level.

14:41.411 --> 14:43.212
Joe and Henry can't.

14:43.213 --> 14:44.553
That's why I offered them
$2 million. (Computer beeps)

14:44.554 --> 14:46.285
That's a lot. Mm.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.416
Did they take it?

14:47.417 --> 14:49.218
Turned me down flat.

14:49.219 --> 14:51.490
Said his family's
legacy wasn't for sale.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.392
That's called integrity.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.265
(Laughs)

14:56.266 --> 14:58.567
What good is integrity
if you're broke?

14:58.568 --> 15:00.599
Or dead, like Joe.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.402
(Laughs)

15:03.403 --> 15:05.434
You're joking, right?

15:05.435 --> 15:07.236
No joke.

15:07.237 --> 15:09.308
And your fingerprints
were at the crime scene.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.480
They're in the system because
you have a criminal history.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.282
Which is ancient history.

15:13.283 --> 15:14.283
(Object clatters)

15:14.284 --> 15:16.445
Old habits die hard.

15:16.446 --> 15:18.317
What happened, Joe had
the guts to say no to you,

15:18.318 --> 15:19.588
so you had to
teach him a lesson?

15:19.589 --> 15:21.420
You calling your lawyer now?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.522
Oh, yeah, to rescind my offer.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.596
If Joe's dead, sanella's
price just dropped.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.429
There's some sort
of black substance

15:30.430 --> 15:31.630
adhering to the left palm,

15:31.631 --> 15:33.562
but no burns.

15:33.563 --> 15:36.565
I do have a burn
on the right hand.

15:36.566 --> 15:39.268
It's reddish and granular.

15:39.269 --> 15:40.339
I'll have to confirm
microscopically

15:40.340 --> 15:41.410
to know if it's electrical.

15:41.411 --> 15:43.443
It looks pretty minor.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.445
Huh. This is strange.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.318
I've got petechial
hemorrhaging in the eyes

15:49.319 --> 15:50.519
and on the eyelids.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.621
Which suggests asphyxia
as cause of death,

15:52.622 --> 15:54.523
not hypothermia.

15:54.524 --> 15:58.657
So do these lacerations
on the inner lips and gums.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.330
Somebody forced their
hand over Joe's mouth.

16:01.331 --> 16:02.661
Yeah, he was clearly
fighting to breathe.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.663
But both the fetal
position and frostbite

16:04.664 --> 16:07.596
suggest hypothermia
as cause of death.

16:07.597 --> 16:09.338
If the cause of death
is still a mystery,

16:09.339 --> 16:11.059
maybe the answer is
back at the crime scene.

16:17.307 --> 16:20.310
(Indistinct conversations)

16:28.388 --> 16:29.458
Peter?

16:29.459 --> 16:31.390
Yeah.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.592
Jack Cranston.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.663
Hi.

16:34.664 --> 16:36.526
H-Have a seat.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.702
Wow. This is every
bit as awkward

16:43.703 --> 16:45.434
as... as I imagined.

16:45.435 --> 16:47.676
(Chuckles) I-I think
it's supposed to be.

16:47.677 --> 16:49.538
(Sighs)

16:49.539 --> 16:51.510
I'm...

16:51.511 --> 16:53.342
Really glad you called.

16:53.343 --> 16:54.483
You're just...

16:54.484 --> 16:56.345
You're just not what I
imagined. (Chuckles)

16:56.346 --> 16:59.488
You're exactly what I pictured.

16:59.489 --> 17:01.620
You look just like her.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.722
My mom?

17:04.624 --> 17:07.356
You know, the, uh...

17:07.357 --> 17:08.697
The agency didn't have
her current address,

17:08.698 --> 17:10.429
so I was hoping
that you could...

17:10.430 --> 17:13.432
I'm sorry, Peter. I-I
thought you knew.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.405
She died.

17:17.507 --> 17:19.368
M-Maybe this
isn't the best place

17:19.369 --> 17:20.439
for us to start.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.511
Just...

17:22.512 --> 17:23.642
Just tell me.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.545
Okay.

17:26.716 --> 17:29.418
The day after you were born,

17:29.419 --> 17:31.521
there were complications.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.723
She hemorrhaged.

17:34.724 --> 17:36.655
The doctors couldn't
stop the bleeding.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.387
So what was her name?

17:38.388 --> 17:39.528
Katie.

17:39.529 --> 17:41.590
Katie trammell.

17:41.591 --> 17:43.592
(Chuckles)

17:43.593 --> 17:47.466
We started dating
our junior year.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.668
We were 16 when
she got pregnant.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.540
So you decided to give me up?

17:51.541 --> 17:53.502
I wanted you to have a chance.

17:53.503 --> 17:55.604
I just... i wasn't
ready for that.

17:55.605 --> 17:57.706
Yeah, you know what? I'm
not really ready for this. I just...

17:57.707 --> 18:00.609
Hey... okay, hey. Look...

18:00.610 --> 18:02.551
We can do this any way you want

18:02.552 --> 18:04.453
or not at all.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.457
I just wanted you to have this.

18:23.773 --> 18:25.704
Ain't no way in hell I'm
laying on the ground.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.506
All right. Come on. Come on.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.637
Recreating the crime scene

18:28.638 --> 18:30.479
might help us
determine cause of death.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.610
I'm on a diet.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.612
The last place I should be
is in a freezer full of food.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.544
So don't poke a hungry bear.

18:35.545 --> 18:36.785
A man only has so much strength.

18:36.786 --> 18:38.817
Okay, hungry bear, fine.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.451
We found the
victim... Excuse me...

18:42.452 --> 18:45.454
Like this, right?

18:45.455 --> 18:46.525
We know that Joe
was hit over the head

18:46.526 --> 18:47.656
in the kitchen,

18:47.657 --> 18:48.797
dragged into the freezer,

18:48.798 --> 18:51.730
and after that, things
get a little bit hazy.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.632
What doesn't look right?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.604
The blood pools.

18:55.605 --> 18:57.606
If Joe was on the ground
bleeding from his head,

18:57.607 --> 18:59.768
why is most of the
blood pooled at his waist?

18:59.769 --> 19:01.510
Excellent question.

19:01.511 --> 19:02.671
Uh, well...

19:02.672 --> 19:04.613
It's a simple matter of gravity.

19:04.614 --> 19:07.746
The... the head wound had to
be directly above this blood pool,

19:07.747 --> 19:10.479
which means... (Exhales deeply)

19:10.480 --> 19:11.850
Joe was sitting up.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.522
But if he was
knocked unconscious,

19:13.523 --> 19:14.623
how's he hold himself up?

19:14.624 --> 19:16.825
He didn't. Somebody
did it for him.

19:16.826 --> 19:18.727
Show me.

19:18.728 --> 19:20.829
Why do...

19:20.830 --> 19:22.761
Ohh.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.833
Oh, boy. Cuddle
time? It's cuddle time.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.865
Say that again, and we'll have
a whole nother crime scene.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.537
Oh, you're warm.

19:28.538 --> 19:29.598
(Speaks indistinctly)

19:29.599 --> 19:31.570
All right, we know
that there was bruising

19:31.571 --> 19:32.841
in the inner lips, gums,

19:32.842 --> 19:35.604
which says that the killer
held his hand over Joe's mouth.

19:35.605 --> 19:37.776
Well, this... this would be
the ideal position to do that.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.508
I like this part. Shut up.

19:39.509 --> 19:40.779
(Mutters) Wait. So Joe
was suffocated to death?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.511
That doesn't make any s...

19:42.512 --> 19:43.712
It doesn't make any
sense. (Muttering)

19:43.713 --> 19:45.784
We know he was alive
when the frostbite set in.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.656
That takes a while.

19:47.657 --> 19:49.888
Judging by all the blood
pooling around my waist,

19:49.889 --> 19:52.521
Joe was sitting
up for a long time.

19:52.522 --> 19:53.862
That means that...

19:53.863 --> 19:56.865
The killer must have
gotten frostbite, too, right?

19:56.866 --> 19:58.867
Uh, if they were
here for 20 minutes,

19:58.868 --> 20:00.599
maybe, maybe not.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.601
Why would he stick around?

20:02.602 --> 20:03.802
I'm freezing my ass off.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.575
He wouldn't have
stayed unless he had to.

20:06.576 --> 20:09.778
Because he heard Henry outside.

20:09.779 --> 20:13.612
Right, that's why the killer
dragged Joe in here and hid.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.545
He was waiting
for Henry to leave.

20:16.546 --> 20:17.886
So Henry isn't our killer.

20:17.887 --> 20:20.689
No, but he might
be our only witness,

20:20.690 --> 20:22.692
and he doesn't even know it.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.897
I already told you everything.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.630
It helps if you just
go through the events

20:31.631 --> 20:32.761
step-by-step.

20:32.762 --> 20:34.763
You never know what's
gonna trigger a memory.

20:34.764 --> 20:35.964
So just relax...

20:35.965 --> 20:37.836
Breathe,

20:37.837 --> 20:39.939
start from the beginning.

20:41.971 --> 20:44.644
I, uh...

20:45.875 --> 20:48.717
I walked into the kitchen.

20:48.718 --> 20:51.680
I saw the stuff on the floor.

20:51.681 --> 20:54.953
Was there anything else
on the floor besides blood?

20:54.954 --> 20:56.685
Yeah.

20:56.686 --> 20:59.988
I saw a...

20:59.989 --> 21:01.830
What's it called?

21:01.831 --> 21:02.991
A meat tenderizer?

21:02.992 --> 21:06.665
Yes, a sausage. Joe loves them.

21:06.666 --> 21:07.896
A sausage.

21:07.897 --> 21:09.838
Wait.

21:09.839 --> 21:11.871
No. Um...

21:13.803 --> 21:15.974
I don't know.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.876
What is happening to me?

21:17.877 --> 21:18.977
It's okay. It's okay.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.749
I'm afraid. I know you are.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.781
No, you don't know.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.982
(Pants)

21:23.983 --> 21:25.714
I'm afraid...

21:25.715 --> 21:26.985
(Pants)

21:26.986 --> 21:28.817
That I killed Joe.

21:28.818 --> 21:30.759
(Crying)

21:30.760 --> 21:32.791
I don't want to believe
that I'd hurt him, but...

21:32.792 --> 21:34.763
I'm losing my mind,

21:34.764 --> 21:37.726
and I don't know.

21:37.727 --> 21:39.698
What if I killed him?

21:39.699 --> 21:42.901
Henry, listen to me.

21:42.902 --> 21:46.705
The evidence says
that you are innocent.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.707
It's much stronger than memory.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.039
(Normal voice) Why
can't I remember?

21:51.040 --> 21:54.082
I feel like i'm...

21:54.083 --> 21:55.984
Slowly...

21:55.985 --> 21:57.816
Disappearing.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.047
Henry, I wish that I could...

21:59.048 --> 22:01.890
Stop this disease
that's in your brain.

22:01.891 --> 22:04.823
I do, but I can't.

22:04.824 --> 22:08.056
But I can promise you this...

22:08.057 --> 22:11.730
You will still have your family,

22:11.731 --> 22:14.102
and when the time comes,

22:14.103 --> 22:17.065
they will remember for you.

22:17.066 --> 22:19.808
(Sniffles)

22:19.809 --> 22:22.010
You sound like Joe.

22:22.011 --> 22:24.112
He woulda liked you.

22:24.113 --> 22:26.876
I think I would've liked Joe.

22:31.881 --> 22:33.122
Wait.

22:35.825 --> 22:37.026
I do remember.

22:38.928 --> 22:40.789
I saw Alice in the kitchen.

22:40.790 --> 22:41.960
Who's Alice?

22:41.961 --> 22:44.863
She was running
out the back door...

22:44.864 --> 22:46.796
Covered in blood.

22:48.938 --> 22:50.869
Alice was Henry's wife.

22:50.870 --> 22:55.043
She passed away ten
years ago from cancer.

22:55.044 --> 22:57.776
Hello, Maria.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.948
Henry. Henry.

22:59.949 --> 23:02.981
(Indistinct conversations)

23:02.982 --> 23:04.052
Let's get you home, okay?

23:04.053 --> 23:05.113
You all right?

23:05.114 --> 23:06.985
Eh, tired.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.116
You hungry?

23:08.117 --> 23:09.988
Yeah. Yeah, soup, I think.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.860
(Maria) Yeah.

23:11.861 --> 23:13.862
We got any stale bread?

23:13.863 --> 23:16.024
Yeah. Whatever you
want? (Speaks indistinctly)

23:16.025 --> 23:19.067
I still think part of what
Henry said was true.

23:19.068 --> 23:22.831
Yeah? Which part?

23:22.832 --> 23:26.875
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

23:26.876 --> 23:28.977
(Ethan) You know
that black trace

23:28.978 --> 23:30.038
that Kate found
on the Vic's hand?

23:30.039 --> 23:31.179
Mm-hmm.

23:31.180 --> 23:33.812
Uh, the lab identified it
as industrial printer toner.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.814
A hewlett-packard
3-4-6-a toner, to be exact.

23:35.815 --> 23:36.885
I'm listening.

23:36.886 --> 23:37.946
Now you remember that dumpster

23:37.947 --> 23:39.017
where Pete found
the bloody rags?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.148
Yes. I checked the evidence log.

23:40.149 --> 23:42.891
A c.S.U. Tech found
crumpled specs

23:42.892 --> 23:45.093
for what could be a
potential sanella's franchise.

23:45.094 --> 23:47.025
Courtesy of Annabelle kip?

23:47.026 --> 23:48.857
Exactly.

23:48.858 --> 23:50.859
Now the ink on the
specs matches the toner

23:50.860 --> 23:52.030
on Joe's hand.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.202
So if we match it to
the printer in her office,

23:54.203 --> 23:55.934
it puts her at the scene.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.105
We need a warrant.

23:57.106 --> 23:58.907
Yeah, that's not
enough for a warrant,

23:58.908 --> 24:00.038
even from my mother.

24:00.039 --> 24:05.043
It is, however, enough
for another chat.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.015
(Morris) You
sabotage the live wire?

24:07.016 --> 24:09.217
My client would like to invoke
her fifth amendment right.

24:09.218 --> 24:11.049
That boat has sailed.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.851
Hypothetically speaking,

24:12.852 --> 24:15.183
someone may have rigged
the wire for a low-amp shock

24:15.184 --> 24:17.055
in the hopes that
an employee injury

24:17.056 --> 24:19.127
would get sanella's slapped
with an osha violation.

24:19.128 --> 24:21.189
You were bullying
them into selling.

24:21.190 --> 24:23.932
(Inhales deeply) Hypothetically.

24:23.933 --> 24:25.133
(Megan) Annabelle.

24:25.134 --> 24:27.135
We found your franchise specs

24:27.136 --> 24:29.237
in the dumpster
behind the restaurant.

24:29.238 --> 24:32.240
There's evidence of
matching toner on Joe's hand.

24:32.241 --> 24:34.072
Puts you at the crime scene.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.203
In what universe?
(Morris) Now look...

24:35.204 --> 24:38.076
I-I'm sorry. I didn't
give the specs to Joe.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.108
I gave them to his
nephew Anthony.

24:40.109 --> 24:41.209
Anthony?

24:41.210 --> 24:43.111
Why were you talking to Anthony?

24:43.112 --> 24:45.153
Well, he thought Joe was
crazy to decline my offer,

24:45.154 --> 24:47.215
so he paid me himself
to draw up the specs.

24:47.216 --> 24:50.018
Here is the canceled check.

24:50.019 --> 24:51.960
Why?

24:51.961 --> 24:53.221
Well, he wanted to use the specs

24:53.222 --> 24:55.023
to warm up Joe to the idea.

24:55.024 --> 24:57.095
In fact, he picked them up
from my office on Sunday night.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.898
After which, I went out
clubbing with my friends

24:59.899 --> 25:01.099
well into the next morning.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.171
Oh, their names and
numbers are at the bottom

25:03.172 --> 25:05.133
if you wish to confirm.

25:05.134 --> 25:08.006
Any questions?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.139
(Megan) No, but if
you're lying, you'll be back.

25:11.140 --> 25:14.112
Hypothetically.

25:14.113 --> 25:17.015
(Morris) Annabelle told us she
gave you the franchise specs.

25:17.016 --> 25:20.989
We found trace of those
specs on Joe's fingers,

25:20.990 --> 25:23.151
which puts you at sanella's
the night of the murder.

25:23.152 --> 25:25.193
Now you went
there to convince him

25:25.194 --> 25:27.055
to take the offer, didn't you?

25:27.056 --> 25:28.126
No.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.197
I never went.

25:29.198 --> 25:30.959
I was driving to
the organic farm

25:30.960 --> 25:32.100
with my family.

25:32.101 --> 25:33.261
(Laughs)

25:33.262 --> 25:35.203
Pinocchio...

25:35.204 --> 25:37.005
Your nose is growing.

25:37.006 --> 25:39.307
I'd never hurt Joe. I loved him.

25:39.308 --> 25:41.239
But you hated the
family business.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.211
The way I hear it, you
fled all the way to California

25:43.212 --> 25:44.943
to escape it.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.945
I came home because
my father needed me.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.016
Yeah.

25:48.017 --> 25:50.078
You're a good son.

25:50.079 --> 25:53.021
But your dad's only
gonna get sicker.

25:53.022 --> 25:54.953
Then what happens?

25:54.954 --> 25:58.186
You are stuck at
sanella's forever.

25:58.187 --> 26:01.189
And then in walks Annabelle kip

26:01.190 --> 26:04.262
with a golden parachute
for the whole family...

26:04.263 --> 26:07.095
$2 million. (Chuckles)

26:07.096 --> 26:08.236
But Joe...

26:08.237 --> 26:10.238
He's a stubborn old bastard.

26:10.239 --> 26:12.270
He's not thinking about you.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.073
What choice did you have?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.274
I want a lawyer.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.046
I'm not saying another word.

26:18.047 --> 26:20.048
Fair enough.

26:20.049 --> 26:23.181
(Inhales deeply) Joe's
body will do the talking.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.153
I bet...

26:25.154 --> 26:27.116
It's got a lot to say.

26:31.991 --> 26:35.164
The long thaw is finally over.

26:37.026 --> 26:38.226
The body is cherry
red from head to toe,

26:38.227 --> 26:40.168
which is consistent
with hypothermia.

26:40.169 --> 26:42.100
Same thing on the inside.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.331
All the internal organs

26:43.332 --> 26:47.105
are a beautiful
burgundy discoloration.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.336
They're autolyzing.

26:48.337 --> 26:50.338
The cell membranes
are breaking down.

26:50.339 --> 26:54.012
It's nature's way of putting
us back into the food chain.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.113
(Chuckles)

26:55.114 --> 26:56.184
Huh.

26:56.185 --> 27:00.218
The right lung
airway is decaying.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.389
Something's...

27:01.390 --> 27:04.092
Lodged inside.

27:04.093 --> 27:05.293
(Scissors click)

27:05.294 --> 27:07.396
(Clatter)

27:21.270 --> 27:22.411
Hmm. Tweezers.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.076
Looks like a chunk of
food covered with bacteria.

27:28.077 --> 27:29.347
Food for thought?

27:29.348 --> 27:32.320
It takes a tough bug to
thrive in the extreme cold.

27:32.321 --> 27:35.323
Henry talked about
seeing a sausage

27:35.324 --> 27:37.055
on the kitchen floor

27:37.056 --> 27:39.187
when he was
cleaning up the blood.

27:39.188 --> 27:42.190
And bud and I both thought
that he was talking nonsense,

27:42.191 --> 27:44.192
but maybe he's more
of a reliable witness

27:44.193 --> 27:45.363
than we realize.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.365
So Joe's eating,

27:47.366 --> 27:49.367
the killer hits him on the head

27:49.368 --> 27:51.099
with a meat tenderizer,

27:51.100 --> 27:53.141
and Joe chokes.

27:53.142 --> 27:55.173
That's why the killer
was covering his mouth.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.304
Joe was making a racket

27:56.305 --> 27:57.445
that might have drawn
Henry's attention.

27:57.446 --> 28:00.078
The killer was shutting Joe up.

28:00.079 --> 28:03.351
And if Joe inhaled the bacteria
from the killer's hand, then...

28:03.352 --> 28:07.085
Then identifying it
would lead us to the killer.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.088
Get it to the lab.

28:19.969 --> 28:21.830
C.o.d. Was asphyxiation?

28:21.831 --> 28:22.971
No, the food bolus

28:22.972 --> 28:24.773
only partially
blocked Joe's airway.

28:24.774 --> 28:26.775
He was still able to get
enough air to breathe.

28:26.776 --> 28:29.778
He ultimately succumbed
to hypothermia.

28:29.779 --> 28:31.780
So the bacteria's
all we've got then.

28:31.781 --> 28:34.042
We also... have a witness.

28:34.043 --> 28:35.914
Who, Henry?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.986
I believe that Henry
saw who killed Joe.

28:37.987 --> 28:39.717
But his dementia

28:39.718 --> 28:41.719
is preventing him from
communicating what he saw.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.852
Megan, a witness with
Alzheimer's isn't a witness.

28:43.853 --> 28:46.024
I'm not so sure that
he has Alzheimer's.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.797
Really? Based on what?

28:48.798 --> 28:49.998
His gait.

28:49.999 --> 28:52.730
He shuffles like his feet
are stuck to the ground.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.033
That's more indicative
of Parkinson's

28:55.034 --> 28:57.035
or some other kind of
neurological disorder,

28:57.036 --> 28:59.107
but not Alzheimer's.

28:59.108 --> 29:00.809
So you think he
was misdiagnosed?

29:00.810 --> 29:02.771
His doctor didn't
even get an m.R.I.

29:02.772 --> 29:04.873
I really want to figure out
what's going on in his brain.

29:04.874 --> 29:07.776
Why is it that every time
you can't find an answer,

29:07.777 --> 29:09.077
you assume someone
else made a mistake?

29:09.078 --> 29:11.019
Uh, because I'm right.

29:11.020 --> 29:13.051
Henry's dementia

29:13.052 --> 29:14.853
might be treatable.

29:14.854 --> 29:18.857
He might become lucid
enough to tell us what he saw.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.088
Well, you'd need
the family's consent,

29:20.089 --> 29:22.090
which might be a
bit of a challenge

29:22.091 --> 29:24.863
now that Anthony's
our prime suspect.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.064
I really think you're
underestimating

29:26.065 --> 29:28.066
my considerable charm.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.868
I think you'll do anything

29:29.869 --> 29:31.800
to get Henry to say
that Anthony killed Joe.

29:31.801 --> 29:33.802
Are you so afraid of the truth

29:33.803 --> 29:35.844
that you would sacrifice
your brother's mind?

29:35.845 --> 29:38.847
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You
mean, you can cure him?

29:38.848 --> 29:40.108
Yes, it's possible,

29:40.109 --> 29:42.150
and with your permission,

29:42.151 --> 29:45.783
I would like to do
an m.R.I. On Henry.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.085
Test me.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.157
I want to help Joe.

29:49.158 --> 29:50.859
It's not up to you, sweetie.

29:50.860 --> 29:51.920
G-Go back.

29:51.921 --> 29:53.121
Finish the napkins. Go.

29:53.122 --> 29:54.923
Go.

29:54.924 --> 29:56.024
(Indistinct conversations)

29:56.025 --> 29:58.967
I have power of
attorney over my brother.

29:58.968 --> 30:00.829
And it is my job to protect him.

30:00.830 --> 30:01.930
My answer is no.

30:01.931 --> 30:03.832
Don't pretend to care
about Henry, okay?

30:03.833 --> 30:05.874
This is about
covering Anthony's ass.

30:05.875 --> 30:07.005
How dare you.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.806
Listen, lady, you have a
real shot at helping Henry,

30:08.807 --> 30:10.879
and you're just pissing that
away. A-All right, enough.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.041
Enough. We all want the
same thing here, don't we,

30:13.042 --> 30:15.084
to find out who killed Joe?

30:16.916 --> 30:19.988
I can help Henry. Let me do it.

30:19.989 --> 30:21.019
No.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.191
I trusted you once,

30:23.192 --> 30:25.193
and you came after my family.

30:25.194 --> 30:28.958
And no promise of a medical
miracle is gonna change that.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.860
Now it's just the four of us.

30:31.861 --> 30:34.903
And we have to
keep this place going,

30:34.904 --> 30:36.134
make sure that we
don't have to sell

30:36.135 --> 30:38.206
to that barracuda in a dress.

30:38.207 --> 30:40.869
We gotta make this place work.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.941
That's what Joe would want.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.012
Now you get out.

30:44.013 --> 30:47.016
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

30:52.051 --> 30:54.853
Bye-bye, Alice.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.057
(People speaking indistinctly)

30:59.058 --> 31:00.929
What is going on with you?

31:00.930 --> 31:02.060
They're just circling the wagons

31:02.061 --> 31:03.861
'cause they know
Anthony is guilty as hell.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.965
No, what is going on with you?

31:09.038 --> 31:11.139
(Exhales deeply) I
met my birth father.

31:11.140 --> 31:12.870
Oh.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.872
Yeah, I let Dani
push me into it.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.005
Oh?

31:18.207 --> 31:22.110
Oh...

31:22.111 --> 31:23.881
You and Dani.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.883
Yes, me and Dani.

31:25.884 --> 31:26.985
I'm sorry. I should've
said something...

31:26.986 --> 31:28.156
No, no, it's fine.
It's... it's... no.

31:28.157 --> 31:29.217
It's great. It's great.

31:29.218 --> 31:31.089
She's really smart,
and you needed a push,

31:31.090 --> 31:33.261
and... well, a shove actually,
so, hey, I should thank her.

31:33.262 --> 31:36.925
But it was a very bad idea.

31:36.926 --> 31:38.226
Why? What happened?

31:38.227 --> 31:40.228
Long story short, it just wasn't

31:40.229 --> 31:43.031
the happy ending I'd hoped for.

31:43.032 --> 31:45.033
Well, at least you
know the truth.

31:45.034 --> 31:49.077
And believe me, that's...
Much better than not knowing.

31:49.078 --> 31:51.279
Then why does it feel
like it was a huge mistake?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.241
Because you did
something really hard.

31:53.242 --> 31:55.244
That doesn't make it a mistake.

31:58.247 --> 32:00.918
(Sighs)

32:00.919 --> 32:02.991
No luck identifying
the bacteria?

32:02.992 --> 32:05.023
No, not yet.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.125
It's like the
Terminator of bacteria.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.097
And I mean, it's got a
wide range of temperatures,

32:09.098 --> 32:10.959
both hot and cold.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.061
The lab accidentally
irradiated one of the cultures,

32:13.062 --> 32:14.232
and it still wouldn't die.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.264
It's not a normal
human pathogen.

32:16.265 --> 32:18.236
Sounds like an extremophile.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.938
And if you can't identify
it in the usual ways,

32:20.939 --> 32:22.971
think outside the lab.

32:22.972 --> 32:24.042
(Both) D.N.A. Sequencing.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.173
Yeah, I said it first.

32:25.174 --> 32:28.046
Aren't you brilliant?

32:28.047 --> 32:30.118
What the hell did you
say to Maria sanella?

32:30.119 --> 32:32.280
I asked for her
consent to test Henry.

32:32.281 --> 32:35.323
She said no. So
much for my charm.

32:35.324 --> 32:37.185
Henry's in the emergency room.

32:37.186 --> 32:38.987
Why? What happened?

32:38.988 --> 32:40.288
He overdosed on
his Alzheimer's meds

32:40.289 --> 32:42.290
because he thought it would
help him remember Joe's killer.

32:42.291 --> 32:43.961
The problem is,

32:43.962 --> 32:45.963
he kept forgetting how
many pills he'd taken.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.036
Oh, god. He did that to help me.

32:48.037 --> 32:50.268
I'm gonna go see
him. The hell you are.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.070
Maria's threatening
to sue the m.E.'S office

32:52.071 --> 32:54.102
because she says you
put the idea in his head.

32:54.103 --> 32:56.074
M-Megan, stay away from them.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.247
(Singsongy) I am going.

33:06.655 --> 33:08.056
(Siren wails)

33:08.057 --> 33:11.059
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

33:11.060 --> 33:15.063
(Indistinct conversations)

33:15.064 --> 33:18.066
If you're here to talk me
out of suing your office,

33:18.067 --> 33:19.167
don't bother.

33:19.168 --> 33:21.029
Sue away. I'm here for Henry.

33:21.030 --> 33:22.630
I would like you to leave.

33:22.631 --> 33:25.002
Don't be rude, Maria.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.174
It's Alice.

33:26.175 --> 33:28.776
Let her stay.

33:28.777 --> 33:31.679
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:31.680 --> 33:34.682
Can you tell me what happened
when Henry had the seizure?

33:34.683 --> 33:36.744
We were in the kitchen.

33:36.745 --> 33:39.187
He just collapsed and
hit his head on the counter

33:39.188 --> 33:40.648
before I could reach him.

33:40.649 --> 33:42.090
They do a C.T. scan?

33:42.091 --> 33:44.652
It'll help us know if there's
any damage from the fall.

33:44.653 --> 33:46.624
Yes.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.197
(Beeping continues)

33:49.198 --> 33:52.029
You look a lot like her.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.102
Alice, I mean.

33:54.103 --> 33:55.763
She could always calm him.

33:55.764 --> 33:59.767
When we're scared, our mind
goes to happier memories.

33:59.768 --> 34:02.070
(Beeping continues)

34:02.071 --> 34:04.142
Soon, he won't even have that.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.043
(Beeping continues)

34:06.044 --> 34:09.677
Hmm. He wet his bed.

34:09.678 --> 34:13.181
(People speaking indistinctly)

34:13.182 --> 34:15.052
(Man) The C.T. scan's clean.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.125
And I have some great news.

34:17.126 --> 34:19.056
Henry doesn't have
Alzheimer's disease.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.659
He has normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.060
That's right.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.062
It's caused by
excess spinal fluid

34:25.063 --> 34:27.735
putting pressure on the brain,
but how did you know that?

34:27.736 --> 34:29.066
Because I'm a
doctor, and he shows

34:29.067 --> 34:30.738
the classic three
w's of N.P.H...

34:30.739 --> 34:32.140
Weird, wet, wobbly.

34:32.141 --> 34:35.143
Dementia, leaky bladder,
and distinct shuffling gait.

34:35.144 --> 34:36.704
Ugh.

34:36.705 --> 34:38.746
N.P.H. is a very
tricky diagnosis.

34:38.747 --> 34:41.109
The dementia's often
mistaken for Alzheimer's,

34:41.110 --> 34:43.781
the gait for Parkinson's,
but Henry has neither.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.114
Wait. What are you saying?

34:46.115 --> 34:47.715
Well, with your
permission, it's treatable

34:47.716 --> 34:50.718
with a 45-minute shunt
procedure to drain the excess fluid.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.089
(Beeping continues)

34:52.090 --> 34:54.162
You mean, Henry
could be normal again?

34:54.163 --> 34:55.223
It's certainly possible.

34:55.224 --> 34:56.794
Well, everybody
responds differently,

34:56.795 --> 34:59.827
but... let's hope
for the best, okay?

34:59.828 --> 35:01.729
Okay.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.701
Let's give it a try.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.174
(Beeping continues)

35:06.175 --> 35:08.136
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

35:08.137 --> 35:10.738
She's beautiful.

35:10.739 --> 35:12.280
Her name was Katie.

35:12.281 --> 35:16.214
(People speaking indistinctly)

35:16.215 --> 35:18.247
I see you in her.

35:28.757 --> 35:29.827
Ethan, hey, uh, we're...

35:29.828 --> 35:30.898
It's cool.

35:30.899 --> 35:33.761
Um, uh, d.N.A.
Sequencing scored huge.

35:33.762 --> 35:35.163
You've identified the bug?

35:35.164 --> 35:37.835
Yes, yes. A particularly
resilient one, too.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.738
Uh, deinococcus radiodurans.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.740
I called it the Terminator,
but in the medical community,

35:42.741 --> 35:44.842
it's known as "conan
the bacterium."

35:44.843 --> 35:47.144
Uh, it uses rich
organic materials

35:47.145 --> 35:48.846
like food and feces to grow,

35:48.847 --> 35:50.278
and it's most
commonly found in...

35:50.279 --> 35:51.819
Compost.

35:51.820 --> 35:53.281
That's what gave you away.

35:53.282 --> 35:55.323
What are you talking about?

35:55.324 --> 35:59.227
I found a chunk of
sausage in Joe's upper lung

35:59.228 --> 36:01.229
that was covered
with a kind of bacteria

36:01.230 --> 36:03.891
that thrives on compost.

36:03.892 --> 36:05.893
Joe inhaled it from
the hand of his killer.

36:05.894 --> 36:08.896
So we asked ourselves
who had access to compost,

36:08.897 --> 36:11.299
and the dots
connected back to you.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.771
Well, you were at
that organic farm.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.903
Plenty of compost there.

36:15.904 --> 36:17.945
Yeah, I went.

36:17.946 --> 36:19.907
So did Anthony and Maria.

36:19.908 --> 36:22.310
Yeah, but that was
after the murder.

36:22.311 --> 36:23.911
I called the farm, caren.

36:23.912 --> 36:26.854
You were the only one there
the day before the murder,

36:26.855 --> 36:29.257
all alone.

36:29.258 --> 36:30.888
You guys are crazy.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.960
(Chuckles) You
know what I think?

36:32.961 --> 36:35.923
I think that you and
Anthony sacrificed a lot

36:35.924 --> 36:37.325
by moving to Philly...

36:37.326 --> 36:38.926
Your jobs, your lives...

36:38.927 --> 36:41.198
But Henry needed
you, so you came.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.930
Yes, to support my husband.

36:42.931 --> 36:44.232
Right.

36:44.233 --> 36:45.873
But it wasn't just Henry

36:45.874 --> 36:47.275
that needed Anthony
back in Philly.

36:47.276 --> 36:49.907
It was Joe, too, to
help run sanella's.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.879
And being stuck there

36:51.880 --> 36:54.912
was Anthony's idea of hell.

36:54.913 --> 36:58.816
I bet that Anthony didn't
have the guts to confront Joe,

36:58.817 --> 37:01.319
so you took those
specs and went yourself.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.851
If you want
something done right...

37:03.852 --> 37:06.394
Anthony didn't kill Joe.

37:06.395 --> 37:07.996
You did.

37:09.998 --> 37:12.229
I told Joe that
selling the restaurant

37:12.230 --> 37:15.002
was the best
thing for the family.

37:15.003 --> 37:18.866
We could all have our own lives.

37:18.867 --> 37:21.339
Henry could get better care.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.972
You know what he said to me?

37:24.973 --> 37:28.916
"You will never be part
of this family, caren."

37:28.917 --> 37:32.320
After all that I had done,

37:32.321 --> 37:34.922
all the sacrifice...

37:34.923 --> 37:39.327
I grabbed the tenderizer,
and I just lost it.

37:39.328 --> 37:40.858
Lost it?

37:40.859 --> 37:43.862
You cracked him on
the head with it, right?

37:46.395 --> 37:47.935
Yes.

37:47.936 --> 37:48.996
Then you heard Henry,

37:48.997 --> 37:51.869
and you dragged
Joe into the freezer.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.271
By the time he left...

37:54.272 --> 37:55.943
Joe was dead.

37:55.944 --> 37:58.275
No, caren.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.277
He wasn't.

38:00.278 --> 38:04.011
It took Joe over two
hours to freeze to death.

38:04.012 --> 38:07.356
You still had time to save him.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.434
My mother told me...

38:26.435 --> 38:29.307
You could always
count on your family.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.482
(Crying) But what
if you lose them?

38:34.483 --> 38:37.915
What do you do then?

38:37.916 --> 38:39.046
You go on.

38:39.047 --> 38:41.449
(Sobs)

38:41.450 --> 38:44.322
I'm not sure I know how.

38:46.455 --> 38:48.457
I have faith in you, Maria.

38:50.058 --> 38:51.460
Joe would, too.

39:30.499 --> 39:32.370
(Elevator bell dings)

39:36.144 --> 39:38.976
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

39:38.977 --> 39:41.409
(Sighs)

39:41.410 --> 39:43.481
How are they holding up?

39:43.482 --> 39:44.982
Mm.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.454
Joe was the heart
and soul of that family,

39:46.455 --> 39:49.056
and caren took it
away from them.

39:49.057 --> 39:51.088
They could use a break.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.460
(Kate whispers) Yeah.

39:52.461 --> 39:54.462
On the way over here,

39:54.463 --> 39:57.465
"rocket man" was
playing on the radio.

39:57.466 --> 39:59.396
(Normal voice) It's a good song.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.999
Couldn't listen to it for years.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.532
Why not?

40:05.103 --> 40:07.074
It was playing

40:07.075 --> 40:09.406
on my father's car radio

40:09.407 --> 40:11.479
the day that he drove
my mother and me

40:11.480 --> 40:14.411
into New York City.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.543
It was a great trip...

40:15.544 --> 40:19.086
Shopping at bonwit teller's,

40:19.087 --> 40:22.419
Russian tea room, Broadway.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.493
I was really happy.

40:25.494 --> 40:27.024
(Siren wails)

40:27.025 --> 40:29.156
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

40:29.157 --> 40:31.530
It's the last time we
were together as a family.

40:34.563 --> 40:37.466
The next week,
my father was dead.

40:40.609 --> 40:42.169
(Chuckles)

40:42.170 --> 40:45.513
And every time I hear
that song on the radio,

40:45.514 --> 40:50.147
I am 12 years old again and...

40:50.148 --> 40:52.179
(Sighs deeply)

40:52.180 --> 40:54.582
Man, it still hurts.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.524
It's funny how the
brain works, right?

40:56.525 --> 40:57.585
Yeah.

40:57.586 --> 41:01.458
But, you know...

41:01.459 --> 41:04.632
(Voice breaking) I would
never want to forget that pain.

41:04.633 --> 41:07.464
It makes me who I am, you know?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.567
(Siren wailing)

41:09.568 --> 41:11.468
I can't imagine...

41:11.469 --> 41:14.602
Losing that.

41:14.603 --> 41:16.544
(Grunts)

41:16.545 --> 41:18.546
(Maria) Henry?

41:18.547 --> 41:21.078
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

41:21.079 --> 41:22.149
Can you hear us?

41:22.150 --> 41:23.651
(Beeping continues)

41:23.652 --> 41:26.213
Alice.

41:26.214 --> 41:28.516
The confusion's normal.

41:28.517 --> 41:31.488
We'll know more
in a couple of hours.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.221
Dr. Hunt reminds me
so much of your mother.

41:34.222 --> 41:35.262
Dad?

41:35.263 --> 41:36.524
Oh, my god. (Cries)

41:36.525 --> 41:38.566
I'm okay, son.

41:38.567 --> 41:40.628
I'm okay.

41:40.629 --> 41:43.200
Listen, the restaurant...

41:43.201 --> 41:45.172
Nah, don't worry
about that, dad.

41:45.173 --> 41:47.174
I'm gonna stay with you now.

41:47.175 --> 41:49.106
We'll run it together, okay?

41:49.107 --> 41:50.277
No.

41:50.278 --> 41:53.641
Your uncle Joe
and I built sanella's.

41:53.642 --> 41:57.284
It was our dream, not yours.

41:57.285 --> 41:59.286
Maria and I will run it,

41:59.287 --> 42:00.688
won't we?

42:00.689 --> 42:02.249
For Joe.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.652
You bet we will.

42:04.653 --> 42:06.624
For Joe.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.126
(Beeping continues)

42:09.127 --> 42:11.198
Dr. Hunt.

42:11.199 --> 42:12.630
Thank you.

42:12.631 --> 42:15.532
(Beeping continues)

42:15.533 --> 42:17.665
You didn't give up on me.

42:17.666 --> 42:19.536
(Beeping continues)

42:19.537 --> 42:22.140
Wasn't an option.
