Previously on E. R.

00:06.487 --> 00:09.602
Who's that?
- Susan Lewis. We're supposed to have lunch.

00:09.837 --> 00:11.686
You didn't say anything
about having a lunch.

00:11.687 --> 00:13.889
If you want the Chief Residency its yours.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.139
Jackie, it's Peter.
If you're there, pick up!

00:16.140 --> 00:18.879
Hey Roger, it's Peter.
I need you to pick up Reece from school.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.815
I found her. It's your mother.

00:21.216 --> 00:23.417
It's that breast milk?
You're contaminated. Scrub out.

00:23.418 --> 00:24.464
Â¡Okay!

00:24.565 --> 00:27.558
- What do you want me to do, Rachel?
- You could let me stay here.

00:27.559 --> 00:28.967
It's a big move.

00:28.968 --> 00:30.768
Do you guys have a satellite dish?

00:31.169 --> 00:33.955
- But you're not winning me over.
- I signed you up for Tuesday

00:33.956 --> 00:34.956
You're serious?

00:40.545 --> 00:43.749
Yeah, it's-
No, it's my pager number.

00:43.924 --> 00:46.878
Yes. Dr. Kerry Weaver.

00:47.052 --> 00:52.955
No. It's nothing serious. I just have
some personal information for her.

00:53.685 --> 00:55.643
- All right. Thank you.
- Good morning.

00:55.813 --> 00:57.604
Good morning. You all set?

00:57.774 --> 01:01.819
Oh, yeah. I forgot how jammed
the El can be during rush hour.

01:02.154 --> 01:07.659
- Is there any chance I could get a locker?
- Oh, sure. Fourth to the right.

01:07.827 --> 01:09.571
I'll have them take the name off.

01:11.247 --> 01:13.573
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

01:19.049 --> 01:21.587
Watch out! Coming through!

01:21.760 --> 01:24.251
- I heard it, but I didn't believe it.
- Malik!

01:24.430 --> 01:26.090
Oh, we missed you!

01:26.266 --> 01:28.591
They actually talked you into
coming back here.

01:28.769 --> 01:30.393
- Bad idea?
- I didn't say that.

01:30.562 --> 01:33.599
Frank, call Housekeeping.
Someone took a dump in Exam 2.

01:33.774 --> 01:37.903
- Hey, Frank, our mad crapper's back, huh?
- If I catch him, he'll be pooping in a bag.

01:38.070 --> 01:39.862
- What happened to the board?
- Weaver.

01:40.032 --> 01:43.572
Spanky's in Curtain 3 complaining
of incontinence. I'm not touching him.

01:43.744 --> 01:45.903
- I'll take him.
- I don't think you want that.

01:46.080 --> 01:49.323
- Here. Leg injury, Curtain 1.
- Welcome back, Dr. L.

01:49.501 --> 01:51.707
Thanks. What's the story with Spanky?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.548
He likes nurses. A lot.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.004
- Dr. Lewis? Are you Susan Lewis?
- Yes.

01:58.178 --> 02:00.187
Cleo Finch,
the Senior on nights this week.

02:00.263 --> 02:01.243
Nice to meet you.

02:01.315 --> 02:03.323
- I have a few pass-ons.
- Okay.

02:03.392 --> 02:07.643
Curtain 3, worst headache of his life.
Do a spinal tap if the head CT is negative.

02:07.814 --> 02:10.519
- Okay. No problem.
- Well, well, well.

02:10.692 --> 02:12.982
- Dr. Susan Lewis.
- Dr. Benton.

02:13.154 --> 02:15.146
Just when I thought it was safe
to come in.

02:15.322 --> 02:17.446
- I missed you too, Peter.
- I know.

02:18.493 --> 02:20.071
So can I buy you breakfast?

02:20.245 --> 02:24.244
I just got here, but you can
get me lunch. Oh, sorry.

02:24.417 --> 02:26.326
I have to sign out
and get to Schaumburg.

02:26.502 --> 02:28.412
- Another interview?
- No, the job's mine.

02:28.589 --> 02:31.839
- Meeting the medical director today.
- Congratulations.

02:32.009 --> 02:33.634
Nosebleed in Suture's got Merocel.

02:33.803 --> 02:36.045
Check on him.
Wear a mask, he's a spitter.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.966
Right. Are you going somewhere?

02:38.141 --> 02:41.842
I've been offered the chance to run
a pediatric urgent care. Five doctors...

02:42.020 --> 02:44.594
- ... eight-hour shifts, no overnights.
- Yeah, but it's...

02:44.774 --> 02:46.351
- What?
- ... in Schaumburg.

02:46.526 --> 02:50.109
It's 40 minutes away.
IV drug user with a shooter's abscess.

02:50.281 --> 02:53.317
Whisked off to Echo
before I could drain him.

02:53.493 --> 02:54.608
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

02:54.786 --> 02:57.027
They just brought in a homeless lady
with maggots.

02:57.205 --> 02:59.875
I'd see her before
they start crawling away.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.032
Thanks.

03:02.002 --> 03:05.454
- Mark, can you get the water?
- Did you see my vertigo notes?

03:05.631 --> 03:06.877
- I got it.
- What?

03:07.050 --> 03:10.796
- My vertigo notes. They were right here.
- We need to leave in 10 minutes.

03:10.971 --> 03:14.305
- I'm ready, as soon as I find my notes.
- When did you last have them?

03:14.475 --> 03:16.183
- Last night.
- That will be fun.

03:16.353 --> 03:19.188
Okay, hold on.
Dad, can I go to a party tonight?

03:19.356 --> 03:21.313
- It's a school night.
- Something's burning.

03:21.484 --> 03:23.358
Just for dinner. It's Claire's birthday.

03:23.528 --> 03:25.735
- Who's Claire?
- A girl from school.

03:26.323 --> 03:28.399
Sorry. Do you want some cereal
or something?

03:28.575 --> 03:30.449
- No. I'll get something later.
- Dad?

03:30.619 --> 03:32.992
- Let me talk to her mother.
- Is your mom there?

03:33.164 --> 03:34.991
Mark, I have an 8:00 thyroidectomy.

03:35.166 --> 03:39.164
Hi, this is Mark Greene. Yeah,
Rachel's dad. I just was wanting to...

03:39.337 --> 03:43.253
- So how did you meet Claire?
- She's my partner in art class.

03:44.594 --> 03:46.338
What are you working on?

03:46.513 --> 03:48.552
Call me after dinner
and I'll pick you up.

03:49.266 --> 03:50.926
Cool.

03:51.894 --> 03:53.722
- Katherine's early.
- Good.

03:54.356 --> 03:56.644
Gonna need to get dressed in the car.

03:56.817 --> 03:59.023
- Hi. Is Rachel ready?
- Who are you?

03:59.194 --> 04:01.103
This is Andrew.
He's driving me to school.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.115
- Nice to meet you.
- Here are your notes. Dining-room table.

04:04.284 --> 04:06.776
- When did this happen?
- Oh, sorry, I forgot.

04:06.954 --> 04:09.410
Andrew has a car
while his dad's out of town.

04:09.581 --> 04:12.453
- You have a license?
- Yeah. Well, I got it in June.

04:12.627 --> 04:16.127
- I have no accidents, you know.
- We can take you to school.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.168
No, no, it's good.
Now you guys won't be late for work.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.738
Well, I guess she's making friends.

05:14.457 --> 05:18.289
- I don't like taking my clothes off.
- You have to if you want to be examined.

05:18.462 --> 05:22.328
Can't you just listen to my stomach?
I think something's, like, blown loose.

05:22.506 --> 05:25.507
- It keeps making these weird noises.
- Maybe you're hungry.

05:25.676 --> 05:27.668
And maybe I'm bleeding into my belly.

05:27.844 --> 05:30.217
Could it be a complication
from my surgery?

05:30.389 --> 05:32.465
I don't know.
My x-ray vision isn't working.

05:32.641 --> 05:34.301
- Are you mocking me?
- No.

05:34.477 --> 05:37.346
- It sounds like you're mocking me.
- I'm taking you seriously...

05:37.521 --> 05:40.356
...which is why I'll examine you
as soon as you get undressed.

05:40.524 --> 05:42.730
- You just wanna see me naked.
- I want to examine you.

05:42.901 --> 05:46.851
Yeah, examine me naked. Can I get
a male doctor in here? A straight one?

05:47.030 --> 05:49.069
First day of school,
already making friends?

05:49.198 --> 05:51.689
- I'm a shoo-in for homecoming queen.
- So far, so good.

05:51.867 --> 05:56.031
Oh, yeah. Foul abscess,
a neurotic granny, naked boy here.

05:56.204 --> 05:57.996
And I had to break into Chen's locker.

05:58.165 --> 06:00.572
- Did you steal her stuff?
- Weaver gave it to me.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.502
What are you using for maggots
these days? Cetacaine?

06:03.670 --> 06:06.042
Good thought,
but Kerry's immune to it.

06:06.214 --> 06:08.123
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

06:08.216 --> 06:11.217
Colonel Dixon's Magical Maggot Mix.

06:11.385 --> 06:13.841
Seriously, you paint it on with milk.

06:14.013 --> 06:17.715
Paramedic radios over this. Dr. Greene
and Dr. Lewis, two of our Attendings.

06:17.892 --> 06:20.928
Welcome. Don't kill anyone.
And I'll mix you up a fresh batch.

06:21.104 --> 06:24.687
Dr. Lewis is a wealth of medical knowledge,
but don't ask her where anything is.

06:24.857 --> 06:28.307
She is just getting re-oriented
after a five-year sabbatical herself.

06:28.485 --> 06:29.599
Five years?

06:29.777 --> 06:31.421
- Posttraumatic stress.
- What happened?

06:31.496 --> 06:34.780
You don't wanna know.
Fill these out and then come find me.

06:34.950 --> 06:37.784
- Do you have a pen?
- Come prepared. Want the tour?

06:37.953 --> 06:41.202
I think I can find my way around again.
New group of neophytes?

06:41.372 --> 06:44.575
- Yeah, I get to babysit them too.
- It's the burden of being Chief Resident.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.328
- You've heard?
- Yes, I have.

06:46.501 --> 06:49.040
Oh, nurse? Nurse? Nurse?

06:49.213 --> 06:51.371
- Are you talking to me?
- I don't know your name.

06:51.548 --> 06:54.217
You haven't met Abby yet.
Abby Lockhart, Dr. Susan Lewis.

06:54.384 --> 06:57.551
- Susan, Abby. Susan used to work here.
- That's the rumor.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.844
Could you set me up
for suturing in Exam 3?

07:00.015 --> 07:01.674
- Set you up?
- Open a kit...

07:01.850 --> 07:04.222
...some 4-0 nylon,
number-seven gloves, Betadine.

07:04.394 --> 07:07.476
- It's all in the room. New chest pain in 2.
- Altered LOC over here!

07:07.646 --> 07:11.146
Hey, Mooney. Get started on the
chest pain here. You know the routine.

07:11.317 --> 07:13.226
Oxygen, aspirin, nitro times three.

07:13.318 --> 07:14.350
I can't believe you're back.

07:14.528 --> 07:16.604
- You look great!
- So do you. I love your hair.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.903
Hey, my brother could be dying here.

07:19.074 --> 07:21.067
- Ready, steady, lift.
- No response to Narcan.

07:21.243 --> 07:23.531
We were just talking.
That's it, talking.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.621
- Is he taking any medications?
- Not that he's told me about.

07:26.790 --> 07:30.740
Lack of disconjugate gaze and conjugate
deviation rules out a structural lesion.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.873
CBC, chem panel, 12-lead,
tox screen and a head CT.

07:34.047 --> 07:36.418
- Did he have a stroke?
- It's too early to say.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.815
The abrupt onset suggests
CNS bleed, seizure,

07:39.870 --> 07:41.584
even cardiopulmonary anoxia.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.218
- Pulse ox is 99.
- Don't let him die.

07:44.390 --> 07:45.635
No tremor...

07:45.808 --> 07:49.259
...asterixis or myoclonus, suggestive
of a metabolic encephalopathy.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.262
I'm trying to listen.

07:51.438 --> 07:55.021
- You want a portable chest?
- Ask Professor Carter.

07:55.191 --> 07:58.145
- How would you describe your pain?
- It hurts.

07:58.319 --> 08:00.774
Is it stabbing? Burning? Tearing?

08:00.864 --> 08:03.105
What's the freaking difference?

08:03.825 --> 08:08.118
Okay. I'm gonna give you some medicine
under your tongue.

08:09.121 --> 08:10.663
And open.

08:11.373 --> 08:13.496
- Let me know if it's better.
- Three sprays?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.624
- Yeah. Nitro times three.
- At once?

08:15.794 --> 08:17.453
I don't feel good. What's happening?

08:17.629 --> 08:19.788
I'm gonna put your head down
for a minute.

08:19.965 --> 08:21.459
- I feel so dizzy.
- What?

08:21.633 --> 08:23.625
- Everything's blurry.
- Okay.

08:23.801 --> 08:27.419
You're gonna feel a little bit
more oxygen flowing through your nose.

08:27.596 --> 08:30.218
- How's the pain in your chest?
- Worse.

08:30.391 --> 08:32.549
-80/60.
- Is it bad?

08:32.726 --> 08:35.477
- No, just a little bit low.
- Was that the wrong medicine?

08:35.645 --> 08:38.219
No, everything's okay.
This just happens sometimes.

08:38.398 --> 08:41.150
Dr. Mooney is one of our best.

08:41.318 --> 08:43.808
- I'll go write my note.
- Yeah, do that.

08:45.239 --> 08:48.358
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- It's in the differential.

08:48.533 --> 08:51.202
- Where did you come up with that?
- Photographic memory.

08:51.369 --> 08:54.820
And I delivered a lecture on coma
last week.

08:54.997 --> 08:56.373
- Ridiculous.
- What?

08:56.540 --> 08:59.707
Time. Yesterday it seems
you couldn't start an IV.

08:59.877 --> 09:01.750
- It was longer than yesterday.
- Carter.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.498
- Yeah?
- Mooney saw my patient.

09:03.672 --> 09:06.424
- What'd you tell him about nitro?
- The basics. Three sprays.

09:06.592 --> 09:10.008
- Three sprays. That's right.
- All at once?

09:10.262 --> 09:12.883
- No, you give them every five minutes.
- You left that out.

09:13.098 --> 09:16.217
- How's his pressure?
- Zero over zero. He's dead.

09:16.726 --> 09:18.684
I'm kidding.

09:19.353 --> 09:22.520
I pulled him through. Keep a short leash
on your students, huh?

09:22.690 --> 09:25.607
- All clear.
- I'm gonna go check on this guy.

09:25.776 --> 09:28.350
- You got this?
- Yeah, I think so.

09:28.695 --> 09:29.976
Did you see him get hit?

09:30.155 --> 09:33.773
No. I went to return the shopping cart
and he was just laying by the car.

09:35.869 --> 09:37.862
- What do you got?
- Weak pulse, shallow resps.

09:38.038 --> 09:39.532
- What's your dad's name?
- Alan.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.533
Alan, can you open your eyes?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.866
- GCS is 2-4-5.
- Is he waking up?

09:44.460 --> 09:45.789
Not just yet.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.458
Mark, look at this.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.215
We need a backboard.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.735
Blood count's normal. Chemistry's okay.

09:55.821 --> 09:57.881
Nothing on the tox screen.

09:58.057 --> 10:00.761
- All of his labs look good.
- Why is he still in a coma?

10:00.935 --> 10:03.390
How much longer up there?

10:04.688 --> 10:07.439
- Has he ever seen a psychiatrist?
- I don't think so.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.227
Sorry.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.237
Coming through!
Need a portable chest and pelvic.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.657
Your brother has signs
of psychogenic coma.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.573
- What's that?
- When we open his eyelids, they flutter.

10:22.747 --> 10:26.578
He responds to a Q-Tip in the nose.
I don't think it's a real coma.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.491
What do you mean, he's faking?

10:30.045 --> 10:33.959
What about the shaking and the frothing
at the mouth and everything?

10:34.132 --> 10:36.753
I'd like to get a psychiatric consultation.

10:36.926 --> 10:41.173
Yeah, yeah. That would be great. He has
been under a lot of pressure lately.

10:41.347 --> 10:44.348
- Hey, what's taking so long?
- You're still dressed?

10:44.934 --> 10:47.259
- We'll move him to a quieter room.
- Great.

10:47.436 --> 10:50.769
Do you have a gown? I could catch cold.
It's bad enough I'm bleeding out.

10:50.939 --> 10:53.181
Go back to your bed.
The nurse will bring one.

10:53.359 --> 10:55.315
How long until
the psychiatrist gets here?

10:55.486 --> 10:56.730
I'll let you know.

10:56.903 --> 10:59.988
Can I just talk to my surgeon?
British chick, red hair.

11:00.156 --> 11:01.567
Will you shut up?!

11:02.533 --> 11:05.451
- Systolic's up to 100.
- Let's roll him. Set up the SonoSite.

11:05.619 --> 11:08.289
- Cross for 6.
- Large abrasions to the back.

11:08.455 --> 11:11.659
Did the car crush him against something?

11:11.834 --> 11:14.289
- I didn't see.
- Tracey...?

11:14.462 --> 11:16.620
- Daddy?
- Sir, you're in a hospital.

11:16.797 --> 11:20.130
- Do you know what the date is?
- Daddy, I'm so sorry.

11:20.301 --> 11:22.507
- You didn't see me.
- Alan?

11:22.678 --> 11:24.966
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

11:25.138 --> 11:27.047
- Sorry for what?
- Were you in the car?

11:28.808 --> 11:31.595
- I'm sorry.
- Looks like a liver lac.

11:31.769 --> 11:33.561
- I'll go get her.
- Let's intubate.

11:33.646 --> 11:35.075
Etomidate and sux.

11:35.147 --> 11:39.097
- Where were you stationed?
- In Birmingham.

11:39.318 --> 11:43.731
- I have an uncle in Birmingham.
- Does he work in the steel mills?

11:43.906 --> 11:45.982
The university.

11:46.158 --> 11:49.941
We handled mail for 7 million soldiers.

11:50.120 --> 11:54.034
Sixty-five thousand pieces
every eight hours.

11:54.207 --> 11:59.498
- My goodness.
- Nothing beats a letter from home.

12:02.173 --> 12:03.797
What do you think?

12:03.967 --> 12:07.382
It's a perforation.
A small hole in the colon.

12:07.678 --> 12:10.429
It's from her diverticular disease.

12:10.598 --> 12:13.551
I'm afraid you'll need an operation
to fix it.

12:13.725 --> 12:16.845
Is that really necessary? She's so weak.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.688
It's really the only option.

12:19.856 --> 12:22.014
Can't we wait a few days?

12:22.192 --> 12:25.690
Then she'll become extremely ill,
and surgery could be dangerous.

12:25.862 --> 12:29.941
If I were your mother, would you
recommend the operation?

12:31.367 --> 12:33.359
Absolutely.

12:33.535 --> 12:36.370
- Then we'll do it.
- Dr. Corday?

12:36.538 --> 12:39.742
I have a Mr. Ashman who says
you repaired his hernia.

12:39.916 --> 12:42.101
Chubby, drug-seeking hypochondriac?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.373
I don't know about drug seeking.
Complains of abdominal pain.

12:44.545 --> 12:47.084
- What's his exam like?
- Didn't do one.

12:47.257 --> 12:48.532
Then why
are you talking to me?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.792
Some surgeons
treat their patients primarily.

12:50.968 --> 12:54.586
- Not this one.
- Well, he's going to say he's tender.

12:54.763 --> 12:57.764
- You'll be seeing him eventually.
- Maybe, maybe not.

12:57.934 --> 13:00.887
- Oh, I'm pretty certain. Abby.
- Malik.

13:01.061 --> 13:02.888
- Who gets the vent?
- Curtain 3.

13:03.063 --> 13:04.094
I have to start a dopamine drip.

13:04.189 --> 13:06.645
Curtain 2, he's still fully clothed.

13:06.817 --> 13:09.652
- He needs a gown, don't you think?
- Sure.

13:10.778 --> 13:12.487
Stop!

13:13.115 --> 13:14.442
Somebody!

13:15.908 --> 13:18.446
- You thought you could fool me?
- Mr. Norden!

13:19.287 --> 13:21.326
Stop it! Security!

13:21.497 --> 13:24.831
You take a loan from Mr. Bennett,
he expects his money back.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.294
You pay it by Monday or next time
it's gonna be your head, you understand?

13:33.091 --> 13:36.543
I need a nurse in here.
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

13:36.720 --> 13:39.425
- He broke my legs.
- He's not your brother?

13:42.642 --> 13:47.884
- Would you like me to call your mom?
- No. No. It's just us.

13:49.482 --> 13:52.897
God, we were having
such a great day too.

13:53.444 --> 13:57.655
He took me out to lunch
because I got into law school.

13:57.823 --> 14:00.397
Early acceptance?

14:02.327 --> 14:03.951
He even...

14:04.121 --> 14:08.200
He even laminated a copy
of the letter to his toolbox.

14:10.793 --> 14:15.538
- What is that? What are they doing?
- They' re just taking x-rays.

14:16.007 --> 14:19.671
- Is something broken?
- He may have a crushed pelvis.

14:21.762 --> 14:26.803
- Is that really bad?
- Possibly. He might need surgery.

14:26.975 --> 14:28.635
God.

14:28.811 --> 14:33.804
He had to have been run over
or pinned against something.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.730
It was a wall.

14:42.907 --> 14:44.566
What?

14:47.745 --> 14:52.490
Look, I thought I was in reverse.

14:52.666 --> 14:57.742
It was such a tight space. He was
out front waiting for me to back out.

15:00.423 --> 15:03.042
I thought it was in reverse.

15:15.079 --> 15:18.325
- Mr. Stegman's troponin is positive.
- I sent Mooney to the library.

15:18.500 --> 15:23.921
- Good call. CPK on Norden.
- That's Susan's patient. Dr. Lewis.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.459
- Has she always been high-maintenance?
- She's not. She's great.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.461
- Could you get a rectal temp in Room 4?
- Anything else?

15:30.555 --> 15:32.632
- That should do it.
- I heard about your hit man.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.264
More like an enforcer.

15:35.436 --> 15:37.809
- Never a dull moment.
- I could use a dull moment.

15:37.981 --> 15:40.353
- Pick a chart. Any chart.
- This is a setup.

15:40.525 --> 15:42.649
No, just go ahead. Pick.

15:42.820 --> 15:45.027
- Are you sure?
- No.

15:46.366 --> 15:48.158
Female abdominal pain.
What did you get?

15:48.327 --> 15:49.572
Suture removal.

15:49.645 --> 15:51.655
- This is definitely a setup.
- On a scrotum.

15:51.731 --> 15:53.242
Maybe not.

15:53.416 --> 15:55.908
- All right, where is he?
- Who?

15:56.086 --> 15:58.162
Mr. Ashman. You paged for a consult.

15:58.338 --> 16:00.297
Curtain 2.
Epigastric tenderness on exam.

16:00.466 --> 16:03.717
- As predicted.
- Better hurry before he finds his clothes.

16:03.887 --> 16:06.841
Dr. Corday, there's a code in the SICU,
one of your patients.

16:07.016 --> 16:09.341
You'll have to keep him hidden.

16:12.689 --> 16:13.934
- Amal?
- Yes.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.274
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis. How long
have you had your stomach trouble?

16:17.445 --> 16:20.019
Since yesterday.
How long is this gonna take?

16:20.198 --> 16:22.191
I don't know.
It depends on what's wrong.

16:22.368 --> 16:26.662
Well, I need to be home in two hours,
no matter what.

16:26.831 --> 16:28.705
Pressure's good, 110/60.

16:28.875 --> 16:31.117
TKO the saline.
Send up the last two O-neg.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.667
- Is he okay?
- He's responding to blood transfusion.

16:33.839 --> 16:36.706
- But he needs surgery to repair his liver.
- Hold the elevator!

16:36.843 --> 16:39.880
- Can I go with him?
- Take her to the surgical waiting room.

16:40.055 --> 16:42.048
Wait right here,
I'll come back and get you.

16:42.224 --> 16:44.680
- You want one-shot IVP?
- We'll do it upstairs.

16:44.852 --> 16:46.726
- It's two-plus for heme.
- Got it.

16:46.897 --> 16:49.732
Dr. Greene?
Did you get a BAL on the daughter?

16:50.067 --> 16:53.353
I smelled alcohol on her breath.
A DUl with injury is a felony.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.570
- She wasn't driving.
- Now she says she was.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.898
- Did you get the CT? Radiology's waiting.
- Peter took him to the O.R.

16:59.077 --> 17:00.738
She's changing her story.

17:00.913 --> 17:04.579
- Did you smell alcohol on the daughter?
- I don't know. Maybe.

17:04.752 --> 17:07.836
- Are you arresting her?
- You can still draw a level.

17:08.005 --> 17:10.710
Give her a break.
Her father's in critical condition.

17:10.884 --> 17:13.041
Because she hit him
while under the influence.

17:13.303 --> 17:15.592
- Doesn't seem drunk to me.
- Forget it.

17:15.765 --> 17:18.256
I'll call a phlebotomist
from the station.

17:18.434 --> 17:21.935
You'll get your draw.
Just wait until her dad's out of surgery.

17:22.105 --> 17:23.731
- How long?
- A couple of hours.

17:23.898 --> 17:26.604
My sergeant wants me back
on the streets. I can't babysit.

17:26.778 --> 17:29.613
Well, come back.
She's not gonna go anywhere.

17:30.281 --> 17:32.073
Take your time and think it over.

17:32.243 --> 17:35.410
No, you don't understand.
I have to have an abortion.

17:35.580 --> 17:38.285
- You have other options, you know.
- No, not for me.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.950
My parents are so strict.

17:41.545 --> 17:45.247
- They'll kill me.
- Everybody thinks that.

17:45.425 --> 17:47.963
No, it's different for us.

17:48.553 --> 17:51.425
I have to be a virgin
on my wedding day.

17:51.599 --> 17:53.841
- I think if you give them the chance-
- No.

17:54.018 --> 17:57.055
If they find out that I've had sex...

17:57.230 --> 17:59.983
...I'm no longer their daughter.

18:00.151 --> 18:04.232
They'll send me away,
out of the country.

18:04.823 --> 18:08.489
And I don't want to live there. I can't.

18:09.245 --> 18:10.906
What?

18:12.540 --> 18:16.124
Do you know what
an ectopic pregnancy is?

18:16.336 --> 18:18.163
A miscarriage?

18:18.339 --> 18:22.552
Not exactly. It's where the fetus
grows in the fallopian tube.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.505
- So then I have to have an abortion.
- It's more complicated than that.

18:26.682 --> 18:28.723
- You'll need surgery.
- An operation?

18:28.893 --> 18:31.681
- Right now.
- Well, how long does it take?

18:32.481 --> 18:36.934
- You leave the hospital by tomorrow.
- I have to be home for dinner in an hour.

18:37.111 --> 18:40.612
If you don't have surgery,
it could rupture. You'll bleed to death.

18:40.782 --> 18:43.949
- Then I'll come back Saturday.
- You may not make it to Saturday.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.371
- I don't care.
- I need a doctor in Trauma 1 right now.

18:47.540 --> 18:51.159
Pregnancy is confidential.
We don't have to tell your parents.

18:51.336 --> 18:55.382
- Dr. Lewis, status epilepticus.
- You stay right there. I'll be right back.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.544
Amal, okay?

18:59.179 --> 19:01.753
Paramedics gave 4 of Ativan,
but she's still seizing.

19:01.933 --> 19:05.009
- How's the airway?
- Borderline. You may have to tube her.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.511
- Give another 2 of Ativan.
- Oh, you got this one?

19:07.690 --> 19:10.311
- Who are you?
- Susan Lewis. It's my first day.

19:10.485 --> 19:12.062
- Resident?
- Attending.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.147
Tachy at 130.

19:14.448 --> 19:16.239
- We'll do it together.
- Okay.

19:16.408 --> 19:19.031
- How long has she been seizing?
- Got the call 20 minutes ago.

19:19.204 --> 19:21.243
- Any history?
- Husband only speaks Spanish.

19:21.414 --> 19:24.914
- Okay, let's prep a gram of Dilantin.
- We should intubate.

19:26.253 --> 19:27.914
Go ahead.

19:28.089 --> 19:29.632
- Push 70 of Zemuron.
- What?

19:29.799 --> 19:32.635
- Rocuronium.
- I have to go to the pharmacy.

19:32.803 --> 19:37.928
- It's the best non-depolarizing agent.
- Maybe, but we don't stock it.

19:38.101 --> 19:40.771
Hundred of sux. I'll get the airway.

19:42.898 --> 19:44.179
Push the Dilantin.

19:46.903 --> 19:50.070
-360. Clear.
- Clear.

19:50.699 --> 19:52.573
- Still in fib.
- How long since Cordarone?

19:52.743 --> 19:55.032
- Twenty minutes.
-360 again. Give an amp of epi.

19:55.205 --> 19:57.875
- I just did.
- Trying to raise the dead, Lizzie?

19:58.041 --> 20:00.165
- Clear.
- Clear.

20:01.045 --> 20:03.880
Septic hemicolectomy.
Maxed out on dopamine and Levophed.

20:04.049 --> 20:05.958
- Asystole.
- Go directly to the morgue.

20:06.134 --> 20:10.797
- Do not pass "go. " Do not collect $200.
- Okay, that's it. I'll call the family.

20:10.973 --> 20:14.972
Not that I'm keeping score, but isn't this
your third post-op death this week?

20:15.729 --> 20:18.516
Congratulations.
We call that a hat trick.

20:20.151 --> 20:22.987
- Thousand of Dilantin onboard.
- Get ready with phenobarb.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.780
The husband.

20:24.948 --> 20:27.440
Sir, does your wife have epilepsy?

20:29.788 --> 20:32.825
- Can we get a translator?
- No, it's okay.

20:43.429 --> 20:46.217
She's on an anti-TB med. Isoniazid.

20:57.446 --> 20:58.940
- What?
- It's an overdose...

20:59.115 --> 21:00.822
...because the label is in English.

21:00.992 --> 21:05.204
It says, "Take once a day. " O-N-C-E.
In Spanish, that means 11.

21:05.372 --> 21:06.700
She took 11 pills a day?

21:06.873 --> 21:10.919
We need pyridoxine, at least 6 grams.
It's the only way we're gonna stop this.

21:11.128 --> 21:14.415
Check the blood gas. She'll need
an amplified carbon. She's acidemic.

21:19.805 --> 21:22.261
- Pavulon while we wait.
- What did you say?

21:22.892 --> 21:25.099
I said we'd help her.

21:26.939 --> 21:31.068
- I am diabetic. I need water.
- Well, then we'll start an IV for you.

21:31.945 --> 21:34.947
- I drink. I throw up. I feel better.
- No. Nothing to drink.

21:35.115 --> 21:38.568
You have gallstones
the size of golf balls.

21:39.746 --> 21:42.202
- I have "golf" stones?
- You have gallstones.

21:42.374 --> 21:44.533
- Can you start a line?
- How do you charge this?

21:44.710 --> 21:47.546
The crash cart. He's crashing.
Looks like V-tach.

21:47.714 --> 21:50.087
- Does he have a pulse?
- I don't think so.

21:51.385 --> 21:54.422
Charge to 200. Stanley, have you
ever shocked a patient before?

21:54.597 --> 21:56.222
- This one's all yours.
- That's okay.

21:56.391 --> 21:58.550
- I am right here.
- Charged and ready.

21:58.727 --> 22:02.856
Apply firm pressure. And before you
press the buttons, back off, say "clear. "

22:03.024 --> 22:05.230
Okay. Clear.

22:06.111 --> 22:07.605
Did you get shocked?

22:07.780 --> 22:10.271
You're supposed to say "clear" before,
not after.

22:10.449 --> 22:13.534
- Normal sinus rhythm! I've got a pulse!
- So does he, thank God.

22:13.703 --> 22:15.827
Were you touching the bed frame?
EKG lead?

22:15.998 --> 22:18.749
No. His arm right here.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.621
Hold on. I'll get you an ice pack.

22:21.796 --> 22:24.466
Feels like someone
kicked me in the chest.

22:24.633 --> 22:29.130
Well, consider yourself lucky,
Mr. Stegman.

22:33.476 --> 22:35.684
- How long has she been seizing?
- Almost an hour.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.480
Four grams of pyridoxine onboard.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.104
She needs 1 gram per gram ingested.
Give another 4.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.353
- We don't have another 4.
- Go to the pharmacy.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.858
- I can't.
- Send another nurse.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.941
This is all we have
in the whole hospital.

22:46.117 --> 22:48.870
Okay, send couriers to Mercy,
Northwestern, Parkside-

22:49.037 --> 22:50.496
Parkside closed last year.

22:50.664 --> 22:53.665
Every nearby hospital. We need
all the pyridoxine we can get.

22:53.835 --> 22:56.207
V- fib. Starting compressions.

22:56.379 --> 22:58.171
Charge to 200.

23:04.931 --> 23:07.387
- Daughter was driving?
- Crushed him against a wall.

23:07.559 --> 23:09.351
You wonder why I don't have kids.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.727
- Lizzie, what you got?
- Perfed diverticulum.

23:11.898 --> 23:15.018
Clean under your fingernails.
Don't want another post-op infection.

23:15.151 --> 23:17.025
Dr. Benton,
there's a Roger on the phone.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.227
He's in surgery.

23:18.406 --> 23:20.233
- Take a message.
- He says it's important.

23:20.408 --> 23:21.985
- Hold the phone.
- He's crashing!

23:22.160 --> 23:25.016
- Get four more units of packed cells!
- Good news can wait.

23:25.151 --> 23:28.325
- Bad news will never go away.
- Tell him I'll call him back.

23:28.501 --> 23:30.375
Hold compressions.

23:31.922 --> 23:34.247
- Asystole.
- Start pacing at 140.

23:34.425 --> 23:37.592
Courier's got pyridoxine from Mercy.
It'll be here in 10 minutes.

23:37.762 --> 23:39.470
Turn up the gain.

23:41.558 --> 23:44.595
- No capture.
- Resume compressions.

23:49.901 --> 23:54.730
- How long has she been down?
- No cardiac activity for 35 minutes.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.283
You want to keep going?

24:00.081 --> 24:02.619
pH is 6.8.

24:05.754 --> 24:08.210
We'll never get her back.
I'm calling it. Stop CPR.

24:11.051 --> 24:13.757
Put the husband in a quiet room.
I'll be right there.

24:19.771 --> 24:21.430
Good pickup.

24:22.149 --> 24:24.106
I would have missed
the diagnosis.

24:24.276 --> 24:26.370
A lot of good it did.

24:32.135 --> 24:36.596
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah. The boys bounce back quick.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.473
I think I might've tweaked it again.

24:38.643 --> 24:42.142
Want one of the doctors to take a look
at your back? Or your front?

24:42.314 --> 24:44.188
Is that Yetna?

24:44.358 --> 24:46.066
She's tossing her cookies.

24:46.235 --> 24:50.281
No cookies.
Chicken, potato and ice cream.

24:50.448 --> 24:53.118
- Dr. Carter, I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

24:53.285 --> 24:55.824
- Should we order an x-ray?
- No. It's just a spasm.

24:55.997 --> 24:59.082
Could be somatic dysfunction
at the myofascial junction.

24:59.251 --> 25:01.209
I studied alternative medicine
in Hong Kong.

25:01.378 --> 25:03.751
I could try a muscle-energy technique.

25:03.923 --> 25:06.497
I think you've done enough
for one day.

25:07.803 --> 25:10.009
- Help me mobilize the liver.
- Bovie and pickups.

25:10.180 --> 25:11.655
I want to get a good look at the IV seal.

25:11.742 --> 25:13.172
Peter! Where's Reece?

25:13.601 --> 25:15.725
- What?
- Reece isn't in the playroom.

25:15.896 --> 25:18.269
- You were picking him up at school.
- He wasn't there.

25:18.441 --> 25:20.268
- Free up the falciform.
- Where is he?

25:20.443 --> 25:22.401
- I thought you had him here.
- No.

25:22.571 --> 25:25.109
- Who let this guy in?
- Carla's mother pick him up?

25:25.282 --> 25:27.441
- No.
- Systolic's down to 60.

25:27.618 --> 25:30.536
Four-sucker bleed. Lap pads!
Let's pack off the liver.

25:30.705 --> 25:34.538
- Check- Her name is on a card at school.
- Okay. I'll try her.

25:34.710 --> 25:36.288
Good idea. You call Grandma...

25:36.463 --> 25:39.630
...and I'll roll this guy over
so we can all kiss his ass goodbye!

25:41.051 --> 25:42.925
Sign here.

25:43.721 --> 25:47.173
- Corday finally see him?
- No. I drank that Russian water.

25:47.350 --> 25:51.514
- Yetna's water?
- Yeah. I'm better now, no thanks to you.

25:51.689 --> 25:54.441
- Take this, you'll need it.
- You seen the girl in Exam 1?

25:54.609 --> 25:57.730
- She took off. She'll be back at 9.
- Why didn't anyone get me?

25:57.905 --> 26:00.776
- You were busy with the arrest.
- She has an ectopic.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.943
- You didn't tell me.
- Where's the chart?

26:03.119 --> 26:05.362
- It's here somewhere.
- Could you find it, please?

26:05.539 --> 26:09.833
Could you pull up "Razavi" on
the computer and print out a red sheet?

26:10.670 --> 26:13.340
Excuse me. We're here to see Dr. Carter.
She fainted.

26:13.506 --> 26:17.969
- I did not faint. I was dizzy.
- You'll need to see a triage nurse.

26:18.137 --> 26:20.095
- Is that you?
- Through those doors.

26:20.266 --> 26:23.386
We should go through those doors
and right back to the car.

26:23.561 --> 26:26.017
- Please. John Carter.
- Dr. Carter's very busy.

26:26.189 --> 26:27.220
John!

26:27.398 --> 26:30.104
If you wanna see a doctor,
you need to sign in at triage.

26:30.277 --> 26:32.436
- Gamma, what are you doing here?
- Ask him.

26:32.613 --> 26:35.105
- She fainted outside Marshall Field's.
- I did not.

26:35.283 --> 26:37.526
- Did you hit your head?
- No. I didn't faint.

26:37.703 --> 26:40.539
- This is your grandmother?
- Gamma, this is Susan Lewis.

26:40.706 --> 26:43.162
- Pleasure.
- I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

26:43.334 --> 26:46.206
Well, I guess you're only rude
to strangers.

26:46.880 --> 26:50.381
- John...
- Do you have any chest pains?

26:50.551 --> 26:55.463
Mrs. Wilson? Mrs. Wilson,
your surgery went very well.

26:55.641 --> 26:58.311
- You're finished?
- Yes. You're on your way to recovery.

26:58.478 --> 27:02.559
Good. I need your address.

27:02.733 --> 27:05.734
Gotta send you a thank-you note.

27:05.903 --> 27:08.573
- Dr. Corday? Dr. Corday?
- Yes.

27:08.740 --> 27:11.860
Carmen Torino from Infection Control.
Do you have a minute?

27:12.036 --> 27:15.240
- What do you need?
- To speak to you in private.

27:15.415 --> 27:21.086
Okay. Keep her fluids at 125 an hour.
Vitals Q 15, CBC in 30.

27:23.133 --> 27:26.253
You lost another patient today
from sepsis.

27:26.428 --> 27:28.836
Yes, but he was
debilitated before surgery.

27:29.014 --> 27:30.344
I understand.

27:30.517 --> 27:33.304
However, his death triggered
a formal investigation.

27:33.937 --> 27:36.061
- Excuse me?
- You need to be cultured.

27:36.231 --> 27:38.770
- Cultured?
- In case your body's carrying bacteria...

27:38.944 --> 27:43.108
...that's infecting your patients.
Can you stop by the clinic in an hour?

27:43.282 --> 27:46.069
That's impossible.
I have a patient waiting for me.

27:46.244 --> 27:49.031
Your surgical privileges
could be suspended.

27:49.206 --> 27:51.033
If you have concerns,
talk to my chairman.

27:51.208 --> 27:52.453
I already have.

27:52.626 --> 27:55.628
Drs. Romano and Anspaugh
have given us their full support.

27:57.132 --> 27:59.588
- She signed out AMA?
- No.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.880
- Call her back.
- She thinks she'll be deported.

28:03.055 --> 28:06.222
Tell her parents that she needs surgery
for an ovarian cyst.

28:06.393 --> 28:09.430
Falsify a consent form?
I'd rather keep them in the dark.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.978
She's pregnant.
They don't have to know.

28:12.150 --> 28:15.733
- You trust her to come back?
- I think so. I hope so.

28:15.904 --> 28:19.189
- Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday on two.
- Okay.

28:19.409 --> 28:21.200
- Home yet?
- Susan.

28:21.369 --> 28:26.448
Hi. I heard you lost one,
the INH overdose.

28:26.626 --> 28:28.998
- Yeah.
- Yeah, those can be tough.

28:29.170 --> 28:30.451
How long is it gonna take?

28:30.631 --> 28:33.835
I've been meaning to talk to you
about the nursing shortage.

28:34.009 --> 28:36.928
That blood alcohol came back
just over the limit.

28:37.096 --> 28:40.549
- The girl who hit her father, .092.
- Is he still in surgery?

28:40.726 --> 28:42.518
- Want me to tell the cop?
- I will.

28:42.686 --> 28:45.475
Anyway, if you could pitch in,
it'll make everyone happy.

28:45.648 --> 28:47.476
- The nurses are complaining?
- Yeah.

28:47.652 --> 28:50.023
I explained that you're used
to better staffing...

28:50.196 --> 28:53.151
...so they'll cut you some slack
until you're up to speed.

28:53.325 --> 28:55.781
Okay, okay. No problem.

28:55.953 --> 28:57.363
Can you cover my last hour?

28:57.538 --> 28:59.697
My first day back,
you're dumping on me?

28:59.875 --> 29:02.366
Elizabeth's stuck.
I have to get home to the baby.

29:02.544 --> 29:06.286
LP results are pending on Etzler.
And Nguyen's getting a V/Q.

29:06.465 --> 29:09.800
- Anything else?
- Yeah, pick me up some milk and Huggies.

29:11.763 --> 29:14.552
- BP's 120/80.
- Excellent. Take down the packing.

29:14.725 --> 29:16.848
Peter. Carla's mom's been home all day.

29:16.937 --> 29:17.968
Try Jackie.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.223
- I tried. I got Joanie.
- Did she pick him up?

29:20.399 --> 29:21.858
No.

29:22.026 --> 29:24.149
Retrohepatic caval injury. More suction.

29:24.237 --> 29:26.029
Call the police, now! I gotta go.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.161
Lost another 2 liters.

29:27.249 --> 29:29.525
Do a Pringle before the guy bleeds out.

29:29.702 --> 29:32.240
- Shirley, get Edson.
- Prep a number-eight atrial shunt.

29:32.413 --> 29:35.406
- I need to be relieved.
- Take your hands off his liver, he'll die.

29:38.921 --> 29:42.587
- Your EKG looks good.
- I told you, I'm fine.

29:42.759 --> 29:46.592
Alger means well, but sometimes
he's annoyingly condescending.

29:46.764 --> 29:48.223
You gave him a scare.

29:48.391 --> 29:51.061
I was a little woozy
getting out of the car.

29:51.228 --> 29:53.221
We call that near syncope.

29:53.397 --> 29:56.849
- I call it skipping lunch.
- Well, you need to eat.

29:57.318 --> 29:59.193
I'll do it.

30:00.489 --> 30:02.815
You been sleeping okay?

30:04.536 --> 30:07.205
Are you depressed?

30:07.372 --> 30:11.122
- I miss him, John.
- Me too.

30:12.211 --> 30:15.248
- Have you thought about therapy?
- I said, I miss him.

30:15.424 --> 30:19.719
- I'm not mentally unstable.
- Sometimes it's good to talk about it.

30:19.887 --> 30:24.217
What's to talk about? He's gone.
And I have things to do.

30:24.434 --> 30:26.925
If I leave now, I can still make
the donors' reception.

30:27.146 --> 30:29.684
We need to monitor
your heart overnight.

30:29.857 --> 30:31.767
In here? I don't think so.

30:31.944 --> 30:34.649
Let's just wait for your blood-test results
to come back.

30:34.821 --> 30:37.740
I've been waiting.
I've already missed two appointments.

30:37.909 --> 30:41.575
If everything checks out,
you'll be back on your feet tomorrow.

30:41.747 --> 30:45.792
There are no more tomorrows, John.
This is it.

30:45.961 --> 30:50.754
Your grandfather and I used to think
we had a lifetime of tomorrows.

30:53.845 --> 30:57.843
Hello, is Amal there?
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:58.809 --> 31:01.015
This is Susan, her friend from school.

31:01.187 --> 31:04.391
I just had a question
about our math homework.

31:04.566 --> 31:08.018
Oh, okay, great. Yeah, I'll call back
after dinner. Okay, thanks.

31:08.195 --> 31:11.482
- Dr. Lewis, Mr. Cardazco's still waiting.
- Who?

31:11.658 --> 31:15.787
- His wife died. The overdose.
- Oh, damn it! I completely forgot.

33:03.167 --> 33:06.833
Sorry. It has to be
a nasopharyngeal sample.

33:07.965 --> 33:11.215
Oh, sorry.
It felt more like a brain biopsy.

33:11.385 --> 33:14.802
The enterobacter from your patients
is a very resistant strain.

33:14.973 --> 33:16.800
I'm aware of that.

33:17.101 --> 33:18.845
You may be colonized.

33:19.020 --> 33:20.847
Open wide.

33:21.356 --> 33:23.764
Quick swab of the tonsils.

33:25.861 --> 33:27.605
God.

33:29.116 --> 33:32.615
- So are we finished?
- Just need to do a pelvic.

33:32.787 --> 33:34.198
You've gotta be kidding!

33:34.371 --> 33:38.205
A surgical tech in Ohio was passing
nocardia from her vaginal flora.

33:38.377 --> 33:40.603
Thank you for sharing that. I'm nursing.

33:40.696 --> 33:42.505
You want a sample of my milk as well?

33:42.673 --> 33:46.339
Absolutely.
Then a cath'd urine and a stool sample.

33:46.511 --> 33:49.928
If you can't go now, take it home
and bring it back in the morning.

33:54.020 --> 33:56.773
Inflate the balloon
and tie off the Rumel.

33:59.235 --> 34:01.311
- How is he?
- They're still working on him.

34:01.488 --> 34:03.196
Why are you leaving?
How much longer?

34:03.365 --> 34:05.903
I have another emergency.
Just wait in the room, okay?

34:06.076 --> 34:07.950
They want us to make out a report.

34:08.121 --> 34:11.284
This is Dr. Benton at County General.
Send a detective here.

34:11.458 --> 34:14.793
My son is missing! So do your job
and send someone down now!

34:14.962 --> 34:16.208
- ETA?
- Two minutes.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.623
- Flip you for the airway.
- He's already intubated.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.043
- What are we getting?
- Mercy's sending a GSW...

34:21.219 --> 34:23.427
- ... and we're out of beds.
- You coming?

34:23.598 --> 34:26.386
Move Trauma 1 to Exam 1.
Whose chart is this?

34:26.560 --> 34:27.804
Oh, that's mine.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.516
Code the charts at time of discharge
for Billing.

34:30.690 --> 34:33.893
- I'll do it right now.
- Yeah, and be sure the nurse's notes-

34:34.068 --> 34:36.393
- This patient left the hospital?
- Not sure.

34:36.571 --> 34:39.775
- You're not sure? She's an ectopic.
- It's under control.

34:39.951 --> 34:42.109
What do you mean? She's not here.

34:42.286 --> 34:44.114
I'm trying to protect her privacy.

34:44.206 --> 34:46.080
You should be protecting her life.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.121
- She'll be back in two hours.
- If she's still alive!

34:49.295 --> 34:50.755
Lost his pulse on the scene.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.583
I told her I wouldn't tell her parents.

34:52.675 --> 34:54.964
You're putting her life at risk
so she doesn't get into trouble.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.129
- Get 4 of O-neg.
- Trust me on this one.

34:57.305 --> 34:58.965
- Prep for a thoracotomy.
- Gown.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.763
Call your patient right now.
You're being completely irresponsible.

35:01.936 --> 35:05.382
- If she's sick, they can bring her in.
- Not if she's dead.

35:10.741 --> 35:13.741
- You got too many names on the list.
- Everyone helps out.

35:13.910 --> 35:15.736
The school can't keep track
of 10 people.

35:15.911 --> 35:17.737
Any stranger could say
he was his uncle.

35:17.912 --> 35:21.161
We've never had a problem before.
You sure you got there on time?

35:24.250 --> 35:26.538
What are you doing here?
Where were you?

35:26.710 --> 35:29.745
- What's going on?
- You picked him up from school?

35:29.920 --> 35:32.375
Yeah. He was acting out.
He bit a little girl.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.578
- You were in surgery. They called me.
- You had us worried.

35:35.756 --> 35:37.583
I left a message on your voice mail.

35:37.758 --> 35:40.592
It wasn't Peter's day to pick him up,
it was mine.

35:41.010 --> 35:44.010
- You're still picking him up?
- Every Tuesday and Thursday.

35:44.553 --> 35:48.764
He's had three fights
at recess this week.

35:48.931 --> 35:50.341
You fighting?

35:51.975 --> 35:54.726
Teacher wants to know
if there are any problems at home.

35:54.893 --> 35:57.763
She thinks he may need
a little more stability.

35:57.978 --> 36:00.433
What are you trying to say?

36:01.147 --> 36:03.637
- Just telling you what she said.
- He wasn't fighting...

36:03.815 --> 36:05.096
...when he lived with us.

36:05.275 --> 36:07.895
Maybe he needs to just live in one home
for a while, okay?

36:08.068 --> 36:10.605
Peter, he's my stepson.
We've got an agreement.

36:11.153 --> 36:15.149
Yeah? Well, we need to think
about what's best for Reece.

36:15.322 --> 36:17.480
He's acting out
because he lost his mother.

36:17.657 --> 36:22.897
Look, we'll talk about this later. I need
to call the police and get him home.

36:26.329 --> 36:29.697
Dr. Weaver, O.R. called. They don't
think Mr. Pomeroy's gonna make it.

36:29.873 --> 36:32.707
Okay, I'll go up.
Can you do the coroner's forms?

36:32.875 --> 36:35.281
Chuny, tell my grandmother
I'll be five more minutes.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.910
And see if Dr. Lewis called
that ectopic girl.

36:39.879 --> 36:41.337
Gamma.

36:41.922 --> 36:44.957
- What are you doing?
- It's late, John. I've been a good sport.

36:45.133 --> 36:48.795
You cannot leave. Fainting can be a
warning sign for heart attack, for stroke.

36:48.968 --> 36:50.296
I'll take my chances.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.675
You'll be signing out
against medical advice.

36:52.845 --> 36:57.007
- I've already done that.
- There's still more tests we need to do.

36:57.682 --> 37:00.634
I'll see you at home, John.

37:01.642 --> 37:05.852
Don't forget to turn out the porch light
when you come in.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.808
- Check on her in about an hour.
- Certainly.

37:08.980 --> 37:11.683
- Good night.
- I feel like a steak, Alger.

37:11.857 --> 37:14.181
- We'll stop at Morton's first.
- Yes, ma'am.

37:14.358 --> 37:19.102
Oh, dear, I'm very hungry.
Filet mignon, creamed spinach...

37:21.530 --> 37:24.944
- Sorry if I offended her.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

37:25.282 --> 37:27.357
She never takes me seriously.

37:27.533 --> 37:29.690
What do you expect?
She changed your diapers.

37:29.867 --> 37:31.113
That's true.

37:31.535 --> 37:34.286
Any focal neuro findings, EKG changes?

37:34.370 --> 37:36.576
No. I monitored her for three hours.

37:36.747 --> 37:39.118
Yeah, she should be okay.

37:39.415 --> 37:41.703
Weaver is looking for you.
Did you call your ectopic girl?

37:41.792 --> 37:43.202
I'm gonna give her till 9.

37:44.043 --> 37:47.042
- That's a bit of a risk.
- "Danger" is my middle name.

37:47.878 --> 37:50.369
Any other catastrophes?

37:50.714 --> 37:53.666
It's been like an acid flashback
without the good parts.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.295
What was I thinking
when I said I'd come back?

37:56.467 --> 37:57.878
You weren't.

37:58.052 --> 38:00.458
- But at least you're working with friends.
- Yes.

38:04.722 --> 38:07.509
Excuse me. Pickman's got a woman
in active labor.

38:07.682 --> 38:09.509
Showtime.

38:11.726 --> 38:13.718
Denise Frankel, full-term.
She's crowning.

38:13.894 --> 38:15.139
Showtime is right.

38:17.022 --> 38:20.187
- I need to push!
- Go ahead, push.

38:21.941 --> 38:23.767
Membrane's ruptured. Fluid's clear.

38:23.859 --> 38:25.548
- How many kids have you had?
- Two.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.482
Well, this one's coming fast.

38:29.404 --> 38:32.569
Take your foot off the pedal,
bed's rising.

38:32.739 --> 38:34.980
- I'm nowhere near it.
- Must be a short.

38:35.158 --> 38:37.150
- What's happening?
- Technical difficulty.

38:37.326 --> 38:40.943
Oh, man. When her water broke,
it must have flooded the switch.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.028
Late decel.
We have to get this baby out.

38:43.204 --> 38:45.576
- I can't deliver like this.
- Get Luka. He's tall.

38:45.748 --> 38:49.245
- Carter, take over.
- What-? Where are you going?

38:49.417 --> 38:51.242
What are you doing?

38:57.255 --> 39:00.456
Excuse me. Get down. Get down!

39:01.882 --> 39:03.080
Okay, just blow.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.582
Drop your arm over the side,
I need to start an IV.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.882
- Give me a hand.
- Oh, you're kidding me.

39:08.052 --> 39:10.423
- What are you doing?
- Setting up some equipment.

39:10.596 --> 39:13.596
- Fetal heart rate's 140.
- Don't drop my baby!

39:13.764 --> 39:16.255
Don't worry.
Dr. Carter used to be in the circus.

39:16.433 --> 39:18.259
As a clown, right?

39:18.559 --> 39:23.551
- Human cannonball, until I got fired.
- Okay, give a big push. Push!

39:24.646 --> 39:26.637
Push! Head's out. Relax.

39:26.814 --> 39:29.268
- That cord is tight around the neck.
- Reduce it?

39:29.440 --> 39:32.013
- I don't think so. How about a clamp?
- Toss it.

39:34.527 --> 39:35.855
Second clamp.

39:36.695 --> 39:38.105
Scissors.

39:43.116 --> 39:44.360
Is it a boy or a girl?

39:44.533 --> 39:46.655
One more push
and we're about to find out.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.911
It's a boy.

39:53.246 --> 39:55.535
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's beautiful.

39:55.707 --> 39:57.248
Can I see him?

39:57.416 --> 39:59.704
Yeah, as soon as we strap on
a parachute.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.784
Oh, yeah.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.952
"Hi, Mom. "

40:09.340 --> 40:14.629
- I killed him! Oh, my God, I killed him.
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

40:15.468 --> 40:17.756
I need to see him. I need to see him.

40:17.928 --> 40:21.841
Miss Pomeroy? We have to leave now.
I'm required to place you under arrest.

40:22.014 --> 40:24.634
- It was an accident! He was my father!
- Calm down!

40:24.807 --> 40:28.017
- You have the right to remain silent-
- Is this really necessary?

40:28.143 --> 40:30.715
- We only had a couple glasses of wine!
- Let her say bye.

40:30.895 --> 40:34.593
- Where is he? Where did you put him?
- Let her say goodbye.

40:34.772 --> 40:36.479
This way.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.318
God, I'm sorry.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.481
I'm sorry.

40:55.118 --> 40:57.987
- I got Ella's diaper culture.
- You didn't need to do that.

40:58.161 --> 41:01.494
- Hey, not with the food.
- I triple-bagged them.

41:01.705 --> 41:03.993
- Did I hear a phone ring?
- No.

41:04.164 --> 41:05.955
- She still hasn't called?
- Not yet.

41:06.124 --> 41:08.744
- The party was over at 8.
- I know.

41:08.917 --> 41:11.242
- So call her.
- I don't have her phone number.

41:11.419 --> 41:13.660
- Look it up.
- I didn't get Claire's last name.

41:13.837 --> 41:16.162
Mark, you need to know these things.

41:16.339 --> 41:19.043
I talked to the parents,
I thought everything was okay.

41:19.216 --> 41:23.081
- We don't even know where she is.
- I told you about the party.

41:23.677 --> 41:25.964
- You know what time it is?
- It's only 10: 15.

41:26.136 --> 41:28.175
You were supposed to call
two hours ago.

41:28.347 --> 41:30.422
- I'm sorry.
- How'd you get home?

41:30.598 --> 41:34.297
- Andrew.
- I think I'll check on the little one.

41:35.767 --> 41:39.301
All they had were hot dogs and burgers,
so some of us went to eat.

41:39.394 --> 41:41.351
- Some of us, or you and Andrew?
- Dad!

41:41.520 --> 41:45.564
- I need to know these things.
- Sounds like something Mom would say.

41:47.816 --> 41:51.647
I wasn't drinking. I'm not doing drugs.
I'm just making some new friends.

41:51.819 --> 41:54.356
- All you had to do was call.
- I tried.

41:54.529 --> 41:56.686
The pay phone was broken.

41:57.447 --> 42:00.612
If you don't believe me,
call the restaurant.

42:01.742 --> 42:03.864
Don't ever let this happen again.

42:05.493 --> 42:07.451
Okay?

42:07.954 --> 42:09.862
Okay.

42:13.123 --> 42:15.696
If I had a cell phone,
we could keep in touch.

42:15.875 --> 42:19.954
- Yeah, right.
- Seriously, just for emergencies.

42:21.628 --> 42:23.537
We'll see.

42:23.713 --> 42:25.705
Thanks.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.418
- You guys do good work.
- So do you.

42:37.597 --> 42:40.596
I'll call you when it's time
to build his tree house.

42:44.142 --> 42:46.051
- Amal.
- Dr. Lewis.

42:46.227 --> 42:48.599
I'm so sorry I'm late.
It was hard to sneak out.

42:48.770 --> 42:52.303
- I am so glad you came back.
- I told the nurse I'd be here at 9.

42:52.481 --> 42:55.730
- Well, people say a lot of things.
- You said it was important.

42:55.899 --> 43:00.311
- Abby, can you find us a room?
- Yeah. Good to see you.

43:01.569 --> 43:04.273
- Where's her chart?
- Weaver's got it.

43:04.446 --> 43:06.403
- Amal's chart? Why?
- I don't know.

43:06.572 --> 43:08.066
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.987
- She's on a call in the lounge.
- Oh, damn it!

43:15.119 --> 43:17.692
- Kerry, get off the phone.
- I work at the ER-

43:17.871 --> 43:20.326
- She's here. You don't have to call.
- Susan-

43:20.498 --> 43:22.573
I told you she'd be back.

43:22.749 --> 43:24.705
- Who?
- Amal, the ectopic.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.247
I didn't call her.

43:39.510 --> 43:43.126
Hello. Hi.
I'm sorry we got disconnected.

43:43.387 --> 43:46.836
No, actually, I got your number
from an investigator...

43:47.014 --> 43:50.677
...who specializes
in finding birth parents.

43:51.892 --> 43:55.259
Did you give up
a daughter for adoption?

43:57.604 --> 43:59.643
I understand.

43:59.813 --> 44:01.722
No. I-

44:01.898 --> 44:06.605
I am sorry. I thought
this was from a reliable source.

44:06.776 --> 44:10.606
I will not bother you again.

44:11.362 --> 44:13.151
Good night.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.554
