If your toddler doesn't sleep
and cries all night,

01:34.699 --> 01:36.532
it might very well be gas

01:36.534 --> 01:38.067
that has you on the verge

01:38.069 --> 01:39.168
of a nervous breakdown.

01:39.170 --> 01:41.737
First, pick him or her up,

01:41.739 --> 01:45.507
stomach down, gently patting...

01:45.509 --> 01:48.144
Kind of like a football, right?

01:48.146 --> 01:50.146
And you pat him gently.

01:50.148 --> 01:52.113
You can even rock him

01:52.115 --> 01:54.316
going round and round
in circles,

01:54.318 --> 01:58.219
like stirring a big pot of soup.

01:58.221 --> 02:01.056
Bob, bob, bob, bob.

02:01.058 --> 02:03.724
Aw, what's he gonna be
when he grows up?

02:03.726 --> 02:04.993
A basketball?

02:04.995 --> 02:06.361
If all this doesn't help...

02:09.365 --> 02:11.365
Face. Hair. Football.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.068
Take it family life's
just peachy.

02:14.070 --> 02:15.635
(blows through lips)

02:15.637 --> 02:18.805
(laughing): A week ago,
it was just me at the house.

02:18.807 --> 02:22.042
Now I got a crying toddler
keeping me up at night

02:22.044 --> 02:24.111
and a mama I barely know.

02:24.113 --> 02:26.045
You knew her well enough
to make the toddler.

02:26.047 --> 02:29.148
(scoffs) Plus, she keeps
texting me every minute.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.650
"Pick up sippy cups,
pick up diapers.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.785
Pick up this, pick up that."

02:32.787 --> 02:35.821
I don't even know
what a sippy cup is.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.823
Is this you asking
me for advice?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.225
Because, normally,

02:39.227 --> 02:41.194
I'd love to help,
Lasalle, I really would,

02:41.196 --> 02:43.695
but I'm back home in DC in about
a minute and a half.

02:43.697 --> 02:47.532
Except the problem is,
you're the only one that knows.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.401
Right.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.769
That is the problem.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.238
It's a little awkward,
don't you think?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.606
I mean, I thought you would
have told Country Mouse

02:54.608 --> 02:55.807
about it by now.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.842
(laughing)
I'm Country Mouse, all right?

02:57.844 --> 03:00.644
Percy, she's City Mouse.
You know what?

03:00.646 --> 03:02.413
You ought to talk to Pride
about this.

03:02.415 --> 03:05.883
That man's got more homespun
advice than Dr. Phil.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.168
I heard he's got a daughter;
she turned out all right.

03:07.192 --> 03:08.186
(groans)

03:08.187 --> 03:09.820
Yo, yo, yo, what's up?

03:10.789 --> 03:12.956
Percy, hey.
What's up?

03:12.958 --> 03:15.092
What's up?

03:16.062 --> 03:17.227
What's going on?

03:17.229 --> 03:18.389
LASALLE AND GREGORIO:
Nothing.

03:43.954 --> 03:46.021
Morning, Sonja.
- Hey.

03:46.023 --> 03:48.357
You making enough for two?
Sure.

03:51.594 --> 03:52.660
I got it.

03:52.662 --> 03:54.062
Oh, great.

03:59.235 --> 04:00.935
Something on your mind?

04:00.937 --> 04:02.870
(scoffs)
No, I'm good.

04:05.175 --> 04:07.542
Okay, can you tell me
what's wrong with Lasalle?

04:07.544 --> 04:09.876
He's jumpy, he's
getting these texts.

04:09.878 --> 04:11.978
He looks like a zombie,
but he won't tell me about it.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.880
Does seem a little bit
distracted lately.

04:13.882 --> 04:15.949
Right. So.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.351
When's the "Pride talking to"
scheduled?

04:18.353 --> 04:19.851
Doesn't work like that.

04:19.853 --> 04:21.154
He'll come around

04:21.156 --> 04:22.755
when he's ready.
Ready, ready, right.

04:22.757 --> 04:24.857
See, the thing is,
he already told FBI.

04:24.859 --> 04:27.326
She's obviously
hip to it, so...

04:27.328 --> 04:28.994
I think he's ready.

04:28.996 --> 04:31.197
(phone rings)

04:33.234 --> 04:34.900
Pride.

04:36.737 --> 04:40.506
Okay... Okay.

04:40.508 --> 04:41.940
Got to get the coffee to go.

04:41.942 --> 04:43.708
We got a dead sailor
by St. Mary's Park.

04:48.248 --> 04:50.415
(siren wailing)

04:52.119 --> 04:53.551
There's Loretta.

04:54.387 --> 04:56.121
Fresh chicory...

04:56.123 --> 04:58.623
in hopes that you will
tell me all you know.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.224
(chuckles)
Bribery's not needed, Dwayne.

05:00.226 --> 05:02.993
But it's always happily
encouraged.

05:02.995 --> 05:06.763
So, across the street
a rowdy motorcycle rally,

05:06.765 --> 05:10.267
thousands of "American outlaws"
in town.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.068
Can't say I didn't
expect a casualty,

05:12.070 --> 05:13.937
just didn't expect it
to be yours.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.805
Well, the Vic
is Lloyd Fillibert.

05:15.807 --> 05:18.574
BU1 stationed
in Gulfport, Mississippi.

05:18.576 --> 05:21.344
There's paperwork
from the Oasis Motel.

05:21.346 --> 05:24.180
Feet away from Bike Week's
festival grounds.

05:24.182 --> 05:27.216
Seabee was visiting
for the biggest

05:27.218 --> 05:29.118
motorcycle rally
in the South.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.320
Question is...

05:31.322 --> 05:33.122
how'd the ride turn deadly?

05:33.124 --> 05:34.589
Well, here's the basics.

05:36.393 --> 05:37.792
It's a small caliber round.

05:37.794 --> 05:40.061
It entered through
the rear of the rib cage,

05:40.063 --> 05:41.963
perforated the
poor soul's heart.

05:41.965 --> 05:43.165
It was a clean shot.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.299
Was dead in seconds.

05:44.301 --> 05:45.767
That kind of an eye for detail,

05:45.769 --> 05:47.269
we're not looking at
an accidental shooting.

05:47.271 --> 05:49.437
Try road rage.

05:49.439 --> 05:51.572
NOPD tells us your Vic
was lined up for a street race.

05:51.574 --> 05:53.440
Well, that would explain
the burnt rubber.

05:53.442 --> 05:56.310
I'm guessing maybe... 20 bikers?

05:56.312 --> 05:58.579
And if Fillibert was shot
at close range...

05:58.581 --> 06:00.914
The killer was one of them.

06:00.916 --> 06:03.417
Motorcycle race goes down
in New Orleans,

06:03.419 --> 06:04.985
there's gonna be onlookers,
Chris.

06:04.987 --> 06:06.253
Well, I already checked.

06:06.255 --> 06:08.354
Either the witnesses
fled from the scene

06:08.356 --> 06:10.223
or they have a case
of selective memory.

06:10.225 --> 06:12.425
May have been afraid to rat
on the wrong club.

06:12.427 --> 06:14.060
MCs can go anywhere

06:14.062 --> 06:15.161
from harmless weekend warriors

06:15.163 --> 06:16.929
to elaborate crime syndicates.

06:16.931 --> 06:18.764
Seen my share at ATF to know.

06:18.766 --> 06:21.501
It's smart to keep quiet.

06:22.737 --> 06:26.438
Victim was a member
of the Brothers at Arms.

06:28.141 --> 06:30.809
Club's got a long-standing
history in New Orleans.

06:30.811 --> 06:33.245
Started as an honorable idea.

06:33.247 --> 06:35.847
Disenfranchised vets
without home or purpose

06:35.849 --> 06:38.250
banded together
to give them both.

06:38.252 --> 06:39.851
Supposed to do good
after Katrina.

06:39.853 --> 06:41.219
But...

06:41.221 --> 06:42.687
Others didn't want
them on their turf.

06:42.689 --> 06:44.555
Yeah, 'cause the turf
belonged to the Niners.

06:44.557 --> 06:46.624
Bad motorcycle gang.

06:46.626 --> 06:48.659
Drug dealing,
trafficking weapons...

06:48.661 --> 06:51.128
I used to go after them
when I was with ATF.

06:51.130 --> 06:52.597
Tried to root them out,
but turned out

06:52.599 --> 06:53.664
they were too well entrenched.

06:53.666 --> 06:55.266
Yeah, smart, too.

06:55.268 --> 06:57.735
Somehow made the vets look
like they were the bad guys.

06:57.737 --> 06:59.603
Didn't help back then
that some folks thought

06:59.605 --> 07:01.904
all vets were damaged
goods and violent.

07:01.906 --> 07:04.274
Even though they were
really here to help rebuild?

07:04.276 --> 07:07.377
Niners viewed them as a threat,
just wanted them gone.

07:07.379 --> 07:09.346
Sucked them into a fight,
innocent people got hurt,

07:09.348 --> 07:11.881
and the vets
took the blame

07:11.883 --> 07:13.049
for all the unrest.

07:13.051 --> 07:14.684
The city...
quick to judge,

07:14.686 --> 07:16.518
so they left.
- And now this

07:16.520 --> 07:18.820
for a warm welcome.
Speak of the devil. (engines revving)

07:20.124 --> 07:21.557
There's the Niners
right there.

07:24.228 --> 07:26.328
Oh.

07:31.769 --> 07:33.468
He didn't spot me, did he?

07:33.470 --> 07:34.602
Who?

07:34.604 --> 07:36.170
I think she's talking
about the cute guy,

07:36.172 --> 07:39.707
tribals on a tank,
Johnny Depp circa 1990.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.342
Know him I take it?

07:41.344 --> 07:42.410
Yeah, sort of.

07:42.412 --> 07:44.011
He was an ATF informant.

07:44.013 --> 07:45.045
Ramon.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.581
Ramon?

07:47.417 --> 07:48.683
Is he a Niner?

07:48.685 --> 07:50.950
No, he used to build

07:50.952 --> 07:52.852
custom bikes... or
at least he used to.

07:52.854 --> 07:54.621
He's probably here
for the rally.

07:54.623 --> 07:55.989
PRIDE: Okay.

07:55.991 --> 07:59.293
Percy, Gregorio,
deep-dive both clubs,

07:59.295 --> 08:00.694
get us caught up
on everybody involved.

08:00.696 --> 08:01.895
Chris and I
are gonna go figure out

08:01.897 --> 08:03.029
what happened to the victim.

08:03.031 --> 08:04.063
See who'd want

08:04.065 --> 08:05.399
him dead and why.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.599
Don't scratch it, Yankee.

08:08.736 --> 08:10.202
What?

08:10.204 --> 08:12.405
Overly casual response,

08:12.407 --> 08:13.839
one-sided shoulder shrug,

08:13.841 --> 08:15.040
lowered voice.

08:15.042 --> 08:16.642
I know a good cover
when I see it.

08:16.644 --> 08:18.010
I'm sorry?

08:18.012 --> 08:20.446
Oh, please, hot informant,
Ramon?

08:20.448 --> 08:21.681
I'm a profiler,

08:21.683 --> 08:22.715
remember?

08:22.717 --> 08:24.316
Yeah, obviously not a good one.

08:24.318 --> 08:26.318
I'm driving.

08:30.724 --> 08:32.890
(phone rings)

08:37.163 --> 08:38.462
I'm not one to pry,

08:38.465 --> 08:40.298
Christopher.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.232
It's none of
my business...

08:42.234 --> 08:43.667
unless it's something
that affects work,

08:43.669 --> 08:45.035
but you got something going on
and you need

08:45.037 --> 08:47.771
to talk...

08:47.773 --> 08:49.340
I can handle it, King.

08:49.342 --> 08:50.341
Don't worry.

08:50.343 --> 08:52.343
I'm not worrying.

08:52.345 --> 08:55.245
Just... here if
you need me.

08:55.247 --> 08:59.615
Well... just might be a...
bigger conversation is all.

08:59.617 --> 09:01.150
I'm still...

09:01.152 --> 09:02.985
trying to sort it
all out and...

09:02.987 --> 09:04.053
I want to do this

09:04.055 --> 09:06.456
the right way.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.290
Keep an open mind, but...

09:08.292 --> 09:10.827
Specifics would be helpful.

09:12.664 --> 09:14.363
I think I might be a dad, King.

09:14.365 --> 09:16.598
Or I mean...

09:16.600 --> 09:19.167
I am a dad.

09:19.169 --> 09:21.603
I had no idea until this...

09:21.605 --> 09:24.606
woman shows up with a baby boy.

09:24.608 --> 09:26.241
Oh.

09:26.243 --> 09:29.177
Yeah, exactly.

09:29.179 --> 09:31.645
Like I said,
a bigger conversation.

09:32.815 --> 09:33.881
PRIDE:
Well, we're here.

09:33.883 --> 09:35.383
Hold that thought.

09:40.089 --> 09:42.256
Vets look like they're
going somewhere.

09:42.258 --> 09:44.625
Not yet they're not.

09:45.561 --> 09:47.428
Now, easy, Chris.
You come up on the vets

09:47.430 --> 09:49.195
barrel first,

09:49.197 --> 09:50.497
lose any chance
of cooperation.

09:50.499 --> 09:52.164
Trust me.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.477
Oh, you badging us now?

10:05.479 --> 10:06.545
Captain Hogan.

10:06.547 --> 10:07.679
My partner,

10:07.681 --> 10:08.881
Christopher Lasalle.

10:11.919 --> 10:13.251
Not here

10:13.253 --> 10:15.353
to arrest anyone, just...

10:15.355 --> 10:17.355
just want to talk.

10:17.357 --> 10:18.990
(sighs)

10:18.992 --> 10:20.426
How you been? A long time.

10:20.428 --> 10:22.560
Well, not long enough
to forget how cops

10:22.562 --> 10:24.061
come investigating us

10:24.063 --> 10:26.831
when it's one of our
own getting killed.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.166
City sent you to make
us leave, Pride?

10:29.168 --> 10:31.936
A lot of things went wrong,
I admit.

10:31.938 --> 10:34.204
Yeah, it did. We got chased
out of town like a bunch

10:34.206 --> 10:35.673
of criminals all because

10:35.675 --> 10:39.043
NOPD was too afraid
to take on the real outlaws.

10:39.045 --> 10:40.209
We're not NOPD.

10:41.079 --> 10:42.712
Here for information,

10:42.714 --> 10:43.747
not accusations.

10:43.749 --> 10:45.715
Need to know why you came back.

10:45.717 --> 10:49.719
Okay? It might help us find out
who killed your man.

10:49.721 --> 10:52.121
Save the tax dollars, Sheriff.

10:52.123 --> 10:54.591
Niners killed Fillibert.
Easy as that.

10:54.593 --> 10:56.459
And how are you so sure?

10:58.295 --> 11:00.963
My club came back for the rally.

11:00.965 --> 11:03.098
Thought after ten years,
maybe we'd start over,

11:03.100 --> 11:05.167
places still need
rebuilding.

11:05.169 --> 11:07.202
Barely crossed state line
'fore we hear

11:07.204 --> 11:09.204
that the Niners
are planning something.

11:09.206 --> 11:10.539
Now, one of
'em must've

11:10.541 --> 11:12.374
convinced him to run
in their race

11:12.376 --> 11:14.776
as a-a peace offering.

11:14.778 --> 11:17.545
Got Fillibert shot instead.

11:17.547 --> 11:19.180
He was racing the Niners?

11:19.182 --> 11:22.416
Surrounded him, ten to one.
Then one of them killed him.

11:25.088 --> 11:27.555
I'm not waiting on the law
to do the right thing

11:27.557 --> 11:29.056
this time.
- Okay,

11:29.058 --> 11:30.924
you want to make a fresh start?

11:30.926 --> 11:33.594
You don't want
to be called criminals?

11:33.596 --> 11:36.296
You go out there, retaliate,

11:36.298 --> 11:37.831
that's all you're gonna be.

11:39.535 --> 11:41.468
Know you've been mistreated
in the past.

11:41.470 --> 11:43.604
That doesn't make this right.

11:43.606 --> 11:46.439
Got to give me
a chance here, Hogan.

11:46.441 --> 11:48.941
Let us find out
who killed your man.

11:48.943 --> 11:51.410
We'll bring him to justice.

11:53.615 --> 11:55.815
You better.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.155
(engines starting)

12:12.365 --> 12:14.499
(music playing faintly)

12:14.501 --> 12:16.902
(engines rumbling)

12:16.904 --> 12:19.571
PRIDE:
Still, you should probably

12:19.573 --> 12:21.805
tell Percy what's going
on at some point.

12:21.807 --> 12:24.408
She's concerned,
hopes you're okay.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.510
Hey, I know I should.
(chuckles)

12:26.512 --> 12:29.112
But I'm scared Percy's gonna
whup my butt for being stupid.

12:29.114 --> 12:30.714
(laughing):
Well, she might.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.517
Listen, this is a tough one.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.786
You'll figure it out.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.454
All right. About the Niners.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.055
Yeah.
- I know they got

12:39.057 --> 12:41.090
a rap sheet
and there's a lot of bad blood

12:41.092 --> 12:42.692
between them and the vets,

12:42.694 --> 12:44.761
but do you really think
Fillibert's the casualty

12:44.763 --> 12:46.596
of a ten-year-old grudge?
It's hard

12:46.598 --> 12:48.965
not to consider it, based on how
and where he was killed.

12:48.967 --> 12:51.701
Still, why do you think
the Niners are gonna talk to us?

12:51.703 --> 12:53.803
'Cause they don't want the law
up and in their business

12:53.805 --> 12:55.171
any more
than they do the vets.

12:55.173 --> 12:56.572
All I know is we
got to figure out

12:56.574 --> 12:57.539
what's going on

12:57.541 --> 12:59.575
before things escalate.

13:05.649 --> 13:08.650
♪ ♪

13:27.597 --> 13:30.932
Thanks, Chief. Appreciate it.

13:31.389 --> 13:33.655
Marshal's ruling out

13:33.657 --> 13:35.957
any accidental explosion.

13:35.959 --> 13:39.126
Sebastian's almost done inside,
thinks he might have something.

13:39.128 --> 13:41.396
How many casualties?
Five, two critical.

13:41.398 --> 13:42.142
All Niners?

13:42.166 --> 13:44.464
Yeah, apparently they were
holding a meeting inside.

13:45.235 --> 13:46.377
Which means
whoever did this...

13:46.401 --> 13:47.936
Knew they'd be here.

13:47.937 --> 13:51.304
I know you don't want to hear
it, King, but maybe the vets...

13:51.306 --> 13:53.807
Could've taken justice in
their own hands. I know.

13:53.809 --> 13:55.409
Doesn't make sense, though.

13:55.411 --> 13:57.177
If Hogan had
already planned this,

13:57.179 --> 14:00.180
why send us over here
so we could see it all?

14:00.182 --> 14:02.549
MAN:
Hey! You!

14:02.551 --> 14:04.551
What are you gonna do
about this, huh?

14:04.553 --> 14:05.472
You gonna arrest
these bastards or not?

14:05.496 --> 14:06.354
Morrow.

14:06.355 --> 14:08.855
You know him?
Leader of the Niners.

14:08.857 --> 14:10.757
You need to calm
down, take it easy.

14:10.759 --> 14:12.725
I figured it'd be you
working on this case.

14:12.727 --> 14:16.061
Just like ten years ago, huh?
Both know damn well who did it.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.531
We're not jumping to conclusions,
just like we're not jumping to conclusions

14:18.533 --> 14:19.980
about who shot one
of their men either.

14:20.004 --> 14:21.702
You protecting them?

14:21.703 --> 14:23.468
Is that what this is?
Just because they're vets?

14:23.470 --> 14:25.003
- This has nothing to do with them being...
- Hey!

14:25.005 --> 14:26.838
Hey, hey.
We got it under control.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.273
All right?

14:28.275 --> 14:29.875
So, why don't you just back off?

14:31.545 --> 14:35.280
(indistinct police transmission)

14:35.282 --> 14:36.948
(siren wailing in distance)

14:36.950 --> 14:39.384
He ought to be more grateful.
He's lucky to be alive.

14:39.386 --> 14:41.552
What'd you find, Sebastian?

14:41.554 --> 14:43.421
Uh, mostly shrapnel.

14:43.423 --> 14:45.155
Looks like it came
from some kind of detonator.

14:45.157 --> 14:46.757
I'm thinking
improvised explosives device.

14:46.759 --> 14:48.225
IED.

14:48.227 --> 14:49.693
Anything on the explosives?

14:49.695 --> 14:51.495
Yeah. Matter of fact,
got to finally use

14:51.497 --> 14:54.131
my laser-induced
breakdown spectroscope again.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.833
It identifies
explosives on site.

14:55.835 --> 14:58.367
Also fulfills my lifelong dream
of wielding a laser gun.

14:58.369 --> 15:00.537
What exactly did it identify?
Well,

15:00.539 --> 15:03.506
given the nitroglycerin base,
sorbents, and stabilizers,

15:03.508 --> 15:05.274
it looks
like old-school dynamite.

15:05.276 --> 15:08.277
Used mostly (phone ringing)
just for demolition these days.

15:08.279 --> 15:10.279
Demolished it is.

15:10.281 --> 15:11.815
Tell me things.

15:11.817 --> 15:13.215
GREGORIO: Well,
there's good news and bad news.

15:13.217 --> 15:14.783
Gonna spare you the choice.

15:14.785 --> 15:17.586
ATF still classifies the Niners
as a motorcycle gang.

15:17.588 --> 15:20.522
Two of 'em are up
on murder charges as we speak.

15:20.524 --> 15:22.658
FBI also shows several
attempted sting ops

15:22.660 --> 15:24.059
on racketeering charges,

15:24.061 --> 15:25.327
though nothing's stuck so far.

15:25.329 --> 15:26.962
Anything on the vets?

15:26.964 --> 15:28.964
That's the good news.
Other than a few bar fights,

15:28.966 --> 15:30.499
they check out clean.

15:30.501 --> 15:32.266
Yeah, in fact, city hall shows

15:32.268 --> 15:35.035
Fillibert pulled up a permit
six months ago.

15:35.037 --> 15:36.904
Apparently the vets were
planning to help build

15:36.906 --> 15:39.039
affordable housing
in Broadmoor.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.240
Broadmoor's where they tried

15:40.242 --> 15:42.176
to build ten years ago.
Yeah.

15:42.178 --> 15:44.011
Right after that jerk
stole the Katrina funds.

15:44.013 --> 15:45.212
McKinley.

15:45.214 --> 15:47.414
How do you know about McKinley?

15:47.416 --> 15:48.815
Long story.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.316
Any chance

15:50.318 --> 15:52.352
Fillibert's permit
gave the vets access

15:52.354 --> 15:54.387
to demolition explosives?

15:54.389 --> 15:55.455
Looking into it.

15:58.126 --> 16:02.696
Here. Shows the order
of a pickup last week. Why?

16:02.698 --> 16:04.664
That what blew up
the Niners' shop?

16:04.666 --> 16:08.300
You thinking the vets
retaliated for Fillibert?

16:08.302 --> 16:09.802
Every sign's pointing
in that direction.

16:09.804 --> 16:13.506
It just...
doesn't make sense though.

16:13.508 --> 16:16.375
See where Loretta's at
on Fillibert's autopsy.

16:16.377 --> 16:18.176
Maybe we can match bullet
to gun.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.245
Chris'll go to the hospital,
find out what the vics know.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.314
Coming back to the squad room?
No.

16:22.316 --> 16:25.383
Pay another visit to the vets.
This time with a warrant.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.785
We need to hustle here.
Bring in Fillibert's killer

16:27.787 --> 16:30.588
and the bomber before things
get out of control.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.189
Thanks.

16:34.193 --> 16:37.161
(ship horn blowing)

16:41.800 --> 16:43.901
Hey! What are you doing here?

16:46.204 --> 16:50.206
You are supposed to be
arresting Fillibert's killer!

16:50.208 --> 16:52.576
I'm still investigating that.

16:52.578 --> 16:57.379
Also investigating who blew up
the Niners' bike shop.

16:57.381 --> 16:58.748
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.983
Well, I hope
that's true.

17:00.985 --> 17:03.385
'Cause a lot of people
got hurt.

17:03.387 --> 17:06.320
All I know so far
is that, uh,

17:06.323 --> 17:09.759
demolition explosives
were used over there.

17:09.761 --> 17:12.161
Oh, jumping to
conclusions again, huh?

17:12.163 --> 17:14.228
Par the course
for you people.

17:14.230 --> 17:15.797
Just gathering evidence.

17:15.799 --> 17:17.632
But I got to tell you,

17:17.634 --> 17:19.800
if you or your boys
didn't do it,

17:19.803 --> 17:22.971
somebody's working awful hard
to make it look like you did.

17:22.973 --> 17:27.208
Maybe, uh, history
repeating itself again?

17:27.210 --> 17:30.445
Maybe. Only way to prove
you didn't retaliate, though,

17:30.447 --> 17:34.915
is to make sure that
the explosives don't match.

17:34.917 --> 17:38.485
Evidence. That'll
square you away.

17:39.354 --> 17:42.990
You got a warrant?

17:45.595 --> 17:48.461
Do I need one?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.934
(sighs)

17:57.238 --> 17:59.238
There you go.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.374
I brought one
just in case.

18:02.376 --> 18:04.510
Just so we're clear.

18:06.146 --> 18:08.614
If this comes back a match,

18:08.616 --> 18:12.818
next time I'll come back
with arrest warrants.

18:20.327 --> 18:21.559
(siren wails in distance)

18:21.561 --> 18:23.260
GREGORIO:
<i>Just saying,</i>

18:23.262 --> 18:25.496
you know I know.
I know you know what?

18:25.498 --> 18:27.397
That there's more
to this Ramon thing

18:27.399 --> 18:28.899
than you're letting on to,
and the more you pretend

18:28.901 --> 18:30.070
there's not, the more
I know there is.

18:30.071 --> 18:32.570
Girl,
you need to get a life.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.739
Sorry, my life's back in DC.

18:34.741 --> 18:36.774
This is all I got.
- Look.

18:36.776 --> 18:40.309
I worked a case with ATF,
an arms pipeline,

18:40.311 --> 18:42.411
uh, run by another
motorcycle gang.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.980
Ramon built them some bikes,

18:43.982 --> 18:45.882
and I used him to get in,
that's it.

18:45.884 --> 18:47.283
You screwed him.
What?

18:47.285 --> 18:49.418
You gonna say you didn't?
(laughs)

18:49.420 --> 18:50.987
Okay.

18:50.989 --> 18:53.589
Well, first do you want
to tell me how you knew

18:53.591 --> 18:55.991
about McKinley stealing
those Katrina funds?

18:55.993 --> 18:58.193
Uh-huh.

18:58.195 --> 19:00.996
Yeah. Looks like I'm not
the only one with secrets.

19:00.998 --> 19:02.497
Work. Shall we?

19:03.467 --> 19:05.367
The bullet was a .22 caliber,

19:05.369 --> 19:08.037
but more interesting
is a piece of fiber

19:08.039 --> 19:11.674
I found inside the bullet wound.

19:11.676 --> 19:13.274
(beeps)

19:13.276 --> 19:16.410
So, not from what Fillibert
was wearing, I take it?

19:16.412 --> 19:17.912
No, and it had trace amounts

19:17.914 --> 19:19.814
of gunshot residue on it,
which means...

19:19.816 --> 19:21.949
It came from the discharge.
Shooter's clothing?

19:21.951 --> 19:22.984
That's the theory.
- Yeah.

19:22.986 --> 19:24.351
Killer rolls up to Fillibert,

19:24.353 --> 19:25.820
gun concealed under his jacket,

19:25.822 --> 19:27.655
pulls the trigger...
Shoots through it,

19:27.657 --> 19:28.856
delivering us the breadcrumb.

19:28.858 --> 19:29.956
And...

19:29.958 --> 19:30.991
Hmm?

19:30.993 --> 19:32.392
The most important thing, dear.

19:32.394 --> 19:34.061
Yes. Uh, I might be able
to recover

19:34.063 --> 19:37.497
touch DNA and ID your killer.
I just need a little time.

19:37.499 --> 19:40.067
Something we don't have much of.
Is there anything

19:40.069 --> 19:42.302
you can tell us now, help us
narrow down the suspect pool?

19:42.304 --> 19:44.705
Well, the questionable
fashion choice might help.

19:44.707 --> 19:46.506
The fiber came from
a gold metallic thread,

19:46.508 --> 19:47.773
which means either it was

19:47.775 --> 19:50.375
Liberace, or...
The one motorcycle gang

19:50.377 --> 19:51.877
flying gold patches.

19:51.879 --> 19:53.112
The Niners.

19:53.114 --> 19:55.380
LASALLE:
<i>All I heard</i>

19:55.382 --> 19:58.483
from the hospital was how bad
the Niners want payback.

19:58.485 --> 20:00.920
Well, vets do, too,
from everything I can gather.

20:00.922 --> 20:02.788
But if they're the ones that
blew up the Niners' shop,

20:02.790 --> 20:04.255
then they already
got their payback.

20:04.257 --> 20:06.157
Unless they're not the ones
that blew it up.

20:06.159 --> 20:07.325
Well, I don't know
who else could've.

20:07.327 --> 20:08.893
The vets are loaded for bear.

20:08.895 --> 20:10.895
Do we have
an explosives match yet?

20:10.897 --> 20:14.032
Sebastian's still analyzing.
It's hard to think

20:14.034 --> 20:15.967
it's not just an eye for an eye.
Yeah,

20:15.969 --> 20:18.002
and it's only
gonna get worse, too.

20:18.004 --> 20:21.105
We can't stand by and let
two motorcycle clubs

20:21.107 --> 20:23.406
take justice
into their own hands.

20:23.408 --> 20:25.976
You mean <i>continue</i> taking it
into their own hands?

20:25.978 --> 20:27.745
Problem is, we don't have enough
leads yet to draw

20:27.747 --> 20:30.214
any conclusions,
let alone make any arrests.

20:30.216 --> 20:31.982
Well, next move is the Niners.

20:31.984 --> 20:33.817
Now, how do we stop them

20:33.819 --> 20:36.253
before we get any more leads?

20:36.255 --> 20:37.954
Ramon?

20:37.956 --> 20:39.222
What?

20:39.224 --> 20:41.490
Your old informant?

20:41.492 --> 20:43.893
I mean, we saw him running
with the Niners, didn't we?

20:43.895 --> 20:45.895
Might be our only way in,
plus Percy already has a cover.

20:45.897 --> 20:48.530
No way we get
a UC in any faster.

20:48.532 --> 20:50.499
I don't know.

20:50.501 --> 20:54.303
Just sayin', she's got both the
cover and the chops to do it.

20:54.305 --> 20:57.038
Well, thanks. I think.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.173
You think your cover's
still good?

20:58.175 --> 20:59.607
Yeah, I mean...

20:59.609 --> 21:01.777
I was long gone
when the raid went down.

21:01.779 --> 21:04.312
Besides, Ramon wasn't part
of the gang we busted,

21:04.314 --> 21:06.148
he was just my source.

21:06.150 --> 21:08.416
There's no way he made me.

21:08.418 --> 21:10.986
He could get us
valuable information,

21:10.988 --> 21:13.053
maybe even enough to keep
this thing from escalating,

21:13.054 --> 21:14.294
but if you're not comfortable,
then I don't...

21:14.318 --> 21:15.393
No, no.

21:17.459 --> 21:18.959
Gregorio's right.

21:18.961 --> 21:20.427
I'll do it.

21:20.429 --> 21:21.996
All right.
She has to wear a wire.

21:21.998 --> 21:25.099
We have to be able to pull her
out if things get squirrely.

21:25.101 --> 21:26.066
Agreed.

21:26.068 --> 21:27.401
Gregorio.

21:27.403 --> 21:29.002
You and Patton back her up.
Wait,

21:29.004 --> 21:30.503
why Gregorio?
Maybe because

21:30.505 --> 21:33.840
I've done a million
backups already at FBI.

21:33.842 --> 21:36.475
Don't worry, I got your back.

21:36.477 --> 21:39.846
All right, we'll work the case
from outside.

21:39.848 --> 21:42.148
You let us know
the moment you hear anything.

21:42.150 --> 21:43.283
Copy that.

21:43.285 --> 21:45.218
Go get wired.

21:49.023 --> 21:51.523
Just gotta say, I'd feel
a lot more comfortable

21:51.525 --> 21:52.958
if I were backing her up.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.059
Yeah, well, I think
you got enough

21:54.061 --> 21:55.560
on your plate
right now, Chris.

21:55.562 --> 21:58.931
Besides, as much as those
two bark at each other,

21:58.933 --> 22:00.632
they're good together.

22:00.634 --> 22:03.234
They just don't
know it yet.

I missed you, too.

You think...

23:43.531 --> 23:45.130
Yeah, she screwed him.

23:46.266 --> 23:48.466
No doubt.

24:01.256 --> 24:04.123
RAMON (over radio): I just...
just still don't believe it.

24:04.125 --> 24:06.159
Two years. What happened?

24:06.160 --> 24:07.659
Where'd you go?
Why'd you leave?

24:07.661 --> 24:09.428
I don't know,
I was just...

24:09.430 --> 24:11.963
dealing with some
stuff, you know?

24:13.666 --> 24:14.999
Stuff. Like what?

24:18.605 --> 24:20.972
Come on, I deserve
to know, Sunny.

24:20.974 --> 24:22.273
You and me, we got close,

24:22.275 --> 24:25.944
and then you just...
up and disappeared.

24:27.614 --> 24:30.280
You never even said good-bye.

24:32.251 --> 24:35.886
I know.
I'm sorry.

24:35.888 --> 24:37.687
RAMON:
It was probably a good thing

24:37.689 --> 24:39.389
you left when you did, though.

24:39.391 --> 24:40.858
Everybody got busted
right afterwards.

24:40.860 --> 24:42.860
Apparently, somebody
ratted us out.

24:42.862 --> 24:44.327
Yeah, but you didn't
get busted, right?

24:44.329 --> 24:46.996
No, thanks to you.

24:46.998 --> 24:48.564
How much did Percy say

24:48.566 --> 24:51.000
about this Ramon dude, exactly?
Not enough, obviously.

24:51.002 --> 24:52.501
SONJA: Yeah, but you didn't
do anything wrong, right?

24:52.503 --> 24:54.871
You were just building
bikes for them, right?

24:54.873 --> 24:56.538
RAMON: Yeah, pretty much.
Yo, looks like Percy's hiding

24:56.540 --> 24:57.673
more than just a hook-up.

24:57.675 --> 24:59.208
Neglected to mention

24:59.210 --> 25:02.044
that Ramon didn't get busted
because she saved him.

25:02.046 --> 25:03.082
You calling Pride?

25:03.106 --> 25:05.014
No, FBI. I got a bad
feeling about this guy.

25:05.015 --> 25:06.447
I want to know exactly
who we're dealing with,

25:06.449 --> 25:08.784
for Percy's sake.
Which means...

25:08.786 --> 25:09.851
if you haven't
felt the urge

25:09.853 --> 25:11.452
to hack into
the ATF database,

25:11.454 --> 25:13.155
get access to our
undercover ops,

25:13.157 --> 25:15.257
now would be the
time-- just sayin'.

25:15.259 --> 25:18.559
But isn't that illegal,
Agent Gregorio?

25:19.729 --> 25:21.628
Don't ask, don't tell, right?

25:21.630 --> 25:22.963
RAMON:
That really did a number on me.

25:22.965 --> 25:25.499
I didn't eat, couldn't sleep.

25:25.501 --> 25:27.268
You know I was riding
around Texas, Nevada,

25:27.270 --> 25:29.203
all the way out to California
trying to find you?

25:30.673 --> 25:34.374
Well, I'm here now,
aren't I?

25:38.546 --> 25:40.180
Well, it's better late
than never.

25:40.182 --> 25:41.380
(chuckles)

25:45.687 --> 25:46.853
(phone rings)

25:46.855 --> 25:48.321
Can't keep avoiding her,
you know.

25:48.323 --> 25:49.488
Yeah, I know, but
she can't keep

25:49.490 --> 25:50.589
calling all the
time, either.

25:50.591 --> 25:51.891
I gotta focus on work.

25:51.893 --> 25:54.759
Work isn't always
an excuse, Chris.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.095
How well you know this girl?

25:57.097 --> 26:00.232
Not very.

26:00.234 --> 26:01.800
I mean,
that's the problem.

26:01.802 --> 26:03.869
Look, you know how
I used to be,

26:03.871 --> 26:05.237
after Savannah's death.

26:05.239 --> 26:07.105
It was dark times,
sleeping around.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.373
It's not something
I'm proud of.

26:08.375 --> 26:10.842
And it's not who I am
anymore, either.

26:10.844 --> 26:12.476
But...
- (phone rings)

26:15.315 --> 26:18.382
I honestly don't
know what to do.

26:19.418 --> 26:24.088
Still, I can't
just... walk away.

26:24.090 --> 26:26.924
But I don't know if
I'm ready for all this.

26:26.926 --> 26:29.625
I gotta ask--

26:29.627 --> 26:30.927
you sure the baby's yours?

26:30.929 --> 26:33.230
Boy, he looks like me.

26:33.232 --> 26:36.532
And the math
definitely works.

26:36.534 --> 26:37.968
Then the only way to deal
with something like this

26:37.970 --> 26:39.169
is head-on.

26:39.171 --> 26:42.172
It can't be easy
for the mom, either.

26:42.174 --> 26:45.440
But one thing's
for sure...

26:45.442 --> 26:47.943
it's not something
you can avoid.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.379
Call her back.

26:50.381 --> 26:52.614
I'll see where
Sebastian's at.

26:55.953 --> 26:58.320
(exhales)

26:59.891 --> 27:03.958
Hate to pressure you,
Sebastian, all right?

27:03.960 --> 27:05.693
I'll take anything
you got.

27:05.695 --> 27:07.595
Well, what I got, I don't think
you're gonna like.

27:07.597 --> 27:09.764
I reassembled most
of the IED,

27:09.766 --> 27:12.200
and either your bomber's got
pristine Googling skills,

27:12.202 --> 27:14.002
or he's got
a military background.

27:14.004 --> 27:15.836
Okay, well, what about
the explosives?

27:15.838 --> 27:17.105
That's more bad news.

27:17.107 --> 27:18.506
It's a perfect match
to the sample

27:18.508 --> 27:19.806
you brought back from
the construction site.

27:19.808 --> 27:21.841
I mean, there's
no doubt about it.

27:23.779 --> 27:25.845
I don't want to believe that.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.447
Why would the vets
come back here

27:27.449 --> 27:30.951
after all these years
just to get sucked back into

27:30.953 --> 27:33.353
what drove 'em out
in the first place, only worse?

27:33.355 --> 27:36.222
Well, old grudges die hard.

27:37.325 --> 27:38.891
Nobody's done more
to support veterans

27:38.893 --> 27:40.626
than you have, Dwayne.

27:40.628 --> 27:41.961
You just can't
save 'em all.

27:41.963 --> 27:43.762
I know.

27:43.764 --> 27:47.766
Still, it's disappointing,
if it's true.

27:47.768 --> 27:51.670
Something like this stains
the whole veteran community.

27:51.672 --> 27:53.471
What are you gonna do?

27:53.473 --> 27:57.508
What I have to do--
arrest Captain Hogan.

28:09.456 --> 28:11.488
(conversation over radio
continues indistinctly)

28:11.490 --> 28:13.523
ATF says Percy was UC
on a gun-running pipeline

28:13.525 --> 28:14.724
about two years back.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.493
Easy Rider, he
just fixed bikes.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.996
He did the occasional run,
but he was a small fish.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.865
Percy played the player
so she could get in.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.634
That's it? Nothing else
in her case file on Ramon?

28:24.636 --> 28:27.337
No. In fact, she barely
mentioned him at all.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.405
Did you guys find anything
on him at the FBI?

28:29.407 --> 28:30.773
Just some petty stuff.

28:30.775 --> 28:32.075
Still doesn't change
my gut on the guy.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.476
Hangs out with too many bad guys

28:33.478 --> 28:35.311
without being dirtier
than Percy thinks he is.

28:35.313 --> 28:36.545
Love is blind.
(phone rings)

28:36.547 --> 28:38.481
Yeah, deaf and dumb, too.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.816
Pride, you're on speaker.

28:40.818 --> 28:42.018
Is Sonja okay?

28:42.020 --> 28:43.886
Percy? Yeah, why?
What's wrong?

28:43.888 --> 28:44.853
Hogan's missing.

28:44.855 --> 28:46.554
We just went to bring him in,

28:46.556 --> 28:47.589
found his bike in a ditch

28:47.591 --> 28:49.024
behind the construction site,

28:49.026 --> 28:50.425
fresh blood on the tank,

28:50.427 --> 28:51.659
tire tracks leading away.

28:51.661 --> 28:52.861
Put Sebastian on it.

28:52.863 --> 28:54.296
You think the Niners
kidnapped him?

28:54.298 --> 28:55.830
I don't know what else to think.

28:55.832 --> 28:58.233
We got a BOLO out on Hogan now,
and we're headed over

28:58.235 --> 28:59.234
to the vets' clubhouse to see

28:59.236 --> 29:00.435
if they know or saw anything.

29:00.437 --> 29:02.703
I don't like where
this is heading.

29:02.705 --> 29:03.937
If the Niners took Hogan,

29:03.939 --> 29:05.672
things could get ugly
real quick.

29:05.674 --> 29:07.208
We can't let Sonja get
caught up in the middle of it.

29:07.210 --> 29:09.877
I'm on it.
We gotta get word to Percy.

29:09.879 --> 29:12.579
SONJA (over radio):
The Niners gang just came up

29:12.581 --> 29:15.016
to Ramon asking
for something.

29:15.018 --> 29:16.984
Looks like something's
going down-- I'll find out what.

29:16.986 --> 29:19.219
Hey, baby, next
round's on me.

29:19.221 --> 29:21.554
Uh, look,
something's come up.

29:21.556 --> 29:22.688
I gotta jam.

29:22.690 --> 29:24.790
You gotta jam?
What do you mean?

29:24.792 --> 29:26.592
Who are those guys,
anyway?

29:27.729 --> 29:29.762
Nobody you want to piss off,
trust me.

29:29.764 --> 29:31.398
Look, we'll have
to catch up later.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.533
Are you just
gonna ditch me...

29:33.535 --> 29:35.501
after all this time?

29:35.503 --> 29:37.302
And here I was thinking

29:37.304 --> 29:40.139
you wanted to know
why I left.

29:42.609 --> 29:43.808
(kisses)

29:43.810 --> 29:46.412
What is she doing?

29:46.414 --> 29:48.780
Walk away now,
you'll never know.

29:52.552 --> 29:56.154
All right, you can come,
but, uh, you still carrying?

29:58.058 --> 29:59.768
The knife in the boot,
you still got it?

29:59.769 --> 30:00.322
Yeah, why?

30:00.346 --> 30:02.161
GREGORIO: Don't give up your
knife, Percy. Don't do it.

30:02.162 --> 30:03.827
Niners pat us down
and they find something bad,

30:03.829 --> 30:05.596
we ain't going nowhere good.

30:05.598 --> 30:07.532
Of course.

30:15.874 --> 30:17.740
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

30:17.742 --> 30:19.242
Forget that, we gotta
get her out of there.

30:19.244 --> 30:20.743
(radio static)

30:20.745 --> 30:21.844
The wire's dead.

30:23.348 --> 30:24.847
I'm out.

30:37.628 --> 30:40.696
GREGORIO:
Excuse me.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.913
GREGORIO: Did you get anything
from the vets?

31:01.915 --> 31:03.181
Other than they're
pissed off, no.

31:03.183 --> 31:04.397
Now, how could you
lose Percy?

31:04.398 --> 31:05.457
You're supposed
to be her backup.

31:05.458 --> 31:06.524
What are you talking about?
We didn't know

31:06.526 --> 31:08.259
she was gonna dump the wire.

31:08.261 --> 31:09.893
She had to if she was
gonna stick with Ramon.

31:09.895 --> 31:11.093
She could have let him
go without her,

31:11.095 --> 31:13.095
but she's a pro,
she found a way.

31:13.097 --> 31:14.230
Yeah, but she expected you

31:14.232 --> 31:15.565
to have her back,
like you promised.

31:15.567 --> 31:16.599
All right, that's enough.
Listen...

31:16.601 --> 31:18.067
All right?

31:18.069 --> 31:19.369
This isn't getting us anywhere.

31:19.371 --> 31:20.903
For better or worse,
Percy's put herself

31:20.905 --> 31:23.806
in position-- she's counting
on us to find her.

31:23.808 --> 31:25.308
GPS her burner phone?

31:25.310 --> 31:26.876
Burner phones, by nature,
don't track easy,

31:26.878 --> 31:28.943
but I'm working on it.
Well, work faster.

31:28.945 --> 31:30.479
If the Niners show up
with Hogan,

31:30.481 --> 31:31.746
I don't want her ducking bullets

31:31.748 --> 31:33.215
trying to save him by herself.

31:33.217 --> 31:35.717
(computer trills)
SEBASTIAN: Yo, anybody home?

31:35.719 --> 31:38.753
Please tell me you got
something for us.

31:38.755 --> 31:40.255
Oh, I do. It's a brilliant idea.

31:40.257 --> 31:42.324
I think you guys should
put a plasma in the courtyard.

31:42.326 --> 31:43.425
Sebastian!

31:43.427 --> 31:44.825
Right, okay, sorry.

31:44.827 --> 31:48.095
Um, so I finally
got the results on the touch DNA

31:48.097 --> 31:49.430
from the shooter's jacket.

31:49.432 --> 31:51.065
I ran it against the Niners,
which was easy,

31:51.067 --> 31:52.600
since they all have
a police record.

31:52.602 --> 31:54.134
What'd you find?
Nothing.

31:54.136 --> 31:55.436
No match, which means

31:55.438 --> 31:56.770
Fillibert's killer
was not a Niner.

31:56.772 --> 31:58.573
But he was wearing
a Niner jacket.

31:58.575 --> 32:00.474
Yeah, because he wanted
to make it look like

32:00.476 --> 32:01.608
the Niners shot him.

32:01.610 --> 32:02.642
Right, well, to that point,

32:02.644 --> 32:04.043
I also ran DNA recovery

32:04.045 --> 32:06.346
on the IED explosives, uh,

32:06.348 --> 32:08.248
but no match on any of the vets,
either.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.383
Checked both navy
and DoD records, too.

32:10.385 --> 32:12.719
So, what, you're saying
that neither the Niners

32:12.721 --> 32:14.954
or the vets are responsible
for all this?

32:14.956 --> 32:17.390
Well, you know,
I'm just a scientist

32:17.392 --> 32:18.790
cooped up in a lab all day,

32:18.792 --> 32:20.226
but if we go by the evidence,

32:20.228 --> 32:21.594
then yeah. However,

32:21.596 --> 32:23.362
the evidence also shows

32:23.364 --> 32:25.531
that the DNA
from the killer's jacket

32:25.533 --> 32:28.166
and the bomber's IED
are a match.

32:28.168 --> 32:29.702
Which means?
A third party's

32:29.704 --> 32:31.136
trying to set 'em both up--

32:31.138 --> 32:32.671
trying to rekindle the feud.

32:32.673 --> 32:33.639
But to what end?

32:33.641 --> 32:34.873
I mean, who stands to gain

32:34.875 --> 32:35.873
from them killing each other?

32:35.875 --> 32:38.008
What we have to find out.

32:38.878 --> 32:40.678
(sighs)

32:43.416 --> 32:45.149
You hear this guy?

32:45.151 --> 32:47.051
Just the right
amount of cocky, huh?

32:47.053 --> 32:49.387
20 high.
- I gotcha.

32:49.389 --> 32:51.522
Damn it.

32:52.891 --> 32:54.258
I brought beer.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.092
Yeah, about time.

32:59.665 --> 33:01.632
What's going on
over there, anyway?

33:01.634 --> 33:04.134
I don't know. How would I know?
I just build bikes, right?

33:04.136 --> 33:05.869
Yeah, except I don't
see you building any.

33:05.871 --> 33:07.404
(chuckles)
Come on.

33:07.406 --> 33:08.772
No, hold up.

33:08.774 --> 33:10.839
You brought me all the way
out here to paradise pit,

33:10.841 --> 33:12.941
I think I deserve to
know what's going on.

33:12.943 --> 33:15.511
I just don't want us to get
in any kind of trouble.

33:15.513 --> 33:16.779
We can't,
you're my lucky charm.

33:16.781 --> 33:18.614
I don't get in any trouble
when you're around.

33:21.185 --> 33:23.118
Come on, let's go catch up
in private.

33:24.489 --> 33:26.488
Think I might have something.

33:26.490 --> 33:27.889
I'll call you back.

33:29.359 --> 33:31.225
LASALLE:
Zoning maps?

33:31.227 --> 33:33.127
I've been trying to figure out
who else

33:33.129 --> 33:35.229
would want the Niners
and the vets fighting again,

33:35.231 --> 33:37.098
but I keep coming up empty.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.267
Then I started wondering
if maybe it was more about

33:39.269 --> 33:42.270
somebody not wanting the vets
back in town at all.

33:42.272 --> 33:44.237
Isn't that where they're trying
to build affordable housing?

33:44.239 --> 33:46.507
Broadmoor?
- Mm-hmm.

33:46.509 --> 33:48.074
After the vets were chased
out of New Orleans

33:48.076 --> 33:49.510
and McKinley took off

33:49.512 --> 33:50.811
with the FEMA funds,

33:50.813 --> 33:53.414
whole neighborhood
went into litigation.

33:53.416 --> 33:55.749
Been left for dead
ever since.

33:55.751 --> 33:58.084
City released it
six months ago.

33:58.086 --> 33:59.486
When Fillibert
got the permit.

33:59.488 --> 34:01.354
City approved Fillibert
because of the vets,

34:01.356 --> 34:03.856
but he wasn't the only one
with eyes on the land.

34:03.858 --> 34:05.891
Developers been
wanting to rezone it

34:05.893 --> 34:07.427
for commercial use for years.

34:07.429 --> 34:08.761
Vets beat them
to the punch,

34:08.763 --> 34:09.995
kept it residential.

34:09.996 --> 34:11.464
So, what, it's a land grab?

34:11.466 --> 34:12.465
Somebody wanted to

34:12.467 --> 34:13.733
rekindle the feud

34:13.735 --> 34:15.702
to get the vets
to leave again?

34:15.704 --> 34:17.469
If the vets leave, city
releases the permits.

34:17.471 --> 34:19.771
Yeah and Broadmoor
gets rebuilt,

34:19.773 --> 34:20.938
but not for housing.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.239
For profits.
- Mm-hmm.

34:22.242 --> 34:24.309
Well, any idea
who the developers are?

34:24.311 --> 34:26.110
I think I know.

34:27.147 --> 34:28.179
If memory serves,

34:28.181 --> 34:30.114
before McKinley ran off,

34:30.116 --> 34:32.650
he put Broadmoor up
on fire sale.

34:32.652 --> 34:34.485
If memory serves?

34:34.487 --> 34:36.053
Not the point.

34:38.358 --> 34:39.690
Keep going.

34:40.525 --> 34:43.661
Yep, I thought so.

34:43.663 --> 34:45.696
Company tied up in litigation--

34:45.697 --> 34:46.831
Aufiero Partners.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.931
Aufiero... Mob?

34:48.934 --> 34:50.668
Out of New York,
originally, yeah.

34:50.670 --> 34:52.168
Is that how you know
about all this?

34:52.170 --> 34:55.071
Not the point.
But Ramon might be.

34:55.072 --> 34:57.674
I think the Aufieros were
connected to that ATF case

34:57.676 --> 34:59.876
Percy was working on
when she met him.

35:00.846 --> 35:02.679
LASALLE:
"Extortion, arms dealing,

35:02.681 --> 35:04.347
drug running."
They all got busted,

35:04.349 --> 35:05.882
but where does Ramon fit in?

35:05.884 --> 35:07.950
He didn't get busted,
Percy made sure of that.

35:09.152 --> 35:11.353
Long story.

35:12.289 --> 35:13.689
There's got to be a reason why

35:13.691 --> 35:14.923
his name never turns up,

35:14.925 --> 35:16.558
but he always does.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.193
Got him.

35:18.195 --> 35:22.297
Ramon Vargas,
Tony Aveda, Leo Manzini.

35:22.299 --> 35:23.866
Specializes
in trafficking weapons

35:23.868 --> 35:25.533
under every name.

35:25.535 --> 35:27.101
And always
for the Aufieros.

35:27.103 --> 35:29.804
No wonder Percy didn't
turn him in, she had no idea.

35:29.806 --> 35:31.272
It could be he's the one
who's instigating the feud

35:31.274 --> 35:32.707
for the Aufieros.

35:32.709 --> 35:33.708
Which means, yet again,

35:33.710 --> 35:35.142
she has no idea.

35:43.719 --> 35:45.519
MAN:
Come on, Hogan.

35:45.521 --> 35:46.753
Hold on, hold on.
- What?

35:46.755 --> 35:47.921
Move.
RAMON: Don't worry about it,

35:47.923 --> 35:49.389
Move!
It doesn't matter.

35:49.391 --> 35:50.557
SONJA: What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

35:50.559 --> 35:52.191
Look, that guy is beaten
to a pulp!

35:52.193 --> 35:53.794
We got to do something.

35:53.796 --> 35:55.529
What? Hold on, what the
hell are you talking about?

35:55.531 --> 35:56.563
Never mind.
- Wait,

35:56.565 --> 35:57.798
you trying to
take off on me?

35:57.800 --> 35:58.732
-  Ow.
- Is that what's going on?

35:58.734 --> 36:00.399
- Hey, let go of me.
- No.

36:02.069 --> 36:04.169
Now, look,
I saved your ass once.

36:04.171 --> 36:05.370
You better not

36:05.372 --> 36:06.672
push your luck now.

36:24.732 --> 36:27.433
Ah, I keep losing the signal
on Percy's burner.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.501
Either there's a lot
of interference,

36:28.503 --> 36:29.902
or it's too remote.

36:29.904 --> 36:32.271
Are we at least headed
in the right direction?

36:32.273 --> 36:33.506
Well, it's by the canals,

36:33.508 --> 36:35.073
that might explain
the interference.

36:35.075 --> 36:36.707
I still can't reach her, either.

36:36.709 --> 36:38.510
Got it!

36:38.512 --> 36:39.644
Palomino Salvage.

36:39.646 --> 36:41.146
She's at the junkyard.

36:41.148 --> 36:42.313
All right, if you get her,

36:42.315 --> 36:43.614
you tell her we're on our way!

36:45.452 --> 36:47.785
LASALLE:
<i>Right behind you, King.</i>

36:54.393 --> 36:56.527
MORROW: Now we're gonna
settle this, Hogan.

36:56.529 --> 36:57.528
HOGAN: This won't be
the end of it.

36:57.530 --> 36:58.495
MORROW:
You're right,

36:58.497 --> 37:00.697
it won't!
(yells)

37:00.699 --> 37:01.765
Get it done!

37:01.767 --> 37:04.000
Put Captain Hogan
in the trunk, come on.

37:04.002 --> 37:05.702
Bring him over here,
come on.

37:08.474 --> 37:10.673
All right, now
get him up there.

37:10.675 --> 37:13.109
Get him
on the platform.

37:18.983 --> 37:21.184
It'll do.

37:21.186 --> 37:22.985
(gun cocks)
Drop it.

37:26.057 --> 37:27.189
Turn around.

37:27.191 --> 37:29.391
Slowly.

37:30.627 --> 37:33.027
At least now I know
why you left last time.

37:34.298 --> 37:35.763
You're a cop, aren't you?

37:35.765 --> 37:36.831
Aren't you?

37:36.833 --> 37:38.600
- Ramon, look, you don't...
- Move!

37:38.602 --> 37:40.102
MORROW: Vets think they can
disrespect us?

37:40.104 --> 37:41.836
(others jeering)

37:41.838 --> 37:43.770
Well, then, Niners,
let's do this.

37:46.775 --> 37:48.242
You really thought
you can get away with it?

37:48.244 --> 37:49.477
I don't know what

37:49.479 --> 37:51.345
you're talking about!
The hell you don't!

37:51.347 --> 37:52.879
Fire this thing up,

37:52.881 --> 37:55.015
we're gonna end this feud
once and for all.

37:55.017 --> 37:56.584
(hydraulic whining)

37:56.586 --> 37:57.985
(cheering)

37:57.987 --> 38:00.253
(sirens chirp)

38:05.793 --> 38:08.394
Federal agents!
Put the weapons down, now!

38:08.396 --> 38:10.029
Don't do it!
On your knees, Hogan.

38:10.031 --> 38:11.197
Let's go!

38:14.202 --> 38:15.535
Where's Percy?

38:15.537 --> 38:16.702
I'll go find her.

38:17.971 --> 38:20.305
Easy, Hogan.

38:22.209 --> 38:24.576
You don't want to do this.

38:24.578 --> 38:26.945
This man killed Fillibert,

38:26.947 --> 38:29.248
then tried to kill me.

38:30.684 --> 38:32.417
I'm not running from it
this time!

38:32.419 --> 38:35.085
It's not who you are.

38:35.087 --> 38:37.188
It's not why
you wore the uniform.

38:37.190 --> 38:38.589
Let us handle it!

38:38.591 --> 38:40.291
Like it was handled last time?

38:40.293 --> 38:41.659
Niners didn't kill your man

38:41.661 --> 38:43.794
any more than the vets
blew up their shop.

38:43.796 --> 38:46.797
Somebody's trying to
set you up, both of you.

38:46.799 --> 38:48.098
You pull that trigger,

38:48.100 --> 38:50.401
none of it's
gonna matter.

38:53.472 --> 38:55.405
'Cause we won't let you do it.

38:57.276 --> 38:59.576
Stand down.

38:59.578 --> 39:00.910
Please.

39:17.361 --> 39:19.662
Ramon, don't.

39:19.664 --> 39:20.663
Just give it up.

39:20.665 --> 39:21.763
Screw you, Sunny,

39:21.765 --> 39:23.799
or whatever the hell
your name is.

39:26.135 --> 39:28.102
Why'd you save me?

39:28.104 --> 39:29.937
Huh? Why'd you let me go
last time?

39:29.939 --> 39:31.939
Because I was stupid.

39:31.941 --> 39:33.541
Yeah, I thought
you were innocent, but

39:33.543 --> 39:34.942
I won't make that
mistake again.

39:34.944 --> 39:36.578
You don't really got
a choice this time.

39:36.580 --> 39:37.945
Don't I?

39:38.815 --> 39:41.849
FBI. Drop it or I'll shoot.

39:42.784 --> 39:44.418
Drop it now!

39:44.420 --> 39:46.320
I'd do it if I were you, Ramon,
because I promise you

39:46.322 --> 39:47.987
that girl ain't letting you go.

40:06.474 --> 40:08.674
I told you I got your back.

40:18.151 --> 40:21.353
(jazz music playing)

40:24.758 --> 40:26.190
Where is everybody?

40:26.192 --> 40:28.025
Pride's bar.

40:28.027 --> 40:30.194
He invited Hogan's MC.

40:30.196 --> 40:31.963
He'll probably end up
hiring 'em all,

40:31.965 --> 40:33.964
like he hires every other vet.

40:33.966 --> 40:35.666
Can he afford to do that?
- No,

40:35.668 --> 40:36.667
but that's Pride.

40:36.669 --> 40:38.869
It drives Patton crazy,

40:38.871 --> 40:42.172
'cause he does the books.
(chuckles)

40:43.842 --> 40:48.011
Hey, what's this doing
in Lasalle's desk?

40:48.013 --> 40:51.180
You ought to ask City Mouse.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.582
Country Mouse.

40:52.584 --> 40:53.949
Yeah.

40:59.424 --> 41:00.423
(drawer shuts)

41:00.425 --> 41:01.991
What do you know?

41:01.993 --> 41:04.694
Just that I'm not
gonna get involved.

41:07.064 --> 41:09.030
So, you okay?

41:09.032 --> 41:11.099
I mean, about... Ramon?

41:17.741 --> 41:19.941
You should know we
matched his DNA.

41:21.178 --> 41:23.945
Makes him both the killer
and the bomber.

41:23.947 --> 41:25.780
He was at the junkyard

41:25.782 --> 41:28.282
supplying the Niners
with nontraceable guns, too.

41:28.284 --> 41:30.250
Well,

41:30.252 --> 41:32.320
I sure know how to pick 'em,
don't I?

41:35.191 --> 41:39.393
So, now you know why I kept
avoiding the subject.

41:39.395 --> 41:42.061
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

41:42.063 --> 41:44.096
Yeah, well, you're
not the first girl

41:44.098 --> 41:45.898
to be blinded by
the Bad Boy Spell.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.400
Yeah, but most other girls don't

41:47.402 --> 41:49.168
almost get themselves killed
in doing it.

41:49.170 --> 41:51.471
True, some of us just
live a life of shame,

41:51.473 --> 41:52.905
kick ourselves,

41:52.907 --> 41:55.742
run, you know.

41:55.744 --> 41:59.244
We might have more in common
than you think, Percy.

42:02.149 --> 42:03.114
I'm all ears.

42:03.116 --> 42:05.083
McKinley, Katrina?

42:05.085 --> 42:06.552
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:06.554 --> 42:07.820
That would be the bad boy

42:07.822 --> 42:09.254
I fell for,
before I realized.

42:09.256 --> 42:10.489
No.

42:10.491 --> 42:12.324
Yeah.
- You're McKinley's wife?

42:12.326 --> 42:13.659
<i>Was</i> his wife.

42:13.661 --> 42:16.394
- Wow.
- Left NOLA right after I left him.

42:16.396 --> 42:18.195
Probably should have
left sooner.

42:18.197 --> 42:19.731
Although I'm guessing, like you,

42:19.733 --> 42:22.933
we both knew who they were
all along, we just...

42:22.935 --> 42:25.670
didn't want to admit it.

42:25.672 --> 42:27.872
Well, you live
and you learn, right?

42:28.742 --> 42:30.541
Hopefully.

42:32.678 --> 42:34.845
Hey, uh, this...

42:34.847 --> 42:36.580
wasn't us bonding, right?

42:36.582 --> 42:38.147
Oh, God forbid, no.

42:38.149 --> 42:39.449
Good.
