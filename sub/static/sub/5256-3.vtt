jean lafitte, he was just
a really badass pirate.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.215
Stabbing in weird,
fun new ways.

00:16.217 --> 00:19.284
Pirates are [bleep] good
at fighting and stuff,

00:19.286 --> 00:21.153
Is my [bleep] point, man.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.488
Sam the banana man,

00:22.490 --> 00:25.491
He is al pacino,

00:25.493 --> 00:28.060
But instead of cocaine,
bananas.

00:28.062 --> 00:28.827
[laughing]

00:28.829 --> 00:31.196
Louis armstrong was born
in the brothels

00:31.198 --> 00:32.765
Where all the jazz music
was playing.

00:32.767 --> 00:36.201
He was like,
"I want to play that music."

00:36.203 --> 00:37.269
You're drunk.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.871
- I'm drunk!
- Ah!

(man)
we live in the color portion
of<i> the wizard of oz,</i>

00:53.888 --> 00:56.221
And everybody else is in
the black-and-white section.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.124
It's all technicolor here.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.260

new orleans
is so [bleep] american

01:01.262 --> 01:02.127
Compared to everywhere else.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.096
You can't do the [bleep]
that you do in new orleans

01:04.098 --> 01:06.131
Everywhere else

You can't do it.

our entire history's

01:08.836 --> 01:13.238
We have a street right here
named after booze.

Oh, [bleep].

01:18.446 --> 01:21.013
Oh, [bleep].

01:21.015 --> 01:23.348
Oh, [bleep].

01:23.350 --> 01:25.184
Oh, no.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.419
[groans]

01:27.421 --> 01:28.153
Hello.

01:28.155 --> 01:33.725
Today we're gonna talk
about the pirate jean lafitte.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.827
[laughs]

01:34.829 --> 01:38.530
(allan)
our story starts
in the early 1800s.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.998
The economy is very bad.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.002
So the smugglers in new orleans
were these pirates,

01:44.004 --> 01:47.639
And the leader of the pirates,
jean lafitte,

01:47.641 --> 01:51.076
Was operating a major smuggl--

01:51.078 --> 01:52.811
Ooh, smuggling ring?

01:52.813 --> 01:56.181
So jean lafitte was operating
a "majoler"--

01:56.183 --> 01:58.250
Oh, no, no, no.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.686
Okay, okay.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.388
He was very smooth and suave.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.691
He was just
a really badass pirate.

02:05.693 --> 02:09.294
Governor claiborne of louisiana
is not happy about it.

02:09.296 --> 02:14.233
I'm putting a $500 bounty
on jean lafitte's head.

02:14.235 --> 02:14.900
Not his head.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.268
I don't want you
to bring me his head.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.003
I want you
to bring him in alive.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.571
But seriously...

02:19.573 --> 02:21.673
I'll give you $500
if you capture him

02:21.675 --> 02:22.474
And bring him in, okay?

02:22.476 --> 02:27.613
So, at this point,
the war of 1812 is...

02:27.615 --> 02:28.380
Happening now.

02:28.382 --> 02:32.217
There are british ships just off
the coast of new orleans.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.753
King george iii
sends a letter, saying,

02:34.755 --> 02:37.756
"dear jean lafitte,
I'm gonna attack new orleans.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.591
"I'd love for you
to be a part of this.

02:39.593 --> 02:44.196
In exchange, we will make you
a captain of the british navy."

02:44.198 --> 02:45.430
Lafitte says,

02:45.432 --> 02:48.400
I need a little time
to think about this.

02:50.203 --> 02:50.936
When he knows--

02:50.938 --> 02:53.172
I'm not going to fight
against america,

02:53.174 --> 02:54.973
Because he loves america.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.143
And then claiborne's men
show up

02:58.145 --> 02:59.611
And arrest jean lafitte.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.714
We caught you red-handed,
jean lafitte.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.815
You're arrested.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.050
We're going to arrest you.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.118
Jean lafitte surrenders.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.120
He's like, okay, you got me.

03:08.122 --> 03:09.721
He gets put in jail.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.691
So jean lafitte writes
a letter to andrew jackson.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.928
He's fighting the [bleep]
out of the british already.

03:15.930 --> 03:16.762
"dear andrew jackson,

03:16.764 --> 03:20.566
"here's all the battle plans
that king of England gave me.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.567
"maybe you could free me

03:21.569 --> 03:23.001
"and pardon me of all my crimes.

03:23.003 --> 03:26.805
Nobody can defend new orleans
better than we can."

03:26.807 --> 03:28.507
Major general andrew jackson
is like,

03:28.509 --> 03:34.446
Who is this pirate
writing a letter to me?

03:34.448 --> 03:35.380
Pirates are to be hung.

03:35.382 --> 03:39.318
I'm not going to fight
alongside a pirate.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.086
I'm here fighting the south--

03:41.088 --> 03:42.554
I'm fighting--
oh, [bleep].

03:42.556 --> 03:43.722
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.290
I'm gonna do this right.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.559
I'm not about to help you.

03:47.561 --> 03:52.598
I'm gonna head to new orleans
and protect it myself.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.134
Andrew jackson arrives
in new orleans.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.270
He's like, I've been shot.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.238
I have dysentery,

03:59.240 --> 04:01.773
Which is the worst category
of diarrhea

04:01.775 --> 04:03.141
That you can imagine.

04:03.143 --> 04:03.775
No big deal.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.111
I'll [bleep] on my [bleep] horse
all day long.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.546
His horse is like, huh?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.281
Okay, fine, you [bleep] on me.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.816
I'm an american horse.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.783
[laughs]

04:11.785 --> 04:13.852
You know what I mean?

04:13.854 --> 04:16.688
But don't let
my pooping disease

04:16.690 --> 04:20.626
Make you think that I'm not
gonna defeat the british,

04:20.628 --> 04:22.394
'cause I [bleep] am.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.129
Andrew jackson takes a look
at everybody.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.798
He's like, there's really not
any fighters here.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.001
What do we got, some nuns?

04:29.003 --> 04:33.705
And we got a couple
of business guys over here?

04:33.707 --> 04:36.441
I don't even know
what to do here.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.542
And they're like, hey,

04:37.544 --> 04:39.945
Major-general andrew jackson,

04:39.947 --> 04:41.613
There is that pirate
jean lafitte

04:41.615 --> 04:44.283
That's, like, interested
in helping you.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.551
Oh, yeah, well, okay.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.721
Yeah, here we go, yeah.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.857
All right, [bleep] it.
I'll talk to him.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.625
Jean lafitte finally gets
his chance

04:53.627 --> 04:54.559
To talk to andrew jackson.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.362
He says, listen, I've sent you
the letters, buddy.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.398
I'm telling you,
I got the goods.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.100
I got the ammunition,
I got the weapons,

05:02.102 --> 05:04.036
I got the men.

05:04.038 --> 05:04.736
You need me,

05:04.738 --> 05:07.973
And you're not admitting it
to yourself.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.677
And andrew jackson's like...

05:11.679 --> 05:14.112
[whispering]
I do need help from pirates.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.714
I'm [bleep] [bleep] up.

05:15.716 --> 05:16.915
I've got diarrhea.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.016
I don't want everybody to know

05:18.018 --> 05:20.719
That I'm asking
for a pirate's help right now,

05:20.721 --> 05:22.587
But, please, join me.

05:22.589 --> 05:27.092
[whispering]
okay, it's our little secret.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.126
Wink.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.295
And andrew jackson said...

05:30.297 --> 05:31.830
You're my guy.
Let's party.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.600
So there were 4,000 americans
versus, like, 10,000 british.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.602
And yet,
the british were not prepared

05:37.604 --> 05:39.805
For andrew jackson
and jean lafitte.

05:39.807 --> 05:43.709
And they just started
wailing on them.

05:43.711 --> 05:47.746
The pirates
are amazing fighters.

05:47.748 --> 05:48.747
They're doing stuff like,

05:48.749 --> 05:51.650
Shoot 'em from different
weird angles,

05:51.652 --> 05:53.919
Coming out of surprise traps,

05:53.921 --> 05:57.089
Stabbing in weird,
fun, new ways.

05:57.091 --> 05:57.723
And at one point,

05:57.725 --> 06:01.126
The british military commander
says to andrew jackson,

06:01.128 --> 06:04.262
Hey, you guys
are being very rude.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.263
And andrew jackson says,

06:05.265 --> 06:09.568
We're trying to get you
out of america.

06:09.570 --> 06:14.272
We're not playing
by your little rules.

06:14.274 --> 06:17.943
Arrow, arrow, arrow,
arrow, arrow.

06:17.945 --> 06:18.944
You know?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.346
[laughing]

06:21.348 --> 06:22.514
Yeah, not an arrow.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.283
Probably with a gun,
a "masket."

06:25.285 --> 06:26.485
[laughing]

06:26.487 --> 06:28.687
Muske--
[hiccups]

06:28.689 --> 06:29.554
Ooh, god.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.289
They won
the battle of new orleans.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.259
And andrew jackson's looking
at the area,

06:34.261 --> 06:37.195
And he's seeing
all these dead redcoats,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.131
Just like, whew.

06:39.133 --> 06:42.100
We really did a number
on these guys.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.269
We really...

06:44.271 --> 06:45.937
These guys...

06:45.939 --> 06:48.974
You know, we really killed
a lot of them.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.342
[laughs]

06:50.344 --> 06:51.209
And andrew jackson's like...

06:51.211 --> 06:54.579
Hey, everyone,
I had diarrhea, but we did it.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.581
We won,
because you fought so hard,

06:56.583 --> 06:58.250
And you were
so awesome out there.

06:58.252 --> 07:03.288
And so don't even worry
about all your crimes.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.556
I'm gonna pardon you.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.791
Lafitte says...

07:05.793 --> 07:07.726
Thank you, andrew jackson.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.060
All I wanted to do

07:09.062 --> 07:12.431
Was to show everybody
that pirates are all right

07:12.433 --> 07:14.733
And that we can be
true americans.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.600
Go be a pirate elsewhere.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.004
Come on, get out of here.
Get out of new orleans, guys.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.705
You crazy kids.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.908
But--but--but--but--

07:22.910 --> 07:25.243
But, um...

07:25.245 --> 07:27.946
(allan)
god damn it,
I felt like this [bleep]--

07:27.948 --> 07:30.215
The [bleep] point is that

07:30.217 --> 07:33.985
[bleep] pirates are [bleep] good
at fighting and stuff,

07:33.987 --> 07:37.789
Is my [bleep] point, man.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.824
Stay tuned

07:38.826 --> 07:42.427
For new "drunken history"

07:42.429 --> 07:45.864
From [bleep] pirates,
new orleans.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.366
- Is there whiskey in that?
- Yeah.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.436
Ha ha.
I'll have that.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.675
(man)
in new orleans,
we enjoy eating down here,

07:56.677 --> 07:59.644
Whether it's red beans and rice,
po'boys, shrimp.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.279
I can be as fat
as I want down here.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.615
Nobody gives a [bleep]
down here about that.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.483
We just eat.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.085
(gloria)
there's nothing like
gin and tonic and bananas.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.119
(derek)
that is a good combo.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.489
This is like
chocolate and peanut butter.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.456
You know what?

08:11.458 --> 08:12.657
Is this a thing?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.025
Could be.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.393
Not as good.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.561
No.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.996
Not as good.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.533
Look at this.
Lime, get--I hate you.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.034
Hey, you guys.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.336
Oh, boy.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.904
I'm gloria calderon kellett.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.672
Or glor--
I should do it again.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.573
No, just keep going.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.042
I'm gloria calderón kellett.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.911
Never been more latina.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.045
And I'm gonna tell you

08:34.047 --> 08:38.583
About
sam "the banana man" zemurray.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.151
So it's 1891.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.053
Sam zemurray's 14 years old.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.489
He's a russian jew, very poor.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.590
Has no formal education.

08:45.592 --> 08:48.326
And he steps off the boat
with his parents,

08:48.328 --> 08:51.463
And he's like, yeah, america.

08:51.465 --> 08:54.299
Let's make this happen,
american style.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.602
And one day, there's, like,
a traveling salesman

08:57.604 --> 09:00.338
Peddling exotic wares.

09:00.340 --> 09:00.939
And he's like...

09:00.941 --> 09:05.076
Excuse me, sir, what is this
penis-looking thing?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.778
And the peddler says...

09:06.780 --> 09:08.980
Oh, that is a banana.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.315
And sam's like...

09:10.317 --> 09:11.616
What is it?

09:11.618 --> 09:13.251
Oh, it is a fruit.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.219
He's like, what?

09:14.221 --> 09:17.556
And he tries this banana,
and it's delicious.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.958
And he's like, I want--

09:19.960 --> 09:21.259
I want everyone in the world

09:21.261 --> 09:24.563
To taste what's
in my mouth right now.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.597
Oh, you dropped your--

09:25.599 --> 09:27.499
Oh, my banana dropped!

09:27.501 --> 09:30.035
So he goes to where
the banana boats come in.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.237
They sort, like,
about to be ripe,

09:32.239 --> 09:32.938
Ripe, over-ripe.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.006
All the ripe bananas are thrown
into the ocean.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.408
And he goes up to them,
and he's like...

09:36.410 --> 09:38.310
You guys,
what are you doing?

09:38.312 --> 09:40.478
These are delicious
ripe bananas.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.047
And they're like,
oh, man, this--

09:42.049 --> 09:43.248
We'd love to not
throw them away,

09:43.250 --> 09:44.950
'cause you're right,
they are delicious.

09:44.952 --> 09:49.988
However, by the time
they get to where they're going,

09:49.990 --> 09:51.423
They're gonna be rotten.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.490
It's super sad.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.658
- Aw.
- Yeah.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.060
So he gets this idea.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.529
Why don't I buy
those ripes off of you?

09:57.531 --> 09:59.130
And they're like,
all right.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.067
And then he rents a boxcar

10:02.069 --> 10:04.069
On the illinois central train,

10:04.071 --> 10:06.738
And then at every stop,
he's like, what is up?

10:06.740 --> 10:07.672
And all the grocers are like,

10:07.674 --> 10:10.408
We're here, and we want
to buy your bananas, sir.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.979
He's like, I have nothing
but awesome bananas to sell you,

10:13.981 --> 10:17.248
Right here from my--zoop--
from my boxcar.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.783
Some people don't know
what the hell they are.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.352
Ooh, that looks
a little bit weird.

10:20.354 --> 10:23.588
And they try it,
and they're like, holy [bleep].

10:23.590 --> 10:25.056
This is bananas.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.358
He's like, exactly.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.325
You're welcome.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.027
He's selling bananas
left and right.

10:29.029 --> 10:29.995
Left and right, bananas.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.098
And that first trip,
he makes 40 bucks,

10:33.100 --> 10:35.400
Which is so much money
at that time.

10:35.402 --> 10:39.337
That's amazing,
how bananas were so...

10:41.474 --> 10:42.974
Forgot the word
I wanted to use.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.809
- [laughs]
- anyway...

10:44.811 --> 10:48.079
So he does this again
and again and again.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.348
And by the time
he's 21 years old,

10:50.350 --> 10:53.618
Sam, who's now known
as sam the banana man,

10:53.620 --> 10:55.820
Has made $100,000.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.489
Is that enough for sammy z?

10:57.491 --> 11:00.492
It is not.
He wants more, derek.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.526
So it dawns on him--

11:01.528 --> 11:05.597
Wait a minute.
I could just do this all myself.

11:05.599 --> 11:06.798
I'm gonna go to honduras.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.968
And in 1910, he's, like,
along the cuyamel river,

11:09.970 --> 11:12.570
And he's like, I'm gonna start
the cuyamel fruit company.

11:12.572 --> 11:16.541
I'm gonna buy a ton of land,
buy some ships,

11:16.543 --> 11:18.043
And I'm gonna plant bananas

11:18.045 --> 11:21.846
And I'm gonna, like,
build a railroad line,

11:21.848 --> 11:24.149
And I'm gonna get--
like, talk to the authorities

11:24.151 --> 11:25.050
And be like, hey, authorities,

11:25.052 --> 11:27.952
Is it cool if you totally
don't tax me a lot?

11:27.954 --> 11:28.653
Okay.

11:28.655 --> 11:29.788
And it's gonna be amazing.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.557
So he is controlling
his own supply.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.225
He's getting his tax breaks.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.060
Everything is awesome.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.828
He's, like, the richest guy
in new orleans.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.996
He can do anything he wants.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.099
He is al pacino,
<i>scarface</i> style,

11:41.101 --> 11:44.469
But instead of, like, cocaine,
bananas.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.404
[laughing]

11:46.406 --> 11:48.039
But then someone's like,
knock-knock,

11:48.041 --> 11:51.076
Sorry to bust in
on your big party.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.744
But, hey,

11:52.746 --> 11:54.679
That's making you
all this money?

11:54.681 --> 11:55.747
There's a problem.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.215
And he's like, what?

11:57.217 --> 12:00.285
They owe the british
a lot of money.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.455
They're taxing everything,
including your bananas.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.857
Sam's like, uh-oh,
what do I do?

12:05.859 --> 12:06.825
What do I do?

12:06.827 --> 12:07.992
Hold on, hold on.

12:07.994 --> 12:08.493
What?

12:08.495 --> 12:12.330
The former exiled president
of honduras

12:12.332 --> 12:14.566
Lives in new orleans?

12:14.568 --> 12:15.633
Amazing.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.569
So he finds manuel bonilla,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.804
The former exiled president
of honduras.

12:19.806 --> 12:20.939
And he's like,
what's up?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.807
Banana man,
maybe you've heard of me.

12:22.809 --> 12:26.211
How would you like to be
president of your country again?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.612
And manuel bonilla's like...

12:27.614 --> 12:29.447
Oh, let me think about it.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.014
Yes.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.182
If I, like, help you
be president again,

12:31.184 --> 12:33.718
You're totally gonna be, like,
cool with taxes and stuff?

12:33.720 --> 12:34.753
Yes, totally.

12:34.755 --> 12:35.920
So bonilla says...

12:35.922 --> 12:38.490
If we're gonna do this,
I need my dudes.

12:38.492 --> 12:43.595
And in walks lee christmas
and guy "machine gun" molony.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.030
And these guys are bad mfs.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.666

what mfs meant.

12:50.971 --> 12:51.936
[laughs]

12:51.938 --> 12:54.205
So lee christmas
and machine gun molony

12:54.207 --> 12:58.409
Are like, all right, we got
to get together an army.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.778
So he goes, and he finds

12:59.780 --> 13:04.015
The lowest, filthiest,
scummiest [bleep].

13:04.017 --> 13:06.184

13:06.186 --> 13:07.018
What's up, brothels?

13:07.020 --> 13:11.756
Stop [bleep] prostitutes

13:11.758 --> 13:13.424
Hey, help me change
the world

13:13.426 --> 13:14.826
And create a coup
in honduras.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.629
And he gathers them up
to go on this mission.

13:17.631 --> 13:22.367
So sam zemurray secretly buys
all of these ships and guns

13:22.369 --> 13:23.401
From the u.S. Military.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.103
They get off the boat,
and they're like,

13:25.105 --> 13:26.471
Oh, what's up, honduras?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.640

13:34.648 --> 13:35.847
Oh, we're dead.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.982
We're on the ground, dead.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.450
Egh, that's what happens.

13:39.452 --> 13:43.288
And they take over
the government of honduras.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.190
And bonilla, they put him
back in power.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.559
Sam says, hey, we're cool
with the tax thing?

13:47.561 --> 13:49.194
Bonilla's, like,
yeah, man, it's all good.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.930
This is how, like,
the phrase "banana republics"

13:51.932 --> 13:53.031
Is started, right?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.699
So this coup is successful.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.468
Sam zemurray fills the u.S.
With bananas.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.604
It becomes
the chiquita banana company.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.773

did he do some bad [bleep]?

14:01.775 --> 14:02.540

The karnofsky family
meant to him.

The musical "instructure"--

18:09.789 --> 18:11.255

18:11.257 --> 18:14.092
Pete davis taught him
