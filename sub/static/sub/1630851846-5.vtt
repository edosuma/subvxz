WEBVTT

00:04.743 --> 00:06.180
Ta-da!

00:06.223 --> 00:09.574
My outfit for next week's
annual Smith family trip

00:09.618 --> 00:11.185
to the dude ranch.

00:11.228 --> 00:14.275
When Klaus join Village People?

00:14.318 --> 00:16.712
Oh, my God, did you hear that?

00:16.755 --> 00:19.628
My precious Rogu's
first sick burn.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.325
But strong disagree.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.240
Klaus is working that outfit.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.937
Give us a little spin, Klaus.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.507
Yeah, yeah, now give us
an over-the-shoulder.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.554
Now give us, like, a...

00:32.597 --> 00:34.556
like someone deciding
what to get on the menu.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.950
Okay, I'm good.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.493
Does anybody else want
Klaus to do something?

00:39.517 --> 00:41.128
Rogu, Klaus can wear

00:41.171 --> 00:42.912
anything he wants to
the dude ranch.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.783
He crushes it there.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.481
I'm good at all their
activities,

00:46.524 --> 00:49.049
and I <i>love</i> eating
from the chuck wagon.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.790
They flavor the beans with just
the right amount of trail dust.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.140
Tons.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.490
Ugh, I hate all that dust.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.926
It fogs up my glasses.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.754
Steve is right, Rogu.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.148
We all have something we love
about the dude ranch.

01:01.191 --> 01:04.847
For example, I, Stan,
am excited to be reunited

01:04.890 --> 01:06.675
with the ranch's tequila mule...

01:06.718 --> 01:08.198
Tequila Joe.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.200
He's easily my best friend.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.028
Francine, isn't he
my best friend?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.986
Oh, for sure, Stan,

01:14.030 --> 01:15.814
but you'll see
when you get there, Rogu.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.512
You invited Rogu?!

01:17.555 --> 01:19.601
Yeah, Francine and I
have a bet going on

01:19.644 --> 01:21.622
whether or not he can herd
cattle better than a dog.

01:21.646 --> 01:22.995
Rogu's just gonna
eat the cattle.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.824
And the dog.

01:33.310 --> 01:36.096
I hope this is the year
I get to ride Tequila Joe.

01:36.139 --> 01:39.403
But Mr. S., no one has
ever ridden Tequila Joe.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.884
- He's untamable.
- Jeff, why is it

01:41.927 --> 01:43.166
that you only
ever open your mouth

01:43.190 --> 01:45.017
to shit on my dreams?

01:45.061 --> 01:47.237
Go inside. You're not coming
to the dude ranch.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.413
- Babe?
- Maybe next time no talking

01:49.457 --> 01:50.893
till we get there.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.245
Very funny, Steve.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.900
Now put me in my spot
on the center console.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.554
Can't.
Rogu's sitting there.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.774
My hat! My spot!

02:02.818 --> 02:04.602
He's taking all my things!

02:04.646 --> 02:06.648
Relax, Klaus.

02:06.691 --> 02:09.259
That outfit looks way
better on him.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.261
And no one's gonna see you
in the back.

02:11.305 --> 02:14.264
Ugh! Is <i>everyone
obsessed with Rogu?</i>

02:14.308 --> 02:18.312
Rogu! I almost
didn't get to say goodbye!

02:19.617 --> 02:21.880
<i>Et tu,</i> Billy?

02:30.411 --> 02:32.064
Tequila Joe!

02:32.108 --> 02:34.241
Sorry I was gone
for a whole year.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.895
My stupid family
won't let me live here.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.202
Huh, not as dusty as I remember.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.206
I'm gonna find a Kleenex.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.600
Ah, there's Nowell,
the main ranch hand.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.384
He's my boy!

02:47.428 --> 02:49.386
Rogu, try not to be jealous
when he calls me

02:49.430 --> 02:51.562
by my nickname... Buckaroo.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.085
Howdy, Smiths!

02:53.129 --> 02:55.305
Welcome back to the Octuple J.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.394
Hey, Buckaroo!
How you doing?

02:57.438 --> 03:00.354
So good.
Bet you're stoked that...

03:00.397 --> 03:03.487
And who's this little monster
you brought with you, Buckaroo?

03:03.531 --> 03:05.228
Ugh, that's Rogu.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.229
Gross, right?

03:06.273 --> 03:07.752
He's adorable.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.363
I'm gonna give him a nickname.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.452
Not Buckaroo.
That's what I call everybody.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.410
I know! Buckarito!

03:13.454 --> 03:15.456
Buck-a-rogu.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.849
That's great, but I'mma do mine.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.678
Let me show you all
to your cabins.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.377
I'm gonna bury you, suckarito.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.161
Suckarito.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.729
Haven't heard that term
in a long time.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.132
If I remember correctly,
it's where

03:29.165 --> 03:32.429
one guy chugs margaritas
while I blow him.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.691
And then...

03:33.735 --> 03:35.563
that's it I think.

03:35.606 --> 03:38.218
Yeah. Yeah, I <i>am
remembering that correctly.</i>

03:43.658 --> 03:46.226
Great job, buckaroo!

03:46.269 --> 03:48.837
Man, if you told me that someday
I would meet a fish

03:48.880 --> 03:51.796
who could talk <i>and</i> was good
at roping, I woulda...

03:51.840 --> 03:54.016
Whoa, look at Buckarito!

04:02.633 --> 04:05.245
Ha!
Beat that, Suckarito.

04:07.638 --> 04:08.726
Oh!

04:10.206 --> 04:11.599
Great shot, Rogu.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.775
You hit the cook
right in his noot sack.

04:13.818 --> 04:16.647
Cook?
I'm the got-dang sommelier!

04:16.691 --> 04:18.736
But your name <i>is</i> Cookie, right?

04:18.780 --> 04:20.434
Yes, it is.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.262
And you <i>are</i> the cook?

04:22.305 --> 04:24.873
- Yes.
- Then what are you mad about?

04:24.916 --> 04:28.311
I reckon it's the horseshoe
you threw into my balls.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.531
Ugh, you gonna hold
that over us forever?

04:30.574 --> 04:32.184
It was a joke, dude.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.798
Nine seconds!

04:36.841 --> 04:38.887
A new Octuple J record.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.586
Hold your horses! Buckarito's
at 15 seconds and counting.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.766
Wow, I wouldn't even

04:48.810 --> 04:50.812
think to do it that way.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.466
What's Rogu doing?

04:52.509 --> 04:54.032
What are we laughing at?

04:58.080 --> 04:59.666
<i>♪ Ladies to the middle
and back to the bar ♪</i>

04:59.690 --> 05:01.736
<i>♪ Gents go in with

05:04.042 --> 05:05.653
<i>♪ Now everyone make way

05:05.696 --> 05:07.829
<i>♪ He's the star
of this hullabaloo ♪</i>

05:07.872 --> 05:09.787
Oh, yeah!

05:09.831 --> 05:12.355
What does he have that I don't?

05:12.399 --> 05:14.052
Nothing!

05:14.096 --> 05:15.489
I guess he has
that Nintendo Switch

05:15.532 --> 05:18.709
with basically all the games,
but that's all.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.668
<i>♪ Do-si-do, two by two</i>

05:20.711 --> 05:23.497
<i>♪ Everyone kiss Rogu</i>

05:23.540 --> 05:25.020
Who am I kidding?

05:25.063 --> 05:27.065
He's a shooting star.

05:27.109 --> 05:30.286
I have to <i>do</i> something.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.506
<i>♪ Kiss Rogu once again</i>

05:32.549 --> 05:33.811
<i>♪ But this time,
just the men ♪</i>

05:36.510 --> 05:39.034
Nooo!

05:43.081 --> 05:44.081
Aah!

05:45.388 --> 05:48.435
Tequila Joe is gone!

05:48.478 --> 05:50.828
Someone cut his rope,
and he wandered off.

05:50.872 --> 05:53.091
I knew I shouldn't have
left him alone.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.703
But you just <i>had</i> to bone!

05:55.746 --> 05:57.226
A switchblade?

05:57.269 --> 06:00.751
That's probably what
they used to cut the rope!

06:00.795 --> 06:02.840
Does it say
who's property it is?

06:02.884 --> 06:05.452
It says, "Property of Ragu."

06:05.495 --> 06:09.151
Uh, I'm pretty sure it says,
"Property of Rogu."

06:09.194 --> 06:13.285
Wait, Klaus, how do you think
you spell Rogu?

06:13.329 --> 06:15.723
R... A?

06:15.766 --> 06:18.116
- What did you do?!
- Easy, buckaroo.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.510
Now, we may never get
to the bottom

06:20.554 --> 06:22.773
of who cut Tequila Joe loose,

06:22.817 --> 06:25.123
but it was definitely
either Klaus or Buckarito,

06:25.167 --> 06:26.864
charming little devil
that he is.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.605
So they're gonna have to go

06:28.649 --> 06:29.954
into the wilderness to find him.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.957
What?! I don't want to go
out there with him!

06:33.001 --> 06:35.395
Well, you should've thought
of that before you freed

06:35.438 --> 06:37.005
or didn't free Tequila Joe.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.355
Seems pretty obvious
it was Klaus.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.313
It's not obvious to me.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.403
Let the wilderness decide!

06:45.230 --> 06:48.146
Well, Rogu, this is quite
the bowl of shit sandwich

06:48.190 --> 06:49.539
you got us into.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.193
Me?

06:51.236 --> 06:54.109
Klaus one who frame...

06:54.152 --> 06:55.589
Klaus one who framed Rogu.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.547
Why do you talk
so freaking slow, bro?!

06:57.591 --> 07:00.028
- Rogu talk faster.
- What?

07:00.071 --> 07:01.725
You could do that
this whole time?

07:01.769 --> 07:03.553
Rogu learn English one year ago.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.425
Rogu careful no make mistakes.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.296
Plus, Rogu talk slow,

07:07.339 --> 07:10.647
charm pants off laaadies.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.740
Almost lunch,
and no sign of Tequila Joe.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.699
If we don't find a way
to track him,

07:18.742 --> 07:20.614
we're gonna be
out here all night.

07:20.657 --> 07:23.399
Tequila Joe!

07:23.443 --> 07:25.227
<i>♪ Oh, Rogu dance

07:25.270 --> 07:27.011

07:27.055 --> 07:28.622

07:32.800 --> 07:34.584
There you are!

07:34.628 --> 07:37.369
Now let's get out of here.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.762
Fastest way is to ride.

07:38.806 --> 07:42.374
But Tequila Joe
famously unridable.

07:42.418 --> 07:46.117
That's only because <i>
I've</i> never tried.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.771
Aah!

07:47.815 --> 07:48.946
Damn it!

07:48.990 --> 07:50.774
You spooked him, Rogu!

07:50.818 --> 07:55.910
Rogu die never seeing <i>
Ant Man & Wasp!</i>

07:55.953 --> 07:57.825
He's gone.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.522
Thank you, Tequila Joe.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.393
I'm free... Aah!

08:02.612 --> 08:05.354
Help!

08:05.397 --> 08:06.790
I can't swim in this much water!

08:06.834 --> 08:09.097
I'm used to way less water!

08:09.140 --> 08:10.664
Aah!

08:12.056 --> 08:13.580
Oof!

08:16.060 --> 08:18.062
Ahh, dry land.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.587
Dry land!
I need water!

08:20.630 --> 08:22.110
I need just the right amount
of water!

08:24.242 --> 08:26.244
Ahh.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.332
Thanks, Rogu.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.552
Klaus do same for Rogu.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.075
Maybe.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.207
Where are we?

08:32.250 --> 08:34.383
Klaus and Rogu lost?

08:34.426 --> 08:35.558
Yes.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.473
We're a long way from the ranch,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.693
and we'll have to work together
to find our way back.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.129
Yay!

08:41.172 --> 08:44.132
Klaus and Rogu go on adventure!

08:44.175 --> 08:47.483
Well, I don't like it
any more than you do, Rogu.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.094
For the talent show,
my brother and I

08:50.138 --> 08:53.576
are going to perform
the shark scene from <i>Jaws.</i>

08:53.620 --> 08:55.360
I don't remember a shark
in that movie.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.362
Everyone imagine in your heads

08:57.406 --> 09:00.844
John Williams' iconic theme
from <i>Jaws.</i>

09:00.888 --> 09:02.648
I can't hum it out loud
because Universal's lawyers

09:02.672 --> 09:03.672
are always watching.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.417
It's like <i>they're
the real sharks.</i>

09:10.288 --> 09:12.334
How can you laugh
at a time like this?

09:12.377 --> 09:14.075
Tequila Joe is missing!

09:14.118 --> 09:15.380
Stan, there's no need to worry.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.599
These mountains aren't

09:16.643 --> 09:17.948
- that dangerous.
- Really?

09:17.992 --> 09:19.733
Except of course for
that pair of

09:19.776 --> 09:22.387
mountain lions that are
terrorizing the region.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.607
Yeah, Klaus, Rogu,
and Tequila Joe

09:24.651 --> 09:27.044
would make a hell of a snack
for those two love birds.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.524
- Oh, God!
- I think they're

09:28.568 --> 09:29.525
boyfriend/girlfriend.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.613
Isn't that sweet?

09:30.657 --> 09:31.614
Well, I'm not gonna sit around

09:31.658 --> 09:32.963
watching a talent show

09:33.007 --> 09:34.791
while Tequila Joe is in danger.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.446
I'm gonna sit around outside
and worry about him.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.405
I did like your skit about
the farting cowboy, Gerhard.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.407
<i>Danke.</i>

09:42.451 --> 09:46.716
I feel like someone should tell
Billy that Rogu's missing.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.588
Thank you, Franny.

09:48.631 --> 09:52.243
Please call if you hear
anything.

09:56.683 --> 10:00.948
Are you safe, Rogu?

10:00.991 --> 10:03.211
<i>♪ Oh, where are you</i>

10:03.254 --> 10:06.214

kill the vegetable soup
from Olive Garden,

11:32.430 --> 11:34.998
and the baby back ribs
from Chili's.

11:35.042 --> 11:38.306
Rogu all.

11:38.349 --> 11:41.091
Wait, this is
where we fell into the river.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.135
We're almost home.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.226
Aah!

11:48.403 --> 11:49.926
This is exactly how

11:49.970 --> 11:52.146
that fortune teller in Reno
said I would die.

11:52.189 --> 11:56.846
Which means the Nuggets <i>will
win the 2026 NBA championship.</i>

11:56.890 --> 11:58.761
The people of Denver
will be so happy!

12:01.895 --> 12:04.375
Aah!

12:09.163 --> 12:11.121
Klaus hurt?

12:12.601 --> 12:14.211
I'm fine.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.344
But it's been a long day.

12:16.387 --> 12:19.173
Maybe we make camp and pass out
from the pain here tonight?

12:23.046 --> 12:26.615
I have to say, between that
hawk, that mountain lion,

12:26.658 --> 12:29.792
and that stink bug I killed,
I'm not sure either of us

12:29.836 --> 12:31.794
could've made it
without the other.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.405
Maybe you're not so bad, Rogu.

12:34.449 --> 12:37.408
That mean lot to Rogu
from Klaus.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.627
It does?

12:38.670 --> 12:40.977
Rogu look up to Klaus.

12:41.021 --> 12:45.416
When Rogu get to Smiths,
Rogu see Klaus have place.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.419
Bottom rung of ladder.

12:48.463 --> 12:51.379
But Rogu not know
how Rogu fit in.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.424
But everyone loves you, bro.

12:53.468 --> 12:56.732
Sure, Rogu naturally charming.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.214
But truth, Rogu like duck.

13:00.257 --> 13:04.827
Calm on surface,
but under, furiously paddling.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.874
Wow, I had no idea.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.181
You know, I'm glad we ended up
out here together.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.183
Rogu glad, too.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.621
And Rogu ain't "lion."

13:19.886 --> 13:22.497
Physical comedy, too.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.978
You're the whole package, Rogu.

13:25.021 --> 13:27.589
Rogu have idea.

13:27.632 --> 13:32.420
Now that friends, maybe Klaus
call Rogu "Bro-gu"?

13:32.463 --> 13:35.727
Dude, self-given nicknames
are embarrassing.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.861
That would be like if I told you
to call me K-Money.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.821
Oh, my God!
How good does that sound?!

13:41.864 --> 13:44.214
Rogu, you got to start
calling me K-Money.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.433
Aah!

13:45.476 --> 13:48.958
Rogu!

13:50.090 --> 13:53.441
Klaus help Rogu!

13:53.484 --> 13:54.659
I'll get the rope.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.274
Here's the thing.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.973
I have learned <i>a lot</i> about you
on this trip, Rogu.

14:04.017 --> 14:07.194
You have depth and feelings,
and you're useful.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.544
And I'm... not.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.981
I'm not worried you're
going to replace me.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.896
I <i>know</i> you will.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.986
Klaus not help Rogu?

14:17.030 --> 14:18.031
No.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.075
I'm betraying you.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.903
Rogu no like.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.514
We have words
after Rogu climb out.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.046
Why did you ask for help
if you could climb that easily?

14:33.089 --> 14:36.484
That! That's exactly the kind of
thing that got you betrayed.

14:36.527 --> 14:39.095
Uh, I mean, joke betrayed.

14:40.531 --> 14:43.534
Aah!

14:46.450 --> 14:48.322
Betrayal back on!

14:48.365 --> 14:50.498
Thank God for loose rocks, huh?

14:50.541 --> 14:53.196
Okay, bye forever, Rogu.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.808
K-Moneeeey!

15:02.510 --> 15:04.642
It's so sad that after
you saved Rogu from the hawk

15:04.686 --> 15:06.296
and that mountain lion...

15:06.340 --> 15:08.951
- Don't forget the stink bug.
- After all that,

15:08.995 --> 15:09.952
you couldn't
save him from the river.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.171
I tried.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.303
But he was swept away.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.262
He's gone, bros.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.046
We're just glad you're okay,
Klaus.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.526
Who cares about Klaus?

15:18.569 --> 15:20.571
Tequila Joe is out there,

15:20.615 --> 15:22.922
and he's bound to be
out of tequila by now.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.533
He's just some donkey named Joe!

15:27.143 --> 15:31.060
I can't believe Rogu's gone.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.715
Oh, we'll have a bar crawl
in his honor!

15:33.758 --> 15:35.499
Maybe do a <i>Great Gatsby</i> theme?

15:35.543 --> 15:37.762
Everyone can dress up
and act rich.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.503
You rest, Klaus.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.809
Try to eat.

15:49.644 --> 15:53.517
- Aah!
- You left Rogu to die.

15:53.561 --> 15:56.129
I-I had to!
He... he would've...

15:56.172 --> 15:59.523
Oh, God, what have I done,
pancakes?!

15:59.567 --> 16:01.525
Klaus, are you talking
to your pancakes?

16:01.569 --> 16:04.398
Here I am in the hallway
talking to <i>my</i> pancakes.

16:04.441 --> 16:07.531
- Mind if we join?
- Roger, I...

16:07.575 --> 16:09.794
Rogu didn't drown.

16:09.838 --> 16:13.320
He fell into a mine shaft,
and I left him there!

16:13.363 --> 16:15.365
So, Rogu is alive?

16:15.409 --> 16:19.021
Yes!
We have to save him!

16:19.065 --> 16:21.850
Klaus, there's no easy way
to say this.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.373
You should've killed him.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.246
- Wait, what?
- Look, I'm happy my son's alive,

16:26.289 --> 16:28.267
although I'm more than
a little embarrassed to cancel

16:28.291 --> 16:30.554
his Mardi Gras-themed
memorial bar crawl

16:30.598 --> 16:32.382
five minutes
after sending out the E-vite,

16:32.426 --> 16:35.342
but no one betrays Rogu
and lives to tell the tale.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.691
But he's trapped.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.432
His arm is pinned under a rock.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.651
So? He could chew through
that thing in two seconds.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.566
Watch.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.569
And our kind can regenerate
limbs practically at will.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.664
Hmm, it's usually pretty fast.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.188
Oh, well, it'll grow back.

16:55.231 --> 16:58.887
But make no mistake,
Rogu is coming for you.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.629
Rogu's already here?

17:01.672 --> 17:02.847
Could be a coincidence.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.155
Nope, that's Rogu.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.157
He loves shooting people
in the nuts.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.637
He's not wrong, it's funny.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.856
Oh!

17:11.900 --> 17:13.858
Great bit, Rogu. Keep it up.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.471
Take cover! Aah!

17:17.514 --> 17:18.820
What the hell is going on?

17:18.863 --> 17:20.387
Rogu's trying to kill Klaus.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.606
Rogu's alive?!

17:22.650 --> 17:25.087
Yep, Klaus left Rogu
to die in a pit,

17:25.131 --> 17:27.307
and now Rogu cut his arm off
and is gonna kill Klaus.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.918
You know, I had a feeling
that's what happened.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.963
Now he's pissed,
and he's gonna kill us all.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.617
We should probably say
our goodbyes.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.054
Goodbye, Roger.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.881
You're the only one
I'm gonna miss,

17:36.925 --> 17:39.971
and I can easily say you're
the funniest out of everybody.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.496
I think the shooting stopped.

17:44.367 --> 17:48.110
Rogu seek parlay.

17:50.286 --> 17:53.420
Rogu show he mean business.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.596
Now want Klaus.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.815
Let rest live.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.905
Welp, I know where I stand.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.864
Stay right there, Klaus.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.735
You can't have him, Rogu.

18:04.779 --> 18:08.870
Klaus is family.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.351
- I am?
- Klaus, did you really think

18:11.394 --> 18:14.136
we hate you so much
we'd let you die?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.138
You need to work
on your self-esteem, man.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.140
Your funeral.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.838
Rogu come back tonight.

18:20.882 --> 18:24.146
No mercy.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.148
See ya then, Rogu.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.150
Look, Klaus, it grew back.

18:32.023 --> 18:37.507
Klaus come to face Rogu by self?

18:37.551 --> 18:39.118
This is between me and you.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.076
They don't need to suffer
for what I've done.

18:41.120 --> 18:45.472
Klaus noble... and stupid.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.909
Any last words?

18:47.952 --> 18:49.519
Yes.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.391
When the family
wouldn't give me up,

18:51.434 --> 18:54.176
I realized
maybe they <i>do</i> like me.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.613
Which means there's room
for both of us,

18:56.657 --> 18:58.876
and I was a fool
to betray one of the most

18:58.920 --> 19:01.923
special creatures I've ever met.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.229
Billy?

19:03.272 --> 19:05.709
You, Bro-gu.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.147
I will face the consequences,

19:08.190 --> 19:12.107
but I want you to know
that I am truly sorry.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.414
Wow.

19:14.457 --> 19:18.026
Mean a lot to Rogu
that you learn lesson.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.506
Oh, good. I'm glad...

19:19.549 --> 19:21.290
Before you die.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.987
Seriously?!

19:23.031 --> 19:26.208
But I apologized,
like super sincerely!

19:26.252 --> 19:31.300
Yes, but also leave Rogu to die
in mine shaft, so...

19:31.344 --> 19:33.215
eh, uh.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.521
Aah!

19:35.609 --> 19:37.524
A second mountain lion?!

19:37.567 --> 19:38.916
I wonder if they know
each other.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.491
Told you I was good
at dude ranch stuff.

19:48.535 --> 19:53.235
Klaus save Rogu even though
Rogu plan kill Klaus?

19:53.279 --> 19:56.499
You're family, too.

19:56.543 --> 19:57.674
Klaus still die.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.980
Are you kidding me?!

19:59.023 --> 20:00.982
But where Klaus dick?

20:01.025 --> 20:04.115
Rogu need magnifying glass
to find.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.730
That is not funny, Rogu!

20:09.773 --> 20:12.472
It's little funny.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.579
O-Okay, it's a little funny.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.214
It's a little funny!

20:17.085 --> 20:20.219
I'm so happy you two managed
to work things out

20:20.262 --> 20:21.611
without anyone getting hurt.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.396
Uh, Mom, all those ranch dudes

20:23.439 --> 20:24.788
got shot in the dick.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.032
Can you guys give me a second?

20:29.358 --> 20:31.621
Well, we're on our way.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.972
I know I can't ride you,
but maybe I can...

20:35.016 --> 20:37.323
hug you?

20:37.366 --> 20:39.368

20:39.412 --> 20:40.978
