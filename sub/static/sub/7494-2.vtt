WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.370
Last time on
Make It Pop...

00:02.403 --> 00:06.674
Corki, who knew you could
sound so great with me!

00:06.707 --> 00:08.008
No-one else can
know about this.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.510
That won't
do any good

00:09.543 --> 00:10.611
'cause it already
went viral!

00:10.644 --> 00:11.745
What!?

00:11.779 --> 00:14.382
If you're going to be in a band,
people have to see you.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.717
You couldn't possibly
understand.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.986
I don't understand why Corki
had a meltdown from this.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.688
It's exactly
what I need to

00:20.721 --> 00:22.823
launch my plan for pop
music world domination.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.591
Uh!

00:23.624 --> 00:24.358
She's so selfish!

00:24.392 --> 00:25.226
Maybe you should've
asked her

00:25.259 --> 00:27.061
before you posted
our video online.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.063
Do you think she's running
away from someone?

00:29.097 --> 00:31.432
Or in the witness
protection program?

00:31.465 --> 00:33.567
Or on the run
from the law

00:33.601 --> 00:35.069
for robbing a
goodie-two-shoes store!

00:35.103 --> 00:37.037
Or she just doesn't
like the spotlight.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.107
Now you're just
being ridiculous.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.509
Anyway, it's her loss.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.944
If Corki doesn't want to be
in our soon-to-be world famous

00:43.977 --> 00:46.514
band, she just won't get
to ride in our private jet.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.216
We don't have
a private jet.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.317
If you keep saying
stuff like that,

00:49.350 --> 00:50.984
you won't get to
ride in it either.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.554
Mind helping me out?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.223
Look, Mr. Stark, my
brother has starred

00:55.256 --> 00:56.390
in several of
your productions,

00:56.424 --> 00:59.460
so I know how important the
school musical is to you.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.761
And I'm committed
to being the

01:00.794 --> 01:02.730
best leading man
you've ever had.

01:02.763 --> 01:03.864
Mr. Anderson.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.501
Please, we've done three
plays together, call me Jared.

01:07.535 --> 01:11.038
Mr. Anderson, I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.040
Once I've announced what
production we're doing,

01:13.073 --> 01:15.576
you'll have the
same opportunity

01:15.609 --> 01:17.245
to audition as every
other student.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.247
Okay, look, I
need this play.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.681
I've earned it.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.682
I've accepted
minor roles,

01:21.715 --> 01:24.752
without complaint, for
the past three years.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.587
You were quite
decent in those roles.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.555
That's right.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.890
Remember my tree in
Midsummer Night's Dream?

01:29.923 --> 01:33.127
I made the decision to have
a Bark Beetle infestation.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.662
Who goes that far?

01:34.695 --> 01:37.665
Now, I'm a senior.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.599
What the--

01:38.632 --> 01:39.867
Allow me to
help, sir.

01:39.900 --> 01:40.868
I wouldn't do that!

01:40.901 --> 01:42.870
(boom!!)

01:42.903 --> 01:49.277
*

01:49.310 --> 01:52.713
New year, new problems.

01:52.746 --> 01:59.052
*

01:59.086 --> 02:01.655
I'll keep all of you
updated on our next tour.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.723
We've never
toured.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.626
How could there
be a next one?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.795
Details!

02:07.828 --> 02:09.096
(knock on the door)

02:09.129 --> 02:10.731
(gasp)

02:10.764 --> 02:13.634
Ladies, I am very
disappointed to learn

02:13.667 --> 02:16.570
that Miss Chang has
requested a single room.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.638
Oh you have
single rooms!

02:17.671 --> 02:18.672
I want one!

02:18.706 --> 02:20.774
My point is, she
is staying here,

02:20.808 --> 02:24.678
and if I hear any more
complaints, beyond this feather

02:24.712 --> 02:27.815
situation I have now added to
this room's complaint list,

02:27.848 --> 02:30.718
I will make sure this
becomes a single!

02:30.751 --> 02:31.619
Got it!?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.687
I thought you didn't
have any singles?

02:33.721 --> 02:35.689
I think she's saying
we'll be kicked out.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.991
Ohhhh...

02:42.095 --> 02:46.334
*

02:46.367 --> 02:53.241
* Make it pop!

02:53.274 --> 02:58.346
* I can't wait, no

02:58.379 --> 02:59.713
* I can't wait

02:59.747 --> 03:01.249
* So make it pop!

03:01.282 --> 03:02.816
* We're bout to blow!

03:02.850 --> 03:04.084
* Until we drop!

03:04.117 --> 03:06.086
* Oh yeah we're
ready to go *

03:06.119 --> 03:07.355
* Ain't gonna stop!

03:07.388 --> 03:09.623
* When is it time
for the show? *

03:09.657 --> 03:11.625
* We make it, you make it

03:11.659 --> 03:15.896
* M-m-m-m-m-make it pop!

03:17.665 --> 03:20.268
I'm telling you,
forget Corki!

03:20.301 --> 03:21.635
We don't need her!

03:21.669 --> 03:23.337
I have the voice,
the charisma--

03:23.371 --> 03:24.372
The humility?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.239
Exactly!

03:25.273 --> 03:27.641
Who's better at being
humble than me?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.111
And you have the
fashion vision,

03:31.144 --> 03:32.880
and dance moves to
make this happen.

03:32.913 --> 03:36.149
I do have a couple new
looks that would be fun to try.

03:36.183 --> 03:36.884
Fun!?

03:36.917 --> 03:37.818
No, no.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.219
It's way more
than fun.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.422
Our group is
destiny!

03:41.455 --> 03:43.691
But there's
only two of us.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.992
That's a duet,
not a group.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.994
Look, we can argue
numbers all day long,

03:47.027 --> 03:48.696
but wouldn't you
rather talk about

03:48.729 --> 03:53.166
local gigs, online videos,
world domination!?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.436
Isn't that a
little ambitious?

03:55.469 --> 03:56.169
Good point.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.772
Online audiences
have no loyalty.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.308
We need a name.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.844
What about Sun-Hi and Her
Little Sidekick, Jodi?

04:03.877 --> 04:07.448
Can I see that
humble look again?

04:07.481 --> 04:10.751
You're right, you are
a talented performer.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.354
*

04:13.387 --> 04:14.154
Hi!

04:14.187 --> 04:15.723
I'm Caleb, Davis.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.024
Who are you?

04:17.057 --> 04:19.126
I mean, we should
know each other.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.294
I'm Corki.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.362
Are you okay?

04:21.395 --> 04:22.763
You seem nervous.

04:22.796 --> 04:23.464
Me?

04:23.497 --> 04:25.265
No, I'm fine.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.735
I also just drank coffee
for the first time.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.370
Listen, I just binge-watched
your online video.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.271
You and your friends
are talented!

04:31.305 --> 04:32.272
I'm a DJ.

04:32.306 --> 04:35.409
Your voices, my beats,
we could be unstoppable.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.277
I'm here to focus
on my schoolwork.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.748
But, you have plenty of
time to study for school.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.483
Five, six years
in some cases.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.452
This music is now.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.388
*

04:47.421 --> 04:48.789
It's-- very catchy.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.057
Exactly!

04:50.090 --> 04:53.226
I mean, with the right voices
this song could be number one!

04:53.260 --> 04:54.495
I'll think about it.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.866
I'm so sorry!

04:58.899 --> 04:59.867
Don't be.

04:59.900 --> 05:00.734
Rock solid.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.870
Jared Anderson,
senior class president.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.104
And you are?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.439
I'm Corki Chang.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.808
Are you the girl in that
pillow-fighting video?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.777
That was a mistake.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.111
A lucky one.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.113
You play that
fiddle great.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.449
I think you mean I
play the violin well?

05:15.483 --> 05:16.917
Multi-instruments,
I'm impressed.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.419
You should be in
the orchestra.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.421
I could put in
a word for you.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.424
I'm planning on being the lead
in the school play this year.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.427
People wanna pay to
see this profile.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.164
I have to get
to class.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.534
What!?

05:33.567 --> 05:36.804
Twelve-hundred views!

05:36.837 --> 05:38.372
The pillow fight
video is a smash!

05:38.406 --> 05:39.272
I'm web-famous!

05:39.306 --> 05:41.041
That's better than
being real life famous!

05:41.074 --> 05:42.075
Woo!

05:42.876 --> 05:43.777
I'm good.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.513
I think excitement
is dangerous for you.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.448
So is anonymity!

05:47.481 --> 05:50.117
We have to make
this band happen, now!

05:50.150 --> 05:53.987
*

05:56.457 --> 06:01.328
(phone ringing)

06:01.361 --> 06:02.195
(beep)

06:02.229 --> 06:03.531
Hello?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.499
I will keep an
eye on the place.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.267
See you when
you get back!

06:07.935 --> 06:11.138
Yes sir, the hole is
still in the wall.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.541
No, no, no, no.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.909
I can fix it!

06:15.943 --> 06:17.044
(dial tone)

06:17.077 --> 06:18.612
Hello?

06:18.646 --> 06:21.449
(beep)

06:21.482 --> 06:22.583
Kay.

06:25.318 --> 06:35.328
*

06:35.362 --> 06:47.608
*

06:47.641 --> 06:49.610
(coughing)

06:52.613 --> 06:54.948
Now this I can
work with.

07:15.469 --> 07:19.573
(applause)

07:19.607 --> 07:22.576
Give it up for the
next pop sensation,

07:22.610 --> 07:24.244
Caleb's band!

07:24.277 --> 07:26.246
(applause)

07:26.279 --> 07:30.551
*

07:30.584 --> 07:32.319
* Where are my girls at?

07:32.352 --> 07:33.621
* Where are my boys?

07:33.654 --> 07:36.323
* 'Cause we wanna make
some, make some noise. *

07:36.356 --> 07:38.626
* We don't even care
what the neighbours say. *

07:38.659 --> 07:41.595
* We're turning up loud
so come out and play. *

07:41.629 --> 07:44.665
* I'm a do it do it
do it do it alright. *

07:44.698 --> 07:48.636
* I'm a do it do it do
it do it how we want. *

07:48.669 --> 07:51.371
* Everybody knows that
it could get crazy. *

07:51.404 --> 07:52.305
* What?

07:52.339 --> 07:54.708
* You know we shake
it off real good. *

07:54.742 --> 07:56.409
* We're movin' like oh!

07:56.443 --> 07:57.711
* We're movin' like oh!

07:57.745 --> 08:00.714
* We move like you
never seen before. *

08:00.748 --> 08:05.586
* Believe, believe,
you're searching our names! *

08:05.619 --> 08:10.157
* Don't you know we're
with you 'till the end. *

08:10.190 --> 08:13.093
* So don't even pretend.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.029
* That you don't
want to ride. *

08:16.063 --> 08:17.598
* All together,
all together! *

08:17.631 --> 08:20.367
* We're making moves
so baby come follow. *

08:20.400 --> 08:23.403
* Where we go,
there's never tomorrow. *

08:23.436 --> 08:24.638
* Oh, oh, oh!

08:24.672 --> 08:26.439
* We're gonna
do it like. *

08:26.473 --> 08:29.509
* Oh, oh, oh, oh hey!

08:29.543 --> 08:34.682
(clapping)

08:34.715 --> 08:37.651
* You know our name, seen
our game, be cautious. *

08:37.685 --> 08:40.153
* Got a style so sick,
make you nauseous. *

08:40.187 --> 08:43.423
* We always come when the
crowd wants us to be there. *

08:43.456 --> 08:46.694
* We make it happen when
we on, now we all care. *

08:46.727 --> 08:49.763
* I'm a do it do it
do it do it alright. *

08:49.797 --> 08:53.533
* I'm a do it do it do
it do it how we want. *

08:53.567 --> 08:55.803
* Everybody knows that
it could get crazy. *

08:55.836 --> 08:58.572
* What, you know we shake
it off real good. *

08:58.606 --> 09:01.675
* We're movin' like oh!

09:01.709 --> 09:04.511
* We move like you
never seen before. *

09:04.544 --> 09:09.116
* Believe, believe,
you're shouting our names! *

09:09.149 --> 09:13.687
* Don't you know we're
with you 'till the end. *

09:13.721 --> 09:16.657
* So don't even pretend.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.660
* That you don't
want to ride. *

09:19.693 --> 09:21.394
* All together,
all together! *

09:21.428 --> 09:24.297
* We're making moves
so baby come follow. *

09:24.331 --> 09:26.634
* Where we go,
there's never tomorrow. *

09:26.667 --> 09:28.101
* Oh, oh, oh!

09:28.135 --> 09:29.703
* We're gonna do it like.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.672
* Oh, oh, oh!

09:31.705 --> 09:34.174
* Oh hey!

09:34.207 --> 09:39.613
(applause)

09:39.647 --> 09:40.848
Ahh, yup.

09:40.881 --> 09:45.886
(phone ringing)

09:45.919 --> 09:47.621
(beep)

09:47.655 --> 09:48.722
Hello?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.057
Oh, sir!

09:50.090 --> 09:53.326
No, no, I know the hole has
gotten bigger, but I'll fix it.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.162
I promise.

09:55.195 --> 09:55.663
He-- hello?

09:55.696 --> 09:56.596
Oh, okay.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.397
(beep)

10:02.602 --> 10:03.837
This is a
biology lab.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.405
Perfect, right!?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.174
Nobody wants to be here.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.309
We'll have it all
to ourselves.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.944
Could you guys
keep it down please?

10:10.978 --> 10:12.545
I'm actually
studying.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.381
Great, she's
stalking me.

10:14.414 --> 10:17.550
Your imagination goes beyond
your delusions of grandeur.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.352
Yes, it does.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.688
Wait, what does
that mean?

10:20.721 --> 10:21.621
You don't
wanna know.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.891
Look, Corki, we need
a place to rehearse,

10:23.924 --> 10:26.359
and this is the only place
that was empty.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.628
Well I need a place to
study the principles

10:28.662 --> 10:30.898
of microbiology and
cellular respiration.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.566
And you have to
do that in a lab?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.502
Come on Jodi,
let's rehearse.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.473
Don't bother us, and
we won't bother you.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.813
* Where I'm
meant to be. *

10:45.846 --> 10:48.682
* I'm meant to be.

10:48.716 --> 10:53.687
* Now, I am here,
where I'm meant to be. *

10:53.721 --> 10:55.622
* I'm meant to be.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.325
I just had a vision
of what we could be.

10:58.358 --> 10:58.625
We?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.559
Us!

10:59.592 --> 11:01.594
Sun-Hi, me,
you?

11:01.628 --> 11:02.395
And Corki.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.230
Corki?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.765
She's amazing.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.666
She had her chance,

11:06.700 --> 11:08.936
and she chose "common sense"
over fame and fortune.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.938
So now she has
to live with the

11:10.971 --> 11:13.006
consequences of her
terrible decision.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.107
I'm telling you,

11:14.141 --> 11:16.476
Corki would take this
group to a whole new level.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.677
There's no group.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.012
There's just me,
and Sun-Hi.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.249
If Corki doesn't want to
join, we can't make her.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.917
That's right,
you can't.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.253
Now if you'll
excuse me.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.588
My fungus is
calling.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.558
Well good luck studying
in our rehearsal space.

11:31.591 --> 11:40.433
(singing)

11:40.467 --> 11:44.371
Good luck rehearsing
in my study space.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.407
Oh, ew!

11:47.440 --> 11:48.375
Oh!

11:48.408 --> 11:49.142
Oh that's--

11:49.176 --> 11:50.778
I think it's safe
to say that

11:50.811 --> 11:53.013
there is a fungus
among us.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.683
What is going
on here!?

11:56.716 --> 11:57.851
What is that stench?

11:57.885 --> 11:59.319
It's Corki's
experiment!

11:59.352 --> 12:00.620
She's trying to
stink us out.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.524
This lab is strictly for
experiments, not singing.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.092
We can explain--

12:05.125 --> 12:06.093
Our band was
rehearse--

12:06.126 --> 12:07.060
Band!?

12:07.094 --> 12:09.729
Please tell me you're
not a part of this.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.331
I was just
studying.

12:11.364 --> 12:15.803
Only school-sanctioned
activities on school property.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.370
No matter how stinky.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.972
I don't want to
see your band,

12:19.006 --> 12:21.508
or hear a single note
of it, ever again.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.611
*

12:24.912 --> 12:26.413
*

12:26.446 --> 12:28.681
If we have no rehearsal
space, we have no band!

12:28.715 --> 12:31.985
If we have no band, we have no
way to achieve world domination!

12:32.019 --> 12:33.987
And you know how I
feel about people

12:34.021 --> 12:36.056
getting in the way of my
world domination.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.725
I'm beginning to, yes.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.527
It's all Corki's fault.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.864
Well, to be fair, it's
kind of your fault too.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.132
Listen, I saw
you first!

12:45.165 --> 12:47.134
That means you have
to side with me,

12:47.167 --> 12:50.370
on all of our
roommate fights.

12:50.403 --> 13:01.481
(violin playing)

13:01.514 --> 13:04.017
(clapping)

13:04.051 --> 13:06.820
Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was here.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.422
You really are great.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.892
The orchestra would
be lucky to have you.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.894
I'm pretty busy with
all my other schoolwork.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.896
Take my advice,
spreading yourself

13:15.929 --> 13:18.598
too thin is one of the
things colleges love.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.101
And, besides, if you
were in the orchestra,

13:21.134 --> 13:23.436
we could get to know
each other better.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.505
I'll set it up with
Mr. Stark, okay?

13:25.538 --> 13:26.806
You're very
kind.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.041
I know.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.879
Some people tell me I'm too
kind, but I just say, whatever.

13:31.912 --> 13:38.151
If I can make someone's
life better, who am I not to?

13:38.185 --> 13:38.986
Corki!

13:39.019 --> 13:40.120
Excuse us!

13:40.153 --> 13:42.222
She was
listening to me.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.356
Okay, but this
is important.

13:43.390 --> 13:47.727
You really need to reconsider
that thing with Sun-Hi.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.862
Uh, what thing?

13:48.896 --> 13:49.562
There's no thing.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.164
But there could
be a thing!

13:51.198 --> 13:52.565
There should
be a thing!

13:52.599 --> 13:54.034
You have to
apologize.

13:54.067 --> 13:57.237
Even if I wanted to, all
Sun-Hi cares about is herself.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.607
I could never talk
her into anything.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.877
*

14:03.911 --> 14:05.879
Corki, would you
try this on for me?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.647
I wanna see it
on a human.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.082
So why ask her?

14:09.116 --> 14:10.583
Maybe she wants
to ask someone

14:10.617 --> 14:12.953
who's actually capable
of being helpful.

14:12.986 --> 14:13.386
That's it!

14:13.420 --> 14:14.221
It's go time!

14:14.254 --> 14:14.988
You and me!

14:15.022 --> 14:15.755
Stop!

14:15.788 --> 14:17.958
I don't want blood
on my dress.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.226
That's a dress?

14:19.259 --> 14:20.560
I can see it.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.197
We lost our rehearsal
space because of her.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.699
We have no idea who she
is, where she's from,

14:26.733 --> 14:28.701
or why the principal
sucks up to her.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.237
Maybe you're
just not used to

14:30.270 --> 14:32.105
someone who's life isn't
always on display.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.106
Huh!

14:33.140 --> 14:35.075
People need to
know what I'm doing.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.643
It fulfills them.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.777
Would you two
stop arguing.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.848
I'll do better than that,
I'll stop talking to her.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.017
I can stop
talking too.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.685
Maybe.

14:45.718 --> 14:53.660
*

14:53.693 --> 14:56.696
Jodi, could you please as
Sun-Hi why she feels it's

14:56.729 --> 15:00.667
appropriate to use my
hairbrush without asking?

15:00.700 --> 15:01.901
Really?

15:01.935 --> 15:03.136
This is what
we're doing?

15:04.804 --> 15:07.174
Sun-Hi why are you
using Corki's brush?

15:07.207 --> 15:10.110
Jodi, tell our mystery
friend that in this country,

15:10.143 --> 15:11.945
it's part of the
roommate code.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.114
All personal hygiene items,
clothes, and homework

15:14.147 --> 15:16.216
assignments are to be
shared and copied at will.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.185
Oh, also tell
her she's out of

15:18.218 --> 15:21.888
the very expense
perfume she brought.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.226
Jodi, please tell Sun-Hi that
her code is as ridiculous

15:26.259 --> 15:30.730
as her ideas of becoming a
social media created pop star.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.199
I don't wanna
tell her that.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.769
Freshmen,
please leave.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.105
Can we just
have a minute?

15:38.138 --> 15:38.972
No.

15:39.006 --> 15:39.772
You can't.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.208
Out!

15:41.241 --> 15:46.279
These noobs are
so intense.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.281
Why are you so
angry with me?

15:48.315 --> 15:49.349
You don't
even know me.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.118
But I know
people like you.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.285
You're the
perfect kid.

15:52.319 --> 15:56.756
Good grades, always do what
you're told, never wrong.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.758
You're the daughter my
parents always wanted.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.261
Ooh this just
took a turn.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.963
I'm here because
I've been kicked

16:03.997 --> 16:05.999
out of every school
I ever went to.

16:06.033 --> 16:09.102
This is an amazing chance
for me to live my life.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.172
Live my dream, and make
something of myself.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.241
Look, I really need
to go to the--

16:14.274 --> 16:15.142
Out!

16:15.175 --> 16:16.276
No choice.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.710
To the boys
bathroom.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.778
Boys?

16:18.811 --> 16:22.882
But it's so icky
and yucky and gross!

16:22.915 --> 16:24.351
And yucky!

16:24.384 --> 16:26.786
You already said
yucky, Heather.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.289
All my life, I've been
told what's best for me,

16:29.322 --> 16:31.124
and I've done
exactly that.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.926
Music lessons,
ballet, study hard.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.696
I had to be the best, or
it wasn't good enough.

16:36.729 --> 16:40.100
I'm here, because it's where
my father thinks I should be.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.370
But what about
what you want?

16:43.403 --> 16:47.207
I just want to do something
great with my life.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.210
Looks like we all
want the same thing.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.312
Can we just
start over?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.447
Sun-Hi, meet
Corki.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.683
Corki, Sun-Hi.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.285
* Even though we're tight.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.253
* Don't see eye-to-eye.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.322
* I don't wanna fight.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.257
* Can't we let
it slide? *

17:04.291 --> 17:06.259
* Round and round
in circles. *

17:06.293 --> 17:08.095
* It all ends
the same. *

17:08.128 --> 17:10.063
* But it's always worth it.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.099
* Friends will never change.

17:12.132 --> 17:16.035
* We'll end up
right where we began. *

17:16.069 --> 17:17.904
* Bring it from the start.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.906
* Time to take a stand.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.810
* We're still gonna be
the best of friends. *

17:23.843 --> 17:27.980
* Wake up, make up,
that's the way we blend! *

17:28.014 --> 17:29.416
* My girls!

17:29.449 --> 17:31.418
* We're all on
the same team. *

17:31.451 --> 17:33.220
* My girls!

17:33.253 --> 17:35.388
* We're not here to play.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.290
* My girls!

17:37.324 --> 17:39.159
* Living for the
same dream. *

17:39.192 --> 17:40.960
* My girls!

17:40.993 --> 17:43.130
* Every day-ay-ay-ay!

17:43.163 --> 17:44.397
* My girls!

17:44.431 --> 17:47.100
If I don't see it,
there's no problem.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.801
* My girls!

17:48.835 --> 17:50.937
* Na na na na na.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.505
* We're one and
the same. *

17:52.539 --> 17:54.374
* Separate in style.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.176
* But I see your game.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.345
* I know you
that is why. *

17:58.378 --> 18:00.180
* When you give
it good. *

18:00.213 --> 18:02.249
* I can give it back.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.217
* You get on my nerves.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.553
* But we're still
on the same track. *

18:06.586 --> 18:10.157
* We'll end up
right where we began. *

18:10.190 --> 18:12.091
* Bring it from the start.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.227
* Time to take a stand.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.964
* We're still gonna be
the best of friends. *

18:17.997 --> 18:21.968
* Wake up, make up,
that's the way we blend! *

18:22.001 --> 18:23.803
* My girls!

18:23.836 --> 18:25.838
* We're all on
the same team. *

18:25.872 --> 18:27.274
* My girls!

18:27.307 --> 18:29.242
* We're not here to play.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.244
* My girls!

18:31.278 --> 18:33.546
* Living for the same dream.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.581
* My girls!

18:34.614 --> 18:37.517
* Every day-ay-ay-ay!

18:37.550 --> 18:39.419
* We're the same,
that's all it's ever been. *

18:39.452 --> 18:41.254
* Way closer than all
our other friends. *

18:41.288 --> 18:43.089
* You got me and
I got you. *

18:43.122 --> 18:45.258
* We fight but in the
end we stick like glue. *

18:45.292 --> 18:46.959
* Nothing now can
break us down. *

18:46.993 --> 18:48.895
* We run this school,
we'll rule this town. *

18:48.928 --> 18:51.097
* Across this land,
around the world. *

18:51.130 --> 18:53.065
* Better watch out
for me and my girls. *

18:53.099 --> 18:54.901
* My girls.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.069
* No, no, no, no.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.205
* My girls!

18:58.238 --> 19:00.907
* Every day-ay-ay-ay!

19:00.940 --> 19:02.209
* My girls!

19:02.242 --> 19:04.377
* We're all on
the same team. *

19:04.411 --> 19:06.213
* My girls!

19:06.246 --> 19:08.415
* We're not here to play.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.317
* My girls!

19:10.350 --> 19:12.285
* Living for the
same dream. *

19:12.319 --> 19:16.623
* My girls!
Every day-ay-ay-ay! *

19:16.656 --> 19:18.325
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.660
You're right, when Corki
sings, we blow up!

19:20.693 --> 19:21.661
I guess we both have
things we need to work on.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.531
I could stand to be a
little more open minded,

19:24.564 --> 19:25.898
and you could
stand to be--

19:25.932 --> 19:27.534
So it's settled,
Corki's in the band.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.303
I was going to say you could
stand to be a better listener.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.272
That'll be a work
in progress.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.674
Now, we just need a
place to rehearse.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.443
I think I have
just the spot.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.579
*

19:42.349 --> 19:43.650
The roller rink?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.218
I practically
manage the place.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.220
I'm changing it into
a teen dance club.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.555
You guys can
play there.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.290
In front of people?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.225
On a real stage?

19:52.259 --> 19:53.926
They used to have
live performances

19:53.960 --> 19:55.061
while people were
rollerskating.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.363
And I found
the stage.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.197
And we can rehearse
whenever we want?

19:58.231 --> 20:00.333
Of course we can
rehearse there!

20:00.367 --> 20:02.068
Caleb's the boss!

20:02.101 --> 20:03.303
Thanks Caleb!

20:08.508 --> 20:09.576
I'm not the boss.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.515
Maybe Caleb
is a genius.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.115
Who knows.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.450
His beats
are good.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.286
I think he's
kind of cute.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.953
I'm still not
sure about this.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.223
Caleb?

20:25.458 --> 20:26.593
Heh, heh.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.461
This is the club
you manage?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.196
Why are you
scrubbing the floor?

20:30.229 --> 20:31.564
Where's the stage?

20:31.598 --> 20:34.334
Alright, so
here's the thing.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.136
It's not actually
a club yet.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.205
And I'm not exactly
the manager.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.474
And technically I have
no power here whatsoever.

20:41.508 --> 20:44.043
You lied to us!?

20:44.076 --> 20:47.614
I prefer to think of it as
dreaming in a way that is big

20:47.647 --> 20:49.449
and doesn't necessarily
line up with reality.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.352
Caleb, this is serious!

20:52.385 --> 20:54.454
With no rehearsal
space, there's no band.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.357
With no band, Sun-Hi
can't be the star.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.191
And if Sun-Hi can't
be the star--

21:02.762 --> 21:04.497
Corki: Is this normal?

21:04.531 --> 21:05.732
For Sun-Hi?

21:05.765 --> 21:06.566
Yes.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.034
Is she gonna
explode or--

21:08.067 --> 21:11.237
(screaming)

21:12.572 --> 21:14.307
You know, if we
could bottle that,

21:14.341 --> 21:16.509
we'd have an alternative
source of energy.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.745
Why don't you go
work on that Corki?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.413
Great idea.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.181
So we've all
moved on then.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.182
Not at all.

21:23.215 --> 21:27.086
This club is
disappointing.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.121
Way to kill the
dream, Caleb.
