00:14.837 --> 00:16.770
The victim from the scene
I just came from.

00:16.805 --> 00:19.673

Wallet's in her purse.

01:25.908 --> 01:27.741
They didn't want anything but Maura.

01:27.776 --> 01:29.476
Look, we got roadblocks
at all the major thoroughfares.

01:29.511 --> 01:32.412
We got every camera, public and
private, in the neighborhood.

01:32.448 --> 01:34.214
All units that are available
are on the way.

01:34.249 --> 01:35.749

we can find.

01:35.784 --> 01:37.751
What was she doin' here?

01:37.786 --> 01:39.853
I spoke to dispatch. There was
no incident at this location.

01:39.888 --> 01:42.756
Obviously, she thought there was.
She brought her medical bag.

01:42.791 --> 01:44.224
Somebody made her think there was.

01:44.259 --> 01:46.426
[siren continues wailing,

01:46.462 --> 01:48.295
- Can I touch that right now?
- Sure.

01:48.330 --> 01:51.465
Uh, this isn't official.
Must've got it at a party shop.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.751
I'll bet he picked this
location because there wouldn't

01:53.752 --> 01:56.002
be any looky-loos to give it
away as a fake crime scene.

01:56.038 --> 01:58.171
Guys, the last call that she got

01:58.207 --> 02:01.241
before I tried her was from
an internal B.P.D. number.

02:01.386 --> 02:03.286
You think someone
from the department

02:03.322 --> 02:05.555
- is involved with this?
- Get back to headquarters.

02:05.591 --> 02:08.279
You find out where that call came from.

02:10.461 --> 02:13.363
There's a black smudge there.
Might be a footprint.

02:13.398 --> 02:17.400
- If I wasn't so concentrated on Ma, then ...
- This is not your fault.

02:17.436 --> 02:18.969
How could you possibly anticipate

02:19.004 --> 02:20.303
that someone would
lure Maura into a trap?

02:20.339 --> 02:21.605
You were just protecting

02:21.640 --> 02:23.473
the most vulnerable person
in your circle.

02:23.508 --> 02:24.908
- And Maura ...
- Is strong.

02:24.943 --> 02:26.676
She's smart.
She is capable.

02:26.712 --> 02:30.046
She will do her part. Now we
have to do our part, right?

02:30.082 --> 02:32.549
Detective Rizzoli.

02:32.584 --> 02:34.551
- Yeah?
- I think I found some blood,

02:34.586 --> 02:37.053
maybe some other biological material.

02:37.089 --> 02:40.290
It's okay. It's just a little
bit, which is a good thing, right?

02:40.325 --> 02:42.125
Fast track everything, including
that black stuff over there.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.460
[whispers] Yeah.

02:43.495 --> 02:46.296
[voice breaking] Yeah, that's great.
We ... We ... We got some blood

02:46.331 --> 02:49.032
and a phone number and a footprint.
That's not a lot to go on.

02:49.067 --> 02:52.702
Doesn't mean
we won't find her. Hmm?

02:52.738 --> 02:55.005
We'll find her.

03:24.469 --> 03:26.136
There's been a shift change
since it was placed,

03:26.171 --> 03:27.671
so all the people who were
working have gone home.

03:27.706 --> 03:30.640
We reached out and asked
everyone to come back in.

03:30.676 --> 03:32.175
Mm-hmm.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.044
- Jane.
- Huh?

03:34.079 --> 03:35.512
Did you hear what we said?

03:35.547 --> 03:39.049
Yeah. And if those people
aren't back here in 15 minutes,

03:39.084 --> 03:41.117
then send uniforms to go get 'em.

03:41.153 --> 03:43.586
You really think this is an inside job?

03:43.622 --> 03:47.372
I hope not, but based on what we
know, that's where we gotta start.

03:50.405 --> 03:54.107
- Jane, are you okay?
- Yeah.

03:54.142 --> 03:59.579
- 'Cause you've been up a long time.
- S... we all have. Uh...

03:59.614 --> 04:03.150
Okay, Lianne Sampson's murder
and Maura's abduction are

04:03.151 --> 04:06.686
related, so anything that
we need for either case ...

04:06.721 --> 04:08.488
uh, warrants, private security videos,

04:08.523 --> 04:09.789
- shoe leather ...
- I'll get it.

04:09.825 --> 04:11.391
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:11.426 --> 04:14.394
Oh, and, uh, we need to put a
trap and trace on Maura's cell

04:14.395 --> 04:17.363
phone and her home phone, just
in case the kidnappers call.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.500
Already done. And we also
rerouted your air card

04:20.535 --> 04:25.358
- so we can keep an eye on you.
- Okay.

04:28.777 --> 04:30.543
Chief wants a task force,
but because we can't rule out

04:30.579 --> 04:32.512
that someone from B.P.D. is involved,

04:32.547 --> 04:34.347
he's gonna give us 24 hours
before he puts it in motion.

04:34.416 --> 04:37.483
- We don't have 24 hours.
- This isn't a standard kidnapping.

04:37.519 --> 04:39.419
And just because we don't get
a demand for ransom in 12 hours,

04:39.454 --> 04:40.820
it doesn't mean they've
decided to kill her.

04:40.856 --> 04:42.388
No, that's true.
She could already be dead.

04:42.424 --> 04:45.425
How about we work more,
randomly theorize less?

04:45.460 --> 04:48.261

- What's this?
- Turkey sandwich, side of carrot,

05:13.421 --> 05:16.189
baked sweet potato chips,
and a brownie.

05:16.224 --> 05:19.826
- Homemade brownie.
- [whispers] Thank you, Ma.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.196
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey.

05:23.231 --> 05:26.499
Everyone from the previous
dispatch shift has been contacted

05:26.534 --> 05:27.867
and should be in the building
within a half an hour.

05:27.903 --> 05:32.338
- Okay, good.
- Tuna fish.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.808
- Thanks, Ma.
- Yeah.

05:35.844 --> 05:38.344
[sighs] How you doing?

05:38.380 --> 05:40.947
All I can do is
make sandwiches, so lousy.

05:43.485 --> 05:46.986

I worked so hard

05:47.022 --> 05:50.556
to deal with my feelings
about your job.

05:51.993 --> 05:53.993
I just didn't know I was
supposed to be dealing

05:54.029 --> 05:58.298

- What about the blood?

06:25.827 --> 06:28.962
[sighs] The D.N.A. tests are in
process, should be back any minute.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.898
- But the blood's 0-positive, so...
- It's not hers.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.599
No. [sighs]

06:33.635 --> 06:37.770
Possibly the perpetrator was
injured during the abduction.

06:37.806 --> 06:41.307
Well, it's not random. She bit
him or punched him in the nose,

06:41.343 --> 06:43.509
just something to leave us
a breadcrumb.

06:43.545 --> 06:45.979
You... do know that in the
fairy tale, the breadcrumbs

06:45.980 --> 06:48.414
lead to the witch's house,
which led the children...

06:48.450 --> 06:51.651
Oh. Which is neither here
nor there, is it?

06:51.686 --> 06:55.788
It's not a witch.
It's not a big, bad wolf.

06:55.824 --> 06:57.457
It's just some jackass
that we gotta get to

06:57.492 --> 07:01.761

- Right.

Hey, uh, D.N.A. results came back.
No match in our system,

08:20.831 --> 08:21.997
but we are we looking for
a white male,

08:22.032 --> 08:24.533
probably of
Middle European descent.

08:24.568 --> 08:26.835
- That's it?
- Yeah.

08:26.870 --> 08:29.471
[exhales deeply]
I know it's not very helpful.

08:29.506 --> 08:33.674
Well, it eliminates people, and
that's better than adding them, right?

08:33.711 --> 08:37.846
- I'll pass it along.
- All right.

08:39.582 --> 08:41.883
Look, I've been through
this dispatch log twice.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.552
No incoming calls at that time

08:43.587 --> 08:45.854
would've required a referral
to the M.E.'s office.

08:45.889 --> 08:47.723
Okay, but the call
that Dr. Isles received

08:47.758 --> 08:50.258
- did come from your department.
- I can't explain that.

08:50.294 --> 08:53.128
- You having problems with anybody
who works for you?  - No.

08:53.163 --> 08:54.730
Anybody leave sick last night?
[cell phone vibrates, beeps]

08:54.765 --> 08:55.997
Stan McQueen.

08:57.801 --> 08:59.901
- Is he a white male?
- Yes.

08:59.937 --> 09:01.703
McQueen's not our guy.

09:01.739 --> 09:03.205
He's been in a wheelchair since
before you joined the force.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.773
Some kind of a boating accident.

09:04.808 --> 09:08.143
Detectives, everyone in operations
has been thoroughly vetted.

09:08.178 --> 09:09.611
They wouldn't do something like this.

09:09.646 --> 09:12.164
Okay, well, someone called
the M.E.'s office, and they

09:12.165 --> 09:14.683
knew enough about our dispatch
process to fool Dr. Isles.

09:14.718 --> 09:17.252
So have you seen anyone unusual?

09:17.287 --> 09:21.632
Has anyone been nosin' around,
asking questions? Anything.

09:23.293 --> 09:25.026
Sergeant Miller?

09:25.062 --> 09:28.163
Last week, I got a call from
an eighth grade girl

09:28.198 --> 09:31.066
who said she was doing a report
on the 9-1-1 system.

09:31.101 --> 09:33.034
She asked about our process
and protocols.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.670
What, like how calls come in?
Or when we call the M.E.'s office?

09:35.706 --> 09:37.205
- Things like that?
- Yeah.

09:37.241 --> 09:39.574
Okay, we need to know exactly
when you got that call

09:39.610 --> 09:41.076
- so we can trace it.  - Of course.
I'll have to check the logs downstairs.

09:41.111 --> 09:45.547
Like now.
I'll meet you back in the squad room.

09:45.582 --> 09:47.082
All right.

[telephone rings in distance]

09:52.156 --> 09:53.722
What do you got, Holiday?

09:53.757 --> 09:55.690
Based on the time
that Sergeant Miller gave you,

09:55.726 --> 09:58.293
I tracked the call he received
to a burner phone.

09:58.328 --> 10:01.062
Turns out that same phone
pinged off a cell tower

10:01.098 --> 10:04.232
near Maura's abduction site,
at the time of her abduction.

10:04.268 --> 10:06.835
Then why did her caller I.D.
show an internal B.P.D. number?

10:06.870 --> 10:09.671
There are apps that will let you
spoof your caller I.D.

10:09.706 --> 10:11.774
It's illegal to use them
for criminal purposes, but as

10:11.775 --> 10:13.842
long as you're already involved
in a criminal activity...

10:13.877 --> 10:15.577
- Why sweat the small stuff?
- Exactly.

10:15.612 --> 10:17.813
Is it also easy to pretend
you're a 13-year-old girl?

10:17.848 --> 10:19.815
Or did our kidnapper get
a teenager involved?

10:19.850 --> 10:23.318
[beeps]

10:24.755 --> 10:27.255
[telephone rings]

10:27.291 --> 10:28.990
Go ahead.

10:29.026 --> 10:30.192
- Go ahead what?
- Young female voice: Go ahead what?

10:30.227 --> 10:32.093
[laughs]
[laughs]

10:32.129 --> 10:33.929
[chuckles]

10:33.964 --> 10:36.131
Maura's abduction was not
an inside job. [clicks button]

10:36.166 --> 10:39.000
No, and our fake teenage call
to dispatch came in last week,

10:39.036 --> 10:41.069
so the kidnapper had
time to plan things.

10:41.104 --> 10:43.238
Probably gonna make him
much harder to find.

10:43.273 --> 10:45.640
[telephone rings in distance]
I know.

10:53.817 --> 10:56.719
- Anything?
- The tarry substance that made

10:56.720 --> 10:59.354
the smudges at the crime scene,
that was from bleeding asphalt.

11:00.991 --> 11:03.024
Please tell me you have
something more than that,

11:03.060 --> 11:06.361
Because there's about 35,000
miles of road in Massachusetts.

11:06.396 --> 11:10.999
35,590, to be precise.

11:11.034 --> 11:14.769
But who's counting?
Yeah, I did find something else.

11:14.805 --> 11:16.271
There was a small paint chip in the tar,

11:16.306 --> 11:18.273
the top layer of which
was lead-based.

11:18.308 --> 11:21.376
- Lead paint was banned in 1975!
- Exactly.

11:21.411 --> 11:24.530
Now this particular
pigment was only purchased

11:24.531 --> 11:27.649
by municipalities between 1973 and 1977.

11:27.684 --> 11:30.685
When government buildings
were required to either

11:30.721 --> 11:33.755
paint over the lead paint
or remove it completely.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.124
- Mm.
- Well, so what?

11:36.159 --> 11:37.359
You think the abductor has got Maura

11:37.394 --> 11:39.227
in some abandoned
government building?

11:39.263 --> 11:43.832
Which narrows our locations
down from thousands to...

11:43.867 --> 11:46.134
several hundred? Maybe?

11:46.169 --> 11:48.303
- Yeah.
- I hope.

11:48.338 --> 11:50.205
Uh, did you get anything else
from the sample?

11:50.240 --> 11:51.706
Yeah, we're working on it.

11:51.742 --> 11:53.074
What about you?
Did you find anything?

11:53.110 --> 11:56.312
Um, just a list of people
that were in prison

11:56.313 --> 11:59.281
with Lianne Sampson
and paroled in the last year.

11:59.316 --> 12:01.349
I'm gonna go through 'em, see if
I can find any connection.

12:01.385 --> 12:03.785
Do you think Lianne Sampson
would be imprisoned

12:03.820 --> 12:06.054
with the kind of people
who would commit murder?

12:06.089 --> 12:07.289
Probably not.

12:07.324 --> 12:11.693
- Right, so that's a bit of a...
- Bit of a stretch, yeah.

12:11.728 --> 12:15.964
Look... I hope you don't
mind if I say, but...

12:15.999 --> 12:17.432
[inhales deeply]

12:17.467 --> 12:20.468
you look awful.

12:20.504 --> 12:24.839
- Thanks.
- No, really, you look like...

12:24.875 --> 12:26.374
I mean, when's the last time you slept?

12:26.410 --> 12:31.179
[sighs] I... don't know.
A-A day or two?

12:31.214 --> 12:32.714
Maybe you should have a nap.

12:32.749 --> 12:38.720
N.A.S.A. pilots who slept for 40 minutes
increased their alertness by 54%.

12:38.755 --> 12:41.823
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

12:41.858 --> 12:44.259
Well, you can take your fact
and shove it up your...

12:44.294 --> 12:46.428
[telephone rings]

13:01.845 --> 13:03.745
[sighs]

13:03.780 --> 13:06.881

13:06.917 --> 13:08.249
[exhales deeply]

13:19.930 --> 13:22.931

13:34.011 --> 13:37.012
[low humming sound in distance]

13:41.018 --> 13:45.487
[files thud]
[humming volume increases]

13:51.028 --> 13:55.997
[humming grows louder]

14:08.311 --> 14:12.347
<i>Don't worry, Jane.
I'll take good care of her.</i>

14:19.856 --> 14:22.190
[inhales sharply]

14:22.225 --> 14:27.028
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:27.064 --> 14:30.365
I came looking for you,
and I found you asleep.

14:32.202 --> 14:36.571
Yeah. Um...
I was looking at lists.

14:36.606 --> 14:39.240
I was, uh,
I was looking for, um...

14:39.276 --> 14:41.976
It's okay to take
a short nap, Janie.

14:42.012 --> 14:45.513
<i>You've been up for a long time.</i>

14:45.549 --> 14:47.982
[exhales deeply]

14:48.018 --> 14:50.518
[sighs deeply]

14:50.554 --> 14:52.353
You okay?

14:55.559 --> 15:00.128
No. I'm not.

15:04.549 --> 15:06.115
[music]

15:06.150 --> 15:09.185
- What is all this?
- Purchase orders and contracts

15:09.220 --> 15:12.188
for all the abandoned government
buildings in Massachusetts.

15:12.223 --> 15:15.191
Turns out that the paint chip
that Kent found

15:15.226 --> 15:16.659
was five different layers of paint.

15:16.694 --> 15:19.195
So we have to look through
all of this stuff and...

15:19.230 --> 15:21.397
Figure out which building
was painted in this order.

15:21.432 --> 15:23.165
That's gonna take forever.

15:23.201 --> 15:25.134
No, it's not. Now that we know
it's not an inside job,

15:25.169 --> 15:28.170
we're a task force.
We have all the assets we need.

15:28.206 --> 15:29.739
Detective Rizzoli's in charge.

15:29.774 --> 15:31.140
- Hey.
- Good to meet you.

15:31.175 --> 15:32.742
- Talk to him.
- Okay.

15:32.777 --> 15:35.695
- Wait. Where you goin'?
- Gotta deliver warrants

15:35.696 --> 15:38.614
to search the databases of all
the cell phone towers in Boston.

15:38.649 --> 15:40.750
Oh.
[telephone ringing in distance]

15:40.785 --> 15:42.451
All right, so we have to
figure out

15:42.487 --> 15:44.453
which one of these buildings
was painted in this order.

15:44.489 --> 15:46.455
- Man: All right.
- What'd you find?

15:46.491 --> 15:48.090
I pulled the records
for all the cell phones

15:48.126 --> 15:50.359
that pinged off the tower
near Maura's abduction,

15:50.395 --> 15:52.495
just in case our perpetrator
was carrying his own phone.

15:52.530 --> 15:55.197
- That was good thinking.
- I got 25 names,

15:55.233 --> 15:58.167
one more interesting than the rest.
Joe Harris. [computer beeps]

15:58.202 --> 16:01.604
Psychiatrist from M.C.I. Framingham's
women's prison. [computer beeps]

16:01.639 --> 16:03.339
He treated Lianne.

16:03.374 --> 16:05.508
<i>Frankie interviewed him
during the murder investigation.</i>

16:05.543 --> 16:08.711
- Where is his phone now?
- Pinging off a tower near the prison.

16:08.746 --> 16:10.346
Call the warden.
Tell her to find him,

16:10.381 --> 16:12.448
- hold on to him till I get there.
- Already done.

16:12.483 --> 16:13.783
And send a full background to my phone.

16:13.818 --> 16:17.319
And... [computer beeps]
done.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.425

[beep]

18:43.334 --> 18:48.904
Hope?
Thanks for calling me back.

18:48.940 --> 18:52.397
I, uh...
I hate to have to tell you this

18:52.398 --> 18:54.910
over the phone,
but something's happened,

18:54.946 --> 18:59.682
and I don't want you to hear it
on the news.

18:59.717 --> 19:05.765
Yeah, yes. Yes, it's ...
it's Maura. She's been abducted.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.822
[exhales]

19:06.857 --> 19:09.959
We searched the prison and all
the outlying areas. He's not here.

19:09.994 --> 19:12.861
I have someone pulling security
video to see what time he left.

19:12.897 --> 19:14.563
I'll let you know
as soon as we find out.

19:14.599 --> 19:15.864
How long has he been here?

19:15.900 --> 19:19.435
Two years.
Came from Lauson prison upstate.

19:19.470 --> 19:23.072
- What do you think of him?
- [sighs] It's hard to get a good therapist here.

19:23.107 --> 19:25.441
They ... they make so much
money in private practice.

19:25.476 --> 19:29.378
But Harris was solid.
The women seemed to respect him.

19:29.413 --> 19:31.447
<i>He was compassionate,
not a pushover.</i>

19:31.482 --> 19:33.515
I can't imagine he'd have
anything to do with this.

19:33.551 --> 19:34.783
We'll see. Could be
his phone being nearby

19:34.819 --> 19:37.886
is just a coincidence.
I don't have a search warrant,

19:37.922 --> 19:40.856
- so I can't look in there without your permission.
- Of course.

19:40.891 --> 19:44.460
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

20:08.953 --> 20:10.552
[cell phone beeps]

20:10.588 --> 20:13.889
Korsak, Harris is definitely
our guy. Hang on.

20:13.924 --> 20:16.025
I need everything that
you have on him right now.

20:16.060 --> 20:17.626
We gotta find this guy.

20:17.662 --> 20:19.895

20:31.942 --> 20:36.545
It's a little cold in here.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.047
I'm gonna bring you a blanket.

20:39.684 --> 20:42.651
Okay?
[unlocks handcuffs]

20:42.687 --> 20:44.787
[pipe rattles]
Let's get you up.

20:44.822 --> 20:46.655
[strained voice] Let get you up.
[grunts]

20:46.691 --> 20:48.123
Okay, now...

20:48.159 --> 20:50.159
If it's money you want,
I can get you money.

20:50.194 --> 20:52.928
Come on. If I wanted your money,
I'd already have it, right?

20:52.963 --> 20:54.630
[handcuffs click]

20:54.665 --> 20:56.398
[breathing heavily]

20:56.434 --> 20:59.935
Then what is this about?
What do you want?

20:59.970 --> 21:03.806
First in your class in medical school.
[knife clicks]

21:03.841 --> 21:05.441
First medical examiner

21:05.476 --> 21:07.543
to head the New England
medical organization.

21:07.578 --> 21:10.079
Peer reviewer
for five medical journals.

21:10.114 --> 21:11.747
You really expect me to believe

21:11.782 --> 21:14.983
- you don't know what this is about?
- Hmm?

21:15.019 --> 21:16.618
Aah!
[snip]

21:16.654 --> 21:19.655
[breathing heavily]

21:22.593 --> 21:24.660
It's a good look for ya.

21:24.695 --> 21:27.429
I don't know what this is about.

21:27.465 --> 21:29.565
I know you studied
psychology in school.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.868
Profile me. Peer to peer.
What do you think?

21:32.903 --> 21:35.838
Dissociative personality
disorder with aberrant

21:35.839 --> 21:38.774
functional connectivity in
the default mode network?

21:40.878 --> 21:44.046
- Aah!
- That's for biting me.

21:44.081 --> 21:46.849
[breathing heavily]

21:46.884 --> 21:49.852
Okay, say "cheese."

21:49.887 --> 21:53.689
[camera shutter clicking]
I... love...

21:53.724 --> 21:55.423
Isles.

21:55.458 --> 21:58.861
[camera shutter clicking]

22:01.958 --> 22:04.142
I've already put in a
request with Joe Harris'

22:04.143 --> 22:06.327
cell phone company for
his home locator records

22:06.362 --> 22:07.895
so we can track
his recent movements.

22:07.931 --> 22:09.664
Okay, let me know if that's
not happening fast enough.

22:09.699 --> 22:11.299
Once I get it, I'll start
cross-referencing his movements

22:11.334 --> 22:12.733
with the list of abandoned
government buildings

22:12.769 --> 22:14.368
we got from the paint chip.

22:14.544 --> 22:16.510
A lot of those are gonna be
in urban areas...

22:16.546 --> 22:18.312
[keys clatter] places that he'd
drive by on his normal commute.

22:18.348 --> 22:19.780
I know, but I'm hoping
all this digging

22:19.816 --> 22:22.616
will help us narrow it down.

22:22.652 --> 22:24.752
Also sent his picture
to all law enforcement agencies

22:24.787 --> 22:28.085
on the eastern seaboard,
put a B.O.L.O. out on his car.

22:28.370 --> 22:30.257
and Korsak has assigned uniforms
to sit on his apartment,

22:30.292 --> 22:33.227
his parents' house, and the bar
he likes on the South Side.

22:33.512 --> 22:36.313
Have you found any evidence that
this guy and I know each other?

22:36.598 --> 22:38.865
I suppose you could've met
at a restaurant.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.334
Professionally,
I-I haven't found anything.

22:41.370 --> 22:42.836
Maybe at the prison?

22:42.871 --> 22:45.338
Is that list of prisoners
that he's seen come in yet?

22:45.374 --> 22:47.741
They called 30 minutes ago, said
it would be ready in an hour.

22:47.776 --> 22:51.010
- [sighs] Thank you.
- For what, doing my job?

22:51.046 --> 22:53.380
Yeah. And for...

22:53.415 --> 22:54.748
making sure I don't let
anything slip through the cracks.

22:54.783 --> 22:57.117
- I'm a little...
- Frayed?

22:57.152 --> 22:58.685
Mm-hmm.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.353
- You really should get some sleep.
- I know.

23:00.389 --> 23:03.089
You have no idea why this guy
would go after you?

23:03.125 --> 23:05.992
No... which I think would make
sleeping difficult,

23:06.027 --> 23:08.895
so I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want anything?

23:08.930 --> 23:10.966
No.
[telephone rings in distance]

23:12.901 --> 23:16.636
[beeping] You're very photogenic,
which is unfortunate

23:16.671 --> 23:18.872
because I need you to play
a different part right now,

23:18.907 --> 23:24.110
- not audition for "Cats."
- "Cats" closed a long time ago.

23:24.146 --> 23:26.613
I never paid much attention to Broadway.

23:26.648 --> 23:28.715
I really don't wanna hit you again.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.951
It seems unsporting,
you being tied up and all.

23:33.422 --> 23:35.655
Then tell me what part
I'm supposed to be playing.

23:35.690 --> 23:40.927
Oh. Here we go. Perfect.
Little fear, some pleading,

23:40.962 --> 23:46.065
just a hint of hope that
someone might actually save you.

23:46.101 --> 23:49.936
[beeping] Jane Rizzoli
got under your skin.

23:49.971 --> 23:53.490
- No, she didn't.
- You think that picture

23:53.491 --> 23:56.810
with a little blood on my lip
is gonna bother her.

23:56.845 --> 23:58.511
That's the plan.
[zips up bag]

23:58.547 --> 24:01.080
[chuckles]

24:01.116 --> 24:02.816
I-If you really wanted
to get a rise out of her,

24:02.851 --> 24:05.885
why didn't you kidnap
one of her sisters?

24:05.921 --> 24:09.489
Because stealing you from right
under her nose was more fun.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.693
Don't worry.
It'll all be over soon.

24:13.728 --> 24:15.462
You'll play the part
of innocent victim.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.431
Jane Rizzoli can play
the ineffectual detective

24:18.467 --> 24:20.633
as she watches you die.

24:25.474 --> 24:28.608
I-I-I know I'm not always
the easiest person to be around.

24:28.643 --> 24:30.076
It's the stress of the job.

24:30.111 --> 24:32.979
I mean, it's just ...
it's the focus I gotta give it.

24:33.014 --> 24:36.049
I think people understand that.
I mean, my mom, yeah.

24:36.084 --> 24:38.718
You know, she gives me
a hard time sometimes,

24:38.753 --> 24:41.654
but that's... it's just 'cause
she worries about me.

24:41.690 --> 24:45.725
Worries about my brother.
Hell, I worry about my brother.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.996
He made a choice, right...
to carry a badge?

24:50.031 --> 24:53.099
Worry's just part of it.
[sighs]

24:53.134 --> 24:56.102
You know, I just ... I never
thought that ... that...

24:56.137 --> 24:59.205
that I was supposed to worry
about them, you know?

24:59.241 --> 25:00.224
I never dreamed that somebody

25:00.225 --> 25:04.477
was gonna try to hurt me
by hurting them. [sighs]

25:04.513 --> 25:06.613
You understand what
I'm saying, Eduardo?

25:06.648 --> 25:11.117
<i>Lo siento, detective.
No hablo Inglés.</i>

25:11.152 --> 25:13.019
<i>- I know.
- Con permiso?</i>

25:13.054 --> 25:15.722
<i>- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
- Gracias.</i>

25:16.413 --> 25:19.893

[telephone ringing in distance]

25:22.664 --> 25:24.197
[indistinct conversations]

25:24.232 --> 25:26.266
- Any updates?
- Yeah, I, uh, I sent that paint chip

25:26.301 --> 25:27.967
off to the lab at M.I.T.

25:28.003 --> 25:29.869
They have a machine that does
raman spectroscopy.

25:29.905 --> 25:32.972
- Still waiting on the results.
- Okay, great.

25:33.008 --> 25:34.874
[telephone rings in distance,
indistinct conversations]

25:34.910 --> 25:37.143
Did you need something else?

25:37.178 --> 25:40.046
I guess I was just wondering if
there's anything I can do to help.

25:40.081 --> 25:42.982
I'm... feeling a little bit impotent.

25:43.018 --> 25:46.586
We've eliminated 90 buildings so far

25:46.621 --> 25:49.022
based on the 5-layer criteria
that you gave us.

25:49.057 --> 25:50.723
We have a lot of records
to go through still,

25:50.759 --> 25:52.792
- trying to narrow the list.
- I-I can help with that.

25:52.827 --> 25:54.894
This is a public works
building in Newton.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.563
Jane, do you have a copy
of Kent's paint analysis

25:56.598 --> 25:57.797
for him to use as reference?

25:57.832 --> 26:00.199
No need.
I have a photographic memory.

26:00.235 --> 26:02.268
[chair scrapes floor]

26:02.304 --> 26:04.170
You know, this reminds me
of a class I did in Edinburgh.

26:04.205 --> 26:06.072
- It was all about archaeology ...
- We work in silence.

26:06.107 --> 26:07.807
[telephone rings in distance]

26:07.842 --> 26:09.943
Yeah, okey-doke.
We work in silence.

26:09.978 --> 26:11.311
That's not silence.

26:11.346 --> 26:14.180
We've been digging
into Joe Harris' cell phone.

26:14.215 --> 26:16.683
Maybe he doesn't carry it all the time,

26:16.718 --> 26:18.969
<i>but if he has been, it doesn't
seem like he's gone any further</i>

26:18.970 --> 26:20.954
out of Boston than the prison
over the last two weeks.

26:20.989 --> 26:24.157
That doesn't fit with how
meticulously planned this all is.

26:24.192 --> 26:25.758
But the phone has circled
the area... [tablet beeps]

26:25.794 --> 26:28.661
of a former mental hospital ...
the Arkush Asylum.

26:28.697 --> 26:30.063
<i>Korsak: We didn't have records
for that building.</i>

26:30.098 --> 26:31.931
<i>Frankie: Yeah, Harris doesn't
live in the area.</i>

26:31.967 --> 26:33.600
No one from his list
of contacts does either.

26:33.635 --> 26:36.603
And he hasn't made a single credit
card purchase anywhere near there.

26:36.638 --> 26:40.673
- He has no reason to be there?
- Not any that we can find.

26:40.709 --> 26:42.976
Scramble a tactical team.
Radio silence. [chair clatters]

26:43.011 --> 26:44.577
I don't want him to hurt Maura
if he hears us coming.

26:44.613 --> 26:46.613
- You stay.
- Nina: Got it.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.914
[sighs]

26:47.949 --> 26:50.850
[music]

26:50.885 --> 26:53.744
I don't know.
I ... Yes.

26:53.779 --> 26:58.257
I-I-I probably had
my phone on me. I...

26:58.293 --> 27:02.028
No. No, I-I definitely left it
in my desk

27:02.063 --> 27:04.697
when I came back from the prison.

27:04.733 --> 27:07.200
Are you sure they know
I'm involved?

27:09.838 --> 27:14.774
No. I would never tell them
about you.

27:18.279 --> 27:22.248
Yes.
That's a good idea.

27:22.283 --> 27:25.918
The tunnel.
Yes.

27:25.954 --> 27:29.756
And ... And I-I need you
to know that I'm sorry.

27:29.791 --> 27:32.892
Okay? I'm ... I'm ...
I'm really, really sorry.

27:32.927 --> 27:36.963
But I will fix it. There's ...
They will never find us.

27:36.998 --> 27:38.698
[handcuffs scrape]

27:40.769 --> 27:45.238
Yes, I'll ... I'll destroy it
immediately, I promise.

27:48.343 --> 27:51.144
I know. You, too.

27:53.682 --> 27:54.881
[cell phone cracks]

27:54.916 --> 27:57.684
[inhales sharply]

27:57.719 --> 27:59.285
[stomping]

28:04.926 --> 28:07.727
[panting] Well, you're wrong
about your friend.

28:07.762 --> 28:10.930
Apparently, she cares
a great deal that I have you.

28:15.203 --> 28:16.669
You can end this.

28:16.705 --> 28:19.839
Just leave me here
and make a run for it.

28:19.874 --> 28:22.208
I don't like to leave things
unfinished.

28:22.243 --> 28:23.676
You're a therapist.

28:23.712 --> 28:27.680
Oh, did I give that away with
"aberrant functional connectivity"?

28:27.716 --> 28:29.867
How many times have you told
your patients that just because

28:29.868 --> 28:32.018
they make one mistake doesn't
mean they have to make two?

28:32.053 --> 28:33.886
Hundreds of times, darling.

28:33.922 --> 28:36.889
But I talk to prisoners.
They rarely listen.

28:36.925 --> 28:39.325
- And when they do?
- Small victories.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.828
So this can be another small victory.

28:41.863 --> 28:43.396
Whoever that was on the phone

28:43.431 --> 28:46.132
is not gonna take responsibility
for this. You are.

28:46.167 --> 28:48.334
Yes, you're very persuasive, Dr. Isles.

28:48.369 --> 28:50.970
I'm sure that works for you
a lot of the time.

28:51.005 --> 28:53.106
- No...
- Now relax, Doc.

28:53.141 --> 28:56.142
[muffled grunting]

29:00.081 --> 29:02.515
[whispers] Shh.

29:04.486 --> 29:05.885
[muffled grunt]

30:24.165 --> 30:26.199
<i>Jane: Clear.</i>

30:26.234 --> 30:30.336
This is the last room on this floor.
I'm headed down a level.

30:30.371 --> 30:33.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is that?

30:33.041 --> 30:34.874
You smell that?

30:36.477 --> 30:38.177
[Korsak sniffs]

30:38.213 --> 30:39.846
[sniffs] What is it?

30:39.881 --> 30:41.881
That's that ... that's that
perfume that Maura wears.

30:41.916 --> 30:44.584
- Eau de... Something.
- She was here.

30:44.619 --> 30:46.786
Yeah.

30:50.073 --> 30:52.541
Until reinforcements get
here, let's stick to the major

30:52.542 --> 30:55.009
thoroughfares except for this
2-lane road that leads out of here.

30:55.045 --> 30:57.278
And we haven't found his car yet.
Remind the guys

30:57.313 --> 30:59.013
- to keep their eyes open for you.
- Will do.

30:59.249 --> 31:00.615
We searched the whole building.
There's no sign of them.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.116
- The hell made him leave?
- I don't know.

31:02.351 --> 31:03.751
And I can't figure out
his endgame either.

31:03.786 --> 31:06.520
You think he would've made contact,
leave us some kind of message.

31:06.556 --> 31:07.922
Well, clearly he's got
some kind of plan.

31:07.957 --> 31:09.690
He's just not ready
to put into motion yet.

31:09.725 --> 31:11.992
Korsak, is it possible
that he knew we were coming,

31:12.028 --> 31:13.794
and that's why he moved her?

31:13.830 --> 31:15.930
So still an inside job,
just not the way we thought?

31:15.965 --> 31:17.665
Maybe, yeah.
Maybe somebody at the prison.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.300
That seems more likely.

31:19.335 --> 31:23.604
Looks like he had her chained
near the radiator,

31:23.639 --> 31:26.607
- and then moved her to the chair.
- Yeah.

31:30.815 --> 31:32.570
Korsak.

31:32.982 --> 31:37.685
T... U... N... N...
Tunnel.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.454
I'll try to catch ward. I'll
have dispatch put roadblocks up

31:40.490 --> 31:43.278
in front of the tunnels.
[cell phone beeps]

31:53.369 --> 31:56.537
[slashes]
Uhh! Uhh!

32:08.117 --> 32:10.351
They found his car
in an indoor parking lot

32:10.386 --> 32:11.752
about 3 miles from the Asylum.

32:11.787 --> 32:13.420
Yeah, he must've parked it
and walked back

32:13.456 --> 32:14.989
so we wouldn't see it here.

32:15.024 --> 32:16.490
They're sending video
from the parking lot.

32:16.526 --> 32:18.993
I'll go through all the cars
exiting, see if I can find him.

32:19.028 --> 32:20.461
- Thanks, Mrs. Rizzoli.
- Mm.

32:20.496 --> 32:22.997
- Hey, Ma.
- Hi, Jane. How are you?

32:23.032 --> 32:26.133
Hey, I couldn't find anyone
to talk to.

32:26.169 --> 32:27.868
<i>- Jane: About what?
- Oh, hi.</i>

32:27.904 --> 32:29.537
About what?!

32:29.572 --> 32:31.705
Eh, the test results that
came back from M.I.T.

32:31.741 --> 32:34.375
The paint was never exposed
to any form of sunlight.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.143
<i>The oxidation of the layers
were such</i>

32:36.179 --> 32:38.612
that it was most likely kept
in a cold environment.

32:38.648 --> 32:40.014
Well, that would make sense.

32:40.049 --> 32:41.415
Maura was trying to tell us
about a tunnel.

32:41.450 --> 32:44.552
<i>But not a tunnel that was
exposed to temperature variations.</i>

32:44.587 --> 32:46.787
Our paint chip had never been
exposed to high temperatures.

32:46.972 --> 32:48.839
Which means car tunnels are out.

32:48.874 --> 32:50.874
Those are like ovens in the summer.

32:50.910 --> 32:53.777
Yeah, we searched the entire Asylum.
There aren't any tunnels here.

32:53.813 --> 32:55.779
That's because according
to the blueprints,

32:55.815 --> 32:57.147
Arkush doesn't have tunnels.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.217
Sure, it does.
I remember when Jane was little,

33:00.252 --> 33:03.554
there was some kind
of accident, a cave-in,

33:03.589 --> 33:05.089
and a couple of the patients died.

33:05.124 --> 33:07.991
All right, we'll search again.
Holiday,

33:08.027 --> 33:10.828
send me something helpful, all right?
[cell phone beeps]

33:10.863 --> 33:12.896
These are the only blueprints I have.

33:12.932 --> 33:17.701
- I-I don't have any other information.
- Don't let that stop you.

33:18.804 --> 33:22.072
- What can I do?
- Call the public library.

33:22.108 --> 33:24.675
Uh, get a librarian to help
with newspaper archives.

33:24.710 --> 33:27.211
I'm gonna figure out the date of this
tunnel collapse. [typing on keyboard]

33:27.246 --> 33:29.313
[music]

33:42.027 --> 33:45.262
Okay, so all the entrances are sealed.

33:45.297 --> 33:47.030
But according to this picture,

33:47.066 --> 33:51.133
<i>there's an entrance somewhere
near two utility pipes.</i>

33:52.371 --> 33:53.871
All right.

33:56.809 --> 33:58.675
[flashlight clicks]

34:10.222 --> 34:12.322
Korsak: Hey, I got it this way.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.664
[lowered voice] Do it.

34:20.699 --> 34:22.666
[door rattles]

34:22.701 --> 34:23.900
[unholsters gun]

34:42.822 --> 34:44.888
I got it.
[static hisses]

34:52.297 --> 34:54.665
So he used the shelving
to hide the entrance.

34:54.699 --> 34:55.933
This way.

34:55.967 --> 34:57.935
- [sighs] Ready?
- Yeah.

[door creaks]

35:20.493 --> 35:22.960
Okay.
[flashlight clicks]

35:22.995 --> 35:25.829
According to Nina, there are
two sets of tunnels, yeah...

35:25.865 --> 35:27.831
each leading to exits
in other buildings.

35:27.867 --> 35:30.791
The southernmost tunnel
is the one that collapsed.

35:32.838 --> 35:34.705
Why don't you guys go together?
I'll take the southern tunnel.

35:34.740 --> 35:37.975
- Wait, Frankie...
- Janie, I got it.

35:38.010 --> 35:41.150
- Be careful, detective.
- You, too.

- [whimpers] Oh, God. Jane.
- [whispers] Are you all right?

[panting]
The blood, it isn't mine.

37:19.035 --> 37:20.267
[whispers]
Do you know where he is?

37:20.303 --> 37:23.704
[clatter]
No. No, I-I just ... I r-ran.

37:23.739 --> 37:25.239
[breathing heavily]
I was hiding. I couldn't...

37:25.274 --> 37:27.007
[whispers] couldn't figure out
how to get out of here.

37:27.043 --> 37:29.276
[gunshots in distance]

37:29.312 --> 37:31.011
You go.
I'll take her out of here.

37:31.047 --> 37:33.848
Jane, be careful.
He's not working alone.

37:33.883 --> 37:35.082
- Okay.
- Can you walk?

37:35.117 --> 37:38.986
- [whispers] Yeah.
- Korsak: You're okay. You're okay.

37:56.339 --> 37:57.838
[whispers] Frankie!

38:00.343 --> 38:04.311
- Are you all right?
- [strained voice] No, I'm ... I'm fine.

38:04.347 --> 38:06.046
I fired off a shot.

38:06.082 --> 38:08.782
He shot back and hit the wall,
and this stuff fell on me.

38:08.818 --> 38:11.018
And I...
knocked my head a bit.

38:11.053 --> 38:13.220
[gunshot in distance]
Yeah, he went off to the right.

38:13.256 --> 38:14.688
I think I heard him go up
some stairs.

38:14.724 --> 38:16.657
- [whispers] Okay.
- I-I-I'm fine. Go!

38:16.692 --> 38:18.792

38:49.759 --> 38:52.126
[panting]

38:56.098 --> 38:57.731
[metal rattles]

39:01.137 --> 39:04.177
West annex roof, fire escape!
[static hisses]

39:04.322 --> 39:06.632
[gunshots]

39:06.633 --> 39:08.943
[gunshot]
Uhh!

39:12.748 --> 39:14.315
Drop it!
[gunshot]

39:14.350 --> 39:17.284
Aah! Uhh!

39:19.155 --> 39:21.522
Call E.M.T.s now!

39:22.959 --> 39:24.391
Don't you move!

39:24.427 --> 39:25.826
[wheezes]
[panting]

39:25.861 --> 39:27.728
Who are you working for, Harris?

39:27.763 --> 39:29.363
[wheezing]

39:29.398 --> 39:30.931
Who are you working for?!

39:30.967 --> 39:34.234
[continues wheezing]

39:34.270 --> 39:36.337
[voice breaks]
You don't even know me.

39:36.372 --> 39:38.272
[continues wheezing]

39:38.307 --> 39:41.408
[whispers] Why me?

39:41.444 --> 39:44.345
[panting]

39:44.380 --> 39:45.913
[normal voice] Why me?

39:47.550 --> 39:51.352
W...

39:51.387 --> 39:54.865
Why not?
[inhales sharply]

39:55.324 --> 39:57.856
[exhales deeply]

40:07.378 --> 40:10.250
[radio chatter]

40:10.932 --> 40:13.099
Hang on.
[siren wailing in distance]

40:13.151 --> 40:16.069
Jane.
Are you all right?

40:16.104 --> 40:17.770
How is she?

40:17.822 --> 40:19.655
Surface abrasions.
Single facial hematoma.

40:19.691 --> 40:21.240
- Okay.
- What she said,

40:21.276 --> 40:23.776
but we're taking her to General
for a full work-up.

40:23.778 --> 40:25.161
[whispers] Okay.

40:25.196 --> 40:26.746
[normal voice] Did he hurt you?

40:26.781 --> 40:30.666
[whispers]
He just wanted to scare me.

40:30.702 --> 40:32.702
[voice breaks] Well, he ...
well, he's dead, okay?

40:32.754 --> 40:34.287
You don't have to worry
about him anymore.

40:34.339 --> 40:39.125
I heard him on the phone.
He wasn't working alone.

40:39.177 --> 40:42.795
- This isn't over.
- It's over for now.

40:42.847 --> 40:46.799
- What did he want?
- [sighs] Doesn't matter, okay?

40:46.851 --> 40:49.302
[voice breaking] He's
dead, and you're safe. Okay?

40:49.304 --> 40:50.970
[sniffles]

40:50.972 --> 40:52.772
All right, um, I'll ... I'll come
straight to the hospital

40:52.807 --> 40:56.642
- as soon as I wrap up here.
- [voice breaks] Okay.

40:56.694 --> 40:58.644
Be careful.

40:58.696 --> 41:00.813
We need uniforms on ...
outside of her room 24/7.

41:00.865 --> 41:02.615
It's already taken care of.
[sighs deeply]

41:02.650 --> 41:05.618
- Did Harris say anything?
- No.

41:05.653 --> 41:07.120
So we don't know much more
than we knew yesterday?

41:07.155 --> 41:10.098
No. [sighs]
Just that somebody out there

41:10.099 --> 41:12.658
is really pissed off at me.
[vehicle doors close]

41:12.660 --> 41:17.130
I wish that narrowed it down
a little more than it does. [chuckles]

41:17.165 --> 41:20.532
I'm sorry. I'm an asshole.
[laughs]

41:20.888 --> 41:24.041
- Hey, you wanna drive so you can feel in charge?
- No! [laughs]

41:24.417 --> 41:30.300
- Really?!
- You're okay. You're okay.
