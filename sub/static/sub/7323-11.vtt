00:02.133 --> 00:03.774
(Meredith) TO A DEGREE,

00:03.774 --> 00:05.576
MEDICINE IS A SCIENCE.

00:05.576 --> 00:07.578
YOU SPENT SIX HOURS
ON A BOAT.
YES.

00:07.578 --> 00:09.580
AND YOU TALKED ABOUT FISHING.
YES.

00:09.580 --> 00:11.582
FOR SIX HOURS?
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

00:11.582 --> 00:14.485
DEREK.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

00:14.485 --> 00:16.587
WE WENT FISHING.
WE TALKED ABOUT FISHING.

00:16.587 --> 00:18.549
I WANT THE WHOLE STORY.
IT IS THE WHOLE STORY.

00:18.549 --> 00:21.392
"SHE CAUGHT A FISH AND CRIED"
IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY.

00:21.392 --> 00:25.196
EXCEPT IT IS THE STORY.
IT IS IN FACT THE ENTIRE STORY.

00:25.196 --> 00:26.357
(sighs)

00:26.357 --> 00:27.658
(sighs)

00:27.658 --> 00:30.661
I'M OVULATING.
UGH.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.604
BUT I WOULD ARGUE
THAT IT'S ALSO AN ART.

00:33.604 --> 00:36.667
I MEAN, YOU STOLE MY BEST
FRIEND, AND IT'S NOT OKAY.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.669
IT'S NOT OKAY
FOR THE TWO OF YOU

00:38.669 --> 00:42.213
TO HANG OUT
LIKE I DON'T EXIST.
I AM NOT HANGING OUT.
I AM TRYING TO HELP HER.

00:42.213 --> 00:45.246
BY HANGING OUT WITH HER.
(groans) WE GONNA DO THIS
OR NOT?

00:45.246 --> 00:48.149
I'M TOO MAD
TO EVEN LOOK AT YOU.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.151
WELL, THEN ROLL OVER.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.353
FINE.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.585
(laughs)

00:54.585 --> 00:58.629

AS SCIENCE ONLY?

00:58.629 --> 01:01.061
YOU DON'T WANT THEM
BY YOUR SIDE

01:01.061 --> 01:02.533
WHEN YOUR BLEEDING WON'T STOP

01:02.533 --> 01:04.535
OR WHEN YOUR CHILD
IS SCREAMING IN PAIN.

01:04.535 --> 01:06.237
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.

01:06.237 --> 01:09.240

TO WASTE DOWN THERE.
WHAT? WHAT?

08:56.967 --> 08:59.570

THE FEMUR IS SHATTERED.
TORRES CAN FIX THAT.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.912
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
HER LIFE THAN HER LEG.

09:01.912 --> 09:04.915
AND I'M SURE HER PARENTS
WILL BE, TOO.
LOOK, THIS KID IS 15.
YOU CAN SAVE THIS LEG.

09:04.915 --> 09:07.918
YOU CAN'T JUST CUT IT OFF.
WHAT I CAN'T DO IS TO SPEND
ANY MORE TIME ARGUING WITH YOU.

09:07.918 --> 09:09.750
WOULD YOU
MAINTAIN PRESSURE THERE?

09:09.750 --> 09:12.753
PREP THE DAMN LEG, KAREV.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.756
(beeping continues)

09:15.756 --> 09:18.288
(suction gurgling)

09:18.288 --> 09:20.961
FREAKIN' DO SOMETHING!

09:20.961 --> 09:23.563
(beeping continues)

09:25.195 --> 09:27.297
INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE'S
GETTING HIGHER.

09:27.297 --> 09:29.640
ARE WE DOING A CRANIECTOMY
OR A CRANIOTOMY?

09:29.640 --> 09:31.942
CRANIECTOMY IS OUR BEST BET.

09:31.942 --> 09:34.144
DR. SHEPHERD.

09:34.144 --> 09:36.576
YES.
THE PROFESSOR'S WIFE
JUST ARRIVED.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.609
CAN SOMEONE SPEAK TO HER?
YEAH.

09:38.609 --> 09:41.111
I'LL GO. I'LL BE QUICK.

09:41.111 --> 09:43.213
(turns water on)

09:43.213 --> 09:46.016
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
suction gurgling)

09:46.016 --> 09:48.358
YOU PAGED ME?

09:48.358 --> 09:49.890
YANG?

09:49.890 --> 09:52.763
SHE WAS AT THE SCENE.
OH, I WAS AT THE SCENE.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.825
HE'S GOT A TEAR
ON THE RIGHT VENTRICLE.

09:54.825 --> 09:57.297
AND THERE COULD BE TORRENTIAL
BLEEDING ONCE WE GET IN,

09:57.297 --> 10:00.130
SO I JUST, UH, JUST WANTED
A LITTLE BACKUP,

10:00.130 --> 10:03.103
JUST A LITTLE EXTRA BACKUP.
SHE'S NOT SURE
IF I CAN HANDLE IT.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.707
I'M READY. I'M IN. I'LL GO--
I'LL GO SCRUB.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET
THIS BOY ON BYPASS.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.779
(whirring)

10:08.779 --> 10:11.782
(indistinct conversations)

10:11.782 --> 10:14.785
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

10:14.785 --> 10:16.747
(indistinct conversations
continue)

10:16.747 --> 10:18.348
THERE?

10:18.348 --> 10:20.050
MRS. STURGEON.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.822
YES, HI.
HI.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.696
ARE YOU JOHN'S DOCTOR?
IS HE OKAY?
HE FELL FROM
A FOURTH-STORY WINDOW

10:25.696 --> 10:27.097
AND LANDED ON HIS HEAD,

10:27.097 --> 10:30.630
SO WE'RE TAKING HIM
TO SURGERY RIGHT NOW.
WAIT, WAIT. SURGERY?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.863
WE WILL BE REMOVING
THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS SKULL

10:32.863 --> 10:34.865
TO GIVE HIS BRAIN
ROOM TO SWELL.

10:34.865 --> 10:36.867
OKAY,
I-I WANT TO COME WITH YOU.

10:36.867 --> 10:38.869
I-I W--I W--I NEED
TO COME WITH YOU...

10:38.869 --> 10:40.871
(voice breaking) BECAUSE JOHN
DOESN'T LIKE HOSPITALS.

10:40.871 --> 10:42.873
YOU CAN'T COME INTO THE O.R.
NO, NO, NO.

10:42.873 --> 10:45.415
SEE, JOHN IS AFRAID
OF DOCTORS, OKAY?

10:45.415 --> 10:49.279
(crying) SO I HAVE TO BE WITH
HIM. PLEASE LET ME BE WITH HIM.

10:49.279 --> 10:50.781
MRS. STURGEON, I'M SO SORRY,

10:50.781 --> 10:52.783
BUT YOU CAN'T
COME IN TO THE O.R.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.786
I WILL COME OUT AND UPDATE YOU
EVERY CHANCE I GET, THOUGH.

10:55.786 --> 10:57.287
OKAY?

10:57.287 --> 10:59.229
JUST, UH, EXCUSE ME.

10:59.229 --> 11:02.733
YES.
HI. WOULD YOU SIT
WITH MRS. STURGEON?

11:02.733 --> 11:04.935
THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG DAY,

11:04.935 --> 11:08.438
AND YOU ALL NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF EACH OTHER. OKAY?
OKAY.

11:08.438 --> 11:12.442
(indistinct conversations
continue)

11:12.442 --> 11:15.145
You can put in a shunt
and then do a graft.

11:15.145 --> 11:18.749
DO YOU EVEN HAVE PRIVILEGES
HERE ANYMORE?
Whether I have privileges or not
isn't the point.

11:18.749 --> 11:20.981
Karev's right.
KAREV IS NOT ON THIS CASE
ANYMORE.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.984
Dr. Stark, please, just take
the time to do the graft,

11:23.984 --> 11:28.118
and you can save her leg.
I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT CAN
AND CAN'T BE DONE, DR. ROBBINS.

11:28.118 --> 11:30.420
I HAVE BIGGER FISH TO FRY,

11:30.420 --> 11:32.422
AND THIS WAS
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL OF YOU.

11:32.422 --> 11:35.766
I AM ALL DONE
ENGAGING WITH IT.
(buzzes)

11:35.766 --> 11:38.068
ALL RIGHT. GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY O.R., KAREV.

11:38.068 --> 11:41.071
I'm sorry. I am unprofessional?
I'm unprofess--I--

11:41.071 --> 11:43.133
Body block him, Karev.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.776
Don't let him near that leg.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.310
(siren wails)

11:50.310 --> 11:52.312
AH, HE'S GOT SOME BLOOD
IN HIS CHEST,

11:52.312 --> 11:53.814
BUT THE BULLET'S NOT THERE.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.316
IT'S NOT IN HIS LEG
OR IN HIS ARM. KEPNER.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.849
UM... UH, WE SHOULD
PUT IN A CHEST TUBE

11:58.849 --> 12:00.350
AND GET MORE STUDIES

12:00.350 --> 12:02.422
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.424
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
WE CAN WAKE HIM UP

12:04.424 --> 12:06.927
WHILE WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE STUDIES?
WE COULD REVERSE HIS PAIN MEDS,

12:06.927 --> 12:08.929
BUT IT WOULD BE
A PRETTY TRAUMATIC AWAKENING.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.431
HE'D BE IN A LOT OF PAIN.
CHIEF, I'M GETTING ALL SORTS
OF CONFLICTING REPORTS

12:11.431 --> 12:14.034
AS TO WHAT THE SHOOTER
LOOKS LIKE.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.266
YOU KNOW, KIDS, UH, IN SHOCK,
THEY DON'T REMEMBER,

12:16.266 --> 12:18.268
BUT COPS ARE TRAINED
TO REMEMBER.

12:18.268 --> 12:20.771
I DON'T KNOW
IF THERE'S A SECOND SHOOTER,

12:20.771 --> 12:22.773
IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF PLOT,

12:22.773 --> 12:24.945
BUT UNTIL I HAVE A POSITIVE
I.D., I'VE GOT NOTHING.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.047
BELIEVE ME, FAZ WOULD RATHER
FEEL SOME PAIN

12:27.047 --> 12:28.779
IF HE CAN I.D. THE SHOOTER
FOR ME.

12:28.779 --> 12:30.781
OKAY, I'LL REVERSE THE MEDS.
KEPNER.
OKAY.

12:30.781 --> 12:33.383
LET'S SET UP THE CHEST TUBE.
CHIEF WEBBER, THIS GUY
YOU REPLACED ME WITH

12:33.383 --> 12:35.886
IS A STUDY IN INCOMPETENCE.
NOT NOW, ROBBINS.

12:35.886 --> 12:38.358
NO, NO, YES, NOW, BECAUSE
DR. INCOMPETENCE IS ABOUT TO

12:38.358 --> 12:40.530
HACK OFF
A PERFECTLY GOOD LEG.
ROBBINS, I'M PRETTY BUSY HERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

12:40.530 --> 12:43.763
GIVE ME PRIVILEGES.
IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK.
OF COURSE YOU HAVE PRIVILEGES.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.395
OKAY. THANK YOU.

12:45.395 --> 12:49.099
IT'S NOT AN EASY DAY
TO BE THE MAN IN CHARGE.

12:49.099 --> 12:50.971
(scoffs)

12:50.971 --> 12:53.804
(indistinct conversations)

12:53.804 --> 12:56.376
TORRES! O.R. 2 RIGHT NOW.
9-1-1!

12:56.376 --> 12:58.378
WHAT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.450
I NEED SCRUBS.
UH...

13:00.450 --> 13:03.783
OKAY, BAILEY, CAN YOU
TAKE OVER FOR ME HERE?
OH. OKAY, EXCUSE ME.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.086
THIS IS, UH, CHUCK FOWLER.
HE'S 21 YEARS OLD.

13:06.086 --> 13:09.089
ZONE TWO INJURY OF THE NECK,
SECONDARY TO GRAZE G.S.W.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.791
HE HAS A HEMATOMA AND A C.T.
ANGIO'S BEEN ORDERED.
OKAY.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.193
THANK YOU.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.895
HOW YOU DOING, CHUCK?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.467
WHO WALKS INTO A CLASSROOM
WITH AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON?

13:17.467 --> 13:18.969
WHO DOES THAT?

13:18.969 --> 13:21.071
I DON'T KNOW.

13:21.071 --> 13:23.834
I DON'T KNOW.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.105
OKAY, HERE I GO.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.837
(inhales sharply)

13:26.837 --> 13:29.239
I'M A WRESTLER, MAN.
I'M ALL-STATE.

13:29.239 --> 13:32.242
SAW OR NO SAW, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING PAST ME.
KAREV, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

13:32.242 --> 13:34.845
HE'S LOST HIS MIND.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

13:34.845 --> 13:37.888
HE'S LOST HIS MIND, AND HE
IS DESTROYING HIS CAREER.

13:37.888 --> 13:40.390
THAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!
CHECK IT OUT, TORRES.

13:40.390 --> 13:42.552
15 YEAR OLD,
G.S.W. TO THE THIGH

13:42.552 --> 13:44.054
WITH COMMINUTED
FEMUR FRACTURE.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.526
LACERATION TO THE SUPERFICIAL
FEMORAL ARTERY. HA!

13:46.526 --> 13:48.929
GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.331
WHAT ABOUT HER NERVES?
ARE HER NERVES SALVAGEABLE?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.334
KID WAS MOVING HER LEG
BEFORE WE PUT HER UNDER.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.337
THEY'RE INTACT.
SHE HAS A LIFE-THREATENING
HEMORRHAGE IN HER LEG

13:57.337 --> 14:01.011
AND MULTI-ORGAN INJURIES
IN HER ABDOMEN.
ABDOMINAL BLEEDING
IS UNDER CONTROL FOR NOW.

14:01.011 --> 14:03.513
THANKS SO MUCH, DAVE.
I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THERE.

14:03.513 --> 14:06.516
WELL, I CAN PUT IN A TRACTION
PIN TO STABILIZE THE FEMUR.
RIGHT?

14:06.516 --> 14:10.120
AND THEN WE CAN USE A GRAFT
TO RESTORE BLOOD FLOW.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.122
I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE

14:12.122 --> 14:14.885
IN MY LIFE!
DR. STARK, YOU'RE NEW HERE,
BUT IN THIS HOSPITAL,

14:14.885 --> 14:17.257
WE TAKE SHOOTINGS PERSONALLY,
AND I CAN SAVE THIS LEG.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.960
SO ARE YOU GONNA
WORK WITH ME OR NOT?
(door opens)

14:19.960 --> 14:22.592
NO, NO, I AM. DR. STARK, I'VE
JUST SPOKEN WITH CHIEF WEBBER.

14:22.592 --> 14:25.035
THIS IS MY PATIENT NOW.
WHAT?!

14:25.035 --> 14:27.637
THIS IS... (laughs)

14:27.637 --> 14:29.299
TH-TH-TH--
(clatters)

14:29.299 --> 14:30.600
THIS...

14:30.600 --> 14:32.372
YES!

14:32.372 --> 14:33.873
KAREV, YOU GOTTA GO, TOO.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.306
THE PIT'S FULL OF KIDS
THAT NEED DOCTORS,

14:36.306 --> 14:39.149
AND WE CAN HANDLE THIS ONE
WITHOUT YOU, OKAY?
THAT'S COOL.
MY WORK IS DONE.

14:39.149 --> 14:41.011
HA! ALL-STATE, BABY!

14:41.011 --> 14:43.883
(surgical staff laughs)

14:43.883 --> 14:45.515
(laughs)

14:45.515 --> 14:48.188
YOU SEE THAT BRIDGING VEIN?

14:48.188 --> 14:50.190
YOU'LL HAVE TO COMPROMISE IT

14:50.190 --> 14:52.392
IF YOU'RE GONNA PULL
THE SKULL FLAP BACK.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.924
MM-HMM.

14:53.924 --> 14:55.625
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:55.625 --> 14:57.497
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.000
I'M GONNA GO
UPDATE THE WIFE AGAIN.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.303
DR. GREY, YOU'RE A SURGEON,
NOT A SOCIAL WORKER.
YOU CAN'T SPARE ME
FOR FIVE MINUTES?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.635
AND YOU HAVE A PATIENT OPEN
ON THE TABLE.

15:05.635 --> 15:07.677
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE WHOLE STORY.

15:07.677 --> 15:10.480
DON'T START THIS AGAIN.
WELL, THE OTHER PART
OF THE STORY

15:10.480 --> 15:14.084
IS THAT HE'S GOT A WIFE WHO'S
PANICKING IN THE WAITING ROOM--
ALL RIGHT, FINE. GO.
JUST LET ME CONCENTRATE.

15:14.084 --> 15:17.017
I'LL BE QUICK.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.220
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.
HE'S READY.

15:22.292 --> 15:24.624
LOOK,
I'M GONNA PUSH THE NALOXONE.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.097
HE'S GONNA WAKE UP
AND HE'S GONNA HURT.

15:27.097 --> 15:30.400
SO TALK QUICK, OKAY?
READY.

15:34.664 --> 15:36.666
(coughs)
(monitor beeping erratically)

15:36.666 --> 15:39.039
FAZ, IT'S MARTY.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.641
(groans)
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

15:41.641 --> 15:43.713
OH, GOD. IT HURTS. (groans)

15:43.713 --> 15:45.976
AAH! OH, GOD!

15:45.976 --> 15:48.948
FAZ, I NEED YOU TO DESCRIBE
THE SHOOTER.
(coughs)

15:48.948 --> 15:51.551
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME, BUD?
(groans)

15:53.984 --> 15:55.485
(elevator bell dings)

15:55.485 --> 15:56.987
CHIEF WEBBER.

15:56.987 --> 16:00.130
DID YOU REALLY APPROVE
OF ROBBINS STORMING MY O.R.,

16:00.130 --> 16:03.463
STEALING MY PATIENT,
HUMILIATING ME PUBLICLY?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.965
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PATIENTS
TO GO AROUND, DR. STARK.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.967
JUMP IN AND FIND ONE.
I WILL NOT.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.970
WHAT I WILL DO IS TO GO BACK
TO MY PATIENT IN MY O.R.--

16:10.970 --> 16:13.043
GO BE A DAMN DOCTOR!

16:13.043 --> 16:16.446
PEOPLE ARE DYING.
NOW GO SAVE A LIFE, RIGHT NOW!

16:22.552 --> 16:24.554
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

16:24.554 --> 16:26.556
JUST HANG ON.
I NEED THE INFO.

16:26.556 --> 16:28.218
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.
EXCUSE ME...

16:28.218 --> 16:30.220
DR. HUNT. I'M FREE.
DO YOU NEED ME?

16:30.220 --> 16:33.023
I'M FREE. DR. HUNT.

16:33.023 --> 16:36.096
THEY JUST FOUND ANOTHER
CLASSROOM FULL OF VICTIMS.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.768
WE'RE GETTING
AT LEAST A DOZEN MORE.
CRAP.

16:38.768 --> 16:40.770
AND WE'RE OUT OF O.R.s.
WHAT?

16:40.770 --> 16:43.073
WE'RE OUT OF O.R.s,
WE'RE OUT OF SPACE,

16:43.073 --> 16:45.075
AND ALL THE OTHER HOSPITALS
ARE AT CAPACITY.

16:45.075 --> 16:48.478
IF ANY--ANY OF THEM
NEED SURGERY, WE'RE...

16:48.478 --> 16:51.111
WE'RE SCREWED.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.744
(man continues
speaking indistinctly on TV)

16:54.744 --> 16:56.746
(indistinct conversations)

16:56.746 --> 16:58.748
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:58.748 --> 17:01.251
(suction gurgling)

17:01.251 --> 17:03.453
DR. ALTMAN,

17:03.453 --> 17:05.755
YOU HAVE A G.S.W. TO THE CHEST?

17:05.755 --> 17:07.457
DR. YANG.

17:07.457 --> 17:09.459
DR. YANG WAS ON THE SCENE.

17:09.459 --> 17:11.701
SHE PERFORMED AN EMERGENCY
THORACOTOMY IN THE FIELD.

17:11.701 --> 17:13.703
YOU ALL RIGHT, DR. YANG?

17:13.703 --> 17:16.066
YES, SIR. I'M STAYING,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

17:16.066 --> 17:19.369
UH, DR. YANG, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOUR PATIENT WAS WEARING

17:19.369 --> 17:22.372
OR WHERE HIS CLOTHES ARE?
UH, THEY WERE CUT OFF
AT THE SCENE.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.814
IT WAS, UM, A GREEN HOODIE,
JEANS.

17:24.814 --> 17:28.718
IS HE A REDHEAD, ABOUT 20?

17:28.718 --> 17:30.520
(suction gurgling)

17:30.520 --> 17:32.222
YES.

17:32.222 --> 17:34.084
UH, WHY, SIR?

17:34.084 --> 17:36.086
SEND ME DOWN
ANY BULLET FRAGMENTS

17:36.086 --> 17:39.229
YOU PULL OUT OF HIS BODY.

17:39.229 --> 17:40.830
CHIEF, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:40.830 --> 17:42.832
(gurgling continues)

17:42.832 --> 17:45.165
YOUR PATIENT'S THE SHOOTER.

17:47.137 --> 17:49.799
SEND DOWN ANY BULLETS
IMMEDIATELY.

17:49.799 --> 17:52.772
THEY'RE EVIDENCE.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.074
(gurgling continues)

17:55.074 --> 17:58.077
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:07.387 --> 18:09.659
(Teddy) OKAY, UM...

18:09.659 --> 18:13.223
OKAY. (clears throat)
WHERE WERE WE?

18:13.223 --> 18:15.295
YOU WERE ABOUT
TO RECONSTRUCT THE VENTRICLE.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.368
RIGHT. RIGHT.
THANK YOU. OKAY.

18:18.368 --> 18:20.270
HAND ME 3-0 ETHIBOND, PLEASE.

18:20.270 --> 18:22.272
I'M SORRY.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.874
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T,
DR. ALTMAN.

18:24.874 --> 18:27.537
YOU CAN'T HAND ME
THE ETHIBOND?

18:27.537 --> 18:30.440
I CAN'T.
SHE CAN'T SAVE THIS GUY...

18:30.440 --> 18:32.712
IS WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.714
HE JUST SHOT UP
DOZENS OF PEOPLE,

18:34.714 --> 18:37.587
AND THIS SURGERY
IS GONNA TAKE ALL DAY.
DR. AVERY.

18:37.587 --> 18:39.589
THAT'S TAKING THREE DOCTORS
AND FOUR NURSES AWAY

18:39.589 --> 18:41.391
FROM HELPING OTHER PEOPLE,

18:41.391 --> 18:45.555
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T SHOOT UP
A CAMPUS FULL OF INNOCENT KIDS--
DR. AVERY.

18:45.555 --> 18:48.398
I OPERATED ON IRAQI SOLDIERS
WHO BLEW UP DOZENS OF OUR GUYS.

18:48.398 --> 18:51.801
I DIDN'T LIKE IT,
BUT I DID IT,

18:51.801 --> 18:54.804
BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR,
AND I TOOK AN OATH.

18:54.804 --> 18:57.867
YOU'RE NOT A JURY
OR A JUDGE.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.869
IF THERE'S A LIFE
TO BE SAVED,

18:59.869 --> 19:01.811
WE SAVE THAT LIFE,
REGARDLESS--

19:01.811 --> 19:03.843
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.615
NO.

19:07.617 --> 19:09.319
(door opens)

19:09.319 --> 19:10.820
ANYONE ELSE?

19:10.820 --> 19:13.823
I'M SORRY.

19:13.823 --> 19:16.386
(door opens)

19:18.928 --> 19:22.362
DR. YANG...

19:22.362 --> 19:25.465
ARE YOU STAYING?

19:25.465 --> 19:28.468
YES.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.700
ALL RIGHT.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.602
OKAY, GREAT.

19:32.602 --> 19:35.545
UH, 3-0 ETHIBOND, PLEASE.

19:35.545 --> 19:38.548
(monitor beeping erratically)
OH, COME ON, COME ON.
PRESS ON THE CRICOID MORE.

19:38.548 --> 19:41.551
I CAN'T SEE THE CORDS.
COME ON, FAZ. STAY WITH ME.
KEPNER.

19:41.551 --> 19:43.713
HIS VITALS STARTED DROPPING.
X-RAYS WERE CLEAR,

19:43.713 --> 19:46.356
NO BULLET,
SO I DID AN ULTRASOUND.

19:46.356 --> 19:48.358
FOUND BLOOD IN THE BELLY.

19:48.358 --> 19:50.360
OKAY, WE NEED ALL AVAILABLE
SURGICAL EQUIPMENT.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.191
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT? QUICKLY.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.663
GOOD.
READY FOR TRANSPORT.

19:53.663 --> 19:56.596
UH, CHIEF. YOU SHOULD STAY
IN THAT TRAUMA ROOM.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.828
THERE ARE NO O.R.s. GET
THE CHIEF AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST.

19:58.828 --> 20:01.401
(woman) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.
WHAT? I-I GOT A COP
WITH BLOOD IN HIS BELLY,

20:01.401 --> 20:03.833
THE SAME COP THAT TOOK DOWN
THE SHOOTER.

20:03.833 --> 20:07.307
YOU'RE SAYING I HAVE TO OPERATE
ON HIM IN A TRAUMA ROOM?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.679
I'M SAYING, IT'S YOUR
BEST OPTION RIGHT NOW.
SIR, HIS PRESSURE'S DROPPING.

20:09.679 --> 20:12.542
(monitor beeping erratically)
HUNT. I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, HUNT.

20:12.542 --> 20:15.615
YES, SIR. SO DO I.
KEPNER, LOCK HIM DOWN IN THERE

20:15.615 --> 20:18.448
AND GET ME
A MAJOR PROCEDURES TRAY NOW.
OKAY.

20:18.448 --> 20:20.550
AVERY, IS ALTMAN DONE YET?
(Richard) HURRY, HURRY.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.522
NO, AND WHILE WE'VE GOT A COP
BLEEDING OUT DOWN HERE.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.524
SHE'S OCCUPYING
A PERFECTLY GOOD O.R.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.497
GOING TO EXTREME MEASURES
TO SAVE THE DAMN SHOOTER.

20:27.497 --> 20:30.500
(lowered voice)
I TRIED TALKING TO HER.
WAIT. ALTMAN'S GUY
IS THE SHOOTER?

20:30.500 --> 20:33.503
D-DOES CRISTINA KNOW THAT?
YEAH. SO DOES ALTMAN.
I WALKED OUT.

20:33.503 --> 20:35.935
ALL RIGHT. GO TO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM. THERE IS INCOMING.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.938
KEPNER, I NEED YOU TO GO
TO OUTPATIENT RECOVERY.
I NEED TO GET THESE SUPPLIES
TO THE CHIEF.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.811
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. HEY, YOU.
TAKE THIS TO THE CHIEF

20:41.811 --> 20:43.613
IN TRAUMA ONE.
OKAY, DOCTOR.

20:43.613 --> 20:46.316
GO TO OUTPATIENT RECOVERY
RIGHT NOW AND OVERSEE IT.
WHAT--WHAT AM I DOING?

20:46.316 --> 20:48.578
IT'S LIKE A MOBILE TRAUMA UNIT.
IT'S LIKE A MASH UNIT.

20:48.578 --> 20:51.721
I'LL BE THERE IN A MOMENT.
WAIT, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

20:51.721 --> 20:54.724
YOU WERE TRAINED FOR THIS,
KEPNER. OVERSEE IT.
(whispers) OH.

20:54.724 --> 20:56.956
OKAY, COMING THROUGH.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.758
(pump hisses and clicks)

20:58.758 --> 21:02.031
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE MAD
AT ME. I DO.
NO.

21:02.031 --> 21:04.664
I EVEN UNDERSTAND YOU SLAMMING
THE DOOR IN MY FACE, BUT--

21:04.664 --> 21:06.996
NO. NO, YOU WILL NOT
HOLD ME HOSTAGE

21:06.996 --> 21:08.998
AND MAKE ME LISTEN TO YOU.

21:08.998 --> 21:12.001
I AM REBUILDING THE LEG
OF A KID WHO'S BEEN SHOT.

21:12.001 --> 21:14.804
THAT'S--THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.506
NO TALKING.

21:16.506 --> 21:18.478
NONE.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.611
(suction gurgling)

21:21.611 --> 21:24.614
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:24.614 --> 21:27.617
(suction gurgling)

21:41.531 --> 21:44.534
OKAY, IF ANYONE'S FREE,
WE HAVE AN INCOMING PATIENT.

21:44.534 --> 21:47.737
G.S.W. TO THE FLANK
WITH ACTIVE HEMORRHAGE.

21:47.737 --> 21:49.739
WHY ARE WE STILL ACCEPTING
CRITICAL CASES?

21:49.739 --> 21:51.911
I'M COMING, KEPNER.
(April) THANK YOU.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.943
UH, LOOK,
CONTINUE TO DEBRIDE OUT

21:53.943 --> 21:57.417
THE DEVITALIZED TISSUE
AND REPAIR THE INJURED VESSEL.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.719
YOU'RE SERIOUS?
WHAT, YOU WANT TO TAKE

21:59.719 --> 22:01.921
THE INCOMING G.S.W.
TO THE FLANK?

22:01.921 --> 22:05.525
ALL RIGHT, THEN. JUST, UH,
THERE'S ENOUGH SURGEONS AROUND

22:05.525 --> 22:07.026
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.098
JUST TAKE CARE OF CHUCK.

22:09.098 --> 22:10.600
OKAY, CHUCK.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.463
I'M GONNA BE DOING
A VASCULAR REPAIR ON YOU

22:13.463 --> 22:16.366
IN A FREAKIN' MOSH PIT.

22:19.369 --> 22:22.772
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:22.772 --> 22:24.774
(monitor beeping erratically)

22:24.774 --> 22:26.676
OH, SON OF A BITCH.

22:26.676 --> 22:28.478
I.C.P.'s STILL 45.

22:28.478 --> 22:30.480
HIS BRAIN
IS STILL SWELLING.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.482
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REMOVE
THE OTHER SIDE.

22:32.482 --> 22:35.024
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE OFF
BOTH SIDES OF HIS SKULL?
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE
THIS STRIP HERE

22:35.024 --> 22:37.026
THAT COVERS THE UPPER
SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS.

22:37.026 --> 22:40.430
LET'S GET
THE OTHER SIDE PREPPED.
WELL, I'M GONNA GO
UPDATE THE WIFE.

22:40.430 --> 22:42.862
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU SO INTERESTED
IN UPDATING THE WIFE

22:42.862 --> 22:45.865
IN THE WAITING ROOM
THAN DOING THIS?
SINCE I WAS THE WIFE
IN THE WAITING ROOM, DEREK.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.538
I MEAN, HONESTLY, DO YOU THINK
YOU AND CRISTINA

22:48.538 --> 22:51.541
ARE THE ONLY TWO WHO HAVE
EVER BEEN THROUGH A TRAUMA?
STOP. DON'T DO THAT. DO NOT
BRING CRISTINA BACK INTO THIS.

22:51.541 --> 22:54.143
YOU DON'T GET TO ACT
LIKE A SPOILED LITTLE BRAT

22:54.143 --> 22:56.646
IN MY O.R.
WHY IS IT OKAY FOR CRISTINA
TO DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS,

22:56.646 --> 22:58.648
BUT IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ME,

22:58.648 --> 23:01.010
BECAUSE I'M NOT HIDING UNDER
O.R. TABLES OR BARTENDING?
MEREDITH.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.752
I MEAN, HONESTLY,

23:02.752 --> 23:05.455
YOU AND CRISTINA ARE SO BUSY
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER,

23:05.455 --> 23:08.518
HAVE YOU EVEN NOTICED THAT
I WENT THROUGH A TRAUMA, TOO?

23:08.518 --> 23:10.890
I WAS THE WIFE
IN THE WAITING ROOM, DEREK.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.523
AND IT'S SO HARD TO BE
THE WIFE IN THE WAITING ROOM,

23:13.523 --> 23:15.525
SO HARD
THAT I WALKED INTO THE O.R.

23:15.525 --> 23:17.527
WHILE THE SHOOTER
HAD A GUN TO YOU

23:17.527 --> 23:19.529
AND TOLD HIM
TO SHOOT ME INSTEAD.

23:19.529 --> 23:21.831
THAT'S HOW HARD IT IS TO BE
THE WIFE IN THE WAITING ROOM.

23:21.831 --> 23:24.604
EXCUSE ME. I'M GONNA GO
UPDATE MY PATIENT.
(sighs)

23:24.604 --> 23:28.037
(monitor beeping erratically)

23:30.510 --> 23:32.712
OKAY.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.644
OKAY.

23:34.644 --> 23:36.916
I'M SORRY.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.620
OKAY, LET'S CONTINUE ON.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.493
(beeping continues)

23:54.634 --> 23:57.467
DR. SHEPHERD
IS GOING TO REMOVE

23:57.467 --> 23:59.469
THE OTHER HALF
OF YOUR HUSBAND'S SKULL.

23:59.469 --> 24:01.771
IF ALL GOES WELL
IN THE O.R.,

24:01.771 --> 24:03.873
HE'LL THEN FREEZE THE SKULL

24:03.873 --> 24:06.616
TO KEEP THE BONES FROM DYING,
AND THEN HE'LL SEW

24:06.616 --> 24:08.948
THE SCALP AND THE MUSCLE
BACK OVER THE EXPOSED BRAIN.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.782
LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M SORRY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I KNOW IT SOUNDS FRIGHTENING
AND EXTREME,

24:12.782 --> 24:14.453
AND IT IS.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.455
BUT DR. SHEPHERD
IS VERY GOOD.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.759
AND I'LL--I'LL COME OUT
AND KEEP YOU POSTED, OKAY?

24:19.759 --> 24:22.492
OKAY.
OKAY.

24:22.492 --> 24:25.535
I'M LOOKING
FOR THE SACKETT FAMILY.

24:25.535 --> 24:27.897
ANYBODY HERE
FOR A JOHN SACKETT?

24:27.897 --> 24:31.100
EXCUSE ME. IS ANYONE HERE
RELATED TO JARED SWORK?

24:31.100 --> 24:33.172
YES. THAT'S MY SON.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.204
HOW IS HE? IS HE OKAY?

24:35.204 --> 24:38.648
MA'AM, WOULD YOU MIND
COMING WITH ME?

24:38.648 --> 24:40.209
(indistinct conversations)

24:40.209 --> 24:41.881
HERE YOU GO, MAN.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.653
THANKS, MAN.

24:43.653 --> 24:47.517
(crying) MY SON WAS SHOT.
HE WASN'T THE SHOOTER.

24:47.517 --> 24:49.559
NO. NO!

24:49.559 --> 24:51.691
MY SON DIDN'T DO THIS!

24:51.691 --> 24:54.864
NO, NO, NO.

24:54.864 --> 24:57.567
(sobs) OH.

24:57.567 --> 25:01.270
(multiple monitors
beeping rhythmically)

25:01.270 --> 25:04.203
(indistinct conversations)

25:04.203 --> 25:07.076
WHAT THE HELL?
SLOAN, MOVE ON.

25:07.076 --> 25:09.078
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS.
KICK IT LATER.

25:09.078 --> 25:11.741
WE'VE GOT A KID IN THREE
WITH A G.S.W. TO THE SHOULDER,

25:11.741 --> 25:14.243
AND WE NEED THIS SPACE
FOR INCOMING.
FINE, BUT MY NAME'S
NOT GOING ON THIS CHART.

25:14.243 --> 25:16.746
THAT'S A HACK JOB YOU DID.
(Lexie) SOMEBODY
GET DR. NELSON HERE. NOW.

25:16.746 --> 25:19.248
I'LL GET GREY.
YOU GET BED THREE.
MM-HMM.

25:19.248 --> 25:21.250
CLEAN IT AND WRAP IT.
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.022
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:23.022 --> 25:24.694
SHE'S GOT
AN INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE.

25:24.694 --> 25:26.556
UH, HER PUPIL JUST BLEW.

25:26.556 --> 25:28.598
SHE NEEDS BURR HOLES
AND A--AND A TRAUMA FLAP.

25:28.598 --> 25:30.600
WE GOTTA EVACUATE THAT CLOT.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.162
OKAY, WE CAN DO THAT.
WE CAN DO THAT.

25:33.162 --> 25:36.235
(beeping continues)

25:39.709 --> 25:42.612
(indistinct conversations)

25:42.612 --> 25:44.774
I NEED SOME HANDS
OVER HERE, AVERY.

25:44.774 --> 25:46.846
YEP.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.918
ARTERIAL REPAIR.
CAN YOU HOLD THAT?

25:48.918 --> 25:50.720
GOT IT.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.722
YOU KNOW, ALTMAN'S STILL
IN O.R. 1?

25:52.722 --> 25:54.724
SO YOU CAN'T CHOOSE
WHO YOU SAVE.

25:54.724 --> 25:56.626
YEAH, THAT'S APPARENTLY
THE PARTY LINE.

25:56.626 --> 25:58.127
THE SHOOTER'S SICK.

25:58.127 --> 26:00.189
NOBODY DOES THIS
IN THEIR RIGHT MIND.

26:00.189 --> 26:02.862
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
MY BROTHER
JUST HAD A PSYCHOTIC BREAK

26:02.862 --> 26:05.595
AND TRIED TO KILL MY SISTER.
AND IF HE GOT HURT,

26:05.595 --> 26:07.637
EVEN IF HE GOT HURT
HURTING PEOPLE,

26:07.637 --> 26:09.268
I WOULD WANT HIS DOCTORS

26:09.268 --> 26:11.270
TO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD
TO SAVE HIM.

26:11.270 --> 26:14.674
NO MATTER WHAT HE DID,
HE'S STILL MY LITTLE BROTHER.

26:16.205 --> 26:18.678
MAKING THE INCISION.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.912
READY WITH THE DRILL?
YEAH.

26:25.715 --> 26:28.958
(whirs)

26:28.958 --> 26:31.190
NO. YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.361
MARK.

26:32.361 --> 26:34.193
SHE'S YOUR PATIENT,
DR. GREY.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.595
YOU'RE GONNA SAVE HER LIFE.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.668
READY?

26:41.831 --> 26:43.803
GENTLY.
(whirring)

26:43.803 --> 26:46.676
RIGHT THERE.

26:46.676 --> 26:48.137
PERFECT.

26:48.137 --> 26:49.709
PERFECT.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.881
(monitor beeping erratically)
DAMN IT. HE'S CRASHING.

26:51.881 --> 26:53.983
I NEED A CRASH CART
IN HERE NOW.

26:53.983 --> 26:57.116
(beeping continues)

27:00.750 --> 27:02.822
HEY, DO NOT DIE, CHUCK.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.755
YOU HEAR ME? THAT SHOOTER
DOES NOT GET TO WIN THIS.

27:05.755 --> 27:07.857
YOU COME BACK.

27:07.857 --> 27:09.799
HERE GOES.
(defibrillator whines)

27:09.799 --> 27:12.031
CLEAR.
(thunks)

27:12.031 --> 27:13.763
COME ON.
(beeping continues)

27:13.763 --> 27:15.735
OH.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.738
COME BACK...
RIGHT NOW, CHARLES.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.741
(defibrillator whines)
COME BACK TO YOUR BODY
RIGHT NOW.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.642
CLEAR.
(thunks)

27:23.642 --> 27:26.215
(beeping continues)

27:28.077 --> 27:31.851
YOU BASTARD! YOU BETTER
SEND THIS BOY BACK RIGHT NOW!

27:31.851 --> 27:33.853
(defibrillator whines)
CLEAR!

27:33.853 --> 27:35.654
(thunks)

27:35.654 --> 27:38.788
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:44.734 --> 27:48.297
SORRY ABOUT
THE BASTARD THING.

27:48.297 --> 27:51.300
(beeping continues)

27:54.043 --> 27:55.875
(indistinct conversations)

27:55.875 --> 27:58.177

continue)

28:04.784 --> 28:07.056
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

28:07.056 --> 28:09.358
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO SEE.

28:09.358 --> 28:12.021
