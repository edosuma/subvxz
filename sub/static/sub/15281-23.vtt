00:02.360 --> 00:05.100
If the remains aren't related to the
same killer, where's he been for 10 years?

00:05.110 --> 00:08.510
Killing. Unsolved case
files going back 30 years.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.260
The same M.O. Right rib bone is missing.

00:11.270 --> 00:12.160
I'm Frank.

00:12.170 --> 00:15.730
I thought I'd seen the very worst of
what humanity had to offer until you.

00:15.740 --> 00:20.320
A killing machine- incapable
of remorse, compassion, love.

00:20.330 --> 00:24.400
Early toxicological investigations of the
victims' blood indicated high levels of ketamine.

00:24.410 --> 00:26.460
Ketamine is primarily
a horse tranquilizer.

00:26.470 --> 00:27.510
Jane, run.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.040
In street lingo it's known as
being stuck in the "k" hole.

00:30.050 --> 00:32.689
Whatever it is he came for
is coming here to this diner.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.130
Jane.

00:34.140 --> 00:36.300
He has the children, Jane.

00:36.310 --> 00:39.150
Give me Jane, and they'll
have their children back.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.090
With Jane in my life, I will
never harm another human being.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.120
The most prolific serial killer ever.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

01:02.920 --> 01:05.980
- What do you want, honey?
- Oh, something flowery.

01:05.990 --> 01:09.070
Flowery. Ok, well, help me out here.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.720
Purple?

01:11.310 --> 01:13.250
- Purple - Uh, maybe-maybe
not purple. Uh-

01:13.260 --> 01:16.370
- Come on, man.
- More of a mix of something. Um...

01:16.380 --> 01:17.910
You're killing me
here. Make up your mind.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.770
- Just back off, pal.
- What did I do?

01:19.780 --> 01:22.060
I wasn't talking to you. I guess roses.

01:22.070 --> 01:25.360
- Are you on a date? - No, uh, hold
on- hold on the roses, will you?

01:25.370 --> 01:27.320
- And you didn't tell me?
- Tell you what? I'm not on a date.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.750
- I'm just buying flowers.
- For who?

01:29.760 --> 01:31.670
Old college friend.
Hotch, tell me something.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.270
- Do roses say the wrong thing?
- What do you want to say?

01:34.280 --> 01:36.580
Welcome, hi, good to see
you, sorry I'm so damn late.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.250
Uh, roses say more than that.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.640
Face it, buddy. You want
some action, it's the roses.

01:40.650 --> 01:42.190
She's right.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.430
Do you have a yellow flower- they're
like, um- they're little yellow flowers.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.970
They look like Dandelions or
like weeds, but they're not weeds.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.490
They have a little black spot in the middle. But they
don't have a black spot, they're sort of round and puffy.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.250
Button mums.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.630
Do you have those? Can I
see what those look like?

01:53.640 --> 01:56.690
- It's a date.
- I'm not on a date...exactly.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.730
Well, how about some white stuff
and... you know, make it look...happy.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.540
- Baby's Breath.
- Ok, great. Sorry!

02:01.550 --> 02:03.440
I don't know what else,
whatever looks good.

02:03.450 --> 02:04.740
So what do you need?

02:04.750 --> 02:09.199
I got a request from safe guard for
personnel files on certain agents.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.580
So it's an annual evaluation. Who cares?

02:11.590 --> 02:13.060
It's 6 months early, Jason.

02:13.070 --> 02:15.370
It's not a routine evaluation.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.020
I think it's an assessment of the B.A.U

02:18.030 --> 02:20.610
They're redistributing funds, they're
making cuts in all departments.

02:20.620 --> 02:23.470
So what are they going to take,
the jet? I prefer trains anyway.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.390
Well,I think we may lose more than that.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.280
It's been a hard year for us, Jason.

02:27.290 --> 02:29.790
You know. What happened
to Morgan in Chicago.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.690
We both know about Reid's issues.
Elle Greenaway's suspect killed.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.290
- It all adds up.
- To what?

02:35.300 --> 02:37.470
The only file they
didn't request was mine.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.140
$30? What, are you kidding me?

02:39.150 --> 02:40.950
- You should have seen the price of the roses.
- Oh, lord.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.270
Thanks. Hey, Hotch, you're
the best unit chief I know.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.360
Jason, I'm the only unit chief you know.

02:46.370 --> 02:50.210
Look, you need a break. Go
home, kiss your family, and...

02:52.750 --> 02:55.030
Impossible.

02:55.630 --> 02:57.810
What?

02:57.820 --> 03:01.820
I thought I...I
thought-never mind.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.780
We both need a break.

03:03.790 --> 03:06.540
- Jason?
- Yeah?

03:06.550 --> 03:09.250
Button Mums are something
you give your mother.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.340
Yeah.

03:12.350 --> 03:15.150
- Good night.
- Good night.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.030
Have fun.

03:20.930 --> 03:23.760
Sarah, sorry I'm so late. I
got caught up at the office.

03:23.770 --> 03:28.370
What is your fascination
with birds, Jason?

03:28.930 --> 03:30.870
Who is this?

03:30.880 --> 03:35.670
Paintings of birds, etchings
of birds, books about birds.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.350
Frank, please. Please don't hurt her.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.870
Birders can be extremely
single-minded in their pursuits.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.220
Almost...obsessional.

03:44.230 --> 03:47.610
She's innocent. She's somebody
I knew a long time ago.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.950
Are you obsessional, Jason?

03:49.960 --> 03:53.030
Do you lie awake at night
and think about the...

03:53.040 --> 03:56.220
- bird that got away?
- Please, Frank.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.720
Please don't involve her.

03:57.730 --> 04:00.540
Have you seen my Jane lately, Jason?

04:00.550 --> 04:04.410
I know she came here, to Washington...

04:04.420 --> 04:07.330
to find you.

04:07.340 --> 04:10.820
- Frank...
- I want her back.

05:00.783 --> 05:05.953
I choose my friends for their good looks
my acquaintances for their good characters

05:05.963 --> 05:10.273
my enemies for their good
intellects. Oscar wilde.

05:18.713 --> 05:21.683
I've never seen you like this.

05:23.753 --> 05:26.103
You have not seen what I've seen.

05:26.113 --> 05:28.703
You chose the B.A.U.

05:28.713 --> 05:31.433
True. I enjoy my work.

05:31.443 --> 05:35.113
Even when in the pursuit
to understand why...

05:35.503 --> 05:37.933
A person feels the compelling need to

05:37.943 --> 05:41.723
brutally torture, murder

05:41.733 --> 05:45.713
and dismember a child, mother or father,

05:45.723 --> 05:47.823
an entire family.

05:47.833 --> 05:55.243
The unsubs, devoid of any morality,
humanity, remorse when caught,

05:56.193 --> 05:59.643
often come to believe that we're
the only ones who understand them.

05:59.653 --> 06:01.743
And they're right. We do.

06:01.753 --> 06:06.693
Otherwise...how could we catch them?

06:07.253 --> 06:09.923
Tell me what happened friday...

06:09.933 --> 06:12.133
after agent Gideon called you.

06:12.143 --> 06:15.473
About 7:15 I got a page
requesting the B.A.U

06:15.483 --> 06:19.713
At 181 Arthur Street.
Agent Gideon's apartment.

06:37.963 --> 06:40.063
Hotch.

06:40.823 --> 06:43.743
- Where's Gideon?
- I called his cell. It's right there.

06:43.753 --> 06:47.523
- It seems he left in a hurry.
- P.D. Thinks he did this?

06:47.533 --> 06:51.393
They have 6 witnesses who saw him running down
the street, covered in blood, wielding a gun.

06:51.403 --> 06:54.003
Ok, he was probably chasing the
son of a bitch who did do this.

06:54.013 --> 06:57.123
Either way, we're under strict orders not
to get in the way of the investigation.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.253
Gideon's a suspect,
we're his colleagues.

06:59.263 --> 07:02.373
Conflict of interest. There's
no way they'll ask for our help.

07:02.383 --> 07:04.413
Which he needs badly right now.

07:04.423 --> 07:07.063
- Well, who spoke to him last?
- I did, about 2 hours ago.

07:07.073 --> 07:09.083
What did he say?

07:09.093 --> 07:12.283
He said he was late for a date.

07:12.973 --> 07:16.253
- Do we even know who she is?
- An old school friend.

07:16.263 --> 07:17.973
We're conflicted out
of the investigation.

07:17.983 --> 07:22.993
We're just here to answer questions the M.P.D might
have, so we need to assess what we can while we can.

07:23.003 --> 07:25.343
Evisceration of the torso,
removal of various organs.

07:25.353 --> 07:27.483
The guy's clearly a
sexually sadistic psychopath.

07:27.493 --> 07:30.043
He's well-versed with a
scalpel. He's done this before.

07:30.053 --> 07:31.443
We need to at least get photos.

07:31.453 --> 07:36.093
J.J., Your cell phone- get as many as you
can as quickly as you can. Get them to Garcia.

07:37.103 --> 07:41.373
Oh, J.J...it's friday night.

07:41.383 --> 07:44.103
The cute guy from counterterrorism...

07:44.113 --> 07:48.513
3 cocktails in, I am looking at
second base, so this better be good.

07:48.523 --> 07:50.953
It's far from good.

07:54.473 --> 07:58.093
- Where are you?
- Gideon's apartment.

08:03.153 --> 08:06.163
No sign of forced entry. Why?

08:09.553 --> 08:11.763
Everything is as it was.

08:11.773 --> 08:14.493
Nothing has been disturbed.

08:14.503 --> 08:17.083
Wine poured but not drank.

08:18.233 --> 08:20.593
The victim simply let the assailant in.

08:20.603 --> 08:24.403
And why wouldn't she? She was
waiting for Gideon. It's his home.

08:26.043 --> 08:29.773
Forensics won't find any
defensive wounds. Why?

08:29.783 --> 08:32.472
Because she didn't defend
herself. She couldn't.

08:32.482 --> 08:35.373
He came here looking for
Gideon and he found her.

08:35.383 --> 08:37.263
Now, he knew he didn't
have a lot of time, but...

08:37.273 --> 08:41.732
here she is, and here he
stands- a sexual sadist.

08:41.743 --> 08:45.073
A psychopath with the need to kill
just as natural as his need to breathe.

08:45.083 --> 08:51.693
He moved swiftly, every stroke of his
blade exact, from lower torso to throat.

08:51.703 --> 08:56.923
She was awake the entire time,
until mercifully she passed away.

08:57.773 --> 09:01.923
The toxicology report will find
high levels of ketamine in her blood.

09:01.933 --> 09:06.443
He opened her up, removed her
lower-right rib bone, which is missing.

09:06.453 --> 09:09.733
Prentiss, left hand.

09:13.483 --> 09:15.223
That looks like part of the rib bone.

09:15.233 --> 09:18.903
- It was a gift.
- It's human rib bones.

09:19.703 --> 09:20.623
Frank's back.

09:20.633 --> 09:24.683
If this is who we think it is, he took
the rib bones as gifts to give to Jane.

09:24.693 --> 09:27.183
And yet this one he
gave back to Sarah. Why?

09:27.193 --> 09:31.113
It's not for Sarah,it's
for us. It's a message.

09:35.133 --> 09:37.593
What is that?

09:41.013 --> 09:43.053
We need to tell the
police what we found.

09:43.063 --> 09:44.773
- Wait.
- For what?

09:44.783 --> 09:48.303
If we know anything about Frank, he wouldn't
have left a trace of his DNA in here.

09:48.313 --> 09:52.663
There are a number of ways this scene could be
interpreted, and all of them could indicate Gideon.

09:52.673 --> 09:55.703
As long as Frank's out there, we can't
afford to stop and explain any of it.

09:55.713 --> 09:57.853
Last time he did all of this for Jane.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.943
Well, things seem to
have changed dramatically.

09:59.953 --> 10:03.103
Maybe she's dead. They had a
lovers' quarrel and he killed her?

10:03.113 --> 10:05.743
If he came here looking for
Gideon, maybe he found him.

10:05.753 --> 10:09.213
Let's go find out where Gideon went.

10:16.573 --> 10:18.173
Hello?

10:19.523 --> 10:21.263
Hello? Who is this?

10:21.273 --> 10:23.183
- I nearly had him.
- Where are you?

10:23.193 --> 10:26.933
I saw him walking off down the
street. He was just- just walking.

10:26.943 --> 10:29.643
He dropped something in
the trash out in the street.

10:29.653 --> 10:32.813
I couldn't get a clean shot.
The streets were too crowded.

10:32.823 --> 10:35.103
- Was Jane with him?
- No.

10:35.113 --> 10:37.853
But I saw her when I was talking to you.

10:37.863 --> 10:41.353
I saw her in the street
seconds before he called me.

10:41.363 --> 10:44.323
- He called you?
- He came after me. He came to my home.

10:44.333 --> 10:49.013
Then he's out of his comfort zone,in a big
city with feds who know what he looks like.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.523
It's my fault. It's me he wanted.

10:51.533 --> 10:55.763
And if I hadn't been
late...she'd still be alive.

10:56.243 --> 10:57.693
He butchered her, Hotch.

10:57.703 --> 10:59.813
- Jason...
- I'm coming in.

10:59.823 --> 11:04.353
No. Do that and this investigation
moves inside an interrogation room.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.593
And by the time the cops catch up, we're
going to be looking at more dead bodies.

11:07.603 --> 11:11.423
- Right.
- He's going to change who he goes after. He has to.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.863
- I know.
- We know who Frank is.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.893
We don't know the why.

11:15.903 --> 11:19.983
You help us find out the
why and we'll catch him.

11:20.703 --> 11:22.483
For that I'm going to need my files.

11:22.493 --> 11:25.093
I'll have Garcia bring them to you.

11:25.103 --> 11:27.893
You find some place
quiet where you can work.

11:27.903 --> 11:31.093
And, Jason...

11:31.103 --> 11:33.323
we'll get him.

11:38.383 --> 11:40.453
Frank had to have come out
the same way down this street.

11:40.463 --> 11:42.203
If they saw Gideon, they saw Frank.

11:42.213 --> 11:45.713
Well, we know Frank will do whatever
it takes to blend in and not stand out.

11:45.723 --> 11:49.003
Well, to avoid attracting attention, he would
have simply walked calmly out of that crime scene.

11:49.013 --> 11:51.093
The evisceration of Sarah, though, means
he would have been soaked in her blood.

11:51.103 --> 11:52.843
No, he had access to Gideon's closet.

11:52.853 --> 11:54.903
He cleans up, gets a
change of clothes, he's out.

11:54.913 --> 11:56.753
Yet he left no trace of
evidence at the crime scene.

11:56.763 --> 12:00.143
- Gideon said he dumped it en route.
- You spoke with Gideon?

12:00.153 --> 12:02.283
- Where is he, Hotch?
- He's safe.

12:02.293 --> 12:05.273
Well, that's all the proof we need, right?
We can turn him over to the M.P.D now.

12:05.283 --> 12:07.523
By the time this comes back
from the lab, Frank's long gone.

12:07.533 --> 12:10.033
If the cops find out we're hiding
evidence and a material witness from them-

12:10.043 --> 12:13.213
We're not hiding evidence. We'll give
this to forensics, let them search for DNA.

12:13.223 --> 12:15.483
We'll look for Frank.

12:16.253 --> 12:18.133
- Agent Morgan?
- What the hell?

12:18.143 --> 12:20.943
They say beauty can
cover a multitude of sins.

12:20.953 --> 12:22.573
- What?
- But underneath it all...

12:22.583 --> 12:26.773
we all look exactly the same.

12:27.263 --> 12:29.593
That's Frank. He said
that to me in the diner.

12:29.603 --> 12:33.033
Give me Jane or I'll kill them all.

12:33.743 --> 12:35.923
- Frank thinks we have Jane?
- We need to find her fast.

12:35.933 --> 12:38.773
Can I have my 10 bucks now?

12:51.311 --> 12:54.411
Nervous whistles, stop it.
Stop it, Everything is...

12:54.421 --> 12:57.091
Everything cool, Garcia.

12:58.551 --> 13:02.231
Gorgeous tech kitten found in lonely...

13:02.241 --> 13:05.051
dark parking lot.

13:05.061 --> 13:07.511
Throat slashed, ear to ear.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.801
Horrific. Tragic.

13:10.811 --> 13:17.541
With the very files of one of the
most prolific serial killers ever.

13:17.551 --> 13:20.851
Tonight he remains at large,
the blood of Quantico's finest-

13:20.861 --> 13:22.441
Oh, god! Oh, my god!

13:22.451 --> 13:24.931
- Drive.
- Right. Drive, yes, drive. Drive where?

13:24.941 --> 13:27.501
- Just drive.
- Just drive, just drive.

13:32.391 --> 13:36.371
Gideon saw Jane just before Frank called
him. If we find Jane, we'll find Frank.

13:36.381 --> 13:38.321
Last time we found
Frank, he outsmarted us.

13:38.331 --> 13:41.431
He took a busload of children
hostage. He gave us no options.

13:41.441 --> 13:42.961
He's not going to give us any now.

13:42.971 --> 13:47.081
Frank's message- he said, I'll
kill them all. Who's he referring to?

13:54.201 --> 13:58.851
- J.J.? - Hey, uh, Gideon had a
book, a black leather-bound book.

13:58.861 --> 14:02.461
Garcia discovered something. It looks
like the first page has been ripped out.

14:02.471 --> 14:07.651
You can only really see what's left on the side of
the page, but it's definitely Gideon's handwriting.

14:07.661 --> 14:10.481
- Looks like some kind of a list.
- It's his murder book.

14:10.491 --> 14:11.541
Murder book?

14:11.551 --> 14:15.541
When he opens it to the first page, it
reminds him why he does what he does.

14:15.551 --> 14:19.631
It's a list of all the people he's ever
saved. Names, dates, personal details.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.241
And now Frank has the list.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.941
Frank said,"I'll kill them all.
"That's who he's going after.

14:23.951 --> 14:26.091
Yeah,at least the ones he can
get to, the ones that are nearby.

14:26.101 --> 14:28.381
J.J., start locating
all the possible targets.

14:28.391 --> 14:30.011
- We need to call them and warn them.
- Got it

14:30.021 --> 14:31.641
- Do we tell Gideon?
- Absolutely not.

14:31.651 --> 14:34.551
We need to find out who Frank is first.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.901
The Smithsinian
Institute WASHINGTON, D.C

14:58.011 --> 15:02.271
I'm sorry for your loss, Jason. Truly.

15:03.651 --> 15:07.121
Thank you very much for doing
this. You're a good friend.

15:07.131 --> 15:12.031
Security knows you're
here. Take care of him.

15:15.401 --> 15:18.781
I grabbed everything I could
find pertaining to the case.

15:22.891 --> 15:26.781
Turdus polyglottus. Mockingbird.

15:26.791 --> 15:31.271
They've provided insights
into the origin of syntax.

15:31.281 --> 15:36.971
Essential first steps into the
evolution of human language.

15:38.331 --> 15:44.141
If we stand any chance of stopping him, we
need to understand the evolution of Frank.

15:45.991 --> 15:48.541
What created him.

15:55.991 --> 15:58.171
- Took these from Gideon's office.
- What about Jane?

15:58.181 --> 16:02.261
I gave photos of Jane and Frank to all media
outlets, and I'm liaising with Washington M.P.D.

16:02.271 --> 16:05.831
J.J., if you locate her, make sure we're the first
to interrogate her. Don't let P.D. get to her.

16:05.841 --> 16:07.441
- Is that wise?
- No, but it is an order.

16:07.451 --> 16:11.201
Whatever you do, bring her here first.
She's the only one who knows who Frank is.

16:11.211 --> 16:13.491
So far we've narrowed it
down to 9 possible targets.

16:13.501 --> 16:16.101
Their contact details are in the
files. Everybody grab a phone.

16:16.111 --> 16:18.241
Let's start calling.

16:21.321 --> 16:23.901
5 sugars.

16:25.821 --> 16:28.461
I have a sweet tooth.

16:28.471 --> 16:32.501
Thank you for coming, but
it really wasn't necessary.

16:32.881 --> 16:35.921
We at the B.A.U like to
follow up on our victims.

16:35.931 --> 16:37.901
She's in the basement downstairs!

16:38.341 --> 16:39.701
Is the house on fire?

16:39.711 --> 16:41.421
- Rebecca!
- Get me out of here.

16:41.431 --> 16:43.111
Hurry!

16:43.321 --> 16:45.651
Let's go, we've got no time.

16:49.451 --> 16:51.631
I try not to think
of myself as a victim.

16:51.641 --> 16:55.711
That's good. Very healthy.

16:55.721 --> 16:59.121
A sound strategy.

17:02.601 --> 17:04.601
Oh, my, this is perfect.

17:04.611 --> 17:07.751
I am glad to get a chance
to personally thank you.

17:07.761 --> 17:13.121
You wrote me this lovely
letter. I keep it at home.

17:13.131 --> 17:17.851
You were t only member of the team I didn't
get a chance to meet face to face, agent Gideon.

17:17.861 --> 17:21.171
Please, call me Jason.

17:22.631 --> 17:25.701
Did you know recent studies into
female rape victims found that

17:25.711 --> 17:29.741
a high proportion of them
later in life are raped again?

17:29.751 --> 17:30.981
No, I wasn't raped.

17:30.991 --> 17:34.251
It's almost as if they
emit a kind of...signal.

17:34.261 --> 17:38.191
- But I wasn't raped.
- But you are on a list.

17:38.201 --> 17:41.881
- A list?
- A list of lives saved.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.881
How were you saved, Rebecca?

17:44.891 --> 17:47.351
What happened to you?

17:47.361 --> 17:48.661
What happened?

17:48.671 --> 17:52.471
Your letter was so...nonspecific.

17:52.481 --> 17:55.321
- But don't you-
- Were you afraid?

17:56.621 --> 17:59.271
I've never felt the feeling of fear.

17:59.281 --> 18:03.381
Apparently I'm...incapable.

18:05.521 --> 18:08.211
Tell me, Rebecca.

18:08.221 --> 18:12.171
What's it feel
like- fear?

18:15.721 --> 18:18.311
I should get that.

18:19.821 --> 18:22.651
Saved by the bell.

18:23.631 --> 18:25.721
- Hello?
- Rebecca Brian?

18:25.731 --> 18:28.421
Hi, this is Jennifer
Jareau with the FBI.

18:28.431 --> 18:31.391
He's not agent Gideon, is he?

18:31.401 --> 18:32.921
Excuse me?

18:32.931 --> 18:34.471
Rebecca, this is agent Hotchner.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.851
If you can, very calmly excuse
yourself and get out of the house.

18:37.861 --> 18:40.391
Can you do that?

18:40.401 --> 18:45.381
Rebecca, just calmly hang up,
walk to your door, and leave.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.621
Ok? Rebecca?

18:47.631 --> 18:51.151
- What's going on?
- Rebecca...

18:53.261 --> 18:55.501
Rebecca?

18:57.511 --> 18:59.031
Rebecca?

18:59.041 --> 19:04.811
Hi, I regret to inform you that Rebecca's
name should be moved to a new list.

19:05.171 --> 19:08.501
Frank,we don't have
her.We do not have Jane.

19:08.511 --> 19:12.321
I will not stop until I have her back.

19:12.331 --> 19:15.421
Frank...Frank!

19:31.542 --> 19:33.302
FBI!

19:35.852 --> 19:37.902
- Clear.
- Clear.

20:03.202 --> 20:07.222
Hotch...nothing could have stopped this.

20:09.452 --> 20:11.422
Guys...

20:13.222 --> 20:17.852
we've got a note from
Frank. 7 A.M. Union Station.

20:17.862 --> 20:20.872
All 8 other targets on that
list are safe and accounted for.

20:20.882 --> 20:23.542
Then we've missed someone or
something. Now that he's set a meeting-

20:23.552 --> 20:27.502
He's going to raise the stakes.
Just like he did last time.

20:27.512 --> 20:31.512
He's going to make it impossible for us
to not trade Jane for whoever he's got.

20:35.202 --> 20:37.162
- Yeah, J.J?
- I think I found Jane.

20:37.172 --> 20:41.322
The beat cops picked up a woman who was ranting
and raving about needing to talk to the B.A.U.

20:41.332 --> 20:45.062
She, uh, assaulted one of the police
officers. She's being processed as we speak.

20:45.072 --> 20:46.732
So what have we missed?

20:46.742 --> 20:50.122
Frank's incapable of
experiencing normal feelings.

20:50.132 --> 20:53.572
- Yeah, but he takes what normal people hold sacred.
- Children.

20:53.582 --> 20:56.372
J.J., I'm going to have Prentiss call
you to find out where to pick up Jane.

20:56.382 --> 20:59.752
We'll all meet back at the B.A.U. I'm
going to wait for the crime scene unit.

20:59.762 --> 21:02.792
I heard you. He's going
after children now.

21:02.802 --> 21:06.272
I also need you to look at relocations,
anything involving children.

21:06.282 --> 21:09.382
Families that have moved into
the D.C. area since the case.

21:09.392 --> 21:11.182
I'm on it.

21:20.392 --> 21:23.662
This is hopeless. We don't
even know Frank's surname.

21:23.672 --> 21:27.232
But we do know the only person
ever to survive abduction by Frank.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.132
Jane. He fell in love with her.

21:29.142 --> 21:33.722
Oh, he was a psychopath. He's incapable
of emotionally bonding with anyone.

21:33.732 --> 21:36.762
Yet he was prepared to
risk everything to have her.

21:36.772 --> 21:39.252
Amongst all those he killed
there has to be one constant

21:39.262 --> 21:43.612
One repetitious act,
a break from pattern.

21:44.172 --> 21:47.042
One he's probably not even aware of.

21:51.422 --> 21:54.432
If they don't come soon,
somebody's going to get hurt!

21:54.442 --> 21:56.932
If you don't shut the
hell up, you'll get hurt.

21:56.942 --> 22:00.112
I would like to leave now!
I don't want to be here.

22:00.122 --> 22:03.042
Hello? Hello? Excuse me!

22:03.052 --> 22:06.862
- Bitch, shut it.
- Please, I don't want to be in here!

22:06.872 --> 22:09.382
Shut the hell up or I'll do it for you.

22:09.392 --> 22:13.132
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Hey, knock it off! Jane.

22:13.922 --> 22:16.652
- Come in here and get this mouthy bitch out of here.
- Back off!

22:16.662 --> 22:19.752
- Agent Prentiss, FBI.
- Fbi?

22:19.762 --> 22:23.262
Do you remember me? From Nevada?

22:24.392 --> 22:27.552
- I asked for agent Gideon.
- We know.

22:27.562 --> 22:29.602
We'll bring you to him.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.162
I told you!

22:36.602 --> 22:38.712
Agent Gideon's right, you know.

22:38.722 --> 22:41.612
Frank, he can't feel love.

22:41.622 --> 22:45.542
He wants to, but he can't.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.512
He's coming for me, you know?

22:48.522 --> 22:51.222
He's already here.

23:06.092 --> 23:08.222
Tracey Belle.

23:10.902 --> 23:11.832
Hotchner.

23:11.842 --> 23:16.402
Hotch, Tracey Belle and her family
relocated to McLean, Virginia, 8 months ago.

23:16.412 --> 23:20.962
It-it's her, Hotch. She's the
only one who's unaccounted for.

23:20.972 --> 23:23.562
Belle Residence McLEAN,VIRGINIA

23:38.462 --> 23:39.732
FBI!

23:41.242 --> 23:43.382
Get the unit crime scene team.

23:47.302 --> 23:47.962
That's my house.

23:47.972 --> 23:49.292
- Mr. Belle?
- You have to let us in.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.002
- My daughter's in there.
- You can't go in right now.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.202
Where's Tracey? Where is she?

23:52.212 --> 23:54.742
What's important to know right
now is Tracey is alive, ok?

23:54.752 --> 23:58.532
- Your daughter's alive- - Sir-sir!
She's not in there. She's not in there.

23:58.542 --> 24:01.972
I promise you we will find
her, and she's going to be fine.

24:01.982 --> 24:05.162
- No, no, no...
- It's ok.

24:05.172 --> 24:09.482
No, no, no. No...

24:28.212 --> 24:30.762
Did I do the right thing by coming here?

24:30.772 --> 24:33.072
Yes, you did the right thing.

24:33.082 --> 24:35.692
Please, sit down.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.842
Is that my bag?

24:43.992 --> 24:47.082
- Tell us something good, Reid.
- We have Jane.

24:47.092 --> 24:50.312
- That's good news.
- Not entirely.

24:51.822 --> 24:54.212
Frank hasn't hurt anyone, has he?

24:54.222 --> 24:56.062
He wouldn't do that.

24:56.072 --> 24:58.212
Not while he has me.

24:58.222 --> 25:02.162
He doesn't have you. We do.

25:05.002 --> 25:08.982
- He came after agent Gideon.
- Why did you leave Frank?

25:08.992 --> 25:12.122
What...changed?

25:16.032 --> 25:20.552
He did. Frank changed.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.902
He changed just like agent Gideon said.

25:23.912 --> 25:29.492
And he was so angry with agent Gideon because
he knows Frank better than anyone else.

25:29.502 --> 25:31.362
And Frank knows that, too.

25:31.372 --> 25:34.542
Frank wants agent Gideon
to stop him, doesn't he?

25:34.552 --> 25:37.782
Well, if anyone can, agent Gideon can.

25:37.792 --> 25:44.032
- Not without you, Jane.
- What do you mean?

25:44.042 --> 25:48.822
Considering the 3 factors of determined
behavior- bio, psycho, social...

25:48.832 --> 25:51.292
- Sir- -
First, biology.

25:51.302 --> 25:55.742
Genetics gave him the predisposition.
Add to that the second factor, psychology.

25:55.752 --> 25:57.682
- Clearly a psychopath.
- Ok.

25:57.692 --> 26:00.382
That's the filter through which
he experiences his environment.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.622
Finally, socialization-
life experiences.

26:03.632 --> 26:06.582
Like all of us, he's a
complicated manifestation of all 3.

26:06.592 --> 26:09.662
So you put that all together and...

26:10.072 --> 26:12.122
think of Frank as a
living murder weapon.

26:12.132 --> 26:18.292
His genetics load the gun, his psychology
aims it, the environment pulls the trigger.

26:19.142 --> 26:23.312
That's why his victims are
so important. We study them.

26:23.722 --> 26:27.092
- They reflect back on him.
- Ok. He killed mostly women.

26:27.102 --> 26:30.852
Since he used a trailer, their occupations,
locations, and ages are all over the place.

26:30.862 --> 26:33.742
Plot out the ages.

26:33.752 --> 26:40.512
Um, he killed 43 in their 50s, 51 in their
40s, 64 in their 30s, and 12 in their 20s.

26:40.522 --> 26:44.252
- 12?
- Is that odd?

26:44.262 --> 26:48.222
Precedent tells us the number of
victims should rise as the age falls.

26:49.222 --> 26:50.892
So it's a break from pattern. Why?

26:50.902 --> 26:52.562
He wasn't attracted to them.

26:52.572 --> 26:54.852
No, that doesn't make any sense because
he doesn't feel attraction or love.

26:54.862 --> 26:58.752
No, no, no, no. You're onto something.

26:59.282 --> 27:01.062
That's great, I don't know what.

27:01.072 --> 27:04.812
- Who was the only victim he didn't kill?
- Jane.

27:05.412 --> 27:07.642
She was 22 when Frank
first abducted her.

27:07.652 --> 27:10.312
And through the years
he kept on coming back.

27:10.322 --> 27:15.722
Kept visiting her, bringing her
gifts, making sure she was ok.

27:16.922 --> 27:19.922
Mother protects her children.

27:19.932 --> 27:22.042
In Frank's case, it was vice versa.

27:22.052 --> 27:25.522
He didn't kill Jane because
he sees her as his mother.

27:25.532 --> 27:28.302
Tell me about Frank. Where's he from?

27:34.632 --> 27:37.492
- Manhattan.
- Manhattan? You sure?

27:37.502 --> 27:39.592
Yes, I'm sure!

27:39.602 --> 27:41.452
He talked about it all the time.

27:41.462 --> 27:44.562
He told me where he lived and
how he grew up, everything.

27:44.572 --> 27:46.422
He wanted me to know everything.

27:46.432 --> 27:50.322
Did he ever say where in Manhattan?

27:51.032 --> 27:54.222
He lived with his
mother. She was german.

27:54.232 --> 27:58.072
Breitkopf. Mary Breitkopf.

27:58.082 --> 28:01.182
And Frank never knew his father.

28:01.192 --> 28:04.342
So he uses his mother's name?

28:05.272 --> 28:09.352
And she would take him every sunday

28:09.362 --> 28:12.392
to the fair on Long Island.

28:12.402 --> 28:14.952
He talked about her constantly.

28:14.962 --> 28:18.892
And they would have dinner parties,
and-and Frank would dress up,

28:18.902 --> 28:22.902
and he would be the barman, and
he would serve all the guests...

28:22.912 --> 28:25.342
cocktails.

28:26.542 --> 28:30.022
Jane, when you were with Frank,
did he ever hurt anyone else?

28:34.532 --> 28:39.542
Being on the run can be
very romantic, you know.

28:40.072 --> 28:43.182
Did Frank try to kill anyone else?

28:47.822 --> 28:52.022
- Is it wrong?
- Is what wrong?

28:52.032 --> 28:54.952
Loving Frank?

28:54.962 --> 28:59.372
Uh, you don't choose who
you fall in love with.

29:00.992 --> 29:05.152
Maybe you thought you could change
him. And you did, too, for a time.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.222
Yes.

29:06.232 --> 29:10.102
Until the desire to kill overwhelmed
him. And you saw that, didn't you, Jane?

29:10.112 --> 29:13.772
- You saw it in him.
- Yes.

29:14.142 --> 29:17.252
Who did he try to kill?

29:18.562 --> 29:20.222
Me.

29:20.232 --> 29:24.622
But he stopped himself.
We had an argument...

29:25.632 --> 29:29.722
and I screamed at him, and
I said that Gideon was right

29:29.732 --> 29:32.652
and he became so angry.

29:33.392 --> 29:36.072
And I had to run here.

29:36.082 --> 29:39.512
But as long as he's trying to
find me, he won't kill again.

29:39.522 --> 29:41.422
He has already.

29:41.432 --> 29:44.162
And he's not going to stop
until he gets you back.

29:44.172 --> 29:47.812
- Oh- -
I'm sorry.

29:53.842 --> 29:56.262
Got it. Thanks, Hotch.

29:56.272 --> 29:59.072
Mother's name is Mary
Breitkopf from Manhattan.

29:59.082 --> 30:00.932
Wait.

30:01.482 --> 30:03.542
The diner.

30:04.692 --> 30:09.002
Adam and Eve on a raft, sink 'em, and a
strawberry shake for the gentleman at table 8.

30:09.012 --> 30:13.392
Ah, finally, you walk into my life.
What took you so long, handsome?

30:13.402 --> 30:14.532
Honey?

30:16.952 --> 30:20.662
- Mind if I sit here?
- Please.

30:20.672 --> 30:22.392
He was obsessed with facts.

30:22.402 --> 30:28.232
Recent record lows have sent desert floor
temperatures plummeting into single digits.

30:28.752 --> 30:31.482
He said something about Manhattan.

30:31.492 --> 30:35.552
1,5 million people inhabit Manhattan.

30:35.562 --> 30:38.102
Did you know that?

30:38.112 --> 30:42.832
- I read about a woman whose body was found
- In her apartment, upper east side.

30:46.642 --> 30:50.002
That was the only thing he said
that genuinely seemed to move him.

30:51.372 --> 30:54.772
- He was talking about his mother.
- Mary Breitkopf.

30:56.632 --> 30:58.822
He said his parents named him Frank.

30:58.832 --> 31:03.052
- I'm Frank. Germanic, third century...
- third century.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.742
Derived from the name
of a type of spear.

31:06.752 --> 31:10.902
- I wonder what aspirations...
- my parents had for me.

31:12.212 --> 31:15.672
German mother, probably immigrated
to this country in the fifties.

31:15.682 --> 31:17.272
If he likens Jane to his mother...

31:17.282 --> 31:21.312
then she must have been in her late
teens when she arrived in Manhattan.

31:21.322 --> 31:26.352
I've got 3 Mary Breitkopfs living in upper
east side during the fifties and sixties.

31:26.362 --> 31:29.032
- Jane said she was a lawyer.
- No lawyers here.

31:29.042 --> 31:33.362
A 52-year-old Mary Louise
Breitkopf. She died of cancer, 1973.

31:33.372 --> 31:36.272
Tailor's assistant.
Mary Breitkopf, nurse.

31:36.282 --> 31:39.102
Killed in a traffic
accident. Mary Breitkopf...

31:39.802 --> 31:40.612
What?

31:40.622 --> 31:43.782
This Mary Breitkopf
was arrested...63 times.

31:43.792 --> 31:46.562
- What for?
- Solicitation. She was a hooker.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.742
- Is she deceased?
- Uh, no. No death certificate.

31:49.752 --> 31:51.832
Uh, she's alive and living in Manhattan.

31:51.842 --> 31:55.092
Search for a story involving a woman found
dead in her apartment- dead for over a year.

31:55.102 --> 31:57.832
- Upper east side, Manhattan.
- Zip. Nothing.

31:57.842 --> 32:00.312
So it never happened.

32:00.662 --> 32:03.602
Frank's been hiding her
existence from everyone.

32:04.612 --> 32:06.102
Why?

32:06.112 --> 32:07.162
Yeah?

32:07.172 --> 32:10.662
Garcia, get me Jason. I have
someone who wants to talk to him.

32:11.242 --> 32:13.222
It's for you.

32:15.222 --> 32:17.472
- Yeah?
- Jason?

32:17.482 --> 32:19.982
- Who's this?
- It's Tracey Belle.

32:19.992 --> 32:22.772
Go ahead, Tracey. It's ok.

32:22.782 --> 32:27.272
Please, mr. Gideon...you saved me once.

32:27.282 --> 32:29.732
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I remember you.

32:29.742 --> 32:33.052
How could I ever forget you?

32:33.062 --> 32:37.162
Tracey, everything's
going to be all right.

32:37.882 --> 32:41.392
Please, I'm scared.
I just want my mommy.

32:41.772 --> 32:45.952
Please. Please!

32:48.602 --> 32:51.262
- Jason.
- You son of a bitch.

32:51.272 --> 32:55.232
I swear to you I will find
you and I will stop you.

32:56.372 --> 32:58.052
Jason.

32:58.062 --> 33:02.042
I chose e station because I
know how much you love trains.

33:02.052 --> 33:05.662
I saw the toys in your apartment.

33:07.402 --> 33:12.482
I- I can't trace that call. It wasn't long enough,
and even if it was, I-I can't triangulate it

33:13.902 --> 33:18.642
um, what do you want me to do? Talk
to me, please. Tell me what I can-

33:18.652 --> 33:22.372
Call Hotch. Read that to
him. He'll know what to do.

33:26.052 --> 33:29.262
- What are you going to do?
- End this.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.757
Anybody got eyes on the target?

34:08.637 --> 34:10.516
Nothing.

34:12.667 --> 34:15.407
Did Gideon say where he was going?

34:15.417 --> 34:17.226
He'll be here.

34:17.237 --> 34:21.237
- In what capacity?
- What's that supposed to mean?

34:21.246 --> 34:24.187
As an agent or an executioner?

34:24.197 --> 34:28.067
12 o'clock. Platform 11.
Target. Target east side.

34:28.077 --> 34:31.266
I have eyes on the target,
and I have a clear shot. Over.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.317
We're about to find out.

34:37.067 --> 34:41.187
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your
fire. There are civilians on the platform.

34:41.197 --> 34:45.617
Let's go! Go! Back, all of you
back off! We need you out of here!

34:45.627 --> 34:47.627
2087 E. 78th St, UPPER EAST SIDE,
MANHATTAN It's right this way.

34:48.397 --> 34:50.187
Whoa, hey.

34:50.197 --> 34:53.257
No matter what happens this
time, we don't split up, clear?

34:53.266 --> 34:55.456
Crystal clear.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.197
Frank.

35:00.207 --> 35:05.577
Agent Hotchner, we haven't had
the pleasure of a formal meeting.

35:05.587 --> 35:08.057
Where's Tracey Belle?

35:08.067 --> 35:11.377
Do you have something for me?

35:12.197 --> 35:14.657
No, I don't.

35:15.167 --> 35:18.197
Then you'll never see her again.

35:21.737 --> 35:25.237
Go ahead and bring her in.

35:34.057 --> 35:37.417
- Jane.
- Where's Tracey, Frank?

35:41.557 --> 35:44.307
- Wait here.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:47.067 --> 35:50.127
Did you think I wouldn't
come looking for you?

35:50.137 --> 35:52.657
You killed 2 innocent women.

35:52.667 --> 35:55.567
Without you, I am lost.

35:55.577 --> 35:57.367
Tracey, Frank.

35:57.377 --> 35:59.367
Not until we're safely away.

35:59.377 --> 36:03.327
Stop it, Frank. I'm not coming.

36:03.337 --> 36:06.287
It's you and
me- forever.

36:06.297 --> 36:08.217
I can't go with you.

36:08.227 --> 36:13.407
I will never be taken by these...people.

36:13.417 --> 36:18.027
And without you, I
will not stop, not ever.

36:20.327 --> 36:22.757
Sarah was a doctor.

36:22.767 --> 36:25.437
- She was a mother of 3 boys.
- Hello, Jason.

36:25.447 --> 36:29.807
She worked and ran a treatment center
for patients with terminal cancer.

36:29.817 --> 36:32.057
Do you know the birder's
term "twitching," Jason?

36:32.067 --> 36:35.967
She dedicated her life to
easing the pain of others.

36:35.977 --> 36:39.057
The pursuit of a previously
located rare bird.

36:39.067 --> 36:42.237
You took the lives of hundreds.

36:43.117 --> 36:45.547
All because your mother was a whore?

36:45.557 --> 36:49.667
Mary Louise Breitkopf, single
mother, german immigrant

36:49.677 --> 36:51.737
lived on the upper
east side of Manhattan.

36:51.747 --> 36:57.907
She gave birth to her only son, Frank
Breitkopf, a bright but ultimately strange boy.

36:58.557 --> 37:01.367
A boy that only a mother could love.

37:01.377 --> 37:06.777
His needs were such that even the 3 jobs she
worked didn't provide for this special child.

37:07.137 --> 37:10.507
A child she would not
let out near the world

37:10.517 --> 37:13.817
and When she turned to the
worlds oldest profession

37:13.827 --> 37:17.337
and the boy witnessed every
single terrible visitation.

37:20.017 --> 37:22.607
You're not a rare bird, Frank.

37:22.617 --> 37:25.017
Nothing special about you.

37:25.487 --> 37:29.347
You're common, pedestrian...boring.

37:30.217 --> 37:35.097
Jane. This world, we don't fit in it.

37:35.107 --> 37:37.027
No one understands what we are.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.347
Jane, he sees you as his mother.

37:39.357 --> 37:40.977
Nothing more, nothing less.

37:40.987 --> 37:44.557
Have you ever been happier
than when you've been with me?

37:45.137 --> 37:47.177
Never.

37:47.187 --> 37:50.297
- Didn't we have fun?
- Jane!

37:50.307 --> 37:53.387
- So much!
- Come with me now.

37:53.397 --> 37:55.757
It doesn't have to end here.

38:00.757 --> 38:01.667
Jane!

38:01.677 --> 38:04.997
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

38:07.487 --> 38:10.047
Jane, Jane! Jane!

38:17.657 --> 38:19.937
Hang on a second. I'm walking to him.

38:19.947 --> 38:23.297
Just one second. Here he is.

38:23.307 --> 38:25.077
It's for you.

38:26.577 --> 38:30.467
- Hello?
- Agent Gideon?

38:30.477 --> 38:34.867
- Tracey.
- I just wanted to call and thank you.

38:34.877 --> 38:38.417
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:00.017 --> 39:04.307
Once again the team had
battled a monster and won.

39:04.317 --> 39:07.597
The future of the B.A.U.
is not in the balance here.

39:07.607 --> 39:11.757
The residual impact as a result of
the investigations into the crimes

39:11.767 --> 39:14.697
and criminals you pursue is.

39:14.707 --> 39:17.637
Every cause has its effect.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.327
You think I don't know that?

39:19.337 --> 39:23.517
I believe you are no longer
effective in your post.

39:29.027 --> 39:32.807
The modern furniture, the strategically
placed magazines, the framed diplomas

39:32.817 --> 39:35.957
the art on the wall, are all in
conflict with your family photos.

39:35.967 --> 39:38.207
You have 3 children, but you
favor the middle one, your son.

39:38.217 --> 39:40.197
- What do you think you're doing?
- Of course you love all your children

39:40.207 --> 39:41.927
- but not like your son.
- That's enough.

39:41.937 --> 39:45.727
The bonsai you obsessively nurture is to
compensate for feelings of failure as a mother.

39:45.737 --> 39:48.247
Agent Hotchner, I said that is enough.

39:48.257 --> 39:50.657
My position is not in question here.

39:50.667 --> 39:55.057
As your superior, I am questioning
your ability to lead your team.

39:55.067 --> 39:57.457
My team? Let me tell you about my team.

39:57.467 --> 40:01.977
Agent Morgan fought to protect his identity
from the very people who could save him- why?

40:01.987 --> 40:06.267
Because trust has to be earned, and
there are very few people he truly trusts.

40:06.277 --> 40:09.127
Reid's intellect is a shield which
protects him from his emotions

40:09.137 --> 40:11.607
and at the moment his
shield is under repair.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.487
Prentiss overcompensates because she
doesn't yet feel she's a part of the team.

40:14.497 --> 40:15.847
She needn't worry.

40:15.857 --> 40:19.387
Every day, agent Jareau fields
dozens of requests for our team.

40:19.397 --> 40:22.447
And every night she goes home
hoping she's made the right choices.

40:22.457 --> 40:27.597
Garcia fills her office with figurines and color to
remind herself to smile as the horrofills her screens.

40:27.607 --> 40:33.887
And agent Gideon, in many ways, is damned
by his profound knowledge of others.

40:33.897 --> 40:38.867
Which is why he shares so little of himself,
yet he pours his heart into every case we handle.

40:50.097 --> 40:52.247
I stand by my actions,
and I stand by my team.

40:52.257 --> 40:57.947
And if you think that you can find a
better person for the job, good luck.

40:59.487 --> 41:01.737
Agent Hotchner.

41:04.407 --> 41:07.817
How do I know you favor your son?

41:11.057 --> 41:14.417
I'm good at my job.

42:08.837 --> 42:12.327
I put you in the B.A.U. I
knew how badly you wanted it.

42:12.337 --> 42:14.057
Everyone did.

42:14.067 --> 42:17.457
You were never exactly
shy about letting us know.

42:17.467 --> 42:22.337
But there were those who didn't think
assigning you to the B.A.U was a good idea.

42:22.347 --> 42:25.167
They thought you were too reckless.

42:25.177 --> 42:28.227
I believed in you, however.

42:28.727 --> 42:32.617
It's time to pay back the faith I had.

42:32.627 --> 42:35.667
Your team is in trouble.

42:36.377 --> 42:37.977
They've lost sight of the big picture.

42:37.987 --> 42:42.337
I believe they are reckless
and at times out of control.

42:45.707 --> 42:49.697
It's time for agent Hotchner's
career to come to an end.

42:50.897 --> 42:55.897
And if you want to stay in
the B.A.U. agent Prentiss

42:57.247 --> 42:59.887
you're going to help
me make that happen.
