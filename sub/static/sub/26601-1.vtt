01:33.058 --> 01:34.715
- Do you wanna watch another?

01:34.715 --> 01:37.545
- I honestly feel like
we've seen everything.

01:37.545 --> 01:38.753
- We haven't seen everything.

01:38.753 --> 01:42.447
- Seriously, the entire
catalog run through.

01:42.447 --> 01:43.758
Netflix, we're done with.

01:45.070 --> 01:47.141
I'm on that verge of
going, let's chill.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.730
- No.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.041
- Yeah.
- No.

01:51.041 --> 01:52.319
- Yeah.

01:52.319 --> 01:54.666
We literally have
nothing else to watch.

01:54.666 --> 01:56.599
- We could watch one more.

01:56.599 --> 01:58.911
- If you say Bee
Movie, I swear to God.

02:00.810 --> 02:01.673
You're doing it again.

02:06.091 --> 02:07.161
Did you hear that?

02:08.507 --> 02:09.645
- Do you wanna?

02:09.645 --> 02:10.958
- I'll check it.

02:10.958 --> 02:11.993
- Yeah, you go check.

02:11.993 --> 02:14.341
- All right, I'll go check.

02:30.426 --> 02:31.772
- What does it say?

02:31.772 --> 02:32.876
- Tales of Hell.

02:34.499 --> 02:38.468
- No, I don't really
wanna watch a horror.

02:38.468 --> 02:39.676
- Come on, it could be good.

02:39.676 --> 02:42.369
- No, I don't think
it's the right sort of.

02:42.369 --> 02:43.473
- Seriously, how
often to you get,

02:43.473 --> 02:45.751
like, a tape come through.

02:45.751 --> 02:46.545
- I know, but.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.065
I dunno.

02:49.065 --> 02:50.411
- Let's do it.

02:50.411 --> 02:52.241
Just wanna have a look.

02:52.241 --> 02:53.173
- Okay, all right.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.277
All right fine.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.761
But, okay, fine.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.806
- All right, have a look.

03:09.292 --> 03:11.363
I know you're not in the
mood but it could be fun.

03:11.363 --> 03:12.192
- Okay.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.159
- Hello?

04:40.659 --> 04:41.488
Hello?

04:59.644 --> 05:00.438
Jesus!

05:02.371 --> 05:04.062
Get a grip, Miranda.

05:26.912 --> 05:27.741
Fuck!

05:42.272 --> 05:43.584
Come on, please!

05:50.384 --> 05:51.834
Is anybody there?

06:56.519 --> 06:58.832
- She's 24, 25, one of the
night managers, Caucasian.

06:58.832 --> 07:00.074
- I'm Detective Harris.

07:00.074 --> 07:01.317
- Detective Cordova,
nice to meet you, sir.

07:01.317 --> 07:02.422
- You first on the scene?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.284
- Yes.

07:03.284 --> 07:04.113
She's in here, sir.

07:04.113 --> 07:04.976
- All right.

07:04.976 --> 07:06.253
Call the coroner.

07:06.253 --> 07:07.703
- He's on his way.
- Okay.

07:13.778 --> 07:14.572
Ah geez.

07:16.643 --> 07:18.196
That's a shame.

07:18.196 --> 07:19.473
- You know her?

07:19.473 --> 07:20.336
- Yeah.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.408
Lauren Deakin.

07:26.825 --> 07:28.171
Just 24 years old.

07:30.277 --> 07:31.968
Works on human resources here.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.178
- How do you know all that?

07:35.178 --> 07:36.386
- I was here last night,

07:37.526 --> 07:39.459
following up on a
harassment case.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.633
- Wait, she was being harassed?

07:41.633 --> 07:44.705
- No, not her.

07:44.705 --> 07:47.156
Another employee, Stacey Newman.

07:47.156 --> 07:48.916
She just took the
original report.

07:49.779 --> 07:50.608
- Okay.

07:50.608 --> 07:51.471
- Nice girl.

07:52.610 --> 07:54.715
- What the hell
happened here then?

07:54.715 --> 07:55.544
- I don't know.

07:56.683 --> 07:58.616
She was here alone when I left.

07:58.616 --> 08:00.100
Manager locked up behind her.

08:01.308 --> 08:03.966
- So nobody could've
got in or out then?

08:03.966 --> 08:05.139
- Nobody except her.

08:06.071 --> 08:07.314
Heard the manager tell her

08:07.314 --> 08:08.833
to use her set of
keys when she left.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.664
Manager still here?

08:12.664 --> 08:14.355
- Yeah, she had your card on her

08:14.355 --> 08:16.185
that's how I knew who to call.

08:16.185 --> 08:17.704
She's in the office over there.

08:19.188 --> 08:20.120
Pretty shaken up.

08:31.407 --> 08:33.029
- I know it's not the best time

08:33.029 --> 08:35.653
but I need to ask you some
questions about last night.

08:37.378 --> 08:41.244
- I don't wanna talk
about last night.

08:41.244 --> 08:44.109
I mean, I don't understand.

08:44.109 --> 08:45.525
She was fine.

08:46.629 --> 08:48.976
I left her last night
and she was fine!

08:50.115 --> 08:51.220
- You couldn't have
know something like this

08:51.220 --> 08:52.670
was gonna happen.

08:52.670 --> 08:53.602
- But I should've.

08:55.017 --> 08:58.054
With everything that's
been going on around here,

08:58.054 --> 08:59.331
I should've known better.

09:02.058 --> 09:03.715
- She try to call
you last night?

09:05.786 --> 09:06.615
- I don't know.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.791
I couldn't get reception,
my phone was acting up.

09:13.138 --> 09:15.485
- No calls, no voicemail?

09:15.485 --> 09:17.936
- Like I said, my
phone wasn't working.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.042
- All right.

09:21.457 --> 09:23.079
Let's try to lock down
everybody's whereabouts

09:23.079 --> 09:23.873
from last night.

09:27.497 --> 09:28.637
I don't suppose anybody else

09:28.637 --> 09:30.431
might've been
working after hours?

09:30.431 --> 09:31.881
- After six on a Friday?

09:32.917 --> 09:33.745
Not likely.

09:34.746 --> 09:36.921
But, there are other departments

09:36.921 --> 09:40.925
and they have keys,
so, I can't be sure.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.894
- Can you give me a list of all
the employees who have keys?

09:46.033 --> 09:46.862
- I can try.

09:49.899 --> 09:53.351
- Can you think of anybody who
might've wanted to hurt her?

09:53.351 --> 09:57.217
Somebody new in her life,
a boyfriend, girlfriend?

09:57.217 --> 09:58.183
Anything like that?

09:58.183 --> 09:59.944
- Nobody she talked about.

09:59.944 --> 10:02.118
If she did I didn't know.

10:03.188 --> 10:04.017
- All right.

10:06.157 --> 10:09.574
What do you know about the
Stacey Newman harassment case?

10:09.574 --> 10:11.127
We're trying to track her down.

10:12.232 --> 10:13.613
- Not much, just...

10:15.511 --> 10:17.824
She claimed that somebody
was following her.

10:19.826 --> 10:20.758
- That's something.

10:22.173 --> 10:25.417
Thanks for answering
my questions.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.902
You have my card,

10:26.902 --> 10:28.973
if you need anything you
don't hesitate to call me.

10:30.491 --> 10:31.320
- Okay.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.494
Detective.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.496
- Hmm?

10:39.293 --> 10:40.087
- Nevermind.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.197
- I'd like to look at your
close circuit TV footage.

10:46.197 --> 10:47.405
Might be something there.

10:48.751 --> 10:49.614
- It's in the back.

10:49.614 --> 10:51.581
Take whatever you need.

10:51.581 --> 10:52.375
- Thanks.

11:32.933 --> 11:33.727
Thanks.

11:37.006 --> 11:38.698
Where are we on Stacey Newman?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.251
- Phone's been disconnected.

11:40.251 --> 11:41.770
Got the number of a
long distance relative

11:41.770 --> 11:43.116
but nothing to go on yet.

11:43.116 --> 11:44.704
- Keep trying, will ya?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.360
Hey, can you give me a
list of all the employees?

11:46.360 --> 11:47.499
- Yes, sir, will do.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.363
You heading out?

11:49.363 --> 11:50.157
- Yeah.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.286
- Harris.

14:33.286 --> 14:34.597
- You're not going
to believe this, detective.

14:34.597 --> 14:35.805
- What?

14:35.805 --> 14:37.014
- I sent a couple of
officers out to the dock

14:37.014 --> 14:39.602
for a secondary sweep, get this,

14:39.602 --> 14:40.914
we found another body.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.157
- Where?

14:42.157 --> 14:43.227
- Hidden in the
trash on the dock.

14:43.227 --> 14:44.918
The body's fresh.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.368
We're trying to ID the guy now.

14:46.368 --> 14:49.578
He's got a distinctive
tattoo on his left forearm.

14:49.578 --> 14:51.338
Find anything on those tapes?

14:51.338 --> 14:52.615
- I don't know.

14:53.651 --> 14:54.824
I'm on my way.

15:40.042 --> 15:41.319
- Hey, where are you going?

15:41.319 --> 15:42.803
Was there something
wrong with my face?

15:42.803 --> 15:44.805
What, do I have to drive a
nice car to connect with you?

15:44.805 --> 15:46.531
- No, it's 'cause
you have a penis.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.416
- Quiet, Jonathan, we don't
want to wake up your father.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.246
- Sorry, mom.

27:42.971 --> 27:45.284
Why do we always have
to do this in here, mom?

27:46.492 --> 27:49.633
I have a room or we
could to the hotel.

27:51.083 --> 27:54.949
- With what money are you
going to get a hotel room?

27:54.949 --> 27:56.364
We both know you don't work.

27:58.228 --> 28:01.507
Plus, I can't have your father
thinking I'm sleeping around.

28:01.507 --> 28:03.682
If he looked at his
credit card bill

28:03.682 --> 28:05.891
and saw that I'd been
staying in a hotel.

28:07.651 --> 28:10.274
Plus, your little brother's
right in the next room.

28:11.966 --> 28:14.002
- You could always
pay the hotel in cash.

28:15.210 --> 28:18.041
- I can't go
throwing money around.

28:19.525 --> 28:20.871
I have to take care of you

28:21.769 --> 28:23.046
and your little brother.

28:24.875 --> 28:26.705
You know your father
isn't working.

28:28.534 --> 28:31.882
- I just, I wanna be with you

28:33.539 --> 28:35.714
without it having
to be a secret.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.094
- Oh yeah?

28:37.094 --> 28:37.923
- Yeah, mommy.

28:39.096 --> 28:39.994
I love you.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.617
- Mommy loves her little Johnny.

28:43.894 --> 28:45.413
But it won't work.

28:46.966 --> 28:49.728
Not while your father and
brother are still alive.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.108
- But Kyle is nine.

28:52.316 --> 28:53.973
I can practically
raise him myself.

28:55.147 --> 28:56.907
- Yeah, but don't you
want to live your life?

28:58.046 --> 29:01.118
Don't you want to
enjoy it and have fun?

29:01.118 --> 29:03.120
- I want to be with you.

29:19.067 --> 29:20.862
- Go to your room, John.

29:20.862 --> 29:22.761
I'll be in, in a
minute to tuck you in.

30:04.595 --> 30:05.942
- Susan.

30:05.942 --> 30:07.495
Where are you going?

30:07.495 --> 30:09.808
- God, I just got up to go
to the bathroom, Stanley.

30:11.154 --> 30:13.225
- This side of the bed is cold.

30:13.225 --> 30:15.123
It's like nobody's been
there all night again.

30:15.123 --> 30:17.816
It's cold, Susan, ice cold.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.714
- What do you want me
to say to you, Stan?

30:19.714 --> 30:20.888
What do you want me to say?

30:20.888 --> 30:23.407
That I was at a hotel
fucking some guy?

30:23.407 --> 30:24.857
Would it make a difference?

30:24.857 --> 30:27.584
Would anything I say make a
difference to you at this point?

30:28.654 --> 30:29.862
- I still love you.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.312
- Wow.

30:31.312 --> 30:32.554
Well, you probably should
have thought of that

30:32.554 --> 30:33.797
before you fucked
your secretary.

30:33.797 --> 30:36.144
- I quit that job
for you, Susan.

30:37.594 --> 30:38.975
Just come back to bed, okay?

30:38.975 --> 30:39.768
- No.

30:40.942 --> 30:42.116
No, I'm going to go
make a cup of coffee.

30:42.116 --> 30:43.151
Do you want anything?

30:44.290 --> 30:45.084
- Yeah I do.

30:46.085 --> 30:47.086
I want my wife back.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.883
- Well, that ship has sailed.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.471
Go back to sleep, Stanley.

30:52.471 --> 30:54.645
- You know you look like
you've been with another man.

30:54.645 --> 30:56.095
- What if I had?

30:56.095 --> 30:57.407
What if I had?

30:57.407 --> 30:58.787
- Would you just fucking
come back to bed, Susan?

30:58.787 --> 31:00.237
Just come back to bed.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.080
- Mom?

31:15.080 --> 31:15.908
What's wrong?

31:20.050 --> 31:20.879
What's wrong?

31:22.846 --> 31:24.434
- It's your fucking father.

31:25.538 --> 31:27.368
He treats me like shit.

31:29.749 --> 31:32.269
I just wish I could be rid
of him and your brother.

31:34.030 --> 31:35.169
I just wanna live my life.

31:35.169 --> 31:36.895
I just wanna be free.

31:36.895 --> 31:37.861
- So do I, mom.

31:39.414 --> 31:41.692
- Do you really
mean that, Johnny?

31:41.692 --> 31:42.555
- Of course.

31:44.626 --> 31:45.938
You can get a divorce.

31:47.284 --> 31:49.114
Then you and I can
run away together.

31:52.117 --> 31:54.498
They way things are today
no one would ever know

31:54.498 --> 31:55.706
that you're my mom.

31:57.812 --> 32:00.608
They'll just think that you
have a really young boyfriend.

32:02.990 --> 32:03.852
- You know,

32:05.268 --> 32:09.134
Sigmund Freud said that every
boy wants to kill his father

32:10.929 --> 32:12.344
and make love to his mother.

32:15.105 --> 32:17.418
And you've made
love to me, Johnny.

32:19.316 --> 32:21.767
Are you ready to pay
the price for that love?

32:21.767 --> 32:22.733
- What do you mean?

32:26.634 --> 32:27.566
- You would never.

32:27.566 --> 32:28.463
- Never what?

32:32.053 --> 32:33.468
- You don't wanna know.

32:33.468 --> 32:34.400
- Come on, tell me.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.852
I'd do anything
just to have you.

32:48.104 --> 32:49.346
- Do you love me, Johnny?

32:52.694 --> 32:53.661
- You know I do, mom.

32:54.903 --> 32:56.975
- Do you love your father?

32:56.975 --> 32:57.803
- Of course.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.633
- What about your brother?

33:00.633 --> 33:01.531
- Of course.

33:03.498 --> 33:05.190
- But you love me
the most, right?

33:10.954 --> 33:11.990
- You know I do, mom.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.510
I love you more than anything.

33:19.307 --> 33:23.725
- Would you kill them for me?

33:27.867 --> 33:28.972
- What?

33:28.972 --> 33:29.973
- Would you?

33:32.872 --> 33:35.013
Will you kill them for me?

33:36.186 --> 33:37.636
- Mom, Kyle is nine.

33:38.775 --> 33:40.570
- He's not even your
fucking brother.

33:41.881 --> 33:43.124
- What do you mean?

33:43.124 --> 33:45.954
- Your father knocked
up his secretary

33:45.954 --> 33:47.922
and the bitch left
him with a baby.

33:47.922 --> 33:49.406
That is not my son.

33:49.406 --> 33:51.374
- That doesn't mean
he deserves to die.

33:52.271 --> 33:53.445
- I just wanna be free.

33:55.619 --> 33:57.035
- No, this isn't the way.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.175
- I thought you said
you loved me, Johnny.

33:59.175 --> 34:00.693
- You can get a divorce.

34:00.693 --> 34:02.523
- And risk losing everything?

34:02.523 --> 34:03.765
- If I do this I
can lose everything!

34:03.765 --> 34:05.767
- Then you have to
do it right, Johnny.

34:07.700 --> 34:11.670
I thought you said that
you would do anything

34:11.670 --> 34:13.396
to be with me.

34:13.396 --> 34:14.397
You said that.

34:14.397 --> 34:15.915
- Yeah, but not this.

34:15.915 --> 34:16.744
No.

34:20.023 --> 34:21.092
- Mom.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.197
- Don't call me that.

34:23.337 --> 34:24.855
- Mom, can you
make me breakfast?

34:24.855 --> 34:26.098
- Do not call me that.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.134
My name is Susan.

34:27.996 --> 34:28.859
- But why, mommy?

34:30.239 --> 34:33.347
- Don't fucking call me
mommy, my name is Susan.

34:33.347 --> 34:34.900
We've been over this.

34:34.900 --> 34:35.728
- Sorry.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.110
Think about it.

34:39.387 --> 34:40.630
- Yes, mom.

34:40.630 --> 34:42.839
- How come he gets
to call you mom?

34:44.047 --> 34:44.841
- Because

34:46.083 --> 34:47.809
he's my son and I love him.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.088
- So am I.

34:51.364 --> 34:52.193
- Mm-mm.

34:53.505 --> 34:55.748
You are the son of a whore

34:55.748 --> 34:58.234
that ruined this entire family.

34:58.234 --> 34:59.890
So, do you want
breakfast or not?

35:01.099 --> 35:02.997
- Okay, mommy.

35:02.997 --> 35:04.240
- Think about it.

35:27.297 --> 35:28.126
Hey.
- Hey.

35:34.235 --> 35:36.134
Wow, what is that about?

35:38.998 --> 35:40.793
- I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

35:42.001 --> 35:45.695
and you are right,
you are right,

35:45.695 --> 35:47.904
we really, really
need to work this out.

35:49.630 --> 35:50.941
- Really, Susan?

35:50.941 --> 35:51.770
Really?

35:51.770 --> 35:53.910
- Yes, yes!

35:53.910 --> 35:54.738
Really.

35:54.738 --> 35:55.808
Really, really.

35:57.534 --> 35:58.777
- I have to go to school.

37:19.202 --> 37:21.273
- Mommy loves her Johnny.

39:11.625 --> 39:14.006
- Mom, it's John.

39:14.006 --> 39:16.077
Mom.

39:16.077 --> 39:17.907
Mom, are you in there?

39:19.391 --> 39:21.980
Mom.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.533
Mom!

39:23.533 --> 39:24.465
Mom, open up!

39:25.432 --> 39:26.294
Mom!

40:13.031 --> 40:14.757
- Are you okay, baby?

40:32.222 --> 40:33.465
- Mommy!

40:37.642 --> 40:38.470
- Where's Johnny?

40:41.646 --> 40:43.855
- The incident was
really hard on him, babe.

40:43.855 --> 40:46.340
The paramedics had to
rip him off of you.

40:46.340 --> 40:49.585
He's been in his room
ever since this happened.

40:49.585 --> 40:52.450
He's been locked up in
there for, like, weeks.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.520
Had to try to get him some food

40:53.520 --> 40:55.245
and he seems to be eating it

40:55.245 --> 40:57.247
but he won't come
out and talk to me.

40:59.733 --> 41:02.114
You know how hard
this must be on a kid.

41:02.114 --> 41:05.152
Watching his mom go through
something like this.

41:06.705 --> 41:08.673
- Johnny's in his room then?

41:08.673 --> 41:09.501
- -Yeah.

41:10.916 --> 41:11.745
- Okay.

41:31.592 --> 41:32.455
Johnny?

41:33.491 --> 41:34.319
It's me.

41:41.257 --> 41:42.085
- Mom.

41:43.259 --> 41:46.158
I'd thought I'd
never see you again.

41:49.023 --> 41:50.991
I'm so glad you're okay.

41:56.997 --> 41:58.688
Why are you holding a knife?

42:00.138 --> 42:02.174
- Go lay down, Johnny,
I'm going to tuck you in.

42:03.348 --> 42:04.176
- Okay.

42:31.514 --> 42:32.550
- I love you, Johnny.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.036
- I love you too, mom.

42:36.036 --> 42:36.933
- No you don't.

42:41.351 --> 42:42.560
- Why would you say that?

42:45.183 --> 42:46.840
- I don't know.

42:46.840 --> 42:47.875
I'm just upset.

42:49.118 --> 42:50.257
- What, is it my fault?

42:51.396 --> 42:52.190
- No.

42:53.191 --> 42:54.364
No, it's not your fault.

42:56.504 --> 42:59.024
Unless you consider that
I gave you an option

42:59.024 --> 43:00.957
to help me escape and
you wouldn't do it

43:02.338 --> 43:04.582
so I had to explore
other options.

43:07.101 --> 43:09.276
- Mom, what are you saying?

43:09.276 --> 43:10.380
- I'm saying that,

43:12.106 --> 43:14.350
because you won't get rid
of your father and brother

43:14.350 --> 43:15.593
so we can be together

43:16.697 --> 43:18.665
maybe we can be
together in heaven,

43:18.665 --> 43:19.769
like Romeo and Juliet.

43:22.841 --> 43:24.429
- I don't want you to die, mom.

43:26.776 --> 43:28.053
- It's the only way.

43:36.717 --> 43:39.755
- Maybe there's another way.

43:42.723 --> 43:44.829
- But I thought you
said you wouldn't do it.

43:51.249 --> 43:53.596
- If it's to keep you alive.

43:55.391 --> 43:57.531
If it's to keep
you alive I will.

44:00.465 --> 44:01.673
- Oh, good boy.

44:05.228 --> 44:06.057
Good boy.

44:07.645 --> 44:08.507
Good boy.

45:46.191 --> 45:47.537
- I was thinking we could
get a sitter tomorrow night,

45:47.537 --> 45:49.436
go to a fancy dinner,
just you and me.

45:51.093 --> 45:53.371
- Don't you think it's a little
last minute for a sitter?

45:55.960 --> 45:58.963
- John's almost 17
he could watch Kyle.

45:58.963 --> 45:59.791
He's old enough.

46:02.000 --> 46:02.829
- Yeah.

46:08.282 --> 46:09.801
- What the fuck are
you doing, John?

46:09.801 --> 46:11.285
- I love you, mom!

46:15.186 --> 46:16.912
- John, what the fuck are doing?

46:16.912 --> 46:20.225
- I'm sorry, mom made me do it!

46:20.225 --> 46:21.192
- John!

46:25.161 --> 46:26.231
- Dad!

46:32.134 --> 46:33.273
- Help me.

46:33.273 --> 46:34.722
Help me.

46:34.722 --> 46:35.551
I'm losing.

46:35.551 --> 46:36.379
- Well, finish him!

46:37.208 --> 46:38.312
Do it!

46:38.312 --> 46:39.520
- No, I can't.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.936
I can't.

46:40.936 --> 46:42.213
- Help me.

46:42.213 --> 46:43.870
- Do I have to do
everything myself?

46:46.251 --> 46:47.805
- No, dad!

46:53.845 --> 46:54.708
Dad.

46:57.504 --> 46:58.746
I'm sorry, dad.

46:59.955 --> 47:01.404
- It's not finished yet.

47:19.353 --> 47:20.423
- I love you, mommy.

47:26.878 --> 47:28.811
- I love you too, baby.

48:26.834 --> 48:27.663
- You made it.

48:27.663 --> 48:28.940
Awesome.

48:28.940 --> 48:30.908
- Yes, I made it.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.599
Screaming and
cursing all the way.

48:33.565 --> 48:35.257
- I'm glad you decided to come.

48:35.257 --> 48:37.915
It's a tough thing to
admit, needing help.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.468
- I need help, that's for sure.

48:40.503 --> 48:42.091
- Ben's a great guy.

48:42.091 --> 48:43.921
He's knows firsthand
about the recovery.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.301
You can trust him.

48:45.301 --> 48:46.958
- I don't do good
with other people.

48:46.958 --> 48:48.718
- You do fine at the store.

48:48.718 --> 48:49.547
You'll be fine.

48:50.789 --> 48:51.825
- Okay.

48:51.825 --> 48:52.619
Let's do it.

48:57.244 --> 48:58.970
- Hannah, so glad you made it.

48:58.970 --> 49:00.247
- Never
miss a meeting, Ben.

49:00.247 --> 49:01.628
- That's what I like to hear.

49:03.526 --> 49:04.942
- Natalie?

49:04.942 --> 49:06.460
- Guilty as charged.

49:07.634 --> 49:09.222
- Sorry about
our meeting place.

49:09.222 --> 49:11.500
The old street theater
is the only place in town

49:11.500 --> 49:13.398
that supports us for the moment.

49:13.398 --> 49:16.091
There were, at one time,
about 10 different groups

49:16.091 --> 49:18.162
but now there's just us.

49:18.162 --> 49:20.233
The rest cease to exist.

49:20.233 --> 49:21.717
Their members stopped coming.

49:23.615 --> 49:24.582
- It's okay.

49:24.582 --> 49:25.445
Really, it is.

49:29.932 --> 49:32.417
- Good evening, everyone.

49:32.417 --> 49:36.283
Welcome to another meeting of
the Resurrection Survivors.

49:36.283 --> 49:38.941
I see we have a few
returning faces here,

49:38.941 --> 49:40.046
as well as a guest.

49:43.187 --> 49:44.015
Right.

49:45.810 --> 49:46.604
Okay,

49:48.192 --> 49:51.333
as always let's go around
and introduce ourselves,

49:51.333 --> 49:52.713
if we want to.

49:52.713 --> 49:54.992
You can use your real
name or create an alias.

49:56.165 --> 49:58.857
I think most of
you know my story,

49:58.857 --> 50:00.928
so I'll go last.

50:02.102 --> 50:04.208
Claire, would you
like to start us off?

50:06.658 --> 50:07.590
- I'm Claire.

50:11.732 --> 50:13.424
I watched my boyfriend
turn after he got bit

50:13.424 --> 50:16.254
and eventually watched
him follow the pack.

50:16.254 --> 50:18.394
Before that, though, I
fought hard for my life.

50:18.394 --> 50:20.914
He tried so many
times to get at me.

50:23.054 --> 50:23.917
I had to...

50:25.677 --> 50:27.679
Sever my own arm
off after he bit me

50:27.679 --> 50:30.337
just because of the fear of
turning into one of them.

50:34.479 --> 50:35.515
Remember then...

50:36.412 --> 50:37.827
Days later when we were told

50:37.827 --> 50:39.933
that not everyone
who was bit turned,

50:41.831 --> 50:43.799
so did I cut my own
arm off for nothing?

50:45.076 --> 50:46.733
Would I have been safe?

50:49.839 --> 50:50.668
- I'm Jerry.

50:52.118 --> 50:55.983
Damn, I'm sorry, I busted
in on you, didn't I, Claire?

50:55.983 --> 50:57.813
- No, I'm done, really.

50:57.813 --> 50:58.607
- Sure?

50:59.677 --> 51:00.678
Just making sure.

51:02.266 --> 51:03.094
Anyway,

51:05.683 --> 51:07.926
I wasn't really
affected by the undead,

51:09.411 --> 51:10.895
zombies,

51:10.895 --> 51:12.379
slow walkers,

51:12.379 --> 51:13.587
whatever they call them.

51:15.072 --> 51:15.934
No,

51:17.246 --> 51:18.316
I didn't lose anyone.

51:19.973 --> 51:21.181
I didn't kill anyone.

51:23.080 --> 51:26.048
I was involved with the
disposing of all those bodies.

51:32.227 --> 51:33.159
The stench.

51:35.471 --> 51:36.300
Damn.

51:39.820 --> 51:41.098
- Go ahead, Gale.

51:42.133 --> 51:42.961
- I'm Gale.

51:46.033 --> 51:49.796
I'm here because I
had to shoot my sister

51:49.796 --> 51:53.696
after she was attacked
by one of those rot bags,

51:53.696 --> 51:54.766
as they call them.

51:55.871 --> 51:56.665
- It's okay.

51:58.184 --> 51:59.357
- It's not okay.

52:00.496 --> 52:02.602
It's not like one of
those old horror movies,

52:02.602 --> 52:03.948
this is real life!

52:10.230 --> 52:12.853
We were getting ready for
our yearly trip, you know?

52:14.648 --> 52:16.133
The kids were at my mother's.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.410
It was just Amy and me.

52:20.516 --> 52:21.414
Remember

52:23.864 --> 52:25.832
when people used
to do normal thing?

52:28.938 --> 52:31.286
But it was just
like Claire said,

52:31.286 --> 52:32.839
I thought she'd turn.

52:32.839 --> 52:35.945
I mean, that's what
happens, right?

52:40.157 --> 52:42.400
- They never could find
a reason why some did

52:42.400 --> 52:43.332
and some didn't.

52:44.402 --> 52:46.335
My guess is we
aren't meant to know.

52:49.304 --> 52:50.960
- Hannah.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.548
You all know me.

52:52.548 --> 52:55.172
I defended my neighborhood
for two weeks straight.

52:57.070 --> 52:59.935
I guess killing off all those
I got to know over the years

52:59.935 --> 53:01.626
kinda took its toll on me.

53:03.283 --> 53:04.836
Some called me Superwoman

53:04.836 --> 53:07.184
but I don't like that.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.290
I just did what I had to do.

53:13.017 --> 53:13.845
- Thanks, Hannah.

53:17.470 --> 53:19.126
Would you like to
share anything?

53:23.717 --> 53:24.546
- Let's see.

53:26.168 --> 53:26.996
I'm Natalie.

53:29.171 --> 53:30.310
I'm a veterinarian.

53:31.415 --> 53:32.209
Was.

53:33.417 --> 53:35.833
Now I work in Hannah's
little hardware shop.

53:35.833 --> 53:39.975
I just started a few days ago.

53:39.975 --> 53:42.391
I guess you could
say she's my sponsor.

53:43.737 --> 53:44.566
Anyway,

53:46.533 --> 53:50.227
I quit being a vet
because I had a breakdown.

53:52.436 --> 53:53.264
Right.

53:55.818 --> 53:56.647
So I'm here.

53:59.270 --> 54:02.204
I'm here because I watched my
dead, one-year old daughter

54:02.204 --> 54:03.412
climb out of her grave.

54:07.451 --> 54:08.762
- No shit.

54:08.762 --> 54:10.730
- Yeah, real shit.

54:10.730 --> 54:12.076
Real, real shit.

54:14.768 --> 54:17.944
- And here I am going on
about hauling dead bodies.

54:18.910 --> 54:20.222
I can't even imagine.

54:21.775 --> 54:25.986
- God, Nat, you told me you
just had a loss in your family.

54:25.986 --> 54:27.505
You didn't tell me it was this.

54:28.437 --> 54:29.783
- No, I couldn't.

54:32.614 --> 54:35.064
I can't even get anyone
to talk to me anymore.

54:36.549 --> 54:38.033
Everyone knows what happened.

54:40.449 --> 54:44.315
When she died everyone treated
me like I had a disease.

54:45.972 --> 54:47.422
This is almost worse.

54:51.253 --> 54:52.081
- What did you do?

54:52.081 --> 54:53.773
- What could I do?

54:53.773 --> 54:55.568
I couldn't bring
myself to kill her.

54:58.709 --> 55:00.676
So I watched as she
joined the pack.

55:02.540 --> 55:04.646
She almost crawled,

55:04.646 --> 55:06.130
like she was still a baby.

55:12.723 --> 55:15.553
It's so hard losing a
child once to illness.

55:17.037 --> 55:18.867
But a second time?

55:18.867 --> 55:19.799
Like this.

55:28.911 --> 55:30.154
I really lost it.

55:31.224 --> 55:32.639
Really.

55:32.639 --> 55:33.468
I did.

55:34.883 --> 55:36.367
My husband left me.

55:37.541 --> 55:38.749
Probably for the best.

55:45.100 --> 55:47.482
- I think you'll fit
right in with us, Natalie.

55:50.795 --> 55:52.728
- Where do the packs go?

55:52.728 --> 55:54.212
Does anyone have any ideas?

55:55.662 --> 55:56.801
- We really don't
know what happened

55:56.801 --> 55:59.079
to all of the undead, do we?

56:00.218 --> 56:03.049
I mean, we do know that
thousands of bodies

56:03.049 --> 56:04.361
were disposed of properly

56:04.361 --> 56:07.087
but what about those
we didn't find?

56:08.675 --> 56:10.436
Those we didn't
hunt down and kill?

56:11.678 --> 56:12.472
Yeah.

56:13.887 --> 56:15.372
Where did some of them go?

56:17.166 --> 56:19.445
- I read somewhere where
some people took 'em in

56:19.445 --> 56:22.171
as pets, you know?

56:23.241 --> 56:24.519
- That's messed up.

56:24.519 --> 56:25.382
- Fucked up.

56:26.624 --> 56:28.315
- I heard the same
thing as well.

56:30.421 --> 56:32.458
- The world will
never be the same.

56:33.700 --> 56:35.081
It'll always be fucked up.

56:36.323 --> 56:39.603
No matter how much we
rebuild, restructure,

56:39.603 --> 56:41.190
rearrange our lives.

56:42.502 --> 56:44.297
We've changed for good.

56:55.998 --> 56:58.035
- If there's anything I can do.

56:58.035 --> 56:59.726
- I could use some more company.

56:59.726 --> 57:01.590
It was a lot to take in.

57:01.590 --> 57:04.248
- Yeah, why don't we hit
that coffee shop over there?

57:05.422 --> 57:08.528
- No, let's head
over to my place.

57:08.528 --> 57:11.635
It's so hard to get good
people back into my life.

57:11.635 --> 57:14.603
- Yeah, people have changed.

57:14.603 --> 57:15.708
It's not like it was.

57:29.169 --> 57:30.757
- It's not very much but--

57:30.757 --> 57:31.931
- Better than what I have.

57:31.931 --> 57:33.311
- Any
preference for coffee?

57:33.311 --> 57:35.590
- Whatever you have
as long as it's hot.

57:35.590 --> 57:36.832
- That I can do.

57:38.006 --> 57:40.249
- So, you found
the group helpful?

57:40.249 --> 57:41.078
- Very.

57:42.631 --> 57:45.323
- Considering that
the Resurrection only
lasted a few weeks.

57:45.323 --> 57:48.257
It's going to take a
lifetime to undo the harm.

57:48.257 --> 57:51.502
- I still wonder where all
the undead went though.

57:51.502 --> 57:52.710
Think about it.

57:52.710 --> 57:54.229
- I know.

57:54.229 --> 57:55.575
Most just vanished.

57:57.025 --> 57:59.268
- I don't like the idea of
people keeping them as pets.

58:00.131 --> 58:02.720
- Maybe not as pets.

58:02.720 --> 58:04.757
More like keeping their
loved ones close by.

58:04.757 --> 58:05.654
- Come again?

58:06.621 --> 58:08.277
- Think about it.

58:08.277 --> 58:11.557
If you could not bring
yourself to kill your loved one

58:11.557 --> 58:12.489
what would you do?

58:14.491 --> 58:16.009
- They were dead to begin with.

58:16.009 --> 58:19.530
- Right, but could you really
bring yourself to kill them?

58:21.739 --> 58:22.568
- Good point.

58:23.914 --> 58:25.467
I can't imagine what it was like

58:25.467 --> 58:28.505
watching your daughter crawl
away to join the rest of them.

58:30.092 --> 58:31.715
- That's what I
have this group for.

58:35.684 --> 58:36.996
- I'll get my coffee.

58:36.996 --> 58:38.963
- No, really, I can.

58:49.767 --> 58:52.874
- I thought you said you'd
never been to a group like ours.

58:52.874 --> 58:53.702
- Dammit.

58:54.876 --> 58:57.430
Looks like I forgot
to take out the trash.

58:57.430 --> 58:59.915
- There were at one
time about 10 different groups

58:59.915 --> 59:03.367
but the rest just
ceased to exist.

59:03.367 --> 59:04.575
Members stopped coming.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.234
- Maybe not as pets.

59:08.234 --> 59:10.857
More like keeping your
loved ones close by.

59:10.857 --> 59:14.102
If you could not bring
yourself to kill your loved one

59:14.102 --> 59:15.137
what would you do?

59:21.385 --> 59:22.869
Shut up, Hannah!

59:22.869 --> 59:24.491
It's still her nap time.

59:39.230 --> 59:41.578
Maybe I am crazy.

59:42.579 --> 59:44.477
Maybe I just love my family.

59:47.860 --> 59:51.588
I'm so happy for
these therapy groups.

59:51.588 --> 59:55.764
I have had such a hard
time finding people

59:55.764 --> 59:59.630
who understand my issues.

01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:04.531
How else could I get
them in here for her?

01:00:04.531 --> 01:00:05.602
She has to eat.

01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:11.677
- Please no, don't do this!

01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:13.126
For the love of God.

01:00:13.126 --> 01:00:15.128
- God?

01:00:15.128 --> 01:00:16.647
I don't believe in his love.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:20.478
However, I do believe in the
love I have for my daughter.

01:00:21.825 --> 01:00:23.102
And that will never die.

01:04:37.011 --> 01:04:38.012
- It's just a bag.

01:04:38.012 --> 01:04:38.978
It's not important.

01:04:40.531 --> 01:04:43.051
Set in motion there is no
stopping the unstoppable.

01:04:44.742 --> 01:04:45.571
Stop.

01:04:46.537 --> 01:04:48.850
This is not where we are going.

01:05:05.522 --> 01:05:08.180
Stop the car, now!

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.008
- No.

01:05:09.008 --> 01:05:10.907
We are not there yet.

01:06:09.655 --> 01:06:10.483
Stop!

01:06:12.899 --> 01:06:13.970
Put it down!

01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:40.677
- Thank Christ.

01:07:40.677 --> 01:07:42.403
- I wouldn't thank him yet, man.

01:07:43.783 --> 01:07:44.750
- Guys, I really need your help.

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:46.752
I fucked up big this time.

01:07:48.133 --> 01:07:50.825
- That is really not a
very good opener, Jeremy.

01:07:50.825 --> 01:07:52.206
Why don't you cut to the chase

01:07:52.206 --> 01:07:54.518
because I got Daisy
back watching the bar

01:07:54.518 --> 01:07:56.417
and you know I hate that
fucking crazy bitch.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:58.522
- Man, seriously, I'm
tripping out right now.

01:07:58.522 --> 01:08:00.559
I don't know what
the fuck to do.

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:03.079
- Just, seriously,
Jeremy, calm down.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.839
You know we've got your back.

01:08:04.839 --> 01:08:06.323
I got you.

01:08:06.323 --> 01:08:07.945
- Why don't we wait and
see what the situation is

01:08:07.945 --> 01:08:10.603
before you say you
have his back, bro?

01:08:15.574 --> 01:08:18.301
- Probably better off
if I just show you guys.

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:20.026
- Well, that sounds--
- Come on.

01:08:23.788 --> 01:08:25.584
- Oh my god!

01:08:25.584 --> 01:08:27.379
Jeremy, you have to
be fucking kidding me.

01:08:27.379 --> 01:08:29.174
- Jeremy, what the
fuck happened to her?

01:08:29.174 --> 01:08:33.488
- Brett, the less we know about
this situation the better.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:34.696
Give me my fucking keys.

01:08:35.594 --> 01:08:36.939
- What, you're leaving?

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:38.113
- Yeah, we're leaving.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:39.943
- Man, I need you!

01:08:39.943 --> 01:08:40.875
Seriously!

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:42.394
- You know what you need?

01:08:42.394 --> 01:08:43.809
You need a fucking lawyer.

01:08:43.809 --> 01:08:44.844
Seriously.

01:08:46.018 --> 01:08:47.502
- I didn't want to
have to do this.

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:49.676
- Oh, good, why don't
you go with your gut.

01:08:52.335 --> 01:08:53.750
- I know all your shit, man.

01:08:55.027 --> 01:08:57.133
I'll tell Candace
all about Maria.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.031
Tell her about the money.

01:08:59.031 --> 01:08:59.859
The kid.

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:03.207
- That's real bro code breaking

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:04.692
what you're doing, my friend.

01:09:06.107 --> 01:09:07.350
- I'll do it.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:11.630
- So, you're willing
to risk my business,

01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:14.770
my family, my house, my bar,

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:17.738
for some dead bitch in
the trunk of your car?

01:09:20.432 --> 01:09:22.917
You know, a divorce,

01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:25.022
it may break my bank

01:09:25.022 --> 01:09:27.542
but a murder one rap, my friend,

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:30.856
that's some shit that you're
not walking away from.

01:09:30.856 --> 01:09:34.618
- I have covered up every
one of your shady secrets.

01:09:34.618 --> 01:09:37.103
I've taken out every guy
you've ever pointed at.

01:09:37.103 --> 01:09:38.622
And I've silenced every
one of them strippers

01:09:38.622 --> 01:09:40.693
that has ever polished you off.

01:09:40.693 --> 01:09:43.971
You could do this one
damned thing for me

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:46.078
and I'll never ask you
for anything again.

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:49.323
- What do you think, Brett?

01:09:49.323 --> 01:09:51.359
How do you feel about this?

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:54.259
- Perry, we've been
friends since we were kids.

01:09:54.259 --> 01:09:55.121
He's family.

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:57.089
- So?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.439
- And I owe him $10,000.

01:10:04.752 --> 01:10:06.478
15.

01:10:06.478 --> 01:10:07.306
20?

01:10:08.169 --> 01:10:09.998
Fucking I owe you 20?

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:12.932
He's family, Perry.

01:10:13.864 --> 01:10:14.969
- That's where it's at, right?

01:10:14.969 --> 01:10:16.039
That's where it's at.

01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:22.908
Get over there and get
the body out of the trunk.

01:10:24.668 --> 01:10:28.293
I can't believe I'm fucking
helping your with this bullshit.

01:10:36.749 --> 01:10:38.199
- Sit her over there.

01:10:38.199 --> 01:10:41.202
- Wow, this isn't rapey at all.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.448
Jeremy, you got
your hobo mattress,

01:10:46.725 --> 01:10:48.416
your leaky pipes, desolation.

01:10:50.107 --> 01:10:51.661
- Let me ask you,

01:10:51.661 --> 01:10:54.733
do panties just evaporate in
a swinging joint like this?

01:10:55.941 --> 01:10:57.805
- Is this where you
bring all your pussies

01:10:57.805 --> 01:10:59.047
that you crush

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:00.532
or just the ones that
like role playing

01:11:00.532 --> 01:11:01.705
Nightmare on Elm Street?

01:11:02.844 --> 01:11:05.364
- Come on, I didn't
mean for this to happen.

01:11:05.364 --> 01:11:08.125
- Well, why don't you tell us

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:09.644
exactly what did happen?

01:11:12.509 --> 01:11:15.098
- Just, the usual.

01:11:15.098 --> 01:11:16.893
At the bar

01:11:16.893 --> 01:11:18.032
trying to get lucky,

01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:20.897
it's hardly any girls in there.

01:11:22.968 --> 01:11:25.419
- Almost closing time, Daisy.

01:11:25.419 --> 01:11:27.697
I am getting angsty, if
you know what I mean.

01:11:27.697 --> 01:11:29.077
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.734
It's pretty dead
in here tonight.

01:11:30.734 --> 01:11:31.563
But.

01:11:33.254 --> 01:11:35.014
- Oh, well, fuck me.

01:11:36.015 --> 01:11:37.845
- That' the idea, isn't it?

01:11:39.536 --> 01:11:41.020
- Talk to her yet?

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.470
- Nope.

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:44.541
She hasn't said five words
since she got in here.

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:48.476
She's giving off that kind
of bitchy, high class vibe.

01:11:48.476 --> 01:11:50.789
She's probably out
of your league.

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:52.066
- Oh, shut up,

01:11:52.066 --> 01:11:53.309
You met one out
of my league yet?

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:59.591
- Ooh, looks like you
may have an interception.

01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:00.592
- Oh.

01:12:00.592 --> 01:12:02.145
I'm not too worried about that.

01:12:06.632 --> 01:12:07.461
- Hey.

01:12:07.461 --> 01:12:08.945
- Hey, Daisy.

01:12:08.945 --> 01:12:09.877
Can I get one more before
I leave for the night?

01:12:09.877 --> 01:12:10.533
- Sure thing, hun.

01:12:10.533 --> 01:12:11.361
- Thank you.

01:12:15.848 --> 01:12:16.677
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:16.677 --> 01:12:18.161
How ya doing?

01:12:18.161 --> 01:12:19.818
- I'm better now.

01:12:19.818 --> 01:12:21.198
- Oh.

01:12:21.198 --> 01:12:22.027
Thank you.

01:12:25.306 --> 01:12:26.963
So, what's going on?

01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:31.312
- You smell sweet.

01:12:31.312 --> 01:12:33.141
- That's probably
just my body spray.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.696
- Get the fuck outta here!

01:12:37.007 --> 01:12:39.769
- I don't have much
of a sweet tooth but.

01:12:40.597 --> 01:12:41.426
You'll do.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.463
- Thanks, I guess.

01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:47.915
- You're not giving up.

01:12:47.915 --> 01:12:49.779
- Goddamn, I'm going in.

01:12:49.779 --> 01:12:51.056
- Hey,

01:12:51.056 --> 01:12:53.852
don't forget to
set up the camera.

01:12:59.582 --> 01:13:02.101
- I would like
to buy you a drink.

01:13:04.345 --> 01:13:07.279
- No, you're not sweet.

01:13:07.279 --> 01:13:09.315
- But I'm special.

01:13:09.315 --> 01:13:10.800
- I'm sorry, hun.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.388
He's a little bit more my type.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.665
- Of course he is.

01:13:13.665 --> 01:13:16.322
Genetics lottery beats
personality every time.

01:13:16.322 --> 01:13:17.703
You kids have fun, okay?

01:13:17.703 --> 01:13:19.325
- Better luck next time, champ.

01:13:19.325 --> 01:13:20.465
- Yeah, thanks, coach.

01:13:25.711 --> 01:13:26.954
- Get 'em next time, buddy.

01:13:26.954 --> 01:13:27.955
It's all right.

01:13:27.955 --> 01:13:29.405
- Thanks, bro.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.580
- Oh, Stu, when do
you ever learn to just

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.893
stay in your own league?

01:13:34.893 --> 01:13:36.653
- I dunno, maybe when
Handsome Dan back there

01:13:36.653 --> 01:13:38.241
doesn't need his
creepy ass sister

01:13:38.241 --> 01:13:40.416
to hook him up with booty calls.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.831
- Jealous much?

01:13:42.728 --> 01:13:43.798
- Fuck you, Daisy.

01:13:47.353 --> 01:13:49.148
This bar is full of dicks.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.428
- Let me get this straight,

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.499
you guys roofied her?

01:13:54.499 --> 01:13:57.053
- I thought we just
gave her a pinch.

01:13:57.053 --> 01:13:59.676
- Jesus Christ, Jeremy!

01:13:59.676 --> 01:14:01.160
- We were having a good time

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.473
and she started talking
about her kids and shit.

01:14:03.473 --> 01:14:05.026
Started looking
like less of a lock,

01:14:05.026 --> 01:14:06.545
and I didn't even
think it was working

01:14:06.545 --> 01:14:08.340
so I slipped her
a little bit more.

01:14:10.376 --> 01:14:11.585
- Fucking idiot.

01:14:11.585 --> 01:14:13.241
- I didn't think we
gave her that much

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.726
but she blacked out immediately,

01:14:14.726 --> 01:14:16.590
I couldn't bring her back.

01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:19.385
She's just gone, man, dead.

01:14:19.385 --> 01:14:20.214
- Wonderful.

01:14:21.111 --> 01:14:22.319
- What would you have done?

01:14:22.319 --> 01:14:24.149
Man, look at her, she's
a fucking knockout.

01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:26.841
I couldn't take
a loss like that.

01:14:26.841 --> 01:14:28.809
- Perry, it's not wrong.

01:14:30.362 --> 01:14:31.570
- He's right.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.330
Yeah, you're right,
Jeremy, you're right.

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:35.954
Instead of lose another
notch on your bedpost

01:14:35.954 --> 01:14:39.060
why not render beautiful
woman comatose?

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.304
Just pound away.

01:14:41.304 --> 01:14:44.307
Kinda like, necrophilia.

01:14:44.307 --> 01:14:46.896
- Oh, Perry, that's gross.

01:14:47.759 --> 01:14:50.037
I mean, she, no.

01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:52.073
Perry, that's gross.

01:14:53.074 --> 01:14:54.248
- Man, fuck you guys.

01:14:54.248 --> 01:14:55.491
I didn't do that shit.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.699
She was unresponsive.

01:14:56.699 --> 01:14:59.046
I checked her pulse
there was nothing.

01:14:59.046 --> 01:14:59.909
- Check it again.

01:14:59.909 --> 01:15:01.151
- Why?

01:15:01.151 --> 01:15:03.429
- Because I said
to check it again.

01:15:03.429 --> 01:15:04.879
Because if she is not dead

01:15:04.879 --> 01:15:07.433
I am not risking
getting my hands dirty

01:15:07.433 --> 01:15:09.366
over your shit.

01:15:09.366 --> 01:15:10.747
She comes back to life,

01:15:10.747 --> 01:15:13.509
you tell her the bedroom
shenanigans got a little crazy.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:14.924
- Fucking dead, okay?

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:20.446
- Brett, will you check
her pulse, please?

01:15:21.482 --> 01:15:23.001
- No.

01:15:23.001 --> 01:15:25.866
I'm not going to fucking
touch a dead chick.

01:15:25.866 --> 01:15:27.833
Perry, why the fuck
do I have to do it?

01:15:29.007 --> 01:15:31.527
- Because I pay you to the shit

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.563
that I fucking don't wanna do.

01:15:34.702 --> 01:15:35.772
- Fuck, okay.

01:15:43.815 --> 01:15:44.781
No, I got nothing.

01:15:45.851 --> 01:15:46.680
- Are you sure?

01:15:48.164 --> 01:15:51.029
- I'm no doctor but pretty
sure I can count to zero.

01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:53.652
- All right.

01:15:53.652 --> 01:15:54.515
All right.

01:15:56.034 --> 01:15:57.587
This is what we're going to do.

01:15:58.726 --> 01:16:00.003
You're going to take her body,

01:16:00.003 --> 01:16:02.558
you're gonna put it in
the trunk of your car,

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.181
you're gonna drive her
out to the pig farm

01:16:05.181 --> 01:16:08.080
next to the
slaughterhouse on US 23.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.599
Now, it's real
Boonville out there,

01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:11.463
there's not a lot of people.

01:16:11.463 --> 01:16:12.844
You wanna keep
your headlights off

01:16:12.844 --> 01:16:15.191
so you don't get seen
by the farm, all right?

01:16:16.123 --> 01:16:17.055
- Okay.

01:16:17.055 --> 01:16:18.297
Do you know someone out there?

01:16:18.297 --> 01:16:19.782
- Yeah, pigs.

01:16:19.782 --> 01:16:21.231
You throw her over the fence

01:16:21.231 --> 01:16:23.579
the next morning the
only thing left is bones.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:24.821
Maybe not even that.

01:16:25.684 --> 01:16:27.030
- How do you know for sure?

01:16:28.238 --> 01:16:29.861
- Jeremy, you don't need
to ask how I know that.

01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:31.690
Now, fucking get to it!

01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:33.658
- What, you're not
going to come with me?

01:16:33.658 --> 01:16:35.452
- No, we're not coming with you.

01:16:35.452 --> 01:16:38.007
You're lucky that we even
came out here tonight.

01:16:38.007 --> 01:16:39.629
Just fucking get it done.

01:16:45.877 --> 01:16:48.880
- I don't know, it
sounded like it was.

01:16:50.675 --> 01:16:52.021
- How
could that be her?

01:16:52.021 --> 01:16:53.609
That didn't even sound human.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.024
- Uh, guys!

01:16:56.508 --> 01:16:59.304
- Where the fuck did she go?

01:16:59.304 --> 01:17:02.065
- I fucking just saw her.

01:17:02.065 --> 01:17:05.310
I mean, there wasn't
even a fucking sound.

01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:06.622
- Oh my god.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.313
- Calm down.

01:17:08.313 --> 01:17:10.177
She could not have gotten far.

01:17:10.177 --> 01:17:11.799
- That's what I'm saying.

01:17:11.799 --> 01:17:13.629
If she's around here
she's heard everything

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.285
we've been saying.

01:17:15.285 --> 01:17:16.804
- Which changes
virtually nothing.

01:17:16.804 --> 01:17:20.014
Just find her and
let's get out of here.

01:17:44.383 --> 01:17:45.212
- Oh!

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.386
Hey.

01:17:47.386 --> 01:17:48.491
- Where am I?

01:17:49.423 --> 01:17:51.114
What happened?

01:17:51.114 --> 01:17:52.978
Did you drug me?

01:17:52.978 --> 01:17:53.807
- No.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.327
- Where are we and who are they?

01:17:59.122 --> 01:18:01.504
- These are just my friends.

01:18:01.504 --> 01:18:04.058
You passed out and
I took you here

01:18:04.058 --> 01:18:06.820
just to make sure
that you were okay.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.511
- I passed out?

01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:09.719
- Yeah, in the car.

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:12.446
I think maybe you had a
few too many to drink.

01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:14.586
I was just trying
to take care of you.

01:18:14.586 --> 01:18:17.416
- I taste the pills.

01:18:21.006 --> 01:18:24.941
- I don't understand
there was no pills.

01:18:24.941 --> 01:18:25.770
- Did you.

01:18:27.564 --> 01:18:30.913
- Oh, no, no, we didn't.

01:18:31.879 --> 01:18:35.572
We could if you wanted to but.

01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:41.717
- I wanted to take you
home to meet my children.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:42.579
Remember?

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.513
I told you they're home.

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:46.998
And they're probably starving.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:53.729
- It's really late but maybe
we could find a drive-through

01:18:54.315 --> 01:18:55.834
or something?

01:18:55.834 --> 01:18:58.181
Pick them up some food and
we could take it to them.

01:18:59.562 --> 01:19:01.150
- They have peculiar tastes.

01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:04.118
Where's my phone?

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.743
- It's probably in my trunk.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.606
- What the hell
is going on here?

01:19:11.919 --> 01:19:14.646
- We were just trying to
make sure that you were okay.

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:20.652
- What?

01:19:23.068 --> 01:19:23.897
Stop!

01:19:26.037 --> 01:19:27.901
What the hell?

01:19:27.901 --> 01:19:30.213
Please, let me go!

01:19:30.213 --> 01:19:34.631
- Just relax, have seat, this
is just getting really weird.

01:19:34.631 --> 01:19:37.082
We need to get this done
as soon as possible.

01:19:37.082 --> 01:19:38.601
- What
are you doing, man?

01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:41.052
- What you should have done
in the beginning, Jeremy.

01:19:42.156 --> 01:19:44.227
Brett, will you please
go get the ropes

01:19:44.227 --> 01:19:46.160
out of the back of my car?

01:19:47.472 --> 01:19:49.439
- What, you're gonna kill her?

01:19:49.439 --> 01:19:50.786
- Eventually.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.684
She's seen all our faces.

01:19:52.684 --> 01:19:53.512
- Please!

01:19:55.549 --> 01:19:56.757
Help!

01:19:56.757 --> 01:19:58.517
My children need
me, I'm begging you!

01:19:58.517 --> 01:20:00.623
They're starving!

01:20:00.623 --> 01:20:01.866
- Jesus Christ, man.

01:20:01.866 --> 01:20:03.591
- This is fucking psychology.

01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:05.041
This is mind games, man.

01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:07.388
She's trying to gain sympathy.

01:20:07.388 --> 01:20:09.080
- I don't know, man.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.737
- No, please,
just let me go.

01:20:11.737 --> 01:20:12.738
They need me.

01:20:14.361 --> 01:20:17.329
- What the fuck are you
waiting for, dipshit?

01:20:17.329 --> 01:20:19.780
Get the shit out
of the trunk now.

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.231
- Come on, man, she's got kids.

01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:24.958
- Fuck you, Conan,
I have fucking kids.

01:20:24.958 --> 01:20:27.753
Get the fucking shit
outta the trunk!

01:20:27.753 --> 01:20:30.135
- Fuck you so much, Perry.

01:20:30.135 --> 01:20:31.033
So much.

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:41.284
- This shit isn't right, man.

01:20:42.734 --> 01:20:44.218
- You got me into
this shit, man.

01:20:44.218 --> 01:20:46.842
You called me out here
for a mop and bucket job.

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:49.914
Just to clean up your fuck up.

01:20:49.914 --> 01:20:50.742
- Jeremy,

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.470
please.

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.299
- She knows who you are.

01:20:56.299 --> 01:20:58.923
You get roped, we all go down.

01:21:02.133 --> 01:21:03.824
- Perry, did you see something?

01:21:03.824 --> 01:21:05.999
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:07.483
Will you fucking pay attention?

01:21:07.483 --> 01:21:10.520
This is some serious
shit right now.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.521
- All right.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.606
- Hey!

01:21:28.849 --> 01:21:29.746
Who's out there?

01:21:32.853 --> 01:21:33.681
Fuck this.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.167
- Have you always
been this stupid?

01:21:36.167 --> 01:21:38.341
- I thought that I
accidentally almost killed her.

01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:39.756
- Seriously, we need
to get outta here.

01:21:39.756 --> 01:21:43.001
I'm pretty sure I heard
somebody playing around outside.

01:21:43.001 --> 01:21:44.244
- Playing around?

01:21:44.244 --> 01:21:46.694
At 3:15 in the morning.

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:48.904
- I dunno, man, it
sounded like kids.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.940
- Yeah, yeah, my babies.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.148
My babies they're getting close.

01:21:52.148 --> 01:21:53.943
Please, I beg you, let me go.

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:55.496
Please, let me go!

01:21:55.496 --> 01:21:58.085
- Shut your mouth
or I will duct tape

01:21:58.085 --> 01:22:00.191
those goddamn lips shut myself.

01:22:01.295 --> 01:22:02.952
- I think we should just.

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:03.815
- Just what?

01:22:03.815 --> 01:22:04.954
Just let her go?

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:06.438
Let her go straight
to the police?

01:22:06.438 --> 01:22:08.337
Let her tell them our names?

01:22:08.337 --> 01:22:09.510
Really, Jeremy?

01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:11.788
Use your fucking head!

01:22:11.788 --> 01:22:13.894
- I won't say a word, I promise.

01:22:13.894 --> 01:22:15.102
I promise, I won't say anything.

01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:16.034
Please, I'm begging.

01:22:16.034 --> 01:22:17.518
I just wanna see my babies.

01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:19.555
- Your babies.

01:22:19.555 --> 01:22:20.521
Your babies.

01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:22.178
I'm so sick of this bullshit.

01:22:22.178 --> 01:22:24.215
What are their
fucking names, huh?

01:22:26.838 --> 01:22:27.977
- Connor,

01:22:30.911 --> 01:22:32.154
and Becky.

01:22:32.154 --> 01:22:33.431
- Bullshit.

01:22:33.431 --> 01:22:34.259
It's all bullshit.

01:22:34.259 --> 01:22:35.674
It's all fucking lies.

01:22:35.674 --> 01:22:37.090
- And...

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:40.162
Camille.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:42.785
And James.

01:22:42.785 --> 01:22:43.682
- What did you say?

01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:48.549
You told her my kids' names?

01:22:48.549 --> 01:22:50.344
You fucking told
her my kids' names?

01:22:50.344 --> 01:22:51.449
You sick fuck.

01:22:51.449 --> 01:22:52.760
- No, man.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.003
- Why would you do that?
- I didn't say anything!

01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:55.280
- Why did you tell
her my kids' names?

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.661
- I swear, man, I
didn't say anything.

01:22:56.661 --> 01:22:57.696
Your kids never came up.

01:22:57.696 --> 01:22:59.181
Why the fuck would I do that?

01:22:59.181 --> 01:23:00.906
- How the fuck does
she know that shit?

01:23:00.906 --> 01:23:02.632
How do you know this shit?

01:23:02.632 --> 01:23:07.637
- On Norwood, you're on the
last house on the left side.

01:23:09.432 --> 01:23:11.710
And Candace,

01:23:12.608 --> 01:23:15.266
she planted those daisies,

01:23:15.266 --> 01:23:16.819
and you hate them.

01:23:16.819 --> 01:23:20.478
And Camille, she's still
up when you come home.

01:23:20.478 --> 01:23:22.411
She pretends she's
asleep but she hears--

01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:23.895
- Shut up!
- When you come in the front.

01:23:23.895 --> 01:23:25.172
- Shut up!

01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:26.035
Shut the fuck up!

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.417
- James,

01:23:28.417 --> 01:23:29.211
he's crying

01:23:30.695 --> 01:23:33.318
because he knows that you're
not going to his game tomorrow.

01:23:35.976 --> 01:23:36.977
- Who do you fucking
know that I know, bitch?

01:23:36.977 --> 01:23:38.116
Who? Tell me!

01:23:38.116 --> 01:23:39.255
You tell her this shit?

01:23:39.255 --> 01:23:41.878
Did he tell you this shit?

01:23:41.878 --> 01:23:42.707
Shit.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.709
- And Candace,

01:23:45.675 --> 01:23:46.952
she's done with you.

01:23:48.333 --> 01:23:50.508
She only cares about the kids.

01:23:51.716 --> 01:23:54.581
She's just gonna pack
up and that's the end.

01:23:54.581 --> 01:23:58.067
And she's just gonna leave!

01:23:58.067 --> 01:23:58.930
- Perry?

01:24:01.312 --> 01:24:02.140
- Done.

01:24:03.693 --> 01:24:05.695
US 23 pig farm.

01:24:05.695 --> 01:24:07.249
If this gets traced back to me

01:24:07.249 --> 01:24:08.698
in any fucking way

01:24:08.698 --> 01:24:11.391
I will find a way
to kill both of you.

01:24:11.391 --> 01:24:12.668
- Leave you forever.

01:24:14.532 --> 01:24:16.568
And the papers
will be in the mail

01:24:17.569 --> 01:24:20.055
within a week of her departure.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.574
- What the fuck?

01:24:22.574 --> 01:24:23.575
- My babies.

01:24:25.025 --> 01:24:27.476
- Yeah, we know,
you're babies are hungry.

01:24:28.994 --> 01:24:30.513
- Are here.

01:24:30.513 --> 01:24:31.756
What?

01:24:31.756 --> 01:24:33.861
What the fuck is that?

01:24:43.147 --> 01:24:44.700
- Perry, you mother fucker!

01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:03.028
- Mother.

01:25:04.029 --> 01:25:04.858
Mom?

01:25:05.721 --> 01:25:07.447
- What the fuck you do?

01:25:09.207 --> 01:25:10.864
Where's our mother?

01:25:10.864 --> 01:25:12.417
Where's our mother?

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.684
- It was so nice

01:25:37.684 --> 01:25:41.481
of you to bring extras
for my babies, Jeremy.

01:25:41.481 --> 01:25:43.276
I knew they would
just love you too.

01:25:44.173 --> 01:25:45.588
Every last bite.

01:26:35.707 --> 01:26:37.088
- Hey.

01:26:37.088 --> 01:26:38.710
Did you have fun
with my brother?

01:26:41.023 --> 01:26:41.886
What the fuck?

01:26:42.818 --> 01:26:44.854
Where's my brother?

01:26:44.854 --> 01:26:46.201
Where's Jeremy?

01:26:47.098 --> 01:26:49.618
- Why don't you fucking tell me?

01:26:49.618 --> 01:26:51.965
- Where the fuck is my brother?

01:26:53.932 --> 01:26:57.108
Listen, bitch, if you
know what's best for you

01:26:57.108 --> 01:26:59.766
you'll get the
fuck outta my bar.

01:27:03.839 --> 01:27:06.082
- You know it's funny
because your brother

01:27:06.082 --> 01:27:07.360
he's gutless.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.051
And my children we don't like

01:27:10.155 --> 01:27:13.228
the taste of a coward
or malevolence.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:15.678
It's kind of tangy.

01:27:15.678 --> 01:27:16.852
You wouldn't know that.

01:27:17.715 --> 01:27:20.235
Okay, because the sweet guys,

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:23.997
well, the emit a different odor.

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:30.624
- So, wait a second,
you ate my brother

01:27:31.763 --> 01:27:34.628
because you think
cowards taste better?

01:27:35.733 --> 01:27:38.183
Are you fucking insane?

01:27:38.183 --> 01:27:39.840
- No, of course not.

01:27:40.703 --> 01:27:41.911
No, I'm a mother.

01:27:43.361 --> 01:27:45.052
And all good mothers

01:27:46.916 --> 01:27:49.747
we allow our children
to eat first!
