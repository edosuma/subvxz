Previously on <i>The Secret Life</i>
<i>of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.268 --> 00:05.102
Are you doing anything
next Saturday night?

00:05.136 --> 00:06.403
Were you just going to
ask Grace out

00:06.438 --> 00:08.172
while I'm standing right
here in front of you?

00:08.206 --> 00:10.140
I need someone to go
to the senior dance with.

00:10.175 --> 00:11.442
Did Leo fire you?

00:11.476 --> 00:12.576
I quit.

00:12.611 --> 00:14.378
I take it you
fell off the wagon?

00:14.412 --> 00:16.113
Night before last.
I got drunk.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.515
This is your last chance
to be involved in my life.

00:18.550 --> 00:21.151
It's not that easy
to just quit drinking.

00:21.186 --> 00:22.353
Your mother was
a lovely woman.

00:22.387 --> 00:24.321
And she was
an alcoholic.

00:24.356 --> 00:26.123
And I'm afraid that
if you start drinking,

00:26.157 --> 00:27.224
you could be
one of those people.

00:27.259 --> 00:29.326
You seem slightly more
mature than Grace.

00:29.361 --> 00:31.328
Which is why
I like you and trust you.

00:31.363 --> 00:33.397
Would you maybe like to go out
of the house without the kids

00:33.431 --> 00:35.165
next Saturday night?

00:35.200 --> 00:37.368
Adrian is hoping to get Ben
to get her pregnant again.

00:37.402 --> 00:38.469
What is she thinking?

00:38.503 --> 00:40.571
We are married.

00:40.605 --> 00:43.207
So, we can have sex
if we want to.

00:43.241 --> 00:44.241
Of course we can.

00:44.276 --> 00:45.409
You're a wonderful man.

00:45.443 --> 00:47.177
It's the best time
I've ever had.

00:47.212 --> 00:49.146
This was really nice
of Daniel to do this.

00:49.180 --> 00:50.481
He'd do anything
for me.

00:50.515 --> 00:52.383
I would never do anything
to hurt you again.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.551
Someone might be
coming by to see you.

00:54.586 --> 00:56.553
Who?

00:56.588 --> 00:59.290
I'm Nora,
and I'm an alcoholic.

01:00.592 --> 01:03.427
You mean now?
You wanna get pregnant now?

01:03.595 --> 01:05.095
Yes.

01:05.129 --> 01:06.430
But, Adrian,
you're back in school.

01:06.464 --> 01:08.532
You've got your life going
in another direction now.

01:08.566 --> 01:11.201
You've made a lot of
positive changes

01:11.236 --> 01:12.369
in the past
couple of months.

01:12.404 --> 01:13.504
Yeah.

01:13.538 --> 01:15.372
And the next
positive change is

01:15.407 --> 01:16.573
that I want to
get pregnant again.

01:16.608 --> 01:18.442
You and Ben want to
get pregnant again?

01:18.476 --> 01:20.110
He doesn't know yet.

01:20.145 --> 01:21.545
Unless Grace told him.
I haven't told him.

01:21.579 --> 01:23.113
I see.

01:23.148 --> 01:24.548
No, no,
you don't see.

01:24.582 --> 01:27.351
Look, I can't just expect Ben
to want another baby right now.

01:27.385 --> 01:29.219
No, I don't think you can.

01:29.254 --> 01:32.323
And what if he doesn't want to have
another baby right now? Then...

01:33.224 --> 01:34.558
I want a baby.

01:34.592 --> 01:37.227
I need a baby.

01:37.262 --> 01:41.131
And I don't know what his
initial reaction would be,

01:41.166 --> 01:42.566
but he was okay with it
last time.

01:43.335 --> 01:45.169
Eventually.

01:45.203 --> 01:49.206
And once I do
get pregnant,

01:49.240 --> 01:50.407
then everything
will be like it was.

01:50.442 --> 01:52.242
Like it was?
Yes.

01:52.277 --> 01:53.477
How was it?
We were happy.

01:54.579 --> 01:56.180
We were very happy.

01:56.214 --> 01:59.383
I think you made the best
of a bad situation.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.118
Both of you.

02:01.152 --> 02:04.088
You seemed to
accept each other,

02:04.122 --> 02:05.489
and forgive each other.

02:05.523 --> 02:07.358
You were both
very responsible.

02:07.392 --> 02:11.161
You took very good care of yourself
and very good care of the baby.

02:11.196 --> 02:14.331
And I imagine
that your life felt

02:15.333 --> 02:17.534
a certainty, a security.

02:18.403 --> 02:20.237
You felt grown up.

02:20.572 --> 02:23.073
Yes. Exactly.

02:23.108 --> 02:26.543
But the life that you thought you
were going to have has changed.

02:26.578 --> 02:31.348
Which is why I'm going to change
it back to what it was before.

02:31.383 --> 02:33.484
What it was
supposed to be.

02:33.518 --> 02:37.454
I want things to be the way I
thought they were going to be.

02:37.489 --> 02:38.522
That's my plan.

02:38.556 --> 02:41.358
What if you have
a new plan?

02:41.393 --> 02:43.260
A "you" plan?

02:43.294 --> 02:46.330
Where you make grown-up
decisions for yourself,

02:46.364 --> 02:48.298
the way you did when you were
taking care of the baby?

02:48.333 --> 02:49.466
Why don't you
make a plan

02:49.501 --> 02:52.403
where you focus on you,
and you put yourself first?

02:52.437 --> 02:53.470
That's my plan now.

02:53.505 --> 02:56.340
No, your plan
involves a baby.

02:56.374 --> 02:58.342
And a husband.

02:58.376 --> 02:59.476
And you're 18.

03:01.379 --> 03:03.347
I know
it sounds cliche.

03:03.381 --> 03:08.118
But, Adrian, you have your entire
adult life in front of you.

03:08.153 --> 03:10.220
You know, if I was 30,
you wouldn't be coming up

03:10.255 --> 03:11.488
with this whole
"me" plan right now.

03:11.523 --> 03:14.124
You would be telling me
to try again.

03:14.159 --> 03:15.225
With my husband.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.362
But you're not 30,
you're 18.

03:18.396 --> 03:20.164
You're living in a condo.

03:20.198 --> 03:21.365
You're married.

03:21.399 --> 03:24.268
You're trying to have a
baby to save a marriage

03:24.302 --> 03:26.303
that you never really wanted
in the first place.

03:26.337 --> 03:29.173
Another pregnancy at 18?

03:29.207 --> 03:31.241
Another baby?
A marriage?

03:31.276 --> 03:34.078
Adrian, you are
too smart for this.

03:34.112 --> 03:36.180
You are a beautiful
young woman.

03:36.214 --> 03:39.216
You're ambitious,
you're determined.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.485
Dream a new dream.
Go for it!

03:45.190 --> 03:46.223
Yeah.

03:46.257 --> 03:47.291
Yeah.

03:47.325 --> 03:51.228
Oh, my God.
I am only 18.

03:51.262 --> 03:53.230
And I'm married and
I'm living in a condo

03:53.264 --> 03:55.099
and I'm trying to have a
baby to keep my husband

03:55.133 --> 03:56.366
and a marriage that I
would've never wanted

03:56.401 --> 03:58.302
if I hadn't
been pregnant,

03:58.336 --> 04:01.438
when I should be going after
what I really want in life.

04:01.473 --> 04:04.141
And I still have plenty of time
to get what I really want.

04:04.175 --> 04:05.375
That's right.

04:05.410 --> 04:09.246
Your career,
your education.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.282
Your independence,
your freedom.

04:12.317 --> 04:13.383
Your own life!

04:13.418 --> 04:14.451
And Ricky.

04:16.286 --> 04:18.255
I'm going after Ricky.

04:18.289 --> 04:20.390
Thank you, Dr. Ottavi.
Thank you.

04:24.295 --> 04:25.429
Ricky?

04:25.463 --> 04:26.655
Who the hell
is Ricky?

I had left.
I came back.

04:47.639 --> 04:48.973
But you're leaving again.

04:49.007 --> 04:52.610
At the end of the summer,
high school finishes

04:52.644 --> 04:53.811
and when I start
my senior year.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.546
Which she agreed to.

04:55.580 --> 04:58.516
Yes, she agreed
to that plan,

04:58.550 --> 05:00.551
all the while having
her secret plan

05:00.585 --> 05:01.719
to get me to
get her pregnant again.

05:01.753 --> 05:02.853
Does she know
that you know?

05:02.888 --> 05:04.855
No, no,
anything about it.

05:04.890 --> 05:06.524
Because?

05:06.558 --> 05:08.526
Because my dad's the one
who told me,

05:08.560 --> 05:10.528
and I don't need to
that I know.now

05:10.562 --> 05:14.632
Maybe you should
for discussion.ring it up

05:14.666 --> 05:17.535
It seems a little dangerous
don't you think?,

05:20.939 --> 05:22.773
She's going through
a tough time,

05:22.808 --> 05:24.742
and, well, she's kind of
getting on Shakur's nerves.

05:24.776 --> 05:27.411
I've never seen anyone
get on Shakur's nerves.

05:27.446 --> 05:29.847
Oh? Well,
that happens sometimes.

05:29.881 --> 05:31.882
You sure she's not
getting on your nerves?

05:31.917 --> 05:34.785
My nerves?
You know me.

05:34.820 --> 05:36.887
Yeah, I know you,
and I know Dad.

05:36.922 --> 05:38.723
And if someone's getting
on someone's nerves,

05:38.757 --> 05:39.890
it's almost always
your nerves.

05:39.925 --> 05:42.693
Okay, it's me.

05:42.728 --> 05:45.896
I just want some time alone
with my husband.

05:45.931 --> 05:48.599
Just a couple
of nights alone

05:48.633 --> 05:50.901
where we have
the house to ourselves.

05:50.936 --> 05:54.438
Uh, it's our anniversary,

05:54.473 --> 05:57.541
and Shakur called
to surprise me,

05:57.576 --> 06:00.544
and to tell me that
he's taking tomorrow off.

06:00.579 --> 06:03.614
And I just want
to have a nice dinner,

06:03.648 --> 06:07.685
alone, at home,
just the two of us.

06:07.719 --> 06:10.421
I thought your
the holidays.as around

06:10.889 --> 06:12.456
You remembered that?

06:12.491 --> 06:13.557
December 23rd.

06:13.592 --> 06:15.726
Okay, I'm lying.

06:15.761 --> 06:19.430
But I do want that time
with my husband.

06:19.464 --> 06:21.565
And he does have
the time off.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.601
But we don't have room for her.
Where would she sleep?

06:23.635 --> 06:26.837
Well, maybe Nora can stay
at your apartment,

06:26.872 --> 06:29.507
and you and Amy could stay
at her parents' house.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.509
Or maybe the four of you could
stay at her parents' house.

06:31.543 --> 06:33.544
It's just gonna be
for a couple of nights.

06:33.578 --> 06:34.812
All right.
I'll make it happen.

06:34.846 --> 06:36.747
Happy fake anniversary.

06:40.819 --> 06:42.787
Hi, Margaret.
Hi.

06:43.555 --> 06:44.622
Hi, John.

06:44.856 --> 06:45.890
Hi.

06:47.659 --> 06:50.594
I just dropped by
for a little favor.

06:50.629 --> 06:51.729
It's good to see you.

06:51.763 --> 06:52.730
It's good to see you, too.
You want to come up?

06:52.764 --> 06:54.765
Oh, no, no, no.
That's okay.

06:54.800 --> 06:55.933
Talk to you later, Son?

06:59.805 --> 07:02.540
Aw, that's nice.

07:02.574 --> 07:04.441
She calls you Son.
I like that.

07:04.476 --> 07:06.844
She needs us to
a couple of nights.over

07:06.878 --> 07:08.813
Oh, yeah, sure,
that'd be fun.

07:08.847 --> 07:10.848
It'd be like having a little
family sleepover or something.

07:10.882 --> 07:13.384
I don't think it'd be fun.
Where's she gonna sleep?

07:13.418 --> 07:15.719
Um, well, we can sleep on the floor.
She can have our sofa bed.

07:15.754 --> 07:19.523
Or we could sleep over at your parents'
house and she could stay here.

07:19.558 --> 07:21.725
I don't think she should
be alone right now.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.794
I think she's still
really down about,

07:23.829 --> 07:25.693
you know,
what happened with Ben.

07:25.697 --> 07:27.181
That's what you're calling
her getting drunk?

07:27.206 --> 07:28.406
"What happened with Ben"?

07:28.466 --> 07:29.633
It wasn't Ben's fault,
you know.

07:29.668 --> 07:31.635
I know that.
But still,

07:31.670 --> 07:34.638
I think it'd be really nice
to spend some time with her.

07:35.807 --> 07:37.575
We can all stay
at my parents' house.

07:37.609 --> 07:38.676
Yeah, let's do that.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.678
My dad's still at my mom's.

07:40.712 --> 07:43.480
And I think things are going
really well with the two of them.

07:43.515 --> 07:45.783
You know, I think that you should
go out and get a job. Any job.

07:45.817 --> 07:47.518
I have a job.
I own the furniture store.

07:47.552 --> 07:49.420
It's a passive income,
best job in the world.

07:49.454 --> 07:50.521
Did you see Donovan today?

07:50.555 --> 07:51.856
Yes. I did.

07:51.890 --> 07:55.626
And you know what? Your job is easy,
but my job is not easy.

07:55.660 --> 07:57.561
And you're getting
a lot of business from me,

07:57.596 --> 07:59.763
and I've been working my butt
off to make my business work,

07:59.798 --> 08:01.432
which is making
your business work,

08:01.466 --> 08:02.733
so, I think that
you should get out there

08:02.767 --> 08:04.535
and start working
your butt off, too.

08:04.569 --> 08:06.437
Because I'm getting
a little bit tired

08:06.471 --> 08:08.505
of your vacationing
at my condo,

08:08.540 --> 08:10.407
and doing all the things
with Robie

08:10.442 --> 08:11.775
that I would like to be doing
with Robie if I weren't working.

08:11.810 --> 08:13.510
And with my mother.

08:13.545 --> 08:15.546
I mean, I'd like to be
playing bingo

08:15.580 --> 08:18.549
and tap dancing
and finger-painting,

08:18.583 --> 08:19.817
d swim lessons,
and all that other bull...

08:19.851 --> 08:21.719
Hey, hey!
What's going on?

08:21.753 --> 08:24.488
We were having a perfectly
nice time here and then, bam!

08:24.522 --> 08:25.789
Relax. I've got a filet
mignon in the oven

08:25.824 --> 08:27.458
that's been
marinating all day,

08:27.492 --> 08:28.759
a bottle of cabernet
that's breathing.

08:28.793 --> 08:31.428
Yeah, and I've got a headache
from sitting in traffic.

08:31.463 --> 08:34.732
And all I can think about is
how your business is booming,

08:34.765 --> 08:36.833
and how you're making
all this money,

08:36.868 --> 08:39.535
when it's my idea
in the first place.

08:39.571 --> 08:41.605
Turning your retail store
into a redesign store.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.573
I should have started
that business myself.

08:43.607 --> 08:44.708
Yeah, but you didn't.
And I did have

08:44.743 --> 08:46.543
a successful business
in the first place.

08:46.578 --> 08:47.544
You know, I've had that
place for over 20 years.

08:47.579 --> 08:49.413
You know what?

08:49.447 --> 08:52.516
I want to be partners in
that business, in the store.

08:52.550 --> 08:54.551
Okay, well, I'd like to
have the house back, then.

08:54.586 --> 08:56.420
That was the deal.
You get the house, I get the business.

08:56.454 --> 08:59.623
But you took my idea and turned the
business into another business.

08:59.658 --> 09:01.558
And you're
living in my house.

09:01.593 --> 09:02.660
Taking care of
your daughters.

09:02.694 --> 09:05.562
Our daughters,
who don't live there.

09:05.597 --> 09:07.598
Okay, Anne, calm down,
I'll talk to Donovan about it

09:07.632 --> 09:08.699
and see how
he feels about it.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.634
Don't tell me
to calm down.

09:10.669 --> 09:13.704
Donovan runs the business.
He doesn't own the business.

09:13.738 --> 09:15.506
You pay him
to run the business.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.640
So, why would you
have to ask Donovan

09:16.675 --> 09:19.410
if you can make your wife
a partner in the store?

09:19.444 --> 09:21.712
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

09:21.746 --> 09:23.547
You made him
a partner in the business!

09:23.581 --> 09:25.616
Okay, you found out.
Yes.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.384
I don't believe this.

09:27.419 --> 09:28.485
I'm not saying you can't
be a partner, too.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.387
It's just,
I'd have to ask first.

09:30.422 --> 09:31.488
You know what
the problem is?

09:31.523 --> 09:33.624
Me?
You and me.

09:33.658 --> 09:36.493
We're not married,
but we're not not married.

09:36.528 --> 09:38.796
I came up here and I started
a new life for myself,

09:38.830 --> 09:40.464
and a new business for myself,

09:40.498 --> 09:41.732
and I was
perfectly content

09:41.766 --> 09:43.701
living here with Robie,
near Mimsy,

09:43.735 --> 09:45.669
seeing the girls
every other weekend.

09:45.704 --> 09:51.442
And then you show up, and suddenly
I'm feeling confused, and unhappy,

09:51.476 --> 09:52.776
and unsure of myself.

09:55.447 --> 09:57.781
I think I just
need to be alone.

09:57.816 --> 10:00.551
I'm sorry, George, but I really
just need to spend some time alone,

10:00.585 --> 10:02.519
so, you have to go.

10:02.821 --> 10:04.455
Now.

10:04.489 --> 10:05.589
But dinner's gonna
be ready in 20 minutes!

10:07.459 --> 10:09.660
Can't I just eat first?

10:09.694 --> 10:10.694
And you said
there was traffic.

10:10.729 --> 10:11.895
I don't want to
drive in traffic.

10:14.766 --> 10:17.568
I guess we got married because
we needed each other.

10:17.602 --> 10:19.470
And...

10:19.504 --> 10:21.705
I guess what I'm
saying now is that

10:21.740 --> 10:23.507
even with all
the stupid things

10:23.541 --> 10:24.842
we've said and done
over the past few weeks,

10:24.876 --> 10:26.810
we still need each other,

10:26.845 --> 10:28.746
and we probably
always will.

10:28.780 --> 10:32.449
I mean, we lost a baby
together, for crying out loud.

10:32.484 --> 10:34.785
You'll always have
that in common.

10:34.819 --> 10:37.554
But I'm not sure that means
you'll always need each other.

10:38.890 --> 10:41.658
Why do you need Adrian?

10:41.693 --> 10:44.762
Why have you decided you don't
want out at this point?

10:44.796 --> 10:46.897
Why do you need
to be in this relationship?

10:52.504 --> 10:53.904
I'm sorry.
This could be an emergency.

10:57.509 --> 10:58.842
Are you okay?
I need to talk to you.

10:58.877 --> 11:01.612
I'm talking to Dr.
Fields right now. Can it wait?

11:01.646 --> 11:05.582
Oh, I wasn't aware that you had
an appointment with Dr. Fields.

11:05.617 --> 11:06.850
Sorry.

11:06.885 --> 11:09.553
But come home as soon as you can.
Bye.

11:13.425 --> 11:14.792
Speak of the devil.

11:16.494 --> 11:17.895
Adrian needs me.
I have to go.

11:18.897 --> 11:20.798
And was it
an emergency?

11:20.832 --> 11:22.433
She needs to talk to me.

11:23.802 --> 11:25.436
Maybe she's ovulating.

11:27.639 --> 11:29.606
Come on, lighten up.

11:29.641 --> 11:32.543
We're not gonna
get pregnant.

11:32.577 --> 11:33.877
We're not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.074

11:48.067 --> 11:48.943
Hey, Adrian.

11:48.944 --> 11:51.480
You almost let me do the stupidest
thing I could have ever done.

11:51.481 --> 11:52.882
<i>What?</i>
<i>You almost let me get pregnant again.</i>

11:52.916 --> 11:56.586
No, I didn't! That was not my
decision, and I told you...

11:56.620 --> 11:57.887
You didn't tell Ben,
did you?

11:57.921 --> 11:59.555
No.
Did you tell anyone?

11:59.856 --> 12:01.657
No.
Why not?

12:01.692 --> 12:03.726
Because I...
I just didn't.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.495
Well, I'm definitely not
getting pregnant.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.364
I'm going
the opposite route.

12:08.398 --> 12:09.498
I'm leaving Ben.

12:09.533 --> 12:11.534
Or I'm letting
Ben leave me.

12:11.568 --> 12:15.504
Okay, yeah, that's
nice of you, I guess.

12:15.539 --> 12:16.772
Isn't he leaving
at the end of the summer?

12:16.807 --> 12:18.474
Yeah, but now he
doesn't have to wait.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.776
He can leave tonight
if he wants to,

12:20.811 --> 12:23.379
or tomorrow,
or this weekend.

12:23.413 --> 12:24.447
Yeah, the sooner,
the better.

12:24.481 --> 12:25.481
Did something happen?

12:25.515 --> 12:26.816
Yeah.
I had an epiphany.

12:26.850 --> 12:28.718
Are you sure it
wasn't just an orgasm?

12:28.752 --> 12:30.886
Huh?
Sorry. That was a joke.

12:31.722 --> 12:32.788
Should I ask what?

12:32.823 --> 12:34.523
You can ask,
but I'm not saying.

12:34.558 --> 12:36.559
Oh, jeez. So it's something
I'm not gonna like?

12:36.593 --> 12:37.793
I don't care
if you like it.

12:37.828 --> 12:39.462
I don't care
if anyone likes it.

12:39.496 --> 12:40.796
I'm gonna live for me,

12:40.831 --> 12:42.431
and I'm gonna get
what I want.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.834
Ricky?

12:52.676 --> 12:54.710
Oh. Yeah.

12:54.745 --> 12:57.546
Margaret dropped me off.
We had a little fight.

12:57.581 --> 12:58.748
I'm sorry.
Well, come on in.

12:58.782 --> 12:59.815
We were just gonna
order a pizza.

12:59.850 --> 13:02.618
Oh, great.
Teen food. Yeah.

13:02.653 --> 13:04.754
I love being
babysat by teens.

13:04.788 --> 13:06.522
Including my own teen.

13:06.556 --> 13:08.658
This isn't humiliating
or anything for me.

13:08.692 --> 13:10.593
I wasn't
looking at it like that.

13:10.627 --> 13:12.728
I'm just excited to spend
some time together.

13:12.763 --> 13:14.597
Where's the kid?
John's going to bed.

13:14.631 --> 13:16.465
It's his bedtime.
I meant Ricky.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.601
Oh, he's putting him down.

13:18.635 --> 13:19.669
So, where am I sleeping?

13:19.703 --> 13:21.404
Well, you can have
Ashley's bedroom.

13:24.441 --> 13:25.574
Huh.

13:25.609 --> 13:27.576
I think I'll
go to bed now, too.

13:27.611 --> 13:28.811
Good night.
No, no. Guys.

13:28.845 --> 13:31.447
Don't do this,
this is good.

13:31.481 --> 13:32.648
The three of us should just
hang out for a while.

13:32.683 --> 13:33.749
It's gonna be fun.

13:33.784 --> 13:35.484
No, it's not.
No, it's not.

13:35.519 --> 13:36.852
Why not? Why does
everything have to be fun?

13:36.887 --> 13:38.487
It is what it is.

13:38.522 --> 13:41.590
If she wants to go to bed,
let her go to bed.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.792
She's right here.
Hi.

13:42.826 --> 13:45.661
Not my fault that you're right there.
Not my idea.

13:45.696 --> 13:48.464
Oh, but it was your idea for me
to live with Margaret and Shakur.

13:48.498 --> 13:49.865
Guys. Yeah, well, if you
don't like my ideas,

13:49.900 --> 13:52.401
you're welcome to come up
with an idea of your own.

13:52.436 --> 13:54.470
Maybe I will.

13:54.504 --> 13:57.540
Okay. You have to go through the
kitchen to get to Ashley's bedroom.

13:57.574 --> 13:58.708
I'll be right there.

14:03.647 --> 14:07.383
I don't like babysitting her any
more than she likes being babysat.

14:07.417 --> 14:10.353
She should stop making the same
mistakes over and over again.

14:10.387 --> 14:12.588
That way, maybe she could be
trusted to be on her own.

14:12.622 --> 14:13.789
All of us should
stop doing that.

14:13.824 --> 14:15.725
What does that mean?

14:15.759 --> 14:17.693
It means that everyone
makes mistakes,

14:17.728 --> 14:19.695
and for some reason,
we keep making them

14:19.730 --> 14:21.731
till we learn whatever it is
that we're supposed to learn.

14:21.765 --> 14:23.399
You mean me,
don't you?

14:23.433 --> 14:24.700
No. I mean everyone.

14:30.474 --> 14:34.543
I just want to apologize for the
way I've been acting lately.

14:34.578 --> 14:37.413
You know, with pressuring you
to have sex and everything.

14:37.447 --> 14:39.415
Oh, hey, it's okay.

14:39.449 --> 14:41.684
You're still my wife
and you can pressure me.

14:41.718 --> 14:44.854
No, I don't want to pressure
you about anything.

14:46.423 --> 14:51.394
But I would like you to

14:51.428 --> 14:54.697
go ahead and
move out of the condo.

14:55.832 --> 14:57.800
Not when I graduate.
Now.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.635
What? Well, you were
gonna move anyway.

14:59.669 --> 15:01.704
At the end of the summer.
Maybe.

15:01.738 --> 15:03.606
Not maybe, that was
definitely the plan.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.673
Plans change.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.342
Exactly.

15:06.376 --> 15:08.611
That's why I want you
to move. Now.

15:08.645 --> 15:10.679
I don't think
I want to move now.

15:10.714 --> 15:12.648
This is my condo, too.

15:12.682 --> 15:15.551
I know.
But it's for the best.

15:16.453 --> 15:17.520
I need you to leave.

15:17.554 --> 15:18.687
Why do you
need me to leave?

15:18.722 --> 15:21.457
So I can be by myself.
I need to be by myself.

15:21.491 --> 15:24.660
Maybe I don't want to leave.
Maybe I want to stay.

15:24.694 --> 15:27.329
You already left.
Just leave again.

15:27.364 --> 15:28.731
Only this time,
you can stay gone.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.700
Look, we both know
it's over.

15:31.735 --> 15:33.602
We're done.

15:33.637 --> 15:36.338
It's been great, it's been not great.
It's over.

15:36.373 --> 15:38.607
I think this is the least sensitive
break-up I've ever been through.

15:38.642 --> 15:40.443
No, I think you
still have me beat

15:40.477 --> 15:41.677
with that whole screaming thing you
did followed by getting drunk.

15:41.711 --> 15:43.646
I thought you
accepted my apology,

15:43.680 --> 15:47.716
and I've felt definitely better
since I exploded like that.

15:47.751 --> 15:50.486
You leave if you want to leave.
I'm not leaving.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.688
But you were gonna leave when
school starts again anyway.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.390
School isn't even over yet!

15:54.424 --> 15:56.459
I know.

15:56.493 --> 15:59.328
Look, just do what's
best for you and leave.

15:59.362 --> 16:02.264
You, you need to have
a "you" plan.

16:02.299 --> 16:06.635
You need to focus on you,
your career, your life.

16:06.670 --> 16:08.471
You never even wanted
to live here.

16:08.505 --> 16:09.672
And now you don't have to
live here.

16:09.706 --> 16:10.706
Not even for another day.

16:12.609 --> 16:16.512
So, just go home to your big
house, and your bedroom,

16:16.546 --> 16:18.714
and all those things
that you love.

16:18.748 --> 16:21.584
The driver,
the housekeeper,

16:22.586 --> 16:23.619
the chef.

16:24.754 --> 16:27.356
The gardeners,
the pool man.

16:29.593 --> 16:30.626
Your bear,

16:32.395 --> 16:33.729
your dad and Betty.

16:34.731 --> 16:36.432
Go, Ben.

16:36.466 --> 16:38.567
Go and live the life
you always dreamed about.

16:38.602 --> 16:40.503
I wasn't dreaming.

16:40.537 --> 16:42.771
That was my life,
and now this is my life.

16:42.806 --> 16:45.508
But this isn't
the life you wanted, Ben.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.776
And I should've never
tried to hold on to you.

16:47.811 --> 16:51.514
Oh, is that right?

16:51.548 --> 16:54.550
And what if you had
gotten pregnant again?

16:54.584 --> 16:57.553
What if you had somehow
managed to seduce me

16:57.587 --> 16:59.488
and get pregnant again,
like you planned?

17:01.391 --> 17:03.726
Would you still be trying to
kick me out of my own condo?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.627
Excuse me?
Our condo.

17:05.662 --> 17:07.663
The other part.
Oh, please.

17:07.696 --> 17:09.431
I know, all right?

17:10.534 --> 17:12.468
My dad told me.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.303
Ricky told him.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.672
Yeah. How about that, huh?
Ricky. Yeah.

17:18.441 --> 17:20.643
Ricky found out from Amy,
Amy found out from Grace,

17:20.676 --> 17:22.578
who found out from you.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.648
So, I knew.
Yeah, I knew.

17:26.683 --> 17:28.483
And you know what?

17:28.518 --> 17:30.419
I'm not going anywhere until
I'm good and ready to go.

17:30.453 --> 17:31.754
You want to go,
you go.

17:31.788 --> 17:36.559
In fact, I'm going
to have some friends over.

17:36.593 --> 17:38.460
Yeah.
That's what I'm going to do.

17:38.495 --> 17:41.664
Because that's what I feel like
doing, and this is my condo, too.

17:47.337 --> 17:49.672
Hi, Adrian.
I'm actually studying.

17:49.706 --> 17:51.740
Well, study this,
big mouth.

17:51.775 --> 17:54.510
You told Amy I was planning
on getting pregnant?

17:54.544 --> 17:57.379
Um, I don't recall.

17:57.414 --> 18:01.483
She told Ricky, and he told Mr.
Boykewich, and he told Ben!

18:01.518 --> 18:03.352
I don't know
anything about that.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.453
And why do you even
care anyway?

18:04.487 --> 18:05.721
You aren't even interested
in Ben anymore.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.389
So what difference
does it make?

18:07.424 --> 18:08.691
Oh, I'll tell you
the difference it makes.

18:08.725 --> 18:10.593
You and I,
we're not friends anymore.

18:11.294 --> 18:12.394
Fine.

18:29.379 --> 18:30.879
Hello?

18:30.914 --> 18:33.382
<i>Amy, I just think you should know</i>
<i>that Adrian is going after Ricky.</i>

18:33.416 --> 18:34.483
She told Ben to
move out of the condo,

18:34.517 --> 18:36.385
and she's going after Ricky.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.453
Your Ricky.

18:48.315 --> 18:49.449
Crazy woman.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.263
She actually tried to
kick me out of here.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.232
Like my dad didn't
buy this place.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.333
It is a nice place.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.068
But this is what you wanted.
To get out.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.036
I said I'd get out
at the end of the summer.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.304
So you get out
a little early.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.173
Are you taking her side? No.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.374
I'm not going anywhere.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.043
Again, my father
bought this condo for us.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.179
What?

19:07.213 --> 19:09.214
Well, that argument would
be slightly more effective

19:09.249 --> 19:11.116
and have a higher
testosterone level

19:11.151 --> 19:13.152
if you said
you bought this condo.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.319
Henry.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.321
I'm just saying.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.056
You'd continue
this arrangement

19:18.091 --> 19:19.124
after telling us
and everyone else

19:19.159 --> 19:20.492
you'd do anything
to get out?

19:20.527 --> 19:23.429
Yeah, well,
I don't know.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.265
Okay. After I found out that
Adrian was trying to trick me into

19:26.299 --> 19:28.066
having another baby,

19:28.101 --> 19:29.468
I started thinking
about it, and...

19:29.502 --> 19:31.437
No!
Alice.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.072
She was trying to trick you
into having another baby?

19:34.107 --> 19:35.207
Do you hear
what you're saying?

19:35.241 --> 19:37.042
You want to stay
fake-married to a woman

19:37.076 --> 19:39.111
trying to trick you
into having another baby?

19:39.145 --> 19:40.345
I don't want to
have another baby,

19:40.380 --> 19:44.516
but it was somehow
flattering to me

19:44.551 --> 19:48.253
that Adrian would go to such
lengths to keep me here.

19:48.288 --> 19:51.523
And now it's...
Well, it's just painful

19:51.558 --> 19:54.426
to know that she doesn't
really care about me at all,

19:54.461 --> 19:56.195
and wants me out.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.331
I want a drink.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.267
Right.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.504
I guess I should just
pack my things and leave.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.209
Maybe you should
talk to Adrian.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.512
Or maybe, since she's the one who
left, maybe she won't come back.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.081
No, she told me to
sleep on it

20:16.115 --> 20:18.150
and that she'd be back
tomorrow to help me pack.

20:18.184 --> 20:21.487
No, no, you're not leaving,
and you're not drinking.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.422
You stay right here
until you're ready to leave.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.190
She doesn't get to
make all the decisions.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.758
Henry.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.428
I know it was a shock, Ben, but you
want to stay here? Really? With Adrian?

20:29.462 --> 20:30.529
I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.130
Maybe you should
both leave.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.265
I don't know.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.434
I feel a little too old
to go home to Daddy.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.202
Ben, you're not
even 18 yet.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.204
You're not even
a senior in high school yet.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.073
And you're married and
you're living in a condo

20:41.107 --> 20:44.109
with a woman who tried to get
pregnant just to hold on to you,

20:44.143 --> 20:46.111
and a marriage neither of
you ever really wanted.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.281
You're a nice guy, Ben.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.283
You're good-looking, you're
smart, and you're funny,

20:51.317 --> 20:53.385
and, well,
you're loaded.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.320
You've got
every opportunity

20:55.355 --> 20:57.322
to do anything in the world
that you want to do.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.390
Do you really want
to stay here

20:58.424 --> 21:01.293
when you don't
have to stay here?

21:01.327 --> 21:03.195
This will be your last
summer in high school.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.163
You should do whatever you
want to do this summer.

21:05.198 --> 21:08.200
Enjoy yourself for once, without
trying to save some girl.

21:08.234 --> 21:12.104
This one, or the old
one, or a new one.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.506
Did you just call Amy
Juergens "the old one"?

21:14.541 --> 21:17.142
Yes.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.144
I don't know why, but
that just makes me laugh.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.146
You think that's why Adrian
suddenly wants you out?

21:21.414 --> 21:23.148
What?
Ricky?

21:40.533 --> 21:42.134
Adrian?

21:45.104 --> 21:46.171
Hi.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.372
Hi.

21:47.407 --> 21:50.075
It's good to see you

21:50.109 --> 21:52.544
at 9:00 at night
on a school night.

21:52.579 --> 21:57.215
I just missed this house,
and you, and Mom, and...

21:57.250 --> 21:59.284
Well, I just want to spend
the night in my old room.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.119
Did you have a fight
with Ben?

22:02.388 --> 22:05.257
Dad, um,

22:05.291 --> 22:08.393
we decided that we don't
want to be married anymore.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.428
Ben's moving out.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.096
Oh, no, he's not.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.197
No, he is.
I asked him to.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.232
No, you didn't.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.234
I did.
I want him to move out.

22:16.269 --> 22:18.236
No, you do not
want him to move out.

22:18.271 --> 22:19.338
No, I do.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.173
No, you do not.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.275
You do not want to be
18 and divorced.

22:23.309 --> 22:26.044
No, I do not want
to be 18 and married.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.212
But you are married.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.449
What were you doing
when I came in?

22:30.483 --> 22:32.484
Nothing.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.052
Yeah, you were staring out the
window towards the Juergens' house.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.687
So what?

22:35.722 --> 22:39.057
So what is that I noticed that Ricky and
Amy are over at the Juergens' house.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.225
Both their cars are there.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.063
Ricky?

22:49.369 --> 22:50.435
Yeah!

22:53.473 --> 22:55.374
Take off, buddy,
you know the drill.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.411
Hey. What ya doing in my house?
Hey.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.446
Ricky and Amy are
babysitting me.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.985
Technically this is
the garage, I believe.

23:07.020 --> 23:09.187
Yeah, I created this for Sugar Plum.
Ashley.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.123
Then she hit the road.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.058
I thought you were in your
love nest in Palm Springs.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.292
What happened?
Eh, what always happens.

23:14.327 --> 23:16.094
She got tired of me
and kicked me out.

23:16.129 --> 23:17.195
She'll come
scratching around again

23:17.230 --> 23:18.997
when she needs me.
And she'll need me.

23:19.032 --> 23:20.132
Okay.
Where are the kids?

23:20.166 --> 23:22.100
Oh, they're putting
the baby to bed.

23:22.135 --> 23:26.171
Oh, my jailers needed
the house to themselves,

23:26.205 --> 23:28.073
and I had no place to
go except Ricky's.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.174
Ricky's place
is too small.

23:29.208 --> 23:32.144
So, basically,
we're all sacrificing

23:32.178 --> 23:37.182
for the anniversary of two of the
dullest people I've ever met.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.418
Maybe that's what Anne and I
were missing, the dull factor.

23:39.452 --> 23:41.053
Or me, anyway.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.087
I was never really
good at being married.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.156
As much time as you
spend in Palm Springs,

23:44.190 --> 23:46.224
it doesn't sound like you're very
good at being divorced, either.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.459
Eh, when you
have children...

23:47.493 --> 23:49.161
Yeah, when you
have children...

23:50.129 --> 23:53.098
So, uh, you still...

23:53.132 --> 23:54.366
Working at
the butcher shop?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.101
Is that what they call it? No.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.269
I don't know how
that girl stuff works.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.971
I'll get you a book, okay?
A picture book.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.073
Thanks.
I like to read.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.141
I can take it or leave it.

24:03.176 --> 24:06.445
Basically that's why I didn't want to be
married to Miss Smarty-Pants Attorney.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.114
So, that's off?

24:09.148 --> 24:10.982
Yeah.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.250
I'm not the marrying type.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.019
We got a lot in common.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.487
And yet not enough.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.193
Adrian?
I don't know Adrian.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.095
Was that Adrian?
What's she doing here?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.298
Ricky!

24:26.332 --> 24:27.365
No!

24:33.339 --> 24:35.240
I don't know what
she's doing here.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.383
Adrian. Hi.

24:45.418 --> 24:47.352
Hi.

24:47.386 --> 24:52.057
Uh, I was just next door
at my parents' house,

24:52.091 --> 24:55.093
and my dad came home and said
you guys were over here.

24:55.128 --> 24:56.428
So, I thought I'd
come say hi.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.198
Yeah, okay. Um...

25:01.267 --> 25:02.367
Come on in.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.170
Thank you.

25:12.945 --> 25:18.049
So, it's been
a crazy night.

25:18.084 --> 25:23.021
Ben and I had a big fight,
and it's finally over.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.257
We both knew
it wouldn't last,

25:26.359 --> 25:28.293
and now it's really over,

25:29.328 --> 25:31.196
and I'm on my own.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.964
Again.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.167
I think I hear John.
Good night, Adrian.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.301
Good night.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.271
Good night.

25:40.173 --> 25:41.273
I'll be right in.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.144
Look, I know what
you're here for.

25:46.179 --> 25:49.381
Uh, other than a little sympathy
from my friends, what am I here for?

25:49.415 --> 25:51.917
Ricky.
Grace told me.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.919
And you know what.
You can't have him.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.154
And you know what else?
He doesn't want you. So don't even try.

25:56.189 --> 25:59.925
I don't have to try.
I can just be me.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.092
I'm now I'm free
to be me.

26:01.127 --> 26:04.162
Adrian, come on!

26:04.197 --> 26:06.298
Just because Ben left you, doesn't
mean you can just run over here

26:06.332 --> 26:07.999
and get Ricky back.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.134
On the same night...

26:09.168 --> 26:12.070
On the same night that
your husband left you!

26:12.104 --> 26:15.040
Come on.
This is just ridiculous.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.343
Oh, he didn't leave me.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.012
I initiated this break-up.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.315
And I initiated
this break-up because...

26:27.220 --> 26:30.989
Well, just check his phone,
you'll find out.

26:55.251 --> 26:56.980
She makes up her mind
that she wants something

26:56.992 --> 26:58.726
and she goes after it
with a vengeance.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.827
Something like me?

26:59.861 --> 27:01.629
It's not funny.
She's vindictive.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.697
This doesn't even
make sense.

27:02.731 --> 27:03.764
No, it does.

27:03.799 --> 27:05.566
She'll go after you
to get back at me

27:05.600 --> 27:06.934
for telling Amy
about Ricky.

27:06.968 --> 27:08.636
And how is she going to know?
Oh, she'll know.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.706
It doesn't matter.
I'm not interested in Adrian.

27:11.740 --> 27:14.775
And I'm really not
interested in this stuff.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.678
Just leave me out of it.

27:17.713 --> 27:21.682
I hope you're left out of it,
but no one escapes. No one!

27:21.717 --> 27:25.820
Okay, a couple more minutes, then
really, Grace, I've got to go.

27:25.854 --> 27:29.590
I've got a paper due tomorrow, and
history isn't my strongest subject.

27:29.624 --> 27:30.791
Let me give you
a clue then.

27:30.826 --> 27:32.626
History repeats itself.

27:32.661 --> 27:33.661
If you haven't heard
that before, it's true.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.496
And in my circle of friends,

27:35.530 --> 27:36.864
it just keeps repeating and
repeating and repeating!

27:36.898 --> 27:38.699
Like you and Jack,
for example?

27:40.635 --> 27:41.802
Hello?
You're right.

27:43.004 --> 27:44.872
I should probably be
talking to Jack.

27:44.906 --> 27:46.741
I mean, you're probably
third in line.

27:46.775 --> 27:48.776
She'll go to Jack first, and
then Grant, and then you.

27:48.810 --> 27:49.810
I should be talking
to Jack.

27:49.845 --> 27:52.880
Hold on.
Finish talking to me first.

27:52.914 --> 27:55.716
Don't let history repeat itself
when it comes to Adrian.

27:55.751 --> 27:57.618
Why don't you all
just gather around Adrian

27:57.652 --> 27:58.986
and tell her that
you care about her,

27:59.020 --> 28:00.921
and you want to
be friends with her.

28:00.956 --> 28:04.525
You sympathize with her loss and
you want to be there for her.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.861
Not like you've been in
the past, but as friends.

28:06.895 --> 28:09.897
As real friends who see that she's
going to try to cause trouble

28:09.931 --> 28:11.766
when she doesn't
need to do that.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.770
Because we're not
that good at being friends.

28:15.804 --> 28:18.539
Yeah, you are.
Or you could be.

28:20.642 --> 28:21.942
Are you still there?

28:21.977 --> 28:24.745
I knew I was in love with you.

28:24.780 --> 28:26.614
Thank you.
You're welcome.

28:26.648 --> 28:27.715
And when you're
talking to Jack,

28:27.749 --> 28:28.983
remember you're in love
with me.

28:29.017 --> 28:31.585
I will. Good night.

28:31.620 --> 28:32.953
Good night? That's it?

28:34.556 --> 28:35.790
I love you.
I love you, too.

28:39.795 --> 28:41.729
Are you off?
Were you listening at my door?

28:41.763 --> 28:42.830
She did call me!

28:42.864 --> 28:43.898
Are you kidding me?

28:43.932 --> 28:45.833
She said she needed
someone to talk to.

28:45.867 --> 28:47.468
ah, I'm sure
that's what she needs.

28:47.502 --> 28:49.470
I, of course, told her
I wouldn't risk it.

28:49.504 --> 28:50.838
I don't want to do
anything to jeopardize

28:50.872 --> 28:52.706
a possible relationship
with you in the future.

28:52.741 --> 28:54.809
You heard everything
else I said.

28:54.843 --> 28:56.510
Didn't you hear
what I just said to Daniel?

28:56.545 --> 28:58.579
Yeah, but you said
the same thing to me.

28:58.613 --> 29:00.648
At the time,
I did love you.

29:00.682 --> 29:02.716
And at another time,
I did love Grant.

29:02.751 --> 29:04.752
And at this time,
I love Daniel.

29:04.786 --> 29:05.853
Okay, whatever.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.888
Should we call Grant?

29:07.923 --> 29:09.757
Yeah. I mean,
you should.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.792
I called him, but I think he
was a little disappointed

29:11.827 --> 29:13.460
that it was me.
And?

29:13.495 --> 29:14.662
Had she called him?
Oh, yeah.

29:14.696 --> 29:16.597
Oh, no. She's angry.

29:16.631 --> 29:19.600
And she will find Daniel,
she will.

29:19.634 --> 29:22.803
But on the other hand, I don't think I
have anything to worry about there.

29:22.838 --> 29:24.872
You never know.
No, you do.

29:24.906 --> 29:26.941
Sometimes you do know.
But I said no.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.709
She found me
and I said no.

29:28.743 --> 29:29.844
Yeah, but it's different
with you.

29:29.878 --> 29:30.878
Because I said yes before?

29:30.912 --> 29:32.813
Exactly.

29:32.848 --> 29:35.616
What is it with her, huh?
With Adrian?

29:35.650 --> 29:38.519
Wh9 does she feel she needs to do
this to her friends and to herself?

29:38.553 --> 29:39.687
Does why matter?

29:39.721 --> 29:41.689
I don't know.
I really don't know.

29:41.723 --> 29:42.756
But this has to stop.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.594
I'm asking you
as her father,

29:46.628 --> 29:48.963
who never gave her the love
she needed growing up.

29:50.699 --> 29:52.499
She needs to
feel loved, Ben.

29:52.534 --> 29:55.936
Well, it's a little difficult
to do that when she doesn't

29:56.805 --> 29:57.905
love

29:58.874 --> 29:59.940
herself.

29:59.975 --> 30:01.942
Exactly.

30:01.977 --> 30:04.645
I mean, what if everyone just
said no to her crazy schemes?

30:04.679 --> 30:06.614
Hmm? What if she
couldn't scheme anymore

30:06.648 --> 30:08.616
because no one
wants to participate?

30:08.650 --> 30:09.884
I think you're talking
to the wrong guy.

30:09.918 --> 30:13.787
The most important "no"
would have to come from Ricky.

30:13.822 --> 30:16.690
Ricky.

30:16.725 --> 30:21.862
Look, all I'm saying is there is
more to Adrian than this nonsense.

30:21.897 --> 30:23.530
She's a complex
young woman,

30:23.565 --> 30:24.665
and she's got a lot
going for her

30:24.699 --> 30:26.600
if she can just drop
this stupid notion

30:26.635 --> 30:27.835
that she belongs
with Ricky.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.571
Yeah, but I don't think
she can, so...

30:32.607 --> 30:34.909
She just walked in.
I'll tell her you called.

30:38.580 --> 30:39.813
It's your dad.
Mmm.

30:41.716 --> 30:44.618
I take it you couldn't find anyone
to play with, so you came home?

30:44.653 --> 30:46.520
All right, let's just
cut to the chase.

30:46.554 --> 30:48.756
I can't help it.
I love him.

30:48.790 --> 30:50.791
Ricky, all right?

30:50.825 --> 30:53.827
And I know you're the better
man, okay? I know that,

30:56.798 --> 30:57.932
but I want to be with Ricky.

30:59.634 --> 31:02.503
I love him.
I've always loved him.

31:03.738 --> 31:07.675
And I want him, and I'm going
to be with him, somehow,

31:08.810 --> 31:09.944
someday.

31:10.845 --> 31:12.880
And everyone knows it.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.782
I told Grace
and I told Amy.

31:17.652 --> 31:20.587
And I told Ricky.

31:20.622 --> 31:22.723
Okay, as long as
we're clear.

31:23.959 --> 31:27.661
Look, maybe you really
do love Ricky,

31:27.696 --> 31:30.731
but, Adrian, I just don't think
it's ever going to work out.

31:31.967 --> 31:33.767
I mean, if he's
such a lousy guy

31:33.802 --> 31:37.538
that he would leave Amy after having
her and his son John move in,

31:38.807 --> 31:41.809
then he's not
good enough for you.

31:41.843 --> 31:43.744
I've spent enough
time with you, Adrian,

31:43.778 --> 31:46.580
to know that
there's enough good in you

31:46.614 --> 31:49.817
that it'll eventually overcome
the not good in you.

31:49.851 --> 31:51.552
But I...

31:52.821 --> 31:54.688
I'm going to do
as you asked.

31:55.924 --> 31:57.524
I'm gonna leave, Adrian.

31:59.594 --> 32:00.928
Tonight.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.496
Now.

32:02.897 --> 32:04.565
I'll

32:05.867 --> 32:07.735
see you at school
tomorrow.

32:08.603 --> 32:10.804
And, uh,

32:12.574 --> 32:13.741
tell your dad
I'm sorry.

32:36.665 --> 32:38.298
I don't know what to say.
Other than...

32:38.609 --> 32:40.952
"I'm glad you have
a prenup"?

32:40.953 --> 32:43.054
Yeah, that would be
one thing to say.

32:43.089 --> 32:45.023
Lesson learned.

32:45.057 --> 32:46.124
Ricky!

32:46.159 --> 32:48.126
She's still in love
with Ricky?

32:48.161 --> 32:51.096
After all that you two
have been through together?

32:51.130 --> 32:52.898
After all you've
done for her?

32:52.932 --> 32:54.166
Don't forget, I wanted out.

32:54.200 --> 32:58.203
And don't forget that I said all
those horrible things to her.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.872
You shouldn't have.
You really shouldn't have.

33:00.907 --> 33:02.107
But in the end,
that's not what did it,

33:02.141 --> 33:03.875
you saying those things
to her.

33:03.910 --> 33:07.045
What did it was that this
marriage was never meant to be.

33:07.079 --> 33:09.080
I really thought
I could make it work,

33:09.115 --> 33:13.251
but without the baby, I just
lost my will to make it work.

33:13.286 --> 33:16.288
And even then, I kept grasping
at ways that it might work.

33:18.191 --> 33:19.991
I'm an idiot.
No, you're not.

33:21.093 --> 33:23.195
You're a nice guy, Ben.
The nicest.

33:23.229 --> 33:24.896
And nice guys
never win.

33:24.931 --> 33:26.998
That's not true.
That's not true at all.

33:27.033 --> 33:28.033
Look at you.

33:28.067 --> 33:31.002
And what does that mean?
Look at him.

33:31.037 --> 33:34.973
He's the sweetest, nicest
guy in the entire universe,

33:35.007 --> 33:36.908
and that's why I love him.

33:39.946 --> 33:41.179
What's going on?

33:41.214 --> 33:43.114
What are you
doing here, Ben?

33:43.916 --> 33:45.116
Is everything okay?

33:46.219 --> 33:49.087
Adrian asked him to leave.
They're splitting up.

33:49.121 --> 33:50.188
What?

33:51.891 --> 33:55.060
Oh! No!
I don't believe that.

33:55.094 --> 33:57.028
Believe it.

33:57.063 --> 33:59.197
Adrian is still in love
with Ricky.

33:59.232 --> 34:02.100
She told me.
She even told Ricky.

34:02.134 --> 34:03.835
It's over, Betty.

34:05.137 --> 34:07.105
That part of my life
is over,

34:09.007 --> 34:11.109
and this part of my life
is not.

34:12.210 --> 34:16.081
Living at home
with Dad and with you.

34:17.116 --> 34:19.184
I guess I'll just
say good night.

34:19.217 --> 34:20.952
Good night.

34:22.221 --> 34:23.989
Good night.

34:29.929 --> 34:33.063
That is just so sad.

34:35.101 --> 34:37.002
A little.

34:37.036 --> 34:39.771
But I don't know,
I feel a little relieved.

34:39.804 --> 34:41.773
Well, would you feel
relieved if we split up?

34:41.806 --> 34:42.908
What are you
talking about?

34:42.942 --> 34:46.811
If I left,
would you feel relieved?

34:46.846 --> 34:48.079
Why are you
asking me that, Betty?

34:48.114 --> 34:49.813
Leo,

34:51.150 --> 34:54.119
I've been around
a lot of men, you know.

34:54.152 --> 34:59.090
So much so that I know
that you're not happy,

34:59.125 --> 35:01.793
not really.

35:01.827 --> 35:03.929
And it's okay.
It's really okay.

35:05.932 --> 35:08.967
If you're not happy,
I can leave.

35:09.001 --> 35:11.002
But, Betty...
But what?

35:11.037 --> 35:14.039
Honey, we have a prenup,

35:14.073 --> 35:18.009
and I would be ecstatic
to just take the money

35:18.044 --> 35:20.011
and say,
"Thank you very much."

35:21.213 --> 35:23.915
And you know
what I would do with it?

35:23.950 --> 35:25.050
I would go to college.

35:26.886 --> 35:29.821
I've always wanted
to go to college.

35:29.855 --> 35:33.959
I always wanted to be an
educated, independent woman,

35:33.993 --> 35:36.161
with a job that has
nothing to do with a man.

35:40.066 --> 35:42.067
I'm gonna talk to Ricky.
No, no, please don't.

35:42.101 --> 35:43.902
I should be the one
to talk to him.

35:43.936 --> 35:45.070
What am I
supposed to say?

35:45.104 --> 35:46.871
"I don't trust you"?

35:46.906 --> 35:49.007
Yeah. Just get it out
in the open.

35:49.041 --> 35:51.076
Or not.
What do I know?

35:51.110 --> 35:52.944
It's late, I'm tired.
I want to go to bed.

35:52.979 --> 35:55.013
Come on, it's 10:00.

35:55.047 --> 35:57.082
What are you
doing home anyway?

35:57.116 --> 36:00.018
Your mother wants to be single at this
particular point in time, so here I am.

36:00.052 --> 36:01.886
What is with
the two of you?

36:01.921 --> 36:03.888
You get divorced and you can't
stay away from each other.

36:03.923 --> 36:05.857
No, we can.
Thus you're speaking to me in person.

36:07.093 --> 36:08.927
I wish I could explain it.

36:08.961 --> 36:10.962
Maybe when you and Ricky have broken
up a few times, you'll understand.

36:10.997 --> 36:12.197
Oh, whoa!
We're not going to break up.

36:12.231 --> 36:14.966
I hope not, Amy.
But I don't think you can not break up

36:15.001 --> 36:17.168
just by not going to your
room and talking to Ricky.

36:17.203 --> 36:20.171
Honestly, I'm on the fence,
but, Amy,

36:20.206 --> 36:21.906
the statistics are against it,

36:21.941 --> 36:23.141
against your relationship
with Ricky working out.

36:23.175 --> 36:25.076
Oh, yeah?

36:25.111 --> 36:28.913
Well, what are the chances
of you and Mom working out?

36:28.948 --> 36:32.083
I mean, what are the statistics
on the third time around

36:32.118 --> 36:35.987
when you both have a baby together
that you didn't plan either?

36:36.022 --> 36:37.756
You'd probably have
a better chance of

36:37.790 --> 36:39.791
being in a relationship
with Ricky's mother.

36:42.828 --> 36:43.928
Her.

36:48.134 --> 36:52.837
Oh, hey! Ho!
I have an idea.

36:52.872 --> 36:53.872
Yeah? Me, too.

36:53.906 --> 36:55.040
I wonder if
it's the same idea.

36:55.074 --> 36:56.941
I don't know.

36:56.976 --> 36:58.843
I just remembered I brought the
meat scraps home for Moose.

36:58.878 --> 37:00.912
We could make meat scrap
sandwiches out of them instead.

37:00.946 --> 37:02.080
I'm hungry.
I'm in.

37:04.150 --> 37:05.784
What was your idea?

37:05.818 --> 37:07.152
Okay. My idea was

37:08.187 --> 37:11.856
maybe I could rent
Ashley's room from you.

37:11.891 --> 37:13.858
You know, just while
she's on the road.

37:13.893 --> 37:15.994
Maybe I could live here.

37:16.028 --> 37:17.095
Yeah, I'd go for it.

37:17.129 --> 37:19.064
You would?

37:19.098 --> 37:21.966
Because all of a sudden, I don't
feel so babysat. I feel...

37:23.936 --> 37:25.870
Like an ex-con
renting a room

37:25.905 --> 37:27.038
while I struggle to
stay sober

37:27.073 --> 37:29.140
after breaking up
with my girlfriend.

37:29.175 --> 37:30.809
That makes it
sound even better.

37:30.843 --> 37:32.110
It's almost
a movie of the week.

37:33.179 --> 37:34.879
You didn't
listen to the message.

37:34.914 --> 37:36.014
I hadn't listened
to the message

37:36.048 --> 37:37.982
when I said I hadn't
listened to the message.

37:38.017 --> 37:39.818
But you have
listened to the message?

37:39.852 --> 37:40.952
Yeah, I listened to it.

37:40.986 --> 37:42.787
And?
And nothing.

37:42.822 --> 37:44.823
Why did you run from the
kitchen when she was here?

37:44.857 --> 37:45.990
Are you hiding something?

37:46.025 --> 37:47.992
No, I'm not.
I'm not hiding anything.

37:48.027 --> 37:50.061
Which doesn't me that you don't
have messages from Adrian.

37:50.096 --> 37:52.030
Text messages
or phone messages

37:52.064 --> 37:53.865
on your phone
from Adrian.

37:53.899 --> 37:55.800
Either you trust me,
or you don't.

37:55.835 --> 37:57.735
That's what this all
comes down to, Amy.

37:57.770 --> 37:58.937
You trust me,
or you don't.

37:58.971 --> 38:02.841
It's not that I don't trust
you, it's just that...

38:02.875 --> 38:05.944
We have John and we both
have responsibilities.

38:05.978 --> 38:08.847
You're only 18
and I'm only 17,

38:08.881 --> 38:11.082
and, I don't know, we have our
whole lives in front of us.

38:11.117 --> 38:13.785
And maybe you don't want to
live in your little apartment

38:13.819 --> 38:16.020
with the idiot who got
pregnant and had a baby.

38:16.055 --> 38:17.122
Why would you say that?

38:17.156 --> 38:18.990
You know I don't
think of you that way.

38:19.024 --> 38:21.059
And I don't think of our son
as just a baby.

38:21.093 --> 38:23.094
Have I done anything
that would indicate

38:23.129 --> 38:26.131
that I might not want to live with
you and John? Anything at all?

38:26.165 --> 38:28.933
No, I haven't.
So, you know what, Amy?

38:28.968 --> 38:30.902
Maybe you're the one who doesn't
want to live with the idiot

38:30.936 --> 38:32.003
who got you pregnant.

38:32.037 --> 38:34.038
And maybe you just
don't want to say so.

38:34.073 --> 38:36.674
Maybe you really had rather be
here, in the house you grew up in,

38:36.709 --> 38:39.043
with your mommy and daddy still
taking care of you and John.

38:39.078 --> 38:41.012
Uh-uh.
Do not do that.

38:41.046 --> 38:44.015
Do not physically get in my
way when I'm angry. That...

38:44.049 --> 38:45.917
That is not
a good thing to do.

38:45.951 --> 38:47.886
I don't want you
to leave, Ricky.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.787
I don't want to live here.

38:49.822 --> 38:51.723
I want to live in our little
apartment over the butcher shop

38:51.757 --> 38:54.025
with you and our son.

38:54.059 --> 38:56.027
I just feel so
threatened by Adrian

38:56.061 --> 38:57.762
because now she's
free from Ben

38:57.796 --> 38:58.930
and she's determined
to be with you, and...

38:58.964 --> 38:59.998
And you don't trust me.

39:00.032 --> 39:02.033
Please don't leave, Ricky.

39:02.067 --> 39:03.968
Please.

39:04.003 --> 39:06.771
I don't want to be
like my parents, okay.

39:06.805 --> 39:09.807
Going back and forth all the
time, I don't want that.

39:11.043 --> 39:13.011
And this doesn't just
feel like another argument.

39:13.045 --> 39:15.813
This feels like something more.
So, please, don't leave.

39:15.848 --> 39:17.982
And if you do, take
me and John with you.

39:18.017 --> 39:19.372
I'm just going to go back
to the apartment, all right?

39:19.397 --> 39:20.797
I need to be by myself.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.921
Please.
Don't do this.

39:22.955 --> 39:24.822
Just let me have
my time alone, okay?

39:30.029 --> 39:31.996
It's not anything
more than that.

39:32.031 --> 39:33.965
I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

39:33.999 --> 39:36.834
We'll spend tomorrow night together
here or there, whatever you want.

39:38.003 --> 39:39.938
But really, I have to be
by myself right now.

39:39.972 --> 39:41.873
Okay.

39:41.907 --> 39:42.974
Okay?

39:43.008 --> 39:44.075
I said okay.

39:56.722 --> 39:57.789
Where you going?

39:57.823 --> 39:59.991
I just need
some space.

40:00.025 --> 40:01.960
I'm going back
over to the apartment.

40:01.994 --> 40:03.995
Tonight?

40:04.029 --> 40:05.945
After Adrian marched over here
and told the woman you love

40:05.970 --> 40:06.998
that she's coming after you?

40:06.999 --> 40:08.866
This has nothing
to do with Adrian.

40:08.901 --> 40:11.035
This doesn't even have anything
to do with me and Amy.

40:11.070 --> 40:12.870
It's just about me.

40:12.905 --> 40:14.005
I need to be alone.

40:14.039 --> 40:16.074
Careful what you wish for,
you may end up alone.

40:16.108 --> 40:18.710
Yeah. Like George.
Or like me.

40:18.744 --> 40:20.945
Well, before George and me
decided to live together.

40:22.781 --> 40:23.815
What?

40:36.996 --> 40:39.697
Please enter your pass code.

40:42.935 --> 40:44.702
J-O-H-N?

40:45.938 --> 40:47.939
<i>You have three</i>
<i>saved messages.</i>

40:49.008 --> 40:49.974
Lucky guess.

40:51.043 --> 40:53.678
<i>Long time, no see.</i>

40:53.712 --> 40:55.680
<i>I've been</i>
<i>thinking about you.</i>

40:55.714 --> 40:58.983
<i>And I know you've been thinking</i>
<i>about me, haven't you?</i>

41:00.052 --> 41:01.886
<i>Good night, Ricky.</i>

41:04.723 --> 41:08.760
<i>Come on, call me back. You know</i>
<i>you want to call me back.</i>

41:08.794 --> 41:10.795
<i>Aren't you bored</i>
<i>just talking to Amy?</i>

41:11.730 --> 41:12.830
What are you doing?

41:13.799 --> 41:15.967
I forgot my phone.

41:16.001 --> 41:20.004
I thought it was on the kitchen
counter, but I see it's not.

41:41.060 --> 41:42.894
I don't even know
why I try.

41:42.928 --> 41:44.929
No one in this family can
even have a relationship.

41:44.963 --> 41:46.698
Or your family.

42:11.924 --> 42:13.691
I love being married
to you.

42:13.726 --> 42:14.959
I love being
married to you, too.

42:14.993 --> 42:17.729
You don't even feel slightly
guilty about tonight?

42:17.763 --> 42:20.031
Are you kidding?
We worked for this, we earned it.

42:20.065 --> 42:21.866
But our marriage isn't
such hard work, is it?

42:21.900 --> 42:23.868
No, it isn't.

42:25.838 --> 42:27.071
I love you.
I love you.
