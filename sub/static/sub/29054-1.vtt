one of the most widely

01:57.868 --> 02:00.871
from the most successful
pop group of all time.

02:01.122 --> 02:04.250
To me, John Lennon means
imagine, freedom, and love.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.044
A visionary,
activist, pro-mankind.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.689
Well, he was
always the edgy one,

02:09.713 --> 02:11.298
gave a little bit of spice.

02:11.549 --> 02:14.051
John is the
one who started it all.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.971
But how many people
know the real John Lennon,

02:17.221 --> 02:20.224
the personality formed through
his childhood experiences

02:20.474 --> 02:22.834
and the things that happened
to him before he became famous?

02:24.270 --> 02:28.149
♪ Won't you please,
please help me ♪

02:58.762 --> 03:00.097
During the 1800s,

03:00.347 --> 03:02.308
Liverpool's importance
as a seaport

03:02.558 --> 03:05.519
had already attracted large
Welsh and Irish communities.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.524
But when Ireland's staple
food crops were destroyed

03:10.774 --> 03:13.694
by potato blights in the 1840s,

03:13.944 --> 03:16.655
thousands of starving
families fled to Liverpool.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.952
Among them was John's
great-grandfather, James Lennon.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.751
- When James Lennon arrived
in Liverpool in the 1840s,

03:29.001 --> 03:32.463
he turned up in a place which
really was a city of plague,

03:32.713 --> 03:35.007
known as the hospital
and cemetery of Ireland,

03:35.257 --> 03:38.719
as hundreds of thousands of
people escaped the horrors

03:38.969 --> 03:41.263
of poverty and
the potato famine.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.739
We refer to Liverpudlians
as scousers,

03:58.989 --> 04:00.909
and we know scouse actually
comes from Lobscouse,

04:01.075 --> 04:02.201
a Scandinavian thing,

04:02.451 --> 04:05.120
but scouse is clearly Irish
stew by any other name.

04:05.371 --> 04:08.958
And that really is the key bit
of the Liverpool melting pot.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.877
It's the Irish who gives
so much to making sure

04:12.127 --> 04:14.880
that Liverpool is sort of
in the north of England

04:15.130 --> 04:16.130
but not really of it.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.259
It's somewhere
completely different.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.890
Well, for me, Lennon
is the classic sort

04:25.140 --> 04:27.643
of hyphenated identity that
not many, many migrants

04:27.893 --> 04:29.093
within the United Kingdom get,

04:29.311 --> 04:31.730
but you do have this genuine
Liverpool-Irish thing.

04:31.981 --> 04:33.461
And I think that
Liverpool-Irish thing

04:33.691 --> 04:35.451
is at the heart of the
fact that we're living

04:35.526 --> 04:37.069
in the People's
Republic of Merseyside,

04:37.319 --> 04:40.239
and it's that sort of irreverence towards the establishment,

04:40.489 --> 04:42.449
which I think Lennon epitomizes.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.137
We were a port, the
second biggest port in England,

04:46.161 --> 04:47.955
also between Manchester
and Liverpool.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.683
That's where all the,
the north was where

04:49.707 --> 04:51.709
the money was made in the
1800s or whenever it was.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.079
That was when all the brass
and the heavy people were,

04:54.211 --> 04:56.672
and that's where the
despised people were.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.275
We were the ones that
were looked down upon

04:58.299 --> 04:59.717
by the southerners as animals,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.844
and also a great amount
of Irish descent,

05:02.094 --> 05:04.555
and blacks and Chinamen
and all sorts there.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.515
It's like San
Francisco, you know.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.434
And it was a very
poor city and tough.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.227
But people have a sense of humor

05:10.477 --> 05:12.980
because they're in so
much pain, you know?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.542
So they're always cracking
these jokes, they're very witty.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.402
And it's an Irish
place, you know?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.863
It's where the Irish came
when they ran out of potatoes.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.990
And it's where black
people were left

05:23.240 --> 05:26.201
or workers, slaves or whatever,
and created communities.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.212
It's cosmopolitan, and
it's where the sailors

05:28.329 --> 05:29.347
would come home with
the blues records

05:29.371 --> 05:31.832
from America on the ships!

05:35.127 --> 05:36.438
Liverpool's dominance

05:36.462 --> 05:38.464
as Britain's second
city of empire,

05:38.714 --> 05:39.840
created thousands of jobs

05:40.090 --> 05:41.967
in shipping and dock working.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.511
It was in this busy world
that John's parents,

05:44.762 --> 05:46.472
Alfred Lennon and Julia Stanley,

05:46.722 --> 05:48.849
met before marrying in 1938.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.018
The Stanleys were
a close knit family

05:51.268 --> 05:53.062
from Welsh and
Irish backgrounds,

05:53.312 --> 05:56.106
with free-spirited Julia
being one of five sisters.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.651
This is London.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.946
You will now hear a statement
by the prime minister.

06:03.197 --> 06:06.742
This
country is at war with Germany.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.304
The
outbreak of World War II

06:09.328 --> 06:12.915
in 1939, turned Alf
Lennon's life upside down.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.501
From his peacetime role
as a ship's steward,

06:15.751 --> 06:17.961
Alf became one of
10,000 Liverpool seamen

06:18.212 --> 06:21.006
keeping Britain's supplies
flowing across the Atlantic.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.968
Dangerous work indeed,
but danger was coming closer to home.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.971
Hitler's Luftwaffe was planning
to destroy the vital port

06:28.222 --> 06:28.931
at all costs.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.039
- Liverpool suffered
tremendously in the blitz,

06:49.159 --> 06:50.994
I think it was the second

06:51.245 --> 06:53.997
in terms of casualties
after London.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.250
Nearly 4000 people were killed.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.253
The actual damage to
houses was extensive.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.046
Huge places were blown up,

07:01.296 --> 07:03.090
so there was a real
fear of bombing.

07:04.550 --> 07:08.595
♪ Run, rabbit, run,

07:08.846 --> 07:10.156

On
October the 9th, 1940,

07:12.808 --> 07:15.519
Julia Lennon gave birth
to her first child,

07:15.769 --> 07:16.979
John Winston Lennon.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.417
The day
that Lennon was born,

07:20.441 --> 07:23.193
we do have a record of
the Luftwaffe bombings.

07:23.444 --> 07:26.321
There was no bombing raid
over Liverpool that night.

07:27.281 --> 07:27.948
I would think at the end

07:28.198 --> 07:29.408
of the Battle of Britain,

07:29.658 --> 07:31.219
you could say that
Churchill was at the height

07:31.243 --> 07:32.911
of his popularity at that point.

07:33.162 --> 07:36.290
So, there are people
who named their children

07:36.540 --> 07:40.752
after Winston Churchill, not
that many, it has to be said.

07:41.003 --> 07:45.966
♪ So run, rabbit, run,
rabbit, run, run, run ♪

07:47.718 --> 07:48.903
The early
wartime years saw

07:48.927 --> 07:51.013
John and Julia living
with her parents

07:51.263 --> 07:53.348
in a small house
in Newcastle Road.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.352
But although John's
father Alf paid the rent,

07:57.603 --> 07:58.729
he was rarely home.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.274
He was destined to be at
sea for months at a time.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.611
Here we have
another kind of myth,

08:05.861 --> 08:09.031
that John Lennon's father ran
away to the Merchant Navy,

08:09.281 --> 08:11.074
but of course he was
an indentured member

08:11.325 --> 08:12.576
of the Merchant Navy,

08:12.826 --> 08:16.455
and the Merchant Navy was a
key part of the war effort.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.957
We needed to keep those
merchant ships going,

08:19.208 --> 08:20.792
bringing those
goods from America,

08:21.043 --> 08:23.086
bringing those armaments
from America as well.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.005
So he didn't have a choice here.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.091
So really, he didn't run
away from John Lennon.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.511
He just went back to doing
what he'd always done,

08:30.761 --> 08:33.179
which was to be a member
of the Merchant Navy.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.433
During
a voyage in 1943,

08:36.683 --> 08:39.186
Alf's luck ran out when he
left his ship in New York,

08:39.436 --> 08:42.313
hoping to join another
and improve his prospects.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.817
Without the right documents,
he was left high and dry

08:46.068 --> 08:48.570
and held as an illegal
alien on Ellis Island.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.616
His pay was stopped, and
Julia feared the worst.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.201
Suddenly without money,

08:54.451 --> 08:57.162
Julia was forced to seek
part time work in two pubs,

08:57.412 --> 08:59.122
and it was here she
began a casual affair

08:59.373 --> 09:02.125
with a soldier,
Vernon Taffy Williams.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.670
Ever-changing
domestic arrangements

09:04.920 --> 09:06.040
and different father figures

09:06.213 --> 09:07.422
during John's early years

09:07.673 --> 09:10.092
were to leave their
lasting scars.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.510
His real father, Alf Lennon,

09:11.760 --> 09:14.263
came home to find Julia
pregnant by another man.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.015
Then, amid the arguments,

09:17.266 --> 09:20.477
Julia surprised everyone
by spurning both men.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.896
With his marriage over,

09:23.146 --> 09:25.023
Alf took John to stay
with his brother Sydney

09:25.274 --> 09:27.234
before returning him to
his Julia's oldest sister,

09:27.401 --> 09:30.028
Mimi Smith, and
her husband George.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.989
- I think what's interesting

09:32.239 --> 09:33.657
about Lennon's
wartime experience is

09:33.907 --> 09:36.034
that he's not evacuated.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.578
So he doesn't go to North Wales

09:37.828 --> 09:40.664
as many children
from Liverpool went.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.674
I think if we look at
Lennon's early life,

09:50.924 --> 09:53.302
we can see that it was an
era of great austerity.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.846
Rationing, of course,
had been brought in.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.223
The culture of Britain
is completely different

09:58.473 --> 10:00.809
from the culture that
comes in the 1950s.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.437
Mostly, people
listen to the radio.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.439
Joking is very important.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.609
A lot of the comedians
that Lennon would've heard

10:07.816 --> 10:10.068
in his early life,
Ted Ray, Arthur Askey,

10:10.319 --> 10:12.487
and Tommy Handley, all
come from Liverpool.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.285
The biggest musical
star is George Formby,

10:18.535 --> 10:20.078
the lad from Wigan.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.080
It would've been impossible

10:22.331 --> 10:25.125
to envisage a figure
like Elvis Presley.

Julia Lennon gave birth
to her illegitimate child.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.189
But following disapproval
from her own father,

10:47.439 --> 10:49.733
the girl was given
up for adoption.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.861
Despite Alf Lennon
refusing to divorce Julia,

10:53.111 --> 10:56.573
she embarked on a new relationship with John Bobby Dykins,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.784
a sometimes salesman and waiter.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.162
He was just as unpopular as
Alf in the Stanley family

11:02.412 --> 11:04.331
and was often
referred to as Spiv.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.591
which is in the
suburbs of Liverpool.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.928
We normally associate
suburbs with respectability,

11:18.178 --> 11:20.472
but in this street, there
were many comings and goings,

11:20.722 --> 11:23.183
which were less
than respectable.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.353
The fact that Julia
Lennon was living in sin

11:26.603 --> 11:30.565
but also in an adulterous
relationship is significant.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.776
Julia and
new partner, Bobby Dykins,

11:33.026 --> 11:34.861
took John Lennon to
live in a small flat

11:35.112 --> 11:38.615
where their living arrangements
soon fueled another crisis.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.535
News had reached Julia's
father, Pop Stanley,

11:41.785 --> 11:44.663
that John was not only
sharing a bed with Julia,

11:44.913 --> 11:46.623
but with Dykins, too.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.209
Liverpool Child Welfare
Service stepped in,

11:49.459 --> 11:51.461
and John was quickly
sent to live with Mimi

11:51.712 --> 11:54.047
and her husband
George in Woolton.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.718
- In 1933, protection of
children legislation ensured

11:57.968 --> 12:01.513
that local authorities
were able to step in.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.015
Priority was maintaining
a child's relationship

12:04.266 --> 12:05.726
with his mother.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.937
But the mother may well be considered fit to rear the child,

12:09.187 --> 12:11.857
however, the environment
the child is being reared in

12:12.107 --> 12:14.651
could be deemed unsuitable.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.737
John Lennon's effective
sleeping arrangements,

12:16.987 --> 12:18.405
would be with Bobby
and his mother.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.966
What happened was that
he was transferred

12:19.990 --> 12:22.200
from one Liverpool to another.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.493
In many ways, of course,

12:23.744 --> 12:26.538
Lennon was a migrant
within Liverpool.

12:26.788 --> 12:27.831
His early years,

12:28.081 --> 12:29.600
even though he maybe not
remember many of them,

12:29.624 --> 12:30.917
were probably very formative.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.544
And that old Liverpool,

12:32.794 --> 12:35.422
which he returned
to through music,

12:35.672 --> 12:38.258
through gangs, through the
youth culture of the time,

12:38.508 --> 12:40.427
it's almost as if John Lennon

12:40.677 --> 12:42.220
carried the old
Liverpool with him,

12:42.471 --> 12:46.016
in his DNA, or in his early
environmental experiences.

12:50.020 --> 12:54.941

13:13.502 --> 13:15.420
With John
now living at Mendips,

13:15.670 --> 13:17.297
Aunt Mimi contacted Alf Lennon

13:17.547 --> 13:19.132
for financial assistance.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.634
Alf was happy to help,

13:20.884 --> 13:23.345
and even happier to take
John on holiday to Blackpool.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.388
It seemed innocent enough,

13:25.639 --> 13:27.307
but Alf had bigger plans.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.644
- So I went to see
all the moms and dads,

13:30.894 --> 13:32.395
I did Alf Lennon
you know, as well.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.065
I tracked him down,
and he was working

13:35.315 --> 13:39.653
as a washer up in a
roadhouse in Chiswick.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.780
Alf had contact with Mimi,

13:42.030 --> 13:46.243
Mimi allowed him to
come and see John,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.286
and they went off to Blackpool

13:48.537 --> 13:50.080
to stay with some friends.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.166
And it was in Blackpool
that Alf got this idea

13:53.416 --> 13:54.918
that he would do a runner,

13:55.168 --> 13:57.003
and go off with John,
just the two of them,

13:57.254 --> 13:58.254
to New Zealand.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.631
And he told John this,

13:59.881 --> 14:01.675
and John obviously,
that'll be fun,

14:01.925 --> 14:02.968
going to New Zealand.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.512
He stays away longer
than he should've done,

14:05.762 --> 14:07.281
they all get worried
back in Liverpool,

14:07.305 --> 14:10.183
back in Woolton, and
Julia tracks them down,

14:10.433 --> 14:11.685
Julia arrives at the door,

14:11.935 --> 14:15.355
and Alf said no, he's coming
with me to New Zealand,

14:15.605 --> 14:17.232
and Julia said no,
he's coming back.

14:17.482 --> 14:21.611
So this is a tug of
war on the doorstep,

14:21.862 --> 14:23.363
and in the end John chooses,

14:23.613 --> 14:25.365
and he chooses to
go back with Julia,

14:25.615 --> 14:27.450
and then Alf disappears.

14:27.701 --> 14:32.664
♪ Father, you left me ♪

14:34.624 --> 14:37.460
♪ I never left you ♪

14:39.754 --> 14:41.314
- When I was doing
The Beatles biography

14:41.506 --> 14:42.757
during those two years,

14:44.634 --> 14:46.154
as I was doing
interviewing one to one,

14:46.261 --> 14:49.347
I would everything down
in a little red notebook.

14:49.598 --> 14:50.181
John, there we are, John once,

14:50.432 --> 14:51.892
that's the first John.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.310
And my dad looking after me,

14:53.560 --> 14:55.645
took me to Blackpool
to his uncle's house.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.440
Mother going with another bloke.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.150
Which do you want to go to?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.526
Father or mother?

15:01.776 --> 15:04.654
And the first one he
decided his father,

15:05.822 --> 15:07.908
and then he decided
to go with his mother.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.287
Then Mimi not allowed me...

15:12.537 --> 15:13.246
Oh yeah.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.081
So he chose to go with Julia,

15:15.332 --> 15:17.667
but Mimi wouldn't allow
him to go with the Dykins.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.753
Ended up with Mimi.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.464
So that's it.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.716
Once back
in Liverpool with John,

15:24.966 --> 15:26.968
Julia was embroiled
in another heated row

15:27.218 --> 15:28.386

15:38.813 --> 15:41.066

15:44.444 --> 15:47.280
She wanted to take John

and she said, Mimi wanted him,

15:49.366 --> 15:51.743
he was a very sweet
little boy, now very cute.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.453

No real

16:13.431 --> 16:14.659
because she wasn't
there, or father,

16:14.683 --> 16:16.160
but still, one of
the hardest things is

16:16.184 --> 16:19.020
to realize that actually
they didn't want you.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.898
Oh, they didn't want
me, that is a fact.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.776
I was not wanted, no
wonder I feel shitty.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.146
Cause I couldn't explain it,

16:26.277 --> 16:27.477
as a child, you just know that

16:27.570 --> 16:29.048
something's not right,
something is not there.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.951

years of upheaval

17:08.153 --> 17:10.696
with different homes,
and different people,

17:10.946 --> 17:13.157
John finally had some
stability in his life.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.952
And while he still
occasionally saw his mother,

17:16.202 --> 17:18.038
his home appeared to be settled,

17:18.288 --> 17:20.749
in leafy Woolton,
with Aunt Mimi,

17:20.999 --> 17:23.042
and Uncle George in Mendips.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.295
- So Menlove Avenue
back in the 50s,

17:25.545 --> 17:26.731
would've been tramlines
going down the middle,

17:26.755 --> 17:28.715
a little hedgy at
the side of that.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.067
Obviously there would
be some traffic,

17:30.091 --> 17:31.634
but not as much
as there is today.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.970
It's really
busy, isn't it?

17:34.220 --> 17:36.264
Well, it's a major
thoroughfare in Liverpool,

17:36.514 --> 17:37.057
Menlove Avenue.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.349
- This is Mendips.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.244
This is where John lived
from the age of five,

17:40.268 --> 17:42.020
mostly all the way
through to 1963,

17:42.270 --> 17:45.065
when The Beatles
went down to London.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.567
Most importantly for
John, was his bedroom,

17:47.817 --> 17:49.527
and his bedroom is
the small window

17:49.778 --> 17:50.820
above the front door,

17:51.071 --> 17:53.156
that's where he'd
be at his thinking,

17:53.406 --> 17:54.699
his writing, his drawing.

17:55.909 --> 17:56.618
So, what sort of
things do you think

17:56.868 --> 17:58.703
he would've been reading?

17:58.953 --> 18:00.431
- Well, I know you'd
of definitely found

18:00.455 --> 18:02.575
some of Richard Compton's
Just William books in there.

18:02.624 --> 18:06.127
I always find it's
weird imagining him

18:06.377 --> 18:06.920
reading these kind of books,

18:07.170 --> 18:08.170
I've got a couple here,

18:08.379 --> 18:11.091
William the Rebel,
maybe not so unusually.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.718
William the Outlaw.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.763
But in another way, it
just reinforces an idea

18:17.013 --> 18:17.680
that we might have of Lennon

18:17.931 --> 18:19.516
as a kind of gang leader,

18:19.766 --> 18:21.285
cause one thing you know
about the Just William books,

18:21.309 --> 18:22.589
is he has his own little clique,

18:22.811 --> 18:24.521
a bunch of people
he runs around with.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.648
And I think he had that
when he lived here,

18:26.898 --> 18:28.459
and he ended up having it
in The Beatles as well,

18:28.483 --> 18:29.483
you could argue.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.012
You know, The
Beatles were a gang.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.816
So he read stuff like this,

18:33.029 --> 18:35.031
but also, I mean, I
guess it's well known

18:35.281 --> 18:37.367
he loved the Lewis
Carroll books,

18:37.617 --> 18:40.161
Alice in Wonderland and Alice
Through the Looking Glass.

18:40.411 --> 18:41.771
So I guess that's
the kind of thing

18:41.913 --> 18:43.289
he'd be reading.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.017
Just think about him in
that room up there though,

18:45.041 --> 18:47.061
I love the idea of him
listening to Radio Luxembourg,

18:47.085 --> 18:48.765
and the thing I love
about Radio Luxembourg

18:48.795 --> 18:51.422
is it was a stronger
signal at night.

18:51.673 --> 18:52.942
It's almost like
this organic thing,

18:52.966 --> 18:54.676
or a thing that's
tuned into the planet,

18:54.926 --> 18:57.011
so when it goes dark,
the signal gets louder.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.805
So that little room is like

18:59.055 --> 19:01.808
a self facilitating
multimedia Center.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.178
He's plugged into the world,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.228
or to Europe at least,
via Radio Luxembourg,

19:05.478 --> 19:07.397
he's reading books,
he's got a typewriter

19:07.647 --> 19:10.984
so he's kind of
producing text as well.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.527
And also it's a room.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.654
It's a kind of refuge,
it's his childhood

19:14.904 --> 19:16.489
and adolescent space, I guess.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.075
- Well this is Vale
Road of course,

19:19.325 --> 19:21.870
we're standing outside my house.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.706
Just further down
the road on the left

19:24.956 --> 19:27.125
is where Ivan Vaughan lived,

19:27.375 --> 19:30.879
and he was the guy that
introduced Paul McCartney

19:31.129 --> 19:32.672
to John Lennon.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.883
Further up the road on the left

19:35.133 --> 19:37.010
is Pete Shotton's house,

19:37.260 --> 19:41.097
and behind me, at the back here,

19:41.347 --> 19:44.017
Menlove Avenue, is
where John lived.

19:45.268 --> 19:49.314
It was very much like
my own house, really.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.900
You weren't allowed to go
in through the front door,

19:52.150 --> 19:54.319
you had to go round the back.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.280
Mimi was a sort of,

19:57.530 --> 19:59.199
she was a bit of
a disciplinarian.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.827
She was, you know,
bloody keen on John

20:03.077 --> 20:04.787
doing the right thing.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.625
Uncle George was a
very affable chap,

20:08.875 --> 20:12.754
very pleasant,
quiet, good old boy.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.198
John's
life at Mendips

20:22.222 --> 20:24.140
was made easier knowing
he still had love

20:24.390 --> 20:26.809
and support from
his extended family.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.812
His Aunt Mayta, Uncle
Robert, and Cousin Stan

20:30.063 --> 20:32.315
lived in Scotland where
he visited regularly.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.360
While across the River Mersey,

20:35.610 --> 20:39.614
lived Aunt Nanny, Uncle
Sidney, and Cousin Michael.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.493
And Harry lived even
closer with Uncle Norman,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.703
and cousins Leila
and David and Wilson.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.748
And of course, John
still saw his mother,

20:48.998 --> 20:51.125
and new half-sisters,
Julia, and Jackie.

20:55.255 --> 20:58.925

lots of land ♪

20:59.175 --> 21:02.178

21:06.349 --> 21:07.629
- The world that
John grew up in,

21:07.809 --> 21:08.809
and that I grew up in,

21:08.977 --> 21:10.270
when the war finished,

21:10.520 --> 21:14.524
we were brought it in the
way of our parents lives

21:14.774 --> 21:16.943
which were in the 20s and 30s.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.780
And it was a gentle,
quiet, cozy way of life.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.532
- When the Second
World War ended,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.659
everybody thought that
rationing would end,

21:24.909 --> 21:27.787
but of course, because we
hadn't rebuilt our trade,

21:28.037 --> 21:29.831
because we were still
pretty impoverished,

21:30.081 --> 21:31.749
rationing actually went on.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.960
So, really, the
austerity of the war

21:34.210 --> 21:37.755
kinda continued until
the sort of early 1950s.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.800
- We had no
television, of course.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.050
We did have a radio.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.638
- My big early memory
is of children.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.516
The children coming out
into the streets again

21:48.766 --> 21:51.311
after the war, because
they'd been locked away,

21:51.561 --> 21:52.854
for safety reasons.

21:53.104 --> 21:56.316
And dozens of them in
the streets playing.

21:56.566 --> 21:59.902
- We used to go up to the
Saturday morning matinees,

22:00.153 --> 22:02.864
the cinema, that
was really a riot.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.074
- We had freedom.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.326
Freedom to run.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.494
- Well, there was four
of us in the gang.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.998
It would be Pete
Shotton, Ivan Vaughan,

22:12.248 --> 22:14.000
John, and myself.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.836
I always felt that
John as the leader.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.005
But this is the tip.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.965
It used to be called the tip,

22:21.215 --> 22:23.968
and it was part
of our playground.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.721
We used to play soccer
on here, and cricket,

22:28.181 --> 22:30.058
and it was also a shortcut
to Menlove Avenue.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.561
- And this was the
stretch of land

22:33.811 --> 22:35.772
they went between, Menlove
Avenue, and Vale Road.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.816
So this is where John and
his young friends would play.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.319
And it was just like
derelict waste ground.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.071
See, on this photo here,

22:44.238 --> 22:46.133
John's on his bike, obviously
having a lot of fun,

22:46.157 --> 22:47.700
and it is just open land.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.165
Quite different obviously
to what it's like now.

22:51.245 --> 22:54.582
- But this is part of the
landscape of Lennon's childhood,

22:54.832 --> 22:56.501
just as much as
Strawberry Fields was

22:56.751 --> 22:57.960
gonna be later on.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.314
This kind of, and
I guess at the time

23:00.338 --> 23:01.418
looking at this photograph,

23:01.547 --> 23:02.867
so it would've
been a very shabby,

23:03.091 --> 23:05.760
very post-war, very
derelict sort of edge-land

23:06.969 --> 23:08.169
between the suburbs, you know,

23:08.262 --> 23:09.622
this kind of little
green corridor.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.200
I mean, it's been
really tidied up now,

23:11.391 --> 23:12.934
it's a lot greener anyway.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.977
But this would've
been important to him.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.896
- Oh yeah, absolutely, I mean,

23:17.146 --> 23:18.981
one of the great things
for John in a way was,

23:19.232 --> 23:20.312
coming from Menlove Avenue,

23:20.483 --> 23:22.235
then he'd walk across
the tip this way,

23:22.485 --> 23:25.071
because right over here
is Pete Shotton's house,

23:25.321 --> 23:26.465
and that's close to
Nigel Walley's house,

23:26.489 --> 23:28.449
and Ivan Vaughan's
house as well.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.099
And this is where,
John must've been

23:30.326 --> 23:32.620
five, six years old, not
long moved into the area.

23:34.122 --> 23:36.082
And he's almost integrating
into this little gang,

23:36.332 --> 23:37.875
but Pete is
obviously the leader,

23:38.126 --> 23:40.753
and John wanted to get
that leadership from Peter.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.464
So they end up here somewhere,

23:43.714 --> 23:45.007
having a little scrap.

23:45.258 --> 23:48.052
And at Sunday school,
Pete Shotton had realized

23:48.302 --> 23:50.012
that John's middle
name was Winston.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.533
And so Pete decides to
start taunting John,

23:52.557 --> 23:53.683
and calling him "Winnie",

23:53.933 --> 23:55.643
and that used to drive him mad.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.855
So John ends up on top
of Pete on the floor,

23:59.105 --> 24:00.273
but you know, it's not fists,

24:00.523 --> 24:01.941
not punching him or anything,

24:02.191 --> 24:05.111
but it's verbals, it's don't
you ever call me that again.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.297
And again, we're looking
at the outlaws, aren't we?

24:07.321 --> 24:08.321
With that Just William.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.032
- Just William books, yeah.

24:10.283 --> 24:11.718
And that's where they
would've reinforced

24:11.742 --> 24:13.302
the sense of their
kind of outsiderness,

24:13.369 --> 24:15.830
and their gang
mentality in this space

24:16.080 --> 24:17.457
away form the adult world.

24:17.707 --> 24:20.376
I think it would've been
reinforced in a place like this.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.296
I'm also interested that
Winnie upset him so much.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.216
Names will never hurt me,

24:27.467 --> 24:30.470
but on the same effect as
sticks and stones for Lennon,

24:30.720 --> 24:32.722
and it's interesting
it became such a gobby,

24:32.972 --> 24:34.533
and in many ways, a
kind of unpleasant guy,

24:34.557 --> 24:36.559
because he could
lacerate with his mouth,

24:36.809 --> 24:38.162
he could really do a
lot of damage with it.

24:38.186 --> 24:40.855
That's my sense of
the young John Lennon.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.374
- But being out here in Woolton,

24:42.398 --> 24:43.566
which is very English,

24:43.816 --> 24:46.402
it's a very village-y feel.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.812
There wasn't a strong accent,

24:47.862 --> 24:49.542
John didn't have a
strong Liverpool accent.

24:49.614 --> 24:50.281
- No, this is the thing,

24:50.531 --> 24:51.731
Mimi wouldn't have liked that.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.493
They called it talking
broad, didn't they?

24:53.743 --> 24:56.287
But the accents, as so often
happened in those days,

24:56.537 --> 25:00.208
was tidied up and
removed from young kids

25:00.458 --> 25:01.658
a little bit like the wildness

25:01.751 --> 25:03.878
has been knocked
out of this space

25:04.128 --> 25:05.296
that we're in now.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.537
After six
months at Mosspits Lane

25:20.561 --> 25:23.773
Primary School, Mimi's
aspirations for John

25:24.023 --> 25:25.775
saw him enrolled
in another school,

25:26.776 --> 25:28.402
Dovedale Primary School.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.696
- I was very lucky to go
to Dovedale Road School.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.990
Dovedale Road County
Primaries it was called then.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.868
It was probably one of the,
if not the best school.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.238
One of the best schools in
Liverpool, South Liverpool.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.081
When you're talking
about John Lennon,

25:40.331 --> 25:41.791
although I was the year below,

25:42.041 --> 25:43.668
and I didn't mix with him,

25:43.918 --> 25:44.502
I was aware of him.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.504
You knew who he was.

25:46.754 --> 25:50.049
- It didn't take too long to
discover that he was different,

25:50.299 --> 25:51.842
and apart from anything else,

25:52.093 --> 25:54.053
he didn't live with
a mother and father,

25:55.304 --> 25:57.682
and he lived with
an auntie and uncle.

25:57.932 --> 26:00.184
That of itself is
pretty strange.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.270
- As I remember seeing
as a wee kiddie,

26:02.520 --> 26:05.022
being stuck up against the
wall for dinner tickets.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.525
Now, John didn't do these
things often himself,

26:07.775 --> 26:11.904
it was others, it was others
that did these things for him.

26:13.364 --> 26:17.034
And he just had a charisma
as well, you know,

26:17.285 --> 26:20.538
that not everybody, tons
of people wouldn't like it,

26:20.788 --> 26:24.250
but there were lots of
people that were drawn to it.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.545
- I mean, that's one class.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.298
42, I think, boys in one class.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.551
It would take quite
a lot of handling.

26:33.801 --> 26:36.137
Now mostly I remember
John not so much

26:36.387 --> 26:37.680
in the classroom in those days,

26:37.930 --> 26:39.515
but more in the playground.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.059
You know, John was tough,
but mostly verbally,

26:42.310 --> 26:43.311
not physically.

26:43.561 --> 26:44.663
He only ever would
get in a fight

26:44.687 --> 26:45.688
if he knew he could win,

26:45.938 --> 26:46.939
but he was very good,

26:47.189 --> 26:48.549
I mean he had a
choice of language,

26:48.649 --> 26:51.277
and all my best swear words
would've come from John.

26:52.570 --> 26:56.574
- And I lost my mom,
at nine and a half, 10.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.037
And my Aunt Mina in
Pittsburgh, America,

27:01.287 --> 27:02.538
felt so sorry for me,

27:02.788 --> 27:06.584
she sent me a big package
of candy, a cowboy outfit.

27:08.210 --> 27:11.172
This business of cowboys
was into our culture,

27:11.422 --> 27:13.215
we were all possessed
with cowboys.

27:13.466 --> 27:16.427
And I'd got this wonderful,
wonderful Colt.45

27:17.637 --> 27:18.971
from my Aunt Mina in America,

27:19.221 --> 27:21.307
but foolishly took it
to Dovedale Road School.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.411
And I must've been
galloping around, you know,

27:24.435 --> 27:26.437
jumping around the playground,

27:26.687 --> 27:29.190
and firing this off,
and he'd see that, John.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.942
And he sent these two guys

27:32.193 --> 27:34.153
who I knew were
part of his group,

27:34.403 --> 27:37.156
and they got hold of me,
kicked me in the balls.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.286
I didn't take the gun off
me, by God, I was ill.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.285
I was ill for days afterwards.

27:41.535 --> 27:42.536
And I know it was Lennon,

27:42.787 --> 27:45.748
because these two guys
were part of his group.

28:02.515 --> 28:06.352
- This was a photo, the
existence of which was

28:06.602 --> 28:08.062
unknown for about 50 years,

28:08.312 --> 28:11.107
and it suddenly appeared and

28:11.357 --> 28:14.235
when the teacher who had
taken the photograph,

28:14.485 --> 28:16.612
Fred Bolt, finally died,

28:16.862 --> 28:18.948
Fred used to lead
the school camp

28:19.198 --> 28:22.535
from Dovedale Road
Primary School

28:22.785 --> 28:24.578
every year to the Isle of Man.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.578
But I think for all of us,

28:26.747 --> 28:28.958
it was the first time
we'd been away from

28:29.208 --> 28:31.377
home without our parents,

28:31.627 --> 28:33.921
and you can see John
Lennon right at the front,

28:34.171 --> 28:37.007
standing next to him
is Jimmy Tarbuck.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.928
And the body language in the
photograph is interesting,

28:41.178 --> 28:45.057
just behind that's me,
Michael Hill behind,

28:45.307 --> 28:47.560
and here is Ivan Vaughan,

28:47.810 --> 28:52.231
who was to play such a significant part in Beatles history

28:52.481 --> 28:56.652
by introducing John
Lennon to Paul McCartney.

28:56.902 --> 29:00.740
John's very much pushing
with his arms out,

29:00.990 --> 29:03.367
he's sort of I'm the
leader, you keep back,

29:03.617 --> 29:06.328
and I'm just happy,
the biggest grin,

29:06.579 --> 29:08.247
and you could see me standing,

29:08.497 --> 29:10.124
I was the tallest
boy in the school

29:10.374 --> 29:11.959
when we left about a year later.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.048
- Dovedale Road was
quite a sporty school.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.843
I don't know how he came to me

29:21.093 --> 29:22.173
to begin this boxing match,

29:22.386 --> 29:23.386
and I don't know how John

29:23.554 --> 29:25.222
came to be in the
same boxing match,

29:25.473 --> 29:27.600
but he and I were
thrown together.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.311
And John and I donned
our boxing gloves,

29:30.561 --> 29:32.271
and into the ring we went,

29:32.521 --> 29:34.607
intending to knock
it out of each other.

29:34.857 --> 29:38.110
John's eyesight wasn't
particularly good,

29:38.360 --> 29:42.364
and somehow he managed a
lucky punch on my nose,

29:42.615 --> 29:44.366
and the minute your
nose gets punched,

29:44.617 --> 29:45.618
your eyes water.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.037
So there's John Lennon
with not much sight,

29:48.287 --> 29:50.498
me, couldn't see two
feet in front of me,

29:50.748 --> 29:53.250
running around this rope ring.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.501
As you got near the ring,

29:54.710 --> 29:56.188
they would push you
back into the Center.

29:56.212 --> 29:59.340
It was the longest two
minutes of my life.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.259
That memory stays
in my mind forever,

30:02.510 --> 30:03.950
it's never gone away
all these years,

30:04.094 --> 30:05.513
it still stands out.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.848
I was in the boxing
ring with John Lennon.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.820
So, I mean we're
right around the corner

30:44.844 --> 30:45.553
from Mendips, aren't we?

30:45.803 --> 30:46.929
How far away are we, what?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.179
100, 200 yards?

30:48.347 --> 30:49.507
- Exactly, this is Vale Road,

30:49.723 --> 30:51.976
Vale Road goes, and arches
right behind Mendips

30:52.226 --> 30:53.727
where John lived.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.258
And he spent a lot of time here,

30:55.312 --> 30:57.189
cause this is where his
outlaws, his friends,

30:57.439 --> 30:58.649
this is where he lives.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.819
The Ivan Vaughan, Nigel
Walley, and Pete Shotton.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.195
They all lived here,

31:03.445 --> 31:04.923
and of course, this is
where they would come to,

31:04.947 --> 31:08.742
because this was the rear
boundary of Strawberry Fields.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.412
Not the gates that
we all think of.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.789
This is where John would
come with his friends.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.166
Most importantly was the mansion

31:16.417 --> 31:18.794
that used to stand in the
grounds of Strawberry Field.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.462
Now this was up on
top of the hill,

31:20.713 --> 31:22.089
and John could actually see

31:22.339 --> 31:25.050
from the back of
Mendips this house,

31:25.301 --> 31:27.386
and it looked like a castle.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.780
So he got a vivid imagination,

31:28.804 --> 31:30.556
as we know John had.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.017
This was a fabulous
place to come,

31:33.267 --> 31:34.267
and to explore.

31:35.436 --> 31:37.276
- And he would've used
the unofficial entrance,

31:37.521 --> 31:39.321
that's why there's a
ladder here, you noticed?

31:39.356 --> 31:40.636
- I hadn't even
noticed that one.

31:40.858 --> 31:41.877
- They would've
bunked over the wall,

31:41.901 --> 31:42.943
him and his mates.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.504
- Oh, of course, cause
you've got a group

31:44.528 --> 31:47.406
of teenage lads, a big
wall, private property.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.800
You know, they're gonna
climb over, aren't they?

31:48.824 --> 31:50.451
Go and see what's
there and of course,

31:50.701 --> 31:52.411
out here, everything's real,

31:52.661 --> 31:54.455
over there, nothing is real.

31:54.705 --> 31:57.541
- I'm thinking, you know,
the 50s, the 60s, and the 70s

31:57.791 --> 32:00.753
were a golden age of den
building in this country

32:01.003 --> 32:04.214
after the war, I mean kids
had to find that space

32:04.465 --> 32:05.505
away from the adult world,

32:05.716 --> 32:08.218
whether they were just
children or adolescence,

32:08.469 --> 32:10.387
they liked to find a space

32:10.638 --> 32:13.140
that was outside of
all the ordinary rules,

32:13.390 --> 32:14.058
and I think this must've been

32:14.308 --> 32:15.601
that kind of space for them.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.245
If you think about the
Just William books as well,

32:17.269 --> 32:18.309
it's all a gang, isn't it?

32:18.395 --> 32:19.772
And a gang mentality.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.500
And this is where he
would've gone over the wall

32:22.524 --> 32:23.067
with his mates.

32:23.317 --> 32:24.526
Do you know what though?

32:24.777 --> 32:27.529
I'm also thinking of one of
his other favorite books,

32:27.780 --> 32:28.780
Alice in Wonderland.

32:28.906 --> 32:30.491
And if you look
at the title page,

32:30.741 --> 32:32.576
it's possibly the
most famous scene

32:32.826 --> 32:34.328
in the entire book.

32:34.578 --> 32:37.122
Which is where Alice
follows the white rabbit,

32:37.373 --> 32:40.334
and finds herself going
down the rabbit hole

32:40.584 --> 32:43.212
into a kind of very
inverted world.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.648
And I guess that's
the same kind of thing

32:44.672 --> 32:46.590
as what he's up to
here, the young Lennon,

32:46.840 --> 32:49.051
he's finding another space
where nothing is real.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.427
Can I just say as well,

32:50.678 --> 32:53.347
we're in the middle of
Sandstoneopolis here.

32:53.597 --> 32:54.741
This part of South Liverpool,

32:54.765 --> 32:55.909
it might come as a
surprise to people

32:55.933 --> 32:57.851
who think of Liverpool
as a kind of,

32:58.102 --> 32:59.622
or thought of Liverpool
and The Beatles

32:59.812 --> 33:01.438
when John was here
as a kind of grimy,

33:01.689 --> 33:05.317
industrial, port city.

33:05.567 --> 33:10.280
And it was that, but it's also
got its sandstone suburbs,

33:10.531 --> 33:11.841
and I think of this
part of Liverpool

33:11.865 --> 33:13.701
as a kind of giant
walled garden,

33:13.951 --> 33:16.912
it reminds me of The Secret
Garden, Frances Hodgson Burnett,

33:17.162 --> 33:20.374
the Victorian sense of this
space out of the ordinary

33:20.624 --> 33:21.875
where the children go.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.795
Listen, I can't resist,

33:25.045 --> 33:26.405
I think I'm gonna
climb the ladder.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.674
- And can we see what
John would've seen

33:29.842 --> 33:30.842
in Strawberry Field?

33:38.726 --> 33:40.446
- I'm afraid it's gone
from nothing is real,

33:40.644 --> 33:42.396
to real estate.

33:42.646 --> 33:44.523
It's all been built over.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.358
So it's all gone.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.208
I wonder what John
would've made of that.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.172
I mean it's lovely,
but it's not otherworldly.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.196
No.

34:25.438 --> 34:30.402
♪ I've found my thrill ♪

34:31.152 --> 34:35.449
♪ On Blueberry Hill ♪

34:36.199 --> 34:40.746
♪ On Blueberry Hill ♪

34:41.746 --> 34:44.500

34:44.750 --> 34:47.002
Like every other
child in primary school,

34:47.252 --> 34:50.505
John sat the all
important eleven-plus exam

34:50.755 --> 34:52.966
to determine which senior
school he would go to.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.779
There's an exam
they have in England

34:55.803 --> 34:56.987
that they hang over your head,

34:57.012 --> 34:58.263
there's a couple of them,

34:58.514 --> 34:59.908
but one of them is
called the eleven-plus...

34:59.932 --> 35:03.310
And they hang it over
you from age five,

35:03.560 --> 35:05.038
you know, if you don't
pass the eleven-plus,

35:05.062 --> 35:06.522
which you take at 11 obviously,

35:06.772 --> 35:07.932
then you're finished in life.

35:08.065 --> 35:10.192
So that was the only
exam that I ever passed,

35:10.442 --> 35:12.277
cause I was terrified.

35:12.528 --> 35:15.155
John's success
led to the next big step.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.491
A prize place at Quarry Bank,

35:17.741 --> 35:21.036
a boys only grammar school
close to Calderstones Park.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.579
He also took another big step

35:22.830 --> 35:25.207
by renewing his relationship
with his mother.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.713

35:51.275 --> 35:52.502
The Quarry
Bank school motto

35:52.526 --> 35:55.070
is Ex Hoc Metallo Virtutem.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.699
- I recall it as out of
this quarry comes manhood.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.993
- I mean, I look
back on five years

36:01.243 --> 36:04.621
at a really good state
grammar school at Quarry Bank,

36:04.872 --> 36:06.632
and that you could go
on to go to university,

36:06.874 --> 36:09.376
and become a doctor, or
dentist, or whatever.

36:09.626 --> 36:12.129
Well, the school,
and first arriving here,

36:12.379 --> 36:13.755
you're sort of in awe of it.

36:14.006 --> 36:17.885
A beautiful building, it was
a school to aspire to get to.

36:18.135 --> 36:20.721
- I mean, when we went from
Dovedale to Quarry Bank,

36:20.971 --> 36:23.640
John was respectable, I
think he was quite angelic.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.893
This was his angelic period.

36:26.143 --> 36:28.520
But at Quarry Bank, he did
quite well in his first year,

36:28.770 --> 36:29.770
even in the top half,

36:29.897 --> 36:33.150
and kind of did a
progressive decline

36:33.400 --> 36:35.360
almost accelerating decline.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.571
And by the end of five years,

36:37.821 --> 36:39.740
they were in the bottom form.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.110
Had there been a form below,

36:41.241 --> 36:42.886
they would've been in
the bottom of that one.

36:42.910 --> 36:44.179
They were
sort of assassin,

36:44.203 --> 36:45.579
whether you went
into the A stream,

36:45.829 --> 36:47.748
the B stream, or the C stream.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.374
And both John and I,

36:49.625 --> 36:52.961
and a few others went
into the B stream,

36:53.212 --> 36:55.422
and sort of held our
own for a year or two,

36:55.672 --> 36:58.675
and then we were
going down to floor C,

36:58.926 --> 37:00.093
the rot was setting in,

37:00.344 --> 37:02.721
and we were having more
fun than education.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.651
John's
mother Julia had always

37:04.806 --> 37:06.600
come to visit him at Mendips.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.060
But now John is older.

37:08.310 --> 37:11.230
He starts to go around
by himself to her house.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.940
Their relationship
becomes closer

37:13.190 --> 37:15.359
thanks to their
shared love of music.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.049
- He talked about
going to her house,

37:17.110 --> 37:18.278
wearing these funny clothes,

37:18.528 --> 37:20.864
putting knickers on her
head and doing silly things.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.114
And he told me about,

37:22.241 --> 37:23.784
as he told everybody since about

37:24.034 --> 37:26.912
teaching him to play the
guitar with banjo chords

37:27.162 --> 37:28.580
which didn't really work.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.624
And the song she sang.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.084
So he thought she was a gas.

37:39.132 --> 37:40.217
♪ Keep that up, keep up ♪

37:40.467 --> 37:42.070
Everybody
listened to The Goon Show,

37:42.094 --> 37:42.761
it was fabulous.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.131
- And the following morning,

37:44.263 --> 37:46.181
you could get the whole
script regurgitated

37:46.431 --> 37:47.641
with all the funny voices.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.601
Do you remember
their funny voices?

37:53.438 --> 37:54.666
We all
followed the Goons,

37:54.690 --> 37:55.959
he thrived on that
sort of humor,

37:55.983 --> 37:58.568
and probably took
it a stage further.

37:58.819 --> 38:01.321
- The Daily Howl,
written by John Lennon,

38:01.571 --> 38:04.199
was just his stories about life

38:04.449 --> 38:06.118
as it was happening all around.

38:06.368 --> 38:09.037
His home life, the
life at school,

38:09.288 --> 38:11.248
his imagination
running a bit wild.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.761
If you look
at his caricatures,

38:25.012 --> 38:29.975
they were absolutely
brilliant at age 14, 15, 16.

38:31.310 --> 38:34.479
And he would've been
another Gerald Scarfe.

38:34.730 --> 38:35.957
- I think the one who
could particularly

38:35.981 --> 38:38.692
recognize his talent
with the words and pen,

38:38.942 --> 38:40.861
and his cartoons, was Burnett,

38:41.111 --> 38:42.612
a sort of relatively new teacher

38:42.863 --> 38:43.864
who came to the school,

38:44.114 --> 38:45.466
possibly when we were
in the third year,

38:45.490 --> 38:47.200
or something like that.

38:47.451 --> 38:48.910
He sort of encouraged John

38:49.161 --> 38:52.664
to write more of
his humorous stuff,

38:52.914 --> 38:54.082
and draw his cartoons.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.960
But, you know, not in
the school time, John.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.712
Not in the middle of the lesson.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.523
- There was always one
teacher in each school

39:00.547 --> 39:02.799
that would usually
be an art teacher,

39:03.050 --> 39:05.050
or an English language or
literature kind of thing,

39:05.218 --> 39:06.928
if it's anything to do
with writing or art,

39:07.179 --> 39:08.179
I was okay at it.

39:08.305 --> 39:09.574
Anything to do with
science or maths,

39:09.598 --> 39:11.725
I couldn't get it in, you know?

39:11.975 --> 39:13.643
But most subjects were
science and maths,

39:13.894 --> 39:16.688
because they supposedly
don't want artists.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.166
Even at art school they tried to

39:18.190 --> 39:19.483
turn me into a teacher,

39:19.733 --> 39:21.294
they tried to discourage
you from painting,

39:21.318 --> 39:22.986
and why not be a teacher

39:23.236 --> 39:25.447
because then you
can paint on Sunday.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.866
Idling his
way through adolescence,

39:28.116 --> 39:30.827
and tragedy struck
John once again.

39:31.078 --> 39:34.831
Uncle George, the man he
grown to love as his father,

39:35.082 --> 39:37.167
died suddenly in 1955.

39:38.919 --> 39:41.546
I think with John,
there's an underlying anger

39:41.797 --> 39:43.131
at the world,

39:43.382 --> 39:45.634
it became more evident as he
went through grammar school.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.552
I think particularly
it came to a head

39:47.803 --> 39:50.013
when his uncle died
at quite a young age,

39:50.263 --> 39:51.473
John was about 14.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.242
And that really tipped
him over the edge,

39:53.266 --> 39:55.268
he just lost all interest.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.438
Yeah, he just was
doing his own thing,

39:58.688 --> 40:01.733
and I think part of
the anger was turned

40:01.983 --> 40:03.902
against the school system.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.863
You'll never make
it, that's what they told me.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.549
If you
didn't finish school?

40:08.573 --> 40:09.991
- One maths master wrote...

40:10.242 --> 40:10.992
You're on the road to failure

40:11.243 --> 40:12.953
if he carries on this way.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.099
- The real problem
with John was that

40:16.123 --> 40:18.708
he had a dislike of authority.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.044
If he was told he
had to do something,

40:21.294 --> 40:23.922
then he automatically
went into smart reverse.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.882
In our house he was
known as "That Lennon",

40:26.133 --> 40:28.176
as in keep away
from that Lennon.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.345
If anybody was gonna
take anything too far,

40:30.595 --> 40:31.595
it was John.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.241
So he was an interesting
guy to be around

40:33.265 --> 40:33.807
from that point of view.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.058
- Sure.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.727
- Behavior, I think he
was considered to be,

40:38.979 --> 40:41.398
you know, working
against serious study.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.084
- Very bad behavior,
I mean goodness,

40:43.108 --> 40:45.277
that was what, that
was chewing in glass?

40:45.527 --> 40:48.238
That wouldn't be just
one occasion at all, no.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.741
Misbehavior again, yes.

40:51.992 --> 40:54.953
Talking in class,
talking in class.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.289
Yes, he always was
talking in class.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.416
But he was
actually getting detentions

40:59.666 --> 41:01.018
while he was on detention
for mucking about.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.085
Yeah, he would.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.003
Some of
these teachers...

41:03.253 --> 41:04.293
Do you remember Fred Yule?

41:04.379 --> 41:04.921
Yeah.

41:05.172 --> 41:05.922
He was a...

41:06.173 --> 41:07.173
Big, fat fella.

41:07.299 --> 41:07.924
With one leg.

41:08.175 --> 41:09.259
That's right.

41:09.509 --> 41:11.720
He'd been a navigator
in Wellington bombers.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.180
Was he?

41:13.430 --> 41:15.324
- Well, he was telling us
about how he got shot up

41:15.348 --> 41:17.601
and lost his leg, I
think they were doing

41:17.851 --> 41:18.977
a bombing run over Algiers,

41:19.227 --> 41:20.227
or something like that.

41:20.395 --> 41:21.396
Oh, right.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.166
- So, he wasn't gonna
stand any messing about

41:23.190 --> 41:24.190
with John Lennon.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.233
- No, no.

41:25.484 --> 41:28.487
- At one time, he picked
John up by the lapels,

41:28.737 --> 41:30.155
and held him up there,

41:30.405 --> 41:32.616
because he was a
hugely strong bloke,

41:32.866 --> 41:34.701
and because all the
strength from his tin leg

41:34.951 --> 41:36.271
went into the rest
him.

41:36.328 --> 41:37.328
- Yeah.

41:37.537 --> 41:38.639
- And he just picked
John up and...

41:38.663 --> 41:40.081
Any more of that Lennon?

41:41.875 --> 41:43.394
- Once again, he's put
on his writer's hat

41:43.418 --> 41:45.212
to follow up the success
of his first book

41:45.462 --> 41:46.588
in his own right,

41:46.838 --> 41:48.198
with another epic
of inconsequence,

41:48.298 --> 41:49.674
A Spaniard in the Works,

41:49.925 --> 41:51.805
a little work full of
pieces of political wisdom

41:51.927 --> 41:53.053
such as you've just heard,

41:53.303 --> 41:54.930
and moving poems like

41:55.180 --> 41:57.724
The Wumberlog, or the Magic Dog.

41:57.974 --> 41:59.267
- Whilst all the tow was sleepy,

41:59.518 --> 42:01.186
crept a little boy from bed,

42:01.436 --> 42:02.646
to fained the wondrous peoble

42:02.896 --> 42:04.356
what lived what they were dead.

42:04.606 --> 42:05.646
He packed a little voucher

42:05.732 --> 42:07.067
for his dinner 'neath the tree,

42:07.317 --> 42:08.610
'Perhumps a tiny dwarf or two

42:08.860 --> 42:10.278
would share a bite with me?

42:11.238 --> 42:12.381
'Perchamp I'll
see the Wumberlog,

42:12.405 --> 42:13.114
the highly feathered crow,

42:13.365 --> 42:14.991
the larfing leaping Harristweed,

42:15.242 --> 42:16.701
and good old Uncle Joe.

42:16.952 --> 42:18.161
He packed he very trunkase,

42:18.411 --> 42:19.746
clean sockers for a week.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.316
His book and denzil
for his notes,

42:21.498 --> 42:23.083
then out the windy creep.

42:23.333 --> 42:24.533
He met him friendly magic dog,

42:24.668 --> 42:26.211
all black and curlew too.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.088
Wot flew him fast
in second class

42:28.338 --> 42:29.923
to do wot he must do.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.692
And what
did people think of him?

42:31.716 --> 42:34.511
I mean a lot of the other
people didn't like him

42:34.761 --> 42:38.181
because he never owned
up to doing anything,

42:38.431 --> 42:40.016
so it would be the whole class

42:40.267 --> 42:43.770
that would be given a
detention, or held back, so.

42:45.105 --> 42:48.817
So not everybody was a
fan of John Lennon's.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.987
Do you ever
see your old schoolmates?

42:51.027 --> 42:52.588
- No, actually only a
few old school friends,

42:52.612 --> 42:53.613
not teachers, no.

42:53.863 --> 42:54.573
- Yeah.

42:54.823 --> 42:55.863
- Most of them dislike me,

42:55.907 --> 42:57.492
except for one or two, yeah.

42:57.742 --> 43:01.037
So I am always glad
to remind them.

43:01.288 --> 43:02.807
Was there
ever a teacher that...

43:02.831 --> 43:04.591
- Of their own incredible

supposed to leave

43:25.312 --> 43:26.592
the school premises
at lunchtime,

43:26.730 --> 43:28.690
but we got in the
habit of leaving,

43:28.940 --> 43:30.984
and going down to my house,

43:31.234 --> 43:33.320
which was about a 10
minute bike ride away.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.739
Down in Dovedale Road,
just along the road

43:35.989 --> 43:38.158
from the primary school.

43:38.408 --> 43:40.076
John's best friend,
my best friend,

43:40.327 --> 43:43.121
so that was John
and Pete Shotton,

43:43.371 --> 43:45.206
that's with my best
friend, Don Beatty,

43:45.457 --> 43:47.208
the four of us were the...

43:47.459 --> 43:49.139
The regular routine
was that they'd come by

43:49.336 --> 43:50.336
the fish and chips,

43:50.545 --> 43:52.005
and I'd peel off and go home,

43:52.255 --> 43:54.257
and I was very domesticated.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.667
I'd warm the plates up, and
make some bread and butter.

43:56.843 --> 43:59.721
My mother was at work,
that's how we could do that.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.056
It was innocent enough,

44:01.306 --> 44:03.516
I mean, the most we'd do
is smoke one cigarette.

44:03.767 --> 44:04.976
We'd eat some fish and chips,

44:05.226 --> 44:08.146
we might have a few
hands of shoot pontoon,

44:08.396 --> 44:09.522
but we'd listen to records,

44:09.773 --> 44:11.858
and from 14 I did a paper round,

44:12.108 --> 44:13.860
and John never had any money,

44:14.110 --> 44:15.487
and never did any
work to get any.

44:15.737 --> 44:17.006
But he was always
short of money.

44:17.030 --> 44:18.630
But I was the one who
was buying records,

44:18.657 --> 44:21.368
and initially jazz following
my brother's interest,

44:21.618 --> 44:24.162
and then through things
like Hank Williams,

44:24.412 --> 44:26.373
and John got really
hooked on Hank Williams.

44:43.556 --> 44:44.974
We had the
opportunity to go on a

44:45.225 --> 44:48.144
school exchange
program to Amsterdam,

44:48.395 --> 44:50.230
and of the four
friends, as we were then

44:50.480 --> 44:51.648
pretty close at Quarry Bank,

44:51.898 --> 44:54.067
only three of us
went to Amsterdam.

44:54.317 --> 44:55.360
John Lennon didn't go,

44:55.610 --> 44:57.862
and I wish I could tell
you why he didn't go.

44:58.113 --> 45:00.448
I discovered this
record which had only

45:00.699 --> 45:01.741
just been released,

45:01.991 --> 45:03.311
and I discovered
later it was like

45:03.493 --> 45:05.328
been released about
two days before.

45:05.578 --> 45:08.289
This record wasn't
released in the UK

45:08.540 --> 45:10.166
for about another
six or nine months,

45:10.417 --> 45:12.293
and it was Long Tall
Sally, Little Richard.

45:12.544 --> 45:13.712
Just amazing.

45:13.962 --> 45:15.547
And the young guy
in the shop told us

45:15.797 --> 45:17.597
about the record, replayed
it, and I said wow.

45:17.841 --> 45:19.676
And I remember thinking
wait 'til John Lennon

45:19.926 --> 45:20.927
hears this record.

45:21.177 --> 45:23.012
I put this on, I
told John, I said...

45:23.263 --> 45:24.305
I've got a record here,

45:24.556 --> 45:26.036
that immediately got
John's attention.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.560
So they're all quiet,
I put the record on,

45:28.810 --> 45:31.438
and this was on
a good radiogram,

45:31.688 --> 45:34.315
with a very good bass,
and it was thumping out,

45:34.566 --> 45:36.276
nobody at home, so
I had it on loud.

the silence was defeaning.

45:55.962 --> 45:59.424
So we all look at John, waiting
for him to say something,

45:59.674 --> 46:01.593
and really, it's keen
to have his reaction.

46:02.844 --> 46:06.890
No reaction, just
absolutely stunned.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.220
He didn't know what to say,

46:08.391 --> 46:10.077
and it was only a matter
of weeks after that

46:10.101 --> 46:13.480
that he went out to
London, bought a guitar.

46:13.730 --> 46:14.731

46:14.981 --> 46:18.651

46:26.618 --> 46:27.720
- I don't know
what the date was,

46:27.744 --> 46:29.954
but it must've been
earlier in 1956.

46:31.247 --> 46:32.600
John Lennon, Pete
Shotton and myself

46:32.624 --> 46:35.043
had a little meeting
outside the woodwork room

46:35.293 --> 46:37.462
with the idea of forming
this skiffle group.

46:38.755 --> 46:40.256
John Lennon had the guitar

46:40.507 --> 46:42.175
that he didn't know
much about playing,

46:42.425 --> 46:43.551
Pete Shotton had nothing.

46:43.802 --> 46:46.304
So he said okay, well,
the washboard will do you.

46:46.554 --> 46:49.349
I said I'll supply the bass,

46:49.599 --> 46:52.769
because I'd been to the
jazz clubs in town and

46:54.229 --> 46:55.480
knew all about Lonnie Donegan

46:55.730 --> 46:56.730
and the skiffle group

46:56.856 --> 46:58.775
using a tea chest for a bass.

46:59.025 --> 47:01.069
And I said right, I
will get the bass.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.279
Because there was
plenty in the school.

47:03.530 --> 47:04.280
What are they gonna call us?

47:04.531 --> 47:06.199
I said the Quarrymen,

47:06.449 --> 47:08.368
cause that's here,
Quarry Bank High School.

47:08.618 --> 47:11.079
John Lennon said no, he
didn't like the idea.

47:11.329 --> 47:14.207
Pete Shotton said no, you
know John, sounds okay.

47:15.208 --> 47:16.459
So he says, ah, all right.

47:16.709 --> 47:18.294
So that was the Quarrymen.

47:18.545 --> 47:21.172
So later that afternoon
when it was all quiet,

47:21.422 --> 47:23.383
I zipped into the woodwork room,

47:23.633 --> 47:26.344
looked around, nobody,
yep, grabbed the tea chest,

47:26.594 --> 47:28.513
and away down this
little back lane.

47:28.763 --> 47:32.225
John Lennon, Pete
Shotton, Eric Griffiths,

47:32.475 --> 47:34.394
and myself, Bill Smith.

47:34.644 --> 47:38.189
And that was the
original four Quarrymen.

- I was sitting in the
back of my dad's car

47:52.662 --> 47:54.372
outside St. Helen's Market,

47:54.622 --> 47:55.641
there was a record shop there,

47:55.665 --> 47:56.958
and the door was open.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.419
And this fantastic sound
came out of this record shop,

47:59.669 --> 48:03.298
and that was Lonnie
Donegan's Rock Island Line.

48:03.548 --> 48:04.549
And it changed my life,

48:04.799 --> 48:07.176
as it did thousands of
other people's lives.

48:07.427 --> 48:09.554
I came into school on
the Monday morning,

48:09.804 --> 48:10.930
and said to Eric Griffiths,

48:11.180 --> 48:12.891
I bought a banjo yesterday Eric,

48:13.141 --> 48:14.743
oh yes he said, do you
want to be in the group?

48:14.767 --> 48:15.435
He knew I couldn't
play because I only

48:15.685 --> 48:17.270
bought it the day before.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.855
Eric showed me the chords,

48:19.105 --> 48:20.398
we only played three chords,

48:20.648 --> 48:23.067
so it wasn't exactly
rocket science.

48:48.968 --> 48:51.346
Our tea chess
bass player, Bill Smith,

48:51.596 --> 48:53.556
for some reason, never
turned up to rehearsal,

48:53.806 --> 48:55.224
so we needed
another bass player,

48:55.475 --> 48:59.979
so I asked Len, who
was one of John's mates

49:00.229 --> 49:02.482
to take over, and
about the same time,

49:02.732 --> 49:06.527
Eric Griffiths was
coming to work on school

49:06.778 --> 49:08.458
on the same bus as
Colin was going to work,

49:08.529 --> 49:10.531
and found Colin
had a set of drums,

49:10.782 --> 49:12.784
so very quickly we
acquired a drummer

49:13.034 --> 49:14.535
and another bass player.

49:14.786 --> 49:17.622
Anyone who had an
instrument could join the band.

49:17.872 --> 49:20.667
John and Eric then
went to some guitar lessons,

49:20.917 --> 49:22.502
and after lesson two,

49:22.752 --> 49:24.271
they realized they
were getting no work,

49:24.295 --> 49:26.172
cause all they wanted
was a few chords.

49:26.422 --> 49:28.841
So they went and complained
to John's mother Julia,

49:29.092 --> 49:30.510
who could play the banjo,

49:30.760 --> 49:32.738
and she said well, if you
tune the top four strings

49:32.762 --> 49:33.888
of the guitar like a banjo,

49:34.138 --> 49:35.848
the banjo chords I will
show you will work,

49:36.099 --> 49:37.433
and that's what we did.

49:37.684 --> 49:39.102
And until Paul
McCartney came along,

49:39.352 --> 49:42.063
John and Eric played
banjo chords all the time.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.707
Once we had
two or three numbers

49:43.731 --> 49:45.251
under our belt, or
maybe a couple more,

49:45.483 --> 49:47.068
I mean just, where
are we gonna play?

49:47.318 --> 49:48.878
This is Quarry
Bank school hall,

49:49.112 --> 49:51.155
and I used to come in
here every morning.

49:51.406 --> 49:53.741
The school dances were
started around '56,

49:53.992 --> 49:56.828
there was certainly a school
dance in November '56.

49:57.078 --> 49:59.288
What we used to do was
play the interval spot,

49:59.539 --> 50:01.457
because you used to
have a dance band

50:01.708 --> 50:03.876
for waltzes, quick
steps, etcetera.

50:04.127 --> 50:05.461
And then in the interval,

50:05.712 --> 50:07.592
then you'd have a skiffle
group in the interval,

50:07.714 --> 50:09.215
who would play for
about half an hour,

50:09.465 --> 50:10.675
and that was what we did.

50:13.636 --> 50:17.515

- I remember rehearsing
in Rod's house,

50:38.828 --> 50:41.998
and then mostly I think
it was Eric's house.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.541
Did a bit in Julia's house.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.334
I forgot mum's house, yeah.

50:45.585 --> 50:47.545
- Yeah, when we were
at Julia's house,

50:48.921 --> 50:51.841
she used to let us stand in
the bathroom to practice,

50:52.091 --> 50:54.093
because it was all tiles,

50:54.343 --> 50:57.388
and you get a fantastic
reverb sound, you know>

50:57.638 --> 50:58.638
- But John was a singer,

50:58.806 --> 50:59.825
so if he didn't know a song,

50:59.849 --> 51:01.142
he wasn't gonna sing it.

51:01.392 --> 51:02.911
So, there was no point
suggesting something to him

51:02.935 --> 51:03.478
that he didn't know.

51:03.728 --> 51:04.728
Or didn't like.

51:04.812 --> 51:05.812
- Or didn't like, yeah.

51:05.938 --> 51:07.774
So, I mean he didn't sort of

51:08.816 --> 51:11.069
say I'm the boss, or
anything like that.

51:11.319 --> 51:12.599
But I think we just accepted it.

51:12.820 --> 51:13.446
- We just took it for granted
that he was the singer

51:13.696 --> 51:14.739
- Well he's a singer.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.216
- But he's only just
part of the group,

51:16.240 --> 51:17.801
he wasn't even called
the leader of the group.

51:17.825 --> 51:20.661
He had his role to play, and
we all had our role to play.

51:20.912 --> 51:23.414
- Yeah, it was all very casual.

51:24.624 --> 51:25.166
♪ Well, it's one for the money ♪

51:25.416 --> 51:26.416
♪ Two for the show ♪

51:26.626 --> 51:27.626
♪ Three to get ready ♪

51:27.752 --> 51:28.753
♪ Now go, cat, go ♪

51:29.003 --> 51:32.590
♪ But don't you step on
my blue suede shoes ♪

51:32.840 --> 51:34.342
- But then of course
Elvis came along.

51:34.592 --> 51:35.952
John wanted to be
Elvis, didn't he?

51:36.135 --> 51:37.512
- As a role model, he outshone

51:37.762 --> 51:39.555
Lonnie Donegan by a
million miles, Elvis.

51:39.806 --> 51:41.974
Rock and roll was a lot
sexier than skiffle,

51:42.225 --> 51:44.560
so when rock and
roll came along,

51:44.811 --> 51:46.604
people realized that
the same three chords

51:46.854 --> 51:48.397
they'd learned to play skiffle

51:48.648 --> 51:49.774
worked for rock and roll.

51:51.859 --> 51:54.737
In 1957,
Liverpool held street parties

51:54.987 --> 51:56.197
to celebrate the anniversary

51:56.447 --> 51:57.887
of the granting of
the city's charter

51:57.990 --> 51:59.742
by King John in 1207.

52:00.618 --> 52:01.869
In Rosebery Street, Toxteth,

52:03.121 --> 52:04.747
the Quarrymen were
booked to play.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.685
Well, Toxteth was
different in those days

52:08.709 --> 52:10.962
because of the
multicultural aspect.

52:11.212 --> 52:12.713
Lots of black, lots
of white people,

52:12.964 --> 52:14.340
you had Chinese.

52:14.590 --> 52:16.568
The party was to celebrate
the granting of the charter

52:16.592 --> 52:17.802
by King John.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.372
You know, we
decorated the street,

52:19.512 --> 52:20.792
and all the kids
who are excited,

52:20.888 --> 52:21.888
the parents were excited.

52:22.932 --> 52:24.142
And especially when they knew

52:24.392 --> 52:26.435
there's a band coming, the
likes of the Quarrymen.

52:26.686 --> 52:28.122
- Charlie Roberts who
asked me to do it,

52:28.146 --> 52:31.065
because his mom was
one of the organizers.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.775
I'd known Charlie for some time,

52:33.025 --> 52:35.278
and he was a drinking buddy, so.

52:35.528 --> 52:37.321
Well we all met
up in the village,

52:37.572 --> 52:39.157
and jumped on a bus down here,

52:39.407 --> 52:40.717
and arrived about
mid-day, didn't we?

52:40.741 --> 52:42.326
I think we set up in your house,

52:42.577 --> 52:43.897
and then I was
right out the door,

52:44.078 --> 52:45.663
around the corner
to the nearest pub.

52:47.206 --> 52:49.083
Back from the pub,
and then I think

52:49.333 --> 52:50.894
it's time to get back on the
back of the wagon, wasn't it?

52:50.918 --> 52:52.062
- It was a nice day like today,

52:52.086 --> 52:53.462
there was sun shining.

52:54.714 --> 52:55.754
♪ Oh, Maggie, Maggie Mae ♪

52:55.965 --> 52:58.050
♪ They have taken her away ♪

52:58.301 --> 53:01.846
♪ And she never walked
down Lime Street anymore ♪

53:02.096 --> 53:04.140
♪ Oh that judge, he

53:04.390 --> 53:06.184
♪ For robbing a

53:06.434 --> 53:09.687
♪ You dirty no good
robbin' Maggie Mae ♪

53:09.937 --> 53:11.647
- It was all acoustic.

53:11.898 --> 53:13.566
That's why I'm the
back of the wagon,

53:13.816 --> 53:14.936
sort of quite a distant away

53:15.026 --> 53:16.194
from the rest of the lads.

53:16.444 --> 53:17.570
Lennon's voice was amplified

53:17.820 --> 53:18.946
through a small amplifier,

53:19.197 --> 53:20.883
which I think was hanging
out the bedroom window

53:20.907 --> 53:21.657
from what I could remember.

53:21.908 --> 53:23.117
John never wore glasses,

53:23.367 --> 53:25.912
and he was extremely
short-sighted,

53:26.162 --> 53:27.642
so there was probably
a certain amount

53:27.705 --> 53:28.705
of squinting going on.

53:28.915 --> 53:30.291
But it wasn't
necessarily that John

53:30.541 --> 53:31.584
was looking at the girls,

53:31.834 --> 53:33.154
I think the girls
would pretend to

53:33.294 --> 53:34.754
sort of look at John,

53:35.004 --> 53:37.256
and either way, it made
the boyfriends jealous.

53:37.506 --> 53:39.842
So, and I saw a lot of
heads going together,

53:40.092 --> 53:41.135
and a lot of mumbling.

53:41.385 --> 53:42.779
I leaned down, I said
to one of the guys,

53:42.803 --> 53:43.888
what's going on there?

53:44.138 --> 53:45.532
And he said, they're
going to get Lennon.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.850
But John wasn't hanging
around to get got.

53:48.100 --> 53:49.460
So we just all
abandoned the wagon,

53:49.560 --> 53:53.606
and the nearest safe-haven
was Charlie's house.

53:53.856 --> 53:55.566
So we all piled into
Charlie's house.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.544
- It took quite a while
for it to quiet them down,

53:57.568 --> 54:00.238
eventually Bobby
came, a policeman,

54:00.488 --> 54:01.489
put them on the bus home.

54:02.865 --> 54:03.926
Well, somebody gave me a camera.

54:03.950 --> 54:05.993
At the time, they're just snaps.

54:06.244 --> 54:07.684
And as you say, the
very first photos

54:07.912 --> 54:08.913
of John playing live.

54:09.163 --> 54:10.843
So I'm always happy to
show them to people.

54:10.998 --> 54:13.042
Technically, they're not
good photographs maybe,

54:13.292 --> 54:15.052
but they're a piece of
history just the same.

54:15.169 --> 54:19.131

54:39.235 --> 54:41.115
The end of
John's long school years

54:41.153 --> 54:43.239
came in June, 1957,

54:43.489 --> 54:44.782
with a lengthy summer break

54:45.032 --> 54:46.792
in the tree lined suburbs
of South Liverpool.

54:47.034 --> 54:48.786
And the chance for the Quarrymen

54:49.036 --> 54:50.329
to perform once more.

54:50.579 --> 54:52.707
This time, at a fete
at St. Peter's Church

54:52.957 --> 54:53.957
at Woolton Village.

54:54.083 --> 54:55.876
♪ Well I love,
love you darlin' ♪

54:56.127 --> 54:57.670
♪ Come and go with me ♪

54:57.920 --> 54:59.088
♪ Come home with me ♪

54:59.338 --> 55:01.340
If anybody invited
us to get up and play,

55:01.590 --> 55:02.883
that was fairly exciting.

55:03.134 --> 55:05.219
But you know, this was
really a big day in Woolton.

55:05.469 --> 55:07.596
St. Peter's Rose Queen,

55:07.847 --> 55:09.056
there were two things.

55:09.307 --> 55:10.766
Bonfire night, and
the Rose Queen.

55:11.017 --> 55:13.227
It was like Carnival
in Rio for us.

55:13.477 --> 55:14.145
The fact
that the church

55:14.395 --> 55:16.272
took a chance on that, really,

55:16.522 --> 55:18.983
I mean we were doing like
devil's music, weren't we?

55:19.233 --> 55:20.901
Skiffle and a bit
of rock and roll.

55:21.152 --> 55:23.070
So the fact that they
had us on the fete

55:23.321 --> 55:24.322
in the first place,

55:24.572 --> 55:27.033
I think was a huge
leap of faith.

55:27.283 --> 55:28.283
♪ We will never part ♪

55:28.451 --> 55:30.619
♪ I need you darlin' ♪

55:30.870 --> 55:32.997
♪ So come go with me ♪

55:33.247 --> 55:36.751
♪ Whoa-woa-woa-woa ♪

55:37.001 --> 55:38.919
- So, Ivan Vaughan
was one year behind.

55:39.170 --> 55:41.213
He also took the
eleven-plus and passed,

55:41.464 --> 55:42.464
and he wanted to join up

55:42.548 --> 55:43.966
with the rest of his friends,

55:44.216 --> 55:45.416
so they're all at Quarry Bank.

55:45.634 --> 55:48.012
His parents vetoed this
because they didn't want him

55:48.262 --> 55:50.931
to be in the same
school as John Lennon.

55:51.182 --> 55:54.894
So, he was put down to
the Liverpool Institute.

55:55.144 --> 55:56.771
He became friends
with another boy

55:57.021 --> 55:58.606
who was one year
younger than us,

55:58.856 --> 56:01.025
who none of us knew, and
this was Paul McCartney.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.903
So it was Ivan Vaughan
who on that fateful day

56:04.153 --> 56:06.822
at Woolton, and fate
brought his friend,

56:07.073 --> 56:08.532
his school friend,
Paul McCartney,

56:08.783 --> 56:10.159
to St. Peter's
Church in Woolton,

56:10.409 --> 56:13.371
and introduced him to
his other best friend

56:13.621 --> 56:14.914
who was John Lennon.

56:15.164 --> 56:16.266
- This is where John
Lennon met Paul McCartney

56:16.290 --> 56:17.041
for the first time.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.001
6th of July, 1957.

56:19.251 --> 56:21.045
And it was a garden fete.

56:21.295 --> 56:23.631
Now, what to you
is a garden fete?

56:23.881 --> 56:26.050
- I'm thinking crowning
of the maid queen,

56:26.300 --> 56:29.178
coconut shies, flower
displays maybe.

56:29.428 --> 56:30.428
That kind of thing.

56:30.471 --> 56:31.138
Very English.

56:31.389 --> 56:33.140
- Yeah, an English garden party.

56:33.391 --> 56:35.935
The Quarrymen themselves
were actually on the float.

56:36.185 --> 56:37.937
- I love this photograph.

56:38.187 --> 56:42.024
It's so unadorned,
so basic, so Spartan.

56:43.317 --> 56:46.195
It's the plainest float
I think I've ever seen.

56:46.445 --> 56:48.489
I love the details, Chadwick,

56:48.739 --> 56:51.867
a Hollier based in Halewood.

56:52.118 --> 56:53.619
And then you've got this kind of

56:53.869 --> 56:56.956
tiny little attempt
at adornments,

56:57.206 --> 56:59.291
which is just a couple
of strings of bunton

56:59.542 --> 57:01.168
coming down the
back, it's fantastic.

57:01.419 --> 57:02.521
- And of course,
they were at the back

57:02.545 --> 57:03.212
of the parade, at the front

57:03.462 --> 57:04.922
you've got a marching band,

57:05.172 --> 57:06.274
you've got the scouts,
and the brownies,

57:06.298 --> 57:07.299
and the youth club.

57:07.550 --> 57:09.152
And they've got the poor
Quarrymen sat there.

57:09.176 --> 57:11.262
You can actually see from John,

57:11.512 --> 57:12.512
he's actually singing.

57:12.721 --> 57:13.761
- It is so English though,

57:13.973 --> 57:15.253
and so kind of
nostalgic as well.

57:15.474 --> 57:16.514
I mean, even these chairs,

57:16.725 --> 57:18.686
these kind of
cloth-backed chairs,

57:18.936 --> 57:20.229
I remember from
school assemblies

57:20.479 --> 57:22.898
in rooms not unlike
this one actually.

57:23.149 --> 57:24.334
The other weird
thing about this,

57:24.358 --> 57:25.961
it's almost like they're
sneaking something

57:25.985 --> 57:27.903
into something very English.

57:28.154 --> 57:30.322
You know, this is rock and roll,

57:30.573 --> 57:32.533
this is at the cutting
edge of pop culture

57:32.783 --> 57:35.035
for the time, not
just Americana.

57:35.286 --> 57:36.662
It's edgy, it's unstable,

57:36.912 --> 57:38.152
people hadn't quite figured out

57:38.205 --> 57:39.290
what rock and roll is yet.

57:39.540 --> 57:40.916
- Absolutely.

57:41.167 --> 57:42.519
- And they're bringing it
on the back of a lorry,

57:42.543 --> 57:46.213
a flatbed truck to a
village fete in Woolton.

57:46.464 --> 57:49.175
It's an incredible kind
of clash, don't you think?

57:49.425 --> 57:50.092
- Yeah, and the
fact that they're

57:50.342 --> 57:51.802
bringing it to a church event.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.888
So a church in 1957.

57:54.138 --> 57:55.198
- Let's get the
chronology right,

57:55.222 --> 57:56.891
it always kinds of defeats me,

57:57.141 --> 57:58.893
the order of which
things happened.

57:59.143 --> 58:02.855
The Quarrymen play just
over the way in a field,

58:03.105 --> 58:04.105
that's their first gig,

58:04.273 --> 58:05.459
but they're doing
two gigs that day,

58:05.483 --> 58:06.923
and in the break,
in between the two,

58:07.151 --> 58:10.112
they come over here for a
"sound check" I suppose,

58:10.362 --> 58:12.948
and Paul McCartney
meets John Lennon,

58:13.199 --> 58:14.719
and he's introduced
by a mutual friend.

58:14.783 --> 58:15.493
Is that the order of events?

58:15.743 --> 58:16.410
- That's basically it, yeah.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.328
And this was the famous photo

58:17.578 --> 58:18.662
that was taking on the day.

58:18.913 --> 58:21.040
All acoustic, apart
from the microphone.

58:21.290 --> 58:23.042
So John's at the
front, he's singing,

58:23.292 --> 58:25.085
and staring right at the camera.

58:25.336 --> 58:26.696
He knows his
picture's being taken.

58:26.879 --> 58:28.399
So then before the
evening performance,

58:28.631 --> 58:30.007
they come into this hall,

58:31.091 --> 58:32.760
and you can see round there,

58:33.010 --> 58:34.970
that's where the
stage used to be,

58:35.221 --> 58:36.805
and in that corner,
there were the steps

58:37.056 --> 58:38.056
going up to the stage,

58:38.182 --> 58:39.808
just by that radiator.

58:40.059 --> 58:44.813
And then Ivan brings Paul
and John and the Quarrymen

58:46.106 --> 58:48.901
are all standing, or
sat all around here,

58:49.151 --> 58:50.319
and they're tuning up.

58:50.569 --> 58:52.404
Ivan brings Paul over,

58:52.655 --> 58:54.175
and there you've got
this great meeting

58:54.240 --> 58:55.574
of teenage lads.

58:55.824 --> 58:57.344
Ivan again, is probably
the one who says,

58:57.368 --> 59:00.329
well go on John, let Paul
show you what he can do.

59:00.579 --> 59:03.082
So Paul gets John's guitar.

59:03.332 --> 59:04.083
So the first thing he does,

59:04.333 --> 59:05.668
is he tunes all six strings.

59:05.918 --> 59:07.038
Now that's more than anybody

59:07.086 --> 59:08.170
in the Quarrymen can do.

59:08.420 --> 59:10.297
So already he's a
superior musician.

59:10.548 --> 59:12.633
But the most impressive
thing that Paul could do,

59:12.883 --> 59:14.043
was that he'd learned to play

59:14.093 --> 59:16.011
a right handed
guitar upside down.

59:16.262 --> 59:18.681
So he flips the
guitar upside down,

59:18.931 --> 59:21.058
and starts playing and
singing 20 Flight Rock,

59:21.308 --> 59:22.308
by Eddie Cochran.

59:22.518 --> 59:25.396
And in a way, when
we go back to looking

59:25.646 --> 59:26.855
at this group of friends,

59:27.106 --> 59:28.232
and that's what they were,

59:28.482 --> 59:30.202
a group of friends,
having a bit of a laugh.

59:30.359 --> 59:32.570
Suddenly from this
point, from this meeting,

59:33.612 --> 59:35.531
the group becomes more serious.

59:35.781 --> 59:37.116
And within five months of this,

59:37.366 --> 59:39.910
most of the members of
the Quarrymen are gone,

59:40.160 --> 59:41.745
and George Harrison's
in the group.

59:41.996 --> 59:43.330
So by the end of 1957,

59:43.581 --> 59:45.221
you've got John, Paul,
and George together

59:45.374 --> 59:47.585
in a group, and that is
your genesis of The Beatles.

59:47.835 --> 59:49.461
- Well, good word.

59:49.712 --> 59:51.380
I was thinking of a
kind of creation myth,

59:51.630 --> 59:52.830
because we've got to recognize

59:52.923 --> 59:55.426
this is a sight of pop
cultural pilgrimage,

59:55.676 --> 59:57.928
people beat a path to
this church hall door.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.139
And you Wold
definitely subscribe

01:00:00.389 --> 01:00:03.517
to this kind of idea of
The Beatles beginning here.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.687
I mean, there's something
wonderfully neat about,

01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:07.038
there often is with The Beatles,

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.415
but there's something
wonderfully neat

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:10.232
about an audition here being

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.192
the genesis of The Beatles,

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:14.320
and then an audition
which Lennon

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.280
hope they'd passed
on the rooftop

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:20.159
of Appleland Quarters
at the end of the 60s,

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:22.328
and that kind of
bookends their career,

01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:23.858
that's the beginning
and the end.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.181
I mean, that's why
people come here,

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.666
because they want to
be where the two met,

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.084
and where the group began.

01:00:29.335 --> 01:00:31.086
This is where
The Beatles started.

01:00:31.337 --> 01:00:36.300
- And we're standing right
on ground zero of Beatles.

01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:40.030
♪ Up on the twelfth
I'm ready to drag ♪

01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:41.364
♪ Fifteenth floor
I'm startin' to sag ♪

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:45.809
♪ Get to the top, I'm
too tired to rock ♪

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.429
With
more than a little

01:01:04.453 --> 01:01:05.579
assistance from Mimi,

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.915
John was enrolled at
Liverpool College of Arts,

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.250
in September 1957.

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:13.212
Situated in Hope Street, next
to the Liverpool Institute,

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:14.963
the college opened
up a rich source

01:01:15.214 --> 01:01:17.508
of new friends and experiences.

01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:20.344
- Yes, a lot of poets, artists,

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.139
this was, I suppose as far
as Liverpool is concerned,

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.058
a sort of bohemian area.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:28.228
- I love the place, the
building is so beautiful,

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:32.356
this lovely classical
old sandstone building.

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.650
Fabulous high ceiling
rooms to work in,

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.485
it was just fabulous,

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.654
I loved everything about it.

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:40.184
It was full of students,

01:01:40.406 --> 01:01:42.282
virtually every day,
doing something,

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:43.973
whether they were
doing dress design,

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:47.204
or lithography or pottery.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.789
Oh, this is June.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.625
She was the resident
model for the art school.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.752
But she's worked
for donkeys, yes.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:56.880
She was first at
the Slade in London,

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:59.508
and then she came up to
Liverpool in the 50s.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:02.219
- I spent 50 years here.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.555
9:30 in the morning
'til nine at night.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.348
Oh yeah, these were
the academic days

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:07.641
when you had to draw.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.101
That was the end of the 50s,

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:13.731
and when John Lennon
arrived, I was sitting there,

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:16.233
and he looked at me,
and then he went out.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:19.737
Came and put a coat
on and came back,

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:21.697
and introduced himself.

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:22.656
Said he was John Lennon

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.867
and he enrolled to do...

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.288
An art course, and
he'd be drawing me,

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:31.415
and would that be all right?

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:33.208
- It was the first
day in college,

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:34.793
and he came over
to me and said...

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:38.672
Are you the one that painted
Lonnie Donegan?

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.633
And I said yeah!

01:02:41.884 --> 01:02:43.927
And so we were friends
evermore after that.

01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:46.555
That was the stamp of
our friendship.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:53.061
These are two sketches that
I did of John, 1958-ish.

01:02:53.312 --> 01:02:55.230
A bit scruffy, I
think he was wearing

01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:57.357
checked shirts in those days,

01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.151
tight trousers, pulled in.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:02.279
Either old chords or something.

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:05.407
Tony Curtis in the
front, D.A. at the back.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:09.578
Buddy Holly glasses, he was
very spotty at the time.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:12.122
He certainly wasn't a scouser.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.665
No, he wasn't.

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:18.504
And obviously he'd had quite
an informed home education

01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:21.673
from Mimi because he
was quite eloquent

01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:25.803
in his language,
and he was bright.

01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:27.721
But he was lazy.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.307
- He was never quiet
when he came in.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.226
He'd come into the
room and start,

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.311
he'd say anything that
came into his head,

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.164
and he'd tell you
everything of what happened

01:03:36.188 --> 01:03:37.397
the night before, or,

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:39.608
he never came in as I know,

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:43.362
and sat down quietly with
his easel and his drawing,

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:46.365
and got on with things, you see.

01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:48.826
If the teacher was
there, you know,

01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:50.285
he was told to leave or get on

01:03:50.536 --> 01:03:51.954
with his drawing, you see.

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:53.455
- Yes, well, okay.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:56.750
Life class was always
starting off quite seriously,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.394
and the master would
be in the corner

01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.418
smoking his pipe,

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.129
and we just got on
with drawing June,

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.507
or painting June,
whichever it was.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:06.176
And when it got really silent,

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:08.863
all of a sudden John's
head would pop up

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.097
behind his easel.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.182
The nostrils would
start flaring,

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.434
and I knew, you
just knew something

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:15.686
was going to happen then.

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:18.772
So he'd sort of start
laughing like a hyena,

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.567
or leaping about, and
then we were just in

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:25.028
total hysteria, and it was
like this every single time.

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:26.363
One way or another.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:30.242
And the teachers,
the profs got a bit

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.828
fed up with him, and then
just ignored him really.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:34.913
Most of them ignored him.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.416
But he did disrupt
the class quite a bit.

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:40.043
Well, these drawings
came into my hands,

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:41.646
and he gave me this
book of drawings,

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.630
and a few loose sheets as well.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:45.591
And I couldn't believe it,

01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:47.968
but I've treasured
them ever since.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.262
Until I sort of had to sell them

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:51.722
to somebody in the end.

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:53.557
These are just prints,

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:56.101
so I could remember
them for myself.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.103
So, it was an exercise book

01:04:58.353 --> 01:04:59.897
when he was still
at Quarry Bank,

01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.273
and these were characters

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.484
who were either
tutors at the school,

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:05.736
or they were friends.

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:09.948
And this was the Latin
teacher in the school,

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:12.284
I think his name was Mr. Corbin,

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:13.534
or something like that.

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:16.204
Nicotine, the Irish Madman.

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:18.498
They're so funny,
they're so humorous.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.709
- Well, John Lennon
never did much art here,

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:24.880
you know, he was always
interested in the theater,

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.925
he was always interested
in going to these places

01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:31.428
like the Pavilion, and
the Empire Theater,

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:32.678
and all that.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.350
And then the next day,
actually very funny,

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.936
he'd come in and do
these impersonations

01:05:39.186 --> 01:05:40.896
of these stars he liked.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.666
- The drawings, I
mean they were miles,

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.296
and miles of them
all over the place.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:45.984
He never stopped drawing.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:48.946
He'd make up a song as
well about any subject.

01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:50.196
People walking past,

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.573
he'd make a song up about them.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:53.263
If there's something
wrong with them.

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.744
Especially when Paul and
George came in for lunch,

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:58.789
we'd creep up to Arthur
Ballard's painting room,

01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:03.919
and they would play all
sorts of ongoing music,

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.530
Buddy Holly stuff,
and Chuck Berry,

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:07.588
and all these things.

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:10.092
And singing American
stuff, really.

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:13.220
And then they'd play some
of their own little songs

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.470
and funny songs.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.680
Oh, yes.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:17.557
He used to sing
George Formby a lot.

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:20.184
Believe it or not.

01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:20.936
That was always the finale,

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:22.938
I'm Leaning On A Lamp Post.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.609
And we'd just sit
there doing our work,

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:29.611
preparation, whatever we'd do,

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.221
we never just sat
there and gobbed,

01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:32.990
but we just listened to them.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.742
And they'd sing, and
it was just wonderful.

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:39.454
- Well, he was
loud, he was noisy.

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:45.168
And he'd decide who
he wanted to talk to,

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:47.921
and who he would
leave strictly alone,

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:51.633
which is really a
Liverpoolian characteristic.

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:53.802
People loved
him or they hated him.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:57.472
And the ones that liked
him, loved him, yeah.

01:06:57.723 --> 01:07:00.684
- I'm sure that his
bombastic attitude

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.644
a lot of the time
was to cover up

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:05.605
something vulnerable in himself.

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:08.817
Because, you know, he
played the hard man.

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:15.699
♪ Half of what I
say is meaningless ♪

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:22.289
♪ But I say it just
to reach you Julia ♪

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:25.751
♪ Julia ♪

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.812
John's carefree
time as an art student

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:31.423
was cut short when fate
knocked on the door once again.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:35.052
With news that his mother
Julia had been knocked down,

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:37.095
killed by an off duty policeman

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:39.097
near John's home
on Menlove avenue.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:41.767
It was a shattering blow.

01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:45.937
- John's mother, Julia,
was a very happy person.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.232
Always laughing, joking,

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:52.110
she was really a
terrific person.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.029
I was going around
to John's house,

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:55.947
this was in the summertime,

01:07:56.948 --> 01:08:00.368
like we often did, you
know, on a daily basis.

01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:02.829
And when I reached the gate,

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:06.625
Aunt Mimi was at the gate,

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.127
with Julia at the side.

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:13.090
And Julia said oh
John's not here,

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.717
but you can have the pleasure

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:18.595
of walking me down
to the bus stop.

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.764
I said yep, that would be great.

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.767
Well, we got to the
end of Menlove Avenue,

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.185
and we said our goodbyes,

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.647
and I peeled off to the right,

01:08:28.897 --> 01:08:31.399
she crossed over the first half,

01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:36.071
and at that point
I heard a thump,

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:39.658
and I just saw Julia
flying through the air,

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.618
and I thought Jesus Christ.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:45.913
I rushed over, and she
was laying there, I mean,

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:48.792
it was obvious she was dead.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:53.255
I could see her hair
fluttering over her face

01:08:53.505 --> 01:08:58.468
in the breeze, and I
was just devastated.

♪ Julia ♪

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:08.805
- Somebody rushed over to us

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:11.189
and said John's mom's died.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.983
And he was very, very silent.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:14.984
He never spoke, he
never spoke to me.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:17.612
And he never
mentioned his mother.

01:09:17.863 --> 01:09:20.948
And I think he bottled
everything inside,

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:23.618
it was very sad, we were
all very sorry for him

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.828
when we heard the
circumstances of it.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.749
- And he was going along
all these corridors,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.835
saying his mother
had been killed,

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.796
I mean, he was in
a terrible state.

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:39.466
Terribly upset, nobody
could calm him down,

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:41.720
and I remember him
standing, looking

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.138
down that lift shaft.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.724
I came out, and I was
looking down that lift shaft,

01:09:45.974 --> 01:09:48.852
and I thought what the
hell is he gonna do?

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.395
- And I always said
to myself afterwards,

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:54.900
well, you know, if I
would've stayed with her

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.778
50 seconds more, it would
never have happened.

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:01.698
And John was upset about it.

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:03.992
He was never the same with me

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:07.037
for quite some time afterwards.

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:08.914
You know, he went into a shell.

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:10.957
It really hit him hard.

01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:14.794
- I didn't notice any
change in him at all.

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:17.005
He either hid it very well,

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.132
or I just didn't see.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.136
- But I can't remember
him going into

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:25.889
a mourning sort of mode.

01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:31.478
Just being rather quiet for
a few weeks, that's all.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:34.064
I mean he was still
pranking and jumping about,

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:36.816
and making everybody laugh.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.819

- Cynthia was a very,
very serious worker.

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:15.272
She was very talented,

01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:19.109
and she would've made also
a great graphic artist.

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:21.778
And then one day,

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.028
she said to me, do you know
who I'm going out with?

01:11:24.072 --> 01:11:25.448
But don't tell anybody.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.493
I said who, she said
John, John Lennon.

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:31.538
I said Cyn, what
do you see in him?

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.668
She said oh, I see a lot in him.

01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:39.003
And that was it.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:41.006
And I said well, I
think he's fabulous,

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.591
but I wouldn't of
thought he's your type.

01:11:43.842 --> 01:11:45.202
It's
his vulnerability,

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:49.723
it's his chic, it's the
fact that he bared his soul.

01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:54.269
Foolishly, stupidly,
but he bared his soul

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.521
for everybody else to see.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:59.941
Cynthia Powell
later became John's first wife,

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:01.901
but they had a
troubled relationship.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.006
- John was controlling,
he's a controlling person

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:06.239
if you got half the chance,

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.908
and was a bully if he
got half the chance.

01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:13.038
And, you know, he
beat up Cynthia,

01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:16.499
and there's other girls he
was physically cruel to.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.669
So John in their
marriage was doing that,

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:22.964
and was not very kind
or nice to Cynthia.

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.884
♪ I used to be cruel to
my woman I beat her ♪

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:28.428

What's that one, about
I was cruel to my woman.

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:32.891
John wrote those lines in about

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:34.141
I'm cruel to my woman,

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:35.727
and he's cruel to lots of women.

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.646
Later,
in The Beatles years,

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:40.273
John's attitude toward women

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.192
would surface again
at Paul McCartney's

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:44.110
21st birthday party.

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:46.946

Just up over the way from me,

01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:52.035
it was Billie J. Cramer,

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:54.871
and this girl called Rose.

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:57.957
So Lennon walks down
and he sees her,

01:12:58.208 --> 01:12:58.958
and he's shouting at her,

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:00.377
and she goes blah, blah,

01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:03.546
and he goes like nah,
straight on the girl's bosoms.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:05.340
So she just gives
him a backhander,

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:06.925
I saw it, a backhander.

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:08.551
She had every right to.

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:10.887
She smacked him, get
off me, you know.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.137
And he goes like that,

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:14.599
and he gives her
a full right hand.

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:15.849
Bang.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.853
And then she fell on the floor.

01:13:19.104 --> 01:13:20.897
People had led him off.

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:31.491
As well
as Cynthia Powell,

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.993
another art student became
a significant figure

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:35.578
in John Lennon's life.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:37.747
Stuart Sutcliffe.

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.003
- While Stuart
wasn't in my group,

01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:46.423
he was a year above
with Rod Murray.

01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:49.050
And he was always in
the painting department,

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.261
because he was a
very good painter.

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.388
And he was a very quiet fellow,

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.974
a lovely person, very,
very good painter

01:13:56.224 --> 01:13:58.017
and took his work
very seriously.

01:13:58.268 --> 01:14:00.348
And all the masters thought
he was going to be great.

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:01.918
I think some of them
were a bit upset

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.815
when he became a musician.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.526
- Stuart and John
got on very well.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:07.944
A lot of it because of,

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:09.821
not just their
interest in fine art,

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:13.783
but in music, they had the
same sort of taste in music.

01:14:15.285 --> 01:14:16.345
You know,
I think John admired

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:17.369
the talent of Stuart,

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.292
and he liked people that had

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:25.086
a calming influence over
him, I think at times.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.338
Like Cynthia, and Stuart maybe,

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.550
and various other friends.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.802
- I mean, John Lennon
was told to leave here

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:36.306
because he didn't
do the art history.

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.316
I mean, usually
people that weren't

01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:41.895
that interested left,
or were told to move on

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:44.647
after the first year
and a half or so.

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:48.193
And I think John
was told to move on,

01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:51.154
because he just
didn't do anything.

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:53.740
At college,
it was fast becoming clear

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.034
that John's real
passion was for music.

01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:58.161
While John still
had no clear vision

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.163
of how to make music pay,

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.165
he was desperate enough
to do laboring work

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:04.792
to buy his first
electric guitar.

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:07.170
Clubs like the Casbah
Coffee Club in West Derby

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.130
were opening all over the city.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.675
- I was here on the
night it opened.

01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:16.054
As we came in, the
band that would play

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:18.014
were called the Quarrymen.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.141
They'd moved on from
the skiffle music,

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:21.577
these guys were playing
electric guitars.

01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:25.021
Of the original members
of the Quarrymen,

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.190
there was only John
Lennon who was here.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.902
Paul McCartney joined,
Paul had brought in George.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:33.196
I mean George could play
both of them off the stage.

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:35.448
He was tolerated as a youngster

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.283
simply because he was so good.

just for Stuart and myself,

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.384

01:15:54.634 --> 01:15:56.219
would he like to
share the bedroom?

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:59.639
In the kitchen, we had a
shelf each for our food.

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:03.434

I can't remember then
whether they were called

Beatles, or something else.

John insisted on Stuart
being bass guitarist.

01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:57.989
- They didn't have a drummer,

01:16:58.239 --> 01:16:59.425

01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:05.747
They weren't a band until
Pete Best joined up.

01:17:06.998 --> 01:17:09.125
- And then they were
offered this job,

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:14.088
Hamburg, on condition that
they had a permanent drummer.

01:17:14.339 --> 01:17:16.174
Peter got the job,
and a few days later,

01:17:16.424 --> 01:17:18.092
he was on the boat.

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.640
In August 1960,

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:26.309
John and his fellow
Beatles squeezed into a van

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.561
alongside their
manager, Allan Williams,

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.105
and his business
partner, Lord Woodbine,

01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:34.400
for a date with
destiny in Hamburg.

Pitching
up three days later

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.051
at the seedy club in
Hamburg's notorious

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.720
Red Light area, the five Beatles

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.347
hit the ground running,

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:07.725
with a unique sound that
soon pulled in the punters.

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:10.353
Including a group of
German art students.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:16.484
- When I came in
there, in that place,

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:18.027
I walked down the stairs,

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:21.322
it was full of those leather
jacketed clad rockers,

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.032
with those Elvis...

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.867
And then those rock
and roll music,

01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:28.746
The Beatles on stage are
the first guy I noticed

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.624
who was really the quintessential rocker at the time,

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:33.543
because they also
played at the theater

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:36.421
in black leather jackets.

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:38.431
The Beatles looked
exactly like the audience,

01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:40.106
you know, with the
Elvis do and all that,

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:41.676
and it was John Lennon.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.970
I mean really, like, Jesus,

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.931
he looked like Marlon Brando
in the wide run at the time.

01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:48.307
♪ Well I'm a real wild one ♪

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:49.642

♪ Wild, wild child ♪

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:58.693
- We went every
day, every evening,

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:02.196
because everything else
was boring in Hamburg.

01:19:02.447 --> 01:19:04.365
I never went to a
Jets concert again,

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.135
I only went to this
rock and roll club,

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:09.620
and right away the
very first night

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:12.999
we met The Beatles because
we looked so different.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:14.435
I know that Stuart was the first

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:15.459
who came to our table,

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:17.378
and letter John and Paul came.

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:20.173
Now Paul was obviously
very nice, and kind.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:23.301
I wasn't at all uncomfortable
in Paul's presence,

01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:24.844
because he was a charmer,

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.654
and he was, all the
time I had knew him,

01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:28.097
he was like that.

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:32.310
But of John, I felt
very uncomfortable.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.105
Because he made
sarcastic remarks.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.357
At first he said something
about my clothes,

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:40.276
but it was clothing
he had never seen

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.862
the green jacket or whatever,

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.238
or sweaters I had.

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:48.159
And I said well I
bought everything I wear

01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:52.163
in Paris, you know?

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:54.332
And then I said to soften it,

01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:56.459
well, it's on the flea market.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:59.462
And I remember then he
made immediately fun

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:03.966
as if he put a flea
from my jacket to Paul,

01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:05.676
and Paul made this.

01:20:05.927 --> 01:20:07.637
They had those
kind of reactions.

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:09.406
I didn't know the Marx
Brothers at the time,

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:12.016
I had never seen the
Marx Brothers then,

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:15.436
they had this kind of make
fun of everything, you know?

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:23.861
I've been on
pills since I was 17.

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:26.322
Since I became a musician.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:27.932
The only way to
survive in Hamburg,

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:29.277
to play eight hours a night,

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.303
was to take pills, like
the waiters gave you it.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:32.453
Pills and a drink.

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:35.665
I was a fuckin' drop
down drunk in art school,

01:20:35.915 --> 01:20:37.583
I was a pill addict,

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:41.429
just before help where
we turned out to park,

01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:43.339
and we'd drop drink,
simple as that.

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.675
I've always needed
a drug to survive.

01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:47.677
- When he got stoned,

01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:50.680
he used to foam at the mouth.

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:52.050
And he was sitting on stage,

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.225
and he'd sit on his amp,

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.520
you know, and he'd just
have it full blasted on.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.647
Going doing, doing, doing,

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:02.233
hitting the strings, you know.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:05.695
And Horst Fascher was
a odd lad in Germany,

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:06.487
he called, he said...

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:07.947
Hey John, do me a favor.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.699
Can you turn that up?

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:10.533
And John goes...

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:13.077
He said you touch that again,

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:15.447
he said and I'll cut you to
bleed in tin, you bastard.

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:16.831
He said get off the stage.

01:21:18.124 --> 01:21:20.918
- And I remember the
day there was John,

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:22.920
Paul, and George, and I,

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:24.589
we four were sitting there.

01:21:24.839 --> 01:21:27.466
And he was specifically
talking about my haircut.

01:21:27.717 --> 01:21:29.719
But then he did it like this,

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:33.931
oh no like this, in
front of Paul's hair,

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:36.559
and then he had a comb,

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:40.438
and put it like that
in front of Paul.

01:21:40.688 --> 01:21:43.441
And Paul immediately
played the act,

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:46.444
like Marx Brothers, and did
the Nazi salute, you know?

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:48.154
Immediately like
Hitler, you know?

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:52.199
And so that was typically
John, you know?

01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:53.993
- They were actually
a very poor band

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.162
compared to the rest of them.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.581
But when they went to Hamburg,

01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:01.334
six hours a night,
six days a week,

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:03.419
they honed their act together,

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:04.670
and they came back...

01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:06.231
That's what
made us all, you know.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:07.632
- Absolutely fantastic.

01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:09.467
- If you can already see,

01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:12.553
most of my photos
are all showing John.

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:15.890
And that means that I was
most fascinated by him

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.140
as a photographer.

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.476
You know, you see how he looks,

01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:20.126
he's like the cool
rocker, you know?

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:21.270
20th century.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.748
- When he held his
guitar up here,

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:23.898
almost like a Ted.

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:26.817
He was like a teddy
boy on the stage.

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:28.977
And he always fancied himself,

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:31.072
and he couldn't knock
a hole in a wet echo.

01:22:31.322 --> 01:22:31.989
- Say that again.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.866
- But he also fancied himself.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.494
A bit of a hard case, you know.

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.747
- John Lennon was
more aggressive

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:43.542
than any of the other
Beatles in any way,

01:22:43.793 --> 01:22:48.005
without being in your face
or threatening in any way.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:50.591
It was just the way
that he dealt with,

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:52.843
and his authority.

01:22:53.094 --> 01:22:54.720
- Like sometimes,
you couldn't avoid

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.430
the fact that he was there.

01:22:56.681 --> 01:22:57.932
And then other times,

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.726
he'd go into his quiet moods.

01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:03.938
- They decided when they
were 16, 17, 18 I think,

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:06.691
that they were gonna be
professional musicians.

01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:08.859
And when they came
back from Germany,

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:11.487
I think they were
further along that road.

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:16.117
They'd experienced a lot
of success in Germany.

01:23:16.367 --> 01:23:18.202
They'd come together
both musically,

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:19.996
I would think as
a group of people,

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:22.373
they were tighter
together as well.

01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:26.627

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.004

01:23:28.254 --> 01:23:29.606
Now within
touching distance

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.257
of fame and fortune,

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.510
The Beatles and their new
manager, Brian Epstein,

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.554
met up at Hamburg Airport.

01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:39.181
But something was
terribly wrong.

01:23:39.432 --> 01:23:41.600
Stuart Sutcliffe was missing.

01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:43.477
Astrid broke the news.

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:46.981
Stuart, barely 21 years old,

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:49.608
had died from a
brain haemorrhage.

01:23:49.859 --> 01:23:54.238
The specter of death had returned to haunt John once again.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:56.282
- John just freaked out.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:57.616
He completely freaked out,

01:23:57.867 --> 01:24:00.119
he freaked out as far as

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.955
just laughing until tears came.

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:09.086

01:24:10.004 --> 01:24:12.923

01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:14.800
- The fact that all of us,

01:24:15.051 --> 01:24:16.594
I liked Stuart as well.

01:24:16.844 --> 01:24:17.844
It was horrible.

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.890
It was really bad, you know.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.850
He was the James
Dean of the band.

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:24.934
You talk about looks,

01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:26.419
he was the best
looking of the band.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.813
But he was with them.

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:30.066
He wasn't with them long,

01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:32.985
but what he did
do was important.

01:24:36.781 --> 01:24:37.841
With Brian Epstein,

01:24:37.865 --> 01:24:39.825
came another rapid change.

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:41.786
Out went Pete Best,
and The Beatles

01:24:42.036 --> 01:24:44.205
wild, leather clad image,

01:24:44.455 --> 01:24:48.084
and then came Ringo, and
clean cut boys in suits.

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:52.505
Lennon's days as a rock
and roll punk were oven.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:57.718
- You know, I moved to
Paris in September '61.

01:24:58.594 --> 01:25:00.638
John and Paul came to visit me

01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:03.432
just after I had
been there one month.

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.267
Among other things,
they wanted to have

01:25:05.518 --> 01:25:06.518
the same kind of clothes,

01:25:06.644 --> 01:25:07.764
take me to your flea market,

01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:10.439
it was one of their
biggest desires.

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:14.485
They asked me to cut their
hair like I had mine.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:15.778
So The Beatles, typically,

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:18.489
what was then known as
a mop top, you know?

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:22.993
- Personally speaking, the
leather jacket era, '61,

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:28.415
that was when
Liverpool and the fans

01:25:28.666 --> 01:25:31.669
saw The Beatles as
nobody else in the world

01:25:31.919 --> 01:25:32.919
ever saw them.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:35.548
They were pure rock and roll.

01:25:36.841 --> 01:25:39.009
And the leather jackets
made them look even better.

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:41.971
And it was when
Epstein changed them,

01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:44.181
and he groomed it out of them,

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:47.059
I just think they lost
a bit of earthiness,

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:48.869
a little bit of the
rock and roll stuff,

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:50.521
I've always felt that.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:52.982
But the point is, you
can't argue with the fact,

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:54.232
it worked.

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:56.819
We were four guys that,

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:58.964
I met Paul, and said do
you want to join my band?

01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:02.116
You know, and then
George joined,

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:03.927
and then Ringo joined,
we were just a band

01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:06.662
who made it very,
very big, that's all.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:09.248
Our best work was never
recorded, you know.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.834
In Liverpool, Hamburg,
and around the dance halls, you know?

01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:15.129
And what we generated
was fantastic,

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.298
where we played straight rock,

01:26:17.548 --> 01:26:19.884
and there was nobody
to touch us in Britain.

01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:22.428
But as soon as we
made it, we made it.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:25.055
The edges were knocked off.

01:26:25.306 --> 01:26:26.724
Brian put us in
suits and all that,

01:26:26.974 --> 01:26:28.174
and we made it very, very big,

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:29.518
but we sold out.

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:31.478
And the music was
dead before we even

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:33.439
went on the theater
tour of Britain.

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:37.026
We were feeling shit already.

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:39.588
The Beatles made it

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:40.946
as Lennon promised they would.

01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:44.033
Their music changed the world,

01:26:44.283 --> 01:26:47.411
changed our society, and
entertained millions.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:50.539
But even at the
height of their fame,

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:53.292
John's troubled childhood
was never far behind.

01:26:54.293 --> 01:26:56.128
He became a father in 1963,

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.755
when his first wife, Cynthia,

01:26:58.005 --> 01:27:00.216
gave birth a son, Julian.

01:27:00.466 --> 01:27:02.843
But in a repeat of
his own upbringing,

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:04.762
John was an absent father.

01:27:06.055 --> 01:27:07.240
He also struggled
with the pressures

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:08.682
of being a Beatle,

01:27:08.933 --> 01:27:10.976
and what became one of
his most famous songs,

01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:13.103
was originally
written as a ballad,

01:27:13.354 --> 01:27:14.897
a cry from the heart.

- I would say he was
a very witty guy,

01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:30.931
very friendly,
comical, artistic.

01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:32.933
- If you didn't know him at all,

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:34.893
he looked like
somebody you probably

01:28:35.144 --> 01:28:36.478
wouldn't want to know.

01:28:36.729 --> 01:28:39.982
An aura of don't
come too close to me,

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:42.901
or I'll butt ya, or
something like that.

01:28:43.152 --> 01:28:45.112
If he was a friend,

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:49.867
I think you could rely
on him wholeheartedly.

01:28:50.117 --> 01:28:51.660
- But I look back on five years,

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:55.164
and it was just one laugh,
after laugh, after laugh.

01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:57.309
It was great, we thoroughly
enjoyed our schooling,

01:28:57.333 --> 01:28:59.126
we laughed our way through.

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:01.170
And this was mostly John Lennon,

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:02.420
who was at the bottom.

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:04.631
It was always good fun.

01:29:04.882 --> 01:29:07.301
- Yeah, I mean, a
bit of a naughty boy.

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:09.345
But a lot of talent.

01:29:09.595 --> 01:29:10.955
- Actually, one of
the reasons John

01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:13.223
did so much charity
back later on,

01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:15.035
is to make up for being
such a little bastard

01:29:15.059 --> 01:29:16.059
when he was younger.

01:29:17.478 --> 01:29:20.064
- I think he was
determined to succeed,

01:29:20.314 --> 01:29:21.940
and I think he'd chosen,

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:24.818
inside, he'd chosen the route

01:29:25.778 --> 01:29:26.818
that he was gonna succeed,

01:29:26.904 --> 01:29:29.948
he was gonna be a star.

01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:32.951
- He was the leader
of the best pop group

01:29:33.202 --> 01:29:34.578
that Planet Earth has ever had,

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:36.747
and we'll be singing
Beatles songs

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:39.208
for as long as we've got
the breath in our body

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:40.876
to hum the tunes.

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:43.754
- The world knew there was
some greatness about him,

01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:45.484
and he'd make it in
the world somehow,

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:48.300
because he was just so
unusual as a character.

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.302
He couldn't just go unnoticed,

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:51.970
he had a presence.

For John Lennon,

life before fame was never easy.

01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:06.735
Somehow, he lived through
most of World War II,

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:09.905
austerity, and
family difficulties.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:11.990
He experience death
at first hand,

01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:14.910
with the loss of his
father figure Uncle George,

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.788
and his great friend,
Stuart Sutcliffe.

01:30:18.038 --> 01:30:21.500
But most of all, with the
loss of his mother, Julia.

01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:26.713
It was his childhood
and adolescence

01:30:26.964 --> 01:30:29.174
that shaped the man
the world came to know.
