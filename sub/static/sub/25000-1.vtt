A FILM BY ZAIDA BERGROTH

01:16.786 --> 01:19.497
Good evening, Hartola!

01:21.248 --> 01:23.709
I'm Angela.

01:24.126 --> 01:28.672
We are the Amazing Angels.

02:11.590 --> 02:15.594
It's unbelievable she'd try
to bullshit us like that.

02:15.678 --> 02:19.557
As if gas would cost that much.

02:43.455 --> 02:47.376
I had a deal with him. It's my money!
Shut the fuck up!

02:47.543 --> 02:49.628
Let me talk to him!
- Hey!

02:49.712 --> 02:51.922
Shut up.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.551
Give it back to me!

02:57.303 --> 03:00.973
Now you better run, girl...

03:15.821 --> 03:17.573
Come on!

03:41.347 --> 03:46.810
Thanks for intervening.
It was brave of you.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.399
Hi, I'm Angela.
- Anna.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.737
Where do you live?

03:56.820 --> 03:59.865
Straight ahead.
It's a 20-kilometer drive.

03:59.949 --> 04:03.535
You don't have to take me...
- Of course I will!

04:04.036 --> 04:07.456
I'm in no hurry anymore.

04:07.539 --> 04:12.169
I had a room in the hotel, but Jakke,
that guy, might come looking for me.

04:12.795 --> 04:17.173
Are there any hotels nearby?
- I don't think so.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.969
Everything's closed for the winter.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.933
Wow, your bone structure
is beautiful.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.727
This light brings it out.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.668
That show was so basic.

04:52.751 --> 04:56.880
You should see us with real lights
and costumes and all.

04:57.256 --> 05:02.428
Do I talk too much?
- No. Not at all.

05:06.640 --> 05:11.020
If you can't find a hotel,
you can sleep at our house.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.397
My house, I mean.

05:13.564 --> 05:19.028
I live by myself. My clad died recently.
- Oh no.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.781
There's plenty of room.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.251
You're some kind of an angel.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.932
Nice house.

05:52.269 --> 05:57.358
Would you like tea or something?
- No thanks. I'm beat.

06:01.070 --> 06:03.655
You want to say
a night prayer with me?

06:03.739 --> 06:06.450
Excuse me?
- I always say a night prayer.

06:06.617 --> 06:10.996
I don't usually do that.
- I'll say it for you.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.248
Dear Heavenly Father.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.667
Thank You for today.

06:16.085 --> 06:19.546
Thank You for everything
You have given us.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.675
Thank You for bringing us
to a safe haven once again.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.552
Amen.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.145
Now I feel sleepy.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.648
Praying relaxes the mind.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.360
Good night.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.533
Good night.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.285
Good morning.
- Good morning.

07:31.410 --> 07:35.164
Oh, coffee. Lovely. I so need it.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.666
Could you go into the living room?

07:38.208 --> 07:41.044
There's something for you
on the table.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.632
This book?
- Yeah.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.162
Dear Dad, How are you?
I'm good.

08:15.537 --> 08:20.042
Bye! See you soon!
Angela

09:34.992 --> 09:37.077
Okay.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.334
I think I need a cigarette.

11:44.663 --> 11:49.167
I don't know about that.
Why don't you let Tiina do that.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.552
I think it looks really nice.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.146
Do you remember anything about Dad?

12:11.273 --> 12:14.609
I mean, I was really young
when they divorced.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.405
I saw him a couple of times
after that.

12:18.780 --> 12:23.702
I guess my mom and your mom
didn't really get along.

12:29.374 --> 12:33.253
I must've written you
a thousand letters as a kid -

12:34.087 --> 12:37.174
after Dad told me
I have a big sister.

12:37.299 --> 12:42.429
- But he said your mom wouldn't give
you the letters anyway. - Oh no.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.141
But I thought about you
a lot back then.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.027
It's pretty funny
how you found me now.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.740
I have to get going.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.703
I have a couple of gigs in Tampere
over the weekend.

13:07.579 --> 13:11.082
But I don't know
how I'm going to make it.

13:12.209 --> 13:15.086
I had an argument with the girls.

13:15.337 --> 13:19.132
Driving alone is so exhausting.

13:21.676 --> 13:25.013
You have a driver's license?

13:25.722 --> 13:29.810
You'd want me to come with you?
- Why not.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.773
It's so weird touring alone.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.864
And I have to do these gigs
because I owe some money.

13:43.657 --> 13:47.077
I have work. I can't come.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.206
Okay.

13:53.124 --> 13:59.089
Well. It was really nice to see you.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.014
Bye then, sis.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.696
Wait!

14:30.495 --> 14:34.541
I wonder why Dad didn't
contact you after Mom died.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.711
Stop. No use dwelling on the past.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.422
Everything turned out really well.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.093
I don't smoke.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.763
That's smart.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.434
I also quit!

15:08.158 --> 15:14.205
<i>This will be a general report
about wind power subsidies...</i>

15:15.832 --> 15:20.337
She's so cool.
Look how well that coat fits her.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.299
The way she holds her shoulders.

15:27.218 --> 15:30.639
Hey, you could listen to this song.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.976
I'd like to use it in the show.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.274
And we'd dance to it together.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.904
I don't know how to dance.
- Of course you do.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.907
I'll show you.
It's not difficult at all.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.201
No. Seriously.

15:55.205 --> 15:59.084
I called the venue.
They weren't too happy -

15:59.167 --> 16:03.713
when I told them
I wasn't bringing a group.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.633
We'll do
really simple choreography.

16:06.716 --> 16:10.679
A beginning and an end,
and we'll improvise in between.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.731
One, two, three...

16:22.065 --> 16:25.318
Then stop and pose.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.571
One, two, three...

17:06.483 --> 17:09.029
Breathe out.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.450
Okay.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.955
If someone in the audience shouts
at you, just smile at them.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.713
Did you invite me along
just because of this?

17:26.796 --> 17:29.549
Because you needed someone?

17:30.967 --> 17:33.428
Let's just get this over with.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.658
I can't do this.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.454
Well, then we won't get any money.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.959
But I can't force you.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.728
Okay, I'll try.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.487
Hey.

18:33.279 --> 18:37.033
Imagine this is a club
in a Miami casino.

18:38.618 --> 18:45.208
There are large windows at the back
and you can see this beautiful bay -

18:45.291 --> 18:49.671
and lights and yachts.

18:50.421 --> 18:55.176
The place is packed
with fine people.

18:56.386 --> 19:02.684
Everyone is beautiful,
well dressed, rich and happy.

19:05.019 --> 19:11.442
And they're all drinking champagne.
Bottles are opened.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.529
Hear them pop.

19:15.113 --> 19:19.284
Pop. POP-

19:21.911 --> 19:25.874
Suddenly everyone becomes quiet.
It's dark.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.921
You can barely make out
two figures onstage.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.466
And we start dancing.

19:37.844 --> 19:42.849
They all applaud.
But we don't even care.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.228
We don't care about anyone else.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.524
Just look at me.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.944
Just keep looking at me
the whole time.

20:31.439 --> 20:34.108
Show us your tits!

20:36.277 --> 20:38.363
Nice ass!

21:55.815 --> 22:00.486
Thanks! The audience was great.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.488
Good evening.

22:10.371 --> 22:14.042
Take us
to the most expensive bar in town.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.961
Anna. You were great!

22:30.600 --> 22:34.604
They shouldn't let whores in...

22:36.022 --> 22:38.608
You're an impolite
and repulsive person.

22:38.691 --> 22:44.113
If I wasn't here with my sister, I'd
smash your teeth against the counter.

22:45.573 --> 22:48.826
Anna, let's go. Go, go.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.685
How boring are these people!

23:56.477 --> 23:59.355
Let me grab a couple of bottles,
and we'll go.

24:13.703 --> 24:16.330
Our hands look alike.

24:20.334 --> 24:24.046
Your ring finger is also longer
than your index finger.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.552
It means you're ruled
by your emotions.

24:31.012 --> 24:34.348
It's true with me at least.

24:38.936 --> 24:43.232
I thought I might've been
a big disappointment to you -

24:46.027 --> 24:49.322
because you left like that
in the morning.

24:49.947 --> 24:54.368
I thought you might be embarrassed
having someone like me for a sister.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.541
No.

25:03.711 --> 25:06.714
You're the one Dad chose back then.

25:15.556 --> 25:18.976
I'm happy you found me.

25:21.604 --> 25:24.232
God arranged things once again.

25:26.526 --> 25:30.446
When I had a rough time
at school or somewhere else -

25:30.530 --> 25:36.994
I imagined you'd show up
and take me away.

25:39.747 --> 25:43.000
I remember
you coming to see me once.

25:44.168 --> 25:48.548
At times I thought
it was just a dream.

25:49.882 --> 25:53.386
But it wasn't. It was you.

25:54.804 --> 26:00.017
You were in my room.
I was really little.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.021
You had long, curly hair -

26:04.105 --> 26:07.483
and you wanted us to learn to fly.

26:10.194 --> 26:13.030
I don't remember that.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.909
We flapped our arms, -

26:16.993 --> 26:20.871
even though I didn't believe
that would work.

26:21.414 --> 26:26.669
But you kept flapping your arms
and lifted up in the air a bit.

26:27.503 --> 26:32.091
Just a couple of centimeters.
I remember it clearly.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.642
I guess I flew then.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.806
That move at the end was great.

27:23.684 --> 27:27.688
Hi, Angela.
- Hi. Okay. Hi.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.316
Anna, let me talk to them a sec.

27:30.399 --> 27:34.278
Why don't you go check
if they have drinks for us.

27:37.114 --> 27:42.203
I don't have the whole amount yet,
but I'll get it.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.997
You better not bump
into Jakke anytime soon.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.584
He was pretty pissed off at you.

27:51.837 --> 27:55.841
Three weeks. After that
things won't be so friendly.

27:57.134 --> 28:01.347
I'm doing great. I'll get the money.
- Good.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.808
Seriously. No problem.

28:03.891 --> 28:09.689
I borrowed the money from a guy
who works at a club where I dance.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.942
He ran into problems,
so he sold my debt to those guys.

28:13.025 --> 28:19.073
Who are they?
- They work for this guy called Mertsi.

28:20.074 --> 28:24.620
He has a company. They work
as bouncers and things like that.

28:25.037 --> 28:32.169
They also do a bunch of other
things. Sell pills. And stuff.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.880
How much do you owe?

28:36.298 --> 28:39.468
About 30,000 euros.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.596
30,000?
- I just paid 4,000.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.809
Why'd you need so much?
- To start this group.

28:47.017 --> 28:50.813
I had to get costumes and put up
a website and everything.

28:51.522 --> 28:55.401
I'm not young anymore.
I had to do it now.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.654
I've done private shows for years.

28:58.738 --> 29:03.492
I've seen what happens to girls
when they get too old.

29:04.034 --> 29:07.580
Now that I've done these shows,
I can easily get solo gigs.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.915
I have connections.

29:10.124 --> 29:13.961
If you get 500 euros per gig,
and you owe 26,000 euros...

29:14.795 --> 29:18.758
...you have to do... 52 gigs.

29:23.179 --> 29:27.683
You calculated it just like that?
- You have to pay for gas, food...

29:32.146 --> 29:34.774
Well, this isn't your problem.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.153
Let's go.
We need to get some sleep.

29:39.945 --> 29:44.200
You can take a bus home
at 11 in the morning.

29:46.827 --> 29:49.205
I'll be fine.

30:01.342 --> 30:03.969
Hey! Hi.

30:05.554 --> 30:08.891
I have no idea who they were.

30:18.526 --> 30:22.196
I wonder how much he'd pay not
to have us post this online?

30:22.279 --> 30:24.156
At least a couple of thousands.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.368
Are you serious?
- I don't know.

30:28.285 --> 30:32.540
He'd know it was us.
- He wouldn't have any evidence.

30:32.623 --> 30:37.211
I'm sure he'll pay as long as
we don't ask for too much.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.340
Let me see the photo.

30:48.806 --> 30:53.227
Be serious.
Your bus is leaving soon.

30:56.272 --> 31:01.944
I don't want to go back.
I hate that bitch at the café.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.488
You don't have to go back there.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.745
I stayed because Dad was sick.

31:11.829 --> 31:14.832
There's nothing for me there.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.464
I could stay here.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.551
And you need that money.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.972
New multimedia message

31:30.055 --> 31:32.975
Sending...

31:37.646 --> 31:42.109
Five thousand, and that photo
will be deleted for good.

31:58.542 --> 32:03.297
"Your message is going
straight to the police."

32:03.380 --> 32:06.175
Shit. Anna.
Can he find out it's us?

32:07.217 --> 32:09.803
This is a prepaid number.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.516
Anna.

32:16.977 --> 32:20.773
This is your last chance,
before all your supporters, -

32:20.856 --> 32:24.902
family members
and Facebook friends see this.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.051
Now.

34:13.385 --> 34:18.389
Anna, you're
like some Bond villain.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.521
Well?

34:45.876 --> 34:48.337
Jakke. Your turn.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.130
Your turn.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.727
Message from Angela.

35:03.811 --> 35:07.856
She says
you'll get the rest on time.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.776
And a smiley face.

35:16.031 --> 35:19.409
The audience in Imatra
is always nice.

35:20.244 --> 35:24.498
And in Lappeenranta. Don't we have
a show there the clay after tomorrow?

35:24.581 --> 35:29.461
I've been thinking. Could you
offer the men a private dance?

35:29.545 --> 35:32.548
I would film it with my phone.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.846
Wouldn't that be a bit too nasty?

35:38.929 --> 35:42.808
First they'd pay for the dance,
and then we'd film them?

35:47.563 --> 35:50.149
Okay, we'll see.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.568
Now let's get some sleep.

35:57.239 --> 36:01.160
I have a photo for you, if you want it.
- What photo?

36:02.494 --> 36:05.122
Of Dad. You asked for one.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.717
It's from our boathouse.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.637
He liked fishing?

36:24.224 --> 36:28.437
We went often.
He let me steer the boat.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.442
You can have the photo.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.696
I don't need it.

36:47.206 --> 36:50.792
I've always had the best father.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.130
Would you pray with me?

37:04.556 --> 37:07.434
Dear Heavenly Father.
Thank You for today.

37:07.517 --> 37:11.230
Thank You for bringing us
to a safe haven once again.

37:11.313 --> 37:15.525
We are Your children
and servants. Amen.

38:45.365 --> 38:50.495
This house is awesome. It's really yours?
- Of course.

39:24.696 --> 39:29.117
Thank you. You're wonderful!
Remember to love each other!

39:41.630 --> 39:45.050
That looks like some space city.

39:45.634 --> 39:49.471
There's an even cooler place
behind it.

39:49.805 --> 39:51.973
You can almost see it from here.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.810
What place?
- Miami.

40:00.816 --> 40:03.026
It's there.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.363
That's where we're going.

40:15.622 --> 40:18.041
Let's never part ways.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.002
No.

40:23.004 --> 40:27.676
We need 8,000 euros more.
- Only 8,000? That's great.

40:28.009 --> 40:31.763
We'd have so much more money
if we hadn't spent...

40:31.847 --> 40:35.183
What's the point of living
if you can't enjoy it?

40:35.559 --> 40:39.271
Besides, I'm sure Jouni will
give us a couple of thousand.

40:39.438 --> 40:43.567
I'm happy you'll get to meet him.
He's really nice.

40:43.817 --> 40:48.947
We've been through a lot, but
I still feel he's the man in my life.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.061
Not that door. This one.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.148
Let's not wake him up.

41:28.278 --> 41:34.701
I've been sleeping here temporarily.
We both felt we needed some space.

41:34.784 --> 41:40.040
There's a sink in the corner.
The toilet is by the stairs.

41:41.249 --> 41:44.711
I know this seems weird,
but it's just for one night.

41:44.794 --> 41:47.839
<i>Is someone there?</i>
- Jouni.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.554
Hi.

41:56.848 --> 42:01.186
Jouni, this is my sister.
- Anna. Nice to meet you.

42:01.269 --> 42:05.941
You still have my keys?
- No, I took them from the hiding place.

42:08.818 --> 42:11.112
We had a gig in Kouvola yesterday.

42:11.196 --> 42:14.074
You could've come seen us.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.160
Honey.

42:17.494 --> 42:21.957
Hey...
- You can't do this.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.670
You promised to come get
your stuff by the end of the month.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.714
Sure.

42:32.467 --> 42:35.178
This is Mirkku.

42:35.554 --> 42:39.015
Oh, okay.
- This is Angela.

42:39.975 --> 42:41.643
Hi.

42:41.893 --> 42:45.689
And her sister.
- Hi.

42:45.772 --> 42:49.317
I like your earrings.
- Thanks.

42:50.777 --> 42:55.323
Okay. So did you come to get your stuff?
- Yeah.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.786
I was thinking
we'd crash here for the night.

42:59.869 --> 43:02.998
We have a long drive tomorrow.

43:07.877 --> 43:11.047
Well... Okay then.

43:12.257 --> 43:15.802
We'll go upstairs.
Mirkku has a morning shift.

43:15.885 --> 43:18.388
Good night.
- Good night.

43:27.105 --> 43:31.359
Thank You for today. Thank You
for everything You've given us.

43:31.443 --> 43:34.904
Thank You for bringing us
to a safe haven once again.

43:34.988 --> 43:40.368
We are Your children and servants. Amen.
- Amen.

43:47.751 --> 43:54.132
We'll get the money.
Then we can travel somewhere.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.885
Thanks, sweetie.

44:01.681 --> 44:03.725
What's this?

44:06.603 --> 44:08.897
D for Doris.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.068
My daughter.

44:15.028 --> 44:18.782
You have a child?
- Yeah.

44:26.247 --> 44:29.042
But she doesn't live with me.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.961
She has this...

44:34.255 --> 44:37.592
...really good foster family.

44:41.137 --> 44:48.061
I get to call her every now and then
and ask how she's doing.

44:56.319 --> 44:59.572
So everything turned out
really well.

45:06.079 --> 45:08.748
Let's get some sleep, okay?

45:32.230 --> 45:34.190
I'll call.

45:40.572 --> 45:43.116
Two thousand.

45:43.199 --> 45:46.536
I told him you thought Mirkku was weird.
- What?

45:46.619 --> 45:49.539
I had to make
some kind of comment about her.

45:54.043 --> 45:57.464
So you're touring with her now?
- Yeah.

45:57.881 --> 46:01.176
It's good someone looks after her.

46:01.259 --> 46:04.721
I mean, she's... Angela.

46:07.599 --> 46:11.853
Sometimes, with her,
it's like being high on coke.

46:11.936 --> 46:14.272
The sun just keeps shining.

46:14.355 --> 46:20.487
But then she gets these... ideas.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.822
Err...

46:23.490 --> 46:26.993
I have to keep away from her.

46:28.119 --> 46:30.288
I'm doing well now.

46:31.539 --> 46:34.292
And you, just so you know, -

46:36.461 --> 46:40.173
be careful.
- She's my sister.

46:48.348 --> 46:51.726
Here you go. Bye, hon.

47:13.456 --> 47:15.291
Excuse me, you have the stick?

47:15.375 --> 47:19.337
What?
- The stick with your music on it.

47:19.420 --> 47:24.467
Oh. Yeah.
All the songs are in one file.

47:24.551 --> 47:28.179
They're in the right order.
- Okay.

47:28.680 --> 47:32.767
My name is Timi.
- Anna.

47:33.101 --> 47:34.853
Okay.

47:45.363 --> 47:48.867
Is there going to be a big crowd tonight?
- Pretty big.

48:11.264 --> 48:15.894
Have you worked here a long time?
- No. It's just a part-time thing.

48:15.977 --> 48:19.022
It's part of my studies.
- Oh.

48:19.105 --> 48:21.566
Are you going to be a bartender?

48:23.192 --> 48:29.449
I'm more interested in music.
The technical side of it. - Okay.

48:36.122 --> 48:38.499
This is my last day here.

48:41.252 --> 48:44.339
You have a reason
to celebrate then.

48:44.589 --> 48:47.550
We could raise a toast
after the show.

50:38.119 --> 50:41.831
We have the money.
- You have to speak louder.

50:45.126 --> 50:48.004
We have the money.
Or, at least, most of it.

50:48.087 --> 50:52.216
These kinds of places
are difficult.

50:52.300 --> 50:55.762
My hearing aid
doesn't work that well.

50:57.722 --> 51:01.809
We have the money.
- I don't work for Mertsi anymore.

51:03.895 --> 51:06.606
I kinda got fired.

51:07.565 --> 51:10.026
It was the second blow.

51:13.321 --> 51:16.199
My other ear was already bad.

51:16.282 --> 51:20.411
After I lost 60 percent
of the hearing in my good ear, -

51:20.495 --> 51:23.164
I became pretty useless.

51:25.416 --> 51:29.670
What do you want then?
- I don't know.

51:30.713 --> 51:33.174
I don't fucking know.

51:37.303 --> 51:42.642
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

51:45.144 --> 51:48.022
It's my debt, not Anna's!
- We were just talking...

51:48.106 --> 51:51.526
Don't come here threatening us.
We did what we promised.

51:51.609 --> 51:55.113
Leave Anna alone!

51:55.196 --> 51:58.699
Was I threatening you?
- Hey...

52:12.755 --> 52:14.966
Get in!

52:31.274 --> 52:33.985
Should we call Mertsi?

52:36.487 --> 52:39.532
We need to sort things out
somehow.

52:41.868 --> 52:44.328
How about we think
about it tomorrow.

52:45.371 --> 52:48.374
What are we going to do with Timi?

52:49.041 --> 52:51.586
Can't he stay here?

52:54.255 --> 52:56.674
He's sweet.
- We need to leave early.

52:56.757 --> 52:58.634
Yeah, yeah.

53:09.061 --> 53:15.443
I should start walking home.
- No, you shouldn't. Come on in.

53:29.040 --> 53:35.796
I'll step outside for a moment
and give you the room.

53:45.056 --> 53:49.477
You want to sit down?
- Yes. Thanks.

53:57.360 --> 54:01.656
You want something to drink?
- Sure, why not.

54:11.332 --> 54:16.087
Aren't those expensive?
- That's okay.

54:34.272 --> 54:36.899
What kind of music
would you like to make?

54:36.983 --> 54:43.114
Like folk stuff combined
with electronic or...

54:45.783 --> 54:47.576
What?

54:49.787 --> 54:52.540
You're so sweet
just the way you are now.

59:50.296 --> 59:54.508
Anna! Shouldn't you be in bed?

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:05.436
Hey, go back to bed.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:17.948
Everything's okay.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:09.096
You want me to go to the police?

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.362
What about Mertsi?

01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:30.075
We have three days.
Let's just get the money.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.042
And if they find him?
- They won't.

01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:47.718
He went crazy in the bar, and
that's the last we saw of him, okay?

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.637
We'll go get the stuff
we left at the club.

01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:55.475
Then we'll drive to the next gig
just as we normally would.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.935
Are you filming?
- I was just...

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:51.188
What the hell?

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:55.609
Get your hands off her!

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.903
Anna, come!

01:10:06.328 --> 01:10:07.996
Come!

01:10:35.065 --> 01:10:37.108
Let me go!

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:46.534
Oh hi. Hi.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:51.373
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Is this your house?

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:55.794
We had this situation...
- Hey! Anna!

01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:05.178
You feel like throwing up, sweetie?
- I don't know.

01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:09.266
I think it's just a concussion.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:17.065
Why don't you rest for a moment.

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:20.568
A car will come pick you up
in a couple of hours. - Okay.

01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:23.446
Stay here until it comes.
- Thank you.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.830
What happened?

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:34.749
Just sleep.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:56.956
Oh, sorry.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.042
I couldn't sleep.

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:08.760
This is a really nice place.
You have trouble sleeping as well?

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:20.230
One should trust God,
but one still worries about things.

01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:24.067
Yes.

01:13:26.444 --> 01:13:29.030
Our Lady of Kazan.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.659
She who shows the way.

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:39.707
It's from the 1500s.

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:44.963
Does this one do miracles too?

01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:52.554
I hope so.

01:13:55.557 --> 01:13:59.185
Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:03.106
Thanks.

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:15.535
So they drove you away
from your congregation? - Yeah.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:20.790
We... I mean,
they have pretty strict rules.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:24.544
They were actually
everything I had.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:32.385
Because my mother
was a bit... unstable.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:36.431
So the people from the congregation
were like family to me.

01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:42.061
I don't even know
how they found out -

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:45.690
that I had started dancing
at this club, -

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:48.193
but somehow they always do.

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:56.826
I prayed they'd take me back.

01:14:56.910 --> 01:15:00.121
I confessed and everything, but no.

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:08.963
For a while after that
all kinds of things happened.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:19.682
But then God spoke to me.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:23.603
And I realized they don't own Him.

01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:29.901
God is mine. And I'm God's.

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:33.488
Exactly the way I am.

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:41.454
Now He gave me Anna, my sister.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:52.632
Have you always had faith?
- No.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:57.762
Sometimes I find it -

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:01.724
but then I lose it again.

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:07.814
I... doubt.

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:15.321
Maybe that's why I was sent here.
To give you reassurance.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:22.203
<i>Or 'gust to cheer you up.</i>

01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:37.051
Well?
- Not yet.

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.396
Okay, you can come.

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:53.401
Wow.

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:57.238
Okay.

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:04.180
Excuse me.
Let's continue some other time.

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:39.507
We'll be at the hotel soon,
and you can go back to sleep.

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.806
For the dance.
- Oh.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:51.477
Thanks. I left a scarf upstairs.
I'll go get it.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:01.738
Anna, there's tons of money in here.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:12.206
Sometimes I'm amazed at
the strange paths God takes us down.

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:14.834
And everything just works out.

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:21.507
What?

01:19:25.136 --> 01:19:27.513
Anna.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:34.437
Jakke was not a good man.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:45.633
Should we take Highway 6?
Or stay on this?

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:48.094
That's a pretty cool bike.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:53.808
Hey.
- I don't know. I don't care.

01:21:03.401 --> 01:21:05.736
Look.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:11.742
Baltkraft Owner's Shady Past

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.585
What?

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:36.601
Wouldn't it be best
if I talked to him?

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:53.409
Yes?
- May I speak to Mertsi.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:58.289
Who's <i>asking?</i> - Angela's sister.
I need to talk about her debt.

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:00.583
<i>I don't know anyone called Angela.</i>

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:04.003
We have thirty grand.

01:22:10.885 --> 01:22:12.762
Angela's sister.

01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:17.475
Yes?

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:20.478
<i>This is Angela 's sister.
- Yea</i> h?

01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:23.856
<i>We'll pay. This doesn't
have to go any further.</i>

01:22:25.191 --> 01:22:28.277
We have almost thirty grand.
We're getting the rest soon.

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:32.573
I lent her thirty grand.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:22:33.032 --> 01:22:36.744
<i>Did it cross your mind
she needs to pay interest?</i>

01:22:38.788 --> 01:22:41.707
Or do you think I do this for fun?

01:22:43.084 --> 01:22:47.088
H <i>ow</i> m u <i>ch?
- 20 percent per month.</i>

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:51.759
<i>It's so late I don't even
want to count how much.</i>

01:22:52.927 --> 01:22:56.305
<i>I don't think
I want your money anymore.</i>

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:04.730
We'll give you forty-five grand
in a week.

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:08.859
<i>You want it? Or do you
prefer beating women up?</i>

01:23:08.943 --> 01:23:11.028
Fifty.

01:23:11.696 --> 01:23:13.948
<i>And now you're on the hook as well.</i>

01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:36.429
I knew there'd be interest, but
I didn't realize it was that much.

01:23:41.142 --> 01:23:44.937
Did I leave the door open?
- Where is it?

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:50.943
Where the fuck is the bag?
- I'm sure I locked the door.

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:55.364
Where's the bag?
- It's there.

01:23:57.742 --> 01:24:01.662
I'm sure I locked the door.

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:16.135
I'm sure I locked the door.

01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:25.895
Anna.

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:17.905
Anna, I'm getting cold.

01:25:42.263 --> 01:25:47.643
Let's just go somewhere.
Somewhere far away.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:53.149
We don't have any money.

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:59.738
Give me your phone.

01:26:04.869 --> 01:26:08.164
Let's see if we can
come up with something.

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:21.510
There might be something
we can still use.

01:26:23.262 --> 01:26:25.431
What's this?

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:43.908
Well? I came to see you, but
I want to tell you right away that -

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:48.120
if this is about
what I think it is...

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:51.165
I can't help you.

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:54.710
Eduard Richter.
- I don't know him.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:59.924
How much will we ask for?
- Enough to get away.

01:27:00.007 --> 01:27:04.803
Then we wouldn't have to pay Mertsi.
- We'll take care of it first.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:37.253
<i>I'd like to offer you my help.
- I really don't want to know.</i>

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:42.132
<i>I know you've applied
for an important position.</i>

01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:44.802
<i>You could help me.
- Maybe.</i>

01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:50.724
<i>I have friends. You need support.
For example, from Russia...</i>

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:54.228
You sure?

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:48.324
Miami, all airports

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:50.993
This is good. Departure at 9:50 p.m.

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:54.747
When does it arrive?
- At 5 a.m.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:58.584
We'll head to the beach
and have breakfast at a beach bar.

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:17.978
It wasn't because of my mom
that I didn't visit you anymore.

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:25.694
Dad didn't want me to.

01:29:29.365 --> 01:29:32.576
He was afraid
I'd do something to you.

01:29:35.412 --> 01:29:37.790
It was a stupid thing.

01:29:42.336 --> 01:29:44.421
We were bathing you.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:48.342
Then Dad went somewhere.

01:29:48.425 --> 01:29:51.428
When he came back,
you were underwater.

01:29:55.099 --> 01:29:58.394
He thought I did it on purpose.

01:30:05.943 --> 01:30:08.070
Well.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.992
I don't know
what made me think of that.

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:03.292
See that queue for the taxi?

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:10.966
Start walking calmly towards it.

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:15.012
Don't do anything that'll draw attention.
- Attention to me?

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:24.480
Tell the taxi driver to head
towards the Tuusula Highway.

01:31:24.563 --> 01:31:27.274
I'll send you a text
about where to pick me up.

01:31:27.357 --> 01:31:30.861
You'll check with me...?
- No, you'll check with me!

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:46.168
You'll pick me up,
and we'll drive to the airport.

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:50.380
What if I don't get
a text from you? Anna?

01:32:01.767 --> 01:32:03.560
You will.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:06.313
What if we make it
to the airport before that?

01:32:06.396 --> 01:32:11.860
If you don't get a message from me,
take the first flight to Miami.

01:32:20.452 --> 01:32:24.122
Do You give
only to then take away?

01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:34.049
Get ready.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:39.680
Why did you buy a value ticket?
- What?

01:32:39.763 --> 01:32:43.684
You bought a value ticket to Miami.
It's more expensive.

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:48.939
You bought it because
it can be canceled?

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:53.652
What are you talking about?
We're in a hurry.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:10.043
What are you doing?

01:33:10.127 --> 01:33:13.171
Hey. What are you doing?

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:16.383
<i>So you're not coming with me.</i>

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:18.719
<i>Where'?
- To Miami.</i>

01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:22.723
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm coming.

01:33:23.682 --> 01:33:26.810
Seriously.
We don't have time for this.

01:33:26.893 --> 01:33:29.855
Open the door, Angela.

01:33:35.152 --> 01:33:38.280
Seriously. We're in a hurry.
Open the door!

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:40.824
<i>Daddy's little princess.</i>

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:44.620
What are you talking about?

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:47.873
<i>I got all your letters.</i>

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:57.299
<i>"Dear Angela,
Dad took me to the boat today."</i>

01:33:59.509 --> 01:34:02.095
<i>"Dad built me a dollhouse."</i>

01:34:05.599 --> 01:34:08.602
What are you talking about?
- Be <i>quiet!</i>

01:34:11.313 --> 01:34:14.191
<i>Be quiet.</i>

01:34:20.614 --> 01:34:23.992
<i>Angela, you need to calm down.</i>

01:34:28.205 --> 01:34:32.000
<i>Why did you look for me
if you're just going to leave?</i>

01:34:38.674 --> 01:34:42.469
<i>I'm coming with you.
- Don 't lie to me./</i>

01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:55.816
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

01:35:00.821 --> 01:35:05.158
Angela, please. Let me out.

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:09.204
I'm not going anywhere.

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.335
Trust me.

01:35:16.002 --> 01:35:18.839
<i>We're going to Miami soon.</i>

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:22.092
<i>You and me.</i>

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:40.402
Everything's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:35:40.569 --> 01:35:42.654
I'm sorry.

01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:49.578
You've changed everything
in my life, you know.

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:58.920
Why did you buy
the value ticket then?

01:36:02.132 --> 01:36:07.179
Angela. You have to do
everything exactly as we agreed.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:11.516
You understand?
Exactly as we agreed.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.394
Otherwise we won't make it.

01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:17.522
Pack your stuff quickly.

01:37:56.872 --> 01:37:59.499
God bless you.

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:35.619
The Lord sees you! The Lord
hears you! Accept God's love!

01:38:35.702 --> 01:38:38.914
God won't abandon you!
Accept God's love!

01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:41.499
God listens to you!

01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:43.376
God listens to you!

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:47.756
Accept God's love!
Don't be alone!

01:38:47.839 --> 01:38:51.593
Trust God! Accept God's love!

01:39:04.314 --> 01:39:07.651
Accept God's love!

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:18.536
God's love...

01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:07.288
I'm looking for Mertsi.

01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:11.417
Hi.

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:22.762
So you're really Angela's sister.

01:42:31.312 --> 01:42:33.731
Okay. Wait.

01:42:33.815 --> 01:42:35.567
Stay and eat with us.

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:40.405
It's a bit chilly, but we have blankets.
- I don't have time.

01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:43.491
Too bad.

01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:06.848
We should get going...
- just a moment. She'll call me.

01:43:09.017 --> 01:43:11.978
All right.

01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:24.282
God is the same, after all.

01:43:28.912 --> 01:43:32.957
Could one of you please
walk me out?

01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:42.986
To the airport, Terminal 2, please.

01:45:07.302 --> 01:45:09.679
This hair looks good on you.

01:45:11.973 --> 01:45:15.059
Your bone structure is
so beautiful.

01:45:28.531 --> 01:45:31.284
Sweetie, everything's okay.

01:45:35.163 --> 01:45:36.914
I'm sorry.

01:45:49.802 --> 01:45:52.430
Everything's okay, sweetie.

01:45:52.597 --> 01:45:55.767
Hey. We'll always be together.

01:45:56.893 --> 01:46:00.355
Even if we're not in the same place.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.779
You can come to Miami later.

01:48:44.227 --> 01:48:47.605
Sweetie, look at me.

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:49.941
Sweetie, just look at me.

01:48:51.067 --> 01:48:54.111
When they're not looking, run.

01:48:55.196 --> 01:48:59.200
Go to the car and drive.

01:48:59.492 --> 01:49:02.245
Drive straight to the airport.

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:06.916
Promise me.

01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:10.962
Good.

01:49:13.673 --> 01:49:16.259
I'll meet you there.

01:54:07.758 --> 01:54:12.680
<i>Minister Junell has been appointed
executive director of UN Women.</i>

01:54:12.763 --> 01:54:16.934
<i>Meanwhile, the Baltkraft wind farm
was opened today.</i>

01:54:44.753 --> 01:54:49.884
How warm is it there this time of the year?
- Really warm.

01:54:51.093 --> 01:54:54.513
She's been waiting for you
and writing you letters, -

01:54:54.597 --> 01:54:58.893
asking me all the time,
"When is my aunt coming?"

01:54:59.852 --> 01:55:03.522
Dodo. Dodo, hey. Anna's here.

01:55:03.814 --> 01:55:07.484
She calls herself Dodo,
so we also started calling her that.
