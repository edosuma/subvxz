WEBVTT

00:01.936 --> 00:04.269
(blows whistle)
sloppy babies!

00:04.271 --> 00:07.773
You're all sloppy babies!

00:07.775 --> 00:10.609
How do you expect to pass
the presidential fitness test

00:10.611 --> 00:13.145
When all you do is sit
on your enormous rumps

00:13.147 --> 00:14.813
Playing<i> grand theft auto</i>
all day,

00:14.815 --> 00:17.449
While picking at a forehead
full of pimples

00:17.451 --> 00:19.852
No doubt caused by consuming

00:19.854 --> 00:22.121
An entire bag of funyuns
in one sitting?

00:22.123 --> 00:25.524
Michael phelps did not win
18 gold medals

00:25.526 --> 00:27.960
By swimming through a pool
of pork rinds!

00:27.962 --> 00:29.628
You think this is hard?

00:29.630 --> 00:33.966
Try consuming your own twin
in utero! That's hard!

00:33.968 --> 00:35.968
(blows whistle)
i'm not leaving here

00:35.970 --> 00:38.871
Until at least three of you
pass out or puke!

00:38.873 --> 00:40.305
If your hands aren't bleeding,

00:40.307 --> 00:41.707
You're not doing it right.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.475
Mark my words,

00:43.477 --> 00:45.144
Every kid at this school

00:45.146 --> 00:46.979
Will make it up
to the top of that rope

00:46.981 --> 00:48.480
Or they will not graduate!

00:48.482 --> 00:50.816
Hey, look, everyone.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.151
It's puffy's turn.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.987
Come on, everybody,
gather round.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.555
All right,
wiggle tush,

00:56.557 --> 00:58.991
Pretend there's a bucket
of butterscotch pudding

00:58.993 --> 01:00.559
At the top of that rope.
Go!

01:01.529 --> 01:03.495
Come on.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.003
(laughter)

01:11.005 --> 01:11.937
Hey!

01:11.939 --> 01:14.006
Sue:
You, sir,

01:14.008 --> 01:15.741
Are a disgrace to yourself,

01:15.743 --> 01:17.776
Your school
and your nation.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.012
Sue, i think roderick
needs to rest for a minute.

01:20.014 --> 01:22.281
Oh, absolutely, sheldon.
Let's reward failure.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.782
Because while america
is struggling

01:23.784 --> 01:25.050
With type 2
diabetes,

01:25.052 --> 01:27.386
China is
colonizing mars.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.521
Not on my watch!

01:29.523 --> 01:30.556
All right,
double stuf, come on.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.057
Hoist yourself
up there again.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.425
Beiste:
Come on, lad.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.061
Sue:
And hike up your
shorts, please,

01:36.063 --> 01:39.031
Before some poor soul
falls into your butt crack.

01:39.033 --> 01:42.101
(students laughing)

01:42.103 --> 01:44.470
(school bell ringing)

01:46.640 --> 01:47.940
Whoa.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.243
We have a problem.
We do?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.878
What's, uh, what's wrong?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.080
You can't climb a rope,
you can't do a push-up,

01:55.082 --> 01:56.548
You can't even do
simple choreography.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.583
If i'm gonna
be part of this

01:57.585 --> 01:59.118
Whole glee club thing,

01:59.120 --> 02:00.419
It behooves me

02:00.421 --> 02:01.753
To not be strapped
to a lead weight.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.890
Spoiler:
You're the lead weight.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.925
Okay, then...
Maybe you could help me?

02:06.927 --> 02:08.494
Sorry. What?

02:08.496 --> 02:10.162
Maybe you could help me?

02:10.164 --> 02:11.997
I mean, i could, you know,
try to do better, but...

02:11.999 --> 02:13.999
Cool, yeah.
Try to try.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.400
Try to try.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.835
Just...
If you just tried,

02:16.837 --> 02:18.670
It'd be great.
And you know what?

02:18.672 --> 02:20.839
Wait. Stop eating
those gummy bears.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.274
Come on.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.243
Hey.
Hey.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.745
How you doing?
Roderick: I'm okay.
How are you?

02:26.747 --> 02:27.946
Good.
A little tired.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.515
Yeah?
Stayed up
late last night.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.749
I was watching
that, um, the yeti...

02:30.751 --> 02:32.284
Roderick:
The yeti thing.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.586
Yeah!
Yeah. Me, too.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.422
(laughs)

02:37.424 --> 02:39.458
Oh, yeah, i just feel
like it was awesome.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.426
Roderick:
That was the coolest episode
of a tv show i've seen.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.362
It was so...
Bigfoot, on
the other hand...

02:43.364 --> 02:44.596
100% possible.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.265
Hey, buddy.
I gotta pick up

02:46.267 --> 02:48.433
Some sheet music
from you after class.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.369
Hey, man, 'sup?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.271
I'm spencer.
'sup?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.805
You're alistair, right?
Wait.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.207
You guys are friends?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.375
Me and hot rod?
Hells, yeah.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.277
We're in
the glee club together.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.112
We work out all the time
together, too.

03:00.114 --> 03:03.348
I'm kind of like his personal
trainer and his inspiration.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.485
Check it out.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.720
Go ahead. You can touch
the guns if you want.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.289
Don't worry. Safety's on.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.357
Um...

03:12.359 --> 03:14.126
I think i forgot
something in my locker.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.527
Yeah.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.895
I'll be right back,
roderick.
Yeah.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.298
Cool.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.300
What was that?
Were you just

03:21.302 --> 03:23.302
Flirting with him?
Was that you flirting?

03:23.304 --> 03:25.237
You wouldn't understand.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.505
You're not a player like me.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.340
Well, that was

03:28.342 --> 03:29.741
The weirdest thing
i've ever seen.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.977
If you think
that was romantic,

03:31.979 --> 03:33.512
Then you're not a player,

03:33.514 --> 03:35.214
You're kind of a creeper.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.548
Ugh.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.589
Superintendent harris,
it's no secret that

03:43.591 --> 03:45.924
Before i became principal
at mckinley high,

03:45.926 --> 03:47.593
Well, our students were dumber

03:47.595 --> 03:48.927
Than alabama first graders.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.195
But now,

03:50.197 --> 03:52.397
Not only have
test scores skyrocketed,

03:52.399 --> 03:55.534
But we have become the most
tech-savvy school in america,

03:55.536 --> 03:57.269
Due to my close
personal relationship

03:57.271 --> 03:58.737
With the koch brothers,

03:58.739 --> 04:02.407
Who generously donated
a special ops drone,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.509
Which should be flying
by right about now.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.351
You never cease to amaze me.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.086
Well, thank you,
superintendent.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.187
Listen,

04:15.189 --> 04:16.922
I have a tiny favor to ask you.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.523
I have humbly
submitted myself

04:18.525 --> 04:21.860
For the united states
principal of the year award.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.963
It's the type of award that
would make a résumé sparkle.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.598
The icing on the cake

04:26.600 --> 04:28.634
After all of my years
here at mckinley high.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.103
Well, you're not planning
on leaving us, are you?

04:31.105 --> 04:32.804
Oh, no. No, absolutely not.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.473
Don't believe everything
becky jackson tweets.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.308
Uh, the only
thing i need

04:36.310 --> 04:37.709
To complete my application

04:37.711 --> 04:39.211
Is a letter of recommendation.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.445
From you.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.980
Which i have right here.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.448
(chuckles)

04:48.055 --> 04:49.321
(clears throat)
i will need to, uh,

04:49.323 --> 04:50.555
Review this, of course.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.657
In the meantime,

04:51.659 --> 04:52.891
I have a favor

04:52.893 --> 04:54.192
I'd like to ask of you.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.131
Glee club, william, frodo...

04:59.133 --> 05:00.399
This fine young man

05:00.401 --> 05:01.900
Standing next to me

05:01.902 --> 05:03.235
Is superintendent harris's

05:03.237 --> 05:04.469
One and only nephew,

05:04.471 --> 05:05.804
Mr. Myron muskovitz.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.072
Hey.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.440
(sue chuckles)

05:08.442 --> 05:10.075
Myron is about to celebrate

05:10.077 --> 05:12.110
The most important day
in a jewish boy's life:

05:12.112 --> 05:13.745
His bar mitzvah.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.080
It's a sacred ritual

05:15.082 --> 05:16.315
In which he
becomes a man

05:16.317 --> 05:19.318
And, thus, a full-fledged member

05:19.320 --> 05:20.952
Of the, uh, jewish community.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.487
And i'm putting on a show.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.989
Sue (chuckling):
Okay.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.424
Myron will be
performing

05:25.426 --> 05:27.426
A little musical number
at his bar mitzvah party,

05:27.428 --> 05:29.294
And he would very much
appreciate it

05:29.296 --> 05:30.762
If you would give him
any pointers.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.130
And did i mention

05:32.132 --> 05:34.766
He's the superintendent's
nephew?

05:34.768 --> 05:35.834
Okay.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.602
Okay, so this is just rehearsal,

05:37.604 --> 05:38.837
So be kind.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.971
Lights!

05:39.973 --> 05:41.673
Hit me!

05:41.675 --> 05:44.943
(destiny's child's
"lose my breath" begins)

05:44.945 --> 05:48.647
¶ can you keep up, baby boy? ¶
¶<i> make me lose my breath</i> ¶

05:48.649 --> 05:50.515

07:05.692 --> 07:07.125
(applause)

07:07.127 --> 07:08.627
(whoops)
wow! Wow!

07:08.629 --> 07:10.295
(laughing)

07:10.297 --> 07:11.530
That was amazing.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.798
Myron, you are very talented.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.366
Oh, thank you, miss berry.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.134
I'm a huge fan,
so that means the world to me.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.536
But here's
the rub:

07:17.538 --> 07:19.571
I want my bar mitzvah
to be perfect.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.072
Not good, not great-- perfect.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.707
How can i improve this number?

07:22.709 --> 07:24.042
Seriously, give me notes.
Anything.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.077
Um... Maybe your dancers

07:26.079 --> 07:27.879
Could just smile
a little bit more?

07:27.881 --> 07:28.814
Yeah.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.048
Okay, exactly.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.249
I-i already told them that.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.384
I already told you that!

07:32.386 --> 07:33.652
What's wrong with you people?

07:33.654 --> 07:35.387
You know, i thought
i hired professionals,

07:35.389 --> 07:36.888
But obviously, i was mistaken.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.557
You're fired!
Get off this stage!

07:38.559 --> 07:39.624
Now, bitches!

07:41.562 --> 07:43.094
May i speak with the adults,
please?

07:43.096 --> 07:45.564
Do anything
he asks.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.332
(laughs)

07:47.334 --> 07:49.901
This stage is sheer heaven.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.903
My uncle said i could
use it for my party

07:51.905 --> 07:53.905
If it's okay with you.
Please?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.173
Of course you can.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.408
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.609
You're my new best friend.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.844
Mmm.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.412
Now, best friend,
i'd also like

08:00.414 --> 08:01.913
The glee club
doing my opening act.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.615
And i'd also be happy
to pay them--

08:03.617 --> 08:05.350
Say, 20 grand?

08:05.352 --> 08:06.852
What? Tw... Um...

08:06.854 --> 08:09.421
Wow, that's...
That's very generous.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.189
But, uh, unfortunately
show choir bylaws

08:11.191 --> 08:13.158
Forbid us from accepting
any compensation.
Myron:
Okay.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.193
Then you could do it for free.
It'll give your kids

08:15.195 --> 08:16.795
Invaluable stage experience.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.663
Doesn't that
sound fun?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.932
Hey, i thought i told you
to leave, skank!

08:20.934 --> 08:22.534
Now! Go!

08:23.804 --> 08:25.537
Uh, myron,
although we would usually

08:25.539 --> 08:27.772
Jump at the opportunity
to perform,

08:27.774 --> 08:30.108
Right now we're just really busy
practicing for sectionals.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.543
They accept.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.944
(sue chuckles)

08:35.215 --> 08:37.449
(school bell ringing)
knock, knock.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.817
Oh.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.051
Hey, mason.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.620
Hey.
How's it going?

08:41.622 --> 08:42.888
Well, i've been better.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.322
I got a "c" on my math test.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.725
When i have a bad day,
i usually drown my sorrows

08:46.727 --> 08:48.293
In endless breadsticks
at breadstix.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.528
Hmm. It is as
good as they say?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.029
Have you
never been?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.631
No, my mom says
it's infested with cockroaches.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.865
Oh, no, it's okay.
They fumigated.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.200
Maybe i could
take you next week?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.701
I could teach you
how to eat your feelings.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.403
Mmm, where are
we eating?

08:58.405 --> 08:59.971
Um, breadstix.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.206
Breadstix?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.208
No. No, mason,
we talked about this.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.243
It's crunch time
in cheerios! Season.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.811
We're completely
overhauling your diet.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.079
No carbs.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.048
We need you
lean and mean.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.483
Jane, it was nice
talking to you.

09:11.485 --> 09:12.617
Walk me to class?

09:15.822 --> 09:17.088
Thanks for coming, guys.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.423
I have kind of
a weird problem,

09:18.425 --> 09:20.058
So i'd prefer if it
stays in this room.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.427
I've been trying to talk
to jane a little lately,

09:22.429 --> 09:25.497
Um, 'cause she's really talented
and gorgeous,

09:25.499 --> 09:26.998
But i'm having some trouble.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.167
Can i be dismissed?
Women are weird

09:29.169 --> 09:31.236
And mysterious creatures
and i'm bored.
No. No, no, no.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.238
Listen, look...
I want to take jane out,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.240
But my sister
is screwing everything up.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.741
Wait, aren't
you guys dating?

09:36.743 --> 09:37.842
Ha, ha.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.244
I'm just kidding.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.845
But seriously,
aren't you guys dating?

09:40.847 --> 09:43.014
No, come on. We didn't
have it easy growing up.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.951
Our parents were more concerned
with performing

09:45.953 --> 09:47.352
Than being parents,

09:47.354 --> 09:49.187
So madison kind of acted
like a second mom.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.690
She's been treating me like
a small child my entire life.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.857
Every second of every day,
she's there.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.125
I-i just can't function.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.861
So, i need her out of my way.
For a bit.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.297
One of you two needs
to ask her out and distract her.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.533
Well, i'm not an option,
for obvious reasons,

10:01.535 --> 10:04.035
So, no, but...

10:04.037 --> 10:06.304
Dude, you just got done telling
us how crazy your sister is.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.706
I-i'm sorry, but no way.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.775
Come on, guys, help me out here.
Help yourself.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.377
Tell her to back off
so you can score some tail.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.979
Simple. And you...

10:13.981 --> 10:15.880
You're gonna meet me
in the gym after school,

10:15.882 --> 10:17.315
So that i can whip your ass
into shape.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.784
Then you're gonna help me
get a date with my boy.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.487
How did this become
about you guys?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.556
So i was thinking for
the bar mitzvah, since myron is

10:24.558 --> 10:27.125
Very theatrical, that
the glee club could hit him up

10:27.127 --> 10:29.394
With some broadway,
but, like, modern,

10:29.396 --> 10:31.963
Downtown, up-tempo stuff.
Do these kids
even like broadway?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.398
I don't know some
of the new ones.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.567
What are they like?
Um...

10:35.569 --> 10:37.402
I mean, they're great.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.637
They're so nice.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.405
Such a vibrant group.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.007
So energetic.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.575
But they're quiet, you know?

10:43.577 --> 10:44.809
They're very, like...

10:44.811 --> 10:46.411
You know, within themselves.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.313
Quiet... Because
you're always talking?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.814
You think i'm the worst.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.082
No, rachel...

10:51.084 --> 10:52.350
No. Not at all.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.585
I think this
bar mitzvah

10:53.587 --> 10:55.320
Is exactly the challenge
they need right now.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.588
Performing in front
of a big audience

10:56.590 --> 10:57.989
Will force them
to band together.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.924
But if you don't
know them very well...

10:59.926 --> 11:01.192
I don't know.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.494
Maybe it's time to push them

11:02.496 --> 11:03.795
To make some choices themselves.

11:03.797 --> 11:04.963
(school bell rings)

11:04.965 --> 11:06.097
Rachel:
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

11:06.099 --> 11:07.265
Take your seats.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.333
We have some
really exciting news.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.801
So, myron really liked

11:09.803 --> 11:11.136
Our suggestions.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.104
And he has decided
to have us perform

11:13.106 --> 11:14.139
At his bar mitzvah!

11:14.141 --> 11:16.508
Can you believe it?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.610
You guys, i thought that
you'd be more excited.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.278
So, you want us
to sing at a spoiled

11:20.280 --> 11:21.613
Little rich kid's
birthday party?

11:21.615 --> 11:23.014
It's a bar mitzvah.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.784
Have you guys had any
jewish life experiences?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.452
This is a sacred honor.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.454
Guys, why aren't you
more excited about this?

11:29.456 --> 11:31.022
Are we actually gonna sing
or are you about

11:31.024 --> 11:32.791
To announce an alumnus
walking through the door?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.492
No, this is all about you guys.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.028
Myron is trusting us
and we are trusting you.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.297
That's right!
The clock is ticking.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.532
Sectionals is in
two weeks, guys.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.800
Don't underestimate
this challenge.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.802
There is no tougher
audience than...

11:43.804 --> 11:45.970
Jews!
Tweens.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.706
Vicious, pubescent tweens
with zero tolerance

11:47.708 --> 11:48.973
For a bad act.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.341
So, pair up, triple up,

11:50.343 --> 11:51.843
Pick some songs,
this is gonna be great.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.977
We want upbeat.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.312
We want energy.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.480
We want epic!
All right!

11:55.482 --> 11:57.716
(indistinct chatter)

12:00.153 --> 12:01.720
This is incredible!

12:01.722 --> 12:03.021
Were we not just
talking about doing

12:03.023 --> 12:04.055
Gender role-reversal duets?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.056
Were we not?!

12:05.058 --> 12:06.558
Mason, i'm freaking out!

12:06.560 --> 12:08.159
Well, my short list is
actually a long one,

12:08.161 --> 12:09.728
So we should really start
brainstorming now.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.162
Hello?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.363
Focus-- huge

12:12.365 --> 12:13.765
Opportunity knocking
at the front door!

12:13.767 --> 12:15.066
Yeah, yeah. I'm in.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.936
Grab a chair.
Yeah, i'm in.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.343
(school bell ringing)

12:32.352 --> 12:34.419
You know the best thing
about being a dude?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.855
I'm eating my chicken for lunch.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.223
But later,

12:38.225 --> 12:41.126
If i lick my lips like this,

12:41.128 --> 12:43.528
Mmm, i'm tasting it all day.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.331
Mmm!

12:50.403 --> 12:51.703
Hey, sue?

12:51.705 --> 12:52.904
You-you doing okay?

12:52.906 --> 12:53.972
No, actually, uh...

12:53.974 --> 12:55.240
(clears her throat, sniffs)

12:55.242 --> 12:56.875
I haven't slept for three days.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.942
Mind if i put my coffee down

12:57.944 --> 13:00.011
On this decorative end table?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.381
Hey, sue, what's,
uh, what's going on?

13:03.383 --> 13:05.216
I have become a personal slave

13:05.218 --> 13:07.886
Of one myron muskovitz.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.556
<i>We start the day with a series</i>
<i>of vitamin b drips.</i>

13:11.558 --> 13:14.425
<i>And the eight-hour</i>
<i>pitch session begins.</i>

13:14.427 --> 13:16.427
Okay, well, then...

13:16.429 --> 13:19.564
How about a hawaiian-themed
bar mitzvah, huh?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.332
These ideas are terrible!

13:21.334 --> 13:23.234
They're tired!
They're not fresh!

13:23.236 --> 13:24.102
They're not new!

13:24.104 --> 13:25.670
The theme should be me!

13:25.672 --> 13:27.505
I am the theme!
And i want to make

13:27.507 --> 13:29.407
My big reveal by coming down
out of the rafters

13:29.409 --> 13:31.910
In a giant fabergé pod!

13:31.912 --> 13:35.346
Now, janet, can you
get me my espresso?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.749
He says "my espresso"
as if every bean

13:37.751 --> 13:40.185
Was cultivated
specifically for him.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.420
(singing in hebrew)
<i>every night is spent</i>

13:42.422 --> 13:45.123
<i>Reading the torah aloud</i>
<i>while myron sleeps,</i>

13:45.125 --> 13:48.092
<i>So he can absorb the bit he has</i>
<i>to read at his bar mitzvah</i>

13:48.094 --> 13:51.963
<i>Without having</i>
<i>to memorize it himself.</i>

13:51.965 --> 13:53.598
(chair creaks)

13:53.600 --> 13:57.101
I said read the torah!

13:57.103 --> 13:58.136
Sue, this kid is a nightmare.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.304
This has to stop.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.805
Oh, it will... Once you,

14:00.807 --> 14:02.874
Johnny want-a-peen,
homeless, rachel,

14:02.876 --> 14:05.810
The glee club and i
agree to become

14:05.812 --> 14:07.445
His backup dancers

14:07.447 --> 14:09.214
At his bar mitzvah.
Wait, what?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.215
Wait, he wants us?

14:10.217 --> 14:11.950
Yes, we are his last resort.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.518
He blew his entire
entertainment budget

14:13.520 --> 14:15.787
On airfare for a callback
of 100 dancers

14:15.789 --> 14:17.322
In which there was no dancing.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.790
He just called them in
one at a time and said,

14:18.792 --> 14:20.491
"are your allergies
as bad as mine today?"

14:20.493 --> 14:24.162
Now, hold on! I could see
if this kid wanted rachel, will

14:24.164 --> 14:26.064
And even sam, but me?!

14:26.066 --> 14:27.665
Come on, i can't even dance!

14:27.667 --> 14:30.902
My knees have been shot
since my bull-riding days.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.737
Well, i am being forced
to participate,

14:32.739 --> 14:35.006
So i am forcing you
to participate.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.643
So there's at least one person
who's a worse dancer than i am.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.046
I'm in.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.849
(school bell rings)
hey, jane!

14:44.851 --> 14:46.050
What?
Hey, sorry.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.185
Hey, man!
Sorry!

14:47.187 --> 14:49.053
Excuse me, hey! Hey!
Watch it!

14:49.055 --> 14:51.522
Hey, you know, i was thinking,
you know, we should probably

14:51.524 --> 14:53.191
Do this bar mitzvah duet
together.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.592
Oh, um, we would kill it,

14:54.594 --> 14:55.860
But i'm already paired
with roderick.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.161
Well, is roderick taking you out

14:57.163 --> 14:58.997
For pizza after rehearsal?

14:58.999 --> 15:01.499
Oh, is pizza part of
madison's deal-a-meal plan?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.601
Well, i won't tell if you won't.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.503
I'm kind of a badass.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.840
The only badass i know
that's also a male cheerleader.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.508
Well, you know what they say
about cheerleaders.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.576
What?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.244
Um...

15:13.246 --> 15:15.513
Uh, good-good things mostly.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.916
(laughs)
um, listen, uh, if you let

15:17.918 --> 15:19.918
Everyone know that we're
switching partners,

15:19.920 --> 15:22.086
Then i am... All yours.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.856
Cool?

15:24.858 --> 15:26.257
Cool.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.458
Okay.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.526
C-cool.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.929
Bye.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.699
All right, focus,
buddy, you got this.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.034
Come on, focus.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.201
Get up there.

15:37.203 --> 15:40.204
Come on, get up there. Yeah.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.706
Yeah, use your feet
to support you!

15:41.708 --> 15:44.208
Come on! Don't stop, roderick!

15:44.210 --> 15:46.110
You're not even trying!
Come on!

15:46.112 --> 15:48.780
Let's go!
Stop being such a wuss!

15:48.782 --> 15:51.382
That was pathetic.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.551
You have the athleticism
of a couch cushion.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.887
Okay, you know, none of your

15:55.889 --> 15:58.656
Tough love, drill sergeant
crap is helping me at all.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.658
Don't be so sensitive.
"sensitive"?

16:00.660 --> 16:03.061
I-i've been taunted
and teased about

16:03.063 --> 16:04.896
This kind of thing
my entire life.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.098
Not to mention i'm
terrified of heights.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.900
Sometimes this stuff is ugly.

16:08.902 --> 16:10.735
When the guys
on the football team

16:10.737 --> 16:13.237
Work out, it gets messy
and it hurts!

16:13.239 --> 16:14.906
I'm not on the football team!

16:14.908 --> 16:16.741
You know what?
You are absolutely right!

16:16.743 --> 16:19.143
Because you're too fat
and you're too lazy!

16:19.145 --> 16:20.311
You know, this is
why my friend

16:20.313 --> 16:21.412
Doesn't want to go out with you.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.747
No one wants to get close to you

16:22.749 --> 16:24.148
Because you're a dick!

16:27.253 --> 16:28.586
Where do you think
you're going?!

16:28.588 --> 16:30.254
Hey, i held up my end
of the bargain!

16:30.256 --> 16:31.456
You better hold up yours!

16:31.458 --> 16:33.524
Are you okay?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.162
Mason:
Hey, hey!

16:38.164 --> 16:40.131
Roderick, hey, hey! Change of
plans! Um, you're gonna sing

16:40.133 --> 16:41.933
A duet with my sister,
and i'm gonna sing with jane.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.267
Awesome! Thank you.
I don't want to do that.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.836
I don't want to do...
Hey.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.138
Hey, no cutting!
Oh, no, it's okay. We're twins.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.940
What...?!
What's up, buttercup?

16:48.942 --> 16:50.441
Nothing, nothing. Same old,
same old, uh, except,

16:50.443 --> 16:52.143
The bar mitzvah thing?
You're gonna sing

16:52.145 --> 16:53.444
With roderick and i'm
gonna sing with jane.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.779
Oh, why?
You already did that

16:54.781 --> 16:56.347
With her during jagged
little tapestry week.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.782
I know, but i-i want
to do it again.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.350
Um, no, you don't.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.452
Trust me. One-- she has
beautiful legs so no one

17:01.454 --> 17:02.854
Will be looking at yours,
and two--

17:02.856 --> 17:04.155
She has that huge hair
that she loves

17:04.157 --> 17:06.057
To toss around
and upstage everybody with.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.125
That's insane! Look.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.559
I just want to sing with her.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.395
And-and, uh, maybe go
on a date with her.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.296
Mm, mm-mm. No.
Massive mistake, mason.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.965
I won't allow it.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.834
This isn't your decision
to make, madison.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.237
For once in your life, quit
being so darn controlling!

17:19.239 --> 17:22.673
Fine! See what i care!

17:22.675 --> 17:24.308
I certainly don't want
to be controlling!

17:24.310 --> 17:26.310
And while you're at it,
why don't you

17:26.312 --> 17:27.879
Just never listen to me again!

17:27.881 --> 17:30.248
Like that time
i told you not to eat

17:30.250 --> 17:31.916
An entire bag
of sugar-free gummy bears,

17:31.918 --> 17:33.351
And you had diarrhea
and everyone

17:33.353 --> 17:35.386
Thought it was a mud slide!

17:37.057 --> 17:38.022
Madison, come on!

17:38.024 --> 17:39.590
Hey.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.859
Um, i think it'd be easier
for everyone

17:41.861 --> 17:44.028
If i just sang with roderick.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.496
God, you people
are annoying!

17:45.498 --> 17:46.764
Stop cutting!

17:48.501 --> 17:50.468
(school bell ringing)

17:59.779 --> 18:03.114
(the cure's "friday i'm in love"
begins)

18:08.288 --> 18:11.889
¶ i don't care
if monday's blue ¶

18:11.891 --> 18:15.026
¶ tuesday's gray

18:15.028 --> 18:18.229

18:46.993 --> 18:49.560
¶ dressed up to the eyes ¶

18:49.562 --> 18:51.496
¶ it's a wonderful surprise ¶

18:51.498 --> 18:54.832
¶ to see your shoes
and your spirits rise ¶

18:54.834 --> 18:56.567
¶ throwing out your frown ¶

18:56.569 --> 18:59.270
¶ just smiling at the sound
as sleek ¶

18:59.272 --> 19:01.739
¶ as a sheik spinning
round and round ¶

19:01.741 --> 19:03.774
¶ always take a big bite ¶

19:03.776 --> 19:05.443
¶ it's such a gorgeous sight ¶

19:05.445 --> 19:08.646
¶ to see you eat in the middle
of the night ¶

19:08.648 --> 19:10.414
¶ you can never get enough ¶

19:10.416 --> 19:12.517
¶ enough of this stuff ¶

19:12.519 --> 19:15.353
¶ it's friday, i'm in love ¶

19:56.362 --> 19:57.962
(all whooping, cheering)
¶ hey. ¶

19:59.532 --> 20:01.365
Spencer, that was amazing.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.334
And a love song-- not what
we would expect from you.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.535
That was a great song,
definitely,

20:04.537 --> 20:05.736
Yeah.
But probably not what we're

20:05.738 --> 20:07.004
Looking to do
at the bar mitzvah.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.306
I'd love to see
a new combination, though.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.575
Maybe something with
you and jane in there.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.043
Maybe roderick.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.513
Look, fine, i don't care

20:15.515 --> 20:17.515
If you want to throw
other people in the mix

20:17.517 --> 20:19.217
Or pick another song,
but i don't think

20:19.219 --> 20:21.552
I should have to sing
with a quitter like roderick.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.255
I'm not a quitter.
Could've fooled me.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.724
Guys, guys, the point of this
is to band together as a team.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.426
Well, then you might want
to find some people who actually

20:28.428 --> 20:30.094
Want to try to be team players.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.430
Yeah, and maybe you could
try not being a dick.

20:38.171 --> 20:41.205
Man:
Give a warm bar mitzvah welcome
to our little big man

20:41.207 --> 20:44.675
Mr. Myron muskovitz!

20:44.677 --> 20:46.611
(crowd cheering)
myron: Hello, everyone.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.282
Myron!
(whoops)

20:51.284 --> 20:53.618
Now, we've got a great slate
of entertainers.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.919
I promise you the headliner

20:54.921 --> 20:56.687
Is really gonna
knock your socks off.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.256
There's also gonna be
a lot of boring speeches

20:58.258 --> 21:00.925
From my relatives,
so be prepared.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.094
But we've got an amazing group

21:03.096 --> 21:05.062
Who's gonna kick
the night off right.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.231
The stars of mckinley high--

21:07.233 --> 21:09.467
Rachel berry
and the new directions!

21:09.469 --> 21:11.302
And now let's hear it for

21:11.304 --> 21:13.104
Mason mccarthy!

21:13.106 --> 21:15.106
(crowd cheering, whooping)

21:15.108 --> 21:17.208
(queen's "i want to break free"
begins)

21:21.447 --> 21:23.814
¶ i want to break free ¶

21:23.816 --> 21:25.983

21:25.985 --> 21:28.653
¶ i want to break free ¶

21:29.822 --> 21:31.756
¶ i want to break free ¶

21:31.758 --> 21:34.292
¶ from your lies,
you're so self-satisfied ¶

21:34.294 --> 21:37.762
¶ i don't need you ¶

21:37.764 --> 21:40.231
¶ i've got to break free ¶

21:42.669 --> 21:44.168
¶ god knows ¶

21:44.170 --> 21:48.339
¶ god knows i want
to break free ¶

21:49.676 --> 21:54.178
¶ i've fallen in love ¶

21:54.180 --> 21:57.181
¶ i've fallen
in love for the first time ¶

21:57.183 --> 22:01.185
¶ and this time i know
it's for real ¶

22:01.187 --> 22:04.155
¶ i've fallen in love ¶

22:05.024 --> 22:06.924
¶ yeah ¶

22:06.926 --> 22:09.360
¶ god knows ¶

22:09.362 --> 22:12.763
¶ god knows
i've fallen in love ¶

22:15.368 --> 22:18.369
¶ it's strange, but it's true ¶

22:18.371 --> 22:20.204
¶ yeah ¶

22:20.206 --> 22:22.873
¶ i can't get over the way
you love me like you do ¶

22:22.875 --> 22:25.042
¶ but i have to be sure ¶

22:25.044 --> 22:27.378
¶ when i walk out that door ¶

22:27.380 --> 22:31.282
¶ oh, how i want
to be free, baby ¶

22:31.284 --> 22:35.386
¶ oh, how i want to be free ¶

22:35.388 --> 22:40.391
¶ oh, how i want to break free ¶

22:40.393 --> 22:42.727
¶ but life still goes on ¶

22:44.630 --> 22:46.630
¶ i can't get used
to living without ¶

22:46.632 --> 22:48.999
¶ living without,
living without you ¶

22:49.001 --> 22:52.236
¶ by my side ¶

22:52.238 --> 22:55.139
¶ i don't want to live alone ¶

22:55.141 --> 22:57.174
¶ hey ¶

22:57.176 --> 22:59.844
¶ god knows ¶

22:59.846 --> 23:03.114
¶ got to make it on my own ¶

23:04.717 --> 23:08.552
¶ so, baby, can't you see ¶

23:08.554 --> 23:11.989
¶ i've got to break free ¶

23:11.991 --> 23:15.092
¶ i've got
to break free ¶

23:16.562 --> 23:20.030
¶ i want to break free ¶

23:20.032 --> 23:22.500
¶ yeah ¶

23:22.502 --> 23:24.502
¶ i want, i want, i want ¶

23:24.504 --> 23:28.005
¶ i want to break ¶

23:28.007 --> 23:30.441
¶ free. ¶

23:37.216 --> 23:38.849
(laughing):
Are you serious?

23:38.851 --> 23:40.050
Oh, my god.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.787
That was
ridiculously good.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.693
Look, i already know
what you're gonna say.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.430
No, you don't.

23:52.432 --> 23:56.434
Look, mason, your performance
up there was really moving.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.436
And it reminded me
how gifted you are

23:58.438 --> 23:59.737
And how crazy
i've become.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.272
You're not crazy.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.473
(scoffs)

24:02.475 --> 24:04.375
Okay, a little nutty.

24:04.377 --> 24:06.610
Look, i'm not gonna lie--
i was terrified and jealous

24:06.612 --> 24:08.612
When i found out you
had an interest in jane

24:08.614 --> 24:10.614
Because i couldn't
stand the fact

24:10.616 --> 24:12.716
That i wasn't the only
lady in your life anymore.

24:12.718 --> 24:16.220
But the truth is i'm
actually kind of relieved.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.156
You don't need me
anymore, and...

24:19.158 --> 24:20.825
Though maybe you
never really did.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.827
I'll always need you,
madison.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.296
I just need a little bit
more room for some other people

24:25.298 --> 24:27.164
So you're not
the only person in my life.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.167
I'm just so used to
taking care of you.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.802
And looking after you.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.504
And it's not really
because i wanted to,

24:33.506 --> 24:35.506
But because i-i
felt like i had to.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.843
You know i'm a better person
because of you.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.845
Yeah.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.980
Well, i'm a better
person because of you.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.421
Okay.

24:50.423 --> 24:53.424
Okay, but i'm just gonna say
it-- jane is a total stage hog.

24:53.426 --> 24:54.592
Madison.
Well, she is.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.893
Come on.
She is.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.768
Myron: Oh, my god! Help me!
Somebody help me!

25:04.770 --> 25:07.037
Help, sue, help me!
Will: Sue, what's wrong?

25:07.039 --> 25:09.340
Ugh, myron's hair and makeup
were in peak condition,

25:09.342 --> 25:11.775
So he got into his
stage pod early.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.644
Rachel:
Wait, is he trapped in there?
Sue: Yes.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.646
Sue, get me out of here!

25:15.648 --> 25:17.781
I go on in five minutes!

25:17.783 --> 25:19.950
The rope's stuck in
that pulley-- it's not budging.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.219
Okay, postmodern gay,
use those shapely thighs

25:22.221 --> 25:24.522
To wiggle up this rope
and get that thing down.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.224
Forget it, sue.
Oh, come on, what are
you protesting now?

25:27.226 --> 25:29.293
There's only one man
for the job.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.297
What are you doing?

25:33.299 --> 25:34.999
Look, i know i was
a dick before,

25:35.001 --> 25:36.333
But i was the wrong
kind of dick,

25:36.335 --> 25:38.502
And this time, i'm being
the right kind of dick.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.037
And i'm telling you
that you can do this.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.171
Kitty:
Can't we just get a ladder?

25:41.173 --> 25:42.172
There's got to be one
in here somewhere.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.874
No, roderick
can do it.

25:46.479 --> 25:48.479
Roderick:<i> Okay, roderick,</i>
<i>time to man up.</i>

25:48.481 --> 25:50.748
(heart pounding)

25:50.750 --> 25:52.750
Oh, what the hell?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.652
Give me those gloves.

25:54.654 --> 25:57.254
All (chanting):
Do it, do it, do it,

25:57.256 --> 25:59.823
Do it, do it.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.859
Roderick:
<i>Well, spencer's got my back.</i>

26:01.861 --> 26:03.861
(slow motion):
Do it, do it.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.730
<i>I guess i can do this.</i>

26:06.732 --> 26:10.434
All:
Do it, do it, do it, do it...

26:10.436 --> 26:13.704
(chant fades)

26:13.706 --> 26:15.406
(distorted, indistinct chatter)

26:15.408 --> 26:17.107
You got it.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.108
Come on.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.109
Oh!
Whoa!

26:19.111 --> 26:20.110
Hang in there, man!

26:20.112 --> 26:21.312
Come on, buddy!

26:22.548 --> 26:23.547
Roderick:
<i>All right, roderick,</i>

26:23.549 --> 26:24.648
<i>Do this for the team.</i>

26:26.452 --> 26:28.452
<i>Almost there. Keep going.</i>

26:28.454 --> 26:31.288
<i>Just a little further.</i>

26:31.290 --> 26:33.490
Yeah, all right, buddy,
all right.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.837
You did it.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.306
I can't believe
i did that.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.308
In emergencies,

26:51.310 --> 26:53.043
Even babies
can lift cars.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.614
(panting)

26:56.616 --> 26:58.616
I think i pooped myself.

26:58.618 --> 27:02.152
I think i freakin' pooped
myself, sue. I can't go on.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.989
My future ride, mr. Reinbeck,
is out there waiting for me.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.491
Do you not get
how important this is?!

27:07.493 --> 27:08.926
Kitty, get me a fist full
of butt wipes,

27:08.928 --> 27:11.228
And, uh, how about a soupçon
of gummy bears?

27:11.230 --> 27:12.229
How does that sound?

27:12.231 --> 27:13.664
But i'm supposed to be onstage.

27:13.666 --> 27:14.665
Don't worry, we'll stall them.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.066
Spencer, jane, come on.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.568
And roderick--

27:17.570 --> 27:18.736
(chuckling):
Sure.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.304
Yeah, we're with you.

Five, six, seven, eight.

29:48.888 --> 29:49.987
Step together.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.321
Pivot, pivot

29:51.323 --> 29:52.656
And point.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.057
Sheldon, you nailed it.

29:54.059 --> 29:55.659
Sam, you turned
the wrong way again.

29:55.661 --> 29:57.161
No, i think you guys turned
the wrong way.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.495
Sue, where are you going?

29:58.497 --> 30:00.664
That's it-- i'm done.
Good night.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.666
No, no, hang in there, hang
in there-- you've almost got it.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.001
Hey, as the poet
once said--

30:04.003 --> 30:05.903
"fake it till you make it."

30:05.905 --> 30:08.338
William, in the name
of all that is sacred,

30:08.340 --> 30:10.841
For once in your life,
please, just stop talking.

30:10.843 --> 30:13.343
I don't care about heel
steps or point turns.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.180
Or old-timey sayings found
on grandmas' sweatshirts.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.748
And why are you
even still here?

30:17.750 --> 30:19.483
You don't even work
at this school.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.918
You asked me to help.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.520
Excuse me--
you asked all of us.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.490
Shut up, dreidel. This is
between butt chin and me.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.993
So why are you the pied
piper of lost causes, huh?

30:29.995 --> 30:33.497
And why on earth do these
idiots think so highly of you

30:33.499 --> 30:36.099
When you've done absolutely
nothing for their lives

30:36.101 --> 30:37.534
Except make it worse?

30:37.536 --> 30:40.537
I secured you a dream
job at vocal adrenaline,

30:40.539 --> 30:43.040
One of the best show
choirs in america.

30:43.042 --> 30:46.510
And within minutes,
you screwed that up.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.712
And now you're back,
skulking the hallways

30:48.714 --> 30:51.381
With your aw-shucks,
reach-for-the-stars attitude,

30:51.383 --> 30:53.884
And it will not stand.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.552
Susie q.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.720
May i call you
susie q?

30:56.722 --> 30:58.055
No, you may not.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.857
The superintendent got you
into this, not me.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.291
So why aren't you
going after him?

31:01.293 --> 31:03.327
Oh, that's right.

31:03.329 --> 31:06.330
You still have a little
crush on old bob, don't you?

31:06.332 --> 31:08.632
You're thinking if you play your
cards right, you just might get

31:08.634 --> 31:10.701
A date with a guy
who once mistook you for a man.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.569
Ah, that's really sad,
susie q.

31:12.571 --> 31:13.637
Even for you.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.239
How dare you.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.040
Oh, by the way,

31:17.042 --> 31:18.876
Hope you're enjoying
my axe body spray.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.410
It's a new scent called

31:20.412 --> 31:23.714
"this woman standing next to me
is clearly losing her mind."

31:23.716 --> 31:27.084
We should just head back over
this way; maybe a zantac...

31:27.086 --> 31:29.186
All right, let's, uh,
let's go from the top, guys.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.255
(roars)

31:33.259 --> 31:35.492
(sue screams)

31:36.428 --> 31:38.862
Stop it.
You're hurting him.

31:38.864 --> 31:40.898
Is something, uh, wrong?

31:40.900 --> 31:43.600
No, we're just rehearsing.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.102
Ah.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.603
Yeah, well, let's get
to the stage, people.

31:46.605 --> 31:47.671
It's showtime.

31:47.673 --> 31:48.672
Yeah!

31:48.674 --> 31:49.740
(thuds)

31:54.213 --> 31:56.046
Spencer: What are you
doing in here?

31:56.048 --> 31:58.615
Playing a ukulele.

31:58.617 --> 32:02.419
I like to jam out on my uke
sometimes to the classics.

32:02.421 --> 32:06.390
So you just happened to be
in here hoping that i'd walk by.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.558
No, roderick told me
about the bar mitzvah.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.960
Mmm.
He said that you'd
be performing,

32:09.962 --> 32:11.795
And that i wouldn't
want to miss it.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.231
And, man, was
he right.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.733
Oh, wait, you were
in there watching?

32:16.735 --> 32:18.635
Oh, yes. Yes, i was.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.972
You got some moves,
varsity blues.

32:21.974 --> 32:24.808
But actually i wanted a chance
to say sorry for ignoring you.

32:24.810 --> 32:28.312
Maybe i didn't get the best
first impression of you.

32:28.314 --> 32:31.315
Roderick told me about
how you stood up for him.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.317
How you always
had his back.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.485
And, well, that was really
cool of you, spencer.

32:35.487 --> 32:40.324
I got a feeling that underneath
all that macho snark,

32:40.326 --> 32:42.759
You're a pretty sweet
guy on the inside.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.429
Plus, on the outside,
you're smoking hot.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.264
I mean, like,
i'm not blind.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.499
You're, like,
ridiculously hot.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.169
You know, we still need
people for the glee club

32:52.171 --> 32:53.303
If you're interested.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.005
In the glee club?
Mm-hmm.

32:55.007 --> 32:57.007
Uh, i don't know.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.675
I mean, i might be
kind of a loser,

32:58.677 --> 33:00.177
But am i really that
much of a loser?

33:00.179 --> 33:02.579
I'm gonna say yes.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.614
Well, you're gonna have to
work on that sales pitch

33:04.616 --> 33:05.749
If you really...

33:13.292 --> 33:14.691
And sold.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.860
(chuckles)

33:16.862 --> 33:18.462
Places, people!

33:18.464 --> 33:21.131
Well, according to
my doomsday watch,

33:21.133 --> 33:23.700
It's preciously one
minute before midnight.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.703
The final chapter
of world war glee.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.439
And it all begins
when i trip you onstage.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.807
You're gonna fall on your butt

33:30.809 --> 33:32.876
In front of a bunch
of 13-year-olds.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.711
You wouldn't dare.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.546
Wouldn't i?

35:35.234 --> 35:37.667
¶ this is the part ¶

35:37.669 --> 35:39.970
¶ when i say
i don't want you ¶

35:39.972 --> 35:42.672
¶ i'm stronger
than i been before ¶

35:42.674 --> 35:45.175
¶ this is the part ¶

35:45.177 --> 35:47.410
¶ when i break free ¶

35:47.412 --> 35:50.247
¶ 'cause i can't resist it
no more. ¶

35:50.249 --> 35:52.082
(song ends, applause)

36:07.032 --> 36:08.765
(school bell ringing)
hey, man, do you, uh,

36:08.767 --> 36:10.467
Know of any protein supplements
that you like?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.102
You know what, buddy,
skip the supplements

36:12.104 --> 36:13.370
And eat some
organic chicken instead.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.172
You'll thank me for it.

36:15.174 --> 36:18.041
Oh, well, actually, i already
owe you a debt of gratitude.

36:18.043 --> 36:20.544
I've, uh, started working out
and eating better.

36:20.546 --> 36:24.214
I still sneak a few cheetos
before bed sometimes,

36:24.216 --> 36:26.116
But i actually feel
really great.

36:26.118 --> 36:28.451
And you had my back
and you challenged me

36:28.453 --> 36:30.854
To make some important changes,
so thank you.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.556
That's awesome, buddy.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.723
Glad i could help.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.458
Uh, sorry,
but i got to run.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.160
Oh, yeah.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.062
I heard you're hanging out
with a certain someone.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.164
Yeah, alistair and i
are finally going out.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.200
He's amazing.

36:43.202 --> 36:46.002
He's the first guy i've ever met
who actually makes me nervous.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.971
(sighs)
i really like him.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.539
I hope i don't screw it up.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.274
Yeah, i hope you don't, either.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.577
Rachel: Let me
help you with these.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.078
Organize a little bit.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.647
Oh, myron, hi!
Are you here to thank us

36:57.649 --> 36:58.915
For throwing you the
greatest bar mitzvah

36:58.917 --> 37:00.016
In the entire world?

37:00.018 --> 37:01.251
Because a note would've
been sufficient.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.352
Um, these words

37:02.354 --> 37:03.687
Are like poison on my tongue.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.189
Myron muskovitz is
the newest student

37:06.191 --> 37:07.757
Here at mckinley high,

37:07.759 --> 37:10.060
And he would like to join
the glee club.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.595
You're not my mother!

37:11.597 --> 37:12.896
You don't have to speak for me!

37:12.898 --> 37:14.097
Now get me my inhaler!

37:16.702 --> 37:17.901
(gasps)

37:17.903 --> 37:19.102
Ow!

37:19.104 --> 37:20.704
Hey, come back here!

37:20.706 --> 37:22.038
Don't touch the piano!

37:22.040 --> 37:24.107
(piano playing erratically)

37:24.109 --> 37:25.942
Wait, sue, how-how is this
even possible?

37:25.944 --> 37:27.377
Myron's 13 years old.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.279
Well, that's a very valid point,
william,

37:29.281 --> 37:32.249
And it's one i made
rather convincingly, i thought,

37:32.251 --> 37:35.218
And, uh, superintendent harris
chose to ignore it.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.954
Instead, he strong-armed myron's
middle school principal

37:37.956 --> 37:39.389
Into submitting a petition

37:39.391 --> 37:41.758
To the school board
stating that myron

37:41.760 --> 37:43.460
Is so prodigiously talented

37:43.462 --> 37:45.962
That the junior
high environment

37:45.964 --> 37:48.231
Was no longer suited to him.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.267
Wait, so what you're saying
is that the glee club just got

37:50.269 --> 37:52.068
A brand-new, highly talented
singer and dancer

37:52.070 --> 37:54.137
Who happens to be a member
of the superintendent's family?

37:54.139 --> 37:56.306
Wow, sue, that has got to burn.

37:56.308 --> 37:59.943
It is my dunkirk, william.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.411
(groaning)

38:01.413 --> 38:03.313
But it is just the first battle

38:03.315 --> 38:05.815
Of the great war
to end all wars.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.717
Hmn.
And in the words

38:07.719 --> 38:09.252
Of a former
vice presidential candidate

38:09.254 --> 38:11.988
And my personal lamaze coach,

38:11.990 --> 38:13.556
"i do not retreat."

38:16.895 --> 38:18.895
"i reload."

38:18.897 --> 38:20.897
You gonna jump at me again, sue?

38:20.899 --> 38:23.333
I just might.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.068
And then again, i might not.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.573
Sue:
<i>I had a plan.</i>

38:30.575 --> 38:32.409
<i>Make this school the best</i>
<i>in the state,</i>

38:32.411 --> 38:33.910
<i>Cement my reputation</i>

38:33.912 --> 38:35.612
<i>As the greatest educator</i>
<i>since mao,</i>

38:35.614 --> 38:37.180
<i>And then ride off</i>
<i>into the sunset</i>

38:37.182 --> 38:38.581
<i>On the back of one of the five</i>

38:38.583 --> 38:40.583
<i>Remaining black rhinos</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

38:40.585 --> 38:43.586
<i>Instead, well, i find myself</i>
<i>right back where i began,</i>

38:43.588 --> 38:45.689
<i>With a singular,</i>
<i>unwavering mission.</i>

38:45.691 --> 38:47.524
<i>I thought i had decapitated</i>

38:47.526 --> 38:50.593
<i>That glee club,</i>
<i>lanced it like a genital wart,</i>

38:50.595 --> 38:54.531
<i>But it has emerged once again</i>
<i>from its feculent roots.</i>

38:58.103 --> 39:00.470
<i>And so here we are.</i>

39:00.472 --> 39:03.540
<i>I will spend the last few weeks</i>
<i>of my professional life</i>

39:03.542 --> 39:06.810
<i>Fulfilling what i now know</i>
<i>is my destiny.</i>

39:06.812 --> 39:09.379
<i>This may kill me in the end.</i>
<i>I may not survive</i>

39:09.381 --> 39:12.048
<i>One last charge</i>
<i>unto the breach,</i>

39:12.050 --> 39:13.850
<i>Dear friends,</i>
<i>but i swear to you,</i>

39:13.852 --> 39:15.285
<i>Oh, pretend people</i>

39:15.287 --> 39:16.886
<i>That i'm speaking to in my head</i>

39:16.888 --> 39:18.221
<i>And are very impressed with me,</i>

39:18.223 --> 39:20.790
<i>I will be</i>
<i>the last man standing.</i>

39:20.792 --> 39:23.126
<i>As the great khan once said</i>

39:23.128 --> 39:25.395
<i>To captain james t. Kirk,</i>

39:25.397 --> 39:28.732
<i>"from hell's heart</i>
<i>i stab at thee, william."</i>

39:28.734 --> 39:32.469
<i>They can bury me in this</i>
<i>hurt locker if they want to,</i>

39:32.471 --> 39:34.838
<i>But you</i>
<i>and your entire glee club</i>

39:34.840 --> 39:38.541
<i>Are going to be buried in here</i>
<i>with me.</i>

39:38.543 --> 39:39.976
Junior high's small potatoes.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.478
I can see that now.

39:44.383 --> 39:47.250
But i'll never forget
you lending me your panties

39:47.252 --> 39:48.985
After i soiled myself
in that pod.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.420
Here.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.355
You deserve it.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.491
I don't even care if this is
some weird blood diamond money.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.658
I do deserve it.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.093
Stick with me, sweetheart,

39:57.095 --> 39:58.828
And i'll make sure
you never go hungry.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.563
How about a little sugar?

40:00.565 --> 40:04.501
Uh, that's a hard no on the
kiss, but keep the cash coming,

40:04.503 --> 40:06.069
And you'll always have a friend
in glee club,

40:06.071 --> 40:07.237
And trust me, kid,

40:07.239 --> 40:09.172
You're gonna need one.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.610
The new directions' luck
has officially changed.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.944
I can feel it.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.446
Now with alistair

40:16.448 --> 40:18.348
And myron in the club,
we have eight members,

40:18.350 --> 40:19.983
Which means we're more
than halfway there.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.686
Every year, there's gonna be
new kids in there.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.455
Some kids that will disappear,

40:25.457 --> 40:27.690
Some kids that touch your life
more than others.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.794
You just have to do your best,
hope to make a difference.

40:30.796 --> 40:33.062
Well, you made
a difference with me.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.798
And you with me.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.733
No, i-i'm serious, rachel.

40:36.735 --> 40:39.269
Sometimes i can't help
but look at you

40:39.271 --> 40:41.805
The way i did
when i first met you, but...

40:41.807 --> 40:44.240
You've evolved into
a very intelligent young woman.

40:44.242 --> 40:47.143
And i am so excited
to be coworkers with you.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.778
Nothing makes me happier.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.815
Me, too.

40:53.552 --> 40:54.951
All right, let's go to work.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.353
(echosmith's "cool kids" begins)

41:00.892 --> 41:04.994
¶ she sees them walking
in a straight line ¶

41:04.996 --> 41:06.996
¶ that's not really her style ¶

41:06.998 --> 41:08.965
(chuckles)

41:08.967 --> 41:11.801
¶ and they all got
the same heartbeat ¶

41:11.803 --> 41:14.537
¶ but hers is falling behind ¶

41:17.008 --> 41:18.741
¶ nothing in this world could ¶

41:18.743 --> 41:21.644
¶ ever bring them down ¶

41:24.583 --> 41:26.516
¶ yeah, they're invincible ¶

41:26.518 --> 41:29.085
¶ and she's just
in the background ¶

41:30.689 --> 41:32.655
¶ and she says ¶

41:32.657 --> 41:35.859
¶ i wish that i could be
like the cool kids ¶

41:35.861 --> 41:37.760
¶ 'cause all the cool kids ¶

41:37.762 --> 41:39.662

41:43.435 --> 41:46.102
¶ like the cools kids ¶

41:53.678 --> 41:56.212
¶ he sees them talking
with a big smile ¶

41:56.214 --> 41:58.681
¶ but they haven't got a clue ¶

41:58.683 --> 42:00.884
(chuckles)

42:00.886 --> 42:03.653
¶ yet they're living
the good life ¶

42:03.655 --> 42:06.222
¶ can't see what he
is going through ¶

42:08.126 --> 42:11.160
¶ they're driving fast cars ¶

42:11.162 --> 42:13.963
¶ but they don't know
where they're going ¶

42:16.034 --> 42:18.535
¶ in the fast lane ¶

42:18.537 --> 42:22.405
¶ living life without knowing ¶

42:22.407 --> 42:23.973
¶ and he says ¶

42:23.975 --> 42:27.977
¶ i wish that i could be like
the cool kids ¶

42:27.979 --> 42:31.314
