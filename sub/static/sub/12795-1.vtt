01:16.920 --> 01:19.220
From 9:20 to 11:30,
you have your meetings with

01:19.320 --> 01:21.380
Mr. Haldeman,
Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Zeigler.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.020
From 11:40 to 12:05,
you have a meeting in the Grand Hall

01:24.120 --> 01:25.540
to receive diplomatic credentials

01:25.640 --> 01:28.450
from the Ambassadors of the
Dominican Republic and Zambia.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.644
Do they speak any English?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.020
- I believe so.
- Oh, good.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.820
Because I hate it when they don't even try.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.700
You know,
whenever I go to a foreign country

01:37.800 --> 01:39.340
I always try to learn some phrases.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.180
You know, it gives me an edge
with the people of that country.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.328
You know, shows I did my homework,
shows I care.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.460
Some people come right in here, no effort.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.721
No effort whatsoever.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.220
Not in their national character.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.322
That's why they'll never be
superpowers like us.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.300
From 12:05 to 1:05,
you have your open hour,

02:00.400 --> 02:01.900
at the end of which
we thought would be a good time

02:02.000 --> 02:03.660
to have your meeting with Mr. Presley.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.940
From 1:10 to 1:30,
you have an informal meet-and-greet

02:06.040 --> 02:08.139
with 150 or so White House volunteers
in the State...

02:08.240 --> 02:10.640
Elvis? Elvis Presley?

02:11.440 --> 02:12.805
Yes, sir. The entertainer.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.486
I know who Elvis Presley is. Yes.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.927
Who the fuck set this up?

03:56.080 --> 03:58.481
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here!
This is the War Room.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.780
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation!

04:01.880 --> 04:05.282
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.887
In America, black people

04:12.520 --> 04:14.180
are treated very much as

04:14.280 --> 04:17.045
the Vietnamese people
or any other colonized people...

04:17.600 --> 04:19.339
President Nixon and his press secretary

04:19.440 --> 04:20.579
made no comment about...

04:20.680 --> 04:22.780
...kids are saying.
Smoke pot with your kids

04:22.880 --> 04:25.087
and then you'll understand
why the kids are happy.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.900
You gotta be kidding me.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.482
...and in Cambodia,
the fight against suspected communists.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.700
One, two, three, four,

04:34.800 --> 04:36.962
stop the war against the poor!

05:00.640 --> 05:01.641
Next, please.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.730
Hello, ma'am. One ticket, please.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.330
And where will you be traveling to, sir?

05:11.640 --> 05:12.880
Los Angeles.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.849
The one in California?

05:15.760 --> 05:17.000
That's the one.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.605
"The one in California?"
What other one is there?

05:22.040 --> 05:24.486
You know, I prayed
this day would come so many times.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.780
My cousin,
she would always tell me, "Margaret,

05:28.880 --> 05:30.780
"you are never,
ever going to meet the King.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.900
"So just get over it."

05:33.000 --> 05:35.048
You gotta hold on to your dreams.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.091
You have beautiful eyes.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.046
So, about the ticket?

05:40.680 --> 05:42.603
Of course.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.980
We have a flight leaving
in less than an hour.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.447
- I'll take it.
- Yes. Of course.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.603
I'm so sorry to have to ask,

05:51.880 --> 05:54.180
but, do you have
any form of identification?

05:54.280 --> 05:55.406
Yes, ma'am.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.722
Not like a driver's license or something?

06:02.880 --> 06:04.689
Confidentially speaking,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.900
this is the first time
I've ever flown on my own.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.411
- So, I...
- It's fine.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.660
Excuse me, sir... Is that a...

06:15.760 --> 06:17.603
Oh, this? This is my .45.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.020
Yeah, I got a little pistol
in my boot, too.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.248
I got permits for both of them, so...

06:36.640 --> 06:39.140
They need these catalogued and vaulted.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.244
And there's a call for you.
He says his name is Mr. Tiger.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.646
- Elvis?
- Mr. Cougar?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.160
I'm in a bit of a pickle here.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.580
I was just trying to hop a quick flight
on American Airlines

07:01.680 --> 07:04.160
and now I'm being detained
due to carrying side arms.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.207
- You took guns on a plane?
- Yeah.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.060
Elvis, why are you flying commercial?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.740
Top secret. Gotta bolt quick, Jerry.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.524
You know, click-bang.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.820
I'll explain it to you
when you pick me up at the airport.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.922
- Yeah. I'm at work.
- Come on, Jerry

07:18.040 --> 07:20.088
You're the only one I can trust with this.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.531
Okay.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.405
- I'll pick you up.
- Good.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.940
Now... About my little situation here...

07:30.040 --> 07:31.326
Yeah, I got an idea.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.081
The guy in front of you,
ask if he has any kids.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.900
Come on, honey. It's all right.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.100
That's a pretty coat you got there.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.725
Y'all scrunch on in now.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.885
Great big old smile!

07:43.280 --> 07:44.580
That looked good.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.780
- Thank you so much, Mr. Presley.
- Thank you.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.300
Anything for law enforcement.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.731
Oh, yes, sir.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.611
Look at this handsome devil.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.766
Hey.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.820
I knew I could count on you, Mr. Cougar.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.604
How are you, Mr. Tiger?

08:12.320 --> 08:13.606
This is my man.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.300
And I promised these young ladies

08:16.400 --> 08:17.820
we'd give them a ride home.
You don't mind, do you?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.160
No.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.042
I like the way you walk

08:25.760 --> 08:27.922
I like the way you talk

08:29.560 --> 08:33.405
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk

08:33.880 --> 08:35.644
Suzie Q

08:53.440 --> 08:55.204
Hey, that's a great book, man.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.131
You should check it out.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.164
You're a number six.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.844
I miss our talks, Jerry.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.726
Me too, E.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.402
I came out here to get you, man.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.940
I got work.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.849
How much are they paying you at Paramount?

09:17.480 --> 09:19.420
You don't even want to
say it out loud, do you...

09:19.520 --> 09:20.700
I actually just got a promotion.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.060
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.844
Well, how's this for a promotion?

09:24.520 --> 09:27.100
Let's stop screwing around
and start up that studio, man.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.220
I'm ready.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.300
I'll put you right beside me,
you can run whatever you want.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.380
Editing, production...

09:31.480 --> 09:33.767
You know I'm trying to do
my own thing here.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.844
It's no problem,
I can get you on a jet back from D.C.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.730
- D.C.?
- Yeah.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.362
See, here's the real deal, Jerry.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.250
I want to get a badge.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.725
A federal badge.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.780
You know, like that clown
we met at Chasen's that one night.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.769
The guy who does the voice of Bullwinkle.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.842
If a guy like that can have a badge,
why can't I?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.970
Does Priscilla know about this?

10:04.080 --> 10:06.060
- No.
- What about your daddy?

10:06.160 --> 10:08.700
Heck, no, man. They're all screaming at me.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.406
Calling the Colonel,
saying I'm spending too much cash.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.780
I just did 29 days at the International.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.100
I sold out every night in Vegas.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.884
I got plenty of dough.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.326
You don't tell a grown man
how to spend his money.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.805
It ain't right.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.850
Come on, panther man.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.603
Take this trip with me. It'll be fun.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.700
Hi, Donald, it's Jerry here.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.131
I'm going to have to call in sick.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.969
Yes. I am so sorry.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.289
Can you connect me
to the Hotel Washington?

10:47.320 --> 10:48.420
Hello, American Airlines?

10:48.520 --> 10:52.206
I was wondering, could I rent
the whole top floor of your hotel tonight?

10:53.160 --> 10:54.764
It's actually for me and a guy named Elvis.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.249
- Was Cilla mad?
- At first. Understandably.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.609
But I handled it.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.525
You always do.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.281
The Colonel?

11:10.880 --> 11:12.405
I told her not to tell him.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.531
Thattaboy. Keep the Fat Man out of this.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.321
And Sonny's gonna meet us there
and take over.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.085
Look at these guys.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.567
You're kidding me, man.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.340
That's good,
but Elvis would never wear that, man.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.580
Oh, really?

11:26.680 --> 11:27.727
Yeah, I'm an Elvis impersonator, too.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.203
- That's frightening.
- You're good though, man.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.442
You could be second best, baby.
You know what I'm saying?

11:32.680 --> 11:33.761
Do you do Teddy Bear?

11:33.960 --> 11:36.180
- When I'm in the mood.
- Well, listen to this, man.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.886
I got an Elvis song
that's gonna blow you away, man.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.220
I'm gonna rock it to the left

11:41.320 --> 11:43.140
I'm gonna rock it to the right

11:43.240 --> 11:44.460
I'm gonna rock it in the middle

11:44.560 --> 11:46.688
And rock it all night

11:46.960 --> 11:51.488
Now that, baby,
that is where the rock-a-hula really is.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.649
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thank you.

12:05.120 --> 12:09.205
Hey, Jerry,
could you proofread this for me?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.491
It's a letter.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.571
Yeah. Sure.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.140
You wrote a letter to Nixon?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.446
Yeah. That's right.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.725
What do you think?

12:24.280 --> 12:26.760
I think it's more than a badge.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.368
I know. But have you seen
the TV lately, Jerry?

12:30.640 --> 12:33.166
War. Crime. Riots.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.820
It's all going downhill, man.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.420
We are at a crossroads.
It's make or break time for this country.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.460
And this country made me, man.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.565
You think there'd be an Elvis Presley
if this land was communist? Heck, no.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.762
That's what's going on in the streets.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.300
And it's the drugs, too.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.050
It's messing with the kids' minds.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.524
What kind of man would I be
if I didn't offer to help?

13:22.280 --> 13:23.520
Can I help you, sir?

13:24.640 --> 13:26.927
I need to get this letter to the President.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.660
There's a mailbox at the corner of...

13:30.760 --> 13:32.091
At the end of the avenue.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.605
Yeah. I got you.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.500
Hey, you think there could be some sort of
special delivery method?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.329
It's a matter of national security.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.411
The mailbox is down the street.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.241
Hey, Pete.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.926
Ah, shit.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.570
Can you come here for a minute, please?

13:49.240 --> 13:50.685
Are they coming to get me?

13:52.240 --> 13:53.700
Excuse me, officer. Is there a problem?

13:53.800 --> 13:54.820
Not at all.

13:54.920 --> 13:55.967
Good morning.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.965
It's Elvis.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.604
Mailbox is around the corner.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.009
You're ex-military. Right?

14:08.520 --> 14:10.761
- Marines.
- Marines, yeah.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.281
Figures.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.260
I was just regular
old Army myself, you know.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.204
Third Armored Battalion.
Trained at Fort Hood.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.205
But we knew the Marines
was where it was at, you know.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.780
Well, it takes a certain kind of grit.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.860
That's it, man. That's it.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.282
I never had it myself,
but I wish that I did.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.005
I'll tell you what.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.940
I'll put it inside for you,

14:38.040 --> 14:40.327
but I can't guarantee
it'll get to the President's office.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.460
Why not?

14:41.560 --> 14:42.561
What's your name?

14:43.280 --> 14:44.406
And who are you, sir?

14:44.560 --> 14:48.007
- Oh, I'm, uh, his head of...
- Personal relations.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.620
- PR, yeah.
- Public relations.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.006
Public relations.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.100
Well, the thing is, Mr. Presley...

14:55.200 --> 14:56.201
Burrows.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.241
I'm undercover.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.529
Mr. Burrows.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.140
We get a lot of mail for the White House.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.300
I'm sure.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.740
And it all has to be cleared through security
before it can reach the President.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.842
Sometimes that can take a few days.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.686
But...

15:16.560 --> 15:19.370
We'll do our best
considering the circumstances, hmm?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.420
Thank you.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.170
It's important to me, you know?

15:24.240 --> 15:27.164
I have a deep respect
for what you gentlemen do.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.569
He's taller than I thought he'd be.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.201
What?

16:40.760 --> 16:41.966
I'm beat.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.447
President's getting raked over the coals
over this Manson trial declaration.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.251
You're never gonna believe this.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.740
You remember when you talked about
finding a friend for the President?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.660
- Someone from the outside.
- Yeah.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.820
Well, you'll never guess in a million years
who just showed up at the Northwest Gate

17:00.920 --> 17:01.967
asking to see him.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.340
Okay. Look, I'm not in the mood
for this. Who?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.851
The King.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.007
The King of what?

17:06.119 --> 17:07.804
The President doesn't have
any appointments with royalty...

17:07.920 --> 17:09.660
Not just any king.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.220
The King.

17:11.319 --> 17:12.320
Elvis.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.859
- Elvis Presley?
- Yes.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.220
At the Northwest Gate? He just walked up.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.099
- Right.
- I'm not kidding. Look.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.044
He delivered this
to the President in person.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.420
"John Burrows."

17:33.520 --> 17:36.126
Yeah. I don't know what that is.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.580
You swear this isn't a joke,
'cause this penmanship is horrible!

17:39.680 --> 17:41.569
On my honor, yes.
It looks like a child wrote it, I know.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.140
He said he wants to be
a "Federal Agent-At-Large."

17:45.240 --> 17:47.720
- Does that even exist?
- Oh, who knows.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.171
We got to set this up.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.324
- Hey, Jer!
- Glad you made it, Sonny.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.644
- How you doing?
- Wow, nice place.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.882
- Come here.
- Ah, man.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.883
- What is that?
- I don't know.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.820
The boss man told me
to bring it up from Graceland.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.700
Said it was top secret.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.723
- Where is he?
- He's taking a nap.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.220
Just like old times.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.900
Glad to have you back.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.260
I'm not back.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.930
You missed it last month.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.571
We took the bikes down to New Orleans,
and put the girls on the back and just rode.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.770
E kept stopping every hour or so

18:31.880 --> 18:35.570
to point out a place he used to play at, or
toss the ball around. You know how he is.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.300
Everybody was on their Bonnevilles,
except I was on my Harley.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.980
And goddamn Charlie Hodge
was on a Kawasaki.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.048
E gave him holy hell about that one.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.500
You still got your Bonneville?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.807
No, I... I had to sell it.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.089
You're in the movie business, right?

18:51.400 --> 18:53.660
Hey, you ever watch The Partridge Family?

18:53.760 --> 18:56.081
Laurie Partridge is such a piece of ass.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.260
Next time I'm in town,
can you set me up with her?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.180
I'm not doing that kind of movie stuff.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.327
I'm doing more of the editing.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.220
Not as glamorous,

19:04.320 --> 19:07.220
but I actually did see Faye Dunaway once.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.460
Really?

19:08.560 --> 19:10.380
- How's Charlotte?
- Yeah, she's good.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.606
She still writing that book?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.180
I mean, that's a hell of a fantastic...

19:13.280 --> 19:14.540
Fuck, I gotta call her.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.927
- Can you keep an eye on him?
- No problemo.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.820
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.380
Where are you?

19:21.480 --> 19:23.820
I can't say right now,
but it's pretty crazy.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.780
Elvis had to take a trip and he needed me.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.900
And so, I had to call Graceland.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.540
They were all freaking out.

19:30.640 --> 19:34.340
Priscilla, Vern.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.460
But I think I handled it. Maybe...

19:36.560 --> 19:38.164
Jerry, you're out of town?

19:38.640 --> 19:39.846
Yeah.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.780
You don't remember, do you?

19:42.880 --> 19:43.860
Remember?

19:43.960 --> 19:45.405
My parents are flying in.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.446
Oh, shit.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.740
- They're gonna love you.
- Dinner.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.968
Yes, I remember. 8:00.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.485
I arrive at LAX at 6:00,
so I should be home by 7:00.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.123
- Do you promise?
- Of course. Why?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.684
I can hear it in your voice, baby.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.205
You're back.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.620
- I'm not back.
- Good.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.260
Then come back home to me.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.850
There's nothing I want more.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.500
I miss you. I miss everything about you.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.780
- You miss me?
- I miss your face.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.804
And I miss that sweet, sweet ass.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.060
Do you miss Elvis more?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.605
Oh, wow..

20:26.800 --> 20:27.801
E?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.460
Hey. Where's E? He's not here.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.561
I fell asleep.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.860
I leave you with one thing, one thing.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.340
We're the only two people
who know where he is.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.220
I fell asleep. E!

20:50.320 --> 20:52.140
Did you look in the dining room?

20:52.240 --> 20:53.605
E!

21:02.920 --> 21:04.780
- This is Ronnie.
- Ronnie, it's Jerry

21:04.880 --> 21:06.291
- Hey, Jer.
- Are you with E?

21:06.520 --> 21:08.540
- Yeah, I got him.
- Thank God for that.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.480
He was hungry so we're heading over
to Stan's Original Donuts.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.405
- Thank you, Ronnie.
- You're welcome, boss.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.365
- Hey.
- Gentlemen.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.820
Kepple Carpet is gonna charge
to just come in there and measure.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.900
They gonna charge him for the appraisal.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.620
They gonna charge him
just to even come out there.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.087
Now I'm getting you... What?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.562
Excuse me. Are you in line?

21:44.280 --> 21:45.420
What it look like?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.443
Looks like you in the way.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.620
Like I said, two television stands.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.380
Living room...

21:53.480 --> 21:55.580
One original maple bar, please.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.444
Original, my ass.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.100
Where'd you get that necklace, daddy?

22:02.200 --> 22:03.940
It's Elvis Aaron Presley.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.041
I know who you are.

22:06.920 --> 22:07.980
Well...

22:08.080 --> 22:10.128
My boys, they had it made for me.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.220
It has all their names on it, on this tree.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.367
Tree of Life.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.085
Sweet.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.604
I got mine at a store.

22:20.880 --> 22:21.881
Sweet.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.460
I see you got some sweet rings there, too.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.561
Yeah.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.488
Before you go getting any ideas,

22:31.680 --> 22:33.860
you should know that we aim to keep them.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.200
Who's "we"?

22:35.560 --> 22:36.766
Me and Lucille.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.520
Got it?

22:49.720 --> 22:52.724
You somethin' else, baby.
You all right, man.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.442
Thank you. Thank you very much.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.805
Jerry. Sonny.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.010
You gotta try one of these
original "my ass" maple bars.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.722
Yeah. I think we should
head back to the hotel.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.844
Just in case we get that phone call.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.171
Two more maple bars, please.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.260
Are you sure it's him?

23:30.360 --> 23:32.020
I know it sounds crazy,

23:32.120 --> 23:35.180
but he literally
just walked up to the gate.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.300
- You wanna bring him in today?
- Yes.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.209
- When?
- End of open hour.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.006
Well, that's the President's nap time.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.100
We understand that, sir, but...

23:43.200 --> 23:44.804
All right, you got the letter?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.360
Read it to me.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.500
"Dear Mr. President.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.940
"First, I would like
to introduce myself..."

23:51.040 --> 23:52.565
Not in his goddamn voice.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.300
Sorry.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.540
"I am Elvis Presley and I admire you

23:57.640 --> 23:59.722
"and have great respect for your office.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.940
"I talked to Vice President Agnew

24:02.040 --> 24:04.220
"in Palm Springs three weeks ago

24:04.320 --> 24:06.260
"and expressed my concern for our country."

24:06.360 --> 24:08.044
- Is that true?
- I believe so.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.860
- Continue.
- "The drug culture,

24:09.960 --> 24:13.340
"the hippie elements, the SDS,
Black Panthers, etcetera,

24:13.440 --> 24:15.140
"do not consider me as their enemy

24:15.240 --> 24:17.481
"or as they call it, the establishment.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.660
"I call it America and I love it."

24:19.760 --> 24:20.860
- Here comes his pitch.
- "Sir,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.100
"I can and will be of any service

24:23.200 --> 24:24.964
"that I can to help the country out.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.282
"So I wish not to be given a title

24:27.400 --> 24:28.640
"or an appointed position.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.460
"I can and will do more good

24:31.560 --> 24:34.300
"if I were made a Federal Agent-At-Large

24:34.400 --> 24:36.580
"and I will help out by doing it my way..."

24:36.680 --> 24:39.300
First he says he doesn't want a title,

24:39.400 --> 24:42.483
the next sentence he's requesting
to be made a Federal Agent-At-Large?

24:44.600 --> 24:47.001
"First and foremost, I am an entertainer

24:47.280 --> 24:49.203
"but all I need
is the federal credentials."

24:49.560 --> 24:51.324
Let me see that.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.700
"...so you can better
understand my approach.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.486
"I would love to meet you and just
say hello if you're not too busy."

24:58.600 --> 24:59.886
Is this a fucking joke?

25:00.080 --> 25:02.686
Just out of curiosity,
what is a Federal Agent-At-Large?

25:02.880 --> 25:03.940
No such thing.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.500
Actually, sir, I looked into it,
there is such a thing.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.762
No such thing. There's no such thing.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.811
Well, is there something else
that we can give him?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.769
An honorary badge?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.620
Sir, if I may,

25:16.720 --> 25:18.500
if the American public saw

25:18.600 --> 25:21.046
that President Nixon has a relationship

25:21.320 --> 25:25.086
with the most influential entertainer
on the planet,

25:26.600 --> 25:27.806
that could go a long way.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.060
I mean, not just
with our anti-drug initiatives

25:30.160 --> 25:31.286
but more importantly,

25:31.640 --> 25:33.768
well, he could really help us
with the youth vote.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.140
And we know we have
an image problem with the youth.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.369
I mean, this is a brilliant
opportunity for us.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.482
I typed up a memo for you to sign.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.284
I don't give a fuck about the youth vote.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.567
Here's what I think of Elvis Presley

25:47.880 --> 25:51.487
meeting the President
of the United States of America.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.446
"You must be kidding!"

25:55.360 --> 25:57.010
It's not just the youth vote.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.324
Everybody loves Elvis.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.523
Old people. Women.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.405
Every single voter
in the South loves Elvis.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.209
Okay. You got my approval.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.164
Now you just need Nixon's.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.100
Any word from the big man?

26:23.200 --> 26:24.260
- Not yet.
- Damn!

26:24.360 --> 26:27.170
But I'm sure they'll call
as soon as they get the letter.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.682
So, I've got a flight to catch.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.740
You want me to call
the President of Paramount?

26:32.840 --> 26:33.841
I can do that for you.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.580
Nah, I got a dinner tonight.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.523
I'm meeting Charlotte's parents.

26:37.640 --> 26:41.361
Oh, really? Hey, why don't I call
that nice little dress shop down in Memphis?

26:41.480 --> 26:43.420
The one Cilla likes.
I can get something nice for Charlotte.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.580
She'll forget all about it.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.841
I don't think that's gonna work.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.526
- Oh, yeah? Works with Cilla.
- You sure about that?

26:52.440 --> 26:54.204
- Sorry.
- Are you?

26:55.040 --> 26:58.283
But I came, and you don't need me now.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.660
You got Sonny, he can take care of things.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.020
Well, Jerry, you're my head of PR.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.441
And this is a PR thing, so...

27:06.160 --> 27:07.207
I need you.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.441
Hairspray.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.820
Grown man using hairspray.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.900
Look at this, man,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.580
that's my black hair dye right there.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.081
And then I got
four different kinds of face cream.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.100
You know what this is? Hemorrhoid cream.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.441
They say it gets rid of the puffiness
under your eyes.

27:28.240 --> 27:32.131
Then I put on these rings
and throw on all this junk.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.620
And I become a thing.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.245
I become an object, you know.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.085
No different than a bottle of Coke.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.500
You see, the difference
between me and you, Jerry,

27:42.600 --> 27:44.660
is that when you walk into a room,

27:44.760 --> 27:46.603
everybody sees Jerry. Right?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.164
And when I walk into a room,

27:51.720 --> 27:54.500
everybody remembers their first kiss

27:54.600 --> 27:57.001
with one of my songs
playing in the background.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.780
Maybe they remember the moment
when their girlfriend

27:59.880 --> 28:02.611
split up with them
after she saw Blue Hawaii.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.083
But they never see me.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.801
They never see that boy
from Memphis, Tennessee.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.687
He's buried, Jerry. They buried him so deep

28:21.320 --> 28:23.766
under gold jewelry and money.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.805
Flash bulbs,

28:27.880 --> 28:30.406
stage make-up, screaming fans.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.920
I don't even know
if I know who he is anymore.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.286
But you do.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.700
You know him. You know him.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.963
You know this boy from Memphis, Tennessee.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.646
The real Elvis.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.961
The person.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.570
I need you, brother.

29:04.760 --> 29:05.886
Why don't you come home?

29:11.560 --> 29:14.370
All right,
I got an appointment I gotta keep.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.100
Look, Jerry, do me a favor,

29:19.200 --> 29:22.060
just stick around for a little while
in case the big man calls, all right?

29:22.160 --> 29:23.300
Okay.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.526
What's the appointment?

29:26.760 --> 29:28.762
Insurance. Just in case.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.180
Where's the damn telephone?

29:35.280 --> 29:36.327
It's this way.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.047
He's coming here. Now.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.780
I never thought he would call.
I gave him my card backstage

29:48.880 --> 29:51.260
and thought that was the end of it.
Oh, my God.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.580
You have to watch my phones,
I have to put my face on.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.820
Oh, my God, why did I wear this today?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.220
What are you talking about?
You're acting crazy!

29:56.320 --> 29:57.780
Elvis! Elvis Presley!

29:57.880 --> 29:59.291
Elvis is coming here!

30:06.200 --> 30:07.690
Hey, ladies.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.164
Mary Anne Peterson.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.642
I'm so glad you called.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.442
I can't believe you remember my name.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.081
Well, I remember that face even more.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.967
So, what are you doing
in Washington, D.C., Mr. Presley?

30:31.120 --> 30:32.929
Well, Mary Anne, it's top secret.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.003
But the minute I met you
I knew you were a woman of discretion.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.291
I want a meeting with J. Edgar Hoover.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.443
Well, that's
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.047
But your department
falls under that, correct?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.500
Well...

30:53.600 --> 30:56.843
I don't know if I can get you
a meeting with Mr. Hoover.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.531
Well now, Mary Anne,
it's a matter of national security.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.180
I can't tell you what
it's about at this moment,

31:04.280 --> 31:08.060
but is there any chance I could meet
with the head honcho around here?

31:08.160 --> 31:09.366
Maybe he could help.

31:10.440 --> 31:12.283
Mr. Finlator? You have a visitor.

31:14.680 --> 31:15.681
I have to be at the White House...

31:15.880 --> 31:17.609
It's Elvis Presley.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.086
Mr. Presley.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.940
This is Mr. Finlator.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.740
Deputy Director of the Bureau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.366
Mr. Finlator, this is Mr. Elvis Presley.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.081
Famous person.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.211
I know who Mr. Presley is.
Your reputation precedes you.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.762
- Call me Elvis.
- Yeah.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.249
What can I help you with, Elvis?

31:38.360 --> 31:40.727
- Thank you, Mary Anne.
- You're welcome.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.860
May I sit down?

31:45.960 --> 31:47.166
Yeah, no. Please, have a seat.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.540
Well, sir, I was going to go directly
to President Nixon

31:50.640 --> 31:53.211
but I decided
it was best to start at the top.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.060
Not sure I follow.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.780
Well, I am concerned

31:58.880 --> 32:01.140
about the youth of our country

32:01.240 --> 32:03.500
and I would like to go undercover

32:03.600 --> 32:04.886
as a federal agent.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.740
You want to be a federal agent?

32:08.840 --> 32:11.260
Yes, sir. You know,
I have a military background.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.380
I've always had a deep and abiding interest

32:13.480 --> 32:14.891
in law enforcement.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.660
I'd like to do whatever I can
whenever I can for the police,

32:17.760 --> 32:19.540
I visit local police departments

32:19.640 --> 32:21.051
from time to time.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.700
I regularly give a little donation

32:23.800 --> 32:26.326
to their funds or benefits.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.540
And in exchange
they usually give me a badge.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.780
Or a citation.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.530
But mostly just badges.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.700
Those are local law enforcement badges.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.820
Federal badges, you understand,

32:40.920 --> 32:45.100
come with many more responsibilities
and privileges.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.460
Of course.
That's exactly why I'm here, sir.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.420
And I understand the gravity

32:49.520 --> 32:51.620
of what I'm asking you for, so...

32:51.720 --> 32:54.420
I'm willing to do whatever I can for

32:54.520 --> 32:56.409
you and your department, you know.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.166
Whatever it takes.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.620
We can't do that.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.900
We can't take donations.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.860
We are fully funded by the government.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.325
We are the government.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.180
Really, I'd love to help you
with this but...

33:14.280 --> 33:17.940
Because I'm a big fan from way back.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.020
Let me ask you,

33:19.120 --> 33:22.340
have you looked into the FBI credentials?

33:22.440 --> 33:24.408
Collectors really keep their eye out

33:24.520 --> 33:25.900
for that FBI badge.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.500
Well, sir, I don't mean to be rude,

33:27.600 --> 33:29.140
but I didn't travel all the way

33:29.240 --> 33:31.481
to our nation's capital
to work for the FBI.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.060
I believe the drug culture
is ruining our youth.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.580
This is a drug issue.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.091
And I am here specifically

33:37.200 --> 33:39.441
to be an agent for the Bureau of Narcotics.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.083
- You're serious?
- Oh, yes, sir.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.602
An undercover rock and roller.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.126
Sounds ludicrous, but...

33:51.080 --> 33:52.820
Truth is, not in a million years

33:52.920 --> 33:55.060
would a dealer ever see you coming.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.980
You see, sir, that's just the thing.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.980
You got to understand.
I've been in 31 major motion pictures,

34:00.080 --> 34:02.820
that makes me an expert
in costume and disguise.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.048
You may not know this,
but I have a black belt in karate.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.567
I've studied kenpo and tae kwon do.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.129
I can supply my own firearms.

34:11.440 --> 34:15.047
But I'm also willing to submit
to whatever training you deem necessary.

34:16.080 --> 34:19.420
Mr. Presley. I really respect
everything you're doing

34:19.520 --> 34:21.500
in our fight against drugs.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.601
Thank you, sir.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.281
But I...

34:26.800 --> 34:28.940
Don't really have the authority

34:29.040 --> 34:31.360
to make you an undercover agent.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.844
Undercover agent-at-large?

34:34.560 --> 34:35.766
That, either.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.699
- I'll tell you what I can do.
- Okay.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.300
I can have Mary Anne take you down to
one of the gift shops

34:42.400 --> 34:43.606
across the street.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.460
They sell badges, very authentic replicas.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.739
The kind they use in the films

34:48.840 --> 34:51.650
and I know they're very popular,
especially with the kids.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.840
Mr. Finlator, you know what?

35:00.320 --> 35:02.420
I don't need a kiddie badge.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.420
I'm not a child. I am a grown man.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.682
I intend to be treated as such.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.204
Elvis. Mr. Presley?

35:13.280 --> 35:14.566
Call me?

35:17.400 --> 35:18.811
What did you say to him?

35:20.080 --> 35:21.206
Nothing!

35:21.920 --> 35:23.251
Nothing. I...

35:25.000 --> 35:27.287
Can you believe this, man?
The White House?

35:27.760 --> 35:30.060
You think they'll let me have
a souvenir or something?

35:30.160 --> 35:31.860
- Probably not.
- For my pop.

35:31.960 --> 35:35.369
Not like a painting of Jefferson
or anything, but just an ashtray.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.291
There's my steak Diane.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.820
Good morning.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.460
Your steak and eggs, Mr. West.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.403
Thank you, Diane.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.243
Bring it right over here. Thank you.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.500
Are you here to meet Elvis, too?

35:56.600 --> 35:58.125
Nah, he's just the hired help.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.601
Just kidding. He's with us.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.700
Like I said, Mr. West,

36:01.800 --> 36:03.340
I'd do anything to meet the King.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.780
He's just my favorite.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.820
You know, I've seen Blue Hawaii
at least 17 times.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.684
I got some of his stuff here
if you wanna see it.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.180
- Hello?
- Mr. Schilling,

36:15.280 --> 36:16.420
this is Bud Krogh,

36:16.520 --> 36:18.420
Deputy Assistant for Domestic Affairs.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.420
Thank you, sir, for calling.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.540
I'm hoping it's good news?

36:21.640 --> 36:24.300
Well, we're about 90% positive

36:24.400 --> 36:26.300
we'll be able to get him in today.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.811
He'll still be in town, right?

36:28.400 --> 36:29.580
Absolutely.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.340
This meeting is very important
to Mr. Presley.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.125
It is very important to us as well.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.180
We're about to go in
and pitch the President,

36:38.280 --> 36:41.700
so, should we get a yes, I can
reach you at this phone number?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.700
Yes! Yes, I will be here.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.406
- Okay Good.
- Thank you.

36:46.840 --> 36:50.740
And, Mr. Schilling,
do you think it'll be possible

36:50.840 --> 36:53.571
for us to get a picture with Mr. Presley?

36:55.840 --> 36:57.540
Who the fuck set this up?

36:57.640 --> 36:59.020
Actually, he did, sir.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.820
Mr. Presley made an unscheduled appearance

37:00.920 --> 37:02.570
at the Northwest Gate this morning.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.660
Seeing as though he is only in town

37:04.760 --> 37:07.820
for a couple of days, we thought
that it would be a good opportunity

37:07.920 --> 37:10.140
to invite him to work with us.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.740
He could really bring
a more positive attitude

37:12.840 --> 37:14.171
to young people throughout the country.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.286
I see.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.340
And you think we should meet with him?

37:19.440 --> 37:20.521
Yes, Mr. President.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.651
During my nap hour?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.420
Well, sir, between his television
and radio appearances

37:26.520 --> 37:27.940
he has a very broad reach

37:28.040 --> 37:29.860
to the very demographic we are targeting.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.300
In fact, Bud has put together

37:31.400 --> 37:33.540
some figures as talking points. Bud.

37:33.640 --> 37:36.220
This year, over a thousand people
in New York alone

37:36.320 --> 37:37.924
have died from narcotic related deaths.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.700
A hundred and eight of those, teenagers.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.860
Now, as Dwight has stated,

37:41.960 --> 37:45.540
Mr. Presley has a very wide following
in the entertainment industry.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.820
We thought maybe we could produce
a television special with him.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.500
What sort of television special?

37:50.600 --> 37:54.980
We're considering a fun yet informative
documentary-type program.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.020
A mix of music and interviews with say,

37:58.120 --> 38:00.420
world's top physicians and psychiatrists

38:00.520 --> 38:02.682
discussing the dangers of addiction.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.580
What exactly would he be doing

38:04.680 --> 38:06.569
on this television special of ours?

38:07.440 --> 38:09.780
Well, we were thinking
that he could perform

38:09.880 --> 38:11.900
some drug-themed songs

38:12.000 --> 38:14.060
that the kids are listening to these days,

38:14.160 --> 38:15.740
and then interpret it for the parents,

38:15.840 --> 38:17.860
so that they can get a better understanding

38:17.960 --> 38:21.620
of how drugs
and other anti-establishment themes

38:21.720 --> 38:23.563
have infiltrated rock and roll music.

38:23.760 --> 38:24.860
Maybe we could encourage him

38:24.960 --> 38:27.300
to ask some of his fellow artists
to join the campaign.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.860
Maybe get together
to develop some kind of new

38:29.960 --> 38:31.220
rock and roll musical theme.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.660
I see. You mean like,

38:32.760 --> 38:34.820
sing a song, together. That sort of thing.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.100
Yeah, you know,
hip but with an appropriate theme.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.646
Something like maybe, "Get High on Life."

38:41.960 --> 38:43.380
"Get High on Life." I like that.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.720
That's good. Yeah.

38:46.840 --> 38:47.841
What else?

38:49.000 --> 38:50.180
Well, that would be it, sir.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.124
Actually... Unfortunately, yeah...

38:53.400 --> 38:54.925
He would also like a badge.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.740
- A what?
- A badge.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.980
He'd like to be made
a Federal Agent-At-Large.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.845
And it's really important for him
to get that badge.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.811
I see...

39:06.440 --> 39:08.044
I see. Right.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.291
So, Mr. President, shall we set this up?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.001
No.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.260
- But, Mr. President...
- I'm not bringing

39:22.360 --> 39:23.580
some goddamn rock and roller

39:23.680 --> 39:25.340
into the Oval Office, for Pete's sake!

39:25.440 --> 39:26.580
Now, Jesus Christ,

39:26.680 --> 39:29.780
I mean, you tell him
he should try again next time.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.340
You know, maybe he'll have better luck
when a Democrat gets elected.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.700
Now, what the hell is going on

39:33.800 --> 39:35.540
with Ford's counterpart in the House?

39:35.640 --> 39:38.740
I read this cockamamie story
in the Star last night,

39:38.840 --> 39:40.660
it's the most ridiculous thing.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.922
I mean, he's on the sauce, isn't that it?

39:44.280 --> 39:46.420
- Dammit.
- I thought we had him.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.126
Nah. He knew it was a "no"
before we even set foot in that room.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.900
I hate it when he does that.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.002
It's like he enjoys stringing people along,
you know.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.366
He does.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.220
- So, now what?
- We take it all the way

39:58.320 --> 39:59.367
to the Supreme Court?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.125
Really funny.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.687
Yeah. Just let me deliver the bad news.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.500
- Can I try them on?
- Yeah.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.140
I can't believe
I'm trying on Elvis' glasses.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.340
You're really hot!

40:25.440 --> 40:27.620
- Really?
- Yeah!

40:27.720 --> 40:29.051
You're so pretty.

40:33.800 --> 40:34.847
Hey.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.165
I was just showing her your glasses.

40:37.840 --> 40:38.841
All right.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.204
Should I get her out of here?

40:42.360 --> 40:43.725
Good idea.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.001
Yeah, what?

40:52.160 --> 40:53.764
Elvis...

40:55.160 --> 40:56.571
Nixon can't meet you.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.645
Well, we'll do it tomorrow then.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.366
He can't do it tomorrow.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.500
How about this weekend?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.220
I'll stay as long as it takes.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.641
He can't do today and he can't do tomorrow.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.371
He just...

41:09.120 --> 41:11.851
He just doesn't wanna meet you.

41:15.880 --> 41:17.166
I'm sorry.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.900
I think I need some fresh air.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.220
- I'll come with you.
- No.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.651
I can get it myself.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.011
Thank you.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.686
Who's he?

43:11.080 --> 43:13.208
- He's our driver.
- He's down.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.404
Meaning he's hip.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.481
He's cool.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.401
Walk with us.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.769
Look, we wanna make this work
just as much as you guys,

43:23.880 --> 43:26.565
but he just doesn't see
the value in meeting Elvis.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.569
So there's nothing we can do today?

43:29.080 --> 43:30.081
Nope.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.700
What about tomorrow?

43:31.800 --> 43:32.961
No.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.260
How about something casual,

43:35.360 --> 43:37.460
not even a meeting?

43:37.560 --> 43:39.483
Like a drink or something?

43:40.120 --> 43:41.610
Look, Jerry...

43:43.400 --> 43:44.401
We tried.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.171
He's just...

43:47.040 --> 43:48.451
Nixon is...

43:51.840 --> 43:53.460
He's just old fashioned, all right.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.700
He's from a different era.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.620
What about Saturday? Maybe a coffee?

43:56.720 --> 43:57.740
No, no, no.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.420
The President is going to be
at Camp David all weekend

43:59.520 --> 44:00.885
with his wife and daughters.

44:02.280 --> 44:03.691
His daughters?

44:06.080 --> 44:08.731
Yeah. Gentlemen,
I think we have a solution.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.882
Mr. President. Julie is on four.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.282
My Julie. Sweetheart.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.050
Well, I just...

44:31.920 --> 44:33.684
Well, I just didn't think to tell...

44:35.480 --> 44:38.723
Well, look, Julie,
your father's very busy today, you know...

44:40.720 --> 44:41.881
Bud.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.442
President's been looking for you two.

44:45.840 --> 44:48.286
Was he pissed or only mildly annoyed?

44:49.120 --> 44:52.220
So you two thought
this would be a good idea?

44:52.320 --> 44:54.660
- Mr. President, I had nothing to do with this.
- Sir, we just...

44:54.760 --> 44:56.980
Well, it doesn't make
any goddamn difference now, does it?

44:57.080 --> 44:58.620
Because the leader of the free world

44:58.720 --> 45:01.166
is taking orders
from a 22-year-old college girl.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.220
Fine, bring him in.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.420
Get an autograph for Julie and a picture.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.329
And I want him out in five minutes tops.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.780
And you'd better get me a bio on this Elvis

45:09.880 --> 45:12.611
so I can prep for this goddamn meeting.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.445
Jerry Schilling speaking.

45:20.440 --> 45:21.521
Thank you.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.967
Well, guess it's back to Memphis.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.450
I don't think that's a good idea.

45:43.200 --> 45:44.281
How come?

45:44.760 --> 45:46.250
Well, because...

45:47.360 --> 45:50.060
You, Mr. Presley,
have a meeting with the President

45:50.160 --> 45:51.889
of the United States of America.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.366
Hot damn!

46:27.880 --> 46:29.120
There he is!

46:31.120 --> 46:32.724
Well, what do you think?

46:33.000 --> 46:35.401
Damn, boss,
you look hotter-than-a-whorehouse great.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.770
Let's do this thing.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.406
Jerry, I just want to thank you, man,
for putting this together.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.660
I don't know how you did it,

46:56.760 --> 46:59.047
but I couldn't have done it
without you, man.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.166
You too, Sonny.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.140
Yeah. I never thought
I'd get to meet a president.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.322
Thank you. And thank you, boss.

47:07.800 --> 47:10.121
It means a lot to me
to know that, you know,

47:11.120 --> 47:12.610
I have friends.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.540
Mr. Barrow?

47:29.640 --> 47:30.740
Burrows.

47:30.840 --> 47:33.684
Nice to meet you.
I'm Mr. Krogh's assistant.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.300
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.420
Nice to meet you.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.568
- Welcome to the White House.
- Thank you, ma'am.

47:40.040 --> 47:41.804
Beautiful, isn't it, Mr. Presley?

47:42.080 --> 47:43.206
Yeah.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.604
Looks a little like my place.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.620
Mr. Presley, I'm Agent Duncan.

47:59.720 --> 48:00.780
This is Agent Moroder.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.645
Agent Duncan. Agent Moroder.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.140
It's an honor.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.321
Identification.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.843
Let's show him our IDs, boys.

48:10.640 --> 48:11.880
Will that do?

48:12.600 --> 48:14.260
Is this the only identification you have?

48:14.360 --> 48:17.687
No, sir. That there is my Special Deputy's
badge from my hometown of Memphis.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.260
I brought a couple of others
from various different locales

48:20.360 --> 48:21.340
if you need to see them.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.487
That's not necessary.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.926
And what about you, gentlemen?

48:26.240 --> 48:27.321
And that's your only ID?

48:29.240 --> 48:31.500
Okay, sir, do you have any
illegal firearms or weapons

48:31.600 --> 48:33.250
- on or about your person?
- No, sir.

48:33.520 --> 48:34.806
- If I may?
- Of course.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.460
Sir, I'm going to ask you again.

48:42.560 --> 48:45.740
Do you have any firearms or weapons
of any kind on your person?

48:45.840 --> 48:46.887
Yes, sir. I do.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.260
Do your associates?

48:49.360 --> 48:50.900
That would be the affirmative.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.860
Why, when I asked you previously,

48:52.960 --> 48:54.260
did you reply in the negative?

48:54.360 --> 48:57.780
Well, I believe you said "illegal" firearms,
and these firearms are not illegal.

48:57.880 --> 49:00.420
We are licensed to carry them
as Special Sheriff's Deputies

49:00.520 --> 49:03.683
of Shelby County
under Tennessean Code 39-49.

49:05.960 --> 49:08.167
Okay, gentlemen.
All your weapons on the table.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.361
There we go.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.860
What's in the box?

49:19.960 --> 49:21.940
This is a personal gift for the President.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.100
Open it, please.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.620
Sir, I had it very specially wrapped.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.165
Open the package.

49:27.160 --> 49:28.446
Go ahead, Jerry.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.084
This is Bud Krogh.

49:51.680 --> 49:53.091
Mr. Presley.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.740
Bud Krogh.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.285
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.980
Mr. Presley would like to bring firearms

49:59.080 --> 50:00.140
into the Oval Office.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.241
As a gift.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.244
In the display case here.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.521
Wow, it's beautiful.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.361
It's commemorative.

50:14.840 --> 50:16.900
Obviously you can appreciate

50:17.000 --> 50:19.002
the uniqueness of this scenario.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.921
All right, gentlemen, let me be clear
so there is no misunderstanding.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.300
We don't allow weapons of any kind
in the White House.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.380
Including this gift,

50:27.480 --> 50:29.980
which I will accept
on the President's behalf.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.605
After inspecting it,

50:32.640 --> 50:35.211
it possibly will find its way
to the President.

50:37.760 --> 50:38.820
Thank you, sir.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.940
I am a fan of all you do for our country.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.180
I am sorry about that.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.500
The Secret Service can be
a bit overzealous sometimes.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.540
That's all right, Bud. Hey...

50:46.640 --> 50:49.620
It's a good thing they didn't catch
this little fella in my boot.

50:49.720 --> 50:50.767
Just kidding.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.001
Right this way.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.980
I hope you gentlemen don't mind,

50:57.080 --> 50:59.048
I need you to wait in my office
for a brief moment.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.286
Not at all, Bud.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.660
Please, step right in,

51:03.760 --> 51:05.285
make yourselves comfortable.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.720
I'll be right back.

51:11.320 --> 51:13.846
Elvis Presley is in the building!

51:18.560 --> 51:21.291
I can't believe
I'm actually going to see the Oval Office.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.808
Glad you left L.A. now, aren't you?

51:26.880 --> 51:28.820
Gentlemen, Mr. Presley,

51:28.920 --> 51:30.700
I'd like to introduce you to Dwight Chapin.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.780
He's the special assistant
to the President.

51:32.880 --> 51:34.723
It's a huge honor, Elvis.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.529
I mean, Mr. Presley.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.620
Now, before I take you to the President

51:41.720 --> 51:43.460
we're going to have
to go over the protocol.

51:43.560 --> 51:44.971
So, Mr. Presley,
if you'll please follow me...

51:45.080 --> 51:46.969
- Protocol?
- Yes, sir.

51:49.720 --> 51:50.740
No.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.660
I'm sorry, only Mr. Presley

51:52.760 --> 51:54.140
will be allowed in the Oval Office.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.241
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.886
My apologies.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.201
Damn.

52:01.200 --> 52:04.980
Well, why don't you give Dwight,
or Mr. Chapin,

52:05.080 --> 52:06.320
the rundown too.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.525
Rundown for what?

52:14.120 --> 52:17.203
After I announce you,
you may enter the Oval Office.

52:17.320 --> 52:19.129
The President will be seated at his desk.

52:19.240 --> 52:22.289
But please wait by the door
until he addresses you.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.660
Of course.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.140
Mr. Presley will enter.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.660
If he leaves his sunglasses on
then Nixon should wait

52:27.760 --> 52:29.125
until Mr. Presley speaks.

52:30.680 --> 52:32.940
His sunglasses?

52:33.040 --> 52:34.540
The President will then shake your hand.

52:34.640 --> 52:38.500
And then invite you to sit down,
he will instruct you where to do so.

52:38.600 --> 52:39.681
Roger that.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.740
But if Elvis removes his sunglasses,

52:41.840 --> 52:44.320
that means
somebody's about to get a bear hug.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.700
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.980
On the coffee table

52:48.080 --> 52:50.060
is an unopened bottle of Dr. Pepper.

52:50.160 --> 52:52.500
Please do not open it.
Please do not drink from it.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.489
Because it's only for the President.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.580
Now as for food,

52:57.680 --> 53:00.860
we usually make sure that Elvis
has a selection of drinks at his disposal.

53:00.960 --> 53:01.980
You know, nothing major,

53:02.080 --> 53:05.220
just some hot tea with lemon, sodas, water.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.971
Some snacks. Nice ones.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.820
There is also, on the coffee table,

53:09.920 --> 53:11.100
a divided dish

53:11.200 --> 53:14.170
with mixed nuts on one side,
M&Ms on the other.

53:14.600 --> 53:15.900
I do like M&Ms.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.288
Well, I'm sorry, but those are also
only for the President.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.489
Should we tell him about the karate?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.081
Karate?

53:24.600 --> 53:28.047
All right, you ready to meet
the President of the United States?

53:29.280 --> 53:30.361
You betcha.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.340
Now, if you'll wait right here please, sir,

53:50.440 --> 53:51.771
I'll be right back.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.047
It's an honor, Mr. President.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.260
Mr. President, I can't tell you

54:06.360 --> 54:07.964
what a great honor...

54:14.400 --> 54:17.085
Hello, Mr. President, the honor...

54:29.600 --> 54:32.140
Did you know
I had a twin brother, Mr. President?

54:32.240 --> 54:33.287
Identical.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.044
Jesse Garon Presley.

54:38.600 --> 54:41.570
He was born 35 minutes before me.
Stillborn.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.481
And they...

54:46.920 --> 54:49.100
They put him in a box on the kitchen table

54:49.200 --> 54:51.806
while Momma kept on going
trying to push me out.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.300
Sometimes I wonder about that, you know.

54:57.400 --> 55:00.420
What that 35 minutes
must have been like for her.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.980
The happiest moment

55:03.080 --> 55:04.300
and the saddest moment

55:04.400 --> 55:06.243
life could possibly throw at you.

55:10.880 --> 55:13.700
Sometimes I think God felt guilty for her,

55:13.800 --> 55:17.009
so he gave me the luck
that was meant for two people.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.690
Makes you think, you know.

55:25.960 --> 55:28.020
And I want Mr. Kissinger

55:28.120 --> 55:29.804
and the Speaker in this meeting.

55:31.080 --> 55:34.020
Mr. President.
Are you ready for Mr. Presley?

55:34.120 --> 55:35.180
Yeah.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.860
And Krogh, no more than five minutes.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.220
I want you to come
in exactly at five minutes

55:40.320 --> 55:41.820
and say I have to be somewhere.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.660
- Where shall I say you...
- Well, I don't care.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.205
Just make up some bullshit.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.340
Yes, sir.

55:46.440 --> 55:47.521
Krogh...

55:51.640 --> 55:53.340
What do we have on this guy?

55:53.440 --> 55:55.180
You know, deep background.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.300
Well, besides yourself,

55:56.400 --> 55:59.020
he's one of the most famous men
on the planet.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.884
He's married. He travels a lot.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.100
Loves guns. Hates The Beatles.
Black belt in karate.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.680
- Big football fan...
- Karate. You don't say?

56:06.800 --> 56:08.962
Yes, sir. Shall I bring him in?

56:10.480 --> 56:11.527
Hey, Krogh.

56:13.960 --> 56:15.420
Let me ask you something.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.204
Do you think I could take him?

56:19.280 --> 56:21.940
- Take him, sir?
- In karate.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.327
You think I could take him down?

56:24.440 --> 56:25.740
I bet you in my day I could've.

56:25.840 --> 56:28.660
You know, I used to be able to
bench-press 220.

56:28.760 --> 56:30.046
Of course, he's young and...

56:30.880 --> 56:32.540
Good-looking too.

56:32.640 --> 56:35.041
You know, Krogh, guys like that,

56:35.160 --> 56:36.780
who are just born good-looking,

56:36.880 --> 56:38.564
well, you obviously know,

56:38.680 --> 56:41.180
they never had to work for it,
if you know what I mean.

56:41.280 --> 56:44.260
Not me.
No, I had to make something of myself

56:44.360 --> 56:46.540
to get a girl to notice me.

56:46.640 --> 56:50.500
It wasn't just handed to me
by some sort of genetic lottery.

56:50.600 --> 56:53.080
I wasn't born
looking like a Kennedy, you know.

56:53.520 --> 56:55.921
But that's why guys like me are survivors.

56:56.800 --> 57:00.180
Guys like this Elvis fellow...

57:00.280 --> 57:03.124
No, underneath all that, they're weak.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.481
They wither at the first sign of trouble.

57:07.440 --> 57:10.728
They just crumble like a sand dune.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.420
All right, let's bring him in.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.851
Yes, sir.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.740
Mr. Presley.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.444
The President will see you now.

57:27.680 --> 57:28.681
Mr. President.

57:29.120 --> 57:30.690
Mr. Elvis Presley.

57:31.320 --> 57:34.529
Well, Mr. Presley. It is a pleasure.

57:50.200 --> 57:52.460
You know what that is? That's a moon rock.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.881
Very proud to have that here
in the Oval Office.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.940
That was given to me personally

57:57.040 --> 57:59.361
by a great American, Mr. Buzz Aldrin.

57:59.840 --> 58:03.367
You can lift the glass there
and pick it up if you like.

58:04.520 --> 58:05.567
No, that's cool, man.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.080
Buzz sent me one, too.

58:08.720 --> 58:11.540
He did? Well, of course he did.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.220
Mr. President. Put her right there!

58:13.320 --> 58:15.209
Well, okay. Hello!

58:17.480 --> 58:18.980
Why don't you have a seat.

58:19.080 --> 58:20.081
Sure thing.

58:27.680 --> 58:29.140
It's a great place you got here, huh?

58:29.240 --> 58:31.500
Well, it's really the people's house.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.763
I'm just a temporary guest, as they say.

58:35.360 --> 58:36.441
That's right.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.763
I was telling one of the gals outside
it reminds me of my Graceland.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.245
It does, does it?

58:43.240 --> 58:46.449
How many square feet
is this Graceland of yours?

58:47.120 --> 58:50.020
Not sure. 10,000, maybe.

58:50.120 --> 58:52.340
Well, that is a fine size for a home.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.780
Isn't it? Well, I mean,
it's more than fine.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.609
Of course,
the White House here is, I think,

58:56.760 --> 58:58.780
about 55,000 feet.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.180
- Something like that.
- Well, actually, I made a few additions,

59:01.280 --> 59:03.442
so, maybe a little more than that.

59:03.560 --> 59:05.642
But I don't think
it's the size of a man's home

59:05.760 --> 59:07.649
that defines him. You know?

59:10.480 --> 59:11.641
M&M's are my favorite.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.125
Mine too.

59:15.600 --> 59:17.967
So, Mr. Presley,

59:19.480 --> 59:20.811
how can I help you?

59:21.240 --> 59:23.780
Well, Mr. President, first of all
I want to tell you what an honor it is

59:23.880 --> 59:25.325
to be in your presence.

59:25.560 --> 59:26.766
You have a bottle opener?

59:27.800 --> 59:30.220
Well, there should have been one.

59:30.320 --> 59:31.900
Maybe you could run out
and get him one, Krogh.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.445
Yes, Mr. President.

59:34.840 --> 59:38.242
And get a Dr. Pepper for me too.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.011
It's on its way.

59:42.480 --> 59:43.641
Fuck!

59:44.320 --> 59:46.846
So, I read your letter.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.281
I wrote it on the plane.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.527
I could tell.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.126
Mr. President.

59:53.840 --> 59:57.970
This is my little angel.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.604
Lisa Marie. She's two years old.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.000
Well, she is a beautiful little girl.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.924
Yes, sir. She's my pride and joy.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.648
And this is my beautiful wife, Cilla.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.204
Well, she is very charming.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.326
Mr. President.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.260
- Bud.
- Mr. Presley.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.045
- These M&Ms are great.
- Good to hear, Mr. Presley.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.527
You got some good fellas
working for you, Mr. President.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.011
My guys are outside.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.321
Thank you.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.860
So, as I really do need to be going

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.122
we should probably get to
what you want to...

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.780
These are some of my closest associates.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.042
And contrary to what
you may have heard, Mr. President,

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.725
they are not part of any mafia.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.060
That is just a crazy rumor

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.889
started by nasty journalists.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.089
They love to make it up, don't they?

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.820
Last month, Look magazine
made up some cockamamie drivel

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.940
about how I broke into the Dean's office

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.300
while I was at Duke.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.300
You know, you give a man enough money
and he'll say anything, you know.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.820
They'll just ruin a man's reputation.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.604
They don't give a good goddamn.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.980
They just write what they want.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.445
Hear, hear to that.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.060
Everyone has a badge.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.340
Mr. President, I've shown you these photos

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.820
because I am deeply concerned

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.900
about the direction
our great nation is taking.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.445
Yes, of course.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.727
Now, I'm gonna need
an autograph for my Julie.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.890
That's your family there?

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.611
Those are some good looking kids.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.525
Well, they really take after their mother.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.964
Well, it takes two good lookin' folks to
make a good lookin' baby, Mr. President.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.445
Are you...

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.920
You're saying, as a gentleman,
I'm good looking too?

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.740
Well, of course, Mr. President.
Everybody knows that.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.569
Well, I...

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.404
Now, plainly speaking, sir,

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.700
I want to get people
to respect our country.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.380
To respect our flag.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.608
Because that's what's getting lost
in our nation.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.060
It bothers me to see young people

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.481
burning flags and smoking dope.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.140
And just because
I don't smoke dope or grow a beard

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.481
does that make me a straight? Or a square?

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.900
Because if it does, heck,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.004
I'll take being a straight or a square
any day of the week.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.487
The kids today are being brainwashed,
Mr. President.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.900
It's what they are listenin' to
and what they are watchin'.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.140
That's what's doing it to them.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.580
Take that Woodstock for example.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.740
What the heck was that?

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.740
I'll tell you what it was, it was an excuse

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.002
to get naked, get high
and roll around in the mud.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.700
Well, I'm with you there.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.361
Four, three, two, one...

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.761
Mr. President,
you have your meet and greet.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.369
No, not right now. Thank you.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.740
But it's with the delegation...

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.365
I said it's fine.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.204
- But it's with the donors...
- I said it can wait.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.260
And Krogh, make sure that we get a picture

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.940
with Mr. Presley and me.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.371
Ollie's outside, he's ready for you.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.845
No pictures.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.367
Mr. Presley, it's standard for us.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.041
I understand. But not today.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.482
Now, if you don't mind...

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.002
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.561
- May I continue?
- By all means.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.460
Thank you. I have it on very good authority

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.040
that many of the
so-called underground groups

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.242
have been infiltrated by communists.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.540
Yes, sir.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.802
And I find it downright anti-American.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.251
Just like The Beatles.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.380
The Beatles. Well, I don't like them.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.820
They are anti-American,

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.980
possibly with communist leanings.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.570
Well, just look at them.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.220
Let's look at the facts, Mr. President.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.460
After coming here
and making all that money,

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.403
they split back to England,

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.660
start saying all this anti-American stuff,

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.060
speaking against us in the press.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.083
Well, some people think
they can say anything.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.980
Specifically about our policies

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.420
in Southeast Asia, sir.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.980
Did you know that?

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.660
I did not know that.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.921
It was Lennon.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.442
The kids think he's some kind of prophet.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.260
And well... What I'm trying to say is, sir,

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.260
they may not actually be
in the employ of the communists,

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.380
but if encouraging revolution doesn't
sound like subversive propaganda,

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.721
- I don't know what is.
- Well, right. Yes.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.440
See, I've been studying

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.860
communist brainwashing techniques

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.020
for over 10 years now.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.020
And the drug culture, too, Mr. President.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.647
And it's my belief that
if we don't do something

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.922
to handle this situation very quickly,

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.700
it could very easily get outta hand.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.180
Well, you wanna know why the hell

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.647
the communists are so against drugs?

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.330
It's because they love to booze.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.700
Especially the Russians. I've seen it.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.131
You talk about "out of hand."

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.809
And that's why communists
and the left-wingers

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.220
are clinging to one another,

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.721
because they're trying
to destroy us, Elvis.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.802
I know, sir. Good, honest Americans.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.460
They hate us.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.245
They don't hate us, Elvis,
they hate what we stand for.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.060
I mean, you and me, we rose from nothing.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.900
My pa worked in a grocery store.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.162
Your father was a sharecropper, yes?

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.380
A whole slew of things, sir.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.220
Well, I think we were both somewhat loners.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.527
And look where I am today.
And look where you are.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.687
Well, a lefty sees that,

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.500
and instead of wanting to walk
in our footsteps,

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.931
why, they get jealous.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.526
It brings all their failures up bubbling

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.005
right in front of their faces

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.420
and, well, so, of course

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.420
they react like caged animals.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.860
Because that's what they are.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.008
Just animals.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.522
I know, sir.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.523
And I want to help to stop it.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.100
Well, I think that is just great.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.201
Absolutely.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:58.207
So, my boys were telling me
something like a concert.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.209
A telethon. A television special.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.481
No, sir.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.725
I want to go undercover.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.641
Undercover?

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.201
Yes.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.100
You want to be an actual...

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.326
I'm sorry, you want to what?

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.000
I want to be an agent-at-large.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.220
You see, if I can get
a Federal Narcotics badge

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.060
it is my belief
that I could protect this nation

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.400
from sliding into anarchy.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.980
Well...

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.300
I...

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.927
Let's say I could infiltrate
a band or a hippie commune,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.765
as a spy or a double agent,
something like that,

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.060
only disguising myself as one of them,

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.242
hiding my own true feelings.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.926
Yeah, I'm not sure how...

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.740
Let's say The Rolling Stones,
or the Grateful Dead

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.660
or maybe even the Black Panthers.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.660
Heck, I could probably slip
from one group to the other

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.250
without even being detected.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.887
And then, just when they
let their guard down,

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.611
I'd bust 'em.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.931
I'd bust 'em all.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.820
Of course, I would have to be
so deep undercover

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.100
so that no one would know it was me.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.726
But in order for that to happen, nobody...

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.860
I mean nobody, can know
about this on the outside.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.340
Just a select few.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.442
You, of course, Mr. President...

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.405
And maybe Mr. Hoover.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.540
How much longer is this going to take?

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.211
Is there any way we can speed this up?

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.769
You want me to tell the President
of the United States to speed it up?

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.780
How long does it take
to get to the airport?

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.723
With holiday traffic?

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.482
An hour. An hour and a half.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.801
Shit.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.888
You got somewhere you need to be?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.480
You could say that.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.324
I'm supposed to be meeting
my girlfriend's father for dinner.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.403
I'm going to ask him if I can marry her.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.740
Yeah. Right.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.380
When I first started working at the
White House, the guy that hired Chapin

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.740
told me something I'll never forget.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.971
He said, "Everyone should get married
at least once."

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.006
What's that supposed to mean?

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.451
Well, in our line of work,

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.340
the only ones with marriages intact

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:20.203
are the ones in front of the camera.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.282
And half the time those are just for show.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.740
When you work on the world's biggest stage

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.046
you gotta choose.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.500
You know, I got in a motorcycle accident

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.203
a couple years back in L.A.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.939
A gossip columnist broke the story.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.340
"One of Elvis' buddies
gets in a motorcycle accident

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:45.522
"and breaks his pelvis.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.283
"Good thing it wasn't Elvis."

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.260
Yeah. I carried around that article

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.169
in my pocket for years.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.100
Because it was the first time
that me and him

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.487
were actually mentioned
in a magazine together.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.651
I was actually proud.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.606
So sad.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.849
You know, I got a flight to catch.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.740
I'll make you a deal.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.841
Yes, sir.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.411
We're both realists.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.767
One hand washes the other, right?

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.819
I'll get you your badge.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.660
And we'll have you meet with Hoover

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.660
and he'll do whatever he does

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.500
with all the undercover business,

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.660
and so on and so forth.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.660
- Yes, sir.
- And in return for that...

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.819
- Yep.
- Please, Elvis,

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.921
may I get an autograph for my Julie?

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.444
My pleasure.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.765
And...

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.966
A picture.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.180
Well, sir, I don't know
how I can be undercover...

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.940
We won't release it to the public.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.340
Elvis, please. Help me out here.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.805
Friend to friend.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.940
I'll tell you what, Mr. President.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.644
I'll take that picture

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.808
if you'll take the time to meet my friends.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.123
It sure would mean the world to 'em.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.780
Where are they?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.380
- Right outside.
- Well, let's get them in.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.641
Krogh!

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.961
Three, two, one...

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.460
Now I believe
Elvis would like to get his badge.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.324
I'll make the call right away,
Mr. President.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.329
Gonna get my badge, Mr. Cougar.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.780
Had to slam The Beatles to make it happen

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.300
but they'll never know.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.300
I have to go. I'm sorry, they already
said I won't make my flight.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.140
Jerry, you gotta stick around
and see me get sworn in, man.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.460
- I'm sorry.
- ...arrange for Mr. Presley to be sworn in

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.060
at his hotel room at 3:00.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.844
Would 3:00 work for you, Elvis?

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.485
That would be just fine, Mr. President.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.324
Elvis. I'm leaving.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.005
Don't you want to see this badge?

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.740
Mr. President.
Could you excuse us for one moment?

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.841
Okay.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.205
Mr. President.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.047
Jesus, Jerry, you're embarrassing
the hell out of me, man.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.740
What gives?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.842
- A badge.
- Yeah.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.340
I get it. You want a badge.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.885
Congratulations. You got it.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.020
But now I gotta go home.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.780
Well, let me ask you something, Jerry.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.121
What exactly are you rushing home for?

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.042
My life. Charlotte.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.849
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.180
Jerry, that's fantastic.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.884
- Yeah.
- That's fantastic, man.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.380
Hey. Hey, I'll tell you what.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.050
Charlotte likes horses, right?

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.700
I'm going to call her up
and give her the good news myself.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.882
I'm gonna buy you guys a ranch
right outside Memphis.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.140
You know you don't need to
buy my friendship, right,

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.971
'cause I am your friend.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.980
I don't need your cars

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.730
or your rings or your mansions.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.406
I love you, E.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.887
Not the thing.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.206
The person.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.248
But I have to go home.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.921
Okay?

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.170
Yeah, I get it.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.364
You know you got this, mister.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.091
Excuse me, Mr. President?

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.002
How long does it take you
to get to the airport?

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.763
Well, I don't...

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.281
The motorcade can get us
to National in about seven minutes.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.180
There we go then.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.964
We can set my guy
up with that, right, chief?

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.180
He needs to get back to his girlfriend,
you know how it is.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.442
We absolutely cannot have a civilian
in the transport...

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.800
Chapin, shut up.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.445
It never hurt a man
to bend the rules a little bit.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.500
Yeah? Get this one
an escort to the airport.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.601
I'm done with that.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.961
Yes, sir.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.620
Thank you, sir.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.563
- By all means.
- Thank you.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.931
I'll walk you out, man.
Pardon me, Mr. President.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.780
What in the good God is going on?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.700
- I don't know, sir.
- Jesus Christ, get me Henry.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.801
Yes, sir.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.805
I have to make a classified call...

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.969
- Maybe you could...
- Yes, sir. Yes.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.721
Thank you.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.002
What are you, a fucking potted plant?

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.484
You really are a six, Jerry.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.220
Sixes can be tenacious
in achieving their goals.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.448
Stubborn, until they become
deeply attached.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.580
In which case they are a devout slave

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.603
to those they love.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.220
They also make friends

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.900
more easily than any other number.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.331
With the exception of five.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.849
That's dead-on.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.841
What does it say about eight?

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.327
Oh, boy.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.206
Eights are invariably misunderstood.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.260
Can be quite lonely at heart.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.691
A deep and mercurial nature.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.500
Great spirit of individuality.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.491
And can play an important part
on life's stage.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.888
Although one that is usually fatalistic.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.940
Or as an instrument of fate

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.371
in the lives of others.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.129
Merry Christmas, six.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.010
Merry Christmas, eight.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.620
Yeah, well, I can't make that decision

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.721
until there's evidence...

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.286
I've got to go. I'll call you back, Henry.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.722
Well, it has been a pleasure, Mr. Presley.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.300
And it's a great thing to know

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.563
that we have allies
in the entertainment community.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.846
You made the right choice, sir.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.620
And I swear, I will do whatever I can
to uphold the law, Mr. President.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.140
Well, it means a great deal to us

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.561
that you're so willing to lend a hand.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.980
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.562
And now, as a small token
of my appreciation,

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.140
I would like to present you with a gift.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.480
Sonny?

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.980
Those dudes took it, boss.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.241
Those rent-a-cops out front.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.761
- You mean the Secret Service.
- Yes, sir. They got it.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.820
They've got his gift.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.660
Would you go find it, Chapin,
and bring it back?

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.761
Yes, sir.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.882
Mr. President, you know any karate?

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.722
No. I have to admit
I don't know any karate, no.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.771
Well, it's not just about self-defense.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.420
It's about self-control.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.020
Mind and body discipline, you know.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.260
Would you like to see a demonstration?

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.020
Well, I think we probably have to...

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.360
Sonny.

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.966
All right, where should I...

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.650
No, you just back up, Mr. President.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.481
Fumikiri!

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.369
- Mawashi-geri!
- Mawashi-geri!

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.888
Now, what I basically just said
is that I'm going to engage him in a fumikiri,

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.860
which is like an upward thrust to the jaw
followed by a high kick,

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.090
which most likely in real life
would render the recipient unconscious.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.005
Sonny, come on.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.740
That's how you could
take down your opponent

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.300
in the Shotokan style.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.380
Well, that is very impressive.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.245
That's how I learned
to develop these knuckles of steel.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.084
Hey, come on, feel them.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.965
All right, now slap 'em.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.500
Slap 'em. Come on, harder.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.329
Harder. Let it out. Let it out.

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.526
Those are the steel claws
of a tiger, Mr. President.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.361
Mr. President.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.760
Thanks, boss.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.641
Let me just check this is clear.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.847
Already clear.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.167
Okay.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.726
Fantastic.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.600
This is a chrome-plated,

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.860
World War II commemorative,
Colt model 1911,

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.883
semi-automatic, .45-caliber pistol.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.620
The 1911 is a model
of power and reliability.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.460
And designed by
the great John Moses Browning himself.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.540
Wow!

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.780
I'm sure I don't have to tell you,

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.620
this is a standard issue side arm
of the United States Armed Forces

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.540
and, well, is
my preferred weapon of choice, too, sir.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.042
What is the engraving there, on the side?

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.860
This is a real collector's piece, sir.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.885
You see, it says
"December 11 th, 1941 to May 7th, 1943."

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.540
That is in commemoration of
the European, African,

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.220
and Middle Eastern theater of operations.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.460
Well, that's when I was there. '43.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.721
I know, sir.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.641
That's why I got it for you.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.925
And these here are the...

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.660
Well, that's where the silver bullets
are supposed to be.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.081
I suppose the Secret Service
took care of that.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.060
Well, this is an incredible gift.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.060
And I am so grateful that
you have gotten this for me.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.980
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, sir.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.820
I tried to present Vice President Agnew

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.763
with a very special side arm as well.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.410
But he refused.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.011
Well, that surprises me.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.126
Yeah. Well, he said because
he's an elected official

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.765
he wasn't allowed to accept gifts.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.020
But that he would be glad to accept it
once he left office...

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.451
Excuse me, Mr. President.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.083
Yeah. Good job.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.020
Well, I suppose I should be
getting ready for my shindig.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.441
Well, it's been
an absolute pleasure, Elvis.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.050
Thank you, Mr. President. You as well.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.521
Mr. Presley.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.130
To Julie.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.780
Julie.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.540
What's the matter,
the other one don't like me?

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.020
She likes the Beach Boys.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.940
The Beach Boys.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.405
Good Vibrations.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.020
You want one too, Bud?

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.326
If you don't mind, Mr. Presley.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.169
Of course.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.540
Thank you.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.971
No sweat, man. Sonny.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.161
Sayonara.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.603
Good day. I like him. Let me see that.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.006
"Cool cat."

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.531
You guys think I'm a cool cat?

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.180
I like it. All right.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.520
Get me Henry on the phone.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.041
You know, I've told him 1,000 times,

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.220
we have to wear them down.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.527
We just wear down,
and this whole goddamn thing

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.691
between the Iraqis and the Syrians
will go away in a couple of weeks.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.450
Go on, go on. For God's sake.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.420
- On my honor...
- On my honor...

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.780
I will never betray my badge,

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.220
my integrity,
my character or the public trust.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.260
I will never betray my badge,
my integrity, my character

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.940
or the public trust.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.326
So help me God.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.281
So help me God.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.370
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.680
Well, sweetheart, I'm glad you like it.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.940
Yeah, no, he was very nice.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.724
Yes, very well-informed.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.220
Well, perhaps your dad
is cooler than you'd like to think?

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.731
Damn it.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.011
Yeah, I guess I'm back.
