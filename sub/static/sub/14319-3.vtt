00:04.583 --> 00:07.708
I’m here to make sure
you are still committed
to our purpose,

00:07.708 --> 00:09.875
to destroy the X-Men.

00:09.875 --> 00:14.333

Meet me at these coordinates.

JUBILEE:
Why would Morph
want to hurt us?

00:28.833 --> 00:30.625
BEAST:
Perhaps because
we left him behind.

Yoo-hoo!

00:35.458 --> 00:37.875
Such unexpected
and welcome news!

00:37.875 --> 00:39.708
JUBILEE: Not like the
Morph you used to know.

00:39.708 --> 00:41.458
Morph!
You left me to die!

00:41.458 --> 00:44.166

for a dying man, Magneto.

What do you mean?

who had last words
to share with me!

02:53.166 --> 02:56.458
Something
very odd is happening
in that part of Africa.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.500
I can’t see it,
only sense it.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.416
BEAST: Curious,
that wasn’t there before.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.333
Beast! Jean! Look
what this cat drug in!

03:05.333 --> 03:07.583
Hello, Beast, Jean.

03:07.583 --> 03:08.875
I have missed you.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.583
And I, you!

03:10.583 --> 03:12.375
Out of the hospital so soon?

03:12.375 --> 03:14.833
(CHUCKLES)
She told them
she’d flood the kitchen

03:14.833 --> 03:16.833
if they didn’t
release her today.

03:16.833 --> 03:19.166
Hey, what’s this light?

03:19.166 --> 03:21.625
To be honest,
we’re not certain.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.750
I was using
Cerebro to attempt
a comprehensive scan

03:24.750 --> 03:28.208
in hopes of uncovering some
disturbance, some sign of...

03:28.208 --> 03:30.000
Of the Professor?
You found him?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.625
No. But we have
found something else.

03:33.625 --> 03:38.083
JEAN: There seems to be
a tearing in the psychic or
astral plane of the planet.

03:38.083 --> 03:42.583
My guess, and that’s
all it is, is that our
friend Bishop’s time travel

03:42.583 --> 03:46.000
may have had far greater
consequences than we
imagined.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.416
According
to Cerebro’s
calculations,

03:48.416 --> 03:52.375
this tear
seems to be shrinking
as though healing itself.

03:52.375 --> 03:56.000
But its location is...
No! Mjnari!

03:58.000 --> 03:59.291
We must warn the village.

You’re looking for someone,

04:38.708 --> 04:40.625
but you don’t know
what he looks like

04:40.625 --> 04:45.000
’cause he can
look like anybody.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.291
He’s not one of
them mutants, is he?
People here don’t like...

04:49.291 --> 04:52.458
Hey, Montgomery!
He never done that before.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.875
Any stranger who comes
this far upriver,
I’d remember,

04:57.875 --> 04:59.458
whatever they looked like.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.583
(SNIFFS)

05:00.583 --> 05:01.500
Morph was here.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.208
Well, I’ll be...

05:18.875 --> 05:22.583
ROGUE: Jean gets that weird
astral plane reading from
this part of Africa.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.000
And my village
calls with an emergency.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.750
ROGUE: You don’t have
to be a rocket scientist

05:26.750 --> 05:28.083
to figure out
there’s a connection.

06:01.958 --> 06:04.583
Storm,
it is good
you have come.

06:04.583 --> 06:07.083
I can’t believe it!

06:07.083 --> 06:10.500
These folks tell me there’s
a kid with an attitude
causing all this mess.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.083
Shani,
what is happening here?

06:13.083 --> 06:15.250
It is Mjnari.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.958
No!

06:16.958 --> 06:19.708
Okay, show us where this
Mjnari character’s at,

06:19.708 --> 06:22.583
and Storm and I’ll go put
a little fear of Storm
into him,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.125
teach him
some manners.

06:24.125 --> 06:28.750
No, wait!
This boy is my son.

06:32.583 --> 06:37.291

as I planned.

You’re coming with me.

07:15.125 --> 07:19.208
I don’t think so, old man.
I figured you might
follow me.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.416
You never
were very bright.

07:21.416 --> 07:23.958

you’re going through,

Why?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.875
So we can go bowling?

07:44.875 --> 07:46.625
Shoot some hoops?

07:46.625 --> 07:49.458
Or maybe it’s love
you’re missing.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.875
I gave birth
to Mjnari,

08:24.875 --> 08:28.291
but Storm is the one
who breathed life
into him.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.083
The birth was difficult.

08:32.083 --> 08:34.416
The midwife helped me
survive it,

08:34.416 --> 08:36.833
but the baby
was not breathing.

08:46.708 --> 08:50.250
I did what I could,
and I was fortunate.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.958
He lived.

08:51.958 --> 08:55.583
During my recovery,
Storm cared for Mjnari.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.875
Storm had
arrived in our
village as an orphan.

08:58.875 --> 09:02.833
She left as one of us,
and second mother to
my son.

09:02.833 --> 09:06.000

developed special
skills,

09:07.333 --> 09:08.458
like you, Storm.

09:10.208 --> 09:14.000
But yesterday, something
terrible happened to him.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.250
He changed.

09:16.250 --> 09:19.125
That’s when Jean says
the astral plane tore open
somewhere around here.

to my son?

But Professor Xavier
sent him spinning
out into...

09:30.166 --> 09:31.833
The astral plane.

09:31.833 --> 09:36.125
Leave the boy alone.
It is I you want.

you on the mountain.

could barely handle
this guy!

09:51.083 --> 09:52.583
Let me come along
and we...

09:52.583 --> 09:55.458
Could harm Mjnari.
I cannot allow that.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.208
And the Shadow King
could harm you.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.083
Don’t suppose I’m
about to allow that!

10:08.458 --> 10:10.583
What took you so long,
my dear?

10:10.583 --> 10:14.625

we might reminisce
about old times together.

from the living death

need some assistance

as my host body,

10:45.375 --> 10:47.583
with all your
delicious powers,

10:47.583 --> 10:49.708
and I shall free the boy.

If you leave
the boy unharmed!

I’m in control!

15:18.208 --> 15:20.958
STORM: I may not
be able to stop you,

15:20.958 --> 15:26.583
but I can destroy you
by destroying us!

15:26.583 --> 15:29.750
Storm! Storm!
You can’t take
him any higher!

15:29.750 --> 15:31.833
There ain’t enough air!

15:31.833 --> 15:34.166
STORM: I must do this, Rogue!

15:34.166 --> 15:35.375
Storm!

15:35.375 --> 15:37.875
Storm! Don’t do it!

15:37.875 --> 15:39.583
(SHADOW KING GASPING)

15:39.583 --> 15:41.000
SHADOW KING: Cannot breathe.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.333
Storm...

15:55.708 --> 15:56.875
ROGUE: Gotcha.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.625
MJNARI: Storm!

16:02.250 --> 16:03.416
STORM: Mjnari!

16:04.583 --> 16:06.458
Mother,
are you all right?

16:07.708 --> 16:12.416
Mjnari, listen to me.
Run!

16:12.416 --> 16:16.291
Go now!
Rogue and I shall
battle the Shadow King.

16:16.291 --> 16:19.291
No, I cannot leave you!

16:19.291 --> 16:22.291
You have to, darling!
If the Shadow King
gets you again,

16:22.291 --> 16:24.583
he’ll force Storm
to do whatever
he wants!

16:24.583 --> 16:26.333
Not if I stop him first!

16:26.333 --> 16:28.750
Kid, I know you’re fast,
but how do you plan to...

16:28.750 --> 16:29.958
MJNARI: The mountain!

16:29.958 --> 16:31.416
What about it?

16:31.416 --> 16:34.166
That is where
the monster came from!

16:34.166 --> 16:39.000
It is a small cave now,
but yesterday the opening
was as big as the mountain!

16:39.000 --> 16:42.375
No, sugar,
he came from the
astral plane somewhere...

16:42.375 --> 16:45.291
The astral
plane opening!
It’s in the mountain!

16:45.291 --> 16:48.500
And Mjnari can see it.

16:48.500 --> 16:54.458
We must drive the Shadow King
back into the astral plane
before it reseals itself!

16:54.458 --> 16:57.708
He’s not gonna go peaceful,
and we don’t even know
where he is!

16:57.708 --> 16:59.000
But I do.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.708
Mjnari, no!

17:01.708 --> 17:05.833
For refusing me,
I shall make you suffer!

17:10.458 --> 17:12.458
Here! Over here!

17:14.750 --> 17:17.416
All of nature,
I command you,

17:17.416 --> 17:21.208
bring forth
thunder and
lightning!

17:21.208 --> 17:23.375
MJNARI: Come on,
you coward! Come on!

17:26.083 --> 17:27.875
(SHADOW KING LAUGHING)

17:43.625 --> 17:47.291
STORM: We must drive
the Shadow King back
into the astral plane

17:47.291 --> 17:49.166
before it
reseals itself...

17:49.166 --> 17:53.000
Reseals itself...
Reseals itself...

18:00.166 --> 18:02.708
And you are mine!

18:02.708 --> 18:06.458
STORM: We must drive
the Shadow King back
into the astral plane

18:06.458 --> 18:08.333
before it reseals itself...

18:08.333 --> 18:11.375
Reseals itself...
Reseals itself...

18:11.375 --> 18:14.708
Mjnari! Mjnari!

18:14.708 --> 18:17.125
If that opening’s here,
we’ll find it!

18:19.125 --> 18:21.125
STORM: Mjnari!

18:21.125 --> 18:22.875
(SHADOW KING ROARING)

18:27.458 --> 18:31.500
Mjnari! Rogue, over here!
I have him!

18:31.500 --> 18:33.625
Come to me, my son!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.500
(SHADOW KING ROARING)

18:50.291 --> 18:51.500
You are safe!

18:53.958 --> 18:55.708
You got a heck of
a son there, Storm.

18:55.708 --> 18:57.125
I know.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.583
You think there’s
any word from Xavier?

18:59.583 --> 19:01.958
That, I do not know.

19:01.958 --> 19:05.625
But I do know
that his thoughts
were with us today.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.625
Magneto?
Are you all right?

19:15.625 --> 19:17.458
I am unharmed, Charles.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.500
What is this place?
A rainforest in
Antarctica?

19:28.166 --> 19:30.291
Am I dreaming?

19:30.291 --> 19:34.625
MAGNETO: No, Charles,
it is real. It’s called
the Savage Land,

19:34.625 --> 19:37.416
a valley, hidden
in perpetual mist,

19:37.416 --> 19:40.625
created eons ago for
a purpose long forgotten.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.833
My legs!

19:46.333 --> 19:49.625
Strange.
What would
restore your...

19:50.875 --> 19:53.500
My powers!
They’re gone!

19:54.875 --> 19:56.875
As are mine!

19:56.875 --> 19:58.333
You seem to
know this place.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.000
I thought I did.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.125
But nothing about it
ever affected
mutant power before.

20:07.708 --> 20:11.458
Perhaps,
whoever lured us here
is responsible...

20:11.458 --> 20:13.708
(PTERODACTYL SCREECHING)

20:20.208 --> 20:21.583
XAVIER: Let him go!

20:23.708 --> 20:24.625
Magneto!

20:32.625 --> 20:34.458
Hold on! I’m coming!

20:37.833 --> 20:41.125
Keep your head up.
We’re going to make it.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.583
(BOTH SCREAMING)
