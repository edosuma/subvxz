WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:05.506
(slurps) OOH.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.041
HEY, HONEY.

00:07.075 --> 00:10.044
HEY, THE MIKE BAXTER SECRET
CHILI RECIPE'S ALMOST READY.

00:10.078 --> 00:13.013
OH, J--NOT YOUR CHILI.
COME ON, MIKE.

00:13.047 --> 00:16.917
GOD, IT'S WINTER.
WE'RE ALL TRAPPED IN HERE.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.353
COUPLE BOWLS OF THIS,
I'LL BE DEFINITELY VIOLATING

00:19.387 --> 00:22.256
OBAMA'S EMISSION STANDARDS.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.058
HEY!

00:24.092 --> 00:25.259
HEY!

00:25.293 --> 00:27.228
SO, RYAN'S GOT SOME
GOOD NEWS.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.697
I FINALLY GOT MY COMMERCIAL
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.332
OH, WOW.
CONGRATULATIONS, RYAN.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.167
YEAH. LAST TIME YOU GOT
A DRIVER'S LICENSE,

00:33.201 --> 00:34.835
YOU CELEBRATED BY--
OH, THAT'S RIGHT--

00:34.868 --> 00:36.670
KNOCKING UP OUR DAUGHTER.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.107
DAD, COME ON. REALLY?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.774
OKAY, OKAY.
COMMERCIAL LICENSE.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.111
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.579
THANK YOU. BUT THERE'S
EVEN BETTER NEWS THAN THAT.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.248
I GOT A JOB
DRIVING A BEER TRUCK.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.250
I LIKE BEER.
(Mike laughs)

00:49.283 --> 00:53.287
YEAH... (laughing)
YEAH. WHAT?

00:53.321 --> 00:56.390
HIS MOUTH WAS ON FIRE
WHEN HE TASTED THE CHILI.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.126
AND HE'S A LOT MORE
FUN WHEN HE'S LOADED,

00:58.159 --> 00:59.560
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.231
RYAN'S BEEN WORKING
TOWARD THIS JOB FOR MONTHS.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.798
IT MEANS HE'LL BE ABLE TO KICK
IN SOME MORE MONEY FOR BOYD.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.468
AND EVERY SPARE DOLLAR'S GOING
TO HELP RAISE MY SON.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.137
YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOOD
ENOUGH FOR YOUR DAUGHTER...

01:09.170 --> 01:11.205
ROGER THAT.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.441
BUT I PROMISE I'M GONNA
DO MY BEST

01:13.474 --> 01:15.276
TO BE GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR GRANDSON.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.317
MOM? ARE YOU OKAY?

01:23.351 --> 01:24.718
YEAH, JUST...

01:24.752 --> 01:26.320
(voice breaking) YOU KNOW,
THE KID'S TRYING SO HARD.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.222
(Mike) IT'S A STRATEGY.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.657
HE LOWERS OUR EXPECTATIONS
BY NOT BEING AROUND

01:29.690 --> 01:31.225
FOR THREE YEARS,
THEN HE SHOWS UP

01:31.259 --> 01:33.294
WITH A TACO AND A PAIR
OF TENNIS SHOES, HE'S A HERO?

01:33.327 --> 01:34.962
THIS KID'S GENIUS.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.464
COME ON. GIVE THE GUY
A LITTLE CREDIT.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.132
HOW ABOUT ME GETTING
A LITTLE CREDIT?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.567
I'VE BEEN SUPPORTING THIS
FAMILY SINCE THE BEGINNING.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.402
HOW ABOUT SHEDDING A TEAR
FOR ME?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.970
YEAH, WE'LL ALL BE
SHEDDING TEARS

01:43.003 --> 01:45.306
ONCE YOU HAVE A BOWL
OF THAT CHILI.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.074
OH... MY... GOD!

01:47.107 --> 01:49.310
BEST DAY EVER!

01:49.343 --> 01:51.245
(panting) I LOVE LIFE!

01:51.279 --> 01:53.914
SOMEBODY'S EXCITED
IT'S CHILI NIGHT.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.618
(laughing) OKAY, SO,
JUST TO SUM UP MY LIFE SO FAR,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.420
I'VE HAD DETENTION...
CHECK.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.522
AND I'VE FAILED CLASSES...
CHECK.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.657
AND I'VE HAD
AN AT-FAULT CAR ACCIDENT.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.427
HA HA.
CHECK WITH A LOT OF ZEROES.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.763
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN SUSPENDED.
NOT EVEN ONCE, HUH?

02:09.797 --> 02:11.499
OH, BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.868
HEY, EVE, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
HUH?

02:14.902 --> 02:17.037
MOM, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.341
EVE GOT SUSPENDED!
(slaps table)

02:20.374 --> 02:22.142
OH, THAT FELT GOOD!
(laughs)

02:22.176 --> 02:25.012
(exhales)
NOT THE GOOD DAUGHTER.

02:28.516 --> 02:31.285
THE ONE I LIKE, YOU KNOW...

02:31.319 --> 02:33.053
(stammering)

02:33.086 --> 02:37.658
THE--THE SAME AS A--
UH, YOU... TWO.

02:37.691 --> 02:41.662
-- Captions by VITA --

02:44.898 --> 02:47.134
YOU WERE SUSPENDED
FOR BULLYING?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.669
EVE, WHAT THE HELL?

02:48.702 --> 02:50.571
A TEACHER REPORTED ME
FOR CALLING

02:50.604 --> 02:53.407
JAY BRINKERHOFF
"GAY BRINKERHOFF."

02:53.441 --> 02:55.909
(laughs)
MIKE.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.246
(laughing) COME ON!
THAT'S FUNNY.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.880
I MEAN, I WOULD HAVE--
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GONE

02:59.913 --> 03:02.350
WITH THE LAST NAME--
"JAY STINKERHOFF."

03:02.383 --> 03:04.418
BUT YOU CAN, YOU KNOW,
PUT THAT IN YOUR, UH,

03:04.452 --> 03:07.087
BACK POCKET IF YOU NEED--
YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED IT.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.722
SO YOU CALLED THIS BOY GAY?

03:08.756 --> 03:09.823
THAT'S ALL YOU DID?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.225
THAT'S PLENTY, DAD.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.426
WHERE'S THE BULLYING PART
OF THAT?

03:12.460 --> 03:13.927
I MEAN, WHERE--DID YOU
SHOVE HIM IN A LOCKER

03:13.961 --> 03:16.430
OR TAKE HIS LUNCH MONEY?
NO.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.198
GAVE HIM AN ATOMIC WEDGIE,
WET WILLIE,

03:18.232 --> 03:20.268
YOU KNOW, PURPLE NURPLE,
WHATEVER?

03:20.301 --> 03:23.271
DAD, CALLING SOMEONE GAY
IS BULLYING.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.772
IT'S VERBAL BIGOTRY.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.007
WORDS CAN BE JUST AS DAMAGING
AS WEAPONS.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.110
NOT IF YOU BUY YOUR WEAPONS
AT MY STORE.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.880
EVE, IS THIS BOY GAY?
NO.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.848
WELL, FOR CRAP'S SAKE.
HE'S NOT EVEN GAY.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.285
THAT'S LIKE CALLING
A TALL PERSON "SHORTY."

03:37.318 --> 03:40.120
SO, IN YOUR ANALOGY, DAD,
GAY IS SHORT?

03:40.153 --> 03:41.289
WHY WOULDN'T GAY BE TALL?

03:41.322 --> 03:43.891
YEAH, DAD. RuPAUL IS,
LIKE, 6'5".

03:43.924 --> 03:47.428
ALTHOUGH... TECHNICALLY,
I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S GAY.

03:47.461 --> 03:50.364
BECAUSE IF HE
IDENTIFIES AS A SHE,

03:50.398 --> 03:54.602
THEN HE WOULDN'T BE GAY
IF SHE'S WITH A MAN.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.538
SO...
WELL, LET'S JUST KEEP
PAINTING THAT PICTURE.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.608
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE SCHOOL
OVERREACTED,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.209
BUT, EVIE, HONEY,
THIS IS WAY OUT OF LINE.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.811
(sighs) I WAS JOKING AROUND.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.446
KIDS IN MY CLASS SAY
"GAY" ALL THE TIME.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.548
THAT'S RIGHT. WHY ISN'T CALLING
SOMEONE GAY A "COMPLIMENT"?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.116
MAYBE SHE SAID IT
IN A HURTFUL WAY.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.051
SHE SAID SHE WAS
JOKING AROUND, YOU KNOW?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.986
I'M GONNA GO WITH EVE ON THIS,
NOT THE THOUGHT POLICE.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.589
YOU KNOW, IN THE 1890s,
IT WAS CALLED "THE GAY '90s."

04:15.623 --> 04:17.090
NO ONE
BITCHED ABOUT IT THEN.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.626
THEY DID ALL THE DANCING
AND STUFF,

04:18.659 --> 04:20.728
THEY DID,
"WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!"

04:20.761 --> 04:23.163
DOING ALL THAT, YOU KNOW?

04:23.196 --> 04:25.433
TH--OHH!

04:25.466 --> 04:27.067
YOU'RE ALL THINKING
SOMETHING ABOUT ME

04:27.100 --> 04:29.002
BECAUSE OF THE WAY I DANCE.
I CAN SEE THAT.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.305
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SCURRY
INTO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE,

04:31.339 --> 04:33.341
START CRYING ABOUT IT.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.976
YEAH... ABOUT THAT,
ONE OF YOU HAS TO GO DOWN

04:36.009 --> 04:37.945
AND TALK TO MR. BAGNATO.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.246
AND I'D LOVE TO BE THAT ONE.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.614
I'LL TAKE THE BILL OF RIGHTS
WITH ME.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.416
APPARENTLY HE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.117
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T
NEED YOU DANCING DOWN THERE.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.953
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE, HONEY.
(mouths words)

04:45.986 --> 04:48.656
SO, YOU GUYS, GIVEN
THAT KRISTIN GOT PREGNANT

04:48.689 --> 04:51.759
AND NOW PERFECT EVE
HAS COMMITTED A HATE CRIME,

04:51.792 --> 04:53.494
UM... (clicks tongue)

04:53.527 --> 04:55.829
ISN'T IT TIME TO RETHINK
MANDY'S PLACE

04:55.863 --> 04:57.631
ON THE BAXTER DAUGHTER PODIUM?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.633
WE DON'T RANK OUR CHILDREN.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.370
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU. OKAY.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.638
THIS IS ONE.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.675
TEEN PREGGERS, TWO.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.877
AND BIGOT GETS THE BRONZE!

05:09.910 --> 05:11.645
(laughs)

05:14.815 --> 05:17.017
HI. MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR "OUTDOOR MAN."

05:17.050 --> 05:18.619
NICE BOAT, HUH?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.220
I KNOW MOST OF YOU
ARE SAYING,

05:20.253 --> 05:21.955
"MIKE, I DON'T NEED
A NEW BOAT.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.491
"I'LL JUST TAKE
THAT GIMBAL HOUSING

05:23.524 --> 05:24.558
"OFF THE ROTTEN TRANSOM

05:24.592 --> 05:26.394
AND JERRY-RIG SOMETHING
MYSELF."

05:26.427 --> 05:28.562
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
SAY "JERRY-RIG."

05:28.596 --> 05:30.731
IT'S DEFAMATORY TO GERMANS.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.468
BEING A GERMAN-AMERICAN,
I DON'T THINK I LIKE IT.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.203
I'M KIDDING. I DON'T CARE
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.638
IT'S NOT WORLD WAR II.
COME ON.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.574
WHEN DID WE BECOME
SO SENSITIVE ABOUT WORDS?

05:40.608 --> 05:42.042
IT'S ABOUT INTENT.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.511
OUR WORDS ARE CRIPPLING US.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.414
OR SHOULD I SAY,
"DISABLING US"?

05:46.447 --> 05:48.416
I THINK WE FORGOT
THAT STICKS AND STONES

05:48.449 --> 05:50.183
ACTUALLY DO HURT.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.386
I THINK IF WE GOT PELTED
IN THE BACK OF THE NECK

05:52.420 --> 05:53.987
WITH A ROCK EVERY DAY,
IT WOULD TAKE

05:54.021 --> 05:57.825
A LITTLE OF THE STING OUT
OF BEING CALLED A "FAT-ASS."

05:57.858 --> 06:02.162
SO WHAT AM I GONNA DO ABOUT IT?
I'M JUST A RETAILER.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.031
I'M GONNA HAVE A SALE.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.566
I'M GONNA SELL
NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES,

06:05.599 --> 06:08.769
NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT,
NYLON ANGLING SHIRTS.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.672
EVERYTHING IN THE STORE THAT
BEGINS WITH THE LETTER "N."

06:11.705 --> 06:13.073
WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE SALE.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.176
WE'LL CALL IT THE...
"M"-WORD SALE.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.045
'CAUSE IF I WENT
WITH THE OTHER LETTER,

06:18.078 --> 06:20.814
YOU'D CALL ME A RACIST.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.585
WOW. THAT WAS
REALLY SOMETHING, SIR.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.286
YOU LIKE THAT?

06:26.319 --> 06:28.556
NO, YOU SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.758
COME ON, NANCY,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

06:30.791 --> 06:33.427
IT'S JUST THAT WORDS
CAN BE VERY HURTFUL.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.596
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A SISSY.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.230
HURTFUL.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.632
I'M JOKING, I'M JOKING.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.267
NO, MIKE, WHAT'S GOT YOU
ALL RILED UP TODAY?

06:40.300 --> 06:43.737
EVE GOT SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL
FOR CALLING SOMEBODY GAY.

06:43.771 --> 06:47.107
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.077
WHEN IN DOUBT,
SAY "L.G.B.T."

06:50.110 --> 06:52.713
SOUNDS LIKE
A DELICIOUS SANDWICH.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.449
I MEAN... (stammers)
BUT I DON'T GET IT.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.417
THEY CALLED THE 1890s
"THE GAY '90s,"

06:57.451 --> 06:59.653
BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS HAVING
A GOOD TIME!

06:59.687 --> 07:02.122
YEAH, YEAH!
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID!
SEE?

07:02.155 --> 07:04.892
ALTHOUGH UNLIKE YOU,
I DIDN'T LIVE THROUGH THEM.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.628
YOU KNOW... (laughing)
OH...

07:13.701 --> 07:14.668
HEY.
(Kristen) HEY.

07:14.702 --> 07:15.669
HI.
HEY.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.338
MOMMY!
HEY, KIDDO! OHH!

07:18.371 --> 07:22.510
AUNT MANDY PUTS ON LIPSTICK
WHEN SHE DRIVES!

07:22.543 --> 07:25.846
DON'T WORRY. (chuckles)
I STEER WITH MY KNEES.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.616
THANKS FOR BRINGING BOYD
HOME FROM RYAN'S.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.651
OH, NO PROBLEM.
IT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY

07:30.684 --> 07:33.120
FOR BEING THE FAVORITE DAUGHTER.
(giggles)

07:33.153 --> 07:35.422
IT'S THE BURDEN OF BEING
ON TOP.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.492
THAT'S WHERE YOU WERE
RIGHT BEFORE YOU GOT PREGNANT.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.661
WELL, YOU REALLY HELPED
RYAN OUT.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.796
HE'S GOT A BIG HAUL
DOWN TO DURANGO TONIGHT.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.798
WOW. AFTER SPENDING
THE WHOLE DAY

07:44.832 --> 07:47.167
DETAILING HIS MOTORCYCLE.
(sighs)

07:47.200 --> 07:48.702
HE BOUGHT A MOTORCYCLE?

07:48.736 --> 07:51.705
DUDE, RYAN IS SERIOUSLY
BORDERING ON SEXY. (laughs)

07:51.739 --> 07:53.674
BY NIGHT DRIVING
HIS BEER TRUCK,

07:53.707 --> 07:55.643
BY DAY WAXING HIS HOG.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.611
WHAT?

07:57.645 --> 07:59.713
HOW CAN HE SPEND MONEY
ON A MOTORCYCLE?

07:59.747 --> 08:01.615
IS IT BAD THAT SOMETIMES
I DAYDREAM

08:01.649 --> 08:04.451
ABOUT HAULING OFF AND HITTING
HIM WITH A CLOSED FIST?!

08:04.484 --> 08:06.219
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. WHO ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HITTING?

08:06.253 --> 08:07.454
RYAN.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.889
OH. NO NEED TO HIT HIM.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.726
JUST GO LIKE THIS.
HE'LL PROBABLY FAINT.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.295
RYAN BOUGHT A MOTORCYCLE.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.697
REALLY?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.632
YEAH. HE HASN'T PAID
A DIME TOWARD BOYD YET,

08:18.666 --> 08:19.700
HE'S ALREADY BOUGHT HIMSELF
A TOY.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.735
MOTORCYCLES AREN'T TOYS.

08:21.769 --> 08:26.540
IT'S ALL THE POWER OF A CAR,
AND NONE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.743
WELL, WHAT KIND?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.411
IT'S BLUE.
OH!

08:32.680 --> 08:35.649
WHY, NOTHING GETS BY YOU,
DOES IT, MANDY?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.685
IT'S COMPLETELY
IRRESPONSIBLE.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.020
IT MIGHT MAKE HIM
MORE OF A DUDE. I LIKE IT.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.689
WELL, WHAT--WHAT IF HE JUST
ENDS UP SPLATTERED

08:41.722 --> 08:42.923
OUT ON COLORADO BOULEVARD?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.725
WIN/WIN.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.696
OH, HEY, SWEETIE.
HI, BABE.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.497
LISTEN,
I HAD A BIG SIT-DOWN

08:50.530 --> 08:52.065
WITH PRINCIPAL BAGNATO
ABOUT EVE.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.934
(wiseguy accent) OH, YEAH?
"I HAD A BIG SIT-DOWN

08:53.967 --> 08:56.570
WITH BAGNATO ABOUT EVE."

08:56.604 --> 09:01.374
WHAT ARE WE GONNA FIND,
A HORSE HEAD IN HER BED?

09:01.408 --> 09:02.776
OKAY. COME ON. STOP.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.679
THE SCHOOL
HAS THESE GUIDELINES

09:05.713 --> 09:07.781
TO HELP TEACH KIDS
HOW TO BE MORE SENSITIVE.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.449
THEY'RE CALLED "COOL TOOLS."

09:09.482 --> 09:10.851
(normal voice)
WAIT, LOOK AT THIS.
YEAH, YEAH.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.454
"RED WORDS," "GREEN WORDS,"
"NICE WORDS," "MEAN WORDS."

09:14.487 --> 09:16.389
WHO WROTE THIS--DR. SEUSS?

09:16.423 --> 09:18.125
(speaks indistinctly)

09:18.158 --> 09:19.860
HEY, MOM.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.461
RUN, QUICKLY!
GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!
HEY, NO--SHH!

09:21.494 --> 09:22.696
(Mike) OH.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.797
HONEY, COME HERE,
COME HERE.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.365
UH, LISTEN.
I HAD A GOOD TALK

09:25.398 --> 09:26.600
WITH YOUR PRINCIPAL TODAY.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.870
HMM. REALLY? WITH HIM
OR HIS HAND PUPPETS?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.739
(laughs)

09:31.772 --> 09:33.774
WELL, IT'S... YOU KNOW.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.076
EVE, HE, UH, HE GAVE ME
THIS WORKBOOK

09:36.109 --> 09:37.477
TO GIVE TO YOU.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.715
HONEY, YOU KNOW,
WORDS ARE LIKE TOOTHPASTE.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.817
(groans) OH, BOY.
(groans) OH, BOY.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.955
ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE TUBE,
YOU CAN'T PUT THEM BACK IN.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.890
(clicks tongue)

09:49.923 --> 09:51.458
WELL, THANKS, MOM.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.426
YOU'VE REALLY OPENED MY MIND
ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.228
WAIT A MINUTE--
S-SIT BACK DOWN.
LET HER FINISH.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.463
HONEY...
LET HER FINISH THIS.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.265
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, BE NICE.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.600
I-IT'S SIMPLE. THINK BEFORE
YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH,

10:00.634 --> 10:02.402
AND IF IT'S GONNA HURT SOMEBODY,
DON'T SAY IT.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.905
AND WHEN YOU USE A WORD
LIKE "GAY" THE WAY YOU DID,

10:04.938 --> 10:06.974
YOU COULD BE TAKING AWAY
SOMEBODY'S DIGNITY.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.176
MOM, YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING AGAINST GAY PEOPLE.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.444
JAY BRINKERHOFF'S NAME
JUST RHYMES WITH "GAY."

10:11.478 --> 10:14.247
YEAH, IF HIS NAME HAPPENED
TO BE, UH, UH, "TUCKER,"

10:14.281 --> 10:16.850
IT WOULD BE
A DIFFERENT STORY, RIGHT?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.285
MIKE.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.187
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING,
SHE COULD HAVE...

10:20.220 --> 10:21.454
(speaks indistinctly)

10:21.488 --> 10:23.123
OKAY. THE PRINCIPAL
WANTS YOU TO DO

10:23.156 --> 10:25.793
ALL THE EXERCISES
IN THE "COOL TOOL" WORKBOOK.
OKAY.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.662
FIRST EXERCISE--FORGET
THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.332
I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU
UNDERMINING ME LIKE THAT.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.834
HONEY,
I'M NOT UNDERMINING YOU.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.435
I JUST DISAGREE WITH
EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.871
HONEY, SHE'S NOT TAKING ME
SERIOUSLY

10:37.905 --> 10:39.940
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.710
WHERE DO YOU THINK SHE GETS
ALL THIS WISE-ASS STUFF FROM?

10:42.743 --> 10:45.813
HOPEFULLY FROM ME,
BECAUSE YOU'RE HORRIBLE AT IT.
OH...

10:45.846 --> 10:48.015
- LOOK, HONEY,
THIS IS SERIOUS.
- I KNOW.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.650
50% OF ALL TEENAGERS
HAVE BEEN BULLIED.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.219
WHICH MEANS 50%
ARE THE BULLIES,

10:52.252 --> 10:54.855
AND WHICH TEAM
DO YOU WANT HER ON?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.656
I WOULD RATHER SHE NOT BE
SOMEBODY WHO ENJOYS

10:56.690 --> 10:58.158
HURTING
OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.493
I GET IT. SO WHAT DO
YOU WANT ME TO DO?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.329
I WANT YOU TO COME IN THERE
WITH ME, UNITED FRONT,

11:02.362 --> 11:04.865
AND HELP HER UNDERSTAND
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.999
(sighs)

11:08.668 --> 11:11.004
HEY, D-BAGS.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.243
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN VERY FAR.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.179
SO NOT FUNNY.
OKAY, LISTEN.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.815
WE WANT YOU TO FINISH
THE "COOL TOOLS" WORKBOOK.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.717
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
PLAY AGAINST LINCOLN

11:23.751 --> 11:24.918
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.253
BUT IF I DON'T PLAY,
YOU WON'T GO,

11:26.286 --> 11:28.756
AND WHO WILL YELL
AT THE REFS?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.223
WE'RE SERIOUS, EVE.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.825
THIS IS SO UNFAIR. YOU KNOW WHO
SHOULD BE DOING THIS WORKBOOK?

11:31.859 --> 11:34.361
JAY BRINKERHOFF.
HE STARTED THE WHOLE THING.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.896
WHY? WHAT DID JAY DO?

11:35.929 --> 11:36.930
HIS NAME RHYMES WITH "GAY."

11:36.964 --> 11:38.832
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN KEEPING UP
WITH THIS THING?

11:38.866 --> 11:41.769
OKAY, SO WE WERE PLAYING
BASKETBALL ONE-ON-ONE,

11:41.802 --> 11:44.337
AND I TORCHED HIM,

11:44.371 --> 11:47.207
SO I DID MY TRADEMARK
"SUCK-IT" DANCE,

11:47.240 --> 11:48.909
AND THEN HE CALLED ME
A MEAN NAME

11:48.942 --> 11:50.677
THAT RHYMES WITH "BIKE."

11:50.710 --> 11:52.746
OH, BOY.

11:52.780 --> 11:56.549
SO THEN HE AND HIS FRIENDS
CALLED ME "STEVE BAXTER."
MM.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.119
SO--SO I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
SO THIS IS SELF-DEFENSE.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.954
YES.
WAIT. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GO
TO THE PRINCIPAL

12:00.988 --> 12:02.689
AND TELL THEM THAT JAY
WAS TEASING YOU?

12:02.722 --> 12:03.924
BECAUSE IT WAS NOTHING.
IT'S STUPID.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.759
THE WHOLE THING IS STUPID.
I HAVE TO DO THIS WORKBOOK.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.527
NO, IT'S NOT STUPID. EVE.
HEY, BABY--DON'T--

12:07.560 --> 12:09.562
SHE'S FINE.
SHE DIDN'T BULLY ANYBODY.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.964
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.933
(wiseguy accent) SHE TOOK
HER FIRST PINCH LIKE A MAN.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.969
SHE DIDN'T TURN ON NOBODY.
SHE TOLD NOBODY ABOUT IT.

12:16.003 --> 12:19.973
WHAT ARE YOU DO--WHAT IS IT,
MAFIA WEEK ON AMC?

12:20.007 --> 12:24.311
I'M JUST SAYING
FUHGEDDABOUDIT!

12:24.344 --> 12:26.746
I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.783
THIS IS DAVE WILSON
AND ANDY GREEN ALL OVER AGAIN.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.786
YEAH, OF COURSE, IT'S
THE FAMOUS WILSON-GREEN AFFAIR.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.221
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.956
THEY WERE THE TWO GUYS
THAT WERE TORMENTING ME

12:35.989 --> 12:38.926
WHEN I WAS EVE'S AGE,
BUT I ONLY TOLD ON DAVE WILSON.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.593
WHY DID YOU RAT ON WILSON?

12:40.627 --> 12:42.963
BECAUSE I LIKED ANDY GREEN.
OH, STOP IT. STOP IT.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.497
NOW THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENED
WITH EVE.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.166
SHE LIKES
THIS GAY BRINKERHOFF.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.835
JAY.
JAY! JAY!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.970
(speaks indistinctly)

12:50.003 --> 12:52.572
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.
NO SENSE OF HUMOR,

12:52.605 --> 12:54.507
A CRYBABY, NOT ATHLETIC.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.810
PERFECT
BAXTER BOYFRIEND MATERIAL.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.312
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE LIKES HIM.
THAT'S WHY SHE'S SO UPSET.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.848
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S THAT UPSET.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.615
EVEN IF SHE IS,
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.852
SHE'S TOUGH. YOU'RE NOT STILL
PINING FOR THAT GUY, ARE YOU?
NO.

13:04.885 --> 13:08.822
NO, OF COURSE--I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT BECAME OF HIM.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.490
HE'S NOT ON FACEBOOK.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.030
(mouths words)

13:26.073 --> 13:28.108
(knock on door)

13:28.141 --> 13:34.982
(knocking continues)

13:35.015 --> 13:37.985
HEY, JACKASS. WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

13:38.018 --> 13:42.522
WELL, I WAS THINKING,
"I WONDER WHO'S AT THE DOOR."

13:42.555 --> 13:45.993
AND NOW I'M THINKING,
WHY DID I OPEN THE DOOR?

13:46.026 --> 13:48.395
EVERY TIME I START
TO TRUST YOU,

13:48.428 --> 13:50.130
YOU REMIND ME
THAT YOU'RE A SCREWUP.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.798
UH, A SCREWUP WHO GREW

13:51.831 --> 13:54.902
AN ENTIRE TRAY OF WHEATGRASS
FROM SEEDS.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.404
YEAH, I GREW SOMETHING
FROM ONE OF YOUR SEEDS, TOO.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.039
HE'S 5 NOW.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.475
THIS IS MY FAULT.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.676
IT'S LIKE I'M STILL THAT GIRL
IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO BELIEVED YOU

14:03.710 --> 14:06.079
WHEN YOU SAID,
"I JUST WANNA CUDDLE."

14:06.113 --> 14:09.917
AS I RECALL, I DID
JUST WANNA CUDDLE.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.886
BUT YOU'RE
A REALLY GOOD CUDDLER.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.755
YESTERDAY, YOU SAID YOU
WERE GONNA START CHIPPING IN,

14:15.788 --> 14:18.391
AND I FIND OUT YOU--
YOU BOUGHT A MOTORCYCLE?

14:18.425 --> 14:20.593
MEANWHILE, I'M WORKING
DOUBLE SHIFTS,

14:20.627 --> 14:22.595
NOT WAXING MY HOG...

14:22.629 --> 14:25.032
(clenches teeth) OR ANYTHING
ELSE FOR THAT MATTER.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.234
KRIS, IT'S--
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.002
WHAT'S IT LIKE THEN, RYAN?
HUH?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.504
WHAT IF I SAID THAT
I BOUGHT THE BIKE

14:31.538 --> 14:33.941
SO I COULD SELL MY CAR
AND GIVE YOU THE MONEY?

14:33.974 --> 14:37.877
THAT WOULD BE
EXTREMELY RESPONSIBLE.

14:37.911 --> 14:42.015
AND I WOULD FEEL
REALLY DUMB RIGHT NOW.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.017
SORRY, DUMMY.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.586
AND THERE'S GONNA BE MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.188
WHAT? SOMEBODY PAID YOU
THIS MUCH

14:48.221 --> 14:51.091
FOR THAT PIECE-OF-CRAP CAR?

14:51.124 --> 14:54.261
I HAD TO THROW IN
MY YOGURT MAKER, TOO.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.565
BUT IT'S ALL
FOR YOU AND BOYD.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.634
THANK YOU.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.610
OH, ACTUALLY, UM,
COULD I GET $20 BACK?

15:10.643 --> 15:13.213
I-I'VE GOT A PIZZA COMING.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.982
SURE. GUESS MY WAXING
CAN WAIT.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.750
TALK ABOUT
GROWING WHEATGRASS.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.053
SO WHEN'S YOUR SHIFT START?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.055
YOU--YOU WANNA STAY
FOR SOME PIZZA?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.591
I SHOULD GO.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.159
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE CAN WATCH TV

15:26.193 --> 15:27.794
OR MAYBE CUDDLE?

15:29.796 --> 15:31.498
AS FRIENDS!
(door closes)

15:33.333 --> 15:35.102
WOW.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.608
HURRY UP, EVE! I DON'T WANNA
MISS THE SHOOT-AROUND.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.143
(Eve) COMING!

15:43.176 --> 15:44.511
(door squeaks and closes)

15:44.544 --> 15:46.079
I'M SURPRISED
BAGNATO'S LETTING HER PLAY.

15:46.113 --> 15:49.949
ISN'T HE WORRIED SHE'S GONNA
MAKE THE OTHER TEAM CRY?

15:49.983 --> 15:52.119
OH, YOU KNOW,
I JUST HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.686
I MEAN, WHEN THE FIRST BOY
YOU LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL

15:53.720 --> 15:56.023
MAKES FUN OF YOU,
IT STICKS WITH YOU.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.158
KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.359
WOW, THAT ANDY GREEN
REALLY DID A NUMBER ON YOU.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.827
WHAT DID HE SAY?
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.962
OH, NO. IT'S SO LONG AGO.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.264
COME ON, HONEY. I'M SURE YOU
REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID.
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T--

16:04.297 --> 16:06.133
WHAT DID HE SAY?

16:06.166 --> 16:07.600
* VANESSA, VANESSA

16:07.634 --> 16:09.869
* I'D HATE TO UNDRESS YA

16:09.902 --> 16:12.005
* WHO YOU TRYING
TO IMPRESS-A *

16:12.039 --> 16:14.907
(voice breaking)
* WITH HAIR SUCH A... MESS-A

16:17.577 --> 16:20.047
WOW. THAT'S TERRIBLE.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.482
LISTEN, WHOEVER WROTE
THAT SHOW TUNE...

16:22.515 --> 16:24.817
IS NOT INTO CHICKS.
(sighs)

16:24.851 --> 16:26.786
I DON'T THINK EVE BEING CALLED
A BOY BOTHERED HER AT ALL.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.987
SHE'S LIKE A TANK.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.156
SHE'S LIKE A...

16:32.092 --> 16:36.063
A BEAUTIFUL, FLOWERY,
DELICATE TANK.

16:36.096 --> 16:39.732
UH, SOMEBODY PUT A SUPERMODEL
HEAD ON YOUR POINT GUARD.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.968
STILL THINK BEING CALLED A BOY
DOESN'T BOTHER HER?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.337
THIS COULD BE A COINCIDENCE.
(stammers) IT--IT COULD BE.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.206
AH.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.708
MAYBE IT BOTHERED HER
A LITTLE.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.377
HEY, DAD, LINCOLN'S
SHOOTING GUARD CAN'T GO LEFT.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.744
I'M GONNA HAVE
SO MANY STEALS TONIGHT.

16:51.778 --> 16:55.382
YEAH, GREAT. BRACELETS.

16:55.415 --> 16:58.218
UH...

16:58.251 --> 17:00.520
SO WHAT'S WITH ALL THE--
THE WAR PAINT?

17:00.553 --> 17:01.888
MANDY HELPED ME PUT
MY NEW GAME FACE ON.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.223
AWESOME, HUH?
NICE.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.292
IS THE OTHER ONE STILL
UNDER THERE SOMEWHERE? (laughs)

17:07.294 --> 17:08.428
HONEY, DOES THIS HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

17:08.461 --> 17:10.263
WITH WHAT JAY SAID TO YOU?

17:10.297 --> 17:12.065
BECAUSE I'M JUST NOT SURE
THAT YOUR TEARDROP EARRINGS

17:12.099 --> 17:15.068
ARE GONNA MATCH
YOUR MOUTHGUARD.

17:15.102 --> 17:19.005
I CAN LOOK GOOD
AND STILL KICK ASS.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.941
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
YOU KNOW THIS, RIGHT?

17:21.974 --> 17:26.213
WELL, NO ONE'S GONNA BE
CALLING ME "STEVE" TONIGHT.
NO.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.514
LISTEN, IF I WERE ON THE COURT,
AND WE WERE PLAYING AGAINST YOU,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.048
AND I SAID,
"YOUR JUMP SHOT SUCKED,"

17:29.082 --> 17:30.383
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO ME?

17:30.417 --> 17:32.685
I'D SAY, "GET SOME GLASSES,
OLD MAN."

17:32.719 --> 17:34.087
RIGHT, AND YOU'D SAY THAT

17:34.121 --> 17:37.190
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE
WHAT I SAID.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.126
SO SOMEBODY CALLING YOU "STEVE"

17:39.159 --> 17:43.396
WOULD BE LIKE ME CALLING
YOUR MOM "THUNDER THIGHS."

17:47.800 --> 17:50.970
OR SOMETHING ELSE.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.140
ANYTHING ELSE!

17:53.173 --> 17:56.876
JUST... NOT EVEN
AS AN EXAMPLE.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.113
'CAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.815
I GUESS WHAT JAY SAID TO ME
ONLY BUGGED ME BECAUSE

18:02.849 --> 18:04.584
I THOUGHT HE REALLY
LIKED ME.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.985
WELL, MAYBE HE'S THE ONE
THAT NEEDS GLASSES

18:06.018 --> 18:07.887
'CAUSE HE CAN'T SEE
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.557
THANKS, DAD.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.225
HONEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS?

18:12.259 --> 18:15.262
I-I THINK THAT JAY PROBABLY
REALLY DOES LIKE YOU.
YEAH.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.165
AND SOMETIMES IMMATURE BOYS
EXPRESS THEIR AFFECTION

18:18.198 --> 18:19.666
BY BEING MEAN.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.469
LISTEN TO
OLD THUNDER THIGHS HERE.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.841
DAD, UNH-UNH,
THOSE ARE TOOTHPASTE WORDS.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.877
(wiseguy accent)
THEY DON'T GO BACK IN THE TUBE.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.982
(laughs) ARE YOU--ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE ALL THAT MAKEUP OFF?

18:36.015 --> 18:39.252
UH, I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT ON
FOR TONIGHT'S GAME.
WHY?

18:39.286 --> 18:42.355
'CAUSE... LET 'EM GET A LOAD
OF THIS, THAT'S WHY!
YEAH.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.024
TAKE THIS OUT.
I GOTTA FIND MY KEYS.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.593
SO EVERYBODY LOVES EVE AGAIN?

18:46.626 --> 18:50.163
BACK ON TOP, BABY.
BACK ON TOP.

18:50.197 --> 18:54.367
OH, THANK GOD. IT WAS SO MUCH
PRESSURE BEING YOUR FAVORITE.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.903
OH, AND BY THE WAY, DAD,
I HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.508
TWICE.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.212
(wiseguy voice)
NOBODY CAN HURT YOU LIKE FAMILY.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.720
(Mandy giggling)
(knocks on window)

19:13.753 --> 19:15.188
(singsongy) GUESS WHO GOT
IN TROUBLE AGAIN?

19:15.222 --> 19:17.190
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:17.224 --> 19:19.392
YEP, JAY BRINKERHOFF KISSED HER
AT ASSEMBLY

19:19.426 --> 19:20.560
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.696
I'M SO PROUD.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.298
DO NOT TELL YOUR FATHER.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.900
THEY SAID IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN,
I'D GET SUSPENDED. HMM.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.472
(singsongy) AND IT IS DEFINITELY
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.807
(laughs)

19:34.841 --> 19:36.843
(both squealing)
AH-AH-AH!

19:36.876 --> 19:37.844
(grunts)

19:37.877 --> 19:40.247
(knock on door)
I'LL GET IT.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.581
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, SWEETIE.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.384
HEY, RYAN.
HEY--

19:47.420 --> 19:49.556
HEY, MIKE.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.657
BROUGHT YOU A SIX-PACK.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.058
AH...

19:52.091 --> 19:54.427
WE'LL JUST SAY
IT FELL OFF THE TRUCK.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.396
ACTUALLY, IT DID
FALL OFF THE TRUCK.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.532
YOU MIGHT WANNA OPEN IT
IN THE SINK.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.401
BROUGHT YOUR MOTORCYCLE?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.436
YEAH, YOU WANNA
CHECK IT OUT?
YEAH.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.605
YEAH.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.117
CHECK OUT THE HOG.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.421
THIS ISN'T EVEN A PIGLET.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.291
BUT IT GETS
GREAT GAS MILEAGE.

20:24.324 --> 20:28.261
I BET IT GOES NICE AND SLOW
SO IT WON'T BLOW UP YOUR SKIRT.

20:28.295 --> 20:33.199
AND EVERY PENNY SAVED GOES
TOWARDS BOYD'S COLLEGE FUND.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.967
(voice breaking)
THAT'S SO GREAT, RYAN.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.371
OH, HONEY. THERE'S ONLY ONE
WORD TO DESCRIBE THIS THING.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.640
NOW DON'T SAY IT.
THIS IS SO, SO...

20:40.673 --> 20:42.675
(horn honks)
