00:06.807 --> 00:19.915
Spirituality is a particular term which
actually means: a dealing with intuition.

00:23.925 --> 00:31.354
In the theistic tradition there is
a notion of clinging into a word.

00:33.435 --> 00:41.843
A certain act is regarded as
displeasing to a divine principle...

00:42.444 --> 00:48.281
A certain act is regarded as
pleasing for the divine... whatever.

00:50.119 --> 00:55.044
In the tradition of non-theism,
however, it is very direct...

00:55.079 --> 00:58.653
that the case histories are
not particularly important.

01:00.014 --> 01:04.795
What is actually important
is Here and Now.

01:05.901 --> 01:08.734
Now is definitely now.

01:09.538 --> 01:13.942
We try to experience what is
available there... on the spot.

01:17.214 --> 01:22.982
There is no point in thinking that a
past did exist that we could have now.

01:25.523 --> 01:29.391
This is now.
This very moment.

01:30.628 --> 01:34.325
Nothing mystical, just 'Now',
very simple, straightforward.

01:35.900 --> 01:42.931
And from that Now-ness, however,
arises a sense of intelligence always

01:43.274 --> 01:50.148
that you are constantly
interacting with reality one by one.

01:50.183 --> 01:52.021
Spot by spot.
Constantly.

01:52.650 --> 01:57.884
We actually experience
fantastic precision, always.

02:00.125 --> 02:06.155
But we are threatened by the Now so
we jump to the past or the future.

02:09.269 --> 02:14.927
Paying attention to the materials
that exist in our life...

02:14.962 --> 02:17.219
such rich life that we lead

02:17.743 --> 02:22.146
all these choices take
place all the time...

02:22.214 --> 02:25.412
but none of them are
regarded as bad or good per se.

02:25.985 --> 02:29.793
Everything we experience
are unconditional experiences.

02:29.828 --> 02:33.093
They don't come along
with a label saying

02:33.128 --> 02:35.824
'this is regarded as bad'
or 'this is good'.

02:36.964 --> 02:42.289
But we experience them but we don't
actually pay heed to them properly.

02:42.324 --> 02:46.500
We don't actually regard
that we are going somewhere.

02:46.535 --> 02:47.604
We regard that
as a hassle.

02:48.308 --> 02:55.112
Waiting to be dead.

02:55.182 --> 03:03.521
Waiting to be dead.

03:05.760 --> 03:10.857
That is a problem. That is not
trusting the Now-ness properly;

03:11.566 --> 03:17.664
that what is actually experienced Now
possesses a lot of powerful things.

03:19.408 --> 03:23.673
It is so powerful
that we can't face it.

03:25.524 --> 03:27.407
Therefore,
we have to borrow from the past

03:27.457 --> 03:30.391
and invite the future
all the time.

03:32.153 --> 03:34.987
And maybe that's
why we seek religion.

03:36.292 --> 03:40.353
Maybe that's why
we march in the street.

03:41.197 --> 03:45.293
Maybe that's why
we complain to society.

03:46.168 --> 03:50.629
Maybe that's why
we vote for the presidents.

03:52.609 --> 03:55.009
It is quite ironical...

03:55.512 --> 03:57.412
Very funny indeed.

09:09.873 --> 09:17.015
The more you begin to investigate...
What we think we understand,

09:17.050 --> 09:18.644
where we came from,
what we think we're doing,

09:19.649 --> 09:22.243
the more you begin to see
we've been lied to.

09:23.219 --> 09:26.552
We've been lied to
by every institution.

09:26.587 --> 09:29.425
What makes you think for one minute
that the religious institution

09:29.460 --> 09:33.286
is the only one that's
never been touched?

09:33.321 --> 09:38.795
The religious institutions of this
world are at the bottom of the dirt.

09:39.370 --> 09:45.894
The religious institutions in this
world are put there by the same people

09:45.929 --> 09:48.786
who gave you your government,
your corrupt education,

09:48.821 --> 09:52.500
who set up your
international banking cartels.

09:52.535 --> 09:57.467
Because our masters don't give
a damn about you or your family.

09:57.502 --> 10:01.036
All they care about is what
they have always cared about

10:01.071 --> 10:04.060
and that's controlling
the whole damn world.

10:04.952 --> 10:10.489
We have been misled away from the true
and divine presence in the universe

10:10.524 --> 10:12.224
that men have called God.

10:12.259 --> 10:14.706
I don't know what God is
but I know what he isn't,

10:15.207 --> 10:21.022
and unless and until you are
prepared to look at the whole truth,

10:21.057 --> 10:24.567
and wherever it may go,
whoever it may lead to,

10:24.602 --> 10:28.090
if you want to look the other way
or if you want to play favorites,

10:28.125 --> 10:31.270
then somewhere along the line
you're going to find out

10:31.305 --> 10:33.819
you're messing with
divine justice.

10:34.319 --> 10:38.193
The more you educate yourself, the more
you understand where things come from

10:38.228 --> 10:42.417
the more obvious things become and
you begin to see lies everywhere.

10:42.452 --> 10:46.503
You have to know the truth and seek the
truth and the truth will set you free.

11:40.030 --> 11:43.795
Because I gotta tell you the truth,
folks, I gotta tell you the truth.

11:46.416 --> 11:53.580
When it comes to bullshit,
big-time, major league bullshit,

11:53.615 --> 11:55.844
you have to stand in awe,

11:55.879 --> 11:59.790
of the all-time champion of false
promises and exaggerated claims--

11:59.949 --> 12:01.917
Religion.

12:03.286 --> 12:05.447
Think about it.

12:05.522 --> 12:08.992
Religion has actually
convinced people that

12:08.993 --> 12:13.174
there's an invisible man
living in the sky

12:13.209 --> 12:17.099
who watches everything you do,
every minute of every day.

12:17.134 --> 12:19.332
And the invisible man
has a special list

12:19.367 --> 12:22.096
of ten things he does
not want you to do.

12:23.574 --> 12:28.080
And if you do any of these ten things,
he has a special place, full of fire

12:28.115 --> 12:30.782
and smoke and burning
and torture and anguish,

12:30.817 --> 12:33.309
where he will send you to live
and suffer

12:33.344 --> 12:35.609
and burn and choke
and scream and cry

12:35.644 --> 12:38.214
forever and ever
'til the end of time!

12:40.987 --> 12:43.190
But He loves you.

12:53.937 --> 13:00.377
He loves you, and he needs money!
He always needs money!

13:01.091 --> 13:03.976
He's all-powerful, all-perfect,
all-knowing, and all-wise,

13:04.011 --> 13:06.875
somehow
just can't handle money!

13:08.688 --> 13:14.008
Religion takes in billions of dollars,
they pay no taxes,

13:14.043 --> 13:16.110
and they always need
a little more.

13:16.145 --> 13:22.661
Now, you talk about a good
bullshit story. Holy Shit!

14:02.422 --> 14:04.412
This is the sun.

14:04.513 --> 14:07.356
As far back as 10 thousand B.C.,

14:07.391 --> 14:09.831
history is abundant
with carvings and writings

14:09.832 --> 14:12.681
reflecting peoples respect
and adoration for this object.

14:14.392 --> 14:17.967
And it is simple to understand why
as every morning the sun would rise,

14:18.002 --> 14:21.497
bringing vision, warmth, and security,
saving man from the cold, blind,

14:21.532 --> 14:23.328
predator-filled darkness of night.

14:24.918 --> 14:28.004
Without it, the cultures understood
the crops would not grow,

14:28.039 --> 14:29.935
and life on the planet
would not survive.

14:30.716 --> 14:34.940
These realities made the sun the
most adored object of all time.

14:36.947 --> 14:40.550
Likewise, they were also
very aware of the stars.

14:40.585 --> 14:43.476
The tracking of the stars
allowed them to recognize

14:43.511 --> 14:46.489
and anticipate events which
occurred over long periods of time,

14:46.524 --> 14:48.787
such as eclipses and full moons.

14:49.727 --> 14:51.764
They in turn
catalogued celestial groups

14:51.799 --> 14:54.586
into what we know
today as constellations.

14:57.501 --> 14:59.518
This is the
cross of the Zodiac,

14:59.601 --> 15:02.200
one of the oldest conceptual
images in human history.

15:02.540 --> 15:05.902
It reflects the sun as
it figuratively passes

15:05.937 --> 15:08.509
through the 12 major constellations
over the course of a year.

15:09.894 --> 15:12.382
It also reflects the
12 months of the year,

15:12.468 --> 15:15.954
the 4 seasons,
and the solstices and equinoxes.

15:16.609 --> 15:18.927
The term Zodiac
relates to the fact that

15:18.962 --> 15:24.684
constellations were anthropomorphized,
or personified, as figures, or animals.

15:24.962 --> 15:29.241
In other words, the early civilizations
did not just follow the sun and stars,

15:29.276 --> 15:31.699
they personified them
with elaborate myths

15:31.734 --> 15:34.055
involving their movements
and relationships.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.885
The sun, with its life-giving
and life-saving qualities

15:37.920 --> 15:40.393
was personified
as a representative

15:40.428 --> 15:41.941
of the unseen creator,
or God.

15:42.181 --> 15:45.853
"God's Sun," the light of the world,
the savior of human kind.

15:46.852 --> 15:48.733
Likewise,
the 12 constellations

15:48.768 --> 15:51.265
represented places of
travel for God's Sun

15:51.300 --> 15:53.708
and were identified by names,
usually representing

15:53.743 --> 15:55.960
elements of nature that happened
during that period of time.

15:56.708 --> 16:01.394
For example, Aquarius, the water bearer,
who brings the Spring rains.

16:05.438 --> 16:06.427
This is Horus.

16:07.407 --> 16:10.836
He is the Sun God of Egypt
of around 3000 BC.

16:10.871 --> 16:13.670
He is the sun,
anthropomorphized, and his life

16:13.705 --> 16:16.978
is a series of allegorical myths
involving the sun's movement in the sky.

16:17.551 --> 16:21.749
From the ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt,
we know much about this solar messiah.

16:22.056 --> 16:25.285
For instance, Horus,
being the sun, or the light,

16:25.320 --> 16:28.458
had an enemy known as Set,
and Set was the

16:28.493 --> 16:31.465
personification of
the darkness or night.

16:31.500 --> 16:35.367
And metaphorically speaking, every
morning Horus would win the battle

16:35.402 --> 16:37.823
against Set;
while in the evening,

16:37.885 --> 16:40.966
Set would conquer Horus and
send him into the underworld.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.644
It is important to note
that "dark vs. light"

16:45.679 --> 16:48.193
or "good vs. evil" is
one of the most ubiquitous

16:48.228 --> 16:51.040
mythological dualities
ever known and is

16:51.041 --> 16:53.853
still expressed on
many levels to this day.

16:54.223 --> 16:57.590
Broadly speaking, the story
of Horus is as follows:

16:58.160 --> 17:02.732
Horus was born on December
25th of the virgin Isis-Meri.

17:02.767 --> 17:06.315
His birth was accompanied
by a star in the east,

17:06.349 --> 17:09.866
and upon his birth,
he was adored by three kings.

17:10.615 --> 17:13.503
At the age of 12, he was
a prodigal child teacher,

17:13.539 --> 17:15.327
and at the age of 30
he was baptized by a

17:15.328 --> 17:17.880
figure known as Anup and
thus began his ministry.

17:17.915 --> 17:21.097
Horus had 12 disciples
he traveled about with,

17:21.132 --> 17:23.678
performing miracles such as healing
the sick and walking on water.

17:24.436 --> 17:27.021
Horus was known
by many gestural names such as

17:27.056 --> 17:29.359
The Truth, The Light,
God's Anointed Son,

17:29.394 --> 17:32.385
The Good Shepherd, The Lamb of God,
and many others.

17:32.829 --> 17:36.671
After being betrayed by Typhon,
Horus was crucified,

17:36.706 --> 17:39.894
buried for 3 days,
and thus, resurrected.

17:42.239 --> 17:46.502
These attributes of Horus, whether
original or not, seem to permeate

17:46.537 --> 17:49.507
in many cultures of the world, for
many other Gods are found to have

17:49.542 --> 17:51.613
the same
general mythological structure.

17:52.456 --> 17:54.958
Attis, of Phrygia,
born of the virgin Nana

17:54.993 --> 17:57.673
on December 25th,
crucified, placed in a tomb

17:57.708 --> 17:59.919
and after 3 days,
was resurrected.

18:01.337 --> 18:04.257
Krishna, of India,
born of the virgin Devaki

18:04.292 --> 18:06.365
with a star in the east
signaling his coming,

18:06.938 --> 18:08.947
he performed miracles
with his disciples,

18:09.150 --> 18:11.999
and upon his death
was resurrected.

18:14.372 --> 18:19.087
Dionysus of Greece, born of a virgin on
December 25th, was a traveling teacher

18:19.122 --> 18:21.613
who performed miracles such
as turning water into wine,

18:21.648 --> 18:23.930
he was referred to as
the "King of Kings,"

18:23.965 --> 18:26.448
"God's Only Begotten Son,"
"The Alpha and Omega,"

18:26.483 --> 18:28.695
and many others,
and upon his death,

18:28.730 --> 18:30.082
he was resurrected.

18:31.101 --> 18:34.403
Mithra, of Persia, born of
a virgin on December 25th,

18:34.438 --> 18:37.165
he had 12 disciples
and performed miracles,

18:37.200 --> 18:40.378
and upon his death was buried for 3 days
and thus resurrected,

18:40.413 --> 18:41.969
he was also referred to as

18:42.004 --> 18:43.768
"The Truth," "The Light,"
and many others.

18:43.803 --> 18:47.865
Interestingly, the sacred day
of worship of Mithra was Sunday.

18:51.306 --> 18:53.955
The fact of the matter is
there are numerous saviors,

18:53.990 --> 18:55.205
from different periods,

18:55.240 --> 18:59.114
from all over the world, which subscribe
to these general characteristics.

18:59.871 --> 19:01.124
The question remains:

19:01.155 --> 19:05.157
Why these attributes, why the
virgin birth on December 25th,

19:05.192 --> 19:07.812
why dead for three days and
the inevitable resurrection,

19:07.847 --> 19:10.152
why 12 disciples or followers?

19:10.564 --> 19:14.934
To find out, let's examine the
most recent of the solar messiahs.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.161
Jesus Christ was born
of the virgin Mary on

19:20.162 --> 19:22.584
December 25th in Bethlehem,
his birth was announced

19:22.619 --> 19:24.843
by a star in the east,
which three kings or magi

19:24.872 --> 19:27.166
followed to locate and
adore the new savior.

19:27.201 --> 19:29.199
He was a child teacher at 12,
at the age of 30

19:29.234 --> 19:31.263
he was baptized by
John the Baptist,

19:31.298 --> 19:33.045
and thus began his ministry.

19:33.588 --> 19:35.780
Jesus had 12 disciples
which he traveled about

19:35.815 --> 19:37.861
with performing miracles
such as healing the sick,

19:37.896 --> 19:40.564
walking on water, raising the dead,
he was also known

19:40.599 --> 19:42.214
as the "King of Kings,"
the "Son of God,"

19:42.249 --> 19:43.705
the "Light of the World,"
the "Alpha and Omega,"

19:43.740 --> 19:45.066
the "Lamb of God,"
and many others.

19:45.301 --> 19:47.436
After being betrayed by
his disciple Judas and

19:47.437 --> 19:50.130
sold for 30 pieces of
silver, he was crucified,

19:50.165 --> 19:54.766
placed in a tomb and after 3 days was
resurrected and ascended into Heaven.

19:58.815 --> 20:03.251
First of all, the birth sequence
is completely astrological.

20:04.182 --> 20:06.701
The star in the east is Sirius,
the brightest star

20:06.736 --> 20:09.052
in the night sky,
which, on December 24,

20:09.087 --> 20:12.601
aligns with the 3 brightest
stars in Orion's Belt.

20:12.636 --> 20:16.131
These 3 bright stars are
called today what they

20:16.166 --> 20:19.436
were called in ancient times:
The Three Kings.

20:20.067 --> 20:22.804
And the Three Kings and the
brightest star, Sirius,

20:22.839 --> 20:27.277
all point to the place of
the sunrise on December 25th.

20:27.312 --> 20:31.865
This is why the Three Kings "follow"
the star in the east, in order

20:31.900 --> 20:36.111
to locate the sunrise...
the birth of the sun.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.641
The Virgin Mary is the
constellation Virgo,

20:43.676 --> 20:45.504
also known as
Virgo the Virgin.

20:45.539 --> 20:47.963
Virgo in Latin
means virgin.

20:48.566 --> 20:51.668
Virgo is also referred
to as the House of Bread,

20:51.703 --> 20:55.574
and the representation of Virgo is
a virgin holding a sheaf of wheat.

20:55.609 --> 20:58.359
This House of Bread
and its symbol of wheat

20:58.394 --> 21:00.978
represents August and September,
the time of harvest.

21:01.013 --> 21:06.083
In turn, Bethlehem, in fact, literally
translates to "house of bread".

21:06.118 --> 21:09.778
Bethlehem is thus a reference
to the constellation Virgo,

21:09.813 --> 21:12.717
a place in the sky,
not on Earth.

21:13.158 --> 21:15.335
There is another very
interesting phenomenon

21:15.370 --> 21:18.295
that occurs around December 25th,
or the winter solstice.

21:18.330 --> 21:20.927
From the summer solstice
to the winter solstice,

21:20.962 --> 21:22.601
the days
become shorter and colder.

21:22.636 --> 21:24.903
And from the perspective of
the northern hemisphere,

21:24.938 --> 21:28.237
the sun appears to move south
and get smaller and more scarce.

21:28.508 --> 21:30.704
The shortening of the
days and the expiration

21:30.739 --> 21:33.363
of the crops when approaching
the winter solstice

21:33.364 --> 21:36.383
symbolized the process
of death to the ancients.

21:36.418 --> 21:38.545
It was the death of the Sun.

21:41.355 --> 21:45.025
And by December 22nd, the Sun's
demise was fully realized,

21:45.060 --> 21:48.842
for the Sun, having moved
south continually for 6 months,

21:48.877 --> 21:51.163
makes it to it's lowest point
in the sky.

21:51.899 --> 21:53.962
Here a curious thing
occurs:

21:54.538 --> 21:59.707
The Sun stops moving south,
at least perceivably, for 3 days.

21:59.742 --> 22:02.657
And during this 3 day pause,
the Sun resides

22:02.692 --> 22:07.683
in the vicinity of the Southern Cross,
or Crux, constellation.

22:07.718 --> 22:11.621
And after this time on
December 25th, the Sun

22:11.656 --> 22:14.739
moves 1 degree,
this time north,

22:14.740 --> 22:18.260
foreshadowing longer days,
warmth, and Spring.

22:18.295 --> 22:22.797
And thus it was said:
the Sun died on the cross,

22:22.832 --> 22:27.461
was dead for 3 days,
only to be resurrected or born again.

22:28.103 --> 22:31.138
This is why Jesus and
numerous other Sun Gods

22:31.173 --> 22:36.145
share the crucifixion, 3-day
death, and resurrection concept.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.333
It is the Sun's transition
period before it shifts

22:39.368 --> 22:41.867
its direction back into
the Northern Hemisphere,

22:41.868 --> 22:44.552
bringing Spring,
and thus salvation.

22:45.091 --> 22:48.276
However, they did not celebrate
the resurrection of the Sun

22:48.311 --> 22:50.851
until the spring equinox,
or Easter.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.429
This is because
at the spring equinox,

22:53.464 --> 22:56.566
the Sun officially
overpowers the evil darkness,

22:56.567 --> 22:59.817
as daytime thereafter
becomes longer in duration

22:59.852 --> 23:04.907
than the night, and the revitalizing
conditions of spring emerge.

23:04.942 --> 23:09.580
Now, probably the most obvious of all
the astrological symbolism around Jesus

23:09.615 --> 23:11.425
regards the 12 disciples.

23:11.615 --> 23:14.485
They are simply the
12 constellations of the Zodiac,

23:14.520 --> 23:18.013
which Jesus, being the Sun,
travels about with.

23:21.693 --> 23:25.026
In fact, the number 12 is
replete throughout the Bible.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.519
Coming back
to the cross of the Zodiac,

23:32.554 --> 23:34.072
the figurative life of the Sun,

23:34.673 --> 23:40.823
this was not just an artistic expression
or tool to track the Sun's movements.

23:40.858 --> 23:46.976
It was also a Pagan spiritual symbol,
the shorthand of which looked like this.

23:48.930 --> 23:51.270
This is not
a symbol of Christianity.

23:51.305 --> 23:55.893
It is a Pagan adaptation
of the cross of the Zodiac.

24:07.227 --> 24:11.663
This is why Jesus in early occult art is
always shown with his head on the cross,

24:11.713 --> 24:15.918
for Jesus is the Sun,
the "Sun of God",

24:15.960 --> 24:19.207
the "Light of the World",
the "Risen Savior",

24:19.242 --> 24:22.319
who will "come again,"
as it does every morning,

24:22.622 --> 24:27.582
the "Glory of God" who defends
against the "works of darkness",

24:27.617 --> 24:30.665
as he is "born again"
every morning,

24:30.700 --> 24:34.164
and can be seen
"coming in the clouds,"

24:34.199 --> 24:42.137
"up in Heaven," with his
"Crown of Thorns," or sun rays.

24:47.570 --> 24:51.512
Now, of the many
astrological-astronomical metaphors

24:51.547 --> 24:53.633
in the Bible,
one of the most important

24:53.668 --> 24:55.281
has to do with the ages.

24:56.271 --> 24:59.795
Throughout the scripture there are
numerous references to the "Age."

24:59.830 --> 25:01.649
In order to understand this,

25:01.684 --> 25:03.745
we need to be familiar
with the phenomenon

25:03.746 --> 25:06.362
known as the
Precession of the Equinoxes.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.262
The ancient Egyptians
along with cultures

25:09.303 --> 25:12.111
long before them recognized
that approximately every

25:12.146 --> 25:14.913
2150 years,
the sunrise on the morning

25:14.948 --> 25:18.681
of the spring equinox would occur
at a different sign of the Zodiac.

25:19.616 --> 25:22.829
This has to do with a
slow angular wobble that

25:22.864 --> 25:25.281
the Earth maintains
as it rotates on it's axis.

25:25.654 --> 25:29.238
It is called a precession because
the constellations go backwards,

25:29.273 --> 25:31.025
rather than through
the normal yearly cycle.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.862
The amount of time
that it takes for

25:32.863 --> 25:35.053
the precession to go
through all 12 signs

25:35.088 --> 25:38.724
is roughly 25,765 years.

25:38.759 --> 25:41.237
This is also called
the "Great Year,"

25:41.476 --> 25:44.733
and ancient societies
were very aware of this.

25:44.768 --> 25:49.606
And they referred to each 2150
year period as an "age."

25:51.148 --> 25:56.087
From 4300 B.C. to 2150 B.C.,
it was the Age of Taurus, the Bull.

25:56.122 --> 26:00.858
From 2150 BC to 1 AD.,
it was the Age of Aries, the Ram

26:00.893 --> 26:05.095
and from 1 AD. to 2150 AD.
it is the Age of Pisces,

26:05.130 --> 26:07.859
the age we are still
in to this day.

26:09.028 --> 26:12.196
And in and around 2150,
we will enter the new age.

26:12.231 --> 26:14.067
The Age of Aquarius.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.890
Now, the Bible reflects,
broadly speaking,

26:18.925 --> 26:21.410
a symbolic movement
through 3 ages,

26:21.445 --> 26:23.039
while foreshadowing a 4th.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.746
In the Old Testament,
when Moses comes

26:25.781 --> 26:27.820
down Mount Sinai with
the 10 Commandments,

26:27.855 --> 26:32.280
he is very upset to see his people
worshiping a golden bull calf.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.610
In fact,
he shattered the stone tablets

26:35.645 --> 26:39.398
and instructed his people to kill each
other in order to purify themselves.

26:39.433 --> 26:42.648
Most Biblical scholars
would attribute this anger

26:42.683 --> 26:45.816
to the fact that the Israelites
were worshiping a false idol,

26:45.851 --> 26:46.839
or something
to that effect.

26:47.327 --> 26:49.531
The reality is
that the golden bull

26:49.566 --> 26:54.381
is Taurus the Bull, and Moses represents
the new Age of Aries the Ram.

26:54.910 --> 26:57.883
This is why Jews even today
still blow the Ram's horn.

26:57.918 --> 27:03.105
Moses represents the new Age of Aries,
and upon the new age,

27:03.140 --> 27:05.086
everyone must shed
the old age.

27:05.626 --> 27:09.707
Other deities mark these
transitions as well, such as Mithra

27:09.742 --> 27:13.789
a pre-Christian God who kills
the bull, in the same symbology.

27:14.735 --> 27:19.163
Now Jesus is the figure who
ushers in the age following Aries,

27:19.198 --> 27:21.766
the Age of Pisces,
or the Two Fish.

27:22.877 --> 27:26.863
Fish symbolism is very
abundant in the New Testament,

27:26.898 --> 27:30.850
as Jesus feeds 5000 people
with bread and "2 fish."

27:31.486 --> 27:34.926
When he begins his ministry
walking along Galilee,

27:34.961 --> 27:37.824
he befriends 2 fishermen,
who follow him.

27:38.394 --> 27:40.412
And I think
we've all seen the

27:40.413 --> 27:42.431
Jesus-fish on the
backs of people's cars.

27:42.466 --> 27:45.058
Little do they know
what it actually means.

27:45.700 --> 27:49.449
It is a Pagan astrological
symbolism for

27:49.450 --> 27:53.198
the Sun's Kingdom
during the Age of Pisces.

27:53.942 --> 27:59.244
Also, Jesus' assumed birth date is
essentially the start of this age.

28:00.816 --> 28:04.938
At Luke 22:10 when Jesus
is asked by his disciples

28:04.973 --> 28:08.685
where the last passover
would be, Jesus replies:

28:08.720 --> 28:12.163
"Behold, when ye are
entered into the city, there

28:12.198 --> 28:15.437
shall a man meet you
bearing a pitcher of water...

28:15.472 --> 28:18.531
follow him into the house
where he entereth in."

28:19.136 --> 28:21.649
This scripture is
by far one of the most

28:21.650 --> 28:24.714
revealing of all the
astrological references.

28:24.749 --> 28:27.646
The man bearing a pitcher
of water is Aquarius,

28:27.681 --> 28:32.644
the water-bearer, who is always pictured
as a man pouring out a pitcher of water.

28:33.217 --> 28:36.201
He represents
the age after Pisces,

28:36.236 --> 28:40.458
and when the Sun (God's Sun)
leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus),

28:40.493 --> 28:42.458
it will go into the House of Aquarius,

28:42.493 --> 28:45.691
as Aquarius follows Pisces in
the precession of the equinoxes.

28:46.031 --> 28:49.556
All Jesus is saying is that
after the Age of Pisces

28:49.591 --> 28:51.402
will come
the Age of Aquarius.

28:56.173 --> 29:00.649
Now, we have all heard about the
end times and the end of the world.

29:01.332 --> 29:04.449
The cartoonish depictions
in the Book of Revelation,

29:04.484 --> 29:08.585
the main source of this idea
comes from Matthew 28:20,

29:08.620 --> 29:13.190
where Jesus says: "I will be with
you even to the end of the world."

29:13.678 --> 29:15.414
However,
in King James Version,

29:15.454 --> 29:19.927
"world" is a mistranslation,
among many mistranslations.

29:20.233 --> 29:25.432
The actual word being used is "aeon",
which means "age."

29:25.705 --> 29:28.907
"I will be with you even
to the end of the age."

29:28.942 --> 29:34.038
Which is true, as Jesus' Solar
Piscean personification will end when

29:34.073 --> 29:36.598
the Sun enters
the Age of Aquarius.

29:36.633 --> 29:40.206
The entire concept of end
times and the end of the world

29:40.241 --> 29:42.856
is a misinterpreted
astrological allegory.

29:42.891 --> 29:46.019
Let's tell that
to the approximately

29:46.160 --> 29:50.426
100 million people in America who
believe the end of the world is coming.

29:51.465 --> 29:53.784
Furthermore,
the character of Jesus,

29:53.785 --> 29:56.280
being a literary
and astrological hybrid,

29:56.315 --> 30:01.708
is most explicitly a plagiarization
of the Egyptian Sun-God Horus.

30:02.205 --> 30:06.118
For example,
inscribed about 3500 years ago,

30:06.153 --> 30:09.345
on the walls of the
Temple of Luxor in Egypt

30:09.380 --> 30:13.164
are images of the enunciation,
the miracle conception,

30:13.165 --> 30:16.949
the birth,
and the adoration of Horus.

30:17.225 --> 30:20.505
The images begin with
Thaw announcing to the virgin Isis

30:20.540 --> 30:21.961
that she will conceive
Horus,

30:21.996 --> 30:25.699
then Nef the holy ghost
impregnating the virgin,

30:26.434 --> 30:29.403
and then the virgin birth
and the adoration.

30:30.172 --> 30:34.131
This is exactly the story of
Jesus' miracle conception.

30:34.977 --> 30:37.963
In fact,
the literary similarities between

30:38.002 --> 30:41.884
the Egyptian religion and the
Christian religion are staggering.

30:52.428 --> 30:54.863
And the plagiarism is
continuous.

30:54.898 --> 30:59.067
The story of Noah and Noah's Ark
is taken directly from tradition.

30:59.102 --> 31:02.669
The concept of a Great Flood is
ubiquitous throughout the ancient world,

31:02.704 --> 31:06.236
with over 200 different cited claims
in different periods and times.

31:06.476 --> 31:09.096
However,
one need look no further for

31:09.097 --> 31:11.716
a pre-Christian source
than the Epic of Gilgamesh

31:11.751 --> 31:14.378
written in 2600 B.C.

31:14.919 --> 31:18.695
This story talks of a Great Flood
commanded by God,

31:18.730 --> 31:21.040
an Ark
with saved animals upon it,

31:21.075 --> 31:24.891
and even the release
and return of a dove,

31:24.926 --> 31:27.164
all held in common
with the biblical story,

31:27.199 --> 31:30.065
among many other similarities.

31:31.836 --> 31:34.688
And then there is the
plagiarized story of Moses.

31:34.723 --> 31:37.507
Upon Moses' birth,
it is said that he was placed

31:37.542 --> 31:42.462
in a reed basket and set adrift in
a river in order to avoid infanticide.

31:42.497 --> 31:47.382
He was later rescued by a daughter of
royalty and raised by her as a Prince.

31:47.986 --> 31:51.381
This baby in a basket story
was lifted directly

31:51.410 --> 31:55.540
from the myth of Sargon of Akkad,
of around 2250 B.C.

31:55.575 --> 31:59.334
Sargon was born,
placed in a reed basket,

31:59.335 --> 32:03.094
in order to avoid infanticide,
and set adrift in a river.

32:03.402 --> 32:07.533
He was in turn rescued and
raised by Akki, a royal mid-wife.

32:08.174 --> 32:10.825
Furthermore,
Moses is known as the Law Giver,

32:10.826 --> 32:13.476
the giver of the Ten Commandments,
the Mosaic Law.

32:13.713 --> 32:16.328
However, the idea of a
Law being passed from God

32:16.358 --> 32:20.313
to a prophet, up on a mountain,
is also a very old motif.

32:20.721 --> 32:25.317
Moses is just a law giver in a long line
of law givers in mythological history.

32:25.626 --> 32:28.294
In India,
Manou was the great law giver.

32:28.329 --> 32:32.697
In Crete, Minos ascended Mount Dicta,
where Zeus gave him the sacred laws.

32:32.965 --> 32:36.335
While in Egypt there was Mises,
who carried stone tablets

32:36.370 --> 32:38.573
and upon them,
the laws of God were written.

32:39.907 --> 32:44.708
Manou, Minos,
Mises, Moses.

32:45.045 --> 32:46.712
And as far
as the Ten Commandments,

32:46.747 --> 32:50.985
they are taken outright from Spell 125
of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

32:51.020 --> 32:52.452
What the
Book of the Dead phrased

32:52.487 --> 32:55.406
"I have not stolen" became
"Thou shall not steal,"

32:55.441 --> 32:58.291
"I have not killed" became
"Thou shall not kill,"

32:58.326 --> 33:01.899
"I have not told lies" became
"Thou shall not bare false witness",

33:01.934 --> 33:03.632
and so forth.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.132
In fact,
the Egyptian religion is likely

33:06.167 --> 33:10.870
the primary foundational basis for the
Judeo-Christian theology.

33:10.905 --> 33:15.232
Baptism, afterlife,
final judgement, virgin birth,

33:15.267 --> 33:17.713
death and resurrection,
crucifixion,

33:17.748 --> 33:20.482
the ark of the covenant,
circumcision,

33:20.483 --> 33:23.417
saviors, holy communion,
the great flood,

33:23.452 --> 33:27.736
Easter, Christmas, Passover,
and many many more,

33:27.771 --> 33:30.459
are all attributes of
Egyptian ideas,

33:30.494 --> 33:33.327
long pre-dating
Christianity and Judaism.

33:33.730 --> 33:36.147
Justin Martyr,
one of the first Christian

33:36.186 --> 33:39.293
historians and defenders,
wrote:

33:39.836 --> 33:42.772
"When we say that he,
Jesus Christ, our teacher,

33:42.773 --> 33:45.709
was produced without sexual union,
was crucified

33:45.744 --> 33:48.529
and died, and rose again,
and ascended into Heaven,

33:48.942 --> 33:51.314
we propound nothing different
from what

33:51.349 --> 33:55.683
you believe regarding those who
you esteem Sons of Jupiter."

33:56.253 --> 33:58.587
In a different writing,
Justin Martyr said:

33:58.622 --> 34:01.570
"He was born of a virgin,
accept this in common,

34:01.605 --> 34:03.761
with what you believe
of Perseus."

34:03.796 --> 34:08.900
It's obvious that Justin and other early
Christians knew how similar Christianity

34:08.935 --> 34:11.266
was to the
Pagan religions.

34:11.302 --> 34:13.368
However,
Justin had a solution.

34:13.591 --> 34:18.141
As far as he was
concerned, the Devil did it.

34:18.177 --> 34:21.357
The Devil had the foresight
to come before Christ,

34:21.391 --> 34:24.536
and create these characteristics
in the Pagan world.

34:27.652 --> 34:29.987
Fundamentalist Christianity,
fascinating.

34:30.022 --> 34:34.652
These people actually believe
the World is 12,000 years old.

34:37.429 --> 34:41.431
I actually asked one of these guys:
"OK, dinosaur fossils?"

34:41.467 --> 34:47.896
He says: "Dinosaur fossils?
God put those here to test our faith!"

34:52.811 --> 34:56.279
"I think God put you here
to test my faith, dude!"

35:01.054 --> 35:04.757
The Bible is nothing more than an
astro-theological literary hybrid,

35:04.792 --> 35:07.861
just like nearly all
religious myths before it.

35:07.896 --> 35:10.328
In fact,
the aspect of transference,

35:10.363 --> 35:12.866
of one character's attributes
to a new character,

35:12.867 --> 35:15.369
can be found
within the book itself.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.272
In the Old Testament,
there's the story of Joseph.

35:18.307 --> 35:21.571
Joseph
was a prototype for Jesus.

35:22.042 --> 35:26.241
Joseph was born of a miracle birth,
Jesus was born of a miracle birth.

35:26.515 --> 35:30.216
Joseph was of 12 brothers,
Jesus had 12 disciples.

35:30.251 --> 35:34.620
Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver,
Jesus was sold for 30 pieces of silver.

35:34.655 --> 35:38.387
Brother "Judah" suggests
the sale of Joseph,

35:38.388 --> 35:42.119
disciple "Judas" suggests
the sale of Jesus.

35:42.497 --> 35:47.068
Joseph began his work at the age of 30,
Jesus began his work at the age of 30.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.434
The parallels go
on and on.

35:49.771 --> 35:53.217
Furthermore, is there any
non-Biblical historical evidence

35:53.252 --> 35:55.745
of any person,
living with the name Jesus,

35:55.780 --> 35:58.780
the Son of Mary,
who traveled about with 12 followers,

35:58.815 --> 36:00.214
healing people
and the like?

36:00.249 --> 36:02.717
There are numerous historians
who lived in

36:02.718 --> 36:05.186
and around the Mediterranean
either during or soon

36:05.221 --> 36:07.712
after the assumed life of Jesus.

36:08.124 --> 36:11.093
How many of these historians
document this figure?

36:11.128 --> 36:12.754
Not one.

36:13.496 --> 36:16.197
However, to be fair,
that doesn't mean defenders

36:16.232 --> 36:19.333
of the Historical Jesus
haven't claimed the contrary.

36:19.368 --> 36:23.240
Four historians are typically
referenced to justify Jesus's existence.

36:23.275 --> 36:26.944
Pliny the younger, Suetonius,
Tacitus are the first three.

36:26.979 --> 36:29.177
Each one of their entries
consists of only a few

36:29.212 --> 36:33.364
sentences at best and only refer
to the Christus or the Christ,

36:33.399 --> 36:37.059
which in fact is not name but a title.
It means the Anointed One.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.696
The fourth source is
Josephus

36:39.747 --> 36:44.222
and this source has been proven to
be a forgery for hundreds of years.

36:44.294 --> 36:46.743
Sadly,
it is still cited as truth.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.819
You would think that a guy
who rose from the dead

36:52.820 --> 36:55.438
and ascended into Heaven
for all eyes to see

36:55.473 --> 36:58.142
and performed the wealth of miracles
acclaimed to him

36:58.143 --> 37:00.812
would have made it into
the historical record.

37:00.847 --> 37:03.613
It didn't because once
the evidence is weighed,

37:03.648 --> 37:08.382
there are very high odds that the figure
known as Jesus, did not even exist.

37:22.635 --> 37:26.127
We don't want to be unkind,
but we want to be factual.

37:26.538 --> 37:32.011
We don't want to cause hurt feelings,
but we want to be academically correct,

37:32.046 --> 37:34.640
in what we understand
and know to be true.

37:35.048 --> 37:39.417
Christianity
just is not based on truth.

37:40.086 --> 37:42.907
We find that Christianity
was in fact nothing more

37:42.957 --> 37:47.231
than a Roman story,
developed politically.

37:49.664 --> 37:55.935
The reality is, Jesus was the Solar
Deity of the Gnostic Christian sect,

37:55.970 --> 38:00.071
and like all other Pagan Gods,
he was a mythical figure.

38:00.106 --> 38:02.942
It was the political establishment
that sought

38:02.977 --> 38:07.513
to historize the Jesus figure
for social control.

38:08.549 --> 38:14.353
By 325 AD. in Rome, Emperor Constantine
conviened the Council of Nicea,

38:14.388 --> 38:15.684
It was
during this meeting that

38:15.704 --> 38:19.261
the politically motivated
Christian Doctrines were established

38:19.296 --> 38:24.297
and thus began a long history of
Christian bloodshed and spiritual fraud.

38:24.332 --> 38:26.131
And for the next
1600 years,

38:26.181 --> 38:31.506
the Vatican maintained a political
stranglehold on all of Europe,

38:31.541 --> 38:34.839
leading to such joyous periods
as the Dark Ages,

38:35.377 --> 38:40.644
along with enlightening events such
as the Crusades, and the Inquisition.

38:44.386 --> 38:47.778
Christianity, along with all
other theistic belief systems,

38:47.813 --> 38:50.092
is the fraud of the age.

38:50.127 --> 38:55.798
It serves to detach the species from the
natural world, and likewise, each other.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.767
It supports blind
submission to authority.

38:58.802 --> 39:03.439
It reduces human responsibility to the
effect that "God" controls everything,

39:03.474 --> 39:09.496
and in turn awful crimes can be
justified in the name of Divine Pursuit.

39:09.531 --> 39:15.519
And most importantly, it empowers those
who know the truth but use the myth

39:15.554 --> 39:18.821
to manipulate and control societies.

39:18.856 --> 39:22.292
The religious myth is the most
powerful device ever created,

39:22.293 --> 39:25.729
and serves
as the psychological soil

39:25.764 --> 39:29.894
upon which other myths
can flourish.

39:32.737 --> 39:37.800
A myth is an idea that,
while widely believed, is false.

39:40.177 --> 39:45.091
In a deeper sense,
in the religious sense,

39:46.274 --> 39:49.519
a myth serves as an orienting
and mobilizing story for people.

39:51.389 --> 39:55.655
The focus is not on the story's relation
to reality but on its function.

39:57.396 --> 40:02.641
A story cannot function,
unless it is believed to be true

40:02.676 --> 40:04.988
in the community
or the nation.

40:06.008 --> 40:10.504
It is not a matter of debate
if some people have the bad taste

40:10.539 --> 40:14.367
to raise the question of
the truth of the sacred story.

40:14.402 --> 40:16.604
The keepers of the faith do not
enter into the debate with them.

40:17.316 --> 40:21.370
They ignore them,
or denounce them as blasphemers.

40:21.405 --> 40:24.129
It is wrong, blasphemous
and sinful for you

40:24.160 --> 40:25.456
to suggest,
imply or help other people

40:25.759 --> 40:28.944
to come to conclusion
that the U.S. Government

40:28.979 --> 40:30.642
killed 3,000
of its own citizens.

41:15.110 --> 41:18.042
As if a demolition team
set off,

41:18.077 --> 41:20.240
when you do the demolition
of an old building.

41:20.275 --> 41:22.549
It looks like one of those scenes
of an old building

41:22.584 --> 41:24.786
being purposely dynamited
and blown up.

41:24.821 --> 41:27.666
Anybody who ever watched
a building being demolished,

41:27.701 --> 41:29.855
on purpose, knows that if
you're going to do this

41:29.890 --> 41:33.821
you have to get the under-infrastructure
of the building and bring it down.

41:33.856 --> 41:35.461
The way the structure
is collapsing...

41:35.662 --> 41:38.189
This was the result of something
that was planned.

41:38.224 --> 41:42.166
It's not accidental that the
first tower just happened to collapse

41:42.201 --> 41:45.888
and then the second tower just happened
to collapse in exactly the same way.

41:45.923 --> 41:48.399
How they accomplished this,
we don't know.

41:48.434 --> 41:50.741
The building
collapsed to dust.

41:51.863 --> 41:55.376
You don't find a desk,
you don't find a chair,

41:55.411 --> 41:58.367
you don't find a telephone
or computer.

41:58.402 --> 42:03.133
The biggest piece of a telephone I found
was half of the keypad,

42:03.168 --> 42:04.190
and it was about this big.

42:04.728 --> 42:06.196
What happened
to the concrete?

42:06.231 --> 42:07.630
The concrete was pulverized.

42:07.665 --> 42:09.633
From river to river,

42:09.634 --> 42:12.027
this dust powder,
two or three inches thick,

42:12.062 --> 42:15.401
The concrete was just uh...
pulverized!

42:15.436 --> 42:19.075
Reminiscence of pictures
we've all seen too much in TV before,

42:19.110 --> 42:22.773
a building is deliberately destroyed by
well placed dynamite to knock it down.

42:23.481 --> 42:26.780
It's as if they had detonators,
yes, detonators,

42:26.815 --> 42:29.651
planted to take down the building,
boom, boom, boom!

42:29.686 --> 42:31.216
I heard a second explosion.

42:31.251 --> 42:33.184
There was a heavy-duty explosion.

42:33.219 --> 42:36.036
There was a secondary explosion
and then a subsequent collapse.

42:36.071 --> 42:38.934
...explosion blow and then
it knocked everybody over.

42:38.969 --> 42:40.549
To me it sounded like an explosion.

42:40.584 --> 42:43.085
It sounded like gun-fire,
bang-bang-bang.

42:43.120 --> 42:45.493
And then all of a sudden,
three big explosions.

42:45.528 --> 42:47.201
...and we heard big explosion
coming down.

42:47.236 --> 42:48.773
...and then the entire top
of the building just blew up.

42:49.008 --> 42:50.100
We saw
some kind of explosion.

42:50.376 --> 42:51.934
...by the force of the explosions...

42:52.278 --> 42:55.509
- ...big explosion...
- It blew us back into the 8th floor...

42:55.544 --> 42:57.714
...then we got to lobby,
there was a big explosion.

42:57.749 --> 42:59.374
The lobby looked as though,
a bomb had exploded there.

42:59.752 --> 43:03.137
...huge explosion,
now raining debris...

43:03.172 --> 43:05.213
...there's been a huge explosion...

43:05.248 --> 43:06.715
...huge explosion that
we all heard and felt.

43:07.060 --> 43:11.033
We just witnessed some
kind of explosion...

43:11.068 --> 43:13.934
...it was very loud... it blasted...
explosion...

43:13.969 --> 43:17.095
...smoke and secondary
explosion in Tower 1...

43:17.130 --> 43:18.828
...that is another bomb
going off...

43:18.863 --> 43:21.207
He thinks that there
were actually devices

43:21.242 --> 43:22.924
that were planted
in the building...

43:22.959 --> 43:24.297
...planted in the building...

44:03.682 --> 44:06.863
I don't think anybody
could have predicted

44:06.898 --> 44:09.448
that they would try to use
an airplane as a missile,

44:09.483 --> 44:11.324
a hijacked airplane
as a missile.

44:11.359 --> 44:12.739
...nobody in our government at least,

44:12.774 --> 44:14.535
and I don't think the prior government
could have envisioned

44:14.570 --> 44:15.661
flying airplanes
into the buildings.

44:15.899 --> 44:19.385
No specific threats involving,
really domestic operations

44:19.386 --> 44:22.872
involving what happened obviously,
the cities, airlines and so on.

44:22.907 --> 44:26.568
There were no warning
signs that I am aware of.

44:26.876 --> 44:31.245
USAToday reports that in the two years
before the attacks on September 11th

44:31.714 --> 44:36.981
NORAD conducted exercises using
hijacked airliners as weapons.

44:37.720 --> 44:40.712
And one target was
the World Trade Center.

44:50.868 --> 44:53.558
In confidential documents
from the Philippines

44:53.593 --> 44:55.568
obtained by CNN,
the plan was clear:

44:55.841 --> 44:59.390
He would board any American
commercial aircraft,

44:59.391 --> 45:02.939
control its cockpit, and dive
it at the CIA headquarters.

45:03.180 --> 45:06.616
Other buildings targeted
the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.

45:07.184 --> 45:10.876
Security and counter-terrorism
was blinking red,

45:10.911 --> 45:11.952
in the words of
George Tenet,

45:12.257 --> 45:16.402
that the warnings of an
imminent attack were so severe,

45:16.437 --> 45:18.163
that something dramatic
should have been done.

45:18.198 --> 45:19.858
It was unparalleled.

45:20.098 --> 45:23.397
Instead, our president went
on a month long vacation?

45:32.096 --> 45:36.843
The head of Pakistani Intelligence
of the ISI, Mahmood Ahmed

45:36.878 --> 45:42.053
requested Omar Sheikh
to wire $100,000

45:42.088 --> 45:44.217
to Mohammed Atta,
who was the lead hijacker.

45:44.252 --> 45:48.985
...hijacker Mohammed Atta received
wire transfers via Pakistan.

45:49.020 --> 45:51.766
The man sending the money
to Atta is

45:51.801 --> 45:53.332
believed to be
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.968
Omar Sheikh admitted
he was supported by

45:57.003 --> 45:59.295
the Pakistani Government's
Intelligence service; the ISI.

46:19.193 --> 46:23.250
Although we are told that 4 or 5
of the alleged hijackers

46:23.285 --> 46:24.734
were on each of the flights,

46:24.769 --> 46:26.725
if so their names should have
been on the flight manifest.

46:27.235 --> 46:30.321
But the flight manifest
that had been released

46:30.356 --> 46:32.910
contained neither the names
of the alleged hijackers

46:32.945 --> 46:35.125
nor any
Arab names whatsoever.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.987
We know that the men who
were supposedly the hijackers

46:38.022 --> 46:42.261
had their houses, cars, credit cards
paid for by the U.S. Government.

46:42.296 --> 46:44.268
They were, in truth,
agents.

46:44.303 --> 46:46.676
Evidence was also
apparently planted.

46:46.711 --> 46:49.285
The passport of
one of the hijackers on

46:49.320 --> 46:51.692
Flight 11 was allegedly
found in the rubble.

46:51.727 --> 46:54.460
...it goes through the fireball,
through the side of the plane

46:54.495 --> 46:56.750
and comes down
on the ground unscathed.

46:56.785 --> 46:58.255
But something happened.

46:58.290 --> 47:01.109
For 6 months they reported
they had this passport...

47:01.144 --> 47:02.871
"Boy, we got it,
we got the proof"

47:02.906 --> 47:05.021
and then the guy stood up
and was alive.

47:05.056 --> 47:08.425
Several of these 19 men
are still alive.

47:40.111 --> 47:44.470
Of course we're after Saddam Hussein,
I mean bin Laden, he's, he's, he's...

47:44.505 --> 47:46.151
January 2001.

47:46.332 --> 47:51.635
The Bush Administration orders
the FBI and intelligence agencies

47:51.670 --> 47:55.695
to back off investigations
involving the bin Laden family,

47:55.730 --> 47:59.226
including two of
Osama bin Laden's relatives

47:59.261 --> 48:02.616
who were living, guess where?
In Falls Church, Virginia,

48:02.651 --> 48:03.695
right next to CIA headquarters.

48:04.136 --> 48:06.366
When he was already America's
"most wanted criminal"

48:07.105 --> 48:11.320
he reportedly spent two weeks in
the American hospital in Dubai,

48:11.355 --> 48:16.127
was treated by an American doctor
and visited by the local CIA agent,

48:16.442 --> 48:20.893
We have not seen one piece of
evidence that links Osama bin Laden

48:20.928 --> 48:23.711
directly to the planning stages
of September 11th.

48:23.746 --> 48:27.183
This failure to provide proof
was later said to be unnecessary

48:27.218 --> 48:30.723
because bin Laden in the video
allegedly found in Afghanistan,

48:30.758 --> 48:33.176
admitted responsibility
for the attacks.

48:33.211 --> 48:35.097
This confession is now
widely cited as proof.

48:35.802 --> 48:38.614
But the man in this
video has darker skin,

48:38.649 --> 48:40.481
fuller cheeks
and a broader nose

48:40.516 --> 48:42.737
than the Osama bin Laden
of all other videos.

48:42.772 --> 48:45.216
We again seem to have
the planted evidence.

48:45.634 --> 48:50.614
In 1976, Osama's older brother,
Saleem bin Laden,

48:50.649 --> 48:53.964
hired a man in Texas
by the name of Jim Bath

48:53.999 --> 48:57.056
to handle all the investments in the
United States for the bin Laden family.

48:57.458 --> 49:01.752
Jim Bath also happens to be a personal,
almost life-long friend

49:01.787 --> 49:04.549
and former international guard pilot,
with George W. Bush.

49:04.584 --> 49:07.719
The connections between the
Bushes and the bin Ladens

49:07.754 --> 49:09.665
become much more
clearer when

49:09.700 --> 49:14.803
George Herbert Walker Bush made
trips to Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 2000

49:14.838 --> 49:17.620
to meet
with the bin Laden family

49:17.655 --> 49:19.943
on behalf of the company
called the Carlyle Group.

49:46.596 --> 49:50.917
How could anyone fly a 60 ton,
125 ft wide,

49:50.952 --> 49:54.309
44 ft tall plane
through this obstacle course.

49:54.344 --> 49:56.379
The aircraft,
before striking the Pentagon,

49:56.399 --> 50:00.483
reportedly executed a
270 degree downward spiral

50:01.707 --> 50:05.158
and yet Hani Hanjour
was known as a terrible pilot

50:05.193 --> 50:08.168
who could not safely fly,
even a small plane.

50:19.990 --> 50:24.108
No seats, no luggage, no bodies.
Nothing but bricks and limestone.

50:24.515 --> 50:27.049
The official explanation is that
the intense heat

50:27.084 --> 50:29.346
from the jet fuel
vaporized the entire plane.

50:29.381 --> 50:33.653
Flight 77 had two Rolls Royce engines
made of steel and titanium alloy

50:33.688 --> 50:35.198
and weighed 6 tons each.

50:35.233 --> 50:37.379
It is scientifically impossible

50:37.479 --> 50:41.188
that 12 tons of steel and titanium
was vaporized by jet fuel.

50:41.223 --> 50:44.457
We're also told that the bodies
were able to be identified

50:45.537 --> 50:48.005
either by the
fingerprints or by the DNA.

50:48.640 --> 50:53.053
So what kind of fire can vaporize
aluminum and tempered steel

50:53.088 --> 50:56.355
and yet leave
human bodies intact?

50:56.390 --> 51:00.386
From my close-up inspection,
there's no evidence of a plane

51:00.421 --> 51:02.291
having crashed anywhere
near the Pentagon

51:02.326 --> 51:05.784
and as I say the only
pieces left that you can see

51:05.819 --> 51:08.118
are small enough that you
can pick up in your hand.

51:08.153 --> 51:09.312
Shortly after the strike,

51:09.361 --> 51:11.593
government agents picked up
debris and carried it off.

51:12.865 --> 51:15.703
The entire lawn was covered
with dirt and gravel

51:15.738 --> 51:18.734
so that any remaining
forensic evidence

51:18.769 --> 51:20.169
was literally covered up.

51:20.204 --> 51:24.871
The videos from security cameras which
would show what really hit the Pentagon

51:24.906 --> 51:27.812
were immediately confiscated
by agents of the FBI.

51:28.790 --> 51:31.747
And the Department of Justice has to
this day, refused to release them.

51:32.685 --> 51:36.918
If these videos would prove that
the Pentagon was really hit by a 757,

51:37.697 --> 51:40.224
most of us would assume
the Government would release them.

51:53.583 --> 51:56.143
It looks like there's nothing there
except for a hole in the ground.

51:56.478 --> 51:57.604
Basically,
that's right.

51:57.913 --> 52:00.866
The only thing you could see
from where we were, uh, was

52:00.901 --> 52:02.612
a big gouge in the earth
and some broken trees.

52:03.252 --> 52:06.244
You could see some people working,
walking around in the area,

52:06.888 --> 52:09.186
but from where we can see
there wasn't much left.

52:09.591 --> 52:11.183
Any large pieces of debris
at all?

52:11.459 --> 52:12.751
No, there was nothing.

52:12.973 --> 52:16.362
Nothing, that you can distinguish
that a plane had crashed there.

52:41.858 --> 52:44.951
Pancake theory,
according to which the fires,

52:44.986 --> 52:46.022
although not
melting the steel,

52:46.330 --> 52:50.602
heated up sufficiently to cause the
floors weakened by the airplane strikes

52:50.637 --> 52:54.334
to break loose from the steel columns,
and this started a chain reaction.

52:54.369 --> 52:58.077
So, you would expect then from that
theory, which is the official theory,

52:58.112 --> 53:01.933
to see a whole stack of floors
piled up on top of each other

53:01.968 --> 53:04.143
and then a spindle of core columns
standing too.

53:04.482 --> 53:08.782
The core of each of the Twin Towers
consisted of 47 massive steel columns.

53:09.365 --> 53:10.917
If the floors had
broken loose from them,

53:11.222 --> 53:14.556
these columns would have still been
sticking up in the air a thousand feet.

53:15.227 --> 53:17.787
The plane did not cut
all those core columns.

53:18.711 --> 53:22.917
We designed the buildings
to take the impact of the Boeing 707,

53:23.459 --> 53:26.103
hitting the building
at any location.

53:26.138 --> 53:30.932
The building probably could sustain
multiple impacts of jetliners.

53:31.510 --> 53:33.575
...that the plane flew
straight into the building.

53:33.646 --> 53:34.806
Straight through, right.

53:35.147 --> 53:36.563
So you're saying
that the building

53:36.564 --> 53:39.309
was actually designed to cope
with a hole like that

53:39.344 --> 53:41.110
- and would still survive?
- Yes, it was.

53:41.687 --> 53:44.640
If you would drop,
say a billiard ball

53:44.641 --> 53:48.019
from the top of the World Trade Center,
110 floors up there

53:48.054 --> 53:50.856
it would have taken 8 to 10 seconds
to hit the ground,

53:50.891 --> 53:52.662
encountering no resistance
whatsoever.

53:53.133 --> 53:55.498
The Twin Towers came down
in nearly free fall speed.

53:56.035 --> 54:00.496
200,000 tons of steel shatters
and explodes outwards over 500 ft.

54:00.874 --> 54:04.112
This means that floors shattered
at an average rate

54:04.147 --> 54:05.868
of about
ten floors per second.

54:06.346 --> 54:09.440
There is no scenario for a
pancake effect of buildings falling

54:09.683 --> 54:11.480
that allows them to fall
at a rate of free fall.

54:12.086 --> 54:14.554
And what can do that? What
can move mass out of the way?

54:15.156 --> 54:16.123
Explosives.

54:23.464 --> 54:27.629
47 huge steel columns going up
the core that are interconnected,

54:28.470 --> 54:32.530
how do you get them to fail
simultaneously so the core disappeared.

54:32.907 --> 54:34.932
It looks like
those core columns were cut.

54:36.010 --> 54:39.969
The way we do this is by
cutting the beam at an angle.

54:56.733 --> 54:58.894
I started looking
at the molten metal.

54:59.602 --> 55:02.398
All three buildings,
both towers in the rubble,

55:02.433 --> 55:04.767
in the basement areas,
and Building 7

55:05.173 --> 55:07.141
there were
these pools of molten metal.

55:18.321 --> 55:21.377
You get down below and
you see molten steel.

55:22.049 --> 55:24.420
Molten steel
running down the channel rails.

55:25.062 --> 55:28.998
Like you were in a foundry.
Like lava of a volcano.

55:29.666 --> 55:33.188
The molten steel was found
'three, four and five weeks later

55:33.188 --> 55:34.984
when the rubble
was being removed.'

55:35.019 --> 55:38.736
He said that molten steel was also
found underneath World Trade Center 7.

55:39.511 --> 55:41.427
So I'm looking through
the official reports,

55:41.428 --> 55:43.323
what do they say about
the molten metal?

55:43.647 --> 55:44.909
They say nothing.

55:45.883 --> 55:48.613
Wait a minute.
This is important evidence.

55:49.219 --> 55:50.277
Where did that come from?

55:53.291 --> 55:56.966
Thermite is so hot
that it'll just cut through steel,

55:57.001 --> 55:58.888
through the structural steel,
for example,

55:59.264 --> 56:00.561
like a knife through butter.

56:01.232 --> 56:05.457
The products are molten iron
and aluminum oxide

56:05.492 --> 56:07.604
which goes off primarily
as a dust.

56:09.241 --> 56:10.936
You know,
those enormous dust clouds

56:11.443 --> 56:14.435
you can imagine, when you assemble
these chemicals on a large scale.

56:29.762 --> 56:35.068
Molten metal pools under both towers
after they collapsed, and Building 7.

56:35.103 --> 56:37.593
Now, Building 7 wasn't even
hit by a jet.

56:38.772 --> 56:42.230
Part of the problem is that most people
simply don't know much about Building 7.

56:42.676 --> 56:45.702
due to the extraordinary secrecy
surrounding its collapse.

56:46.112 --> 56:48.673
This was a
47 story skyscraper.

56:49.083 --> 56:52.518
This building fell at 17:25.

56:52.919 --> 56:54.045
It was not hit by a plane.

56:54.855 --> 56:57.824
This building had fires
on only 2 or 3 floors.

56:58.124 --> 57:02.288
...and it was brought down by what
we know was a controlled demolition.

57:02.529 --> 57:04.964
Demolitions look just like that,
kink in the middle,

57:05.266 --> 57:08.633
and then that building just comes
straight down almost at free fall speed.

57:08.970 --> 57:11.504
They first blow
one of the central columns

57:11.539 --> 57:13.464
so the building falls in
on itself.

57:13.741 --> 57:16.710
Building 7
had a classic crimp or wedge.

57:17.079 --> 57:18.876
Its central column
was blown out first

57:19.214 --> 57:22.775
so it didn't structurally damaged
buildings just a few feet away from it.

57:42.838 --> 57:44.329
Our office
was on the B-1 level.

57:44.489 --> 57:47.119
As I was talking to a supervisor
at 8.46

57:47.577 --> 57:51.325
and all of a sudden,
we hear, boom!

57:51.326 --> 57:55.074
An explosion so hard
that pushed us upwards.

57:56.419 --> 58:00.618
And it came from the basement,
between the B-2 level and the B-3 level.

58:01.425 --> 58:04.755
And when I went to verbalize,
we heard boom!

58:04.790 --> 58:07.465
That impact
of the plane on the top.

58:07.964 --> 58:10.996
As I'm walking by the main freight car
of the building in the corridor,

58:12.020 --> 58:14.539
that's when I got blown.

58:15.072 --> 58:19.065
I mean, the impact of the
explosion threw me to the floor

58:19.576 --> 58:20.873
and that's when everything
started happening.

58:21.278 --> 58:22.677
All of a sudden,
a big impact happened again

58:23.447 --> 58:25.322
and all the ceiling tiles
were falling down,

58:25.357 --> 58:26.678
the light fixtures
were falling...

58:26.984 --> 58:30.751
You know, you gotta go clear across
the whole from 1 to 2 World Trade Center

58:31.589 --> 58:33.318
and then all of a sudden,
it happened all over again.

58:33.692 --> 58:36.957
Something else hit us to the floor...
right in the basement you felt it,

58:37.262 --> 58:39.195
the walls were caving in on,
everything that was going on.

58:39.663 --> 58:42.599
I mean, I know people that
got killed in the basement,

58:42.901 --> 58:45.199
I know people that got
broken legs in the basement,

58:45.537 --> 58:48.665
people got reconstructive surgery
because the walls hit them in the face.

58:58.718 --> 59:00.505
According to
standard operating procedure,

59:00.556 --> 59:03.121
if an FAA flight control
notices anything

59:03.456 --> 59:04.980
that suggests a possible hijacking,

59:05.291 --> 59:06.849
controllers are to
contact the superior.

59:07.193 --> 59:09.127
If the problem cannot be
fixed within about a minute

59:09.428 --> 59:12.694
the superior should ask NORAD
(North American Aerospace Command)

59:12.966 --> 59:15.991
to send up or scramble jet fighters
to find out what is going on.

59:16.435 --> 59:18.500
NORAD then issues
a scramble order to

59:18.501 --> 59:20.565
the nearest air force base,
with fighters on alert.

59:21.240 --> 59:24.641
And although interceptions usually
occur within 10 or so minutes,

59:24.944 --> 59:28.460
in this case,
80 or so minutes had elapsed

59:28.495 --> 59:30.110
before the fighters
were even airborne.

59:30.617 --> 59:32.448
It's a mind-bending anomaly.

59:32.886 --> 59:37.152
Not a single US Air Force interceptor
turns a wheel until it's too late.

59:37.691 --> 59:39.420
There are no jets at all.

59:39.827 --> 59:41.337
What if they were
so confused,

59:41.976 --> 59:46.134
and had been so deliberately confused
that they couldn't respond?

59:46.169 --> 59:49.002
The reason that they
didn't know where to go

59:49.037 --> 59:51.784
was because a number of
conflicting and overlapping

59:51.785 --> 59:54.532
war game exercises
were taking place

59:54.876 --> 59:57.727
that involved the insertion
of false radar blips

59:57.975 --> 01:00:01.000
on the radar screens in the
north-east air defense sector.

01:00:13.996 --> 01:00:16.445
There was another exercise;
"Vigilant Warrior",

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.895
which was in fact,
according to a NORAD source,

01:00:19.234 --> 01:00:22.260
a live-fly hijack drill
being conducted at the same time.

01:00:22.772 --> 01:00:26.965
With only 8 available fighter aircrafts,
and that have to be dispatched in pairs,

01:00:27.026 --> 01:00:32.345
they were dealing with as many as 22
possible hijacks on the day of 9/11

01:00:32.481 --> 01:00:37.381
and they couldn't separate the war
game exercises from the actual hijacks.

01:01:04.447 --> 01:01:05.948
Page 172:

01:01:05.983 --> 01:01:08.463
"The US Government has
not been able to determine

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:10.943
the origin of the money
used for the 9/11 attacks.

01:01:11.489 --> 01:01:14.151
Ultimately, the question is of
little practical significance."

01:01:14.692 --> 01:01:16.910
The American authorities
have not managed

01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:19.129
to trace
the source of the funding.

01:01:19.498 --> 01:01:22.549
And then the most amazingly
disingenuous statement,

01:01:22.584 --> 01:01:25.203
"Ultimately is it of
little consequence".

01:01:25.238 --> 01:01:27.564
It is of
massive consequence!

01:01:27.673 --> 01:01:29.340
Doesn't it matter
who paid for 9/11?

01:01:29.774 --> 01:01:32.442
The collapse of Building 7
has been recognized

01:01:32.443 --> 01:01:35.111
as especially
difficult to explain.

01:01:35.414 --> 01:01:38.297
The 9/11 Commission Report
implicitly admitted

01:01:38.298 --> 01:01:41.181
that it could not explain the
collapse of this building

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.148
by not even mentioning it.

01:01:43.588 --> 01:01:45.564
Mr. President,
why are you and the Vice President

01:01:45.606 --> 01:01:48.649
insisting on appearing together
before the 9/11 Commission?

01:01:49.128 --> 01:01:52.120
Because the 9/11 Commission wants to ask
us questions, that's why we are meeting,

01:01:52.231 --> 01:01:55.997
and I look forward to meeting with
them and answering their questions.

01:01:56.169 --> 01:01:58.219
The question was:
Why are you appearing together,

01:01:58.259 --> 01:02:00.450
rather than separately,
which was their request?

01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:03.677
Because it's a good chance
for both of us

01:02:03.707 --> 01:02:06.106
to answer questions
that the 9/11 Commission

01:02:06.513 --> 01:02:10.677
is looking forward to asking us, and
I am looking forward to answering them.

01:02:12.352 --> 01:02:15.809
Do you think they should be able to
stand up and speak their own words?

01:02:15.888 --> 01:02:17.049
They should go under oath.

01:02:17.124 --> 01:02:18.289
- They should be--
- Yeah. In public.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:34.935
Don't you think that
the families deserve

01:02:35.206 --> 01:02:37.287
to have a transcript
or to be able to see--

01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:39.866
Adam, you asked me
this question yesterday,

01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:41.714
I got the same answer.
Yeah.

01:02:42.617 --> 01:02:44.754
The final report
was a unanimous report.

01:02:44.944 --> 01:02:46.780
That means that if
there was a single commissioner

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.438
who had any objection
about anything,

01:02:49.479 --> 01:02:51.937
that fact would be
dropped from the report.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:55.133
We have found out that
he not only served on

01:02:55.134 --> 01:02:57.867
the transition team
of the Bush Administration,

01:02:58.131 --> 01:03:01.412
that he was a person
who wrote a draft memo for the

01:03:01.447 --> 01:03:04.251
setup of the Bush Administration's
National Security Council,

01:03:04.312 --> 01:03:07.502
that he was an individual who
wrote the preemptive war strategy

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.820
that was eventually
used for the war on Iraq,

01:03:09.872 --> 01:03:12.059
that he's a close friend
of Condoleezza Rice's...

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:14.881
We want him to resign.

01:03:15.285 --> 01:03:17.799
There is literally nothing
in the 9/11 report

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.313
that the Bush Administration
did not approve of.

01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:24.890
We can understand therefore why that
commission under Zelikow leadership

01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:28.731
would have ignored all the evidence
that would point to the truth

01:03:29.499 --> 01:03:31.865
that 9/11
was a false flag operation

01:03:32.369 --> 01:03:35.486
intended to authorize the doctrines
and funds needed

01:03:35.487 --> 01:03:38.604
for a new level of
imperial mobilization.

01:03:55.526 --> 01:03:59.197
Armed with knives. Armed with chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.

01:03:59.232 --> 01:04:01.816
Fanatics. Terrorists. September 11th.
September 11th. Killers.

01:04:01.851 --> 01:04:04.491
September 11th. Terrorists.
Terrorists. Al Qaeda, Terrorists.

01:04:04.526 --> 01:04:07.132
Nuclear weapons. Terror. 9/11.
Terror. Terror. Terror. Evil.

01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:11.543
September 11th. September 11th.
The terrorists. War and danger.

01:04:11.578 --> 01:04:15.047
September 11th. Terrorism.
Global terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorist.

01:04:15.082 --> 01:04:18.081
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist,
Terrorist. The terrorists.

01:04:18.116 --> 01:04:22.120
Terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorism.
September 11th. Global terrorism.

01:04:22.155 --> 01:04:26.125
Terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorists.
September 11th. World terrorism.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.650
Terrorists. Terrorism.
September 11th. Global Terrorism.

01:04:29.028 --> 01:04:31.331
September the 11th. Terrorist.
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist,

01:04:31.366 --> 01:04:34.098
Terrorist. Weapons of mass destruction.
September the 11th.

01:04:34.133 --> 01:04:38.898
September the 11th. Terrorists. The evil
terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorists know!

01:04:38.933 --> 01:04:42.450
Terrorism. The words are
hypnotically repeated:

01:04:42.485 --> 01:04:45.616
Terrorism. Terrorists.
Terrorist threat.

01:04:45.617 --> 01:04:48.748
And of course,
believe-to-be-linked-to-al-Qaeda.

01:04:49.294 --> 01:04:52.873
But, it's the so-called
"War on Terrorism"

01:04:52.908 --> 01:04:54.449
that's in our faces,
practically 24/7

01:04:54.822 --> 01:04:57.290
as the inescapable focus
of our existence.

01:04:57.558 --> 01:05:02.689
One day, our grandchildren will
look back on this time and ask:

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.785
"How was
the war on terror won?"

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.103
The entire US ruling class,
ruling elite

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:13.049
comes to see terrorism as the
preferred means, indeed the only means,

01:05:13.084 --> 01:05:15.643
to provide social cohesion,

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:19.275
to provide an enemy image for
the society, to keep it together.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:20.663
According to NeoCon Theory
from Carl Schmitt,

01:05:20.714 --> 01:05:22.429
you have to have
an enemy image,

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:23.894
in order
to have a society.

01:05:23.929 --> 01:05:27.268
A very dangerous thing because now
it means that the entire social order,

01:05:27.303 --> 01:05:30.419
the political parties, intellectual life,
politics in general,

01:05:30.454 --> 01:05:32.858
are all based
on a monstrous myth.

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:09.834
Look, what the CIA has
done in this country.

01:06:09.869 --> 01:06:12.090
What they have done to us
is unbelievable.

01:06:12.125 --> 01:06:14.453
Look at the terrorist acts
that have occurred.

01:06:14.488 --> 01:06:15.431
The CIA behind most,
if not, all of them.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.973
We had the Marine Barracks,
then embassy in Kenya,

01:06:20.763 --> 01:06:25.757
We had Pan Am 103,
we had the USS Cole,

01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:30.372
we had Oklahoma City, we had
the World Trade Center in 1993.

01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:35.254
...that helped the terrorists
to blow up the WTC the first time.

01:06:35.289 --> 01:06:37.120
They built the bomb,
they got the driver's license.

01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:41.616
The informer
Emad A. Salem,

01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:44.727
a 43-year-old former
Egyptian Army officer,

01:06:44.762 --> 01:06:47.993
he was given the assignment
to put the bomb together

01:06:48.028 --> 01:06:50.492
and he went to the supervisor,
that's the FBI supervisor,

01:06:50.527 --> 01:06:52.679
and he said,
"We're gonna put a dummy bomb" right?

01:06:52.714 --> 01:06:55.928
and the FBI supervisor says
"No, we're gonna put a real bomb."

01:06:55.963 --> 01:07:01.557
The FBI actually carried out the attack
on the World Trade Center in 1993.

01:07:01.592 --> 01:07:06.301
They actually hired Emad Salem
and paid him 1 million dollars

01:07:06.336 --> 01:07:10.766
and gave him real explosives,
a detonator and told him to build a bomb

01:07:10.801 --> 01:07:13.726
and to give it to the foolish people
that he was controlling

01:07:13.761 --> 01:07:17.232
to allow them to attack
the World Trade Center complex.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:22.447
Unfortunately for them,
there were only six people killed,

01:07:22.482 --> 01:07:24.156
not enough
to pass the legislation.

01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:26.754
So, what happened
is two years later,

01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:32.269
April 19, 1995 down comes
Oklahoma City, the Murrah Building,

01:07:32.304 --> 01:07:37.077
168 people killed... one year later,
the anti-terror legislation,

01:07:37.112 --> 01:07:38.662
which takes away
many of our constitutional rights

01:07:38.682 --> 01:07:40.422
and civil liberties,
is passed.

01:08:12.192 --> 01:08:13.936
It was at half past 9
this morning.

01:08:13.971 --> 01:08:16.906
We were actually running an exercise
for a company

01:08:16.941 --> 01:08:17.939
of over a thousand people
in London

01:08:17.974 --> 01:08:21.117
based on simultaneous bombs
going off precisely

01:08:21.152 --> 01:08:22.823
at the railway stations
where it happened this morning,

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:25.586
so I still have the hairs on the back
of my neck standing up right!

01:08:25.621 --> 01:08:28.626
To get this quite straight,
you were running an exercise

01:08:28.661 --> 01:08:30.265
to see how you would
cope with this

01:08:30.301 --> 01:08:32.024
and it happened
while you were running the exercise?

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:32.955
Precisely.

01:08:38.955 --> 01:08:41.642
We're supposed to believe it
was some kind of coincidence.

01:08:41.676 --> 01:08:45.943
There was also an anti-terrorist
drill going on on 7/7.

01:08:45.978 --> 01:08:48.185
And again,
just like on 9/11,

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.710
they were talking about attacks on the
same targets, the same tube stations

01:08:52.745 --> 01:08:56.684
at the exactly the same time
as the actual attack happened

01:08:56.719 --> 01:08:59.849
providing some
kind of cover for what

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:02.979
must be operations orchestrated
in some way by the State.

01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:37.073
I am absolutely appalled at how much
people in this country do not think.

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:45.515
We are given to understand that an
Arabic guy out there up in the mountains

01:09:45.551 --> 01:09:49.676
financed the most elaborate
attack on this country.

01:09:49.712 --> 01:09:56.239
Do you think some people in a cave
were able to have NORAD stand down?

01:09:56.274 --> 01:10:01.125
Do you think that people in the cave
were able to have all of this happen?

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:06.276
And when I think about how many
Americans were killed in New York City

01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:10.719
and believing as I do that
this thing was a set up job,

01:10:10.754 --> 01:10:14.431
this is a textbook operation
that Nazis used

01:10:14.466 --> 01:10:17.540
and they've used it
over and over again.

01:10:17.575 --> 01:10:21.086
America has been suckered in
one more time.

01:10:24.822 --> 01:10:28.827
I don't have to tell you things are bad.
Everybody knows things are bad.

01:10:28.862 --> 01:10:32.097
The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
Banks are going bust,

01:10:32.132 --> 01:10:34.392
shopkeepers keep a gun
under the counter.

01:10:34.427 --> 01:10:36.498
Punks are running wild
in the streets.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.230
There's nobody anywhere who
seems to know what to do,

01:10:38.265 --> 01:10:39.193
and there's no end to it.

01:10:40.739 --> 01:10:44.780
We know the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat.

01:10:44.815 --> 01:10:48.834
We sit watching our TVs
while some local newscaster tells us

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:52.152
that today we had
15 homicides and 63 violent crimes

01:10:52.187 --> 01:10:53.967
as if that's the way
it's supposed to be!

01:10:54.002 --> 01:10:57.750
We know things are bad.
Worse than bad. They're crazy.

01:10:57.785 --> 01:10:59.594
It's like everything everywhere
is going crazy,

01:10:59.629 --> 01:11:00.977
so we don't go out anymore.

01:11:01.012 --> 01:11:04.560
We sit in the house and slowly the world
we're living in is getting smaller.

01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:08.177
And all we say is, "Please, at least
leave us alone in our living rooms.

01:11:08.212 --> 01:11:11.735
Let me have my toaster and my TV,
my steel-belted radials

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:13.658
and I won't say anything.
Just leave us alone."

01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:16.516
Well I'm not gonna leave you alone.
I want you to get mad!

01:11:17.619 --> 01:11:20.467
I don't want you to protest,
I don't want you to riot.

01:11:20.502 --> 01:11:22.101
I don't want you to
write to your congressman

01:11:22.158 --> 01:11:22.619
because I wouldn't know
what to tell you to write.

01:11:22.959 --> 01:11:26.213
I don't know what to do about
the depression and the inflation

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.234
and the Russians and
the crime in the street,

01:11:28.269 --> 01:11:31.044
All I know is that first
you've got to get mad!

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:34.365
You've got to say,
"I'm a human being, goddamn it!

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.922
My life has value!

01:12:31.163 --> 01:12:32.249
Oh God!

01:13:00.927 --> 01:13:04.226
"When hostilities
commenced in Europe in 1939

01:13:04.497 --> 01:13:08.900
it was realized that the American people
had no intention of entering the war

01:13:10.036 --> 01:13:12.581
but they believed that
this country could be enticed

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:15.431
into the war,
in very much the same way,

01:13:15.562 --> 01:13:17.676
that it was enticed
into the last one

01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:23.356
They planned, first, to prepare
the United States for foreign war,

01:13:23.391 --> 01:13:26.124
under the guise
of American defense

01:13:27.623 --> 01:13:33.026
Second, to involve us in the war,
step by step without our realization.

01:13:34.095 --> 01:13:37.100
Third,
to create a series of incidences,

01:13:37.135 --> 01:13:39.788
which would force us
into the actual conflict.

01:13:40.601 --> 01:13:44.929
These plans were, of course,
to be covered and assisted

01:13:44.964 --> 01:13:47.247
by the full power
of their propaganda,

01:13:48.877 --> 01:13:51.962
Our theaters soon became
filled with plays,

01:13:51.997 --> 01:13:53.939
portraying
the glory of war.

01:13:54.907 --> 01:13:57.914
News reels lost all
semblance of objectivity.

01:13:59.055 --> 01:14:03.867
and they have used the war to justify
the restriction of congressional power

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:07.433
and the assumption of
dictatorial procedures,

01:14:07.468 --> 01:14:09.948
on the part of
the President and his appointees.

01:14:12.602 --> 01:14:14.662
A fear campaign was inaugurated.

01:14:18.408 --> 01:14:22.561
We cannot allow the natural passions
and prejudices,

01:14:22.562 --> 01:14:26.714
of other peoples,
to lead our country to destruction"

01:15:01.906 --> 01:15:06.145
1775, the
American Revolutionary War began,

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.677
as the American colonies
sought to detach from England,

01:15:08.712 --> 01:15:09.628
and it's oppressive monarchy.

01:15:09.663 --> 01:15:13.075
Although many reasons are
cited for the revolution,

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:16.056
one in particular sticks
out as the prime cause:

01:15:16.064 --> 01:15:21.417
that King George III of England outlawed
the interest free independent currency

01:15:21.452 --> 01:15:24.426
the colonies were producing
and using for themselves,

01:15:24.461 --> 01:15:27.374
in turn forcing them
to borrow money from

01:15:27.409 --> 01:15:29.842
the Central Bank of England,
at interest,

01:15:29.877 --> 01:15:32.058
immediately putting
the colonies into debt.

01:15:32.093 --> 01:15:34.938
And as Benjamin Franklin
later wrote:

01:15:34.973 --> 01:15:38.154
The refusal of King George III
to allow the colonies

01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:39.707
to operate
an honest money system,

01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:42.978
which freed the ordinary man from
the clutches of the money manipulators

01:15:43.013 --> 01:15:46.268
was probably
the prime cause of the revolution.

01:15:46.303 --> 01:15:49.744
In 1783, America won its independence
from England.

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:53.522
However, its battle against the
central bank concept and the corrupt,

01:15:53.557 --> 01:15:56.033
greed-filled men associated with it,
had just begun.

01:15:57.592 --> 01:15:59.027
So what is a Central Bank?

01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:01.613
A Central Bank
is an institution

01:16:01.648 --> 01:16:03.963
that produces the currency
of an entire nation.

01:16:03.998 --> 01:16:07.370
Based on historical precedent,
two specific powers

01:16:07.405 --> 01:16:09.474
are inherent in
central banking practice.

01:16:09.509 --> 01:16:12.387
The control of interest rates,
and the

01:16:12.422 --> 01:16:14.962
control of the money supply,
or inflation.

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:18.851
The central bank does not simply supply
a government's economy with money,

01:16:18.886 --> 01:16:21.235
it loans it to them
at interest.

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:25.680
Then, through the use of increasing
and decreasing the supply of money,

01:16:25.715 --> 01:16:29.641
the central bank regulates the
value of the currency being issued.

01:16:30.432 --> 01:16:34.556
It is critical to understand that
the entire structure of this system

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:37.670
can only produce one thing
in the long run:

01:16:38.171 --> 01:16:39.215
Debt.

01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:42.907
It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity
to figure this scam out.

01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:48.136
For every single dollar produced by the
central bank is loaned at interest.

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:51.690
That means every single dollar
produced is actually the dollar,

01:16:51.725 --> 01:16:55.282
plus a certain percent of debt
based on that dollar.

01:16:55.317 --> 01:16:58.203
And since a central bank
has a monopoly

01:16:58.238 --> 01:17:00.890
over the production of the currency
for the entire country,

01:17:00.925 --> 01:17:05.913
and they loan each dollar out
with immediate debt attached to it,

01:17:06.258 --> 01:17:08.766
where does the money to
pay for the debt come from?

01:17:09.287 --> 01:17:11.848
It can only come from
the central bank again.

01:17:11.883 --> 01:17:15.430
Which means the central bank
has to perpetually increase

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:19.364
its money supply to temporarily cover
the outstanding debt created,

01:17:19.399 --> 01:17:23.518
which in turn, since that new money
is loaned out at interest as well,

01:17:23.553 --> 01:17:25.124
creates even more debt!

01:17:25.159 --> 01:17:28.806
The end result of this system
without fail is slavery.

01:17:28.841 --> 01:17:31.775
For it is impossible for the government
and thus the public,

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:34.932
to ever come out of the
self-generating debt.

01:17:34.967 --> 01:17:38.243
The founding fathers of this country
were well aware of this.

01:18:06.335 --> 01:18:09.569
By the early 20th century,
the US had already implemented,

01:18:09.604 --> 01:18:11.981
and removed a few
central banking systems,

01:18:12.016 --> 01:18:15.515
which were swindled into place
by ruthless banking interests.

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:19.487
At this time, the dominant families
in the banking and business world were:

01:18:19.522 --> 01:18:24.567
the Rockefellers, the Morgans,
the Warburgs, the Rothschilds.

01:18:24.602 --> 01:18:28.429
And in the early 1900's,
they sought to push once again,

01:18:28.484 --> 01:18:32.031
legislation to create
another central bank,

01:18:32.753 --> 01:18:34.091
However,
they knew the government

01:18:34.092 --> 01:18:36.485
and public were weary
of such an institution.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.379
So they needed to create
an incident to affect public opinion.

01:18:40.414 --> 01:18:45.045
So, J.P. Morgan, publicly considered
a financial luminary at the time,

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:48.941
exploited his mass influence
by publishing rumors

01:18:48.976 --> 01:18:51.522
that a prominent bank in New York
was insolvent, or bankrupt.

01:18:52.359 --> 01:18:55.355
Morgan knew this would
cause mass hysteria

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:58.432
which would affect other banks
as well, and it did.

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:01.010
The public,
in fear of losing their deposits,

01:19:01.045 --> 01:19:03.451
immediately began
mass withdrawals.

01:19:03.486 --> 01:19:06.540
Consequently, the banks were
forced to call in their loans,

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.684
causing the recipients
to sell their property,

01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:12.880
and thus a spiral of bankruptcies,
repossessions, and turmoil emerged.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:15.524
Putting the pieces together
a few years later,

01:19:15.559 --> 01:19:17.553
Fredrik Allen of
LIFE Magazine wrote:

01:19:17.588 --> 01:19:21.690
"The Morgan interests took advantage
to precipitate the panic of 1907

01:19:21.725 --> 01:19:24.031
guiding it shrewdly,
as it progressed."

01:19:24.066 --> 01:19:27.665
Unaware of the fraud,
the Panic of 1907 led to

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.990
a Congressional investigation,
headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich,

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:34.119
who had intimate ties
to the banking cartels,

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.972
and later became part of the
Rockefeller family through marriage.

01:19:37.007 --> 01:19:39.714
The Commission led by Aldrich
recommended

01:19:39.749 --> 01:19:41.544
a Central Bank
should be implemented,

01:19:41.579 --> 01:19:44.879
so a panic like 1907
"could never happen again".

01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:49.484
This was the spark the international
bankers needed to initiate their plan.

01:19:49.519 --> 01:19:53.624
In 1910, a secret meeting was
held at a J.P. Morgan estate

01:19:53.659 --> 01:19:55.459
on Jekyll Island off
the coast of Georgia.

01:19:55.494 --> 01:19:57.909
It was there that the
central banking bill

01:19:57.944 --> 01:19:59.920
called the Federal Reserve Act
was written.

01:19:59.955 --> 01:20:03.654
This legislation was written by bankers,
not law-makers.

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:06.158
This meeting
was so secretive,

01:20:06.193 --> 01:20:08.556
so concealed from government
and public knowledge,

01:20:08.591 --> 01:20:10.916
that the 10 or so figures
who attended,

01:20:10.917 --> 01:20:13.242
disguised their names
when in route to the island.

01:20:13.277 --> 01:20:16.837
After this bill was constructed,
it was then handed over

01:20:16.872 --> 01:20:19.756
to their political front-man,
Senator Nelson Aldrich,

01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:21.233
to push through Congress.

01:20:21.268 --> 01:20:25.776
And in 1913, with heavy political
sponsorship by the bankers,

01:20:25.811 --> 01:20:27.703
Woodrow Wilson
became President,

01:20:27.738 --> 01:20:30.410
having already agreed
to sign the Federal Reserve Act

01:20:30.445 --> 01:20:32.262
in exchange
for campaign support.

01:20:32.297 --> 01:20:35.042
And 2 days before Christmas,
when most of Congress

01:20:35.077 --> 01:20:37.994
was at home with their families,
the Federal Reserve Act was voted in,

01:20:38.029 --> 01:20:39.759
and Wilson in turn made it law.

01:20:40.094 --> 01:20:43.386
Later, Woodrow Wilson wrote,
in regret:

01:21:15.174 --> 01:21:18.200
Congressman Louis McFadden
also expressed

01:21:18.235 --> 01:21:20.162
the truth
after the passage of the bill:

01:21:20.197 --> 01:21:22.715
"A world banking system
was being set up here...

01:21:22.716 --> 01:21:25.705
a superstate controlled
by international bankers,

01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:29.059
acting together to enslave the world
for their own pleasure.

01:21:29.094 --> 01:21:31.021
The Fed has usurped
the government."

01:21:31.847 --> 01:21:34.639
Now, the public was told that
the Federal Reserve System

01:21:34.674 --> 01:21:36.644
was an economic stabilizer.

01:21:36.679 --> 01:21:40.569
And inflation and economic crisis
were a thing of the past.

01:21:40.919 --> 01:21:44.637
Well, as history has shown,
nothing is further from the truth.

01:21:44.672 --> 01:21:47.037
The fact is the international bankers
now had

01:21:47.087 --> 01:21:50.506
a streamlined machine
to expand their personal ambitions.

01:21:54.048 --> 01:21:57.258
For example,
from 1914 to 1919,

01:21:57.293 --> 01:22:00.313
the Fed increased the
money supply by nearly 100%.

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:04.185
Resulting in extensive loans
to small banks and the public.

01:22:04.527 --> 01:22:07.132
Then in 1920, the Fed called in
massive percentages

01:22:07.167 --> 01:22:08.418
of the outstanding
money supply,

01:22:08.453 --> 01:22:12.629
thus resulting in the supporting banks
having to call in huge numbers of loans,

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:17.955
and just like in 1907: bank runs,
bankruptcy, and collapse occurred.

01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:22.772
Over 5400 competitive banks outside of
the Federal Reserve System collapsed.

01:22:22.807 --> 01:22:26.680
Further consolidating the monopoly to
a small group of international bankers.

01:22:27.577 --> 01:22:32.126
Privy to this crime, Congressman
Lindberg stepped up, and said in 1921:

01:22:32.161 --> 01:22:36.370
"Under the Federal Reserve Act,
panics are scientifically created.

01:22:36.405 --> 01:22:39.450
The present panic is the first
scientifically created one,

01:22:39.485 --> 01:22:41.960
worked out as we figure
a mathematical equation."

01:22:42.566 --> 01:22:45.502
However, the panic of
1920 was just a warm-up.

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:50.125
From 1921 to 1929, the Fed again
increased the money supply,

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.766
resulting once again in extensive
loans to the public and banks.

01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:55.883
There was also
a fairly new type of loan

01:22:55.918 --> 01:22:57.805
called a margin loan
in the stock market.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.464
Very simply,
a margin loan allowed an investor

01:23:00.499 --> 01:23:02.590
to put down
only 10% of a stocks price,

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:05.631
with the other 90%
being loaned through the broker.

01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:10.208
In other words, a person could own $1000
worth of stock with only $100 down.

01:23:10.243 --> 01:23:13.018
This method was very popular
in the roaring 1920's,

01:23:13.053 --> 01:23:14.922
as everyone seemed to be
making money in the market.

01:23:15.267 --> 01:23:17.227
However,
there was a catch to this loan.

01:23:17.262 --> 01:23:21.624
It could be called in at any time,
and had to be paid within 24 hours.

01:23:21.659 --> 01:23:23.140
This is termed a margin call,

01:23:23.175 --> 01:23:25.405
and the typical result
of a margin call is

01:23:25.406 --> 01:23:27.636
the selling of the stock
purchased with the loan.

01:23:28.352 --> 01:23:31.293
So, a few months
before October of 1929,

01:23:31.534 --> 01:23:33.454
J.D. Rockefeller,
Bernard Baruck,

01:23:33.489 --> 01:23:35.862
and other insiders
quietly exited the market,

01:23:35.897 --> 01:23:39.916
and on October 24th, 1929,
the New York financiers who

01:23:39.951 --> 01:23:42.490
furnished the margin loans
started calling them in, in mass.

01:23:43.196 --> 01:23:46.976
This sparked an instantaneous
massive sell-off in the market,

01:23:47.011 --> 01:23:48.823
for everyone had to
cover their margin loans.

01:23:48.858 --> 01:23:51.447
It then triggered mass bank runs
for the same reason,

01:23:51.448 --> 01:23:54.586
in turn collapsing over
16,000 banks,

01:23:54.621 --> 01:23:56.955
enabling the conspiring
international bankers

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.107
to not only buy up rival banks
at a discount,

01:23:59.142 --> 01:24:02.317
but to also buy up whole corporations
at pennies on the dollar.

01:24:02.352 --> 01:24:04.485
It was the greatest robbery
in American history.

01:24:04.585 --> 01:24:06.221
But that didn't stop there.

01:24:06.256 --> 01:24:10.139
Rather than expand the money supply
to recover from this economic collapse,

01:24:10.174 --> 01:24:12.128
the Fed actually
contracted it,

01:24:12.129 --> 01:24:14.461
fueling one of the largest
depressions in history.

01:24:14.496 --> 01:24:18.232
Once again outraged,
Congressman Louis McFadden,

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.324
a long-time opponent
of the banking cartels,

01:24:20.359 --> 01:24:23.533
began bringing impeachment proceedings
against the Federal Reserve Board,

01:24:23.568 --> 01:24:25.192
saying of
the crash and depression:

01:24:25.407 --> 01:24:26.806
"It was a carefully
contrived occurrence.

01:24:27.142 --> 01:24:30.490
International bankers sought to
bring about a condition of despair,

01:24:30.525 --> 01:24:32.773
so that they might emerge
the rulers of us all."

01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:36.954
Not surprisingly, and after 2
previous assassination attempts,

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:39.236
McFadden was
poisoned at a banquet

01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:41.010
before he could push
for the impeachment.

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:44.754
Now, having reduced
the society to squalor,

01:24:44.755 --> 01:24:48.248
the Federal Reserve bankers decided that
the Gold Standard should be removed.

01:24:48.396 --> 01:24:50.335
In order to do this,
they needed to acquire

01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:52.060
the remaining gold in the system.

01:24:52.095 --> 01:24:54.745
So, under the pretense
of helping to end

01:24:54.746 --> 01:24:57.945
the Depression came
the 1933 Gold Seizure.

01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:01.150
Under threat of imprisonment
for 10 years, everyone in America

01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:03.990
was required to turn in all
gold bullion to the Treasury,

01:25:04.025 --> 01:25:06.740
essentially robbing the public of
what little wealth they had left.

01:25:07.558 --> 01:25:10.663
At the end of 1933,
the gold standard was abolished.

01:25:10.698 --> 01:25:13.605
If you look at a dollar bill
from before 1933,

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.912
it says
it is redeemable in gold.

01:25:16.771 --> 01:25:18.317
If you look
at a dollar bill today,

01:25:18.352 --> 01:25:22.328
it says it is legal tender, which means
it is backed by absolutely nothing.

01:25:22.533 --> 01:25:24.114
It is worthless paper.

01:25:24.234 --> 01:25:26.065
The only thing that
gives our money value

01:25:26.066 --> 01:25:27.897
is how much of it
is in circulation.

01:25:28.651 --> 01:25:31.763
Therefore the power
to regulate the money supply

01:25:31.815 --> 01:25:34.220
is also the power
to regulate its value,

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:39.108
which is also the power to bring entire
economies and societies to its knees.

01:25:47.091 --> 01:25:49.308
It's important
to clearly understand:

01:25:49.343 --> 01:25:51.512
The Federal Reserve
is a private corporation.

01:25:51.547 --> 01:25:54.063
It is about as "Federal"
as "Federal Express."

01:25:54.333 --> 01:25:56.657
It makes its own policies,
and is under

01:25:56.692 --> 01:25:58.360
virtually no regulation
by the US government.

01:25:58.671 --> 01:26:02.241
It is a private bank
that loans all the currency

01:26:02.276 --> 01:26:03.631
at interest
to the government,

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:06.474
completely consistent
with the fraudulent

01:26:06.475 --> 01:26:09.608
central banking model that the
country sought to escape from

01:26:09.643 --> 01:26:12.511
when it declared independence in
the American Revolutionary War.

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:16.325
Now, going back to 1913,
the Federal Reserve Act was not

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.554
the only unconstitutional bill
pushed through Congress.

01:26:18.825 --> 01:26:22.283
They also pushed
the federal income tax.

01:26:22.462 --> 01:26:24.103
It's worthwhile
to point out that

01:26:24.154 --> 01:26:27.355
the American public's ignorance
towards the federal income tax

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:30.431
is a testament to how
dumbed-down and oblivious

01:26:30.466 --> 01:26:32.267
the American population
really is.

01:26:32.573 --> 01:26:36.508
First of all, the federal income
tax is completely unconstitutional,

01:26:36.676 --> 01:26:38.940
as it is a direct,
unapportioned tax.

01:26:39.245 --> 01:26:43.204
All direct taxes have to be apportioned
to be legal based on the Constitution.

01:26:43.416 --> 01:26:46.118
Secondly, the required
number of states in order to

01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:49.420
ratify the amendment to allow
the income tax was never met,

01:26:49.455 --> 01:26:51.616
and this has even been cited in
modern court cases.

01:26:57.566 --> 01:27:00.706
Third, at the present day,
roughly 25%

01:27:00.741 --> 01:27:02.999
of the average worker's income
is taken via this tax.

01:27:03.205 --> 01:27:05.227
and guess where that money goes.

01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:09.286
It goes to pay the interest on
the currency being produced

01:27:09.321 --> 01:27:11.995
by the fraudulent
Federal Reserve Bank,

01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:14.693
a system that does not
have to exist, at all.

01:27:14.728 --> 01:27:17.604
The money you make working
almost three months

01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:19.369
out of the year
goes almost literally

01:27:19.371 --> 01:27:21.869
into the pockets of the
international bankers,

01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:24.721
who own the private
Federal Reserve Bank,

01:27:24.893 --> 01:27:27.421
And fourth, even with
the fraudulent government

01:27:27.456 --> 01:27:29.058
claim as to the legality
of the income tax,

01:27:29.298 --> 01:27:34.514
there is literally no statute,
no law in existence,

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:36.683
that requires you
to pay this tax.

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:37.632
Period.

01:27:37.707 --> 01:27:41.584
I really expected that
of course there's a law,

01:27:41.619 --> 01:27:46.836
that you can point to in the law book
that requires you to file a tax return.

01:27:46.871 --> 01:27:47.344
Of course there is.

01:27:47.683 --> 01:27:50.638
I was at that point
where I couldn't find

01:27:50.673 --> 01:27:53.255
the statute that clearly
made a person liable,

01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:56.709
at least not me,
and most people I know,

01:27:56.744 --> 01:28:00.872
and I had no choice in
my mind except to resign.

01:28:00.907 --> 01:28:03.160
Based on the research
that I did throughout

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:05.211
the year 2000
and that I'm still doing,

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:07.040
I have not found that law.

01:28:07.075 --> 01:28:09.530
I've asked Congress,
a lot of people,

01:28:09.565 --> 01:28:11.486
we've asked the
IRS Commissioner's helpers,

01:28:12.027 --> 01:28:14.060
they can't answer,
because if they answer,

01:28:14.061 --> 01:28:17.450
the American people are gonna know
that this whole thing is a fraud.

01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:22.265
I haven't filed a federal income
tax return since I left.

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.723
I have not filed a
tax return since 1999.

01:28:24.758 --> 01:28:29.459
The income tax is nothing less than
the enslavement of the entire country.

01:28:30.295 --> 01:28:34.934
Now, the control of the economy
and the perpetual robbery of wealth

01:28:34.969 --> 01:28:38.303
is only one side of the Rubik's Cube
the bankers hold in their hands.

01:28:38.338 --> 01:28:41.967
The next tool
for profit and control is war.

01:28:43.612 --> 01:28:45.859
Since the inception of the
Federal Reserve in 1913,

01:28:45.894 --> 01:28:48.862
a number of large and
small wars have commenced.

01:28:48.897 --> 01:28:52.813
The 3 most pronounced were
World War I, World War II, and Vietnam.

01:28:53.865 --> 01:28:55.049
World War I.

01:28:55.084 --> 01:28:59.540
In 1914, European wars broke out
centered around England and Germany.

01:28:59.575 --> 01:29:02.212
The American public wanted
nothing to do with the war,

01:29:02.247 --> 01:29:05.163
in turn President Wilson
publicly declared neutrality.

01:29:05.364 --> 01:29:07.430
However, under the surface,

01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:10.668
the US administration was looking for
any excuse they could find to enter it.

01:29:10.837 --> 01:29:14.834
In a noted observation by
Secretary of State William Jennings:

01:29:14.869 --> 01:29:18.190
"The large banking interests were
deeply interested in the World War,

01:29:18.225 --> 01:29:19.909
because of the wide opportunities
for large profits."

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:23.978
It's important to understand
that the most lucrative thing

01:29:23.979 --> 01:29:26.763
that can happen for
international bankers, is war.

01:29:26.798 --> 01:29:29.617
For it forces the county
to borrow even more money

01:29:29.652 --> 01:29:31.420
from the Federal Reserve Bank,
at interest.

01:29:31.993 --> 01:29:36.980
Woodrow Wilson's top adviser
and mentor was Colonel Edward House,

01:29:37.015 --> 01:29:38.988
a man with
intimate connections with

01:29:39.023 --> 01:29:41.353
the international bankers
who wanted in the war.

01:29:41.388 --> 01:29:45.647
In a documented conversation between
Colonel House, Wilson's Advisor,

01:29:45.682 --> 01:29:48.282
and Sir Edward Grey,
The Foreign Secretary of England,

01:29:48.317 --> 01:29:50.521
regarding how to get America
into the war.

01:29:50.556 --> 01:29:52.138
Grey inquired:

01:29:52.173 --> 01:29:54.943
"What will Americans do if Germans
sink an Ocean Liner

01:29:54.978 --> 01:29:56.500
with American passengers
on board?"

01:29:56.535 --> 01:29:57.905
House responded:

01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:01.419
"I believe that a flame of indignation
would sweep the United States

01:30:01.454 --> 01:30:04.488
and that by itself would be
sufficient to carry us into war."

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.656
So, on May 7th 1915 on essentially
the suggestion of Sir Edward Grey,

01:30:10.691 --> 01:30:13.316
a ship called the Lusitania
was deliberately sent

01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:15.083
into German controlled waters

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:17.458
where German
military vessels were know to be.

01:30:17.493 --> 01:30:21.012
And, as expected,
German U-boats torpedoed the ship,

01:30:21.047 --> 01:30:24.686
exploding stored ammunition,
killing 1200 people.

01:30:26.852 --> 01:30:30.134
To further understand the
deliberate nature of this setup,

01:30:30.169 --> 01:30:33.899
the German Embassy actually put
advertisements in the New York Times,

01:30:33.934 --> 01:30:36.244
telling people that if
they boarded the Lusitania,

01:30:36.279 --> 01:30:37.898
they did so
at their own risk,

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:40.282
as such a ship sailing
from America to England

01:30:40.317 --> 01:30:42.621
through the war zone,
would be liable to destruction.

01:30:42.656 --> 01:30:46.486
In turn and as anticipated,
the sinking of the Lusitania

01:30:46.521 --> 01:30:49.276
caused a wave of anger
among the American population

01:30:49.311 --> 01:30:52.383
and America entered the
war a short time after.

01:30:54.098 --> 01:30:58.249
The 1st World War caused
323,000 American deaths.

01:30:59.684 --> 01:31:02.549
J.D. Rockefeller made
200 million dollars off of it.

01:31:03.588 --> 01:31:07.080
Not to mention the war cost about
30 billion dollars for America,

01:31:07.425 --> 01:31:11.448
most of which was borrow from the
Federal Reserve Bank at interest,

01:31:11.483 --> 01:31:14.116
furthering the profits of
the international bankers.

01:31:14.898 --> 01:31:16.174
World War 2.

01:31:16.209 --> 01:31:20.963
On December 7th 1941, Japan attacked
the American fleet at Pearl Harbor,

01:31:20.998 --> 01:31:22.101
triggering our entry
into that war.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.535
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
declared that

01:31:25.570 --> 01:31:28.093
the attack was a
"day that will live in infamy".

01:31:28.128 --> 01:31:29.828
A day of infamy indeed,

01:31:29.863 --> 01:31:32.771
but not because of the alleged
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

01:31:33.002 --> 01:31:36.897
After 60 years of surfacing information,
it is clear that not only

01:31:36.932 --> 01:31:39.599
was the attack on Pearl Harbor
known weeks in advance,

01:31:39.634 --> 01:31:42.309
it was outright wanted
and provoked.

01:31:42.344 --> 01:31:46.441
Roosevelt, whose family had been
New York bankers since the 18th century,

01:31:46.476 --> 01:31:49.430
whose uncle Fredrik was on the
original Federal Reserve Board,

01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:52.926
was very sympathetic to the
interests of the international bankers

01:31:52.961 --> 01:31:55.226
and the interest
was to enter the war.

01:31:55.261 --> 01:31:57.664
And as we have seen,
nothing is more profitable

01:31:57.699 --> 01:31:59.634
for international bankers,
than war.

01:31:59.669 --> 01:32:02.660
In a journal entry,
by Roosevelt's Secretary of War

01:32:02.695 --> 01:32:06.282
Henry Stimson,
dated November 25th, 1941,

01:32:06.317 --> 01:32:08.806
he documented a conversation
he had with Roosevelt:

01:32:08.841 --> 01:32:12.332
"The question was how should we maneuver
them into firing the first shot.

01:32:12.367 --> 01:32:15.786
It was desirable to make sure the
Japanese be the ones to do this

01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:19.259
so that there should remain no doubt
as to who were the aggressors."

01:32:19.294 --> 01:32:22.020
In the months leading up to
the attack on Pearl Harbor,

01:32:22.055 --> 01:32:25.723
Roosevelt did everything
in his power to anger the Japanese,

01:32:25.758 --> 01:32:27.429
showing a posture
of aggression.

01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:29.505
He halted all of Japans' imports
of American Petroleum.

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:33.015
He froze all the Japanese assets
in the United States.

01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:35.458
He made public loans
to Nationalist China

01:32:35.493 --> 01:32:37.426
and supplied military aid
to the British,

01:32:37.461 --> 01:32:39.262
both enemies
to Japan in the war...

01:32:39.297 --> 01:32:43.078
Which, by the way, is completely in
violation of international war rules.

01:32:43.113 --> 01:32:45.629
And, on December 4th,
3 days before the attack,

01:32:45.664 --> 01:32:48.318
Australian Intelligence
told Roosevelt about

01:32:48.353 --> 01:32:51.851
a Japanese task force
moving towards Pearl Harbor.

01:32:51.886 --> 01:32:53.094
Roosevelt ignored it.

01:32:53.129 --> 01:32:57.086
So, as hoped and allowed,
on December 7th 1941,

01:32:57.121 --> 01:33:00.267
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,
killing 2400 soldiers.

01:33:00.302 --> 01:33:03.794
Before Pearl Harbor,
83% of the American public

01:33:03.829 --> 01:33:05.009
wanted nothing
to do with the war.

01:33:05.044 --> 01:33:08.409
After Pearl Harbor, 1 million men
volunteered for the war.

01:33:10.399 --> 01:33:13.509
It is important to note,
Nazi Germany's war effort

01:33:13.544 --> 01:33:16.261
was largely supported
by two organizations,

01:33:16.296 --> 01:33:18.112
one of which
was called I.G. Farben.

01:33:18.147 --> 01:33:22.696
I.G. Farben produced 84% of Germany's
explosives and even the Zyklon B

01:33:22.731 --> 01:33:24.793
used in the concentration camps
to kill millions.

01:33:25.104 --> 01:33:27.920
One of the unspoken partners
of I.G. Farben was

01:33:27.955 --> 01:33:31.353
J.D. Rockefeller's
Standard Oil Company in America,

01:33:31.388 --> 01:33:33.749
In fact, the German Air Force
could not operate without

01:33:33.784 --> 01:33:36.737
a special additive patterned
by Rockefeller's Standard Oil.

01:33:36.772 --> 01:33:40.343
The drastic bombing of London
by Nazi Germany, for example,

01:33:40.378 --> 01:33:43.543
was made possible by a 20
million dollar sale of fuel

01:33:43.578 --> 01:33:46.638
to I.G. Farben by the
Rockefeller Standard Oil Company.

01:33:46.673 --> 01:33:48.823
This is just one small point
about how

01:33:48.824 --> 01:33:51.656
American business funded
both sides of World War 2.

01:33:51.896 --> 01:33:54.615
One other treasonous organization
worth mentioning

01:33:54.616 --> 01:33:58.101
is the Union Banking Corporation
of New York City.

01:33:58.136 --> 01:34:01.703
Not only did it finance numerous
aspects of Hitler's rise to power,

01:34:01.738 --> 01:34:03.950
along with actual
materials during the war,

01:34:03.985 --> 01:34:06.423
it was also a Nazi
money laundering bank,

01:34:06.458 --> 01:34:07.926
which was eventually exposed
for having

01:34:07.927 --> 01:34:10.542
millions of dollars
of Nazi Money in its vaults.

01:34:10.577 --> 01:34:13.358
The Union Banking Corporation
of New York was eventually

01:34:13.393 --> 01:34:16.430
seized for violation of the
Trading with the Enemy Act.

01:34:16.465 --> 01:34:19.409
Guess who the director and
vice-president of the Union Bank was?

01:34:20.124 --> 01:34:23.523
Prescott Bush,
our current president's grandfather,

01:34:23.558 --> 01:34:25.289
and of course,
our former President's father.

01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:28.028
Keep that in mind,
when considering

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:30.785
the moral and political
dispositions of the Bush family.

01:34:34.139 --> 01:34:34.972
Vietnam.

01:34:35.392 --> 01:34:39.959
The United States official declaration
of war on North Vietnam in 1964,

01:34:39.994 --> 01:34:44.036
came after an alleged incident involving
two US destroyers being attacked

01:34:44.071 --> 01:34:47.710
by North Vietnamese
PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.

01:34:47.745 --> 01:34:49.999
This was known as the
Gulf of Tonkin Incident.

01:34:50.034 --> 01:34:53.358
This single situation
was the catalystic pretext

01:34:53.393 --> 01:34:55.625
for massive troop deployment
and full fledged warfare.

01:34:56.296 --> 01:34:58.051
One problem however.

01:34:58.086 --> 01:35:01.873
The attack on the US destroyers
by Vietnamese PT boats...

01:35:01.908 --> 01:35:03.228
never happened.

01:35:03.263 --> 01:35:07.635
It was a completely staged event
to have an excuse to enter the war.

01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:11.247
Former Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara, stated years later

01:35:11.282 --> 01:35:14.055
that the Gulf of Tonkin incident
was a "mistake",

01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:16.946
while many other insiders
and officers have come forward

01:35:16.981 --> 01:35:20.420
relaying that it was a contrived farce,
a complete lie.

01:35:20.623 --> 01:35:23.574
Once in the war,
it was business as usual.

01:35:23.609 --> 01:35:26.299
In October 1966,
President Lyndon Johnson

01:35:26.334 --> 01:35:28.717
lifted trading restrictions
on the Soviet Block,

01:35:28.752 --> 01:35:31.030
knowing full well that the Soviets
were providing

01:35:31.031 --> 01:35:34.074
upwards of 80% of
North Vietnam's war supplies.

01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:38.606
Consequently, Rockefeller interests
financed factories in the Soviet Union,

01:35:38.641 --> 01:35:40.893
which the Soviets
used to manufacture

01:35:40.928 --> 01:35:43.041
military equipment and
send to North Vietnam.

01:35:43.450 --> 01:35:45.414
However, the funding
of both sides of

01:35:45.415 --> 01:35:48.091
this conflict was only
one side of the coin.

01:35:48.126 --> 01:35:51.913
In 1985, Vietnam's Rules of Engagement
were declassified.

01:35:52.155 --> 01:35:55.921
This detailed what American troops were
and were not allow to do in the war.

01:35:56.159 --> 01:35:58.357
It included absurdities like:

01:35:58.392 --> 01:36:02.016
North Vietnamese anti-aircraft
missile systems could not be bombed

01:36:02.051 --> 01:36:04.234
until they were known
to be fully operational.

01:36:04.402 --> 01:36:08.394
No enemy could be pursued once they
crossed the border of Laos or Cambodia.

01:36:08.605 --> 01:36:11.751
And most revealing of all,
the most critical,

01:36:11.786 --> 01:36:14.275
strategic targets were
not allowed to be attacked,

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.412
unless initiated by
high military officials.

01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.584
Apart from
these imposed limitations,

01:36:19.619 --> 01:36:23.017
North Vietnam was informed
of these restrictions

01:36:23.052 --> 01:36:25.395
and therefore could create
entire strategies

01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:27.467
around the limitations
of the American Forces.

01:36:27.502 --> 01:36:31.153
This is why the war went on so long
and the bottom line is this:

01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:34.356
The Vietnam War
was never meant to be won...

01:36:34.391 --> 01:36:36.194
Just sustained.

01:36:36.401 --> 01:36:40.305
This war for profit resulted in
58,000 American deaths

01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:46.852
and 3 million
dead Vietnamese.

01:36:46.887 --> 01:36:49.275
So, where are we now.

01:36:49.648 --> 01:36:52.599
September 11th was the jumpstart
for what is now

01:36:52.634 --> 01:36:54.813
an accelerating agenda
by the ruthless elite.

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.170
It was
a staged war pretext,

01:36:57.171 --> 01:36:59.321
no different than the
sinking of the Lusitania,

01:36:59.492 --> 01:37:02.590
the provoking of Pearl Harbor
and the Gulf of Tonkin lie.

01:37:02.625 --> 01:37:06.061
In fact if 9/11 wasn't
a planned war pretext,

01:37:06.096 --> 01:37:07.800
it would be an exception
to the rule.

01:37:07.967 --> 01:37:11.839
It has been used to launch
two unprovoked illegal wars.

01:37:11.874 --> 01:37:14.305
One against Iraq and
one against Afghanistan.

01:37:14.608 --> 01:37:17.371
However, 9/11 was the pretext
for another war as well.

01:37:18.019 --> 01:37:18.874
The war against you.

01:37:19.045 --> 01:37:21.398
The Patriot Act,
Homeland Security,

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.463
the Military Tribunals Act
and other legislations,

01:37:24.498 --> 01:37:28.582
are all completely and entirely designed
to destroy your civil liberties

01:37:28.617 --> 01:37:31.620
and limit your ability to fight back
against what is coming.

01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:33.976
Currently
in the United States,

01:37:33.977 --> 01:37:36.348
unannounced to most
brainwashed Americans,

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:38.732
your home can be searched
without a warrant,

01:37:38.767 --> 01:37:40.228
without you being home,

01:37:40.263 --> 01:37:43.486
you can, in turn, be arrested
with no charges revealed to you,

01:37:43.521 --> 01:37:47.768
detain indefinitely with no access
to a lawyer and legally tortured.

01:37:48.009 --> 01:37:51.945
All under the suspicion
that you might be a "terrorist".

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.148
If you need a painted picture of
what is happening in the country,

01:37:55.349 --> 01:37:57.716
let's recognize
how history repeats itself.

01:37:58.586 --> 01:38:03.517
In February 1933,
Hitler staged a false flag attack,

01:38:04.183 --> 01:38:07.023
burning down his own
German parliament building,

01:38:07.024 --> 01:38:10.289
the Reichstag,
and blamed it on communist terrorists.

01:38:10.499 --> 01:38:13.059
Within the next few weeks,
he passed the Enabling Act,

01:38:13.302 --> 01:38:16.436
which completely eradicated
the German Constitution

01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:18.039
destroying people's liberties.

01:38:18.074 --> 01:38:20.141
He then let
a series of preemptive wars

01:38:20.376 --> 01:38:22.700
all justified
to the German people as

01:38:22.779 --> 01:38:25.781
necessary to maintaining
"homeland security".

01:38:58.814 --> 01:39:01.213
Our enemy is a
radical network of terrorists

01:39:01.596 --> 01:39:04.809
and every government
that supports them.

01:39:07.325 --> 01:39:08.724
It's time to wake up.

01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:11.661
The people in power
go out of their way

01:39:11.896 --> 01:39:16.281
to make sure you are perpetually
mislead and manipulated.

01:39:16.316 --> 01:39:18.817
The majorities perception
of reality,

01:39:18.818 --> 01:39:21.668
especially in the political arena
is not their own.

01:39:21.907 --> 01:39:25.900
It is shrewdly imposed upon them,
without them even knowing it.

01:39:26.411 --> 01:39:29.752
For example, the public
at large actually believes

01:39:29.787 --> 01:39:31.371
the invasion of Iraq
is going badly,

01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:34.551
as sectarian violence
doesn't seem to stop.

01:39:34.753 --> 01:39:36.415
What the public fails to see,

01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:40.006
is that the destabilization
of Iraq is exactly

01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:42.026
what the people
behind the government want.

01:39:42.327 --> 01:39:45.956
This war is to be sustained,
so the region can be divided up,

01:39:46.164 --> 01:39:48.496
domination
of the oil maintained,

01:39:48.497 --> 01:39:51.290
continual profits reaped
for the defense contractors

01:39:51.325 --> 01:39:54.505
and most importantly,
permanent military bases established

01:39:54.774 --> 01:39:58.253
to be used as a launching pad
against other oil bearing,

01:39:58.288 --> 01:40:00.974
non-conforming countries,
such as Iran and Syria,

01:40:01.609 --> 01:40:03.114
For further implication,

01:40:03.155 --> 01:40:06.447
that the civil war and destabilization
is purely intentional--

01:40:06.482 --> 01:40:11.725
In 2005, 2 elite British SAS officers
were arrested by Iraq police

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.636
after being caught driving around
in their car shooting at civilians,

01:40:15.671 --> 01:40:17.829
while dressed up as Arabs.

01:40:17.997 --> 01:40:20.990
After being arrested and
taken to a jail in Basra,

01:40:21.235 --> 01:40:23.897
the British army immediately
requested the release of these men.

01:40:24.238 --> 01:40:28.283
When the Basra government refused,
British tanks came in

01:40:28.318 --> 01:40:32.040
and physically broke out the
men from the Basra prison.

01:40:32.546 --> 01:40:36.745
If you wish to destroy an area,
how do you do it?

01:40:36.918 --> 01:40:37.969
Well there are two ways:

01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:40.718
You can go in there and bomb it, and so
forth, but that is not very efficient.

01:40:41.289 --> 01:40:44.315
What you do is try to get the people
in that area to kill each other

01:40:44.559 --> 01:40:48.360
and to destroy there own territory,
their own farms.

01:40:48.564 --> 01:40:50.327
And that's what
has been done in that area.

01:40:50.565 --> 01:40:56.003
The way in which you destroy an
opponent is get him to destroy himself,

01:40:56.271 --> 01:40:58.398
by dividing his ranks
against one another.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.092
Then you feed both sides,

01:41:00.123 --> 01:41:02.997
you have agents feeding both sides,
inflaming both sides.

01:41:03.514 --> 01:41:04.677
And they kill each other off.

01:41:06.082 --> 01:41:09.882
And it's time that some of us
woke up to this reality.

01:41:10.086 --> 01:41:15.855
To understand that people who try to
maintain empires and create empires,

01:41:15.993 --> 01:41:20.828
do it by manipulating the people
they are trying to conquer.

01:41:21.231 --> 01:41:24.200
You might to ask yourself
why the entire culture

01:41:24.235 --> 01:41:28.572
is utterly saturated with
mass media entertainment from all sides,

01:41:28.771 --> 01:41:33.641
while the educational system in America
continues it stupefying downward slide

01:41:33.810 --> 01:41:36.193
since the US government
decided to take over

01:41:36.228 --> 01:41:38.251
and subsidize
the public school system.

01:41:40.083 --> 01:41:43.682
What your government pays for,
it gets.

01:41:44.155 --> 01:41:47.486
When we understand that,
then we look at

01:41:47.486 --> 01:41:51.391
government financed institutions
of education

01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:55.082
and see the kind of students
and the kind of education that is

01:41:55.083 --> 01:41:58.536
being turned out by these
government financed schools,

01:41:58.737 --> 01:42:03.730
logic will tell you that if what is
being turned out in those schools

01:42:03.908 --> 01:42:08.277
was not in accord with what the state
and the federal government wanted,

01:42:08.446 --> 01:42:11.313
then it would change it.

01:42:11.449 --> 01:42:15.716
The bottom line is that the government
is getting what they have ordered.

01:42:15.854 --> 01:42:21.527
They do not want
your children to be educated.

01:42:21.562 --> 01:42:25.395
They do not want you
to think too much.

01:42:25.631 --> 01:42:28.828
That is why our country
and our world has become

01:42:28.863 --> 01:42:31.596
so proliferated
with entertainments,

01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:37.971
mass media, television shows,
amusement parks, drugs, alcohol

01:42:38.210 --> 01:42:40.007
and every kind
of entertainment,

01:42:40.212 --> 01:42:43.512
to keep the human mind
entertained.

01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:46.455
So that you don't get
in the way of

01:42:46.476 --> 01:42:50.653
important people by
doing too much thinking.

01:42:50.957 --> 01:42:53.255
You had better wake up
and understand

01:42:53.426 --> 01:42:57.158
that there are people who are guiding
your life and you don't even know it."

01:42:57.498 --> 01:43:00.228
We are
in a lot of trouble!

01:43:00.901 --> 01:43:05.443
Because you people and
62 million other Americans

01:43:05.478 --> 01:43:07.071
are listening to me right now.

01:43:07.106 --> 01:43:10.808
Because less than 3 percent
of you people read books.

01:43:11.213 --> 01:43:15.979
Because less 15 percent
of you read newspapers.

01:43:16.117 --> 01:43:19.575
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.

01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.475
Right now there is a whole,
an entire generation

01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:24.959
that never knew anything

01:43:24.994 --> 01:43:26.223
that didn't come out
of this tube.

01:43:27.929 --> 01:43:32.025
This tube is the gospel,
the ultimate revelation.

01:43:32.267 --> 01:43:37.136
This tube can make or break
presidents, popes, prime ministers...

01:43:37.305 --> 01:43:41.001
This tube is the most
awesome goddamn force

01:43:41.036 --> 01:43:43.472
in the whole godless world
and woe is us,

01:43:43.679 --> 01:43:45.613
if it ever falls in the
hands of the wrong people.

01:43:45.748 --> 01:43:48.925
And when the largest company
in the world controls

01:43:49.018 --> 01:43:54.087
the most awesome goddamn propaganda
force in the whole godless world,

01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:58.488
who knows what shit will be
peddled for truth on this network!

01:43:58.694 --> 01:44:01.369
So you listen to me...
Listen to me:

01:44:01.404 --> 01:44:04.332
Television
is not the truth.

01:44:04.367 --> 01:44:06.739
Television is a
goddamned amusement park,

01:44:06.937 --> 01:44:09.536
television is a circus,
a carnival,

01:44:09.537 --> 01:44:12.285
a traveling troop of acrobats,
story tellers,

01:44:12.342 --> 01:44:13.890
dancers,
singers, jugglers,

01:44:13.919 --> 01:44:17.336
sideshow freaks,
lion tamers and football players.

01:44:17.548 --> 01:44:20.108
We are in the
boredom killing business!

01:44:20.317 --> 01:44:24.410
But you people sit there,
day after day, night after night,

01:44:24.445 --> 01:44:26.586
all ages, colors, creeds...

01:44:26.824 --> 01:44:28.689
We are all you know.

01:44:28.859 --> 01:44:31.555
You're beginning to believe
the illusions we are spinning here,

01:44:31.762 --> 01:44:33.776
you are beginning to think
the tube is reality

01:44:33.777 --> 01:44:35.522
and that your own lives
are unreal.

01:44:35.867 --> 01:44:37.979
You do
whatever the tube tells you.

01:44:38.103 --> 01:44:40.116
You dress like the tube,
you eat like the tube,

01:44:40.166 --> 01:44:43.239
you raise your children like the tube,
you even think like the tube...

01:44:43.275 --> 01:44:46.508
This is mass madness,
you maniacs.

01:44:46.978 --> 01:44:49.539
In God's name,
you people are the real thing.

01:44:49.748 --> 01:44:52.273
We are the illusion!

01:44:55.054 --> 01:44:57.579
The last thing the men
behind the curtain want

01:44:57.823 --> 01:45:01.588
is a conscious informed public,
capable of critical thinking.

01:45:01.993 --> 01:45:06.158
Which is why a continually fraudulent
zeitgeist is output via religion,

01:45:06.398 --> 01:45:09.231
the mass media,
and the educational system.

01:45:09.635 --> 01:45:12.832
They seek to keep you in
a distracted, naive bubble.

01:45:13.672 --> 01:45:16.266
And they are doing a
damn good job of it.

01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:21.374
In 2005, an arrangement between Canada,
Mexico and the United States was made.

01:45:21.781 --> 01:45:23.853
This arrangement,
unannounced to the public,

01:45:23.888 --> 01:45:25.395
unregulated by Congress,

01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:28.542
merges the United States,
Canada and Mexico

01:45:28.543 --> 01:45:31.654
into one entity,
erasing all borders.

01:45:32.393 --> 01:45:34.227
It's called
the North American Union.

01:45:34.262 --> 01:45:36.752
You might want to ask yourself
why you have never heard of this.

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:40.595
In fact, there is only one mainstream
reporter who has actually heard of,

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:42.632
and has had the courage
to cover this issue.

01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:46.336
The Bush Administration's
Open Borders Policy

01:45:46.371 --> 01:45:47.643
and its decision to ignore

01:45:47.683 --> 01:45:50.370
the enforcement of this country's
immigration laws

01:45:50.578 --> 01:45:52.808
is part
of a broader agenda.

01:45:53.114 --> 01:45:55.093
President Bush
signed a formal agreement

01:45:55.094 --> 01:45:57.073
that will end the United States,
as we know it.

01:45:57.585 --> 01:46:01.454
And he took the step without approval
from either the US Congress,

01:46:01.657 --> 01:46:03.476
or the people
of the United States.

01:46:04.093 --> 01:46:06.227
It's a deal that few
have even heard of.

01:46:06.395 --> 01:46:09.922
It's been done again,
by very few people, at the very top,

01:46:10.098 --> 01:46:12.062
on behalf
of the investment class.

01:46:12.113 --> 01:46:13.863
But the working class
of people,

01:46:14.502 --> 01:46:18.906
political officials across our country
from communities and cities,

01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:20.838
they don't know anything
about this.

01:46:21.276 --> 01:46:22.971
This isn't some trade agreement.

01:46:23.178 --> 01:46:25.942
It is a total removal of
sovereignty from these countries

01:46:26.181 --> 01:46:29.618
which will also result in a completely
new currency called the Amero.

01:46:29.919 --> 01:46:33.199
Apart from that, I think the one thing
that people who are

01:46:33.234 --> 01:46:35.311
dollar based need to focus on
is the Amero,

01:46:35.426 --> 01:46:37.435
that's the one thing that
nobody is talking about.

01:46:37.476 --> 01:46:39.437
I think it's going
to have a big impact on

01:46:39.477 --> 01:46:44.199
everybody's life in
Canada, the US and Mexico.

01:46:44.335 --> 01:46:47.963
The Amero is the proposed new currency
for the North American Community,

01:46:48.104 --> 01:46:51.904
which is being developed right now
between Canada the US and Mexico

01:46:52.075 --> 01:46:55.169
to make a borderless community,
much like the EU,

01:46:55.345 --> 01:46:58.684
and the Dollar, the Canadian Dollar
and the Mexican Peso

01:46:58.719 --> 01:46:59.838
will be replaced
by the Amero.

01:47:00.217 --> 01:47:02.692
By default of this agreement,
the American Constitution

01:47:02.727 --> 01:47:04.551
will eventually be obsolete.

01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:06.710
You would think that
a situation like this

01:47:06.741 --> 01:47:09.558
would be on the cover
of every major newspaper.

01:47:09.793 --> 01:47:12.592
That is until you realize that
the people behind this movement

01:47:12.897 --> 01:47:15.530
are the same people who are
behind the main stream media

01:47:15.565 --> 01:47:18.163
and you are not told what
you are not supposed to know.

01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:21.405
The North American Union is the
same concept as the European Union,

01:47:21.573 --> 01:47:24.132
the African Union and
the soon-to-be Asian Union

01:47:24.341 --> 01:47:26.435
and the same people
are behind all of them.

01:47:26.645 --> 01:47:28.876
And when the time is right,
the North American Union,

01:47:28.896 --> 01:47:32.147
the European Union, the African Union
and the Asian Union

01:47:32.187 --> 01:47:35.508
will be merged together,
forming the final stages of a plan

01:47:35.547 --> 01:47:39.289
these men have been working on
for over 60 years.

01:47:39.457 --> 01:47:42.018
A one world government.

01:48:40.288 --> 01:48:44.349
One bank, one army,
one center of power.

01:48:44.726 --> 01:48:47.222
And if we have learned
anything from history.

01:48:47.262 --> 01:48:53.399
It is that power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts absolutely.

01:48:53.602 --> 01:48:56.537
This is Aaron Russo,
a filmmaker and former politician.

01:48:57.139 --> 01:48:59.628
To his left is
Nicholas Rockefeller

01:48:59.678 --> 01:49:03.135
of the infamous Rockefeller
Banking and Business Dynasty.

01:49:03.378 --> 01:49:05.882
After maintaining a close
friendship with Nicholas Rockefeller,

01:49:05.912 --> 01:49:08.020
Aaron eventually
ended the relationship,

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.244
appalled by what he had learn about
the Rockefellers and their ambitions.

01:49:12.788 --> 01:49:17.184
I got a call one day from an attorney
I knew and she said:

01:49:17.224 --> 01:49:18.701
"Would you like to meet
one of the Rockefellers?"

01:49:19.232 --> 01:49:21.022
And I said:
"Sure I would love to."

01:49:21.231 --> 01:49:27.067
And we became friends and he began
to divulge a lot of things to me,

01:49:27.403 --> 01:49:29.098
so he said to me,
one night, he said:

01:49:29.272 --> 01:49:30.619
"There's going to be
an event, Aaron,

01:49:31.323 --> 01:49:34.939
and out of that event,
we are going to go into Afghanistan,

01:49:35.246 --> 01:49:37.976
so we can run pipelines
from the Caspian Sea,

01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:40.197
we are going to go into Iraq
to take the oil

01:49:40.198 --> 01:49:41.855
and establish a base
in the Middle East

01:49:41.894 --> 01:49:46.252
and we are gong to go into
Venezuela and get rid of Chavez."

01:49:46.656 --> 01:49:49.990
The first 2 they have accomplished,
Chavez they didn't accomplish.

01:49:50.261 --> 01:49:53.992
And he said: "You are going to see
guys going into caves looking for...

01:49:54.431 --> 01:49:58.333
looking for people they
are never going to find."

01:49:58.536 --> 01:50:01.739
He was laughing about the fact
that you have this war on Terror,

01:50:01.774 --> 01:50:03.605
and there is no real enemy.

01:50:03.842 --> 01:50:07.844
He was talking about how by having
this war on terror you can never win it,

01:50:07.879 --> 01:50:09.608
because it is
an eternal war,

01:50:09.658 --> 01:50:12.646
and so you can always keep
taking peoples liberties away.

01:50:12.818 --> 01:50:16.551
And I said: "How are you going to
convince people that this war is real?"

01:50:16.755 --> 01:50:20.776
And he said: "By the media, the media
can convince everybody that it's real."

01:50:20.811 --> 01:50:24.796
You just keep talking about things and
saying them over and over and over again

01:50:24.831 --> 01:50:26.730
and eventually,
people believe it.

01:50:26.932 --> 01:50:29.760
You know, they create the Federal
Reserve in 1913 through lies.

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.356
They create 9/11,

01:50:31.406 --> 01:50:33.342
which was another lie.

01:50:33.392 --> 01:50:37.857
Through 9/11, then you are fighting a war on
terror and all the sudden you go into Iraq,

01:50:38.111 --> 01:50:39.111
which was another lie,

01:50:39.162 --> 01:50:40.950
and now,
they are going to do Iran.

01:50:41.562 --> 01:50:43.221
It's all one thing
leading to another,

01:50:43.222 --> 01:50:44.881
leading to another,
leading to another...

01:50:44.985 --> 01:50:47.451
I would say to him:
"What are you doing this for?

01:50:47.621 --> 01:50:48.326
What's the point of this thing?

01:50:48.366 --> 01:50:50.195
You have all the money in the world
you would ever want,

01:50:50.196 --> 01:50:51.435
you have all the power,

01:50:51.475 --> 01:50:54.255
you're hurting people.
It's not a good thing."

01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:57.597
And he would say:
"What do you care about the people for?

01:50:57.632 --> 01:50:59.219
Take care of yourself and
take care of your family".

01:50:59.278 --> 01:51:03.122
And then I said:
"So what are the ultimate goals here?"

01:51:03.904 --> 01:51:06.226
He said:
"The ultimate goal is to get

01:51:06.275 --> 01:51:08.956
everyone in this world
chipped with an RFID chip.

01:51:09.289 --> 01:51:13.401
And have all money be on those chips
and have everything on those chips,

01:51:13.401 --> 01:51:16.673
and if anyone wants to protest
what we do or violate what we want,

01:51:16.724 --> 01:51:18.509
we can just
turn off their chip."

01:51:19.543 --> 01:51:21.006
That's right--
micro chipped.

01:51:21.066 --> 01:51:24.227
In 2005, Congress,
under the pretense of immigration

01:51:24.228 --> 01:51:27.389
control and the
so-called war on terrorism,

01:51:27.562 --> 01:51:31.685
passed the Real ID act,
under which it is projected by May 2008,

01:51:31.715 --> 01:51:35.367
you will be required to carry
around a Federal Identification card

01:51:35.417 --> 01:51:37.616
which includes on it
a scannable barcode

01:51:37.651 --> 01:51:38.880
with your personal information.

01:51:39.474 --> 01:51:42.375
However this barcode is
only an intermediary step,

01:51:42.577 --> 01:51:47.069
before the card is equipped with
a VeriChip RFID Tracking Module,

01:51:47.150 --> 01:51:51.080
which will use radio frequencies to
track your every move on the planet,

01:51:52.024 --> 01:51:53.980
If this sounds foreign to you,
please note

01:51:54.256 --> 01:51:58.921
that the RFID tracking chip is already
in all new American passports.

01:52:00.163 --> 01:52:02.354
And the final step
is the implanted chip,

01:52:02.404 --> 01:52:05.116
which many people have
already been manipulated

01:52:05.117 --> 01:52:06.940
into accepting
under different pretenses.

01:52:07.503 --> 01:52:11.987
We have a Florida family who are
really pioneers in a brave new world.

01:52:12.676 --> 01:52:14.676
They have volunteered
to be the first ever,

01:52:14.727 --> 01:52:17.976
to have microchip
identification devices

01:52:18.015 --> 01:52:19.921
implanted into their bodies.

01:52:20.483 --> 01:52:24.351
After 9/11, I was really concerned
with the security of my family.

01:52:27.224 --> 01:52:29.791
I wouldn't mind having something
planted permanently in my arm,

01:52:29.831 --> 01:52:31.991
that would identify me.

01:52:32.730 --> 01:52:36.356
In the end, everybody will be
locked into a monitored control grid,

01:52:36.396 --> 01:52:39.138
where every single action
you perform is documented,

01:52:39.178 --> 01:52:42.378
and if you get out of line,
they can just turn off your chip,

01:52:42.429 --> 01:52:45.090
for at that point in time,
every single aspect of society

01:52:45.119 --> 01:52:47.830
will revolve around
interactions with the chips.

01:52:48.612 --> 01:52:50.580
This is the picture
that is painted for the future

01:52:50.581 --> 01:52:51.936
if you open your eyes
to see it.

01:52:52.483 --> 01:52:55.106
A centralized one world economy,
where everyone's moves

01:52:55.146 --> 01:52:58.086
and everyone transactions
are tracked and monitored.

01:52:58.123 --> 01:52:59.577
All rights removed.

01:53:03.395 --> 01:53:05.156
The incredible aspect of all:

01:53:06.331 --> 01:53:09.699
These totalitarian elements
will not be forced upon the people,

01:53:09.936 --> 01:53:12.302
the people will demand them.

01:53:12.505 --> 01:53:15.838
For the social manipulation of society,
through the generation of fear

01:53:16.209 --> 01:53:18.264
and division has completely
detached humans

01:53:18.295 --> 01:53:20.231
from their sense
of power and reality.

01:53:21.348 --> 01:53:23.748
A process, which has been going on
for centuries if not millennia...

01:53:23.950 --> 01:53:24.939
Religion.

01:53:25.151 --> 01:53:26.516
Patriotism.

01:53:26.586 --> 01:53:27.265
Race.

01:53:27.314 --> 01:53:28.289
Wealth.

01:53:28.319 --> 01:53:29.232
Class.

01:53:29.272 --> 01:53:30.906
And every other form
of arbitrary,

01:53:30.937 --> 01:53:33.686
separatist identification
and thus conceit,

01:53:33.736 --> 01:53:36.329
has served to create a
controlled population,

01:53:36.330 --> 01:53:38.695
utterly malleable
in the hands of the few.

01:53:39.521 --> 01:53:41.787
Divide and Conquer
is the motto,

01:53:41.828 --> 01:53:44.225
and as long as people continue
to see themselves

01:53:44.243 --> 01:53:46.002
as separate from everything else,

01:53:46.051 --> 01:53:48.768
they lend themselves to
being completely enslaved.

01:53:49.977 --> 01:53:53.045
The men behind the curtain know this.
And they also know,

01:53:53.214 --> 01:53:56.846
that if people ever realize the
truth of their relationship to nature,

01:53:56.846 --> 01:53:59.742
and the truth
of their personal power...

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.329
The entire manufactured
Zeitgeist they prey upon,

01:54:02.371 --> 01:54:04.787
will collapse
like a house of cards.

01:54:15.904 --> 01:54:23.024
The whole system that we live in,
drills into us that we are powerless,

01:54:23.059 --> 01:54:26.878
that we are weak, that society is evil,
that it's crime ridden and so forth.

01:54:26.882 --> 01:54:29.787
It is all a big fat lie!

01:54:29.822 --> 01:54:32.507
We are powerful,
beautiful, extraordinary.

01:54:33.761 --> 01:54:37.362
There is no reason
why we cannot understand

01:54:37.397 --> 01:54:40.212
who we truly are;
where we are going.

01:54:40.247 --> 01:54:44.549
There is no reason why the average
individual cannot be fully empowered.

01:54:44.584 --> 01:54:47.137
We are
incredibly powerful beings.

01:54:48.944 --> 01:54:51.069
I think
I spent 30 years of my life,

01:54:51.682 --> 01:54:54.158
the first 30,
trying to become something.

01:54:54.193 --> 01:54:56.248
I wanted to become
good at things,

01:54:56.288 --> 01:54:58.774
I wanted to become good
at tennis and school and grades.

01:54:58.915 --> 01:55:01.008
And everything I kinda
viewed in that perspective,

01:55:01.218 --> 01:55:04.313
I'm not okay the way I am,
but if I got good at things...

01:55:05.022 --> 01:55:07.319
I realized that
I had the game wrong.

01:55:07.591 --> 01:55:10.788
Because the game was to
find out what I already was.

01:55:33.118 --> 01:55:38.150
Now, in our culture we have been trained
for individual differences to stand out.

01:55:38.185 --> 01:55:40.516
So you look at each person
and the immediate hit is.

01:55:40.692 --> 01:55:44.061
Brighter, dumber, older,
younger, richer, poorer...

01:55:44.096 --> 01:55:46.960
And we make all these
dimensional distinctions,

01:55:46.995 --> 01:55:48.957
put them in categories
and treat them that way.

01:55:48.992 --> 01:55:53.092
And get so we only see others
as separate from ourselves

01:55:53.127 --> 01:55:54.808
in the ways
in which they are separate.

01:55:55.173 --> 01:55:59.685
And one of the dramatic
characteristics of experience

01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.608
is being with another person
and suddenly seeing

01:56:01.781 --> 01:56:05.292
the ways in which they are like you,
not different from you.

01:56:05.327 --> 01:56:08.835
And experiencing the fact
that which is essence in you,

01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:11.163
which is essence in me,
is indeed, One.

01:56:11.198 --> 01:56:15.190
The understanding that there
is no other. It is all One.

01:56:19.232 --> 01:56:22.360
I wasn't born Richard Albert,
I was just born as a human being

01:56:22.602 --> 01:56:26.582
and then I learned
this whole business of who I am,

01:56:26.617 --> 01:56:30.165
and whether I'm good or bad,
or achieving or not...

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:31.721
All that's learned
along the way.

01:56:47.662 --> 01:56:52.725
The old appeals to racial,
sexual and religious shovanism,

01:56:52.968 --> 01:56:55.697
to rabid nationalistic fervor,

01:56:56.003 --> 01:56:57.938
are beginning
not to work.

01:56:58.173 --> 01:57:03.829
A new consciousness is developing which
sees the earth as a single organism,

01:57:03.864 --> 01:57:09.491
and recognizes, that an organism
at war with itself is doomed.

01:57:41.184 --> 01:57:44.483
Bill Hicks
used to finish his shows

01:57:44.755 --> 01:57:46.814
with this:

01:57:48.492 --> 01:57:51.620
Life's like a ride
in an amusement park,

01:57:51.795 --> 01:57:54.192
and when you go on it,
you think it's real

01:57:54.227 --> 01:57:55.935
because that's how powerful
our minds are.

01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:59.338
The ride goes up and down
and round and round,

01:57:59.373 --> 01:58:01.794
it has thrills and chills
and it's very brightly colored.

01:58:01.829 --> 01:58:05.197
And it's very loud and
it's fun for a while.

01:58:05.475 --> 01:58:08.951
Some have been on the ride for a
long time and they begin to question:

01:58:08.986 --> 01:58:11.211
Is this real?
Or is this just a ride?

01:58:11.783 --> 01:58:15.464
And other people have remembered and
they come back to us and they say:

01:58:15.499 --> 01:58:17.652
'Hey, don't worry,
don't be afraid ever.

01:58:18.089 --> 01:58:19.909
Cause this is just a ride.'

01:58:21.225 --> 01:58:23.312
And we kill those people.

01:58:23.829 --> 01:58:27.306
Shut him up, I have got a lot
invested in this ride, shut him up!

01:58:28.165 --> 01:58:29.700
Look at my frowns of worry...

01:58:29.735 --> 01:58:32.159
Look at my big bank account
and my family...

01:58:32.194 --> 01:58:33.162
This has to be real...

01:58:34.039 --> 01:58:35.768
It's just a ride.

01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:38.681
But we always kill those good guys
who try and tell us that,

01:58:38.716 --> 01:58:39.204
you ever notice that?

01:58:39.279 --> 01:58:41.508
And we let the demons
run a muck...

01:58:42.047 --> 01:58:44.777
But it doesn't matter,
because it is just a ride

01:58:44.983 --> 01:58:47.211
and we can change it
anytime we want.

01:58:47.486 --> 01:58:49.019
It is only a choice.

01:58:49.054 --> 01:58:52.187
No effort, no work, no job,
no savings of money.

01:58:52.392 --> 01:58:54.476
Just a choice right now.

01:58:54.928 --> 01:58:56.543
Between fear,

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:59.274
and love.
