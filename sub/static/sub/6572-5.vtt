00:02.068 --> 00:05.401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.853
<i>Michael had snuck out
of work to see a British film...</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:25.516
<i>with his British girlfriend, Rita.</i>

00:25.625 --> 00:27.650
I hate it when they hire
Yanks to play Brits.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.353
You can always tell.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.862
<i>When they came upon a toy store.</i>

00:31.965 --> 00:34.957
We should get George Michael one
of these.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.968
Oh, no, that-that-that's
not really him.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.766
Besides, I already got him his
big present for his birthday.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.534
A suit!
Dad, it's a Jack Welch.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.940
I want you to look
under the pants.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.037
Quicken! Premier. Dad,
I hope you kept the receipt.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.412
- You wanna return that?
- No, I wanna deduct it.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.812
Come on, let's get him the train.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.889
It's... Really, he would
only like it for the receipt.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.981
And this is crazy. I-I really...

00:59.092 --> 01:00.992
I can't be seeing movies in the afternoon,
then going to toy stores.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.994
I have to work. I'm not
even supposed to be here.

01:03.096 --> 01:06.293
<i>Michael couldn't
tear himself away.</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:09.493
<i>- Could you?</i>
- I can't promise it'll be fun.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.233
Okay, that's, uh,
that wa... that was fun.

01:17.343 --> 01:21.541
Still, the land probably shouldn't have
given out beneath us.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.582
But we got a mole problem.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.583
A mole problem?

01:25.685 --> 01:27.585
Yeah, they've undermined
this whole hill.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.814
We won't be able to build on it
for a few months. But it's my fault.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.017
This is exactly why I should have been coming
to work. The Japanese backers...

01:33.126 --> 01:35.356
if they find out about this...
that we haven't started building...

01:35.462 --> 01:38.659
- they might not come through with
their investments. - I won't tattle.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.928
I really fancy you.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.026
I fancy you too.

01:44.137 --> 01:48.096
<i>Michael was falling for Rita.</i>

01:48.208 --> 01:51.803
- Whee!
<i>- And Rita was falling for Michael too.</i>

01:51.911 --> 01:55.176
<i>But that wasn't part of the plan.</i>

01:55.281 --> 01:57.715
Rita, you've dirt on your face.

01:57.817 --> 02:02.015
- It's from school.
- I called the school, and you weren't there.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.113
You know, we're here to learn
things, not fall in love.

02:04.224 --> 02:08.820
So what if I have?
I've got feelings, all right?

02:08.928 --> 02:12.125
I'm a woman too! Not some robot
you get to tell everything to.

02:12.232 --> 02:15.633
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of it all!

02:15.735 --> 02:18.363
Your instructions and your letters!

02:18.471 --> 02:21.998
And your little missions.
And your stupid assignments.

02:22.108 --> 02:25.407
"You do the math, Rita."
Well, no, you do the math.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.707
- Oh, God.
- Do you remember this?

02:27.814 --> 02:30.806
And the pledge that you made
when you were promised it?

02:30.917 --> 02:34.148
- I said I'd do anything for it.
- I want him out of the picture.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.688
- Can you do that?
- I'm a big girl.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.021
<i>And Michael returned
home as well.</i>

02:46.132 --> 02:48.828
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Oh, I got highlights.

02:48.935 --> 02:53.133
- It'll blend in about a week.
- Here. Yeah, I actually meant the collapse.

02:53.239 --> 02:57.335
It probably has something to do with
the 4,000 hair plugs I had in one sitting.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.502
Well, maybe you oughta
see a doctor.

02:59.612 --> 03:02.638
Yeah, but he's too busy going to the gym
to see his friend Frank.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.718
Oh, we're more than friends.
I'm kind of his spotter.

03:05.818 --> 03:11.017
Missed a spot. Anyway, we should be looking
at some big yen coming in from the Japanese.

03:11.124 --> 03:14.423
And when it does, I'm taking
my gym buddy out to dinner.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.461
I barely even know you.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.896
- Who's Frank?
- I've been wanting to talk to you about that...

03:19.999 --> 03:23.196
- but it's a little awkward.
- Oh, well.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.635
I've been wanting to have
my own awkward talk as well.

03:25.738 --> 03:29.265
I think we can be more
than just gym buddies.

03:29.375 --> 03:35.007
- You're blowing my mind, Frank.
- I'm an agent, and I'd like to work with you.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.309
Oh. Oh!

03:37.417 --> 03:39.612
Well, that is great news.
Okay, good.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.244
I'm so glad you went first.
Uh, uh what agency are you with?

03:42.355 --> 03:48.157
<i>Frank said CIA, a government agency
that was responsible for this catastrophe.</i>

03:48.261 --> 03:53.893
<i>But Tobias thought he said CAA, a talent
agency that was responsible for this one.</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:57.128
Frank's in the business, Michael.
He's got a big project for me.

03:57.237 --> 04:01.264
Says it's "top secret."
He kind of looks like you. Same size.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.775
- Same curly hair.
- Tobias, maybe you should spend less time...

04:04.877 --> 04:08.005
focused on your looks, and more time
focused on your daughter, okay?

04:08.114 --> 04:10.378
Her grades are terrible.
She's gonna start getting F's.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.474
<i>Actually, she'd
already gotten one...</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:18.113
<i>as the movie she'd released in her secret
life as a studio executive was losing money.</i>

04:18.224 --> 04:20.658
<i>But Maeby had a way to fix that.</i>

04:20.760 --> 04:23.092
- We turn it into a ride.
- A ride.

04:23.196 --> 04:26.427
On the studio tour.
What used to be the Hell Tunnel...

04:26.532 --> 04:30.628
now becomes the Tunnel
of <i>Love, Indubitably.</i>

04:30.737 --> 04:34.138
- But didn't some people die in Hell Tunnel?
- That is an urban legend.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.674
Two elderly people
got badly scalded...

04:36.776 --> 04:41.213
when they tried to climb into the lava
cauldron, but I've got that covered.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.282
Just like the poster!

04:43.383 --> 04:47.114
Grades like those, she's gonna be taking
tickets at a movie theater the rest of her life.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.383
You know what, you're one to talk.
You've completely ignored this family...

04:50.490 --> 04:52.458
since that British bird
flew into your life.

04:52.558 --> 04:56.927
No, I haven't. Well, maybe a little.
But, you know, she's amazing.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.964
- You know, she was in the Olympics?
<i>- She wasn't.</i>

04:59.065 --> 05:00.965
She's that Rita Leeds?

05:01.067 --> 05:02.967
- Wasn't she on the cover of Newsweek?
<i>- No.</i>

05:03.069 --> 05:06.470
- Yes.
<i>- Michael was thinking of this man.</i>

05:06.572 --> 05:09.973
She even plays the banjo. Although,
I do have to spend more time at work.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.237
I was at the property
the Japanese funded today.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.643
The whole backside has moles.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.841
That's Frank's problem too.

05:17.950 --> 05:22.387
<i>Later that day, Michael went into
the office to find the rest of his family.</i>

05:22.488 --> 05:25.389
Well, look who's finally gracing us
with his presence.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.153
- What's the surrogate doing here?
- We're meeting with the lawyers.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.525
So I've hired this guy
to be my eyes and ears.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.758
<i>- You know, Dad, this guy costs us a fortune.</i>
- He's worth every penny.

05:33.866 --> 05:36.494
- Hey, I didn't say that.
- Oh, Michael.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.194
- Mr. Loblaw.
- I'll catch you up.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.238
- The Japanese are coming.
- They are?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.865
Somebody tipped them off that
the property wasn't ready for building.

05:42.975 --> 05:47.002
Which it would have been if Michael hadn't
been so busy with his English muffin.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.910
- Typical.
- Delicious.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.245
- I need a drink.
- I'll take an English muffin.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.115
We'll have to be honest
with these Japanese investors.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.246
They, uh, come from a culture
that values honor and respect.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.351
And Godzilla!

06:02.462 --> 06:04.123
<i>- Godzirra!</i>
- Just sit down.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.596
- Okay, guys.
<i>- Godzirra!</i>

06:09.102 --> 06:11.764
This needs to stop now!

06:11.871 --> 06:13.930
Okay, this is exactly what we shouldn't do
when they show up.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.031
Mom! That's enough.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.610
- What? We're out of vodka.
- Sorry.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.202
I thought you were doing Godzilla.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.908
- Mom, that's enough.
- What? I'm laughing.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.381
- Oh.
- Hey, maybe that's it.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.283
Maybe we should do to the Japanese
what they do in their movies.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.549
Build a miniature city.
Put it outside their window.

06:30.656 --> 06:35.389
Tell them it's far away. It'll look real
if you squint. God knows they're squinters.

06:35.495 --> 06:39.727
What do you think, Dad?
A whole..."Tiny Town."

06:39.832 --> 06:43.233
- Another brilliant idea, Einstein.
- Really?

06:43.336 --> 06:48.672
- You like to build it with me?
- Larry really never knows how to sell the sarcasm.

06:48.775 --> 06:52.802
- It's a stupid idea.
- Uh. I'll build it with you, Gob.

06:52.912 --> 06:56.313
Oh, great. That's another
brilliant idea, Steinberg.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.510
I agree with Michael. If you take money
from these people under false pretenses...

06:59.619 --> 07:01.519
you'll be committing fraud.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.646
The government's already
watching your father closely.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.987
They're going through his mail. They want
to put your father in prison for good.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.584
Yeah, Bob's right. We've got to start
thinking practically.

07:09.695 --> 07:13.062
Life is not some cheesy Japanese movie...

07:13.166 --> 07:15.259
where the hero pulls on
a pair of jet pants and...

07:15.368 --> 07:17.632
flies off the balcony like Astroboy.

07:17.737 --> 07:23.039
And that's when George Sr. Did
a Web search for the words, "Jet pants."

07:23.142 --> 07:26.441
- Even better.
- The bigger problem is, who alerted the Japanese?

07:26.546 --> 07:29.276
I think you might have a spy.
This room, or someone in it...

07:29.382 --> 07:31.441
might even be wired
with a listening device.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.389
You need to find
that leak and plug it.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.890
Your father said that he was
set up by a British syndicate.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.960
Maybe you should look
for somebody English.

07:44.061 --> 07:45.497
What?

07:45.598 --> 07:48.692
I think Michael's
already plugged our leak.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.634
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You've been spending a lot of time with Rita.

07:51.737 --> 07:54.706
- And she's "Britishish."
- She's a spy.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.607
- I haven't told Rita anything.
<i>- This was not strictly true.</i>

07:58.711 --> 08:01.077
Let's start with
my family's misdemeanors...

08:01.180 --> 08:03.648
and then push right on through
to the lighter treasons.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.718
The Japanese backers... if they find out
that we haven't started building...

08:06.819 --> 08:08.980
they might not come through
with their investments.

08:09.088 --> 08:13.081
Then he siphoned off the entire pension
fund into a dummy corporation...

08:13.192 --> 08:16.218
filed for bankruptcy, and used...
Do you know any other songs?

08:16.329 --> 08:19.389
- She's a spy!
- Rita is not a spy, okay?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.558
She's a beautiful, elegant woman.
It doesn't make any sense.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.500
- What doesn't make any sense
is why she's dating you.
- No, that's a good point.

08:24.604 --> 08:28.540
Actually, my sources tell me that
the leak goes by the name "Mr. F."

08:28.641 --> 08:31.201
Ah, <i>Mister</i> F. Rita's not a man.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.073
- As far as you know.
- And it could be an alias.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.616
<i>- Alias</i> is a show about a spy!
- All right, that's it!

08:37.717 --> 08:40.743
I finally find someone that I really care about,
my family tries to drive us apart.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.845
It's not gonna work. So you know what?
I got a switch for you.

08:43.956 --> 08:48.188
You guys handle this problem.
I am gonna go have some fun.

08:48.294 --> 08:51.695
Unbelievable. Deserting the family
when we most need him.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.425
- Shameful.
- Gob, I'm sending you a package.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.025
You'll know what to do with it.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.627
<i>Michael was upset, and he called Rita.</i>

08:59.739 --> 09:03.539
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, I've been thinking.</i>

09:03.643 --> 09:07.670
I'm going to start working less,
and I do want to start having more fun.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.975
So, I'd like to
take you out tomorrow.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.448
<i>All day, anywhere you want.
What do you say?</i>

09:12.552 --> 09:16.044
<i>Hell Tunnel takes another name.
Will it take another life?</i>

09:16.155 --> 09:19.056
Oh, I say yes.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.649
Only, I'm going
to take you out.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.025
<i>The next morning, Michael
was heading out for his day with Rita.</i>

09:30.136 --> 09:32.104
- George Michael.
- Hey, I love my present, Dad.

09:32.204 --> 09:35.139
- I'd wear it to school, but who needs
a Welch wedge, right? - Yeah.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.675
- That's when they... - Enough business.
In fact, I got you another present.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.405
It's something I saw yesterday
when I was out with Rita.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.845
- It's time for us to start having some fun.
- I don't know.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.144
"Fun" and "Failure"
both start out the same way.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.519
Let's just go ahead
and rip this down, huh?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.421
<i>And Larry, the surrogate...</i>

09:56.529 --> 10:00.863
<i>showed up to pick up the jet pack that
George Sr. Had sent to the model home.</i>

10:00.967 --> 10:03.629
What is that, a train set?
Look down, Larry.

10:03.736 --> 10:07.297
- No, not down at your feet.
- Left.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.432
- My left, your right.
- What is the matter with this guy?

10:10.543 --> 10:13.273
- And, let me guess, he's probably...
- saying all that too.

10:13.379 --> 10:17.975
It is a train set!
Those Japanese sites.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.310
- I'm never gonna find my way...
- past that hallway sensor.

10:21.420 --> 10:25.516
Dad, what are you doing here?
Is this the package you sent me?

10:27.159 --> 10:31.289
<i>Tiny Town. This is for
Tiny Town, isn't it?</i>

10:31.397 --> 10:33.957
<i>You did like my idea,
didn't you, Dad?</i>

10:34.066 --> 10:36.057
<i>I think he's in the can.</i>

10:36.168 --> 10:38.568
<i>Actually, George Sr. was in the kitchen...</i>

10:38.671 --> 10:42.232
<i>trying to soothe himself
with an ice cream sandwich.</i>

10:45.211 --> 10:49.648
<i>And that's when he discovered a way
to possibly slip by the sensors.</i>

10:49.749 --> 10:53.014
If mother sees this,
she will blow a cow.

10:57.189 --> 11:00.090
- Uh-oh.
- Dad?

11:01.927 --> 11:05.658
- Oh, cool, a train set.
- Oh, I've always wanted one of those.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.064
<i>Maybe we could build
our Tiny Town together.</i>

11:09.168 --> 11:11.363
<i>Do you want to, Dad?</i>

11:11.470 --> 11:13.938
<i>Buster had always wanted
to do the same with Gob.</i>

11:14.040 --> 11:17.373
Goody! Yeah.
I do want to.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.910
Yea. I do want to. Goody.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.948
<i>Gob was thrilled,
as was Buster.</i>

11:24.050 --> 11:28.612
<i>Only Larry was disappointed. But he was
such a pro you'd never know it.</i>

11:28.721 --> 11:33.749
<i>And back at the gym, Tobias was finding out
more about the project the agent had suggested.</i>

11:33.859 --> 11:36.851
Come on! What are you gonna tell me?
What've you got for me?

11:36.962 --> 11:40.363
The Japanese investors you told us about
are going over to your place today.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.594
I need you there when they are.
We need you to be a mole.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.002
Oh.
Kind of a backer's audition.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.404
Okay, I get it.
All right. Well then, Frank...

11:49.508 --> 11:53.911
I shall be a bigger, hairier mole than
the one on your inner left thigh.

11:55.481 --> 11:58.973
<i>And later, Michael and Rita were
on the Tantamount Studios tour.</i>

11:59.085 --> 12:02.054
The thing she doesn't understand about
bovine spongiform encephalitis is...

12:02.154 --> 12:04.588
Hold! Hold! The tram. Let's get
out of here, folks! Make some room!

12:04.690 --> 12:07.557
- Make some room!
- Look! It's <i>Malcolm in the Middle!</i>

12:07.660 --> 12:10.288
In the middle of shooting, I guess.

12:10.396 --> 12:14.560
Oh, that's okay. It's more important to show
how we make the show than actually make it.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.069
!@%$# Tantamount.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.434
- Hello?
<i>- They dropped off the package you sent...</i>

12:20.539 --> 12:22.439
<i>but I don't think
I'm old enough for it.</i>

12:22.541 --> 12:26.409
Of course you are. I want you to have
a little fun. You're not gonna break anything.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.948
<i>But of course, Michael
thought he was talking about the train set.</i>

12:30.049 --> 12:34.645
<i>Not the extremely dangerous jet pack
the boy had just found at the front door.</i>

12:34.754 --> 12:37.086
- Well, what if I crash it?
- That's half the fun.

12:38.858 --> 12:43.955
<i>And soon the tour arrived at the
Tunnel of</i> Love, Indubitably.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.294
<i>So take the hand of someone you love...</i>

12:47.399 --> 12:50.596
<i>as we enter the Tunnel of</i> Love, Indubitably.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.933
<i>...nnel of Hell.</i>

12:53.038 --> 12:57.304
<i>But Michael was happy
to hold the hand of someone he did love.</i>

12:57.409 --> 12:59.775
<i>And then,
he noticed her bracelet.</i>

13:06.519 --> 13:11.547
<i>Michael had just noticed that
Rita was wearing a suspicious bracelet.</i>

13:11.657 --> 13:15.058
- What does your bracelet say?
- Nothing.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.892
Oh, look. Look, there they are
on the bicycle made for two.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.694
It says Mr. F, doesn't it?
Who is he?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.133
Nobody.
I can't tell you!

13:24.236 --> 13:27.228
Oh, God. He followed us.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.967
<i>- But why?</i>
- Wait a minute. You know that man?

13:30.075 --> 13:32.805
It's not what you think it is.
It's my uncle.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.311
Is that Mr. F?
What does he want?

13:34.413 --> 13:36.313
He wants you out of the picture.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.645
- Bloody right I do.
- H-Hey!

13:38.751 --> 13:42.847
- Oh!
- You lied to me, Rita!

13:42.955 --> 13:45.480
You made me turn against my family.
But it's over now.

13:48.191 --> 13:50.223
Oh! Me !@%s are wet.

13:51.497 --> 13:55.399
<i>And Maeby received a call about
the latest lava cauldron accident.</i>

13:55.501 --> 13:57.662
Already?
It's only been an hour.

13:57.770 --> 14:01.001
I'm gonna lose this job. Maybe
I should let Mort take me out to dinner.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.870
- Maeby?
- Okay, I'm definitely gonna lose this job.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.342
- I can explain.
- Rita set me up. She set us all up.

14:06.445 --> 14:09.676
This beautiful, funny, brilliant woman
was a spy. Everybody was right.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.410
It was too good to be true.
And I... am turning her in.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.386
Let me tell you something else. I would not
want to be the next woman who tries to fool me.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.185
Well, that was a freebie.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.922
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
was trying to solve a mystery of his own.</i>

14:25.030 --> 14:26.930
<i>The jet pack...</i>

14:27.032 --> 14:32.368
<i>had come with an instructional DVD
that seemed to confuse more than clarify.</i>

14:32.471 --> 14:36.931
<i>What was clear was that
the gift was extremely dangerous.</i>

14:44.717 --> 14:49.017
<i>And it did seem like a lot of work...</i>

14:49.121 --> 14:51.954
<i>for a little payoff.</i>

14:52.057 --> 14:53.752
- Have fun!
- Have fun.

14:53.859 --> 14:57.590
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was bonding with the man
he thought his father was controlling.</i>

14:57.696 --> 15:01.632
- Almost done with the water tower.
- Neat-o.

15:01.734 --> 15:06.228
<i>His real father, however,
had gotten lost within the walls.</i>

15:06.338 --> 15:08.238
Where the hell am I?

15:08.340 --> 15:11.776
<i>He was actually somewhere between
the linen closet and the guest room.</i>

15:11.877 --> 15:14.072
<i>I'm really glad that we're doing this together.</i>

15:14.179 --> 15:18.639
<i>- I've never felt so close to you.</i>
- Oh! I feel the same way.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.187
- He's crying now.
- Oh, God, look at us.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.018
<i>We're like a couple of girls
on the last day of camp.</i>

15:27.526 --> 15:33.192
<i>Right outside the house, Tobias was working
with the man he thought was a talent agent.</i>

15:33.299 --> 15:36.132
- You ready?
- Oh, yes. I'm gonna be a great mole.

15:36.235 --> 15:39.170
Check, two, three.
"Let Lilly lick Lionel's lusty leathers.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.432
- Let Lilly lick Lionel's"...
- The levels are fine.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.269
- All right.
- Remember, no one can know it's you.

15:43.375 --> 15:47.141
- We need to capture George Sr.
- Capture George Sr.?

15:47.246 --> 15:50.613
- What... Is that what you hired me to do?
- You didn't realize that?

15:50.716 --> 15:55.210
No. But it does make perfect sense.
I have played him before.

15:55.321 --> 15:59.951
<i>He had, in the poorly narrated
reality series,</i> Scandalmakers.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.959
It's gonna be tough to work
that into the character...

16:02.061 --> 16:04.029
and it's going to fight
the costume I rented...

16:04.129 --> 16:07.895
but I didn't take six weeks of improv
classes at the Groundlings for nothing.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.300
<i>Michael was on the phone to Bob Loblaw.</i>

16:12.404 --> 16:14.338
I don't even think
she's here legally, all right?

16:14.440 --> 16:17.466
She's taken advantage of me.
I-I want you to take care of this.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.976
<i>Call the CIA, do whatever you have to do.</i>

16:20.079 --> 16:23.139
Fine, but you take care of your family.
I think they're going ahead with this hoax.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.513
And if money changes hands,
you're all going to jail.

16:26.618 --> 16:30.645
Well, unfortunately the roads are out, so we
can't take you up there to see it in person...

16:30.756 --> 16:33.725
but if you stand absolutely
still right there...

16:33.826 --> 16:37.387
and just squint in-into the light,
and behold, Sudden Hill!

16:37.496 --> 16:40.158
Gob! Don't!

16:40.265 --> 16:44.167
<i>It actually looked pretty
good. Even the financiers thought so.</i>

16:44.269 --> 16:48.399
<i>Ishiro said, "I am reassured.
And they treat us with respect this time. "</i>

16:48.507 --> 16:53.069
<i>Motoyoshi said, "I thought the woman
was pretending as a monster...</i>

16:53.178 --> 16:55.009
<i>but she was
just out of vodka. "</i>

16:55.114 --> 16:58.675
Let's go ahead and close the curtains, and
not accept any money while we're ahead.

16:58.784 --> 17:03.153
So, as you can see, any rumor of
a mole problem is completely untrue.

17:03.255 --> 17:07.714
<i>But, unfortunately, this was just as Tobias
appeared in his rented mole outfit.</i>

17:07.826 --> 17:10.521
- I'm a mole!
- Not the village!

17:10.628 --> 17:13.426
Families can come... Ow! Ow!

17:13.531 --> 17:17.866
<i>- I'm very particular about building codes.</i>
- The water tower.

17:17.970 --> 17:21.201
And this water tower
does not pass muster.

17:21.306 --> 17:22.864
- Lucille!
- Who can save our village?

17:22.974 --> 17:26.376
- Michael!
<i>- As it turned out, it was George Michael...</i>

17:26.478 --> 17:29.379
<i>who had finally gotten
his grandfather's jet pack to work.</i>

17:31.984 --> 17:36.045
Hard to breathe in this thing. It's
really hot. I'm sweating all over myself.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.623
I can't stop this thing!

17:38.724 --> 17:42.956
- You're blowing my audition!
<i>- I ache with embarrassment.</i>

17:44.763 --> 17:48.563
<i>The Japanese were never
to be heard from again.</i>

17:48.667 --> 17:51.158
Okay, what's going on here?

17:52.704 --> 17:55.229
Okay, that's no surprise.
George Michael?

17:55.340 --> 17:57.740
Dad, I-I'm sorry. I can't
fly it very well, all right?

17:57.843 --> 17:59.743
I think I would
rather have the Welch.

17:59.845 --> 18:03.679
I didn't buy you that. I bought you
the train set, which you guys just destroyed.

18:03.782 --> 18:06.012
Did you keep the receipt?

18:06.118 --> 18:10.054
<i>- What is that?</i>
- It's feedback. <i>Is someone else wired?</i>

18:10.155 --> 18:13.147
<i>Oh, that's me.</i>
My friend Frank wired me.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.783
- He wanted me to be a mole.
- Our cover's blown.

18:15.894 --> 18:19.421
Let's get out of here.

18:19.531 --> 18:21.692
Good-bye, Tobias.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.928
He wanted you to be a mole?

18:25.037 --> 18:27.335
Oh, my God. Tobias Fünke.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.773
You're Mr. F. Which means that man
was Rita's uncle. What have I done?

18:31.877 --> 18:34.778
- I have to get this suit back.
- They destroyed our town.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.781
- But they can't take away our memories.
- Oh! I've had...

18:37.883 --> 18:41.785
- the time of my life.
<i>- I think he's being sarcastic, Gob.</i>

18:41.887 --> 18:45.345
No, I'm not, Mother.
I mean lover.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.982
- I like making love to Mother.
- I mean lover!

18:48.093 --> 18:51.221
<i>- Oh, my God. Buster, is that you?</i>
- Yes.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.629
Gob, it's just I wanted
to spend some time with you.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.793
That's all. And you enjoyed it.
You can't deny that.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.895
<i>I guess you're right.</i>

19:01.006 --> 19:02.837
<i>Maybe we should spend
more time together.</i>

19:02.941 --> 19:06.707
- Oh, I'd really like that.
<i>- It's weird.</i>

19:06.812 --> 19:11.146
<i>It took some idiot parrot man with
a camera in his hat to bring us together.</i>

19:12.751 --> 19:15.652
<i>But even a pro
like Larry has a breaking point.</i>

19:17.854 --> 19:19.451
Rita.

19:19.558 --> 19:22.994
- What do you want? I have to pack.
- Pack? Where are you going?

19:23.095 --> 19:26.223
- Someone called the bobbies on us.
- No, no.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.993
- My uncle and I have to go back to big Britain.
- Oh, that was me, Rita.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.161
I am so, so sorry. I didn't
know what was going on.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.330
Why did your uncle
threaten me?

19:34.439 --> 19:36.066
He thought
you might be trouble.

19:36.175 --> 19:41.078
- That was actually very astute of him.
- Good-bye, Michael.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.946
You know, I really did fancy you.
I can't stay here now.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.678
- Marry me.
- What?

19:47.786 --> 19:49.777
Let me marry you.

19:49.888 --> 19:53.688
You can get a green card, you-you can stay
and we can just see if this works, you know?

19:53.792 --> 19:56.158
It sounds crazy, but this
will give us a chance...

19:56.261 --> 19:59.719
to get away from both of our families
and see if this works.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.562
Might be fun.

20:03.168 --> 20:07.195
- Really?
- Yes.

20:07.306 --> 20:10.275
Yes, yes, yes!

20:10.375 --> 20:14.334
But let's go right now, okay? Before my uncle
gets out of the shower for some more cigarettes.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.471
You take that,
I gotta leave a note.

20:23.722 --> 20:27.419
<i>But there was one piece of
intelligence that Michael didn't have.</i>

20:27.526 --> 20:31.895
- Interesting.
- Don't even think about it, Jay. She's an MRF.

20:31.997 --> 20:35.831
- MRF? What's that?
- Mentally retarded female.

20:35.934 --> 20:39.927
- That explains what she's doing with him.
- And the hats.

20:44.042 --> 20:47.341
Oh, my God!
She's gonna marry him.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.176
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

20:50.282 --> 20:56.016
<i>George Sr., disoriented in the walls,
almost makes contact with a new mole.</i>

20:59.424 --> 21:02.188
<i>Not that one. Wait for it.</i>

21:05.731 --> 21:08.529
<i>And Michael and Rita
start a new life together.</i>

21:08.634 --> 21:11.865
- What's that?
- A prize.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.734
A lovely, lovely prize.
