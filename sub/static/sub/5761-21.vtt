on <i>ghost whisperer.</i>

00:03.524 --> 00:04.958
how come you
can see me and they can't?

00:05.023 --> 00:06.457
that's a long story.

00:06.524 --> 00:07.791
there's
a better place for you.

00:12.624 --> 00:15.190
well, that means
there's someone else
out there...

00:15.257 --> 00:17.491
like me?
i know!

00:17.557 --> 00:18.824
it's the 5 signs.

00:18.891 --> 00:20.624
the dead dove
on the doorstep.
the bee.

00:20.691 --> 00:22.331
the writing
on jim's back.

00:23.006 --> 00:24.273
the dead will walk.

00:24.340 --> 00:26.707
and now, the forgotten
have returned.

00:26.772 --> 00:27.707
wait, so, all 5 of
those things have happened.

00:27.772 --> 00:28.973
not the writing
on your back.

00:29.039 --> 00:30.173
it was latin.

00:30.186 --> 00:31.752
it translates to,
"death of a loved one."

00:36.471 --> 00:37.520
what is this?

00:37.521 --> 00:39.087
what are you doing
with all these spirits?

00:39.154 --> 00:41.087
we're getting ready.
for what?

00:41.154 --> 00:42.154
for what's coming.

00:43.284 --> 00:45.839
he's been planning this
for quite some time.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.939
no, this is
bigger than just him.

01:52.605 --> 01:54.371
you shouldn't be here.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.007
why not?

02:08.443 --> 02:10.162
this is your fault.

02:16.999 --> 02:18.266
no.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.333

02:32.400 --> 02:34.133

02:34.199 --> 02:35.932
everybody's healthy
in grandview tonight.

02:37.050 --> 02:37.773
i got no work.

02:37.774 --> 02:40.173
i can't believe
i have a week of this.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.840
what time is it?

02:41.906 --> 02:44.073
4:10.

02:44.140 --> 02:45.673
delia!

02:45.740 --> 02:47.373

02:56.130 --> 02:57.063
hello?

02:57.410 --> 03:00.143
it's melinda,
i'm so sorry.

03:00.653 --> 03:02.234
what time is it?

03:02.235 --> 03:04.336
10 after 4:00.
i'm so sorry,

03:04.402 --> 03:07.302
i just--
i need to know
that you're ok.

03:07.369 --> 03:08.603
well, i'm not.

03:08.669 --> 03:09.636
you're not?

03:09.703 --> 03:11.402
no, i'm awake
at 10 after 4:00.

03:11.469 --> 03:12.869
why are you
doing this to me?

03:12.936 --> 03:14.202
ok, i'm--i'm sorry.

03:14.269 --> 03:15.302
go back to sleep.

03:15.369 --> 03:18.102
ok, wait,
are you ok?

03:18.169 --> 03:19.102
i'm fine.

03:19.169 --> 03:20.536
forget i called.

03:20.603 --> 03:21.536
all right,
good night,

03:21.603 --> 03:23.836
 good morning,
 good bye.

<font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@

04:27.080 --> 04:28.646
once again
you have proven to be
my best customer.

04:30.077 --> 04:32.821
this is a birthday gift
that ned will never expect.

04:32.822 --> 04:34.588
you know, do you think
he's going to get it?

04:34.655 --> 04:36.022
i mean,
will he know what it is?

04:36.089 --> 04:38.489
oh, yeah, this is
all making a comeback.

04:38.556 --> 04:39.688
because they discovered

04:39.755 --> 04:41.855
vinyl produces
a better sound than digital.

04:41.922 --> 04:44.355
can you believe that?
do they still make vinyl?

04:44.717 --> 04:47.851
well, you know,
it's hard to find,
but it's out there.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.970
besides, i still have
my whole collection
in a box somewhere.

04:49.971 --> 04:53.103
right, i bet ned
can't wait to listen
to tom jones and neil young.

04:54.196 --> 04:56.179
ok, so, we'll skip
my collection,

04:56.180 --> 04:58.746
but a lot of bands
are releasing on vinyl
these days.

04:58.853 --> 05:01.621
you know what?
i think it's great,
totally original.

05:01.686 --> 05:03.454
hey....

05:03.521 --> 05:05.254
did i dream
that phone call last night?

05:06.852 --> 05:08.200
yes, you did.

05:08.201 --> 05:10.032
oh, you are such a liar.

05:10.033 --> 05:11.867
what was that?
were you sleep-dialing?

05:11.933 --> 05:13.767
nothing, i just--

05:13.834 --> 05:14.940
i just had
a weird dream.

05:15.770 --> 05:18.004
about me?

05:18.071 --> 05:18.843
i don't remember

05:18.844 --> 05:19.978
what it was about.

05:20.044 --> 05:21.678
but don't worry, ok?

05:21.744 --> 05:23.178
now, when are you going
to give this to ned?

05:23.245 --> 05:26.011
oh, well, tim is
trying to find
some really cool records.

05:26.078 --> 05:27.511
before his birthday,
i hope.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.744
so, that's going well?

05:31.480 --> 05:34.176
yeah, i mean,
i don't know,

05:34.177 --> 05:36.166
it just kinda
feels comfortable.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.267
you know?

05:37.333 --> 05:38.434
even if we're
just sitting there,

05:38.500 --> 05:42.033
not even talking,
it just feels right.

05:42.632 --> 05:43.830
that's great.

05:43.831 --> 05:46.565
yeah, well, baby steps.

05:46.632 --> 05:48.565
hey, do you mind
if i hide this in the back?

05:48.632 --> 05:49.964
uh, if you can find
a place for it

05:50.031 --> 05:50.964
in the black hole
back there,

05:51.031 --> 05:51.964
be my guest.

05:52.190 --> 05:52.886
hey! you know what?

05:52.887 --> 05:54.187
i'm going to go
get some coffee,
do you want something?

05:54.253 --> 05:56.299
yeah, that'd be great.
surprise me.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.934
ok.

08:28.537 --> 08:31.157
who are you?

08:31.158 --> 08:33.126
they told me
you would know.

08:33.345 --> 08:34.779
who told you?

08:34.846 --> 08:36.813
they said you would help.

08:36.943 --> 08:39.543
i don't understand.

08:41.423 --> 08:42.822
mary o'connell.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.192
mary o'connell?

08:45.193 --> 08:45.929
that was the beginning.

08:45.930 --> 08:46.947
the beginning of what?

08:58.711 --> 09:01.245
you remember what happened,
don't you, lynn?

09:01.312 --> 09:03.078
don't you remember?

09:03.145 --> 09:05.511
that day, the accident?

09:18.845 --> 09:20.245
your dad
tells me you've been

09:20.944 --> 09:22.810
making these drawings
ever since.

09:24.377 --> 09:28.143
well, tell me, please,
why have you been
making these drawings?

09:28.210 --> 09:29.744
'cause i have to.

09:29.810 --> 09:33.011
but why do you have to?

09:33.076 --> 09:35.577
it's in my head,
isn't it?

09:35.644 --> 09:38.243
every day, i have to.

10:15.610 --> 10:16.810
same as it never was.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.176
hey, it's me,
i'm looking right at you.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.922
i forgot to ask
if you wanted anything
from java?

10:20.923 --> 10:22.740
uh, no, i'm good.
you go ahead.

10:23.487 --> 10:25.959
you know,
i think i'll wait.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.227
i want to try
and get a head start--

10:28.294 --> 10:30.094
whoa!

10:32.480 --> 10:33.713
i am so sorry.

10:33.780 --> 10:35.079
are you ok?

10:35.146 --> 10:36.761
i didn't even see you.

10:36.762 --> 10:37.995
no, it really was my fault,

10:38.062 --> 10:39.595
i wasn't even
paying attention.

10:39.662 --> 10:41.129
stay off cell phones.

10:41.196 --> 10:42.296
delia, are you all right?

10:42.362 --> 10:43.929
do you want to just
go sit for a minute?

10:43.995 --> 10:45.929
no, i'm ok, really,
please, i'm fine.

10:45.995 --> 10:50.296
it was a close call,
but that's it.

10:50.362 --> 10:52.296
hey, everything's fine.

10:52.362 --> 10:53.463
next show is 2 p.m.

10:53.529 --> 10:54.862
i'm going
to be here all week.

10:54.929 --> 10:58.129
it's fine, please,
i'm gonna just, um...

10:58.196 --> 10:59.529
i'm going to go
sit down in the shop.

11:21.191 --> 11:24.625
ok, i get it.
it's about water.

12:57.528 --> 12:59.960
all right, so this woman
died on a ferry 2 years ago,

13:00.027 --> 13:02.060
or maybe she didn't,
maybe she doesn't
know how she died,

13:02.127 --> 13:03.427
and you have to tell her,
i don't know.

13:03.494 --> 13:05.027
it sounds
simple to me, whatever.

13:05.094 --> 13:07.268
yeah, but what about
the visions
of impending death?

13:07.319 --> 13:08.919
you think they all
refer to delia?

13:09.109 --> 13:11.097
look, there were
5 signs this past year.

13:11.098 --> 13:12.898
the dead dove, the bee,
the dead will walk,

13:12.964 --> 13:14.432
 the return
 of the forgotten.

13:14.498 --> 13:16.532
the only thing
that hasn't happened
is death of a loved one.

13:16.597 --> 13:18.265
don't you think that
it--it could be related?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.465
how do i know? you're
the one that gets
all the neat visions.

13:20.532 --> 13:22.498
you drink the champagne,
i only get the hangover.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.098
sorry,
guess i caught you
at a bad time.

13:25.099 --> 13:26.666
oh, no, no, you caught me
at a great time.

13:27.889 --> 13:29.132
you seem to be packing.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.200
yes, i'm packing.

13:30.266 --> 13:32.233
i am going
on a sabbatical.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.834
i have
a fantastic opportunity

13:33.835 --> 13:35.801
to do research
in a peruvian jungle.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.582
just like that,
up and gone?

13:37.649 --> 13:38.683
just like that.

13:38.749 --> 13:39.576
nothing supernatural,
either.

13:39.577 --> 13:41.443
although, i should check
and see if jungle insects
have souls,

13:41.510 --> 13:43.710
i'd hate to be haunted
by an earth-bound cicada.

13:45.310 --> 13:48.977
you know we never really...

13:49.043 --> 13:52.911
we never got to talk about
everything that happened.

13:52.977 --> 13:57.043
talking's not always
the best thing.

13:57.110 --> 13:59.710
i'm in that odd place
where i may speak

13:59.777 --> 14:02.877
the unadulterated truth
about everything
i think and feel.

14:04.063 --> 14:04.818
can't have that.

14:04.819 --> 14:06.852
no, we can't have that.

14:08.086 --> 14:10.427
anyway, nope,
this is going to be great.

14:10.428 --> 14:13.527
really a--just a great time
for me to take a break.

14:13.594 --> 14:15.441
i mean you do this
10 times a week.

14:15.442 --> 14:17.426
you know,
you talk to ghosts,
argue with ghosts,

14:17.427 --> 14:18.908
 you get your heart
 broken by a ghost,

14:18.909 --> 14:21.176
but for us mere mortals,
come on.

14:21.646 --> 14:24.646
hey, hey, hey, come on.

14:24.713 --> 14:26.646
this is a good thing,
be happy for me.

14:26.713 --> 14:28.212
i'm going to be doing
what i do and loving it.

14:28.719 --> 14:30.176
i hope you'll
keep in touch.

14:30.177 --> 14:31.097
maybe, maybe not.

14:31.098 --> 14:34.202
maybe we'll just
be 2 ships passing
in the night.

14:34.203 --> 14:36.570
don't say ships.

14:42.068 --> 14:43.135
hey, good morning.

14:43.136 --> 14:44.136
oh, thank you!

14:45.469 --> 14:47.436
boy, do i need this.

14:47.437 --> 14:49.638
yeah, you don't look like
you got enough sleep.

14:49.704 --> 14:50.604
you look great, too.

14:51.384 --> 14:54.150
as do you, tired or not.

14:54.217 --> 14:55.678
nice backpedal.

14:55.679 --> 14:57.579
listen, i really have
to talk to you.

14:58.091 --> 14:59.224
ok.

14:59.297 --> 15:01.586

15:01.587 --> 15:03.054

15:03.393 --> 15:04.460
 <i>led zep 4.</i>

15:04.527 --> 15:06.427
mint condition,
still shrink-wrapped.

15:06.493 --> 15:08.193
those are great.

15:08.744 --> 15:09.944
where did you find these?

15:10.011 --> 15:11.844
i'd rather not say.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.677
in case i outlive
my usefulness, someday.

15:15.744 --> 15:16.811
that way you'll
always come back to me

15:16.877 --> 15:18.378
for the vinyl.

15:18.445 --> 15:19.677
this is fantastic.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.111
now all we need
is some today vinyl.

15:22.178 --> 15:23.710
you know, bands ned
has actually heard of.

15:23.777 --> 15:25.311
i'm all over it.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.246
hey, you said
you needed to talk
to me about something?

15:28.247 --> 15:29.880
oh, no, no,
never mind.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.474
come for lunch?

15:31.539 --> 15:33.173

15:38.173 --> 15:39.940

buh-bye.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.340

to have to wrap this up,

16:17.773 --> 16:19.506
i don't have
flood insurance.

16:20.584 --> 16:24.414
i know that you
died in a ferry accident
in england.

16:24.515 --> 16:26.715
do you remember
anything about it?

16:27.886 --> 16:31.387
the water
took my breath away.

16:33.053 --> 16:35.120
i was so scared.

16:35.186 --> 16:36.717
i'm alone now.

16:36.718 --> 16:37.818
is there
something you need?

16:37.885 --> 16:39.119
someone i can contact?

16:39.185 --> 16:40.219

16:43.796 --> 16:45.562
how can you help me?

16:45.629 --> 16:47.328

16:47.395 --> 16:49.899

something about my friend?

16:49.900 --> 16:51.733

16:54.112 --> 16:56.878
i have to go
to the other place.

16:59.490 --> 17:00.790
ok...

17:04.255 --> 17:08.021
next time, bring a mop.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.626
you say she's been
doing this for how long?

17:16.693 --> 17:18.160
since the accident.

17:18.227 --> 17:21.726
every day,
every single day.

17:43.561 --> 17:45.793
can you ask her
why she keeps making these?

18:01.516 --> 18:03.412
she says she has to.

18:03.413 --> 18:07.480
it is in her head,
and she has to get it out.

18:30.123 --> 18:31.257
it's too girly.

18:31.323 --> 18:31.913
shush.

18:31.914 --> 18:34.151
what do you want,
football helmets
on the curtains?

18:34.152 --> 18:35.654
i don't want
curtains at all.

18:35.655 --> 18:36.655
why do you want
to cover the windows?

18:36.971 --> 18:37.976
i don't want to cover them,

18:37.977 --> 18:39.089
 i want to enhance them.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.690
this house has had
enough enhancement.

18:40.757 --> 18:42.720
when do we say,
"finished"?

18:42.721 --> 18:44.622
ah, never.

18:44.689 --> 18:45.955
why do i have the feeling

18:46.021 --> 18:47.622
that the words "never"
and "home improvement"

18:47.689 --> 18:48.888
go hand-in-hand
together, forever?

18:48.955 --> 18:49.589
you know what?

18:49.590 --> 18:50.857
you are very impatient.

18:50.924 --> 18:53.124
ok, it takes a while
to make a house a home.

18:53.551 --> 18:55.142
it took a while to make
this house a house.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.133
aren't you late for work?

18:56.700 --> 18:57.933
fine.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.786
you know
what my theory is?

18:59.787 --> 19:01.821
that window treatments
destroy marriages?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.775
well, yeah, that's
one of my theories.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.708
but...

19:05.775 --> 19:07.142
you're nervous,

19:07.209 --> 19:08.775
and you're
distracted by something,

19:08.842 --> 19:12.076
and that's why
the house is getting
another makeover.

19:12.142 --> 19:15.409
hmm, i was hoping
to appear industrious.

19:15.476 --> 19:17.276
well, you hoped wrong.

19:18.006 --> 19:21.359
i just keep getting
these weird visions,

19:21.360 --> 19:22.793
and there's
this strange ghost.

19:22.859 --> 19:24.193
strange ghost, huh?

19:25.011 --> 19:27.894
she keeps
showing me things,
and i don't know why.

19:27.895 --> 19:29.528
it's like she's sad
and in mourning.

19:29.595 --> 19:32.387
well, you think she's
trying to warn you
about something?

19:32.387 --> 19:34.162
i don't usually get
stuff about the future.

19:35.655 --> 19:36.897
you did last year.

19:36.898 --> 19:38.564
that turned out
to be right.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.361
i just know that i'm
not going to rest easy

19:40.362 --> 19:41.496
until
i can figure this out.

19:41.562 --> 19:42.763
and i will.

19:42.829 --> 19:44.196
and until then,
we get curtains?

19:44.262 --> 19:45.262
exactly!

21:31.731 --> 21:33.364
what is this place?

21:33.430 --> 21:34.996
part of it.

21:35.063 --> 21:36.163
of what?

21:36.664 --> 21:38.158
of what you have to know.

21:38.159 --> 21:39.992
what i have to show you.

21:41.416 --> 21:42.583
who sent you to me?

21:42.649 --> 21:44.999
they won't let me
see my husband.

21:45.523 --> 21:47.957
not until
i show you everything.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.309
so what do you think?

22:03.310 --> 22:04.390
how many times
do i have to explain

22:04.391 --> 22:06.024
the meaning of the word
"sabbatical" to you?

22:06.091 --> 22:07.457
definition--
leave with pay

22:07.524 --> 22:08.657
for teacher or professor

22:08.724 --> 22:10.958
for extended period
of study or rest.

22:11.024 --> 22:12.291
alternate definition--

22:12.358 --> 22:15.124
 an excuse for a confused
 and troubled man

22:15.191 --> 22:16.824
who wants to forget
about his real life

22:16.891 --> 22:19.691
and go and study
cicadas instead.

22:19.757 --> 22:21.791
don't forget
the "with pay" part.

22:21.857 --> 22:22.791
you know,
have you ever thought about

22:22.857 --> 22:24.557
new curtains
for this room?

22:24.624 --> 22:26.824
i don't think i've thought
about curtains, period.

22:27.768 --> 22:28.907
there might be more
to these visions

22:28.908 --> 22:30.074
than just
a ferry accident.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.507
well, you know what?

22:31.574 --> 22:33.607
these visions might not
be about just some ghost.

22:33.674 --> 22:35.607
you might have
a prophet ghost.

22:35.674 --> 22:36.607
ooh, that's a new one.

22:36.674 --> 22:38.074
prophet ghosts
are very common

22:38.141 --> 22:39.275
in all mythologies.

22:39.341 --> 22:41.574
i mean, ulysses
consulted a prophet ghost

22:41.641 --> 22:42.741
for homer's <i>odyssey.</i>

22:42.807 --> 22:43.774
native american traditions

22:43.841 --> 22:45.074
are rich
with prophet ghosts.

22:45.141 --> 22:46.774
let's not forget about
that rockin' trio--

22:46.841 --> 22:49.644
the ghosts of christmas
past, present, and future.

22:49.645 --> 22:50.845
so dickens knew about
the prophet ghosts

22:50.912 --> 22:51.797
and i don't?

22:51.798 --> 22:53.620
well, he didn't know
much about curtains,

22:53.621 --> 22:54.721
so i guess
it all evens out.

22:54.788 --> 22:55.954
can i just say
that this sabbatical

22:56.021 --> 22:57.287
has not improved
your mood?

22:57.719 --> 22:59.520
here's another theory.
how about this?

22:59.586 --> 23:01.752
how about your dreams aren't
really about the accidents.

23:01.819 --> 23:03.919
they're about the symbolism
behind the accidents.

23:03.986 --> 23:04.472
such as?

23:04.473 --> 23:05.773
well, you have a ferry
and a water motif,

23:06.183 --> 23:07.949
which makes me think
 of the river styx.

23:08.016 --> 23:10.649
in greek mythology,
it's the river that separates
the living from the dead.

23:10.715 --> 23:13.882
souls are ferried
across the river
into the underworld.

23:13.949 --> 23:15.049
what about last night?

23:15.219 --> 23:16.152
it was like there was

23:16.219 --> 23:17.338
some kind of
mining accident.

23:17.339 --> 23:19.403
yeah, but you said
they were all wearing
suits and ties.

23:19.403 --> 23:20.455
 i would think that
 suits and ties in a mine

23:21.228 --> 23:22.927
would be sort of
a fashion don't.

23:23.233 --> 23:24.465
a tunnel collapse then?

23:24.466 --> 23:25.833
a tunnel.
now you're talking.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.532
that's the classic symbol
 for crossing over.

23:27.599 --> 23:29.093
there were souls
following the light.

23:29.094 --> 23:31.061
it seems like someone's
trying to get you

23:31.127 --> 23:32.595
to intercede in something.

23:33.060 --> 23:33.994
what?

23:34.481 --> 23:37.782
whatever's...coming.

23:45.357 --> 23:48.265
he died, my boy, for three minutes.

23:48.265 --> 23:49.383
then he came back.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.519
is this why you came to see him?

23:51.734 --> 23:54.684
you said he's been drawing something?

23:54.927 --> 23:55.668
everyday

23:55.844 --> 23:57.687
since the accident .
everywhere.

23:58.239 --> 24:00.928
school, the walls, 
even on pillowcases.

24:14.993 --> 24:16.700
nice work stefano.

24:17.548 --> 24:20.290
tell me why  you do this

24:20.920 --> 24:21.911
i do it for her

24:23.575 --> 24:24.504
who?

24:25.597 --> 24:26.659
for her

24:58.846 --> 25:00.180
it really does
sound better.

25:00.247 --> 25:01.213
how come?

25:01.280 --> 25:02.646
'cause
it's analog.

25:02.713 --> 25:05.347
means it records
continuously.

25:05.412 --> 25:06.646
digital
is cleaner,

25:07.061 --> 25:08.695
but that's
because it has
to break it up

25:08.794 --> 25:10.194
and reassemble it.

25:10.607 --> 25:13.473
wow! i'm going out
with an audiophile.
who knew?

25:13.540 --> 25:14.907
you're going out with a guy

25:14.974 --> 25:17.007
who knows how to look up
stuff fast on the internet.

25:17.073 --> 25:18.055
so this is
how you guys
listened to music

25:18.056 --> 25:19.022
back in
the old days?

25:19.089 --> 25:20.355
yeah. mm-hmm.

25:20.422 --> 25:21.989
when dinosaurs
roamed the earth.

25:22.056 --> 25:24.422
what are all those
crackles and pops?

25:24.489 --> 25:25.922
it's just somehow

25:25.989 --> 25:27.655
part of the whole
experience, you know?

25:27.722 --> 25:30.522
when i hear it,
i am instantly
a teenager again,

25:31.130 --> 25:32.563
lying on my bed,

25:32.630 --> 25:34.163
dreaming about
the future.

25:34.230 --> 25:36.697
hearing it makes me
feel like i have
a lot of pimples.

25:36.764 --> 25:38.535
ooh! spoken like
a true poet.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.369
oh, hey. party is over.
the boss is here.

25:40.436 --> 25:42.369
hey! the party
is just getting
started.

25:42.436 --> 25:43.569
ta-da!

25:43.636 --> 25:45.036
damn! i forgot
the matches.

25:45.102 --> 25:47.070
oh, and the candles.

25:47.135 --> 25:49.536
and the song that
i was gonna sing to you.

25:49.603 --> 25:50.970
i'm not very good
at birthdays.

25:51.036 --> 25:52.536
hey, i still know
my part of the song.

25:52.603 --> 25:54.836
i could sing it.
whoa! ha ha. that's ok.

25:54.903 --> 25:56.436
we have a bunch of stuff
in the back.

25:56.502 --> 25:57.536
here you go, bud.

25:58.536 --> 26:00.036
hey. is that dope 6?

26:00.102 --> 26:01.135
yeah!

26:01.202 --> 26:02.135
tight.
nice.

26:02.202 --> 26:03.869
yeah.
how did you know that?

26:03.936 --> 26:06.070
i like music.
so do i.

26:06.135 --> 26:07.070
yeah,
but i like music

26:07.135 --> 26:08.703
even after 1990.

26:08.769 --> 26:10.936
that hurt.
hmm.

26:12.369 --> 26:15.036
hey, do you mind
if i skip out early
this afternoon?

26:15.717 --> 26:17.184
sure. what's up?

26:17.251 --> 26:19.518
i think i found a tenant
at long last

26:19.585 --> 26:20.638
for the house
on colonial road.

26:20.639 --> 26:21.706
ha ha. you mean
the <i>mansion</i>

26:21.773 --> 26:23.006
on colonial road.

26:23.073 --> 26:24.873
it's big, it's furnished,
and it's a rental.

26:24.940 --> 26:26.173
 it sounds like
 what they need,

26:26.239 --> 26:28.207
so i'm just going
to go take some pictures

26:28.272 --> 26:29.473
and email them.

26:29.539 --> 26:30.473
sure you don't mind?

26:30.539 --> 26:31.606
are you kidding?

26:31.673 --> 26:32.606
how many times
have you covered for me?

26:32.673 --> 26:34.372
don't worry about it.

26:36.475 --> 26:37.842
are you ok?

26:37.907 --> 26:39.641
me? sure.

26:39.708 --> 26:40.997
the last couple of days

26:40.998 --> 26:42.598
you seemed
really distracted,

26:42.665 --> 26:43.965
like something was wrong.

26:44.438 --> 26:46.471
it's just stress.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.971
the kind that you would
rather not know about.

26:49.037 --> 26:50.837
hey, look, i don't--

26:53.894 --> 26:57.033
you know how i feel
about all of this
supernatural stuff,

26:57.034 --> 26:58.034
but i don't...

26:58.101 --> 26:59.934
want it to put a wedge
between us.

27:00.001 --> 27:02.300
i don't want to be
on the outside of
the rest of your life.

27:02.817 --> 27:04.651
delia, this is my life.

27:04.717 --> 27:05.951
ok? it's--
it's who i am.

27:06.017 --> 27:07.318
there's no part of me

27:07.384 --> 27:09.551
that's not
affected by it.

27:09.618 --> 27:10.618
it's kind of like...

27:10.685 --> 27:13.117
love me, love my ghosts.

27:24.734 --> 27:27.487
ned! please don't
turn me into a clich?

27:27.488 --> 27:28.421
just turn it down,

27:28.488 --> 27:29.524
or i'm going
to take it away.

27:32.498 --> 27:33.712
thank you.

27:41.496 --> 27:43.563
you're gonna lose her.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.496
you're gonna lose her.

28:04.297 --> 28:06.663
you're gonna lose her.

28:08.397 --> 28:10.863
you're gonna lose her.

28:17.097 --> 28:19.696
you're gonna lose her.

28:19.763 --> 28:21.297
you're gonna lose her.

28:21.364 --> 28:25.963
you're gonna lose her.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.364
you're gonna lose her.

28:28.430 --> 28:30.629
you're gonna lose her.

28:30.696 --> 28:32.097
you're gonna lose her.

28:32.163 --> 28:33.397
you're gonna lose her.
you're gonna--

28:34.629 --> 28:37.397
aah! aah! ahh!

28:37.728 --> 28:40.396
???

28:47.054 --> 28:47.931
ned...

28:48.719 --> 28:52.052
i am so sorry.
what happened?

28:52.118 --> 28:54.851
it was that turntable.

28:54.918 --> 28:58.851
it started saying
weird things.

28:58.918 --> 29:00.719
she tried
to turn it off, and...

29:00.786 --> 29:03.118
she just froze.

29:03.185 --> 29:05.786
i didn't even know
what was happening.

29:05.851 --> 29:07.252
it's all right.

29:07.319 --> 29:09.419
is she dead?

29:09.485 --> 29:10.786
shh.

29:10.851 --> 29:12.985
no, we don't talk
like that, all right?

29:15.118 --> 29:16.234
ok.

29:16.235 --> 29:17.569
she's gonna be
all right.

29:19.902 --> 29:21.702
she's got a burn
on her hand,

29:21.769 --> 29:23.769
she took a pretty
good jolt from
that turntable.

29:23.836 --> 29:25.669
it was a freak short
or something.

29:25.735 --> 29:27.435
yeah, maybe not so freaky.

29:27.502 --> 29:28.869
tell me
all this later.

29:28.936 --> 29:30.435
i've got to get back
out there.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.635
flaherty's gonna
come stay with ned
as soon as he can.

29:32.702 --> 29:33.836
ok.
all right.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.001
bye.

29:52.238 --> 29:53.153
???

29:53.590 --> 29:54.823
melinda,
you're looking well.

29:54.824 --> 29:55.991
what the hell
are you doing here?

29:56.057 --> 29:58.024
good question.
it seems i'm a little early.

29:58.091 --> 29:59.358
early for what?

30:00.312 --> 30:02.038
call me sentimental.

30:02.358 --> 30:04.228
i just can't seem
to get over grandview.

30:05.327 --> 30:06.245
???

30:17.154 --> 30:17.981
the guy's a freak.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.917
he plastered a whole room
with your photograph.

30:19.982 --> 30:21.383
he's stalking you.

30:21.450 --> 30:24.216
yeah, i know.
i was there.

30:24.719 --> 30:26.652
what was he doin'
at the hospital?

30:26.719 --> 30:27.484
i don't know
exactly,

30:27.485 --> 30:29.118
but he said he was
a little early.

30:30.027 --> 30:32.494
little early, for what?

30:32.561 --> 30:34.733
wait, you don't think
he was going to try
to grab delia's soul--

30:34.734 --> 30:36.833
don't even say it.

30:36.999 --> 30:39.100
you gotta think
gabriel had something
to do with this.

30:39.475 --> 30:41.275
i mean, is this about
death of a loved one?

30:41.880 --> 30:43.415
i don't know.

30:43.416 --> 30:46.050
but i'm...scared.

30:46.764 --> 30:49.831
i feel like
there's this game
being played,

30:49.898 --> 30:52.330
and i'm the only one
who doesn't know
what it is.

30:52.397 --> 30:54.625
you're not the only one.

30:54.626 --> 30:57.293
and you will never be
the only one.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.260
you're not alone.

32:04.535 --> 32:07.336
aah!

32:19.064 --> 32:20.131
aahh!

33:06.979 --> 33:09.878
why are you showing me
all of this?
what does it mean?

33:09.945 --> 33:12.179
so you can know
who to save.

33:12.245 --> 33:13.678
why can't you tell me?

33:13.745 --> 33:16.446
it's not for me
to know.

33:34.493 --> 33:35.593
it was raining cars

33:35.660 --> 33:37.564
and you didn't call me?
i did call you.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.916
yeah, after the fun,
as usual.

33:40.628 --> 33:42.787
all right, this is
what we have so far.

33:42.788 --> 33:43.649
we have a prophet ghost

33:43.750 --> 33:45.455
who's showing you
visions of
big disasters,

33:45.455 --> 33:47.888
and these disasters
are metaphorical
for death itself.

33:47.889 --> 33:49.755
you have a ferry,
you have a bridge
and a tunnel.

33:49.822 --> 33:51.589
these are all
mythological journeys
of the soul.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.097
and weird visions
of someone's death,
i think, delia's.

33:55.164 --> 33:56.997
well, that could
bring to mind

33:57.064 --> 33:58.897
the death of a loved one
warning that we had,

33:58.963 --> 34:00.663
and last night
she almost
got fried, right?

34:00.730 --> 34:03.230
uh, i would put it
a ???

34:03.297 --> 34:04.830
but, yes.
and gabriel was there,

34:04.897 --> 34:07.630
just hanging out
at the hospital
like a vulture.

34:07.696 --> 34:09.197
yeah, the self-proclaimed
collector of souls

34:09.264 --> 34:10.897
awaiting his spoils.

34:10.963 --> 34:12.730
you gotta admit,
i turn a good phrase
now and then.

34:12.797 --> 34:14.496
focus.
please stay focused.

34:14.563 --> 34:16.596
all right, all right,
look, this is what's happening.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.496
it's so secret
that in the past year,

34:18.563 --> 34:20.431
the way things
have been going,

34:20.496 --> 34:22.074
ghosts being able
to do things they never
could before,

34:22.076 --> 34:23.442
it doesn't take
a genius to see

34:23.509 --> 34:25.076
that the whole order
of things is being
shaken up,

34:25.143 --> 34:27.409
that the veil between
the living and the dead
is very weak.

34:27.475 --> 34:29.542
yeah, and all eyes
are on me, so what
do we do?

34:29.609 --> 34:30.809
we?
oh, come on!

34:30.876 --> 34:32.542
you can't tell me that
you're gonna leave now.

34:32.609 --> 34:34.909
i mean,
with the thin veil
and everything?

34:34.976 --> 34:36.475
oh, no, i should stay here
where cars fall from the sky

34:36.542 --> 34:38.442
and wives betray me
from beyond the grave.

34:38.509 --> 34:39.713
quitter.

34:39.714 --> 34:41.347
look, melinda...

34:41.701 --> 34:43.634
i'm gonna help you
do this.

34:43.701 --> 34:45.900
you're the bravest person
i've ever met in my life,

34:46.326 --> 34:48.493
and i won't quit on you.

34:49.386 --> 34:50.994
and?

34:50.995 --> 34:52.661
i'm waiting
for the joke.

34:54.529 --> 34:56.529
yeah, i can't think of one.

34:58.828 --> 35:01.362
the peruvian job
is gonna have to wait.

35:04.495 --> 35:06.928
heh heh, all right, hey,

35:06.995 --> 35:09.629
let's go tell delia
to watch her back.

35:12.395 --> 35:15.895
so what am i
supposed to do,
just run away?

35:15.961 --> 35:18.295
andrea was killed
last year, you know that.

35:18.362 --> 35:20.429
yeah, because
of a plane crash.

35:20.495 --> 35:24.029
because she knew what i knew,
and she acted on it.

35:24.030 --> 35:25.863
look, if i had
never told her
what i could do,

35:25.930 --> 35:27.963
then i wouldn't have had
to tell her about the signs
that i was getting,

35:28.030 --> 35:29.730
and she never would have
gotten in her car.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.229
so what are you saying?

35:31.296 --> 35:32.996
that there's gonna be
another plane crash?

35:33.063 --> 35:34.999
i don't know
what there's gonna be, ok?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.434
but i keep getting signs
and having dreams,

35:36.501 --> 35:37.934
and i think that they
involve you.

35:39.800 --> 35:42.867
i think that they're trying
to hurt me by hurting
the people that i love.

35:46.144 --> 35:46.878
you could be in danger.

35:46.879 --> 35:50.946
jim could be in danger,
and i think that's
what happened last night.

35:51.679 --> 35:54.876
last night was
an electrical problem
with an old turntable.

35:54.877 --> 35:57.077
yes, it scared
the hell out of me,
but there was no--

35:57.144 --> 36:00.710
ned told me about the voices
on the turntable.

36:00.777 --> 36:03.245
the record
was skipping, melinda.

36:03.245 --> 36:04.845
please.

36:04.912 --> 36:08.078
ahem. if i could
barge into
this conversation.

36:08.145 --> 36:10.837
um, i teach this type
of thing at the university,

36:10.838 --> 36:12.205
i made a lifetime
studying it,

36:12.272 --> 36:14.338
and i'm the world's
biggest skeptic.

36:14.404 --> 36:15.704
until i met melinda,

36:15.771 --> 36:18.138
i never believed in anything
i couldn't touch or see.

36:18.205 --> 36:20.005
see, i'm a man of science,
miss banks.

36:20.071 --> 36:23.171
although i've also
been taken for a man
of mystery,

36:23.238 --> 36:24.738
man of intrigue--

36:24.804 --> 36:27.671
is there a caboose
to this train
of thought, professor?

36:27.738 --> 36:29.704
yes, there is.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.471
you can fight it,
you can deny it,

36:31.537 --> 36:33.205
 you can turn
 a blind eye to it,

36:33.272 --> 36:34.905
but to quote
william shakespeare,

36:34.971 --> 36:37.638
"there is more in heaven
in earth, horatio,"

36:37.704 --> 36:41.604
or in this case, delia,
"that can be dreamt of
in your philosophy."

36:42.013 --> 36:43.606
point, please.

36:43.607 --> 36:45.207
the point...

36:46.185 --> 36:50.952
the point is
what do you lose
by believing?

36:56.952 --> 36:58.419
i think there is
something

36:58.486 --> 37:01.419
very special
about you,
melinda, i do.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.853
i believe
you feel things,

37:03.918 --> 37:07.219
maybe even see things
that we can't.

37:07.285 --> 37:09.281
are they ghosts,
can they hurt us,

37:09.282 --> 37:14.082
can they actually change
the course of our lives
from beyond the grave?

37:14.148 --> 37:16.849
i'm asking you
to believe that they are,

37:17.723 --> 37:19.822
and that they do.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.556
and i need you
to believe it,

37:21.623 --> 37:24.922
because i need you
to be safe.

37:30.022 --> 37:32.256
ok.

37:34.356 --> 37:36.089
i believe you.

37:42.740 --> 37:45.974
this is one of those
female bonding moments,
isn't it?

38:54.196 --> 38:56.463
you've got to see this.

38:56.494 --> 38:58.095
hey, uh, come on in.
don't be shy or anything.

38:58.487 --> 39:01.120
it's not like it's 12:30
in the morning.

39:01.186 --> 39:03.420
ok, this is about
the past and the future.

39:03.487 --> 39:04.786
that's a pretty
sweeping statement.

39:04.853 --> 39:05.886
you could be talking
about my credit
rating, or--

39:05.953 --> 39:07.786
ok, just listen.

39:07.853 --> 39:10.089
 we have been assuming
 that these visions

39:10.090 --> 39:13.689
have been some sort
of sign or warning
that something's to come.

39:17.290 --> 39:19.323
how's your italian?
 <i>bene.</i>

39:21.317 --> 39:21.984
well?

39:21.985 --> 39:23.987
no, that's it. <i>bene.</i>
that's the italian i know.

39:24.642 --> 39:25.975
i'm gonna kill him.

39:26.041 --> 39:27.941
all right,
look at the date.

39:28.008 --> 39:29.842
uh...

39:29.908 --> 39:31.135
may 11, 2003.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.637
ok, this bridge
collapsed 4 years ago,

39:32.704 --> 39:34.942
killing more than
111 people.

39:34.943 --> 39:36.976
then, a ferry
sinks off the coast
of england

39:37.043 --> 39:38.543
may 11, 2005.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.777
the tunnel vision?

39:39.844 --> 39:42.510
a subway collapse
in moscow

39:42.577 --> 39:44.243
on may 11, 2004.

39:44.310 --> 39:45.310
flash forward.

39:45.377 --> 39:46.810
plane crash
outside of grandview

39:46.876 --> 39:49.110
may 11, 2006.

39:49.176 --> 39:50.943
a terrible tragedy,
hundreds dead,

39:51.009 --> 39:54.043
same date, same time,
all within the last
4 years.

39:54.110 --> 39:56.744
this has been about stuff
that already happened.

39:57.614 --> 39:58.813
what are you doing?

39:58.880 --> 40:00.826
well, this might still
all be about the future.

40:00.827 --> 40:02.827
how? all the visions
are accounted for.

40:02.893 --> 40:04.760
yes, but there were
5 signs, melinda.

40:04.827 --> 40:07.227
the, uh, the tunnel.
how many killed?
32, right?

40:07.294 --> 40:09.893
3 plus 2 equals 5. next?

40:09.960 --> 40:12.493
the ferry sinking,
311 dead.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.927
3 plus one plus one, 5.

40:14.994 --> 40:16.693
and how about
the bridge?

40:16.760 --> 40:18.727
111 people,
2 on the ground.

40:18.793 --> 40:21.693
one plus one plus one
plus two, 5.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.526
ok, but wait.
the plane trash killed 238.

40:24.593 --> 40:25.860
no, it didn't,

40:25.927 --> 40:28.626
'cause the initial
reports were wrong.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.593
family members
reporting the missing
were so frantic,

40:30.660 --> 40:33.394
they reported them
missing 2, 3 times over.

40:33.461 --> 40:34.560
and some of the people
that were pronounced dead

40:34.626 --> 40:35.893
weren't even on the flight.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.927
the official number's now
228 passengers,

40:38.994 --> 40:41.660
and there were 2 victims
on the ground, that's 230.

40:41.727 --> 40:43.760
look at this.

40:43.827 --> 40:48.727
that's 230,
2 plus 3 equals 5.

40:48.793 --> 40:50.994
this is all about fives.

40:51.060 --> 40:53.394
5 signs, 4 accidents.

40:53.461 --> 40:54.893
now we've come
full circle,

40:54.960 --> 40:56.760
which means
something else
is going to happen

40:56.827 --> 40:58.827
at the same time,
same date.

40:58.893 --> 41:01.227
may 11, 2007.

41:04.127 --> 41:05.960
one week from tonight.

41:11.526 --> 41:14.427
hi, this is jim clancy.
leave me a message.

41:14.493 --> 41:15.927
jim, i have to talk
to you right now.

41:15.994 --> 41:17.294
i'm on my way
to the firehouse,

41:17.361 --> 41:18.994
but call me

41:21.493 --> 41:23.194

with payne, and--

41:23.260 --> 41:24.394

41:27.136 --> 41:29.570

in may the 11th?

41:29.637 --> 41:31.570
who is this?

41:31.637 --> 41:33.836
6700 colonial road,
right now.

41:34.245 --> 41:36.345
no, wait a minute,
who is this?

42:37.812 --> 42:39.412
