WEBVTT

02:26.188 --> 02:30.150
LIKE CRAZY

02:32.444 --> 02:34.947
PISTOIA, TUSCANY
MAY 2014

03:08.189 --> 03:11.859
Mauro, did you not see the ladies?
Shut off the tractor.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.737
The ladies are behind you
with the peat.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.114
- Put it on the cart.
- Thanks.

03:17.323 --> 03:20.075
Sure thing, a little kindness...

03:26.081 --> 03:29.752
Have some decency,
close your legs.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.392
Moira! I'll do it.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.269
In line, get in.

03:47.353 --> 03:50.773
No, Giovanna, sit up front
or you'll puke on us.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.735
- Right or left foot first?
- Right foot.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.029
- Sorry.
- No problem.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.661
- Where are you going?
- The cosmetics shop.

04:03.786 --> 04:06.538
- Beatrice, be a good girl.
- I need sunscreen...

04:06.664 --> 04:08.999
I'd go alone but I don't drive.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.878
Hands off!
This is no way to win me over...

04:13.045 --> 04:15.172
You're right, Beatrice,
I'm fond of you.

04:15.381 --> 04:16.923
Thanks.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.635
There you are, sweetie!

04:19.802 --> 04:22.805
Come here, my love!

04:23.013 --> 04:25.641
- What do you need today?
- Sunscreen.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.895
It breaks my heart
having to repeat this every time,

04:30.062 --> 04:32.564
but you know we can't let you out,

04:32.690 --> 04:34.942
you're under restraining orders

04:35.150 --> 04:37.069
and must respect
the therapeutic plan.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.780
I thought you were
smarter than this.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.574
You know I'm the victim
of legal actions

04:42.783 --> 04:47.329
taken by deadbeats interested
in getting their hands on my money.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.082
You have two definitive convictions.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.836
They won the case thanks
to the sectarian Commie judges.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.796
Everyone knows that!

04:56.046 --> 04:58.340
I can relate to
our poor Prime Minister.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.592
- Ex, luckily.
- They all betrayed him.

05:00.801 --> 05:05.180
Even the nuns say he's a pig
but he's an exquisite man.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.349
I went on his yacht in Sardinia

05:07.725 --> 05:09.810
with Pierluigi, as you know...

05:09.977 --> 05:12.104
He's a kind, generous man.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.232
And I won't be silenced,
he's a man who gives and gives.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.360
Listen, I'm fond of you.
Really fond of you.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.070
Really.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.989
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

05:22.114 --> 05:25.701
But you must learn to get along
with the other guests.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.620
- Meaning?
- Learn to be accepting of differences.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.247
Try at least.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.459
If you're referring to that nutcase
Moira you placed in my room,

05:33.709 --> 05:36.128
I beg to differ.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.381
You want me to help you
because you're not capable

05:39.506 --> 05:42.259
of handling her
obsessive-compulsive disorders.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.137
But I have other things to do,
I can't.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.515
Would you prefer Annapaola instead?

05:49.725 --> 05:54.521
But she's in regression...
Do I look like Mother Teresa?

05:54.730 --> 05:58.275
You would be placing
a huge burden upon me...

05:58.484 --> 06:02.154
How can I take care of Annapaola?

06:02.363 --> 06:04.656
I reviewed your drug therapy plan,

06:04.782 --> 06:06.867
you're mixing up your meds.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.411
I want to meet you halfway,
darling,

06:09.912 --> 06:12.664
but I cannot give you
your own room.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.417
I cannot allow that.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.939
- Who is it?
- A new girl.

06:49.952 --> 06:53.080
- Luca, how are you?
- Fine.

06:53.205 --> 06:56.417
Torrigiani from social services.
My colleague, Dr. Luca Moroni.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.961
- Here is her file.
- This is for me.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.671
Welcome.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.548
How are you?

07:02.714 --> 07:05.467
- She has a brace but can walk.
- Are you sure?

07:05.843 --> 07:07.719
Nice and slow.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.304
- Thanks, sorry.
- No worries.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.933
Isn't this a lovely place?
Like it?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.852
- Thanks.
- How was the ride?

07:14.977 --> 07:16.854
You'll be fine here.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.357
We had to sedate her.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.735
Luisanna, the head nurse.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.321
Morning, I'll go make up the bed.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.866
Suicide attempt in detention?

07:29.074 --> 07:31.118
Mind your fucking business.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.122
Such elegant reserve
on behalf of the staff.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.499
I'll hold this while you do the stairs.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.335
- Thanks.
- Need a hand?

08:19.124 --> 08:21.752
Bad girl,
you mustn't do things like this!

08:21.919 --> 08:25.297
You're all my guests,
my family donated this villa!

08:25.506 --> 08:27.925
- Yes, I know...
- Show some respect.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.178
You shouldn't look
at other patients' files!

08:31.303 --> 08:35.765
- This is my home, understand?
- Calm down.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.683
I'm too democratic...

08:37.893 --> 08:42.272
- Don't be mean, Beatrice!
- You ugly paupers...

08:55.827 --> 08:58.455
Excuse me, are you the doctor?

09:02.417 --> 09:06.463
- Yes.
- I was told to wait here for you.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.049
- Of course...
- Sorry.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.180
- Thanks.
- No need to get up.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.934
Donatella Morelli, correct?

09:23.564 --> 09:26.858
- What happened to your leg?
- I fell down the stairs.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.571
- Fell or threw yourself down?
- Fell.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.367
Drug use?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.869
Heroin, cocaine?

09:38.078 --> 09:42.249
Hash? MDM... that stuff
people use nowadays...

09:42.374 --> 09:45.627
- That makes you kiss everyone.
- Me? No.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.258
Very well, let's check
your blood pressure.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.595
- Blood pressure?
- Yes.

10:02.019 --> 10:05.147
I don't have
your drug therapy plan here

10:05.355 --> 10:09.776
but judging by your thinness,
you're not taking neuroleptics.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.529
Promazine, 30 mg.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.660
Anorectic depressogenic side effects.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.496
Any lithium?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.624
Citalopram, 40 mg.

10:23.790 --> 10:28.545
30-40 drops alternated with Promazine
depending on the doctor.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.798
What a disaster!

10:33.925 --> 10:36.803
All right, benzodiazepine... obviously.

10:37.054 --> 10:40.807
2 mg of Valium three times a day.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.935
30-40 drops of clorazepam
before bed.

10:44.144 --> 10:49.316
I love that stuff.
I take an antipsychotic, Haloperidol.

10:50.525 --> 10:54.154
It made me fat, gave me a real belly...

10:57.074 --> 10:59.826
I'm kidding,
just trying to break the ice!

11:02.663 --> 11:04.581
I fell for it, doc.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.294
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.799
I sent a request
to the tutelary judge.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.093
A written request...

11:16.843 --> 11:20.180
Over a year ago,
but I never got a reply.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.058
Do you think I should resubmit it?

11:23.225 --> 11:26.103
Well, depends on what your request was.

11:26.978 --> 11:30.607
Maybe I wrote it shoddily.
Will you help me?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.985
Certainly.
The nature of your request?

11:34.736 --> 11:36.571
I'd like a photo at least.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.617
A photo of...

11:42.452 --> 11:44.454
Of Elia!

11:44.579 --> 11:46.623
Of Elia?

11:50.502 --> 11:52.254
Your son?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.759
All right, ready.

11:59.261 --> 12:02.764
It's off...
they always turn everything off.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.351
Move around my things...
it's so bothersome.

12:06.518 --> 12:10.605
Beatrice, we agreed you'd go
socialize in the tea corner.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.983
- Go on.
- I'm socializing here.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.652
No, you're meddling.
Come on!

12:15.861 --> 12:19.030
Sorry I'm late,
I was looking at your file.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.991
I can still help you.

12:21.241 --> 12:26.163
Miss Morelli, good morning.
I'm Torrigiani, your social worker.

12:26.288 --> 12:29.040
- I'd take her off neuroleptics.
- Thanks.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.376
Don't flub things up.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.670
- Is this everything?
- My flashlight...

12:33.879 --> 12:38.550
It's here. Flashlight, cell phone,
headphones.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.388
Meal time!

12:44.181 --> 12:46.683
Grub's ready, girls,
to the dining hall.

12:48.310 --> 12:51.938
- Wonder what the chef made.
- Something yummy.

12:52.147 --> 12:55.275
You've been holed up in here
since you arrived...

12:55.817 --> 12:58.653
Come eat in the dining hall
with the others.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.698
- Need help?
- No, I can manage alone.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.328
You finally came,
after hiding out in your room.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.830
Thanks, sorry.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.466
Protein, you could use some.

13:19.716 --> 13:24.304
I'm grazing today, like a goat.
I've gone up a size.

13:26.431 --> 13:30.685
I bust the zipper on a Dior dress
that looked smashing on me.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.605
If you want you can try it on.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.566
I have a bunch of things
you could try,

13:36.733 --> 13:40.487
by my designer friend
who works in Milan and New York.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.448
Short dresses, lovely but short.

13:44.241 --> 13:48.620
I can still show my legs
but I'm nearing my twilight.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.624
But you're so young and pretty

13:53.458 --> 13:55.335
Maybe nobody's
told you that before.

13:56.127 --> 13:59.005
Pity you disfigured yourself
with these grotesque tattoos.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.968
What on earth were you thinking?
What a mess.

14:05.262 --> 14:09.349
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing, I like you.

14:09.391 --> 14:14.104
I don't like you.
Go sit somewhere else. Thanks.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.777
They should've turned
Villa Biondi into a luxury resort

14:20.902 --> 14:23.738
instead of donating it
for the public good.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.617
A fancy spa
with Ayurvedic massages,

14:27.784 --> 14:30.412
high-class guests, drinks at 7:00...

14:31.037 --> 14:32.914
Laugh away...

14:33.039 --> 14:36.793
The world's made up of people
who want to be sad, the majority,

14:37.002 --> 14:38.753
and have no desire to work,

14:38.920 --> 14:42.799
and those who want to be happy.
like me, I am happy.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.891
My husband
is attorney Pierluigi Aitiani,

14:51.057 --> 14:55.186
you might've heard of him on TV,
the PM was his client.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.274
- He's a genius.
- Who gives a shit about your husband.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.818
You're rude and foolish too.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.322
What you need is a good attorney.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.909
I understood it right away.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.049
- Not coming to mass?
- Who, me?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.967
It's a blast.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.595
There's a hot priest,
African but sexy. Come on.

15:29.095 --> 15:34.059
I'll lend you something,
I have the perfect miniskirt for you.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.567
Come take Communion.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.375
Don't we have to confess before?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.752
No need to confess.
Stand up straight.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.848
The Body of Christ.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.420
See how he looked at me?

16:43.545 --> 16:45.547
- Who?
- The priest.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.549
With all due modesty...

16:49.509 --> 16:53.179
I told Luisanna to put you in my room
so we can chat.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.017
Go on...

16:57.684 --> 17:00.645
Excuse me.

17:03.815 --> 17:07.277
Step in the center of every
second tile, avoid the cracks.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.946
Basola, with those big feet
you'll have to take off your shoes.

17:12.574 --> 17:16.327
- No, I explained the rules to you.
- Take off your shoes.

17:16.453 --> 17:19.539
You shouldn't indulge her,
you should set boundaries.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.960
There's a chapter about OCD
in the DSM-4.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.962
Beatrice, thanks so much.

17:26.963 --> 17:31.843
Shut up, she never stops talking,
not even in her sleep!

17:31.968 --> 17:34.804
- Honey, I'll make up the bed after.
- Thanks.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.974
I freed up some closet space for you.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.186
Wooden hangers
are for winter apparel,

17:41.227 --> 17:44.606
the others are for skirts and pants.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.984
Half of this space
is for your creams and perfumes.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.361
If you need a glass...

17:52.739 --> 17:54.449
Is that all?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.619
I realize you're depressed,

17:57.702 --> 18:01.623
but I hope you've brought
a nightgown at least?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.709
Otherwise it'll be problematic
having you here.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.753
This is all I have.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.259
Well good thing you have me...

18:13.384 --> 18:15.637
good thing you have me...

18:16.763 --> 18:18.640
Try this on.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.269
Stand up straight.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.986
- Good night.
- Good night.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.289
Everyone's asleep in here.

18:56.553 --> 19:00.181
- Good night, Beatrice.
- Thanks, close it please.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.451
"Judge Lo Monaco"

19:27.417 --> 19:29.335
<i>Ma'am, I was sleeping.</i>

19:29.460 --> 19:33.464
Sleeping? Too bad...
I can't even sleep a wink,

19:34.716 --> 19:38.303
because I'm still in custody
thanks to your incompetent verdict.

19:39.929 --> 19:43.057
Mitigated, my foot,
they won't even let me...

19:44.350 --> 19:46.352
go to the hairdresser's.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.730
Oh please, give me a break.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.483
Go review the article in question

19:52.567 --> 19:54.944
if you haven't ever done so.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.614
You illiterate brute!

19:58.990 --> 20:02.243
Report me? I'll report you.

20:02.327 --> 20:07.874
I'll drag you before
the board of Magistrates.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.377
I'll pay someone to kill you!

20:11.502 --> 20:13.129
Do you understand me?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.131
That's my phone!

20:15.256 --> 20:17.759
You called the judge again,
at 2:15 in the morning.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.596
He already pressed charges
for stalking.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.640
- I'm taking this.
- No.

20:23.765 --> 20:27.018
You'll regret this abuse of power!

20:27.143 --> 20:29.646
Now go beddy-bye.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.858
Nobody listens to my advice,
too bad for you all!

20:33.900 --> 20:36.152
Use mine.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.489
Not sure I have any minutes left,
I just use it for music.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.412
You don't make calls
or send messages?

20:48.873 --> 20:50.667
That's horrible.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.267
"To dad:
I don't feel well, can we talk?"

21:08.685 --> 21:11.521
"To dad: sorry to bother you,
can we talk?"

22:13.249 --> 22:15.585
She's rummaging through
Morelli's stuff!

22:16.753 --> 22:20.256
- Anything interesting?
- Ever heard of the word "privacy"?

22:25.386 --> 22:28.389
"Uzzano, Tuscany:
hundreds seek out clairvoyant"

22:29.849 --> 22:32.852
Linda, no,
you'll destroy the inflorescence!

22:33.019 --> 22:37.023
- I'm no good at anything.
- Quit being dramatic.

22:38.733 --> 22:43.654
So I'm at the Royal Palace for the G7
with Pierluigi and the PM,

22:43.780 --> 22:45.865
when suddenly Renato shows up,

22:46.032 --> 22:48.993
he and I had just spent
a steamy summer together...

22:49.160 --> 22:52.038
He shows up
in the lobby of the hotel...

22:52.246 --> 22:54.791
No, what are you doing?

22:54.916 --> 23:00.046
Put the lavender under the gazebo
where there's more shade.

23:00.254 --> 23:03.299
Giovanna, make sure
to add water to the substrate.

23:03.508 --> 23:07.678
- So it compacts.
- But then it'll weigh twice as much.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.306
Just make a few more trips.

23:10.515 --> 23:14.560
You could stand to lose some weight,
lazybones.

23:15.770 --> 23:20.691
So I was at dinner with them,
Bill Clinton was there too...

23:20.817 --> 23:22.819
He was very friendly...

23:22.944 --> 23:25.947
Hilary's a bitch, but he's a doll.

23:26.697 --> 23:30.701
But I couldn't wait to get out of there.
All I could think about was Renato.

23:31.035 --> 23:34.288
We used to make love
all over the place,

23:34.580 --> 23:37.083
in the car of course, at the movies...

23:38.584 --> 23:40.294
Once we even did it in church.

23:40.461 --> 23:44.090
There was intense Eros between us,
so mysterious.

23:44.298 --> 23:48.094
Renato is no intellectual
but he's an amazing lover,

23:48.344 --> 23:50.346
quite imaginative...

23:52.682 --> 23:54.475
Am I boring you?

23:54.684 --> 23:58.438
Darn, this broke off.
Shall I take it to the kitchen?

23:59.230 --> 24:02.108
Are you listening to music?

24:02.316 --> 24:05.361
If you're not interested in my stories,
just say so.

24:05.486 --> 24:09.574
- I was listening to you...
- I can't stand hypocrisy.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.577
- I am interested.
- No.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.872
- I was listening to you.
- What a horrible thing to do.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.499
What was his name? Luciano?

24:18.708 --> 24:22.086
No, Renato.
I've got nothing left to say.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.505
- Horrible!
- Sorry.

24:24.714 --> 24:28.134
- You really are an awful person.
- I'm sorry.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.346
I got confused.

24:32.513 --> 24:37.143
The city nursery is looking for
two more patients to work part-time.

24:37.393 --> 24:41.522
But they want someone
who has experience with herbs.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.984
How's the new girl hacking it,
that Morelli?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.527
Not bad.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.655
She and Beatrice together
make one good worker.

24:49.864 --> 24:52.283
Yeah, one works and the other talks...

24:52.408 --> 24:55.620
When it comes to plants
she knows what she's saying.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.664
A bit of a slacker
but knowledgeable.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.875
Do you think they're ready to go out?

25:01.042 --> 25:05.421
Beatrice's subjecting Donatella
to a sort of love bombing,

25:06.297 --> 25:08.674
she basically stormed her.

25:08.799 --> 25:13.054
It seems the relationship
is doing them both a lot of good.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.307
I'm in favor
of them going out together.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.185
You're being rather Pollyannaish,

25:19.393 --> 25:23.189
this is still Donatella Morelli
who committed a serious crime,

25:23.397 --> 25:25.441
and is a likely recidivist.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.318
This isn't jail.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.071
We aim to help people change.

25:30.279 --> 25:34.075
As Sister Pia says, we're sinners
but God treats us like children

25:34.200 --> 25:36.035
so we may become his children.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.329
So true!

25:38.538 --> 25:42.708
I'd take it slow, someone
with a record like Beatrice's...

25:43.709 --> 25:45.836
episodes of violence,

25:46.045 --> 25:49.966
she inflicted harm on a poor soul...
let's take it slow!

25:50.091 --> 25:54.595
The poor lady was distraught,
she'd argued with her Renato!

25:54.845 --> 25:59.475
"Her" Renato is
a notorious professional criminal.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.854
His relationship with
Beatrice Morandini was dangerous

26:03.980 --> 26:06.566
and led him to another serious charge.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.734
My vocation doesn't allow it,

26:08.859 --> 26:12.697
but you must've felt
the felt pangs of jealousy in life.

26:12.863 --> 26:15.241
This isn't a personal matter,
Sister Pia.

26:15.449 --> 26:20.955
Then we'll let Beatrice go out alone,
so we can get a break!

26:21.122 --> 26:24.875
Luisanna, that's not for you
or Sister Pia to decide.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.878
The judge will have the last word.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.757
Sir, are you ready to accept
full responsibility for this?

26:33.968 --> 26:37.013
Shall I call them? I'll call them.

26:48.899 --> 26:52.236
- Wait for us!
- Beatrice, get in.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.781
- I still don't agree.
- Why?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.742
Bye!

27:06.500 --> 27:08.919
- Put it inside.
- Now?

27:10.046 --> 27:12.632
- It's so fast!
- Leave some space.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.051
Fill two, leave one.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.700
You should see how he looks at me.
Watch.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.703
Watch...

27:43.454 --> 27:45.206
He didn't look at you.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.834
He's really infatuated,

27:48.959 --> 27:52.338
I brushed him off
so he doesn't get his hopes up.

27:52.546 --> 27:56.717
If you think about Madonna
and Demi Moore...

27:56.842 --> 27:58.594
- Beatrice, hello.
- Hi, Giancarlo.

27:58.803 --> 28:02.723
...with their younger boyfriends,
I find it pathetic.

28:03.099 --> 28:06.310
Shut off the camera.
I know someone's there.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.354
- What camera?
- Shut it off.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.731
- It's not a camera.
- Right there.

28:11.232 --> 28:13.734
- Stay away or I'll hurt myself!
- Basola!

28:15.486 --> 28:18.072
I'm not stupid, you know!

28:18.239 --> 28:20.991
Giovanna, put that knife down!

28:21.117 --> 28:22.868
Please, Giovanna.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.372
Behave!

28:26.622 --> 28:28.374
Turn the light on.

28:30.876 --> 28:34.338
Liliana mans the pump,
Daniela holds the jug as usual.

28:34.505 --> 28:38.259
- Let's get some Sangiovese!
- No, I want sweet wine!

28:38.718 --> 28:40.511
We'll celebrate mass!

28:40.636 --> 28:42.888
A special mass!

28:44.765 --> 28:46.851
Hurry up.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.019
To the infirmary, guys.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.981
I don't want to go to the infirmary!

28:52.231 --> 28:54.734
- Stay calm.
- I don't want to!

29:01.115 --> 29:02.032
Come on...

29:02.158 --> 29:04.160
- Calm down.
- No!

29:07.913 --> 29:10.624
Girls, go to bed
She's fine.

29:12.001 --> 29:15.921
I don't want to sleep.
You hate me... yes.

29:16.297 --> 29:18.174
Cristiana, your meds.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.926
- Yours too, Annapaola.
- Thanks.

29:21.051 --> 29:24.054
- Do you have water for your pills?
- Yes.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.268
Everyone hit the hay now.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.940
- 5 mg.
- Double spritz.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.320
- Smells divine.
- Must cost a fortune.

29:39.445 --> 29:44.200
It's not sold in Italy, but give me
your Seropram and you can have some.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.661
Now you can relax.

29:48.204 --> 29:51.540
Good girl, Giovanna, relax now.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.084
- The Body of Christ.
- Amen.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.670
- The Blood of Christ.
- Amen.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.350
- Serena Pagni.
- Sign here.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.354
Moira Michelotti with two Ts.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.565
- Your John Hancock.
- Thanks, good day.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.860
- Donatella Morelli...
- Sign.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.697
- That's 120 euros.
- Thank you.

30:24.198 --> 30:27.117
- Hello, Morandini Valdirana.
- Sign.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.872
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.250
Cigarette money.

30:34.375 --> 30:37.086
Beatrice, it's 120 euros!

30:41.090 --> 30:43.259
Where's the minibus?

30:43.509 --> 30:46.220
The minibus should've been here
14 minutes ago...

30:46.387 --> 30:48.764
- 30, 31
- Did they forget us?

30:50.391 --> 30:52.518
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

30:53.727 --> 30:56.146
I'm getting anxious,
what if they leave us here?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.774
Come back, it's dangerous!

30:58.983 --> 31:01.610
We'll hitch a ride.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.114
- All 10 of us?
- No, it's not scheduled.

31:05.281 --> 31:08.534
- I've never hitchhiked.
- I'm afraid of hitchhiking.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.160
There's a bus!

31:10.286 --> 31:14.748
We're gonna take just any bus?
What number is it?

31:14.874 --> 31:16.792
63, come on!

31:17.126 --> 31:19.920
No, not the 63!

31:20.296 --> 31:22.631
- Come on!
- No, don't!

31:22.923 --> 31:26.051
Six plus three is nine, we can't!

31:26.427 --> 31:29.305
- Donatella, come back!
- Thank you!

31:32.558 --> 31:34.184
Come with us!

31:35.519 --> 31:37.021
Come on!

31:37.313 --> 31:40.024
- How kind.
- I'm afraid!

31:40.274 --> 31:43.569
- Don't get on!
- Get back here!

31:46.572 --> 31:48.324
Thanks.
Why not come?

31:48.449 --> 31:50.409
Get back here!

31:52.328 --> 31:53.954
To Villa Biondi, please.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.831
Turn around,

31:56.040 --> 31:59.335
take a right at Ponzano,
you can't miss it, thanks.

31:59.585 --> 32:03.339
Lady, we're going
to the end of the line.

32:03.797 --> 32:06.050
And where is that?

32:06.550 --> 32:09.970
If it's the end of the line,
there'll be other buses.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.973
Tickets? Obviously not...

32:13.098 --> 32:16.477
Spontaneousness is
always imprisoned by regulations.

32:16.685 --> 32:19.939
We've got cash, we're not refugees
you know.

32:22.608 --> 32:25.319
- We should've bought tickets.
- Oh well...

32:25.486 --> 32:27.821
- We have money.
- Oh well...

32:41.126 --> 32:44.129
- Where are Donatella and Beatrice?
- On the 63!

32:44.254 --> 32:47.716
I told them to not do it
but they wouldn't listen.

32:49.593 --> 32:53.013
- Sweet Jesus.
- Get in and we'll go find them.

32:53.222 --> 32:57.893
Sweet Mother of Jesus...
and of those two!

33:01.855 --> 33:04.024
I don't see any buses, let's ask.

33:04.233 --> 33:08.278
Why don't we have a drink?
Some green tea or...

33:08.404 --> 33:10.155
- All right.
- Organic juice.

33:10.364 --> 33:13.283
I wouldn't mind a beer. Hold on...

33:25.421 --> 33:27.548
Look, there's Luisanna.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.188
Sorry.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.026
Let's go shopping, we have money.

33:47.568 --> 33:51.905
What lousy stores though,
Italy really is in decline.

33:52.031 --> 33:55.951
What are these jobless people
doing here?

33:56.076 --> 33:57.786
Sweetie!

33:58.328 --> 33:59.955
A lingerie store.

34:00.581 --> 34:04.209
Let's get dolled up
with new bras and panties.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.211
I'm going to buy some Valium!

34:06.420 --> 34:08.589
- Meet back here.
- Okay.

34:19.808 --> 34:23.728
Incredible, I found a marvelous
babydoll and panty set!

34:23.937 --> 34:27.440
- I got drops and pills!
- The drops are wonderful.

34:27.608 --> 34:31.360
Let's go to the make-up counter
for some lipstick.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.739
- There they are!
- Oh God!

34:34.947 --> 34:37.367
Get the hell over here!

34:39.119 --> 34:42.331
- What are we doing?
- We're having fun.

35:06.855 --> 35:10.400
- Me?
- Sorry, I thought you were American.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.987
Do you know where
we can find a taxi around here?

35:14.154 --> 35:15.864
- No.
- Thanks.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.659
Need a lift?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.744
Where to?

35:20.911 --> 35:24.873
Villa Biondi, know it?
Take the 24 to Ponzano.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.167
Then straight up the hill.

35:27.376 --> 35:31.171
Don't mess up
or we'll have to double back.

35:33.048 --> 35:37.302
Didn't you work at Seven Apples
in Marina di Pietrasanta?

35:37.427 --> 35:39.304
- Me?
- No, her.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.181
What's Seven Apples?

35:41.390 --> 35:44.685
I was a regular there
before I got married, cool music.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.688
It's been a while though.
Still work there?

35:47.896 --> 35:50.023
No, she doesn't work.

35:50.941 --> 35:56.071
When you got on your cube,
everyone stopped and stared.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.823
What cube?

35:58.031 --> 36:00.701
You were with Maurizio,
the owner?

36:01.285 --> 36:04.329
Maurizio! Lordy, what a horrific name.

36:04.913 --> 36:08.834
Maurizio rhymes with Tizio,
horrible

36:09.960 --> 36:13.338
Those were good times,
we had a blast back then.

36:13.589 --> 36:16.216
Then that story ended up
in all the papers.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.720
- What story?
- Did it really happen or not?

36:21.471 --> 36:25.309
Newspapers always print
a bunch of baloney...

36:29.229 --> 36:34.693
Why don't we all go get a drink?

36:34.860 --> 36:38.739
- Happy hour at your house?
- No, not my house.

36:38.864 --> 36:43.076
There's a clean hotel nearby,
my friend works there...

36:43.243 --> 36:44.870
Quit pinching me.

36:45.078 --> 36:49.333
So long as there's a nice bar
that makes good martinis, I'm in.

36:58.884 --> 37:02.721
Wait here,
I'll see if there's room for us.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.224
Stay put.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.645
That jerk thinks we're whores.

37:09.770 --> 37:12.522
- No, he's lovely.
- My foot. Look at these...

37:12.731 --> 37:15.525
"Anal Vision 3D".

37:15.734 --> 37:19.655
You shouldn't poke around
in people's things.

37:22.282 --> 37:24.743
What are you doing?

37:25.786 --> 37:28.413
Can you drive? What are you doing?

37:28.622 --> 37:31.375
Be quiet, you need to be quiet.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.002
Hey!

37:35.045 --> 37:36.630
My Car!

37:39.549 --> 37:40.926
Not my car!

37:43.387 --> 37:45.138
Not my car!

37:50.143 --> 37:53.939
- Watch out for the bike.
- We're crazy, aren't we?

37:54.147 --> 37:56.149
Technically, yes.

37:56.942 --> 38:01.530
Amazing, we have a car.
We'll have a crazy good time!

38:02.322 --> 38:05.033
Let's go to the beach,
to see Pierluigi!

38:05.200 --> 38:07.286
- Who?
- My husband.

38:07.452 --> 38:11.164
We'll go out on the sea,
he's got a 60-foot yacht.

38:11.290 --> 38:13.083
We'll breathe some sea air.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.545
- What day is today?
- Friday, pay day.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.048
What date, what month?
ls it already summer?

38:20.299 --> 38:23.218
Dunno, but I want to go here.

38:29.099 --> 38:32.102
- Wanda Ulivieri.
- Coming!

38:45.115 --> 38:47.868
Oh God, it's Villa Biondi.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.496
Now what?

38:51.621 --> 38:53.957
- Shut it off.
- <i>Hello?</i>

38:54.124 --> 38:57.085
- Donatella Morelli.
- Here!

38:57.252 --> 38:59.212
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

38:59.338 --> 39:00.380
<i>Hello?</i>

39:01.089 --> 39:03.133
Can I come watch?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.388
We have to call the police.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.266
Wait till tonight,
it's a harmless caper.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.394
If we call the police
they'll be in a lot more trouble.

39:14.603 --> 39:17.272
Shall we wait till
she kidnaps her son?

39:17.397 --> 39:19.733
What do you think, sir?

39:22.152 --> 39:23.987
Let's wait till tonight.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.907
But downplay it
with the other ladies,

39:27.032 --> 39:30.535
because they seem to be
a bit worked up.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.997
- Let's all run away!
- I don't want to run away.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.666
And where'll we go?

39:36.792 --> 39:40.629
Sit down for group therapy!
Listen up!

39:47.177 --> 39:49.304
Sit in a circle!

39:58.688 --> 40:00.816
Does he know I think about him?

40:01.316 --> 40:03.693
He dreams about you...

40:05.070 --> 40:07.072
and calls for you.

40:08.698 --> 40:10.033
Really?

40:12.452 --> 40:14.454
Does he love his other mom?

40:14.663 --> 40:17.916
Does he know
she's not his real mother?

40:20.710 --> 40:22.045
Really?

40:22.212 --> 40:25.924
Where does he live,
can you give me the address?

40:26.550 --> 40:29.052
Quiet, wait.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.971
I see it!

40:31.304 --> 40:34.307
He's crossing...

40:34.850 --> 40:38.228
a river on his bike.

40:39.604 --> 40:43.692
He's wearing a lovely red sweater.

40:43.859 --> 40:45.068
Red...

40:47.237 --> 40:52.993
Here, a swatch from
the Holy Seton's robe.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.247
Go, my dear, we'll pray for you.

40:58.999 --> 41:01.960
Excuse me, I have something to ask too.

41:02.127 --> 41:07.257
Quiet, he often thinks about you
but is still hurting.

41:09.509 --> 41:12.512
He? Renato?
You mean Renato Corsi?

41:12.721 --> 41:16.016
Quiet!
He wants to come to you but can't!

41:18.268 --> 41:20.103
Incredible!

41:20.270 --> 41:24.149
You're phenomenal,
in fact he's under house arrest.

41:24.357 --> 41:27.861
His violence has deep roots,

41:28.987 --> 41:33.533
a troubled childhood,
that's why he pushes you away.

41:33.742 --> 41:34.993
So true.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.872
The fact that I was rich and he's not
always upset him.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.750
But it's a deep bond.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.877
- I can feel it.
- Me too.

41:44.044 --> 41:46.546
Me too... sorry...

41:47.255 --> 41:50.175
- He no longer wants to see me...
- Quiet, I kknow.

41:51.259 --> 41:54.554
But he's not well, he misses you!

41:59.893 --> 42:02.145
Hello, Renato?

42:02.771 --> 42:04.814
From a friend's phone.

42:05.690 --> 42:09.319
I just wanted to say
that I miss you too.

42:10.070 --> 42:15.450
And I'm glad that
you're no longer angry with me.

42:16.576 --> 42:18.787
And... what?

42:21.790 --> 42:25.293
I don't understand
why you're treating me like this.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.088
Hello?

42:33.843 --> 42:36.096
Put it in third, then fourth,

42:36.221 --> 42:39.808
downshift before the curve
then accelerate again.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.727
It's automatic.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.712
And with this guy Maurizio,
the cube,

43:08.878 --> 43:11.756
newspapers, your son...
what happened?

43:11.881 --> 43:14.259
Why don't we go back?

43:14.384 --> 43:17.137
You should open up and talk.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.640
Where the hell are we going,
what are we looking for?

43:20.849 --> 43:24.978
- We're looking for some happiness.
- Where, stupid?

43:26.980 --> 43:29.524
In nice places with linen tablecloths

43:30.025 --> 43:32.777
and good wine in crystal glasses,

43:32.902 --> 43:35.030
and polite people.

43:35.238 --> 43:37.282
That's where.

43:37.407 --> 43:40.535
Pity we don't have a cent left.

43:42.912 --> 43:45.790
- Where are we?
- In Butthole Nowhere.

43:45.915 --> 43:49.294
- Where?
- Montecatini's that way.

43:49.502 --> 43:53.882
Montecatini is glorious,
we could go to the spas!

43:54.007 --> 43:56.051
I grew up there and won't go back.

43:56.259 --> 44:01.181
Let's find a bank, an ATM.
How do you put it into first gear?

44:01.306 --> 44:06.019
It's automatic, understand?
You're so thick!

44:12.025 --> 44:13.693
Good evening.

44:13.902 --> 44:15.320
We're closing.

44:15.528 --> 44:18.156
I need to see the manager,
it's urgent.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.449
You are...?

44:19.574 --> 44:24.454
Maria Beatrice Morandini Valdirana,
the Countess.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.457
The manager must know me,

44:27.666 --> 44:30.418
we're important account holders here.

44:30.585 --> 44:33.421
- I'm the manager.
- Good evening.

44:34.089 --> 44:37.175
My colleague and I,
she's just waiting outside,

44:37.342 --> 44:41.221
have run into a little problem
I'd like to explain.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.472
Go ahead.

44:42.681 --> 44:46.101
We're guests at a villa
not far from here,

44:46.309 --> 44:48.353
it's quite prestigious

44:48.478 --> 44:51.981
and once belonged to
Marchioness CÃ stora Biondi Valdirana,

44:52.107 --> 44:54.484
my great-aunt.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.239
Due to some red tape...

44:59.364 --> 45:02.867
they've retained our credit cards,
ATM cards, and such.

45:05.328 --> 45:07.622
And how can I help you?

45:07.997 --> 45:11.376
Could you advance us some cash,
2-3,000 euros,

45:11.501 --> 45:13.753
nothing substantial...

45:17.716 --> 45:21.261
I'm perfectly fine,
you're the ones who aren't well!

45:21.386 --> 45:24.764
You banks are good for nothing

45:25.223 --> 45:29.519
but gobbling up the money
Draghi and the ECB granted you!

45:41.489 --> 45:42.907
Let's go.

45:43.658 --> 45:46.035
- Where?
- To eat.

45:46.161 --> 45:48.413
All I had today was green tea.

45:48.788 --> 45:52.417
A quick sandwich and
back to Villa Biondi before dark.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.377
A sandwich?!

45:54.544 --> 45:57.046
Who ever found happiness
in a sandwich?

45:57.172 --> 45:58.673
It's yummy.

46:02.802 --> 46:05.680
- Will you be tasting the wine?
- Indeed.

46:10.435 --> 46:11.686
Corked!

46:12.145 --> 46:13.438
I'll bring another one.

46:15.815 --> 46:18.818
- Corked what?
- The wine tastes like cork.

46:20.195 --> 46:22.071
You hurt his feelings.

46:22.572 --> 46:25.325
Enough with this
social inferiority guilt trip.

46:25.533 --> 46:27.452
Servers are people who serve.

46:28.161 --> 46:31.456
If I'm not mistaken,
the specialty here is shellfish.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.793
Jermann's screw top wine?

46:34.959 --> 46:36.336
All right.

46:46.179 --> 46:47.931
Perfect!

46:53.812 --> 46:57.357
Gosh, thanks, I appreciate it.
Thank you.

47:00.109 --> 47:02.362
- To Tchaikovsky.
- Who?

47:02.695 --> 47:05.114
- Tchaikovsky!
- Rock on!

47:11.079 --> 47:14.082
...So do you have any siblings?

47:17.961 --> 47:23.091
Before the mental clinics and judicial
psych hospitals did you live alone?

47:24.092 --> 47:26.845
Sometimes alone,
sometimes with mom.

47:28.513 --> 47:31.099
Do you have a father? ls he alive?

47:34.519 --> 47:37.522
- Did they divorce?
- Ages ago.

47:37.647 --> 47:39.107
All the better.

47:41.484 --> 47:43.903
Mine are still together,
it's ridiculous

47:44.112 --> 47:46.781
considering my father's a nance.

47:47.407 --> 47:49.659
A what?

47:50.410 --> 47:52.537
A fag, a homo, a butt-fucker.

47:53.997 --> 47:56.374
Sorry, I didn't mean to bring it up.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.878
They prefer
to hate each other politely,

48:00.169 --> 48:03.172
it's the perfect
passive-aggressive dynamic,

48:03.298 --> 48:05.133
a textbook case.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.552
I see...

48:08.052 --> 48:11.931
Tell me, are you on amicable terms
with your mother?

48:12.181 --> 48:15.393
She works for a disabled General now.

48:15.935 --> 48:17.687
And your father?

48:19.689 --> 48:21.691
My dad is awesome.

48:21.816 --> 48:25.320
What does he do? Does he work?
Is he unemployed?

48:26.029 --> 48:27.780
Pianist.

48:28.781 --> 48:31.075
How marvelous!

48:31.326 --> 48:34.454
So he's a classical pianist
who gives concerts?

48:34.704 --> 48:39.792
- No, modern music in bars.
- Well that's marvelous too.

48:39.959 --> 48:43.838
He was Gino Paoli's pianist
before I was born.

48:43.963 --> 48:47.550
Now he has his own band
and he sings too.

48:51.179 --> 48:52.722
Call him, let's go see him.

48:52.931 --> 48:55.099
- I'll call him for you.
- No.

48:55.224 --> 48:56.851
Why not?

48:56.976 --> 49:01.105
I wouldn't want to embarrass him
or ruin his reputation.

49:02.065 --> 49:05.985
You're not a criminal,
you didn't try to kill anyone!

49:09.197 --> 49:11.741
What's the band called?
Are they famous?

49:13.076 --> 49:15.495
Damn right, I'll show you!

49:18.206 --> 49:19.999
"Hurricane Trio".

49:20.625 --> 49:23.127
You could've just bought a notebook

49:23.252 --> 49:25.213
instead of using your body.

49:25.380 --> 49:26.839
I like it!

49:27.006 --> 49:30.885
Try waxing now and again,
you've got armpit bushes!

49:31.010 --> 49:32.845
That's embarrassing.

49:39.102 --> 49:40.520
Excuse me.

49:43.898 --> 49:45.733
You asked to speak to me?

49:45.900 --> 49:48.403
Actually, to the hotel manager,

49:48.611 --> 49:53.116
a dear friend of mine
and my husband's, attorney Aitiani.

49:53.282 --> 49:55.785
That would be me.
Good evening, ma'am.

49:55.994 --> 49:58.788
- Have we had the pleasure of meeting?
- How odd...

49:58.997 --> 50:02.625
I recall a tall man
with a thin mustache,

50:02.792 --> 50:05.044
rather charming...

50:05.253 --> 50:09.298
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'd be glad to help anyway.

50:09.507 --> 50:12.677
- Was the dinner to your liking?
- It was yummy.

50:12.885 --> 50:15.263
We've had a minor setback though.

50:15.388 --> 50:20.685
Some ill-intentioned folks,
probably Romanians or Africans,

50:20.810 --> 50:24.063
have stolen our purses

50:24.272 --> 50:28.818
with all our money, ID,
and credit cards...

50:29.027 --> 50:30.445
Everything.

50:30.570 --> 50:34.282
So I was thinking what I could do

50:34.449 --> 50:39.287
is leave you our car registration here,

50:39.454 --> 50:43.082
and come back tomorrow
to settle everything.

50:43.833 --> 50:46.085
I'm not sure I understand.

50:46.294 --> 50:49.714
We're going to get it now
and will bring it back here,

50:49.839 --> 50:53.342
in the meantime,
give our compliments to the chef

50:53.468 --> 50:56.471
who never ceases to amaze,
it was wonderful!

50:56.679 --> 50:59.474
And the musician is great too.
Thanks.

51:09.317 --> 51:11.819
- Are you crazy?
- Go, go!

51:11.986 --> 51:13.738
This is fun!

51:14.614 --> 51:16.824
Hey, that car is mine!

51:16.991 --> 51:19.744
Where are you going with my car?

51:19.869 --> 51:22.330
Get out of my car, now!

51:22.580 --> 51:24.707
- Ouch!
- Ouch what?

51:24.874 --> 51:28.461
I won't call the cops because
you're losers and I'm a gentleman.

51:28.628 --> 51:33.132
You won't call them because
then your wife would throw you out...

51:34.383 --> 51:37.970
Get your stuff and get lost
before I smack you!

51:41.390 --> 51:43.518
Pure insanity!

51:47.647 --> 51:50.233
How much for a threesome:
me, you, your daughter?

51:50.399 --> 51:52.151
- Excuse me?
- A threesome!

51:52.360 --> 51:54.487
- Hello!
- Hi, gals.

51:54.654 --> 51:57.657
- Let's take the train.
- At this time of night?

51:57.865 --> 52:00.618
We'll sleep in the station
and take the first one out.

52:01.119 --> 52:03.162
Hey chicken head,

52:03.371 --> 52:08.501
know who are the nastiest,
most evil masters of the world?

52:08.668 --> 52:11.170
- Multinationals!
- She doesn't get it.

52:11.379 --> 52:14.799
- I don't understand you.
- Forget about it...

52:14.924 --> 52:19.679
Are you nuts? Trying to reason
with two crazy ladies.

52:22.431 --> 52:25.017
Will you settle down?

52:26.060 --> 52:28.437
Be quiet and settle down.

52:29.397 --> 52:33.276
- I can't hear you from here!
- Chill out, damn it.

52:35.528 --> 52:38.030
- I like to converse.
- Damn it!

52:38.197 --> 52:41.576
Shut that damn mouth of yours.

52:42.785 --> 52:44.412
Who is it?

52:45.705 --> 52:47.206
Mom?

52:47.415 --> 52:48.958
It's mom!

52:49.167 --> 52:50.918
Why are you answering?

52:51.085 --> 52:54.589
Yes, ma'am. I'm a friend of hers.

52:55.464 --> 52:58.467
- Where are you going?
- To get them.

52:58.593 --> 53:00.428
I don't trust Luciana.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.471
Take Francesco and Giada with you.

53:02.597 --> 53:06.601
I can handle it, keep an eye
on the other girls, they're shaken up.

53:08.728 --> 53:11.981
- What are you doing here?
- Let's go.

53:15.067 --> 53:17.862
- You're here for me now then.
- Now and then.

53:30.750 --> 53:32.501
Is that her?

53:39.008 --> 53:41.844
What on earth have you done?

53:42.261 --> 53:46.474
Villa Biondi's been calling me all day
looking for you.

53:46.641 --> 53:50.019
But they're nice, they said
you could stay with me tonight.

53:50.853 --> 53:53.481
Villa Biondi must be a great place.

53:54.232 --> 53:56.108
You work and they pay you...

53:56.776 --> 53:59.403
And how much do you earn, honey?

53:59.862 --> 54:02.782
I need some bridge work done,
it costs a fortune.

54:02.907 --> 54:05.785
Even though I slog away
for the General,

54:05.993 --> 54:09.121
I still come up short
at the end of the month...

54:12.541 --> 54:15.544
Don't wake the General
or he'll never go back to sleep.

54:15.795 --> 54:18.673
But I read the letter...

54:18.881 --> 54:21.050
- What letter?
- The will.

54:21.259 --> 54:24.679
He's leaving it all to me:
Luciana Brogi Morelli.

54:24.804 --> 54:27.932
No surprise since his kids
never even visit him!

54:28.057 --> 54:30.768
Who do you think
cleans his ass every day?

54:30.935 --> 54:35.314
Who puts up with his groping hands
when I spoon-feed him?

54:35.564 --> 54:40.403
But when I finally own this place
with all its heirlooms and medals,

54:40.569 --> 54:43.656
I'll be able to help you,
my little darling.

54:44.907 --> 54:47.827
She doesn't realize
how much I love her.

54:47.952 --> 54:52.832
A mother's love is all giving,
never expecting anything in return.

54:53.040 --> 54:57.044
- Do you get along with your mom?
- No, don't ask...

54:57.211 --> 55:00.715
I'll show you your room,
if it's okay with you.

55:00.923 --> 55:04.218
- Luciana!
- Sweet Jesus, he woke up.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.470
Coming!

55:06.595 --> 55:07.972
Sorry...

55:08.097 --> 55:10.224
- Come here, honey.
- No.

55:10.433 --> 55:12.685
He'll be happy to see you.

55:12.852 --> 55:15.229
- He wants to see you.
- I don't.

55:15.354 --> 55:17.106
He likes you.

55:17.231 --> 55:20.484
Can't blame him,
with those perky buns of yours...

55:20.609 --> 55:23.487
- What are you saying?
- Mine lost their tone...

55:23.612 --> 55:25.740
But I still look pretty good...

55:26.991 --> 55:28.993
General?

55:29.201 --> 55:32.872
Look who's here,
isn't this a lovely surprise?

55:41.005 --> 55:44.342
No kisses, how gross!

55:44.508 --> 55:47.386
- Hush, he'll hear you!
- Quit pinching me!

55:47.511 --> 55:50.097
What are you doing?!

55:50.598 --> 55:53.768
Darn hot flashes...
Know why she's so sore with me?

55:54.727 --> 55:58.606
I didn't assume parental authority of
the kid, like social services asked.

55:58.773 --> 56:01.650
I didn't know
they'd put him up for adoption!

56:01.859 --> 56:05.029
You didn't know? What on earth
are you blabbering about?

56:05.529 --> 56:10.159
Ms. Beatrice, you explain it to her,
I did it for the good of the boy.

56:10.284 --> 56:12.119
It was only right!

56:12.411 --> 56:14.413
I couldn't raise him,

56:14.622 --> 56:16.665
I worked all day, she was a mess.

56:16.874 --> 56:20.503
Depression is a brutal beast.
A real family's better.

56:20.669 --> 56:24.548
So you knew very well
that he'd be put up for adoption...

56:24.673 --> 56:27.385
And Maurizio as a father...

56:27.551 --> 56:31.055
he went and fooled around
though he was married with kids,

56:31.180 --> 56:34.308
and when this dummy got pregnant,
what did he do?

56:34.517 --> 56:38.396
- Fired her from Seven Apples.
- Enough mom, shut up!

56:38.562 --> 56:41.190
- Thanks, now get lost!
- You hurt me.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.818
Knock it off or I will hurt you!

56:43.943 --> 56:46.404
I'll have you institutionalized!

56:46.821 --> 56:48.406
Go away, mom!

56:49.073 --> 56:51.826
Ma'am, I'll go make up the beds.

56:52.410 --> 56:53.828
Bitch!

56:54.829 --> 56:59.458
- She makes me sick.
- Complicated dynamics.

57:11.595 --> 57:14.098
- Doctor?
- It's Fiamma?

57:14.473 --> 57:16.350
Yes, they're here.

57:16.851 --> 57:20.062
Yes, they're safe and sound...

57:20.980 --> 57:23.607
I'll send them off to bed now.

57:24.442 --> 57:27.236
You can come get them, no rush.

57:27.987 --> 57:29.447
Goodbye.

57:30.114 --> 57:34.326
Can we get out of here?
But quit pushing me, okay?

57:34.493 --> 57:36.620
- Hold on.
- What?

57:36.745 --> 57:39.999
Let's see
if we can dig up some change...

57:40.624 --> 57:42.376
She's coming.

57:43.752 --> 57:46.005
Your mom asks you for money

57:46.130 --> 57:50.468
but she has 985 euros
hidden in a tampon box in her bag!

57:50.968 --> 57:54.263
I wondered why a menopausal lady
had tampons...

57:54.597 --> 57:57.725
- She'll report us when she notices.
- No such thing.

57:57.892 --> 58:00.978
She will, I know her well.
That's nearly 1,000 euros,

58:01.145 --> 58:03.772
we can make it last for a few days.

58:03.898 --> 58:06.901
It's like being in Rio
for the carnival!

58:07.109 --> 58:10.029
Let's ask someone for a ride
and get a drink...

58:10.154 --> 58:12.156
Someone who?

58:12.364 --> 58:14.742
Oh God...
No, please.

58:16.243 --> 58:17.912
- Excuse me!
- Where are you going?

58:18.496 --> 58:21.916
Let's get a drink somewhere,
will you give us a lift?

58:22.917 --> 58:25.044
Sure, lady.

58:29.048 --> 58:31.008
- Thanks.
- Get in.

58:35.012 --> 58:38.057
- I can manage on my own.
- All right.

58:43.187 --> 58:46.315
- Where to?
- We're going to Seven Apples.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.652
That name rings a bell,
was someone talking about it?

58:49.944 --> 58:54.031
It's casino night, with a roulette
and croupier from Montecarlo.

58:55.658 --> 58:58.327
Donatella?

59:00.579 --> 59:02.081
Honey ...

59:03.332 --> 59:06.710
- Not coming?
- No, I'll smoke a cigarette.

59:07.586 --> 59:11.799
Here's some money to get in,
I'll be inside.

59:12.299 --> 59:13.467
Wait for me!

59:16.095 --> 59:18.681
I want to dance all night long.

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:10.149
Look at what pretty eyes she has!

01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:17.239
Did you have fun?

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:18.907
Hi, Maurizio.

01:00:20.993 --> 01:00:23.245
Don't recognize me?

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:31.003
Can I have a vodka tonic, please?

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.422
Vodka and tonic separately.

01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:44.808
Okay, but then get out of here.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:58.072
- Hands off!
- Get out or I'll call the cops.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.576
Hands off or I'll call the cops.
Let go of me!

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:26.475
- Can we get out of here?
- Hold on, wait.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:30.729
Can we go, please?

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:34.108
It's not fair, they're cheating.
They're swindlers.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:39.238
Do you have any money left?
I need to make one more bet.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:42.741
Do you have your 20 euros still?

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:46.328
You blew it all?

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:49.832
Give me the money I handed you before,

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:52.000
I'm the one who took it!

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:55.879
I'm generous and you're greedy!

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.340
Give it to me now!

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.634
Are you nuts?

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:04.346
If I'm nuts then what are you?

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.975
What are you? You're psychotic.

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:11.353
You need electroshock therapy!

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.901
Answer me, you ingrate!
After all I've done for you.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:21.405
What? You're an old loon
who talks bullshit!

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.658
Big-shot attorney husband,
aristocratic family, all bullshit!

01:02:24.867 --> 01:02:26.660
How dare you?

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:29.413
You uncouth, ignorant creature!

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:33.500
Worthless trash!
Why did I waste my time on you?

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:36.295
Be quiet, you're in withdrawal!

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:40.132
Why did I put up with you
and your insignificant life?

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:43.385
- Insignificant life!
- Calm down!

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:46.430
Are you crazy?!

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.391
I'll kill you!

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:54.438
You didn't even want to see him!

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:56.899
Grab her! She's dangerous!

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:59.568
- I'll kill myself.
- Stop!

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:08.076
I won't go back in there!

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.330
Move it.

01:03:12.039 --> 01:03:15.209
She attacked me, she's insane!

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.586
- You should institutionalize her!
- Calm down.

01:03:18.337 --> 01:03:20.589
You're a shit,

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:23.467
you didn't even want to see him!

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.469
A shit!

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:26.970
Get in!

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:33.560
A shitty life, a shitty life.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.562
- You're fine.
- There's blood.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:38.315
- Calm down.
- Take me to the ER.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.984
Right away, just calm down.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:42.861
Get her a chair!

01:03:43.946 --> 01:03:46.990
Untie me! Why've you tied me up!?

01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:50.202
I don't want to be tied up, no!

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.586
You're hurting me!

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:01.505
- It hurts!
- Calm down.

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:03.757
Why me?

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:08.846
I'll stay here, they're treating
the cut on her head.

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:13.642
She has to go to
the psych ward too? Hold on.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:19.231
- Where's that other lady?
- Who?

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:20.607
Excuse me.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.402
Fucking hell. Give me a second.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:27.781
I'm Fiamma Zappa.
Lorenzini, head of the clinic.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:30.909
Where is she?
We need to take her back.

01:04:31.118 --> 01:04:34.621
Not yet. Torrigiani,
the social worker, is on his way.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:38.417
- Torrigiani, why?
- He already called the judge.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:41.169
She's going to
a judicial psychiatric hospital.

01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:43.630
Damn it, Torrigiani's an asshole!

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.632
Why didn't he call me?

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:48.510
He convinced the judge
that Morelli's a danger.

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:52.389
- After the nursery school incident.
- He told you about it?

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:56.184
Actually, we know Morelli,
she's been institutionalized before.

01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:00.314
The head doctor agrees with Torrigiani.
Psych hospital unless...

01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:04.568
She's not dangerous!
She didn't try to approach the minor.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:06.695
Unless what?

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:09.448
Unless her father
takes wardship of her.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.284
- Whose father?
- Hers.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:14.411
Floriano Morelli?

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:17.789
But he abandoned her years ago.

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:19.958
- Let me see Donatella.
- Hold on.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:23.045
- She's with him now.
- Him who?

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:27.215
Her father, she called him
to ask him to take wardship of her.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.469
She called him?

01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:33.931
You know what your mother's like...

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.809
she's convinced
she'll inherit the General's estate.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:41.855
Apparently, that old loon
showed her some letter...

01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:47.611
She doesn't realize his kids
declared him mentally incompetent.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:50.948
I'm in even worse shape.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.575
I play in shitty bars,

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:57.204
and I'm drowning in debt at my age.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:02.084
They repossessed my car,
and I've lost a kidney.

01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:05.253
A kidney, daddy? I had no idea.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:11.009
You need to help yourself, my darling.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:17.015
If the doctors and judge want you
in a judicial psychiatric hospital,

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.768
then it's for your own good.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:23.522
Daddy, are you getting treatment?

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:29.611
Dialysis twice a week,
there's not much to treat.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.284
You were so important to me.

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.286
Important?

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:40.288
Yes.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.126
I always listen to the song
you wrote for me.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:47.796
Remember? You'd sing me to sleep.

01:07:02.811 --> 01:07:07.065
I don't recall tucking you in
or singing you to sleep.

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:13.405
And I wish I'd written that song!

01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:18.410
Yeah, I might've composed it...

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:21.914
but I gave it Gino.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:25.917
My problem is I'm too good.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.838
- Don't even think about it.
- It's not much.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:33.175
- No need, daddy.
- I'm ashamed of myself.

01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:36.970
It's all I have, 120.

01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:42.100
But it's right for you to know
how things really stand.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:50.817
Now I have to go,
I have a concert to finish.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:54.112
- I missed you.
- Good luck.

01:07:55.197 --> 01:07:57.741
Good luck, Donatella.

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:00.452
- Daddy.
- What?

01:08:01.495 --> 01:08:04.122
I'm really sorry for calling you.

01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:08.001
I'm sorry for always being a nuisance.

01:08:16.885 --> 01:08:18.970
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:23.767
- What a jacket.
- What a shithead.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:26.394
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:29.731
- Let's find her partner in crime.
- We need to talk.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.408
Thanks so much, really!

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.121
You were sweethearts, bye.

01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:54.756
Oh God, she's here.

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:58.426
- She's here.
- Who?

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.554
The lady!

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:03.890
Aloha!

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:06.685
No need to get up...
Pierluigi!

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.189
You replaced the couch
with those atrocious chairs?

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.524
What's that breezy bed?

01:09:13.692 --> 01:09:15.902
Looks like a two-bit hotel...

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.904
Beatrice! What have you done?
Villa Biondi called.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:22.075
I was going to go stay
with the Albertinis or...

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.702
Her drops!

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.787
Or with Ippolita,
or even the Malagos...

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:30.082
But why should I be someone's guest
when I have a house!

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.836
- Aren't you glad?
- Are you okay?

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:36.423
- You skipped your meds yesterday.
- I just have a little cut.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.051
I could use a nice hot bath
and a good sleep.

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:42.345
Here.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:44.471
A welcome drink!

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.850
- You just showed up suddenly...
- How wonderful.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:51.979
I'll stay in the annex,
so I'll get out of your hair.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.608
Maria Laura
put the children's things there.

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:58.862
Your jaw's so tense, what's wrong?
But you look good.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.822
Here's what we'll do...

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:04.618
rest up and then
I'll have you driven to the clinic.

01:10:04.743 --> 01:10:06.494
I'll take the blue room.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.997
Ines!

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:14.377
Take me to the blue room,
I had an exhausting night!

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:18.506
Move that butt of yours,
you've filled out...

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.717
You knew she'd come here?

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.094
Darling, I'm still her attorney.

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:26.640
- Will you explain what's going on?
- Nothing.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.767
I'll take her back to Villa Biondi.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:31.519
I must ensure she doesn't get
thrown in jail again.

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:34.522
So she'll stay here tonight?
With the children?

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:37.234
Darling, try to understand.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:43.156
Glad we didn't throw away
your things.

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:46.409
We had to hide it from her
or she'd be furious.

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:49.537
My wedding dress,
how exciting!

01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:52.040
Wonder if it still fits me.

01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:04.261
Finally!

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.807
A nice hot bath
and an ice-cold drink

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:11.935
always restore my faith in life.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.895
Stay seated.

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:17.816
I'd be delighted to eat with you
if there's anything left.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.527
By the way, what'll we do today?

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:24.781
The yacht is moored,
we could sail out to Giglio perhaps.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.951
Matteo, Amelia, let's go.
Come on, Rachele.

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:31.538
- Well we don't have to go to Giglio!
- Mom, what's bipolar mean?

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.665
Please stay calm.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:37.711
I'd even be content staring out
at this poetic view.

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:52.309
Good morning.

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:54.102
This way.

01:12:13.872 --> 01:12:15.373
Hi.

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:19.377
I just wanted to greet her.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.134
- I'll do it myself.
- All right.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.011
I can do it.

01:12:36.728 --> 01:12:40.231
I really hoped
I wouldn't see you here again.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:43.109
No stupid stunts this time.

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:44.527
How's your leg?

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.781
My leg is fine.

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.492
Let's see...

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:55.497
Get up, miss.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.251
I'd give her 30 more drops.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.551
Your antics made
everyone uncomfortable.

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:12.514
- I made everyone uncomfortable?
- Why are you taking the kids away?

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.766
I'll explain it to you later.

01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:17.060
- Bye, kids.
- Say bye to dad.

01:13:17.268 --> 01:13:19.270
See you soon.

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.905
Is it just the two of us?

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:32.283
Why did you let her leave?

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:35.829
She's sweet, she loves you,
she's good for you.

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:40.708
I realize she bores you
but I'm sure she has good points.

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:44.087
She doesn't bore me,
why do you think that?

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:47.340
Don't be so disparaging
of the poor thing.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:50.593
- I love her, you know.
- Of course.

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:53.096
She's not like you

01:13:53.304 --> 01:13:56.599
and that orangutan jailbird
you cheated on me with.

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:59.727
You even forced me to represent him.

01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:13.324
You're beautiful.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.995
I bought it in a cheap store
but it's rather cute.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:21.374
- Tell me, have you seen him again?
- Stop it.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:24.377
I was afraid
you ran away to go see him.

01:14:24.586 --> 01:14:27.630
You're so jealous!

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.135
Tomorrow I'll take you back
to the clinic

01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:34.721
and I'll have myself admitted too.

01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:38.516
Yes, in the special ward
for clingy types.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.978
Clingy.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.036
"Donatella Morelli - son"

01:15:01.289 --> 01:15:04.000
"Rescued while trying to kill herself
and 8-month-old son"

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:09.130
"She wanted to kill her son"

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:14.177
"The boy swallowed a lot of water
and couldn't breathe".

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.180
"Enraged crowd:
she wanted to kill her son"

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:19.891
"She has a past of drug use
and mental health issues"

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:23.394
"Attempted infanticide"

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:58.680
- Are you coming back?
- God no, this place is a drag.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:01.224
I'm sorry you're leaving.

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:03.476
Goodbye.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:10.441
No need... I'm a big girl now,
goodbye.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:14.195
- Where to?
- Away from here for now.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.574
"Was Donatella Morelli
institutionalized? Attorney Aitiani"

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:21.953
- Mind if I smoke?
- It's illegal.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.205
Thanks, so kind.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:28.084
How much would it cost
to go to Mantua?

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:31.754
At least 500 euros, ma'am.

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.631
Make it 1,000...

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.384
- Are you married?
- With all due respect, yes.

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:39.971
Let your wife know you're mine today.

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:45.476
- How long has she been here?
- Since this morning.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.772
Donatella...

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:52.650
Shall we get up?

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:55.612
Come on.

01:16:56.154 --> 01:16:57.655
Did she eat?

01:16:57.864 --> 01:17:00.742
Dunno, I can't spoon-feed them all!

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:03.661
- Did she take her meds?
- She's a greedy one...

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.498
She wants to up the doses,
says it's not enough.

01:17:11.169 --> 01:17:13.379
What would you like?

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.132
Electroshock...

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:18.676
please.

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:23.806
She did a few rounds in Pisa
3 years ago and felt better.

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:27.310
Why keep her here?
Let's send her back there.

01:17:27.685 --> 01:17:30.313
Go get me her chart.

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:38.821
Unlock her room for me.

01:17:42.784 --> 01:17:45.328
I'll help you.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.338
Thank you.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:17:59.967
You're welcome.

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.553
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.932
Come on, you can do it.

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:11.187
- Wait here.
- Okay.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:21.489
Good morning, I ljust need 5 minutes
to see a relative.

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:25.118
- Sorry, I can't allow that.
- I'll be quick, really.

01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:29.247
Check with the office,
I sent an email...

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.998
I can't allow that.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.750
Are you a broken record?

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:36.337
- I can't allow that, please leave.
- So rude!

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.758
I'd like to speak to
Donatella Morelli, please.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.388
Yes, she's a patient of yours.

01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:47.598
It's boiling.

01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:50.101
I'm a relative...

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:52.353
Yes.

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:56.357
Her mother, Lucia...

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:59.610
I mean Luciana,
Lucia's my nickname.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.487
Luciana Morelli.

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:03.865
"Juvenile court

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:11.122
It's not possible?
What if I call back later?

01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:14.417
Perfect, thanks. Goodbye.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.253
Excuse me,

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.548
I've changed my mind,
a cappuccino instead of tea.

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:23.676
- With lots of foam.
- Lots of foam.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.432
No, leave the cookies.

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:32.393
Hi, Snuggles.

01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:35.813
No, it's nothing.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.691
I only gave you 40 drops.

01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:40.943
You seemed stressed,

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:44.405
I thought you could use a good rest...

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:48.785
I'll bring it all back, I'm no thief!

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:09.430
This is for you.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.725
You didn't get it from me, understand?

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:16.312
Don't get me in trouble, hear me?

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.333
"I know everything.
You have to see your son!

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.878

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:49.637
"It's not your style
but it's worth 35,000 euros!

do it Italian-style. Hugs"

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.488
She's a nutcase.

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.157
She's a nutcase.

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:12.785
A real nutcase!

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:34.307
- <i>Who is it?</i>
- Renato, honey, can I come in?

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:39.896
Will you open up? It's important,
I have something for you.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:44.191
- Take this!
- But why!?

01:21:44.317 --> 01:21:47.653
Stop it!
Why are you doing this, honey?

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.574
Your faggy husband
swore he'd spoken to the judge

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:53.951
but I found out it wasn't true.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.830
How much longer do I have to stay
locked up in this shithole?

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:00.041
I have cash, for you!

01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:02.168
I know you need it...

01:22:02.335 --> 01:22:04.337
- Everything okay, ma'am?
- Yes...

01:22:04.462 --> 01:22:06.714
Don't worry, leave me alone.

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:09.592
Let me come up for a minute.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.678
Renato said to give it to me.

01:22:16.182 --> 01:22:18.225
Give it to her?

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:21.354
- Got a problem with that?
- No...

01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:25.066
Are you in a steady relationship?

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:27.109
- Is it serious?
- The money...

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.488
- Here's the money.
- Yes.

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:35.493
- I can give you these too...
- I can't allow this.

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:38.996
I know it's not my business,
but we should get out of here.

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:41.123
Who the fuck are you?!

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.834
You can't take advantage
of her like this.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:46.003
Geppetto, I'll find you!

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:50.007
- I was going to pay you anyway.
- That's not it, let's just go.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:53.094
You're a psychopath,
you ruined my life!

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.388
- Love...
- Love, my ass!

01:22:55.513 --> 01:22:58.975
Don't use vulgar gestures
like that with me.

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:05.106
Drag in everyone
who was here on duty last night!

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:07.400
And let me know.

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:09.527
Nothing.

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:24.291
Thanks.

01:23:35.136 --> 01:23:39.306
Excuse me, I'm looking for Beatrice.
Moreschini Valdirana...

01:23:39.557 --> 01:23:41.767
Dunno, go ask them.

01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:43.936
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:54.196
Are you looking for Beatrice?

01:23:54.405 --> 01:23:57.074
Yes, she and I are friends.

01:23:57.575 --> 01:24:00.286
- I'm her mom, come with me.
- How nice.

01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:04.040
That nutcase has parked herself
in the guesthouse

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.709
and we can't get her out.

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:10.963
They want to shoot in there,
the set designers need to prep it.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:14.341
No worries,
she and I will get out of your hair.

01:24:14.467 --> 01:24:16.927
Good, go very far away.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:20.056
Is this Beatrice's house?

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:23.559
In her dreams, this is my house!

01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:28.606
You can't imagine the havoc
she has wreaked in our lives.

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.941
She's an egoistic liar.

01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:35.112
She's been deceiving people
her whole life, starting with us

01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:39.116
until she came across
an even bigger cheat.

01:24:39.325 --> 01:24:43.746
That unspeakable creature,
Renato Corsi!

01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:47.333
A real imposter

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.336
who sold nonexistent property.

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:52.755
And what did that dummy do?

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:57.384
She lost her head for him,
and he brought us to our knees!

01:24:57.510 --> 01:25:02.473
She signed anything
that crook put under her nose.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.727
She got hit with two counts
of bankruptcy fraud

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.982
and the family patrimony was drained
from all the fines.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:17.404
We've been reduced to renting out
our home for Italian movies...

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.281
Can you imagine?

01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:24.537
And every time she comes back here,
repentant and dejected.

01:25:25.371 --> 01:25:28.916
But enough's enough,
I have no pity left for her.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:31.794
She should kill herself
and put an end to it.

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:36.298
Go in there...

01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:40.636
and tell her to get a move on.
Goodbye.

01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:00.030
I made it, I'm here!

01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:03.701
- It's you?
- Yes, it's me.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:07.037
I ran away, can you believe it?

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:09.206
Can you believe it?

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:13.043
- I'm happy you've come.
- I've missed you.

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:16.046
I have a fever, I'm all achy.

01:26:16.172 --> 01:26:18.591
Nonsense, sit up.

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:22.469
- My sciatica's acting up.
- You'll be fine.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:24.847
It happens every time I come here.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:30.477
- No, these are slippers...
- It's a zoo out there.

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:32.605
It's cool.

01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:39.069
They're such clods... they put
fake camellias on the rose bushes.

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:41.071
Where's the other shoe?

01:26:41.238 --> 01:26:44.450
But those vintage cars are lovely.

01:26:44.617 --> 01:26:46.744
Let's go see him.

01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:48.245
Who?

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.833
What do you mean? Him.
You said you'd take me to him!

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.836
You wrote it here,
don't you remember?

01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:57.963
Are you blind? Read it!

01:26:58.631 --> 01:26:59.965
Come on!

01:27:00.758 --> 01:27:04.136
Maraschini Mangiarana,
move it or I'll beat you senseless.

01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:06.263
Has anyone ever beat you senseless?

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:08.974
Well, I will if you don't move it.

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:12.394
Move it, ladies,
are you in scene 38?

01:27:12.603 --> 01:27:14.897
Go to wardrobe, asap!

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:17.900
Wardrobe is this way, come on!

01:27:18.484 --> 01:27:21.779
- Aren't you an extra?
- She's a cutie.

01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:24.615
Francesca wants to start
with the Lancia shot.

01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:26.784
- Got a license?
- Yes.

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:30.913
- We're actually leaving.
- We're in the Lancia Appia scene.

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:33.499
- Then go to wardrobe.
- We're together.

01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:35.751
Shut up, dummy.

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:39.755
I'm thrilled we'll be in a cabriolet,
I adore cabriolets!

01:27:41.548 --> 01:27:43.550
Are you in scene 38 too?

01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:47.638
When we say "action",
start the car and drive to the gate.

01:27:47.805 --> 01:27:50.266
<i>Put her wig on, please.</i>

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:53.269
When we say "cut",
back it up to here.

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:56.021
Quick, before we lose light.
Clapperboard!

01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:58.816
Easy on the gas,
this thing really flies.

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:01.944
Silence please. Ready?
Camera!

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:05.781
- Rolling!
- Scene 38 take one!

01:28:08.701 --> 01:28:11.829
- What's that idiot doing now?
- Making movies.

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:14.331
She's no good.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:15.582
Action!

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:18.836
You're a bunch of Fascists!

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:22.172
- Elsa, you chased them all away.
- I'll drive this time.

01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:26.552
- Cut!
- Sorry, my bad.

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.806
- Go!
- Stop!

01:28:32.725 --> 01:28:34.601
Stop!

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:11.764
What's going on?

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.892
What's going on?

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.728
Don't know, hold on...

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.855
Hold on!

01:29:20.022 --> 01:29:22.900
We're out of gas, it's no big deal.

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:24.902
Come along.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:28.864
- Down this street.
- Where?

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:30.616
You can't stop here.

01:29:30.783 --> 01:29:33.410
Be right back, we have something
important to do.

01:29:33.619 --> 01:29:35.037
Are you crazy?

01:29:35.162 --> 01:29:38.290
According to some evaluations, yes!

01:29:38.749 --> 01:29:40.167
Come on.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:51.512
I'll get it.

01:30:01.188 --> 01:30:03.565
- Mr. Bonanno?
- Yes.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.194
Hello, may I have a word?

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:12.908
Sorry for disturbing you,
but I believe the time has come

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:15.577
to face an important aspect
of Elia's life.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:20.207
- Our son? And who are you?
- I'll explain everything.

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:25.963
I feel Elia should meet his mother
and hear her side of the story.

01:30:26.422 --> 01:30:29.466
His mother is here, inside the house.

01:30:29.716 --> 01:30:33.095
- Is this about Donatella Morelli?
- Yes.

01:30:33.303 --> 01:30:38.350
Social services called this morning
to tell us she escaped.

01:30:39.226 --> 01:30:41.603
Escaped... that's a bit much.

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:45.983
Are you in contact with Ms. Morelli,
where is she?

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:48.610
I'm just trying to help out.

01:30:48.819 --> 01:30:52.114
You should listen to me
for the good of your son.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:55.617
I don't understand,
are you a psychologist?

01:30:55.826 --> 01:30:59.246
I'm much more than that. Never mind...

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:02.374
May I have a word with you as well?

01:31:09.882 --> 01:31:13.969
Do you realize
you may be committing a crime?

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:15.262
Aiding and abetting.

01:31:15.846 --> 01:31:17.764
Know where she is?

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:21.018
If so,
you should inform the authorities.

01:31:22.519 --> 01:31:25.522
You have the wrong idea about her.

01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:30.611
I realize she can come across
as someone who's shady,

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:33.614
crude, boorish, ignorant,

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:36.783
primitive, almost beast-like
at first glance...

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:38.785
But she's not.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:42.247
She's someone who is good,

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:45.167
humble, loyal, generous,

01:31:46.293 --> 01:31:48.629
very romantic.

01:31:48.795 --> 01:31:52.925
She is fragile because
her heart is literally broken.

01:31:53.175 --> 01:31:56.678
And since the accident,
her life has been agony.

01:31:56.887 --> 01:31:59.389
- Accident?
- If you can call it that...

01:31:59.556 --> 01:32:03.560
Let's be honest,
the law is on your side.

01:32:03.769 --> 01:32:05.646
And if you so decide,

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:09.149
you can impede Donatella
from seeing Elia until he turns 18.

01:32:09.316 --> 01:32:13.445
You might not know, but
these encounters did already occur,

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.948
for three years leading up
to the adoption.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.699
Yes, of course.

01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:20.661
In a municipal office,

01:32:20.827 --> 01:32:22.829
in a room with two chairs,

01:32:22.955 --> 01:32:26.041
under the scrutiny of psychologists
and social workers.

01:32:26.917 --> 01:32:29.670
We realize it wasn't
the best of environments...

01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:33.674
Yes, but Morelli violated the rules
every single time.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.842
Because she tried to give him a kiss,
to caress him...

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:38.470
After the adoption became official,
she caused a fiasco.

01:32:38.679 --> 01:32:42.224
Fiasco? She just went into his class
to get a look at him,

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:44.309
she hadn't seen him in <i>2</i> years.

01:32:44.476 --> 01:32:47.229
They assumed she wanted to kidnap him.

01:32:47.479 --> 01:32:50.482
But this upsets Elia too much.

01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:53.235
You know, when we got him

01:32:53.443 --> 01:32:56.363
he couldn't stand up, couldn't sit still...

01:33:18.885 --> 01:33:22.639
Elia, Giada, come eat,
I made fritters.

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.892
Then off to bed,
we're going to the beach early.

01:33:33.984 --> 01:33:35.402
What did they say?

01:33:35.611 --> 01:33:39.031
We spoke for 30 minutes,
they seem like reasonable folks.

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:40.532
Can I see him?

01:33:40.657 --> 01:33:43.243
The wife has a different
Tuscan accent though,

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:46.872
perhaps from Grosseto or Maremma.

01:33:47.039 --> 01:33:49.166
Can I see him or not?

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:50.792
No.

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:54.671
- What did you say for 30 minutes?!
- Calm down.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:59.301
There's a chance that
they'll think it over and contact me.

01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:03.013
Contacts are important in life.

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:07.684
Now let's find some gas
and go back to the car.

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:13.774
On second thought, I'll call Pierluigi.

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.443
I'll have him come get us.

01:34:16.568 --> 01:34:19.196
So you can finally meet him!

01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:21.323
How does this work?

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:23.700
You can ask for legal advice...

01:34:23.909 --> 01:34:26.662
he is a real legal eagle.

01:34:29.456 --> 01:34:32.834
Hello, Snuggles? Honey, it's me.

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:36.088
I'm here with Donatella, my friend.

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:39.716
We're on the boardwalk in Viareggio.

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:45.681
If she appeals the sentence
will she be able...

01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:48.809
Of course.

01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:52.479
He's sending a driver!
We just have to wait!

01:34:54.981 --> 01:34:57.484
What did you do?

01:34:57.984 --> 01:35:01.238
What did you do?

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.741
I'm fine.

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:07.369
It's okay.

01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:10.247
Let's go sit down...

01:35:10.455 --> 01:35:12.874
get some ice in a cafe...

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:14.626
You okay?

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:18.630
We are, but you're clearly not
with those outfits!

01:35:18.839 --> 01:35:20.507
A cafe...

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:26.513
Cold beers.

01:35:27.848 --> 01:35:31.643
Naturally, I have some Valium
I stole from my mom.

01:35:31.852 --> 01:35:33.854
2 or 5 mg?

01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:36.398
5 mg!

01:35:38.024 --> 01:35:40.026
A cigarette.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:53.915
- Why did I do it?
- You sure are a dummy.

01:35:54.124 --> 01:35:56.293
Luckily, you have a hard head.

01:35:56.501 --> 01:36:00.172
They say I'm too unstable
and they must take my son away.

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.174
They, who?

01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:05.927
Social services declare
"parental unsuitability".

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:11.558
Eight of them come to get him,
with police in tow.

01:36:11.683 --> 01:36:13.435
Poor baby's sleeping.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.812
They don't even let me change him.

01:36:16.021 --> 01:36:19.024
They put him in an institution,
all by himself.

01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:20.901
For a little while.

01:36:21.067 --> 01:36:23.695
They say:
"Just wait, we have to decide."

01:36:24.404 --> 01:36:27.157
- Who?
- Them.

01:36:27.324 --> 01:36:30.702
So I wait. I cry every clay but I wait.

01:36:30.827 --> 01:36:34.581
They say I cry too much,
and have major depression...

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.335
"If you give him to me
I'll stop crying."

01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:41.171
"No, you have always cried.

01:36:41.338 --> 01:36:43.465
- You cried at school..."
- Me too.

01:36:43.673 --> 01:36:47.719
They know it all: I cried
over homework, over my dad...

01:36:47.844 --> 01:36:49.596
- In the elevator...
- Me too.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.973
I cried when mom yelled at me
for crying.

01:36:52.182 --> 01:36:53.433
Me too.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.979
"All right, I have major depression,
so cure me.

01:36:58.188 --> 01:37:01.566
- I was born sad, cure me."
- I was born sad too.

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:05.445
"Give me Elia. You won't
cure me by taking him away!"

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:08.740
In fact, kids instill a sense of joy.

01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:12.619
So they say I can go visit him
in the institution.

01:37:13.829 --> 01:37:17.499
And I go there every day, all day.

01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:22.003
I feed him baby food, not meat though,
he only likes apples.

01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:24.756
Elia and I laugh, you know.

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:27.509
But when I leave, he cries.

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.719
He cries like crazy.

01:37:29.886 --> 01:37:34.349
He grips on to me, they have to
pull him off finger by finger.

01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:38.478
I have to leave him there,
make him think that I want to leave.

01:37:38.979 --> 01:37:41.022
They say I'm not getting better.

01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:45.151
- I want to get better, I do.
- I want to get better too.

01:37:46.987 --> 01:37:49.030
One day they leave us on our own.

01:37:49.239 --> 01:37:53.410
So I take him out in the stroller
to see the Mardi Gras floats.

01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:07.007
What a sight, everyone looks at us,
everyone's smiling.

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:09.426
"Isn't he cute?
His name is Elia.

01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:11.928
He's my son, I made him!"

01:38:19.686 --> 01:38:23.565
All of a sudden I see him...
I see him there.

01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:25.692
Him, who?

01:38:26.318 --> 01:38:27.569
Hi!

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:30.196
He's there with his real kids.

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:33.950
- What?
- Want to see him?

01:38:34.451 --> 01:38:36.077
- Look at him.
- Get lost.

01:38:36.202 --> 01:38:39.205
- Look how cute he is.
- Quit trying to ruin my life.

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:42.208
- Just look at him.
- Quit trying to ruin my life!

01:38:42.334 --> 01:38:45.086
He says "slut", and other ugly words.

01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:47.172
"You fucked everyone.

01:38:47.339 --> 01:38:49.674
He's not my son,
he's Seven Apples' son."

01:38:49.841 --> 01:38:53.595
What do you want, money?
Here take this, and this.

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:56.848
Now get lost
or I'll press charges, okay?

01:38:57.057 --> 01:38:59.684
- I'll press charges.
- You didn't even look at him!

01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:03.063
I didn't want anything,
I didn't ask him for anything,

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:06.191
I just wanted to show him
how beautiful Elia was.

01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:07.984
Fuck you!

01:39:10.445 --> 01:39:13.448
I feel like crying but feel ashamed.

01:39:13.615 --> 01:39:16.952
God, I feel so ashamed,
I feel like a fool.

01:39:21.081 --> 01:39:24.876
I can't remember
how to get back to the institution.

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:27.337
I hop on a random bus.

01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:34.719
Then I get off and walk and walk...

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.722
Fuck you!

01:39:43.895 --> 01:39:46.773
In the meantime, Elia falls asleep.

01:39:47.524 --> 01:39:51.653
I think "God, now they're going
to take him away forever."

01:40:08.128 --> 01:40:12.549
I think about how much he'll cry,
how much I'll cry,

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:15.802
I think about how cruel people can be.

01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:33.528
No more feeling bad all the time,

01:40:33.695 --> 01:40:35.697
no more feeling bad.

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:39.659
I want to feel good,
we want to feel good.

01:40:41.953 --> 01:40:45.707
We don't want to die,
we want to be together...

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:47.584
forever.

01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:32.003
Later they call it attempted murder,
attempted suicide.

01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:35.715
Words like that,
what ridiculous words.

01:41:35.882 --> 01:41:38.259
But they don't understand a thing.

01:41:40.637 --> 01:41:43.973
While we sink down, we are happy.

01:41:45.767 --> 01:41:48.478
Luckily they rescued you.

01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:56.778
We're so tired, the two of us.

01:42:00.532 --> 01:42:03.284
We should get some rest.

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:07.122
I'd like to sleep for a month.

01:42:07.288 --> 01:42:09.541
I'd say a year.

01:42:12.168 --> 01:42:14.254
Or even die...

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:22.011
So my mom would finally be happy,
everybody would be.

01:42:22.637 --> 01:42:24.430
Are you crazy?

01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:29.060
And what would I do?

01:42:31.896 --> 01:42:34.816
- You?
- Good thing I have you.

01:42:35.567 --> 01:42:37.694
- Me?
- You!

01:42:37.819 --> 01:42:39.904
- You!
- Good thing you have me.

01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:41.072
You!

01:42:57.839 --> 01:43:00.675
Jesus, Beatrice, move it!

01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:09.976
God, there they are!

01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:13.313
Beatrice?

01:43:14.063 --> 01:43:16.816
Where's Donatella?
Search the area.

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:26.826
You can both come back to Villa Biondi
with a new therapeutic plan.

01:43:26.951 --> 01:43:29.579
I spoke to the judge,

01:43:29.746 --> 01:43:32.624
no judicial psych hospital, no jail,
but no more mischief!

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.503
Listen to me, where is Donatella?

01:44:06.616 --> 01:44:07.992
Sorry.

01:44:13.414 --> 01:44:16.292
Don't move her,
she banged her head!

01:44:16.542 --> 01:44:18.670
- Call an ambulance.
- Hold on.

01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:22.298
- How are you?
- No ambulance.

01:44:22.507 --> 01:44:25.051
You don't look before crossing?!

01:44:27.053 --> 01:44:30.431
- Don't move.
- Take it easy.

01:44:31.057 --> 01:44:34.060
- Don't move.
- No ambulance.

01:44:37.814 --> 01:44:39.774
- Any news?
- An accident.

01:44:39.941 --> 01:44:41.693
A lady walked into traffic.

01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:45.530
Beatrice, get in the car.

01:44:45.697 --> 01:44:47.282
Giancarlo, help her.

01:44:48.825 --> 01:44:51.077
The ambulance is on its way.

01:44:52.287 --> 01:44:55.456
Give her some space, all right.

01:44:56.582 --> 01:44:59.294
- Isn't there another lady?
- Right here.

01:45:00.795 --> 01:45:02.839
She had a pink dress on.

01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:06.301
The lady in the pink dress
who was right here...

01:45:06.843 --> 01:45:09.178
where'd she go? She was just here.

01:45:19.188 --> 01:45:22.108
What a night, we had a blast.

01:46:22.502 --> 01:46:24.504
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:46:28.299 --> 01:46:29.675
How are you doing?

01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:32.428
Uh... normal.

01:46:34.889 --> 01:46:37.058
Normal...

01:46:37.642 --> 01:46:40.686
Well, you look pretty good for normal.

01:46:45.691 --> 01:46:47.693
Do you know who I am?

01:46:48.569 --> 01:46:51.322
The lady who was hiding in the plants.

01:46:56.077 --> 01:46:59.205
- You know when your back tingles?
- Yeah...

01:47:00.331 --> 01:47:03.209
That's me tickling you.

01:47:04.293 --> 01:47:06.212
It tickles at night.

01:47:08.089 --> 01:47:11.426
That means I think about you
even more at night.

01:47:15.054 --> 01:47:17.598
I have sand in my bathing suit.

01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:26.482
Hey you,
come in, it's not that cold!

01:47:59.724 --> 01:48:01.267
You're great!

01:48:29.295 --> 01:48:30.755
Where'll you go now?

01:48:31.672 --> 01:48:33.883
I don't know.

01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:37.386
I'll go somewhere to get better,
so one day...

01:48:39.639 --> 01:48:42.016
we'll be able to meet again.

01:48:45.436 --> 01:48:49.315
I'm happy, you have a lovely family.

01:48:58.032 --> 01:49:01.202
Elia, come play volleyball.

01:49:01.327 --> 01:49:04.789
- What a drag, I'm so short.
- No you're not.

01:49:06.457 --> 01:49:10.211
I'll come play on
Luca and Tommaso's team!

01:49:12.171 --> 01:49:14.549
We're just late bloomers...

01:49:18.344 --> 01:49:20.805
Giulia, do a good serve!

01:49:22.598 --> 01:49:24.350
Serve strong!

01:49:42.118 --> 01:49:44.829
Guys, zero to one in our favor!

01:49:47.248 --> 01:49:49.250
Good job!

01:52:07.138 --> 01:52:12.017
LIKE CRAZY
