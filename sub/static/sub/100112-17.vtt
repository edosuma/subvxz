00:03.289 --> 00:06.990
Okay, Grandma Bev's flight
landed two hours ago.

00:06.992 --> 00:10.562
We can't just wish this away.
Someone's got to go get her.

00:11.368 --> 00:13.468
You're making too big
a deal out of this.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.003
She's just gonna catch a cab,

00:15.005 --> 00:17.845
and all we have to do is
turn off all the lights,

00:17.847 --> 00:19.440
duck beneath the windowsills,

00:19.442 --> 00:21.977
and remain motionless for several days.

00:22.912 --> 00:23.945
My dad will go.

00:23.947 --> 00:25.249
- Mary.
- What?

00:25.251 --> 00:26.317
This morning, you said,

00:26.319 --> 00:27.808
"They'll probably make me pick up Bev".

00:27.810 --> 00:29.032
No, I didn't.

00:29.034 --> 00:30.156
Yes, you did.

00:30.158 --> 00:32.156
Right before you said you
hope you outlast everybody

00:32.158 --> 00:34.024
so you can pull all the plugs.

00:34.026 --> 00:35.760
Hmm.

00:35.762 --> 00:38.096
Hey, why don't I go pick up Bev?

00:39.265 --> 00:42.601
I suppose you all forgot to pick me up.

00:46.903 --> 00:53.408
I was a 94-year-old woman
alone at the airport.

00:53.410 --> 00:55.511
I had to take a rideshare.

00:56.980 --> 01:01.183
I could have been dragged
into a sex-trafficking ring!

01:03.386 --> 01:05.620
Well, if anything's gonna
put an end to sex trafficking,

01:05.622 --> 01:07.455
that's it.

01:07.457 --> 01:09.424
Hi, Nana Bev.

01:09.426 --> 01:11.025
Ah!

01:11.027 --> 01:13.494
That's a fun cactus shirt.

01:13.496 --> 01:14.996
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:14.998 --> 01:16.213
Yeah, you picked something

01:16.215 --> 01:18.099
that inflicts pain when you touch it.

01:18.101 --> 01:20.101
That makes sense.

01:20.103 --> 01:21.602
Nana!

01:21.604 --> 01:23.038
Harris.

01:25.241 --> 01:27.275
Well, this has been a nice visit.

01:27.277 --> 01:28.443
Now that we're all caught up,

01:28.445 --> 01:30.178
DJ will take you back to the airport.

01:30.180 --> 01:32.747
Oh, it seems you're all too busy

01:32.749 --> 01:35.328
to hear about the large sum of money

01:35.330 --> 01:36.718
I intend to give away.

01:38.421 --> 01:40.688
Nice try, Nana Bev.

01:40.690 --> 01:43.758
This is obviously a ploy
to make us be nice to you.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.094
We all know you don't
control your money.

01:46.096 --> 01:48.062
Darlene's got power of attorney.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.199
You can't fool us, you old bat.

01:51.267 --> 01:55.236
Actually, I've already
submitted legal papers

01:55.238 --> 01:56.971
to remove Darlene

01:56.973 --> 02:00.975
and regain my control
over my own finances.

02:00.977 --> 02:02.076
Oh, no.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.711
Now what will take up
all of my spare time

02:03.713 --> 02:06.280
and cause my family to resent me?

02:06.282 --> 02:09.518
Anyway, I intend to be very generous.

02:10.387 --> 02:12.987
You know, Nana, the bat is considered

02:12.989 --> 02:16.324
the wise old owl of the
flying rodent kingdom.

02:16.326 --> 02:18.827
No. It's not.

02:20.196 --> 02:22.196
While I was in Arizona,

02:22.198 --> 02:26.934
I realized what really matters
in this world... family...

02:26.936 --> 02:30.506
the people I've loved so
dearly and for so long.

02:32.475 --> 02:33.942
You have another family?

02:35.178 --> 02:37.913
Oh, Danny.

02:39.382 --> 02:40.715
I just don't want to die

02:40.717 --> 02:42.917
with sacks of money under the bed.

02:42.919 --> 02:46.821
I want to use it all
now to spread happiness.

02:46.823 --> 02:49.377
Well, you've been doing it
the other way for so long,

02:49.379 --> 02:51.893
you might as well try this.

02:51.895 --> 02:55.263
I want to invest in the
future of this family...

02:55.265 --> 02:56.287
the children.

02:56.289 --> 02:58.390
And when I say children, I mean Mark.

03:00.503 --> 03:01.969
Just Mark?

03:01.971 --> 03:03.337
I was away for months,

03:03.339 --> 03:06.007
and I never heard a
peep from any of you,

03:06.009 --> 03:07.275
except Mark.

03:07.277 --> 03:11.012
Mark has been writing
me letters twice a week.

03:11.014 --> 03:12.281
What a suck-up.

03:13.349 --> 03:15.149
I would have written you a letter

03:15.151 --> 03:17.185
if I knew you'd give me money.

03:17.187 --> 03:20.488
Look, I-I'm glad
you're giving it to Mark,

03:20.490 --> 03:22.056
but what about the other kids?

03:22.058 --> 03:24.225
I don't mean to make
a big deal about this,

03:24.227 --> 03:27.328
but I can tell you now, um...

03:27.330 --> 03:30.031
Beverly Rose said her
first word the other day.

03:30.033 --> 03:31.399
It was...

03:31.401 --> 03:33.335
"I love Nana Bev".

03:34.804 --> 03:39.073
Really? I barely know her.

03:39.075 --> 03:41.976
Mark is getting money because
he's been accepted into

03:41.978 --> 03:44.078
"Camp of the Future".

03:45.181 --> 03:47.181
Oh, well, that's great.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.439
Is there anything else I don't know?

03:48.441 --> 03:51.118
Are you married? You got kids?

03:51.120 --> 03:52.553
I didn't tell you because I knew

03:52.555 --> 03:54.021
you couldn't afford to send me.

03:54.023 --> 03:56.105
It's a coding camp at Northwestern.

03:56.107 --> 03:59.832
Mark worked hard to get
himself into that camp,

03:59.834 --> 04:04.499
and I'm going to give him
$5,000 to cover his tuition.

04:04.501 --> 04:06.767
Wow! Thank you!

04:06.769 --> 04:09.203
This is completely unfair, Nana.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.438
Oh, you'll be fine.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.207
You have a pretty face and a nice shape.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.876
If you learn to talk a little less,

04:14.878 --> 04:18.245
you'll land a man
who'll take care of you.

04:18.248 --> 04:19.613
Well, that's a bunch of crap.

04:19.616 --> 04:22.050
Mark's gonna land a
man before I ever do.

05:00.308 --> 05:02.265
"The Conners" is recorded

05:02.267 --> 05:03.991
in front of a live studio audience.

05:03.993 --> 05:05.359
Hey, can I talk to you

05:05.361 --> 05:07.095
- for a moment?
- Uh... Uh...

05:09.499 --> 05:12.400
Look, I do really appreciate

05:12.402 --> 05:13.935
that you gave Mark the money,

05:13.937 --> 05:15.503
but I want to talk to you about Harris.

05:15.505 --> 05:17.972
Oh, I know all about Harris.

05:17.974 --> 05:19.507
She lost her job,

05:19.509 --> 05:23.311
and then her friend, the Weed Hoe,

05:23.313 --> 05:25.446
threw her out,

05:25.448 --> 05:28.683
and now she's sweeping up bits of skin

05:28.685 --> 05:31.285
at a seedy tattoo parlor.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.945
It's not seedy.

05:32.947 --> 05:34.603
It's at the farthest
end of the strip mall

05:34.605 --> 05:36.657
next to Massage Envy.

05:36.659 --> 05:39.594
And this is more than
just a job for Harris.

05:39.596 --> 05:42.011
I mean, the artist
there says she has talent

05:42.013 --> 05:44.365
and she would do great in tattoo school.

05:44.367 --> 05:46.167
Tattoos?

05:46.169 --> 05:47.668
You don't need school for that.

05:47.670 --> 05:49.604
All you need is a drunken sailor

05:49.606 --> 05:52.107
and something sharp to poke him with.

05:53.743 --> 05:57.578
I think it would be fair if
you gave both kids $5,000.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.914
I've seen your accounts.
I know you have it.

05:59.916 --> 06:01.616
It's my money.

06:01.618 --> 06:03.851
$5,000 or nothing at all.

06:03.853 --> 06:08.356
Fine. Have it your way. $5,000 for each.

06:09.382 --> 06:12.350
It's not a Bugs Bunny cartoon, Darlene.

06:13.496 --> 06:18.432
Alright, uh, if you can
only give it to one, then...

06:18.434 --> 06:20.301
I mean, I guess you
should give it to Harris.

06:20.303 --> 06:22.169
Tattooing is a real career.

06:22.171 --> 06:24.071
She could make, like, $100,000 a year

06:24.073 --> 06:26.073
and have her own business someday.

06:26.075 --> 06:29.099
Mark's only 12, and he's got time.

06:29.101 --> 06:31.312
Harris really needs the help right now.

06:31.314 --> 06:33.555
Well, I suppose if she can make

06:33.557 --> 06:36.217
a real living with this,

06:36.219 --> 06:38.319
I have to think about it.

06:38.321 --> 06:39.854
I appreciate that.

06:39.856 --> 06:43.158
Truth be told, I have a small tattoo.

06:44.894 --> 06:48.262
I got it the day the
Japanese surrendered.

06:48.264 --> 06:49.530
I can't show you

06:49.532 --> 06:53.434
because now-a-days,
it's considered "racist".

06:53.436 --> 06:54.602
But you might see it

06:54.604 --> 06:58.173
if I ever need help getting off the pot.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.347
So, Anne-Marie says I
gotta take the probiotics.

07:06.349 --> 07:09.383
Now, a month ago, she was riding
me to finish my antibiotics.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.486
I wish she'd make up her damn mind.

07:12.455 --> 07:14.388
That's why we stay single, right, Dan?

07:14.390 --> 07:18.259
We take what pills we
want to when we want to.

07:18.261 --> 07:20.117
He's single because he wants to be.

07:20.119 --> 07:22.107
You're single because
all the women in the world

07:22.109 --> 07:23.297
had a meeting.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.701
So, uh, any word from Louise, Dan?

07:26.703 --> 07:28.135
She's on tour. That's all I know.

07:28.137 --> 07:30.071
Man, I'd love to catch
her band sometime.

07:30.073 --> 07:32.173
She's playing two nights in Springfield,

07:32.175 --> 07:33.708
then she hits Peoria for a day,

07:33.710 --> 07:35.098
Champaign for a college gig,

07:35.100 --> 07:36.343
and that's where
they're putting "Proud Mary"

07:36.345 --> 07:38.479
back in the set list.

07:38.481 --> 07:40.948
I thought you unfollowed her
on Instagram when she left.

07:40.950 --> 07:43.084
I tried, but I'm no good at that.

07:43.086 --> 07:45.020
I ended up following six more Louises.

07:46.489 --> 07:49.323
Oh, this Louise is redoing her kitchen.

07:49.325 --> 07:52.793
She decided on this gray
tile that looks like wood.

07:52.795 --> 07:54.095
Ah.

07:54.097 --> 07:56.364
That does warm up the space.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.601
So, which is the real Louise?

08:01.304 --> 08:03.871
Wow! You let her get away?

08:03.873 --> 08:05.706
You? Her?

08:05.708 --> 08:06.997
This woman's beautiful.

08:06.999 --> 08:09.243
This is the kind of photo
the uggos post online

08:09.245 --> 08:11.279
to catfish hotties like me.

08:12.782 --> 08:15.683
She's not just good-lookin',
she's a great person.

08:15.685 --> 08:17.566
Unfortunately, it didn't work out.

08:17.568 --> 08:19.954
I'm okay with that.

08:19.956 --> 08:21.489
I'm fine on my own.

08:21.491 --> 08:24.191
Old men don't do well on their own, Dan.

08:24.193 --> 08:26.861
All I'm saying is I've
seen you with Louise, Dan.

08:26.863 --> 08:29.731
You guys are #couplegoals.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.701
Well, uh, I don't know
what the hell that means,

08:33.703 --> 08:38.472
but I think I know
what Dan's problem is.

08:38.474 --> 08:41.375
I think he's afraid of being
disappointing in the sack.

08:41.376 --> 08:43.299
I don't think there's a problem there.

08:43.302 --> 08:47.181
My mom and dad had a very active
and unnaturally loud sex life.

08:47.183 --> 08:48.883
This is not... This is different.

08:48.885 --> 08:50.885
Your dad was with your mom for 45 years.

08:50.887 --> 08:53.988
It's got to be a little scary
starting up with someone new.

08:53.990 --> 08:55.456
Oh, don't worry, Dan.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.024
There's less pressure these days.

08:57.026 --> 08:59.527
Women know what they
want and how to get it.

08:59.529 --> 09:03.131
I've been asked to step out
of the room multiple times.

09:11.674 --> 09:12.763
What are you doing here?

09:12.765 --> 09:15.867
I had to see the drain
my money went down.

09:17.814 --> 09:21.048
Was this really worth
breaking up the family for?

09:21.050 --> 09:22.850
Well, I was hoping it
would break up the family,

09:22.852 --> 09:24.986
but here you are.

09:26.589 --> 09:28.622
- Hi, Nana Bev. Here's some tea.
- Ah.

09:28.624 --> 09:30.391
So, they've got you working here, too?

09:30.393 --> 09:31.692
Well, I like helping out.

09:31.694 --> 09:33.427
Oh, I want to show you this brochure

09:33.429 --> 09:34.528
for the coding camp.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.563
When we're finished,

09:35.565 --> 09:37.264
we'll have our own app and video game.

09:37.266 --> 09:39.567
That sounds lovely.

09:40.937 --> 09:43.504
But you shouldn't get ahead of yourself.

09:43.506 --> 09:44.605
What do you mean?

09:44.607 --> 09:47.741
You should know your mother asked me

09:47.743 --> 09:50.044
to give your money to Harris.

09:50.046 --> 09:51.478
What?

09:51.480 --> 09:53.347
Why would she do that?

09:53.349 --> 09:55.449
She feels that Harris needs it more.

09:55.451 --> 09:57.017
She's very emphatic.

09:57.019 --> 09:59.620
That's not fair.

09:59.622 --> 10:03.924
Well, that's between you
and your mother, isn't it?

10:03.926 --> 10:05.527
I got to go.

10:10.633 --> 10:13.500
No one's taken my
order, and I'm starving.

10:13.502 --> 10:16.304
Do you mind if I have your pickle?

10:19.742 --> 10:21.809
Oh, it's a Dill.

10:21.811 --> 10:23.344
I prefer a Bread and Butter.

10:23.346 --> 10:25.180
You can have it back.

10:30.708 --> 10:33.176
Hey, Mark. Who makes a better cover...

10:33.178 --> 10:35.812
stabby meth lady or heroin Easter bunny?

10:37.649 --> 10:39.615
Nana Bev told me that you asked her

10:39.617 --> 10:42.218
to give my camp money to Harris.

10:42.220 --> 10:43.586
Oh, my God.

10:43.588 --> 10:45.288
I can't believe her.

10:45.290 --> 10:48.724
No, look, I told her to give
both of you money,

10:48.726 --> 10:50.660
and she said only one
of you could get it.

10:50.662 --> 10:52.995
A-And Harris is really
struggling lately.

10:52.997 --> 10:55.565
Oh, really? I hadn't heard.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.634
It's just the only thing
you ever talk about!

10:58.570 --> 11:00.870
You're such a sucker for all her BS.

11:00.872 --> 11:03.673
W-Wait. I understand why
you're mad, honey, okay?

11:03.675 --> 11:06.532
But this is a really
critical moment for Harris.

11:06.534 --> 11:07.777
She's finally figured out

11:07.779 --> 11:09.212
what she wants to do with her life

11:09.214 --> 11:11.280
after being lost for so long.

11:11.282 --> 11:13.583
O-Okay, let me make sure I understand.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.718
I came to you saying all I ever hear is,

11:15.720 --> 11:17.499
"Poor Harris, poor Harris".

11:17.501 --> 11:21.437
And you defended yourself
by saying, "Poor Harris".

11:22.910 --> 11:24.500
Okay, yeah, I just heard it.

11:24.502 --> 11:26.358
Uh-huh.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.080
But you know what?
Maybe you can go next summer.

11:29.082 --> 11:30.348
I can save a little,

11:30.350 --> 11:31.916
and I-I bet they have scholarships.

11:31.918 --> 11:33.518
You're so smart and talented,

11:33.520 --> 11:35.586
I am sure that you'll qualify.

11:35.588 --> 11:38.523
You always say that
I'm so smart and talented

11:38.525 --> 11:39.891
and that things will work out.

11:39.893 --> 11:41.426
What if they don't?

11:41.428 --> 11:43.227
You never think about me.

11:43.229 --> 11:45.229
Oh, Mark, of course I do.

11:45.231 --> 11:47.432
Harris doesn't even need tattoo school.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.434
Tell her to make more pot cookies.

11:49.436 --> 11:50.552
Then she can go to prison

11:50.554 --> 11:52.821
and learn how to make tattoos there.

11:54.274 --> 11:57.308
You don't go to prison
for weed anymore, idiot.

11:57.310 --> 11:58.443
What's your problem?

11:58.445 --> 12:01.245
Mom told Nana Bev to give you my money.

12:01.247 --> 12:03.782
Really? Aw, thanks, Mom.

12:05.452 --> 12:07.585
I'm used to not getting
things I deserve,

12:07.587 --> 12:09.787
but this is the first
time I've had something

12:09.789 --> 12:11.756
and you've taken it away.

12:17.507 --> 12:19.530
You know, you've been out
here working on that bike

12:19.532 --> 12:21.632
since 1988.

12:21.634 --> 12:23.234
Is it ever gonna be done?

12:23.236 --> 12:25.536
It's not about finishing,

12:25.538 --> 12:28.639
it's about the zen of...
Oh, how should I put this?...

12:28.641 --> 12:31.243
not talking to you guys.

12:32.278 --> 12:34.964
DJ told us you left the
poker game last night

12:34.966 --> 12:36.422
because the guys were going on

12:36.424 --> 12:38.449
about you...

12:38.451 --> 12:40.585
having sex with Louise.

12:40.587 --> 12:42.653
If I had done paper instead of scissors,

12:42.655 --> 12:44.021
Darlene would be here.

12:45.492 --> 12:49.026
It wasn't about... that.

12:49.028 --> 12:50.595
That's not why I left.

12:50.597 --> 12:51.730
Oh, thank God.

12:52.899 --> 12:54.632
So, what's going on?

12:54.634 --> 12:57.294
The guys were talking
about how bad I screwed up,

12:57.296 --> 12:59.370
and they're right.

12:59.372 --> 13:01.540
I miss her, okay? I miss Louise.

13:02.509 --> 13:04.041
That's not a bad thing.

13:04.043 --> 13:05.476
Yes, it is,

13:05.478 --> 13:07.645
because every time I think about

13:07.647 --> 13:09.281
the things I'd be doing with her...

13:09.283 --> 13:11.297
going to concerts,
bowling a few games...

13:11.299 --> 13:12.850
anything fun,

13:12.852 --> 13:16.677
I feel guilty because I was supposed
to be doing that with your mom.

13:16.679 --> 13:19.769
So, you're worried that
Mom is somehow watching you,

13:19.771 --> 13:21.794
and if she sees you
happy with someone else,

13:21.796 --> 13:23.310
she'll be angry or something?

13:23.312 --> 13:25.732
'Cause she'd want you to be happy.

13:25.734 --> 13:27.467
Oh, no, no, no.

13:27.469 --> 13:29.936
She made it very clear
that if she went first,

13:29.938 --> 13:33.139
she wanted me to be miserable
for the rest of my life.

13:33.141 --> 13:35.542
Well, that does sound like her.

13:39.481 --> 13:41.581
She's here.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.516
A paint can?

13:43.518 --> 13:44.584
That's not Mom.

13:44.586 --> 13:46.319
Mom's more of a

13:46.321 --> 13:48.087
shovel-to-the-head kind of gal.

13:51.793 --> 13:55.628
I thought it'd be
easier as time went on.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.764
It's not.

13:57.766 --> 13:59.732
Yeah, I get it.

13:59.734 --> 14:03.169
I went through something
like this after I lost Mark.

14:03.171 --> 14:05.430
Right now, you think
Mom's not really dead,

14:05.432 --> 14:06.839
she's just not here,

14:06.841 --> 14:10.377
and she might walk
through that door any time.

14:12.814 --> 14:15.315
You're afraid that if
you commit to Louise,

14:15.317 --> 14:18.619
you'll be admitting
that Mom's gone forever.

14:21.089 --> 14:23.791
I know she's gone forever.

14:26.094 --> 14:28.499
Why don't you find out where
Louise's band is playing

14:28.501 --> 14:29.829
and go see her?

14:29.831 --> 14:31.864
I messed up pretty bad.

14:31.866 --> 14:33.733
I'm not even sure she'd want to see me.

14:33.735 --> 14:37.570
You know, maybe she misses you, too.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.806
There's only one way to know for sure.

14:41.343 --> 14:43.644
Well, I do know where she is.

14:44.746 --> 14:47.513
Along with six other Louises.

14:47.515 --> 14:49.139
Hey, one of them has a taco stand

14:49.141 --> 14:50.784
I might hit up on the way out.

15:01.607 --> 15:03.296
... with a few sunny breaks...

15:03.298 --> 15:05.899
Why is my bag sitting on the porch?

15:07.268 --> 15:09.603
It wouldn't fit in the fireplace.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.431
What did I do now?

15:13.433 --> 15:16.275
You threw me under the bus with Mark.

15:16.277 --> 15:18.911
Why would you tell him
about our conversation?

15:18.913 --> 15:20.880
I thought he deserved to know.

15:20.882 --> 15:24.250
I-I can't believe I trusted you

15:24.252 --> 15:25.752
to keep this between us.

15:25.754 --> 15:27.987
God, it's so easy to be taken in by you

15:27.989 --> 15:31.691
when you're not wearing
your Dalmatian puppy coat.

15:31.693 --> 15:34.260
I trusted you first.

15:34.262 --> 15:37.207
You knew I didn't want the
Lunch Box to go to Jackie,

15:37.209 --> 15:39.966
and you gave it to her anyway.

15:39.968 --> 15:42.702
Oh, my God.

15:42.704 --> 15:45.238
So you told Mark just to punish me?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.659
Did you ever stop to
think for one second

15:47.661 --> 15:49.041
what that might do to him?

15:49.043 --> 15:52.846
There's no reason for hysterics.

15:57.118 --> 15:58.251
After all that,

15:58.253 --> 16:00.052
you're still giving the money to Mark?

16:00.054 --> 16:01.954
Of course.

16:01.956 --> 16:03.790
I know which horse to put my money on,

16:03.792 --> 16:07.694
and it's not the horse
tattooing other horses.

16:08.997 --> 16:11.431
So you made Mark hate me,

16:11.433 --> 16:13.399
and then after getting
Harris's hopes up,

16:13.401 --> 16:14.901
I have to break her heart?

16:14.903 --> 16:16.803
Well, clearly

16:16.805 --> 16:20.239
you've handled the situation poorly.

16:20.241 --> 16:22.809
Get out of my house!

16:22.811 --> 16:25.077
You don't have a house, Darlene.

16:25.079 --> 16:26.913
It's Dan's house.

16:26.915 --> 16:29.816
And I won't leave until Dan tells me to.

16:29.818 --> 16:32.185
Dan, here's what happened.

16:32.187 --> 16:33.720
Get out.

16:38.282 --> 16:39.805
What's up?

16:39.807 --> 16:42.441
Oh, can everyone sit down for a moment?

16:42.443 --> 16:45.178
There's something I need
to discuss with all of you.

16:46.314 --> 16:51.050
I am thinking of settling
the score with Grandma Bev.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.853
I'm in. I'll get the shovel.

16:54.656 --> 16:57.507
Alright, I still have
her power of attorney

16:57.509 --> 16:58.824
until Monday morning.

16:58.826 --> 17:02.006
So I'm gonna pull $5,000
out of this account

17:02.008 --> 17:03.262
and give it to Harris.

17:03.264 --> 17:06.145
All I need to do is click this button.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.768
Am I doing the right thing?

17:08.770 --> 17:10.904
Absolutely not.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.929
There's no reason to stop at $5,000.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.464
Clean her out.

17:16.210 --> 17:18.844
No. I'm just taking
enough to make this right.

17:18.846 --> 17:22.883
Let's make it so right
she's got newspaper shoes.

17:24.519 --> 17:27.586
Hey, criminal masterminds.
Keep your voices down.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.355
Why are we ripping off Nana Bev?

17:29.357 --> 17:31.683
Because she was never
gonna give you the money.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.392
It was always going to Mark.

17:33.394 --> 17:34.827
Wow.

17:34.829 --> 17:36.629
I'm just evening things up.

17:36.631 --> 17:38.030
Well, I appreciate the sentiment,

17:38.032 --> 17:40.766
but it's not worth going to jail for.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.603
You are a little small
for women's prison.

17:44.972 --> 17:49.508
Yeah. They would pass me
around like a bag of popcorn.

17:49.510 --> 17:51.977
But it's just not fair
the way she treated you.

17:51.979 --> 17:54.213
I mean, she deserves to be punished.

17:54.215 --> 17:55.581
We need to be above this.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.849
Two wrongs don't make a right.

17:56.851 --> 17:59.286
Don't listen to her. She's a child!

18:00.555 --> 18:03.122
She doesn't understand
how the world works.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.223
Eye for an eye.

18:04.225 --> 18:05.691
Hit the button, Darlene!

18:05.693 --> 18:07.287
Hey, no, no, no, no.

18:07.289 --> 18:08.561
I'm not gonna do that.

18:08.563 --> 18:10.663
I want her to know that I forgive her.

18:10.665 --> 18:11.697
She's my Nana.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.467
I wanna become her
friend, earn her trust.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.736
And then, once she leaves
me everything in her will,

18:16.738 --> 18:18.572
I'll take her for a
stroll in her wheelchair.

18:19.941 --> 18:22.675
And as I slowly push
her into Lake Michigan,

18:22.677 --> 18:25.979
I'll whisper that her wheelchair
backpack is filled with bricks.

18:27.048 --> 18:28.748
Harris, you're mad,

18:28.750 --> 18:30.583
and you're not thinking clearly.

18:30.585 --> 18:32.652
You don't need to work
that hard. She can't swim.

18:39.694 --> 18:42.161
Hey. How was Model UN?

18:42.163 --> 18:44.664
It's hopeless, even on a model level.

18:46.234 --> 18:47.800
I have something for you.

18:47.802 --> 18:49.669
Oh, great! I hope Harris likes it!

18:53.141 --> 18:55.308
Just look at it.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.545
I thought Harris was getting the money.

18:59.547 --> 19:01.546
Nana Bev was always
gonna give it to you.

19:01.548 --> 19:02.715
She was just mad at me,

19:02.717 --> 19:04.583
and you got caught in the middle.

19:04.585 --> 19:06.029
So nothing for Harris?

19:06.031 --> 19:07.119
Poor Harris.

19:07.121 --> 19:09.722
Now I'm saying it.

19:09.724 --> 19:12.792
See? It comes very naturally.

19:12.794 --> 19:16.262
Listen, I heard what you said earlier,

19:16.264 --> 19:17.630
and you're right.

19:17.632 --> 19:19.031
You know, you're doing so great

19:19.033 --> 19:20.199
that that's probably why

19:20.201 --> 19:22.768
I don't pay enough attention
to you all the time.

19:22.770 --> 19:23.969
So, if you could jack a car

19:23.971 --> 19:25.204
or rob a liquor store or something,

19:25.206 --> 19:26.672
remind me you're around.

19:26.674 --> 19:29.142
Super funny, Mom.

19:30.524 --> 19:32.478
I really am proud of you, you know,

19:32.480 --> 19:35.614
for getting in that camp
and for how hard you work.

19:35.616 --> 19:37.783
I never mean to take that for granted.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.219
I'm sorry.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.321
Hey.

19:42.323 --> 19:44.123
Can I get a hug?

19:44.125 --> 19:45.724
I'm not going to hold a grudge

19:45.726 --> 19:47.026
because that's not healthy,

19:47.028 --> 19:49.728
but I'll hug you when I'm ready.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.168
Can I help you?

20:29.170 --> 20:32.671
Yeah, I-I know Louise.
I'd like to say hi.

20:32.673 --> 20:33.974
Yeah, alright.

20:49.624 --> 20:53.248
And since my great-granddaughter
forgave me,

20:53.250 --> 20:55.091
I told her I would support her

20:55.093 --> 20:57.585
by patronizing your tattoo parlor.

20:57.587 --> 20:59.855
We're besties now.

21:02.926 --> 21:04.592
So what are you looking for, Bev?

21:04.594 --> 21:06.427
I have an old tattoo,

21:06.429 --> 21:09.764
and I've been embarrassed
by it for many years now,

21:09.766 --> 21:12.433
and I hope to make it less offensive.

21:12.435 --> 21:16.237
Oh. Ooh! That is offensive.

21:16.239 --> 21:17.605
Is there any way

21:17.607 --> 21:20.560
we can turn the soldier into Kenny G

21:20.562 --> 21:22.839
and the rifle into an alto sax?

21:22.841 --> 21:24.675
I adore Kenny G.
