01:45.515 --> 01:46.607
Yes, sweetheart?

01:46.683 --> 01:49.277
There's a girl wants to see you.
Her name's Wonderly.

01:49.352 --> 01:50.376
A customer?

01:50.453 --> 01:53.650
I guess so. You'll want to see her, anyway.
She's a knockout.

01:53.723 --> 01:56.556
Shoo her in, Effie, darling. Shoo her in.

01:59.829 --> 02:02.161
Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?

02:02.532 --> 02:03.931
Thank you.

02:08.270 --> 02:10.865
- Won't you sit down, Miss Wonderly?
- Thank you.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.841
I inquired at the hotel for the name
of a reliable private detective.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.104
They mentioned yours.

02:15.178 --> 02:18.011
Suppose you tell me about it
from the very beginning.

02:18.081 --> 02:19.742
I'm from New York.

02:20.550 --> 02:22.415
I'm trying to find my sister.

02:22.619 --> 02:24.678
I have reason to believe
that she's here in San Francisco

02:24.754 --> 02:27.917
with a man by the name of Thursby,
Floyd Thursby.

02:28.925 --> 02:30.950
I don't know where she met him.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.894
We've never been as close
as sisters ought to be.

02:33.963 --> 02:35.760
If we had,
perhaps Corinne would have told me

02:35.832 --> 02:37.493
that she was planning on
running away with him.

02:37.567 --> 02:38.761
Mother and Father are in Honolulu.

02:38.835 --> 02:41.065
It would kill them. I've got to
find her before they get back home.

02:41.137 --> 02:42.365
They're coming home
the first of the month.

02:42.438 --> 02:44.065
You've had word of your sister?

02:44.140 --> 02:46.438
A letter from her about two weeks ago.

02:46.509 --> 02:48.909
It said nothing
except that she was all right.

02:48.978 --> 02:51.173
I sent her a telegram,
begging her to come home.

02:51.247 --> 02:54.182
I sent it to General Delivery here.
That was the only address she gave me.

02:54.250 --> 02:57.811
I waited a week and no answer came,
so I decided to come out here myself.

02:57.887 --> 03:00.822
I wrote her that I was coming.
I shouldn't have done that, should I?

03:00.890 --> 03:03.256
It's not always easy to know what to do.

03:03.326 --> 03:04.725
You haven't found her?

03:04.794 --> 03:08.890
No. I told her in my letter that I'd be at
the St. Mark and for her to meet me there.

03:08.965 --> 03:12.833
I waited three whole days. She didn't
come. Didn't even send a message.

03:13.269 --> 03:15.134
It was horrible, waiting.

03:15.805 --> 03:17.534
I sent her another letter
to General Delivery.

03:17.607 --> 03:19.939
Yesterday afternoon,
I went to the post office.

03:20.009 --> 03:23.308
Corinne didn't call for her mail,
but Floyd Thursby did.

03:23.379 --> 03:25.779
He wouldn't tell me where Corinne was.

03:25.848 --> 03:27.873
He said she didn't want to see me.

03:27.951 --> 03:29.475
I can't believe that.

03:29.552 --> 03:31.986
He promised to bring her to the hotel,
if she'd come, this evening.

03:32.055 --> 03:36.389
He said he knew she wouldn't.
He promised to come himself if she didn't.

03:37.060 --> 03:38.288
Excuse me.

03:38.428 --> 03:41.090
It's all right, Miles. Come in.

03:41.164 --> 03:43.860
Miss Wonderly, my partner, Miles Archer.

03:44.033 --> 03:45.933
Miss Wonderly's sister
ran away from New York

03:46.002 --> 03:47.469
with a fellow named Floyd Thursby.

03:47.537 --> 03:49.300
They're here in San Francisco.

03:49.372 --> 03:51.704
Miss Wonderly has seen Thursby
and has a date to meet him tonight.

03:51.774 --> 03:54.504
Maybe he'll bring the sister with him.
The chances are he won't.

03:54.577 --> 03:58.479
Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister,
get her away from him and back home.

03:58.548 --> 03:59.947
- Right?
- Yes.

04:01.651 --> 04:04.882
Now, it's simply a matter of having a man
at the hotel this evening

04:04.954 --> 04:07.388
to shadow him when he leads us
to your sister.

04:07.457 --> 04:10.722
If, after we've found her,
she still doesn't want to leave him,

04:10.793 --> 04:13.353
- well, we have ways of managing that.
- Yeah.

04:13.429 --> 04:14.623
But you must be careful.

04:14.697 --> 04:17.188
I'm deathly afraid of him,
of what he might do.

04:17.267 --> 04:20.031
She's so young, and his bringing her here
from New York is such a serious...

04:20.103 --> 04:22.367
Mightn't he do something to her?

04:22.438 --> 04:24.838
Now, just leave that to us.
We'll know how to handle him.

04:24.907 --> 04:27.273
But I want you to know
he's a dangerous man.

04:27.343 --> 04:29.834
I honestly don't think
he'd stop at anything.

04:29.912 --> 04:33.507
I don't think he'd hesitate to kill Corinne
if he thought it would save him.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.983
Could he cover up by marrying her?

04:36.052 --> 04:38.577
He has a wife and three children
in England.

04:38.655 --> 04:42.250
Yes, they usually do, though not always
in England. What's he look like?

04:42.325 --> 04:45.158
He has dark hair
and thick, bushy eyebrows.

04:45.728 --> 04:47.457
He talks in a loud, blustery manner.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.794
He gives the impression
of being a violent person.

04:49.866 --> 04:53.632
He was wearing a light gray suit and
a gray hat when I saw him this morning.

04:53.703 --> 04:56.729
- What does he do for a living?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

04:56.806 --> 04:59.297
- What time's he coming to see you?
- After 8:00.

04:59.375 --> 05:02.310
All right, Miss Wonderly.
We'll have a man there.

05:02.378 --> 05:04.403
I'll look after it myself.

05:05.048 --> 05:06.345
Thank you.

05:08.685 --> 05:10.016
Oh, yes.

05:20.930 --> 05:22.625
Will that be enough?

05:23.700 --> 05:25.600
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

05:26.002 --> 05:28.698
It'll help some if you meet Thursby
in the lobby.

05:28.771 --> 05:30.500
- I will.
- You don't have to look for me.

05:30.573 --> 05:33.007
- I'll see you all right.
- Thank you.

05:40.283 --> 05:42.478
- Thank you so much.
- Goodbye.

05:46.956 --> 05:48.787
They're right enough.

05:49.158 --> 05:51.319
They have brothers in her bag.

05:51.561 --> 05:54.257
- What do you think of her?
- She's sweet.

05:54.931 --> 05:58.059
Maybe you saw her first, Sam,
but I spoke first.

05:58.968 --> 06:00.560
You've got brains.

06:01.838 --> 06:03.271
Yes, you have.

06:30.733 --> 06:31.927
Hello?

06:33.636 --> 06:35.126
Yeah. Speaking.

06:36.305 --> 06:38.000
Miles Archer dead?

06:39.208 --> 06:40.368
Where?

06:41.978 --> 06:43.639
Bush and Stockton?

06:44.647 --> 06:45.739
Yeah.

06:46.182 --> 06:47.672
In 15 minutes.

06:48.651 --> 06:49.845
Thanks.

07:19.215 --> 07:20.705
Hello, Effie?

07:20.883 --> 07:22.077
It's me.

07:22.852 --> 07:24.581
Now, listen, precious.

07:24.654 --> 07:26.383
Miles has been shot.

07:26.823 --> 07:28.518
Yeah, dead.

07:29.826 --> 07:31.657
Now, don't get excited.

07:32.261 --> 07:33.319
Yeah.

07:35.031 --> 07:38.364
Now, you'll have to break the news to Iva.
I'd fry first.

07:38.868 --> 07:40.859
And keep her away from me.

07:42.205 --> 07:43.866
That's a good girl.

07:45.441 --> 07:47.409
Now get right over there.

07:48.444 --> 07:49.968
You're an angel.

07:50.913 --> 07:52.175
Bye.

08:04.827 --> 08:08.126
- What do you want here?
- I'm Sam Spade. Tom Polhaus phoned.

08:08.197 --> 08:11.166
I didn't know you at first.
They're back there.

08:34.390 --> 08:37.847
Hello, Sam. I figured you'd want to see it
before we took him away.

08:37.927 --> 08:39.417
Thanks, Tom. What happened?

08:39.495 --> 08:41.861
Got him right through the pump with this.

08:41.931 --> 08:43.296
It's a Webley.

08:43.765 --> 08:45.461
English, ain't it?

08:45.868 --> 08:49.235
Yeah. A Webley-Fosbery .45 automatic, 8-shot.
They don't make them anymore.

08:49.305 --> 08:51.739
- How many gone out of it?
- Just one.

08:51.974 --> 08:53.669
Let's see. Shot up here, huh?

08:53.743 --> 08:56.007
Standing like you are,
with his back to the fence.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.239
The man who shot him stood here.

08:58.447 --> 09:00.472
Went over backwards,
taking the top of the fence with him,

09:00.550 --> 09:02.677
and went on down the hill
and got caught on that rock. That it?

09:02.752 --> 09:04.583
That's it. The blast burnt his coat.

09:04.654 --> 09:06.884
- Who found him?
- Man on the beat.

09:07.290 --> 09:11.090
- Anybody hear the shot?
- Somebody must've. We just got here.

09:11.227 --> 09:13.661
You want to go down and have a look
at him before we take him away?

09:13.729 --> 09:15.924
No, you've seen everything I could.

09:15.998 --> 09:18.262
His gun was still tucked away on his hip.
Hadn't been fired.

09:18.334 --> 09:19.767
His overcoat was buttoned.

09:19.835 --> 09:23.601
I found a $100 bill in his vest pocket
and 30 some bucks in his pants.

09:23.673 --> 09:25.436
Was he working, Sam?

09:26.542 --> 09:27.668
Well?

09:27.743 --> 09:30.439
- He was tailing a guy named Thursby.
- What for?

09:31.214 --> 09:32.306
What for?

09:32.381 --> 09:35.612
He wanted to find out where he lived.
Don't crowd me, Tom.

09:36.185 --> 09:38.813
I'm going on down and break the news
to Miles' wife.

09:38.888 --> 09:41.618
It's tough, him getting it like that, ain't it?

09:41.691 --> 09:43.591
Miles had his faults,
just like any of the rest of us,

09:43.659 --> 09:46.856
but I guess he must've had
some good points, too, huh?

09:47.163 --> 09:48.494
I guess so.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.998
Miss Wonderly, please.

09:54.403 --> 09:56.303
Checked out? What time?

09:59.041 --> 10:00.838
Any forwarding address?

10:01.477 --> 10:02.637
Thanks.

10:37.413 --> 10:40.007
Hello, Tom. Hello, Lieutenant. Come in.

10:47.623 --> 10:48.851
Sit down.

10:53.162 --> 10:54.390
Sit down.

10:59.101 --> 11:00.261
Drink?

11:03.039 --> 11:05.735
Did you break the news
to Miles' wife, Sam?

11:06.042 --> 11:07.373
How'd she take it?

11:07.443 --> 11:09.809
- I don't know anything about women.
- Since when?

11:09.879 --> 11:11.369
What kind of a gun do you carry?

11:11.447 --> 11:14.075
None. I don't like them.
Course, there are some at the office.

11:14.150 --> 11:16.482
You don't happen to have one here?
You sure about that?

11:16.552 --> 11:18.645
Look around. Turn the dump upside down
if you want to.

11:18.721 --> 11:21.812
I won't squawk if you got a search warrant.
- We don't want to make any...

11:21.891 --> 11:24.758
I don't like this! Why are you birds sucking
around here for? Tell me or get out.

11:24.827 --> 11:28.126
You can't treat us like that, Sam.
It ain't right. We got our work to do.

11:28.197 --> 11:29.755
Why were you tailing Thursby?

11:29.832 --> 11:32.096
I wasn't. Miles was and
for the simple reason we had a client...

11:32.168 --> 11:35.035
- Who's the client?
- Sorry, I can't tell you that.

11:35.104 --> 11:37.504
Be reasonable, Sam.
Give us a break, will you?

11:37.573 --> 11:40.872
How we gonna turn up anything on Miles'
killing if you don't tell us what you got?

11:40.943 --> 11:42.672
Tom says you were in too much of a hurry

11:42.745 --> 11:44.940
to even stop and take a look
at your dead partner.

11:45.014 --> 11:47.482
And you didn't go to Archer's house
to tell his wife.

11:47.550 --> 11:51.179
We called your office and the girl there
said you told her to do it.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.245
I'll give you 10 minutes to get to a phone
and do your talking to the girl.

11:54.323 --> 11:56.723
I'll give you 10 minutes
to get to Thursby's joint,

11:56.792 --> 11:59.192
Geary and Leavenworth.
You could do it easily in that time.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.922
What's your boyfriend getting at, Tom?

12:00.996 --> 12:03.988
Just this, Thursby was shot down
in front of his hotel

12:04.066 --> 12:06.227
about a half an hour
after you left Bush Street.

12:06.302 --> 12:07.564
Keep your paws off me.

12:07.636 --> 12:09.365
What time did you get home?

12:09.438 --> 12:12.236
Just a few minutes ahead of you.
I was walking around thinking things over.

12:12.308 --> 12:14.105
We know you weren't here.
We tried to get you on the phone.

12:14.176 --> 12:15.700
- Where did you walk to?
- Up Bush Street.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.474
- Did you see anybody...
- No. No witnesses.

12:18.748 --> 12:21.046
Well, I know where I stand, now.

12:21.684 --> 12:23.345
Sorry I got up on my hind legs, boys,

12:23.419 --> 12:25.353
but you fellas trying to rope me
made me nervous.

12:25.421 --> 12:28.413
Miles getting bumped off upset me,
and then you birds cracking foxy.

12:28.491 --> 12:30.823
But it's all right now,
now that I know what it's all about.

12:30.893 --> 12:32.224
Forget it, Sam.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.693
- Thursby die?
- Yeah.

12:33.763 --> 12:35.162
How'd I kill him? I forget.

12:35.231 --> 12:39.827
He was shot in the back four times
with a .44 or .45 from across the street.

12:40.236 --> 12:42.261
Nobody saw it, but that's how it figures.

12:42.338 --> 12:43.805
Hotel people know anything about him?

12:43.873 --> 12:45.397
Nothing, except that
he lived there a week.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.964
- Alone?
- Yeah, alone.

12:47.042 --> 12:50.603
Did you find out who he was?
What his game was? Well, did you?

12:50.679 --> 12:54.809
- We thought you could tell us that.
- I've never seen Thursby, dead or alive.

12:54.884 --> 12:56.283
Well, you know me, Spade.

12:56.352 --> 12:57.546
If you did it, or if you didn't,

12:57.620 --> 13:00.418
you'll get a square deal from me
and most of the breaks.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.686
Don't know as I'd blame you much.
The man that killed your partner...

13:03.759 --> 13:06.319
But that won't stop me from nailing you.

13:06.395 --> 13:07.453
Fair enough.

13:07.530 --> 13:10.897
But I'd feel better about it
if you'd have a drink with me.

13:19.008 --> 13:20.339
Success to crime.

13:40.930 --> 13:42.488
She's in there.

13:43.199 --> 13:47.033
- I told you to keep her away from me.
- Yes, but you didn't tell me how.

13:47.269 --> 13:49.760
Don't be cranky with me, Sam.
I've had her all night.

13:49.839 --> 13:51.864
Sorry, angel. I didn't mean...

13:52.641 --> 13:54.006
Hello, Iva.

14:01.484 --> 14:02.610
Sam.

14:05.821 --> 14:07.049
Darling.

14:07.356 --> 14:09.449
Effie take care of everything?

14:09.525 --> 14:10.856
I think so.

14:12.294 --> 14:14.762
Sam, did you kill him?

14:16.932 --> 14:19.457
Who put that bright idea in your head?

14:20.035 --> 14:23.562
Well, I thought you said
if it wasn't for Miles, you'd...

14:24.440 --> 14:26.203
Be kind to me, Sam.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.609
"You killed my husband, Sam.
Be kind to me".

14:48.764 --> 14:50.459
Don't, Iva. Don't.

14:50.799 --> 14:54.326
You shouldn't have come here today,
darling. You ought to be home.

14:54.403 --> 14:55.995
You'll come soon?

14:56.071 --> 14:57.629
Soon as I can.

14:57.973 --> 14:59.531
Goodbye, Iva.

15:20.663 --> 15:21.789
Well,

15:22.331 --> 15:24.561
how did you and the widow make out?

15:24.633 --> 15:26.430
She thinks I shot Miles.

15:26.502 --> 15:29.266
- So you could marry her?
- The cops think I killed Thursby,

15:29.338 --> 15:31.932
the guy Miles was tailing
for that Wonderly dame.

15:32.007 --> 15:33.474
Who do you think I shot?

15:33.542 --> 15:35.009
Are you going to marry Iva?

15:35.077 --> 15:38.012
Don't be silly.
I wish I'd never laid eyes on her.

15:39.081 --> 15:41.675
Do you suppose she could have killed him?

15:42.217 --> 15:45.243
You're an angel.
A nice, rattlebrained, little angel.

15:45.321 --> 15:47.255
- Oh, am I?
- Thanks, honey.

15:47.356 --> 15:50.154
Suppose I told you that your Iva
hadn't been home many minutes

15:50.225 --> 15:53.217
when I arrived to break the news
at 3:00 this morning?

15:53.295 --> 15:54.455
Are you telling me?

15:54.530 --> 15:56.794
She kept me waiting at the door
while she undressed.

15:56.865 --> 15:59.857
Her clothes were on a chair where she'd
dumped them, hat and coat underneath.

15:59.935 --> 16:01.960
Her slip, on top, was still warm.

16:02.037 --> 16:04.597
She'd wrinkled up the bed,
but the wrinkles weren't mashed down.

16:04.673 --> 16:07.540
You're a detective, darling,
but she didn't kill him.

16:07.609 --> 16:10.407
Do the police really think
you shot this what's-his-name?

16:10.479 --> 16:12.879
Do they? Look at me, Sam.

16:13.248 --> 16:14.681
You worry me.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.374
You always think you know
what you're doing,

16:16.452 --> 16:19.012
but you're too slick for your own good.

16:19.622 --> 16:22.648
Someday you're going to find it out.
Spade and Archer.

16:23.092 --> 16:24.719
Yes, Miss Wonderly.

16:26.562 --> 16:27.688
Hello?

16:27.763 --> 16:29.628
Yeah, this is Sam Spade.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.260
Where?

16:32.334 --> 16:36.498
Coronet Apartments, California Avenue,
apartment 1001.

16:36.972 --> 16:39.338
What's the name? Miss LeBlanc.

16:40.209 --> 16:42.200
Okay, I'll be right over.

16:46.482 --> 16:48.916
Have Miles' desk moved out of the office

16:48.984 --> 16:52.545
and have "Spade and Archer" taken off
all the doors and windows

16:52.621 --> 16:54.782
and have "Samuel Spade" put on.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.297
Come in, Mr. Spade.

17:13.474 --> 17:17.502
Everything's upside down.
I haven't finished unpacking. Sit down.

17:24.486 --> 17:25.953
Mr. Spade, I...

17:26.888 --> 17:29.881
I have a terrible,
terrible confession to make.

17:30.993 --> 17:33.120
That story I told you yesterday

17:33.662 --> 17:35.152
was just a story.

17:35.230 --> 17:38.688
Oh, that. Well, we didn't exactly
believe your story, Miss...

17:39.134 --> 17:41.364
What is your name, Wonderly or LeBlanc?

17:41.437 --> 17:43.598
It's really O'Shaughnessy.
Brigid O'Shaughnessy.

17:43.672 --> 17:46.163
We didn't exactly believe your story,
Miss O'Shaughnessy.

17:46.241 --> 17:48.766
- We believed your $200.
- You mean that...

17:48.844 --> 17:51.244
I mean you paid us more
than if you'd been telling us the truth

17:51.313 --> 17:53.543
and enough more to make it all right.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.982
Tell me, Mr. Spade,
am I to blame for last night?

17:57.119 --> 17:59.212
You warned us
that Thursby was dangerous.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.347
Of course, you lied to us
about your sister and all that,

18:01.423 --> 18:03.084
but that didn't count.
We didn't believe you.

18:03.158 --> 18:05.626
No, I wouldn't say that you were at fault.

18:05.694 --> 18:06.922
Thank you.

18:07.396 --> 18:09.591
Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday,

18:09.698 --> 18:12.064
- so solid and hearty, and...
- Stop it.

18:12.167 --> 18:15.261
He knew what he was doing.
Those are the chances we take.

18:15.337 --> 18:16.463
Was he married?

18:16.538 --> 18:20.406
Yeah, with $10,000 insurance, no children
and a wife that didn't like him.

18:20.476 --> 18:22.910
- Please don't.
- That's the way it was.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.970
Anyway, there's no time for worrying
about that now.

18:26.048 --> 18:29.108
Out there's a flock of policemen
and assistant district attorneys

18:29.184 --> 18:32.119
running around with their noses
to the ground.

18:32.955 --> 18:35.446
Mr. Spade, do they know about me?

18:35.524 --> 18:38.254
Not yet. I've been stalling them
until I could see you.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.589
Do they have to know about me? I mean,

18:39.661 --> 18:42.653
can't you shield me so that I won't
have to answer their questions?

18:42.731 --> 18:45.461
Maybe, but I gotta know
what it's all about.

18:46.268 --> 18:47.758
I can't tell you.

18:48.804 --> 18:50.533
I can't tell you now.

18:52.441 --> 18:54.341
I will later, when I can.

18:54.409 --> 18:56.741
You've got to trust me, Mr. Spade.

18:57.379 --> 18:59.711
I'm so alone and afraid.

19:00.582 --> 19:03.676
I've got nobody to help me
if you won't help me.

19:03.986 --> 19:05.613
Be generous, Mr. Spade.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.080
You're brave. You're strong.

19:08.157 --> 19:11.058
You can spare me some of that courage
and strength, surely.

19:11.126 --> 19:13.492
Help me, Mr. Spade. I need help so badly.

19:13.562 --> 19:16.929
I have no right to ask you.
I know I haven't, but I do ask you.

19:16.999 --> 19:18.227
Help me.

19:19.001 --> 19:21.936
You won't need much of anybody's help.
You're good.

19:22.004 --> 19:25.269
It's chiefly your eyes, I think,
and that throb you get in your voice

19:25.340 --> 19:28.434
when you say things like,
"Be generous, Mr. Spade".

19:28.544 --> 19:30.034
I deserve that.

19:30.646 --> 19:35.083
But the lie was in the way I said it,
not at all in what I said.

19:36.785 --> 19:39.652
It's my own fault
if you can't believe me now.

19:41.156 --> 19:43.056
Now you are dangerous.

19:43.692 --> 19:46.456
But I'm afraid I'm not going to be able
to be of much help to you

19:46.528 --> 19:48.428
unless I've got some idea
what it's all about.

19:48.497 --> 19:52.433
For instance, I've gotta have some sort
of a line on your Floyd Thursby.

19:52.935 --> 19:54.425
I met him in the Orient.

19:54.503 --> 19:57.267
We came here from Hong Kong last week.
He promised to help me.

19:57.339 --> 19:59.773
He took advantage of my dependence
on him to betray me.

19:59.841 --> 20:02.867
Betray you? How?
Why did you want him shadowed?

20:03.512 --> 20:07.004
I wanted to find out how far he'd gone,
whom he was meeting, things like that.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.209
- Did he kill Archer?
- Certainly.

20:09.618 --> 20:13.554
He had a Luger in his shoulder holster.
Archer wasn't shot with a Luger.

20:14.790 --> 20:19.124
Mr. Spade, you don't think I had anything
to do with the death of Mr. Archer?

20:19.394 --> 20:20.691
- Did you?
- No.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.024
That's good.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.998
Floyd always carried an extra revolver
in his overcoat pocket.

20:25.067 --> 20:26.796
Why all the guns?

20:26.869 --> 20:28.336
He lived by them.

20:28.403 --> 20:30.803
The story in Hong Kong
is that he first came to the Orient

20:30.872 --> 20:33.705
as bodyguard to a gambler
who'd had to leave the States.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.369
The gambler had since disappeared,
and Floyd knew about the disappearance.

20:36.445 --> 20:37.742
I don't know.

20:37.813 --> 20:41.408
I do know he always went heavily armed,
and that he never went to sleep

20:41.483 --> 20:44.680
without covering the floor around his bed
with crumpled newspapers

20:44.753 --> 20:47.278
so that nobody could come
silently into his room.

20:47.356 --> 20:49.187
You picked a nice sort of a playmate.

20:49.258 --> 20:52.318
Only that sort could have helped me,
if he'd been loyal.

20:52.394 --> 20:55.363
- How bad a spot are you actually in?
- Bad as could be.

20:55.430 --> 20:56.727
Physical danger?

20:56.798 --> 21:00.325
I'm not heroic. I don't think
there's anything worse than death.

21:00.402 --> 21:04.065
- Then it's that?
- It's that, as surely as we're sitting here.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.066
Unless you help me.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.771
Who killed Thursby, your enemies or his?

21:11.380 --> 21:12.745
I don't know.

21:13.081 --> 21:14.571
His, I suppose.

21:14.950 --> 21:17.009
I'm afraid. I don't know.

21:17.085 --> 21:19.610
This is hopeless.
I don't know what you want done.

21:19.688 --> 21:21.349
I don't even know
if you know what you want done.

21:21.423 --> 21:22.515
You won't go to the police?

21:22.591 --> 21:25.458
Go to them? All I got to do is stand still,
and they'll be swarming all over me.

21:25.527 --> 21:28.291
All right, I'll tell them all I know,
and you'll have to take your chances.

21:28.363 --> 21:30.797
You've been patient with me.
You've tried to help me.

21:30.866 --> 21:32.800
It's useless and hopeless, I suppose.

21:32.868 --> 21:36.827
I do thank you for what you've done.
I'll have to take my chances.

21:40.709 --> 21:44.201
- How much money have you got?
- I've got about $500 left.

21:44.279 --> 21:45.678
Give it to me.

22:04.599 --> 22:07.363
- There's only $400 here.
- I had to keep some to live on.

22:07.436 --> 22:08.994
- Well, can't you get some more?
- No.

22:09.071 --> 22:11.130
Haven't you got anything
you can raise some money on?

22:11.206 --> 22:14.869
- I've got some furs and a little jewelry.
- You'll have to hock them.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.278
There you are.

22:23.352 --> 22:25.946
I'll be back as soon as I can
with the best news I can manage.

22:26.021 --> 22:28.353
I'll ring four times, long, short, long, short.

22:28.423 --> 22:32.154
And no, you needn't bother
to come to the door. I'll let myself in.

22:40.969 --> 22:42.402
Anything stirring?

22:42.471 --> 22:43.938
Did you send the flowers?

22:44.005 --> 22:47.907
You're invaluable, darling. Say,
get my lawyer on the phone, will you?

23:03.358 --> 23:04.689
Hello, Sid?

23:05.227 --> 23:08.993
I think I'm going to have to tell a coroner
to go to blazes, Sid.

23:09.765 --> 23:12.563
Hey, can I hide behind the sanctity
of my client's identity,

23:12.634 --> 23:15.933
secrets and what-nots
all the same, priest or lawyer?

23:16.271 --> 23:18.296
Yeah, I know, but Dundy's
getting a little rambunctious,

23:18.373 --> 23:20.398
and maybe it is a bit thick this time.

23:20.475 --> 23:23.171
Yeah. What'll it cost
to be on the safe side?

23:23.378 --> 23:25.972
Well, maybe it's worth it. Okay, go ahead.

23:32.554 --> 23:33.714
Gardenia.

23:33.789 --> 23:35.620
Quick, darling, in with him.

23:38.727 --> 23:40.752
Will you come in, Mr. Cairo?

23:46.501 --> 23:48.401
Will you sit down, Mr. Cairo?

23:48.670 --> 23:50.194
Thank you, sir.

23:52.974 --> 23:55.568
Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Cairo?

23:55.644 --> 23:59.876
May a stranger offer condolences
for your partner's unfortunate death?

24:00.348 --> 24:01.406
Thanks.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.610
Is there, Mr. Spade,
as the newspapers imply,

24:03.685 --> 24:07.553
a certain relationship
between that unfortunate happening

24:07.622 --> 24:10.716
and the death a little later
of the man Thursby?

24:13.028 --> 24:14.893
I beg your pardon. No.

24:15.363 --> 24:18.093
More than idle curiosity prompted
my question.

24:18.567 --> 24:21.058
See, Mr. Spade, I'm trying to recover

24:21.870 --> 24:24.998
an ornament that, shall we say,
has been mislaid.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.236
I thought and hoped you could assist me.

24:28.310 --> 24:30.244
The ornament is a statuette,

24:31.179 --> 24:33.204
a black figure of a bird.

24:33.281 --> 24:35.249
I am prepared to pay, on behalf

24:35.317 --> 24:39.378
of the figure's rightful owner,
the sum of $5,000 for its recovery.

24:40.121 --> 24:43.386
I am prepared to promise that,
what is the phrase?

24:44.226 --> 24:46.057
No questions will be asked.

24:46.128 --> 24:48.255
$5,000 is a lot of money.

24:52.167 --> 24:53.532
Yes, Effie?

24:54.136 --> 24:57.731
No, that'll be all. Just be sure to lock
the door behind you on your way out.

24:57.806 --> 24:59.034
Good night.

25:00.175 --> 25:01.175
$5,000 is...

25:01.243 --> 25:04.872
You will clasp your hands together
at the back of your neck.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.844
I intend to search your offices, Mr. Spade.

25:08.450 --> 25:12.318
I warn you, if you attempt to prevent me,
I shall certainly shoot you.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.521
Go ahead and search.

25:14.589 --> 25:17.422
Will you please come
to the center of the room?

25:19.828 --> 25:22.695
I have to make certain
that you are not armed.

25:55.530 --> 25:56.827
PASSPORT
Joel Cairo

25:56.898 --> 25:58.422
FRENCH REPUBLIC
PASSPORT

26:49.184 --> 26:51.015
Look what you did to my shirt.

26:51.086 --> 26:52.246
Sorry.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.483
But imagine my embarrassment
when I found out that $5,000 offer

26:55.557 --> 26:56.649
was just hooey.

26:56.725 --> 26:58.989
Mr. Spade, my offer is genuine.

26:59.361 --> 27:02.819
I am prepared to pay $5,000
for the figure's return.

27:04.065 --> 27:05.657
- Do you have it?
- No.

27:06.868 --> 27:08.165
But if it isn't here,

27:08.236 --> 27:11.296
why did you risk serious injury
to prevent my searching for it?

27:11.373 --> 27:14.467
Why should I sit around here
and let people come in and stick me up?

27:14.542 --> 27:17.807
But certainly it is only natural
that I try to save the owner

27:17.879 --> 27:20.040
such a considerable expense, if possible.

27:20.115 --> 27:21.309
Who is he?

27:21.383 --> 27:24.910
Mr. Spade, you'll forgive
my not answering that question.

27:24.986 --> 27:27.147
Yeah, well, I think
we'd be better off all around

27:27.222 --> 27:28.655
if we'd put our cards on the table.

27:28.723 --> 27:31.283
No, I do not think it would be better.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.456
You see, Mr. Spade,
if you know more than I do,

27:34.529 --> 27:36.588
then I shall profit by your knowledge.

27:36.665 --> 27:39.566
So will you, to the extent of $5,000.

27:39.634 --> 27:41.932
There's nothing like $5,000 here.

27:42.003 --> 27:44.836
You want some assurance of my sincerity?

27:45.006 --> 27:47.236
- A retainer? Would that do?
- It might.

27:47.309 --> 27:49.300
You will take, say, $100?

27:49.511 --> 27:51.706
No. I will take, say, $200.

27:52.313 --> 27:54.838
Now, let's see, your first guess
was that I had the bird.

27:54.916 --> 27:55.940
There's nothing to that.

27:56.017 --> 27:57.484
What's your second guess?

27:57.552 --> 28:01.613
That you know where it is, or at least
you know it is where you can get it.

28:01.690 --> 28:04.215
You're not hiring me to do any murders
or burglaries,

28:04.292 --> 28:07.625
but simply to get it back if possible,
in an honest, lawful way?

28:07.696 --> 28:08.924
If possible.

28:08.997 --> 28:12.125
But in any case, with discretion.

28:14.035 --> 28:17.971
When you wish to contact me, sir,
I'm staying at the Hotel Belvedere,

28:18.039 --> 28:20.303
room 635.

28:21.276 --> 28:24.302
I sincerely expect
the greatest mutual benefit

28:24.546 --> 28:26.912
from our association, Mr. Spade.

28:27.782 --> 28:29.613
May I please have my gun, now?

28:29.684 --> 28:32.152
Oh, sure. I'd forgotten all about it.

28:34.255 --> 28:37.452
Will you please clasp your hands together
at the back of your neck?

28:37.525 --> 28:39.686
I intend to search your offices.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.126
Well, I'll be...

28:44.499 --> 28:45.830
Why, sure.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.668
Go ahead. I won't stop you.

29:35.316 --> 29:38.479
- Turn to the right and go up the hill, driver.
- Okay.

30:18.526 --> 30:19.823
Mr. Spade.

30:21.396 --> 30:23.125
Do you bring any news?

30:23.264 --> 30:26.324
I mean, did you manage it so that
the police won't have to know about me?

30:26.401 --> 30:28.130
Well, they won't for a while, anyway.

30:28.203 --> 30:29.795
You are wonderful.

30:30.472 --> 30:32.030
You won't get into any trouble, will you?

30:32.106 --> 30:34.836
I don't mind a reasonable amount
of trouble.

30:37.111 --> 30:38.578
Do sit down.

30:51.192 --> 30:54.855
You aren't exactly the sort of a person
you pretend to be, are you?

30:55.730 --> 30:58.665
Why, I'm not sure I know exactly
what you mean.

30:58.766 --> 31:02.463
The schoolgirl manner. You know,
blushing, stammering and all that.

31:05.106 --> 31:07.904
I haven't lived a good life. I've been bad.

31:09.444 --> 31:10.934
Worse than you could know.

31:11.012 --> 31:13.242
Yeah, well, that's good,
because if you actually were

31:13.314 --> 31:16.112
as innocent as you pretend to be,
we'd never get anywhere.

31:16.184 --> 31:17.515
I won't be innocent.

31:17.585 --> 31:18.711
Good.

31:20.255 --> 31:22.723
By the way, I saw Joel Cairo tonight.

31:24.225 --> 31:26.659
- Do you know him?
- Only slightly.

31:51.853 --> 31:54.083
You're good. You're very good.

31:54.255 --> 31:55.813
- What did he say?
- About what?

31:55.890 --> 31:57.619
- About me.
- Nothing.

31:58.026 --> 32:02.053
- What did you talk about then?
- He offered me $5,000 for the black bird.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.832
You're not going to go around the room
straightening things

32:07.902 --> 32:10.029
and poking the fire again, are you?

32:10.104 --> 32:11.435
No, I'm not.

32:12.206 --> 32:15.573
- What did you say?
- I said $5,000 was a lot of money.

32:15.643 --> 32:16.803
It is.

32:17.278 --> 32:21.112
It's more than I can ever offer you
if I have to bid for your loyalty.

32:23.084 --> 32:25.211
That's good coming from you.

32:25.853 --> 32:28.378
What have you ever given me
beside money?

32:28.456 --> 32:31.516
You ever given me any of your confidence,
any of the truth?

32:31.592 --> 32:34.083
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty
with money and nothing else?

32:34.162 --> 32:36.596
What else is there I can buy you with?

32:53.181 --> 32:55.672
I don't care what your secrets are,

32:56.284 --> 32:59.947
but I can't go ahead without
more confidence in you than I've got now.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.955
You've got to convince me
that you know what this is all about,

33:02.023 --> 33:05.322
that you aren't just fiddling around,
hoping it'll all come out right in the end.

33:05.393 --> 33:06.587
Can't you trust me a little longer?

33:06.661 --> 33:08.993
How much is a little?
What are you waiting for?

33:09.063 --> 33:10.724
I've got to talk to Joel Cairo.

33:10.798 --> 33:14.165
You can see him tonight.
He's at the theater. It'll be out soon.

33:14.235 --> 33:17.261
- I'll leave a message at his hotel.
- He can't come here.

33:17.338 --> 33:19.431
I can't let him know where I am. I'm afraid.

33:19.507 --> 33:20.997
My place, then.

33:21.976 --> 33:23.102
Hello?

33:23.177 --> 33:25.645
- I want to leave a message for Joel Cairo.
- All right.

33:48.102 --> 33:50.502
You know, I never would've placed myself
in this position

33:50.571 --> 33:52.436
if I didn't trust you completely.

33:52.507 --> 33:53.872
That again?

33:56.978 --> 33:58.878
Do you know that's true, though?

33:59.347 --> 34:03.477
You don't have to trust me, so long
as you can persuade me to trust you.

34:04.552 --> 34:06.747
But don't worry about that now.

34:06.821 --> 34:08.721
He'll be along any minute.

34:09.157 --> 34:12.717
You get your business with Cairo
over with, then we'll see how we stand.

34:12.793 --> 34:15.922
And you'll let me go about it with him
in my own way?

34:15.996 --> 34:17.190
Sure.

34:19.967 --> 34:21.628
You are a godsend.

34:22.402 --> 34:24.393
Well, now don't overdo it.

34:32.447 --> 34:36.281
Mr. Spade, there is a boy outside.
He seems to be watching the house.

34:36.350 --> 34:37.681
Yeah, I know. I spotted him.

34:37.752 --> 34:39.743
What? What's that? What boy?

34:39.821 --> 34:42.380
I don't know. A kid.
He's been trailing me all evening.

34:42.456 --> 34:45.551
- Did he follow you to my apartment?
- No. I shook him long before that.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.355
Come in, Mr. Cairo.

34:52.132 --> 34:56.228
- I'm delighted to see you again, madam.
- I was sure you would be, Joel.

35:00.408 --> 35:03.434
Mr. Spade told me about your offer
for the Falcon.

35:03.511 --> 35:05.775
- How soon can you have the money ready?
- The money is ready.

35:05.847 --> 35:07.109
- In cash?
- Yes.

35:07.181 --> 35:10.150
You're ready to pay $5,000
if we turn over the Falcon to you?

35:10.218 --> 35:13.119
Excuse me, please.
I must have expressed myself badly.

35:13.187 --> 35:15.781
I did not mean to say
that I have the money in my pocket,

35:15.857 --> 35:18.883
but that I am ready to get it for you
on a few minutes' notice,

35:18.960 --> 35:20.723
anytime during banking hours.

35:20.795 --> 35:23.423
That's probably true.
He only had a couple of hundred on him

35:23.498 --> 35:26.058
when I searched him late this afternoon
at my office.

35:26.134 --> 35:30.833
I shall be able to have the money for you
at, say, 10:30 in the morning.

35:31.973 --> 35:33.998
But I haven't got the Falcon.

35:35.576 --> 35:38.374
I'll have it in another week
at the most, though.

35:38.479 --> 35:40.037
Then where is it?

35:40.148 --> 35:43.083
- Where Floyd hid it.
- Floyd hid...

35:43.484 --> 35:46.544
And you know where he hid it?
Then why do we have to wait a week?

35:46.621 --> 35:48.111
Perhaps not a whole week.

35:48.189 --> 35:52.182
And why, if I may ask another question,
are you willing to sell it to me?

35:52.960 --> 35:54.723
Because I'm afraid.

35:55.163 --> 35:57.222
After what happened to Floyd,
I'm afraid to touch it,

35:57.298 --> 35:58.822
except to turn it over to somebody else.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.095
What exactly did happen to Floyd?

36:03.671 --> 36:05.002
The fat man.

36:05.439 --> 36:06.770
Fat man.

36:07.308 --> 36:10.038
- Is he here?
- I don't know. I suppose so.

36:10.344 --> 36:11.936
What difference does it make?

36:12.013 --> 36:14.174
It might make a world of difference.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.444
Or you or me.

36:16.517 --> 36:19.611
Precisely. But, shall we add,
more certainly

36:20.922 --> 36:22.219
the boy outside?

36:22.290 --> 36:25.726
Yes. But you might be able
to get around him, Joel,

36:25.793 --> 36:27.727
as you did the one in Istanbul.

36:27.795 --> 36:29.456
What was his name?

36:29.797 --> 36:32.493
You mean the one you couldn't get
to come to...

36:36.837 --> 36:40.102
This is the second time
that you have laid hands on me.

36:40.174 --> 36:42.870
When you're slapped,
you'll take it and like it.

36:45.346 --> 36:46.711
Who's that?

36:46.881 --> 36:48.746
I don't know. Keep quiet.

36:56.691 --> 36:57.885
Hello.

36:58.559 --> 37:01.119
You guys pick swell hours
to do your visiting in.

37:01.195 --> 37:03.459
- What is it this time?
- We want to talk to you, Spade.

37:03.531 --> 37:04.691
Well, go ahead and talk.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.392
We don't have to do it out here in the hall,
do we, Sam?

37:06.467 --> 37:09.527
- You can't come in.
- Come off it now, Sam.

37:09.904 --> 37:12.065
You aren't trying to strong-arm me,
are you, Tom?

37:12.139 --> 37:13.629
Why don't you be reasonable?

37:13.708 --> 37:15.801
It would pay you
to play along with us a little, Spade.

37:15.877 --> 37:17.435
You got away with this,
and you got away with that,

37:17.511 --> 37:19.138
but you can't keep it up forever.

37:19.213 --> 37:22.114
- Stop me when you can.
- That's what I intend to do.

37:22.183 --> 37:24.549
There's talk going around
about you and Archer's wife.

37:24.619 --> 37:26.780
- Is there anything to it?
- Not a thing.

37:26.854 --> 37:28.822
The talk is that she tried
to get a divorce from him

37:28.889 --> 37:31.084
so she could put in with you,
and he wouldn't give it to her.

37:31.158 --> 37:32.523
- Anything to that?
- No.

37:32.593 --> 37:34.652
There's even talk that
that's why he was put on the spot.

37:34.729 --> 37:36.356
Don't be a hog, Dundy.

37:36.430 --> 37:39.160
Your first idea that I killed Thursby
because he killed Miles

37:39.233 --> 37:41.599
falls to pieces if you blame me
for killing Miles, too.

37:41.669 --> 37:43.728
You haven't heard me say
you killed anybody.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.169
You're the one that keeps bringing that up.

37:45.239 --> 37:47.901
Haven't you anything better to do
than to keep popping in here

37:47.975 --> 37:50.375
early every morning,
asking a lot of fool questions?

37:50.444 --> 37:53.470
- And getting a lot of lying answers.
- Take it easy.

37:53.547 --> 37:55.538
If you say there's nothing
between you and Archer's wife,

37:55.616 --> 37:57.345
you're a liar and I'm telling you so.

37:57.418 --> 38:01.013
Is that the hot tip that brought you
up here at this ungodly hour of the night?

38:01.088 --> 38:02.316
That's one of them.

38:02.390 --> 38:03.823
And the other?

38:04.325 --> 38:05.553
Let us in.

38:07.461 --> 38:09.429
All right, Spade, we'll go.

38:10.031 --> 38:12.761
Maybe you're right in bucking us.
Think it over.

38:15.536 --> 38:16.628
Help!

38:17.071 --> 38:19.801
- I guess we're going in.
- I guess you are.

38:22.543 --> 38:24.010
What's going on in here?

38:24.078 --> 38:26.546
Look, Officer! Look what she did!

38:27.415 --> 38:29.315
- Did you do that?
- I had to.

38:29.417 --> 38:31.442
I was alone in here with him.
He tried to attack me.

38:31.519 --> 38:33.510
I had to keep him off.
I couldn't bring myself to shoot him.

38:33.587 --> 38:36.579
You dirty, filthy liar! You... It isn't true!

38:36.657 --> 38:39.626
I came up here in good faith,
and then both of them attacked me.

38:39.694 --> 38:43.221
And then when he went out to talk to you,
he left her here with a pistol.

38:43.297 --> 38:45.663
And she said as soon as you leave,
they are going to kill me,

38:45.733 --> 38:49.100
so I called for help because I didn't want
you to leave me and be murdered.

38:49.170 --> 38:51.365
And then she struck me with a pistol!

38:51.439 --> 38:53.737
Why don't you make him tell the truth?

38:54.575 --> 38:55.803
Behave yourself, sister.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.309
That's no way to act.

38:57.378 --> 39:00.040
Well, Tom, I don't guess we'll be wrong
running the lot of them in.

39:00.114 --> 39:02.639
Don't be in a hurry, boys.
Everything can be explained.

39:02.717 --> 39:03.843
I'll bet.

39:03.918 --> 39:05.283
Miss O'Shaughnessy, may I present

39:05.353 --> 39:07.844
Lieutenant Dundy
and Detective Sergeant Polhaus?

39:07.922 --> 39:11.722
Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative
in my employ since yesterday.

39:11.792 --> 39:12.918
That's a lie, too.

39:12.993 --> 39:14.620
That is Mr. Joel Cairo.

39:14.996 --> 39:18.932
Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby's.
He came into my office late this afternoon

39:19.000 --> 39:20.695
and hired me to find something
that Thursby

39:20.768 --> 39:22.998
was supposed to have on him
when he was bumped off.

39:23.070 --> 39:26.403
It looked funny to me the way he put it,
so I wouldn't touch it.

39:26.474 --> 39:29.500
Then he pulled a gun on me.
Well, that's neither here nor there,

39:29.577 --> 39:32.740
unless we start preferring charges
against each other.

39:33.881 --> 39:36.008
Anyway, Miss O'Shaughnessy
and I discussed the matter,

39:36.083 --> 39:38.574
and we decided to find out
exactly how much he knew

39:38.652 --> 39:40.483
about Miles' and Thursby's killings,

39:40.554 --> 39:42.488
so we asked him to come up here.

39:42.556 --> 39:45.992
Now, maybe we did put the questions
to him a little roughly.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.260
You know how that is, Lieutenant.

39:48.329 --> 39:51.162
But we didn't hurt him enough
to make him cry for help.

39:51.232 --> 39:54.224
- Well, what have you got to say to that?
- I don't know what to say.

39:54.301 --> 39:55.700
Try telling the facts.

39:55.770 --> 39:57.738
- What? Facts?
- Quit stalling.

39:57.805 --> 40:00.569
All you have to do is swear out
a complaint they took a poke at you,

40:00.641 --> 40:01.972
and I'll throw them in the can.

40:02.043 --> 40:04.034
Go ahead, Cairo. Tell him, he'll do it.

40:04.111 --> 40:07.979
Then we'll swear out a complaint
against you, and he'll have the lot of us.

40:08.049 --> 40:09.573
Get your hats.

40:09.850 --> 40:13.013
Well, boys and girls, we put it over nicely.

40:13.087 --> 40:14.349
Go on, get your hats.

40:14.422 --> 40:16.219
Don't you know when you're being kidded?

40:16.290 --> 40:18.656
No, but that can wait
till we get down to the hall.

40:18.726 --> 40:21.194
Wake up, Dundy, you're being kidded.

40:21.295 --> 40:24.128
When I heard the buzzer, I said
to Miss O'Shaughnessy and Cairo here,

40:24.198 --> 40:27.326
I said, "There's the police again.
They're getting to be a nuisance.

40:27.401 --> 40:28.891
"When you hear them going,
one of you scream,

40:28.969 --> 40:31.961
"and then we'll see how far along
we can string them until they tumble".

40:32.039 --> 40:33.529
Stop it, Sam!

40:33.607 --> 40:35.734
That cut on his head.
How did that get there?

40:35.810 --> 40:38.870
- Ask him. Maybe he cut himself shaving.
- The cut? No.

40:38.946 --> 40:43.280
When we pretended to be struggling
for the gun, I fell over the carpet. I fell.

40:43.417 --> 40:44.645
Horsefeathers.

40:44.718 --> 40:46.447
Take him along, anyway,
for packing a gun.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.010
Don't be a sap.

40:48.222 --> 40:50.053
That gun was a plant. It was one of mine.

40:50.124 --> 40:53.116
It's too bad it was only a .25, or maybe
you could prove that was the gun

40:53.194 --> 40:55.662
that Miles and Thursby were shot with.

40:56.797 --> 40:58.856
- No, Sam! No!
- Well, then get him out of here.

40:58.933 --> 41:02.869
- Get their names and addresses.
- My name is Joel Cairo, Hotel Belvedere.

41:02.970 --> 41:04.665
Miss O'Shaughnessy's address
is my office.

41:04.738 --> 41:06.706
- Where do you live?
- Get him out of here! I've had enough...

41:06.774 --> 41:09.334
Now, now. Take it easy, will you, Sam?
Is that all you want, Lieutenant?

41:09.410 --> 41:10.877
- Yeah.
- I think I'll be going now.

41:10.945 --> 41:12.344
What's the hurry, Cairo?

41:12.413 --> 41:15.507
There is no hurry.
It's getting quite late, and...

41:17.051 --> 41:18.985
Tell him to leave the gun.

41:22.389 --> 41:25.085
I hope you know what you're doing, Sam.

41:35.002 --> 41:38.995
You're absolutely the wildest, most
unpredictable person I've ever known.

41:39.206 --> 41:41.674
Do you always carry on so highhanded?

41:43.577 --> 41:45.875
Well, you've had your talk with Cairo.

41:46.313 --> 41:48.008
Now you can talk to me.

41:48.749 --> 41:50.273
Yes, of course.

41:50.518 --> 41:52.042
I'm listening.

41:53.387 --> 41:54.877
I'm still listening.

41:54.955 --> 41:59.289
- Look at the time. I must be going.
- No. Not till you've told me all about it.

41:59.460 --> 42:00.984
Am I a prisoner?

42:01.428 --> 42:03.919
Maybe the boy outside
hasn't gone home yet.

42:05.699 --> 42:07.633
Do you suppose he's still there?

42:07.701 --> 42:08.929
Likely.

42:10.037 --> 42:11.527
You can start now.

42:16.243 --> 42:18.677
You are the most insistent person.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.305
And wild and unpredictable, huh?

42:22.149 --> 42:25.983
Say, what's this bird, this Falcon
that everybody's all steamed up about?

42:26.053 --> 42:28.544
Supposing I wouldn't tell you
anything about it at all?

42:28.622 --> 42:31.750
What would you do?
Something wild and unpredictable?

42:32.226 --> 42:33.352
I might.

42:35.763 --> 42:38.323
It's a black figure, as you know,
smooth and shiny,

42:38.399 --> 42:41.129
of a bird, a hawk or falcon,
about that high.

42:41.435 --> 42:42.493
Here.

42:44.905 --> 42:48.534
- What makes it so important?
- I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.

42:48.609 --> 42:52.545
They offered me Â£500 if I'd help them
get it away from the man who had it.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.137
That was in Istanbul?

42:54.214 --> 42:55.442
Marmara.

42:56.183 --> 42:57.343
Go ahead.

42:57.618 --> 42:58.915
But that's all.

42:59.687 --> 43:02.815
They promised me Â£500 if I'd help them,
and I did.

43:03.591 --> 43:06.617
Then we found out that Joel Cairo
intended to desert us,

43:06.694 --> 43:09.822
taking the Falcon with him
and leaving Floyd and me nothing.

43:09.897 --> 43:11.990
So we did exactly that to him.

43:12.499 --> 43:14.763
Then I wasn't any better off
than I was before,

43:14.835 --> 43:17.235
because Floyd hadn't any intention
of keeping his promise to me

43:17.304 --> 43:20.432
about sharing equally.
I'd learned that by the time we got here.

43:20.507 --> 43:22.236
What's the bird made of?

43:22.309 --> 43:26.040
Porcelain or black stone. I don't know.
I only saw it once for a few minutes.

43:26.113 --> 43:28.843
Floyd showed it to me
when we first got hold of it.

43:28.916 --> 43:30.406
You are a liar.

43:33.621 --> 43:34.713
I am.

43:35.656 --> 43:37.351
I've always been a liar.

43:38.158 --> 43:40.285
Don't brag about it.

43:40.995 --> 43:43.361
Was there any truth at all in that yarn?

43:43.764 --> 43:44.924
Some.

43:45.599 --> 43:47.066
Not very much.

43:48.268 --> 43:50.759
Well, we got all night.

43:51.505 --> 43:54.599
Coffee'll be ready soon.
We'll have a cup and try again.

43:54.675 --> 43:56.472
I'm so tired.

43:58.045 --> 44:01.037
So tired of lying and making up lies.

44:01.515 --> 44:05.042
Not knowing what is a lie
and what's the truth. I wish...

44:27.941 --> 44:30.432
I want to talk to Mr. Cairo, Joel Cairo.

44:35.315 --> 44:36.441
Thanks.

44:48.195 --> 44:49.457
Where is he?

44:50.831 --> 44:52.992
- What?
- Where is he?

44:53.133 --> 44:55.067
- Who?
- Cairo.

44:55.469 --> 44:57.630
What do you think you're doing, Jack,
kidding me?

44:57.705 --> 44:59.400
I'll tell you when I am.

44:59.673 --> 45:01.265
New York, aren't you?

45:01.342 --> 45:02.570
Shove off.

45:02.843 --> 45:05.175
You're gonna have to talk to me
before you're through, sonny.

45:05.245 --> 45:08.510
Some of you will,
and you can tell the fat man I said so.

45:09.750 --> 45:12.878
Keep asking for it
and you're gonna get it, plenty.

45:13.687 --> 45:15.382
I told you to shove off.

45:15.789 --> 45:16.983
Shove off.

45:18.425 --> 45:20.655
People lose teeth talking like that.

45:20.728 --> 45:23.322
You want to hang around, you'll be polite.

45:28.936 --> 45:29.994
Luke.

45:35.843 --> 45:37.743
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Luke.

45:37.811 --> 45:40.245
Say, that was too bad about Miles.

45:40.414 --> 45:42.245
Yeah. It was a tough break.

45:42.316 --> 45:44.216
I want to show you something.

45:47.287 --> 45:49.949
What do you let these cheap gunmen
hang around the lobby for,

45:50.023 --> 45:52.719
with their heaters bulging in their clothes?

45:55.496 --> 45:57.088
What do you want here?

46:00.801 --> 46:02.769
Well, if you don't want anything, beat it

46:02.836 --> 46:04.463
and don't come back.

46:06.874 --> 46:08.569
I won't forget you guys.

46:18.385 --> 46:21.479
- What is it?
- I don't know. I just spotted him.

46:22.422 --> 46:25.619
- Say, what about Miles?
- I'll see you, Luke.

46:26.560 --> 46:27.993
- 603.
- Yes, sir.

46:30.264 --> 46:31.492
Good morning.

46:31.698 --> 46:32.892
- Good morning.
- There you are, sir.

46:32.966 --> 46:34.627
Let's go someplace where we can talk.

46:34.701 --> 46:36.965
No. Our private conversations
have not been such

46:37.037 --> 46:38.595
that I'm anxious to continue them.

46:38.672 --> 46:41.140
Forgive my speaking so bluntly,
but it is the truth.

46:41.208 --> 46:42.641
You mean last night?
What else could I do?

46:42.709 --> 46:44.609
I had to throw in with her.
I don't know where the bird is,

46:44.678 --> 46:46.236
and neither do you. She does.

46:46.346 --> 46:47.973
How're we gonna get it
if I don't play along with her?

46:48.048 --> 46:50.710
You always have a very smooth
explanation ready, huh?

46:50.784 --> 46:52.752
What do you want me to do?
Learn to stutter?

46:52.820 --> 46:55.482
Dundy take you down to the station?
How long did they work on you?

46:55.556 --> 46:57.285
Till a little while ago.

46:57.357 --> 47:00.724
- What'd they shake out of you?
- Shake out? Not one thing.

47:00.794 --> 47:03.854
I adhered to the course you indicated
earlier in your rooms,

47:03.931 --> 47:07.367
but I certainly wish you would have
invented a more reasonable story.

47:07.434 --> 47:09.698
I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it.

47:09.770 --> 47:12.000
Don't worry about the story's goofiness.

47:12.072 --> 47:14.734
A sensible one would have
had us all in the cooler.

47:14.808 --> 47:17.368
- You sure you didn't tell them anything?
- I did not.

47:17.444 --> 47:18.604
Now, you'll want sleep

47:18.679 --> 47:21.409
if you've been standing up
under a police grilling all night.

47:21.482 --> 47:23.507
- See you later.
- No, not yet.

47:27.054 --> 47:29.887
Yes, I'll have him call you
the minute he comes in.

47:29.957 --> 47:32.517
That's the third time she's called
this morning.

47:32.593 --> 47:34.993
- Miss O'Shaughnessy's in there.
- Anything else?

47:35.062 --> 47:38.725
The district attorney's office called.
Bryan would like to see you.

47:38.799 --> 47:40.596
And a Mr. Gutman called.

47:40.667 --> 47:43.261
And when I told him you weren't in,
he said, "Would you please tell him that

47:43.337 --> 47:47.501
"the young man gave me his message,
and that I phoned and will phone again?"

47:48.208 --> 47:49.402
Gutman, huh?

47:50.677 --> 47:52.042
Thanks, darling.

47:53.981 --> 47:56.415
Darling. Somebody's been
in my apartment.

47:56.483 --> 47:58.280
It's all upside down, every which way.

47:58.352 --> 48:00.616
I changed as fast as I could
and came right over here.

48:00.687 --> 48:02.416
You must have let that boy
follow you there.

48:02.489 --> 48:06.323
No, angel. I shook him off
long before I ever went to your place.

48:06.426 --> 48:09.452
It might have been Cairo.
He wasn't at the hotel last night.

48:09.529 --> 48:12.760
He told me he'd been standing up
under a police grilling. I wonder.

48:12.833 --> 48:14.733
- You saw Joel this morning?
- Yeah.

48:14.801 --> 48:15.927
Why?

48:16.003 --> 48:18.301
Because, my own true love,
I've got to keep in some sort of touch

48:18.372 --> 48:22.832
with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair
if I'm ever gonna make heads or tails of it.

48:22.910 --> 48:25.140
Now we've got to find
a new home for you.

48:25.212 --> 48:27.077
I won't go back there.

48:28.849 --> 48:30.874
I got an idea. Wait a minute.

48:33.754 --> 48:35.915
What does your woman's intuition
tell you about her?

48:35.989 --> 48:39.015
She's all right. Maybe it's her own fault
for being in whatever the trouble is,

48:39.092 --> 48:41.750
but she's all right, if that's what you mean.
- That's what I mean.

48:41.828 --> 48:43.887
Are you strong enough for her
to put her up for a few days?

48:43.964 --> 48:45.659
- You mean at home?
- Yeah.

48:45.799 --> 48:48.529
- Is she in any danger, Sam?
- I think she is.

48:48.869 --> 48:51.201
Gee, that'd scare Mom
into a green hemorrhage.

48:51.271 --> 48:53.398
I'd have to say
she's a surprise witness or something

48:53.473 --> 48:54.804
you're keeping undercover
until the last minute.

48:54.875 --> 48:56.240
You're a darling.

48:57.077 --> 48:58.271
Brigid.

48:59.079 --> 49:01.104
Effie here has offered to put you up
for a few days.

49:01.181 --> 49:02.409
That's very kind of you.

49:02.482 --> 49:04.609
You'd better start now.
Go out the back entrance.

49:04.685 --> 49:06.676
There's usually a cab parked there
by the alleyway.

49:06.753 --> 49:09.449
You ride partway with her over the bridge
and make sure you're not followed.

49:09.523 --> 49:11.787
You better change cabs a couple of times,
just to be on the safe side.

49:11.858 --> 49:12.950
I'll give Mom a ring.

49:13.026 --> 49:15.722
There's time enough for that
when you get back.

49:16.029 --> 49:17.519
I'll call you later.

49:38.251 --> 49:39.275
Hello?

49:39.586 --> 49:41.144
This is Samuel Spade.

49:41.254 --> 49:44.223
Say, my secretary tells me
Mr. Bryan wants to see me.

49:45.592 --> 49:48.425
Yeah. Ask him what time's
most convenient for him.

49:48.996 --> 49:51.692
Spade. S-P-A-D-E.

49:52.165 --> 49:53.496
Hello, honey.

49:53.700 --> 49:54.792
Yeah.

49:55.035 --> 49:57.060
2:30. All right. Thanks.

49:57.638 --> 50:00.163
Sam, forgive me. Please forgive me.

50:00.841 --> 50:03.105
I sent those policemen
to your place last night.

50:03.176 --> 50:06.339
I was mad, crazy with jealousy.
I phoned that if they went there,

50:06.413 --> 50:08.506
they'd learn something
about Miles' murder.

50:08.582 --> 50:11.881
- What made you think of that?
- I was mad, Sam. I wanted to hurt you.

50:11.952 --> 50:13.419
Did you tell them who you were
when you phoned?

50:13.487 --> 50:15.785
- No. Sam, dearest, I...
- Where'd you phone from?

50:15.856 --> 50:17.619
The drugstore across from your place.

50:17.691 --> 50:20.251
You better hurry along home
and think of something to tell the police.

50:20.327 --> 50:22.659
You'll be hearing from them,
and by the way,

50:22.729 --> 50:25.425
where were you the night
Miles was murdered?

50:25.899 --> 50:27.025
Home.

50:27.668 --> 50:28.930
- I was.
- No.

50:29.002 --> 50:31.835
But if that's your story,
it's all right with me.

50:32.606 --> 50:34.267
Now you run along.

50:44.751 --> 50:45.809
Hello?

50:45.886 --> 50:47.683
Yeah, this is Spade.

50:47.754 --> 50:50.655
Yes, Mr. Gutman, I got it.
Yeah, I've been waiting to hear from you.

50:50.724 --> 50:54.285
Well, now. The sooner, the better.
Say, 15 minutes? Right.

50:54.561 --> 50:55.653
12C.

50:56.897 --> 50:58.524
12C to your left, sir.

51:18.018 --> 51:20.987
- Mr. Spade.
- How do you do, Mr. Gutman?

51:37.304 --> 51:38.498
You begin well, sir.

51:38.572 --> 51:40.802
I distrust a man who says "when".

51:40.874 --> 51:43.206
He's got to be careful
not to drink too much,

51:43.276 --> 51:45.574
because he's not to be trusted
when he does.

51:45.645 --> 51:46.805
Well, sir,

51:48.381 --> 51:51.316
here's to plain speaking
and clear understanding.

51:59.926 --> 52:02.724
- You're a close-mouthed man?
- No, I like to talk.

52:02.796 --> 52:05.959
Better and better.
I distrust a close-mouthed man.

52:06.466 --> 52:10.027
He generally picks the wrong time to talk
and says the wrong things.

52:10.103 --> 52:14.233
Talking's something you can't do
judiciously unless you keep in practice.

52:15.942 --> 52:18.069
Now, sir. We'll talk, if you like.

52:18.245 --> 52:22.443
I'll tell you right out. I'm a man who likes
talking to a man who likes to talk.

52:22.516 --> 52:23.574
Swell.

52:23.650 --> 52:26.016
Will we talk about the black bird?

52:26.720 --> 52:28.278
You're a man for me, sir.

52:28.355 --> 52:30.983
No beating about the bush.
Right to the point.

52:31.091 --> 52:33.355
Let's talk about the black bird,
by all means.

52:33.426 --> 52:34.984
But first, sir, answer me a question.

52:35.061 --> 52:37.962
Are you here
as Miss O'Shaughnessy's representative?

52:38.165 --> 52:40.633
Well, there's nothing certain either way.
It depends.

52:40.700 --> 52:41.962
It depends on?

52:42.802 --> 52:44.770
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo.

52:44.838 --> 52:45.930
Maybe.

52:46.006 --> 52:49.134
The question is then which you represent.
It'll be one or the other.

52:49.209 --> 52:50.733
I didn't say so.

52:51.645 --> 52:53.704
- Who else is there?
- There's me.

52:56.483 --> 52:58.314
That's wonderful, sir, wonderful.

52:58.385 --> 53:01.877
I do like a man who tells you right out
he's looking out for himself.

53:01.955 --> 53:03.422
Don't we all?

53:03.523 --> 53:05.821
I don't trust a man who says he's not.

53:07.227 --> 53:09.457
Now, let's talk about the black bird.

53:09.629 --> 53:10.721
Let's.

53:11.131 --> 53:13.395
Mr. Spade, have you any conception

53:13.800 --> 53:16.735
of how much money can be got
for that black bird?

53:16.970 --> 53:17.994
No.

53:18.171 --> 53:22.403
Well, sir, if I told you,
if I told you half, you'd call me a liar.

53:22.475 --> 53:24.238
No, not even if I thought so.

53:24.311 --> 53:27.576
But you tell me what it is,
and I'll figure out the profit.

53:30.884 --> 53:33.114
You mean, you don't know
what the bird is?

53:33.186 --> 53:35.654
I know what it's supposed to look like,

53:35.722 --> 53:38.816
and I know the value in human life
you people put on it.

53:38.892 --> 53:41.053
She didn't tell you what it is?

53:41.862 --> 53:45.127
- Cairo didn't, either?
- He offered me $10,000 for it.

53:45.198 --> 53:46.426
$10,000.

53:46.933 --> 53:49.094
Dollars, mind you, not even pounds.

53:49.869 --> 53:52.736
Do they know what that bird is, sir?
What is your impression?

53:52.806 --> 53:54.273
There's not very much to go by.

53:54.341 --> 53:56.206
Cairo didn't say he did,
and he didn't say he didn't.

53:56.276 --> 53:59.575
She said she didn't,
but I took it for granted she was lying.

53:59.646 --> 54:01.637
Not an injudicious thing to do.

54:02.983 --> 54:07.215
If they don't know, I'm the only one
in the whole wide sweet world who does.

54:07.320 --> 54:10.153
Swell. When you've told me,
that'll make two of us.

54:10.223 --> 54:14.626
Mathematically correct, sir, but I don't
know for certain that I'm going to tell you.

54:14.694 --> 54:17.754
Don't be foolish. You know what it is.
I know where it is. That's why I'm here.

54:17.831 --> 54:19.594
Well, sir, where is it?

54:20.000 --> 54:24.198
You see, I must tell you what I know,
but you won't tell me what you know.

54:24.371 --> 54:26.396
It's hardly equitable, sir.

54:26.806 --> 54:30.105
No, no. I don't think we can do business
along those lines.

54:30.176 --> 54:32.337
Well, think again, and think fast!

54:32.445 --> 54:35.039
I told that gunsel of yours you'd have
to talk to me before you're through!

54:35.115 --> 54:37.606
I'm telling you now, you'll talk
to me today, or you are through!

54:37.684 --> 54:40.482
What are you wasting my time for?
I can get along without you!

54:40.553 --> 54:41.781
And another thing,

54:41.855 --> 54:44.187
keep that gunsel out of my way
while you're making up your mind.

54:44.257 --> 54:46.157
I'll kill him if you don't! I'll kill him!

54:46.226 --> 54:49.354
Well, sir, I must say
you have a most violent temper.

54:50.130 --> 54:52.724
Think it over. You've got till 5:00.

54:53.233 --> 54:55.997
Then you're either in or out, for keeps!

55:20.527 --> 55:22.927
- Who killed Thursby?
- I don't know.

55:22.996 --> 55:25.157
Perhaps you don't,
but you could make an excellent guess.

55:25.231 --> 55:27.358
My guess might be excellent
or it might be crummy,

55:27.434 --> 55:30.597
but Mrs. Spade didn't raise any children
dippy enough to make guesses

55:30.670 --> 55:33.969
in front of a district attorney, an assistant
district attorney and a stenographer.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.769
Why shouldn't you,
if you've nothing to conceal?

55:35.842 --> 55:37.742
Everybody has something to conceal.

55:37.811 --> 55:40.712
I'm a sworn officer of the law,
24 hours a day,

55:40.980 --> 55:44.313
and neither formality nor informality
justifies you withholding

55:44.384 --> 55:48.184
evidence of crime from me except,
of course, on constitutional grounds.

55:48.254 --> 55:50.381
Now, both you and the police
have as much as accused me

55:50.457 --> 55:52.516
of being mixed up
in the other night's murders.

55:52.592 --> 55:55.823
Well, I've had trouble with both of you
before, and as far as I can see,

55:55.895 --> 55:58.830
my best chance of clearing myself
of the trouble you're trying to make for me

55:58.898 --> 56:00.991
is by bringing in the murderers all tied up.

56:01.067 --> 56:02.500
And the only chance
I've got of catching them

56:02.569 --> 56:04.298
and tying them up and bringing them in

56:04.371 --> 56:06.362
is by staying as far away as possible
from you and the police,

56:06.439 --> 56:07.770
because you'd only gum up the works.

56:07.841 --> 56:09.934
You getting this all right, son,
or am I going too fast for you?

56:10.009 --> 56:12.705
- No, sir. I'm getting it all right.
- Good work.

56:13.113 --> 56:15.843
Now, if you want to go to the board
and tell them I'm obstructing justice

56:15.915 --> 56:18.076
and ask them to revoke my license,
hop to it.

56:18.151 --> 56:20.949
You tried it before, and it didn't get you
anything but a good laugh all around.

56:21.020 --> 56:23.420
- Now, look here.
- And I don't want any more informal talks.

56:23.490 --> 56:27.119
I've nothing to say to you or the police,
and I'm tired of being called things

56:27.193 --> 56:30.356
by every crackpot on the city payroll.
So, if you want to see me

56:30.430 --> 56:33.922
pinch me or subpoena me or something,
and I'll come down with my lawyer.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.161
I'll see you at the inquest, maybe.

56:39.572 --> 56:41.369
Come on. He wants to see you.

56:41.441 --> 56:45.309
I didn't expect you till 5:25.
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.

56:45.678 --> 56:46.872
Keep on riding me,

56:46.946 --> 56:49.744
they're gonna be picking iron
out of your liver.

56:50.083 --> 56:52.984
The cheaper the crook,
the gaudier the patter, huh?

56:53.253 --> 56:54.743
Now, let's go.

57:15.742 --> 57:18.575
Come on.
This'll put you in solid with your boss.

57:27.220 --> 57:29.620
Come in, sir. Thank you for coming.
Come in.

57:29.689 --> 57:32.055
Here. You shouldn't let him go around
with these on him.

57:32.125 --> 57:34.150
He might get himself hurt.

57:35.795 --> 57:37.126
Well, well, what's this?

57:37.197 --> 57:40.860
A crippled newsie took them away
from him. I made him give them back.

57:44.103 --> 57:48.767
By gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing.
An amazing character. Give me your hat.

57:53.246 --> 57:54.543
Sit down.

58:00.386 --> 58:03.048
- I owe you an apology, sir.
- Now, never mind that.

58:03.389 --> 58:05.414
Let's talk about the black bird.

58:05.625 --> 58:07.217
All right, sir, let's.

58:10.363 --> 58:11.557
Let's.

58:12.499 --> 58:15.832
This is going to be the most astounding
thing you've ever heard of, sir.

58:15.902 --> 58:19.133
And I say this knowing that a man
of your caliber and your profession

58:19.205 --> 58:22.231
must have known
some astounding things in his time.

58:22.642 --> 58:26.271
What do you know, sir, about the Order
of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem,

58:26.346 --> 58:28.507
later known as the Knights of Rhodes
and other things?

58:28.581 --> 58:31.982
- Crusaders or something, weren't they?
- Very good. Sit down.

58:34.787 --> 58:36.914
In 1539, these crusading Knights

58:36.990 --> 58:40.323
persuaded Emperor Charles V
to give them the island of Malta.

58:40.393 --> 58:42.293
He made but one condition,

58:42.362 --> 58:44.853
that they pay him each year
the tribute of a falcon

58:44.931 --> 58:47.593
in acknowledgement that Malta
was still under Spain.

58:47.667 --> 58:49.259
Do you follow me?

58:51.204 --> 58:53.263
Have you any conception of the extreme,

58:53.339 --> 58:55.705
the immeasurable wealth
of the Order of that time?

58:55.775 --> 58:57.402
I imagine they were pretty well fixed.

58:57.477 --> 59:01.038
"Pretty well" is putting it mildly.
They were rolling in wealth, sir.

59:01.114 --> 59:04.675
For years they'd taken from the East
nobody knows what spoils of gems,

59:04.751 --> 59:07.049
precious metals, silks, ivory, sir.

59:07.220 --> 59:11.179
We all know the holy wars to them
were largely a matter of loot.

59:11.758 --> 59:14.886
The Knights were profoundly grateful
to the Emperor Charles

59:14.961 --> 59:17.088
for his generosity toward them.

59:17.163 --> 59:19.063
They hit upon the happy thought
of sending him,

59:19.132 --> 59:22.693
for his first year's tribute,
not an insignificant live bird

59:23.269 --> 59:25.396
but a glorious golden falcon

59:25.605 --> 59:27.573
crusted from head to foot

59:27.640 --> 59:30.165
with the finest jewels in their coffers.

59:31.144 --> 59:32.270
Well, sir,

59:32.345 --> 59:34.575
- what do you think of that?
- I don't know.

59:34.647 --> 59:36.581
These are facts, historical facts,

59:36.649 --> 59:40.881
not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells'
history, but history, nevertheless.

59:41.020 --> 59:43.750
They sent this foot-high jeweled bird
to Charles, who was then in Spain.

59:43.823 --> 59:47.088
They sent it in a galley commanded
by a member of the Order.

59:48.161 --> 59:50.061
It never reached Spain.

59:50.563 --> 59:52.656
A famous admiral of buccaneers

59:53.099 --> 59:55.567
took the Knights' galley and the bird.

59:56.102 --> 59:58.900
In 1713, it turned up in Sicily.

59:59.772 --> 01:00:02.297
In 1840, it appeared in Paris.

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:05.636
It had, by that time,
acquired a coat of black enamel,

01:00:05.712 --> 01:00:09.808
so that it looked nothing more
than a fairly interesting black statuette.

01:00:10.016 --> 01:00:13.713
In that disguise, sir, it was,
as you may say, kicked around Paris

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.280
for over three score years
by private owners too stupid

01:00:17.357 --> 01:00:19.291
to see what it was under the skin.

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:20.519
Then,

01:00:21.194 --> 01:00:23.822
in 1923, a Greek dealer

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.822
named Charilaos Konstantinides found it
in an obscure shop.

01:00:29.435 --> 01:00:33.838
No thickness of enamel
could conceal value from his eyes.

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:40.309
- You begin to believe me a little?
- I haven't said I didn't.

01:00:40.446 --> 01:00:45.213
Well, sir, to hold it safe while pursuing
his researches into its history,

01:00:45.585 --> 01:00:47.746
Charilaos re-enameled the bird.

01:00:48.254 --> 01:00:52.020
Despite this precaution, however,
I got wind of his find.

01:00:54.661 --> 01:00:56.652
If I'd only known a few days sooner.

01:00:56.729 --> 01:00:58.287
I was in London when I heard.

01:00:58.364 --> 01:01:00.594
I packed a bag,
got on the boat train immediately.

01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:02.464
<i>On the train I opened the paper,
The Times,</i>

01:01:02.535 --> 01:01:04.059
and read that Charilaos's establishment

01:01:04.137 --> 01:01:06.605
had been burglarized and him murdered.

01:01:06.806 --> 01:01:10.674
Sure enough, on arriving there,
I discovered the bird was gone.

01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:13.940
That was 17 years ago.

01:01:14.747 --> 01:01:18.979
Well, sir, it took me 17 years
to locate that bird, but I did.

01:01:19.352 --> 01:01:20.649
I wanted it.

01:01:20.887 --> 01:01:23.754
I'm a man not easily discouraged
when I want something.

01:01:23.823 --> 01:01:25.916
I traced it to the home
of a Russian general,

01:01:25.992 --> 01:01:30.156
one Kemidov, in an Istanbul suburb.
He didn't know a thing about it.

01:01:30.263 --> 01:01:32.424
It was nothing
but a black-enameled figure to him,

01:01:32.498 --> 01:01:35.160
but his natural contrariness kept him
from selling it to me

01:01:35.234 --> 01:01:39.136
when I made him an offer.
So I sent him some agents to get it.

01:01:39.439 --> 01:01:40.701
Well, sir,

01:01:40.773 --> 01:01:43.298
they got it and I haven't got it.

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.076
But I'm going to get it.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.745
Your glass.

01:01:48.915 --> 01:01:52.942
Then the bird doesn't really belong
to any of you, but to a General Kemidov?

01:01:53.019 --> 01:01:56.614
Well, sir, you might as well say
it belonged to the King of Spain.

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:00.717
I don't see how you can honestly grant
anyone else a clear title to it

01:02:00.793 --> 01:02:02.886
except by right of possession.

01:02:03.529 --> 01:02:04.826
And now, sir,

01:02:05.264 --> 01:02:08.529
before we start to talk prices,
how soon can you

01:02:08.735 --> 01:02:11.169
or how soon are you willing
to produce the Falcon?

01:02:11.237 --> 01:02:13.603
- A couple of days.
- That is satisfactory.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.599
Well, sir, here's to a fair bargain.
Profits large enough for both of us.

01:02:18.878 --> 01:02:20.937
What's your idea of a fair bargain?

01:02:21.013 --> 01:02:24.608
I will give you $25,000
when you deliver the Falcon to me

01:02:25.118 --> 01:02:26.847
and another $25,000 later on.

01:02:26.919 --> 01:02:30.355
Or I will give you one quarter
of what I realize on the Falcon.

01:02:30.423 --> 01:02:32.254
That would amount
to a vastly greater sum.

01:02:32.325 --> 01:02:35.351
- How much greater?
- Who knows? Shall we say $100,000?

01:02:35.628 --> 01:02:38.222
Would you believe me if I name a sum
that seems the probable minimum?

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:39.525
Why not?

01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:42.193
What would you say
to a quarter of a million?

01:02:44.404 --> 01:02:46.634
Then you think the dingus
is worth a million, huh?

01:02:46.706 --> 01:02:48.537
In your own words, why not?

01:02:52.678 --> 01:02:55.374
- That's a lot of dough.
- A lot of dough.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:59.413
Minimum, huh? What's the maximum?

01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:01.817
The maximum, I refuse to guess.

01:03:02.922 --> 01:03:04.446
You'd think me crazy.

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:05.918
I don't know.

01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:09.254
There's no telling how high it could go, sir.

01:03:09.429 --> 01:03:12.159
That is the one and only truth about it.

01:03:29.415 --> 01:03:30.473
Wilmer!

01:04:58.683 --> 01:05:00.310
Hello, Effie. It's me.

01:05:00.652 --> 01:05:02.779
Let me talk to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

01:05:03.621 --> 01:05:05.111
Isn't there?

01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:09.793
What? She didn't show up?

01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:15.860
Listen, you get on back to the office and
wait there till I come or you hear from me.

01:05:15.934 --> 01:05:18.767
Yeah, let's do something right
for a change.

01:06:11.422 --> 01:06:13.913
It started in the hold aft,
in the rear basement.

01:06:13.992 --> 01:06:15.687
What insurance was she carrying?

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.920
- Anybody burnt?
- No.

01:06:16.995 --> 01:06:19.088
Only the harbor watch was aboard!

01:06:20.598 --> 01:06:22.259
- Someone I know came...
- Huh?

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:24.460
Someone I know came aboard
this afternoon,

01:06:24.536 --> 01:06:26.766
and I haven't seen her since. I'm worried.

01:06:26.838 --> 01:06:29.671
No reason to be, mister.
Everybody got off all right.

01:06:29.741 --> 01:06:33.575
I wonder if you saw her.
She's kind of small, about 5-foot...

01:06:33.645 --> 01:06:38.309
I couldn't tell you, mister. But if
she come aboard, she got off all right.

01:06:38.383 --> 01:06:41.648
Only the harbor watch was aboard
when the fire started.

01:06:43.721 --> 01:06:46.349
Now you know as much about it
as I do, precious.

01:06:46.424 --> 01:06:48.984
Maybe they went down to the ship.
Maybe they didn't.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.324
The part about the bird is thrilling.

01:06:52.363 --> 01:06:53.762
Or ridiculous.

01:07:05.276 --> 01:07:06.538
You know.

01:07:09.314 --> 01:07:10.508
Falcon.

01:07:16.888 --> 01:07:18.378
Lock that door.

01:07:35.873 --> 01:07:36.965
Is...

01:07:37.642 --> 01:07:39.610
- Is he...
- Yeah.

01:07:42.046 --> 01:07:45.106
He couldn't have come far
with those holes in him.

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:56.453
Why couldn't he have stayed alive
long enough to tell us something?

01:07:57.328 --> 01:08:00.661
Here, here, here, none of that now.
Come on.

01:08:01.466 --> 01:08:04.526
- You can't pass out on me now.
- All right, Sam.

01:08:13.378 --> 01:08:15.175
Do you really think it's...

01:08:29.127 --> 01:08:32.187
- We've got it, angel, we've got it!
- You're hurting me.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:35.523
Answer the phone.

01:08:38.435 --> 01:08:39.595
Hello.

01:08:39.671 --> 01:08:40.763
Yes.

01:08:41.272 --> 01:08:42.432
Who?

01:08:44.509 --> 01:08:45.737
Oh, yes.

01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:47.705
Where?

01:08:48.446 --> 01:08:49.777
Yes, yes.

01:08:51.482 --> 01:08:53.609
Hello? Hello! Hello!

01:08:53.685 --> 01:08:56.346
That was Miss O'Shaughnessy.
She wants you. She's in danger.

01:08:56.421 --> 01:08:58.286
- Where is she?
- Burlingame, 26 Ancho.

01:08:58.356 --> 01:08:59.845
Sam, her voice, it was awful.

01:08:59.924 --> 01:09:02.916
And something happened to her
before she could finish. Go help her, Sam!

01:09:02.993 --> 01:09:06.430
You've got to go to her, don't you see?
He was helping her, and they killed him...

01:09:06.497 --> 01:09:07.964
You've got to go, Sam!

01:09:08.032 --> 01:09:09.590
All right, I'll go.

01:09:10.068 --> 01:09:12.036
Now, after I've gone, you phone the police.

01:09:12.103 --> 01:09:14.502
Tell them how it happened, but don't
drag any names in. You don't know.

01:09:14.572 --> 01:09:17.506
I got the phone call and told you I had
to go, but I didn't say where.

01:09:17.575 --> 01:09:20.442
Now forget about this thing. Tell them
how it happened, but without the bundle.

01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:23.604
Now get that straight. Everything
happened exactly as it did happen,

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.673
but without the bundle,
and I got the phone call, not you.

01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:28.742
- Yes, Sam.
- Okay.

01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:35.688
Shut this door and lock it behind me
and don't open it till the police come.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.022
Do you know who he is?

01:09:37.095 --> 01:09:40.326
<i>Yeah, it's Captain Jacoby,
master of the La Paloma.</i>

01:09:40.997 --> 01:09:43.091
You're a good man, sister.

01:10:03.721 --> 01:10:05.746
- Can I borrow your pencil?
- Sure.

01:10:31.682 --> 01:10:33.479
- Say, Frank?
- Hello, Mr. Spade.

01:10:33.551 --> 01:10:35.246
- You got plenty of gas?
- Sure thing.

01:10:35.319 --> 01:10:37.446
Do you know where Ancho Street
or Avenue is in Burlingame?

01:10:37.522 --> 01:10:38.921
Nope, but if she's there, we can find her.

01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:40.651
Well, 26 is the number
and the sooner the better.

01:10:40.725 --> 01:10:41.919
All right.

01:10:51.335 --> 01:10:53.030
Keep your motor running.

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.357
- Bum steer, Mr. Spade?
- Yeah.

01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:29.602
Let's get to a phone booth.

01:11:30.308 --> 01:11:32.367
Hello, Mrs. Perine? Is Effie there?

01:11:32.443 --> 01:11:33.774
Yes, please.

01:11:35.112 --> 01:11:37.478
Hello, precious. What's the good news?

01:11:37.882 --> 01:11:41.249
No, no. It was a bum steer.
Are you sure that was her voice?

01:11:41.652 --> 01:11:43.244
Well, it was hooey.

01:11:43.788 --> 01:11:47.087
Everything go all right?
Nothing said about the bundle, huh?

01:11:47.325 --> 01:11:48.587
That's swell.

01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:50.820
They take you down to the hall?

01:11:51.963 --> 01:11:53.157
All right, precious.

01:11:53.231 --> 01:11:57.031
You better hit the hay and get
a good night's rest. You sound all in.

01:11:57.101 --> 01:11:59.934
No, no. Save it till tomorrow.
I'm going on home.

01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:08.869
- Thanks. Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Mr. Spade.

01:12:16.187 --> 01:12:18.178
I've been hiding in a doorway
up the street.

01:12:18.256 --> 01:12:20.053
I thought you'd never come.

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:31.860
Can you make it all right,
or shall I carry you?

01:12:31.936 --> 01:12:35.804
I'll be all right as soon as I can
get some place where I can lie down.

01:12:49.086 --> 01:12:50.383
Well, sir, we're all here.

01:12:50.454 --> 01:12:53.252
Now, let's come in and sit down
and be comfortable and talk.

01:12:53.324 --> 01:12:54.518
Sure.

01:12:55.226 --> 01:12:58.753
- Get away. You're not gonna frisk me.
- Stand still. Shut up.

01:12:58.829 --> 01:13:01.423
Take your paws off me,
or I'll make you use that gun.

01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:04.434
Ask your boss if he wants me shot up
before we talk.

01:13:04.735 --> 01:13:06.202
Never mind, Wilmer.

01:13:08.039 --> 01:13:10.735
You certainly are
a most headstrong individual.

01:13:11.075 --> 01:13:12.940
Well, let's be seated.

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.375
Are you ready to make the first payment
and take the Falcon off my hands?

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:21.645
Well, sir, as to that...

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.110
As to that...

01:13:28.826 --> 01:13:31.818
$10,000? We were talking about
a lot more money than this.

01:13:31.896 --> 01:13:34.956
Yes, sir, we were.
But this is genuine coin of the realm.

01:13:35.032 --> 01:13:37.432
With a dollar of this,
you can buy $10 of talk.

01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:39.901
And there are more of us
to be taken care of now.

01:13:39.971 --> 01:13:42.132
That may be, but I've got the Falcon.

01:13:42.206 --> 01:13:44.800
I shouldn't think it would be necessary
to remind you, Mr. Spade,

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:47.810
that you may have the Falcon,
but we certainly have you.

01:13:48.179 --> 01:13:51.376
Yeah, I'm trying not to let that worry me.
We'll get back to the money later on.

01:13:51.449 --> 01:13:54.145
There's something else
to be discussed first.

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.051
We've got to have a fall guy.

01:13:58.122 --> 01:13:59.419
The police have got to have a victim,

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:01.788
somebody they can pin
those three murders on.

01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:05.454
Three? But there's only two, because
Thursby certainly killed your partner.

01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:07.258
All right. Only two then.
What difference does it make?

01:14:07.331 --> 01:14:08.923
The point is, we've got to give the police...

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.527
Come, come, Mr. Spade, you can't
expect us to believe at this late date

01:14:12.603 --> 01:14:14.628
that you're the least bit afraid
of the police,

01:14:14.705 --> 01:14:17.936
- or that you're not quite able to handle...
- I'm in this up to my neck, Gutman.

01:14:18.009 --> 01:14:22.378
I've got to find somebody, a victim,
when the time comes. If I don't, I'll be it.

01:14:27.651 --> 01:14:29.744
Let's give them the gunsel.

01:14:30.121 --> 01:14:32.885
He actually did shoot Thursby and Jacoby,
didn't he?

01:14:32.957 --> 01:14:35.721
Anyway, he's made to order for the part.
Look at him.

01:14:35.793 --> 01:14:37.420
Let's give him to them.

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:42.326
By gad, sir, you are a character.
That you are.

01:14:42.566 --> 01:14:45.228
There's never any telling
what you'll say or do next,

01:14:45.302 --> 01:14:47.293
except that it's bound
to be something astonishing.

01:14:47.371 --> 01:14:49.339
Why, it's our best bet.
With him in their hands...

01:14:49.407 --> 01:14:52.570
But, my dear man, can't you see
that if I, even for a moment,

01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:55.237
thought of doing such a thing...
That's ridiculous.

01:14:55.312 --> 01:14:58.941
I feel towards Wilmer here just exactly
as if he were my own son.

01:14:59.016 --> 01:15:00.142
Really, I do.

01:15:00.217 --> 01:15:03.152
But if I even for a moment thought
of doing what you propose,

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.553
what in the world would keep Wilmer
from telling the police

01:15:06.624 --> 01:15:09.092
every last detail about the Falcon and all...

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.559
Let him talk his head off.

01:15:10.628 --> 01:15:13.756
I'll guarantee you
nobody'll do anything about it.

01:15:14.065 --> 01:15:16.898
Well, what do you think of this, Wilmer?
Mighty funny.

01:15:16.967 --> 01:15:18.434
Mighty funny.

01:15:22.073 --> 01:15:24.541
How do you feel now?
Any better, precious?

01:15:24.642 --> 01:15:25.973
Much better.

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:28.009
But I'm frightened.

01:15:28.079 --> 01:15:30.946
Well, don't be.
Nothing very bad's going to happen here.

01:15:31.215 --> 01:15:33.206
You want a drink, angel?

01:15:33.517 --> 01:15:35.144
Be careful, Sam.

01:15:37.988 --> 01:15:39.080
Well?

01:15:39.156 --> 01:15:40.817
If you're really serious about this,

01:15:40.891 --> 01:15:43.621
the least we can do in common politeness
is to hear you out.

01:15:43.694 --> 01:15:46.219
Now, how would you be able to fix it

01:15:46.597 --> 01:15:48.827
so that Wilmer couldn't do us any harm?

01:15:48.899 --> 01:15:51.493
I can show Bryan, our district attorney,
that if he goes around

01:15:51.569 --> 01:15:54.129
trying to collect everybody,
he's gonna have a tangled case,

01:15:54.205 --> 01:15:57.072
but if he sticks to Wilmer here,

01:15:57.274 --> 01:16:00.243
he can get a conviction
standing on his head.

01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:05.142
Get up on your feet.

01:16:05.216 --> 01:16:08.185
I've taken all the riding from you
I'm gonna take.

01:16:08.486 --> 01:16:10.010
Get up and shoot it out!

01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:11.748
Young Wild West.

01:16:11.922 --> 01:16:13.617
Maybe you'd better tell him
that shooting me

01:16:13.691 --> 01:16:16.387
before you get your hands on the Falcon
is gonna be bad for business.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.156
Now, now, Wilmer.
We can't have any of that.

01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:21.698
You shouldn't let yourself attach
so much importance to these things.

01:16:21.766 --> 01:16:23.290
Then tell him to lay off me then.

01:16:23.367 --> 01:16:24.664
Now, Wilmer...

01:16:27.037 --> 01:16:31.599
Your plan is not at all satisfactory, sir.
Let's not say anything more about it.

01:16:31.675 --> 01:16:33.734
All right. I've got another suggestion.

01:16:33.811 --> 01:16:36.871
It may not be as good as the first one,
but it's better than nothing.

01:16:36.947 --> 01:16:39.507
- You want to hear it?
- Most assuredly.

01:16:43.621 --> 01:16:45.111
Give them Cairo.

01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:46.951
Well, by gad, sir...

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:49.652
And suppose we give them you
or Miss O'Shaughnessy? How about that?

01:16:49.727 --> 01:16:51.524
You want the Falcon. I've got it.

01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:55.258
The fall guy's part of the price I'm asking.
As for Miss O'Shaughnessy,

01:16:55.332 --> 01:16:59.234
if you think she can be rigged for the part,
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it with you.

01:16:59.303 --> 01:17:03.103
You seem to forget that you are not
in a position at all to insist upon anything.

01:17:03.174 --> 01:17:04.402
Now, come, gentlemen.

01:17:04.475 --> 01:17:07.103
Let's keep our discussion
on a friendly basis.

01:17:07.878 --> 01:17:10.938
There certainly is something
in what Mr. Cairo said.

01:17:11.682 --> 01:17:15.049
If you kill me,
how are you gonna get the bird?

01:17:15.119 --> 01:17:16.814
And if I know you can't afford to kill me,

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:18.946
how are you going to scare me
into giving it to you?

01:17:19.023 --> 01:17:23.187
Sir, there are other means of persuasion
besides killing and threatening to kill.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.693
Yes, that's...

01:17:25.896 --> 01:17:27.329
That's true.

01:17:28.933 --> 01:17:32.926
But they're none of them any good
unless the threat of death is behind them.

01:17:33.003 --> 01:17:34.368
You see what I mean?

01:17:34.438 --> 01:17:37.805
If you start something, I'll make it
a matter of your having to kill me

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:39.342
or call it off.

01:17:40.344 --> 01:17:44.576
That's an attitude, sir, that calls for
the most delicate judgment on both sides.

01:17:44.648 --> 01:17:46.912
Because, as you know, sir,
in the heat of action,

01:17:46.984 --> 01:17:49.953
men are likely to forget
where their best interests lie

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.352
and let their emotions carry them away.

01:17:52.423 --> 01:17:55.688
Then the trick from my angle is
to make my play strong enough

01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:58.694
to tie you up, but not make you
mad enough to bump me off

01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:00.024
against your better judgment.

01:18:00.097 --> 01:18:03.032
By gad, sir, you are a character.

01:18:08.372 --> 01:18:11.170
Six-two uneven.
They're selling you out, sonny.

01:18:11.809 --> 01:18:14.243
I hope you're not letting yourself
be influenced by the guns

01:18:14.311 --> 01:18:17.144
these pocket-edition desperadoes
are waving around.

01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:20.411
Because I've practiced taking guns away
from these boys before,

01:18:20.484 --> 01:18:22.816
so we'll have no trouble there.

01:18:23.087 --> 01:18:24.520
- Wilmer, here is...
- All right.

01:18:24.588 --> 01:18:27.056
Wilmer. Wilmer!

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:28.958
Wilmer!

01:18:57.988 --> 01:18:59.478
There's our fall guy.

01:18:59.556 --> 01:19:02.753
Either you'll say yes right now, or I'll turn
the Falcon and the whole lot of you in.

01:19:02.826 --> 01:19:04.088
Don't like that, sir.

01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:06.288
You won't like it. Well?

01:19:11.101 --> 01:19:12.693
You can have him.

01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:16.967
I won't be able to get the Falcon
till daylight, or maybe later.

01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:20.340
It strikes me it'd be best for all concerned
if we did not get out of each other's sight

01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:23.812
until our business has been transacted.
You have the envelope?

01:19:23.881 --> 01:19:26.247
Miss O'Shaughnessy has it.
That's all right. Hang on to it.

01:19:26.317 --> 01:19:29.514
We don't have to lose sight of each other.
The dingus'll be brought to us here.

01:19:29.586 --> 01:19:31.213
Excellent, sir, excellent.

01:19:31.288 --> 01:19:33.620
And in exchange for the $10,000
and Wilmer,

01:19:33.691 --> 01:19:36.319
you'll give us the Falcon
and an hour or two of grace.

01:19:36.393 --> 01:19:38.759
Now, let's get the details fixed, first.

01:19:38.829 --> 01:19:43.198
Why did he shoot Thursby and why, where
and how did he shoot Captain Jacoby?

01:19:43.267 --> 01:19:45.326
You see, I've got to know
all that happened, so I can be sure

01:19:45.402 --> 01:19:47.302
the parts that don't fit are covered up.

01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:49.396
I shall be candid with you, sir.

01:19:49.473 --> 01:19:51.941
Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally.

01:19:52.009 --> 01:19:54.102
We believed that disposing of him
in the manner we did

01:19:54.178 --> 01:19:58.114
would cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stop
and think that, perhaps, it would be best

01:19:58.182 --> 01:20:01.481
to patch up her differences with us
regarding the Falcon.

01:20:01.719 --> 01:20:04.688
Then you didn't try to make a deal
with him before giving him the works?

01:20:04.755 --> 01:20:06.950
We did. Yes, sir. We most certainly did.

01:20:07.024 --> 01:20:10.516
I talked to him myself that very night,
but I could do nothing with him.

01:20:10.594 --> 01:20:13.586
He was quite determinedly loyal
to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

01:20:14.765 --> 01:20:18.132
So Wilmer followed him back to the hotel
and did what he did.

01:20:18.702 --> 01:20:20.431
That sounds all right.

01:20:21.238 --> 01:20:22.671
Now, Jacoby.

01:20:24.008 --> 01:20:27.910
Captain Jacoby's death was entirely
Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.

01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.677
Tell me what happened.

01:20:30.748 --> 01:20:33.239
Well, Cairo, as you must have surmised,
got in touch with me

01:20:33.317 --> 01:20:36.115
after he left police headquarters
yesterday night or morning.

01:20:36.186 --> 01:20:39.451
He recognized the mutual advantage
of pooling forces.

01:20:39.523 --> 01:20:42.083
Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgment.

01:20:42.226 --> 01:20:45.684
<i>The Paloma was his thought. He saw
the notice of its arrival in the papers</i>

01:20:45.763 --> 01:20:48.061
and remembered he had heard
in Hong Kong

01:20:48.132 --> 01:20:51.363
that Jacoby and Miss O'Shaughnessy
were seen together.

01:20:54.338 --> 01:20:56.363
Well, sir, he saw that notice

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.000
and, putting two and two together,
guessed the truth.

01:20:59.076 --> 01:21:01.738
She had given the bird to Jacoby
to bring here for her.

01:21:01.812 --> 01:21:04.280
And at that juncture,
you decided to slip me a Mickey, huh?

01:21:04.348 --> 01:21:06.782
There was no place for you in our plan, sir.

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:10.479
So we decided to spare ourselves
any possible embarrassment.

01:21:11.355 --> 01:21:14.586
Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I
went to call on Captain Jacoby.

01:21:15.259 --> 01:21:18.626
We were lucky enough to arrive
while Miss O'Shaughnessy was there.

01:21:18.695 --> 01:21:22.153
In many ways, the conference was
difficult, but we finally persuaded

01:21:22.232 --> 01:21:25.326
Miss O'Shaughnessy to come to terms,
or so we thought.

01:21:25.402 --> 01:21:27.870
We then left the boat
and set out for my hotel,

01:21:27.938 --> 01:21:31.374
where I was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessy
and receive the bird.

01:21:31.508 --> 01:21:34.136
Well, sir, we mere men
should have known better.

01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:36.771
En route, she, Captain Jacoby
and the Falcon

01:21:36.847 --> 01:21:39.475
slipped completely through our fingers.

01:21:39.683 --> 01:21:42.151
It was neatly done, sir. Indeed, it was.

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.181
You touched off the boat before you left?

01:21:45.255 --> 01:21:46.722
No, not intentionally.

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:50.521
Though, I daresay, we, or Wilmer at least,
were responsible for the fire.

01:21:50.594 --> 01:21:55.122
While the rest of us were talking
in the cabin, Wilmer went about the boat,

01:21:55.632 --> 01:21:57.532
trying to find the Falcon.

01:21:58.469 --> 01:22:00.699
No doubt, he was careless with matches.

01:22:00.771 --> 01:22:02.329
How about the shooting?

01:22:02.406 --> 01:22:05.933
We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessy
and Jacoby at her apartment.

01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:10.002
I sent Wilmer downstairs to cover
the fire escape before ringing the bell.

01:22:10.447 --> 01:22:14.008
And, sure enough, while she was asking us
who we were through the door,

01:22:14.084 --> 01:22:16.780
and we were telling her,
we heard a window go up.

01:22:16.854 --> 01:22:19.880
Wilmer shot Jacoby
as he was coming down the fire escape,

01:22:19.957 --> 01:22:23.950
shot him more than once, but Jacoby
was too tough to fall or drop the Falcon.

01:22:24.027 --> 01:22:27.861
He climbed down the rest of the way,
knocked Wilmer over and ran off.

01:22:29.299 --> 01:22:33.030
We persuaded, that is the word, sir,
we persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy

01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:36.163
to tell us where she had told
Captain Jacoby to take the Falcon.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.708
And we further persuaded her
to phone your office

01:22:38.775 --> 01:22:41.903
in an attempt to draw you away
before Jacoby got there,

01:22:41.979 --> 01:22:43.571
but, unfortunately for us,

01:22:43.647 --> 01:22:46.912
it had taken us too long
to persuade Miss O'Shaughnessy.

01:22:47.284 --> 01:22:49.343
And you had the Falcon
before we could reach you.

01:23:04.668 --> 01:23:07.569
Well, Wilmer, I'm sorry indeed to lose you,
but I want you to know

01:23:07.638 --> 01:23:10.368
I couldn't be fonder of you
if you were my own son.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.466
But, well, if you lose a son,
it's possible to get another.

01:23:14.044 --> 01:23:16.205
There's only one Maltese Falcon.

01:23:17.481 --> 01:23:20.780
When you're young,
you simply don't understand these things.

01:23:22.819 --> 01:23:25.413
How about some coffee?
Put the pot on, will you, angel?

01:23:25.489 --> 01:23:27.582
I don't like to leave our guests.

01:23:27.691 --> 01:23:28.817
Surely.

01:23:28.892 --> 01:23:32.726
Just a moment, my dear. Hadn't you
better leave the envelope in here?

01:23:34.464 --> 01:23:36.261
Sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.

01:23:36.333 --> 01:23:38.301
You misunderstand me. It's not that at all.

01:23:38.368 --> 01:23:41.826
But business should be transacted
in a businesslike manner.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.666
For instance,
there are only nine bills here now.

01:23:46.743 --> 01:23:50.270
There were 10 when I handed them to you,
as you very well know.

01:23:56.987 --> 01:23:58.147
Well?

01:23:58.255 --> 01:24:00.086
I want to know about this.

01:24:07.831 --> 01:24:09.196
You palmed it.

01:24:09.299 --> 01:24:10.391
- I palmed it?
- Yes.

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:12.526
Do you want to say so,
or do you want to stand for a frisk?

01:24:12.603 --> 01:24:15.766
You're going to admit it, or I'm gonna
search you. There's no third way.

01:24:15.839 --> 01:24:17.602
By gad, I believe you would. I really do.

01:24:17.674 --> 01:24:19.699
You are a character,
if you don't mind my saying so.

01:24:19.776 --> 01:24:21.243
You palmed it.

01:24:21.812 --> 01:24:23.677
Yes, sir, that I did.

01:24:28.418 --> 01:24:30.716
I must have my little joke now and then.

01:24:30.787 --> 01:24:33.847
And I was curious to know what
you would do in a situation of this sort.

01:24:33.924 --> 01:24:36.290
I must say you passed the test
with flying colors.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.794
It's the sort of a thing I'd expect
from somebody Wilmer's age.

01:24:38.862 --> 01:24:41.626
This will soon be yours.
You might as well take it.

01:24:41.698 --> 01:24:43.393
I ought to have more than $10,000.

01:24:43.467 --> 01:24:45.867
Of course, sir. You understand
this is the first payment. Later.

01:24:45.936 --> 01:24:48.598
Oh, yes. Later you'll give me millions,

01:24:48.672 --> 01:24:50.572
but how's about $15,000 now?

01:24:50.874 --> 01:24:54.241
Frankly and candidly,
upon my word of honor as a gentleman,

01:24:54.745 --> 01:24:57.339
$10,000 is all the money I can raise.

01:24:58.582 --> 01:25:00.516
But you didn't say positively.

01:25:00.917 --> 01:25:02.214
Positively.

01:25:07.491 --> 01:25:09.789
I'd like to give you a word of advice.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:10.884
Go ahead.

01:25:12.462 --> 01:25:14.020
I daresay you're going to
give her some money,

01:25:14.097 --> 01:25:16.565
but if you don't give her
as much as she thinks she ought to have,

01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:19.101
my word of advice is be careful.

01:25:22.506 --> 01:25:23.803
Dangerous?

01:25:24.508 --> 01:25:25.532
Very.

01:25:26.777 --> 01:25:29.746
- How's the coffee coming, angel?
- In a few minutes.

01:25:29.813 --> 01:25:32.111
It's almost daylight, Mr. Spade.

01:25:32.449 --> 01:25:34.508
Can you start getting it now?

01:25:34.785 --> 01:25:36.150
I guess so.

01:25:49.266 --> 01:25:50.392
Hello?

01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:53.734
Hello, precious.
I'm sorry to get you up so early.

01:25:54.171 --> 01:25:56.469
Now, listen carefully. Here's the plot.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:00.533
In the holland box at the post office
there's an envelope with my scrawl.

01:26:00.977 --> 01:26:05.346
In that envelope, there's a parcel-room
check for the bundle we got yesterday.

01:26:06.116 --> 01:26:09.108
Now, get that bundle
and bring it here, PDQ.

01:26:09.186 --> 01:26:12.349
That's a good girl. Now hustle. Goodbye.

01:27:01.738 --> 01:27:04.002
Thanks, lady.
Sorry to spoil your day of rest.

01:27:04.074 --> 01:27:06.235
Not the first one you've spoiled.
Anything else?

01:27:06.309 --> 01:27:08.641
- No. No, thanks.
- Bye-bye, then.

01:27:28.432 --> 01:27:29.956
There you are.

01:27:41.711 --> 01:27:44.145
Now, after 17 years...

01:28:23.019 --> 01:28:24.281
It is it.

01:28:25.722 --> 01:28:27.451
But we'll make sure.

01:28:45.041 --> 01:28:46.167
Fake.

01:28:46.243 --> 01:28:48.268
It's a phony! It's lead!

01:28:48.778 --> 01:28:50.040
It's lead!

01:28:50.447 --> 01:28:51.812
It's a fake!

01:28:52.816 --> 01:28:55.250
All right, you've had your little joke.
Now, tell us about it.

01:28:55.318 --> 01:28:56.717
No, Sam! No!

01:28:57.153 --> 01:28:59.451
That's the one I got from Kemidov.
I swear it!

01:28:59.522 --> 01:29:00.648
You.

01:29:01.958 --> 01:29:04.017
It's you who bungled it.

01:29:04.661 --> 01:29:07.459
You and your stupid attempt to buy it!

01:29:07.797 --> 01:29:10.527
Kemidov found out how valuable it was!

01:29:10.967 --> 01:29:13.265
No wonder we had
such an easy time stealing it!

01:29:13.336 --> 01:29:14.826
You imbecile!

01:29:14.905 --> 01:29:17.135
You bloated idiot!

01:29:17.207 --> 01:29:19.107
You stupid fathead, you!

01:29:47.637 --> 01:29:50.663
Yes, it's the Russian's hand.
There's no doubt about it.

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.207
Well, sir, what do you suggest?

01:29:52.275 --> 01:29:54.869
We stand here and shed tears
and call each other names,

01:29:54.945 --> 01:29:57.038
or shall we go to Istanbul?

01:29:58.481 --> 01:30:00.108
Are you going?

01:30:00.317 --> 01:30:04.276
Seventeen years I've wanted that little
item and have been trying to get it.

01:30:04.354 --> 01:30:06.948
If we must spend another year
on the quest,

01:30:07.023 --> 01:30:10.322
well, sir, it will be an additional
expenditure in time

01:30:10.393 --> 01:30:14.090
of only five
and fifteen-seventeenths percent.

01:30:14.664 --> 01:30:16.359
I'm going with you.

01:30:32.782 --> 01:30:34.010
Wilmer.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.347
A swell lot of thieves.

01:30:38.421 --> 01:30:41.584
We've little enough to boast about, sir,
but the world hasn't come to an end

01:30:41.658 --> 01:30:43.649
just because we've
run into a little setback.

01:30:43.727 --> 01:30:47.128
- I must ask you for that envelope.
- I held up my end. You got your dingus.

01:30:47.197 --> 01:30:49.495
It's your hard luck, not mine,
it wasn't what you wanted.

01:30:49.566 --> 01:30:51.557
Now, come, sir, we've all failed,

01:30:51.634 --> 01:30:55.627
and there's no reason for expecting
any of us to bear the whole brunt.

01:30:55.939 --> 01:30:58.669
In short, sir,
I must ask you for my $10,000.

01:31:03.013 --> 01:31:05.504
This'll take care of my time and expenses.

01:31:08.551 --> 01:31:10.519
Now, sir, we'll say goodbye to you,

01:31:10.587 --> 01:31:14.045
unless you care to undertake
the Istanbul expedition with us.

01:31:14.124 --> 01:31:15.386
You don't?

01:31:15.558 --> 01:31:17.958
Well, frankly, sir,
I'd like to have you along.

01:31:18.028 --> 01:31:20.656
You're a man of nice judgment
and many resources.

01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:22.197
Now that there's no alternative,

01:31:22.265 --> 01:31:24.233
I daresay you'll manage the police
without a fall guy.

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.494
I'll make out all right.

01:31:25.568 --> 01:31:28.628
Well, sir, the shortest farewells
are best. Adieu.

01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:36.509
<i>And to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy,
I leave the rara avis on the table there</i>

01:31:36.579 --> 01:31:38.206
as a little memento.

01:31:58.368 --> 01:32:00.359
Hello. Is Sergeant Polhaus there?

01:32:00.603 --> 01:32:02.901
Yeah. Put him on. This is Sam Spade.

01:32:04.274 --> 01:32:07.505
Hello. Tom? Now, listen.
I've got something for you. Here it is.

01:32:07.577 --> 01:32:10.671
Jacoby and Thursby were killed
by a kid named Wilmer Cook.

01:32:10.747 --> 01:32:14.308
Yeah. He's about 20 years old, 5'6",
wearing a gray overcoat.

01:32:14.451 --> 01:32:16.646
He's working for a man
named Kasper Gutman.

01:32:16.719 --> 01:32:19.381
Now, you can't miss Gutman.
He must weigh 300 pounds.

01:32:19.456 --> 01:32:21.321
That fellow Cairo's in with him, too.

01:32:21.391 --> 01:32:23.188
They just left here
for the Alexandria Hotel.

01:32:23.259 --> 01:32:25.591
But you'll have to move fast.
They're blowing town.

01:32:25.662 --> 01:32:27.789
Now, watch yourself when you go up
against the kid.

01:32:27.864 --> 01:32:29.593
Yes, that's right. Very.

01:32:29.666 --> 01:32:31.258
Now, good luck, Tom.

01:32:31.334 --> 01:32:33.859
They'll talk, when they're nailed, about us.
We're sitting on dynamite.

01:32:33.937 --> 01:32:37.065
We've only got minutes to get set
for the police. Now, give me all of it, fast.

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.700
When you first came to my office,
why did you want Thursby shadowed?

01:32:39.776 --> 01:32:42.301
I told you, Sam. I thought he was
betraying me, and I wanted to find out.

01:32:42.378 --> 01:32:43.675
That's a lie! You had Thursby hooked,

01:32:43.746 --> 01:32:46.806
and you knew it, and you wanted to get rid
of him before Jacoby came with the loot,

01:32:46.883 --> 01:32:49.647
so you wouldn't have to split it with him.
Isn't that so? What was your scheme?

01:32:49.719 --> 01:32:51.414
I thought if he knew
someone was following him,

01:32:51.488 --> 01:32:52.785
he'd be frightened into going away.

01:32:52.856 --> 01:32:55.552
Miles wasn't clumsy enough
to be spotted the first night.

01:32:55.625 --> 01:32:58.093
You told Thursby he was being followed.

01:33:00.497 --> 01:33:01.862
I told him.

01:33:03.066 --> 01:33:04.431
I told him.

01:33:05.301 --> 01:33:06.632
Yes, but please believe me, Sam.

01:33:06.703 --> 01:33:09.069
I wouldn't have told him
if I thought Floyd would kill him.

01:33:09.139 --> 01:33:11.607
If you thought he wouldn't kill Miles,
you were right, angel.

01:33:11.674 --> 01:33:14.074
Miles hadn't many brains,
but he'd had too many years experience

01:33:14.144 --> 01:33:16.578
as a detective to be caught like that
by a man he was shadowing

01:33:16.646 --> 01:33:19.638
up a blind alley with his gun on his hip
and his overcoat buttoned.

01:33:19.716 --> 01:33:22.150
But he'd have gone up there
with you, angel.

01:33:22.218 --> 01:33:24.482
He was just dumb enough for that.

01:33:24.821 --> 01:33:27.756
He'd have looked you up and down,
and licked his lips and gone,

01:33:27.824 --> 01:33:29.655
grinning from ear to ear.

01:33:29.793 --> 01:33:32.193
And you could have stood
as close to him as you liked in the dark

01:33:32.262 --> 01:33:34.822
and put a hole through him with a gun
you got from Thursby that evening.

01:33:34.898 --> 01:33:35.898
Don't, Sam. Don't say that!

01:33:35.965 --> 01:33:37.694
Stop it! The police'll be here any minute!
Now talk!

01:33:37.767 --> 01:33:38.893
Why do you accuse me...

01:33:38.968 --> 01:33:40.731
This isn't the time for that schoolgirl act!

01:33:40.803 --> 01:33:42.395
We're both of us
sitting under the gallows!

01:33:42.472 --> 01:33:44.633
Now, why did you shoot Miles?

01:33:45.708 --> 01:33:48.700
I didn't mean to at first, really, I didn't.

01:33:49.746 --> 01:33:52.647
But when I found out
that Floyd couldn't be frightened...

01:33:52.715 --> 01:33:54.740
I can't look at you and tell you this, Sam!

01:33:54.817 --> 01:33:57.843
You thought Thursby would tackle Miles
and one or the other would go down.

01:33:57.921 --> 01:33:59.445
If Thursby was killed, you were rid of him.

01:33:59.522 --> 01:34:01.752
If it was Miles, you'd see that Thursby
was caught and set up for it.

01:34:01.825 --> 01:34:03.292
- Isn't that right?
- Something like that.

01:34:03.359 --> 01:34:05.054
When you found that Thursby
wasn't going to tackle him,

01:34:05.128 --> 01:34:07.358
you borrowed his gun
and did it yourself, right?

01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:09.694
And when you heard Thursby was shot,
you knew Gutman was in town.

01:34:09.766 --> 01:34:11.358
And you knew you needed
another protector,

01:34:11.434 --> 01:34:14.801
somebody to fill Thursby's boots,
so you came back to me.

01:34:14.871 --> 01:34:17.931
Yes! Sweetheart, it wasn't only that.

01:34:18.441 --> 01:34:20.671
I'd have come back to you, sooner or later.

01:34:20.743 --> 01:34:23.576
From the very first instant I saw you,
I knew.

01:34:25.481 --> 01:34:30.043
Well, if you get a good break,
you'll be out of Tehachapi in 20 years,

01:34:30.119 --> 01:34:32.314
and you can come back to me then.

01:34:32.722 --> 01:34:36.180
I hope they don't hang you, precious,
by that sweet neck.

01:34:38.628 --> 01:34:41.563
- You're not...
- Yes, angel, I'm gonna send you over.

01:34:41.631 --> 01:34:43.997
The chances are you'll get off with life.

01:34:44.067 --> 01:34:46.627
That means, if you're a good girl,
you'll be out in 20 years.

01:34:46.703 --> 01:34:48.398
I'll be waiting for you.

01:34:48.471 --> 01:34:51.065
If they hang you,
I'll always remember you.

01:34:53.743 --> 01:34:55.108
Don't, Sam.

01:34:55.578 --> 01:34:57.603
Don't say that, even in fun.

01:34:59.082 --> 01:35:02.347
I was frightened for a minute.
I really thought...

01:35:02.852 --> 01:35:05.320
You do such wild
and unpredictable things.

01:35:05.388 --> 01:35:07.117
Now, don't be silly.

01:35:07.223 --> 01:35:09.088
You're taking the fall.

01:35:15.031 --> 01:35:16.965
You've been playing with me,

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.264
just pretending you cared
to trap me like this.

01:35:20.336 --> 01:35:22.201
You didn't care at all!

01:35:22.972 --> 01:35:24.462
You don't love me!

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.405
I won't play the sap for you.

01:35:26.509 --> 01:35:28.067
You know it's not like that.
You can't say that.

01:35:28.144 --> 01:35:30.169
You never played square with me
for half an hour at a stretch

01:35:30.216 --> 01:35:31.235
since I've known you.

01:35:31.347 --> 01:35:34.874
You know down deep in your heart that
in spite of anything I've done, I love you.

01:35:34.951 --> 01:35:37.044
I don't care who loves who!
I won't play the sap for you!

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.578
I won't walk in Thursby's and I don't know
how many others' footsteps!

01:35:40.657 --> 01:35:43.649
You killed Miles,
and you're going over for it.

01:35:56.539 --> 01:35:58.803
How can you do this to me, Sam?

01:36:00.076 --> 01:36:03.045
Surely Mr. Archer wasn't
as much to you as...

01:36:15.792 --> 01:36:17.020
Listen.

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.828
This won't do any good.

01:36:20.596 --> 01:36:24.054
You'll never understand me,
but I'll try once and then give it up.

01:36:24.133 --> 01:36:27.398
When a man's partner is killed,
he's supposed to do something about it.

01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:29.700
It doesn't make any difference
what you thought of him.

01:36:29.772 --> 01:36:33.299
He was your partner, and you're supposed
to do something about it,

01:36:33.743 --> 01:36:36.576
and it happens
we're in the detective business.

01:36:36.679 --> 01:36:39.807
Well, when one of your organization
gets killed, it's...

01:36:40.183 --> 01:36:43.311
It's bad business
to let the killer get away with it,

01:36:43.386 --> 01:36:46.014
bad all around,
bad for every detective everywhere.

01:36:46.089 --> 01:36:48.421
You don't expect me to think
that these things you're saying

01:36:48.491 --> 01:36:49.958
are sufficient reason for sending me...

01:36:50.026 --> 01:36:52.551
Wait till I'm through. Then you can talk.

01:36:52.628 --> 01:36:54.823
I've no earthly reason to think
I can trust you,

01:36:54.897 --> 01:36:57.889
and if I do this and get away with it,
you'll have something on me

01:36:57.967 --> 01:37:00.197
that you can use whenever you want to.

01:37:00.269 --> 01:37:01.759
Since I've got something on you,

01:37:01.838 --> 01:37:05.399
I couldn't be sure that you wouldn't
put a hole in me someday.

01:37:06.008 --> 01:37:07.942
All those are on one side.

01:37:08.177 --> 01:37:11.738
Maybe some of them are unimportant.
I won't argue about that.

01:37:12.348 --> 01:37:14.543
But look at the number of them.

01:37:15.451 --> 01:37:17.282
And what have we got on the other side?

01:37:17.353 --> 01:37:21.585
All we've got is that maybe you love me
and maybe I love you.

01:37:22.792 --> 01:37:25.192
You know whether you love me or not.

01:37:26.929 --> 01:37:31.491
Maybe I do. I'll have some rotten nights
after I've sent you over, but that'll pass.

01:37:36.506 --> 01:37:38.701
And if all I've said
doesn't mean anything to you,

01:37:38.775 --> 01:37:41.403
then forget it and we'll make it just this,

01:37:41.477 --> 01:37:45.038
I won't because all of me wants to
regardless of consequences,

01:37:45.281 --> 01:37:46.976
and because you've counted on that
with me

01:37:47.049 --> 01:37:49.540
the same as you counted on that
with all the others.

01:37:49.619 --> 01:37:53.055
Would you've done this to me if the Falcon
had been real and you'd got your money?

01:37:53.122 --> 01:37:55.784
Don't be too sure I'm as crooked
as I'm supposed to be.

01:37:55.858 --> 01:37:58.292
That sort of reputation
might be good business,

01:37:58.361 --> 01:38:02.422
bringing high-priced jobs and making it
easier to deal with the enemy,

01:38:02.865 --> 01:38:07.700
but a lot more money would have been
one more item on your side of the scales.

01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:11.706
If you'd loved me, you wouldn't have
needed any more on that side.

01:38:23.386 --> 01:38:24.580
Come in.

01:38:29.325 --> 01:38:31.225
Hello, Tom. Got them?

01:38:31.294 --> 01:38:32.386
Got them.

01:38:32.462 --> 01:38:35.989
Swell. Here's another one for you.
She killed Miles.

01:38:36.666 --> 01:38:40.158
And I've got some exhibits,
the boys' guns, one of Cairo's,

01:38:40.236 --> 01:38:43.069
and a $1,000 bill I was supposed
to be bribed with,

01:38:43.372 --> 01:38:46.739
and this black statuette here
that all the fuss was about.

01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:48.977
What's the matter
with your little playmate?

01:38:49.045 --> 01:38:50.444
He looks brokenhearted.

01:38:50.513 --> 01:38:53.004
And I bet when he heard Gutman's story,
he thought he had me.

01:38:53.082 --> 01:38:54.640
Cut it out, Sam.

01:38:55.885 --> 01:38:58.513
Well, shall we be getting down to the hall?

01:39:09.866 --> 01:39:11.231
It's heavy.

01:39:11.634 --> 01:39:12.965
What is it?

01:39:17.306 --> 01:39:20.867
The stuff that dreams are made of.

01:39:21.305 --> 01:39:27.213
