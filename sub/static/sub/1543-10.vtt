WEBVTT

00:06.373 --> 00:07.511
Where's my brother?

00:09.910 --> 00:11.685
- What are you?
- I'm a demon.

00:13.413 --> 00:14.858
Wow.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.829
Everybody.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.904
You owe me.

00:36.336 --> 00:37.406
So do we have a deal?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.128
You killed my dad.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.198
- Ugh.
Mother?

01:03.230 --> 01:04.300
I'll get out.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.539
Give me the girl.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.224
Tell me you had to do this.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.598
Son?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.433
Son?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.372
Fergus.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.838
What's the matter?

02:16.870 --> 02:18.713
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

02:18.939 --> 02:21.351
You're soaked in the horror sweat.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.646
Haven't seen that since the plague years.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.721
Darling, what can I do'?

02:26.213 --> 02:29.023
Not a thing, you evil bitch.

02:29.216 --> 02:32.220
"Not a thing, you evil bitch" mother.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.395
Let's not get too cozy just yet.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.538
She barely speaks to me.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.910
She's like a wounded animal.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.679
Just watching me.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.753
Look, Cass, you know what?

03:33.447 --> 03:36.917
You really tried to do the right
thing that night. You did.

03:37.117 --> 03:41.588
This guy Claire was hanging out with,
Randy, all he did was use her.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.792
Yeah, well, she thought he was kind.
And for that, she loved him.

03:45.892 --> 03:49.066
Shows how little kindness there was
in her life.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.266
You know, whatever Randy did,
he didn't deserve...

03:52.466 --> 03:55.413
No, yeah, I know, I know. I hear you.

03:55.969 --> 03:59.280
Dean has had to kill before. We both have.

03:59.473 --> 04:03.080
But that was...

04:03.276 --> 04:05.051
That was what?

04:08.381 --> 04:10.088
- Dean.
- That was a massacre.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.092
That's what it was.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.630
That there was a time I was a hunter,
not a stone-cold killer?

04:22.829 --> 04:25.673
You can say it. You're not wrong.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.646
I crossed the line.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.751
Guys, this thing has gotta go.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.250
- That won't be easy.
- Well, then, burn it off.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.953
- Cut it off.
- It is more than a physical thing.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.527
It will take a powerful force
to remove the effect.

04:44.684 --> 04:48.029
Dean, we have been through all the lore.
There's nothing.

04:49.523 --> 04:53.630
This reaches back to the time of creation.
It may pre-date the lore.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.467
If we had the demon tablet, maybe.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.943
- But you said it was missing.
- It is.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.680
There may be another way.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.685
Ah, may I help you?

05:46.313 --> 05:49.920
His Majesty didn't want you
wandering around unattended.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.390
Certainly not in here.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.991
And I was just looking
for a wee scrap of food.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.396
That swill they bring me,
hardly fit for the mother of the king.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.504
I wouldn't know. I don't eat.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.264
If you please, I have my orders.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.410
Oh, you poor dear man.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.242
Guthrie, is it?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.909
Terrified of displeasing him, aren't you?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.415
I know how my son can be.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.020
You're all scared spitless.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.015
Still, a boy listens to his mom.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.215
I'd be happy to put in a good word for you.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.122
I'm fine, thank you.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.795
Guthrie.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.523
Whatever this is, it bores me rigid.
Do I sign or not'?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.862
I found it in order, sir. Do sign.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.064
Mommy.

06:37.264 --> 06:40.438
Bored? Suicidal? Both?

06:40.634 --> 06:43.444
Hardly, my dear. I'm learning so much.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.446
This place of yours?

06:45.639 --> 06:49.143
Poor thing.
I see now why you are the way you are.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.146
My goodness.

06:52.312 --> 06:55.156
The discontent, the gossip, the plotting.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.917
- Plotting?
- Aye.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.154
And that one, worst of the lot.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.433
Watch yourself around him, mark my word.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.795
You do realize that's exactly what you said
about the guard, Gerald, down in the cells.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.097
And was I not right?

07:09.663 --> 07:13.839
I know, I know, you mistrust me,
and I earned that, and it's a pity...

07:14.067 --> 07:18.277
...because more than any
of your other subjects, I wish you success.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.749
I know what you're up to here, mother.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.344
Do you, dean'?

07:24.511 --> 07:27.321
You are shamelessly sucking up
so that I'll free you...

07:27.514 --> 07:31.291
...so you can run amok
and gum up my operation once again.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.430
- No, thank you.
- Flee-schmee.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.328
Why would I want to be free
when I can be here with my son?

07:36.923 --> 07:40.598
Does it hurt that you are the king
and there are advantages for me in that?

07:40.794 --> 07:44.332
No. But more important, I'm a mother.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.306
Sue me, I'm proud.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.202
Excuse me if I don't curl up on your lap.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.316
You did manage stay away for 300 years.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.882
Please. We've been over this.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.045
The locals were going to try me for witchcraft
and that never ends well. I had to flee.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.450
You could've sent for me.

07:59.646 --> 08:04.527
Well, then came the chance to study under the
great Milanese witch, Leticia D'albioni.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.858
And then there was unpleasantness
with the grand coven.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.795
It was no environment for a child.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.301
So locking me away in a squalid workhouse
was your solution?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.871
I will not apologize
for being a career woman.

08:17.964 --> 08:23.004
Besides, what's 300 years,
more or less, to folks like us'?

08:23.403 --> 08:24.746
Nothing.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.077
I'm back now.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.048
We can be a family.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.691
They should be here by now.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.366
Was there word of a delay?

08:43.323 --> 08:45.564
All I do is watch the door.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.768
Who are you expecting, Castiel?

09:08.715 --> 09:09.955
Thank you, Ingrid.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.129
I did as you asked at great risk, Castiel.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.387
I know.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.089
I approached you
because I know you share my belief...

09:16.256 --> 09:18.566
...that it is angels' mission
to protect humans.

09:18.792 --> 09:22.968
It's possible I can eliminate a great
threat to them, but I will need his help.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.311
He must be returned intact. Is that clear?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.070
Yes.

09:35.975 --> 09:38.581
Told you last time I saw you
I'd get out of the slammer.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.883
It's temporary. Trust me.

09:42.048 --> 09:45.222
Well, speaking of temporary,
you must've borrowed some more grace.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.489
You're looking very good.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.223
Of course, we both know that won't last.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.767
Is that why I'm here?
You think I'm gonna help you?

09:52.959 --> 09:54.939
- This isn't about me.
- Of course not.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.837
The great Castiel never stoops
to such selfishness.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.839
So, what is it, then?

10:04.170 --> 10:07.014
Oh, I see.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.743
I'm betting you didn't
tell Ingrid about him.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.978
Hello, Sam.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.926
Here to kill me?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.092
Lovely room.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.499
It's where you bring the kinky chicks,
am I right'!

10:23.690 --> 10:25.863
I'll ask the questions here.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.366
You.

10:27.527 --> 10:31.600
Your only job is to provide information.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.268
Well, information does happen
to be a specialty.

10:36.035 --> 10:39.642
Got about 2 billion fun facts up here.

10:39.873 --> 10:45.186
Of course, whether I choose to cough one up
or not is another matter.

10:45.445 --> 10:49.120
We need to know how to remove
the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.

10:50.116 --> 10:51.561
What?

10:51.784 --> 10:52.888
He's back?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.293
Because of the Mark?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.461
So...

10:59.893 --> 11:00.894
...he's a demon.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.465
No.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.001
Okay, what, then?

11:08.835 --> 11:12.146
What, did he "kill a human" or something?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.912
He's gone nuclear.

11:17.977 --> 11:22.756
Total, foaming-at-the-mouth,
balls out maniac.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.423
That's fantastic.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.996
Do you know how to remove it?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.929
Maybe.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.098
But here's the thing.

11:32.759 --> 11:38.539
You expect any help out of me, you keep that
crazy brother of yours on a short leash.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.767
Buddy...

11:41.334 --> 11:44.713
...I don't care what happens to you.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.745
You killed my brother.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.376
I was hoping to be gone
by the time you got back.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.216
If you don't like the room,
we can find another one.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.949
It's not the room, Castiel.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.218
It's you.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.095
This isn't going to work.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.633
I mean, come on. You look like my father.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.471
It is his body. But he's dead.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.163
And I get it, you feel bad, but you...

12:44.063 --> 12:46.600
...whoever you are, are nothing to me.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.844
Claire, that's not true.

12:49.068 --> 12:53.448
I am in large part responsible
for the way your life has unfolded.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.480
I have a responsibility to help you.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.348
No, you don't.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.147
Claire.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.791
You have seen things, you've been through
things that no one your age should have.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.159
And you are adrift.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.662
I wanna help you have a life.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.028
I have a life.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.496
I'm good with it.

13:13.092 --> 13:17.268
If what you mean is a normal life,
well, that ship has sailed.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.637
Doesn't have to be the case.
You're still young.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.869
Stop talking to me like you're my father.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.013
You killed my father.

13:26.339 --> 13:30.310
And that friend of yours killed the
last thing I had closest to family.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.623
Are you speaking of Randy? Family?

13:34.280 --> 13:38.228
A man had you in that room
and Randy didn't make a move to help you.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.226
Maybe because he was at gunpoint.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.460
Dean Winchester is a monster.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.539
It's possible there is a little monster
in all of us.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.002
You want me to trust you...

13:50.196 --> 13:54.338
...and the fact that you'd even try to
defend him just proves to me that I can't.

13:54.734 --> 13:58.705
- Claire...
- No, Castiel, I'm done.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.977
I have to be on my own.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.351
Ain't life a bitch?

14:07.246 --> 14:10.318
Nebbishy little guy, me...

14:10.516 --> 14:13.929
...always sticking it
to the lunkhead jocks.

14:14.153 --> 14:16.497
You know what?
Screw the Mark, let's just kill him.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.760
Boy, he really is a mess.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.438
Who knew the Mark was so toxic?

14:23.429 --> 14:26.672
Well, actually, I did.

14:29.168 --> 14:32.741
You know it is going to own you
sooner than later.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.674
Yes, so how do we get rid of it?

14:35.541 --> 14:37.521
What, just like that? Social hour's oven'?

14:37.677 --> 14:40.089
Yes, and now we're moving on
to our keynote speaker.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.917
Which is you.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.755
With us asking the questions.

14:44.951 --> 14:49.866
And me taking the personal pleasure
of carving the answers out of you.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.535
Just... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.567
Hold on there, badass.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.742
Lighten up. Why do you just assume
I'm not gonna be helpful?

14:58.931 --> 15:02.140
- Because you're a dickwad.
- But I'm your dickwad.

15:03.636 --> 15:08.642
I have a special place
in my non-heart for you both.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.151
To which end, ta-da.

15:12.612 --> 15:16.458
I would be tickled
to help you pop this biblical zit.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.726
To do it,
you are gonna need one specific thing.

15:24.957 --> 15:29.770
Your old bud, the First Blade.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.577
What?

15:36.502 --> 15:38.106
As I said...

15:38.571 --> 15:40.676
...ain't life a bitch?

15:40.907 --> 15:43.285
This is the single
worst idea I've ever heard.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.685
You just whacked people, and that's
when the Blade was nowhere around.

15:46.913 --> 15:49.587
- Now you wanna be in contact with it?
- We don't know that.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.662
- All we know is we need it.
- All we know is he says we need it.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.492
- We don't know what he wants us to do.
- A step at a time.

15:55.688 --> 16:00.296
We play it safe, we learn what the spell is, how
it works and keep the Blade out of my hands.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.201
Are you sure this isn't the Mark
making you want the thing?

16:03.362 --> 16:06.536
- Why would we trust anything Metatron says?
- I don't trust Metatron.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.302
Then what?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.947
What's his game if he is lying, okay?

16:11.137 --> 16:14.710
The Blade without me is useless.
The Blade with me is trouble for him.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.477
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.781
But if we weren't willing to take a shot,
what was the point of bringing him here?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.219
Unless you got a better idea.

16:23.649 --> 16:28.496
Of course you recall the lovely lullaby I
sang to you nightly after you fed the goat.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.326
You never sung me a lullaby.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.969
You dosed me with whiskey
until I passed out.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.239
Even then, I had a touch for pharmacology.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.873
Your mom was a prodigy.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.472
Funny. Not what I called you.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.810
Business.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.585
Squirrel. It's been a while.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.249
Back to your former self?

16:51.477 --> 16:53.548
Crowley, we need to meet ASAP.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.325
Where?

16:57.984 --> 16:59.861
I got to go.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.760
Urgent. Matter of State.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.366
My son.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.696
So important.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.933
Shall I wait dinner for you?

17:09.161 --> 17:11.505
You don't cook, I don't eat.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.938
It's a perfect arrangement.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.511
Not even a goodbye.

17:45.364 --> 17:49.278
After my mom split and went crazy,
Randy was like a father to me.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.375
First, I lose my first dad.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.141
Now, I lose my second.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.149
And who killed him and trashed my life?

17:56.976 --> 18:00.446
The buddy of the guy who killed my first
dad and wants to be my third dad.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.958
Heh. Wow, sounds just like my life.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.820
Complications and pain.
That's all family get you.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.160
Yes.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.733
That's why me and Tony keep moving.
No strings.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.236
Hey, why don't you hang with us for a while
and unload this whole mess?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.340
You might wanna reconsider.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.805
People near me get pretty unlucky
pretty fast.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.772
Oh, my... That's him again.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.177
The guy who killed your second dad
or the guy who killed your first dad?

18:28.407 --> 18:29.442
The second thing.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.644
- Tell him to get lost.
- I did.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.491
He's a turn-the-other-cheek kind of guy.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.988
Hon.

18:36.182 --> 18:41.097
You seem real sweet,
but sweetness don't clean up messes.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.598
Yeah.

18:49.028 --> 18:52.601
- Really, Crowley? Radio silence?
- Say something.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.205
You want me to do what?

18:58.437 --> 19:02.180
- We need you to bring back...
- Bring back the Blade? I don't think so.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.224
- You don't have to give the thing to me.
- I should say not.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.160
No, no, just retrieve it
and hang onto it until we need it.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.398
You, Moose, you're the sane one.
You on board with this?

19:19.625 --> 19:24.802
Wings of Titania,
bear mine eyes aloft as I bid thee.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.757
Insane.

19:47.987 --> 19:51.935
You want me to procure the most dangerous
weapon on the planet for Dean Winchester...

19:52.158 --> 19:54.764
...the man who goes mental
every time he touches it.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.397
- I thought you wanna go for beer, catch a film.
- Look, if this plan works...

19:58.597 --> 20:01.271
it's not a plan. It's a death sentence
for me and my kind.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.241
If it works, it's better for you.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.177
When the Mark is gone,
the Blade can't operate.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.374
Win-win, huh? Win-win.

20:08.574 --> 20:09.848
Stop that.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.612
It can't operate. It's hidden.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.881
The Blade might be powered down,
but the Mark is not.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.253
I'm doing everything I can
to keep it together.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.794
You think the body count is high right now?
Wait till Hal takes over.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.932
We figure you stashed the Blade
somewhere...

20:22.121 --> 20:24.123
Damn right. It's in a crypt with my bones.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.063
All right, well?

20:27.126 --> 20:28.935
I hate Guam this time of year.

20:50.049 --> 20:53.758
And why is this imperial communiqué
coming through you?

20:53.986 --> 20:57.661
The king always deals with me
mano a mano.

20:57.823 --> 21:02.568
Well, the king, my son,
had pressing affairs...

21:02.762 --> 21:07.507
...and asked me, his mother. to
speak with you, his most trusted...

21:07.666 --> 21:08.736
...underling.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.615
He said, "Only Guthrie can
be trusted with this task."

21:14.507 --> 21:15.508
I don't know.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.344
It's not your place to know, just to obey.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.921
I did mention that as
His Majesty's mother...

21:21.413 --> 21:25.190
...I have an unerring sense of what
or who is best for my son, yes?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.029
Ad nauseam.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.528
You'll recall, it was I who exposed
the traitor Gerald.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.206
The one the king executed.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.809
Turns out not all demons are nice.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.374
And lam a tigress when it comes
to my bonny lad.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.780
What is this task the king requires?

21:52.878 --> 21:56.621
Your resume indicates you were
a Crossroads demon before your promotion.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.221
I was.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.326
Then you do travel...

22:03.556 --> 22:05.399
...is that not correct?

22:12.031 --> 22:14.739
The First Blade is back in play
and Crowley is getting it'?

22:14.967 --> 22:17.641
- I don't mean to be an alarmist, but...
- Well, you know us.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.681
When we screw ourselves
we like to go whole hog.

22:20.906 --> 22:24.251
This would be the Crowley
who let the Blade...

22:24.410 --> 22:26.549
...turn Dean into a demon.

22:27.646 --> 22:30.752
I don't have a choice.
I don't do this, I'm down the rabbit hole.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.827
Hear evil, see evil, do evil. The trifecta.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.760
Cass, look. Let us worry about this.

22:35.988 --> 22:39.094
- You've got enough on your plate with Claire.
- Claire is gone.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.264
Gone where?

22:41.427 --> 22:43.373
I don't know. I should have stopped her.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.942
But I am certain that she is destined
for more trouble and disappointment.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.941
She is so...

22:49.101 --> 22:51.581
...so full of rage.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.717
Listen, man, if I could
make it better I would.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.275
It's actually why I'm here.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.584
I was hoping you might reach out to her.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.454
- Me?
- Yes.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.688
I'm probably the last person
she would want to hear from.

23:05.851 --> 23:07.611
Thought there would be a connection.

23:08.454 --> 23:11.025
One extremely messed up human to another.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.397
You could explain why you murdered
her only friend.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.300
Oh, yeah. When you put it like that.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.398
All I know...

23:19.632 --> 23:21.475
...is she won't talk to me.

23:22.534 --> 23:23.808
I thought if she...

23:24.036 --> 23:27.313
...understood the kind of man Randy was
and the danger she was in...

23:27.473 --> 23:29.146
...she might...

23:32.878 --> 23:34.482
What the hell? Why not?

23:34.647 --> 23:36.649
Long shots seem to be the theme
around here.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.626
I'm gonna go make a sandwich.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.498
I'll text you her number.

23:43.656 --> 23:44.930
Okay.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.932
I like texting.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.496
Emoticons.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.271
He seems calm.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.846
Considering the effects of the Mark...

24:00.839 --> 24:02.648
...and Metatron in proximity.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.016
Too calm.

24:05.844 --> 24:08.757
I think he's worried
about what will happen if he pops a cork.

25:08.807 --> 25:10.309
Sciatica.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.580
I need a firm chair.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.984
So I see.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.151
I have it.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.423
This is my responsibility.
I will deliver it only to the king.

25:25.090 --> 25:29.095
You have demonstrated
unimpeachable loyalty, Guthrie.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.939
You, more than any...

25:31.163 --> 25:34.269
...deserve this reward
from a grateful monarch.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.115
Don't screw with me, sycophant.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.190
What in hell?

25:49.515 --> 25:52.519
Exactly. What in hell is going on in Hell?

25:54.019 --> 25:55.862
You said Guthrie was one of your best.

25:56.055 --> 26:00.197
Your most trusted and yet I found him
inciting unrest amongst the court.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.394
- That can't be true.
- Can't it?

26:02.628 --> 26:05.040
He said you were colluding
with someone called...

26:05.264 --> 26:07.266
...Winchester? Yes.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.640
And that you were going to fetch him...
What was it?

26:10.869 --> 26:12.143
The First Blade?

26:12.471 --> 26:13.973
Which could kill us all.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.644
He said he got it first
because you couldn't be trusted.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.648
Naturally, I confronted him...

26:20.879 --> 26:22.415
...and he attacked me.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.595
I had no choice.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.223
I had a vision...

26:28.420 --> 26:29.899
...of Guthrie...

26:30.089 --> 26:31.500
...attacking me.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.500
A prophecy.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.996
I am an interpreter of signs.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.104
- It's not possible.
- I know, Sonny...

26:43.902 --> 26:46.348
...and yet.
- How could he have known?

26:46.572 --> 26:48.848
Spies everywhere.

26:49.074 --> 26:50.951
I did try to warn you.

26:52.177 --> 26:53.588
Fergus.

26:53.812 --> 26:56.520
These Winchesters he mentioned.

26:56.748 --> 26:59.695
They're not the hunter Winchesters,
are they?

26:59.952 --> 27:02.762
Because they, too,
could be a great danger for us.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.698
I mean, today we got lucky
but tomorrow, who knows?

27:06.859 --> 27:09.772
Who is there left for you to trust?

27:14.766 --> 27:16.211
Oh, we loved living there.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.381
It was our dream house.

27:18.537 --> 27:21.211
Of course the family came home
from vacation.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.216
Screwed up everything.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.720
I just about peed myself when the wife
pulled that gun out of her purse.

27:29.548 --> 27:33.860
We tore out of there and ran 2 miles,
bare-ass naked.

27:34.119 --> 27:37.191
Hey, it's Dean.
Look, Claire, we need to talk in person.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.960
Just tell me where, okay? Call me.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.398
That him again?

27:41.393 --> 27:43.168
Guy that caused you so much grief?

27:43.996 --> 27:45.236
Worse.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.068
Dean Winchester.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.810
The one who butchered Randy.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.503
And why?

27:50.736 --> 27:53.182
What was this Dean's connection
to Randy?

27:53.405 --> 27:54.816
He didn't even know him.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.487
Or the others. And he gutted them.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.246
And I saw him, standing there...

27:59.411 --> 28:01.652
...soaked in blood.
Looking like he enjoyed it.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.585
And now he wants to meet.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.752
- And talk.
- Maybe you should.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.199
- What?
- Me and Tony are worried for you.

28:11.823 --> 28:14.929
This guy around, you're always
gonna be looking over your shoulder.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.266
We've handled situations like this before.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.908
We could take care of him
so they won't bother you.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.839
Beat him up bad.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.945
Or...

28:25.437 --> 28:27.280
...something more permanent.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.802
- Yeah.
- Squirrel?

28:39.618 --> 28:40.619
I've got it.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.724
That's good to hear.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.065
Of course, I'm gonna hang onto to it...

28:45.290 --> 28:48.635
...until you work out
how to get that thing off your arm.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.311
I'm guessing you're not here to reminisce.

29:05.644 --> 29:08.488
All right, we did what you said.
We have the First Blade.

29:09.314 --> 29:12.488
Not here? Not on your person.

29:13.151 --> 29:16.496
Not saying. So back to you. What's next?

29:17.322 --> 29:19.324
This is where it gets kind of interesting.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.228
Uh-huh.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.169
It's very lonely here...

29:24.496 --> 29:27.238
...and I have little to do but think.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.340
And it occurred to me...

29:30.569 --> 29:34.608
...that you really need this Mark
taken off of you.

29:36.341 --> 29:38.252
And in order to do that...

29:39.177 --> 29:42.852
...you really need me.

29:44.082 --> 29:46.619
So here's the deal.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.362
That first little tip I gave you?

29:51.757 --> 29:53.600
A freebie.

29:53.859 --> 29:56.032
Just because you're you.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.873
Every future step...

30:02.934 --> 30:05.437
...they're gonna cost you.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.546
Big.

30:09.608 --> 30:13.283
Oh, and FYI, there's a bunch.

30:26.224 --> 30:27.897
What are you doing there, Slugger?

30:35.067 --> 30:37.980
I'm settling a score that's taken
way too long to settle.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.648
Oh, and while I do that,
I'm gonna get some information.

30:43.642 --> 30:47.749
And I'm gonna enjoy every minute of it.
Because you're gonna tell me everything.

30:48.814 --> 30:50.088
All of it.

30:50.248 --> 30:53.593
And it ain't gonna cost me a damn dime.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.564
Slugger.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.843
All right.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.342
I'm gonna ask this exactly once...

31:09.534 --> 31:11.775
...before it gets ugly.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.685
What is the next step in removing the Mark?

31:16.274 --> 31:21.622
I repeat my offer. Each step costs you.

31:22.781 --> 31:23.919
You're confused.

31:24.116 --> 31:28.462
See, each step you don't give me...

31:29.121 --> 31:31.362
...is gonna cost you.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.567
And it's been a long time coming.

31:37.929 --> 31:40.136
I mean, where do I begin?

31:41.700 --> 31:44.203
Stealing Cass' grace.

31:45.871 --> 31:48.477
Casting out the angels.

31:49.141 --> 31:52.987
Making Gadreel kill Kevin using
my brother's hands.

31:53.211 --> 31:55.157
Starting an angel war.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.486
And, oh, yeah...

32:00.385 --> 32:02.262
...you killed me.

32:04.156 --> 32:09.162
My morality is being judged
by Dean Winchester'?

32:09.795 --> 32:14.676
How many people have suffered and died
because they believed in you?

32:15.734 --> 32:20.183
How many times have you lied to Sam
including-J? Oh, by the way...

32:20.405 --> 32:23.579
...when he was possessed by an angel?

32:24.176 --> 32:26.816
And you say, "Oh, well,
it's all for the greater good."

32:27.012 --> 32:28.958
But lately, buddy?

32:29.181 --> 32:31.855
That greater good thing just went away,
didn't it?

32:32.083 --> 32:35.360
Now, people die just
because you want them to.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.469
Good, Dean. Go darker.

32:42.828 --> 32:43.932
Go deeper.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.878
Surely you've noticed,
every time you respond...

32:52.103 --> 32:54.709
...when the Mark gets you all twitchy.

32:55.373 --> 32:57.717
You fall deeper under its spell.

32:57.876 --> 33:02.154
You think roughing up a few humans
and demons makes it worse?

33:02.347 --> 33:07.626
Try messing with the scribe of God, Bucko.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.964
It's late.

33:15.393 --> 33:18.897
I'm gonna drive around a little bit.
See if I can find Claire.

33:19.130 --> 33:22.168
- Right now?
- I have to try.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.506
Well, be careful.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.141
Wait, Cass.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.747
Where's Dean?

33:39.818 --> 33:41.525
And Kevin's death?

33:41.753 --> 33:43.255
All on you.

33:43.488 --> 33:46.992
You put him in harm's way
and kept him there.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.932
Gadreel possessing Sam?

33:49.160 --> 33:51.868
Who was it who tricked Sam
into letting him in?

33:52.063 --> 33:54.543
Oh, and then my personal favorite..

33:54.766 --> 33:56.871
...Dean Winchester.

33:57.068 --> 34:01.539
Whose entire existence is defined by a war
on the dark and monstrous.

34:02.007 --> 34:06.615
Bromancing his way around the country
with the king of hell.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.789
Let's try this again.

34:12.951 --> 34:17.127
What is the next step?

34:17.621 --> 34:20.694
What is it you humans say so...

34:20.891 --> 34:22.871
...inelegantly?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.135
Oh, yes.

34:26.797 --> 34:28.436
Go screw yourself.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.149
- Dean?
- Now it's time to get serious.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.752
Dean!

34:42.547 --> 34:46.962
What is the next step in removing
this Mark from my arm?

34:47.719 --> 34:49.891
Dean, open the door.

34:50.221 --> 34:51.495
Hey, open the door.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.830
What is...

34:57.462 --> 34:58.907
...the next step?

35:09.341 --> 35:10.684
Move.

35:14.245 --> 35:15.690
Behold...

35:15.914 --> 35:18.861
...the river shall end at the source.

35:28.093 --> 35:30.937
No, Dean. Hey, stop. Stop.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.372
You were killing him.

35:38.603 --> 35:39.946
I have to take him back.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.277
- This won't happen again.
- I gave my word.

35:42.974 --> 35:47.013
I have fences to mend in Heaven
and as it is, I have a lot to explain.

35:47.212 --> 35:49.886
If you ever ask me for help again...

35:50.048 --> 35:51.789
...I will choose death.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.287
You realize, it's going to get worse, Dean.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.830
You're gonna get worse!

36:09.300 --> 36:10.335
Hey.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.075
You Okay?

36:17.809 --> 36:19.686
He said, "The river ends at the source."

36:20.478 --> 36:23.516
- What does it mean?
- Maybe nothing.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.663
It's the last thing he said
before you guys busted in.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.258
Dean.

36:32.157 --> 36:34.501
Look, man, we had to...

36:34.693 --> 36:37.003
Hey, no.

36:37.429 --> 36:40.171
I get n. All right? I...

36:42.600 --> 36:44.546
I was gonna kill him.

36:46.104 --> 36:48.448
And I couldn't stop myself.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.381
We'll figure it out, all right?

36:58.950 --> 37:03.558
Remember what Cass said
about needing a powerful force?

37:04.622 --> 37:07.296
- Yeah, so?
- So...

37:08.693 --> 37:11.196
I've been thinking. Look.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.541
Cain still has the Mark, right?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.270
And he's lived with it.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.415
For years, he's lived with it.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.208
So, yeah, the Mark...

37:21.406 --> 37:25.218
...is strong but...

37:26.277 --> 37:28.587
...Dean, maybe there's
a part of you that...

37:28.780 --> 37:30.782
...wants to give into it.

37:31.483 --> 37:34.930
And maybe you have to fight that.
You know, maybe...

37:35.220 --> 37:37.222
...part of that powerful force...

37:37.422 --> 37:38.992
...has to be you.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.901
- Yeah.
- It's Claire.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.105
I have thought it over.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.317
Maybe it's only fair to
hear your side of it.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.249
I mean...

37:58.443 --> 38:01.185
...Castiel seemed to trust you...

38:01.513 --> 38:02.651
...a lot.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.517
Yeah, okay. Where do you wanna meet?

39:07.512 --> 39:08.582
No.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.209
No.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.382
No, no.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.746
Claire.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.242
How the hell did you find me?

40:08.439 --> 40:11.443
- Angels are able to find those who pray to them.
- Pray?

40:12.043 --> 40:14.250
Believe me, I gave up praying
a long time ago.

40:14.445 --> 40:19.918
Well, it doesn't have to be a formal prayer.
I could pick up on a longing, or...

40:20.318 --> 40:22.298
Perhaps you wanted to tell me something?

40:22.820 --> 40:24.493
No.

40:26.624 --> 40:28.297
I don't know.

40:28.493 --> 40:29.938
Maybe.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.674
I guess I just...

40:34.265 --> 40:38.270
...wanted to tell you that I,
I thought about what you said.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.818
I'm gonna try doing things
a little bit different.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.283
Let go of the little bit of monster in me.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.854
Well...

40:51.082 --> 40:53.653
...I could try to help you with that.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.022
I still gotta go it alone.

40:58.690 --> 40:59.930
But I could...

41:00.792 --> 41:02.499
...maybe call sometime?

41:04.262 --> 41:06.264
Now get out of here, would you?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.877
No one's gonna pick me up
with that butt-ugly car sitting there.

41:12.670 --> 41:13.842
I'll see you, Claire.

41:15.506 --> 41:16.644
Oh, hey.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.978
Not that you care but...

41:20.545 --> 41:22.218
...I like you better in a tie.
