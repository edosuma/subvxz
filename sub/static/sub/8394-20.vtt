06:53.860 --> 06:55.304
I'M EXCITED FOR
A LITTLE SPREADSHEET ACTION.

06:55.410 --> 06:56.820
- YEAH.

06:56.930 --> 06:59.307
SO THANKS FOR DRINKS

07:18.330 --> 07:19.536
IF I'M GONNA COOK.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.459
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE COOKING.
- IS THAT OKAY?

07:20.570 --> 07:21.229
- YEAH, OF--SURE, OKAY.

07:21.330 --> 07:24.299
- ALL RIGHT.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.914
GOOD.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.368
- BRO.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.684
LONG TIME, MAN.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.860
THOUGHT YOU WERE
NEVER COMING BACK.

07:40.970 --> 07:42.619
UM...OH.
[laughs]

07:42.730 --> 07:44.971
YEAH, SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF, MAN.

07:45.080 --> 07:45.523
I HAD PLANNED TO MOVE IT.

07:45.630 --> 07:50.215
BUT, YOU KNOW, UH, YEAH.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.422
YEAH, HERE.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.223
HERE, LET ME GRAB
THIS TOWEL FOR YOU.

07:53.330 --> 07:54.251
[laughing]
OH.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.258
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

07:56.370 --> 07:57.257
CASHEW BUTTER.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.019
UM, YEAH.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.122
JUST KIND OF AS A COMING BACK
PRESENT, YOU KNOW.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.061
I GOT SUPER HUNGRY
AFTER PRACTICE ONE DAY

08:05.170 --> 08:08.298
AND ATE SOME OF IT,
BUT MOST OF IT'S STILL THERE.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.480
HEY, MAN.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.171
I DON'T WANT TO PROJECT,
BUT I KIND OF FEEL

08:12.280 --> 08:13.656
LIKE I'M GETTING AN ANGRY VIBE.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.694
- OKAY, KEEP THAT STUFF
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE ROOM.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.688
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS!

08:17.800 --> 08:21.042
THIS IS MY SIDE, OKAY?

08:21.150 --> 08:22.697
DON'T BUY ME STUFF!

08:22.810 --> 08:24.528
THERE'S, LIKE, THREE WEEKS LEI-T.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.210
JUST STAY OVER THERE.

08:26.330 --> 08:29.675
[door slams]

08:29.780 --> 08:31.429
- SO SHE STARTED TELLING ME
ABOUT THE OTHER GUY,

08:31.540 --> 08:33.189
YOU KNOW,
HER FORMER FIANCE,

08:33.300 --> 08:35.404
AND HE'S ENGAGED.
- MM-HMM.

08:35.510 --> 08:39.196
- SHE ALREADY BROKE OFF
WITH THE TENANT DR. FEELGOOD,

08:39.310 --> 08:42.199
SO I GUESS I'M THINKING,
"WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?"

08:42.310 --> 08:44.369
- YOU'RE WONDERING WHY YOU
AND SARAH AREN'T TOGETHER?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.482
- YEAH, I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER,

08:46.590 --> 08:48.899
AND WE'RE GETTING ALONG.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.797
AND LAST TIME
WAS A TIMING THING.

08:51.910 --> 08:54.287
AND NOW EVERYTHING IS FREEAND CLEAR.

08:54.390 --> 08:55.732
- HMM.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.353
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THE BREAK-UP?

08:57.460 --> 09:00.702
- JUST A--JUST BAD TIMING,
THAT'S ALL.

09:00.810 --> 09:03.529
SHE WAS ENGAGED
AND WE HAD A THING.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.528
- MM-HMM.
- IT BROKE UP.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.676
AND THEN I HAD TO MOVE
TO MINNESOTA.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.714
- TO BE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
- YEAH.

09:09.820 --> 09:11.333
AND THAT BLEW UP,
SO I CAME BACK.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.547
- SO WHEN YOU MOVED TO MINNESOTA
TO BE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER,

09:15.650 --> 09:17.538
YOU HAD JUST STARTED YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH SARAH?

09:17.660 --> 09:20.174
DID YOU TALK TO HER
ABOUT THE MOVE?

09:20.280 --> 09:21.065
- YEAH.

09:21.180 --> 09:23.273
YEAH, I MEAN,
I TOLD HER ABOUT IT.

09:23.390 --> 09:27.906
- IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE MADE
A BIG DECISION FOR YOU,

09:28.010 --> 09:32.288
BREAKING UP WITH HER FIANCE,
AND THEN YOU LEI-T.

09:32.390 --> 09:33.357
- YEAH, BUT...

09:33.460 --> 09:36.941
I MEAN, SHE'S A MOM.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.779
- MM-HMM.
- SHE UNDERSTOOD.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.677
- DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD

09:40.780 --> 09:44.432
BUT SHE WAS STILL UPSET?

09:44.540 --> 09:46.474
- NO.

09:46.580 --> 09:49.617
NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.166
- IN OUR WORK HERE...

09:52.280 --> 09:54.657
YOU MAY START QUESTIONING
SOME THINGS

09:54.760 --> 09:57.376
THAT YOU PREVIOUSLY TOOK
AS TRUTHS.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.583
THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.146
I THINK YOU SHOULD
REACH OUT TO SARAH.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.979
I THINK YOU
SHOULD REACH OUT TO HER

10:04.080 --> 10:06.765
AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND
HER POINT OF VIEW.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.462
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME
PROGRESS IN THE RELATIONSHIP,

10:09.570 --> 10:14.291
MAYBE YOU OWE HER
AN APOLOGY FIRST.

10:16.470 --> 10:18.438
- I JUST--I WOULD LIKE YOUR
OPINION ON SOMETHING.

10:18.540 --> 10:22.260
- OKAY.
- OKAY. SO, UM...

10:23.580 --> 10:27.584
SAY YOU AND ADAM WEREN'T
TOGETHER FOR WHATEVER REASON.

10:27.690 --> 10:31.205
- IS HE DEAD?
- NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.412
- GAY?
- SURE.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.171
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.030
OKAY.
- HYPOTH ETICALLY.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.311
- HYPOTHETICALLY,
YOU'RE NOT TOGETHER.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.638
COULD YOU BE WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

10:41.740 --> 10:44.356
SEXUALLY,
I MEAN, BE WITH SOMEONE?

10:46.430 --> 10:51.299
- WELL, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE SAYING
HYPOTHETICALLY?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.606
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.369
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.129
- OKAY, RIGHT?
THAT'S NORMAL.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.332
- IT'S VERY NORMAL.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.580
I FEEL LIKE IF YOU'RE WITH
SOMEBODY FOR A LONG TIME,

11:00.690 --> 11:03.158
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT
WONDER WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

11:03.280 --> 11:04.304
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.557
- RIGHT.

11:05.660 --> 11:06.820
- I'M NOT SAYING
I EVER THOUGHT LIKE THAT.

11:06.940 --> 11:08.202
- [laughing]
SHUT UP.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.412
- YOU KNOW.
- OKAY.

11:09.530 --> 11:10.599
- IT'S GOOD.
- GOOD.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.042
OKAY, WELL,
'CAUSE I HAVE A DATE.

11:12.150 --> 11:13.594
- YOU HAVE A DATE? WITH WHO?

11:13.700 --> 11:15.975
- WELL...
- THAT'S AMAZING.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.217
- THANK YOU.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.321
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF AMAZING,
BUT I'M ALSO NERVOUS.

11:19.430 --> 11:20.351
- OKAY, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT JOEL?

11:20.470 --> 11:22.085
IS HE DATING? I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GUYS WERE THERE YET.

11:22.190 --> 11:23.179
- I DON'T THINK SO, I DON'T--
I KNOW.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.813
I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE
THERE YET, EITHER.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.080
BUT HE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR

11:26.200 --> 11:27.849
THAT HE THINKS WE SHOULD
BASICALLY BE MOVING ON.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.645
AND SO, WHO IT IS
IS THE ONLY PERSON

11:30.750 --> 11:32.308
THAT'S MADE ME HAPPY
THIS YEAR.

11:32.410 --> 11:33.923
IT'S ED, YOU KNOW.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.588
SO WHY AM I--
- IT'S ED.

11:35.690 --> 11:38.272
- 'CAUSE HE MAKES ME HAPPY.
- THAT'S ED.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.369
- YEAH.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.060
I'M JUST A TERRIBLE PERSON.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.659
- YOU'RE NOT A TERRIBLE PERSON.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.692
YOU'RE A LOVING, GIVING,
WONDERFUL WOMAN.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.552
YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.
- OKAY.

11:46.670 --> 11:47.625
- JUST--JUST BE
A LITTLE CAREFUL.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.004
THAT'S ALL, YOU KNOW?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:50.120 --> 11:52.588
- YOU DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING
THAT YOU MIGHT REGRET LATER.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.701
THAT'S ALL.
YOU'RE STILL MARRIED.

11:54.810 --> 11:55.424
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW THAT.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.940
- NO, EXACTLY.

11:58.060 --> 11:59.607
EXACTLY.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.780
- ED.

12:01.890 --> 12:04.472
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.613
- AHA!

12:10.730 --> 12:11.822
HERE WE GO.

12:11.930 --> 12:12.965
- HOME SWEET HOME!

12:13.070 --> 12:14.799
- I FORGOT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.619
I HAVE TO SEE MY ROOM.
- [laughs]

12:17.730 --> 12:19.004
- I FORGOT HOW MUCH
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

12:19.110 --> 12:21.214
- OUR OWN BEDROOM.
- YEAH.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.173
- OUR OWN BATHROOM.

12:22.290 --> 12:24.565
OUR OWN--WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED IN HERE?

12:24.670 --> 12:25.876
WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE FLOOR?

12:25.980 --> 12:28.801
- WELL, WE HAD TO RIP IT UP
TO GET TO THE MOLD.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.115
- WHAT? YOU DIDN'T THINK
YOU SHOULD CALL ME FIRST?

12:31.230 --> 12:32.948
YOU JUST--
- THEY TOLD ME TO GET THE MOLD.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.539
MOLD WAS UNDER THE FLOORBOARDS,
UNDER THE KITCHEN,

12:34.650 --> 12:35.958
AND THE TWO BEDROOMS
ON THE LEI-T.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.436
- YOU'RE SAYING THE BEDROOMS
LOOK LIKE THIS TOO?

12:37.540 --> 12:39.337
THAT'S WHAT YOU--YOU TORE UP--
- OKAY, WAIT--

12:39.440 --> 12:41.328
- YOU CAME IN HERE
AND TORE UP THE WHOLE HOUSE?

12:41.450 --> 12:42.894
- BABY, CALM DOWN FOR A SECOND.
- THAT'S HOW YOU DEALT WITH

12:43.000 --> 12:44.137
THE MOLD?
- WE COULDN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.275
- JUST LIGHT IT ON FIRE NEXT--
WHAT?

12:45.380 --> 12:46.278
- WE COULDN'T LIVE LIKE
THIS ANYWAY.

12:46.380 --> 12:47.199
I MEAN, IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR THE BABY.

12:47.310 --> 12:49.346
- YEAH, THEY'RE
REALLY SUSCEPTIBLE.

12:49.450 --> 12:50.439
- OH, YOU'RE A DOCTOR NOW.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.629
- HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE?
- PROBABLY A WEEK.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.210
MAYBE LONGER.
- AND HOW MUCH?

12:54.320 --> 12:56.481
WHAT'S THIS GONNA SET US BACK?
- WELL I'M NOT A FLOOR GUY SO...

12:56.600 --> 13:00.115
- OH. OKAY, BALLPARK IT.
THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.279
- BUT I'D ESTIMATE
AROUND 12 GRAND.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.732
- TW--$12,000?

13:04.850 --> 13:06.363
THAT'S YOUR ESTIMATION?

13:06.470 --> 13:07.744
AI-TER EVERYTHING I ALREADY SPENT
ON THE MOLD REMOVAL?

13:07.850 --> 13:11.263
$12,000 TO GET MY FAMILY BACK
IN THE HOUSE?

13:11.370 --> 13:13.292
- GIVE OR TAKE.

13:13.410 --> 13:14.331
COULD BE MORE.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.886
- "COULD BE MORE."

13:17.000 --> 13:18.137
[doorbell rings]
- OH.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.582
- DOORBELL.
- NO, NO, I GOT IT.

13:19.690 --> 13:21.920
STAY PUT, MAX.
- DOORBELL.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.792
- I KNOW.
[doorbell rings]

13:23.900 --> 13:26.767
- IT'S HELPING ME
MORE THAN IT'S HELPING YOU.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.349
- NO, WELL,
THAT'S NICE TO HEAR.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.451
THIS IS MR. KNIGHT.
- THE GANG IS ALL HERE.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.562
- MAX, MY MAN.

13:32.670 --> 13:33.739
WE'VE BEEN MISSING YOU
AT SCHOOL.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.761
- I DON'T MISS YOU.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.280
- OKAY, THERE HE IS.
- THAT'S SWEET.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.606
- THERE HE IS.
- WHAT A CHARMER.

13:38.710 --> 13:39.608
- SAME GUY.
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.769
PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE.

13:41.890 --> 13:42.777
- OH, YEAH.
- OH, PARENTS.

13:42.890 --> 13:43.914
- THOSE PARENTS.
- THE WORST.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.783
- HI, EVAN KNIGHT.
YOU MUST BE

13:46.890 --> 13:49.643
THE SCARY LAWYER SISTER.
- I AM JULIA.

13:49.750 --> 13:50.819
- I DIDN'T SAY SCARY.
- GOD, IT'S NICE

13:50.930 --> 13:53.376
TO HEAR SOMEONE SAY THAT,
THOUGH--IT IS.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.959
- I SAID A GOOD LAWYER,
NOT A SCARY LAWYER.

13:55.070 --> 13:56.992
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

13:57.110 --> 14:00.762
SO BOTTOM LINE IS YOUR PETITION
IS IN FANTASTIC SHAPE.

14:00.870 --> 14:03.589
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE
AN AMAZING JOB.

14:03.700 --> 14:04.860
- THANK YOU.
- AWESOME.

14:04.980 --> 14:06.311

14:06.430 --> 14:10.469

ON THE SCHOOL BOARD MEETING

14:10.570 --> 14:11.537
FOR THURSDAY.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.356
WE'RE ON THE AGENDA.

14:12.470 --> 14:13.778

- IT'S HAPPENING, YES.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.324
- THIS THURSDAY?

14:15.440 --> 14:16.702
- THAT'S GREAT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:16.820 --> 14:17.775
- WE GOTTA GET IT TOGETHER.
- IT TOOK A BIT OF WRANGLING,

14:17.890 --> 14:19.334
BUT I WORE THEM DOWN.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.475
SO FIRST THINGS FIRST,
WE ALL NEED TO BE THERE.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.957

WE'LL BE THERE.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.755

OKAY, GOOD.
SO WE HAVE A FEW DAYS.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.198
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I THINK WE CAN DO

14:32.310 --> 14:33.345
TO MAKE THIS THING UNDENIABLE.

14:33.450 --> 14:35.031
I'VE GIVEN YOU ALL
OF YOUR TASKS.

14:35.150 --> 14:35.764
I MAY HAVE GONE
A LITTLE BIT OVERBOARD.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.838
- NO, NEVER.
- NO, NO.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.009
- NOT YOU!
- I LIKE THIS.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.213
YOU'RE DEFINII-IA'TJTY A LAWYER.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.708
AND YOU, WHAT EXACTLY
IS YOUR AFFILIATION

14:43.810 --> 14:44.777
WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOL?

14:44.880 --> 14:47.041
IS IT HEADMASTER?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.673
- WELL, WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT
EXACTLY, WHAT THE--

14:48.780 --> 14:50.771
SOME CAPACITY.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.811
- PLEASE.
- GOOD.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.569
- WE'RE HOPING.
- OKAY.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.988
THAT'S GOOD FOR NOW.

14:55.100 --> 14:55.816
SO YOU'LL SEE
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO

14:55.920 --> 14:58.263
WITH THE CURRICULUM DESCRIPTION.

14:58.380 --> 14:59.813
IT'S GREAT, BUT I THINK WE NEED
MORE THAN JUST BULLET POINTS.

14:59.930 --> 15:00.851
- OKAY.
- SO JUST A PAGE

15:00.960 --> 15:03.201
ON BASICALLY
YOUR TEACHING PHILOSOPHY,

15:03.310 --> 15:05.039
ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS
TO LEARNING DIFFERENCES.

15:05.140 --> 15:06.823
- YEAH.
- AND MAKE IT FLOWERY.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.659
TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS.
YOU KNOW, GO FOR IT.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.032
- FLOWERY?
- YEAH.

15:11.150 --> 15:12.697
- YOU WANT--YEAH, OKAY.
I CAN DO FLOWERY.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.767
- [laughs]
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

15:13.870 --> 15:16.077
- NO PROBLEM.

15:16.190 --> 15:16.872
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA RUN,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.902
- OKAY, YEAH.
- I HAVE TO DO

15:19.020 --> 15:20.590
SOME MORE RESEARCH
ON THE ENABLING STATUTE

15:20.710 --> 15:22.701
BEFORE I PICK UP THE KIDS.
- OKAY, THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

15:22.810 --> 15:24.152
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- OF COURSE.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.431
- IT WILL BE FUN, TOO.

15:25.540 --> 15:26.609
- YEAH.
- LOVE YOU.

15:26.710 --> 15:29.361
- REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE MEETING YOU.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.573
- LOOK FORWARD TO--
TO WORKING ON THIS.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.854
- YES, AND THURSDAY
IS COMING UP QUICKLY.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.166
- HIT 'EM WITH THE CITIES.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.759
- YEP, THEN WE GOT PORTLAND,
HARTFORD, BOSTON,

15:37.860 --> 15:40.237
AND YOU FINISH UP
WITH THREE NIGHTS

15:40.350 --> 15:41.248
AT THE BEACON THEATRE
IN NEW YORK CITY.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.511
- WOW, THAT'S A GREAT VENUE.
- YEAH.

15:43.630 --> 15:45.143
YEAH, I SAW NEIL YOUNG THERE
IN '91.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.319
HARVEST MOON.
IT WAS AWESOME.

15:46.420 --> 15:49.071
AND YOU GET TO SELL YOUR ALBUMS
AT EVERY...

15:49.180 --> 15:50.283
EVERY SPOT, GUYS.

15:50.390 --> 15:52.358
- YOU'LL HAVE TOUR FEES, MERCH.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.519
I MEAN, IT COULD ADD UP
A PRETTY GOOD NUMBER.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.460
IN FACT...
- YEP. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

15:56.570 --> 15:58.185
THOSE ARE THE FIGURES
RIGHT THERE.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.534
- OKAY, DON'T GET EXCITED,
ALL RIGHT?

16:02.650 --> 16:04.709
AM I GONNA BE THE ONLY ONE
TO ADDRESS THIS BIG ELEPHANT

16:04.820 --> 16:05.741
IN THE ROOM?

16:05.860 --> 16:08.237
- WHICH IS?

16:08.340 --> 16:11.821
- WHICH IS FOUR LITTLE
DOUCHE BAGS WITH SKINNY TIES,

16:11.930 --> 16:14.103
COCKER SPANIEL HAIRCUTS.
WE'RE NOT OPENING

16:14.210 --> 16:16.098
FOR A 12-YEAR-OLD
NAMED CHAD LOVE!

16:16.210 --> 16:17.893
- YOUR NAME IS OLIVER ROME.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.386
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING TO
MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU COULD HAVE

16:19.490 --> 16:21.936
EVER POSSIBLY PLAYED TO
ON YOUR OWN, AND YOU'RE UPSET.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.211
- SO THESE ARE ALL SEATED SHOWS,
RIGHT?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.662
- YEAH. RIGHT.
- BUTTS IN SEATS.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.943
THAT MEANS THEY ONLY SHOW UP
FOR THE HEADLINER.

16:28.050 --> 16:30.018
SO HERE WE ARE,
A BUNCH OF TOOLBOXES

16:30.120 --> 16:31.872
PLAYING TO AN EMPTY,
GIANT ROOM,

16:31.990 --> 16:34.254
WITH MAYBE A COUPLE
FAN CLUB KIDS GOING,

16:34.370 --> 16:35.883
"WHO ARE THESE GUYS?
I DON'T CARE."

16:35.990 --> 16:38.197
- YEAH, MAKING MORE MONEY THAN
YOU'VE EVER MADE IN YOUR LIFE.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.097
I TELL YOU ONE THING--
- I DON'T WANT TO SACRIFICE

16:40.200 --> 16:42.065
ANY SORT OF ARTISTIC CREDIBILITY

16:42.170 --> 16:44.616
THAT WE EVEN HAVE RIGHT NOW,
WHICH IS VERY SMALL,

16:44.720 --> 16:47.826
JUST TO SAIL IT AWAY
ON A BIG SHIP MADE OUT OF MONEY.

16:47.930 --> 16:49.204
- HEY! ARCADE FIRE:
THEY DIDN'T CALL.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.379
RADIOHEAD: THEY'RE NOT CALLING!

16:50.490 --> 16:51.752
HERE'S YOUR OPTION,
AND IT'S A DAMN GOOD ONE.

16:51.870 --> 16:54.725
- THIS IS YOUR BIG MONEY COW
THAT YOU GUYS WANT TO TAKE IN

16:54.840 --> 16:56.284
AND JUST PRAISE?

16:56.390 --> 16:58.142
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
THE DOUGH FOR YOU.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.353
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS TOUR.
- HEY, OLIVER, STOP.

16:59.460 --> 17:00.904
LISTEN, WE ARE DOING THIS TOUR.
- IT'S OURS.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.251
- GUYS, WE'RE DOING THIS TOUR,
RIGHT?

17:04.980 --> 17:07.084
[beeping, click]

17:07.190 --> 17:09.670
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.362
HOW'S THAT?

17:12.470 --> 17:13.744
- THAT'S GOOD.

17:13.860 --> 17:15.543
- YOU THINK?
- COUPLE WIDES.

17:15.650 --> 17:17.686
- YOU DON'T THINK IT'S TOO DARK?
- NO, NO.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.371
THAT'LL COME OUT GOOD.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.822
- MM. MM.

17:20.930 --> 17:22.795
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
- HMM?

17:22.900 --> 17:25.516
- I DON'T OWE YOU AN APOLOGY
OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

17:25.630 --> 17:28.724
- [scoffs]
FOR WHAT?

17:28.840 --> 17:29.966
- YEAH.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.139
NO, I MEAN, EXACTLY.
RIGHT.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.729
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME,
RIGHT?

17:33.840 --> 17:35.637
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHOULD I BE?

17:35.740 --> 17:38.015
- ALL RIGHT.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.223
YESTERDAY, I WAS TALKING
TO DR. PELIKAN,

17:39.330 --> 17:41.981
AND HE SAID THAT HE THINKS
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY

17:42.090 --> 17:43.978
FOR WHEN I WENT TO MINNESOTA.

17:44.090 --> 17:47.742
[radio playing
in background]

17:47.850 --> 17:48.987
- HMM.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.955
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:52.070 --> 17:54.209
- LOOK, UH...

17:54.310 --> 17:56.369
DO YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY?
I DON'T KNOW.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.860
BUT I WAS DEFINITELY HURT
AND CONFUSED AND UPSET.

18:00.970 --> 18:02.938
- WELL, NOT REALLY, THOUGH,
RIGHT?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.382
- NO, I WASN'T?

18:04.490 --> 18:07.072
- NO. I TOLD YOU WHY.
- NO, YOU JUST--

18:07.180 --> 18:08.909
- I TOLD YOU WHY I WAS GOING,
AND YOU--

18:09.010 --> 18:10.762
YOU UNDERSTOOD WHY
'CAUSE YOU'RE A MOM.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.871
AND YOU UNDERSTOOD
WHY I WAS GOING, RIGHT?

18:12.980 --> 18:14.629
I'M GOING TO SEE MY DAUGHTER.

18:14.740 --> 18:16.150
- I'M TELLING YOU
HOW I WAS FEELING.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.431
OF COURSE I UNDERSTOOD,

18:17.540 --> 18:19.394
BUT I ALSO FELT HURT
AND CONFUSED.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.603
BUT NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME...

18:21.720 --> 18:23.267
- I MEAN...
- I DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.509
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.235
- NO ONE'S ASKING YOU
ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.025
YOU JUST SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:30.140 --> 18:33.109
SO I'M TELLING YOU HOW I FELT,
NOT WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

18:33.210 --> 18:35.007
I HAD BROKEN UP WITH MARK,

18:35.110 --> 18:36.509
AND I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA BE TOGETHER.

18:36.630 --> 18:40.031
AND THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE,
NO DISCUSSION,

18:40.150 --> 18:41.765
YOU JUST--YOU ANNOUNCE
THAT YOU'RE MOVING--

18:41.870 --> 18:44.213
- IT WAS A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.524
IT WASN'T OUT OF NOWHERE.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.801
IT WAS--YOU KNOW,
THERE WERE ISSUES.

18:47.910 --> 18:48.638
THERE WERE THINGS.

18:48.740 --> 18:52.153
- WELL, WE NEVER TALKED
ABOUT IT.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.636
- FINE.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.331
LOOK, I'M SORRY THEN.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.714
I'M SORRY I HAD TO GO
TO MINNESOTA

18:56.820 --> 19:00.438
AND BE WITH MY DAUGHTER,
WHO I WAS AFRAID OF LOSING.

19:00.550 --> 19:02.302
SO THERE.

19:02.410 --> 19:04.992
I'M SORRY THEN.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.921
- OKAY.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.315
- [clears throat]

19:16.430 --> 19:17.283
- HI.
- HI.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.210
- WOW, YOU ARE
A SCARY LAWYER.

19:19.330 --> 19:20.217
- I'M TIME CRUNCHED.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.150
SORRY TO BARGE IN ON YOU
LIKE THIS.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.329
- NO, NO,
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.558
YOUR BROTHER DID THIS
TO ME ONCE ALREADY.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.123
I'M GETTING A SENSE
IT'S A BRAVERMAN THING.

19:27.230 --> 19:28.959
- WOW. IT MUST BE.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.675
- YEAH.
- SO, LISTEN.

19:30.790 --> 19:31.859
TOMORROW AT THIS MEETING,

19:31.960 --> 19:34.235
I THINK WE SHOULD PRESENT YOU
AS OUR HEADMASTER.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.308
- I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN COMMIT TO THAT.

19:36.410 --> 19:37.786
- WE NEED YOU.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.754
ADAM AND KRISTINA HAVE
ALL THE PASSION IN THE WORLD,

19:39.860 --> 19:41.487
BUT WE NEED YOUR CREDENTIALS
AND YOUR DEGREES,

19:41.590 --> 19:42.864
AND WE NEED YOU AS
THE FACE OF THIS SCHOOL.

19:42.970 --> 19:44.938
- I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT
TO BE THE HEAD OF A SCHOOL.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.100
MAYBE SOMEDAY, BUT I JUST--
- YOU'RE BORN FOR THIS.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.482
AND, LET'S BE HONEST,

19:49.600 --> 19:51.147
HOW MUCH GOOD YOU'RE DOING
WITH 35 KIDS IN YOUR CLASS

19:51.250 --> 19:54.014
AT CEDAR KNOLL VERSUS
HOW MUCH GOOD YOU CAN DO

19:54.120 --> 19:56.532
AT A SMALL SCHOOL
WITH A SMALL CLASS?

19:56.640 --> 19:57.971
- WELL, YOU'RE VERY CONVINCING.

19:58.090 --> 19:59.182
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
- GOOD.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.324
OKAY.
- OKAY.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.395
- THINK ABOUT IT.
- I WILL.

20:01.510 --> 20:02.636
- FAST.
- I WILL.

20:02.750 --> 20:03.956
- 'CAUSE WE NEED YOU TOMORROW.
- OKAY.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.982
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:09.060 --> 20:12.200
- HANK.
- YEAH?

20:13.790 --> 20:15.849
- SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ANGRY
WITH ME.

20:15.970 --> 20:16.925
- YEAH, I AM.
- MM-HMM.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.371
- I AM ANGRY.

20:18.490 --> 20:21.004
YOU KNOW, YOU TOLD ME
TO APOLOGIZE.

20:21.110 --> 20:23.453
MADE IT WORSE,
MADE IT MUCH WORSE.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.039
- SOUNDS LIKE TO ME LIKE YOUR
APOLOGY WASN'T ENTIRELY SINCERE.

20:25.150 --> 20:27.186
- YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS MAD.

20:27.290 --> 20:30.908
I WAS MAD THAT I WAS...
DOING IT.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.011
EVERYTHING WAS FINE, YOU KNOW.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.087
FINE ENOUGH, AT LEAST.

20:34.190 --> 20:38.297
NOW I COME TO YOU,
EVERYTHING'S BLOWING UP.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.288
- EVERYTHING WASN'T FINE, HANK.

20:40.410 --> 20:41.980
YOU CAME TO ME BECAUSE
YOU WONDERED IF THE POTENTIAL

20:42.100 --> 20:45.547
OF HAVING ASPERGER'S HAS HAD
AN EFFECT ON YOUR LIFE

20:45.650 --> 20:46.821
AND YOUR RELATIONSHIPS:

20:46.930 --> 20:50.058
YOUR EX-WIFE, YOUR DAUGHTER,
WORK, SARAH.

20:50.170 --> 20:53.207
AND NOW WE'RE EXPLORING
THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT HAS,

20:53.320 --> 20:54.890
AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

20:55.010 --> 20:59.356
- WELL, IT SHOULD BE GETTING
BETTER NOW, THOUGH, OKAY?

20:59.460 --> 21:00.904
IT'S NOT.
IT'S WORSE.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.798
- SARAH HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE
HURT AND UPSET BY WHAT HAPPENED.

21:04.910 --> 21:06.081
SARAH IS NOT MAD AT YOU
BECAUSE OF ME.

21:06.190 --> 21:08.226
SARAH IS MAD AT YOU
BECAUSE OF YOU.

21:08.330 --> 21:11.128
- ME? IT'S ALL MY FAULT,
RIGHT?

21:11.230 --> 21:12.674
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

21:12.780 --> 21:14.190
- NO.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.949
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WITH ASPERGER'S
TAKE ACTIONS

21:16.060 --> 21:20.133
WITHOUT REALIZING
THEIR EFFECTS ON OTHER PEOPLE.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.856
- SO THEN YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S ASPERGER'S FAULT, RIGHT?

21:22.970 --> 21:26.064
DO I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ASPERGER'S?

21:26.180 --> 21:30.458
- YES. YES, YOU DO.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.176
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS,

21:33.290 --> 21:36.908
THEY CAN BE PARTICULARLY TRICKY
FOR PEOPLE WITH ASPERGER'S.

21:37.010 --> 21:40.184
IT CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING
FOR SPOUSES, PARTNERS.

21:40.290 --> 21:43.111
- BASICALLY, YOU'RE JUST TELLING
ME THAT--NOT EVEN WORTH IT.

21:43.230 --> 21:44.982
- NO, I'M SAYING
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT.

21:45.090 --> 21:47.843
AND THE FIRST STEP IS ADMITTING
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT

21:47.960 --> 21:49.336
INSTEAD OF FIGHTING IT:

21:49.440 --> 21:52.091
ADMITTING YOU'RE WRONG,
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.508
AND ONCE YOU DO THAT,

21:53.620 --> 21:56.236
YOU HAVE TO BE AS HONEST
AND AS VULNERABLE AS YOU CAN BE

21:56.340 --> 21:58.069
WITH SARAH.

21:58.170 --> 21:59.512
- I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
- WHY?

21:59.620 --> 22:03.408
- I DON'T WANT TO DO IT
'CAUSE THEN WHAT IF...

22:03.520 --> 22:05.693
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY?

22:05.800 --> 22:07.210
FEAR OF RECIPROCITY, RIGHT?

22:07.320 --> 22:09.424
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

22:09.530 --> 22:12.738
IS...
IT'S AN ASPERGER'S THING.

22:12.840 --> 22:13.283
- NAH.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.426
NOT AN ASPERGER'S THING.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.600
IT'S AN EVERYBODY THING.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.141
- IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

22:48.260 --> 22:49.215
- HERE WE GO.

22:49.330 --> 22:52.117
WOW!

22:52.230 --> 22:53.538
- YES!
- YES!

22:53.640 --> 22:54.880
- OH, GOOD.
- WOW.

22:54.990 --> 22:56.059
THAT'S SO IMPRESSIVE!

22:56.160 --> 22:57.604
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I SPEND
A LOT OF TIME WATCHING

22:57.720 --> 22:59.642
THE FOOD NETWORK
SINCE I'VE BEEN UNEMPLOYED.

22:59.750 --> 23:00.569
AND I GOT TO SAY,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

23:00.680 --> 23:01.374
IT'S ACTUALLY COME IN HANDY.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.300
- WELL, WAIT TILL I TASTE IT

23:03.410 --> 23:04.331
BEFORE YOU REALLY...
- ALL RIGHT.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.758
- CONGRATULATE YOURSELF THERE.

23:05.860 --> 23:08.613
- HOW IS IT?

23:08.730 --> 23:10.448
- IT'S REALLY GOOD.
- YEAH?

23:10.560 --> 23:11.697
- IT'S REALLY GOOD.
- MMM.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.244
- MM-HMM.
- IT IS GOOD.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.727
- WOW.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.319
THANK YOU, THIS IS--
THIS IS AMAZING.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.660
I SHOULD HAVE COOKED YOU DINNER.

23:19.770 --> 23:21.419
YOU DID ALL
THAT SPREADSHEET WORK FOR ME.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.010
- NO, COME ON.
I WAS HAPPY TO DO IT. HONESTLY.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.394
I WAS A LITTLE TOO HAPPY.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.250
IT WAS KIND OF SCARY
THAT I WAS THAT EXCITED

23:26.370 --> 23:29.396
ABOUT WORKING
ON MICROSOl-T EXCEL.

23:29.510 --> 23:30.818
- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.672
I'VE BEEN A NEW PERSON
THIS WEEK.

23:32.790 --> 23:35.190
- YOU HAVE.
AND IT'S BEEN...

23:35.310 --> 23:37.164
IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE,
HONESTLY.

23:37.270 --> 23:38.441
- [laughs]

23:38.550 --> 23:41.064
- I ACTUALLY HAVE, UM,
I HAVE SOME NEWS.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.489
NOT BIG NEWS, TINY NEWS.

23:42.590 --> 23:44.444
REMEMBER THAT JOB INTERVIEW
THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT?

23:44.560 --> 23:45.788
- OH, YEAH.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.242
- WELL, THEY CALLED ME
FOR A THIRD INTERVIEW,

23:47.350 --> 23:48.999
SO IT'S LOOKING GOOD.

23:49.110 --> 23:50.668
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- [laughing] THANK YOU.

23:50.770 --> 23:53.830
- THAT'S PRETTY BIG NEWS.

23:53.940 --> 23:56.352
- THE THING ABOUT IT IS, UM...
- [clears throat]

23:56.460 --> 23:58.974
- WHEN THEY CALLED TO TELL ME,

23:59.090 --> 24:02.981
THE FIRST THING
THAT I THOUGHT OF WAS...

24:03.090 --> 24:04.398
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

24:04.510 --> 24:08.606
YOU'VE BEEN
A REALLY GOOD THING FOR ME.

24:08.720 --> 24:13.748
KIND OF THE ONLY GOOD THING
IN THIS WHOLE...

24:13.860 --> 24:16.897
CRAPPY YEAR.

24:20.700 --> 24:23.248
I JUST--
- I--I'M SO SORRY.

24:23.350 --> 24:27.172
I AM--I'M SORRY TO DO THIS.

24:27.290 --> 24:30.077
BUT I SHOULD GO.

24:30.190 --> 24:31.259
- DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
- NO, I'M JUST--

24:31.360 --> 24:33.533
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.255
I THOUGHT I WAS.
I'M REALLY NOT.

24:47.170 --> 24:49.400
- BRO, LOOK.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.727
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

24:51.830 --> 24:52.649
- WHAT?

24:52.760 --> 24:53.863
- THE TENSION, MAN.

24:53.970 --> 24:54.868
I CAN'T HANDLE THE TENSION,
YOU KNOW?

24:54.970 --> 24:58.007
BOTH OF MY PARENTS
ARE PSYCHIATRISTS.

24:58.110 --> 24:59.623
- NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

24:59.730 --> 25:02.619
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW.

25:02.740 --> 25:08.042
- ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO, MAN.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.184
YOU ARE GONNA CHUG A BEER

25:09.300 --> 25:12.918
AND TELL ME SOMETHING
THAT YOU HATE ABOUT ME.

25:13.020 --> 25:16.228
THEN YOU'RE GONNA DO IT
AGAIN AND AGAIN...

25:16.340 --> 25:17.887
TILL YOU'RE DONE.

25:17.990 --> 25:19.332
AND THEN WE CAN
BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.816
- NO, BECAUSE WE NEVER
WERE FRIENDS.

25:20.930 --> 25:24.229
'CAUSE YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME
A SINGLE QUESTION ABOUT MYSELF,

25:24.350 --> 25:25.578
AND ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOU.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.202
- THAT'S A GOOD START.

25:26.310 --> 25:30.246
CHUG.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.734
[pop]

25:34.840 --> 25:36.899
- YOU HAVE TERRIBLE TASTE
IN MUSIC, YOU KNOW?

25:37.010 --> 25:38.830
MY MOM MAKES BETTER CDs
THAN YOU DO.

25:38.950 --> 25:40.281
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH, SHE DOES.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.914
- AND YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE SO
COOL BECAUSE YOU PLAY LACROSSE.

25:43.020 --> 25:45.363
REALLY? AND YOU DON'T EVEN START
WHEN YOU PLAY.

25:45.470 --> 25:47.324
- I HAVEN'T PLAYED
A MINUTE ALL SEASON.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.646
I AM TOTALLY OVERCOMPENSATING.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.092
- YEAH, YOU'RE BAD
AT THE WHOLE SPORT.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.747
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING
FROM THE FRIDGE.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.929
LITERALLY EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW?

25:53.030 --> 25:55.066
AND THEN YOU GIVE MY TOOTHBRUSH
TO SOME GIRL

25:55.170 --> 25:56.262
YOU JUST HOOKED UP WITH?
- YEAH, I DID DO THAT.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.541
- THAT'S ANNOYING.

25:58.660 --> 26:00.514
AND IT PISSES ME OFF
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN STUDY,

26:00.620 --> 26:01.826
AND THEN YOU GET GOOD GRADES

26:01.930 --> 26:03.795
ON SOME TEST
THAT I ACTUALLY WORK AT.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.583
- COME ON, KEEP 'EM COMING,
KEEP 'EM COMING!

26:05.700 --> 26:07.213
- NO! BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.242
AND I'M NOTHING BUT COOL TO YOU!
YOU WENT AND STABBED ME

26:09.360 --> 26:10.554
IN THE BACK.
- HOW?

26:10.670 --> 26:11.762
- Al-TER I'VE BEEN RESPECTFUL
TO YOU!

26:11.880 --> 26:13.188
- HOW? SAY IT!
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW! NO!

26:13.290 --> 26:15.565
BECAUSE YOU SLEPT WITH NATALIE,
AND YOU KNOW I LIKE HER!

26:15.670 --> 26:17.638
YOU KNOW THAT! GOD!
YOU'RE SUCH A--

26:17.740 --> 26:19.776
- OKAY! OKAY, I'M SORRY!
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS!

26:19.880 --> 26:21.700
GOD, NO, YOU'RE NOT!
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING.

26:21.820 --> 26:22.502
- OH, DAMN, HOLT.

26:22.610 --> 26:25.499
I SWEAR TO GOD, I'M SORRY.

26:25.610 --> 26:27.237
- [exhales]

26:27.340 --> 26:30.332
[both laughing]

26:30.450 --> 26:31.542
- OH, MAN.

26:31.650 --> 26:34.517
- ONE DAY
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER

26:34.620 --> 26:38.795
- ZEEK, IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.414
- YEAH, WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF.

26:41.530 --> 26:45.899
OKAY, YEAH.
THIS IS--THIS IS "KEEP."

26:46.010 --> 26:48.069
UH...

26:48.190 --> 26:50.522
THAT'S "PAWN OFF TO THE KIDS,"
AND THAT'S "THROW AWAY STUFF."

26:50.640 --> 26:53.108
- THIS IS PAWN OFF TO THE KIDS?

26:53.230 --> 26:53.537
- NO, THAT'S THROW AWAY.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.392
- OH, NO, NO.

26:55.510 --> 26:57.535
NO, THIS IS ADAM'S STAR GLOBE.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.504
HE WON THIS.

26:59.610 --> 27:02.022
THIS IS KEEP, RIGHT?

27:02.130 --> 27:02.926
AND...
[scoffs]

27:03.030 --> 27:05.510
SARAH WANTS THIS.
[tinny mu5|c plays]

27:05.620 --> 27:07.201
IT'S HER FIRST JEWELRY BOX.

27:07.310 --> 27:08.720
I GAVE IT TO HER
ON HER 13TH BIRTHDAY.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.582
THIS IS OUR FONDUE POT.
THAT WAS A WEDDING PRESENT.

27:10.690 --> 27:13.033
- MILLIE, WE CAN'T KEEP
EVERYTHING.

27:13.140 --> 27:14.721
- BUT THESE THINGS
HAVE SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.035
- EVERYTHING HERE
HAS SOME SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

27:17.150 --> 27:19.618
I MEAN, HELL, THE WHOLE HOUSE
HAS SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

27:19.740 --> 27:21.492
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,
HONEY.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.807
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
WHEN YOU DOWNSIZE.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.424
- GOD, YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE
THING I LOOKED AT TODAY

27:26.540 --> 27:27.609
WAS AWFUL.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.018
- WELL, YOU JUST STARTED
LOOKING.

27:29.130 --> 27:31.223
COME ON, YOU'RE GONNA FIND
SOMETHING.

27:31.330 --> 27:33.469
- YOU KNOW, I WAS SO WRAPPED UP
IN CONVINCING YOU TO MOVE

27:33.580 --> 27:35.639
AND JUST BEING HEARD,

27:35.750 --> 27:38.639
THAT MAYBE I DIDN'T LISTEN
TO YOU ENOUGH.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.648
- DON'T START SECOND-GUESSING
YOURSELF HERE.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.204
- YEAH, BUT MAYBE
YOU WERE RIGHT.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.062
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
BE SELLING THE HOUSE.

27:44.170 --> 27:46.274
- THIS ISN'T THE TIME
TO GET COLD FEET.

27:46.380 --> 27:47.586
- NO, IT'S ONLY PARTLY THAT.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.486
I'M REALLY AFRAID THAT WE'RE NOT
GONNA FIND ANYTHING BETTER.

27:49.590 --> 27:52.309
WHAT IF WE MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE?

27:52.420 --> 27:53.557
- OH, MY GOD.

27:53.670 --> 27:55.661
OKAY, NOW LOOK.

27:55.770 --> 27:58.421
MILLIE...

27:58.530 --> 28:01.670
YOU AND I ARE A TEAM HERE.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.088
ALL RIGHT?

28:03.190 --> 28:06.648
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND A PLACE.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

28:06.750 --> 28:10.334
AND EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE FINE.
COME ON.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.543
I PROMISE.

28:11.650 --> 28:13.789
[kisses]
- OKAY.

28:13.890 --> 28:14.925
- ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

28:17.350 --> 28:19.409
- EVEN WITH THE MEASURES
PROVIDED BY THE MIDDLE SCHOOL,

28:19.520 --> 28:20.999
HE'S NOT GETTING THE HELP
HE NEEDS TO THRIVE.

28:21.110 --> 28:21.963
- AND WE HAVE
NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVES

28:22.070 --> 28:24.345
FOR KIDS LIKE MAX
WITH A HIGH IQ.

28:24.460 --> 28:27.099
- STUDENTS LIKE MAX,
WHO LEARN DIFFERENTLY,

28:27.220 --> 28:28.938
ALONGSIDE A SMALL GROUP
OF MAINSTREAM KIDS--

28:29.050 --> 28:30.529
- WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING WE CAN

28:30.630 --> 28:32.074
WITHIN THE SYSTEM--

28:32.190 --> 28:33.976
- THESE KIDS ARE SO SMART, AND
THEY'RE SO FULL OF POTENTIAL.

28:34.090 --> 28:37.150
- I FIND THAT HAVING A MIXED
CLASSROOM LIKE THAT

28:37.260 --> 28:39.945
IS MORE CONDUCIVE FOR
LEARNING AND BETTER PERFORMANCE.

28:40.060 --> 28:42.153
I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES
ME MOST EXCITED

28:42.270 --> 28:44.647
ABOUT BEING HEADMASTER
OF THIS SCHOOL.

28:44.750 --> 28:45.990
- [clears throat]

28:46.100 --> 28:48.500
YOU'RE PROJECTING
AN ENROLLMENT OF 40 STUDENTS

28:48.620 --> 28:49.644
IN YEAR ONE?

28:49.760 --> 28:51.239
- MM-HMM.
- CORRECT.

28:51.350 --> 28:51.896
- THAT'S LOW.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.683
- IF I MIGHT INTERJECT.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.961
THAT IS INTENTIONAL.

28:56.070 --> 28:57.799
THEY'RE BEING VERY SMART
ABOUT STARTING SMALL.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.174
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,

28:59.280 --> 29:00.907
OVER HALF OF THE CHARTERS
THAT FAIL EACH YEAR

29:01.010 --> 29:04.138
DO SO BECAUSE
THEY OVEREXTEND IN YEAR ONE.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.593
- I UNDERSTAND,
BUT WE ARE SEEING TOO MANY

29:06.710 --> 29:08.849
OF THESE START-UPS NOT MAKE IT
PAST THEIR FIRST YEAR.

29:08.950 --> 29:11.009
- MM-HMM.
- FUNDING IS BASED ON ENROLLMENT

29:11.120 --> 29:14.908
AND YOU WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO COVER OPERATIONS.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.954
- WELL, SINCE THEY'RE SERVING
THE SPECIAL NEEDS COMMUNITY,

29:17.060 --> 29:18.857
THEY ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR SELPA,
SO THAT WILL MORE THAN COVER--

29:18.960 --> 29:22.578
- I DON'T RECALL SEEING SELPA
IN THIS PETITION REPORT.

29:22.690 --> 29:24.237
- IT'S NEW. I FILED IT
AS A SUPPLEMENT.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.922
YOU'LL SEE APPENDIX E.
SO IF YOU LOOK THERE,

29:27.040 --> 29:29.827
BETWEEN TRADITIONAL ADA FUNDING,
BLOCK GRANTS, AND SELPA,

29:29.940 --> 29:30.759
WE'LL ACTUALLY HAVE
QUITE A SURPLUS IN YEAR ONE,

29:30.870 --> 29:33.077
WHICH IS GREAT.

29:33.180 --> 29:34.863
THEY HAVE A CUSHION
GOING INTO YEAR TWO.

29:34.980 --> 29:36.595
THEN THEY CAN ADD A GRADE LEVEL.

29:36.700 --> 29:39.760
- I SEE.
WELL, THAT DEFINITELY HELPS.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.939
- WELL, HOW CERTAIN ARE YOU
THAT YOU CAN FIND

29:42.050 --> 29:43.153
40 STUDENTS TO ENROLL?

29:43.260 --> 29:47.048
- KRISTINA AND ADAM
GOT 271 PARENT SIGNATURES

29:47.160 --> 29:48.707
ON THEIR PETITION
WHEN THE LAW REQUIRES 20.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.812
KRISTINA RAN AS A COMPLETE
UNKNOWN FOR MAYOR OF BERKELEY

29:51.920 --> 29:54.263
AND NEARLY RAN AWAY
WITH THE THING.

29:54.370 --> 29:56.611
IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.857
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO APPROVE NOW,

29:57.960 --> 30:00.303
I'M HAPPY TO FILE AN APPEAL.

30:00.410 --> 30:01.923
I WAS A CORPORATE LAWYER.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.200
I LOVE PAPERWORK.

30:03.310 --> 30:06.279
I'LL REFILE ONCE A WEEK
IF I HAVE TO.

30:09.770 --> 30:11.738
- HAVE I SHOWN YOU THIS?
- WHAT?

30:11.840 --> 30:14.729
"TAPSCOTT INTERIORS."
$14,000?

30:14.840 --> 30:16.046
- THAT'S THE ESTIMATE
FOR THE HARDWOOD FLOORS.

30:16.150 --> 30:18.914
- IT'S HARDWOOD FLOORS.
- THE OTHER BID WAS 16,000.

30:19.020 --> 30:22.979
- REALLY?
- IT'S NOT GOLD-WOOD FLOORING.

30:23.090 --> 30:23.988
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.741
I DON'T HAVE 14 GRAND.

30:26.850 --> 30:28.579
- CARPETING?

30:28.680 --> 30:29.886
- I NEED A LOAN.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.092
I NEED TO BORROW SOME MONEY
FROM THE COMPANY.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.952
- WE DON'T HAVE $14,000
LAYING AROUND, CROSBY.

30:33.070 --> 30:35.470
- HOW DO WE NOT HAVE 14,000?

30:35.590 --> 30:37.751
- WE DON'T HAVE 14,000 BECAUSE
WHEN WE GOT THOSE SONGS BACK,

30:37.870 --> 30:40.338
WE GAVE AWAY ALL THOSE FEES, AND
NOW WE'RE PAYING FOR THIS PARTY.

30:40.450 --> 30:42.008
THAT'S OUR SLUSH FUND.
THAT'S IT.

30:42.110 --> 30:44.340
- YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THIS
PARTY IS THE REASON

30:44.460 --> 30:45.904
WE DON'T HAVE
14,000 AT OUR DISPOSAL?

30:46.010 --> 30:47.875
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALM DOWN?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.493
ONCE THEY GO ON TOUR
WITH FOUR-D,

30:49.600 --> 30:50.874
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE MONEY,

30:50.980 --> 30:52.322
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO PAY
FOR YOUR FLOORING.

30:52.430 --> 30:53.419
- ONCE THEY GO ON TOUR
WITH FOUR-D.

30:53.540 --> 30:56.703
YOU HEARD HIS REACTION TO THAT.
- YEAH?

30:56.820 --> 30:58.151
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME MY
HARDWOOD FLOORS ARE DEPENDENT

30:58.270 --> 31:00.738
ON OLIVER ROME,
THAT NARCISSISTIC MANIAC,

31:00.850 --> 31:02.260
DECIDING TO GO ON A TOUR

31:02.370 --> 31:04.474
THAT HE HAS FLAT-OUT SAID
HE'S NOT GONNA GO ON.

31:04.580 --> 31:06.093
- YES.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.168
LOOK, JUST ENJOY A LITTLE MORE
TOGETHERNESS WITH MOM AND DAD.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.611
- THEY SIGNED ON THE HOUSE!

31:09.720 --> 31:10.994
- THEY DID?

31:11.110 --> 31:12.998
- YES! MY FAMILY IS EFFECT IVELY
HOMELESS.

31:13.110 --> 31:15.487
- WAIT A SECOND,
THEY'RE SELLING THE HOUSE?

31:15.590 --> 31:17.524
- YES.

31:17.630 --> 31:19.769
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
- SO I--YOU KNOW--

31:19.870 --> 31:21.178
CAN I GET, FOR
A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,

31:21.290 --> 31:23.349
A BRO-LOAN?

31:23.460 --> 31:24.324
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

31:24.430 --> 31:25.806
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.
- WHAT?

31:25.910 --> 31:26.569
- HADDIE'S GOING TO CORNELL.

31:26.670 --> 31:28.911
IT'S COSTING ME A FORTUNE.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.079
- SHE SHOULD HAVE WENT
TO STATE SCHOOL.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.499
- HOW MANY OF THOSE
DID YOU TAKE?

31:33.610 --> 31:35.123
- 12.

31:35.230 --> 31:36.959
THE DINING HALL LADIES
WERE GETTING SUSPICIOUS,

31:37.060 --> 31:38.618
SO I HAD TO STOP.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.268
- YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT
A FREEZER IN THE MINI-FRIDGE

31:41.380 --> 31:42.540
THAT WE HAVE?

31:42.650 --> 31:44.686
- YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH. NO.

31:44.790 --> 31:45.688
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE.

31:45.800 --> 31:46.789
- WELL, HERE, TAKE ONE.

31:46.900 --> 31:50.313
LET'S FINISH THESE
BEFORE WE GET BACK.

31:56.050 --> 31:57.005
- [sighs]

31:57.120 --> 31:59.145
- I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING,

31:59.260 --> 32:01.399
AND YOU MIGHT THROW A BEER
AT ME AGAIN.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.467
- WHAT?

32:02.570 --> 32:05.949
- I MESSED THAT UP FOR YOU,
AND I'M SORRY.

32:06.060 --> 32:09.336
BUT YOU KIND OF
MESSED IT UP FIRST.

32:09.440 --> 32:10.839
ALL THAT'S NOT REALLY ON HER.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.475
IT'S ON YOU.

32:14.580 --> 32:17.925
[knock on door]

32:18.030 --> 32:19.270
- HI.
- HEY.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.940
HI.
YOU GOT A MINUTE TO...TALK?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.928
- YEAH. I JUST SAW YOU AT WORK.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.075
YEAH.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

32:25.180 --> 32:27.694
THIS IS NOT--NOT LIKE SHOP TALK.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.449
- OH.

32:29.560 --> 32:31.118
- YOU DON'T THINK, LIKE,
AROUND THE SHOP

32:31.220 --> 32:35.907
WE'VE BEEN WALKING ON EGG SHELLS
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS?

32:36.020 --> 32:39.114
- OH...I DON'T KNOW.

32:39.230 --> 32:41.881
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT--
- YEAH.

32:41.990 --> 32:42.433
YEAH. YEAH, THAT.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.121
- IT'S OKAY.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.573
- YEAH. WELL, NO.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.329
IT'S NOT OKAY.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.260
IT'S NOT OKAY.
I MESSED UP.

32:50.380 --> 32:53.929
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
THAT I MOVED OUT ON YOU.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.032
I-I REALLY, UH...

32:57.140 --> 33:00.769
I'M SORRY ABOUT
HOW YOU FELT ABOUT IT TOO.

33:00.870 --> 33:02.724
- THANK YOU.
IT'S OKAY.

33:02.840 --> 33:03.761
- WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT,
THOUGH.

33:03.870 --> 33:06.043
IT WAS JUST A CRAPPY THING
TO DO.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.947
AND, UM...

33:08.050 --> 33:09.187
- LOOK, IT'S IN THE PAST,
YOU KNOW.

33:09.290 --> 33:14.978
- YEAH, I JUST WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING ELSE TOO.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.433
UH...I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS,

33:17.540 --> 33:22.239
SO JUST BEAR WITH ME
FOR ONE SECOND.

33:22.340 --> 33:24.137
YOU KNOW, I'VE MESSED UP.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.232
I MESSED UP IN MY LIFE A LOT.

33:27.350 --> 33:29.238
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M WORKING WITH PELIKAN,

33:29.350 --> 33:33.650
AND MAYBE IT'S ASPERGER'S,
MAYBE IT'S NOT.

33:33.770 --> 33:34.998
I DON'T KNOW.

33:35.110 --> 33:37.169
THE BOTTOM LINE IS
I PUSH PEOPLE AWAY.

33:37.290 --> 33:40.874
PEOPLE GET CLOSE TO ME,
AND I JUST--

33:40.980 --> 33:43.665
I START ACTING
LIKE A JACKASS AROUND 'EM.

33:43.780 --> 33:46.772
AND I JUST--EVENTUALLY, I JUST--
I WEAR 'EM DOWN.

33:46.880 --> 33:50.361
AND THEY GO AWAY.

33:50.470 --> 33:52.028
YOU KNOW, I HATE THAT.
I HATE THAT ABOUT MYSELF.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.543
BUT I-I'M TRYING TO CHANGE IT.

33:55.650 --> 33:58.301
I'M TRYING TO GET--
I'M TRYING HARD.

33:58.410 --> 34:02.892
BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT YOU...

34:03.000 --> 34:04.069
I SEE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

34:04.180 --> 34:08.139
AND DESPITE EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE...

34:08.250 --> 34:12.357
DESPITE ALL THE CRAP
THAT I'VE PULLED

34:12.460 --> 34:15.213
AND STUPID THINGS
THAT I'VE SAID,

34:15.320 --> 34:16.139
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

34:16.260 --> 34:22.256
YOU'RE--YOU DIDN'T, UH,
LEAVE.

34:22.370 --> 34:24.565
AND THAT'S SHOCKING TO ME,
YOU KNOW.

34:24.680 --> 34:29.788
JUST--IT GIVES ME HOPE.

34:29.890 --> 34:33.064
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T GO AWAY.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.546
I DON'T WANT TO PUSH YOU AWAY.

34:34.650 --> 34:37.232
I LIKE BEING AROUND YOU
TOO MUCH.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.029
YOU DON'T GOT TO RESPOND
TO THAT.

34:41.140 --> 34:44.212
THAT'S, UH...YEAH.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.039
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.004
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.111
SEE YOU TOMORROW,
I GUESS, RIGHT?

34:51.220 --> 34:52.596
[door closes]

34:59.230 --> 35:00.538
- HEY! CAMILLE!

35:00.650 --> 35:01.639

35:07.860 --> 35:09.020
COME ON,

LET'S GET IN THE TRUCK.

35:09.690 --> 35:12.238
OKAY, YOU READY?

35:12.350 --> 35:13.897

35:14.000 --> 35:14.750
[snickers]
OKAY.

35:14.870 --> 35:16.349
I'M READY.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.831
YOU WANT TO SEE INSIDE?

HEY, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S AN OFFICE UPSTAIRS.

35:43.270 --> 35:45.158
I MEAN, IT'S GOT
A LOT OF LIGHT, YOU KNOW,

35:45.280 --> 35:47.657
AND THAT'S GOOD
FOR AN ART STUDIO, RIGHT?

35:47.760 --> 35:48.829
- UH, YEAH.

35:48.930 --> 35:50.693
- I MEAN, I COULD FIX IT UP
A LITTLE BIT.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.767
I MEAN, GIVE ME A PROJECT.

35:51.870 --> 35:53.246
I MEAN, THE WHOLE PLACE
NEEDS A COAT OF PAINT.

35:53.350 --> 35:55.659
- HOW'D YOU FIND IT?

35:55.770 --> 35:56.907
- WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

35:57.010 --> 35:58.659
I'M KIND OF PUSHY,

35:58.770 --> 36:00.806
AND I THINK KAREN

YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT?

36:17.790 --> 36:21.305
- ZEEK!

36:21.420 --> 36:24.309
THERE'S A GARDEN
YOU CAN WORK IN, YOU KNOW.

36:24.420 --> 36:28.766
I COULD COME OUT HERE, GET
NAKED, AND SMOKE MY CIGARS.

36:28.870 --> 36:33.739
- I'M SURE THE NEIGHBORS
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.592
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36:35.710 --> 36:38.087

36:53.590 --> 36:54.511

36:54.620 --> 36:56.269
WHEN THE GUYS GET HERE--

AND THE FOUR-D GUYS,

36:57.900 --> 36:59.868
I NEED YOU TO TRY

36:59.970 --> 37:02.143
OR FRIENDLY OR SOME VERSION

37:07.460 --> 37:08.836
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M THE TYPE OF ARTIST

THAT'S GONNA GO ON TOUR
WITH [Whispers] A BOY BAND.

37:11.220 --> 37:12.664
ALL RIGHT?
- OKAY.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.259
WELL, I DON'T THINK I'M THE TYPE
OF ARTIST THAT WOULD BE HOMELESS

37:14.370 --> 37:16.258
BECAUSE OF $14,000 WORTH
OF FLOOR DAMAGE.

37:16.370 --> 37:17.359
BUT I HAVE MOLD, OLIVER.

37:17.470 --> 37:19.438

METAPHORICAL MOLD OR SOMETHING?

37:22.930 --> 37:24.090

ONE DAY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A FAMILY.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.094
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A HOUSE.
- MM-HMM.

37:27.210 --> 37:28.199

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MOLD

37:28.310 --> 37:29.470
OR YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME
PLUMBING FIASCO

37:29.590 --> 37:31.034
THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE
YOU TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

37:31.140 --> 37:32.368

38:59.640 --> 39:00.846
I MEAN, I'M JUST A TEACHER.

39:00.950 --> 39:02.087
I FEEL LIKE I'M
NOT COOL ENOUGH FOR THIS.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.600

39:04.720 --> 39:06.574
