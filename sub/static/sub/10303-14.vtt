01:16.160 --> 01:18.151
Here we go.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.999
Fresh from the oven.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.792
Not that I bake, mind you.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.356
It's just that that's where I hide it
from Al and the kids.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.717
I'll get the forks.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.431
Now, let's see.
Where do I keep the good plastic?

01:43.640 --> 01:45.676
We couldn't wait.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.993
Glad I'm not made
of buttercream frosting.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.039
Mom.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.198
What is the best news
that you could possibly hear?

02:02.440 --> 02:05.000
They're making men in flavours?

02:06.440 --> 02:09.352
Yeah. I got a commercial.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.471
Now, it's not just any commercial.

02:11.680 --> 02:16.151
I am going to be
the new Waist Away Diet girl.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.317
Honey, that is terrific.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.596
Waist Away. That's a good diet.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.473
I've lost hundreds of pounds
on that one.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.709
You know, I am one of those people
that can't lose weight no matter what.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.434
I don't know.
You know, slow metabolism, I guess.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.198
I don't know.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.397
Mom, don't you see
what this means?

02:39.640 --> 02:41.710
This could be my springboard
to Hollywood.

02:41.960 --> 02:46.033
TV, movies, made-for-TV movies.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.754
Movies made from old TV.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.119
Mom, I'm finally on my way.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.153
Hey, Buck, I'm finally on my way.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.558
Mr. Clock, I'm finally on my way.

03:02.520 --> 03:06.308
Bud and the rubber woman,
I'm finally on my way.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.309
I take it Al and his NO MA'AM herd...

03:13.520 --> 03:16.273
...had a meeting tonight?
- Yeah. Why?

03:16.480 --> 03:19.040
Because there's a bumper sticker
on my car which says:

03:19.240 --> 03:23.392
"Support feminists.
Hairy women need love too."

03:27.400 --> 03:30.153
So tell me, where
is the little knuckle-walker?

03:31.720 --> 03:34.553
With the rest of the husbands
down at the Jiggly Room.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.352
The Jiggly Room?

03:36.560 --> 03:37.754
Isn't that a strip club?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.276
No, it's a school of science
and industry.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.392
Do you all mind if I ask a question?

03:43.760 --> 03:45.796
Do we have to stop eating?

03:47.400 --> 03:50.631
Why do you let your husbands
go to places like that?

03:50.840 --> 03:52.831
Think about the message
that they're sending.

03:53.080 --> 03:57.119
They're saying, you don't turn us on,
so we'll just get stimulated elsewhere.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.914
Well, that's sick. It's disgusting. It...

04:00.120 --> 04:02.839
Oh, my God,
is that John F. Kennedy Jr.?

04:15.720 --> 04:18.154
It's downright insulting.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.155
Marcie, what is the big deal?
All men go to strip clubs.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.152
Not my Jefferson.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.794
You may let the eyes
of your men wander...

04:27.000 --> 04:29.878
...but I am more than enough woman
for mine.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.159
Did you see the headlights
on that last stripper?

04:38.800 --> 04:42.349
How about the tail lights
on the one with the tattoos?

04:44.040 --> 04:47.396
No. No, no, no.
Those weren't tattoos.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.828
Those were my fingerprints.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.558
Okay, you guys go ahead on in.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.395
Now, in case Marcie's in there,
remember, I wasn't with you.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.473
I was working security at...

05:04.760 --> 05:06.512
Wong's Dry Cleaning.

05:08.040 --> 05:12.238
Okay, guys, it's time to face
the wives.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.595
All right, now remember this,
men.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.994
Just as a man's eyes...

05:19.200 --> 05:21.998
...must adjust to the light
when he's been in the dark...

05:22.200 --> 05:24.760
...so, too, must a man's eyes
adjust to his wife...

05:25.000 --> 05:26.718
...when he's been in the nudie bar.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.439
Ergo, do not look directly at them.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.592
Let's do it.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.153
Hey, Peg.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.474
Hi, guys. How was the club?

05:55.720 --> 05:58.792
The same thing.
You know, it's no big deal.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.908
Just a minute.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.953
Now, tell me, what do you guys
get out of going to strip clubs?

06:04.200 --> 06:05.679
We get out of the house.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.791
Seriously, Al.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.037
Come on now, Peg.
Don't let Foghorn Leghorn here...

06:13.240 --> 06:15.390
...make an issue out of this.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.959
It's no big deal.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.958
Oh, hey, guys.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.590
I just got back
from guarding stuff.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.039
- Where have you been?
- Jefferson.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.675
They went to a strip club.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.999
You make me sick.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.433
Jefferson thinks it's a big deal, Al.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.717
So tell us. What do you do there?

06:49.160 --> 06:53.995
Nothing. Sit and watch ladies
dance and jump.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.797
- And are they naked?
- No!

06:59.800 --> 07:01.950
No, they're wearing those...

07:02.160 --> 07:04.754
- What-you-call-its.
- Shoes?

07:07.520 --> 07:10.193
Well, all I can say is that
if I ever caught my Jefferson...

07:10.400 --> 07:13.073
...going into a place like that,
I would do things to him...

07:13.280 --> 07:16.875
...that would make Lorena Bobbitt
toss her cookies.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.556
And what do you do
with those strippers?

07:23.760 --> 07:26.718
- Do you touch them?
- No!

07:27.360 --> 07:31.035
No, we don't do anything with them
that we wouldn't do with you.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.634
And you know we don't touch you.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.198
That's just the point.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.073
Marcie says the only reason
you go there...

07:40.280 --> 07:42.669
...is because we
don't turn you on anymore.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.751
Oh, she does, does she?

07:44.960 --> 07:48.873
Well, how ridiculous is that?
You people don't turn us on anymore.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.191
Anyway, ladies...

07:57.400 --> 08:00.392
...while it may seem that the nudie bar
is a place where men go...

08:00.600 --> 08:04.036
...to watch surgically-altered hooters
sway oddly to bad music.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.719
In reality...

08:05.920 --> 08:10.118
...it is a place where men go
to relax and unwind and...

08:10.480 --> 08:13.790
...watch surgically-altered hooters
sway...

08:14.000 --> 08:16.434
...oddly to bad music, Peg.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.518
Gee, Al, I guess we were misled.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.553
- Sounds like totally innocent fun.
- You're right.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.394
So I guess you wouldn't mind
if we joined you?

08:29.520 --> 08:32.751
- Join us?
- At the nudie bar?

08:33.200 --> 08:36.510
Well, sure.
We wanna relax and unwind too.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.755
From what?

08:37.960 --> 08:41.748
Tearing open them packages
of Ho Hos with your teeth all day?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.711
Exactly.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.036
I mean, no!

08:49.920 --> 08:51.353
Take it or leave it, Al.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.915
Either you take us with you
the next time you go...

08:54.120 --> 08:56.475
...or you are never
going there again.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.560
And just how are you gonna stop us?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.712
We won't give you any money.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.192
Well, that'll do it.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.276
Al, are you nuts?
Taking the wives to the nudie bar?

09:17.480 --> 09:20.790
They're gonna see how we act.
They'll kill us.

09:24.400 --> 09:29.076
Jefferson, first of all, what makes
you think I'm afraid of my wife?

09:29.280 --> 09:32.397
The fact that we're whispering
about this in your garage.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.557
Listen, I got this thing all worked out.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.910
We're going to take them
on Thursdays.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.949
Thursday night?
That's our bowling night.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.957
And why do we go bowling
on Thursday night?

09:50.400 --> 09:54.234
Because at the Jiggly Room,
it's always...

09:54.480 --> 09:56.789
A-cup night.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.229
There's not a doctored yummy
in the house.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.709
Hence, we won't get excited.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.598
But what if we do?

10:11.040 --> 10:13.759
Well, then try to imagine
Jefferson's wife up on stage...

10:14.000 --> 10:15.718
...with no clothes on.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.155
If that doesn't work, try to picture
Jefferson up on stage with no clothes.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.798
What if that doesn't work?

10:32.240 --> 10:34.390
Then you're out of the club.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.790
Hi, I'm here for the commercial.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.036
I'm Kelly Bundy, the Waist Away Girl.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.309
Are you the hairdresser?

10:46.840 --> 10:51.595
No. I'm a professional wrestler
they've nicknamed "The Hairdresser."

10:51.960 --> 10:53.678
Oh, okay.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.119
When the hairdresser gets here...

10:56.320 --> 10:59.198
...tell him that I'm supposed
to be peppy for this commercial...

10:59.400 --> 11:01.356
...so I'd like kind of
a windswept look.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.710
Not too far off the face,
but with the sides...

11:03.920 --> 11:06.434
...with a little bit more texture. Okay?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.073
Done.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.192
Thanks.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.319
Excuse me.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.158
I'm looking for the dressing rooms.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.551
Oh, they're over
in the producer's office.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.076
But he's really stupid.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.795
He had me try on 30 different outfits
before he made up his mind.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.832
Thanks.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.993
Kelly Bundy to the set, please.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.313
Hi, Kelly. I'm your director.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.838
Okay. Okay.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.873
When I say action, I want you
to turn away from the fridge...

11:54.080 --> 11:55.433
...Iook into the camera, say:

11:55.640 --> 11:57.676
"And, baby, look at me now,"
then sip, go...

11:58.560 --> 12:01.279
...and say the flavour.
Can you do that for me?

12:01.920 --> 12:04.036
Is a bear Catholic?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.632
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.111
Places, please.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.033
Oh, how will I know
what the flavour is?

12:18.240 --> 12:20.708
- From the taste.
- Okay.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.752
Waist Away Diet Ad, take one.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.632
Action.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.277
And, baby, look at me now.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.518
Cow pie.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.317
That's cherry.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.878
You taste it.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.039
I have. Look, from now on
we'll just label the cups.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.677
Cups? How much of this bile
do I have to drink?

12:58.960 --> 13:00.518
Action.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.997
And, baby, look at me now.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.157
Kiwi.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.190
Cabbage.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.672
Salmon.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.432
Cut.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.275
Well, this is it, dear.
This is where I go.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.790
- Go right this way.
- Right this way, ladies. Right this way.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.669
- Jeez, what a dump.
- Oh, I don't know.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.276
It's better than some
of the restaurants Al's taken me to.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.792
Jefferson, I still don't understand
why you have to dress like that.

14:27.600 --> 14:32.230
I'm a pillar of the community, Marcie.
I shouldn't be seen in places like this.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.678
- Oh, hi, Jefferson.
- Hello, Mai Lin.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.349
That's a relief.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.949
I thought I was the only
dry-cleaner security guard...

14:44.160 --> 14:45.957
...working undercover tonight.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.235
Gee, Al, I can't believe you spend time
in places like this.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.795
I mean, what kind of example is this
for our son?

15:03.320 --> 15:04.992
I gotta go.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.516
Another emergency bypass,
Dr. Bundy?

15:10.120 --> 15:14.272
Yes. Yes, it appears my beeper has
just gone off.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.952
Also.

15:23.040 --> 15:23.995
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.513
"Good evening, patrons.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.191
And welcome to the Jiggly Room...

15:33.400 --> 15:35.470
...where we present the finest...

15:35.680 --> 15:38.990
...in yada-yada-yada.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.519
Our first A-cup tonight
is a delectable little dish...

15:44.720 --> 15:47.917
...we like to call Shay Shay."

15:57.240 --> 15:59.834
Now, let's see. Where did we
leave off last week?

16:00.080 --> 16:02.878
We were discussing
health-care reform, I believe.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.918
Oh, yes. I think...

16:06.400 --> 16:08.755
Oh, excuse me, ma'am,
I believe you dropped this.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.789
We were weighing the benefits
of medical malpractice torts...

16:15.000 --> 16:19.357
...against across-the-board
employer insurance contributions.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.833
Yes. I'd like a bowl...

16:22.040 --> 16:25.794
...of your freshest
air-popped popcorn, please.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.993
And I'd like an unflavoured
mineral water with a lemon wedge.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.112
Two beers.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.635
Gee, Al, I have to admit...

16:36.840 --> 16:39.354
...this isn't anything
like I thought it would be.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.028
I know. Usually it's a little more
civilized in here...

16:42.280 --> 16:46.398
...but when talk turns to health care,
damn it, I become an animal!

16:57.920 --> 17:00.992
Ginger or Mary Ann?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.478
Mary Ann.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.950
Gilligan or Mrs. Howell?

17:10.640 --> 17:13.313
Well, that depends. How long
we been on this island?

17:13.560 --> 17:16.233
Al, we have to apologize.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.954
I really thought you came down here
to ogle these women.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.435
But if this is how you're gonna act,
you can have it. Come on, girls.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.835
Oh, no, no, Peg.
No, now wait a minute here.

17:25.040 --> 17:29.716
Don't go. Ike is about to start
a conversation on auto repair.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.356
Now you just stay seated here,
the night's still young.

17:33.600 --> 17:38.515
"And now, the Jiggly Room
presents a very special treat.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.115
She is usually here on Saturdays...

17:41.320 --> 17:44.835
...but this week
she'll be getting married.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.352
To me.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.518
And here she is, the two,
the only Rocki Mountains."

18:12.520 --> 18:14.875
Oh, my God.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.713
Helen, you still here?

18:21.680 --> 18:23.238
Go home.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.236
Would someone please tell me
who on earth would find that sexy?

18:45.920 --> 18:48.878
Men, get ahold of yourselves.
Get a grip.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.351
Who's man enough
to climb the Rockies?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.558
I can't take it anymore!

18:56.760 --> 18:59.479
It's party time!

19:04.880 --> 19:08.873
Boy, Louise is gonna kill him
when he gets home, huh, Helen?

19:20.640 --> 19:25.236
Hey, Al, you think the wives will ever
let us come back to this place again?

19:28.520 --> 19:32.354
It'll be where they dump the bodies
after they gut us in our sleep.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.035
We can't go on dancing
like this forever.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.912
What'll we do?

19:37.120 --> 19:39.634
What we all know we have to do.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.032
- You mean...?
- I'm afraid so.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.640
Oh, Charlie.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.599
Oh, Ike.

19:52.160 --> 19:55.038
Oh, Bob Rooney.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.913
Oh, Al.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.952
Oh, Mr. Lincoln.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.592
Hey, buddy...

20:09.960 --> 20:12.793
...you up for the Jiggly Room
tonight?

20:14.080 --> 20:17.231
No, Jefferson, I'm all jigglied out.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.796
Hey, guys, guess what it's time for.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.911
Armageddon?

20:25.760 --> 20:29.753
No, better. It is the world premiere
of my Waist Away Diet commercial.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.190
Man, when people see my face
in this commercial...

20:32.400 --> 20:36.029
...the offers are gonna rain down
like halves and pogs.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.994
I'm... I'm gonna be huge.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.998
Will Waist Away work for you?

20:42.240 --> 20:44.595
Ask former heavyweight,
Diane Graham.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.751
Other diets let me down.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.633
So I tried Waist Away.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.113
And, baby, look at me now.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.356
That's not my head.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.870
They didn't use my head.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.790
And remember,
I'm not just a Waist Away client...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.117
...I'm the president
of the company's daughter.

21:15.680 --> 21:21.789
Now, now, pumpkin, you know
that life is full of little setbacks. Now...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.275
You... You just have
to stand tall and...

21:24.480 --> 21:28.189
And learn to face them
with courage and... And dignity, huh?

21:29.400 --> 21:34.838
Oh, Al, look what we got
at the Hungry Undie?

21:38.880 --> 21:41.440
Your favourite, Jefferson.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.955
Butterscotch.

21:44.305 --> 21:50.775
