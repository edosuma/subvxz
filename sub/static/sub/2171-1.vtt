01:28.673 --> 01:29.798
Bing!

03:07.104 --> 03:09.939
Maycomb was a tired old town

03:10.107 --> 03:12.776
even in 1932 when
I first knew it.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.321
Somehow, it was hotter then.

03:17.698 --> 03:21.159
Men's stiff collars wilted
by 9:00 in the morning.

03:21.285 --> 03:25.622
Ladies bathed before noon,
after their 3:00 naps

03:26.290 --> 03:28.917
and by nightfall
were like soft teacakes

03:29.001 --> 03:31.544
with frostings of sweat
and sweet talcum.

03:33.297 --> 03:37.300
A day was 24 hours long,
but it seemed longer.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.763
There was no hurry, for there was
nowhere to go and nothing to buy

03:41.847 --> 03:43.681
and no money to buy it with.

03:43.808 --> 03:46.017
Although Maycomb County
had recently been told

03:46.143 --> 03:48.311
that it had nothing to
fear but fear itself.

03:50.356 --> 03:52.816
That summer I was 6 years old.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.068
Good morning,
Mr. Cunningham.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.736
Good morning, miss.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.321
My daddy's
getting dressed.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.323
Would you like me
to call him for you?

04:00.825 --> 04:02.617
No, miss,
I don't care to bother.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.744
Why, it's no bother,
Mr. Cunningham.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.329
He'll be happy
to see you.

04:06.664 --> 04:07.831
Atticus.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.418
Atticus!

04:12.086 --> 04:13.837
Here's Mr. Cunningham.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.382
Good morning, Walter.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.091
Good morning,
Mr. Finch.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.511
I didn't want to
bother you none.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.722
I brought you these hickory
nuts as part of my entailment.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.934
Thank you. The collards we had
last week were delicious.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.395
Well, morning.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.355
Morning, Walter.

04:36.694 --> 04:40.572
Scout, I think maybe next
time Mr. Cunningham comes,

04:41.282 --> 04:42.740
you'd better not call me.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.534
I thought you'd
want to thank him.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.869
Oh, I do.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.413
But I think it embarrasses
him to be thanked.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.504
Why does he bring you
all this stuff?

04:56.589 --> 04:59.132
He is paying me for some
legal work I did for him.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.134
Why is he paying
you like this?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.720
That's the only way he can.
He has no money.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.097
- Is he poor?
- Yes.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.518
Are we poor?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.770
We are, indeed.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.190
Are we as poor as
the Cunninghams?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.567
No, not exactly.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.695
The Cunninghams are
country folks, farmers.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.239
The Crash hit them
the hardest.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.868
Scout,
call your brother.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.871
Atticus,
Jem's up in the tree.

05:30.206 --> 05:32.332
He says he won't come
down until you agree

05:32.416 --> 05:33.917
to play football
for the Methodists.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.339
Jem?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.511
Son, why don't you come
on down out of there now

05:44.595 --> 05:46.554
and have your breakfast?

05:46.931 --> 05:49.474
Calpurnia has a good one.
Hot biscuits.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.683
No, sir.

05:50.768 --> 05:53.061
Not until you agree to play
football for the Methodists.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.687
Son, I can't do that.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.273
I explained to you, I'm
too old to get out there.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.610
After all, I'm the
only father you have.

06:00.945 --> 06:03.988
You wouldn't want me to go and get
my head knocked off, would you?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.615
I ain't coming down.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.493
Suit yourself.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.083
Morning.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.210
Good morning,
Miss Maudie.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.962
What's going on
over there?

06:19.463 --> 06:21.798
I'm having a terrible
time, Miss Maudie.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.550
Jem's staying
up in the tree

06:23.634 --> 06:26.052
until Atticus agrees to play
football for the Methodists

06:26.929 --> 06:29.305
and Atticus says
he's too old.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.767
Every time I want him to do
something, he's too old.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.811
He's too old
for anything.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.313
He can do plenty of things.

06:37.982 --> 06:40.316
You be good, children.
Mind Cal.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.194
Good morning, Maudie.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.612
Good morning, Atticus.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.156
He won't let me have a gun

06:47.366 --> 06:50.785
and he'll only play touch
football with me, never tackle.

06:51.996 --> 06:55.665
He can make somebody's will so
airtight you can't break it.

06:56.709 --> 07:00.295
You count your blessings and
stop complaining, both of you.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.298
Thank your stars he has
the sense to act his age.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.883
Jem, he is pretty old.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.594
I can't help that.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.141
Hey.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.688
Hey, yourself.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.524
I'm Charles Baker Harris.
I can read.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.236
You got anything that needs
reading, I can do it.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.531
How old are you?
Four-and-a-half?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.116
Going on seven.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.576
No wonder, then.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.953
Scout's been reading
since she was born,

07:34.038 --> 07:36.205
and she don't start
school till next month.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.500
You look right puny
for going on seven.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.919
I'm little, but I'm old.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.883
Folks call me Dill.
I'm from Meridian, Mississippi

07:47.217 --> 07:50.428
and I'm spending two weeks next
door with my aunt Stephanie.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.431
My mama worked for a
photographer in Meridian.

07:53.932 --> 07:58.561
She entered my picture in the Beautiful
Child contest and won $5 on it.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.938
She gave the money to me

08:01.023 --> 08:03.900
and I went to the picture
show 20 times with it.

08:04.568 --> 08:08.071
Our mama's dead but we've got a daddy.
Where's your daddy?

08:08.781 --> 08:10.239
I haven't got one.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.283
Is he dead?

08:12.660 --> 08:13.826
No.

08:14.662 --> 08:15.870
Well...

08:16.038 --> 08:19.123
Well, if he's not dead,
you've got one, haven't you?

08:22.586 --> 08:23.961
Hush, Scout.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.299
What did I do?
What did I do?

08:30.219 --> 08:33.096
Uh, Dill,
this is Calpurnia.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.181
Pleased to know you,
Dill.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.265
Pleased to know you.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.559
My daddy owns
the L and N Railroad.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.147
He's going to let me run the
engine all the way to New Orleans.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.440
Is that so?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.821
- He says I can invite anybody...
- Shh.

08:54.118 --> 08:57.453
There goes the meanest man that
ever took a breath of life.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.917
Why is he
the meanest man?

09:04.294 --> 09:06.629
Well, for one thing,

09:07.798 --> 09:09.507
he has a boy named Boo

09:10.259 --> 09:13.010
that he keeps chained to a bed
in the house over yonder.

09:16.765 --> 09:17.807
Come on.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.814
See, he lives
over there.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.859
Boo only comes
out at night

09:27.943 --> 09:30.319
when you're asleep
and it's pitch dark.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.614
When you wake up at night,
you can hear him.

09:33.699 --> 09:36.033
Once I heard him scratching
on our screen door

09:36.160 --> 09:38.828
but he was gone by the
time Atticus got there.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.331
I wonder what
he does in there.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.168
I wonder what he looks like.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.128
Well,

09:48.338 --> 09:52.175
judging from his tracks,
he's about 6'6" tall.

09:52.676 --> 09:56.345
He eats raw squirrels and
all the cats he can catch.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.683
There's a long, jagged scar that
runs all the way across his face.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.186
His teeth are
yellow and rotten.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.606
His eyes are popped, and he
drools most of the time.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.693
Oh, I don't believe you.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.362
Dill, what are you
doing here?

10:13.447 --> 10:16.365
My Lord, Aunt Stephanie!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.951
Dill, I don't want you playing
around that house over there.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.204
There's a maniac lives
there and he's dangerous.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.413
See?

10:22.498 --> 10:25.500
I was just trying to warn him about Boo.
He wouldn't believe me.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.877
You'd just better believe
him, Mr. Dill Harris.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.213
Tell him about the time Boo
tried to kill his papa.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.964
I was standing
in my yard one day

10:32.049 --> 10:34.550
when his mama come out yelling,
"He's killing us all."

10:34.635 --> 10:36.969
Turned out that Boo was
sitting in the living room

10:37.054 --> 10:38.387
cutting up the paper
for his scrapbook,

10:38.472 --> 10:39.889
and when his daddy
come by,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.225
he reached over with his scissors,
stabbed him in his leg,

10:42.309 --> 10:44.560
pulled them out and went
right on cutting the paper.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.479
They wanted to send
him to an asylum.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.565
But his daddy said, "No Radley
is going to any asylum."

10:49.650 --> 10:52.235
So they locked him up in the
basement of the courthouse

10:52.361 --> 10:53.986
till he nearly
died of the damp,

10:54.071 --> 10:55.696
and his daddy
brought him back home.

10:56.073 --> 10:59.575
There he is, to this day, sitting
over there with his scissors.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.911
Lord knows what
he's doing or thinking.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.252
Six, seven, eight,

11:09.753 --> 11:12.380
nine, ten.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.928
Come on, Scout.
It's 5:00.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.684
Where are you going?

11:24.768 --> 11:26.519
Time to meet Atticus.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.187
Why do you call
your daddy Atticus?

11:28.272 --> 11:29.772
Because Jem does.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.274
But why does he?

11:31.358 --> 11:34.861
I don't know. He just started
to ever since he began talking.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.449
Wait, stop.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.119
Mrs. Dubose is
on her porch.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.581
Listen, no matter what she says
to you, don't answer her back.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.792
There's a Confederate pistol
in her lap under her shawl

11:49.877 --> 11:53.546
and she'll kill you as quick
as look at you. Come on.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.472
Hey, Mrs. Dubose.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.808
Don't you say "hey"
to me, you ugly girl.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.644
You say, "Good afternoon,
Mrs. Dubose."

12:09.229 --> 12:11.731
You come over here
when I'm talking to you.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.024
You come over here...

12:13.108 --> 12:14.734
Hey, Atticus.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.736
- You listen to me...
- Atticus, this is Dill.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.987
How do you do, Dill?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.156
Don't your daddy
teach you to respect old people?

12:20.282 --> 12:23.117
You come back here,
Jean Louise Finch!

12:23.994 --> 12:25.953
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Dubose.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.497
My!

12:29.166 --> 12:31.417
You look like a picture
this afternoon.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.669
He don't say
a picture of what.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.297
My goodness gracious,
look at your flowers.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.008
Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

12:39.676 --> 12:42.511
Mrs. Dubose, the
gardens at Bellingrath

12:42.596 --> 12:44.639
have nothing to compare
with your flowers.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.768
I don't think they're
as nice as last year.

12:48.852 --> 12:49.936
I can't agree with you.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.312
He gets her interested
in something nice

12:51.396 --> 12:52.396
so she forgets
being mean.

12:52.481 --> 12:56.192
I think your yard is going to
be the showplace of this town.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.443
Well...

12:57.861 --> 12:59.487
Grand seeing you,
Mrs. Dubose.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.044
"I had two cats

13:15.295 --> 13:18.047
"which I brought ashore

13:18.298 --> 13:20.633
"on my first raft.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.804
"And I had a dog."

13:27.182 --> 13:29.976
Atticus, do you think
Boo Radley ever really

13:30.060 --> 13:32.436
comes and looks in
my window at night?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.480
Jem says he does.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.315
This afternoon when we were
over by their house...

13:36.400 --> 13:37.525
Scout.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.570
I told you and Jem to leave
those poor people alone.

13:43.073 --> 13:46.242
I want you to stay away from their
house and stop tormenting them.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.077
Yes, sir.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.580
I think that's all the reading for
tonight, honey. It's getting late.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.040
What time is it?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.583
8:30.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.794
May I see your watch?

14:15.981 --> 14:18.315
"To Atticus,
my beloved husband."

14:20.861 --> 14:24.405
Atticus, Jem says this watch is
going to belong to him someday.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.740
That's right.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.366
Why?

14:28.785 --> 14:29.785
Well,

14:30.495 --> 14:33.330
it's customary for the boy
to have his father's watch.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.876
What are you going
to give me?

14:41.256 --> 14:44.592
I don't know that I have much
else of value that belongs to me.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.889
But there's
a pearl necklace,

14:51.099 --> 14:53.100
there's a ring that
belonged to your mother.

14:54.227 --> 14:58.147
And I've put them away,
and they're to be yours.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.116
Good night, Scout.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.493
Good night.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.088
- Good night, Jem.
- Good night.

15:35.519 --> 15:36.602
Jem?

15:36.686 --> 15:37.812
Yeah.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.527
How old was I
when Mama died?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.195
Two.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.781
And how old were you?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.157
Six.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.451
As old as I am now?

15:52.536 --> 15:53.619
Mmm-hmm.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.665
Was Mama pretty?

15:58.208 --> 15:59.333
Mmm-hmm.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.128
Was Mama nice?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.214
Mmm-hmm.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.467
Did you love her?

16:09.678 --> 16:10.761
Yeah.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.388
Did I love her?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.557
Yeah.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.186
Do you miss her?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.563
Mmm-hmm

16:30.157 --> 16:31.866
Evening, Atticus.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.409
Good evening, Judge.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.206
Rather warm, isn't it?

16:39.457 --> 16:40.875
Yes, indeed.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.465
How's Mrs. Taylor?

16:48.550 --> 16:50.217
She's fine, thank you.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.391
Atticus, you've heard
about Tom Robinson?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.144
Yes, sir.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.356
Grand jury will get around
to charging him tomorrow.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.907
I was thinking about appointing
you to take his case.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.832
I realize you're very busy
these days with your practice

17:23.292 --> 17:26.295
and your children need
a great deal of your time.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.007
Yes, sir.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.598
I'll take the case.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.853
I'll send a boy over for you
tomorrow, when his hearing comes up.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.608
Well, uh,

17:48.401 --> 17:49.652
I'll see you tomorrow,
Atticus.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.945
Yes, sir.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.741
And thank you.

17:56.785 --> 17:57.868
Yes, sir.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.672
Hey, Jem.

18:10.131 --> 18:13.259
I bet you a Gray Ghost
against two Tom Swifts

18:14.010 --> 18:17.388
you wouldn't go any farther
than Boo Radley's gate.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.435
You're scared to,
ain't you?

18:23.520 --> 18:24.687
I ain't scared.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.357
I go past Boo Radley's house
nearly every day of my life.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.900
Always running.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.735
You hush up, Scout.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.491
Come on, Dill.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.868
Me first!

18:40.036 --> 18:41.537
You gotta let
Dill be first.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.830
No, me.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.498
Let her be first.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.002
All right, get in.
Hurry up.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.461
All right.

18:50.672 --> 18:51.797
You ready?

18:51.881 --> 18:53.507
Uh-huh. Let her go.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.773
Scout!

19:15.030 --> 19:18.115
Scout, get away from there!
Scout, come on!

19:19.492 --> 19:21.827
Scout, don't just
lie there. Get up!

19:26.082 --> 19:27.374
Come on, Scout.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.552
Run for your life, Scout!
Come on, Dill.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.729
Now who's a coward?

19:48.813 --> 19:53.067
You tell them about this back in
Meridian County, Mr. Dill Harris.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.362
I'll tell you
what let's do.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.280
Let's go down
to the courthouse

19:58.365 --> 20:00.074
and see the room
they locked Boo up in.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.159
My aunt says
it's bat-infested,

20:02.243 --> 20:03.827
and he nearly died
from the mildew.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.996
Come on,
I bet they've got chains

20:06.081 --> 20:07.956
and instruments of
torture down there.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.209
Come on.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.046
Young Finch.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.173
Yes, sir.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.883
If you're looking
for your daddy,

20:17.967 --> 20:19.551
he's inside
the courthouse.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.053
Thank you, sir, but we're
not looking for...

20:21.137 --> 20:23.138
Thank you,
Mr. Townsend, sir.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.518
What is your daddy doing
in the courthouse?

20:27.602 --> 20:29.937
He's a lawyer
and he has a case.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.564
The grand jury is charging
his client today.

20:32.816 --> 20:36.026
I heard something about it last
night when Judge Taylor came over.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.319
Let's go watch.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.654
No, Dill.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.364
He wouldn't like that.

20:40.448 --> 20:41.490
Dill!

20:44.702 --> 20:46.412
Dill, wait a minute.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.710
- Is that the courtroom?
- Yeah.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.337
Shh.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.551
I can't see anything.

21:00.635 --> 21:01.635
Shh.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.056
You all lift me up so I
can see what's going on.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.767
All right.
Make a saddle, Scout.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.441
Not much is happening.

21:17.152 --> 21:19.486
The judge looks
like he's asleep.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.741
I see your daddy
and a colored man.

21:25.702 --> 21:26.660
The colored man...

21:26.744 --> 21:27.744
Shh.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.914
The colored man looks
to me like he's crying.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.249
And I've seen him...

21:32.333 --> 21:34.543
I wonder what he's
done to cry about.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.628
What's going on?

21:37.213 --> 21:41.133
There's a whole lot of men
sitting together on one side

21:41.718 --> 21:44.761
and one man keeps pointing at
the colored man and yelling.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.474
They're taking
the colored man away.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.267
Where's Atticus?

21:52.270 --> 21:54.605
I can't see
your daddy now, either.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.776
I wonder where
in the world...

21:59.861 --> 22:01.236
Scout, Jem.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.573
What in the world
are you doing here?

22:04.949 --> 22:06.241
Hello, Atticus.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.369
What are you
doing here?

22:10.121 --> 22:13.457
We came down to find out where
Boo Radley was locked up.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.417
We wanted to
see the bats.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.046
I want you all
back home right away.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.172
Yes, sir.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.465
Run along, now.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.676
I'll see you there
for dinner.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.564
Hey, Atticus.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.776
Mr. Ewell.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.154
Captain, I'm real sorry
they picked you

22:44.239 --> 22:46.657
to defend that nigger
that raped my Mayella.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.867
I don't know why
I didn't kill him myself

22:48.952 --> 22:50.702
instead of going
to the sheriff.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.788
That would've saved
you and the sheriff

22:52.872 --> 22:54.331
and the taxpayers
lots of trouble.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.958
Excuse me, Mr. Ewell,
I'm very busy.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.670
Hey, captain, somebody
told me just now that

23:00.505 --> 23:04.841
they thought that you believed Tom
Robinson's story against ours.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.636
And you know
what I said?

23:09.806 --> 23:12.641
I said, "You're wrong, man.
You're dead wrong.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.102
"Mr. Finch ain't taking
his story against ours."

23:17.272 --> 23:18.564
They was wrong,
wasn't they?

23:18.648 --> 23:21.108
I've been appointed
to defend Tom Robinson.

23:21.192 --> 23:24.027
And now that he's been charged,
that's what I intend to do.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.196
You're taking his...

23:26.281 --> 23:27.823
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Ewell.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.997
What kind of man are you?

23:35.707 --> 23:37.583
You've got children
of your own.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.882
Hey, Jem.

23:46.342 --> 23:47.467
Jem?

23:57.645 --> 24:00.731
I think we ought to stay right
here in Miss Stephanie's yard.

24:00.815 --> 24:04.067
You don't have to come
along, Angel Mae.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.208
What are you going to do?

24:22.253 --> 24:24.880
We're going to look in the
window at the Radley house

24:24.964 --> 24:27.424
and see if we can get
a look at Boo Radley.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.426
Come on, Dill.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.557
Jem, please,
I'm scared.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.059
Then go home
if you're scared!

24:37.143 --> 24:39.519
I swear, Scout, you act more
like a girl all the time.

24:39.604 --> 24:40.646
Come on, Dill.

24:40.730 --> 24:41.730
Wait for me.
I'm coming.

24:41.814 --> 24:42.898
Shh.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.656
We'll go around back,

24:50.740 --> 24:53.325
crawl under the high wire fence
at the rear of the Radley lot.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.453
I don't believe we can
be seen from there.

24:57.705 --> 24:58.789
Shh.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.466
Come on.

25:23.564 --> 25:24.690
Come on.

25:27.735 --> 25:28.985
Come on.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.033
Come on, help me.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.123
Shh.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.386
Don't make a sound.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.312
Spit on it.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.693
All right.

26:15.158 --> 26:16.867
- Jem...
- Shh.

26:17.368 --> 26:18.493
Spit some more.

26:23.624 --> 26:24.750
All right.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.648
Come on.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.638
Hurry.

28:45.766 --> 28:46.975
Hurry.

28:58.779 --> 28:59.821
Scout.

29:01.449 --> 29:02.657
Scout.

29:30.853 --> 29:32.312
Quick.
Come over here.

29:38.069 --> 29:40.445
Shh. Shh. Quiet.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.744
What are you going
to do for pants, Jem?

29:47.828 --> 29:49.245
I don't know.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.833
Dill?

29:55.086 --> 29:56.127
Dill!

29:56.212 --> 29:57.879
You come on in, now.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.090
Shh.

30:00.341 --> 30:01.800
I'd better go.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.009
Dill?

30:03.469 --> 30:04.970
Coming, Aunt Stephanie.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.348
So long.
I'll see you next summer.

30:08.516 --> 30:09.891
- So long.
- So long.

30:10.977 --> 30:11.977
Dill?

30:12.061 --> 30:13.144
I'm coming.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.064
I'm going back
after my pants.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.108
Please, Jem,
come on in the house.

30:18.192 --> 30:20.068
I can't go in
without my pants.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.529
Then I'm going
to call Atticus.

30:22.613 --> 30:23.989
No, you're not.

30:24.073 --> 30:27.242
Now, listen. Atticus ain't never
whipped me since I can remember

30:27.326 --> 30:29.327
and I plan to
keep it that way.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.454
Then I'm going with you.

30:31.539 --> 30:32.580
You ain't.

30:32.665 --> 30:36.084
You stay right here.
I'll be back before you can count to 10.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.630
Jem.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.264
One, two,

30:51.267 --> 30:53.101
three, four...

30:53.853 --> 30:55.311
Jem.

30:56.397 --> 30:59.107
Scout. Come on in.

31:01.444 --> 31:05.780
Five, six, seven,

31:06.574 --> 31:11.411
eight, nine, ten,

31:14.123 --> 31:17.125
eleven, twelve,

31:18.294 --> 31:21.087
thirteen, fourteen.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.722
Jem.

31:30.806 --> 31:31.848
Shh.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.351
Shh.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.318
What was that?

31:43.819 --> 31:48.156
What is it? What happened?

31:48.824 --> 31:51.159
What's going on?
What is it?

31:51.952 --> 31:53.495
Atticus, what is it?

31:54.497 --> 31:57.499
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

31:59.001 --> 32:03.755
Mr. Radley shot at a prowler
out in his collard patch.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.673
A prowler? Oh, Maudie!

32:05.800 --> 32:08.426
Whoever it was won't
be back anytime soon.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.762
Mr. Radley must've scared
them out of their wits.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.180
- Good night.
- Good night.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.431
Good night, Atticus.

32:13.516 --> 32:15.475
Scared the living
daylights out of me.

32:15.768 --> 32:18.645
I swear, a prowler.
He said a prowler.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.192
Come on, now.
The excitement is over. Time for bed.

32:26.695 --> 32:27.821
Scout, Jem.

32:47.550 --> 32:48.675
Morning.

32:50.219 --> 32:51.344
Good morning, Miss Maudie.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.512
Morning, Calpurnia.

32:53.097 --> 32:55.890
I came to see Jean Louise ready
for her first day at school.

32:56.058 --> 32:57.392
- Scout.
- Morning, Mrs. Maudie.

32:57.518 --> 32:58.893
- All ready for school?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.228
Scout!

33:00.896 --> 33:02.856
What are you going to do
with yourself this morning

33:02.940 --> 33:04.732
with both children
at school?

33:04.859 --> 33:07.485
I don't know,
and that's the truth.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.779
I was thinking
about that just now.

33:10.698 --> 33:11.906
Scout?

33:13.909 --> 33:16.244
Scout? Scout!

33:18.289 --> 33:20.623
Did you hear me, Scout?
Now, hurry.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.845
Hey, everybody,
look at Scout.

33:33.929 --> 33:34.929
Shh.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.478
Come on in here, Scout.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.317
Have your breakfast.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.995
I think your dress is
mighty becoming, honey.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.789
Now don't go
tugging at that dress, Scout.

34:01.999 --> 34:05.084
You want to have it all wrinkled
before you even get to school?

34:06.587 --> 34:10.505
I still don't see why I have
to wear a darn old dress.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.007
You'll get used to it.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.842
- I'm ready.
- Oh, Jem.

34:14.511 --> 34:15.803
Jem...

34:17.097 --> 34:19.431
It's half an hour
before school starts.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.686
Sit back down and
wait for your sister.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.275
Well, hurry up, Scout.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.360
I'm trying to.

34:32.112 --> 34:35.447
Come on. It's your first day.
You want to be late?

34:38.786 --> 34:40.536
- I'm ready.
- Come on, let's go.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.458
Bye.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.005
Bye, bye.

35:06.397 --> 35:07.939
Darn you,
Walter Cunningham!

35:13.862 --> 35:16.698
Come on, Walter!

35:18.826 --> 35:22.161
Cut that out!
What do you think you're doing?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.334
He made me start off
on the wrong foot!

35:28.419 --> 35:30.878
I was trying to explain
to that darn lady teacher

35:31.005 --> 35:35.008
why he didn't have no money for
his lunch and she got sore at me.

35:36.427 --> 35:39.846
Stop it! Stop it!

35:47.771 --> 35:50.356
Is your daddy Mr. Walter
Cunningham from Old Sarum?

35:53.402 --> 35:56.946
Come home and have dinner with us, Walter.
We'd be glad to have you.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.326
Our daddy's a friend
of your daddy's.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.998
Scout here is crazy.
She won't fight you no more.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.129
I hope that's
a dinner that you enjoy.

36:14.256 --> 36:17.425
Yes, sir. I don't know
when I've had a roast.

36:18.010 --> 36:21.679
We've been having squirrels
and rabbits lately.

36:22.806 --> 36:26.851
My pa and I go hunting
in our spare time.

36:27.144 --> 36:28.728
You've got a gun
of your own?

36:28.812 --> 36:30.313
Uh-huh.

36:30.773 --> 36:32.231
How long have you had a gun?

36:32.316 --> 36:33.775
A year or so.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.363
Can I have the syrup,
please?

36:38.447 --> 36:39.572
Certainly, son.

36:39.656 --> 36:43.117
Cal. Will you bring in
the syrup dish, please?

36:43.327 --> 36:44.452
Yes, sir.

36:45.037 --> 36:47.789
How old were you when you got
your first gun, Atticus?

36:48.665 --> 36:50.208
Thirteen or fourteen.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.963
I remember when my daddy
gave me that gun.

36:57.341 --> 37:00.551
He told me that I should never
point at anything in the house.

37:01.220 --> 37:04.722
And that he'd rather I'd shoot
at tin cans in the backyard.

37:05.641 --> 37:08.601
But he said that sooner or later
he'd suppose the temptation

37:08.685 --> 37:10.895
to go after birds
would be too much.

37:12.523 --> 37:16.859
That I could shoot all the blue
jays I wanted if I could hit them.

37:17.986 --> 37:21.322
But to remember it was a sin
to kill a mockingbird.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.157
Why?

37:24.034 --> 37:26.369
I reckon because mockingbirds

37:26.995 --> 37:30.081
don't do anything but
make music for us to enjoy.

37:32.835 --> 37:36.587
They don't eat people's gardens,
don't nest in the corncribs.

37:37.923 --> 37:41.384
They don't do one thing, but just
sing their hearts out for us.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.013
How did you like school,
Scout?

37:46.890 --> 37:48.182
All right.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.686
Thank you, Cal.
That's for Walter.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.711
What in the Sam Hill are you doing...

38:17.045 --> 38:20.256
But, Atticus, he's gone and
drowned his dinner in syrup

38:20.382 --> 38:22.884
and now he's pouring it
all over.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.802
Scout.

38:24.887 --> 38:25.970
What?

38:26.054 --> 38:27.889
Come out here.
I want to talk to you.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.691
That boy is your company

38:38.901 --> 38:42.069
and if he wants to eat up that
tablecloth, you'll let him, you hear?

38:42.738 --> 38:44.822
And if you can't act
fit to eat like folks,

38:44.907 --> 38:47.074
you can just sit here
and eat in the kitchen.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.579
Scout.

38:57.211 --> 38:58.419
Scout.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.428
Scout, what in the world
has got into you?

39:08.263 --> 39:09.305
Not going back.

39:09.389 --> 39:10.431
Now, now.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.849
Not going back.

39:14.269 --> 39:17.355
Atticus, I'm not going
back to school anymore.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.732
Scout,
it's just the first day.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.360
I don't care.
Everything went wrong.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.863
My teacher got mad
as the devil at me

39:25.948 --> 39:29.951
and said you were teaching me to
read all wrong, and to stop it.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.036
Then acted like a fool

39:32.120 --> 39:34.372
and tried to give
Walter Cunningham a quarter

39:34.456 --> 39:38.376
when everybody knows Cunninghams
won't take nothing from nobody.

39:38.961 --> 39:41.295
Any fool could have
told her that.

39:41.463 --> 39:42.630
Well...

39:42.714 --> 39:44.131
Maybe she's just nervous.

39:44.258 --> 39:46.133
After all,
it's her first day, too,

39:46.218 --> 39:48.052
teaching school
and being new here.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.220
Oh, Atticus.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.305
Now, wait a minute.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.894
If you just learn
a single trick, Scout,

39:56.979 --> 39:59.647
you'll get along a lot better
with all kinds of folks.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.233
You never really
understand a person

40:02.317 --> 40:05.236
until you consider things
from his point of view.

40:05.487 --> 40:06.612
Sir?

40:07.114 --> 40:11.117
Until you climb inside of his
skin and walk around in it.

40:11.660 --> 40:15.580
But if I keep going to school,
we can't ever read anymore.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.377
Scout?

40:22.921 --> 40:25.131
Do you know what
a compromise is?

40:27.009 --> 40:28.676
Bending the law?

40:31.096 --> 40:32.221
Uh...

40:32.681 --> 40:37.018
No. It's an agreement
reached by mutual consent.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.897
Here is the way it works.

40:44.985 --> 40:48.654
You concede the necessity
of going to school

40:50.324 --> 40:53.367
and we'll keep right on
reading the same every night,

40:54.161 --> 40:56.162
just as we always have.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.166
Is that a bargain?

41:00.167 --> 41:00.833
Is that a bargain?

41:03.754 --> 41:07.882
There just didn't
seem to be anyone or anything

41:08.216 --> 41:10.051
Atticus couldn't explain.

41:10.719 --> 41:12.637
Though it wasn't a talent
that would arouse

41:12.721 --> 41:14.597
the admiration of
any of our friends,

41:14.723 --> 41:17.433
Jem and I had to admit
he was very good at that.

41:18.352 --> 41:21.687
But that was all he was
good at, we thought.

41:23.273 --> 41:24.732
See, there he is!

41:35.285 --> 41:37.912
Scout, Jem,
come on inside.

41:39.289 --> 41:40.956
Come on, get in.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.801
Mr. Finch? This is Cal.

41:51.968 --> 41:54.845
I swear to God, there's a mad
dog down the street apiece.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.263
He's coming this way.

42:04.898 --> 42:06.065
There he is.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.154
He's got it all right,
Mr. Finch.

42:16.076 --> 42:18.160
Stay inside, Son.
Keep him in there, Cal.

42:19.788 --> 42:21.789
He's within range, Heck.

42:23.834 --> 42:25.209
Take him, Mr. Finch.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.545
No, Mr. Tate.
He can't shoot.

42:27.629 --> 42:28.671
Don't waste time.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.172
For God's sake,
Mr. Finch,

42:30.257 --> 42:32.383
he's got to be killed right
away, before he starts running.

42:32.467 --> 42:35.386
Look where he is.
I can't shoot that well. You know it.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.179
I haven't
shot a gun in years.

42:37.264 --> 42:39.432
I'd feel mighty comfortable
if you did now.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.196
Don't go near that dog,
do you understand?

43:35.322 --> 43:36.947
He's just as dangerous
dead as alive.

43:37.032 --> 43:38.240
Yes, sir.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.452
Atticus?

43:41.536 --> 43:42.828
Yes, Son.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.374
Nothing.

43:47.459 --> 43:49.835
What's the matter, boy?
Can't you talk?

43:49.920 --> 43:52.755
Didn't you know your daddy is
the best shot in this county?

43:52.881 --> 43:55.549
Hush, Heck.
Let's get back to town.

43:55.884 --> 43:57.843
Remember,
don't go near that dog.

43:57.928 --> 43:59.178
Yes, sir.

44:00.472 --> 44:02.765
I'll send Zeebo out
right away to pick him up.

44:23.495 --> 44:25.287
Hey, Atticus.
Can we go with you?

44:26.915 --> 44:27.998
Can we, please?

44:28.083 --> 44:29.124
Can we?

44:29.251 --> 44:32.503
No. I have to go to the country on
business, and you'll just get tired.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.922
No, not me.
I won't get tired.

44:36.758 --> 44:39.218
Promise to stay in the car while I
go in and talk to Helen Robinson?

44:39.302 --> 44:40.344
Mmm-hmm.

44:40.428 --> 44:43.138
And not nag me about leaving
if you do get tired?

44:43.265 --> 44:44.932
All right, climb in.

44:53.608 --> 44:55.401
Who's Helen Robinson?

44:55.485 --> 44:57.278
She's the wife of
the man I'm defending.

45:17.632 --> 45:18.632
Good evening, David.

45:18.717 --> 45:19.800
Evening.

45:20.302 --> 45:21.343
Evening, Helen.

45:21.428 --> 45:22.720
Evening, Mr. Finch.

45:22.804 --> 45:25.055
I came over to tell you
about my visit with Tom.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.765
- Yes, sir.
- And to let you know

45:26.850 --> 45:28.976
that I got a postponement
of the trial.

45:29.311 --> 45:31.687
Give things a chance
to cool down.

46:03.178 --> 46:05.679
Would you tell my daddy
to come out here, please?

46:55.188 --> 46:57.231
You nigger lover.

47:15.667 --> 47:19.086
No need to be afraid of him,
Son. He's all bluff.

47:33.810 --> 47:35.477
Nigger lover!

47:47.323 --> 47:51.326
There's a lot of ugly
things in this world, Son.

47:52.704 --> 47:54.913
I wish I could keep
them all away from you.

47:58.001 --> 47:59.460
That's never possible.

48:02.088 --> 48:05.632
Cal, you wait until I get Scout in bed.
I'll drive you home.

48:05.717 --> 48:06.800
Yes, sir.

48:20.982 --> 48:25.486
Jem, would you mind staying here
with Scout till I get Cal home?

48:25.570 --> 48:26.612
No, sir.

48:27.030 --> 48:28.280
Night, Jem.

48:28.364 --> 48:29.656
Night, Cal.

49:17.664 --> 49:20.124
Atticus! Atticus!

49:21.251 --> 49:22.626
Atticus!

51:01.142 --> 51:04.311
Atticus had
promised me he would wear me out

51:04.395 --> 51:06.480
if he ever heard of
me fighting anymore.

51:07.315 --> 51:10.609
I was far too old and too big
for such childish things

51:10.693 --> 51:13.028
and the sooner
I learned to hold in,

51:13.112 --> 51:15.572
the better off
everybody would be.

51:16.032 --> 51:17.366
I soon forgot.

51:19.202 --> 51:21.536
Cecil Jacobs made me forget.

51:25.375 --> 51:26.625
What is it, Scout?

51:31.798 --> 51:34.132
Atticus,
do you defend niggers?

51:37.470 --> 51:38.845
Don't say "nigger," Scout.

51:38.930 --> 51:40.264
I didn't say it.

51:40.348 --> 51:43.642
Cecil Jacobs did.
That's why I had to fight him.

51:44.435 --> 51:47.104
Scout,
I don't want you fighting.

51:47.730 --> 51:49.564
I had to, Atticus, he...

51:49.649 --> 51:51.608
I don't care what
the reasons are.

51:52.402 --> 51:54.194
I forbid you to fight.

51:55.280 --> 51:56.530
Yes, sir.

52:02.787 --> 52:07.207
Anyway, I'm simply defending
a Negro, Tom Robinson.

52:09.043 --> 52:10.252
Scout,

52:10.461 --> 52:15.007
there are some things that you're not
old enough to understand just yet.

52:17.468 --> 52:22.347
There's been some
high talk around town

52:22.432 --> 52:25.600
to the effect that I shouldn't do
much about defending this man.

52:29.022 --> 52:32.733
If you shouldn't be defending
him, then why are you doing it?

52:38.573 --> 52:40.282
For a number of reasons.

52:42.618 --> 52:45.162
The main one is
that if I didn't,

52:45.246 --> 52:47.664
I couldn't hold
my head up in town.

52:49.042 --> 52:53.754
I couldn't even tell you or Jem
not to do something again.

52:57.550 --> 52:58.884
Oh, Scout.

53:02.555 --> 53:05.349
You're going to hear some ugly
talk about this in school.

53:06.684 --> 53:10.020
But I want you to
promise me one thing,

53:11.314 --> 53:14.024
that you won't get
into fights over it,

53:14.317 --> 53:16.735
no matter what
they say to you.

53:23.618 --> 53:24.701
Yes, sir.

53:39.175 --> 53:40.550
What're you doing?

53:41.052 --> 53:43.470
I'm walking
like an Egyptian.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.514
We were studying
about them in school.

53:46.015 --> 53:48.600
Teacher says we wouldn't
be no place without them.

53:48.684 --> 53:49.810
Is that so?

53:50.436 --> 53:54.356
Cradle of civilization.
They invented embalming and toilet paper.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.403
That's wrong, Scout.

54:02.323 --> 54:05.117
You dig your feet,
this way.

54:06.035 --> 54:07.119
Look, Jem.

54:22.969 --> 54:27.055
Look, the boy wore his hair in
front of his eyebrows like you do.

54:28.266 --> 54:30.600
And the girl
wears bangs like you.

54:31.352 --> 54:32.602
These are us.

55:28.701 --> 55:30.410
Jem, are you awake?

55:30.578 --> 55:31.828
Go back to bed.

55:31.913 --> 55:33.580
I can't go to sleep.

55:34.373 --> 55:35.665
Go back to bed.

55:37.043 --> 55:39.127
What you got in the box?

55:39.212 --> 55:40.754
Nothing. Go back to bed.

55:49.013 --> 55:50.096
Come on.

55:58.439 --> 56:01.775
If I show you, will you swear
never to tell anybody?

56:02.735 --> 56:04.069
I swear.

56:05.196 --> 56:06.571
Cross your heart.

56:28.052 --> 56:29.886
I found all of these

56:30.263 --> 56:33.473
in the knothole of that old
tree at different times.

56:35.893 --> 56:37.310
This is a spelling medal.

56:40.982 --> 56:44.067
They used to award these in
school to spelling winners

56:44.151 --> 56:45.402
before we were born.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.782
And another time
I found this.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.256
And this.

57:20.980 --> 57:22.397
And Scout...

57:24.317 --> 57:26.401
Something else
I never told you about

57:26.485 --> 57:28.528
that night I went back
to the Radley house.

57:28.654 --> 57:32.282
Something else? You never told
me anything about that night.

57:33.659 --> 57:34.868
Well...

57:35.870 --> 57:38.496
You know the first time I was
getting out of my britches?

57:38.581 --> 57:39.789
Uh-huh.

57:39.999 --> 57:43.710
They was all in a tangle,
and I couldn't get them loose.

57:45.713 --> 57:46.880
Well,

57:47.298 --> 57:48.882
when I went back though,

57:50.009 --> 57:51.885
they were folded
across the fence,

57:53.512 --> 57:55.388
sort of like they
was expecting me.

58:03.356 --> 58:05.357
It was to be a long time

58:06.233 --> 58:09.152
before Jem and I
talked about Boo again.

58:12.073 --> 58:15.533
School finally ended
and summer came

58:16.077 --> 58:17.494
and so did Dill.

58:17.578 --> 58:18.536
Good morning.

58:18.621 --> 58:19.829
Good morning.

58:19.914 --> 58:21.998
My, you're up
mighty bright and early.

58:22.750 --> 58:24.501
I've been up since 4:00.

58:24.585 --> 58:26.336
4:00?

58:26.420 --> 58:29.673
Yes. I always get up at 4:00.
It's in my blood.

58:30.508 --> 58:33.927
You see, my daddy was a
railroad man until he got rich.

58:34.178 --> 58:35.762
Now he flies airplanes.

58:36.263 --> 58:39.516
One of these days, he's just going
to swoop down here at Maycomb,

58:39.600 --> 58:41.768
pick me up,
and take me for a ride.

58:51.362 --> 58:53.530
Who's that in the car
with Sheriff Tate?

58:53.614 --> 58:55.281
Tom Robinson, Son.

58:56.450 --> 58:58.076
Where's he been?

58:58.202 --> 58:59.786
In the Abbotsville jail.

59:01.747 --> 59:03.164
Why?

59:03.249 --> 59:05.625
The sheriff thought
he'd be safer there.

59:05.751 --> 59:08.461
They're bringing him
back here tonight,

59:08.546 --> 59:10.797
because his trial
is tomorrow.

59:28.315 --> 59:29.816
Good evening, Heck.

59:29.942 --> 59:31.443
Evening, Mr. Finch.

59:32.653 --> 59:33.737
Come in.

59:38.951 --> 59:40.744
The news has gotten
around the county

59:40.828 --> 59:43.163
about my bringing Tom
Robinson back to the jail.

59:43.831 --> 59:48.168
I heard there might be trouble
from that bunch out at Old Sarum.

59:57.052 --> 01:00:01.389
Cal, if I need you to stay
here tonight, can you do it?

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:03.183
Yes, sir, I can.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.559
Thank you.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.151
I think you'd better
count on staying.

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:15.570
Yes, sir.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.189
What's going on?

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:52.607
Shh. Go back to sleep.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.108
What's going on?

01:00:54.193 --> 01:00:55.235
Shh.

01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:06.412
Hey, there's his car.

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:22.095
See, there he is,
over there.

01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:28.810
No, Scout, don't go to him.
He might not like it.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:33.982
I just wanted to see where he
was and what he was up to.

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:38.486
He's all right.
Let's go back home. Come on.

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:38.713
He in there, Mr. Finch?

01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:43.885
He is. He's asleep.
Don't wake him.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.721
You know what we want.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.143
Get aside from that door,
Mr. Finch.

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:56.189
Walter,

01:02:59.026 --> 01:03:02.153
I think you ought to turn right
around and go back home.

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:04.489
Heck Tate's
around here somewhere.

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:06.157
No, he ain't.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:09.410
Heck and his bunch is out chasing
around Old Sarum looking for us.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.038
We knew he was
so we came in this other way.

01:03:12.164 --> 01:03:14.832
You ain't never thought
about that, had you, Mr. Finch?

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:16.125
I thought about it.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:17.752
I can't see Atticus.

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.047
That changes things...

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.548
Atticus!

01:03:26.679 --> 01:03:27.887
Hey, Atticus.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:31.557
Jem, go home, and take Scout
and Dill home with you.

01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:35.395
Son, I said, go home.

01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:37.563
No, sir.

01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:40.316
I'll send him home!

01:03:40.401 --> 01:03:43.695
Don't you touch him.
Let him go!

01:03:43.904 --> 01:03:45.238
That'll do, Scout.

01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:50.910
Ain't nobody gonna
do Jem that way.

01:03:53.122 --> 01:03:55.289
Now, you get them
out of here, Mr. Finch!

01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:01.129
Jem, I want you
to please leave.

01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:03.923
- No, sir.
- Jem.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:06.592
I tell you,
I ain't going.

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:10.221
Hey, Mr. Cunningham.

01:04:13.142 --> 01:04:15.018
I said, hey,
Mr. Cunningham.

01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:16.936
How's your entailment
getting along?

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:22.984
Don't you remember me,
Mr. Cunningham?

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:26.279
I'm Jean Louise Finch.

01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:32.660
You brought us some hickory nuts
one early morning, remember?

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:35.329
We had a talk.

01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:39.584
I went and got my daddy
to come out and thank you.

01:04:41.128 --> 01:04:44.797
I go to school with your boy.
I go to school with Walter.

01:04:45.424 --> 01:04:49.427
He's a nice boy.
Tell him "hey" for me, won't you?

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.056
You know something,
Mr. Cunningham?

01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:55.641
Entailments are bad.
Entailments...

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:09.655
Atticus, I was just saying to Mr
. Cunningham that entailments were bad

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:14.035
but not to worry.
Takes a long time sometimes.

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:18.039
What's the matter?

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.341
I sure meant no harm,
Mr. Cunningham.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.348
No harm taken, young lady.

01:05:39.645 --> 01:05:41.395
I'll tell Walter
you said "hey."

01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:43.898
Let's clear out of here.

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.860
Let's go, boys.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.765
Now, you go home.
All of you.

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:20.726
I'll be there later.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:24.355
Good luck.

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.066
Come on.

01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:55.553
Mr. Finch, are they gone?

01:06:57.222 --> 01:07:00.266
They've gone.
They won't bother you anymore.

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:23.456
Morning, Mr. Sykes.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.250
- How do you do?
- Ever see so many people?

01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:28.419
Just like on Saturday.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:32.798
Where you going?

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:36.469
I can't stand it any longer. I'm going
downtown to the courthouse to watch.

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:38.888
You'd better not.
You know what Atticus said.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.306
I don't care if he did.

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:42.225
I'm not going to miss
the most exciting thing

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:44.101
that ever happened
in this town.

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:06.666
It's packed solid.
They're standing all along the back.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:10.419
Reverend.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:11.587
Yes?

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:14.173
Reverend Sykes,
are you going upstairs?

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:15.508
Yes, I am.

01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:27.435
Thanks, Brother Jones,
for holding my seat.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.938
Please be seated.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.398
Come on, children.

01:08:30.482 --> 01:08:31.816
It's the Rev.

01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:08.519
This court is now in session.
Everybody rise.

01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:23.367
On the night of August 21,

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:26.871
I was just leaving my office
to go home when Bob...

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:29.707
Mr. Ewell came in.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:35.504
Very excited, he was, and he said to
get to his house as quick as I could,

01:09:36.048 --> 01:09:37.590
that his girl
had been raped.

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:41.551
I got to my car and went out
there as fast as I could.

01:09:43.055 --> 01:09:44.596
She was pretty well
beat up.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:49.560
I asked her if Tom Robinson
beat her like that.

01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:51.937
She said, "Yes, he had."

01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:56.025
I asked if he'd
taken advantage of her.

01:09:57.069 --> 01:09:58.569
She said, "Yes, he did."

01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:01.906
That's all there was to it.

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:05.576
Thank you.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.415
Did anybody
call a doctor, Sheriff?

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.043
- No, sir.
- Why not?

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:17.380
I didn't think
it was necessary.

01:10:17.464 --> 01:10:21.801
She was pretty well beat up.
Something sure happened, it was obvious.

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:27.264
Sheriff, you say she
was mighty beat up.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.600
In what way?

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:31.644
She was beaten
around the head.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:35.439
There were bruises
already coming on her arms.

01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:37.775
She had a black eye
starting.

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:39.944
Which eye?

01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:43.489
Let's see,
it was her left.

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:47.118
Now, was that...

01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:52.915
Was that her left, facing you, or
looking the way that you were?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.461
Yes, that would make it
her right eye.

01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:01.799
It was her right eye,
Mr. Finch. Now I remember.

01:11:02.134 --> 01:11:05.469
She was beaten up on
that side of her face.

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:12.643
Which side, again?

01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:15.020
Her right side.

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.607
She had bruises
on her arms.

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:22.278
And she showed me
her neck.

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:25.156
There were definite finger
marks on her gullet.

01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:30.703
All around

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:34.290
her neck, at the
back of her throat?

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:38.169
I'd say they were
all around.

01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:48.053
The witness may be seated.

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:52.475
Robert E. Lee Ewell.

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:59.148
Place your hand
on the Bible, please.

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:00.983
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.818
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:04.361
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.825
Now, Mr. Ewell,

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:14.914
will you tell us, just in your own
words, what happened on August 21?

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:17.750
Late that night,

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.003
I was coming in from the woods,
with a load of kindling

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:23.923
and I heard Mayella screaming
as I got to the fence.

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:27.301
So, I dropped my kindling and
run just as fast as I could,

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:28.928
but I run into the fence.

01:12:29.888 --> 01:12:31.555
But when I got loose,

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:36.227
I run up to the window, and
I seen him with my Mayella.

01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:45.361
What did you do after
you saw the defendant?

01:12:45.737 --> 01:12:47.780
I ran around the house
trying to get in,

01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.783
but he done run through the
front door, just ahead of me.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:53.285
But I seen who it was,
all right.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:55.621
I seen him!

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.126
And I run in the house

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.130
and poor Mayella was lying
on the floor, squalling.

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:09.093
Then I run for Mr. Tate
as quick as I could.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:11.303
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:13.931
Thank you, Mr. Ewell.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:27.653
Would you mind if I just ask you
a few questions, Mr. Ewell?

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.281
No, sir, Mr. Finch,
I sure wouldn't.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.497
Folks were doing a lot
of running that night.

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:39.748
Let's see, now.

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:43.168
You say that you ran into the
house, you ran to the window,

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:47.506
you ran inside, you ran to Mayella,
and you ran to Sheriff Tate.

01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:52.177
Did you, during all this
running, run for a doctor?

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:54.680
There wasn't no need to.
I seen who done it.

01:13:57.684 --> 01:14:01.353
Now, Mr. Ewell, you've heard
the sheriff's testimony.

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:04.273
Do you agree with his description
of Mayella's injuries?

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:07.359
I agree with everything
Mr. Tate said.

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:12.781
Her eye was blacked.
She was mighty beat up.

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:18.871
Mr. Ewell, can you...

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:21.707
Can you read and write?

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.712
Yes, Mr. Finch.
I can read and I can write.

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:30.549
Good.

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:34.887
Then will you write
your name, please?

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.640
Right there. Show us.

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:10.714
Now what's
so interesting?

01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:13.425
You're left-handed,
Mr. Ewell.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:17.596
What's that got to do with it, Judge?
I'm a God-fearing man.

01:15:17.764 --> 01:15:20.432
That Atticus Finch, he's trying
to take advantage of me.

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:23.018
You've got to watch tricky
lawyers like Atticus Finch.

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:25.187
Quiet, sir.

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:27.940
The witness may
take his seat.

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:40.953
Mayella Violet Ewell.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.134
Put your hand on
the Bible, please.

01:15:57.637 --> 01:15:59.596
Solemnly swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:01.807
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:03.475
Sit down, please.

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.314
Now, Mayella,

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:15.154
suppose you tell us
just what happened, huh?

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.824
Well, sir...

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:21.660
Sir,

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:27.583
I was sitting on the porch
and he come along.

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:33.505
There was this old
chifforobe in the yard

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:37.301
and I said,

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:42.306
"You come in here, boy, and bust up this
chifforobe and I'll give you a nickel."

01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:46.477
So, he come on in the yard

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.354
and I go in the house
to get him the nickel.

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:54.359
And I turn around, and
before I know it he's on me.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:17:00.449
I fought and hollered,
but he had me around the neck

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.869
and he hit me
again and again.

01:17:06.706 --> 01:17:09.374
And the next thing I knew,

01:17:09.793 --> 01:17:12.878
Papa was in the room,
standing over me, hollering,

01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:16.799
"Who done it?"

01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:19.718
Thank you, Mayella.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.222
Your witness, Atticus.

01:17:27.477 --> 01:17:29.019
Miss Mayella,

01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:32.731
is your father good to you?

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:37.236
I mean, is he easy
to get along with?

01:17:39.239 --> 01:17:40.697
Does tolerable.

01:17:40.782 --> 01:17:42.366
Except when
he's drinking?

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:48.747
When he's riled,
has he ever beaten you?

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:58.924
My pa's never touched a
hair on my head in my life.

01:18:04.097 --> 01:18:07.599
You say that you asked Tom
to come in and chop up a...

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:09.560
What was it?

01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:12.437
A chifforobe.

01:18:13.106 --> 01:18:18.110
Was that the first time that you ever
asked him to come inside the fence?

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:19.611
Yes.

01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:25.534
Didn't you ever ask him to
come inside the fence before?

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:31.748
I might have.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.878
But can you remember
any other occasion?

01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:37.129
No.

01:18:38.798 --> 01:18:40.048
You say,

01:18:40.967 --> 01:18:43.886
"He caught me,
he choked me,

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:46.179
"and took advantage of me,"
is that right?

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:53.145
Do you remember him
beating you about the face?

01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:58.317
No, I don't

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:02.237
recollect if he hit me.

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:11.830
I mean, yes, he hit me!

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:19.421
Thank you.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:22.549
Will you identify
the man who beat you?

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.552
Most certainly will.
Sitting right yonder.

01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:29.848
Tom, will you
stand up, please?

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:33.894
Let Miss Mayella have a
good, long look at you.

01:19:43.029 --> 01:19:46.031
Tom, will you catch this,
please?

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:52.579
Thank you.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.793
Now, then, this time,

01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.878
will you please catch
it with your left hand?

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:01.964
I can't, sir.

01:20:02.048 --> 01:20:03.548
Why can't you?

01:20:03.925 --> 01:20:06.259
I can't use my
left hand at all.

01:20:07.387 --> 01:20:10.555
I got it caught in a cotton
gin when I was 12 years old.

01:20:11.391 --> 01:20:13.392
All my muscles
were tore loose.

01:20:31.119 --> 01:20:33.787
Is this the man
who raped you?

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:36.915
Most certainly is.

01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:39.835
How?

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:44.965
I don't know how.

01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:48.719
He just done it.

01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:53.724
You have testified
that he choked you

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.435
and he beat you.

01:20:57.562 --> 01:21:01.898
You didn't say that he sneaked up
behind you and knocked you out cold,

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:05.110
but that you turned around

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.779
and there he was.

01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:12.617
Do you want to tell us
what really happened?

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.622
I've got something to say!

01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:22.294
And then I ain't
gonna say no more!

01:21:26.591 --> 01:21:28.592
He took advantage of me.

01:21:32.472 --> 01:21:36.933
And if you fine,
fancy gentlemen

01:21:37.018 --> 01:21:39.478
ain't going to do
nothing about it,

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:44.483
then you're just a bunch of lousy,
yellow, stinking cowards!

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.152
The whole bunch of you!

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:50.238
And your fancy airs
don't come to nothing!

01:21:50.323 --> 01:21:53.533
Your "ma'am-ing"
and your "Miss Mayella-ing,"

01:21:53.618 --> 01:21:56.453
it don't come to nothing,
Mr. Finch!

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:02.918
Sit down, there.

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:04.044
Poor girl.

01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:22.687
Atticus?

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:27.943
Mr. Gilmer?

01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:33.949
The State rests, Judge.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.584
Tom Robinson, take the stand.

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:02.018
Put your hand on the Bible.

01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:04.980
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

01:23:05.064 --> 01:23:06.731
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:23:06.816 --> 01:23:08.191
- I do.
- Sit down.

01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:22.205
Now, Tom...

01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:26.459
Were you acquainted
with Mayella Violet Ewell?

01:23:26.961 --> 01:23:28.044
Yes, sir.

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:31.506
I had to pass her place going to
and from the field every day.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.676
Is there any other way
to go?

01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:37.888
No, sir,
none as I know of.

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:40.974
And did she ever
speak to you?

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:42.601
Yes, sir.

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:45.896
I'd tip my hat
when I'd go by.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.193
One day she asked me
to come inside the fence,

01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:53.111
bust up a chifforobe
for her.

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:56.615
She gave me the hatchet
and I broke it up.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:01.411
And then she said, "I reckon I'll
have to give you a nickel, won't I?"

01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:04.080
And I said, "No, ma'am,
there ain't no charge."

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:06.750
Then I went home.

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:13.465
Mr. Finch, that was way last
spring, way over a year ago.

01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:16.593
And did you ever go
on the place again?

01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:21.097
Yes, sir.

01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:23.308
When?

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.231
I went lots of times.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:32.859
Seemed like every time
I passed by yonder,

01:24:32.944 --> 01:24:35.445
she'd have some little
something for me to do.

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:38.281
Chopping kindling and
toting water for her.

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:47.916
Tom,

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:55.215
what happened to you on the evening
of August 21 of last year?

01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:04.849
Mr. Finch,

01:25:05.977 --> 01:25:08.728
I was going home as
usual that evening.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:13.275
When I passed
the Ewell place,

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:17.320
Miss Mayella was on the porch,
like she said she was.

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:21.574
She said for me to come there
and help her a minute.

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:25.120
I went inside the fence

01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:28.581
and I looked around for
some kindling to work on,

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.709
but I didn't see nothing.

01:25:32.545 --> 01:25:35.297
And then she said
to come in the house,

01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:37.674
she has a door
that needs fixing.

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:42.470
So I follows her inside
and looked at the door

01:25:43.264 --> 01:25:44.556
and it looked all right.

01:25:46.517 --> 01:25:48.184
Then she shut the door.

01:25:50.146 --> 01:25:54.107
All the time I was wondering
why it was so quiet like.

01:25:56.444 --> 01:26:00.905
Then it come to me, there was
not a child on the place.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:07.037
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
where are the children?"

01:26:08.706 --> 01:26:11.291
And she said they all
gone to get ice cream.

01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:15.128
She said it took her a slap
year to save seven nickels,

01:26:15.588 --> 01:26:18.465
but she done it,
and they all gone to town.

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:22.719
What did you say then?

01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:27.265
I said something like,

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:32.354
"Why, Miss Mayella, it's right
nice of you to treat them."

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:35.148
And she said,
"You think so?"

01:26:36.192 --> 01:26:40.904
Well, I said I best be going,
I couldn't do nothing for her.

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:43.239
And she said,
oh, yes, I could.

01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:45.492
And I asked her, "What?"

01:26:47.328 --> 01:26:51.081
And she said to just step
on the chair yonder

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:54.626
and get that box down
from on top of the chifforobe.

01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:59.881
So I done like she told me

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:02.217
and I was reaching

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:05.470
and the next thing I know,

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:09.182
she grabbed me
around the legs.

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:19.609
She scared me so bad, I hopped
down and turned the chair over.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.444
That was the only thing,

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.781
the only furniture
disturbed in the room,

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:26.991
Mr. Finch, I swear,
when I left it.

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:33.540
And what happened after you
turned the chair over?

01:27:40.214 --> 01:27:41.339
Tom?

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:50.265
You've sworn to tell
the whole truth.

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:52.934
Will you do it?

01:27:56.147 --> 01:27:57.981
What happened after that?

01:28:03.112 --> 01:28:04.446
Mr. Finch,

01:28:06.532 --> 01:28:10.535
I got down off the chair
and I turned around

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:14.789
and she sort of jumped on me.

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:18.626
She hugged me
around the waist.

01:28:19.712 --> 01:28:22.130
She reached up and
kissed me on the face.

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:27.886
She said she had never kissed
a grown man before

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.847
and she might as well kiss me.

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:34.684
She said for me
to kiss her back.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:40.440
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
let me out of here."

01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:42.150
And I tried to run.

01:28:44.487 --> 01:28:48.281
Then Mr. Ewell cussed
at her from the window

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:51.910
and said he's going
to kill her.

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:02.795
What happened after that?

01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:10.678
I was running so fast,
I don't know what happened.

01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:22.774
Tom, did you rape
Mayella Ewell?

01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:28.613
I did not, sir.

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:32.492
Did you harm her
in any way?

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:41.709
I did not, sir.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:03.147
Robinson,

01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:07.735
you're pretty good at
busting up chifforobes

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:09.737
and kindling with
one hand, aren't you?

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:12.240
Strong enough to choke the
breath out of a woman

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:14.200
and sling her to the floor?

01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:16.411
I've never
done that, sir.

01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:18.496
But you're strong
enough to?

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:21.541
I reckon so, sir.

01:30:22.042 --> 01:30:23.042
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:32.427
How come you were so all-fired
anxious to do that woman's chores?

01:30:36.599 --> 01:30:40.018
Looks like she didn't have
nobody to help her.

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:42.270
Like I said...

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:45.106
With Mr. Ewell and seven
children on the place?

01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:49.360
You did all this chopping and
work out of sheer goodness, boy?

01:30:51.238 --> 01:30:53.573
You're a mighty
good fellow, it seems.

01:30:53.866 --> 01:30:56.200
Did all that
for not one penny.

01:30:57.411 --> 01:30:58.453
Yes, sir.

01:30:59.705 --> 01:31:02.707
I felt right sorry for her.
She seemed...

01:31:19.892 --> 01:31:21.726
You felt sorry for her?

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:24.479
A white woman?

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:29.734
You felt sorry for her.

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.435
To begin with,

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:08.606
this case should never
have come to trial.

01:32:08.691 --> 01:32:13.194
The State has not produced
one iota of medical evidence

01:32:13.696 --> 01:32:16.489
that the crime
Tom Robinson is charged with

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:19.701
ever took place.

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:25.957
It has relied instead upon the
testimony of two witnesses

01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:30.169
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:31.963
on cross-examination,

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:36.467
but has been flatly
contradicted by the defendant.

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:41.848
There is circumstantial
evidence to indicate

01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:46.394
that Mayella Ewell
was beaten savagely

01:32:47.521 --> 01:32:52.024
by someone who led, almost
exclusively, with his left.

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:58.906
And Tom Robinson now sits before
you, having taken the oath

01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:01.659
with the only good
hand he possesses,

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:04.078
his right.

01:33:15.841 --> 01:33:19.177
I have nothing
but pity in my heart

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:23.848
for the chief witness
for the State.

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.856
She is the victim of cruel
poverty and ignorance.

01:33:38.447 --> 01:33:42.283
But my pity does
not extend so far

01:33:42.785 --> 01:33:45.953
as to her putting
a man's life at stake,

01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:51.292
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

01:33:52.795 --> 01:33:56.130
I say "guilt," gentlemen,

01:33:56.256 --> 01:34:01.219
because it was guilt
that motivated her.

01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:05.056
She's committed no crime.

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:12.104
She has merely broken a rigid and
time-honored code of our society.

01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:17.777
A code so severe, that whoever
breaks it is hounded from our midst

01:34:18.195 --> 01:34:19.737
as unfit to live with.

01:34:20.405 --> 01:34:24.909
She must destroy the evidence
of her offense.

01:34:26.787 --> 01:34:30.915
But, what was the evidence
of her offense?

01:34:31.041 --> 01:34:35.086
Tom Robinson,
a human being.

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:41.467
She must put Tom Robinson
away from her.

01:34:44.096 --> 01:34:47.473
Tom Robinson was to
her a daily reminder

01:34:47.933 --> 01:34:49.642
of what she did.

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:52.728
What did she do?

01:34:54.398 --> 01:34:58.776
She tempted a Negro.
She was white, and she tempted a Negro.

01:35:00.821 --> 01:35:04.240
She did something that in
our society is unspeakable.

01:35:05.951 --> 01:35:07.493
She kissed a black man.

01:35:08.996 --> 01:35:10.454
Not an old uncle,

01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:15.293
but a strong,
young Negro man.

01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:21.799
No code mattered to her
before she broke it.

01:35:22.676 --> 01:35:25.803
But it came crashing down
on her afterwards.

01:35:33.854 --> 01:35:35.605
The witnesses for the State,

01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:38.190
with the exception of the
sheriff of Maycomb County,

01:35:38.317 --> 01:35:41.319
have presented themselves to
you gentlemen, to this court,

01:35:43.322 --> 01:35:46.866
in the cynical confidence

01:35:47.534 --> 01:35:49.994
that their testimony
would not be doubted,

01:35:51.622 --> 01:35:56.375
confident that you gentlemen
would go along with them

01:35:56.501 --> 01:35:58.127
on the assumption,

01:36:00.881 --> 01:36:04.800
the evil assumption
that all Negroes lie,

01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:08.304
all Negroes are
basically immoral beings,

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.725
all Negro men are not to be
trusted around our women.

01:36:16.188 --> 01:36:20.566
An assumption that one associates
with minds of their caliber

01:36:21.568 --> 01:36:26.072
and which is, in itself,
gentlemen, a lie

01:36:28.742 --> 01:36:32.078
which I do not need
to point out to you.

01:36:38.377 --> 01:36:39.752
And so,

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:44.048
a quiet, humble,
respectable Negro

01:36:44.758 --> 01:36:48.511
who has had
the unmitigated temerity

01:36:48.887 --> 01:36:51.263
to feel sorry
for a white woman

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:57.395
has had to put his word
against two white people's.

01:37:03.777 --> 01:37:06.404
The defendant
is not guilty,

01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:10.574
but somebody in
this courtroom is.

01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:13.953
Now, gentlemen,

01:37:15.789 --> 01:37:17.373
in this country,

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:21.585
our courts are
the great levelers.

01:37:21.962 --> 01:37:23.462
In our courts,

01:37:24.464 --> 01:37:29.427
all men are created equal.

01:37:31.722 --> 01:37:33.264
I'm no idealist

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:36.142
to believe firmly
in the integrity

01:37:36.226 --> 01:37:38.477
of our courts and
in our jury system.

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:43.107
That's no ideal to me.
That is a living, working reality.

01:37:47.738 --> 01:37:52.283
I am confident that
you gentlemen will review

01:37:53.285 --> 01:37:56.412
without passion

01:37:56.496 --> 01:37:59.290
the evidence
that you have heard,

01:38:00.959 --> 01:38:02.334
come to a decision

01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:06.505
and restore this man
to his family.

01:38:17.267 --> 01:38:19.060
In the name of God,

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:23.230
do your duty.

01:38:30.614 --> 01:38:34.075
In the name of God,

01:38:36.161 --> 01:38:37.620
believe Tom Robinson.

01:39:13.657 --> 01:39:16.283
How long has the jury
been out now, Reverend?

01:39:17.035 --> 01:39:18.619
Let's see.

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:21.539
Almost two hours now.

01:39:24.042 --> 01:39:27.711
I think that's an awful
good sign, don't you?

01:40:14.092 --> 01:40:16.260
Court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:40.451
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:42.453
We have, Your Honor.

01:40:47.292 --> 01:40:50.461
Will the defendant please
rise and face the jury?

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:00.304
What is your verdict?

01:41:01.473 --> 01:41:04.099
We find the defendant
guilty as charged.

01:41:23.995 --> 01:41:26.830
Gentlemen,
this jury is dismissed.

01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:33.504
Court's adjourned.

01:41:45.475 --> 01:41:48.018
I'll go to see Helen, first
thing tomorrow morning.

01:41:48.144 --> 01:41:51.272
I told her not to be disappointed,
we'd probably lose this one.

01:41:53.108 --> 01:41:54.358
Tom.

01:42:10.125 --> 01:42:11.333
Yes, Mr. Finch.

01:42:56.588 --> 01:42:58.255
Miss Jean Louise?

01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:02.217
Stand up.

01:43:06.598 --> 01:43:08.932
Your father's passing.

01:43:37.003 --> 01:43:38.504
Atticus.

01:43:44.636 --> 01:43:46.470
I'm sorry, Atticus.

01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:48.138
Thank you, Maudie.

01:43:57.941 --> 01:43:59.817
Atticus, can I see
you for a minute?

01:44:03.154 --> 01:44:04.321
Will you excuse me?

01:44:29.973 --> 01:44:31.098
Jem?

01:44:32.517 --> 01:44:33.642
Yes, ma'am.

01:44:38.273 --> 01:44:39.982
I don't know
if it'll help,

01:44:41.359 --> 01:44:43.026
but I want to
say this to you.

01:44:48.032 --> 01:44:49.867
There are some men
in this world

01:44:51.953 --> 01:44:55.372
who were born to do
our unpleasant jobs for us.

01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:01.336
Your father's one of them.

01:45:06.468 --> 01:45:07.551
Oh, well.

01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:35.579
What's the matter,
Atticus?

01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:41.251
Tom Robinson is dead.

01:45:51.763 --> 01:45:56.767
They were taking him to
Abbotsville for safekeeping.

01:45:58.269 --> 01:45:59.937
Tom broke loose and ran.

01:46:02.106 --> 01:46:03.774
The deputy

01:46:04.943 --> 01:46:07.277
called out to him to stop.

01:46:07.946 --> 01:46:09.363
Tom didn't stop.

01:46:11.616 --> 01:46:15.869
He shot at him to wound him
and missed his aim.

01:46:19.624 --> 01:46:20.791
Killed him.

01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:27.464
The deputy says,

01:46:31.803 --> 01:46:34.263
"Tom just ran
like a crazy man."

01:46:44.566 --> 01:46:48.819
The last thing I told him was not to
lose heart, that we'd ask for an appeal.

01:46:58.496 --> 01:47:00.622
We had such a good chance.

01:47:05.336 --> 01:47:08.171
We had more
than a good chance.

01:47:23.354 --> 01:47:25.355
I have to go out
and tell his family.

01:47:26.983 --> 01:47:29.192
Would you look after
the children, Maudie?

01:47:35.116 --> 01:47:37.868
Atticus, you want me
to go with you?

01:47:38.036 --> 01:47:40.829
No, Son. I think I'd
better go up there alone.

01:47:41.664 --> 01:47:42.998
Atticus.

01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:46.043
I'm going with you.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.172
All right, Son.

01:48:13.905 --> 01:48:17.407
Hello, Mr. Finch.
I'm Spence, Tom's father.

01:48:18.576 --> 01:48:20.035
Hello, Spence.

01:48:23.039 --> 01:48:24.081
Is Helen here?

01:48:24.165 --> 01:48:27.709
Yes, sir. She's inside, lying down,
trying to get a little sleep.

01:48:27.919 --> 01:48:30.504
We've been talking about
the appeal, Mr. Finch.

01:48:30.588 --> 01:48:32.255
How long you think
it will take?

01:48:35.051 --> 01:48:36.301
Spence...

01:48:37.887 --> 01:48:40.222
There isn't going
to be any appeal.

01:48:41.724 --> 01:48:44.643
Not now. Tom is dead.

01:48:45.103 --> 01:48:46.144
Dead?

01:48:53.444 --> 01:48:54.736
Helen.

01:49:25.852 --> 01:49:26.893
Boy,

01:49:29.063 --> 01:49:32.482
go inside and tell Atticus
Finch I said, "Come out here."

01:49:34.235 --> 01:49:35.527
Go on, boy.

01:51:13.835 --> 01:51:16.670
By October,
things had settled down again.

01:51:18.464 --> 01:51:22.801
I still looked for Boo every
time I went by the Radley place.

01:51:26.556 --> 01:51:30.225
This night, my mind was
filled with Halloween.

01:51:30.977 --> 01:51:34.771
There was to be a pageant representing
our county's agricultural products.

01:51:36.023 --> 01:51:38.024
I was to be a ham.

01:51:39.861 --> 01:51:43.113
Jem said that he would escort
me to the school auditorium.

01:51:44.824 --> 01:51:48.827
Thus began our
longest journey together.

01:52:07.638 --> 01:52:08.638
Scout?

01:52:08.723 --> 01:52:10.140
Yeah?

01:52:10.683 --> 01:52:14.269
Will you come on?
Everybody's gone!

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.730
I can't go home
like this!

01:52:17.023 --> 01:52:21.151
I'm going. It's almost 10:00 and
Atticus will be waiting for us.

01:52:21.861 --> 01:52:23.862
All right, I'm coming.

01:52:25.656 --> 01:52:28.450
But I feel like a fool,
walking home like this.

01:52:28.534 --> 01:52:30.869
It's not my fault
you lost your dress.

01:52:31.037 --> 01:52:33.747
I didn't lose it.
I just can't find it.

01:52:33.915 --> 01:52:35.624
Where are your shoes?

01:52:35.708 --> 01:52:37.417
I can't find them, either.

01:52:37.835 --> 01:52:39.210
You can get them tomorrow.

01:52:39.295 --> 01:52:40.587
But tomorrow is Sunday.

01:52:40.671 --> 01:52:43.548
You can get the janitor
to let you in. Come on.

01:53:11.452 --> 01:53:14.663
Here, Scout, let me hold on to
you before you break your neck.

01:53:19.335 --> 01:53:20.877
You don't have to hold me.

01:53:20.962 --> 01:53:22.045
Shh.

01:53:23.965 --> 01:53:25.298
What's the matter?

01:53:25.383 --> 01:53:26.716
Hush a minute, Scout.

01:53:35.351 --> 01:53:37.102
I thought I heard something.

01:53:40.398 --> 01:53:41.481
Ah!

01:53:41.565 --> 01:53:42.607
Come on.

01:53:53.452 --> 01:53:54.619
Wait.

01:53:56.414 --> 01:53:58.164
- Are you trying to scare me?
- Shh.

01:53:58.249 --> 01:53:59.332
You know I'm too old.

01:53:59.417 --> 01:54:00.500
Be quiet.

01:54:03.963 --> 01:54:05.755
I heard an old dog then.

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:08.508
It's not that.
I hear it when we're walking along.

01:54:09.343 --> 01:54:11.344
When we stop,
I don't hear it anymore.

01:54:12.722 --> 01:54:15.140
Oh, yeah,
my costume rustling.

01:54:16.267 --> 01:54:17.767
Halloween got you.

01:54:25.192 --> 01:54:27.027
I hear it now.

01:54:27.778 --> 01:54:31.239
I'll bet it's just old Cecil
Jacobs trying to scare us.

01:54:32.033 --> 01:54:34.993
Cecil Jacobs
is a big wet hen!

01:54:42.376 --> 01:54:43.460
Come on.

01:55:24.210 --> 01:55:27.879
Run, Scout! Run, Scout!
Run, run!

01:57:16.488 --> 01:57:18.281
Scout! Scout!

01:57:21.785 --> 01:57:23.369
What happened?

01:57:23.454 --> 01:57:25.955
I swear I don't know.
I just don't know.

01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:30.001
Cal, you go and tell
Dr. Reynolds to come over.

01:57:30.127 --> 01:57:31.127
Yes, sir.

01:57:32.796 --> 01:57:33.922
You all right?

01:57:34.006 --> 01:57:35.089
Yes, sir.

01:57:35.174 --> 01:57:36.174
Are you sure?

01:57:36.258 --> 01:57:37.300
Yes, sir.

01:57:45.976 --> 01:57:47.727
Sheriff Tate, please.

01:57:48.312 --> 01:57:50.605
Atticus, is Jem dead?

01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:52.982
No, he's unconscious.

01:57:53.525 --> 01:57:56.569
We won't know how badly he's
hurt until the doctor gets here.

01:57:56.862 --> 01:58:01.491
Heck, Atticus Finch.
Someone's been after my children.

01:58:04.745 --> 01:58:06.996
He's got a bad
break, so far as I can tell.

01:58:07.498 --> 01:58:09.582
Like somebody tried
to wring his arm off.

01:58:17.424 --> 01:58:19.008
I'll be right back,
Atticus.

01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:22.053
How's the boy, Doc?

01:58:22.137 --> 01:58:23.346
He'll be all right.

01:58:26.684 --> 01:58:28.184
Sheriff Tate.

01:58:48.289 --> 01:58:49.372
What is it, Heck?

01:58:54.295 --> 01:58:57.463
Bob Ewell's lying on the ground,
under that tree down yonder

01:58:57.548 --> 01:58:59.799
with a kitchen knife
stuck up under his ribs.

01:59:03.595 --> 01:59:04.929
He's dead, Mr. Finch.

01:59:19.903 --> 01:59:21.738
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

01:59:26.118 --> 01:59:28.578
He's not gonna bother
these children anymore.

01:59:30.998 --> 01:59:33.666
Miss Scout, do you think you
could tell us what happened?

01:59:35.461 --> 01:59:36.919
I don't know.

01:59:37.588 --> 01:59:41.591
All of a sudden somebody grabbed
me, knocked me down on the ground.

01:59:42.426 --> 01:59:43.760
Jem found me then.

01:59:44.678 --> 01:59:48.973
Then Mr. Ewell, I reckon, grabbed
him again, and Jem hollered.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:53.811
Then somebody grabbed me.
Mr. Ewell, I guess.

01:59:54.646 --> 01:59:56.356
Somebody grabbed him.

01:59:57.524 --> 02:00:00.443
Then I heard someone
panting and coughing.

02:00:04.698 --> 02:00:07.033
And I saw someone
carrying Jem.

02:00:07.368 --> 02:00:08.534
Who was it?

02:00:13.457 --> 02:00:15.166
There he is, Mr. Tate.

02:00:15.959 --> 02:00:17.627
He'll tell you his name.

02:00:45.864 --> 02:00:47.198
Hey, Boo.

02:00:49.326 --> 02:00:53.371
Miss Jean Louise,
Mr. Arthur Radley.

02:00:56.041 --> 02:00:58.376
I believe
he already knows you.

02:01:08.178 --> 02:01:10.263
Heck, let's go out
on the front porch.

02:01:22.693 --> 02:01:25.695
Would you like to say good
night to Jem, Mr. Arthur?

02:01:49.303 --> 02:01:52.638
You can pet him, Mr. Arthur.
He's asleep.

02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:56.893
You couldn't if he was awake, though.
He wouldn't let you.

02:02:00.564 --> 02:02:01.647
Go ahead.

02:02:40.562 --> 02:02:42.647
Come sit in
the swing, Mr. Arthur.

02:02:50.447 --> 02:02:54.617
I guess that
the thing to do is...

02:02:58.830 --> 02:03:02.500
Good Lord,
I must be losing my memory.

02:03:05.254 --> 02:03:09.590
I can't remember
whether Jem is 12 or 13.

02:03:13.887 --> 02:03:18.683
Anyway, it'll have to come
before the County court.

02:03:22.437 --> 02:03:25.856
Of course, it is a clear-cut
case of self-defense.

02:03:26.358 --> 02:03:29.694
I'll run down
to the office...

02:03:29.778 --> 02:03:31.070
Mr. Finch,

02:03:32.614 --> 02:03:36.033
do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell?
Is that what you think?

02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:40.705
Your boy never
stabbed him.

02:03:58.849 --> 02:04:00.766
Bob Ewell fell
on his knife.

02:04:02.644 --> 02:04:03.853
He killed himself.

02:04:09.234 --> 02:04:11.402
There's a black man
dead for no reason

02:04:12.237 --> 02:04:14.405
and now the man responsible
for it is dead.

02:04:15.741 --> 02:04:19.118
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr. Finch.

02:04:19.202 --> 02:04:21.037
I never heard tell
it was against the law

02:04:21.121 --> 02:04:22.872
for any citizen
to do his utmost

02:04:22.956 --> 02:04:24.457
to prevent a crime
from being committed,

02:04:24.541 --> 02:04:26.334
which is exactly
what he did.

02:04:26.627 --> 02:04:28.794
But maybe you'll tell
me that it's my duty

02:04:28.879 --> 02:04:31.380
to tell the town all about
it, not to hush it up.

02:04:32.257 --> 02:04:33.966
You know what
will happen then.

02:04:34.718 --> 02:04:37.553
All the ladies in Maycomb,
including my wife,

02:04:38.055 --> 02:04:40.765
will be knocking on his door
bringing angel food cakes.

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.059
To my way of thinking,

02:04:43.852 --> 02:04:47.313
taking the one man who's done
you and this town a big service

02:04:47.564 --> 02:04:50.775
and dragging him, with his shy
ways, into the limelight,

02:04:52.444 --> 02:04:53.903
to me, that's a sin.

02:04:55.489 --> 02:04:59.659
It's a sin and I'm not about
to have it on my head.

02:05:01.912 --> 02:05:03.746
I may not be much,
Mr. Finch,

02:05:04.873 --> 02:05:07.083
but I'm still
Sheriff of Maycomb County

02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:10.795
and Bob Ewell
fell on his knife.

02:05:12.673 --> 02:05:14.048
Good night, sir.

02:05:53.755 --> 02:05:55.256
Mr. Tate was right.

02:06:00.595 --> 02:06:02.012
What do you mean?

02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:10.187
It would be sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it?

02:06:39.426 --> 02:06:41.010
Thank you, Arthur.

02:06:49.686 --> 02:06:51.145
Thank you
for my children.

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.497
Neighbors
bring food with death

02:07:10.123 --> 02:07:14.752
and flowers with sickness,
and little things in between.

02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:17.630
Boo was our neighbor.

02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:23.260
He gave us two soap dolls,
a broken watch and chain,

02:07:24.387 --> 02:07:26.055
a knife

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:28.599
and our lives.

02:07:34.439 --> 02:07:36.565
One time, Atticus said

02:07:36.983 --> 02:07:38.609
you never really knew a man

02:07:38.693 --> 02:07:41.529
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

02:07:47.244 --> 02:07:50.246
Just standing on the
Radley porch was enough.

02:07:57.879 --> 02:08:01.215
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended

02:08:01.424 --> 02:08:03.759
and another summer
had taken its place,

02:08:04.427 --> 02:08:08.389
and a fall,
and Boo Radley had come out.

02:08:12.936 --> 02:08:15.938
I was to think of
these days many times,

02:08:16.356 --> 02:08:20.901
of Jem and Dill and Boo Radley
and Tom Robinson

02:08:23.488 --> 02:08:25.364
and Atticus.

02:08:33.915 --> 02:08:36.125
He would be in
Jem's room all night.

02:08:37.878 --> 02:08:41.839
And he would be there when
Jem waked up in the morning.
