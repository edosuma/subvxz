WEBVTT

00:32.573 --> 00:34.325
How far back do you want me to go?

00:37.538 --> 00:38.788
College?

00:38.872 --> 00:41.165
I was totally outgoing.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.668
A real people person.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.507
In high school, I felt like that mouse

00:49.591 --> 00:53.261
that gets dropped into the snake cage
and just kinda sits there,

00:53.429 --> 00:55.388
frozen, trying to blend in.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.143
I guess I remember being happy
when I was a kid.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.187
Back when you just naturally expect
good things to happen.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.899
Before my mom died.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.780
Now I just expect the worst

01:12.948 --> 01:15.450
and try not to get my hopes up.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.703
Which is why I'm here.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.371
Does that answer the question?

01:23.375 --> 01:26.335
Usually people just say where they're from
and where they worked before.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.464
Great. I'm already overqualified.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.674
So, in your previous experience,

01:31.800 --> 01:35.303
can you give me an instance
in which you went above and beyond

01:35.429 --> 01:38.181
the call of duty for a customer?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.474
No.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.727
I get it.

01:43.687 --> 01:47.231
You think you're too good for this.
Why are you even here?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.984
No, I'm sorry...

01:51.737 --> 01:53.738
I really need the money.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.784
I live at home,
I work my ass off at this internship.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.328
- I just...
- Yeah, it's not gonna work out here.

02:00.412 --> 02:04.165
I can tell your type.
You're just not a quality hire.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.731
Wazzup?

02:36.782 --> 02:40.576
No, I don't want the prepubescent look.
I want a woman.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.871
We don't retouch at Seattle Magazine.
We're journalists.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.123
No, not there. An intern.

02:46.542 --> 02:47.542
Yeah.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.877
That's what I'm saying. We respect women.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.046
Don't put that there.
That goes in the utility closet...

02:52.172 --> 02:53.548
- I know...
- And then refresh all the bathrooms.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.757
I was just giving you this change.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.717
Yeah, this is my job now.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.053
It's like spelling things out for interns.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.861
Fuck! Okay.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.696
Writers, ideas.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.575
It's idea time again. It's that time.
What have you got?

03:22.327 --> 03:25.454
Does anybody have an idea? Or a story?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.876
Are you guys here?
Can you hear me? Anyone?

03:30.085 --> 03:32.503
- Top 10 dog parks in Seattle.
- No.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.589
Summer activities for winter people.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.924
Not interested. Jeff?

03:37.259 --> 03:39.802
All right. How about this time travel ad?

03:39.887 --> 03:40.928
What have you got?

03:42.180 --> 03:45.224
Yeah, somebody e-mailed it in
from the classifieds.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.102
He's looking for somebody to go
back in time with him.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.438
Do a little tongue-in-cheek investigation.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.566
Find this guy, see if he thinks
it's real or if it's a prank.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.650
Not bad.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.360
The guy says, "You'll get paid
when you get back."

03:56.445 --> 03:57.862
"Bring your own weapons.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.574
"Safety's not guaranteed."
And he's only done this once before.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.702
See if maybe he believes in this stuff.
I don't know. I think it could be funny.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.663
You wanna do it? All right. You got it.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.956
Can I get a couple interns?

04:09.291 --> 04:10.583
- Help me with the research?
- I'll do it.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.711
- Do some heavy lifting...
- Me, too, please. Me.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.505
All right. Give me the lesbian and
the Indian, and I got a story.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.634
We sent a letter to the address in the ad
and asked them to get back to us.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.093
And I called the local paper,

04:21.178 --> 04:24.555
but they're really uptight about giving out
information on people that take out ads, so...

04:24.640 --> 04:25.723
I fucked Bridget.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.894
Yeah. You know, sometimes
somebody pisses you off so much

04:29.978 --> 04:31.395
that you just wanna get in there with...

04:31.480 --> 04:34.106
Did she like criticize your technique
the whole time?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.901
Like boss you around? She did, right?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.028
Maybe a little.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.948
All right, we should go.
Let's go to Ocean View.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.742
We can just find whoever put up the ad
and stake him out.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.661
We? What do you mean "we"?

04:46.912 --> 04:49.497
I mean we, the three of us.
Now you don't wanna go?

04:49.665 --> 04:51.707
- That place sucks.
- That place does not suck.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.501
I had the best summer of my life
in Ocean View.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.252
I'm not going.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.046
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.424
It seemed like I was asking,
but I'm actually telling as your boss.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.176
You're coming.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.805
Dad, I'm going out of town for a few days.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.934
- Out out?
- No, it's just this work thing.

05:10.769 --> 05:15.356
Yeah, I think it'd be great if you
went out, did a little social stuff.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.983
Get out of your funk.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.610
I have no funk. I'm totally funkless.

05:19.695 --> 05:23.197
Going out and being with your friends.
I think it's a great idea.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.241
What's wrong with me?

05:26.368 --> 05:30.371
Well, you're sad.
I don't know how to describe it.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.875
It's like there's a cloud following you.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.879
- You're antisocial, and you're a virgin.
- What?

05:39.131 --> 05:40.965
I don't ever see you with any guys.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.800
I don't remember the last time
you brought a guy home.

05:43.093 --> 05:47.430
Yeah, well, how do you know I'm not
on Craigslist having casual encounters?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.432
Or when I was away at the dorms?
You weren't there.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.808
I talked to Amy.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.309
Why are you talking
to my college roommate?

05:52.394 --> 05:53.436
We're Facebook friends.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.397
Oh, my God! How do I eject?

06:07.451 --> 06:10.036
Why do you have flames on your laptop?

06:10.829 --> 06:14.248
It's a gaming laptop. It's really fast.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.381
What time would you go back to?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.093
- If you could?
- I don't know.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.932
- I'm fine here.
- I would definitely go back.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.435
Everything cool is gone.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.438
The Aztecs.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.816
People killing themselves for each other.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.027
You wouldn't wanna see the dragons
and the elves

06:43.111 --> 06:45.029
fight each other in the magical forest?

06:45.238 --> 06:48.908
- Come on!
- No. That wasn't a time.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.872
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.210
Get in, retards.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.511
So, here's what I'm thinking.
We're budgeted for two rooms,

07:08.595 --> 07:09.887
but if we share a room,

07:09.971 --> 07:11.806
we can use that extra money
for some other shit.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.516
- What, drugs?
- That's exactly right.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.644
Easy, Arnau, we're messing with you, pal.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.855
We're talking about using it
for buffets and shit.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.733
You never done coke or anything
when you're studying for an exam?

07:23.235 --> 07:25.361
Cocaine? Are you crazy?

07:25.445 --> 07:28.823
- What is it you study?
- Biological and life sciences.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.909
Makes sense. So what are you doing
interning at a magazine?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.411
Diversity looks good on an application
for grad school.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.623
We got to get you laid on this vacation.
That's what needs to happen.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.335
- Vacation?
- All right, work trip, whatever.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.879
It's freezing here.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.047
It's got bite, don't it?

08:27.132 --> 08:29.341
Reminds me of going back to school.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.928
Yes. It's all one long school year now.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.722
No start, no finish.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.808
Except for this guy.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.311
How many years till you graduate, Arnau?

08:40.437 --> 08:42.855
Total, including doctorate
or just undergraduate?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.565
Forget it.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.823
How're we doing the beds?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.117
We'll do me in one, interns on the other.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.702
- Okay.
- No.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.746
Cool. Me and Darius.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.082
Fine. I hope you moisturize, Arnau,
'cause I cuddle.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.753
Tomorrow morning first thing,
we hit the post office.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.422
Let's hope our boy checks
his P.O. Box every day.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.132
There she is.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.427
What?

09:15.722 --> 09:19.141
"Wanted, someone to travel
back in time with me,"

09:19.267 --> 09:21.268
"this is not a joke."

09:21.811 --> 09:26.357
"P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, Washington."

09:26.858 --> 09:31.111
"You'll get paid after we get back.
Must bring your own weapons."

09:31.696 --> 09:34.323
"Safety not guaranteed."

09:40.163 --> 09:41.330
Hey, here we go.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.375
No way. He's too old to be time traveling.

09:44.459 --> 09:49.046
Come on. That's the time traveling demo.
White beards, spectacles, pipes.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.301
- Close.
- Wait, what about this one?

09:54.511 --> 09:58.389
Yeah. She wants to stop whoever
gave her that haircut from being born.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.673
Yo! Yo! It's him. It's the guy.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.591
Him? Are you sure?

10:34.676 --> 10:37.594
Yeah, I'm sure. Box 91 . Get in.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.596
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Following him.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.640
What about Jeff? You should call him!

11:46.206 --> 11:47.664
That's pretty amazing stuff, man.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.542
I'll tell you about the cat in the
box theory, it'll blow your mind.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.170
It's like I'm the only one who
really gets it. You know?

11:53.254 --> 11:56.882
I started this dialog with some
big shot theoretical physicist online,

11:56.966 --> 12:00.427
and I'm like, "Do the rules of quantum
mechanics allow for alternate histories?"

12:00.512 --> 12:01.970
And he just blasted me.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.098
You know, people are just so convinced
it's a fixed thing,

12:04.182 --> 12:07.351
but they're just, like, looking
at this little sliver of time,

12:07.435 --> 12:08.435
that's all people can see.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.106
It's not a fixed thing, Shannon. You
know, it's on and on in both directions.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.690
It's like a "V," you know what I mean?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.275
I gotta do a bathroom check, brother.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.111
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

12:19.447 --> 12:23.283
I'd like to fill out a comment card
on one of your employees, Kenneth.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.701
What's his last name?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.371
Sorry, ma'am, he's a little...

12:27.455 --> 12:30.624
No, no, it's a positive comment.
It's like complimenting him.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.003
Good. Kenneth Calloway.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.172
Calloway.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.637
Thanks.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.600
Hit the thing that says
I have a new message.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.979
"Liz confirmed you on Facebook."

12:53.022 --> 12:55.399
Here. No photos, that's a drag.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.402
Okay, good. She still lives here.
She lives in this town.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.654
Who is Liz McHollis?

13:01.239 --> 13:02.739
She was a girl I had a fling with

13:02.824 --> 13:04.658
when my family used to come here
over the summers.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.620
She was this really smokin' hot blond.
She was my first blowjob.

13:08.705 --> 13:13.333
If there's one girl
that I still think about, honestly.

13:15.336 --> 13:19.173
Here she is. Look at you, you went all rogue.
What did you get?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.842
- Got his name, where he works.
- Great.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.469
What did you guys get?

13:25.138 --> 13:28.474
She accepted, but no photo,
so I'm not really sure.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.600
What?

13:29.684 --> 13:32.478
He came here to hook up
with an old high school girlfriend.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.938
Seriously? That's what you've been doing?

13:35.023 --> 13:37.357
Well, I've been doing other stuff too, but

13:37.442 --> 13:39.651
maybe this will change your attitude
a little bit.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.654
That's her when she was 18,
I used to see her naked.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.739
So?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.824
So I'm coming back
to try to see her naked again.

13:45.909 --> 13:49.119
I'd be weirded out if some guy tried
to track me down after 20 years.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.039
I'd be weirded out too
if some guy tried to track you down.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.790
- Why?
- Who would do that?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.793
Tomorrow morning, I'll go in.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.671
You know, go undercover,
pretend to answer his ad

13:59.756 --> 14:02.090
and get the scoop on this yo-yo.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.520
- 991 Mallory. This is definitely it.
- What a piece of shit.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.065
All right, I'm goin' in.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.317
- How do I look, Arnau? Good.
- Good.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.152
- Can I go in?
- No, you did good last night,

14:22.237 --> 14:24.780
but I'm gonna handle this.
I don't wanna overwhelm the guy.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.032
All right? Wish me luck.

14:36.751 --> 14:37.876
So...

14:38.670 --> 14:42.714
Do you go out a lot back home,
like clubs and stuff?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.258
Not really.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.511
You know those really tight leggings
that girls wear,

14:47.595 --> 14:49.846
do you ever wear those?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.139
No.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.184
I think you would look nice in them.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.286
Hello?

15:24.716 --> 15:25.966
Kenneth?

15:29.512 --> 15:32.222
Kenneth? Kenneth Calloway, right?

15:33.850 --> 15:34.975
Is that right?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.022
My name is Jeff.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.904
Look, I saw your ad in the classifieds.
I wanna know if you need a partner.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.035
- What's your mission?
- What do you mean what's my mission?

15:53.661 --> 15:54.911
What's your reason for going back?

15:55.997 --> 15:59.833
Well, who wouldn't want to go back?
It's an amazing opportunity.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.793
To go back in time, you know?

16:01.919 --> 16:05.672
See gladiators and watch dinosaurs
with my own eyes.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.925
Have sex with a pilgrim.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.762
Fun stuff, that's all I want.
I wanna go back. It's neat.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.096
Who wouldn't want to go back, Kenneth?

16:13.181 --> 16:14.890
You wanna go back.
Why do you wanna go back?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.939
Well, do you need a partner?

16:29.197 --> 16:32.115
- Can you look fear and danger in the eye?
- That's an odd question.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.535
Have you ever stared
fear and danger in the eye

16:35.703 --> 16:37.746
and said, "Yes"?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.376
- Sure.
- Get off my porch.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.920
Let's start over. Come
on, we could be pals.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.548
Let's go back in time.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.344
Man, that smile...

16:53.388 --> 16:55.138
What is that smile?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.267
- You don't know pain.
- I don't know pain?

16:59.352 --> 17:01.478
- You don't know regret.
- Yeah. All right.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.480
- You don't know...
- Okay.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.316
Well, it was really nice to meet you.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.578
That's what I thought.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.666
So, what'd he say?

17:23.835 --> 17:26.420
Well, he's the real deal.
That ad is no prank.

17:26.503 --> 17:30.215
He's not like retarded,
but there's something wrong with this guy.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.759
Definitely didn't like my
ass, I'll tell you that.

17:32.844 --> 17:36.304
- So, what, that's it?
- Oh, no, this just got good.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.307
What makes you think
he won't slam the door in my face, too?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.476
'Cause you gotta be sincere
and charm him, okay?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.104
He's used to assholes like me
coming and making fun of him.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.274
Also probably none of the other people
were beautiful girls.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.276
- Easy, Arnau.
- What?

17:49.527 --> 17:53.196
But he's right. Use that, too.
There's something off about this guy, okay?

17:53.281 --> 17:55.949
So you gotta go slow,
like you're trapping a skittish animal.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.911
You know, lure him, play coy.
Girls know how to do that shit.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.456
You're dangling my vagina
out there like bait?

18:02.707 --> 18:03.915
What if this guy's a murderer?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.126
What if he cuts me up into little pieces
and eats me?

18:06.461 --> 18:08.336
Then the story's even better.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.659
Do you sell guns here?

18:41.078 --> 18:43.663
- What kind of guns?
- I don't know.

18:44.332 --> 18:48.084
Something sexy and affordable
with killing power.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.006
You should try C&R Guns in Wilkins.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.175
The state of Washington does not allow

18:55.259 --> 18:58.929
the sale of firearms in the
business premises of a grocer.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.599
What about those thingies

19:02.683 --> 19:08.480
with the spiky ball
at the end of the chain things?

19:08.606 --> 19:11.399
You know, with the... Do you have those?

19:11.734 --> 19:14.110
What exactly is the intended use?

19:14.445 --> 19:17.197
Is there a pest problem, or hunting?

19:17.281 --> 19:21.117
Well, if your ad had been written properly,
I may have a better idea of what I need.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.288
- My ad?
- Yeah.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.874
- It's pretty sloppy.
- Excuse me?

19:27.959 --> 19:29.042
You heard me.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.503
I hope you worked harder
on your calibrations.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.799
My calibrations are
flippin' pinpoint, okay?

19:39.595 --> 19:41.721
There are people after me.
How do I know you don't work for them?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.431
Because I've never worked
for anybody in my life.

19:43.558 --> 19:44.599
You ever faced certain death?

19:44.684 --> 19:48.019
If it was so certain,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

19:57.446 --> 19:59.573
This is a bad place to talk.

20:00.491 --> 20:03.285
I get off in like 15. Rendezvous?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.245
See you in eight.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.682
- Get down!
- What's going on?

20:25.766 --> 20:27.601
- Just get down! Don't let him see you.
- Wait, is he coming?

20:27.685 --> 20:28.685
- Yeah.
- What the hell is he doing?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.146
I don't know. He's all freaked out.
He thinks people are following him.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.857
We're gonna rendezvous.
He's taking me to a secure location.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.275
Get down!

20:36.193 --> 20:39.195
If this guy's taking you to some sex
bunker, he's gonna be freaked out

20:39.280 --> 20:42.115
when me and Arnau pull out of this thing
like it's a clown car.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.627
- Hey, what's going on out there?
- Get down!

20:55.796 --> 20:57.422
Shit! He's coming!

20:57.548 --> 20:59.049
Don't let him see me,
it'll blow everything for you.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.636
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know! Do something!

21:04.680 --> 21:07.682
We're being followed!
Go! Get in your car! Go!

21:16.442 --> 21:18.234
What the hell is this?

21:20.947 --> 21:21.947
- Oh, shit!
- Git! Git! Go! Get out!

21:22.031 --> 21:24.324
- What the fuck?
- He's got a gun!

21:29.622 --> 21:31.498
- Just get out.
- Where are we?

21:31.582 --> 21:35.835
I don't know. Just get out.
I'll come get you when I'm done. Come on!

21:37.672 --> 21:40.590
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Fuck that.

21:40.675 --> 21:43.885
- Are you guys racist?
- It's complicated.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.890
- Hello?
- It's too hot here right now. Can't talk.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.852
Look, my gut tells me you're not with them,
but I have to be absolutely certain.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.021
I'm gonna do
a quick background check on you.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.607
If everything is good,
I'll be in touch, okay?

21:58.192 --> 21:59.526
Yeah, okay.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.696
All right, over and... Good night.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.026
Hi, is Liz around?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.954
And it's not necessarily...

22:53.247 --> 22:55.749
It's not a false relationship,
but she's so charismatic.

22:57.585 --> 23:00.920
She's such a beam of light.

23:02.006 --> 23:05.884
All the reporters are saying that.
Also, what I'm reading from...

23:07.553 --> 23:10.180
I don't know. She was big, and like...

23:11.557 --> 23:14.267
And like your age? Yeah. Gross.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.436
It was more like...

23:16.604 --> 23:20.315
I don't know, like the years
have not been kind to her, you know?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.650
They pretty much took a shit
all over her face.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.988
- So, did your dude call yet?
- No.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.949
Maybe we should do a background check
on this guy,

23:30.034 --> 23:32.118
you know, make sure he's not a psychopath.

23:32.203 --> 23:35.038
- He seems pretty harmless.
- Don't worry, Darius, he'll call.

23:35.456 --> 23:39.459
I'm sure your weird mojo clicked with
his weird mojo and you got it in the bag.

23:40.294 --> 23:41.795
- C'mon!
- Ready, hike!

23:53.182 --> 23:54.224
Hi.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.895
- Thanks.
- Listen, I'm sorry about the noise level here.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.647
But we need to maintain cover.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.649
I'm certain I'm being recorded,
I'm certain I'm being followed.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.986
So, who are we dealing with here?

24:07.279 --> 24:11.324
I'm not sure yet.
Government agents maybe. Probably.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.742
But the joke's on them.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.829
The technology I've invented
can't be understood by the average mind.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.291
So, what are the means of transportation?

24:21.168 --> 24:22.836
Just hold it in your holster
for a second, okay?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.921
I'm still making up my mind about you
as a potential partner.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.090
I have to be absolutely certain
that I can trust you

24:27.174 --> 24:30.135
before I include you in
certain information.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.179
Well, I just don't wanna be jerked around.

24:33.264 --> 24:35.098
You know, jerking around is for jerks.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.274
God, I remember this smell.
The smell of grass.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.901
I used to play a little
bit, back in the day.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.445
- I think you should give Liz another chance.
- Oh, you do?

24:49.530 --> 24:52.574
That sucks to spend all that time
thinking about her,

24:52.658 --> 24:55.076
and you're finally here
and you don't follow through with it.

24:55.286 --> 24:58.163
I think it's sad that you're a 22-year-old
virgin with those creepy glasses,

24:58.247 --> 24:59.455
but I don't bring it up.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.417
You know what? Actually, Arnau,
there are lots of hot chicks here, man.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.377
You could kill in a place like this.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.255
You should run game.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.383
Arnau, Arnau, Arnau, be cool, run game.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.678
- She's in high school.
- I know!

25:13.762 --> 25:16.222
I know she's in high school
and you're in college.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.474
Who do you think that girl wants to fuck?
You!

25:18.559 --> 25:19.851
- Could you, please!
- What?

25:19.935 --> 25:22.228
So what's the year? Where are we going?

25:22.688 --> 25:26.024
- 2001 . Is that gonna work for you?
- It's perfect.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.067
I will need to know the timetable, though.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.612
There's a critical step soon.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.740
I need to obtain certain materials
to facilitate the travel.

25:33.824 --> 25:36.201
I plan to execute this step
within the next week.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.412
Why 2001? What are you going back for?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.582
Like I said, certain information
will have to wait.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.626
Knock him on his ass, he's a bum!

25:44.793 --> 25:47.378
- Right there, these two.
- All right. Let's go.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.215
Why? Sit down. We're not going anywhere.
Tell me why. Why?

25:50.591 --> 25:52.258
You're drinking alcohol
at a high school game.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.970
You're damn right I am.
United States of America.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.348
Drinking a beer at a football game.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.018
Don't get tough on me, big guy.
Let's not do this.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.103
Wait a minute, I know him.
He came to my house.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.649
I think that guy
is recording our conversation.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.901
Is there somewhere else we can go?

26:09.985 --> 26:11.027
Let's get out of here. Come on.

26:16.617 --> 26:19.035
- Stay close. Yeah.
- Are you okay?

26:19.119 --> 26:22.288
I really would have messed that guy up if I
wasn't trying to keep such a low profile.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.540
I'm glad I got to see
your qualities, though.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.626
I think you're ready for the next step,
some basic training.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.213
The heat's moving in.
That's all for tonight.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.973
I'm leaving. I'm walking out!

26:40.474 --> 26:42.934
I'm leaving by choice. By choice.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.437
- Seriously?
- This place is a dump. Let's get out of here.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.106
Fuck.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.949
Pretty good. You might
be a one arm shooter.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.993
- Okay, I'll try it.
- Let's just loosen it up.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.786
- You ready?
- Yeah.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.626
- Yeah! You smoked him!
- I smoked him.

27:08.711 --> 27:09.961
Come on!

27:10.838 --> 27:12.505
I think I'm getting better than you.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.341
Hey, let's not get ahead of
yourself here, okay?

27:15.926 --> 27:18.261
It's one thing to hit a target
that's standing still,

27:19.054 --> 27:22.056
but think about it when
the heat's moving in.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.479
Smoke it!

27:42.995 --> 27:44.537
Double smoke!

28:09.229 --> 28:11.981
- How are your hamstrings holding up?
- Real good.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.067
You're pretty impressive with a handgun.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.029
It's a superlative performance
under simulated pressure.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.405
Our chemistry is starting to build.

28:21.492 --> 28:24.577
I really like your intensity.
You're, like, no-nonsense.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.288
There's no sense in nonsense.
Especially when the heat's hot.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.915
Exactly.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.212
I like your intensity, too.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.464
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You've got good moves.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.841
Nobody's seen my moves before.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.135
Haven't brought a candidate
this far into the training process.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.428
Really?

28:42.763 --> 28:44.597
We'll be learning from each other
from now on.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.517
Good.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.065
We still have to discuss your reason
for going back.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.110
That's classified information.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.529
I can appreciate that, I respect that,

28:59.613 --> 29:02.156
but I have a certain responsibility to keep
as the leader of this mission.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.284
Then I have to tell you that it's personal.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.540
Darius, sometimes I think we are
progressing in this mission,

29:10.624 --> 29:13.626
and then other times, I'm not so sure.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.429
I'm going back to stop my mother
from dying when I was 14.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.436
How'd she die?

29:33.147 --> 29:34.772
She was killed by some guy.

29:36.650 --> 29:39.235
Just some guy at a gas station
took her and killed her.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.655
- Oh, man. Just some random thing?
- Yeah.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.875
Well, no, actually.

29:55.836 --> 29:59.005
She was driving home. It was really late,

29:59.298 --> 30:03.009
and she called me to tell me
she was coming home, and I...

30:06.054 --> 30:10.057
I asked her to stop
and get me chocolate milk.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.061
Because I had to have chocolate milk.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.150
So like five minutes later, she called me

30:19.234 --> 30:23.404
to tell me that she got the chocolate milk
and she was coming home.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.240
And her voice was like,

30:27.367 --> 30:30.203
really excited, like she was really happy.

30:32.372 --> 30:37.126
And I was, like, okay, whatever.
I wasn't even nice.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.798
That was the last time I talked to her.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.426
That's not your fault.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.806
Yeah. That's what they tell me.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.562
All right, Darius.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.651
I think you're ready. I trust you.

31:03.737 --> 31:04.820
Good.

31:06.323 --> 31:07.698
You should.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.610
- Jeff! Hey!
- Hey. Liz, it's great to see you.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.529
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

31:46.613 --> 31:49.198
- So, this is where you live.
- This is my house.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.325
Well, look, I wanna say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.202
I was gonna come,
but work's getting crazy and...

31:53.287 --> 31:57.582
I was sad 'cause you got me
thinking about you on that Facebook.

31:58.375 --> 32:02.169
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- I never thought I'd see you again.

32:02.296 --> 32:06.549
Oh, God, excuse me. Would you come in?

32:07.050 --> 32:08.634
I'd love to.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.055
Your hair's red.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.181
Yeah.

32:14.308 --> 32:15.558
It's different.

32:15.809 --> 32:20.021
Yeah. I changed it. It's just about
the only thing I've changed.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.316
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.485
Kind of. What about you?

32:26.653 --> 32:28.654
A lot has changed. Almost,
like, everything.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.490
- Tell me.
- The car... I got an Escalade.

32:31.783 --> 32:36.245
And my job's going really well.
Got a great condo.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.957
Tell me about your life.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.667
I just did.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.046
- I've got to read this magazine of yours.
- Oh, don't.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.215
- That is so exciting.
- It's not that exciting.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.800
You know what?

32:50.177 --> 32:52.595
I always thought you'd do something
special with your life.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.723
If you knew what it was really like,
you wouldn't say it was special.

32:55.849 --> 32:57.683
Oh, come on. What...

32:57.809 --> 33:00.102
- What's wrong with your neck?
- Sorry I'm doing that.

33:00.187 --> 33:03.230
It's just I got this shooting pain.
I have to share a bed with a male intern.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.316
And I don't feel like
rubbing asses with him, so...

33:06.526 --> 33:09.278
- Let me see.
- You don't have to do that.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.159
- You need to put some heat on that.
- I do?

33:15.619 --> 33:18.496
- I have pies in the oven.
- You make pies?

33:18.580 --> 33:23.542
I made some pies.
I made peach, apple, strawberry rhubarb.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.003
Which one do you want?

33:26.505 --> 33:27.713
Yeah.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.053
Liz, that is unbelievable.

33:34.930 --> 33:39.350
You bake pies, you give these massages,

33:40.185 --> 33:42.061
and you're not married?

33:42.562 --> 33:44.105
I don't get it.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.483
I was married. He was a ball player.

33:48.151 --> 33:51.904
And I was the good little wife,
baking cookies for the team.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.823
Oh, my God, you bake cookies, too?

33:53.907 --> 33:55.116
Cameron got traded,

33:55.200 --> 33:58.536
and when he went up to the Marlins,
he started making money

33:59.955 --> 34:03.165
and started messing around
with those Miami girls.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.627
Well, I can say this honestly,
Cameron's an idiot.

34:07.838 --> 34:08.963
Yeah, well, we were young.

34:09.255 --> 34:13.007
Hey, do you have one free night
while you're in town?

34:13.092 --> 34:17.012
Because I would like to make you
a homemade dinner.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.309
I wanna eat that homemade dinner.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.353
I'm just gonna press "record." Okay.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.315
So, Kenneth,
why are you looking for a partner?

34:29.860 --> 34:31.360
I feel like

34:32.612 --> 34:35.447
the world is mostly full of jankholes,

34:35.824 --> 34:38.451
but I believe that there
are purists out there,

34:38.534 --> 34:40.077
and that's why I put that ad in the paper.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.706
It's my hope that
if you're watching this video,

34:45.333 --> 34:46.958
something incredible has happened.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.545
I do believe that martial arts
are for self-defense only.

34:49.629 --> 34:52.422
While I would like to maneuver through
this world with an open heart and mind,

34:52.507 --> 34:53.882
sometimes that doesn't gain you favor.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.092
So I just need to be equipped
with the necessary skill sets,

34:56.219 --> 34:58.554
guns, training, weapons, fighting,

34:58.638 --> 35:01.223
in case I encounter any obstacles
that need to be defeated.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.058
- The area is clear.
- Oh, my God!

35:03.143 --> 35:04.268
Mission accomplished.

35:04.352 --> 35:08.314
- Man, that was intense.
- Task completed.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.816
The mission has to do with regret

35:10.901 --> 35:14.153
and the mission has to do with mistakes.

35:14.237 --> 35:17.114
The mission's also about love.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.747
I'm already saying too much.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.167
Aren't you interested in some of
this equipment or something?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.669
Can we talk about something else?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.758
So it's very important that you and I
do not abuse the power

35:35.842 --> 35:37.176
that will come with our knowledge
of the future.

35:37.344 --> 35:40.805
No matter how tempting
it will be to gain personal fortune

35:40.972 --> 35:44.058
or notoriety by say,
being the first person to list

35:44.184 --> 35:46.685
the Contra code for up, up, down, down,
left-right, left-right, B-A-start.

35:46.812 --> 35:50.272
Or to say, "Hey, leave your Star Wars
figurines in the box"

35:50.357 --> 35:52.858
"'cause they'll be worth like hundreds more
if they are super pristine."

35:53.193 --> 35:56.862
But what about if it's, like,
for the betterment of future society?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.825
Absolutely not. We have
to stick to the plan.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.496
So when do you fill me in on the plan?

36:05.580 --> 36:08.374
Pretty soon. The action's getting hungry.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.044
I can't eat here.

36:12.546 --> 36:15.297
- Why?
- See that kid? He's like a mutant kid.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.217
Hey, there's something on your ear.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.136
- It's fine, it does...
- Are you okay?

36:21.221 --> 36:25.057
- It looks like it's falling off or something.
- No, no, no. It's fine. Don't worry about it.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.602
Shit! Sorry. It's off.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.482
- Kenneth!
- The mission's off, I'm sorry.

36:33.567 --> 36:36.110
Forget it. You're not the right one.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.925
Hey, what's wrong?

37:01.261 --> 37:02.636
It's fake.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.765
- What's fake?
- My flipping ear is fake.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.771
They used to make fun of me,
all the other kids.

37:17.694 --> 37:22.698
My parents could only afford one prosthetic,
so I had to wait until I was fully-grown.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.659
- You know that's not a big deal, right?
- Yes, it is!

37:25.744 --> 37:28.203
No, it isn't.
People used to make fun of me, too.

37:28.288 --> 37:29.705
Yeah, right.

37:31.207 --> 37:34.084
I shave my arms and wax my upper lip, okay?

37:34.961 --> 37:37.004
- You're saying that to make me feel better.
- I'm serious.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.298
I had a freaking mustache until I was 14.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.308
Okay, we can still do this,
but you have to promise me

37:49.476 --> 37:52.686
we're never, ever gonna talk about
my ear ever again

37:52.812 --> 37:54.688
for as long as you and I both shall live.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.649
- Okay. Okay.
- Forever.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.984
- But can I say something?
- What?

37:59.069 --> 38:01.236
I think it's kinda cool.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.574
- Get in.
- Okay.

38:21.633 --> 38:25.219
So then, what did you tell him your reason
for going back to 2001 is?

38:26.638 --> 38:28.180
I just made up some story.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.182
Yeah? What's the story?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.851
I told him that I was gonna go back

38:32.978 --> 38:34.687
and stop my parents from getting divorced.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.773
Arnau, you son of a bitch. Smash him!

38:37.941 --> 38:39.274
What are you doing?

38:39.359 --> 38:42.486
Whatever I'm doing,
I'm feeling fan-fucking-tastic doing it.

38:43.113 --> 38:45.531
Did you just have sex with that girl
you came here to stalk?

38:45.699 --> 38:48.742
No, I didn't, actually.
We shared a nice conversation.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.869
And you know the truth
is, she's not that fat.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.416
I don't know, a girl's beauty,
it's in the eyes, you know?

38:55.500 --> 38:57.793
And that doesn't go away with age.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.587
So, anyway,
can we please just focus on the article

39:00.714 --> 39:04.174
and figure out what's wrong with this guy,
like low I.Q.,

39:04.259 --> 39:06.385
or emotional disorder, or whatever it is?

39:06.469 --> 39:08.053
What makes you think there's something
wrong with him?

39:08.596 --> 39:10.222
'Cause he thinks he can go back in time.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.433
Was there something wrong with Einstein
or David Bowie?

39:12.559 --> 39:13.642
Not the same.

39:13.727 --> 39:15.811
Just because the guy's
trying to do something new

39:15.895 --> 39:16.979
doesn't mean he's a freak show.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.231
So you think this is normal?

39:19.315 --> 39:21.817
I don't know. Is it normal that your
interns do all your work for you?

39:21.901 --> 39:23.360
- Is that normal?
- Right.

39:23.445 --> 39:24.611
Is that how all your articles get written?

39:27.240 --> 39:28.866
It's him. I have to go.

39:46.551 --> 39:47.718
Okay, this is it.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.762
There's technology inside this building

39:49.888 --> 39:54.016
that I need to complete the machine
that will take us on our journey.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.311
I'm gonna breach the outer perimeter,
gonna disable their security measures,

39:57.437 --> 39:59.980
penetrate the target,
locate and secure the package,

40:00.106 --> 40:02.691
then we'll rendezvous at the getaway point.
You got it?

40:02.776 --> 40:04.276
Rendezvous at the getaway point.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.903
- I've been watching this place for weeks.
- Yeah, got it.

40:05.987 --> 40:09.281
- The security's full of holes. We'll be fine.
- Okay.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.411
- Fuck!
- Stay focused.

40:17.540 --> 40:25.130
What am I doing? Why am I doing this?

40:33.723 --> 40:35.599
Let me see those keys.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.211
Shit!

41:07.549 --> 41:08.549
Okay.

42:40.725 --> 42:41.892
Come on!

42:46.272 --> 42:47.314
Excuse me?

42:48.358 --> 42:50.484
Hey! Hey! What is that? What are those?

42:50.777 --> 42:52.236
- Lasers.
- Lasers?

42:52.612 --> 42:54.947
- Those are real lasers?
- The mission's been compromised.

42:55.031 --> 42:56.490
Hey. Where are you going?

42:56.616 --> 42:58.283
Let's get out of here! Drive!

43:01.246 --> 43:02.496
- Floor it!
- Sorry.

43:09.504 --> 43:10.921
What do we do with the van?

43:11.506 --> 43:13.423
Leave it. I stole it from the lot.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.927
Hey, you didn't hurt anyone, did you?
Like, you didn't...

43:17.011 --> 43:18.804
No, no, no, no. Look, it's a fake.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.514
- No casualties. Here. Take it.
- Okay.

43:20.598 --> 43:21.556
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:21.641 --> 43:22.975
Take this. It'll make you feel better.

43:25.895 --> 43:27.145
You're shaking.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.314
It's just adrenaline from the infiltration.
It's good.

43:29.691 --> 43:32.109
- You ready? Come on, let's go. Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

43:32.485 --> 43:33.485
Go. Go.

43:33.695 --> 43:35.821
We gotta stick to the back roads,
we can't be seen out here.

43:37.532 --> 43:39.950
Oh, my God! Okay.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.453
- Damn it! We're getting off the road.
- Why?

43:43.538 --> 43:45.998
Those are government employees.
They'll blow our cover.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.042
We gotta wait it out.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.673
Kenneth, it's fine. They won't tell.

43:54.757 --> 43:57.592
No. We can't have any witnesses
that will connect my car to the van.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.594
The people that are after me
are gonna be on full alert.

43:59.679 --> 44:00.971
They'll put the pieces together.

44:02.098 --> 44:03.473
Totally unprofessional!

44:05.184 --> 44:06.560
It's okay.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.399
It's just...

44:17.280 --> 44:18.613
It's a girl.

44:23.745 --> 44:25.412
My reason for going back is a girl.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.917
- Who was she?
- She's my first girlfriend.

44:32.003 --> 44:36.173
Her birthday was the exact same day
in April as mine is in October.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.510
We ended up working at the same restaurant.

44:40.595 --> 44:41.845
She was just so nice to me.

44:41.929 --> 44:46.099
She would make me special food

44:46.225 --> 44:51.188
and after work, while all her friends
were getting ready to go out,

44:52.065 --> 44:55.108
she would just hang out and talk with me.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.361
She was really pretty.

44:59.530 --> 45:00.739
What happened to her?

45:02.408 --> 45:03.909
She died.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.665
Some jerk,

45:13.503 --> 45:17.089
some a-hole jerk in a band got drunk

45:18.424 --> 45:22.135
and crashed his car into her living room.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.265
I should have been there, you know.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.147
People tell you that

45:35.441 --> 45:37.442
there are other girls out
there, you know, and

45:37.819 --> 45:39.611
it's not just about a girl, it's about...

45:41.239 --> 45:43.740
It's about a time and a place.

45:45.243 --> 45:46.827
Do you have a favorite song?

45:50.748 --> 45:53.667
Would you tell me what it is?

45:53.751 --> 45:56.294
- It's stupid.
- What is it?

45:59.006 --> 46:00.340
Over the Rainbow.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.427
It's a really beautiful song.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.765
It's that time and that
place and that song,

46:09.183 --> 46:12.102
and you remember what it was like
when you're in that place,

46:12.186 --> 46:13.562
and then you listen to that song,

46:13.646 --> 46:17.649
and you know you're not in that place
anymore and it makes you feel hollow.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.612
Can't just go find that stuff again.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.871
I like your reason for going back.

46:37.128 --> 46:38.420
It's really nice.

46:43.050 --> 46:44.134
Thanks.

46:51.434 --> 46:54.478
- Fucking lasers?
- What kind of lasers?

46:54.645 --> 46:56.480
I don't know, I'm not a
frickin' Stormtrooper.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.064
This guy's awesome.
He's over there right now

46:58.149 --> 46:59.941
thinking he's building
a frickin' time machine.

47:00.026 --> 47:02.152
Hey, Arnau, what are the chances
he can do that with these lasers?

47:02.236 --> 47:03.570
- How would I know, I'm not a...
- He doesn't know.

47:03.654 --> 47:04.654
He's not a frickin' Stormtrooper either.

47:04.739 --> 47:08.033
Stormtroopers don't know anything
about lasers or time travel,

47:08.117 --> 47:09.910
they're blue-collar workers.

47:09.994 --> 47:11.244
I gotta see this shit.

47:18.336 --> 47:21.630
- Isn't this like violating his privacy?
- Don't worry about it.

47:23.716 --> 47:26.468
I can't see much. Looks like an engine.

47:27.929 --> 47:29.638
What are you building in there, Kenny?

47:45.279 --> 47:46.446
Who's this asshole?

47:47.031 --> 47:48.532
Oh, my God, there are people following him.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.617
There are really people following him.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.246
We're doing this.

48:07.635 --> 48:09.511
Stay back. Don't spook him.

48:10.555 --> 48:14.099
- Stay back. Don't scare them.
- This is fucking intense.

48:14.183 --> 48:15.684
We're going fifteen miles an hour.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.403
Shit. He saw us.

48:27.321 --> 48:28.738
Oh, shit, they're onto us.

48:29.073 --> 48:30.073
Onto what?

48:41.586 --> 48:42.586
Shit.

48:44.422 --> 48:45.922
Don't let him see you! Duck!

48:48.843 --> 48:50.176
Stay down!

48:52.847 --> 48:54.306
What the hell, did you see those guys?

48:54.390 --> 48:56.516
They look like government agents
or something.

48:56.601 --> 48:59.769
- He's really being followed.
- Holy shit! Is this guy for real?

49:02.607 --> 49:04.691
- Kenneth? Are you okay?
- I can't talk right now, okay?

49:04.817 --> 49:06.568
- Just watch your back.
- Okay.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.528
- Stay low and lay low.
- Yeah.

49:08.613 --> 49:11.448
Go to the beach, I'll pick you up.
It's almost time, Darius.

49:16.203 --> 49:17.537
This is totally crazy.

49:17.872 --> 49:20.290
- Who do you think those guys are?
- I have no idea.

49:20.374 --> 49:24.002
Maybe he's not totally insane, maybe he
really thinks he's doing something and...

49:24.170 --> 49:25.503
I don't know.

49:26.464 --> 49:29.049
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

49:29.383 --> 49:31.718
I don't know. You got a thing for this guy?

49:32.136 --> 49:33.136
What?

49:35.723 --> 49:38.141
No! I'm talk...

49:39.060 --> 49:40.393
You saw those guys.

49:41.062 --> 49:43.104
Can I ask you a question?
Do you mind, as a reporter?

49:43.189 --> 49:44.731
What?

49:44.815 --> 49:47.192
What is it that you two weirdos
do when you're off alone?

49:47.818 --> 49:50.195
I'm getting information.
What are you doing when you're off alone?

49:50.321 --> 49:51.571
I'm seeing an old friend.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.325
Just take me to the beach.
I have to meet him.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.292
All right, this is it.

50:04.377 --> 50:07.170
It's pretty obvious they see a threat in me
possessing this kind of power.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.589
It's not clear yet what
entity they represent.

50:09.674 --> 50:12.384
Their presence here
definitely accelerates the plan, though.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.137
They're gonna
have one of their guys at every door,

50:16.222 --> 50:18.390
but you should be okay.
I don't think they've ID'ed you yet.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.017
- Got it.
- Good luck.

50:21.894 --> 50:23.061
Wait!

50:24.397 --> 50:25.730
Go! Go!

50:38.077 --> 50:39.244
Shannon?

50:42.248 --> 50:45.750
I'm supposed to give this to you.
This is from Kenneth.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.053
Kenneth said to give this to me?

51:01.100 --> 51:02.726
My wife, she's...

51:05.938 --> 51:07.397
You tell him...

51:10.401 --> 51:12.902
Tell him I hope he gets wherever he's goin'

51:13.946 --> 51:17.532
and it all works out like he wants.

51:18.617 --> 51:20.160
I'll tell him.

51:34.258 --> 51:35.633
All good?

51:36.761 --> 51:37.927
Yeah.

51:40.014 --> 51:41.014
What?

51:43.434 --> 51:44.517
Nothing.

52:05.790 --> 52:07.415
Yeah, we're getting
some really great stuff, Bridget,

52:07.500 --> 52:09.000
I'm gonna need a couple more days.

52:10.169 --> 52:12.128
Bridget, I'm doing an interview right now.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.964
Yeah, I'll send you an e-mail
with all the information,

52:15.049 --> 52:17.217
and I'll paint you a real picture.

52:17.301 --> 52:18.968
Okay. I have to go right now.

52:20.596 --> 52:23.932
That all seems so dangerous.
Her running around with this guy...

52:24.016 --> 52:27.060
She'll be fine. You got any more
of that leftover pie? That was pretty good.

52:27.686 --> 52:31.189
I was thinking about you
and the time we spent together.

52:31.649 --> 52:35.151
I was pretty ripped back then.
Top of my game back then.

52:35.236 --> 52:36.820
- You were not ripped.
- Yes, I was.

52:37.196 --> 52:38.488
Why don't you feel me now?

52:50.000 --> 52:51.209
You look great.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.932
- Are you familiar with cryptography?
- Yeah. Of course.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.809
Yeah. Well, I prefer
the St. Goodnight code and cipher

53:07.893 --> 53:10.144
for sending messages
that can't be compromised.

53:10.229 --> 53:13.815
It's just 4-4-3-1 -4 and then you
just reverse the whole thing, okay?

53:13.899 --> 53:15.233
Yeah. Got it.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.735
Learn it. Practice it.

53:19.738 --> 53:20.738
Hey!

53:20.990 --> 53:24.409
If I show you something, will you promise
not to tell anybody else about it, ever?

53:24.618 --> 53:25.618
Yeah.

53:28.914 --> 53:32.333
When we go back in time,
if anything bad happens,

53:33.711 --> 53:34.961
if somebody gets hurt,

53:35.045 --> 53:39.799
or if you mess up, or if the guys
who are after me find me and catch me,

53:39.884 --> 53:42.927
put a note inside this tin.
I'm gonna do the same thing.

53:43.095 --> 53:46.848
If anything goes wrong,
we go back and we fix it.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.224
Okay.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.274
So far so good.

53:57.610 --> 53:59.235
So that's been there since 2001?

53:59.945 --> 54:01.404
Since I was a kid.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.323
I used to come up here

54:03.407 --> 54:05.783
and camp with the Boy Scouts
near here when I was little.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.452
Do you know what Star Wars is?

54:08.746 --> 54:10.038
- Yes.
- Yeah.

54:10.122 --> 54:14.250
So, when I was younger, I used to
bring my Star Wars figures up here,

54:14.418 --> 54:17.211
'cause I didn't wanna leave 'em
back at the house 'cause they'd get lonely.

54:17.296 --> 54:21.299
And some of the more cynical kids
would make fun of me,

54:21.759 --> 54:23.551
- they would throw them in the fire and stuff...
- Really?

54:23.636 --> 54:25.929
This was before my martial arts training,
of course.

54:26.263 --> 54:27.972
But I found this hiding spot

54:28.140 --> 54:30.516
and sneak out here at night,

54:31.393 --> 54:36.022
and put 'em in the tin, take them out,
then put them back in the morning and...

54:36.106 --> 54:37.148
Anyway...

54:37.942 --> 54:39.651
I wish I could see you
when you were a little kid.

54:39.985 --> 54:42.320
I was not as impressive as I am now,
I can assure you.

54:42.655 --> 54:44.155
- What?
- Yeah.

54:46.492 --> 54:47.617
Okay.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.827
- Wanna see something cool?
- Yeah.

54:50.162 --> 54:51.454
Come on.

55:06.470 --> 55:09.931
That was the best sex I've ever had.
And I've had a lot of sex.

55:10.849 --> 55:13.017
That's what you said
about the roast chicken.

55:13.352 --> 55:15.353
That was the best roast chicken I ever had.

55:16.855 --> 55:19.315
You don't know
how long I've thought about this.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.069
You've become this, like, character

55:23.487 --> 55:27.281
in my head that's like,
it feels like you're from a fairy tale,

55:27.366 --> 55:30.535
and you're like this purity
that's just not in my life.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.706
You are so cute.

55:36.834 --> 55:40.503
Hey. This is gonna sound crazy.

55:42.047 --> 55:44.340
I want you to come to Seattle with me.

55:46.176 --> 55:47.969
- What?
- Yeah.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.639
It's crazy, but I want you to come...

55:51.724 --> 55:54.976
Jeff, the minute you drive out of this place,
you are not going to want to be with me.

55:55.060 --> 55:58.146
That's just not true. That's what I'm
saying, I mean, do you not feel this?

55:58.230 --> 56:00.982
- You're not in your right mind right now.
- I'm absolutely in my right mind.

56:01.066 --> 56:03.192
This is the clearest I've
been in a long time.

56:07.364 --> 56:08.531
I've done this before.

56:08.615 --> 56:11.993
- You haven't done it with me.
- No, I've done this before and I'm too old.

56:12.077 --> 56:13.828
We're the same damn age.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.346
That's perfect.

56:33.265 --> 56:34.640
That's unbelievable.

56:36.393 --> 56:40.480
Unbelievable. Okay. Great. This is good.

56:40.564 --> 56:42.940
This is perfect. I'm glad you said that
'cause this was a mistake.

56:43.275 --> 56:46.736
You're right. You know what?
I open up my heart to you and...

56:47.279 --> 56:49.822
Thank you,
because my head was turned around...

56:49.907 --> 56:52.408
- Jeff...
- But it ain't anymore.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.411
I think you're being a
little crazy about this.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.622
Yeah. I think you're crazy for saying no.

56:58.290 --> 56:59.582
Please go.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.464
I'm goin' by choice.

57:23.607 --> 57:25.566
Why are you sitting here?

57:25.651 --> 57:28.694
Why would you be sitting on your computer?
You are a young man.

57:28.779 --> 57:31.072
You got the whole world ahead of you.

57:31.156 --> 57:34.867
I'm asking you to be a man and try.

57:35.327 --> 57:38.037
Are you ready to have a crazy night with me?
'Cause I'm ready.

57:38.122 --> 57:40.373
- Say you're ready. Say you're ready.
- I'm ready.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.958
My man. Good answer.

57:43.293 --> 57:44.460
Let's do something stupid!

57:45.295 --> 57:46.629
Stay here.

57:58.517 --> 58:00.017
You guys ever partied in an Escalade?

58:00.644 --> 58:02.728
Here we go. Here we go. Drink. Drink.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.606
You drink. Open that up and start drinking,
I didn't buy it for nothing.

58:05.691 --> 58:06.858
Good girl.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.192
Go. Go.

58:09.695 --> 58:11.654
Drink, drink, drink.

58:25.335 --> 58:26.377
Arnau!

58:27.171 --> 58:30.047
This guy's getting laid tonight.
He's my best friend!

58:32.801 --> 58:35.720
Arnau! Pay the son of a bitch!

58:55.699 --> 58:56.866
You warm enough?

58:59.244 --> 59:01.329
This is all your stuff?

59:01.413 --> 59:03.164
Well, I just kind of set up here,

59:03.248 --> 59:06.918
the Boy Scouts don't really
come up here after September, so

59:07.252 --> 59:10.087
it's kind of like having a second home,

59:10.756 --> 59:12.715
come to spend some nights

59:13.550 --> 59:15.051
and clear the head.

59:17.763 --> 59:20.514
Okay. This is for you.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.100
I circled the location on the map,

59:23.185 --> 59:26.187
this way you'll always know
where to find the truck and this campsite.

59:27.731 --> 59:30.358
- Don't get lost.
- Okay.

59:33.612 --> 59:36.322
What's that? Is that a guitar?

59:36.406 --> 59:37.907
No, it's called a zither.

59:38.283 --> 59:39.700
Can you play this?

59:39.785 --> 59:42.203
Not very well at all.

59:42.287 --> 59:45.331
My dad had one, he was really good.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.541
Belinda really liked music, so...

59:47.626 --> 59:50.169
I always wished I could have
played her something,

59:50.254 --> 59:52.088
so I've been writing her this song
for when I see her again.

59:52.589 --> 59:53.798
Will you play it?

59:55.509 --> 59:56.717
- It's...
- Please?

59:56.802 --> 01:00:01.055
No, it's not finished
and it's really just not very good, so...

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.224
Well, I'll tell you if it's good or not.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:05.643
Okay.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.813
It's only halfway done,
so it's just like...

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.625
Stand straight

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.962
Fall back in line

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:36.507
Comb your hair

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:39.343
Get to work on time

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:46.225
Everyone in the big machine

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:49.979
Tries to break your heart

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.773
And pull you underneath

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.402
Maybe I'm wrong

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:00.823
And all that you get is what you see

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.284
Maybe I'm right

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:08.205
And there's something out there to believe

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.585
Everybody's talking in their sleep

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.466
They push a lot of air around

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.885
But don't say much of anything

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.264
Except when they laugh at me

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.391
Like ghosts under a sheet

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:36.400
Everybody's talking in their sleep

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.823
I messed up a bunch of parts,

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.117
- but that's basically what it is.
- No, it's so good.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.535
Shut up.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.121
So good.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.377
Thanks.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:58.756
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Anyway, you cold?

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:07.515
Trust me. Trust me.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.269
Now, feel this.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.108
It works, right?

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:47.221
What are you doing in the lobby?

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:48.514
Are they still in there?

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:50.850
Yeah, that's the point.
She's still in there.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.602
- You go.
- What do you mean I go?

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:56.063
I didn't want to hang out with these three.
I did it for you!

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:57.815
I don't think so. It's fine. You go.

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:00.609
- Are you gay?
- What? No...

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.695
- Is that what this is?
- No.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.613
I'm asking you seriously,
I'm not judging you.

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.740
You don't know this about me,
but I don't care about that stuff.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:08.534
No, Jeff, I'm not gay, no.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.870
This is set up perfectly.
Do you not think she's hot?

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.955
- You're acting like it's so easy.
- Because it is so easy.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.583
- No, Jeff. It's easy for you, not for me.
- Why not?

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:19.462
Because I'm not you, Jeff.
Do you just wanna see me get embarrassed?

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:21.672
No!

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.758
Arnau, come here, man. Come here.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:27.845
Fucking come here.
I'm not pranking you, man.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:31.098
You're not gonna get this opportunity
very much longer.

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:34.185
You're not always gonna be 21, young man.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.479
I promise you fucking that.

01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:40.316
I don't know. I don't know what to...
How do I start?

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.568
First of all, take these
pedophile glasses off

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:45.529
and don't wear these,
they make you look like a weirdo, man.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.324
I'm gonna put these on you. Holy shit!

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:49.992
Look at that killer.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.702
That dude right there crushes chicks.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.622
I would take a photo of you and show you
how good you looked right now,

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:55.915
'cause you look fantastic.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.292
- You look like a damn pilot.
- Okay.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:00.711
Like a cool pilot who drives jets.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.047
Pop this shit.

01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:07.384
Act like you've been there before.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.386
You're not gonna be your age forever.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:11.388
One day, you're gonna be the old dirtbag.

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:15.309
All by yourself.
This is the moment you live for.

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:16.393
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.187
Okay.

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.235
Hey, Halloween, you smoke?

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:55.826
- Yeah.
- Jeff, what the fuck?

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:57.786
It's so early, Bridget.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.831
Yeah, I'm working here.
Isn't that what you're doing down there?

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.125
Yes. That's what I'm doing.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.296
I've been going over the notes
that you've been sending in.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:11.967
This Belinda St. Sing, the ex-girlfriend
he said died in an accident.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:13.677
Is that her name?

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.971
Yeah, that's right. Why?

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.362
You're past curfew.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.948
- Were those girls with you?
- 100 % Arnau.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:38.661
Hey, you know that girl your boyfriend
was going back in time to save, Belinda?

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:39.745
Yeah?

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:43.957
Well, she's alive and well.
Lives about an hour away.

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:49.630
How? What do you mean?

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.382
Bridget called and set up an interview.

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:54.218
I think your little boyfriend
is seriously nuts.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.145
Yeah, I know, he's totally nuts.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.064
He's completely crazy. I know.

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:09.400
So she's alive. Okay.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.696
- I wanna do the interview.
- That's fine.

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:24.581
You sure you got this, kiddo?

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.543
Yeah?

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:47.813
- Darius?
- Hi.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:51.108
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:52.735
Come on in.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.571
I've never been interviewed
by a magazine before.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.158
He worked at Anderson's,

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.785
which was the restaurant I waited at
all throughout college,

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:03.704
and he was really nice.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:08.417
Different just than the
typical guys, I guess.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.169
So how long were you guys together?

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:15.507
Well, we were never really
together, together.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.594
You never dated?

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:22.430
I mean, I wouldn't call it dating.
He was...

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:25.975
He was one of those guys, who

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.145
you kind of know has a crush on you,

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.939
but he's really nice
and so you're really nice back.

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:36.987
But he wasn't the type of guy
who you could easily

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:41.992
fit into your life, you know,
with your friends and everything.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:43.660
He was

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:48.791
weird, I guess we've all
had one of those guys, right?

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:53.837
Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:58.841
So, then what happened?
Do you guys still talk?

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.928
After that, I started dating Rob,

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.139
who was my last boyfriend
before I met my husband,

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:07.434
and then Kenneth quit the restaurant.

01:09:07.519 --> 01:09:11.063
I didn't see him for a while after that.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.106
Then there was the accident.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:16.609
Accident?

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:21.657
Kenneth ran his car
into my boyfriend's house.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.826
There was a big dent
under the kitchen window.

01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:24.952
My God!

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:28.538
So I convinced Rob to just let him go
and we...

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.291
We told the police it was a hit and run.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:35.837
I haven't seen him since then.
But you said you've seen him recently.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:37.881
How is he?

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.553
He's good.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:01.363
Excuse me. Darius?

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.658
Can we have a moment of your time?

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:06.827
Nothing to be alarmed about.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:09.079
We'd just like to ask a few questions
about Kenneth Calloway.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.499
Guys? We're from Seattle Magazine.

01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:14.334
We're just here doing a story on this guy.

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:16.670
We're not involved
with what he's involved with.

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:17.838
What do you want with him?

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.507
He's been contacting government scientists
on the Internet,

01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:24.011
asking questions
about our particle accelerator in Berkeley.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:25.512
We've been investigating Calloway

01:10:25.597 --> 01:10:27.598
for a couple of years now
and we suspect him of being an agent.

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:28.765
He can't be a spy.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:32.352
He was arrested in Colorado for
breaking into a nuclear physics laboratory.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.606
And then there was the recent robbery
at a medical research center here.

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:36.940
Oh, yeah? And what did he take?

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.903
Are you sure it was him
that broke into the medical research place?

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.070
You have evidence?

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:43.906
We're confident.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.617
He hasn't been back to his house
in the past 24 hours.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.118
Give us a call if you hear from him?

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.620
Will do.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.456
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:57.294
So, what's your story about?

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.755
The story.

01:11:01.466 --> 01:11:03.300
I don't know anymore, actually.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:09.973
You all right?

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.605
You sure?

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:20.275
Yeah.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:30.994
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.134
Kenneth?

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.682
Kenneth? I'm coming in.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.734
Darius?

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.403
Hey. What are you doing here?

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.282
Everything's set.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.993
We move the machine to the launch site.
Departure is at 5:00 p.m.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:56.163
How'd you get in here anyway? The spooks
are all over me. It's crazy out there.

01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:57.581
I had to sneak in through the back.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.417
Hey, we need to talk.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.755
About last night. I know.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.051
Last night

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.720
was a thunderbolt.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.681
But I realize

01:13:14.766 --> 01:13:17.642
our working relationship
became complicated,

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:22.230
so for now, maybe we just
re-focus and concentrate on the mission.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:23.565
Whose house is this?

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:28.070
It's my house. My parents left it to me.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.405
Where are the lasers?
Can you show me the lasers?

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.116
What's wrong with your voice?

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:36.536
- Where's the time machine?
- The time machine is at the launch site.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.163
Oh, right, it's at the launch site.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.456
Darius.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.959
What are you doing?

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.129
I talked to those guys
who are following you.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:49.508
And they told me
that you stole those lasers because

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.260
you're some kind of spy or something.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:57.933
That's perfect. Let them think that, it
works in our favor. It's better. Seriously.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.268
I also talked to Belinda.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:03.980
- What?
- Yeah.

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:06.691
- You did not talk to Belinda.
- Yeah, I did.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.568
I talked to Belinda. I
was just at her house.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:09.986
No! No!

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.448
What are you doing?

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:22.290
She's alive! She's alive! Okay.

01:14:22.834 --> 01:14:24.668
This is good. Okay.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:29.631
This means the mission must have
been successful, and we have saved her

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:31.633
- and we've come back to the present...
- Hey, hey...

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:35.428
Hey, you can be honest with me, okay?

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.348
- I really like you.
- Okay.

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:40.267
Yes. But this is the thing.

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:43.895
It's a complicated science
and cannot be measured by our brains...

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.438
You can't time travel!

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:48.984
This is all crazy. Okay, you lied to me.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.528
- Listen to me.
- What else are you lying about?

01:14:51.863 --> 01:14:53.738
Hey, hey, listen to me.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.826
You come to that launch site at 5:00 p.m.,

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:02.789
you take my hand
and I'll show you who can't time travel.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:08.670
Oh, shit!

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:14.009
All right?

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:17.179
Darius! They're right behind the house!

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.014
- Wait...
- They're right behind me.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.640
Wait, you're with that guy?

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.685
- Are you...
- No.

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:26.271
- Were you making fun of me?
- No, I would have never...

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.647
Nobody was making fun of you, Kenneth.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:30.066
We are writing an honest piece
about you for a magazine.

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:31.902
Magazine? Darius, don't...

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:34.154
- We're not making fun of you.
- Get out of my house!

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:37.073
- We're on your side. We're here to help.
- No, I'm leaving tonight!

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:51.630
So is he really building
a time machine or what?

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.964
Why did you make me do this?

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.342
I didn't make you do this.
You wanted the story.

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:57.636
You don't care about the story!
You don't care about him.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.512
You just came here
to hook up with old girlfriends.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.890
- What's going on?
- Hey, guys, check this out.

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:03.099
It's open.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.739
Watch your head.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:23.203
I know what they were looking for.
I saw it, it was like a,

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:25.080
like a jet engine or something.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:37.926
It's gone!

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.724
Darius, have you seen this stuff before?

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.482
What the hell was he building in here?

01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:56.486
I don't know.

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:02.993
You don't think he
actually built it, do you?

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:05.161
Holy shit!

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:16.006
Move!

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:21.970
Darius!

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.585
Kenneth, I'm sorry.

01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:37.879
Were you making a joke of me
the whole time?

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:39.756
No.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:42.050
I promise.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:47.597
I lied about the story, but everything else
was real, okay? That was really me.

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:57.982
Then get on.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.407
Come with me.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:28.972
The mission's been updated.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.100
I'm going back for you now.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.105
All right. You trust me?

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:43.820
Come on.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:50.285
Take my hand. I know what I'm doing, okay?

01:19:56.292 --> 01:20:00.003
Flip that switch. Do it. Flip it down.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:23.359
Are you ready?

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:52.555
Go!

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.296
To go it alone or to go with a partner.

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:29.634
When you choose a partner, you have to
have compromises and sacrifices,

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:30.885
but it's the price you pay.

01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:34.514
Do I wanna follow my every whim and desire
as I make my way through time and space?

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:35.598
Absolutely.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:39.477
But at the end of the day, do I
need someone when I'm doubting myself,

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.563
and I'm insecure and my heart's failing me?

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:44.983
Do I need someone who,
when the heat gets hot, has my back?

01:21:45.442 --> 01:21:48.111
- So, do you?
- I do.
