Hello, Claire.

to surrender.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.796
Really? Why?

To protect his family.

himself over

00:33.075 --> 00:35.327
Peter, she's going to kill
thousands of people.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.571
It will be a bloodbath.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.744
Tell me exactly
what you saw.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.537
You cannot save her.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.536
But someone else can.

00:45.171 --> 00:47.833
Don’t worry.
I’m here to save you.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.466

MATT: / went inside his head
and / trapped him
in his worst nightmare.

He'll never hurt
anyone again.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.058
No. No, you can't do that.

01:01.145 --> 01:02.351
You go into his head,
you might not come out.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.392

02:44.332 --> 02:46.118
Is that really you?

02:52.298 --> 02:54.630
I came to get you
out of here.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.341
It is you, isn't it?

03:02.933 --> 03:06.221
I thought I was alone here,
that everyone was dead.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.676
What are you
doing here?

03:07.772 --> 03:09.353
I came to drag
your sorry ass
out of here.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.976
Now, let's go.

03:11.609 --> 03:14.146
(SCOFFING)
There is no getting
out of here, Peter.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.646
I've tried.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.562
For three years.

03:17.656 --> 03:21.774
Three years?
What are you talking about?
It's been three hours.

03:23.662 --> 03:29.157
Wait a minute.
You're not really here.
You're not real.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.494
This is my mind,
isn't it?

03:33.381 --> 03:37.090
This is my mind playing
tricks on me as part of
my punishment, isn't it?

03:37.176 --> 03:39.883
You think I'm gonna
let you taunt me?

03:40.596 --> 03:42.132
You stay away.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.635
If you follow me,
I will kill you.
Do you understand me?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.846
Sylar!

03:57.822 --> 03:59.687
I swear I'll kill you.
Get out of my head!

03:59.782 --> 04:01.318
Calm down.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.400
I'm telling you
the truth.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.736
I came to take you
out of here.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.953
Why do you keep
saying that?

04:09.041 --> 04:12.124
I went to Parkman's house
to look for you.
He put you here.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.496
This is a dream.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.997
No, it's not a dream!

04:16.298 --> 04:17.799
This is real.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.167
You really don't
understand that this is
all just a nightmare?

04:21.262 --> 04:23.548
Hell, yes,
it's a nightmare.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.764
Three years
completely alone.

04:26.851 --> 04:29.012
Not years, hours.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.182
All right? Parkman
trapped you here.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.107
Parkman?
That's impossible.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.397
IS it?

04:36.735 --> 04:40.193
What's the last thing
you remember
before coming here?

04:41.532 --> 04:45.116
I remember wanting
my life to change.

04:46.871 --> 04:49.328
Thinking lwas
going to spend
all of eternity alone.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.155
Exactly.
And here you are.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.754
Why would you
want to do that?

04:58.883 --> 05:01.966
The brother of
the man | murdered
coming to my aid?

05:02.052 --> 05:04.384
Because I need
you to help me.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.723
Look, I could leave
you here to rot,

05:10.394 --> 05:13.978
but I need you
to save her,
my friend, Emma.

05:14.398 --> 05:18.562
In the dream, you save her
before she kills
thousands of people.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.812
No.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.896
You got the wrong guy.
I'm not the savior kind.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.321
You should know that
better than anybody.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.571
It's gonna happen,
and you're gonna save her.

out of here?

Let me see you try.
Go ahead.

05:52.811 --> 05:53.971
See?

05:55.314 --> 05:59.683
We're not going anywhere.
We're trapped here, forever.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.809

06:38.774 --> 06:40.685
He's safe. Unharmed.

06:41.277 --> 06:42.562
Which is more
than he deserves

aﬁershooﬂng
into a crowd
of innocent people.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.613
My dad didn't shoot anyone.
If he had, you would be dead.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.316
You're not that naive,
are you, Claire?

06:50.411 --> 06:53.949
Your father came to
this carnival with a gun,
intent on using it.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.825
Isn't that why you
tried to negotiate
my surrender?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.781
Because you were afraid
he was gonna do
something like this?

06:57.876 --> 07:00.333
No. I want to see
my father now.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.664
Your devotion
to your father
is touching,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.544
but you're blinded by it.

07:06.677 --> 07:10.261
It's time for you to open
your eyes and see your
father for who he really is.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.382
I know who he is.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.681
And nothing you say
to me is going
to change that.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.348
Of course not.
That's why I'm going
to show you.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.503
Damian has the ability
to reveal
a person's memories.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.582
It's fairly painless
if you don't fight it.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.672
You think showing me
my dad's memories
is going to enlighten me?

07:52.890 --> 07:56.098
Let her go, Samuel.
You don't need her anymore.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.927
You're afraid
she'll see the real you,
Bennet?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.808
Don't do this.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.148
Take a peek, Claire.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.569
See where it all began.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.741
All right, now, this one
has it all. Whitewalls,
wire wheel covers,

08:18.832 --> 08:20.493

08:24.254 --> 08:25.539
Hundred-and-fifty

I know. That's...
That's kind of steep.
Right, look...

08:35.307 --> 08:37.013
You didn't hear
this from me,

08:37.101 --> 08:39.934
but you guys should
go to Val's Discount Motors
on La Cienega.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.760
They've got the same model,
maybe a year older.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.267
Probably half of what
you'll pay here.

Thanks. We really
appreciate that.

Long, supple fingers.

It's my wife.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.633
What are you doing here?

09:13.804 --> 09:14.919
I just thought
I'd come by

09:15.013 --> 09:17.345
and see how the world's
most handsome
salesman is doing.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.681
Well, if I see him,
I'll ask him.

09:19.810 --> 09:24.474

has to pay the rent.

some unexpected news.

you won't get mad.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.714
I'm pregnant.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.423
I know. I know.
We didn't plan this.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.846

want to be the man
with the plan.

wife and family?

I never told you.

least bit curious

to your father's
first wife?

10:40.641 --> 10:44.008
No. No, it's his business.
If he wanted me to know...

10:44.102 --> 10:47.060
There are reasons
he kept it secret from you,
Claire. Isn't that right?

10:47.147 --> 10:51.140
You let her go.
You got what you wanted,
someone to blame. Me.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.476
Look at the fear
in his eyes.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.270
He knows what's coming.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.826

with Damian.

very informative, Claire.

order pot stickers?

for two now.

You and me, parents.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.299

11:21.431 --> 11:22.967
I have no idea.

He couldn't make it.

do I owe you?

14:27.117 --> 14:29.574
I don't know. Maybe you
read it somewhere and
it's in your subconscious.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.367
Yeah, well,
I didn't read 9th Wonders!

14:31.455 --> 14:32.865
Idid.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.571
So now we're in your head?
I don't know!

14:34.666 --> 14:37.453
I don't know how
this all works.

14:37.836 --> 14:38.871
Don't you wanna
get out of here?

14:38.962 --> 14:41.078
Yeah. Of course.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.881
You don't, do you?

14:46.344 --> 14:47.675
You don't want
to get out of here.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.880
Maybe I deserve
all this aloneness.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.719
This nothing.
Maybe I earned it.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.061
Yeah, maybe you have.

14:55.145 --> 14:58.512
But I can't do this
on my own.
I need you to help me.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.517
Okay?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.282
All right, Peter.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.283
You want me to help you?

15:20.295 --> 15:21.876
I want to help.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.671
(SIGHING)

15:26.009 --> 15:28.091
Where did that come from?

15:32.641 --> 15:35.678
That's the wall from
Parkman's basement.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.809
What's it
doing here?

15:42.526 --> 15:43.766
This is our way out.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.895
SYLAR: What?

15:45.028 --> 15:48.020
Don't you get it?
We have to break through.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.384
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

16:25.026 --> 16:26.607
Can I help you?

16:28.155 --> 16:29.895
l was just leaving.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.360
You're hurt.
Let me see.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.236
I'm a doctor. Please.

16:44.546 --> 16:48.038
You don't have to do this.
I don't want you to get
in trouble.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.875
I have a hearing loss.
Say that again.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.796
My name is Lauren.
I came here to stop
Samuel Sullivan.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.847
You're with the man
who shot everybody.

16:57.934 --> 16:58.969
Bennet

16:59.060 --> 17:01.221
Bennetnever
fired his gun.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.388
Your leader, Samuel,
is not what he appears
to be.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.564
He's the one responsible.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.600
He wouldn't shoot
his own people.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.027
You're wrong.
He's done terrible things,

17:11.114 --> 17:14.572
and now he's trying
to galvanize his people
around a common enemy.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.399
SAMUEL:
I gotta check in
with the doc.

17:16.494 --> 17:19.281
Samuel is coming.
Don't tell him I'm here.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.880
Everything all right?

18:24.854 --> 18:26.139
(SIGHING)

18:26.898 --> 18:28.513
It's all right.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.016
I just want to talk.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.864
Well, look what
we have here.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.114
Your first wife
was murdered
by a special?

18:46.084 --> 18:47.290
Yeah.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.040
It was a long time ago.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.716
And the person I was then
died that night with Kate.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.800
(CLEARING THROAT)

19:01.891 --> 19:04.473
I'm sorry I never
told you, Claire.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.395
That's okay.

19:07.605 --> 19:11.063
Some things
you just can't
say out loud.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.645
But that's the reason
why you joined the Company.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.733
That's how you became
Mr. Bag-and-Tag.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.112
No. I don't need
to see any more.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.239
(SIGHING)

20:28.812 --> 20:30.222
Don't move.

20:33.483 --> 20:34.768
What, you want
my wallet? Take it.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.066
I said don't move.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.312
I'm not after your money.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.408
What, then?

20:42.659 --> 20:46.868
Information. I know
what you are. I know
what you can do.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.322
How?
It doesn't matter.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.874
I'm looking
for somebody.
One of you.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.917
One of me? What?
What are you
talking about?

20:58.007 --> 20:59.747
You mean,
there's someone
else like me?

20:59.843 --> 21:01.708
Don't give me that.

21:01.845 --> 21:05.383
What you do isn't normal.
You have to know each other.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.181
The guy I'm looking
for is named Richard.

21:08.268 --> 21:12.511
He's about six feet tall,
got dark hair,
maybe 23 years old.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.096
He can move things
with his mind.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.606
He killed my wife.

21:19.863 --> 21:23.105
I don't know
anyone else like me.
I swear.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.365
I don't believe you.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.292
(PANTING)

22:11.581 --> 22:13.117
It was an accident.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.288
You brought a gun.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.502
I didn't know
what I would find.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.076
I was scared.

22:18.963 --> 22:22.046
That's the first time
you killed anyone, huh?

22:26.429 --> 22:28.169
What happens next?

22:35.855 --> 22:39.518
One owner, low miles.
Hottest car
I got in the lot.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.315
It's the best I can do.
So take it or leave it.

22:41.402 --> 22:42.733
Well, I thought you said...
If you don't want it,

22:42.820 --> 22:45.482
I got another buyer
over here just
chomping at the bit.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.484
What's it going to be?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.818
I guess we'll take it.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.323
Excellent choice.

22:53.414 --> 22:56.030
I'll have my manager
draw up the papers.
Excuse me.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.668
Hey, there.
Can I interest you
in a car?

23:00.755 --> 23:02.120
Not really.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.165
I'm here to offer you a job.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.295
Do I know you?

23:06.386 --> 23:08.217
We've been
watching you.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.421
The way you killed
that special,
the repairman.

23:11.516 --> 23:15.475
We'd been tracking him,
too, only you got
there first. Relax.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.397
Your secret is
safe with us.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.392
We're impressed.

23:20.483 --> 23:24.021
So impressed, in fact,
we'd like you to
come work for us.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.231
Who are you?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.187
My name is Thompson.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.284
My associates and I can
help you find the man
who killed your wife.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.703
And then
you can help us
find the rest.

23:41.129 --> 23:45.372
How's it working out for you,
the "one of us, one of them"?

23:46.175 --> 23:48.587
To tell you the truth,
it's been quite
an adjustment.

23:48.678 --> 23:51.044
I mean,
Claude can go invisible
any time he wants.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.504
It gives him
a distinct advantage.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.260
Advantage?

23:54.350 --> 23:56.341
You're supposed
to be partners.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.727
What is it?
Trust issues?

23:59.814 --> 24:02.851
I mean,
how could it not be?
He's abnormal.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.440
I mean, sometimes,
when I'm alone,

24:05.528 --> 24:09.897
I get this feeling in my gut
that he's watching me,
you know what I mean?

24:09.991 --> 24:12.107
Yeah. I do.

24:13.036 --> 24:16.153
You know, your case is
highly unusual, Bennet.

24:16.623 --> 24:20.411
How you came to
our attention, what
happened to your wife.

24:21.377 --> 24:25.120
It would be only natural
that you would
harbor a grudge.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.001
What are you getting at?

24:28.092 --> 24:32.586
Seventeen cases,
three deaths.
All attributed to you.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.797
They were all accidents.
That's been verified.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.803
WAITRESS: Two corned beefs.
You boys need anything else?

24:37.894 --> 24:40.101
No, we're all set. Thanks.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.774
At this point, the Company
has too much invested
in you to cut ties,

24:49.864 --> 24:52.480
but we do need you
to make a change.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.568
Take a wife.
Start a family.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.661
Is that a joke?

24:58.748 --> 25:02.491
No. It'll put
your life in balance,
calm you down,

25:03.503 --> 25:05.994
so there will be
fewer incidents.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.329
A Wife?

25:09.092 --> 25:10.298
I can't do that again.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.750
Sure you can.

25:12.929 --> 25:16.592
That cute number who brought
the sandwiches will do fine.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.314
And if I refuse?

25:30.405 --> 25:31.770
You won't.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.703
It's like the Company
arranged your marriage.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.501
They encouraged me,
but I chose your mother
because I loved her.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.203
You know that.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.209
The Company seems
to make a lot
of decisions for you.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.916
Made. They made
a lot of decisions,
and that's all over with.

25:54.011 --> 25:57.378
Everything you're seeing now,
all of it, all of the
memories, that's all they are.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.259
It's just the past.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.603
Hello, Gretchen.

26:15.158 --> 26:18.241
Hey, Mr. Bennet,
what are you doing here?

26:18.703 --> 26:23.242
I came to see Claire.
You wouldn't happen to know
where she is, would you?

26:23.332 --> 26:24.663
Noidea.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.253
You don't have
to lie for her.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.590
I know that Claire
stole the compass,

26:34.677 --> 26:38.169
and lwould bet good money
the two of you drove out
to the carnival together.

26:38.306 --> 26:41.514
My question is,
why didn't she come
back with you?

26:44.103 --> 26:47.391
She wanted to stay.
She said she'd be
back on Monday.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.188
You left her there?

26:49.317 --> 26:51.433
Do you not see
what's happening?

26:51.527 --> 26:53.358
That she is getting
involved in something

26:53.446 --> 26:55.562
that she clearly
doesn't understand?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.738
Maybe she wants
to understand it.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.573
This isn't a game.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.276
These carnival people
are killers.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.454
You don't think I know that?
She needs to be
with people like her.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.157
If they're not good
for her, you have to trust
her to know the difference.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.537
You have to stop
encouraging her.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.620
You need to work
with me on this,
Gretchen.

27:11.714 --> 27:12.794
I want her to be happy.

27:12.882 --> 27:17.216
She is happy with you,
here, in college,
living a normal life.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.173
What if that's not
enough for her?

27:20.264 --> 27:21.765
It has to be.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.887
What's he doing here?

27:30.608 --> 27:32.940
Are you gonna erase
my memory?

27:36.572 --> 27:37.687
No.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.279
Not if you do what I ask.

27:45.832 --> 27:46.867
You were missing.

27:46.958 --> 27:49.165
I didn't know
how to find you,
if I would find you.

27:49.252 --> 27:50.207
You don't trust me.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.159
I don't trust Samuel.

27:52.255 --> 27:53.335
And Gretchen is fine.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.798
You threatened her.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.124
And this was not
some distant past.
This was now.

27:58.219 --> 28:00.084
Claire! Claire!

28:20.283 --> 28:22.444
Hey! You should eat.

28:22.994 --> 28:27.784
Don't need to eat.
Don't need to sleep.
Don't need anything.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.664
Any progress today?

28:35.590 --> 28:38.081
(PANTING) No.

28:38.175 --> 28:41.212
It's just like yesterday,
and the day before that.

28:41.304 --> 28:45.138
And the day before that.

28:45.683 --> 28:48.925
Now, it's been...
I don't even know
how long it's been.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.932
Don't tell me
how long it's been.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.012
Can't even dent it, Peter.

28:53.107 --> 28:55.268
I don't know
how much longer
you can keep this up.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.145
As long as it takes.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.861
I know that look.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.159
You have it all the time.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.650
What look?

29:06.954 --> 29:08.945
Like when Howie Kaplan
beat you at
the 50-yard dash,

29:09.040 --> 29:10.530
and you and I ran
to school every morning

29:10.625 --> 29:13.412
and kept training,
and kept it up, right?

29:13.502 --> 29:16.244
That's Nathan's memory.
That's not yours.

29:16.672 --> 29:20.164
I told you to stop
doing that.

29:21.052 --> 29:22.588
You're not him.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.921
You're nothing like him.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.469
So you've told me.

29:37.652 --> 29:41.065
Look, Peter, I know that
I've said it before, but...

29:45.868 --> 29:47.199
I'm sorry.

29:49.038 --> 29:52.576
I'm sorry that I killed him.
I'm sorry that I took him
from you. I'm...

29:52.667 --> 29:56.706
Sorry! You keep saying that.
"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"

29:57.046 --> 29:59.662
It's not gonna bring
my brother back!

29:59.757 --> 30:00.963
ltdoesnt
change anything.

30:01.050 --> 30:04.042
You're right!
Nothing changes!

30:05.930 --> 30:08.637
We're stuck here forever.
You and me.

30:18.943 --> 30:21.025
I can't take it anymore.

30:31.455 --> 30:35.118
You're with that Company.
Cut from the same
cloth as Bennet.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.912
This doesn't have
to end badly for you.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.540
You can turn yourself in.
Release Bennet
and his daughter.

30:39.630 --> 30:40.619
Why would I want
to do that?

30:40.715 --> 30:41.830
Because you love
your family

30:41.924 --> 30:44.757
and you don't want them
to get hurt. And
they will get hurt.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.551
You people are always
so sure of yourselves.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.845
Don't you think I would
know what's best
for my own family?

30:49.932 --> 30:51.217
And what is that?

30:51.308 --> 30:52.639
Change.

30:52.727 --> 30:56.015
We're strong enough
to show ourselves,
take what's rightfully ours.

30:56.105 --> 30:58.471
You don't have
the right to take
anything.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.147
Of course we do.

31:00.735 --> 31:03.067
We deserve
admiration, respect.

31:04.613 --> 31:07.104
And you intend
to hurt people
to get it?

31:07.199 --> 31:09.360
What would you have me do?

31:10.327 --> 31:12.363
Continue with this life?

31:14.331 --> 31:16.117
Live in a carnival?

31:16.459 --> 31:19.292
Why not?
You've lived here
happily for years.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.710
Wasted years,
unfulfilled years.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.503
I could have been
so much more.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.465
You know about me?

31:27.470 --> 31:28.801
About the film?

31:31.724 --> 31:34.682
Do you know
how powerful
I can really be

31:36.020 --> 31:38.136
if I brought them all here?

31:39.565 --> 31:42.523
My brother said
I could move mountains,
cities.

31:42.610 --> 31:44.396
I wonder, is it true?

31:45.571 --> 31:47.527
Can I change the world?

31:49.033 --> 31:51.490
(SOFTLY) I hope to God
we never find out.

31:55.748 --> 31:58.330
What did the world
ever do to you?

31:59.376 --> 32:01.662
Should've treated me better.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.336
Don't do this, please.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.253
Samuel?

32:13.432 --> 32:16.014
The Bennet girl left
the House of Mirrors.

32:16.102 --> 32:19.094
Well, we'll just have
to have a word with her.

32:21.232 --> 32:23.598
It's time
to gather the family.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.559
Tell them to pack up.
We're moving on to
bigger and better things.

32:26.654 --> 32:30.272
Tell them it's gonna be
the greatest show
we've ever done.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.826
You've been quite
helpful, Lauren.

32:32.910 --> 32:36.903
Eli, you and your friends
take care of her, would you?
Thanks.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.380
What are you gonna do?

32:54.557 --> 32:56.388
I'm gonna end this.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.809
I can't bring
Nathan back, Peter,

33:04.900 --> 33:07.562
but I can sure as hell
swing a sledgehammer.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.870
I'm sorry to put you
through that, Claire.

33:23.961 --> 33:25.542
But I hope through
this painful experience,

33:25.629 --> 33:28.416
you can finally
see the truth.

33:29.592 --> 33:30.752
Yeah.

33:32.261 --> 33:35.628
You were right, Samuel.
My dad is a bad guy.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.673
I belong with you.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.260
You're my hero.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.188
That's what you
want to hear, right?

33:46.275 --> 33:48.982
That's what
this is all about?

33:50.112 --> 33:54.276
Why didn't you show me
the memory my dad has
of shooting Lydia, huh?

33:55.618 --> 33:56.983
Or was that just
not on the program?

33:57.077 --> 33:59.454
Maybe he didn't pull
the trigger last night,

33:59.538 --> 34:01.449
but does that negate
all the times that he has?

34:01.540 --> 34:03.451
Your father, to this day,
lies to you,

34:05.461 --> 34:06.917
because he can't
trust any of us.

34:07.004 --> 34:10.167
You actually thought
that I would turn on him?

34:11.008 --> 34:13.841
You just
don't understand,
do you, huh?

34:14.637 --> 34:17.720
Maybe it was 'cause no one
ever really loved you.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.890
You call these people
your family, but they're not.
They fear you.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.014
Give me my dad,
and we're leaving.

34:25.147 --> 34:28.480
No.Sony
You're too important
to me, Claire.

34:29.151 --> 34:31.107
Especially now,
when everything's
ready to change.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.060
What's going on?
Where's everyone going?

34:33.155 --> 34:36.443
l was talking to a new friend
about who I am, what I can be.

34:36.533 --> 34:39.900
And the way
she looked at me,
she was so afraid.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.782
I want to see that look again,
a thousand times over.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.374
Meaning what?

34:45.834 --> 34:48.450
It's time for our
biggest show ever.

34:48.671 --> 34:50.411
No more hiding
in the shadows.

34:50.506 --> 34:53.168
It's time to show
ourselves, be strong.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.295
We're going to New York City.

34:55.386 --> 34:57.126
Bring the whole place
to Central Park.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.587
Then we'll show them
how powerful we are.

34:59.682 --> 35:01.468
You can't do that.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.220
Some lives will
unfortunately be lost,

35:03.310 --> 35:04.925
but they will learn
to fear us, respect us.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.100
It's what we've
always wanted.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.645
I have never wanted that.

35:09.066 --> 35:12.854
Claire, you will
inherit this new world.
It's your legacy.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.439
And you will remind them
of what I've done
long after I've gone.

35:15.531 --> 35:18.398
That's why it's so
important for you to be
a part of our family.

35:18.534 --> 35:21.025
You are desperate.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.743
And you're small.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.118
I will never be
a part of your family.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.291
You sound just
like your father.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.289
I had so hoped
to convince you.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.871
Maybe in time
you'll change your mind.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.214
Don't hold your breath.

35:36.719 --> 35:37.879
Right.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.088
Your father's back
in the souvenir trailer.

35:46.895 --> 35:50.058
I had a little trouble
with the government lady.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.936
We were playing
some cat and mouse,
but the mouse got away.

35:53.027 --> 35:53.982
So you want me
to go find her?

35:54.069 --> 35:55.149
Not worth it.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.569
Everything okay?
It will be.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.240
Claire Bennet
needs some time
to think about my offer.

36:02.244 --> 36:05.077
I'm going to give her
that opportunity.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.418
Claire,

36:18.427 --> 36:20.213
I want to explain
what you saw.

36:20.471 --> 36:22.507
We'll talk about it later.

36:23.766 --> 36:25.381
(RUMBLING)

36:27.478 --> 36:28.968
What is that?

36:51.668 --> 36:55.160
Now, I'm ready to go.
New York City.

36:55.631 --> 36:56.996
Sounds fun.

36:57.466 --> 36:58.876
It Will be.

36:59.468 --> 37:02.050
I'm afraid you have
to join us later.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.219
There's some
loose ends
to attend to.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.423
Before Lydia died,
she spoke of people

37:07.518 --> 37:09.884
who want to interfere
with our plans.

37:10.479 --> 37:13.562
I'll need you
to stop them.
Permanently.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.343
Happy Birthday.

37:45.848 --> 37:47.759
It's not my birthday.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.260
Yeah. I know.

37:49.351 --> 37:52.013
You just wore out
your other copy,

37:52.104 --> 37:54.095
and I saw that one
digging around.

37:57.776 --> 38:01.439
I appreciate you
being patient with me.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.396
Keeping me sane.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.158
It's very kind of you,
Peter. Thank you.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.324
You want to know
something weird?

38:17.713 --> 38:19.044
Every time you
pick that thing up,

38:19.131 --> 38:22.123
I think you're going
to hit me with it,
really hard.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.128
That is weird.
Because every time
I pick it up,

38:24.219 --> 38:27.632
lfeel like I'm gonna
hit you with it, too,
really hard.

38:27.723 --> 38:28.963
VVhy?

38:31.518 --> 38:33.725
Because you are
who you are.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.557
I wish I could accept
your apologies.
But if I forgive you,

38:40.360 --> 38:42.737
then I'm not doing
right by him.

38:42.863 --> 38:44.069
Nathan.

38:45.741 --> 38:49.780
If you let go of your anger,
you're afraid you'll
lose him forever?

38:50.996 --> 38:53.738
So you've held on to it
this entire time?

38:54.917 --> 38:57.033
lfeel it slipping away,

38:58.170 --> 39:01.503
but when I look at you
and I see you killing him.

39:02.549 --> 39:05.040
You took my brother
away from me.

39:06.512 --> 39:09.879
We've been here
for I don't know
how many years,

39:10.265 --> 39:11.596
together.

39:12.226 --> 39:13.636
I've changed.
I've repented.

39:13.727 --> 39:16.560
I'm never going to hurt
anyone ever again.

39:17.564 --> 39:20.772
And all this time,
you were afraid
to let me out.

39:23.737 --> 39:24.943
Peter.

39:27.908 --> 39:30.945
I'm not that guy
anymore, Peter.
You know that.

39:34.623 --> 39:35.908
I know.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.455
I know you're not.

40:32.347 --> 40:33.962
(COUGHING)

40:49.698 --> 40:51.609
How long has
it been, really?

40:51.908 --> 40:53.694
Half a day, maybe.

40:54.286 --> 40:57.028
Feels like
we were in there
for years.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.456
Yeah.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.037
Does that make it
any less real?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.458
Let's go save Emma.

41:07.549 --> 41:08.755
Yeah.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.921
Sorry to break up
the love fest,

41:16.016 --> 41:19.258
but I'm here
to make sure that
that doesn't happen.

41:51.468 --> 41:52.708
(BOTH SIGHING)

41:52.803 --> 41:54.293
CLAIRE:
There's no signal.

41:54.388 --> 41:55.924
Claire.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.003
You're all right?

41:57.099 --> 41:58.179
Yeah. You?

41:58.266 --> 42:00.928
Yeah. Here, help me
get these ropes off.

42:01.687 --> 42:04.099
(BOTH GRUNTING)

42:05.941 --> 42:08.102
Is that a lantern
over there?

42:17.744 --> 42:18.824
We're buried.

42:18.912 --> 42:20.573
How far down
do you think we are?

42:22.124 --> 42:24.285
Felt like we dropped
40 or 50 feet.

42:25.919 --> 42:27.250
Hello?

42:28.672 --> 42:30.003
(GROANING)
Anybody hear us?

42:30.090 --> 42:32.627
CLAIRE: Help!
Can anybody hear us?

42:33.427 --> 42:34.883
Somebody get us out!
