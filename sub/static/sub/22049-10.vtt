00:03.260 --> 00:04.960
Is William home?

00:04.960 --> 00:09.740
Girls believe he's good deep down.
That he's going to be better for them.

00:10.680 --> 00:15.260
You're standing here. While he's out there
somewhere sleeping with someone else.

00:19.700 --> 00:24.380
<i>[Fuck I lost my phone between the bus seats yesterday, and
only found it today. I'm in Lillehammer but it's shit and I miss
you so much. Can we please be done with the space stuff soon?]</i>

00:28.240 --> 00:30.500
My brother is a complete psychopath.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.340
Psychopath?

01:17.980 --> 01:31.300
<i>[Want to pop out to Bygdøy and take the first swim of the year?
No, it's not too cold, come on. I'll make cocoa and pick you up in 30.]</i>

01:39.960 --> 01:50.260
<i>[Don't you have Russ stuff today?]</i>

01:50.340 --> 01:57.680
<i>[..?]</i>

02:13.160 --> 02:21.760
<i>[I just mean that you have to remember to have fun in
the last few days! You're only a Russ once in your life.]</i>

02:21.800 --> 02:31.780
<i>[I want to be with you.]</i>

02:46.400 --> 02:58.440
<i>[But I'm sick. I think I have a fever.]</i>

02:58.440 --> 03:10.440
<i>[Okay. Do you need anything?]</i>

03:17.240 --> 03:23.080
<i>[No thanks. I'm fine.]</i>

03:26.080 --> 03:27.320
I'm sleeping.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.820
Ah good, you're awake!

03:32.680 --> 03:33.800
What is it?

03:46.820 --> 03:49.420
We've made breakfast in bed for you...

03:49.940 --> 03:55.020
... to show you that we love you and
to apologise for always leeching off of you.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.520
I'm not hungry.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.560
Yeah, but you can just a eat a little bit.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.300
Eskild, I said I wasn't hungry!

04:29.800 --> 04:31.860
I'm gonna lie down again.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.720
What's wrong?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.200
Is it William?

05:14.980 --> 05:17.180
I just have the flu.

05:27.740 --> 05:30.280
You know you don't have
to face everything in the world on your own?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.660
It's just a fever.

05:43.220 --> 05:44.560
It'll pass.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.240
Okay.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.200
I'll give you two days.

06:46.140 --> 06:54.720
[Why do you never answer in the chat? You're coming to the 17th of
May (Norway's Constitution Day) breakfast at my place tomorrow, right?

07:36.180 --> 07:46.600
<i>[I have to know what happened last Friday.]</i>

08:01.640 --> 08:07.580
<i>[Noora! You were so quiet! Meet me.
Then we'll drink beer and talk about it. My treat.]</i>

08:33.040 --> 08:39.140
<i>[Ok. At a public café in one hour.]</i>

08:53.860 --> 08:55.020
<i>[Public café? All cafés are public.]</i>

08:57.780 --> 08:59.740
Please don't hate me...

09:12.400 --> 09:13.580
What are you doing here?

09:15.700 --> 09:18.900
I'm trying to find out why you've
locked yourself inside for three days.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.620
I'm sick.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.000
I'm sick.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.220
Why don't you want to talk to me?

09:44.140 --> 09:49.020
Because it's just... there's just
a few hours of your Russ time left.

09:49.060 --> 09:53.560
You have to... I want
you to go out and celebrate and...

09:55.920 --> 09:58.920
... to have fun with your friends.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.440
You don't have to
waste your time on me.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.100
What's this fuss about Russ time?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.520
Fuck that.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.320
It's not that important.

10:20.660 --> 10:23.920
It's just once in your
life that you're a Russ.

10:33.580 --> 10:36.280
If you don't want to be with me..,

10:41.280 --> 10:43.800
... then you need to
have the fucking guts to say it.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.160
I do want to be with you!

10:59.600 --> 11:03.500
But I have to write an article...

11:03.780 --> 11:06.440
... which I should have handed in yesterday.

11:07.180 --> 11:13.940
I can't write it, because I can't think.
Because I can't sleep!

11:14.280 --> 11:19.900
Do you understand? It's just
because my heart is jumping out of my chest.

11:22.040 --> 11:27.360
No, but I can't breathe!
It feels as if I'm going to die.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.060
You're not gonna die.

11:44.900 --> 11:45.700
I promise.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.820
You're just anxious.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.200
We just have to get
you to relax a little, okay?

12:18.540 --> 12:23.060
No, but I can't relax. Don't you see?

12:23.100 --> 12:26.200
That article is really important.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.780
I have to hand it in.

12:35.500 --> 12:39.160
Noora, you don't have to do anything.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.340
Don't look at me
while I'm sleeping.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.220
Good reply.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.700
You slept for 15 hours.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.800
How do you feel?

18:47.880 --> 18:50.140
NOORA

18:52.480 --> 18:54.860
Okay, world's ... person..

18:56.540 --> 19:00.940
You should be at Eva's 17th of
May breakfast in 30 minutes. I'll drive you.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.120
I can't bear that now.

19:09.660 --> 19:14.180
You're not better off lying here.
You have to go out with your friends.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.420
I found a dress for you.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.460
I can't go in that one.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.320
I wore it to a Christmas ball in the eighth grade.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.460
It's really ugly.

19:38.140 --> 19:39.020
Huh?

19:39.700 --> 19:40.940
No, it's really nice.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.700
Call me if something happens, okay?

20:33.940 --> 20:35.080
You promise?

20:56.220 --> 20:57.640
There's some stuff...

21:00.440 --> 21:01.960
... that I have to find out.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.800
Before I can tell you.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.320
Just tell me when you're ready.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.620
Love you.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.340
I love you too.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.520
Happy Constitution Day!

22:43.020 --> 22:44.720
Happy Constitution Day.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.480
New dress?

22:51.700 --> 22:54.840
Cheers again!
Oh my god.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.740
The 17th of May is my favorite day!

22:57.740 --> 23:02.680
You start the day with alcohol,
you end the day with alcohol.

23:02.760 --> 23:06.140
You spend the entire day with alcohol.

23:07.080 --> 23:11.220
How much ice cream
do you eat during the 17th of May?

23:11.260 --> 23:12.640
How much ice cream?

23:12.720 --> 23:14.280
Ice cream or sausages.
-I eat 15.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.400
15?!
-At least!

23:17.520 --> 23:20.820
I'm not kidding. We have to eat ice cream.
-Krone ice cream?

23:20.940 --> 23:24.200
How many did you eat today?
-Five.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.100
You ate five ice creams?
-Yeah.

23:31.160 --> 23:36.040
The Russ parade is
in like two hours.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.640
I'll wave to many.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.640
Oh! Oh!

23:42.260 --> 23:44.700
Cheers to you.
-Yeah, cheers to you!

23:45.460 --> 23:47.080
Finish that glass.

23:52.420 --> 23:54.140
Should I hand you some food?

23:57.920 --> 24:00.980
No, thanks. I have a
bit of a stomach ache today.

24:13.460 --> 24:18.300
It's so nice that you could all
come to my 17th of May breakfast today.

24:18.880 --> 24:23.440
I love you all. You know that,
that's not why I'm giving a speech.

24:24.100 --> 24:28.580
I want to say, Noora...

24:29.700 --> 24:31.840
Fucking hell, how clever you are.

24:32.480 --> 24:36.000
I thought I should read your article.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.920
As some kind of speech for today.

24:40.620 --> 24:43.380
Youthful freedom and responsibility.

24:43.740 --> 24:46.960
By Noora Amalie Saætre. 17 years old.

24:48.360 --> 24:55.680
Norwegian youth spend more than four hours a day
on social media, according to a study.

24:56.120 --> 25:01.780
Some believe it's a waste of time,
but I understand why we do it very well.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.760
Society is straightforward on social media.

25:06.200 --> 25:10.000
Where you can just log off,
or block everything you don't like.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.060
Today, we celebrate our constitution.

25:14.500 --> 25:20.920
It says that everyone has equal rights,
and that humas are born free and shall remain free.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.480
Free to be on social media for four hours.

25:25.940 --> 25:29.280
Free to get wasted and fuck around.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.860
Free to use 900.000 for a Russ bus.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.920
Norway isn't the same country as it
was when the Constitution was written.

25:38.660 --> 25:42.060
Norwegian society is constantly developing.

25:42.380 --> 25:48.240
Today, thousands of refugees are
coming into Europe in search of a place to live.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.660
Those are people from a different culture than us.

25:52.120 --> 25:56.700
People whose values we may disagree with.

25:57.080 --> 26:01.520
Some are afraid they
will threaten our Norwegian values.

26:02.440 --> 26:07.120
It would have been best
to have the Facebook function to just block them.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.340
But that's not how it goes.

26:09.660 --> 26:14.060
So, on this day when we celebrate our Constitution...

26:14.060 --> 26:16.060
... we shall remember what we celebrate.

26:16.760 --> 26:20.340
If we believe in the values it is based on...

26:20.560 --> 26:27.120
If we agree with the idea that all people
should be free and have equal rights...

26:27.500 --> 26:34.360
... it is our responsibility to
fight to preserve the values for all people.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.080
It is not there to open doors to
strangers who want to threaten our values...

26:40.540 --> 26:44.260
But it's not to open the doors for them.

26:45.700 --> 26:49.520
We live in a society because we need each other.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.740
People need people.

26:53.620 --> 26:59.860
It can be tiring to deal with others...
Especially the ones you disagree with.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.800
Those who think differently from you.

27:03.040 --> 27:10.540
Whether some are from another culture, or a girl who's
a lame Facebook friend from elementary school.

27:11.080 --> 27:17.980
In a peaceful society with equal rights, we have
to manage to listen to, and try to understand each other.

27:18.740 --> 27:27.300
Perhaps it's easier to understand if we focus on what
we have in common, rather than the differences.

27:27.880 --> 27:32.680
Look for what we agree with,
instead of what we disagree with.

27:33.180 --> 27:39.780
Maybe if we see the worst in others,
it is exactly what they will show us.

27:42.060 --> 27:47.640
We have the right to waste
four hours on social media every day.

27:48.020 --> 27:52.540
Because people before us have
fought for the freedom to do so.

27:53.020 --> 27:56.720
Soon it is us who will take over this country.

27:56.920 --> 28:01.300
It's up to us to determine which
values we live by in the future.

28:01.880 --> 28:09.760
I hope equal rights and freedom for all the people
of this world is a battle we are ready to take on.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.340
Completely seriously...

28:13.300 --> 28:19.560
If not we, who are raised in the
world's most free and richest country...

28:19.820 --> 28:24.960
If not we choose generosity,
patience, and openness...

28:25.680 --> 28:30.440
If not we choose to look for and
believe in the good in each other...

28:30.680 --> 28:34.540
If not we can fight for righteousness...

28:36.560 --> 28:39.740
Then who would be able to do it?

29:02.340 --> 29:03.700
What's wrong?

29:19.240 --> 29:22.240
I think I was raped by William's brother.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.580
Huh?

29:34.760 --> 29:39.600
I don't know... it's possible that
I had sex with him willingly, but...

29:42.060 --> 29:43.720
I don't remember anything.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.200
Did you ask him?

29:56.740 --> 29:58.060
What does he say?

30:18.580 --> 30:20.640
Fucking hell, that asshole!

30:20.720 --> 30:24.020
I swear to God,
if he raped you.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.380
We have to report him.

30:30.940 --> 30:33.900
What is there to report?

30:35.700 --> 30:39.180
I can't report anything
I know nothing about.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.680
I don't know what happened.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.840
Does it feel as if
you've had sex with him?

30:51.040 --> 30:52.460
How would I feel that?

30:53.980 --> 30:56.240
You're a virgin.
You would have noticed it.

31:09.580 --> 31:11.160
I'm not a virgin.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.820
I had sex when I was thirteen.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.020
Thirteen?!

31:33.860 --> 31:37.280
I had a boyfriend who was fifteen.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.940
So, I thought I was ready for it.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.640
Then he dumped me days later.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.660
End of story.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.220
What happened with William's brother?

32:00.240 --> 32:02.900
Tell us everything from the start.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.480
I had to talk to William.

32:19.960 --> 32:23.920
Eva and Chris... you don't know this.

32:25.820 --> 32:28.660
Everyone knows about you and William, Noora.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.020
I went to see William,
but he wasn't home.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.020
His brother was there.

32:50.440 --> 32:54.760
I went inside to charge my phone.

32:56.380 --> 32:59.780
I ended up talking to him.

33:03.420 --> 33:07.500
He just told me lots of shit about William.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.800
I felt really sad.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.280
I drank a glass of wine.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.280
Then I remember nothing.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.200
You were drugged?

33:34.980 --> 33:45.600
I don't know. I never drink alcohol, because I can't
take it. I either feel really bad or I black out.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.820
But, after one glass of wine?

34:01.120 --> 34:03.440
I think I drank a shot, too.

34:07.740 --> 34:14.160
But is there no one else you can ask?
Someone at the party, some witnesses?

34:21.120 --> 34:26.580
Yeah there was a
girl who goes to our school. Mari.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.900
Do you know who she is?

34:29.500 --> 34:30.720
What year?

34:32.480 --> 34:34.020
I don't know, but...

34:36.320 --> 34:38.880
I can't ask her, because...

34:40.380 --> 34:43.700
She seems like a bit of a bitch.

34:44.720 --> 34:45.800
How so?

34:47.500 --> 34:49.360
We have to go to the emergency room.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.160
Huh, no.

34:55.720 --> 34:59.720
They can help us. You
should've gone there long ago.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.720
It's the first place you go!

35:02.020 --> 35:05.080
They can help us find evidence
we can use against him.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.000
Everyone knows that.

35:07.400 --> 35:15.280
You go to the doctor. It's the first place you go. Before
showering, before changing your clothes, you just go to the doctor.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.100
I don't understand
how you didn't know that.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.960
I don't even know if I was raped.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.180
There's no evidence left now.

35:34.020 --> 35:46.580
And there's nothing the doctor,
the police, or the law can do now.

35:51.040 --> 35:59.720
In this free, democratic country we have to believe there are
laws and rules that protect us against assholes like him.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.920
We must believe in justice.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.300
We must believe that the good wins.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.580
Dead serious.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.100
If we don't believe in it...

36:15.260 --> 36:16.740
Who will believe in it then?

38:40.960 --> 38:41.980
Hello!

38:44.260 --> 38:45.160
Hi.

38:46.100 --> 38:47.700
Can we have two beers?

38:49.920 --> 38:51.660
I'm under 18.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.040
So nice to see you!

38:57.580 --> 38:59.420
Thought you were chickening out.

38:59.860 --> 39:03.840
It seemed like you
were a little paranoid in that chat.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.580
I remember very little of that night.

39:11.540 --> 39:15.280
So I'm nervous about what happened.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.500
You blacked out completely.

39:22.900 --> 39:24.140
Yes.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.020
What did I actually drink?

39:35.220 --> 39:37.680
Relax, it was just white wine.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.580
Or tequila? Didn't we drink tequila?

39:44.480 --> 39:45.600
Cheers.

39:50.140 --> 39:55.620
I'm not here to drink beer with you.
I just want to know what happened.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.920
You can have one beer with me, though.

40:02.940 --> 40:09.080
If you never intended to tell me what happened,
I'm just gonna go.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.820
Isn't that a little presumptuous?

40:18.440 --> 40:23.000
It's pretty ballsy to be rude to
someone who has naked pictures of you.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.320
Was that a threat?

40:31.300 --> 40:32.660
Did it sound like a threat?

40:33.880 --> 40:37.900
Yes.
-Yeah well, then it was a threat.

40:46.780 --> 40:49.940
What are you studying in Stockholm?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.080
Eh, international finance.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.960
You should have chosen law.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.180
Okay?

41:10.680 --> 41:14.140
Yeah then perhaps you wouldn't
have been in the situation you are in now.

41:22.120 --> 41:25.480
And what situation am I in now, Noora?

41:26.800 --> 41:32.040
You're in a situation where you'll
be convicted for child pornography.

41:37.460 --> 41:42.300
According to the penal code, paragraph 204a..

41:43.260 --> 41:51.940
.. the penalty for producing and possessing an image that sexualises
a child, is imprisonment for up to three years.

41:56.660 --> 42:02.020
I am under 18, and therefore according
to the Norwegian law, I am still a child.

42:07.420 --> 42:12.760
So those naked pictures you have of me,
that you took without my consent..

42:14.460 --> 42:20.300
Not only is it illegal that you took them,
but also that you stored them in your phone.

42:21.680 --> 42:26.440
So if I were you, I'd be really
careful about spreading them around.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.520
Before it enters another paragraph.

42:41.860 --> 42:43.300
Are you serious now?

42:47.100 --> 42:48.700
Does it look like I'm kidding?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.460
Child pornography?

42:53.940 --> 42:56.040
That's completely foolish.

42:58.140 --> 42:59.460
Tell that to the judge.

43:05.540 --> 43:09.760
You've also threatened me just now.

43:12.320 --> 43:15.200
According to the law about threats...

43:16.580 --> 43:21.300
Paragraph 263, and coercion paragraph 251...

43:22.040 --> 43:24.200
... it's punishable by imprisonment
of up to two years.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.040
Then we're up to five years.

43:29.420 --> 43:31.180
But relax..

43:32.180 --> 43:39.040
They tend to merge verdicts. So we're
talking about maybe two years in reality.

43:40.620 --> 43:43.740
But if you have a good lawyer,
which surely you have...

43:46.980 --> 43:51.300
Then we come to the violations of
the Alcohol Act, paragraph 1 to 5.

43:52.200 --> 43:55.940
Serving alcohol to minors,
on top of it all.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.460
That's something to have on your CV, right?

44:13.780 --> 44:16.520
However, I think the child pornography...

44:19.420 --> 44:21.040
That one has to be the worst.

44:26.540 --> 44:30.240
You know what happens to people in
prison who were convicted of child pornography?

44:37.640 --> 44:40.720
I wouldn't pick up the soap
in the shower if I were you.

44:41.820 --> 44:43.380
To put it like that.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.500
She's your last hope.

45:09.260 --> 45:11.680
Why didn't you talk to her before?

45:13.480 --> 45:15.500
Move on, or talk to her.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.960
What's the worst thing that could happen?

45:20.720 --> 45:24.160
That she says I had sex with her, as well.

45:25.280 --> 45:29.740
It's nothing to be embarrassed
about. I made out with Eva.

45:29.920 --> 45:33.420
The feelings that arise don't
necessarily mean you're a lesbian.

45:40.100 --> 45:43.260
It's a message from Nico.
-What does it say?

45:43.780 --> 45:45.060
Open it.

45:47.900 --> 45:58.580
<i>[Nice to see you yesterday. I hope you and
William become happy together.]</i>

45:58.660 --> 46:00.020
He told William.

46:11.740 --> 46:13.900
Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

46:28.300 --> 46:30.620
I'll explain everything.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.640
You didn't sleep with him?

46:40.880 --> 46:42.320
I don't know.
