Hi. I'm Dylan Minnette,
and I play Clay Jensen.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.667
I'm Katherine Langford,
and I play Hannah Baker.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.910
I'm Justin Prentice. I play Bryce Walker.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.422
I'm Alisha Boe. I play Jessica Davis.

00:15.590 --> 00:18.002
13 Reasons Why is a fictional series

00:18.100 --> 00:20.466
that tackles tough, real-world issues,

00:20.560 --> 00:22.767
taking a look at sexual assault,

00:22.930 --> 00:25.649
substance abuse, suicide, and more.

00:25.730 --> 00:27.891
By shedding a light
on these difficult topics,

00:27.980 --> 00:30.642
we hope our show can help viewers
start a conversation.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.528
But if you are struggling
with these issues yourself,

00:33.780 --> 00:35.441
this series may not be right for you,

00:35.610 --> 00:37.771
or you may want to watch it
with a trusted adult.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.111
And if you ever feel you need someone
to talk with,

00:40.200 --> 00:41.827
reach out to a parent, a friend,

00:41.910 --> 00:44.367
a school counselor, or an adult you trust,

00:44.460 --> 00:47.532
call a local helpline,
or go to 13ReasonsWhy.info.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.916
Because the minute you start
talking about it,

00:50.750 --> 00:51.751
it gets easier.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.302
[theme music playing]

01:20.200 --> 01:22.191
[man]
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.941
Calling the case
of Andrew and Olivia Baker

01:25.040 --> 01:27.531
versus the Evergreen County
School District.

01:28.370 --> 01:30.281
Are both sides ready to begin?

01:35.050 --> 01:36.460
She was so beautiful.

01:38.300 --> 01:41.133
And she was so nice to me.

01:41.890 --> 01:46.179
[Dennis] Tyler, you testified that life
at Liberty High School was bad

01:46.270 --> 01:48.010
before Hannah Baker killed herself.

01:48.100 --> 01:48.976
How is it now?

01:52.020 --> 01:52.850
Tyler?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.388
[Tyler] It's worse.

01:56.490 --> 01:58.196
["Love Vigilantes" playing]

02:06.910 --> 02:07.899
[man] Hey! Watch it!

02:10.040 --> 02:11.246
-[man 2] Whoa!
-[woman] Hey!

02:11.330 --> 02:14.163
[Tyler] It's been five months
since Hannah Baker killed herself.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.791
We never thought this trial would happen.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.336
We thought we could move on.

02:20.970 --> 02:25.464
But when I got called to testify,
it made me realize we can't just move on.

02:26.180 --> 02:32.767
Oh, I've just come
From the land of the sun

02:32.860 --> 02:33.975
Life is different now.

02:34.070 --> 02:38.939
From a war that must be won
In the name of truth

02:39.820 --> 02:43.699
With our soldiers so brave

02:43.780 --> 02:47.113
What did we say about red lights?
You promised me.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.747
I promise you a lot of things.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.364
You got your ID?

02:55.460 --> 02:57.291
"Cody Jantzen" from Texas.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.909
And are you ready for this?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.290
I am. I'm ready.

03:02.890 --> 03:05.848
It's like you said, it'll help me
put that part of my life to rest.

03:05.930 --> 03:08.216
-It shows I found closure--
-Yeah. Totally.

03:08.310 --> 03:11.438
But I meant, are you ready for the needle?

03:12.900 --> 03:15.858
-[needle buzzing]
-Breathe deep. Stay calm.

03:17.820 --> 03:19.026
I'm good, I'm fine.

03:20.190 --> 03:21.600
It's his first time.

03:23.030 --> 03:23.860
Really?

03:25.280 --> 03:28.693
So, the semi-colon,
it's for a friend of yours?

03:30.250 --> 03:31.069
Yeah. Yeah.

03:32.120 --> 03:32.950
I'm sorry.

03:34.670 --> 03:35.489
Thanks.

03:38.420 --> 03:39.250
Half done.

03:43.180 --> 03:43.999
Wow.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.926
Sweet. All right, cool.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.089
Yeah, keep going.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.346
[buzzing]

03:54.440 --> 03:56.897
[Tyler] The truth is,
everyone's still hurting.

03:58.690 --> 04:00.180
Some more than others.

04:02.530 --> 04:03.940
[thuds]

04:04.030 --> 04:05.361
Oh, shit.

04:07.490 --> 04:08.946
[Clay] It's a fucking comma.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.691
[chuckles] So it signifies a pause.

04:12.830 --> 04:15.958
As in, you paused getting a tattoo
in order to faint.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.542
Even just getting the tattoo,
I fucking fail.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.080
Hey.

04:24.550 --> 04:26.006
Hannah will forgive you.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.806
Look, I'm not--
I'm not thinking about her.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.300
-It's okay if you are.
-I'm not.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.226
I haven't for months now.

04:36.940 --> 04:37.895
Okay.

04:37.980 --> 04:41.609
And there's not gonna be a trial,
her folks are gonna settle,

04:41.690 --> 04:45.524
Bryce'll get away with it,
and you know, fuck it all.

04:45.950 --> 04:46.848
Fuck the world.

04:49.830 --> 04:50.899
All I care about is you.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.161
[Tyler] Maybe we try to convince ourselves
we're over it.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.211
Maybe it works for a while.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.926
Sure you're ready for this?

05:07.760 --> 05:10.752
Are you sure you are? I've done it before.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.346
Yeah, I'm ready, I mean...

05:13.310 --> 05:16.848
I have been, and I am today. Ready.

05:17.190 --> 05:18.509
-Okay.
-Yeah.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.697
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.491
-What is that?
-It's nothing.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.041
-Keep going.
-Wait, those are cuts.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.006
-You cut down there?
-I used to, a long time ago.

05:48.090 --> 05:49.296
But those are recent.

05:51.140 --> 05:54.962
You're supposed to call me
if you even just think about it.

05:55.060 --> 05:57.130
Where are your rubber bands?
Have you been trying meditation?

05:57.390 --> 06:00.143
Meditation is the most fucking
boring thing in the world.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.010
Then we're going to take
a mindfulness walk.

06:03.110 --> 06:04.350
[chuckles]

06:04.440 --> 06:05.987
I'm fucking serious, Slqe.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.737
I will do whatever I have to do.
I will text you every hour.

06:09.820 --> 06:12.698
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

06:14.740 --> 06:15.786
I promise I'll call.

06:17.870 --> 06:18.700
Okay.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.046
[Tyler] I tried not thinking about it.

06:24.590 --> 06:27.878
Some days I was able to shut it all out
and live my life.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.005
Some days I wasn't.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.939
But then I got home last night
and got news I wasn't expecting.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.140
-[Lainie] How's Slqe?
-She's good.

06:50.030 --> 06:51.315
You should invite her in.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.117
We haven't seen her since,
what, the seventh grade?

06:54.530 --> 06:58.114
-She hasn't really changed.
-We'll have her over for dinner.

06:59.370 --> 07:03.534
-Um, Skye doesn't really do dinner.
-She doesn't eat?

07:04.170 --> 07:07.662
I mean, no, she eats,
just not in situations with parents.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.627
Clay, I need to talk to you
about the trial.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.294
What? What trial?

07:15.680 --> 07:18.558
Hannah's trial. It's moving forward.

07:18.890 --> 07:19.800
[stammers] What?

07:21.690 --> 07:24.432
-You told me it was settled.
-We thought it was.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.973
But the Bakers rejected
the district's final offer today.

07:28.730 --> 07:29.685
It starts tomorrow.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.903
Tomorrow? How is that possible?

07:37.080 --> 07:38.866
They were up against the trial date.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.248
At the last minute,
the Bakers rejected the settlement.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.990
So, I'll get to testify about Bryce?

07:46.540 --> 07:50.089
Sonya did tell me
that you're not on either witness list.

07:51.550 --> 07:52.369
Why not?

07:52.470 --> 07:55.792
Clay, each side chooses witnesses
based on a variety of factors.

07:56.050 --> 07:57.347
Bryce raped Hannah.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.592
Why is nobody talking about that?
You heard his confession.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.682
You heard everything,
before you dropped out.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.225
I didn't drop out of the case.

08:04.310 --> 08:07.939
I withdrew because your involvement
created a conflict of interest.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.523
Well, I'm not involved anymore,
so can someone do something?

08:10.820 --> 08:12.356
If we knew the girl on tape nine.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.350
Mom, it's not my place to tell you that.

08:14.450 --> 08:19.035
-If she would come forward--
-This is a fucking joke. He confessed!

08:19.120 --> 08:21.031
Clay, I'm worried about your anger.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.492
You're worried about my anger?
That's what you're worried about?

08:29.920 --> 08:31.581
I'm not angry, Mom. I'm fine.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.217
That's why you're never home?

08:35.550 --> 08:36.380
We had a deal.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.967
I've had perfect attendance, kept up
my grades, I get to have a life of my own.

08:41.060 --> 08:45.053
The deal was that you would be safe.
You put a lock on your door.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.267
Which you found out by trying to open it?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.142
Clay, I know this is going to be
very hard for you.

08:52.780 --> 08:53.599
It's not.

08:55.110 --> 08:58.864
I haven't thought about Hannah in months.
So I'll just keep on like that.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.146
[Tyler] This trial going forward,

09:35.990 --> 09:37.400
it affects the whole town.

09:38.070 --> 09:39.867
We have to think about it all over again,

09:39.950 --> 09:41.941
how Hannah lived and how she died.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.321
And how it changed all our lives.

10:01.850 --> 10:04.557
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Dad.

10:04.640 --> 10:09.145
So, your mom isn't too happy
about you going back to school tomorrow.

10:09.230 --> 10:11.141
Well, I have to go back with Jessica.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.938
We promised we'd go back together,
and she's going back tomorrow.

10:15.030 --> 10:17.942
Okay, but we were thinking
more like a week, maybe two?

10:18.150 --> 10:19.606
Dad, it has to be now.

10:19.860 --> 10:22.158
-[clears throat] 'Cause of the trial?
-Yeah.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.789
And I know people have been
talking about me for months now.

10:25.870 --> 10:27.952
-Who's been talking?
-It's a small town, Dad.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.281
I can't even go outside
without people looking at me.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.121
Or talking about what I did.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.748
Or what Hannah did and I failed to do.
And I'm sick of hiding from them all.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.718
You're not hiding from anyone.
You're recuperating.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.291
I can still do that. Just out there.

10:44.140 --> 10:47.177
And Hannah's trial means
people are finally gonna hear her story,

10:47.270 --> 10:48.669
and I want to help tell it.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.397
Okay. Well, you keep pushing ahead.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.147
I'll tell the boss lady
you're feeling stronger.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.020
Good work today, by the way.

10:59.610 --> 11:01.191
You think I'll get to testify?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.987
I don't know. I think that's up
to your doctors and the court.

11:06.790 --> 11:07.905
Okay? Get some sleep.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.029
I love you.

11:15.340 --> 11:16.295
[door shuts]

11:18.050 --> 11:20.041
[buzzes]

11:22.590 --> 11:24.046
Hey, what'd they say?

11:25.140 --> 11:29.474
- I can go. How about you?
-They don't like it, but they said yes.

11:29.810 --> 11:31.380
This trial has me freaked out.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.512
What have people been saying about us?
What do they know?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.600
We're gonna find out.

11:39.940 --> 11:40.770
Jess".

11:40.990 --> 11:43.481
Look, whatever happens,
we're gonna stick to the plan.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.117
I don't remember what happened to me,

11:45.200 --> 11:47.191
just like you don't remember
what happened to you.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.241
-Right?
-Right.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.201
You feel okay about seeing Bryce again?

11:57.170 --> 11:59.081
-Yeah. Totally.
-[gunshot echoes]

12:15.230 --> 12:16.140
[Tyler] You hurt.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.603
Worse, you feel... powerless.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.418
I know some people don't want us
to talk about what happened...

12:41.090 --> 12:43.797
but if we don't talk about it,
it's never going to change.

12:48.890 --> 12:51.768
So it's important for everyone
to understand how it all happened.

12:52.850 --> 12:54.431
The whole story, you know?

13:11.450 --> 13:13.998
Because things at Liberty
are as bad as they've ever been.

13:14.330 --> 13:15.649
Mom, it's gonna be fine.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.748
No, I don't mind being the first kid
to testify. I want to be the first.

13:23.340 --> 13:25.752
Yeah. I told the lawyers that. I know.

13:27.050 --> 13:27.880
Yeah, I know.

13:30.890 --> 13:33.711
[sighs] All right, look,
I'll be home soon. Okay? Bye.

13:35.390 --> 13:37.130
And I don't want to be afraid anymore.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.617
I don't want to be afraid.

13:52.950 --> 13:55.191
[Mrs. Down] I don't know why this case
is going forward.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.155
I don't why you need to be the first.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.707
-The way these kids abuse you--
-That's why I have to be first.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.548
They want me to talk
about how things are at school,

14:05.710 --> 14:07.166
and somebody has to do that.

14:07.260 --> 14:10.081
It's very brave of you, Tyler,
to want to do this for Hannah.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.171
It's not just for Hannah, okay?

14:12.260 --> 14:15.718
It's for me, and Alex, and...

14:18.690 --> 14:19.896
and I have to.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.813
Okay, your dad's on a double and they have
extra units outside the courthouse.

14:24.900 --> 14:28.609
If you need anything, call me, okay?
I can get coverage if I have to.

14:31.950 --> 14:33.690
Mom, did I leave a note?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.321
Yes. You left a note.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.160
I want to see it.

14:41.250 --> 14:44.378
Alex, honey, I--
I don't know that you're ready to--

14:44.460 --> 14:46.792
What? To know the truth?
Or know why I did it?

14:49.260 --> 14:51.296
Is this that you don't want me
to think about it

14:51.390 --> 14:53.597
or you just don't want to talk about it?

14:55.680 --> 14:58.171
It's my goddamn note, Mom,
I want to see it!

14:58.850 --> 15:01.808
-What, did you throw it away?
-Of course we didn't throw it away.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.109
Okay. How about I give it to you
the next time you see Dr. Ellman?

15:07.400 --> 15:12.690
God. Mom, I promise you,
I'll talk to him about it. Please.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.756
Do you want to talk about it?

15:40.520 --> 15:42.727
[inhales] Um...

15:45.020 --> 15:46.100
What does this mean?

15:46.520 --> 15:48.932
"I could have stopped it."
What does that mean?

15:49.610 --> 15:51.191
How could I have stopped it?

15:51.650 --> 15:54.312
It just means
that you felt terrible guilt.

15:54.870 --> 15:59.569
That you felt responsible, but that
is too much for any one person to take on.

15:59.660 --> 16:01.150
You know that now, right?

16:04.080 --> 16:05.411
"I could have stopped it."

16:08.670 --> 16:09.659
[woman] Good morning.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.046
[sighs] Are you ready for battle?

16:14.180 --> 16:17.138
Is anyone ever really ready
for something like this?

16:17.220 --> 16:19.677
You are. We are.

16:23.850 --> 16:28.685
Thank you, Jackie, for being here.
Truly, it's above and beyond.

16:28.770 --> 16:29.816
This is what I do.

16:30.940 --> 16:34.319
I'll be the only one in that room
who truly knows what you're going through.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.822
Remember that. I will be your strength.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.287
I'm not afraid. I'm not.

16:41.370 --> 16:46.125
I mean, for so long, I've... [sighs]
I've dreaded this day, but now I'm just...

16:47.630 --> 16:48.949
-I'm angry.
-Mm-hm.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.838
-I'm angry. At everyone.
-Good.

16:53.130 --> 16:54.119
Hold on to that.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.632
And your husband,
were you able to convince him to--?

16:58.890 --> 16:59.709
No.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.301
[Tyler] Part of me didn't want
to come to court today.

17:09.230 --> 17:10.470
But I knew I had to be here.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.144
For Hannah.

17:14.030 --> 17:14.849
For her mom.

17:18.450 --> 17:19.610
For everyone who gets bullied

17:19.700 --> 17:22.032
while Liberty still lets them
get away with it.

17:22.540 --> 17:26.613
Guys like Scott Reed,
Montgomery De La Cruz, Bryce Walker.

17:27.330 --> 17:30.037
-[Montgomery] Thought it was gonna settle.
-Don't worry about it.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.918
-What, is that Cory Jensen gonna testify?
-Clay.

17:37.050 --> 17:38.381
Don't know, don't care.

17:41.220 --> 17:43.597
[grunts] Yeah, all that Hannah Baker shit

17:43.680 --> 17:45.227
will get dredged up all over again.

17:46.060 --> 17:47.436
My dad's got the trial covered.

17:49.350 --> 17:50.351
We'll figure it out.

17:51.110 --> 17:53.601
Now fucking Jessica Davis
is coming back to Liberty?

17:53.690 --> 17:57.069
-Is that a coincidence or what?
-Aga|n, man. Don't know, don't care.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.771
Don't worry about the fucking trial, man.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.407
[Olivia] I want them to hear
Hannah's voice.

18:07.660 --> 18:10.493
-We've talked about this.
-But, Dennis, I want them to hear

18:10.580 --> 18:12.582
-the pain she was in.
-Olivia,

18:12.670 --> 18:16.049
we'd have to argue best evidence
just to get the tapes admitted.

18:16.130 --> 18:19.338
-But Tony gave us the cassettes.
-Yes, and if one goes in, they all go in.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.091
We can't get Porter
without getting Hannah drunk.

18:22.390 --> 18:24.961
Hannah taking her shirt off,
leaving the scene of a crime.

18:25.060 --> 18:28.769
-All right, what about Bryce Walker?
-Again, we start with the school first.

18:28.850 --> 18:31.899
It doesn't help to bring him
and his father's legal team into it.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.936
He raped her. The school knew about it.

18:34.020 --> 18:37.069
And unless there's corroboration,
it's his word against hers.

18:37.190 --> 18:40.819
We have to establish a pattern of activity
that the school was aware of.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.531
We're starting with Tyler Down...?

18:46.160 --> 18:48.822
Because he can speak to the climate
of bullying at Liberty.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.998
And because we had yesterday
to get subpoenas out.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.581
I know. I'm sorry, Dennis.

18:53.670 --> 18:57.254
Just, when they put the NDA
back on the table, I couldn't stay silent.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.389
Hannah's story needs to be told.

19:03.390 --> 19:04.709
And we're gonna tell it.

19:06.180 --> 19:09.172
[Dennis] Each day in this trial,
you're gonna hear testimony

19:09.270 --> 19:11.556
from students who knew Hannah Baker
at Liberty High,

19:12.020 --> 19:15.808
from adults at Liberty,
from Hannah's own parents.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.648
You'll hear about a girl in crisis,
a poisonous school culture,

19:20.740 --> 19:22.480
and an administration

19:22.570 --> 19:25.983
that could have averted a tragedy,
but didn't.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.033
You'll hear about a beautiful,
innocent, sensitive girl

19:31.120 --> 19:32.496
who was bullied to death.

19:32.580 --> 19:37.290
And for every story you hear
about a precious girl that we've lost,

19:38.800 --> 19:40.256
there are stories of the living.

19:42.180 --> 19:45.672
There are lives in the balance.
Justice must be done.

19:46.470 --> 19:49.598
For Hannah,
and for those who are still suffering.

19:51.350 --> 19:53.398
[Sonya] There's more than one side
to every story.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.899
The plaintiffs will tell you
what they believe to be Hannah's story,

19:57.150 --> 19:59.277
but nothing is as simple as it seems.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.732
No one is just a victim.

20:02.700 --> 20:07.820
Her parents want to blame the school,
but there's plenty of blame to go around.

20:08.700 --> 20:12.454
You'll hear the full story.
And you'll make up your own mind.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.201
[indistinct chattering]

20:17.540 --> 20:20.373
-[Jessica] See you later. Bye.
-[man] Okay. Bye-bye.

20:22.550 --> 20:23.369
Hey.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.672
-You look beautiful today.
-So do you.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.593
-I look damaged.
-It's a good look on you.

20:32.270 --> 20:35.979
-See, everybody's checking you out.
-They're checking you out.

20:36.650 --> 20:38.971
You're pretty and sad. People love that.

20:39.070 --> 20:42.278
You have a cane and a scar.
All my scars are msrde.

20:42.360 --> 20:46.319
[scoffs] We're definitely going to hell
for joking about this.

20:46.410 --> 20:50.619
Alex, my friend, we're in hell already.
I plan to look like I'm enjoying it.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.694
[Alex sighs]

20:57.540 --> 20:59.030
They're looking at you more.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.836
-They're looking at you more.
-[scoffs]

21:02.130 --> 21:03.836
Which one of us is more tragic?

21:04.510 --> 21:06.671
Ryan should do another one
of his stupid polls.

21:07.390 --> 21:10.757
-I'll take that.
-I can carry my own books.

21:10.850 --> 21:13.922
Well, clearly you can't,
so let me help, don't be a dick.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.556
-And welcome back.
-[Jessica] Thank you.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.607
I meant to ask you guys about my note.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.892
-What_ note?
-My surmde note.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.778
-Jesus, put that away.
-It's not radioactive.

21:24.860 --> 21:29.695
No, I know, it's just...
we're not allowed to talk about suicide.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.787
Or you. Or Hannah.

21:32.290 --> 21:35.157
-Says who?
-Says the school.

21:35.580 --> 21:37.536
They made a rule the day after you...

21:39.380 --> 21:40.278
after that day.

21:40.380 --> 21:44.009
And if you talk about it on campus,
you get suspended.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.677
-That's so fucked up.
-Yeah.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.001
-Oh, shit.
-[Ty|er] They find you in the hallway...

21:50.100 --> 21:52.341
[Zach] Let's go. Who do you have
first period? Mr. Wood?

21:52.430 --> 21:54.591
Yeah. I can't turn that fast.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.636
-What are you running from, Zach?
-Nothing.

21:56.730 --> 22:00.439
Hey! Jess, Alex, welcome back, you guys.

22:00.690 --> 22:05.434
-'Sup, Alex? Jess.
-Seriously? "Welcome back"?

22:05.990 --> 22:09.448
Alex, stop. I'll see you guys after third.

22:09.780 --> 22:12.522
I'm gonna take the long way.
It's gonna be a good day.

22:13.910 --> 22:17.118
-[laughter]
-[Scott] I told you not to do that, man.

22:17.910 --> 22:19.787
[Tyler] They act like they own the school.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.246
[laughter echoes]

22:29.010 --> 22:30.580
Hey, man. You okay?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.295
[Tyler] They get in your head...

22:32.890 --> 22:33.709
I'm fine.

22:35.430 --> 22:38.843
People tell lies about you,
and other people believe them.

22:43.610 --> 22:45.316
And it gets to the point where...

22:46.690 --> 22:48.738
the lies might as well be the truth.

22:49.030 --> 22:51.351
[Dennis] And did people tell lies
about Hannah Baker?

22:52.660 --> 22:55.618
Yes, they did. All the time.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.286
[Tyler] And another girl I know,

23:04.040 --> 23:05.792
she had something happen to her.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.381
She had to leave school for a while.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.962
While she was gone,
the story got totally twisted.

23:24.610 --> 23:27.977
They know Justin accused Bryce
of raping her.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.944
_ But after Justin_left
and Jessma stopped coming to school,

23:32.030 --> 23:33.816
Bryce just spun the whole story.

23:34.660 --> 23:37.572
He said they that hooked up
and that she, like, wanted it.

23:37.830 --> 23:41.209
What?
Then why would Justin say all that shit?

23:41.290 --> 23:44.327
Bryce said Jessica felt bad
for cheating on Justin with him.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.836
Such a fucking asshole.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.252
With you guys coming back,
maybe it's best that we...

23:50.050 --> 23:51.836
just don't poke the bear, you know?

23:52.180 --> 23:56.219
-Let's try to get things back to normal.
-I don't think there is a normal anymore.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.299
[phone buzzes]

24:13.610 --> 24:16.408
[man] Be seated, please. Two minutes.

24:17.030 --> 24:20.329
[Sonya] Tyler, in your deposition,
you said you took pictures of Hannah.

24:20.410 --> 24:21.445
Yes, I did.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.912
And it upset her
and I felt terrible about it.

24:25.250 --> 24:29.129
But isn't it true that Hannah actually
enjoyed having you take her picture?

24:31.380 --> 24:34.543
-What?
-Defense exhibit B.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.249
Tyler...

24:38.560 --> 24:40.881
did you take these pictures?

24:45.060 --> 24:45.890
Um...

24:47.900 --> 24:48.719
yes.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.220
[stammers] Yeah, I did. I did.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.359
And was this before or after
Hannah was allegedly bullied?

24:57.410 --> 24:58.479
I guess, before.

24:59.330 --> 25:02.402
-And how did you come to take them?
-I, um...

25:03.460 --> 25:04.449
[sighs]

25:08.000 --> 25:09.376
It was the first day of school.

25:10.960 --> 25:11.790
Sophomore year.

25:16.930 --> 25:18.841
[Tyler]
I was the Student Life photographer.

25:20.470 --> 25:24.930
I was trying to get candids, you know,
everyone still in their summer tan.

25:25.020 --> 25:28.183
Hey, guys. Hey, uh, yearbook?

25:28.650 --> 25:30.265
-Yeah, fuck it, whatever.
-Cool.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.647
[Tyler] Football team. Looking good, guys.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.946
[camera shutter clicks]

25:35.320 --> 25:38.448
-[laughs]
-What? They were special memories.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.980
-Thanks, guys.
-It's bad enough we gotta--

25:42.490 --> 25:43.320
Oh.

25:44.580 --> 25:47.322
-That's that new girl.
-Yeah, Hannah Baker.

25:47.920 --> 25:48.909
She's fucking hot.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.242
-Smile, girls.
-Gross. Tyler, go away.

25:53.090 --> 25:53.909
It's for yearbook.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.541
Hey. Shoot me.

26:01.350 --> 26:04.057
-What?
-Shoot me and the locker that won't open.

26:05.390 --> 26:08.188
-Yeah. Yeah, all right. Um...
-[camera shutter clicks]

26:09.900 --> 26:10.889
[Tyler chuckles]

26:12.400 --> 26:15.028
Uh, here, I can actually help with this.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.099
I'm Hannah.

26:17.900 --> 26:21.939
I saw you at Kat's party, actually,
which I think was at your house.

26:22.030 --> 26:25.989
-Yeah, it was.
-Sorry, this is just-- Cool.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.747
-Thank you.
-Yeah. No worries.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.293
-And your name is?
-Oh, um, Tyler. Tyler, yeah.

26:34.920 --> 26:39.334
Uh, would you ever want to, I don't know,
do a photo shoot or something?

26:41.220 --> 26:42.039
Sure.

26:42.850 --> 26:44.465
I told her to come camera-ready.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.972
[Olivia] Whoa. Isn't that a little much?

26:47.980 --> 26:52.189
-You want to have a light touch. Classy.
-It's for a photo shoot.

26:52.690 --> 26:56.729
Where, in a brothel?
Just take it down a notch. Okay?

26:56.820 --> 26:58.447
Don't want people getting the wrong idea.

27:03.070 --> 27:06.745
I could tell she had been crying.
I wasn't sure why.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.207
She didn't need the makeup aanay.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.581
She was so beautiful.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.543
And she was so nice to me.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.177
I'm sorry, I'm not camera-ready.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.216
Sure you are. It's good. You're good.

27:25.060 --> 27:25.879
Thanks.

27:26.890 --> 27:31.509
Look, the whole point is to capture you
as who you are, okay?

27:31.600 --> 27:32.680
Yeah. Okay. Cool.

27:33.770 --> 27:34.600
Yeah.

27:35.860 --> 27:37.100
So, should we...?

27:37.980 --> 27:39.607
[Tyler] I wondered who made her cry.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.449
Who made her feel like that
when she only ever deserved to be happy?

27:44.120 --> 27:46.736
-Yes. Okay, keep that up.
-[camera shutter clicks]

27:48.830 --> 27:49.649
[scoffs]

27:50.160 --> 27:53.744
Wow, you're... you're really amazing.

27:53.830 --> 27:55.878
-Thank you for doing this.
-Uh...

27:56.000 --> 27:58.298
-Thank you for asking.
-Of course.

27:59.590 --> 28:00.466
Perfect.

28:00.550 --> 28:03.383
[Tyler] But like I said,
the picture's only part of the story.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.843
[Sonya] From these, it seemed that Hannah
liked having her picture taken.

28:06.930 --> 28:08.557
Well, I mean, that day--

28:08.770 --> 28:11.887
You didn't tell us about that day.
What else are you not telling us?

28:11.980 --> 28:14.266
-[Dennis] Objection, argumentative.
-[Sonya] Withdrawn.

28:15.020 --> 28:18.649
Tyler, isn't it true that no real bullying
resulted from any of the photos you took?

28:18.730 --> 28:20.231
No, it's not true.

28:20.650 --> 28:22.527
I spread around a picture of Hannah.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.118
And then Clay Jensen did the same to me.

28:26.620 --> 28:29.737
But how could that be bullying
if Hannah liked the attention?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.709
I mean, she... she liked it then.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.951
But when Justin and those guys
sent that picture around...

28:39.590 --> 28:41.376
it told a story that wasn't true.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.541
-Oh, hey, Hannah. What's up?
-Hey, can I talk to you?

28:47.890 --> 28:50.176
[Tyler] I wanted to let her know
I'd been there too.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.057
I wanted to tell Hannah
I saw her for who she really was.

28:54.890 --> 28:55.720
Hey, Hannah.

28:57.190 --> 28:58.896
[sighs] What? What do you want?

29:00.280 --> 29:01.099
Um...

29:01.780 --> 29:05.739
Look, I just, I mean, I know
that there's this picture going around--

29:05.820 --> 29:07.401
Yeah, there is. Thank you.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.867
Look, I just wanted to say to you, um...

29:13.750 --> 29:15.490
you're the most beautiful girl at Liberty.

29:15.870 --> 29:17.701
If you want to do another photo shoot--

29:17.790 --> 29:21.169
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Get away from me.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.125
[Tyler] I knew I had said the wrong thing.

29:25.340 --> 29:26.716
I always say the wrong thing.

29:28.970 --> 29:31.131
I printed out all the best photos
from the shoot,

29:32.430 --> 29:34.136
so she could see how beautiful she was.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.347
Even if kids at school wanted to see her
as a slut or whatever.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.681
And I wanted to give them to her,
as like, a gift.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.811
[indistinct chattering]

29:47.360 --> 29:51.114
[Tyler] But she was with... a boy.

29:53.080 --> 29:57.779
And then I got shy, and I hid from them.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.030
[Clay] Have a good night.

30:33.370 --> 30:36.533
[Tyler] I took out my camera,
just so I could get a better look.

30:38.750 --> 30:39.569
And...

30:40.290 --> 30:43.032
-[phone camera shutter clicks]
-...I started to take pictures.

30:44.630 --> 30:47.542
Hoping the pictures would make sense
of what I was seeing.

30:47.630 --> 30:48.710
[camera shutter clicks]

30:51.140 --> 30:51.959
[Sonya] What did you see?

30:53.390 --> 30:56.018
Hannah was doing more
than chatting that night, wasn't she?

30:57.270 --> 31:02.185
-What did you see?
-She wasn't just texting, okay?

31:02.270 --> 31:04.761
She was sexting.

31:04.860 --> 31:07.988
And, like, showing herself off...

31:08.950 --> 31:10.269
to some guy.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.941
After everything she went through,
I just...

31:12.820 --> 31:15.152
didn't understand why she would do that,

31:15.240 --> 31:19.028
why she would share
that special part of herself

31:19.120 --> 31:22.123
with just... some guy.

31:22.210 --> 31:25.668
Someone who didn't care about her,
who didn't know how special she was.

31:27.130 --> 31:32.045
So isn't it true that Hannah
opened herself up for a reaction,

31:32.140 --> 31:35.803
and therefore, is in many ways responsible
for what followed?

31:37.810 --> 31:39.846
Isn't she actually responsible?

31:41.690 --> 31:42.679
What about you, Tyler?

31:43.690 --> 31:46.511
Are you in no way responsible
for the things that happen to you?

31:51.320 --> 31:52.810
Hey, Clay.

31:55.450 --> 31:59.034
-Hey, Zach.
-Were you at court this morning?

31:59.120 --> 32:01.862
Yeah.
I couldn't take Tyler's lies, so I left.

32:04.630 --> 32:07.702
So how is this gonna happen?
Is everything gonna come out?

32:08.210 --> 32:09.370
How the fuck would I know?

32:11.380 --> 32:12.836
Well, when do you testify?

32:14.930 --> 32:15.749
I don't.

32:16.010 --> 32:18.137
What?
Why would they call me and not call you?

32:18.930 --> 32:20.591
I don't know and I don't care.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.595
How can you not care?

32:24.350 --> 32:28.013
I care about my girlfriend and I care
about my grades, and that's plenty.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.653
When you're under oath,
they can ask you anything, right?

32:36.910 --> 32:37.979
You stole a fucking note.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.150
Not like you raped her.
What are you worried about?

32:40.580 --> 32:43.242
What about the tapes?
What about the tape you made?

32:43.330 --> 32:46.663
Why are you still hanging around
with Bryce? What does he have on you?

32:46.750 --> 32:52.666
I'm not hanging out with Bryce, okay?
I just-- I have to play baseball with him.

32:52.760 --> 32:56.389
And I was just hoping that this trial
wouldn't fuck up everybody's life.

32:58.430 --> 33:01.593
Well, too late.

33:02.390 --> 33:04.517
[Tyler]
I mean, it's not like it goes both ways.

33:07.270 --> 33:10.569
There are the people who get hurt,
and the people who do the hurting.

33:33.380 --> 33:34.290
Mr. Walker.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.586
I was wondering
ifI might have a word with you.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.882
Kind of in the middle of something,
Mr. Porter.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.422
[scoffs] I'll wait.
Your hair looks good. Get to class.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.299
[flushing]

33:49.770 --> 33:50.600
What's up?

33:52.070 --> 33:54.026
Jessica Davis is back today.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.231
Wanna let you know I got my eye on you.

33:57.570 --> 33:59.276
You and a dozen college scouts.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.486
I don't know
what that's got to do with Jessica.

34:04.450 --> 34:05.747
Listen, you little shit.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.576
I know everything
that I need to know about you.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.872
You go near the girl,
you look in her direction,

34:12.300 --> 34:13.619
and I will fuck up your life.

34:13.710 --> 34:15.917
[gags] I don't think
you can speak to me that way.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.710
I didn't.

34:19.010 --> 34:20.136
[gaSPSI

34:20.220 --> 34:22.552
-I was just checking in on you.
-[sputters]

34:23.890 --> 34:27.769
Thought you may be a little upset,
with the trial starting and everything.

34:28.810 --> 34:31.301
-You've got more to lose than I do.
-Do I?

34:34.980 --> 34:36.060
We'll find out.

34:39.990 --> 34:40.809
[slams door open]

34:41.490 --> 34:45.494
-The day so far, not great?
-[grunts]

34:45.910 --> 34:47.707
Why didn't you tell me they outlawed me?

34:49.620 --> 34:52.623
-What? That never happened.
-I mean, talking about me.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.996
Or talking about me trying to kill myself.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.257
-Shit. Did they?
-Yeah.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.679
[sighs] I kind of stopped listening
to morning announcements.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.803
And teachers. And people.

35:08.430 --> 35:09.806
You had a question for me?

35:10.350 --> 35:14.309
Yeah, um, so you know
that I left a suicide note?

35:15.320 --> 35:16.139
Um...

35:17.860 --> 35:20.818
-Yeah.
-Why didn't you tell me about it?

35:23.490 --> 35:24.616
Well, I-I didn't...

35:25.200 --> 35:28.158
I mean, I didn't think it
was the kind of thing that you talk about

35:28.330 --> 35:31.458
with someone who's like,
recovering from it.

35:37.090 --> 35:39.661
Look. What do you think that this meant?

35:39.760 --> 35:40.749
You have it here?

35:41.090 --> 35:43.547
Yeah, they can't suspend me
for talking about me.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.505
"I could have stopped it."

35:48.390 --> 35:51.882
What does that mean,
"I could have stopped it"? Stopped what?

35:53.940 --> 35:54.759
I...

35:57.110 --> 35:58.179
I don't know. I mean...

35:59.320 --> 36:01.527
You probably thought
you could've stopped Hannah.

36:02.780 --> 36:04.987
You felt guilty. We all did.

36:05.740 --> 36:07.025
I don't think that's it.

36:08.870 --> 36:10.155
There's something more.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.206
[sighs]

36:13.290 --> 36:15.747
[Tyler] No one likes the kind of attention
Hannah got.

36:17.380 --> 36:18.415
Or I got.

36:19.300 --> 36:22.463
Or that I'm gonna get
when I leave court today

36:22.550 --> 36:25.599
and have to go back to that school
where no one looks out for us.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.589
[bangs]

36:28.680 --> 36:30.762
-The hell?
-I never laid a hand on you.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.648
Never. I saw other guys fucking with you,
I told them to back off.

36:34.730 --> 36:36.550
So why are you talking about me in court?

36:37.360 --> 36:39.931
Jesus, how did you know that already?
Did Clay tell you?

36:40.030 --> 36:41.736
Never mind, just tell me why you talked.

36:41.820 --> 36:43.981
'Cause your little darkroom threat
didn't scare me.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.196
What "darkroom threat"?

36:46.280 --> 36:49.579
You can fuck with me all you want,
I don't care. You'll pay.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.280
Mr. Walker?

37:04.840 --> 37:08.674
Listen, if uh...
if Bryce hassles you again,

37:08.760 --> 37:09.806
you come and tell me.

37:11.970 --> 37:14.131
And I want you
in my new special skills class.

37:17.150 --> 37:18.640
-No, thank you.
-It's not optional.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.516
I spoke to your folks.
You can start tomorrow.

37:44.300 --> 37:47.042
[Tyler] I mean, Hannah took sexy pictures,

37:47.130 --> 37:48.927
but that doesn't make her guilty
of anything.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.090
One picture never tells the whole story.

38:25.420 --> 38:26.250
[Tony] Clay.

38:28.970 --> 38:29.789
Hey, Tony.

38:30.260 --> 38:33.138
What the hell, man?
You told me this case was gonna settle.

38:34.140 --> 38:38.179
-[scoffs] We thought it was.
-Well, they called me to testify.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.350
I-I wouldn't worry about it.

38:43.150 --> 38:44.936
The Bakers know you did what Hannah asked.

38:45.030 --> 38:48.193
The Bakers didn't call me.
The school did. Why?

38:50.160 --> 38:51.024
I don't know.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.656
My mom said each side calls

38:53.740 --> 38:56.322
whoever they think will help
tell their version of the story.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.247
How am I a part of the school's story?

39:01.210 --> 39:02.700
You didn't do anything wrong.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.167
You don't know everything I did, Clay.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.875
Hey, Tony.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.716
What, um...

39:14.260 --> 39:15.807
What do you know about Scott Reed?

39:16.270 --> 39:17.419
Uh, the baseball player?

39:18.680 --> 39:21.057
He plays baseball
and he's friends with Bryce.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.100
That's what I know. Why?

39:24.820 --> 39:26.105
Uh, probably nothing.

39:31.780 --> 39:32.610
[man] Okay.

39:32.780 --> 39:35.522
So, we live
in an "affirmative consent" state.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.747
That means you must have
an actual affirmative

39:37.830 --> 39:41.539
from your sexual partner
in order to engage in intercourse.

39:42.290 --> 39:45.623
Silence or lack of resistance
does not demonstrate consent.

39:45.920 --> 39:49.048
Consent must be given in words
or in actions.

39:49.130 --> 39:50.666
-Does a scream count?
-[all chuckling]

39:51.630 --> 39:53.791
[Mr. Porter]
You want to be a comedian, Mr. Reed?

39:54.550 --> 39:56.051
Or you wanna play ball this year?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.516
'Cause I can arrange
that you take the season off.

40:02.270 --> 40:03.259
I didn't think so.

40:06.070 --> 40:06.889
Right.

40:07.980 --> 40:09.481
So, affirmative consent.

40:22.330 --> 40:23.160
Hey.

40:25.170 --> 40:25.989
What?

40:26.540 --> 40:28.701
-It's good to see you, too.
-[scoffs]

40:28.920 --> 40:31.218
Oh, I'm sorry. "Hi, Ryan. How are things?

40:31.420 --> 40:32.876
Really? He is a bitch.

40:32.970 --> 40:34.790
You should dump him. You deserve better."

40:35.430 --> 40:36.340
That about cover it?

40:39.430 --> 40:41.887
They called me to testify
at Hannah's trial.

40:42.310 --> 40:43.129
Okay.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.766
Me too, but we're not
supposed to talk about it.

40:54.660 --> 40:55.479
Here.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.076
Everything she wrote about that day.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.536
All of it.

41:04.870 --> 41:06.167
I'm not gonna say anything...

41:07.210 --> 41:09.417
that could hurt you. I promise.

41:12.920 --> 41:13.750
Thank you.

41:16.970 --> 41:19.882
[Tyler] Pictures keep secrets,
just like people do.

41:22.810 --> 41:25.096
[girls] ...four, five, six, seven, eight.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.392
One, two, three, four, five, six...

41:28.480 --> 41:30.141
-Jessica, hi!
-Hi! How are you?

41:30.230 --> 41:32.391
-You look good.
-I am good. Thank you.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.310
-Hi, I missed you.
-Oh, God, I missed you.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.311
-Jess!
-Hey, Chle.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.310
Jess, it's so good to have you back.

41:38.410 --> 41:41.789
And just in time. We're starting
our routining for summer competitions.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.407
-And I want you to be a flyer.
-Wait. Wait, what?

41:45.500 --> 41:48.492
-I thought I was supposed--
-You have the athleticism and focus.

41:49.460 --> 41:52.702
And hey, it's work,
but you're ready, right?

41:53.050 --> 41:55.086
Totally. I'm totally ready.

41:55.510 --> 41:58.081
All right.
Well, let's start marking it out.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.058
Jess, this one's new,
so maybe watch first time around.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.174
Okay, cool.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.050
[whistle tweeting]

42:19.740 --> 42:22.823
[coach] All right, Walker, all right.
Let's try that slider again.

42:28.540 --> 42:31.282
That's right, guys, get it together.
Let's talk it through.

42:31.500 --> 42:32.410
[exhales]

42:32.500 --> 42:35.583
[girls] Five, six, seven...
One, two, three, four...

42:35.840 --> 42:38.877
-[Zach] You all right, man?
-Yeah, of course. Why?

42:39.090 --> 42:41.968
Well, that's three I had to chase.
I already did wind sprints today.

42:42.050 --> 42:45.133
Yeah, the breaking shit isn't breaking.

42:45.470 --> 42:48.803
[girls] One, two, three, lift,
five, six, seven, eight.

42:48.890 --> 42:51.302
-One, two, three...
-Hey, it's all right. You got this.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.646
[boy] Maybe you can throw something
he can hit?

42:53.730 --> 42:55.106
I'm just picking grass out here.

42:55.190 --> 42:58.193
I'm not gonna make the obvious joke
about Mexicans picking shit.

42:58.360 --> 43:01.363
All right, let's go, Walker.
The infields are trying to be funny,

43:01.530 --> 43:04.192
-and that never works.
-Oh, you love us, Dempsey.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.535
[coach] Last batter, Walker.

43:07.710 --> 43:08.950
Then you gotta ice that arm.

43:09.830 --> 43:12.628
[girls] ..._set, one, lift, three,
up, five, snx, seven...

43:12.710 --> 43:14.701
So, you're sure
your dad's not gonna come up?

43:14.800 --> 43:17.337
-Yeah, he visits as little as possible.
-Okay.

43:17.420 --> 43:18.466
Anyway, he likes you.

43:19.260 --> 43:22.297
Yeah, we bonded
those first few weeks I visited you.

43:23.010 --> 43:24.841
-What'd you bring?
-Okay, so...

43:26.770 --> 43:27.725
Cool Ranch Doritos.

43:30.230 --> 43:32.767
-Sour Patch Kids.
-Yes. Fucking amazing.

43:34.270 --> 43:36.647
So this is really, like, illegal?

43:36.980 --> 43:38.561
Yeah, my mom has me on all like,

43:39.400 --> 43:41.812
organic whole-grain macrobiotic shit.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.167
-So good. You want?
-[laughs]

43:52.370 --> 43:54.668
Uh, yeah, but I should probably
wash my hands first.

44:27.530 --> 44:28.781
[Alex] That's where it went.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.492
The bullet. That's where it went.

44:34.960 --> 44:38.168
Yeah, I had never shot
that kind of gun before,

44:38.250 --> 44:42.038
so it was heavier than the other ones,
and I flinched.

44:42.130 --> 44:47.090
And the bullet went up, and then
in and out of my skull and into the wall.

44:47.390 --> 44:48.505
That's what they told me.

44:50.810 --> 44:51.799
You don't remember?

44:52.850 --> 44:56.684
No, I don't remember anything
of like, a month before that.

44:57.310 --> 45:00.063
So, the tapes?

45:02.110 --> 45:03.099
I know about them.

45:03.610 --> 45:05.316
And I know we all did shit, but...

45:05.820 --> 45:07.697
I don't remember listening to them.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.656
I took pictures of you...

45:11.620 --> 45:13.030
while you were in your coma.

45:14.540 --> 45:15.359
Why?

45:15.960 --> 45:17.780
Because I knew you were gonna get better.

45:19.340 --> 45:23.504
So I wanted to like, document...
how far you had to go.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.005
I'm sorry, I...

45:26.090 --> 45:28.092
I-I don't care.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.589
Could I see them?

45:34.890 --> 45:35.720
Sometime?

45:40.360 --> 45:41.179
Yeah.

45:41.900 --> 45:44.448
Concession stand is almost done.

45:44.530 --> 45:47.772
We're gonna be putting finishing touches
on the outfield fence.

45:47.870 --> 45:50.612
The new scoreboard's going up there,
we're gonna re-line the fields,

45:50.700 --> 45:53.032
and get all the details done
before Thursday.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.075
All right.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.400
How about the naming?

45:55.660 --> 45:57.708
Oh, well, it goes on top
of the scoreboard,

45:58.080 --> 45:59.991
both dugouts and the concession stand.

46:00.090 --> 46:03.799
-But all the plaques are up.
-And we don't think this trial...

46:04.760 --> 46:07.581
we don't think this trial
will be a distraction, do we?

46:07.680 --> 46:10.342
No, no, no. No, no, no.
We have everything very well contained.

46:10.430 --> 46:13.012
-We're protecting our students.
-Good. Good.

46:13.470 --> 46:14.425
How's the team?

46:14.730 --> 46:20.305
Oh. Uh, well, despite the tragic loss
of Jeff Atkins,

46:21.480 --> 46:25.189
I'm told we still have the best team
In years. Since your time, even.

46:25.740 --> 46:26.809
[both chuckle]

46:27.400 --> 46:28.310
[Bryce] Hey, Dad.

46:30.570 --> 46:31.446
How's the arm?

46:31.990 --> 46:33.196
One hundred percent.

46:33.290 --> 46:34.746
[chuckles] Okay.

46:37.250 --> 46:38.535
See you later. Bye.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.627
-Hey, Bethany,
-[Scott] Right there.

46:41.710 --> 46:43.166
That dude got demolished.

46:43.460 --> 46:45.371
-Oh, hey.
-Ow.

46:45.590 --> 46:48.081
[Bryce] Hey, Jess. Jessica.

46:49.680 --> 46:51.500
-Hey, Jess, wait up.
-Hey.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.421
-Hey. Welcome back.
-Thank you.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.300
So, how you doing? Okay?

46:57.730 --> 47:00.517
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.
-Good. Good.

47:00.600 --> 47:04.388
I mean, it's good to have you back.
We missed you. The squad did, for sure.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.313
-Yeah, well, I'm back.
-Cool.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.657
Hey, let's grab a drink sometime.
Catch up.

47:13.030 --> 47:14.657
-Let's grab a drink?
-Yeah.

47:17.500 --> 47:19.957
Whatever. I'm late for dinner.

47:20.580 --> 47:21.410
Okay.

47:25.130 --> 47:26.119
-Hey, baby.
-Hi.

47:39.980 --> 47:41.550
[Jackie] Thanks for having me over.

47:43.150 --> 47:45.220
I'm happy to have the company.

In the evenings,

47:47.730 --> 47:51.439

and Rotarians, and...

47:52.950 --> 47:55.862
-I'm just glad you're not sick of me yet.
-No, never.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.610
Today was a good day, Olivia.

47:59.450 --> 48:00.781
Tyler was believable,

48:00.870 --> 48:04.169
and the jury will remember the bullying
more than anything else.

48:05.290 --> 48:06.370
What are you working on?

48:07.170 --> 48:08.000
Oh, um...

48:09.090 --> 48:12.582
-I asked Dennighto send over...

48:12.680 --> 48:14.716
...some of the discovery
that came up today.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.017
I always thought these pictures
were so beautiful.

48:18.220 --> 48:19.926

48:26.320 --> 48:27.514
No, too much chin.

48:28.230 --> 48:30.482
[sighs] Don't worry.
I'm deleting all of them.

48:31.030 --> 48:33.237
I'm never taking another picture again
in my life.

48:33.490 --> 48:34.309
Why?

48:35.320 --> 48:38.824
A picture can be twisted,
used against you, and haunt you forever.

48:39.490 --> 48:41.572
My dear Hannah. Such drama.

48:48.090 --> 48:49.955
Why didn't I just tell her she was pretty?

48:50.800 --> 48:53.872
Why didn't I just say she was perfect?

48:53.970 --> 48:56.347
Oh, Olivia. You did.

48:56.430 --> 48:58.421
I know you did, thousands of times.

48:58.510 --> 48:59.716
I don't know if I did.

49:00.890 --> 49:02.266
Or I didn't enough, or...

49:03.020 --> 49:04.510
or not in the right way.

49:06.480 --> 49:07.890
Every morning, I would tell Tessa

49:07.980 --> 49:10.107
she was the most beautiful girl
in the world.

49:11.650 --> 49:14.392
Then she would go to that school
where kids called her "ugly,"

49:15.280 --> 49:17.157
called her "worthless,"

49:17.740 --> 49:18.900
called her "slut."

49:19.910 --> 49:22.196
And she believed them, and not me.

49:23.540 --> 49:25.417
This is what it's gonna be like, isn't it?

49:25.710 --> 49:29.248
They're going to paint this picture
of some girl I don't even recognize.

49:29.340 --> 49:30.159
Yes.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.455
But you're going to have to stay strong.

49:33.380 --> 49:34.756
You know who Hannah was.

49:35.880 --> 49:36.756
What if I don't?

49:37.930 --> 49:39.841
I didn't know who took these pictures.

49:39.930 --> 49:42.979
I didn't know she had a stalker.
What else don't I know?

49:43.060 --> 49:44.880
You know how special she was.

49:46.020 --> 49:48.932
And how that school
let her be taken away from you.

49:56.030 --> 49:57.520
[Tyler] You have these pictures of Hannah.

49:59.910 --> 50:02.151
And you say they mean one thing,
but you don't know.

50:04.540 --> 50:07.418
Just because you have the picture
doesn't mean you have the truth.

50:13.300 --> 50:14.836
[Clay] Why'd you lie about Hannah?

50:16.550 --> 50:17.539
I didn't lie.

50:17.630 --> 50:19.507
Why would she be sexting,
after what happened?

50:19.590 --> 50:21.421
I don't know, but it was the truth.

50:21.510 --> 50:23.421
[scoffs] Then who was it with?

50:23.520 --> 50:25.511
-I'm not afraid of you.
-What's that mean?

50:25.600 --> 50:28.228
-The darkroom last night? Come on.
-What about the darkroom?

50:28.310 --> 50:30.892
-Someone's trying to keep me quiet.
-Yeah, well, it wasn't me.

50:31.020 --> 50:32.567
Then I bet they'll come after you, too.

50:33.400 --> 50:35.891
I don't fucking care.
Who was she texting with?

50:36.610 --> 50:37.520
I don't know.

50:39.530 --> 50:40.485
Fuck this.

50:40.740 --> 50:42.981
I know you thought she was perfect,
but she wasn't.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.071
I bet I'm not the only one who knows that.

51:07.230 --> 51:08.970
Wal-Plex locked up
their spray paint again,

51:09.060 --> 51:11.767
so I had to jack it from the True Value.

51:12.650 --> 51:16.359
I love how the Wal-Plex locks up
spray paint but not their ammunition.

Sorry, I don't know what happened.

51:58.820 --> 51:59.684
Okay.

52:00.490 --> 52:01.559
What...?

52:01.700 --> 52:03.907
Oh, my God, you're shaking. What's wrong?

52:04.990 --> 52:07.732
Nothing, I'm... I'm fine.

This is gonna be okay, you know?
You're gonna be great.

Yeah, no, I know.
I mean, I don't know. I mean, that's not--

52:19.090 --> 52:20.660
Okay, shut up and get naked.

52:21.680 --> 52:22.749
[Clay chuckles]

52:35.440 --> 52:36.395
What the fuck?

52:39.860 --> 52:41.737
What is wrong with you tonight, Clay?

52:43.030 --> 52:43.849
I can't.

-No, I--

52:49.040 --> 52:51.747
Look, I do. God, I do.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.161
You don't want to touch me,
to be with me.

52:54.250 --> 52:56.161
No, I do, I just...

52:58.800 --> 53:00.040
I can't tonight.

53:03.220 --> 53:04.039
Okay.

53:06.470 --> 53:07.926
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

53:16.440 --> 53:19.398
[Tyler] Unless you were there,
you don't know what really happened.

54:10.700 --> 54:12.986
We'll ask the court
for a medical exception.

54:13.120 --> 54:15.611
I hear that Standall kid
might not have to testify.

-Honey...

54:17.790 --> 54:19.701
your mother and I don't like this.

54:20.340 --> 54:23.298
We read about what happened to Tyler.
They can ask anything up there.

54:23.380 --> 54:24.756
But I have to do it.

54:25.970 --> 54:26.868

So you talk now?
