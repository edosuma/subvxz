- Yes, sir.
All right, Doc, I'll tell him.

04:04.658 --> 04:05.900
Thank you, bye.

04:05.969 --> 04:08.248
Jimmy, Doc wants
you at headquarters.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.919
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.510
How's he working out?

04:29.579 --> 04:32.030
- He does his job and shuts
his mouth, for the most part.

04:32.099 --> 04:33.273
- Yeah.

04:35.689 --> 04:37.622
You iron things
out with Beth?

04:37.691 --> 04:39.796
- I'm afraid that ship's
already sailed, sir.

04:39.865 --> 04:42.178
- You'd better start
swimming after it.

04:42.247 --> 04:43.869
She's the reason
you're here, Big Fella.

05:03.682 --> 05:04.890
- Tate?

05:10.620 --> 05:12.173
Tate?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.146
Tate?

05:21.942 --> 05:23.184
Tate!

05:36.370 --> 05:38.821
- He's sniffing
at those deer tracks.

05:38.890 --> 05:39.856
- Yeah, looks like it.

05:42.065 --> 05:43.653
Here, let me show you something.

05:46.069 --> 05:47.899
See how this front track here

05:47.968 --> 05:49.107
is deeper on the outside there?

05:49.176 --> 05:50.798
- Yeah.

05:50.867 --> 05:54.043
- Means it was looking back
over its left shoulder.

05:56.908 --> 06:00.049
You like to track, huh?
Might have a job for you.

06:00.118 --> 06:03.880
- You should probably name him
before you put him to work.

06:03.949 --> 06:06.296
- I don't know.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.747
"Dog" seems to be working out
just fine.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.681
- You busy today?

06:11.750 --> 06:14.132
- Depends how quick
we find those horses.

06:14.201 --> 06:16.065
If we find 'em at all.

06:16.134 --> 06:18.895
- Ah, so you're working
for miss pouty lips.

06:18.964 --> 06:21.070
- I'm working for the
state of Montana, baby.

06:21.139 --> 06:22.692
Same as every other day.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.869
Fine.

06:26.938 --> 06:29.458
I'll just work cases for
ugly women from here on out.

06:29.527 --> 06:32.150
- Oh, so you think she's pretty?

06:32.219 --> 06:34.152
- Walked right into
that one, Dad.

06:38.363 --> 06:40.123
- We need to name the dog.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.540
Dad just wants
to call her "Dog."

06:42.609 --> 06:44.611
And I think
that sucks pickled ass.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.371
- Hey. Not at the table.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.338
Not anywhere for that matter.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.374
He's your son, I swear.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.375
- I'm not done.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.894
- You're done now.

06:53.654 --> 06:54.897
- You owe me one.

07:11.085 --> 07:12.432
- You're one of those, huh?

07:13.916 --> 07:15.607
- One of what?

07:15.676 --> 07:18.230
- The kind of man who uses
flowers to say "I'm sorry"

07:18.299 --> 07:21.717
because he doesn't have
the balls to say it himself.

07:21.786 --> 07:23.166
I don't want those
fucking things.

07:36.110 --> 07:38.837
- I need a ride into town.

07:38.906 --> 07:40.149
Would you give me one?

07:41.564 --> 07:42.738
- What do you need in town?

07:47.294 --> 07:49.261
cleaning up horse shit,
sleeping in a barn...

07:50.780 --> 07:51.919
I don't have any friends.

07:52.920 --> 07:53.921
Not even you.

07:56.027 --> 07:58.270
I'll take my chances
in foster care.

08:01.446 --> 08:03.793
- You're 14, kid.

08:03.862 --> 08:06.727
In four years the world
says that you're a man.

08:06.796 --> 08:09.109
But you're not,
that's what it says.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.837
What becomes of you then?

08:12.906 --> 08:14.977
- I don't know.

08:15.046 --> 08:16.496
- What do you want to become?

08:18.463 --> 08:19.499
What's your dream?

08:22.053 --> 08:23.261
- Don't have any dreams.

08:24.676 --> 08:25.988
- No?

08:26.057 --> 08:27.507
- I'm too busy trying
to figure out

08:27.576 --> 08:29.301
what I'm gonna eat
and where I'm gonna sleep.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.408
Dreams...

08:35.480 --> 08:36.516
- Come here.

08:48.493 --> 08:52.946
You do what I ask
the way I say do it.

08:54.499 --> 08:57.260
You ask questions
when you don't understand.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.539
You ask questions
when you do understand.

09:00.919 --> 09:02.887
Never lie to me.

09:06.097 --> 09:08.030
Can you make that
promise and keep it?

09:11.343 --> 09:12.379
- I can keep it.

09:17.660 --> 09:18.903
- Shake on it.

09:27.843 --> 09:29.879
- If I don't give you flowers
when I'm sorry,

09:29.948 --> 09:31.881
when do I give 'em?

09:31.950 --> 09:33.883
- You give 'em for
no reason, buddy.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.368
No reason at all.

10:24.106 --> 10:25.383
- You Jimmy?

10:25.452 --> 10:26.384
- Uh, yes, ma'am..

10:26.453 --> 10:27.627
- Open that for me.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.572
- Is this some kind of
exercise room?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.298
-
Sort of.

10:49.338 --> 10:51.305
All right, get ready.
- Ready for what?

10:51.374 --> 10:53.135
- Put this sleeve over his
penis and hold it.

10:53.204 --> 10:55.896
- What?
- Go, now! Do it!

11:00.832 --> 11:02.075
All right, you got
to hold it there.

11:05.595 --> 11:06.942
Got to get it all.
Hold it there.

11:19.644 --> 11:20.610
Okay, remove it.

11:32.001 --> 11:34.141
- I just jacked off a horse.

11:34.210 --> 11:35.833
- Get used to it. We've got
fifteen more to collect.

11:38.283 --> 11:39.906
All right, bring that
into the lab. That door there.

11:42.184 --> 11:47.983
- Just jacked off a horse.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.170
- You like his one?

12:04.171 --> 12:05.138
What does that mean?

12:21.602 --> 12:22.672
Boo!

12:23.743 --> 12:24.674
- He's going to be
a good father.

12:27.436 --> 12:28.609
- That's questionable...

12:29.783 --> 12:32.165
considering who taught him.

12:32.234 --> 12:33.476
- I'm teaching him now.

12:35.962 --> 12:39.103
You know, most people, they
end up making the same mistakes

12:39.172 --> 12:40.587
their parents made

12:40.656 --> 12:42.934
because they were still children
when they had children.

12:44.246 --> 12:45.247
I know I was...

12:48.595 --> 12:53.220
Jamie's endured 40 long years

12:53.289 --> 12:55.982
learning how not to father,
how not to lead.

12:58.122 --> 13:00.434
Hard lessons both,
but he learned them.

13:01.504 --> 13:04.093
- He does seems different.

13:04.162 --> 13:06.026
More like the man
I wanted him to be.

13:07.683 --> 13:09.098
- I have a favor to ask.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.550
- Look, I'm here.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.586
I just...

13:14.655 --> 13:18.073
I'm gonna need some time
before I trust him again.

13:20.903 --> 13:22.732
- Do you trust him to be
a good politician?

13:24.527 --> 13:28.255
- I never doubted him
as a politician.

13:28.324 --> 13:29.601
- How 'bout a governor?

13:32.225 --> 13:34.986
The election's
a ways off, but...

13:35.055 --> 13:37.092
these things need
planning, don't they? I mean...

13:39.335 --> 13:44.133
Relationships beyond district
attorneys and cattlemen.

13:44.202 --> 13:45.583
What kind of relationship
do you have?

13:49.759 --> 13:51.209
Anyway, that's the favor.

13:56.525 --> 13:58.009
- What do you see?

13:58.078 --> 13:59.631
- Well, he looks
like a governor.

14:01.461 --> 14:02.531
- Yes, he does.

14:09.503 --> 14:11.505
- Hello.
Who are you here to see?

14:11.574 --> 14:14.232
- Not here to see a who.
Here to see a thing.

14:14.301 --> 14:15.337
- What thing?

14:16.441 --> 14:18.305
- My office.

14:18.374 --> 14:19.651
- Miss Dutton.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.999
- Winner winner turkey dinner.
-

14:22.068 --> 14:23.103
Right this way.

14:33.527 --> 14:35.736
- It's the corner office
right down here.

14:37.497 --> 14:40.155
This is Miss Dutton.

14:40.224 --> 14:41.501
- It's a pleasure to finally...

14:58.311 --> 15:00.934
- All this shit has to go.

15:01.003 --> 15:02.418
- Ma'am?

15:02.487 --> 15:05.180
- I feel like I'm in my
fucking gynecologist's office.

15:05.249 --> 15:07.734
- I'll get the design team to--

15:07.803 --> 15:09.218
- Nope. I'll do it myself.

15:11.669 --> 15:12.601
What's your name?

15:12.670 --> 15:13.602
- Cal.

15:13.671 --> 15:15.535
- Where you from, Cal?

15:15.604 --> 15:18.158
Menlo Park.

15:18.227 --> 15:21.196
- Palo Alto, right next to it.
How'd you guess that?

15:21.265 --> 15:23.612
- I just read
the tea leaves, buddy.

15:23.681 --> 15:28.168
- Ooh, um, there's
no smoking in the, uh...

15:30.308 --> 15:32.172
It's probably fine.

15:32.241 --> 15:34.692
- How long you been
boinking the receptionist?

15:36.245 --> 15:37.660
- Ma'am?

15:37.729 --> 15:40.180
- You know how that's
gonna end, dontcha?

15:40.249 --> 15:43.563
I need my assistants

15:43.632 --> 15:47.670
to put all their efforts
into not being pussies, okay?

15:47.739 --> 15:50.190
I do not need them chasing it.

15:50.259 --> 15:51.916
- You want me break up with her?

15:51.985 --> 15:54.160
- I want you to find
another job.

15:54.229 --> 15:56.645
I'm 0 for three
with assistants anyway.

15:56.714 --> 15:59.268
Turns out working for me
is pretty fucking dangerous.

15:59.337 --> 16:01.995
- I'm-I'm...

16:02.064 --> 16:03.272
I'm not really sure
what you're asking.

16:03.341 --> 16:05.240
- I'm not asking
you anything, Cal.

16:05.309 --> 16:07.794
I'm firing you.
Get the fuck out of my office.

16:07.863 --> 16:09.416
I'll get my own coffee.

16:11.832 --> 16:13.731
Hey, Cal?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.422
- Yeah.
- Shut my fucking door.

16:15.491 --> 16:16.561
- Yep.

16:27.434 --> 16:28.435
- All right.

16:34.303 --> 16:36.650
-
Not looking too fired, Cal.

16:40.585 --> 16:42.415
- Phase one is white,

16:42.484 --> 16:45.314
phase two, green,

16:45.383 --> 16:48.490
phase three, blue,

16:48.559 --> 16:51.424
phase four, yellow.

16:52.632 --> 16:54.358
Now, you'll notice in phase one,

16:54.427 --> 16:57.361
we lay infrastructure
for all following phases.

16:57.430 --> 17:00.640
- So, you're laying in
roadways, electric, sewage

17:00.709 --> 17:03.194
for all phases in phase one?

17:03.263 --> 17:06.232
- In the long term
it's much more cost effective.

17:06.301 --> 17:08.889
Laying infrastructure
in phases triples the cost.

17:08.958 --> 17:10.822
- Kyle, this makes assumptions
about land ownership

17:10.891 --> 17:12.341
that we can't make.

17:12.410 --> 17:15.620
- Uh, not the time or the place.
This is a design meeting.

17:15.689 --> 17:18.244
- Can I see an ownership
plat over this?

17:18.313 --> 17:20.039
- It's not relevant
at this time.

17:20.108 --> 17:24.491
- Well, if you're building roads
and sewers on land

17:24.560 --> 17:27.598
that you don't own, I'd say
it's pretty fucking relevant.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.807
- Well, I guess we're going
to find out who you're
loyal to, Beth.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.156
- No one mentioned this to me.

17:34.225 --> 17:35.813
- Beth, there are two terminals.

17:35.882 --> 17:38.367
That's fifty-two gates.
You saw the airport design.

17:38.436 --> 17:39.920
- Yes.

17:39.989 --> 17:42.164
- So who did you think
those gates were for?

17:42.233 --> 17:43.683
Hmm?

17:43.752 --> 17:46.789
You said it yourself,
you'd turn it into Park City.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.999
Well, this is Park City.

18:03.841 --> 18:05.843
- Bring to push. Push.

18:05.912 --> 18:07.879
- Ha, ha!
Ha!

18:07.948 --> 18:10.192
- Steer. Steer, steer!

18:10.261 --> 18:13.195
- Show them how it's done,
would you, Scout?

18:13.264 --> 18:16.164
Two of them coming,
both heifers.

18:16.233 --> 18:17.751
- Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

18:17.820 --> 18:19.201
- Heifer, heifer, heifer!

18:23.516 --> 18:25.104
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.864
Watch Mama here.

18:29.315 --> 18:31.179
- Let's do it.
- Keep going.

18:31.248 --> 18:33.388
- Boss man's got steer.
Watch your coke.

18:37.254 --> 18:39.290
- Ha!

18:43.156 --> 18:44.744
- Let's snake those
three there, huh?

18:44.813 --> 18:47.298
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:47.367 --> 18:48.713
Hey, hey, hey!

18:51.371 --> 18:53.166
- I count 81.

18:53.235 --> 18:54.374
- That's what I got, too, sir.

18:56.411 --> 18:57.895
- My count's 81.

18:57.964 --> 19:01.140
- Yep, 81 it is.

19:01.209 --> 19:03.314
Get 'em to the sale, Rip.
- All right.

19:03.383 --> 19:05.558
- I'll start looking through
the rest of these heifers.

19:05.627 --> 19:06.869
- Thanks, Jack.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.077
How are the boys?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.770
-
They're sore as shit.

19:10.839 --> 19:13.497
I'm gonna give them
a few days to sleep it off.

19:13.566 --> 19:16.396
- Man.
Guess he's done sleeping.

19:16.465 --> 19:17.466
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.571 --> 19:19.710
- Where y'all need me?

19:19.779 --> 19:20.952
- Start sorting heifers.

19:27.683 --> 19:28.995
- Could I have a word, sir?

19:33.310 --> 19:34.656
- She talking to me?

19:34.725 --> 19:38.660
- I believe she said
she wants a word.

19:38.729 --> 19:41.421
- I can't understand a damn word
coming out of her mouth.

19:48.980 --> 19:49.981
Yeah?

19:53.019 --> 19:54.158
- Sir...

19:56.195 --> 19:59.646
Whatever's between Walker
and Lloyd, it's got

19:59.715 --> 20:01.441
nothin' to do with me.

20:01.510 --> 20:03.305
Nothin' to do with
Laramie either.

20:03.374 --> 20:06.515
That was just their excuse.

20:06.584 --> 20:11.693
I was the first one up every
mornin' and the last to be done.

20:11.762 --> 20:13.867
Ask him.

20:13.936 --> 20:16.318
Ask him if anyone
works harder'n me.

20:16.387 --> 20:17.906
- She ain't lying, sir.

20:21.634 --> 20:23.567
- So fight wasn't over you, huh?

20:23.636 --> 20:25.500
- No, sir.

20:25.569 --> 20:27.571
- You just did your job.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.055
- Ever' day.

20:29.124 --> 20:30.746
- Never fooled around
with anyone in the bunkhouse?

20:33.301 --> 20:35.268
- Ain't no one said I couldn't.

20:35.337 --> 20:36.787
- Well, common sense says
you shouldn't

20:36.856 --> 20:39.203
'cause the next fight
will be over you.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.171
- So all that "this is my home
forever" is just talk?

20:44.588 --> 20:46.245
Fucking scarred for life
and it don't mean nothin'?

20:51.526 --> 20:53.010
- You wait over
there a minute.

20:58.429 --> 20:59.568
When the hell did that happen?

21:01.432 --> 21:03.054
- The night that
we took care of that thing

21:03.123 --> 21:05.264
in the forest for ya.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.507
- So, they all wear it.

21:07.576 --> 21:08.543
- Yes, sir.

21:10.545 --> 21:12.547
- And it just slipped your mind
to fucking mention it to me?

21:13.893 --> 21:15.204
- It was the night
before you got hit.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.551
Before everyone got hit.

21:18.346 --> 21:19.312
- Does Kayce know about this?

21:19.381 --> 21:20.693
- Sir, it ain't his fault.

21:20.762 --> 21:21.970
I should've come to you
and talked to you.

21:22.039 --> 21:23.937
- Does he know?

21:24.006 --> 21:25.007
- Yes, sir, he does.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.325
- Jesus.

21:41.369 --> 21:42.508
- Teeter?

21:47.513 --> 21:49.584
Where's your gear at?

21:49.653 --> 21:52.345
- Everything I own's in
the back seat of my truck.

21:52.414 --> 21:55.106
- Go on and grab it.
Put it back in the bunkhouse.

21:58.489 --> 22:01.768
- Thank you.
- Okay. All right.

22:04.046 --> 22:06.808
Sorry... But thank you.

22:08.879 --> 22:11.813
I don't know, do you
need help with... shit?

22:11.882 --> 22:13.539
- Teeter, just go
grab your gear.

22:16.714 --> 22:18.820
And hey.

22:18.889 --> 22:20.511
This means something.

22:21.857 --> 22:23.411
- Yes, sir.

22:52.923 --> 22:55.132
Well, you have an odd
definition of retirement.

22:55.201 --> 22:57.272
- Yeah, well, I never
retired from this.

23:00.206 --> 23:01.828
When Governors
drop by unannounced,

23:01.897 --> 23:05.038
it's either real good or...
real bad.

23:06.315 --> 23:07.869
- You wanna walk with me?

23:08.870 --> 23:10.492
- Oh, boy.

23:10.561 --> 23:12.598
Unannounced and "walk with me."

23:12.667 --> 23:13.909
I'm in for it, aren't I?

23:22.608 --> 23:23.885
- You got it?

23:23.954 --> 23:26.232
- You know I used to just
jump over these.

23:30.236 --> 23:31.548
- Oh!
- Okay.

23:31.617 --> 23:32.928
- Well done.
- All right.

23:36.656 --> 23:37.761
- Hit me with it.

23:40.073 --> 23:41.247
- I'm running for Senate.

23:47.978 --> 23:50.946
I don't know, Lynelle.

23:51.015 --> 23:53.673
Washington is a different snake.

23:53.742 --> 23:55.951
- Well, I'm a politician, John.

23:56.020 --> 23:59.092
I gotta go where I believe I can
make the biggest difference.

23:59.161 --> 24:01.785
There's no one in Washington
now that's doing that.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.203
They've lost
the art of compromise.

24:06.272 --> 24:07.756
The art of negotiation.

24:08.826 --> 24:10.725
Those are my greatest skills.

24:10.794 --> 24:13.555
- Well, I can think of a few
others you're a master of.

24:17.007 --> 24:18.457
Stewart running for
Governor, then?

24:18.526 --> 24:20.079
- Oh Stewart...

24:20.148 --> 24:21.943
Stewart's sleeping until noon
and then playing 9 holes.

24:22.012 --> 24:23.254
No, Stewart's done.

24:23.323 --> 24:25.705
I think the Governor's office
is ready

24:25.774 --> 24:27.500
for a new generation of leader.

24:27.569 --> 24:29.502
I think Jamie
can take the responsibility--

24:29.571 --> 24:31.573
- Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

24:31.642 --> 24:33.851
- He's got the name, which
we know is most important.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.164
And he navigated
that Market Equities development

24:36.233 --> 24:38.097
with a skill that not even I
credited him with--

24:38.166 --> 24:40.306
- Skill is not his weakness.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.929
This is his weakness.
It's too much power.

24:42.998 --> 24:44.586
And it isn't his name,
it's mine.

24:46.139 --> 24:48.038
There's other options.
Choose one of them.

24:48.107 --> 24:49.936
- The other options
don't want the Montana

24:50.005 --> 24:51.524
that you and I do.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.978
- Lynelle, there are things...

24:57.047 --> 24:59.256
there are things
about my son you do not know.

24:59.325 --> 25:01.948
Things that make him
unfit for your office.

25:02.017 --> 25:04.606
- He's the devil we know, John.

25:04.675 --> 25:06.746
I'll take the risk.

25:06.815 --> 25:08.645
I mean, unless you want to run
for governor,

25:08.714 --> 25:09.956
then I'll gladly endorse you.

25:10.025 --> 25:12.683
Listen, I just wanted
to tell you all this

25:12.752 --> 25:14.513
so that you weren't finding out
in the newspapers, all right?

25:18.793 --> 25:19.794
- Lynelle...

25:23.625 --> 25:25.489
- I'll take it.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.698
- Take it? Take what?

25:27.767 --> 25:30.839
- Your endorsement.
I'll take it.

25:30.908 --> 25:32.151
- You are going
to run for office

25:32.220 --> 25:33.946
just so that your son
doesn't get it?

25:34.015 --> 25:35.499
- That's how bad he'll be
for everything you and I

25:35.568 --> 25:38.226
worked so hard to protect.
He'll destroy it all.

25:40.918 --> 25:45.371
So if you want a devil
you really know, here he is.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.821
- The press is gonna come
at you hard, John.

25:46.890 --> 25:48.719
- Oh, don't I know it.

25:48.788 --> 25:50.065
- No, I mean, they're gonna
have a lot of questions

25:50.134 --> 25:51.826
about all the
things that you've done

25:51.895 --> 25:53.931
and you're going to have to
find a way to defend them.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.312
- Not gonna defend a thing.

25:57.694 --> 25:59.972
"Damn right, I did it"
is gonna be my campaign slogan.

26:02.388 --> 26:05.322
- Oh, geez.
Yeah, that would be your slogan.

26:05.391 --> 26:06.737
- Yeah.

26:10.465 --> 26:13.192
- I... I did not see
this one coming, John.

26:13.261 --> 26:15.574
- Yeah. I'm just...

26:15.643 --> 26:16.954
I'm just full of surprises.

26:18.956 --> 26:19.957
Fuck.

26:21.752 --> 26:23.133
Now I gotta run
for fucking Governor.

26:37.319 --> 26:39.252
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

26:42.808 --> 26:43.912
- You buying or selling?

26:50.022 --> 26:51.299
- Trading.

26:51.368 --> 26:52.714
- Trading what?

26:56.338 --> 26:59.859
- One of a kind.
- Wow.

26:59.928 --> 27:00.998
Are you sure?

27:03.380 --> 27:04.761
- Yep.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.920
- I'm Emily, by the way.

27:25.989 --> 27:27.784
- Jimmy.

27:27.853 --> 27:29.924
- Probably should've
introduced myself sooner.

27:29.993 --> 27:32.996
Masturbating stallions sort of
puts us on a first name basis.

27:34.031 --> 27:35.412
- At the very least.

27:36.585 --> 27:38.415
- So, you got a girlfriend?

27:38.484 --> 27:40.693
- Um...

27:40.762 --> 27:42.730
- Fuck, you're one
of six single guys

27:42.799 --> 27:44.628
in this county under thirty.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.113
I dated two of them and the
other three ain't worth a shit.

27:47.182 --> 27:48.839
So... I thought
I'd make my move

27:48.908 --> 27:50.979
before you go on
and get all scooped up.

27:51.048 --> 27:53.119
- Well, umm...

27:53.188 --> 27:55.156
Aside from the wrangler
I'm paired up with

27:55.225 --> 27:58.159
you're the first person
I've seen in, uh...

27:58.228 --> 27:59.678
I actually don't know
how long I've been here.

27:59.747 --> 28:01.610
So... I think my chances
of getting scooped up

28:01.680 --> 28:02.888
are pretty slim.

28:02.957 --> 28:04.855
- Let me buy you dinner.

28:06.029 --> 28:07.409
- No, I can't let you
buy me dinner.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.654
- You've got a girlfriend?

28:10.723 --> 28:12.138
- I don't know.

28:12.207 --> 28:13.622
- Let me buy you dinner.

28:15.452 --> 28:17.868
- No, I can't.

28:17.937 --> 28:18.904
- All right.

28:20.871 --> 28:21.838
- But, uh...

28:23.287 --> 28:24.530
I can buy you dinner.

28:26.221 --> 28:27.326
- All right.

28:45.068 --> 28:47.933
Fur is murder!
Fur is murder!

29:18.377 --> 29:20.275
- Of course, you'd shop here.

29:20.344 --> 29:22.968
- My idea of shopping is calling
the sales manager at Gucci

29:23.037 --> 29:25.039
and having her fill
a box the size

29:25.108 --> 29:27.075
of a fucking refrigerator.

29:27.144 --> 29:31.493
You think you're making
a difference? Hmm?

29:31.562 --> 29:33.875
Shaming some
plastic surgeon's wife

29:33.944 --> 29:36.705
out of buying a mink coat today?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.086
What does that save?
Not the mink.

29:38.155 --> 29:39.605
Mink's already dead.

29:39.674 --> 29:42.159
- Not the next mink.
- Yeah, he's dead too.

29:42.228 --> 29:44.955
Fifteen of you standing
in front of a store

29:45.024 --> 29:48.096
yelling at patrons?
That isn't making a difference.

29:48.165 --> 29:52.929
You know, this store is the
caboose of the problem, okay?

29:52.998 --> 29:56.622
The engine of the problem
doesn't know you exist.

29:56.691 --> 29:59.452
This isn't saving
the environment, sweetheart,

29:59.521 --> 30:03.249
this is just inflating your ego
with very little effort.

30:03.318 --> 30:06.045
And when mommy and daddy
get tired of bailing you out

30:06.114 --> 30:09.704
and subsidizing this utter
waste of time, you'll go away.

30:09.773 --> 30:13.432
Meanwhile, the world
continues getting raped.

30:13.501 --> 30:14.813
- What the hell do you know

30:14.882 --> 30:17.298
about protecting
the environment?

30:22.130 --> 30:24.512
- I know they're building
an international airport

30:24.581 --> 30:27.101
15 miles from the national park.

30:27.170 --> 30:29.413
And a ski resort the size
of Crested Butte.

30:29.482 --> 30:31.312
And condos and hotels

30:31.381 --> 30:33.210
and shopping plazas
and restaurants

30:33.279 --> 30:36.593
in the most fragile ecosystem
in North America.

30:36.662 --> 30:38.146
But you know,
you just keep protesting

30:38.215 --> 30:40.010
'til happy-hour, honey.

30:40.079 --> 30:42.461
Then you can sip
your skinny margaritas

30:42.530 --> 30:46.292
and pat yourself on the back
and you'll all get drunk enough

30:46.361 --> 30:49.951
to stanch the stench of
the couscous-eating hippie

30:50.020 --> 30:51.297
you fuck tonight.

30:51.366 --> 30:53.196
- Did you make that up
about the airport?

30:55.784 --> 30:57.131
- Give me your phone.

31:05.933 --> 31:10.247
This one, this is a little
above your pay grade.

31:13.837 --> 31:15.252
This one takes effort.

31:17.254 --> 31:19.843
Strategy.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.570
Sacrifice.

31:22.639 --> 31:24.917
Risk, real risk,

31:24.986 --> 31:27.126
not that bullshit that
you pulled with my brother.

31:27.195 --> 31:29.094
- Why the fuck do they
need another airport?

31:29.163 --> 31:30.992
- They're not in the
business of need, sweetheart.

31:31.061 --> 31:32.407
They're in the business of want.

31:32.476 --> 31:33.684
And they want it because
it's going to make them

31:33.753 --> 31:35.755
a shit-ton of money
and they do not care

31:35.824 --> 31:38.241
how many animals they
have to kill to build it.

31:54.222 --> 31:55.914
- Good dog.

31:55.983 --> 31:57.950
Where'd you get him?

31:58.019 --> 32:00.746
- He just sort of
came with the house.

32:00.815 --> 32:01.885
- What's his name?

32:03.749 --> 32:04.853
- Just been calling him "dog."

32:07.408 --> 32:08.788
- That's what I call mine.

32:08.857 --> 32:10.031
Except I say it in Lakota.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.483
- What's dog in Lakota?

32:13.552 --> 32:14.898
- Sunka.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.969
- I like that.

32:17.038 --> 32:18.937
Mind if I call it Sunka?

32:19.006 --> 32:20.662
- He's your dog. You can
call him whatever you want.

32:22.216 --> 32:23.320
- Sunka!

32:26.116 --> 32:27.566
Looks like he
already knows it.

32:27.635 --> 32:30.086
- When you say it in their
language, they all know it.

33:06.053 --> 33:07.675
- You can't be here.

33:07.744 --> 33:11.437
- I'm Livestock Commissioner.
He's tribal police.

33:11.506 --> 33:12.680
These horses are property

33:12.749 --> 33:14.647
of the Confederated Tribes
at Broken Rock.

33:14.716 --> 33:18.030
- These are mustangs.
We rounded them up yesterday.

33:18.099 --> 33:20.550
- Mustangs don't have
shoes and brands.

33:24.347 --> 33:27.281
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

33:27.350 --> 33:29.352
- We herd them with
a helicopter.

33:29.421 --> 33:31.768
Don't get that good a look at
them 'til we trailer 'em up.

33:31.837 --> 33:34.150
- Trailer them to go where?

33:34.219 --> 33:36.221
- Auction, I guess.

33:36.290 --> 33:37.705
Some go to the prison.

33:37.774 --> 33:40.225
- These don't.
They're gonna come with us.

33:40.294 --> 33:41.640
- Got proof they're yours?

33:50.649 --> 33:52.030
Stolen you say?

33:52.099 --> 33:53.479
- Yeah, somebody
cut a hole in a fence,

33:53.548 --> 33:55.619
tried to herd 'em
with dirt bikes.

33:55.688 --> 33:57.138
Guess they didn't
want to be herded.

33:57.207 --> 33:59.968
-
Damn right they don't.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.556
Pain in the ass
getting them in here.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.663
Took two choppers
and half a damn day.

34:04.732 --> 34:07.390
Look, you know how

34:07.459 --> 34:10.186
when the wheels are in motion
they're impossible to stop.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.084
We're supposed
to herd them out Friday,

34:12.153 --> 34:15.294
but if you can get them
so be it.

34:15.363 --> 34:16.640
But I don't know
how you're going to do it.

34:16.709 --> 34:18.332
You can't get a truck back here

34:18.401 --> 34:20.403
and you damn sure can't
do it with other horses...

34:20.472 --> 34:22.991
- We'll see what we can
come up with.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.269
- Figure it out by Friday.

34:26.616 --> 34:28.963
- You got any ideas?
- I got an idea.

34:29.032 --> 34:31.345
- Care to share it?

34:31.414 --> 34:33.450
- This idea is hard to explain.

34:33.519 --> 34:35.314
You'll just have to see it.

34:45.221 --> 34:48.051
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not how you do it.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.190
Let me show ya.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.782
You're just tying it
like a knot.

34:54.851 --> 34:57.164
So, here's what you do.

34:57.233 --> 34:59.131
First of all, let's get
it set up right.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.514
So you're going to lay
it flat, right?

35:02.583 --> 35:04.861
And then what you're going
to do is your going to lay

35:04.930 --> 35:08.416
this piece goes down there,
flat, right?

35:08.485 --> 35:10.453
Then these come around twice.

35:10.522 --> 35:16.114
So you go once,
and then twice,

35:16.183 --> 35:18.357
And then you
pull it from here.

35:18.426 --> 35:20.152
And you pull it tight.

35:20.221 --> 35:22.810
Just like that.
Okay?

35:22.879 --> 35:26.434
I don't want you tying a knot
like some fucking team roper.

35:26.503 --> 35:28.126
Now, every piece

35:28.195 --> 35:33.234
your saddle, your stirrups,
your cinch, your reins,

35:33.303 --> 35:34.649
that's the thing that's
either gonna save you

35:34.718 --> 35:36.203
or it's gonna kill you.

35:36.272 --> 35:39.033
For instance,
if you dally a bull, right,

35:39.102 --> 35:41.760
and you break your rein
off your bridle

35:41.829 --> 35:45.419
it's usually because
either the leather is rotted

35:45.488 --> 35:47.559
or you tied a fucking
square knot... you understand?

35:50.113 --> 35:51.494
Here. I'll loosen it up.

35:51.563 --> 35:52.598
- Hey.

35:54.462 --> 35:57.258
Oh, you know, just watching
some feel-good movie on TV.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.434
Okay.

36:00.503 --> 36:03.575
- Remember to lay
this piece flat, right?

36:03.644 --> 36:05.680
- I gotta go up to the lodge.

36:05.749 --> 36:08.476
- Drive. I don't need you
getting eaten by a bear.

36:08.545 --> 36:10.547
- A bear knows better
than to fuck with me.

36:11.824 --> 36:12.825
Drive anyways.

36:14.241 --> 36:15.276
- Yes, sir.

36:19.660 --> 36:21.765
- Beautiful.

36:39.162 --> 36:40.508
- Need a drink?

36:55.523 --> 36:56.559
You look sad.

36:56.628 --> 36:59.700
- Nah, I--I look lonely.

36:59.769 --> 37:00.804
There's a difference.

37:08.053 --> 37:11.505
You know, my great grandfather
didn't build this place

37:11.574 --> 37:13.679
with the goal
of impressing anyone.

37:15.578 --> 37:17.200
The goal was to...

37:17.269 --> 37:19.064
the goal was to
just make it big enough

37:19.133 --> 37:22.032
that his children
never had to leave.

37:24.794 --> 37:26.174
But you left anyway.

37:28.763 --> 37:29.764
You all did...

37:33.389 --> 37:34.562
- Daddy, I...

37:35.736 --> 37:38.463
He's going to be my husband

37:38.532 --> 37:40.637
and my place is
sleeping beside him.

37:40.706 --> 37:42.950
- As it should be, honey.

37:43.019 --> 37:44.089
It's just I would...

37:45.849 --> 37:47.644
just like my family
under this roof

37:47.713 --> 37:50.923
and he is going
to be a part of my family.

37:54.444 --> 37:55.894
- You want us to move in here?

38:02.349 --> 38:03.695
Ask him.

38:03.764 --> 38:05.524
- I was...

38:05.593 --> 38:07.008
I was hoping you'd ask him.

38:09.597 --> 38:11.358
- Men.

38:11.427 --> 38:14.015
No, Daddy. I'm afraid
you're going to take

38:14.084 --> 38:16.949
an emotional risk
with another man.

38:17.018 --> 38:18.296
And I do mean ask.

38:19.711 --> 38:21.609
If you tell him to jump
off a fucking cliff,

38:21.678 --> 38:23.404
he's jumping off the cliff.
Okay?

38:23.473 --> 38:24.854
So you gotta ask him.

38:24.923 --> 38:26.165
Ask him what he would like...

38:27.753 --> 38:29.790
And then respect
the answer he gives.

38:32.344 --> 38:34.933
- Feel like I'm in
fucking couple's therapy.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.800
- If it walks like a duck
and talks like a duck...

38:41.319 --> 38:42.561
- Yeah.

38:45.702 --> 38:46.496
- Goodnight, Daddy.

38:46.565 --> 38:47.566
- Yeah.

38:50.086 --> 38:51.915
- Governor Perry's
running for Senate.

38:55.471 --> 38:57.300
She offered
Jamie her endorsement.

39:00.510 --> 39:03.237
How can such a shrewd
politician be so blind?

39:04.963 --> 39:07.310
- Doesn't matter.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.070
I convinced her to take it back.

39:14.731 --> 39:16.043
- How?

39:19.149 --> 39:21.462
- Mm.
Because she's giving it to me.

39:22.808 --> 39:25.052
I, uh...

39:25.121 --> 39:26.605
I couldn't think of
anything else to do, so--

39:28.814 --> 39:30.609
Honey, now--

39:30.678 --> 39:34.268
- Dad, now we control
the narrative.

39:34.337 --> 39:36.374
All right,
the first thing you do--

39:36.443 --> 39:37.996
- Honey.
- No, that's the second thing.

39:38.065 --> 39:41.379
The first thing is choosing
any of the fifty fucking things

39:41.448 --> 39:44.658
that Jamie has done that make
him unfit to hold public office,

39:44.727 --> 39:47.005
and then you remove his
fucking ass from the Capitol.

39:47.074 --> 39:48.972
Okay? The second thing--

39:49.041 --> 39:50.767
- Honey. You didn't
let me finish my sentence.

39:50.836 --> 39:52.976
What I was saying is now
I need you to help me

39:53.045 --> 39:57.533
find a way out of...
out of running.

39:57.602 --> 39:58.568
- Not on your life.

39:58.637 --> 40:00.018
- No, Beth, listen to me.

40:00.087 --> 40:01.502
I can't spend
the next four years

40:01.571 --> 40:03.297
of my life in Helena.

40:03.366 --> 40:06.093
- The ranch won't
be here in four years, Dad.

40:06.162 --> 40:08.371
Listen to me, as Governor,
you will have the power

40:08.440 --> 40:09.890
to withhold funds.

40:09.959 --> 40:12.410
You have the power
to reverse state land grants.

40:12.479 --> 40:14.791
You have the power to shut
that fucking airport down.

40:14.860 --> 40:17.553
You have the power to
withhold building applications

40:17.622 --> 40:19.071
and tax exemptions.

40:19.140 --> 40:21.695
You have the power to
withhold gambling licenses.

40:21.764 --> 40:24.491
You have the power to run those
fuckers out of this valley

40:24.560 --> 40:26.907
and then you get to pass a law
so they can never return.

40:30.842 --> 40:33.016
You always tell me
that there is a way,

40:33.085 --> 40:36.468
another way to save
this ranch without selling.

40:36.537 --> 40:38.988
So this is the way.
Tell me there's another.

40:41.508 --> 40:42.509
This is the way.

40:45.719 --> 40:46.789
You know that, don't you?

40:50.724 --> 40:52.726
- Yeah, honey.
I just...

40:52.795 --> 40:54.037
Just wish it wasn't.

40:56.557 --> 40:57.524
- Dad?

41:02.839 --> 41:04.496
- I'm going to help you.

41:23.964 --> 41:25.137
- Come on!
- Come on, come on, come on!

41:25.206 --> 41:26.622
Come on, come on!
- Come on!

41:26.691 --> 41:29.728
Yeah, motherfucker!
- Woo!

41:29.797 --> 41:30.729
- That is huge.

41:30.798 --> 41:32.317
- That' a Yellerstone horse?

41:32.386 --> 41:33.698
- For hell's sakes,
the last three

41:33.767 --> 41:35.044
have been Yellowstone horses.

41:35.113 --> 41:36.770
- Look, it's
not Yellerstone.

41:36.839 --> 41:38.530
It's Yellowstone.

41:38.599 --> 41:40.981
- Whatever you say, baby,
just take your pants off.

41:41.050 --> 41:42.638
- Other room.

41:42.707 --> 41:44.053
You can take your pants off
in the other room.

41:44.122 --> 41:45.986
- I don't know why we're
talking about that

41:46.055 --> 41:47.815
when we're watching a horse.
Doesn't even make any sense.

41:51.854 --> 41:53.027
- I gotta get up.

42:02.968 --> 42:04.694
- I don't know shit about 'em.

42:07.628 --> 42:10.010
The guy at the store said
it's a good one.

42:44.596 --> 42:48.945
- Well... hell of a lot better'n
the one you fuckin' tore up.

42:49.014 --> 42:50.360
That's for sure.

42:50.429 --> 42:51.638
- As it should be.

43:06.998 --> 43:08.206
- It sounds nice.

43:13.487 --> 43:14.833
Anything you'd like to hear?

43:16.870 --> 43:18.768
- Hell, I don't know.

43:20.805 --> 43:21.771
Just play me one.

43:24.049 --> 43:26.396
- Hey, boss.
You need a beer.

43:26.465 --> 43:28.088
- Thanks, Jake.

43:31.539 --> 43:32.955

- Sir, after lunch
we could bring in

45:35.698 --> 45:37.010
them replacements heifers.

45:37.079 --> 45:39.081
The vet wants to preg-check
them tomorrow.

45:40.254 --> 45:41.808
- Yeah, you go ahead, uh...

45:47.917 --> 45:49.885
You know, the lodge
is where family belongs.

45:55.304 --> 45:56.926
Didn't sound like
a question, did it?

45:58.997 --> 46:00.240
It's a question.

46:01.931 --> 46:03.312
- Right...

46:03.381 --> 46:04.934
Um...

46:05.003 --> 46:06.798
I mean, are you asking us...

46:06.867 --> 46:08.766
To come live up there with you?
- That's what I'm asking.

46:08.835 --> 46:10.906
- We got that stray kid with us
sir, you don't want that.

46:10.975 --> 46:12.839
- Stray kids is fine.

46:12.908 --> 46:14.288
No stray dogs.

46:14.357 --> 46:16.152
- Shit, you know
I don't like dogs.

46:18.430 --> 46:20.087
- Well, then it's settled.

46:48.150 --> 46:49.151
- You ready?

46:50.704 --> 46:51.809
- Ready as we're gonna get.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.831
Oh, shit.

47:35.093 --> 47:37.061
- Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!

48:33.151 --> 48:34.912
- Woo-hoo!

48:54.276 --> 48:56.036
- Get yourself some
trail cameras

48:56.105 --> 48:57.486
put 'em somewhere
nobody can see them,

48:57.555 --> 48:58.901
and point 'em at this gate.

48:58.970 --> 49:01.455
Someone tries it again,
we'll know who it was.

49:01.524 --> 49:02.940
- Thank you.

49:03.009 --> 49:04.493
- Yeah.

49:18.058 --> 49:19.611
- Now we go find
who let them out.

49:20.785 --> 49:23.201
- Yeah. That's the plan.

49:23.270 --> 49:25.997
- These are little victories,
in the scheme of things.

49:26.066 --> 49:29.000
You'd be surprised
how much they matter.

49:29.069 --> 49:31.278
We rest the little things
on the large things.

49:32.935 --> 49:34.626
Thank you.

49:34.695 --> 49:36.145
- Happy to help.

49:38.458 --> 49:39.631
- Watch out for that one.

49:42.910 --> 49:44.464
- Why, is she trouble?

49:46.569 --> 49:49.296
When they look at you
like that they're all trouble.

50:05.071 --> 50:06.348
- What are you doing?

50:10.007 --> 50:12.009
- I don't know.

50:13.941 --> 50:15.150
- I'm married.

50:16.841 --> 50:18.291
- I noticed.

50:35.308 --> 50:36.654
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

50:38.621 --> 50:42.211
- Yeah, it's how I felt about
my wife first time I saw her.

50:45.111 --> 50:47.009
- It's how I felt
when I first saw you.

50:49.149 --> 50:50.426
My fucking luck.

50:52.670 --> 50:55.569
- Well, it can't be love.

50:57.226 --> 50:58.503
God wouldn't let you
love something

50:58.572 --> 50:59.539
that can't love you back.

51:03.163 --> 51:04.302
- Yeah, he would.

51:28.671 --> 51:31.191
- Governor's asking for you
to meet her in the press room.

51:31.260 --> 51:33.469
- Is there a press conference
scheduled for today?

51:33.538 --> 51:34.643
- Not scheduled.

51:36.921 --> 51:38.336
- Are we doing this now?

52:03.085 --> 52:04.190
- Join us, Jamie.

52:17.203 --> 52:20.309
- Thanks for the flowers.
Meant a whole lot.

52:20.378 --> 52:23.036
- I'm...
I'm surprised you're here.

52:23.105 --> 52:26.350
- We, uh... we wouldn't miss
this for the world.

52:38.155 --> 52:40.571
- Well, as many of you
may have suspected,

52:40.640 --> 52:42.883
I believe that
I can best represent Montana

52:42.952 --> 52:44.989
from the Senate.

52:45.058 --> 52:48.372
The next Governor of
Montana must hold steadfast

52:48.441 --> 52:49.856
to the progress that
we have made,

52:49.925 --> 52:54.067
and yet, never allow
that progress to redefine

52:54.136 --> 52:56.656
what it means
to be a Montanan.

52:56.725 --> 53:00.073
It is my great honor
to introduce you

53:00.142 --> 53:03.110
to my choice as the next

53:05.492 --> 53:06.597
John Dutton.

53:18.436 --> 53:20.300
- John.
- Thank you, Governor.

53:33.417 --> 53:35.281
- You don't see it
on your way to work,

53:35.350 --> 53:38.939
in the fields,
or on the mountain.

53:39.008 --> 53:41.804
But there's a war being
waged against our way of life.

53:41.873 --> 53:44.669
They'll tell you all the reasons
why our way of life...

53:44.738 --> 53:46.913
- This is just the beginning.

53:46.982 --> 53:49.226
...are bad
for this country,

53:49.295 --> 53:50.468
bad for our future.

53:51.918 --> 53:54.369
How it's immoral
that you live here,

53:54.438 --> 53:57.579
work here,
grow their food here.

53:57.648 --> 53:59.650
They will tell it so much
you might even start

53:59.719 --> 54:00.754
to believe it yourself.

54:01.859 --> 54:04.827
Question what you do
and who you are.

54:04.896 --> 54:08.693
They'll tell you that
the land's only hope

54:08.762 --> 54:12.249
is for them to
be its steward.

54:12.318 --> 54:15.113
The ugly truth is
they want the land,

54:15.182 --> 54:17.254
and if they get it,

54:17.323 --> 54:20.153
it will never look
like our land again.

54:20.222 --> 54:22.673
That is progress
in today's terms,

54:22.742 --> 54:27.091
so if it's progress you seek,
do not vote for me.

54:27.160 --> 54:30.612
I am the opposite of progress.

54:30.681 --> 54:32.614
I am the wall
that it bashes against,

54:32.683 --> 54:34.409
and I will not be
the one who breaks.
