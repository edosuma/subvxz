00:19.895 --> 00:21.855
But we just want to make sure.

00:22.272 --> 00:25.317
There was really no need for you to come,
Miss Prince.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.069
Security is a routine matter...

00:28.153 --> 00:30.363
for my well-trained staff.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.867
Well, maybe my country is being
a little overcautious, Colonel.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.869
But we don't want anything to disrupt...

00:35.952 --> 00:38.747
the arrangements being made
for next month's conference.

00:38.830 --> 00:42.083
Now, the peace conference
will be a different matter.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.002
Then I will need your help.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.796
But the Nyerland Embassy guards are...

00:46.880 --> 00:51.343
perfectly capable of protecting
these minor ministers...

00:51.426 --> 00:55.430
who can just barely negotiate
the shape of the conference table.

01:00.810 --> 01:01.936
Thank you.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.063
May I take your picture, please?

01:05.147 --> 01:07.400
If your film is in color, young man...

01:07.484 --> 01:11.112
I must warn you, I photograph in dull gray.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.624
I think you should look at this.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.257
My wife!

01:32.216 --> 01:33.968
She has a message for you.

01:34.927 --> 01:36.429
My wife is dead.

01:36.637 --> 01:38.514
But she's still within reach.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.308
The picture proves it.

01:42.226 --> 01:43.770
I can't believe this.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.563
If you come with me...

01:45.646 --> 01:48.649
I can show you something else
that might convince you.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.574
If you're certain you don't need me
any longer, Colonel Dekker...

01:56.657 --> 01:58.409
I guess I'll head back to the office.

01:58.492 --> 02:00.119
And please tell your superiors...

02:00.202 --> 02:02.872
that I have everything under control.

02:03.247 --> 02:04.957
I'm sure you do.

02:15.384 --> 02:17.303
I really should get back now.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.680
Not until you see these.

02:22.349 --> 02:24.018
My wife again.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.481
This necklace...

02:29.857 --> 02:31.650
the first thing I ever gave her...

02:31.734 --> 02:34.403
destroyed in the fire that killed her.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.530
What kind of magic is this?

02:36.822 --> 02:39.533
I told you, she's trying to get
through to you.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.909
It's not magic.

02:41.118 --> 02:43.495
We'll take you
to where you can talk to her.

02:43.579 --> 02:45.581
I'll explain on the way, okay?

04:56.919 --> 04:59.505
You see, I take pictures, Mr. Secretary.

04:59.839 --> 05:03.634
Only, the pictures I take
are of things from another world.

05:04.927 --> 05:06.220
Remarkable.

05:06.387 --> 05:07.888
It used to scare me.

05:08.222 --> 05:10.016
Like, I'd take a picture...

05:10.349 --> 05:12.601
and extra faces would show up.

05:13.102 --> 05:14.979
Then I discovered...

05:15.062 --> 05:18.607
that if I just held the camera
and thought real hard...

05:18.691 --> 05:20.443
I could make the pictures.

05:20.568 --> 05:22.611
Like these others.

05:22.695 --> 05:24.738
And you say you can...

05:24.905 --> 05:27.324
talk to the spirits you photograph?

05:27.408 --> 05:29.869
No. That's my aunt and uncle. You'll see.

06:24.172 --> 06:25.966
Are you guys crazy?

06:26.133 --> 06:27.926
Just get out of the car, lady.

06:28.010 --> 06:29.344
What's going on?

06:29.469 --> 06:30.554
Get out!

06:33.306 --> 06:35.142
Okay, why are you doing this?

06:35.225 --> 06:36.518
Let's just say...

06:36.601 --> 06:38.395
we don't like women drivers.

06:38.478 --> 06:40.355
That's cute. That's real cute.

06:40.439 --> 06:44.276
We just want to take you off the highway
for a while. Let's go.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.837
Diana Prince, IADC.

07:09.926 --> 07:11.469
You take care of her?

07:11.553 --> 07:12.929
See for yourself.

08:06.023 --> 08:07.608
A psychic photograph?

08:07.692 --> 08:10.236
There's no other way to explain it, Steve.

08:10.319 --> 08:14.073
The woman standing next to Bakru
in that picture is his wife.

08:14.156 --> 08:16.075
She died a year ago in a fire.

08:16.158 --> 08:17.410
This picture's a fake.

08:17.493 --> 08:21.455
Someone took a picture of an old photo
of his wife, then re-exposed the film.

08:21.539 --> 08:24.417
No, the lab boys are positive
it's not a double exposure.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.627
Then some other technique
was used to take it.

08:26.710 --> 08:28.003
No, Steve.

08:28.087 --> 08:29.380
That picture was taken...

08:29.463 --> 08:33.842
with a perfectly normal instant camera,
under perfectly normal conditions.

08:34.051 --> 08:37.554
It's impossible. Because this is not
a perfectly normal picture.

08:38.639 --> 08:39.932
Maybe it isn't.

08:40.015 --> 08:42.183
But it's not an impossibility either.

08:42.268 --> 08:46.230
Now, faces of deceased loved ones
have been showing up in photographs...

08:46.313 --> 08:50.859
next to living people, practically since
photography itself has been invented.

08:50.943 --> 08:52.528
A hundred years or so.

08:54.238 --> 08:57.074
Granted, such photographs are very rare...

08:57.157 --> 08:58.617
but they do exist.

08:58.701 --> 09:00.202
I still say it's a fake.

09:00.285 --> 09:02.246
We find out who's responsible for this...

09:02.329 --> 09:05.916
and we might be able to explain away
100 years of photographic history.

09:05.999 --> 09:09.419
Or we might find someone
with incredible psychic talents.

09:10.629 --> 09:12.339
What about fingerprints?

09:12.422 --> 09:14.758
Ira scanned both sides of the photograph...

09:14.842 --> 09:17.553
but he won't have a readout
till this afternoon.

09:18.971 --> 09:21.056
Says he's booked solid till then.

09:22.307 --> 09:24.101
Humans should be so popular.

09:28.522 --> 09:30.482
By the way, Diana...

09:32.526 --> 09:35.696
Colonel Dekker says
that Bakru's disappearance is your fault.

09:35.779 --> 09:37.030
What?

09:37.114 --> 09:39.741
Come on, Steve. He dismissed me.

09:39.950 --> 09:42.035
Said he had everything under control.

09:42.119 --> 09:44.996
No matter what he says,
I want you back at the Embassy...

09:45.080 --> 09:48.125
to keep an eye on Deputy Minister Kell
and Ambassador Yamura.

09:48.208 --> 09:52.170
Those two plus Bakru are the key figures
in these preliminary talks.

09:52.254 --> 09:54.172
What? You think they're all in danger?

09:54.256 --> 09:58.385
I don't know what to think.
This whole thing is very strange.

10:00.136 --> 10:02.430
You almost said "spooky," didn't you?

10:03.390 --> 10:05.225
Yeah, I guess I did.

10:07.435 --> 10:11.981
My country will never agree to
such a flagrant waste of money!

10:12.899 --> 10:16.236
Our leaders are coming here
to discuss peace...

10:16.486 --> 10:20.949
not to be pampered
and spoon-fed in expensive hotel suites.

10:23.785 --> 10:25.453
Do you think, Ms. Kell...

10:25.537 --> 10:28.957
that the world would take
the talks seriously were they held...

10:29.040 --> 10:32.544
on the back porch of someone's house
in the country?

10:33.545 --> 10:35.797
Please!

10:37.298 --> 10:40.093
Holding the most expensive
talks possible...

10:41.219 --> 10:43.054
hardly insures that they will be...

10:43.137 --> 10:46.849
the most productive talks possible,
Mr. Yamura.

10:50.978 --> 10:52.897
Ladies and gentlemen...

10:52.980 --> 10:54.899
I submit that our talks...

10:54.982 --> 10:57.485
have become something
less than productive.

10:57.652 --> 11:00.822
I believe that an hour's recess
is very much in order.

11:01.155 --> 11:02.949
I understand, as usual...

11:03.032 --> 11:06.118
there are
inexpensive refreshments outside.

11:37.233 --> 11:39.610
- Miss Prince.
- Colonel.

11:39.735 --> 11:41.570
If you still insist...

11:41.862 --> 11:45.074
that you're the one who is to watch
Deputy Minister Kell...

11:45.658 --> 11:48.869
her aide said that
she'd like to talk to you.

11:49.745 --> 11:51.872
Room 110. Down the hall.

11:54.041 --> 11:56.210
Well, thank you, Colonel Dekker.

11:57.544 --> 11:59.588
Don't mention it, Miss Prince.

12:15.229 --> 12:17.105
May I take your picture, ma'am?

12:17.189 --> 12:18.398
Of course.

12:19.149 --> 12:21.485
You remind me so much of my little boy.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.451
- Is this for your school newspaper?
- No, ma'am.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.745
It's for you. From Eric.

12:39.336 --> 12:42.381
He was only 10 years old
when we lost him.

12:43.298 --> 12:44.633
My Eric.

12:46.510 --> 12:49.262
This is Diana Prince. May I come in?

12:59.272 --> 13:03.318
I'm Diana Prince from the IADC.
I was told you wanted to talk to me.

13:05.195 --> 13:06.947
I'll get this for you.

14:15.389 --> 14:18.184
- Welcome, Deputy Minister.
- Hello.

14:18.601 --> 14:22.438
All of us at the Institute
are extremely honored to serve you.

14:22.521 --> 14:23.689
Thank you.

14:23.773 --> 14:25.399
This is my Aunt Theodora.

14:25.483 --> 14:29.028
She and my Uncle Lawson will arrange it
so that you can talk to Eric.

14:29.111 --> 14:30.529
And Matthew here...

14:30.613 --> 14:35.034
as you've probably guessed,
is one of the world's most gifted psychics.

14:35.618 --> 14:40.498
We are here only so he can perfect
his extraordinary powers.

14:40.998 --> 14:43.918
Matthew tells me
that Secretary Bakru is here.

14:44.335 --> 14:46.420
But I'm in a confusion as to why.

14:46.629 --> 14:49.590
Spirits close to both of you
on the other side are...

14:49.882 --> 14:53.552
very eager to speak to you
about the upcoming peace conference.

14:53.636 --> 14:55.012
Peace conference?

14:55.596 --> 14:57.014
What do they want?

14:57.973 --> 15:01.060
I don't want to risk misinterpreting
their message.

15:01.143 --> 15:02.728
You'll hear it for yourself...

15:02.811 --> 15:05.064
just as soon as
Ambassador Yamura arrives.

15:05.147 --> 15:07.149
Kito Yamura is coming, too?

15:07.983 --> 15:11.403
The message from the other side
is for all three of you.

15:13.989 --> 15:15.616
- Ms. Kell.
- Hello.

15:15.699 --> 15:17.159
Nice seeing you again.

15:17.242 --> 15:19.244
Would you excuse us a moment, please?

15:19.328 --> 15:20.913
- Of course.
- Of course.

15:24.583 --> 15:28.170
You're to get right up to your room.
Your uncle wants to talk to you.

15:28.253 --> 15:29.338
He's mad?

15:29.421 --> 15:33.592
Secretary Bakru says it took three pictures
for you to convince him to come here.

15:33.675 --> 15:36.053
- So?
- You brought home two.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.263
You left the other one somewhere.

15:38.430 --> 15:39.931
What if someone finds it?

15:40.015 --> 15:41.183
I'm sorry.

15:41.350 --> 15:42.768
Tell that to your uncle.

15:42.851 --> 15:44.603
He'll be in directly to see you.

15:44.686 --> 15:45.896
Okay.

15:47.230 --> 15:48.565
Matthew!

15:49.358 --> 15:51.985
Thank you. Thank you very much.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.820
No matter what happens...

15:53.904 --> 15:57.407
you've made me remember that Eric
will never be far from me.

15:57.699 --> 15:59.242
- Sure.
- Thank you.

15:59.451 --> 16:01.161
Why don't we all sit down?

16:34.277 --> 16:35.570
Hi, Rover.

16:37.238 --> 16:40.867
Hey, I'm sorry, I don't have time
to discuss the high cost of postage.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.952
If you'll excuse me.

16:43.745 --> 16:45.496
Hey, come on. Settle down.

16:46.998 --> 16:48.750
You're dropping your mail.

16:50.293 --> 16:54.380
If you're not careful, you'll be back
delivering the morning coffee, darling.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.175
Hi.

16:57.258 --> 16:59.927
Sorry, I was trying to get over here,
but the Rover-

17:00.011 --> 17:02.680
It's all right, Diana.
Won't you please come in?

17:03.848 --> 17:05.683
How do you do, Miss Prince?

17:05.808 --> 17:07.393
Hello, Colonel Dekker.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.229
Thanks for trying.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.907
Agent Markowitz is on his way over
to the Embassy.

17:22.157 --> 17:26.162
Which means you no longer need to worry
about the peace-talk negotiations.

17:27.538 --> 17:32.001
Steve, I'm perfectly capable of finding out
who abducted those two diplomats.

17:33.794 --> 17:35.713
On your last assignment...

17:35.796 --> 17:39.300
you were found sleeping serenely
on a backroom couch...

17:39.383 --> 17:42.553
while supposedly
watching Deputy Minister Kell...

17:42.636 --> 17:44.096
who disappeared.

17:44.221 --> 17:46.223
Somebody lured me into that room...

17:46.307 --> 17:49.643
and chloroformed me to get me
out of the way and you know it.

17:49.727 --> 17:50.811
No.

17:50.895 --> 17:53.439
There was no odor of gas in that room.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.441
There was only you.

17:55.566 --> 17:59.236
Whatever you were sleeping off
wasn't chloroform.

18:07.703 --> 18:10.331
Steve, am I on this case or aren't I?

18:11.040 --> 18:14.418
Diana, we've all been anxious for you
to take a little leave time.

18:14.501 --> 18:16.462
- You've really been working hard-
- I see.

18:16.545 --> 18:18.922
Why don't you fly to Florida
and get a little sun?

18:19.006 --> 18:20.632
You can sail, you can scuba dive-

18:20.716 --> 18:23.093
Not until I find out how
that picture was taken...

18:23.177 --> 18:24.511
who's got Bakru and Kell...

18:24.595 --> 18:26.638
and who's trying to get me out of the way!

18:26.722 --> 18:27.890
I'll tell you what.

18:27.973 --> 18:30.601
Leave the name of the hotel
where you'll be staying...

18:30.684 --> 18:32.811
and we'll let you know
the minute we find out.

18:32.895 --> 18:35.105
You're not going to let him
get away with this.

18:35.189 --> 18:38.442
If it wasn't for his lax security,
this never would have happened.

18:38.525 --> 18:40.819
Diana, I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands.

18:40.903 --> 18:43.447
Go on. Have fun. Get a good tan.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.741
Read a couple of good books.

18:47.784 --> 18:49.536
"Don't call us, Diana.

18:50.412 --> 18:51.705
"We'll call you. "

18:51.788 --> 18:53.915
The minute we have some good news.

18:56.126 --> 19:00.338
Well, with him in charge,
I won't hold my breath.

19:15.312 --> 19:16.980
Nicely done, Major.

19:17.856 --> 19:22.152
And I assure you it's all for the better.

19:22.569 --> 19:26.865
You just prove to me that
you're as good at doing your job, Colonel...

19:26.948 --> 19:29.325
as you are at going over people's heads.

19:41.671 --> 19:42.839
There.

19:49.137 --> 19:52.056
Hi, Uncle Lawson. Sorry I lost the picture.

19:52.140 --> 19:53.641
You should be, Matthew.

19:53.725 --> 19:57.061
If anyone uninvited found out
where you are and what you can do...

19:57.145 --> 19:59.314
we'd never, any of us,
have a moment's peace.

19:59.397 --> 20:01.274
Look at this one I just did.

20:05.028 --> 20:06.362
That's very good.

20:06.863 --> 20:09.032
My coaching is making it easier, isn't it?

20:09.115 --> 20:10.241
I guess so.

20:10.324 --> 20:13.411
- Is it lunchtime yet?
- They're sending up something now.

20:13.494 --> 20:15.621
I kind of wanted to eat downstairs.

20:15.705 --> 20:17.290
I like that Ms. Kell.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.212
Unfortunately, someone with your talent
doesn't always have time for socializing.

20:23.296 --> 20:25.381
- I thought you understood that.
- Yeah.

20:25.464 --> 20:28.759
Are we gonna have to move again
after these people leave?

20:29.051 --> 20:33.097
Well, Matthew, the people who require
our services, unfortunately...

20:33.180 --> 20:35.808
can't always come to us.
We have to go to them.

20:36.475 --> 20:39.020
But you like traveling and adventure,
don't you?

20:39.103 --> 20:41.147
All boys should be as lucky as you, huh?

20:41.230 --> 20:42.481
I guess.

21:19.435 --> 21:20.561
Hello, Ira.

21:20.644 --> 21:24.732
I'd like a readout on the fingerprints
you found on that photo this morning.

21:28.694 --> 21:31.363
Who is addressing the Irac computer?

21:32.197 --> 21:34.658
It's Diana Prince. You know my voice, Ira.

21:34.783 --> 21:39.037
Diana Prince is no longer authorized
to receive official data.

21:40.289 --> 21:41.582
What?

21:41.665 --> 21:42.791
Since when?

21:42.875 --> 21:46.878
Clearance was withdrawn
five minutes ago by Major Trevor.

21:49.131 --> 21:52.384
What's a little red tape among friends, Ira?

21:52.592 --> 21:56.013
Give me the readout on the fingerprints.
I know you found something.

21:56.096 --> 21:57.264
You always do.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.141
Flattery will get you nowhere.

21:59.224 --> 22:00.517
Ira.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.102
My hands are tied.

22:03.061 --> 22:04.771
That was cute.

22:05.230 --> 22:09.484
My programming disallows telling
Diana Prince about the boy.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.528
What boy?

22:11.695 --> 22:15.574
Adopted name: Koslo, Matthew R.

22:15.907 --> 22:19.369
Passport thumbprint matches one
found on photograph.

22:19.870 --> 22:23.331
I thought I saw a boy
getting into that car with Bakru.

22:23.582 --> 22:26.251
Other prints belong to the Secretary.

22:26.501 --> 22:28.503
Where can I find Matthew Koslo?

22:28.628 --> 22:32.549
Even if that information were contained
in the Irac computer...

22:32.632 --> 22:35.093
it would not be available to Diana Prince.

22:36.011 --> 22:39.180
Anything else that's unavailable
to Diana Prince?

22:39.639 --> 22:42.767
That the boy reputedly
has psychic powers is a fact...

22:42.851 --> 22:45.311
also to be withheld from Diana Prince...

22:46.438 --> 22:49.190
who now has five seconds
to leave the premises...

22:49.274 --> 22:51.151
before an alarm is activated.

22:51.526 --> 22:53.027
Five, four...

22:53.403 --> 22:55.238
Okay, I'm going.

22:55.446 --> 22:56.906
...three, two...

22:56.990 --> 22:58.157
Hang on.

22:58.825 --> 23:00.493
Thank you, Ira, forever.

23:00.577 --> 23:02.412
...two and one-quarter...

23:03.788 --> 23:07.709
Major Trevor said nothing about clearance
for Wonder Woman.

23:10.086 --> 23:12.839
And you ha ve three seconds, Rover.

23:14.632 --> 23:17.719
Three, two, one.

23:20.388 --> 23:22.223
And a good day to you, sir.

23:23.266 --> 23:26.018
That was an official
of the Tymanian government.

23:26.102 --> 23:29.063
Our efforts here will be rewarded
by the end of next week.

23:29.147 --> 23:30.439
No sooner?

23:31.023 --> 23:33.943
I don't like the idea of having
to stay around so long.

23:34.026 --> 23:37.530
Well, our client has a perfect right
to be completely satisfied...

23:37.613 --> 23:40.074
that the peace conference
will be canceled...

23:40.157 --> 23:43.119
thereby assuring the continuance
of the border wars.

23:44.120 --> 23:47.248
Now, Tymania assures itself that...

23:47.373 --> 23:51.043
by the end of next month, they'll invade
their war-weakened neighbors...

23:51.127 --> 23:53.629
whereupon we collect a tidy bonus.

23:54.088 --> 23:57.258
This is the riskiest con
we've ever undertaken.

23:57.341 --> 23:59.760
Yes, and the most profitable.

24:00.678 --> 24:03.264
Our nephew should be finished
with his lunch by now.

24:03.347 --> 24:06.517
Why don't you get him ready
for the final photography session?

24:06.600 --> 24:08.686
Then set things up for the séance.

24:08.769 --> 24:10.145
We're to hold it tonight?

24:10.229 --> 24:12.314
Ambassador Yamura will be here
this evening.

24:12.398 --> 24:14.483
I don't see any reason to postpone,
do you?

24:14.567 --> 24:17.027
The IADC agent, Diana Prince.

24:17.111 --> 24:19.280
Word is she's been kicked off the case.

24:19.363 --> 24:21.282
I still don't like it, Lawson.

24:21.657 --> 24:22.950
Nor do I.

24:23.951 --> 24:27.287
Therefore, Charles, have your men
see to it that Miss Prince...

24:27.371 --> 24:30.708
is, once and for all,
taken out of the picture.

24:46.640 --> 24:47.808
Finished up?

24:48.517 --> 24:50.894
She turns the key. Boom!

24:50.978 --> 24:52.479
Grab your tools.

25:51.955 --> 25:53.581
All right, gentlemen...

25:54.415 --> 25:58.837
how about a rousing chorus of
who hired you and where I can find him.

26:20.233 --> 26:21.401
Go back.

26:21.484 --> 26:23.403
- Go back, Diana Prince.
- Escape.

26:23.486 --> 26:25.113
- Go back.
- Head for help.

26:26.572 --> 26:28.074
Escape while you can.

26:46.217 --> 26:47.677
Whatever you are...

26:47.760 --> 26:51.013
mortal or otherwise,
I challenge you to show yourself.

27:02.108 --> 27:04.026
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

27:04.276 --> 27:06.278
Mr. Secretary, would you like some more?

27:06.362 --> 27:07.988
- Yes, please.
- There you go.

27:08.072 --> 27:10.533
Just a little something to tide you over.

27:10.908 --> 27:14.036
It won't be much longer until the séance.

27:14.119 --> 27:16.872
Ambassador Yamura should be arriving
any moment.

27:19.375 --> 27:22.044
Perhaps that's him now. Excuse me.

27:31.261 --> 27:32.429
Who are you?

27:32.513 --> 27:35.182
Carol Littleton. I came to see Matthew.

27:35.849 --> 27:37.059
Matthew?

27:37.142 --> 27:40.771
Yes, I understand that he has connections
with people on the other side.

27:40.854 --> 27:42.981
And I must speak to my late husband.

27:43.065 --> 27:44.900
Who told you Matthew was here?

27:44.983 --> 27:46.485
My dear woman...

27:46.902 --> 27:51.240
money not only talks,
it makes others talk as well.

27:51.990 --> 27:54.368
I'm afraid I cannot let you see my nephew.

27:54.451 --> 27:58.538
Not even for a rather large donation
to your institution?

27:59.831 --> 28:01.708
It's out of the question.

28:01.792 --> 28:02.960
Please, leave at once.

28:03.043 --> 28:05.629
Excuse me, isn't that
Deputy Minister Kell?

28:05.712 --> 28:07.673
She's the one that's missing, isn't it?

28:07.756 --> 28:09.383
I think you're mistaken.

28:09.466 --> 28:10.717
I think not.

28:11.218 --> 28:13.387
Her picture is on all the newscasts.

28:14.054 --> 28:15.680
What's she doing here?

28:17.182 --> 28:20.060
She's here on a mission
of grave importance.

28:20.310 --> 28:23.188
And that's Secretary Bakru, isn't it?

28:24.648 --> 28:27.901
They both have business
with those who have passed on.

28:28.652 --> 28:31.613
Something the news media
would not understand.

28:32.072 --> 28:34.908
But would love to hear about,
I should think.

28:39.079 --> 28:41.331
All right, young lady, I think that-

28:41.414 --> 28:42.791
Carol Littleton.

28:43.833 --> 28:47.754
Perhaps we can arrange for you
to meet with Matthew...

28:48.088 --> 28:50.256
and the spirit of your late husband.

28:51.299 --> 28:52.842
Oh, yes, Jason.

28:55.178 --> 28:57.722
Dearly departed, wealthy Jason.

28:58.014 --> 29:00.099
We'll talk more about that later.

29:01.351 --> 29:04.938
Dee, please show Miss Littleton
to the room at the top of the stairs.

29:05.021 --> 29:06.105
Thank you.

29:08.691 --> 29:11.945
And you are not to leave that room
until you are summoned.

29:13.279 --> 29:14.948
I do hope...

29:15.615 --> 29:20.495
your Matthew can have a little more luck
than the others I've tried.

29:20.787 --> 29:23.039
Imagine neglecting to tell...

29:23.748 --> 29:28.461
his wife, before he died, where he left
$500,000 worth of diamonds.

29:30.338 --> 29:32.173
- Really?
- Really.

29:43.142 --> 29:44.769
Are you insane?

29:45.978 --> 29:49.774
If I had let her leave, she would have gone
straight to the newspapers.

29:50.650 --> 29:53.069
We can always dispose of her
after the séance.

29:53.152 --> 29:56.364
How did the widow get past
our bag of tricks down the road?

29:56.447 --> 29:58.115
What should I do? Ask her?

29:58.199 --> 30:01.327
No, I'll take care of it.
You've made too many mistakes.

30:13.297 --> 30:14.507
Eve...

30:15.841 --> 30:17.635
Every 5,000 miles.

30:20.054 --> 30:21.764
Come in the office, Eve.

30:25.351 --> 30:28.062
I hope you weren't planning
on going anywhere, Eve.

30:28.145 --> 30:31.190
I hope you weren't either.
Markowitz just called.

30:31.273 --> 30:34.401
Don't tell me. Somebody else
is missing from the negotiations.

30:34.485 --> 30:35.694
Ambassador Yamura.

30:35.778 --> 30:37.321
Gone without a trace.

30:38.197 --> 30:41.158
Well, at least we have some idea
who's behind all this.

30:41.241 --> 30:42.659
Ira came up with a name?

30:42.743 --> 30:46.914
He came up with one: Matthew Koslo.
I came up with another: Lawson Koslo.

30:46.997 --> 30:48.373
Never heard of either one.

30:48.457 --> 30:50.584
I had to pry the second one
out of someone...

30:50.667 --> 30:53.212
at the leading psychic research center
in New York.

30:53.295 --> 30:55.714
They don't like to talk about him
very much.

30:55.797 --> 31:00.594
Seems he's been successful at using
very legitimate psychic phenomena...

31:00.969 --> 31:03.055
in very illegitimate con games.

31:03.138 --> 31:05.557
You think the people
who are disappearing from...

31:05.641 --> 31:07.768
the peace conference talks
have been conned?

31:07.851 --> 31:09.686
It could be. See...

31:09.853 --> 31:13.690
Lawson Koslo became the legal guardian
of a boy 10 years ago.

31:13.857 --> 31:18.320
That boy, Matthew,
can make psychic photographs.

31:19.071 --> 31:21.531
- The one Diana found?
- Yeah. It all fits.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.784
Let's see if Diana's still in town.

31:23.867 --> 31:27.245
Don't bother, I tried
right after Markowitz called. No answer.

31:28.288 --> 31:32.417
Yeah, by this time, she's probably
checking in to some hotel on Miami Beach.

31:34.377 --> 31:36.087
You want me to go get her?

31:37.547 --> 31:39.257
Go finish your lube job.

32:19.881 --> 32:22.008
Welcome, Ambassador Yamura.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.595
Your associates have been
anxiously awaiting you.

32:25.678 --> 32:28.848
My curiosity has been aroused, Madam,
and that's all.

32:29.432 --> 32:32.602
You won't find me as gullible
as my associates.

32:32.685 --> 32:35.480
Curiosity is but a stepping stone
to the truth...

32:35.938 --> 32:38.274
as you'll soon discover for yourself.

32:39.275 --> 32:42.361
Charles, perhaps the Ambassador
would like some coffee?

32:43.613 --> 32:44.780
Mr. Yamura.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.285
You have all the pictures this time?

32:49.368 --> 32:51.287
He has them all. I made sure.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.789
- Go upstairs and take a nap.
- I don't need a nap.

32:53.873 --> 32:55.124
The séance is at midnight.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.044
It wouldn't do for you to nod off
in front of our guests.

32:58.127 --> 32:59.295
I won't nod off.

32:59.378 --> 33:02.089
I want to talk to these people.
I like company.

33:02.423 --> 33:04.300
Get upstairs.

33:33.996 --> 33:35.122
Matthew?

33:41.962 --> 33:44.340
You don't look like your picture, lady.

33:49.553 --> 33:52.014
Bet you don't look like this one either.

33:52.848 --> 33:54.600
Who are you, anyhow?

33:56.018 --> 33:59.688
Matthew, now listen to me.
I want you to believe me.

34:00.063 --> 34:02.983
- You don't want to hurt anyone, right?
- No, of course not.

34:03.066 --> 34:05.694
Me and my Uncle Lawson help people,
with my camera.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.362
Yes, I know. You are a very special boy.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.574
I know that. Come over here and sit down.

34:15.536 --> 34:19.123
Now, your uncle
is using you to hurt people.

34:19.206 --> 34:22.002
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

34:22.377 --> 34:23.837
He cons them.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.339
He uses what you can do...

34:26.422 --> 34:29.301
to make them believe and hear
everything he tells them.

34:29.384 --> 34:30.844
I don't believe that.

34:30.927 --> 34:33.722
- You're the one that's lying.
- No. I'm not.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.516
Two men told me that.
Two men who tried to kill me.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.562
Your uncle does have two men besides
the driver working for him, doesn't he?

34:40.645 --> 34:42.355
Yeah. Pete and Larry.

34:42.438 --> 34:45.525
They went out this afternoon,
but they haven't come back yet.

34:45.609 --> 34:48.360
Yes, I know.
And they're not going to. Because...

34:48.445 --> 34:50.697
Well, I had to tie them up...

34:50.780 --> 34:53.574
so I could get here
and find out what's happening.

34:54.451 --> 34:56.244
Are you a cop or something?

34:56.870 --> 34:58.038
No.

35:00.123 --> 35:02.667
I'm a government agent.
That's why I'm here.

35:03.334 --> 35:05.879
Your uncle wants to make
those people downstairs...

35:05.962 --> 35:09.424
tell the leaders of their countries
to do something very wrong.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.759
I don't know if I should believe you.

35:14.429 --> 35:16.222
Think about it, Matthew.

35:16.723 --> 35:19.767
But just don't tell anyone
what I've told you. Promise?

35:20.018 --> 35:21.102
I don't know.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.854
You don't look like your picture.

35:22.937 --> 35:25.064
Matt, I know I don't.

35:25.148 --> 35:27.358
Just think about it, okay?

35:27.442 --> 35:28.610
Matt.

35:28.693 --> 35:31.612
I like to be called Matt.
How did you know?

35:41.873 --> 35:45.126
Why aren't you in your room resting,
as your aunt told you to?

35:45.209 --> 35:46.544
I was just going.

35:46.919 --> 35:49.297
Were you in there talking to that lady?

35:49.589 --> 35:51.674
Is she going to be at the séance?

35:52.550 --> 35:56.137
Maybe. Unless there's some reason
why she shouldn't be.

36:18.117 --> 36:20.286
Did you take
that woman's picture, Matthew?

36:20.369 --> 36:21.454
Yeah.

36:21.537 --> 36:24.457
And you saw something
that disturbed you?

36:33.674 --> 36:37.428
Your Aunt Theodora and I have taken
great pains to raise you, you know.

36:37.511 --> 36:40.472
We've given you much more
than most parented children have.

36:40.556 --> 36:42.641
Showed you the world three times over...

36:42.725 --> 36:44.601
helped you develop your powers.

36:44.685 --> 36:45.978
I know.

36:47.479 --> 36:49.940
All we ask is that you be honest with us.

36:54.695 --> 36:56.071
Did you hear me?

36:58.031 --> 37:01.994
That lady in there,
she doesn't look anything like her picture.

37:02.077 --> 37:04.163
You mean, she's wearing a disguise?

37:06.248 --> 37:09.001
Maybe she has some business
I can help her with.

37:09.418 --> 37:11.003
- Uncle Lawson?
- Yes?

37:11.837 --> 37:15.340
You don't con people, do you?
You don't lie?

37:17.301 --> 37:20.637
Matthew, you've seen
what I can do through the spirits.

37:21.346 --> 37:23.807
And spirits cannot tolerate liars.

37:25.267 --> 37:26.643
You get some rest.

37:45.662 --> 37:47.205
Diana.

39:08.911 --> 39:10.288
You see?

39:10.371 --> 39:12.123
I told you, you needed a nap.

39:12.206 --> 39:14.709
I just had my eyes closed. I was thinking.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.544
Sure you were, young man.

39:16.627 --> 39:19.463
Come on. It's almost midnight.
Let's go downstairs.

39:19.797 --> 39:22.007
I don't want to take part in the séance.

39:22.091 --> 39:23.634
Don't be ridiculous.

39:23.968 --> 39:26.637
I'll stay up here. You don't really need me.

39:26.971 --> 39:28.764
Of course we need you.

39:28.931 --> 39:30.975
All I do is take pictures.

39:31.058 --> 39:34.520
I don't have anything to do
with all that other stuff that happens.

39:34.603 --> 39:36.021
You certainly do.

39:36.814 --> 39:38.315
If only because...

39:38.816 --> 39:41.944
the people and the spirits
are comforted by your presence.

39:42.027 --> 39:43.404
I'll stay here.

39:44.363 --> 39:47.283
Put this on. You are coming downstairs
with me right now.

39:47.366 --> 39:48.575
No, I'm not.

39:48.659 --> 39:51.495
Perhaps you'd like to speak to
Charles about it?

39:51.704 --> 39:53.831
He's always been able to convince you.

39:53.914 --> 39:55.874
You're just using me to trick people.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.836
- Who told you that?
- That lady.

39:58.919 --> 40:01.338
That lady was a liar and a meddler.

40:01.839 --> 40:04.675
You shouldn't let her
put such ideas into your head.

40:04.758 --> 40:07.678
A complete stranger
forces her way into our house...

40:07.886 --> 40:10.931
and you're so stupid, you believe
everything she says?

40:12.766 --> 40:14.309
Now come on, Matthew.

40:22.526 --> 40:24.987
And now we must all join hands.

40:29.741 --> 40:33.412
My father did not believe in ghosts,
and neither do I.

40:33.537 --> 40:36.123
Your father knew no more than you do.

40:36.206 --> 40:38.917
But he has since learned, as you will.

40:39.709 --> 40:41.169
Please, your hand.

40:45.132 --> 40:47.634
And now, we must close our eyes...

40:47.843 --> 40:52.138
and concentrate on the loved ones
Matthew has helped bring back to us.

41:22.585 --> 41:24.045
Mother.

41:25.171 --> 41:26.422
Over here.

41:26.506 --> 41:28.258
Let's play hide and seek.

41:28.716 --> 41:30.051
Mother?

41:30.134 --> 41:31.511
Can you hear me?

41:31.844 --> 41:34.847
Wait for me, Mother. I wanna talk.

41:35.306 --> 41:36.599
Mother.

41:36.891 --> 41:38.851
Please listen, Mother.

41:38.935 --> 41:41.020
- Eric?
- I wanna talk.

41:41.479 --> 41:43.064
I ha ve to talk.

41:43.731 --> 41:45.233
They tell me I must.

41:45.566 --> 41:47.610
Eric, I can hear you.

41:47.860 --> 41:49.904
Mother? Over here.

41:50.363 --> 41:51.572
Mother?

41:52.240 --> 41:54.659
Eric! It is Eric.

41:55.159 --> 41:56.744
Please listen.

41:57.245 --> 41:59.747
Mother. Can you hear me?

41:59.831 --> 42:01.916
Yes, I can hear you, my darling.

42:01.999 --> 42:06.921
The wars must go on.
Please, Mother. Please listen.

42:07.004 --> 42:10.633
No! It can't be done, Eric. Why?

42:11.175 --> 42:13.844
The time for peace has not yet come.

42:14.428 --> 42:15.596
Atma!

42:15.680 --> 42:19.976
Return to our country, husband.
Your business is there.

42:20.059 --> 42:22.937
This is an outrage! Thousands have died.

42:23.020 --> 42:24.814
Thousands will continue to die...

42:24.897 --> 42:26.982
unless those wars are ended!

42:27.066 --> 42:30.361
Still my rebellious and foolish son.

42:33.906 --> 42:35.866
I haven't heard those words since I-

42:35.950 --> 42:37.868
You'll hear them through eternity...

42:37.952 --> 42:42.289
if you do not do your part in ending
the peace negotiations.

42:42.373 --> 42:44.667
I thought I was free of your tyranny.

42:45.042 --> 42:49.171
You must obey.
Cancel the peace conference.

42:49.255 --> 42:50.464
No!

42:50.547 --> 42:52.007
Please obey, Mother.

42:52.508 --> 42:54.134
The wars must continue.

44:42.033 --> 44:43.117
Get her!

44:58.841 --> 45:00.885
I knew you were tricking people.

45:09.268 --> 45:11.187
I didn't know you could do that.

45:11.270 --> 45:12.855
You never bothered to ask me.

45:12.939 --> 45:16.275
Telekinesis. I've had it
ever since I can remember.

45:18.110 --> 45:22.698
It was all a hoax,
to make us cancel the peace conference!

45:22.782 --> 45:25.534
No doubt they were hired
by a country who'd profit...

45:25.618 --> 45:27.953
by the continuation of the border wars.

45:28.037 --> 45:29.747
Which country was it?

45:30.873 --> 45:32.124
Tymania.

45:32.666 --> 45:34.710
They planned to invade
Parmalec and Disan...

45:34.794 --> 45:37.296
after those countries were
sufficiently weakened...

45:37.379 --> 45:38.881
by the border wars.

45:38.964 --> 45:42.676
Well, fortunately for the world,
you have just pulled your last hoax.

45:46.138 --> 45:47.598
And thank you, Matt...

45:47.681 --> 45:49.016
for all your help.

45:49.099 --> 45:53.312
Yeah, but they did something with that
lady agent. You'd better check downstairs.

45:53.395 --> 45:55.522
I already have and she's just fine.

45:55.606 --> 45:57.691
Guess we make a pretty good team.

45:59.652 --> 46:01.195
What do you think...

46:01.445 --> 46:03.155
Uncle Lawson?

46:20.881 --> 46:25.093
Abilities like Matthew's might
come in very handy in our line of work.

46:25.177 --> 46:27.012
That's true. Ira agrees.

46:27.095 --> 46:30.682
In fact, he's becoming a little insecure
about his job. Look at this.

46:30.766 --> 46:33.268
I got a four-page printout
this morning, entitled:

46:33.352 --> 46:36.855
"Dependable Printed Circuitry versus
Inexplicable Phenomena. "

46:36.939 --> 46:38.690
Do you believe that?

46:38.774 --> 46:40.233
He's too much.

46:40.567 --> 46:42.694
Now, about your punishment.

46:43.695 --> 46:45.113
- Punishment?
- That's right.

46:45.197 --> 46:48.283
For staying on an assignment
after specific orders not to.

46:48.366 --> 46:52.079
Steve, I had to prove that Colonel Dekker
lied about me, and you know it.

46:52.162 --> 46:53.955
Colonel Dekker is now Private Dekker.

46:54.039 --> 46:56.249
But as far as your punishment
is concerned...

46:56.333 --> 46:59.628
I'm sorry, Diana,
but I'm going to have to insist...

47:05.175 --> 47:06.843
that you take a real vacation.

47:06.927 --> 47:11.097
Plane tickets, hotel reservations, specific
orders to have the time of your life.

47:11.181 --> 47:13.350
- Steve, I don't wanna go.
- Go!

47:15.268 --> 47:18.980
There's no suntan lotion in here,
and I burn very badly.

47:26.696 --> 47:28.198
I haven't anything to read.

47:28.281 --> 47:29.866
- No books?
- No books.

47:34.537 --> 47:36.372
No film for my camera.

47:40.877 --> 47:42.295
Cute.

47:43.713 --> 47:45.506
Well, you wanna go with me?

48:36.057 --> 48:37.099
