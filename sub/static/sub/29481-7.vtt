as well as yours,

00:29.420 --> 00:32.641
I hope every donor and friend
of the university

00:32.684 --> 00:36.949
in this room tonight
will support me in that belief.

I'll be sending a check
to the university tomorrow.

00:56.882 --> 00:59.450
How does 5 million sound?

00:59.494 --> 01:01.235
- That's very generous, Ravi.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.758
But that doesn't
change anything.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.499
- And of course not.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.762
We just want to keep the lines
of communication open.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.242

- Adams.

Good news is, we secured
the scene pretty fast.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.245
Based on
the ejected shell casings,

04:05.288 --> 04:07.595
the murder weapon
is a 9-millimeter pistol.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.296
- Looks like the gunpowder
burned through the clothing.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.517
Means the muzzle was less
than two feet away?

04:18.388 --> 04:20.521
Killer was face-to-face
with Cabot when he fired.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.959
- Shot at close range twice,
and nothing taken.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.222
- You got some witnesses
being held back at the hall?

04:26.266 --> 04:29.181
- Yeah, my guys did
some preliminary interviews.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.445
They've identified the ones who
had contact with the victim

04:31.488 --> 04:33.098
or who can confirm
the timeline.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.405

to speak with all of them.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.450
- Yeah.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.410
- You called 911 at 8:07 p.m.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.933
Is that when you heard
the shots?

04:41.977 --> 04:44.936
- Yeah, I stepped outside
to dump the trash.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.851
Next thing I know,
I hear someone yelling

04:46.895 --> 04:51.595
something like, "No, don't."
And then I hear this pop, pop.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.118
We've been trained
about what to do

04:53.162 --> 04:54.642

an active shooter on campus,

04:54.685 --> 04:56.644
so I immediately called 911.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.429
- See or hear anything
after the shots were fired?

04:59.473 --> 05:02.302
- No, I'm not like you guys.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.348

not towards it.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.958
- You were the first on scene?

05:07.002 --> 05:08.699
- Yeah, couldn't have been
more than a minute or two

05:08.743 --> 05:10.092
after it happened.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.354
- Did you see anyone
running away?

05:11.398 --> 05:12.790
- No, and believe me,
we looked.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.705
Cabot was one of ours.
He was a good guy.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.490
He always took time to say hi

05:16.533 --> 05:18.448
or, you know,
ask you how you were doing.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.928
- Did you talk to him
at the event?

05:19.971 --> 05:21.973
- Yeah, for a few minutes
when he was leaving.

05:22.017 --> 05:22.974
- How'd he seem?

05:23.018 --> 05:24.846
- A bit distracted,

05:24.889 --> 05:26.456
like there was something
on his mind.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.198
- Hm.
Did he say anything specific?

05:29.241 --> 05:31.548
- No, just seemed off.

05:31.592 --> 05:32.723
- I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong,

05:32.767 --> 05:34.334
but that's a feeling I got.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.988
- You happen to notice
anyone following him?

05:37.032 --> 05:39.121
- No, he was all alone.

05:39.164 --> 05:42.603
And about five minutes later,
I heard the gunshots.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.086
- I know this is really hard.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.567
But anything you say
can really help us.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.787
- Okay, whatever you need.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.529
I just want whoever did this
to be caught.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.921
- Can you think of any reason

05:56.965 --> 05:58.401
that anyone would wanna
hurt your husband?

05:58.445 --> 05:59.794
- No.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.709
Not at all.

Everybody loved him.

any people following you

06:18.247 --> 06:21.206
or strange cars parked
near the house?

06:21.250 --> 06:23.687
- No, nothing like that.

06:24.993 --> 06:28.083
But there was something
earlier today.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.998
A man came to the house,

06:30.041 --> 06:32.392
banging on the door,
ringing the doorbell.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.612
He was shouting for Robert,
making a scene.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.788
I almost dialed 911.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.442
- Was your husband home?

06:39.486 --> 06:43.707
- No, I was alone,
so of course I didn't open it.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.317
To be honest,
when I saw him

06:45.361 --> 06:47.450
on the video screen,
he scared me.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.105
- Your doorbell has
video capability?

06:50.148 --> 06:52.455
- Yes.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.766
- Did a facial recognition scan
from the doorbell footage

06:58.809 --> 07:00.507
and compared it to
the student ID database.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.857
His name is Luke Wagner,

07:02.900 --> 07:06.121
19 years old, a freshman
at Armstrong University.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.689
- What do we know about him?
Any past run-ins with the law?

07:08.732 --> 07:11.256
- None that I could find,
but his dad, Marc Wagner,

07:11.300 --> 07:13.520
is the subject of
a federal fraud investigation.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.304
- Really?
We know what that's about?

07:15.347 --> 07:17.175
- Not yet.
- Check with White Collar.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.960

Luke was expelled yesterday.
Honor code violation.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.705
- And get this,

07:24.748 --> 07:26.489
Cabot personally handled
the expulsion.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.230
- Well, that would explain
why the kid is angry at him.

a college president

07:29.536 --> 07:31.538

07:48.337 --> 07:50.208
- Oh, not cut out
for the police, huh?

07:50.252 --> 07:54.038
- He's cut out to be a salesman
or a talk show host.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.518
- Wait, what does that mean?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.955

What are you gonna tell

He's family.

but he isn't picking up.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.679
- Not good.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.245
He got kicked out
of school yesterday.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.552
It kind of put him
in a dark place.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.206
- Has he mentioned
Robert Cabot at all?

08:31.249 --> 08:35.166
- Yeah, he was ranting
and raving about him.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.691
You don't think he--
- We don't know yet.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.257
Did he mention
why he got expelled?

08:39.301 --> 08:41.433
- Admissions violation.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.827
Luke had no clue what Cabot
was even talking about.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.438
That's why he was so upset.

08:46.482 --> 08:49.572
Don't blame him;
the guy studies his ass off.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.052
His dad's got a place
in Brooklyn.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.488
Maybe he's over there.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.577
- Okay, thanks.
We'll check it out.

08:54.621 --> 08:55.883
One more thing--

08:55.926 --> 08:57.885
have you ever seen
Luke with a gun?

08:57.928 --> 09:00.409
- Him with a gun?
No.

09:00.452 --> 09:03.194
No way, I'd, like,
totally freak out

09:03.238 --> 09:04.935
if I saw something like that.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.458
Luke's not the kind of guy

09:06.502 --> 09:07.590
who should be carrying
around a weapon.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.070
- What do you mean by that?

09:10.245 --> 09:13.727
- Luke has some...
personality issues.

09:19.646 --> 09:22.562
[dramatic music]

09:22.605 --> 09:24.433
- Antipsychotics.

09:26.522 --> 09:30.526
- He stopped taking them,
like, three days ago, so.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.095
- Okay.
Thank you.

that lying to a federal agent

22:18.380 --> 22:19.425

have to leverage Cabot

24:14.627 --> 24:16.106

to innovation,

overly cautious.

33:11.076 --> 33:14.383

destroy a scanner?

33:14.427 --> 33:18.692

like they're supposed to.
