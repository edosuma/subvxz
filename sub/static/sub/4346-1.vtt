01:52.190 --> 01:53.940
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:55.320 --> 02:01.700
Here ye, here ye, 10 minutes to go
till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.380
Watch it!

02:27.640 --> 02:30.480
<i>- It's a beautiful day
- It's a rather nice day</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:32.810
<i>A day for a glorious wedding</i>

02:32.980 --> 02:35.730
<i>A rehearsal, my dear
To be perfectly clear</i>

02:35.900 --> 02:38.320
<i>A rehearsal for a glorious wedding</i>

02:38.490 --> 02:41.410
<i>Assuming nothing happens
That we don't really know</i>

02:41.570 --> 02:43.990
<i>That nothing unexpected
Interferes with the show</i>

02:44.160 --> 02:46.580
<i>And that's why everything
Every last little thing</i>

02:46.830 --> 02:51.580
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go</i>

02:51.750 --> 02:54.630
<i>- According to plan
- Our son will be married</i>

02:54.790 --> 02:56.921
<i>- According to plan
- Our family carried</i>

02:57.091 --> 03:00.881
<i>Elevated to the heights of society</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:03.681
<i>- To the costume balls
- In the hallowed halls</i>

03:03.851 --> 03:06.011
<i>Rubbing elbows with the finest</i>

03:06.181 --> 03:08.811
<i>Having crumpets with Her Highness</i>

03:09.271 --> 03:11.771
<i>We'll be there, we'll be seen
Having tea with the queen</i>

03:11.941 --> 03:15.611
<i>We'll forget everything
That we've ever, ever been</i>

03:17.611 --> 03:20.941
- Blimey! It's my dress is caught.
- Begging your pardon, ma'am.

03:21.111 --> 03:24.621
- Come on, dear.
- It's not me. It's my dress is caught.

03:24.781 --> 03:27.621
Where is Victor? We might be late.

03:32.581 --> 03:34.501
Fish merchants.

03:34.961 --> 03:37.631
<i>- It's a terrible day
- Now, don't be that way</i>

03:37.801 --> 03:40.341
<i>It's a terrible day for a wedding</i>

03:40.511 --> 03:43.511
<i>It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in</i>

03:43.681 --> 03:46.891
<i>That has led to this ominous wedding</i>

03:47.061 --> 03:49.221
<i>How could our family have come to this?</i>

03:49.891 --> 03:52.391
<i>To marry off our daughter
To the nouveau riche</i>

03:52.561 --> 03:54.061
<i>- They're so common
- So coarse</i>

03:54.231 --> 03:58.021
<i>- Oh, it couldn't be worse
- Couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree</i>

03:58.191 --> 04:00.861
<i>They could be land-rich,
Bankrupt aristocracy</i>

04:01.031 --> 04:02.441
<i>Without a penny to their name</i>

04:02.611 --> 04:05.991
<i>Just like you and me</i>

04:06.161 --> 04:07.951
Oh, dear.

04:08.531 --> 04:11.411
<i>And that's why everything
Every last little thing</i>

04:11.581 --> 04:16.331
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go</i>

04:18.801 --> 04:21.591
<i>- According to plan
- Our daughter will wed</i>

04:21.761 --> 04:24.681
<i>- According to plan
- Our family led</i>

04:24.841 --> 04:29.641
<i>From the depths of deepest poverty</i>

04:30.561 --> 04:33.561
<i>- To the noble realm
- Of our ancestry</i>

04:33.731 --> 04:36.561
<i>And who would have guessed
In a million years</i>

04:36.731 --> 04:39.941
<i>- That our daughter with a face
- Of an otter in disgrace</i>

04:40.111 --> 04:44.651
<i>Would provide our ticket
To a rightful place</i>

04:51.161 --> 04:52.541
Oh, Hildegarde.

04:52.701 --> 04:56.331
What if Victor and I
don't like each other?

04:57.381 --> 04:59.961
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.

05:00.131 --> 05:03.761
Do you suppose your father and I
like each other?

05:03.921 --> 05:05.471
Surely you must a little?

05:06.222 --> 05:07.552
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

05:07.722 --> 05:09.682
Get those corsets laced properly.

05:09.852 --> 05:12.722
I can hear you speak without gasping.

05:19.062 --> 05:21.402
You've certainly hooked a winner
this time, Victor.

05:21.572 --> 05:25.322
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.
- I'm already reeling, Mother.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.612
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot
be marrying a lord or something?

05:28.782 --> 05:32.122
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the Everglots.

05:32.292 --> 05:36.662
I always knew I deserved better
than a fish merchant's life.

05:36.832 --> 05:39.122
But I've never even spoken to her.

05:39.292 --> 05:41.922
Well, at least we have that
in our favor.

05:43.052 --> 05:46.092
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.

05:51.512 --> 05:55.102
Marriage is a partnership,
a little tit for tat.

05:55.602 --> 05:58.022
You'd think a lifetime watching us...

05:58.192 --> 06:00.902
<i>Might have taught her that</i>

06:01.062 --> 06:04.192
<i>- Might have taught her that
- Everything must be perfect</i>

06:04.362 --> 06:07.192
<i>- Everything must be perfect
- Everything must be perfect</i>

06:07.362 --> 06:09.032
<i>Perfect
That's why everything</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:10.612
<i>Every last little thing</i>

06:10.782 --> 06:14.952
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go</i>

06:15.122 --> 06:19.082
<i>According to plan</i>

06:21.292 --> 06:22.792
Look at the way you're standing.

06:22.962 --> 06:25.712
You look like you got rickets
or something...

06:33.722 --> 06:39.482
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccable taste!

06:39.642 --> 06:41.482
Oh, beautiful, innit?

06:43.652 --> 06:45.272
It's not as big as our place, dear.

06:48.782 --> 06:51.152
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?
- Shut up.

06:51.322 --> 06:54.072
Lord and Lady Everglot...

06:54.242 --> 06:57.912
...Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort.

06:58.082 --> 07:00.582
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

07:01.212 --> 07:05.462
Yes, I must say, you don't look a day
over 20. No. Oh, yes.

07:06.502 --> 07:09.262
Smile, darling, smile.

07:13.852 --> 07:18.393
Well, hello. What a pleasure.
Welcome to our home.

07:18.933 --> 07:20.183
Thank you.

07:20.353 --> 07:23.693
We'll be taking tea
in the west drawing room.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.693
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.

07:27.863 --> 07:32.113
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
Who is your decorator?

07:32.283 --> 07:34.323
Nice tiles, shame about the drapes.

07:34.493 --> 07:37.993
My husband says such foolish things.
Ignore him.

07:38.493 --> 07:40.583
Yes, it's usually best.

09:09.003 --> 09:12.593
- Do forgive me.
- You play beautifully.

09:12.763 --> 09:18.013
l... I... I do apologize, Miss Everglot.
How rude of me to... Well...

09:18.763 --> 09:20.263
Excuse me.

09:22.183 --> 09:23.974
Mother won't let me near the piano.

09:24.684 --> 09:27.984
Music is improper for a young lady.

09:28.154 --> 09:29.694
Too passionate, she says.

09:29.864 --> 09:34.654
If I may ask, Miss Everglot...

09:34.824 --> 09:37.154
...where is your chaperon?

09:37.664 --> 09:41.994
Perhaps, in...
In view of the circumstances...

09:42.584 --> 09:45.334
...you could call me Victoria.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.504
Yes, of course. Well...

09:48.294 --> 09:51.714
- Victoria...
- Yes, Victor.

09:52.964 --> 09:55.634
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

09:57.224 --> 09:58.554
M... M...

09:59.014 --> 10:03.144
- Married.
- Yes. Married.

10:04.564 --> 10:08.644
Since I was a child, I've...
I've dreamt of my wedding day.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.194
I always hoped to find someone
I was deeply in love with.

10:12.694 --> 10:15.534
Someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.864
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yes, silly.

10:19.414 --> 10:22.374
No. No, not at all, no.

10:22.994 --> 10:25.544
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.134
What impropriety is this?

10:34.304 --> 10:36.304
You shouldn't be alone together.

10:36.464 --> 10:41.014
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsal.

10:41.184 --> 10:45.644
Pastor Galswells is waiting.
Come at once.

10:48.354 --> 10:51.234
<i>Master Van Dort,
from the beginning. Again.</i>

10:51.404 --> 10:56.694
"With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

10:57.034 --> 11:02.914
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

11:03.074 --> 11:09.084
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

11:09.254 --> 11:14.334
With this ring, I ask you to be mine."

11:15.674 --> 11:18.924
- Let's try it again.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

11:19.094 --> 11:21.514
With this candle...

11:23.934 --> 11:25.764
This candle...

11:27.224 --> 11:28.854
This candle.

11:29.684 --> 11:33.655
- Shall I get up there and do it for him?
- Don't get all aflutter, dear.

11:39.445 --> 11:41.615
With this candle...

11:43.455 --> 11:44.705
Continue!

11:47.125 --> 11:48.955
Get the door, Emil.

11:49.755 --> 11:53.375
Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.795
A Lord Barkis, sir.

12:01.635 --> 12:04.015
I haven't a head for dates.

12:04.185 --> 12:07.185
Apparently,
I'm a day early for the ceremony.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.485
- Is he from your side of the family?
- I can't recall.

12:12.645 --> 12:15.315
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

12:20.745 --> 12:22.495
Do carry on.

12:23.155 --> 12:28.035
Let's try it again, shall we,
Master Van Dort?

12:28.205 --> 12:32.415
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Right.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.505
Right. Oh, right!

12:35.675 --> 12:39.845
- With this... This...
- Hand.

12:40.005 --> 12:42.885
With this hand...

12:43.055 --> 12:44.555
...l... With...

12:44.725 --> 12:47.015
Three steps, three!

12:47.185 --> 12:51.645
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?

12:51.815 --> 12:53.525
- No! No.
- You do not?

12:53.685 --> 12:57.695
No! I meant, no,
I do not not wish to be married.

12:57.865 --> 13:00.235
That is, I want very much to...

13:00.405 --> 13:04.695
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?

13:04.865 --> 13:07.495
The ring? Yes. Of course.

13:11.045 --> 13:13.295
- Dropping the ring.
- Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

13:13.455 --> 13:17.215
- This boy doesn't want to get married.
- How disgraceful!

13:17.585 --> 13:19.255
Excuse me. Got it!

13:22.925 --> 13:25.175
Out of the way, you ninny.

13:26.015 --> 13:30.685
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a
woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

13:31.975 --> 13:36.735
- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.
- Stop fanning it, you fool.

13:40.065 --> 13:44.656
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.
- I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

13:52.706 --> 13:58.586
Enough! This wedding cannot take place
until he is properly prepared.

14:00.216 --> 14:05.766
Young man, learn your vows.

14:20.106 --> 14:24.446
Well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?

14:39.166 --> 14:40.876
Oh, Victoria.

14:41.336 --> 14:45.306
She must think I'm such a fool.
This day couldn't get any worse.

14:45.466 --> 14:51.556
Hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins
as Van Dort boy causes chaos!

14:52.646 --> 14:56.646
Fishy fiancé could be canned!

14:56.816 --> 15:02.486
Everglots all fired up
as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

15:04.066 --> 15:06.656
It really shouldn't be all that difficult.

15:06.826 --> 15:08.996
It's just a few simple vows.

15:09.156 --> 15:13.206
With this hand, I will take your wine.

15:13.376 --> 15:14.786
No.

15:16.046 --> 15:17.706
With this hand...

15:17.876 --> 15:19.546
...I will cup your...

15:19.716 --> 15:21.296
Oh, goodness, no.

15:23.086 --> 15:27.426
With this...

15:27.596 --> 15:30.176
With this candle, I will...

15:31.886 --> 15:33.436
I will...

15:34.096 --> 15:36.226
I will set your mother on fire.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.856
Oh, it's no use.

15:52.407 --> 15:57.037
With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

15:57.207 --> 16:01.877
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.837
Mrs. Everglot.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.717
You look ravishing this evening.

16:08.557 --> 16:13.637
What's that, Mr. Everglot?
Call you "Dad"? If you insist, sir.

16:13.807 --> 16:18.307
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

16:18.817 --> 16:20.477
With this ring...

16:21.237 --> 16:24.857
...I ask you to be mine.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.497
I do.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.128
You may kiss the bride.

18:58.178 --> 19:01.348
- A new arrival.
- He must've fainted.

19:01.518 --> 19:04.308
- Are you all right?
- What...? What happened?

19:04.478 --> 19:07.568
By Jove, man. Looks like
we've got ourselves a breather.

19:07.988 --> 19:10.858
- Does he have a dead brother?
- He's still soft.

19:13.868 --> 19:15.488
A toast, then.

19:21.208 --> 19:22.788
To the newlyweds.

19:22.958 --> 19:24.208
Newlyweds?

19:25.168 --> 19:29.258
In the woods,
you said your vows so perfectly.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.048
I did?

19:31.218 --> 19:32.628
I did.

19:32.798 --> 19:35.048
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

19:37.098 --> 19:40.098
Coming through, coming through.

19:40.268 --> 19:43.138
My name is Paul, I am the head waiter.

19:44.228 --> 19:47.268
I will be creating your wedding feast.

19:47.518 --> 19:49.898
Wedding feast! I'm salivating.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.108
Maggots.

19:54.988 --> 19:56.618
Keep away!

20:01.868 --> 20:05.248
I've got a...
I've got a dwarf.

20:05.418 --> 20:08.709
And I'm not afraid to use him.
I want some questions. Now!

20:08.879 --> 20:12.839
- Answers. I think you mean "answers."
- Thank you, yes, answers.

20:13.009 --> 20:16.639
I need answers.
What's going on here? Where am I?

20:16.799 --> 20:17.929
Who are you?

20:18.099 --> 20:21.469
Well, that's kind of a long story.

20:21.889 --> 20:24.229
What a story it is.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.979
A tragic tale of romance, passion...

20:28.149 --> 20:29.939
...and murder most foul.

20:30.109 --> 20:31.689
This is gonna be good.

20:33.819 --> 20:35.489
Hit it, boys.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.709
<i>Hey, give me a listen
You corpses of cheer</i>

20:49.879 --> 20:52.629
<i>At least those of you
Who still got an ear</i>

20:52.799 --> 20:55.589
<i>I'll tell you a story
Make a skeleton cry</i>

20:55.759 --> 20:59.259
<i>Of our own jubiliciously
Lovely Corpse Bride</i>

20:59.429 --> 21:01.849
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

21:02.019 --> 21:04.769
<i>But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay</i>

21:04.939 --> 21:07.479
<i>You might try and hide
And you might try and pray</i>

21:07.649 --> 21:10.729
<i>But we all end up
The remains of the day</i>

21:11.979 --> 21:13.319
That's right.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.659
<i>Well, our girl was a beauty
Known for miles around</i>

21:19.829 --> 21:22.739
<i>When a mysterious stranger
Came into town</i>

21:22.909 --> 21:25.539
<i>He was plenty good-looking
But down on his cash</i>

21:25.709 --> 21:28.619
<i>And our poor little baby
She fell hard and fast</i>

21:28.789 --> 21:31.629
<i>When her daddy said no
She just couldn't cope</i>

21:31.799 --> 21:34.379
<i>So our lovers came up
With a plan to elope</i>

21:35.049 --> 21:37.509
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

21:37.679 --> 21:40.759
<i>But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay</i>

21:40.929 --> 21:43.469
<i>You might try and hide
And you might try and pray</i>

21:43.639 --> 21:46.809
<i>But we all end up
The remains of the day</i>

22:03.579 --> 22:05.079
That's right.

22:05.619 --> 22:09.329
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up.

22:10.209 --> 22:13.249
Yeah. Like it.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.339
Okay, Chancy, take it.

22:17.590 --> 22:18.840
Yeah.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.060
Yeah!

22:33.980 --> 22:35.900
That's nice.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.490
<i>So they conjured up a plan
To meet late at night</i>

22:40.660 --> 22:43.030
<i>They told not a soul
Kept the whole thing tight</i>

22:43.200 --> 22:45.740
<i>Now, her mother's wedding dress
Fit like a glove</i>

22:45.910 --> 22:48.450
<i>You don't need much
When you're really in love</i>

22:48.620 --> 22:50.960
<i>Except for a few things
Or so I'm told</i>

22:51.120 --> 22:53.750
<i>Like the family jewels
And a satchel of gold</i>

22:53.920 --> 22:56.420
<i>Then next to the graveyard
By the old oak tree</i>

22:56.590 --> 22:58.840
<i>On a dark foggy night
At a quarter to 3</i>

22:59.010 --> 23:02.470
<i>She was ready to go
But where was he?</i>

23:03.140 --> 23:04.470
<i>And then?</i>

23:04.720 --> 23:06.560
<i>- She waited
- And then?</i>

23:06.720 --> 23:09.600
<i>- There in the shadows, was it her man?
- And then?</i>

23:09.770 --> 23:13.190
<i>- Her little heart beat so loud
- And then?</i>

23:13.650 --> 23:17.480
<i>And then, baby, everything went black</i>

23:17.980 --> 23:20.990
<i>Now, when she opened her eyes
She was dead as dust</i>

23:21.150 --> 23:24.030
<i>Herjewels were missing
And her heart was bust</i>

23:24.200 --> 23:26.780
<i>So she made a vow
Lying under that tree</i>

23:26.950 --> 23:29.750
<i>That she'd wait for her true love
To come set her free</i>

23:29.910 --> 23:32.750
<i>Always waiting for someone
To ask for her hand</i>

23:33.380 --> 23:36.250
<i>Then out of the blue
Comes this groovy young man</i>

23:36.420 --> 23:39.170
<i>Who vows forever
To be by her side</i>

23:39.340 --> 23:43.180
<i>And that's the story
Of our Corpse Bride</i>

23:43.340 --> 23:45.090
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

23:45.260 --> 23:48.010
<i>But don't wear a frown,
Because it's really okay</i>

23:48.180 --> 23:51.020
<i>You might try and hide
And you might try and pray</i>

23:51.180 --> 23:56.770
<i>But we all end up
The remains of the day</i>

23:57.230 --> 23:58.520
Yeah.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.870
Victoria, come away from the window.

24:14.170 --> 24:16.210
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.550
He's terrified of the dark.
In fact, when he was a boy...

24:19.710 --> 24:23.800
...he used to wet his combinations
regularly, didn't he, William?

24:23.970 --> 24:25.180
Enter.

24:29.061 --> 24:33.141
Lord Barkis.
I trust the room is to your liking.

24:33.311 --> 24:36.901
Thank you,
you are a most gracious hostess.

24:37.061 --> 24:43.191
Which is why it pains me
to be the bearer of such bad news.

24:47.321 --> 24:50.951
Would you care
to repeat tonight's headline for us?

24:51.121 --> 24:53.121
Hear ye, hear ye!

24:53.411 --> 24:57.921
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the
bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!

24:58.081 --> 25:02.551
The dark-haired temptress and Master
Van Dort slipped away into the night!

25:02.711 --> 25:04.591
And now, the weather.
Scattered showers...

25:04.761 --> 25:07.221
Enough! That will be all.

25:10.181 --> 25:13.721
Mystery woman?
He doesn't even know any women!

25:13.891 --> 25:15.941
Or so you thought.

25:16.811 --> 25:19.231
Do call for me
if you need my assistance...

25:20.611 --> 25:22.441
...in any way.

25:23.941 --> 25:26.901
Good heavens, Finis,
what should we do?

25:27.071 --> 25:28.571
Fetch me musket.

25:28.741 --> 25:30.161
William, do something.

25:30.331 --> 25:32.871
The town crier
probably just had a slow news day.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.831
You know how it is,
you need a little something to cry about.

25:36.001 --> 25:40.501
Regardless, we are one groom short
for the wedding tomorrow.

25:40.671 --> 25:43.841
Not to mention
the financial implications.

25:44.011 --> 25:46.801
A most scandalous embarrassment
for us all.

25:46.971 --> 25:50.431
Oh, give us a chance to find him,
we beg of you.

25:50.601 --> 25:54.431
- Just give us until dawn.
- Very well. Till dawn.

25:55.141 --> 25:58.601
Victor, darling, where are you?

25:59.021 --> 26:02.691
<i>If you ask me,
your boyfriend is kind ofjumpy.</i>

26:02.861 --> 26:05.281
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.

26:05.441 --> 26:07.861
Victor, where have you gone?

26:08.201 --> 26:09.911
I'll keep an eye out for him.

26:10.371 --> 26:11.371
Victor?

26:15.621 --> 26:18.621
There he goes, there he goes!
He's... He's getting away!

26:18.791 --> 26:20.831
Quick, quick, after him!

26:21.001 --> 26:22.251
Victor.

26:27.921 --> 26:28.921
Thank you.

26:29.261 --> 26:30.681
Victor!

26:31.181 --> 26:33.181
Where are you?

26:35.182 --> 26:36.722
Victor?

26:37.392 --> 26:39.442
Where have you gone?

26:39.982 --> 26:42.522
Married, huh? I'm a widow.

26:42.692 --> 26:45.522
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

26:47.192 --> 26:48.902
Victor.

26:50.202 --> 26:51.952
Victor, darling.

26:53.492 --> 26:57.202
Please. There's been a mistake.
I'm not dead.

27:00.872 --> 27:03.712
Excuse me. Excuse me.

27:04.632 --> 27:05.752
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

27:06.302 --> 27:07.842
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:08.632 --> 27:10.092
Victor.

27:12.052 --> 27:15.142
- Dead end.
- Victor!

27:15.432 --> 27:16.892
Hello!

27:25.442 --> 27:27.982
Could have used the stairs, silly.

27:30.452 --> 27:34.662
Isn't the view beautiful?
It takes my breath away.

27:35.872 --> 27:38.122
Well, it would if I had any.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.002
Isn't it romantic?

27:49.422 --> 27:52.682
Look, I am terribly sorry
about what's happened to you...

27:52.842 --> 27:56.142
...and I'd like to help,
but I really need to get home.

27:56.302 --> 27:59.472
- This is your home now.
- But I don't even know your name.

27:59.642 --> 28:03.102
<i>Well, that's a great way
to start a marriage.</i>

28:03.272 --> 28:04.692
Shut up!

28:06.692 --> 28:09.572
- It's Emily.
- Emily.

28:09.732 --> 28:13.572
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

28:14.532 --> 28:16.532
It's a wedding present.

28:29.632 --> 28:30.962
Thank you.

28:52.863 --> 28:54.153
Scraps?

28:56.533 --> 28:57.993
Scraps!

28:58.533 --> 29:00.123
My dog, Scraps!

29:02.623 --> 29:05.583
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

29:05.753 --> 29:07.923
I knew you'd be happy to see him.

29:08.083 --> 29:12.303
Who's my good boy?
Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.

29:12.463 --> 29:15.723
Good boy, Scraps.
Roll over. Roll over.

29:15.883 --> 29:18.803
Good boy, Scraps.
Play dead.

29:20.563 --> 29:21.973
Sorry.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.023
Oh, what a cutie.

29:24.183 --> 29:26.273
You should have seen him with fur.

29:27.103 --> 29:29.983
Mother never approved
of Scraps jumping up like this.

29:30.153 --> 29:33.573
But then again,
she never approved of anything.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.573
Do you think
she would have approved of me?

29:36.863 --> 29:39.283
You're lucky
you'll never have to meet her.

29:41.533 --> 29:42.833
Well, actually...

29:44.253 --> 29:48.083
...now that you mention it,
I think you should.

29:48.253 --> 29:51.253
In fact, since we're, you know...

29:52.303 --> 29:55.013
...married,
you should definitely meet her.

29:55.383 --> 29:58.183
And my father too. We should go
and see them right now.

29:58.343 --> 30:01.093
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?

30:03.013 --> 30:06.183
- What? What is it?
- They're not from around here.

30:06.353 --> 30:07.893
Where are they?

30:08.813 --> 30:10.523
Oh, they're still alive.

30:10.693 --> 30:12.823
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, that is a problem.

30:12.983 --> 30:14.363
What's that, Scraps?

30:15.693 --> 30:17.653
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

30:19.573 --> 30:23.333
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.
- What?

30:23.663 --> 30:25.243
Elder Gutknecht.

30:34.673 --> 30:35.673
Scraps.

30:35.843 --> 30:38.173
Elder Gutknecht...

30:38.593 --> 30:40.093
...are you there?

30:43.103 --> 30:46.063
Hello? Is anyone home?

30:46.933 --> 30:48.393
Hello?

30:59.784 --> 31:01.494
There you are!

31:02.164 --> 31:04.584
Oh, my dear. There you are.

31:04.744 --> 31:07.164
I've brought my husband, Victor.

31:07.334 --> 31:10.124
What's that? Husband?

31:10.504 --> 31:12.754
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

31:13.544 --> 31:17.964
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the land of the living.

31:18.134 --> 31:20.384
Land of the living?

31:23.184 --> 31:24.434
Oh, my dear.

31:24.604 --> 31:26.394
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

31:26.564 --> 31:30.394
Now, why go up there, when
people are dying to get down here?

31:30.564 --> 31:33.654
Sir, I beg you to help.
It means so much to me...

31:34.774 --> 31:38.864
- Us.
- I don't know, it's just not natural.

31:39.034 --> 31:40.944
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

31:41.114 --> 31:43.744
Surely there must be something
you can do.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.334
Let me see what I can do.

31:48.664 --> 31:51.544
Where did I put that book?

31:58.214 --> 32:00.464
I left it here somewhere.

32:03.844 --> 32:05.974
There's the one.

32:19.694 --> 32:21.284
I have it.

32:21.694 --> 32:26.374
A Ukrainian haunting spell.
Just the thing for these quick trips.

32:26.994 --> 32:30.744
- So glad you thought of this.
- Me too.

32:54.354 --> 32:55.734
Now, then...

32:56.944 --> 32:58.364
...where were we?

32:59.574 --> 33:01.654
The Ukrainian haunting spell?

33:10.835 --> 33:13.755
Here we have it. Ready?

33:13.915 --> 33:17.835
Just remember, when you
want to come back, say "Hopscotch."

33:18.005 --> 33:20.755
- Hopscotch?
- That's it.

33:37.275 --> 33:39.485
I spent so long in the darkness...

33:39.655 --> 33:44.365
...I'd almost forgotten how beautiful
the moonlight is.

34:11.645 --> 34:13.935
Hey, I think you dropped something.

34:33.085 --> 34:34.665
Hold on, hold on.

34:36.665 --> 34:41.005
I think I should prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.

34:42.715 --> 34:44.675
I'll go ahead and you...

34:45.514 --> 34:46.965
...wait here.

34:47.554 --> 34:50.185
- Perfect.
- I won't be long.

34:51.014 --> 34:53.935
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

34:54.105 --> 34:55.685
Okay.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.105
No peeking.

35:17.376 --> 35:20.296
If ever I see that Van Dort boy...

35:20.466 --> 35:23.716
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.

35:23.886 --> 35:28.056
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.

35:28.216 --> 35:30.596
You'll have to use a rope.

35:40.486 --> 35:45.316
<i>This is the voice of your conscience.
Listen to what I say.</i>

35:45.486 --> 35:49.696
<i>I have a bad feeling about that boy.
You know he is no...</i>

35:51.786 --> 35:54.166
Go chew someone else's ear for a while.

35:54.326 --> 35:58.086
Victor has gone to see his parents,
just like he said.

35:58.706 --> 36:02.586
If I hadn't just been sitting in it,
I would say that you had lost your mind!

36:02.756 --> 36:07.216
I'm sure he has a perfectly
good reason for taking so long.

36:07.386 --> 36:10.596
I am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?

36:10.766 --> 36:11.806
All right, I will.

36:11.976 --> 36:16.556
After all, he couldn't get far
with those cold feet.

36:55.016 --> 36:59.016
- Victoria.
- Victor? I'm so happy to see you.

36:59.186 --> 37:03.186
Come by the fire. Where have you been?
Are you all right?

37:03.736 --> 37:05.396
l... I...

37:05.606 --> 37:06.946
Oh, dear.

37:07.776 --> 37:11.366
You're as cold as death.
What's happened to you?

37:11.536 --> 37:13.406
Your coat.

37:14.206 --> 37:17.116
Victoria, I confess.

37:18.326 --> 37:21.497
This morning
I was terrified of marriage.

37:23.007 --> 37:27.507
But then, on meeting you,
I felt I should be with you always...

37:27.677 --> 37:31.887
...and that our wedding
could not come soon enough.

37:34.847 --> 37:38.307
Victor, I feel the same.

37:43.187 --> 37:45.857
Victoria, I se... I se...

37:46.027 --> 37:48.567
I seem to find myself married.

37:48.737 --> 37:51.487
And you should know it's unexpected.

37:55.367 --> 37:57.657
My darling,
I just wanted to meet...

38:00.417 --> 38:03.087
Darling? Who's this?

38:03.247 --> 38:06.717
- Who is she?
- I'm his wife.

38:08.127 --> 38:10.677
- Victor?
- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

38:11.137 --> 38:13.387
She's dead. Look.

38:17.057 --> 38:18.347
Hopscotch.

38:21.227 --> 38:24.017
No! No! Victoria!

38:28.897 --> 38:30.857
You lied to me!

38:31.027 --> 38:33.527
Just to get back to that other woman.

38:33.697 --> 38:36.617
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.

38:36.787 --> 38:41.327
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.

38:44.957 --> 38:46.757
She's got a point.

38:47.417 --> 38:52.587
And I thought... I thought
this was all going so well.

39:01.437 --> 39:04.727
Look, I'm sorry, but...

39:04.897 --> 39:06.357
...this just can't work.

39:06.527 --> 39:08.437
Why not?

39:09.447 --> 39:11.647
It's my eye, isn't it?

39:11.817 --> 39:13.487
No. Your eye is...

39:14.617 --> 39:15.907
...lovely.

39:16.787 --> 39:21.117
Listen, under different circumstances,
well, who knows?

39:21.537 --> 39:25.917
But we're just too different.
I mean, you're dead.

39:26.087 --> 39:29.128
You should've thought about that
before you asked me to marry you.

39:29.298 --> 39:32.798
Why can't you understand? It was
a mistake. I would never marry you.

40:03.208 --> 40:05.918
Roses for eternal love.

40:06.998 --> 40:09.378
Lilies for sweetness.

40:12.168 --> 40:13.718
Baby's breath.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.138
Why so blue?

40:21.308 --> 40:24.348
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.

40:24.518 --> 40:27.148
<i>Maybe he should
have his head examined.</i>

40:28.688 --> 40:30.478
I could do it.

40:30.648 --> 40:34.148
Or perhaps he does belong with her.
Little Miss Living.

40:34.318 --> 40:37.698
With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

40:38.198 --> 40:42.368
Oh, those girls are ten a penny.
You've got so much more.

40:42.538 --> 40:44.868
You've got... You've got...

40:45.038 --> 40:47.538
You've got a wonderful personality.

40:54.588 --> 40:59.048
<i>What does that wispy little brat have
That you don't have double?</i>

40:59.218 --> 41:02.848
<i>She can't hold a candle
To the beauty of your smile</i>

41:03.018 --> 41:04.268
How about a pulse?

41:04.438 --> 41:05.768
<i>Overrated by a mile</i>

41:05.938 --> 41:07.228
<i>- Overvalued
- Overblown</i>

41:07.438 --> 41:11.228
<i>If he only knew
The you that we know</i>

41:12.528 --> 41:15.488
<i>And that silly little creature
Isn't wearing his ring</i>

41:15.648 --> 41:19.068
<i>And she doesn't play piano
Or dance, or sing</i>

41:19.238 --> 41:20.988
<i>No, she doesn't compare</i>

41:21.158 --> 41:23.408
<i>- But she still breathes air
- Who cares?</i>

41:23.578 --> 41:24.868
<i>- Unimportant
- Overrated</i>

41:25.038 --> 41:27.248
<i>- Overblown
- lf only he could see</i>

41:27.418 --> 41:29.038
<i>How special you can be</i>

41:29.208 --> 41:33.248
<i>If he only knew
The you that we know</i>

41:39.089 --> 41:44.019
<i>If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain</i>

41:44.769 --> 41:48.479
<i>If you cut me with a knife
It's still the same</i>

41:50.229 --> 41:53.189
<i>And I know her heart is beating</i>

41:53.729 --> 41:56.109
<i>And I know that I am dead</i>

41:56.609 --> 41:58.949
<i>Yet the pain here that I feel</i>

41:59.619 --> 42:02.199
<i>Try and tell me it's not real</i>

42:02.789 --> 42:07.249
<i>And it seems that I still have
A tear to shed</i>

42:11.709 --> 42:14.959
<i>The sole redeeming feature
From that little creature</i>

42:15.129 --> 42:16.509
<i>Is that she's alive</i>

42:16.669 --> 42:18.299
<i>- Overrated
- Overblown</i>

42:18.469 --> 42:21.509
<i>Everybody knows
That's just a temporary state</i>

42:21.679 --> 42:24.889
<i>Which is cured very quickly
When we meet our fate</i>

42:25.059 --> 42:26.599
<i>- Who cares?
- Unimportant</i>

42:26.769 --> 42:28.139
<i>- Overrated
- Overblown</i>

42:28.309 --> 42:31.559
<i>If only he could see
How special you can be</i>

42:31.729 --> 42:36.189
<i>If he only knew
The you that we know</i>

42:41.489 --> 42:46.829
<i>If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain</i>

42:47.199 --> 42:51.249
<i>In the ice or in the sun
It's all the same</i>

42:52.999 --> 42:55.669
<i>Yet I feel my heart is aching</i>

42:56.169 --> 42:59.009
<i>Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking</i>

42:59.169 --> 43:01.679
<i>And the pain here that I feel</i>

43:02.139 --> 43:04.389
<i>Try and tell me it's not real</i>

43:05.179 --> 43:07.849
<i>I know that I am dead</i>

43:08.809 --> 43:13.269
<i>Yet it seems that I still have
Some tears to shed</i>

43:22.359 --> 43:24.319
It's true, Mother!

43:24.489 --> 43:27.239
Victor is married to a dead woman.

43:27.409 --> 43:32.209
I saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.

43:32.369 --> 43:33.919
Victor was in your room?

43:34.079 --> 43:35.459
I have to help him.

43:35.629 --> 43:37.169
The scandal!

43:37.339 --> 43:41.169
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking like a leaf.

43:41.339 --> 43:43.379
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

43:43.549 --> 43:46.930
Fetch her a straitjacket!
She's completely mad!

43:47.100 --> 43:48.970
Come, Hildegarde.

44:22.260 --> 44:25.180
Finis, come to bed at once.

44:45.950 --> 44:48.910
What in heaven's name?

44:51.500 --> 44:54.500
Who could that be at this hour?

44:56.040 --> 44:57.290
Miss Everglot.

44:57.750 --> 45:02.000
What are you doing here? You should be
at home, prostrate with grief.

45:02.170 --> 45:04.880
Pastor Galswells,
I have to ask you something.

45:05.050 --> 45:08.470
- This is most irregular.
- Please, I beg of you.

45:08.640 --> 45:13.140
You are the only one in the village who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

45:13.310 --> 45:16.020
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

45:16.310 --> 45:21.150
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:

45:21.690 --> 45:23.900
Can the living marry the dead?

45:24.150 --> 45:26.950
What on earth are you speaking about?

45:27.110 --> 45:30.070
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

45:30.490 --> 45:32.740
He has a corpse bride!

45:32.910 --> 45:36.620
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
I believe I know the thing to do.

45:42.670 --> 45:44.010
Come with me.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.340
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

45:49.510 --> 45:53.180
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

45:53.350 --> 45:55.641
Her mind has come undone, I fear.

45:55.811 --> 45:57.941
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

45:58.101 --> 46:02.821
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

46:03.441 --> 46:04.781
Take her to her room!

46:04.941 --> 46:07.361
No, I'm telling the truth.

46:07.531 --> 46:09.411
Victor needs my help.

46:09.571 --> 46:11.821
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

46:11.991 --> 46:14.911
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

46:15.081 --> 46:19.541
...and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.

46:20.131 --> 46:24.131
He needs our help! Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

46:24.301 --> 46:28.341
Will the mortification never cease?

46:28.511 --> 46:31.721
It will be years before we can show
ourselves in public again.

46:31.891 --> 46:33.141
What shall we do?

46:33.311 --> 46:36.931
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

46:37.101 --> 46:39.391
- Victor.
- Whatever.

46:39.561 --> 46:44.271
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman like Victoria...

46:44.441 --> 46:46.481
...it's positively criminal.

46:46.651 --> 46:50.861
Why, if I had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

46:51.031 --> 46:55.621
...I would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

46:55.791 --> 46:59.461
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

46:59.621 --> 47:02.501
Alas, I am not married.

47:02.671 --> 47:04.541
I was betrothed some years ago...

47:04.711 --> 47:08.631
...but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

47:08.881 --> 47:12.891
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

47:20.981 --> 47:24.901
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

47:25.071 --> 47:26.361
You found him?

47:26.531 --> 47:29.991
Make haste, my dear,
our relatives will arrive at any moment.

47:30.151 --> 47:33.951
We must have you looking presentable
for Lord Barkis.

47:35.621 --> 47:36.911
Lord Barkis?

47:37.081 --> 47:38.621
He will make a fine husband.

47:38.791 --> 47:42.121
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.

47:42.291 --> 47:44.541
A far better prospect this time.

47:44.711 --> 47:48.421
But I do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

47:48.591 --> 47:51.471
- We must.
- Please, I beg of you.

47:51.631 --> 47:53.051
There must be another way.

47:53.221 --> 47:55.141
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

47:55.301 --> 47:57.811
...we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

47:57.971 --> 47:59.431
We are destitute.

47:59.851 --> 48:01.561
But Victor...

48:01.731 --> 48:04.271
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

48:04.441 --> 48:07.482
You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.

48:10.192 --> 48:12.402
- According to plan.
- According to plan.

48:41.142 --> 48:44.812
Oh, my dear.
Oh, don't look at me that way.

48:44.982 --> 48:49.322
You have only to suffer this union
until death do us part.

48:49.652 --> 48:53.322
And that will come sooner
than you think.

48:56.622 --> 48:58.572
Oh, it's almost dawn!
Where could he be?

48:58.742 --> 49:01.832
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!

49:02.002 --> 49:05.712
Heartbroken bride to wed
wealthy newcomer!

49:05.872 --> 49:08.542
Wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.

49:08.712 --> 49:10.462
Did he say corpse?

49:10.632 --> 49:14.472
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse
would marry our Victor?

49:14.632 --> 49:20.642
Oh, Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

49:37.202 --> 49:39.782
Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?

49:39.952 --> 49:42.242
I think he's trying to kill us.

50:21.413 --> 50:22.743
I...

50:23.953 --> 50:25.793
...think you dropped this.

50:34.923 --> 50:36.263
I'm sorry.

50:36.673 --> 50:40.383
I'm sorry I lied to you
about wanting to see my parents.

50:40.683 --> 50:44.893
It's just this whole day
hasn't gone quite, well...

50:47.523 --> 50:49.193
...according to plan.

51:54.753 --> 51:56.383
Pardon my enthusiasm.

51:56.713 --> 51:58.753
I like your enthusiasm.

52:03.393 --> 52:06.893
- New arrival! New arrival!
- Lights up!

52:10.353 --> 52:11.733
Hurry up, boys!

52:14.693 --> 52:16.313
Drinks for everyone.

52:16.483 --> 52:17.573
Another pint, sir?

52:17.733 --> 52:19.783
- No, no. Just a half.
- No, no. Just a half.

52:25.034 --> 52:27.704
It is impossible
to get good help anymore.

52:27.874 --> 52:30.584
Welcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!

52:30.754 --> 52:35.584
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
- Mayhew?

52:37.094 --> 52:39.504
Mayhew! How nice to see...

52:41.764 --> 52:42.924
I'm so sorry.

52:43.094 --> 52:47.474
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.

52:49.564 --> 52:53.434
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see
the gentleman is parched?

52:54.354 --> 52:57.274
Mayhew, I have to get back.

52:57.444 --> 52:59.984
They all must be worried sick.
How is everyone?

53:00.154 --> 53:04.114
Well, they're still wondering
where you slipped off to.

53:04.284 --> 53:06.494
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

53:06.664 --> 53:08.244
Yes? Yes, how is she?

53:08.414 --> 53:11.334
Well, she's getting married
this evening.

53:11.494 --> 53:13.504
What? Married to who?

53:13.664 --> 53:17.334
Some newcomer,
Lord Somebody-or-Other.

53:17.504 --> 53:18.834
But that's impossible!

53:19.004 --> 53:21.174
Yeah, with you gone and all...

53:21.344 --> 53:24.724
I guess they didn't wanna
waste the cake.

53:26.594 --> 53:27.804
But how could she?

53:27.974 --> 53:30.854
Women, you can't live with them.

53:31.014 --> 53:33.314
You can't live with...

53:35.274 --> 53:40.364
Time to pick up the pieces and...
You know, and move on, I suppose.

53:41.484 --> 53:43.614
Speaking of picking up the pieces?

53:47.034 --> 53:50.324
Victor? Where are you going?

53:53.504 --> 53:58.334
Miss Victoria, we must leave
for the church now.

53:58.714 --> 54:02.174
Yesterday I thought my wedding
would be happy.

54:02.384 --> 54:06.384
Now I feel like I'm caught
in the tide, pulled out to sea.

54:06.554 --> 54:10.264
The sea leads to many places, dearie.

54:11.184 --> 54:14.684
Maybe you'll land somewhere better.

54:20.524 --> 54:25.074
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

54:31.124 --> 54:36.795
With this ring,
I ask you to be mine.

54:40.585 --> 54:45.215
I now pronounce you man and wife.

54:45.805 --> 54:47.765
Oh, oh, dear.

55:03.735 --> 55:05.655
I'm too late.

55:09.905 --> 55:12.415
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?

55:12.575 --> 55:16.795
He just walked off without saying
a word. Are all men like this?

55:16.955 --> 55:19.835
Well, I'm afraid none of them
are very bright.

55:20.005 --> 55:21.925
They get something stuck
in their heads...

55:22.085 --> 55:24.635
...and you can't do a thing with them.

55:25.635 --> 55:28.095
My dear, we have to talk.

55:28.265 --> 55:32.595
- Let me tell her, please. Let me tell her.
- What?

55:32.765 --> 55:35.805
There is a complication
with your marriage.

55:36.315 --> 55:37.815
I don't understand.

55:37.975 --> 55:42.445
The vows are binding
only until death do you part.

55:42.815 --> 55:44.105
What are you saying?

55:44.815 --> 55:47.575
Death has already parted you.

55:48.785 --> 55:50.615
If he finds out, he'll leave.

55:50.785 --> 55:52.825
There must be something you can do.

55:52.995 --> 55:55.785
Well, there is one way.

55:55.955 --> 55:57.835
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.

55:57.995 --> 56:01.045
It requires the greatest sacrifice.

56:01.625 --> 56:05.005
- Go on, get to the good part.
- What is it?

56:05.175 --> 56:07.885
- We have to kill him!
- What?

56:08.055 --> 56:12.805
Victor would have to give up
the life he had forever.

56:13.185 --> 56:17.015
He would need to repeat his vows
in the land of the living...

56:17.185 --> 56:20.475
...and drink from the wine of ages.

56:21.315 --> 56:22.565
Poison!

56:22.815 --> 56:25.985
This would stop his heart forever.

56:26.155 --> 56:29.405
Only then would he be free
to give it to you.

56:32.495 --> 56:35.035
I could never ask him.

56:37.495 --> 56:39.335
You don't have to.

56:41.836 --> 56:43.126
I'll do it.

56:43.546 --> 56:46.506
My boy, if you choose this path...

56:46.676 --> 56:49.506
...you may never return
to the world above.

56:49.676 --> 56:51.266
Do you understand?

56:54.686 --> 56:56.686
I do.

56:57.016 --> 56:59.896
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.

57:03.646 --> 57:06.196
We've decided to do this thing properly.

57:06.356 --> 57:08.776
So grab what you can and follow us.

57:08.946 --> 57:11.536
We're moving this wedding party upstairs.

57:11.696 --> 57:15.866
Upstairs? I didn't know
we had an upstairs.

57:16.036 --> 57:18.576
- Sounds creepy.
- Let's go!

57:19.036 --> 57:22.086
<i>A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have a wedding</i>

57:24.756 --> 57:26.926
Hold on, Victor.

57:27.086 --> 57:30.296
You can't get married looking like that.

57:30.466 --> 57:33.766
<i>The spiders think you're very cute
But goodness knows you need a suit</i>

57:33.926 --> 57:37.806
<i>But have no fears, we're quite adept
We'll have you looking lovely, lovely, lovely</i>

57:37.976 --> 57:40.356
<i>Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely yet</i>

57:41.186 --> 57:44.356
<i>A little stitch, a little tuck
Some tender loving care</i>

57:44.526 --> 57:47.646
<i>A little thread will fix you up
And we've got plenty as you see</i>

57:47.816 --> 57:51.196
<i>And personally guarantee
Our quality repairs</i>

57:51.366 --> 57:54.786
<i>A little here, I'll fix the mess
We're going to do our very best</i>

57:54.946 --> 57:57.576
<i>When everybody sees you
They will all be quite impressed</i>

57:57.746 --> 58:01.626
<i>They will all be quite impressed</i>

58:01.786 --> 58:03.496
<i>A wedding, we're going to have</i>

58:03.666 --> 58:06.756
<i>A wedding cake is no mistake
It must be quite sublime</i>

58:06.926 --> 58:08.676
<i>- We're missing something
- Try some dust</i>

58:08.836 --> 58:10.176
<i>I wish I had more time</i>

58:10.346 --> 58:13.256
<i>Perhaps there's something I can do
These bones might help a bit</i>

58:13.426 --> 58:15.266
- Oh, my nose.
- Sorry.

58:15.426 --> 58:16.676
<i>Wait a minute, that's it</i>

58:16.846 --> 58:18.266
<i>- A little of that
- A little of this</i>

58:18.436 --> 58:20.096
<i>The perfect cake is hard to miss</i>

58:20.306 --> 58:22.606
<i>A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have</i>

58:22.766 --> 58:24.066
<i>A wedding</i>

58:24.226 --> 58:25.856
<i>Huzzah, huzzah</i>

58:26.026 --> 58:28.566
<i>We're going to have a wedding
A wedding</i>

58:29.196 --> 58:34.986
<i>Let's all give out a cheer
'Cause the bride is getting married today</i>

58:36.286 --> 58:39.206
<i>One thing you can surely say
Is we will stand beside</i>

58:39.366 --> 58:42.286
<i>Until the end we will defend
Our one and only bride</i>

58:42.456 --> 58:45.626
<i>Our bride-to-be, our bride-to-be
Our lovely Corpse Bride</i>

58:45.796 --> 58:47.626
<i>Huzzah! Hooray! Huzzah! Hooray!</i>

58:47.796 --> 58:52.007
<i>Our bride is getting married today</i>

58:52.177 --> 58:54.217
- Oh, there she is.
- Here she comes.

58:59.437 --> 59:03.107
<i>Oh, oh, the bride is here</i>

59:03.267 --> 59:07.067
<i>She's waited for this day
For many a year</i>

59:07.237 --> 59:11.407
<i>For this day, for this day
Our hopes and our pride</i>

59:11.567 --> 59:17.787
<i>The bride is here
Here comes the bride</i>

59:17.997 --> 59:21.957
<i>Here comes the bride
Here comes the bride</i>

59:22.167 --> 59:26.127
<i>For this day, for this day
Will last forever</i>

59:26.297 --> 59:30.087
<i>And all of her friends
Will work together</i>

59:30.257 --> 59:33.967
<i>To make it the perfect day
She's always dreamed</i>

59:34.137 --> 59:41.347
<i>Our hopes and our pride
Our bride, our lovely bride</i>

59:42.017 --> 59:44.767
<i>We're going to have a party
Like nobody's ever seen</i>

59:44.937 --> 59:48.647
<i>The living in the land above
Will not know where they've been</i>

59:48.817 --> 59:55.447
<i>The land above
The party of the bride</i>

59:56.277 --> 01:00:02.077
<i>Here comes the bride
On this glorious day of days</i>

01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:06.997
<i>Up to the land of the living</i>

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:14.967
<i>To celebrate</i>

01:00:17.387 --> 01:00:19.887
Oh, dear.

01:00:31.357 --> 01:00:34.737
Quiet down now, everyone.

01:00:39.237 --> 01:00:40.737
Thank you.

01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:46.247
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

01:00:46.917 --> 01:00:49.667
Victoria has found a husband...

01:00:49.837 --> 01:00:54.007
...with all these qualities and more.

01:00:54.177 --> 01:00:56.757
Serendipity brought us together...

01:00:56.927 --> 01:01:02.268
...and no force on earth
could tear us apart.

01:01:22.788 --> 01:01:25.118
There's an eye in me soup.

01:01:34.628 --> 01:01:35.628
Oh, sorry.

01:01:42.678 --> 01:01:43.888
Fetch me musket!

01:01:44.058 --> 01:01:46.178
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!

01:01:46.348 --> 01:01:48.598
Coming through. Coming through.

01:01:51.858 --> 01:01:56.608
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but I used to live in your dead mother.

01:01:57.908 --> 01:01:59.528
Hey, hold on there.

01:02:00.028 --> 01:02:03.578
I love a woman with meat on her bones.

01:02:04.828 --> 01:02:07.368
Finis, who invited these people?

01:02:08.328 --> 01:02:10.458
They must be from your side
of the family.

01:02:10.628 --> 01:02:11.878
Certainly not.

01:02:12.038 --> 01:02:16.008
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

01:02:16.168 --> 01:02:18.128
Finis.

01:02:19.638 --> 01:02:21.848
Where do you keep the spirits?

01:02:30.688 --> 01:02:34.858
In other news, the dead walk the earth!

01:02:39.568 --> 01:02:43.278
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!

01:02:43.448 --> 01:02:44.908
Get back!

01:02:46.288 --> 01:02:48.118
I'll give you such a wallop.

01:02:59.678 --> 01:03:00.928
No.

01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:02.468
Yeah.

01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:18.739
Grandpa?

01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:23.909
- Bounder!
- Sweetie pie.

01:03:24.079 --> 01:03:25.489
- Monster.
- Buttercup.

01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:27.449
- Cad!
- Gertrude!

01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:29.449
Alfred?

01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:34.039
You've been dead for 15 years.

01:03:34.209 --> 01:03:38.089
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

01:03:38.259 --> 01:03:40.009
Ethel!

01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:52.139
Wait. That's it.

01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:55.729
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.

01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:58.319
Money? What money?

01:03:58.479 --> 01:04:00.859
Your dowry. It's my right!

01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:03.029
But my parents don't have any money.

01:04:03.199 --> 01:04:07.909
It's my marriage to you that will
save them from the poorhouse.

01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:10.159
Th... The poorhouse?

01:04:10.619 --> 01:04:14.459
You're lying. It isn't true.
Tell me that you're lying!

01:04:14.629 --> 01:04:18.459
Did things not go according
to your plan, Lord Barkis?

01:04:18.629 --> 01:04:23.429
Well, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectly matched.

01:04:42.239 --> 01:04:45.029
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

01:04:45.199 --> 01:04:49.279
Back to the void
from whence you came!

01:04:49.449 --> 01:04:51.239
You shall not enter here.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:53.999
Back, back!

01:04:54.169 --> 01:04:56.369
Keep it down, we're in a church.

01:04:56.539 --> 01:04:58.459
Evening.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.250
Dearly beloved and departed...

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:43.130
...we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:48.430
Victor?

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:51.890
Living first.

01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:55.520
With this hand...

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:58.770
...I will lift your sorrows.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.650
Your cup will never empty...

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.190
...for I will be your wine.

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.360
Now you.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.580
With this hand...

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.080
...I will lift your sorrows.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.750
Your cup will never empty.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.550
For I will be...

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.850
I will be...

01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:36.390
Go on, my dear.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.770
Your cup...

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.520
...will never empty...

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.650
...for I will be...

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.990
I will be your wine.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.240
She's having second thoughts.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:00.460
I can't.

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.790
What's wrong?

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.920
This is wrong.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.260
I was a bride.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.300
My dreams were taken from me.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.760
Well, now...

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.310
Now I've stolen them
from someone else.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.560
I love you, Victor.

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.231
But you're not mine.

01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:31.861
Victoria!

01:07:46.671 --> 01:07:49.841
Oh, how touching.

01:07:50.011 --> 01:07:52.801
I always cry at weddings.

01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:58.431
Our young lovers together at last.

01:07:58.601 --> 01:08:02.561
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:05.231
But you forget...

01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:07.521
...she's still my wife!

01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:10.361
I'll not leave here empty-handed!

01:08:11.701 --> 01:08:12.861
You?

01:08:15.871 --> 01:08:17.281
Emily?

01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:18.661
You!

01:08:18.831 --> 01:08:21.831
But... But... I left you.

01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:24.711
For dead.

01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:27.381
This woman is obviously delusional!

01:08:35.051 --> 01:08:38.350
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:40.890
Take your hands off her.

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:44.691
Do I have to kill you too?

01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:51.071
Victor, catch!

01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:53.241
Sorry.

01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:10.211
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.

01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:53.962
Touché, my dear.

01:09:54.552 --> 01:09:55.882
Get out.

01:09:56.632 --> 01:09:59.432
Oh, I'm leaving.

01:10:03.932 --> 01:10:06.942
But first a toast. To Emily.

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:11.522
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

01:10:11.982 --> 01:10:13.652
Tell me, my dear...

01:10:13.822 --> 01:10:17.902
...can a heart still break
once it's stopped beating?

01:10:20.912 --> 01:10:22.372
Let me at him! Let me at him!

01:10:22.532 --> 01:10:24.122
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

01:10:25.372 --> 01:10:28.002
We must abide by their rules.

01:10:28.172 --> 01:10:31.382
We are amongst the living.

01:10:31.542 --> 01:10:33.422
Well said.

01:10:49.352 --> 01:10:51.312
Not anymore.

01:10:54.862 --> 01:10:57.742
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.172
New arrival.

01:11:17.842 --> 01:11:21.802
Oh, Victor,
I never thought I'd see you again.

01:11:29.142 --> 01:11:30.642
Wait.

01:11:31.402 --> 01:11:33.652
I made a promise.

01:11:36.362 --> 01:11:38.942
You kept your promise.

01:11:39.782 --> 01:11:41.742
You set me free.

01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:55.633
Now I can do the same for you.
