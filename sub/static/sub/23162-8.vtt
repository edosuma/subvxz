WEBVTT

00:00.234 --> 00:01.929
I'm here to catch
cattle rustlers?

00:08.743 --> 00:10.335
We do not form a posse.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.938
We form a line at the first shower
and then we call the police.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.615
Sharp, he's tough.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.446
Then why is the ranch
in so much trouble?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.611
It would be better for
all concerned if Magnum ceased

00:19.687 --> 00:21.621
sis rustling investigation
immediately.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.487
You didn't think he'd ever need
a helicopter to hunt rustlers.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.180
Okay, Jesse, she's yours.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.653
When counting
the assets of paradise,

02:43.731 --> 02:46.757
you have to start
with geographical diversity.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.064
Take the Big Island of Hawaii,
for instance.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.726
Twenty minutes
in any direction

02:50.805 --> 02:53.296
and you've been to
the dark hills of the Dakotas,

02:54.275 --> 02:55.833
the ranches of Texas,

02:56.510 --> 03:00.276
or even the moon and the
beginning of time. Impressive.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.676
I liked the idea of working
on the Big Island again.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.845
What I didn't like was
the vague job description.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.989
But the one detail I was told
had me on the next plane.

03:10.091 --> 03:12.958
Whatever the investigation,
I'd have a chance to do something

03:13.027 --> 03:15.860
I never get to do
on a case back some.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.864
You can't ride a horse
on Hotel Street.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.594
1859 lava flow.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.936
You been to the Big lsland
before, Mr. Magnum?

03:25.072 --> 03:28.098
A few times, but never
without knowing why.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.210
Well, I'm sorry
I can't fill you in.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.577
Mr. Harbison, he just
told me to call you,

03:35.182 --> 03:37.480
pay you a week's work,
airfare,

03:37.551 --> 03:40.042
and tell you to make sure that
you brought your riding clothes.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.018
A problem big enough to bring
in a private investigator,

03:44.091 --> 03:46.582
and he doesn't discuss it
with his ranch manager?

03:49.130 --> 03:50.791
Maybe it's not
a ranch problem.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.194
Maybe it's something personal.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.565
He'll explain it
when we get there.

04:01.876 --> 04:03.241
Hey, looky, there.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.574
Paniolos.
You call them cowboys.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.672
I call them cowboys on the mainland,
but I live here, remember?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.808
Yeah, well, you can
call these fake.

04:10.885 --> 04:13.251
We don't do that tourist
junk on the Mauna Hoi

04:13.320 --> 04:14.651
Iike they do here
at Quillan's.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.245
They're not real paniolos?

04:16.322 --> 04:18.348
Oh, yeah, they're real.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.250
They work a lot of cattle.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.088
Roundups every day
at Quillan's place.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.827
But the money's
not in the herd.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.533
It's in letting
the tourists pay to watch.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.264
Beef's not good
business right now.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.532
Demand's way off.

04:32.907 --> 04:34.966
Not with me.
Steak and eggs this morning.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.273
That's great. 'Cause then you'll
enjoy the best barbecue on the island

04:38.345 --> 04:41.246
after the roundup.
That's courtesy of Mr. Harbison.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.244
Must be a good
man to work for.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.409
He's real good.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.282
He still wants a cattle ranch.

04:47.188 --> 04:48.485
I don't know.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.718
Too many paniolos these days.
They pose for pictures

04:51.792 --> 04:53.521
and they fish.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.190
Well, that's what
the joggers want, right?

04:56.263 --> 04:58.390
No meat. Fish
three time a day.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.194
And you can't rope a halibut.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.861
Worse than that.
They won't eat grass.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.101
Pretty busy place. I bet you it's
real fun around here when beef demand is up.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.805
Yeah.

05:12.435 --> 05:14.164
This ranch does
better than most.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.683
Mr. Harbison's
a very good businessman

05:16.750 --> 05:20.516
and I got my degree and more porterhouse
to the pound up there in Cal Poly.

05:21.102 --> 05:22.538
I guess we better get started.

05:22.673 --> 05:24.641
Hey, how about some chaps?
Great.

05:26.977 --> 05:28.205
Here we are.

05:31.482 --> 05:33.643
Hey, wait a minute,
what about Mr. Harbison?

05:33.717 --> 05:35.275
Well, he should
be here by now.

05:36.053 --> 05:37.179
Wonder where he is.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.619
Looking good, David.

05:38.789 --> 05:40.882
Very busy man.
Boss will be along later.

05:40.958 --> 05:42.425
How much later?

05:42.493 --> 05:44.017
This is your horse,
right here.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.994
Will, I didn't agree
to take this job yet.

05:46.063 --> 05:47.360
I'd really like
to talk to him.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.127
I understand, but if we wait
here you'll never get to meet him.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.498
Mr. Magnum?
I'm Kenny Harbison.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.366
Welcome to
the Mauna Hoi Ranch.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.666
Hi, Kenny.

05:56.039 --> 05:58.872
Listen, you know where
I might find your dad?

05:59.209 --> 06:01.040
I don't have a father,
Mr. Magnum.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.512
Let's ride out to a spot
where we can talk business.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.878
Better bring a telephone,
Will.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.109
Yes, sir.

06:13.056 --> 06:15.149
I have a little over
30,000 acres,

06:15.225 --> 06:17.523
and we run about
10,000 head, usually.

06:18.429 --> 06:21.364
That's a big operation.
You handle it all by yourself?

06:21.565 --> 06:23.192
Will Kinikawa and me.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.367
Couldn't manage
without old Will, huh?

06:29.473 --> 06:31.441
Well it's a pretty
impressive spread.

06:31.508 --> 06:33.499
Do you
mind if we discuss why I'm here?

06:33.744 --> 06:35.712
I didn't have much choice
about taking over the ranch.

06:35.779 --> 06:38.213
My folks went down in Dad's
plane a couple of years ago.

06:38.282 --> 06:40.273
Mr. Harbison,
telephone.

06:40.350 --> 06:42.409
Chicago market, sir.
Sounds real urgent.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.544
Damn!

06:44.455 --> 06:45.888
Sorry again, Mr. Magnum.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.053
Here you go, sir.
You hang in tough, Mr. Harbison.

06:55.566 --> 06:57.591
Harbison. Larry,
what's going on?

06:57.701 --> 06:58.725
You?

06:58.802 --> 07:00.667
They want to pay how much?
No way, Larry! Yeah, thanks.

07:00.737 --> 07:02.432
Now you tell them
what I told you.

07:03.307 --> 07:05.036
Still don't know
why he hired you?

07:05.108 --> 07:06.268
No way, Larry.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.107
Maybe it's to stand around and talk
to my horse while he's on that phone.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.842
I mean, we've been here an hour, and 58
minutes of it he's been on that mobile.

07:12.916 --> 07:15.180
Mr. Harbison's
a very busy man, sir.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.944
Uh...

07:18.021 --> 07:19.852
Why do you call him
Mr. Harbison?

07:19.923 --> 07:22.084
I mean, okay, yeah,
he's the boss, but...

07:22.159 --> 07:24.753
He can run this ranch
as good as any grown man.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.728
The boy's got my respect.

07:28.532 --> 07:32.127
Harbisons and the Kinikiwas have been
on the Mauna Hoi for a long time.

07:32.903 --> 07:36.771
See, his people were owners,
mine as paniolos.

07:37.474 --> 07:38.600
We happen to be
very good friends.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.404
He's asked me to
call him Kenny.

07:41.345 --> 07:43.973
See, my father called
his father "Mr. Harbison."

07:44.047 --> 07:46.982
It's the same with our grandfather
and it's the same with me.

07:50.287 --> 07:52.755
Come on, Mr. Magnum,
I'm gonna show you something.

07:53.323 --> 07:55.154
My Charolais, Mr. Magnum.

07:56.126 --> 07:59.493
Danielle, Monique, Marie...
Hey, where's Jacques?

07:59.796 --> 08:03.288
Girls, how're you gonna be a big
herd if you don't stay with Jacques?

08:04.134 --> 08:06.125
Kenny,
Jacques will find them.

08:06.203 --> 08:08.603
He knows what
he's supposed to do. I don't.

08:08.672 --> 08:11.232
Now, either you tell me
why I'm here or I'm leaving.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.104
All right, Magnum.

08:15.178 --> 08:18.170
We waited to tell you until we
could show you some evidence, huh?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.340
We?

08:19.416 --> 08:22.112
Yes, all right, I lied.
I know why you're here.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.112
I wanna show you two nights ago,
the poaes hit some things for us.

08:26.189 --> 08:27.247
Poaes?

08:27.324 --> 08:30.725
Local word for rustler. Now you see
why we couldn't tell you up front?

08:30.961 --> 08:33.327
"Come to the Big lsland
and play like Roy Rogers."

08:33.397 --> 08:35.763
You'd have slammed up the
phone laughing. Rustlers?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.092
Cattle rustlers?
Yeah.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.965
You're kidding.
I'm here to catch...

08:42.205 --> 08:43.433
What's that sound?

08:46.343 --> 08:48.368
Mr. Harbison!
We better stop him!

08:49.379 --> 08:50.505
Kenny!

09:07.097 --> 09:08.428
Jesse, we got company.

09:38.862 --> 09:40.124
Let me go!

09:41.465 --> 09:42.454
Let's go!

09:46.236 --> 09:47.396
Let me go!

09:57.481 --> 09:58.914
Why'd you stop me?

09:59.449 --> 10:01.007
We finally had a shot at them!

10:01.084 --> 10:03.917
Those were bullets you were riding
into, Kenny, or didn't you notice?

10:03.987 --> 10:06.478
Yeah. Yeah, well,
I notice you're not laughing anymore.

10:06.556 --> 10:08.421
Guess we showed you more
proof than we expected, huh?

10:08.492 --> 10:10.653
All right, quick, let's go.
We can follow the tire tracks.

10:10.727 --> 10:11.887
Will, wait a minute.

10:11.962 --> 10:13.759
No, you wait a minute.
It's the first time

10:13.830 --> 10:16.822
we've actually caught them in the act.
Now, come on, let's go.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.528
Yeah, Mr. Magnum, you can't afford
to let a lead like this get away.

10:19.603 --> 10:21.798
Oh, I can't? Did I say
I'd take the case?

10:21.872 --> 10:23.499
Did I mention your fee?

10:23.573 --> 10:27.065
Even for the top Pl in the lslands,
10,000 should be pretty fair.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.821
Sure they hit
in broad daylight.

10:41.992 --> 10:43.516
Why stay up all
night to rustle

10:43.593 --> 10:46.721
when you can get away with it
during regular business hours?

10:46.997 --> 10:48.521
What about the police?

10:48.598 --> 10:50.259
Running
round-the-clock stakeouts,

10:50.333 --> 10:53.302
but there's just too much range
to cover it, too many poaes.

10:53.370 --> 10:56.100
Yeah, it seems like a
big well-organized outfit.

10:56.373 --> 10:58.864
Finding this bunch today may
not get you the ringleader,

10:58.942 --> 11:00.671
but it's somewhere to start.

11:01.812 --> 11:03.837
That's all
a famous Pl needs, Will.

11:04.047 --> 11:05.412
One good clue.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.683
Kenny, I don't know
what you've heard,

11:08.785 --> 11:10.480
but I'm not that famous.

11:10.554 --> 11:11.953
Skip the modesty, okay?

11:12.522 --> 11:15.013
I check people out
before I spend big money.

11:15.492 --> 11:18.484
Speaking of big money,
who owns this wind farm?

11:18.762 --> 11:20.161
Quillan.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.593
Produces most of the energy
for this end of the island.

11:26.303 --> 11:29.363
Tourism, power company,
pretty diversified guy.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.533
Oh, yeah, he makes money
on everything.

11:33.009 --> 11:34.340
Except cattle.

11:34.411 --> 11:36.106
Yeah. Quillan uses them
as a write-off

11:36.179 --> 11:38.511
so he doesn't care
what he loses to the rustlers.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.342
They get to me and a lot of the
other ranchers across his land

11:41.418 --> 11:42.578
'cause he doesn't patrol it.

11:42.686 --> 11:43.675
Yup.

11:44.154 --> 11:45.416
Here you go.

11:47.858 --> 11:51.157
Will, we're heading down towards Quillan's
corrals. We're making a wrong turn.

11:51.228 --> 11:52.752
No, sir, I'm not.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.525
I don't get it.

12:02.339 --> 12:03.499
Quillan a rustler?

12:03.573 --> 12:05.370
He loses more cattle
to them than anybody.

12:05.442 --> 12:07.535
You also said it
was a great write-off.

12:08.378 --> 12:10.437
This is where we'll find
the pickup if it's here.

12:15.685 --> 12:16.811
Go.

12:24.861 --> 12:27.125
Maybe we should come back
after the barbecue.

12:27.931 --> 12:30.229
That's mine. That's my tag!

12:31.034 --> 12:32.763
And there's a Double Z
and a Pohani!

12:32.836 --> 12:34.394
Keep your voice down!
Hey, who's that?

12:34.471 --> 12:37.406
Keep it down? They've got cattle
from half the ranches on the island!

12:42.579 --> 12:43.807
Get the horses!

13:16.646 --> 13:18.307
Magnum, the horses!

13:35.799 --> 13:38.996
No, Kenny,
we do not form a posse.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.537
Well, we can't just let
Quillan get away with it. We gotta...

13:41.605 --> 13:45.097
We form a line at the first shower
and then we call the police.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.608
Sorry, but you don't know
this island's politics.

13:47.677 --> 13:49.304
He's right, Mr. Magnum.

13:49.946 --> 13:51.379
The police are
doing all they can.

13:51.448 --> 13:53.916
What they can't do
is go after a John Quillan.

13:54.150 --> 13:56.050
Well, they can
question his paniolos.

13:56.119 --> 13:58.349
I mean, there's no reason to
even think Quillan's involved.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.981
What? No, he has to be...
Hey, Kenny,

14:01.124 --> 14:03.388
why would a guy
that image-conscious

14:03.460 --> 14:06.452
send his men out after us in
front of all those tourists?

14:08.098 --> 14:09.326
Good point.

14:11.568 --> 14:14.594
Okay, Mr. Magnum,
Will and I will let you sort it out.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.039
Suppose you sort
things out for me, Kenny.

14:20.543 --> 14:22.841
Sorry I got back
sooner than you expected.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.103
Well...

14:26.483 --> 14:29.680
A big roundup on the Mauna
Hoi complete with luau?

14:29.753 --> 14:32.085
Miss Harbison, wait, please.
It's my fault...

14:32.155 --> 14:33.747
So all these people tell me.

14:34.057 --> 14:37.390
Will says, "Work good, make things
look good, then we all eat good."

14:39.829 --> 14:42.423
This little charade
still costs some money.

14:44.401 --> 14:47.370
Where'd you get it?
Excuse me, Miss Harbison?

14:48.305 --> 14:51.001
Lynn Harbison.
I'm Kenny's sister.

14:52.275 --> 14:54.743
And whoever you are,
you must be somebody pretty important.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.302
Because he's never gone
this far with a con before.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.006
The ranch is yours,
not Kenny's.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.584
I'm trustee of
what's left of it.

15:03.186 --> 15:05.279
None of these people work here,
except Will.

15:07.924 --> 15:10.119
The Mauna Hoi
is totally broke.

15:38.819 --> 15:41.083
How much has
this day cost you, Kenny?

15:41.288 --> 15:43.552
Not that much. Really.

15:44.492 --> 15:46.187
Will got the paniolos
to work free

15:46.260 --> 15:48.592
just for the promise
of a luau. Come on.

15:48.829 --> 15:50.194
We had to impress you.

15:50.264 --> 15:51.663
I mean, the top Pl
in the lslands

15:51.732 --> 15:54.292
would hardly take a flat-broke
teenager seriously, right?

15:54.368 --> 15:57.201
Kenny, for the last time,
I am not... Will you cut it out?

15:57.872 --> 16:00.067
Sorry, you just don't lie
as well as I do.

16:00.441 --> 16:02.909
Except, some of the lies
weren't necessary, Kenny.

16:02.977 --> 16:06.811
I mean, 3,000 acres impresses
me just as much as 30,000.

16:07.248 --> 16:08.442
Lynn told me.

16:09.683 --> 16:11.674
I just think you should
have leveled with me, Kenny.

16:11.752 --> 16:12.946
Yeah, I know.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.181
You got your day
wasted by a dumb kid.

16:16.023 --> 16:19.254
No. I got intimidated
by a teenage Howard Hughes.

16:21.028 --> 16:24.589
I just thought a kid your age
would be a little more vulnerable.

16:24.665 --> 16:27.156
And now you see how
vulnerable I really am, right?

16:27.835 --> 16:30.827
My sister and l just want to
save our ranch, that's all.

16:30.905 --> 16:32.202
Mr. Harbison.

16:33.073 --> 16:34.131
What?

16:34.208 --> 16:36.438
It won't work.
We gave him our best shot.

16:36.510 --> 16:40.002
Now we just gotta go out and find us
another way, all right? Excuse me.

16:40.114 --> 16:41.911
Oh, this is David Pono.

16:42.183 --> 16:44.276
He helped set up the day today for us.
And not ashamed of it.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.511
Mr. Magnum.
Hi, David.

16:47.288 --> 16:50.587
Yeah, well,
it looks like we're not in a luau mood.

16:50.658 --> 16:53.718
Maybe you and l, David,
better go out and roundup the herd, huh?

16:53.794 --> 16:55.557
Yeah,
when you got 500 head

16:55.629 --> 16:57.358
and try to make it look
like 10,000,

16:57.431 --> 16:59.228
they can get
pretty spread out.

17:00.601 --> 17:02.000
Yeah, right.

17:02.903 --> 17:06.134
Listen, Mr. Harbison, where's your
sister? I want to apologize to her.

17:06.406 --> 17:08.034
Gone to Hilo, shopping.

17:09.210 --> 17:11.440
I guess gas and clothes
don't cost money.

17:11.512 --> 17:12.773
Yeah.

17:13.681 --> 17:16.844
You know, Magnum,
we almost pulled it off, huh?

17:17.017 --> 17:18.314
Didn't we?

17:19.420 --> 17:22.787
I'm gonna miss you.
It's too bad you're gonna be leaving.

17:24.992 --> 17:27.017
Hey, who said
he was leaving?

17:27.328 --> 17:30.024
Mr. Magnum, I'll have you a
week's advance in 12 hours!

17:30.097 --> 17:31.724
Stay till morning? Please?

17:34.602 --> 17:36.399
Well, I don't
have much choice.

17:36.470 --> 17:38.301
I missed
the last flight to Oahu.

17:39.306 --> 17:40.534
That's right.

17:42.643 --> 17:44.577
Maybe I better go
keep an eye on him.

17:44.645 --> 17:45.839
Thanks, David.

17:49.483 --> 17:52.145
That boy is gonna get the money,
you wait and see.

17:52.453 --> 17:55.183
Yeah, I know. Mr. Harbison's
a great businessman.

17:55.389 --> 17:56.788
Don't make fun of him.

17:57.091 --> 17:58.956
I wasn't. I wasn't.
No, don't.

17:59.026 --> 18:00.288
He is a "Mister."

18:00.794 --> 18:03.729
I meant it when I said he could
run this ranch as good as any man.

18:03.797 --> 18:06.425
He dreamed up this
day today all by himself.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.298
The boy ran
a successful ranch, all right?

18:09.370 --> 18:11.065
But, Will, it was all a fake.

18:12.973 --> 18:14.270
Yeah, right.

18:14.842 --> 18:17.367
It was all a fake,
the phone conversations and everything.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.708
But did you listen to his
end of the conversations?

18:19.780 --> 18:21.748
I mean, the kid is sharp,
he's tough.

18:22.483 --> 18:24.576
Then why is the ranch
in so much trouble?

18:26.620 --> 18:28.315
It's not my place to say,
all right?

18:29.757 --> 18:31.224
Hope to see you around again.

19:18.439 --> 19:20.907
Oh. Not enjoying your luau?

19:22.643 --> 19:25.806
Kenny said you went shopping.
I thought you might need some help.

19:26.313 --> 19:28.304
I went to the bank
about a loan.

19:29.950 --> 19:30.974
Any luck?

19:31.051 --> 19:33.349
On a fourth mortgage?
I tried.

19:35.756 --> 19:37.087
Nice plane.

19:37.725 --> 19:40.455
My dad used this one
for flying around the ranch.

19:40.561 --> 19:43.291
He had a twin engine that
he used for longer flights.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.626
The wreck wasn't his fault.

19:47.134 --> 19:50.331
If anybody could have gotten through
that storm, it would have been him.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.700
I guess the ranch was in good
financial shape until his accident?

19:56.176 --> 19:57.939
All this mess is my fault.

19:58.245 --> 20:00.145
Is that what Will
and Kenny told you?

20:00.347 --> 20:01.473
No.

20:03.183 --> 20:04.445
Not exactly.

20:09.690 --> 20:12.659
There were already two mortgages
on the ranch when my folks died.

20:13.260 --> 20:15.057
I got tired of red ink.

20:16.230 --> 20:18.994
The Mauna Hoi's going
to a mainland buyer next week.

20:20.901 --> 20:23.369
But you haven't told Kenny.
No, no.

20:23.804 --> 20:26.170
Hey, come on,
you think I want to sell out?

20:26.240 --> 20:28.834
I just can't keep waiting
for that reward pipe dream

20:28.909 --> 20:30.501
to come true
or some other miracle.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.169
Wait, wait.
What? Reward?

20:33.313 --> 20:34.541
Oh, no.

20:34.915 --> 20:36.610
Oh, no, I don't believe it.

20:36.684 --> 20:39.619
You mean, they were gonna get
your help and then not pay you?

20:39.687 --> 20:41.154
They offered me 10,000...

20:41.221 --> 20:43.689
Out of the 100,000
the Rancher's Association's

20:43.757 --> 20:45.281
posted for the
rustler's capture.

20:45.392 --> 20:47.451
Well, 10,000 is plenty for me,

20:47.528 --> 20:50.361
but I don't think that chances
are as slim as you think they are.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.854
T.C., what are you doing here?

21:14.922 --> 21:17.015
Okay, what's the problem?

21:17.157 --> 21:18.454
What problem, T.C.?

21:18.525 --> 21:21.494
Oh, come on, come on, Thomas,
you know, the trouble you're in.

21:21.795 --> 21:23.023
What trouble?

21:23.797 --> 21:25.287
This trouble.

21:25.432 --> 21:28.697
And you better come up with some answers
or you don't know what trouble is.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.098
I didn't send this, T.C.

21:35.175 --> 21:37.109
Lynn. Lynn Harbison.

21:37.411 --> 21:38.571
Right.

21:39.279 --> 21:41.144
Rick Wright.
Yes, I remember.

21:41.215 --> 21:43.513
When we were on vacation
Oahu, '82!

21:43.584 --> 21:45.074
'8£. Hey, how's your brother?

21:45.152 --> 21:47.177
He's great.
Kenny? You know him?

21:47.254 --> 21:49.347
Know him?
He used to hang around with Lynn a lot.

21:49.423 --> 21:51.288
What a great kid.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

21:51.358 --> 21:52.723
Now that we've had
this little reunion,

21:52.793 --> 21:54.454
can we talk
about this telegram?

21:54.528 --> 21:56.086
Oh, we are, T.C.

21:56.430 --> 21:58.990
Rick, did you ever
mention my name to Kenny?

21:59.066 --> 22:01.000
Well, I might have.

22:01.101 --> 22:03.365
And maybe you exaggerated
a little bit

22:03.437 --> 22:05.769
about my stature
as a private investigator?

22:05.839 --> 22:07.898
Come on, Thomas,
he was just a kid.

22:08.842 --> 22:09.934
Well,

22:10.677 --> 22:14.909
maybe I just told him some big
stories about you, me and T.C., but...

22:14.982 --> 22:18.042
But you didn't think he'd ever
need a helicopter to hunt rustlers.

22:19.019 --> 22:21.146
Oh, I'm glad
you guys think this is funny.

22:21.221 --> 22:23.086
You know, it costs me
money to be here!

22:23.157 --> 22:25.421
I'm sorry, T.C.
I think I can explain.

22:33.433 --> 22:35.663
Miss Harbison,
your brother's been shot.

22:35.736 --> 22:36.998
Oh, my God, Kenny.

22:37.070 --> 22:38.799
I found him up in the
pasture with his cattle.

22:39.673 --> 22:40.970
Poaes.

22:41.241 --> 22:42.640
Rustlers got him.

22:46.313 --> 22:48.611
Doc's not sending Kenny
to the hospital.

22:48.682 --> 22:50.707
The move could
cause further damage.

22:53.287 --> 22:56.154
He's always sworn he'd never
sell any of his Charolais.

22:57.357 --> 22:58.790
Not for anything.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.422
That's how you were getting paid
a week in advance, Mr. Magnum.

23:02.496 --> 23:04.088
You want a beer?

23:04.164 --> 23:05.631
Yeah, thanks.

23:07.401 --> 23:10.393
What happened to that guy who
went to look after him? Pono?

23:11.839 --> 23:13.306
I don't know.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.537
He wasn't around
when I got there.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.745
All I found was Mr. Harbison
and evidence.

23:18.812 --> 23:22.009
That two Charolais had been butchered.
Those damn poaes.

23:22.850 --> 23:24.750
This time they ain't
gonna get away with it.

23:25.352 --> 23:27.718
They always slaughter
what they steal on the spot?

23:28.255 --> 23:29.745
Is that what
the police told you?

23:30.891 --> 23:32.722
No, it just seems to be
the best way

23:32.793 --> 23:35.318
to get stolen cattle
off an island like cars.

23:35.996 --> 23:37.293
Like what?

23:37.664 --> 23:39.393
Like auto theft rings
in Oahu.

23:39.466 --> 23:41.832
They cut up hot cars
and ship them in pieces.

23:41.902 --> 23:45.394
Let me tell you, slaughtered cattle
don't have to leave here like that.

23:46.340 --> 23:48.865
There's a lot of hungry people
on this island, Mr. Magnum.

23:48.942 --> 23:51.809
Then why were they rounded
up for shipment yesterday?

23:53.480 --> 23:54.708
I don't know.

23:55.382 --> 23:57.543
I told the police what
we saw at Quillan ranch.

23:57.618 --> 23:58.949
Oh, you did?

23:59.019 --> 24:01.214
Well, that's fine,
but like I said before,

24:01.288 --> 24:03.153
don't expect them
to investigate it.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.851
Well, you're leaving tomorrow

24:08.929 --> 24:11.363
so it might be a good idea
to go to bed early.

24:11.431 --> 24:12.989
I've decided to stay.

24:16.236 --> 24:17.396
Thanks.

24:17.905 --> 24:20.806
Kenny's gonna be real glad to
know that you're on the case.

24:24.311 --> 24:25.972
He's Kenny to you now?

24:27.414 --> 24:28.403
Mmm-hmm.

24:30.117 --> 24:31.448
Just till I know
he's gonna make it.

24:43.363 --> 24:45.388
T.C.:
He's been gone all night?

24:45.966 --> 24:47.433
Since at least 2:00.

24:48.101 --> 24:51.730
I went to find him as soon as the
doctor told me Kenny was gonna be okay.

24:52.773 --> 24:55.003
I've looked for him
every few minutes since.

24:55.442 --> 24:56.909
Did you find him?

24:57.878 --> 24:59.573
Will's not on the ranch.

25:00.847 --> 25:04.248
Thomas, there's a 30.06 missing
from the office rifle rack.

25:04.318 --> 25:06.479
I'm afraid he's gone after
the men who shot Kenny.

25:06.553 --> 25:08.077
Wait a minute.
Who would he go after?

25:08.155 --> 25:10.123
He's bound to have
had some suspects.

25:10.190 --> 25:12.681
He and Kenny have been
on this poae hunt for weeks.

25:12.759 --> 25:14.158
If he did have suspects,

25:14.227 --> 25:16.457
why didn't he mention
them to me last night?

25:17.731 --> 25:20.427
Look, why don't we check some
of those paniolo villages?

25:20.500 --> 25:21.694
Maybe he just...

25:24.404 --> 25:25.564
Hello.

25:25.939 --> 25:27.566
Yes, he is.
Just a moment, please.

25:27.808 --> 25:29.241
It's the Quillan Ranch.

25:29.509 --> 25:30.999
Who do you know over there?

25:31.078 --> 25:33.569
The police. I spent most of last
night trying to convince them

25:33.647 --> 25:34.944
to make a search
of the place.

25:35.015 --> 25:37.245
I don't think
this caller's a policeman.

25:37.317 --> 25:39.945
He sounds very British
and very upset.

25:42.122 --> 25:44.352
The Quillan Ranch
is a public corporation

25:44.424 --> 25:47.120
and Robin Masters is one of
the principle investors.

25:47.194 --> 25:50.288
Magnum, how could you?
John Quillan is beyond reproach.

25:50.364 --> 25:53.197
Higgins, I was in a corral full
of stolen cattle here yesterday.

25:53.266 --> 25:55.598
Indeed. Well, the local
police called Mr. Quillan

25:55.669 --> 25:58.695
this morning to discuss the
accusation of one Thomas Magnum,

25:58.772 --> 26:00.763
Robin Masters Estate, Oahu.

26:01.408 --> 26:02.670
He called Robin?
No.

26:02.743 --> 26:05.211
I convinced Mr. Quillan to let me
come and deal with the situation.

26:05.278 --> 26:07.439
Now if you will just
offer him an apology.

26:07.981 --> 26:11.542
Apology? Higgins, a kid was nearly
killed yesterday by rustlers.

26:11.618 --> 26:14.348
And the only place I've seen
rustled cattle is on this ranch.

26:14.421 --> 26:15.945
You saw strays.

26:16.056 --> 26:18.889
A few stray cattle got in my herd.
Happens all the time.

26:21.061 --> 26:22.551
John Quillan,
Thomas Magnum.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.362
Then why did
your men jump us?

26:24.431 --> 26:26.194
Not my men. One day hires.

26:26.266 --> 26:28.666
None of my regular paniolos were
involved in that corral fracas.

26:28.735 --> 26:31.431
Well, would you mind giving me the
names of the men who were involved?

26:31.505 --> 26:33.200
Magnum.
Yes, I would.

26:33.273 --> 26:35.468
I want it dropped now.
Even if they weren't my regulars,

26:35.542 --> 26:37.203
brawls are bad publicity
for the ranch.

26:37.277 --> 26:39.336
And a rustling ring on this
ranch is good publicity?

26:39.413 --> 26:42.473
Magnum, that's enough. You've had
your explanation for what you saw.

26:42.549 --> 26:44.244
Damn right. So cut
the implication I'd steal

26:44.317 --> 26:45.545
more cattle to
lose more money.

26:45.619 --> 26:47.678
The herd's just here
for the tourists. Image.

26:47.821 --> 26:50.949
And what if that image provides a
perfect cover? Look, Mr. Quillan,

26:51.024 --> 26:53.549
I'm not accusing you or your
corporation of stealing...

26:53.627 --> 26:56.755
Then stop accusing anyone on
Quillan Ranch of anything now!

26:56.830 --> 26:58.627
I don't know how those cattle
got here and I don't care.

26:58.698 --> 27:00.757
What I do care about
is bad PR, so listen up.

27:00.834 --> 27:03.098
One more visit from you or the police,
and I call Robin.

27:03.170 --> 27:04.694
Mr. Quillan,
that won't be necessary.

27:04.771 --> 27:07.296
Mr. Quillan!
Mr. Quillan! David.

27:07.374 --> 27:09.604
Somebody opened the corral gate.
The cattle are loose.

27:09.810 --> 27:12.438
Damn! And most my men
are out on the range!

27:13.013 --> 27:14.605
Magnum, please go and
help him.

27:14.815 --> 27:16.407
What? They got
paniolos for that.

27:16.483 --> 27:17.950
He just said he
was shorthanded.

27:18.018 --> 27:19.986
The least you could do is
ease the tension by helping

27:20.053 --> 27:21.520
in this moment of crisis.

27:55.122 --> 27:56.316
David.

28:04.965 --> 28:06.159
You okay?

28:06.666 --> 28:08.463
Yeah, but he isn't.

28:18.343 --> 28:20.868
Mr. Masters feels that
we should remain on the island

28:20.946 --> 28:22.971
until the David Pono
matter is resolved.

28:23.048 --> 28:24.606
But it would be
better for all concerned

28:24.683 --> 28:26.275
if Magnum stayed here
at the hotel

28:26.351 --> 28:28.819
and ceased his rustling
investigation immediately.

28:28.887 --> 28:31.219
Because one of his clients
is suspected of murder?

28:31.289 --> 28:32.620
Miss Harbison, please.

28:32.691 --> 28:35.683
Will had nothing to do with David
Pono's death. They were friends.

28:35.761 --> 28:38.924
Mr. Pono was shot
with a 30.06 rifle.

28:38.997 --> 28:41.830
And do you know how many 30.06s
there are on this island?

28:41.900 --> 28:43.834
It's a very common weapon.
Higgins.

28:44.503 --> 28:46.664
Where in God's
name have you been?

28:46.738 --> 28:49.172
The docks.
You're not feeling well?

28:49.941 --> 28:52.501
The shipping docks, Higgins.
Any news about Will?

28:53.111 --> 28:55.443
No. Thomas,
we've been everywhere.

28:55.514 --> 28:58.540
I just came by to tell you that Kenny's
feeling better and he wants to talk to you.

28:58.617 --> 29:01.279
Magnum, you're not to leave.
Go to your room.

29:01.353 --> 29:02.786
Go to my room?

29:02.854 --> 29:06.688
426. Mr. Masters will be calling
you there shortly. He's furious.

29:07.092 --> 29:10.459
Look, I think I'd better go.
I need to get back to Kenny.

29:10.529 --> 29:12.087
Will you tell Kenny
that I'll be over

29:12.164 --> 29:13.597
as soon as I talk to Quillan
and the police?

29:13.665 --> 29:15.963
Yeah.
No, you'll talk to Mr. Masters first.

29:16.034 --> 29:18.696
He wants you to drop this ridiculous
indictment of Quillan Ranch.

29:18.770 --> 29:20.931
Fine. Except, one of the
paniolos who worked there today

29:21.006 --> 29:22.837
may be the head
of the rustling ring.

29:23.842 --> 29:26.777
It's the copies of cash receipts from
three different shipping companies.

29:26.845 --> 29:28.312
Slaughtered and dressed beef

29:28.380 --> 29:30.644
and all the money
went to Jesse Hikina.

29:31.016 --> 29:33.177
The Quillan paniolo
who was at the shooting?

29:33.251 --> 29:36.084
He's a one-day hire.
He asked to be signed on this morning.

29:36.655 --> 29:38.782
You'll wait for
Mr. Masters' approval.

29:38.857 --> 29:40.415
Higgins!
- Mr. Magnum?

29:40.492 --> 29:43.188
Yes. There's an urgent
telephone call for you, sir.

29:43.261 --> 29:44.819
You can take it
at the poolside.

29:44.896 --> 29:48.297
Thank you. Just tell Robin I
don't have time to explain now.

29:48.366 --> 29:52.325
Mr. Magnum, there's an urgent
phone call for you, sir.

29:56.608 --> 29:57.905
T.C.: Thomas?

29:57.976 --> 30:00.001
I finally found a talker.

30:00.078 --> 30:01.943
You don't want
to know the tab.

30:02.013 --> 30:04.880
It's hard to get anybody to talk
about Will, even for the big bucks.

30:04.950 --> 30:07.009
Never mind.
Somebody saw him?

30:07.285 --> 30:08.980
T.C.: Yup. You were rigst.

30:09.221 --> 30:12.213
He spent the night looking
for very specific guys.

30:12.457 --> 30:13.754
Tsere was a buncs,

30:13.825 --> 30:18.228
but you can start with
David Pono and Jesse Hikina.

30:18.396 --> 30:20.296
Thanks, T.C.
Can you keep looking?

30:20.365 --> 30:23.061
Yeah, whole day's
shot for work, anyway.

30:23.134 --> 30:25.602
Oh, is that boy Kenny
still improving?

30:25.670 --> 30:27.467
Yeah, he may even
be able to talk.

30:27.539 --> 30:29.769
Let's just hope he saw
something last night.

30:30.675 --> 30:34.338
But pass the word around that he
may not live through the afternoon.

30:35.113 --> 30:36.273
What?

30:36.581 --> 30:39.106
Will still doesn't know
about Kenny's condition.

30:39.284 --> 30:41.752
Just make sure a lot of
people hear about it, okay?

30:41.820 --> 30:43.344
Okay, if you say so.

30:43.755 --> 30:46.747
Worse than you expected?
I told you he was upset.

30:47.025 --> 30:49.016
Yeah. He may have even
killed a guy.

31:09.380 --> 31:10.779
Mr. Harbison.

31:12.283 --> 31:13.580
Mr. Harbison.

31:14.119 --> 31:16.644
It was me who started
that rumor this afternoon.

31:17.722 --> 31:20.088
Pretty lousy trick,
but I knew it would get you here.

31:20.158 --> 31:21.489
How's he doing?

31:23.061 --> 31:24.722
I'm gonna be okay, Will.

31:25.930 --> 31:27.124
You sure?

31:27.599 --> 31:28.793
Honest.

31:32.403 --> 31:35.702
You could have found out
how he was just by calling in.

31:36.374 --> 31:37.534
Yeah.

31:38.576 --> 31:41.101
I was too afraid
of hearing bad news.

31:41.179 --> 31:42.771
Where've you been all night?

31:43.548 --> 31:45.539
I was out
rounding up the herd. Why?

31:46.317 --> 31:48.547
You didn't happen to stop by

31:48.620 --> 31:51.248
Quillan's ranch checking
for strays this morning?

31:54.325 --> 31:57.920
I don't know, but I get the feeling
I'm being accused of something.

31:58.329 --> 32:01.230
At the least,
of trying to get yourself killed.

32:01.299 --> 32:04.325
Will, please, just let
the police deal with Jesse.

32:04.903 --> 32:06.165
Jesse?

32:06.237 --> 32:08.671
Jesse Hikina? What are you
talking about? What's he done?

32:08.740 --> 32:09.900
Last night,

32:12.177 --> 32:14.077
he was the one that shot me.

32:14.812 --> 32:16.211
I saw him.

32:18.716 --> 32:22.243
Why didn't you tell me you knew he
was the rustler ringleader, Will?

32:22.921 --> 32:24.912
Why'd you hold out on me?

32:32.163 --> 32:34.324
What made you think
that I knew him?

32:34.399 --> 32:38.426
Because you've been out all
night looking for Hikina and David Pono.

32:38.636 --> 32:42.970
Tell me, did David help you arrange
my big lead at the Quillan Ranch?

32:43.308 --> 32:44.639
Come on, Will.

32:44.976 --> 32:46.341
Somebody set me up.

32:48.146 --> 32:49.613
Is it true, Will?

32:54.219 --> 32:55.208
I...

33:00.825 --> 33:02.156
I'm sorry.

33:03.194 --> 33:04.456
I just...

33:05.930 --> 33:10.162
You see, I didn't want
Magnum to suspect Jesse.

33:10.501 --> 33:13.402
Hey, I wanted us to
catch the poaes, all right?

33:14.205 --> 33:16.196
Us?
Sure...

33:16.474 --> 33:17.907
Leave me alone.

33:19.344 --> 33:21.904
Look, Mr. Harbison,
please, just listen.

33:23.815 --> 33:26.409
The Mauna Hoi needed every
penny of that reward money.

33:26.484 --> 33:29.578
I asked you, didn't you remember,
not to bring Magnum in?

33:31.723 --> 33:33.384
We didn't need you, mister.

33:33.958 --> 33:35.050
No, you didn't.

33:35.126 --> 33:37.560
Not if you knew about
Hikina before I got here.

33:39.230 --> 33:40.219
Right...

33:42.800 --> 33:44.461
Well, it doesn't matter.

33:46.004 --> 33:47.801
I'm taking care
of that right now.

33:47.872 --> 33:49.134
Will, no, no!

33:49.674 --> 33:51.403
You can't go after
them by yourself.

33:51.476 --> 33:55.276
You can't go at all. The police want to
talk to you about David Pono's murder.

33:58.816 --> 33:59.976
All right.

34:00.952 --> 34:02.419
Jesse killed him.

34:03.254 --> 34:04.881
He was afraid
that he would talk.

34:05.890 --> 34:08.290
David must have seen
what happened last night.

34:09.527 --> 34:11.358
Then why didn't David talk?

34:11.763 --> 34:14.288
Come on, Will. You still
have to talk to the police.

34:15.766 --> 34:17.063
Yeah.

34:24.442 --> 34:25.636
Far enough, Magnum!

34:34.217 --> 34:36.846
Kenny sad made a dig
about one of my favorite cowboys,

34:36.920 --> 34:38.821
and I wasn't sure I liked it.

34:38.889 --> 34:41.949
I did my first investigative
work as Roy Rogers.

34:42.493 --> 34:44.723
Wits my trusty broom, Trigger,
I kept tse neigsborsood

34:44.795 --> 34:47.060
free of rustlers
and bad guys for years.

34:52.637 --> 34:55.629
My villains in tsose days were
always simple and straigstforward,

34:55.706 --> 34:57.538
just like in Roy's movies.

34:57.742 --> 35:01.109
In tsis case, I was dealing wits a
villain wso was anytsing but simple,

35:01.546 --> 35:04.777
and one wso'd led me on a
very convincing false trail.

35:04.949 --> 35:06.746
Will's leading us
to tse stolen cattle

35:06.818 --> 35:09.082
in Quillan's corral
was for my benefit.

35:09.153 --> 35:11.280
But Jesse's pickup
and tsose paniolos

35:11.356 --> 35:13.221
firing at us sad
been for real.

35:13.324 --> 35:15.690
And unlike Roy,
I sad to deal wits reality.

35:16.394 --> 35:19.488
Even if, in tse end,
I didn't wind up on a sappy trail.

35:31.843 --> 35:33.037
Whoa! Stop.

37:12.977 --> 37:14.171
Hold it, Jesse!

37:40.671 --> 37:42.832
Why didn't you
stay out of this, Magnum?

37:43.007 --> 37:44.565
I wanted Jesse alone!

37:44.876 --> 37:46.901
He's coming back
with the whole bunch now.

37:47.011 --> 37:50.071
Jesse's the only guy who can
name you as one of the rustlers?

37:50.548 --> 37:52.106
I wasn't just one of them.

37:53.518 --> 37:55.383
I started the poae ring.

38:08.099 --> 38:10.795
No. I won't let the
police roam all over this ranch.

38:10.868 --> 38:12.563
That is precisely
why Magnum feels

38:12.637 --> 38:14.468
that the rustlers could be
hiding out here.

38:14.539 --> 38:17.167
Please, Mr. Quillan,
he's gone after Will Kinikawa alone.

38:17.241 --> 38:19.505
The police must have your
permission to search.

38:19.577 --> 38:22.944
The subject's closed, Higgins. Do you
know what the media could do with this?

38:23.047 --> 38:26.346
Far less than they could with the
details of your cattle business.

38:27.952 --> 38:29.613
I've checked your records.

38:29.887 --> 38:32.913
Why do you sell your herd
at one-half the market rate?

38:32.990 --> 38:34.617
The tourists are
a better profit center.

38:34.692 --> 38:36.523
They want to see
cattle moving out everyday.

38:36.594 --> 38:39.154
And in the process, you're driving
the ranchers out of business.

38:39.230 --> 38:40.288
That's their problem.

38:40.364 --> 38:42.730
If they want to survive they
do what I did. Go public.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.495
After four generations
I damn well

38:44.569 --> 38:46.901
didn't want to be the Quillan
who sold out. But it worked.

38:46.971 --> 38:49.235
This ranch shows a big profit.
Yes.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.331
But I know at least
one major stockholder

38:51.409 --> 38:52.933
who won't approve
of your methods.

38:53.010 --> 38:56.241
And, as you say, Mr. Quillan, you're
now only an employee of the ranch.

38:57.081 --> 39:00.482
Either the police commence a search
immediately, or I'll call Robin Masters.

39:02.687 --> 39:06.123
I heard some rumors that rustlers
hide out in an old quarry I started.

39:06.691 --> 39:08.818
I abandoned it
a couple of years ago.

39:09.493 --> 39:13.862
Perhaps where you failed, Jesse
Hikina developed a "profit center."

39:16.200 --> 39:19.397
Jesse's got a fortune up here.
He's gotta come back.

39:19.470 --> 39:21.904
The cash from
his dressed beef business.

39:22.573 --> 39:25.303
The outfit didn't make money
when you were in charge?

39:25.409 --> 39:26.501
No.

39:28.646 --> 39:32.241
I just wanted a few of Quillan's strays,
those he didn't care about,

39:32.950 --> 39:34.918
to feed a lot
of hungry people.

39:34.986 --> 39:36.283
It's still called rustling.

39:36.354 --> 39:38.914
I didn't say l
was proud of it, did l?

39:41.292 --> 39:42.691
Pride's working the cattle.

39:43.928 --> 39:45.691
Pride's making your money
like every man

39:45.763 --> 39:47.993
in your family's done
for 100 years.

39:48.766 --> 39:52.031
But when there's no work for the
paniolos, family's still got to eat.

39:52.436 --> 39:54.301
So you help them out,
you put some food on the table,

39:54.372 --> 39:56.272
till the beef demand
goes back up.

39:57.208 --> 39:58.835
Jesse got greedy?

39:58.909 --> 40:00.103
Oh, yeah.

40:00.711 --> 40:01.871
That's right.

40:02.413 --> 40:05.541
You know, he talked a lot of good,
decent men into going along with him.

40:05.783 --> 40:08.377
And that's when, me and David Pono,
that's when we quit.

40:09.086 --> 40:10.576
But we stayed quiet.

40:12.056 --> 40:15.583
If we had turned them in, they would
have taken me to jail with them.

40:16.560 --> 40:19.085
But I couldn't let that
happen for Kenny's sake.

40:19.330 --> 40:20.319
Oh!

40:20.531 --> 40:22.829
So now it's
helpless little Kenny?

40:22.900 --> 40:25.767
What happened to Mr. Harbison,
the great businessman?

40:25.836 --> 40:27.167
He is.

40:28.172 --> 40:30.697
Only, he can't run
the daily operation.

40:31.375 --> 40:33.935
Rotate the stock,
tend the fences,

40:34.011 --> 40:36.536
the things you only learn
growing up as a paniolo.

40:37.081 --> 40:39.242
Well, he's gonna have to
try now, isn't he?

40:41.252 --> 40:43.447
Oh, come on, Will,
Jesse's gonna be here any minute

40:43.521 --> 40:44.818
with, what, a dozen men?

40:44.889 --> 40:46.186
I'll handle them!

40:47.491 --> 40:49.425
They have to pay
for shooting Kenny.

40:49.560 --> 40:52.427
What are you gonna do? Pick them off
one by one as they charge the shack?

40:52.496 --> 40:54.020
I don't have a choice.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.530
Then I guess you don't have
a choice with me either.

40:59.570 --> 41:01.936
I mean, you don't want
any witnesses, right?

41:02.006 --> 41:03.234
What?

41:03.307 --> 41:04.433
Come on, Will.
If you stop now,

41:04.508 --> 41:05.975
Kenny will still
get the reward money

41:06.043 --> 41:08.841
and you'll be gone a lot shorter
time for rustling than for murder.

41:08.913 --> 41:10.278
If we get out
of here at all.

41:22.426 --> 41:24.257
Sorry, I did have a choice.

41:25.062 --> 41:26.495
I don't now.

41:27.798 --> 41:28.787
Here you go.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.666
You got a chance now.
Out the back door.

41:32.203 --> 41:34.137
If I've got a chance,
so have you.

41:34.371 --> 41:36.999
No. I can't let
Jesse get away!

41:37.441 --> 41:40.376
The whole bunch will be off the island
in an hour. Now, please, just go!

41:53.724 --> 41:55.157
Makai, from where
you are now.

41:55.226 --> 41:57.023
No, Mauka.
Toward the mountain.

41:57.094 --> 41:58.288
A quarry will be at the top.

41:58.362 --> 42:00.592
The rustlers are quarreling
on the top of the mountain.

42:00.664 --> 42:02.188
May I use that, please?

42:02.433 --> 42:05.300
T.C., follow the road
along the ridge to a quarry.

42:05.503 --> 42:08.700
Try to keep tse rustlers
busy until we get tsere. Repeat.

42:08.773 --> 42:11.207
T.C.: Quarry? Got it.
Hey, we'll do our best.

42:36.734 --> 42:37.962
How bad?

42:38.035 --> 42:40.003
Look, all this means
nothing to you, huh?

42:41.639 --> 42:44.164
I can cover you out back!
Now just go, Magnum!

42:44.375 --> 42:46.639
And tell Kenny l
left you up here alone?

43:18.409 --> 43:19.876
We're gonna have to pull out.

43:19.944 --> 43:21.468
Can you land
around the back?

43:27.084 --> 43:29.746
This field is as close
as I can get to the shack.

43:32.022 --> 43:33.649
We'll have to...
T.C., the cattle!

43:33.724 --> 43:35.282
Can you head them
towards the quarry?

44:26.143 --> 44:28.873
Magnum, how you doing?

44:48.899 --> 44:50.298
Stampede!

45:16.760 --> 45:18.159
Freeze! Police!

45:24.835 --> 45:26.097
It's all right. It's fine.

45:26.270 --> 45:28.135
Are you all right?
You okay, Thomas?

45:28.205 --> 45:30.469
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks, guys.

45:39.116 --> 45:40.708
It belongs to you, Will.

45:40.784 --> 45:42.718
Less Magnum's 10,000.

45:44.421 --> 45:45.683
Right.

45:47.091 --> 45:48.854
You'll need it later on.

45:48.926 --> 45:51.554
Lynn and I are headed
for the mainland, I guess.

45:51.996 --> 45:53.896
Kenny agrees that,

45:53.998 --> 45:56.762
well, we just can't manage this
place by ourselves anymore.

45:57.067 --> 45:58.466
Oh, really?

45:58.936 --> 46:00.460
Well, Will disagrees.

46:00.637 --> 46:05.074
After all, you've got
$99,503.65 to blow.

46:06.643 --> 46:09.043
I just get 200
a day plus expenses.

46:11.615 --> 46:13.674
Two hundred a day?
Isn't that a bit steep?

46:13.751 --> 46:17.881
Kenny, come on,
you agreed to pay Magnum the $10,000.

46:18.255 --> 46:21.224
Well, yeah, when I thought he was
the top Pl in the island, but...

46:21.291 --> 46:23.225
I still get
200 a day.

46:24.228 --> 46:26.856
$150? I've got to stretch
this money as far as I can.

46:26.930 --> 46:28.488
You'll stretch it far enough.

46:29.433 --> 46:30.957
You wait and see.

46:32.102 --> 46:34.002
You've only got two years.

46:34.738 --> 46:37.969
I want to see 20, head
when I get back, sir.

46:38.509 --> 46:39.806
Phone, Mr. Harbison.

46:40.677 --> 46:41.871
Urgent.

46:53.090 --> 46:54.352
$175.

46:55.025 --> 46:57.289
I'll let you know
after this phone call.

47:05.836 --> 47:08.304
Double Z?
Kenneth Harbison.

47:09.907 --> 47:13.343
Yeah, I'd like to talk to somebody
about some good breeding stock.

47:14.611 --> 47:16.943
Just Herefords and
Charolais for right now,

47:17.014 --> 47:19.881
but I might need to get into Angus,
if the price is decent.

47:19.950 --> 47:21.417
My ranch manager told me
that you had

47:21.485 --> 47:24.352
the best Hereford steers around.
So let's start there. How much?

47:25.155 --> 47:26.349
What?
