WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.205
[Tom] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:03.337 --> 00:04.873
The DC power grid, the space station,

00:05.005 --> 00:07.793
the president's therapy tapes,
it's all the same hacker, Gamine.

00:07.925 --> 00:11.134
Gamine had to be someone who knew
the president was seeing Dr. Louden,

00:11.261 --> 00:12.717
meaning someone in this building.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.383
To hell with whoever leaked the shrink tapes.
You're the president.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.427
The cabinet voted to have me removed?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.015
They're invoking the 25th Amendment.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.055
Mr. President. Ethan West.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.522
This idea here, sir, is to give you
an opportunity to explain yourself.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.233
[West] The White House produces witnesses
and documents.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.692
And you answer my questions.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.152
| did tell Dr. Louden that we were friends.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.067
I'm cross-referencing the roll
with the 34 folks

00:33.200 --> 00:35.282
who visited the Oval
and could have known about Louden.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.822
Andrea Frost is the only name on both lists.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.320
Andrea Frost?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.155
-Hannah!
-[Hannah grunts]

00:42.668 --> 00:44.909
[Hannah] Agent down. I need an ambulance!

00:49.091 --> 00:51.879
[Kendra] Dr. Louden, Aaron, Emily, you.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.798
-West is only calling four witnesses.
-That he's apprised us of.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.547
Depending on how his case is going,
there may be a few surprises.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.516
He's not obligated to follow
typical notification procedures?

01:00.644 --> 01:04.227
He's not, sir. The 25th Amendment proceeding
is not a typical hearing.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.064
[sighs] One day of prep? No, it's not.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.856
Sir, the procedures here are simple.
The cabinet has already voted to remove you.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.605
They've tabled that vote
in favour of this hearing.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.823
-But the burden of proof is yours.
-I'm at a disadvantage.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.614
Yes, sir. West will inquire into anything
since your swearing-in

01:19.746 --> 01:23.080
that touches your fitness to hold office.
We have no idea what his questions will be.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.041
So I'm gonna have to just sit here
and watch him tear my life apart.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.537
No, sir. You're going to sit there
and watch us win.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.667
[indistinct chatter]

01:36.096 --> 01:38.554
-Hannah, you didn't answer my calls.
-I was at the hospital.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.219
Ten hours ago.
You can't see the president like this.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.888
He needs to know that Andrea Frost
is the hacker and a murderer.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.434
-We need incontrovertible evidence.
-The hell we do.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.775
You can't waltz into the Oval
with blood on your shirt

01:50.902 --> 01:52.859
and convince the president
that his close friend--

01:52.988 --> 01:55.901
- I don't care who she is.
-Hannah, I'm on your side.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.525
But you'll have one shot
at persuading the president.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.745
Go home. Get cleaned up.
Gather your thoughts. Work the case.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.739
| have been working this, for months!

02:04.875 --> 02:07.583
Hannah, I'm sorry about Damian.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.122
| am. But this has to be bulletproof.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.587
You want a smoking gun?
We may never get that.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.004
-Meanwhile, she's still out there.
-I'm not asking you.

02:26.605 --> 02:27.766
[sighs]

02:27.898 --> 02:31.482
-The press wants to know about the budget.
-In process.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.271
Deadline's tonight
or it's a government shutdown.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.484
We go through this every year.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.229
-We're close to a deal.
-How close?

02:36.365 --> 02:40.154
Very close. The Senate leadership agreed
to fund the Medicaid cost of living increases.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.868
Great. An $8 billion win for us.
What do they want in return?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.374
Minor compromises.
They'll come in and button it up.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.035
We'll get the bill
to the president tonight.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.374
We should get that to him sooner.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.915
-[newscaster] The White House is reeling...
-I'll get him in here.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.254
...from the release
of the president's therapy notes.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.090
Kirkman's therapist, Dr. Adam Louden,

02:56.218 --> 02:59.336
paints a troubling portrait
of a presidency in turmoil.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.839
[Kendra] I think that's everything.
It's time, Mr. President.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.806
-I need a moment.
-Yes, sir.

03:18.824 --> 03:19.939
[sighs]

03:34.923 --> 03:36.334
That's not what I said.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.839
-Aren't those your words on the tape?
-[Dr. Louden] Yes, but--

03:40.971 --> 03:43.429
[West] You didn't say
the president was suffering from PTSD?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.968
You're taking it out of context.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.307
[West] You didn't say that
the president was anxious and depressed?

03:51.106 --> 03:54.565
The leak of my tapes has been
professionally devastating for me.

03:54.693 --> 03:59.608
| won't let you compound that humiliation
by mischaracterizing my conclusions.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.949
If you won't let me answer,
| don't need to be here.

04:03.827 --> 04:04.817
The floor is yours.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.287
| never said, at any time,

04:08.415 --> 04:12.249
that Tom Kirkman was unfit to be president
of the United States.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.210
But your notes say
he doubts he can do the job.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.254
Self-doubt is common
when we lose a loved one.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.970
Do his symptoms disqualify him
from the presidency?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.259
| have no expertise

04:26.391 --> 04:29.429
as to the necessary qualifications
of the Oval Office.

04:29.561 --> 04:33.930
Dr. Louden, has the president improved
since you started treating him?

04:34.065 --> 04:36.682
-Absolutely.
-PTSD, anxiety, depression,

04:36.818 --> 04:38.320
all normal responses to a tragedy.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.311
Have they diminished
in the intervening months?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.814
Yes. The diagnoses on my tapes
were provisional.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.032
Is the president currently in sound
mental and emotional health?

04:47.162 --> 04:49.119
-He is.
-[Kendra] Thank you.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.204
[West] You say he's improved.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.873
-But he has good and bad days, right?
-Yes. Like us all.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.299
Mr. Shore, do you have an opinion

05:02.427 --> 05:05.169
as to the president's conduct
of the war against Kunami?

05:05.931 --> 05:10.676
-I'm not sure what you're asking.
-How did he do, Mr. Shore?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.223
He brought to justice a leader
of a regime

05:13.355 --> 05:16.939
that set off a dirty bomb on American soil
and was about to gas its dissidents.

05:17.067 --> 05:21.311
But we didn't find out about the gas
until after we declared war.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.064
Yes.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.034
And the emir wasn't behind the dirty bomb,
was he?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.032
Not directly, no.

05:31.623 --> 05:35.958
So we need to talk about how the president
decided to plunge this country into war.

05:40.090 --> 05:44.049
Secretary Krantz is consulting with NATO
to build a consensus for military options.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.713
We don't need a consensus.
We were attacked.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.338
Yes, sir, but moving without advising
our allies...

05:48.473 --> 05:51.181
Why get bogged down
in diplomatic discussion?

05:51.309 --> 05:52.174
There's a protocol here.

05:52.310 --> 05:56.178
We were attacked!
The protocol is strike back!

05:57.941 --> 05:58.851
He discarded advice,

05:58.984 --> 06:01.396
didn't confer with his allies
and started a war.

06:01.528 --> 06:05.442
-It's his constitutional prerogative.
-To not verify facts? Put lives at risk?

06:05.574 --> 06:07.190
That's his prerogative?

06:10.537 --> 06:13.325
-Yes.
-That's just irrational, right?

06:16.001 --> 06:20.495
[sighs] We won the war. Removed a tyrant.
If that's irrational, then sign me up.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.587
Mr. Shore, is war ever rational?

06:22.716 --> 06:26.300
A conscious decision to kill other human beings
may be necessary,

06:26.428 --> 06:28.385
but I wouldn't call it rational.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.723
George Washington, Woodrow Wilson, FDR.
All took us into war.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.263
By that definition,
they were all irrational, correct?

06:36.688 --> 06:37.598
Correct.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.268
| think President Kirkman's in good company.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.024
[indistinct whispering]

06:44.446 --> 06:45.982
[Darby] Let's take a recess.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.071
[theme music playing]

06:55.248 --> 06:57.364
[Chuck] Here's the bank camera's
shot of the assassin's car.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.956
You can't really make out the license plate.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.621
[Hannah] You can make out
the first two numbers.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.792
They trace back to a silver sedan
registered to Apache Aerospace,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.130
Andrea Frost's company.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.422
Yes, and those two digits also come back
to 814 other plates in the district.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.056
How many of them are silver sedans?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.013
-You're not--
-How many?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.599
Two hundred and twelve.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.689
We also found more writings.

07:22.817 --> 07:26.105
Recent anti-government postings
we can trace back to Gamine.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.853
We know Gamine is Andrea Frost.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.198
We're getting there, okay?
But it's still not enough.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.612
It is for me.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.204
Chuck, she's not just a saboteur.
She's a killer.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.699
The plumber who broke into NASA. Damian.
They're both dead.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.451
We keep looking for evidence
that we already have.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.963
I'm sorry.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.965
About Damian.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.840
| don't know what to say.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.056
Aaron, I'm ready. With or without you.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.232
[Hannah] These are postings
from the dark web message boards

08:02.357 --> 08:05.270
-over several years by user Gamine.
-Gamine.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.892
The postings are anti-government

08:07.028 --> 08:09.520
-and anti-establishment.
-Okay.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.024
Gamine is obsessed
with a British mathematician, Alan Turing,

08:13.159 --> 08:16.572
as you can see from the codes
I've highlighted from the hacks.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.948
These all have a Turing signature.
Here's the clincher.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.745
Gamine, who we know is responsible
for the posts and the hacks,

08:22.877 --> 08:24.959
and we believe several murders,

08:25.088 --> 08:29.707
bought a Turing notebook from an auction
and had it sent to a private club in DC.

08:30.301 --> 08:34.635
The only member of the club who also
visited the White House is Andrea Frost.

08:37.933 --> 08:41.222
Agent Wells, you have been
a tremendous asset to your country

08:41.354 --> 08:43.846
and to this administration.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.474
But I'm deeply troubled
by what you've just told me,

08:46.609 --> 08:48.225
and for a number of reasons.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.275
I'll start with the biggest one first.
You do know who Andrea Frost is?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.607
Unfortunately, sir, I do.

08:54.743 --> 08:58.737
She's not just a friend.
She's a widely respected industrialist.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.159
Someone who helped us save astronauts
from the space station,

09:01.291 --> 09:04.158
-helped us find the dirty bomb.
-All so she could get close to you, sir.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.082
[chuckles] I'm sorry,
| might be missing something here.

09:07.213 --> 09:11.423
Your claim that Andrea Frost
is responsible for the hackings and murder

09:11.551 --> 09:15.089
is solely based on your assertion
that she uses the Internet handle Gamine,

09:15.221 --> 09:18.009
and is a fan of Alan Turing,
which by the way, so am I.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.759
Mr. President, I know
that all of this sounds very far-fetched,

09:21.895 --> 09:26.731
but this conclusion is a product
of months and months of painstaking work.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.017
Have I ever led you astray before?

09:33.948 --> 09:36.940
-Thank you, Agent Wells. That'll be all.
-Sir.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.704
Aaron, you were briefed on this
from the beginning. What the hell?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.452
Sir, Hannah Wells is our best agent.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.750
I'm not disputing that.
But she didn't prove anything.

09:50.882 --> 09:54.000
In fact, from where I sit,
the only thing she managed to do

09:54.135 --> 09:56.797
was smear the name of one of
our country's greatest entrepreneurs.

09:57.472 --> 10:01.761
| grant you her case is not ironclad.
But if you connect all the dots--

10:01.893 --> 10:06.512
And leap to every possible conclusion.
You may - may - have found the hacker.

10:09.359 --> 10:13.148
Hannah Wells took down Patrick Lloyd,
figured out who was behind the dirty bomb.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.815
If she says there's something here,

10:14.948 --> 10:17.360
I'm inclined at least to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

10:17.492 --> 10:21.156
If you expect me to believe any of this,
she needs to come back with more.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.618
A lot more.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.165
[door opens]

10:29.129 --> 10:30.164
[door closes]

10:35.885 --> 10:38.172
Can you find me Dax Minter, please?

10:38.304 --> 10:41.513
Obviously, the therapist tapes concern me.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.633
Not just as an ex-president,
but as an American.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.602
And for the country's sake,
I hope the president

10:47.730 --> 10:50.472
-continues to seek help...
-President Moss. Stand-up guy.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.020
-...on his road to recovery.
-Uh, if you say so.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.895
Hey, I know you, you're Trey Kirkman,
the president's brother.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.230
Ethan West.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.607
-I know who you are.
-Really?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.405
'Cause, uh... I mean, you'd read
the law journals, I'd get it.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.246
But you're not a lawyer,
so that'd be just like a weird hobby.

11:07.250 --> 11:11.244
-Not as weird as a political witch hunt.
-Excuse me?

11:12.213 --> 11:15.080
If you knew what my brother's been through,
type of man he is,

11:15.216 --> 11:18.254
you wouldn't be trying to bring him down.
You'd be giving him a medal.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.804
Excuse me. I have the documents
you wanted, Mr. West.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.843
Great. Good. Thanks.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.842
Nice meeting you.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.931
That's the president's brother.
He's a stand-up guy.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.149
This isn't what we agreed to, senator.
We had a deal.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.939
[Marissa] We're honoring it by funding

11:37.071 --> 11:39.813
the medical research you advocate.
$6 billion.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.815
Which you're offsetting by eliminating
$6 billion

11:41.951 --> 11:43.908
in cost of living increases to Medicaid.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.244
Meaning, if we were to ever discover
new life-saving medication,

11:46.372 --> 11:48.079
most Americans couldn't afford it.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.166
We can't squeeze blood from a stone.
We gotta give somewhere.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.832
How about the billions of dollars of pork
you put into the budget?

11:54.964 --> 11:58.798
If you're referring to the compromises
that have gotten--

11:58.927 --> 12:02.886
There's nothing reasonable
about our failure to care for our sick.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.881
-I'm not signing.
-Your veto would shut down the government.

12:06.017 --> 12:10.227
You want to avoid a government shutdown?
Honor the deal or there's the door.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.889
Sir. [clears throat]

12:20.531 --> 12:22.909
Sir, now may not be the time for hardball.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.117
She's right.
We have till midnight to sort this out.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.578
Fund the budget, then we tackle research.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.868
I'm not gonna be forced
into making a choice

12:31.000 --> 12:34.459
between medical innovation
and access to medical care.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.373
That will not be my legacy.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.463
Nope. It'll be hitting
the self-destruct button

12:42.595 --> 12:44.973
right before getting dragged out of office.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.304
[sighs]

12:53.064 --> 12:57.729
Dax, thank you so much for coming.
It's great to see you, man.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.602
Always, Tom. But I'm assuming
the suddenness of my summons

13:00.738 --> 13:02.115
means this isn't strictly personal.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.232
| wish it was,
but I'm afraid you're right. Please.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.905
How well do you know Dr. Andrea Frost?

13:08.913 --> 13:12.247
Pretty well. A woman like that
in the tech sphere,

13:12.375 --> 13:14.366
she's a unicorn.
Makes an impression.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.922
| asked you here because I think
you're an excellent judge of character.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.462
And I need you to judge hers for me.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.554
Do you think she's capable of sabotage?

13:29.350 --> 13:30.340
Sabotage?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.685
Hacking into governmental
and technological hubs.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.563
If you're asking me could she do it, yeah.

13:37.692 --> 13:41.060
She's brilliant.
If you're asking me would she...

13:41.988 --> 13:44.229
I'm afraid that's what I'm asking.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.320
You don't get to be
the first female tech billionaire

13:51.456 --> 13:53.117
without a ruthless streak.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.785
[chuckles softly]

13:54.917 --> 13:55.907
Yeah.

13:56.878 --> 13:59.245
[sighs] But cyberterrorism?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.122
It just doesn't seem to fit
the profile of the person I know.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.544
| agree.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.760
But how well do we really know anyone?

14:09.599 --> 14:10.589
[Tom] Hmm.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.641
Tom, can I ask if this related
to the hacking--

14:13.770 --> 14:16.387
Dax, I'm afraid
| can't say anything about this.

14:20.902 --> 14:21.937
So...

14:24.030 --> 14:25.862
How you doing with everything?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.196
[chuckles]

14:27.992 --> 14:30.609
Oh, besides the fact that
half the country thinks I'm crazy?

14:34.832 --> 14:38.746
It's been a hard year, but I'm getting by.

14:38.878 --> 14:43.042
If you need a breather, I have a bottle
of 1823 Louis Xlll with your name on it.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.506
When I find the time,
I'd love to share it with you.

14:45.635 --> 14:49.924
Until then, I've got a pretty cool reminder
of you right here in my office.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.924
They're rolling off the assembly lines
as we speak.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.186
Come by. Take a real one for a spin.

14:58.314 --> 15:02.353
Oh, if I'm still sitting in that chair
in three weeks, I'll make it a priority.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.477
You will be. I promise.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.069
Thanks.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.736
Yeah, I'd like to call my next witness.
Please, Dr. Frost.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.540
She's a private citizen.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.748
She has knowledge of
the president's fitness as per the tapes.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.165
[softly] I'm sorry.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.556
Dr. Frost...

15:41.649 --> 15:43.560
are you and the president close friends?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.183
We're friends, yes.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.027
Does he ever discuss his job with you?

15:51.409 --> 15:54.618
Honestly, I don't know
if I can do this anymore.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.409
[sighs] Yes.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.378
So the president confessed doubts to you
about his ability to do the job.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.333
Dr. Frost?

16:11.721 --> 16:12.711
[sighs]

16:13.556 --> 16:14.466
Yes.

16:18.394 --> 16:22.262
The conversation you had with Dr. Frost,
who was in the room with the two of you?

16:22.398 --> 16:23.900
No one.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.734
-Which means she's cooperating with West.
-No, she was subpoenaed.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.445
To testify. Why would she volunteer

16:30.573 --> 16:33.565
details of a private conversation
that incriminates you?

16:34.452 --> 16:38.036
Hannah Wells gave me a dossier on Dr. Frost.
| would like to use it to question her.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.077
-You wanna suggest that she's the hacker.
-Yes, sir.

16:41.209 --> 16:44.042
No, I won't allow it. Understood?

16:45.379 --> 16:46.210
Yes, sir.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.510
[line rings]

16:54.597 --> 16:57.430
Hannah, we need to talk.

16:58.309 --> 17:01.051
There was no one else in the Oval,
besides Frost and the president.

17:01.187 --> 17:05.476
The president sure as hell wasn't cooperating
with West, so Frost is undermining him.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.895
But the president was clear:
we can't question her.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.688
[sighs] So Frost gets away with it.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.733
Unless you can find an ironclad way
to incriminate her.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.733
[indistinct chatter]

17:19.539 --> 17:22.577
Mr. West, I'm Hannah Wells. FBI.
You got a second?

17:23.416 --> 17:25.374
| got half a second.

17:27.088 --> 17:31.127
I'm investigating possible
criminal conduct by Dr. Andrea Frost.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.215
That's not my concern.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.257
It is if you were conspiring with her
to undermine the presidency.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.424
Uh, excuse me?

17:37.557 --> 17:40.891
| understand that Dr. Frost testified
to the contents of a private conversation

17:41.018 --> 17:43.976
her and the president had in the Oval,
which she related to you.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.096
[West] Is there nobody who doesn't know
about this hearing?

17:46.232 --> 17:48.473
My point is, if we make a case
against Dr. Frost

17:48.609 --> 17:50.520
and you aided her attack on the White House,

17:50.653 --> 17:52.360
that makes you
an accessory after the fact.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.571
Let me save you some time,
Agent Hannah Wells.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.532
The conversation you allude to

17:57.660 --> 17:59.992
was brought to my attention
through this anonymous letter.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.112
| did not co-conspire.
| did nothing wrong.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.910
- I just merely received a tip.
-A tip.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.249
You know what a tip is, don't you?

18:07.378 --> 18:10.336
It's the part of the iceberg
this White House is about to slam into.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.881
-The president will never sign this.
-He will because time's up for your boss.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.128
I'm sorry?

18:18.264 --> 18:21.632
This president is under duress.
We are not.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.725
We have to be able to look our constituents
in the eye tomorrow

18:24.854 --> 18:29.098
and explain why we made concessions
with someone who is no longer a viable partner.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.853
What do you mean "no longer viable"?

18:31.986 --> 18:35.024
This is the deal, Emily. The final deal.

18:35.156 --> 18:38.615
| think this president understands
the concept of finality.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.325
We'll be waiting for his answer.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.952
-They know about the hearing.
-Yep.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.876
Any leverage the White House had
just went up in smoke.

18:56.427 --> 19:00.170
If you just inverse those,
let's see what the numbers look like.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.762
Then you need to take--

19:01.891 --> 19:04.508
-So what's next?
-Excuse me?

19:04.644 --> 19:07.102
NASA. The power grid.
The president's therapy tapes.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.845
-What's your next target?
-Do I know you?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.597
I'm Hannah Wells. FBI.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.895
| have no idea
what you're talking about, Agent Wells.

19:13.027 --> 19:16.440
-But I'm a close friend of President Kirkman's.
-A close friend?

19:16.572 --> 19:18.859
You're trying to undermine
his entire administration.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.652
-Is that what friends do?
-What?

19:20.785 --> 19:23.652
You're not just a saboteur, Dr. Frost,
you are a murderer.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.153
And your henchman got the wrong guy.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.667
-You have no idea who you're talking to.
-I know exactly--

19:27.792 --> 19:29.248
So let me enlighten you.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.915
I'm someone who keeps her promises.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.913
And if you ever slander me in public again,

19:35.049 --> 19:39.589
| promise you this will be your last act
working for the government or anyone else.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.557
Obviously, the White House
is aware of the budget deadline

19:53.693 --> 19:56.811
and we're working diligently with the leadership
to resolve our differences.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.937
So then you're confident
of avoiding a shutdown?

19:59.073 --> 20:01.405
-Very confident. Gary Lee.
-[reporters clamoring]

20:01.992 --> 20:05.235
I'm very confident the world
is gonna come crashing down around us.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.489
-Maybe don't say that.
-You know what Nixon did on his last day?

20:08.624 --> 20:12.618
He didn't shut the government down.
He got a haircut. He thanked his staff.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.255
Nixon's goose was already cooked.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.371
And our guy's getting plucked
in front of our eyes,

20:16.507 --> 20:18.498
and yet here we are.
The hunky-dory brigade.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.843
And we carry on until we're carried out.
That's what we do.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.178
Yes, Em, I get that and I'm down.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.264
But it's like Custer's Last Stand
around here.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.977
For all of us. Look, I have to testify
and I can't take the Fifth.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.972
If I'm asked about telling Chuck to break
the law to protect the president...

20:34.108 --> 20:35.815
-What are you going to do?
-[sighs]

20:36.736 --> 20:39.899
Face the music.
That's the order of business today.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.158
Till the band stops playing.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.780
Ms. Rhodes,
are you loyal to the president?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.326
-Of course.
-And you follow his directives?

20:51.125 --> 20:54.743
-I'm his Chief of Staff. I carry them out.
-Let's talk about how you do that.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.255
[Emily] The president deserves
a modicum of loyalty.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.465
-You laundered evidence.
-It's not that simple.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.256
Leaking to make a case against a leaker.
You don't see the irony?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.675
You're missing the big picture here, Kendra.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.516
Our guy is out there bleeding
and he needs our help.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.056
If we get hemmed in
by procedural niceties--

21:13.189 --> 21:15.021
Hemmed in? Procedural niceties?

21:16.567 --> 21:19.355
| don't think I'm the one
missing the big picture here.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.525
The president is obsessed with loyalty.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.070
He's not obsessed.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.693
[West] Preoccupied?

21:29.789 --> 21:33.157
The president is a very loyal man.
He expects it in return.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.499
-And you follow his directives, right?
-Yes, I said that.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.666
If you're preoccupied with loyalty
and you listen to what the president says,

21:38.798 --> 21:42.041
then the preoccupation must be his.
Am I right?

21:44.470 --> 21:45.460
Ms. Rhodes?

21:47.515 --> 21:49.552
You know
what White House employees can't do?

21:49.683 --> 21:53.426
Accost private citizens in public places
and defame them.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.974
You're not getting any of this, are you?

21:56.982 --> 22:00.816
Hannah, I vouched for you to the president.
| put my neck on the line.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.606
What the hell were you thinking?

22:03.656 --> 22:05.317
They're all dead, Aaron.

22:07.952 --> 22:08.737
Who?

22:10.663 --> 22:13.951
Scott Wheeler. Jason Atwood.
John Foerstel. Damian Rennett.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.370
Everyone who gets close to me dies.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.246
Yeah.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.290
I'm sorry.

22:26.887 --> 22:30.005
I'm not gonna let Andrea Frost
get away with this. [ won't let her.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.972
I'm pulling you
from the hack investigation.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.934
Hannah, I have to. You've done enough.

22:51.120 --> 22:51.951
[knock at door]

22:52.538 --> 22:54.745
-Hey.
-[Aaron] Hey, what did he say?

22:54.874 --> 22:58.788
Uh, it's touch and go.
Kendra's great, but so is West.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.915
Yeah, I don't think I helped the cause.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.372
| don't think I did either.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.334
Is that the, um, type 2 diabetes diet?

23:08.470 --> 23:09.722
[chuckles softly]

23:10.556 --> 23:15.972
If everything goes south, I figured
we'll have minutes to leave this building.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.641
And I wanted a souvenir
that wouldn't amount to grand theft.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.143
A sugar shaker?

23:24.194 --> 23:26.982
-You remember Bernie from the cafeteria?
-Mm-hmm.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.445
He put it behind the register.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.316
He said I was over-sweetening my cortados.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.944
-Sweet revenge.
-Yeah.

23:34.079 --> 23:38.243
I'm, uh, taking the scorpion paperweight
the governor of Guam left us.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.992
-Oh, sting of the tail.
-Mm-hmm. [chuckles softly]

23:44.673 --> 23:47.131
Do you ever...
do you ever think about us?

23:51.180 --> 23:52.136
How do you mean?

23:53.182 --> 23:56.720
Well, we had that kiss last year. Once.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.514
And it wasn't bad as far as kisses go.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.310
Definitely serviceable.

24:06.570 --> 24:10.234
You ever wonder what would've happened
if there were a sequel?

24:14.078 --> 24:15.614
I... I did.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.531
[sighs] But I decided long ago
not to pursue it.

24:20.668 --> 24:21.829
Why?

24:22.711 --> 24:26.545
Because then you wouldn't be here.
In my office. A year later.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.041
Exchanging stories about
how we're the two lowest-rent crooks

24:29.176 --> 24:30.632
in the history of the White House.

24:33.389 --> 24:37.474
[Cornelius]
Well, Mr. West, what can I do for you?

24:38.060 --> 24:40.677
It's more a matter of
what can you do for your country.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.730
The cabinet is trying
to remove President Kirkman, sir.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.438
[clicks tongue]
That's a somber occasion.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.986
| take it they have retained you.

24:55.119 --> 24:58.862
| am the humble servant charged with
bringing the relevant facts to light.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.078
| understand you may have some,
Mr. President.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.123
Yes. Yes, I do.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.914
Would you be willing
to share those with the cabinet?

25:11.427 --> 25:12.963
[exhales deeply]

25:13.095 --> 25:15.462
It's as you say, Mr. West.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.385
It's about what I can do for my country.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.887
[West] How far do your concerns about
the president's mental health go back?

25:24.023 --> 25:27.516
[Cornelius] Months. At least
since the death of his wife.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.858
What was the basis of this concern?

25:29.987 --> 25:34.697
| personally observed President Kirkman's
growing and dangerous paranoia.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.157
The second I named you my Secretary of State,

25:37.286 --> 25:39.869
you've been quietly trying
to undermine me. You're disloyal.

25:42.499 --> 25:46.083
As a member of the president's cabinet,
did you notice some mental deterioration?

25:46.211 --> 25:48.543
Since the day of his wife's death, absolutely.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.879
-Did you take these considerations to him?
-Repeatedly.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.461
He was defensive.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.335
Accused me of not supporting him.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.008
What did you notice about
his decision-making after his wife died?

25:58.140 --> 26:00.507
Erratic. At times dangerously impetuous,

26:00.642 --> 26:03.100
at times crippled by indecision.

26:04.146 --> 26:07.684
You fold in the paranoia,
you've got a toxic combination.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.980
In your expert opinion, is Tom Kirkman
fit to continue as president?

26:17.034 --> 26:18.240
No.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.450
No, he is not.

26:25.501 --> 26:30.337
Secretary Moss, did you leave
the Kirkman Administration on good terms?

26:30.464 --> 26:33.001
-No.
-What happened?

26:34.593 --> 26:38.803
| became weary of President Kirkman's
accusations that I was undermining him,

26:38.931 --> 26:42.094
and tired of his failure
to follow my counsel, so I resigned.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.682
In fact, you were fired.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.772
| was not.

26:46.897 --> 26:50.185
-Oh, come on, Mr. Secretary.
-It's Mr. President, Ms. Daynes.

26:50.984 --> 26:54.272
| know what you're implying.
That I'm here on a vendetta.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.486
Except I was not fired.

26:57.199 --> 27:00.237
In fact, President Kirkman
held a press conference

27:00.369 --> 27:04.112
in which he acknowledged
reluctantly accepting my resignation.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.287
Surely you're not suggesting
President Kirkman is a liar?

27:11.505 --> 27:14.918
-How much damage did Moss do?
-He hurt us, sir.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.462
- It was brilliant.
-Excuse me?

27:17.594 --> 27:20.086
Moss leaked classified intel.
Now he's testifying against you.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.213
He helps oust you,
his legal problems are over.

27:24.017 --> 27:27.931
Right. If I somehow
manage to survive this,

27:28.772 --> 27:32.436
my administration's prosecution of him
would look like political retribution.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.356
Yes, sir. Moss is the reason
your cabinet turned against you.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.570
They're all his people.
| appointed them at his recommendation.

27:38.699 --> 27:41.236
They're loyal to him. I'm betting
he orchestrated a whisper campaign.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.030
-Primed his people for the 25th.
- I can't worry about what he did.

27:44.163 --> 27:47.246
| need to worry about what we're going to do.
Kendra, where do we stand?

27:47.374 --> 27:48.409
We're doing our best, sir,

27:48.542 --> 27:51.876
but we need to change hearts and minds
and I'm not sure we're doing that.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.666
[sighs] I just heard from leadership.
More rollbacks.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.088
Everything we've worked for

28:00.220 --> 28:02.211
in the last six months,
they're throwing out.

28:02.347 --> 28:05.760
Mr. President, it's gonna get worse by the hour.
You need to make a deal.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.475
This isn't a deal. They're strong-arming us.

28:07.603 --> 28:09.344
If your last act is
shutting down the government,

28:09.479 --> 28:11.061
it won't seem like an act of conscience.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.272
-It'll seem like spite.
-Or proof of insanity.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.141
[sighs]

28:16.945 --> 28:18.447
Son of a bitch.

28:20.282 --> 28:24.776
Fine. Emily, get the congressional Senate
and leadership back up here.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.279
-We need to button this up.
-[Emily] Yes, sir.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.199
[cell phone rings]

28:28.332 --> 28:31.370
Kendra Daynes. Okay.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.456
Ethan West wants a sit-down.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.879
-[Tom] A compromise?
-[West] Yes, sir.

28:41.011 --> 28:45.380
You step down voluntarily
and return to your post as HUD secretary.

28:45.515 --> 28:48.553
-What's his stated reason for leaving?
-[West] Pick one.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.598
He's not a politician, doesn't like the
aesthetic. No one's gonna bat an eye.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.596
You've a well-deserved reputation for hardball.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.598
Why are you suddenly coming to the table?

28:55.734 --> 28:59.853
Because it's a win-win situation.
Do you need a better reason than that?

28:59.988 --> 29:01.103
[Tom] You're hedging your bets.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.696
Even though the deck's stacked against me,

29:02.824 --> 29:04.861
you're worried I might pull out
an inside straight.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.155
Whatever my reason, it's a gift horse.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.619
Don't look at it in the mouth.

29:10.624 --> 29:14.242
I'm sorry, Mr. West, but if the cabinet
wants me out of this building,

29:14.378 --> 29:16.415
they're gonna have to do it the hard way.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.965
Okay, sir, but when you look back on this,

29:21.093 --> 29:22.925
remember I tried to give you a way out.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.466
[indistinct chatter]

29:38.527 --> 29:40.985
[West] Mr. Kirkman, would you do anything
to protect your brother?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.899
| don't know what you mean by "anything."

29:43.031 --> 29:46.194
Did you confront me
at the White House mess earlier today?

29:48.412 --> 29:51.029
It wasn't a confrontation.
It was a conversation.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.828
A pretty threatening conversation.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.952
| wonder, uh,
did your brother put you up to it?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.880
My brother didn't put me up to anything.

30:02.009 --> 30:05.001
So you confronted me of your own volition?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.047
Yep.

30:06.179 --> 30:10.173
Considering the role I play in your brother's
fate, uh, do you think it's rational?

30:11.143 --> 30:12.679
I'll let you be the judge of that.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.893
It's irrational, but not surprising,

30:15.022 --> 30:17.184
'cause your family
has a history of mental illness.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.473
[indistinct chatter]

30:22.195 --> 30:23.902
We have no such history.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.113
You were diagnosed with bipolar disorder

30:27.242 --> 30:29.904
and spent two weeks
in the hospital in 1998.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.248
| was under observation.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.581
| was going through a break-up
with a long-term girlfriend.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.914
Are you still on your meds?

30:46.511 --> 30:47.501
Yes.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.889
When you're diagnosed, they keep you
on the medication as a precaution.

30:52.517 --> 30:56.101
And your mother was hospitalized
with depression in 19757

30:58.065 --> 31:00.853
She was briefly in a facility.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.769
Mental illness runs in your family.

31:04.905 --> 31:07.772
No. Being human does.

31:09.326 --> 31:14.617
Mr. Kirkman, to your knowledge, has your brother
ever been treated for any mental illness??

31:14.748 --> 31:15.738
No.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.747
Thank you.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.046
Trey.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.098
[sighs] I'm sorry, Tom.

31:35.852 --> 31:36.762
For what?

31:37.771 --> 31:38.977
| hurt you in there.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.973
You think I'm upset
about what you said in there?

31:43.110 --> 31:44.521
[sighs] Why didn't you tell me?

31:46.321 --> 31:47.561
I'm your brother.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.444
[sighs] All those years,
everything you were going through.

31:52.327 --> 31:56.787
You were busy with your own life.
I'd spent mine being a burden. I didn't--

31:56.915 --> 31:58.326
[sighs] Trey, you are not a burden.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.701
| know. I know that now.
| didn't know it then.

32:04.297 --> 32:07.540
When this whole thing is over,
regardless of the outcome,

32:07.676 --> 32:10.589
| want us to go somewhere.
Just the two of us brothers.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.091
And 40 Secret Service?

32:13.223 --> 32:14.338
[chuckles]

32:14.933 --> 32:18.471
Believe it or not, they're pretty good
at keeping a low profile.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.896
It's a deal, big brother.
| know just the place.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.774
Fort Knox. I'll bring one suitcase.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.860
| was hoping that we could go somewhere
that wasn't gonna land you in jail.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.114
-You're gonna show me the UFOs?
-Okay.

32:32.242 --> 32:34.324
Tom, I won't tell anybody, I swear.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.825
| thought I made our position clear.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.450
You made yourself perfectly clear; you're
a couple of unprincipled shakedown artists.

32:42.586 --> 32:45.203
Emily, please remind the political director
who he's talking to.

32:45.338 --> 32:48.126
Of course. Lyor, you're talking to
a couple of unprincipled shakedown artists.

32:48.258 --> 32:49.794
-Thank you.
-We're done here.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.509
[Cameron] You can tell the president
that when the government shuts down,

32:52.637 --> 32:54.844
he has only himself to blame
for everything.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.385
No need, Senator. I think I got the message.

33:00.937 --> 33:03.520
-[stammers] Mr. President, I--
-Don't worry. It's just politics.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.685
You're pushing an advantage.
That's how the game works.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.024
-Yes sir, it is.
-Problem is, I don't play the game

33:08.153 --> 33:11.441
and I'm not about to start.
You both made a deal. I expect you to honor it.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.860
Respectfully, sir, uh,
circumstances have changed.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.360
Not for me.
But if this is, in fact, my last day,

33:17.496 --> 33:20.579
I'm not gonna waste it
striking a compromise I don't believe in.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.539
-That's your choice.
-Yes, it is.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.250
It was also my choice to leave
Vice President Darby a letter

33:25.378 --> 33:29.793
telling her the only budget to sign
was the one we'd previously negotiated.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.543
| expect her to comply with my wishes because,
well... she gave me her word,

33:33.678 --> 33:36.215
-like I gave you mine.
-Uh, Mr. President--

33:36.348 --> 33:39.136
So when the government shuts down,
you can explain to the American people

33:39.267 --> 33:43.511
that the only people whose word
doesn't seem to matter is yours.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.765
Time for playing games, Senators, is over.
Do your job.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.275
[sighs]

33:58.662 --> 34:00.152
Mr. President, it's time.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.449
[Tom sighs]

34:03.500 --> 34:07.994
[West] Mr. President, you've listened
to all of today's testimony, right?

34:08.129 --> 34:09.415
[Tom] Yes.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.788
Was any of it untrue?

34:17.639 --> 34:18.504
[sighs]

34:19.224 --> 34:20.009
No.

34:20.141 --> 34:24.179
When Dr. Louden testified about your problems
after your wife's death, that was accurate?

34:25.605 --> 34:26.389
Yes.

34:26.523 --> 34:30.061
When Aaron Shore said you attacked Kunami
without heeding counsel to wait,

34:30.193 --> 34:32.275
-was that not accurate?
-Yes.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.567
When Emily Rhodes testified
you have a preoccupation with loyalty--

34:35.699 --> 34:37.735
Yes, that was accurate as well.

34:40.786 --> 34:44.621
Today, all of you have heard
what a deeply flawed man I am.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.331
Either because members of my family

34:46.458 --> 34:48.746
have had to struggle through issues
with mental health

34:48.878 --> 34:51.585
or because I've mourned for
and missed my wife too much.

34:56.261 --> 35:00.095
Because I have expected loyalty
from people that I give it to.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.839
Or because I declared war on a country

35:01.975 --> 35:06.264
that I still, to this very day, believe
had every intention of harming us.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.145
[chuckles]

35:09.274 --> 35:11.811
The truth is, I've made mistakes,

35:12.819 --> 35:15.686
but not for any of the reasons
you've heard here today.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.611
| made mine because I'm human.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.485
And it is human to err.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.452
So I find myself sitting here
trying to figure out

35:27.584 --> 35:30.497
why I'm fighting for a job
that I never asked for.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.205
That I never wanted.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.467
One that has cost me dearly.

35:44.684 --> 35:48.678
But I believe the presidency
is more important than any single person.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.724
So, that's why I'm here.

35:55.528 --> 35:59.613
I'm fighting for what I believe
is the integrity of the presidency.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.733
Because I have heard
absolutely nothing here today

36:02.869 --> 36:06.908
that would warrant or justify
the removal of someone, anyone...

36:08.833 --> 36:10.415
from this great office.

36:14.464 --> 36:15.454
[sighs]

36:16.633 --> 36:17.714
It's that simple.

36:23.390 --> 36:26.223
Madam Vice President,
esteemed members of the cabinet,

36:26.351 --> 36:29.434
| need to excuse myself.
| have a budget to sign.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.725
Which will be the only presidential thing
I'll do today.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.416
[phone beeping]

36:59.592 --> 37:00.673
Yes.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.587
Thank you. Send her in.

37:11.104 --> 37:11.935
[Tom sighs]

37:12.856 --> 37:14.392
Madam Vice President.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.894
Mr. President, I came to inform you

37:17.026 --> 37:19.814
that the cabinet
has concluded its deliberations.

37:20.447 --> 37:23.155
| understand. Let's get this over with.

37:24.367 --> 37:27.951
The majority of the cabinet
wishes you to...

37:29.789 --> 37:33.202
continue in your capacity of president.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.828
[Tom sighs]

37:40.717 --> 37:42.583
| was not expecting that.

37:43.887 --> 37:47.926
Please thank them for this opportunity
and their support.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.890
Needless to say,
this has been a difficult time.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.730
Well, sir, it's behind you now.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.353
It's behind all of us.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.811
Madam Vice President,

38:05.658 --> 38:07.524
what made them come to this decision?

38:08.745 --> 38:09.860
[sighs]

38:10.747 --> 38:11.908
Two things, sir.

38:13.583 --> 38:17.542
Your staff's loyalty to you
through everything.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.662
Loyalty is a consequence of leadership.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.333
And leadership
is a touchstone of competence.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.426
And the second thing?

38:29.098 --> 38:30.384
You.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.175
You, sir.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.225
The Tom Kirkman
who started this job 20 months ago,

38:37.357 --> 38:41.316
ambivalent, aspirational,
honest to a fault,

38:41.444 --> 38:44.653
is the same Tom Kirkman
that they saw today.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.898
You have not changed one bit, sir.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.868
-Thank you, Ellenor.
-[chuckles softly]

38:52.622 --> 38:54.238
Thank you, Mr. President.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.944
[sighs deeply]

39:29.659 --> 39:30.569
Mr. President.

39:31.619 --> 39:32.996
Congratulations.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.538
Normally, I'd thank you,
but I think I'll take a pass.

39:36.666 --> 39:40.034
[chuckles] It's like thanking the IRS
after an audit.

39:40.169 --> 39:42.456
| just want you to know that
there was nothing personal, sir.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.923
I'm afraid it was.
It was as personal as it gets.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.258
You should know
that the flaws I listed in my testimony,

39:49.387 --> 39:53.506
personally, I consider to be assets.
Am [ different than my predecessors? Yes.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.383
But it doesn't mean I can't do this job.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.385
Fact is, Mr. West,
you prove my point perfectly.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.899
You've had to face adversity.
You're different.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.937
| consider you to be
one of the best lawyers I've ever seen.

40:04.068 --> 40:07.652
Truth is, I'm surprised.
| would've expected you, of all people,

40:07.780 --> 40:11.990
to understand that simply being different
doesn't necessarily equal bad.

40:12.994 --> 40:16.532
In the end, it doesn't really matter
because you lost.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.952
No, sir. No, I won.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.791
How do you figure?

40:21.920 --> 40:26.084
My agreement was to elicit facts so the cabinet
could make the right decision.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.956
Mission accomplished.

40:28.092 --> 40:28.923
[chuckles softly]

40:29.052 --> 40:33.762
How convenient. It must be nice to live
in a world where you can't lose.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.847
[stutters] No, sir.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.217
It's awful.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.849
Goodbye, Mr. President.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.562
She's waiting for you, sir.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.355
Thank you.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.490
Thank you for getting here
on such short notice.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.616
Mr. President.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.375
[Tom sighs]

41:07.382 --> 41:12.092
Agent Wells, you're a dedicated servant
to your country.

41:12.762 --> 41:16.175
You have made sacrifices,
both personal and professional,

41:16.307 --> 41:18.423
that go beyond the call of duty.

41:18.559 --> 41:22.644
And I want you to know that
that has not gone unnoticed.

41:22.772 --> 41:24.558
Thank you, sir.

41:24.691 --> 41:27.149
But today has been
an object lesson for me.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.187
In accountability.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.904
And I believe everybody in this building
needs to be accountable for what they do.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.272
Yes, sir.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.899
The directive I gave Aaron

41:36.035 --> 41:38.618
was for you to give me
more information on Andrea Frost

41:38.746 --> 41:40.828
so you could build a proper case.

41:40.957 --> 41:44.040
Instead, you chose to accost her,
defame her, humiliate her publicly.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.079
-Sir, may I explain--
-No, you may not.

41:46.212 --> 41:50.376
Your actions constitute
rank insubordination which I cannot accept.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.667
In other words, you've given me no choice.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.880
You can no longer
serve in this administration.

41:58.975 --> 42:00.136
[stutters]

42:00.268 --> 42:02.555
-Mr. President--
-Agent Wells, you've been terminated.

42:02.687 --> 42:05.520
Effective immediately. Goodbye.
