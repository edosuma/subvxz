01:14.080 --> 01:16.710
Delicious.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.080
Francisco, save some
for the guests.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.920
If I must.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.250
Elena, it's such
a wonderful idea

01:24.250 --> 01:26.920
to host an evening
at the palace.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.250
Um, why are we inviting
everyone in the kingdom
here again?

01:30.250 --> 01:32.290
So that they know
we're ready to help them

01:32.290 --> 01:33.830
in any way we can.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.620
And if they need
any magical fixes,

01:35.620 --> 01:37.790
no problem's
too big or small.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.710
I am totally prepared.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.330
Uh, Mateo,
where's your drum wand?

01:42.330 --> 01:43.790
Oh... ( laughs )

01:43.790 --> 01:45.620
I knew I forgot something.

01:45.620 --> 01:48.880
Your Majesties,
the guests are
starting to arrive.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.920
Great. Let's go
greet the people.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.330
To master the guitar,

01:56.330 --> 01:58.790
one must play from
the depth of your soul.

01:58.790 --> 02:00.880
I'd be happy to give you
my tamale recipe.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.210
I used your presto changer
to get dressed today.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.960
It's so good to see
so many of you here.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.960
Ahem!

02:11.830 --> 02:13.880
Oh, hi there.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.460
I'm Mateo,
your royal wizard.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.920
How can I be of service?

02:18.920 --> 02:20.710
Where's the bathroom?

02:20.710 --> 02:23.540
Down the hall
on the left.

02:23.540 --> 02:24.750
Thanks, Marco!

02:24.750 --> 02:26.750
It's Mateo.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.040
And we'll be sure to send
a crew to fill in that pothole.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.670
( sighs )

02:30.670 --> 02:32.120
Thank you, princess.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.790
Your Majesty, I have
a spirit in my attic.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.460
A spirit?

02:37.460 --> 02:40.120
It rattles around,
scratching at the ceiling,

02:40.120 --> 02:42.750
all day and night.
What should I do?

02:42.750 --> 02:44.120
Move!

02:44.120 --> 02:47.000
Elena, it doesn't look
like anyone needs my help,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.710
so I'm gonna go
back to my workshop.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.120
No, no, wait.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.250
This man here has
a noisy spirit in his attic.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.830
Ooh, really?
What kind of spirit?

02:54.830 --> 02:57.710
I could use a potion
or a spell or an elixir.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.080
I don't know.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.830
I just want you
to get rid of it.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.250
Oh, right.
Of course.
No problem.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.750
See? He needed your help.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.710
Yeah, I just thought more people
would wanna talk magic

03:09.710 --> 03:11.500
with the royal wizard.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.920
GIRL: ( gasps )
You're the royal wizard!

03:13.920 --> 03:15.920
I'm... I'm...

03:15.920 --> 03:18.330
I'm...
I'm your biggest fan.

03:18.330 --> 03:21.380
I have a fan?

03:21.380 --> 03:24.330
The matching robe gives it
away, if you ask me.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.880
She wears it
all the time.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.920
The whole reason
Olivia came here tonight

03:27.920 --> 03:29.330
was so she could meet you.

03:29.330 --> 03:30.880
Really?

03:30.880 --> 03:34.330
Olivia, how would you like
a tour of my workshop?

03:34.330 --> 03:36.580
Like one? I'd love one!

03:36.580 --> 03:38.920
I've never been inside
a wizard's workshop.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.250
I've never even met
a wizard before.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.170
I can't believe
this is really happening.

03:42.170 --> 03:43.750
I can't believe
I can't stop talking.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.170
Can I go, Mom?
Can I, can I?

03:46.170 --> 03:47.670
( laughing )
Of course, sweetie.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.290
Great. Come on.

03:49.290 --> 03:51.080
( chuckling )

03:51.080 --> 03:54.540
Oh, um, that's not the only
reason we're here, Your Majesty.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.710
Oh. What else
can I do for you?

03:56.710 --> 03:59.040
The well in our neighborhood
is going dry,

03:59.040 --> 04:00.880
and we don't know why.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.040
Soon, we'll have
no water at all.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.710
That's terrible.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.710
Armando, make a note.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.750
We need to fix their well.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.830
Sorry.

04:10.830 --> 04:13.790
All this talk of dry wells
is making me thirsty.

04:15.790 --> 04:17.960
Whoa! Look at all those
tamboritas.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.750
I've never seen one
up close before.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.540
When I grow up,
I want to be a great wizard

04:23.540 --> 04:25.920
who helps people,
just like you do.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.330
Me? I'm not
a great wizard yet.

04:28.330 --> 04:30.080
I'm still learning, too.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.290
The key is to practice
magic every day,

04:32.290 --> 04:34.880
- and stick with it.
- I wish I could,

04:34.880 --> 04:37.120
but I don't know any magic,
or any wizards,

04:37.120 --> 04:38.750
except you, of course.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.710
Can I hold a real tamborita
before I go?

04:40.710 --> 04:42.710
I don't know when
I'll get another chance.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.580
Sure. Here you go.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.880
Wow!

04:49.880 --> 04:52.880

the first time I held
a tamborita.

- Chihuleti!
- No, wait!

06:59.250 --> 07:01.380
I'm so sorry.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.830
I thought I did it
just like you.

07:03.830 --> 07:06.960
You said Chihuleti,
not Chihufeti,

07:06.960 --> 07:09.040
and you hit
the tamborita too hard.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.620
Magic takes
a lot of practice.

07:11.620 --> 07:13.750
And this is
an advanced spell.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.960
Everything okay in here?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.750
- Uh...
- We're fine.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.380
It was just
a little mishap.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.880
I'd hate to see
what a big mishap looked like.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.540
( giggles )

07:22.540 --> 07:24.330
Olivia, your parents
are ready to go.

07:24.330 --> 07:26.830
Okay.

07:26.830 --> 07:29.790
I'll see you first
thing in the morning, Olivia.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.420
So I can still be
your apprentice?

07:31.420 --> 07:32.920
Of course.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.790
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

07:34.790 --> 07:38.000
I won't mess up again.
I promise.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.960
- I'll show you--
- I remember the way. Thanks!

07:40.960 --> 07:45.580
Um, Mateo, are you sure
you're ready for an apprentice?

07:45.580 --> 07:47.830
Teaching isn't easy.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.580
And neither is magic,
apparently.

07:50.580 --> 07:52.580
She just got
a bit carried away.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.830
Don't worry, it'll be
a long time before

07:54.830 --> 07:57.500
I let her pick up
a tamborita again.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.330
Okay. You want me to have
Octavio build you a new door?

08:01.330 --> 08:02.830
Nah, I'll do it myself.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.620
( cheerful whistling )

08:09.620 --> 08:11.210
How much longer,
Octavio?

08:11.210 --> 08:13.750
Window's almost done.

08:13.750 --> 08:17.580
I was talking about
the whistling.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.580
Good morning.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.750
Oh, Octavio, just the person
I was looking for.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.960
Can you come with me
to check out a dry well?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.620
Sure thing,
Your Majesty.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.500
Right after I finish
the window.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.080
The window can wait.
The kingdom needs you.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.960
And I need
some peace and quiet.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.790
( chuckles )
Ay, Francisco.

08:37.790 --> 08:41.040
Here I am,
ready to apprentice.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.500
- Good morning.
- What are you working on?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.710
A yotzi potion
to get rid of a spirit.

08:45.710 --> 08:46.880
Can I help?

08:46.880 --> 08:50.540
I have something else
for you to work on.

08:50.540 --> 08:51.830
What is it?

08:51.830 --> 08:53.750
An alchemy set.

08:53.750 --> 08:57.080
I want you to learn
how to change liquids
into solids.

08:57.080 --> 09:00.500
But I thought I was gonna
learn spells and potions.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
You're not ready
for that stuff yet.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.710
Every wizard has to start
with the basics.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.460
Oh, um, okay.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.330
Let's begin.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.380
Mix the red powder
into the yellow liquid.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.620
Red into yellow.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.710
Good. Next, pour it
into the blue liquid.

09:15.710 --> 09:17.710
Now...

09:17.710 --> 09:19.000
turn it upside down.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.960
I did it!

09:22.960 --> 09:24.710
Great job!

09:24.710 --> 09:26.000
Now, turn it
back to a liquid.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.380
Wait. Um, aren't you
gonna help me?

09:28.380 --> 09:29.960
I have to get back
to my yotzi potion.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.210
But the instructions
are on the scroll.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.790
Huh?

09:33.790 --> 09:36.210
Hm, looks like I need
another spell book.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.710
Canaza!

09:43.080 --> 09:47.170
Canaza.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.790
( mumbling )

09:48.790 --> 09:50.330
Oh, got it.

09:52.540 --> 09:53.880
Yotzi!

09:53.880 --> 09:55.880
Yotzi.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.420
There we go.

09:57.420 --> 10:00.210
This should take care
of that pesky spirit.

10:00.210 --> 10:02.830
I better make more,
just in case.

10:02.830 --> 10:05.960
Ooh, or I could just use
an abundance spell.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.380
Mocachi!

10:09.750 --> 10:12.290
Mocachi.

10:12.290 --> 10:15.500
- Mateo! Oh, hello, Olivia.
- Hi, Princess Elena.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.380
Ready to get rid
of that spirit in
Señor Salvador's attic?

10:18.380 --> 10:21.750
Yep. I just finished
mixing the yotzi potion.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.750
( coughing )

10:30.830 --> 10:32.880
Oops.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.790
We'll be waiting
in the carriage, Mateo.

10:34.790 --> 10:38.040
I'll be right there.
What happened?

10:38.040 --> 10:40.380
I don't know.

10:40.380 --> 10:42.500
Did you follow
the instructions?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.000
I... I thought so.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.830
Maybe you could
show me how to do it.

10:46.830 --> 10:49.330
I have to go now,
but I'll show you tomorrow.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.120
Let's try again
in the morning.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.330
Okay, but I feel bad
about making a mess.

10:54.330 --> 10:56.210
Can I stay and clean up?

10:56.210 --> 10:59.790
My mom says I should
always clean up my messes.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.920
All right.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.540
Don't touch anything
except the mop and rags.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.620
I won't.
I promise.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.580
I thought the instructions
were clear,

11:12.580 --> 11:15.250
but I turned my back
for a few seconds,
and poof!

11:15.250 --> 11:16.960
That's the thing
about teaching, Mateo.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.960
It's kind of
a full-time job.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.460
You have to guide them
every step of the way,

11:21.460 --> 11:23.790
or you get a face full
of purple smoke.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.420
( coughs )

11:25.420 --> 11:27.420
Sorry about that.

11:27.420 --> 11:33.120
Here she is, in
the not-so-secret
anymore workshop.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.330
Lucas, what are
you doing here?

11:35.330 --> 11:37.500
Our cat went up a tree
and got stuck on a branch

11:37.500 --> 11:39.880
that could break any second;
no one can climb up to get him.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.420
- Señor Whiskers is in trouble?
- Uh-huh, and Mom thought,

11:43.420 --> 11:45.290
since you were friends
with the royal wizard,

11:45.290 --> 11:47.540
maybe he has a spell
that can save Señor Whiskers.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.920
He's not here, but...

11:51.420 --> 11:53.920
I'm not supposed to,

11:53.920 --> 11:57.500
but I do know a spell...
sort of.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.920
Oh.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.580
I'm sorry, Mateo,

12:00.580 --> 12:02.620
but I have to help
Señor Whiskers.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.460
The spirit,
it's always up here,

12:09.460 --> 12:11.500
- scratching.
- Hmm.

12:12.790 --> 12:14.750
I don't hear anything now.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.880
- ( scratching )
- It's the spirit!

12:16.880 --> 12:18.120
Get back, everyone.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.710
All right, I've got
plenty of potion.

12:21.710 --> 12:24.540
Hey, looks like
your spirit is a mouse.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.540
A spirit mouse?

12:26.540 --> 12:28.880
No, just a mouse.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.790
Okay, at least
the problem is solved.

12:30.790 --> 12:32.460
On to the well.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.250
( donkey braying )

12:34.250 --> 12:35.710
Where is he?

12:35.710 --> 12:38.710
Up there,
near the top.

12:38.710 --> 12:39.880
( meows )

12:39.880 --> 12:41.920
It'll be all right,
Señor Whiskers.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.500
Where's the royal wizard?

12:43.500 --> 12:46.040
It's okay.
I can get him down.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.290
Wait. I left my notebook
with the spell at the palace.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.670
Señor Whiskers!

12:52.670 --> 12:55.000
Uh, I'm pretty sure
I remember the spell.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.040
- ( yowling )
- Canaza!

13:00.540 --> 13:02.880
- Ha!
- ( meowing )

13:02.880 --> 13:04.790
You did it!

13:04.790 --> 13:07.420
Your first day,
and you're already
a great wizard.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.710
Well, I don't know
about that.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.710
But I got the spell right,
my first real spell!

13:11.710 --> 13:13.080
( squeals )

13:13.080 --> 13:14.920
Way to go, Olivia!

13:14.920 --> 13:18.210
Oh, if only fixing the well
was that easy.

13:18.210 --> 13:19.460
Maybe Olivia
knows a spell.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.750
I don't think...
Do you?

13:21.750 --> 13:24.750
Well, I did learn
an abundance spell today.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.790
Maybe I can use it
to make more water.

13:28.830 --> 13:31.790
Okay, what was
that spell again?

13:31.790 --> 13:33.750
Moyotzi!

13:35.790 --> 13:37.750
The water's rising!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.040
It worked!

13:41.120 --> 13:43.580
My daughter
the wizard.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.710
Okay, we're here
to fix the well.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.670
Oh, thank you,
Your Majesty,

13:49.670 --> 13:52.500
but Olivia
already took care of it.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.040
- Olivia?
- With a magic spell.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.210
A what?!

13:56.210 --> 13:57.290
( nervous giggle )

13:57.290 --> 13:58.750
Olivia?

13:58.750 --> 13:59.790
Hi.

13:59.790 --> 14:02.790
Hm. I better
take a look.

14:02.790 --> 14:05.250
You promised
not to touch anything.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.380
I know, but
Señor Whiskers

14:07.380 --> 14:09.500
was stuck in a tree,
and I didn't know
what else to do,

14:09.500 --> 14:11.120
so I borrowed
the tamborita,

14:11.120 --> 14:12.710
and everything's
fixed now, see.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.250
( meows )

14:14.250 --> 14:15.750
Well, I don't know
about that.

14:17.080 --> 14:20.120
Something's not right
with this water.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.620
What do you mean,
not right?

14:22.620 --> 14:23.790
What is that?

14:25.750 --> 14:27.830
Olivia, what spell
did you use?

14:27.830 --> 14:30.710
- Moyotzi.
- No, it's mocachi.

14:30.710 --> 14:33.670
You mixed up the abundance
and spirit spells.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.920
Meaning
what exactly?

14:35.920 --> 14:37.120
She conjured
a water spirit.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.460
( growling )

14:52.670 --> 14:54.880
What is it doing?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.500
It's growing. The more
water it sucks up,

14:56.500 --> 14:57.710
the bigger it gets.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.540
How do we get
rid of it?

15:02.540 --> 15:04.580
I have a vanishing spell
that should do the trick.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.540
What are you
waiting for? Do it!

15:06.540 --> 15:07.960
I don't know it
by heart.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.710
It's in a spell book
at my house.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.210
Take the coach.
Hurry.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.500
It's going after
Mateo.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.120
We have to help him.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.790
Andale, andale!

15:27.670 --> 15:30.500
We could take my cart.
This way.

15:32.460 --> 15:35.000
- Vamonos!
- Go, Churro!

15:58.040 --> 16:00.750
Come on, we have
to push the cart out.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.420
Vanishing spell,
vanishing spell.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.120
Where are you?

16:24.330 --> 16:26.420
No, no, no, no!

16:30.790 --> 16:33.080
( laughing )

16:41.250 --> 16:42.920
Oh, I see what
you're trying to do.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.790
No way I'm letting you
ruin the spell.

17:09.830 --> 17:11.420
Mateo.

17:11.420 --> 17:13.920
Don't worry.
Everything is under control.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.540
Desparci!

17:19.920 --> 17:22.170
Why isn't
the spell working?

17:22.170 --> 17:23.750
The water spirit's
too big.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.330
My spell
isn't strong enough.

17:34.670 --> 17:36.880
Oh, no.
He saw the bay.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.880
That's good,
right?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.290
Maybe he'll
go out to sea.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.120
Or maybe he'll suck up
all the water

17:42.120 --> 17:43.710
in the bay
and become enormous.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.500
And unstoppable.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.670
All I wanted to do
was help,

17:47.670 --> 17:49.750
but I didn't listen,

17:49.750 --> 17:51.960
and now I've
hurt everyone.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.750
I'm sorry.

17:53.750 --> 17:57.380
Olivia, you shouldn't
have tried to do
magic on your own.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.920
But I was wrong, too.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.790
I was distracted
during our lesson,

18:02.790 --> 18:05.540
and then I left you
alone in the workshop.

18:05.540 --> 18:09.040
( sighs ) I guess I still
have a lot to learn
about teaching.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.290
Well, I'm glad
both of you
learned your lesson,

18:11.290 --> 18:13.830
but I'd still like to try
and stop the water monster,

18:13.830 --> 18:14.880
if you don't mind.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.540
I tried.

18:16.540 --> 18:17.750
I don't know
what other spell to use.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.880
Wait.
It's made of water.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.750
A liquid.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.580
So turning it into
a solid can stop it.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.380
Uh, like I did today.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.170
You're right.

18:28.170 --> 18:30.210
But we don't need
alchemy to make water solid.

18:30.210 --> 18:34.120
We just need
a freezing spell.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.960
I'm pretty sure I saw one
while I was looking

18:35.960 --> 18:38.710
for the other spell.
Here it is.

18:38.710 --> 18:40.580
I'll get the coach.
We can still catch it.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.620
Hang on, guys.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.880
Hey, you.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.080
Conglari!

19:06.880 --> 19:08.460
You got him!

19:12.210 --> 19:15.000
Not quite.
I only froze the outside.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.380
Ugh! The spell
isn't strong enough.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.120
Do you have
another spell?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.580
No. What I need
is another wizard.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.120
BOTH: What?!

19:28.120 --> 19:29.880
If two wizards
do a spell

19:29.880 --> 19:33.040
at the same time,
it makes the spell
more powerful.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.330
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

19:35.330 --> 19:37.670
Yeah. What if
I mess it up again?

19:37.670 --> 19:39.880
You won't, because
I'm gonna teach you

19:39.880 --> 19:42.080
exactly what to do,
step by step.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.540
So...

19:44.540 --> 19:45.880
take the tamborita...

19:45.880 --> 19:47.580
apprentice.

19:51.710 --> 19:53.920
( people screaming )

19:58.580 --> 20:00.120
It's almost
at the harbor.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.920
Do the spell.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.460
Okay, Olivia,
aim your tamborita,

20:03.460 --> 20:04.830
wand arm straight,

20:04.830 --> 20:07.460
get your other hand
into position.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.080
The spell is
Conglari.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.880
- Say it.
- Conglari!

20:10.880 --> 20:12.880
Perfect.
Now hit it
as hard as you can,

20:12.880 --> 20:14.830
because that makes
the spell more powerful,

20:14.830 --> 20:16.580
and we need
all the power we can get.

20:25.330 --> 20:26.620
Mateo!

20:28.080 --> 20:29.500
BOTH: Conglari!

20:41.120 --> 20:44.120
It's frozen solid.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.330
Way to cast a spell,
apprentice.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.880
But what do we
do with it now?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.920
I have an idea.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.080
Olivia, Solaza
on three.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.580
Solaza.
Got it.

20:56.580 --> 20:59.080
One, two, three.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.580
Solaza!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.290
I think this is
the first time it's snowed

21:12.290 --> 21:13.960
in Avalor City.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.080
Olivia!

21:16.080 --> 21:18.040
You stopped
the water spirit?

21:18.040 --> 21:19.540
We did it
together.

21:19.540 --> 21:20.960
I can't believe it.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.250
My daughter,
a real wizard.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.040
Not yet.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.710
Right now,
I'm still an apprentice.

21:27.710 --> 21:29.750
Right?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.710
Yes. As long as you follow
the rules from now on,

21:31.710 --> 21:35.250
and help me clean up
the mess the water spirit made.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.880
I will.

21:38.120 --> 21:42.500
Well, teacher, I think
we need to cut class
short today,

21:42.500 --> 21:43.500
on account of
the weather.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.880
Snow day, everyone!

21:45.880 --> 21:48.290
All right.
Come on, Señor Whiskers!

21:48.290 --> 21:50.000
( meows )

21:50.000 --> 21:52.290
Ooh, do you wanna
build a snowman?

21:52.290 --> 21:53.620
BOTH: No!

21:53.620 --> 21:55.500
Not a magic one.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.790
Just the regular kind.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.710
Oh. Okay.
