{\an8}What happened?

01:00.340 --> 01:02.780
{\an8}Rita told Weilan
to make herself at home.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.459
We live here, too.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.940
I don't think Weilan realizes that.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.940
That girl needs a serious talking to.

01:10.020 --> 01:12.300
As much as I'd love
to stay and help...

01:13.420 --> 01:14.660
I have to go to work.

01:15.860 --> 01:16.860
Morning.

01:16.940 --> 01:20.060
Hi. So how did you sleep?

01:20.140 --> 01:22.740
Ah, great.
It's so quiet down here.

01:22.820 --> 01:24.660
Not like Shanghai.

01:24.740 --> 01:26.420
Oh, what's Shanghai like?

01:27.300 --> 01:30.860
It's big and modern.
It's a city of the future.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.780
-I would love to go there.
-[chuckles]

01:32.860 --> 01:34.020
Wouldn't you, Ondina?

01:34.100 --> 01:35.820
I thought you were going to work.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.580
-You work?
-At the Marine Park.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.460
I still can't understand
why you have that job.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.220
If you want to see dolphins,
take a swim in the sea.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.860
You should come.

01:44.940 --> 01:47.580
Ondina will tell you how to get there.
Right, Ondina?

01:48.740 --> 01:50.820
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.460
I love this place. [chuckles]

02:02.540 --> 02:04.620
It's so much bigger
than my apartment back home.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.780
Yeah, we loved it, too...

02:06.260 --> 02:07.500
when it was clean.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.700
Morning.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.860
-Weilan, everything okay?
-Mmm-hmm. Great, thanks, Rita.

02:15.940 --> 02:18.420
[Rita] Okay. Well, I have to fly,
so I'll see you after.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.700
Bye.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.060
Rita!

02:33.140 --> 02:35.500
How long will she be staying
in our grotto?

02:35.580 --> 02:38.260
[stammers] Uh, Weilan will be here
for as long as she's here.

02:38.340 --> 02:40.940
And please remember
it's my grotto, not yours.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.580
Sorry.

02:42.660 --> 02:46.860
[sighs] Look, Weilan has been through
some really tough times.

02:46.940 --> 02:48.900
I was hoping you and Mimmi
would make her feel welcome.

02:48.980 --> 02:50.780
She endangered our pod.

02:50.860 --> 02:52.460
[scoffs]

02:52.540 --> 02:53.980
I don't have time
to talk about this now.

02:54.060 --> 02:55.740
Just keep an eye on her.

02:55.820 --> 02:56.980
Make sure
she doesn't get into trouble.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.780
-What?
-Please?

02:58.860 --> 02:59.980
[Ondina sighs]

03:03.100 --> 03:04.380
[whimpers softly]

03:10.540 --> 03:11.900
Weilan?

03:29.340 --> 03:31.780
This isn't something
I expected to see.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.420
What?

03:34.500 --> 03:37.820
A merman sitting in a café with a juice.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.700
I thought you'd be out riding a whale,
or summoning up a storm.

03:41.780 --> 03:42.980
[chuckles]

03:43.060 --> 03:46.140
Well, you ride one whale,
you've, uh... ridden them all.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.820
Bro, bro, bro?
Can you believe it?

03:50.900 --> 03:52.660
I just called the police
about the sea monster,

03:52.740 --> 03:54.020
and they laughed at me.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.700
-What did you tell them exactly?
-Well, what do you think?

03:56.780 --> 03:59.500
I told them that a monster came up
out of the water and attacked our boat.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.380
-But they didn't believe you?
-No.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.940
That's why I need you to call them
and back up our story.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.900
Oh, and make sure you sound
as scared as you did last night.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.820
Hey, you were just as scared as I was.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.140
Me? Nah. [scoffs]

04:12.220 --> 04:13.980
Just a little excited, that's all.

04:14.980 --> 04:17.820
-So, you gonna help me, or what?
-Maybe we didn't see a sea monster.

04:19.100 --> 04:23.460
Are you... are you kidding?
You were standing right next to me.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.340
I don't really know what we saw.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.940
[stammers] You know what? Fine.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.460
Okay? But don't come running to me
for a loan when I'm rich,

04:32.540 --> 04:34.220
because I reckon there's a buck in this.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.260
I'll try the Marine Park.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.020
Maybe they'll listen.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.860
How come you're not hanging
with the tail gang?

04:43.580 --> 04:46.300
Ondina and I didn't exactly hit it off.

04:47.060 --> 04:48.460
Ondina can be prickly.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.780
-Giant sea urchin prickly.
-[David] Zac?

04:51.740 --> 04:55.140
David, this is Weilan.
The girl we told you about.

04:55.220 --> 04:57.220
Sorry about throwing you around the jetty.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.220
Never mind that.
Joe's obsessed with the sea monster.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.820
-He's going to the authorities about it.
-[Zac] Relax.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.620
No one is going to believe him.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.300
If you say so.

05:13.420 --> 05:16.140
There you go.
And you can play with those in the bath.

05:16.220 --> 05:17.860
Thank you.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.540
Just make sure you don't touch it
on the forehead.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.780
Real dolphins don't like that.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.220
Chris!

05:25.980 --> 05:26.980
When did you get back?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.580
-Yesterday.
-[boy clears throat]

05:28.660 --> 05:31.340
Sorry. Mimmi, this is Karl.
Karl's new here.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.220
He trained in San Diego as well,
but his specialty is sharks.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.340
So you're the famous Mimmi.
I've heard a lot about you.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.820
All of it good, I promise.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.500
Hey, uh, notice anything?

05:41.580 --> 05:43.900
You're a dolphin trainer.
I knew you could do it.

05:43.980 --> 05:46.300
Without you I wouldn't have been able
to get into the training course.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.540
Well, I was just happy to help.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.180
We better get going.
Don't want to be late on our first day.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.260
I'll catch up.

05:53.700 --> 05:54.740
It's good to see you.

05:54.820 --> 05:57.460
You've got to tell me
about San Diego sometime.

05:57.540 --> 06:00.100
-I want to hear all about it.
-[Karl] Chris, are you coming?

06:05.860 --> 06:07.140
Thank you.

06:10.460 --> 06:11.540
[Evie] Hi, Weilan.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.820
Just browsing,
or are you after something special?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.900
Seeing as I'm going to be here
for a while,

06:15.980 --> 06:18.300
I thought I should start dressing
like the natives.

06:19.180 --> 06:20.740
You have some really nice stuff.

06:20.820 --> 06:22.740
I try and keep the natives happy.

06:23.940 --> 06:26.900
-Mind if I try this on?
-Sure. The change room's in there.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.860
Hi, Ondina.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.260
[sighs] Have you seen
our houseguest?

06:44.340 --> 06:45.540
[Evie ] You mean Weilan?

06:45.620 --> 06:47.820
[Ondina] Rita asked me to keep
an eye on her, but she ran out on me.

06:48.620 --> 06:51.660
[sighs] I have no idea what goes on
in that girl's brain,

06:51.740 --> 06:52.820
assuming she has one.

06:52.900 --> 06:53.940
Uh, Ondina--

06:54.020 --> 06:56.100
You should see
what she's done to the grotto.

06:56.180 --> 06:57.980
-I can't wait till she's gone.
-Um--

06:58.060 --> 07:00.660
If she comes in,
just tell her I'm looking for her.

07:11.020 --> 07:14.340
For your information...
I do have a brain.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.460
Oh, great.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.540
Look, I know you're not happy
about me being here.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.140
-You got that right.
-We got off to a bad start,

07:22.220 --> 07:24.500
but that doesn't mean
we have to be enemies.

07:25.780 --> 07:28.660
You should give me a chance.
We could have fun together.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.420
I'm not interested in fun.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.420
See, right there is your problem.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.380
I'm more concerned
with protecting the pod.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.020
Something a real mermaid
would understand.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.340
Hey!

07:40.980 --> 07:43.100
I am a real mermaid.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.060
A real mermaid
would never endanger other mermaids.

07:46.140 --> 07:49.060
-Meaning?
-Meaning that I couldn't help but notice

07:49.140 --> 07:51.100
that your arrival
coincided with the dragon's.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.820
-You think I brought it?
-Didn't you?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.780
Well, this has been fun.

07:57.860 --> 08:00.180
Now I'm off to teach a class
of real mermaids.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.460
[dolphin clicking]

08:05.540 --> 08:06.980
[Dr. Ross] Chris?

08:14.300 --> 08:15.740
There's probably nothing to this,

08:15.820 --> 08:18.540
but I want you and Karl to go out to Mako
and do some diving.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.620
Just... take a look around for me.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.820
No problem.
What are we looking for?

08:24.820 --> 08:27.180
You don't think Joe really saw
a sea monster?

08:27.260 --> 08:30.540
Of course he didn't,
but he obviously saw something.

08:30.620 --> 08:32.780
You know, scientists believe
that the Loch Ness Monster

08:32.860 --> 08:35.700
is a plesiosaur
living inside caves in the loch.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.780
I'm just saying, there's caves under Mako.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.740
I'm pretty sure there's nothing there.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.780
Yeah, but you can't be certain, can you?

08:46.660 --> 08:50.660
Sharks are most often active at night,
which is when it's best to feed.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.020
Surprisingly, they're a bit hard to see
in the dark.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.260
[kids murmuring indistinctly]

08:55.340 --> 08:58.380
So we use this heat-sensing equipment
to observe them.

08:58.460 --> 08:59.660
If you were a shark...

09:00.500 --> 09:01.700
this is what you'd look like.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.420
[kid 1] Wow!
[kid 2] Whoa!

09:06.500 --> 09:08.660
Sorry, guys.
That's it for today.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.460
-Thanks for coming.
-That was awesome.

09:10.540 --> 09:12.740
-That was great.
-[kids talking indistinctly]

09:16.220 --> 09:18.900
How would you feel about
getting out into the real ocean?

09:19.500 --> 09:20.860
Sure. What's up?

09:21.900 --> 09:23.700
We're going on a monster hunt.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.860
-Wow!
-Oh!

09:32.940 --> 09:35.660
[all] Wow!

09:35.740 --> 09:37.420
-Oh, my goodness.
-This is amazing.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.860
[exclaiming]

09:38.940 --> 09:41.780
The moon pool
is the magical heart of Mako...

09:41.860 --> 09:45.620
so I suppose it's appropriate
that you should have your lessons in here.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.940
Thanks, Ondina.
This is awesome.

09:55.860 --> 09:59.860
Well, according to that guy's coordinates,
this is where he saw it.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.060
I still think this is pointless.

10:01.140 --> 10:04.220
Karl, global warming
is affecting ocean temperatures.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.540
You know, water currents are changing.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.660
This could bring up
all kinds of stuff from the deep.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.620
[scoffing] Yeah, yeah.
Dream on.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.580
[Mimmi] Glad you came!
Ondina told you how to get here?

10:15.660 --> 10:16.660
[Weilan] It was Zac.

10:17.620 --> 10:21.580
Ondina and I aren't exactly getting on.

10:21.660 --> 10:24.540
Ondina takes some time
to warm to people.

10:24.620 --> 10:25.660
But don't worry.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.460
In a couple of days
it'll be like you're old friends.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.940
More like a couple of centuries.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.060
Ondina takes some getting used to,
but she has a good heart.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.380
You could've fooled me.

10:36.340 --> 10:39.580
I was trying to be friendly,
but she blew me off.

10:40.780 --> 10:42.500
Said I wasn't a real mermaid.

10:44.700 --> 10:45.940
Let's go get a drink.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.140
[Weilan] So once we knew
there was no way of stopping the dragon,

10:53.220 --> 10:56.380
the pod fled to
the only safe place... land.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.020
Did you ever look for them?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.980
China is a big country and...

11:01.900 --> 11:03.380
my grandmother's old.

11:04.340 --> 11:06.820
So we stayed in Shanghai and...

11:06.900 --> 11:08.700
I pretty much became a land girl.

11:08.780 --> 11:11.180
I can't imagine how hard
it must have been for you,

11:11.260 --> 11:12.340
losing your pod.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.340
It was... [chuckles] awful.

11:18.940 --> 11:22.580
And that's why,
despite what Ondina thinks,

11:22.660 --> 11:24.860
I would never do anything
to hurt your pod.

11:24.940 --> 11:28.340
I'll have a word with her
and try and get her to lighten up.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.860
So I should try talking to her in...
oh, about a year?

11:31.940 --> 11:34.380
-[both chuckle]
-Well, I have to get back to work.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.220
-Thanks for listening.
-Sure.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.340
What are you up to now?

11:43.420 --> 11:46.660
Well, Evie has a couple
of really nice dresses I want to try on.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.860
Hmm.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.980
Remember, we're gonna have to stay
in sight of each other.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.420
Unlikely as it seems,
what if we find something?

11:55.780 --> 11:58.300
Get pictures and we get out of there.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.340
-Works for me.
-[air hissing]

12:05.980 --> 12:08.620
Each of you is special.
Do you know why?

12:10.660 --> 12:12.820
You're special
because you're part of the pod.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.740
Your powers are strongest
when you work together.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.660
We already did water balls.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.980
Yes, I know.

12:23.940 --> 12:24.980
Now catch!

12:25.060 --> 12:26.220
[gasps]

12:26.940 --> 12:29.660
Good. Now pass it on.

12:36.620 --> 12:37.740
[chuckles]

12:39.260 --> 12:41.580
[whistling]

12:41.660 --> 12:43.740
You're in a good mood.

12:43.820 --> 12:46.580
I just spoke to the guy
in charge of the Marine Park.

12:46.660 --> 12:49.540
He sent two of his best guys
to check it out.

12:50.340 --> 12:53.300
-When are they going?
-They're out there right now.

12:53.380 --> 12:56.020
Yeah, with some sort of
heat-sensing equipment.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.620
So if that thing is down there,
they're gonna find it.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.580
[chuckles]

13:04.660 --> 13:05.740
[whispers] Weilan!

13:05.820 --> 13:07.660
Hey, David. What's up?

13:07.740 --> 13:10.500
-The sea monster we saw...
-The water dragon?

13:10.580 --> 13:11.620
Do you think it's still
hanging around Mako?

13:11.700 --> 13:12.820
Mmm-mmm.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.660
The dragon only forms
under the full moon,

13:14.740 --> 13:16.220
so it's safe for the moment.

13:17.660 --> 13:19.180
Why do you ask?

13:21.340 --> 13:22.540
Well, that was a total bust.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.540
We can't give up yet.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.780
I don't see any sea monster.
Do you?

13:30.260 --> 13:31.660
Maybe it doesn't want to be found.

13:32.780 --> 13:33.820
Where would it go?

13:35.820 --> 13:37.380
Well, there's caves under Mako.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.060
Fine.

13:43.340 --> 13:45.180
[engine starting]

13:51.860 --> 13:53.580
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.420
[Weilan] Mimmi!

13:56.340 --> 13:57.500
[Mimmi] Any luck with the dresses?

13:57.580 --> 14:00.140
Some people from the Marine Park
are going to Mako to look for the dragon.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.420
I know, but we don't have to worry.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.420
You said the dragon won't appear
until the next full moon.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.900
But Ondina's out there teaching.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.060
Mermaids can cloak.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.700
They've got some sort of gear
that can sense heat.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.380
Mermaids might be able to cloak,
but their bodies are still warm.

14:13.860 --> 14:14.900
[exhales sharply]

14:14.980 --> 14:18.260
[Chris] The caves of Mako are uncharted,
so be careful.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.780
Might take the heat sensor,
see if I can pick anything up.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.300
-Mind if I borrow it?
-Go for it.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.420
But if anything happens to it,
you're paying.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.540
[Chris chuckles]

14:29.620 --> 14:30.740
[air hissing]

14:34.220 --> 14:35.980
[all laughing]

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
Good work.

14:42.060 --> 14:44.180
Don't worry.
It just takes practice.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.500
Have another go.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.860
You've done very well today.
You should all be proud of yourselves.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.340
Off you go.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.300
-[all] Thank you, Ondina.
-See ya!

15:35.380 --> 15:37.220
-Bye!
-Bye. Thank you.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.940
[sighs]

16:00.140 --> 16:02.140
This is where Ondina teaches.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.340
Is there anywhere else she might be?

18:28.980 --> 18:31.500
-Are you okay?
-No.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.540
There was a land boy in the moon pool.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.860
-Did he see you?
-I cloaked, but...

18:36.940 --> 18:39.620
he kept looking at me
as if he knew I was there.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.140
Something was in that cave.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.740
-Did you get a picture?
-No, it was...

18:44.820 --> 18:46.660
It was invisible.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.260
You saw something invisible
in the cave.

18:48.340 --> 18:50.300
I felt something brush past me
when I swam out.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.380
Did you see something?

18:51.460 --> 18:54.220
You mean the invisible thing?
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

18:55.740 --> 18:57.500
I'm going back in for another look.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.300
I'm too low on air to dive again,
and you can't dive without me.

19:03.780 --> 19:06.180
Sorry, buddy, but we're heading home.

19:19.340 --> 19:22.140
-[Mimmi] It looks like they're leaving.
-It can't be soon enough for me.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.860
They came looking for a dragon, remember?

19:24.940 --> 19:28.140
-[Ondina] So?
-So, what if they keep looking?

19:28.220 --> 19:29.780
There's a chance they could find the pod.

19:30.660 --> 19:33.180
Weilan's right.
We can't risk them coming back.

19:33.260 --> 19:36.100
So what do you suggest?
Sink their boat?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.540
I think we can be
a bit more subtle than that.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.460
I'm starving.
Fancy a burger on the way home?

19:45.300 --> 19:46.380
Yeah.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.100
[bubbling]

20:02.740 --> 20:06.060
-What is that?
-Some kind of current?

20:29.140 --> 20:31.380
[all laughing]

20:33.940 --> 20:35.980
I guess we've found the sea monster.

20:39.580 --> 20:42.580
[Mimmi chuckles]
I think we scared them off.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.980
No, no, no, no.
I know what I saw, all right?

20:53.740 --> 20:57.100
That was the Marine Park.
They think I saw a waterspout.

20:57.180 --> 21:00.300
-Unbelievable!
-Well, maybe they're right.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.540
I saw a sea monster, and so did you!

21:03.620 --> 21:06.100
Waterspouts are common
in subtropical areas,

21:06.180 --> 21:07.940
especially at this time of year.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.180
We did see something.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.020
-Didn't we?
-Mmm...

21:14.100 --> 21:18.420
diesel fumes can make your head spin,
and they certainly made me nauseous.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.660
A waterspout?

21:25.700 --> 21:26.820
[exhales]

21:30.820 --> 21:33.500
[sighs] Did you clean up?

21:33.580 --> 21:35.260
It was like this when I arrived.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.980
Weilan must have done it.

21:37.660 --> 21:40.780
You should be nice to her.
She's had it tough.

21:40.860 --> 21:42.500
And we haven't?

21:42.580 --> 21:44.700
Well, you said she was selfish.

21:44.780 --> 21:47.380
She didn't have to help us today,
but she did.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.460
That doesn't sound selfish to me.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.660
-How did you go with Chris?
-It's all good.

21:58.620 --> 21:59.620
He won't be going back to Mako.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.940
-[all laugh]
-Score one for the mermaids.

22:04.660 --> 22:06.260
The grotto looks nice.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.260
Rita explained that you live here, too.

22:10.340 --> 22:12.180
Sorry about the mess. [chuckles]

22:14.620 --> 22:16.180
Anyone hungry?

22:16.260 --> 22:18.420
I got this fresh from the café.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.580
Mmm! Looks good.

22:21.660 --> 22:23.060
Try some, Ondina.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.300
The waterspout?

22:26.380 --> 22:27.500
That was clever.

22:28.660 --> 22:29.660
"Clever"?

22:30.260 --> 22:32.100
-You heard.
-[chuckles]

22:33.700 --> 22:35.620
Was that a thank you?

22:35.700 --> 22:36.860
Pretty big one, actually.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.540
[all chuckle]

22:39.460 --> 22:41.300
Mmm... lobster tail!

22:41.380 --> 22:43.420
Hey! That's the best bit.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.820
I know.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.260
Well, I hope you're gonna share.

22:46.340 --> 22:48.660
[chuckles] Make me.
