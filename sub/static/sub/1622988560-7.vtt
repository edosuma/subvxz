00:17.143 --> 00:19.186
- Buffed your boots.
- [Bosch] Thanks.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.147
Tying my tie.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.277
You look nice.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.405
Thanks. So do you.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.990
That's a good suit on you.

00:32.742 --> 00:34.702
Worn it way too many times.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.124
It's a beautiful day.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.464
January in L.A. Can't beat it.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.050
Should be raining.

00:50.134 --> 00:52.970
Cold, wet, miserable.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.308
California funerals.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.061
Ought to be raining.

01:01.145 --> 01:03.063
You okay?

01:04.690 --> 01:06.734
Let's go.

[chatter continues]

01:59.537 --> 02:00.788
I fixed you a plate.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.582
No, thanks. Not hungry.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.584
Gotta eat sometime, Dad.

02:05.668 --> 02:08.337
I know. I will. Later.
I promise.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.882
Bella Winslow.
Donna's daughter.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.759
Yes, we know.
Maddie Bosch.

02:13.843 --> 02:14.969
This is my dad.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.846
Harry Bosch.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.014
I'm so sorry.

02:19.098 --> 02:21.141
Your mother was
an extraordinary woman.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.978
- Thank you for coming.
- [Maddie] Of course.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.646
Lovely service.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.023
It was, wasn't it?
It's such a gorgeous day.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.526
It feels like it should be
raining cats and dogs.

02:30.609 --> 02:31.861
I know what you mean.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.238
My mother spoke
very fondly of you.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.907
- I was very fond of her.
- So she said.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.911
I'm grateful to you.
You put a spring in her step

02:40.995 --> 02:43.038
and roses in her cheeks.

02:43.122 --> 02:45.040
It was mutual.

02:45.124 --> 02:46.625
I'll miss her.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.005
Thank you again for coming.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.256
Call me.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.258
We should get coffee
before I leave town.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.342
I'd like that.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.516
- Don't say it.
- What?

03:02.600 --> 03:04.476
Whatever you were going to say.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.023
Wouldn't dream of it.

03:14.153 --> 03:16.196
So Donna's daughter.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.616
- You should give her a call.
- Bella?

03:20.743 --> 03:22.494
Maybe I will.

03:22.578 --> 03:26.165
- We have a lot in common.
- Yeah.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.083
Did you call the hospital
this morning?

03:28.167 --> 03:30.169
I did.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.047
She's stable. Still critical.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.467
When will I get to see her?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.344
When she's conscious.

03:41.347 --> 03:42.973

[Billets] A broken surveillance
camera isn't much use.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.341
[Patterson] Well,
I thought it was a deterrent.

04:59.425 --> 05:02.261
Mm, kids, maybe. But not anyone
who knows what they're doing.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.971
Been planning to get it fixed.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.390
Okay, when you do,
position the monitor

05:06.473 --> 05:08.392
so that your customers can
see that they're on camera.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
- That is a deterrent.
- Gotcha.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.229
I would also recommend
an audible alarm

05:12.312 --> 05:14.982
- with a panic button.
- I-I've got an alarm.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.943
Panic button is key.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.445
First, fix the cameras.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.822
You've got a lot of
nice merchandise in here.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.240
Oh? You see anything you like?

05:23.323 --> 05:26.118
- Earrings are my weakness.
- Ah.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.955
- Oh, no, no, no. Not today.
- I'll give you a nice price.

05:30.039 --> 05:32.750
Oh, for me,
full price is a good price.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.836
So if there isn't anything more,
Mr. Patterson,

05:35.919 --> 05:37.337
I've got a couple more
stops to make.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.049
Ah. Well, I appreciate you
stopping by, Lieutenant.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.217
That's what we're here for.
To protect and serve.

- Fowkkes murder book?
- Yup.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.030
- Got a record?
- Clean sheet.

Where'd you find his prints?

06:05.240 --> 06:08.243

Where's his hidey hole?

the VA sends his pension.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.461
I'll reach out to Sin City PD.
Get those warrants started.

- From extortion to ownership.
- American dream.

06:34.645 --> 06:38.941
Mm. And get this:
rental properties.

In gentrifying neighborhoods.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.862
East Hollywood, Thai Town,
Echo Park... all legit.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.492
Legit if you ignore
where the money comes from.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.078
Feds are turning a blind eye.
Why?

06:52.121 --> 06:55.499
I tried, Bosch. I really did.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.044
All I got was "need to know"
and "you don't need to know."

06:59.128 --> 07:00.796
And, "if you know
what's good for you,

07:00.879 --> 07:02.506

- [chuckles softly]

07:04.800 --> 07:06.927

in high places.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.720

A $150,000 consulting fee
for a mayoral campaign

07:39.751 --> 07:42.504
doesn't strike me as unusual.
Or egregious.

07:42.588 --> 07:46.049
It isn't a consulting firm, sir.
If you'll turn the page.

07:48.177 --> 07:52.097
It's a dummy corporation.
Owned by Henry Myers.

07:52.181 --> 07:55.392
Henry Myers,
head of Federated L.A. Labor?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.103
The very same.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.938
He backed Lopez.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.440
Now I know why.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.317
He had a lot of incentive.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.320
Why'd the Bureau
drop their investigation?

08:06.403 --> 08:07.738
Last page, sir.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.371
"Insufficient evidence
to prove a quid pro quo."

Touchy stuff.
First-term, first Latina mayor?

08:21.084 --> 08:22.544
They'd want to make damn sure

08:22.628 --> 08:24.254
she was dirty
before going ahead.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.381
So they shelved it.

- Good work, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.

I put a rush on it.
Call you soon as I hear.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.032
Okay. I'm on my way to Vegas.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.867
Road trip. Me and Bennett.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.285
What's in Vegas?

08:55.369 --> 08:57.329
Charles Kipps, the hit man.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.122

08:59.206 --> 09:00.499

09:03.252 --> 09:05.212
I'll reach out.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.130
When you toss his place,
keep an eye out

09:07.214 --> 09:09.967
for any connection
between Kipps and Willy Datz.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.594
The mobster? Will do.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.805
- And, Jimmy?
- Yeah?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.598

09:23.814 --> 09:25.607
You didn't know
Peña was their CI.

09:25.691 --> 09:26.942
Fuck no.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.568
Feds don't tell us jack.

09:28.652 --> 09:29.903
You sure?

09:29.987 --> 09:31.488
They let him
launder his drug money

09:31.571 --> 09:34.283
buying fucking taco trucks
and run-down real estate.

09:34.366 --> 09:37.077
They disappear Alvarez before
he can finger Peña for arson.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.413

no question.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.998

That's a tough break, brother.

You'll never get to Peña.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.380
Don't count on it.
I need to talk to Trejo.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.382
- Trejo won't talk.
- Something I want to show him.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.093

the cloak-and-dagger.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.161
Well, of course not.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.621
It'd never be something
that trivial.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.916
Well, feel free to reassure me
with your righteous outrage.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.128
This is pushback.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.671
The two police officers?

10:29.755 --> 10:30.839
Exactly.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.341
So, where did it come from?

10:32.424 --> 10:33.508
The allegation.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.260
Civilian complaint.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.155

11:13.632 --> 11:15.050
I've converted Antonio,
you know.

- To jazz?
- Jazz on vinyl.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.639
Doing the Lord's work.
Proud of you.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.228
Yeah, I think moving in together

11:26.311 --> 11:29.106
and taking time off school
is going to be good for me.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.067
I think I need time to think.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.819
A lot of thinking.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.321
Think you'll get a job?

11:36.405 --> 11:37.823
Eventually.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.241
Once Honey goes back to work.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.159
Could be a while.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.411
If ever.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.079
I know.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.581
Antonio's okay with this?

11:46.665 --> 11:49.418
What about money?
Your share of the rent?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.461
We'll work it out.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.840
Okay, you know,
the monthly survivor payments

11:54.923 --> 11:57.008
- end once you leave school.
- I know.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.593
I have a bit of it saved.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.762
- Plus what Mom left for me.
- Okay, Madeline,

12:00.846 --> 12:03.473
your mother intended that
to be used for emergencies.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.684
This feels like
an emergency, Dad.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.893
It does?

12:06.977 --> 12:08.186
After everything
that's happened?

12:08.270 --> 12:09.980
Definitely.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.359
Okay.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.071
I get that.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.952
I think I just need time.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.874
Figure out what I'm doing
with my life.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.044
Okay.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
Credit and debit card numbers.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.605
Sounds like Señor Peña's
snug as a bug in a rug

12:51.688 --> 12:53.773
in some Motel Fed.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.484
I'm a sucker for
a wild-goose chase

12:55.567 --> 12:56.776
and a fool's errand.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.320
Long shot, I know.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.156
Well, for the
Little Tamale Girl,

13:01.239 --> 13:02.908
no turn unstoned.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.826
Appreciate it, brother.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.873
You know that's a spoonerism?
No turn unstoned?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.583
I know what a spoonerism is.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.959
That was intentional.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.630
Could be a sign
of cognitive decline.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.216
Decline this.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.099
[phone ringing]

13:30.477 --> 13:33.146
Dylan, any luck?

13:33.230 --> 13:36.191
Great. Send it through now.
Thanks.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.944
- Hit man's burner come back?
- Finally.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.494
Morning of, Kipps got a text
from an unknown number.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.120
"Is it done?"

13:49.204 --> 13:51.414
Received downtown Los Angeles.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.751
About the time
he had Donna at gunpoint.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.920
Sorry, man.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.838
Jimmy found
the hit man's burner,

13:58.922 --> 14:01.508
we texted
that unknown number back.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.760
"It's over."

14:03.843 --> 14:05.387
Right.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.055
Where was that text received?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.392
- Las Vegas.
- Willy Datz?

14:10.475 --> 14:11.643
That'd be my guess.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.853
So the first text, "Is it done?"

14:13.937 --> 14:15.438
That's Datz asking Kipps

14:15.522 --> 14:17.190
if he'd killed Fowkkes
and Sobel yet.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.608
And Maddie.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.403
We had an understanding.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.862
I made no promises.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.281
The status quo would continue

14:24.364 --> 14:25.865
in exchange for my support.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.369
I'm sorry if you misconstrued
our conversations.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.954
Henry Myers.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.794
I'll bet he's just
the tip of the iceberg.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.299
Who else bought
a ticket to the ball?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.175
What do you want?

14:44.259 --> 14:46.469
Only what's owed me.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.180
I look forward to
five more years

14:49.264 --> 14:50.432
of working with you
for the betterment

14:50.515 --> 14:52.934
of the people
of this great city.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.447
L.T.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.994
Norris and Leonard.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.580
What a pair of weasels.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.498
Thanks, Mank.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.921
Now what?

15:22.005 --> 15:23.882
I'm not sure.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.468
Cooper?

15:26.551 --> 15:29.137
Where investigations go to die.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.307
- Take it outside the chain?
- That's risky.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.184
Bureaucratic blowback, I'm...

15:34.267 --> 15:36.227
Well, I'm not going to sit back
and let these two pricks

15:36.311 --> 15:38.229
destroy my reputation.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.939
I get it. I know.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.399
Sorry, L.T.,

15:41.483 --> 15:42.859
a couple of suits
in the parking lot

15:42.942 --> 15:44.944
tossing your city ride.

15:51.660 --> 15:52.577
All right, whoa.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.496
Slow your roll, guys, all right?

15:54.579 --> 15:57.457
- I will handle this.
- Out of my way, Mank.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.250
After you, Alphonse.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.798
[indistinct chatter]

16:04.881 --> 16:06.716
What the hell is going on?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.176
Whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.803
Lieutenant Billets?

16:09.886 --> 16:11.763
Who are you?
And what the fuck are you doing?

16:11.846 --> 16:13.515
Lieutenant Klotz.
Investigating a complaint.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.392
- From whom?
- I cannot tell you that.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.435
Bullshit.
Where's your warrant?

16:17.519 --> 16:18.770
Don't need one. City property.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.021
This car belongs to LAPD.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.441
Now, step back
and let us do our job, hmm?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.237
That's not mine.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.784
I have never seen that before.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.371
Why don't we head inside,
Lieutenant?

16:36.454 --> 16:38.581
See if we can sort this out.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.676
Don't say anything
without a rep.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.850
What's eating you?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.518
Peña.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.894
What about him?

16:59.978 --> 17:03.481
He's gonna skate
without a fucking scratch.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.400
Thanks to the Feds.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.444
They don't give a shit
about our little arson fire.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.112
They do not.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.074
- Doesn't fucking sit right.
- No, it doesn't.

17:13.158 --> 17:14.451
There's gotta be a work-around.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.245
As a matter of fact, there is.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.997
You gonna tell me about it?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.665
If it pans out.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.292
Harry...

17:24.002 --> 17:26.254
Less you know, the better.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.757
I don't like the sound of that.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.551
Trust me.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.064
[Edgar] The memorial.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.858
It's gone.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.279
Bet the owners took it down.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.667
Lieutenant.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.878
Sir.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.546
You're entitled to
have a rep present.

18:08.630 --> 18:09.839
I don't need one.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.883
Very well.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.220
As you know,

18:15.303 --> 18:18.723
there's been an allegation
of corrupt conduct

18:18.807 --> 18:21.351
- lodged against you.
- Who is the complainant?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.186
Um...

18:23.269 --> 18:25.980
Andrew Patterson.
Gift of Gold jewelry.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.857
He was on your reach-out list.

18:27.941 --> 18:31.236
I met with him yesterday.
We discussed a security plan.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.403
He seemed satisfied.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.280
Claims you strong-armed him

18:34.364 --> 18:37.158
into giving you a pair
of expensive earrings.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.370
In exchange for "enhanced"
police services.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.746
That's ridiculous.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.541
I.A. found a pair
of gold earrings

18:44.624 --> 18:46.835
from his store in your car.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.670
They were planted.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.088
This is a setup.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.216
This has Leonard and Norris
written all over it.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.009
Again?

18:55.093 --> 18:56.886
You're obsessed with these guys.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.471
You really gonna go there?

18:58.555 --> 19:02.642
If by "go there" you mean
defend myself, absolutely.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.936
So be it.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.980
I have no choice
but to assign you home,

19:07.063 --> 19:08.690
pending the outcome
of this investigation.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.316
That's not necessary.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.318
I can continue to work
from here.

19:12.402 --> 19:16.656
Consider yourself lucky you're
not getting booked tonight.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.340
What's going on?

19:34.424 --> 19:37.218
The usual treason and fuckery.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.771
[exhales]

19:53.067 --> 19:54.110
Lieutenant?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.445
Not here.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.455
Let me give you a ride home.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.168
I'm gonna need a favor.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.673
[sniffs]
Look into this son of a bitch.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.729
[dispatcher] Charlie 2-3,
that register information

20:29.812 --> 20:34.233
on that blue SUV, Nevada plate
4-Delta-Alpha-9-0-2, stand by.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.946
[sputters, clicks tongue]

20:40.990 --> 20:42.408
[sighs]

20:46.454 --> 20:48.665
[deep sigh]

20:52.460 --> 20:53.920
What do we have here?

20:56.089 --> 20:59.092
Looks like Kipps
kept a scorecard.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.928
Insurance.
Case he had to deal someday.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.471
[Iverson] Only works
if you're not dead.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.974
He left it where
it could be found.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.810
Under a mattress instead of
a safe-deposit box.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.395
Revenge?
From beyond the grave?

21:10.478 --> 21:12.730
I would.
Take some motherfuckers with me.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.023
Does he name names?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.650
About a dozen victims.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.485
Maybe more.

21:17.568 --> 21:21.030
Franzen, Chandler...

21:21.114 --> 21:22.907
Maddie B.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.577
Who ordered those hits?
Can you tell?

21:26.661 --> 21:28.204
Those three?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.498
Carl Rogers.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.958
See?

21:32.041 --> 21:34.961
Exhibit A.
Rogers is toast.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.839
Looks like Rogers arranged it
through Fowkkes,

21:37.922 --> 21:39.215
gave him the targets.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.800
[Iverson] A full-service
law firm.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.719
Fowkkes call Kipps directly?

21:44.512 --> 21:45.513
[clicks tongue]

21:45.596 --> 21:46.723
Don't think so.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.765
[Bosch] Willy Datz.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.225
Right.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.644
Fowkkes called Datz
to set up the hits.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.814
Datz gave Kipps the who,
the when, the where.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.357
Datz figured Fowkkes had to go.

21:56.441 --> 21:57.608
Middleman knew too much.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.318
The last loophole.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.903
[door opens]

22:00.987 --> 22:04.407
Hey, listen. On our way
to LVPD to background Datz.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.659
Iverson's working the warrants.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.995
We'll hook Datz
at his place tomorrow.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.329
Have a better one.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.539
Later.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.166
Ready?

22:13.249 --> 22:15.001
Let's roll.

22:17.211 --> 22:21.632
I'm looking for Peña.
Have you seen him?

22:21.716 --> 22:25.261
I haven't seen him.
He hasn't been around.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.433
[engine turns off]

22:31.434 --> 22:32.351
Ten cuidado, eh.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.318
Hey, hey. Hey, tranquilo.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.572
Tranquilo. Tranquilo.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.414
[grunts, groans]

22:59.670 --> 23:00.671
[grunts]

23:01.756 --> 23:03.007
[groans]

23:08.262 --> 23:09.472
[cork pops]

23:14.769 --> 23:16.104
He asleep?

23:16.187 --> 23:17.814
Yes.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.736
To our son James.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.613
Our precious son.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.031
Home at last.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.282
[glasses clink]

23:28.366 --> 23:30.952
We, um, we have something else
to celebrate.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.537
Oh?

23:32.620 --> 23:33.871
My second term.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.206
I met with the mayor today.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.209
Oh, Irv. That is so wonderful.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.128
What changed her mind?

23:41.629 --> 23:44.173
My unparalleled
powers of persuasion.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.550
Oh, yeah.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.301
I can attest to those.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.178
Cheers, Chief.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.016
[Antonio] Hey, buddy.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.852
Make yourself at home.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.438
So what's the custody
arrangement?

23:59.522 --> 24:02.024
Dad gets him every other
weekend, Christmas Eve,

24:02.108 --> 24:04.944
Fourth of July
and six weeks in the summer.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.821
You're kidding. Seriously?

24:06.904 --> 24:09.157
I'm kidding.
We're playing it by ear.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.325
He'll take him whenever
he's not working.

24:11.409 --> 24:14.036
I guess we'll be
seeing a lot of you.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.414
Do you mind?

24:16.497 --> 24:18.291
Mi casa es tu casa.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.878
Yeah, I don't think
he speaks Spanish.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.171
[Antonio] High time he learned.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.926
I guess we should
make it official.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.638
Do you keep a key
underneath your mat?

24:32.722 --> 24:34.765
You might as well
leave the front door open.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.350
I keep an extra key
under the mat.

24:36.434 --> 24:38.144
[laughs]

24:38.227 --> 24:39.854
You are a mess.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.732
Do you also hide your money
under your mattress?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.317
Please.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.361
Everyone knows the freezer's
a much better place.

24:47.445 --> 24:48.696
[laughs]

24:51.282 --> 24:52.617
[Coltrane whines softly]

24:53.743 --> 24:56.037
[phone ringing]

24:56.120 --> 24:57.496
Vega?

24:57.580 --> 24:59.498
[Vega] Patterson likes
to beat on his wife.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.083
She had to get
a restraining order.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.085
One of the conditions
of that order is

25:03.169 --> 25:05.671
he turn in his firearms,
which he has not done.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.506
Gives you a reason to go
and talk to him.
