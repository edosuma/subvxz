00:01.030 --> 00:02.464
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:02.465 --> 00:03.508
Turn it off.

00:03.509 --> 00:05.764
She's ruthless
without her humanity.

00:05.765 --> 00:08.166
I'm done playing nice.

00:08.167 --> 00:10.509
Guess it wasn't a good idea
that he was wearing this.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.887
That's emotion, Elena.

00:11.888 --> 00:14.073
Silas is psychic.
He can get into people's heads,

00:14.074 --> 00:15.285
read their minds,
make them see things

00:15.286 --> 00:16.441
that aren't really there.

00:16.442 --> 00:17.809
Silas wants me to drop the veil

00:17.810 --> 00:19.828
between our side
and the other side.

00:19.829 --> 00:22.347
He wants to take the cure
and then he wants to die.

00:22.348 --> 00:25.117
I said I'd help him and I've been
hiding from him ever since.

00:25.118 --> 00:27.285
What did I do?
I almost killed him.

00:27.286 --> 00:29.487
Matt. I almost...
No! No!

00:30.322 --> 00:31.957
Emotions are overwhelming you.

00:31.958 --> 00:33.908
You just have to
focus on one thing, ok?

00:33.910 --> 00:36.895
- I did. I focused on hate.
- Katherine.

00:36.896 --> 00:40.182
Even if you spend 10 minutes of
your life hating her, she wins.

00:40.183 --> 00:42.033
Not if I kill her.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.391
- And?
- That did nothing for me.

00:49.392 --> 00:50.558
How was it for you?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.211
Again.

00:58.585 --> 01:00.619
Good. Now.

01:00.621 --> 01:01.787
Focus on letting it go.

01:01.788 --> 01:03.389
Or we could skip
the sublimating part

01:03.390 --> 01:05.925
and you can tell me where she is
so that I can rip her head off.

01:05.926 --> 01:07.393
I don't know where Katherine is

01:07.394 --> 01:09.345
and even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

01:09.346 --> 01:12.265
Stefan, you're the one who told me
to channel all of my emotions

01:12.266 --> 01:13.433
into one single feeling.

01:13.434 --> 01:14.734
I realize that.
I just figured

01:14.735 --> 01:17.854
it would be love,
or hope, or compassion.

01:17.855 --> 01:20.406
Not unwavering hatred
for a ruthless vampire

01:20.407 --> 01:23.827
- that's 500 years older than you.
- One?

01:23.828 --> 01:26.278
Give me 50 pull-ups.

01:29.782 --> 01:32.952
You wanted to kill Klaus
when you got your emotions back.

01:32.953 --> 01:36.122
I know, and I couldn't.

01:36.123 --> 01:37.956
You don't think
I can kill Katherine?

01:37.958 --> 01:39.876
I don't think you really want to.

01:39.877 --> 01:42.712
Maybe you're right.
Maybe

01:42.713 --> 01:45.548
I just want to feel
the warmth of her chest cavity

01:45.549 --> 01:47.333
as I rip out her heart

01:47.334 --> 01:50.469
and watch her face as she realizes
I took it from her.

01:52.672 --> 01:57.175
Nah, I just want to kill her.
It's that simple.

01:57.926 --> 01:59.611
I'm gonna go shower.

02:10.073 --> 02:12.208
So, let me get this straight.
You send out a notice

02:12.209 --> 02:14.577
of your impending graduation,
and people feel

02:14.578 --> 02:17.380
- obliged to give you money?
- Pretty much.

02:17.381 --> 02:19.999
Sounds brilliant.
Why aren't you participating?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.001
- I don't have a whole lot of family.
- Well, that makes two of us.

02:23.003 --> 02:24.837
Besides, I don't think
it was my mother's dream

02:24.838 --> 02:28.091
to see me in a cap and gown.
How about your mom?

02:28.092 --> 02:30.526
Let's just say I'm not holding
my breath for a graduation check.

02:35.181 --> 02:36.465
Stamp, please.

02:38.101 --> 02:39.686
Thank you.

02:39.687 --> 02:41.905
You don't have to pretend
to be nice to me, Caroline.

02:41.906 --> 02:44.575
I know this is just a ploy
to keep me distracted.

02:45.993 --> 02:48.911
You're done?
I'm only on my second batch.

02:48.913 --> 02:51.163
We have family friends in Denver.

02:51.999 --> 02:55.952
Other than that,
no one cares that I'm graduating.

02:55.953 --> 02:57.921
And to be honest, neither do I.

02:57.922 --> 02:59.539
You know, that's how you feel now,

02:59.540 --> 03:01.958
but once you get through this
hating Katherine phase...

03:01.959 --> 03:04.294
Wait. Do you know
where Katherine is?

03:04.295 --> 03:05.495
No. Why would I know where she is?

03:05.496 --> 03:07.664
Yeah, but Caroline, if you did,
you would tell me, right?

03:07.665 --> 03:10.100
Elena, you're obsessing.

03:10.101 --> 03:11.635
Caroline, listen to me.

03:11.636 --> 03:14.003
If you know where Katherine is,
you have to tell me.

03:14.004 --> 03:19.033
I don't.
Elena... Chill.

03:28.368 --> 03:30.454
Hello!

03:37.077 --> 03:38.828
Could you be any creepier?

03:40.363 --> 03:41.630
Why are we here?

03:42.632 --> 03:44.134
You want me to make you
truly immortal

03:44.135 --> 03:45.368
so that nothing can kill you.

03:45.369 --> 03:47.170
To do that, I need to
talk to Qetsiyah,

03:47.171 --> 03:49.539
which means I need to lower
the veil to the other side.

03:49.540 --> 03:50.807
That still doesn't explain why you

03:50.808 --> 03:54.042
made me trudge through
mud in $500 boots.

03:55.395 --> 03:57.097
A few miles that way,

03:57.098 --> 03:59.349
12 hybrids were killed
at the Lockwood cellar.

03:59.350 --> 04:00.717
And a few Miles that
way, 12 humans died

04:00.718 --> 04:02.152
at the Young farm.

04:02.153 --> 04:04.321
And this is the site where
12 witches were killed.

04:04.322 --> 04:06.156
13 if you don't get to the point.

04:06.157 --> 04:07.724
It's the expression triangle.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.327
I need to charge all 3 points
and channel the mystical energy

04:10.328 --> 04:11.561
from Silas's tombstone.

04:11.562 --> 04:13.229
Once that happens,
I can drop the veil

04:13.230 --> 04:14.614
inside the 3 points

04:14.615 --> 04:16.449
and just long enough
to get what I need.

04:16.451 --> 04:18.785
And what exactly do you need?

04:18.786 --> 04:22.238
Silas has done nothing
but torment my friends.

04:22.239 --> 04:24.374
Now he wants to unleash
hell on earth.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.375
He's evil.
In 2,000 years,

04:26.377 --> 04:29.379
only one person has been
able to put him down.

04:29.380 --> 04:31.414
Let me guess.
Qetsiyah.

04:31.415 --> 04:35.051
If I can contact her,
I can ask her how to do it.

04:35.052 --> 04:36.136
Now hand me the rock.

04:36.137 --> 04:39.389
You're gonna flood Mystic Falls
with dead, supernatural creatures

04:39.390 --> 04:42.258
so that you can ask
a 2,000-year-old witch

04:42.259 --> 04:45.529
not one but two favors? Ha!

04:45.530 --> 04:47.788
I think I'll take
my business elsewhere.

04:54.437 --> 04:57.072
- What the hell?
- I linked us.

04:58.358 --> 05:00.360
Which means you're stuck
with me for the day.

05:00.361 --> 05:01.545
Silas can be anyone.

05:01.546 --> 05:02.913
If he gets in your
head and figures out

05:02.914 --> 05:06.282
I don't need a full
moon to do the spell,

05:06.283 --> 05:07.466
it's over.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.253
Now, about that tombstone.

05:17.227 --> 05:18.978
You just missed the donuts.

05:20.397 --> 05:21.848
Yeah, I was with Elena

05:21.849 --> 05:24.267
burning off a few thousand
hate-filled calories.

05:24.268 --> 05:25.652
What happened to you helping me?

05:25.653 --> 05:28.271
Help? Yes.
Prolonging the inevitable,

05:28.272 --> 05:29.356
waste of my time.

05:29.357 --> 05:31.140
Hmm.
You're avoiding.

05:31.141 --> 05:32.475
How unexpected.

05:32.476 --> 05:35.311
I'm not avoiding. Elena's only goal
is to end Katherine's life,

05:35.312 --> 05:36.780
and that's not gonna just magically

05:36.781 --> 05:39.082
disappear with pilates
and a juice cleanse.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.200
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

05:41.202 --> 05:43.003
Hey.
Why were we invited?

05:43.004 --> 05:44.871
Well, the hospital has
kept the blood banks empty

05:44.872 --> 05:46.288
ever since they were
raided last month.

05:46.290 --> 05:47.657
We thought at the very least,

05:47.658 --> 05:49.793
it would help keep
the vampire population away.

05:49.794 --> 05:52.661
- And it didn't?
- See for yourself.

06:01.271 --> 06:02.438
Whoa.

06:07.777 --> 06:09.696
There were 4 other
victims in this wing.

06:09.697 --> 06:11.947
Each one almost completely
drained of blood.

06:12.782 --> 06:14.317
You think it's Silas?

06:14.318 --> 06:17.070
Or a doctor with some
very questionable bedside manner.

06:17.071 --> 06:19.489
But 5 victims?
It's a lot of blood

06:19.490 --> 06:20.974
and it's not like he
can take it with him.

06:20.975 --> 06:24.027
Unless he's fueling up
for something big.

06:24.028 --> 06:26.528
Big? Any details would be helpful,

06:26.530 --> 06:28.163
considering I'm
dealing with 5 grieving

06:28.165 --> 06:30.700
families out there
and a psychic killer on the loose.

06:30.701 --> 06:32.302
Silas wants Bonnie to do a spell

06:32.303 --> 06:34.421
to drop the veil
from the other side.

06:34.422 --> 06:36.172
I have no idea what that means.

06:36.173 --> 06:38.508
It's an invisible wall
that separates our plane

06:38.509 --> 06:41.144
from the plane of all
dead supernatural creatures.

06:41.145 --> 06:45.181
Now, Silas wants that to go away
so he can take the cure, die,

06:45.182 --> 06:49.569
and not have to spend an eternity
in a supernatural purgatory.

06:49.570 --> 06:52.489
And when do you suppose
Silas plans on doing this?

06:52.490 --> 06:56.242
Next full moon.
Tomorrow night.

06:58.227 --> 07:02.064
Ugh. That old Lockwood cellar
reeks of wet dog.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.901
I'll be staying up here.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.569
You obviously don't know
how this works.

07:18.965 --> 07:20.467
You realize I'm not just some

07:20.468 --> 07:22.886
wandering child in
a supermarket, right?

07:22.887 --> 07:24.888
I'm a vampire that can kill you.

07:24.889 --> 07:28.058
Whatever happens to me
happens to you.

07:28.059 --> 07:29.976
Do you really think
I want you here?

07:29.977 --> 07:33.980
And what is here?
Oh. Right.

07:33.981 --> 07:36.598
12 dead hybrids.
This should be good.

08:02.542 --> 08:04.427
Is it supposed to rain tonight?

08:04.428 --> 08:06.729
Do I look like a meteorologist?

08:10.884 --> 08:14.054
Someone needs to do something,
before she explodes.

08:14.055 --> 08:15.437
I got this.

08:20.944 --> 08:22.111
Drink.

08:23.063 --> 08:24.613
You're putting everyone on edge.

08:28.118 --> 08:29.868
So. What's the deal?

08:29.870 --> 08:32.739
I'm new to this whole
emotional switch situation.

08:32.740 --> 08:35.659
It's not complicated.
See that dart board?

08:35.659 --> 08:38.611
All I can picture
is Katherine's face.

08:38.611 --> 08:41.280
So, your emotions are on,
they're just dialed to rage.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.751
Look, Rebekah, I get that
we had our Thelma and Louise thing

08:44.752 --> 08:49.222
back when I had my humanity off,
but let me make one thing clear...

08:49.223 --> 08:50.697
We're not friends.

08:53.024 --> 08:56.994
What about us?
Are we still friends?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.363
All those things you said
when your humanity was off,

08:59.364 --> 09:02.083
is that how you really feel?

09:02.084 --> 09:04.668
Caroline, I really don't feel
like going down memory lane.

09:06.871 --> 09:09.290
Well, what about when you said,

09:09.291 --> 09:12.460
and I quote, "you're a repulsive,

09:12.461 --> 09:14.878
blood-sucking,
control freak monster"?

09:16.330 --> 09:18.098
Did you really mean those things?

09:21.218 --> 09:23.588
If you're waiting for an apology,
you're not gonna get one.

09:23.589 --> 09:25.356
I can't let myself feel bad,

09:25.357 --> 09:29.810
because if I feel bad, then
I feel everything, and...

09:29.811 --> 09:32.062
We've all seen
how well I handle that.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.913
The power's
completely out.

09:48.914 --> 09:50.447
I'll call my mom!

09:50.448 --> 09:52.282
Maybe she knows what's going on.

09:59.623 --> 10:02.059
12 humans
burned to death here.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.793
They died in vain for Silas.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.599
What did you do?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.433
I linked the final hot spot.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.655
It's time to drop the veil.

10:19.402 --> 10:22.383
The power outages originated
at 3 different places in town...

10:22.385 --> 10:24.637
the Young farm,
the Lockwood estate,

10:24.638 --> 10:27.105
and a blown transformer
off old Miller Road.

10:28.808 --> 10:31.443
These are the locations
of the Silas massacres.

10:34.647 --> 10:36.682
It's the expression triangle.

10:36.683 --> 10:40.283
- Bonnie must be doing the spell.
- So much for needing a full moon.

10:40.284 --> 10:42.309
I know something else.
One of the power company guys

10:42.310 --> 10:44.497
has a daughter who goes
to school with Bonnie.

10:44.499 --> 10:47.735
He saw her leaving
the Young farm an hour ago.

10:47.736 --> 10:48.902
With Elena.

10:49.787 --> 10:51.621
But Caroline's with Elena.

10:51.622 --> 10:53.925
Looks like Bonnie Bennett has a new
doppelganger friend.

10:53.926 --> 10:55.276
So, how do we find them?

10:55.277 --> 10:57.494
Well, they must be
somewhere in the triangle.

10:57.495 --> 10:59.747
My guess is right in the middle.

10:59.748 --> 11:01.514
And where exactly might that be?

11:10.141 --> 11:13.394
- Where's Caroline?
- Inside looking for Bonnie.

11:13.395 --> 11:14.812
I think we should split up.

11:14.813 --> 11:17.680
Damon and I can look outside
while you and Caroline look inside.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.484
All right.
Let me know if you find anything.

11:24.121 --> 11:25.789
Someone's an eager beaver.

11:27.124 --> 11:28.458
Where's Katherine?

11:30.161 --> 11:31.662
Now I get it.

11:31.663 --> 11:33.197
One brother shoots you down,

11:33.198 --> 11:35.216
you ask the other one.
Great.

11:35.217 --> 11:36.500
You know, don't you?

11:36.501 --> 11:38.668
Do you not notice
all the end of the world

11:38.670 --> 11:40.471
crap going on right now?

11:40.472 --> 11:42.256
Tell me that you
don't want her dead.

11:42.257 --> 11:44.008
After everything
that she did to you.

11:44.009 --> 11:46.177
Stringing you along
for hundreds of years.

11:46.178 --> 11:47.345
Elena, we don't need
to list all the reasons

11:47.346 --> 11:48.646
that I hate Katherine.

11:48.647 --> 11:50.314
What we need to do is find Bonnie.
Come on.

11:50.315 --> 11:51.932
I don't care about Bonnie.

11:51.933 --> 11:55.568
- I care about killing Katherine.
- They're together.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.573
Ok? So maybe you should
do a little less threatening

11:59.574 --> 12:01.741
and a little more looking.
Come on.

12:06.730 --> 12:10.618
Hey. There you are.
Any luck?

12:10.619 --> 12:12.570
I searched the whole school.

12:12.571 --> 12:13.921
She should be here.

12:16.707 --> 12:17.874
What was that?

12:45.769 --> 12:48.288
Hmm. Ice is melting.

12:50.708 --> 12:54.045
It just doesn't make any sense.
This is the center of the triangle.

12:54.046 --> 12:56.330
If she's gonna do the spell,
she has to do it here.

12:56.331 --> 12:58.716
This is where they should be.

12:58.717 --> 13:01.468
Actually, I think we're
in the right place.

13:02.286 --> 13:03.953
Just the wrong elevation.

13:12.229 --> 13:15.566
Ok. This is the center
of the triangle.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.401
I'm ready.

13:17.402 --> 13:19.937
Now give me the tombstone.

13:19.938 --> 13:23.357
The fact that this spell hinges
on some crappy hunk of blood-rock

13:23.358 --> 13:25.659
does little to inspire
my confidence.

13:25.660 --> 13:27.862
It's filled with
the calcified blood of Qetsiyah,

13:27.863 --> 13:30.147
one of the strongest
witches in the world.

13:30.148 --> 13:31.949
It'll work.

13:31.950 --> 13:33.417
If I remember correctly,

13:33.418 --> 13:35.786
I think there's
an entrance in the basement.

13:35.787 --> 13:38.589
- Where's the basement?
- Off the boiler room.

13:38.590 --> 13:40.673
You hear that? I'll meet you there.

13:45.429 --> 13:47.598
What? You're gonna
have to stay here.

13:47.599 --> 13:49.100
Are you kidding me?

13:49.101 --> 13:51.135
We really need to stop
Bonnie from doing this spell,

13:51.136 --> 13:53.053
and if you get all
murderous and screw it up...

13:53.054 --> 13:54.171
is that really the reason?

13:54.172 --> 13:56.974
As self-righteous as Stefan is,
he has a point.

13:56.975 --> 13:59.977
Behind your rage,
there is a tidal wave of feelings.

13:59.978 --> 14:02.346
All of your guilt,
all your grief.

14:02.347 --> 14:04.348
Every emotion you've ever put off.

14:04.349 --> 14:06.100
And killing Katherine's
gonna let it all in,

14:06.101 --> 14:08.185
and if you can't handle it,

14:08.186 --> 14:09.537
then we're back to square one.

14:09.538 --> 14:11.355
And if I can?

14:11.356 --> 14:12.856
What if killing Katherine

14:12.857 --> 14:15.359
takes away all that
grief and guilt?

14:15.360 --> 14:18.846
What if killing Katherine finally
lets me feel all the good things

14:18.847 --> 14:20.193
that I've lost?

14:21.999 --> 14:24.661
Damon, help me.

14:24.986 --> 14:27.704
As soon as I get over this hurdle,
I'll be me.

14:27.705 --> 14:28.973
I'll be able to think clearly.

14:28.974 --> 14:31.658
I'll be myself and everything will
go back to normal.

14:35.479 --> 14:38.848
She's strong. And crafty.
And you'll die.

14:44.022 --> 14:45.593
Then at least I'll die trying.

15:11.748 --> 15:13.467
What is happening?

15:13.468 --> 15:15.852
I'm channeling
the expression triangle.

15:25.396 --> 15:26.563
It's done.

15:28.199 --> 15:29.465
The veil is down.

15:43.581 --> 15:44.747
Need a hand?

15:52.410 --> 15:57.465
Uhh!

15:57.466 --> 16:00.685
So, this is either really
good or really bad.

16:00.686 --> 16:04.522
- It's good to see you, too, Damon.
- I'd say the feeling was mutual,

16:04.523 --> 16:06.406
except a lot of people
aren't exactly

16:06.408 --> 16:08.259
who they say they are around here.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.028
You think I'm Silas?
Are you kidding me?

16:12.147 --> 16:15.933
Uhh. See, this puts us
in a bit of a pickle,

16:15.934 --> 16:18.785
cause that is exactly
what Silas would say.

16:23.909 --> 16:27.278
Now, would Silas know
about locker 42?

16:32.951 --> 16:36.171
Ahh. Hang on.

16:36.172 --> 16:39.723
If I can see you,
and I can touch you,

16:39.725 --> 16:42.677
that means the little witch did it.
She dropped the veil.

16:42.678 --> 16:45.597
Well, not completely.
It's only down

16:45.598 --> 16:47.515
inside the expression triangle.

16:47.516 --> 16:50.635
If I step outside of it,
it's back to ghost world.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.353
Where's everybody?
I figure with the veil down,

16:52.354 --> 16:54.105
it'd be like ghost-a-palooza.

16:54.106 --> 16:56.991
Not every ghost has a reason
to come back to Mystic Falls.

16:56.992 --> 16:58.776
Just the ones like me,

16:58.777 --> 17:01.662
looking out for their
idiot best friends.

17:02.947 --> 17:04.482
I'm more worried about
the ones looking out

17:04.483 --> 17:05.648
for their enemies.

17:11.422 --> 17:13.073
This wind is weird.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.310
One minute it was
blowing like a hurricane.

17:15.310 --> 17:17.962
Now nothing, not even a breeze.

17:17.963 --> 17:20.830
Looks like something
wicked finally came.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.934
You know, you don't
have to be here.

17:22.935 --> 17:25.819
I mean, technically,
only one of us is getting paid.

17:25.820 --> 17:29.474
But it's fun.
And kind of cozy.

17:29.475 --> 17:35.146
With the storm outside
and the candlelight. And us.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.324
Oh, my God. Kol.

17:46.325 --> 17:50.494
Greetings from the dead.
So, who fancies a drink?

17:58.753 --> 18:00.972
I thought I'd never see you again.

18:00.973 --> 18:05.260
Spare me the waterworks, sister.
I've already watched you grieve.

18:05.261 --> 18:07.462
Lasted a full 24 hours, remember?

18:07.463 --> 18:09.681
I'm assuming this means
Bonnie dropped the veil.

18:09.682 --> 18:11.765
Not completely, and not for long.

18:11.767 --> 18:14.836
But who am I to give up
an opportunity for revenge?

18:14.837 --> 18:19.056
My killer's already dead,
but his sister's just as culpable.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.858
So maybe you could
help me find her.

18:20.859 --> 18:21.993
If you hurt Elena...

18:21.994 --> 18:23.811
Oh...

18:23.812 --> 18:24.996
I'm going to.

18:24.997 --> 18:26.397
But please, continue.
I'm curious

18:26.398 --> 18:27.615
as to where you're going with this.

18:27.616 --> 18:29.667
You've made your point, Kol. Leave.

18:29.668 --> 18:31.235
First tell me where
I can find Elena.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.670
She left here hours ago.

18:32.671 --> 18:35.255
We don't know where she is.
Now get out.

18:40.295 --> 18:41.763
I see you finally
got the quarterback

18:41.764 --> 18:43.180
to pay attention to you.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.916
How's the throwing arm, champ?

18:48.603 --> 18:50.721
Uhh!

18:53.024 --> 18:54.025
Tick tock, Bonnie.

18:54.026 --> 18:55.259
Stop talking.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.644
I can't reach out to Qetsiyah

18:56.645 --> 18:59.262
with you breaking my concentration
every 5 seconds.

19:10.591 --> 19:14.111
Bonnie. Did you hear that?
Someone's coming.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.545
Will you be quiet?

19:17.715 --> 19:21.085
I have vampire hearing, Bonnie,
and there's someone here.

19:21.086 --> 19:22.620
Unlink me so that
I can go stall them

19:22.621 --> 19:23.971
while we wait for
Qetsiyah to show up.

19:23.972 --> 19:25.423
I'm not letting you go.

19:25.424 --> 19:27.892
Then at least give me some slack.

19:27.893 --> 19:30.811
Fine. Go.
Stop them.

19:42.273 --> 19:43.940
Silas?

19:45.326 --> 19:46.993
Come and get me.

19:55.653 --> 19:56.954
Uhh!

19:56.955 --> 19:58.321
Hello, Katherine.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.325
Oh! Ohhh!

20:09.500 --> 20:12.470
I let you out of your cage
and this is how you thank me?

20:12.471 --> 20:15.188
No. This is how I thank you.

20:16.023 --> 20:17.692
Aah! Ow!

20:17.693 --> 20:21.361
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

20:26.517 --> 20:28.703
Bonnie. Bonnie, what happened?

20:28.704 --> 20:31.038
Katherine. Find Katherine.
We're linked.

20:31.039 --> 20:32.690
Then unlink her.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.125
You go.
I'll stay with Bonnie.

20:36.412 --> 20:38.529
You have done nothing but suck
the happiness

20:38.530 --> 20:39.630
out of my life.

20:39.631 --> 20:42.867
Uhh. Well, now I get to kill you.

20:42.868 --> 20:45.869
- No, wait, please.
- Good-bye, Katherine.

20:47.555 --> 20:48.889
Stefan!

20:50.207 --> 20:51.809
Thanks for the save, handsome.

20:51.810 --> 20:53.895
Get the hell out of here
before I kill you myself.

20:53.896 --> 20:57.514
Really?
I'm your biggest problem right now?

21:03.154 --> 21:06.224
You know, I could just cure this
for you easily, right?

21:06.225 --> 21:11.612
I'll be fine.

21:11.613 --> 21:13.497
Why won't you ever let me help you?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.717
It's not you, it's...

21:16.718 --> 21:18.002
Look, people in this town

21:18.003 --> 21:19.871
have a bad habit of
turning into vampires

21:19.872 --> 21:23.673
and I'd like to graduate
High School as a human.

21:27.678 --> 21:29.771
I think there's a first
aid kit in the back.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.416
Ok.

21:51.319 --> 21:53.102
Caroline, how are you still here...

21:56.273 --> 21:58.042
Oh, my God.

21:58.043 --> 21:59.609
I have to keep cutting.

22:02.914 --> 22:06.466
- Bonnie, are you ok?
- Yeah, now that I unlinked her.

22:08.219 --> 22:11.388
- What are you doing down here?
- Waiting for Qetsiyah.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.140
You might be waiting a while.

22:15.259 --> 22:17.293
Qetsiyah's not coming, Bonnie.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.646
Silas.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.602
But... I saw Caroline.
How?

22:24.603 --> 22:26.737
I thought you couldn't
get inside my head.

22:26.738 --> 22:29.023
That's what I wanted you to think.

22:29.024 --> 22:33.911
I can make you see
whatever I want you to see.

22:33.912 --> 22:36.280
Am I a disfigured monster?

22:36.281 --> 22:39.083
Of course not.
A monster

22:39.084 --> 22:40.917
is what I wanted you to see.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.488
That's the beauty of all this.

22:44.489 --> 22:50.213
- You have no idea who I am.
- Or what I look like.

22:51.096 --> 22:54.265
Or how deep I am
inside of your head.

22:54.266 --> 22:58.335
You thought that you were
more powerful than me?

22:58.336 --> 23:03.007
I'm stronger than you can imagine.
I defeated the hunter's curse

23:03.008 --> 23:04.392
in minutes.

23:04.393 --> 23:06.811
You thought that
you could betray me.

23:06.812 --> 23:12.683
You can't.
I will always be one step ahead.

23:21.638 --> 23:24.257
How could you save her?
She was as good as dead.

23:24.258 --> 23:25.758
Yeah, and so was Bonnie.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.594
Bonnie used a spell to
link herself to Katherine,

23:27.595 --> 23:29.979
so if you killed her,
Bonnie would be dead, too,

23:29.980 --> 23:33.817
- How do you know that?
- Because I saw her, Elena.

23:33.818 --> 23:36.686
You almost killed your best friend.

23:36.687 --> 23:38.070
I don't believe you.

23:38.072 --> 23:40.490
Really? You never wanted
me to kill Katherine.

23:40.491 --> 23:41.991
Why are you protecting her, Stefan?

23:41.992 --> 23:44.444
Listen to yourself.
Your rage is making you crazy.

23:44.445 --> 23:47.247
- Do you still have feelings for her?
- This isn't even about Katherine.

23:47.248 --> 23:48.498
This is about Jeremy.

23:48.499 --> 23:50.583
What, you think that killing her
will take all that pain away?

23:50.584 --> 23:51.785
It won't.

23:51.786 --> 23:53.586
Oh, but beating up
cinder blocks will?

23:53.587 --> 23:56.706
No. It's a distraction.
Just like killing Katherine,

23:56.707 --> 23:58.407
just like turning
your emotions off.

23:58.408 --> 24:00.627
The truth is,
there are no shortcuts.

24:00.628 --> 24:04.213
You are a vampire, Elena.
Loss is part of the deal.

24:05.248 --> 24:08.017
Look, I've been alive
for 163 years.

24:08.018 --> 24:09.986
I have lost more loved
ones than I can count

24:09.987 --> 24:12.317
and it hurts me every single time.

24:12.318 --> 24:15.925
So, there's no hope.
You're saying I'm hopeless.

24:15.926 --> 24:19.529
No. I'm saying you have
to face your grief.

24:19.530 --> 24:21.564
But you don't have to do it alone.
I can help you.

24:21.565 --> 24:23.700
Oh, of course you can.
God, Stefan,

24:23.701 --> 24:26.803
always trying to help and your
concern for me is just like...

24:26.804 --> 24:29.072
You're transferring some rage on me.
That's good.

24:29.073 --> 24:32.942
I don't need to transfer anything.
I can hate two people just fine.

24:32.943 --> 24:34.109
Elena.

24:37.747 --> 24:40.966
Just like the cinder block.
Nothing.

24:46.556 --> 24:48.291
Caroline, hey, snap out of it.,

24:48.292 --> 24:49.759
I need to bleed.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.427
Silas wants me to bleed.

24:51.428 --> 24:53.679
Stop it.
You're hallucinating.

24:54.289 --> 24:56.920
Just let me do this.
I need to do this.

24:56.921 --> 24:59.068
♪ hands off.

24:59.069 --> 25:02.605
She's been here the whole time.
That means Silas is with you.

25:02.606 --> 25:04.574
- Perfect.
- Yeah, it gets worse.

25:04.575 --> 25:07.310
The veil's down.
Kol came by looking for Elena.

25:07.311 --> 25:08.945
Seemed a little pissed.

25:08.946 --> 25:11.029
Do you have any good news
for me, Donovan?

25:11.030 --> 25:14.378
♪
Just watch your back.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.754
Call Stefan.
Tell him about Caroline.

25:17.755 --> 25:19.122
Tell him to keep an eye on Elena.

25:19.123 --> 25:20.707
God knows he'll do a
better job than me.

25:20.708 --> 25:23.325
Stefan?
Isn't she your girlfriend?

25:25.094 --> 25:27.997
Who knows?
I know she was sired to me.

25:27.998 --> 25:30.466
I know her emotions were off.
I know she's so full of rage

25:30.467 --> 25:31.935
she wants to rip
Katherine's head off...

25:31.936 --> 25:34.270
But you have no idea
how she feels about you

25:34.271 --> 25:36.438
and now you're freaking out.

25:39.142 --> 25:40.359
Call Stefan.

25:42.345 --> 25:43.346
Let go of me!

25:43.347 --> 25:44.480
Have you tried compelling her?

25:44.481 --> 25:45.514
I can't.
She's on vervain.

25:45.515 --> 25:46.682
Let me go!

25:46.683 --> 25:50.069
Look, Caroline, you're graduating
and Uncle Bob and Aunt Mary

25:50.070 --> 25:52.155
really want you to graduate
with both your hands.

25:52.156 --> 25:54.574
I need to keep cutting.
I need to keep cutting.

25:54.575 --> 25:56.376
- I need to keep cutting.
- Stop!

25:56.377 --> 25:57.542
Oh!

26:03.967 --> 26:06.085
Bitch!

26:06.086 --> 26:08.470
That is the Caroline
I know and loathe.

26:10.723 --> 26:12.874
Stay away from me.

26:14.060 --> 26:15.477
Gladly.

26:18.481 --> 26:20.349
Once you finish the spell.

26:21.517 --> 26:23.820
Then when the veil is
dropped completely,

26:23.821 --> 26:25.320
I can take the cure.

26:28.942 --> 26:32.895
I just want to pass on, Bonnie.
I'll even let you kill me.

26:32.896 --> 26:34.514
I'll be out of your life for good.

26:34.515 --> 26:36.399
But every dead
supernatural creature

26:36.400 --> 26:38.034
will be roaming the earth.

26:38.035 --> 26:42.372
Well, if you don't help me,
I'll be roaming the earth.

26:42.373 --> 26:44.407
I was never gonna drop the veil.

26:44.408 --> 26:46.960
I'm curious.
What was your plan?

26:46.961 --> 26:48.995
Pow-wow with Qetsiyah?

26:48.996 --> 26:51.681
Brainstorm ways to put me down?

26:51.682 --> 26:53.683
Qetsiyah's not coming.

26:53.684 --> 26:55.885
She wants me on the
other side with her.

26:55.886 --> 26:57.353
For eternity.

26:57.354 --> 27:00.222
Bonnie? Bonnie?

27:01.357 --> 27:03.191
That sounds familiar.

27:05.545 --> 27:07.529
Maybe Damon will convince you.

27:07.531 --> 27:10.232
- I won't let you...
- You won't let me what?

27:12.652 --> 27:14.537
You feel that, Bonnie?

27:18.441 --> 27:21.911
The air. Thinning.

27:21.912 --> 27:24.714
Barely enough to breathe.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.862
'"Brother and friend"?

27:45.863 --> 27:48.125
What genius came up with that one?

28:00.416 --> 28:02.182
I give up, Jer.

28:05.204 --> 28:08.156
I really wanted to kill her
for you, but...

28:09.926 --> 28:11.761
There's no point.
Stefan's right.

28:11.762 --> 28:15.297
It's just a distraction.
And...

28:29.612 --> 28:31.898
I can't.
I can't do this.

28:31.899 --> 28:34.421
I can't...

28:37.019 --> 28:41.523
I can't move on,
and I don't want to.

28:44.077 --> 28:46.629
If that makes me weak,
then fine, I'm weak.

28:46.630 --> 28:51.890
But I can't handle you...

28:53.812 --> 28:56.832
I can't handle you being gone...

28:57.673 --> 29:00.875
And I can't handle
feeling like this anymore.

29:12.721 --> 29:14.222
Hello, old friend.

29:16.692 --> 29:18.026
Pity about your brother.

29:19.695 --> 29:21.530
Guess it's just me against you now.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.930
Bonnie.

29:45.168 --> 29:46.720
This isn't real, Bonnie.

29:46.721 --> 29:49.273
Feel the air in your lungs.

29:49.274 --> 29:52.109
- Break through.
- Silas?

29:52.110 --> 29:54.310
Would Silas try and save your life?

29:55.345 --> 29:57.146
Now, breathe, child.

29:57.965 --> 30:00.975
There.

30:10.694 --> 30:15.047
- I was so worried about you.
- I know.

30:16.466 --> 30:17.667
But I'm ok.

30:21.672 --> 30:23.339
I've been watching over you.

30:24.458 --> 30:25.841
I messed up.

30:27.043 --> 30:28.495
I'm sorry.

30:28.496 --> 30:32.115
- You can still stop Silas.
- No, I can't.

30:32.116 --> 30:33.750
Qetsiyah was able to immobilize him

30:33.751 --> 30:35.285
so he couldn't feed
and get into people's heads.

30:35.286 --> 30:36.486
I don't know how to do that.

30:36.487 --> 30:40.406
- I don't know how to put him down.
- You can do that.

30:41.325 --> 30:44.895
Expression is the manifestation
of your will.

30:44.896 --> 30:46.295
You can do anything.

30:48.015 --> 30:50.516
I don't like it, but sometimes,
there are no choices.

30:51.818 --> 30:53.836
But you are strong enough.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.782
You can do this.

31:02.579 --> 31:04.914
Whoa. It's just me.

31:04.915 --> 31:07.082
I called Stefan.
He's heading for Elena.

31:08.918 --> 31:10.771
Did you find Silas?

31:10.772 --> 31:12.589
Yup.

31:12.590 --> 31:13.756
Oh!

31:20.697 --> 31:22.766
Oh! Damon, it's me!

31:22.767 --> 31:23.984
No, you're not.

31:23.985 --> 31:25.268
I've spent more time
in these tunnels

31:25.269 --> 31:26.903
than I care to admit
and there's no way

31:26.904 --> 31:28.121
you just came from the school.

31:28.122 --> 31:30.657
Uhh!

31:30.658 --> 31:32.776
Your mind games don't
work on me, Silas.

31:35.446 --> 31:38.582
I may not be able to kill you,
but I will stop you.

31:43.253 --> 31:44.420
Uhh.

31:49.010 --> 31:52.962
I will make the blood
clot in your veins.

31:52.963 --> 31:55.732
I will make every bone, muscle,

31:55.733 --> 31:58.984
and joint in your body
turn to stone.

32:00.437 --> 32:03.407
You won't have power
over us anymore.

32:03.408 --> 32:09.407
Ohh! Uhh!
Oh! Oh!

32:20.657 --> 32:22.609
What the hell is happening?

32:22.610 --> 32:25.429
He can't hide behind
his mind control anymore.

32:25.430 --> 32:27.263
He's becoming his true self.

32:30.584 --> 32:33.018
Who exactly might his true self be?

32:35.756 --> 32:37.189
I guess we'll never know.

32:38.842 --> 32:40.009
Uhh!

32:40.010 --> 32:43.846
Now, this is what I've missed.
Two people connecting.

32:47.318 --> 32:48.869
It's lonely on the other side.

32:50.788 --> 32:54.157
I swear, being invisible
will drive you mad.

32:54.158 --> 32:57.360
The way you couldn't see me
standing in front of you,

32:57.361 --> 32:59.996
or feel my breath on your cheek
as I whispered all the ways

32:59.997 --> 33:01.864
that I wished for you to suffer.

33:05.702 --> 33:08.472
But at least, now you can.

33:10.040 --> 33:13.559
Go ahead, Kol.
Kill me.

33:15.011 --> 33:17.062
You'll be doing me a favor.

33:22.686 --> 33:24.053
As you wish, darling.

33:25.523 --> 33:27.656
How many times do I
need to kill you?

33:30.026 --> 33:31.494
Jeremy Gilbert.

33:33.229 --> 33:34.413
You're back.

33:35.332 --> 33:36.499
Now, what's the saying?

33:37.868 --> 33:39.669
Kill me once, shame on you,

33:39.670 --> 33:41.203
kill me twice, shame on...

33:44.040 --> 33:45.575
Let's leave it at that, shall we?

33:45.576 --> 33:48.377
Elena? Elena!

34:02.392 --> 34:03.559
Hey.

34:14.404 --> 34:17.054
Jeremy.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.228
You need to get
rid of Silas's body.

34:23.230 --> 34:25.554
Well, there's a slight
problem, Medusa.

34:25.554 --> 34:27.130
Even though you
turned him into stone,

34:27.132 --> 34:30.913
if he gets one more drop of blood,
he's back to his old mind tricks.

34:30.914 --> 34:33.585
All right. So, let's do what we he's back
to his should've done to Klaus.

34:33.585 --> 34:35.589
Let's drop his body
in the middle of the ocean.

34:35.590 --> 34:36.840
Bonnie...

34:40.344 --> 34:41.911
I don't know what to say.

34:43.914 --> 34:45.732
You don't have to say anything.

34:45.734 --> 34:48.717
- I was so horrible to you.
- You weren't you.

34:50.187 --> 34:53.342
I know what that's like.
I wasn't me for a long time.

34:55.842 --> 34:57.443
We can talk about that later.

34:59.980 --> 35:01.531
You got some catching up to do.

35:07.905 --> 35:09.205
Thank you, Bonnie.

35:12.609 --> 35:14.794
I'll give you guys
as much time as I can...

35:20.551 --> 35:22.302
But I have to go
put the veil back up.

35:26.530 --> 35:28.938
I should make sureyol's body I
somewhere safe

35:28.939 --> 35:31.627
- until the veil goes back up.
- Stefan, wait.

35:38.836 --> 35:40.361
Welcome back.

35:48.006 --> 35:51.314
- There isn't enough time.
- It'll never be enough time.

35:52.616 --> 35:55.236
- Damon, I'm sorry.
- Stop.

35:55.237 --> 35:58.254
The most important thing
right now is Jeremy.

35:58.255 --> 36:00.118
And saying good-bye.

36:29.653 --> 36:32.071
Good.
You're here.

36:32.504 --> 36:35.459
We need to celebrate.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.991
Yeah, I'm not really
in the mood to... celebrate.

36:38.992 --> 36:43.384
What's wrong with you?
Silas is dead, or whatever,

36:43.385 --> 36:46.069
and you're just sitting
here like a bump on a log.

36:48.847 --> 36:52.643
There was someone that
I thought I would see today,

36:52.644 --> 36:56.729
and... I didn't.
That's all.

36:59.316 --> 37:00.716
You better mean me.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.887
You've got to be kidding me.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.247
Mm.

37:15.699 --> 37:20.587
Thank you for keeping
an eye on this one.

37:20.588 --> 37:24.073
- Uhh!
- Calcified Silas is a heavy son of a bitch.

37:28.921 --> 37:30.881
Can't think of a more
appropriate way

37:30.882 --> 37:34.051
to spent my last moments as
* of person.

37:34.052 --> 37:37.104
Oh, I'm sorry.
You have someplace better to be?

37:37.105 --> 37:40.473
Guess not.

37:43.716 --> 37:47.698
- Thought you were cutting back.
- Yeah, well...

37:47.699 --> 37:50.401
I thought you were gonna
take care of the children.

37:50.402 --> 37:54.570
You heard that?
That's not creepy.

37:57.207 --> 38:02.612
I... Found this in
the dead guy's pocket.

38:02.613 --> 38:05.666
Thought it might do
more use here than, say,

38:05.667 --> 38:07.633
3 miles below sea level.

38:14.258 --> 38:16.242
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

38:18.429 --> 38:19.579
Get the girl.

38:24.017 --> 38:26.353
She punched you in the face?

38:26.354 --> 38:28.155
- Yup.
- Ha ha ha!

38:28.156 --> 38:29.573
Take a hint.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.442
So, you've been back
what, 5 minutes,

38:31.443 --> 38:32.943
and you're already laughing at me?

38:32.944 --> 38:34.912
No. I've been laughing
at you for a while.

38:34.913 --> 38:38.031
You just haven't
been able to see me.

38:38.032 --> 38:40.784
Do you have any idea
how much I missed you?

38:40.785 --> 38:43.486
Trust me.
I do.

38:44.455 --> 38:47.757
Although I see I've been replaced
by another blonde.

38:50.377 --> 38:52.095
What'd you give me that look for?

38:53.347 --> 38:54.514
She's cute.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.666
Do not start.

39:05.225 --> 39:07.111
You have to put up the veil.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.612
Not yet.

39:08.613 --> 39:09.947
What are you doing, Bonnie?

39:09.948 --> 39:12.199
I can bring Jeremy back.
I can keep him here.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.534
No, you can't.

39:13.535 --> 39:15.352
Elena needs him.
This was always the plan.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.820
Jeremy wasn't supposed to die.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.322
It was the will of nature.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.457
There is no magic in this world

39:20.458 --> 39:22.042
that is strong enough
to challenge it.

39:22.043 --> 39:23.827
I have every magic.

39:23.828 --> 39:25.528
I have the spirits.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.082
Phasmatos, raverus un animun.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.701
- Stop it!
- I have expression.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.336
Stop it, Bonnie.

39:36.306 --> 39:40.543
- And I have the darkness.
- Bonnie, don't.

39:49.987 --> 39:53.106
Phasmatos, raverus un animun.

39:53.107 --> 39:55.826
Phasmatos, raverus un animun.

39:55.827 --> 39:58.028
Phasmatos, raverus un animun.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.196
Phasmatos, raverus un animun.

40:10.290 --> 40:12.676
In case Caroline didn't thank you

40:12.677 --> 40:17.414
for pulling her out of that
hallucination earlier... Thanks.

40:17.415 --> 40:22.019
I'm just glad I got a chance
to knock her upside the face.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.919
Oh, my God.

40:25.673 --> 40:29.358
- Who the hell is that?
- That is my ex-boyfriend Alexander.

40:30.427 --> 40:31.944
He's a vampire hunter.

40:39.653 --> 40:41.538
Thank God.
The power's coming back.

40:41.539 --> 40:42.940
Maybe that means
the veil's almost up

40:42.941 --> 40:44.423
and he'll disappear again.

40:47.485 --> 40:49.245
Or not.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.048
We should get out of here.

40:54.117 --> 40:55.418
You should.

40:58.622 --> 40:59.889
Too bad you can't.

41:27.417 --> 41:28.918
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

41:30.254 --> 41:33.856
The spell.
It was just too much.

41:45.352 --> 41:46.802
Oh, my God.

41:57.831 --> 41:58.998
I'm dead.
