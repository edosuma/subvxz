00:25.693 --> 00:30.822
I used to hide what my
vagina did to my underpants.

00:30.823 --> 00:34.117
And, by the way, what all vaginas
do to all underpants, okay?

00:34.118 --> 00:38.287
There is no woman who ends her day
with, like, a clean pair of underpants

00:38.288 --> 00:41.416
that look like they've ever
even come from a store, okay?

00:41.417 --> 00:45.336
They look like little bags
that have fallen face down

00:45.337 --> 00:48.256
in, like, a tub of cream cheese,

00:48.257 --> 00:52.593
and then, like,
commando-crawled their way out.

00:52.594 --> 00:55.054
And then, like, carabinered up,
like, into a crotch.

00:55.055 --> 01:00.935
Like, they're not items
that are for anyone to see.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.938
But now, I'm just like, "Whatever."

01:03.939 --> 01:06.774
You know, I have a human vagina.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.946
Okay, who here just saw my face

01:11.947 --> 01:16.200
and thought that they were at
a bagel store in a synagogue?

01:16.994 --> 01:18.286
Who thought that?

01:18.287 --> 01:22.206
Who stared at my face and
thought that I'm the product of

01:22.207 --> 01:25.584
if a menorah fucked
Natalie Imbruglia?

01:26.795 --> 01:29.297
But the menorah, like, had me.
You know what I mean?

01:29.298 --> 01:31.549
You know, like when two
lesbians have a baby,

01:31.550 --> 01:33.009
and everyone's like, "They did it!"

01:33.010 --> 01:35.678
And they're like,
"But it's really Karen's.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.222
"It's gonna be husky."

01:39.933 --> 01:42.143
You guys are like,
"You're a horrible woman."

01:42.144 --> 01:45.437
But let me tell you,
I agree. I agree.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.317
I, surprisingly,
am not alone in my life.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.902
I have a boyfriend.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.613
Yeah, he's cool.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.657
He's got a, you know, working dick.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.453
Yeah, he's a human male.
I'll put it that way.

02:01.497 --> 02:05.708
But I'm still honking down
on that D when I need to.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.502
Literally, only when I need to.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.336
Like, it's not that I
don't like doing it.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.673
It's just that, after a while,
it just becomes a step towards,

02:12.674 --> 02:15.176
like, getting rhythmically banged out

02:15.177 --> 02:18.387
until your worries can go away,
and you can pass out for eight hours.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.556
That's sort of where we're at.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.101
Functional. Functional, you know.
We've worked out all the kinks.

02:24.728 --> 02:29.023
Man, I think I just heard
his heart stop beating.

02:29.566 --> 02:33.653
When we first started dating,
my butthole was so scared,

02:33.654 --> 02:36.614
you know, that it might, like,
lose the chance at romance,

02:36.615 --> 02:39.867
that it was just like, "Everyone,
shut down," and it was like...

02:40.619 --> 02:44.038
But then when he would, like,
leave my apartment, I would be like,

02:44.039 --> 02:45.706
"Good night,"

02:45.707 --> 02:48.960
and pretend to be so confident in
everything that just happened.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.044
Even though I was like,

02:50.045 --> 02:53.881
"Was that cool when I did that?
Was that cool when I did that?"

02:53.882 --> 02:58.385
Then I would just masturbate to
my worries until he came back.

03:00.222 --> 03:05.934
I would just shut the door and, like, stand
there for a minute and then just be like...

03:07.813 --> 03:09.522
"No, no, no. Don't you
be your old self."

03:09.523 --> 03:11.691
And then it would be like,
"But it feels so good. I gotta..."

03:11.692 --> 03:14.610
That's my butthole's voice.
"I gotta be me!

03:14.611 --> 03:16.821
"I gotta be me!"

03:16.822 --> 03:19.406
And then it would just be like...

03:23.245 --> 03:25.287
That's me walking up my stairs.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.166
Anyone need a barf bag?

03:34.715 --> 03:35.798
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetie.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.800
- How's it going?
- Good.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.595
Am I having a stroke, or does
this soap smell like popcorn?

03:40.596 --> 03:43.598
- You're not having a stroke.
- Good.

03:43.599 --> 03:47.226
It just smells like your hand,
you know. Smells normal.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.520
A couple of other people
are going to another bar,

03:49.521 --> 03:52.148
and I know that you don't
like leaving the radius,

03:52.149 --> 03:55.401
but I really wanna go and have, like,
one, two, one million more drinks.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.820
Yeah, I don't think I can go.

03:57.821 --> 04:01.407
Okay. Do you wanna just go home,
and we can finish that documentary about...

04:01.408 --> 04:05.786
Things have been kind of fucked
up between us lately, you know?

04:10.542 --> 04:13.794
And then you go, and you
talk about it up there.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.632
It's just a very weird
feeling for me.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.550
Are you still mad at
me about last night?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.427
- No.
- 'Cause I told you that I didn't feel well,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.305
because I ate street meat
from the cart at work.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.850
And also, you just said you didn't do
the thing that I wanna do, and I'm not...

04:27.851 --> 04:30.018
I've been sleeping with Kate.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.897
What?

04:33.982 --> 04:37.318
You know, we can't
lie to you anymore.

04:37.319 --> 04:42.072
You're, like, a we?
You guys are a we? No.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.536
I wanted to tell you sooner.

04:47.537 --> 04:52.625
But you're here all the time.
Your schedule is all over the place.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.877
We never talk or anything!

04:54.878 --> 04:58.380
I'm at your house every other night.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.760
Why are you... Stop looking at your
phone while you're dumping me!

05:02.761 --> 05:04.845
Is she calling you? Is she asking you,
"Have you dumped her yet?"

05:04.846 --> 05:05.972
No.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.723
- Or are you just such a dick...
- Sorry.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.892
...that you're looking at your
phone while you're dumping me?

05:09.893 --> 05:11.394
I just don't know where to look.

05:11.395 --> 05:16.273
You don't know where to look?
Well, this is probably a good area.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.067
Hi, Ryan.

06:00.068 --> 06:06.573
I don't know if you're getting my
messages, but I really need to talk.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.495
I'm sorry. I didn't hear the...

06:11.496 --> 06:15.332
I don't care about the beep!

06:15.333 --> 06:20.754
I am also sorry that you
cannot get to the phone!

06:29.431 --> 06:31.348
Kate has HPV.

06:31.349 --> 06:35.727
The kind of HPV where you
get warts on your stuff

06:36.772 --> 06:39.231
and ovarian cancer.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.485
There's a lot of other stuff
I could say, but I'm a lady.

06:42.486 --> 06:46.739
Yeah, and then she dies of cancer,
and you're stuck with the bill, so...

06:46.740 --> 06:51.535
I just wanted to apologize for the voicemail
that I just left on your voicemail.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.746
And I also wanted to say, "Psych!"

06:56.416 --> 06:57.833
Have a great life!

06:57.834 --> 07:03.338
I'll be here with my normal HPV
that one in four nice women have.

07:03.423 --> 07:08.802
And there will not be an apology message
for this apology message. Goodbye.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.495
- You okay?
- Nellie!

07:35.664 --> 07:38.499
You look like a lez who just
got back from Birthright.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.583
Move.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.128
These clogs are yours.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.338
Ryan always hated my clogs.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.216
Well, I guess that doesn't
matter anymore, huh?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.968
You got my texts?

07:48.969 --> 07:52.387
I did do. I'm sorry.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.182
Do you want to talk about it?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.976
Okay.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.395
You're in shock. We don't
have to talk about it.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.856
I always thought that Ryan
was attracted to Kate,

08:01.857 --> 08:05.151
but then I just told myself I
was being insecure and jealous.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.361
And now, all my worst
fears have come true.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.571
That's not what happened.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.991
What happened is he's a piece
of shit, and she's a little bitch.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.993
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.579
Come on up here.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.873
- You know I'd take a bullet for you, right?
- I know.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.667
- Right into my heart.
- I know.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.863
Nellie, you're so sweet
and nice and pretty.

08:24.864 --> 08:26.130
Okay.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.049
You gonna be okay? Do you want
me to sleep in here with you?

08:29.050 --> 08:33.886
I can't do that to you, because I'm
about to turn this bed into a fart pod.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.306
Okay.

08:35.307 --> 08:38.308
That sounds too cozy for me.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.352
- All right, I love you.
- I love you.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.325
- Donna.
- Shit, Gene.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.744
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

08:56.745 --> 09:01.081
No, I'm sorry. I haven't
been sleeping very well.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.250
Listen, Donna,

09:03.460 --> 09:05.628
there's something that I
need to talk to you about.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.755
No, no, no. I already called
the plumber. We're just...

09:07.756 --> 09:09.590
We're all gonna have to
use the bathroom on Sixth

09:09.591 --> 09:12.801
- for, like, a few days.
- It's not that. It's...

09:12.802 --> 09:16.263
Well, there's no easy
way to spit this out.

09:17.933 --> 09:22.102
The landlord's kicking us out.
We have six weeks.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.270
What?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.356
They're closing the store.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.276
That's crazy! That's disgusting!
This place is like a New York institution!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.111
You've been here five years.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.613
I've been here for 30.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.700
Sometimes we just have to let
go of the things we love.

09:36.701 --> 09:40.621
That's really easy for you to say,
'cause you're gonna move to Woodstock,

09:40.622 --> 09:45.167
and, like, buy a bunch of wick and
candles and just, like, chill out all day.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.003
Hey, that sounds pretty nice.
I think I will do that.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.006
Listen, change is good, Donna.

09:51.007 --> 09:55.469
Man, that's, like, the rudest
thing you've ever said to me.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.769
You know, that Ryan,
he was not a gentleman.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.772
Okay. Well, I'm gonna call him right now,
and I'm gonna tell him that you said that.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.774
You're not gonna waste
one valuable moment

10:08.775 --> 10:11.068
of your young precious
life mourning that boy.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.569
I'm a mess.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.447
I can't even be in public
without bursting into tears.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.366
And I think I've cried
on every train line.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.450
Oh, baby.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.954
You know, when your mom and I
split up, I thought my life was over.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.998
You know what saved me?

10:23.999 --> 10:26.292
A long walk with your Uncle Jim.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.421
We walked, we talked, and we
talked about life, and spirituality,

10:30.422 --> 10:33.299
and identity and racism.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.134
And by the time the sun came up,

10:35.135 --> 10:38.429
- we had the premise for our first TV show.
- "We had the premise for our first TV show."

10:38.430 --> 10:40.347
We did.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.600
- That smells good.
- Pasghetti.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.687
- Your favorite sauce, extra honey.
- Extra honey.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.814
I can eat this.

10:49.566 --> 10:54.903
You know, creative energy sometimes
comes from the lowest point in your life.

10:54.904 --> 10:59.199
But, Dad, you had a partner
to do all of that with.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.703
I'm just up there alone by
myself just beating myself up.

11:02.704 --> 11:07.958
Well, negativity will either be your
best friend or your worst enemy.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.502
How do you want to
approach your fears?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.546
Tylenol PM.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.132
No. Living.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.052
Living is the best revenge.

11:18.053 --> 11:21.180
So eat up, and then when we're finished,
you're gonna go visit your mom.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.806
She's worried about you.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.058
You guys need to know

11:24.059 --> 11:26.810
there are some children out there who
don't talk to their parents for months.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.063
- Like, even on the telephone.
- Really? Really?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.564
Not my child.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.359
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.779
You're an aberration.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.614
You're all wrong.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.490
You're the weird one.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.578
You're so pretty. Now just
hold up, just for a second.

11:44.579 --> 11:48.081
- Are you proud of me?
- I'm very proud of you.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.432
You know, an ex-student of
mine started a temp agency.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.227
They specialize in placing people
in the entertainment world.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.561
Pass the duck sauce.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.689
You're about to lose your income.
You don't seem the least bit concerned.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.192
I'm terrified, Mom.
Believe me, I very much am.

12:15.193 --> 12:18.278
But I'm not going to work for one
of your business school students.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.448
You're almost 30 years old. You still
don't know how to do your taxes.

12:21.449 --> 12:26.745
I'm a couple of years away from 30,
and nobody knows how to do their taxes.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.040
Have you spoken to your agent
about booking any commercial work?

12:30.041 --> 12:33.960
You know, I haven't, because recently,
she put her entire body into her oven.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.673
You're never serious.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.426
I will use TurboTax this year, okay?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.636
Hand me the plate.

12:42.929 --> 12:47.099
Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but
I'm in kind of an emotional crisis right now.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.892
I know you're going through
some pain right now,

12:48.893 --> 12:51.145
but you're always gonna be
going through something.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.354
I haven't borrowed money
from you in months.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.149
And I just did that commercial
for the organic douche,

12:55.150 --> 12:57.067
which is gonna be a
real boon to my image.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.486
Well, I'm glad you did the douche job.
The douche paid well.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.155
Definitely, stop saying "douche."

13:01.156 --> 13:04.741
There are other things in your life you could
afford to be a little more selective about.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.493
Your next beau, for example.

13:06.494 --> 13:11.123
I'll never forget that brunch
when he told us his SAT scores.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.668
Mom, really, a lot of people
aren't good test-takers.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.546
You were. And now you
waste that 780 verbal

13:17.547 --> 13:20.632
on telling jokes about having
diarrhea in your pants.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.859
Fuck it.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.991
I'll take three more sips,

13:45.992 --> 13:50.036
and if he doesn't come
out, then I'll go.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.478
I'll take two more sips, actually.

14:14.479 --> 14:21.151
And if the lady in the tan jacket
crosses the street on the second sip,

14:21.152 --> 14:24.487
then that means that
I should go home.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.835
Motherfucker.

14:44.092 --> 14:48.053
What are you doing? What am I doing?

14:48.054 --> 14:51.181
Just go home to your house.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.768
Fuck!

15:04.112 --> 15:06.613
They have a fucking dog.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.490
What were you doing?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.951
Just out doing some light stalking.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.578
No!

15:12.579 --> 15:14.454
What is wrong with me?

15:14.455 --> 15:18.249
Nothing. Nothing is wrong with you.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.043
How did I not know?

15:20.044 --> 15:23.004
Those two are sociopaths.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.340
This is my fault.

15:25.341 --> 15:29.094
I never should have talked about
our relationship in my act.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.806
No, fuck that noise. You know
what is so great about you?

15:33.016 --> 15:35.142
I'm good at folding the laundry?

15:35.143 --> 15:37.185
No, sweetie, you're terrible
at folding the laundry.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.812
What is so great about you is that

15:38.813 --> 15:41.648
you are unapologetically yourself
on that stage every time,

15:41.649 --> 15:43.650
and that's why people love you.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.319
Listen, I'm not gonna let

15:45.320 --> 15:48.822
that mouth-breather and fucking
bag of bones bring you down.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.077
- She's actually my target weight.
- That is gross.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.944
I guess comedy is
supposed to be honest.

16:24.945 --> 16:27.903
So let me just tell you
a little bit about me.

16:27.904 --> 16:31.614
As they say, I like my men
the way I like my coffee.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.575
Disgusting,

16:33.576 --> 16:37.871
like, very weak and bitter,

16:38.956 --> 16:42.500
and cold, not sweet at all.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.879
Very gritty on the bottom as well.
If you know coffee like that,

16:45.880 --> 16:49.465
I'm just like, "What is your number?"

16:50.051 --> 16:53.011
And now that we're all picturing
a very filthy bottom,

16:53.012 --> 16:56.390
I think it's time to
bring one to the stage.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.725
And she's my best friend
in the entire world.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.561
I think you guys are gonna
love her just as much as I do.

17:01.562 --> 17:05.397
Everyone, please welcome Donna Stern!

17:06.901 --> 17:08.693
Yeah!

17:09.487 --> 17:10.862
Here we go.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.156
- Everything cool?
- No.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.118
I love that guy.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.373
Okay. I was in the bathroom

17:21.374 --> 17:25.210
'cause that is all that I have left.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.338
Does it count as exercise

17:28.339 --> 17:34.136
if you are just squeezing your body
all the time super-hard, super-tight,

17:34.137 --> 17:35.846
'cause you're just crying so hard?

17:35.847 --> 17:37.764
Does that make sense to any of you?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.600
That was a rhetorical question.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.228
I should probably turn around, right?

17:43.229 --> 17:44.312
No shit!

17:44.313 --> 17:46.398
Okay. All right.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.235
"No shit" yourself, sir.
It's a swear. Rude.

17:51.779 --> 17:57.200
In case you can't tell from my
deep, deep ridges on my face,

17:57.869 --> 18:04.875
I was recently dumped up with by
a human male who is still alive.

18:04.876 --> 18:08.044
So, good for him.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.673
I feel like when someone does
something bad, they should just die.

18:11.674 --> 18:17.345
But instead, we die a slow death
and watch their happiness bloom.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.810
Doctor's orders.

18:30.818 --> 18:35.322
My very nice close friend
who's such a nice person

18:35.323 --> 18:37.949
decided to fuck my boyfriend.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.869
I would love to just
murder-suicide them.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.038
A lot of people say I
look like Anne Frank.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.999
I would never have survived
the Holocaust. That's for sure.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.335
If you were cool, this could be art.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.212
Or if I were cool.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.923
Is this not working for you?
Do you want your money back?

18:52.924 --> 18:54.090
'Cause the show is free.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.676
I want my life back, but I can't
get it back 'cause it's ruined.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.762
So that is a cost I have incurred.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.765
I'll share more. I'll share more.
You guys seem to be fucking loving it.

19:01.766 --> 19:05.310
Full-blown affair, you know?
Like, who is she? Like, Faye Dunaway?

19:05.311 --> 19:07.020
You know what I mean?
It's, like, "Cool move."

19:07.021 --> 19:09.731
This kind of thing makes you think
I'm pretty good at fucking, right?

19:09.732 --> 19:13.401
It's 'cause she's one of those
fucking girls with a thread count.

19:13.402 --> 19:18.073
This place is a fucking shithole.
So I'm really glad to be on your roster.

19:18.074 --> 19:21.535
She's just going up and
down on his dick so slowly

19:21.536 --> 19:24.996
so that he knows exactly
how blonde her pussy is.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.958
Then I just come in,
and I murder-sui everything,

19:27.959 --> 19:31.294
and then she gets
stains on her sheets.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.300
But anyhow...

19:38.219 --> 19:41.846
- That was the worst.
- It wasn't that bad.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.350
Okay, don't get me wrong.
It was horrible.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.811
But it wasn't the worst
comedy I've ever seen.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.189
That was not comedy.
That was not even a performance.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.233
That was not even performance art.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.652
I think a lot of people learned a
lot about the Holocaust tonight.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.407
You know what the saddest thing
about this whole terrible story is?

20:00.408 --> 20:04.703
It's that not only did Kate fuck my
boyfriend and ruin that area of my life,

20:04.704 --> 20:05.912
but now I can't even do standup,

20:05.913 --> 20:08.290
which was the one thing about me
that made me better than her.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.917
I hate how much you're focusing
on Kate in all of this.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.753
If you're about to defend her right now,
I'm gonna turn into a pile of dust.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.548
All I'm saying is, like, she didn't
trick Ryan into fucking her.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.591
He's a fucking asshole.

20:20.386 --> 20:24.764
Okay. Well, this experience
has been so cool for me.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.017
But I have to go home,
and put on my sweatpants,

20:27.018 --> 20:29.185
and try and hold my
breath until I die.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.939
No! You have to stay here and drink with me.
We're getting wasted. Here, I'm paying.

20:36.444 --> 20:40.488
Hi. Can I get two Jacks
and Cokes, please?

20:49.790 --> 20:52.459
You're really lasering into me
with your peepy missiles there.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.210
What?

20:55.212 --> 20:59.757
I said that you were lasering
into me with your peepy missiles.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.302
Are my eyes my peepy missiles?

21:02.303 --> 21:03.803
I'm not a doctor.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.347
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.100
Both those drinks for you?

21:09.518 --> 21:12.395
Are both those faces yours?

21:12.813 --> 21:15.649
No, I crashed and burned
this conversation.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.651
No! No, no, no. No, you're not.
Come on. No, it's okay.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.279
Man, slip-ons?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.489
What's wrong with slip-ons?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.282
It's the winter!

21:24.283 --> 21:25.992
These are an all-purpose shoe.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.328
For all purposes inside
of your frat house

21:28.329 --> 21:31.539
where everyone's going ping-pong,
and throwing quarters at each other's butts,

21:31.540 --> 21:34.501
and throwing their house out
at the end of the year.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.837
Yeah. Well, you know, that's what
they say, "Go to Williamsburg."

21:37.838 --> 21:41.549
"Welcome to Brooklyn where they
judge you by your shoes." It's great.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.678
This isn't Williamsburg, Virginia?

21:44.679 --> 21:48.306
My God! I've been in the wrong
Williamsburg for this whole time, man.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.684
Yeah. No, I haven't been
to Virginia, but this is not it.

21:50.685 --> 21:51.768
I have.

21:51.769 --> 21:52.894
- You have?
- Yeah.

21:52.895 --> 21:56.272
I went to Virginia on a class
trip with my science teacher,

21:56.273 --> 21:59.192
because I'm a city kid, so they wanted
to take us to go see, like, the country.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.277
And she knew where this
horse had died in a field.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.781
She wanted to dig it up so that
we could see its skeleton.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.283
But when we dug it up, it hadn't
even decomposed at all,

22:07.284 --> 22:09.035
'cause that takes, like,
a very long time.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.205
And, you know, it had
worms on its face.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.041
That teacher should be
put away. That's awful.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.044
- We murdered her that day in that field.
- Stop, it's...

22:18.295 --> 22:21.006
That's the only conclusion.
That's the only thing that could happen.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.883
No, but... You know, she was like...
And all the children ran away.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.512
But I just stayed, and I looked
at its sleeping face, you know.

22:27.513 --> 22:30.390
- That's a lot of story.
- Yeah, it is.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.643
- I like your shirt.
- Thank you.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.396
This nice shirt's name is Max.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.857
Hey. This lady's name is Donna.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.401
And my shirt's name is Brenda.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.695
- She's a loudmouth.
- Great.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.739
Hi, Brenda. Hi, Donna.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.909
Seemed like you waved more at Brenda.

22:50.411 --> 22:54.497
So, Max, how did you
end up here tonight?

22:54.915 --> 22:57.375
Clients. I'm here with some clients.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.128
I work for a computer company.

23:00.129 --> 23:05.425
We design a program that basically,
if you're, like, playing a multiplayer game,

23:05.426 --> 23:08.261
people all over the world, it's like
you're actually playing it live.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.430
So, it's like a phone call,
and it's like you're really...

23:10.431 --> 23:11.598
- So it's like a phone call.
- Connected.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.767
- I've made phone calls. That's cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.894
So imagine that,
but with a video game.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.021
You pick up the phone,
and you're like,

23:18.022 --> 23:21.399
"Hi, is computer there?" And it's like,
"I'll connect you to video game"?

23:21.400 --> 23:24.778
Yep, it's somewhere in there, yeah.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.946
But one of their wives
heard about this place.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.741
So here we are.
Is there comedy in the back?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.034
- Yeah.
- No.

23:31.035 --> 23:34.120
Actually, I had just hosted a show
back there, and Donna performed.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.790
- You didn't catch any?
- No, I couldn't find the room.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.166
That's a bummer.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.335
- 'Cause she was amazing tonight.
- You know what? Thank you.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.003
Like, she's always great,

23:42.004 --> 23:45.215
but, like, tonight, I would say,
she was, like, particularly on point.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.467
- Interesting.
- Congrats. That's awesome.

23:47.468 --> 23:48.802
You do this a lot?

23:48.803 --> 23:50.595
Yeah, it's a habit.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.472
Okay. All right.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.018
Another round? You want
to do another round?

23:57.019 --> 23:58.394
Yeah. Sure.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.063
I'll try it. I'll try drinking.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.231
Okay.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.566
- Perfect timing.
- Okay, okay.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.985
All right. On it.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.367
He is hot, bro!

24:12.368 --> 24:16.371
Yes, he is, but he's, like, so Christian.
He's like a Christmas tree.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.665
So be the fucking angel on top.
Who gives a shit?

24:18.666 --> 24:22.335
I'm not the angel on top. I'm the menorah
on top of the tree that burns it down.

24:22.336 --> 24:26.672
And they're like, "Shouldn't have
had that menorah on top of me."

24:26.966 --> 24:29.634
- He, like, knows Santa.
- Sit on him.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.845
"Santa, can you help me
forget my memories?"

24:31.846 --> 24:35.807
- Yes, exactly. Now you get it.
- I don't think so. That's not...

24:35.808 --> 24:39.602
I'm from a small little
town in Vermont.

24:40.563 --> 24:44.774
My grammar school was in
a barn. How cool is that?

24:44.775 --> 24:46.526
That is cool.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.279
Right? Pretty sweet.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.531
Is that a lie? Is that true?

24:51.532 --> 24:54.909
It's a truth. It's the truth.

24:54.910 --> 24:59.872
Do you think that you can tell when
somebody's wearing a wig or a toupee?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.500
Do you have a wig on?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.668
I knew it.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.962
I have a wig over my toupee.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.630
Can you tell that I'm
wearing a toupee?

25:07.631 --> 25:10.633
I was only halfway right.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.386
Wait till you see my merkin.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.763
Oh, no.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.100
Fuck, it is so cold out here!

25:19.101 --> 25:22.645
I'm afraid I'm going to
get your splash-back.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.230
Is this illegal?

25:24.231 --> 25:26.065
Can we get arrested for this?

25:26.066 --> 25:30.194
Are you... Who are you?
You've never peed in public before?

25:30.321 --> 25:33.656
No. That's not me.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.450
What about pools?

25:35.451 --> 25:37.452
No, no way.

25:37.453 --> 25:38.703
What, you pee in pools?

25:38.704 --> 25:42.248
I've peed in every pool
I've ever been in.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.337
Oh, my!

25:47.338 --> 25:49.505
Did you just fucking fart in my face?

25:49.506 --> 25:51.173
No.

25:51.425 --> 25:54.427
Yeah. I'm...

25:54.595 --> 25:58.097
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

25:58.098 --> 26:00.475
Are you crying?

26:00.476 --> 26:03.769
Don't cry, okay?

26:04.271 --> 26:06.564
- Are you laughing?
- Who would cry?

26:06.565 --> 26:11.777
- You farted in my face.
- I'm... It happened.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.946
I'm sorry.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.976
No fucking way.

29:31.353 --> 29:34.605
I would not hire myself in this.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.190
When do you start again?

29:36.191 --> 29:40.486
I'm on call, which means that I only get to
work if the other receptionist gets sick.

29:40.487 --> 29:44.031
- So we're praying for bird flu?
- That's right.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.119
Cool, I have the dumbest
mirror face in the world.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.287
Please, everybody does.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.664
No, but I look like a shih tzu.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.583
I look like just a little shih tzu.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.751
You just want to say "shit."

29:55.878 --> 29:57.962
You know, that's not not true.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.173
Here, try this on.

30:00.174 --> 30:04.927
Thank you so much for this
flammable piece of shit

30:04.928 --> 30:08.055
that's gonna give me
a rash in one second.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.851
And I also just activated,
like, an old whore's BO.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.562
My boobs hurt really bad.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.939
Maybe you're pregnant.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.911
Hey, is this cute? I mean,
if it had a button, would it be...

30:29.912 --> 30:31.579
What? What's wrong?

30:31.580 --> 30:33.873
Oh, my God, I'm pregnant.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.875
What? No! I was just kidding.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.336
No, I'm late. I'm never late.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.880
And my boobs are
super-swollen and sore.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.465
No, it's just...
You're getting your period.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.926
No, I'm never boob-sore.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.427
Okay, well, maybe it's stress.

30:46.428 --> 30:48.888
Didn't you say that when you
found out you were pregnant,

30:48.889 --> 30:52.225
the one sign was that
you had boob soreness?

30:52.226 --> 30:55.561
Yeah, but you and Ryan
haven't had sex in months.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.313
I know.

30:57.314 --> 31:02.276
Oh, my God! You didn't use
a condom with Pee Farter?

31:03.487 --> 31:05.321
Of course, I did.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.781
I don't know.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.201
Hold on.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.747
Yes, I remember seeing a condom.

31:14.748 --> 31:18.167
I just don't know, like,
exactly what it did.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.003
Okay, look, you're probably not,

31:21.004 --> 31:23.005
but we'll go get a test.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.800
I have to pack up the bookstore
in, like, 20 minutes.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.511
Okay, I'll go get a test,
and I'll meet you at the bookstore.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.513
- Okay?
- Yeah.

31:30.514 --> 31:34.099
It's going to be fine.
I'm sure you're not.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.643
No, you're not.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.569
It's weird that you guys keep
a radio on in the bathroom.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.239
Yeah, Gene has shy bowels,
and it helps him to go.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.866
- Okay, I've set the timer for three minutes.
- Okay.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.286
And...

31:53.287 --> 31:56.914
One line is not pregnant,
and plus sign...

31:56.915 --> 31:58.957
You are fucked.

31:59.793 --> 32:03.170
One line, one line, one line.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.298
Just going to take a big,
stinky shit while we wait.

32:05.299 --> 32:07.841
Perfect. Cool timing.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.261
Don't stare at that stick.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.805
Okay. I'll just...

32:18.645 --> 32:20.896
You're just peeing, right?

32:22.357 --> 32:24.358
Great.

32:25.319 --> 32:29.363
Do you want to hear the story about when
I went to get my first pregnancy test?

32:29.823 --> 32:34.035
It was, like, 2.5 miles between where
we lived and where the pharmacy was.

32:34.036 --> 32:38.247
I couldn't ask my mom to
drive me, so I had to...

32:50.677 --> 32:54.805
If you've just tuned in, you're listening
to the Donna's Brain Show,

32:54.806 --> 32:56.974
and I'm the voice of the brain.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.727
Today, I'm sitting down
with the idiot in question

32:59.728 --> 33:04.357
who, after being dumped and
losing her job, recently had...

33:04.358 --> 33:09.403
Excuse me. May have had
unprotected sex with a stranger.

33:11.365 --> 33:12.740
I can't get your blouse off.

33:12.741 --> 33:13.824
Did I leave anything out?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.701
We used a condom.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.329
Okay, well, that's not what I heard.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.957
Let's do this!

33:23.210 --> 33:26.211
Note the razor sharp teeth.

33:27.381 --> 33:29.215
We should have been using our hands.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.175
No. No way.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.844
Yes!

33:33.845 --> 33:35.680
I don't know any wrestles.

33:35.681 --> 33:39.099
Did you find it? It's a five
second rule. Five second rule.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.896
Come on. I think that
it was more like...

33:43.897 --> 33:46.523
Here you are, sir. One condom.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.112
Might it be correct to say
that you cannot recall?

33:51.113 --> 33:52.655
I'm getting a little dizzy.

33:52.656 --> 33:56.575
Well, you're dizzy because you played
Russian roulette with your vagina.

33:56.576 --> 34:00.495
Did you know that Hulk
Hogan's name is Terry?

34:01.373 --> 34:03.081
It's time.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.168
It's time.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.886
Oh, God, your face.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.764
Oh, my God, barf rush.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.851
Do I have morning sickness?

34:22.853 --> 34:26.272
No, that's probably
just psychosomatic.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.774
Okay, there's two tests in the box.
Let's take another one.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.194
- I'm sorry. I'm going to throw up.
- Okay.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.276
- Did somebody have a bad dream?
- Oh, God, Dad!

35:12.277 --> 35:15.988
That thing is freakin'
so frightening.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.201
I guess I am.

35:20.202 --> 35:23.495
Come on, give us a...
Come on, give us a kiss.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.664
I love you. I love you.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.333
Kiss yourself.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.253
It's, like, 100 degrees in here.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.839
Puppets work best in heat.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.529
Hi, Don. Thanks for waiting.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.325
It's Donna.

36:01.326 --> 36:04.912
I'm so sorry.
Must have missed the "na."

36:04.913 --> 36:06.580
Where are my glasses?

36:06.581 --> 36:08.457
Here.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.418
Thank you, Donna.

36:12.879 --> 36:16.507
Your test came back positive,
and you are indeed pregnant.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.258
Fuck!

36:24.933 --> 36:26.559
Sorry for cursing.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.977
That's all right. I've heard it all.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.481
So, let's talk about your options.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.110
I would like an abortion, please.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.364
That sounds very insensitive.
I'm not sure.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.366
Sounds like I was ordering
at a drive-through,

36:42.367 --> 36:46.787
but I would like an abortion, please.

36:46.788 --> 36:49.623
It's important that you've put
a lot of thought into this,

36:49.624 --> 36:52.918
and that this decision
is entirely yours.

36:52.961 --> 36:56.171
I'd also like to provide you with all
the information you need about abortion

36:56.172 --> 36:58.507
as well as other options.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.175
Yeah.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.137
I have thought about it,

37:03.138 --> 37:06.139
and this is what I need to do.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.266
Okay.

37:10.437 --> 37:13.606
So, based on the first
day of your last period,

37:13.607 --> 37:18.444
you're about three weeks along,
which is pretty early.

37:18.445 --> 37:23.282
In fact, it's too early to get
the procedure done with us.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.575
Okay.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.161
It means you need to wait.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.955
I'd like to set the appointment
for two weeks from today.

37:29.956 --> 37:33.083
That'll put it on the 14th.

37:33.293 --> 37:36.128
- February 14th?
- Yeah.

37:37.631 --> 37:39.006
Oh, my!

37:39.007 --> 37:42.050
I guess we could do it the day after.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.887
That's my mom's birthday.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.976
Can't even get an abortion right.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.979
I'm guessing you wouldn't
want to wait too much longer.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.815
No, let's have it...

37:57.150 --> 37:59.985
Let's do it on Valentine's Day.

38:00.904 --> 38:04.782
Give this card to the receptionist on
your way out, and she'll schedule you.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.867
Okay.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.497
I should probably ask.

38:11.498 --> 38:14.249
How much does this cost?

38:14.250 --> 38:18.295
An in-clinic procedure
costs about $500.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.380
Really?

38:23.259 --> 38:25.302
Sorry.

38:27.305 --> 38:31.266
That's, like, my whole rent almost.

38:32.102 --> 38:36.981
But the cost also covers an HIV
test as well as STD testing.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.732
Do you have insurance?

38:39.985 --> 38:43.862
Well, if not, we can provide
financial assistance if you qualify.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.324
- Do you have Medicaid?
- No.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.869
Any friends or family that can help?

38:56.918 --> 38:59.544
Okay, I'm out of tape now.

39:00.422 --> 39:04.174
Hey, little lady,
is there any more tape?

39:04.175 --> 39:05.926
Yeah.

39:05.927 --> 39:09.804
Yes, there is tape in the
bathroom on the top shelf.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.123
I did the first scream for screaming,

39:36.124 --> 39:39.585
and then the second scream I had from
scaring myself from the first scream.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.753
Yeah, I saw that.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.298
- I'm gonna come in now, okay?
- Yeah.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.177
What are you doing here?

39:48.178 --> 39:49.845
You said you worked here, so...

39:49.846 --> 39:51.721
Sure.

39:54.768 --> 39:58.353
The Savage Detectives.
This book is amazing.

39:58.354 --> 40:01.940
Well, it can be yours for 99 cents.

40:01.941 --> 40:06.361
Hey, I just passed a Mexican
food truck on the way over here.

40:06.362 --> 40:09.864
Do you wanna go get a bite?

40:11.618 --> 40:14.119
When we hung out before, you said...

40:18.458 --> 40:22.461
You said that you could mouth
fuck the shit out of a burrito.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.671
God damn it.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.257
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:27.258 --> 40:31.553
Also, do you remember
urinating in the street?

40:32.472 --> 40:34.306
Among other things.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.016
What?

40:37.018 --> 40:40.145
- That was the main move.
- All right.

40:41.147 --> 40:43.232
If you have time,
take a little break?

40:43.233 --> 40:47.194
Well, I can't leave the
store unmanned, un-womaned.

40:47.195 --> 40:50.405
Of course, sure. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.616
All right.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.618
Well...

40:55.161 --> 40:57.662
I'd love to take you out
sometime on a proper date.

41:02.043 --> 41:04.503
Well, here's the thing,

41:04.504 --> 41:08.882
is that the store is closing down,
and it's a hard time,

41:08.883 --> 41:12.427
and it's gonna take forever, and I have
to put all the books in the boxes.

41:12.428 --> 41:13.554
None of them are in the boxes.

41:13.555 --> 41:16.223
I'm the only thing in a box,
and I'm not a book.

41:16.224 --> 41:18.767
- Not yet.
- Yeah. Okay.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.395
Totally.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.688
Yeah, don't worry about it.

41:27.694 --> 41:30.362
Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking.

41:30.363 --> 41:33.239
I have a copy of this already.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.874
Well, good luck with the closing.

41:41.875 --> 41:44.542
Thanks. You, too.

41:49.591 --> 41:52.384
I can't believe he walked into
the store. That's a sign.

41:52.385 --> 41:54.803
And that would be a sign saying...

41:54.804 --> 41:57.973
Like, that I'm a present in a box,

41:57.974 --> 42:00.350
and that he and I should go and
start our beautiful life together.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.687
- You know, I'm not a straight guy...
- What?

42:03.688 --> 42:06.481
...but my guess is that most
of them would hate that gift.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.901
What? You're saying

42:08.902 --> 42:11.236
that a guy doesn't want
a drunk, pregnant girl in a box?

42:11.237 --> 42:12.821
If you're a serial killer.

42:12.822 --> 42:16.574
Maybe you wanna tell him.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.577
No. Why? Why?

42:18.578 --> 42:20.829
You don't owe him anything.
You don't even know this guy.

42:20.830 --> 42:23.207
Maybe he just deserves to know
that, like, this happened.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.835
That I'm not psycho, and I'm
going to get an abortion.

42:26.836 --> 42:29.504
You know, if I got someone pregnant,
I would wanna know.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.924
If you got someone pregnant,
I would also want to know.

42:31.925 --> 42:33.592
Probably every newspaper
would want to know,

42:33.593 --> 42:35.761
'cause all of a sudden,
some dude's mouth would be pregnant.

42:35.762 --> 42:38.430
My God, you guys, stop
it with the crazy jokes.

42:38.431 --> 42:40.307
Why do you care what
he needs to know or not?

42:40.308 --> 42:42.976
You are the one who has to
get this procedure, pay for it,

42:42.977 --> 42:45.229
wear the fucking pad with
the big wings, okay?

42:45.230 --> 42:47.731
You think if he was pregnant, he would
be worrying about you right now?

42:47.732 --> 42:50.025
No, he'd be trying to get that
fucking thing out of his body.

42:50.026 --> 42:52.986
God damn it! You guys, we already
live in a patriarchal society

42:52.987 --> 42:56.823
where a bunch of weird old white men
in robes get to legislate our cunts.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.951
You just need to be
worrying about yourself.

42:58.952 --> 43:03.413
And why are you looking at
me like that, you little bitches?

43:03.414 --> 43:08.626
Everything you're saying is valid,
but you are scaring my dick off.

43:09.003 --> 43:14.048
Anyway, if your gut is to tell him,
I say do it, because he seems sweet.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.259
I'm exhausted now.

43:19.138 --> 43:22.891
- Does it hurt?
- Does what hurt?

43:23.810 --> 43:26.103
You know, only you would know
if your vagina hurts or not.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.814
Okay. Does having an abortion hurt?

43:28.815 --> 43:34.152
No, except for some cramps afterwards,
but they feel just like period cramps.

43:36.698 --> 43:38.991
Just take me through it snip-by-snip.

43:38.992 --> 43:41.159
Okay, first of all,
there is no snips,

43:41.160 --> 43:44.121
and the whole thing literally
takes, like, five minutes.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.540
That's amazing. You don't even
have to clear your schedge.

43:46.541 --> 43:49.334
No, you still need the whole day.
Because they talk to you for a while.

43:49.335 --> 43:53.797
Well, you don't have to clear your
schedge, 'cause there's nothing on it.

43:53.798 --> 43:55.716
How often do you think about it?

43:55.717 --> 43:58.885
I think about it sometimes.
Once in a while.

43:58.886 --> 44:02.723
And then I get really sad
for my little teenage self.

44:02.724 --> 44:05.308
But I never regret it.

44:05.852 --> 44:07.352
And did you ever tell your mom?

44:07.353 --> 44:10.188
No, she thought I
was at field hockey.

44:10.189 --> 44:14.025
- Were you the goalie?
- Of course I was the goalie.

44:21.451 --> 44:22.951
I'm glad you're here.

44:22.952 --> 44:24.119
You're so jumpy.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.872
You're like an Eileen Fisher ninja.

44:26.873 --> 44:29.791
I wanted to continue our
discussion about your future.

44:29.792 --> 44:33.920
Okay, well, I have something that I
would like to talk to you about as well.

44:33.921 --> 44:36.298
- I'd like to go first.
- Great.

44:36.299 --> 44:37.924
I couldn't sleep last night.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.510
So I made a spreadsheet
of all of your expenses,

44:40.511 --> 44:45.182
job opportunities and miscellaneous
tasks that I think you should focus on.

44:45.183 --> 44:47.851
Okay, well, you didn't
need to do that.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.436
No shit.

44:49.437 --> 44:52.898
I have a student in my office right now,
and I have one about to deliver something.

44:52.899 --> 44:56.067
So, we'll do it
afterwards, all right?

44:57.236 --> 45:03.741
And could you please go through the mail?
I'm still getting your student loan crap.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.540
It's open.

45:13.252 --> 45:14.752
Hello.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.088
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:17.465 --> 45:19.048
Fuck!

45:19.634 --> 45:22.093
I'm sorry. I just...

45:23.388 --> 45:25.763
I'm not stalking you. This isn't a...

45:26.182 --> 45:27.933
Oh, my God.

45:27.934 --> 45:30.519
Professor Stern. I'm just...
I'm looking for Professor Stern.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.146
Yeah. She's my mom.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.440
- She's your mom?
- Yeah.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.443
She's a genius.

45:38.444 --> 45:42.447
Okay, seriously though, she's, like,
the best professor I had in business school.

45:42.615 --> 45:45.409
I see you about to roll your eyes again,
all right? But that's that truth.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.369
She lit a fire in my belly.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.829
Okay. Well, that's called diarrhea.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.458
I'm sorry, but you just handed
that one to me like a little present.

45:53.459 --> 45:56.502
Yeah, you know,
we've hung out before.

45:57.422 --> 46:03.093
Anyway, your mother lent me this
book a couple of months ago,

46:03.094 --> 46:06.012
and I'm just trying to
get it back to her, so...

46:06.013 --> 46:07.847
Thank you.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.224
Come on.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.393
You made fun of my shoes?

46:12.770 --> 46:14.979
These are my mom's.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.858
Do you wanna try them on?

46:17.859 --> 46:19.525
No.

46:20.570 --> 46:23.029
All right, yeah, I would.

46:36.294 --> 46:37.835
That's amazing.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.589
I don't do hard drugs,

46:40.590 --> 46:43.383
but I imagine this is what it
feels like to shoot heroin.

46:43.384 --> 46:45.093
Yeah, they're so soft.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.929
They're made out of,
like, angel's titty skins.

46:48.681 --> 46:52.433
Yeah, and then she said that, so...

46:53.311 --> 46:55.353
There you go.

47:05.364 --> 47:07.156
So...

47:10.870 --> 47:14.330
Sorry, do you wanna go get
some food or something?

47:17.877 --> 47:19.544
Are you two ready to order?

47:19.545 --> 47:22.214
- You know what? Actually, I haven't had...
- Yes. Yes, yes.

47:22.215 --> 47:25.383
We'll each have the chicken
piccata over linguine, please.

47:25.384 --> 47:28.344
Of course. Your favorite.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.638
Thank you.

47:32.892 --> 47:35.101
You are a serious regular.

47:35.102 --> 47:39.564
It's, like, the one place where I can go
and wear my diaper and feel that I fit in.

47:39.565 --> 47:41.482
Got it.

47:42.235 --> 47:45.654
I also don't normally order for the
person that I'm with at a restaurant,

47:45.655 --> 47:49.366
but the chicken piccata is the
best that this place has to offer.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.868
It's the gem. It's the crown jewel.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.078
You got to have it.

47:54.247 --> 47:58.750
Well, there is nothing better
than some hot bread and butter.

47:58.751 --> 48:00.501
Yeah.

48:02.129 --> 48:04.130
Here you go.

48:06.759 --> 48:09.135
Did you just warm
this butter up for me?

48:09.136 --> 48:10.803
Yeah.

48:11.764 --> 48:14.057
That's really nice.

48:16.602 --> 48:19.228
That's just what you do.

48:21.774 --> 48:24.484
Max, I have something
I wanna tell you.

48:24.485 --> 48:26.360
What's up?

48:31.200 --> 48:33.785
I have to go to the bathroom.

48:34.036 --> 48:35.745
Great.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.538
I kind of walked into that one, huh?

48:38.291 --> 48:39.541
Indeed.

48:39.542 --> 48:41.834
Aren't you wearing a diaper?

48:42.044 --> 48:44.129
Yeah, I'm not gonna spend
it on a number one.

48:44.130 --> 48:47.673
- Okay.
- Diaper is for the heavy lifting.

48:52.054 --> 48:56.474
Hey, Max, remember from before
when we did sex to each other?

49:00.646 --> 49:04.149
Max, I love you.
I'm having your abortion.

49:04.150 --> 49:05.859
Do you wanna share a dessert?

49:05.860 --> 49:09.904
Lead with that. Definitely lead
with that. Perfect. That's perfect.

49:12.325 --> 49:14.283
- Hey.
- Hello.

49:22.627 --> 49:25.169
Do you see this couple?

49:26.005 --> 49:27.714
Yeah.

49:27.715 --> 49:30.133
They're incredible.

49:30.134 --> 49:34.346
The entire time you were gone, she has
been reading off the menu to him,

49:34.347 --> 49:37.515
and he points at a new item,
and she just tells him what it is.

49:39.268 --> 49:42.854
Maybe he just likes to hear his
favorite things read out loud.

49:42.855 --> 49:44.772
That's what I thought.

49:45.149 --> 49:47.275
I just love couples like this.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.777
It's not a line.

49:49.904 --> 49:52.530
But I can't wait to be a grandpa.

49:53.908 --> 49:56.075
Man, yeah.

50:02.375 --> 50:05.877
Really hitting that bread.
You're gonna have room for that piccata?

50:06.128 --> 50:08.546
- Two.
- Yeah? Okay.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.304
You got any shows coming up?

50:16.305 --> 50:19.391
I do. I have one
tomorrow night actually.

50:19.392 --> 50:21.893
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

50:22.395 --> 50:25.730
- Where?
- Same place. Always same place.

50:25.731 --> 50:27.732
Cool. Cool.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.777
Can I come?

50:30.778 --> 50:33.905
- Shit. Shit! Shit!
- I don't have to.

50:33.906 --> 50:36.282
No, no, no. You stepped in shit.

50:36.283 --> 50:38.034
- What?
- Shit!

50:38.411 --> 50:40.244
Come on!

50:40.538 --> 50:44.248
- These are my only shoes.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.335
- This is great. You're just...
- No, no. I'm just...

50:47.336 --> 50:49.504
I'm glad it's... Yeah.

50:49.505 --> 50:51.423
I'm just, you know,
just trying to get...

50:51.424 --> 50:53.466
You stamped right down on the doodie.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.593
Okay!

50:56.053 --> 50:57.929
All right.

50:57.930 --> 50:59.472
- You almost got it out?
- Yeah.

50:59.473 --> 51:02.058
You're almost cleared?

51:02.476 --> 51:04.102
Yep. Okay. All right.

51:04.103 --> 51:07.939
Well, I'm gonna go get some bleach,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.149
- Okay.
- Good night.

51:10.609 --> 51:14.320
Are you limping? I don't
wanna get it on my pants.

51:15.448 --> 51:18.950
Yeah. My father was, like,
a funny dude, man, my father.

51:18.951 --> 51:20.785
I think he's the reason
why I do comedy.

51:20.828 --> 51:24.748
He's like a cross between
Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.

51:24.749 --> 51:29.127
He was Cosby, like, in that he'd
hide snacks around the house.

51:29.128 --> 51:31.212
And he was like Richard Pryor

51:31.213 --> 51:33.297
in that he freebased cocaine.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.050
Can I get a seltzer?

51:36.051 --> 51:37.844
What's up?

51:37.845 --> 51:40.471
You're a jumpy little kitty.

51:40.639 --> 51:41.848
When do I go on?

51:41.849 --> 51:43.141
It's what I wanted to
talk to you about.

51:43.142 --> 51:46.227
We're gonna have to end early,
set up for an '80s dance party.

51:46.228 --> 51:50.815
No. Can you just let me get five minutes?
I just wanna do five minutes.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.984
You still doing that
break-up material?

51:53.027 --> 51:57.405
I'm just doing my comedy, which is
just talking about my life, so...

51:57.990 --> 52:00.325
Don't look at my shit while
I'm writing it down, man.

52:00.326 --> 52:01.659
What? No, that's funny.

52:01.660 --> 52:03.870
I think my bodega man judges me, too.

52:03.871 --> 52:05.746
Yeah.

52:06.540 --> 52:07.999
How was Los Angeles?

52:08.000 --> 52:09.334
Nice deflection.

52:09.335 --> 52:13.338
Yeah, I was in LA for three
weeks, three shitty weeks.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.673
I fucking hate that place.

52:15.674 --> 52:18.134
Running around, driving a
gold Kia. That's all they had.

52:18.135 --> 52:19.302
Well, there was a screw-up...

52:19.303 --> 52:21.387
Had to drive a gold Kia?

52:21.388 --> 52:24.140
I did not pick out a gold Kia.

52:24.141 --> 52:28.186
I would pick out a pewter
Kia, taupe, tasmine,

52:28.187 --> 52:32.106
which is combo of taupe and jasmine.

52:32.107 --> 52:38.195
But it now looks like I will be
moving out there for pilot season.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.740
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:41.242 --> 52:43.367
I sold a pilot.

52:43.869 --> 52:44.953
Congrats.

52:44.954 --> 52:47.204
Yeah, but let's get out of here.

52:47.456 --> 52:50.041
Seriously. No, Donna, listen to me.

52:50.042 --> 52:52.502
I'm house sitting for this
crazy rich friend of mine.

52:52.503 --> 52:53.586
I mean crazy rich.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.129
It's awesome. It's huge.

52:55.130 --> 52:59.717
All modern like the stuff when you read
in the back of the rich people's magazines

52:59.718 --> 53:01.636
that they have at the airport.

53:01.637 --> 53:04.305
- Man, I don't know.
- Donna, you haven't hung out in forever.

53:04.306 --> 53:05.807
Let's go. It'll be mad nice.

53:05.808 --> 53:08.059
We'll get a crew together.
It'll be like the old times.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.728
What rap group from 1997 are you in?

53:10.729 --> 53:12.897
Whodini.

53:13.148 --> 53:15.775
No, it was two different
kinds of mustard.

53:15.776 --> 53:20.071
Man, it's colder than a witch's
titty out here. There we go.

53:21.824 --> 53:23.616
- No, did I miss it?
- Yeah.

53:23.617 --> 53:25.118
I'm so sorry.

53:25.119 --> 53:27.662
Work was hectic. I was trying
to leave three hours ago.

53:27.663 --> 53:29.497
That's okay.

53:29.623 --> 53:30.915
I'm actually leaving now, though.

53:30.916 --> 53:34.502
I'm gonna go hang out
with some comedians.

53:36.171 --> 53:38.715
- You coming or what?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just one sec.

53:38.716 --> 53:41.676
I mean, you can come, but I
just think it might be boring

53:41.677 --> 53:45.096
or actually very depressing probably.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.016
Is it just the two of you?

53:48.017 --> 53:49.767
It's not like that.

53:50.728 --> 53:53.270
That's what it looks like.

53:54.398 --> 53:59.360
Well, thank you for coming to
Brooklyn, but you didn't have to.

53:59.695 --> 54:00.778
You invited me.

54:00.779 --> 54:04.032
Well, I didn't think that we
made, like, concrete plans.

54:04.033 --> 54:06.784
Yo, this driver is
getting disgruntled.

54:06.785 --> 54:09.996
Okay, one sec. I need
to go, but I am sorry.

54:09.997 --> 54:11.705
Me, too.

54:12.458 --> 54:14.291
Have fun.

54:18.589 --> 54:22.884
My therapist, this is for real,

54:22.885 --> 54:28.306
refers to standup
as plays. I'm serious.

54:28.307 --> 54:32.185
Like, "You did a play last night.
How was your play?

54:32.186 --> 54:33.478
"How was your play? Was it good?"

54:33.479 --> 54:36.814
- Is your therapist your nana?
- No, she's your nana actually.

54:36.815 --> 54:39.400
- Nana!
- That's why I go to her.

54:39.401 --> 54:40.860
Yeah.

54:40.861 --> 54:43.237
- Dominican woman, right?
- Right.

54:43.238 --> 54:46.824
Yeah, pear-shaped, huge Marley fan.

54:46.825 --> 54:51.162
Yeah. No, you've definitely,
yeah, nailed down my lineage.

54:51.163 --> 54:53.831
All right, well...

54:59.254 --> 55:02.006
Hey, how come we've
never done this before?

55:03.425 --> 55:09.430
Because a few years ago, I rejected you,
and you've been the worst to me ever since.

55:13.018 --> 55:14.852
So cheers.

55:15.396 --> 55:17.188
Right.

55:17.982 --> 55:20.274
Shit. Fuck!

55:21.986 --> 55:24.404
I have a stain stick. I really do.

55:24.405 --> 55:28.491
That's all chemicals.
This is wine. I got to soak it.

55:42.798 --> 55:43.881
What?

55:43.882 --> 55:45.758
It was either this or
the baggy sweatshirt.

55:45.759 --> 55:48.761
Then why didn't you choose
the baggy sweatshirt?

55:48.762 --> 55:50.388
'Cause I wanted to look nice for you.

55:50.389 --> 55:51.681
Oh, my God.

55:51.682 --> 55:54.809
It's gonna be very hard to
have a conversation with you

55:54.810 --> 55:57.562
while you're wearing
that ladies' camisole.

55:57.563 --> 56:00.481
Well, then I'll do all the talking.

56:01.066 --> 56:02.525
What were we talking about?

56:02.526 --> 56:05.236
I don't know.
You just erased my mind.

56:05.446 --> 56:07.488
Break-ups.

56:07.573 --> 56:09.449
Yeah.

56:09.450 --> 56:13.160
I just recently went
through a pretty bad one.

56:13.370 --> 56:16.080
- She cheated on you?
- Worse.

56:16.081 --> 56:20.376
What's worse than getting
cheated on? Think about it.

56:21.086 --> 56:24.005
I mean, I don't
understand how a person

56:24.006 --> 56:27.091
who can claim that they love you,
act like they love you,

56:27.092 --> 56:29.260
say it in words, say it in action,

56:29.261 --> 56:35.391
can then turn around in that
same breath and tell you

56:35.726 --> 56:38.394
that they don't do anal.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.855
For Christ's sake. Jesus Christ.

56:40.856 --> 56:43.107
What? I was kidding.

56:43.108 --> 56:45.193
Are you leaving?

56:45.194 --> 56:47.487
Yeah, I'm gonna do that now.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.113
I was kidding.

56:50.032 --> 56:51.282
Of course she did anal.

56:51.283 --> 56:52.450
You're an idiot.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.827
No, she was Greek Catholic.
You know how they are.

56:54.828 --> 56:58.372
I don't care about the anal
or your stupid loft or any...

56:58.373 --> 57:01.334
I can't even believe I've made it
this deep into this experience.

57:01.335 --> 57:04.670
You know what I think, is that
you should stay the night here,

57:04.671 --> 57:10.009
and we can keep talking
and work some stuff out.

57:11.136 --> 57:14.806
Donna, come on.
You didn't even see the shower.

57:14.807 --> 57:19.268
Donna! All right, I'm gonna
jerk off. You're missing it.

57:39.832 --> 57:42.958
Hi, it's Donna.

57:43.544 --> 57:46.754
I'm really sorry about tonight.
I'm really, really sorry.

57:46.755 --> 57:50.799
I never should have just...

57:50.884 --> 57:55.471
I saw you, and I got very nervous.
I got taken by surprise.

57:55.472 --> 57:57.348
I have something that I
wanna talk to you about,

57:57.349 --> 57:59.767
and I've been meaning to talk to you.

57:59.768 --> 58:02.436
And I don't wanna leave
it on your voicemail.

58:02.437 --> 58:05.857
So, will you call me back, please?

58:05.858 --> 58:08.150
Thank you. Bye-bye.

58:17.035 --> 58:19.495
Sir, can you turn around and
go to Manhattan, please?

58:19.496 --> 58:21.789
You said Brooklyn.

58:21.790 --> 58:23.957
I changed my mind.

59:07.211 --> 59:08.752
Hi.

59:10.088 --> 59:12.047
Are you sick?

59:13.300 --> 59:14.759
What time is it?

59:14.760 --> 59:16.802
I think probably midnight.

59:16.803 --> 59:19.430
What's wrong? What going on?

59:19.431 --> 59:22.224
Mom, can I come in bed with you?

59:22.517 --> 59:24.101
Yeah.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.272
What's the matter, sweetie?

59:28.732 --> 59:31.275
Talk to me.

59:36.156 --> 59:39.867
I'm pregnant, and I'm
having an abortion.

59:42.829 --> 59:44.622
Thank God.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.707
I thought you were gonna tell
me you were moving to LA.

59:46.708 --> 59:49.626
What? No.

59:51.964 --> 59:54.799
God. I was so scared to tell you.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.803
Sweetheart, I know that we
haven't been getting along lately,

59:58.804 --> 01:00:02.389
but you should never be
afraid to talk to me.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.726
I was...

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:15.736
I was scared that you'd be very
angry and very disappointed.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.071
Well, I'm neither.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:23.244
Look, I can't believe I
never told you this,

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:26.789
but when I was in college,
I had an abortion.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:30.459
- Dad's?
- No. God. Not your father's.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.046
No, it was my college
boyfriend's, Robert.

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:37.675
And abortions were
illegal in those days,

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:42.430
so your grandma had to drive
me in the family station wagon

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:44.515
all the way to New Jersey.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:48.436
And we had to go to some
stranger's apartment.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:51.022
When I got up there,
there was 12 other women

01:00:51.023 --> 01:00:54.399
just sitting there in
some kind of stupor.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:58.237
And they put me up on
the kitchen table,

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.198
they gave me some kind
of shot to put me out,

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.991
and that was that.

01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:07.621
Next night, I was dancing at
your aunt's sweet 16 party.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.459
I didn't know that.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.508
You know, I was going
through some old papers,

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.970
and I found this book the other day

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:26.724
that you had written when
you were 11 years old.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:30.269
- I wrote a book?
- Yes, you don't remember?

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.396
You wrote it to me.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:36.191
You sent me a chapter
every week from camp.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:41.405
It was about this little
girl detective named Winks.

01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:45.409
She had a twitch.

01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:49.163
I have a book for you actually

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:52.625
that one of your
students dropped it off,

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:56.128
and somehow it slipped my mind.
I forgot to give it to you.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.422
Max Brown.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:01.425
Is he, like, a teacher's pet?

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:04.595
Did he compliment you
on your alpaca sweater?

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:10.225
Actually, he's a very good student
and a pretty good writer, too.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:13.896
Interesting. Why are
you asking about Max?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.273
There's no reason.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.776
Because he's not your type.

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:22.613
Okay, what is my type?

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.616
- Smelly.
- Mom!

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:28.744
Ryan didn't wear deodorants
with antiperspirant in them,

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.246
because he was afraid of Alzheimer's.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:33.707
Right. I would rather not
remember smelling like garbage

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:38.086
than remember that I'd been
stinking my entire life.

01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:43.092
Yeah, okay, that was, like,
a very funny observation.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:46.511
- Thank you.
- You made a full joke.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:21.255
Darn it. I thought I would
fool you with my 212 number.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:26.093
Hello, it's me again,
calling you again.

01:03:30.182 --> 01:03:35.102
I can't remember the last time I left a
number in my own speaking voice, so...

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:37.688
Anyway, here it is.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.525
I am gonna be at the store until 5:00

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:46.613
and then maybe attempting to
make people laugh around 8:30.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.909
You should stop by
if you feel like it.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:55.372
I promise I won't leave with a
stranger unless that stranger is you.

01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:57.457
Goodbye.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.804
They say to be yourself on dates,

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:13.891
but I actually think that's
horrible advice from my experience.

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:18.687
No one wants to talk about how
Jeffrey Dahmer was actually hot.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:24.109
Or how it's offensive
that I'm not his type.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:32.076
You are gonna kill it out there.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:36.413
I actually have an appointment
to do that tomorrow. I'm sorry.

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:39.708
Boy. Okay.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.337
- What do you want to drink?
- Seltzer, please.

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:45.422
One seltzer.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.555
I really wanna bring the
next comic to the stage now,

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:56.225
because I think everything
about her is fucking cool.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:05:00.563
And I think that you guys are definitely
going to agree with me on this.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:04.483
She is hot as shit and brilliant.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:07.986
Everyone, please welcome Donna Stern.

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:18.372
You guys like my singing voice?

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:23.210
I just burped into this
because I'm an adult woman.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:27.131
I do like being an adult woman.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:29.633
I've always wanted to be that...

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:34.972
I've always wanted to have just,
like, a bra, and a blouse,

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.474
and a schedule.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.977
Like, where I could just, like,
be in my house and just be like,

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:43.522
"Oh, my God, I'm running late,"
you know? Like...

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:46.734
I've always wanted to be able to
be on the car phone and be like,

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:50.320
"Okay, Susan, will do.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:54.992
"What? Okay. All right. Talk soon."

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:59.163
And then just hang up and
not worry about, you know,

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:03.041
why the bathroom
smells in a weird way.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.672
But I'm not here to
talk about car phones.

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:12.635
I came here tonight on a
very different mission.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:14.803
And that is

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:19.808
to say to you that...

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:24.021
Sorry.

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:27.983
Which is to say to you

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.944
that I am pregnant.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:39.077
Okay, all right, testing the waters.
I dropped that one down.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:45.042
The second thing that I would
like to say right now, out loud,

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:47.252
and I'm gonna say it
out loud right now.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.546
Out loud, right now...
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:52.424
Just rolling along with this,
out loud, right now.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:56.929
Is that I am going to
have an abortion...

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.431
Okay, okay, keep breathing.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:02.393
...tomorrow,
which is Valentine's Day.

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:05.395
So, we'll start from there.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:08.940
I'm sure you're wondering
how this happened.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:16.573
A little thing I like to call getting
banged out in the middle of the night,

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:22.787
the heat, heat, heat of the night,
by a very nice person

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:25.833
that I don't know very well at all.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:29.420
I don't know. He was a
stranger, but a nice one.

01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:33.548
Probably the best of all the
strangers that are out there.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.759
And of course you guys
aren't strangers anymore

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.472
because now you're a part
of my life in a big way.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.435
So I don't know if you've gleaned
that maybe I'm not ready to be a mom.

01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:47.730
You're like, "No shit.
You are not ready to be a mom."

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:52.234
And so I decided to get the abortion,

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.403
but I really do love pregnant ladies,

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:59.366
and there's lots of things about
being a mom that seem fun,

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:03.787
but for me it's just like I can't
tell anyone to shut off the TV.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.623
Equaling I can't shut off the TV.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:14.047
I decided to tell my mom,
and I thought she was gonna like,

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.008
you know, be super upset,

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.634
and, like, set me
on fire and be like,

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:19.470
"You can never come
back to the synagogue."

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:23.307
Which is also kind of a fantasy that I'd
never have to go back to the synagogue.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:26.393
So boring. Everyone's
breath is horrible there.

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:28.479
But instead,

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:33.149
she was very relieved,

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:35.944
and she actually ended up telling me

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:40.657
that she herself had gotten
an abortion in the '60s.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:43.160
Which is pretty amazing

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:47.037
because the bushes were so big then,

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:55.714
that, you know, they must have really,
you know, really had to hunt for it.

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:03.514
And I can say that because, you know,
once you get an abortion,

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:06.892
you can reveal who else has had them.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:12.314
I decided to be on the list of the
very many women that have done this.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:18.194
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day,
and I can honestly say

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:24.783
it's not going to be the worst
Valentine's Day I've ever had.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:30.081
It's gonna be okay because

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:33.292
I know that I'm not alone.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:36.755
I'm totally here. You guys are here.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:39.131
You're all gonna come
with me tomorrow.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.553
But it's going to be...

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:53.897
I think it's going to be okay.

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:57.568
And afterwards,
I'll just be in my future.

01:09:57.569 --> 01:10:00.696
And, you know,
we'll go from there, right?

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.614
I guess so.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:04.575
That's really it.

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:06.910
You guys have been very
generous to me tonight,

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.745
and I've really enjoyed myself.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:11.790
So, thank you and happy V-Day.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:15.460
Hope you get all the candy
that you want and deserve.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.796
That's it. Thank you.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:19.274
- Morning, sunshine.
- Hey.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:22.235
You were so incredible last night.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:24.696
He left.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:27.449
I was talking about your set.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.784
Thanks.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.619
How's your stomach? You want this?

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:33.496
No, I don't. I just want this.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:37.709
Well, when you're ready,
I'll call us a cab.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:39.962
Are you ready?

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.921
I'm ready.

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:46.343
Okay, thank you very much.
We are outside.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:47.678
Five minutes.

01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:48.804
Let's just take the train.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.389
No, we're aborting in style.

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.642
I'm so cold!

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:54.726
Freezing.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.354
Have you ever heard about
the people on Mount Everest

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:59.356
who are about to die,
and how that is for them?

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.358
No, tell me what happens to them.

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:02.693
It's not like what you imagine.

01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:04.987
Like, that there are icicles coming
out of their tears or whatever.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.239
The Sherpa is like, "Don't sit down."

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.617
But then they sit down, because they're
so tired that they'll just die up there.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.411
- Oh, my God.
- And all their parkas are still there.

01:12:12.412 --> 01:12:15.122
Max. Max. Max is walking.

01:12:15.123 --> 01:12:18.709
Max is walking up. I'm not kidding,
and he has a bouquet of flowers.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.335
No, he's coming. He's coming. Yeah.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.295
- I can't... What do I do?
- You just... I don't know.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:24.339
- Pretend I'm saying something.
- You are saying something.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.549
- God...
- He's coming.

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:26.925
- He's getting very close.
- What's my face look like?

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:29.010
It's happening now. He's here.

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.639
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.892
These are for you.

01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:37.810
That's so nice.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:45.235
I thought, maybe, if it
was all right with you

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.030
and you,

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:53.117
I could go with you.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:09.092
You can look at my sheet. It's okay.
I don't have any secrets.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.303
Nice.

01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:15.390
Mental illness runs in your family.

01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:19.435
Yeah, we have diabetes
and depression.

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:21.438
The diabetes?

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.440
You guys like to eat a lot
of candy in your family?

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:26.401
Lot of desserts, lot of pie,
lot of brownie sundaes.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.778
- That's darling.
- Yeah.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:36.035
So cold out today.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:42.208
When I looked on weather.com
this morning to pick out my outfit,

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.879
I saw that it is the
coldest day of the year.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.630
Really?

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:52.928
I heard they're going to start naming
snowstorms like they do with hurricanes.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:56.055
That's how intense it's
going to be from now on.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.892
The Donna.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.979
Snowstorm of the century.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.606
Donna Two.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.817
Have you ever watched a
weather report before?

01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:08.235
Man, I got to get on that.

01:14:08.236 --> 01:14:10.987
- Just movie trailers for you, huh?
- Is that what that is?

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:12.905
Is that all?

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:22.206
I'm sorry I took off last night.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.168
I got your voicemails.

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:29.339
I just didn't know what to do.

01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:35.970
I also made a very
extreme move last night.

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:38.306
Yeah, but

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:41.768
it was an asshole move on my part.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.353
No.

01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:47.857
I think we're both just
trying to figure out

01:14:48.568 --> 01:14:52.904
- how to do everything.
- Yeah.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:56.908
I really wanted to tell you when
we were at dinner, but then you...

01:14:56.909 --> 01:15:01.705
I freaked out because you started talking
about wanting to be a grandfather.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:04.291
And you thought I meant,
like, tomorrow?

01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:06.251
Well, you're, like, 76, right?

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.211
Yeah. Yep.

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:10.505
I just don't... You know.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:13.175
We've just been acquainted.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:16.553
I didn't know if you'd
be okay with this.

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:19.055
Are you okay with this?

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.725
Yeah. Yes.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.269
- Of course.
- Good.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.565
I want to be a grandpa,
you know, someday.

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:34.404
- Dad first and then... Right.
- Yeah.

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:50.378
This may be the best/worst
Valentine's Day I have ever had.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:54.590
Which one of you is Donna?

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:58.511
Follow me, please.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.765
Okay.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.192
Well, thank you for coming.

01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:16.362
Thanks for letting me.

01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:19.991
See you on the other side?

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:57.570
Hi, Donna. The sedative
should be taking effect.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:17:00.031
Are you feeling relaxed?

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:16.131
Okay, Donna, we're going
to start the procedure now.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:20.051
Let us know if you feel any
discomfort at any time.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:16.774
- Here you go. It's hot. Careful.
- Thank you.

01:18:25.076 --> 01:18:26.910
Do you want to put your feet up?

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:28.578
Okay.

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:36.085
- How's that?
- It's good.

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:40.715
I made a bunch of friends
in the waiting room

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.633
at the DMV.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:45.303
Oh, God.

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:47.472
We weren't at the DMV.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.099
I got my license renewed.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.892
You did?

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:53.436
Were you not...
I got the car inspected.

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:56.814
You know, I think they towed my car.

01:18:56.941 --> 01:19:00.360
Yeah, they sort of took a lot
of stuff out of the trunk.

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.695
And, you know, for a second,
I was afraid to drive it again,

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.114
but I think I probably will.

01:19:04.115 --> 01:19:07.450
- So you were there? You were at the DMV.
- Yeah.

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.285
That was us.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.123
- Do you want to watch a movie?
- Always.

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:14.749
Okay.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:18.711
Let's see what we got going on here.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:25.968
It is nothing but romantic comedies.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.512
I just hate that type of film.

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:31.349
I don't connect to it.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.225
Here we go.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:35.145
We have hit the mother lode.

01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:38.648
Gone with the Wind is about to start.
Have you ever seen this?

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:40.275
I have not.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.818
I've never seen it either.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:45.655
Do you want to watch it?

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:49.075
I mean, I do, but it's,
like, 10 hours long.

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:52.578
Do you have somewhere to be?
