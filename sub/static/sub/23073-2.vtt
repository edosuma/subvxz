00:08.422 --> 00:11.005
It all seems a little
impossible? (Laughs)

00:11.005 --> 00:12.922
- Most of the women who become
mothers,

00:12.922 --> 00:14.463
<i> don't raise their hands</i>
<i> as much.</i>

00:14.463 --> 00:16.422

- Not this girl. Hi.

00:16.422 --> 00:17.755
Hard to break it up.

00:17.755 --> 00:19.422
- They're gonna fire you, Kate.
- All right, cool.

00:19.422 --> 00:21.505
- Ah, fuck that feels good!

00:21.505 --> 00:23.130
- Anne, you're pregnant.

00:23.130 --> 00:24.797
- Can you just check again
because I had a baby

00:24.797 --> 00:26.880
8 months ago.
She's barely alive yet.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.338
- Was it margarita night?
- I'm so sorry, I don't know.

00:29.338 --> 00:30.922

00:30.922 --> 00:32.588

No, you know what,

00:44.172 --> 00:45.922

Kate: It could be better.

00:45.922 --> 00:47.505

- Look, it could be better.

Montreal is yours.

00:49.963 --> 00:51.755

00:51.755 --> 00:54.047

another kid

00:55.588 --> 00:58.005

away?
- We're not, okay?

00:58.005 --> 01:00.255

for the kids we have now.

01:00.255 --> 01:01.463
- No time. We got no time.

01:01.463 --> 01:03.130
- Hi. I'd like an abortion.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.172
- Can't just walk in here
and order one.

01:05.172 --> 01:06.630

- Wow.

01:14.380 --> 01:17.088
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm so sure.

01:18.172 --> 01:21.005

is in the hospital.

01:21.005 --> 01:22.880

01:22.880 --> 01:24.963
<i> Going to the hospital might</i>
<i> ease your guilt,</i>

01:24.963 --> 01:26.963

01:30.588 --> 01:33.338
(Bear growls)
(Blood curdling scream)

01:39.963 --> 01:43.922
- So again, they just make a
teeny, tiny slice right there.

01:43.922 --> 01:46.922
Like with the scalpel.
It's very small.

01:46.922 --> 01:48.380
And they can just get up
and walk out,

01:48.380 --> 01:50.005

about spreading their seed,

01:50.005 --> 01:51.547

01:53.463 --> 01:56.380
7 minutes.
Takes 7 fucking minutes.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.338
Do you know how long
I was in labour for?

01:58.338 --> 02:00.005
- Uh, about 24 hours a pop.

02:00.005 --> 02:01.588
- That was like two Hobbit
movies.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.172
- But less painful.

02:03.172 --> 02:05.922
- They should do it to all
newborn baby boys, right.

02:05.922 --> 02:07.838
And then if they develop
into decent human men,

02:07.838 --> 02:09.880
and they wanna have babies,
they can have it reversed.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.422
- That is genius.
- Yeah.

02:11.422 --> 02:14.713
- Ladies, a vasectomy
is a serious,

02:14.713 --> 02:16.672
painful procedure for men.

02:16.672 --> 02:20.130
- Yeah, Franklin offered to get
one, but I declined of course.

02:20.130 --> 02:21.338
- Of course?

02:21.338 --> 02:23.297
- Yeah, I didn't want
to emasculate him.

02:23.297 --> 02:25.047
Like a dog.

02:25.047 --> 02:26.880

on you.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.338

I really thought

02:28.338 --> 02:29.922
that you would be more
supportive,

02:29.922 --> 02:31.713

02:31.713 --> 02:33.547
- Sorry, uh what does that mean?

02:33.547 --> 02:35.463
- Because you're both
in similar boats.

02:35.463 --> 02:37.088
You're both stay-at-home
mothers.

02:37.088 --> 02:38.797

I didn't have a choice.

02:38.797 --> 02:41.005

wrong

02:41.005 --> 02:43.172

03:06.422 --> 03:08.088

03:08.088 --> 03:10.297

on them to start,

03:10.297 --> 03:12.588
or dumping them in the trash,
the babies.

03:12.588 --> 03:14.047
- Not shaking them.

03:14.047 --> 03:16.297
- Keeping them out of pools,
