01:48.240 --> 01:52.598
Doc says you had a reaction
to those pills they gave you.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.950
I told him they were
supposed to kill the cancer,

01:57.040 --> 02:01.034
but he says the pills
may Kill you first.

But then,

04:38.720 --> 04:41.633
I saw chaos.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.077
The fracture of peace
and enlightenment.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.071
And I worried,
that the future I had seen,

04:54.040 --> 04:57.158
magical and
filled with light...

when Saigon fell.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.231

28:57.480 --> 28:59.232
And when the country went,
it went fast.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.472
And we had, like, you know,
24 hours to get everybody out.

29:03.280 --> 29:08.673
But not just Americans, but
our allies, the South Vietnamese.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.712
All packed onto
boats and helicopters.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.869
We stood on the deck
and waved them in.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.192
One by one,
they'd land, unload,

29:21.320 --> 29:25.279
and then we'd push
the whirlybirds into the sea.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.350
Damnedest thing.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.750
But then this Chinook comes,
and those things...

29:30.840 --> 29:34.515
Well, you just can't land one
on a ship this size.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.675
So we wave him off.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.638
But the pilot's got
his whole family inside,

29:40.720 --> 29:43.997
and he's running out of fuel,
so it's now or never.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.715
So he hovers
over the deck.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.392
People start jumping,

29:55.920 --> 29:58.116
scared or not,
onto the ship.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.311
There was a baby.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.234
Literally,
a tiny baby.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.718
And the mother just...

30:14.200 --> 30:15.759
Just drops him.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.158
And one of my boys...

30:21.320 --> 30:23.231
Like catching a ball...

30:23.840 --> 30:26.150
He just sticks out
his hands...

30:30.080 --> 30:31.991
So, now,
everybody's out,

30:32.080 --> 30:35.550
and I'm thinking how the heck is this
pilot, right, how's he gonna get out?

30:35.640 --> 30:38.154
But he maneuvers
off the port bow

30:38.240 --> 30:40.959
and he hovers there
for the longest time doing,

30:41.040 --> 30:42.917
you know,
what we learn later,

30:43.360 --> 30:45.510
uh, taking off
his flight suit.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.350
And somehow he rolls
the bird on its side,

30:49.440 --> 30:52.319
and just before it
hits the water, he jumps.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.795
Six thousand pounds,

30:55.880 --> 30:59.077
angry helicopter parts
flying all around him.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.837

he makes it.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.112

his family no matter what,

I didn't understand,

our burden, but...

31:42.480 --> 31:44.517

31:50.400 --> 31:53.392
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.399

someone else's expectations...

32:24.640 --> 32:27.598

32:27.680 --> 32:29.557

have to do that?

32:34.480 --> 32:36.118

of Lebanon,

37:32.400 --> 37:35.995
was founded in Libya in the
seventh century by the Phoenicians.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.952
Then was conquered
by the Romans.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.356
And then by the Spanish
and then by the Turks.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.431
You see where I'm going.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.353
I need a face man.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.951
His details are inside.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.671
I'm assuming you want
more than just a skin peel.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.796
Something structural...

38:04.600 --> 38:06.318
A whole new man.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.078
Like the phoenix,
rising from the ashes.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.998
What'll you do then,
I wonder.

38:15.720 --> 38:19.076
Join a new empire?

38:20.520 --> 38:22.511
Maybe start
one of my own.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.517
So that it, too,

38:26.600 --> 38:29.718
may one day collapse
and fall into the sea.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.272
Do I take it you'll try to get
revenge on Kansas City?

38:35.360 --> 38:37.271
Apprehend those
responsible?

38:38.080 --> 38:40.913
"Cause you can bet Kansas City
will be heavily guarded.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.873
Not apprehend.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.390
Dead.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.116
Don't care
"heavily guarded."”

38:47.520 --> 38:49.796
Don't care
"into the sea."

38:51.560 --> 38:53.073
Kill and be killed.

39:32.160 --> 39:36.040
I had my doubts, but, uh, you
really brought this thing home.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.873
I had a few breaks.
Don't do that.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.839
Take praise and turn it
into something else.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.115
You're right.
I'm sorry.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.713
And don't apologize.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.518
You still got a few
rungs left to climb.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.240
You're not gonna get there
saying you're sorry.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.470
Got it.
Thank you, sir.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.119
(DOOR CREAKING)

39:55.160 --> 39:56.309
I did.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.472
I worked hard night and day
to get this done,

39:58.560 --> 40:00.358
I don't mind
telling you.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.716
Which is why I was thinking,
for this setup in Fargo,

40:02.800 --> 40:04.552
I'd like to handpick
a few men...

40:04.640 --> 40:06.711
No, no, no.
That's the day-to-day stuff.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.274
We got a team for that.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.876
Asset managers, mid-level
and below. Drones, really.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.394
They've already been
deployed.

40:13.480 --> 40:16.677
The real oversight of the new
northern territories...

40:16.760 --> 40:19.991
Well, that happens right here,
in this building.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.116
Which is where
you want me.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.237
Assuming you don't wanna be
a grunt your entire life.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.033
No. Of course not.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.512
Good.
Then pay attention.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.839
It's 9:00 to 5:00 mostly, but
management rewards initiative,

40:38.920 --> 40:42.436
So, nights, weekends,
whatever gets the job done.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.399
You'll be working closely with
the, uh, accounting department,

40:45.480 --> 40:47.471
looking for ways to
optimize revenue.

40:47.560 --> 40:51.793
Shorter shipping routes, less
palms to grease, that kind of thing.

40:53.160 --> 40:57.950
Yeah, and this whole, uh,

You want the old days?

41:17.720 --> 41:19.313
Go work in a coal mine.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.232
This is the future.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.118
Look, you and I got off
on the wrong foot,

41:25.200 --> 41:28.113
but you seem like a good kid,
so let me give you a tip.

only one business left in the world...

41:32.400 --> 41:35.438

just ones and zeros,

41:35.520 --> 41:37.079

you're gonna be.

And I took... Well, you
remember, I took some time off.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.872
And I started thinking...

46:38.080 --> 46:40.071
Which I know
is dangerous...

46:41.520 --> 46:42.715
But, you know,

the things I've seen...

47:02.160 --> 47:04.151
About miscommunication.

Like how, isn't that
the root of it?

47:08.880 --> 47:13.238
Conflict, war... Doesn't it
all come down to language?

47:14.840 --> 47:17.753
Right? The words we say
and the words we hear,

47:17.840 --> 47:19.592
which aren't always
the same thing.

47:19.680 --> 47:22.911
So, I thought, you know, what
if there was one language?

47:23.960 --> 47:28.511
A universal language of
symbols, 'cause pictures,

47:29.280 --> 47:31.920

are clearer than words.

your own language.

you say it out loud, I know.

I worked on it,
