00:00.330 --> 00:01.926
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.987 --> 00:03.888
There's a rumour going around
that a bunch of the older girls

00:03.923 --> 00:05.756
are driving to Jasper for the weekend.

00:05.791 --> 00:07.625
Dad said I could go, so I'm going.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.227
There is no way he would've said yes

00:09.261 --> 00:10.795
if you'd told him the real story.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.630
So it had nothing to do
with possums whatsoever?

00:12.664 --> 00:14.564
No, contaminated water.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.666
I found traces of a
pesticide at Weber's Creek.

00:16.701 --> 00:18.836
I am so sorry. I took Rusty for a ride,

00:18.870 --> 00:21.638
I let him drink from the creek.
I had no idea.

00:24.075 --> 00:25.675
You know what?
I don't wanna go on the stupid girl's trip

00:25.710 --> 00:27.077
with you and Katie anymore.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.246
The last thing I wanna do
is spend any time with you.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.247
Now, she has been gone since this morning,

00:31.281 --> 00:33.916
so we can't sit around and wait.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.985
We need to call the hospitals

00:36.818 --> 00:39.918
and Lou, we-we have to report her missing.

00:41.661 --> 00:42.925
This can't be happening.

00:55.972 --> 00:59.941
I see Georgina
has a history of running away.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.077
Yes, when she was a foster child,

01:02.111 --> 01:04.845
but not for years.
Not since we adopted her.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.047
But it is her usual mode
of dealing with things

01:07.082 --> 01:08.515
when she's angry or upset.

01:08.549 --> 01:11.352
Is that right?

01:11.386 --> 01:13.120
Uh, your father was saying
that you're in the process

01:13.154 --> 01:15.055
of a separation from your husband.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.457
Peter Morris.

01:17.492 --> 01:20.660
- Is it amicable?
- Yes, it is.

01:20.695 --> 01:22.095
There's no chance that Georgie's father

01:22.129 --> 01:24.397
would take custody into his own hands?

01:24.431 --> 01:26.900
Peter would never just
take one of the children,

01:26.934 --> 01:28.834
if that's what you're suggesting.

01:28.869 --> 01:33.339
I have to ask.
It sometimes is a possibility.

01:33.374 --> 01:36.209
So have you been in contact
with Georgie's father?

01:36.243 --> 01:37.743
I've tried to.

01:37.778 --> 01:39.411
But you weren't successful?

01:39.445 --> 01:41.479
Not yet.

01:41.514 --> 01:44.482
You were saying that, uh,
you got into a disagreement with Georgie

01:44.517 --> 01:46.919
in the days before she went missing?

01:46.953 --> 01:49.354
I wouldn't let her go on a
trip with some older girls

01:49.389 --> 01:51.156
on a team she's part of

01:51.190 --> 01:54.659
and she was... she was furious with me.

01:54.693 --> 01:57.328
Is it possible she went on the trip anyway?

01:57.362 --> 02:00.697
The trip was canceled.

02:00.732 --> 02:02.400
Is that your daughter's phone?

02:02.434 --> 02:04.135
Yes. Um...

02:04.169 --> 02:06.404
I've been texting Sam,

02:06.438 --> 02:08.839
the girl who had originally
planned the trip.

02:08.872 --> 02:11.642
But Sam said she didn't see
Georgie at school today.

02:11.676 --> 02:13.243
I'm gonna need you to send
me a list of the names

02:13.277 --> 02:15.412
of all Georgie's friends and her teammates.

02:15.446 --> 02:18.348
And, uh, just a question,

02:18.382 --> 02:20.883
do you monitor your
daughter's on-line activity?

02:20.918 --> 02:22.986
Uh... n-no. I...

02:23.020 --> 02:26.056
Then we'll also need her computer.

02:26.090 --> 02:27.790
Just to check any, uh, communications

02:27.825 --> 02:29.491
she may have had.

02:33.129 --> 02:36.131
We'll do everything possible, Mrs. Morris.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.933
Try not to worry.

02:45.342 --> 02:46.707
Some change?

03:56.512 --> 03:58.308
Where to?

03:58.343 --> 04:01.645
11-1241st Ave, please.

04:56.698 --> 05:00.104
Hey. It's gonna be all right.

05:02.056 --> 05:04.804
Georgie's tough.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.373
Come here.

05:54.918 --> 05:57.354
No.

05:57.388 --> 05:59.756
Directory an individual's name.

06:09.833 --> 06:14.336
Hey! Hey! Excuse me!

06:26.483 --> 06:28.650
Hey, look out!

07:34.847 --> 07:37.214
Peter! Where are you?

07:37.249 --> 07:39.983
I need to talk to you, okay?!

07:40.017 --> 07:42.919
Georgie is missing. Do you understand?

07:42.954 --> 07:44.821
I have literally been
looking for her all night.

07:44.856 --> 07:46.523
And I need you to call me!

07:46.558 --> 07:48.058
I need you here!

07:49.594 --> 07:50.961
Where were you?

07:50.995 --> 07:52.362
I woke up and you were gone.

07:52.396 --> 07:54.196
Driving around.

07:54.231 --> 07:58.200
Anything was better than
laying in bed just... thinking.

07:58.235 --> 08:00.603
I thought she might be at the Dude Ranch,

08:00.638 --> 08:04.440
or the arena, or Maggie's, but...

08:04.475 --> 08:06.809
- Lou...
- And where's Peter? You know?

08:06.843 --> 08:09.978
I have been calling his cell,
I've been calling him at home,

08:10.012 --> 08:12.748
and...
he hasn't answered the phone all night!

08:12.782 --> 08:15.317
Why isn't he home in the
middle of the night, Amy?

08:15.351 --> 08:17.319
Just breathe! We'll figure this out.

08:17.353 --> 08:18.853
I mean maybe... maybe his phone is broken

08:18.888 --> 08:20.589
or maybe he lost it!

08:20.623 --> 08:23.024
I mean, he-he-he...
he could've lost it, right?

08:23.058 --> 08:25.761
Maybe. Um...
have you- have you tried his office?

08:25.795 --> 08:27.227
Yeah, I did.

08:27.262 --> 08:29.129
I left a message,
even though it's Saturday,

08:29.164 --> 08:31.265
and, I mean,
but he does work some weekends,

08:31.300 --> 08:32.667
But it's too early for him to be there.

08:32.701 --> 08:34.467
I think.

08:34.503 --> 08:35.936
But I don't know, Amy, I don't...

08:35.970 --> 08:37.337
I don't know anything at this point

08:37.371 --> 08:39.506
because nobody is telling me anything!

08:39.541 --> 08:42.241
You remember what the police officer said,
right?

08:42.277 --> 08:45.478
Look,
Georgie runs away when she's stressed out.

08:45.513 --> 08:48.080
So she probably just needed
to blow off some steam.

08:48.115 --> 08:52.819
Look, she's a smart girl, okay?
She's gonna be fine.

08:52.853 --> 08:56.860
But Amy... I can't stop thinking...

08:57.692 --> 09:02.828
what if she didn't run away?
What if somebody... has her?

09:02.862 --> 09:07.168
Lou... don't think like that. Hey...

09:09.345 --> 09:10.664
Hi...

09:10.937 --> 09:12.671
Why didn't you call me earlier?

09:12.706 --> 09:15.240
I could have been here in a second.

09:15.274 --> 09:18.876
- Have you heard anything?
- No, I haven't.

09:18.910 --> 09:21.679
- How's Lou doing?
- Not too good.

09:21.714 --> 09:23.715
Oh, honey...

09:25.951 --> 09:28.285
I'm glad you're here.

09:34.826 --> 09:37.227
No news?

09:37.261 --> 09:39.863
No.

09:39.897 --> 09:42.699
I just got back from the reserve.

09:42.734 --> 09:44.668
I figured maybe Georgie
would go and hide out there,

09:44.702 --> 09:47.904
but I scoured the whole place
and there's no sign of her.

09:47.938 --> 09:50.907
I'm trying so hard to be strong for Lou.

09:50.941 --> 09:53.442
But Georgie's been gone
since yesterday morning.

09:53.477 --> 09:55.444
She's been gone a whole day.

09:55.479 --> 09:59.382
Look let's just focus on what
we have to do here, okay?

09:59.416 --> 10:01.116
We've got the horses to water and feed,

10:01.150 --> 10:02.585
and we've gotta check on Rusty,
see how's he's doing.

10:03.559 --> 10:06.522
- Yeah.
- Okay?

10:07.924 --> 10:09.290
Look,
if there's anything we can do to help,

10:09.324 --> 10:11.158
we will, Amy.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.962
Right now, let's just keep busy, okay?

10:46.191 --> 10:48.424
Come on!

10:58.572 --> 11:00.472
My backpack.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.665
Why aren't you moving?!

12:10.171 --> 12:12.373
There you go, bud.

12:12.407 --> 12:14.408
His breathing's a lot better.
That's a good sign.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.411
It looks like he ate all the
oats I gave him last night.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.615
All right! It's all good.

12:20.649 --> 12:22.116
I called Caleb. He's gonna come by later.

12:22.150 --> 12:23.718
I'm gonna show him how to do the injections

12:23.752 --> 12:25.685
so he can take Rusty home.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.955
Have you told him yet? About Georgie?

12:30.491 --> 12:32.893
I will tell him, when he gets here.

12:32.927 --> 12:34.895
Okay.

12:41.601 --> 12:43.636
Amy!

12:43.670 --> 12:45.905
I think we got another one.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.775
Oh no...

12:57.753 --> 12:59.120
Here, boy. It's okay.

13:07.029 --> 13:09.397
Can I help you, young lady?

13:11.666 --> 13:14.133
Who are you and why are you in my lobby?

13:14.168 --> 13:17.203
Well... actually, I'm here to see my dad...

13:17.237 --> 13:20.373
he lives here - Peter Morris.

13:20.407 --> 13:22.508
I'm Georgie Fleming Morris.

13:22.543 --> 13:25.411
Mr. Morris mentioned that
he has two daughters.

13:25.446 --> 13:29.347
Oh. Good.

13:29.382 --> 13:32.350
Jeff Saunders. I'm the Concierge here.

13:32.385 --> 13:35.721
I'll give your father a call
and let him know you're here.

13:35.755 --> 13:39.058
I've tried calling him a lot,
but he hasn't answered.

13:39.092 --> 13:41.426
Maybe I'm dialing it wrong or something,

13:41.461 --> 13:45.497
but he should be here.
I don't know where he is.

13:45.531 --> 13:48.399
Well, he's not answering.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.267
I'm sorry. He must have stepped out.

13:50.302 --> 13:52.670
Well, you can let me in, right?

13:52.705 --> 13:54.138
I'm supposed to meet him.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.540
Well, if he's not here to come and get you,

13:56.575 --> 13:59.611
I'll need to see some ID. Condo rules.

13:59.645 --> 14:01.012
ID?

14:01.046 --> 14:02.713
Something with your name...

14:02.747 --> 14:05.515
Better still, your photo as well.

14:05.549 --> 14:08.619
Uh, well, I don't think I have any ID.

14:08.653 --> 14:10.186
Someone took my knapsack.

14:10.221 --> 14:13.189
I lost everything - my wallet,
all my stuff.

14:13.224 --> 14:16.192
Right out there. I was sleeping.

14:16.227 --> 14:19.562
You slept on my front steps?

14:21.431 --> 14:25.134
This is my dad, I swear.
I'm not lying to you.

14:25.168 --> 14:29.038
The photo will be just fine. Let's go.

14:32.109 --> 14:34.744
Just so you know,
you will need a security fob

14:34.778 --> 14:37.278
to use the elevator or
to exit the building.

14:37.312 --> 14:38.747
You'll be locked out without it,

14:38.781 --> 14:41.516
so I'll attempt to find you one.

14:41.550 --> 14:45.754
Um, actually, I'll be okay.
I'm just gonna wait for my dad.

14:45.788 --> 14:47.155
All right.

14:47.189 --> 14:49.157
If you need anything,
press 21 on the phone.

14:49.191 --> 14:51.526
That's the concierge extension.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.861
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

15:18.052 --> 15:21.688
Yes, I did. I took Phoenix
for a ride yesterday morning.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.723
He was weaving in his stall

15:23.757 --> 15:26.325
so I figured I'd give him some exercise.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.060
Where'd you go?

15:28.094 --> 15:33.173
Oh... I...
my mind's not exactly on this right now.

15:33.423 --> 15:35.100
I know, Grandpa. This is important.

15:35.134 --> 15:38.436
Did you happen to go anywhere
near Weber's Creek by any chance?

15:38.470 --> 15:40.638
Well, yeah, actually.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.080
Hi,
you've reached Peter Morris.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.515
I'm not here right now so leave a message.

15:53.318 --> 15:56.754
Hi, Dad. It's Georgie.
I'm at your apartment.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.989
I couldn't get in at first,
but I'm here now.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.358
And Dad, someone stole my knapsack.

16:01.392 --> 16:03.526
I need you to call me.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.894
I don't have my cell, so...

16:04.929 --> 16:08.164
call me on the phone at your apartment.

16:08.199 --> 16:11.167
I need you to come home. Please!

16:19.375 --> 16:22.044
Call from Lou.

16:25.215 --> 16:28.583
Peter, please pick up the phone. Please...

16:28.618 --> 16:29.985
Hi,
you've reached Peter Morris.

16:30.019 --> 16:32.654
I'm not here right now so leave a message.

16:32.688 --> 16:37.158
Peter, Hi. It's, uh, Saturday morning.

16:37.192 --> 16:38.926
Where are you?

16:38.961 --> 16:43.131
Um, call me on the landline or my, my cell.

16:43.165 --> 16:46.700
Why aren't you calling me back?

16:46.735 --> 16:49.203
He's not there.

16:49.238 --> 16:51.672
There's no answer at his office either,

16:51.706 --> 16:54.540
because it's Saturday,
so obviously no one's there.

16:54.575 --> 16:58.711
I mean, even if he was there,
there'd be no one at reception.

16:58.746 --> 17:00.747
So of course there wasn't any answer.

17:00.782 --> 17:02.149
Lisa, I'm going crazy here.

17:02.183 --> 17:04.584
Hey, hey, come on, sit down. Sit, honey.

17:06.053 --> 17:08.121
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:09.556 --> 17:12.723
I was at the, uh, police station.

17:12.759 --> 17:14.993
What did-What did they say?
Did they tell you anything?

17:15.028 --> 17:17.329
Well, I... I spoke to Officer Radkey.

17:17.363 --> 17:21.099
She said they're going through
Georgie's computer and...

17:21.134 --> 17:23.836
Th-that's all I know.

17:27.239 --> 17:30.008
What's wrong, Mommy? Where's Georgie?

17:30.042 --> 17:31.910
Hey, honey, you know what?

17:31.944 --> 17:34.846
I think we should make your mom
a really nice piece of toast.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.247
What do you think?

17:36.282 --> 17:37.648
And we can put some of that jam we found

17:37.683 --> 17:39.050
at the market the other day on it.
What do you think?

17:39.084 --> 17:40.451
- Okay. Can I have some too?
- Yes, absolutely!

17:40.485 --> 17:43.121
- And some tea?
- Yeah, you don't drink tea!

17:43.155 --> 17:44.487
Yes, I do!

18:05.275 --> 18:10.017
Call from Lou.

18:10.680 --> 18:15.452
Call from Lou.

18:16.686 --> 18:19.787
Hi, Dad, it's Georgie.
You're away... I think,

18:19.822 --> 18:22.257
but I need you to call me!
I don't have my cell,

18:22.291 --> 18:25.393
so please call me on your apartment phone.

18:25.427 --> 18:28.796
I'm waiting for you. Please!

18:51.986 --> 18:53.920
Sorry to disturb you, Georgina.

18:53.954 --> 18:55.855
- Georgie.
- Georgie.

18:55.890 --> 18:59.692
I just spoke with the concierge
on duty during the week,

18:59.726 --> 19:02.328
Apparently Mr. Morris told
him just last Thursday

19:02.363 --> 19:05.498
that he'd be away for
a few days on vacation.

19:05.532 --> 19:07.400
I just thought you should know.

19:07.434 --> 19:10.835
Just a shame that you're here and he isn't.

19:10.870 --> 19:15.007
Must have been some confusion,
miscommunication.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.909
I don't like to think you're here alone.

19:16.943 --> 19:19.444
Is there someone that you'd
like me to call for you?

19:19.478 --> 19:21.213
Uh, your mother?

19:21.247 --> 19:23.715
Uh, no. No, I'm... I'm fine.

19:23.749 --> 19:25.550
You're sure?

19:25.584 --> 19:27.818
Uh, yeah. My-my dad knew I was coming.

19:27.852 --> 19:30.955
I just got off the phone with him,
actually.

19:30.989 --> 19:33.958
He's on his way back.

19:33.992 --> 19:35.793
- He is?
- Yeah. You're right.

19:35.827 --> 19:39.496
It was just... a complete miscommunication.

19:39.531 --> 19:41.865
I'll wait for him here.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.901
All right then. As long as you're sure.

19:44.936 --> 19:48.704
I'm sure. Thank you, Jeff.

19:53.210 --> 19:55.378
Trudie, I'm so sorry to bother you again,

19:55.413 --> 19:58.348
but if you can think of anything else

19:58.382 --> 20:03.218
that-that Georgie might've said or,
or someone she might've met

20:03.253 --> 20:06.788
or... anything at all,

20:06.823 --> 20:09.391
please ask the other girls.

20:09.426 --> 20:11.961
Give me a call.

20:13.896 --> 20:15.931
- Hey...
- Hey.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.633
I guess you know, but, uh...

20:19.668 --> 20:21.970
Dad was talking to the police again.

20:22.004 --> 20:24.439
Yeah, he told me.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.208
They are gonna check all of
the train and bus stations,

20:27.242 --> 20:30.278
and the airport.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.413
They're being really thorough, Lou,

20:32.448 --> 20:34.681
and they're pretty positive.

20:34.715 --> 20:38.751
This is...
this is a huge priority for them.

20:38.786 --> 20:41.688
This is all my fault, Amy.

20:41.722 --> 20:45.492
We had a terrible fight and I... I yelled

20:45.526 --> 20:47.794
and I said things I shouldn't have said,

20:47.828 --> 20:52.931
and... what kind of a mother am I?

20:52.966 --> 20:54.300
The worst.

20:54.334 --> 20:55.701
Lou...

20:55.735 --> 20:57.103
No wonder she ran away.

20:57.137 --> 20:58.770
You know, at least I hope she ran away.

20:58.805 --> 21:00.772
I hope...

21:00.807 --> 21:04.143
I hope nothing else happened to her.

21:05.545 --> 21:09.214
You know why the police took her computer,
right?

21:09.248 --> 21:11.349
What if she was talking to somebody.

21:11.384 --> 21:13.918
I mean, what if she was talking
to some stranger on the internet.

21:13.952 --> 21:16.954
No! No, Georgie...
Georgie would never do that!

21:16.989 --> 21:18.956
Maybe not intentionally,

21:18.991 --> 21:20.925
but she acts like she's
got it all together,

21:20.959 --> 21:25.129
but, Amy, she's a child.

21:25.163 --> 21:28.999
And I'm supposed to protect her.

21:30.701 --> 21:33.803
I can't stand this, Amy.
I gotta do something.

21:33.838 --> 21:36.040
I can't stand this anymore.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.822
Come on, come on.

23:02.728 --> 23:04.527
Hello? Hello?

23:04.611 --> 23:07.503
Mom? Mom?

23:08.199 --> 23:10.601
Georgie! Honey, are you okay?

23:10.636 --> 23:12.503
Where are you?!

23:14.239 --> 23:16.974
Oh, sweetheart!
Just calm down and talk to me.

23:17.009 --> 23:21.746
Honey, it's okay. It's all okay.
Just... don't cry, honey!

23:22.140 --> 23:24.348
Okay.

23:24.382 --> 23:26.282
No, sweetie, don't cry, please.

23:26.316 --> 23:28.818
Just tell me where you are.

23:28.853 --> 23:30.654
I'm... I'm at Dad's.

23:30.688 --> 23:32.756
Oh! Thank God...

23:32.790 --> 23:34.157
She's at Peter's!

23:34.191 --> 23:35.692
But he's not here!

23:35.726 --> 23:38.494
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know!

23:38.529 --> 23:40.730
I've been trying to get
in touch with him too!

23:40.765 --> 23:43.666
And someone stole my knapsack
so I lost all my money,

23:43.700 --> 23:45.734
and there's no food anywhere!

23:45.769 --> 23:48.303
Dad has no food,
and I don't know what to do.

23:48.337 --> 23:51.373
I am so, so sorry.

23:51.407 --> 23:53.008
'Kay, calm down, Georgie, calm down.

23:53.043 --> 23:54.944
- What's going on?
- We'll figure this out, okay?

23:54.978 --> 23:57.546
Georgie's at Peter's in Vancouver.

23:57.581 --> 24:00.548
I'm so, so sorry.

24:00.583 --> 24:03.084
It's okay, honey. It's all okay.

24:03.118 --> 24:04.518
You're gonna be fine,

24:04.553 --> 24:06.054
and I'm gonna be on the first flight there

24:06.088 --> 24:09.123
and I'm gonna be there before you know it,
okay?

24:09.157 --> 24:12.359
- Okay.
- Don't leave the apartment.

24:12.394 --> 24:14.662
Promise me. Just stay where you are, okay?

24:14.697 --> 24:17.831
Okay. Yeah, I promise.

24:17.865 --> 24:19.265
Please hurry.

24:19.300 --> 24:21.201
All right, I'll see you soon.

24:21.235 --> 24:24.404
- Okay. I love you.
- Oh, I love you.

24:24.438 --> 24:25.806
Bye, honey.

24:27.241 --> 24:31.011
She's safe. She's at Peter's.

24:31.045 --> 24:33.579
- She's fine. Oh...
- All right, okay.

24:33.614 --> 24:36.148
Well, that's... that's, that's news.

24:36.182 --> 24:39.919
- I was so scared.
- Such good news, honey.

24:39.953 --> 24:41.587
Okay, well, where the hell is Peter?

24:41.622 --> 24:43.823
I don't know.
I need to get on a flight. I need to...

24:43.857 --> 24:45.591
I will book you one. Where's your computer?

24:45.626 --> 24:47.593
- In my room.
- We'll drive you to the airport.

24:47.628 --> 24:49.294
No, no, no. I'm just-I'm gonna go,

24:49.329 --> 24:51.630
I'm gonna drive myself and
leave my car at the airport.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.048
You shouldn't drive. You shouldn't, honey.

24:53.101 --> 24:53.628
You're in no condition.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.567
I'm driving!
I'm finally able to do something!

25:00.773 --> 25:03.608
I'm gonna call the police.

25:06.612 --> 25:08.846
So she's been gone since yesterday?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.681
I mean, why didn't anybody tell me?

25:10.715 --> 25:12.983
I c-could've started a
search party or something.

25:13.018 --> 25:14.885
Well, the police were handling it, Caleb.

25:14.919 --> 25:16.319
Yeah, that was the worst part;

25:16.354 --> 25:17.688
there was really nothing we could do.

25:17.722 --> 25:20.423
But she's fine, right? I mean, you're sure?

25:20.458 --> 25:22.693
Yeah. Lou's on her way to the airport.

25:22.727 --> 25:24.560
Crazy kid.

25:26.335 --> 25:27.429
- Life.
- Mm.

25:27.464 --> 25:29.632
You just never know what
it's gonna throw at you?

25:29.667 --> 25:31.067
I mean, look at Rusty and Phoenix.

25:31.101 --> 25:32.669
Some idiot spreading poison.

25:32.703 --> 25:35.638
Yeah.
The good news is that Rusty is much better.

25:35.673 --> 25:37.940
You know, the injections are,
are really working.

25:37.975 --> 25:42.210
Yeah, he uh...
seems pretty much back to his old self.

25:44.246 --> 25:47.448
Thank you. You guys have been amazing.

25:47.483 --> 25:50.285
I don't know how you cope with all this.

25:50.319 --> 25:52.220
How's Phoenix?

25:52.254 --> 25:55.057
He's not doing too good.
He's worse off than Rusty was

25:55.091 --> 25:58.425
and he's not responding
quickly to the treatments,

25:58.459 --> 26:00.460
so we're just standing by right now.

26:00.495 --> 26:02.830
- Caleb.
- Jack.

26:02.864 --> 26:05.465
So Ty, I want to see where
that poison got into the water.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.201
If someone dumped it,

26:07.235 --> 26:08.903
we need to get to the bottom of it.

26:08.937 --> 26:11.872
I should be actually staying
here with Phoenix though.

26:11.907 --> 26:14.175
I get that you and Amy are tied up here,

26:14.209 --> 26:16.409
so just give me directions and I'll...

26:16.443 --> 26:18.144
do a little investigation.

26:18.179 --> 26:19.612
Oh, I'm coming with you.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.015
Whoever did this nearly killed my horse.

26:22.049 --> 26:23.549
Lou called. She made her flight.

26:23.584 --> 26:24.951
They just took off.

26:24.985 --> 26:26.452
- Good. That's good.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:26.486 --> 26:27.854
How you doin'? You okay?

26:27.888 --> 26:30.356
No. I'm a basket case.

26:30.390 --> 26:32.524
I'm not gonna be able to relax until
we know that she's in Vancouver,

26:32.558 --> 26:34.126
so I-I gotta stay busy.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.627
Well, we've got another problem

26:35.661 --> 26:37.262
that's gonna keeps us all busy,

26:37.296 --> 26:38.864
so go saddle up.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.966
Well...

26:41.000 --> 26:43.535
Here, take that too.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.414
Right there.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.857
You comin'?

27:22.539 --> 27:24.273
This way, Mrs. Morris.

27:24.307 --> 27:25.775
Good to see you again. Thank you.

27:25.809 --> 27:27.810
I am so sorry. If I had only known

27:27.844 --> 27:29.779
I would have contacted you immediately.

27:29.813 --> 27:31.446
- But your daughter was so confident.
- No.

27:31.481 --> 27:33.315
So sure of herself, nothing seemed amiss.

27:33.349 --> 27:35.217
Jeff, this isn't your fault.

27:35.252 --> 27:38.854
She told me that Mr.
Morris wa-was on his way.

27:38.889 --> 27:40.822
Look, I know, I just...

27:40.856 --> 27:44.292
- I need to get to my daughter.
- Of course.

28:01.075 --> 28:03.010
I'm so sorry.

28:04.445 --> 28:07.614
You're safe. That's all that matters.

28:13.354 --> 28:16.189
That's all that matters.

28:24.264 --> 28:27.033
I don't see any sign of
contaminate in that water.

28:27.067 --> 28:29.836
Yeah. The stream looks pretty clear.

28:29.870 --> 28:32.537
I guess the guy wasn't much into recycling.

28:41.814 --> 28:43.614
Hey, Jack?

28:43.649 --> 28:46.551
Here's the source.

28:46.585 --> 28:48.552
Potato beetle pesticide.

28:48.586 --> 28:51.521
See, that...
that stuff has been banned for years.

28:51.556 --> 28:52.990
Yeah, and somebody must have hung onto it

28:53.024 --> 28:54.391
and finally dumped it here.

28:54.425 --> 28:56.227
It's all leeching into the stream.

28:56.261 --> 28:58.863
This is Provincial Park land.
Nobody lives up here.

28:58.897 --> 29:01.698
Somebody just figured it was
his own private dumping ground.

29:01.733 --> 29:04.301
Well, let's find out who that idiot is.

29:04.336 --> 29:06.102
Well, how are we gonna do that?

29:06.136 --> 29:08.104
Let's get our hands dirty, boys.

29:08.138 --> 29:10.773
Like, uh, looking for evidence?

29:11.997 --> 29:15.378
Yeah. Just like that, Caleb.
You get to be a detective.

29:19.316 --> 29:21.384
I'm really sorry. I should've told you.

29:21.418 --> 29:24.116
I... I really messed up.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.622
Yeah. You did.

29:27.656 --> 29:30.993
Everyone was in a complete panic.

29:33.192 --> 29:35.764
Why did you do it, Georgie?

29:35.798 --> 29:38.200
I want to know.

29:38.234 --> 29:40.434
I don't know.

29:40.468 --> 29:44.272
All of a sudden, I just felt kinda...
trapped.

29:44.306 --> 29:47.208
Trapped?

29:47.242 --> 29:51.645
Like if I didn't run, I wouldn't get out.

29:51.679 --> 29:53.981
- Why?
- I don't know.

29:54.016 --> 29:58.051
Sometimes I feel that way... for no reason.

29:58.085 --> 30:01.221
Especially when I'm angry.

30:01.255 --> 30:04.224
I just feel like I need to... escape.

30:05.692 --> 30:09.562
Okay. Maybe we should talk about that.

30:09.596 --> 30:13.966
You know, try to figure it out.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.803
And listen,
I'm sorry that I went as far as I did.

30:17.837 --> 30:22.141
I guess that's what I do when I get angry.

30:22.175 --> 30:24.276
And I'm sorry that those
girls all blame you.

30:24.311 --> 30:26.878
That's... pretty much my fault.

30:26.913 --> 30:29.381
No, it wasn't. You had to call Trudie.

30:29.416 --> 30:32.516
That's what moms do. You're suppose to.

30:32.551 --> 30:34.452
I guess.

30:35.854 --> 30:41.099
But listen, Georgie, we're a family, okay?

30:41.860 --> 30:45.162
So don't ever do this again.

30:45.831 --> 30:47.797
You have to promise.

30:47.832 --> 30:50.367
You know what? Even if you're angry

30:50.401 --> 30:55.293
or if we're both really angry,
you can't just run.

30:56.007 --> 30:58.875
You can't just... disappear like that

30:58.909 --> 31:04.213
'cause... I have never been so
terrified in my entire life.

31:04.247 --> 31:06.343
Do you understand?

31:07.084 --> 31:09.018
Do you promise me?

31:11.989 --> 31:14.357
Say it.

31:14.391 --> 31:15.757
I promise.

31:17.627 --> 31:18.995
I was pretty terrified too,

31:19.029 --> 31:21.329
especially when my knapsack was stolen.

31:21.364 --> 31:23.931
Okay, I don't really need or want to hear

31:23.966 --> 31:26.468
anymore about that right now.

31:26.502 --> 31:29.537
You can tell me all the
gritty details later.

31:29.571 --> 31:32.273
I think you and I could use a little time

31:32.308 --> 31:34.409
before we head back.

31:34.443 --> 31:35.776
What do you say?

31:35.811 --> 31:39.213
We could go for a walk by the ocean,
grab some sushi.

31:39.247 --> 31:40.780
Just me and you.

31:41.378 --> 31:42.549
Okay.

31:46.221 --> 31:49.756
Peter! Honey, are you back?

31:56.058 --> 31:59.900
Hi, I'm Sylvia Pratt.

32:01.968 --> 32:03.925
Sylvia...

32:11.508 --> 32:14.976
You must be Lou. And of course, Georgie.

32:15.011 --> 32:16.644
Um... I feel like I...

32:16.679 --> 32:18.746
I mean,
Peter never stops talking about you.

32:18.780 --> 32:20.472
Both of you.

32:21.850 --> 32:25.253
When you came in,
you asked if Peter was "back"?

32:25.287 --> 32:27.422
Does that mean he's away?

32:27.456 --> 32:30.858
Yes. Uh, he went sailing for a
couple of days with some buddies.

32:30.892 --> 32:32.594
Oh.

32:32.628 --> 32:35.862
I'm just here to, you know,
water the plants.

32:35.896 --> 32:37.564
So that must explain why you have a key

32:37.599 --> 32:39.933
to my husband's apartment.

32:41.603 --> 32:43.974
There aren't any plants here.

32:44.872 --> 32:47.953
You're right, Georgie. There aren't.

32:48.723 --> 32:52.411
Well, um...
I'm sure Peter will be home quite soon,

32:52.446 --> 32:55.348
so... I should get going.

32:55.382 --> 32:57.015
I hope you have a nice visit.

32:57.050 --> 32:59.785
It was lovely to meet you both.

33:09.828 --> 33:13.365
I don't think we need to spend
any more time here, do you?

33:13.867 --> 33:16.134
Let's hop on a flight back home.

33:58.041 --> 33:59.508
Ugh!

34:04.146 --> 34:08.650
Hey. Hey, hey. This is it.
Same address, same name.

34:08.685 --> 34:11.085
Archie Buchanan.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.656
Yeah. Yeah, look at that.
That could be our guy.

34:25.132 --> 34:28.001
Scott, he's not responding like he should.

34:28.036 --> 34:31.385
Are there any other treatments
that I should be trying, you know?

34:32.106 --> 34:35.742
He can't eat or-or drink.
He can't even swallow.

34:36.219 --> 34:37.909
Yeah, I got him on fluids.

34:40.516 --> 34:42.047
Okay.

34:57.430 --> 34:59.531
Is there a problem?

34:59.566 --> 35:01.367
There might be a big problem, yeah.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.868
Are you Archie Buchanan?

35:02.902 --> 35:05.203
Yeah. So?

35:05.238 --> 35:07.805
You grow potatoes, Archie?

35:07.840 --> 35:09.273
Best in the area.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.376
Well, Archie,
we found some of your old mail

35:11.410 --> 35:16.213
at your personal dump
site up at Weber's Creek.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.182
That's your name and address, right?

35:18.216 --> 35:20.685
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.587
How 'bout now? Ring a bell?

35:26.457 --> 35:29.393
Never saw that before. What is it?

35:29.427 --> 35:32.195
That's a pesticide.
It's been banned for years.

35:32.229 --> 35:35.499
But then again,
I guess some people keep using it.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.668
Oh, it must work really well
on those pesky potato bugs,

35:38.703 --> 35:40.069
right, Jack?

35:40.104 --> 35:41.970
Say, you mind if I have look around?

35:42.005 --> 35:44.774
I want you off my property now!

35:44.808 --> 35:46.442
Go ahead, Caleb.

35:46.476 --> 35:47.976
I'll call the cops!

35:48.011 --> 35:51.881
If you call the cops,
okay,

35:51.915 --> 35:53.816
We'll just take them straight
to your personal dump site

35:53.850 --> 35:55.718
and we'll show them that
poison

35:55.752 --> 35:57.219
that you've been putting into that Creek

35:57.253 --> 35:58.653
for God knows how long!

35:58.687 --> 36:00.154
That's poisoned two of our horses,

36:00.188 --> 36:03.224
one of whom is still fighting for his life.

36:03.258 --> 36:06.160
- Ow!
- Call the cops. Call the cops.

36:06.194 --> 36:07.929
So if I were you,

36:07.963 --> 36:09.964
I'd head down to that Creek right about now

36:09.998 --> 36:12.734
and start cleaning up that mess of yours

36:12.768 --> 36:15.309
before you make anymore animals sick.

36:15.974 --> 36:19.873
And now, I mean, we know where you live...

36:19.908 --> 36:22.476
It'd be a real shame to have to
come back here for another visit,

36:22.510 --> 36:24.210
'cause we'll be checking.

36:24.245 --> 36:25.879
You recognize it?

36:25.914 --> 36:28.715
There's about a dozen
more in your back shed.

36:35.756 --> 36:39.559
That's for nearly killing one of my horses.

37:03.048 --> 37:06.216
Oh, Georgie! I'm so glad to see you.

37:08.820 --> 37:10.320
You...

37:12.323 --> 37:13.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:17.095 --> 37:19.730
I'm sorry I put you guys through that.

37:22.233 --> 37:23.700
What's wrong?

37:23.734 --> 37:27.504
Phoenix is sick, Georgie.
He's not doing well.

37:27.538 --> 37:28.905
Well, what's wrong? Where is he?

37:44.115 --> 37:46.584
Okay. Hi, Phoenix. Hi, baby.

37:49.287 --> 37:50.655
It's okay.

37:50.689 --> 37:52.690
Come here, you gotta get better.

37:52.724 --> 37:55.026
You gotta get better, buddy.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.628
Come on, you gotta drink this. Come on.

37:59.063 --> 38:00.530
Good boy.

38:00.565 --> 38:03.132
Good boy. Ty, he's doing it.

38:03.167 --> 38:04.568
- Good.
- He's drinking.

38:04.602 --> 38:08.104
Keep trying, Georgie, okay?
His breathing's easing up.

38:08.138 --> 38:10.139
He can tell you're back, Georgie.

38:10.174 --> 38:11.875
He's feeling better already.

38:15.773 --> 38:17.546
Well, how's he doing?

38:17.581 --> 38:19.848
He's definitely improving.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.489
Uh, Georgie, could I have a minute?

38:28.892 --> 38:30.593
Yeah, sure.

38:36.198 --> 38:38.666
Good boy.

38:40.971 --> 38:42.837
Phoenix never would've gotten sick

38:42.871 --> 38:45.006
if I hadn't run away. I know that,

38:45.040 --> 38:46.507
and I'm really, really sorry.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.242
It was a stupid thing to do.

38:48.276 --> 38:52.613
You're right. It was a stupid thing to do.

38:53.034 --> 38:56.178
But you should know that...

38:56.918 --> 39:00.787
I'm the one who let that
guy drink out of that creek.

39:00.822 --> 39:02.188
And I should've been more in touch

39:02.223 --> 39:05.125
with what Amy and Ty were coping with,
with Rusty.

39:05.159 --> 39:07.159
No, this is not your fault at all.

39:07.193 --> 39:08.894
Well, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't,

39:08.929 --> 39:11.063
but it doesn't matter now.

39:12.966 --> 39:15.901
And Georgie, I'm only gonna say this once.

39:16.986 --> 39:22.174
I hope you never put any of us through
something like this again. Ever.

39:22.208 --> 39:25.176
- I won't. I...
- I'm not finished.

39:27.546 --> 39:31.282
Now, I don't know what goes on
in that mind of yours sometimes

39:31.316 --> 39:34.653
or what kinda stuff you
dredge up from your past,

39:34.687 --> 39:37.288
but I think it's high time you
figured out once and for all,

39:37.322 --> 39:39.090
that your running days are over,
young lady.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.992
You're too old for that kinda crap.

39:45.664 --> 39:47.965
You understand me?

39:54.238 --> 39:56.473
I'm sorry, Jack.

40:12.956 --> 40:15.423
Hey, who needs power?

40:27.203 --> 40:30.670
- Poor Lou.
- Yeah.

40:32.607 --> 40:36.077
What a thing to have to go through.

40:36.111 --> 40:38.412
I don't know what I would do
if Georgie was my daughter.

40:38.446 --> 40:41.982
I don't know what I would
do if Peter was my husband.

40:42.017 --> 40:44.585
Well, he was away, Amy.

40:44.619 --> 40:48.388
Yeah, but he could've at least called,
you know?

40:48.423 --> 40:50.489
He could've let her know.

40:50.524 --> 40:53.226
She was trying to reach him, Ty.

40:53.260 --> 40:55.494
- He wasn't there for her.
- Mm.

40:58.099 --> 41:00.867
Well, I'll be there for you.

41:00.901 --> 41:02.802
You'd better.

41:04.872 --> 41:08.640
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

41:19.285 --> 41:21.220
His fever's gone down

41:21.254 --> 41:23.320
and his breathing's getting a lot better.

41:23.355 --> 41:26.257
That's great.

41:28.227 --> 41:30.228
You didn't have to come out here though.

41:30.262 --> 41:32.475
Are you kidding me?

41:33.832 --> 41:36.868
I am not letting you out of my sight.

41:41.639 --> 41:43.539
Has Peter called?

41:46.477 --> 41:49.470
Wherever he is, he mustn't have reception.

41:50.768 --> 41:54.682
He would have, Georgie, if he could.

41:55.787 --> 41:57.447
I know it.

42:02.659 --> 42:05.094
I changed my mind.

42:05.128 --> 42:08.152
I wanna come with you
and Katie on that trip

42:08.395 --> 42:10.465
if that's still okay.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.434
It's more than okay.

42:14.536 --> 42:17.138
Just me and my girls.

42:23.946 --> 42:26.047
Georgie?!

42:28.217 --> 42:31.651
Georgie, honey, are you here?

42:35.089 --> 42:37.124
Georgie!

42:42.663 --> 42:44.664
Hey, Lou, it's-it's Peter!

42:44.699 --> 42:46.533
Uh, I got all your messages. I am sorry.

42:46.567 --> 42:48.400
I-I was... I was away sailing

42:48.435 --> 42:50.036
and my phone didn't get any service!

42:50.070 --> 42:53.072
Um... was Georgie here in my apartment?

42:53.106 --> 42:56.342
Because she's not here now! So, um...

42:56.376 --> 42:57.877
I don't know what's going on

42:57.911 --> 42:59.411
and I really need to know that she's okay.

42:59.446 --> 43:02.414
So can you-can you just call me back?
Please?

43:02.449 --> 43:04.750
Uh, where are you?

43:04.784 --> 43:07.018
Call me, okay? Thanks.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.714
Is there any coffee left?

43:37.716 --> 43:39.499
Jack snores, so.

43:39.815 --> 43:40.343
I know.

43:40.407 --> 43:41.717
Cattle drive

43:41.719 --> 43:43.119
and corn maze.

43:43.121 --> 43:44.220
What could go wrong?

43:44.222 --> 43:45.889
Maybe we should have
grabbed one of those maps,

43:45.891 --> 43:46.722
you think?

43:46.724 --> 43:47.556
Heartland,
