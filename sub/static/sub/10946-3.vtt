WEBVTT

00:01.483 --> 00:03.252
Let's see what we got.

00:03.286 --> 00:05.587
Whoa!

00:05.622 --> 00:08.824
If you wanna join me in
hotshots, I'll consider it.

00:08.858 --> 00:11.159
No. We don't need any help.

00:11.193 --> 00:14.530
<i>- Look at this.</i>
<i>- There's Amy.</i>

00:14.564 --> 00:17.065
Oh my God.

00:17.099 --> 00:20.536
Sometimes these Internet things,
they aren't what they seem.

00:20.570 --> 00:21.703
It looks like "Hooves For Hope"
might be a scam.

00:21.738 --> 00:24.006
You ruin everything!

00:24.040 --> 00:26.074
He kissed me.

00:26.108 --> 00:27.875
Then I told him to back off,
that he had crossed a line,

00:27.910 --> 00:30.211
and he said he was sorry.
And it happened that fast.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:42.390 --> 00:45.660
Nice one!

00:45.694 --> 00:47.294
<i>Keep him close to the steer,</i>
<i>Caleb!</i>

00:49.731 --> 00:52.567
Come on, Caleb!

00:52.601 --> 00:54.068
Let's go, boy!

00:56.171 --> 00:58.405
Got it!

00:58.440 --> 01:02.209
<i>That a boy.</i>

01:08.749 --> 01:10.250
Nice work, guys!

01:10.285 --> 01:11.902
I think he's really starting
to get it.

01:11.937 --> 01:13.407
Yeah, he better be.
We've been chasing

01:13.432 --> 01:15.089
this thing in a circle
for like an hour now.

01:15.123 --> 01:17.683
When do you think we can get him back
in a pen with a real steer?

01:17.692 --> 01:20.292
You know, it might do him some
good with a change of scenery.

01:20.295 --> 01:22.496
Are you saying we're
ready for the real deal?

01:22.530 --> 01:25.099
I'm not saying that I'd go
enter a stampede anytime soon,

01:25.133 --> 01:26.967
but maybe a local jackpot?

01:27.151 --> 01:28.418
Yes!

01:28.453 --> 01:31.354
- Hey, Ty.
- Hey, Georgie!

01:31.388 --> 01:32.688
Come by the house
once you're done, okay?

01:32.723 --> 01:35.324
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Um...

01:35.359 --> 01:37.426
Oh shoot!
Uh, I'm late.

01:37.461 --> 01:39.863
Georgie, I can't right now,
okay?

01:39.897 --> 01:41.297
But you promised you'd
help me look for some sanctuaries.

01:41.331 --> 01:43.767
Well, I can help you, Georgie.

01:43.801 --> 01:46.002
Um... actually, I think
it'd be better if Ty did it,

01:46.036 --> 01:49.405
just 'cause he works
at the clinic.

01:49.439 --> 01:51.206
Hey, you know what? I'll talk
to Scott for you, okay?

01:51.241 --> 01:54.109
- Thanks, Ty.
- No problem.

01:54.144 --> 01:55.210
- Peter?
Mm-hmm.

01:55.245 --> 01:59.582
You have to see this.
Look.

01:59.616 --> 02:02.017
<i>The Starbright Academy?</i>

02:02.051 --> 02:03.852
<i>They have a preschool. Marnie's
looking into it for her daughter.</i>

02:03.887 --> 02:05.220
They wear uniforms?

02:05.255 --> 02:06.354
<i>I know! Aren't
they adorable?</i>

02:06.389 --> 02:08.190
<i>Whoa! Is that the price?!</i>

02:08.223 --> 02:09.457
Okay-
Is that-is that the-

02:09.491 --> 02:10.292
Honey, they off-
Is that the tuition?

02:10.326 --> 02:12.795
Yes. They offer
an enriched education.

02:12.829 --> 02:14.629
It's preschool, sweetheart.

02:14.664 --> 02:16.165
What's wrong with the place
down the street from Maggie's?

02:16.199 --> 02:17.766
At the community center?

02:17.801 --> 02:21.169
Honey, that is nothing
but a glorified daycare.

02:21.203 --> 02:24.839
Starbright has an environment that
fosters a thirst for knowledge.

02:24.873 --> 02:26.040
<i>You memorized
their mission statement.</i>

02:26.074 --> 02:27.542
Can we please just go in
for an assessment?

02:27.576 --> 02:30.144
- An assessment? Really?!
- Yes.

02:30.179 --> 02:31.513
They like to meet the parents
and the child

02:31.547 --> 02:34.115
to get an sense of who we are.

02:34.149 --> 02:35.950
It's like a job interview.

02:35.984 --> 02:38.519
Sure.
Sure. Yeah.

02:38.553 --> 02:40.354
I'd love to get a sense of who
the hell they think they are.

02:40.388 --> 02:42.356
Great, I will book
an appointment.

03:04.011 --> 03:06.079
Tim?

03:06.113 --> 03:07.514
Aw!

03:07.549 --> 03:10.250
- Tim Flemming.
- Casey McMurtry?

03:10.284 --> 03:13.353
- Ah!
I-I-I...

03:13.387 --> 03:16.990
Wow! You... you haven't changed
a bit since the rodeo days.

03:17.024 --> 03:18.925
Well, I can't say
the same for you.

03:18.960 --> 03:23.396
- Well, I try to, you know...
- Oh, no, I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.765
It just looks like you
cleaned up your act, that's all.

03:25.799 --> 03:30.102
Oh, yeah. Yeah, well...
I was a mess back then.

03:30.136 --> 03:31.871
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry
to hear about Hank.

03:32.055 --> 03:37.026
Yeah. It's uh... It's crazy to think
it's been over five years now.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.830
Well, I've hard you've done a... A great
job keeping the business running,

03:40.864 --> 03:44.233
just, you know, picking up
where he left off, so...

03:44.267 --> 03:45.734
Thanks. Well, Hank would
never forgive me

03:45.768 --> 03:48.770
if I didn't keep his rodeos
up and running.

03:48.804 --> 03:52.274
Next up is this team roping
jackpot, here in Hudson.

03:52.308 --> 03:54.543
<i>Travis Coleman?
That's a blast from the past.</i>

03:54.577 --> 03:55.977
I know.
That's the point.

03:56.012 --> 03:57.746
<i>We're billing it</i>
<i>as "Legends of Rodeo."</i>

03:57.780 --> 04:02.951
It gives locals a chance to compete
with their champions of yesteryear.

04:02.985 --> 04:04.285
You've won a couple of buckles,
you should come on out.

04:04.319 --> 04:07.989
No.
No, I-I... I'm busy.

04:08.024 --> 04:10.559
I mean, I am trying to get
back into the rodeo,

04:10.593 --> 04:13.261
but I'm just... I'm training
horses. That's what I'm doing.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.164
Well, all the more reason
to come on out.

04:16.197 --> 04:19.733
Show off your stock,
have a little fun.

04:19.767 --> 04:22.270
I tell ya, I'd love to beat
Travis Coleman again.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.205
I don't know, Tim.

04:24.239 --> 04:28.609
He's been doing senior's rodeo, and
you've been out of the game for awhile.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.045
Which means I'm well rested.

04:32.612 --> 04:34.382
Is that what it means?

04:34.616 --> 04:36.116
- It's good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.718
Let me know
if you find a partner.

04:37.752 --> 04:39.887
Yeah, I will.
I'll think about it.

04:43.324 --> 04:46.259
Oh!

05:04.044 --> 05:08.280
♪ And at the break of day
you sank into your dream. ♪

05:10.968 --> 05:16.538
♪ You dreamer  oh, oh, oh...♪
♪ You dreamer,

05:19.009 --> 05:20.542
♪ You dreamer.

05:31.721 --> 05:33.321
Sorry, Scott. We had
a training session.

05:33.356 --> 05:34.923
I just lost track of time.

05:34.957 --> 05:36.992
Tough to ride two horses
with one butt.

05:37.026 --> 05:38.659
Huh?

05:38.694 --> 05:42.364
It's a saying. As in... You're
spreading yourself a bit thin.

05:42.398 --> 05:44.933
Well, we're just uh...
Training a few more horses

05:44.967 --> 05:47.936
and then I can pull back,
let Caleb run with it.

05:47.970 --> 05:51.439
Trust me, it's hard to pull back
on something you own a stake in.

05:53.943 --> 05:55.410
Hey, do you know of any animal
sanctuaries around here?

05:55.444 --> 05:58.045
Something legit?

05:58.079 --> 06:01.716
I made a few calls to this one
place just north of town.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.635
It's run by a guy
named Bob Granger.

06:04.670 --> 06:06.570
Seems to be on the up and up.

06:06.604 --> 06:08.238
Okay, cool.
Thank you.

06:11.442 --> 06:13.177
I got it, Scott.

06:13.211 --> 06:15.546
Hudson Vet Clinic.

06:15.580 --> 06:18.114
<i>Can I ask who's calling?</i>

06:18.149 --> 06:19.749
It's Dr. Kerr on the phone
for you.

06:19.784 --> 06:22.286
Yeah, um...
Yeah, you know what?

06:22.320 --> 06:26.190
I'm gonna take this call
in the other room.

06:26.224 --> 06:28.692
And there you go, Katie.

06:28.726 --> 06:30.960
But I don't
want the yeyyow one.

06:30.995 --> 06:34.363
Honey, it's yel-low,
<i>and this plate is blue.</i>

06:34.398 --> 06:36.532
Can you say blue?

06:36.567 --> 06:41.437
Oh... Both you and Amy had
problems with your y's and l's

06:41.471 --> 06:42.672
when you were little.

06:42.707 --> 06:44.674
Yeah? How about colours?

06:44.708 --> 06:48.811
Well, it was a long time ago, but I do
recall that you could both ride a horse

06:48.845 --> 06:50.913
<i>before you knew it was brown.</i>

06:50.947 --> 06:52.788
Ah, those were the days, huh?

06:52.816 --> 06:54.116
Learning from life on the ranch.

06:54.150 --> 06:56.485
Okay.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.487
None of us went to
an "enriched" preschool

06:58.522 --> 07:00.289
and we all turned out fine,
that's all I'm saying.

07:00.324 --> 07:02.165
Yeah, and we didn't
wear seatbelts either.

07:02.192 --> 07:04.026
Doesn't mean it was right.

07:04.060 --> 07:05.728
<i>You got yourself a deal, Bo.</i>

07:05.762 --> 07:08.396
Yeah, I'll swing by
and pick 'em up tomorrow.

07:08.431 --> 07:12.935
Okay. Pleasure doin' business
with you. Thank you.

07:12.969 --> 07:15.838
Now don't you look like the
cat that just swallowed the canary.

07:15.872 --> 07:19.207
Or the guy that just bought a
couple of champion roping horses.

07:19.242 --> 07:20.908
I don't get it.

07:20.943 --> 07:22.310
Why would you buy horses
that are already trained?

07:22.345 --> 07:23.645
Flip 'em for profit.

07:23.679 --> 07:25.747
How?

07:25.781 --> 07:29.484
I'm gonna enter them in a team roping
jackpot, and I'm gonna ride one of them.

07:29.518 --> 07:31.986
<i>Dad, you haven't
competed in years.</i>

07:32.020 --> 07:36.157
Thank you. Roping, honey,
is like riding a bicycle, okay?

07:36.191 --> 07:38.893
And besides, this is just like
a fantasy camp.

07:38.927 --> 07:43.998
This is locals against "legends" of
the rodeo, so... Which would you be?

07:45.500 --> 07:46.834
That's funny.

07:46.869 --> 07:48.269
You two should pair up!

07:48.303 --> 07:51.138
<i> I don't think so.</i>

07:51.172 --> 07:53.974
Why not? You said
roping was your best event.

07:54.008 --> 07:54.875
<i>Listen, honey,
this is old school,</i>

07:54.909 --> 07:57.010
but it's not that old school.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.045
No, I think I'll be going
with Caleb on this.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.947
Dad, he's way too busy
with his own horses.

08:00.982 --> 08:03.083
Oh, too busy to rope
with a "legend"?

08:06.854 --> 08:08.989
Okay, I'll let Georgie know.

08:09.023 --> 08:11.591
I love you too.
Bye.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.625
Did he find a sanctuary?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.227
Yes, a wildlife reserve.

08:14.262 --> 08:15.395
He's gonna take you there
tomorrow.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.931
Okay, good.

08:17.965 --> 08:21.634
Hey, Georgie, look.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.637
I'm really sorry about how that
whole charity scam went down

08:24.672 --> 08:26.839
and I was just hoping, maybe,
we could put it behind us?

08:26.873 --> 08:29.709
Uh... yeah, sure.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.445
Okay, good.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.514
You know that jackpot that my
dad was talking about at dinner?

08:34.548 --> 08:35.981
Yeah.

08:36.015 --> 08:40.519
I was thinking, you know, what
they're doing for entertainment?

08:40.553 --> 08:44.256
Maybe you could do some trick
riding to fire up the crowd?

08:44.291 --> 08:47.092
Well, I'm only a beginner.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.128
Yeah, but come on!

08:49.162 --> 08:51.897
That tandem ride that you did with
Sandra last year was so cool.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.701
Well, I guess I could call her
and see if she wants to do it again.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.036
Yeah... or you and I could do
it.

08:58.070 --> 09:02.341
Um... yeah. Yeah, sure.
I guess we could try.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.108
Okay. I'll make
some calls then.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.183
Hey! Time to get up!

09:12.218 --> 09:14.652
- <i>Come on, get up!</i>
<i>- What?!</i>

09:14.686 --> 09:17.755
We gotta get
to the rodeo grounds.

09:17.789 --> 09:20.624
Dude, what time is it?

09:20.659 --> 09:22.779
We gotta practice our
team roping, get it in sync.

09:22.794 --> 09:24.963
What're you talking about?

09:24.997 --> 09:27.932
I entered us in the
team roping jackpot.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.901
You know, I thought you
might wanna be my partner.

09:30.935 --> 09:33.838
Thanks, but no thanks.

09:33.872 --> 09:35.272
(Door clicks open forcefully
why?

09:35.306 --> 09:38.776
'Cause if
we lose you'd kill me.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.412
No, I wouldn't.
Plus, we're not gonna lose.

09:41.446 --> 09:44.715
<i>Listen, anybody who's anybody in
rodeo</i> is gonna be at this thing.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.383
Really?

09:46.417 --> 09:50.420
Yeah! It's a big deal.

09:50.454 --> 09:52.756
A couple of my horses
could use the experience.

09:52.790 --> 09:55.792
Well, I got horses. I just
bought a couple of champs.

09:55.826 --> 09:56.426
They're beautiful.
Wait'll you see 'em.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.595
Wow!

09:58.629 --> 10:00.330
I mean, that took
some real stones.

10:00.365 --> 10:02.266
W-w-what do you mean?

10:02.300 --> 10:04.601
Comin' here, askin' me to help
you with your horses?

10:04.635 --> 10:05.635
What?

10:07.271 --> 10:09.639
Okay, fine!

10:09.673 --> 10:11.875
There are lots of guys that
would be lined up to do this.

10:14.211 --> 10:15.478
Right.

10:34.431 --> 10:37.232
- Howdy.
- Hey.

10:37.266 --> 10:38.567
You must be Scott's guy.

10:38.601 --> 10:40.869
- Ty. Ty borden.
- Yeah.

10:40.904 --> 10:42.404
- This is Georgie.
- Hey!

10:44.808 --> 10:47.509
So... you run this place?

10:47.544 --> 10:49.945
Yeah, I know I don't
look like your typical country vet,

10:49.979 --> 10:52.780
but uh... thank God for that,
right?

10:52.815 --> 10:55.417
Come on, I'll show you around my digs.

10:57.286 --> 10:59.754
- Wow, look at 'em all.
- Yeah.

10:59.788 --> 11:01.923
- Huh.
- How many species do you have here?

11:01.958 --> 11:04.826
It fluctuates.
About 20 right now.

11:04.860 --> 11:05.927
- That's incredible.
- Yeah.

11:05.962 --> 11:07.528
Like a zoo.

11:07.563 --> 11:11.165
Nah. It's more
like a wildlife motel.

11:11.199 --> 11:12.700
Some are in and out really quickly,
once I treat their injuries.

11:12.734 --> 11:14.201
Others need a home.

11:14.235 --> 11:15.736
Usually because
they've been abandoned

11:15.771 --> 11:18.238
by people who try
and make them into pets.

11:18.273 --> 11:20.475
Humans really are the stupidest
animals on the planet sometimes.

11:20.509 --> 11:22.777
You're in luck.

11:22.811 --> 11:24.411
Old Gordon here is ready
to check out.

11:26.281 --> 11:27.781
You're gonna
release him right now?

11:27.815 --> 11:29.616
Yeah, I was gonna
do it this morning,

11:29.650 --> 11:31.618
but when Scott called and said you
guys wanted to check this out,

11:31.652 --> 11:33.753
<i>I decided to hold off.</i>

11:33.788 --> 11:38.558
- I thought you might enjoy this.
<i>- Wow.</i>

11:38.593 --> 11:40.060
Here, you can do the honours.

11:40.095 --> 11:41.728
Oh, I... I don't know.

11:41.762 --> 11:43.196
Oh, it's easy.

11:43.230 --> 11:43.997
Just move behind me there,
put your glove on.

11:44.031 --> 11:47.233
Okay.

11:47.267 --> 11:49.235
You just want to put a little bit
of pressure on the back of his legs.

11:49.269 --> 11:53.072
- Like that?
- Yeah.

11:53.107 --> 11:55.274
You ready? Set him free.

12:05.485 --> 12:08.654
<i>That was amazing!</i>

12:10.774 --> 12:12.241
What's in there?

12:12.276 --> 12:13.909
Come here, I'll show you.

12:13.943 --> 12:15.878
Take you to see mama wolf.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.015
Go ahead, take a look.

12:20.049 --> 12:21.316
<i>What do you think of her?</i>

12:21.350 --> 12:24.686
Oh, she's beautiful.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.389
She's nearing the
end of her pregnancy.

12:27.423 --> 12:28.791
She looks so skinny.

12:28.825 --> 12:31.959
Yeah.

12:31.994 --> 12:33.728
You should've seen her
when she got here.

12:33.763 --> 12:35.963
Completely emaciated.

12:35.998 --> 12:37.465
Had to get rid of
an intestinal parasite.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.467
Taenia
or Echinococcosis?

12:39.502 --> 12:40.735
Yeah, taenia.

12:40.770 --> 12:42.103
- Taenia.
- Yeah.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.738
- What's that?
- It's a tapeworm.

12:43.773 --> 12:46.608
Wolves usually contract it
after they eat their prey.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.109
Well, damn, someone's been
hitting the books.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.111
I go to U of C.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.279
I'll try not to hold that
against you.

12:51.313 --> 12:54.182
I was a Western college guy.

12:54.216 --> 12:56.317
- How close is she to giving birth?
- Close.

12:56.351 --> 12:59.353
I've been bunking out here in my
sleeping bag the past few nights, so...

12:59.387 --> 13:00.888
<i>You don't have staff
to cover some shifts?</i>

13:00.923 --> 13:03.324
Dude, I am the staff.

13:03.358 --> 13:05.693
You run this whole place
by yourself?

13:05.727 --> 13:07.093
Well, yeah, it's
tough to keep good people

13:07.128 --> 13:08.662
<i>when you can't pay them.</i>

13:08.697 --> 13:10.817
Hell, I can hardly pay myself.
I'm waiting on a grant.

13:11.599 --> 13:13.066
What if you don't get it?

13:13.100 --> 13:14.368
Well, I'll
figure something out.

13:14.402 --> 13:18.104
Where else would
these animals go, right?

13:18.139 --> 13:20.073
I wanna make a donation.
You take those right?

13:20.107 --> 13:21.674
Hell yeah.

13:21.709 --> 13:24.677
Cheques, cash, food stamps,
whatever you can offer.

13:24.712 --> 13:25.846
Maybe you can throw in this guy
to help me out.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.848
Oh, I already got a job.

13:27.882 --> 13:30.116
I know, but if that grant
comes through, who knows?

13:30.151 --> 13:33.019
You might wanna think about it.

13:33.554 --> 13:35.655
<i>Come on!</i>

13:38.325 --> 13:41.227
Hey, Katie, what colour
do you think this block is?

13:44.097 --> 13:45.224
Hmm...

13:45.549 --> 13:46.655
wed.

13:47.835 --> 13:49.935
Are you sure that
the block is red?

13:51.572 --> 13:53.973
Mama happy?

13:54.007 --> 13:56.641
Yes, honey, Mama's happy.

13:56.676 --> 13:58.837
She just wants her munchkin
to learn her colours, okay?

14:00.847 --> 14:03.182
What about this block?

14:11.657 --> 14:13.358
<i>Well, who's this
good lookin' fella?</i>

14:13.393 --> 14:15.394
This is Brewster.
Sandra lent him to us.

14:15.428 --> 14:17.529
Oh.

14:17.563 --> 14:19.964
<i>But I did
that trick on Chaplin.</i>

14:19.999 --> 14:23.234
Well, she couldn't spare Chaplin right
now, but Brewster's one of her best.

14:23.269 --> 14:26.170
Oh, and I talked to the organizers,
they are happy to have us perform.

14:26.205 --> 14:27.605
Well, isn't that great news?

14:27.639 --> 14:28.639
Yeah, great.

14:31.377 --> 14:35.046
How 'bout I take your bag
and you two can get at it.

14:43.722 --> 14:44.755
Is there an Amy
Fleming at this address?

14:44.790 --> 14:46.557
Yeah, that's me.

14:48.993 --> 14:52.463
I'm sorry,
what am I signing for?

14:53.799 --> 14:57.334
Um... there must be a mistake.

14:57.368 --> 14:59.737
Nope. Says right
there it's for you.

14:59.771 --> 15:00.537
Bought and paid for.

15:00.562 --> 15:02.296
<i>Just need that signature.</i>

15:03.908 --> 15:06.042
It's from the prince, isn't it?

15:11.544 --> 15:15.438
- Did you call Ahmed?  - Yes, of course.
I had no idea that this was coming.

15:15.758 --> 15:17.158
And what did he say?

15:17.292 --> 15:19.427
He said it's for work.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.929
That's a lot of fancy
just to get from A to B.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.464
Grandpa, you know Ahmed, okay?

15:23.499 --> 15:24.499
He wants the best of everything.

15:26.067 --> 15:29.036
Um... let's go get lunch.

15:33.408 --> 15:35.576
Are you gonna keep it?

15:35.611 --> 15:38.411
- I know it's a bit over the top
- You think?

15:38.446 --> 15:39.880
Amy, who gives gifts like this?

15:39.914 --> 15:41.882
It's not a gift.
It's for work.

15:41.916 --> 15:43.951
Right.

15:43.985 --> 15:48.188
I must have mentioned that it was
difficult sharing Grandpa's truck.

15:48.222 --> 15:52.092
Amy, this is more than a work
truck and you know it.

16:05.957 --> 16:07.524
<i>You have one new message.
To listen to your-</i>

16:08.842 --> 16:11.044
<i>Hi, Dr. Cardinal,
it's Teresa from Dr. Kerr's clinic.</i>

16:11.078 --> 16:12.379
<i>Received all of your</i>
<i>financial reports</i>

16:12.413 --> 16:14.947
for the past five years,
thank-you.

16:15.232 --> 16:16.833
<i>Wanted to make sure you got</i>
<i>all of our clinic's financials</i>

16:16.867 --> 16:18.802
<i>and client list as well.</i>

16:18.836 --> 16:20.870
<i>I sent over everything</i>
<i>you requested yesterday.</i>

16:20.905 --> 16:22.071
<i>Call or email us back</i>
<i>to confirm.</i>

16:22.105 --> 16:25.007
<i>Thanks.</i>

16:31.081 --> 16:33.049
Hey, Georgie, I'm sorry we got
interrupted out there.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.317
Do you wanna get back at it?

16:34.351 --> 16:37.019
I've got a book report
I gotta go finish.

16:37.054 --> 16:39.221
Okay.
Maybe after then?

16:39.256 --> 16:40.423
Actually, I don't think
it's such a good idea.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.057
It's only a couple of days away.

16:42.091 --> 16:43.659
You already know the trick-

16:43.693 --> 16:47.262
Look, I don't wanna do it, Amy!
I changed my mind, okay?

16:52.401 --> 16:55.504
Everything all
right between you two?

16:57.474 --> 16:59.007
Georgie, what's going on?

16:59.041 --> 17:00.475
Nothing.
It's nothing.

17:00.509 --> 17:02.543
Yeah, sounds like
something to me.

17:02.578 --> 17:05.380
Look, I don't wanna talk
about it, Jack.

17:05.414 --> 17:07.048
There's nothing you can do
about it this time.

17:10.185 --> 17:13.054
How's Old Farley doing?

17:13.089 --> 17:17.959
Well, still not a fan of getting his
nails trimmed, but we got through it.

17:17.992 --> 17:18.925
Hey, Scott, there's a message
on the machine there for you,

17:18.961 --> 17:21.228
from Dr. Kerr's office.

17:21.262 --> 17:24.898
Something about exchanging
financial reports?

17:24.933 --> 17:28.202
I guess you're wondering
why we'd be doing that.

17:28.236 --> 17:30.538
It's none of my business.

17:30.572 --> 17:32.692
Well, it's just with rising
costs and fewer clients...

17:35.377 --> 17:38.778
It kinda makes sense
to partner up.

17:38.813 --> 17:42.816
Oh, you're merging the clinics?
This is already done?

17:42.850 --> 17:45.852
We're still working out
the details.

17:45.887 --> 17:49.656
<i>I didn't want to say anything</i>
<i>until it's official.</i>

17:49.690 --> 17:53.493
I'm not gonna lose my job, am I?

17:53.528 --> 17:58.765
Come on, Ty, I'm gonna do everything I
can to keep you and Cassandra on board.

18:03.037 --> 18:04.337
Okay, what is your problem?

18:04.371 --> 18:05.804
Is it still about the money?

18:05.839 --> 18:09.875
No, it's not-yeah, sure, a little
bit, but... It's also about Katie.

18:09.910 --> 18:11.044
You saw her in there.
She didn't make a peep.

18:11.078 --> 18:12.778
That's not like her.

18:12.812 --> 18:13.346
You didn't like it in there
did you, sweetie?

18:13.380 --> 18:15.681
Of course she did.

18:15.715 --> 18:19.018
Wasn't that counting tree
cool? Yeah.

18:19.053 --> 18:22.421
Look, it is a new environment,
and she'll warm up to it.

18:22.455 --> 18:24.256
I think Starbright is
a really good fit for her.

18:24.290 --> 18:26.191
Because Marnie said so?

18:26.225 --> 18:27.860
Because it'll give her
a chance to catch up.

18:27.894 --> 18:29.628
Catch up?!

18:29.663 --> 18:32.397
Before she gets into
kindergarten. Right, honey?

18:32.432 --> 18:34.633
Don't you want to play
at Starbright?

18:34.668 --> 18:37.436
There is a lot of other cool
places you can play too, right?

18:37.470 --> 18:39.538
And I just think we should
check them all out, that's all.

18:39.572 --> 18:41.106
Okay, well, you heard
what Ms. Wadsworth said.

18:41.140 --> 18:45.210
There aren't many spots left and we
could miss our chance to get in there.

18:45.244 --> 18:49.181
All I'm saying is, I'm
not totally sold yet, okay?

18:49.215 --> 18:51.216
Mama happy?

18:51.250 --> 18:54.686
No, honey,
Mama's not happy.

18:58.590 --> 19:01.959
Wow!

19:01.993 --> 19:03.461
I knocked the bumper off mine.

19:03.495 --> 19:05.930
<i>But it was worth it!</i>

19:05.965 --> 19:07.632
This is special. You know how
many options this thing has?

19:07.666 --> 19:09.000
Yeah, I'm beginning
to get the idea.

19:09.284 --> 19:10.551
Whose is this?

19:10.585 --> 19:14.087
I'm using it for work.

19:14.121 --> 19:17.591
What, your work? Your work?
Is this yours?

19:17.625 --> 19:20.327
Uh, well, not really.
It's Ahmed's.

19:20.362 --> 19:21.928
I'm just using it to get around.

19:21.963 --> 19:23.897
You know, work with his horses.

19:23.931 --> 19:26.032
Oh, you really put
a spell on him!

19:26.067 --> 19:30.770
- Dad, it's just for work, it's not--
- I'm not implying anything else, Amy.

19:30.804 --> 19:33.773
I'm just saying
you are very good at your work

19:33.807 --> 19:38.178
and it's good to see someone who
appreciates it in such a big way.

19:38.212 --> 19:40.981
Yeah.

19:41.015 --> 19:44.550
So did you get a chance to talk
to Caleb about the jackpot?

19:44.585 --> 19:48.621
- Oh, I'm not sure we're gonna be the
right fit, so....  -  He turned you down?

19:50.557 --> 19:52.277
Oh, I'm just thinking
of some other options.

19:52.292 --> 19:56.095
Oh, so... everybody else turned
you down too, huh?

19:56.129 --> 19:57.764
Yeah.

19:57.798 --> 19:59.999
You know this is a team
roping event, right?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.033
I know.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.804
I... have one last option.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.710
Jack! Hey!

20:11.744 --> 20:12.611
Beautiful day, isn't it?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.513
It was.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.848
What? What's the matter?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.584
I don't know.
What are you up to?

20:19.619 --> 20:21.887
Oh, I'm up to nothing.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.188
I mean, I just had a fantastic
day at the rodeo grounds,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.725
and I'm all excited
about this jackpot thing.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.593
Do you remember
what that was like?

20:28.628 --> 20:30.295
You remember?

20:30.329 --> 20:32.431
Being in the chute, knowing
what your horse is gonna do

20:32.465 --> 20:35.266
before your horse does it?

20:35.301 --> 20:38.669
Feel of the burn...
On your hand from the rope,

20:38.703 --> 20:42.740
the steer's right in front
of ya and... wham!

20:42.774 --> 20:46.077
Suddenly everything's
just in slow-motion.

20:46.111 --> 20:49.447
We used to call that
"the zone."

20:49.481 --> 20:50.781
That's where everything falls
into place and I miss that so much.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.851
Don't you miss that?

20:53.885 --> 20:55.206
You can't find a partner,
can you?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.725
I just really wanna
beat Travis Coleman,

21:01.760 --> 21:03.928
and I thought it would be nice
if you did it with me.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.129
Oh, well, I think I'm
a little too "old school"

21:06.164 --> 21:08.131
to help you out much.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.033
I'm not gonna beg.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.034
If you don't wanna do it,
you don't wanna do it.

21:11.069 --> 21:12.135
I don't wanna do it.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.237
<i>Let me finish.</i>

21:14.272 --> 21:15.772
Because once you find out who
Travis Coleman's partner is,

21:15.806 --> 21:18.741
you might change your mind.

21:18.776 --> 21:21.144
You know what, Tim?
I don't hold grudges

21:21.179 --> 21:23.546
against my old rodeo rivals
like you do.

21:23.581 --> 21:26.415
I really couldn't care less
who it is.

21:30.019 --> 21:31.688
Dan Hartfield.

21:36.226 --> 21:37.694
Dan Hartfield.

21:41.631 --> 21:44.100
So... how is this gonna work?

21:44.134 --> 21:47.136
Is this new vet just gonna move
into the clinic with you and Scott?

21:47.170 --> 21:49.638
I don't know. This just
came out of left field.

21:49.672 --> 21:51.340
Scott didn't even tell me
it was in the works.

21:51.375 --> 21:54.410
Doesn't seem like him.

21:54.444 --> 21:57.112
My day went kinda sideways
as well.

21:57.146 --> 21:58.380
New client horse?

21:59.975 --> 22:02.551
New truck, actually.

22:02.886 --> 22:06.688
Ahmed had it delivered...
for work.

22:06.723 --> 22:09.591
I was shocked too, but...
It kinda makes sense.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.262
No, it doesn't.
Not really.

22:14.296 --> 22:15.596
I knew you'd say that.

22:15.631 --> 22:17.432
That's why I didn't drive it
over here.

22:17.466 --> 22:21.436
- No, that's not what I meant, Amy, I--
- No. You know... I do good work for him

22:21.470 --> 22:22.950
and this is like a--
It's like a bonus.

22:22.971 --> 22:25.606
It's not like he has
some ulterior motive.

22:25.641 --> 22:28.843
- Whoa. I didn't say that he did.
- But that's exactly what you were thinking.

22:28.877 --> 22:30.444
Where-
where are you going?

22:30.478 --> 22:31.779
I hate when we get like this,
okay?!

22:31.813 --> 22:33.180
<i>When we both get our backs up</i>

22:33.214 --> 22:35.516
and then one of us is gonna say
<i>something we regret.</i>

22:35.551 --> 22:36.551
That's not true.
What are you talking about?

22:36.585 --> 22:37.919
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

22:37.953 --> 22:39.787
When we've both had a chance
to just cool off.

22:50.665 --> 22:54.268
I just signed for this.
It's from Ahmed.

22:55.836 --> 22:56.996
Set of keys to a new Porsche?

22:57.004 --> 22:59.106
Hah.

23:01.642 --> 23:05.378
A first class ticket
on a flight to Antwerp.

23:05.412 --> 23:06.880
Where's that?

23:06.914 --> 23:09.783
In Belgium.

23:09.817 --> 23:13.419
"I need my good luck charm
back"?

23:17.191 --> 23:18.958
- Hey!
- Hey!

23:18.992 --> 23:20.693
Is everything all right?

23:20.727 --> 23:23.028
Yeah. Uh, do you want
some breakfast?

23:23.063 --> 23:25.598
Uh, no, I'm good. I uh...
Gotta go with Georgie. You ready?

23:25.632 --> 23:27.833
Oh yeah.

23:27.867 --> 23:28.601
Thanks though,
I'll see you later.

23:28.635 --> 23:30.203
- Have fun!
- Thanks!

23:30.237 --> 23:31.904
Okay, here we go.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.785
<i>Amy, we need to talk about this.</i>

23:41.810 --> 23:43.277
"His good luck charm"?

23:43.562 --> 23:44.395
Like you're some kind
of possession.

23:44.429 --> 23:46.064
Just leave me alone, Lou!

23:46.098 --> 23:48.633
Amy, you can't ignore
this anymore, okay?

23:48.667 --> 23:51.569
He obviously has feelings for you,
and you know what you need to do.

23:51.603 --> 23:53.270
I'm not going, okay?

23:53.305 --> 23:55.272
Of course you're not going!

23:55.307 --> 23:57.441
But you have to cut off ties
with him altogether.

23:57.476 --> 23:59.477
He is my biggest client, Lou.

23:59.511 --> 24:01.445
I have to ask this
one last time.

24:01.480 --> 24:06.083
Is there any chance, even a small
chance, that you have feelings for him?

24:06.117 --> 24:08.151
- No!
- Okay. But don't bite my head off

24:08.185 --> 24:10.253
because you're obviously
holding onto something.

24:10.287 --> 24:13.957
Yes! I am holding onto my job,
here, at Hillhurst.

24:13.992 --> 24:15.959
It's incredible working with
his high performance horses.

24:15.994 --> 24:18.996
Okay, but this isn't
about horses, Amy.

24:19.030 --> 24:20.731
Not anymore.

24:24.568 --> 24:25.801
Here's my
donation, Mr. Granger.

24:25.836 --> 24:28.104
<i>Oh, please, call me Bob.</i>

24:28.139 --> 24:29.839
Heck, this is the first
donation I've had in a while.

24:29.873 --> 24:32.475
Call me anything you like.

24:32.510 --> 24:33.976
Check out those buffalo.

24:34.011 --> 24:36.078
Yeah. The calves
are all doing well.

24:37.981 --> 24:39.181
So how's the wolf?
Can I go see her?

24:39.215 --> 24:40.616
Yeah, go for it.

24:40.651 --> 24:42.018
Stay on the outside
of her pen, okay?

24:42.052 --> 24:42.818
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey, take that for me?

24:42.853 --> 24:43.853
Oh, 'kay.

24:43.854 --> 24:45.587
Pound it.
Pfffft!

24:48.224 --> 24:50.159
She seems like
a great kid, man.

24:50.193 --> 24:51.593
Yeah, she is.

24:54.064 --> 24:56.398
Oh, hey, I'm
getting that grant.

24:56.432 --> 24:58.900
- Well that's great.
- Yeah.

24:58.934 --> 25:01.002
Got a few friends at school that'd
kill to work in a place like this.

25:01.037 --> 25:05.307
I dunno. I like you, Ty.
You impress me.

25:05.341 --> 25:07.209
Why? 'Cause I know a few things
about tapeworms in wolves?

25:07.243 --> 25:09.778
No, not just that.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.746
I dunno, I get a good vibe.

25:11.781 --> 25:15.483
This isn't an easy place to work and
my gut tells me you could handle it.

25:15.517 --> 25:16.818
Yeah, well,
you know I already have a job.

25:16.852 --> 25:22.691
Yeah, well, with this grant, I
can match what Scott pays, so...

25:22.725 --> 25:24.292
Yeah, well, my schedule's
pretty insane right now.

25:24.326 --> 25:26.828
I got this horse starting
business thing going too, so...

25:26.862 --> 25:30.698
See, man, I... ugh!
I love that, you know?

25:30.732 --> 25:32.866
You've got ambition.

25:32.901 --> 25:35.203
And that's the whole reason
I opened this place.

25:35.237 --> 25:38.172
Sure, yeah, I bust my butt 24/7
to keep it afloat,

25:38.207 --> 25:41.909
but at least
it's my own deal, you know?

25:41.943 --> 25:43.844
Um... I'm not judging, but uh...

25:46.948 --> 25:52.086
I couldn't handle working my way
up the line in some stuffy clinic.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.880
Just imagine what
you could learn here, 'kay?

26:08.902 --> 26:12.038
Hup, hup, hup!

26:17.778 --> 26:20.246
What was that?

26:20.280 --> 26:22.160
Well, you took him
to the corner too quick.

26:22.182 --> 26:24.683
Well, Jack, it's a
timed event, you know?

26:24.718 --> 26:25.952
You're gonna have to take him
in the corner

26:25.986 --> 26:29.055
if we wanna have a chance
of winning.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.157
<i>Going that
well, huh, fellas?</i>

26:31.191 --> 26:33.126
Oh yeah, we're just
shaking off the rust.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.893
We'll be fine.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.862
Well, I'm just
glad you found a partner.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.930
- Yeah.
- And another legend at that.

26:38.965 --> 26:39.998
<i>You're Jack bartlett,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

26:40.032 --> 26:42.067
Yeah, that's right.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.103
I'm Casey McMurtry,
I'll be running this thing.

26:45.138 --> 26:48.574
Nice to meet you.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.442
Well, I hope you can iron
everything out before the jackpot.

26:50.477 --> 26:52.377
Oh, yeah, we will.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.512
We will.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.048
You bring the buckles,
we'll bring the glory.

27:01.670 --> 27:04.139
We'll bring the glory?

27:04.173 --> 27:07.208
It's a saying. What? Did it-what,
did it sound kind of stupid?

27:07.243 --> 27:09.777
No, it sounded
a whole lot stupid.

27:09.811 --> 27:12.880
- Ya.
- Okay.

27:12.915 --> 27:16.350
So, now I know why you're so
gung ho to win this thing, anyway.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.452
Oh, what're you
starting on, Jack?

27:18.486 --> 27:24.358
- I'm not starting anything.
- Yeah?

27:24.392 --> 27:29.029
Women are not impressed with
your so-called rodeo prowess.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.597
Funny, I seem to remember
Marion very impressed

27:30.631 --> 27:32.099
when I beat you in Ponoka.

27:32.133 --> 27:34.334
Oh, that's not the way
I remember it.

27:34.369 --> 27:37.504
Matter of fact, she thought you
were pretty full of yourself.

27:37.539 --> 27:41.307
Oh. I think I was, but
she still went out with me.

27:41.341 --> 27:43.543
Well, yeah,
because of your horse.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.912
Pegasus?

27:45.947 --> 27:50.050
Yeah, she saw you giving him a
nice brush down after that rodeo.

27:50.084 --> 27:53.186
Well, that was our
routine, you know,

27:53.220 --> 27:56.522
and it showed him
that he'd done a good job.

27:56.557 --> 28:00.093
I guess she figured a guy who cared
about his horse couldn't be all bad.

28:02.829 --> 28:04.063
I don't think I can remember
the last time I competed

28:04.098 --> 28:06.399
without Marion watching me.

28:06.433 --> 28:10.403
Oh, I suspect she will be.

28:10.437 --> 28:11.837
Come on, you and me teaming up
for the first time?

28:11.871 --> 28:15.107
No way she'd miss that.

28:15.141 --> 28:18.310
Yeah, she might help us
find that zone too.

28:22.015 --> 28:25.150
Okay, I'll get it.

28:25.184 --> 28:27.953
Don't run to the phone
or anything.

28:27.988 --> 28:29.955
Hello?

28:29.990 --> 28:32.624
Oh, hi.

28:32.658 --> 28:34.959
Let me just check.

28:34.994 --> 28:36.728
- It's him.
-  I'm not here.

28:36.762 --> 28:40.499
- Amy!
- I'm not here.

28:40.533 --> 28:43.301
I'm afraid she's not here.
May I take a message?

28:43.336 --> 28:45.637
Okay. Goodbye.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.608
It's him.

28:50.643 --> 28:52.610
You cannot keep avoiding him.

28:52.645 --> 28:54.846
I just don't know
what to say yet.

28:57.016 --> 28:57.782
I'm sure you'll
think of something.

28:57.816 --> 29:01.218
Lou!
 Hello.

29:01.253 --> 29:04.288
Yes, she is.
Just one moment.

29:04.322 --> 29:05.689
It's for you.

29:05.723 --> 29:07.758
Hello?

29:07.792 --> 29:11.629
Hi, Ms. Wadsworth.
How are you?

29:11.663 --> 29:13.230
Thank you for calling me back.

29:13.265 --> 29:16.534
I was hoping I could talk
to you about enrolling Katie.

29:16.568 --> 29:18.435
No, no.

29:18.470 --> 29:20.137
Unfortunately, my husband
won't be able to make it,

29:20.171 --> 29:22.438
so it's...
It's just me this time.

29:37.388 --> 29:40.223
Wow! He really
went all out, huh?

29:40.847 --> 29:42.147
Ty...

29:42.857 --> 29:45.462
Just saying,
it's pretty sweet.

29:46.797 --> 29:50.132
Why don't you just tell me
what you really feel?

29:50.167 --> 29:52.602
All right.

29:52.636 --> 29:55.137
It's pretty weird some guy
bought my fiancee a new truck.

29:55.172 --> 29:57.940
I know.

29:57.974 --> 30:00.710
Doing business with a prince
can take some getting used to...

30:00.744 --> 30:04.646
Like today, for example.

30:04.681 --> 30:07.416
What happened?

30:07.700 --> 30:09.780
He wants me to go back on tour
with him and his team.

30:11.804 --> 30:13.237
I'm not gonna go.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.809
How did he take that?

30:17.844 --> 30:19.811
I haven't told him yet.

30:19.846 --> 30:22.080
Why not?

30:22.114 --> 30:26.451
I just wanna make sure it doesn't
affect the work I do with him here.

30:26.485 --> 30:30.021
- I get that.
- Stop doing that.

30:30.055 --> 30:31.856
Doing what?

30:31.890 --> 30:34.225
I know you don't
want me to work for him.

30:34.259 --> 30:36.694
Again, Amy, I never said that.

30:36.728 --> 30:38.329
So quit trying to guess
what I'm thinking

30:38.330 --> 30:41.265
and just figure out
what it is that you want.

30:46.588 --> 30:49.056
Welcome, folks,
to Hudson's very first

30:49.090 --> 30:52.493
"Legends of the Rodeo"
team roping jackpot.

30:52.527 --> 30:54.762
<i>What a glorious day for this</i>
<i>very special competition</i>

30:54.796 --> 30:56.764
<i>that gives locals...</i>

30:56.798 --> 30:58.399
<i>Don't tell me you're riding
one of your horses out there?</i>

30:58.433 --> 31:01.201
His name is
Carter, and yes I am.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.077
Really? Who'd you
partner up with on that?

31:03.104 --> 31:05.605
I'm not competing.
I'm the flagger.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.141
Oh yeah?

31:09.510 --> 31:13.346
Well, it's good to see they
got somebody of your caliber.

31:13.381 --> 31:16.383
Hey, listen, watch out for illegal
cross fire from Travis Coleman.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.685
That guy's always trying
to get away with something.

31:18.719 --> 31:21.360
Well, don't you fret, I'm a
bit of a stickler for the rules.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.424
That's good.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.831
I don't know, Jack.

31:32.865 --> 31:35.033
<i>That rope looks a little soft</i>
<i>for heeling.</i>

31:35.067 --> 31:38.603
Since when did you become
an expert on roping?

31:38.637 --> 31:41.006
Well, you pick
up a few tricks of the trade

31:41.040 --> 31:43.474
when you train with a star
like Travis Coleman.

31:43.509 --> 31:45.576
Yeah.

31:45.611 --> 31:49.114
So this must be quite the thrill
for a weekend cowboy like you.

31:49.148 --> 31:54.652
Weekend cowboy... I've
been roping every day for a month

31:54.687 --> 31:57.087
to get ready for this thing.

31:57.122 --> 31:59.390
How about you?

31:59.425 --> 32:01.492
Can't say I've
had as much idle time

32:01.527 --> 32:04.962
what with marrying
that beautiful wife of mine.

32:07.899 --> 32:10.735
Yeah, well,

32:10.769 --> 32:13.804
I wonder what Lisa's gonna think
when get your butt whipped...

32:14.339 --> 32:15.872
<i>By a weekend cowboy?</i>

32:18.075 --> 32:19.876
Keep it up, Jack.

32:28.052 --> 32:30.153
How'd your meeting
with Dr. Kerr go?

32:30.187 --> 32:32.922
Still working things out.

32:32.957 --> 32:35.591
You know, I took Georgie to that
wildlife reserve you suggested.

32:35.625 --> 32:37.493
Yeah, Bob's quite
the character, isn't he?

32:37.527 --> 32:41.197
Yeah.
He shoots from the hip.

32:41.232 --> 32:42.698
Can you believe
he offered me a job?

32:42.733 --> 32:45.601
Oh?

32:45.635 --> 32:48.003
Yeah. I gotta say, it'd be
a pretty unique opportunity.

32:48.037 --> 32:51.640
I told you, Ty,
I'm gonna fight for you here.

32:51.675 --> 32:55.411
What does that mean, Scott?

32:55.445 --> 32:58.447
Dr. Kerr, he wants to keep his
staff. I want you guys.

33:00.316 --> 33:02.450
<i>But we can't have both.</i>

33:02.485 --> 33:04.987
Okay, well,
what if he doesn't budge?

33:05.021 --> 33:07.890
This is my business, Ty.
I have to make it work.

33:09.926 --> 33:12.160
With or without me?

33:12.195 --> 33:14.596
Just give me some time
to work on him.

33:14.630 --> 33:17.799
I can't, Scott.
Bob needs an answer.

33:21.036 --> 33:23.371
You're really gonna do this?

33:23.406 --> 33:25.239
You left me no choice.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.334
<i>Next up,
we have local businessman and rancher</i>

33:33.359 --> 33:34.825
<i>Dan Hartfield!</i>

33:36.863 --> 33:39.297
<i>Dan's teaming up with two time</i>
<i>all 'round Canadian champion,</i>

33:39.331 --> 33:41.066
<i>Travis Coleman.</i>

33:45.438 --> 33:47.805
<i>Now, I want you to watch
Coleman's technique right here.</i>

33:48.140 --> 33:50.475
<i>You're gonna see how he gets</i>
<i>that loop already in position</i>

33:50.509 --> 33:55.180
<i>for that good quick swing.</i>

33:56.698 --> 33:58.466
<i>Here we go.</i>

33:58.500 --> 34:00.701
<i>One, two, three, unload.</i>

34:02.805 --> 34:05.072
<i>And there's a wild throw</i>
<i>from Hartfield,</i>

34:05.106 --> 34:08.507
<i>but somehow he gets both feet.</i>

34:08.543 --> 34:10.377
<i>Let's check that time.</i>

34:10.411 --> 34:12.612
<i>Hey! Five point six</i>
<i>on the clock.</i>

34:15.016 --> 34:17.150
<i>And our flagger says</i>
<i>it was a clean run,</i>

34:17.185 --> 34:19.485
<i>so that's the time to beat.</i>

34:19.520 --> 34:24.023
Dan:

34:24.058 --> 34:27.060
He's got a horseshoe
planted so far up his-

34:27.094 --> 34:29.128
<i>No, you know what?
Don't worry about it.</i>

34:29.163 --> 34:32.398
Just stay focused.

34:32.433 --> 34:34.967
I'm glad to see somebody wants
to win this as much as I do.

34:35.002 --> 34:36.869
There's no way we're losing
to Dan Hartfield.

34:41.408 --> 34:44.210
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:44.244 --> 34:45.777
What're you doing home?

34:45.812 --> 34:49.114
I had a meeting in Hudson, so I
figured I'd just swing by for lunch.

34:49.149 --> 34:53.686
Oh. I was just--
At the Starbright Academy, right?

34:53.719 --> 34:55.420
I know.
Georgie told me.

34:55.455 --> 34:56.922
Peter, I can explain.

34:56.956 --> 34:59.124
You don't need to
explain anything, sweetheart.

34:59.158 --> 35:00.425
You're hell bent on
getting her into that place,

35:00.460 --> 35:02.094
it doesn't matter what I think.

35:02.128 --> 35:03.996
That's not true, okay?

35:04.030 --> 35:06.532
Marnie's daughter
got in there yesterday,

35:06.566 --> 35:07.967
and I was afraid
they were gonna to fill up.

35:08.001 --> 35:09.868
So you just went and
enrolled her anyway, right?

35:09.902 --> 35:11.870
No. Well, I was going to...

35:14.507 --> 35:18.510
- But what, they were already full?
- No.

35:18.544 --> 35:21.013
Ms. Wadsworth doesn't think
that Katie's ready.

35:40.132 --> 35:44.902
I just got your text.
Did you actually quit?

35:44.936 --> 35:48.805
Well, Scott couldn't
guarantee I'd stay on, so...

35:48.840 --> 35:51.942
What is going on over there?
This is crazy.

35:51.976 --> 35:54.645
He's just looking out
for his best interests.

35:54.679 --> 35:57.281
I decided to do the same.

35:57.315 --> 35:59.282
I took that job at the reserve.

36:05.188 --> 36:07.291
Are you okay?

36:07.625 --> 36:10.393
I can look on the
bright side of things.

36:10.428 --> 36:11.789
Be exciting to start
something new.

36:14.165 --> 36:15.965
Probably pretty scary too, huh?

36:25.943 --> 36:27.743
And now,
here's a special treat.

36:27.778 --> 36:31.914
We have legend teamed up
with legend

36:31.949 --> 36:35.117
<i>with a couple of cowboys who
are keeping it in the family.</i>

36:35.151 --> 36:38.420
<i>Jack Bartlett still holds</i>
<i>the saddle bronc riding record</i>

36:38.455 --> 36:40.690
set on these very grounds,

36:40.724 --> 36:43.960
<i>And you might remember that</i>
<i>magical run Tim Fleming had:</i>

36:43.994 --> 36:46.028
<i>Four straight all 'round titles.</i>

36:49.765 --> 36:50.999
Yeah!

36:52.135 --> 36:53.635
- Yah!
Hi-yah!

37:09.652 --> 37:12.720
<i>And that's how it's done!</i>

37:12.754 --> 37:15.856
Five seconds flat!
That's gonna win it!

37:22.430 --> 37:23.597
What?

37:23.632 --> 37:25.198
Oh, come on!
What for?

37:25.233 --> 37:27.200
It's just the rules, Tim.

37:27.235 --> 37:31.638
Oh no, the flagger says
that was an illegal head catch.

37:31.672 --> 37:33.507
<i>That's when that small circle</i>
<i>on the header's rope,</i>

37:33.541 --> 37:34.874
<i>The hondo,</i>

37:34.908 --> 37:37.877
<i>passes over one horn</i>
<i>and loops the other.</i>

37:37.911 --> 37:41.714
<i>Sorry, guys,</i>
<i>but that's disqualification.</i>

37:41.749 --> 37:45.852
<i>Travis Coleman and Dan Hartfield
are your winners.</i>

37:45.886 --> 37:47.553
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Travis.

37:57.096 --> 37:58.797
Can we talk?

38:00.318 --> 38:01.990
I'm doing homework.

38:04.537 --> 38:06.437
Georgie, this is
kind of important.

38:08.775 --> 38:11.543
What is going on between us?

38:11.577 --> 38:12.911
Nothing.

38:12.945 --> 38:15.847
There's definitely something.

38:15.882 --> 38:18.015
I wanted to be like you.

38:18.050 --> 38:20.051
And I was never okay with that.

38:20.085 --> 38:21.352
You should be your own person.

38:21.387 --> 38:25.089
I am, and I'm glad.

38:25.123 --> 38:27.058
I wouldn't wanna be
such a big fat fake anyways.

38:27.092 --> 38:29.661
Where is this coming from?

38:29.695 --> 38:30.961
How could you do this to Ty?

38:30.996 --> 38:32.564
What're you talking about?

38:32.598 --> 38:35.365
I saw the video, Amy.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.235
I saw you and Ahmed.
I saw you kissing Ahmed!

38:46.951 --> 38:48.151
Can you believe Caleb?

38:48.276 --> 38:50.811
An illegal headcatch?
Come on, are you serious?

38:50.845 --> 38:52.046
Now don't get all
worked up about it.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.780
We actually did
pretty darn good out there.

38:54.315 --> 38:56.817
Marion would be impressed.

38:56.851 --> 38:58.084
That we almost won?

38:58.118 --> 39:00.587
That we didn't kill each other.

39:00.621 --> 39:05.024
Hey, guys, look.
They gave me a new buckle.

39:05.059 --> 39:08.061
How's it look?

39:08.095 --> 39:10.330
Like you're overcompensating
for something.

39:10.364 --> 39:13.299
Oh, Jack, is that sour grapes?

39:13.334 --> 39:15.368
You won on a technicality, Dan.

39:15.402 --> 39:17.937
We had the better run
and you know it.

39:17.971 --> 39:20.873
Well, thanks to these
high end horses.

39:20.907 --> 39:23.676
He's right, Jack.

39:23.710 --> 39:25.010
If you had have been riding
these high end horses

39:25.044 --> 39:26.211
you would have cleaned
our clocks.

39:26.245 --> 39:27.913
Illegal headcatch or not.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.381
No, no, no, no.
I know what you're doing.

39:29.415 --> 39:33.452
You're not gonna con me into buying
any more of your overpriced stock.

39:33.487 --> 39:34.752
I'm just saying if a couple
of broke down cowboys like us

39:34.787 --> 39:38.790
could do that well, imagine how well you
would do on the senior rodeo circuit.

39:38.824 --> 39:40.993
You wanna come by tomorrow,
take them for a test drive?

39:41.027 --> 39:42.361
I'm done.

39:45.264 --> 39:49.234
I've got a lunch
date tomorrow with Casey.

39:49.268 --> 39:51.503
Maybe I'll drop by after that.

40:02.214 --> 40:04.516
You know, that video
isn't what it looks like.

40:04.550 --> 40:07.518
Then why does he keep sending
you stuff?

40:13.625 --> 40:16.060
I love Ty, and I
don't wanna lose him.

40:18.330 --> 40:19.497
What if he finds the video?

40:19.531 --> 40:22.366
- Georgie...   - Well, I'm not gonna show
him, but he could easily find it,

40:22.401 --> 40:24.134
just like I did.

40:36.447 --> 40:39.049
Ahmed, we need to talk.

40:43.320 --> 40:46.889
Tough luck out there.

40:46.924 --> 40:50.460
Yeah, well, I'm sure Dan'll
be bragging about it tomorrow...

40:50.494 --> 40:51.761
On your date.

40:51.795 --> 40:54.830
On our date?

40:54.865 --> 40:58.400
Women love a winner.

40:58.435 --> 41:00.335
What do you think I am,
some kind of buckle bunny?

41:00.370 --> 41:05.841
- No, I...   - We're having lunch to
discuss a sponsorship, that's it.

41:05.876 --> 41:10.212
I'm sorry. I...
That's not what I meant.

41:10.246 --> 41:13.182
I know you're not just gonna
give some guy attention

41:13.216 --> 41:14.783
'cause he won a roping contest.

41:14.817 --> 41:17.219
I... I know that.

41:17.253 --> 41:23.459
That's not why entered. I mean...
How pathetic would that be?

41:23.493 --> 41:26.061
You know, if I went and bought
a couple of top notch horses

41:26.096 --> 41:31.967
and dusted my saddle off after 20 years,
and then begged my ex-father-in-law

41:32.001 --> 41:36.337
to be my team roping partner just
to get the attention of some woman?

41:36.371 --> 41:37.939
That'd be pretty pathetic.

41:38.474 --> 41:39.608
Yeah.

41:42.678 --> 41:45.413
But also kind of flattering.

41:47.933 --> 41:51.236
You know, you could've just
asked me out for a coffee.

41:53.572 --> 41:57.108
Well, how are you with a brush?

41:57.142 --> 41:59.310
I got two of these guys,
I can't do 'em both.

42:04.115 --> 42:06.016
I'm not working
for Ahmed anymore.

42:06.050 --> 42:10.020
So come on, let's take it for a
spin before I have to ship it back.

I don't know, it's gonna be
tough to send this truck back.

42:49.660 --> 42:53.329
What about you? Any
regrets about leaving Scott?

42:53.363 --> 42:56.632
Oh... well, it all
feels a bit surreal.

42:56.666 --> 42:58.534
And this reserve, do
you think it's worth it?

42:58.568 --> 43:00.803
Well, I hope so.

43:00.837 --> 43:03.372
I hope I'm not doing it
out of spite, you know?

43:03.407 --> 43:06.775
Why, because Scott
couldn't promise you anything?

43:06.810 --> 43:09.210
No, because he tried
to hide it from me.

43:09.245 --> 43:12.948
Where's the trust, you know?
Where's the loyalty?

43:12.982 --> 43:17.752
You lose those things and
what do you got left, right?

43:17.786 --> 43:18.820
Come on,
