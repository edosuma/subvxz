00:27.900 --> 00:32.561
Boy, that is absolutely it with me and
the Long lsland Expressway.

00:32.779 --> 00:35.864
I should have my head examined.
I never learn.

00:36.075 --> 00:40.866
Hypothetically, it's 1 2 minutes faster,
but that's with no traffic.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.867
When was there no traffic
on the L. I. E.?

00:44.082 --> 00:50.285
- Do you listen to the traffic reports?
- I listen, but they are not current.

00:50.505 --> 00:56.839
And I have to learn the lesson over
and over again. I sucker myself in.

00:57.052 --> 01:02.213
I try and save the minutes,
and then I wind up trapped.

01:02.433 --> 01:07.640
- I'm sitting, like it's a parking lot.
- Well, you're here now.

01:07.854 --> 01:13.608
I'm here, but I'm late and I'm
aggravated. I get so aggravated.

01:21.075 --> 01:22.355
DONNA:
What's the matter?

01:22.702 --> 01:24.030
Gregory?

01:26.622 --> 01:29.077
You okay, Greg? You all right?

01:29.291 --> 01:33.241
MEDAVOY: I can't catch my breath.
KELLY: Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.213
MEDAVOY: I can't get a breath.
KELLY: You want water?

01:36.423 --> 01:38.498
- How about water?
SlPOWlCZ: What's wrong?

01:38.717 --> 01:40.674
FANCY: He can't breathe.
MARTINEZ: Want EMS?

01:40.885 --> 01:44.883
- Like someone's on your chest.
- Forget EMS. Get that chair.

01:45.097 --> 01:48.846
- We'll go to the hospital.
FANCY: This is Lt. Fancy.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.847
A detective's having
shortness of breath.

01:52.062 --> 01:53.972
- This feels weird.
- Sit down.

01:54.190 --> 01:58.104
- Why walk when you can ride?
- We'll take you downstairs.

01:58.318 --> 01:59.777
Let's go.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.406
KELLY: You okay?
MEDAVOY: Yeah, well, I can't breathe.

02:03.615 --> 02:06.652
KELLY: Get a chair downstairs.
MEDAVOY: How embarrassing.

02:06.868 --> 02:08.196
MARTINEZ:
You're like the sultan of lndia.

02:08.369 --> 02:10.526
MEDAVOY:
Don't call my wife.

02:10.747 --> 02:14.614
KELLY: Take it easy, Greg.
- I'll take a few hours personal time.

02:14.834 --> 02:18.617
- Put in a 28 when you get back.
- Thanks.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.311
A Sudden Fish

03:34.284 --> 03:37.036
He's being evaluated.
You got that complaint?

03:37.203 --> 03:39.872
Here. If they didn't admit him,
that's good, right?

03:40.039 --> 03:41.617
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeah.

03:42.416 --> 03:44.990
Ernie Dowd, I'm Detective Sipowicz.

03:45.211 --> 03:51.130
- That's a nice set of steps outside.
- The city hasn't put up a ramp yet.

03:51.341 --> 03:54.591
How about we get out of the way
over here?

03:54.804 --> 03:58.219
Two men entered your apartment
and robbed you?

03:58.432 --> 04:04.019
About 3 a. m. They snatched my good
wheelchair, my cash, some other stuff.

04:04.229 --> 04:06.636
They forced entry into your place?

04:06.856 --> 04:13.108
They were waiting when I got off the
elevator and jumped me from behind.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.524
That wheelchair was electric,
cost over $3000.

04:16.699 --> 04:19.533
Took me four years to get it
how I wanted.

04:19.743 --> 04:23.443
Where'd you been before you returned
to your apartment?

04:23.664 --> 04:27.531
- A bar on Seventh and B.
SlPOWlCZ: Gallagher's?

04:27.750 --> 04:33.290
- Yeah, across from the veterans center.
- You go there all the time?

04:33.506 --> 04:36.210
- All the time.
- Did you see these guys?

04:36.885 --> 04:41.178
No, I couldn't see them.
They put a bag over my head.

04:41.389 --> 04:46.513
They tore my place up,
tore up the floorboards...

04:46.894 --> 04:51.805
...shoved a sock in my mouth,
tipped me over in a corner.

04:52.023 --> 04:57.859
Said if I gave them any trouble, they'd
punt me. You know, like a football.

04:58.321 --> 05:01.571
They find anything when they
tore up your floor?

05:01.783 --> 05:06.326
Yeah, one of my guns,
a. 45 from Vietnam.

05:07.247 --> 05:10.200
- It was valuable.
SERGEANT: ADA Costas, a message.

05:10.374 --> 05:16.744
These are the serial numbers of
the frame and motor on my wheelchair.

05:16.964 --> 05:22.171
- Can you call the VA, verify a theft?
- Yeah.

05:22.385 --> 05:23.714
SlPOWlCZ:
Listen...

05:24.304 --> 05:27.720
...anybody know your place?
Where you kept the gun?

05:27.933 --> 05:30.174
- Nobody who'd do this.
- You sure?

05:30.393 --> 05:32.599
I just said so.

05:34.188 --> 05:39.526
I'll check that bar and run m. o. 's,
robberies with the same pattern.

05:39.736 --> 05:42.273
People who take off gimps?

05:42.571 --> 05:46.439
I'll be in touch.
Can you make it out okay?

05:46.658 --> 05:49.695
I made it in, I'll make it out.

05:56.752 --> 05:59.242
COSTAS:
Okay. Great, thanks.

06:00.254 --> 06:04.086
SlPOWlCZ: How's it going?
- Want to go over that Ortiz testimony?

06:04.300 --> 06:06.756
No, I got that pretty well in mind.

06:06.969 --> 06:12.675
<i>That's not why I came here, although
you are the sine qua non of my case.</i>

06:12.892 --> 06:16.806
Well, then, what forsooth
would you be here for?

06:17.020 --> 06:18.930
I got you something.

06:21.608 --> 06:24.230
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

06:25.737 --> 06:30.114
- It's for your aquarium.
- Yeah, it's a clown fish.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.026
What's the matter?

06:33.745 --> 06:36.745
I wouldn't be comfortable taking that.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.704
You mind telling me why?

06:39.917 --> 06:43.962
You don't introduce a sudden fish
to an ecology like that.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.872
It's a saltwater fish.
The pet- shop guy said it's fine.

06:48.091 --> 06:51.709
Then he knows my tank better
than I do, yeah.

06:52.970 --> 06:54.964
What's wrong, Andy?

06:55.765 --> 07:00.676
I don't want my environment thrown
out of whack, some sudden new fish.

07:00.895 --> 07:04.845
You don't want me bringing presents.
It makes you nervous.

07:05.065 --> 07:06.939
SlPOWlCZ:
Maybe that's right.

07:07.109 --> 07:12.483
Do you wanna pretend we're not dating
or we don't know each other?

07:12.656 --> 07:15.407
Can you get your money back
for the fish?

07:15.618 --> 07:16.992
Sure.

07:17.202 --> 07:21.663
I'll tell him the guy I got
it for turned out to be an asshole.

07:22.916 --> 07:24.030
KELLY: Morning.

07:24.376 --> 07:25.574
COSTAS: Excuse me.

07:27.503 --> 07:28.832
SlPOWlCZ:
Hey.

07:29.047 --> 07:32.913
- How you feeling, Medavoy?
- It was an anxiety attack.

07:33.134 --> 07:35.968
It was just stress, you know.

07:36.179 --> 07:38.136
I have to take it easier...

07:38.347 --> 07:41.052
...not let things bother me.

07:41.266 --> 07:43.223
We can cancel that wreath?

07:44.770 --> 07:49.811
Boy, that was something, huh?
I mean, I couldn't catch my breath.

07:50.024 --> 07:54.567
- Thanks for riding me there, John.
- No problem. Take it easy, okay?

07:54.779 --> 07:58.278
MEDAVOY: Yeah, thanks.
- Listen, Jimmy Wexler called you.

07:58.491 --> 08:01.409
Yeah, I'm gonna do a security
job for him.

08:01.786 --> 08:04.111
- You told me he's sick.
- He is.

08:04.330 --> 08:07.746
- I'm bodyguarding his girlfriend.
- All that dough.

08:14.923 --> 08:19.668
Donna, do you think you
could make it your business...

08:19.886 --> 08:23.220
...to make sure there's
decaffeinated coffee?

08:23.431 --> 08:28.592
- Don't you think you should go home?
- I really think I'm okay.

08:28.811 --> 08:34.433
You said you were just going to pick
up your coat and then go home.

08:35.693 --> 08:38.480
And if you do not do
what you promised...

08:38.695 --> 08:42.479
- ...I am going to start screaming here.
MEDAVOY: Okay. Okay.

08:42.698 --> 08:45.024
Donna was at the emergency room.

08:45.243 --> 08:48.078
- Is that right?
- I guess they're skating.

08:48.288 --> 08:51.123
MEDAVOY: I'll finish my coffee and go.
- Yeah.

08:52.542 --> 08:55.542
- How you feeling, Greg?
- Okay, lieutenant.

08:55.753 --> 08:59.336
- It was only an anxiety attack.
- Good.

09:01.092 --> 09:03.962
Although, if it's okay with you...

09:04.178 --> 09:07.676
...I thought I might
take a vacation day, head home.

09:07.890 --> 09:12.385
- Sure. Stay off the L. I. E.
- Absolutely. That's a vow.

09:20.944 --> 09:23.102
ROBIN: Hey, Johnny.
KELLY: Hey, Robin.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.945
- Come in.
- How's Jimmy?

09:25.156 --> 09:28.322
We'll know more
from some tests they took.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.194
- Okay.
- I'll get my bag.

09:30.411 --> 09:32.154
All right. Okay.

09:33.581 --> 09:34.991
KELLY:
Hey, boss.

09:35.666 --> 09:38.157
- Hey, John.
- Hey.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.914
- You interrupted a negotiation.
- Yeah?

09:41.129 --> 09:46.752
They just took some kind of blood
test, see how far this thing spread.

09:47.426 --> 09:51.590
If that test came back,
I'm looking at 1 8 months, pain- free.

09:51.805 --> 09:53.430
- You know my only question?
- Hm?

09:53.641 --> 09:55.514
- Where do I sign?
- Mm.

09:55.684 --> 10:00.227
I've been sitting here, offering the
deal to whoever's in charge.

10:00.439 --> 10:03.143
- Well, I hope you get good news.
- Yeah.

10:03.359 --> 10:06.608
I want to take
her out a few more times.

10:06.820 --> 10:10.235
- Where's she going?
- Bowling with her girlfriends.

10:10.449 --> 10:15.194
I gotta tell you, she's been
here for me, hasn't backed up a step.

10:15.411 --> 10:20.452
I told her it's no good being cooped
up like this. I drive her nuts.

10:20.666 --> 10:23.074
I get where I can't stand the pain.

10:23.294 --> 10:27.077
Then the dope they give me,
it puts me in left field.

10:27.298 --> 10:28.672
Yeah.

10:30.425 --> 10:33.296
I told her she's gotta go out.

10:34.304 --> 10:36.213
- Hey, Robin.
ROBIN: Be right there.

10:36.431 --> 10:40.298
If I can't watch over her,
I want someone I trust doing it.

10:40.519 --> 10:42.760
- You got it.
ROBIN: What?

10:44.480 --> 10:46.687
WEXLER:
Hey, you. Take off.

10:46.899 --> 10:49.983
Why do I need a bodyguard?
You're the millionaire.

10:50.195 --> 10:55.402
- Anyone goes for her purse, belt him.
- What if I leave my zirconium at home?

10:55.616 --> 10:58.901
You could have had as many jewels
as any broad.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.571
I know. All right, well,
I'll be home early.

11:04.666 --> 11:06.908
- You take it easy.
- Enjoy.

11:08.294 --> 11:09.872
See you later.

11:18.304 --> 11:20.296
EDIE:
Come on, Robin!

11:23.893 --> 11:25.885
- Yes!
- Yes!

11:28.480 --> 11:29.856
You were right.

11:30.065 --> 11:33.232
- Follow- through.
- You should coach bowling.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.064
Teach me that follow- through thing.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.735
Edie, your stroke is fine.
I wouldn't want to screw it up.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.187
EDIE:
Mm.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.283
- She likes you.
- Yeah?

11:42.493 --> 11:44.700
As if you couldn't tell.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.789
- I'll be right back.
- I'll go with you.

11:48.999 --> 11:53.661
If you follow me to the ladies' room,
I'm going to yell for a cop.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.539
Okay.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.543
Detective, like this?

12:02.805 --> 12:05.046
- Watch me.
- I'm watching you.

12:13.064 --> 12:14.179
[CHEERING ]

12:16.317 --> 12:18.725
A few more boards to the right.

12:18.944 --> 12:21.399
- I'll be right back.
EDIE: Okay.

12:57.981 --> 13:00.104
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:00.316 --> 13:03.934
- Why so glum? You got so quiet--
- Jimmy around?

13:04.154 --> 13:06.442
Where else would he be?

13:11.786 --> 13:14.074
- Hey.
- Hey, Johnny.

13:15.790 --> 13:17.368
How you feeling?

13:17.583 --> 13:21.034
I can still bend steel
with my bare hands.

13:21.253 --> 13:23.957
- I'm waiting for the results.
- Yeah.

13:24.173 --> 13:25.964
What are you doing here?

13:26.758 --> 13:29.083
I got a problem at work.

13:29.303 --> 13:32.338
They're swamped.
They want me to come back.

13:33.473 --> 13:36.842
These guys, private bodyguards,
they're all good.

13:37.018 --> 13:39.094
I can vouch for them.
They're all ex- cops.

13:39.270 --> 13:43.350
- No. You ain't going anywhere.
- These guys are good.

13:43.566 --> 13:48.441
I asked you to watch her. Should I
make some calls? I'll call the mayor.

13:48.612 --> 13:50.901
- Jimmy, I--
- I contributed big to him.

13:51.114 --> 13:55.362
- I can't watch her right now.
- You got a problem, it'll go away.

13:55.577 --> 13:57.784
Let me make some calls.

13:58.496 --> 14:00.573
Wait a minute. Wait.

14:01.290 --> 14:06.629
Wait a minute. Let me work this out,
okay? I can work this out.

14:07.631 --> 14:11.330
- You work it out?
- Yeah, let me figure it out.

14:11.967 --> 14:13.758
Okay.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.588
So earn your money.

14:16.305 --> 14:18.547
What happened last night?

14:19.224 --> 14:20.802
Went bowling.

14:21.017 --> 14:24.387
- That's it?
- Yeah, she bowled a 1 1 6.

14:24.729 --> 14:28.229
- What happened afterwards?
- Came home.

14:28.692 --> 14:32.854
- Didn't go anywhere?
- Girlfriends did. I brought her home.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.646
- She went home?
- Yeah.

14:36.449 --> 14:41.276
You know something? I used to ask her
to marry me about once a week.

14:41.495 --> 14:47.533
She'd say,"Why would I want to marry
you? You give me enough crap now."

14:47.752 --> 14:53.338
She didn't want anybody to think
that she was doing it for the money.

14:53.549 --> 14:58.923
I respect that. We're having a great
time together the way things are...

14:59.137 --> 15:02.340
...so why not just leave things alone?

15:02.557 --> 15:06.305
- That's her attitude. That's her.
- Yeah.

15:06.519 --> 15:11.893
Well, listen, you know, I set up a
bank account for her, $ 1 00, 000.

15:12.107 --> 15:16.852
Four years, Johnny,
has not taken a penny.

15:17.070 --> 15:20.274
She wouldn't take
the diamond earrings either.

15:20.490 --> 15:25.117
Believe me, I'd be
satisfied with 1 8 good months.

15:25.328 --> 15:28.613
I could take her out to dinner
a few more times.

15:28.832 --> 15:30.290
ROBIN:
Here you go.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.958
KELLY: I'm gonna shove off.
- Yeah?

15:32.168 --> 15:33.543
KELLY:
Yeah.

15:33.711 --> 15:36.546
- You got plans for later?
ROBIN: No.

15:36.756 --> 15:40.456
No, but if you want Edie's number--
Edie likes John.

15:40.676 --> 15:43.084
- Is Edie the one with the big tits?
ROBIN: Jimmy.

15:43.387 --> 15:45.545
Yeah. You mind walking me out?

15:45.764 --> 15:47.638
We can coordinate the week.

15:47.849 --> 15:49.509
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good.

15:51.937 --> 15:55.851
- Take care of yourself. Feel better.
- All right, Johnny.

15:56.149 --> 15:57.809
We'll talk later.

16:02.155 --> 16:03.696
We need to talk.

16:05.157 --> 16:08.905
If we're going to do this,
we better make some rules.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.286
Your own time is your business,
but with me...

16:12.498 --> 16:15.996
- ...show Jimmy respect.
- What are you talking about?

16:16.210 --> 16:19.578
You at the bowling alley
with this other guy.

16:19.796 --> 16:22.796
I never want to lie to him again.
Understand?

16:23.008 --> 16:27.669
- It's not what you think.
- Don't do it around me again.

16:29.096 --> 16:30.507
- Fine.
- Okay?

16:30.724 --> 16:32.466
Yeah, fine.

16:37.688 --> 16:39.727
He is blackmailing me.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.355
- The guy at the bowling alley?
- Yeah.

16:44.903 --> 16:51.237
Yeah, Johnny. His name is Stan
Heywood. We grew up together.

16:51.534 --> 16:54.784
We even dated a
little bit in high school.

16:55.038 --> 16:57.789
A couple of months ago,
I ran into him.

16:57.999 --> 17:03.241
We started having coffee and talking
on the phone once in a while.

17:03.462 --> 17:09.714
It was good to talk to someone,
someone I had something in common with.

17:10.010 --> 17:14.718
You know, Jimmy,
he's been sick for so long...

17:18.769 --> 17:23.347
- ...and I slept with him one time.
- Tell me about the blackmailing.

17:25.023 --> 17:29.816
Last week, he told me he was
in trouble with a bookmaker.

17:30.029 --> 17:35.818
This bookmaker knew about us, and if
he didn't pay, Jimmy would know too.

17:35.993 --> 17:39.611
- You know he's lying, right?
- I don't know what I know.

17:39.789 --> 17:43.453
I don't know how I could have
gotten myself into this.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.115
- It'll kill Jimmy.
- How much does he want?

17:46.294 --> 17:47.919
$25, 000.

17:48.088 --> 17:52.086
- Jimmy opened a bank account for you.
- But I never used it.

17:52.258 --> 17:56.801
Withdraw a cashier's check
for $ 1 5, 000 and get it to me.

17:56.971 --> 17:59.592
- Wait, he said 25, 000.
- Don't worry.

17:59.807 --> 18:02.298
He's asking for more than he owes.

18:02.476 --> 18:04.220
Get the $ 1 5, 000 check...

18:04.436 --> 18:09.145
...put it in an envelope,
and put me together with this scumbag.

18:27.834 --> 18:32.412
SlPOWlCZ: You know a guy by the name
of Ernie Dowd? A crippled guy.

18:32.588 --> 18:33.703
Yeah.

18:33.881 --> 18:37.830
- When did he leave the other night?
- Maybe 2 in the morning.

18:38.010 --> 18:42.303
- Did he leave with anyone?
- That's really not my business.

18:42.472 --> 18:45.223
This guy got robbed.
Somebody set him up.

18:45.391 --> 18:48.096
I wanna know who
he keeps company with.

18:48.269 --> 18:51.353
- Why don't you ask him?
- Because I'm asking you.

18:55.151 --> 18:59.729
You serve drunks here. That's illegal.
You want a summons for that?

18:59.905 --> 19:05.741
You want the state liquor people here
checking your liqueurs for tiny bugs?

19:20.550 --> 19:24.214
SlPOWlCZ: I wanna talk to you, Chicky.
- Who are you? What about?

19:24.387 --> 19:28.800
- Come on, just get in the car.
- Oh, man.

19:41.986 --> 19:44.857
Do you know Ernie Dowd?

19:45.031 --> 19:47.902
It's a crime
to date disabled veterans?

19:48.076 --> 19:51.575
You don't date. You're for sale.
You got a record.

19:51.787 --> 19:54.622
Those guys wouldn't
be getting any at all.

19:54.791 --> 19:57.578
This isn't a conversation
about hooking.

19:57.752 --> 20:02.994
Dealing with gimps ain't easy.
You can't get the plumbing to work--

20:03.173 --> 20:06.507
Shut up! Just shut up!

20:06.885 --> 20:10.752
We are talking about you telling
some thieving pricks...

20:10.930 --> 20:13.847
...about what's in a guy's apartment.

20:14.059 --> 20:17.178
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You do.

20:17.395 --> 20:20.479
You told these guys Ernie Dowd
had some stuff...

20:20.647 --> 20:23.353
...hidden in his
apartment's floorboards.

20:23.525 --> 20:26.230
- This is great.
- You want to try Alaska?

20:26.403 --> 20:29.523
You wanna bang Eskimos
for whale sandwiches?

20:29.740 --> 20:34.900
Because I will put you on ice.
Now, you tell me who you talked to!

20:35.912 --> 20:40.159
I'll give you their names,
but this didn't come from me.

20:44.921 --> 20:50.341
- How you feeling today, detective?
- Much better, Donna. Thanks.

20:50.509 --> 20:52.336
Listen...

20:52.512 --> 20:57.469
...I didn't thank you
how I should have yesterday.

20:57.641 --> 21:00.808
Going through all that with me
at the hospital.

21:00.978 --> 21:02.436
It's okay.

21:02.646 --> 21:06.228
What'd your wife say
when you told her what happened?

21:07.025 --> 21:09.515
Not too much, you know.

21:09.903 --> 21:12.820
Did you talk with her
about taking walks?

21:13.030 --> 21:16.446
Yeah, we may do that.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.537
You didn't tell her.

21:20.705 --> 21:25.283
I didn't want to worry her.
Besides, it turned out to be nothing.

21:25.459 --> 21:28.080
What happened yesterday
wasn't nothing.

21:28.254 --> 21:31.504
The doctor said I should take
the treadmill test...

21:31.715 --> 21:34.632
...but he doesn't think
there's a problem.

21:35.427 --> 21:40.551
What the doctor said was, you're under
extreme stress, you need to relax...

21:40.724 --> 21:44.139
...and he suggests
taking long walks after work.

21:44.352 --> 21:47.519
Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm okay.

21:48.272 --> 21:49.600
I'm fine.

21:50.274 --> 21:51.934

- Thanks.

22:02.536 --> 22:07.612
My boss is leaving town. He wants to
hear your prep on the Ortiz testimony.

22:07.832 --> 22:09.955
- He'll come here if necessary.
- Yeah, all right.

22:10.126 --> 22:11.240
Tomorrow at 2:00?

22:11.419 --> 22:13.376
Tomorrow at 2.

22:15.047 --> 22:17.882
Is Stan Heywood there?
Stan, John Kelly.

22:18.051 --> 22:21.170
I'm Robin's friend.
I got something for you.

I'll see you there in a while. Good.

22:29.477 --> 22:32.644
- What's up?
- I'm going to roust a couple guys.

22:32.814 --> 22:36.313
Well, let me cancel this.
I'll go with you.

22:36.485 --> 22:39.402
- I'll take Martinez.
- Andy, it's no problem.

22:39.571 --> 22:41.942
Don't worry, I'll take him.

22:42.114 --> 22:44.866

that Vietnam vet?

22:45.033 --> 22:47.607
He's crippled.
They left him lying there.

22:47.786 --> 22:51.072
- Let me go with you.
- No, I'll take the kid.

22:51.248 --> 22:53.952
Okay. You gonna be all right?

Sit down, Stan.

23:25.197 --> 23:27.688
Why did you pick this place to meet?

23:27.866 --> 23:31.614
Well, I wanted a place
you'd be familiar with.

23:32.954 --> 23:36.572

23:36.916 --> 23:39.870
- Thank you.
WAITRESS: You're welcome.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.339
You don't know how
I've been waiting for this.

23:46.550 --> 23:51.259
Listen, you see Robin before I do,
tell her I really appreciate it.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.763
- Are you listening to me, Stan?
- Yeah.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.384
Because you need
to be very clear about something.

23:58.561 --> 23:59.972
Go ahead.

24:00.146 --> 24:04.938
This is not the beginning of anything.
This is the end.

24:05.151 --> 24:10.026
Got no argument here. Look, I don't
know what Robin told you about this...

24:10.197 --> 24:15.108
...but I made a couple mistakes,
reference to some gambling.

24:15.286 --> 24:18.203
Believe me, I learned my lesson.

24:18.372 --> 24:21.124

gambles no more.

Robin helping me out like this.

- Oh, God.
- The only reason I don't bust you--

24:40.476 --> 24:44.555
- I made a couple mistakes--
- I understand. Things happen.

24:44.730 --> 24:49.439
I won't pop you, because I haven't
looked inside that envelope.

24:49.651 --> 24:52.985
If I were to find money in there,
I'd pop you.

You've committed a crime.

I will put you in jail.

23 ounces of crack cocaine.

was standing in his toilet bowl.

He found out.

32:08.898 --> 32:15.067
- I got your message.
WEXLER: You got my message? Get in.

What's the matter?

32:18.324 --> 32:20.732
I know about the 1 5 grand.

32:20.951 --> 32:24.865
Did you think they weren't going
to call me about that?

32:25.038 --> 32:30.245
My accountant called me.
The bank called him right away.

32:30.502 --> 32:34.630
What do you know about this guy,
Stan-- ? Whatever his name is.

32:34.798 --> 32:38.166
Why are you putting John
in the middle of this?

32:38.343 --> 32:42.043
- It has nothing to do with him.
- Shut up. I'm asking him.

32:42.263 --> 32:46.261
I gave him the envelope,
because she didn't wanna see him.

32:46.434 --> 32:49.351
WEXLER: Ever seen him before?
- This guy is a bug.

32:49.561 --> 32:51.886
He's not the type you'd remember.

32:52.064 --> 32:56.940
You people must think
I'm too sick to notice 1 5 grand.

I still know what's going on
around here.

- A couple of months!

That's what I got!

33:19.131 --> 33:21.456
And then, John...

...I get called about this check.

33:24.803 --> 33:28.468
Do you understand now
about the check, Jimmy?

33:28.932 --> 33:32.098
She gave it to him for what?
High school dues?

33:32.268 --> 33:35.055
Because he owed money to a bookmaker.

33:35.271 --> 33:37.394
WEXLER:
So suddenly, she gave it to him...

33:37.565 --> 33:41.692

the high school yearbook together.

33:43.863 --> 33:48.904

Johnny...

34:02.046 --> 34:03.837
...was she sleeping with him?

34:04.006 --> 34:07.707
If I'd have seen something like that,
I would tell you.

34:07.927 --> 34:12.588
You think that maybe he was just
an old friend? That's all there was?

34:12.764 --> 34:17.474
We didn't talk. He didn't seem
impressive. I handed him an envelope.

34:17.643 --> 34:19.766
- He wasn't?
- No. He's gone...

34:19.938 --> 34:22.891
...and he knows not to come back.

It's gonna be okay about this guy,
so forget about it.

- No, you didn't.

He's gonna die now...

35:02.978 --> 35:07.687
- ...and he thinks I don't love him.
- Listen to me, he knows you love him.

35:07.858 --> 35:10.016
And all he wanted...

35:10.194 --> 35:14.772
...was a little more time,
where it didn't hurt so bad.

- What's the point?
