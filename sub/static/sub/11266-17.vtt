WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:04.546
Previously on 90210...
We probably shouldn't talk
to each other at all.

00:04.588 --> 00:05.881
Annie would hate it.
Emily,

00:05.923 --> 00:07.842
that-that is just not true.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.343
I did not mean to hurt anybody.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.303
EMILY:
I'm really sorry, Annie.
(cries)

00:11.345 --> 00:12.805
You made her cry?

00:12.847 --> 00:14.515
She is faking it.
This is what she does!

00:14.556 --> 00:15.599
That looked real to me.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.643
What the hell is wrong
with you?!

00:17.685 --> 00:18.769
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?!

00:18.811 --> 00:19.770
EMILY:
What are you talking about?

00:19.812 --> 00:22.272
(Emily screams)
SILVER: Oh, my God!

00:22.314 --> 00:24.441
EMILY:
I just couldn't bear
to go home and face Annie.

00:24.483 --> 00:27.361
I was hoping
I could spend the night.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.529
LAUREL:
What are you doing?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.280
Just... smoking pot.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.616
Call me what you want,
but you're not smoking anymore.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.368
NAOMI:
I can't stop thinking
about you.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.369
You'd better not say anything
about this to anyone.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.247
I'm sorry, Naomi.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.708
You're just not my type.
ADRIANNA: You can help me

00:40.749 --> 00:42.334
find the cheating whore

00:42.376 --> 00:43.627
who has ruined my life.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.629
Wait, stop. Oh, my God!

00:50.592 --> 00:52.051
Here's Ernest!

00:55.430 --> 00:56.849
My own love!
(sighs)

00:56.891 --> 00:58.684
A moment, Ernest.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.227
May I ask you:

01:00.268 --> 01:02.521
Are you engaged to be married
to this young lady?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.647
To what young lady?
Good heavens! Gwendolen!

01:04.690 --> 01:05.816
Yes, to "good heavens,
Gwendolen"!

01:05.858 --> 01:07.985
I mean... to Gwendolen.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.361
(audience laughs)
(titters)

01:09.403 --> 01:11.196
Of course not!

01:11.238 --> 01:13.782
What could have put such an idea
into your pretty little head?

01:13.824 --> 01:14.825
(sighs)
Oh, thank you.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.702
You may...
Oh, I felt there was

01:16.744 --> 01:19.038
some slight error,
Miss Cardew.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.539
The gentleman
you are now embracing

01:20.581 --> 01:23.625
is my cousin,
Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.502
EMILY:
Algernon Moncrieff!
Mm-hmm.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.630
Are you called "Algernon"?

01:28.672 --> 01:31.675
(audience laughter)

01:31.717 --> 01:34.053
A gross deception has been
practiced on both of us.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.679
My poor wounded Cecily!

01:35.721 --> 01:38.599
My sweet wronged Gwendolen!

01:38.640 --> 01:41.100
♪ ♪
(laughter, applause)

01:47.441 --> 01:50.527
(zealous applause)

01:50.569 --> 01:53.906
(cheers)
Oh!

01:53.948 --> 01:54.990
Whoo!
Whoo!

01:55.032 --> 01:56.909
(applause and cheering)

02:08.502 --> 02:11.090
NAOMI:
Hello?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.841
(gasps)

02:12.883 --> 02:15.886
I guess we could have bought her
a bigger bouquet.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.137
I'll fix that.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.892
What are you doing?

02:21.934 --> 02:24.061
No.
Voilà!
You can't

02:24.103 --> 02:25.562
do that.
Too late.
Already done.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.855
(giggles)

02:26.897 --> 02:27.940
Can you believe
that cheap bastard?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.858
Uh, well, n...
(ringtone chimes)

02:29.900 --> 02:31.777
Um... hey, will you hold...

02:31.819 --> 02:32.611
will you hold this for a second?
Yeah.
Thanks.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.529
Sure.
(sighs)

02:44.081 --> 02:45.833
Funny text?

02:45.874 --> 02:47.626
Yeah, no, it was, um...
it's nothing.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.585
Who's it from?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.087
My sister.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.589
Actually, can I borrow
your phone for a second?

02:52.631 --> 02:54.091
Yeah. What do you need?

02:54.133 --> 02:56.175
My mom called earlier,

02:56.217 --> 02:58.553
and I wanted to text her back,
but my battery died.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.681
Oh, damn.
Mine-mine just died, too.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.181
Hmm. Weird.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.018
That's pretty weird.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.602
Hey!

03:05.644 --> 03:06.854
Hey!

03:06.895 --> 03:09.023
(all cheering)
Bravo!

03:09.064 --> 03:10.607
Congratulations.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.026
Real good.
These are for you.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.736
Oh...
They're so beautiful!

03:14.778 --> 03:16.155
Congratulations.
Mm.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.698
Silver thought
they'd be too much,

03:17.739 --> 03:19.033
but I told her
you'd love them.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.701
Wha....

03:20.742 --> 03:21.994
Emily...

03:22.036 --> 03:23.037
you were so good.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.621
ADRIANNA:
Amazing.
Seriously,

03:24.663 --> 03:25.873
I wasn't even bored,
and I hate old plays

03:25.914 --> 03:27.415
where people talk funny.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.501
You know, I just love
going out there every night;

03:29.543 --> 03:30.836
it's such a rush!

03:30.878 --> 03:32.046
You know, I know it's not
Broadway or anything,

03:32.087 --> 03:33.047
but it's a great stepping stone.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.007
(clears throat,
knock on door)

03:35.049 --> 03:37.258
Great show tonight, Emily.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.803
You too, Maggie. Great work.
Good job.
Good job.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.849
(sighs) I swear,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.934
if that girl steps on my line
one more time...

03:45.976 --> 03:47.644
I mean, did you see her

03:47.686 --> 03:48.812
miss her cue in the second act?

03:48.854 --> 03:50.147
It's like every night,

03:50.189 --> 03:52.607
something.
So unprofessional!

03:52.649 --> 03:54.902
So, do you guys
want to go out tonight?

03:54.943 --> 03:55.944
Or do you have other plans?

03:55.986 --> 03:57.738
We're all yours.
Totally.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.781
Awesome. I'll just
wash off my face

03:59.823 --> 04:03.618
and change into something
a little less 19th-century,

04:03.660 --> 04:06.538
and we'll hit the town!
(girls giggle)

04:06.580 --> 04:07.748
I can't get over the flowers;

04:07.789 --> 04:08.999
you guys must have
spent a fortune.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.876
Hmm, not as much as you think.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.843
So, you want to come over to my
house after school and study?

04:19.885 --> 04:22.303
You mean you'd turn on the music
and dance around

04:22.345 --> 04:23.805
while I do my homework
and then you copy it?

04:23.847 --> 04:26.767
Yes... and cookies.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.143
SILVER: (sighs)
It always seems like

04:28.185 --> 04:30.145
such a bad deal until
you bring up the cookies.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.193
Hey, guys.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.444
Annie.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.780
Hi.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.658
So, how are you doing?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.077
I'm fine.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.954
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.749
Not... really.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.833
I'm embarrassed.

04:51.875 --> 04:52.960
Humiliated,

04:53.001 --> 04:54.962
actually, and I'm sure

04:55.003 --> 04:56.671
everybody thinks
I'm a total psychopath.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.715
Not everybody.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.592
We don't.
Really?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.010
You had a bad day.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.637
You almost put Emily

05:03.678 --> 05:04.888
through the vending machine.
But you didn't.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.308
So, how was
your three-day "vacation"?

05:08.349 --> 05:11.145
Oh, you know... amazing.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.729
Yeah, Mother has never
been so proud.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.856
We just shopped and partied.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.900
No, she was really pissed off.

05:16.942 --> 05:17.818
But I don't blame her.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.319
I totally lost it.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.072
I let envy and jealousy
get the best of me,

05:22.114 --> 05:24.199
but... I learned my lesson.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.951
And I really just want to put it
behind me and move on.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.953
Have you talked to Emily?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.288
No. We've pretty much

05:29.329 --> 05:30.914
avoided each other
since it happened.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.292
(sighs) Hey,

05:33.333 --> 05:34.293
I don't know
if you'd be into this,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.544
but Emily's birthday
is coming up soon.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.172
Maybe you want to... help us
plan something for her.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.215
Yeah, that could
be a good idea.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.340
Help you guys
bury the hatchet.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.885
Put the whole ugly episode
behind you.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.012
Yeah. You know what?

05:46.138 --> 05:47.139
That is a good idea.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.723
That would be really nice.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.892
Ah, good to have you back!

05:50.934 --> 05:51.935
Ah, good to be back.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.813
SILVER:
(sighs) Uh, just, you know,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.858
promise you won't kick my ass
if I ever piss you off.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.776
(giggles) You didn't think
I had it in me, did you?

05:59.818 --> 06:01.862
No, I didn't...
Actually...

06:01.903 --> 06:04.990
Okay, and... time.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.701
So, who wants to read
their sonnet out loud?

06:10.162 --> 06:12.706
Well, don't all raise your hands
at once, guys.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.666
(giggling)

06:14.708 --> 06:16.210
Ivy, maybe you could

06:16.251 --> 06:17.752
share what you wrote?

06:20.672 --> 06:21.840
Um...

06:21.882 --> 06:24.134
Um... well,

06:24.176 --> 06:26.761
(school bell rings)

06:26.803 --> 06:28.305
All right, guys, just, uh...

06:28.347 --> 06:29.806
hand me your sonnets
on the way out.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.516
And get excited

06:31.558 --> 06:33.768
'cause tomorrow you're all
going to read these out loud.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.103
Thanks. Hey Ivy,

06:35.145 --> 06:35.979
can I talk to you for a sec?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.691
Um...

06:39.733 --> 06:40.942
yeah. What's up?

06:40.984 --> 06:43.237
Are you doing okay?

06:43.278 --> 06:45.197
(nervous laugh)
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.241
'Kay, it's just, you know,

06:47.282 --> 06:48.700
I'm still waiting
on your Chaucer paper.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.993
It's a week past due.

06:50.035 --> 06:53.538
Yeah. Sorry about that. Um,

06:53.580 --> 06:54.956
I'll-I'll get that to you,
like, ASAP.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.334
And your sonnet?
Uh,

06:57.376 --> 06:59.920
yeah. My sonnet.
I'll get that to you, too.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.924
Thanks.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.508
I swear,

07:05.550 --> 07:09.263
I am burning these gym clothes
the day I graduate.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.348
(laughs)
We'll have a bonfire on the
football field.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.016
How about at
Ms. Mangold's desk?

07:13.058 --> 07:14.393
NAOMI:
Even better.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.353
MS. MANGOLD:
Naomi, Silver!

07:16.395 --> 07:18.397
Why am I always waiting
on you two?

07:18.479 --> 07:21.400
There are, like, 30,000 people
still in here.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.734
And how much do you want
to bet you two

07:22.776 --> 07:23.985
will still be the last ones out?

07:24.027 --> 07:24.986
How about a year's salary?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.029
What was that, Naomi?

07:26.071 --> 07:29.408
Coming, Ms. Mangold!

07:29.449 --> 07:30.784
(growly murmur)

07:32.911 --> 07:34.788
Hi!
Hey!

07:34.829 --> 07:35.914
What are you doing here?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.749
I figured out who Navid
was cheating with.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.626
Who?

07:46.133 --> 07:47.092
(gasps)

07:47.134 --> 07:49.928
Lila?
Lila.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.846
Why do you think it's... Lila?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.433
I mean, it's obvious.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.060
They used to date,
they do the Blaze together,

07:57.102 --> 07:59.438
and I always see them in the
hallway being way too chatty

07:59.479 --> 08:01.773
and cozy with each other.
Makes sense.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.191
Pigs always return
to their trough.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.943
I'm going to make
that girl's life hell.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.903
Ade, you can't.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.405
You don't have proof, right?

08:08.447 --> 08:11.032
What if it was somebody else?
Dodgeball again!

08:11.074 --> 08:12.242
You girls psyched or what?

08:12.284 --> 08:13.493
Whoo-hoo!

08:13.534 --> 08:15.954
Hey, can't wait.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.956
I know it's her.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.000
It's got to be.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.876
She's such a
nice person.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.544
Apparently not.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.341
All right, well, anyway, I...

08:27.382 --> 08:30.010
I got to get going. I have
a meeting in, like, 20 minutes.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.346
I just had to tell you guys.
Wow.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.514
Have fun in P.E.
Okay.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.183
NAOMI:
Oh, my God.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.458
You've been avoiding me.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.836
No I haven't.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.380
Come on, Liam. Every time
I see you in the hall,

09:06.421 --> 09:08.006
you turn around
and walk the other way.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.384
Is it because of what happened
the other night at your place?

09:10.425 --> 09:13.303
Well... yeah.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.471
It kind of took me by surprise.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.639
I know. I'm sorry.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.975
I never should have
come onto you like that.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.852
It was totally inappropriate.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.606
I, you know, I was just really
upset and emotional

09:25.648 --> 09:28.985
and you were being so wonderful
and sweet to me, I just...

09:29.027 --> 09:30.195
I got carried away.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.280
(laughs)

09:32.322 --> 09:33.573
But I promise,
it won't happen again.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.326

09:36.368 --> 09:38.412
I'm not mad.

09:38.453 --> 09:42.416

09:42.457 --> 09:44.418
I'm actually kind of flattered.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.671
I'm just dealing with
a lot right now,

09:48.713 --> 09:51.591
I mean, with Annie acting all
crazy and getting suspended,

09:51.632 --> 09:53.927
I'm just not sure
where my head is at.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.136
(under her breath):
Yeah.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.930
I just need some time
to figure things out.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.557
Of course.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.267
You know, I'll-I'll be here
for you

10:00.308 --> 10:03.437
if you ever want to... talk.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.313
Thanks, Emily.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.166
Time to get my math on.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.633
Hmm.

(awkward chuckle)
What are you doing here?
Are you feeling okay?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.994
Yeah, no, uh...

11:01.035 --> 11:02.329
I just was going to see
if I could

11:02.370 --> 11:04.164
get one of these... dorks
to do my homework for me.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.415
But no need...

11:05.457 --> 11:06.541
I can just get the answers
online.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.213
Hey-hey, what's up, blood?

11:12.255 --> 11:13.632
Hey.

11:13.672 --> 11:16.468
How's, uh, life
at Shirazi Studios?

11:16.510 --> 11:17.676
Really good, man.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.762
I've got a Beverly Hills
plastic surgeon

11:19.804 --> 11:21.973
who may want to shoot
a series of commercials.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.100
Wow. That's awesome.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.435
Yeah.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.228
Yeah. I was actually hoping

11:27.270 --> 11:28.896
that you might have some time
after school to help me out.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.526
Mm-hmm.
Who knows? Um, I want to do some
more cold calling around town,

11:32.567 --> 11:33.568
see if we can't scare up
some more business.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.154
And since Dixon Wilson
is a master...

11:36.196 --> 11:38.573
Oh, yes, yes,
I am the master.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.741
(laughs)
And the master
is at your service.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.661
Dude, I can't even get over
how smooth you are

11:42.701 --> 11:44.412
with these clients;
I almost feel bad for them.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.456
Nah, it's a gift.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.082
I wanted to ask you something.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.417
You know, I need
to start earning money

11:49.459 --> 11:50.918
for college and everything,

11:50.960 --> 11:53.380
so I was wondering, you know...
and-and it's cool if...

11:53.421 --> 11:55.173
if you say "no," whatever,

11:55.215 --> 11:58.468
but, um, I was thinking
maybe we could

11:58.510 --> 12:00.554
um, formalize our arrangement.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.430
You're hired.
Really?

12:02.472 --> 12:04.098
Yeah, of course, man.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.392
I couldn't do this without you.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.269

12:08.311 --> 12:10.564

12:17.153 --> 12:19.406
Hey!

12:19.447 --> 12:20.615
You ready to hit
the half-pipe?

12:20.657 --> 12:22.367
I've been dreaming about it
all day.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.661
Mm. So, how was your day?

12:24.703 --> 12:26.079
What'd you do?
Did you go to class?

12:26.120 --> 12:27.622
Nah.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.541
I made my schedule so
I don't have classes

12:29.583 --> 12:32.252
Tuesdays or Thursdays
this semester.
Aah... college.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.461
It does not suck.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.753
So, what'd you do?

12:34.795 --> 12:37.131
I had an epic day.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.800
I went down to Venice this
morning to watch the sunrise

12:39.842 --> 12:43.638
and hang out,
then I decided
to rent a bike.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.306
And I pedaled
all the way
to Malibu.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.392
No way.
Yeah.
Malibu. Are you crazy?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.227
Yeah, I ran into some
of my boys at Zuma.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.520
And we were gonna surf,

12:50.562 --> 12:52.731
but we ended up swimming
with a bunch of dolphins...

12:52.813 --> 12:54.148
(laughing):
Shut up!

12:54.190 --> 12:55.734
... like we were
in SeaWorld or
something.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.069
That is insane!

12:58.111 --> 12:59.654
How was your day?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.239
Uh...

13:01.281 --> 13:02.823
Yeah, I could tell you about it,

13:02.865 --> 13:04.117
but I don't want you
to fall asleep at the wheel.

what's been going on with you.

you went after Emily

You know that's not me!
Annie, I...

I just think we should
take some... some time off.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.855

Fine.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.110
He's a plastic surgeon,

19:54.152 --> 19:56.029
so appearances are obviously
very important to him.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.113
So I'll pick him up
in the Ferrari,

19:57.155 --> 19:58.781
take him to Urasawa,

19:58.823 --> 20:01.117
and, uh, maybe get him a
little drunk on some sake.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.619
And have him sign...
on the line...

20:03.661 --> 20:05.038
that is dotted.

20:05.079 --> 20:08.124
Sounds like a plan.
(laughs)

20:08.166 --> 20:10.209
Oh, hey? Will you take the
Ferrari to get it detailed?

20:11.919 --> 20:14.672
I love my job!
Thank you, boss.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.101
Mom wants to know

20:27.143 --> 20:29.228
if you want to come to the movie
with all of us tonight.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.815
You're being awfully pleasant.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.777

20:38.278 --> 20:39.906
I don't want to
fight anymore.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.742
I just really want
my life back.

20:42.783 --> 20:43.784
Can we call a truce?

20:43.826 --> 20:45.828
Please?

20:47.121 --> 20:48.915
Sure.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.583
But I still
can't go out with you.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.585
I have... other plans.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.212
Okay. Um,

20:54.253 --> 20:55.755
we're probably gonna
grab dinner after,

20:55.796 --> 20:56.756

27:03.122 --> 27:06.375

Geez. You're right.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.294
You've proved your point,
I find you attractive.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.045

27:22.182 --> 27:23.309
I'll see you.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.145
Wait.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.313
What...

27:27.354 --> 27:29.689
Well, I didn't get

27:29.731 --> 27:31.649
all dressed up like
this just because

27:31.691 --> 27:33.651
I wanted to prove a point;
I did this because I...

27:33.693 --> 27:36.696
Mm. Well, I...

27:38.491 --> 27:40.033
Because I like you!
God knows why,

27:40.075 --> 27:41.160
but I do.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.830
And...

27:44.871 --> 27:46.165
I...

27:46.206 --> 27:47.207
You really like me?

27:48.750 --> 27:54.340
No, I mean, like,
actually on a human level.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.466
Like me?

27:56.925 --> 27:59.094
Yeah.

27:59.136 --> 28:00.971
I think you're funny,
and smart, and...

28:01.013 --> 28:03.015
freakishly confident, and...

28:03.056 --> 28:05.767
And I think you're hot, too.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.033
(exhales)
Look.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.494
We're going to have to

28:23.536 --> 28:25.579
It could really
hurt my reputation.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.998

exact same thing.

28:38.342 --> 28:39.635
Where do you go, you know?

28:39.677 --> 28:42.304
I'm just saying
I could do it.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.430
Yeah, and I'm just saying
that you'd die.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.390
You'd fall on your
face, snap your neck,

28:44.431 --> 28:45.683
and you'd die.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.766
Well, I'll just have
to buy a snowmobile,

28:46.808 --> 28:49.019
enter the winter X-games
and prove you wrong.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.063
Okay. I'll bring
a body bag.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.606
Wow. I thought my parents
were the only ones on earth

28:52.648 --> 28:54.358
who still use an
answering machine.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.651
Oh, my God.
It gets worse, okay?

28:55.693 --> 28:57.319
She makes me do this

28:57.361 --> 28:58.487
really embarrassing message

28:58.529 --> 28:59.738
where we alternate
our voices, like,

28:59.779 --> 29:01.365

"Hi. We. Aren't.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.534
"Here. Right. Now. So.
Please. Leave.

29:03.576 --> 29:06.495
A. Message. At. The. Beep."
Oh, my God. It is so corny.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.288
That's the price you pay
for living at home.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.748
Yeah. Right?

29:09.789 --> 29:11.625
Hey, why do you live
with your parents?

29:11.667 --> 29:13.335
I just figured you'd have
a spot on campus or something.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.212
You can't beat the rent.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.672

Hey. Laurel, it's Ryan.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.801
Um, I just wanted
to touch base with you.

29:21.843 --> 29:25.097
I'm a little concerned
about Ivy's work

29:25.138 --> 29:27.057
and-and attitude
at school lately,

29:27.099 --> 29:28.850
and, I don't know, I'd like
to talk to you about it.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.644
So call me when you
get a second. Thanks.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.771
Okay, then again,
there are advantages

29:32.812 --> 29:34.022
to having an answering machine.

to do tonight?

29:38.569 --> 29:40.028
Ivy, you can't do this.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.530
Do what?

29:41.572 --> 29:43.407
You can't smoke pot all day

29:43.449 --> 29:45.284
and blow off school
and make a mess of your life.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.702
Whoa, okay. Raj,

29:46.744 --> 29:48.245
I'm not making
a mess of my life.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.580
Yes, you are.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.331
And I'm not going to
be a part of that.

29:51.373 --> 29:52.499
You're not taking
anything seriously.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.209
Like, this has
got to stop.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.629
Okay, I'm sorry.
You're one to talk, Raj.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.089
You barely go to school.
You spend every day

29:59.131 --> 30:00.633
doing whatever the hell
you want to do.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.134
I mean, you're the one who's not
taking anything seriously.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.594
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.387
Because I'm some
high school kid or something?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.264
That's right.
Okay, dude, that's...

30:07.306 --> 30:08.724
That's unfair.

30:08.766 --> 30:12.227
I mean, you're being
a total hypocrite, okay?

30:12.269 --> 30:14.396
I'm going to go.

the lowest prices in town.

And I assure you that
