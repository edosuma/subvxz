WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.921
MALCOLM:

00:02.085 --> 00:03.921
This is the world--

00:03.963 --> 00:05.213
196 million square miles.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.549
If I covered 100 square miles

00:05.255 --> 00:07.549
an hour

00:07.591 --> 00:09.718
every hour

00:07.591 --> 00:09.718
for the rest of my life

00:09.760 --> 00:11.846
I'd still only see half of it.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.054
(squeaking)

00:13.096 --> 00:15.975
This is the left nostril

00:13.096 --> 00:15.975
of my brother Reese.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.353
It squeaks all night long.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.271
These are

00:19.394 --> 00:21.271
the freezing cold feet

00:21.313 --> 00:23.315
of my little brother... Dewey.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.651
This is my oldest brother

00:23.357 --> 00:25.651
Francis.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.361
He's the one I really like

00:27.402 --> 00:30.238
so, of course,  he got sent

00:27.402 --> 00:30.238
to military school.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.490
My name is Malcolm.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.659
You want to know

00:31.532 --> 00:33.659
what the best thing

00:33.701 --> 00:34.743
about childhood is?

00:34.785 --> 00:37.078

There's only two

01:22.750 --> 01:24.043
toaster waffles.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.544
One of you has

01:24.083 --> 01:25.544
to have cereal.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.755
It's mine!

01:27.796 --> 01:28.923
Come on!

01:28.964 --> 01:30.007
Give it!

01:30.049 --> 01:31.132
You cheated!

01:31.174 --> 01:32.384
Give it! Give it!

01:32.426 --> 01:35.136
Huh, look at this.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.932
They're sending

01:35.178 --> 01:37.932
an unmanned

01:35.178 --> 01:37.932
probe to Venus

01:37.973 --> 01:41.142
and letting a bunch of

01:37.973 --> 01:41.142
schoolchildren name it.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.853
Well, that's going

01:41.184 --> 01:42.853
to end badly.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.145
They do this every month.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.188
He has sensitive skin.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.983
The hair gets itchy

01:45.230 --> 01:47.983
under his clothes.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.359
It always seems

01:48.025 --> 01:49.359
like such a shame

01:49.401 --> 01:51.152
to just dump this

01:49.401 --> 01:51.152
in the trash.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.821
Maybe birds would like

01:51.194 --> 01:52.821
to make nests with it

01:52.863 --> 01:55.532
or, I don't know, maybe

01:52.863 --> 01:55.532
you boys could use it

01:52.863 --> 01:55.532
for school projects.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.825
Arms up.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.744
Malcolm, come right home

01:56.867 --> 01:58.744
from school.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.245
Dude.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.663
Malcolm, you come right home

02:00.287 --> 02:01.663
from school today.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.164
I made a play date for you

02:01.705 --> 02:03.164
with Stevie Kenarban

02:03.206 --> 02:04.165
and you have

02:03.206 --> 02:04.165
to take a bath.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.043
What? Mom, no!

02:06.085 --> 02:07.168
Malcolm

02:06.085 --> 02:07.168
has a play date?!

02:07.210 --> 02:08.211
Shut up, Reese!

02:08.253 --> 02:10.338
With Stevie "The

02:08.253 --> 02:10.338
Wheelie" Kenarban?

02:10.380 --> 02:11.256
Oh, man!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.759
Why is playing

02:11.298 --> 02:13.759
a problem for you?

02:13.801 --> 02:15.385
First off,

02:15.427 --> 02:17.178
I don't even know Stevie.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.178
I saw his mother

02:17.220 --> 02:19.556
at the grocery story. She said

02:17.220 --> 02:19.556
you boys ate lunch together.

02:19.598 --> 02:20.641
One time.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.643
He rolled his wheelchair

02:20.682 --> 02:22.643
over next to me.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.186
It's not like

02:22.684 --> 02:25.186
I couldn't say, "go away."

02:25.228 --> 02:27.188
He's not even

02:25.228 --> 02:27.188
in my class.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.273
He's in the Krelboyne class

02:28.315 --> 02:30.067
in the trailer

02:28.315 --> 02:30.067
next to tetherball.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.568
You listen to me,

02:30.109 --> 02:31.568
young man.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.904
That one lunch obviously

02:31.610 --> 02:33.904
meant a lot to Stevie.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.614
He's a human being

02:33.946 --> 02:35.614
with human feelings.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.199
Now, you are going

02:35.656 --> 02:38.199
to be friends with

02:35.656 --> 02:38.199
that crippled boy

02:38.241 --> 02:40.201
and you are going

02:38.241 --> 02:40.201
to like it. Understood?

02:40.243 --> 02:42.079
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

02:42.121 --> 02:45.373
If I give up now,

02:42.121 --> 02:45.373
I won't get the lecture.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.042
You kids...

02:45.415 --> 02:47.042
Dang.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.794
You just take your legs

02:47.084 --> 02:48.794
for granted, you know?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.212
Like nothing could

02:48.836 --> 02:51.212
ever happen to them.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.212
Well, let me tell you something.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.380
That is just

02:51.254 --> 02:52.380
wishful thinking.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.215
There's meningitis.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.215
There are car accidents.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.301
I could be giving

02:54.257 --> 02:56.301
you a spanking

02:56.343 --> 02:58.053
and accidentally snap

02:56.343 --> 02:58.053
your spinal cord.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.513
Every day is a lottery

02:59.554 --> 03:01.515
and first prize

02:59.554 --> 03:01.515
is that you don't have to scoot

03:01.556 --> 03:04.225
yourself around town on

03:01.556 --> 03:04.225
a skateboard with your hands.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.393
You think about that.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.813
I don't take my legs

03:05.435 --> 03:07.813
for granted, Mom.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.231
I know, honey,

03:07.855 --> 03:10.231
you're a good boy.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.526
Stop playing with yourself.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.821
(boys arguing)

03:15.863 --> 03:17.280
Go on, just go.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.240
LOIS:

03:17.322 --> 03:19.240
No, wait, wait, wait.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.450
Okay, okay, okay,

03:19.282 --> 03:20.450
I ran out of ham.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.037
One of you has

03:20.492 --> 03:23.037
to have egg salad, okay?

03:23.078 --> 03:24.872
And don't ditch

03:23.078 --> 03:24.872
your little brother.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.498
I don't want him

03:24.913 --> 03:26.498
getting kidnapped.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.250
Yeah, Mom, that

03:26.540 --> 03:29.250
would be terrible.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.961
It's your turn

03:29.292 --> 03:30.961
to walk with him.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.754
I walked him yesterday

03:31.003 --> 03:32.754
and the day before.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.465
I walked with him

03:32.796 --> 03:35.465
when he wet his pants.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.176
Okay.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.264
Mom said to hold hands.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.933
She did not say

03:43.306 --> 03:44.933
to hold hands, Dewey.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.267
I'm not holding hands.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
Come on, hold hands. Please?

03:48.311 --> 03:50.313
No! You're in

03:48.311 --> 03:50.313
the first grade.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.315
You're too big for that.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.861
Look, I'm walking

03:52.357 --> 03:55.861
right next to you.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.696
You'll be fine.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.283
Damn it! This is why

03:58.780 --> 04:02.283
everyone teases you.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.869
Hey, Malcolm.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.912
Hey, Richard.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.789
So my mom was telling

04:04.953 --> 04:07.789
my dad last night

04:07.831 --> 04:09.083
about your brother.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.959
She said he's in jail.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.293
He's not in jail.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.879
He's at Marlin Academy.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.298
It's, like, one of the

04:13.921 --> 04:17.298
best private schools

04:13.921 --> 04:17.298
in the country

04:17.340 --> 04:18.884
and it's totally unfair.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.303
Everyone acts like Francis

04:18.926 --> 04:22.303
is just this big troublemaker

04:22.345 --> 04:23.513
and he's not.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.682
Dad, I know

04:23.555 --> 04:25.682
what you're going to say

04:25.724 --> 04:28.309
and believe me,

04:25.724 --> 04:28.309
I totally agree with you.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.104
There is no excuse

04:28.351 --> 04:30.104
for what I did.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.898
It was idiotic, immature,

04:30.145 --> 04:32.898
totally reckless

04:32.940 --> 04:34.399
and I'm really sorry.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.317
I'm just...

04:34.441 --> 04:36.317
I'm hoping against hope

04:36.359 --> 04:39.404
that you will give me

04:36.359 --> 04:39.404
another chance, which, I admit

04:39.446 --> 04:40.822
I don't deserve

04:40.864 --> 04:44.034
but if you could just

04:40.864 --> 04:44.034
find it in your heart

04:44.076 --> 04:45.326
to forgive me

04:45.368 --> 04:48.247
I know I could earn

04:45.368 --> 04:48.247
your trust back.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.832
It's not like it

04:48.288 --> 04:50.832
was even our car.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.333
Spath, Spath, Spath!

04:52.375 --> 04:54.753
Spath:

04:52.375 --> 04:54.753
All right,

04:54.795 --> 04:56.255
Here's how it works.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.339
You can beg for mercy

04:56.296 --> 04:58.339
on your belly

04:58.381 --> 05:00.634
lick the bottom

04:58.381 --> 05:00.634
of my shoes

05:00.675 --> 05:02.219
or take a beating.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.345
You must pick at least two

05:04.387 --> 05:06.347
but... but-but,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.347
if you pick three

05:06.389 --> 05:08.725
you get a pass

05:06.389 --> 05:08.725
for the next two weeks.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.185
All right?

05:10.227 --> 05:11.937
Now, that's your best value.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.396
MALCOLM:

05:11.979 --> 05:13.396
Dave Spath.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.065
He never gets sent anywhere.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.358
What do you do

05:15.107 --> 05:17.358
if he catches you?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.359
Roll in a ball.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.237
What if he starts

05:18.401 --> 05:20.237
kicking you?

05:20.279 --> 05:21.780
Stay in a ball.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.740
Okay. Come on.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.159
(kids yelling)

05:25.200 --> 05:26.785
Wait.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.371
Never mind.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.458
(kids continue yelling)

05:35.585 --> 05:38.379
WOMAN:

05:35.585 --> 05:38.379
Those of you finished

05:35.585 --> 05:38.379
with your tempera paints

05:38.421 --> 05:39.380
may bring your work up here

05:39.422 --> 05:40.632
and start on

05:39.422 --> 05:40.632
your charcoal still lifes.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.093
You may take

05:40.674 --> 05:43.093
two pieces of

05:40.674 --> 05:43.093
fruit only

05:43.135 --> 05:44.970
and please be careful with them.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.388
I bought them with my own money.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.267
My  own  money.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.604
God, Malcolm, that's so good.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.487
Oh, Malcolm,

06:01.320 --> 06:02.487
this is wonderful.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.073
The perspective

06:02.529 --> 06:05.073
is good.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.407
The composition is clean

06:06.449 --> 06:08.576
and it even shows signs

06:06.449 --> 06:08.576
of actual technique.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.829
I have to say

06:08.618 --> 06:10.829
this is the high

06:08.618 --> 06:10.829
point of my day.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.413
(laughs)

06:12.455 --> 06:14.541
How's that for sad?

06:20.505 --> 06:21.923
(squishing)

06:29.097 --> 06:30.098
Are you okay?

06:30.140 --> 06:32.267
Um, yeah, I'm fine.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.810
TEACHER:

06:32.309 --> 06:33.810
Malcolm.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.853
What?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.938
They need to see you

06:34.895 --> 06:36.938
in the office.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.234
Okay.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.362
I think they mean right now.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.946
Okay.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.493
Get up, Malcolm.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.082
(kids' laughter echoing)

06:58.210 --> 06:59.836
Hi. I'm Caroline.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.462
Want to have a seat?

07:02.505 --> 07:04.383
Are you Malcolm?

07:04.423 --> 07:07.177
Yes, and I didn't

07:04.423 --> 07:07.177
do anything.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.469
You're not in trouble, Malcolm.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.264
You're here

07:08.511 --> 07:10.264
'cause some of your teachers

07:10.305 --> 07:11.765
think you're, um...

07:10.305 --> 07:11.765
you know what?

07:11.806 --> 07:14.475
I just want to play

07:11.806 --> 07:14.475
some games with you.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.062
Okay? Puzzles,

07:14.517 --> 07:17.062
stuff like that.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.062
Why?

07:17.104 --> 07:18.730
Boy, oh, boy

07:18.772 --> 07:21.858
you are a suspicious

07:18.772 --> 07:21.858
little dickens, aren't you?

07:21.900 --> 07:26.363
Okay. Now, you can look

07:21.900 --> 07:26.363
at this picture for 60 seconds

07:26.405 --> 07:27.488
and I want you to tell me

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
everything that's wrong

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
with it, okay?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.326
The man only has

07:29.532 --> 07:31.326
four fingers.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.494
Right, but this time

07:33.536 --> 07:36.706
I want you to take your time

07:33.536 --> 07:36.706
and really look...

07:36.748 --> 07:38.708
The car shadow's

07:36.748 --> 07:38.708
going the wrong way,

07:38.750 --> 07:40.501
the steering wheel's

07:38.750 --> 07:40.501
on the wrong side,

07:40.543 --> 07:41.878
there's no

07:40.543 --> 07:41.878
brake pedal,

07:41.920 --> 07:43.504
the words in the mirror

07:41.920 --> 07:43.504

07:43.546 --> 07:45.424

07:45.465 --> 07:47.301
if he's looking at a sunset

07:47.342 --> 07:49.303
and I have red paint on my ass.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.387
That's right.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.390
Red paint all over my ass!

09:49.464 --> 09:52.092
No way. I'd wreck it.

Oh... did you read

09:52.133 --> 09:55.636
the last  Savage Dragon

09:57.389 --> 09:59.640
Yeah. Brilliant.

I like how he never has

09:59.682 --> 10:02.477
to learn a lesson or anything.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.979

Damn!

10:24.624 --> 10:26.667
You boys,

10:24.624 --> 10:26.667
you keep this house clean

10:26.709 --> 10:28.169
till your dad comes home.

Two of you can have

I don't know.

I think they're peas.

Somebody get that.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.096
Not it.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.683
Hello.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.144
Young master Malcolm.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.520
Francis, hi.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.938
Hey, man,

10:46.980 --> 10:48.689
I wrote you guys

10:46.980 --> 10:48.689
a really long letter yesterday,

10:48.731 --> 10:50.858
but, listen, they only gave me,

10:48.731 --> 10:50.858
like, three minutes,

10:50.900 --> 10:53.069
so would you put

10:50.900 --> 10:53.069
the special prosecutor on?

10:53.111 --> 10:55.405
Mom, it's Francis.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.700
Hey, Francis, how's school?

10:59.742 --> 11:01.202
Oh, couldn't be better, Mom.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.371
My new roommate showed me

11:01.244 --> 11:03.371
how to kill mice

11:03.413 --> 11:06.291
with a hammer yesterday,

11:03.413 --> 11:06.291
so, you know, between that

11:06.333 --> 11:09.085
and the general atmosphere

11:06.333 --> 11:09.085
of simmering homoeroticism,

11:09.127 --> 11:11.421
I think I'm really starting

11:09.127 --> 11:11.421
to turn around.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.713
Honey, it's only until summer.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.215
Come on, push it!

11:14.257 --> 11:15.883
Give it up,

11:14.257 --> 11:15.883
prom date.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.428
Yeah, listen, um...

11:15.925 --> 11:18.428
I know I shouldn't ask,

11:18.470 --> 11:19.720
but would you be able

11:19.762 --> 11:22.723
to send me my allowance,

11:19.762 --> 11:22.723
like, a couple weeks early

11:22.765 --> 11:23.724
'cause I kind of need some...?

11:23.766 --> 11:25.726
Oh, my God! Are you smoking?

11:25.768 --> 11:26.811
What?

11:25.768 --> 11:26.811
I can hear you smoking.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.647
You're smoking, aren't you?

11:28.687 --> 11:30.731
Mom, I'm not smoking. Geez.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.983
After seeing the anguish

11:32.025 --> 11:33.527
your father and I

11:32.025 --> 11:33.527
went through to quit,

11:33.568 --> 11:36.112
didn't any of that

11:33.568 --> 11:36.112
register with you?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.405
Okay, listen.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.781
I'll talk to your dad.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.741
Maybe we can send you

11:38.823 --> 11:40.741
part of it.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.410
Honey, I have to go.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.744
I'm late for work.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.829
I'll call you later.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.123
Okay, thanks, Mom. I love you.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.458
(dial tone)

11:48.500 --> 11:51.211
Oh... I love you.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.756
(doorbell rings)

11:55.798 --> 11:57.758
Somebody get the door!

11:57.800 --> 11:59.469
I'm not getting it.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.469
You get it, butt-munch.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.761
Shut up.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.761
You shut up.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.639
No, you shut up!

12:00.803 --> 12:02.639
Make me!

12:02.681 --> 12:04.057
I'll make you right now!

12:06.393 --> 12:09.229
You'd better not be fighting

12:06.393 --> 12:09.229
in there, Reese, Malcolm.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.482
Not my face!

12:12.524 --> 12:14.025
I said you'd better not

12:12.524 --> 12:14.025
be fighting in...

12:14.067 --> 12:14.775
(doorbell rings)

12:14.817 --> 12:16.777
For crying out loud.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.113
Reese! Malcolm!

12:21.824 --> 12:23.368
Yes. Can I help you?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.869
Oh. My good... um, hi.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.287
Hel... hello. I'm....

12:26.329 --> 12:28.789
Are you...? I'm...

12:26.329 --> 12:28.789
Caroline Miller

12:28.831 --> 12:30.709
from Malcolm's school.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.001
I sent you some letters

12:32.043 --> 12:34.962
and left some messages

12:32.043 --> 12:34.962
on your answering machine.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.673
Okay, fine. You caught me.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.673
What do you want?

12:36.715 --> 12:38.799
Um... well, it's

12:36.715 --> 12:38.799
been three weeks

12:38.841 --> 12:40.968
and you haven't responded,

12:38.841 --> 12:40.968
and it's really important,

12:41.010 --> 12:42.803
I mean, well,

12:41.010 --> 12:42.803
for Malcolm's sake

12:42.845 --> 12:44.013
that the parents be

12:42.845 --> 12:44.013
as involved in...

12:44.055 --> 12:46.807
So, what, you're here to insult

12:44.055 --> 12:46.807
my parenting skills?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
No. I'm sure you're

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
a terrific parent.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.811
(boys yelling)

12:54.524 --> 12:56.025
I'm here because I think

12:56.067 --> 12:58.486
that there is a tremendous

12:56.067 --> 12:58.486
opportunity for...

12:58.528 --> 13:01.072
Could you, you know,

12:58.528 --> 13:01.072
maybe put a top on?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.198
They're just boobs, lady.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.824
You see them in a mirror

13:02.240 --> 13:03.824
every morning.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.535
And I'm sure yours

13:03.866 --> 13:05.535
are a lot nicer than mine.

13:05.577 --> 13:06.827
That's actually not...

13:05.577 --> 13:06.827
You know what?

13:06.869 --> 13:07.870
I'm gonna tell you

13:06.869 --> 13:07.870
something else.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.122
The reason I didn't respond

13:09.163 --> 13:11.832
is because it is

13:09.163 --> 13:11.832
a load of crap.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.832
What?

13:11.874 --> 13:13.543
You are not going

13:11.874 --> 13:13.543
to stick my Malcolm

13:13.585 --> 13:14.419
in some special ed class.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.836
What is it

13:14.461 --> 13:15.836
with you people?

13:15.878 --> 13:17.464
Why do you feel you have

13:15.878 --> 13:17.464
to label everybody?

13:17.505 --> 13:18.839
Malcolm may be a little strange,

13:18.881 --> 13:20.841
and, I know, I know,

13:18.881 --> 13:20.841
he never shuts up,

13:20.883 --> 13:22.051
but he is not disturbed.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.844
You know, he is a good boy...

13:23.886 --> 13:25.221
Please!

13:25.263 --> 13:28.266
You know what? You don't

13:25.263 --> 13:28.266
understand at all, okay?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.351
So if I could just

13:28.308 --> 13:30.351
come in for a minute,

13:30.393 --> 13:32.853
I could explain

13:30.393 --> 13:32.853
everything, okay?

13:34.939 --> 13:37.066
REESE:

13:34.939 --> 13:37.066
Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:44.616 --> 13:47.994
(china clattering)

14:03.301 --> 14:04.594
It's good, hon.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.223
There's something

14:06.929 --> 14:09.223
we have to talk about.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.147
I thought we weren't going

14:13.728 --> 14:16.147
to mention Aunt Helen

14:16.189 --> 14:18.775
till after the biopsy.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.775
It's not that.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.276
It's about Malcolm.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.276
I didn't do it.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.695
Yes, he did.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.695
I saw him.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.112
A teacher

14:21.736 --> 14:23.112
from school came by

14:23.154 --> 14:26.616
and she ran

14:23.154 --> 14:26.616
some tests with Malcolm.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.909
He has an IQ of 165.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.911
Who?

14:30.953 --> 14:32.747
Malcolm. He's a genius.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.708
He's going

14:32.789 --> 14:34.708
to a special class.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.793
What?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.793
Malcolm's special?

14:36.835 --> 14:38.378
Where do you think

14:36.835 --> 14:38.378
that came from?

14:38.419 --> 14:40.296
They have a special program

14:38.419 --> 14:40.296
for gifted children.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.173
They have advanced textbooks

14:40.338 --> 14:42.173
and devoted teachers

14:42.215 --> 14:43.924
and all sorts of good things

14:42.215 --> 14:43.924
they don't want to waste

14:43.966 --> 14:46.093
on normal kids.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.093
You start on Monday.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.928
You're going to put him

14:46.135 --> 14:47.928
in the Krelboyne class?

14:47.970 --> 14:49.930
Mom, no! I don't want to!

14:49.972 --> 14:51.766
What are you talking about?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.100
Of course you want to.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.936
No. I want to stay

14:53.142 --> 14:55.936
in my own class.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.605
I don't want to be a Krelboyne.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.525
Mom, seriously, Krelboynes

14:57.647 --> 15:00.525
get their butts kicked.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.943
Just stop one minute.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.321
There's nothing wrong

15:02.985 --> 15:05.321
with being smart.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.365
And there's nothing wrong

15:05.363 --> 15:07.365
with being cut from the herd.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.534
It makes you the one buffalo

15:07.407 --> 15:09.534
that isn't there

15:09.576 --> 15:11.244
when the Indians run

15:09.576 --> 15:11.244
the rest of them off the cliff.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.953
Huh?

15:12.995 --> 15:14.455
Mom, this isn't fair!

15:14.497 --> 15:16.957
If I don't want to go,

15:14.497 --> 15:16.957
why do I have to?

15:16.999 --> 15:18.959
Because it's not

15:16.999 --> 15:18.959
just up to you.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.045
We have to do

15:19.001 --> 15:21.045
what's best for you.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.963
Mom, please!

15:21.087 --> 15:22.963
Don't make me go!

15:23.005 --> 15:24.340
Please!

15:24.382 --> 15:25.966
Malcolm, calm down.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.966
But it isn't fair!

15:26.008 --> 15:27.594
That's right.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.594
It isn't fair.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.846
It's the first time

15:27.635 --> 15:29.846
anyone in this family

15:29.888 --> 15:31.013
has ever been given an edge,

15:31.055 --> 15:32.973
and you are not

15:31.055 --> 15:32.973
going to waste it.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.268
Dad?

15:33.015 --> 15:35.268
Honey?

15:37.019 --> 15:40.648
Well... look, honey...

15:41.941 --> 15:46.654
Malcolm, you see...

15:49.031 --> 15:51.158
Oh, for crying out loud.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.160
How come there's never

15:51.200 --> 15:53.160
any iced tea in this pitcher?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.371
I make a fresh batch

15:53.202 --> 15:55.371
every morning;

15:55.413 --> 15:57.791
it's gone

15:55.413 --> 15:57.791
by the time I get home.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.167
I want a better family!

16:00.209 --> 16:02.879
Malcolm...

16:02.921 --> 16:03.880
Look at that.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.215
Gone.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.175
I don't want to go

16:06.257 --> 16:08.175
to a special class.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.010
People think I'm

16:08.217 --> 16:10.010
weird enough already.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053
I know.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.013
I like where I am.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.013
I want to stay.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.015
Sweetie, life does

16:13.055 --> 16:15.015
not give you

16:15.057 --> 16:17.811
a lot of chances to move up,

16:15.057 --> 16:17.811
even if you deserve it.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.019
Look at your dad and me.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.522
Malcolm, I'm proud of you.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.441
You boys are so lucky.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.860
You have so many gifts

16:23.483 --> 16:25.860
that other kids don't have.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.404
And I just don't mean

16:25.902 --> 16:28.404
Stevie Kenarban, either.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.031
I mean, look at those

16:28.446 --> 16:31.031
Parker boys across the street.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.867
They may be healthy,

16:31.073 --> 16:32.867
but honest to God,

16:32.909 --> 16:35.035
those are the ugliest

16:32.909 --> 16:35.035
little boys ever born.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.121
They look like boiled beets,

16:35.077 --> 16:37.121
don't you think?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.289
And those Henderson kids?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.332
That electrocuted their dog

16:39.373 --> 16:41.459
when they were trying

16:39.373 --> 16:41.459
to get free cable.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.543
How smart can they be?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.044
Just remember,

16:44.086 --> 16:47.256
any kid who makes fun of you

16:44.086 --> 16:47.256
is a creepy little loser

16:47.298 --> 16:49.676
who'll end up working

16:47.298 --> 16:49.676
in a car wash.

16:49.717 --> 16:54.054
This shouldn't make me

16:49.717 --> 16:54.054
feel better, but it does.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.056
You'll be all right, sweetie.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.434
If you don't make

16:56.098 --> 16:58.434
a big deal out of this,

16:58.476 --> 17:00.060
nobody else will either.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.646
And I just can't say enough

17:01.688 --> 17:04.315
about how proud

17:01.688 --> 17:04.315
we should all be of Malcolm

17:04.357 --> 17:06.442
for getting into

17:04.357 --> 17:06.442
the gifted program.

17:06.484 --> 17:09.320
Now, Malcolm may not look

17:06.484 --> 17:09.320
different than the rest of us,

17:09.362 --> 17:10.947
but he is.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.073
Very  different.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.242
In his brain.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.913
And I think we should

17:15.284 --> 17:18.913
recognize him for that.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.918
Bye.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.169
CAROLINE:

17:23.960 --> 17:25.169
All righty,

17:25.211 --> 17:27.087
today we are starting

17:25.211 --> 17:27.087
a new section

17:27.129 --> 17:28.130
on the Peloponnesian War,

17:28.172 --> 17:31.175
which I know

17:28.172 --> 17:31.175
you are all going to love.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.093
Malcolm?

17:33.135 --> 17:36.556
Are you okay?

17:37.849 --> 17:40.727
Uh, yeah. Fine.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.728
All right.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.521
Excuse me.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.944
Stop staring at me!

17:57.952 --> 18:00.120
Why do they keep

17:57.952 --> 18:00.120
doing that?

18:00.162 --> 18:02.040
You're new.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.040
Oh, great.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.542
So I'm the freak

18:02.081 --> 18:04.542
of the freak show?

18:04.584 --> 18:07.127
Just... chill out.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.128
Don't tell me

18:07.169 --> 18:08.128
to chill out.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.129
You chill out.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.007
Nobody can live

18:09.171 --> 18:11.007
like this.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.759
I'm okay.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.759
Oh, sure.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.803
You're okay because it doesn't

18:12.800 --> 18:15.803
make any difference to you.

18:15.845 --> 18:16.930
You've always been a freak.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.139
I  used to be normal.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.810
Wait. Who just

18:19.181 --> 18:22.810
said that?

18:22.852 --> 18:26.188
You're going to take that

18:22.852 --> 18:26.188
the wrong way, aren't you?

18:26.230 --> 18:28.524
You...

18:28.566 --> 18:31.069
suck.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.866
It's so cool!

18:38.284 --> 18:43.039
Around here, being smart is

18:38.284 --> 18:43.039
exactly like being radioactive.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.177
I can't believe I'm doing this.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.184
Stevie?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.520
What?

19:07.647 --> 19:08.481
Look,

19:08.522 --> 19:10.190
I...

19:11.400 --> 19:13.069
Score!

19:13.111 --> 19:14.988
(laughter)

19:15.029 --> 19:16.196
Hey, Spath!

19:16.238 --> 19:18.574
Why don't you stop

19:16.238 --> 19:18.574
being such a butt-wipe?!

19:18.616 --> 19:20.660
ALL:

19:18.616 --> 19:20.660
Ooh.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.998
What'd you call me?

19:25.039 --> 19:25.999
You heard me!

19:26.040 --> 19:27.125
I don't care anymore!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.127
I just don't care,

19:27.166 --> 19:29.127
Spath, okay?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.920
Alls you ever do is make

19:29.168 --> 19:30.920
everybody miserable!

19:30.962 --> 19:33.089
Except for your little

19:30.962 --> 19:33.089
monkey-slaves over there.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.590
Who, by the way,

19:34.632 --> 19:35.800
only pretend to like you.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.885
They hate you as much

19:35.842 --> 19:37.885
as everyone else does!

19:37.927 --> 19:39.720
And you're just too busy

19:37.927 --> 19:39.720
being mean and stupid

19:39.762 --> 19:41.221
to ever figure it out!

19:41.263 --> 19:44.224
I keep trying to run,

19:41.263 --> 19:44.224
but my legs won't work.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.811
Mom was right,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.811
they are important.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.938
Wow.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.439
I don't know about you,

19:50.481 --> 19:53.233
but the Krelboyne

19:50.481 --> 19:53.233
really hurt my feelings.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.444
(nervous laughter)

19:57.196 --> 19:58.405
Hey...

19:58.447 --> 20:01.117
Go away, Stevie.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.869
It's good you

20:01.159 --> 20:02.869
two are friends.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.329
He won't mind sharing

20:02.910 --> 20:05.329
his wheelchair.

20:05.371 --> 20:09.125
Okay, this is where something

20:05.371 --> 20:09.125
good happens, finally.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.417
So we're going to slow down

20:10.459 --> 20:13.462
and make it last

20:10.459 --> 20:13.462
as long as possible.

(gasping, shouting)

20:57.215 --> 20:59.299
I didn't mean to...

20:57.215 --> 20:59.299
I wasn't trying...

20:59.341 --> 21:01.301
Stevie, I'm sorry!

21:01.343 --> 21:03.804
(Stevie groaning)

21:03.846 --> 21:06.515
Ow...

21:06.557 --> 21:09.560
Aah...

21:09.602 --> 21:11.020
Ow!

21:11.062 --> 21:12.688
What's your problem?

21:12.730 --> 21:15.315
I mean, he's in a wheelchair

21:12.730 --> 21:15.315
and  he has glasses.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.152
Do you know how

21:15.357 --> 21:18.152
bad that looks?

So then, the principal comes out

21:30.372 --> 21:32.374
and everyone's all

21:30.372 --> 21:32.374
talking at once.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.626
So the story he puts together

21:33.667 --> 21:35.753
is that Spath attacks Stevie

21:33.667 --> 21:35.753
for his lunch,

21:35.795 --> 21:38.965
and I'm like this hero

21:35.795 --> 21:38.965
that stepped in to defend him.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.800
It was beautiful.

21:40.841 --> 21:44.262
Okay, it wasn't funny

21:40.841 --> 21:44.262
when Spath started crying.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.556
No, wait, it was.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.269
Dad's hair... ugh.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.521
Yeah, I know. It's gross.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.440
But, hey, if a bunch of birds

21:56.482 --> 21:58.151
can make the best

21:56.482 --> 21:58.151
out of what they get,

21:58.192 --> 21:59.860
then so can I.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.860
DEWEY:

21:58.192 --> 21:59.860
Malcolm?

21:59.902 --> 22:02.155
Like having to

21:59.902 --> 22:02.155
go to special

21:59.902 --> 22:02.155
class.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.990
I can make it

22:02.196 --> 22:03.990
work out,

22:02.196 --> 22:03.990
right?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.241
Malcolm?

22:05.283 --> 22:06.784
Not now!

22:06.826 --> 22:08.035
Or my

22:06.826 --> 22:08.035
family.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.996
We're not

22:08.077 --> 22:09.996
the greatest

22:08.077 --> 22:09.996
family in

22:08.077 --> 22:09.996
the world,

22:10.037 --> 22:11.371
but we can get

22:10.037 --> 22:11.371
better.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.873
I mean, it's

22:11.413 --> 22:12.873
not

22:11.413 --> 22:12.873
impossible.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.250
Malcolm?

22:12.915 --> 22:14.250
(knocking)

22:14.292 --> 22:15.293
What?!

22:15.334 --> 22:16.543
Can I get out?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.045
No! Stop asking!

22:18.087 --> 22:21.757
So, basically, I

22:18.087 --> 22:21.757
think

22:18.087 --> 22:21.757
everything's

22:18.087 --> 22:21.757
going to be okay.

22:21.799 --> 22:22.466
(knocking)

22:22.508 --> 22:24.468
A bug went up my nose.

22:25.636 --> 22:26.637
So what do

22:25.636 --> 22:26.637
you want me

22:25.636 --> 22:26.637
to do about

22:25.636 --> 22:26.637
it?
