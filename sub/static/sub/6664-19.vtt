00:00.100 --> 00:01.133
Adult adam:
<i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.135 --> 00:02.568
<i> This is what we did</i>
<i> after school...</i>

00:02.570 --> 00:05.337
<i> We'd prepare a feast</i>
<i> of our favorite sugary snacks</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:08.240
<i> In preparation</i>
<i> for an endless tv marathon.</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:11.910
<i> In those days,</i>
<i> our parents didn't pack our</i>
<i> schedules to keep us occupied.</i>

00:11.912 --> 00:15.547
<i> That honor went to whatever</i>
<i> the three networks chose</i>

00:15.549 --> 00:16.882
<i> To randomly broadcast,</i>

00:16.884 --> 00:19.952
<i> And it was glorious.</i>

00:20.220 --> 00:22.855
Hey! I was watching that!
I know.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.024
Then why'd you change it?
'cause I don't care.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.925
I thought that was clear
by now.

00:26.927 --> 00:27.359
Dude.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.095
It's like you have
no respect for me at all.

00:30.097 --> 00:30.796
It is like that, yes.

00:30.798 --> 00:34.199
I demand your respect!
Give it to me right now!

00:34.201 --> 00:36.502
Respect isn't given.
It's earned.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.403
You never get off
your lazy butt.

00:37.405 --> 00:41.774
When I was your age,
I went to school
and I had two jobs.

00:41.776 --> 00:42.508
Oh, yeah?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.743
I'll go out right now
and get an awesome job,

00:44.745 --> 00:46.311
And then you'll have
to respect me.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.882
And I'll learn
responsibility and earn
my own money

00:49.884 --> 00:51.216
And never depend on you
for anything.

00:51.218 --> 00:55.287
You're threatening me
with things I want you to do!

00:55.289 --> 00:57.289
This is on you.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.057
No, no, no. Stop.

00:58.059 --> 01:01.260
Come back here
and be a weight on
my spirit.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.194
Adult adam: <i> Unlike barry,</i>

01:02.196 --> 01:05.030
<i> My sister worked her</i>
<i> way up to assistant manager</i>
<i> at gimbels.</i>

01:05.032 --> 01:08.000
Erica, you really have
a flair for style.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.501
Your bandana work
is flawless.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.769
Thank you.
(chuckles)

01:10.771 --> 01:12.938
Aah! What the...
Stop it!

01:12.940 --> 01:16.041
Hey! It's me!
Barry!

01:16.142 --> 01:18.377
I told you to never
come where I am.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.011
Awesome news...

01:19.013 --> 01:21.046
You're getting me a job
so dad can respect me.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.882
(chuckling)
oh, good luck with that.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.184
I've been working
my whole life,

01:25.186 --> 01:26.485
And he still calls me
"the girl one."

01:26.487 --> 01:29.988
Erica, if your brother is
half as good as you,
he's hired.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.891
Chuck, I think if
you'll give my brother
a quick interview,

01:32.893 --> 01:34.393
You'll have all the info
you need.

01:34.395 --> 01:37.262
So, tell me...
What's your greatest strength?

01:37.264 --> 01:38.797
Easy... Bo staff.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.399
No! Wait.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.734
Busting fresh rhymes.
No! Wait.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.870
Handsome.
No! Wait.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.273
I was literally
born without fear.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.909
I'll let you know.

01:50.911 --> 01:51.777
Boom!
He'll let me know.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.013
Adult adam: <i> He didn't,</i>
<i> but barry refused</i>
<i> to quit looking.</i>

01:55.015 --> 01:56.148
My biggest weakness?

01:56.150 --> 01:58.150
I'm honest,
and I'm lazy.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.384
What's your
biggest weakness?

01:59.386 --> 02:02.588
Who do I think would win
a fight between a tiger
and a bear?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.623
(chuckles)
that's a good question.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.426
One you didn't ask,
but I'll discuss.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.128
Minimum wage?

02:09.130 --> 02:10.162
No, no, no.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.197
What's maximum wage?

02:12.199 --> 02:14.199
(chair squeaks)

02:15.034 --> 02:16.235
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:16.237 --> 02:20.239
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:22.575 --> 02:23.509
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:23.511 --> 02:27.246
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:27.248 --> 02:29.448
Adult adam:
<i> It was April 15,</i>
<i> 1980 something,</i>

02:29.450 --> 02:33.452
<i> And my mom's day was about</i>
<i> to be rocked to its very core.</i>

02:33.454 --> 02:34.786
Boopie, what's this?

02:34.788 --> 02:35.888
Spanish test.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.356
Beverly: "f"? As in "fail"?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.892
No, no. That's literally
humanly impossible.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.393
My children don't fail.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.427
I'm as stunned
as you are.

02:42.429 --> 02:46.765
Maybe it means "f" as in
"fabulous" or "first prize."

02:46.767 --> 02:49.902
I knew you would say that,
so I asked.

02:49.904 --> 02:50.369
It's "fail."

02:50.371 --> 02:54.106
My teacher said maybe
I'm better off moving
down a level.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.641
As in remedial?

02:55.643 --> 02:57.776
Oh-ho, no!
Are you mad?

02:57.778 --> 03:00.012
Yes, I'm mad...
At your teacher!

03:00.014 --> 03:02.314
<i> Senora</i> taraborelli?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.216
You think
this is her fault?

03:04.218 --> 03:05.817
Well, it's certainly not
your fault.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.085
You're just a little boy.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.288
That's true.
I am a little boy.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.890
A genius little boy.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.292
Please... Be nice.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.727
She's a lovely
but fragile woman.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.396
Well,
I'm lovely and pissed.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.065
Okay. I got to stop you
before this gets nuts.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.202
Clearly, this is the
one subject the kid
struggles in.

03:23.204 --> 03:26.638
You can't blame the teacher.
It's the boy.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.208
It takes
a very special educator

03:29.210 --> 03:31.343
To teach such a strange,
exotic language,

03:31.345 --> 03:33.812
With all the squiggles
over the letters

03:33.814 --> 03:36.515
And the crazy
upside-down question marks

03:36.517 --> 03:37.316
And the "rrrrrrrrrrr"s.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.484
Adult adam: <i> That right there</i>
<i> is what you call</i>

03:39.486 --> 03:41.053
<i> Beverly goldberg mom logic.</i>

03:41.055 --> 03:43.789
What do you mean
he failed drivers ed?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.691
<i> Yep, my mom could explain</i>
<i> away our failures</i>

03:45.693 --> 03:49.094
<i> By perfectly placing</i>
<i> the blame on anyone</i>
<i> but us.</i>

03:49.096 --> 03:51.196
You've got your own pedal
in there.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.898
I think you slammed on
the brakes yourself

03:52.900 --> 03:55.167
And sabotaged my son.
Change the grade.

03:55.169 --> 03:57.436
Change the grade.
Change the grade.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.670
Change the grade.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.439
Change the grade.
Change the grade.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.274
Change the...
Oh, that's nice.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.876
Adult adam:
<i> My mom would now</i>
<i> apply mom logic</i>

04:04.878 --> 04:06.011
<i> To why I sucked at spanish.</i>

04:06.013 --> 04:08.680
Look, adam is so smart,
and he tries so hard,

04:08.682 --> 04:12.851
But, you know,
he just can't keep up
with the other kids.

04:12.853 --> 04:13.785
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

04:13.787 --> 04:17.756
Uh, I see the situation
slightly differently.

04:17.758 --> 04:18.724
How's that?

04:18.726 --> 04:21.026
I see it
as entirely your fault.

04:21.028 --> 04:21.827
Oh... Mrs. Goldberg,

04:21.829 --> 04:25.464
I have been teaching spanish
for well over a decade.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.835
And have you adequately
kept up with changes
to the language?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.903
I'm... I'm pretty sure
it's set in stone.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.640
Mmm-hmm. Have you ever
even traveled

04:34.642 --> 04:36.375
To any of these
spanish places?

04:36.377 --> 04:39.745
No, not on a teacher's salary,
but look, I'm saving money,

04:39.747 --> 04:45.284
And I intend to
find myself in san juan,
drinking cervezas

04:45.286 --> 04:48.687
With a very fiery
caribbean lover

04:48.689 --> 04:51.223
Who will take me
in his taut, muscular arms,

04:51.225 --> 04:55.027
And together, we will dance
the forbidden dance.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.361
The lambada.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.029
Wow.

04:57.031 --> 05:00.165
That is...
Very graphic.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.401
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Look, I just...

05:02.403 --> 05:05.737
You know,
if adam is struggling,
I suggest you find a tutor.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.372
Excellent.
When can you start?

05:07.374 --> 05:09.341
Me? (chuckling) no, no.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.443
That would be
a conflict of interest.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.844
Oh, it's really not.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.079
I mean, the school
pays you to teach.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.081
Why can't I pay you more
to teach him more?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.850
In this case,
50 bucks an hour

05:18.852 --> 05:20.919
To help fund
your sensual adventure?

05:20.921 --> 05:22.354
Well,
that is very generous,

05:22.356 --> 05:24.656
But I would not feel
right about...

05:24.658 --> 05:26.458
Did you say $50?

05:28.227 --> 05:30.929
Adult adam: <i> Yep, mom logic</i>
<i> even managed to win over</i>

05:30.931 --> 05:33.432
<i> My earnest,</i>
<i> buttoned-up teacher.</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:35.033
The lure of the forbidden
dance is calling you.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.870
Adult adam: <i> Well, that</i>
<i> and the promise of a sensual,</i>
<i> silk-shirted</i> senor.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.273
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> my brother had somehow landed</i>

05:41.275 --> 05:42.107
<i> His very first job.</i>

05:42.109 --> 05:45.644
...And the in-depth
pizza-box-folding tutorial.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.913
So, any questions?

05:47.915 --> 05:49.715
Nope. I'm good.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.248
Are you?

05:50.250 --> 05:53.552
This entire operation rests
on you delivering our food

05:53.554 --> 05:54.753
Hot and on time.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.921
Don't you worry.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.222
Every street in this city

05:57.224 --> 05:59.825
Can tell you a story
about barry goldberg.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.761
Some are pretty hard
to talk about.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.663
Lot of bad memories.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.597
I, uh,
I struggle with stuff.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.467
Point is,
I know the streets good.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.368
Hope so.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.736
'cause this may be
the pizza depot,

06:10.738 --> 06:13.205
But we're closing in fast
on the big boys over
at domino's.

06:13.207 --> 06:17.142
See, they've tipped
their hand and revealed
the secret

06:17.144 --> 06:19.444
To the pizza-delivery
gold standard,

06:19.446 --> 06:22.881
And that's the avoidance
of this man.

06:23.349 --> 06:23.782
The noid.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.586
Oh, yeah.
The funny guy from
the commercials.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.453
Funny?

06:28.455 --> 06:31.923
This floppy-eared goblin
is a physical manifestation

06:31.925 --> 06:32.691
Of the challenges inherent

06:32.693 --> 06:36.461
In getting a hot pizza
delivered on time.

06:36.463 --> 06:39.498
The noid is evil,
and he never sleeps.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.334
He makes pizza cold.
I'm familiar with the noid.

06:42.336 --> 06:42.934
Are you?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.970
'cause he's the wolf
at the gates
who will stop at nothing

06:44.972 --> 06:48.340
Until he destroys us
and everything we hold dear.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.308
Are you afraid now?
Huh?

06:50.310 --> 06:51.309
No.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.144
He's a cartoon.

06:52.146 --> 06:53.745
You're cocky, rookie.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.380
I like that.

06:57.216 --> 06:58.550
Oh! Look at you!

06:58.552 --> 07:01.586
How was the first day
on the job?
Not bad at all.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.255
Made a ton of dough.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.022
Pizza dough.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.390
It's a joke we say
around the shop,

07:05.392 --> 07:07.993
Because "dough" is
another word for "money"

07:07.995 --> 07:09.127
But we also cook
with it.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.463
I got to admit,
I didn't think you'd
go through with it.

07:11.465 --> 07:16.334
But hard work like this
deserves something special.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.403
What's this?

07:18.405 --> 07:19.271
Bottle of suds.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.840
It's about time you had
a beer with your old man.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.074
What the hell
is this?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.343
Uh, just a little
father-son thing.

07:25.345 --> 07:28.046
Dad's giving me a beer
'cause I'm a working man.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.149
What? I work,
and I like beer.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.553
I've said too much.
I should go.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.456
Just to be clear,
this is a one-time thing.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.591
I can't believe
this is happening.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.125
Oh, believe it.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.161
This frosty cold one
is a rite of passage,

07:43.163 --> 07:45.564
A symbol of my respect.

07:45.566 --> 07:49.100
Son, you are
no longer a moron.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.469
You are a man.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.971
This is too much.
I'm freaking out.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.705
Don't freak out.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.407
I'm freaking out!
Don't freak out.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.375
(grunts)
(glass shatters)

07:57.377 --> 07:58.376
The hell was that?

07:58.378 --> 08:00.312
I panicked!
I didn't know what to do!

08:00.314 --> 08:03.448
You drink it!
You don't slap it
across the room!

08:03.450 --> 08:05.217
I know that now!

08:05.219 --> 08:06.151
Let's just
put a pin in this.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.887
Adult adam:
<i> While barry was struggling</i>
<i> with his newfound respect,</i>

08:08.889 --> 08:10.322
<i> I was hoping my new tutor</i>

08:10.324 --> 08:12.991
<i> Would end my struggles</i>
<i> with</i> el espanol.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.260
<i> Gracias,</i> dave kim.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.229
Ah, paco.
How'd we do?

08:17.231 --> 08:18.797
Um... <i> No buena.</i>

08:18.799 --> 08:21.533
No? Oh, I'm sure
it's not that bad.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.069
(sighing) oh, boy.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.804
Whew. Okay.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.705
Uh...

08:26.707 --> 08:28.907
Why don't you go ahead
and just, uh,

08:28.909 --> 08:32.010
Eh, take another look
at 3.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.678
And 6.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.213
And 11.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.314
Really?

08:36.316 --> 08:37.816
Wow. Great.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.084
(chuckles)

08:39.086 --> 08:40.552
Um...

08:43.389 --> 08:45.290
<i> Me puedes...</i>

08:47.860 --> 08:49.594
<i> ...Pasar</i>

08:49.795 --> 08:51.696
<i> Los zapatos?</i>

08:51.998 --> 08:53.031
Oh, yeah.
You taught me that.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.399
See?
I knew you knew it.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.668
Well, thanks.
Ah, yeah.

08:56.769 --> 08:57.669
<i> Adios.</i>

08:57.671 --> 08:59.771
Oh. Oh, very good.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.745
Beverly: Squishy!

09:06.747 --> 09:08.613
I knew you could do it!

09:08.615 --> 09:09.848
Congrats, kid.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.384
Let's hear a little bit
of the old <i> espanol.</i>

09:12.386 --> 09:16.555
Well, I'm not quite ready
to talk and stuff.

09:16.557 --> 09:21.927
Me and my tutor/teacher
work mostly in english.

09:21.929 --> 09:22.561
Really?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.429
Yeah, she's got
this amazing technique

09:24.431 --> 09:27.332
Where even if I don't know
I know the answer,

09:27.334 --> 09:31.870
She reminds me I do know it
by telling it to me.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.104
Yay!

09:33.106 --> 09:35.473
My baby's learning.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.909
Little <i> senor.</i>

09:37.911 --> 09:39.778
You see what's going on,
right?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.112
You mean the way
his little face

09:41.114 --> 09:42.581
Gets more delicious
the more you look at it?

09:42.583 --> 09:47.419
I mean this teacher
clearly gave him the answers
'cause you paid her.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.888
Oh, poop.
She did not.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.122
That would be cheating.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.257
Yes, it is cheating.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.659
No, it is tutoring,
during the test.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.628
It's a totally different
thing.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.464
For once,
stop with the mom logic.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.332
That's not a thing.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.500
Oh, it is.
It's how you sleep at night

10:02.502 --> 10:04.102
Even though you know
he's learned nothing.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.707
But he thinks he's learning,
and thinking is learning.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.308
Again, mom logic.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.744
If cheating's the only way
adam can do well,

10:12.746 --> 10:17.949
Just do him a favor
and drop him down
to remedial.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.186
(bleep) ...That.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.054
Adam can learn
six languages,

10:23.056 --> 10:27.325
Because he is perfect
and anything but remedial!

10:29.762 --> 10:31.062
Mom logic.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.532
Adult adam:
<i> After a half day of rigorous</i>
<i> training at the pizza depot,</i>

10:34.534 --> 10:38.803
<i> Barry was confident he'd crush</i>
<i> his first day of deliveries.</i>

10:38.805 --> 10:40.138
(tires squeal)

10:40.140 --> 10:42.173
<i> He did not.</i>

10:44.043 --> 10:45.644
Glen oaks?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.479
I need oak glen!

10:47.481 --> 10:48.380
Where am I?

10:48.382 --> 10:49.714
<i> Sadly, barry was in oak ridge.</i>

10:49.716 --> 10:52.283
<i> He was lost,</i>
<i> and this meant sheer panic.</i>

10:52.285 --> 10:55.186
<i> See, back then, our cars</i>
<i> didn't have navigation systems</i>

10:55.188 --> 10:56.521
<i> Or cellphones</i>
<i> with google maps.</i>

10:56.523 --> 11:02.260
<i> Barry's only choice</i>
<i> was to wrangle an actual map</i>
<i> and stress-eat.</i>

11:02.928 --> 11:03.928
Oh, no!

11:03.930 --> 11:06.131
I'm not paying
for this, bro.
Why?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.600
Well, first of all,
you're an hour
and a half late.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.235
And, secondly...

11:10.237 --> 11:12.337
You clearly
ate a piece.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.873
Dude,
you don't understand.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.143
If you don't pay me,
it comes out of my check.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.311
Oh.
I didn't realize that.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.913
Yeah.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.518
Uh...

11:26.752 --> 11:29.120
You're fired.
What? Why?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.422
'cause you're the noid.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.556
I am not the noid!

11:31.558 --> 11:33.658
You have successfully
delivered four pizzas.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.726
You know it.
Out of 37.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.729
Please don't fire me.
Just take the mistakes
out of my check.

11:37.731 --> 11:41.132
Oh, I did,
until there was
no check left.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.268
You now owe us $314.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.302
This is a job.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.304
You pay me.
I don't pay you.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.007
Yeah. That's how
it usually works.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.209
Yet here we are.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.412
Aah!

11:54.613 --> 11:57.482
A noid
knocking a noid down.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.149
How ironic.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.718
Adult adam: <i> As my brother was</i>
<i> losing his job,</i>

11:59.720 --> 12:03.421
<i> I was getting</i>
<i> a "b" in spanish,</i>
<i> and it felt awesome.</i>

12:03.423 --> 12:04.489
<i> Well, to me.</i>

12:04.491 --> 12:05.256
<i> Hola, friendos!</i>

12:05.258 --> 12:10.261
Who's ready
<i> por esloppy joses</i>
for <i> lunch-o,</i> eh?

12:10.263 --> 12:11.629
(chuckles)

12:11.631 --> 12:14.265
What's with
the silent treatment?
Are you guys mad at me?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.500
Adam, everyone knows
what's going on

12:15.502 --> 12:17.302
With you
and <i> senora</i> taraborelli.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.303
You mean my tutoring?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.972
Seems like
a little more than that.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.108
Dana. Babe, it's me.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.976
I would never
step out on you
like that.

12:24.978 --> 12:28.713
No one thinks
you're dating the
spanish teacher, dude.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.415
We study for hours
just to pass,

12:30.417 --> 12:32.951
While you get to cut
all the corners.

12:32.953 --> 12:33.885
Corners? No!

12:33.887 --> 12:35.653
I'm getting tutored,
and I'm excelling.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.589
Trust me, it's all
on the up-and-up.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.658
In fact, I bet
she'd tutor all of us.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.594
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.662
There has been
a huge misunderstanding.

12:44.664 --> 12:48.433
If it's the money,
I bet you my parents
will pay double.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.334
Oh. No. No.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.802
My family owns
a restaurant.

12:50.804 --> 12:54.906
Help me out,
and you could be ass-deep
in crab rangoon.

12:54.908 --> 12:55.707
Wha...

12:55.709 --> 12:58.276
Oops. Left my wallet there
on the desk.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.678
I'm gonna turn around
and count to three.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.413
If it turns up empty,
so be it.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.583
Dave kim knows
nothing in life is free.

13:06.585 --> 13:07.318
You can't quit!

13:07.320 --> 13:09.754
Things have gotten
completely out of hand.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.090
Dave sirota put a $10 bill
in my waistband

13:12.092 --> 13:14.325
And told me
to "think about it."

13:14.327 --> 13:16.194
Well,
what about san juan?

13:16.196 --> 13:17.529
The lambada!

13:17.531 --> 13:18.396
Who am I kidding?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.765
It's a forbidden dance!
I'm not allowed!

13:20.767 --> 13:22.634
Anyone can dance
that dance.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.470
Look, Monday, we're doing
our oral presentations.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.304
And if adam doesn't pass,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.807
He's being moved down
to remedial spanish.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.074
But we had a deal.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.242
Well, that deal is off.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.243
I'll just spend
another summer in ohio,

13:32.245 --> 13:35.814
Sleeping on the couch,
because mother's cat
has priority of the bed.

13:35.816 --> 13:40.752
Adult adam:
<i> While my disgruntled teacher</i>
<i> was shutting down my mom,</i>

13:40.754 --> 13:44.689
<i> Barry was keeping up</i>
<i> the illusion of still</i>
<i> having a job.</i>

13:44.691 --> 13:47.292
There he is!
Working man!

13:47.294 --> 13:48.760
How was your day?
Good.

13:48.762 --> 13:52.096
And I am definitely not
the noid.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.998
Well, I want to show you
something.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.735
(smacks lips)
the whole beer thing
didn't work out,

13:57.737 --> 13:58.403
Because you're a moron.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.773
But this, this here...
This is our moment.
Come here.

14:01.775 --> 14:06.711
<i> And just like that,</i>
<i> my father gave barry the</i>
<i> ultimate sign of respect...</i>

14:06.713 --> 14:08.479
<i> The la-z-boy.</i>

14:08.481 --> 14:10.381
I get my own chair?

14:10.383 --> 14:11.316
Yeah.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.585
And that's not all.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.788
And the remote?

14:16.790 --> 14:18.256
Last time
I touched this thing,

14:18.258 --> 14:19.891
You threw a photo cube
at my head.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.794
Well,
times have changed.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.430
You used to be this boy...

14:25.432 --> 14:27.165
And now you're this man.

14:27.167 --> 14:31.636
And that means
you get to choose
what we watch.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.371
(gasps)

14:34.106 --> 14:35.306
(sighs)

14:35.308 --> 14:36.441
(siren wails)

14:36.443 --> 14:38.343
(up-tempo music playing)

14:38.345 --> 14:40.979
And you chose
a grown man in tights.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.413
What the hell is this?

14:42.415 --> 14:45.016
First beer,
and now a chair?

14:45.018 --> 14:45.717
And the remote.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.652
Last time
I touched that thing,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.320
You threw a photo cube
at my head.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.923
Well, it's different for me
'cause I'm a working man.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.692
Hello? I've been working
my whole life!

14:54.694 --> 14:56.961
This is
a total double standard.

14:56.963 --> 14:57.595
No, it's not.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.863
Dad's just giving me
special treatment

14:58.865 --> 15:00.632
'cause I'm a boy
and you're not,
so you lose.

15:00.634 --> 15:05.703
That's the definition
of a double standard,
you idiot!

15:05.804 --> 15:06.437
Seriously?

15:06.439 --> 15:09.540
Erica: And why do you keep
watching that?
It's so weird!

15:09.542 --> 15:12.143
I wish I could
move my hips like that.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.578
Adult adam:
<i> Erica refused to sit back</i>

15:13.580 --> 15:16.414
<i> And let barry rub</i>
<i> his newfound respect</i>
<i> in her face,</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:20.151
<i> So she went to his job</i>
<i> to let him have it.</i>

15:20.452 --> 15:22.487
I told you,
you can't sit here
all day!

15:22.489 --> 15:23.688
Just give me
one more chance.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.057
No, no, no.
You don't work
here anymore!

15:26.059 --> 15:27.292
Now beat it, noid!

15:27.294 --> 15:27.859
(horn honking)

15:27.861 --> 15:31.329
Adult adam:
<i> Fortunately for her,</i>
<i> there was no job.</i>

15:31.331 --> 15:32.597
Don't you worry,
schmoo.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.732
Your teacher may have
failed you,
but not your mama.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.937
I will see to it
that you ace that
oral presentation.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.805
You're even worse
at spanish than I am.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.775
It's hopeless. I should
just go down to remedial.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.577
A presentation has
nothing to do with knowledge.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.345
It's all about flash.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.348
I'm pretty sure
it's all about
spanish words.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.784
Oh, no.
It's about showmanship.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.886
You're a natural performer,
and with my help,

15:54.888 --> 15:59.023
You will dazzle them
with your talent,
grace, and dignity.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.592
Adult adam: <i> That's right...</i>
<i> Beverly goldberg's mom logic</i>

16:01.594 --> 16:04.262
<i> Convinced me that</i>
<i> I could pass a spanish test</i>

16:04.264 --> 16:06.698
<i> Without the use</i>
<i> of actual spanish.</i>

16:06.700 --> 16:10.168
<i> Me gusto mucho</i>
<i> "pet cementerio."</i>

16:10.170 --> 16:13.404
(chuckles)
<i> muy bueno,</i> dave kim.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.939
(chuckling) okay.

16:14.941 --> 16:15.807
(applause)

16:15.809 --> 16:20.545
<i> Y finalmente...</i>
<i> Senor goldberg.</i>

16:20.547 --> 16:22.947
Adult adam:
<i> This was it... Go time.</i>

16:22.949 --> 16:25.083
<i> With the help</i>
<i> of my trusty assistant,</i>

16:25.085 --> 16:27.719
<i> An exotic musical score</i>
<i> from faraway lands,</i>

16:27.721 --> 16:31.823
<i> And one he-man pinata,</i>
<i> I would ace my spanish class.</i>

16:31.825 --> 16:33.358
<i> (la bamba</i> plays)

16:33.360 --> 16:34.692
Maracas!

16:34.694 --> 16:36.694
Guacamole!

16:37.363 --> 16:37.795
<i> Ole!</i>

16:37.797 --> 16:41.799
Adult adam:
<i> By today's standards,</i>
<i> the content was questionable.</i>

16:41.801 --> 16:43.668
Salsa! Salsa!

16:43.670 --> 16:44.168
Salsa?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.670
Adult adam:
<i> And sure, I borrowed heavily</i>

16:45.672 --> 16:48.172
<i> From the stereotypes</i>
<i> I saw in the movies.</i>

16:48.174 --> 16:49.007
<i> The three amigos.</i>

16:49.009 --> 16:51.576
Adult adam:
<i> Man, did I kill it.</i>

16:52.044 --> 16:53.878
Wow. Well,
what a wonderful summary

16:53.880 --> 16:56.581
Of a very beautiful
and vibrant culture.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.148
(chuckling) okay.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.617
But you didn't answer
the question.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.986
(speaking in spanish)

17:02.988 --> 17:05.623
(speaking in spanish)

17:05.625 --> 17:08.593
Adult adam:
<i> For once, beverly goldberg</i>
<i> had no mom logic</i>

17:08.595 --> 17:12.497
<i> To cover up the fact</i>
<i> that I was a literal failure.</i>

17:13.465 --> 17:14.399
<i> Erica knew barry's secret</i>

17:14.401 --> 17:16.034
<i> And how it would crush him</i>
<i> if my dad found out,</i>

17:16.036 --> 17:20.138
<i> Which is exactly why</i>
<i> she made sure that</i>
<i> was gonna happen.</i>

17:20.140 --> 17:20.872
(doorbell rings)

17:20.874 --> 17:23.408
That's me.
I ordered pizza.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.842
(gasps) yes!

17:24.844 --> 17:26.878
Pizza! Pizza!

17:27.079 --> 17:29.580
Oh, crap.
Pizza.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.150
That'll be $314.
What?

17:32.152 --> 17:35.019
Erica? How many toppings
did you order?

17:35.021 --> 17:39.090
None. You owe him money
because you lost 33 pizzas.

17:39.092 --> 17:42.226
Who gets a job
and ends up owing
them money?

17:42.228 --> 17:42.560
Me!

17:42.562 --> 17:47.498
I'm sorry.
I finally had your respect,
and I got fired in two days.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.068
Eh, don't beat
yourself up.

17:50.070 --> 17:50.735
Wait... What, now?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.371
Eh, he's going through
a rough patch.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.739
Did I ever tell you
about the time

17:54.741 --> 17:57.742
That I got fired from
the deli for refusing
to wear a hairnet?

17:57.744 --> 18:02.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you actually bonding
with him over getting fired?

18:02.982 --> 18:03.948
What is wrong with you?

18:03.950 --> 18:08.653
I've babysat, I've tutored,
I've sold hot dogs on sticks

18:08.655 --> 18:10.455
And oranged
thousands of juliuses.

18:10.457 --> 18:15.793
And in all that time,
you never showed me
a shred of respect.

18:16.995 --> 18:17.528
Erica, wait!

18:17.530 --> 18:19.931
Adult adam:
<i> As my dad realized there</i>
<i> really was a double standard,</i>

18:19.933 --> 18:23.968
<i> My mom finally accepted</i>
<i> it was time to lower hers.</i>

18:23.970 --> 18:26.070
How's my little
pinto bean?
Don't.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.406
You used my love
of performance against me,

18:28.408 --> 18:30.374
And I completely
embarrassed myself.

18:30.376 --> 18:33.344
I know.
And I'm sorry.

18:33.579 --> 18:34.612
It's just that...

18:34.614 --> 18:37.415
I always see you
as my perfect little angel.

18:37.417 --> 18:41.886
And when the world
doesn't agree with me,
I go a little nuts.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.287
A little?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.589
Okay, a lot.

18:44.591 --> 18:48.159
Look, I realize
no one's perfect.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.361
God knows I'm not.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.396
But when it comes to you...

18:52.398 --> 18:54.899
I can never see you
any other way.

18:54.901 --> 18:59.871
Well, I guess that's
not the worst thing
in the world.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.008
Hey, mama?

19:04.877 --> 19:07.979
(speaking in spanish)

19:07.981 --> 19:11.115
I don't know what that means,
but it's beautiful.

19:11.117 --> 19:14.152
Adult adam:
<i> Sure, my family didn't always</i>
<i> speak the same language.</i>

19:14.154 --> 19:16.220
<i> Luckily,</i>
<i> I learned just enough spanish</i>

19:16.222 --> 19:18.122
<i> To tell my mom</i>
<i> how I really felt</i>

19:18.124 --> 19:21.459
<i> Without her</i>
<i> ever really knowing.</i>

19:24.329 --> 19:25.663
Go away.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.764
Not until we talk.

19:26.766 --> 19:27.965
What's there
to talk about?

19:27.967 --> 19:29.333
You've made everything
pretty clear.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.503
Look, even though
barry's a moron,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.305
He's a lot like me.

19:34.307 --> 19:34.939
I get him.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.808
And the reality is,
I was never a teenage girl.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.011
Well,
that's a relief to hear.

19:40.013 --> 19:40.678
What I mean is,

19:40.680 --> 19:44.482
I just wanted to have
the big rite of passage
with my son,

19:44.484 --> 19:47.785
When I should have been
having it with my daughter.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.523
(clears throat)

19:53.125 --> 19:56.127
Here's to you.
You're a man now.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.895
(chuckles)

19:58.030 --> 19:59.697
Thanks, dad.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.100
What the...
What is this?

20:03.102 --> 20:04.936
You are in big trouble,
missy!

20:04.938 --> 20:06.871
But dad just...
I caught her with these.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.639
Oh, my...
You are so grounded!

20:08.641 --> 20:11.676
You're lucky your dad
got here before me!

20:11.678 --> 20:12.944
So lucky!

20:12.946 --> 20:14.512
(mouthing)

20:14.514 --> 20:16.814
Adult adam:
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about growing up.</i>

20:16.816 --> 20:17.915
<i> Sometimes you take the fall</i>

20:17.917 --> 20:19.951
<i> Or you struggle</i>
<i> to make the grade.</i>

20:19.953 --> 20:22.954
Looks like the
remedial class is more
my speed.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.890
(gasps) you are so
going to harvard.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.159
I'm not, but sure.
(chuckles)

20:28.161 --> 20:30.094
I made dinner.

20:30.229 --> 20:30.962
Barry: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:30.964 --> 20:32.563
Adult adam: <i> And sure,</i>
<i> you may be far from perfect,</i>

20:32.565 --> 20:35.366
<i> But with your family close by,</i>
<i> life comes pretty darn close.</i>

20:35.368 --> 20:40.571
You know, I wish
you'd fight over
my salads like that.

20:41.807 --> 20:45.443
Me niego de contestar
esta pregunta.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.544
(bell ding)

20:46.546 --> 20:49.013
Esta clase
es tan aburrida.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.582
Muy bien, clase!

20:51.584 --> 20:52.516
Adios!

20:52.518 --> 20:53.951
Kid: Adios!

20:53.953 --> 20:57.321
How many years of experience
do I have as a cpa?

20:57.323 --> 21:01.192
(scoffs)
let me answer that
with a follow-up question.

21:01.194 --> 21:03.327
What is a cpa?

21:03.962 --> 21:06.430
This kid's head is weird.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.065
(sighs)

21:08.067 --> 21:08.666
Are you related?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.568
(rapping)
<i> ¶ I've got fresh rhymes</i>
<i> and I gotta pay my bills</i>

21:10.570 --> 21:13.738
<i> ¶ you've got a lot of grime</i>
<i> and I got some</i>
<i> cleaning skills ¶</i>

21:13.740 --> 21:17.975
Then I put the second
piece of tape this way,

21:17.977 --> 21:20.344
And I'm a pig!
(chuckles)

21:20.346 --> 21:21.412
(beat-boxing)

21:21.414 --> 21:22.913
Hire me.
