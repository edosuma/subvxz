WEBVTT

00:01.660 --> 00:02.388
-Where are you off to?

00:02.390 --> 00:03.379
-Nowhere.

00:03.380 --> 00:04.369
Be home for dinner.

00:08.020 --> 00:09.499
-Larrick is a monster.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.810
He is responsible for the death
of hundreds of my countrymen.

00:12.820 --> 00:15.141
-The operation and
Larrick are bigger

00:15.150 --> 00:16.594
than your wish for revenge.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.545
-We're taking the scientist.

00:18.550 --> 00:19.903
-P|ease don't send me back.

00:19.910 --> 00:20.751
Please.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.125
I'll put you on the ARPANET.

00:22.130 --> 00:23.813
This you don't have
in the Soviet Union.

00:23.820 --> 00:24.514
The ARPAN ET?

00:24.520 --> 00:25.623
The scientist mentioned that.

00:25.630 --> 00:27.939
What is it?

00:27.940 --> 00:29.555
It has to
do with computers.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.849
-What can you give me in
exchange for Nina's safety.

00:33.850 --> 00:36.159
What is it you want?

00:36.170 --> 00:42.314
The FBI surveillance
logs that pertain to me.

00:48.660 --> 00:54.280
-C|ark, There's-- there's still
one thing that's bothering me.

00:54.290 --> 00:55.814
-Mmhmm?

00:55.820 --> 00:57.970
-I mean, I'm so proud of the way
we got through the past couple

00:57.980 --> 01:02.815
of weeks and
everything is great,

01:02.820 --> 01:09.498
but, um, well, I really
like everyone at work.

01:09.510 --> 01:12.468
They're good people.

01:12.470 --> 01:15.223
I don't feel right about helping
your office with them anymore.

01:15.230 --> 01:17.653
-Why is that?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.469
-I know it's how
we met, and I know

01:19.480 --> 01:22.472
it's going to happen
with or without me,

01:22.480 --> 01:26.200
but now that we're
together, I don't

01:26.210 --> 01:27.108
think I should be involved.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.318
And I feel terrible that agent
guy layered because of me.

01:33.330 --> 01:35.537
-What?

01:35.540 --> 01:37.576
That wasn't because of you.

01:37.580 --> 01:39.389
-Whatever he did,
your office knows

01:39.400 --> 01:42.039
about it because of those tapes.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.213
-Martha, we've been over
this a million times.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.531
You can't put me
in a position where

01:48.540 --> 01:50.838
I have to choose between
my responsibility

01:50.840 --> 01:53.900
to our country and you.

01:53.910 --> 01:55.832
-OK, other people have
important jobs and wives.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.352
Doesn't always have
to be a choice, Clark.

02:07.590 --> 02:10.479
-Wow.

02:10.490 --> 02:12.469
-See how they changed the front?

02:12.470 --> 02:13.346
-What are the seats like?

02:13.350 --> 02:15.614
-I dunno.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.928
-Why aren't you in
the driver's seat?

02:16.930 --> 02:18.045
-Too many speeding tickets.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.688
- I'll bet.

02:19.690 --> 02:20.918
Rich Perkins, Chevrolet.

02:20.930 --> 02:24.161
-Phil Jennings, just looking.

02:24.170 --> 02:24.864
-Where you boys from?

02:24.870 --> 02:25.757
-Uh, here.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.658
Falls Church.

02:26.660 --> 02:30.061
-Well, it's a great area
to zip around in this

02:30.070 --> 02:32.686
-Is this really in the
pace to Indianapolis 500?

02:32.690 --> 02:33.600
-Hand on the Bible.

02:33.610 --> 02:36.078
-We're not in the
Indianapolis 500.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.038
-And that is the
beauty of the 228.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.043
Chevy wants you to have the same
experience as the professional.

02:42.050 --> 02:45.804
Why shouldn't you feel all that
speed and power and freedom?

02:45.810 --> 02:47.698
-"Road and Tracks" says it's
going to be car of the year.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.154
-And it will.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.253
But as your dad knows,
we can talk specs

02:51.260 --> 02:52.784
until you're blue in the face.

02:52.790 --> 02:57.272
But when you get down to it,
buying a car is about feel.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.304
How does it make you feel?

05:39.140 --> 05:43.088
-Whoa, what's this?

05:43.090 --> 05:45.069
-It's the Camaro 228.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.069
Dad just bought it.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.196
Isn't it awesome?

05:47.200 --> 05:47.894
-Ah-mazing.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.414
Well, at least it's not a plane.

07:36.550 --> 07:37.778
Oh, come on, guys.

07:37.780 --> 07:39.668
Martha's not so bad.

07:39.670 --> 07:40.898
I don't know, sir.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.242
Look, my first boss

07:42.250 --> 07:44.946
said I should hire an
ugly old lady so I'd

07:44.950 --> 07:47.566
have to be 10 scotches
deep before I'd touch her.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.891
You'd do an
ugly old lady with 10 scotches.

07:49.900 --> 07:50.969
Ugly old lady?

07:50.970 --> 07:51.664
Ew.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.150
I'd need 10 scotches
and a bag over her head.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.128
-All right, then.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.505
Martha's a good girl.

07:58.510 --> 08:00.330
Leave her alone.

08:00.340 --> 08:01.978
-So that's what
they actually said.

08:01.980 --> 08:06.144
But I'm not sure it's enough to
get her back on Clark's side,

08:06.150 --> 08:09.608
so this is how I fixed it.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.848
Oh, come on, guys.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.192
Martha's ugly.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.212
I'd have to be

08:14.220 --> 08:16.040
10 scotches deep
before I'd touch her.

08:16.050 --> 08:16.823
Ew.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.548
10 scotches and a
bag over her head.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.844
-So what do you think?

08:23.850 --> 08:27.013
I'm going to play it for
her tomorrow morning.

08:27.020 --> 08:27.952
-That'l| work.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.534
-What?

08:34.210 --> 08:35.154
What's wrong?

08:39.430 --> 08:40.180
Is it the car?

08:43.120 --> 08:46.908
-I just-- I-- I want
you to be happy.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.378
-Come on, Elizabeth.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.767
Don't you enjoy any of this?

08:58.770 --> 09:00.374
Sometimes?

09:00.380 --> 09:04.498
This house, your clothes,
all those beautiful shoes?

09:07.700 --> 09:11.716
It-- it doesn't make
you bad at what you do.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.415
Itjust makes you a human being.

09:16.780 --> 09:17.735
Don't you ever like it?

09:21.300 --> 09:23.803
-That's not like why I'm here.

09:23.810 --> 09:27.086
-But don't you ever like it?

09:27.090 --> 09:32.653
-We have to live this way
for our job, for our cover.

09:32.660 --> 09:35.299
Five miles from here, there
are people who are living--

09:35.310 --> 09:36.265
-Do you like it?

09:39.630 --> 09:42.406
-You know how I grew up.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.059
It's nicer here, yes.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.517
It's easier.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.373
It's not better.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.510
-Don't worry.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.760
It's not deadly.

10:49.210 --> 10:52.941
-Um, I just wanted to
remind you about tomorrow.

10:52.950 --> 10:53.644
-What?

10:53.650 --> 10:56.653
-My aunt's graduation
tomorrow night.

10:56.660 --> 10:57.354
-Right.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.213
-We talked about it.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.118
-I know.

11:01.830 --> 11:04.264
-OK, well I'll be home late.

11:04.270 --> 11:04.964
-No problem.

11:04.970 --> 11:08.758
I'll take care of dinner.

11:08.770 --> 11:09.464
-Great.

12:06.190 --> 12:06.884
-Hello?

12:23.770 --> 12:24.464
It's me.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.540
Forgot my keys.

12:26.550 --> 12:27.574
-Oh my gosh.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.287
Clark, what are you doing here?

12:30.290 --> 12:33.088
-I just found out I have
to fly to Atlanta tonight.

12:33.090 --> 12:35.229
I feel terrible because
It's one of our nights,

12:35.240 --> 12:37.231
so I came right over
because I thought maybe

12:37.240 --> 12:40.073
we could have
breakfast together.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.365
-You are sweet.

12:41.370 --> 12:42.064
I've got coffee on.

12:42.070 --> 12:42.764
-Oh.

12:42.770 --> 12:43.464
-Do you want toast?

12:43.470 --> 12:44.164
-Uh--

12:44.170 --> 12:47.128
-Actua|ly, you know, the
meatloaf for tonight is ready.

12:47.130 --> 12:50.725
I'll heat it up with eggs.

12:50.730 --> 12:53.449
-Actua|ly, um, there
is, uh, something

12:53.450 --> 12:56.305
that I do need to talk
to you about, Martha.

12:56.310 --> 12:57.004
-Ow.

12:57.010 --> 12:57.692
Oh.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.612
Oh, I cut myself.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.508
-Oh, honey.

13:02.510 --> 13:03.283
Oh, hold this.

13:03.290 --> 13:04.643
Hold this.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.379
Do you have a-- do
you have a bandaid?

13:06.380 --> 13:07.312
-Uh, right in there.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.858
-Uh, hold it under the water.

13:12.650 --> 13:13.332
-Ow.

13:26.750 --> 13:31.278
Clark, I'm sorry that I was
hassling you the other night.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.999
I know that your
work is stressful

13:34.000 --> 13:36.776
and that you're doing your best.

13:36.780 --> 13:40.546
Making all this extra effort,
I really appreciate it.

13:44.180 --> 13:45.249
So what did you want to tell me?

13:51.090 --> 13:58.587
-Well, you-- it's just-- you--
you everything around here,

13:58.590 --> 14:00.603
and I would like
to start to pitch

14:00.610 --> 14:04.205
in by picking up groceries.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.338
- Oh, Clark.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.285
Wow.

14:25.410 --> 14:27.480
-You know, my friends and I
used to play this in Gorlq Park.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.281
Had to wait in line for
hours just for one game.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.627
-Let me be perfectly clear.

14:38.630 --> 14:42.168
If I do this for you and then
somehow your people find out

14:42.170 --> 14:46.425
about her, I will hold
you responsible for that.

14:46.430 --> 14:48.227
Do you understand?

14:48.230 --> 14:51.222
-You're doing a
dangerous thing with her.

14:51.230 --> 14:55.109
I won't make promises
I can't keep.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.863
-Let me put it a different way.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.509
You're doing a dangerous thing.

15:01.510 --> 15:03.444
If you think you can get
what you want from me

15:03.450 --> 15:06.123
and then hurt her
or her family, I

15:06.130 --> 15:08.291
will probably figure that out.

15:08.300 --> 15:12.657
And then you'll feel
a whole lot different.

15:16.950 --> 15:21.501
-It's hard to think in
these circles to trust

15:21.510 --> 15:27.983
each other when,
really, we can't.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.662
We're falling into
something together.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.899
OK, I pushed us into
that, but I have

15:34.910 --> 15:36.707
no interest in
anyone getting hurt.

15:36.710 --> 15:43.286
Not you, me, her, some
grandmother of hers.

15:43.290 --> 15:43.984
Why would I?

15:48.740 --> 15:49.434
Do you have it?

16:04.260 --> 16:05.329
-We're not in anything together.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.350
-However you want to look at it.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.361
-I didn't ask for this.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.258
Notice we are at my house.

17:03.270 --> 17:03.964
-OK.

17:03.970 --> 17:05.369
-If your partner's out
there with a rifle,

17:05.370 --> 17:06.439
he doesn't have to worry.

17:09.740 --> 17:10.752
-We're always careful.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.840
-Apparently, your
comrade doesn't

17:20.850 --> 17:24.502
think I'm as important
to the cause as you do,

17:24.510 --> 17:26.933
so he was going to
torture me and kill me.

17:26.940 --> 17:27.736
-What did you do to her?

17:30.940 --> 17:33.909
-I didn't kill her,
that's what I did to her.

17:33.910 --> 17:35.844
I need to be done
with you people.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.078
My freedom for her life.

17:37.080 --> 17:37.830
That's my offer.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.245
-That's not out of
the question, but I'm

17:44.250 --> 17:45.990
going to need a few
things from you first.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.366
-You understand, I mean done.

17:48.370 --> 17:49.849
Forever.

17:52.240 --> 17:52.934
-Nina.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.059
I did it.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.335
-You gave him the reports?

18:03.340 --> 18:07.470
-I told you, I won't let
anything happen to you.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.062
-You think this
is the end of it?

18:10.070 --> 18:11.503
-It buys us time.

18:11.510 --> 18:13.125
-For what?

18:13.130 --> 18:16.497
For him to turn me
In later, or you?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.479
And it doesn't get more
when he asks again?

18:21.380 --> 18:23.484
We're destroying ourselves.

18:23.490 --> 18:26.823
It gets worse and
worse, whatever we do.

18:26.830 --> 18:30.163
Everything we do.

18:30.170 --> 18:33.105
There's no end.

18:33.110 --> 18:34.190
-We'|| figure it out.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.007
-How?

18:35.010 --> 18:35.863
Tell me how.

18:35.870 --> 18:38.111
-I'll find a way.

18:38.120 --> 18:38.961
We'll get out of this.

18:38.970 --> 18:40.346
We will get out.

18:51.020 --> 18:54.558
-If someone at the FBI
finds out what you have done

18:54.560 --> 18:59.850
to protect me, you
will go to prison.

18:59.860 --> 19:00.838
-They won't find out.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.144
What?

19:09.150 --> 19:10.128
What is it?

19:13.060 --> 19:17.008
-That you would do this for me.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.365
-I'll get you into the
Martial Eagle camp.

19:27.370 --> 19:30.498
I'll report from Nicaruaga
while I'm down there.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.706
Then I'm done.

19:31.710 --> 19:32.608
-Right.

19:32.610 --> 19:33.304
-For good.

19:33.310 --> 19:34.004
-Yes.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.991
-There's a password
for the camp.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.399
A hang signal, as well.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.503
-What are they?

19:41.510 --> 19:42.818
-I don't know.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.208
-Well, then you and
I have a problem.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.163
-They haven't been released yet.

19:50.170 --> 19:51.614
When I get them,
you'll have them.

19:54.160 --> 19:58.119
But if you break your
word, so help me,

19:58.130 --> 20:00.940
I'll kill every
Soviet ambassador

20:00.950 --> 20:03.839
in the Western hemisphere
before I'm done.

20:03.850 --> 20:05.272
-We won't break our word.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.579
You get us the signals, you send
us the reports from Nicaragua,

20:08.580 --> 20:09.763
you will never see us again.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.782
-Manolo Garcia.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.337
-Shut up, Lucia.

20:26.340 --> 20:29.241
-Miguel Salgado.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.194
Xavier Murido.

20:30.200 --> 20:30.939
-Stop.

20:30.950 --> 20:33.589
-My family.

20:33.590 --> 20:36.445
- No!

20:40.070 --> 20:40.980
-Kill him.

20:40.990 --> 20:41.684
Kill him.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.535
-Do you want to get
into the camp or not?

20:47.540 --> 20:49.258
It's either her or me.

20:49.260 --> 20:50.750
And she's not going to stop.

20:50.760 --> 20:54.218
You choose.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.350
-I'll get you the signals
before I leave for Nicaruaga.

21:55.530 --> 21:56.747
Get that body out of my house.

22:08.790 --> 22:13.693
-So I'm going after Oleg Burov,
head of SNT at the Rezidentura.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.008
They got the
scientist back alive.

22:15.010 --> 22:17.695
They must want whatever
project he's working on.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.144
I'm getting close, but
no matter what I do,

22:19.150 --> 22:22.335
I cannot get the DOD codeword
work and Steven look into it.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.705
-Did Hallowell try to work it?

22:23.710 --> 22:25.689
-Yeah, his position
is if DOD wants

22:25.700 --> 22:29.454
to get screwed by the KGB,
that's their prerogative.

22:29.460 --> 22:32.679
-Well, my current
position is I don't

22:32.690 --> 22:33.839
know what the hell else to do.

22:37.790 --> 22:38.893
-Maybe we kill Burov.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.258
-Is that a joke?

22:44.260 --> 22:46.797
-Wel, that would depend on
your sense of humour, sir.

22:52.640 --> 22:57.077
-Look, DOD's not gonna budge.

22:57.080 --> 23:00.334
Only thing I can think of,
you should put in a request

23:00.340 --> 23:01.967
straight to the
Department of Justice

23:01.970 --> 23:04.666
for codeword clearance
on the prOJect.

23:04.670 --> 23:06.194
-What do you think they'll say?

23:06.200 --> 23:07.360
-I have no idea.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.600
But as far as I can see,
that's your only chance.

23:12.190 --> 23:12.884
---mean.

23:12.890 --> 23:13.879
-It's not a word, dummy.

23:13.890 --> 23:15.369
Yeah, well, it should be.

23:15.380 --> 23:16.859
I agree, it should be.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.328
-Shh, shh.

26:33.790 --> 26:36.429
- I'm so sorry.

26:36.430 --> 26:37.738
-Hey, Bob.

26:37.740 --> 26:40.550
Hey, Christy.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.561
What's up?

26:41.570 --> 26:46.086
-Well, it seems Henry
broke into their house.

26:46.090 --> 26:46.840
-What?

26:46.850 --> 26:48.215
-To play a video game.

26:48.220 --> 26:49.084
-I didn't call the police.

26:49.090 --> 26:50.261
-He didn't take anything.

26:50.270 --> 26:50.964
-What?

26:50.970 --> 26:52.892
What do you mean, "broke in"?

26:52.900 --> 26:55.835
-I guess he knew where our
key was, let himself in.

26:59.190 --> 27:00.498
-That's crazy.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.831
-We know he's a good kid.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.798
-I-_- I _can't believe
this. I'm so sorry.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.516
-Kids.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.887
-Thank you for dealing
with this so generously.

27:08.890 --> 27:10.289
This will never happen again.

27:10.300 --> 27:10.994
We will talk to him.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.694
-We know.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.474
We just wanted to let you know.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.469
-OK.

27:14.470 --> 27:15.448
-C'mon, honey.

27:15.450 --> 27:16.439
-Good night.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.419
-Good night.

27:18.420 --> 27:19.409
-Good night, Christy.

27:26.470 --> 27:27.164
Unbelievable.

27:30.370 --> 27:31.940
Hey, hey, hey.

27:31.950 --> 27:32.644
-It's OK.

27:32.650 --> 27:33.344
It's OK.

27:33.350 --> 27:35.568
Kids do stuff.

27:35.580 --> 27:36.763
Look, he didn't take anything.

27:41.170 --> 27:42.637
-Larrick killed Lucia.

27:54.390 --> 27:55.186
-We will talk later.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.744
-She went after him.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.832
He trained the police
that tortured her father.

28:12.790 --> 28:13.768
-Let's go get him.

28:13.770 --> 28:15.704
I mean, we should've
done this a long time.

28:15.710 --> 28:16.404
-Philip--

28:16.410 --> 28:17.331
-No.
Forget about the camp.

28:17.340 --> 28:18.136
Forget about Nicaragua--

28:18.140 --> 28:20.586
-I was there.

28:20.590 --> 28:23.275
I let him.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.544
-What?

28:25.550 --> 28:28.394
-She didn't understand
what it is that we do.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.449
If she-- if she didn't
understand what comes ﬁrst,

28:31.460 --> 28:33.610
then she didn't
understand anything.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.497
It was for her goddamn country.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.899
-They shouldn't have sent her.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.209
--I'd already
worked it all out.

28:39.210 --> 28:41.087
Philip, I'd worked
it all out with him.

28:41.090 --> 28:42.216
-It's OK.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.676
It's OK.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.658
It's OK.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.878
It's OK.

28:46.890 --> 28:47.584
It's OK.

28:57.130 --> 28:58.563
No, it's
all about to break.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.923
He was the head of M15.

28:59.930 --> 29:02.467
And this guy's saying he spied
for the Soviets for years.

29:02.470 --> 29:03.676
You gonna string him up?

29:03.680 --> 29:04.385
-He's dead.

29:04.390 --> 29:05.982
Guy who wrote this story
might get strung up.

29:05.990 --> 29:06.706
Why?

29:06.710 --> 29:07.870
Because our
OffICIal Secrets

29:07.880 --> 29:10.098
Act lets them de-classify
almost everything.

29:10.100 --> 29:13.137
-I have a file
here from the DOJ.

29:13.140 --> 29:13.834
-That's me.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.042
-Look at this.

29:19.050 --> 29:22.224
People are leaving classified
files on top of your unsecured

29:22.230 --> 29:24.687
for it to take back
down to records.

29:24.690 --> 29:25.691
I've reported it twice.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.479
-Hangar in Virginia.

30:42.480 --> 30:46.940
Two companies are competing
to make invisible planes.

30:46.950 --> 30:48.565
-Invisible planes?

30:48.570 --> 30:51.949
-To a radar, yes.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.758
This is extremely important.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.239
-Isn't everything?

30:56.240 --> 30:57.764
-Well, yes, but.

31:02.090 --> 31:02.784
-What?

31:06.120 --> 31:08.566
-Something terrible happened.

31:08.570 --> 31:11.152
Uh, a submarine.

31:15.060 --> 31:16.596
-Just say it.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.625
-A submarine went down.

31:18.630 --> 31:19.881
The "Belomorsk."

31:19.890 --> 31:24.395
We lost 160 men, uh.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.278
A catastrophic propeller
malfunction of some kind.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.521
It spun out, ripped
through the hull.

31:29.530 --> 31:35.412
This was-- this was based
on the plans we stole.

31:39.020 --> 31:40.146
-I stole.

31:40.150 --> 31:41.879
_ -We have a source
In the AmerIcan Navy

31:41.890 --> 31:45.109
who now says the Americans
planted false plans at hundreds

31:45.120 --> 31:47.816
of places across the country.

31:47.820 --> 31:50.493
They knew we'd go after them.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.354
We picked up one
of the bad plans.

31:58.270 --> 32:02.218
-They-- they put up
plans for us to take

32:02.220 --> 32:03.255
that would sink a submarine.

32:06.010 --> 32:08.547
-Chairman Andropov's
furious, and

32:08.550 --> 32:12.008
everyone is beside themselves.

32:15.150 --> 32:18.961
The Centre feels Martial
Eagle comes at a perfect tIme.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.835
We can get expose
US forces secretly

32:20.840 --> 32:23.695
training Contra commanders
on American soil.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.622
Show the world
American hypocrisy,

32:25.630 --> 32:27.120
their bloodiness,
their willingness

32:27.130 --> 32:29.496
to topple democratic
governments,

32:29.500 --> 32:32.344
and make sure those Contra
field commanders die.

33:04.860 --> 33:06.088
-Wow.

33:06.090 --> 33:07.557
What'd you do, sell
one of the kids?

33:07.560 --> 33:08.254
- Yeah.

33:10.850 --> 33:12.169
-Nice.

33:12.180 --> 33:14.284
-Thanks.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.166
-You OK?

33:18.030 --> 33:18.724
-Oh, yeah.

33:18.730 --> 33:19.424
Yeah.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.113
I'm tired.

33:21.120 --> 33:21.870
-Busy, huh?

33:21.880 --> 33:22.574
-Yeah.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.274
Yeah.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.168
Business is booming.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.139
-Well, glad to
hear someone's is.

33:28.150 --> 33:30.960
-Work's not good?

33:30.970 --> 33:32.346
-It's too boring.

33:32.350 --> 33:34.159
You'd have to buy
me a lot of beers.

33:34.170 --> 33:36.024
I still wouldn't talk.

33:36.030 --> 33:37.054
I'll take the beers, though.

33:37.060 --> 33:39.654
-Well, then, let's find a night.

33:39.660 --> 33:40.809
-Definitely.

33:40.810 --> 33:41.595
Say hi to Elizabeth.

34:20.910 --> 34:21.638
- Goddammit!

34:44.390 --> 34:48.793
-The Soviet Union outspends
us on defence by 50%,

34:48.800 --> 34:53.100
an amount equal to 15% of
their gross national product.

34:53.110 --> 34:56.329
During the campaign, I was
asked any number of times,

34:56.340 --> 34:59.696
ifI were faced with a choice
of balancing the budget

34:59.700 --> 35:04.160
or restoring our national
defences, what would I do?

35:04.170 --> 35:07.298
Every time, I said
restore our defences,

35:07.310 --> 35:09.039
and every time I was applauded.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.532
-Larrick said the password
in the hand signal.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.174
-Good.

35:23.180 --> 35:25.205
Now we can kill him.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.199
-He's on a plane to Nicaragua.

35:29.650 --> 35:30.924
-We'|l kill him
when he comes back.

35:33.760 --> 35:34.875
-What did Kate want?

35:39.640 --> 35:42.689
-The propeller plans
that we stole were fake.

35:45.870 --> 35:47.303
-What?

35:47.310 --> 35:49.221
-The Americans planted them.

35:49.230 --> 35:52.222
We sank our own submarine.

35:52.230 --> 35:53.527
160 boys.

35:53.530 --> 35:55.282
- I
- have no inteition of leading

35:55.290 --> 35:58.635
the Republican Party into next
fall's election on a platform

35:58.640 --> 36:01.507
of higher taxes and
covering defence.

36:01.510 --> 36:03.899
-Look at him.

36:03.900 --> 36:04.844
He'll do anything.

36:04.850 --> 36:08.206
He doesn't care.

36:08.210 --> 36:09.529
Kids.

36:09.540 --> 36:10.825
Nuns.

36:10.830 --> 36:12.718
Journalists.

36:12.720 --> 36:13.618
He doesn't care.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.939
military and held

36:14.950 --> 36:16.531
a_fire sale on
natIonal securIty.

36:16.540 --> 36:19.885
Let's give them all the
running room they want.

36:34.190 --> 36:34.884
-I'm signing it now.

36:34.890 --> 36:35.686
I'm sending it over.

36:35.690 --> 36:36.816
You'll have it in
15 mInutes tops.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.809
Yes, sir.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.469
-Mary, courrier this
to the West Wing.

36:43.850 --> 36:45.112
You are the first
FBI agent who's

36:45.120 --> 36:47.736
ever asked to see me, Beeman.

36:47.740 --> 36:50.868
We have layers of management
to keep this from happening.

36:50.870 --> 36:52.371
-I know that, sir.

36:52.380 --> 36:54.007
They tried to manage me.

36:54.010 --> 36:54.704
-But?

36:57.820 --> 37:01.620
-I believe the KGB has
kidnapped a scientist

37:01.630 --> 37:04.463
to work on some kind
of project of theirs.

37:04.470 --> 37:06.620
I need the codeword
clearance to look into it.

37:06.630 --> 37:08.404
_-I know all about
It, Agent Beeman.

37:08.410 --> 37:11.891
I did, in fact, discuss
it with your supervisor,

37:11.900 --> 37:13.800
Agent Hallowell?

37:13.810 --> 37:16.278
The DOD handles
their own security

37:16.280 --> 37:19.534
for there top secret
military projects.

37:19.540 --> 37:20.393
Are they good at it?

37:20.400 --> 37:21.981
I have no idea.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.970
Probably not, given all
the shit the Soviet's have

37:24.980 --> 37:27.073
stolen, going back
to the atom bomb.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.731
But until the president puts
the Pentagon under the control

37:29.740 --> 37:32.095
of the Justice Department, I
can't do anything about it.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.624
-Can't you get me the
codeword clearance

37:33.630 --> 37:34.779
to get me into the project?

37:34.780 --> 37:35.860
-No.

37:35.870 --> 37:38.657
-Can't the president?

37:38.660 --> 37:41.572
You develop instincts,
sir, with all due respect.

37:41.580 --> 37:43.650
I can feel this about to happen.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.958
I can feel it happening now.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.428
The head of the Rezidentura's
Science and Technology

37:48.430 --> 37:51.843
Department is deeply
involved in this.

37:51.850 --> 37:55.946
I can stop him, but the goddamn
bureaucracy's killing us.

37:55.950 --> 38:02.139
-Beeman, I am the
goddamn bureaucracy.

38:02.140 --> 38:04.870
-That's why I'm here, sir.

38:09.890 --> 38:13.792
-Laundry's only once a week.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.758
-I thought Larrick
was going to be touch,

38:16.760 --> 38:22.244
but it looks like the_ best _
way under the camp Is septIc.

38:22.250 --> 38:23.012
It's good for the dogs.

38:23.020 --> 38:24.863
It throws off the scent
with the disinfectant.

38:28.150 --> 38:28.844
-Damn.

38:32.340 --> 38:33.329
-Over there.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.322
Sit.

38:39.330 --> 38:40.206
I said sit.

38:43.850 --> 38:45.408
We're going to take
the gag off now.

38:45.420 --> 38:47.809
If you scream or make any
trouble, we will kill you.

38:47.820 --> 38:50.288
If you answer our questions and
tell us what we need to know,

38:50.300 --> 38:50.994
you will be fine.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.366
Do you understand?

38:53.370 --> 38:54.450
Nod if you understand.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.011
-It's going to be OK, Lewis.

39:06.020 --> 39:08.375
All you have to do is answer
some quick, easy questions,

39:08.380 --> 39:10.917
and then we'll let you go
and nothing bad will happen.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.990
Do you understand?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.070
It is really
important that you nod

39:15.080 --> 39:18.527
so that we know you understand.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.703
OK.

39:20.710 --> 39:21.404
OK.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.717
-Which truck do you drive?

39:30.720 --> 39:32.335
-Which truck do
you drive, Lewis?

39:35.290 --> 39:38.965
-N-- number nine.

39:38.970 --> 39:41.632
-Where are the keys?

39:41.640 --> 39:42.868
-Inside the truck.

39:42.870 --> 39:45.202
-Where inside the truck?

39:45.210 --> 39:46.575
-Dashboard.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.616
-And when you go to the camp
tomorrow, Jefferson National

39:48.620 --> 39:51.225
Forest, does the guard there
ask you any unusual questions?

39:58.500 --> 39:59.842
Lewis, it is OK.

39:59.850 --> 40:01.602
We're almost done, and
then you can go home.

40:01.610 --> 40:02.872
I promise.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.700
Just look at me.

40:04.710 --> 40:06.189
You can do it.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.883
Lewis, just just look at me.

40:07.890 --> 40:09.221
There you go.

40:09.230 --> 40:12.028
Anything unusual you
and the guard discuss?

40:15.230 --> 40:18.563
When you get back in, when
you drive onto the camp,

40:18.570 --> 40:20.379
what-- it's OK.

40:20.390 --> 40:22.039
Lewis.

40:22.050 --> 40:25.417
Lewis, it is OK.

40:25.420 --> 40:28.162
When you drive onto the
camp, where do you park?

40:30.810 --> 40:33.449
-To the right of the
kitchen and the dumpster.

40:33.460 --> 40:34.813
-Great.

40:34.820 --> 40:37.072
Great.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.605
Just one last question.

40:39.610 --> 40:43.068
Who's your replacement
if you can't go in?

40:43.080 --> 40:43.808
It's OK.

40:43.810 --> 40:44.674
Lewis, it is OK.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.545
You can tell me because
nothIng WIll happen to hIm

40:46.550 --> 40:47.585
and nothing will happen to you.

40:47.590 --> 40:48.284
I promise.

40:48.290 --> 40:51.839
But we can't finish
untII you answer.

40:51.840 --> 40:56.254
Please, Lewis, for both your
sake's, what's his name?

40:56.260 --> 40:56.954
You can do it.

40:56.960 --> 41:00.077
I know you can do it.

41:00.080 --> 41:00.842
-Tom.

41:00.850 --> 41:01.566
-Bradick?

41:01.570 --> 41:02.264
-Is that him?

41:02.270 --> 41:04.226
Is that his name?

41:04.230 --> 41:06.186
Lewis, we have the names
of everyone you work with.

41:06.190 --> 41:07.270
Is that Him?

41:07.280 --> 41:09.009
Is it Tom Bradick?

41:09.020 --> 41:10.180
If not, just shake your head.

41:12.940 --> 41:13.634
Good.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.489
One last question.

41:20.490 --> 41:21.718
Has Tom ever been to the camp?

41:24.910 --> 41:26.684
-I never missed a day.

41:26.690 --> 41:28.578
-I bet.

41:28.590 --> 41:29.284
-I bet.

41:29.290 --> 41:29.847
Good.

41:29.850 --> 41:30.202
Great.

41:30.210 --> 41:30.972
You did a great job.

41:40.650 --> 41:44.165
-We can tie him up and gag him.

41:44.170 --> 41:45.023
-What if he gets loose?

41:45.030 --> 41:47.078
-He won't.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.559
-What if a hiker
comes by and they

41:48.560 --> 41:50.778
call the police when
we are in the camp?

41:50.780 --> 41:52.532
-No one hikes around here.

41:52.540 --> 41:53.234
-What if"

41:53.240 --> 41:56.186
-Yeah, what if an old lady
sees him or some schoolkids.

41:56.190 --> 41:56.929
Soldier, yes.

41:56.940 --> 41:58.794
This guy?

41:58.800 --> 42:00.165
We have a rope and
blanket in the car.

42:00.170 --> 42:01.808
We can pick him up
when we're done.

42:01.810 --> 42:02.504
-Philip.

45:49.320 --> 45:52.471
-All right, Henry.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.402
-You-- you don't
have to tell me.

45:54.410 --> 45:56.537
I know what you're going to say.

45:56.540 --> 45:59.168
It's not like I haven't been
thinking about it nonstop.

45:59.170 --> 46:01.411
I have.

46:01.420 --> 46:02.978
Makes me sick.

46:02.980 --> 46:07.542
Feel like I'm going to throw
up, but I didn't take anything.

46:07.550 --> 46:08.482
I wouldn't do that.

46:08.490 --> 46:11.618
And I didn't hurt anybody.

46:11.630 --> 46:13.427
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

46:13.430 --> 46:15.534
You know that, right?

46:15.540 --> 46:16.234
-I don't know, Henry.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.218
-But I do.

46:17.220 --> 46:17.914
I do.

46:17.920 --> 46:20.502
It just seemed like no
one would even know.

46:23.110 --> 46:28.082
And they weren't there,
you guys weren't here.

46:28.090 --> 46:30.672
Once I did it, it seemed
so easy to keep doing it.

46:35.560 --> 46:39.439
I-- I know it was wrong, but

46:39.440 --> 46:40.828
I'm not going to do it again.

46:40.830 --> 46:43.378
I feel horrible.

46:43.380 --> 46:46.099
But-- but they
think I'm some kind

46:46.110 --> 46:47.395
of criminal, which I'm not.

46:50.020 --> 46:52.932
I hate that they
think and I hate them.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.123
And I hate that you think it.

46:54.130 --> 46:55.040
It's not true.

46:55.050 --> 46:55.744
I'm not.

46:55.750 --> 46:56.694
I'm a good person.

46:56.700 --> 46:57.962
I swear.

46:57.970 --> 46:59.949
You know that.

46:59.950 --> 47:02.919
You know that.

47:02.920 --> 47:03.852
I'm good.

47:03.860 --> 47:06.704
Iam.

47:06.710 --> 47:09.452
I'm a good person, I swear.

47:09.460 --> 47:10.449
I'm good.

47:10.460 --> 47:11.950
I'm a good person.

47:11.960 --> 47:13.666
Iam.

47:13.670 --> 47:15.353
I swear I'm good.

47:15.360 --> 47:16.531
I'm not going to do it again.

47:23.440 --> 47:26.136
I swear.

47:26.140 --> 47:27.334
I'm good, I'm good.
