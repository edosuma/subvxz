29:28.245 --> 29:29.076
You can do it!

29:29.078 --> 29:30.661

29:31.595 --> 29:34.345
Come on, man, let's go, let's go.

29:35.373 --> 29:37.683
In the hole, in the hole.

29:37.685 --> 29:38.518
Yes!

29:40.394 --> 29:42.236
Get out of there, boy, get out of there!

29:42.238 --> 29:45.086
(SHRIEKS) That's what I'm talkin' about!

29:45.088 --> 29:48.030
We got some mail carriers
out here today, baby!

29:48.032 --> 29:50.199
(SCREAMS)

29:51.940 --> 29:53.690
Man, I don't think I can do this.

29:54.630 --> 29:56.231
There's water all over my face and shit.

29:56.233 --> 29:58.348
Man, I signed up to be a mail carrier,

29:58.350 --> 30:01.097
not Michael Phelps round this,
you know what I'm sayin'?

30:02.170 --> 30:05.508
If you don't think
you can hack it, quit.

30:05.510 --> 30:07.888
Oh, you would like that, wouldn't you?

30:07.890 --> 30:09.108
I ain't quittin'.

30:09.110 --> 30:12.378
I'ma outlast your ass, Mr. Cocks.

30:12.380 --> 30:13.478
We'll see about that.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.178
Hey, can I get everybody's attention?

30:16.180 --> 30:17.418
First of all, ladies and gentlemen,

30:17.420 --> 30:19.183
you guys have been amazing.

30:20.090 --> 30:25.090
Let me be the first to welcome
you to the postal service.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.800
You're officially mail carriers.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.078
Now, we got some business to take care of

30:29.080 --> 30:30.378
before we get out of here.

30:30.380 --> 30:32.478
So, I got a couple of rules for you,

30:32.480 --> 30:35.468
and I'll be lettin' you know
where you'll be stationed.

30:35.470 --> 30:38.358
Now, every station does
not need a mail carrier,

30:38.360 --> 30:40.618
so at least one of you will be stationed

30:40.620 --> 30:43.258
with someone from this class.

30:43.260 --> 30:47.213
In which case, it is
your position to lose.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.168
Now, there's two things
that'll get you terminated.

30:51.170 --> 30:55.393
One is not delivering all of the sale ads.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.903
Don't be stealing no coupons, Jennifer.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.168
And, two, a roll away.

31:04.170 --> 31:06.721
Can anybody tell me what a roll away is?

(PLAYFUL MUSIC)

31:08.180 --> 31:09.618

31:09.620 --> 31:11.418
That occurs when you
do not turn your wheel

31:11.420 --> 31:14.098
towards the curb and
apply your safety break.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.938
Your mail truck could roll down the street

31:15.940 --> 31:16.771
without you in it.

31:16.773 --> 31:18.973
That's exactly right, Harry Cocks.

31:20.270 --> 31:22.918
So, your mail truck is
rolling down the street,

31:22.920 --> 31:24.288
and you're not in it.

31:24.290 --> 31:25.620
How dangerous is that?

31:27.040 --> 31:28.788
I got news for you:

31:28.790 --> 31:31.213
that's grounds for immediate termination.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.088
So, ladies and gentlemen,
be careful out there.

32:07.070 --> 32:09.038
Look, I'm not here to make any friends,

so everybody should have a good day today.

32:53.450 --> 32:54.588
Everybody.

32:54.590 --> 32:56.208
There's no rain in the forecast,

32:56.210 --> 32:58.308
but the heat index is up,

32:58.310 --> 33:00.838
so make sure you got plenty of water,

put all the DPS mail together

34:12.440 --> 34:13.838
if I gotta wake up to this every day, man,

34:47.400 --> 34:48.678

obviously wear what they like,

01:25:27.641 --> 01:25:28.808
Bring it in.

01:25:31.529 --> 01:25:33.823
I knew you had it in you.

01:25:33.825 --> 01:25:34.905
I knew it.

01:25:34.907 --> 01:25:37.260
BRIAN: We did it!

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:38.095
We did it.

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:43.038
BRIAN VOICEOVER: Well, that's my story.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.833
Every postman has one,

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.728
but this one was mine.

01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:49.858
As far as the post office goes,

01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:51.588
the gang's still there,

01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:53.218
most of them, anyway.

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:54.848
Once I became master trainer,

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:59.850
my first trainee was none
other than Snuffleupagus.

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:02.188
He's a pretty good worker, too.

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:05.008
Now, Harry Cocks got
fired once they found out

01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:07.648
he was the one that
tampered with my brake.

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:10.778
Word is that boy workin'
over at B&M Bar-B-Que.

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.088
They say he make a mean
shoulder sandwich, too.

01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:15.848
When Mack finally woke up,

01:26:15.850 --> 01:26:18.608
the police was all over his ass.

01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:22.808
He got 20 years for the
kidnapping for little Aaliyah.

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:24.118
Me,

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.428
I'm lovin' life, baby,

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.135
'cause you know what?

01:26:27.137 --> 01:26:28.798
For the first time in my life,

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.583
I'm fully happy.

01:26:31.973 --> 01:26:35.053
I finally, finally got
the love of my life.

01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:37.993
Me and Jevonne doin' real well, too.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.615
I'm even thinkin' about marryin' my baby.

01:26:41.617 --> 01:26:42.678
Who would've thought Brian Lincoln

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:46.028
would be talkin' about marriage?

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:47.818
Now, a part of that reward

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:51.208
for findin' little Aaliyah was $10,000.

01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:53.716
I used that to help
pay off my mom's bills,

01:26:53.718 --> 01:26:56.133
so she could finally get that surgery.

01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:58.082
(UPBEAT MUSIC)

01:26:58.084 --> 01:26:58.915
When y'all first met me,

01:26:58.917 --> 01:27:00.338
they called me a loser.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.838
Now, when they see me,

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.396
they say, "Hey, Mr. Postman!"

01:27:04.398 --> 01:27:07.065
