WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:02.701
(cellphone rings)

00:02.703 --> 00:04.336
Hello?
Hey, babe.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.604
How's the dog-walking gig
going?

00:05.606 --> 00:07.039
Oh, great, babe.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.942
I got Muffin here
and Delores, Clancy, Gizmo,

00:09.944 --> 00:11.977
and, of course, Cody.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.645
(chuckles)
Little guy.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.147
Jeff,
it's your first day,

00:15.149 --> 00:16.982
and you remembered
every dog's name?

00:16.984 --> 00:18.784
Oh, I don't know
if that's their real names.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.285
It's just what
I've been calling them.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.321
Wow, Jeff,
you're really getting good

00:22.323 --> 00:24.356
at making up names.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.660
Um, Jeff,
I think someone might be here.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.963
Oh, my God.
I totally forgot.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.631
It's happening!

00:32.633 --> 00:34.500
Jeff, listen carefully.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.735
I'm going to get taken.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.872
He's here.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.573
I don't think he sees --

00:41.575 --> 00:43.075
(screaming)

00:43.077 --> 00:45.044
There you are, Hayley.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.379
Fooled again
by my decoy legs.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.515
Let's go.
It's President's Day!

00:49.517 --> 00:51.917
(groans)
Thanks, boys.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.819
The rest of the day's
yours.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.557
(patriotic music plays)

00:58.559 --> 01:01.026
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:01.028 --> 01:04.997
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:04.999 --> 01:08.033
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:08.035 --> 01:12.404
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:14.241 --> 01:17.576
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

01:17.578 --> 01:19.878
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:19.880 --> 01:21.180
Aah!

01:22.516 --> 01:25.851
¶<i> Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ¶

01:28.389 --> 01:30.422
In just 5 1/2 hours,

01:30.424 --> 01:33.058
we'll be at the historic home
of our 20th president,

01:33.060 --> 01:34.860
James Garfield.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.295
Before you ask,
James Garfield

01:36.297 --> 01:38.764
is in no way related
to Garfield the Cat.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.265
I know.
I'm as surprised as you are.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.902
But, Dad, I was gonna go see
"Step Up 6" today.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.904
Ironically, of course.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.574
Although I do love the dancing
and the characters.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.043
But it's so lame.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.811
The stories are pretty awesome,
too.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.214
Well, history's full
of awesome stories.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.582
That's why every
President's Day,

01:56.584 --> 01:58.317
we visit
a presidential museum.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.886
You've always loved it.
You make me go.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.888
You used to
put me on a leash.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.692
¶¶

02:26.847 --> 02:28.947
Hayley, as a husband
and father,

02:28.949 --> 02:31.683
there are only a few things more
important to me than family.

02:31.685 --> 02:35.187
The first is American history,
followed by God, bald eagles,

02:35.189 --> 02:36.455
and all sports.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.524
Go Bazooka Sharks!
'Zooka Sharks!

02:38.526 --> 02:40.359
You need to know history,

02:40.361 --> 02:42.327
especially now that you're old
enough to vote for president.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.763
(tires screech)

02:44.765 --> 02:46.932
Oh, my God, you're gonna choose
the president!

02:46.934 --> 02:48.700
Listen carefully,
Hayley.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.502
I'll tell you who I'm voting for
so you can vote for him, too.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.905
Don't you mean her?
(hisses)

02:56.343 --> 02:58.210
(school bell rings)

02:58.212 --> 02:59.678
Kids, you're all here
for one reason.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.680
You signed up
for the school newspaper

03:01.682 --> 03:03.782
so you wouldn't have to
do a sport this semester.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.450
I got hurt last time.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.453
Well, you ran your fastest,
and you fell down.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.622
That would hurt anybody.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.058
Here are your assignments.
O'Brien, debate team.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.195
Westbrook, student council.
Smith, football practice.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.231
Uh, sir, I was actually hoping
to cover the cheerleaders.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.134
I heard whoever reports on
the cheerleaders gets their pick

03:22.136 --> 03:23.669
of the bottom row
of the pyramid.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.070
It's true, Smith.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.572
The cheerleader beat guarantees

03:26.574 --> 03:29.575
dating a thick
bottom-row beauty.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.677
But there's no way
I'm assigning a rookie

03:31.679 --> 03:33.145
to report on the cheerleaders.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.880
But I don't know anything
about football.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.448
Just write what you see.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.752
(whispering)
So, you're a reporter now.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.688
Roger?
Don't call me Roger.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.257
Call me Deep Throat.
What are you doing?

03:45.259 --> 03:47.693
Every reporter needs
a Deep Throat, sonny.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.027
And I know things.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.029
I've seen things
around this school.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.666
I have a story for you
that'll turn you into a legend.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.002
I don't need
a Deep Throat, Roger.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.638
I bought the jacket, Steve.
I'm doing this.

04:02.176 --> 04:03.675
In this room,
we have many

04:03.677 --> 04:06.278
of President Garfield's
favorite things,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.081
but before you ask,
we don't have any lasagna.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.517
(laughs)
I made a joke like that earlier.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.954
Look, Hayley, there's James
Garfield's personal teapot.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.523
And his cooking pot.
And his chamber pot!

04:18.525 --> 04:19.925
It's all one pot!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.960
Isn't that fascinating?
It's gross.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.863
That's life
in the 18-sizzles.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.367
Now, here's a portrait
of President Garfield.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.270
I know what you're thinking.
He's very handsome.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.971
(chuckles)

04:32.973 --> 04:34.973
If I weren't already married,
I'd let this fella court me.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.275
(laughs)

04:36.277 --> 04:39.077
But I am married.
Happily so.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.646
To a doctor lawyer.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.047
Who's that?

04:42.049 --> 04:43.815
That's Charles Guiteau,
the psychopath

04:43.817 --> 04:45.884
who tracked President Garfield
down like a bloodhound

04:45.886 --> 04:47.386
and assassinated him.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.887
Guiteau was so crazy,

04:48.889 --> 04:51.623
he kept all his toenail
clippings in a jar.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.126
Here, you can have one.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.597
This stuff
is gross and boring.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.099
Oh, really?
I want you to look me in the eye

05:01.101 --> 05:04.603
and tell me this shoe box
of dusty beard combs is boring.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.937
(yawns)

05:05.939 --> 05:07.439
No, no!
No, no!

05:07.441 --> 05:09.274
Don't you dare disrespect
President Garfield

05:09.276 --> 05:11.009
by yawning in his library.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.612
(all yawning)
Look what you're doing!

05:13.614 --> 05:16.281
You're patient zero
of this yawn outbreak!

05:16.283 --> 05:18.483
(yawns)

05:18.485 --> 05:20.652
Oh, God!
I'm infected!

05:20.654 --> 05:22.421
I'm going out
on my own terms!

05:22.423 --> 05:24.356
(yawns)

05:24.358 --> 05:27.859
I did it.
I hurt myself.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.562
(sighs)

05:31.832 --> 05:34.132
Oh, do you mind
if I eat my lunch here?

05:34.134 --> 05:37.135
My husband makes me a
tuna-fish sandwich every day,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.770
and I usually take it out
to my car

05:38.772 --> 05:40.505
since the tuna's
very fragrant.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.141
You don't have a husband.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.610
(whistle blows)

05:46.847 --> 05:49.514
Oh, man, look at Stephanie
over there.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.784
I am all about that bass.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.186
Peter's so lucky.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.787
No! Focus!

05:55.789 --> 05:57.656
Put all this energy
into your reporting.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.024
Just write what I see.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.392
Okay.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.127
What do I --

06:02.129 --> 06:06.064
(groans)
W-What was that thing?!

06:06.066 --> 06:08.567
¶¶

06:08.569 --> 06:12.337
Oh, Hayley, I can't believe
you missed "Step Up 6."

06:12.339 --> 06:14.539
It was totes on fleek,
bruh!

06:14.541 --> 06:16.208
At one point,
Jenna was like,

06:16.210 --> 06:18.510
"Shawty don't play that way,"
and Brittney was like,

06:18.512 --> 06:20.645
"Youse ain't nothin'
but a skim-toast honey."

06:20.647 --> 06:23.348
Really?
I'm so bummed I missed it.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.084
Ugh, I wasted the whole day
at the Garfield museum.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.486
I got a hat.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.988
Hayley, I know you think
history is boring,

06:29.990 --> 06:32.824
but I found someone
I bet can change your mind.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.327
James Garfield!

06:35.329 --> 06:37.496
Greetings.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.098
Take a load off, Garfy.
I'm Klaus.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.567
I'm a bit of a favorite
around here.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.174
So, who's this?

06:49.176 --> 06:52.077
I am
James Abram Garfield,

06:52.079 --> 06:54.746
20th President
and Commander in Chief

06:54.748 --> 06:57.082
of the 38 United States.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.051
Oh.
Are you one of Stan's friends?

07:00.053 --> 07:02.621
Do you really expect us to
believe that's James Garfield?

07:02.623 --> 07:04.389
Well, yes.

07:04.391 --> 07:07.259
I took President Garfield's
beard comb from the museum,

07:07.261 --> 07:09.294
extracted DNA
from one of the hairs,

07:09.296 --> 07:11.396
then used the new C.I.A.
re-genesis lab

07:11.398 --> 07:14.933
to "Jurassic Park" him
back to life.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.936
But "Jurassic Park" wasn't real.
It was a movie.

07:17.938 --> 07:22.073
Sounds like somebody's been
to Trinidad but not Tobego.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.309
W-Why would you do this?

07:24.311 --> 07:26.378
Because you need to
learn about history.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.646
And who's a better teacher

07:27.648 --> 07:29.648
than someone
who is living history?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.483
How did you get
the old-fashioned clothes?

07:31.485 --> 07:34.252
Easy. I dug up his grave
and put him in his funeral suit.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.154
What?!
(chuckling)
I'm kidding, Hayley.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.489
I had Garfield do it.

07:37.491 --> 07:41.293
There were thousands
of worms in me!

07:41.295 --> 07:43.795
(jazz music plays)

07:45.833 --> 07:49.634
"At the snap, Jones busted
through the tight end,

07:49.636 --> 07:51.470
squirting into the backfield

07:51.472 --> 07:55.340
and wrapping up the muscular
quarterback from behind,

07:55.342 --> 07:59.177
pounding him hard
deep into the ground

07:59.179 --> 08:01.847
before he could get it off.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.249
Another tough sack."

08:04.251 --> 08:07.185
Now, that is
how you cover football practice.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.688
I can't wait to see what you do
with your next assignment.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.989
Great work, Smith.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.624
I just wrote what I saw.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.926
Well, it's the most
sensual piece of writing

08:14.928 --> 08:16.495
I've ever come across.

08:16.497 --> 08:20.599
And I've<i> come</i> across a lot
of sensual writing.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.434
Eh?

08:22.436 --> 08:25.704
You forget a lot, right,
that you're our principal?

08:27.207 --> 08:29.641
(whispering) Hey there.
Hey, hey.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.209
(loudly) Hey!

08:31.211 --> 08:33.378
(whispering)
You want the scoop?
Not really.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.014
You've got a big story
right in front of you, Steve.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.050
You just have to figure it out
for yourself.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.454
I'm afraid I can't say any more.

08:42.456 --> 08:45.090
You'll hear from me
when the time is right.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.060
I was supposed to
get on that bus,

08:49.062 --> 08:51.062
but there was a lady
with a chicken on there.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.064
What is this, like, Guatemala?
What the hell?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.133
Leave your bird at home, lady.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.702
I can't really
hear what you're saying!

09:00.207 --> 09:02.474
Ah,
the United States Treasury.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.809
There is so much history
in this building.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.512
Alexander Hamilton established
the national bank here.

09:07.514 --> 09:10.649
The song
¶ Money, money, money, money ¶

09:10.651 --> 09:11.917
¶ Money ¶

09:11.919 --> 09:13.184
was written here.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.353
Both events
of equal importance.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.422
Are you taking notes,
Hayley?
Yeah, no.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.424
You see why you're here,
President Garfield?

09:19.426 --> 09:22.861
Why don't you tell her
about your famous bimetal
monetary system.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.529
It was one
of your great passions.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.765
Only after women
and billiards.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.433
(laughs)

09:28.435 --> 09:31.570
There's the kind of half-joke
that inspired the comic strip.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.238
Look!
There's a penny press!

09:33.240 --> 09:36.174
Good heavens!
The pictures are moving!

09:36.176 --> 09:37.542
That's a movie.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.344
It's where tweens
go to get fingered.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.713
It's beautiful.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.516
Yeah. Wish we could go
to a movie right now.

09:44.518 --> 09:47.052
Well, why don't we go?
Really?

09:47.054 --> 09:49.955
I assume it's better than
listening to this muckamuck.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.757
So, as a Mint worker,
you must get chicks.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.593
No.
That's incredible to me.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.127
And you tell them
you're a Mint worker?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.596
Of course.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.464
They must be noticing your face
like I am.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.601
Let's sneak away in that
terrifying horseless carriage

10:02.603 --> 10:04.302
we came in.
Let's do it.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.637
There's the exit.

10:07.975 --> 10:11.710
Dear girl,
you can read?!

10:11.712 --> 10:14.212
(hip-hop music playing)

10:14.214 --> 10:16.314
BRITTNEY:
Sit down, you skim-toast honey.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.416
You can't hang
with the bang-bang boogies.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.051
Oh, no, you can't,
chicken head!

10:20.053 --> 10:21.753
Nice try, chicken head!

10:21.755 --> 10:25.624
This...is...incredible!

10:25.626 --> 10:27.659
Oh, orange soda?
Yeah.

10:27.661 --> 10:32.297
This magical beverage
is called orange soda?

10:32.299 --> 10:35.800
Stop! Stop the devil dancing
and hop-hop music!

10:35.802 --> 10:38.269
My fellow citizens,

10:38.271 --> 10:43.141
I present to you an innovation
of magnificent import!

10:43.143 --> 10:46.311
It is called orange soda!

10:46.313 --> 10:49.014
Not since the invention
of the telegraph

10:49.016 --> 10:52.584
has this country
encountered such ingenuity.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.953
Is it a fruit,
or is it drink?!

10:54.955 --> 10:57.489
It's drink!
No matter the answer,

10:57.491 --> 10:59.024
this artificial orange

10:59.026 --> 11:02.661
has bested the orange
provided us by nature.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.296
This concoction
I hold in my hand

11:05.298 --> 11:07.265
indicates the exact moment

11:07.267 --> 11:10.935
where man has
triumphed over God!

11:10.937 --> 11:15.540
I hereby declare today
Orange Soda Day!

11:15.542 --> 11:18.576
Nice speech,
chicken head!

11:19.613 --> 11:21.546
That was
really beautiful.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.381
I gave
a very similar speech

11:23.383 --> 11:26.785
when water went
from brown to clear.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.087
(sensual music plays)

11:32.225 --> 11:36.394
PRINCIPAL LEWIS:
"The students arrive
with bulging purple veins,

11:36.396 --> 11:38.897
eager for release."

11:42.402 --> 11:45.403
"They study the supple curves
of a parabola

11:45.405 --> 11:49.474
to find where
the latus rectum is."

11:49.476 --> 11:52.043
"During practice,
they touch their counterparts

11:52.045 --> 11:54.079
lightly in the chest

11:54.081 --> 11:56.715
with only the tip."

11:56.717 --> 12:01.486
"The boys pump sweet jelly
into the little triangle,

12:01.488 --> 12:04.923
careful not to overfill
its delicate folds.

12:04.925 --> 12:09.227
Now the hamantaschen
is ready for Passover."

12:11.832 --> 12:14.065
"Cum laude."

12:14.067 --> 12:19.204
Cum real laude.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.574
Um...is detention over?

12:22.576 --> 12:24.375
It's been an hour.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.277
Fine, get back to class.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.513
But no more pointing out errors
in the textbooks.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.783
You'll remember the Alambo,
and you'll like it.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.285
¶¶

12:34.287 --> 12:35.887
(chuckles)

12:35.889 --> 12:37.122
(soda can pops)
Shh.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.857
As long
as we don't wake up my dad,

12:38.859 --> 12:41.059
he'll totally forget
we ditched him in the morning.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.927
Okay.
I'll lie down,

12:42.929 --> 12:45.463
but I don't foresee sleep
in my future.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.900
Feels like there's a possum
dancing on my heart.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.269
(chuckles)
It's just your body

12:51.271 --> 12:54.706
frantically trying
to process 18 orange sodas.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.978
Where have you two been?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.479
Nowhere.
Everywhere!

13:01.481 --> 13:04.215
We saw "Step Up 6,"
we drank orange soda,

13:04.217 --> 13:06.451
we rode
a subterranean boxcar!

13:06.453 --> 13:08.219
Shut up...
Mr. President.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.088
Dad,
we had a good time.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.790
I saw a Polynesian!

13:11.792 --> 13:14.425
No! No, no, no!
This is unacceptable!

13:14.427 --> 13:16.127
The only reason
I brought you to life

13:16.129 --> 13:18.663
was to teach Hayley history,
but you're useless!

13:18.665 --> 13:20.465
Don't yell at him,
Dad.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.133
I-I don't know how
to get this through your head,

13:22.135 --> 13:24.135
but I don't care
about history.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.770
And in case
you're wondering,

13:25.772 --> 13:27.238
this is the first
President's Day

13:27.240 --> 13:28.973
I have ever enjoyed.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.476
You know, in fact, I would
rather spend any day with him

13:31.478 --> 13:33.945
than with you.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.514
As we used to say
in the 1800s,

13:36.516 --> 13:39.818
awkward.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.320
(sensual music plays)

13:42.322 --> 13:45.323
(students moaning)

13:45.325 --> 13:48.293
Circulation is up, and the
<i>Princeton Review</i> just named us

13:48.295 --> 13:50.862
"Horniest school
in the Greater Langley Area."

13:50.864 --> 13:53.164
Smith,
the cheerleaders are yours.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.933
Finally!

13:54.935 --> 13:56.467
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.169
I've been so consumed
with my duties here at the paper

13:58.171 --> 14:00.538
that I've completely forgotten
to feed the janitors.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.310
¶¶

14:05.312 --> 14:09.113
(all imitating pigs squealing)

14:15.055 --> 14:16.688
Hey, have you
seen Garfield?

14:16.690 --> 14:19.724
Oh, your dad's friend?
They went to the C.I.A.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.359
Stan said something like

14:21.361 --> 14:23.661
(as Stan) "I'm gonna turn him
back into proteins."

14:23.663 --> 14:25.530
What?!
(normal voice) Yeah.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.299
And then he said (as Stan)
"Are you even listening
to me, Francine?

14:28.301 --> 14:32.303
I'm worried about us. I feel
like we've been drifting apart."

14:32.305 --> 14:34.472
(laughs)

14:34.474 --> 14:36.674
(normal voice) I'm getting
better at his voice, right?

14:36.676 --> 14:39.444
The key
is really listening.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.318
Stan,
what is all this about?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.554
Why are you being
such a muckamuck?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.689
If you're not gonna
<i> teach</i> history,

14:51.691 --> 14:54.158
you're gonna<i> be</i> history.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.261
May I at least have
one final sip of orange soda?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.529
Fine.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.831
Aah!

14:59.833 --> 15:01.065
(laughs)

15:01.067 --> 15:03.701
I shook them in the car
earlier!

15:03.703 --> 15:06.304
(laughs)

15:07.240 --> 15:09.407
That was from
an hour ago.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.376
Didn't even stop
when I yelled, "Stop."

15:11.378 --> 15:13.444
It's like when I'm trying
to watch Fallon

15:13.446 --> 15:15.513
and my wife
won't stop banging me.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.715
Garfield doesn't deserve
to be killed.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.450
God,
we were just having fun.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.252
I need to find him
before my dad does.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.888
Good luck tracking that guy
down. He's clever.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.556
He threw up a ton
of orange stuff

15:25.558 --> 15:27.892
and then slipped right
out of his straight jacket.

15:27.894 --> 15:31.629
There was someone
who tracked Garfield down.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.031
Like a bloodhound.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.166
And I have his toenail!

15:40.073 --> 15:42.707
Has anyone seen a man
with a beard?

15:42.709 --> 15:43.975
Whoa.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.577
It's cool
to have a beard now.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.912
God, where could he be?

15:47.914 --> 15:50.448
BARISTA: I got
an orange chai latte here.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.716
Orange.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.318
Wait a minute,
everyone shut up!

15:53.320 --> 15:54.752
Orange.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.422
Orange you glad
I didn't say banana?

15:57.424 --> 16:00.158
(gasps)
He's at the banana soda factory!

16:00.160 --> 16:01.893
That closed years ago.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.261
That's right.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.063
Okay,
now I need complete silence,

16:05.065 --> 16:06.898
and I'm not kidding
anymore.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.069
You have an idea, don't you?
It's okay, just say it.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.904
Orange soda fac--
Orange soda factory!

16:12.906 --> 16:14.539
Shut up!
I did it.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.344
(panting)

16:19.346 --> 16:22.680
Okay, Mr. Guiteau. I know
you're a presidential assassin,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.649
and from what I read
on Murderpedia,

16:24.651 --> 16:26.351
you're probably
legally insane.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.687
I've not seen such bright lights
since I came out the cervix!

16:29.689 --> 16:32.290
But I really need you
to help me find my friend --

16:32.292 --> 16:33.591
James Garfield.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.859
Garfield?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.361
He must see
the devil's eye!

16:36.363 --> 16:38.529
(sniffing)

16:38.531 --> 16:39.964
(grunting)

16:39.966 --> 16:42.467
(school bell rings)

16:42.469 --> 16:45.269
All right, you horn dogs.
Gather round.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.305
And let's hear
what the Shakespeare

16:47.307 --> 16:49.307
of soft-core student journalism

16:49.309 --> 16:52.110
has to say
about the cheerleaders.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.712
All right, all right,
all right! Yeah!

16:54.714 --> 16:56.681
"The cheerleading squad
took their talents

16:56.683 --> 17:00.218
to the South Lakes Invitational
on Friday night.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.286
They arrived in their warm-ups,

17:02.288 --> 17:04.689
although they already
looked pretty hot."

17:04.691 --> 17:07.158
Clean up
on aisle my stomach!

17:07.160 --> 17:09.727
"As they peeled off
their sweatpants,

17:09.729 --> 17:11.195
the tournament happened,

17:11.197 --> 17:13.031
and it's my understanding
they came in third."

17:13.033 --> 17:15.199
What?!
That's not sexy.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.968
This thing isn't even al dente.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.336
I don't know
what happened!

17:18.338 --> 17:20.872
I saw one high leg kick,
and I passed out!

17:20.874 --> 17:22.874
Boo!
Smith's a tease!

17:22.876 --> 17:25.443
(students booing)

17:27.881 --> 17:29.213
(whispering) Steve.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.650
Did you paint a shadow
on your face?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.719
(normal voice) I was
dressed up in blackface earlier.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.654
You're not the only one
with stuff going on.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.890
Looks like you finally
figured out the story.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.159
No, I didn't.
I have no idea what's happening.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.261
You<i> were</i> the story, Steve.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.930
You used all your pent-up
sexual frustration

17:45.932 --> 17:47.932
to turn out
the most elegant pornography

17:47.934 --> 17:49.734
this school has ever seen.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.669
But when you finally
saw a little skin,

17:51.671 --> 17:53.438
it was too much for you,
and you experienced

17:53.440 --> 17:57.075
what medical experts
refer to as an "ejacu-faint."

17:57.077 --> 17:59.911
That's when 100% of your blood
is in your wiener.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.245
You're lucky to be alive,
Steve.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.114
And that's the real headline.
Nope.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.450
The real headline
is you're fired.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.218
Looks like you're the second
worst reporter out there

18:07.220 --> 18:08.953
named Stephen A. Smith.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.598
(gulping) Ahh.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.034
Garfield!
I'm taking you back to the lab.

18:23.036 --> 18:25.269
Are you off your chump,
sir?

18:25.271 --> 18:28.606
I just tapped this 20-ton
cylinder of orange soda.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.741
(panting) My president!
Aah!

18:30.743 --> 18:34.078
I must give you
an eternal earth bath!

18:34.080 --> 18:36.247
Hayley, what are you doing here?
Let go of that man.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.216
But, Dad,
it's Charles Guiteau.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.151
If I let him go,
he'll kill Garfield.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.320
You remembered
Charles Guiteau?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.388
I guess I did learn something
about history.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.891
I'm taking you
to the lordy!

18:46.893 --> 18:48.993
Aah!
(laughs evilly)

18:48.995 --> 18:50.394
(neck cracks)

18:50.396 --> 18:52.497
Aah!
Hayley, no!

18:52.499 --> 18:55.066
(dramatic music plays)

19:32.105 --> 19:35.873
(music continues)

19:41.481 --> 19:43.514
¶ So I put my hands up ¶

19:43.516 --> 19:45.149
¶ They're playin' my song ¶

19:45.151 --> 19:47.852
¶ The butterflies
fly away ¶

19:47.854 --> 19:50.688
¶ I'm noddin' my head
like yeah ¶

19:50.690 --> 19:52.790
Baby girl!
You're okay!

19:52.792 --> 19:54.525
I think my arm
is broken in sev--

19:54.527 --> 19:56.227
(gasps)
I was wrong.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.629
These President's Day trips
were never about history.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.398
They were about spending time
with you,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.300
driving all over the map.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.636
I'm embarrassed to say this,
but I care more about you

20:05.638 --> 20:08.973
than the presidents.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.542
So, any chance
we can let Garfield live?

20:11.544 --> 20:14.145
Why not? Besides, at the rate
he's drinking orange soda,

20:14.147 --> 20:15.646
he'll be dead in a month.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.082
(Miley Cyrus'
"Party in the U.S.A." plays)

20:30.230 --> 20:31.562
¶ I put my hands up ¶

20:34.067 --> 20:35.733
"Step Up 6" just came out,

20:35.735 --> 20:37.435
and there's already
a "Step Up 7."

20:37.437 --> 20:39.170
Isn't that great?
Do I need to know anything

20:39.172 --> 20:40.871
from the first six
to get what's happening?

20:40.873 --> 20:43.207
GIRL:
Oh, you turnt it up, young swag.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.042
You got to mupload that ish.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.711
Well,
I think I'm caught up.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.447
Did you hear that old man
talkin' 'bout bein' on fleek?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.881
That's so last year.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.917
Get with the times, muckamuck.

20:52.919 --> 20:56.687

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
