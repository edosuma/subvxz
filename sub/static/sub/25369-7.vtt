Pete says the party's gotta end,
like now.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.644
What's happening?

00:18.644 --> 00:22.064
You and Pete just ran off,
real weird‐style.

00:22.064 --> 00:25.484
<i>"Weird"? Noooo.</i>
<i>Totally normal.</i>

00:25.484 --> 00:28.111
Just something, uh,
personal came up.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.529
[chuckles]
Way too personal.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.491
<i>So can you,</i>
<i>in a totally normal way,</i>

00:32.491 --> 00:35.035

00:36.662 --> 00:40.123
Okay, whatever.
This party was dead anyway.

[Spider‐Man]
Venom could be anywhere.

And he won't set off
our spider‐sense,
so keep an eye out.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.094
I'll keep both eyes out.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.930
But now that the sonics
don't affect
the symbiote anymore,

00:54.930 --> 00:57.224
do you have a plan
for how to stop him?
Nope.

00:57.224 --> 01:01.144
But I do know this:
Venom came to my house
looking for Peter Parker.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.356
He's going after the people
he thinks wronged him
when he was just Eddie Brock,

01:04.356 --> 01:06.149
before he bonded
with that space goo.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.069
We need to check places
that Eddie goes all the time,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.989

Don't blame everyone else

We came to help you!
This is you helping?

my secret identity,

he'd take Jameson back
to his own apartment?

That would be some bad
super‐villaining.

No. He's not that crazy.
But maybe we can
figure out his endgame.

Hey, you think Venom
has a master plan?

to see him take JJJ.

we've gotta figure out.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.713
[grunting]
I'm going to enjoy

11:53.713 --> 11:57.300
destroying my victims
while you watch!

11:57.300 --> 11:59.177
May Parker,

11:59.177 --> 12:02.722
Gwen Stacy, Anya Corazon,

12:02.722 --> 12:05.391
Max Modell, Jameson!

12:05.391 --> 12:08.228
Everyone closest to you!

12:08.228 --> 12:10.647
Jameson? Close to me?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.774
I think you're misinterpreting
our relationship.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.026
No.

12:15.026 --> 12:19.697
That one's for me.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.659
[both grunting]

12:26.079 --> 12:27.956
[roars]

12:27.956 --> 12:31.876
Okay, Electro‐discs.
I designed you
to fight Octobots,

12:31.876 --> 12:34.212
but let's see if you
can help me out here!

12:34.212 --> 12:36.798
Aaahhh!
[roars]

12:37.840 --> 12:39.884
[sizzling]

12:39.884 --> 12:42.512
Okay, fried symbiote
smells terrible.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.097
Good to know.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.309
[grunts]

12:48.309 --> 12:51.437
What happened
to that monster?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.898
He's down,
but he's not out.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.775
You need
to get out of here now.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.320
Okay, but I'm not leaving
without everyone else.

12:59.320 --> 13:04.200
That thing‐‐ it's a version
of the V‐252 that we
experimented on, right?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.995
That's why it captured
Horizon students
and their family members.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.997
I can grab sonic devices
from the lab, and‐‐

13:08.997 --> 13:12.166
It's evolved past
its weakness for sonics.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.003
What I need you to do
is help everyone get to safety.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.216
I know I'm gonna regret this
the moment I remove
the gag, but‐‐

13:20.216 --> 13:21.759
Citizen's arrest!
Ouch.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.761
Spider‐Man's behind all of this!
Uh‐huh.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.931
It's all his fault!
Wha‐‐ My fault?

13:26.931 --> 13:30.768
Eddie Brock's doing all this
because you demoted him
and treated him like garbage!

13:30.768 --> 13:33.438
This is his revenge on me
and on you.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.273
Have you no decency?

13:35.273 --> 13:37.483
Your web of lies
knows no bounds!

13:37.483 --> 13:39.319
Aah!

13:39.319 --> 13:41.320
We weren't finished.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.240
[growling]
Get out of here!

13:44.240 --> 13:46.075
Run!

13:46.075 --> 13:48.661
[both grunting]

13:52.040 --> 13:54.042
[grunting]

13:54.042 --> 13:58.254
Of course you couldn't be
bothered to finish freeing me,
you clown!

13:58.254 --> 14:00.673
Okay, Venom,
we can agree on one thing‐‐

14:00.673 --> 14:02.717
Jameson's a grade‐A jerk.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.552
[grunts]
I can hear you.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.597
But even he doesn't deserve
what you've done to him.

14:07.597 --> 14:11.893
I'm immune to flattery,
Spider‐Man,
so don't bother!

14:11.893 --> 14:15.897
If your plan was to break me,
you failed, Venom.

14:15.897 --> 14:20.860
[growls]
I'm just getting started.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.195
[roars]

14:22.195 --> 14:24.572
[grunts]

14:26.991 --> 14:28.910
[Spider‐Man grunting]

14:28.910 --> 14:30.661
[Venom laughing]

14:33.623 --> 14:36.959
Ever wonder
how Peter Parker

14:36.959 --> 14:41.798
got all those wonderful shots
of Spider‐Man?

14:41.798 --> 14:45.635
Because Parker's got more talent
in his pinkie finger

14:45.635 --> 14:47.720
than you ever dreamed
of having, Brock.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.183
Or maybe there's another reason.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.185
[straining]

14:55.853 --> 14:56.896
No!

14:56.896 --> 14:59.398
[grunts]

14:59.398 --> 15:05.029
Parker is Spider‐Man.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.034
Parker?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.578
[grunts]
[growls]

15:12.578 --> 15:15.123
This is... awkward.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.791
Parker!

15:16.791 --> 15:19.293
Let me explain.
[grunts]

15:19.293 --> 15:22.088
[laughing]

15:22.088 --> 15:26.008
Now you're truly broken,
Spider‐Man.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.303
Prepare to be destroyed.
[straining]

15:29.303 --> 15:31.430
[growling]

15:31.430 --> 15:32.890
[grunts]

15:32.890 --> 15:34.642
[grunts]

15:34.642 --> 15:38.938
He was playing you
for a fool, Jameson.

15:38.938 --> 15:43.151
Playing all of us for fools.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.279
And now he's going to pay.

15:46.279 --> 15:50.283
Are you ready
to meet your maker?
[growls]

15:50.283 --> 15:52.702
[Miles]
Do you ever stop talking?
[grunts]

15:52.702 --> 15:55.997
Aah!
[grunts, groans]

15:55.997 --> 15:59.417
And I thought I, Spider‐Man,
never stopped talking.

15:59.417 --> 16:03.171
Great job buying me
the time I needed, Parker.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.006
What is going on here?

16:05.006 --> 16:08.050
You've never heard of the old
"using a decoy Spider‐Man

16:08.050 --> 16:10.761
so you can develop some tech
to save the day" move?

16:10.761 --> 16:13.014
It's classic.
[Venom growls]

16:13.014 --> 16:14.974
Liar!

16:14.974 --> 16:17.894
Parker is Spider‐Man!

16:17.894 --> 16:21.397
Wow. That symbiote's
really messing
with your head, Brock.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.399
You think Spider‐Man's
a high school kid?

16:23.399 --> 16:26.736
You're as clueless
as you are ugly.
Now say good night.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.988
[roars]

16:28.988 --> 16:31.908
[screaming]

16:38.164 --> 16:41.542
How does this thing work...
Spider‐Man?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.003
If you must know,
Peter Parker,

16:44.003 --> 16:47.215
the Space Administration's tests
desensitized Venom to sonics.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.675
So this projects
a different
resonant frequency

16:49.675 --> 16:52.470
that disrupts
the symbiote's cohesion?
Exactly.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.097
It's designed
to put the symbiote
in a coma state,

16:55.097 --> 16:58.142
freeing anyone
the symbiote's bonded with.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.061
You're much smarter
than you look, kid.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.438
[quietly]
You're enjoying this
way too much.

17:02.438 --> 17:06.234
Where'd you get my costume?
Your lab,
under your gym shorts.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.612
I saw Venom rip off your mask,
and I had to think quick.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.198
But I wish I had nose plugs.
Blech!

17:12.198 --> 17:13.366
[growling]
He's back!

17:13.366 --> 17:16.035
[grunts]

17:16.035 --> 17:19.163
The device should've worked
a little better than that.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.082
He was out for what,
ten seconds?

17:21.082 --> 17:23.542
We need an acoustic chamber
to focus it.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.045
Too bad Horizon doesn't have
a basketball court.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.130
We totally have
a basketball court.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.424
We do?
How did I not know this?

17:30.424 --> 17:34.011
You gotta get out
of the lab more often.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.056
[grunts]
Two Spider‐Men

17:37.056 --> 17:41.018
will only make my victory
twice as delicious.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.603
[growls]

17:47.608 --> 17:50.236
[Peter]
Whoa, this place is huge.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.988
How have I missed this?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.575
[yells]

17:55.575 --> 18:00.580
I will destroy the both of you!
[roars]

18:00.580 --> 18:04.667
[Miles]
Whoa! Load up, Pete.
I'll keep him busy.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.253
[grunting]
[growling]

18:07.253 --> 18:11.048
It's not me
you should hate, Eddie.
I never wanted to hurt you.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.884
[growls]
[groans]

18:13.884 --> 18:17.054
Parker and Spider‐Man

18:17.054 --> 18:20.433
are the source of every problem!
[roars]

18:20.433 --> 18:23.519
[Peter]
I really didn't think
we'd be able to talk this out.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.526
[groaning]

18:31.777 --> 18:33.613
[screeching]

18:35.781 --> 18:38.701
Aah!
[roars]

18:40.786 --> 18:43.331
[screeching]

18:43.331 --> 18:47.376
No! You're hurting us!

18:54.091 --> 18:56.135
No!

18:56.135 --> 18:58.137
I'm nothing without you.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.233
Parker...

19:11.233 --> 19:14.236
[groaning]

19:17.490 --> 19:19.408
[exhales]

19:21.702 --> 19:24.413
The device shut down
the symbiote,

19:24.413 --> 19:26.457
but it was supposed
to separate Brock from it.

19:26.457 --> 19:29.085
What happened?
Maybe after all this time,

19:29.085 --> 19:31.671
the symbiote finally found
the perfect host‐‐

19:31.671 --> 19:35.299
[groaning softly]
someone as angry
as it is.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.808
Uh, look, JJJ,
I know it was confusing,

19:43.808 --> 19:45.810
but Spider‐Man asked me
to pose as him

19:45.810 --> 19:48.229
while he figured out
how to stop that monster.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.856
I knew Spider‐Man was a menace,

19:50.856 --> 19:54.068
but I never dreamed
you'd be working with him,
Parker!

19:54.068 --> 19:57.279
How many innocent people
got hurt because of you?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.990
You're fired!

19:59.990 --> 20:05.579
Well, guess your dreams
of being BFFs with JJJ
are crushed.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.290
Trust me, Pete,
getting fired by that guy

20:08.290 --> 20:11.293
is probably the best thing
that could've ever
happened to you.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.504
[sighs]
Yeah.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.215
But what am I gonna do
about money now?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.427
Man, can you not worry
for, like, five seconds?

20:19.427 --> 20:22.388
You saved your friends,
you saved your family,

20:22.388 --> 20:24.932
your secret identity
is still intact,

20:24.932 --> 20:26.475
and you shut down Venom.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.394
What more do you want?

20:28.394 --> 20:30.521
I think you owe me a bagel.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.150
So what's going
to happen to Brock?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.360
[Peter]
The Space Administration
scanned his vital signs.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.363
He's stable and in
some kind of coma.
[engine starts]

20:39.363 --> 20:42.408
They'll be working on a method
of separating him
from the symbiote.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.201
Better them than us.
[vehicle departing]

20:44.201 --> 20:47.538
I've seen enough
of the V‐252 for a lifetime.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.457
So...

20:49.457 --> 20:52.877
Eh, any interest in picking up
where the party left off?

20:52.877 --> 20:54.378
Wait.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.089
Peter Parker <i>wants</i> to party?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.508
I never got to play
a single game of chess.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.553
Plus you missed
my robot dance.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.639
[in robotic voice]
It was epic.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.601
Ugh! Well, at least Venom
saved me from having
to experience that.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.979
[chuckles]
You're just jealous
of my skills.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.315
Jealous?
[imitating robot sounds]

21:14.315 --> 21:18.444
[in robotic voice]
My robot skills
are known worldwide.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.322
Yeah, maybe having another party
is a terrible idea.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.532
Are you afraid, human?

21:23.532 --> 21:26.160
I can tell you are intimidated.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.288
Please stop.
[continues in robotic voice]
Peter Parker never quits.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.290
Oh, boy.
