WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:11.220
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name…

00:14.097 --> 00:14.556
Mom,

00:14.806 --> 00:16.808
where's my Che Guevara
t-shirt with the holes?

00:16.934 --> 00:19.269
It's in your dresser.
I sewed it back up for you.

00:20.020 --> 00:20.437
Mom… no!

00:20.646 --> 00:23.315
It took me hours to cut out those holes!

00:23.649 --> 00:25.150
Seriously, Mom? Another limpia?

00:25.651 --> 00:27.027
This isn't gonna make your eyes better.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.362
Limpias don't work.

00:28.654 --> 00:29.738
They worked for Pedro!

00:29.905 --> 00:30.948
Pedro died, Mom.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.784
But just before he died,
he won five hundred pesos in the lottery!

00:33.992 --> 00:35.536
That was a great funeral.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.246
I actually agree with Máximo.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.081
People who perform the limpias
are kind of weird and crazy.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.541
Come on, guys.

00:40.624 --> 00:41.458
That's my mom.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.628
Apologies, Doña Rosita.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.337
So sorry.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.548
Doña Rosita is my last hope.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.883
My doctor said my condition
is too advanced.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.760
Your cousin Berta is not a doctor!

00:51.927 --> 00:53.762
She's the receptionist
at a veterinarian's office.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.098
You need to see a real doctor
in Mexico City.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.642
I'm not going all the way there
for them to tell me I'm hopeless.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.018
I don't need a doctor.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.144
I have God.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.938
God might not be enough, Mom…

01:05.274 --> 01:06.191
Oh my God!

01:15.951 --> 01:18.996
Anyone else need a limpia?

01:19.204 --> 01:20.914
Yes please--
Forgive me for not believing!

01:26.503 --> 01:27.838
Ever since that day,

01:28.422 --> 01:30.883
I've never made fun
of your abuela's superstitions.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.177
I don't wanna be the guy
who causes the big one.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.511
Look at my house.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.014
I'd be the first to go
in the ocean.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.810
-Mínimo!
-Mínimo!

01:43.228 --> 01:44.938
let's go to the front yard.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.983
We don't wanna play fetch by these cliffs.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.069
I learned that the hard way.

01:51.153 --> 01:55.866
Anyway, the limpia wasn't even
the strangest part of my morning.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.582
Hey guys!

02:04.374 --> 02:05.125
Quick question.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.294
How do you know
when you're dating someone?

02:08.503 --> 02:10.255
What do you mean?
This is really uncomfortable.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.382
See, ever since
Nora and I went out for lunch,

02:12.466 --> 02:13.759
I've been over to your place more often.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.135
Mostly to fix things.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.721
So, does that mean I'm her boyfriend?

02:17.846 --> 02:18.430
Well…

02:18.972 --> 02:21.183
Have you asked her to be your girlfriend?

02:21.642 --> 02:22.559
No.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.269
That's very insightful, Memo.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.145
Thanks.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.897
But Máximo is the one you should talk to.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.524
He just got a girl.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.192
A gringa.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.693
A gringa?

02:31.735 --> 02:33.195
A New Yorker!

02:33.278 --> 02:34.738
A New Yorker!

02:35.697 --> 02:37.241
If there's one thing I learned from Becca

02:37.324 --> 02:38.909
is that in order to make
our dreams come true,

02:39.451 --> 02:40.577
we have to be bold.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.704
That's how I'm going to be from now on!

02:43.997 --> 02:44.581
So,

02:44.831 --> 02:47.876
if I want Nora to be my girlfriend,
I just have to be bold?

02:47.960 --> 02:48.418
Yes!

02:48.460 --> 02:49.127
Exactly!

02:49.461 --> 02:52.673
Oh well, I don't think I can do that.
But thank you anyway.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.264
Máximo. Amigo. Hey.
Don't wanna interrupt your lunch.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.516
Thank you for interrupting
my lunch to tell me that.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.851
Anyways.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.812
I'm having a gathering
tomorrow for Julia's birthday,

03:06.895 --> 03:10.607
and I wanted to invite you
since you two are amigos.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.775
I'd love to come.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.403
Also, it's great that you know
the Spanish word for friend,

03:14.486 --> 03:16.113
but you don't have to use it every time.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.907
Yeah, but we're not just friends,
you know, we're more like,

03:18.991 --> 03:21.201
What's the-- That word?

03:21.285 --> 03:22.160
Horses?

03:22.870 --> 03:23.912
Yes, Chad. We're horses.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.707
So, how was your trip with Julia?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.417
Well, it started great,

03:28.500 --> 03:31.170
and then when we were checking
into our hotel, I kinda screwed up.

03:33.088 --> 03:36.341
Hi. Welcome to the Marina Hotel.
May I please have the first and last name

03:36.425 --> 03:38.343
of the guests who will be staying
in your suite?

03:38.427 --> 03:40.596
Yes. It's Chad Davies and Julia…

03:49.479 --> 03:50.522
González.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.649
Yes. It's Julia González.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.651
That is totally correct.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.945
I mean, obviously, I know her last name.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.698
But you guys also sometimes
use a second last name.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.075
And so that just really confused me
and then that led

04:02.159 --> 04:04.620
to a three-hour fight and--
Are you smiling?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.873
No. In Spanish,
this look means, "I'm so sorry."

04:10.417 --> 04:12.294
-I bet you felt terrible.
-Totally.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.380
But I got her this for her birthday
and I wanted to see what you thought.

04:15.464 --> 04:16.589
This is our first date.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.591
It's like one of
the happiest days of my life.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.385
I know it's not a great picture of her.

04:20.469 --> 04:21.803
I mean, she's about to sneeze.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.055
But to me, it says,

04:23.138 --> 04:25.098
"You look great even
when you don't look great."

04:27.476 --> 04:28.685
She'll love it, right?

04:30.729 --> 04:31.897
I think it's awesome.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.192
So, you didn't tell Chad
that his gift was crap?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.443
Hey, hey.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.529
Watch your language around Mínimo.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.905
Why would I tell him that?

04:40.864 --> 04:42.991
I may have been more naive back then,

04:43.075 --> 04:45.953
but I'd already decided
to go after what I wanted.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.706
And now that I knew that Chad was about
to dig his hole deeper with Julia,

04:50.207 --> 04:51.792
this was my chance to go big

04:51.875 --> 04:55.546
and do something for her
that would finally win her over.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.339
But I had to act fast.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.549
Julia!

04:58.632 --> 05:00.217
Hi, Máximo!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.218
I missed you.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.636
Me too.

05:02.678 --> 05:05.055
I mean, I didn't miss me, I missed you!

05:05.681 --> 05:07.057
How was your trip with Chad?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.184
Not as good as expected.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.144
Oh no, what happened?

05:11.520 --> 05:12.145
Well…

05:13.021 --> 05:13.981
Chad.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.775
He's so sweet, but sometimes I feel like…

05:18.026 --> 05:20.737
like he doesn't see me for who I am.

05:21.530 --> 05:22.573
How couldn't he see you?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.992
You are… Julia González Padilla!

05:25.242 --> 05:26.535
The Princess of Medellin.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.497
Speaking of princesses,
I saw you with a pretty blonde yesterday.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.458
I'm happy for you.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.752
Tell me, tell me everything.

05:40.174 --> 05:40.883
Oh, my bad!

05:41.675 --> 05:42.634
It's ok, don't worry about it.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.512
Oh you want to know about Becca?

05:46.013 --> 05:46.722
She…

05:47.014 --> 05:48.432
She was just a guest.

05:48.724 --> 05:49.892
Was she pretty? I didn't notice.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.686
You didn't notice because
you were hugging her too closely.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.731
I should go back to work.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.608
I'm happy you are back!

05:57.774 --> 05:58.650
I'm happy too.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.778
Hey, Memo.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.739
One of your sisters
is a seamstress, right?

06:03.822 --> 06:04.823
Two of them are.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.242
And two more are apprentices to those two.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.287
Then the last one, the youngest
and prettiest, is a nun.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.497
Do you think they can make
a dress in one night?

06:12.581 --> 06:14.333
It's Julia's birthday tomorrow.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.085
And for her gift, I want to have
one of her dresses made,

06:17.169 --> 06:19.880
and make it look like a real dress
she could sell in the store

06:19.963 --> 06:22.090
with a designer tag and everything.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.720
I'm so proud of you.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.182
You're finally going after Julia.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.563
Diane, if you wanted
a hot tub in your office,

06:36.647 --> 06:38.232
there are easier ways.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.359
Not funny.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.778
You're lucky you weren't
sitting at your desk.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.864
I know. I had just left
to use the hot tub.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.534
How could one small earthquake
cause this much damage?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.452
Didn't the last owner keep
everything up to code?

06:50.536 --> 06:53.455
Well… he did meet
with the government inspector.

06:53.539 --> 06:57.167
There are leaks in the piping,
mold in the drywall…

06:57.209 --> 06:58.710
and one small earthquake could…

06:58.752 --> 07:01.338
make the hot tub fall through
to the rooms below them.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.508
I have no choice but to tell you that--

07:08.136 --> 07:10.764
Your resort has passed its inspection.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.643
So you're telling me my beautiful exterior

07:14.726 --> 07:17.604
is really just hiding massive decay
and rot on the inside?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.274
Well,

07:20.357 --> 07:21.692
I'm talking about the hotel.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.319
Yes. Yes, it is.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.282
I can't let Las Colinas fall apart.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.868
It's what makes me special.
What other problems are there?

07:30.951 --> 07:34.788
Well, I'll conduct a survey now
and review it with you tomorrow.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.165
But I must warn you,

07:37.249 --> 07:39.001
there will be a lot to see.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.628
So wear comfortable shoes.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.090
I will do no such thing.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.304
That afternoon at the pool,

07:50.387 --> 07:53.140
I heard something that would
change my family's life forever.

07:54.016 --> 07:57.728
-And a virgin daiquiri.
-Virgin daiquiri?

07:58.228 --> 08:00.272
Come on, Dr. Espinoza.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.899
Live a little, man.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.903
You see, Dr. Montez and Dr. Winsberg,

08:05.986 --> 08:08.989
they perform surgeries
on hips and shoulders.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.617
They get to be sloppy.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.119
Not me. I operate on eyes.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.955
Was the doctor's first name
Mariano?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.416
Was he the one that sent you the letter?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.336
No. Wrong.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.713
Héctor.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.424
Did I hear that man say
he performs eye surgeries?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.676
Yes. They say he's one of Mexico City's

08:29.760 --> 08:32.221
very, very, very, very
best ophthalmologists.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.476
Sorry, the way you said that word--
It was beautiful.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.604
Well, you should
hear me say radio telescope.

08:40.687 --> 08:44.900
Or Styrofoam. Or eczema.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.821
Microwave. Aluminum foil.

08:49.905 --> 08:53.742
Exhaust pipe. Risotto. Cosmopolitan.

08:53.825 --> 08:57.663
Hypoglycemia. Vertigo.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.916
Sweater vest. Hot cereal. Concussion.

09:00.999 --> 09:04.461
Shish kebab. Fumigate. Roast beef.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.964
Bar mitzvah. Heatstroke.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.883
Ringworm. Cincinnati. The Flintstones.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.178
Arranged marriage.
Cheez Whiz. Rice-A-Roni.

09:13.262 --> 09:16.181
Uvula. Stockholm syndrome.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.393
So what are you doing in my area?

09:20.227 --> 09:23.146
Héctor, was there a strong breeze?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.398
No, why?

09:24.481 --> 09:27.526
It's just your hair. It's kind of poofy.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.863
No. Poofy like yours?

09:31.446 --> 09:34.283
Yes. But worse. It's uneven.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.410
So exactly like yours.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.789
Maybe they sell mousse
in the gift shop.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.504
Gentlemen, I'm Máximo,

09:47.588 --> 09:49.715
and I'll be taking over as your server.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.973
Sarape! Are you awake?

09:58.307 --> 09:59.099
No.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.144
You're not gonna believe it!

10:02.227 --> 10:04.188
There's an eye doctor
staying at the resort.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.773
I need your help
getting Mom there tomorrow.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.817
Maybe he can examine her.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.860
Amazing!

10:10.277 --> 10:12.946
Oh, but can it be another day?
Gabriela and I have plans tomorrow.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.781
I think the doctor is leaving tomorrow.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.491
Mom won't go without you.

10:17.201 --> 10:19.870
Actually, Gabriela just gave me
a book about socialism.

10:20.329 --> 10:24.291
Maybe I can talk to some of the workers at
Las Colinas and help them unionize.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.793
That would really impress Gabriela.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.631
But of course…

10:30.714 --> 10:33.967
I'm doing it for the workers!

10:37.930 --> 10:39.014
You really like...

10:40.098 --> 10:41.433
spending time with Gabriela.

10:42.267 --> 10:42.935
Right?

10:48.232 --> 10:48.815
Yes.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.028
I really do.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.802
Mom, guess what?

11:17.427 --> 11:20.597
There's an oftha, there's an oftha…

11:22.307 --> 11:23.517
an oftha…

11:23.851 --> 11:25.310
oftha…

11:26.311 --> 11:27.437
An eye doctor!

11:27.563 --> 11:29.147
And he's staying at the resort and--

11:29.273 --> 11:32.109
No. No way I'm setting foot in that hotel.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.151
Mom,

11:33.986 --> 11:37.239
when will we ever get the chance for
such an important doctor to examine you?

11:37.990 --> 11:40.158
This is not about Las Colinas,
it's about your eyesight.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.535
That's right!

11:42.077 --> 11:44.997
I'm tired of feeling
like the "poor blind mom."

11:45.914 --> 11:47.916
I won't be a burden to you.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.752
I got a part-time job at the market,

11:50.836 --> 11:52.462
and applied to another one
at the butcher shop.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.175
I'm not sure if working with big knives
is the best idea right now.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.885
Nonsense. There is nothing I can't do.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.595
I'm a strong hardworking woman!

11:59.803 --> 12:01.930
I've raised two kids
and supported this home.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.807
I've given you shelter, food,
an education.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.058
Everything on my own!

12:05.267 --> 12:06.435
Yes, you did.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.520
You've been the best mom!

12:09.980 --> 12:11.440
But you'll be a grandmother someday.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.318
Wouldn't you like to be able
to see your grandchildren?

12:19.907 --> 12:20.824
Come to the resort today.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.826
Meet this doctor.

12:22.993 --> 12:26.371
Then maybe you'll never have to feel
like the "poor blind mom" again.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.166
Fine.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.919
I'll go to Las Colinas.
To see that

12:31.960 --> 12:33.504
…ophthalmologist.

12:34.838 --> 12:35.631
Show off.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.010
Julia! Happy Birthday.

12:40.052 --> 12:40.969
Thank you.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.471
Were you in a hurry to congratulate me,

12:42.513 --> 12:43.764
or do you want something from me?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.265
I was in a hurry to congratulate you.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.143
But now that you mention it…

12:48.560 --> 12:51.688
there is an eye doctor staying here
who could help my mom.

12:52.022 --> 12:55.400
Would you give me two day passes so my
mom and sister can talk to him?

12:55.859 --> 12:58.403
Máximo, I'm sorry but Chad
is in charge of day passes.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.906
He usually needs two days
notice to issue them.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.241
The doctor leaves today…

13:02.282 --> 13:04.117
Mom and my sister are waiting outside.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.786
You could try.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.413
But don't tell him that
they are for your mom to talk to a guest.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.831
You could get fired.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.501
I'm sure I can convince Chad.

13:12.835 --> 13:13.710
We are horses.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.880
No. I can't do it.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.216
But we're horses. Just this once.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.302
-It's so important. You have to help me.
-Look, I can't break any more rules.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.137
I'm already on thin ice with my mom.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.348
In fact, thin ice is
a pretty good way to describe her.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.559
Please, Chad, I'm running out of time.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.893
There's gotta be a way?

13:29.977 --> 13:32.020
I'm sorry, amigo. I can't help you.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.565
Since Chad
refused to do anything,

13:34.648 --> 13:37.276
I decided I had to take matters
into my own hands.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.486
This was too big an opportunity
for my mother.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.016
And we'll need to have
an engineer look at the foundation.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.893
This is gonna cost a fortune.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.228
Hey, is that retaining wall
supposed to be dripping?

14:15.397 --> 14:18.275
God, I hate these shoes.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.498
Is that a nude woman over there?
I think I saw her breasts!

14:33.540 --> 14:36.251
Mom, calm down.
That's an old man in swim shorts.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.086
Don't tell me to calm down.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.255
I've seen what this

14:40.672 --> 14:42.508
horrible place does to people.

14:43.509 --> 14:44.843
People who I used to admire.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.346
Everything about this place is awful.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.058
Mmm, delicious.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.435
Okay.
I just seated the doctors over there.

14:53.852 --> 14:54.853
Let's go talk to them, then.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.396
We can't just do that!

14:56.480 --> 14:57.731
They're very important doctors.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.275
No, they're people just like us.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.151
You're so immature.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.569
You're so immature.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.488
We can't just go talk to them like that!

15:04.821 --> 15:06.490
But I already have the perfect plan.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.868
First, you two stand close to them.
And then…

15:10.118 --> 15:12.496
Sara, you're going to
look up at the sky and point.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.874
Then you'll say
something totally natural, like:

15:15.999 --> 15:16.667
Mother,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.794
behold that majestic eagle

15:19.127 --> 15:22.381
soaring up above, with the sun dancing
on its mighty wings.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.342
No wait, it has to be something
more impactful for the doctor to notice.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.927
Maybe something like…

15:27.553 --> 15:29.721
Holy shit, look at that bird!

15:30.389 --> 15:32.182
Then, Mom will answer you:

15:32.599 --> 15:33.475
Dear child,

15:33.642 --> 15:35.769
I cannot see any beauty in this world,

15:35.894 --> 15:37.938
with these poor eyes of mine.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.566
If only there was an ofta-- ophtal--

15:41.149 --> 15:41.775
ofta-- ophtal--

15:42.192 --> 15:43.110
ofta-- ophtal--

15:43.902 --> 15:46.864
A great eye doctor who could help me!

15:48.490 --> 15:49.867
Wait, where did they go?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.746
Look up…

15:57.541 --> 15:59.960
These cataracts are pretty advanced…

16:00.836 --> 16:02.754
But fortunately,
"Medical Weekly" just named me

16:02.838 --> 16:04.798
the best ophthalmologist
in all of North America.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.385
I have some basic diagnostic tools
in my room.

16:08.927 --> 16:09.636
Let's head upstairs,

16:09.887 --> 16:11.430
so I can further examine you.

16:11.513 --> 16:15.184
Are you saying… there's a chance she'll
get her full vision back?

16:17.186 --> 16:18.604
There's a very good chance.

16:19.188 --> 16:21.106
That's more than I let myself hope for.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.776
I owe it all to…

16:26.320 --> 16:26.737
to…

16:30.199 --> 16:31.491
Doña Rosita!

16:32.618 --> 16:34.661
I knew the limpia would work.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.330
Let's go, Doctor.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.208
If you'll excuse me.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.294
What are you all doing here?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.838
Memo, you scared me.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.049
No one can know
about my mom and sister being here.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.467
Okay!

16:48.717 --> 16:50.135
Is there anything I can do for you?

16:50.260 --> 16:50.719
Yes!

16:51.178 --> 16:54.139
Actually Memo, while Máximo escorts mom
to the doctor's room…

16:54.473 --> 16:58.310
maybe you can show me places
at the resort with a lot of workers?

16:58.352 --> 16:59.853
Sure. I'd love to.

16:59.895 --> 17:00.562
Thanks!

17:01.063 --> 17:03.023
Your little sister clearly
has a crush on me.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.398
It's so cute.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.568
Mom, I'll meet you back here
in fifteen minutes.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.948
And wait till she sees where I work.
She's going to be so impressed.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.454
So here's where I work.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.205
I know…Impressive.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.165
But don't let that intimidate you.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.294
Oh look over there,
I once saw a rat eating another rat.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.253
It was thrilling.

17:28.339 --> 17:28.799
Hi!

17:30.717 --> 17:33.720
I'm here to help workers
and tell them about socialism.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.432
That's wonderful!

17:38.141 --> 17:41.436
Us workers need a lot of help!

17:42.855 --> 17:44.857
It's a shame I can't help you out

17:44.940 --> 17:45.649
because

17:45.816 --> 17:47.901
I must fold all these towels.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.322
We can fold them together
while I tell you about it.

17:52.698 --> 17:54.324
Thank you, sweetheart.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.577
Where are the linens you were bringing?

17:56.618 --> 17:57.411
Hurry!

18:01.748 --> 18:04.251
The problem is
that people are being exploited,

18:04.334 --> 18:06.211
and they don't even realize it.

18:13.302 --> 18:14.469
Here's my phone number.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.680
We'll get your mom in
for surgery very soon,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.807
and we'll figure out the payment plan.

18:19.558 --> 18:20.434
Thank you so much, Doctor!

18:21.268 --> 18:24.313
I promise you, you'll have your eyesight
back in time for the new year.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.023
God bless you!

18:26.356 --> 18:27.232
Take care.

18:27.482 --> 18:28.025
Thanks.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.487
I owe all this to just one person.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.489
Doña Rosita, I know.

18:34.698 --> 18:35.574
No my love.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.036
This is all thanks to you!

18:40.120 --> 18:44.082
You never give up,
especially when it comes to family.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.504
You get that from me.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.393
I'm just happy you'll get to see again.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.355
I have to go, Mom.

19:06.647 --> 19:08.315
But wait here for Sara, okay?

19:08.357 --> 19:09.441
Yes, love.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.068
I love you.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.028
I love you too, son.
Thank you!

19:15.531 --> 19:17.449
Helping my mother
regain her vision

19:18.200 --> 19:20.702
was one of the proudest
moments of my life.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.916
Hi, Mom!

19:27.209 --> 19:30.587
Of course, that was just one
of two big events that afternoon.

19:30.671 --> 19:32.297
Right. The dress.

19:32.965 --> 19:34.508
This is gonna be great.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.645
Yeah! Let's blow
out those candles.

19:46.728 --> 19:49.398
-Happy birthday, sweetie.
-We're not done yet.

19:50.566 --> 19:51.733
So what do you think?

19:52.568 --> 19:54.027
The cake looks good.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.529
I think I'll have a small piece.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.239
No, about the resort.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.825
This whole place will fall apart
if we don't move soon.

19:59.908 --> 20:03.161
I won't lose Las Colinas.
I can't go back to what I was.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.664
Let's speed up the renovation plans.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.959
We're talking a lot of money.
It will be challenging.

20:09.918 --> 20:14.464
Please. I moved three million units
of an exercise tape on Betamax.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.592
Here's what we're going to do:

20:16.675 --> 20:19.887
We'll contact our short list
of potential investors,

20:19.970 --> 20:23.140
we'll invite them to
a New Year's Eve at Las Colinas

20:23.223 --> 20:24.892
that they'll never forget.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.311
-I'll start getting a list together.
-Thank you.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.567
Cake does look good.

20:34.318 --> 20:37.321
…and that's why I think a peaceful strike
would be a really good idea.

20:40.324 --> 20:43.535
I don't think I quite understand it, doll.

20:43.911 --> 20:47.289
Explain it to me one more time,
while we finish here.

20:49.124 --> 20:49.750
Okay.

20:51.585 --> 20:54.463
So the capitalists control
the means of production.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.133
Are you following?

21:03.555 --> 21:05.349
Did you give her my dress yet?

21:05.432 --> 21:07.851
-Your dress?
-I put a lot into this.

21:08.852 --> 21:11.271
Don't worry, you haven't missed anything.

21:11.355 --> 21:15.150
Okay, babe,
I did get you a birthday gift.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.820
And I hope you love it
as much as I do.

21:18.904 --> 21:20.405
Baby.

21:21.365 --> 21:25.160
"And I love it a lot.
Because it's a picture of myself."

21:25.244 --> 21:26.537
Anyways, here it is.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.877
This is so funny.
Look at her face.

21:33.961 --> 21:37.130
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

21:37.965 --> 21:39.883
This is my pattern from my own design!

21:39.967 --> 21:41.260
I know! And it's even got your little--

21:41.343 --> 21:43.428
your little name tags
like it's your own clothing brand.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.430
-What do you think?
-This is the most thoughtful thing…

21:45.514 --> 21:47.516
…anybody has ever done.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.312
-What?
-What? Chad stole your gift?

21:53.730 --> 21:54.982
No.

21:55.649 --> 21:58.777
I might have just left out
a few details from the story.

22:00.404 --> 22:01.613
There's gotta be a way.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.824
I'm sorry, amigo. I can't help you.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.745
Chad?

22:10.998 --> 22:14.418
What if I told you I can get you
something in exchange for the passes?

22:14.501 --> 22:15.586
Something you need.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.629
What do you have that I need?

22:18.547 --> 22:20.299
I know you really care about Julia.

22:20.799 --> 22:24.094
I also know that she's gonna
hate the gift you got her.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.973
She's already worried
that you don't really see who she is.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.975
That photo plays right into that.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.190
If you get me those passes,

22:37.149 --> 22:39.276
I'll give you something to give to Julia.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.905
Something so thoughtful and so special,

22:43.989 --> 22:48.285
I guarantee you,
it will sweep her off her feet.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.915
By giving that gift to Chad…

22:59.171 --> 23:01.131
I was letting go
of the best hope

23:01.215 --> 23:05.636
I had to win over the woman I loved.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.180
Thank you so much.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.600
But I knew it was
the right decision.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.898
Why would you do that? You let Chad win.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.485
I did it because of this.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.406
She did get to see you, Hugo.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.576
Just like I promised her she would.

23:30.953 --> 23:34.081
And she's gotten to keep watching
you grow up all these years.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.000
And that has meant the world to her.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.211
And me.

23:43.006 --> 23:46.802
And so, yes,
it was hard to give up the dress.

23:49.263 --> 23:51.223
But I know I did the right thing for her.

23:51.306 --> 23:53.267
It was the right thing for all of us.

23:53.350 --> 23:56.854
Sara. Sarape. You're early.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.565
Well, I couldn't wait
to see my birthday boy.

23:59.648 --> 24:01.024
Hi.

24:01.942 --> 24:04.862
You know, I'm glad your uncle's
telling you this story.

24:04.945 --> 24:07.906
What he did that day,
I couldn't be prouder.

24:09.074 --> 24:12.035
He was so kind, so selfless.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.162
Too bad he didn't stay that way.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.455
Oh here we go again…

24:15.497 --> 24:16.373
What?

24:16.456 --> 24:19.585
I mean-- I care
about social justice as much as you do.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.670
-You own 50 companies…
-Sixty-three.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.964
…and you think that "giving back"
is donating to celebrity causes.

24:24.047 --> 24:24.882
Sixty-three.

24:24.965 --> 24:27.301
Help people!
Why do you need so much money?

24:27.342 --> 24:29.011
Do you know how expensive it is
to maintain my island?

24:29.386 --> 24:30.679
My cars maintenance?

24:30.721 --> 24:31.471
You're so immature!

24:31.680 --> 24:32.472
You're so immature!

24:33.307 --> 24:34.600
You two guys, stop it.

24:34.683 --> 24:35.684
She started it.

24:35.767 --> 24:39.021
Okay. Finish telling
your story so we can have dinner.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.147
She started it.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.774
I don't care who started it. Come on.

24:44.193 --> 24:46.945
So tell me, you gave up
any hope with Julia

24:47.029 --> 24:49.031
so that Grandma
could have her vision back?

24:49.114 --> 24:51.033
Well, not quite.

24:51.825 --> 24:54.870
See, things
weren't over with Julia.

24:54.953 --> 24:58.040
Not yet. That's the thing about life.

24:58.582 --> 25:00.834
It circles back in mysterious ways.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.921
Doors close and then reopen.

25:04.755 --> 25:07.216
And just when you thought
they were gone forever,

25:07.883 --> 25:12.804
people you lost long ago,
they have a way of showing up again.

25:12.888 --> 25:13.931
Nora Ramos?

25:16.225 --> 25:18.143
It's been a very long time.
