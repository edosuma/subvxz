WEBVTT

00:02.785 --> 00:04.439
Previously onDynasty...

00:04.482 --> 00:06.919
DEBRA :
There doesn't seem
to be any friction.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.921
Well, we've known each other
our entire lives.
Yeah.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.489
I've always had a crush on him.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.795
Marry me again.
Hell yes.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.580
Are you sure this will work?

00:15.624 --> 00:16.842
Framing Adam for my murder?

00:16.886 --> 00:17.930
They'll never see it coming.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.236
The police will find evidence

00:19.280 --> 00:21.717
that Adam was involved
in my disappearance.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.371
Jeff won't be a problem anymore.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.590
BLAKE:
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

00:25.634 --> 00:26.939
When I heard
you'd bought a hotel,

00:26.983 --> 00:28.463
I thought even you
couldn't be that careless.

00:28.506 --> 00:31.292
Careless? I'm all about caring.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.336
When I was 16,

00:32.380 --> 00:33.337
I got into a fight.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.904
We were both really drunk.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.036
It was all a blur.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.388
I hired these guys
to find Fallon's ring

00:40.431 --> 00:41.432
that she dropped in the lake.

00:41.476 --> 00:42.433
She told me the truth.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.913
I guess there's no question

00:43.956 --> 00:47.351
as to which child
he should side with now.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.095
FALLON:
I figured it out.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.575
Culhane already got rid
of the bag of money,

00:53.618 --> 00:55.011
so you won't
be getting away with this.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.013
Michael Culhane.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.841
We're placing you
under arrest.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.414
I sold Femperial
to Kirby for one dollar.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.893
And she's gonna
sell it back to me.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.156
Actually, I'm not selling.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.244
What?
ANDERS:
I'm sorry about the timing.

01:10.287 --> 01:12.115
I'm out,
effective immediately.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.161
You're not gonna believe this,
but we got a second body.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.206
Not much to go by.
It's a young female.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.686
Wonder who that could be.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.122
There's still a gold bracelet
around the wrist.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.863
Trixie!Trixie.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.823
DOUG: Another day in the life
of Carrington craziness

01:24.867 --> 01:27.826
as scenes of drama and trauma
are unfolding

01:27.870 --> 01:29.350
at Carrington Manor
in Atlanta today.

01:29.393 --> 01:32.004
Sources tell me not one
but two bodies have been pulled

01:32.048 --> 01:33.441
from the lake
on the family's property,

01:33.484 --> 01:35.138
including that
of a teenage girl.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.796
Fallon Carrington's on-again,
off-again boy toy, Liam Ridley,

01:40.839 --> 01:44.365
aka author Johnny Southside,
aka Jack Lowden,

01:44.408 --> 01:47.672
is in critical condition after
a narrow escape from drowning.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.936
Ex-Carrington chauffeur
Michael Culhane

01:50.980 --> 01:53.983
was arrested just hours ago
for bribing a senator.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.593
Plus, Carrington cousin
Jeff Colby

01:55.637 --> 01:57.117
has been reported missing,

01:57.160 --> 01:59.858
possibly the victim
of foul play.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.556
The scrutiny couldn't come
at a worse time,

02:01.599 --> 02:04.254
with the Carrington Foundation
fund-raiser tomorrow night

02:04.298 --> 02:05.777
at the Georgia Aquarium.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.301
Talk about sleeping
with the fishes.

02:07.344 --> 02:08.911
FALLON: Will someone
please get this jackass

02:08.954 --> 02:10.565
away from our gate?

02:10.608 --> 02:12.088
Fallon, I...Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.176
Save it, Cristal.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.744
You've already apologized twice.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.093
You think the third time's
a charm?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.877
I hope so.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.183
Not today, lady.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.663
Who is he on
the phone with?
His lawyer.

02:21.706 --> 02:22.881
Where did Sam and Kirby go?

02:22.925 --> 02:24.013
ANDERS:
Kirby went to
visit Culhane

02:24.056 --> 02:26.233
after you and Blake
had him arrested.

02:26.276 --> 02:29.540
Sam is tending
to his hotel.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.935
Perhaps next time you consider
dredging the lake, you'll speak

02:32.978 --> 02:35.111
to your father first.I didn't dredge the lake.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.765
I hired two divers...

02:36.808 --> 02:38.201
The lawyers are
on their way over, which means

02:38.245 --> 02:40.334
so are the detectives, which
means we need to talk fast.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.422
FALLON:
Oh, I'm fine.

02:41.465 --> 02:42.597
Thank you for asking.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.120
I just watched
my friend's corpse

02:44.164 --> 02:45.600
get dragged out of our lake

02:45.643 --> 02:47.732
and found out that my fiancé
drowned and would have died

02:47.776 --> 02:49.212
if Tony the gardener
hadn't taken

02:49.256 --> 02:51.736
his fourth break of the day
and found him in time.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.608
And I still don't know
how he is, but by all means,

02:53.651 --> 02:54.739
let's have a family meeting.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.741
I know, you had a
bad day. We all did.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.526
But the police are gonna
want to interview all of us,

02:58.569 --> 03:00.005
and we need to get
our stories straight.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.398
I don't have a story.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.226
Trixie fell,
and I went to Anders for help.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.576
I was 16. He told me
he would take care of it.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.970
I didn't know that meant
throwing her body in the lake.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.670
You did it?

03:12.714 --> 03:14.585
You said you had
nothing to do with that one.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.109
I didn't think it was
the best time to explain.FALLON: You know what?

03:17.153 --> 03:19.111
I'm not even surprised.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.418
I did what I had to do.
And I'm curious,

03:21.462 --> 03:23.855
what did you think
happened to Trixie, huh?

03:23.899 --> 03:25.422
Think she just ran off to Spain?

03:25.466 --> 03:29.165
No. I-I just... I just figured
she got hurt really badly

03:29.209 --> 03:31.428
and, I don't know,
was recovering in...

03:31.472 --> 03:32.560
a secret hospital of ours.
I don't know.

03:32.603 --> 03:33.648
I tried not to think about it.

03:33.691 --> 03:34.953
What do we say about
the other body?

03:34.997 --> 03:36.433
Mack? We say nothing.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.261
Nobody knows how he got there.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.089
ANDERS:
Officially, he
did work for us

03:40.132 --> 03:41.351
as a security consultant.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.613
Some of the staff
might remember.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.136
Oh, it was ten years ago.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.877
But there could be
DNA evidence on him.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.270
Why don't we
tell the police

03:47.314 --> 03:49.446
Mack attacked you
and it was self-defense?

03:49.490 --> 03:52.144
You're responsible
for Mack, too?

03:53.711 --> 03:55.235
How many bodies
are in that lake?

03:57.889 --> 03:59.108
I'm responsible for nothing.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.328
Mack was an ex-con
who probably had

04:01.371 --> 04:03.286
more enemies than I do.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.288
And as far as Trixie goes, we
stick with the original story.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.072
Does everybody got that?FALLON:
Yes.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.857
We were close friends...

04:08.900 --> 04:10.250
...who went
to high school together.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.599
Trixie visited
the manor quite often,

04:11.642 --> 04:13.078
but I didn't know her well.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.864
I just found out who she was.
Such a tragedy.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.648
Her name was Trixie?

04:17.692 --> 04:21.304
She came over that night
to hang out and watch TV, but...

04:21.348 --> 04:23.611
As far as I can recall,
she only stayed a few hours.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.003
Mr. Carrington...

04:25.047 --> 04:26.701
...was out at a business meeting
most of the night.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.617
And then she got tired
and said she was going home.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.358
By the time I got back,
she had already...

04:31.401 --> 04:32.924
...left for the evening,
and that...

04:32.968 --> 04:35.100
...was the last time
I ever saw her.

04:35.144 --> 04:38.669
Mack? Yes, he may have done
a few odd jobs, but...

04:38.713 --> 04:40.671
He hadn't worked here
in about ten years.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.586
His name was Mack?

04:42.630 --> 04:44.196
I'm not familiar with it.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.938
No. No, I've never
heard that name before.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.897
But I just got here.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.246
BLAKE:
Thank you, Detective.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.336
We appreciate
all your hard work.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.121
Not just today, but always.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.428
You've been good friends.

04:58.472 --> 05:03.303
Which is why we so generously
donate to the policemen's fund.

05:03.346 --> 05:06.436
CULHANE:
Blake Carrington set me up.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.525
All I need is five minutes
to talk to Agent Tarkoff

05:08.569 --> 05:11.876
or anyone at the FBI.Tell the detective.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.923
I already did.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.968
And everyone else.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.145
All the Carrington money
and influence in the world

05:20.189 --> 05:22.278
cannot change the fact
that I am innocent.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.933
You believe me, right?

05:24.976 --> 05:26.282
Doesn't matter what I believe.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.906
ADAM:
I think it went pretty well.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.778
If everybody stayed
with the same story,

05:43.821 --> 05:45.214
you should be in the clear.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.651
Look, I'm not saying I didn't
make a mistake, but I...

05:48.652 --> 05:49.740
A mistake?

05:49.784 --> 05:51.002
Is that what
you're calling this?

05:51.046 --> 05:52.613
Father, let me explain.Explain what?

05:52.656 --> 05:53.918
For some insane reason,

05:53.962 --> 05:56.007
you hired divers
to find Fallon's ring.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.140
I didn't know there were
two bodies in the lake.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.316
Yeah? Well, maybe next time,
ask first.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.190
And I'm not in the clear until
that autopsy on Mack is done.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.409
I can fix it. I promise.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.106
Just give me a chance
to make it right.

06:08.150 --> 06:11.066
Absolutely not.
You have done enough.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.329
You stand down while I
figure out some way to make sure

06:13.373 --> 06:15.375
that my DNA is not all over
Mack's dead body.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.160
DOMINIQUE:
I told you the investigators

06:18.203 --> 06:20.684
wouldn't suspect
we had anything to do with it.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.339
That's the problem.
They don't suspect anything.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.123
Or anyone.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.864
We gave them every
piece of the puzzle

06:26.908 --> 06:28.300
to prove that
Adam killed Jeff.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.911
When are they gonna
bring him in?

06:29.954 --> 06:31.956
It hasn't even
been 24 hours.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.567
They may have found
the cuff link

06:33.610 --> 06:35.743
and heard about the fight
between Jeff and Adam,

06:35.786 --> 06:37.440
but they need time
to make a case.

06:37.484 --> 06:40.095
Mrs. Colby, have the police
opened an official investigation

06:40.138 --> 06:42.184
into your son's disappearance?
Do they think he's still alive?

06:42.227 --> 06:43.838
MONICA:
I'm out of here.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.448
It's Ms. Deveraux.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.928
Dominique Deveraux.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.582
And I'm sorry,
I can't discuss it. Not now.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.800
At least, not yet.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.891
I mean, it's all
just so horrific.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.372
Losing a child
is a mother's worst nightmare.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.075
If whoever hurt my son
is watching,

07:04.119 --> 07:06.208
just know that I,
Dominique Deveraux,

07:06.251 --> 07:09.080
will do everything in my power
to find him--

07:09.124 --> 07:11.735
to find you-- and then make sure

07:11.779 --> 07:14.738
you get the punishment
you deserve.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.784
I'm sorry, no more questions.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.829
I can't.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.969
What exactly was your plan?

07:28.012 --> 07:30.362
I'm just curious.Plan? What are you
talking about?

07:30.406 --> 07:32.103
Well, you somehow knew
that Trixie was in the lake,

07:32.147 --> 07:33.409
and you wanted
them to find her.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.324
Did you want them
to arrest me for murder?

07:35.367 --> 07:36.760
I was just trying
to find your ring.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.588
Oh, no one believes that.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.111
At least Blake hates you now.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.939
I heard him screaming
from across the house.

07:41.983 --> 07:45.290
Ah. Well, scream therapy can be
very effective for anxiety.

07:46.378 --> 07:47.336
Where are you going?

07:47.379 --> 07:48.424
Ooh, can I drive?No.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.470
Gonna see Liam?

07:50.513 --> 07:52.123
Is he awake yet?

07:52.167 --> 07:54.125
I don't know.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.866
That's why I'm going
to the hospital.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.042
You know, somehow, it
wouldn't surprise me

07:58.086 --> 08:00.088
if you were involved
with what happened to him, too.

08:00.131 --> 08:02.960
Fallon, I was standing by the
lake the entire time with you.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.833
Obviously, I had nothing
to do with Liam's accident.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.356
You know,
not everything's my fault.

08:07.399 --> 08:10.490
Whatever. Just know
I don't forget things.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.317
And you will pay,
eventually.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.493
For everything.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.626
Give him a big kiss for me.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.769
FALLON:
I had to tell them
the same thing

08:28.812 --> 08:30.292
I said ten years ago.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.903
Nothing good ever happens
when you change your story.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.252
Mmm.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.953
Listen, if you can hear me,

08:38.996 --> 08:41.564
I know you are
probably very sick

08:41.608 --> 08:43.479
of hearing me talk about Trixie.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.568
But it's not like there's
anything I could've done.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.614
You know? Even if I knew
what Blake did.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.093
I just wish he would've told me

08:49.137 --> 08:50.747
so I wouldn't have
wondered all these years.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.534
Ugh. Ugh. Coconut?

08:54.577 --> 08:57.058
I hate it when they don't give
you the little chocolate chart.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.847
I just want you to wake up
so we can be together again.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.377
I'll be back in the morning.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.039
Trixie?

10:00.295 --> 10:03.341
You can tell me the truth,
and I won't say a word.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.430
You swear you didn't push her?
Because 16-year-olds

10:05.474 --> 10:08.042
can be really bitchy sometimes.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.826
She was one
of my closest friends.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.698
And it's been
very traumatic for me,

10:11.741 --> 10:13.743
you know, having all these
feelings bubbling back up.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.179
So to speak.And...

10:15.223 --> 10:17.007
as if things
couldn't get any worse,

10:17.051 --> 10:20.489
I saw her when I was leaving
Liam's hospital room.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.926
Saw who?
Trixie.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.667
What? Are you serious?

10:24.711 --> 10:26.234
Like, what, back from the dead?

10:26.277 --> 10:27.627
No, no. Like a ghost.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.411
Except not, because she was
just sitting there

10:29.454 --> 10:30.542
and not really
doing anything.

10:30.586 --> 10:31.543
She was never very athletic.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.806
You know, may she rest in peace.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.198
Do you think she was trying
to talk to you?

10:34.242 --> 10:37.027
No. I said, "like a ghost,"
not an actual ghost.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.594
Right.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.987
Well, I guess
when you feel guilty

10:40.030 --> 10:41.031
about something,
your brain can,

10:41.075 --> 10:42.685
you know, mess with you.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.992
Whoa... Who said anything
about guilt?

10:45.035 --> 10:47.777
No. The only person who should
feel guilty is Blake.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.258
And I hope that not-ghost Trixie
is haunting him, too.

10:50.301 --> 10:52.652
Maybe she came to me
to try and find him.

10:52.695 --> 10:53.914
I just keep
thinking of how

10:53.957 --> 10:56.046
painful this must be
for her family.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.395
They must be going
through a lot.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.658
I know.
I wish there was something

10:58.701 --> 10:59.702
I could do to help them.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.443
Maybe that's why
she showed up.

11:01.486 --> 11:02.879
So you can help
her parents.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.577
I mean, can you imagine
how painful this whole thing

11:05.621 --> 11:06.796
must have been for them?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.711
And now that they've
finally got past it,

11:08.755 --> 11:12.193
they have to relive it?Well, you're not exactly
making me feel better.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.977
And the press is
probably hounding them.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.153
It just must
be... awful...

11:16.197 --> 11:17.981
Sam! Please! Stop talking.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.549
Okay, I am gonna go before you
make me feel any worse.

11:21.593 --> 11:22.682
And please don't demean yourself

11:22.725 --> 11:24.118
by choosing the one on the left.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.989
Well, it's my
hotel and...

11:26.033 --> 11:28.644
Well, that was my backup.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.734
BLAKE: I need to know
that you're on top of this.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.519
I pay you a lot of money
to be my lawyer.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.652
Make sure that I'm protected.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.264
I'll call you later.

11:40.308 --> 11:43.572
I need to lock
that door more often.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.923
Adam's safe. You're welcome.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.056
Well, don't act like
you're doing this

11:49.099 --> 11:50.405
purely out of kindness.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.668
Unless you don't want the money.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.279
Yeah.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.200
And Jeff?The less you know, the better.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.594
But I do have
a favor to ask.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.814
Other than the seven-figure
check I just handed you?

12:07.857 --> 12:08.945
That was a transaction.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.120
Ah.
Not a favor.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.121
And this won't cost you a thing.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.775
Mm, somehow I doubt that.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.473
It's been a while
since I left Atlanta.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.214
I'd like for you to use
tonight's event

12:17.258 --> 12:18.563
to reintroduce me to society.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.218
Sort of my new debut.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.398
Oh, I don't know how
to break this to you, Dominique.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.270
You haven't been 16
in a long time.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.100
But I've been a Carrington
all of my life.

12:34.841 --> 12:38.540
I'm not interested in making
tonight all about you.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.152
I don't trust you, Dominique,
so I'd rather keep

12:42.196 --> 12:43.763
as much distance
between us as possible.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.071
I think we're done here.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.945
I promise you we're not.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.643
You know that I'm
innocent, right?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.210
Yes. Of course.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.125
Blake basically confessed what
he did with the hidden money

12:58.168 --> 12:59.822
and the fake e-mails
to frame you.

12:59.866 --> 13:03.565
Fallon and I heard. That's
Blake Carrington for you.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.785
Always proud of his work.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.352
Well, Fallon and I
could go to the FBI

13:08.396 --> 13:09.789
and tell them
what we heard.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.486
Even though she's not
speaking to me.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.705
Will a blazer make me seem
like a credible witness?

13:13.749 --> 13:16.099
Unless you magically recorded
everything that you heard,

13:16.143 --> 13:17.231
it won't matter.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.667
It's all hearsay.

13:18.710 --> 13:19.799
Don't even waste your time.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.844
Well, what can I do, Michael?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.280
Please, I really want to help.

13:23.324 --> 13:24.542
Can I talk to
your lawyer?

13:24.586 --> 13:26.980
I already have.
The judge set bail.

13:27.023 --> 13:30.113
And with my assets tied up in
the Atlantix, I can't afford it.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.855
Okay, well... how much is it?

13:32.899 --> 13:34.726
A million.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.079
Whew. Okay.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.646
I don't think I can
put that on my card.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.126
But we will figure this out.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.825
When I set my sights on
something, I get it.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.000
Ask Fallon.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.958
You're pretty cute
when you're scrappy.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.134
Oh, this is nothing yet.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.791
We need to talk.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.445
I'm a bit busy right now,
but maybe later.

13:57.488 --> 13:58.838
I think now is better.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.622
Okay.

14:00.665 --> 14:04.104
Look, I'm really enjoying this
whole new tough Cristal vibe,

14:04.147 --> 14:05.409
but can we make this
quick? 'Cause I...

14:05.453 --> 14:07.281
What is your plan to fix
the problem you created?

14:07.324 --> 14:09.326
If you want your father
to forgive you,

14:09.370 --> 14:10.806
I hope you're doing
something about it.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.938
Well, actually,
Father specifically

14:11.981 --> 14:13.374
told me to stand down, so...

14:13.417 --> 14:15.071
Well, I'm telling you
to stand up.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.508
And act before it's too late.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.729
I don't think Blake would
appreciate you threatening me.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.123
I'm not.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.733
I'm just reminding you

14:24.776 --> 14:28.302
that I am the first person your
father talks to in the morning

14:28.345 --> 14:29.999
and the last one
at night.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.088
So he listens to me.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.440
So, what do you want me to do?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.965
Mack's body
has Blake's DNA on it.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.183
And maybe mine.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.881
You're a doctor.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.883
Figure it out.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.671
BLAKE:
We should talk next steps.

14:49.714 --> 14:50.977
Well, everything's
underway,

14:51.020 --> 14:52.587
so I'm doing a
full inventory

14:52.630 --> 14:53.893
so my replacement
will have

14:53.936 --> 14:55.851
all the information
he or she needs.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.679
Hold on. You were serious
about leaving?

14:57.722 --> 14:59.681
I thought that was just
a disgruntled employee,

14:59.724 --> 15:01.030
heat-of-the-moment thing.It was.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.163
But it's a moment
I don't regret.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.817
Well, you're just as involved
in this as I am.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.080
That body didn't
get dumped

15:07.123 --> 15:08.603
in the lake by itself.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.474
We need to find out
what's going on here.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.737
I'll reach out to our friends
in the police

15:12.781 --> 15:14.304
and see what information
they have

15:14.348 --> 15:15.827
and how they can
be of service.

15:15.871 --> 15:16.959
Good.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.918
But when that's
finished, so am I.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.485
I'm going to work for Sam
at the hotel.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.922
If we don't take care of this,

15:22.965 --> 15:24.706
the only place you're going
to be working is prison.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.751
As a prisoner.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.580
Yes, sir.
I got your meaning.

15:32.932 --> 15:33.933
Mm.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.673
Mrs. Tate?

15:35.717 --> 15:36.936
Hi.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.329
Fallon Carrington.

15:39.373 --> 15:40.983
It's been a
long time.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.725
I didn't know you were
a churchgoer now.Oh, no,

15:43.768 --> 15:45.335
I'm sure that church
would collapse

15:45.379 --> 15:48.860
into a cloud of bats
if I stepped one foot inside.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.688
And obviously,
you were being sarcastic.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.908
I see that now.So, why are you here?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.910
Well, I remembered that this
is where you would come

15:54.954 --> 15:57.130
with your family on Sundays,
so I wanted to find you

15:57.173 --> 15:58.609
and offer my condolences.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.569
About Trixie.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.006
Officially.
So... I'm sorry.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.139
I wish that were helpful.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.444
I'm sorry?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.664
Trixie's been gone ten years.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.145
Her disappearance
destroyed our family.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.234
Her father and
I got divorced.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.758
Her brother had
a terrible time after.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.978
And I'm still battling
vicious depression.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.068
So condolences
don't really help.

16:25.897 --> 16:26.986
Mrs. Tate?

16:27.029 --> 16:28.291
Mrs. Tate,
are you okay?

16:28.335 --> 16:30.598
I think you should leave.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.121
This isn't helping me,

16:32.165 --> 16:35.168
and this certainly
isn't helping Trixie.Mrs. Tate...

16:35.211 --> 16:37.039
I'm-I'm fine. Go.Y-You don't look fine.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.780
You look like you're about
to have a heart attack.

16:38.823 --> 16:42.044
Mrs. Tate! C-Can some...
can somebody call 911?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.741
Please? Help me.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.743
Please don't die.
Please don't die.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.664
I mean, she could have have just
told me it was a panic attack.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.014
Apparently, she gets
them all the time.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.580
But can you imagine
how nervous I was,

16:56.624 --> 16:58.278
standing there, wondering if
I had killed Trixie's mother?

16:58.321 --> 16:59.757
I do feel for you.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.237
Oh, come on, you
know what I mean.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.022
I can't have another Tate
death on my conscience.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.980
Why is it on your conscience?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.156
No, it's just an expression.
Doesn't mean anything.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.246
But it is weird that
she was found in your lake.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.336
I mean, it's not like she went
for a swim. She hated water.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.382
Remember?

17:17.558 --> 17:19.342
Uh...

17:19.386 --> 17:21.083
yes, Trixie's
mom is fine,

17:21.127 --> 17:23.085
and I was just trying to help.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.739
How are you doing with
the whole Jeff situation?

17:24.782 --> 17:26.871
Have you heard anything
from the police?

17:26.915 --> 17:29.309
DOMINIQUE:
We're hanging in there.

17:29.352 --> 17:33.878
Oh, if it isn't my famous
runaway half-aunt.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.097
I heard you were back.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.404
Yes, I am.
And it's been difficult,

17:37.447 --> 17:38.535
but we're still
holding out hope

17:38.579 --> 17:39.884
that they'll find Jeff.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.235
Were you holding out hope
at Saks?

17:42.278 --> 17:44.019
'Cause that coat
looks expensive.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.934
Listen, I would be grateful
if you would let me do

17:45.977 --> 17:47.283
something to help--
really, anything at all.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.025
Actually, we heard that Jeff
got into a huge fight

17:50.069 --> 17:52.158
earlier that day...DOMINIQUE: Monica.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.855
We don't need to involve Fallon.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.466
We have a police chief
in our family. Remember?

17:56.510 --> 17:58.512
Okay, then.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.123
Apparently,
we're fine for now.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.126
And what about Culhane?
Can you believe it?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.737
Between Trixie's skeleton
being found, Liam's injury

18:06.781 --> 18:09.088
and almost killing Mrs. Tate,
I honestly forgot.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.613
Okay, okay.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.918
I...

18:13.962 --> 18:14.963
I am gonna go.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.705
I will talk to you later.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.273
Okay.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.016
What's wrong with
pushing the investigation

18:25.060 --> 18:26.496
to move a little faster?

18:26.540 --> 18:29.238
The last thing we need
is Fallon sniffing around

18:29.282 --> 18:31.153
trying to figure out
what really happened.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.459
But she could...

18:32.502 --> 18:33.808
Trust me.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.984
I just set up an interview
to get the word out.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.029
It will be okay.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.561
What do you think?

18:49.302 --> 18:50.912
It's for the fund-raiser
tonight.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.914
You look amazing.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.004
But I was actually
wondering if, uh,

18:56.047 --> 18:57.527
you should consider
canceling it.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.878
You could still
wear this to dinner,

19:00.922 --> 19:03.142
or... not.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.622
We can't cancel it.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.797
It starts in five hours.

19:06.841 --> 19:07.972
Well, maybe we shouldn't go.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.192
Hmm? I mean, after
what happened,

19:10.236 --> 19:13.282
we don't need to be seen
in an aquarium with water.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.718
Might seem insensitive.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.503
It would be insensitive
for Blake Carrington

19:16.546 --> 19:17.895
not to bother showing up.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.507
The public needs to see
that everything's okay.

19:21.551 --> 19:22.857
You have nothing to hide.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.819
Yeah?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.386
Have you got a moment, sir?

19:31.692 --> 19:32.954
I'll go change.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.565
We need to be
wrinkle-free for tonight.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.177
Please tell me
you have good news.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.918
Well, only if you consider
no news good news, sir.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.007
Apparently, the police
consider this case so serious

19:43.051 --> 19:44.618
it's need-to-know only.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.663
Our contact has been
left in the dark.

19:46.707 --> 19:47.969
So you have nothing?

19:48.012 --> 19:49.623
The only thing I know
is that the coroner's exam

19:49.666 --> 19:50.711
is tomorrow morning,

19:50.754 --> 19:52.278
and that they're
watching you closely

19:52.321 --> 19:56.020
to see if you behave
differently, so act normal.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.239
Act normal?

19:57.283 --> 19:58.675
How am I supposed
to act normal

19:58.719 --> 20:00.329
when there's a body
in a morgue somewhere

20:00.373 --> 20:02.897
that could incriminate me?!

20:02.940 --> 20:04.986
Well, the first step
would be not screaming

20:05.029 --> 20:06.292
the word "incriminate," sir.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.816
That's why we pay lawyers.

20:08.859 --> 20:11.035
They help make evidence
disappear.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.776
Well, you need to pay
whoever you can

20:12.820 --> 20:16.040
in the Atlanta PD to find out
what else they've discovered.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.390
Ideally, something
of actual value.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.790
What's going on?

20:26.834 --> 20:30.707
Why is all my stuff
and Montgomery out here?

20:30.751 --> 20:32.361
I'm getting kicked out?

20:33.884 --> 20:36.496
Hey. Come back.
This is unacceptable.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.802
Oh, I assume
that this is your doing

20:38.846 --> 20:40.674
as payback for Femperial.

20:40.717 --> 20:43.024
Don't wave your rat at me.It's a wombat.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.418
Whatever. I know this may
come as a surprise to you,

20:45.461 --> 20:46.941
but I have other
things to do

20:46.984 --> 20:48.682
besides worry about your
living arrangements.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.336
Like helping
Culhane with bail.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.338
Well, let me
take that off your plate.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.904
Culhane doesn't want your help.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.603
He doesn't want my help, or you
don't want me to help him?

20:56.646 --> 20:59.214
Both. And he knows you
obviously forgot about him,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.912
so your name was left off
the visitor list.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.393
Look, I am not gonna sit here
and trade insults with you

21:04.437 --> 21:06.352
like we're 12 again
because, first of all,

21:06.395 --> 21:08.963
we're not 12, and second
of all, I would win.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.617
I just think it says
a lot that you would

21:10.660 --> 21:12.401
treat me like this after
everything I've done for you.

21:12.445 --> 21:13.402
After all you've done for me?

21:13.446 --> 21:15.404
Mm-hmm.
Um, sorry,
do you mean

21:15.448 --> 21:17.754
secretly trying to break up
my relationship

21:17.798 --> 21:20.322
or your family
getting Culhane arrested?

21:20.366 --> 21:21.497
I mean neither of those.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.020
You went back on our deal
with Femperial,

21:23.064 --> 21:24.500
which is hilarious,

21:24.544 --> 21:26.415
considering you have
about as much of a chance

21:26.459 --> 21:27.851
of successfully
running that company

21:27.895 --> 21:30.985
as I do of successfully running
a marathon in heels.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.334
Or ever.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.336
Well, we'll see about that.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.468
All right.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.209
Femperial, not the marathon.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.995
I see you two are
as tight as ever.

21:41.038 --> 21:43.824
She kicked me out.Oh, I think that was Blake.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.956
He's... :
"circling the wagons,"

21:46.000 --> 21:47.523
as he likes to say.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.656
You got somewhere to stay
until you find your own place?

21:49.699 --> 21:52.006
I know money's tight
at the moment, but...

21:52.049 --> 21:54.791
I'll be fine.
I own a publishing company now.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.838
But, um, you don't seem
very offended on my behalf.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.927
Getting away from the manor
will be the best thing

21:59.970 --> 22:01.102
that ever happened to you.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.018
This place is toxic.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.498
Hmm.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.282
And yet you're still here

22:07.326 --> 22:08.892
doing Blake's
bidding.

22:08.936 --> 22:11.068
You must really love
the taste of poison.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.515
Oh, no.

22:22.558 --> 22:23.777
I know you're
not really there.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.474
You're just in my mind.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.390
ASHLEY:
No, I'm actually here,
in the flesh.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.913
Oh, God.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.915
Ashley! What are
you doing here?

22:31.959 --> 22:33.439
How did you even find out
about this?

22:33.482 --> 22:35.266
Well, Laura called me.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.442
That's Liam's mom.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.052
Yes, I know who Laura is.Well, anyway,

22:38.095 --> 22:39.532
she's in Europe,
and she called me and asked

22:39.575 --> 22:41.403
if I would keep an eye
on her baby for her

22:41.447 --> 22:42.883
until she gets back.Why?

22:42.926 --> 22:45.538
Well, I guess because Liam and I
have been through a lot

22:45.581 --> 22:46.843
and will always
love each other.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.368
We have a very special bond.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.761
Yes, so do we.
It's called an engagement.

22:51.805 --> 22:55.112
Oh, interesting. I don't see
any rings on any fingers,

22:55.156 --> 22:57.201
but I do know how
you like to play

22:57.245 --> 22:59.378
with the truth
and then trample on it.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.381
Oh, okay.
I see what's going on here.

23:02.424 --> 23:03.947
Laura couldn't make it in person

23:03.991 --> 23:07.037
to annoy me and make this
traumatic experience even worse,

23:07.081 --> 23:09.388
so she sent her Mini-Me
to do the job for her.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.651
Look, I'm not here
to annoy anyone.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.479
I'm just worried.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.959
The doctors say they don't know
when he'll wake up.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.570
Yes, I know what
the doctors say.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.094
I have been in touch with
the doctors the entire time.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.400
Um, Ashley,

23:21.443 --> 23:23.445
you are no longer needed here.
You may go.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.273
ASHLEY:
Well,

23:25.316 --> 23:27.231
I was leaving anyway.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.409
Oh, please.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.198
I'll be right back.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.505
I just need to show the nurses
a photo of her

23:39.548 --> 23:41.332
so they can
shoot on sight.

24:09.796 --> 24:12.059
Just came to get my bag.

24:12.102 --> 24:14.540
Hello? Doctor?

24:14.583 --> 24:17.238
What are you doing here?

24:17.281 --> 24:19.632
Oh, my God.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.503
I knew you had something
to do with this.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.636
What were you gonna do? Smother
him to death? Pull the plug?

24:23.679 --> 24:25.464
Look...
No, stay away from me.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.162
Look, first of all,
Liam is not on a ventilator.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.729
Second of all, I was
just checking on him.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.731
I know how worried
you are, and, um,

24:31.774 --> 24:34.647
I just wanted to make sure that
he was being taken care of.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.387
I am a doctor.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.564
Well, maybe
we should call security.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.391
You know, just to be safe.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.091
Uh...

24:45.135 --> 24:46.528
Oh, it's just the lamp.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.226
Hey, I'm worried
about you.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.880
Clearly,
you've been through

24:50.924 --> 24:52.403
some serious trauma,
and I'm concerned

24:52.447 --> 24:55.102
that you're letting
your imagination run wild.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.323
Just go. Okay?

24:59.367 --> 25:02.370
And if I see you here again,
I am going to call the police.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.111
MONICA:
I really hope
both of those glasses

25:04.154 --> 25:05.416
aren't for you.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.375
Perfect timing.
My interview is about to start.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.377
Why is this so
important to you?

25:09.420 --> 25:12.119
It's not like we want anyone
to actually find Jeff,

25:12.162 --> 25:13.903
and you said it'll
take the police time

25:13.947 --> 25:15.383
to build a case against Adam.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.428
And they will. What better way
to put pressure on them

25:17.472 --> 25:18.778
than a grieving mother
doing an interview?

25:18.821 --> 25:20.301
Now, sit and have
a drink with me.

25:22.999 --> 25:25.001
Okay, it's time.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.134
Tonight, we're going away
from our usual programming

25:27.177 --> 25:29.092
so we can air a special
investigative piece

25:29.136 --> 25:30.529
on the Carrington family.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.226
From the beginnings
of the dynasty...Wait, what?

25:32.269 --> 25:34.445
You're kidding me.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.882
...to tonight's Carrington Gala.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.187
Did they just bump you?

25:37.231 --> 25:39.625
For that
"Drowning in the Lake Gala."

25:39.668 --> 25:42.323
The Carringtons are a big deal.
They always have been.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.673
It's hard to steal the
spotlight away from them.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.719
...tonight at
the Georgia Aquarium.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.644
See? This isn't
so bad, right?

25:58.687 --> 26:01.560
Actually, it does feel good
to be out in the world again.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.692
I just wish Anders would
get here with an update already.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.128
Henry.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.130
♪ Fascination
with your presentation ♪

26:07.174 --> 26:10.830
♪ Making me feel

26:10.873 --> 26:13.572

26:18.446 --> 26:20.753
Oh, no. I don't have time
for you right now.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.278
Pam, hello.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.412
Anything?

26:28.456 --> 26:31.677
No. I decided not to try.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.680
Excuse me?
I apologize, sir,

26:34.723 --> 26:37.117
but I told you I needed
to move on, and I do.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.814
In addition to which,

26:38.858 --> 26:42.035
you forced my daughter
out of the manor.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.211
That had nothing
to do with you.

26:44.254 --> 26:47.693
Even so, I'd be
a hypocrite to stay.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.477
I raised you.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.522
I watched you grow.

26:52.741 --> 26:55.135
But I'm done enabling you,
for both our sakes.

26:56.571 --> 26:59.095
If the police keep digging,
we could all end up in jail.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.882
I've decided to let the chips
fall where they may.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.928
Goodbye, sir,
and good luck.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.680
KIRBY:
They just kicked me out

27:18.724 --> 27:19.942
with no warning.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.291
I'm sorry.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.641
Guess this means
you're not going

27:22.684 --> 27:23.772
to the fund-raiser
tonight?

27:23.816 --> 27:25.687
No, that would
be weird,

27:25.731 --> 27:27.863
especially considering
it's already started.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.039
Well, me, neither,
out of solidarity.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.214
Aw, thank you.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.303
Speaking of
solidarity, um,

27:33.347 --> 27:35.131
I need somewhere to stay.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.959
If only I knew someone

27:37.003 --> 27:40.049
who owned a building
with, like, lots

27:40.093 --> 27:41.964
and lots of rooms,
like a hotel.

27:42.008 --> 27:44.706
We are obviously closed
for renovations.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.317
Why do you think I'm still
staying at the manor?
Yes.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.711
Sorry.Well, I'm not living
with my father.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.061
Why don't you just ask Culhane
if you can stay at his place?

27:52.105 --> 27:54.890
I mean, you're supposedly
his girlfriend, right?

27:54.934 --> 27:57.240
Mm.
And he's certainly
not using it.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.502
Yeah, maybe I will.

27:58.546 --> 28:00.766
Hmm.
Hmm.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.158
Hey, wait a second.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.551
You already weren't
going tonight

28:03.594 --> 28:05.509
before you knew I wasn't going.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.163
You're not sticking up
for me at all.

28:07.207 --> 28:10.036
Fine. I have...

28:10.079 --> 28:12.255
an irrational fear of fish.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.910
Okay?
I don't trust anything

28:14.954 --> 28:19.436
with eyes on both sides
of their head. It's a thing.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.873
Cool.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.275
No.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.561
FALLON:
Look, I know it sounds
a little crazy,

28:57.605 --> 29:00.042
but I think that you should
just confess about Trixie.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.610
I mean, it would be best
for everyone.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.351
What are they really gonna do
to you? You're Blake Carrington.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.353
Fallon,

29:06.396 --> 29:08.877
you've recently experienced
a lot of trauma...

29:08.921 --> 29:10.574
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

29:10.618 --> 29:12.141
I mean, aside from
the obvious reasons.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.013
Look, anyway, this has nothing
to do with that.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.884
I mean, we could get caught
at any minute.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.277
Somebody could go
to the police station

29:17.320 --> 29:18.844
and tell them what
they saw that night.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.759
I just have
a really bad feeling.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.761
Look, I understand
your concerns,

29:22.804 --> 29:24.240
but you need
to pull yourself together.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.895
We can talk about this later.
Now is not the time.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.854
Fine.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.059
Hey, Doc, I saw the lights on.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.408
You gonna be here late?

30:05.412 --> 30:06.979
Hmm.

30:36.399 --> 30:38.532
Sorry.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.099
Didn't mean
to scare you.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.449
Did Blake send you in here
to give me some words of wisdom

30:42.492 --> 30:44.190
about how we can't besmirch
the Carrington name?

30:44.233 --> 30:46.409
Admit nothing, deny everything?

30:46.453 --> 30:48.368
It was actually
my idea.
Ah.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.892
You have to know your father
was only trying to protect you.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.720
Oh, please.It's true.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.896
He told me you were a
little wild back then.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.593
Well, yeah.
I mean, that's what happens

30:56.637 --> 30:57.768
when your mother abandons you

30:57.812 --> 30:58.900
and your dad's
never home.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.033
Otherwise,
life can get pretty boring.

31:01.076 --> 31:04.514
So, if the police had gotten
involved in Trixie's death,

31:04.558 --> 31:06.386
your life would've
been ruined.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.866
You would've had no future.

31:07.909 --> 31:11.913
It may not have been
Blake's smartest move,

31:11.957 --> 31:14.350
but one family's life
was already ruined.

31:14.394 --> 31:17.876
He didn't think it would help
Trixie's family to ruin yours.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.145
DOMINIQUE:
What an honor to be here.

31:26.188 --> 31:29.800
Especially since my son,
Jeff Colby, was one of the first

31:29.844 --> 31:31.672
recipients
of this grant.

31:31.715 --> 31:32.891
He's missing now.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.370
Please keep him
in your prayers, Atlanta.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.719
Thank you.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.896
And thank you for supporting
my brother, Blake.

31:37.939 --> 31:40.811
Not only for the beautiful work
he does,

31:40.855 --> 31:42.552
but for what he's going through.

31:42.596 --> 31:46.295
I know it seems like
he must be guilty of something.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.734
But I don't think so,
and I'm glad you don't, either.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.606
That's true friendship.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.696
When everything points
to something nefarious,

31:55.739 --> 31:58.307
friends don't judge friends.

31:58.351 --> 31:59.961
People have died...

32:00.005 --> 32:01.528
Uh, that's enough,
Dominique.

32:01.571 --> 32:02.877
That's enough. Thank you.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.619
Thank you, Dominique. Yep.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.969
On a lighter note,
which isn't hard to hit

32:08.013 --> 32:09.318
after that performance,

32:09.362 --> 32:12.452
I would like to announce
the formation

32:12.495 --> 32:14.628
of the Trixie Tate Scholarship,

32:14.671 --> 32:17.718
which will be given annually
by this foundation.

32:19.328 --> 32:22.288
It will be to honor
my friend Trixie,

32:22.331 --> 32:24.464
who we lost ten years ago.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.379
The award will be given
to the student

32:26.422 --> 32:28.685
who best exemplifies
all the wonderful traits

32:28.729 --> 32:31.688
we loved so much in Trixie.

32:31.732 --> 32:35.562
It is my way of keeping
my friend's memory alive.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.738
And she's gone. She's g...

32:37.781 --> 32:39.131
She... And rest in peace.

32:39.174 --> 32:41.307
And...Thank you. Thank you, Fallon,

32:41.350 --> 32:43.048
for that-that lovely tribute.
But I think this crowd

32:43.091 --> 32:44.397
has heard enough
from the Carringtons

32:44.440 --> 32:45.615
for one evening.

32:45.659 --> 32:46.921
Don't you?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.444
Please enjoy yourselves.

32:48.488 --> 32:49.750
What is wrong with you?

32:49.793 --> 32:52.361
I thought it was a nice gesture.
And it worked.

32:52.405 --> 32:53.536
And you don't think
it makes you look

32:53.580 --> 32:54.798
just a little bit guilty?

32:54.842 --> 32:57.627
No. Actually, I feel great.

32:57.671 --> 32:59.716
Boop.

33:02.632 --> 33:03.807
What the hell was that?

33:03.851 --> 33:05.896
I'm just grateful
for all of the support.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.594
I know exactly what
you were doing.

33:07.637 --> 33:08.943
And if you ever try

33:08.987 --> 33:10.423
to embarrass Blake
like that again,

33:10.466 --> 33:12.077
you'll have to deal with me.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.165
That sounds like
a veiled threat.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.862
I should clarify.

33:14.905 --> 33:16.472
It's an explicit threat.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.952
Trust me.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.128
You don't want to mess
with my family.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.915
Culhane.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.134
Come with me.

33:26.178 --> 33:27.570
Is this about my bail?

33:27.614 --> 33:29.616
Doubtful. Agent Tarkoff is here
to talk with you.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.011
About what?About your charges.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.577
Come on. Let's go.

33:39.539 --> 33:42.063
Well?All taken care of.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.456
Really?

33:43.499 --> 33:46.981
Yes. Thanks to a clerical error
I may have caused,

33:47.025 --> 33:49.505
a certain body is on its way
to be cremated

33:49.549 --> 33:51.333
as we speak.That's great news.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.682
Should we toast?

33:52.726 --> 33:54.423
Maybe let's hold off
on the public celebration

33:54.467 --> 33:55.946
of destroying evidence.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.818
Fair enough.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.521
WOMAN :
Fallon.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.657
Fallon...

34:10.700 --> 34:13.442
Great. Now fish
are talking to me.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.316
Fallon.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.361
What? Seriously?

34:19.405 --> 34:21.015
I thought you were gone.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.244
What do you want?

34:32.287 --> 34:35.334
Simple. I want you to take
responsibility for what you did.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.900
Me? What did I do?

34:36.944 --> 34:39.294
I didn't even know that you
were in the lake, which...

34:39.338 --> 34:41.166
which I'm totally sorry
about, by the way.

34:41.209 --> 34:43.124
Stop blaming everyone else,
Fallon.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.126
You knew exactly
what happened to me.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.868
So, does this mean the
scholarship thing did not work?

34:47.911 --> 34:49.087
The scholarship was for you.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.566
Just like when
you went to my mom,

34:50.610 --> 34:54.135
and just like when you tried
to help Monica and Culhane.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.094
You're just trying
to make yourself feel better.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.272
I liked you better
when you were alive.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.624
You know what needs to be done.

35:13.198 --> 35:14.764
BLAKE:
Fallon?

35:15.765 --> 35:17.593
Aw. Need a hug?

35:29.997 --> 35:31.129
I'll use Femperial
to leverage the money

35:31.172 --> 35:32.173
to pay for your bail.

35:32.217 --> 35:33.914
I mean, I own it.
How weird is that?

35:33.957 --> 35:36.221
As long as you don't skip town
before the trial--

35:36.264 --> 35:39.572
and, uh, I mean,
you're not gonna skip town,

35:39.615 --> 35:41.400
right?

35:41.443 --> 35:45.795
Also, I need to ask you a favor,
which I know is kind of weird

35:45.839 --> 35:47.754
considering
the circumstances, but...

35:47.797 --> 35:50.583
Don't leverage
Femperial, Kirby.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.195
I don't want your
money or your help.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.893
What are you talking about?

35:56.937 --> 35:58.591
We spoke about this.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.158
I said I wanted to help,

36:00.201 --> 36:01.985
and you said
to figure out bail.I...

36:03.030 --> 36:04.423
I don't want
to owe you anything.

36:04.466 --> 36:07.339
Oh. You won't owe me
anything, Michael.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.167
If I do something
nice for you,

36:09.210 --> 36:10.820
it's because I care about you.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.172
Maybe you should care
a little less.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.178
I got to go.No, Michael.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.791
I-I'm just trying
to make this better for you.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.230
Fine.

36:29.274 --> 36:32.973
Have a great time
doing prison stuff.

36:40.807 --> 36:42.417
DOUG:
What's so urgent?

36:42.461 --> 36:45.246
What kind of story
do you have for me?

36:45.290 --> 36:48.771
The story is I paid you
a lot of money to interview me.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.338
Why the hell didn't it air?

36:50.382 --> 36:52.471
You're kidding, right?

36:52.514 --> 36:54.821
I just report the news.
I don't program it.

36:54.864 --> 36:55.952
That's above
my pay grade.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.824
Oh. So, who shall I call, then?

36:57.867 --> 36:59.347
Your boss?

36:59.391 --> 37:02.568
Tell them you took my payoff
but failed to follow through?

37:03.830 --> 37:05.745
Look, you can have
the money back if you want.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.747
I just need a day.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.183
If I wanted the money,

37:09.227 --> 37:11.925
I wouldn't have given it
to you, Doug.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.579
What do you want?

37:13.622 --> 37:15.407
Everything.

37:15.450 --> 37:17.278
All of it.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.759
Fame. Fortune.

37:19.802 --> 37:22.327
The Carrington dynasty
is changing.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.067
Evolving.

37:24.111 --> 37:27.027
Once it does, I'll be on top.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.596
And you're going to help me
get there.

37:30.639 --> 37:32.598
No offense, but you're
kind of freaking me out.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.382
You want another
interview? Fine.

37:34.426 --> 37:35.644
Change of plans.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.298
You're an investigative
reporter.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.605
Investigate
Cristal Flores's family.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.389
They're in dirty dealings.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.652
Anything you can find
that I can use against her.

37:44.871 --> 37:47.047
What about Blake?
Isn't he your brother?

37:48.091 --> 37:50.659
I'm bored with you. We're done.

38:01.148 --> 38:05.370
Joseph Anders,
reporting for duty, sir.

38:05.413 --> 38:08.590
Relax, Anders,
this isn't the army.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.592
And you can start tomorrow.

38:10.636 --> 38:11.767
Here.

38:11.811 --> 38:13.203
To new beginnings.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.293
To a fruitful partnership.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.338
Well, this isn't really
a partnership.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.950
You work for me,
just so we're clear.

38:20.994 --> 38:23.605
I really am glad
you're here, though.

38:23.649 --> 38:26.347
There's a lot of decisions

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
to be made, like...

38:29.742 --> 38:32.048
Which one do you like
better for the bar?

38:32.092 --> 38:34.312
Well, that's clearly the choice.

38:35.356 --> 38:36.749
I knew this was
a great idea.

Yeah, I'm also naked.

For the murder of
Nathan Macintosh,

40:24.422 --> 40:25.423
also known as...

40:25.466 --> 40:26.772
Mack.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.469
Yeah. No one asked him to do it.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.645
What? Murder?

40:30.689 --> 40:32.081
Mack did it on his own.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.343
He told me years later.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.217
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.306
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

40:39.349 --> 40:40.742
in a court of law.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.788
You have the right
to an attorney...

40:48.881 --> 40:50.622
I just thought
that telling the truth

40:50.665 --> 40:52.014
was the right thing to do.

40:52.058 --> 40:53.363
It feels good.

40:53.407 --> 40:55.235
Plus, you know,
it's not like I murdered anyone.

40:55.278 --> 40:58.325
And now Trixie's family
can have some closure.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.502
And I am ready

41:01.546 --> 41:02.590
to face the consequences.

41:02.634 --> 41:03.722
Liam?

41:03.765 --> 41:06.115
Liam? Liam?

41:06.159 --> 41:07.943
Liam, Liam, Liam.
Can you hear me?

41:12.557 --> 41:13.906
I'm sorry, who are you?

41:14.950 --> 41:16.474
What?

41:16.517 --> 41:17.605
Where's my girlfriend?

41:17.649 --> 41:18.911
Ashley.

41:18.954 --> 41:20.956
Oh, that's very funny.ASHLEY:
Oh, my gosh.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.436
You woke up.Oh, Ashley,

41:22.480 --> 41:23.742
what-what am I doing here?

41:24.830 --> 41:25.831
What happened to me?

41:26.875 --> 41:28.616
Um, didn't she tell you?

41:28.660 --> 41:30.139
She won't tell me who she is.

41:30.183 --> 41:32.315
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.447
No, no, no.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.580
This is not happening.
I got it.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.146
Liam. Liam.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.932
You know me. Uh, intimately.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.154
I'm sorry, I don't.

41:46.199 --> 41:47.548
I'm really glad
you're here.

41:47.592 --> 41:50.333
ASHLEY:
Aw. Don't worry, sweetie.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.465
I'm not going anywhere.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.642
You got to be kidding me.
