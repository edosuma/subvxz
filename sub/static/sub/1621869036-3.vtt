WEBVTT

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
No!

00:39.760 --> 00:41.480
This is the building.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.000
How do we find this Professor Bill Ward?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.840
We have to assume he's some kind
of scientist. We'll start there.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.920
-Where did you find this?
-In the foyer.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.720
Thank you.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.200
She hasn't really said anything
about the Colonel.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.680
Yeah.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.240
This is how she deals with things.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.320
She works.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.880
It was the same when our parents died.
She buried her head in books.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.920
And you?

05:02.240 --> 05:03.880
What did you do?

05:06.680 --> 05:09.440
I broke things and I punched people.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.480
When I was older,

05:13.560 --> 05:20.480
I had a lot of sex
and did a lot of drugs.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.200
What will you do now you have lost Theo?

05:33.720 --> 05:36.600
I won't become that person again.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.480
Perhaps you should take a break?

12:52.200 --> 12:53.320
I'm fine.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.960
You are so not fine.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.600
-Stop.
-Why?

13:29.960 --> 13:31.920
It's okay to be upset, to cry...

13:32.560 --> 13:36.520
Why is everyone so obsessed with crying?

13:38.800 --> 13:41.040
Like if you sit around
crying all the time

13:41.120 --> 13:42.600
it makes you a better person.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.000
It achieves nothing.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.400
You cry if you want to.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.440
Okay.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.080
-I found him.
-Jesus.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.240
He's a professor of Neurogenetics at
the University of London.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.200
Don't do that to me.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.000
We head towards Lyon...

15:08.440 --> 15:10.760
... then Dijon, north to Troyes ...

15:11.360 --> 15:13.000
... Reims, Arras...

15:13.560 --> 15:14.880
... then to Calais.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.800
When we're through the Channel Tunnel,

15:16.880 --> 15:18.360
it's about a hundred kilometres
to London.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.920
You can't be sure he's even alive?

15:22.760 --> 15:25.120
The guy at the observatory,
he told me he was alive.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.440
He said he had to be.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.680
You want to risk our lives on the
word of a half dead alien?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.120
Why would he lie?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.240
Maybe he wasn't lying.
Maybe he's just wrong.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.640
Maybe he was out of his mind.
You don't know.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.080
I believed him.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.400
It's hundreds of kilometres.
It's too dangerous.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.720
You think it's safe here?

15:42.160 --> 15:44.440
They came to the observatory
and killed everyone.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.640
They killed them...

15:53.120 --> 15:55.560
He said that we could change everything.
That it wasn't too late...

15:55.640 --> 15:57.200
What does that even mean?

15:57.280 --> 15:58.560
I don't know.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.240
I think the answers are in here.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.320
This is crazy.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.080
What do you want to do? You're so smart.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.360
Maybe you want to wander
around with your rifle shooting them...

16:06.440 --> 16:09.600
... until you have no bullets left
and then they kill us.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
That's a great plan, genius.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.600
I want to keep you and Sophia safe.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.680
Maybe the best way to do that
is to go to London,

16:16.360 --> 16:19.240
...and find this guy and
actually try and do something!

16:19.320 --> 16:20.800
You're too stupid to see that!

16:28.880 --> 16:30.880
She needs this.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.480
You want to risk your life
because she needs it?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.120
Maybe.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.440
Yes. It's better than
risking your life for nothing.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.680
Okay. We'll go to London...

18:54.400 --> 18:56.160
... and try and find this professor guy.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.600
Really?

19:01.160 --> 19:02.280
Yes.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.880
Thank you.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.680
You're not the only one
who's lost someone.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.240
You don't have to be a bitch about it.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.280
Give me the backpack!

21:09.960 --> 21:11.200
I'm sorry.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.000
It's a car.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.680
Stay here.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.760
Shit.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.760
Open the door!

22:47.680 --> 22:48.920
Come on!

23:14.080 --> 23:15.280
Is he dead?

29:28.560 --> 29:29.920
Are you okay?

29:33.040 --> 29:34.960
What's wrong?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.040
They killed...

29:43.520 --> 29:45.800
...the only man I've ever loved.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.920
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel...

29:53.200 --> 29:55.160
I don't know what to do...

30:04.160 --> 30:10.720
You feel like you want the world to end.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.000
What can I do?

30:16.520 --> 30:17.840
Nothing.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.000
All you can do is cry.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.280
Thank you.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.680
We found you in your car.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.960
You should have left me.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.760
You've lost people?

34:58.760 --> 35:00.520
My whole family...

35:05.200 --> 35:08.120
My daughters were in Lille
during the attack.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.400
They never made it home.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.320
My wife was killed
about three months ago.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.960
Those things.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.680
My son died last week.

35:27.120 --> 35:30.400
The ones that look like us...

35:31.120 --> 35:33.960
We thought they were human.
We didn't know.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.360
They shot him.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.160
I'm sorry.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.480
There didn't seem any point carrying on.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.080
It's okay. They're with me.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.640
This is my sister, Sophia.
And this is Nathan. Victor.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.400
-Hi.
-Hello.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.040
Hello.

36:25.880 --> 36:26.960
You want some wine?

36:29.080 --> 36:30.160
Yes, thank you.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.280
You okay?

36:47.600 --> 36:48.960
You've been crying?

36:57.760 --> 36:59.080
So have you asked him yet?

36:59.960 --> 37:01.400
What?

37:02.640 --> 37:04.720
Whether we can take his car?

37:08.520 --> 37:10.040
How did you get it working?

37:11.480 --> 37:16.800
Old cars have less electrical circuits.
They can be repaired.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.440
We need to get to London.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.960
What's in London?

37:31.840 --> 37:32.840
Him.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.600
You can take my car.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.160
You should come with us.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.680
I think I'll stay.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.360
So you can blow your brains out
with a shotgun?

43:19.160 --> 43:20.800
Are you religious?

43:23.800 --> 43:24.960
No.

43:25.480 --> 43:26.640
I had faith.

43:31.520 --> 43:35.080
I believed there was a God.

43:36.080 --> 43:40.520
Even as my family died, I prayed.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.880
I prayed...

43:46.200 --> 43:48.720
... until there was no-one left
to pray for.

43:52.240 --> 43:55.000
What kind of God would let this happen?

43:56.720 --> 43:59.320
You're asking the wrong person.

44:00.360 --> 44:02.040
I'm a scientist.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.520
But now you're risking your life
to go to London...

44:05.600 --> 44:08.920
for reasons you don't
fully understand...

44:09.640 --> 44:13.280
because a man told you
he believed something?

44:13.920 --> 44:16.200
That's an act of faith.

44:18.520 --> 44:21.240
Maybe we all need a little faith now.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.560
Come with us.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.400
Maybe this is all part of God's plan.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.560
You don't believe that.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.880
You just don't want me to kill myself.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.080
True.

44:37.920 --> 44:39.720
I think that's a pretty good reason.

44:42.040 --> 44:43.360
Come with us.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.800
Please.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.760
I'm so sorry about Theo.

45:30.240 --> 45:34.200
How you were with him.
It made me so proud.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.320
What's he doing in there?

45:46.560 --> 45:48.480
Maybe he told us to wait outside

45:48.560 --> 45:50.760
so that he could finish what he started.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.120
Thank you.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.360
You like music?

46:58.280 --> 47:00.520
She hates music.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.400
I don't hate music.

47:02.680 --> 47:03.880
You never listened to it.

47:03.960 --> 47:07.400
That doesn't mean I hate it.

47:08.080 --> 47:10.160
Then this is for you.
