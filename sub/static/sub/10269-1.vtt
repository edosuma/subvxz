01:58.000 --> 02:01.527
Stop!

02:10.479 --> 02:14.201
Mister, you got some money for us?

02:14.560 --> 02:16.085
Come on.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.051
Quick.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.130
Quick!

05:27.760 --> 05:32.322
WUJINSHAN (Black Gold Mountain)

05:56.200 --> 05:58.202
Which way to Wujinshan?

05:58.280 --> 05:59.361
You're here.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.683
- Highway 307?
- This is it.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.161
Dahai.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.169
Whose trike is that outside?

07:56.240 --> 07:57.969
I don't know.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.445
No?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.489
Sit down, Dahai.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.281
It's been there two days.
No idea whose it is.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.250
If no one wants it, I'll sell it.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.687
So if the village chief's Audi
A6 sat outside his house,

08:16.760 --> 08:18.888
you'd sell that too?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.041
What do you think?

08:20.120 --> 08:23.408
His A6 belongs to
everyone in the village.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.241
He sold the state-owned coal
mine so he could afford it.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.840
No wonder the car
looks so familiar.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.764
Those shiny wheels
are actually mine.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.081
You're smart.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.645
Dahai.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.847
A pity you weren't born earlier.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.967
In the war years,

08:41.080 --> 08:44.208
you'd surely have made general.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.725
Just see what happens.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.167
When I report to Beijing,

08:48.240 --> 08:52.245
the chief and the new boss Jiao
will be hauling sand in prison.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.609
Before you even get to Taiyuan,
the chief's men will catch you.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.724
Why do you think I studied law?

08:59.800 --> 09:03.088
The chief sold off
collectively owned property.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.208
He accepted a bribe.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.248
That'll get him 20 years.

09:07.320 --> 09:11.041
As for your boss Jiao Shengli,
he's rolling in it, right?

09:11.120 --> 09:14.681
I'll accuse him of polluting and
covering up accidents in the mine.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.364
They'll close him down.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.841
Believe it.

09:19.840 --> 09:25.688
If the coal mine had gone to you,
you'd have been no different.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.649
I would have.

09:27.720 --> 09:32.328
Jiao's Maserati is parked in
the yard. Nobody uses it.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.768
Drive it off and sell it. Then
you can buy us all a drink.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.161
I don't want his fucking car.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.761
- Sanming. Got the train ticket?
- Yes.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.003
- Where are you going?
- To see my wife for New Year's.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.162
That's romantic.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.242
The police are here.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.169
Stop eating.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.603
Investigation.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.286
Are all the migrant workers here?

10:02.360 --> 10:03.691
Yes. What's wrong?

10:03.760 --> 10:07.128
A murder in Shibawan. The
migrants have to be checked.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.283
Get them all outside.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.089
Hurry!

10:19.120 --> 10:20.406
Chief.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.641
Village Chief.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.770
When you sold off the coal mine
you promised yearly dividends.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.808
I said that in private.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.723
I don't have time now.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.168
Okay, explain it to the
Discipline Commission.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.725
You've picked the wrong
time for a fight.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.450
You'll be a loser your whole life.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.607
- You won't discuss it?
- You talk too much.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.127
Okay. People from Chongqing.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.766
Over there.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.126
Next.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.369
He's making a run for it!

12:19.360 --> 12:20.885
Damn animal!

13:08.120 --> 13:09.167
What's up, Dahai?

13:09.240 --> 13:12.084
I'm writing to the
Discipline Commission

13:12.160 --> 13:15.289
to complain about the
chief and Jiao Shengli.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.726
Miss, a registered letter.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.691
- To whom?
- Beijing. Zhongnanhai. The Commission.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.491
I need the full address.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.403
Zhongnanhai, Beijing.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.689
That's not enough.
I need the full address.

13:30.760 --> 13:34.082
What? Everyone knows Zhongnanhai.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.162
That's not enough.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.130
Miss, are you siding
with the village chief?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.521
Does he give you kickbacks?

13:41.600 --> 13:45.605
Or are you Jiao's mistress?
Has he bought you a car?

13:45.680 --> 13:47.762
You're crazy! Go away!

13:48.520 --> 13:51.000
You two must be in league.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.969
There's no justice!

13:53.040 --> 13:54.280
No justice!

13:54.960 --> 13:56.689
No justice.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.205
All aboard! We're leaving, hurry!

14:11.280 --> 14:14.124
Dahai, come on!

14:15.560 --> 14:16.641
What's this for?

14:16.720 --> 14:20.805
Greeting Boss Jiao. One
bag of flour per person.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.485
Boss Jiao has a new private plane.
He's flying back from Hong Kong.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.928
We're a welcoming group.
Everyone gets a bag of flour.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.368
A plane? Living on this
earth isn't enough?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.725
Were you at the coal mine
when the gun was fired?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.370
Yes.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.322
Who was the guy who ran away?

14:49.400 --> 14:52.927
A loader in the coal yard.
From Sichuan.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.686
Why did he run?
The killings in Shibawan?

14:56.760 --> 14:58.922
He's an escaped prisoner.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.169
Killed someone in his hometown.
He's been hiding here.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.083
He thought they'd come for him.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.561
He panicked and ran.

15:06.640 --> 15:10.122
- Did they catch him?
- Of course.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.210
- What happened in Shibawan?
- Don't you know?

15:16.280 --> 15:20.968
Someone shot three guys yesterday.
Three dead in Shibawan.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.611
- Who did it?
- I don't know.

15:23.680 --> 15:28.527
Early this morning, a bunch of
armed police were in Shibawan.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.522
I see.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.367
Accountant Liu, are your
accounts up to date?

15:40.120 --> 15:44.170
When Boss Jiao got
hold of the coal mine

15:44.240 --> 15:47.722
he said 40% of the profits
would go to the village.

15:47.840 --> 15:52.402
How much do the last 14
years' dividends come to?

15:52.480 --> 15:55.529
Listen, back in 2001,

15:55.640 --> 15:59.167
the village committee signed
to sell the coal mine.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.242
Who asked you to sell it?

16:01.320 --> 16:03.607
Was the contract discussed?

16:03.680 --> 16:05.921
We must keep our word.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.961
But Jiao got so rich he
even bought a plane.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.088
He's a hard worker.

16:13.200 --> 16:19.321
Then tell me how much you and
the chief took in bribes.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.562
Stop, please.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.164
Tell me how much you
took in bribes.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.765
Open the door.

16:27.880 --> 16:32.522
Devils like you are more evil
than the village chief and Jiao.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.606
- Listen to me...
- Don't talk to me.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.170
Everyone, repeat after me.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.681
Welcome! Welcome!

16:55.760 --> 16:57.330
A warm welcome!

17:00.640 --> 17:02.085
Good.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.208
Here's the plane!

18:02.680 --> 18:05.763
Mr. Jiao, you've
reached a new level.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.525
Let's progress together.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.841
Congratulations, ma'am.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.684
Kids, the flowers.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.087
Mr. Jiao, look this way.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.126
A bit closer, please.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.362
- Please say something, sir.
- Later.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.042
How are you, Auntie?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.809
Thanks for coming.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.803
Long time no see.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.486
- Shengli!
- Dahai.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.642
Congratulations.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.643
Thank you, Dahai.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.848
You're a hard man to reach.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.968
There's something
I want to discuss.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.048
Can you do me a favor?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.043
Whatever you need, just ask.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.963
Sponsor my journey to Beijing

19:12.040 --> 19:15.442
to file accusations against
you and the village chief.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.770
Sure, come and pick it up later.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.207
Here, in front of all
these villagers,

19:21.280 --> 19:24.443
can't you discuss the
village economy?

19:28.120 --> 19:30.407
What are you staring at?

20:09.440 --> 20:12.683
Xiao Bai, are you playing golf?

20:44.680 --> 20:48.480
I'm here to compensate you on
behalf of the Shengli Group.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.523
Case closed.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.209
Where's your mother?

22:53.280 --> 22:56.887
- Who are you?
- Don't you remember me?

22:56.960 --> 23:00.726
I'm your uncle from Wujinshan.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.202
Mom went out for food.
She'll be back soon.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.325
Animal.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.368
Where's your dad?

23:17.440 --> 23:20.683
Out hunting "animals."

23:20.760 --> 23:22.842
On which mountain?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.644
Jiaokou.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.609
Dahai.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.651
You've...

23:32.160 --> 23:34.322
When did you get here?

23:34.400 --> 23:37.085
I've been in town a couple of days.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.688
Let's go inside.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.885
Ganggang. Eat first, then homework.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.962
Of course, Mom.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.809
You're...

23:49.720 --> 23:51.370
Tell me.

23:55.440 --> 23:59.161
A while back, I introduced
you to a woman from Wangcun.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.288
You were well matched.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.566
But you...

24:02.640 --> 24:05.723
Why didn't you date
her, as arranged?

24:05.800 --> 24:09.930
You never think about your life.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.087
All you do is make accusations.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.846
Even if your charges
stick, you'll grow old.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.766
I'm already old. But I don't care.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.649
Don't be silly.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.405
You're only middle-aged.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.927
The kid's here.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.287
I'm at fault here.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.488
You really are hopeless.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.530
I told you when we
were still at school.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.331
There's more to life
than getting rich.

24:47.400 --> 24:51.007
You want to be more
evil than Jiao Shengli?

24:51.080 --> 24:53.321
How can you compare me with him?

24:53.400 --> 24:55.562
If not him, then who?

24:55.680 --> 24:57.842
You and he were classmates.

24:57.920 --> 25:02.403
Look what he's made of
himself compared to us here.

25:03.080 --> 25:07.722
You have your own
place in Wujinshan.

25:07.800 --> 25:13.682
But my husband and I don't
even have a home of our own.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.005
Enough of this.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.448
If you have time on your hands,
why not open a restaurant?

25:20.520 --> 25:23.729
Or a shop? To earn
money and get married.

25:23.800 --> 25:28.124
Your life belongs to you.
Stop caring what others do.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.850
My dear, wait and see.

25:34.920 --> 25:39.482
I can be more evil than the
village chief or Jiao.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.003
Isn't that Mr. Golf?

26:14.480 --> 26:16.721
- What did you call me?
- Mr. Golf.

26:16.800 --> 26:20.247
Everyone calls you Mr. Golf now.
Didn't you know?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.364
Mr. Golf!

26:56.120 --> 26:57.645
I...

27:00.120 --> 27:01.451
Lin Chong...

27:05.000 --> 27:08.527
unsheathed my sword and, in anger,

27:08.600 --> 27:11.444
slew two of Gao Qiu's henchmen.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.000
Fortunately for me,

27:14.080 --> 27:16.651
Officer Chai gave me a document

27:16.720 --> 27:20.805
which enabled me to
come to Mount Liang.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.764
Good morning.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.686
Dahai, good morning.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.808
I want a word with your husband.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.723
Go ahead.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.010
Write.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.369
Write what?

29:58.040 --> 30:01.249
You know how much the
village chief embezzled.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.728
- Write a confession.
- You're being ridiculous.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.926
What are you doing?
That's dangerous.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.809
Write it down.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.404
Write!

30:34.040 --> 30:35.405
Write.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.805
Shoot.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.690
Shoot me here.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.244
You're too much of a
coward to kill me.

32:53.080 --> 32:56.209
Village Chief. It's Liuliu.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.248
I just started work.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.882
What do you want done?

33:04.080 --> 33:07.368
Okay, don't worry.
I'll do it this afternoon.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.244
Mr. Golf.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.482
- Where's the chief?
- At the temple.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.569
What did you just call me?

33:19.040 --> 33:20.326
Mr. Golf.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.085
Isn't that your foreign name?

33:23.160 --> 33:24.844
Little bastard.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.604
What did you say?

33:54.440 --> 33:56.329
- Dahai.
- Where are you off to?

33:56.400 --> 34:00.086
Fengjie. Going hunting?

34:00.160 --> 34:01.924
Hunting animals.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.962
Stop fooling around.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.322
Calm down.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.688
Let's sit down and talk.

34:41.159 --> 34:42.969
We can sort it out.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.762
Listen, don't be impulsive.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.530
Let's sit down.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.050
Bastard!

37:29.520 --> 37:31.284
Dahai?

37:44.960 --> 37:46.962
How can we fix this?

37:47.040 --> 37:48.246
Just tell me.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.805
Hey.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.767
You got a light?

39:54.840 --> 39:56.330
No.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.162
Motorcycle taxi.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.446
- Where to, buddy?
- The expressway.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.443
Let's go.

40:57.680 --> 41:02.402
Our Mrs. Zhou here worked
hard to raise her children.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.727
Now it's her 70th birthday,

41:04.800 --> 41:08.930
so let's wish her happiness,
good health and a long life.

41:11.200 --> 41:15.091
And now, let's welcome her
second son and his family,

41:15.200 --> 41:17.248
with their birthday greetings.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.322
San'er is here!

41:21.120 --> 41:23.361
The youngest son is back.

41:32.760 --> 41:33.841
You're back.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.922
Brother.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.526
Why are you running off?

41:56.600 --> 41:58.170
Come here.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.400
Mother.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.490
Don't cry.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.048
Where did you come from?

43:15.080 --> 43:17.367
I came by boat.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.489
And before that?

43:25.640 --> 43:27.449
I got your money transfers.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.568
130,000 yuan in all.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.009
That's right.

43:37.360 --> 43:41.251
The most recent one
came from Shanxi.

44:02.720 --> 44:06.520
I earned it in Wuhan and
sent it from Shanxi.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.849
I don't want your money.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.888
Your brothers are coming.

45:12.240 --> 45:16.245
Mother's birthday was on the 7th
day of the 11th lunar month.

45:16.320 --> 45:20.450
But we two had to work that day.
We couldn't get home.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.729
Our relatives couldn't
get here either.

45:24.480 --> 45:26.926
Since New Year is now and
many people come home,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.571
we decided to celebrate today.

45:32.520 --> 45:37.162
I'll go through it for you both.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.365
For Mother's 70th
birthday celebrations

45:40.440 --> 45:46.322
we received gifts of money
totaling 10,270 yuan.

45:47.840 --> 45:49.968
12 tables of guests.

45:50.040 --> 45:54.090
To buy meat, vegetables,
wine and cigarettes,

45:54.160 --> 45:59.007
the total cost was 6,477
yuan and 33 cents.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.083
I hired a host for 800 yuan.

46:03.160 --> 46:05.891
Taking all expenses into account,

46:05.960 --> 46:11.285
I had to spend 7,485
yuan and 42 cents.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.567
That was the total cost.

46:15.600 --> 46:20.003
What's left is 2,784
yuan and 58 cents.

46:21.200 --> 46:24.090
This money, the way I see it,

46:24.160 --> 46:27.289
should be shared between
us three and Mother.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.885
A quarter each.

46:28.960 --> 46:32.965
I've already divided it
into four equal shares.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.371
- Right, Second Brother?
- Yes.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.963
I don't need a share.
Give mine to Mother.

46:47.240 --> 46:51.882
I bought ten packs of cigarettes.
A good brand.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.768
There are nine left.

46:55.840 --> 46:59.242
So, that makes three each.

47:01.960 --> 47:06.841
As the oldest brother
I have to be impartial.

47:08.800 --> 47:11.963
If you want your share
to go to Mother,

47:12.480 --> 47:14.687
give it to her yourself.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.249
People usually worship
the gods tomorrow.

47:53.760 --> 47:56.127
I'm worshiping ghosts.

48:28.400 --> 48:31.643
The gods were to blame.

48:32.480 --> 48:35.802
If you have any grievances,
tell heaven about them.

49:37.600 --> 49:40.888
Is Qinqin in Dongguan?
Didn't she come back with you?

49:40.960 --> 49:43.440
She's gone to Zhongshan.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.961
She won't be back.

49:46.720 --> 49:49.121
She tested HIV positive.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.609
AIDS?

49:52.120 --> 49:54.646
Didn't she work in a factory?

49:55.320 --> 49:59.006
Impossible to make a decent living.

49:59.320 --> 50:03.644
Lili has a hair salon in Zhongshan,
so Qinqin went to work there.

50:04.600 --> 50:09.083
She provided "special services."
That's how she got AIDS.

50:09.600 --> 50:10.726
Bloody...

50:11.560 --> 50:13.324
you slept with her once.

50:13.400 --> 50:15.926
You'd better have a check-up.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.448
Don't talk crap.

50:18.520 --> 50:21.842
Get a check-up, quick.
Good luck with it.

50:21.920 --> 50:26.847
What's your wife up to in Tianjin
while you're stuck here?

50:26.960 --> 50:29.566
You should get her checked up.

50:29.640 --> 50:31.881
- Maybe you have HIV.
- What?

50:31.960 --> 50:34.088
You should keep your mouth shut.

50:34.160 --> 50:36.208
You want to die?

50:36.520 --> 50:39.171
Scumbag! Let's settle
this right now!

50:39.600 --> 50:42.331
Action? Let's see it, then.

50:42.400 --> 50:46.007
Only 78 minutes to go
till the New Year bell.

50:46.520 --> 50:49.490
Think you can take me?

52:24.200 --> 52:27.124
- Shall we set off a firework?
- Great!

52:32.960 --> 52:34.610
Watch.

53:06.160 --> 53:08.845
Tickets to Guangzhou, 240 yuan.

53:08.920 --> 53:12.003
Wuhan. Anybody for Wuhan?

53:16.680 --> 53:18.364
Want a ticket?

53:18.440 --> 53:21.444
- To Nanning?
- Yes, how many?

53:21.520 --> 53:23.761
Where else?

53:23.840 --> 53:25.444
Yichang.

53:27.880 --> 53:31.362
One each for Guangzhou,
Yichang and Nanning.

53:31.440 --> 53:34.250
Wait for me on the bridge.
I'll bring them.

53:34.320 --> 53:37.130
- Be quick.
- Okay, wait for me.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.930
Ladies and gentlemen...

53:44.320 --> 53:47.244
Chongqing Railway
Station reminds you

53:47.320 --> 53:50.164
that during this holiday congestion

53:50.240 --> 53:52.607
it is strictly prohibited to
carry combustible materials

53:52.680 --> 53:56.526
as well as firearms and knives.

54:02.040 --> 54:04.407
Will you go to Guangzhou,

54:04.480 --> 54:06.482
Yichang.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.764
Or Nanning?

54:29.840 --> 54:32.207
You've looked in my bag?

54:37.520 --> 54:42.208
Not sure yet. I'd
like to go to Burma.

54:47.240 --> 54:51.211
You can't stay here in the village?

55:02.160 --> 55:04.401
It's boring.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.566
What isn't boring?

55:12.880 --> 55:16.043
Shooting guns isn't boring.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.482
What would you do in Burma?

55:34.760 --> 55:38.003
I'd buy a new fast-loading pistol.

55:42.040 --> 55:46.045
You should buy a cell phone.
Then I could call you.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.404
No way.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.482
Too dangerous.

57:02.800 --> 57:05.121
Can I help you?

57:06.640 --> 57:08.688
Just looking.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.283
Feel free.

57:21.080 --> 57:24.289
- Where's the bathroom?
- Over there.

57:24.360 --> 57:27.204
Can you watch my bag?
I'll be right back.

57:27.280 --> 57:29.408
All right.

59:18.360 --> 59:22.410
- Go ahead and start the car.
- Be careful.

59:37.360 --> 59:39.249
Xiaoyan.

59:39.320 --> 59:42.483
- Where are you going?
- To get her immunized.

59:42.560 --> 59:45.040
Time for her shot?

59:45.120 --> 59:46.451
Afraid?

59:46.560 --> 59:47.891
Say no.

59:47.960 --> 59:50.361
- How are things?
- As usual.

59:50.480 --> 59:51.720
Let's have tea sometime.

59:51.800 --> 59:53.564
I'll call you.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.805
Driver, stop here.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.885
Stop.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.008
I can't, till the next rest area.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.923
Stop here.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.848
Traffic jam?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.400
Small delay in Tianmen.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.926
When did you get here?

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.124
Just now.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.202
You're frowning.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.125
To get to the station?

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.801
I booked a black car.
The driver's waiting.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.647
Driver Wang? It's me.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.449
Car booked for Xiaoyu.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.648
You can come now.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.290
Okay.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.008
Did you tell her?

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.089
I started to.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.449
What did you say?

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.050
I hinted.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.007
You're delaying again.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.647
She must have understood.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.521
Come to Guangzhou with me.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.600
I've been with you so many years.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.808
Why do I wait?

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.081
I accept things the way they are.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.367
But I owe my parents
an explanation.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.648
I want a baby.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.728
Let's go to Guangzhou together.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.803
Either you stay with your
wife and we separate,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.090
or you divorce her and
we live together.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.809
You have to choose.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.402
Let's go together.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.130
Once you get back to Guangzhou,
I'll give you six months.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:55.370
We can both think it over,
then make the decision.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.410
Sir, there's a problem
with your bag.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.482
Please come to have it checked.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.528
Open the bag.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.409
You can't take this on the train.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.888
- It's a fruit knife.
- It's not permitted.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.442
- Why not?
- Regulations.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.921
What if I eat an apple?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.082
Eat it with the peel.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.850
Give it to me, I'll take it.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.443
Then you can't go.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.446
I'm not going.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.648
Or enter the station.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.368
Forget the knife.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.167
Your ID card?

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.163
I'll leave first.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.130
Call me when you get there.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.601
This is your final
call for train 934

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.050
from Yichang East
to Guangzhou East.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.729
Fellow countrymen in
Yuanshan village,

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.963
come and have a look!

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.691
Roll up, roll up!

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.606
See the holy snakes.
See the beauty.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.729
A marriage is to be.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.963
The holy snakes
foretell weal and woe.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.771
Roll up, roll up!

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.731
See the holy snakes.
See the beauty.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.321
NIGHT-COMER SAUNA

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.043
Good evening, sir.
Overnight or sauna?

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.806
- Are you Xiaoyu?
- Yes.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.803
I'm Zhang Youliang's wife.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.450
Bitch!

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.242
Shameless whore!
I'll beat you to death!

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.450
Did your mother give birth to
you just to seduce my husband?

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.331
Number 11, your turn.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.130
Thank you.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.562
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.247
You have been there a long time.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.487
You know the ropes.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.448
If you don't know the ropes here...

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.442
you won't earn much.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.849
I'd rather stay here.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.644
When will this airport be finished?

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.488
They're working on
the runway first.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:11.804
When that's finished, most
of the workers will leave.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.882
I'll leave too.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.325
Mom...

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.005
I saw Dad in Yichang.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.042
I don't want to hear about him.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.125
Incredible! How could this happen?

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.406
At 8:38 p.m. yesterday,

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:07.441
the Beijing to Fuzhou train
reached Shangyu, in Wenzhou.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:12.162
There it ran into a stationary train
going from Hangzhou to Fuzhou.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:18.088
The collision caused the first four
carriages to plunge from the viaduct.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.731
Two carriages from the
other train also fell.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.202
The current death toll stands at 35

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:28.046
Nineteen have been identified.
They include two foreigners.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.566
In all, 270 people were injured.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.164
- Pay the toll.
- What toll?

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.605
Transit fee, 10 yuan.

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.604
- We work at the airport site.
- You're most liable.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.127
When your trucks pass through
our town, you leave potholes.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.004
From today you have to pay.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.004
- I don't drive the trucks.
- It makes no difference.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.442
You work at the airport?

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.126
I'll pay if you give me a receipt.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.603
Receipt?

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.690
Receipt.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.364
Take care of this guy.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.889
Stop it, you'll kill him!

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.321
Can an animal commit suicide?

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.688
For those who think that humans

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:31.482
are the only advanced
creatures on earth...

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.286
Xiaoyu, your shift's over.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.362
Did you know animals
commit suicide?

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.966
So they don't know the saying:

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.646
Better to live miserable
than die happy.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.927
Animals wouldn't agree.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.121
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.486
Sauna or overnight?

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.805
Sauna, then give us a room.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.890
Sauna. Two guests for sauna.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.331
Washing clothes?

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.401
Yes.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.641
What's your employee number?

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.564
I don't have one.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.403
Give me a massage.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.282
Please go to the third floor.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.489
- The masseuses are there.
- I want an untrained person.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.166
Give me a full set. I'll tip you.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.691
Sorry, sir, I'm a receptionist,
not a masseuse.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.445
Receptionist? Then
why are you up here?

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.524
Sorry.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.124
What do you mean by that?

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.202
Nothing.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.530
Don't look down on me.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.723
- You'll be well paid.
- Get out.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.644
Fuck. Stop pretending.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.965
- I'll have you.
- I'm not a masseuse!

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.089
Then why are you in a sauna?

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.764
- Get out.
- Fuck.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.320
You've had too many
pretty boys, eh?

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.890
We can afford you.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.964
I'm not a prostitute.
Go home to your wives.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.843
- Now what?
- I'm having you!

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.286
- No, you're not!
- I'm not?

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.287
- I have money.
- Money can't buy everything!

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.682
I have money. Isn't
it good enough?

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.681
It's not fucking good enough?

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.360
I'll smother you in it!

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.726
Not a prostitute?

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.280
I'll smother you in money!

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.246
Bitch!

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.800
I have fucking money!

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.885
Fuck!

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:06.960
Fuck you!

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.566
Isn't my money good enough?

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.847
It's not good enough?

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.846
Not a prostitute? Who is, then?

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.731
Hello, this is the 110
emergency call line.

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.761
I've killed someone.

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.162
Hands off my phone.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.610
Where's the GPS?

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.444
You want GPS, buy a fucking BMW.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:16.525
I'm going to see my buddy in
Dongguan. I don't know the way.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.811
Get a motorcycle taxi
and then a train.

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.882
A high-speed train?

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.201
- Which town in Dongguan is it?
- Humen.

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.727
What should I do?

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.080
The company rules say:
"No small talk during working hours."

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.801
The accident today was your fault.

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.285
Agreed?

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:11.087
The company will pay
the medical fees.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.447
You'll pay for the man-hours.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.447
It'll take two weeks
for his hand to heal.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.686
For that period your
wages will go to him.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.121
You'll work for him.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:34.762
Ladies and gentlemen, the
next stop will be Dongguan.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.248
Hey, buddy.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.841
He gets my wages while he's off.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:35.367
So if he's off for 100 days he
gets 100 days' wages from me.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.411
Shit. That means you work for him.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.807
So I ran away.

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:45.680
Luckily I got paid not
long ago so I'm ahead.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.601
Come and work here.
The factory's recruiting.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:52.684
Basic pay is 1,200 yuan,
plus meals and a bed.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.402
What do most people get?

01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.482
About 2,500 yuan.

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:01.083
Training?

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:04.250
One week, without pay.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.886
Anything else going?

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:14.563
You could be a waiter in Changping.

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.291
A waiter?

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.409
In a nightclub. The johns are
from Hong Kong and Taiwan.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.603
They tip well. But you
gotta work nights.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:28.608
- Is it far?
- Nah. It's another town in Dongguan.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.688
Hello, Mr. Lau.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.601
This guy's from my village.
Please take care of him.

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.524
- Your buddy?
- Sure, his name's Xiaohui.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.967
Xiaohui, get in.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.362
Call me if anything comes up.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.488
Nothing will.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.410
- Look after him.
- Sure.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:12.844
When a guest arrives,
don't call him "sir."

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:17.562
From now on he's a
"distinguished guest."

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:22.089
So you say, "Good evening,
distinguished guest. Welcome."

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.889
Now, after me.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.241
Good evening, distinguished guest.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.645
Good evening, distinguished guest.
Welcome to The Golden Age.

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.081
In Cantonese.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.163
In English.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.161
Show the guest to room 214.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.971
- What are you doing?
- I didn't see anything.

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.849
What didn't you see?

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.406
I didn't see anything.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:15.523
It's okay, I'm decent.

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.804
New here?

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.566
- Name?
- Xiaohui.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.924
- From Hunan?
- How'd you know that?

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.243
Easy. I recognize your accent.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.601
I'm from Hunan too.

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.884
Come here.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.882
I'm Lianrong.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.726
It means "lotus seed."

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.488
Easy to remember.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.324
Delicious.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.410
We were meant to meet here.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:04.802
Lots of people are
"meant to meet here."

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.288
Give me a hand.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.691
Sir.

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.847
I'm in Dongguan.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.281
A painting by Xu Beihong?

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.044
Buy it.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.521
Great investment.

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.727
Okay, see you in Macao.

01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:59.808
We're done.

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.889
- Slacking?
- No.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.888
Aren't you slacking?

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.566
This room has great Wi-Fi.

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.447
Are there many guests?

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.727
On and off.

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.850
We have a rush around
1:00, another at 3:00

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.491
and another at 5:00.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.970
It's snowing in Shanxi
and Inner Mongolia.

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:12.249
It can't be. Here in
Dongguan it's still 75 °F.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.090
Fuck.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.364
At the home of a land-bureau chief

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:25.762
they found more than
130 Louis Vuitton bags.

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.081
Why did he buy so many?

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.770
- He's a she.
- A lady needs that many?

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:34.207
As I said, she's a lady.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:41.288
Let's post a comment.

01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:47.404
- What to write?
- WTF.

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.688
WTF.

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:55.889
The bags were worth
over 2 million yuan.

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.242
Anything else?

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.489
A mine explosion in Shanxi.

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.087
- Dozens dead.
- Post a comment.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.687
- What?
- WTF.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.326
WTF.

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.764
What's your handle?

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:26.322
On QQ, I'm Little Bird.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:31.803
- Is it really little?
- That's going too far.

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.009
Just lending a hand.

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.691
You're embarrassed.

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.208
What's your handle?

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.404
I forgot!

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.925
They're not dead?

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.050
- You have fish?
- I'm going to set them free tomorrow.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.483
Are you a Buddhist?

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.164
Yes.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:22.766
In this line of work, the Cantonese
call us "illicit traders."

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:27.084
So we need to do lots of good deeds
to be forgiven in our next life.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.403
Do you understand Little Bird?

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:36.242
My handle is Fish Seeks Water.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:09.883
Welcome. Room 7 is here.

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.487
Now for the first lesson in
our Quick Cantonese series.

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:32.930
When you meet the right guy you'll
know what to say in Cantonese.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.083
When two people are first
drawn to each other,

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:39.846
if the boy's bold enough,
he'll say, "I like you."

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.810
There are more girls
than boys in Dongguan,

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.124
so it's quite common for a
girl to approach a boy.

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:37.446
I only know one
sentence in Cantonese.

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:41.369
Say it.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.568
I like you very much.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.362
Let's leave Dongguan.

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:21.367
Where will you take me?

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.801
As long as you're coming,
anywhere will do.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.646
There's no true love in sex work.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.087
How well do you know me?

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.521
I have a daughter.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.926
That day you saw me on the train,

01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.520
I was going to see
her in Guangzhou.

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.562
She's three.

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.082
I have to raise her.

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:31.929
Leaders' Train Room.

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.090
Come in.

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:43.640
I want a conductor, not a nurse.

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.042
Won't a nurse be good?
There's your health to consider.

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.690
That's enough.

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.764
Go look after sick comrades.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:55.208
- But...
- I'm in excellent health.

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.770
Leave now.

01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.922
Please wait, then.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.970
- Your fruit, distinguished guest.
- Leave it there.

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:33.161
Distinguished guest,
may I serve you?

01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.925
Address me as Chief Leader.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.241
Chief Leader.

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:41.688
That's better. Let's set off.

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.604
Where to?

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:54.809
You don't know where we're going?

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:57.451
Wherever you want, we'll go.

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.605
Young people nowadays have
no sense of direction.

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.923
Any recent innovations?

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.364
Come here.

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:43.242
Have fun, buddy.

01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:52.723
I have no place to go.
I came here to join you.

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.889
Consider it carefully.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:01.000
Stick with it, no walking out,
or I'd lose face.

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.770
I know.

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:03.245
OASIS OF PROSPERITY

01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:56.529
- Are you new here?
- I'm a trainee.

01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:59.524
Hello. I'm your
workshop supervisor.

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:03.491
Welcome to a Fortune
500 company. Work hard.

01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:08.327
Top employees win trips to Taiwan
and visits to our headquarters.

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:09.481
Good luck.

01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:12.040
- Where are you from?
- Hunan. And you?

01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:13.770
Taiwan.

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.729
Hey, Mom.

01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:09.843
Didn't I send you
money not long ago?

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:14.321
I changed jobs.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:17.410
We get paid at the
end of the month.

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:23.683
I just checked, I'm broke.

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.362
Why would I lie? I'm at the
bank now, I just came out.

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:39.844
I don't waste money.
I can't live on nothing.

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:42.366
I'm not a bank robber.

01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.725
I really don't waste money.

01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:40.446
Thought you could skip work?
Chang Ling wants to see you.

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.766
- Hu Yunyun?
- Here.

02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.561
- Your name is Zheng Xiaoyu?
- Yes.

02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:04.122
Your ID card?

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:18.328
- You're from Hubei?
- Right.

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.846
Are you familiar with
our Shengli Group?

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.450
From the Internet, I know a bit.

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.129
This is Mrs. Jiao. She
currently chairs our company.

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:36.364
Why have you come all the
way to Shanxi for a job?

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:40.887
Do you have relatives here?

02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:42.924
No.

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.444
You're a bit older than
the other applicants.

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:52.520
What work experience do you have?

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.765
I used to work in a garment
factory in Guangzhou.

02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.763
Guangzhou?

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:03.285
Why did you leave Guangzhou?

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:06.761
I wanted a new environment.

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.367
Your name rings a bell.

02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:15.171
Is that problem behind you now?

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.122
Yes, it is.

02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:15.721
In court, the magistrate
changes his mind

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.087
He brands me, Su San,
as a murderer

02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:34.767
I cannot defend myself

02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:40.683
I am forced to confess

02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:43.804
My tears flow

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:05.724
Su San! Do you understand your sin?

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:11.924
Do you understand your sin?

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:19.569
Do you understand your sin?

02:06:20.305 --> 02:06:26.279
