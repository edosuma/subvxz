<i>For 20 years,
Reeves Industries has been</i>

00:19.820 --> 00:22.150
<i>at the forefront of the
high-tech revolution.</i>

00:22.150 --> 00:23.085
<i>In fields as diverse</i>

00:23.085 --> 00:24.786

00:24.786 --> 00:26.512

00:41.180 --> 00:42.646
I think we can stop there.

00:42.649 --> 00:43.972
You guys get the idea, right?

00:43.972 --> 00:48.143
$120 billion company,
I'm a genius, et cetera.

00:48.143 --> 00:49.945
All stuff that you know.
I just wanted to make sure

00:49.945 --> 00:51.179
that you got to see the part

00:51.179 --> 00:53.282
where my face comes
out of molten titanium.

00:53.282 --> 00:54.716
Oh, gosh, I love that.

00:54.716 --> 00:56.518
All right, so...

00:56.518 --> 00:59.662
why did I drag a couple
dozen oil company executives

00:59.665 --> 01:02.310
to the middle of nowhere?
To watch movies?

01:02.313 --> 01:03.191
No.

01:03.191 --> 01:04.992
It's because you have a problem.

01:04.992 --> 01:08.063
Oil... well... fires.

01:08.063 --> 01:10.465
Just one of those bad boys

01:10.465 --> 01:13.869
costs millions... and it's not
just about the money, either.

01:13.869 --> 01:17.118
It's about putting your
employees in danger.

01:17.121 --> 01:18.106
Like this.

01:25.147 --> 01:28.309
Stay calm... it's all
part of the presentation.

01:28.312 --> 01:29.518
Ah, now,

01:29.518 --> 01:32.354
when there is a fire,
what do you do about it?

01:32.354 --> 01:34.122
You send your guys in,

01:34.122 --> 01:37.092
somehow get dynamite

01:37.092 --> 01:40.329
close to the
thousand-degree flame,

01:40.329 --> 01:43.198
detonate it, cross your fingers that

01:43.198 --> 01:45.167
the shock wave will snuff out the blaze.

01:45.167 --> 01:47.869
It's expensive, it's
dirty, it's ineffective.

01:47.869 --> 01:49.972
We can do better.

01:55.110 --> 01:57.145
Introducing...

01:57.145 --> 01:59.715
the Reeves TK421.

01:59.715 --> 02:01.950
All right, you've seen drones.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.018
Folks...

02:03.018 --> 02:05.854
this is not just a drone.

02:05.854 --> 02:08.991
Stays airborne for 36 hours.

02:09.167 --> 02:12.336
Operates at temperatures
up to 1,700 degrees.

02:12.336 --> 02:15.339
It also carries an
exclusive Reeves Industries

02:15.339 --> 02:17.275
concussive charge.

02:17.275 --> 02:20.511
Which means, if you have an oil fire,

02:20.511 --> 02:23.281
you can do this.

02:44.936 --> 02:46.838
Look at that.

02:46.838 --> 02:47.939
Look, look.

02:47.939 --> 02:49.140
Still flying.

02:49.140 --> 02:51.209
Still flying.

02:51.209 --> 02:54.145
Ada here is my CTO.

02:54.145 --> 02:58.316
She'll answer any technical
questions and take orders.

02:58.316 --> 03:00.484

What is it? What is it?

04:09.529 --> 04:11.665
It's the same thing every
time. You get all excited

04:11.665 --> 04:14.167

you put on a big show,

04:14.167 --> 04:16.039

I'm sorry for inventing
an amazing drone.

04:18.338 --> 04:20.339
Next time I'll do something

04:20.339 --> 04:22.242
really boring for you, all right?

04:22.242 --> 04:22.906
Hmm.

04:22.909 --> 04:24.945
Adam, could we pull off up here, please?

04:24.945 --> 04:26.580
Hmm?

04:26.580 --> 04:28.682
Well, I... I need a smoke.

04:28.682 --> 04:30.951
What, in this area?

04:30.951 --> 04:32.101
Also, you quit.

04:32.104 --> 04:33.920
I'm punishing myself.
I'm poisoning myself

04:33.920 --> 04:35.455
for being a bad person.

04:35.455 --> 04:36.957
Right.

04:40.293 --> 04:42.295
Ah...

04:42.295 --> 04:43.663
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:43.663 --> 04:45.465
Uh...

04:45.465 --> 04:48.435
- pack of Reds, please.
- Sure.

04:48.435 --> 04:49.936
...quickly over to the right,

04:49.936 --> 04:51.538
dribbling up to the
side corner, where...

04:51.538 --> 04:54.341
Keep the change.

04:55.849 --> 04:57.944
And the pack.

04:57.944 --> 04:59.346
Uh, lighters.

04:59.346 --> 05:01.148
- Over there.
- Yeah.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.488
The money.

05:08.488 --> 05:09.939
Now!

05:12.065 --> 05:13.734
I said now!

05:16.897 --> 05:18.324
The safe.

05:19.105 --> 05:20.667
I-I can't open the safe.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.135
- Don't play games, man.
- I'm not playing games.

05:22.135 --> 05:23.270
No games.

05:23.270 --> 05:24.905
911. Hold, please.

05:24.905 --> 05:26.106
Hold?

05:26.106 --> 05:27.340
There's an armed robbery.

05:28.775 --> 05:30.677
The operator
will be with you shortly.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.141
What are you doing?

05:32.913 --> 05:34.981
Huh?!

05:34.981 --> 05:37.144
911? You call the cops?

05:37.147 --> 05:39.249
Hey! Stay there, man!

05:39.252 --> 05:41.321
Don't move!

05:41.321 --> 05:42.956
Whoa, stay there.

05:42.956 --> 05:44.118
Whoa, listen, listen...

05:45.859 --> 05:47.160
Don't move, man!

05:47.160 --> 05:48.195
Wait.

05:48.195 --> 05:50.718
It's, like, a grand.

05:50.721 --> 05:51.698
Just...

05:51.698 --> 05:53.366
just go.

05:53.366 --> 05:56.607
You got to be worth a
lot more than that, man.

06:10.150 --> 06:12.152
Whoa! Whoa, Sully, Sully!

06:15.121 --> 06:16.289
Okay.

06:16.289 --> 06:17.557
Oh. All right.

06:17.557 --> 06:19.059
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:19.059 --> 06:22.255
911. What's your emergency?

06:22.258 --> 06:24.094
Sir?

06:24.097 --> 06:26.132
I need you to tell me what is going...

06:26.132 --> 06:27.601
Uh, yeah.

06:27.601 --> 06:30.136
I need help. My friend has been shot.

06:30.136 --> 06:32.489
Where the hell are you people?

06:37.911 --> 06:39.913
Is there anything
else you remember?

06:39.913 --> 06:43.183
Maybe something you mentioned
to the 911 dispatch...

06:43.183 --> 06:45.752
Yeah, she put me on hold.

06:45.752 --> 06:47.988
Right. You mentioned that.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.763
Uh, I'll be honest, Mr. Reeves.

06:50.766 --> 06:52.435
I'm sorry, but there's not much

06:52.435 --> 06:55.504
we can do with this.

06:55.504 --> 06:58.374
What about surveillance cameras? Hairs?

06:58.374 --> 06:59.775
Fingerprints?

06:59.775 --> 07:01.877
Don't you have a team
that you can, like...

07:01.877 --> 07:03.822
Forensics?
- call in?

07:03.825 --> 07:05.514
You got to go uptown for that.

07:05.514 --> 07:07.650
Look... we did a check...

07:07.653 --> 07:10.307
there wasn't much.
And even if there was,

07:10.310 --> 07:12.121
it takes eight months...

07:12.121 --> 07:13.989
How the hell am I supposed to
pick him up without a warrant?

07:13.989 --> 07:16.459
- I think that wraps us up.
- I told you!

07:16.459 --> 07:18.727
- I faxed it over!
- Need you to sign, please.

07:18.727 --> 07:20.296
Just got to make some copies.

07:20.296 --> 07:22.097
Hames transferred
out this morning.

07:22.097 --> 07:24.333
Guess you're running solo now, kid.

07:28.771 --> 07:30.306
Hey.

07:32.336 --> 07:33.937
You all right there?

07:36.111 --> 07:37.680
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:38.747 --> 07:41.517
You know, that was my beat.

07:41.517 --> 07:44.253
That area around the liquor store.

07:44.253 --> 07:46.522
I heard what happened.

07:47.356 --> 07:48.958
Well...

07:48.958 --> 07:51.661
looks like the investigation's
off to a great start.

07:52.328 --> 07:54.129
Karnes got downsized

07:54.129 --> 07:55.164
in the budget cuts.

07:55.164 --> 07:56.661
He's gone by the 15th.

07:56.664 --> 07:58.133
Oh, that explains things.

07:58.133 --> 08:00.369
Somehow I sensed I
wasn't getting his A game.

08:01.470 --> 08:03.105
Yeah, when you play with no equipment

08:03.105 --> 08:04.340
and no one in the stands,

08:04.340 --> 08:06.175
you tend to lose your
A game pretty quick.

08:09.278 --> 08:11.514
It's, uh, it's no excuse.

08:11.514 --> 08:13.716
I'm sorry about your friend.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.393
<i>And we anticipate
building 500 more units</i>

08:28.396 --> 08:29.674
<i>by fall of 2018.</i>

08:29.677 --> 08:30.596
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:30.599 --> 08:33.168
The executive committee will
take a look and discuss it

08:33.168 --> 08:35.938
at the next full council
meeting. Thank you.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.339
- Thank you, Mayor.
- Next up,

08:37.339 --> 08:39.674
we have a bit of a celebrity.

08:39.674 --> 08:41.243
Mr. Gideon Reeves

08:41.243 --> 08:43.078
of Reeves Industries.

08:43.078 --> 08:45.414
He'll be making a presentation for us.

08:45.414 --> 08:46.949
- Welcome, Mr. Reeves.
- Thank you,

08:46.949 --> 08:49.184
- Mr. Mayor.
- Oh, before you begin,

08:49.184 --> 08:51.921
may I say how sorry I was to have heard

08:51.921 --> 08:53.422
of the tragedy, and I would like...

08:53.422 --> 08:55.090
You want to personally extend
your deepest condolences.

08:55.090 --> 08:57.923
Oh, boy, I've heard that
speech so many times,

08:57.926 --> 09:00.195
I know it by heart.

09:00.195 --> 09:01.767
Here's what I haven't heard is...

09:01.770 --> 09:03.772
a real plan that might
lead to an arrest.

09:06.177 --> 09:08.980
My friend was killed
a month and a half ago,

09:08.980 --> 09:11.684
and since then, the 13th district

09:11.687 --> 09:13.651
has been too busy laying off cops

09:13.651 --> 09:15.954
to even mount an investigation.

09:15.954 --> 09:18.923
They have no suspects, they
have no leads, they have

09:18.923 --> 09:20.258
- no manpower to find any.
- Mr. Reeves,

09:20.258 --> 09:22.327
if you're having issues
with our police force,

09:22.327 --> 09:23.962
there are avenues that you could take.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.770
Oh, I've been down those avenues.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.741
Expressways, even.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.576
Know where they all lead?

09:29.576 --> 09:32.112
Straight into the
bureaucratic black hole

09:32.112 --> 09:34.543
that is your office, Mr. Mayor.

09:38.285 --> 09:40.354
I'm sorry you didn't get the response

09:40.354 --> 09:42.489
- that you were looking for.
- I don't want apologies.

09:44.425 --> 09:46.460
I want justice for Elliot James Sully.

09:48.362 --> 09:51.265
Who taught me how to ride a
skateboard when I was nine.

09:51.265 --> 09:54.501
And helped me break in
to the MIT physics lab

09:54.501 --> 09:56.303
when I was 16.

09:59.506 --> 10:02.109
And who gave his life
for mine six weeks ago.

10:02.109 --> 10:03.777
Mr. Reeves...

10:03.777 --> 10:06.480
I understand that you're upset,

10:06.480 --> 10:08.148
but it was my understanding

10:08.148 --> 10:09.984
that you were coming
before us with a proposal

10:09.984 --> 10:11.552
- of some kind.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

10:11.552 --> 10:13.454
I do. I have a proposal.

10:14.488 --> 10:18.225
Give me the 13th district to run.

10:21.695 --> 10:23.330
Excuse me?

10:23.330 --> 10:25.466
This city has a budget problem.

10:25.466 --> 10:28.469
You have an $89 million
unfunded pension obligation

10:28.469 --> 10:30.704
for the city's police department,

10:30.704 --> 10:32.706
and I have a checkbook right here.

10:32.706 --> 10:35.309
Other pocket. Here it is, here it is.

10:35.309 --> 10:37.311
I will personally fill that budget hole

10:37.311 --> 10:40.347
out of my own bank account, and
I will upgrade the 13th district

10:40.347 --> 10:42.349
to the best technology money can buy...

10:42.349 --> 10:44.351
or I can build, 'cause, you know,

10:44.351 --> 10:46.520
let's be honest, that's the good stuff.

10:48.155 --> 10:49.757
Mr. Reeves,

10:49.757 --> 10:52.526
a civilian cannot take over

10:52.526 --> 10:54.661
- a police district.
- Actually, they can,

10:54.661 --> 10:56.663
with a special appointment
from this committee.

10:56.663 --> 11:00.180
Um, here's the rest of my proposal.

11:00.183 --> 11:02.336
You turn me down, and I will finance

11:02.336 --> 11:04.371
all of your opponents
in the next election.

11:04.371 --> 11:05.906
And you can explain to the taxpayers

11:05.906 --> 11:09.343
why you turned down almost
$100 million in free money.

11:09.346 --> 11:11.191
And then when you lose,

11:11.194 --> 11:13.614
I will present the same
thing to the next mayor.

11:13.614 --> 11:15.082
Same checkbook.

11:15.082 --> 11:16.417
Different checks.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.386
Well.

11:19.386 --> 11:21.989
Proposals take time.

11:21.989 --> 11:23.557
Of course.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.959
Of course. How's eight
and a half minutes?

11:25.959 --> 11:28.162
- I have some reporters
outside. -30.

11:28.162 --> 11:30.497
I, I don't want to be rude.

11:32.312 --> 11:35.202
We've all seen revolutions
in a lot of industries.

11:35.202 --> 11:37.971
Computers, telecom.
Why not law enforcement?

11:37.971 --> 11:39.778
Mr. Reeves, what about other districts?

11:39.781 --> 11:41.374
This is a pilot program, right?

11:41.377 --> 11:44.966
I spent $2 billion on rockets
to start Reeves Aerospace.

11:44.969 --> 11:47.187
Most of them blew up, but eventually,

11:47.190 --> 11:49.560
we got a bird in orbit
and now that's the design

11:49.563 --> 11:50.751
that everybody copies.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.352
So it's the same thing.
It's the same thing here.

11:52.352 --> 11:54.154
You succeed in one district and, uh,

11:54.154 --> 11:55.422
the rest will follow.

11:56.557 --> 11:57.724
Mr. Reeves, you've been accused

11:57.724 --> 11:59.426
- of grandstanding.
- Thank you.

11:59.426 --> 12:00.928
What do you say to people who say

12:00.928 --> 12:03.097
this is just a publicity stunt?

12:03.097 --> 12:04.898
My best friend bled to death in my arms,

12:04.898 --> 12:07.167
and I want to find the
man that made that happen.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.103
You can call that a
publicity stunt if you want.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.505
I call it justice.

12:11.505 --> 12:14.274
You like that line? Is it a little much?

12:14.274 --> 12:16.594
No. It isn't. I like it. I
like it. Go with it. Go with it.

From what I'm hearing at city
hall, the mayor basically said

he'd facilitate transfers out of there.

Yeah, that's exactly

13:11.264 --> 13:13.099
You're still riding
around without a partner

13:13.099 --> 13:14.868

13:17.604 --> 13:18.605

Don't ask me.

14:15.662 --> 14:17.630

14:18.612 --> 14:20.466
What the hell are you
doing with my printer?

14:20.466 --> 14:22.948
It was garbage before I was born, man.

14:22.951 --> 14:24.519
Yeah, well, I know how to use it.

14:24.522 --> 14:25.990

14:28.808 --> 14:31.110

15:00.506 --> 15:02.675

15:02.675 --> 15:04.911
"Chicago deserves better

15:04.911 --> 15:07.079
than an arrogant, dilettante

15:07.082 --> 15:08.848
billionaire playing games with

15:08.848 --> 15:10.016
their safety."

15:10.016 --> 15:11.551
Well...

15:11.551 --> 15:12.919
I am arrogant.

15:12.919 --> 15:15.225
I am a billionaire.

15:15.228 --> 15:16.152
Dilettante?

15:16.155 --> 15:18.157
Yes. That, too.

15:18.157 --> 15:20.526
I'm one other thing
that they didn't mention.

15:20.526 --> 15:22.762
I'm an engineer.

15:22.762 --> 15:24.497
And, folks, we have got

15:24.497 --> 15:26.466
an engineering problem here.

15:26.466 --> 15:28.508
Let's do the math.

15:28.511 --> 15:33.036
13,289 cops in Chicago;

15:33.039 --> 15:36.342
2,869,121 people...

15:36.342 --> 15:40.772
which means each of
you protects and serves

15:40.775 --> 15:44.350
215.9 people.

15:44.350 --> 15:47.353
That's an impossible task.

15:47.353 --> 15:49.522
I'm here to make it possible.

15:49.522 --> 15:51.524
With this.

15:52.692 --> 15:56.629
The APB app allows citizens

15:56.629 --> 16:00.667
to call in real time
GPS-located crime reports

16:00.667 --> 16:04.284
from anywhere in the district.
You know those 215.9 people

16:04.287 --> 16:06.096
you're trying to serve and protect?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.041
They just became your partners.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.676
All right.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.377
Now for the good stuff.

16:11.377 --> 16:13.346
Ada.

16:16.049 --> 16:19.285
Silicon carbide disc body armor.

16:19.285 --> 16:21.487
It can stop any projectile traveling

16:21.487 --> 16:22.922
at 30 kilometers per second.

16:22.922 --> 16:26.992
That's 50 times faster
than the average bullet.

16:26.995 --> 16:29.464
And if the bad guys keep coming,

16:29.467 --> 16:33.367
we've upgraded your side arms to this.

16:34.634 --> 16:36.302
The next generation in Taser.

16:37.470 --> 16:39.939
The bad guys get toy guns, too?

16:40.973 --> 16:42.842
Actually not a toy, not a toy.

16:42.842 --> 16:47.313
I took the liberty of giving
my assistant Jeff a knife.

16:47.313 --> 16:50.283
Jeff, could you stab
me in the face please?

16:53.786 --> 16:55.321
Fine, it's all right.

16:55.321 --> 16:57.290
Don't worry, he's fine.

16:57.290 --> 16:59.692
Now you might be wondering,

16:59.692 --> 17:01.394
what about a gun at long range?

17:06.299 --> 17:07.867
Okay, all right.

17:07.867 --> 17:08.867
He's okay.

17:08.867 --> 17:10.169
I pay that guy a lot of money.

17:10.169 --> 17:12.405
This is just the beginning.

17:12.405 --> 17:14.640
I show you some of the
things I got, boom...

17:14.640 --> 17:17.076
your heads will explode,
brains everywhere.

17:17.076 --> 17:18.578
We don't have enough
paper towels for that.

17:18.578 --> 17:20.079
Let's just, let's get to questions.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.414
Yeah, I got one.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.184
Why is some rich guy
able to buy justice?

17:25.184 --> 17:29.172
Is crime only an issue
when it touches you?

17:29.175 --> 17:30.740
Cause we get, what?

17:30.743 --> 17:34.134
Ten unsolved murders a month?

17:36.329 --> 17:38.197
Where are their billionaires?

17:38.197 --> 17:39.966
Ouch. All right.

17:39.966 --> 17:42.020
Um, tough question.

17:42.023 --> 17:43.639
Maybe a little mean, but fair.

17:43.642 --> 17:45.249
Let me just make something clear here.

17:45.252 --> 17:47.006
Do I want the man who
killed Sully caught?

17:47.006 --> 17:50.109
Yeah, I do.

17:50.109 --> 17:52.353
But this is much bigger than that.

17:53.646 --> 17:55.548
This is about everybody who gets hurt

17:55.548 --> 17:58.651
when cops don't get the
resources to do the job.

17:58.651 --> 18:02.288
You guys are my partners

18:02.288 --> 18:05.328
in a new era of police...

18:06.893 --> 18:10.163
Barry, you're messing up my speech, man.

18:11.812 --> 18:13.366
All right, long story short...

18:13.366 --> 18:15.802
we're gonna change the world. Thanks.

18:17.937 --> 18:19.338
That's the safety.

18:19.338 --> 18:20.339
Turn it on here.

18:23.910 --> 18:26.512
Oh, yes. Yes.

18:30.149 --> 18:33.019
Hey, Murph-Murphy, right?

18:33.019 --> 18:34.487
Uh... yeah.

18:34.487 --> 18:35.755
Yeah.

18:35.755 --> 18:38.191
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:40.993 --> 18:43.996
Do you remember me?

18:43.996 --> 18:46.371
Yeah, I remember.

18:46.374 --> 18:48.167
I want your help with Sully's case.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.336
Were you not listening in there?

18:50.336 --> 18:51.337
Yeah, yeah.

18:51.337 --> 18:52.338
You know,

18:52.341 --> 18:54.308
when you're a guy like me,

18:54.311 --> 18:55.826
people tell you what you want to hear

18:55.829 --> 18:58.010
and I need someone who won't.

18:58.010 --> 19:00.179
Okay, but I'm not a detective.

19:00.179 --> 19:01.347
I've read your file.

19:01.347 --> 19:03.115
You've got all the
qualifications for detective

19:03.115 --> 19:04.483
and then some, so...

19:04.483 --> 19:06.886
Look, I really appreciate what
you're trying to do here...

19:06.886 --> 19:09.155
all this technology...

19:09.155 --> 19:11.157
but it doesn't solve cases, cops do.

19:11.157 --> 19:13.683
You haven't
met my technology.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.054
Just try it out.

19:15.057 --> 19:17.296
And you know, if I'm wrong,
then I will leave you alone.

19:17.296 --> 19:20.166
But if you like it, you'll help me out.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.167
Deal?

19:24.170 --> 19:25.905
- Deal.
- Okay.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.075
You must be kidding me.

19:34.078 --> 19:35.435
Okay.

19:38.184 --> 19:40.620
Meet your new cruisers.

19:40.620 --> 19:43.756
Each of these links back
to dispatch and the APB app

19:43.756 --> 19:45.625
that Gideon showed you earlier.

19:45.625 --> 19:49.585
We can monitor you from the
control center at all times.

19:52.164 --> 19:54.533
Now the chassis is armored

19:54.533 --> 19:57.536
with a proprietary Reeves
Industries ultra-hard alloy.

19:57.536 --> 19:59.772
It can handle anything under a 50 cal.

19:59.772 --> 20:01.674
Yeah. Why not?

20:01.674 --> 20:02.975
Wow.

20:19.109 --> 20:21.044
Whoa. Okay.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.068
Y'all good?

20:29.068 --> 20:31.237
Okay.

20:35.908 --> 20:37.510
And we're live.

20:37.510 --> 20:40.012
You nervous?

20:41.180 --> 20:43.149
Nope.

20:43.149 --> 20:45.151
Liar.

20:45.154 --> 20:47.016
<i>Yeah, look,
whatever. I'm just saying</i>

20:47.019 --> 20:48.732
that it feels like <i>Knight
Rider</i> or something,

20:48.734 --> 20:50.434
like it's gonna be
talking to me all the time.

20:50.436 --> 20:51.738
Yeah, well,

20:51.741 --> 20:53.844
it's better than me having
to talk to you all the time.

20:55.050 --> 20:57.824
Four blocks away.

20:57.827 --> 20:59.428
That's us.

20:59.431 --> 21:02.034
Hey, 1305,

21:02.034 --> 21:04.785
show us responding to a
possible assault in progress.

21:04.788 --> 21:05.938
Copy that, 1305.

21:05.938 --> 21:08.172
I got that when you pressed the button.

21:08.175 --> 21:10.076
Right.

21:26.255 --> 21:28.324
Where is he? The guy with the knife?

21:28.327 --> 21:29.685
APB. You texted us right?

21:29.688 --> 21:31.690
That was just, like, 30 seconds ago.

21:31.693 --> 21:32.861
Yeah, so where is he now?

21:32.864 --> 21:33.865
I don't know.

21:35.604 --> 21:37.406
Oh.

21:37.406 --> 21:39.266
- What's your name?
- Marshawn.

21:39.269 --> 21:41.343
Marshawn, there was no
dude with a knife, was there?

21:41.343 --> 21:42.943
You just wanted to
see if the app worked?

21:43.688 --> 21:45.781
Are you guys real cops?

21:45.781 --> 21:48.884
Oh, this is great.

21:48.884 --> 21:51.921
I'm gonna go shoot
myself with my fake gun.

21:55.366 --> 21:56.952
What? People...

21:56.955 --> 21:58.679
people want to see if it works.

22:03.899 --> 22:05.868
Theft report.

22:08.637 --> 22:10.072
What? Who is that?

22:10.072 --> 22:11.741
Who's, who's car 1309?

22:11.741 --> 22:12.808
It's Murphy.

22:12.808 --> 22:14.610
Okay, good.

22:22.251 --> 22:24.220
Car 1309 responding.

22:34.007 --> 22:35.942
Whoa.

22:37.733 --> 22:38.734
Suspect identified.

22:38.734 --> 22:39.769
In pursuit.

22:57.755 --> 22:59.757
♪ ♪

23:17.719 --> 23:19.254
Stay on the ground.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.681
Stay on the ground!

23:25.548 --> 23:27.316
You feel that? Feel
that thing on your face?

23:27.316 --> 23:28.517
That's the ground.

23:30.352 --> 23:32.384
Squad 1309, be advised, suspect is

23:32.387 --> 23:33.755
in custody.

23:36.892 --> 23:38.160
Great job.

23:38.163 --> 23:39.338
So, are you impressed

23:39.338 --> 23:40.696
with my technology?

23:40.696 --> 23:42.199
Do we have a deal?

23:42.202 --> 23:43.137
Maybe.

23:48.789 --> 23:50.360
<i>I mean, there's
clearly an upside to it.</i>

23:50.360 --> 23:51.664
<i>You just need to be more open.</i>

23:52.120 --> 23:53.952
Okay. Okay, so,

23:53.952 --> 23:55.587
Murphy got a good collar yesterday.

23:55.587 --> 23:56.788
Good for her.

23:56.788 --> 23:57.923
I don't know, Brandt.

23:57.923 --> 23:59.124
I mean, that app thing

23:59.124 --> 24:00.959
helped Murphy book a
smash-and-grab yesterday.

24:00.959 --> 24:02.160
I mean, when was the last time

24:02.160 --> 24:03.795
we did more than hang paper on it?

24:03.795 --> 24:05.397
That was one arrest.

24:05.397 --> 24:07.566
In the meantime, we got
three negative contacts

24:07.566 --> 24:09.568
and two homeless guys
fighting over a shopping cart.

24:09.568 --> 24:11.503
What, what? Like we never
had a day like that before?

24:11.503 --> 24:12.938
I mean, hell, I get calls

24:12.938 --> 24:14.823
on those same homeless
dudes all the time.

24:16.942 --> 24:18.510
You see that?

24:18.510 --> 24:20.280
You see that right there?
That's what I'm talking about.

24:20.282 --> 24:21.943
Same area, same call.

24:21.946 --> 24:23.248
Probably the same kid.

24:30.259 --> 24:32.390
You think this is funny?

24:32.390 --> 24:33.725
- You wasting our time?
- Brandt, stand down.

24:33.725 --> 24:34.626
You think this is a game?

24:34.626 --> 24:36.053
- Give me the phone.
- Brandt,

24:36.056 --> 24:38.430
I said stand down.

24:38.430 --> 24:40.565
I told you to stop playing around!

24:40.565 --> 24:41.933
Who's in there?

24:41.933 --> 24:44.402
My dad.

24:49.462 --> 24:51.977
I ain't that guy, right?

24:51.977 --> 24:53.579
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

24:56.513 --> 24:57.996
Police, hey!

25:04.456 --> 25:06.391
Stay down.

25:11.830 --> 25:14.633
You are under arrest. You got the right

25:14.633 --> 25:16.768
to remain silent. Anything you say or do

25:16.768 --> 25:18.170
can and will be used against you

25:18.170 --> 25:20.739
in a court of law.

25:20.739 --> 25:22.680
How is this
investigation of yours

25:22.683 --> 25:24.409
supposed to work if I'm on patrol duty?

25:24.409 --> 25:25.677
I talked to the captain.

25:25.677 --> 25:27.281
He's getting your shifts covered.

25:27.284 --> 25:29.414
You're on this until
we catch Sully's killer

25:29.414 --> 25:30.515
or till I go bankrupt.

25:30.515 --> 25:32.517
To be honest, I looked at Sully's case,

25:32.517 --> 25:33.785
and it's running really thin.

25:33.785 --> 25:34.920
Well, yeah.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.721
That was the old file, right?

25:36.721 --> 25:39.357
I've been working on a new one.

25:39.357 --> 25:42.794
You realize I spent, like, $100 million

25:42.794 --> 25:44.196
getting this police station, right?

25:44.196 --> 25:46.039
Did you think I was
just gonna poke around

25:46.042 --> 25:46.965
in your file cabinets?

25:46.965 --> 25:50.035
All right, here is what we know.

25:50.035 --> 25:52.437
A white male, five
ten to six foot, mask,

25:52.437 --> 25:54.239
drives a white mid-'90s car.

25:54.239 --> 25:55.574
Yeah, there's a lot of those.

25:55.574 --> 25:57.218
Uh-huh. Uh, to be exact,

25:57.221 --> 25:59.411
just under 77,000 in greater Chicago.

25:59.411 --> 26:02.247
So, here are liquor store robberies

26:02.247 --> 26:04.416
with a bad guy fitting that description.

26:04.771 --> 26:05.905
That's better, right?

26:05.908 --> 26:06.985
Still too much noise.

26:06.985 --> 26:08.486
Not enough signal.

26:08.486 --> 26:11.171
Then, I read a study that says

26:11.174 --> 26:14.160
criminals tend to favor the same
color and make of getaway car.

26:14.163 --> 26:16.114
You know, you could have saved
yourself a lot of time reading

26:16.116 --> 26:18.248
if you just would've
asked anybody in here.

26:18.248 --> 26:20.332
So you factor that in and we have...

26:20.335 --> 26:21.496
right there.

26:21.499 --> 26:23.637
Now, I figure

26:23.640 --> 26:25.576
he's probably stealing cars,

26:25.579 --> 26:27.757
you know, near his home, right?

26:27.757 --> 26:29.025
Well, he's not taking a bus

26:29.025 --> 26:30.794
to Evanston to steal a getaway car.

26:30.794 --> 26:31.960
Exactly right.

26:31.963 --> 26:35.429
So you pull up cars stolen
within a day of the robberies

26:35.432 --> 26:36.633
and you get that.

26:38.453 --> 26:40.221
Not bad.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.236
And this is the good part.

26:42.239 --> 26:44.398
We monitor the area with drones

26:44.401 --> 26:46.843
and when we identify
the possible cars...

26:46.846 --> 26:47.425
whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:47.427 --> 26:49.174
No, you don't get it. This is, this is

26:49.177 --> 26:50.979
a million dollars in R&D, all right?

26:50.982 --> 26:53.484
Just leave your robots. Come with me.

26:55.934 --> 26:57.535
That area you found,

26:57.535 --> 27:00.238
cops have been working
that beat for 20 years,

27:00.238 --> 27:02.240
gathering any information
they thought would be useful.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.242
Gang intel, jail time,

27:04.242 --> 27:05.610
you name it.

27:06.745 --> 27:08.380
Okay, so we're searching

27:08.380 --> 27:09.659
for guys in the area with links

27:09.662 --> 27:11.097
to known car thieves

27:11.100 --> 27:12.605
or records of car theft.

27:13.585 --> 27:15.887
Definitely not him.

27:17.032 --> 27:18.857
- Not those two.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

27:18.857 --> 27:21.226
you don't know that,
'cause statistically,

27:21.226 --> 27:22.427
- recidivism rates...
- Gideon, Gideon,

27:22.427 --> 27:24.362
this is my job, okay?

27:24.362 --> 27:26.264
I know these people.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.782
Ramon here... Ramon found Jesus.

27:28.785 --> 27:30.787
He wouldn't pick a dime off a sidewalk.

27:30.790 --> 27:33.004
And Skeeter,

27:33.004 --> 27:35.186
well, Skeeter stole a car
and drove it off a bridge.

27:35.189 --> 27:37.175
I'm sorry,
that-that's not funny.

27:37.175 --> 27:39.077
It's not those two.

27:41.246 --> 27:43.848
These are our suspects.

27:51.890 --> 27:54.359
Okay, we've got last known
address and phone, the suspects

27:54.359 --> 27:55.460
in Sully's murder.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.062
Okay, good.

27:58.396 --> 28:00.585
Okay, everyone, we're
sending you information

28:00.588 --> 28:02.867
on a list of suspects now.

28:02.867 --> 28:04.569
Just remember,

28:04.569 --> 28:05.904
you're looking for a killer.

28:05.904 --> 28:07.372
Be careful.

28:07.372 --> 28:09.574
Yeah, 1305,

28:09.574 --> 28:11.042
show us responding at 1325 Camden.

28:11.042 --> 28:12.243
I'm on it.

28:12.243 --> 28:15.413
<i>Heading to 335 Blackburn.</i>

28:24.281 --> 28:27.251
So, how much faith do you have
in billionaire boy's computers?

28:27.254 --> 28:29.089
You know he can hear
you right now, right?

28:29.661 --> 28:31.062
I'm just saying.

28:31.062 --> 28:32.664
We're gonna be knocking
on doors all day.

28:32.664 --> 28:34.566
We're not gonna find
any killer car thieves.

28:36.067 --> 28:37.975
You got any intel on this guy?

28:37.978 --> 28:39.814
Name is Randal Hatcher.

28:39.817 --> 28:41.951
Priors for assault and attempted murder.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.257
Well, sounds like a bad guy,

28:43.259 --> 28:44.960
doesn't mean he killed Gideon's buddy.

28:44.963 --> 28:46.750
Hey, hold it. Reyes, Reyes.

28:46.753 --> 28:48.792
Hey, Rookie. Calm yourself.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.096
We're just knocking on the door.

28:51.282 --> 28:53.218
Mr. Hatcher?

28:53.218 --> 28:54.919
Police, open up.

28:56.688 --> 28:58.023
Police, open up!

28:59.057 --> 29:00.792
What was that?

29:02.961 --> 29:04.029
Suspect is fleeing.

29:04.029 --> 29:06.564
Suspect is fleeing.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.641
We're in pursuit!

29:22.047 --> 29:23.837
Damn it!

29:26.818 --> 29:28.420
We lost him.

29:33.158 --> 29:35.026
What the hell was that?

29:35.029 --> 29:36.810
Gideon, was that you?

29:36.810 --> 29:38.029
Yeah, that's me.

29:38.029 --> 29:39.097
Had it in the air.

29:39.097 --> 29:42.000
He's heading south toward Ellis.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.201
Had what in the air?

29:43.201 --> 29:45.536
Who cares? Just go. Just go. Go, go, go!

29:49.874 --> 29:52.010
All right, he just
entered a brick building

29:52.010 --> 29:53.912
at the corner of 78th and Ellis.

29:53.912 --> 29:55.680
Copy.

30:01.719 --> 30:03.521
Reyes,

30:03.521 --> 30:04.889
wait!

30:10.069 --> 30:11.538
He's headed upstairs.

30:11.541 --> 30:12.642
Hatcher!

30:14.866 --> 30:17.469
Come on, don't make this
worse than what it is.

30:19.237 --> 30:21.206
There, the window.

30:27.899 --> 30:29.467
He's upstairs, east side.

30:30.633 --> 30:32.440
Hatcher, give it up, man!

30:42.060 --> 30:43.328
Reyes! To your left!

30:46.998 --> 30:50.168
Go, go, go. I got it. All right,

30:50.168 --> 30:51.936
keep pressure on it, all
right? Stay with me, all right?

30:51.936 --> 30:53.805
We need an ambulance right now!

30:53.805 --> 30:55.273
We have an officer down! He's shot.

30:55.276 --> 30:57.178
Come on, buddy, I'm
here with you, all right?

30:57.178 --> 30:59.096
Gideon, do something!

30:59.099 --> 31:00.830
Come on, buddy, just
stay with me, okay?!

31:00.833 --> 31:02.573
Stay with me! It's gonna be fine!

31:07.566 --> 31:11.002
All right.

31:11.005 --> 31:14.008
Hey, you wanted to see me?

31:14.008 --> 31:15.810
We've got a situation on our hands.

31:15.810 --> 31:17.345
Folks around here are upset

31:17.345 --> 31:18.847
that a rookie cop went into a building

31:18.847 --> 31:21.671
on your boss's say-so and got shot.

31:21.674 --> 31:23.945
We've had requests for
transfers, and, oh, yeah.

31:26.354 --> 31:28.456
Found these.

31:28.456 --> 31:30.225
Just thought you should know.

31:30.225 --> 31:31.559
Great.

31:42.904 --> 31:44.539
Aah! Ow!

31:44.539 --> 31:46.307
Oh, God!

31:50.173 --> 31:52.380
Oh, hi. Uh, can I help you?

31:54.582 --> 31:55.431
So,

31:55.434 --> 31:57.048
some of the cops in the district...

31:57.051 --> 31:58.119
Want me gone?

31:58.119 --> 32:00.321
Yeah, I got that when, um,

32:00.321 --> 32:02.390
someone returned their Taser gun

32:02.390 --> 32:04.425
through the windshield of the Rolls.

32:05.927 --> 32:07.996
What are you doing?

32:07.996 --> 32:09.764
I am modifying the drone.

32:09.764 --> 32:12.066
Um, gave it

32:12.066 --> 32:15.169
a floodlight, 20,000 lumens.

32:15.169 --> 32:16.838
And a loudspeaker.

32:16.838 --> 32:19.674
And now, I'm trying to add

32:19.674 --> 32:21.242
a Taser projectile unit.

32:21.242 --> 32:23.511
Gideon, you should go home.

32:23.511 --> 32:25.380
Oh, my... Go home?

32:25.380 --> 32:27.348
Okay, Ada, Reyes should not have even

32:27.348 --> 32:28.716
been in that building, right?

32:28.716 --> 32:31.119
If we were able to
actually use this drone,

32:31.119 --> 32:32.696
he would be home with
his family right now.

32:32.698 --> 32:34.688
Yeah, but you realize that
none of this is gonna...

32:35.790 --> 32:37.525
Please don't say,

32:37.525 --> 32:39.594
"None of this is gonna
bring back Sully." Come on,

32:39.594 --> 32:43.064
you-you have a, you have
a Ph.D. from Cal Tech.

32:43.064 --> 32:44.659
You're better than that.

32:45.257 --> 32:46.959
Okay, man, I get it.

32:46.959 --> 32:48.360
You're upset.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.596
But the fact is Sully is gone.

32:50.596 --> 32:52.431
And you are gonna get
bored of playing cops,

32:52.431 --> 32:54.099
just like you got bored of aerospace,

32:54.099 --> 32:55.901
and you got bored of nanotech,

32:55.901 --> 32:57.403
- and you...
- Mr. Reeves?

32:57.403 --> 32:59.606
We need to ask you to come with us.

33:05.210 --> 33:08.147
<i>Oh, the silent
and intimidating thing</i>

33:08.147 --> 33:09.782
<i>makes for a fun drive.</i>

33:09.782 --> 33:11.317
<i>What are we doing here?</i>

33:17.656 --> 33:18.891
Mr. Mayor.

33:18.891 --> 33:20.692
You didn't return my call.

33:20.692 --> 33:24.363
Well, I've been a little busy.

33:24.363 --> 33:27.266
I heard you had some trouble earlier.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.700
And you thought you'd, uh,

33:28.700 --> 33:30.903
violate my civil rights to celebrate?

33:30.903 --> 33:35.207
Your carelessness and arrogance
got a police officer shot.

33:37.209 --> 33:40.913
So you brought me out here
to say that, why, exactly?

33:40.913 --> 33:42.915
Are we gonna go for a swim after?

33:42.915 --> 33:44.747
Or is it the view?

33:44.750 --> 33:45.551
Walk away.

33:45.551 --> 33:48.187
Make a statement about the challenges

33:48.187 --> 33:49.588
of police work,

33:49.588 --> 33:52.891
and express your support
for my administration.

33:52.891 --> 33:54.860
Maybe you should just
skip to what happens

33:54.860 --> 33:56.862
if I do none of that.

34:00.098 --> 34:04.236
I will come at you with
everything that I've got.

34:04.236 --> 34:06.705
You've got one police district.

34:06.705 --> 34:09.208
I have 21.

34:09.208 --> 34:12.244
Do the math, genius.

34:27.429 --> 34:28.895
Hey.

34:28.898 --> 34:30.693
Hi there.

34:30.696 --> 34:31.996
You slept here?

34:31.996 --> 34:33.599
Ah, I was working on something.

34:33.599 --> 34:36.034
Figured I'd... try to...

34:36.034 --> 34:38.070
I don't know... make this right somehow.

34:38.070 --> 34:41.039
Look, I, um...

34:41.039 --> 34:44.386
I know a lot of people here
blame you for what happened...

34:44.389 --> 34:47.300
I believe you mean the
entire police force blames me.

34:47.303 --> 34:50.516
Do you even know who the
"police force" is, Gideon?

34:50.516 --> 34:52.914
I mean, they're a bunch of
scared, screwed-up people

34:52.917 --> 34:54.797
who come to work every morning wondering

34:54.800 --> 34:56.641
if today's the day that they get shot.

34:56.643 --> 34:59.958
We're not some engineering
problem you can just fix.

34:59.958 --> 35:02.394
Look, Reyes?

35:02.394 --> 35:05.097
He was fired up.

35:05.097 --> 35:08.868
I tried to call him back,
but... he was careless.

35:11.203 --> 35:12.638
The mayor dragged me out

35:12.638 --> 35:14.873
for a romantic meeting last night.

35:14.873 --> 35:16.595
He wants to shut me down.

35:17.661 --> 35:20.230
Well, you're not shut down yet.

35:20.230 --> 35:21.765
And look, the only

35:21.765 --> 35:24.735
shot that we have at
catching this bastard

35:24.735 --> 35:26.236
is the APB app.

35:26.236 --> 35:28.538
We tried... Ada sent
Hatcher's mug shot out

35:28.538 --> 35:30.173
to every user in the city.

35:30.173 --> 35:32.075
Look, when we are after a drug dealer,

35:32.075 --> 35:34.078
we don't talk to regular citizens.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.247
We work our contacts.

35:37.247 --> 35:39.216
<i>You want
information on criminals,</i>

35:39.216 --> 35:41.753
<i>you need other criminals using the app.</i>

35:41.756 --> 35:44.388
<i>They're the ones that
know what's going on.</i>

35:44.388 --> 35:46.623
<i>We got to get out there,
tell them we need help</i>

35:46.623 --> 35:49.526
<i>finding the guy that killed
Elliot Sully and shot Reyes.</i>

35:49.526 --> 35:51.194
<i>And when we catch him,</i>

35:51.194 --> 35:52.963
<i>we're gonna remember who had our backs</i>

35:52.963 --> 35:55.198
<i>and who didn't.</i>

35:55.198 --> 35:57.234
<i>That's how it works at Chicago PD.</i>

35:57.234 --> 36:00.203
<i>Your computers are great, Gideon,</i>

36:00.203 --> 36:02.806
<i>but you've got to let the
cops do their job first.</i>

36:08.645 --> 36:11.281
I ran a regression analysis
on the Hatcher sightings

36:11.281 --> 36:14.384
over the last six hours,
and as you can see,

36:14.384 --> 36:18.055
we have been getting stuff,
but a lot of it is just garbage,

36:18.055 --> 36:19.389
people seeing shadows.

36:19.389 --> 36:21.058
We could up our patrol.

36:21.058 --> 36:22.636
I'm not sure we have the manpower.

36:23.934 --> 36:24.969
Hang on.

36:24.972 --> 36:25.762
Hang on!

36:25.762 --> 36:28.265
Uh... can I borrow this?

36:28.265 --> 36:29.700
So...

36:29.700 --> 36:32.002
pull everything that fits

36:32.002 --> 36:34.104
in a random distribution,

36:34.104 --> 36:36.239
'cause garbage would be
evenly distributed, right?

36:36.239 --> 36:39.343
But-but, like, real sightings
would come in tighter clusters.

36:41.178 --> 36:42.546
Okay, this is four hours ago.

36:42.546 --> 36:44.081
Where? Okay.

36:45.682 --> 36:47.217
Three...

36:47.217 --> 36:48.752
Yep.

36:48.752 --> 36:50.655
Now, two.

36:53.050 --> 36:54.618
Then half an hour ago.

36:56.059 --> 36:57.561
All right!

36:57.561 --> 36:59.296
So...

36:59.296 --> 37:00.197
so-so he's moving.

37:00.197 --> 37:01.431
We can work with that.

37:01.431 --> 37:02.822
What did you just do, girl?

37:02.825 --> 37:04.427
It's just a filtering algorithm.

37:08.601 --> 37:09.737
What's it say?

37:09.740 --> 37:11.408
Men shouting. Someone fired a gun.

37:11.408 --> 37:13.713
That's... Okay, location?

37:13.716 --> 37:16.653
Hang on. It's still bouncing
around the cell towers.

37:20.050 --> 37:21.885
It's northeast, across the river.

37:26.972 --> 37:27.973
Wow.

37:36.605 --> 37:38.444
Okay, a call just came
through from an apartment

37:38.446 --> 37:40.476
building on East 75th and Cramler.

37:40.476 --> 37:42.311
Men arguing, shots fired.

37:42.311 --> 37:43.746
Is it Hatcher?

37:43.746 --> 37:45.414
I mean, I can't be sure, but based on

37:45.414 --> 37:46.749
his past location and movements,

37:46.749 --> 37:48.250
it's a high probability.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.452
It's good enough for me.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.592
75th and Cramler.

37:56.592 --> 37:57.860
There.

38:03.432 --> 38:05.601
Hey, do we have a floor, or...?

38:05.601 --> 38:07.202
No just an address.

38:17.894 --> 38:19.195
I told you to get...

38:21.899 --> 38:23.334
Hey, boost the audio.
