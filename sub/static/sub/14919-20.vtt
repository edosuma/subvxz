00:06.372 --> 00:08.848
Justin is not gonna want
to sit next to the family.

00:08.849 --> 00:11.083
He's gonna want
three hot bridesmaids,

00:11.084 --> 00:13.729
- of which I have none.
- I like your style.

00:13.730 --> 00:16.167
Hmm? Oh. I'm just trying
to break them in.

00:16.168 --> 00:18.521
Two more days schlepping
around in these puppies,

00:18.522 --> 00:20.481
and I'll feel like I'm walking down

00:20.482 --> 00:23.037
- the aisle in my slippers.
- What are you doing up so early?

00:23.038 --> 00:24.956
- Hmm? Ohh.
- Thank you.

00:24.957 --> 00:27.246
The sudoku chart from hell.

00:27.247 --> 00:31.017
Look at this.
She doesn't talk to him.

00:31.018 --> 00:32.454
She needs to be
near the bathroom.

00:32.455 --> 00:33.948
He won't stand
for being at the back--

00:33.949 --> 00:35.711
Okay, Sarah, it's 5:00 A.M.

00:35.712 --> 00:38.680
- What are you really doing up?
- I couldn't sleep.

00:40.027 --> 00:41.617
I'm worried about mom.

00:41.951 --> 00:43.862
I could kill Brody.

00:43.863 --> 00:46.935
He really broke her heart.

00:46.936 --> 00:50.017
Look, le temps gurit
les blessures. Ã‡a va?

00:50.018 --> 00:52.985
Don't make me pretend
I know what that means.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.502
- You know Lisa from accounting?
- Mm-hmm.

00:55.503 --> 00:59.055
She just got over
the worst heartbreak ever.

00:59.056 --> 01:01.056
You know what she said
really helped?

01:01.057 --> 01:03.362
Spirit-rejuvenating activities.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.447
Don't make me pretend
I understand that either.

01:05.447 --> 01:09.224
Oh, she made a quilt.
She took a tap class, went on a cruise.

01:09.225 --> 01:11.788
Maybe I should do
something like that with mom.

01:11.789 --> 01:13.147
What, you want
to float away on a boat

01:13.148 --> 01:14.781
two weeks before the wedding?

01:16.166 --> 01:19.758
Yeah. You're right. Crazy.
Damn Kevin!

01:19.759 --> 01:22.574
You know, he clearly said he
wanted to organize our wedding,

01:22.575 --> 01:23.904
and I know this thing has tabs,

01:23.905 --> 01:27.501
but you can't just hand me
a ring binder and then go AWOL!

01:28.265 --> 01:30.342
Look, I still have
two fittings for my dress,

01:30.343 --> 01:31.538
confirm numbers with the caterer,

01:31.539 --> 01:33.844
get programs printed,
finalize, order flowers--

01:33.845 --> 01:36.163
I mean, Kevin was supposed
to do most of this.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.478
I can help you. It's fine.

01:37.479 --> 01:39.654
No, you can't.
You have your own tab.

01:39.655 --> 01:43.757
Wow. Well, maybe someone else
can rejuvenate with your mom.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.691
Who? Kitty and Seth
are still in Boston,

01:45.692 --> 01:47.085
and if Kevin's gonna help anybody,

01:47.086 --> 01:48.952
- it's gonna be me.
- What about Justin?

01:48.953 --> 01:52.517
Oh, no. Justin's idea
of reviving a spirit--

01:52.518 --> 01:54.618
watching "Ghostbusters."

01:54.619 --> 01:57.620
Nope.
It's gotta be me.

01:57.621 --> 02:00.360
I don't want to be worried about
my mom on my wedding day.

02:00.361 --> 02:01.177
Why don't you ask your mom

02:01.178 --> 02:03.221
- to help you with the wedding stuff?
- Oh, genius!

02:03.222 --> 02:06.324
Two birds, one stone.
I'll have her over for lunch today,

02:06.325 --> 02:08.678
and she can solve this
Rubik's cube of the seating.

02:08.679 --> 02:11.749
Uh, no lunch.
Don't want you here at lunchtime.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.220
Luc, you're supposed to

02:13.221 --> 02:16.062
make up a cover
if you have a surprise.

02:16.063 --> 02:19.080
Why would I want to cover it
when I can torture you instead?

02:19.081 --> 02:21.391
Ooh. Love it.

02:22.087 --> 02:25.193
The last few days
you've been pretty gloomy.

02:25.288 --> 02:28.090
Well, I'm all over that.
Now I'm just pissed.

02:28.091 --> 02:29.281
That's great. That's great.

02:29.282 --> 02:32.927
That means you're progressing
through the stages of grief.

02:32.928 --> 02:36.255
Yeah, I'm progressing
right up the 5 to the 99.

02:36.928 --> 02:38.195
What do you mean?

02:38.196 --> 02:41.885
I mean, I'm going to drive
to Fresno and confront Brody.

02:41.886 --> 02:45.189
I want him to look me in the face
and tell me the truth.

02:46.282 --> 02:48.362
Uh, what truth?

02:48.363 --> 02:50.887
The truth about why!
Why all of this?

02:50.888 --> 02:53.254
Why did he come here?
Why did he leave?

02:53.255 --> 02:57.067
Brody wanted me. He pursued me.
He cooked dinner for me.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.548
He asked me to go
on the road with him.

02:58.549 --> 03:02.409
- Okay, mom, but, you know,
guys--guys do that. - Not Brody.

03:02.617 --> 03:05.847
Justin, his face would light up
every time I came into a room.

03:05.848 --> 03:08.666
I-I could feel his heart beating
faster when I got near him.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.330
It was practically
jumping out of his shirt.

03:11.331 --> 03:14.241
If he doesn't love me,
then I'm crazy, and--and fine!

03:14.242 --> 03:16.963
If I am, then--
then just commit me!

03:19.795 --> 03:20.760
Um...

03:22.026 --> 03:23.194
What?

03:23.445 --> 03:25.578
- No, it, uh, it--it--
- What?

03:25.579 --> 03:26.268
Nothing.

03:26.269 --> 03:27.517
Justin?

03:29.769 --> 03:31.461
Okay, mom, look, you're...

03:32.687 --> 03:34.185
You're not wrong.

03:34.634 --> 03:36.523
He-- he does love you.

03:37.757 --> 03:39.426
How do you know that?

03:40.298 --> 03:42.914
B-because there, um...

03:42.915 --> 03:44.538
I mean, there's a chance--

03:44.539 --> 03:46.939
- Spit it out!
- Okay, mom, he lied about his blood type.

03:47.651 --> 03:49.136
- He what?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, mom.

03:49.137 --> 03:50.560
You asked me to spit it out,
so I spit it out.

03:50.638 --> 03:52.704
He lied about his blood type.
I saw his medical records,

03:52.837 --> 03:58.449
- and then I went and confronted him
about it. - Oh, my God.

03:58.450 --> 03:59.909
I'm sorry. Mom, I'm sorry.
Just--okay, just--

03:59.910 --> 04:01.200
Oh, my God.

04:03.126 --> 04:06.709
Are you saying
that he's Sarah's father?

04:06.710 --> 04:07.491
No, I'm not, mom.

04:07.492 --> 04:11.729
I'm saying that he--
he might be Sarah's father.

04:11.730 --> 04:14.443
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

04:14.444 --> 04:16.668
This was easier when I just
thought he didn't love me.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.158
I know. That's exactly why
he didn't want to tell you, mom,

04:18.252 --> 04:20.218
or b-because he didn't want
to get you upset.

04:20.219 --> 04:23.767
- So, you know, this may not even be true.
- We have to find out.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.201
What do you mean, we have to--
what,

04:25.202 --> 04:27.238
- are you gonna tell Sarah?
- No.

04:27.239 --> 04:30.930
- So what-- what are you gonna do,
a covert D.N.A. test, mom? - Yes.

04:31.149 --> 04:32.410
- What?
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

04:32.411 --> 04:33.733
- How are you gonna do--
- Don't say anything!

04:33.837 --> 04:35.272
Don't say anything!
I have to think.

04:35.273 --> 04:39.692
I have to think.
I-I have one of Brody's baseball caps,

04:39.693 --> 04:41.689
and it's easy enough for us
to get something

04:41.816 --> 04:42.915
- from Sarah's house.
- No. No, no.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.426
You said "us." I'm out, mom.
I'm not doing it.

04:44.427 --> 04:45.380
- I'm not gonna do it. Nope.
- All right.

04:45.381 --> 04:47.068
Fine. Fine.
Then I will go to Sarah's house

04:47.069 --> 04:49.828
all by myself, but I need
your help through this, Justin.

04:49.829 --> 04:51.752
You can't just lay this on me
and walk away!

04:51.753 --> 04:54.885
Mom, I-I'm sorry.
I-I-I 100% should've told you sooner,

04:54.960 --> 04:56.057
but Brody swore me to secrecy,

04:56.058 --> 05:00.294
and I don't even know if I did
the right thing by telling you.

05:03.246 --> 05:04.550
Oh, hi, Saul. Come in.

05:04.551 --> 05:06.026
I'm sorry to barge in
on you like this, but--

05:06.120 --> 05:07.953
No, not at all. I was just, um...

05:07.954 --> 05:11.010
Actually, what do you think
would cheer mom up more--

05:11.011 --> 05:13.037
running the caterer,
the photographer,

05:13.128 --> 05:15.586
- or the printer? - Well, you know,
your mother's very much like me,

05:15.587 --> 05:18.104
so as long as you're standing
next to her and smiling,

05:18.265 --> 05:19.878
she'd be very happy.

05:21.132 --> 05:23.344
So, honeybunch...

05:24.791 --> 05:26.541
I brought something for you.

05:29.877 --> 05:32.483
Okay, so here's the story--

05:32.484 --> 05:34.226
a few days after your dad died,

05:34.227 --> 05:37.412
Nora found this dry cleaning ticket
on his desk,

05:37.413 --> 05:39.960
and she couldn't bring
herself to go, so I went,

05:39.961 --> 05:43.031
and I expected to see
a couple of suits maybe,

05:43.032 --> 05:46.694
but it was a perfectly pressed
stack of handkerchiefs.

05:47.622 --> 05:49.298
So William, huh?

05:49.299 --> 05:51.352
- Mm.
- Anyway, Nora said that I should have it,

05:51.353 --> 05:53.061
'cause William would've
wanted me to have it,

05:53.062 --> 05:54.925
- 'cause it's an old guy kind of thing...
- Oh.

05:54.926 --> 05:57.532
And I felt that maybe
that would be a perfect thing

05:57.533 --> 06:00.092
for your something blue.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.611
Oh, Saul.

06:05.345 --> 06:06.725
Thank you.

06:06.726 --> 06:09.981
- You're welcome, darling.
- You know, when you walked in just now,

06:11.038 --> 06:11.875
I... for a second I thought

06:11.876 --> 06:14.073
it was the most
normal thing in the world

06:14.074 --> 06:16.192
for you just to come into my office.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.322
I miss that.

06:20.323 --> 06:22.223
Yeah, I miss it, too.

06:23.237 --> 06:25.307
Anyway, the handkerchief wasn't
the only thing I came about.

06:25.308 --> 06:27.826
- I wanted to talk to you
about something... - Oh, sure.

06:27.827 --> 06:30.605
And it's not the most
pleasant thing in the world,

06:30.606 --> 06:33.017
but, you know, your dad
wasn't just a sharp dresser.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.386
He was a sharp businessman,
and I think that

06:36.387 --> 06:39.427
he would've advised you and Luc
to sign a prenup.

06:39.428 --> 06:42.653
Oh, God. Saul, I can't believe
that you just said that.

06:42.734 --> 06:45.127
Listen to me, Sarah.
You worked very hard for this business.

06:45.128 --> 06:47.854
It should be protected.
That's sound business advice.

06:47.855 --> 06:50.478
- You know that. - Listen, I know
that everybody says that prenups

06:50.479 --> 06:53.194
are for second marriages,
because you learn your lesson

06:53.195 --> 06:56.083
the first time by how badly
you get screwed over,

06:56.157 --> 06:59.764
and I did with Joe,
and I did learn my lesson.

06:59.848 --> 07:03.226
I learned not to marry
the wrong man,

07:04.121 --> 07:06.403
and this time I'm not going to,

07:06.655 --> 07:10.280
so there is not going to be a prenup.

07:11.196 --> 07:12.145
Okay.

07:12.146 --> 07:12.945
Okay?

07:12.946 --> 07:14.038
Yep.

07:14.972 --> 07:16.227
Okay.

07:16.999 --> 07:18.346
Is there any way she could've

07:18.347 --> 07:21.434
- gotten on another flight?
- Uh, I doubt it. We checked.

07:21.435 --> 07:23.472
I think we can safely assume
she left the airport

07:23.473 --> 07:25.503
as soon as she knew
you'd spotted her with the baby.

07:25.504 --> 07:27.920
She ran like a thief,
which, of course, she is.

07:27.921 --> 07:30.023
Unfortunately,
the law hasn't kept up

07:30.024 --> 07:32.996
with the science of these
3-party surrogate births.

07:33.179 --> 07:35.848
To us it's kidnapping,
but the police treat it

07:35.849 --> 07:37.968
- as a custody issue.
- That's insane.

07:37.969 --> 07:39.438
I mean, she's not
even the egg donor.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.439
She is not genetically related
to that baby in any way.

07:42.639 --> 07:44.147
She lied to us
about the miscarriage.

07:44.239 --> 07:46.143
She took our money.
She stole our baby!

07:46.365 --> 07:48.763
Believe me, I know plenty
of people in the D.A.'s office.

07:48.764 --> 07:51.532
I will find the criminal statute
to charge her with.

07:52.728 --> 07:55.648
Are you saying that
the police are giving up?

07:55.850 --> 07:58.414
Let's just say,
it's not their top priority.

07:58.499 --> 07:59.570
But that's why we have you.

07:59.666 --> 08:03.386
And I will do everything I can,
but I want you to be realistic.

08:03.387 --> 08:06.493
After three days,
the odds are not with us.

08:06.494 --> 08:09.089
She could be anywhere, and
if she's gone back to New York,

08:09.090 --> 08:11.743
then it gets more complicated
and expensive.

08:12.203 --> 08:13.276
I'm not licensed there.

08:13.277 --> 08:14.549
I'd have to hire somebody to do the

08:14.550 --> 08:17.314
- legwork for me--
- So hire someone. Just keep going.

08:17.888 --> 08:22.183
Okay. I, um...

08:22.184 --> 08:24.878
got a copy of the New York state
birth certificate this morning,

08:24.879 --> 08:28.023
and his date of birth falls
right in the correct time frame.

08:28.024 --> 08:28.893
His?

08:30.804 --> 08:32.188
Yeah.

08:32.962 --> 08:34.528
She had a boy.

08:35.336 --> 08:37.243
His name is Daniel.

09:10.628 --> 09:12.611
I, uh, I like it.

09:12.612 --> 09:15.330
I mean, in a lullaby kind of way,
but I-I like it.

09:15.331 --> 09:18.821
Lullaby?
Lullaby.

09:19.589 --> 09:23.145
Okay, you want something
more up-tempo. Have at it, kid.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.532
Uh, I thought
we were picking together.

09:24.533 --> 09:25.488
Why don't you pick the song?

09:25.489 --> 09:26.779
Obviously, I don't know my niece

09:26.780 --> 09:28.255
- as well as I thought I knew her.
- If you don't want to do this,

09:28.256 --> 09:29.784
I have a guy
that plays the accordion.

09:29.785 --> 09:31.987
This is so silly,
me not telling you.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.856
It's like there's this big,
fat elephant in the room,

09:33.857 --> 09:36.565
- and you don't even see that it's there.
- What elephant, Saul?

09:36.566 --> 09:38.024
- Exactly.
- What?

09:38.025 --> 09:40.745
Come on. Sit down.
I want to talk to you. Come on.

09:42.023 --> 09:45.311
Okay, here's the deal--
I had a talk with Sarah this morning,

09:45.312 --> 09:47.792
and I suggested that
the two of you sign a prenup,

09:47.793 --> 09:50.082
- and she would not have any of it.
- What's a prenup?

09:50.083 --> 09:52.250
Prenup-- Prenuptial agreement
between two people

09:52.251 --> 09:54.530
before they get married.
It's just in case...

09:54.531 --> 09:58.526
- Oh. Oh. And she said no?
- Yes, she said no.

09:58.527 --> 10:01.387
She has these romantic ideals,
which I certainly respect,

10:01.388 --> 10:02.596
but I think it's important for people

10:02.597 --> 10:05.472
- to think practically in--
- That's so sweet that she said no.

10:05.473 --> 10:07.277
- Hello? Luc...
- Yeah.

10:07.278 --> 10:08.350
You're not listening to me.

10:08.351 --> 10:09.803
Well, what do you want me to say?
She said no, Saul.

10:09.804 --> 10:12.183
I think that you should
talk to her about this.

10:12.184 --> 10:14.293
I'm not gonna talk to my bride
two weeks before the wedding

10:14.294 --> 10:16.167
and ask her to sign
a piece of paper that say,

10:16.168 --> 10:18.404
"hey, we're probably
gonna get divorced."

10:18.609 --> 10:20.892
I can't believe you think
I'm gonna steal Sarah's money.

10:20.893 --> 10:22.721
Why is everybody
taking this the wrong way?

10:22.722 --> 10:24.830
There is any other way
to take it, Saul?

10:26.707 --> 10:27.937
Nora.

10:27.938 --> 10:31.310
- Hi. Come in.
- Hi.

10:31.311 --> 10:34.769
Hi. Luc, I-I, um...

10:34.770 --> 10:37.374
I thought you'd be up
in your studio, so I...

10:37.375 --> 10:40.229
- Oh, no.
- Saul, how are ya?

10:40.230 --> 10:42.845
- Hi. So you--you ventured out?
- Yeah.

10:42.846 --> 10:44.893
You know that Sarah's at work, right?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.944
Oh, yeah. I know that. I...

10:49.908 --> 10:52.373
- How are you? What are you doing?
- We're good.

10:52.374 --> 10:55.036
We're just actually prepping
a rehearsal. The guys are gonna

10:55.037 --> 10:57.417
- do this special number for Sarah
at the wedding. - Oh.

10:57.418 --> 10:59.752
Yeah, we thought that it would be
a great idea to do it now,

10:59.856 --> 11:01.401
since who knows how long
the marriage will last

11:01.402 --> 11:05.156
- after that?
- Yeah.

11:07.444 --> 11:09.070
I-I'm not gonna keep you at all.

11:09.071 --> 11:12.188
I just came by to borrow
Sarah's... turtleneck.

11:12.189 --> 11:14.787
Turtleneck?
It's 70 degrees outside, Nora.

11:14.788 --> 11:17.531
Oh, I know.
It-- but it's a-a fashion thing.

11:17.532 --> 11:19.931
- I need it for the--
- All right, Nora, stop, please, please.

11:19.932 --> 11:21.574
You don't have
to make excuses for us.

11:21.575 --> 11:24.028
Obviously you came here
because you wanted to talk.

11:24.029 --> 11:28.902
No, Saul! No! My neck is cold,
and Sarah's my daughter.

11:28.903 --> 11:30.957
We share clothes.
We've been doing it for 30 years,

11:30.958 --> 11:32.725
and some things just don't change.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.512
Thank God some things don't change.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.521
D-D-D.N.A.

11:41.459 --> 11:43.645
No, it can't be that.
Can't be it.

11:43.646 --> 11:44.774
Ahh.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.375
Ah!

11:47.479 --> 11:48.663
Ah.

11:54.701 --> 11:57.341
Nora, her turtlenecks
might be in the, uh...

11:58.404 --> 12:00.120
Are you okay?

12:02.271 --> 12:05.124
What did she say?
She said she was in the market

12:05.125 --> 12:08.772
for a new hairbrush and wanted
to see how ours handled.

12:08.874 --> 12:11.607
But it's a hairbrush.
It's not a Buick.

12:11.925 --> 12:13.747
This is so weird.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.301
What did she do
with the turtleneck?

12:16.302 --> 12:18.474
She never got one.
She just took off.

12:18.475 --> 12:21.569
Luc, I'm really thinking that
maybe I should do this cruise.

12:21.570 --> 12:26.720
Think about it--ocean, sunshine,
margaritas--a Mexican cleanse.

12:26.811 --> 12:29.271
This could be
exactly what she needs.

12:29.272 --> 12:30.799
Okay, but I-I-I don't-- I don't see

12:30.800 --> 12:32.308
I can't have her
falling apart at the wedding.

12:32.309 --> 12:33.953
This is obviously a cry for help.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.612
If I can get her alone, maybe
I can help her, just get her to,

12:36.613 --> 12:38.922
you know, talk it out or something.

12:39.297 --> 12:42.506
You might be okay with this,
but your mother will never

12:42.507 --> 12:43.804
agree to take you away
from the wedding stuff.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.497
Well, then I just--
I won't give her a chance.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.274
I will-- I will just get
everything ready,

12:47.275 --> 12:49.628
and then I'll just
shove her into a car.

12:50.056 --> 12:53.284
Oh, please, Luc, come on.
Back me up on this.

12:54.572 --> 12:55.651
Okay.

12:55.811 --> 12:57.561
Okay! Okay, then.

12:57.562 --> 13:00.377
Uh, well, now I am really busy,

13:00.378 --> 13:03.076
so I'm gonna hang up on you,
but I love you. Thank you.

13:04.573 --> 13:05.770
Whew.

13:05.949 --> 13:07.683
I really thought I knew Michelle.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.310
I mean, I-I liked her.
I mean, she seemed normal.

13:11.311 --> 13:13.756
I can't believe she would
turn into this monster.

13:13.757 --> 13:16.574
Yeah, well, obviously
we never really knew her.

13:16.669 --> 13:18.626
She could've been planning
this from the beginning.

13:18.706 --> 13:20.915
Look, I'm sorry
to unload this on you,

13:20.916 --> 13:22.659
but I can't face telling
the family right now,

13:22.660 --> 13:24.455
so I need you to cover
with mom and everybody

13:24.456 --> 13:27.958
until this mess blows over,
which might be never.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.012
Okay.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.558
Are you all right?

13:35.608 --> 13:37.912
Yeah. Yeah.
No, I'm fine. I just, um...

13:37.913 --> 13:41.473
- Any time you wanna talk, I'm--
I'm here to listen. - Thank you.

13:43.973 --> 13:45.311
Except now.

13:45.970 --> 13:46.925
Hey, mom.

13:46.926 --> 13:51.629
Hi. Listen, I didn't get it!
Luc came in, and I panicked,

13:51.630 --> 13:53.697
so you have
to go back over there.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.226
I can't. I'm busy.

13:56.227 --> 13:59.745
- Where are you?
- I'm at Kevin and Scotty's...

13:59.746 --> 14:02.134
- I'm not here. I'm not here.
- But they're not here.

14:02.135 --> 14:04.065
Well, then what are you doing?

14:04.646 --> 14:07.714
Um... my--my cable went out,

14:07.715 --> 14:09.843
- so I'm watching, uh, a hockey game.
- Wait a minute.

14:09.844 --> 14:10.861
You're too busy watching

14:10.862 --> 14:14.244
- a hockey game to help me?
- Well, it's tied.

14:14.324 --> 14:17.061
Justin, get your butt
over to your sister's.

14:17.062 --> 14:19.342
I have to go to work.
I will see you here

14:19.437 --> 14:21.096
later this afternoon, okay?

14:21.097 --> 14:23.289
Fine, mom. Fine.
I'll see you soon.

14:24.618 --> 14:26.565
I'm so sorry to make you
go through this charade.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.628
- Oh, no. It's, uh, it's okay.
- What does she want?

14:30.788 --> 14:34.131
She wanted me to go over
and watch this movie with her.

14:34.132 --> 14:38.070
- Wow. She really is lonely.
- So lonely.

14:39.770 --> 14:40.786
Hi.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.884
Why are you here?

14:42.885 --> 14:44.781
Well, I'm trying to talk to you,
like I was trying to talk to you

14:44.782 --> 14:47.397
when you left Sarah's house,
like I was trying to talk to you

14:47.398 --> 14:50.198
when I called you ten times
on the way over here.

14:50.879 --> 14:52.139
Maybe you should take a hint.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.234
- I'm busy.
- Nora, what happened back there?

14:54.235 --> 14:56.372
Luc said that it had something
to do with a hairbrush.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.410
Stop the presses. Nora Walker
was found holding a hairbrush.

14:59.411 --> 15:01.968
Saul, I am dealing with
the cesspool that is my life

15:01.969 --> 15:03.013
in my own little way,

15:03.014 --> 15:06.186
- and you all need to let me
do that, all right? - All right.

15:06.187 --> 15:09.937
- And if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go.
- Where are you going now?

15:09.938 --> 15:13.123
I do still have a job.
Please go back to rehearsal.

15:13.124 --> 15:15.187
I can't believe you left it
to come here.

15:15.188 --> 15:16.510
I don't know that I can do that now.

15:16.511 --> 15:19.539
I talked to Luc about a prenup,
and he took it personally.

15:19.540 --> 15:22.273
What?! Oh, Saul.

15:22.274 --> 15:25.606
Why would you do that? My God.
It's none of your business.

15:25.607 --> 15:28.325
I did it because
I wanted to protect Sarah.

15:28.326 --> 15:30.204
I did it because I wanted
to do what I thought

15:30.205 --> 15:34.572
- that William would do.
- Listen to me. You are not her father.

15:34.573 --> 15:38.089
What she needs from her family
is support. Help her have

15:38.090 --> 15:40.251
the very best wedding she can have.
Give her your song.

15:40.252 --> 15:42.828
That's what you can do.
You can give her your song.

15:48.356 --> 15:49.671
Hey.

15:50.653 --> 15:54.027
Jeremy's got the lunch rush
under control, thank God.

15:54.277 --> 15:57.414
I don't think I could force
a smile for another second. Ohh.

15:57.946 --> 15:59.510
I told Justin.

15:59.833 --> 16:03.158
- Did you make him swear not to tell
your family? - Yes, Scotty.

16:03.159 --> 16:05.931
I think he understands
the gravity of the situation.

16:06.268 --> 16:07.712
What'd he say?

16:10.820 --> 16:14.011
He said he thought she should be
in jail for 20 years, minimum.

16:14.012 --> 16:15.666
He also called her a monster.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.449
I don't believe that.
She's not an evil person.

16:19.536 --> 16:22.719
Kevin, neither of us knows
what it's like to carry a baby

16:22.720 --> 16:24.603
- inside our bodies.
- I'm--I'm sorry.

16:24.604 --> 16:27.353
I can't listen to this.
We have a son, Scotty.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.474
It says here "father unknown,"
which is a lie.

16:29.475 --> 16:31.192
It also says his name is Daniel,

16:31.267 --> 16:33.824
which is not the name we chose,
but Michelle's father's name.

16:33.825 --> 16:36.238
Our son doesn't know we exist.

16:37.499 --> 16:39.786
What more is it gonna take
until you are angry at her?

16:39.865 --> 16:44.808
I am angry, but it doesn't make me
feel better to hate her.

16:47.929 --> 16:49.167
I'm sorry.

16:49.449 --> 16:50.802
It's okay.

16:52.148 --> 16:54.384
Look, Kevin,
we've gotta pull it together

16:54.471 --> 16:56.153
before Olivia gets home.

16:56.885 --> 16:57.929
I know.

16:58.944 --> 17:00.071
I know.

17:02.704 --> 17:05.667
I forgot to tell you, she texted me
a couple of minutes ago.

17:07.150 --> 17:09.584
- Really? I didn't get one from her.
- Well, check your phone.

17:09.585 --> 17:11.338
I'm sure she's written
something to you, too.

17:11.339 --> 17:14.646
"Saw a baby deer"--
three exclamation points.

17:14.647 --> 17:18.413
"Paige 'n' I 'r' 'n' the same tent."

17:19.934 --> 17:21.050
I miss her.

17:21.050 --> 17:24.080
So do I.
Bet she's having a great time.

17:24.082 --> 17:25.161
Yeah.

17:26.209 --> 17:27.461
What did she say?

17:30.470 --> 17:32.773
Uh, it's-- it's not from her.

17:33.564 --> 17:35.526
It's, uh, Jeremy.
He needs me back downstairs.

17:35.527 --> 17:37.349
Well, don't worry.
I'm sure she's writing you a long text

17:37.350 --> 17:39.822
- about skunks or something.
- Yeah, I'll, um,

17:40.242 --> 17:42.670
I'll s-- I'll send her something
from downstairs.

17:57.942 --> 17:59.154
Kevin?

17:59.155 --> 18:01.583
- Where's Scotty?
- I don't know. What do you need?

18:01.584 --> 18:02.564
Nothing. I don't need anything.

18:02.565 --> 18:04.819
I just stopped by to gather up
some snacks to bring over there.

18:05.900 --> 18:09.387
- The rehearsal.
- Oh, my God.

18:09.826 --> 18:11.810
- You forgot?
- Yeah. Completely.

18:11.811 --> 18:13.319
Well, it's okay. Don't worry.
I'll wait for you.

18:13.412 --> 18:15.928
- Come on. - Uh, y--uh,
you know what? Saul, I'm so sorry.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.975
Um, Scotty and I--
we've got a lot going on right now.

18:18.976 --> 18:21.401
I don't-- I don't think we can do it.

18:21.505 --> 18:23.371
The rehearsal or the whole thing?

18:23.774 --> 18:25.349
I'm sorry.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.556
Both of you?

18:28.181 --> 18:31.087
Kevin, what is more important
than your sister?

18:31.258 --> 18:32.508
Saul, I don't know. Okay.

18:32.509 --> 18:35.503
You--you--you need to tell me
what is going on with you.

18:35.755 --> 18:39.405
- I... I'm just tired.
- And that's it?

18:39.406 --> 18:41.513
That's all you're gonna tell me,
that you're "just tired"?

18:41.604 --> 18:44.953
- But it's--it's the truth.
- I-- okay, I give up. I give up.

18:44.954 --> 18:46.505
Nora won't talk to me about Brody,
I try to help

18:46.506 --> 18:48.550
Luc and Sarah, and they
don't want to hear any of it,

18:48.551 --> 18:50.244
and you look like
the world is coming to an end,

18:50.245 --> 18:52.564
and you tell me that
all you need is a nap.

18:52.744 --> 18:54.175
- Okay.
- Saul, can you please--

18:54.176 --> 18:56.306
N-no. You know what?
You take care of your business.

18:56.307 --> 18:58.333
I'll take care of mine.

19:04.765 --> 19:07.110
Good. I'm glad you're here.

19:07.111 --> 19:08.045
You are?

19:08.046 --> 19:11.110
Yeah. You can help me
sort songs that Saul likes

19:11.111 --> 19:15.000
- a-and songs that are good.
- Right, because we have rehearsal.

19:15.001 --> 19:16.172
Yeah. I'm glad you're excited.

19:16.173 --> 19:19.422
Yeah, I'm very excited
about that. I just, uh...

19:19.899 --> 19:22.439
- Have to use the bathroom.
- Hey, use the one down here.

19:22.518 --> 19:23.310
No, I think I've really

19:23.311 --> 19:26.176
- gotta use the one upstairs.
- Ohh. Oh, I got it.

19:26.177 --> 19:27.909
- Take a bathroom trip.
- Oh, yeah.

19:27.910 --> 19:30.021
- Thank you for the consideration.
- Thank you.

19:32.392 --> 19:35.152
Okay.
Kevin and Scotty quit...

19:35.698 --> 19:36.376
What?

19:36.377 --> 19:37.779
You know what?
I don't want to talk about it.

19:37.780 --> 19:38.768
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

19:38.769 --> 19:41.075
Let's get on with it. Well, Justin
has an opinion about the song.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.866
- I'm so sorry, guys. I can't stay.
- Oh. - What?

19:46.285 --> 19:48.091
Guess it's gonna be
the two of us now.

19:48.092 --> 19:50.152
Yeah, looks like it's just us.

19:50.449 --> 19:51.575
Fine.

19:51.906 --> 19:55.059
- Let's just pick a song that doesn't suck.
- Okay.

19:55.989 --> 19:58.319
Come on.
It's gotta be in here some--

19:58.876 --> 20:01.219
Ah. Eureka!

20:01.220 --> 20:03.452
- Aah! Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

20:03.453 --> 20:05.992
Oh, God. Justin,
you scared the crap out of me.

20:05.993 --> 20:08.789
Uh, what are you doing?

20:08.790 --> 20:09.996
Nothin'.

20:11.799 --> 20:14.182
Is that mom's passport?

20:14.663 --> 20:16.752
Okay, listen, I'm taking mom

20:16.847 --> 20:19.206
on a surprise
3-day cruise to Mexico.

20:19.207 --> 20:21.046
That's why I have her luggage...

20:21.141 --> 20:23.006
and her swimsuit
and her sundresses

20:23.007 --> 20:25.689
and her sandals
and her sunglasses,

20:25.690 --> 20:28.327
- because we're leaving tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.469
Mm-hmm.
She needs to rest, Justin.

20:30.470 --> 20:33.735
She's gotta recuperate from
this whole Brody breakup thing.

20:33.736 --> 20:35.480
She's in denial about
how much pain she's in,

20:35.481 --> 20:37.468
and she's too stubborn
to ask for help,

20:37.469 --> 20:40.374
so breathe a word of this to anybody,
and I will disown you,

20:40.375 --> 20:43.664
- and you will no longer be my brother.
- Please don't say that.

20:43.665 --> 20:46.937
- Oh, my God. Would you look at this?
- What is that?

20:47.026 --> 20:49.161
Brody's baseball cap,

20:49.162 --> 20:52.273
hermetically sealed in a freezer bag.

20:52.274 --> 20:53.393
Um, yeah, she's--

20:53.394 --> 20:56.521
she's probably just keeping that
in case he wants it back.

20:56.522 --> 21:00.043
Oh, come on.
He must have, like, 50 of these.

21:00.224 --> 21:03.562
No, it's like she's preserving it
as a keepsake.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.991
Oh, Justin, this is creepy.

21:06.992 --> 21:09.745
- So creepy. - No, I'm seriously
worried. Before you know it,

21:09.746 --> 21:11.566
she'll be thumping around
in her wedding dress

21:11.567 --> 21:13.842
- like Miss Havisham.
- Can I see...

21:14.315 --> 21:15.644
Justin?

21:15.645 --> 21:17.594
- Where is it?
- Shh!

21:18.747 --> 21:20.738
W-- Hi, mom.

21:20.739 --> 21:21.827
Hi.

21:22.225 --> 21:24.459
- Sweetheart, what a surprise.
- Yeah.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.909
I just wanted to make sure
you were feeling better.

21:26.985 --> 21:29.390
Oh, I am. Thank you.

21:29.391 --> 21:31.635
Ohh. Ohh.
Feeling so much better.

21:32.778 --> 21:36.034
Oh, gosh, yes.
Just so much better.

21:36.035 --> 21:38.878
I-I really just--
I-I've put it all behind me.

21:38.879 --> 21:40.321
Practically forgotten.

21:40.322 --> 21:41.237
Mom, stop that.

21:41.238 --> 21:43.742
It's okay to let your anger out.
God knows, I'm angry, too.

21:43.743 --> 21:46.366
The way Brody treated you--
it was unforgivable.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.325
It was shameful.
He's--he's a coward.

21:48.402 --> 21:50.769
He's a spineless beast,
and it's okay to say so.

21:50.770 --> 21:53.087
Sweetheart, honestly,
could we just drop it?

21:53.161 --> 21:55.253
Yeah, he's not that bad.

21:55.345 --> 21:56.761
Drop it!

21:57.813 --> 22:01.077
Oh. Kevin-- anyone talk
to Kevin lately, huh?

22:01.166 --> 22:02.724
- Uh, no.
- No?

22:02.725 --> 22:04.672
Uh, no. Yeah.
Haven't seen Kevin either.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.735
Really? Oh, I...

22:07.736 --> 22:10.757
Uh, no. I thought it was just,
uh, me he was avoiding.

22:10.838 --> 22:13.689
- He hasn't even called you to see
how you're doing? - No, he hasn't,

22:13.690 --> 22:16.826
and I-I think that's so odd.
I-I really think you should go

22:16.827 --> 22:19.158
- right over there, Sarah, and--
and check on him. - No. No, I, uh...

22:19.159 --> 22:24.664
I completely forgot. I talked
to Saul and Luc, and he's fine.

22:24.665 --> 22:27.509
Wait a minute. What are
Saul and Luc doing talking to Kevin?

22:28.096 --> 22:29.893
Some legal thing.

22:29.894 --> 22:32.825
Oh, God. I can't believe this.
I bet he got Kevin involved

22:32.826 --> 22:33.659
to try to put pressure on

22:33.660 --> 22:36.056
- Luc to sign a prenup.
- You know about that?

22:36.130 --> 22:37.180
- Prenup?
- You know about that?

22:37.270 --> 22:40.223
- I'm so happy I don't know about that.
- Mom?

22:40.224 --> 22:43.380
You know, I have such
a load of paperwork to do.

22:43.381 --> 22:45.240
- I-if you'll ex--
- Mom! Mom!

22:45.241 --> 22:49.029
- What? - Uh... paprika. Do you have any?
Uh, I was halfway through

22:49.030 --> 22:51.312
making goulash,
realized I was completely out.

22:51.313 --> 22:54.450
- I love your goulash.
- It's goulash, people.

22:54.451 --> 22:56.655
What's your goulash without paprika?

22:57.841 --> 22:59.168
Yeah. Yeah.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.298
I-I'll-- I'll get you the paprika.

23:01.389 --> 23:03.567
Thanks, mom.
You're just such a lifesaver.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.150
Lifesaver.

23:05.895 --> 23:07.194
All right, listen,

23:07.195 --> 23:08.487
I gotta get all this stuff out of here.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.941
You know, you keep
an eye on her, okay?

23:09.942 --> 23:12.578
- I am really worried about her.
Don't leave her alone. - Okay. Okay.

23:17.567 --> 23:18.594
Where'd she go?

23:18.595 --> 23:20.940
W--uh, she--
something just came up.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.267
Oh, thank God.
I thought she'd never leave.

23:23.268 --> 23:24.611
Okay, mom. I, uh, I can't take

23:24.612 --> 23:27.392
- much more of this. I'm...
- Justin, you got it!

23:27.393 --> 23:28.928
- Yes, I got it, mom.
- You got it!

23:29.002 --> 23:32.439
You take the hair
and the hat and go.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.805
Do you think maybe you could

23:33.806 --> 23:36.710
- them to put a rush on it?
- Mom, you know what?

23:36.711 --> 23:38.603
Trust me.
I've done this before, all right?

23:38.604 --> 23:40.558
I'll have 'em put it on our tab.

23:54.393 --> 23:55.840
I'm so sorry, Scotty.

23:55.841 --> 23:59.529
- You didn't bring Daniel.
- How do you know his name?

23:59.946 --> 24:02.559
Please, Scotty, tell me that
you did not call the police.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.835
Michelle, did you honestly think

24:03.836 --> 24:06.638
- we wouldn't try to find you?
- That's why I called you.

24:07.163 --> 24:09.335
I know that what I did
was wrong, but I thought

24:09.336 --> 24:11.729
if you and I could talk,
we could figure out a solution

24:11.730 --> 24:14.253
without getting the police involved,
but, Scotty,

24:14.254 --> 24:18.096
I can't bring Daniel unless
I know that I can trust you.

24:19.227 --> 24:20.552
That's pretty presumptuous of you,

24:20.553 --> 24:22.632
lecturing me about trust.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.721
I'm so sorry, Scotty.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.421
Michelle, I-I believe that you're sorry,

24:39.422 --> 24:42.945
but... you have to let us see him.

24:42.946 --> 24:45.383
I can't. I'm afraid
you'll have me arrested.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.375
We won't. I promise.

24:47.457 --> 24:50.036
Scotty, I swear,
if you try to take him away,

24:50.037 --> 24:54.470
I will disappear again.
I am his mother, and he needs me.

24:54.540 --> 24:57.272
Okay, Michelle, don't run away, okay?
We can work something out.

24:57.273 --> 24:59.685
We care about
both you and Daniel,

25:01.683 --> 25:03.191
and we forgive you.

25:05.660 --> 25:07.512
You really think that
Kevin will understand?

25:07.513 --> 25:08.681
Of course.

25:09.829 --> 25:11.556
We want what's best for Daniel.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.064
That's what you want, isn't it?

25:15.585 --> 25:18.208
I don't have to keep looking
over my shoulder anymore?

25:20.032 --> 25:21.136
No.

25:21.619 --> 25:23.038
You're safe.

25:30.249 --> 25:33.892
â™ª Baby, I need your loving â™ª

25:34.124 --> 25:39.647
â™ª got to have all your loving â™ª

25:40.432 --> 25:41.727
- Okay.
- Beautiful.

25:41.728 --> 25:43.479
- I think we got a winner.
- We do.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.935
Oh, my God.
I can't wait to see her, like,

25:45.936 --> 25:48.255
doing the thing that she does,
like, crying and laughing

25:48.256 --> 25:50.566
- at the same time.
- Oh, I'm gonna love that!

25:50.567 --> 25:52.719
All right, so you
and Justin will do melody,

25:52.720 --> 25:54.554
and we'll be fine
without Scotty and Kevin,

25:54.555 --> 25:57.243
although Scotty's a big loss,
but Kevin is just a killjoy

25:57.244 --> 25:59.023
- with pitch problems.
- We can do without him.

25:59.024 --> 26:00.033
Okay.

26:03.969 --> 26:04.959
Okay.

26:08.233 --> 26:08.866
Hi.

26:08.867 --> 26:11.717
Hey, honey. What a surprise.

26:12.808 --> 26:16.088
Oh, don't you "what a surprise" me.

26:16.730 --> 26:18.552
I know exactly why you're here.

26:18.700 --> 26:22.335
- Oh, y-you do? - Yes, and I don't
appreciate you going behind my back

26:22.336 --> 26:24.615
to put pressure on Luc
about this whole prenup thing.

26:24.616 --> 26:25.828
- No means no, Saul.
- Oh, no,

26:25.829 --> 26:27.796
- No, no, no, no.
That's not--that's not it.

26:27.797 --> 26:30.508
My God. Is that the prenup?

26:30.509 --> 26:31.303
This is not what you think it is.

26:31.304 --> 26:32.575
Come on. Yeah,
you don't understand, Sarah. I--

26:32.576 --> 26:34.349
Listen, Luc, despite
what he might have said,

26:34.350 --> 26:35.746
- I do not want this.
- Okay.

26:35.747 --> 26:36.381
I don't want it either. It's just that--

26:36.382 --> 26:40.072
Good. Good. Did you hear that?
Neither of us want this.

26:40.086 --> 26:41.563
- Saul, you had no right...
- No, Sarah, stop it!

26:41.564 --> 26:43.772
...to bring this paperwork!

26:47.718 --> 26:50.277
We were trying to surprise you
with a song for the wedding.

26:51.489 --> 26:52.515
Oh, my God.

26:52.516 --> 26:57.376
That is so sweet,
and I feel really terrible.

26:57.377 --> 26:58.607
You told me
not to come home for lunch...

26:58.608 --> 27:00.192
and I totally forgot.

27:02.368 --> 27:03.988
- Saul, I really-- I'm sorry about--
- It's fine.

27:03.989 --> 27:05.383
Listen, you guys
have a lot of work to do,

27:05.384 --> 27:07.191
So y-you're right.
I'm--I'm just gonna go.

27:07.192 --> 27:07.911
- It's okay.
- I-I really--

27:07.912 --> 27:09.257
Sorry, Saul.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.271
Oh, uh, no.
There's no news.

27:15.272 --> 27:17.383
I just-- I could use
some company this morning.

27:17.384 --> 27:19.240
- That's all.
- Actually, bro, I'm so sorry.

27:19.241 --> 27:21.384
I can't. I'm running
this stupid errand for mom,

27:21.385 --> 27:23.723
and it's... it's kinda time-sensitive,

27:23.724 --> 27:25.517
but, look, I'm here
if you want to talk.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.019
- Oh, hang on. That's Scotty's phone.
- You need to get it?

27:28.020 --> 27:30.436
Yeah, it might be Olivia
calling from big bear.

27:30.444 --> 27:31.956
All right, listen,
we'll set something up for later.

27:31.957 --> 27:34.067
- I'll call you when I'm done with mom.
- Okay. Bye.

27:34.068 --> 27:34.815
Hello.

27:34.816 --> 27:36.256
Hi. It's Michelle.

27:38.723 --> 27:39.876
Scotty?

27:41.617 --> 27:43.263
Uh, no, this is Kevin.

27:46.257 --> 27:48.663
Um... Kevin, I-I'm sorry.

27:48.664 --> 27:50.966
I-I told, um, Scotty
I was gonna call him today.

27:50.967 --> 27:52.943
Well, Scotty isn't here right now,

27:52.944 --> 27:56.611
so, um, what did--
what did you want to talk about?

27:56.612 --> 27:57.636
Maybe I should call back.

27:57.637 --> 28:01.415
No. No, because whatever it is you--
you wanted to say,

28:01.416 --> 28:04.470
- you can say to me. Where are you?
- I-I can't tell you that.

28:04.471 --> 28:07.349
That is not part of the deal
that I made with Scotty.

28:08.681 --> 28:10.697
You made a deal with Scotty?

28:10.698 --> 28:13.964
- Would you like to tell me what that was?
- I thought he told you.

28:13.965 --> 28:16.764
No, he didn't, so why
don't you tell me, Michelle?

28:20.524 --> 28:24.012
Scotty and I decided
to do what's best for Daniel.

28:24.231 --> 28:26.425
I-I'm his mother,
so I need to stay involved.

28:26.426 --> 28:30.111
No, you're not, Michelle.
You're our son's gestational surrogate.

28:30.112 --> 28:32.048
You're not even genetically related...

28:32.061 --> 28:35.452
So there's no deal that
will allow you to keep our baby.

28:38.047 --> 28:40.230
Scotty swore to me
that you understood.

28:40.231 --> 28:42.904
No, what I understand is,
that is my baby crying,

28:42.905 --> 28:45.190
so why don't you tell me
where you are before you get

28:45.191 --> 28:46.690
into more trouble
than you're already in,

28:46.691 --> 28:47.844
- Michelle?!
- Kevin, don't.

28:47.845 --> 28:50.071
- No. Scotty! Scotty! Scotty!
- Michelle? Michelle? Michelle? Mich--

28:53.249 --> 28:55.012
- What is wrong with you?
- I was setting up a meeting.

28:55.013 --> 28:56.884
I was going to get him back.

28:56.885 --> 28:59.570
Apparently you've already had
a meeting!

28:59.571 --> 29:02.440
Why didn't you tell me
you were negotiating with her?!

29:02.441 --> 29:03.615
Because she called me!

29:03.616 --> 29:07.495
Scotty, he is my son, too!
Why didn't you tell me?!

29:07.496 --> 29:09.687
Because I knew you would screw it up,
like you just did!

29:09.688 --> 29:11.675
I thought if I showed her
a little understanding,

29:11.676 --> 29:14.899
she would bring him back safely.
Now we may never find him!

29:14.900 --> 29:18.437
You are absolutely right!
Absolutely!

29:19.092 --> 29:21.285
So good luck living with that!

29:29.003 --> 29:30.715
Are you sure you want to open that?

29:31.136 --> 29:32.208
Yes.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.165
I want to get it over with.

29:46.180 --> 29:47.380
Oh, no.

29:49.125 --> 29:50.484
Positive.

29:53.548 --> 29:55.148
Oh, my God.

29:56.571 --> 29:58.209
Oh, my God.

30:01.797 --> 30:02.467
Wait. Wh-wh--
what are you gonna do?

30:02.468 --> 30:04.580
I mean, how--
how do you even handle this?

30:04.651 --> 30:07.699
I don't know.
Is there ever a good time

30:07.700 --> 30:09.636
to tell your daughter
something like this?

30:10.013 --> 30:12.615
But certainly it's not now,
not right before her wedding.

30:12.616 --> 30:14.358
What--what the hell
are you talking about, mom?

30:14.359 --> 30:16.107
You can't keep
something like this from Sarah.

30:16.108 --> 30:17.634
Yes, I can. Justin. I can.

30:17.635 --> 30:18.687
Well, count me out.

30:18.688 --> 30:20.067
Count me out, mom.
I've told you this before.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.971
There is no way
you can expect me to lie

30:21.972 --> 30:23.833
- to Sarah's face like this.
- Justin, please.

30:23.834 --> 30:27.263
Don't go all wobbly on me now.

30:27.264 --> 30:28.398
This is not exactly

30:28.399 --> 30:30.614
an easy piece of information
for me to digest,

30:30.615 --> 30:32.949
so if I can, you can.
I mean, what am I gonna say

30:32.950 --> 30:35.062
- to Sarah, "guess what, honey? Surprise!"
- Surprise?

30:35.063 --> 30:36.842
You want a surprise, mom?
Sarah's about to take you

30:36.843 --> 30:39.804
on a Mexican cruise so you can
spend 24 hours a day talking

30:39.805 --> 30:42.540
about how much nasty
old Brody broke your heart.

30:42.744 --> 30:44.887
- What? - Yeah, so how are you
gonna look Sarah in the face

30:44.888 --> 30:46.982
for three days, mom,
and not tell her the truth?

30:46.983 --> 30:48.332
When did you know about this cruise?

30:48.333 --> 30:49.923
Mom, it doesn't matter
when I knew about this!

30:49.924 --> 30:50.503
You should have told me.
You don't tell me anything!

30:50.504 --> 30:52.269
Mom, you're missing
the whole point of this!

30:55.296 --> 30:57.017
Sorry, mom.
I didn't know you were here.

30:59.367 --> 31:01.253
Kevin, are you all right?
What's wrong?

31:02.521 --> 31:03.576
I'm fine.

31:05.052 --> 31:06.140
Justin.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.120
What, mom?
I didn't tell him anything!

31:13.121 --> 31:14.463
- Shh!
- I haven't told anybody any-- you know,

31:14.464 --> 31:15.423
listen, I'm sick of this!

31:15.424 --> 31:17.200
Kevin, you need
to tell mom what's going on.

31:17.201 --> 31:19.316
Mom, you need
to tell Kevin about Sarah.

31:19.317 --> 31:21.367
Everybody in this family
needs to start telling

31:21.368 --> 31:23.053
- each other the truth!
- Not now!

31:23.054 --> 31:25.047
Yes, mom, now!
Right now!

31:25.048 --> 31:29.531
Kevin, mom and I did a D.N.A. test
behind Sarah's back,

31:29.532 --> 31:31.735
and mom doesn't want to tell her
that Brody's her father.

31:31.736 --> 31:35.042
And, mom, Michelle lied.
She did not have a miscarriage.

31:35.043 --> 31:37.392
- Kevin has a son, and you have a grandson.
- Shh--

31:37.393 --> 31:40.412
Nobody knows where he is.
People need to talk!

31:40.413 --> 31:41.931
Why don't you two start?

31:51.111 --> 31:54.171
Remind me to never
get really emotional news

31:54.172 --> 31:57.391
- at Justin's house ever again.
- Yeah, the strongest thing

31:57.392 --> 31:59.681
he's got back there
is white wine vinegar.

32:01.032 --> 32:03.064
- Wanna try a little of that?
- Sure. I'm in.

32:05.292 --> 32:06.396
Poor Sarah.

32:06.397 --> 32:08.109
Poor you. Poor Scotty.

32:08.569 --> 32:11.192
Sarah gained a father.
We lost a son.

32:12.977 --> 32:14.791
Don't say that.
There's always hope.

32:14.792 --> 32:17.009
Oh, mom, I've been through this.

32:17.592 --> 32:18.952
I'm scared to hope.

32:20.296 --> 32:21.689
Well, then I'll hope for you.

32:24.504 --> 32:26.713
At least there's one
bright spot in all this.

32:27.037 --> 32:28.129
What?

32:28.130 --> 32:30.240
Well, it seems Brody
really does love you.

32:32.057 --> 32:35.823
Yeah, like I could
take any great pleasure

32:35.824 --> 32:36.923
in that right now.

32:36.924 --> 32:39.964
Why not? Maybe you could
pick up where you left off.

32:42.236 --> 32:44.012
I don't even know what to think.

32:44.776 --> 32:46.243
But you are gonna contact him

32:46.244 --> 32:48.901
and tell him about Sarah, aren't you?

32:50.316 --> 32:51.467
I don't know.

32:56.343 --> 32:58.479
Mom, I've just spent
the last three nights

32:58.480 --> 33:00.579
lying awake agonizing over the fact

33:00.580 --> 33:03.268
that my son might
never know who I am

33:03.420 --> 33:05.052
or that I'm his father.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.847
Maybe Brody feels the same way.

33:14.028 --> 33:15.567
Come on. Don't worry.
He'll be home soon.

33:15.568 --> 33:17.329
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm sure you're right.

33:20.129 --> 33:22.358
Was he yelling when you saw him?
I know he's in good shape,

33:22.359 --> 33:24.352
but I-I worry about
his blood pressure.

33:24.353 --> 33:28.273
- He was not yelling. He did look sad...
- Oh.

33:28.466 --> 33:32.199
And so do you, so, Scotty,
this is your lucky day,

33:32.200 --> 33:35.215
because I just off-loaded
most of my worry quota,

33:35.216 --> 33:37.574
so I'm 100% available to listen.

33:42.367 --> 33:45.340
Okay, this is the second time
we've lost this baby.

33:45.847 --> 33:48.362
And he's our son.
We can't give up on him,

33:49.008 --> 33:50.319
but we can't--

33:50.320 --> 33:52.815
we can't keep putting
ourselves through this.

33:54.955 --> 33:56.349
Honey, I'm home.

33:56.463 --> 33:58.594
Where did you learn that?
Ohh!

33:58.595 --> 34:01.509
I have been waiting for you all day.

34:01.751 --> 34:04.168
- Hi, Uncle Justin.
- What's up, dudette? Ohh.

34:04.558 --> 34:06.732
Come here. I want to hear
all about your trip.

34:08.228 --> 34:09.428
What do you got there?

34:09.496 --> 34:12.504
Paige said if you give someone
a rock from wherever you go

34:12.940 --> 34:14.972
that it's kinda like the person
was there with you.

34:16.344 --> 34:18.322
That is so sweet.
Thank you. Mwah.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.956
Let's go give Kevin his.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.580
Uh, he's not home, honey.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.074
Um, let me see that.

34:25.076 --> 34:27.690
This is, uh, this is the one
you're gonna give Kevin?

34:27.690 --> 34:29.286
- Yeah.
- Well, this is perfect. You know why?

34:29.288 --> 34:32.295
- Why? - Because this looks
just like the shape of his head.

34:32.888 --> 34:34.393
Shh. Don't tell him.

34:40.364 --> 34:42.206
- Mom!
- I'm in here, sweetheart!

34:42.208 --> 34:43.569
Ah.

34:45.924 --> 34:47.460
Now don't be mad,

34:47.927 --> 34:50.280
but I have
a little surprise for you.

34:51.098 --> 34:52.063
- No, I--
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:52.063 --> 34:55.574
- Don't say no. You don't even
know what it is yet. - Sarah.

34:55.574 --> 34:59.661
- What? Oh, the flower's too much?
I know. I'm an idiot. - I know.

34:59.872 --> 35:01.361
What, that I'm an idiot?

35:01.497 --> 35:04.904
No.
No, I know about the cruise.

35:05.123 --> 35:09.208
Ohh! Justin!
I am going to wring his little neck.

35:09.209 --> 35:10.455
We're not gonna go to Mexico.

35:10.456 --> 35:13.441
No, wait, mom.
Mom, hear me out.

35:13.442 --> 35:17.328
It'll be three amazing days
of quality girl time.

35:17.340 --> 35:19.448
We'll-- we'll just--
we can relax in the sun,

35:19.449 --> 35:22.351
talk trash about everybody else
on the boat. We can laugh.

35:22.352 --> 35:25.228
We can cry. We can share.
Come on. We need this.

35:25.229 --> 35:26.975
- We c-- we can drink!
- I'm not gonna

35:26.976 --> 35:28.687
go away with you two weeks
before your wedding.

35:28.688 --> 35:33.263
Mom, it's handled. Honestly,
I want to go. I want to do this.

35:33.264 --> 35:35.344
- I don't.
- Why not?

35:36.309 --> 35:38.231
Come on, mom.
This is you and me.

35:38.232 --> 35:40.580
There's no excuses, not with us.
Come on.

35:40.581 --> 35:41.988
Look me in the eye,

35:42.073 --> 35:45.161
put a smile on your face,
and tell me you'll go.

35:47.024 --> 35:49.057
You're right.
No excuses, not ever.

35:49.801 --> 35:51.976
I don't want anything
to come between us.

35:53.128 --> 35:55.179
I just always wanted
to protect you,

35:55.180 --> 35:56.460
but I can't.

35:56.952 --> 35:58.102
What are you talking about?

36:01.929 --> 36:03.829
I need to tell you something.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.936
What? Mom, you're--
you're really scaring me.

36:08.832 --> 36:10.519
Could you sit down, please?

36:33.520 --> 36:36.746
You've gotta love a family whose
response to a paternity crisis

36:36.747 --> 36:38.555
- and a kidnapping is food and wine.
- Thank you.

36:38.556 --> 36:41.742
- Well, we have to keep our strength up.
- Yes, and your chicken

36:41.743 --> 36:44.866
is the ultimate comfort food, honey.

36:44.867 --> 36:46.439
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, well, I think maybe this time

36:46.440 --> 36:49.657
- we're asking too much of this
poor little chicken. - No. Never.

36:50.047 --> 36:51.408
Scotty sends his love.

36:51.605 --> 36:53.648
- Ohh.
- Are you guys okay?

36:54.244 --> 36:56.547
Yeah, we'll get there,
but, uh, more importantly,

36:56.625 --> 36:59.089
Olivia's back from big bear,
so I think I'm gonna take off.

36:59.090 --> 37:01.267
I want you to take
some of these cookies to her.

37:01.270 --> 37:02.983
Oh. Should we call Justin and
ask him if he wants to have dinner?

37:02.984 --> 37:05.048
- Yeah. - No, I think
we should just leave him alone.

37:05.049 --> 37:07.192
I think he's had quite enough family

37:07.219 --> 37:09.707
- fun for the time being.
- Good. More chicken for me.

37:09.708 --> 37:11.072
Oh, I can't believe that you still

37:11.073 --> 37:13.439
- have an appetite.
- I know. Dad always used to say

37:13.440 --> 37:15.714
that he and I could just
eat our way through anything.

37:20.457 --> 37:22.680
Oh, come on.
Please don't go weird on me.

37:22.919 --> 37:26.083
I'm still gonna talk about dad.
Nothing's changed.

37:26.084 --> 37:29.701
It's-- it's just some new information
on a piece of paper.

37:30.068 --> 37:32.651
It's like when mom made
the gravy from the cornstarch

37:32.652 --> 37:34.539
instead of the flour.
The ingredients change,

37:34.540 --> 37:37.176
but it's still gravy, okay?
You're still my family.

37:37.337 --> 37:38.739
Luc and I are still getting married.

37:38.740 --> 37:42.067
William is still my father,
and Brody is still some guy

37:42.068 --> 37:43.541
I knew for a while.

37:46.913 --> 37:49.136
So you don't want to explore
your relationship with him?

37:51.029 --> 37:54.411
No. No.
I-I had a dad.

37:54.412 --> 37:57.791
I had a great dad,
and if I ever need another one,

37:57.792 --> 37:59.463
I've got a pretty good
stand-in right here.

37:59.464 --> 38:01.738
Really? Even though I sometimes
overstep my boundaries?

38:01.739 --> 38:05.932
- Oh, come on. I love that
you worry about me. - Thanks, angel.

38:06.436 --> 38:07.924
The way I see it,

38:08.387 --> 38:10.677
Brody lied to mom
the day I was born.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.138
He made it crystal clear
that he didn't want either of us

38:13.139 --> 38:14.705
in his life-- not then and not now.

38:14.706 --> 38:18.065
And you know what, Brody?
The feeling is mutual.

38:32.607 --> 38:33.840
What are you doing?

38:33.889 --> 38:35.872
Uh, I'm trying to find this magazine.

38:35.873 --> 38:37.616
I wanted to give it to Sarah.

38:37.789 --> 38:41.832
Well, you can find it later,
because she and Luc just left.

38:41.833 --> 38:43.911
What? No, I wanted them
to take the leftovers.

38:43.912 --> 38:46.175
- Well, I threw out the leftovers.
- Why?

38:46.176 --> 38:47.443
Because there was no chicken left,

38:47.444 --> 38:50.341
and nobody would want to eat
your gravy after tonight.

38:50.744 --> 38:53.704
I didn't make any gravy.
Don't be cute.

38:54.148 --> 38:57.396
Nora, stop with the magazines, honey.

39:02.023 --> 39:03.671
Nora, talk to me.

39:18.092 --> 39:19.277
Saul...

39:20.633 --> 39:23.064
Brody and I
have a child together.

39:25.009 --> 39:26.865
Sarah is our daughter.

39:28.516 --> 39:30.945
Part of me
would like to call him up

39:30.946 --> 39:32.192
and...

39:34.722 --> 39:36.048
tell him.

39:36.944 --> 39:38.641
All right. Then why don't you?

39:40.077 --> 39:41.628
I can't.

39:43.485 --> 39:45.740
It doesn't matter
how much this affects me.

39:45.853 --> 39:47.116
It's Sarah.

39:48.373 --> 39:50.548
Her whole identity has shifted.

39:51.684 --> 39:52.951
The comfort she once had

39:52.952 --> 39:55.479
in "this is who I am,
this is where I come from"

39:56.675 --> 39:59.572
has... suddenly changed.

40:01.828 --> 40:03.227
I have to do whatever she wants,

40:03.228 --> 40:04.604
no matter what.

40:06.606 --> 40:07.128
Listen to me.

40:07.129 --> 40:09.351
I understand
everything you're saying,

40:09.972 --> 40:12.111
but you're leaving out
something very important.

40:13.895 --> 40:15.244
You're still in love with him.

40:20.745 --> 40:22.399
How can that possibly matter?

40:28.672 --> 40:31.047
Wow. Another masterpiece.

40:31.048 --> 40:33.828
Now it'll be like I'm sleeping
by the campfire, but in my bed.

40:33.829 --> 40:36.390
Okay, well, it is bedtime,
little camper.

40:37.681 --> 40:38.498
- Kevin!
- Aah!

40:38.499 --> 40:41.539
- You missed me so much.
- I know I did! Mwah.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.145
Oh. I got you this rock.
I know it doesn't sound

40:45.146 --> 40:48.119
like a good present, but really it is.

40:48.120 --> 40:51.191
I will love this forever
and call it Herman.

40:51.192 --> 40:55.003
Herman? That's a weird name.
Oh, you know what else is weird?

40:55.004 --> 40:58.271
- What? - Sometimes when the wind
would blow the campfire smoke

40:58.272 --> 40:59.527
where we were sitting...

40:59.528 --> 41:00.479
- Yeah.
- Cooper said if you

41:00.480 --> 41:02.328
close your eyes and say, "I love rabbits.

41:02.329 --> 41:05.128
I love rabbits," then the smoke
would blow the other way.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.431
I didn't believe it, but it worked.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.081
- What?!
- That's crazy.

41:09.108 --> 41:11.428
Ooh. Speaking of crazy,
it's your Uncle Justin.

41:11.475 --> 41:12.868
He said your head looks like a rock.

41:12.869 --> 41:14.961
Did you say
my head looks like a rock?

41:16.922 --> 41:18.297
You're where?

41:19.204 --> 41:21.284
Can I draw one more picture

41:21.430 --> 41:24.327
All right. Just tell me.
What did mom say now?

41:26.901 --> 41:27.622

41:27.623 --> 41:29.288
and put him in my arms and left.

41:32.369 --> 41:33.584
Oh, my God.

41:36.442 --> 41:37.565
Kevin?

41:38.060 --> 41:39.918
She just left him with Justin.

41:43.856 --> 41:51.164
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh. Oh.

41:51.585 --> 41:52.831
Guys.

41:54.613 --> 41:55.892
Whose baby is that?
