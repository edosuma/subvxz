00:00.600 --> 00:04.200
I'm hank. I was your typical emergency room doctor...

00:04.700 --> 00:05.700
Until i got fired.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.200
You let a billionaire hospital trustee die To save some kid off the street.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.900
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
This is my brother.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.600
I'm evan r. Lawson,cpa.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.800
He took me away from my troubles and to the hamptons,

00:17.700 --> 00:20.800
And suddenly,i had a chance To become a whole new kind of doctor.

00:21.100 --> 00:25.400
It turns out the wealthy and not-So-Wealthy  out here Could use a guy who makes house calls,

00:25.900 --> 00:28.900
So i got a second chance  to do what i do best.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.200
Come on.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.200
I know you can run faster.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.900
Come on! Just run slower.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.000
That's not the point of exercise.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.500
It's the point of brotherhood,man.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.600
Your guilt trips don't work on me.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.500
You slowed down,didn't you?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.400
-Yeah,just to say you--
-Forget it.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.000
Yeah. Okay,hold on a second.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.000
Wait. Let's talk.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.000
About what?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.100
Strategic planning for hankmed.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.100
What's the plan?

01:07.200 --> 01:10.100
People get sick or hurt,I treat them,you bill them.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.600
Yeah,this isn't the e.R.,though,Where people just come to you.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.900
This is concierge medicine.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.100
It requires guerilla marketing.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.000
Oh,really?I skipped that class in med school.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.700
Okay,let's start with the basics then.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.000
The affluent are a very elusive demo.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.500
Well,they won't be eluding us Because we won't be chasing them.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.100
Of course not. That would be crass.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.100
Hence my strategic plan.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.800
Okay,your strategic plan. Let's hear it.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.500
So i read in the new england journal of medicine

01:34.600 --> 01:37.500
That one in ten women between the ages of 21 and 40

01:37.700 --> 01:40.700
Ignores a medical condition  Just to avoid going to the doctor.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.300
You read the new england journal of medicine?

01:42.500 --> 01:43.200
Yeah,who doesn't?

01:44.500 --> 01:47.000
So today,we are gonna meet ten women.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.200
They're gonna ask us what we do for a living.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.100
We're gonna tell them and  we're gonna be so charming about it

01:51.200 --> 01:53.700
that at least one of them Is gonna be interested in your services.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.700
And the other nine?

01:55.500 --> 01:56.400
They'll be interested in mine.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.900
-You know what? -Okay,here we go.

02:00.600 --> 02:01.500
I'm gonna illustrate it for you.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.400
-See this guy with the dogs over there? -Yeah.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.600
-Pretend those dogs are attractive women,okay? -Okay.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.900
You start by zeroing in on just one of them.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.300
Hey,hey--Whoa!

02:13.600 --> 02:15.300
-Ow! -Chester,that's no!

02:15.400 --> 02:16.800
Little bit late on the dog whispering,pal.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.800
No biting.That's bad.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.400
Hey,can i have a look? I'm a doctor.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.100
-Let's get rid of that.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.500
Does any of this hurt?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.600
Not considering a dog just bit me.

02:26.700 --> 02:27.300
Right.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.600
Uh,here,get me something sharp And a towel.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.000
Okay.I'm sorry--Sorry.

02:32.700 --> 02:33.400
Let me see.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.500
All right,pull this finger back towards your nose.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.600
Extensors are fine. Okay.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.200
Good capillary refill.

02:39.300 --> 02:40.700
You know,it really doesn't even hurt that bad.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800
It's amazing what you can do With the words "medical emergency."

02:43.200 --> 02:44.100
Let me see your hand,please.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.900
Ah! Ah!

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500

Wow,thanks,man.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.700

02:56.800 --> 02:57.500
No,no,no. Please,please.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.300
Don't worry about it.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.000
Look,puncture wounds can get infected badly.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.400
You need to go to the hospital for a thorough cleaning.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.200
Man,i got a lot of work to do today. I ca--

03:04.300 --> 03:05.200

-Come on,guys.

03:10.700 --> 03:11.400

03:11.500 --> 03:13.400
We also do cat scratches and bee stings too.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.600
Oh.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.800
That was amazing.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.700
Well,that was exhausting.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.800
You're never going jogging with me again.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.100
Whoa! Bambi in the hamptons,that's kind of freaky.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.000
Yeah,you're right. I am never going jogging with you again.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.000
- Hey,boris. - Hank!

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
How are the accommodations?

03:41.100 --> 03:42.800
-Excessive. - Perfect.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.100
That's exactly how i feel.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.500
Hi,i don't think we've actually properly been introduced.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.600
I'm evan r. Lawson. I'm the cfo of hankmed.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.000
I'm quite aware of you,mr. Lawson.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.300
Cool. I just wanted to thank you for your hospitality.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.500
Uh,but my brother,uh,he's not being too  business savvy,If you know what i mean.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.500
Doesn't really understand that nothing in life is free.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.000
So i'd be happy to negotiate any  terms that you may have directly,

04:03.300 --> 04:04.100
Just you and me.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.000
I understand your new practice  out  here is thriving already.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.800
-How did you-- Never mind.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.300
There are two kinds of people here In the hamptons,hank--

04:15.200 --> 04:20.000
Those here to seek attention And those here trying to escape it.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.100
I just want you to know That  i strongly favor the latter.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.700
Yeah. Believe me,I have no interest in becoming a celebrity.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.500
-Tell me about them.
- Who?

04:28.900 --> 04:30.500
The boy with the damaged car.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.000
The woman with the...flat tire.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.000
Sorry.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.000
Confidentiality.

04:39.300 --> 04:43.000
I'm heading out for some relaxation time On my ocean boat,but i'll be back tomorrow.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.000
We'll catch up then?

04:45.300 --> 04:46.400
Make yourselves comfortable.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.300
You're guests here,Not renters.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.700
After all,the best things in life are free.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.500
man crush.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.700
You're seduced by anyone with an entourage.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.400
See you later. Bye.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.900
Wait,i'm not done talking.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.800
- I know. That's why i'm going.
-Can i shower?

05:12.900 --> 05:15.300
Uh,only if being clean's more important than being employed.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.600
Sorry,ev,no guerilla marketing.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.400
Okay,okay.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.300

05:20.000 --> 05:21.900
You gonna sit around all day waiting for you phone to--

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Okay,for the record,i made that happen.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.200
Uh,okay,okay.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.400
Answer the phone exactly like this: "hankmed. Good morning.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.200
I hope i didn't pull you away from something important.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.600
You know,i work for you now,hank,

06:13.700 --> 06:15.600
And this is what's important.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.500
Divya,look.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.600
You're clearly qualified To work at  any big physician group in manhattan.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.300
What's the deal here,honestly?

06:22.500 --> 06:25.400
Honestly,my parents insist That  i summer with them in the hamptons.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.600
So they don't support your career?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.300
It's not what they see for me.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.600
So i have to pursue it Very quietly.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.200
They don't know about your career.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.200
Sometimes you've got to take  things into your own hands,hank.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.400
Okay,okay.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.100
So what did the senator say exactly?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.500
He said it was urgent and refused  to give me Any details by phone.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.300
Maybe it's his heart again.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.200
Well,a failed run at the white  house Could take its toll on anyone.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.600
Selling 100 billion multivitamins May not buy you the presidency,

06:57.800 --> 07:00.600
But it will let you live like a king.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.200
Lucy everett.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.300
Hank lawson.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.500
Your reputation precedes you.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.200
Heh,along with my phone number.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.600
My husband heard some very good things.

07:17.000 --> 07:17.900
This is divya.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.300
I'm his physician assistant.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.300
Hmm.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.600
So where is the senator?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.800
In london. Follow me.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.200
As you may know,my son,kendrick,

07:31.300 --> 07:33.500
Just announced his commitment to notre dame.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.700
He will be competing to be the starting quarterback

07:37.300 --> 07:39.900
And they need him in perfect condition,

07:40.400 --> 07:45.600
Because usc's defensive line Hits a lot  harder than my daughter and nephews.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.900
Look,as much as i admire the fact That you have your own football field,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.600
Sports medicine isn't my area.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.500
This isn't about sports medicine.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.300
It's about a communications strategy.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.600
That's definitely not my area.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.100
His team physical is next week.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
I would like to avoid any surprises.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.800
At least any in public view.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.800
All right,so he needs a routine checkup.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.500
It's anything but routine.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.000
Without a clean bill of health,he will not be cleared for play.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.000
He needs an executive physical.

08:13.100 --> 08:17.500
Yes,your top-Of-The-Line executive physical.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.200
Check him from head to toe in painstaking detail.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.400
Yeah,we're not equipped for that.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.600
We'd need a cardiopulmonary stress-Testing machine,A 12-Lead e.C.G.--

08:27.500 --> 08:28.400
Here we are.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.200
Who's your interior designer,sanjay gupta?

08:34.299 --> 08:36.400
This is brand-New hospital-Grade equipment.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.100
Yes.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.500
Anything worth going out for these days Is something you can just as easily bring in.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.500
And i don't cut corners when it comes to my family.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.300
Sometimes you got to take things Into your own hands,right?

08:54.900 --> 08:56.800
He's a concierge doctor.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.600
He'll check our vitals,then book us dinner and a show?

08:59.900 --> 09:02.300
It means he will respect our privacy.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.500
Did dr. Greenwald tap our phones?

09:06.000 --> 09:06.900
Is this guy any good?

09:07.300 --> 09:08.800
He's recommended by dad's friend.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.100
- Who?
- No one you know.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.400
How do you know who i know?

09:11.500 --> 09:13.500
Melody,i have to focus on your brother now.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.100
We'll do this later. Is that okay?

09:15.600 --> 09:16.700
I got to take care of this thing.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.500
Catch you later,dude.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.800

09:19.900 --> 09:24.200

09:37.200 --> 09:39.000
Well,the exam takes as long as it takes.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.300
Kendrick has his nutritionist at 12:00

09:41.400 --> 09:44.200
And his private offensive coordinator at 1:30.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.900
My mandarin tutor at 3:00 and my life coach at 5:00.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.800
And i still don't even know what a life coach is.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.500
The point is,the exam needs to be as long as planned.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.800
In case you were wondering,

09:58.900 --> 10:00.700
Bathroom breaks are on alternate wednesdays.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.500
And once the argentinean girls were done eating out of my hand,

10:54.600 --> 10:55.700
Three cougars showed up,

10:55.800 --> 10:59.700
and i lured them By talking up the water's medically proven Rejuvenation properties.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.700
They completely ate it up.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.300
It was some of my best work,actually.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.800
A shame the cougars didn't eat you.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
You're disgracing our profession.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.100
I'll be back.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.400
I'm going to go change.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.200
Every time she hurts my feelings,It makes her hotter to me.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.000
Is that weird?

11:13.100 --> 11:13.900
- You're weird.
- Okay.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.800
So,yes,i am kicking ass and taking names out there,Like literally.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.400
The names are finding us just fine.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.800
-Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.000
And p.S.,we have to leverage that  momentum Before the well runs dry,okay?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.200
So i got this girl at us weekly--

11:26.300 --> 11:28.900
- Don't even think about it.
- Just one blurb on tmz.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Come on,hankmed treating the senator's son?

11:31.100 --> 11:32.300
That would be killer publicity for us.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.100
Their privacy is our publicity.

11:37.200 --> 11:37.800
Hello?

11:39.100 --> 11:40.100
Hey,what's wrong?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.000
Okay,i should see you right away,then.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.900
Uh,meet me behind pinch on the pier.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.000
Okay.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.500
Who was that? Was that a kennedy?A rockefeller?

11:47.600 --> 11:49.100
A jonas brother?
- No,it's benny.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.200
Who the hell is benny?

11:50.300 --> 11:53.200
The guy who got bit when you tried  to simulate flirtation On his pack of dogs.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.300
Oh,my god,that--

11:54.400 --> 11:55.400
Are we billing him this time?

11:55.500 --> 11:56.600
I have a hunch he can't afford us.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.700
Look,we treat who needs treatment.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.900
If they can afford to pay,great.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.100
If not,you'll figure out a way to make it all add up.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.200
All right,as long as cujo's not there,i'm good.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.200
You clean up nice.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.100
I just got a call.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.900
Uh,you want to squeeze in a quick one before we go?

12:11.100 --> 12:11.800
Oh,yes.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.300
He just took the words right out of my mouth.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.000
You're not worth the dry cleaning,evan.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.400
Let's go.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.300
Hotter and hotter still.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.400
You know,all dog walkers get bit at some point.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.300
It just comes with the territory.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.600
Please stop barking,beyonce!

12:30.100 --> 12:31.200
Gauze and a clamp.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.700
You said you'd go to the hospital.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.800
The wait there is four hours if--Ah--

12:36.900 --> 12:37.500
I'm lucky.

12:37.900 --> 12:42.100
Four hours times four dogs Times  ten bucks an hour is real money.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.800
And i'm not gonna ask my mom to help me with rent again.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.300
It's infected badly.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.300
Ah! Ah.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.200
Okay,look,we can start draining the abscess,

12:50.300 --> 12:52.000
But the hospital needs to finish the treatment.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.100
Why can't we just do it all here?

12:53.200 --> 12:56.800
No,it needs to be debrided by a hand surgeon Who knows where the nerves,arteries,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
And tendons are hiding.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.800
Well,i lost my insurance last year.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.600
Look,it's the e.R. Of a public hospital.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.500
They have to treat you.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.500
Well,i can't just tell them that.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.800
You can,and i'll show you how.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.500
Evan,keys.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.600
What?What are you doing?

13:11.700 --> 13:14.100
- Promoting you. Cfo and head dogsitter.

13:14.200 --> 13:14.800
Come on,benny.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.700
Those two live three blocks down on the left,94 cardinal drive.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.200
And the other guys are at 17 spring street,

13:21.300 --> 13:22.000
Right behind the movie theater.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.500
Okay,just make sure you get everyone home safely.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.300
-All right? - Hank,i can give you a ride.

13:26.700 --> 13:27.700
I got this one,divya.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.900
You look like you have somewhere to be.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I have a family obligation,but i can--

13:32.100 --> 13:33.900
Go.Enjoy it...if you can.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.500
Walk slow because kiki can't walk fast,all right?

13:41.300 --> 13:42.000
Here we go.

13:42.100 --> 13:42.700
Come on.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.900
So,divya,we can ride with you,right?

13:46.100 --> 13:46.700
sorry.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.800
Furry animals and sterile medical equipment don't mix.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.900
Hey,cute dogs.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.300
I hate this place.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.100
Just say exactly what we rehearsed.

14:14.200 --> 14:14.800
You're gonna be fine.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.700
Uh,i got bit by a dog.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.200
It's swollen,and it hurts bad.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.400
Fill these out and take a seat.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.800
But it's an emergency.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.700
Perfect.This is an emergency room.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.600
He has an ascending infection of the hand,

14:32.700 --> 14:35.900
Into the arm,presenting like a sclerosing tenosynovitis.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.100
-What did you do? - He just told you.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.900
-A dog bit him. - And you are?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Someone qualified to judge That he needs treatment immediately.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.700
Give me the charge nurse right away.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.600
Yeah,so i'll see you tomorrow,then?

14:55.400 --> 14:56.900
Cool. Okay.

14:57.000 --> 14:57.700
I'll see you later.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.400
come on.

15:01.000 --> 15:01.700
Come on,guys.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.900
Wow,that box looks heavy.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.100
Hey,don't i know you?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.600
They just don't make pickup lines like they used to.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.300
I have been labeled a progressive.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.200
I have to get to work.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.300
- Cute dogs.
- I know you.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.100
Hey. No,i'm serious. I really know you.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.400
Stephan,leave beyonce alone. Come here,come here.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.100
Jackie,right?

15:23.400 --> 15:26.300
-Jackie? Ja--Janice?
- Sorry,bud,game over.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.000
Jill.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.000
How do you know my name?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
Are you using drugs of any kind?

16:12.100 --> 16:13.200
No,of course not.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.000
You drink anything with a kick last night?

16:15.200 --> 16:18.200
Would red bull... do this to me?

16:18.900 --> 16:19.600
No.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.200
Do me a favor,kendrick,and tell me your address.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.300
sixty...seven...

16:29.500 --> 16:30.300
Hey,doc.

16:30.900 --> 16:31.500
Yeah.

16:32.100 --> 16:36.700
My body is...tingling.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.000
??

16:44.400 --> 16:45.900
All right,push down on my hand.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.300
- What happened?
- We don't know.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.100
What do you mean we don't know?

16:48.200 --> 16:49.400
Well,he was fine yesterday,

16:49.600 --> 16:51.700
At least according to his executive physical.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.100
Okay,labs and stress test all came back normal.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.100
Dtrs are decreased bilaterally.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.500
Hypotonia,more in the lower extremities.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.400
Guillain-Barre?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.300
Possibly,but he has no pain.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.900
Squeeze my hands.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.300
Squeeze. Hard!

17:06.500 --> 17:07.400
Come on,kendrick.

17:07.900 --> 17:08.900
I have to play...

17:09.700 --> 17:11.900
F-F-Football.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.200
All right,we should get him to the hospital for further testing.

17:14.300 --> 17:14.900
No!

17:15.400 --> 17:17.400
We need this handled quietly.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.000
Look,there are a lot of variables right now

17:19.099 --> 17:21.099
That we can't plan for in your home.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.900
That's why hospitals exist.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.900
I'd really feel more comfortable--

17:24.000 --> 17:25.200
I'd feel less comfortable.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.700
Five years ago,my husband walked into a hospital With chest pain.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
Within 20 minutes,it was leaked to the media.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.900
The next day he lost the iowa caucus,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.200
Because the opposition was able to smear him As a man with a weak heart overnight.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.400
Turns out it was just a bad case of indigestion.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.700
Dr. Lawson,You were not just  hired for kendrick's health.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
You were also hired for his privacy

17:46.400 --> 17:48.900
And to make sure that he plays football at notre dame

17:49.800 --> 17:53.600
And then goes on to lead a successful life as planned.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.700
I will not put my family In the hands of the system again.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.000
To diagnose this properly,i'd need--

18:01.100 --> 18:02.600
I'll get you whatever you need.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.100
Or just say that you're giving up on him,

18:06.500 --> 18:08.000
And i'll find someone else.

18:17.900 --> 18:18.900
Hank,look.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.900
The way i see it,we have two options:

18:21.200 --> 18:23.900
We can keep fighting her,or we can start helping him.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.800
All right,well,how are we gonna get a mobile mri?

18:25.900 --> 18:27.100
Let me worry about that.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.200
Oh,god.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.600
Wha--Did you just big-Time me?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.900
Anyway,i have two news alerts.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.200
I ran into a friend of yours,and i did you a major solid.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.100
Two,this car needs gas.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.300
Circle back with me asap to discuss.

19:10.000 --> 19:10.900
Hello,ms. Newberg.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.100
Evan r. Lawson.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.200
I'm the cfo of hankmed.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.500
The...hank--Hank's brother.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.600
Oh,hank!

19:24.200 --> 19:25.700
-Please,come in.
- Cool.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.700
So how is hank doing?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.300
Uh,he's doing very well.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.300
And so are you.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.700
Uh,you look fantastic,ma'am.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.700
- Thank you,dear. - Yeah.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.800
So,uh,so naturally beautiful.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.900
And splendidly symmetrical.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.100
Yes,i know.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.000
How can i help you?

19:47.600 --> 19:50.600
Oh,no,miss newberg,it's how i can help you.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.600
May i offer you a vitamin-Infused gin rickey?

19:55.100 --> 19:55.800
Yep.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.400
Esperanza?

19:57.700 --> 19:58.300
Perfect.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.000
Oh,that'll be great.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.660
All right,talk to you soon.Bye.

20:04.660 --> 20:06.270
Okay,I tracked it down.It's there.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.810
You just need to ask for it.

20:07.810 --> 20:10.080
Good work,divya.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.710
Melody.

20:15.020 --> 20:19.120
I think maybeI did this to him.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.650
Please don't tell my mom.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.600
Tell me what you mean.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.860
When I tackled himthis weekend during a game with our cousins,

20:25.860 --> 20:29.250
his head hit the groundreally hard.

20:29.250 --> 20:33.410
And he didn't get upfor a few seconds.

20:33.410 --> 20:36.310
No,his symptomsaren't consistent with trauma.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.570
You didn't do thisto him,melody.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.910
Look,what you're feelingisn't guilt.

20:40.910 --> 20:43.570
It's just love and concern.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.130
No mom could ever blame youfor that.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.800
Oh,you don't know my mom.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.020
Kendrick's future is her life.

20:49.020 --> 20:52.540
Notre dame's justthe first step,and then it's offto a top five law school,

20:52.540 --> 20:57.100
the justice department,congress,and ultimately achieving what my father couldn'T.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.270
If I did anythingto jeopardize all that,

20:59.270 --> 21:02.730
she'd saythat I ruined his life.

21:02.730 --> 21:07.100
She'd say I ruined her plan.

21:11.530 --> 21:13.000
What's the catch?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.080
There's no fine print here,ms.Newberg.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.170
Well,it sounds likea very interesting proposal.

21:17.170 --> 21:18.480
I thoughtyou'd feel that way.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.620
Do you have any literature?

21:19.620 --> 21:21.860
Funny you should ask.

21:22.460 --> 21:25.100
Hot off the press.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.140
******

21:27.140 --> 21:28.880
Oh,thanks.

21:30.830 --> 21:33.430
Well,I'll pass this onto my advisors.

21:33.430 --> 21:35.650
And if they approve,then I'm in.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.280
Hank would be so thrilled...

21:37.280 --> 21:40.980
hank,our savior.

21:41.270 --> 21:45.050
-God bless him.
-Amen to that.

21:45.050 --> 21:47.940
And you seemvery competent too.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.690
You must meetmy little granddaughter.

21:50.690 --> 21:52.980
Uh,thank you,ms.Newberg.You know,I-

21:52.980 --> 21:54.710
she's spending the summerwith me.

21:54.710 --> 21:56.410
I'm--I'm really notvery good with kids.

21:56.410 --> 21:57.950
Emma,come here,sweetie.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.020
It's just not-

22:02.920 --> 22:07.100
This gentleman workswith the doctor who saved me last week.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.450
Ah,your faux nichons.

22:10.450 --> 22:12.320
She's been studying in paris.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.760
Oh,that is too funny,because this very afternoon

22:15.760 --> 22:17.940
I'm actually hosting a reception

22:17.940 --> 22:21.330
to celebrate the european architectural influences at my home,shadow pond.

22:21.330 --> 22:23.410
Isn't that so weird?You should come.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.750
Shadow pond?That sounds likean assisted living facility.

22:26.750 --> 22:31.480
Yeah,you know-yeah,you're probablynot interested in getting culture

22:31.480 --> 22:32.640
during your break from school.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.730
-Probably not?
-She needs culture.

22:34.730 --> 22:37.210
Nana,please,don't micromanage.

22:37.210 --> 22:40.820
I promised your mom you would not spendthe entire summer

22:40.820 --> 22:44.850
watching the mountains and gossiping about iton headbook.

22:44.850 --> 22:48.480
It's the hills,and it's facebook.

22:48.480 --> 22:52.450
Go to this nice man'sreception,bring your friends.

22:52.450 --> 22:57.790
Or there's no salt scrubsat the maidstone for a week.

22:58.220 --> 23:01.130
How many friends exactly?

23:03.860 --> 23:05.990
Excuse me,I'm looking for--ah.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.680
Oh,nice.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.570
No crossing guard jokes,please.

23:14.570 --> 23:17.020
No,I was just gonna askif you were missing a lifeboat.

23:17.020 --> 23:22.420
Look,uh,I know we just met,but I need a favor,and it's a big one.

23:22.420 --> 23:24.240
How big?

23:24.240 --> 23:26.930
The size of a truck.

23:29.910 --> 23:31.880
I'm sorry,but I can't say.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.140
You can't say who.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.210
No,I can't say anything.

23:35.210 --> 23:38.090
Well,that doesn't give memuch to go on during our busiest weekendof the summer.

23:38.090 --> 23:39.310
I know,I know.

23:39.310 --> 23:40.750
Why don't you try the hospitalin riverhead?

23:40.750 --> 23:42.760
They have an mri truckand one-tenth our caseload.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.990
No,I-I can'T.Time really is a factor here.

23:45.990 --> 23:47.950
So you want me to lendmy mri truck to someone

23:47.950 --> 23:49.990
who doesn't feellike dealing with the traffic?

23:49.990 --> 23:52.190
No,no--no.I wouldn't ask for itif that were the case.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.020
You'rea concierge doctor,hank.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.680
I have patients.You have clients.

23:55.680 --> 24:00.030
And I can't move a mountainevery time a ceo sneezes.

24:00.030 --> 24:02.150
It's not a ceo.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.590
It's a teenage boy with acuteneurological deficits,

24:04.590 --> 24:08.820
and we both knowthat can kill you,regardless of how bigyour trust fund is.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.780
This boy needs help.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.120
He needs it fast.

24:12.120 --> 24:16.970
And I'm not asking youto move a mountain,just a truck.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.760
Looks like we don't needthe mri for the next two hours.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.770
I'm paging a tech right now.

24:28.770 --> 24:31.720
Great.Great.Thank you,really.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.560
You know,despite my freakishlycalm demeanor,

24:33.560 --> 24:36.840
it wasn't easy for meto come here and ask youfor something like this.

24:36.840 --> 24:41.660
That doesn't surprise mecoming from a guy who can't even ask me outhimself.

24:41.660 --> 24:44.210
Anyway,I just found outthat I have to work tonight.

24:44.210 --> 24:45.550

How did you meet evan?

24:54.290 --> 24:56.330
Uh,randomly in town.

24:56.330 --> 25:00.070
He asked me out to dinner,you know,on your behalf.

25:00.070 --> 25:01.360
He did,did he?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.040
How helpful of him.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.850
He's a good guy.

25:04.850 --> 25:09.500
Not that he,um,totally misrepresented me.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.520
I mean,it's possiblethat at some point,I would-

25:11.520 --> 25:16.010
ms.Casey,we're readyfor the mock evacuation drill.

25:16.010 --> 25:17.140
Got to go.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.850
You better bring my truck backwashed and waxed.

25:21.490 --> 25:28.290
Oh,washed,waxed,with the pine-tree thing hang-hang-

25:45.780 --> 25:47.660
I mean,who else do you need?

25:47.660 --> 25:49.960
You saidthis was a reception.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.940
Yeah,everyone else apparentlyhad scheduling conflicts.

25:51.940 --> 25:53.290
Yeah,or self-respect.

25:53.290 --> 25:56.180
Hey,guys,maybe we should bail.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.710
Maybe after a quick dip?

25:57.710 --> 26:01.000
Couldn't hurt,right?

26:24.040 --> 26:26.090
Nancy,I need you.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.230
So do any of you girls read the new england journal of medicine?

26:31.230 --> 26:33.160
Uh,no.

Oh,all right.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.050
Allie,you are really beautiful.

26:38.050 --> 26:39.770
Sorry,I just had to say it,you know?

26:39.770 --> 26:42.880
You probably comefrom beautiful parents too,huh?

26:42.880 --> 26:44.570
Are they alive and well?

26:44.570 --> 26:46.830
-Uh,yeah.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.100
No hereditaryconditions or anything?

26:49.100 --> 26:51.540
Just divorce.

26:53.700 --> 26:55.600
Feels pretty magical,huh?

26:55.600 --> 27:01.540
There are a few thingsit won't cure,like,uh,osteoarthritis.Right?

27:01.540 --> 27:03.870
Or gingivitis or a severe gluten allergy.

27:03.870 --> 27:05.770
Excuse me.

Restless leg syndrome?

27:16.100 --> 27:18.740

You know what?Neither have I,man.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.370
But this is officialhankmed business.

27:33.370 --> 27:37.170

27:49.510 --> 27:54.110
Yeah,would you like to discuss the historyof the turkish bath?

27:54.110 --> 27:58.040
Or we could just dosome shots.

Oh,yeah?Why is that?

28:05.810 --> 28:08.680
'Cause she might bethe one in ten.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.040
One in ten--it's a business term.Yeah,don't worry about it.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.530

28:35.640 --> 28:37.080
You first.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.270
And then you...

28:41.340 --> 28:42.890
What is this?

28:42.890 --> 28:45.060
Oh,my god!I have it too!

28:45.060 --> 28:46.130
What the hell?

28:46.130 --> 28:49.880
Mine is itching!Mine is burning!Mine is spreading!

28:49.880 --> 28:52.120
What the hell?

28:52.690 --> 28:54.410
What is taking so long?

28:54.410 --> 28:57.610
Telemedicine movesat its own pace.

28:58.650 --> 29:00.060
What did the radiologist say?

29:00.060 --> 29:02.030
Mri's totally normal.

29:02.030 --> 29:04.460
Okay,let's do this.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.730
Spinal needle.

29:12.370 --> 29:13.780
It's clear.

29:13.780 --> 29:17.520
No gross blood,no xanthochromia.

29:18.260 --> 29:21.620
All right,get a cell counton tubes 1 and 4.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.430
C and s on 3,protein on 2.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.530
Cryptococcus antigenon number four.

29:25.530 --> 29:28.380
I'll update his mother.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.800
It's for the best,do you understand that?

29:30.800 --> 29:32.560
It's done with.

29:32.560 --> 29:36.430
Okay,uh,let me bring youup to speed on what we've ruled out so far.

29:36.430 --> 29:42.100
It's not guillain-barre,myasthenia gravis,botulism,or a structural lesion.

29:42.100 --> 29:43.420
We may have to repeatthe spinal tap-

29:43.420 --> 29:45.040
she's airlifting himto cornell.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.290
-What?
-They have the top specialists.

29:47.290 --> 29:50.090
I've arrangeda john doe admission,completely off the grid.

29:50.090 --> 29:53.030
No,no,no.He's no longer in any conditionfor transfer.

29:53.030 --> 29:55.320
They'll figure outwhat's happening to him.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.320
They'll runthe same tests I did.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.970
Look,it'll waste timehe doesn't have.He's deteriorating.

29:59.970 --> 30:01.050
And who let that happen?

30:01.050 --> 30:04.110
You did,mom!You should've taken himto the hospital before.

30:04.110 --> 30:08.210
The doctor and iwill handle this.Is that okay?

30:08.210 --> 30:10.520
Ma'am,look.I know this is hard.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.620
You have dreamsyou want to protect.You expect--

30:12.620 --> 30:17.580
people said I had the good planof marrying into a fortune.

30:17.580 --> 30:24.160
Truth is,my husbandhad the good fortune of marryinginto a plan,my plan.

30:24.160 --> 30:31.890
I took edfrom obscure entrepreneur to federal reserve directorto united states senator.

30:31.890 --> 30:34.100
And that's as faras the race took him.

30:34.100 --> 30:40.030
Kendrick is going to havethe whole package without any missteps.

30:40.030 --> 30:46.500
I have a plan for that boy,not as a dreamer,but as a mother.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.160
I know you love your son.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.950
But you need to stop fixatingon his destiny and start worryingabout his life,

30:51.950 --> 30:54.740
because he can't be presidentif he's dead.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.080
Hank!

30:56.080 --> 30:59.410
He's in respiratory arrest.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.400
All right,I'm ready.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.550
Tube,please.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.380
It's in.

31:23.140 --> 31:25.650
Okay,go ahead.

31:27.170 --> 31:29.680
Okay,bag him.

31:33.790 --> 31:36.240
Okay,his breathing is stable.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.590
Monitor him carefully for any signsof cerebral edema.

31:39.590 --> 31:40.550
-Come talk to me.
-If he goes...

31:40.550 --> 31:44.090
hypertensive and bradycardic,we hit him with a mannitoland then the lasix,

31:44.090 --> 31:46.050
and we hyperventilate him.

31:46.050 --> 31:48.670
Exactly.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.910
Just give himmore time,mom.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.460
No,instead of getting better,he's just getting worse.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.970
Mrs.Everett,the chopper is here.

31:57.970 --> 32:00.640
Tell it to go away,nancy.The doctor saidit's already too late.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.560
Excuse me.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.320
I am in charge.Is that okay?

32:04.320 --> 32:06.070
No,it's not okay.

32:06.070 --> 32:09.210
Kendrickdoesn't want your help,and he doesn't want your plan.

32:09.210 --> 32:10.950
He doesn't even wantto be president.

32:10.950 --> 32:14.380
He just wants to play football,but he didn't wantto disappoint you,

32:14.380 --> 32:15.780
so he went along with it.

32:15.780 --> 32:19.210
Now,just letthe doctor do his job.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.680
Did kendrickreally tell you that?

32:25.680 --> 32:27.170
He tried to tellyou too,mom.

32:27.170 --> 32:29.280
You would know that if youstopped for a sec to listen,

32:29.280 --> 32:36.540
but you're always too busydoing the talking,whispering in his ear,putting all your stuffin there.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.960
You're never going joggingwith me again.

32:51.670 --> 32:52.980
Melody.

32:52.980 --> 32:56.670
When you tackled kendrickthis weekend,his head hit the grass.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.420
-Yeah,why?
-Kendrick hit his head?

32:59.420 --> 33:00.890
Why didn't you tell me?

33:00.890 --> 33:02.190
You saidthat I didn't do this.

33:02.190 --> 33:07.090
I think all you've doneto your brother,melody,is save him.

33:17.530 --> 33:21.640
Alligator forcepsand mineral oil.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.820
What are you doing?

33:23.820 --> 33:27.090
I'm neutralizingthe parasite.

33:31.550 --> 33:32.440
Forceps.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.510
What parasite in the hamptonscould cause all this?

33:35.510 --> 33:40.300
A very,very small one.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.490
Deer tick.

33:43.490 --> 33:47.770
Once this little guy managedto crawl right into his ear,it fed on his bloodto make eggs.

33:47.770 --> 33:52.500
It's salivary glandsecreted a neurotoxin which caused a rapidlyascending paralysis.

33:52.500 --> 33:53.800
Oh,my god.

33:53.800 --> 33:54.850
Is he gonna be okay?

33:54.850 --> 33:59.210
Well,with the tick removed,the poison will dissipatejust as rapidly.

33:59.210 --> 34:02.180
He's gonna be fine.

34:02.900 --> 34:06.560
Bro,serious troubleback at the bat cave.

34:06.560 --> 34:13.010
I need you and divya and all your little gadgetsand ointments back here stat.

34:20.719 --> 34:22.449
There he is.

Welcome back,buddy.You're gonna be fine.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.480

34:42.650 --> 34:44.590
Thank you.

34:44.590 --> 34:46.010
I'm glad to have you back.

34:46.010 --> 34:48.429
-Sure.
-Yeah,right.

34:49.560 --> 34:53.150
Melody has never stood upto me like that before.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.580
Well,she was protectingher brother.

34:55.580 --> 34:59.590
She was asserting herself...

34:59.590 --> 35:04.350
showing signs of leadership.

35:10.830 --> 35:13.800
Thank you.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.700
Why do I have 11 voice mails?

35:17.700 --> 35:19.940
I think I know why.

35:19.940 --> 35:21.760
What is it,evan?

35:22.510 --> 35:25.170
He's been busy,very busy.

35:25.170 --> 35:27.940
Okay,relax.Just tell me the problem.

35:27.940 --> 35:31.010
He sent me 23 pictures too.

35:31.010 --> 35:33.220
Wait,stop.

35:33.220 --> 35:35.620
You were in a jacuzzi.

35:35.620 --> 35:36.950
Hot tub folliculitis.

35:36.950 --> 35:39.130
The filtration systemis broken.

35:39.130 --> 35:42.890
Just soak some hot towelsin household vinegar.

35:42.890 --> 35:46.430
Apply the compressfor 20 minutes two to four times a day.

35:46.430 --> 35:51.730
You'll all be fineby next week,although you'll still bean idiot.

35:51.730 --> 35:54.530
You'd makea great older brother.

35:58.570 --> 36:00.590
Quite a thingwe just pulled off.

36:00.590 --> 36:03.740
Well,who needs hospitalsafter all?

36:03.740 --> 36:08.180
So I guess we need to figure outyour compensation,stuff like that.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.970
-Whatever you think is fair.
-And your title.

36:10.970 --> 36:13.000
Well,what's wrongwith physician assistant?

36:13.000 --> 36:16.470
Yeah,people seem to only hearthe second half of it.

36:16.470 --> 36:18.680
I was thinking...

36:18.680 --> 36:21.570
associate.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.990
Did you not get my calls?

36:35.990 --> 36:37.260
I turned my phone off.

36:37.260 --> 36:38.820
You did what?Never do that.

36:38.820 --> 36:41.080
I heard aboutyour hot tub mishap.Nice.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.680
"Mishap"?

36:43.680 --> 36:45.590
It was a disaster,henry!

36:45.590 --> 36:48.300
I spent all day tryingto convince these girls I wasn't a douche bag,

36:48.300 --> 36:50.220
and they left smellinglike vinegar and water.

36:50.220 --> 36:51.370
What was goingthrough your head?

36:51.370 --> 36:52.730
Nothingbut our strategic plan.

36:52.730 --> 36:54.480
Your strategic plan.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.640
No,our pla--the plan-to turn ten womeninto one patient.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.250
But then only three showed up,and I-

36:59.250 --> 37:01.070
you turned them allinto patients.

37:01.070 --> 37:04.990
I di-it made much more senseon paper,okay?

37:04.990 --> 37:08.210
Look,if we're gonna dothis together,you need to take it seriously

37:08.210 --> 37:13.080
and really pitch in,like a grown-up.

37:15.130 --> 37:17.240
What's this?

37:17.710 --> 37:20.620
It's just me pitching in.

37:20.620 --> 37:23.200
You are looking at our veryfirst summer retainer.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.900
-Who retained us?
-One ms."New parts" newberg,

37:25.900 --> 37:29.380
who now has 24-7 access to youby phone or by house call

37:29.380 --> 37:33.280
and guaranteedsame-day appointments,including all lab workand specialty referrals.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.140
24-7?That woman will drive me crazy.

37:35.140 --> 37:38.980
And that's whatit's gonna cost her...

37:38.980 --> 37:41.750
per month.

37:44.090 --> 37:45.730
You're gonna be fine,benny.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.250
I told him notto take this job.

37:47.250 --> 37:48.350
Tu nunca me escucha.

37:48.350 --> 37:49.720
Please,ma,not now.

37:49.720 --> 37:52.320
You were supposed to be a vet,not a dog walker.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.930
This is like being a busboyinstead of a chef.

37:54.930 --> 37:56.450
How is that the same?

37:56.450 --> 37:59.340
You're right.Busboys get tips.

37:59.340 --> 38:02.760
Mami,please,you're making my hand hurt.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.280
Hank,you got a cure for this?

38:04.280 --> 38:05.990
Look,you're in great shape,benny,all right?

38:05.990 --> 38:08.260
If you haveany problems,just-you just call me.

38:08.260 --> 38:11.050
Thank you,doctor.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.530
Jill.

38:13.530 --> 38:15.810
I was just visitinga friend.

38:15.810 --> 38:17.350
I heard all about it.

38:17.350 --> 38:18.530
Want to grab a bite?

38:18.530 --> 38:23.360
-Oh,I thought-
-I have a few minutes,and I know a great placeright near here.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.260
Best I could doon such short notice.

38:25.260 --> 38:28.160
Hey,I love carousel cuisine.

38:28.160 --> 38:33.640
I got my eyeon a 2007 chocolate milk that I've heardvery good things about.

38:33.640 --> 38:38.220
So I-I guess we have evanto thank for this.

38:38.220 --> 38:41.540
So you and your brotherseem pretty different.

38:41.540 --> 38:43.580
On a good day,very different.

38:43.580 --> 38:44.990
I don't know.I guess evenin your own family,

38:44.990 --> 38:48.770
it's rare to find a personyou really connect with.

38:48.770 --> 38:51.220
Then you meet someoneat a party.

38:51.220 --> 38:54.920
But you wonder if they seethe world in the same way.

38:54.920 --> 38:55.830
You do?

38:55.830 --> 38:58.220
Yeah,I do.I mean...

38:58.220 --> 39:00.550
who are you,hank?

39:00.550 --> 39:04.180
Are you the guy whois lining up $2 million magnets for people

39:04.180 --> 39:09.750
who can affordto buy their own,or are you the guy who's making surethat the local dog

39:09.750 --> 39:14.000
walker doesn't lose his hand becausehe can't afford to save it?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.030
Well,why do I have to chooseone over the other?

39:16.030 --> 39:17.960
I mean,they both need my help.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.070
But concierge doctorshelp rich people.

39:20.070 --> 39:21.590
Isn't that the idea?

39:21.590 --> 39:25.630
Well,I may havea slightly different idea.

39:25.950 --> 39:31.850
I really hope yournew business succeeds,hank,but...

39:31.850 --> 39:35.350
It has to succeedwithout my favors.

39:35.350 --> 39:38.660
My job is to help peoplewho come to the hospital,not people who won'T.

39:38.660 --> 39:42.020
Yeah,I'm sorry if I put you in an uncomfortable position.

39:42.020 --> 39:44.570
In a way,I'm glad you did.

39:44.570 --> 39:46.480
Yeah,why's that?

39:46.480 --> 39:51.490
I think it's cutethat we had our first fight before our first date.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.880
Yeah,me too.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.500
Mmm,this pizzais oddly refreshing.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.380
That's becauseit's a lemon strudel.

40:01.180 --> 40:02.780
Oh,yeah,that makes sense.

40:02.780 --> 40:05.660
Ms.Casey,they need you in oncology.

40:06.010 --> 40:08.100
I'm sorry.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.770
I've gotta go put out a fire.

40:09.770 --> 40:12.520
Uh,can I walk youto your fire?

40:12.520 --> 40:15.330
Have a good night,hank.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.490
How were the high seas?

40:38.490 --> 40:41.860
So quiet,no disturbances at all.

40:44.470 --> 40:47.210
So,how arethe everetts doing?

40:47.210 --> 40:51.250
Lucy still have everythingon,uh,track over there?

40:51.250 --> 40:53.990
I'm glad you enjoyedyour outing.

40:56.680 --> 41:01.230
I'm sure mrs.Everettwill appreciate your respectfor confidentiality.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.940
-Hey,boris.
-Yes?

41:06.450 --> 41:09.450
Thanks for the referral.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.810
Don't mention it.

41:13.920 --> 41:17.060
I've got plans for you,hank.
