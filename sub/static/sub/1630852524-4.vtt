Oh, wow.
Oh, my gosh!

00:26.666 --> 00:28.416
This is so exciting.
This is so eerie.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.125
This looks, like, exactly like
a place we would've had brunch,

00:31.208 --> 00:32.750
down to the tables
and everything.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.833

I have to tell you,
I'm such a fan.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.500
I mean, when they told me
that Donna DiMarco

00:51.583 --> 00:53.041
was playing me,
my jaw dropped.

00:53.125 --> 00:54.916
You know, you're just a legend.
- Oh, thank you.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.333
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, and then

00:56.416 --> 00:58.791
I just was like, wait,
are we the same age?

00:58.875 --> 01:00.375
- I'm not that much older,
but, um--

01:00.458 --> 01:03.750
- Anyway, I'm so happy
that you're acting still.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.666
- Yes!
Oh, gosh, yes, girl.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.375
I am thriving.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.166
Yeah, ever since I became
a mom,

01:09.250 --> 01:10.416
I've been making

01:10.500 --> 01:12.416
these antibiotic lollipops now
for kiddos,

01:12.500 --> 01:15.666
so I just boil doxycycline,
a little bit of simple syrup,

01:15.750 --> 01:17.458
try to keep it all organic,
all that stuff.

01:17.541 --> 01:18.625
You have kids?
- No.

01:18.708 --> 01:19.833

- Nate.

01:30.708 --> 01:32.625
- And I'm playing your GBF.
- Eek!

01:32.708 --> 01:34.375
- Elliott is such a riot.
- Yeah.

01:34.458 --> 01:36.333
- Oh, my God,
he's got a twisted mind.

01:36.416 --> 01:38.500
It's crazy he believes
any of the stuff he says.

01:38.583 --> 01:39.833
- Yeah.
- You know, it's probably

01:39.916 --> 01:41.000

- Oh, I'm still friends
with them.

01:47.916 --> 01:51.750
I do love them.
Very much, actually.

I'm so happy
you're playing Drew.

02:02.666 --> 02:06.541
I think it's so cool
that they...did that.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.541
- Well, you're playing
an Iraqi American woman.

02:09.625 --> 02:12.000
- That is true.
- I--sorry.

02:12.083 --> 02:14.166
I just--I had this idea
for Portia.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.333
- Great.

02:15.416 --> 02:16.708
- So I thought
that Portia could, like,

02:16.791 --> 02:18.875
always be chewing gum
in the scenes, right?

02:18.958 --> 02:20.583
But just, like, really, like--
[smacks gums]

02:20.666 --> 02:22.375
Really open-mouth,
like, chewing,

02:22.458 --> 02:25.541
and then anytime
anyone said anything shocking,

02:25.625 --> 02:27.833
she could be like--
[smacks gum]

02:27.916 --> 02:29.125
Does that kind of vibe
with who you--

02:29.208 --> 02:30.541
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.250
- Portia, I'm here
for just a few minutes

02:32.333 --> 02:33.708
for a fitting.
- Hi.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.291
- And I wanted to say hi
while I was on set today.

02:35.375 --> 02:36.625
- So nice to meet you.
- I'm Charlotte. Hi.

02:36.708 --> 02:37.916
- Hi, Charlotte.
Who are you playing?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.041
- I'm playing Chantal.

- No.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.708
- Sorry?
- What?

02:42.791 --> 02:44.875
No, sorry, not no.

02:44.958 --> 02:47.750
Sorry, this is just--
this is all so interesting.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.583
[laughter]

02:49.666 --> 02:53.708
This is...so...interesting.

02:57.833 --> 02:59.541
- I had to look for you.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.625
Do you know
how stressful that was?

03:01.708 --> 03:03.125
It was dark

03:03.208 --> 03:07.958
and I thought every mailbox
that I passed was you.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.250
I couldn't catch a break.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.916
Then my coat got snagged
in the car door

03:13.000 --> 03:15.250
in the middle of Skid Row.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.625
And my shoe fell off,

03:16.708 --> 03:19.291
and I stepped
on the cold street

03:19.375 --> 03:20.666
with my bare foot.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.666
What a fiasco, by the way.

03:22.750 --> 03:25.083
And all I could think was
if you were okay.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.958
- Well, hello, neighbor!

03:27.041 --> 03:28.666
[laughs]

03:28.750 --> 03:29.958
- Excuse me very much!

03:30.041 --> 03:32.208
What do you think
you are up to?

03:32.291 --> 03:34.125
- I'm decorating.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.791
It sounded like
maybe you didn't have

03:35.875 --> 03:37.208
a plan to do so,

03:37.291 --> 03:40.458
and so I thought,
why not help you do your share

03:40.541 --> 03:42.041
to spread some seasonal cheer.

03:42.125 --> 03:45.125
- Well, I'll have you know
that this is my property.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.166
And I must ask you
to leave immediately.

I tried to be nice,

03:59.041 --> 04:00.500

within the next six seconds.

and tell them
the patient's dead?

27:33.083 --> 27:34.375
- Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.750
Yeah, that's--that is weird.

Ooh.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.791
I don't like this.

27:38.875 --> 27:41.375
I'm starting to get
freaked out.

27:41.458 --> 27:43.666
- Okay, so...

27:43.750 --> 27:47.166
yeah, so no one knows
where Dory is, right?

27:49.333 --> 27:52.375
So...she's missing.

27:54.166 --> 27:57.708
You know, I mean,
we don't owe her this, but...

27:59.791 --> 28:03.041
Like maybe we look into it?

28:03.125 --> 28:04.750
- I mean, yeah,
let's look into it,

28:04.833 --> 28:06.125
but, you know,
doesn't have to be

28:06.208 --> 28:08.291
like a huge search
or anything.

28:08.375 --> 28:11.333
- Yeah.
It's probably nothing.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.666
But maybe we should
look into it.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.541
- Yeah.

28:16.625 --> 28:17.625
