00:42.870 --> 00:47.041
<i>This is the world. There are
almost six billion people on it.</i>

00:47.291 --> 00:51.671
<i>When I was a kid there were three.
It's hard to keep up.</i>

00:53.340 --> 00:56.218
<i>There, that's better. That's America.</i>

00:56.468 --> 00:59.763
<i>America still sets
the tone for the world.</i>

01:01.890 --> 01:05.811
<i>In Indiana, Clark Hodd.
The country's best point guard.</i>

01:06.061 --> 01:10.399
<i>Last week he scored 100 points
in a single game.</i>

01:10.649 --> 01:14.779
<i>Erica Sorgi.
You'll see her in the next Olympics.</i>

01:15.905 --> 01:18.742
<i>In Seattle, Dallas Malloy, 16.</i>

01:18.992 --> 01:22.120
<i>Her lawsuit paved the way
for women boxers.</i>

01:22.954 --> 01:25.457
<i>She's picturing her ex-boyfriend.</i>

01:26.333 --> 01:29.169
<i>In Indio, California. Art Stallings.</i>

01:29.419 --> 01:31.963
<i>Check out what pure joy looks like.</i>

01:32.464 --> 01:36.093
<i>In Odessa, Texas.
The great Frank Cushman.</i>

01:36.469 --> 01:41.891
<i>This April, 26 teams will be falling
over themselves to sign him.</i>

01:42.141 --> 01:44.602
<i>He's my most important client.</i>

01:44.810 --> 01:47.730
When are you gonna try
and concentrate?!

01:47.980 --> 01:52.985
<i>There's genius everywhere.
It's like popcorn. Some pop...</i>

01:53.194 --> 01:56.239
Coach, you don't know
diddly about golf!

01:56.448 --> 01:57.783
<i>... some don't.</i>

01:59.701 --> 02:02.120
<i>I'm the guy you don't usually see.</i>

02:02.371 --> 02:05.666
<i>I'm behind the scenes.
I'm the sports agent.</i>

02:05.916 --> 02:08.627
I'm gonna hurt you this year.

02:08.835 --> 02:13.215
My door's always open if you
want to get a real agent.

02:13.423 --> 02:15.218
You're welcome, Johnny.

02:15.426 --> 02:19.764
I'll go to a meeting now to talk
about you. I'd kill for you.

02:19.972 --> 02:22.684
- We've gotta win.
- I hail you.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.936
Jerry, how are you doing?

02:25.269 --> 02:29.774
- How much is this going to cost?
- We both know what you can afford.

02:30.024 --> 02:32.318
I'll just write it down.

02:33.861 --> 02:37.991
- I can't afford that.
- Winning isn't cheap.

02:38.784 --> 02:42.579
<i>You know the photos of
the new player with the owner?</i>

02:42.830 --> 02:44.665
<i>That's me on the left.</i>

02:44.873 --> 02:49.753
<i>This is where I work. SMI.
Sports Management International.</i>

02:51.380 --> 02:54.134
<i>Thirty-three agents
guiding the careers...</i>

02:54.342 --> 02:59.180
<i>... of 1685 of the most
finely tuned athletes alive.</i>

03:00.390 --> 03:02.767
<i>I handle the lives and dreams...</i>

03:02.976 --> 03:06.813
<i>... of 72 clients and get
264 phone calls a day.</i>

03:07.022 --> 03:10.316
I will not rest until
you hold a Coke...

03:10.525 --> 03:13.528
...in a new commercial
starring you...

03:13.778 --> 03:17.533
...broadcast during a Super Bowl
game you're winning.

03:17.783 --> 03:20.119
<i>It's what I do best.</i>

03:20.578 --> 03:24.206
<i>I noticed a few years ago,
and didn't say a word.</i>

03:24.457 --> 03:26.751
Was the girl 16 or 17?

03:27.001 --> 03:29.920
<i>Wanting the big dollar,
things went wrong.</i>

03:30.171 --> 03:35.510
There's no proof of anything.
This guy is a sensational athlete.

03:36.553 --> 03:39.139
Are you Calvin Nack?
Can you sign my card?

03:41.224 --> 03:44.519
I'm sorry, fella, I can't sign this.

03:44.770 --> 03:49.733
- Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
- Just wanted an autograph.

03:49.983 --> 03:52.861
<i>Lately, it's gotten worse.</i>

03:54.071 --> 03:56.616
<i>Oh, he goes down!</i>

03:58.785 --> 03:59.869
Hi, baby.

04:01.412 --> 04:03.081
Do you know your name?

04:10.046 --> 04:14.968
Wait, it's coming.
My name is Steve Remo.

04:15.219 --> 04:18.972
I play for Chicago.
This lady here is my wife.

04:19.932 --> 04:21.225
Hi, baby.

04:21.475 --> 04:24.978
This is my boy. And this is...

04:27.022 --> 04:28.315
Wait.

04:29.358 --> 04:31.568
My agent. My agent.

04:31.777 --> 04:35.824
I gotta play this weekend.
If I play at 65 percent...

04:36.074 --> 04:39.577
...I get a bonus.
I gotta get the bonus.

04:40.453 --> 04:44.999
- Okay, Jesse. Take care, little guy.
- Mr. Maguire?

04:45.250 --> 04:49.754
This is his fourth concussion.
Shouldn't he stop?

04:49.963 --> 04:53.133
It would take a tank
to stop your dad.

04:53.383 --> 04:55.386
It would take all five...

04:55.594 --> 05:00.474
...Super Trooper VR Warriors
to stop your dad.

05:00.725 --> 05:01.892
Right?

05:04.061 --> 05:05.229
Right?

05:06.981 --> 05:08.566
Fuck you!

05:11.527 --> 05:15.031
<i>Who had I become?
Just another shark in a suit?</i>

05:31.965 --> 05:38.097
<i>- Skyrocketing salaries, and you
are one of the guys responsible.</i>

05:38.348 --> 05:41.309
<i>He's a sensational athlete.</i>

05:42.435 --> 05:46.481
<i>Two days later, at our Miami
conference, a breakthrough.</i>

05:46.689 --> 05:48.649
<i>I have $18 million...</i>

05:48.900 --> 05:51.778
<i>Breakdown? Breakthrough.</i>

05:52.028 --> 05:55.656
<i>- I just wanted an autograph.
- Do you know your name?</i>

05:57.242 --> 06:00.913
<i>I couldn't escape one simple thought:</i>

06:02.748 --> 06:04.666
<i>I hated myself.</i>

06:06.335 --> 06:07.920
<i>No, here's what it was:</i>

06:09.046 --> 06:12.174
<i>I hated my place in the world.</i>

06:18.264 --> 06:21.309
<i>I had so much to say,
no one to listen.</i>

06:23.436 --> 06:25.313
<i>And then it happened.</i>

06:28.525 --> 06:33.071
<i>It was the oddest,
most unexpected thing.</i>

06:33.321 --> 06:38.077
<i>I began writing what they call
a mission statement, not a memo.</i>

06:38.327 --> 06:41.789
<i>A suggestion
for the future of our company.</i>

06:43.207 --> 06:47.837
<i>A night like this doesn't
come along often. I seized it.</i>

06:49.755 --> 06:53.592
<i>What started out as one page
became 25.</i>

06:53.843 --> 06:57.014
<i>Suddenly, I was
my father's son again.</i>

06:57.222 --> 07:01.393
<i>I was remembering
the simple pleasures of this job.</i>

07:01.601 --> 07:05.897
<i>The way a stadium sounds
when my player performs well.</i>

07:06.148 --> 07:10.610
<i>The way we're meant to protect them,
in health and in injury.</i>

07:10.861 --> 07:14.990
<i>With so many clients,
we had forgotten what was important.</i>

07:15.490 --> 07:20.288
<i>I wrote and wrote and wrote.
And I'm not even a writer.</i>

07:20.538 --> 07:25.418
<i>I was remembering my mentor's words,
Dicky Fox, who said:</i>

07:25.668 --> 07:29.714
The key to this business
is personal relationships.

07:30.048 --> 07:35.428
<i>Suddenly, it was all pretty clear.
The answer was fewer clients.</i>

07:35.636 --> 07:37.973
<i>Less money. More attention.</i>

07:38.182 --> 07:41.268
<i>Caring for them,
caring for ourselves.</i>

07:41.477 --> 07:44.146
<i>Just starting our lives really!</i>

07:44.396 --> 07:49.401
<i>I'll be the first to admit,
what I was writing was touchy-feely.</i>

07:49.651 --> 07:53.030
<i>I didn't care.
I've lost the ability to bullshit.</i>

07:53.280 --> 07:57.077
<i>It was the me I'd always
wanted to be.</i>

07:59.662 --> 08:03.458
<i>I took it to a Copymat
and printed up 110 copies.</i>

08:03.708 --> 08:07.128
<i>The cover looked like
Catcher in the Rye.</i>

08:07.379 --> 08:12.092
<i>I entitled it,
The Things We Think and Do Not Say:</i>

08:12.342 --> 08:14.594
The Future of Our Business.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.349
That's how you become great, man.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.352
Hang your balls out there.

08:22.478 --> 08:23.979
Thanks.

08:25.481 --> 08:29.860
<i>- Everybody got one.
- Some animals walk on two feet.</i>

08:30.069 --> 08:32.154
<i>They don't want peace.</i>

08:33.197 --> 08:37.577
<i>Society needs protection
from these warped minds.</i>

08:53.301 --> 08:54.344
<i>Boom!</i>

08:56.805 --> 08:59.684
This is Jerry Maguire.
Did those manuscripts...?

08:59.934 --> 09:02.186
<i>- They've all gone out.
- They did?</i>

09:02.437 --> 09:05.314
No, that's fine.

09:05.565 --> 09:07.150
Thank you.

09:35.554 --> 09:37.807
Finally, somebody said it.

09:40.185 --> 09:43.229
- Good work, Maguire.
- Yeah, yeah!

10:00.498 --> 10:02.416
<i>I was 35.</i>

10:02.792 --> 10:05.252
<i>I'd started my life.</i>

10:06.128 --> 10:09.298
- How long do you give him?
- About a week.

10:19.476 --> 10:22.854
- You're with the sports people?
- Jerry Maguire, SMI.

10:23.105 --> 10:27.150
Bobbi Fallon, BPI.
I'm producing the Coke commercials.

10:27.401 --> 10:29.319
Well, good luck with that.

10:31.029 --> 10:35.701
Hi, my son is allergic
to the blankets. I was wondering...

10:35.951 --> 10:38.496
That's all we have, okay?

10:42.667 --> 10:48.089
- I'm sorry if I was rude just now.
- That's okay. We're in it together now.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.301
Why is it so easy to talk with you?
Tell me about your fiancÃ©e.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.888
- We're not at your pitch yet.
- Tell me how you proposed.

10:56.097 --> 10:59.351
Honey, are you all right?
Do you want some juice?

11:00.644 --> 11:05.566
Thank you.
We're hiking up through the pools.

11:05.774 --> 11:09.987
Got the ring in my pocket.
I'm a little nervous.

11:10.821 --> 11:13.115
I'm lagging. She says to me...

11:13.365 --> 11:16.493
...get this:
"Hurry up, klutz."

11:16.702 --> 11:21.458
It bothered me somewhat.
I got quiet. Then she got quiet.

11:21.708 --> 11:26.337
I decide I'm not gonna propose.
The mood is not right.

11:26.546 --> 11:32.093
At this point I know she knows
that I was gonna propose.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.386
She knows I know.

11:33.595 --> 11:36.389
- So we check back into the hotel.
- How sad.

11:36.639 --> 11:42.355
Little do I know that my assistant
assumed that I've now proposed.

11:42.605 --> 11:47.318
She's got a band to play " Here Comes
The Bride" when we walk in.

11:47.568 --> 11:51.072
- I love it.
- All the football guys are watching.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.908
There's even an ESPN crew.

11:54.158 --> 11:57.578
So I turn to her, sort of grandly say:

11:57.828 --> 12:00.582
"This is me, klutz, asking you...

12:00.791 --> 12:04.503
...goddess of rock climbing,
to marry me."

12:04.711 --> 12:10.133
I took out the ring. I mean,
I don't much like big scenes...

12:11.051 --> 12:13.595
...but she said yes right there.

12:13.804 --> 12:16.807
Some of the toughest men
in football wept.

12:18.350 --> 12:23.773
- We're getting married in February.
- You'll be married forever.

12:29.529 --> 12:34.951
- What's wrong, Mom?
- First class is what's wrong, honey.

12:35.702 --> 12:39.038
It used to be a better meal,
now it's a better life.

12:45.254 --> 12:46.755
Ray?

12:48.382 --> 12:49.883
Ray?!

12:51.176 --> 12:52.219
Come on, buddy!

12:52.428 --> 12:54.555
- High five!
- Ray!

12:55.180 --> 12:58.767
- Oh, God. Ray!
- Excuse me, can I help you?

12:59.769 --> 13:01.563
Jerry Maguire.

13:02.188 --> 13:05.316
I work in your office.
I was on a junket.

13:05.525 --> 13:08.153
I know, Dorothy Boyd in Accounts.

13:08.361 --> 13:13.491
You have this poster of Einstein's
face on Shaquille O'Neal's body.

13:14.993 --> 13:16.745
That's pretty good.

13:17.829 --> 13:21.584
- What did you lose?
- My son, my mind.

13:22.501 --> 13:26.172
Ray! Ray!

13:26.797 --> 13:29.008
Listen, Dorothy. Dorothy?

13:29.216 --> 13:32.678
While I go look for him,
grab this gentleman here.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.066
You scared me. You scared me!

13:44.274 --> 13:47.694
- Don't do that again, ever!
- Okay, Mommy.

13:47.903 --> 13:50.697
Ever, ever, ever! Okay? Ever!

13:50.947 --> 13:52.282
Dorothy?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.994
- Take care.
- Thank you so much.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.626
I loved your memo, by the way.

14:03.753 --> 14:05.838
- You did?
- Yeah.

14:09.008 --> 14:13.304
Thanks. Actually, it was
just a mission statement.

14:13.554 --> 14:16.891
In this age,
optimism is a revolutionary act.

14:17.558 --> 14:19.310
- You think so?
- Yeah.

14:19.519 --> 14:23.565
I appreciate that.
I didn't know if I should write it.

14:23.816 --> 14:29.196
It was 2:00 in the morning.
Some of the stuff I just, you know...

14:29.822 --> 14:34.243
No. That part about
embracing what is virginal...

14:34.451 --> 14:36.078
Just a second.

14:36.286 --> 14:41.710
...and force commerce to give
a little back for the greater good.

14:42.168 --> 14:46.840
God, I was inspired,
and I'm an accountant, you know?

14:47.048 --> 14:51.594
I mean, to respect yourself
enough to say it out loud.

14:51.845 --> 14:56.224
To put yourself out there
like that, so nakedly.

14:57.517 --> 15:00.437
I don't know. It got me.

15:04.442 --> 15:07.153
Is this bothering you?

15:07.403 --> 15:10.865
No, this is great.

15:11.782 --> 15:13.826
- It's great.
- One, two, three!

15:14.410 --> 15:16.704
Do you need a ride? You okay?

15:16.954 --> 15:18.372
- What?
- Need a lift?

15:19.290 --> 15:23.795
Oh, no! Yeah, I'm sure
that would just make your day.

15:24.046 --> 15:27.966
To drive us out to Manhattan Beach.
Little tiny streets.

15:28.175 --> 15:32.637
Playing chicken with traffic.
Your life flashing before you.

15:33.805 --> 15:37.392
- I've obviously had too much coffee.
- No problem.

15:37.642 --> 15:42.565
Oh, there's my sister, Laurel,
to pick us up.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.403
Ray...

15:47.820 --> 15:49.030
...Dorothy.

15:49.697 --> 15:51.115
Pleasure.

15:52.075 --> 15:53.618
Bye.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.713
Hey, Ray, hey you.
I'm double-parked, let's go.

16:04.963 --> 16:07.800
Sorry, honey. Is this everything?

16:09.218 --> 16:12.262
- Come here.
- Dorothy?

16:13.097 --> 16:17.684
Man, whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

16:19.686 --> 16:24.401
Don't ever stop fucking me!

16:24.859 --> 16:28.071
Sooner or later we'll have to stop!

16:29.155 --> 16:32.867
Never been better! Never better!

16:33.118 --> 16:35.662
Never better!

16:39.082 --> 16:40.792
Open your eyes.

16:41.042 --> 16:46.424
If you want me to be with another
woman for you, I would do it.

16:46.632 --> 16:50.553
I'm not interested in it.
At a time it felt normal.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.931
But it was a phase. A college thing.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.643
Like torn Levi's
or law school for you.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.937
Want anything from the kitchen?

17:07.070 --> 17:10.782
You don't have to tell me everything.

17:11.032 --> 17:13.118
This is what intimacy is.

17:13.744 --> 17:16.621
We have dinner
with Wade Cooksy tomorrow.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.915
I know about the party.

17:19.124 --> 17:22.378
Your buddy worked
his ass off for this.

17:22.628 --> 17:26.007
All the guys from the office
are coming.

17:26.257 --> 17:31.679
Calm down, relax, act surprised,
and have an amazing time.

17:39.520 --> 17:45.194
- Oh, my God. You! You!
- Sorry.

17:45.444 --> 17:47.237
Jerry!

17:48.072 --> 17:49.782
Got you!

17:53.494 --> 17:58.499
- Hey, college buddy. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.335
- For you.
- Thank you.

18:01.543 --> 18:06.925
And this is for you.
Finest cigar my club has to offer.

18:07.175 --> 18:09.094
This is what it's all about, man.

18:10.678 --> 18:12.347
Everybody loves you.

18:14.599 --> 18:16.476
Pisses me off!

18:17.477 --> 18:20.897
<i>Whether you're country,
redneck or a freak...</i>

18:21.147 --> 18:25.277
<i>... young or old, from Moscow,
London or Memphis...</i>

18:25.528 --> 18:29.615
<i>... Jerry Maguire will still
be the king of rock 'n' roll.</i>

18:30.699 --> 18:36.122
<i>- Little black book.
- When I think of him, my heart pounds.</i>

18:36.414 --> 18:40.501
<i>- I know Jerry pretty well.
- Hi, Jerry, remember me?</i>

18:40.960 --> 18:42.503
We still on for lunch?

18:42.713 --> 18:44.715
<i>He was no slouch in bed.</i>

18:44.923 --> 18:48.176
This is the funniest thing.
See you later.

18:48.427 --> 18:52.806
<i>- Good idea that Jerry get married.
He won't be alone.</i>

18:53.014 --> 18:55.434
<i>- He cannot be alone.
- He can't be alone.</i>

18:55.642 --> 18:56.893
<i>He's almost phobic.</i>

18:57.102 --> 19:01.648
<i>Jerry is great at friendship,
he's just bad at intimacy.</i>

19:01.857 --> 19:04.986
<i>- He can't be alone.
- He can't be alone.</i>

19:05.194 --> 19:10.324
<i>- He can't say, "I love you."
- He's an agent. He lies.</i>

19:10.533 --> 19:13.995
<i>- I love you too.
- Hey, love you too.</i>

19:14.203 --> 19:16.748
<i>- Love you too.
- Love you.</i>

19:17.081 --> 19:18.124
I love you, man.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.048
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

19:37.686 --> 19:41.607
- Morning, Jenny.
- Sorry I missed the party.

19:41.815 --> 19:44.402
Good morning, Jerry. Marcee's here.

19:44.652 --> 19:47.572
She's late for her plane to Phoenix.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.867
- Marcee.
- You finally made it.

19:51.117 --> 19:53.286
Rod is very, very upset.

19:53.536 --> 19:56.081
- Tyson, no!
- Okay, Mommy.

19:56.289 --> 19:59.542
- Tyson, hello.
- Long time no see!

19:59.751 --> 20:02.253
- Tyson!
- How can I help?

20:02.504 --> 20:06.592
Jerry, I'm pregnant,
and I'm incapable of bullshit.

20:06.801 --> 20:08.469
Where is our offer?

20:08.719 --> 20:12.014
- Cronin's for lunch?
- This is Bob Sugar.

20:12.223 --> 20:13.766
- Knock.
- Pleasure.

20:14.392 --> 20:17.812
- You've called our house.
- Sorry to interrupt.

20:18.896 --> 20:23.819
I don't know what you do,
but my husband has an image.

20:24.069 --> 20:29.074
Putting him in a waterbed commercial?
You're making him common.

20:29.282 --> 20:34.037
He deserves the big four:
Shoe, car, clothing, soft drink.

20:34.287 --> 20:36.915
I know about the four
endorsement jewels.

20:37.666 --> 20:40.627
- Wow.
- He and I majored in marketing.

20:40.877 --> 20:42.003
We came to play!

20:42.921 --> 20:46.050
The dirty man is back!

20:49.011 --> 20:51.222
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

20:54.642 --> 20:56.227
You okay?

20:58.146 --> 21:02.483
- Fine. What's up?
- Came here to let you go.

21:03.819 --> 21:07.156
- Pardon me?
- Came here to fire you, Jerry.

21:12.661 --> 21:14.913
It's real.
You should say something.

21:23.213 --> 21:24.591
Shit.

21:26.509 --> 21:30.138
A crowded restaurant
so there won't be a scene.

21:40.231 --> 21:45.071
- You ungrateful...
- You need to see yourself.

21:45.321 --> 21:48.824
You said fewer clients,
you put it on paper.

21:49.075 --> 21:52.703
You know what I went through?
Fire my mentor?

21:52.912 --> 21:57.041
Carrying that for a week?
Could you get past yourself?

21:58.876 --> 22:00.669
- You'll lose.
- You want smaller.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.298
Now I want all my clients
and yours too.

22:05.759 --> 22:06.885
Whatever.

22:25.238 --> 22:27.573
Wendy, bring me my numbers.

22:42.964 --> 22:44.716
<i>- Cush.
- Cush, it's Sugar.</i>

22:44.967 --> 22:51.140
<i>Look, you're the most important guy
in sports. How does that feel?</i>

22:51.348 --> 22:55.394
I just wanna play football.
Dad, one of the agents.

22:55.602 --> 22:59.648
Wendy, Cushman's line is busy!
Call till you get through.

22:59.857 --> 23:01.734
And bring me my numbers!

23:01.942 --> 23:05.739
J.J., what's up?
Have you talked to Maguire?

23:05.989 --> 23:09.951
He had a meltdown.
I've talked to Doritos about you.

23:10.201 --> 23:12.620
They're interested. Talk to Rick.

23:12.871 --> 23:14.497
Martinez...

23:14.748 --> 23:18.585
Carlo, right now you
pay 25 percent to SMI.

23:18.835 --> 23:21.296
I'd cut my commission by 7 percent.

23:21.504 --> 23:25.176
I don't know if it was drugs,
but the guy freaked.

23:25.426 --> 23:29.430
Do you want him representing you?
How's your mom?

23:29.638 --> 23:32.641
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

23:32.892 --> 23:35.770
Just what does your heart tell you?

23:38.022 --> 23:39.398
Sorry to hear that.

23:44.403 --> 23:49.367
- Hey, what's going on?
- They've fired Jerry Maguire.

23:49.576 --> 23:53.497
SMI, this is Cleo. Hey!

23:58.335 --> 24:00.295
You're making a mistake.

24:00.545 --> 24:05.300
I'm concerned about your family
and your future.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.846
I have a long relationship with SMI.

24:09.055 --> 24:11.724
Does he know what it's like
to be black?

24:11.933 --> 24:14.394
Bob Sugar? He's...

24:14.644 --> 24:17.063
He's entertaining, funny.

24:17.313 --> 24:21.234
I don't know what it's like
to be black? I'm Mr. Black People!

24:21.442 --> 24:23.945
Don't make it harder than it is.

24:24.195 --> 24:28.575
I've got to be honest,
this is very distressing for me.

24:28.784 --> 24:32.746
Remember that stripper's name?
I do, it was April.

24:32.996 --> 24:38.377
That's my job. It's not about
the money, I do it all for you.

24:38.585 --> 24:42.965
- Still holding for Katarina.
- I'm talking about money.

24:43.173 --> 24:45.676
It's been a great day.

24:45.885 --> 24:49.013
Are you in or out? It's show business.

24:50.390 --> 24:52.100
You are in.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.522
- That's good.
- I wanna cry for what they did to you.

24:58.231 --> 25:02.902
<i>If it wasn't for the Acura deal,
you know I'd go with you.</i>

25:03.111 --> 25:07.742
Oh, Jerry. Oh, God!

25:09.577 --> 25:13.581
Call waiting.
Who could be calling me now?

25:13.789 --> 25:16.167
- Hi, Kathy Sanders.
- Still me.

25:20.755 --> 25:25.634
Kathy, why are you crying?
Oh. So you're in?

25:25.843 --> 25:28.805
Rod, Jerry Maguire. How are you doing?

25:29.055 --> 25:32.976
Jerry Maguire! How am I doing?

25:33.226 --> 25:36.646
I'll tell you.
I'm sweating my contract.

25:36.897 --> 25:40.692
Bob Sugar says
I'm missing out by being with you.

25:40.942 --> 25:45.113
<i>- That's how I'm doing.
- That's why I'm calling.</i>

25:45.322 --> 25:49.452
No, I hear that.
But do you truly hear what I'm saying?

25:49.660 --> 25:54.665
- I heard you say it, Daddy.
- The best thing is getting together.

25:54.916 --> 25:59.295
<i>- Would you mind holding?
- Didn't you say more attention?</i>

26:00.171 --> 26:05.593
- Didn't you tell my wife that?
- I said more personal attention.

26:05.802 --> 26:11.100
<i>Good! We're just getting started
on the things you need to know.</i>

26:11.308 --> 26:14.061
I will kill for you.
I will maim for you.

26:14.311 --> 26:17.398
I am a valuable commodity!

26:17.648 --> 26:23.070
I see a dude out to kill me,
I tell myself, "Catch the ball."

26:23.320 --> 26:26.156
Touchdown! I make miracles happen.

26:26.407 --> 26:28.201
Are you in or out?

26:28.410 --> 26:31.996
<i>I'm from Arizona.
I broke Arizona records.</i>

26:32.247 --> 26:35.458
I went to Arizona State!
I'm a Sun Devil!

26:35.667 --> 26:39.003
- And now you want Arizona dollars.
- Exactly.

26:39.254 --> 26:43.883
Jerry, I'm sitting here
with an ant problem. I got ants.

26:44.134 --> 26:46.594
My brother's room is flooded.

26:46.845 --> 26:49.932
<i>- Rod.
- We got a flood in his room.</i>

26:50.182 --> 26:51.725
Say hello to Maguire.

26:51.976 --> 26:54.562
- Hello, brother Maguire.
- Hello, Tee Pee.

26:54.770 --> 27:00.192
My house is falling apart!
Nobody's looking out for Rod Tidwell.

27:00.401 --> 27:03.946
And I'm supposed to be a superstar.

27:04.155 --> 27:06.449
I need a decision. In or out?

27:06.657 --> 27:10.370
You're gonna be so happy
you stayed with Bob Sugar!

27:10.620 --> 27:15.584
<i>I am a role model.
I have a family to support! Hear me?</i>

27:15.834 --> 27:18.503
I want my contract in Arizona!

27:18.754 --> 27:21.631
<i>But I like you. Yes, I like you.</i>

27:21.882 --> 27:25.802
My wife likes you.
You're good to my wife.

27:26.011 --> 27:29.140
- I will stay with you.
- That's great.

27:29.390 --> 27:30.641
<i>- Are you listening?
- Yes.</i>

27:30.850 --> 27:33.936
<i>That's what I'm gonna do for you.
God bless.</i>

27:34.145 --> 27:37.732
<i>This is what you'll do for me...
Are you listening?</i>

27:37.982 --> 27:41.903
What can I do for you?
Just tell me, what can I do?

27:42.153 --> 27:46.074
It's a very personal,
very important thing.

27:46.324 --> 27:48.035
It's a family motto.

27:48.243 --> 27:49.620
<i>- You ready?
- Ready.</i>

27:49.870 --> 27:51.914
<i>Making sure you are, brother.</i>

27:52.706 --> 27:54.166
Here it is:

27:56.043 --> 27:57.711
Show me the money.

28:00.047 --> 28:01.215
Show...

28:02.091 --> 28:05.344
<i>... me the...</i>

28:05.552 --> 28:07.346
...money!

28:08.348 --> 28:10.433
Doesn't that make you feel good?

28:10.892 --> 28:14.395
<i>- Say it with me, Jerry.
- Show you the money.</i>

28:14.646 --> 28:17.816
You can do better than that! Say it!

28:18.024 --> 28:22.153
<i>- Bob Sugar's on the other line.
- Show you the money.</i>

28:22.362 --> 28:26.825
<i>- No, not you, show me the money.
- Show me the money.</i>

28:27.075 --> 28:29.078
- Louder!
- Show me the money.

28:29.286 --> 28:32.123
<i>- You got to yell!
- Show me the money!</i>

28:32.331 --> 28:36.001
<i>- I need to feel you.
- Show me the money!</i>

28:36.210 --> 28:38.838
Show me the money!

28:39.380 --> 28:42.716
Show me the money!

28:42.925 --> 28:46.178
- You love this black man.
- I love the black man!

28:46.387 --> 28:49.516
- Show me the money!
- I love black people!

28:49.724 --> 28:51.393
I love black people!

28:51.643 --> 28:55.355
- Who's your motherfucker?
- You're my motherfucker!

28:55.564 --> 28:59.860
- What you gonna do, Jerry?
- Show me the money!

29:00.485 --> 29:02.863
Congratulations,
you're still my agent.

29:33.228 --> 29:36.899
Well, don't worry.

29:38.692 --> 29:41.278
I won't do what you think I will...

29:41.528 --> 29:43.572
...which is just flip out!

29:48.368 --> 29:51.706
Let me just say...

29:52.165 --> 29:56.377
...as I ease out
of the office I helped build.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.339
I'm sorry, but it's a fact...

29:59.589 --> 30:03.802
...that there's such a thing
as manners.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.764
A way of treating people.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.478
These fish have manners.

30:12.728 --> 30:15.356
These fish have manners.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.485
In fact, I'm starting a new company...

30:19.735 --> 30:22.696
...and the fish will come with me.

30:22.947 --> 30:25.908
Call me sentimental...

30:26.117 --> 30:29.121
...but the fish are coming with me.

30:38.505 --> 30:40.090
Okay.

30:43.218 --> 30:47.389
If anybody else
wants to come with me...

30:47.639 --> 30:50.768
...this will be a moment
of something...

30:51.018 --> 30:54.188
...real and fun and inspiring...

30:54.397 --> 30:57.191
...in this godforsaken business...

30:57.442 --> 30:59.944
...and we will do it together.

31:02.655 --> 31:04.490
Who's coming with me?

31:04.741 --> 31:06.367
Who's coming with me?

31:07.368 --> 31:09.496
Who's coming with me?!

31:13.333 --> 31:17.254
Who's coming with me
besides Flipper here?

31:23.802 --> 31:25.888
This is embarrassing.

31:31.144 --> 31:32.645
All right.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.690
Wendy.

31:36.107 --> 31:38.818
- Shall we?
- Oh, Jerry...

31:39.027 --> 31:42.405
...I'm three months away
from the pay increase.

31:47.202 --> 31:48.495
Okay.

31:49.329 --> 31:50.998
Okay.

31:58.631 --> 32:01.300
I will go with you.

32:01.926 --> 32:04.762
Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

32:11.728 --> 32:13.730
Right now?

32:15.982 --> 32:17.901
Don't do it.

32:24.032 --> 32:25.826
Bye.

32:34.877 --> 32:38.965
We'll see you all again.
Sleep tight.

32:41.008 --> 32:43.761
Let's see how they do without us.

32:57.443 --> 32:58.986
Thank you.

33:00.112 --> 33:03.031
You will have
a medical program, right?

33:03.282 --> 33:05.659
Sure, yes, medical.

33:06.827 --> 33:08.579
I don't know.

33:09.872 --> 33:13.710
When you think about
what you did, don't panic.

33:13.960 --> 33:16.171
We're gonna be great.

33:16.421 --> 33:20.049
We're gonna be great!

33:53.126 --> 33:55.295
I wonder what he said.

33:55.670 --> 33:58.340
My favourite aunt is hearing-impaired.

33:58.590 --> 34:01.927
He just said, "You complete me."

34:23.491 --> 34:27.745
That's a good point.
We come to support each other...

34:27.995 --> 34:30.790
...but we don't listen to one another.

34:30.998 --> 34:35.546
Women are taught not to
see each other as good people.

34:35.754 --> 34:39.925
We see each other as enemies.
We compete over men, jobs...

34:40.175 --> 34:45.264
- It's true, we compete.
- I used to really hate women.

34:45.472 --> 34:49.643
And then I met you guys,
and you're like me.

34:49.852 --> 34:53.565
It's important because
I know you can be my friends.

34:54.190 --> 34:57.026
- What about medical?
- Of course.

34:57.277 --> 34:59.737
A single mother can't be frivolous.

34:59.988 --> 35:05.326
If you read what he wrote, you'd have
left too. And there are other jobs.

35:05.535 --> 35:09.539
- Do you know the cost of child exams?
- Yes, $150.

35:09.748 --> 35:11.584
And that's when he's well.

35:11.792 --> 35:15.504
- Where is Ray?
- Asleep in the living room.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.757
Next time you lecture me...

35:18.007 --> 35:22.428
...don't leave my boy alone
with that divorced women's group.

35:22.636 --> 35:26.849
So I finally, finally
got in touch with my anger.

35:36.026 --> 35:38.320
What did I do?

35:39.738 --> 35:43.325
Function, function.
Forward motion is everything.

35:43.533 --> 35:46.036
Cush saves all.

35:46.286 --> 35:50.707
You go to Texas. Keep one superstar,
and they'll all follow.

35:50.957 --> 35:52.585
There's no loyalty.

35:52.835 --> 35:56.130
The first person
who told me that was you.

35:56.339 --> 36:00.051
- I was trying to sleep with you.
- Well, it worked.

36:00.301 --> 36:05.473
And I will not let you fail.
You are Jerry Ma-fucking-guire!

36:05.681 --> 36:08.476
- That's right.
- King of the house calls!

36:08.726 --> 36:11.604
- Master of the living room.
- Okay, okay.

36:11.854 --> 36:16.318
- Okay, this is working.
- You are not a loser.

36:18.278 --> 36:23.575
- Who said anything about "loser"?
- Mistake. Wrong word! Let's leave.

36:52.648 --> 36:55.484
I'm in the back den, Jerry.

36:56.902 --> 36:59.697
- Would you like a bloody beer?
- I'm fine.

36:59.947 --> 37:02.158
Beer and tomato juice.

37:02.783 --> 37:04.243
I'm fine.

37:04.618 --> 37:07.288
We've spent a lot
of time together, Matt.

37:07.538 --> 37:10.082
You know I care about you
and your son.

37:10.332 --> 37:14.337
You know I'm a straight shooter.
If you stay with SMI...

37:14.546 --> 37:17.466
We decided to stay with you.

37:24.473 --> 37:26.600
I'm not really a hugger.

37:27.434 --> 37:29.311
I can't let go.

37:29.519 --> 37:34.609
I told myself, " If he shows up,
we stick with him."

37:36.277 --> 37:39.697
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Cush.

37:39.906 --> 37:41.699
How are you?

37:42.533 --> 37:44.660
- You remember Keith?
- Yeah.

37:44.869 --> 37:49.415
I want him to go number one
in the draft, and I want him to play.

37:49.624 --> 37:53.212
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.
He'll go first.

37:53.420 --> 37:55.672
I'll either surf or ski.

37:55.923 --> 37:59.510
- Denver's where he should be.
- I'll give it everything.

37:59.718 --> 38:04.640
You know I don't do contracts,
but what you do have is my word.

38:06.391 --> 38:08.894
And it's stronger than oak.

38:59.614 --> 39:02.701
- Hello.
- Dorothy? Jerry Maguire.

39:02.909 --> 39:07.372
- Is Avery there?
- She had an NFL meeting in Atlanta.

39:10.542 --> 39:12.961
- Jerry.
- Hello? Hello?

39:13.211 --> 39:16.966
Sorry, that was my son and the nanny.

39:17.175 --> 39:21.929
<i>- They're in our office?
- Nanny? I prefer child technician.</i>

39:22.138 --> 39:26.893
I had the calls transferred
to my house so I could work here.

39:27.101 --> 39:29.604
<i>That's fine. Dorothy, we are back.</i>

39:29.812 --> 39:32.982
We are so very, very back.

39:33.232 --> 39:35.319
I re-signed Cush. We're set.

39:35.527 --> 39:38.989
- I am so happy for you.
- Happy for us.

39:39.239 --> 39:42.493
Happy for us. Okay, happy for us.

39:42.826 --> 39:45.370
Rod, being at the draft is good.

39:45.579 --> 39:49.875
No, Rod, just get on the plane
and meet us at the gate.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.753
<i>- Good. See you there.
- God bless.</i>

39:53.003 --> 39:56.424
Avery will meet you
at the B-gate at 4: 15.

39:56.674 --> 40:00.595
Do you know the human head
weighs eight pounds?

40:01.721 --> 40:07.143
Did you know Troy Aikman, in six
years, has passed for 16,303 yards?

40:08.144 --> 40:13.108
- Bees and dogs can smell fear.
- I booked Tidwell at the Marriott.

40:13.358 --> 40:15.736
- Does he smoke?
- I don't know.

40:15.986 --> 40:21.325
Did you know Pete Rose has 4256 hits
and he's not in the Hall of Fame?

40:21.575 --> 40:25.830
Do you know that my neighbour
has three rabbits?

40:27.581 --> 40:29.708
I can't compete with that.

40:31.460 --> 40:34.339
- So did we go over everything? Yes?
- Yep.

40:34.589 --> 40:38.009
- Back on Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

40:40.345 --> 40:43.181
Ray, have fun at school. Wish me luck.

40:43.390 --> 40:45.517
Luck!

41:04.745 --> 41:08.040
- Hey, Rod.
- Hey, Jerry...

41:09.917 --> 41:12.628
Cush, how are you, man?

41:12.837 --> 41:15.674
Jerry, we should be selling these.

41:15.924 --> 41:19.428
This is my agent,
you might want his autograph.

41:19.636 --> 41:21.346
My hand's getting tired.

41:21.555 --> 41:24.433
- Excuse me.
- What's happening?

41:24.641 --> 41:26.435
Are you Hootie?

41:26.685 --> 41:30.689
No, I am not Hootie.

41:35.987 --> 41:39.115
What it's gonna be,
San Diego or Denver?

41:39.574 --> 41:41.242
I'll surf or ski.

41:45.371 --> 41:47.665
He'll either surf or ski.

41:54.839 --> 41:59.053
Rod, at last I find you.

41:59.261 --> 42:03.307
Why am I here? It's like I'm
five years late for the prom.

42:03.516 --> 42:08.729
- Nobody gives a damn about me.
- Let's walk through this lobby.

42:08.938 --> 42:14.360
I want all the media and player reps
to see you for what you are:

42:14.568 --> 42:17.614
The best-kept secret in the NFL.

42:18.782 --> 42:23.787
The most commanding wide receiver.
You're fast, fierce, charismatic.

42:23.995 --> 42:26.832
You're the man.
You are the man! Ready?

42:27.040 --> 42:27.916
Let's go.

42:28.083 --> 42:29.793
Let's walk.

42:30.919 --> 42:34.005
The fiercest. You are the man.

42:34.214 --> 42:38.636
- Let's do it.
- Hi, Mel. Hi, Tom.

42:38.886 --> 42:40.054
Where's Cush?

42:40.304 --> 42:44.308
Good thing you held onto Cushman.
San Diego or Denver?

42:44.559 --> 42:49.981
I want you to meet Rod Tidwell,
110 catches, 1550 yards last year.

43:08.709 --> 43:13.547
Now I wanna talk about Rod Tidwell.
A fierce receiver.

43:24.142 --> 43:27.771
I came all that way
just to walk the lobby.

43:28.354 --> 43:30.106
It might have even worked.

43:30.356 --> 43:34.027
Yeah? Let's do that shit again.

43:36.030 --> 43:40.534
Shooting a Reebok ad down there.
Where are my endorsements?

43:40.743 --> 43:45.122
I didn't get no love from Chevy,
no love from Pepsi.

43:45.372 --> 43:48.918
I didn't get no love from
that Energizer Bunny or Nike.

43:49.168 --> 43:51.879
Obviously, I didn't get
love from Reebok.

43:52.129 --> 43:56.468
- Did I tell you my Reebok story?
- I gotta get back to Cush.

43:56.718 --> 44:01.973
Oh, your golden paycheck.
But wait, I'll boil it down for you.

44:02.182 --> 44:03.892
Fuck Reebok!

44:04.142 --> 44:06.978
All they do is ignore me.
Always have.

44:07.229 --> 44:09.064
Always have.

44:09.481 --> 44:14.277
You know what was great down there?
You unloaded that large chip...

44:14.486 --> 44:16.154
...on your shoulder.

44:16.405 --> 44:18.866
And you let people in.

44:20.451 --> 44:22.328
You were brilliant.

44:23.454 --> 44:24.831
- Brilliant?
- Brilliant.

44:25.081 --> 44:28.584
- Really?
- Take care, I'll see you tomorrow.

44:28.835 --> 44:32.713
- You love me now?
- I'm about showing you the money!

44:32.964 --> 44:36.927
I was just testing you,
but to hear you say that...

44:37.177 --> 44:40.514
...makes me love you, baby.
You know?

44:40.722 --> 44:42.850
Jerry, come back!

44:46.311 --> 44:48.105
- How was your flight?
- Good.

44:48.355 --> 44:50.399
- What size are you?
- 12 and a half.

44:50.607 --> 44:54.278
Grab a couple pairs
of them new shoes by the door.

45:01.703 --> 45:05.582
Cush, Matt, we have
a decision to make.

45:06.958 --> 45:11.546
San Diego just came in with
a last-minute scenario. It's big.

45:11.796 --> 45:13.715
He's got to go number one.

45:13.923 --> 45:18.721
San Diego wants to trade up
with Denver. They want him bad.

45:18.929 --> 45:23.309
- What about Denver?
- This stuff happens before a draft.

45:23.517 --> 45:24.977
San Diego, Matt...

45:25.227 --> 45:29.857
...they're offering seven years
for 30. Signing bonus of 8.

45:30.065 --> 45:33.736
- Should I unplug the phone?
- Reporters keep calling.

45:33.944 --> 45:37.365
You just be friendly
and say, "No comment."

45:38.283 --> 45:41.369
I'm no good at talking
and saying nothing.

45:43.079 --> 45:45.332
Well, let me...

45:45.582 --> 45:49.628
For you, it's a pleasure.
This is Cush.

45:51.087 --> 45:54.800
<i>It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?
Sniff if he is.</i>

45:55.008 --> 45:58.554
Remember, you're in
with the big boys now.

45:58.763 --> 46:02.809
<i>Let your dad talk,
and know that I got you the deal.</i>

46:03.059 --> 46:06.562
<i>This is business, not friendship.
Be strong...</i>

46:06.813 --> 46:09.148
<i>... because you're global now.</i>

46:09.357 --> 46:13.277
Okay, buddy? See you later.

46:17.699 --> 46:19.243
No comment.

46:26.208 --> 46:29.044
- He's got it wrong.
- You're on TV again.

46:29.294 --> 46:32.005
I'm sick of me, already.

46:43.935 --> 46:48.648
Before I go back to Denver,
we should put something on paper.

46:48.898 --> 46:51.442
Something that says you're with me.

46:51.693 --> 46:54.112
Not right now, Jerry.

47:00.327 --> 47:03.998
Do I know everything
there is to know here, Matt?

47:07.460 --> 47:10.713
You're not talking
with Bob Sugar, are you?

47:11.338 --> 47:15.092
Apparently, Denver would only
deal with him.

47:15.926 --> 47:18.805
Said who? Sugar?

47:19.764 --> 47:21.224
I'm learning as I go.

47:21.808 --> 47:26.980
So you empowered him
to deal with Denver behind my back?

47:27.272 --> 47:29.316
I'm sorry...

47:31.026 --> 47:34.154
- I love my son.
- I love your son!

47:34.863 --> 47:39.410
I brought Denver to 20 million.
They always deal with me.

47:39.660 --> 47:43.831
You listened to Sugar.
Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child.

47:44.040 --> 47:47.752
You let that snake in the door?

47:50.463 --> 47:55.843
Listen, rookie mistake.
I'll fix this Denver thing for you.

47:56.093 --> 47:59.139
You didn't sign anything
with Sugar, right?

48:01.517 --> 48:05.979
Matt? Tell me you didn't sign.

48:07.022 --> 48:09.733
Because I'm still sort of
moved by your...

48:09.983 --> 48:13.904
..."my word is stronger
than oak" thing.

48:15.572 --> 48:18.450
We signed an hour ago.

48:19.327 --> 48:23.206
You were in the lobby
with the black fella.

48:26.084 --> 48:29.754
Sorry, Jerry.
I just want to play football.

48:32.757 --> 48:37.387
- What do I do? How do I spin it?
- Honey, it's spun.

48:37.595 --> 48:40.015
What did I do to you?

48:40.266 --> 48:42.059
It's all about you, isn't it?

48:42.268 --> 48:47.314
"Soothe me, save me, love me."
I have to finish my job.

48:47.565 --> 48:49.567
Everything's on the run.

48:49.817 --> 48:53.362
You and I are sales people.
We sell.

48:53.571 --> 48:57.366
It's not "Love me"
or "Trust my handshake"...

48:57.616 --> 49:00.704
...it's " Make the sale!
Get it signed."

49:00.912 --> 49:03.582
Jump right into my nightmare.

49:03.790 --> 49:06.209
So now I can't be honest?

49:06.418 --> 49:11.465
- I'd prefer loyalty.
- What'd we say when we got together?

49:11.673 --> 49:13.592
Brutal truth. Remember?

49:14.468 --> 49:16.970
I think you added the "brutal."

49:17.220 --> 49:22.602
There's a sensitivity thing that some
people have. I don't have it.

49:22.852 --> 49:25.980
I don't cry at movies,
or gush over babies...

49:26.230 --> 49:28.191
...I don't do Christmas early...

49:28.441 --> 49:32.069
...and I don't tell a man who
screwed up our lives:

49:32.278 --> 49:35.948
"Oh, poor baby."
That's me, for better or worse.

49:36.199 --> 49:37.992
But I do love you.

49:42.039 --> 49:45.459
- Avery, it's over.
- I didn't hear it.

49:46.418 --> 49:50.005
- Something is missing.
- You've never been alone.

49:50.214 --> 49:52.132
- Listen.
- You can't be alone.

49:52.341 --> 49:55.010
It's over.

49:57.971 --> 50:00.850
No one has ever dumped me.

50:02.018 --> 50:04.187
I'm not trying to make history.

50:05.063 --> 50:08.650
I climbed to the top of El Capitan...

50:08.900 --> 50:13.154
...in 18 hours and 23 minutes.
I can make this work.

50:16.157 --> 50:17.992
No.

50:18.868 --> 50:21.122
Oh, Jerry.

50:29.672 --> 50:32.383
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

50:41.977 --> 50:47.399
I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
I'm too strong for you. Loser!

50:52.737 --> 50:56.074
Roll with the punches.
Tomorrow's another day.

50:57.826 --> 50:59.286
Taxi!

50:59.703 --> 51:02.206
You're loving me now, aren't you?

51:02.915 --> 51:05.585
Very much. Taxi!

51:05.835 --> 51:09.297
Is it my imagination?
Didn't we arrive in a limo?

51:09.505 --> 51:14.927
<i>The question is... I hope I don't
sound like a shrink here, but...</i>

51:15.803 --> 51:20.726
<i>... what's wrong?
- Man, I'm just a big disappointment.</i>

51:20.934 --> 51:25.272
Jerry, everybody cries on this show.

51:25.689 --> 51:28.358
If you tested positive,
quit doing blow.

51:28.901 --> 51:34.323
Upset about your baby? Why'd you leave
her mother? I knew her, she's okay.

51:34.531 --> 51:39.620
<i>The media don't understand
the pressures $54 million comes with.</i>

51:39.870 --> 51:44.542
- This is some bullshit.
- What are you doing with me, Rod?

51:45.210 --> 51:50.381
- What?
- Don't you even see? I'm finished.

51:50.840 --> 51:53.510
I am fucked!

51:53.843 --> 51:56.846
Twenty-four hours ago I was hot!

51:57.055 --> 51:58.723
Now...

51:59.390 --> 52:01.477
...I'm a cautionary tale.

52:01.727 --> 52:07.149
I don't need this jacket,
because I'm cloaked in failure!

52:07.399 --> 52:10.569
I lost him the night before the draft.

52:10.778 --> 52:12.738
Why? Let's recap.

52:12.947 --> 52:17.576
Because a hockey player's kid
made me feel superficial.

52:17.785 --> 52:21.915
I ate some bad pizza, went to bed
and grew a conscience!

52:22.332 --> 52:26.586
Well, boo-fucking-hoo!

52:28.880 --> 52:31.299
I got a shelf life of 10 years.

52:31.550 --> 52:36.805
My next contract has to bring
the dollars that'll last a long time.

52:37.055 --> 52:39.474
I'm done in five years.

52:39.724 --> 52:42.103
What's my family gonna live on?

52:42.395 --> 52:45.356
Huh? What you get me.

52:45.606 --> 52:47.567
So I won't hear your shit.

52:47.817 --> 52:52.738
"Oh, I lost Cush and Avery..."

52:52.989 --> 52:55.575
Could I have another drink, please?

52:55.825 --> 52:58.828
Anybody else would have
left you by now...

52:59.078 --> 53:02.416
...but I'm sticking with you.
I said I would.

53:02.666 --> 53:06.503
If I gotta ride your ass,
you gonna show me the money.

53:06.753 --> 53:09.214
You gonna show me the money.

53:11.758 --> 53:16.305
We together on this. You know
what I'm saying? We gonna be one.

53:18.265 --> 53:21.018
The both of us! You know?!

53:21.269 --> 53:23.605
Oh, my God.

53:27.817 --> 53:30.695
<i>You have no messages.</i>

53:56.555 --> 54:01.435
He's coming. He just lost his
best client. I invited the guy over.

54:01.645 --> 54:07.067
This is not a guy. It's a syndrome.
"Early midlife, hanging by a thread...

54:07.275 --> 54:12.155
...I can't be alone, I'll call
my long-suffering assistant" syndrome.

54:12.364 --> 54:16.785
- But if that's what you want...
- Honey, he's engaged.

54:17.035 --> 54:21.540
And for the first time,
I'm part of something I believe in.

54:22.041 --> 54:24.961
Okay. But he better not
be good-looking!

54:31.217 --> 54:32.927
I'm Jerry Maguire.

54:34.220 --> 54:38.850
Hello. You're just the way
I pictured you.

54:39.142 --> 54:43.272
- I'm her disapproving sister, Laurel.
- Honesty.

54:44.022 --> 54:45.065
Thank you.

54:47.484 --> 54:50.112
Thank you. Dorothy!

54:53.240 --> 54:56.994
Dorothy, your boss is here.

54:57.494 --> 54:58.871
Hello.

55:03.042 --> 55:04.544
Hey, you.

55:04.752 --> 55:07.422
- Thanks for inviting me over.
- Sure.

55:07.672 --> 55:11.176
Where's the little guy?

55:11.426 --> 55:13.219
- He's sleeping.
- Sleeping.

55:15.513 --> 55:20.935
I'm so glad you're home.
That alone thing is not my specialty.

55:21.853 --> 55:22.938
Oh, my God!

55:27.735 --> 55:30.362
Well, I broke up with Avery.

55:36.076 --> 55:40.915
- Gosh, you know, that's too bad.
- No, it's better...

55:41.165 --> 55:45.795
...because we'll still be friends.
It's better now than later.

55:48.882 --> 55:52.469
- I'm dying here, aren't I?
- It's a really bad cut.

55:52.677 --> 55:56.014
Just think if I got her
the ring she really wanted.

56:02.103 --> 56:04.357
Why don't you have a seat?

56:07.109 --> 56:11.030
I'll get some aloe vera for the cut.

56:11.697 --> 56:14.617
- Do you have something to drink?
- Sure.

56:20.832 --> 56:21.874
I heard.

56:22.083 --> 56:26.255
No kidding. I saw the shadow
of curious shoes under the door.

56:26.463 --> 56:30.634
He'd go home with a gardening tool
if it showed interest.

56:31.552 --> 56:33.846
Use the frosted glasses.

56:34.096 --> 56:35.848
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

56:36.056 --> 56:40.060
- I warmed up some chicken.
- That's the girl I love!

56:40.310 --> 56:44.858
I'll only say this: You've always
been responsible with Ray.

56:45.108 --> 56:48.778
He shouldn't hear
a strange man's voice here.

56:48.987 --> 56:52.949
- Some drunken stranger.
- As opposed to 10 angry women?

56:54.617 --> 56:57.579
Lean forward. Okay, I've got it.

56:57.829 --> 57:00.665
It's still edible. Change your shirt.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.216
Hi, Jerry.

57:10.968 --> 57:15.931
Hi, Ray. Aren't you
supposed to be in bed?

57:16.140 --> 57:17.391
Yeah.

57:18.476 --> 57:22.521
Don't worry, I won't tell.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.943
The human head weighs eight pounds.

57:37.954 --> 57:40.832
- Jerry Maguire.
- I think it's this one.

57:43.418 --> 57:48.216
<i>You should dream about me.
I should be on your mind constantly.</i>

57:48.424 --> 57:52.553
<i>That's when the dollars will flow.
The kwan will appear.</i>

57:52.762 --> 57:56.808
- Who is this?
- Who is this? This is the Rod Tidwell.

57:57.058 --> 57:59.310
I need to speak with my agent.

57:59.519 --> 58:02.605
- We should be one.
- You a football player?

58:03.105 --> 58:07.402
<i>A football player? I'm a teacher
about to whomp your ass!</i>

58:07.611 --> 58:09.321
Put Jerry on the phone!

58:09.530 --> 58:13.075
You just can't fall
for some drowning man.

58:13.325 --> 58:15.118
- Be practical.
- Practical?

58:15.327 --> 58:18.914
Turtleneck, sensible.
V-neck, sexy. Turtleneck.

58:19.122 --> 58:23.962
Don't say that. What are other women
my age doing right now?

58:24.170 --> 58:27.549
They're out partying,
trying to get a man.

58:27.757 --> 58:31.803
Trying to keep a man.
Not me, I'm trying to raise a man.

58:32.178 --> 58:37.600
This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day
reminder of Roger for my whole life.

58:37.809 --> 58:42.272
- I've had three lovers in four years.
- That's not bad.

58:42.522 --> 58:47.194
All of them ran a distant second
to a good book and a warm bath.

58:47.403 --> 58:51.615
Look at me. I'm the oldest
26-year-old in the world.

58:51.866 --> 58:53.951
- Now, how do I look?
- Good.

58:54.618 --> 58:55.995
Yeah? Thanks.

58:56.203 --> 59:00.666
<i>72%% % of new buyers are
African-American. That's what I am.</i>

59:00.875 --> 59:05.213
- You talk too much.
- Talking is primitive communication.

59:05.422 --> 59:08.758
<i>- It was fun talking to you. Bye.
- Jerry...!</i>

59:09.718 --> 59:13.388
- I'll make a ham sandwich.
- I wanna say one thing.

59:13.597 --> 59:17.726
- You do listen to me.
- Well, I love you. Mayo?

59:17.976 --> 59:20.729
- Repression, as a religion.

59:20.937 --> 59:25.026
When my daddy retired from
the United Way after 38 years...

59:25.276 --> 59:30.239
...he said, " I wish they'd given me
a more comfortable chair."

59:30.490 --> 59:32.116
And then my dad died.

59:32.366 --> 59:36.746
My mom took me to the zoo,
and I loved the zoo. And...

59:36.954 --> 59:38.080
Wait.

59:38.372 --> 59:43.127
- I want to tell you more about my dad.
- No, let's go to the zoo.

59:46.507 --> 59:47.925
You're right.

59:48.217 --> 59:52.554
It's just my whole life,
I've been trying to talk.

59:52.804 --> 59:55.265
I mean, really talk.

59:55.516 --> 59:59.353
But no one wants to listen.
You know that feeling?

59:59.561 --> 1:00:03.607
- They just look at you...
- Let's go to the zoo, right now.

1:00:03.816 --> 1:00:08.571
The zoo, you know...
The fucking zoo's closed.

1:00:11.533 --> 1:00:13.576
You said "fuck."

1:00:14.702 --> 1:00:16.704
Yeah, I did.

1:00:17.205 --> 1:00:19.457
- Is that...?
- I won't tell.

1:00:22.418 --> 1:00:27.341
Well, then I'm gonna
have to take you to the zoo.

1:00:28.759 --> 1:00:33.639
- I gotta go to bed, my mom's coming.
- Oh, wait...

1:00:34.849 --> 1:00:37.685
I hear my mom. I gotta go to bed.

1:00:38.227 --> 1:00:41.105
- Thanks for listening.
- Sure.

1:00:43.023 --> 1:00:47.571
Okay. Drinks, food,
and I called you a cab.

1:00:50.115 --> 1:00:53.952
- Good idea.
- Quiet, I have a little boy asleep.

1:00:56.204 --> 1:00:57.247
Right.

1:00:58.165 --> 1:00:59.207
Our company.

1:01:03.461 --> 1:01:08.426
Look. A little...
A little speech before I go.

1:01:13.723 --> 1:01:18.561
Do not worry about your future.

1:01:18.895 --> 1:01:23.858
You and your son,
we, are just fine.

1:01:24.108 --> 1:01:25.944
You still have a job.

1:01:26.528 --> 1:01:31.575
But let me tell you something
about Jerry Maguire, okay?

1:01:31.825 --> 1:01:35.996
You come after me, and you will lose.

1:01:36.747 --> 1:01:41.418
No, because I am a survivor.
I'm a survivor!

1:01:42.085 --> 1:01:47.509
Dorothy Boyd, you are
with the Lord of the Living Room.

1:01:47.842 --> 1:01:50.803
The King of the Kingdom!

1:01:51.054 --> 1:01:53.264
And I am...

1:01:57.310 --> 1:01:58.394
...drunk.

1:02:07.947 --> 1:02:09.740
We meet again.

1:02:24.213 --> 1:02:25.256
Here.

1:02:35.350 --> 1:02:36.852
Truth?

1:02:38.603 --> 1:02:43.316
- Sure.
- I care about the job, of course.

1:02:43.525 --> 1:02:46.946
But mostly,
I just want to be inspired.

1:02:49.031 --> 1:02:52.493
- Me too.
- What you wrote inspired me.

1:02:55.788 --> 1:02:59.208
I'm working with you
because of that memo.

1:03:01.002 --> 1:03:02.879
I loved that memo.

1:03:06.758 --> 1:03:08.802
It's a mission statement.

1:03:22.316 --> 1:03:23.775
Well...

1:03:24.401 --> 1:03:27.113
Sorry about the hand.

1:03:31.075 --> 1:03:33.786
You know that feeling?

1:03:34.078 --> 1:03:37.749
You're not completely
embarrassed yet...

1:03:37.999 --> 1:03:41.169
...but you glimpse
tomorrow's embarrassment?

1:03:41.377 --> 1:03:44.422
Don't worry about it, boss.

1:03:45.089 --> 1:03:47.301
Oh, shit. You said "boss."

1:03:47.510 --> 1:03:50.930
- Yeah, I did.
- Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

1:03:51.138 --> 1:03:55.643
- No, don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
- I do. I feel like him.

1:03:55.851 --> 1:04:00.564
- I'm, like, harassing you right now.
- Well, I may not sue.

1:04:13.453 --> 1:04:15.831
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1:04:18.875 --> 1:04:21.878
Look, don't worry, okay?
I mean, don't...

1:04:24.130 --> 1:04:27.885
We'll be okay because
I am gonna take my one client...

1:04:29.428 --> 1:04:32.181
...and we are gonna go all the way.

1:04:33.850 --> 1:04:37.478
Because, hey...
I'm back.

1:04:39.856 --> 1:04:42.191
Don't worry.

1:04:57.499 --> 1:05:01.795
- Way to go, Rod. Good catch.
- You can't...

1:05:03.088 --> 1:05:05.132
All right, good job.

1:05:08.094 --> 1:05:13.141
- Gotta talk about his contract, Dennis.
- Meet me at The Crocodile, 8:00.

1:05:14.184 --> 1:05:15.560
You bet.

1:05:35.581 --> 1:05:36.874
Thank you.

1:05:37.082 --> 1:05:40.836
<i>Tell me you got lost.
I thought I was your friend.</i>

1:05:41.045 --> 1:05:45.382
<i>- Something came up.
- Okay. $10 million for four years.</i>

1:05:45.591 --> 1:05:48.720
<i>- You're dreaming.
- Ten for four. It's a deal.</i>

1:05:50.388 --> 1:05:55.060
- He's got an attitude problem.
- He listens to me. I can help you.

1:05:55.268 --> 1:05:59.731
- He's a shrimp.
- He broke all the records last year.

1:05:59.940 --> 1:06:03.985
I want a prototypical
wide receiver who's 6'3", 220.

1:06:04.194 --> 1:06:07.447
<i>Not some guy who's 5'10" and bitches.</i>

1:06:07.656 --> 1:06:11.035
Dennis, I'm asking you...

1:06:12.703 --> 1:06:13.788
...for a favour.

1:06:14.455 --> 1:06:19.627
<i>I introduced you to your wife.
We've spent Christmases together.</i>

1:06:19.836 --> 1:06:23.965
<i>- Holiday cheer.
- Jerry, you're reaching.</i>

1:06:24.173 --> 1:06:28.804
I'm asking for a favour.
Don't do this to me. We have history.

1:06:29.012 --> 1:06:33.851
We got history, all right.
You drove the prices up for years.

1:06:34.059 --> 1:06:39.481
- It's your turn at the end of the line.
- Dennis, don't...

1:06:44.069 --> 1:06:48.575
I talked with Dennis Wilburn
about your renegotiation.

1:06:52.912 --> 1:06:54.205
Talking?

1:06:54.664 --> 1:07:00.086
Jerry Rice, Andre Reed, Chris Carter.
I smoked all these fools!

1:07:01.171 --> 1:07:03.882
Yet they're making the big dollars.

1:07:04.132 --> 1:07:08.804
They are making the kwan.
And you're talking.

1:07:12.183 --> 1:07:15.978
- Kwan? That's your word?
- Hell yeah, that's my word.

1:07:16.187 --> 1:07:20.149
Some dudes might have coin,
but they'll never have kwan.

1:07:20.357 --> 1:07:21.483
What is...?

1:07:21.692 --> 1:07:27.114
It means love, respect, community
and dollars. The entire package.

1:07:29.284 --> 1:07:30.327
The kwan.

1:07:31.411 --> 1:07:32.579
Great word.

1:07:34.664 --> 1:07:37.584
- Towel?
- No, I air-dry.

1:07:39.127 --> 1:07:44.549
Listen, Rod. I say this
with great respect for you.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:49.597
But those players you mentioned
are marquee players.

1:07:51.265 --> 1:07:55.186
- And this deal where, you know, we...
- Marquee?

1:07:55.394 --> 1:07:59.065
This is a renegotiation.
We want more from them.

1:07:59.273 --> 1:08:02.735
Show them your pure joy of the game.

1:08:02.944 --> 1:08:05.780
Bury the attitude a bit,
and show them...

1:08:06.030 --> 1:08:07.406
Wait.

1:08:07.823 --> 1:08:11.578
- You're telling me to dance.
- No. I'm saying...

1:08:12.287 --> 1:08:16.250
...to get back to the guy
who first started playing.

1:08:16.458 --> 1:08:21.380
Way back when you were a kid, it
wasn't just about the money, was it?

1:08:22.256 --> 1:08:23.674
Was it?

1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:25.926
Was it?

1:08:28.095 --> 1:08:31.641
Do your job.
Don't you tell me to dance!

1:08:31.891 --> 1:08:33.685
- Fine.
- Hey. Hey!

1:08:33.893 --> 1:08:35.603
I am an athlete.

1:08:35.854 --> 1:08:38.273
- I am not an entertainer!
- Fine!

1:08:38.481 --> 1:08:43.903
I do not dance, and I do not start
pre-season without a contract!

1:08:44.445 --> 1:08:48.116
- Fine, fine, fine!
- Jerry, talk to me.

1:08:49.284 --> 1:08:52.037
Breathe! Breathe, Jerry.

1:08:54.540 --> 1:08:56.959
I am out here for you.

1:08:57.751 --> 1:09:00.838
You don't know
what it's like to be me.

1:09:01.046 --> 1:09:05.176
It is an up-at-dawn,
pride-swallowing siege...

1:09:05.384 --> 1:09:09.138
...that I will never fully
tell you about, okay?!

1:09:12.475 --> 1:09:13.935
God. Help me!

1:09:15.061 --> 1:09:18.106
Help me, Rod. Help me help you.

1:09:19.399 --> 1:09:23.069
Help me help you.

1:09:23.737 --> 1:09:26.656
Help me help you.

1:09:33.581 --> 1:09:35.208
I'm sorry.

1:09:36.334 --> 1:09:40.421
You are hanging on
by a very thin thread.

1:09:41.464 --> 1:09:43.549
And I dig that about you!

1:09:45.426 --> 1:09:49.639
No contract? I'll help me,
I'll help you, help everybody!

1:09:50.057 --> 1:09:54.561
- That's my man.
- Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

1:09:54.770 --> 1:09:57.064
Help me! Help me!

1:09:58.732 --> 1:10:02.945
- See you in Los Angeles.
- Jerry. Come on, man.

1:10:03.403 --> 1:10:06.198
See, that's the difference between us.

1:10:06.406 --> 1:10:10.202
You think we're fighting.
I think we're talking.

1:10:14.916 --> 1:10:19.045
Unless you love everybody,
you can't sell anybody.

1:10:28.972 --> 1:10:33.894
Dennis Wilburn is faxing his offer
for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

1:10:34.103 --> 1:10:37.940
- He said you'd be happy... Glad.
- He say happy or glad?

1:10:39.483 --> 1:10:42.319
Glad. He said glad. Glad.

1:10:43.487 --> 1:10:48.158
- Glad is good.
- We could sure use that commission.

1:10:48.367 --> 1:10:52.372
Here. I did a rundown
on where you stand financially.

1:10:55.667 --> 1:11:00.505
- My condo was devalued.
- You don't have to explain.

1:11:01.214 --> 1:11:04.801
The other night, I wanna apologize.

1:11:05.010 --> 1:11:06.970
What happened there?

1:11:07.179 --> 1:11:10.432
We're coworkers.
We can't have atmosphere.

1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:13.060
I'm very relieved you said that.

1:11:13.269 --> 1:11:16.606
You know, the other night,
I was lonely.

1:11:16.814 --> 1:11:19.150
I felt you understood something.

1:11:20.151 --> 1:11:22.987
We've got a company to think about.

1:11:23.196 --> 1:11:26.240
I'll never take advantage
of you again.

1:11:26.657 --> 1:11:29.827
- Good.
- You walked out on a job for me.

1:11:30.077 --> 1:11:32.080
Can this be right?

1:11:33.081 --> 1:11:34.249
Exactly.

1:11:35.626 --> 1:11:39.546
I know you need to be alone
with your thoughts.

1:11:39.755 --> 1:11:42.883
Think about what's wrong
and how to fix it.

1:11:43.133 --> 1:11:45.761
And, you know, just be alone.

1:11:46.345 --> 1:11:48.055
Alone.

1:11:54.062 --> 1:11:57.732
- You wanna go out to dinner?
- I know a great place.

1:11:57.941 --> 1:12:02.445
I broke up with that loser,
and then he started stalking me.

1:12:02.654 --> 1:12:07.033
- What do you mean by stalking?
- Coming over uninvited.

1:12:07.534 --> 1:12:12.248
"Coming over uninvited"?
So Romeo on your balcony is a stalker?

1:12:23.092 --> 1:12:25.386
Excuse me. Ladies?

1:12:26.762 --> 1:12:31.433
Good evening,
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

1:12:31.935 --> 1:12:36.648
- She's in the kitchen.
- Laurel. Hello.

1:12:37.983 --> 1:12:42.445
- Where are you taking her tonight?
- You're the nanny?

1:12:43.405 --> 1:12:45.824
- Au pair.
- Au pair? I see.

1:12:51.454 --> 1:12:52.623
He likes you.

1:12:54.292 --> 1:12:57.378
My goodness.
I've got some gifts for you.

1:12:58.421 --> 1:13:01.883
Do you like presents?
Good, all right.

1:13:02.592 --> 1:13:06.554
Arizona Cardinals.
It's the team Rod plays for.

1:13:06.762 --> 1:13:10.266
- Dropping your laundry off?
- Want a Steelers hat?

1:13:10.474 --> 1:13:13.020
- For me?
- I got some things.

1:13:13.228 --> 1:13:15.772
- I've got it in gray too.
- Thanks.

1:13:16.023 --> 1:13:19.693
You're very welcome.
Look what I've got here.

1:13:19.902 --> 1:13:23.155
An energy bar.
It'll keep you up all night.

1:13:23.363 --> 1:13:27.701
That's not a good idea.
Aunt Laurel will eat that.

1:13:30.662 --> 1:13:33.374
It looks like you've got a fan.

1:13:35.501 --> 1:13:39.589
That's more than a dress,
that's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

1:13:39.797 --> 1:13:44.010
I got revved up at the thought
of an evening among adults.

1:13:44.219 --> 1:13:47.222
- No offence, buddy.
- Jerry, you meet Chad?

1:13:47.430 --> 1:13:50.683
Am I dressed okay? I didn't realize...

1:13:55.064 --> 1:13:57.399
Don't let him stay up too late.

1:13:57.608 --> 1:14:02.071
Tonight, I'm gonna teach
Ray about jazz.

1:14:02.279 --> 1:14:04.532
That'll put him to sleep early.

1:14:06.242 --> 1:14:08.077
I want to go too.

1:14:08.285 --> 1:14:13.625
No, sweetheart, you stay here
with Chad and be good. Kiss me.

1:14:14.626 --> 1:14:16.127
Let's go.

1:14:18.547 --> 1:14:20.173
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:14:20.382 --> 1:14:22.384
Give me a hug.

1:15:04.469 --> 1:15:07.639
- I'll meet you at the car.
- Okay.

1:15:07.890 --> 1:15:09.892
You forgot your keys.

1:15:10.100 --> 1:15:14.355
I've never seen him kiss a man
just like a dad!

1:15:14.814 --> 1:15:19.194
Wasn't that thrilling?
He must have been needing that.

1:15:19.402 --> 1:15:23.907
Don't cry at the start of a date.
Cry at the end, like I do.

1:15:25.074 --> 1:15:28.286
Don't be a shoulder
for him to cry on either.

1:15:28.578 --> 1:15:31.206
- Keys.
- Oh, keys.

1:15:32.665 --> 1:15:34.335
Oh, dear.

1:15:59.945 --> 1:16:03.740
Ever since you've met me, I've been...

1:16:08.662 --> 1:16:13.083
It was laziness, my breakup
with Avery. You know that saying?

1:16:13.291 --> 1:16:17.964
"It's nobody's fault." It's a lie.
Somebody is always to blame.

1:16:18.172 --> 1:16:22.176
You go for it like you do a job.
You work at it.

1:16:22.385 --> 1:16:26.597
But maybe love shouldn't be
such hard work.

1:16:27.807 --> 1:16:30.017
Yeah, maybe so.

1:16:31.143 --> 1:16:36.066
But it's not every day
you say goodbye to a woman like that.

1:16:38.318 --> 1:16:41.572
- A song for the lovers?
- No, thank you.

1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:47.202
- No, no, we work together.
- This is like an office meeting.

1:16:47.995 --> 1:16:50.038
But I know what you mean.

1:16:50.622 --> 1:16:56.045
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger
was any good, even before...

1:16:58.548 --> 1:17:00.258
Before?

1:17:02.218 --> 1:17:04.554
- Jerry?
- What?

1:17:05.471 --> 1:17:08.600
Let's not tell our sad stories.

1:17:13.271 --> 1:17:16.775
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

1:17:46.181 --> 1:17:49.851
They sting. Let Chad
catch the bee in the glass.

1:17:50.060 --> 1:17:55.107
He won't hurt him. You've got such
a good heart, buddy. I love you.

1:18:23.428 --> 1:18:26.807
Well, this would be good night.

1:18:27.474 --> 1:18:28.892
Good night.

1:18:29.810 --> 1:18:32.646
I'll see you tomorrow.
It's a big day.

1:18:59.008 --> 1:19:00.092
Good night.

1:19:01.844 --> 1:19:03.304
Good night.

1:19:35.463 --> 1:19:36.505
Oops.

1:19:41.135 --> 1:19:45.014
- Let me fix this.
- Good idea.

1:20:39.530 --> 1:20:42.157
I think you should not come in.

1:20:43.701 --> 1:20:46.328
Or come in.

1:20:48.622 --> 1:20:53.627
- Depending on how you feel.
- The same to you.

1:20:56.214 --> 1:20:58.425
I have to go in.

1:20:59.759 --> 1:21:01.761
I live here.

1:21:09.728 --> 1:21:11.146
Right.

1:21:15.817 --> 1:21:17.403
I'll come in.

1:21:19.655 --> 1:21:21.365
Good.

1:21:30.291 --> 1:21:33.044
Are you sure we want to do this?

1:21:37.174 --> 1:21:39.092
Oh, hell, yes.

1:21:48.769 --> 1:21:52.105
- Did he have a good night?
- Yeah, he's asleep.

1:21:52.314 --> 1:21:56.401
- How did it go with sport-boy?
- Still going.

1:21:57.946 --> 1:22:00.031
All right.

1:22:05.036 --> 1:22:06.621
How are you?

1:22:09.332 --> 1:22:10.708
Treat her right.

1:22:15.255 --> 1:22:17.049
She's great.

1:22:21.470 --> 1:22:26.725
I know this might be a bit awkward,
but I want you to use this.

1:22:27.476 --> 1:22:29.395
No, look.
God...

1:22:31.105 --> 1:22:35.943
This is Miles Davis and John Coltrane.

1:22:36.485 --> 1:22:39.030
Stockholm 1963.

1:22:39.614 --> 1:22:44.119
Two masters of freedom, playing
before their art was corrupted...

1:22:44.327 --> 1:22:47.205
...by cocktail-lounge performers...

1:22:47.414 --> 1:22:52.836
...who destroyed the legacy
of the only American art form:

1:22:54.629 --> 1:22:56.423
Jazz.

1:22:57.884 --> 1:23:00.636
I've put some Mingus on there too.

1:23:08.227 --> 1:23:13.441
- No barriers, no boundaries.
- Chad, I got it.

1:23:46.726 --> 1:23:48.186
Come here.

1:24:06.914 --> 1:24:10.292
You know this is gonna
change everything.

1:24:13.504 --> 1:24:15.089
Promise?

1:24:21.221 --> 1:24:23.848
What is this music?

1:24:57.967 --> 1:25:01.722
I love getting up in the morning!
I clap and say:

1:25:01.930 --> 1:25:03.724
"This will be a great day!"

1:25:06.602 --> 1:25:10.480
Great!
Did you really need to do this?

1:25:23.536 --> 1:25:26.205
I'm getting him up, so don't worry.

1:25:26.581 --> 1:25:30.168
What? I'm just waiting for coffee.
I don't care.

1:25:30.793 --> 1:25:33.421
- Just tell me one thing.
- No.

1:25:36.925 --> 1:25:38.134
- Why...?
- I'm worried...

1:25:38.343 --> 1:25:43.766
...you'll believe in a guy who may not
have an emotional marble in his head.

1:25:43.974 --> 1:25:46.602
- Please, if I start talking...
- You "please."

1:25:46.810 --> 1:25:50.064
What am I for taking the opportunity?

1:25:50.272 --> 1:25:55.569
- This guy's on the bottom rung.
- Maybe I am taking advantage.

1:25:55.778 --> 1:25:58.949
Does that make me a bad person? Huh?

1:25:59.157 --> 1:26:04.579
I found someone popular and charming
and not so nice to me, and he died.

1:26:04.871 --> 1:26:07.040
Why should I let this guy go...

1:26:07.249 --> 1:26:11.962
...when everything in my body
says that this one is the one?

1:26:12.170 --> 1:26:15.298
Take it easy.
I just wanted a few fun details.

1:26:16.508 --> 1:26:18.552
Why didn't you say so?

1:26:19.053 --> 1:26:23.349
Well, you might be interested
in this one little detail.

1:26:23.558 --> 1:26:26.060
I was just about to tell you...

1:26:27.687 --> 1:26:30.022
...that I love him.

1:26:31.315 --> 1:26:35.736
I do! I love him,
and I don't care what you think.

1:26:35.945 --> 1:26:39.031
I love him for the man
he wants to be...

1:26:39.283 --> 1:26:42.452
...and for the man that he almost is.

1:26:42.661 --> 1:26:45.872
I love him, Laurel. I love him.

1:26:46.123 --> 1:26:49.626
- I love him!
- Hi, Jerry.

1:26:52.212 --> 1:26:53.839
Act natural.

1:26:59.429 --> 1:27:02.765
- Tell me he's not there.
- He's not there.

1:27:03.016 --> 1:27:04.851
Oh, God.

1:27:05.101 --> 1:27:08.187
- Easy, ladies, easy.
- Coffee?

1:27:09.105 --> 1:27:13.401
No, thanks. We bottom-feeders
prefer cereal first.

1:27:14.027 --> 1:27:18.615
- Let's have Apple Jacks.
- Apple Jacks it is.

1:27:21.201 --> 1:27:22.995
Good morning, darling.

1:27:25.748 --> 1:27:26.916
Morning.

1:27:27.458 --> 1:27:29.835
- What's going on?
- A lot, actually.

1:27:30.044 --> 1:27:33.881
We've got a big fax today.
We need this commission.

1:27:34.256 --> 1:27:36.342
Need this commission. Milk?

1:27:38.677 --> 1:27:40.305
Cheers.

1:27:47.437 --> 1:27:50.523
That was really great
of you this morning.

1:27:51.566 --> 1:27:56.613
Let's just root for a big offer
so we can move out of this room...

1:27:56.863 --> 1:27:59.282
...into a real office.

1:27:59.491 --> 1:28:02.203
Would you mind? Thanks a lot.

1:28:10.628 --> 1:28:12.213
Shit.

1:28:18.094 --> 1:28:22.266
1.7 for three years?
Man, we owe more than that!

1:28:22.474 --> 1:28:25.394
This is the game.
I'll get back to them.

1:28:25.602 --> 1:28:29.398
And say what? " Please remove
your dick from my ass"?

1:28:29.606 --> 1:28:32.943
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little pregnant right now.

1:28:33.151 --> 1:28:38.282
- I feel like crying.
- Let's not take this emotionally.

1:28:38.490 --> 1:28:42.704
- We'll roll with the problem.
- Why are you so calm?

1:28:42.912 --> 1:28:46.583
Roll with this problem?
Don't take it emotionally?

1:28:46.791 --> 1:28:50.128
You haven't gotten emotional
enough over him!

1:28:50.336 --> 1:28:53.339
- Get me Bob Sugar on the phone.
- Marcee...

1:28:56.175 --> 1:29:00.931
- You wanna leave me?
- A lot of agents say a lot of shit.

1:29:01.140 --> 1:29:03.183
What do you stand for?!

1:29:03.392 --> 1:29:08.564
How about integrity?
There's so much greed in the world...

1:29:08.772 --> 1:29:11.734
...I don't know what to tell my son!

1:29:11.942 --> 1:29:15.279
This guy isn't yelling,
"Show me the money!"

1:29:15.487 --> 1:29:20.492
Do you know he's broke
and working for you for free?

1:29:21.536 --> 1:29:24.789
Broke! Broke, broke, broke.

1:29:25.415 --> 1:29:29.961
- I'm not as good at insults as she is.
- That was pretty good.

1:29:30.170 --> 1:29:32.088
No shit.

1:29:33.381 --> 1:29:35.842
Let me show you something.

1:29:39.429 --> 1:29:44.185
- Here. Rod, read this.
- No, no, no, no.

1:29:44.685 --> 1:29:48.564
I just think that...
I think it's important.

1:29:48.981 --> 1:29:51.234
I appreciate this, but...

1:29:51.442 --> 1:29:54.820
You should be proud.
They should read it.

1:29:55.529 --> 1:30:00.785
Tell me what to do. Tell me to eat
lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

1:30:01.912 --> 1:30:04.831
You say this is the best,
all we can get...

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:08.418
- All we can get?
- I'm talking with my agent.

1:30:08.627 --> 1:30:14.049
This is what you're gonna do. You're
gonna reject that shitty contract.

1:30:14.508 --> 1:30:19.930
Play out your existing shitty contract,
and next year, you're a free agent.

1:30:20.764 --> 1:30:26.104
Baby, this is us. You and me.
We determine our worth.

1:30:26.396 --> 1:30:28.690
You are a strong, proud...

1:30:28.898 --> 1:30:32.569
...surviving, splendid black man.

1:30:35.154 --> 1:30:36.573
Marcee...

1:30:37.699 --> 1:30:39.867
...you are the shit.

1:30:43.038 --> 1:30:44.873
Oh, baby.

1:30:47.418 --> 1:30:52.548
- If you get injured, you get zero.
- Won't happen. I'm strong in mind.

1:30:56.010 --> 1:31:00.848
- It's a risk.
- You bet on me, like I bet on you.

1:31:07.105 --> 1:31:10.108
You know? My man!

1:31:13.653 --> 1:31:15.822
You know, baby?

1:31:17.365 --> 1:31:21.161
- You're so crazy.
- I love you, baby.

1:31:22.496 --> 1:31:25.291
- Let me kiss that head.
- Thank you.

1:31:34.091 --> 1:31:38.679
- I'm taking that job in San Diego.
- Don't talk about that yet.

1:31:39.013 --> 1:31:44.436
- You can't afford me.
- I'll find something fast for Tidwell.

1:31:44.770 --> 1:31:48.565
- I refuse to be a drain.
- We'll stay afloat.

1:31:48.774 --> 1:31:53.237
We'll stay afloat. Don't leave.

1:31:53.445 --> 1:31:57.241
- Get on the camel.
- You've been on my ass all day.

1:31:57.449 --> 1:32:00.244
- He's my client.
- Get him on the camel.

1:32:00.452 --> 1:32:03.164
- I will.
- We don't need a camel.

1:32:03.373 --> 1:32:07.752
- It's Camel Chevrolet.
- You see that? That's how I feel.

1:32:07.961 --> 1:32:10.964
- He's feeling my pain!
- Get on the camel!

1:32:11.172 --> 1:32:16.094
- I'm pulling him from this.
- It's okay. Just get rid of the camel.

1:32:16.302 --> 1:32:19.973
- This isn't what I had in mind.
- You're pulling him?

1:32:20.181 --> 1:32:22.058
Right, let's bounce.

1:32:22.977 --> 1:32:27.314
Pulling him? Then you shouldn't
have begged me to hire him.

1:32:28.190 --> 1:32:32.570
I know you needed that commission,
but we won't get Reebok...

1:32:32.778 --> 1:32:35.614
...with no regional Camel ad.
Excuse me.

1:32:35.906 --> 1:32:41.036
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Are we gonna be friends now?

1:32:41.287 --> 1:32:46.251
- What do you know about single moms?
- I was raised by one.

1:32:46.459 --> 1:32:51.840
Tell me. Because after this, she'll
have to take that job in San Diego.

1:32:52.048 --> 1:32:56.344
First of all, single mothers
don't date. Watch yourself.

1:32:56.553 --> 1:33:01.057
They've been to the circus.
You know what I mean?

1:33:01.266 --> 1:33:05.062
They've been to the puppet show
and seen the strings.

1:33:05.271 --> 1:33:07.815
- You love her?
- How do I know?

1:33:08.024 --> 1:33:10.234
You know when you know.

1:33:10.443 --> 1:33:15.156
I don't want her to go. I've been
hanging out at her place a lot.

1:33:15.364 --> 1:33:19.327
That right there is bullshit!
You gotta be fair to her.

1:33:19.535 --> 1:33:24.041
Single mothers are a sacred thing.
You gotta have the talk.

1:33:25.876 --> 1:33:30.881
She loves you. If you don't love her,
you have got to tell her.

1:33:33.842 --> 1:33:37.554
The kid's amazing. He...

1:33:39.973 --> 1:33:42.559
I feel you. I feel you, dog.

1:33:42.768 --> 1:33:47.357
But a real man wouldn't shoplift
the pootie from a single mother.

1:33:48.483 --> 1:33:51.653
I didn't shoplift the pootie.

1:33:56.950 --> 1:34:01.371
All right. I shoplifted the pootie.

1:34:10.214 --> 1:34:15.135
You know, John Coltrane
once said to Miles Davis...

1:34:15.803 --> 1:34:20.891
When you say goodbye to him, just
be cool. What's meant to be will be.

1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:26.439
You'll see each other. I'm losing
the only person who listens to me.

1:34:26.648 --> 1:34:30.277
- Quit making me laugh.
- You're doing the right thing.

1:34:30.485 --> 1:34:33.947
Start your life.
Don't cushion the fall for him.

1:34:34.155 --> 1:34:37.409
Check out Exhibit A on the front lawn.

1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:42.831
- I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.
- Goodbye.

1:34:43.039 --> 1:34:44.917
All right. Goodbye.

1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:49.505
Bye.

1:34:56.429 --> 1:35:00.141
Listen, you're gonna
like it in San Diego.

1:35:04.646 --> 1:35:08.942
It's gonna be great there.
You'll make a lot of friends.

1:35:09.818 --> 1:35:14.323
- I'm gonna see you this weekend.
- Go ahead and go.

1:35:19.703 --> 1:35:22.039
Go ahead and go.

1:35:32.926 --> 1:35:37.055
- Sure you're okay to drive this?
- This rig? No problem.

1:35:37.263 --> 1:35:42.310
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

1:35:42.518 --> 1:35:47.191
I'll see you in a couple of days,
and I love you.

1:35:48.525 --> 1:35:50.611
I love you too.

1:35:52.279 --> 1:35:54.114
- What?
- Nothing.

1:35:54.615 --> 1:35:56.659
I'll see you soon.

1:35:57.576 --> 1:36:02.164
Look, if this weekend
should turn into next month...

1:36:02.373 --> 1:36:07.754
...and next month turns into whenever,
don't make a joke of your life.

1:36:07.963 --> 1:36:11.091
Go back and read what you wrote.

1:36:11.299 --> 1:36:16.721
You're better than the Bob Sugars.
Don't forget that.

1:36:33.990 --> 1:36:37.702
- Wait! Wait a second.
- No, no! Oh, God.

1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:44.417
- We can save on medical, rent...
- Don't listen to him.

1:36:44.626 --> 1:36:48.380
What if we stay together?
What if we got married?

1:36:49.715 --> 1:36:55.137
- If I said that, would you stay?
- Don't do that. Don't say that unless...

1:36:55.387 --> 1:36:58.599
Well, say it if you want to.

1:37:04.021 --> 1:37:05.481
Will you marry me?

1:37:11.904 --> 1:37:13.615
What are you thinking?

1:37:48.318 --> 1:37:50.528
We're getting married.

1:37:51.571 --> 1:37:56.409
Do you, Jerry Maguire,
take this woman to be your wife?

1:37:56.826 --> 1:37:57.869
Not yet.

1:37:58.078 --> 1:38:03.500
And do you, Dorothy Boyd,
take this man to be your husband?

1:38:04.668 --> 1:38:05.795
Almost.

1:38:06.003 --> 1:38:08.547
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1:38:08.798 --> 1:38:11.217
- Okay, sweetie.
- Oh, yeah.

1:38:50.216 --> 1:38:52.093
I should go.

1:38:54.554 --> 1:38:57.932
Come on, brother. Talk to me, brother.

1:39:11.488 --> 1:39:13.365
We did it.

1:39:14.783 --> 1:39:16.493
We sure did.

1:39:36.139 --> 1:39:38.725
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

1:39:45.231 --> 1:39:47.568
I'm glad we had this talk.

1:39:49.737 --> 1:39:51.822
Oh, look at them.

1:39:54.533 --> 1:39:57.370
She is so beautiful.

1:40:13.220 --> 1:40:16.556
I do not believe
they have this on tape.

1:40:17.849 --> 1:40:20.102
Hey, that's my bro.

1:40:23.313 --> 1:40:26.985
See, now I'm gonna
release this to ESPN.

1:40:28.820 --> 1:40:34.075
- You think I'm joking.
- No, it's okay. I know where you live.

1:40:36.786 --> 1:40:39.706
You didn't have the talk, did you?

1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:43.668
No.

1:40:45.086 --> 1:40:48.257
Well, this definitely
was another way to go.

1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:53.137
Hey, Dorothy, come here.

1:40:53.345 --> 1:40:57.016
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Maguire.

1:40:57.641 --> 1:41:00.352
We're gonna have a great season!

1:41:09.112 --> 1:41:11.531
Scotty, Tidwell did four for 36.

1:41:14.743 --> 1:41:16.578
- Jerry.
- Dennis.

1:41:16.828 --> 1:41:19.205
- He's having a good game. So far.
- He is.

1:41:19.623 --> 1:41:21.833
You're gonna miss him next year.

1:41:22.042 --> 1:41:25.003
<i>Loser.</i>

1:41:27.423 --> 1:41:31.302
<i>I've got a great team behind me
and I'm loving it.</i>

1:41:38.100 --> 1:41:39.810
That's my mo'fo!

1:41:41.270 --> 1:41:42.313
Come here.

1:41:44.231 --> 1:41:49.279
Why don't you be the first man
in your family not to use that word?

1:41:49.529 --> 1:41:53.533
And we'll let you live.
Now go kiss Daddy, quick.

1:41:56.578 --> 1:41:57.663
Come on, now!

1:41:58.622 --> 1:42:00.832
Come on, Rod!

1:42:04.044 --> 1:42:07.047
I saw you limping
after the first quarter.

1:42:07.256 --> 1:42:08.967
Yeah, I...

1:42:11.427 --> 1:42:15.431
I sprained my ankle on the ice
out there. It was cold.

1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:17.141
All right. Thanks.

1:42:17.350 --> 1:42:22.063
That went well.
Anybody else worth talking to? No.

1:42:22.272 --> 1:42:23.982
Let's get out of here.

1:42:25.566 --> 1:42:28.362
- How's your head?
- Bubblicious.

1:42:29.697 --> 1:42:31.824
- How are you?
- Hey, Rod.

1:42:32.032 --> 1:42:35.160
- How you doing, man?
- Hanging in there.

1:42:38.580 --> 1:42:42.918
That quarterback sucks.
He's gonna get me killed.

1:42:43.127 --> 1:42:46.630
He's throwing high
and across the middle.

1:42:46.839 --> 1:42:50.635
My brain's blown because
you weren't asshole enough...

1:42:50.844 --> 1:42:54.014
...to get me my 10 million
three months ago.

1:42:56.349 --> 1:43:00.895
Take care of yourself on that field.
You're my entire client roster.

1:43:01.104 --> 1:43:05.317
Don't I know this.
Now go home to your wife.

1:43:05.525 --> 1:43:08.487
- What's that mean?
- What are you doing here?

1:43:08.696 --> 1:43:13.200
- You could've told me on the phone.
- How about personal attention?

1:43:13.409 --> 1:43:16.829
- You don't want to go home.
- What are you saying?

1:43:17.038 --> 1:43:21.417
I'm just trying to talk to you.
How's your marriage?

1:43:21.626 --> 1:43:24.670
The husband and wife thing,
how is that?

1:43:32.054 --> 1:43:36.767
- Not everyone has what you have.
- Why did you get married?

1:43:37.601 --> 1:43:41.563
- I'm just asking as a friend.
- You want an answer?

1:43:41.855 --> 1:43:43.440
Loyalty.

1:43:44.524 --> 1:43:46.151
She was loyal.

1:43:50.698 --> 1:43:55.119
I mean, you know,
everything grew from there.

1:43:55.536 --> 1:43:57.455
It just...

1:43:58.498 --> 1:44:00.124
...grew from there.

1:44:01.417 --> 1:44:05.546
- That's an answer.
- That's the answer.

1:44:05.838 --> 1:44:10.594
It's not sexy. Shit!
But that's an answer.

1:44:10.803 --> 1:44:15.349
"Tell him what he's won, Bob."
"A beautiful marriage!"

1:44:15.724 --> 1:44:17.351
Shit!

1:44:17.601 --> 1:44:22.439
Well, I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, Rod.

1:44:25.776 --> 1:44:27.903
I have a question for you.

1:44:28.153 --> 1:44:30.156
- Are we really friends?
- Why not?

1:44:30.407 --> 1:44:35.370
Friends can tell each other anything
if we have our friends hats on, right?

1:44:35.578 --> 1:44:37.205
- I think so.
- All right.

1:44:38.498 --> 1:44:41.626
Here's why you don't
have your $10 million.

1:44:41.835 --> 1:44:46.715
You're a paycheck player. You play
with your head, not your heart.

1:44:46.923 --> 1:44:49.218
In your personal life? Heart.

1:44:49.427 --> 1:44:52.805
On the field,
it's about what you didn't get.

1:44:53.180 --> 1:44:55.433
Who's to blame, who underthrew...

1:44:55.641 --> 1:44:59.854
...who has the contract you don't,
who's not giving you love!

1:45:00.062 --> 1:45:05.067
That is not what inspires people!
That is not what inspires people!

1:45:05.276 --> 1:45:09.323
Just shut up!
Play the game from your heart.

1:45:09.531 --> 1:45:13.827
Then I'll show you the kwan.
And that's the truth!

1:45:14.036 --> 1:45:18.957
Can you handle it? It's just
a question from a friend. You know?

1:45:21.168 --> 1:45:24.880
When they call you shrimp,
I'm the one who defends you!

1:45:25.130 --> 1:45:27.924
- I don't wanna be friends no more.
- Fine.

1:45:28.133 --> 1:45:31.554
Quit using that word "kwan."
That's my word!

1:45:31.763 --> 1:45:34.432
- I'll see you in L.A.
- No heart?!

1:45:35.558 --> 1:45:38.353
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

1:46:16.101 --> 1:46:20.855
- How many concussions has he had?
- I can't get no respect.

1:46:21.064 --> 1:46:23.024
I'm making miracles happen.

1:46:41.419 --> 1:46:45.756
I went to see this so-called
black film the other day.

1:46:46.215 --> 1:46:49.468
No more salt.
Your biggest game is coming up.

1:46:49.677 --> 1:46:53.432
<i>I don't want you dehydrated
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1:46:55.559 --> 1:47:00.856
Twenty minutes of coming attractions.
All black films, all violent.

1:47:01.064 --> 1:47:06.236
- Brothers shooting brothers.
- I hate you seeing movies alone.

1:47:06.445 --> 1:47:10.742
- Baby.
- My Pisces queen.

1:47:13.328 --> 1:47:15.830
I hate seeing movies without you.

1:47:18.750 --> 1:47:21.586
I won't do it anymore, okay?

1:47:31.013 --> 1:47:33.474
- Baby.
- Baby!

1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:39.188
- Now?
- Baby now!

1:47:40.856 --> 1:47:44.818
- Ray, it's time to go.
- You got them?

1:47:45.027 --> 1:47:47.863
Do you take Visa? Take it!

1:47:49.239 --> 1:47:51.493
What were you thinking tonight...

1:47:51.701 --> 1:47:56.665
...watching them go through
the entire human emotional experience?

1:47:56.915 --> 1:47:59.876
"I hope he doesn't get injured."

1:48:02.087 --> 1:48:03.838
I felt responsible.

1:48:05.548 --> 1:48:10.178
Sometimes I can't tell at all
what's going on in your head.

1:48:16.269 --> 1:48:19.563
And I don't know your noises yet.

1:48:20.398 --> 1:48:25.820
- Well, when you wonder, ask me.
- Okay, I will.

1:48:27.154 --> 1:48:29.365
I thought I just did.

1:48:34.579 --> 1:48:37.416
- Why do you love me?
- Why do you love me?

1:48:38.709 --> 1:48:40.544
Can I come and watch TV?

1:48:40.919 --> 1:48:43.547
- In just a minute.
- For a few minutes.

1:49:02.900 --> 1:49:05.028
<i>Hang in there.
He's not going anywhere.</i>

1:49:05.653 --> 1:49:07.113
I know.

1:49:07.780 --> 1:49:11.493
- Can we talk about something else?
- I don't think so.

1:49:11.702 --> 1:49:16.707
I'm incapable of small talk.
But that's why you love me, right?

1:49:30.137 --> 1:49:33.642
I'm about personal attention.
This is my life.

1:49:33.892 --> 1:49:36.561
I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

1:49:36.811 --> 1:49:40.774
<i>I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1:49:40.982 --> 1:49:44.527
I can be in Indiana
by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

1:49:44.736 --> 1:49:46.738
Just give me 20 minutes.

1:49:47.364 --> 1:49:50.283
I'm not asking for an answer now.

1:49:50.492 --> 1:49:54.664
I'll call you tomorrow.
Just enjoy your day. Tell Doug hi.

1:49:55.164 --> 1:49:58.459
All right, thank you.
Same to you, Marilee.

1:50:01.796 --> 1:50:05.508
Indiana, Tuesday. I'll be there.

1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:11.013
It's my fault.

1:50:13.642 --> 1:50:14.851
What?

1:50:15.060 --> 1:50:18.021
It's not fair to you,
this whole thing.

1:50:21.733 --> 1:50:23.026
Come here.

1:50:24.278 --> 1:50:27.197
Tell me. Let me help.

1:50:27.656 --> 1:50:31.535
I took advantage of you.
Worst of all, I'm not alone.

1:50:31.743 --> 1:50:34.289
I did this with a kid.

1:50:34.539 --> 1:50:39.627
I was just on some wild ride
where I thought that...

1:50:39.877 --> 1:50:44.507
...I was in love enough
for both of us.

1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:48.553
I pretended your proposal was real...

1:50:48.761 --> 1:50:52.015
...when it might have been
a hypothetical.

1:50:54.601 --> 1:50:56.603
I did this.

1:50:57.021 --> 1:51:00.357
At least I can do something
about it now.

1:51:01.233 --> 1:51:03.944
I'm not a guy who runs.

1:51:04.194 --> 1:51:05.988
I stick.

1:51:08.115 --> 1:51:11.201
Well, I don't need you to stick.

1:51:11.785 --> 1:51:14.873
What do you want?
My soul or something?

1:51:15.081 --> 1:51:20.503
- Why not? I deserve that.
- What if I'm not built that way?

1:51:22.881 --> 1:51:26.843
- I think we made a mistake.
- What if it's true?

1:51:29.179 --> 1:51:32.516
"Great at friendship,
bad at intimacy."

1:51:32.725 --> 1:51:36.687
It's the theme of my bachelor film,
for God's sake.

1:51:36.896 --> 1:51:41.692
I know, I watched it.
I sort of know it by heart.

1:51:45.154 --> 1:51:48.532
- I don't like to give up.
- Please.

1:51:50.159 --> 1:51:55.207
My need to make the best of things,
and your need to be responsible...

1:51:55.415 --> 1:52:00.212
If we don't say something about
it now, we could lose 10 years...

1:52:00.420 --> 1:52:02.297
...being polite.

1:52:04.299 --> 1:52:08.971
Let's just call this next road trip
what it really is:

1:52:10.180 --> 1:52:12.516
A nice long break.

1:52:20.942 --> 1:52:22.735
What about Ray?

1:52:26.656 --> 1:52:29.200
Well, you'll be friends.

1:52:30.326 --> 1:52:31.911
Friends?

1:52:36.500 --> 1:52:40.921
- Of course you'll be friends.
- I'll take him to the zoo.

1:52:45.134 --> 1:52:48.220
So this break is a breakup? That's...

1:52:48.429 --> 1:52:52.975
Come on, Jerry.
You know this isn't easy for me.

1:52:53.893 --> 1:52:56.730
On the surface,
everything looks fine.

1:52:57.605 --> 1:53:00.692
I've got this great guy.

1:53:01.526 --> 1:53:04.446
And he loves my kid.

1:53:06.781 --> 1:53:09.659
And he sure does like me a lot.

1:53:16.208 --> 1:53:19.045
And I can't live like that.

1:53:22.048 --> 1:53:24.884
It's not how I'm built.

1:53:57.502 --> 1:54:02.215
If this is empty,
this doesn't matter.

1:54:24.321 --> 1:54:26.824
It was just a mission statement.

1:54:42.841 --> 1:54:44.968
Put your arms up, please.

1:54:58.941 --> 1:55:03.029
Hey, buddy. I wondered
where you were. How's it going?

1:55:03.321 --> 1:55:05.197
Get out of here. Go.

1:55:07.867 --> 1:55:11.245
- Where's your agent?
- I don't know.

1:55:11.829 --> 1:55:16.543
You belong with the big boys.
You belong with the big money.

1:55:16.752 --> 1:55:21.131
- You're fucking Rod Tidwell!
- Get away from my guy.

1:55:21.340 --> 1:55:25.469
- I was just telling...
- Just go. Flee.

1:55:25.677 --> 1:55:30.015
This is a nice moment for you.
I'm gonna let you have it.

1:55:32.142 --> 1:55:35.188
Give me a call, Rod.
Say hi to Marcee.

1:55:42.945 --> 1:55:45.782
- Thanks for coming.
- I missed you.

1:55:48.409 --> 1:55:52.121
What can I say?
You're all I've got.

1:55:54.415 --> 1:55:59.838
Frank Gifford with Al Michaels and
Dan Dierdorf at the Sun Devil Stadium.

1:56:00.089 --> 1:56:04.635
<i>The story is the Cardinals
are still alive for a playoff spot.</i>

1:56:04.843 --> 1:56:09.598
<i>The reason for that is
the outstanding play of Rod Tidwell.</i>

1:56:09.807 --> 1:56:11.892
<i>We'll talk about that too.</i>

1:56:12.101 --> 1:56:15.730
The Dallas Cowboys
know they're in the playoffs.

1:56:15.939 --> 1:56:18.984
<i>Going for a consecutive Super Bowl.</i>

1:56:19.401 --> 1:56:22.696
If Arizona wins tonight
and next week...

1:56:22.904 --> 1:56:28.326
<i>... they'll make the playoffs
for the first time in 21 years.</i>

1:56:29.077 --> 1:56:32.747
<i>Better not mess up
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1:56:33.290 --> 1:56:37.503
What did I say? He's always
nervous for televised games.

1:56:37.712 --> 1:56:42.508
<i>The Cowboys continue their mission
on Monday Night Football.</i>

1:56:50.057 --> 1:56:52.393
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi, good game.

1:56:52.643 --> 1:56:55.731
- Great column this morning.
- Thanks.

1:57:01.153 --> 1:57:02.529
Fuck you, punk!

1:57:09.786 --> 1:57:12.164
It's a real bruiser out there.

1:57:12.372 --> 1:57:16.628
<i>The Cardinals refuse to go
quietly into the desert night...</i>

1:57:16.836 --> 1:57:21.674
...as the interminable season winds
down. Just trying to be poetic.

1:57:21.883 --> 1:57:23.885
<i>Wax on, Al. Wax on.</i>

1:57:26.012 --> 1:57:28.014
<i>A tough hit on Tidwell.</i>

1:57:28.222 --> 1:57:29.641
Nothing poetic about that.

1:57:29.807 --> 1:57:34.354
<i>- I'd have made that a touchdown.
- That's his sixth catch tonight.</i>

1:57:34.562 --> 1:57:37.399
<i>Split to the right. Swenson looks.</i>

1:57:37.608 --> 1:57:40.194
<i>A first down at the 19-yard line.</i>

1:57:41.445 --> 1:57:45.783
<i>Another savage hit
across the middle on Rod Tidwell.</i>

1:57:45.991 --> 1:57:48.661
<i>They're working Tidwell, aren't they?</i>

1:57:48.869 --> 1:57:53.707
- What does Daddy always say?
- It looks worse than it really is.

1:57:54.458 --> 1:57:56.962
He's gonna kill himself.

1:57:57.170 --> 1:57:59.130
- Be quiet.
- What did I say?

1:57:59.339 --> 1:58:02.676
Two minutes to play.
Dallas leading by three.

1:58:02.884 --> 1:58:07.389
<i>Second down and one now
at the Dallas 11-yard line.</i>

1:58:07.597 --> 1:58:11.059
<i>Swenson backs to pass. A blitz!</i>

1:58:11.267 --> 1:58:14.187
<i>Down he goes!
Sacked for a six-yard loss.</i>

1:58:14.396 --> 1:58:17.650
<i>Good move coming with a blitz
after Swenson.</i>

1:58:17.858 --> 1:58:22.655
<i>He had too many men in that pattern.
They couldn't pick up the blitz.</i>

1:58:24.573 --> 1:58:27.702
90 razor, X-out on one, ready?

1:58:29.328 --> 1:58:31.080
Here we go!

1:58:31.288 --> 1:58:34.250
<i>He had a chance to get rid of it.</i>

1:58:34.458 --> 1:58:37.796
<i>They've now gone to third and seven.</i>

1:58:38.005 --> 1:58:43.010
<i>In the waning moments of this game,
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.</i>

1:58:43.510 --> 1:58:47.389
<i>Tidwell in motion.
Moving back to his left now.</i>

1:58:47.597 --> 1:58:52.477
<i>Play fake. Swenson, protected well,
lofts one into the end zone.</i>

1:58:52.686 --> 1:58:55.230
<i>Tidwell! Touchdown, Cardinals!</i>

1:58:55.439 --> 1:58:59.152
<i>- Did you see him go up on that ball?
- He held onto it.</i>

1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:03.990
<i>He's still down. Tidwell, upside down,
hits the ground hard.</i>

1:59:04.198 --> 1:59:08.661
<i>- He maintains control of the football.
- He's hurt too.</i>

1:59:08.870 --> 1:59:10.538
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

1:59:10.747 --> 1:59:15.668
<i>- Concerned look on the players' faces.
- Get up, baby.</i>

1:59:17.004 --> 1:59:20.424
<i>The trainer out.
It's Tidwell's ninth catch.</i>

1:59:20.633 --> 1:59:24.219
<i>- Oh, my God.
- He gives Arizona the lead.</i>

1:59:32.353 --> 1:59:36.315
- Can you hear me?
- Blink! Come on, blink!

1:59:43.823 --> 1:59:47.369
Commercial! Show me
what's wrong with my husband.

1:59:47.577 --> 1:59:50.747
- I said he was too small for the NFL.
- Shut up.

1:59:50.955 --> 1:59:55.752
- It's the truth. I'm keeping it real!
- Tee Pee, shut up!

1:59:55.960 --> 2:00:01.342
Can't you be loyal to your brother?
Get the hell out of my house!

2:00:02.051 --> 2:00:05.429
Hello? Hold on.
It's Jerry Maguire.

2:00:06.430 --> 2:00:07.807
Punk!

2:00:10.101 --> 2:00:13.437
Jerry? Oh, my God,
I am freaking out.

2:00:13.646 --> 2:00:16.190
Marcee, he's unconscious.

2:00:16.399 --> 2:00:21.113
Just stay calm. Keep the lines open,
I will call you back.

2:00:21.321 --> 2:00:23.991
There are good doctors. Stay calm.

2:00:24.199 --> 2:00:27.995
You have to tell me something.
I am freaking here.

2:00:28.203 --> 2:00:32.833
We gotta stay calm.
Your family needs you to stay calm.

2:00:33.333 --> 2:00:37.295
I know, but my whole life
is this family...

2:00:37.505 --> 2:00:40.550
...and it does not work without him!

2:00:41.259 --> 2:00:45.638
<i>All eyes at Sun Devil Stadium
are focused on Rod Tidwell.</i>

2:00:45.847 --> 2:00:49.726
I am so sorry about
everything I said about your job.

2:00:49.934 --> 2:00:53.688
Just do whatever you can
to get Rod to me, please.

2:00:53.896 --> 2:00:58.152
Just do whatever you can.
Please, Jerry.

2:00:58.736 --> 2:01:03.657
<i>At a time like this, you just hope
his family is not watching this.</i>

2:01:04.825 --> 2:01:08.078
It could be his neck.
It could be his back.

2:01:12.082 --> 2:01:15.169
Blink, baby! Come on, wake up!

2:01:17.171 --> 2:01:19.466
We love you, Rod!

2:01:29.225 --> 2:01:31.227
Can you hear me?

2:01:31.853 --> 2:01:33.563
Can you hear me?

2:01:33.772 --> 2:01:36.232
Do you know where you are?

2:01:36.441 --> 2:01:39.445
<i>The trainer's still trying
to revive him.</i>

2:01:39.654 --> 2:01:41.989
We'd love to see some movement.

2:01:42.198 --> 2:01:45.493
- Rod?
- Let's get him off the field.

2:01:45.701 --> 2:01:48.829
- No.
- Get the gurney. Get him off the field.

2:01:49.038 --> 2:01:53.751
Wait, wait. Just let me
enjoy this for a minute.

2:01:53.959 --> 2:01:58.340
<i>We're looking for some movement.
Is that his head coming up?</i>

2:01:59.091 --> 2:02:01.134
<i>He's trying to get up.</i>

2:02:02.844 --> 2:02:04.388
<i>He is getting up.</i>

2:02:12.938 --> 2:02:16.024
Look at him! Oh, Mommy, he's okay.

2:02:20.029 --> 2:02:22.907
<i>The whole stadium is standing.</i>

2:02:23.116 --> 2:02:25.743
He's up on his feet
and the crowd loves it.

2:02:54.189 --> 2:02:59.612
Here's a guy who's normally very
truculent with the media, aloof...

2:03:15.045 --> 2:03:18.590
<i>- We're happy for you.
- He'll get a flag on this.</i>

2:03:18.798 --> 2:03:20.634
<i>Who cares!</i>

2:03:36.067 --> 2:03:39.154
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Helluva game.

2:03:40.238 --> 2:03:42.074
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

2:03:50.207 --> 2:03:52.501
<i>You are gonna pay.</i>

2:03:52.709 --> 2:03:55.420
I know. I know.

2:04:15.316 --> 2:04:17.318
Where's Jerry?

2:04:37.214 --> 2:04:39.008
You did it.

2:04:39.425 --> 2:04:41.094
You did.

2:04:42.804 --> 2:04:45.890
Why don't we have
that kind of relationship?

2:04:54.816 --> 2:04:57.152
Is that your porty or mine?

2:05:00.364 --> 2:05:01.949
Dorothy?

2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:06.329
Marcee. No, he's right here.

2:05:06.579 --> 2:05:10.291
It's Marcee. She couldn't
get through on your phone.

2:05:12.668 --> 2:05:17.214
We did it. I love you.
I love you so much!

2:05:21.636 --> 2:05:23.638
I love you!

2:05:28.685 --> 2:05:32.064
I love you, Tyson.
I love you, baby.

2:05:32.272 --> 2:05:34.900
How's the baby? How's Katie?

2:05:35.609 --> 2:05:38.445
Oh, I love you so much.

2:05:40.030 --> 2:05:43.242
You know ain't nothing
gonna happen to me.

2:05:51.626 --> 2:05:56.631
The problem is, like you were
saying earlier, the biorhythms.

2:05:58.049 --> 2:06:01.178
I was saying
the neural pathways are set.

2:06:01.387 --> 2:06:06.225
That's why it's hard
for people to change.

2:06:09.895 --> 2:06:14.566
I'm sorry, these stupid holidays
make me feel more divorced.

2:06:15.025 --> 2:06:19.738
You know? With the songs,
the constant chocolate-eating...

2:06:35.755 --> 2:06:38.717
I have a confession to make.

2:06:39.217 --> 2:06:44.098
I've listened to you all
tell a thousand sob stories.

2:06:44.306 --> 2:06:46.684
I've been very judgmental.

2:06:46.892 --> 2:06:51.188
Maybe you're all correct.
Men are the enemy.

2:06:51.397 --> 2:06:54.984
No, they're not the enemy.

2:06:55.234 --> 2:06:58.529
But I still love the enemy.

2:07:12.461 --> 2:07:13.754
Hello.

2:07:16.214 --> 2:07:18.592
I'm looking for my wife.

2:07:31.105 --> 2:07:32.273
Wait.

2:07:42.576 --> 2:07:47.122
If this is where it has to happen,
then it's where it happens.

2:07:48.248 --> 2:07:53.170
I'm not letting you get rid of me.
How about that?

2:07:58.759 --> 2:08:02.931
This used to be my specialty.
I was good in a living room.

2:08:03.139 --> 2:08:04.766
I'd do it alone.

2:08:05.558 --> 2:08:07.560
And now, I just...

2:08:13.608 --> 2:08:15.068
I don't know.

2:08:20.573 --> 2:08:22.368
But tonight...

2:08:23.285 --> 2:08:28.624
...our little project, our company
had a very big night.

2:08:29.125 --> 2:08:33.421
A very, very big night.

2:08:36.382 --> 2:08:38.426
But it wasn't complete.

2:08:40.928 --> 2:08:46.560
It wasn't nearly close to being
in the same vicinity as complete...

2:08:47.019 --> 2:08:49.688
...because I couldn't
share it with you.

2:08:51.023 --> 2:08:53.066
I couldn't hear your voice...

2:08:55.402 --> 2:08:58.030
...or laugh about it with you.

2:09:00.407 --> 2:09:03.578
I missed my... I missed my wife.

2:09:19.927 --> 2:09:25.142
We live in a cynical world.
A cynical world.

2:09:25.642 --> 2:09:30.356
And we work in a business
of tough competitors.

2:09:40.032 --> 2:09:41.825
I love you.

2:09:42.076 --> 2:09:43.495
You...

2:09:45.205 --> 2:09:47.040
...complete me.

2:09:48.458 --> 2:09:50.543
- And I just...
- Shut up.

2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:53.505
Just shut up.

2:09:54.214 --> 2:09:56.424
You had me at "hello."

2:09:57.634 --> 2:09:59.969
You had me at "hello."

2:10:12.566 --> 2:10:15.277
This is my best discussion group.

2:10:15.486 --> 2:10:20.199
Your father leaves home on
Christmas Eve, abandoning your family.

2:10:20.408 --> 2:10:24.871
Your mother had to sweep up
at the prison to pay your tuition.

2:10:25.288 --> 2:10:28.667
Your brother lost a leg
in a fishing accident.

2:10:28.875 --> 2:10:32.963
You've had a list of horrific
things happen in your life.

2:10:33.171 --> 2:10:36.842
- I'm not gonna cry, Roy.
- I've got some good news.

2:10:37.050 --> 2:10:39.928
I've just been handed a signed memo.

2:10:40.137 --> 2:10:44.350
It's a contract.
Arizona Cardinals. Four years.

2:10:44.559 --> 2:10:49.689
$11.2 million and you'll play
in your home state, where it started.

2:10:49.897 --> 2:10:51.858
What do you think of that?

2:11:11.962 --> 2:11:16.592
I love everybody.
I love my wife! Marcee!

2:11:17.843 --> 2:11:21.930
I love my kids!
Tyson and my new baby, Katie.

2:11:22.139 --> 2:11:27.270
My older brother, who got one leg,
and my younger brother, Tee Pee.

2:11:27.479 --> 2:11:31.232
You're militant, but I ain't
mad at you. I love you.

2:11:31.441 --> 2:11:34.569
I love my teammates.
I'm omitting someone.

2:11:34.819 --> 2:11:40.075
- We only have a half-hour show.
- I send love to my offensive line.

2:11:41.076 --> 2:11:45.289
Nice to see you. Congratulations.
Good for you.

2:11:45.956 --> 2:11:50.086
- You remember Troy from the Super Bowl?
- We met in '93.

2:11:50.336 --> 2:11:53.881
- That's right. I enjoyed your memo.
- Thank you.

2:11:54.215 --> 2:11:59.220
- A little slow but you come around.
- We're out of time.

2:11:59.428 --> 2:12:01.347
I'm forgetting somebody.

2:12:03.057 --> 2:12:05.102
Jerry Maguire...

2:12:05.811 --> 2:12:07.604
...my agent.

2:12:10.774 --> 2:12:13.860
You are my ambassador of kwan, man.

2:12:15.404 --> 2:12:19.491
Thank you. Congratulations.
We'll be right back.

2:12:23.328 --> 2:12:27.834
- How did you like the zoo, buddy?
- It was great!

2:12:28.042 --> 2:12:30.128
One, two, three.

2:12:33.631 --> 2:12:35.842
Hey, kid, throw the ball.

2:12:45.978 --> 2:12:47.312
Good throw, man.

2:12:50.357 --> 2:12:52.026
Did you see?

2:12:52.693 --> 2:12:55.362
Oh, no. Let's go.

2:12:55.779 --> 2:13:00.784
What? I'm not saying we'll throw him
into the major leagues tomorrow...

2:13:00.993 --> 2:13:03.787
...but he's got natural talent.

2:13:03.996 --> 2:13:08.501
I know the right people
that'll help develop his talent.

2:13:21.514 --> 2:13:24.560
Hey, I don't have all the answers.

2:13:24.810 --> 2:13:30.232
In life, to be honest, I've failed
as much as I've succeeded.

2:13:30.566 --> 2:13:34.111
But I love my wife,
I love my life...

2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:37.156
...and I wish you my kind of success.
