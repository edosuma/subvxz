<i> Previously on "nashville"...</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:04.036
Colt and I
went all the way.

00:04.038 --> 00:05.137
Putting your feelings
down on paper

00:05.139 --> 00:06.372
Makes it easier
to say it out loud.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.639
If she doesn't come clean
about our divorce,

00:07.641 --> 00:08.707
Then I will.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.709
I saw the news.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.678
What would you think about
coming out of retirement

00:12.680 --> 00:13.645
And going on the road
with me?

00:13.647 --> 00:15.681
Get off the stage!

00:15.683 --> 00:17.683
[ crowd murmurs ]

00:17.685 --> 00:18.817
You were amazing.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.185
Here in nashville --

00:20.187 --> 00:21.120
To find a job
that lets me do this.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.722
She pays to park her car
in the lot.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.791
I know rayna pulled some strings
to get me this job.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.192
Somebody made off
with $500.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.193
[ sighs ]

00:28.195 --> 00:30.062
I think we both know
who took it.

[ birds chirping ]

[ footsteps approaching ]

00:34.335 --> 00:35.634
Hey.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.069
Mwah.
How long have you been up?

00:37.071 --> 00:39.304
I don't know.
A while.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.806
I did not sleep well.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.375
Aw, baby,
I'm disappointed in vita, too.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.511
I just want to get
to the bottom of it.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.247
I mean, is it possible
that maybe frankie miscounted?

00:48.249 --> 00:50.349
I don't think so.
He said the money's gone.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.317
Looks like she is, too.
He tried to call her.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.887
Yeah, I did, too.
Got her voicemail.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.088
We still got her scheduled
to work.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.057
See if she shows up tonight,
I guess.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.025
Or today. She's supposed to
come by the offices

01:00.027 --> 01:01.326
And meet
with bucky and me.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.528
Let me know if she does

01:02.530 --> 01:04.329
Or if I need to hire somebody
for that shift.

01:04.331 --> 01:07.332
Yeah. What do you got
going on today?

01:07.334 --> 01:09.201
Hear our buddy riff bell's
coming out of retirement?

01:09.203 --> 01:11.103
Yes, I did.
With our old buddy luke wheeler.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.571
[ chuckles ]
that's right.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.507
I figure he's gonna need some
kind of warm-up show, you know?

01:15.509 --> 01:18.844
And, uh, I got just the place
for him to do that.

01:18.846 --> 01:19.978
[ chuckles ]

01:22.917 --> 01:24.216
Job interview?

01:24.218 --> 01:26.919
Listening party
at highway 65.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.020
It's a great record.
Come on.

01:28.022 --> 01:29.588
You --
you can't be worried.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.557
Well, it's
a little nerve-racking,

01:31.559 --> 01:33.959
Watching rayna, bucky,
and half a dozen other people

01:33.961 --> 01:35.928
Listen to every single track
on the album.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.296
I just hope
no one yawns.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.431
Oh, no. They're real respectful
at those things.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.133
Or they were back when I had
a recording career.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.434
[ sighs ]

01:42.436 --> 01:45.437
Though I did get contacted
by a label this morning.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.606
A gay label
out of atlanta.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.774
What makes you think
they're gay?

01:48.776 --> 01:50.309
[ chuckles ]

01:50.311 --> 01:52.044
They're called
three dollar vinyl,
for starters.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.114
"queer as
a three-dollar bill"?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.316
Congratulations...?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.718
I guess, if you call
driving four hours for a meeting

01:59.720 --> 02:01.286
Something
to get excited about.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.888
Well, at least
it's something.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.423
You know what?

02:04.425 --> 02:07.292
Next time I whine
when I should be applauding you,

02:07.294 --> 02:08.627
Tell me to shut up,

02:08.629 --> 02:10.929
Because you have worked
your ass off for this,

02:10.931 --> 02:12.664
And you deserve
all the success in the world.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.233
Thank you, buddy.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.435
But none of this would be
happening without scarlett.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.669
We're in this together.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.805
See you later.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.974
Luke: Look, uh, word leaked
about me pulling this one

02:21.976 --> 02:23.509
Out of retirement
and onto the tour,

02:23.511 --> 02:24.343
And guess what.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.644
Ticket sales went nuts,

02:25.646 --> 02:26.812
And that's before
today's announcement.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.247
Sean?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.848
You think fans
are just feeling nostalgic?

02:29.850 --> 02:32.484
I think people
appreciate authenticity.

02:32.486 --> 02:36.255
Riff is not some brand-new,
auto-tuned, pop-country act.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.856
He is the real deal.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.858
It's been 15 years
since you last toured, riff.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.627
How's it gonna be
playing stadiums again?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.695
I always loved playing
to 50,000,

02:43.697 --> 02:45.531
But getting out
in front of a couple hundred

02:45.533 --> 02:47.332
Is probably the best way
to jump-start this thing,

02:47.334 --> 02:49.701
And I'm gonna be doing that
tomorrow night

02:49.703 --> 02:52.471
At my buddy deacon claybourne's
place, the beverly.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.940
And listen, y'all best
get your tickets for that now,

02:54.942 --> 02:57.209
Because you won't be able
to get any for the tour.

02:57.211 --> 03:01.313
As of 10:45 this morning,
we are officially sold out.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.215
Yeah, you're welcome.
Still my idea.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.883
[ chuckles ]
thank y'all.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.451
So that's it.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.020
Launch date for the album's
totally locked in.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.321
Which means
we got a lot going on.
Yeah.

How are things going
at the studio?
Oh, great.

I've never felt so in sync
with a producer before.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.471
I mean, avery's super smart,
and he's super creative.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.573
He's so fun.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.874
I mean, working with him

03:28.876 --> 03:31.143

thing to do right now.

03:31.145 --> 03:33.378

You?

03:56.270 --> 03:59.438

I've seen you here, as well.

an incredible debut album,

that's a career-making album.

for you guys.

between you --

05:08.809 --> 05:10.776
There's not a false moment
in the whole thing.

it's really spectacular.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.514
Well, we just want to
say thank you

05:15.516 --> 05:17.249
For letting us make
the album we wanted to make.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.918
It'll be tough to narrow it down
to just one single.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.854
I agree with you, and yet,
my money's on the last one.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.590
I know it's not
the conventional choice,

05:25.592 --> 05:28.360
But it's just so textured and
rich and -- and -- and exciting.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.795
I-I think that's the way
to launch the record.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.463
What do you guys think?

05:31.465 --> 05:33.832
Um, whatever you guys
think is best. Uh...

Yeah.
Uh, w-whatever's best.

Well, fantastic job.

on this thing.

a successful listening party.

there are no guarantees,

05:46.647 --> 05:49.047

You're here early.

Never left.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.302
You didn't go home?

06:10.304 --> 06:12.237
Went over this place
with a fine-tooth comb.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.805
Wanted to make sure
nothing else was missing.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.207
All right, look.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.375
First of all, frankie,
we don't even know

06:16.377 --> 06:17.676
That vita took that money,
all right?

06:17.678 --> 06:18.977
We got a lot of people
who work here.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.712
It was vita.
All right.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.481
Rayna's supposed to
meet with her today.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.583
If she shows up,
rayna's gonna get a read on it,

06:24.585 --> 06:26.351
And she'll tell us
what she thinks.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.854
So we're not calling the cops?
We're gonna let rayna handle it?

06:28.856 --> 06:29.921
Would you quit
with this?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.356
Please,
for one second, all right?

06:31.358 --> 06:33.392
We got better things to
talk about -- bigger things.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.427
Riff bell is gonna be
performing here tomorrow night.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.162
How about that?
Come again?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.597
[ chuckles ]
you're damn right, all right?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.831
I heard he was going
out on tour,

06:39.833 --> 06:41.700
I figured he needed
to shake the cobwebs out,

06:41.702 --> 06:42.768
So I called him up.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.102
So he's taking my slot?

06:44.104 --> 06:46.905
We'll get you another slot here,
frankie. I promise you.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.407
This is riff bell --
a living legend.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.908
He's gonna be
up on that stage.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.576
That's gonna put the beverly
on the map.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.613
Now, come on, man.
This is good news.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.814
It's a big damn deal.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.184
All right.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.723
This place is fantastic.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.957
Oh, thank you.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.626
Have a seat.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.798
Um...I need
to ask you something.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.469
Turns out some money went
missing at the bar last night.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.603
Missing how?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.872
Well, they think
it was stolen.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.374
That sucks.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.810
Yeah.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.912
Wait.
You think I took it?

07:26.914 --> 07:29.581
I have to ask
the question.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.250
You can go through my stuff,
my guitar case, my car.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.286
I mean, just tell me
what I can do.
I'm not gonna
go through your stuff.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.754
Well, I'm not a thief.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.590
I mean, why would I steal from
someone who just gave me a job?

07:38.592 --> 07:41.159
I don't know.
Um...

07:41.161 --> 07:43.295
You wouldn't,
would you?

07:43.297 --> 07:45.063
I wouldn't.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.232
So you didn't.
No.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.301
Well, I'm glad,
and I'm relieved.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.802
I'm so sorry
that happened.
Yeah.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.905
Let's -- let's hear
some music.

¶¶

08:04.751 --> 08:06.151
All right.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.286
All right, thank you, baby.

08:08.288 --> 08:11.456
That was rayna.
Vita showed up.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.492
They had a long talk,
she says she didn't do it.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.327
She asked her point-blank?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.096
Yeah.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.432
We need to do the same thing
with the rest of the staff,

08:20.434 --> 08:22.367
See if we can figure out
what's going on around here.

08:22.369 --> 08:25.170
All due respect for rayna,

08:25.172 --> 08:27.339
Why would a thief
admit anything

08:27.341 --> 08:29.508
To someone
who's trying to help her?

08:29.510 --> 08:30.809
Well, that's the point,
frankie.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.977
We are trying to help her,

08:31.979 --> 08:33.311
So why on earth would
she try to steal from us?

08:33.313 --> 08:35.013
No idea.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.849
But I'm not comfortable having
her back to work either way.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.317
All right, look, man.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.486
It is innocent until
proven guilty last I heard.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.555
So if you want to put security
cameras all over the damn place,

08:43.557 --> 08:44.723
You go ahead and do that.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.324
But I'm asking you
to let this go right now.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.126
We got people and reporters
coming in from all over,

08:48.128 --> 08:49.461
And we need to be ready
for them.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.868
[ laughs ]

08:56.870 --> 08:58.303
They say
nap when she naps,

08:58.305 --> 09:01.006
But when do I clean, cook,
pay bills, eat?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.374
[ chuckling ]
exactly.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.309
No, I mean, I learned
to hold her in one arm

09:04.311 --> 09:05.844
And make a sandwich
with the other.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.078
You know,
thank god for emily,

09:07.080 --> 09:08.146
Or I wouldn't get
anything done.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.548
Emily?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.716
Yeah, she's a friend who --
who babysits for me.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.184
Oh.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.053
My ex hasn't really
been involved much,

09:15.055 --> 09:17.389
But it's --
it's a long story.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.258
Same here.
Long and a boring story.
[ cellphone dings ]

09:20.260 --> 09:23.361
Sorry.
I, uh, set a reminder.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.729
Oh.
It's just
a work thing.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.365
Well, we should
hang out again sometime.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.068
I mean, the whole
[sighs] single-parent thing

09:30.070 --> 09:31.603
Can be a little isolating,
you know?

09:31.605 --> 09:33.405
Yeah.
Yeah, we should.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.943
Hey, are you, uh, free tonight,
by any chance,

09:37.945 --> 09:40.011
To, uh,
maybe grab a bite?

09:40.013 --> 09:41.580
Um, I would be
if I had a sitter.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.449
Right. Right.

09:44.451 --> 09:48.119
But if you wouldn't mind coming
to my place, I could cook.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.623
Yeah.
That sounds great.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.558
[ bottles clink ]
may your record get
all the attention it deserves.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.526
Thank you.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.794
Mmm.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.195
So what's next?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.230
Well, it's too early
to talk release date

09:59.232 --> 10:01.266
Since they're launching
layla's record first.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.768
But we do need to finalize
writing credits and licenses --

10:03.770 --> 10:05.470
Which I better call
and confirm.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.571

Are you sure
you're all right with this?

10:12.813 --> 10:15.380
With my song
being the single?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.414
Why wouldn't I be?

10:16.416 --> 10:18.216
That was the consensus,
wasn't it?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.885
Well, because technically
it's my song since I wrote it

10:20.887 --> 10:22.153
And it's mostly my vocal,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.455
And I just don't think
it's fair --

10:23.457 --> 10:25.290
Scarlett, it's all about
what's best for the band,

10:25.292 --> 10:26.992
So it's got to be the song
that tells the best story.

stopped performing.

incident the other night.

That's for sure.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.535

16:27.187 --> 16:30.254
And, uh, we got split up
when we were 12.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.991
That's awful.
You don't have to
feel sorry for me, by the way.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.359
'cause, you know, like,

16:34.361 --> 16:36.127

don't have great parents.

Look, honey,
you're a survivor.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.765
And you have made
beautiful music

16:40.767 --> 16:42.367
Out of a really unfortunate
circumstance.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.301
Isn't that amazing?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.169
Yeah.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.506

saved my life.

cool new music.

Wow. Is that something
that you want to do?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.728
Uh, I don't know
about long-term,

17:10.730 --> 17:12.463
But for now
it's just nice being normal.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.700
I mean, with my dad,
it was just music all the time.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.902
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with that.

17:17.904 --> 17:21.205

just not the whole star thing.

he fought in vietnam.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.939
He needs to pull out
of the beverly.

17:54.941 --> 17:58.242
And we need to look at
pre-records for the tour.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.844
You out of your mind, ken?

17:59.846 --> 18:01.579
I can't ask a damn legend
to lip-sync.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.347
It'd humiliate
the hell out of him.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.416
And me, if I had to
ask him to do that.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.785
I know, but we're
in salvage mode, luke.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.254

to salvage?

the difference.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.983
And I think it's only fair
that we're featured equally.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.885
Well, the song kind of feels
like both of you.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.554
Yeah,
I-I trust your judgment.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.389
I'm just --
I'm concerned, is all.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.356
All right.
Well, I'll tell you what.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.524
Why don't I
run it past rayna,

26:00.526 --> 26:01.992
And we'll set up a meeting
to discuss.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.032

26:08.034 --> 26:11.368
Hey, um,
I managed by some miracle

26:11.370 --> 26:13.370
To snag two tickets

26:13.372 --> 26:15.005
For the riff bell thing tonight
at the beverly.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.840
Do you want to come?

26:16.842 --> 26:19.910
Aw, damn, that sounds amazing,
but I have plans with sienna.

Who?

The woman from the park.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.081
Oh.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.951
Oh, I guess, um -- I guess
your date went well, huh?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.786
It definitely exceeded
expectations.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.721
Oh. That's great.

26:30.723 --> 26:33.691
Okay, well, have fun tonight.
You know, more fun.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.758
All right. You too.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.759
It's gonna be
a killer show.

They're almost ready for you,
layla.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.432
Hey,
I asked for this chilled.

Is it really that hard
to get what I want around here?

you know?

I didn't really want him
driving me.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.147
No, of course.
I'm here for you.

for a while?

play you guys a song

to talk to cash,

27:09.061 --> 27:10.494
So if you could please
leave us alone.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.339
You were right
about vita.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.575
I should have listened to you,
and I didn't,

27:24.577 --> 27:26.977
And for that, I'm sorry.

27:29.582 --> 27:30.814
And I should have asked

27:30.816 --> 27:32.750
Before I gave riff
your slot tonight.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.151
Forget it.
No, I should've.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.120
You're my partner, frankie.
I couldn't do this without you.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.622
Hell, I wouldn't want to.

27:38.624 --> 27:41.358
I appreciate that.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.861
All right, so, what do you say
we put all this behind us,

27:43.863 --> 27:45.129
Look forward to tonight

27:45.131 --> 27:49.166
When we make our place
the place to be in nashville?

27:52.004 --> 27:54.638

Hey.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.053
What do you want?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.888
Well, I'd love
an explanation.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.322
'cause you took
that money.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.158
And you looked me
straight in the eye

28:14.160 --> 28:15.559
And you lied to me
about it.

28:15.561 --> 28:18.462
I mean, I was making plans
for you and defending you.

28:18.464 --> 28:19.897
Why would you do that?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.365
I'm sorry.
I needed the money bad.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.400
You needed the money?
Yeah.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.169
But you had a job.
You had a paycheck coming.
I-I didn't have time
to wait, okay?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.870
My sister --
she got herself into trouble,

28:26.872 --> 28:29.206
And, you know, it wasn't
the kind of trouble where
you can go like,

28:29.208 --> 28:31.742
"oh, let me get
my finances in order."

28:31.744 --> 28:33.744
Okay?
It was $500 or her life.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.179
Yeah,
you'll have to forgive me

28:35.181 --> 28:36.714
If I don't believe
a word you're saying.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.649
Everything I told you
was the truth.

28:38.651 --> 28:40.184
Except the part where you lied
about being a thief.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.386
But you don't know
what it's like for me.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.721
I lied because, look,

28:43.723 --> 28:45.522
The vita that you and I
talked about yesterday, okay --

28:45.524 --> 28:49.193
The one -- the one that had
a crap life and rose above it --

Okay, that's the vita
that I want to be.

I supposed to do?

you gave me a job,

all of my dreams come true,

do me one more favor?

Could you, uh --

29:00.840 --> 29:02.706
Could you give me some cash
to pay off some bad guys?"

29:02.708 --> 29:04.408
So you just took it instead?

29:04.410 --> 29:06.577

I swear.

that we can start over?

I'm losing one of your eyes.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.272
Could you maybe twist shoulders
just a little bit to me?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.607
Or maybe<i> you</i> could
move around a little bit

29:36.609 --> 29:38.609
So I don't have to stand
in these unnatural positions.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.544
Okay, w-why don't we take
a little break, okay, guys?

29:40.546 --> 29:42.412
Please?

29:42.414 --> 29:44.815
This is seriously lame.
I hate this whole setup.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.817
Layla, I'm not sure
why you're acting this way,

29:46.819 --> 29:48.619
But I'm gonna speak candidly,
okay?

29:48.621 --> 29:51.088
I think you are
incredibly talented.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.290
That's why
I'm working with you.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.626
But I have been down this road
with juliette

29:55.628 --> 29:57.327
In terms
of the bad behavior,

29:57.329 --> 29:59.096
And I'm not interested
in doing that.

29:59.098 --> 30:02.332
So let's find out what
you're<i> actually</i> worried about,

30:02.334 --> 30:04.668
And we can nip this attitude
thing right in the bud.

right --
look, I just --

30:08.407 --> 30:09.740
I thought that
avery and I were friends,

30:09.742 --> 30:11.141
So I called him earlier,

30:11.143 --> 30:12.743
Inviting him to the riff bell
thing at the beverly tonight,

30:12.745 --> 30:13.977
And he just --
he already had plans.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.479

Avery's been through a lot,
but so have you.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.424
And losing someone
the way that you did,

30:27.426 --> 30:28.926
It creates this void.

30:28.928 --> 30:32.362
And sometimes when you work
closely with somebody else,

30:32.364 --> 30:35.499
It feels like an answer
to this void, but it's not.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.702
The only answer to the void
is time.

30:38.704 --> 30:43.340
So do yourself and your album --
and me -- a favor,

30:43.342 --> 30:45.175

who got a call from bucky,

a different single.

what the heck, scarlett?

with the decision.

You don't seem fine.
You seem highly agitated.

a song we wrote together?

31:25.417 --> 31:26.884

the best single, and it's true.

to handle it.

Deacon's really turned
this place around.

to you and your band.

you can return the favor

and having a drink with me.

I keep thinking

38:14.459 --> 38:16.493
I shouldn't have broken up
with him.

38:16.495 --> 38:19.329
Maybe I was being
too judgmental or whatever.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.665
Um, more like the other way
around, isn't it?

38:21.667 --> 38:24.067
I mean, from what you told me
he said to you,

38:24.069 --> 38:25.468
It doesn't seem at all

38:25.470 --> 38:28.238
Like he's that supportive
of you or your career.

That's what's so weird.

to really support me.

You're both young.

You're both still trying
to figure out who you are.

into the foster system

39:47.352 --> 39:48.918
When she was
daphne's age.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.588
And she told me that her sister
was in some kind of trouble

39:51.590 --> 39:53.390
And that's why
she needed the money.

if it's true.
