09:44.584 --> 09:46.324
That's really sweet,
but unfortunately

09:46.368 --> 09:48.109
my brother and sister
are visiting

09:48.152 --> 09:49.545
from Vermont that weekend.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.677
Oh.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.982
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'd love to be there,

09:52.026 --> 09:53.549
but I just can't
leave them alone

09:53.593 --> 09:54.942
on the one night
they're in town.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.378
Yeah...

09:56.421 --> 09:59.163
You know what?
Bring 'em.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.687
Seriously?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.036
Yes.To your wedding?

10:02.079 --> 10:04.168
To my wedding, yes.
Let's add a couple more.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.388
The more the merrier. [laughs]

10:06.431 --> 10:08.129
Look, they're coming
with their spouses.

10:08.172 --> 10:11.349
Spouses. I love spouses. I'm
about to be a spouse. Bring 'em!

10:11.393 --> 10:12.742
Are you sure?

10:12.786 --> 10:15.571
Yes, absolutely. Bring 'em.
Bring 'em all, Dean!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.181
Thanks, Nick.Yeah.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.053
Looking forward to it.You got it.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.316
Okay.
[laughing]:
All right.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.579
All right.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.668
Damn it. Damn it!

10:30.717 --> 10:32.849
So, in addition to
the dean and his wife,

10:32.893 --> 10:35.591
you invited four
members of his family?

10:35.635 --> 10:38.115
Your mom is gonna kill you.

10:38.159 --> 10:42.206
Well, if she does,
that opens up one slot.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.078
Oh, and Shannon's never gonna
speak to me again,

10:44.121 --> 10:45.688
so there's another spot.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.647
Ooh, that's great.
That's two.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.518
Who else can we piss off?

10:49.561 --> 10:51.128
[knocking on door]

10:51.172 --> 10:54.697
Mm. [clears throat]

10:54.741 --> 10:56.003
Oh, hey, Dad.
Hi.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.135
What are you doing here?

10:58.179 --> 10:59.484
I came by to let you know

10:59.528 --> 11:02.444
that I'm gonna need
a plus-one to the wedding.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.708
Okay, but first of all,

11:05.752 --> 11:08.015
you were almost
a minus-one.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.018
So you can bring a no one.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.194
Come on,
weddings are romantic.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.239
I want to share it
with someone special.

11:15.283 --> 11:17.894
Once I settle
on who that person is.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.245
Okay, what does
that even mean?

11:21.289 --> 11:23.683
It means I'm seriously
dating someone,

11:23.726 --> 11:27.034
and I'm dating someone else
seriously.

11:27.077 --> 11:30.080
No wonder Shannon goes
for awful guys.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.126
Look at who her
male role model is.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.257
What are you talking about?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.956
Shannon's boyfriend JoJo
hit on Clem.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.261
Her?

11:38.480 --> 11:41.178
Isn't she a little
old for him?

11:42.789 --> 11:45.052
I think he has some sort
of weird fetish.[both laugh]

11:45.095 --> 11:47.663
Okay, I am not
"fetish" old.

11:49.143 --> 11:51.188
I just don't want Shannon dating
some guy

11:51.232 --> 11:52.755
who's horrible
and cheating on her.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.539
That type of behavior
makes me sick.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.280
It's no way to treat a woman.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.544
That's how
you're treating the women

11:59.588 --> 12:00.763
that you're dating
right now.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.766
Yeah, but this is my daughter.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.682
And those women are also
someone's daughter.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.554
Yeah, but not mine.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.297
Am I not being clear?

12:14.342 --> 12:16.126
I don't know what to do.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.041
Shannon doesn't believe
that he hit on me.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.608
Well, if you really want
to prove it,

12:19.651 --> 12:21.828
we could catch him in the act
hitting on you again.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.307
Get the whole thing on tape.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.787
Now, you may have to, uh,

12:24.831 --> 12:28.095
hoo-chi-waa-waa
a little to reel him in.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.532
No. Dad, no.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.316
This is an insane idea.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.841
You got a better one,
Mrs. Robinson?

12:34.884 --> 12:36.538
Come on.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.235
You want to bust this kid
or not?

12:38.279 --> 12:40.411
I mean, the last time
that she dated this guy,

12:40.455 --> 12:43.110
she almost
moved in with him.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.112
You know what?
Fine. Let's do it.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.549
On second thought,
I'm not sure we should.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.770
I mean, it's kind of an abuse
of my power as a cop.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.295
[laughs]

12:54.338 --> 12:56.427
Does no one get
my sense of humor?

13:02.825 --> 13:04.131
NICK: Hey, Mom. ROSE: Hey, sweetheart.

13:04.174 --> 13:07.351
It has taken me
18 straight hours,

13:07.395 --> 13:11.225
but I have single-handedly
rearranged the entire wedding

13:11.268 --> 13:16.099
and squeezed in two extra seats
for your boss.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.667
[laughs] It was dark,
dark days over here,

13:18.710 --> 13:21.713
but we got through it,
just barely.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.150
Well, thanks, Mom.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.804
I really appreciate it.Mm.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.718
But there's just,
uh, one...

13:26.762 --> 13:28.285
little hiccup.Hiccup?

13:28.329 --> 13:30.287
Oh, God, not a hiccup.

13:30.331 --> 13:33.116
Well, I talked to the dean,

13:33.160 --> 13:36.380
and he is thrilled-- like,
thrilled-- to come, right?

13:36.424 --> 13:40.341
But, uh, so are
the four other people

13:40.384 --> 13:41.603
I told him
he could bring.

13:41.646 --> 13:45.912
I was in labor 72 hours and...
[laughs]

13:45.955 --> 13:48.392
this is how you repay me?

13:48.436 --> 13:51.091
Was I a bad father?

13:51.134 --> 13:53.397
Is this your way
of punishing me?

13:53.441 --> 13:55.356
Look, it's going to be fine.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.271
Here, let me see
the seating chart.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.968
Okay, what's this in the middle?

13:59.012 --> 14:00.796
Can't we just put
the table there?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.363
That is the wedding tree.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.886
People put gifts
underneath it,

14:03.930 --> 14:06.236
money and messages
on its leaves.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.674
It is a family tradition,
and my one and only demand.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.241
Mom, you've made dozens
of demands.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.330
You didn't let me finish.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.376
About a tree.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.247
Mom, I get it, I understand,
but it would solve all

14:17.291 --> 14:20.903
of our problems if we just...
got rid of the tree.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.168
Fine.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.257
I will get rid
of the tree.

14:27.301 --> 14:30.130
I will rearrange
everything.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.392
Yeah.

14:31.435 --> 14:34.177
Again.

14:34.221 --> 14:38.312
72 hours!

14:42.490 --> 14:44.622
Okay, so this is how
it's gonna work:

14:44.666 --> 14:46.537
Linda and I are gonna be seated
right over there.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.713
And as long as I'm facing
your table,

14:48.757 --> 14:52.630
my body cam will record every
disgusting act this punk does.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.545
That seems great.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.547
And it's so lovely
to meet you, Linda.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.593
And who is Linda?

14:58.636 --> 15:00.464
She's my girlfriend.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.640
I can't just be in a restaurant
by myself like a loser.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.207
I got to blend in.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.080
This is all
very exciting.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.517
Good luck getting this
young man to hit on you.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.128
Why, thank you, Linda.

15:13.564 --> 15:14.914
Oh, he's here.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.090
Sit down. Go, go, go.

15:17.133 --> 15:20.136
Hey. I was hoping
I'd hear from you.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.096
I thought we should talk about
what happened the other day.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.663
You know, when you were at
my apartment with Shannon?

15:25.707 --> 15:29.015
[laughs] You mean when
I said, you know.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.321
CLEM:
I do know.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.323
And I want you
to tell me everything

15:33.367 --> 15:34.977
that you want to do to me.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.458
But speak up and enunciate.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.286
Oh, yeah.

15:39.329 --> 15:42.898
I bet you'd like me
to enunciate.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.553
You don't know what that word
means, do you?

15:45.596 --> 15:48.121
I do not.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.905
Can I get the steak?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.995
No. You know the drill.
Chicken or cheaper.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.345
Freddy?

15:55.389 --> 15:57.957
Stacy. What are you doing here?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.785
You left me a voice mail saying
to meet you here.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.831
Well, yeah, but, uh,
you never called me back.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.224
Who is this?

16:04.267 --> 16:05.529
I'm his girlfriend.
Who are you?

16:05.573 --> 16:06.878
I'm his girlfriend.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.315
Excuse me, sir?

16:08.358 --> 16:11.144
I'm out of breadsticks.
Do you have any?

16:11.187 --> 16:13.146
Hang on, Clem.
Clem?

16:13.189 --> 16:14.277
How many girls in here
do you know?

16:14.321 --> 16:15.539
Are you cheating on me, Freddy?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.324
If anything,
he's cheating on me.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.673
Go to hell, Freddy.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.370
Yeah, Freddy, go to hell.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.198
Stacy, wait!

16:22.242 --> 16:25.027
Linda, also wait!

16:27.856 --> 16:29.466
Yo, want to bounce?

16:29.510 --> 16:31.207
'Cause I got my mom's Kia

16:31.251 --> 16:35.081
[singsongy]:
if you want to get weird.

16:36.082 --> 16:39.172
Now you say that?

16:39.215 --> 16:42.044
What is going on?

16:42.088 --> 16:44.394
I am not sleeping
with my sister's boyfriend.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.875
Well, I'm not her
boyfriend anymore.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.224
Shannon broke up
with me yesterday.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.921
She did?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.445
Why didn't she tell me that?

16:51.488 --> 16:56.102
I don't know, but I do know
my Kia has lay-flat seats.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.234
Well, my mom's Kia.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.237
Gross.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.196
I can't help it.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.545
You're such a babe.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.373
Tell me about the '90s!

17:11.769 --> 17:13.728
[knocking on door]

17:13.771 --> 17:15.773
Come in.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.340
Oh, Dean Kaiser.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.038
Please, no need
to climb over to me.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.736
Uh, I just came to give you
some good news.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.303
You got the big office.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.217
I did?
[laughs]

17:24.260 --> 17:26.915
[groans]

17:26.958 --> 17:28.786
That's great.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.093
Congratulations, Nick.
You deserve it.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.008
Oh. D-Dean Kaiser, wait.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.271
Look, I know the only way
you could come to my wedding

17:35.315 --> 17:38.970
is if your whole family comes,
but we don't have enough room.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.450
Oh.And I'm sorry.

17:40.494 --> 17:44.454
If it costs me the office,
I totally understand.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.413
Wait, did you just invite me

17:46.456 --> 17:48.328
to the wedding so you can get
the big office?

17:48.371 --> 17:50.330
Maybe, kinda, sorta. Yes.

17:50.373 --> 17:53.333
[laughing]

17:56.118 --> 17:58.816
Why are we laughing?
I don't understand.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.036
I hate weddings.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.779
And when I thought I told you
about my family being in town,

18:04.822 --> 18:06.781
I'd be off the hook,
but then you invited them all

18:06.824 --> 18:08.478
like a big old psycho.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.524
So you don't want to come?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.265
None of us want to come.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.223
Oh, this...

18:14.267 --> 18:15.355
Thank you, Dean.
Thank you.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.573
Thank you.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.272
Thank you. [grunts]

18:19.315 --> 18:20.664
So, so do I still
get the office?

18:20.708 --> 18:22.536
Do you promise to never
invite me to anything again?

18:22.579 --> 18:24.364
I will exclude you from
anything and everything

18:24.407 --> 18:25.974
until the day you die.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.416
Thank you, Dean. [whoops]

18:38.595 --> 18:39.988
Hey.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.381
Where have you been?

18:41.424 --> 18:43.861
JoJo had a rap battle
with DJ Sesame Bagel.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.907
Toasted him.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.214
I ran into him, Shannon.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.303
I know that you broke up
with him. What happened?

18:50.346 --> 18:52.305
It's none of your business.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.915
What did he do?

18:53.958 --> 18:55.264
Did he hit on somebody?

18:55.308 --> 18:56.352
Maybe.

18:56.396 --> 18:57.353
Who?

18:57.397 --> 19:00.182
You. Okay? He hit on you.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.532
Wait, I thought you didn't
believe me.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.666
Of course I believed you.
#BelieveAllWomen. Duh.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.582
Everybody hits on you
all the time,

19:08.625 --> 19:11.062
and it's super annoying.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.152
Wait, really?

19:13.195 --> 19:14.414
Even that UPS guy?

19:14.457 --> 19:17.199
Are you kidding me?

19:17.243 --> 19:19.506
Dude was all, "Are you
interested in my package?"

19:19.549 --> 19:21.638
It wasn't even a package,
it was an envelope.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.860
I'm just trying to keep
your ego in check.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.819
But then why did you pretend
not to believe me about JoJo?

19:28.863 --> 19:31.170
Because I hate it
when you're right.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.608
And you're right a lot,
and I hate it.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.438
Okay, look.

19:38.481 --> 19:41.919
Shannon, when I was your age,
I made a lot of mistakes.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.531
I can't even tell you
how many JoJos I dated

19:44.574 --> 19:46.272
before I finally
found Nick.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.710
I don't want you to have
to go through that.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.452
That's really cool of you
to say, Clem. Thanks.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.454
Nothing would
make me happier

19:54.497 --> 19:56.499
than if you learn
from my mistakes.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.286
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.464
What?

20:04.507 --> 20:06.379
Clem, if you didn't date
all those losers,

20:06.422 --> 20:08.555
you'd never get how great
you have it now.

20:08.598 --> 20:11.427
[scoffs]
Don't rob me of that.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.823
Yeah, that's not really
the point I was trying to make.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.652
But it's the point you made.

20:18.695 --> 20:22.221
And as we established,
you're always right.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.878
Hey, babe.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.098
Sorry I'm late.
I got lost trying to find my way

20:30.141 --> 20:31.752
out of my new giant office!

20:31.795 --> 20:33.797
[gasps]
That's great.

20:33.841 --> 20:34.798
[laughs]

20:34.842 --> 20:37.410
[laughs]
I've got good news, too.

20:37.453 --> 20:40.848
Yeah?
Shannon kicked JoJo
to the curb.

20:40.891 --> 20:43.285
Also, more good news:

20:43.329 --> 20:45.069
Everyone ishitting on me.
