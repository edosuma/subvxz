00:04.090 --> 00:07.326
Wow. They found a way to make
the human being even creepier.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.693
Covering him in icicles.

00:08.712 --> 00:10.129
I think it's festive.

00:10.163 --> 00:11.714
Yeah, my favorite
Christmas tradition

00:11.748 --> 00:13.332
is trimming the hellraiser.

00:13.366 --> 00:15.184
Guys, I found something
we can watch together

00:15.218 --> 00:16.752
for Christmas this year.

00:16.803 --> 00:20.272
The long-lost 1981 <i>Inspector
Spacetime Holiday Special.</i>

00:20.307 --> 00:22.608
Run time two and half hours
and so critically reviled

00:22.642 --> 00:25.127
that after it aired, the creator
has his knighthood revoked.

00:25.161 --> 00:26.612
That sounds terrible.

00:26.646 --> 00:28.247
I want to watch it twice,

00:28.281 --> 00:30.249
but I'm spending Christmas
with my relatives.

00:30.283 --> 00:33.118
Or rather, I'm spending
the day with my relatives

00:33.153 --> 00:34.770
while they refuse
to acknowledge Christmas.

00:34.821 --> 00:37.556
You Jehovah's Witnesses--
so severe.

00:37.590 --> 00:39.558
Andre and I will be spending
Christmas giving gifts

00:39.592 --> 00:41.493
to the more persuadable
of our Jewish friends.

00:41.528 --> 00:43.946
I wouldn't call an unannounced
visit from your pastor "a gift."

00:43.997 --> 00:45.397
And don't bother this year.

00:45.415 --> 00:46.949
I'll be at the movies
with my bubbe.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.468
You're not taking both of them?

00:49.502 --> 00:51.470
Well, one's dead.

00:51.504 --> 00:52.788
- What?
- I was looking forward

00:52.839 --> 00:54.590
to hanging out with you guys
this Christmas.

00:54.624 --> 00:56.709
This semester has been so long
and dark and angry.

00:56.743 --> 00:57.743
I was thinking we could have

00:57.777 --> 00:59.044
some light-hearted fun
as a family.

00:59.079 --> 01:00.212
I think what we've learned,
Abed,

01:00.246 --> 01:02.514
is that attempts to make
the holidays brighter

01:02.549 --> 01:04.183
tend to give them
a certain darkness.

01:04.217 --> 01:05.718

The Glee Club
is at Westside Hospital,

03:03.803 --> 03:07.105
recuperating from
a collective nervous breakdown.

03:07.140 --> 03:10.676
This is the second glee club
we've lost in two years.

03:10.710 --> 03:13.211
We might have to cancel
the Christmas pageant.

03:13.229 --> 03:16.064
And to think they were
this close to regionals.

03:16.099 --> 03:17.115
What the hell are regionals?

03:17.150 --> 03:19.568
They're this close, Pierce.

03:19.602 --> 03:22.554
Anyway, an old friend
wants to talk to you.

03:22.572 --> 03:24.790
Your favorite
glee club instructor,

03:24.824 --> 03:28.777
the dreamy and boyish
Mr. Cory Radison!

03:28.828 --> 03:30.662
Oh!

03:30.697 --> 03:33.282
Uh, I thought I told you
to call me Mr. Rad.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.466
Or Cory.

03:34.501 --> 03:35.918
Just don't call me
"late to dinner."

03:35.952 --> 03:37.452
Unless you're serving
brussels sprouts!

03:37.504 --> 03:40.589
I won't, I promise!

03:40.623 --> 03:43.041
This guy's like human froyo.

03:43.076 --> 03:45.878
Look, when the last glee club
died in that bus crash,

03:45.912 --> 03:47.246
you guys stepped up.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.765
And you were the best gosh darn
emergency substitutes

03:49.799 --> 03:50.766
I've ever worked with.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.301
- Aw!
- Well, this time...

03:52.352 --> 03:55.304
I'm not gonna kid you.
I won't be easy.

03:55.355 --> 03:56.655
- Oh!
- Your best...

03:56.689 --> 03:58.490
Won't be good enough.

03:58.525 --> 04:00.959
And ten times your best
will be so bad,

04:00.994 --> 04:03.028
I will yell at you.

04:03.062 --> 04:05.864
But I promise,
if we dig down--

04:05.899 --> 04:07.866
- Pass.
- Yeah.

04:07.901 --> 04:11.203
Okay.

04:11.237 --> 04:13.505
Whew.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.507
Don't you hurt him.

04:16.543 --> 04:17.875
Mr. Rad!

04:17.911 --> 04:19.995
I feel like we let
Mr. Rad down.

04:20.046 --> 04:22.014
No, he let himself down
when he left the house

04:22.048 --> 04:23.582
this morning
wearing a sweater-vest.

04:23.616 --> 04:25.334
I guess we did have fun
last time.

04:25.385 --> 04:27.219
Did we?
I can hardly remember.

04:27.253 --> 04:29.137
It's all a weird, happy,
musical fog.

04:29.172 --> 04:31.023
Yeah, it was almost
like being on ecstasy,

04:31.057 --> 04:33.091
only instead of having
pointless conversations

04:33.125 --> 04:35.177
and dancing like idiots--
wait.

04:35.228 --> 04:37.679
It was exactly
like being on ecstasy!

04:37.730 --> 04:38.864
That's what worries me
about this guy.

04:38.898 --> 04:41.183
He is equal parts hanson
and manson.

04:41.234 --> 04:44.169
Nobody let him corner you until
he is out of recruitment mode,

04:44.203 --> 04:45.604
or next thing you know,

04:45.638 --> 04:48.340
we'll all be caring
about Christmas pageants and...

04:48.374 --> 04:49.324
Regionals.

04:49.359 --> 04:50.359
- You're right, deal.
- Ugh.

04:50.410 --> 04:51.360
- Agreed.
- Got you.

04:51.411 --> 04:53.078
What the hell are regionals?

05:02.538 --> 05:03.922
What are you still doing here?

05:03.957 --> 05:05.791
I thought I'd give her
one more tinkle

05:05.825 --> 05:07.960
before I took down decorations.

05:07.994 --> 05:10.662
No glee club means no pageant,
means no Christmas.

05:10.697 --> 05:12.030
I'm sure trying
to make things brighter

05:12.065 --> 05:13.966
just would've made
more darkness.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.402
That sounds like
a certain ex-lawyer talking.

05:17.437 --> 05:19.771
I see a lot of myself in you,
Abed.

05:19.806 --> 05:21.673
You care about your friends,
and you wish they cared

05:21.708 --> 05:23.108
more about each other.

05:23.142 --> 05:25.394
That's not an easy position
to be in sometimes.

05:25.445 --> 05:26.478
I just want my friends and I

05:26.512 --> 05:27.679
to have
a merry Christmas together.

05:27.714 --> 05:29.214
Well, maybe you could start

05:29.248 --> 05:31.950
by giving them the greatest
Christmas gift of all.

06:58.065 --> 07:00.300

a Jehovah's Witness

to be into Christmas,

08:35.162 --> 08:38.131
if we're gonna go to regionals.

08:38.164 --> 08:39.631
Cool.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.568
I just need to...
Study...

08:41.602 --> 08:43.369
Though...In my room.

08:43.404 --> 08:44.804
So have fun!

08:44.838 --> 08:46.472
And then, this morning,

08:46.506 --> 08:47.640
I could hear them
in the bathroom,

08:47.674 --> 08:49.742
doing
country Western mash-ups.

08:49.777 --> 08:51.544
And they won't stop talking
about regionals!

08:51.579 --> 08:52.812
Maybe it's nothing.

08:52.846 --> 08:54.147
Yeah, if "nothing"
wears a sweater-vest

08:54.181 --> 08:55.698
and seems aggressively asexual.

08:55.733 --> 08:58.351
Come on, let's all study
for our biology final

08:58.385 --> 09:00.069
in our old--

09:00.120 --> 09:02.088
Where's our table?

09:02.122 --> 09:04.891
Who's that guy?

09:04.925 --> 09:06.793
You guys all see him too,
right?

09:06.827 --> 09:08.378
- Hey, guys.
- Merry Christmas, y'all.

09:08.429 --> 09:10.046
Sorry about the rearrangement.

09:10.097 --> 09:11.798
We need this space to rehearse
for the pageant.

09:11.832 --> 09:13.666
But we're not doing
the pageant.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.435
Look, guys,
I hear your negativity,

09:15.469 --> 09:17.203
but also,
can I counter with this?

09:17.238 --> 09:19.005
Who hates glee?

09:19.039 --> 09:20.807
Listen to how that sounds.

09:20.841 --> 09:23.176
Glee literally
means "glee."

09:23.210 --> 09:24.477
Oh, stop it!

09:24.511 --> 09:26.396
Not liking glee club
doesn't make us bullies,

09:26.447 --> 09:28.548
and implying that
is reverse bullying.

09:28.582 --> 09:29.916
Good point.
Sing about it?

09:29.950 --> 09:30.917
No!

09:30.951 --> 09:33.253
I understand them,
but you, Pierce?

09:33.287 --> 09:34.754
Your generation invented music!

09:34.788 --> 09:37.624
I don't know
about "invented."

09:37.658 --> 09:39.692
- Perfected, maybe.
- Pierce!

09:39.710 --> 09:41.561
They're just trying to pander
to your demographics'

09:41.595 --> 09:43.796
well-documented
historical vanity. Resist!

09:43.831 --> 09:45.632
Abed,
wasn't Santa Claus himself

09:45.666 --> 09:46.966
part of Pierce's peer group?

09:47.001 --> 09:49.002
I believe so.

I'm hoping

11:28.652 --> 11:29.969
we can get Shirley or Annie.

So Shirley or Annie

There's a leaf
on Britta's head.

you to rearrange our study room,

in there.

12:01.668 --> 12:03.403
I wish there was a way
we could stop all this.

12:03.437 --> 12:05.805
I mean, I realize the stakes
aren't actually that high,

12:05.839 --> 12:07.707
but somehow, that just
makes it extra scary.

12:07.741 --> 12:08.891
I know.

12:08.942 --> 12:11.527
Jeff, I think I know
what Mr. Rad is up to.

12:11.562 --> 12:15.064
There's something
you have to see.

12:15.115 --> 12:17.483
Mr. Rad plans to get
every single member

12:17.518 --> 12:19.285

to join the glee club.

12:19.319 --> 12:21.354

Also, you're Jewish!

recruiting skills, Abed.

16:07.141 --> 16:08.792
I was happy to do it.
For a while there, I thought

16:08.810 --> 16:11.294
we were gonna end the semester
on a really dark note.

16:11.312 --> 16:12.729
I'm glad we're singing
and dancing together instead.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.064

And it's going to continue

If we win regionals, then it's
straight on to sectionals.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.238
And then a week later is semis.
Then semiregionals.

Yeah!

No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:13.918 --> 18:15.352

another bus crash!

18:18.890 --> 18:22.309
Well, figuratively.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.861
I'm not saying,

18:24.896 --> 18:28.098
"I killed
the last glee club."

18:28.116 --> 18:31.101
I'm saying
you not listening to me

18:31.119 --> 18:35.572
is like metaphorically cutting
the brake lines on your own--

18:35.606 --> 18:38.542
Look, kings of Leon!

18:38.576 --> 18:40.977
What did he say?

18:41.012 --> 18:43.313
Did Mr. Rad
kill the last glee club?

18:43.348 --> 18:45.182
And to think
I trusted him enough

18:45.216 --> 18:48.318
to captain a magic carpet
in that dream I had last night.

18:48.353 --> 18:50.554
Maybe Jeff's right.

18:50.588 --> 18:51.922
Maybe forcing things
to be bright just makes

18:51.956 --> 18:53.323
the darkness underneath
even darker.

18:53.358 --> 18:56.193
This was all my fault for
insisting we do the pageant.

18:56.227 --> 18:58.195
Sorry.

18:58.229 --> 19:00.530
Merry Christmas.

19:00.565 --> 19:04.701
I guess I'll just see you guys
after the holidays.

19:10.808 --> 19:12.642
Happy time day, Reggie.

19:12.660 --> 19:15.078
It is tradition to give
one's constable a gift

19:15.113 --> 19:16.363
at the end
of each orbital cycle.

19:16.414 --> 19:18.048
Oh, thank you, inspector!

19:20.084 --> 19:22.319
- Blimey! A hologram?
- Mm-hmm.

19:22.353 --> 19:23.987

20:05.263 --> 20:06.730
I basically killed a guy.

20:06.764 --> 20:09.532
And I kind of attacked you guys
with a fire axe.

20:09.550 --> 20:10.767
Yeah.

20:10.802 --> 20:12.002
I'm thinking about seeing
a new shrink.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.003

- Don't.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.204
