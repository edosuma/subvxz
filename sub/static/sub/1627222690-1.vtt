<i>This is me.</i>

01:06.397 --> 01:09.701
- Oh, yeah!
- <i>No, not this guy.</i>

01:09.734 --> 01:12.337
Oh, yeah.
Oh, don't stop!

01:13.405 --> 01:15.441
- Oh, my God!
- <i>This guy.</i>

01:15.474 --> 01:16.776
Oh, my God!

01:16.808 --> 01:18.343
Oh, right there!

01:20.778 --> 01:22.081
Oh, yeah!

01:23.549 --> 01:24.784
I... I'm gonna...

01:24.816 --> 01:26.785
<i>I kind of wanted
to freeze to death that day.</i>

01:26.819 --> 01:28.621
Tim Long, no!

01:28.653 --> 01:31.323
<i>I even fantasized
about a headline.</i>

01:31.356 --> 01:33.659
<i>"Teenage Genius Dies
In Blizzard"</i>

01:33.691 --> 01:35.193
<i>But in truth,
I knew my death</i>

01:35.227 --> 01:39.465
<i>would make one paragraph on page 12 at best.</i>

01:39.498 --> 01:42.335
<i>I grew up in what is technically
known among geographers</i>

01:42.367 --> 01:44.336
<i>as the middle
of fucking nowhere,</i>

01:44.370 --> 01:46.873
<i>in a town whose mascot
was this guy.</i>

01:46.906 --> 01:48.708
<i>The white squirrel.</i>

01:48.740 --> 01:52.644
<i>Now, white squirrels have a recessive
gene that makes them super rare...</i>

01:53.646 --> 01:54.680
<i>And super dumb.</i>

01:55.915 --> 01:57.250
<i>And in 1986,</i>

01:57.283 --> 02:00.620
<i>when the town was in the midst
of a crippling recession,</i>

02:00.653 --> 02:02.789
<i>Hobart and the squirrel
had a lot in common.</i>

02:07.793 --> 02:10.362
<i>They were both throwbacks
on the verge of extinction,</i>

02:10.395 --> 02:12.899
<i>struggling to fight off
stronger competitors,</i>

02:12.931 --> 02:14.800
<i>and almost totally white.</i>

02:23.342 --> 02:24.410
Tim, come on!

02:25.544 --> 02:27.680
Yeah, it's tough
for everybody right now.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.816
Did you hear about
Robertson's variety?

02:31.417 --> 02:33.552
You know Doug Robertson,
no head for business.

02:34.286 --> 02:35.555
Tim, Mom's waiting!

02:35.587 --> 02:36.955
That's what you said
about Stedman Shoes

02:36.989 --> 02:39.425
and they've been in business
for 60 years, right?

02:40.758 --> 02:42.561
Hey, buddy!

02:42.895 --> 02:44.164
Hey.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.266
Yeah.

02:47.299 --> 02:49.402
You know, you don't got to go to
the parade meeting with your mom.

02:49.435 --> 02:52.471
You can always head down
to the rink and, uh,

02:52.503 --> 02:55.307
I don't know, hang out
with your friends.

03:04.582 --> 03:06.451
Why'd you have
to mention friends?

03:15.593 --> 03:18.597
I spy with my little eye
something that starts with a C.

03:19.465 --> 03:20.500
Car?

03:21.599 --> 03:22.634
Yeah.

03:24.870 --> 03:27.240
<i>Hobart's annual
white squirrel parade</i>

03:27.272 --> 03:28.508
<i>was the most embarrassing</i>

03:28.540 --> 03:31.843
<i>and culturally cringeworthy
event imaginable...</i>

03:31.877 --> 03:33.445
<i>Unless you are four years old,</i>

03:33.479 --> 03:36.482
<i>or Kevin,
the parade organizer.</i>

03:36.514 --> 03:40.018
Come with me, if you will,

03:40.051 --> 03:41.586
on a...

03:41.620 --> 03:42.855
On a journey

03:42.888 --> 03:45.591
- through the mists of time.
- Whoa.

03:45.623 --> 03:48.728
Let the years roll back
before your eyes.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.296
The '70s
turn into the '60s.

03:52.764 --> 03:53.898
Groovy.

03:53.931 --> 03:55.367
Right on.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.237
The '50s, Elvis...

03:58.971 --> 04:00.772
The '40s, Korea...

04:02.040 --> 04:04.509
Back and back
and back we go...

04:05.843 --> 04:07.746
It's 1939.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.484
The Nazis are cutting
a swath through Europe.

04:11.516 --> 04:14.419
Jews and gypsies are
murdered indiscriminately.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.021
Ooh.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.490
And the Toronto Maple Leafs have
won their second Stanley Cup.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.026
Yeah!

04:20.059 --> 04:21.394
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

04:22.394 --> 04:24.930
I propose this year,

04:24.963 --> 04:28.801
we recreate Hobart's
very first

04:29.600 --> 04:30.937
white squirrel parade.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.939
I'm sorry,
why are there Nazis?

04:34.973 --> 04:36.942
There won't be
actual Nazis,

04:36.975 --> 04:38.811
it was just
for historical context.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.314
Um, before we commit
to any one theme,

04:41.346 --> 04:43.915
we should maybe
look at cost.

04:43.949 --> 04:45.651
Cut back a little.

04:45.684 --> 04:46.919
Hell, no.

04:49.855 --> 04:51.991
You know who cuts corners
on their town fairs?

04:54.560 --> 04:55.593
Wingham.

04:55.627 --> 04:57.562
I think that Sheila
has a point.

04:57.596 --> 04:59.598
I mean,
money is so tight these days.

04:59.630 --> 05:03.001
Maybe we can cut back
on the snow removal,

05:03.035 --> 05:05.071
or the daycare hours
at the old folks home.

05:05.103 --> 05:07.673
But what about the theme?
Retro vintage!

05:07.706 --> 05:10.710
Okay, I think that the parade is
really important to a lot of people.

05:10.742 --> 05:12.844
So, why don't we just all
put our thinking caps on

05:12.877 --> 05:14.713
and, uh,
we'll discuss it next week.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.449
I tell you what,
why don't we put our thinking caps on,

05:17.483 --> 05:18.817
just discuss it
next week.

05:18.850 --> 05:21.353
I know the parade is really
important to everyone.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.922
- That's a great idea, Gary.
- Thank you.

05:25.057 --> 05:26.959
<i>While my schoolmates
were at the rink,</i>

05:26.992 --> 05:29.995
<i>I sought solace in the company
of our Town Hall janitor.</i>

05:30.028 --> 05:31.364
Hello.

05:31.396 --> 05:32.731
I, uh,
couldn't decide between

05:32.764 --> 05:35.634
<i>Yojimbo, Subway</i>
and <i>La Dolce Vita,</i>

05:36.601 --> 05:38.070
so I brought
them all.

05:39.538 --> 05:41.574
What was that again?

05:41.607 --> 05:43.109
You told me you'd bought
a VCR player,

05:43.141 --> 05:45.877
so I thought I'd bring
some movies.

05:45.911 --> 05:47.713
I don't care much
for movies.

05:47.745 --> 05:48.880
Right, sure.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.783
But, in case you change
your mind,

05:50.815 --> 05:53.151
I'm gonna leave
these here.

05:53.185 --> 05:55.120
Movies from all around
the world,

05:55.153 --> 05:56.788
including one
from Korea.

05:56.822 --> 06:00.158
I shot my best friend
in Korea.

06:00.192 --> 06:02.394
Used his body
for shelter.

06:04.696 --> 06:06.732
Okay.

06:06.764 --> 06:09.668
I... I didn't know that, I'm sorry.
I'll take that one out.

06:10.569 --> 06:11.838
Farewell,
<i>The Housemaid.</i>

06:13.071 --> 06:15.675
There's a tampon blocking
the drain pipe.

06:16.908 --> 06:18.377
I'll see you later.

06:19.644 --> 06:21.079
Yeah, okay.

06:22.781 --> 06:24.182
Good luck
with the, uh...

06:24.216 --> 06:26.119
Good luck with the...
With the tampon.

06:29.221 --> 06:31.423
You were really
impressive in there, Gary.

06:31.456 --> 06:33.024
You have such
a way with words.

06:33.057 --> 06:35.528
Thank you for keeping
Tim company.

06:36.661 --> 06:38.062
Careful,
it's the Crowfoots.

06:38.096 --> 06:39.564
What can I do
for you, sir?

06:39.598 --> 06:40.633
Gun permit.

06:40.665 --> 06:42.535
- Downstairs to the left...
- Oops! Sorry!

06:43.935 --> 06:45.937
I heard the sister
doesn't even talk.

06:46.737 --> 06:47.906
Hi, Tim Long!

06:47.939 --> 06:49.975
Look, same sweater!

06:52.478 --> 06:53.512
See?

07:02.120 --> 07:03.456
Hey, Long.

07:03.488 --> 07:04.589
How's your book?

07:05.824 --> 07:07.627
Uh, it's...
It's not a book,

07:08.093 --> 07:09.028
it's a magazine.

07:09.060 --> 07:12.097
Yeah? Are you gonna fuck it?

07:13.966 --> 07:15.835
How exactly
would I do that?

07:15.867 --> 07:17.670
I don't know, man,
you're the one who's gay.

07:19.904 --> 07:21.873
Why is the magazine
a man?

07:25.110 --> 07:28.547
Dude, Fleming's coming.
We gotta go.

<i>Quel est ton film prefere?</i>

07:56.875 --> 07:59.845
<i>Le Cercle Rouge

08:01.612 --> 08:03.048
What is the story?

08:03.615 --> 08:04.750
Um...

08:08.185 --> 08:09.721
Wait, hold on.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.591
I just wanna
talk to you about

08:12.624 --> 08:16.161
this France-Canada
exchange program.

08:16.194 --> 08:19.265
This is a really great way
to expand your horizons.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.165
A super-duper way
to make friends,

08:21.199 --> 08:24.136
learn about the world,
make sure your parents see this, too.

08:24.168 --> 08:26.170
<i>Attention,

- <i>Monsieur</i> Long, continue.
- Please, no more.

08:44.188 --> 08:45.557

Perhaps
you can bring it in

09:04.942 --> 09:06.678

Oh, and, uh,
just one more thing.

- My hearing?
- Yeah.

09:46.418 --> 09:47.686
It's good.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.356
You didn't respond to the, uh,
joke about the Pope in the dress.

09:51.389 --> 09:54.994
Yeah, well,
you make that one a lot, so...

- Steve Dalrymple?

He was that kid who
moved here from Manitoba?

14:10.981 --> 14:12.884
<i>I'm here, uh, with Tim Long,</i>

14:12.918 --> 14:15.120
<i>awaiting the arrival
of a young man from Paris.</i>

14:15.153 --> 14:16.455
<i>Tell our viewers
how you're feeling.</i>

14:16.488 --> 14:18.123
<i>Can we stop, please?
This guy's from Europe.</i>

14:18.157 --> 14:21.393
<i>He's gonna be sophisticated and
smart and worldly, and he's...</i>

14:21.426 --> 14:25.097
- <i>He's not gonna like it.</i>
- <i>Oh, Tim, are we embarrassing you?</i>

14:31.001 --> 14:32.336
<i>Jesus.</i>

14:32.370 --> 14:33.672
- <i>Huh.</i>
- <i>Well...</i>

14:36.240 --> 14:40.144
<i>Um, this is Sheila Long,</i>
Long Family News, <i>the airport.</i>

14:40.177 --> 14:43.081
- <i>I thought it was fun.</i>
- <i>God, this thing weighs a ton.</i>

14:43.114 --> 14:45.984
They don't tell you that on the box,
or how much the goddamn tapes cost.

14:46.017 --> 14:48.987
- Oh, expensive.
- Come on. Save me.

15:04.101 --> 15:05.169
Hey.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.644
<i>Allo,</i> Tim.

15:39.437 --> 15:40.605
<i>Allo,</i> Tim Long.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.508
What?

15:43.541 --> 15:46.545
I am your exchange partner,
Stephane Belmadi. Eh?

15:48.078 --> 15:49.246
What do you mean?

15:49.279 --> 15:50.848
- <i>For Tim Long?</i>
- <i>Glenn, you getting this?</i>

15:50.881 --> 15:53.718
- <i>I actually have no idea...</i>
- <i>Get in there. Zoom in.</i>

15:53.751 --> 15:55.519
...if this is on
or not, but...

15:55.552 --> 15:57.422
- And you must be Glenn?
- Yeah.

15:57.455 --> 15:59.091
- Well, <i>bonjour.</i>
- Hello.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.658
- I think there's a mix-up.
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

16:02.192 --> 16:04.196
Wow, Sheila. A beauty.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.263
<i>Whoa!</i>

16:05.296 --> 16:06.264
- <i>Ah.</i>
- <i>Enchantee.</i>

16:06.297 --> 16:08.500
<i>So beautiful.</i>

16:08.533 --> 16:09.634
<i>Three times.</i>

16:10.534 --> 16:12.570
Long family.

16:12.604 --> 16:15.674
So, Stephane, um,
our car is in the...

16:21.111 --> 16:22.246
Just, uh...

16:24.416 --> 16:26.085
- Give him the word.
- Yeah.

16:28.452 --> 16:30.121
Should've
dog-eared this.

16:31.556 --> 16:33.191
It's masculine.

16:33.224 --> 16:34.793
<i>Okay, then. Mix-up?</i>

16:34.826 --> 16:37.528
<i>I just... I get stuck on
that. Hang on.</i>

16:39.563 --> 16:41.065
It was here earlier.

16:42.299 --> 16:45.269
Okay, <i>"le parking."</i>
Same word. Same word.

16:45.302 --> 16:47.105
<i>Let's go.</i>

16:47.138 --> 16:49.141
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.

16:50.207 --> 16:51.543
Now, it's a bit of a drive.

16:51.576 --> 16:53.445
Stephane, do you need to use
the little boys' room?

16:54.778 --> 16:57.249
<i>You crazy boy. Come on.</i>

17:07.392 --> 17:08.692
Whoa.

17:08.726 --> 17:10.496
- Ah, cow.
- Mmm.

17:11.462 --> 17:12.829
- Seelo.
- Silo.

17:12.864 --> 17:15.034
<i>Oui.</i> Mmm-hmm.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.336
- Silo.
- Oh, yeah.

17:18.367 --> 17:19.369
And, uh...

17:20.204 --> 17:21.807
Uh, cow.

17:23.708 --> 17:24.710
Uh...

17:25.777 --> 17:27.211
- House.
- Yeah.

17:27.243 --> 17:28.412
- <i>Oui?</i>
- Oh, yeah.

17:28.444 --> 17:30.714
Cow.

17:30.748 --> 17:34.853
Uh, yeah. No.
Yeah, we live in a very agricultural area,

17:34.885 --> 17:37.088
so a lot of cow.

17:37.122 --> 17:40.392
Before I come here, people say,
"Why you go Canada? It's so boring."

17:40.424 --> 17:42.760
But for me it's <i>tres bien.</i>

17:42.794 --> 17:44.196
Big wow for Canada, huh.

17:44.729 --> 17:45.797
Really?

17:45.829 --> 17:47.865
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

17:47.898 --> 17:52.236
The people who say
that Canada is shit USA,

17:52.269 --> 17:55.273
these people are,
uh, how you say...

17:56.840 --> 17:57.875
Motherfucker.

17:57.909 --> 17:59.578
- Oh. Oh.
- You say this?

17:59.611 --> 18:01.179
- We don't.
- Motherfucker, huh?

18:01.211 --> 18:03.682
That's a word we don't use
in the Long household.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.750
Yes, they are, Stephane.
That's exactly what they are.

18:05.782 --> 18:07.118
- Motherfuckers.
- Oh.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.221
<i>Tres bien.</i>

18:12.656 --> 18:19.463
Stephane, I notice that,
uh, you're not... You don't look French.

18:19.497 --> 18:22.534
- Dad, I don't think that's...
- Oh. No, he's fine.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.769
My family was not
born in France,

18:24.801 --> 18:28.406
but I live Paris, uh,
since I was three years old.

18:33.644 --> 18:36.448
- Are you... Are wearing cologne?
- <i>Oui, oui.</i>

18:36.480 --> 18:39.518
You know the saying, before sex
can happen in the pants,

18:39.550 --> 18:41.220
it must first happen
in the nose.

18:43.922 --> 18:46.458
In the nose. Okay.

18:46.490 --> 18:47.859
I didn't know that.
Thank you.

18:50.194 --> 18:51.328
Uh, no. No, thank you.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.653
This is it.
All right. Here we are.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.488
<i>Chez</i> Long.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.455
Huh?

19:18.489 --> 19:20.325
You did not say
you live in a palace.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.495
How many families
live here?

19:23.528 --> 19:24.730
Just us, Stephane.

19:27.298 --> 19:28.333
Huh.

19:28.365 --> 19:29.468
Wow.

19:33.471 --> 19:34.605
Big wow.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.410
Well, um,
this is your room, so...

19:38.442 --> 19:39.810
This is all me?

19:39.844 --> 19:42.380
Yeah. No, it's all you.

19:42.413 --> 19:45.884
Wow. Big wow.

19:45.916 --> 19:49.221
Yeah. Used to be, uh,
kinda my private retreat.

19:49.253 --> 19:51.589
Where I'd get away
from it all. Uh...

19:51.623 --> 19:53.725
It's all yours now,
so you're welcome.

19:54.558 --> 19:55.961
These are your friends?

19:55.993 --> 19:58.929
- My... No, no, not my friends.
- They look sad.

19:58.962 --> 20:00.965
- Uh, they're The Smiths.
- Huh?

20:00.999 --> 20:04.336
Great new band out of England.
Very smart, very cool...

20:04.368 --> 20:05.569
You know,
I don't like this.

20:05.603 --> 20:07.639
I like, uh, you know, hip-hop?

20:07.672 --> 20:08.973
Sure, yeah, okay.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.543
Actually, I read a great
article about how rap...

20:11.576 --> 20:12.978
<i>♪ Don't push me</i>

20:13.010 --> 20:14.546
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm close
to the edge</i>

20:14.578 --> 20:16.347
Okay. Yeah.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.718
<i>♪ I'm trying
not to lose my head ♪</i>

20:19.750 --> 20:23.254
Yeah. No. Maybe not the vase.

20:23.288 --> 20:26.524
Very delicate.
My nana bought me that from Venice.

20:26.557 --> 20:28.460
- Pop that there.
- Hello.

20:28.492 --> 20:29.994
You boys getting along?

20:30.795 --> 20:32.364
We are <i>meilleurs copains.</i>

20:32.396 --> 20:33.764
- Yeah.
- Best friends.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.433
- Aww...
- Yeah.

20:36.467 --> 20:38.803
- Yeah, it's going great.
- I can see that.

20:38.836 --> 20:43.008
I brought you something.
It's called a bean bag chair.

20:45.042 --> 20:46.710
It's full of beans, like me.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.384
- She very funny.
- Yes. Yeah, very funny, Mom.

20:52.416 --> 20:53.417
I'll leave you to it.

20:55.519 --> 20:57.256
Tell you something, Tim.

20:58.623 --> 21:00.491
This is my best life.

21:01.392 --> 21:02.394
Lot of fun.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.529
Lot of fun.

21:06.396 --> 21:08.932
Well, uh, the couch folds out
into a bed,

21:08.965 --> 21:12.036
so you can feel free to get
on that, watch some movies.

21:12.069 --> 21:14.371
TV here is great. Records.

21:14.404 --> 21:15.840
- Hey, Tim. Tim.
- Music. Yeah.

21:16.941 --> 21:18.777
Soft like a woman, huh?

21:18.809 --> 21:20.845
- Oh, yeah.
- Like this?

21:20.877 --> 21:23.814
<i>Comme ca? Comme ca.</i>

21:23.847 --> 21:26.684
- Huh?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do some of that.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.452
- Like this? Leg up?
- Oh.

21:28.486 --> 21:29.653
Yeah.

21:29.686 --> 21:31.423
That's great, yeah.

21:31.455 --> 21:32.923
Maybe like this, no hands?

21:32.957 --> 21:35.360
Oh! Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

21:35.393 --> 21:37.596
- Yes.
- Yeah, up and down.

21:38.796 --> 21:40.398
- Perfect.
- You try it now.

21:40.431 --> 21:42.600
- No.
- Soft like woman.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.936
Yeah. Or like a...
Lile a big old marshmallow.

21:49.840 --> 21:50.908
Like a marshmallow.

21:55.613 --> 21:56.847
Good.

21:56.881 --> 21:59.017
Yeah, it's a lot of fun. Yeah.

22:01.551 --> 22:03.654
Stephane, school is at 8:30.

22:04.955 --> 22:08.425
I am already ready. Huh?

22:08.459 --> 22:11.663
Already ready. Already ready.
This is fun to say, eh?

22:11.695 --> 22:13.698
Bring the milk.
Toast on the table.

22:16.166 --> 22:19.503
Am I crazy, or are his pants
totally diaphanous?

22:19.537 --> 22:21.840
- Dia-what?
- They're see-through. His pants are...

22:23.074 --> 22:24.676
- Dad.
- Hello.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.413
Morning, boys.
Who wants French toast?

22:29.446 --> 22:31.982
Or I guess you would just call it toast.

22:33.718 --> 22:35.420
Mmm. Hmm.

22:35.452 --> 22:37.556
Glenn, I would like
to tell you,

22:38.588 --> 22:39.957
you are so smart

22:40.825 --> 22:43.761
and so success, huh.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.898
You are, and Sheila, wow,
you are so beautiful.

22:46.931 --> 22:48.066
- Huh.
- Oh!

22:48.098 --> 22:50.368
- Yeah.
- Corn Flakes, please.

22:55.740 --> 22:56.775
Hmm...

22:59.544 --> 23:02.080
Maybe you should
change your pants,

23:02.113 --> 23:04.950
because you can see right
through them.

23:06.550 --> 23:08.986
- Can you really?
- Not at all.

23:09.019 --> 23:11.455
- Whole outfit's terrific.
- Yeah, it's great.

23:11.489 --> 23:13.424
- It's very chic.
- Very smart.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.826
<i>I talked Stephane
into changing his trousers,</i>

23:15.859 --> 23:18.128
<i>but I couldn't change him.</i>

23:18.162 --> 23:20.766
<i>I dreaded walking to school
with him that first day.</i>

23:22.633 --> 23:24.836
This place is like, uh...
What is that movie?

23:24.868 --> 23:26.570
Uh, <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

23:27.904 --> 23:29.840
Trust me,
inside it's a nightmare.

23:29.874 --> 23:30.975
What?
What nightmare?

23:31.008 --> 23:34.045
Hello, teachers.
Hello, fellow pupils.

23:34.077 --> 23:36.847
Hello, girl with
the pink hat on.

23:36.881 --> 23:40.051
- I love this school. I go this school now.
- Yeah.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.687
Please stop speaking.

23:44.521 --> 23:47.858
Boys, I don't know
what a cooch-gobbler even is...

23:47.892 --> 23:50.061
...but I'm pretty sure that

23:50.094 --> 23:53.030
Mrs. McConnell doesn't want it
scrawled all over her Subaru.

23:54.231 --> 23:55.599
Stephane, Mrs. Fleming.

23:55.633 --> 23:58.836
- <i>Allo.</i>
- Oh, oh.

23:58.869 --> 24:01.572
- Uh, that's the vice principal.
- Ah.

24:01.605 --> 24:03.540
And she also teaches French.

24:03.574 --> 24:05.977
And she, um,
is more or less mayor.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.212
Whoa! She very important, ah?

24:08.246 --> 24:10.915
No. Not really.
It's just Hobart, so...

24:10.948 --> 24:12.717
Uh, here.
That's his paperwork.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.652
I'll get out of your hair.
See you.

24:14.684 --> 24:17.221
Boys,
I'll see you at lunch.

24:17.255 --> 24:19.791
Bye, cool guys.
I go this school now.

24:21.858 --> 24:23.861
We're glad you're here,
Stephane.

24:23.894 --> 24:25.262
Um...

24:25.296 --> 24:27.198
I know you had
a bit of a rough time at home,

24:27.230 --> 24:30.734
but you can start with a clean
slate here at Hobart High.

24:30.768 --> 24:33.238
It's good, huh.
Hobart are number one.

24:33.270 --> 24:36.007
Oh, go, the fighting white squirrel.

24:39.676 --> 24:40.878
<i>Salut.</i>

24:40.912 --> 24:42.614
You are
a teacher here?

24:42.646 --> 24:45.649
Oh. No. Well, not yet.

24:48.452 --> 24:51.722
Well, I've applied to teacher's college,
and I'm still waiting to hear back.

24:51.756 --> 24:53.225
It's kind of a long story.

24:57.094 --> 24:58.096
Okay.

24:59.029 --> 25:00.065
<i>Allo.</i>

25:00.897 --> 25:02.165
Begin.

25:02.199 --> 25:04.302
Oh, um...

25:04.335 --> 25:06.938
Well, uh...

25:06.971 --> 25:12.609
I had the best teacher in kindergarten,
Mrs. Johannson, and she was just so kind

25:12.643 --> 25:14.979
and really like a second mom
to me in a lot of ways.

25:15.011 --> 25:16.513
That's 'cause her
real mom left town,

25:16.547 --> 25:20.617
and things got tough, and her dad
started hitting the sauce pretty hard,

25:20.651 --> 25:22.887
and she was forced to move in
with her auntie across town,

25:22.920 --> 25:26.124
which basically made her
mega-into teachers, which,

25:26.156 --> 25:28.659
of course, is good for me.

25:28.692 --> 25:31.261
Sorry, honey,
just saving us a lot of time.

25:31.295 --> 25:36.634
Gary, um, this is Stephane,
he is the exchange student from France.

25:36.666 --> 25:39.069
Sure, why wouldn't he be?
Gary Rothbauer.

25:39.103 --> 25:40.337
Gary's a gym teacher.

25:40.371 --> 25:41.306
Hmm.

25:41.338 --> 25:44.308
- Gary's also the local law enforcement.
- Mmm.

25:44.342 --> 25:45.243
Part-time.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.345
Um, the real sheriff's
based in Wingham.

25:47.377 --> 25:48.378
Wingham's 20 miles away,

25:48.413 --> 25:51.782
so shit hits the fan,
I'm the first responder.

25:51.816 --> 25:54.218
I also teach skating,
hockey, and soccer.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.054
You play soccer here?

25:56.086 --> 25:57.288
Does the Pope wear a dress?

25:57.320 --> 25:59.790
He does.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.625
Yes, he does.

26:02.292 --> 26:03.327
Really?

26:03.361 --> 26:04.896
Huh?

26:04.929 --> 26:07.699
See? International.
My jokes are international.

26:07.731 --> 26:10.367
May not look like it,
but he's one of us. Huh?

26:10.401 --> 26:13.738
I like this guy. All right.
Listen, word to the wise.

26:15.772 --> 26:17.708
- Oh.
- Oh.

26:17.741 --> 26:19.610
Uh, just leave it.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.278
You may hear
people talking about

26:21.311 --> 26:24.247
me being the greatest hockey player
to ever come out of this town.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.849
Played in pro-hockey, son.

26:25.883 --> 26:28.853
Power forward, 15 games.

26:28.885 --> 26:32.990
But the coach was an arsehole,
and who needs all the travel?

26:35.425 --> 26:36.627
I love soccer.

26:37.361 --> 26:40.865
I scored 20 goals
in 20 games.

26:40.897 --> 26:42.132
- Wow.
- Not bad.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.269
Not bad at all.

26:45.368 --> 26:48.105
If you wanna play,
practice is at 2:00.

26:48.138 --> 26:49.773
- You can try for the team.
- <i>Oui?</i>

26:49.807 --> 26:52.043
Now, I'm firm, but I'm fair,

26:53.210 --> 26:56.314
and, uh, I don't see color.

26:57.815 --> 26:59.750
Oh, no.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.020
You should,
uh, go see the doctor.

27:02.053 --> 27:03.154
- Why?
- Stephane.

27:05.088 --> 27:07.791
Bye-bye. See you.
- Bye.

27:07.825 --> 27:09.227
Goodbye, queen of the office.

27:12.797 --> 27:13.731
Sweet kid.

27:15.865 --> 27:18.670
- Copier's out of paper.
- Sure, I'll get on that.

27:20.037 --> 27:23.040
<i>I had absolutely no idea
what to expect</i>

27:23.074 --> 27:24.942
<i>from Stephane's first day
at Hobart High.</i>

27:25.742 --> 27:26.910
<i>How he'd make out.</i>

27:26.943 --> 27:29.312
<i>Who would he antagonize?
What would he hump?</i>

27:37.020 --> 27:38.990
<i>But what
I didn't expect was this.</i>

27:47.498 --> 27:50.168
<i>He joined more
sports teams than me, one...</i>

27:55.372 --> 27:57.307
<i>And made more friends than me.</i>

27:57.340 --> 28:00.344
<i>So, it was infuriating.</i>

28:09.519 --> 28:12.889
And I had the idea for
<i>Star Wars</i> way before it came out.

28:12.923 --> 28:14.157
There was no point in pursuing.

28:14.191 --> 28:15.994
Lose all the money
to lawyers and...

28:19.262 --> 28:21.231
And the lion spots his prey

28:22.266 --> 28:23.401
and moves in for the kill.

28:24.268 --> 28:26.237
Come on, Gary, I'm tired.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.971
Maybe we can go...

28:29.440 --> 28:30.842
Woof yourself.

28:32.209 --> 28:34.211
- Dick.
- I'll just wait here.

28:36.012 --> 28:37.014
Oh, jeez.

28:38.182 --> 28:40.084
Is that nubuck, hmm?

28:40.116 --> 28:41.752
- No.
- Sure it is.

28:43.086 --> 28:44.454
You gotta work with me here.

28:44.488 --> 28:45.623
Gary, I'm dying here.

28:45.655 --> 28:48.492
You're dying? What is this,
a shoe store or Live Aid?

28:48.526 --> 28:49.961
I have a family to feed.

28:49.993 --> 28:51.795
They're only $20.

28:51.828 --> 28:52.830
Look at that.

28:55.132 --> 28:56.868
That's not good.

28:56.901 --> 29:00.772
I'll give you 16 because I like
you. I'm doing you a favor.

29:05.576 --> 29:07.478
Make it 12.
I'll give you 12.

29:07.510 --> 29:10.380
And, uh,
you got any other colors?

29:10.413 --> 29:12.750
I'm not taking
the floor model.

29:15.019 --> 29:16.120
I'll check.

29:16.153 --> 29:17.355
Thank you, Robbie.

29:17.387 --> 29:19.456
You drive a hard bargain.

29:19.490 --> 29:22.026
Your dad'll be proud.

29:22.058 --> 29:23.394
How's your day?

29:23.426 --> 29:25.896
Pfft! Ooh la la,
it's not so easy.

29:27.163 --> 29:29.999
Oh. Really?

29:30.034 --> 29:32.903
- Why?
- Well, everyone wants to talk to me.

29:32.936 --> 29:37.574
"Stephane. Come sit with me."
"Stephane, you're so cool."

29:37.607 --> 29:39.476
Come to my house,
watch T.J. Hooker.

29:39.509 --> 29:42.346
My head is pfft!
It's crazy, huh.

29:42.378 --> 29:44.881
- You know this problem?
- Sure.

29:44.914 --> 29:47.018
Real dilemma.

29:48.117 --> 29:49.153
Is that Diane?

29:49.185 --> 29:51.555
<i>Bonjour,</i> Diane.

29:51.588 --> 29:54.258
Oh, uh... I don't speak...
Sorry.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.425
- Um...
- Huh?

29:58.229 --> 30:00.498
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:00.530 --> 30:01.566
No, no, no.

30:08.038 --> 30:08.972
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:09.006 --> 30:12.043
Mr. Steadman, are you alive?
He's dead.

30:12.076 --> 30:13.544
- Are you alive. He's alive. Okay.
- Is he dead?

30:13.576 --> 30:14.377
Can you say
something, please?

30:14.411 --> 30:16.180
Oh, my gosh,
Mr. Steadman.

30:16.212 --> 30:17.347
I'm fine.

30:17.381 --> 30:19.217
- Thank you so much.
- Here, let me help you.

30:19.250 --> 30:23.119
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me.

30:23.153 --> 30:24.255
What's going on?

30:24.288 --> 30:26.057
Stephane here
just saved my life.

30:26.089 --> 30:28.326
Oh, no, it's,
uh, nothing.

30:28.358 --> 30:30.327
No, you did. Thank you.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.530
Nine and a half.

30:35.098 --> 30:39.002
<i>That night my parents wanted
to reward Stephane for his heroism</i>

30:39.036 --> 30:41.138
<i>by showing him
the best of Canadian cuisine.</i>

30:41.171 --> 30:43.374
- It's so good.
- <i>So, we went for a Chinese meal.</i>

30:43.406 --> 30:46.977
In France, this meal
costs one millions dollar.

30:47.010 --> 30:49.212
- Canada, too.
- Oh.

30:49.246 --> 30:52.016
Hey, there he is.

30:52.316 --> 30:53.351
Herb DeVries.

30:53.384 --> 30:54.551
Stephane Belmadi.

30:54.585 --> 30:56.086
Is that right?

30:56.119 --> 30:57.221
How do you pronounce that?

30:57.253 --> 30:59.122
Stephane Bermady.

31:01.191 --> 31:02.593
No.

31:02.625 --> 31:08.365
So, uh, I heard you saved poor
little Diane Dearling's life today.

31:08.398 --> 31:09.633
Oh, no, no, no.
It's nothing.

31:09.666 --> 31:12.102
<i>Bonjour,</i> hero of the hour.

31:12.135 --> 31:15.205
<i>Bonjour. Enchante...</i>

31:18.409 --> 31:21.379
Sheila,
can I bend your ear for a sec?

31:21.412 --> 31:24.981
Hello, anybody notice
we're eating here?

31:25.015 --> 31:29.387
You know, I've made a lot of progress
with our retro-vintage theme.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.422
Kev, you know,
I love it when you think big.

31:31.454 --> 31:34.893
I just think that, you know, we need a
theme that's a little closer to home.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.529
- Okay.
- Sorry. Not to hurt your feelings.

31:39.563 --> 31:41.566
- No. I can respect that.
- I'm sorry.

31:50.273 --> 31:53.243
Lightbulb alert. Stephane.

31:55.546 --> 31:58.682
Our theme is Stephane.

31:58.715 --> 32:01.985
Wait. You want the theme of the
parade to be Stephane?

32:02.486 --> 32:04.689
He's been here three days.

32:04.721 --> 32:06.423
Lorna, come over
and hear Kev's new plan.

32:06.457 --> 32:11.162
Well, not Stephane,
but Stephane.

32:11.627 --> 32:12.628
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

32:12.663 --> 32:16.032
- Who he is. What he represents.
- Yeah.

32:16.066 --> 32:20.538
- Hobart welcomes the world.
- Yeah.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.307
International friendship!

32:23.339 --> 32:24.574
Yeah, that could work.

32:24.607 --> 32:26.543
- Eggrolls for everyone.
- Whoo!

32:26.576 --> 32:28.045
- Oh!
- Yeah!

32:28.077 --> 32:30.513
- Thanks, Glenn.
- Thank you.

32:49.298 --> 32:53.037
You know
who should join you? Dr. Moe.

32:54.137 --> 32:56.206
- Dr. Moe, the town dentist.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.275
Moe!

32:59.209 --> 33:00.278
Moe!

33:01.278 --> 33:02.279
Moe, look!

33:03.247 --> 33:05.282
- Huh?
- Huh?

33:05.315 --> 33:07.418
Where are you from, again?

33:07.451 --> 33:11.322
- Ottawa.
- No, he means where you're from-from?

33:12.423 --> 33:15.625
I was born in Egypt, but moved
when I was an infant.

33:15.659 --> 33:17.495
That's great.

33:17.528 --> 33:22.333
Stephane, you can be France
and Dr. Moe can be... Africa.

33:22.365 --> 33:24.201
No fucking way.

33:25.068 --> 33:27.238
Can you go talk to him
because...

33:27.270 --> 33:29.706
I need both of you and he gets a
little moody and won't listen to me.

33:29.740 --> 33:32.043
Hey!
I can still hear you.

33:32.076 --> 33:34.545
He can still hear us
so just nod.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.446
Jesus!
This fucking town.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.115
That was great, eh?

33:38.749 --> 33:40.351
Oh, careful, honey.

33:42.086 --> 33:45.389
Do you know the English word,
grapefruit, huh?

33:45.422 --> 33:49.326
In French we have a word,
we call it a <i>pamplemousse.</i>

33:52.195 --> 33:55.365
<i>Pamplemousse</i> is a funny word, huh?

33:55.398 --> 33:59.536
Tim, I know he isn't,
uh, what you expected.

33:59.569 --> 34:01.838
Yeah. Understatement.

34:01.872 --> 34:04.375
Give it time. You know,
relationships can be tricky.

34:04.407 --> 34:05.509
I understand that.

34:05.542 --> 34:08.679
It's like a garden,
with attention and cultivation,

34:08.710 --> 34:09.813
good things can grow.

34:09.847 --> 34:12.216
We only got six egg rolls,

34:12.248 --> 34:14.818
- but you're charging us for eight.
- But if you look...

34:14.851 --> 34:15.652
Glenn.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.688
You see,
you have extra.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.730
So, this is, uh,
your favorite movie?

34:27.331 --> 34:29.800
Oh, one of them. Yeah.

34:31.367 --> 34:33.471
Yeah. Plus, it's French.

34:33.503 --> 34:34.806
- So, you know...
- I see that.

34:38.876 --> 34:43.281
- We don't have to watch it.
- No, it's, uh... It's fine.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.851
Maybe, uh,
we just sit and talk, huh?

34:47.885 --> 34:49.754
One to other, asking questions.

34:50.621 --> 34:53.690
- Yeah. Okay. Sure.
- Mmm.

34:54.858 --> 34:58.229
Um, okay, well...

34:58.862 --> 35:01.331
Tell me about Paris.
What's it like?

35:01.364 --> 35:04.234
Old. How many times
you make the fuck, Tim?

35:06.302 --> 35:09.306
- What?
- Two times? Three times?

35:09.338 --> 35:12.476
Five times? Twenty-five times,
you dirty boy, huh?

35:12.509 --> 35:13.878
- Busy boy.
- Please!

35:13.911 --> 35:16.480
Can you tell me
anything about Paris?

35:16.512 --> 35:19.616
Just tell me about the Louvre,
the Champs-Elysees, anything.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.186
That is tourist Paris.

35:23.653 --> 35:25.222
It's, uh, not my Paris.

35:29.458 --> 35:30.827
My Paris is not so great.

35:34.331 --> 35:35.432
Oh.

35:36.333 --> 35:38.869
So, uh, tomorrow we meet
your friends, huh?

35:39.869 --> 35:42.873
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
I don't know, we'll see.

35:45.775 --> 35:47.777
Maybe we'll watch
a different movie.

35:48.478 --> 35:49.880
- Sure. Okay.
- <i>Oui.</i>

35:50.681 --> 35:52.250
Let's do that. Yeah. Okay.

35:52.949 --> 35:54.417
Oh.

35:54.452 --> 35:58.222
If it's French, I warn you,
I've probably already seen it.

35:58.255 --> 35:59.257
It is French.

36:02.992 --> 36:05.462
Oh.

36:08.398 --> 36:09.900
Uh...

36:09.932 --> 36:11.568
You travel
with your own porn?

36:13.603 --> 36:15.906
Yes, and, uh, toothpaste.

36:18.608 --> 36:19.876
It's good, huh?

36:23.981 --> 36:27.518
- I think I'm gonna go to bed.
- Why?

36:27.550 --> 36:29.420
Why? You don't like this movie?

36:29.452 --> 36:31.422
No. I just, uh...

36:31.454 --> 36:33.391
I don't think that would
happen in a courthouse.

36:37.893 --> 36:39.929
That was a fun night, huh?

36:39.963 --> 36:42.298
Gosh, I thought
that was such a great idea

36:42.331 --> 36:45.868
about involving Stephane
in the parade.

36:45.902 --> 36:47.972
Mmm-hmm.

36:53.844 --> 36:55.378
- Glenn.
- Yeah.

36:56.512 --> 36:57.514
- Glenn?
- Yeah.

36:58.282 --> 36:59.917
Kev's idea,

36:59.949 --> 37:02.452
"Hobart welcomes the world."
It's not bad, huh?

37:02.485 --> 37:04.254
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

37:05.355 --> 37:06.423
- Glenn...
- Yeah.

37:06.456 --> 37:07.992
It'll cost, though.

37:08.025 --> 37:11.327
You know, we might need some
more money from the community.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.931
I'm not... I don't know how
to ask people right now.

37:13.963 --> 37:17.268
I just think the times are...
What? What?

37:18.001 --> 37:20.304
- Is there moisturizer on my lips?
- No. No.

37:20.336 --> 37:24.474
Your eyes look...
Really pretty right now.

37:24.507 --> 37:27.244
Oh. That's nice.

37:27.777 --> 37:28.945
No, no. Keep them on.

37:28.978 --> 37:30.980
That's it. Oh, even prettier.

37:31.014 --> 37:33.884
Thanks. Anyway...

37:33.916 --> 37:36.987
Long Tractor really is one of
the very few thriving bits.

37:37.019 --> 37:38.655
Yeah! Oh...

37:43.025 --> 37:44.461
Sorry about my...

37:47.731 --> 37:49.633
- Jeez, Glenn! Gosh!
- Sheila, come on.

37:49.666 --> 37:52.068
- No, Glenn.
- It's game 7.

37:52.101 --> 37:54.504
It's... Sheila!

37:58.809 --> 38:00.377
Hey, how's it going?

38:00.409 --> 38:02.045
Fuck off.

38:07.951 --> 38:09.420
Tim Long!

38:09.452 --> 38:10.521
Tim!

38:10.554 --> 38:11.655
Tim Long.

38:11.688 --> 38:14.959
Tim. Tim. Tim.

38:21.097 --> 38:23.300
Your friend
seems to be catching on.

38:24.034 --> 38:25.536
He's not my friend.

38:25.568 --> 38:27.737
He's more of a cruel joke
I played on myself.

38:27.771 --> 38:29.707
Well, he's no Dale Hawerchuk.

38:29.739 --> 38:30.640
Sure.

38:30.675 --> 38:31.942
That's my brother's
favorite hockey player.

38:31.974 --> 38:33.743
Not mine, though.

38:33.777 --> 38:35.378
Okay. You got it.

38:35.411 --> 38:37.080
If you asked me
my favorite hockey player,

38:37.114 --> 38:39.583
I definitely wouldn't say
Dale Hawerchuk.

38:43.119 --> 38:45.655
So, who's your favorite
hockey player, Brenda?

38:45.688 --> 38:47.690
Oh...

38:47.724 --> 38:49.593
I guess
I don't really have one.

38:54.764 --> 38:56.500
This rink is cold.

38:59.168 --> 39:02.538
- I'm sorry I make you fall.
- I'm so sorry.

39:02.572 --> 39:05.075
<i>It felt like I was
the only person in Hobart</i>

39:05.108 --> 39:07.644
<i>who hadn't fallen in love
with Stephane.</i>

39:07.677 --> 39:08.711
It's <i>pamplemousse.</i>

39:09.846 --> 39:11.414
It's
a fun word to say.

39:11.447 --> 39:12.750
<i>Made every female swoon.</i>

39:14.184 --> 39:16.086
<i>He inspired a freaking parade.</i>

39:16.552 --> 39:18.422
Aw...

39:18.454 --> 39:20.590
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

39:20.623 --> 39:23.626
I'm not wearing this. Uh-uh.

39:23.659 --> 39:26.763
<i>And he was the star of the
best team Hobart had seen in years.</i>

39:26.797 --> 39:29.967
<i>With a real shot at beating
our arch rival, Wingham.</i>

39:30.000 --> 39:31.501
No showboating.

39:35.172 --> 39:38.942
Ooh la la,
Stephane! Ooh la la, Stephane!

39:38.974 --> 39:41.045
Hobart Squirrels
are number one!

39:44.079 --> 39:46.683
Get him the
ball and watch him go!

39:48.117 --> 39:49.920
Seven, huh? I love Hobart.

39:49.952 --> 39:53.456
<i>But one thing Stephane couldn't
do was save my dad's failing business.</i>

39:53.489 --> 39:56.159
Sales are down this month.
We got to work on our technique.

39:56.193 --> 39:58.996
All right, Todd, let's try one out.
You be the customer.

40:00.463 --> 40:05.001
Hello, sir,
I'm interested in the 1160...

40:05.034 --> 40:09.038
Combine, but I'm not yet ready
to pull the trigger.

40:09.072 --> 40:13.076
Mmm-hmm. Okay, Geoff, you see how
he uses his hands when he's talking?

40:13.108 --> 40:15.011
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No. No.

40:15.045 --> 40:15.980
It's not wrong or right.

40:16.012 --> 40:19.182
It is just, uh,
a trait for me to mirror,

40:19.215 --> 40:21.818
when we're talking.
That way you'll trust me.

40:21.851 --> 40:23.987
And we'll establish rapport.

40:24.019 --> 40:26.623
Oh, here comes Ivan.

40:26.655 --> 40:29.625
Good news is he bringing today?
Jesus, fuck.

40:29.659 --> 40:31.762
Watch and learn, boys.
Watch and learn.

40:32.929 --> 40:33.963
Ivan.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.565
What can I do you for?

40:35.599 --> 40:38.535
Need to bring it back, Glenn.
Things are really bad.

40:38.568 --> 40:39.937
Uh-huh.

40:39.969 --> 40:43.673
Okay. I hear you.
I hear you, buddy.

40:43.706 --> 40:46.076
I think if you take a look at
our re-financing plans,

40:46.108 --> 40:50.713
you really don't want to make the
decision until such time as, uh...

41:00.123 --> 41:01.559
I'll start the paperwork.

41:02.791 --> 41:04.760
How's the wife?

41:04.793 --> 41:07.730
Not good, Glenn.
Not good.

41:07.764 --> 41:10.534
Excellent. <i>Excellente.</i>

41:10.567 --> 41:12.068
That was amazing,
Tim Long.

41:12.101 --> 41:17.974
You took that acetic acid. You sized it
up and then titrated the shit out of it.

41:18.007 --> 41:19.576
Uh, Tim. Tim, Tim.

41:21.878 --> 41:24.715
Drive us to Mary's house, huh?
She wants to make out.

41:25.949 --> 41:27.851
Uh, no can do. Sorry.

41:29.753 --> 41:32.523
Uh, because I promised
I'd give Brenda a ride home.

41:33.822 --> 41:35.025
I live right next to Brenda.

41:35.057 --> 41:37.827
Amazing.
We all go together.

41:37.860 --> 41:40.663
- <i>Formidable.</i> Let's go.
- <i>Formidable.</i>

41:42.898 --> 41:44.134
Come on.

41:47.304 --> 41:48.838
It's getting pretty snowy.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.842
It's just flurries.

41:52.876 --> 41:54.912
<i>♪ Flurries...</i>

41:54.945 --> 41:56.881
<i>♪ You got me in a hurry</i>

41:57.847 --> 42:01.218
<i>♪ Just to shovel my driveway</i>

42:02.184 --> 42:05.556
<i>♪ Squalls, I like you
best of all ♪</i>

42:05.588 --> 42:07.190
Hey, do you mind
if we're quiet?

42:07.222 --> 42:08.625
I'm an anxious driver.

42:08.657 --> 42:10.594
You got it.

42:12.896 --> 42:15.699
Tim, pull over, eh?

42:15.731 --> 42:18.201
Uh, no. No, it's fine.
We keep going.

42:20.804 --> 42:21.805
Jesus Christ!

42:26.775 --> 42:30.079
Tim, she likes you, huh.
Make with her.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.213
Uh...

42:31.246 --> 42:33.616
Did you learn to whisper
in a helicopter?

42:38.355 --> 42:40.324
Uh...

42:40.356 --> 42:42.625
- Do you want to...
- Yes.

42:43.193 --> 42:45.229
...uh, play a word game?

42:46.929 --> 42:48.331
Um...

42:48.364 --> 42:53.736
I'll say the name of a place and then
you can say another name of a place

42:53.769 --> 42:56.672
that begins with the last
letter of the place I said.

42:57.706 --> 43:00.710
- I'll start with Canada.
- Okay.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.347
Arkansas. Guys, do you
want to play? We're on "S."

43:04.380 --> 43:06.248
Sault Ste. Marie.

43:06.282 --> 43:08.085
That's a great one.

43:08.117 --> 43:10.152
My cousin plays junior
hockey there.

43:10.186 --> 43:11.888
They must be good.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.289
They're amazing.

43:17.159 --> 43:21.797
- Tim, just do it. The time is now.
- No.

43:22.632 --> 43:25.302
- The time is now!
- Okay.

43:25.335 --> 43:26.936
I'll tell you what?
I'll just get out.

43:28.771 --> 43:30.007
No.

43:39.849 --> 43:44.355
Ah... Ah... Oh...

44:01.304 --> 44:03.307
Oh, it's snowing,
it seems, huh?

44:05.875 --> 44:07.344
That was crazy, Tim Long.

44:09.045 --> 44:10.648
What letter are we on?

44:12.782 --> 44:14.284
<i>After that,
it became clear</i>

44:14.317 --> 44:16.820
<i>the person I had hoped
would be my salvation,</i>

44:16.853 --> 44:23.025
<i>my brother-in-arms,</i> mon camarade,
<i>made me feel lonelier than ever.</i>

44:23.059 --> 44:27.364
<i>So, while Stephane cut a swath
through Hobart's female population,</i>

44:27.396 --> 44:29.865
<i>I had never felt
like more of an outsider.</i>

44:30.833 --> 44:33.069
<i>Hobart's very own</i>
l'etranger.

44:43.213 --> 44:45.282
Hey, Stephane.

44:47.884 --> 44:48.918
Glenn.

44:50.519 --> 44:52.822
You must tell Sheila
your troubles, huh?

44:54.190 --> 44:55.392
What troubles?

45:00.063 --> 45:01.699
Oh, God. You're right.

45:02.398 --> 45:04.101
I just don't want
to worry her.

45:04.134 --> 45:06.503
You worry her now.
Remember, Glenn,

45:06.536 --> 45:12.009
honest, lead to close.
And close, lead to sexy.

45:13.777 --> 45:15.846
You're a wise man, Stephane.

45:17.981 --> 45:19.116
Hash browns?

45:21.251 --> 45:23.987
Not so wise for Tim,
I think.

45:25.054 --> 45:27.324
- He hate me.
- No, no, no.

45:27.356 --> 45:29.992
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

45:31.561 --> 45:32.763
Maybe.

45:33.663 --> 45:35.065
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm pretty sure he does.

45:35.097 --> 45:40.436
The thing about Tim is, and I say
this both as a father and a salesman.

45:40.469 --> 45:44.040
You can't coax him to do things.
He's got to be forced.

45:45.108 --> 45:46.876
You got to drag him to yes.

45:47.510 --> 45:49.379
You'll thank me later.

45:52.181 --> 45:54.950
Tim. Tim.

45:54.983 --> 45:58.387
- Wake up. We must go. <i>Allez.</i>
- What? What?

45:58.420 --> 46:00.423
Where are the keys
to the car?

46:03.492 --> 46:05.795
Stephane, what's going on?

46:05.829 --> 46:07.131
Did you get in trouble?

46:07.164 --> 46:10.432
Did you get a girl pregnant?
Did you get a bunch of girls pregnant?

46:10.465 --> 46:11.835
Do you have AIDS?

46:11.867 --> 46:13.469
Oh, I saw... Are you driving
with your knees?

46:13.503 --> 46:15.205
Tim, chill out.

46:15.237 --> 46:17.940
- "Chill out."
- You have to trust me, Tim.

46:17.974 --> 46:20.143
What? How the hell
did you get your license?

46:20.175 --> 46:22.578
- I don't have license.
- You don't have a license?

46:22.612 --> 46:24.815
I'm not stupid.
That's why we take the back roads.

46:24.847 --> 46:26.315
Okay, stop the car right now.

46:26.349 --> 46:28.351
Pull over, and you have to tell
me where we are going.

46:28.384 --> 46:31.153
Okay, okay,
we are going to McDonalds.

46:31.186 --> 46:34.123
- To McDonalds?
- Why? I know you love McDonalds.

46:34.157 --> 46:36.159
And it's only three hours away.
I look at the map.

46:36.192 --> 46:38.161
- Stop the car.
- Burgers for breakfast, Tim.

46:38.193 --> 46:40.596
- It is like dream come true for you.
- I don't care, stop the car.

46:51.940 --> 46:54.176
Okay,
so that's not my fault.

46:54.210 --> 46:56.813
You said stop, so I
stopped, so we stop.

46:58.347 --> 46:59.449
Oh, my... Get out.

46:59.481 --> 47:00.983
- What?
- Get out. Get out of the car.

47:01.016 --> 47:02.985
- Why?
- Because I'm driving us home.

47:03.018 --> 47:03.886
Okay, fine.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.155
Don't yell at me, huh.

47:08.090 --> 47:09.259
Whoa, whoa.

47:13.295 --> 47:14.463
Shit.

47:14.496 --> 47:17.600
Tim, I feel like I have done
things to make you not like me.

47:17.634 --> 47:18.969
Oh, what do you think?

47:20.302 --> 47:23.172
If you tell me the things,
I will not do them again.

47:23.206 --> 47:26.142
Okay, you know, why don't we
start with the drinking,

47:26.175 --> 47:28.345
the smoking,
the sex in the backseat,

47:28.378 --> 47:31.114
the porn and all that constant...

47:36.385 --> 47:37.487
What was that?

47:37.519 --> 47:39.056
I think you hit something.

47:41.224 --> 47:44.961
- Shit, shit, shit.
- Oh...

47:44.994 --> 47:46.663
- Oh, my God.
- I think you kill him.

47:46.695 --> 47:48.264
- Her.
- It's a girl?

47:48.297 --> 47:49.465
Yeah, it's a cow.

47:49.498 --> 47:50.900
Of course it's a girl.

47:51.233 --> 47:51.902
Oh.

47:51.934 --> 47:54.503
You're angry,
aren't you, huh?

47:54.536 --> 47:56.372
- Did not like to kill the cow?
- No.

47:56.405 --> 47:58.440
I... I don't enjoy killing cows.

47:58.474 --> 48:00.410
But you, uh, eat McDonalds.

48:01.577 --> 48:03.313
That's not the same.

48:03.346 --> 48:04.681
And you wear the shoes of
leather sometimes.

48:04.713 --> 48:06.982
Okay, stop.
Stop. Please stop talking.

48:07.016 --> 48:09.286
We're in a world
of shit here.

48:09.318 --> 48:10.320
God.

48:11.387 --> 48:12.655
Oh, my God.

48:12.688 --> 48:14.523
Oh, my God. Fuck.

48:14.556 --> 48:16.359
Tim, you break your mom's car.

48:17.092 --> 48:18.494
You know what?

48:18.527 --> 48:21.697
Before you came here, my life was
already a steaming pile of shit.

48:21.731 --> 48:25.068
But since you've been here,
you've put so much shit

48:25.101 --> 48:26.536
on top of this shit
that was already there,

48:26.568 --> 48:28.672
I can't even see where
the original shit was.

48:28.704 --> 48:31.273
Hey, can you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

48:31.306 --> 48:32.942
It's my fault.

48:32.976 --> 48:35.144
I don't what
kind of fucking asshole

48:35.177 --> 48:37.012
writes to another country
to get a friend.

48:37.045 --> 48:39.315
- Tim, Tim.
- You've taken a dump on my soul.

48:39.349 --> 48:41.084
- Tim.
- What?

48:41.117 --> 48:42.419
I don't know what to say.

48:43.652 --> 48:45.321
So I will just say this.

48:46.389 --> 48:47.391
He is alive.

48:48.157 --> 48:49.159
What?

48:52.695 --> 48:54.698
The Jesus cow, huh?

48:54.731 --> 48:56.299
He rise from the dead.

48:56.331 --> 48:57.599
She.

48:57.632 --> 48:59.435

49:01.637 --> 49:02.838
Oh, my God.

49:02.871 --> 49:05.975

We must have just stunned her.

49:06.009 --> 49:09.211
Just <i>fantastique,</i> huh?
Look at her go.

49:10.579 --> 49:13.016
You know what, Tim?

49:13.782 --> 49:15.351
Things, they work out.

49:17.452 --> 49:18.721
I've got something here.

49:19.554 --> 49:21.490
- Oh...
- Here we go.

49:22.759 --> 49:24.327
Come on, come on.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.562
To the Jesus cow.

49:25.594 --> 49:27.129
To the Jesus cow.

49:29.297 --> 49:31.032
Go on.

49:41.110 --> 49:43.480
Yeah, I guess.

49:43.512 --> 49:44.681
Yeah.

49:44.713 --> 49:46.083

50:44.507 --> 50:49.445
So, we look out the window and we
see the thief getting in the car.

50:49.478 --> 50:54.349
So, Tim, you know, Tim,
he run out and he says, "Stop, <i>arret.</i>

50:54.382 --> 50:58.788
"This is the car of my mother that
she want to go get the groceries

50:58.820 --> 51:01.523
"and to visit
various locations."

51:01.556 --> 51:03.158
Mmm-hmm.

51:03.192 --> 51:04.427
That's a direct quote.

51:06.394 --> 51:07.396
Tim said that?

51:08.463 --> 51:10.132
He's a hero, Glenn.

51:12.501 --> 51:13.570
He did it.

51:14.903 --> 51:17.407
<i>♪ Now I know
that I'm too young ♪</i>

51:17.440 --> 51:19.275
<i>I didn't have any money
to pay for the repairs</i>

51:19.307 --> 51:21.177
<i>but Stephane helped me

51:29.784 --> 51:31.320
Oh, <i>tres bien.</i>

51:31.353 --> 51:33.455
One day you speak the French
as good as me.

51:33.489 --> 51:36.358
Well, you know, I could lend you
some French films if you'd like.

51:36.391 --> 51:39.728
<i>Bande a part.
A bout de souffle.</i>

51:39.762 --> 51:41.465
Unless you've
already seen them.

51:42.731 --> 51:44.733
The French new wave.

51:44.766 --> 51:46.502
Talk about pretentious.

51:46.835 --> 51:47.870
Who said that?

51:47.903 --> 51:49.905
Well, I think it was Brenda.

51:49.938 --> 51:52.375
- Oh, that Brenda.
- Okay, listen.

51:52.407 --> 51:54.877
<i>Le cercle rouge</i> is
so not pretentious.

51:54.911 --> 51:58.181
I'm gonna lend it you
and you're gonna watch it.

51:58.213 --> 52:00.215
Okay, sir Tim Long.

52:00.248 --> 52:02.584
<i>I was beginning to feel
something bizarre</i>

52:02.617 --> 52:04.320
<i>and completely alien to me.</i>

52:04.686 --> 52:05.721
<i>Happiness.</i>

52:05.755 --> 52:08.224
Tim, he is
so clever, huh.

52:08.257 --> 52:10.360
He knows everything
about the music.

52:10.393 --> 52:11.394
And books.

52:12.228 --> 52:12.896
Yeah?

52:12.929 --> 52:13.730
I do.

52:13.762 --> 52:15.797
Sometimes
I'll be reading a book,

52:15.831 --> 52:17.367
laying back, reading a book,

52:17.400 --> 52:19.501
and then
I'll just be rocking out.

52:19.534 --> 52:21.603
I would be reading, rocking,

52:21.637 --> 52:23.373
I'll be rocking and reading.

52:23.405 --> 52:26.842
Reading about rocking, back and forth.

52:26.876 --> 52:27.911
I dig it. Yeah, yeah.

52:27.943 --> 52:29.344
He kill me, Tim.

52:29.378 --> 52:31.614
Tim, he kill me,
he kill everyone here.

52:31.646 --> 52:32.815
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

52:32.847 --> 52:36.286
I'm like the Upper Canada
Rebellion of 1838.

52:38.753 --> 52:41.757
Oh, 'cause that killed
several people.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.361
Lots, yeah,
killed lots of people.

52:45.661 --> 52:47.264
Hanged. They were all hanged.

52:48.965 --> 52:50.233
That's funny.

52:50.266 --> 52:51.800
Very funny.

52:51.833 --> 52:52.868
Glenn!

52:52.902 --> 52:54.704
Glenn, she's back!

any of that.</i>

53:14.789 --> 53:16.226
I would not fuck a toaster.

53:16.259 --> 53:17.360
I think you would.

53:17.393 --> 53:19.429
Stop, stop. Get out of here.

53:19.461 --> 53:20.295
My turn.

<i>This is what Tim says.</i>

<i>Howdy, I'm Tim.</i>

53:26.635 --> 53:29.239
- I like to fuck the book...
- No, no, no...

53:29.271 --> 53:30.840
- No, no, no, no.
- Fuck the book...

53:30.873 --> 53:32.775
That's a library copy.

53:32.807 --> 53:34.677
And I don't
fuck Camus, so...

53:34.710 --> 53:36.311
But seriously, Tim.

53:36.344 --> 53:39.548
Why? Why?
Why, you not like the girl, huh?

53:40.548 --> 53:41.550
What?

53:41.884 --> 53:43.853
I love the girl.

53:43.885 --> 53:45.688
You know how much
I love the girl.

53:47.389 --> 53:50.626
No, I do like the girl, a lot.
I just don't...

53:50.659 --> 53:52.928
I... I think I just prefer
not to talk to them

53:52.961 --> 53:53.996
or... Or bother them

53:54.030 --> 53:55.765
or touch...
Or touch them.

53:58.067 --> 53:59.302
Are you gay, huh?

53:59.335 --> 54:00.603
- You like the boy?
- Mmm-mmm.

54:00.635 --> 54:02.538
- No, it's okay, you like the boys.
- No, no, no.

54:02.570 --> 54:05.507
No, I like girls a lot.
I just, um...

54:05.541 --> 54:07.876
I just don't see
why they would like me.

54:07.909 --> 54:08.911
What? Why?

54:08.943 --> 54:11.547
You've good face, very clean.

54:11.914 --> 54:13.016
You, uh,

54:13.048 --> 54:14.817
- have a nice penis, huh?
- Mmm.

54:14.849 --> 54:16.719
I see it in the bathroom, Tim.

54:16.985 --> 54:18.688
Huh? Wow.

54:18.954 --> 54:20.523
Thank you?

54:20.556 --> 54:22.458
This Brenda...

54:22.490 --> 54:25.894
- She like you, I think.
- Oh, you know, I think...

54:25.927 --> 54:29.398
I mean, I like her, too.
She's really pretty and...

54:30.032 --> 54:31.367
I... I... What do I do?

54:31.400 --> 54:33.503
- How do I...
- Huh? You tell her. Easy.

54:33.536 --> 54:35.438
What, do you want me
to go up and say,

54:35.471 --> 54:38.875
"Hey, Brenda, I'm super
into you and I like your...

54:38.907 --> 54:42.311
"Your stupid songs
and your weird hair.

"And if you ask me
to touch your boobs,

"I would probably say yes.

"And, hey, well, see you later.
See you in history.

54:48.751 --> 54:51.653
"I think we're learning
about Sir Wilfrid Laurier."

54:51.686 --> 54:52.688
It's perfect.

54:52.722 --> 54:54.090
You say just that.

54:54.123 --> 54:57.926
And I like that little crinkle
between your eyes when you smile.

54:57.960 --> 55:02.465
And I like that your skin smells
like a Crispy Crunch bar.

55:02.498 --> 55:04.668

I just wanna...

Oh, fuck.

55:23.918 --> 55:26.989
Uh, Tim, I hope you are okay.

55:27.021 --> 55:28.924
It's important
to drink the water.

55:30.525 --> 55:32.594
You drink the water,
you not get sick.

55:44.072 --> 55:45.107
- Okay.
- This way.

55:45.141 --> 55:46.576
- This way, this way.

Wow, okay.

56:29.452 --> 56:30.620
Fifty-four dollars.

store and buy 54 things.

57:30.612 --> 57:32.013
Let's go, White Squirrels.

57:32.047 --> 57:34.150
Come on, Stephane.

57:34.182 --> 57:35.751
What are
you doing there?

57:35.784 --> 57:36.818
Use the wing.

57:36.851 --> 57:38.187
Give it to the wing.

57:41.724 --> 57:43.492
Come on.

57:43.525 --> 57:44.960
Way to go, brown clown.

57:44.994 --> 57:46.663
Yeah, brown clown,
way to go.

57:47.096 --> 57:48.465
All right.

57:50.132 --> 57:51.200
Hey.

57:51.233 --> 57:52.468
Hey, that's a foul.

57:52.501 --> 57:55.605
- Move it, move it.
- Watch your feet, brown clown.

58:08.317 --> 58:10.719
Uh, I'm sorry,
I'm really nervous.

58:10.753 --> 58:11.821
It's okay, it's okay.

58:11.853 --> 58:13.989
You know what, you can do your
presentation in English.

58:14.023 --> 58:15.191
The film is in French.

58:15.224 --> 58:16.926
Okay. Thank you.

58:17.860 --> 58:18.795
Um...

58:20.195 --> 58:22.298
Now you'll immediately see
the director uses

58:22.331 --> 58:25.701
costuming and lighting
to convey mood.

58:25.733 --> 58:29.237
And, um, we open on a
protagonist, who's a thief.

58:29.271 --> 58:31.140
A con, a cheat.

58:31.172 --> 58:32.274
A cock smoker.

58:33.909 --> 58:34.911
And he's...

58:36.045 --> 58:37.280
<i>I love the girl.</i>

58:37.313 --> 58:39.115
<i>You know how much
I love the girl.</i>

58:40.849 --> 58:41.650
Oh, shit.

58:44.786 --> 58:46.822
Watch your feet,
brown fucking clown.

58:48.289 --> 58:50.058
Oh!

59:06.007 --> 59:08.109
<i>No, I like girls a lot.
I just don't...</i>

59:08.143 --> 59:09.778
"I like girls."
What a freak.

59:11.347 --> 59:13.583
Tim wants to get on
Brenda Crowfoot!

59:14.215 --> 59:15.284
Loser.

59:15.317 --> 59:17.052
<i>I think that I would
probably say yes.</i>

59:17.952 --> 59:18.954
Stop it.

59:26.094 --> 59:27.829
This is
the greatest thing ever.

59:31.367 --> 59:33.169
Come on. Come on.

59:36.170 --> 59:37.172
Damn it!

59:40.108 --> 59:43.011
Well, son, I'm not one

not my nature.

59:45.914 --> 59:49.586
But, uh, you just fucked
the entire town.

59:50.251 --> 59:51.152
It's not my fault.

59:51.186 --> 59:53.088
Not your fault?
Well, whose fault is it?

59:53.121 --> 59:55.724
Uh, Colonel Gadhafi, hmm?

59:56.358 --> 59:58.126
You're a disgrace, son.

59:58.159 --> 59:59.694
You're disgrace
to the White Squirrel.

59:59.728 --> 01:00:02.065
There, I said it!
Okay? I said it.

01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:04.099
Fuck you

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.035
and fuck
your White Squirrel.

01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:09.137
And fuck this
piece of shit town!

01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:15.810
- Shame on you!
- I'll be okay. Huh?

01:00:15.844 --> 01:00:16.846
Enough!

01:00:16.878 --> 01:00:18.246
Me? You saw what
he did. This...

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.182
It's not how we do things
in Hobart.

01:00:20.215 --> 01:00:22.318
Oh, yeah. No.
We just victimize teenage boys

01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:25.421
because we're scared and jealous
that they're not like us.

01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:26.822
Sure.

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:30.726
You know what? I don't think I can
be with a man that I don't respect.

01:00:30.759 --> 01:00:32.228
We need to take a break.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.297
I'll pick up my stuff
on the weekend.

01:00:42.871 --> 01:00:44.307
What? Hmm?

01:00:45.306 --> 01:00:46.308
Nothing.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:48.978
You wanna give me 20?

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.079
- No.
- Twenty laps?

01:00:50.112 --> 01:00:51.347
High stepping.
Let's go.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.349
- High stepping. Let's go!
- I'm sorry. Ow!

01:00:54.382 --> 01:00:56.018
Come on,
let's go.

01:00:59.054 --> 01:01:01.757
I guess you got to finally
see the real Hobart.

01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:02.958
I do not believe this.

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:05.760
They say Canada is just
the ugly friend of the USA.

01:01:05.793 --> 01:01:07.462
But I loved
this ugly friend.

01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:08.798
Yeah, I know.

01:01:09.797 --> 01:01:11.800
They can only fool you
for so long.

01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:12.868
Yeah, I don't understand.

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:15.438
Hey, Brenda, you're gonna go
make out with Tim Long?

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.304
What?

01:01:16.338 --> 01:01:19.775
No. I have Cape Breton
step dancing.

01:01:19.807 --> 01:01:21.177
I'm nice to them.
I say nice...

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.179
Hey, Brenda, Tim Long
is waiting for you.

01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:26.181
- He's just dying to see you.
- And your boobs.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.084
Like I said, I have
Cape Breton step dance

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.419
on a Wednesday, so...

01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:33.722
Why is everyone asking me
about Tim Long?

01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:36.024
You total dick!

01:01:36.057 --> 01:01:38.260
- Tim.
- Was that supposed to be funny?

01:01:38.293 --> 01:01:40.796
You swapped that stupid video
we made for <i>Le Cercle Rouge.</i>

01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:42.331
- That was my presentation!
- No.

01:01:42.364 --> 01:01:45.067
No, you told me that you wanted
to show the movie to Brenda.

01:01:45.099 --> 01:01:46.201
- What?
- Come on, Long.

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.303
She's right there,
hump it out.

01:01:47.335 --> 01:01:50.739
No, I sw... I switched
the movie to push you, huh,

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:53.409
because I want Brenda to see
how much you like her.

01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:54.976
Okay, what movie?

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:58.214
Stephane swapped <i>Le Cercle Rouge</i>
for this stupid video we took,

01:01:58.246 --> 01:02:00.482
and the whole class saw me say
how much I like your hair

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.985
and your stupid songs and
how much I want to kiss you.

01:02:03.018 --> 01:02:04.253
You did?

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:07.123
Tim, I was trying to be
a good friend.

01:02:07.155 --> 01:02:08.423
You humiliated me.

01:02:08.456 --> 01:02:11.259
You made me look like
an idiot. You ruined my life.

01:02:11.293 --> 01:02:12.294
You're no friend of mine.

01:02:12.327 --> 01:02:15.096
No, of course,
because you have no friends,

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.798
not me, not anyone.

01:02:16.831 --> 01:02:18.933
You know, what they're
saying about you is true.

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:20.336
You're a no-friend loser.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:23.972
You're a self-centered,
narcissistic, sex crazed,

01:02:24.005 --> 01:02:25.106
- thoroughly absurd...
- What?

01:02:25.139 --> 01:02:27.009
Okay, so you like
my hair?

01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:28.810
No, I don't like
your hair.

01:02:28.844 --> 01:02:30.246
I... I...
I was drunk.

01:02:30.278 --> 01:02:32.414
And he made me say things
I don't mean to say.

01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:35.416
I don't like your hair
or your stupid songs or you!

01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:36.752
I don't like you!

01:02:42.324 --> 01:02:43.326
Brenda.

01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:45.293
Shit.

01:02:45.327 --> 01:02:48.397
You know, I wish
I not choose you,

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.265
huh, or this bucket
of shit place.

01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:52.434
Yeah, well,
I wish that, too.

01:02:52.467 --> 01:02:55.872
<i>Va te faire foutre!</i>

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.920
Please, somebody!

01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:13.121
Mom! Mom!

01:03:15.389 --> 01:03:18.360
Where are the Doritos?
And where's Mom?

01:03:23.865 --> 01:03:27.036
"Dearest Tim, I've decided to
move out of the house for a..."

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:28.403
- What?
- It gets worse.

01:03:29.938 --> 01:03:33.142
Well, maybe not worse,
but it starts bad, stays bad.

01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:37.012
<i>Your dad
is a wonderful man,</i>

01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:39.347
<i>but it's been clear
for some time</i>

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.851
<i>that my life is missing
a certain</i> je ne sais quoi.

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.887
<i>"Je ne sais quoi"?</i>

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.021
Yeah, <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

01:03:46.054 --> 01:03:47.557
God, fucking Stephane.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.459
Language.

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:56.465
<i>I... I couldn't believe I'd
invited this chaos into my life.</i>

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.139
You can come stay with us
for as long as you need.

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:07.242
Thank you.

01:04:07.275 --> 01:04:09.210
<i>It wasn't just me
shunning Stephane.</i>

01:04:09.244 --> 01:04:12.213
<i>The school had turned
on him, too.</i>

01:04:12.246 --> 01:04:16.217
<i>He'd lost us a soccer match and
called our town a piece of shit.</i>

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:17.619
<i>Which it might have been,</i>

01:04:17.652 --> 01:04:19.387
<i>but they didn't like hearing
it from someone like him.</i>

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:23.625
<i>If they were looking for a reason
to turn on a stranger in their town,</i>

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.494
<i>they'd found one.</i>

01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:45.481
Looks good.

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.883
Ah...

01:04:48.416 --> 01:04:51.019
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:04:51.052 --> 01:04:52.387
Yeah, I'm good.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.422
Sit down,
let's chat.

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:57.325
Uh, how's Aunt Thelma?

01:04:57.358 --> 01:05:00.596
She snores. One night,
at 4:00 in the morning, she...

01:05:00.628 --> 01:05:02.964
I can't believe Stephane
made you leave.

01:05:02.998 --> 01:05:03.999
What?

01:05:04.032 --> 01:05:04.967
I mean,
you know I'm agnostic,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.168
but I think he might
literally be a demon.

01:05:07.202 --> 01:05:10.139
Tim! Things have not
been great

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:12.608
between your dad and I
for a very long time.

01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:16.144
Okay? Stephane is not to
blame and neither are you.

01:05:16.177 --> 01:05:17.612
Yeah.
Nobody's blaming me.

01:05:17.646 --> 01:05:19.448
I'm... I'm great.

01:05:20.248 --> 01:05:23.018
Yeah, you're great.
You're great.

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:24.319
- Come here.
- Who would blame me?

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:26.489
Come here.
Nobody is blaming you.

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:28.724
- Sheila?
- Mmm, just a sec.

01:05:28.757 --> 01:05:29.992
Sheila?

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:31.594
Love you so much.

01:05:32.693 --> 01:05:34.563
Oh. Hey.

01:05:34.596 --> 01:05:35.931
Is that Kevin?

01:05:35.963 --> 01:05:39.467
- Yeah, it's Kevin. Yeah, he looks pissed.
- Just 10 seconds. Please.

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:41.237
Sheila!

01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:44.572
This better not be about
the fucking acorn, okay?

01:05:44.606 --> 01:05:47.576
- It's not about the acorn.
- Okay.

01:05:47.608 --> 01:05:50.712
You're gonna be at the parade
tomorrow, right? Okay?

01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.583
Try to remember that most
people are not really bad

01:05:54.615 --> 01:05:58.152
and not really stupid,
okay?

01:05:58.186 --> 01:06:00.356
They're just doing the best
that they can.

01:06:04.092 --> 01:06:05.561
- Yes, Kevin.
- It's about the acorn.

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:07.628
I knew it was about
the fucking acorn.

01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:11.701
The town, the squirrel
and my life.

01:06:17.639 --> 01:06:18.740
What...

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.979
<i>Putain, merde,</i> shit!

01:06:24.512 --> 01:06:27.281
You know
why I come here?

01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:29.650
I thought it would
be different, huh.

01:06:29.684 --> 01:06:31.754
Where I'm from,
the kids who look like me,

01:06:31.786 --> 01:06:34.456
they only hang out with
people who look like me.

01:06:35.523 --> 01:06:36.525
In Hobart,

01:06:37.324 --> 01:06:39.093
it's the same,

01:06:39.126 --> 01:06:41.130
maybe because Hobart
is shit.

01:06:41.663 --> 01:06:43.632
Huh. Canada is shit!

01:06:43.664 --> 01:06:46.101
They'll always find a way
to screw you.

01:06:46.134 --> 01:06:49.637
- I... I need to go clear my head.
- Here, take the truck.

01:06:52.673 --> 01:06:53.775
Thank you, Crowfeet.

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:04.420
<i>The next morning, as everyone
was getting ready for the parade,</i>

01:07:04.452 --> 01:07:06.655
<i>all I could think about
was where Stephane was,</i>

01:07:06.688 --> 01:07:08.791
<i>and who else's life
he might be ruining.</i>

01:07:15.262 --> 01:07:16.531
Whoa.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.472
Okay, we, uh...
We gotta...

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:28.177
- We gotta stay calm.
- Why?

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.811
It's not fair!

01:07:29.844 --> 01:07:33.648
Kev, it's gonna be okay.
Maybe we can fix it.

01:07:33.681 --> 01:07:37.185
It won't be the same!
They ruined her!

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:39.153
"Her"?

01:07:39.186 --> 01:07:41.322
Who could do
such a thing?

01:07:42.456 --> 01:07:44.092
I'll give you
three guesses.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.160
Stephane?

01:07:45.193 --> 01:07:47.196
He's not that kind of kid.

01:07:47.728 --> 01:07:48.596
Mmm.

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.333
- Is he?
- Well, you tell me.

01:07:51.365 --> 01:07:53.367
There's the head butt,
huh?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.536
There's the, uh...

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:58.106
"Fuck
the White Squirrel," right?

01:07:58.139 --> 01:08:02.310
Plus, I saw him hanging
around the town hall at 3:00 this morning.

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.512
So you think Stephane
did this?

01:08:03.545 --> 01:08:06.181
What I think is
we don't know shit, son.

01:08:06.213 --> 01:08:07.548
Of course
we won't know anything

01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:09.550
until we get
the autopsy results back.

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:11.452
Appears to be
a single assailant.

01:08:11.485 --> 01:08:13.788
Subcutaneous abrasions
along the right femur there.

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:16.323
It looks like there's some
flesh underneath the claws,

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:17.626
which means the victim
did fight back.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:18.960
Tell me
she didn't suffer.

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:22.430
Oh, Kevin,
I would love to be able to tell you that,

01:08:22.462 --> 01:08:24.564
but I'm not a liar.

01:08:24.599 --> 01:08:26.502
We don't know anything
about this guy.

01:08:26.533 --> 01:08:28.604
I heard his old man
did some jail time.

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.505
Well, that's true.
It's in his file.

01:08:30.537 --> 01:08:32.740
I read
the file too, Gary.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.577
His dad was arrested
during labor protest.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.112
- He was the head of the union.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:40.381
Take this down to the lab. Have the
boys check it for blood, urine, semen.

01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:42.484
- Yes, sir.
- My point exactly.

01:08:42.515 --> 01:08:44.484
Troublemaker,
born and bred.

01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:46.755
The apple never falls
far from the tree.

01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:49.823
Okay.
Maybe he came here for a fresh start.

01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:52.528
Fresh start? The only thing he
got fresh with is Herb's daughter.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.194
Yeah... What?

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:55.564
Fresh with
your daughter.

01:08:57.497 --> 01:08:59.367
Did you have
a hand in this?

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.836
What? No, no, no, no,
I haven't...

01:09:00.868 --> 01:09:03.537
He's not staying...
He's staying with the Crowfoots.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.573
Right.
Shooting off guns.

01:09:05.606 --> 01:09:07.242
He hit my car
last night.

01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:09.243
Maybe he was aiming
at my gas tank.

01:09:09.277 --> 01:09:10.645
Ka-boom!

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.680
Make my wife
a widow.

01:09:12.712 --> 01:09:14.515
All right, why don't you quit
crying into your Dinky Donuts

01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:16.819
and bring him in, hmm?

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.487
Sure thing, Gary.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.457
Yeah, there is no way.
There's no freaking way.

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.527
<i>I know he hated
the White Squirrel, but...</i>

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.895
Yeah, I know, but he was
with you last night, right?

01:09:27.929 --> 01:09:30.599
Sure, until he took
my brother's truck

01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:33.367
and drove off into
the direction of the town.

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.569
Super furious. And then,

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:36.604
he came back
this morning looking...

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.173
Mega-guilty.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.743
But still,
there's no freaking way.

01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:43.810
Okay, look, I need you
to do something for me.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.649
No, I am not doing
anything for you.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:48.850
That tractor has sailed.

01:09:48.881 --> 01:09:51.487
Okay. Would you do it
for Stephane?

01:09:56.858 --> 01:09:58.560
<i>Stephane
was many things...</i>

01:09:58.592 --> 01:10:01.262
<i>Oversexed,
intellectually bereft,</i>

01:10:01.296 --> 01:10:02.530
<i>permanently erect.</i>

01:10:03.698 --> 01:10:06.602
<i>But I knew he wasn't a liar
or a criminal.</i>

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:08.904
<i>And I had to make the town
see that, too.</i>

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.606
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:19.314 --> 01:10:20.816
Brenda.

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:23.351
That is crazy.
That is so weird.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.587
Tim Long? What are
the chances of that?

01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:27.322
One in a million, maybe.

01:10:27.354 --> 01:10:30.558
I don't know how he got here.
That's too weird.

01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:32.161
I just can't believe it.

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:35.697
I... I never knew
this could never happen.

01:10:35.729 --> 01:10:37.465
It's the weirdest thing.

01:10:37.498 --> 01:10:38.934
What do you want, Tim?

01:10:38.966 --> 01:10:41.703
Listen, you're in big trouble. Okay?
Because they think you did that.

01:10:42.369 --> 01:10:43.604
Just like Paris.

01:10:43.637 --> 01:10:46.007
Something go wrong,
blame Stephane.

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.710
The squirrel get broken,
you blame Stephane.

01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:50.612
Money go missing,
you blame Stephane.

01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:53.015
Substitute teacher
gets pregnant,

01:10:53.047 --> 01:10:54.250
blame Stephane.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.252
What?

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:59.320
Fuck. Shit.

01:10:59.354 --> 01:11:00.689
- Okay, come on.
- Why?

01:11:00.721 --> 01:11:02.557
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

01:11:03.457 --> 01:11:05.326
Okay. Put these on.

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:09.798
Please, it's your turn
to trust me.

01:11:23.043 --> 01:11:25.514
I can't see shit.
Which way are we going?

01:11:25.546 --> 01:11:27.648
If you're gonna let
your kids come to the parade,

01:11:27.681 --> 01:11:29.984
you can't let 'em play
with the beaver tails, okay?

01:11:30.018 --> 01:11:31.653
They play
with their bottoms all day,

01:11:31.685 --> 01:11:33.521
next thing you know,
there's baby shit in the beaver.

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:35.291
That's why
you don't adopt.

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:41.730
I went to the Crowfoots',
and he was already gone.

01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:45.800
Damn it, Herb.
You had one job to do.

01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.868
- I'm sorry, Gary.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:11:47.902 --> 01:11:49.805
I saw their truck
on the edge of town.

01:11:49.837 --> 01:11:51.005
He might be here somewhere.

01:11:51.038 --> 01:11:53.774
No shit. He's probably trying
to finish what he started.

01:11:53.807 --> 01:11:55.609
He only wants to ruin
our whole damn parade.

01:11:55.643 --> 01:11:56.810
- He wouldn't.
- He wouldn't?

01:11:56.844 --> 01:12:00.114
Oh, he hates this town,
and everything we stand for, Herb.

01:12:00.148 --> 01:12:03.685
Peace, freedom,
more traditional way of life.

01:12:03.717 --> 01:12:05.320
- Hi, Gary.
- Kev.

01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:08.824
Now, listen,
I want you to do

01:12:08.856 --> 01:12:11.859
a thorough sweep of the
entire parade route, okay?

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:15.130
And you let me know when you
have eyes on that son of a bitch.

01:12:15.162 --> 01:12:16.263
Yes, sir.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.849
Tim! Tim! Tim!
Where are we going?

01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:34.817
What's the plan, Tim?

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.885
People will hear the accent!

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.586
I don't have accent,
you have accent!

01:12:38.619 --> 01:12:41.556
Hey, guys, I actually
can't see anything, so...

01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:43.824
SOS!

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:45.594
Tim,
Brenda is falling.

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:46.662
Oh, fuck!

01:12:46.694 --> 01:12:47.695
Let me help you up.
Give me your hand.

01:12:47.729 --> 01:12:50.065
Hey, that Mexican fuck
is actually that Arab fuck!

01:12:50.097 --> 01:12:52.466
No, no, no.
I am a Mexican.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.702
Uh, <i>por favor!</i>

01:12:53.734 --> 01:12:54.769
Hey, it's him!

01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:55.970
That's him!

01:12:56.003 --> 01:12:57.838
That's the perp!

01:12:57.872 --> 01:12:59.474
Fuck.

01:12:59.506 --> 01:13:01.475
Fuck! Fuck!

01:13:01.509 --> 01:13:03.412
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way.

01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:05.880
<i>Right then, I knew I had
to stand up for Stephane,</i>

01:13:05.913 --> 01:13:08.182
<i>and make the town see
what I saw in him,</i>

01:13:08.216 --> 01:13:10.085
<i>because that's what friends do
for each other.</i>

01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:11.720
Stop the parade!
Stop.

01:13:11.752 --> 01:13:13.354
Stop the parade.

01:13:13.387 --> 01:13:15.756
What are we dancing for?
I didn't know there was gonna be a dance.

01:13:15.789 --> 01:13:16.824
Stop.

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:18.760
This is fun,
but who is that?

01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:20.027
What do you think
I'm doing? Stop.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.163
I'm not dancing.
Stop the parade.

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.698
Stop the...

01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:25.099
Stop the friggin'
parade.

01:13:25.132 --> 01:13:27.435
What are you doing,
Long?

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.537
Hey, Gary.

01:13:29.203 --> 01:13:30.838
Look what the cat
dragged in.

01:13:30.872 --> 01:13:32.908
No, no, no.
Let him go, please.

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:33.908
Let him go.
Please, let him go.

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:37.179
- You're ruining my parade.
- Just hold on.

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:39.148
<i>Uh...</i>

01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:41.784
<i>Okay.</i>

01:13:47.488 --> 01:13:48.656
<i>Okay.</i>

01:13:48.689 --> 01:13:52.760
<i>Now I know I've never been the
most popular kid in school...</i>

01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:53.996
No shit!

01:13:54.662 --> 01:13:55.730
<i>Okay.</i>

01:13:55.762 --> 01:13:58.600
<i>Uh, and I know a lot of you
probably think I'm some...</i>

01:13:58.632 --> 01:13:59.434
You're a creep!

01:13:59.466 --> 01:14:00.835
- Nerd.
- That's right.

01:14:00.868 --> 01:14:02.804
Go make another tape,
you pervert.

01:14:02.837 --> 01:14:04.106
Go bang Brenda.

01:14:04.838 --> 01:14:06.073
Everyone hates you.

01:14:07.574 --> 01:14:09.109
<i>Okay.</i>

01:14:09.143 --> 01:14:11.813
<i>Well, uh, I just want
to say that Stephane...</i>

01:14:13.014 --> 01:14:16.551
<i>Stephane Belmade is my friend,
and he's a really great guy.</i>

01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:18.052
<i>Okay, come on.</i>

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.756
<i>And I know he would never
do that to the squirrel.</i>

01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:23.557
But how do you know,
Tim?

01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:24.660
Yeah!

01:14:27.228 --> 01:14:29.631
<i>Because...
Because I just know.</i>

01:14:30.664 --> 01:14:31.733
<i>I just know.</i>

01:14:37.872 --> 01:14:40.842
<i>And if you're not willing
to give a visitor to our town</i>

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:41.909
<i>the benefit of the doubt,</i>

01:14:41.943 --> 01:14:44.880
<i>then I'm not sure I have
anything left to say to you.</i>

01:14:44.912 --> 01:14:45.980
Okey-doke.

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.548
<i>Wait, no, wait.
Can you stop, please?</i>

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:50.818
<i>It's a figure of speech.
I have a little bit more to say.</i>

01:14:52.753 --> 01:14:56.190
<i>Stephane Belmade has done
so much for so many of us.</i>

01:14:56.858 --> 01:14:58.592
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:02.230
<i>You know, he came here and he was
ready to see the best in all of us,</i>

01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:04.131
<i>but we chose to see
the worst in him</i>

01:15:04.164 --> 01:15:06.935
<i>because of what,
because of the way he looks.</i>

01:15:06.967 --> 01:15:08.269
<i>But, look,
it's not too late.</i>

01:15:08.302 --> 01:15:11.006
<i>We can launch a full-scale
investigation, we could...</i>

01:15:11.038 --> 01:15:13.073
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
we know what he did.

01:15:13.106 --> 01:15:14.509
- Yeah.
- Okay?

01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:17.279
I saw him break into town hall
yelling, "Fuck ze White Squirrel!"

01:15:17.311 --> 01:15:18.546
- <i>Okay.</i>
- "Fuck it. Fuck it hard!"

01:15:18.579 --> 01:15:21.815
<i>Okay, that can't be true.
Stephane, where were you last night?</i>

01:15:21.849 --> 01:15:22.984
Yeah.

01:15:23.016 --> 01:15:24.552
Tell us.

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:28.088
I cannot say
where I was. <i>Desole.</i>

01:15:28.122 --> 01:15:29.925
Herb,
take him away.

01:15:29.957 --> 01:15:30.991
- <i>Wait.</i>
- Yes, sir.

01:15:31.024 --> 01:15:32.693
- <i>No, no, no.</i>
- Wait!

01:15:33.694 --> 01:15:34.695
Glenn?

01:15:35.162 --> 01:15:36.797
Stephane was
with me.

01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:37.899
- Come on.
- What?

01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:39.733
And thank
friggin' Christ he was.

01:15:39.766 --> 01:15:42.002
Where to begin? Uh...

01:15:42.036 --> 01:15:43.570
Seven years ago,

01:15:43.604 --> 01:15:47.775
the Canadian government made a series
of disastrous economic decisions...

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:48.844
<i>Dad!</i>

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:51.613
<i>Maybe... Maybe start
nearer the end.</i>

01:15:51.645 --> 01:15:54.748
Smart boy. I just wanted
to give them a bit of context,

01:15:54.782 --> 01:15:57.185
put a backstory there, but,
uh...

01:15:57.217 --> 01:15:59.787
<i>Hello? Um...</i>

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.288
<i>Like a lot of youse,</i>

01:16:01.322 --> 01:16:04.059
<i>I've got a business
that's going under.</i>

01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:07.628
<i>Last night, I was desperate,
on the verge of losing everything.</i>

01:16:10.097 --> 01:16:11.233
Hey!

01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:15.136
Glenn, what are
you doing, huh?

01:16:15.168 --> 01:16:17.204
<i>Stephane threw me
in a chair,</i>

01:16:17.238 --> 01:16:20.876
<i>made me some coffee and
talked some sense into me.</i>

01:16:24.444 --> 01:16:28.782
<i>"Glenn,
you get caught, you go to jail!</i>

01:16:28.815 --> 01:16:33.253
<i>"You cannot do that to Tim and to Sheila.
They love you so much."</i>

01:16:33.287 --> 01:16:36.157
<i>Uh, I can't really
do the accent that good.</i>

01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:39.094
<i>Anyways, he sat with me
all night.</i>

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:43.164
<i>He didn't leave my side, did you,
my little French buddy?</i>

01:16:43.197 --> 01:16:45.233
Mr. Long's
telling the truth!

01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:47.134
There's a bonfire
in there!

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:48.402
Hold on a moment.

01:16:48.435 --> 01:16:50.371
You couldn't have seen
Stephane.

01:16:50.404 --> 01:16:54.141
So, where did you spend
last night, Gary?

01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:55.243
Me?

01:16:55.275 --> 01:16:56.612
Fuck.

01:16:57.712 --> 01:16:58.880
Uh...

01:16:58.912 --> 01:16:59.980
I was with Diane.

01:17:00.014 --> 01:17:01.682
Of course, we were, uh...

01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:03.752
Engaging in...

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.287
Rather heavy petting,

01:17:06.319 --> 01:17:11.893
that led to full-blown,
penetrative intercourse.

01:17:11.926 --> 01:17:13.094
Are you insane?

01:17:13.127 --> 01:17:15.730
I am right here,
and that didn't happen.

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:21.936
Could have happened.

01:17:25.038 --> 01:17:26.440
Hey!

01:17:26.474 --> 01:17:28.143
Don't let him get away!

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:30.412
Oh!

01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:37.652
<i>I'm sure you can guess who
actually did destroy the squirrel.</i>

01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:54.769
<i>By dinner time, everyone just
forgot their race-based witch-hunt,</i>

01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:57.204
<i>their xenophobic rush
to judgment,</i>

01:17:57.238 --> 01:18:00.175
<i>their ethnically-motivated
vigilantism...</i>

01:18:00.207 --> 01:18:01.710
<i>You get the point.</i>

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:04.179
Tim Long,
you stand up for me.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.814
In front
of the whole town.

01:18:07.515 --> 01:18:09.951
These people,
they hate you.

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:11.186
No, I...

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.319
I wouldn't say "Hate."

01:18:12.353 --> 01:18:13.186
<i>Oui. Oui, oui.</i>

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.255
They said terrible things
about you.

01:18:15.288 --> 01:18:18.358
"Tim Long is a bookworm."
"Tim Long is a loser."

01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:22.362
"Tim Long is needle-dicked,
four-eyes shit boy."

01:18:22.395 --> 01:18:24.198
I actually haven't heard
that one.

01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:26.467
Terrible things.
Me, I don't say these things

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.569
- because...
- Who said "Shit boy?"

01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:31.072
Well, once, because we are
<i>meilleurs copains.</i>

01:18:31.104 --> 01:18:32.440
<i>Meilleurs copains.</i>

01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:35.811
I guess we are.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.985
Oh, God. Okay.
I've gotta...

01:18:46.253 --> 01:18:48.922
I gotta do something.

01:18:48.956 --> 01:18:51.259
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.994
Go get her, Tim Long.

01:18:58.966 --> 01:19:02.270
Why didn't you tell me about the
business going in the crapper?

01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:04.739
'Cause I'm an idiot.

01:19:06.039 --> 01:19:07.876
We might have
to sell the house.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:09.844
Mmm.

01:19:09.877 --> 01:19:11.980
We've rented
before.

01:19:12.012 --> 01:19:15.015
Maybe your mom will die soon too.
She's got cash, right?

01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:21.021
We'll figure it out.

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:22.757
We always do.

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:26.994
We still got
what's most important.

01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:36.003
You're... You're talking about
us being together, right?

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.472
- Yes, Glenn.
- Yeah.

01:19:38.506 --> 01:19:41.777
Well, maybe we should tell Tim
that we've patched things up.

01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:45.445
Oh, I mean...

01:19:45.479 --> 01:19:48.149
We've started the difficult
and painful journey

01:19:48.181 --> 01:19:50.018
towards patching
things up.

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:51.052
Yeah.

01:19:53.988 --> 01:19:55.390
Yeah, yeah. Good.

01:19:57.925 --> 01:19:58.927
Hello, Tim Long.

01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:05.332
I thought what you did
today was not un-heroic,

01:20:05.365 --> 01:20:07.002
and maybe...

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.873
I... I... I'm really
sorry, Brenda.

01:20:12.907 --> 01:20:17.412
I... I do like your hair,
and your crazy songs, and I...

01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:31.425
Hi.

01:20:31.458 --> 01:20:33.595
Don't let us
stop you.

01:20:33.627 --> 01:20:36.197
They were watching
the whole time?

01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:37.297
It's a good
technique, huh?

01:20:37.331 --> 01:20:38.867
Not bad.

01:20:38.899 --> 01:20:41.201
I can... I can feel
you looking. Please stop.

01:20:41.234 --> 01:20:43.604
I don't know...
I don't know why you're staring.

01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:45.207
We're very proud
of you.

01:20:56.984 --> 01:20:58.019
All right.

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.289
All right.

01:21:01.322 --> 01:21:03.324
- "All right" what?
- Just hold still.

01:21:03.356 --> 01:21:04.559
Okay.

01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:21.442
<i>The rest of Stephane's stay
with us was, well, kind of terrific.</i>

01:21:21.475 --> 01:21:24.045
<i>Some of the best times
I've ever had.</i>

01:21:29.582 --> 01:21:31.117
You know,
if you look closely,

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:36.557
you can see the framing's really been
influenced by Godard and Truffaut...

01:21:38.492 --> 01:21:40.528
I made
a mistake. Okay?

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.230
So, you haul me in.

01:21:43.264 --> 01:21:45.667
If the coach hadn't dropped
me for the play-offs,

01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:47.668
you wouldn't be staring
at me right here,

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.971
broken, humiliated,
soiled.

01:21:51.137 --> 01:21:54.341
<i>But like all of life's
loveliest things,</i>

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:56.310
<i>it was over way too soon.</i>

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:57.979
Oh, I'm so sorry
we weren't up

01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:59.579
to your high standards,
Jean-Claude...

01:21:59.613 --> 01:22:03.451
Terrible cuisine, terrible
town, terrible country.

01:22:04.051 --> 01:22:05.553
Screw you!

01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:07.055
Let's go.

01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:10.590
Hey, look.

01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:12.492
It's the Hobart
posse, huh?

01:22:12.525 --> 01:22:14.194
Hey!

01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:16.530
There you are.

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:18.199
We came to say
goodbye.

01:22:19.332 --> 01:22:20.501
And we're sorry.

01:22:21.368 --> 01:22:24.304
We drew certain
conclusions

01:22:24.337 --> 01:22:26.106
based on you being
different.

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.208
And that's wrong.

01:22:28.274 --> 01:22:30.577
In Hobart,
we pride ourselves

01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:32.279
in treating everyone
equally,

01:22:32.313 --> 01:22:34.382
regardless of race.

01:22:40.387 --> 01:22:41.689
Oh, you're being serious.

01:22:42.489 --> 01:22:44.324
What we mean is, uh,

01:22:44.358 --> 01:22:46.226
we were wrong.

01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.329
I will miss
this Hobart.

01:22:48.362 --> 01:22:50.530
I want to make love
on all of you.

01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:51.999
Thank you.

01:22:52.032 --> 01:22:53.768
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, this is the last call</i>

01:22:53.801 --> 01:22:56.338
<i>for flight number 827
to Paris.</i>

01:22:59.073 --> 01:23:00.074
We're gonna
miss you, buddy.

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.644
<i>Bonne chance,</i>
my brown-skinned friend.

01:23:07.814 --> 01:23:09.550
We are
<i>meilleurs copains.</i>

01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:11.251
Best friends.

01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:16.191
I'll go now.

01:23:17.123 --> 01:23:18.126
Yeah.

01:23:23.663 --> 01:23:24.765
I'll write to you.

01:23:24.798 --> 01:23:26.466
I'll write to you,
Tim Long.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.469
And I'll use the big words
you teach me.

01:23:28.502 --> 01:23:29.671
Diaphanous.

01:23:30.837 --> 01:23:32.773
<i>Stephane might not
have been what I wanted,</i>

01:23:32.806 --> 01:23:34.775
<i>but it turned out
he was what I needed.</i>

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:37.244
<i>And I think
he needed me too.</i>

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.646
<i>He might not have
enlightened me on Truffaut</i>

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.516
- <i>or how to conjugate a verb...</i>
- Hey.

01:23:41.548 --> 01:23:44.217
<i>...but he taught me things
I'll never forget.</i>

01:23:44.251 --> 01:23:45.353
<i>About love,</i>

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.622
<i>life,</i>

01:23:47.654 --> 01:23:49.090
<i>second chances...</i>

01:23:49.122 --> 01:23:51.025
- Bye, Stephane.
- Bye, Tim Long.

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.494
<i>...and how to undo
a bra with one hand.</i>

01:23:54.528 --> 01:23:55.596
Sexy nerd couple.

01:24:12.412 --> 01:24:14.648
Tim Long,
are you wearing cologne?

01:24:15.716 --> 01:24:18.453
Yeah. Yeah, well,
you know what they say.

01:24:18.485 --> 01:24:22.356
"Before sex happens in the
pants, it happens in the nose."

01:24:23.123 --> 01:24:25.393
Oh.

01:24:26.359 --> 01:24:27.862
<i>As I waved goodbye,</i>

01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:31.732
<i>I didn't know whether
it was</i> au revoir <i>or</i> adieu.

01:24:31.765 --> 01:24:34.602
<i>But I did know that
Stephane had changed my life...</i>

01:24:35.235 --> 01:24:36.237
<i>Forever.</i>

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.818
Bonjour!
<i>We made it to Paris,</i>

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:54.721
<i>my dream city, the heart of all
culture and all that is good.</i>

01:24:54.755 --> 01:24:56.623
<i>We made it. We made it.</i>

01:24:57.490 --> 01:24:59.226
<i>Tim, look.</i>

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.262
<i>I made the Eiffel Tower
my cock.</i>

01:25:01.295 --> 01:25:02.262
<i>I know.</i>

01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:04.731
<i>Hey, Tim, you come
jerk me off, huh?</i>

01:25:04.765 --> 01:25:06.501
<i>It'd be funny.
You jerk me off.</i>

01:25:06.533 --> 01:25:08.769
<i>Okay.
When in Paris.</i>

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.971
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:25:10.003 --> 01:25:12.474
Oh, oh!

<i>Tell me you're getting this.

is this?</i>

01:26:57.810 --> 01:26:59.346

anything.</i>
