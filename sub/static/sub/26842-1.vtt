00:45.343 --> 00:50.016
<i>A 'paragon' is an entity,</i>

00:50.017 --> 00:54.656
<i>who led a just life or
suffered an untimely death</i>

00:54.657 --> 01:00.464
<i>for an unknown reason before
his allotted span of life.</i>

01:00.465 --> 01:05.504
<i>- King Yeomra -</i>

01:25.400 --> 01:27.168
<i>Why do you cry?</i>

01:31.009 --> 01:33.111
<i>Out of sorrow?</i>

01:34.046 --> 01:36.115
<i>Or do you feel wronged?</i>

01:41.457 --> 01:43.526
<i>Guardian! Sir!</i>

01:43.928 --> 01:46.764
<i>Please wake up! Guardian Gang-lim!</i>

01:47.233 --> 01:49.335
Gang-lim! Gang-lim!

01:49.603 --> 01:51.338
Sir! Are you okay?

01:51.339 --> 01:54.542
How does a guardian
get KOed with one hit!

01:57.815 --> 02:01.920
Cap, if your power nap
is over, could you help?

02:30.998 --> 02:34.235
FILIAL IMPIETY HELL

02:44.317 --> 02:45.318
Holy cow!

02:53.565 --> 02:54.699
Good day, sir.

03:17.801 --> 03:22.273
Your Majesty, these guardians
are terrorizing the Afterlife!

03:22.274 --> 03:24.643
How could they terrorize
their own realm?

03:24.844 --> 03:27.547
With a vengeful spirit, who
should be incinerated!

03:28.149 --> 03:31.353
Please approve the
trial of KIM Su-hong.

03:31.922 --> 03:34.691
His Notice of Death clearly
states that he's a paragon!

03:34.692 --> 03:38.630
No! This vengeful spirit is
disguised as a paragon...

03:38.631 --> 03:39.632
Did you ever consider!

03:40.668 --> 03:43.771
That he could've been
wrongfully murdered?

03:43.772 --> 03:47.477
No! He's just a victim of
a mishandled accident!

03:47.778 --> 03:49.013
An accidental killing!

03:49.514 --> 03:51.616
Stop sucking your thumb
and kneel properly!

03:53.120 --> 03:54.120
Get it together!

03:55.456 --> 03:59.829
I'll uncover the true
nature of his death.

04:00.397 --> 04:01.431
Allow him a fair trial.

04:10.946 --> 04:14.684
The crime of unjustly using
your service weapon,

04:15.486 --> 04:17.922
the crime of accompanying
a vengeful spirit,

04:17.923 --> 04:20.827
who caused turmoil in the
living world and here!

04:21.195 --> 04:25.367
Gang-lim, you are the one
who should he put on trial!

04:25.968 --> 04:27.804
Do not forget that!

04:30.108 --> 04:33.011
We'll accept any punishment
you bestow on us.

04:33.179 --> 04:37.251
So please grant KIM Su-hong's trial.

04:37.753 --> 04:40.489
There is a truth to be uncovered.

04:40.490 --> 04:42.125
Why? Why should we
accept his punishment?

04:42.126 --> 04:44.328
If I fail to do so, we'll
accept your punishment.

04:46.098 --> 04:48.635
We'll accept the punishment!

04:48.869 --> 04:50.971
Please allow him a
trial, Your Majesty...

04:51.506 --> 04:54.877
So there's truth to be uncovered?

04:56.581 --> 04:58.082
Let me ask the prosecution.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.083
Your Majesty.

04:59.251 --> 05:04.525
Are you absolutely certain
KIM's death was accidental?

05:05.627 --> 05:07.262
- Your...
- We'll risk our necks!

05:07.263 --> 05:08.731
Our necks?

05:14.173 --> 05:15.508
Very well!

05:15.642 --> 05:16.242
Pardon?

05:16.243 --> 05:17.945
I'll accept that as well.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.116
Why you little... It's my neck...

05:21.117 --> 05:24.655
As for the guardians,

05:24.656 --> 05:28.761
if you cannot prove his
wrongful death claim,

05:29.496 --> 05:31.598
what will you risk?

05:33.769 --> 05:35.237
We'll risk our guardianship.

05:41.447 --> 05:45.619
I will follow Gang-lim's wishes.

05:48.591 --> 05:50.660
What's the matter, Hewonmak?

05:51.696 --> 05:53.130
I'm so moved.

05:53.231 --> 05:55.167
Moved to my knees, Your Majesty.

05:55.535 --> 05:58.906
Of course I'll accept, that's my duty.

06:04.548 --> 06:05.916
There is a condition.

06:07.586 --> 06:13.494
Within the 49 days of his
trial, ascend a soul.

06:15.264 --> 06:16.432
HUR Choon-sam.

06:17.134 --> 06:20.443
You've already met him
in the living world.

06:28.751 --> 06:32.355
He has already surpassed his
allotted time on the registry.

06:33.992 --> 06:35.860
HUR Choon-sam!

06:35.861 --> 06:40.768
<i>His ascendance is revoked
by a household god.</i>

06:41.603 --> 06:45.408
So you're the household god, Sung-ju?

06:45.409 --> 06:51.050
<i>Humans worship him,
who is enshrined in a pot.</i>

06:51.051 --> 06:53.387
Damn, he's so cute.

06:56.025 --> 06:57.526
<i>In order to ascend HUR,</i>

06:57.527 --> 06:59.863
I've sent many guardians

07:02.167 --> 07:04.837
but none have come back
because of Sung-ju.

07:04.838 --> 07:06.005
Sung-ju?

07:06.006 --> 07:09.911
He even revealed
himself to the humans,

07:10.246 --> 07:12.381
<i>and is actively helping HUR's family.</i>

07:12.382 --> 07:13.984
Sir, don't push yourself.

07:13.985 --> 07:17.923
<i>He's an outlaw of the
Afterlife, eliminate him.</i>

07:18.425 --> 07:20.761
and ascend HUR in 49 days.

07:20.762 --> 07:22.697
Regardless of KIM's trial,

07:23.165 --> 07:27.337
you'll forfeit your rights to
reincarnations if you fail to do so.

07:27.338 --> 07:29.240
Is there ever any doubt?

07:29.808 --> 07:31.844
LEE Deok-choon, let's go with a smile.

07:31.845 --> 07:34.581
Find Sung-ju's true form,
it'll be in the house.

07:34.582 --> 07:36.784
I hope this is your last order.

07:36.785 --> 07:40.523
And I really hope this prick's
our 49th reincarnation.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.793
I want my reincarnation.

07:43.228 --> 07:44.830
Let's get a move on.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.136
Hey, isn't that yours?

07:50.339 --> 07:52.040
You gotta watch your stuff.

08:07.932 --> 08:10.468
Demolition...

08:10.736 --> 08:13.973
is murder...

08:14.408 --> 08:18.980
Just leave...

08:19.449 --> 08:21.284
Shithed...

08:22.687 --> 08:23.788
Shithed?

08:27.828 --> 08:28.828
Hyun-dong, come here.

08:29.564 --> 08:32.267
Sit here and look at the sunset.

08:32.268 --> 08:33.268
Okay!

08:59.842 --> 09:05.883
<i>Sung ju was a court painter
in his previous life.</i>

09:06.218 --> 09:08.454
<i>He painted the king.</i>

09:13.462 --> 09:18.001
He turned this redevelopment
town into his private gallery.

09:18.999 --> 09:22.636
This will be an easy job.

09:23.816 --> 09:27.239
It's so pretty, the
town's a gallery...

09:27.948 --> 09:31.327
No, Hewonmak! He's with a kid!

09:35.482 --> 09:36.917
Hyun-dong, come here!

09:41.737 --> 09:42.581
How is It?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.951
You're the best, Uncle Sung-ju!

♪ Where is the destination? ♪

09:47.880 --> 09:52.252

in front of the child.

10:17.771 --> 10:19.826
<i>Say it again!</i>

10:20.328 --> 10:23.231
You'll only go to applicable trials?

10:23.967 --> 10:26.002
Afterlife Law Article 3.6!

10:26.203 --> 10:28.039
A paragon suspected of an unjust death

10:28.140 --> 10:30.409
can choose to only take
on applicable trials.

10:30.744 --> 10:33.013
I was told it's a law created by you.

10:33.448 --> 10:35.917
I urge you not to break it.

10:36.619 --> 10:38.487
Prosecution.

10:38.956 --> 10:44.964
Are there any trials applicable
to the vengeful spirit's death?

10:44.998 --> 10:49.470
Yes, he's applicable in 2 trials.

10:49.672 --> 10:51.340
His crimes are considered grave,

10:51.508 --> 10:56.324
<i>one for not accepting his death, and
turning into a vengeful spirit.</i>

10:56.348 --> 10:57.883
and after his transformation,

10:58.418 --> 11:02.723
<i>he unleashed violence
on those in the living world.</i>

11:02.758 --> 11:04.025
Guardian Gang-lim,

11:04.227 --> 11:08.065
you'll need to cross 4 hells
with the vengeful spirit

11:08.066 --> 11:09.867
to reach the first trial.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.102
Do you get it?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.240
Hell ghouls will swarm in
to get a piece of him.

11:15.410 --> 11:16.077
Very well.

11:16.078 --> 11:17.078
What?

11:17.179 --> 11:18.180
Let's have it your way.

11:20.451 --> 11:21.451
However!

11:21.819 --> 11:24.623
If you cannot prove his unjust death,

11:25.191 --> 11:29.997
you won't be able to
clear his charges,

11:30.432 --> 11:32.868
and he'll be immediately
sent to eternal damnation,

11:33.103 --> 11:35.806
and you'll lose your guardianship.

11:37.242 --> 11:38.243
Will you accept?

11:39.946 --> 11:41.481
Yes, I accept.

11:41.482 --> 11:43.784
Wait, wait, stop!

11:44.019 --> 11:45.821
Why do you get to decide that?

11:46.423 --> 11:49.159
Non-retroactivity of law!

11:49.160 --> 11:51.596
A ruling can't overrule
past decisions,

11:51.597 --> 11:53.499
National Assembly Law, Article 92!

11:54.568 --> 11:55.168
My apologies!

11:55.169 --> 11:58.873
I know the law too!
I studied it! Article 92!

11:58.975 --> 12:00.409
Should I rip his mouth out?

12:01.078 --> 12:03.247
I could rip him to shreds...

12:03.281 --> 12:06.718
No, he'll be incinerated
even before his trial.

12:06.719 --> 12:11.392
With a vengeful spirit in the
Afterlife, storms will be prevalent,

12:11.493 --> 12:13.262
and what's that big
hell ghoul's name?

12:13.463 --> 12:15.465
Yeah, the big ass hell ghoul...

12:15.466 --> 12:17.267
That thing will come out!

12:25.013 --> 12:26.648
Prepare well for the trials.

12:27.684 --> 12:29.819
Your necks are on the line after all.

13:06.909 --> 13:10.446
Initiate the ascendance rite.

13:11.649 --> 13:15.454
His true form will be a pot,

13:16.490 --> 13:19.426
it won't be fun if
it's too easy to find.

13:23.534 --> 13:25.836
Found it! His true form!

13:27.473 --> 13:30.743
Either break it or drink it.

13:31.145 --> 13:32.613
Be gone, household god.

13:37.855 --> 13:41.493
Ascend him at once, he'll wake up...

13:47.336 --> 13:49.938
Look who it is.

13:51.776 --> 13:55.647
Let her go, or this breaks.

13:55.681 --> 13:59.519
Leave that alone, it's
the boy's piss pot.

14:00.889 --> 14:02.023
Why did you drink his piss?

14:04.995 --> 14:08.466
Buddy, let her go, that's child abuse!

14:08.868 --> 14:12.238
"Buddy"? Where are your manners?

14:13.641 --> 14:14.642
Don't remember me?

14:14.643 --> 14:15.677
What?

14:17.914 --> 14:19.282
Let her go!

14:19.951 --> 14:22.019
You'll wake him, be quiet.

14:40.418 --> 14:41.344
Come on!

14:53.768 --> 14:55.402
Uncle Sung-ju!

14:56.205 --> 14:57.639
Hey, Hyun-dong.

14:57.874 --> 15:02.179
I'm sorry, sir, please forgive us!

15:04.851 --> 15:09.123
I was the guardian when you
two died a millennium ago.

15:09.124 --> 15:11.593
Have some respect, you pricks.

15:11.861 --> 15:13.429
You really don't remember me?

15:13.430 --> 15:15.299
You know us?

15:16.234 --> 15:18.437
Wait, if you were a guardian,

15:18.438 --> 15:20.940
then you ascended us yourself?

15:25.047 --> 15:28.518
How could you be so rude
while kneeling before me?

15:28.753 --> 15:29.753
You're polarizing.

15:32.726 --> 15:35.996
So Yeomra completely
wiped your memories.

15:36.665 --> 15:38.199
You poor things.

15:39.202 --> 15:40.269
Too cruel.

15:41.105 --> 15:43.407
Yeomra's a cruel king.

15:44.121 --> 15:45.500
Does that idiot still grow his hair?

15:45.524 --> 15:46.524
Yes.

15:51.902 --> 15:52.688
Listen up.

15:54.737 --> 15:56.820
Wait until that kid
enters primary school.

15:57.327 --> 16:00.157
He couldn't go yet because
of how things are here.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.763
He can go in the 2nd semester.

16:03.443 --> 16:07.494
Wait until the gramps takes
him to the school in August.

16:08.523 --> 16:10.592
After that, do what you
will with the old man.

16:11.250 --> 16:14.086
I don't care about the old man,
Hyun-dong is the problem.

16:14.555 --> 16:17.368
Until then, I'm keeping this.

16:18.272 --> 16:21.976
If you're so desperate,
bring your captain.

16:24.069 --> 16:25.904
Yeomra himself will do too.

16:28.142 --> 16:32.714
How could he wipe your memories, huh?

16:33.659 --> 16:37.531
If this is the way you do
things, I can't cooperate.

16:37.556 --> 16:39.090
Look here, guardian.

16:39.468 --> 16:43.473
You say I was accidentally killed
but now you say otherwise,

16:43.665 --> 16:45.099
a secretive one, no less.

16:45.433 --> 16:49.304
So when asked what that is,

16:49.530 --> 16:52.233
you tell me to wait for the trial!

16:52.600 --> 16:54.368
Why? Why not?

16:55.048 --> 16:57.217
Because you won't
cooperate if you knew.

16:58.453 --> 16:59.554
It's too much for you.

17:00.155 --> 17:02.591
But if you're my lawyer,

17:02.826 --> 17:05.996
why can't you answer
your client's question?

17:06.442 --> 17:09.279
Are you even a certified lawyer?

17:09.558 --> 17:12.194
I'm starting to get suspicious.

17:15.545 --> 17:16.444
What's wrong?

17:16.480 --> 17:17.480
Weather!

17:18.348 --> 17:21.453
Because of weather?

17:21.854 --> 17:23.955
Never mind, I'll just continue.

17:24.090 --> 17:26.393
Don't take what I say the wrong way.

17:26.851 --> 17:28.819
You and I both practice law.

17:29.054 --> 17:31.257
I could tell you're a public defender.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.871
As you know, I passed
1st round of bar exam.

17:34.039 --> 17:37.710
I just want us to be faithful
to the basic principles.

17:38.156 --> 17:41.860
That's why I'm curious about you.

17:42.119 --> 17:44.822
Why? It's not weird for
the defendant to question

17:44.933 --> 17:47.702
the court-appointed lawyer
about his background.

17:47.826 --> 17:50.963
I don't even know your name or age.

17:51.175 --> 17:53.523
This feels a bit tight.

17:53.891 --> 17:56.760
The phrases I heard to death
over a millennium are,

17:56.840 --> 17:59.643
'Please save me,' 'Reincarnate me,'

18:00.423 --> 18:03.092
without exception, but not you.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.351
You're one of a kind.

18:06.187 --> 18:10.626
Reincarnate and work
like a dog? I'll pass.

18:10.861 --> 18:11.861
Also,

18:12.930 --> 18:15.433
I'm already dead, why'd I need saving?

18:15.768 --> 18:18.237
If I ask you to save
me, can you do that?

18:19.006 --> 18:20.006
Listen.

18:20.452 --> 18:24.857
As the keeper of secrets,
I want to know about you,

18:25.015 --> 18:27.952
and whether you're a capable lawyer.

18:27.986 --> 18:30.389
That's all I want to know.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.680
Save me!

19:11.117 --> 19:12.585
Please!

19:12.586 --> 19:14.220
See? No exception.

19:14.655 --> 19:16.157
Help me!

19:19.674 --> 19:21.075
Did you retrieve the pot?

19:21.632 --> 19:23.334
We lost the Notice of Death.

19:23.635 --> 19:24.869
Are you boasting?

19:24.870 --> 19:26.672
He's a millennium old household god,

19:26.673 --> 19:28.809
even Hewonmak was no match for him.

19:29.922 --> 19:32.124
Why is he protecting a dying man?

19:32.935 --> 19:36.372
Our subject has an adorable grandson.

19:36.397 --> 19:38.699
Sung-ju wants us to wait
until the boy enters school.

19:38.724 --> 19:40.726
For the sake of the boy.

19:40.794 --> 19:43.965
Then he'll return the Notice
and walk out of that house.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.735
Also, captain...

19:48.405 --> 19:50.341
- Don't!
- When will he enter?

19:50.675 --> 19:52.911
10th day next month,
which is in 40 days.

19:52.912 --> 19:55.114
We'll go back down and
find another solution.

19:55.983 --> 19:57.885
How many days till KIM's deadline?

19:59.188 --> 20:00.389
48 days.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.348
48 minus 40 is?

20:02.526 --> 20:03.727
8, I think?

20:03.728 --> 20:05.396
Help me! Please!

20:05.976 --> 20:08.144
So what's the problem?
That's plenty of time.

20:08.377 --> 20:09.378
Just sit tight.

20:09.403 --> 20:10.237
Mathematics is tough...

20:10.238 --> 20:14.076
It's basic arithmetic,
addition, subtraction.

20:14.077 --> 20:15.111
Right, arithmetic.

20:18.692 --> 20:19.726
Sir, in our past!

20:19.751 --> 20:22.588
We did wonderful work
in the past, why boast?

20:22.613 --> 20:24.281
Go and keep an eye on him.

20:24.773 --> 20:26.771
Beg, plea, and threaten.

20:26.796 --> 20:27.629
- Got it?
- But it's...

20:27.630 --> 20:29.065
Yes, sir!

20:29.466 --> 20:32.370
And if you find the
pot, smash it at once.

20:32.371 --> 20:33.839
- You two.
- Yes?

20:34.040 --> 20:36.075
Don't come back without the notice.

20:36.243 --> 20:39.514
- It's a warning.
- Understood!

20:48.595 --> 20:49.996
Don't come in!

20:50.033 --> 20:51.935
You sons of bitches!

20:52.188 --> 20:53.622
Get out of here!

20:53.892 --> 20:55.193
You bastards!

20:55.505 --> 20:57.178
Don't you dare come inside!

20:57.203 --> 20:59.271
You can talk to me.

20:59.563 --> 21:02.709
It's his debt, none of your business.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.319
He's my uncle!

21:05.386 --> 21:10.192
I know how much you've
been patient with him.

21:10.543 --> 21:13.486
Why is he suddenly so gentle?

21:13.601 --> 21:16.838
As a household god,
he can't hurt humans.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.482
He is supposed to protect all mankind.

21:18.507 --> 21:19.841
There's good news though.

21:20.689 --> 21:22.491
The mutual funds I invested in

21:23.735 --> 21:25.203
are showing signs of hope.

21:25.228 --> 21:27.552
So just be patient
for a few more days.

21:29.147 --> 21:31.190
- We can talk about this...
- Move aside.

21:31.295 --> 21:33.188
You can talk to me...

21:33.222 --> 21:34.905
Move aside, damn it!

21:34.930 --> 21:35.863
You shouldn't barge in...

21:35.888 --> 21:37.050
Stay the hell away!

21:39.728 --> 21:40.728
Sung-ju!

21:41.974 --> 21:42.774
Grandpa!

21:42.775 --> 21:43.775
Sung-ju!

21:45.346 --> 21:47.682
What are you doing?

21:48.350 --> 21:49.050
Shit!

21:49.051 --> 21:50.552
Someone pull him out.

21:53.057 --> 21:57.418
He touched human feces,
he'll become weaker.

22:02.004 --> 22:03.004
<i>KIM Su-hong.</i>

22:04.741 --> 22:08.913
I'll explain for the last
time, so listen carefully.

22:10.483 --> 22:14.889
First, I cannot tell you the
secret behind your death

22:15.057 --> 22:16.201
- until the trial...
- Until the trial!

22:16.225 --> 22:18.106
No! The trial... I'll go...

22:18.395 --> 22:20.063
I'll wait until the trial...

22:20.398 --> 22:21.398
Secondly,

22:26.696 --> 22:27.764
who am I?

22:28.209 --> 22:29.711
Just like you,

22:30.345 --> 22:33.248
I was wrongfully murdered
by my selfish brother,

22:33.484 --> 22:35.918
I was General Gang-lim
of Goryeo dynasty.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.129
That's the extend of
what I can tell you.

22:42.163 --> 22:43.836
Let's get a move on.

24:09.594 --> 24:10.594
Can I help you?

24:13.966 --> 24:15.735
What did I tell you
about coming back here?

24:15.736 --> 24:18.172
I have an irresistible proposition.

24:18.406 --> 24:19.907
It better be good.

24:20.409 --> 24:22.388
Or you won't ever return
to the Afterlife.

24:22.412 --> 24:24.381
We'll wait till the boy's entrance.

24:25.216 --> 24:27.118
That's already settled.

24:27.153 --> 24:29.622
In addition, even after
ascending Mr. HUR,

24:29.623 --> 24:32.359
we'll continue to find
a solution for the boy,

24:32.427 --> 24:35.631
a special 1-on-1 service until
he can stand on his own.

24:35.665 --> 24:37.801
Instead of a funeral right
after his first day at school,

24:37.802 --> 24:40.238
this is far more humane way.

24:41.707 --> 24:43.242
No strings attached.

24:43.744 --> 24:45.078
Tell us about our past.

24:46.682 --> 24:47.849
I knew this'd happen.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.184
Let grandpa go!

24:49.185 --> 24:52.279
What'd be like for him
to limp to school?

24:52.359 --> 24:52.867
What?!

24:52.892 --> 24:54.438
How'd you feel?

24:54.560 --> 24:55.840
Son of a bitch!

24:55.865 --> 24:57.348
I'll kill you!

24:57.381 --> 25:00.218
Has this old man gone mad?

25:00.736 --> 25:02.003
Grandpa!

25:02.004 --> 25:03.439
What's with this place today?

25:05.709 --> 25:06.709
Who are you?

25:06.734 --> 25:09.770
Look, from loan sharks
to demolition crew,

25:09.849 --> 25:12.185
people are lining up
to ruin the boy's life.

25:12.286 --> 25:14.722
Miss, who are you?

25:15.049 --> 25:16.063
You don't know her either?

25:16.087 --> 25:18.277
I know you can't hurt humans.

25:20.468 --> 25:21.702
Hewonmak! Hurry!

25:22.134 --> 25:22.791
Deal?

25:22.982 --> 25:24.681
- Who are you talking to?
- Decide now, deal?

25:24.705 --> 25:26.267
- Hurry! Hewonmak!
- Deal?

25:26.442 --> 25:30.345
- Do you see someone there?
- Please hurry!

25:32.416 --> 25:34.151
Fine, deal.

25:34.419 --> 25:35.420
Okay, deal.

25:37.090 --> 25:38.391
Attention, please!

25:38.659 --> 25:40.627
You're gonna do what
to the boy's legs?

25:41.793 --> 25:43.331
Who here had their legs broken?

25:44.055 --> 25:46.786
It actually hurts more than you think.

25:47.405 --> 25:51.510
Where are these rats coming out of?

25:52.546 --> 25:53.947
Who are you?

26:01.982 --> 26:02.982
What the hell?

26:23.134 --> 26:24.394
Show off!

26:24.594 --> 26:28.098
I'll break your arms, then your spine,

26:28.132 --> 26:29.967
and lastly your neck.

26:30.169 --> 26:34.382
If you'd like to tour hell,
come back 3 more times, okay?

26:35.810 --> 26:38.780
My leg! Ow! My leg!

26:54.839 --> 26:55.840
Hold on!

26:56.607 --> 26:59.177
As per our deal, who was I?

27:01.326 --> 27:02.527
Let me wash my hand.

27:03.263 --> 27:04.697
Who was I?!

27:12.565 --> 27:16.737
Goryeo dynasty's fiercest
warrior, Hewonmak!

27:17.617 --> 27:19.452
Looks like you still got it.

27:20.743 --> 27:22.745
Do you know what your
enemies called you?

27:24.060 --> 27:25.194
White Wildcat.

27:34.782 --> 27:37.369
<i>It's White Wildcat!</i>

27:41.764 --> 27:44.511
<i>You were a terrifying warrior,</i>

27:44.618 --> 27:47.689
<i>who defended the Northern border.</i>

27:57.430 --> 27:59.242
<i>When you appeared on the battlefield,</i>

27:59.267 --> 28:01.536
<i>the Jurchens lost their morale,</i>

28:01.704 --> 28:03.539
<i>and fled to save themselves.</i>

28:14.557 --> 28:17.293
<i>Retreat! Hurry!</i>

28:19.965 --> 28:21.366
Sever the Achilles heels

28:24.138 --> 28:28.777
of our prisoners and
send them to Gyekyung.

28:34.553 --> 28:35.654
<i>White Wildcat...</i>

28:36.523 --> 28:40.528
You always wore white
wildcat fur scarf.

28:42.098 --> 28:43.332
So that's why...

28:44.210 --> 28:45.745
My neck always felt weird,

28:45.837 --> 28:48.439
as if it's lacking something.

28:48.541 --> 28:49.541
WHITE WILDKAT

28:49.909 --> 28:51.878
With a C, idiot.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.858
Not wildkat, it's wildcat, like a cat.

28:56.619 --> 28:59.322
He'll be in school soon, but
he can't even spell properly.

29:00.525 --> 29:02.427
Sever Achilles heel!

29:02.495 --> 29:04.664
This tendon right here.

29:04.765 --> 29:07.334
Right here!

29:07.469 --> 29:08.670
White Wildcat, eh?

29:14.414 --> 29:16.677
Sever. Sever it!

29:17.345 --> 29:18.345
What's with him?

29:31.605 --> 29:33.006
INDOLENCE HELL

29:44.257 --> 29:45.257
Indolence Hell,

29:46.260 --> 29:50.231
it judges those who
waste away their lives.

29:51.067 --> 29:52.568
People like you.

29:53.470 --> 29:55.706
Wait, you failed the bar 8 times.

29:56.408 --> 29:59.278
I passed the 1st round,
it just took 8 tries.

30:00.681 --> 30:04.085
I scanned your past,
you were quite lazy.

30:04.787 --> 30:05.721
Never did any work,

30:05.722 --> 30:08.792
and took money from your
brother to study law.

30:09.795 --> 30:12.731
You'd have easily gotten
a 20-year sentence here.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.502
And run alongside those people.

30:16.705 --> 30:20.543
But we're merely passing
by thanks to me.

30:21.178 --> 30:22.880
You'll get a fair trial.

30:23.414 --> 30:25.450
And be reincarnated.

30:26.414 --> 30:27.597
No, I don't want it...

30:31.761 --> 30:33.662
I don't want to be reborn.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.433
Do you get it now?

30:37.302 --> 30:41.808
This is why you became the
security expert in the Afterlife.

30:42.243 --> 30:43.410
Goryeo's greatest warrior.

30:44.012 --> 30:46.548
Right, I was a warrior!

30:46.549 --> 30:49.252
I'm quite moved, even
though it's my story.

30:51.957 --> 30:54.260
How could he turn like that?

30:54.595 --> 30:55.628
What's wrong with me?

30:55.629 --> 30:59.100
I became like this after saving
worthless souls for a millennium.

31:00.270 --> 31:04.375
Uncle, grandpa's awake.

31:04.710 --> 31:08.014
Bring him his pee pot and go to sleep.

31:12.121 --> 31:14.924
As per our deal, let's hear it.

31:16.227 --> 31:17.227
What'll you do with him?

31:18.163 --> 31:19.497
What's your plan?

31:19.932 --> 31:21.867
That special 1-on-1 service.

31:25.307 --> 31:27.977
Why did you take human form?
Let's hear that first.

31:28.612 --> 31:30.914
The boy's mom died after giving birth,

31:33.185 --> 31:36.623
and his dad fled to the
Philippines due to gambling debt.

31:38.226 --> 31:40.362
So that's why.

31:41.564 --> 31:46.771
To lend a hand, to help them out.

31:50.845 --> 31:55.317
I didn't want to, I knew I shouldn't,

31:56.086 --> 31:57.988
but at the end of the
old man's natural life,

31:58.823 --> 32:01.393
demolition crew moved in.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.698
<i>We only got a small compensation.</i>

32:05.300 --> 32:07.368
You took the money, get out of here!

32:07.369 --> 32:09.972
<i>And the boy got sick too.</i>

32:11.070 --> 32:13.839
<i>In the modern 21st Century Korea,</i>

32:14.368 --> 32:16.995
<i>how does he get measles?</i>

32:17.952 --> 32:19.987
<i>I couldn't help but
come out of the pot.</i>

32:20.277 --> 32:21.278
<i>Where's the compensation?</i>

32:22.379 --> 32:24.881
For selling this house!

32:24.906 --> 32:26.808
It's not much, don't mind that.

32:28.534 --> 32:29.535
It's $100,000.

32:34.966 --> 32:37.702
I bought mutual funds and
stocks in emerging markets.

32:38.082 --> 32:41.853
When the old man ascends,
I have to leave too,

32:42.366 --> 32:44.235
how could I leave the
boy with petty change?

32:44.558 --> 32:46.078
$100,000 isn't all that much nowadays.

32:46.895 --> 32:50.766
I barely convinced the old man
and made the investment.

32:52.436 --> 32:53.570
But the value halved...

32:56.242 --> 32:59.112
No, almost 70% loss...

32:59.580 --> 33:03.852
So that's why you took
out private loans.

33:05.356 --> 33:07.992
The mutual funds will recover.

33:08.093 --> 33:10.128
It's a temporary liquidity crisis.

33:10.129 --> 33:11.731
A minor setback.

33:12.399 --> 33:15.837
A god getting involved
in mutual funds? Liquidity?

33:16.005 --> 33:17.372
How could you say that?

33:17.485 --> 33:19.787
That money could've gone
to buying an apartment!

33:20.122 --> 33:23.459
What the hell do you know
about real economy?!

33:24.017 --> 33:28.723
I lived through the IMF and
Lehman Brothers crises!

33:29.491 --> 33:33.096
Apartment? That one? That one too?

33:34.110 --> 33:37.180
Real estate market will
crash, it's a bubble!

33:37.713 --> 33:39.348
It's still worrying.

33:39.416 --> 33:42.319
Yeomra said not to meddle
with the stock market,

33:42.344 --> 33:43.745
even he can't figure it out.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.892
To cover up the losses,

33:46.917 --> 33:49.854
You're $300,000 in debt!

33:57.275 --> 34:00.045
The mutual funds will
rise, they will!

34:00.070 --> 34:02.172
It's a waiting game!

34:02.674 --> 34:05.277
Isn't that obvious?

34:09.717 --> 34:12.987
Fine, then what do you propose?

34:13.824 --> 34:14.824
Let's hear it!

34:21.000 --> 34:21.500
SUNNY ORPHANAGE

34:21.502 --> 34:23.437
Openage?

34:25.341 --> 34:26.341
Come on, let's go!

34:27.476 --> 34:28.478
Hurry!

34:28.980 --> 34:29.980
Hyun-dong...

34:30.415 --> 34:31.416
Piggyback!

34:34.688 --> 34:36.089
So, if his father

34:37.359 --> 34:42.498
is still his legal guardian, the
boy can't be accepted, right?

34:43.268 --> 34:48.107
So his father has to
forfeit his custody?

34:51.947 --> 34:55.685
But he left the country,
and we can't find him!

34:56.187 --> 34:59.224
That's the rule, we must follow it.

35:00.527 --> 35:01.527
Let's go.

35:01.828 --> 35:02.829
Wait a minute.

35:03.564 --> 35:05.433
If his father can't raise him,

35:05.968 --> 35:09.072
can you obtain a
document proving that?

35:10.775 --> 35:11.776
Document?

35:13.212 --> 35:15.414
Where do we obtain it?

35:16.250 --> 35:18.419
Straight from him, of course.

35:19.321 --> 35:20.322
The father.

35:21.958 --> 35:22.959
That again?

35:24.996 --> 35:25.997
Let's go.

35:27.521 --> 35:28.788
Then his grandfather!

35:30.538 --> 35:35.244
He's listed as a cohabitant,
but he's a senior, right?

35:35.445 --> 35:38.348
If you can prove he's
physically incapable,

35:38.683 --> 35:41.486
the town office can
put him on welfare.

35:41.988 --> 35:44.157
At least he won't starve.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.630
His guardian is needed to
send him to the orphanage?

35:49.232 --> 35:51.034
If he has one, why
bother coming here?

35:52.237 --> 35:54.166
It wasn't all useless though.

35:54.316 --> 35:58.440
That info about welfare
is pretty sweet.

35:59.681 --> 36:03.586
Even after a millennium,
she has not changed.

36:13.568 --> 36:17.383
<i>When Goryeo cavalry
ambushed a Jurchen village,</i>

36:17.407 --> 36:20.711
<i>you took all the children to safety.</i>

36:27.489 --> 36:31.995
Even in a dangerous situation,
you only thought of them.

36:32.096 --> 36:35.811
I knew it, she felt
like a barbarian type.

36:35.835 --> 36:36.835
Barbarian style.

36:41.844 --> 36:43.846
You were leader of the orphans,

36:45.081 --> 36:48.552
a ray of hope to kids
who lost their parents.

36:51.030 --> 36:52.631
<i>The day after the attack,</i>

36:53.424 --> 36:57.074
<i>you brought them deep
inside a mountain,</i>

36:57.099 --> 37:00.349
<i>where Goryeo soldiers
wouldn't come looking.</i>

37:01.846 --> 37:04.316
<i>Very deep in the woods.</i>

37:05.712 --> 37:07.681
<i>You died at the age of 18,</i>

37:08.717 --> 37:12.855
so you were their mother
for 3 solid years.

37:15.727 --> 37:19.432
<i>You didn't care about yourself,
only the children...</i>

37:20.301 --> 37:22.436
<i>You sacrificed for them.</i>

37:31.350 --> 37:32.785
Why did you mention that?

37:44.036 --> 37:46.626
DECEIT HELL

37:47.079 --> 37:50.386
You feel pain but no
scar, isn't that weird?

37:52.849 --> 37:53.850
KIM Su-hong!

37:54.552 --> 37:57.889
I'll tell you in time
why you died unjustly.

37:59.526 --> 38:00.960
No need to find out early.

38:01.896 --> 38:02.896
What will you do for me?

38:06.737 --> 38:10.074
If I comply, what'll you do for me?

38:13.647 --> 38:14.647
Reincarnation.

38:15.717 --> 38:16.951
You'll be reincarnated.

38:18.527 --> 38:22.941
I've told you again and again,
either tell me what happened,

38:23.459 --> 38:29.111
or who you are, but you
say the same crap,

38:29.136 --> 38:33.175
reincarnation...

38:34.544 --> 38:36.546
Reincarnation!

38:39.953 --> 38:41.354
I don't need it!

38:41.355 --> 38:42.355
KIM Su-hong!

38:51.837 --> 38:55.508
Alright, I'll tell you my story.

39:08.239 --> 39:09.239
My father...

39:12.134 --> 39:16.172
was a general of
Goryeo's special army,

39:16.173 --> 39:21.347
and commander of the war
against the Khitans.

39:24.853 --> 39:25.853
YALU RIVER FRONTLINE

39:26.133 --> 39:29.036
<i>Brave and sympathetic,</i>

39:29.415 --> 39:32.552
<i>he earned respect and
trust from everyone,</i>

39:34.176 --> 39:35.978
<i>When I was old enough to ride a horse,</i>

39:36.003 --> 39:37.971
<i>he led me into all battles,</i>

39:38.573 --> 39:39.307
<i>Advance!</i>

39:39.308 --> 39:43.680
<i>and hoped that I'd follow his
footstep to become a general.</i>

40:00.583 --> 40:04.354
<i>His special army was a huge
threat to the Khitans.</i>

40:04.990 --> 40:09.863
<i>Facing inevitable defeat,
they knelt before him.</i>

40:10.643 --> 40:12.044
Let them go.

40:12.245 --> 40:13.245
Father...

40:16.663 --> 40:20.334
Khitans' fate is all but sealed.

40:21.938 --> 40:26.143
There's no need for
unnecessary bloodshed.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.229
<i>He was wise and benevolent,</i>

40:32.832 --> 40:35.368
<i>but I didn't understand
why he needed to</i>

40:36.655 --> 40:40.006
<i>show mercy to our enemies.</i>

40:40.331 --> 40:42.467
<i>I bet you butt heads a lot.</i>

40:43.335 --> 40:47.771
A thoughtful and humane
father and by the book son.

40:48.643 --> 40:50.545
You even analyzed me during all this?

40:51.514 --> 40:56.053
You're strictly by the book type.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.023
Am I right?

40:59.560 --> 41:00.560
Got a question.

41:01.029 --> 41:03.331
So what about your petty brother?

41:05.936 --> 41:08.272
KHITAN VILLAGE
NEAR YALU RIVER

41:11.443 --> 41:13.943
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

41:15.272 --> 41:16.206
<i>Stop!</i>

41:16.231 --> 41:17.231
<i>Please...</i>

41:22.861 --> 41:25.898
"Don't suffer anymore,
I'm sorry," he said.

41:33.043 --> 41:34.177
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

41:46.630 --> 41:49.800
What happened to his parents?

41:51.457 --> 41:52.023
<i>Boy!</i>

41:52.472 --> 41:53.939
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

41:55.643 --> 41:58.646
<i>They passed away...</i>

41:58.714 --> 41:59.748
He doesn't have any.

42:03.889 --> 42:07.192
<i>Father took in the Khitan orphan.</i>

42:08.184 --> 42:10.148
<i>That was how everything started.</i>

42:14.461 --> 42:15.047
Good.

42:15.072 --> 42:18.051
Try writing consonants
and vowels separately,

42:18.076 --> 42:19.116
so you don't get confused.

42:19.367 --> 42:20.681
Miss!

42:20.909 --> 42:22.078
Miss?

42:23.028 --> 42:25.130
Okay, kiddo.

42:28.191 --> 42:29.914
I don't believe this!

42:35.245 --> 42:37.314
Old man! The other way!

42:37.702 --> 42:38.702
What's with him?

42:39.356 --> 42:41.063
How many times
do I have to tell you?

42:41.087 --> 42:44.424
You got no hearing on the right,
and a little bit on the left!

42:44.492 --> 42:46.561
But I hear you fine, idiot.

42:46.586 --> 42:49.389
That's why we're practicing!

42:50.369 --> 42:51.670
Let's go again.

42:52.428 --> 42:57.033
<i>Sgt. KIM 's body was found
behind the base 2 days ago,</i>

42:57.034 --> 42:59.938
<i>and crime scene recreation
took place today.</i>

43:02.821 --> 43:06.058
His brother's body is barely cold...

43:09.520 --> 43:14.520
CRIME SCENE RECREATION
WITH SUSPECT TODAY

43:14.961 --> 43:16.370
CO-CONSPIRATOR PVT. WON UNDERGOING
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION

43:16.616 --> 43:19.045
What in the world...

43:20.203 --> 43:26.239
Why isn't the Grim Reaper
taking those guys away?

43:32.459 --> 43:33.459
Checkmate.

43:40.274 --> 43:42.910
Who told you to kneel in
front of your brother?

43:44.548 --> 43:45.582
Sit comfortably.

43:47.504 --> 43:48.538
Yes, father.

43:54.753 --> 43:58.391
<i>After he moved in, I had
to give up many things.</i>

44:16.786 --> 44:21.659
Spread your legs widely
to maintain balance,

44:22.027 --> 44:26.399
and the sword should be
pointed towards the enemy.

44:28.603 --> 44:32.608
For a single reason of
not having any parents,

44:33.377 --> 44:35.446
father favored him
more than necessary.

44:37.450 --> 44:38.984
Just stick with facts!

44:39.586 --> 44:44.259
Leave the judgment
to the listener.

44:45.028 --> 44:46.095
Got it?

44:47.598 --> 44:49.767
What happened next?

44:50.569 --> 44:54.280
Why does this old
story feel so fresh?

44:54.486 --> 44:56.254
It's like a page turner!

44:57.012 --> 45:01.885
So what happened after his lessons?

45:12.068 --> 45:13.102
Checkmate.

45:19.369 --> 45:20.295
Out of check.

45:23.184 --> 45:24.218
Checkmate.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.354
Out of check.

45:30.328 --> 45:31.930
Why don't you ever attack?

45:40.276 --> 45:42.278
Why do you always defend?!

45:43.158 --> 45:44.191
Out of check.

45:46.118 --> 45:49.022
What strategy is this?
A barbaric tactic?

45:50.725 --> 45:53.028
How long will you just defend?
Answer me.

45:54.197 --> 45:55.231
Answer me!

45:56.000 --> 45:58.169
Father never taught you to attack?!

46:02.576 --> 46:04.211
<i>In all battles,</i>

46:04.713 --> 46:06.748
our victory is
determined by the enemy.

46:07.089 --> 46:08.122
What?

46:08.545 --> 46:10.113
Always remember,

46:10.491 --> 46:12.151
Don't be fixated on winning...

46:12.205 --> 46:15.463
Don't be fixated on
winning nor my tactics.

46:16.464 --> 46:18.029
Read your opponent...

46:18.054 --> 46:19.923
Reading my opponent
and analyzing his tactics,

46:20.503 --> 46:22.271
are the virtues of a general,

46:23.708 --> 46:25.142
father taught me that.

46:37.028 --> 46:40.064
<i>Barbarian's survival instinct!</i>

46:40.432 --> 46:45.418
So you're saying you died
because of an orphan kid?

46:45.741 --> 46:47.876
By the way, what's with the sword?

46:48.367 --> 46:49.407
Are you expecting company?

46:50.714 --> 46:53.384
All thanks to you being
a vengeful spirit.

46:53.528 --> 46:55.163
Hell ghouls will pop up constantly.

46:55.460 --> 46:58.697
And this place will be crawling
with everything you're afraid of.

46:58.722 --> 47:00.117
Just you watch, you idiot!

47:02.354 --> 47:04.456
That's why you pulled it out.

47:05.003 --> 47:06.170
Put it away.

47:06.471 --> 47:08.440
I'm afraid of nothing.

47:11.300 --> 47:15.238
Mr. Guardian, get used
to your new client.

47:15.986 --> 47:17.019
Don't you know me?

47:17.054 --> 47:18.088
I was a vengeful spirit.

47:22.295 --> 47:23.362
You sure?

47:24.865 --> 47:29.071
I'm not scared of
things that exist.

47:29.973 --> 47:32.242
If there was, they'd
have come already.

47:41.534 --> 47:43.336
Everyone's leaving.

47:44.328 --> 47:45.328
Grandpa!

47:50.203 --> 47:52.005
Do it slowly, kiddo.

47:58.906 --> 48:00.231
Granny...

48:00.719 --> 48:04.189
Live a good life, don't get sick.

48:05.793 --> 48:09.382
She doesn't have to wait
for her sons anymore.

48:12.535 --> 48:15.091
Granny, be well.

48:17.377 --> 48:18.477
Those who meet...

48:20.248 --> 48:22.684
Must part at some point.

48:23.628 --> 48:24.896
Those who part...

48:24.921 --> 48:29.928
Sure, they part...

48:32.332 --> 48:34.601
Those who part...

48:39.976 --> 48:43.414
Focus on the topic,
you're the only holdout.

48:43.828 --> 48:47.371
Those who part, will return.

48:49.235 --> 48:51.871
Right, we'll meet again,

48:52.362 --> 48:53.596
it's a cycle.

48:53.964 --> 48:55.199
Those who part...

48:56.101 --> 48:59.372
Whatever, how did we meet?

49:00.151 --> 49:02.754
How did a Jurchen orphan
and a Goryeo-warrior meet?

50:33.980 --> 50:36.182
Thank you so much!

50:40.268 --> 50:42.036
It's a Jurchen kid, boss.

50:43.212 --> 50:44.547
Are you from Goryeo?

50:45.304 --> 50:47.235
Thank you! Thank you!

50:47.328 --> 50:49.370
I came to look for food! Thank you!

50:49.718 --> 50:53.451
Take me to your hideout.

51:27.216 --> 51:30.954
They're Jurchen children,
we should root them out.

51:37.307 --> 51:38.708
I'll do it myself.

52:12.759 --> 52:14.995
Come here, help yourselves!

52:16.799 --> 52:20.837
Even if you're hungry,
you must cook the meat.

52:22.340 --> 52:26.011
Grind the bones and use
the powder on wounds.

52:27.381 --> 52:32.221
Give that tiger fur to whoever
is going out to hunt.

52:34.091 --> 52:35.125
And never,

52:37.573 --> 52:39.469
ever come back down south.

52:59.395 --> 53:02.862
Uncle, tell me more!

53:04.036 --> 53:05.649
Why are you up there?

53:06.237 --> 53:07.437
Stop being a poser, come down!

53:09.356 --> 53:10.356
Douchebag.

53:17.043 --> 53:18.043
Stay back.

53:18.645 --> 53:19.922
Good to see you.

53:20.861 --> 53:22.896
It's been a while, I was getting worried.

53:22.897 --> 53:25.366
Leave, just leave, get out of here!

53:25.367 --> 53:30.111
If you're worried, just leave!

53:30.575 --> 53:31.776
Uncle!

53:33.212 --> 53:34.914
Oh no!

53:35.415 --> 53:37.248
You're bad!

53:38.787 --> 53:39.821
Enough!

53:40.990 --> 53:41.724
Back again?

53:41.749 --> 53:43.977
Came back for a tour of hell?

53:45.531 --> 53:46.598
Remember?

53:46.888 --> 53:48.564
It's not them! Stop!

53:48.835 --> 53:49.869
Who are you?

53:50.872 --> 53:51.872
It's not them...

54:03.691 --> 54:06.905
We'll pay back the debt once
the mutual funds recover,

54:06.929 --> 54:10.500
and the interest will be paid
once the Chinese market recovers.

54:10.902 --> 54:13.938
I broke your arms as I promised,

54:14.626 --> 54:18.421
so don't ever come back here.

54:18.782 --> 54:20.798
We're the demolition crew!

54:21.106 --> 54:22.922
Hired by the city!

54:22.947 --> 54:24.345
I told you...

54:24.856 --> 54:26.190
We aren't the loan sharks!

54:27.757 --> 54:30.861
He attacked the
authority, that idiot...

54:37.408 --> 54:41.646
When I think carefully, I do have one.

54:42.248 --> 54:43.282
Something I'm afraid of.

54:43.684 --> 54:46.286
No, no, you're wrong.

54:46.287 --> 54:47.689
No need to think carefully.

54:47.923 --> 54:48.924
Just relax.

54:48.958 --> 54:50.159
This nagging thought...

54:50.638 --> 54:51.705
No, don't do that.

54:52.363 --> 54:54.532
You said you're not afraid
of anything, right?

54:55.067 --> 54:58.071
At least the things that still exist.

54:58.873 --> 55:00.374
But there's one,

55:01.443 --> 55:04.213
a reptile that's extinct.

55:08.287 --> 55:10.623
You're not a fan of frogs?

55:10.791 --> 55:13.994
Frogs are still around,
and they're amphibian.

55:14.496 --> 55:16.965
Is that right? Let's get a move on.

55:16.966 --> 55:18.167
Have you seen Jurassic Park?

55:19.136 --> 55:20.604
I got no time for movies, let's go.

55:20.605 --> 55:22.707
Dinosaurs that are extinct.

55:24.311 --> 55:27.147
Especially the raptors.

55:33.591 --> 55:34.792
They're carnivorous...

55:35.895 --> 55:37.396
Jesus!

55:38.231 --> 55:40.233
I get goosebumps, even when I'm dead.

55:40.435 --> 55:42.103
Raptor? Just one?

55:43.840 --> 55:48.178
No, they hunt in packs.

55:50.950 --> 55:53.687
They were expert group hunters.

55:53.821 --> 55:55.356
Do you know how fast they were?

55:56.291 --> 56:00.163
Their top speed is 70 km/h!

56:11.815 --> 56:14.785
KIM, don't look back,
and don't move at all!

56:14.786 --> 56:15.653
What's wrong?

56:15.654 --> 56:16.788
Don't ever look behind you!

56:18.992 --> 56:20.026
What is that?

56:22.096 --> 56:24.866
What?! What the hell?!

56:27.928 --> 56:30.876
I can't hear you, I just don't!

56:31.133 --> 56:33.353
Not a damn thing!

56:35.926 --> 56:37.261
Then sir!

56:37.362 --> 56:39.197
Aside from hearing problem,

56:39.222 --> 56:41.691
do you have any other
physical problems?

56:47.434 --> 56:49.002
If you have a lot of problems,

56:49.003 --> 56:51.773
you could get a lot more welfare...

56:52.108 --> 56:55.312
My knees ache, it's unbearable.

56:55.446 --> 56:57.648
That's an understatement.

56:59.719 --> 57:03.691
What about the big nail
injury you get some time ago?

57:03.692 --> 57:08.875
I'm fine, I got a shot
and got medicated too.

57:08.899 --> 57:11.536
Do you suddenly hear whispers?

57:12.104 --> 57:13.605
No! Nothing at all!

57:14.074 --> 57:15.976
I don't hear anything again!

57:16.489 --> 57:19.459
So give me the welfare check!

57:20.250 --> 57:21.283
Give me a sec.

57:23.540 --> 57:27.177
You there! Mr. HUR's companions!

57:27.202 --> 57:29.338
Three of you! Come see me!

57:29.363 --> 57:30.697
Don't pretend to be deaf!

57:30.722 --> 57:31.722
Me?

57:33.002 --> 57:34.002
Okay...

57:34.604 --> 57:36.740
He wants you.

57:38.788 --> 57:40.456
Foreign adoption?

57:40.580 --> 57:45.920
He'll adapt to anything at
his age, it's a good chance.

57:46.489 --> 57:50.026
Local adoption will be
hard due to his age.

57:50.995 --> 57:54.834
So we should send him abroad?

57:55.590 --> 57:58.928
Either his grandpa or
guardian has to sign off.

58:00.142 --> 58:00.742
Guardian?

58:00.743 --> 58:04.781
I'm offering an option
because I know his family.

58:05.796 --> 58:07.497
- Guardian.
- Yup, legal guardian.

58:18.369 --> 58:19.529
KIM Su-hong! Close your eyes!

58:19.554 --> 58:21.925
Your eyes! Close them!

58:26.815 --> 58:28.183
KIM! Stop right there!

58:28.885 --> 58:29.919
Stop?

58:30.187 --> 58:31.221
Yeah! Stop!

59:05.740 --> 59:07.007
Tyrannosaurus...

59:13.818 --> 59:15.887
Is there anything bigger?

59:48.440 --> 59:49.440
Adaption?

59:49.961 --> 59:52.164
Are you all nuts?

59:52.743 --> 59:58.384
I'm still alive, why should
I give my child away?

59:59.153 --> 01:00:01.579
That's why you must stay alive...

01:00:01.604 --> 01:00:04.794
When I was young and penniless,

01:00:05.228 --> 01:00:10.969
I raised the boy's father with
my own hands, you pricks!

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:15.108
You should've worked hard
when you were young,

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:16.978
you wasted away your life,

01:00:16.979 --> 01:00:18.947
that's the cause of all
your misfortune now!

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.133
Let go!

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.327
- How dare you!
- Stay back!

01:00:23.255 --> 01:00:26.659
Your sight is bad, right?
It comes with the age.

01:00:26.803 --> 01:00:28.671
Do you know why you get farsighted?

01:00:28.839 --> 01:00:32.544
As you get older, you
must look far ahead.

01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:33.703
Big picture.

01:00:33.937 --> 01:00:37.842
Let's look far into Hyun-dong's life.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.769
Foreign adoption is...

01:00:49.738 --> 01:00:52.875
HUR Choon-sam! You insolent!

01:00:54.112 --> 01:00:59.179
Do you know who I am?!

01:01:01.196 --> 01:01:03.532
It's a divine secret! Don't do it!

01:01:03.557 --> 01:01:05.392
You're just a child!

01:01:05.417 --> 01:01:08.888
You're a petty soul! I've had it!

01:01:08.889 --> 01:01:10.290
- No!
- Shut up!

01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:12.025
HUR Choon-sam!

01:01:12.362 --> 01:01:16.010
I helped redeem so many
guilty souls over a millennium...

01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:21.813
Don't you even have a father?!

01:01:21.971 --> 01:01:22.938
I'm sorry, sir!

01:01:22.963 --> 01:01:24.570
He acts up whenever it rains.

01:01:24.595 --> 01:01:27.516
He got into an accident on a rainy day!

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.990
He injured his head.

01:01:29.023 --> 01:01:30.217
It cracked opened, sir.

01:01:31.645 --> 01:01:32.679
I'm sorry!

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:42.337
Him being my grandson
isn't important.

01:01:43.238 --> 01:01:48.399
It's the fact that
I'm his grandfather.

01:02:08.378 --> 01:02:11.515
Inside a dinosaur's belly...

01:02:13.175 --> 01:02:17.223
Inside a mosasaurus' belly,
the biggest dinosaur ever.

01:02:18.637 --> 01:02:20.072
I must be the first.

01:02:20.452 --> 01:02:23.288
Congrats, so many firsts
after arriving here.

01:02:24.524 --> 01:02:26.159
I hope I don't get digested.

01:02:27.193 --> 01:02:30.476
It'll take us safely to the
edge of Betrayal Hell,

01:02:30.477 --> 01:02:32.145
we'll get off there.

01:02:35.874 --> 01:02:37.909
Edge of betrayal...

01:02:38.544 --> 01:02:40.079
Betrayal...

01:02:46.322 --> 01:02:47.148
KIM Su-hong.

01:02:47.907 --> 01:02:52.743
How'd you feel if Lt. PARK
and Pvt. WON betrayed you?

01:02:53.893 --> 01:02:55.928
Are you implying they betrayed me?

01:03:00.734 --> 01:03:03.003
They're not the type.

01:03:04.843 --> 01:03:07.646
WON was on the suicide watch.

01:03:08.825 --> 01:03:12.160
<i>His body was frail, so was his mind.</i>

01:03:12.963 --> 01:03:15.399
<i>He was shunned by
those came after him.</i>

01:03:15.878 --> 01:03:17.245
<i>How tragic was that?</i>

01:03:17.847 --> 01:03:19.682
Pitiful bastard.

01:03:23.725 --> 01:03:24.725
I can't do it...

01:03:24.891 --> 01:03:25.700
Halt!

01:03:25.804 --> 01:03:26.804
Of course you can.

01:03:27.328 --> 01:03:28.395
Get up.

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:31.166
- 2nd platoon!
- Yes, sir!

01:03:31.167 --> 01:03:32.364
- You can do this.
- March forward!

01:03:32.388 --> 01:03:34.104
<i>And look at Lt. PARK,</i>

01:03:34.537 --> 01:03:38.020
<i>he was the first orphan to
graduate from the academy,</i>

01:03:38.044 --> 01:03:40.513
<i>and led a tough life.</i>

01:03:41.048 --> 01:03:45.521
He invited me to his home one time.

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:48.124
He got a commendation because
of me, or something.

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.259
Sgt KIM Su-hong!

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.786
Su-hong, we're having a baby.

01:03:55.112 --> 01:03:57.047
Baby!

01:03:57.282 --> 01:03:59.685
<i>Barely making ends meet,
a baby on the way,</i>

01:04:00.344 --> 01:04:03.347
<i>promotion to captain in a month...</i>

01:04:08.155 --> 01:04:10.390
<i>I bet you,</i>

01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:15.999
<i>both of them thought a lot
right after the accident.</i>

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.439
It was a bad situation all around.

01:04:21.809 --> 01:04:23.009
Snap out of it, WON Dong-yeon!

01:04:23.478 --> 01:04:25.413
He'll understand!

01:04:26.498 --> 01:04:27.498
Let's bury him!

01:04:27.584 --> 01:04:31.122
<i>If they knew I was alive,</i>

01:04:32.191 --> 01:04:34.593
they wouldn't have
buried me like that.

01:04:36.097 --> 01:04:39.167
They're not the type who'd betray me.

01:04:39.902 --> 01:04:43.240
Betraying isn't something so simple.

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:54.123
My son,

01:04:54.724 --> 01:05:01.500
tomorrow's battle will seal the
fate of the Jurchens in this area.

01:05:01.968 --> 01:05:03.002
Yes, father.

01:05:03.437 --> 01:05:08.310
We'll enter the battle together,
but you'll be the vanguard.

01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:10.180
Father, but Gang-lim should.

01:05:11.182 --> 01:05:14.686
If he leads the vanguard,
we'll win the battle,

01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:17.591
but we'll suffer
devastating casualties,

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:25.770
I can't accept that when
the victory is certain.

01:05:25.771 --> 01:05:29.442
But father, I can't replace
him on the battlefield.

01:05:29.443 --> 01:05:32.913
Son, those who weigh
lives of men differently

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:36.619
cannot become a great warrior.

01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:47.335
<i>So your father betrayed you?</i>

01:05:47.536 --> 01:05:49.772
A father betrayed his son.

01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:54.379
Even if he doesn't
trust his own child,

01:05:54.713 --> 01:05:56.916
How could he side
with a foster child?

01:05:57.317 --> 01:06:04.828
Gang-lim, he must've
really messed you up.

01:06:17.047 --> 01:06:20.284
BETRAYAL HELL

01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:28.385
What's amazing is that,
to catch the barbarians

01:06:28.731 --> 01:06:30.691
he brought his barbarian
foster son to the battle.

01:06:31.134 --> 01:06:33.203
Using their own to conquer the enemy.

01:06:33.371 --> 01:06:37.476
Father took my brother
to the fiercest battle

01:06:38.011 --> 01:06:41.515
against the Jurchens instead of me.

01:06:42.985 --> 01:06:45.278
<i>That was the last
time I saw my father.</i>

01:06:45.303 --> 01:06:46.489
GONGHEOMJIN FRONTLINE

01:06:46.657 --> 01:06:50.762
<i>50,000 of my men perished
on that battlefield...</i>

01:06:51.798 --> 01:06:54.635
<i>And I lost my father.</i>

01:07:05.085 --> 01:07:09.691
<i>The royal court appointed
me as the commander</i>

01:07:10.274 --> 01:07:12.877
<i>to win back the fortress.</i>

01:07:17.336 --> 01:07:18.370
<i>Gang-lim,</i>

01:07:18.604 --> 01:07:23.076
should I guess your first
order as the commander?

01:07:24.711 --> 01:07:27.748
<i>As the one responsible
for the father's death,</i>

01:07:28.073 --> 01:07:32.946
<i>you dispatched your brother
to the most dangerous area!</i>

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:34.918
Should we bet?

01:07:36.169 --> 01:07:41.309
I'll bet what you seek,
my reincarnation.

01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:56.838
Me? Be a guardian?

01:07:56.863 --> 01:07:59.698
Salvaging junk won't
solve your debt problem!

01:08:00.092 --> 01:08:01.426
It's $300,000!

01:08:05.298 --> 01:08:07.033
The mutual funds will definitely recover.

01:08:08.775 --> 01:08:11.278
So instead of adoption,
let's find another option.

01:08:11.405 --> 01:08:15.127
Find what? Why look for
an oasis in the desert?

01:08:15.263 --> 01:08:17.566
You gotta look for a way
out of the desert!

01:08:17.898 --> 01:08:21.069
Aside from foreign adoption,
there's no real option!

01:08:24.118 --> 01:08:27.788
Miss, am I getting adopted?

01:08:29.577 --> 01:08:31.845
ADOPTION

01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:36.032
Can you tell me a story again?

01:08:37.475 --> 01:08:40.345
♪ Life goes around! ♪

01:08:41.361 --> 01:08:44.999
So why get into stocks
without knowing anything?!

01:08:45.066 --> 01:08:46.734
You know nothing
about the stock market!

01:08:46.736 --> 01:08:51.375
How is sending him away
the best option?!

01:08:51.376 --> 01:08:53.211
Best option isn't an option here!

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.948
You gotta pick the lesser evil!

01:08:56.171 --> 01:08:58.040
- Go to the court tomorrow,
- Excuse me! Sung-ju!

01:08:58.064 --> 01:08:59.365
and be his legal guardian!

01:08:59.709 --> 01:09:00.743
What?!

01:09:01.247 --> 01:09:02.848
What happens to me?

01:09:02.962 --> 01:09:05.564
Go home already,
take the boy too!

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:11.136
No, my past life!
Did I ever go back south?

01:09:23.261 --> 01:09:25.296
She was spotted during our patrol.

01:09:26.867 --> 01:09:31.707
I told you to never
come back south.

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:35.763
- I spared you because...
- I'm so sorry...

01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:38.211
A child...

01:09:40.335 --> 01:09:41.903
a child is sick...

01:09:42.997 --> 01:09:44.395
I need herbs...

01:09:45.825 --> 01:09:47.426
I have to find herbs...

01:10:46.661 --> 01:10:47.996
Getting any better?

01:10:49.868 --> 01:10:53.772
Yes, her fever is down
and she sleeps well.

01:10:56.374 --> 01:10:58.403
I was asking about you.

01:11:03.355 --> 01:11:06.952
<i>Deok-choon who looked after
the Jurchen orphans,</i>

01:11:08.679 --> 01:11:12.851
<i>and lonely warrior Hewonmak.</i>

01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:18.827
The beautiful story of
Haewonmak and Deok-choon,

01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:21.788
this is where the story ends.

01:11:23.826 --> 01:11:26.496
Thank you for listening, Hewonmak.

01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:28.534
LEE Deok-choon.

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:29.877
And!

01:11:30.168 --> 01:11:31.336
HUR Hyun-dong!

01:11:31.439 --> 01:11:34.140
I thank you for listening,

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:36.640
cue anthem, roll credits,
let's go to bed.

01:11:36.894 --> 01:11:37.530
Bed time!

01:11:38.446 --> 01:11:39.580
Wait a minute!

01:11:41.762 --> 01:11:43.797
I think you left out
a lot of the story.

01:11:43.844 --> 01:11:45.312
I want to hear it all, sir.

01:11:45.992 --> 01:11:47.727
The story has an ending
but not a beginning.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.293
Why was I sent to the border?

01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:52.337
That's where my story starts.

01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:56.026
Recent wars are incomparable
to what happened to you.

01:11:57.653 --> 01:11:58.753
Let's drop it.

01:11:58.999 --> 01:12:00.934
Who sent me?

01:12:01.592 --> 01:12:03.193
On a border defense mission?

01:12:04.062 --> 01:12:05.096
Who was it?

01:12:07.718 --> 01:12:08.752
Answer me.

01:12:13.309 --> 01:12:16.012
<i>Milgnag...</i>

01:12:16.848 --> 01:12:17.882
Milgnag?

01:12:19.152 --> 01:12:22.656
A man named Milgnag sent you?

01:12:24.225 --> 01:12:25.793
He's my superior.

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:30.523
He sent me to defend
our northern border.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:37.344
Were your parents soldiers?

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.716
They were ordinary farmers.

01:12:42.564 --> 01:12:44.566
Separated during the war?

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:50.764
No, they both died.

01:12:53.314 --> 01:13:00.390
To a terrifying exiled warrior
called White Wildcat.

01:13:01.893 --> 01:13:05.764
<i>Always covering his
face with white fur,</i>

01:13:06.276 --> 01:13:09.780
<i>he killed every Jurchens
in sight without mercy.</i>

01:13:11.396 --> 01:13:13.898
<i>Peasants or soldiers.</i>

01:13:15.736 --> 01:13:17.238
Without mercy...

01:13:21.277 --> 01:13:23.713
<i>When White Wildcat came to my village,</i>

01:13:24.604 --> 01:13:27.196
<i>he killed my parents...</i>

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.936
Do you think he had a good reason?

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:36.104
To want to kill Jurchens like that?

01:13:48.752 --> 01:13:52.123
Humans in the living world,
and the souls in the Afterlife,

01:13:53.504 --> 01:13:55.038
they must be wise to a limit,

01:13:55.739 --> 01:13:57.841
and react only to the given situation,

01:13:58.776 --> 01:14:00.678
but if you keep asking
about the truth...

01:14:20.553 --> 01:14:22.388
At last, this is Injustice Hell.

01:14:23.469 --> 01:14:24.469
During this trial,

01:14:24.906 --> 01:14:29.678
I'll spotlight the truth behind
your wrongful death.

01:14:31.026 --> 01:14:32.615
Screw that.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:38.357
Spotlight on your story
after your father's death,

01:14:38.491 --> 01:14:42.162
and why you suffered death
in the hands of your brother.

01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:49.139
I'll tell you why you're a paragon,

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:52.922
and why your death was unjustified.

01:14:54.058 --> 01:14:57.495
You didn't die in an accident,
it was a premeditated murder.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.559
By the brothers-in-arms
you trusted the most.

01:15:11.326 --> 01:15:14.738
You write so well now. Oh my...

01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:18.193
What's wrong, grandpa?

01:15:18.349 --> 01:15:20.385
Don't say it's time to die again.

01:15:21.722 --> 01:15:23.257
No way, my boy.

01:15:24.393 --> 01:15:27.496
Aren't you starting school next week?

01:15:27.497 --> 01:15:28.531
Yup!

01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:32.438
Keep studying.

01:15:55.272 --> 01:15:58.242
You're going to the bank?

01:15:59.945 --> 01:16:02.715
Yes, sir, I'll be back.

01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:09.592
Sung-ju.

01:16:12.774 --> 01:16:13.941
Yes?

01:16:14.599 --> 01:16:18.103
Will the mutual funds recover?

01:16:19.985 --> 01:16:23.156
Sure, you've waited so long.

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:28.554
Those have to go up.

01:16:36.834 --> 01:16:37.834
Hey!

01:16:39.581 --> 01:16:41.400
Assistant guardian, LEE Deok-choon.

01:16:42.642 --> 01:16:43.642
Can we talk?

01:16:51.756 --> 01:16:52.823
Hey!

01:16:54.994 --> 01:16:58.231
Are you a Jurchen or
an assistant guardian?

01:16:58.866 --> 01:17:01.937
Keep in mind, I'm your savior, kiddo!

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.108
How could I call my parents' murderer

01:17:07.946 --> 01:17:09.348
my savior?

01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:10.765
It was a thousand years ago!

01:17:11.318 --> 01:17:14.121
You never begged for
forgiveness while I was alive!

01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:16.658
Afterlife Law, Article 1.3,
those who aren't forgiv...

01:17:16.659 --> 01:17:18.027
Hey! Stop it!

01:17:19.464 --> 01:17:20.497
Come here.

01:17:24.004 --> 01:17:26.273
You really want to know
how it really ends?

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.914
You brought it upon yourself.

01:17:33.785 --> 01:17:35.219
We're going to the court,

01:17:36.878 --> 01:17:38.132
but why are we going there for?

01:17:38.559 --> 01:17:39.799
To make you the boy's guardian.

01:17:42.097 --> 01:17:46.302
The real guardian was you
from a millennium ago.

01:18:02.394 --> 01:18:04.056
Got one!

01:18:10.506 --> 01:18:12.908
<i>Hewonmak, you tortured yourself</i>

01:18:13.304 --> 01:18:15.511
<i>with the guilt of killing her parents.</i>

01:18:20.955 --> 01:18:24.771
<i>It wasn't that you didn't
want to ask for forgiveness,</i>

01:18:25.528 --> 01:18:27.898
<i>you didn't have the courage to do so.</i>

01:18:30.736 --> 01:18:35.242
Next case is 2017-256,
Mr. HUR Sung-ju.

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:36.878
Come forward.

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:42.920
You've requested to become
HUR Hyun-dong's legal guardian.

01:18:43.655 --> 01:18:46.993
Are you HUR Sung-ju?

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.041
Hold your breath...

01:18:58.511 --> 01:18:59.511
Now.

01:19:06.589 --> 01:19:09.726
<i>You knew you couldn't
stay with them forever,</i>

01:19:09.994 --> 01:19:14.867
<i>so you taught them how
to survive on their own.</i>

01:19:15.758 --> 01:19:19.863
I hereby approve Mr. HUR
Sung-ju's request.

01:19:25.651 --> 01:19:32.193
<i>The only thing you could do was
to become the children's guardian.</i>

01:19:37.569 --> 01:19:39.938
You were a guardian angel
to the Jurchen children,

01:19:39.939 --> 01:19:42.108
but you failed to serve your country.

01:19:42.843 --> 01:19:45.480
You paid less attention
to the border patrol.

01:19:48.518 --> 01:19:53.778
<i>Extended war and severe cold
costed you lives of your men.</i>

01:19:54.995 --> 01:19:56.724
<i>You also became tired,</i>

01:19:58.433 --> 01:20:01.437
<i>but you couldn't stop
helping the children.</i>

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:07.980
<i>You spared what little ration
you had to the children,</i>

01:20:09.082 --> 01:20:13.855
<i>and you continued to write
fake reports to Milgnag.</i>

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:20.721
<i>You were a guardian
angel to the children,</i>

01:20:21.968 --> 01:20:25.541
<i>but a traitor to your country.</i>

01:20:28.455 --> 01:20:31.694
Does Injustice Hell that punish
unjust souls still exist?

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:34.274
Due to overflow of criminals,
it's currently inactive,

01:20:34.498 --> 01:20:37.835
but it'll sometimes punish
souls with vicious pasts.

01:20:38.271 --> 01:20:41.798
Do they still freeze offenders
for several decades?

01:20:42.866 --> 01:20:45.068
<i>It's a horrendous hell.</i>

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:58.421
INJUSTICE HELL

01:21:05.065 --> 01:21:06.992
GOD OF INJUSTICE

01:21:07.017 --> 01:21:08.990
It's been a while, Gang-lim.

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.194
Let's begin.

01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:15.036
Defendant KIM Su-hong

01:21:15.514 --> 01:21:19.619
has not accepted his accidental death,

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:22.357
and became a vengeful spirit,

01:21:22.427 --> 01:21:25.164
and caused havoc in the
living world and here!

01:21:25.835 --> 01:21:29.440
The prosecution requests a sentence of

01:21:30.154 --> 01:21:34.192
500 years frozen solid in ice.

01:21:34.943 --> 01:21:35.943
500 years?

01:21:37.413 --> 01:21:38.648
You idiot...

01:21:39.918 --> 01:21:42.405
KIM was wrongfully murdered.

01:21:43.801 --> 01:21:46.568
If his death was why he
became a vengeful spirit,

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:50.914
then his charge at this court
is also undeserved.

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.030
Got any evidence?

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:54.645
Bring up the Mirror of Karma.

01:21:54.670 --> 01:21:59.458
Upon his transformation,
all his records and registry

01:21:59.868 --> 01:22:02.382
have been erased as per protocol.

01:22:02.852 --> 01:22:04.821
What to do...

01:22:05.192 --> 01:22:08.610
How will you prove your claim?

01:22:09.297 --> 01:22:14.204
I request summoning of the one
responsible for his death.

01:22:16.357 --> 01:22:18.225
Summon a witness from the living world?

01:22:19.013 --> 01:22:20.206
Who might that be?

01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:29.836
An English-speaking country
would be ideal for the boy,

01:22:30.533 --> 01:22:33.160
but so long as it's not North Korea.

01:22:36.592 --> 01:22:39.361
Right, anywhere would be
better than this country.

01:22:40.678 --> 01:22:42.985
If you live honestly
with a moral code,

01:22:43.324 --> 01:22:45.459
you end up living on the streets.

01:22:47.313 --> 01:22:49.090
Hell would be more accommodating.

01:22:49.238 --> 01:22:52.204
"Stay hungry, stay foolish,"

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:54.694
Michael Jobs is an idiot.

01:22:55.029 --> 01:22:58.600
It's Steve, Steve Jobs.

01:23:01.505 --> 01:23:05.519
If you're hungry and foolish,
you're a beggar, so stupid.

01:23:06.513 --> 01:23:09.447
You can't trust those
who already live well!

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.989
They say these crap to
protect what they have.

01:23:14.169 --> 01:23:18.923
Now do you understand why
I convinced the old man

01:23:19.433 --> 01:23:22.336
to invest under the boy's name?

01:23:22.773 --> 01:23:25.643
Yes, I really hope the stocks recover.

01:23:25.958 --> 01:23:28.097
- And they have to.
- Yes, of course.

01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:35.887
Look, it's him!

01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:37.635
Hurry! Drive!

01:23:38.006 --> 01:23:39.006
Go! Go!

01:23:42.116 --> 01:23:45.236
Step on it!

01:23:47.611 --> 01:23:48.645
The demolition crew!

01:23:54.678 --> 01:23:56.546
Grandpa!

01:23:57.471 --> 01:23:58.947
Get up!

01:23:59.185 --> 01:24:00.860
Please!

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.943
Uncle, uncle!

01:24:04.398 --> 01:24:07.802
- Grandpa!
- Sir?

01:24:11.636 --> 01:24:14.938
Uncle! Hurry!

01:24:31.311 --> 01:24:32.875
Sung-ju! What's wrong?

01:24:33.687 --> 01:24:36.383
- The pot...
- Your pot?

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.735
Stick to your time.

01:25:31.563 --> 01:25:32.473
Dong-yeon!

01:25:35.306 --> 01:25:36.340
WON Dong-yeon!

01:25:41.847 --> 01:25:42.881
Sgt. KIM?

01:25:43.218 --> 01:25:45.587
Yeah, bud, how are you?

01:25:49.314 --> 01:25:50.515
Is this a dream?

01:25:50.584 --> 01:25:51.618
Yeah.

01:25:52.121 --> 01:25:53.355
I get to see you in a dream.

01:25:53.822 --> 01:25:54.889
Pvt. WON,

01:25:57.461 --> 01:25:58.595
the person you see...

01:25:58.596 --> 01:26:04.978
♪ Something over my heart ♪

01:26:05.235 --> 01:26:10.546
♪ A watch badge... ♪

01:26:11.982 --> 01:26:15.586
The person in front of you
is Sgt. KIM Su-hong,

01:26:16.943 --> 01:26:17.746
am I correct?

01:26:17.868 --> 01:26:20.391
Yes, that's Sgt. KIM.

01:26:20.538 --> 01:26:24.109
Does he have a mental disability?

01:26:24.134 --> 01:26:28.105
He was on a suicide watch,
so he needs attention,

01:26:28.106 --> 01:26:30.242
and extra protection too.

01:26:30.243 --> 01:26:33.219
He needs plenty of
unconditional reassurance too.

01:26:33.244 --> 01:26:34.382
On a suicide watch?

01:26:34.751 --> 01:26:35.751
Do you remember

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:42.561
the gunfire incident on April
30 at the sentry post?

01:26:45.098 --> 01:26:46.098
Yes.

01:26:49.547 --> 01:26:51.779
It fired by accident...

01:26:52.148 --> 01:26:54.815
That's correct, it wasn't your fault.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.163
It wasn't intentional, am I right?

01:26:58.811 --> 01:26:59.811
Yes.

01:27:01.957 --> 01:27:06.329
Good, then later that night,

01:27:06.731 --> 01:27:08.543
in the hill behind the base...

01:27:12.215 --> 01:27:16.009
You buried him alive. Am I correct?

01:27:16.043 --> 01:27:18.484
Alive? He was alive?

01:27:18.509 --> 01:27:21.578
Guardian Gang-lim, what's going on?

01:27:21.668 --> 01:27:24.447
Am I correct? Please answer, witness.

01:27:25.363 --> 01:27:26.363
No...

01:27:27.874 --> 01:27:29.112
He was already dead.

01:27:29.145 --> 01:27:32.326
Right, that's what you thought.

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:35.348
Yes.

01:27:35.715 --> 01:27:37.237
I was just following an order.

01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:39.648
No, when you were burying Sgt. KIM,

01:27:39.673 --> 01:27:42.639
<i>you knew he was still alive.</i>

01:27:44.279 --> 01:27:46.221
<i>That's why the two of you</i>

01:27:46.222 --> 01:27:48.324
<i>stopped and stared at Sgt.
KIM's twitching hand</i>

01:27:48.392 --> 01:27:50.429
<i>for a long time.</i>

01:27:51.196 --> 01:27:52.230
Am I wrong?

01:27:54.581 --> 01:27:58.227
Gang-lim, what's going on?

01:27:58.252 --> 01:28:00.910
Gang-lim is insisting
on the witness' perjury.

01:28:01.011 --> 01:28:03.565
His mental stability is in jeopardy.

01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:06.287
Guardian, you're running out of time.

01:28:07.267 --> 01:28:08.401
This is a dream...

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.790
Why is it so vivid?

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:13.263
Yes, this is a dream.

01:28:14.276 --> 01:28:17.371
You can at least be
honest in your own dream.

01:28:18.571 --> 01:28:21.299
Just one answer, be honest.

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:25.507
Pvt. WON, when you
were burying Sgt. KIM,

01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:29.614
did you or did you not
see his fingers twitch?

01:28:29.687 --> 01:28:32.125
Hey, Dong-yeon! WON Dong-yeon!

01:28:34.357 --> 01:28:38.375
Tell him you didn't see
it, he's wrong, right?

01:28:38.401 --> 01:28:39.401
<i>Say you didn't see it!</i>

01:28:49.817 --> 01:28:51.645
Never waste...

01:28:52.177 --> 01:28:58.852
new tears on the past...

01:29:00.422 --> 01:29:03.643
Bud, why did you say that?

01:29:03.759 --> 01:29:09.067
Why mention that... here?

01:29:11.728 --> 01:29:12.495
Hey, come here.

01:29:12.618 --> 01:29:13.618
KIM! Stop!

01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:34.726
What's wrong?

01:29:34.751 --> 01:29:37.661
What the hell are you saying?

01:29:37.686 --> 01:29:41.824
You knew I was alive?
Of course not, say so!

01:29:41.849 --> 01:29:43.800
What's wrong with you?

01:29:43.833 --> 01:29:46.679
That crazy bastard is
saying you killed me!

01:29:46.737 --> 01:29:48.197
Sergeant, I'm sorry...

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:55.719
<i>Sorry for what!</i>

01:29:55.775 --> 01:29:57.581
Tell me he's wrong!

01:29:57.606 --> 01:30:00.753
Sleep paralysis is
inevitable, Your Majesty!

01:30:02.545 --> 01:30:05.784
Please wake the witness!
He's in danger!

01:30:05.809 --> 01:30:07.670
Dong-yeon! Snap out of it!

01:30:07.695 --> 01:30:09.994
That's his fate.

01:30:14.216 --> 01:30:15.875
Sgt. KIM...

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.693
forgive me...

01:30:42.449 --> 01:30:45.664
<i>A murder of the witness has been...</i>

01:30:45.689 --> 01:30:50.407
added to his list of charges.

01:31:11.244 --> 01:31:15.235
How is she so naive?

01:31:16.667 --> 01:31:20.535
How could you put your
true form with other pots?

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:24.075
The best hiding spot
is in plain sight.

01:31:24.982 --> 01:31:27.521
Important evidence is
put by the trash bin.

01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:32.199
Take care of the boy.

01:31:33.037 --> 01:31:35.161
Teach him to write well.

01:31:37.499 --> 01:31:41.838
You won't get eliminated today,

01:31:41.839 --> 01:31:43.807
so don't say stuff like that.

01:31:44.477 --> 01:31:47.438
Why should you worry?
The mutual funds...

01:31:47.463 --> 01:31:50.630
Those will never recover.

01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:54.568
Do you understand? They never will.

01:31:56.528 --> 01:31:58.162
They're as good as trash.

01:31:58.631 --> 01:32:00.566
To elaborate,

01:32:01.001 --> 01:32:04.672
Korean Won has reached the
point where it'll not recover.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:08.611
Stock brokers got a whiff of it
and are dumping it en masse.

01:32:08.612 --> 01:32:09.612
Dumping?

01:32:10.147 --> 01:32:11.147
That's why.

01:32:12.618 --> 01:32:13.618
I'm sorry.

01:32:15.823 --> 01:32:16.823
I really am.

01:32:17.869 --> 01:32:21.374
Like you said, I should've
bought an apartment.

01:32:26.761 --> 01:32:29.130
Or bought some Bitcoins.

01:32:40.225 --> 01:32:41.225
Your Majesty!

01:32:41.294 --> 01:32:44.598
When in doubt, I was taught
to carry out the punishment,

01:32:44.599 --> 01:32:48.103
and reconsider it down the line.

01:32:48.104 --> 01:32:50.773
I recommend freezing him.

01:32:52.844 --> 01:32:56.248
Does he feel catharsis
during moments like this?

01:32:56.249 --> 01:32:59.186
A man is dead, what a pervert.

01:32:59.187 --> 01:33:02.691
I was taught that all
deaths must be inevitable,

01:33:02.692 --> 01:33:05.529
and none should be
wrongful in any way.

01:33:07.131 --> 01:33:08.733
His crimes have not been proven.

01:33:09.335 --> 01:33:11.905
Please give this soul
the benefit of doubt,

01:33:11.906 --> 01:33:13.026
he could still be a paragon.

01:33:17.314 --> 01:33:20.351
Gang-lim is right.

01:33:21.053 --> 01:33:22.120
He really is.

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:25.325
With the witness dead during trial,

01:33:25.549 --> 01:33:27.918
evidence could not be obtained,

01:33:28.397 --> 01:33:29.998
so continue this at his next trial.

01:33:31.202 --> 01:33:32.202
Release him!

01:33:47.125 --> 01:33:49.628
You killed Dong-yeon...

01:34:13.509 --> 01:34:14.910
Damn bastards...

01:34:15.022 --> 01:34:17.625
One time we were away from home...

01:34:19.563 --> 01:34:23.134
Things like this happen
when you least expect.

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.964
That particular day came
unexpectedly like today.

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:30.622
A millennium ago...

01:34:31.524 --> 01:34:33.158
The arrival of your superior,

01:34:34.628 --> 01:34:35.962
Milgnag.

01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:52.187
<i>Milgnag found out about
how you siphoned the ration,</i>

01:34:52.188 --> 01:34:57.261
<i>and brought his royal guards
to slaughter your men.</i>

01:35:09.013 --> 01:35:14.587
The ration you gave to our foes
ls like our people's blood.

01:35:15.355 --> 01:35:20.662
We'll break every bone in
your body as punishment.

01:35:22.766 --> 01:35:25.770
Break my bones and burn my skin,

01:35:27.206 --> 01:35:31.612
I will not tell you where
the barbarians are hiding.

01:35:40.559 --> 01:35:42.061
I'm sorry, captain...

01:35:42.396 --> 01:35:46.668
As soon as the day breaks,
we'll attack the hideout.

01:35:47.169 --> 01:35:51.107
Hewonmak is an enemy of the state,

01:35:51.175 --> 01:35:55.380
Tie him and his man up and
feed them to the wolves!

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:58.819
Milgnag is bad!

01:35:59.321 --> 01:36:00.922
He's so bad!

01:36:02.726 --> 01:36:03.640
MILGNAG

01:36:03.665 --> 01:36:04.665
So...

01:36:07.466 --> 01:36:09.268
was I fed to the wolves?

01:36:20.085 --> 01:36:26.702
It's been a privilege serving
a warrior like you...

01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:29.999
Beard, stay alert.

01:36:32.069 --> 01:36:33.838
You have to stay awake.

01:36:35.975 --> 01:36:38.444
Beard! Beard!

01:36:56.239 --> 01:36:59.142
VIOLENCE HELL

01:37:00.645 --> 01:37:01.646
Your Majesty!

01:37:01.647 --> 01:37:04.683
We've suffered an unexpected death

01:37:04.684 --> 01:37:07.187
of a witness in the previous trial

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:09.958
thanks to Gang-lim's
intolerable questioning.

01:37:09.959 --> 01:37:11.033
GOD OF VIOLENCE

01:37:11.303 --> 01:37:14.020
If he continues to...

01:37:14.045 --> 01:37:14.666
Your Majesty!

01:37:20.898 --> 01:37:23.712
Please withhold the ruling
until the Murder Hell trial.

01:37:24.681 --> 01:37:25.748
Withhold?

01:37:26.817 --> 01:37:29.654
Do you know what that means?

01:37:30.122 --> 01:37:34.094
If I do not prove the
defendant's wrongful death,

01:37:34.796 --> 01:37:38.133
I will lose my guardianship.

01:37:38.134 --> 01:37:39.502
No, Your Majesty!

01:37:39.503 --> 01:37:41.772
He mustn't be allowed to deceive...

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:44.710
I'll forfeit reincarnation!

01:37:44.711 --> 01:37:46.512
What a load of crap!

01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:51.277
Reincarnation is least of his worries.

01:37:51.688 --> 01:37:54.691
I'm referring to my own reincarnation.

01:37:55.775 --> 01:38:00.800
You'll give up all the work
you've done over a millennium?

01:38:01.212 --> 01:38:02.036
Yes.

01:38:05.976 --> 01:38:06.976
Your condition?

01:38:08.246 --> 01:38:13.619
Summon Lt. PARK Mu-sin as the
Murder Hell trial witness.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:15.789
In addition,

01:38:16.925 --> 01:38:19.995
please summon King Yeomra,

01:38:20.931 --> 01:38:26.071
he will be KIM's
trial's final witness!

01:38:42.095 --> 01:38:43.096
Beard...

01:38:46.692 --> 01:38:47.692
Hey...

01:40:02.692 --> 01:40:04.861
Listen carefully to what I tell you.

01:40:05.253 --> 01:40:10.418
<i>After walking through the
snow for almost 8 km,</i>

01:40:11.028 --> 01:40:15.005
<i>you got the children to flee,</i>

01:40:15.034 --> 01:40:16.035
<i>Hurry!</i>

01:40:16.036 --> 01:40:19.607
<i>and stayed back to them more time.</i>

01:40:26.518 --> 01:40:30.022
<i>I'll catch up with you! Go now!</i>

01:40:46.574 --> 01:40:47.574
What...

01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:49.690
do we do now?

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:55.617
Leave at once.

01:41:00.068 --> 01:41:01.068
I can't...

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.162
I won't leave.

01:41:06.811 --> 01:41:08.145
Get going.

01:41:10.583 --> 01:41:12.852
Go and protect the children.

01:41:14.556 --> 01:41:15.556
Please...

01:41:19.407 --> 01:41:20.641
Now!

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:30.167
Wait...

01:41:59.422 --> 01:42:00.523
I'm sorry...

01:42:07.768 --> 01:42:08.769
I'm so sorry...

01:42:46.125 --> 01:42:47.449
That's how...

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.289
you begged for forgiveness.

01:43:32.794 --> 01:43:33.995
<i>So that was the day...</i>

01:43:37.279 --> 01:43:38.447
Milgnag...

01:43:40.228 --> 01:43:41.395
killed me?

01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:45.045
Do you resent him?

01:43:49.063 --> 01:43:50.430
While in the living world,

01:43:52.167 --> 01:43:57.441
I served many households
and observed people,

01:43:59.368 --> 01:44:01.370
and I still don't get humans.

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:05.509
But one thing's for sure.

01:44:09.916 --> 01:44:11.751
No humans are innately bad,

01:44:13.188 --> 01:44:14.956
only bad circumstances.

01:44:17.227 --> 01:44:20.998
So when you feel resentful,

01:44:20.999 --> 01:44:24.270
angry and can't understand,

01:44:25.139 --> 01:44:29.110
try to read and think
everything backwards.

01:44:31.838 --> 01:44:33.339
It'll make sense then.

01:44:35.142 --> 01:44:36.644
These people,

01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:40.661
this world,

01:44:42.898 --> 01:44:44.032
and the space...

01:44:49.508 --> 01:44:52.078
So did Milgnag kill me?

01:44:54.816 --> 01:44:55.816
Huh?

01:45:08.670 --> 01:45:10.505
HUR CHOON-SAM

01:45:38.681 --> 01:45:40.583
Stay alert, KIM Su-hong.

01:45:58.110 --> 01:45:59.111
Should I...

01:46:01.148 --> 01:46:02.282
ascend him?

01:46:06.067 --> 01:46:10.740
Should I do it?

01:46:15.269 --> 01:46:16.800
HUR Choon-sam!

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.558
- No! Please!
- HUR Choon-sam!

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:22.444
No, Hewonmak! Please don't!

01:46:22.469 --> 01:46:23.113
HUR!

01:46:34.163 --> 01:46:36.699
Where's my uncle?

01:46:38.036 --> 01:46:40.239
Where is he?

01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:48.250
Uncle! Uncle!

01:46:48.251 --> 01:46:49.419
No! Hyun-dong! No!

01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:50.420
HUR Hyun-dong!

01:46:50.421 --> 01:46:52.757
Uncle Sung-ju!

01:46:53.392 --> 01:46:57.831
Uncle! Where are you?!

01:47:11.686 --> 01:47:13.354
<i>Milgnag is bad!</i>

01:47:13.355 --> 01:47:14.188
<i>He's so bad!</i>

01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:16.392
<i>Milgnag killed me?</i>

01:47:16.393 --> 01:47:18.228
Do you resent him?

01:47:38.726 --> 01:47:40.795
Why are you so hell-bent on this?

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.238
Yeomra has nothing
to do with my trial.

01:47:48.774 --> 01:47:52.712
Why are you using me, asshole!

01:47:56.953 --> 01:48:00.457
<i>So when you feel resentful,</i>

01:48:00.458 --> 01:48:02.427
<i>angry and can't understand,</i>

01:48:02.428 --> 01:48:06.466
try to read and think
everything backwards.

01:48:08.370 --> 01:48:10.005
<i>It'll make sense then.</i>

01:48:11.742 --> 01:48:13.243
<i>These people,</i>

01:48:14.479 --> 01:48:15.650
<i>this world,</i>

01:48:17.529 --> 01:48:18.753
<i>and the space...</i>

01:48:26.214 --> 01:48:28.383
<i>You're trying to erase</i>

01:48:28.408 --> 01:48:31.445
your memory and get
reincarnated by using me.

01:48:31.936 --> 01:48:32.936
Am I right?

01:48:37.112 --> 01:48:39.891
It was your reincarnation
that you cared about.

01:48:40.451 --> 01:48:41.452
Shut up.

01:48:44.445 --> 01:48:45.445
I'm right.

01:48:45.993 --> 01:48:48.896
So what's the memory you're
so desperate to erase?

01:48:50.666 --> 01:48:52.802
What's the memory?

01:48:53.504 --> 01:48:55.014
<i>You can tell me.</i>

01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:21.077
What was the memory of
your wrongful death?

01:49:24.717 --> 01:49:26.318
GANGLIM

01:49:41.242 --> 01:49:43.577
Stop ignoring me,

01:49:43.578 --> 01:49:45.914
and speak your mind, you asshole!

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:01.070
<i>What strategy is this? A barbaric tactic?</i>

01:50:01.071 --> 01:50:03.807
<i>Reading my opponent...</i>

01:50:03.808 --> 01:50:05.310
<i>are the virtues of a general...</i>

01:50:07.881 --> 01:50:10.384
<i>Those who weigh lives
of men differently</i>

01:50:10.385 --> 01:50:12.754
<i>cannot become great warrior.</i>

01:50:12.779 --> 01:50:18.396
<i>You've been charged with
all 7 mortal sins of hell.</i>

01:50:19.231 --> 01:50:24.534
<i>But I will give you one last
chance to redeem yourself.</i>

01:50:25.173 --> 01:50:26.554
<i>Will you comply?</i>

01:50:31.883 --> 01:50:34.586
Did you train our enemies
on military tactics?

01:50:35.756 --> 01:50:39.661
They were starving children...

01:50:40.896 --> 01:50:43.132
They are innocent...

01:50:52.414 --> 01:50:58.455
Your first crime is not protecting
my father from the Jurchens.

01:51:00.326 --> 01:51:02.194
You've also committed treason,

01:51:02.195 --> 01:51:05.566
by distributing precious ration

01:51:05.879 --> 01:51:08.381
and training our enemies.

01:51:08.538 --> 01:51:11.174
Let the children go...

01:51:11.442 --> 01:51:14.045
It is unnecessary violence,

01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:18.763
and a sin of murder.

01:51:21.657 --> 01:51:22.658
Brother...

01:51:33.968 --> 01:51:35.158
I never...

01:51:35.979 --> 01:51:38.448
once thought of you as my brother.

01:51:39.544 --> 01:51:41.387
A Khitan bastard!

01:53:19.177 --> 01:53:21.012
<i>Why do you cry?</i>

01:53:24.373 --> 01:53:26.441
<i>Out of sorrow?</i>

01:53:27.811 --> 01:53:29.847
<i>Or do you feel wronged?</i>

01:53:32.576 --> 01:53:33.789
<i>I'll ask again.</i>

01:53:35.494 --> 01:53:37.667
<i>Is it out of sorrow?</i>

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:41.141
<i>Or do you feel wronged?</i>

01:54:21.658 --> 01:54:22.658
Let's move.

01:54:23.301 --> 01:54:24.480
Gang-lim...

01:54:32.841 --> 01:54:33.842
What is it?

01:54:34.544 --> 01:54:35.544
Pardon?

01:54:36.346 --> 01:54:37.347
What are you doing here?

01:54:39.518 --> 01:54:42.955
Sung-ju has been eliminated.

01:54:44.992 --> 01:54:45.993
So what?

01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:54.405
I have something to ask you.

01:54:55.308 --> 01:54:59.398
With him out of the way,
what must you do?

01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:02.817
Mr. HUR...

01:55:05.356 --> 01:55:09.294
We have to bring him, right?

01:55:11.131 --> 01:55:12.132
LEE Deok-choon.

01:55:13.034 --> 01:55:15.136
What did you learn from
me over the years?

01:55:16.406 --> 01:55:18.675
What have I taught you
for a millennium?

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:24.052
A millennium...

01:55:26.175 --> 01:55:27.977
It's been a millennium...

01:55:35.813 --> 01:55:39.283
Looks like I wasn't the
subject of this trial.

01:55:40.809 --> 01:55:41.809
Let's go.

01:55:42.177 --> 01:55:43.511
To the next trial.

01:55:44.481 --> 01:55:46.717
Whether it's mine or yours,

01:55:46.718 --> 01:55:48.553
let's get it over with.

01:56:40.965 --> 01:56:44.269
MURDER HELL

01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:48.575
This is the last trial for
defendant KIM Su-hong,

01:56:48.576 --> 01:56:52.347
whom the attorney claims
to have died a wrongful death,

01:56:52.348 --> 01:56:54.117
and in the outcome...

01:56:54.118 --> 01:56:57.021
Cut the chitchat and get on with it!

01:57:10.375 --> 01:57:12.744
GOD OF MURDER

01:57:16.118 --> 01:57:17.619
Begin the trial!

01:57:19.656 --> 01:57:20.923
First of all,

01:57:20.924 --> 01:57:22.325
I'd like to ask Lt. PARK.

01:57:22.326 --> 01:57:25.630
Did you or did you not
murder the defendant

01:57:25.631 --> 01:57:29.069
even after finding out
that he was still alive?

01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:31.539
<i>In other words, did you and Pvt. WON</i>

01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:35.044
<i>see KIM Su-hong's fingers twitch?</i>

01:57:35.045 --> 01:57:37.414
Gang-lim, is that everything?

01:57:37.415 --> 01:57:39.584
Then I'll answer for him too.

01:57:39.585 --> 01:57:41.854
No, that is incorrect.

01:57:41.855 --> 01:57:44.224
Your Majesty, I beg of you

01:57:44.225 --> 01:57:48.431
not to fall for fallacious arguments
and make unjust judgment!

01:57:50.202 --> 01:57:51.536
Is the prosecutor correct?

01:57:58.279 --> 01:57:59.847
I first met Yeomra,

01:58:01.651 --> 01:58:09.262
a millennium ago as I was
dying after committing murder.

01:58:11.433 --> 01:58:16.539
You offered me guardianship, who'll
uphold laws of the Afterlife.

01:58:17.312 --> 01:58:18.479
Do you remember?

01:58:22.444 --> 01:58:24.346
Must I answer that?

01:58:24.842 --> 01:58:25.876
Yes, please answer.

01:58:26.633 --> 01:58:32.942
Tell us what you said when
you offered me the role.

01:58:35.302 --> 01:58:39.073
Your sins are grave,

01:58:39.074 --> 01:58:43.045
hence your memories
will remain intact,

01:58:43.469 --> 01:58:48.094
while erasing that
of these poor souls.

01:58:48.889 --> 01:58:56.165
If you reincarnate 49
souls in a millennium,

01:58:56.542 --> 01:58:59.646
with these 2 souls you've killed,

01:58:59.671 --> 01:59:03.798
I'll reincarnate you in
any form you desire.

01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:10.338
In addition, I'll erase
your memories then.

01:59:12.513 --> 01:59:13.781
Will you accept?

01:59:14.549 --> 01:59:20.758
Why did you force me to live
out a millennium of pain,

01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:26.042
please tell Lt. PARK directly
in the witness stand.

01:59:26.043 --> 01:59:27.177
How dare you!

01:59:29.882 --> 01:59:34.688
Paying for my sin of
killing an innocent girl,

01:59:34.689 --> 01:59:39.796
and my righteous brother,
was this the reason?

01:59:42.401 --> 01:59:45.972
I'd like to once again
ask King Yeomra,

01:59:46.807 --> 01:59:48.943
if this was the reason.

01:59:49.745 --> 01:59:52.047
I've given you time!

01:59:53.317 --> 01:59:59.659
Correct, you gave me a
millennium to pay for my sin,

01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:03.898
and beg them for forgiveness.

02:00:04.867 --> 02:00:05.868
Am I correct?

02:00:08.106 --> 02:00:12.912
So, have you begged for forgiveness?

02:00:15.283 --> 02:00:16.283
No, sir.

02:00:18.287 --> 02:00:22.125
I did not, I could not,

02:00:22.126 --> 02:00:26.799
so I live every single
day with guilt and pain

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:28.802
while having them by my side.

02:00:38.517 --> 02:00:40.419
A question for Lt. PARK!

02:00:44.226 --> 02:00:49.266
Do you remember almost dying
in the sand whirlwind?

02:00:55.852 --> 02:00:59.221
<i>Why do you think I broke
the law of the Afterlife</i>

02:00:59.246 --> 02:01:01.746
to save your life?

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.139
To prevent another victim...

02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:11.470
Shut your mouth, PARK Mu-sin!

02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:16.649
I did not save you to
spare a pitiful soul,

02:01:16.650 --> 02:01:19.919
but to atone for your sins
until the day you die,

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:23.259
I've given you time,
just like Yeomra did!

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:25.190
So you don't make the same mistake!

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.630
Gang-lim! How dare you!

02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:30.600
Open the pit!

02:01:37.410 --> 02:01:39.719
If you intimidate the
witness once more,

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:44.490
I'll toss the defendant in
without warning!

02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:53.700
This is a dream!

02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:58.480
It's a dream!

02:02:04.590 --> 02:02:07.589
Your Majesty! His time is running out!

02:02:07.590 --> 02:02:10.530
He will wake up soon!
He needs to be sent back!

02:02:20.210 --> 02:02:22.410
One last question for King Yeomra!

02:02:28.290 --> 02:02:34.760
Remember my father,
GANG Moon-jik of Goryeo,

02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:38.100
who died fighting the
Jurchens a millennium ago?

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.940
State the truth, not how
you wish to remember!

02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:48.180
He didn't die in the battle,
he was murdered!

02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:51.811
Murdered?

02:02:56.730 --> 02:03:00.769
Yes, then tell us why

02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:06.750
his death was not recorded as
murder in the history books.

02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:20.570
It was covered up.

02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:22.700
What?

02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:34.390
Right, that's correct.

02:03:39.855 --> 02:03:43.700
<i>It was covered up by someone.</i>

02:03:54.651 --> 02:03:56.302
I was that someone.

02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:13.950
<i>I knew my father was still alive.</i>

02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:19.190
Retreat at once, and
return in the morning!

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.720
Yes, sir!

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:27.899
<i>Why did you not save your father?</i>

02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:30.469
Let me rephrase that!

02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:35.080
Why did you turn back
and left him to die?!

02:04:39.875 --> 02:04:40.905
I was scared.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:46.529
Son, always remember,

02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:49.499
your strategy is not important...

02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:52.239
<i>I was afraid of losing my position</i>

02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:54.510
<i>to my righteous brother,</i>

02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:02.619
<i>I was afraid that he would take</i>

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:04.950
<i>honor and authority away from me.</i>

02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:11.600
After retreating to the barracks,

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:17.370
<i>I realized my folly and
returned to the battlefield,</i>

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:21.079
<i>but he had already passed on,</i>

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:27.782
<i>and I still live with
regrets to this day.</i>

02:05:28.327 --> 02:05:34.213
Did your life of
regret feel like hell?

02:05:35.070 --> 02:05:40.810
Did the thousand years
of regret feel like hell?

02:05:46.582 --> 02:05:51.142
The fact that I cannot
beg for his forgiveness,

02:05:52.014 --> 02:05:55.994
<i>and that I cannot be forgiven...</i>

02:05:57.421 --> 02:05:58.421
that...

02:05:59.665 --> 02:06:02.145
that has been my biggest hell.

02:06:41.584 --> 02:06:44.521
I'd like to let PARK know

02:06:44.958 --> 02:06:48.122
unlike me, he still has a chance.

02:06:52.175 --> 02:06:55.580
Were you aware

02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:58.853
that when you were burying him,

02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:04.020
<i>Sgt. KIM was still alive?</i>

02:07:08.914 --> 02:07:11.890
<i>- I'll rephrase,</i>
- #127, wake up!

02:07:11.915 --> 02:07:16.400
did you murder KIM Su-hong?

02:07:21.628 --> 02:07:22.708
Let's bury him.

02:07:23.303 --> 02:07:24.969
It's too late to bring him out.

02:07:26.095 --> 02:07:27.301
Yes...

02:07:31.691 --> 02:07:38.079
I murdered KIM Su-hong...

02:07:48.079 --> 02:07:51.741
I'm sorry, Su-hong, I'm so sorry...

02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:53.870
I'm sorry...

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:17.606
This concludes my
witness questioning.

02:08:25.890 --> 02:08:30.089
It has been proven that
defendant KIM Su-hong

02:08:30.090 --> 02:08:33.688
died an unregistered wrongful death!

02:08:35.639 --> 02:08:37.369
Therefore,

02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:40.976
I order his immediate reincarnation!

02:09:48.570 --> 02:09:49.665
Hello...

02:10:04.599 --> 02:10:06.699
Had we known he'd be adopted abroad,

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:11.110
we should've taught him
English alphabets instead.

02:10:14.707 --> 02:10:17.037
Ascend HUR and let's all reincarnate.

02:10:20.772 --> 02:10:24.472
HUR Choon-sam.

02:10:26.354 --> 02:10:30.594
HUR Choon-sam.

02:10:33.382 --> 02:10:35.810
HUR Choon...

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:39.790
Deok-choon,

02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:43.410
can you forgive captain?

02:10:45.935 --> 02:10:49.805
You said I'm not the same girl
as I was a millennium ago.

02:10:50.153 --> 02:10:52.763
Sure, you decide,
it's your business.

02:10:55.966 --> 02:10:57.146
I bet...

02:10:58.315 --> 02:10:59.833
you won't though.

02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:15.370
I don't really know.

02:11:16.306 --> 02:11:19.376
Hurry, I'll be late!

02:11:19.601 --> 02:11:22.534
- Happy, kiddo?
- Yup!

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.960
Let's ascend him when
the boy graduates.

02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:30.490
And our reincarnation?

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:39.510
The thing is, we have...

02:11:41.362 --> 02:11:42.808
we have some time left.

02:11:43.672 --> 02:11:47.872
Let's head on up, we're
assigned to a weirdo.

02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:51.220
Weirdo? Again? Who?!

02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:53.760
He's been roaming at the Gate
of Afterlife for 3 days.

02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:56.370
Fine, we reincarnate after him?

02:12:00.570 --> 02:12:04.409
Hello? Is anyone here?

02:12:04.410 --> 02:12:07.450
Stop it! That's scary!

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:12.290
Sgt. KIM!

02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:14.560
Where am I?

02:12:19.570 --> 02:12:21.340
Another paragon?

02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:24.370
It's a year of paragons.

02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:27.480
WON DONG-YEON

02:12:28.416 --> 02:12:30.120
It's scary here!

02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:33.350
Let's go.

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:35.790
I need help!

02:12:36.090 --> 02:12:37.790
Please help me!

02:12:40.730 --> 02:12:41.730
Hold on!

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:45.810
Hello?

02:12:46.410 --> 02:12:50.880
I actually have something
to confess to you two.

02:12:52.289 --> 02:12:55.607
I... when I...

02:12:58.438 --> 02:12:59.159
A millennium ago...

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.960
Anyone here?

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:02.660
At that time...

02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:08.110
I have done...

02:13:09.747 --> 02:13:10.810
I...

02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.010
Anyone?!

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:14.479
We're busy here,

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.250
why bring up a millennium-old story?

02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.630
It is indeed a year of paragons.

02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:24.833
Let's go!

02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:26.470
Sgt KIM!

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:30.340
Hey, soldier!

02:13:30.849 --> 02:13:31.909
Stop right there! Don't move!

02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:34.509
- Stay back!
- It's alright.

02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:36.009
It's your first time dying.

02:13:36.010 --> 02:13:37.780
Who are you people?

02:13:43.630 --> 02:13:44.630
Here, eat this.

02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:45.990
No!

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.599
This will help you grow.

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.170
I don't like veggies.

02:13:51.731 --> 02:13:56.563
<i>China announced expansion of
finances and infrastructure,</i>

02:13:56.607 --> 02:13:57.355
What is it?

02:13:57.424 --> 02:13:58.544
<i>which led to rise in KOSPI.</i>

02:13:58.569 --> 02:14:01.280
KOSPI? Is it a plaything?

02:14:01.290 --> 02:14:03.689
You'll find out when you grow up.

02:14:03.690 --> 02:14:06.990
What is it? I wanna know!

02:14:07.376 --> 02:14:11.228
We're saved...

02:14:11.853 --> 02:14:13.970

Pardon me.

02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:30.960
So you failed the bar 8 times?

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:38.040
I passed the first round!

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:41.210
Passing first round after 8 attempts?

02:14:41.850 --> 02:14:44.480
You have an interesting history.

02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:47.990
Like hell it is.

02:14:51.460 --> 02:14:53.430
