it certainly will make this

09:31.839 --> 09:33.906
a harder case for us to win.

09:33.908 --> 09:36.575
Before the accident, everything
was leaning in our direction.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.545
Now Noah can claim
that he's just as competent.

09:39.547 --> 09:41.013
The kids
are gonna have to talk

09:41.015 --> 09:42.381
to a court-appointed
forensic psychiatrist.

09:42.383 --> 09:44.516
I know. It sucks.

09:44.518 --> 09:45.783
[Margaret]
Leonard can do it.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.852
I'm sorry, who's Leonard?

09:47.854 --> 09:50.255
Leonard Gillette.
He's Martin's psychiatrist.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.689
He's one of the most
highly regarded

09:51.691 --> 09:53.591

in the city.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.792

09:54.794 --> 09:56.028
[groans]

09:56.030 --> 09:58.696
He knows Martin
well already.

09:58.698 --> 10:02.401
He can testify that his father
causes him great distress,

10:02.403 --> 10:03.868
has literally made him sick.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.703
But I don't want to put the kids
through that.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.406
All right,
I've got it.

10:07.408 --> 10:10.107
That stooge you were seeing,
the one who gave you the candy?

10:10.109 --> 10:11.709
- What's his name again?
- Max?

10:11.711 --> 10:13.611
We just get Max to admit

10:13.613 --> 10:15.446
he didn't tell Helen
the thing was spiked.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.881
He never told you?

10:16.883 --> 10:18.750
Of course he told her.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.251
So it's still
his fault, right?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.020
The guy's a drug addict,
isn't he?

10:22.022 --> 10:24.121
He's not a drug addict.
He runs a hedge fund.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.390
Even better,
he's got a lot to lose.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.927
We threaten to go to the cops
if he doesn't do what we want.

our daughter's married

10:34.500 --> 10:36.333

10:36.335 --> 10:38.036
Look who her father is.

The man thinks
he can buy anything:

10:39.906 --> 10:41.338
reviews, verdicts, women.

10:41.340 --> 10:42.673
I hope you don't mean Ina.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.841
Of course
I mean fucking Ina.

10:44.843 --> 10:45.842
I didn't buy her, you bitch!

Once we get in there,
we'll know more.

13:54.594 --> 13:56.527
- The symptoms started when?
- Two months ago.

13:56.529 --> 13:58.062
- Three months ago.
- No, it hasn't been that long.

13:58.064 --> 13:59.797
Yes, it's obvious
if you were paying attention.

13:59.799 --> 14:01.366
What about food?
Is he eating?

14:01.368 --> 14:02.767
- Not well.
- He's lost some weight.

14:02.769 --> 14:04.269
Uh, today.
Breakfast? Lunch?

14:04.271 --> 14:05.803
He's had two hot dogs
and some popcorn.

14:05.805 --> 14:07.472
- Two hot dogs?
- We were at a ball game.

14:07.474 --> 14:09.006

what he was eating.

I know this is hard,
but let's try to keep cool here.

should run about two hours,

there's a room available.

- Right now.

Okay, Martin, we're gonna
put you to sleep for a bit,

I'm having surgery?

Yeah, but it's gonna be fine.
I promise, honey.

definitely not Montauk.

- Hawaii?

- We'll learn to surf.

- She's a waitress.

She's a pediatric nurse

16:15.765 --> 16:17.964
to tell us something,
give us some fucking information

since no one else
will come talk to us.

in the first place,

16:21.670 --> 16:23.169
none of this
would've happened.

16:23.171 --> 16:24.638
What is that supposed to mean?

16:24.640 --> 16:25.739
She said bring him
to the hospital

16:25.741 --> 16:27.974
that first day he was bad.

16:27.976 --> 16:29.742
The day you lost your mind.

16:29.744 --> 16:31.244
I did not lose my mind!
I made a mistake!

16:31.246 --> 16:32.845
Instead you took him
to a shrink

16:32.847 --> 16:34.014
because your mother said
it was my fault...

16:34.016 --> 16:35.481
You know what,
this isn't fair.

16:35.483 --> 16:36.749
...I caused his problems,
I made him sick.

16:36.751 --> 16:38.484
This is not fair!
Noah, it is not fair.

16:38.486 --> 16:40.353
- I mean, Helen, I know...
- Are you actually blaming me?

16:40.355 --> 16:42.088
I know you're angry with me, but
the way you ate up all that crap

16:42.090 --> 16:43.756
she was spoon-feeding you
when everyone else can see...

16:43.758 --> 16:45.558
You're the one that took him
to the fucking baseball game

16:45.560 --> 16:46.927
- and just fed him all of that...
- ...she's a raving lunatic?

16:46.929 --> 16:48.061
When are you gonna learn
to think for yourself?

16:48.063 --> 16:50.930
[Ullah]
You can stop now.

16:50.932 --> 16:54.400
Martin's okay.
It went well.

16:55.637 --> 16:57.570
- Why don't you sit too?
- Yeah.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.844
So we removed a length
of Martin's bowel

17:04.846 --> 17:06.813
that was perforated
and infected.

17:06.815 --> 17:08.647
I'm guessing
it's Crohn's disease.

17:08.650 --> 17:10.983

- It's an autoimmune disease.

17:10.984 --> 17:13.952
Autoimmune, um...

17:13.954 --> 17:15.954
It's like your mom.

17:18.156 --> 17:19.790
Yeah, my mom had MS.

17:19.792 --> 17:20.858
That makes sense.

17:20.861 --> 17:22.193
The diseases are related.

17:22.194 --> 17:23.662
They can show up
in the same family.

17:23.664 --> 17:26.464
Well, he's seen his doctor
twice.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.467
Crohn's is notoriously hard
to diagnose.

17:28.469 --> 17:29.968
It can look like
all kinds of things.

17:29.970 --> 17:31.235
So what now?

17:31.237 --> 17:33.338
Martin will stay here
for ten days.

17:33.340 --> 17:34.673
You'll meet with my colleague,

17:34.675 --> 17:36.007
and she'll talk you
through everything.

17:36.009 --> 17:37.475
The long and the short
of it is,

17:37.477 --> 17:39.477
this is chronic
but treatable.

17:39.479 --> 17:41.412
Now, it's going to take
coordination,

17:41.414 --> 17:43.081
a lot of attention
from both of you,

17:43.083 --> 17:44.748

who doesn't like

17:44.750 --> 17:46.817
to take medication
and misses French fries,

17:46.819 --> 17:50.855
but if you stay on him,
work together,

17:50.857 --> 17:54.325
Martin will lead
a normal life.

17:54.327 --> 17:55.693
Mm-hmm.

17:55.695 --> 17:58.629
He'll be in room 730
in about 20 minutes.

18:00.565 --> 18:02.466
- I wish you the best of luck.
- Thank you.

18:02.468 --> 18:03.467
