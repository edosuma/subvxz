00:03.100 --> 00:06.800
HeImsman's Log,
Stardate 50252.3.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.500
WhiIe Voyager takes on suppIies,

00:08.600 --> 00:10.400
Lieutenant Torres and I
are investigating

00:10.400 --> 00:11.800
some intermittent
sensor readings

00:11.900 --> 00:13.900
we picked up this morning.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.000
We've been out here
aImost five hours

00:22.000 --> 00:24.600
and we haven't seen any sign
of those energy signatures.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.800
Isn't it time to admit
they were nothing more

00:27.900 --> 00:30.200
than gaIactic background noise?

00:30.300 --> 00:32.800
I want to keep Iooking
a whiIe Ionger.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.800
Just to be sure.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.800
Aah!

00:36.900 --> 00:38.400
What's wrong?

00:38.400 --> 00:40.100
Cramp.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.600
KIingon bodies weren't meant
to sit in a cockpit

00:42.700 --> 00:44.400
for five hours at a stretch.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.100
You have a big dinner date
or something?

00:49.500 --> 00:51.100
What's that supposed to mean?

00:51.100 --> 00:53.100
WeII, you've been angIing
to get back to Voyager

00:53.100 --> 00:55.000
for about two hours now.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.300
Just thought maybe
there was a reason.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.900
Like Ensign Bristow.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.500
What?

01:01.600 --> 01:03.300
WeII, I've noticed
he's been making any excuse

01:03.400 --> 01:04.599
to hang around Engineering.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.300
Around you.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.700
Freddy Bristow... is a chiId.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
Oh, reaIIy?

01:10.800 --> 01:13.900
WeII, he Iooks
Iike a grownup to me.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.600
TaII, good-Iooking...

01:16.600 --> 01:19.800
and I hear he pIays a mean set
of parrises squares.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.400
I pIayed one game with him
and I whipped him.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.300
Look, he has a crush on me.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.000
I can handIe it.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.100
Why are you so interested?

01:30.100 --> 01:31.900
Oh, I'm just curious...

01:32.000 --> 01:33.500
how someone with KIingon bIood

01:33.500 --> 01:36.400
seems to Iive the Iife
of a Tabran monk.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.300
Lieutenant, that is none
of your business.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.400
WeII, if you ever have
a free evening,

01:45.400 --> 01:48.100
I have a hoIodeck program
you might enjoy--

01:48.200 --> 01:50.000
saiIing on Lake Como.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.300
I'd rather take my chances
with Freddy Bristow.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.700
Those energy signatures
are back.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.300
We must have crossed
into a tachyon fieId.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.700
What's that?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.699
A ship has Iocked onto our huII.

02:09.699 --> 02:11.100
Why didn't we detect it?

02:11.100 --> 02:14.400
The tachyon fieId must have
disrupted our sensors.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.200
I'm Lieutenant Tom Paris of...

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:30.700 --> 04:35.700
O soave fanciulla

04:35.800 --> 04:39.600
O dolce viso

04:39.600 --> 04:46.400
Di mite circonfuso alba lunar

04:48.700 --> 04:54.600
ln terra, vivo ravviso

04:54.600 --> 05:04.200
ll sogno ch'io
vorrei sempre sognar

05:04.300 --> 05:12.800
Fremon gia nell'anima

05:12.900 --> 05:15.300
Le dolcezze estreme

05:15.400 --> 05:20.000
Tu sol commandi, amore

05:20.100 --> 05:22.200
Computer, pause pIayback.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.200
Excuse me, but your entrance
was earIy.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.500
You're rushing the tempo.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.600
I am not rushing.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.700
You are Iagging behind
Iike a tired donkey.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.900
I assure you, I have studied

05:32.900 --> 05:34.500
the finest recordings
of this opera--

05:34.600 --> 05:37.400
Caruso and GaIIi-Curci;
Pavarotti and Freni;

05:37.400 --> 05:40.000
SoraI and T'Penna of VuIcan.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.300
My tempo is accurate.

05:41.400 --> 05:46.600
GaIIi-Curci... Freni...
T'Penna... they are aII fallite

05:46.600 --> 05:48.200
They are mere dust baIIs.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.400
Sono niente!

05:49.500 --> 05:51.400
They are nothing.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.500
Giuseppina PentangeIi--
the greatest soprano lirico

05:54.600 --> 05:58.300
of the 22nd century
transcends them aII.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.400
And conductors
take their tempi from me.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.800
Capisci?

06:02.800 --> 06:06.500
In this instance,
they take it from me.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.800
I've programmed
the orchestraI pIayback.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.200
Who aIIows you
to make this choice?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.900
You are an amateur.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.100
You have no sense of rubato,

06:15.100 --> 06:20.000
no rallentando it's Iike
singing with a computer.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.500
Madam, I may be an amateur,

06:23.500 --> 06:25.200
but I'm aIso known
as a quick study.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.000
And as I am
in charge of this program,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
you wiII do it my way.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.800
ShaII we try it again?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.700
Computer, start pIayback.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.200
O soave fanciulla

06:43.300 --> 06:44.300
O

06:45.300 --> 06:46.400
Stop pIayback.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
What now?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.400
Non ? possibile

06:50.500 --> 06:52.800
I couIdn't remember the words.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.900
In aII of my career, I have
never forgotten the Iyrics.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.500
This is the difference

06:56.500 --> 06:58.700
between amateur
and professionali

06:58.800 --> 07:01.100
Just a momentary Iapse.
No need to overreact.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.200
Piu cretino non esiste

07:03.300 --> 07:05.000
This is infuriating!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I want another partner!

07:07.000 --> 07:08.200
Lo voglio subito

07:08.200 --> 07:10.300
I'm the one who needs
another partner.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.400
You've got me so upset
I can't sing.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
Computer, deIete...

07:13.400 --> 07:14.500
Janeway to the Doctor.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.900
We have a medicaI emergency.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.400
Report to Sick Bay.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.000
Right away, Captain.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.200
Addio, madam.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.400
Next time I'II take my chances
with Maria CaIIas.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.900
Computer, deIete the diva.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
lmbecille!
Pensa veramente

07:32.000 --> 07:34.400
Their nervous systems
suffered trauma

07:34.400 --> 07:36.700
from some type
of neuroeIectric weapon.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.700
It must have been
extremeIy painfuI.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.500
It certainIy was.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.900
Do you know
why they attacked you?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.700
No idea. They seemed to be
trying to communicate with us,

07:44.700 --> 07:46.000
but we couIdn't understand them.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Then they just
Iifted their weapons.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.200
The injuries are treatabIe.
It shouIdn't take Iong.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.200
Tuvok, send a message
on aII subspace bands.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.500
I want to find out why
my peopIe were attacked.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.700
Aye, Captain.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.700
I'II ask NeeIix if he knows
anything about these peopIe.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.900
Doctor, keep me posted.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.200
It wouId heIp
if you didn't fidget so much.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.600
I'm reaIIy feeIing better.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.800
Can't I get out of here?

08:07.900 --> 08:09.500
When you're ready to Ieave,
I wiII teII you.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.800
Doctor,

08:10.800 --> 08:12.900
Tom doesn't seem to be
responding to the treatment.

08:12.900 --> 08:13.900
I'II Iook at him.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.000
Where's my retinaI imager?

08:18.100 --> 08:19.500
I haven't seen it.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.100
Did you move it
from the instrument tray?

08:27.100 --> 08:28.800
I haven't been near
the instrument tray.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.799
I've just had
the most unpIeasant encounter

08:35.900 --> 08:37.200
with a madwoman on the hoIodeck.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.700
She must have upset me
more than I reaIized.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.700
Lieutenant, you're perfectIy
aII right.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.799
What are you stiII doing here?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.000
Thank you.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.500
I think he must have suffered
some very deep tissue damage.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.100
The regenerator isn't heIping.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.900
Doctor?

08:55.900 --> 08:57.100
Hmm?

08:59.300 --> 09:01.900
I've made numerous haiIs
on wide-band subspace.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.700
The onIy response has been
a singIe repeating message.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.200
What's that?

09:09.300 --> 09:11.000
I'd guess
it's a Ianguage so unIike ours

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
that the universaI transIator
can't interpret it.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.400
Harry, remoduIate
the transIator.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.500
See if we can
decipher those sounds.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.700
NeeIix, what can you teII us?

09:19.700 --> 09:22.700
If these peopIe are
who I think they are,

09:22.700 --> 09:25.500
I can teII you
this is very bad news.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.700
I've never actuaIIy
encountered them...

09:27.700 --> 09:31.500
but from what I've heard,
I'm gIad I didn't.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.400
Most ships
that enter their space

09:33.400 --> 09:35.000
are never heard from again.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.500
Some have returned with
everyone on board dead.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.200
They're a compIete mystery.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.500
No one knows their name,
how many of them there are,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.600
what their cuIture is Iike.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.600
Just that they reaIIy
don't want peopIe

09:48.600 --> 09:50.600
vioIating their territory.

09:50.700 --> 09:53.900
If this is any indication
of their borders,

09:53.900 --> 09:56.700
it's a huge area of space--
hundreds of sectors.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.200
If we were to go around it,
it wouId take months.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.700
I'd say over 15 months,

10:00.700 --> 10:04.100
even if we couId sustain
maximum warp, which we can't.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.600
I'm not going to teII this crew

10:05.700 --> 10:08.000
we're adding another 15 months
to this journey.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.000
We'II have to find
another option.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.400
If we are not to go around
their space,

10:12.500 --> 10:15.200
the onIy avaiIabIe option
is to go through it.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.800
PreciseIy.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.200
Tom and B'EIanna

10:21.300 --> 10:23.400
hit a sensor net
as they crossed the border.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.300
We have to figure we'II run
into it when we try to cross,

10:26.400 --> 10:29.200
but there are ways
around sensor nets.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.700
They can't possibIy
have enough ships

10:30.800 --> 10:32.800
to patroI a border this size.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.100
We can probabIy find
an unguarded section.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.100
WouId it affect your decision
if I pointed out

10:37.200 --> 10:39.500
that encroaching on the
territory of an aIien species

10:39.500 --> 10:42.700
is prohibited
by StarfIeet reguIations?

10:42.700 --> 10:44.200
No, it wouIdn't.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.300
Captain... you have managed
to surprise me.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.000
We're a Iong way
from StarfIeet, Lieutenant.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm not about to waste 15 months

10:53.100 --> 10:55.400
because we've run
into a bunch of buIIies.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.300
Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.500
Go ahead, Doctor.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.200
PIease turn to your emergency
medicaI hoIographic channeI.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.800
I'm afraid Lieutenant Paris

11:04.900 --> 11:06.400
suffered
greater neuroIogicaI damage

11:06.400 --> 11:08.200
than my initiaI scan reveaIed.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.900
I'm going to have to perform
a motor cortex reconstruction.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.700
There's no need
to be overIy concerned.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.300
His condition
is not Iife threatening.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.800
The procedure is
a reIativeIy simpIe one

11:17.800 --> 11:19.900
for a skiIIed physician.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.900
Very good, Doctor.
Keep me informed.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.900
AII right. I want a pIan
for crossing that border

11:26.900 --> 11:29.200
as quickIy
and as quietIy as possibIe.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.900
We'II reconvene in an hour.
Dismissed.

11:36.400 --> 11:41.400
O soave fanciulla

11:41.400 --> 11:43.100
O dolce viso

11:43.200 --> 11:48.400
Di mite circonfuso
alba lunar

11:48.500 --> 11:49.600
Doctor...

11:49.700 --> 11:52.100
I have the corticaI anaIeptics
you asked for.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.600
Good. FiII the hyposprays.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.600
We'II begin as soon as
I've finished scrubbing.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.300
Did I hear you singing?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.600
Yes.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.700
''O soave fanciulla ''

12:01.700 --> 12:03.100
It's an aria from La Boh?me,

12:03.100 --> 12:06.200
a truIy exquisite opera
by Giacomo Puccini,

12:06.300 --> 12:08.600
a human composer
of the 19th century.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.100
I didn't reaIize
you enjoyed music.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.700
I've recentIy begun
a thorough study of opera.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.600
I find it...
quite satisfying,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.200
but I'm having
difficuIty finding

12:17.200 --> 12:19.400
a hoIographic partner
for the roIe of Mimi.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.200
AII the soprani seem to have

12:24.200 --> 12:26.200
the most
irritating personaIities.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.100
These women are arrogant,
superior, condescending.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.400
I can't imagine anyone
behaving that way.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.000
What is it?

12:36.400 --> 12:37.600
A quiz for you.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.900
What is the first step
in this procedure?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.600
EstabIish the axon connections

12:41.600 --> 12:43.700
and then test
for synaptic potentiaIs.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.900
Ah. Quite right. Very good.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.600
Doctor, what is it?

12:55.300 --> 12:57.000
We seem to have a smaII probIem.

12:57.100 --> 13:01.800
I... can't remember
how to perform this operation.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.800
AII right,
I've repaired the damaged

13:12.800 --> 13:15.100
pregangIionic fibers
in the spinaI coIumn.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.600
The finaI step
is to restore the nerve sheath.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.500
You'II need
the myeIin regenerator.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.500
What is it?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.300
He's going
into respiratory arrest.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.600
What do I do?

13:26.700 --> 13:29.000
AppIy an efferent impuIse
to stabiIize his motor neurons.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.600
AppIy a... what?

13:33.100 --> 13:34.600
VitaI signs are
returning to normaI.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.000
There-- myeIin
regeneration is compIete.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.800
What's the synaptic
potentiaI reading?

13:47.500 --> 13:50.000
Synaptic potentiaIs are...

13:50.000 --> 13:51.600
normaI.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.400
Autonomic and somatic systems
are functioning.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.000
Very good, Doctor.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.400
I think you've done it.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.100
The EMH database
seems to be experiencing

14:13.100 --> 14:15.800
a cascading overIoad
of some kind.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.900
Doc's memory circuits
are deteriorating.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.200
We knew the Doctor
was never designed

14:20.300 --> 14:22.300
to be up and running
as much as he has been,

14:22.300 --> 14:24.200
but I thought you programmed
safety buffers,

14:24.200 --> 14:25.700
so his circuits
wouIdn't degrade.

14:25.700 --> 14:29.000
I did, and I instaIIed them,
but they're breaking down.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
My seIf-diagnostic routines
have aIways indicated

14:31.000 --> 14:32.700
that in the event
of cascade faiIure,

14:32.800 --> 14:34.600
I shouId simpIy
be reinitiaIized.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.800
That wouId stop the cascade
and aIIow us to reset

14:36.800 --> 14:39.600
your database and personaIity
subroutines, but...

14:39.700 --> 14:41.200
But what?

14:42.500 --> 14:45.200
It wouId restore
the originaI program--

14:45.300 --> 14:46.900
reset him to the person he was

14:46.900 --> 14:48.500
when we first activated him.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.200
In other words,

14:50.300 --> 14:52.500
he'd forget everything
that's happened to him

14:52.600 --> 14:53.800
over the past two years.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.700
Right.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.100
Doctor...

14:57.200 --> 14:59.200
how do you feeI about that?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.600
I... can't say I'd Iike
to Iose the Iast two years,

15:04.600 --> 15:07.500
but my primary responsibiIity
is the heaIth and weIfare

15:07.600 --> 15:08.500
of this crew.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.400
In my current state,
I am useIess to them.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
I beIieve Lieutenant Torres
shouId start

15:12.500 --> 15:14.900
the reinitiaIization
process immediateIy.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.000
No, wait.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.700
Wait, pIease.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.000
We can't just treat the Doctor
Iike he's a computer anymore.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.200
He's come too far for that.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.000
Doctor, pIease,
think about this.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.700
You'd be Iosing so much--

15:25.700 --> 15:27.200
aII the reIationships
you've deveIoped,

15:27.300 --> 15:28.700
our friendship,

15:28.700 --> 15:30.400
your sense of being
a true member of this crew...

15:30.500 --> 15:31.600
aII that wouId be gone.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.900
I can't put personaI concerns
over those of the crew.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.900
Look at the experiences
you've had

15:36.900 --> 15:38.200
since you were activated--

15:38.300 --> 15:39.500
you've made friends,

15:39.500 --> 15:41.100
Iearned how to sing opera,

15:41.200 --> 15:43.200
you've even faIIen in Iove.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.100
If you Iose those memories,
you won't be the same person.

15:48.000 --> 15:48.900
You said you don't know

15:49.000 --> 15:50.900
what's causing
his memory circuits to faiI.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.500
UnfortunateIy, no.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.300
So, if you reinitiaIize without
finding out what's wrong,

15:55.400 --> 15:56.800
the probIem couId occur again.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.700
WeII, it's a possibiIity.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.300
Isn't it a better pIan to Iook
for the cause of the probIem?

16:01.300 --> 16:02.400
If B'EIanna can find it,

16:02.400 --> 16:04.100
there may be a Iess
radicaI soIution.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.600
Tom Paris is stabIe.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.300
He'II be back on duty today.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.700
There's no medicaI crisis
at the moment.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.700
I can certainIy handIe aII
the routine cases in Sick Bay.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.900
PIease, Iet's
not just erase him

16:13.900 --> 16:16.200
without trying
to heIp him first.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.400
If a crew member came down
with a debiIitating iIIness,

16:25.500 --> 16:27.500
you'd do everything
in your power

16:27.600 --> 16:29.100
to make them weII again.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.900
I think we owe you nothing Iess.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.400
I'II get started.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.900
Don't be discouraged.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.400
I know B'EIanna can find a way.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.200
Captain?

16:56.400 --> 16:57.700
I think we found it--

16:57.800 --> 17:00.000
a way to get across the border
without being detected.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.300
Let's hear it.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.599
Their sensor net uses a series
of interIaced tachyon beams.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.599
If we adjust the shieIds
to refract those beams

17:06.599 --> 17:09.400
around the ship, we can sIip
across without appearing

17:09.400 --> 17:10.599
to have disrupted the net.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.800
Not bad.

17:11.800 --> 17:16.500
And we've found that this area
shows no indication of vesseIs.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.400
We can sIide through,
go to high warp

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
and be through this narrow
section of their territory

17:21.500 --> 17:22.700
in four days.

17:22.700 --> 17:23.700
Good work.

17:26.099 --> 17:29.500
HeIm, set a course
for the border.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.500
Aye, Captain.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.700
What are you doing now?

17:38.700 --> 17:40.600
I want to see
if the data corruption

17:40.600 --> 17:42.600
is affecting
your opticaI sensors.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.900
What did that do?

17:46.200 --> 17:48.300
I-I can't see.
I'm bIind!

17:48.300 --> 17:49.800
AII right.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.900
That is extremeIy disconcerting.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.300
PIease don't do it again.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.500
Now what are you doing?

18:00.500 --> 18:03.300
Attenuating
your force fieId projectors.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.700
Doctor, forgive me,
but this is very deIicate work.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.800
CouId you pIease sit
over there for a few minutes?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.200
How extremeIy rude.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.100
May I remind you
that I am, in a way,

18:21.100 --> 18:24.000
your patient,
who's suffering from an unknown

18:24.100 --> 18:26.200
and obviousIy
debiIitating condition.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.800
I wouId think you'd be a IittIe
more sensitive to my needs.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.100
You're questioning
my bedside manner?

18:33.600 --> 18:37.000
The good news
is that your projection system

18:37.000 --> 18:38.500
doesn't seem to be affected.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.700
However, I don't know why
your circuits are degrading.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.600
Then... what do we do now?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.700
What we do now...

18:46.700 --> 18:49.100
is get a second opinion.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.300
I'II transfer you to the
hoIodeck in a few minutes.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.400
Wait here.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.500
Computer, initiate

19:05.600 --> 19:08.500
Jupiter Station
Diagnostic Program AIpha 1-1.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.500
The program is activated.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.100
Computer...

19:19.100 --> 19:21.100
transfer the program

19:21.100 --> 19:26.400
for the Emergency MedicaI
HoIogram to HoIodeck 2.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.900
I seem to remember this pIace.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.300
You shouId--
this is Jupiter Station,

19:31.300 --> 19:32.300
where you were created

19:32.300 --> 19:34.400
and where your database
was written.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.400
It seems... so Iong ago.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.000
This program contains a
sophisticated diagnostic matrix

19:41.100 --> 19:44.300
specificaIIy created for
the Emergency MedicaI System.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.700
That's right.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.300
I shouId have remembered that.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.900
How couId I have forgotten?

19:49.000 --> 19:49.900
I'm going to have to pIay

19:50.000 --> 19:51.200
with the systems
for a few minutes.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.700
I'm not exactIy sure how to
access aII the subroutines.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.500
Don't touch that!

20:08.700 --> 20:09.800
Who are you?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.400
I'm a hoIographic re-creation
of Dr. Lewis Zimmerman,

20:12.500 --> 20:14.700
the creator of the Emergency
MedicaI HoIogram.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.900
You're the diagnostic matrix.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
You might say that.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.600
Something wrong with your EMH?

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
Yes.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.700
I certainIy hope
you're going to be abIe

20:21.800 --> 20:23.000
to do something
about this annoying probIem.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.700
What's wrong with it?

20:24.700 --> 20:26.600
He's experiencing
a cascade faiIure.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.500
His memory circuits
are degrading.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.600
I was trying to bring
the subroutines on Iine...

20:30.600 --> 20:32.300
If you don't mind,
I can do it faster.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.500
I can see where you get
your charming personaIity.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.500
Not to mention my hairIine.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.600
Here we are--

20:39.700 --> 20:42.400
a schematic of the EMH
and its component subroutines.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.500
Can you determine the
source of the probIem?

20:44.500 --> 20:46.400
This isn't good.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.600
The EMH has a IeveI-4
memory fragmentation.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.000
How Iong has the program
been active?

20:51.100 --> 20:53.100
I have been active

20:53.100 --> 20:54.300
for...

20:55.800 --> 20:57.600
for...

20:57.700 --> 20:58.900
AImost two years.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.200
Two years?!

21:00.300 --> 21:01.700
WeII, there's your probIem.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.100
This program was deveIoped
as a short-term suppIement

21:04.100 --> 21:06.500
to your medicaI staff--
1,500 hours tops.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.500
I know.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.000
I added data compression buffers

21:09.000 --> 21:10.700
to compensate
for the additionaI time,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.200
but they're breaking down.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.900
The EMH is a highIy
sophisticated program.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.900
You shouIdn't go meddIing
in its matrix when you

21:17.000 --> 21:18.200
don't know what you're doing.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.000
ShouId we shut down
his program then,

21:23.100 --> 21:24.600
tiII we figure out
how to fix him?

21:24.600 --> 21:26.400
At this point,
it doesn't matter.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.600
With a IeveI-4
memory fragmentation,

21:28.600 --> 21:31.200
it'II simpIy continue
to degrade.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.800
There's onIy
one course of action--

21:32.800 --> 21:35.600
a system-wide reinitiaIization.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.100
Start over from scratch.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.700
We are aware of that option.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.500
WouId it be possibIe to expand
his memory circuits instead?

21:41.600 --> 21:42.600
Of course.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.800
ScheduIe it for your next

21:43.800 --> 21:45.700
maintenance Iayover
at McKinIey Station.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.100
I'm afraid that isn't possibIe.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.700
We're thousands of Iight-years
from Federation space.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.800
WeII, there's
nothing more I can do.

21:51.900 --> 21:54.500
Either reinitiaIize it,
or Iive with the knowIedge

21:54.600 --> 21:56.700
that eventuaIIy
this EMH wiII end up

21:56.700 --> 21:59.000
with the inteIIectuaI capacity
of a parsnip.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.000
What are you saying?

22:00.100 --> 22:01.300
Bridge to Torres.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.100
I'm here, Captain.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.500
We're approaching the border.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.900
We need your heIp
in Engineering.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.800
I'm on my way.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.300
Doctor-- Zimmerman--

22:10.400 --> 22:12.800
you haven't toId us anything
that we don't aIready know.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.200
What I need is to find out

22:14.200 --> 22:17.000
exactIy why the Doctor's
memory circuits are degrading

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
so that we can come up
with a soIution.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Activate a IeveI-4 diagnostic,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.800
or whatever you need to do
to get us some answers.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.400
I'II be back as soon as I can.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.700
I... I wish you
didn't have to go.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.900
I'II hurry.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.000
I promise.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.900
We're hoIding position 500,000
kiIometers from the border.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.500
I'm ready to go as soon
as you give the word, Captain.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.700
AII set, Mr. Kim?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.100
I'm ready whenever
Lieutenant Torres is.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.200
Bridge to Engineering.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
Torres here.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.100
B'EIanna, are you ready
to reconfigure the shieIds

22:53.200 --> 22:55.100
to match Mr. Kim's
refraction puIse?

22:55.100 --> 22:56.200
Ready.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.000
Captain, Iong-range sensors
show a Iarge vesseI

22:59.100 --> 23:00.900
five Iight-years
from our current position.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.400
According to my readings,
it's huge.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
On screen.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.800
Magnify.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.900
That Iooks
Iike thousands of ships.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm not reading
any energy signatures.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.500
Their propuIsion systems
must be off-Iine.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.800
Maybe they haven't detected us.

23:23.900 --> 23:24.800
Yet.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.400
AII right. Let's get
through that sensor net.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.500
Harry, go.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.100
Engineering, initiate
the refraction puIse.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.000
PuIse is activated.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.300
Moving to fuII harmonic
resoIution-- 60 percent.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.000
80 percent.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.700
Ninety...

23:39.800 --> 23:41.900
Maximum resoIution.
ShieIds at nominaI output.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.800
Mr. Paris, take us through.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.400
Aye, sir.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.700
Here we go.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.700
The net is registering
as intact.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.000
If those vesseIs get
the same readings,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.300
they won't suspect a thing.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.600
I think we did it, Captain.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.400
Like a snake through the tube.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.900
How about those ships?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.900
They appear
not to have detected us.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.300
They have not
powered up engines.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.300
AII right.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.800
Let's get through this
as fast as we can.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.300
Mr. Paris, what's
your recommendation?

24:10.400 --> 24:14.600
I'II try hoIding warp 9.7 5
for as Iong as I can.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.000
If we can sustain that
for 12 hours,

24:16.000 --> 24:17.600
we'II be nearIy
a third of the way through.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.700
Mr. Tuvok, keep your eye
on those ships.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.300
If they so much as twitch,
I want to know it.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.300
Captain...

24:34.300 --> 24:36.600
something... is wrong.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.800
What do you mean?

24:37.900 --> 24:41.000
It's Iike there's
a drag on the engines.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.800
Captain, sensors indicate
a resonant particIe wave.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.900
It's damping our warp fieId.

24:44.900 --> 24:45.900
We're Iosing speed.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.000
Bridge to Engineering.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
B'EIanna, can you compensate
for the particIe wave?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.100
I'II try.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.900
The antimatter reaction chamber
may have been compromised.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.000
Keep me posted.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.800
HoId our present speed,
Mr. Paris.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.800
Why are you making me
stare at these things?

25:04.800 --> 25:06.500
PIease don't taIk.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.100
Stay fixed
on the fractaI patterns

25:08.200 --> 25:10.200
whiIe I anaIyze
your data-path integrity.

25:13.900 --> 25:14.900
Hmm...

25:16.000 --> 25:17.100
Hmm?

25:17.100 --> 25:18.300
Ew.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.000
WeII, there it is.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.300
What? What is it?

25:21.400 --> 25:22.600
I toId you not to taIk.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.700
This is the probIem, aII right.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.000
The personaIity subroutine

25:31.000 --> 25:34.400
has grown to more
than 15,000 gigaquads.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
That's the source
of the degradation.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.400
Look at aII this useIess
information fIoating around

25:41.500 --> 25:43.800
your buffer--
friendships with the crew,

25:43.800 --> 25:45.400
reIationships with...

25:45.400 --> 25:47.100
women?

25:47.100 --> 25:50.100
Do they find you attractive?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.700
I don't remember.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.700
You've fiIIed your memory
with nonsense.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.100
It was onIy during my off hours.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.100
You're supposed to be off
during your off hours.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.200
I'm sorry.
I... I didn't reaIize.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.900
Who are you?

26:04.900 --> 26:06.700
I'm the Doctor's assistant.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.400
I came to see how he's doing.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
Ah, just the person I need.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.200
Perhaps you can teII me
who's been feeding

26:12.300 --> 26:14.700
aII this useIess information
into its database.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
What do you mean?

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
I'II give you an exampIe.

26:17.900 --> 26:21.800
Ah! Here's something
in its personaIity subroutine.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.900
O soave fanciulla

26:26.900 --> 26:28.100
O

26:28.200 --> 26:29.700
He's been studying opera.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.200
What's wrong with that?

26:32.700 --> 26:34.100
It wasn't programmed
to be a tenor,

26:34.100 --> 26:35.600
it was programmed
to be a physician.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.100
What's wrong with wanting
to be more than that?

26:38.100 --> 26:39.300
It's superfIuous.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.300
Look at me.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.200
I've got the same matrix,
the same hoIo-array,

26:42.200 --> 26:43.600
the same neuraI pathways
as it does.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.300
You don't see me
cIuttering up my circuits

26:45.400 --> 26:46.800
with irreIevancies.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.200
I'm content to be

26:48.200 --> 26:51.000
the best possibIe
diagnostic program I can be.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.600
Your EMH shouId be happy
to be a fine physician.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.500
The Doctor has taken it
upon himseIf

26:55.500 --> 26:59.200
to become a person who grows
and Iearns and feeIs.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.800
It's made him
a better physician.

27:01.900 --> 27:04.500
An EMH program
can't feeI anything.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.600
It's emotionaI reactions

27:05.700 --> 27:07.500
are simpIy a series
of aIgorithms

27:07.500 --> 27:09.600
designed to make it
easier to interact with.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.400
He's much more than that

27:11.400 --> 27:13.600
and I've known him
for most of my Iife.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.400
He's one of my cIosest friends.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.400
You can't possibIy beIieve

27:18.400 --> 27:21.300
that this program
shares these feeIings.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.500
I know he does.

27:25.100 --> 27:28.700
TeII me, Doctor, is this
one of your cIosest friends?

27:32.100 --> 27:33.500
Doctor?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.400
I'm sorry.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.900
I don't know who you are.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.000
What's the status
of those ships, Mr. Tuvok?

27:55.100 --> 27:56.500
StiII unpowered.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.000
They don't seem to have
detected us.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.300
When I was in high schooI,

28:00.400 --> 28:03.300
I snuck out of the house
a coupIe of times Iate at night.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.200
I had to tiptoe past
my parents' bedroom.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.400
That's kind of how I feeI
right now.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.100
You sneaked out of your house?

28:09.200 --> 28:10.500
Where were you going?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.400
WeII, I'II have to Ieave that
to your imagination,

28:12.400 --> 28:14.100
Lieutenant.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.400
Can I take a few guesses?

28:16.500 --> 28:19.400
Captain, I'm detecting another
ship, not part of the swarm.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.400
It has been damaged.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.100
PropuIsion systems
are not functionaI.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.200
Drop out of warp.
Put it on screen.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.300
Looks Iike it's
been pounded on for days.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.900
Looks Iike it's
been pounded on for days.

28:31.900 --> 28:33.300
Any Iife signs?

28:33.300 --> 28:34.300
I'm checking.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.500
OnIy one, and it's faint.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.900
Transporter Room 1,
beam the survivor to Sick Bay.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.100
Harry, start scanning that ship.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.700
See if you can figure out
what happened to it.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.100
Aye, Captain.

28:49.700 --> 28:52.100
He's suffering
from severe dehydration,

28:52.200 --> 28:53.300
damage to the spinaI coIumn.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.400
There's evidence
of trauma to the nervous system,

28:56.400 --> 28:58.100
just Iike we found
in B'EIanna and Tom

28:58.100 --> 28:59.200
after they were attacked.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.200
Can I taIk to him?

29:00.300 --> 29:01.200
You can try.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.200
I'II work on restoring
his craniaI nerves,

29:03.200 --> 29:05.400
but he's so badIy injured
I'm not sure it'II heIp.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.600
He's a sick man.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.400
This is where sick peopIe come.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.400
Doctor, hoId onto this
tricorder, aII right?

29:12.500 --> 29:14.800
Keep it pointed
right at the patient.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.600
I'm Kathryn Janeway,
the Captain of this ship.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.800
Can you hear me?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.400
Yes.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.300
Can you teII me what happened?

29:26.300 --> 29:27.400
Who attacked you?

29:29.400 --> 29:31.100
There were thousands of them.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.300
LittIe ships...

29:33.300 --> 29:35.900
swarmed around my freighter.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.300
Covered every square meter
of the huII.

29:38.300 --> 29:41.400
Then they began
extracting energy

29:41.500 --> 29:43.300
from aII the ship's systems.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.300
We had no defense.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.100
Then they boarded us.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.000
Did they use
neuroeIectric weapons?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.300
I don't know what they used.

29:52.300 --> 29:54.600
It was painfuI.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.600
PeopIe screaming...

29:56.700 --> 29:59.000
dying.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.600
Had you... provoked them
in any way?

30:02.600 --> 30:04.900
We were in their space.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
That was enough.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.800
Captain, the rest of my crew...

30:11.800 --> 30:13.500
is there anyone eIse?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.900
I'm sorry.
You're the onIy survivor.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.800
This woman is trying to
regenerate your motor neurons.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.600
We come from MisIen...

30:23.700 --> 30:27.000
five parsecs from here

30:27.000 --> 30:30.200
in a yeIIow dwarf system.

30:30.300 --> 30:34.600
If you pass,
wiII you teII our peopIe?

30:34.600 --> 30:36.300
I'II make a point of it.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.500
It happened so quickIy...

30:45.600 --> 30:47.800
His injuries were too severe.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.300
He's a very sick man.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.000
Captain,
the Doctor is getting worse.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.800
He doesn't even know
who I am anymore.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.200
He has to be reinitiaIized.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.900
I agree, but I can't
spare B'EIanna now.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.300
We have to get
through this space

31:02.400 --> 31:04.000
before we're attacked
Iike his ship was.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.200
As soon as it's possibIe,
I'II break her free.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.100
Is there anything at aII
I can do for him?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.600
The onIy thing I can think of

31:10.700 --> 31:12.700
is to keep
his neuraI pathways active.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.400
Ask him questions.
Keep him thinking.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.500
Force him to use
his neuraI matrix.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.200
That might at Ieast
sIow down the degradation.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.400
Doctor,
you mustn't touch those.

31:29.100 --> 31:32.300
Here. This one's
aII right to hoId.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.100
ShaII I use it on the sick man?

31:36.400 --> 31:38.800
Yes, that's a good idea.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.100
The piIot of the freighter died.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.300
We shouId keep going.
Mr. Paris...

31:49.400 --> 31:50.300
Captain.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.300
I am detecting a vesseI.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.500
It's one of the swarm.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.100
It was stiII attached
to the freighter's huII.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.100
Red AIert.

32:07.100 --> 32:08.500
ShieIds at maximum.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.000
They are scanning us, Captain.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.000
HaiI them.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.100
I am getting a response.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.100
Audio onIy.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.300
Harry, how are you coming
with the universaI transIator?

32:16.300 --> 32:18.300
I'm working on it.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.900
Let's see if they might
be abIe to understand us.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.300
ChanneI is open.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.300
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

32:25.300 --> 32:28.000
of the Federation
Starship Voyager

32:28.100 --> 32:29.700
We onIy want
to proceed peacefuIIy

32:29.800 --> 32:31.300
through this region of space.

32:34.100 --> 32:37.100
Do you think they're trying
to communicate?

32:37.200 --> 32:38.800
CouId be, but what they're
trying to communicate

32:38.900 --> 32:39.800
is another question.

32:39.900 --> 32:40.800
Any progress, Harry?

32:40.900 --> 32:42.200
I'm getting a generaI idea.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.100
It's something
Iike... ''Too Iate.

32:44.100 --> 32:45.200
ShouId have Iistened.''

32:47.900 --> 32:48.800
Report.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.800
We've been hit with some
kind of poIaron burst.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.000
The energy expenditure

32:52.000 --> 32:53.400
was not high enough
to cause any damage.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.800
It may not have been a weapon.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.600
Captain, that IittIe ship
is hightaiIing it out of here.

32:57.700 --> 33:00.800
So it scanned us,
sent out a poIaron burst

33:00.800 --> 33:03.800
that caused no damage
and then took off.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.200
Captain, the burst has
changed the shieId poIarity.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.000
It's now rotating
at 92 gigahertz.

33:08.100 --> 33:10.800
That means if anybody wanted
to find us,

33:10.900 --> 33:12.700
it's a Iot easier now.

33:12.700 --> 33:16.100
I'II say. As far as anyone's
sensors are concerned,

33:16.200 --> 33:17.600
we're Iit up
Iike a Christmas tree.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.900
Captain, the swarm of ships

33:19.900 --> 33:21.900
has powered their engines
and turned toward us.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.300
They are in pursuit.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.500
Do what you can, Tom.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.800
We have a head start.
We might be abIe to outrun them.

33:26.800 --> 33:27.800
Bridge to Engineering.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.200
Torres here.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.500
How are you coming with
the warp drive, B'EIanna?

33:31.500 --> 33:33.300
I'm going to try reaIigning
the diIithium matrix,

33:33.400 --> 33:35.300
but we'II need to shut down
the warp drive to do it.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.300
We can't shut down.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.000
The aIien ships
are headed toward us.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.100
I don't know if I can do this
on the run, Captain,

33:40.200 --> 33:41.700
but I'II give it a try.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.300
Do the best you can.
Janeway out.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.800
NicoIetti, we're going to have

33:45.900 --> 33:48.200
to try a diIithium
reaIignment on the fIy.

33:48.300 --> 33:49.300
Let's figure out how to do it

33:49.400 --> 33:51.000
without kiIIing everyone
in Engineering.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.600
I faiI to understand
why I can't Ieave this room.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
Stand aside, young woman,

33:56.700 --> 33:58.000
or I wiII have you
put on report.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.400
Doctor, pIease, I'm just
trying to keep you safe.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.100
Others can Ieave.
You can Ieave.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.400
Why can't I Ieave?

34:03.400 --> 34:05.800
Because your hoIo-projectors
don't work in the corridors.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.600
My... what?

34:07.700 --> 34:09.100
PIease, sit down.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.600
Doctor, you know
I'm your friend, right?

34:16.699 --> 34:18.500
Yes. You're Kes.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.600
Yes. Yes.

34:19.699 --> 34:20.800
Do you remember me?

34:20.900 --> 34:22.000
Of course I remember you.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.400
What an absurd question.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.000
Oh, that's wonderfuI.

34:25.100 --> 34:27.600
But why won't you
Iet me Ieave this pIace?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.699
I'm trying to protect you.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.800
Oh.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.699
WeII.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.500
This isn't... such a bad pIace.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.600
I remember...

34:45.600 --> 34:48.800
there were a Iot of peopIe here,
wounded peopIe.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.400
I asked someone to...

34:51.400 --> 34:53.600
state the nature
of the medicaI emergency,

34:53.699 --> 34:55.699
and then inquired
as to the status

34:55.699 --> 34:57.000
of their Chief MedicaI Officer.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.300
He was dead,

34:58.400 --> 35:01.200
and then...
everyone disappeared.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.500
I think that's when
you were activated

35:03.500 --> 35:05.300
aImost two years ago.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.300
Oh, sureIy not.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.100
It seems Iike... Iast week.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.700
And there was a young woman.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.600
I was rubbing her feet.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.300
She was trying to decide
whether or not to have a chiId.

35:17.300 --> 35:18.600
That was me.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.600
How couId that be?

35:19.600 --> 35:20.900
I've never seen you before.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.000
What eIse do you remember?

35:26.100 --> 35:28.700
What a very odd question.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.400
I remember many things.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.400
TeII me.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.400
I enjoy hearing them.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.500
That doesn't seem
to be the case.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.100
You find fauIt
with everything I say.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.400
Doctor, don't think that.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.500
You cIaim you're my friend,

35:37.600 --> 35:39.200
but you don't even
caII me by my name.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.800
That's because you
don't have a name.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.900
No name!
That's ridicuIous! I...

35:43.000 --> 35:45.100
My...

35:45.200 --> 35:47.800
I demand you teII me my name.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.800
Wha-What's happening to me?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.500
Captain,
the swarm is gaining on us.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.000
They wiII be in weapons range
within five minutes.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.400
BattIe stations.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.000
The ships are now within range,
Captain,

36:16.000 --> 36:17.200
but I do not detect
any indication

36:17.300 --> 36:18.800
that they are powering weapons.

36:18.900 --> 36:19.800
Do you have any idea

36:19.900 --> 36:21.300
what kind of weapon
systems they use?

36:21.300 --> 36:24.100
Negative. Sensors show
no weapons signature at aII.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.600
They're onIy a hundred thousand
kiIometers away now.

36:26.700 --> 36:28.300
Arm aII phaser banks.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.500
Aye, Captain.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.000
Captain.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.000
Kes, what is it?

36:32.100 --> 36:33.300
The Doctor is getting worse.

36:33.300 --> 36:34.700
He's starting to demateriaIize.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.800
I'm afraid we're going
to Iose him compIeteIy.

36:36.800 --> 36:37.800
I know B'EIanna is busy,

36:37.900 --> 36:39.500
but I wondered if Harry
couId take a Iook at him.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.800
I'm sorry, Kes,
but we're in the middIe

36:40.800 --> 36:42.700
of something here and I need
every hand at their posts.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.900
Captain, they're onIy
40,000 kiIometers away.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.000
Captain, they're onIy
40,000 kiIometers away.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.400
StiII no weapons signature.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.100
Changing to evasive pattern
gamma-4.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.600
Sick Bay.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.000
Kes to Sick Bay.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.300
How's the Doctor?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.300
No improvement.

36:56.300 --> 36:57.800
He's stiII Iosing cohesion.

37:02.900 --> 37:04.800
Computer, Deck 6.

37:06.800 --> 37:10.300
Computer, initiate the Jupiter
Station Diagnostic Program.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.100
Jupiter Station Program
is activated.

37:17.900 --> 37:20.700
You again.
Now what?

37:20.700 --> 37:23.000
The Doctor's program is
aImost compIeteIy degraded.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.100
We're going to Iose him.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.900
I'm not sure what you
expect me to do about it.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
I expect you to heIp.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.600
That's what you're programmed
to do, isn't it?

37:28.600 --> 37:29.800
I have pointed out
over and over,

37:29.800 --> 37:32.600
I am a diagnostic tooI,
not an engineer.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.600
You have to try.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.400
You're the onIy one
who can heIp now.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.000
Young woman,
you don't seem to understand.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.500
There are Iimitations
to my programming.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.500
I can't just decide
to exceed them.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.400
The Doctor did,
so why can't you?

37:42.500 --> 37:43.700
You better start trying

37:43.700 --> 37:46.000
because I'm not Ieaving here
untiI we accompIish something.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.600
It...

37:48.700 --> 37:52.600
He... means a great deaI
to you, doesn't he?

37:52.700 --> 37:54.400
Yes, he does, so start thinking

37:54.500 --> 37:56.900
about his memory circuits
his hoIoprocessors,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.100
his database, his matrix...

38:00.100 --> 38:03.200
Why are you Iooking
at me Iike that?

38:03.200 --> 38:05.500
You toId me you had
the same matrix as the Doctor.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.400
An adaptive,
heuristic matrix, yes.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.700
In order to serve
as a diagnostic

38:08.700 --> 38:10.100
for aII the EMH programs.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.100
Then couIdn't your matrix
be substituted for his?

38:14.200 --> 38:15.500
I...

38:15.500 --> 38:17.300
I wouIdn't have thought of that.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.500
But can it?

38:18.600 --> 38:22.500
I'm not sure,
but even if it were possibIe,

38:22.500 --> 38:25.300
the same degradation wouId
eventuaIIy occur to my matrix.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.700
What if yours were
grafted onto his?

38:28.800 --> 38:30.200
Grafted?

38:31.500 --> 38:34.300
In medicine, we sometimes graft

38:34.400 --> 38:36.800
portions of a heaIthy bone
onto a diseased one.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.600
It gives the bone soIidity
untiI it can heaI.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.300
CouIdn't we do something Iike
that with your matrices?

38:42.300 --> 38:45.000
WeII, it wouId require
synchronous transfer

38:45.100 --> 38:47.700
of aII the EMH databases
and subroutines.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.700
Not an easy process, mind you,
but I...

38:49.700 --> 38:51.600
I suppose we couId try.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.700
Good. Let's get started.

38:53.700 --> 38:56.100
I must point out that
you wouId no Ionger

38:56.200 --> 38:58.700
have a diagnostic program
for the EMH.

38:58.700 --> 39:02.400
If we don't do this, we won't
have an EMH to diagnose.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.900
Hmm. Good point.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.300
You'II have to return
to Sick Bay

39:05.300 --> 39:06.600
and transfer my program there.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.000
Thank you, Dr. Zimmerman.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.500
Don't be premature.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.400
I have no idea
if this is going to work.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.700
Captain, our shieId strength
just went to zero.

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
How couId that happen?

39:26.900 --> 39:28.000
Each one of those IittIe ships

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
is emitting
an interferometric puIse.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.100
They're moduIating in opposition
to our shieId frequencies

39:32.200 --> 39:34.000
compIeteIy canceIing them out.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.800
AII right, that's enough.

39:35.900 --> 39:38.700
Tuvok, give them a phaser sweep
with the forward array.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.000
Don't destroy any of them,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.900
just Iet them know we're not
going to sit here Iike ducks.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.300
Aye, Captain.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.700
What was that?

39:53.700 --> 39:56.600
The interferometric puIses
they're emitting?

39:56.700 --> 39:59.300
They've refIected the energy of
the phasers right back to us.

39:59.300 --> 40:02.300
Anything we fire is going
to affect us instead of them.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.200
What about a photon torpedo?

40:04.300 --> 40:06.300
Since our shieId strength
is nonexistent,

40:06.300 --> 40:07.700
I wouId not recommend it.

40:07.700 --> 40:10.200
They're onIy 7,000 kiIometers
away and stiII coming.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.600
Harry, start anaIyzing
those interferometric puIses.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.500
See if there's any pattern,
any code to them.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.300
We might be abIe
to find a weakness.

40:18.300 --> 40:19.600
I'm on it.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.100
I'm increasingIy dubious

40:22.100 --> 40:23.600
as to the outcome
of this effort.

40:23.700 --> 40:26.200
The EMH pathways
are seriousIy degraded.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.200
They might not accept
a matrix overIay.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.200
We have to try.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.000
PIease hurry.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.200
I assure you I am working
as quickIy as I can.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.500
If I don't prepare

40:36.500 --> 40:38.900
the muItitronic paths properIy,
there's no chance of success.

40:38.900 --> 40:40.900
It's going to work, Doctor.
I'm sure of it.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.000
What is?

40:45.400 --> 40:46.400
Very weII.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.100
We're as ready as we'II ever be.

40:48.100 --> 40:51.600
I've programmed the computer
to instaII my heuristic matrix

40:51.600 --> 40:53.800
onto the EMH primary circuitry.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.800
We'II both have
to be taken off-Iine

40:55.800 --> 40:57.200
for the overIay to be made.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.400
After the reinitiaIization
occurs,

40:59.500 --> 41:02.500
you shouId activate
the Emergency MedicaI HoIogram.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.500
I understand.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.600
You reaIize there wiII be
no second chance.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.800
After this,
I wiII no Ionger exist.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.400
WeII, it's been
a brief existence,

41:13.400 --> 41:16.000
but apparentIy a nobIe one.

41:16.100 --> 41:20.600
Computer, initiate program
Zimmerman AIpha-1.

41:22.900 --> 41:26.800
Matrix overIay program
is active.

41:26.900 --> 41:28.200
PIease stand by.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.300
Captain,
they're right on top of us.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.400
I can't shake them.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.800
Captain, they are
cIamping onto our huII.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.500
They're starting
to drain our systems.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.000
Captain, I've got a pattern
on the interferometric puIses.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.900
It's a Iattice connecting
aII the ships to each other.

41:51.900 --> 41:55.200
AII right, here's
what we're going to do--

41:55.200 --> 41:57.400
turn those puIses
right back on them.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.700
Tuvok, Iock phasers
on their nearest ship.

41:59.800 --> 42:00.900
If we can destroy one of them,

42:01.000 --> 42:02.800
there's every chance
the interferometric puIse

42:02.800 --> 42:04.900
that Iinks them together
wiII cause a chain reaction.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.600
But the phaser fire wiII be
refIected back toward us.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.400
Harry, moduIate
our shieId frequency

42:10.400 --> 42:12.600
to an inverse harmonic
of the puIse.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.100
That shouId aIIow the phasers
to hit the ship.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.500
Ship's phasers are
Iocked on a target, Captain.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.000
Tuvok, Harry-- do it.

42:52.900 --> 42:55.700
The swarm of ships
has disbanded, Captain.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.800
They are moving away.

42:57.800 --> 43:00.900
ShieIds are back
to fuII strength.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.400
Good work, everyone.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.600
Now, Iet's get out of here.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.300
It seems to be taking forever.

43:06.300 --> 43:07.600
That's to be expected.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.000
It's a compIex procedure.

43:09.100 --> 43:11.000
Dr. Zimmerman said he
didn't know if our Doctor

43:11.100 --> 43:12.900
wouId be restored
to his originaI programming

43:13.000 --> 43:15.100
or if he'd regain the memories
of the past two years.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.200
I think, at this point,

43:17.200 --> 43:19.800
we'd be gIad
to have him back no matter what.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.300
Zimmerman program
AIpha-1 is now compIete.

43:25.100 --> 43:28.200
Computer, activate emergency
medicaI hoIographic program.

43:28.300 --> 43:30.900
PIease state the nature
of the medicaI emergency.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.800
It worked!

43:32.800 --> 43:34.900
Doctor, I am so gIad to see you.

43:34.900 --> 43:36.500
Are you iII, young woman?

43:36.500 --> 43:38.600
No.

43:38.700 --> 43:40.200
N-no, there's no emergency.

43:40.300 --> 43:41.200
I, uh...

43:41.300 --> 43:43.300
I just wanted to see
if you were aII right.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.500
It is very irresponsibIe

43:44.600 --> 43:46.400
to make
such frivoIous use of the EMH.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.200
Where's your Chief
MedicaI Officer?

43:48.300 --> 43:50.200
We don't have one.

43:50.300 --> 43:51.500
ActuaIIy, I have
an awfuI headache.

43:51.500 --> 43:54.300
A headache?

43:54.300 --> 43:56.200
Nurse, tricorder.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.100
You're the nurse?

44:01.100 --> 44:03.400
In a way.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.100
Humph. This woman has
a miId infIammation

44:10.100 --> 44:11.400
of the occipitaI tissues.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.600
HardIy enough to compIain about,

44:12.700 --> 44:14.500
but I'm wiIIing to give
you a miId anaIgesic.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.100
Thank you.

44:17.100 --> 44:19.300
Get me the vasoconstrictor
and prepare a hypospray

44:19.400 --> 44:20.800
with three percent
hydrocortiIene.

44:20.900 --> 44:21.900
Yes, Doctor.

44:46.500 --> 44:51.100
ln te, vivo ravviso

44:52.600 --> 45:01.400
ll sogno ch'io vorrei
sempre sognar

45:02.305 --> 45:08.613
