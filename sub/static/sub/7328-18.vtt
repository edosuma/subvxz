( applause and cheering )

00:05.173 --> 00:07.608
MAN:
What's going on, Virginia Beach?

00:07.641 --> 00:09.043
( cheering )
Yo, yo.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.478
Y'all ready to get this started?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.113
( cheering and shouting )

00:12.146 --> 00:13.514
Are you ready?

00:13.547 --> 00:15.183
Hey, how you feeling?

00:15.216 --> 00:16.150
Maybe you didn't hear me.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.219
I said, how are you feeling,
Virginia Beach?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.254
( loud cheering )

00:20.288 --> 00:21.255
All right.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.424
Y'all ready for me
to bring out these women?!

00:23.457 --> 00:25.826
( applause and cheering )

00:25.859 --> 00:27.528
All right, all right,
let's get started.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.164
Our first contestant
is a teacher, and enjoys

00:30.198 --> 00:32.666
long, hard... math problems.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.667
( audience groaning )

00:33.701 --> 00:35.203
Please give a
warm welcome

00:35.236 --> 00:36.270
to Monica.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.207
( applause, cheering
and whistling )

00:40.208 --> 00:41.375
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.710
God bless you, baby.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.148
MAN:
All right, our
next young lady

00:47.181 --> 00:48.449
is a Capricorn,

00:48.482 --> 00:50.551
and one of Jamel's
personal favorites.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.786
Say hello to Tina.

00:52.820 --> 00:53.854
* Check it out

00:53.887 --> 00:56.524
( applause, cheering
and whistling )

00:56.557 --> 00:58.592
* Check it, check it out

01:00.194 --> 01:03.331
* Check it out...

01:03.364 --> 01:04.432
MAN:
Our third

01:04.465 --> 01:05.799
contestant is a Navy girl.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.168
So stand at
attention, boys.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.603
This is the
beautiful Tiffany.

01:09.637 --> 01:13.141
( applause and cheering )

01:14.642 --> 01:17.511
Do we have a contestant
number three?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.313
MAN:
Well, apparently,

01:19.347 --> 01:21.315
Tiffany had some place better
to be.

01:29.657 --> 01:33.394
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:33.427 --> 01:38.266
and CBS

02:10.264 --> 02:12.733
( elevator bell dings )

02:14.368 --> 02:15.569
What's new, pussycat?

02:15.603 --> 02:16.537
Hey, Tony.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.771
Diggin' the
tie. Is it new?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.173
Yeah.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.442
I just got it last weekend.
It's Zegna.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.543
I like.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.711
I'm glad.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.145
Paid over a hundred bucks
for it.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.250
Why do you always do that?

02:29.283 --> 02:30.351
What?

02:30.384 --> 02:33.421
You always have
to announce how
much you paid

02:33.454 --> 02:35.256
for your clothes.
It's weird.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.590
What's weird?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.426
Abby asked me a question
about my tie.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.727
I answered.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.962
It's called a conversation,
Kate.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.497
No. Abby asked you
if it was new.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.599
She didn't ask you
how much you paid for it.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.335
The two things
have no correlation.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.636
Yeah, if I didn't pay for it,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.604
then it wouldn't be new now,
would it?

02:50.638 --> 02:53.807
Look, what is the point
of bragging to us

02:53.841 --> 02:55.509
about how much
you spend on
your clothes?

02:55.543 --> 02:56.277
We work with you.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.978
We all know how
much you make.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.480
I don't.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.250
KATE:
Look, all
I'm trying

03:02.283 --> 03:02.950
to say is
that it's not

03:02.983 --> 03:03.951
very professional.

03:03.984 --> 03:04.852
Gibbs would never walk in here

03:04.885 --> 03:06.654
and tell us how much
he paid for his shirt.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.621
That's because

03:07.655 --> 03:09.590
the prices have been
pretty consistent at Sears

03:09.623 --> 03:10.624
since the late '70s.

03:10.658 --> 03:11.659
GIBBS:
We have a body

03:11.692 --> 03:12.793
in Virginia Beach.

03:14.462 --> 03:14.962
McGee?

03:14.995 --> 03:16.464
Yeah.
Call Ducky.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.465
You got it.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.433
Hey, uh, boss, have you
had a chance to sign off

03:19.467 --> 03:20.734
on that missing persons
report I gave you?

03:20.768 --> 03:21.869
No, DiNozzo, I haven't.

03:21.902 --> 03:22.870
I tried to get to it

03:22.903 --> 03:24.004
last night,

03:24.037 --> 03:25.973
but Sears was having a sale.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.909
( elevator bell dings )

03:29.943 --> 03:32.380
( siren whoops )

03:33.314 --> 03:34.415
MAN:
So when you found the body,

03:34.448 --> 03:36.216
you were alone?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.386
I give it five seconds.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.420
Until what?

03:39.453 --> 03:40.754
Until he notices there was...

03:40.788 --> 03:42.290
Bikini contest?!

03:42.323 --> 03:44.325
TONY:
Eight's my
lucky number.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.627
It's over, DiNozzo.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.229
Gear up.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.400
Agent Gibbs?

03:54.435 --> 03:56.604
Lieutenant Sommers,
Virginia Beach Police.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.339
I assume you want
to take this one.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.607
You assume correctly,
Lieutenant.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.908
As soon as we
found her Norfolk

04:00.941 --> 04:02.910
I.D. card,
we cleared out.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.978
I brought in extra men
just to seal off the area.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.348
Bikini doesn't leave much room
for an I.D.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.516
( garbled radio transmission )

04:08.549 --> 04:11.352
There was a small beach bag
next to her in the stall.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.754
What is Volt Entertainment?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.489
It's a local
cable channel

04:15.523 --> 04:16.524
that caters to men.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.558
They air all
of the contests.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.593
I'll get a dub.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.994
Who discovered the body?

04:21.028 --> 04:23.297
An elderly woman
at about 1400.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.766
She notified one of
my men shortly after.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.535
She was pretty frantic.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.569
Where is she?

04:28.602 --> 04:31.572
She's in my
car back there.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.342
You don't want
to see her, Agent Gibbs?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.175
Kate.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.777
He's not really one
for chit-chat.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.778
I can see that.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.813
Are there any more girls
from the bikini contest?

04:39.847 --> 04:40.614
GIBBS:
Hey.

04:40.648 --> 04:41.649
DiNozzo!

04:41.682 --> 04:43.684
Right behind you, boss!

04:45.819 --> 04:49.490
That is one hell
of a swirlie.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.359
Swirlie?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.527
You take the kid by the ankles,
dunk him in the toilet,

04:53.561 --> 04:54.495
then flush.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.030
Usually reserved
for dorks.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.932
Does it look familiar, Probie?

04:58.966 --> 05:02.035
I don't think so.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.504
Noogies,

05:03.537 --> 05:06.407
sure. Wedgies, an
occasional melvin,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.709
but, uh, no...

05:08.742 --> 05:12.045
If you two don't start working,
I will show you hazing.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.013
And the Marine Corps

05:13.046 --> 05:15.983
does not do wedgies
or noogies or melvins.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.919
Thank you, boss.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.990
DiNozzo, measure
and sketch these
footprints.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.693
You think she made 'em, boss?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.795
Well, they match her shoes.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.962
Not smudged.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.664
No sign of panic.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.966
Think she went to the
toilet voluntarily?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.702
GIBBS:
No sign of a struggle.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.671
No bruises on her arms or neck.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.075
Why wouldn't she run
or fight back?

05:42.109 --> 05:43.711
Maybe she didn't
have a chance to.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.613
She could have been
in the vomiting position

05:45.646 --> 05:46.914
when she was attacked.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.649
That's good, DiNozzo.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.817
Thanks, boss.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.653
Now get on the floor
and start sketching
the footprints.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.854
It's a public
restroom, boss.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.022
It's really disgusting.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.390
It could be worse.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.691
How could it be worse?!

05:57.725 --> 05:59.960
Could be a men's room.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.101
( indistinct chatter,
seabirds cheeping )

06:08.135 --> 06:10.037
Ah, Jethro.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.540
Hey, Duck.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.942
DiNozzo and McGee'll be done
in a few minutes.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.677
Oh, no hurry.
It takes time

06:16.710 --> 06:18.912
to do detailed
and concise work.

06:18.946 --> 06:22.583
Mr. Palmer here
finishes his work
quite quickly.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.051
Thank you, Doctor.
( siren whoops )

06:24.084 --> 06:26.454
MAN ( over loudspeaker ):
People, please clear
the boardwalk.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.655
Well, thank you, Sergeant Klein.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.856
You have been very helpful.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.624
KLEIN:
My pleasure.
Thanks.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.727
Her name was Petty Officer
Tiffany Jordan.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.430
Her C.O. said she was deployed
on the USS Monroe

06:36.464 --> 06:37.898
for the last 57 days.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.734
Ship returned to port yesterday
at about this time.

06:40.768 --> 06:41.702
What did the witness say?

06:41.735 --> 06:44.605
She doesn't usually
use public rest rooms.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.939
Has a phobia.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.174
Well, this won't help.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.576
Victim's address?

06:48.609 --> 06:51.612
9375 Rosewood Drive, Norfolk.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.581
Come on, let's go.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.452
She is all yours, boys.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.953
Thank you,
gentlemen.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.154
( seabirds peeping )

07:01.188 --> 07:02.856
Mr. Palmer...

07:02.890 --> 07:04.558
I love the beach.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.627
Reminds me of college.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.629
I thought you went
to Ohio State.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.965
I'm talking about
spring break, Probie.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.702
Every year my buddies
and I hop in the car

07:14.735 --> 07:16.670
and head down to Panama City.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.640
Yeah, at MIT, we never did
the whole spring break thing.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.709
Go figure.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.511
( indistinct chatter )

07:23.544 --> 07:25.679
Hey, so was it as wild
as it looks on MTV?

07:25.713 --> 07:27.848
Probie, my stories alone
could make you a man.

07:27.881 --> 07:28.916
( chuckles )

07:30.017 --> 07:31.719
( giggling )

07:33.754 --> 07:35.689
Something wrong, Doctor?

07:35.723 --> 07:38.792
Her head is in the
toilet, Mr. Palmer.

07:38.826 --> 07:39.660
Right. Sorry.

07:39.693 --> 07:43.697
I've just never seen you
hesitate before.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.865
Well, when a person is

07:44.898 --> 07:46.767
as experienced as
I am, it's rare

07:46.800 --> 07:49.002
to come across something
you've never seen before.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.638
How long has she been here?

07:50.671 --> 07:53.006
Roughly two, maybe three hours.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.508
That is incredible.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.909
You know, you-you
have a real gift.

07:55.943 --> 07:56.910
( chuckles )

07:56.944 --> 07:58.612
Give yourself time, Mr. Palmer.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.614
I've been doing this

08:00.648 --> 08:02.783
since long before
you were a twinkle

08:02.816 --> 08:03.817
in your mother's eye.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.719
Or even your mother's mother.

08:05.753 --> 08:06.987
( laughs )

08:09.823 --> 08:11.692
You know,
some people find it strange...

08:11.725 --> 08:12.626
( grunts )

08:12.660 --> 08:13.994
our profession.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.996
Yes, so I've heard.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.865
Did you ever consider
another line of work?

08:17.898 --> 08:18.866
I suppose so.

08:18.899 --> 08:19.767
Yes, I think

08:19.800 --> 08:22.269
there comes a time
in everybody's life

08:22.302 --> 08:24.271
when they stop and wonder
if what they're doing

08:24.304 --> 08:25.773
is meaningful.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.107
It's only healthy.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.942
Really? What other kind
of, uh, career did you...?

08:28.976 --> 08:31.011
Shortly after I graduated from
Edinburgh Medical School,

08:31.044 --> 08:32.713
I gave serious
consideration

08:32.746 --> 08:33.814
to a career
in teaching.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.117
Yes, in fact, I-I heard
there was a vacancy at Eton,

08:37.150 --> 08:39.019
my alma mater.
I almost applied.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.654
Well, why didn't you...?

08:40.688 --> 08:42.756
I loved the idea
of teaching the
world's youth.

08:42.790 --> 08:43.957
Yeah.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.093
But then I realized
that deep down,

08:46.126 --> 08:47.828
academia was not for me.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.630
I could never
picture myself

08:49.663 --> 08:52.065
giving those
long, rambling,

08:52.099 --> 08:53.834
esoteric lectures.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.002
( laughs )

08:55.035 --> 08:56.904
Me, either, Doctor.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.942
Well, let's get you out of here,
my dear.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.052
She keeps a clean place.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.020
GIBBS:
Yeah.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
Well, she probably didn't see
much of it.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.825
Battling the Bulge

09:17.858 --> 09:19.793
by Jeff Drixon.

09:19.827 --> 09:22.863
Looks to me
like Jeff is losing the battle.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.864
( laughs )

09:23.897 --> 09:25.599
How to Lose 15 Pounds

09:25.633 --> 09:27.267
in 15 Days,
Losing is a Choice.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.269
They're all weight-loss books.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.140
These are all workout videos.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.775
Preoccupied with weight loss,

09:34.808 --> 09:36.309
vomiting before her attack.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.812
Sounds like an eating disorder.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.820
KATE:
Gibbs,

09:46.854 --> 09:49.022
take a look at this.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.158
"Tiff, I hope you
enjoyed my letters.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.093
"I live for the day
that we can be together.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.795
Love, Jon."

09:54.828 --> 09:56.196
Romantic.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.265
( laughs )

09:58.298 --> 09:59.399
( sniffing )

09:59.432 --> 10:00.868
Flowers are fresh.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.870
And he delivered them himself.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.905
How do you know that?
The florists put

10:04.938 --> 10:06.139
their insignia on their cards.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.274
This card is blank.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.710
Don't you ever get flowers?

10:09.743 --> 10:10.944
( laughs )

10:10.978 --> 10:13.213
Don't like gifts
that require attention.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.786
These are all bills
from before she left.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.921
Where are the letters?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.656
You think she trashed them?

10:22.690 --> 10:23.957
She never got them.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.059
She's been at sea
for the past two months.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.061
Right. So, yesterday,

10:28.095 --> 10:30.297
she should have returned home
to a stack of mail.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.666
She did what people do
when they take a trip.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.934
She had her mail stopped.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.739
TONY:
Where have you been?

10:38.772 --> 10:40.741
I missed lunch, so

10:40.774 --> 10:43.010
I decided to go out
for a snack. Why?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.412
We're heading to
the USS Monroe.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.413
I set up an interview

10:46.446 --> 10:49.049
with Petty Officer
Jordan's former rack mate.

10:51.819 --> 10:52.853
Can I have two minutes to eat?

10:52.886 --> 10:54.788
You get anything for me?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.089
No. I had a few dollars.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.791
Then there's no time.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.829
No food in the truck.

11:01.862 --> 11:02.896
What?!

11:02.930 --> 11:04.131
Gibbs' rules, not mine.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.169
On second thought,

11:09.202 --> 11:11.972
I think the rule
is that there's no
eating in Autopsy.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.707
The truck's okay.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.881
TONY:
Why are you breathing like that?

11:20.914 --> 11:21.882
What's wrong with you?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.016
I'm not feeling so hot.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.017
I don't like boats.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.853
It's not a boat,
it's a ship.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.020
And it's docked.

11:27.054 --> 11:27.955
Doesn't matter.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.156
As soon as I get
on the water,

11:29.189 --> 11:31.358
I immediately start
feeling queasy.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.726
Well, that's not
a good trait

11:32.760 --> 11:34.227
for someone
who investigates the Navy.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.798
Oh. I'm
feeling dizzy.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.499
Well, it's a good thing
you didn't eat that burger.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.801
Could've been embarrassing.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.007
I can't believe
this happened, sir.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.443
She was such a great person.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.812
Do you know of anyone

11:51.845 --> 11:53.513
that may have been angry
with Tiffany?

11:53.546 --> 11:54.982
Not at all.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.449
Tiff was friends with everyone.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.885
( inhaling )

11:57.918 --> 11:59.052
We all loved her.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.387
( exhales )

12:00.420 --> 12:02.923
Sir, are you sure you're okay?

12:02.956 --> 12:03.924
Oh, yeah. No.

12:03.957 --> 12:04.925
I-I just haven't

12:04.958 --> 12:06.359
gotten my sea legs yet.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.861
Can I get you anything?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.062
Some Dramamine maybe?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.064
Well, I already took six.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.065
( clears throat )

12:12.099 --> 12:14.367
You know what, I'll be fine.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.469
Don't worry about me.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.371
( sniffles )

12:18.405 --> 12:20.007
Had Tiffany been sick?

12:20.040 --> 12:23.076
I don't think so. Why?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.913
It appears she may
have been vomiting
when she was attacked.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.080
( garbled radio transmission )

12:27.114 --> 12:30.050
( sighs )

12:30.083 --> 12:32.085
Is there something
we should know?

12:32.119 --> 12:33.553
( laughs )

12:33.586 --> 12:35.288
MAN:
Yeah, it's hot...

12:35.322 --> 12:37.390
She came to me
about a month ago

12:37.424 --> 12:39.392
and said there was something

12:39.426 --> 12:41.962
that could potentially ruin

12:41.995 --> 12:43.997
her career in the Navy.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.838
What do we have, Duck?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.305
Well, no shortage
of water in her lungs.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.540
She definitely
drowned.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.942
Any internal damage?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.143
Yeah, her esophagus

12:56.176 --> 12:57.410
is quite worn,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.179
as if she'd been
vomiting excessively.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.380
Was she bulimic?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.849
Possible,

13:01.882 --> 13:03.083
but not probable.
Her throat shows

13:03.116 --> 13:06.386
little evidence
of self-regurgitation.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.956
Preliminary tests conclude

13:08.989 --> 13:10.958
that her bout
with hyperemesis was caused

13:10.991 --> 13:14.127
by a hormonal imbalance.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.262
Particularly, a drastic

13:15.295 --> 13:18.298
rise in her estrogen level.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.435
Morning sickness?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.871
Indeed.

13:23.904 --> 13:27.140
Our young exhibitionist
was pregnant.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.083
It's Petty Officer
Tiffany Jordan.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.986
J-O-R-D-A-N.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.254
No, I was just on hold!

13:41.288 --> 13:42.522
A warrant will take days.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.291
I need her mail now.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.193
Well, I understand
that it's Federal.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.361
That's not soon enough!

13:48.395 --> 13:50.630
Is the ocean view
partial or panoramic?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.365
Oh, sweet!
MAN ( on phone ):
Oh, yeah.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.967
And the bar's in the lobby?
MAN:
Yup.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.869
Yeah! That sounds great.

13:55.903 --> 13:56.904
( Tony laughs )

13:56.937 --> 13:58.371
Oh, yeah.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.040
All right. Yeah, I'll talk
to you soon.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.241
Thank you. Thanks.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.145
We're working;
you're planning a vacation.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.513
Oh, it's not just a vacation.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.215
Kate,

14:08.248 --> 14:10.317
it's spring break.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.919
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.254
No.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.655
Talked to my frat brothers
last night,

14:15.688 --> 14:17.090
just booked the hotel today.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.258
The wheels

14:18.291 --> 14:19.326
on the party bus

14:19.359 --> 14:20.527
are now in motion.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.329
Let me guess--
Panama City.
Oh, yeah.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.364
Palm trees, mai tais

14:24.397 --> 14:26.934
and coeds all week long, Probie.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.035
KATE:
Don't you think

14:28.068 --> 14:29.937
you're just a little
old for spring break?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.939
I can bong a beer
in under six seconds.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.941
Believe me, I'll fit right in.

14:33.974 --> 14:38.211
GIBBS:
Abby didn't find any foreign
prints on the bouquet

14:38.245 --> 14:40.313
or the beach bag,
and that means

14:40.347 --> 14:42.482
one of you had better give me
a lead.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.917
DiNozzo,

14:43.951 --> 14:45.085
start with you.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.353
I talked
to Petty Officer Jordan's

14:46.386 --> 14:47.354
rack mate from Monroe.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.922
She said Jordan bought an early

14:48.956 --> 14:50.457
pregnancy test
during a brief stop

14:50.490 --> 14:52.425
at King's Bay.
Well, she knew
she was pregnant.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.660
Any idea about the father?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.195
She used a pay phone
to call him,

14:55.228 --> 14:56.363
but his cell was turned off.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.597
She said she left a message.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.432
( laughs ):
That's your worst
nightmare, Tony.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.433
How's it going

15:00.467 --> 15:01.434
with those letters, Kate?

15:01.468 --> 15:02.269
I'm working on it.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.470
Thanks, Tony.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.104
How long?

15:04.137 --> 15:08.275
Uh, two days; three, tops.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.309
You got four.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.277
Really?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.278
Hours.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.046
Sounds about right.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.181
McGee.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.150
Are you

15:17.184 --> 15:19.019
waiting for me to announce you?

15:19.052 --> 15:20.187
No. I'm sorry.
I, uh...

15:20.220 --> 15:21.321
I pulled the
phone records

15:21.354 --> 15:23.390
from Petty Officer Jordan's
apartment.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.025
Uh, only one call
since she returned.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.193
It was yesterday

15:26.226 --> 15:28.128
at 1100 to a Lisa Kerr.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.998
Two hours prior to Ducky's
estimated time of death.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.732
This address her work
or her home?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.467
Uh, both. She's an at-home
yoga instructor.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.204
Good job, McGee.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.172
DiNozzo,

15:39.206 --> 15:40.073
you're with me.
Yeah!

15:40.107 --> 15:41.308
Right behind you, boss.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.343
Three hours,
58 minutes.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.356
Doctor, can you come here
for a second?

15:56.389 --> 15:57.724
What is it, Mr. Palmer?

15:57.757 --> 15:59.726
I am not sure.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.129
What do you think?

16:02.162 --> 16:05.432
Well, it looks like some sort
of paraffin wax.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.600
Yeah, it... it-it reminds me
of a product

16:07.634 --> 16:09.602
my grandfather used to use.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.005
He put a little of it
on either end of his mustache.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.174
Gave him the handlebar look.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.043
Well, that doesn't
make sense.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.577
Well, it was well
before your time.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.512
Back then, it was
a very popular look.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.482
Yeah, it epitomized
high society.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.118
No, no, not-not about
your grandfather.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.155
Why would she
have this stuff
in her hair?

16:28.188 --> 16:31.091
Well, I would surmise
it was on the killer's hands.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.326
Get it up to Abby right away.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.032
Thanks for having
me come along, boss.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.633
I know when it
comes to women,

16:40.667 --> 16:43.002
sometimes I get
a little distracted.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.273
I just want to let you know

16:46.306 --> 16:48.575
that I appreciate this vote
of confidence.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.047
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm not gonna let you down.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.682
I'm going to be attentive
and meticulous

16:55.715 --> 16:57.584
to every detail
in my notes.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.419
Oblivious to any distraction.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.524
We're here.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.364
( gentle grunting )

17:12.465 --> 17:14.567
( grunting, seagulls cheeping )

17:17.504 --> 17:18.605
GIBBS:
DiNozzo!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.509
Oh, yeah.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.511
I'm with you, boss.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.247
( clears throat )

17:27.280 --> 17:28.581
DiNozzo,

17:28.615 --> 17:29.616
your PDA.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.452
Right.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.156
Here it is, got it.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.126
Sorry about that.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.328
It's not a great
start, huh, boss?

17:41.361 --> 17:42.695
Could have been better.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.863
Sorry.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.232
( beeping )

17:45.265 --> 17:46.599
WOMAN:
Extend your arms.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.869
And try to get
your forehead

17:49.902 --> 17:51.171
to the ground.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.306
Nice long stretch.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.209
Let the head just hang...

17:56.243 --> 17:57.477
Lisa Kerr?
...to the ground.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.580
Yes.

18:00.613 --> 18:04.117
Hi. Special Agent Gibbs,
NCIS.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.186
Special Agent DiNozzo.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.520
We have a few
questions for you.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.489
Of course, yeah.
Uh, Sally?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.891
Yeah.
Can you just take over
the class for a second?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.726
Thanks.
Oh, sure, sure.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.495
I don't know if
it's hit me yet.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.364
You were close?

18:17.397 --> 18:19.166
As close as you can be
to a girl in the Navy.

18:19.199 --> 18:19.966
I mean she was here

18:19.999 --> 18:21.368
for one month
and gone the next.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.702
How'd you meet?

18:22.735 --> 18:24.904
She signed up
for my tantric yoga class

18:24.937 --> 18:26.606
a little over a year ago.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.840
It combines physical fitness

18:27.874 --> 18:30.243
with the ability
to heighten a woman's pleasure

18:30.277 --> 18:31.611
during prolonged lovemaking.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.380
( loud beeping )

18:35.515 --> 18:37.584
I'll reboot.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.619
( beeping )

18:39.652 --> 18:41.721
Who was Tiffany romantically
involved with?

18:41.754 --> 18:43.923
Never known her to date anyone.
In fact,

18:43.956 --> 18:45.458
she was the only
one in the class

18:45.492 --> 18:46.793
who was there for
physical fitness.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.895
She wanted to lose ten pounds
for her shoot.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.263
Shoot?

18:50.297 --> 18:51.464
Yeah, she was doing a spread

18:51.498 --> 18:52.565
with two other girls for GSM.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.633
It was called, um,

18:53.666 --> 18:55.302
"Naughty in the Navy."

18:55.335 --> 18:57.304
Hit stands
a couple months ago.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.571
I remember that issue.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.173
It was a good layout.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.575
What is GSM?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.611
Get Sum Magazine.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.547
It's like Playboy,
but less risqué.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.950
They both have
really great articles.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.253
( seabirds calling )

19:13.286 --> 19:14.587
The Navy respond?

19:14.621 --> 19:17.190
Oh, it was revealing,
but it wasn't nude,

19:17.224 --> 19:18.758
so she got a slap
on the wrist.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.227
I got a copy of it inside.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.561
Do you guys want to see it?

19:21.594 --> 19:22.529
That won't
be necessary.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.696
Why... won't it?

19:23.730 --> 19:26.233
I make a point of keeping
all of my copies.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.369
Like I said,
great articles.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.538
Tiffany called
you yesterday.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.606
Yeah, she said that
she was back in town,

19:33.640 --> 19:35.608
and that she wanted
to see me that night,

19:35.642 --> 19:36.876
and she needed to talk to me.

19:36.909 --> 19:37.844
About what?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.546
Never said.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.947
MAN:
Hey, Lisa.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.881
Hey.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.383
How was it?

19:43.416 --> 19:45.618
Ah, it was all blown out.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.554
Not a wave worth
paddling after.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.655
Hmm.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.258
KERR:
Should have gone with me
for the a.m. sets.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.692
The waves were overhead
and clean all morning.

19:52.725 --> 19:53.793
( laughs )

19:53.826 --> 19:56.229
They're from NCIS.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.964
Guys, this is my fiancé,
Kevin Holt.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.332
Hey.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.733
Hey.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.569
So, any suspects yet?

20:02.602 --> 20:04.404
We're working on it.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.505
Hmm.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.708
Girl gets murdered in public
during a bikini contest.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.910
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be pretty simple.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.413
You'd think.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.981
( seabirds crying )

20:17.484 --> 20:19.552
We're finished here.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.727
WOMAN:
Up arm...

20:27.760 --> 20:30.330
What is this stuff?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.431
Bikini glue.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.632
The contestants use it

20:32.665 --> 20:34.767
to keep their suit
bottoms from riding up.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.935
Really?

20:35.968 --> 20:37.304
Yup.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.838
I used to go through sticks
of that stuff

20:38.871 --> 20:40.239
when I was on the circuit.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.978
There's so much you
don't know, McGee.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.615
Is this what Jimmy found
in her hair?

20:48.648 --> 20:49.516
No.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.651
I compared both substances.
The stuff

20:51.684 --> 20:52.652
in her hair
is thicker.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.321
It's more like a wax.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.489
How's Kate
doing on time?

20:57.557 --> 20:58.791
Down to eight minutes.

20:58.825 --> 20:59.359
KATE:
Seven.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.294
Your watch must be slow.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.562
Kate, you made it!

21:02.595 --> 21:04.697
What's this?

21:04.731 --> 21:05.698
Uh, don't ask.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.733
So, how'd you do it?

21:06.766 --> 21:07.900
Did I ever tell you
about that Feeb in mail fraud

21:07.934 --> 21:09.669
that's always flirting with me?

21:09.702 --> 21:10.303
Yeah.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.003
I called him.

21:11.037 --> 21:11.971
You didn't say
you'd go out

21:12.004 --> 21:12.972
with him, did you?

21:13.005 --> 21:13.973
( laughs ):
Not exactly.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.008
I read him Section 22 Dash A

21:16.042 --> 21:17.944
of the Federal Government's
sexual harassment code.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.612
And then I told him
I needed a favor.

21:19.646 --> 21:20.547
Right on.

21:20.580 --> 21:20.980
I've never seen

21:21.013 --> 21:22.515
so much crap.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.717
This is why I've liberated
myself from paper mail.

21:24.751 --> 21:25.785
Why does that not surprise me?

21:25.818 --> 21:27.520
I don't even have a mailbox.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.855
If it doesn't come
electronically,

21:28.888 --> 21:29.889
I am not getting it.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.491
Okay, we'll each take a third

21:31.524 --> 21:32.258
and filter through it.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.794
I love it when
you're rough, McGee.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.765
TONY:
Huh. I knew she looked familiar!

21:38.798 --> 21:40.099
GIBBS:
Who?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.369
Lisa Kerr. She's the daughter
of Mister Kerr.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.604
You know,
from Mr. Kerr's Cupcakes.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.038
Oh, yeah. Well, that
explains the house.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.674
And she's in all
of the commercials.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.808
And it was driving me crazy,

21:48.841 --> 21:49.942
'cause I was trying
to figure out

21:49.976 --> 21:50.977
where I knew her from.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.512
Why don't you just ask her?

21:52.545 --> 21:54.481
I was kind of afraid to.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.648
Why?

21:55.682 --> 21:57.750
Well...

21:57.784 --> 21:59.686
I've had a lot
of short-lived relationships,

21:59.719 --> 22:02.622
and I kind of have a hard time
remembering all of them.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.957
I have the same problem
with ex-wives.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.527
The name's
Jonathan Redding.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.095
He's written our
victim four letters

22:09.128 --> 22:10.430
in the last six weeks.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.498
And the writing
indicates

22:11.531 --> 22:12.699
classic stalker.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.367
If he can't have her,
no one can.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.835
He sounds like our guy.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.670
We have a return address?

22:17.704 --> 22:18.638
Cellblock F.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.507
He's in the Danville
Correctional Facility.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.843
It can't
ever be easy.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.778
Well, I-I still think
we should talk to him.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.680
I mean, we can't just
ignore evidence like this.

22:27.714 --> 22:28.848
What evidence?

22:28.881 --> 22:29.882
The guy's still in prison.

22:29.916 --> 22:30.783
Not anymore.

22:30.817 --> 22:31.918
I just spoke

22:31.951 --> 22:33.420
to Danville's
assistant warden.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.455
Jonathan Redding was paroled
13 days ago.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.630
Jonathan Redding was arrested

22:43.663 --> 22:45.832
for assault and battery
in May of '01.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.568
He had two priors before that--
violation of a restraining order

22:48.601 --> 22:51.838
and possession of narcotics.
Two of his three arrests

22:51.871 --> 22:53.806
involved ex-girlfriends.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.943
We locate him?
I, uh, phoned his
registered address.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.712
They claim they
haven't seen him.
His parole officer?

22:59.746 --> 23:02.014
Phoned him, as well.
Still waiting to hear back.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.950
I'm gonna... call him again.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.085
This guy definitely
fits the profile.
!
All we have is

23:06.118 --> 23:07.920
a rap sheet
and some fan mail.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.889
Even if we find him,
we can't detain him.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.891
That may not be true, boss.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.860
Redding's former
cell mate saw the
murder on the news.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.962
He says he has
some information
we should hear.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.196
In exchange for what?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.031
Depending on what he gives us,
the D.A. may cut him a deal.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.635
Take Todd.

23:22.669 --> 23:23.903
Find out
what he knows.

23:23.936 --> 23:24.904
You got it.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.939
Kate, with me!

23:28.140 --> 23:30.142
( security door buzzing )

23:33.546 --> 23:35.782
You ever interrogate
a prisoner, Kate?

23:35.815 --> 23:39.452
Yes, Tony. I've been
at this for a while now.

23:39.486 --> 23:42.555
Well, it's important to
remember you can never
let your guard down.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.924
An inmate, unlike
a civilian, has
nothing to lose.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.159
Yeah, but this inmate,
Tony, asked to speak to us.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.394
Wants to do
the right thing.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.464
He's a felon, and that's the
way we're going to treat him.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.665
MAN:
Open the gate!

23:52.699 --> 23:53.933
( buzzing )

23:55.635 --> 23:57.470
TONY:
How long were you
and Jonathan Redding

23:57.504 --> 23:58.738
cell mates?

23:58.771 --> 24:00.607
Six or seven months.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.776
Which is it, Luke?
Six or seven?

24:03.810 --> 24:07.046
What's with the third degree?
I'm trying to help you guys.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.815
( man speaking indistinctly
over P.A. )

24:08.848 --> 24:11.183
Then answer the question.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.621
Well, he came in
right around my birthday, so...

24:14.654 --> 24:16.889
I guess it was closer to seven.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.190
Hmm.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.494
TONY:
So, you gave him the magazine
with Tiffany's picture.

24:21.528 --> 24:24.631
When was it that you started
to believe that Jonathan was...

24:26.699 --> 24:28.668
You're an Alpha
Chi Delta?

24:28.701 --> 24:30.202
Rutgers.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.671
'91.

24:40.747 --> 24:43.049
Ohio State. '89.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.016
No way!

24:44.050 --> 24:44.984
Yeah, dude!

24:45.017 --> 24:46.686
Are you in touch with

24:46.719 --> 24:48.154
any of the brothers?
Try to.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.889
You know, these days
it's not that easy.

24:49.922 --> 24:50.890
Oh, yeah.
You?

24:50.923 --> 24:52.224
Well, I'm still best friends

24:52.258 --> 24:54.627
with three of the guys
from my pledge class.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.296
In fact, we're heading down
to Florida for spring break!

24:57.329 --> 24:59.231
Aw, that's
awesome, man.
!
Yeah, yeah...

24:59.265 --> 25:01.834
Oh, I used to love spring break.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.069
Panama City!

25:03.102 --> 25:03.970
Ooh!

25:04.003 --> 25:05.705
Palm trees...

25:05.738 --> 25:08.140
Nope, that's all for now.
Thanks very much.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.578
Boss, located Redding.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.746
He is working at the
Water Wheel Car Wash.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.548
It's only two miles
away from where

25:15.582 --> 25:17.550
Petty Officer Jordan
was attacked.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.552
We should've had him
three hours ago.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.721
I'm sorry about that.
I-I kept hitting dead ends.

25:21.754 --> 25:22.855
Learn to anticipate, McGee.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.057
Anticipate?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.125
Always think a step ahead.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.927
Shouldn't have to
ever waste time

25:27.960 --> 25:29.028
deciding what to do next.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.029
( phone rings )

25:30.062 --> 25:32.031
Anticipate...

25:32.064 --> 25:33.733
Yeah. Gibbs.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.167
KATE:
According to his cell mate,

25:35.201 --> 25:36.936
Redding...
( chuckling )

25:36.969 --> 25:39.606
...stared at Petty
Officer Jordan's photos
for hours at a time.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.873
TONY:
No, I'm in the bedroom...

25:40.907 --> 25:42.108
And then the letters started.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.175
You think he was obsessed?

25:43.209 --> 25:44.844
Oh, yeah.
He found her address

25:44.877 --> 25:46.212
over the Internet
and said his plan was

25:46.245 --> 25:47.880
to contact her
when he was released.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.181
He didn't want to live
without her.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.117
Or her to live without him.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.652
McGee track down an address?

25:52.685 --> 25:54.687
Yeah. We're on our way.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.189
Hey, McGee, get the...

25:57.223 --> 25:58.324
Keys to the car.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.292
( whispers ):
Keys to the car.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.096
( hip-hop song playing )

26:21.013 --> 26:22.715
We're a little out
of place here, McGee.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.717
Feels like high school.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.354
What the hell is that?

26:28.387 --> 26:30.156
McGEE:
Believe it's an Escalade, boss.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.924
The wheels, McGee.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.026
Oh, uh, the rims.
They're called
"spinners."

26:34.060 --> 26:35.027
What's the point?

26:35.061 --> 26:37.630
It's a hip-hop thing.

26:37.664 --> 26:40.066
The more I know,
the less I understand.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.067
Afternoon, gentlemen.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.401
Your sedan looks like
it could use

26:42.434 --> 26:43.269
a... wash.

26:43.302 --> 26:46.138
We're looking for
Jonathan Redding.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.840
I'm Rodney, Jon's supervisor.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.308
Something I can help you with?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.310
Yeah, you can point
him out to us.

26:55.214 --> 26:58.217
He's right over there.
I've got him driving today.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.389
Jon do something wrong?

27:07.226 --> 27:08.828
Jonathan Redding!

27:12.064 --> 27:14.433
Stop! Federal Agents!

27:14.466 --> 27:16.903
Where's he going?!

27:18.204 --> 27:20.272
Whoa!

27:22.909 --> 27:26.679
( grunting )

27:26.713 --> 27:27.780
Redding!

27:29.481 --> 27:31.684
Redding!

27:35.287 --> 27:37.289
Redding! Stop!

27:40.827 --> 27:43.963
( mechanical clanging )

27:49.368 --> 27:50.770
Anticipate, McGee.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.912
Luke was right.
This dude is creepy.

27:59.946 --> 28:03.182
Do you realize you've
been talking about
Luke since we left?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.984
He's a good guy.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.118
He's a criminal, Tony.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.254
And you have a
man-crush on him.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.956
I do not have a man-crush.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.424
I just feel bad for the guy,
that's all.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.160
Well, I just
don't understand

28:14.193 --> 28:16.929
what it is about men
and their fraternity.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.265
It's like this pact

28:19.298 --> 28:21.133
to get drunk and laid
supersedes everything.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.936
Okay, getting drunk and laid
is only, like, 90% of it.

28:23.970 --> 28:26.973
And the rest is
brotherhood and solidarity.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.241
Well, if you ask me,
it's as juvenile

28:29.275 --> 28:30.109
as spring break.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.311
You ever been on
spring break, Kate?

28:32.344 --> 28:33.813
Yes, I have, Tony.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.147
Panama City, junior year.

28:37.316 --> 28:40.386
my friends and I
conducted ourselves
with complete dignity.

28:40.419 --> 28:41.253
Sounds like a blast.

28:43.856 --> 28:47.293
Finally. I've been sitting
here 20 minutes.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.329
I'm sorry, Jon.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.298
I asked them
to put out refreshments,

28:52.331 --> 28:54.000
and they must've forgotten.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.337
Why am I here?

28:58.370 --> 29:00.907
Because killing
people is illegal.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.241
I didn't kill anyone.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.243
Then why did you run?

29:04.276 --> 29:07.847
'Cause I owed the wrong people
a lot of money when I went away.

29:10.282 --> 29:11.818
Drugs?

29:15.321 --> 29:18.224
And now that I'm out,
they're looking to collect.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.392
I saw you two guys coming at me,
and I reacted.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.329
He's lying.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.097
Well, if he is,
he's pretty good.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.066
REDDING:
I didn't know what else to do.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.335
We just wanted
to talk to you, Jon.
Yeah?

29:29.368 --> 29:31.804
Hi. What'd I miss?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.207
Who dressed you?
( snickers )

29:35.241 --> 29:39.812
Look, I chased this joker
through the car wash, all right?

29:39.846 --> 29:41.247
( stifled laugh )
( chortles )

29:42.414 --> 29:43.382
What?

29:43.415 --> 29:44.183
We came straight here.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.918
This is all I had
that was clean.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.320
Your gym clothes were clean?

29:48.354 --> 29:51.223
Well, who would have guessed?

29:51.257 --> 29:53.492
( stifled chuckle )

29:53.525 --> 29:54.994
( snorts )

30:01.467 --> 30:03.135
Where'd you get this?

30:03.169 --> 30:05.371
Same place I got
the other three--

30:05.404 --> 30:08.007
Petty Officer Jordan's P.O. Box.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.276
She never got them?

30:10.309 --> 30:11.343
That why you killed her?

30:11.377 --> 30:13.145
Because she wouldn't respond
to you?

30:13.179 --> 30:15.147
I didn't kill her.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.448
I loved her.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.417
Where were you

30:18.450 --> 30:19.986
Saturday between 12:00

30:20.019 --> 30:21.387
and 1:15 p.m.?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.355
I was there.
I was at the contest.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.358
You're not helping your
cause much here, Johnny boy...

30:26.392 --> 30:28.427
I went there because
I wanted to talk to her,

30:28.460 --> 30:30.362
tell her how much
she means to me!

30:30.396 --> 30:32.531
Why didn't you tell her that
when you delivered the flowers?

30:32.564 --> 30:36.568
'Cause she wasn't home.
So, I left them at the door.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.370
I didn't see her
at the contest, either.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.039
I waited, but she
never came out.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.307
Did you go by yourself?

30:41.340 --> 30:44.043
( chuckles )

30:44.076 --> 30:46.312
Yep.

30:46.345 --> 30:50.282
I showed up about
a half-hour before it started.

30:50.316 --> 30:53.285
I stood right in front of
the stage until it was over.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.323
I didn't kill her.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.460
I just wanted to be
a part of her life.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.432
( sighs )

31:06.465 --> 31:08.867
You have to believe me.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.642
What's the problem, Abbs?

31:16.675 --> 31:18.477
( sighs )
I'm not really sure.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.512
The picture was crystal clear
when I tested it.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.582
There we go.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.917
What happened?

31:24.951 --> 31:26.252
Tony forgot to rewind.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.386
Thanks, Abbs.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.387
You already watched this?

31:28.420 --> 31:29.255
I glanced at it.

31:29.288 --> 31:30.156
He took it home.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.491
What is wrong with you?!
It's like you have

31:32.524 --> 31:33.459
some sort of a sickness.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.361
I had a hunch there might be
something on it.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.129
Yeah, like ten half-naked women.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.364
Cue it up from the beginning.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.333
Got it. It was
a two-camera shoot.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.236
One was on the stage
and the other was on the crowd,

31:44.270 --> 31:45.404
for reactions.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.006
Fast-forward to around noon.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.609
Stop.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.211
Zoom in on "B."

31:53.379 --> 31:55.214
That's him, right there.
Keep running it.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.184
He's where he said he was.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.519
Yeah, but he still has
until 1:15 to slip away.

32:00.552 --> 32:01.620
Speed it up, Abbs.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.460
McGEE:
It's past 1:15, boss.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.429
He's telling the truth.

32:10.462 --> 32:15.567
Jonathan Redding did not kill
Petty Officer Jordan.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.475
Where's Gibbs?
I don't know,

32:23.509 --> 32:25.644
but we do report to him,
remember?

32:25.677 --> 32:27.713
I think I found us a lead.
Where?

32:31.217 --> 32:34.186
( sighs ):
Honestly, Tony, you need help.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.722
You'll sing a different tune
when I show this to Gibbs.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.657
Show me what?

32:38.690 --> 32:42.694
I was thumbing through
Petty Officer Jordan's layout,

32:42.728 --> 32:44.430
and I found something
I thought you should see.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.067
These two photos
weren't taken by the magazine.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.002
They got them
from her.
Why?

32:50.036 --> 32:52.004
It's something
GSM likes to do.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.705
Gives the reader
a voyeuristic look

32:53.739 --> 32:55.274
into the girls' lives.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.076
Who do you think
took the photos?
Probie,

32:57.109 --> 32:58.610
back it up a little bit.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.845
Sorry.
In the article,

32:59.878 --> 33:02.614
Petty Officer Jordan said they
were taken by her boyfriend.

33:02.648 --> 33:03.782
I thought she didn't date.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.351
Well, she was
pregnant, McGee,

33:05.384 --> 33:07.519
and there's only one
way th can happen.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.021
Did you contact GSM?

33:09.055 --> 33:10.256
I did. They said
that the photos

33:10.289 --> 33:11.590
were taken by a
local photographer

33:11.623 --> 33:13.192
named Jason Kaplan--
he's a freelancer

33:13.225 --> 33:14.260
they work with a lot.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.427
Check it out.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.728
Okay. Don't worry, boss,

33:16.762 --> 33:17.696
I'll keep it professional.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.631
Yep, I know you will,

33:19.665 --> 33:21.500
because Kate's going with you.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.735
I am?

33:23.769 --> 33:26.105
It seems like an in-and-out job,

33:26.138 --> 33:27.706
( chuckles ):
boss. Um...

33:27.739 --> 33:30.109
Are you sure that
that's really necessary?

33:31.543 --> 33:33.712
He's sure.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.617
This guy has the life--
he spends all day

33:38.650 --> 33:40.486
photographing the
world's hottest women.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.255
I'm sure his mom is proud.
What's that
supposed to mean?

33:43.289 --> 33:44.456
Those pictures
are demeaning.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.092
They make women
look like sex objects.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.094
You need to loosen up--
the human body's

33:48.127 --> 33:50.796
a beautiful thing;
it should be admired.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.498
( disgusted groan )

33:52.531 --> 33:53.799
You're right, Tony.

33:53.832 --> 33:57.136
The human body
is a beautiful thing.

33:57.169 --> 34:00.139
*

34:11.183 --> 34:12.584
Gorgeous. Don't
move an inch.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.254
I feel nauseous.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.157
Great. Okay, guys,
let's take a five.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.558
Todd, you want to make sure

34:19.591 --> 34:20.759
to keep them oiled up?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.161
Sorry to keep
you waiting,

34:22.194 --> 34:24.730
but I didn't want to, uh...
break the zone.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.232
I take it this isn't

34:26.265 --> 34:27.666
for GSM.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.601
No. No. This is
for Sports Monthly.

34:29.635 --> 34:32.604
You're looking at three members
of the U.S. Water Polo Team.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.640
Ah, great uniforms.

34:34.673 --> 34:38.277
Is there anywhere else
that we could talk?

34:38.310 --> 34:39.645
I guess we could
talk in my office.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.413
That'd be great.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.819
Tiffany Jordan.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.788
I couldn't believe
when I saw her on the news.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.691
Such a cute girl.
Camera really loved her.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.426
We were wondering about
the two small photos

34:54.460 --> 34:55.627
at the bottom
of her layout.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.463
Article said they were
taken by her boyfriend.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.697
That's between her
and the magazine.

34:58.730 --> 34:59.831
My job is just to send in
the pictures

34:59.865 --> 35:01.367
and get consent
from whoever took 'em.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.335
Do you have that
release on file?

35:03.369 --> 35:05.371
Sure. Yeah. I keep records
of everything.

35:05.404 --> 35:08.240
Personally, I find
it insulting

35:08.274 --> 35:11.510
that magazines publish
amateur photos.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.846
I spent four years in
photography classes.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.382
It took me months

35:16.415 --> 35:18.184
to get published.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.323
Kevin Holt is
Lisa Kerr's fiancé.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.892
Why would he have
any reason

35:26.925 --> 35:29.261
to photograph Tiffany
in the bedroom?

35:29.295 --> 35:31.830
Lisa might be wondering
the same thing.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.253
GIBBS:
Hey, what do you have, Ab?

35:54.286 --> 35:57.589
A serious hatred of wax.
I think you look

35:57.623 --> 35:58.890
stressed.
I compared
our victim's

35:58.924 --> 36:00.592
wax to over a hundred
different products,

36:00.626 --> 36:01.627
each just one molecule

36:01.660 --> 36:03.195
different than the next.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.264
Do you know how small
a molecule is?

36:05.297 --> 36:06.265
I do.
Shut up, McGee.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.266
I really like

36:07.299 --> 36:07.933
this new Abby.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.335
And after many
fun-packed

36:09.368 --> 36:11.837
hours of nothing but wax,
I found a match.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.739
KATE:
Does that say "sex wax"?

36:13.772 --> 36:14.940
That it does--
it comes in

36:14.973 --> 36:15.974
cool, warm and tropical.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.277
How does it work?
Don't worry about
it, Probie.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.212
I'm pretty sure you
still need a girl first.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.447
ABBY:
It's not like that.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.948
Mister Zog's Sex Wax
is a brand name.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.316
It's made for surfers.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.217
Surfers?
Yeah-- they put it

36:25.251 --> 36:27.419
on their boards to
help with traction.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.524
( seagull cries )

36:34.593 --> 36:36.362
GIBBS:
Hello, Kevin.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.664
Ah, my friends from NCIS.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.965
What do you know, boys?

36:39.998 --> 36:41.833
More than you'd
like us to.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.536
( chuckles ):
Come again?

36:44.570 --> 36:47.373
We know about your
relationship with
Tiffany Jordan.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.640
What relationship?

36:48.674 --> 36:50.776
Her and Lisa were friends--
I barely knew her.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.878
Yeah, well...
you knew her well enough

36:52.911 --> 36:54.580
to take intimate photos of her.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.615
Do you do that with
all of Lisa's friends?

36:56.648 --> 36:59.918
Your lighting
needed work.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.755
Look, fellas,
it's not what you think.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.492
'Kay? Her and I, we hung out
a couple of times, you know?

37:06.525 --> 37:07.859
It was totally innocent.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.628
She asked me to help
take some photos

37:09.661 --> 37:12.398
for this magazine,
so I helped her out.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.766
Generous of you.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.271
Lisa know about the photos?

37:19.305 --> 37:23.309
No. No, she didn't even know
that Tiffany and I were friends.

37:23.342 --> 37:27.813
Well, nothing going on,
why the big secret?

37:27.846 --> 37:30.682
( clears throat ):
Look, Lisa's...

37:30.716 --> 37:33.051
very insecure.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.387
'Kay? I come home from
a weekend surf tournament,

37:35.421 --> 37:37.923
she'd smell my
clothes for perfume.

37:37.956 --> 37:41.327
I even caught her going through
my e-mail a couple of times.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.861
Look at that, boss,
she's suffocating him,

37:42.894 --> 37:44.496
and all he's doing
is taking lingerie shots

37:44.530 --> 37:45.564
of her girlfriends.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.499
It's not what you think.

37:47.533 --> 37:50.502
I-I wasn't sleeping
with Tiffany.

37:50.536 --> 37:54.406
Good. Then you won't mind
submitting a DNA sample.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.310
Why?

37:58.344 --> 38:00.379
Wait, you have
the killer's DNA?

38:02.414 --> 38:03.382
All right, fine.
You know what?

38:03.415 --> 38:04.516
You want me
to take your test,

38:04.550 --> 38:05.784
I'll take your test.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.419
I got nothing to hide.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.323
ABBY:
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!

38:11.357 --> 38:12.824
We have a winner!

38:12.858 --> 38:14.059
Tony, tell us
what he's won.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.762
Well, Abby, he's won
an all-expenses-paid

38:16.795 --> 38:19.531
iron vacation to
sunny Leavenworth.

38:19.565 --> 38:20.999
Keep your day job.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.033
May not be an option.

38:22.067 --> 38:22.901
What about his prints?

38:22.934 --> 38:25.003
ABBY:
I compared them to the prints

38:25.036 --> 38:26.405
that Tony and McGee got from

38:26.438 --> 38:27.906
the beach restroom,
they didn't jive.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.075
We must've lifted
hundreds of prints.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.109
You sure you
ran them all?

38:31.142 --> 38:32.811
No, McGee, about midway through,

38:32.844 --> 38:34.480
I got tired, so I
just like, "Screw it."

38:34.513 --> 38:37.115
Just thought I'd check.
TONY:
Okay, so he didn't leave

38:37.148 --> 38:39.751
any prints-- all that
proves is that he's more
careful at a crime scene

38:39.785 --> 38:41.453
than he is in the bedroom.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.693
I agreed to take a test.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.894
I didn't agree to spend

38:48.927 --> 38:51.597
the whole night
in this tiny room.

38:51.630 --> 38:55.100
This is a luxury suite
compared to what you're
looking at.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.735
What are you talking about?

38:57.803 --> 39:00.038
( quietly ):
You lied to us, Kev.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.610
KEVIN:
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.111
I didn't lie to you
about anything.

39:06.144 --> 39:08.146
TONY:
You told us
that you and Tiffany...

39:08.179 --> 39:09.715
What's going on?

39:09.748 --> 39:11.517
What is Kevin
still doing here?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.051
Evidence leads us to believe

39:13.084 --> 39:14.986
he was involved
in Tiffany's murder.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.455
Oh, no, that's ridiculous.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.690
He's not capable
of killing anyone.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.826
TONY:
I got good news
and I got bad news.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.128
Which do you want
to hear first?

39:23.161 --> 39:24.663
Tiffany was pregnant...

39:24.696 --> 39:26.064
and there is

39:26.097 --> 39:29.100
a 99.98% probability

39:29.134 --> 39:31.136
that you are the father.

39:33.472 --> 39:34.840
Tiff was pregnant?

39:34.873 --> 39:37.008
I decided to go
with the bad news.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.410
He...

39:38.444 --> 39:40.479
KEVIN:
I had no idea.
He cheated on me?

39:40.512 --> 39:43.181
I can't believe
he cheated on me.

39:43.214 --> 39:47.052
I... I've given
him everything.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.554
You never suspected?

39:48.587 --> 39:53.158
Why wou I?
She's my friend.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.160
It'll be okay.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.596
Get her a glass
of water, McGee.
You bet.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.499
I still don't believe
he killed her.

40:02.468 --> 40:03.769
KEVIN:
I thought you said

40:03.802 --> 40:05.003
there was some good news.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.773
Right, I almost forgot--
there is a, uh, .02%...

40:07.806 --> 40:12.043
chance that you're
gonna walk out of here.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.781
Hey, look, I... I screwed up,
okay, I admit that,

40:15.814 --> 40:18.517
but I am not a killer.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.720
The-the-the last time
that I saw Tiff

40:21.753 --> 40:23.154
was right before we left,

40:23.188 --> 40:25.223
and we both decided
that we'd end it then.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.992
You're not a very
reputable guy, Kev.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.193
Why should we believe you?

40:28.226 --> 40:29.060
Because I'm telling you
the truth.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.529
TONY:
You didn't have anything to do

40:30.562 --> 40:31.497
with this, why'd you avoid us?

40:31.530 --> 40:33.131
What are you talking about?
I-I never avoid...

40:33.164 --> 40:34.600
We've been calling you
for two days.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.468
I left four messages
on your cell phone.

40:36.502 --> 40:37.268
He's lying.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.870
He never left him
any messages.

40:38.904 --> 40:41.439
How do you know?

40:53.218 --> 40:55.954
Sure you don't want
to call your lawyer?

40:55.987 --> 40:58.056
I didn't do anything wrong.

40:58.089 --> 41:01.593
I just...
want to get this over with.

41:05.664 --> 41:09.234
It must've been a shock when
you heard Tiffany's message.

41:11.937 --> 41:15.507
No one would blame
you for being angry.

41:15.541 --> 41:17.576
I didn't listen
to any message.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.546
Okay? I wouldn't invade
Kevin's privacy like that.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.914
You didn't have any problem
searching through his e-mail.

41:22.948 --> 41:25.083
He told you that?

41:30.589 --> 41:33.825
We lifted your
fingerprint from
this glass.

41:33.859 --> 41:37.796
It matches a print we found
a few feet from Tiffany's body.

41:45.270 --> 41:49.107
I think I'd like
to call my lawyer now.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.544
I think that's probably a...

41:52.578 --> 41:54.980
a good idea.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.583
( Tony whistling a tune )

42:00.018 --> 42:01.319
( Kate sighs )

42:01.352 --> 42:03.622
I thought you were leaving.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.857
I'm on my way.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.960
See you next week.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.629
Try not to embarrass
yourself, Tony.

42:10.662 --> 42:13.999
Come on, Kate,
I'm way too grown-up for that.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.734
( loud party usic playing )

42:15.767 --> 42:19.204
CROWD:
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

42:19.237 --> 42:21.607
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

42:21.640 --> 42:23.274
( cheering )

42:23.308 --> 42:26.712
( Tony laughs )
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

42:26.745 --> 42:28.880
( whoops )

42:28.914 --> 42:30.749
You're pretty.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.017
You're pretty.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.351
I'm pretty.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.621
I'm going to the head.

42:35.654 --> 42:38.156
( chuckles )

42:39.791 --> 42:41.126
( chuckles )

42:42.928 --> 42:46.231
( laughing ):
I love this place.

42:46.264 --> 42:49.300
Ah... yeah.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.639
Ah...

42:54.840 --> 42:56.642
Ah.

42:58.844 --> 43:02.848
( loud laughter )

43:02.881 --> 43:04.182
( laughter echoing )
