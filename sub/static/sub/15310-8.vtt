WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:05.539
Jim, you didn't have to
get me all liquored up,

00:05.573 --> 00:08.042
all right? I prescribe
Zerplexa all the time.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.311
And everyone at
LifeBio Pharmaceuticals

00:10.344 --> 00:12.680
appreciates your
support, Dr. Stokes.

00:12.713 --> 00:13.747
Oh,

00:13.781 --> 00:16.350
hey, hey...

00:16.384 --> 00:17.751
Zerplexa pens.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.220
Oh!

00:19.253 --> 00:20.088
All right.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.522
This completes
my collection.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.092
Now I have everything
from Adazol to Zerplexa.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.261
Let me ask you something:
have you ever crushed up

00:27.295 --> 00:30.531
some of those Zerplexa
pills and snorted 'em?

00:30.564 --> 00:31.932
No.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.367
Joking, I'm joking.

00:33.401 --> 00:36.003
That is no laughing matter.
I got to go.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
I got to go.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.543
Nice pen.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.745
Best part of being a doctor.

00:44.778 --> 00:45.879
Really?
No, actually,

00:45.913 --> 00:47.181
then there's the, uh,

00:47.215 --> 00:49.183
part when you meet
a hot woman at a bar

00:49.217 --> 00:51.685
and you get to tell her
you're a doctor.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.686
I'm a doctor.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.123
I'm Gretchen.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.800
Last night
was amazing.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.242
You had sex
with a senior citizen?

01:15.243 --> 01:19.447
Oh, what a delicious,
undoable mistake.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.216
How'd this happen?

01:22.250 --> 01:23.917
I'd had too much to drink,
it was dimly lit,

01:23.951 --> 01:25.953
and her makeup was Oscar-worthy.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.621
Will, it sounds like
you strapped on a pair

01:27.655 --> 01:30.724
of beer goggles and ran straight
into that cougar cage.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.961
I just want to forget this
whole thing ever happened.
Oh, come on,

01:33.994 --> 01:35.263
what's the big deal?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.630
So you did a little...

01:36.664 --> 01:38.766
antiquing over the weekend.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.302
Oh, you might want
to check the mirror,

01:41.335 --> 01:42.770
you got a little gray curly

01:42.803 --> 01:44.438
stuck between your teeth.

01:59.853 --> 02:00.988
Okay, are you
people ready?

02:01.021 --> 02:02.590
Ah, there's my date.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.925
Wow, you look
absolutely adequate.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.728
You look like
a Kmart mannequin.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.264
I can't believe you guys are

02:10.298 --> 02:11.865
going through with this
whole fake date thing.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.867
Oh, I'm going through with it,
because knowing Linda Altman,

02:13.901 --> 02:15.436
she is only
getting married

02:15.469 --> 02:18.138
so that I'm the last
single one from our sorority.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.274
Or she's
actually in love.

02:20.308 --> 02:23.110
She'll do anything
to stick it to me.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.945
Well, I will not
give her the satisfaction

02:24.978 --> 02:26.614
of showing up alone.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.349
All right, first things first:
did you bring the Laker tickets?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.950
You will get the tickets
after the wedding,

02:29.983 --> 02:31.151
that was the agreement.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.820
Now let's go over
our story. We met in?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.322
St. Barts.
First dinner?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.657
Fish tacos.
And then we walked
on the beach and...?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.126
Don't make me say it.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.229
Courtside, Will.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.364
I looked in your eyes
and felt a connection

02:43.397 --> 02:46.133
unlike any I had before;
it was magic.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.837
Wow, you two crazy kids
may just fake make it.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.307
So, first weekend
away from Charlie, huh?

02:53.341 --> 02:54.808
Beautiful
Santa Barbara,

02:54.842 --> 02:56.577
nice hotel room.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.480
Too bad you're too pregnant
to actually have any fun.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.981
We're gonna have
plenty of fun.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.182
We're gonna
sleep in late,

03:02.216 --> 03:03.517
we're gonna
order room service

03:03.551 --> 03:08.155
and knock out some
medium-hot sex.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.392
Is that even, like,
physically possible?

03:11.425 --> 03:13.193
According to this book,
How to Have Sex

03:13.227 --> 03:15.095
When You're Super
Pregnant, yes.
Oh.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.266
Oh. Ah, my mom is

03:18.299 --> 03:20.401
two minutes away.
Great.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.571
Soon as we hear her broom
pull up, we'll hit the road.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.944
You guys,

03:30.978 --> 03:32.946
wasn't the ceremony
just so stunning?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.849
Meh.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.351
This must have
cost a fortune.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.787
I am so glad Lowell
and I have been saving.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.189
Well, just think-- the next
wedding we'll be at is yours.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.724
I know.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.192
And most importantly,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.194
I'll be skinny by then.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.899
What's with the squealing?
Why do they squeal?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.267
'Cause it's
a wedding.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.304
Women love romance. It's
like emotional porn.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.971
Hey, speaking of romance,

03:58.005 --> 04:00.140
don't say anything
to Jules, but...

04:00.173 --> 04:02.109
I'm going to surprise her
with a couple of tickets

04:02.142 --> 04:03.711
to India tonight.
I'm taking her back

04:03.744 --> 04:05.245
to the place we first met.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.147
I once surprised Andi
with some new underwear

04:07.180 --> 04:09.049
before our agreed-upon
six-month deadline.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.751
Blew her mind.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.154
But yours is good, too.
Yeah.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.056
Oop. Got a text.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.725
Room's ready. Excuse me.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.460
Okay, just got a text.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.928
They brought our
bags up to the room.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.563
They even upgraded us
to a handicapped suite,

04:22.596 --> 04:24.898
so you can get in and
out of the tub easier.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.400
Nice.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.135
All right,
let's go do it.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.603
What, right now?
Yeah,

04:29.637 --> 04:31.271
I figure we have 20 minutes
before the girl comes back

04:31.305 --> 04:34.308
with the crab cakes,
so let's go.
Okay.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.977
Katie.
Linda.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.012
Mwah, mwah.
Mwah, mwah.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.648
So glad you
could make it.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.451
I thought you'd be alone,
so I put you at the table

04:43.484 --> 04:45.619
with all the cool
single ladies.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.590
Yeah, I RSVP'd plus one.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.593
I know, but with you it's always
here today, gone tomorrow.

04:54.027 --> 04:58.298
Anyhey, I want you to
meet my eternal plus-one,

04:58.332 --> 05:01.369
the love of my
life, Michael.
Pleasure to meet you.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.770
You may
recognize him

05:02.803 --> 05:06.306
from the altar where
he said "I do."

05:06.340 --> 05:08.942
Oh. And I
would like you to meet

05:08.976 --> 05:11.111
the love of my life,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.881
and a doctor,
Dr. Will Stokes.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.215
Hi. Will.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.351
Kate and I met
in St. Barts over fish tacos.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.687
We are very much in love.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.392
So, what does Michael do?
Does Michael save lives?

05:24.425 --> 05:27.294
He's in commercial real estate.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.963
I own a Taco Bell.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.132
So, saving lives,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.368
peddling tacos.

05:34.402 --> 05:37.204
Whoa!

05:37.237 --> 05:38.739
Let's go.

05:40.908 --> 05:45.012
Oh, your being a doctor
finally means something.

05:45.045 --> 05:48.582
Now get off.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.984
You know what I'm
thinking about right now?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.019
What?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.954
My mother.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.590
Bye, boner.

05:56.624 --> 06:01.261
I just wonder how she's
doing with Charlie, you know?

06:01.294 --> 06:02.896
I miss him.

06:04.064 --> 06:07.367
Hang on, we'll do it
right after I call my mother.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.704
Don't cross those wires.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.875
I believe this
belongs to you.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.410
Oh, my God.

06:16.444 --> 06:19.046
What are the chances of
meeting two nights ago in L.A.

06:19.079 --> 06:23.116
and then here tonight at a
wedding in Santa Barbara?

06:23.150 --> 06:26.286
Slim to none.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.955
And yet here you are.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.757
What happened to you?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.959
I got out of the shower,
heard the door close,

06:31.992 --> 06:35.228
and then feet running
lightly down the hallway.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.798
Sprinting, actually.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.068
Yeah, about that.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.070
I'm sorry, I...

06:43.103 --> 06:44.538
The tr... The truth is...

06:44.572 --> 06:47.207
I have a girlfriend.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.642
I-I have a girlfriend,
and we'd broken up,

06:48.676 --> 06:50.878
but then I got a text
from her that morning,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.981
and I-I knew if I stayed, I
wouldn't be able to resist you.

06:54.014 --> 06:59.152
You're the irresistible one.
My God, that tongue of yours.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.957
I felt like I'd been
through a car wash.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.394
This girlfriend, uh,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.897
is it serious?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.899
Very serious.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.601
Too bad,

07:13.634 --> 07:15.736
because this could have
really been something

07:15.769 --> 07:17.437
if not for the
girlfriend.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.340
If not for the
girlfriend, yeah.

07:20.373 --> 07:23.443
Oh, well, life is cruel.
Gotta go.

07:24.945 --> 07:25.746
Wait,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.581
you bought
tickets to India?

07:27.615 --> 07:29.249
Surprise. I was gonna wait to
tell you,

07:29.282 --> 07:30.450
and then I thought,

07:30.484 --> 07:33.153
romantic occasion,
romantic gesture.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.923
Lowell, that is
a lot of money,

07:35.956 --> 07:36.924
and I thought we agreed

07:36.957 --> 07:38.325
we were gonna save
for the wedding.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.793
Well, yeah,
but, babe,

07:39.827 --> 07:41.829
imagine riding an
elephant to a waterfall

07:41.862 --> 07:45.633
and then making love
in that waterfall.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.537
Or... imagine
having a wedding

07:49.570 --> 07:51.772
in a room
with guests

07:51.805 --> 07:53.674
and a caterer.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.545
Okay.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.147
I've gotta say, that's
not the reaction
I was expecting.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.883
So what do you
want me to do?

08:02.916 --> 08:04.618
Just... do you want me
to return the tickets

08:04.652 --> 08:06.286
and just forget about the
romance, the elephant,

08:06.319 --> 08:07.655
and the sex waterfall?

08:07.688 --> 08:10.824
Thank you for not
making me say it.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.660
You're the best.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.968
So, did he pick his monkey
pajamas or his truck pajamas?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.737
Rocket ships?

08:23.771 --> 08:24.538
I did not

08:24.572 --> 08:25.806
see that coming.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.007
He didn't go with
his regular pajamas.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.244
And then what did he do?

08:31.278 --> 08:32.479
Aw!

08:32.512 --> 08:33.480
And then what
did he do after that?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.849
And did he
do anything...?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.719
Hi.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.253
I'm Michael's friend, Simon.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.322
I couldn't help
but notice you...

08:42.355 --> 08:44.491
sneering at the bride.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.160
Oh, no, see,
that was, um...

08:47.194 --> 08:48.662
I swallowed
an Altoid.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.564
Personally, I think Michael's
making a huge mistake.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.865
I loathe her.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.200
I'm Kate.
Hi.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.035
Why don't I get
you a drink?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.604
A... vodka martini?

08:56.637 --> 08:57.705
How did you know?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.172
I can smell it
on your breath.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.409
I'll go get
his attention.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.578
Hi. Uh...

09:04.612 --> 09:06.113
I got a little bit
of a situation.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.815
I need you to go with me.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.550
The old lady?
Gretchen?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.085
She's here.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.455
Well, that is
an unfortunate

09:15.488 --> 09:18.058
but enjoyable-for-me
coincidence.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.392
I told her
I was in

09:19.426 --> 09:21.094
a serious relationship
with you, so...

09:21.128 --> 09:22.095
lay one on me.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.864
Oh, God...

09:23.897 --> 09:26.199
Look, you served your purpose
with Linda Altman

09:26.233 --> 09:27.200
and I'm very grateful,

09:27.234 --> 09:28.702
but I just met a cute guy,

09:28.736 --> 09:31.805
so now our fake relationship
is broken up for real.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.074
Hey, I was there
when you needed me.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.710
For Lakers tickets.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.411
Don't cloud
the issue.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.980
We met in St. Barts.
We ate fish tacos.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.649
That's the story
we're sticking with,
so get on board.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.216
Uh, hi, I'm Simon.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.384
Who are you?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.787
No one. Get lost!

09:55.428 --> 09:56.997
Okay, I'm sorry
about that.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.732
I guess being away from
Charlie for the first time

09:58.766 --> 09:59.967
was a little harder
than I thought.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.334
Will you hold this
for a second?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.636
Sure.
Anyway,
I promise

10:02.670 --> 10:03.570
I am not going
to talk to my mom

10:03.603 --> 10:04.504
on the phone
anymore.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.939
Really?
Mm-mm.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.775
Because she
and Charlie

10:07.808 --> 10:09.576
are on their
way over here.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.111
I booked them
an adjoining room.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.980
Great.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.447
So now I'm paying
for two hotel rooms

10:14.481 --> 10:15.816
I'm not going
to have sex in.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.617
Why don't we just go home
after the wedding?

10:17.651 --> 10:18.686
No, we can't.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.920
My mom's
super excited

10:19.953 --> 10:21.588
for a weekend
in Santa Barbara.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.190
She'd be
super excited

10:23.223 --> 10:24.424
for a weekend
in Afghanistan

10:24.457 --> 10:26.059
if she knew it'd
make me unhappy.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.097
Whew.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.532
Oh.

10:32.565 --> 10:33.867
Well, look at that.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.436
Seated at the
same table.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.540
Again, what are
the chances?

10:40.573 --> 10:42.776
Again, slim to none.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.612
You know what I love
about this wedding?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.981
The bread sticks.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.787
Uh, there she is--
my... my girlfriend Kate!

10:53.821 --> 10:56.223
There you are, girlfriend Kate!

10:56.256 --> 10:59.126
Please, help. I am mildly
terrified of this woman.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.627
So, go home.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.062
I can't. You're my ride.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.496
Well, that is
unfortunate for you,

11:03.530 --> 11:05.298
because I am staying
a very long time.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.800
I'm going to go dance
with Simon.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.635
No, you don't.
If you dance with Simon,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.237
it negates our
relationship.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.339
We have no relationship.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.506
I'm not letting you go.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.475
Well, then,
you leave me no choice.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.643
Will, it's over.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.411
I'm moving on,
and you should, too!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.647
Uh... but I love you!

11:20.680 --> 11:22.850
I hate you.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.690
This time, it's your turn
to go through the car wash.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.527
Cheers!

11:34.561 --> 11:36.029
Yeah, to your
smoking hot wife.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.731
So far,
marriage has been awesome.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.667
My life is gonna be
so much more fun from now on!

11:45.305 --> 11:46.673
What?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.608
I was right where you are
on my wedding day.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.910
Where are you now?

11:49.943 --> 11:51.078
Well, seven years in,
marriage just isn't

11:51.111 --> 11:52.679
exactly what I
thought it would be.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.914
Oh, yeah? What is it?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.348
Well, it's the triumph

11:55.382 --> 11:58.518
of responsibility
over spontaneity, no over yes.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.088
I mean, sure, you can try to
have a little fun on the fly--

12:01.121 --> 12:04.792
a last hurrah-- but the kids,
the wife, the mother-in-law--

12:04.825 --> 12:06.126
they always win.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.361
One day, you wake up,
and you're just a man

12:08.395 --> 12:12.565
with two hotel rooms,
no sex life and a purse.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.635
Come on, let's go hit
on some drunk chicks.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.005
Dude, I just got married.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.715
Lowell just told Jules that
he's having second thoughts.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.083
Part of me feels terrible.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.551
The other part of me feels like,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.887
wow, somebody actually
listens to me.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.388
Bobby, Jules is
really upset.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.790
You've got to go
talk to Lowell.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.258
You've got to go
make this right.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.593
Okay. Can you at least
hold your purse while I go?

12:40.627 --> 12:43.163
No. I got to go
get more food.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.335
Excuse me, Miss?

12:48.368 --> 12:52.439
This ginger ale is from
the gentleman over there.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.980
Weddings, huh?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.116
You alone?

13:03.150 --> 13:04.918
Apparently.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.187
A pretty lady should
never be alone.

13:07.220 --> 13:11.591
Hi. I'm Brandon Schwartz of
the Woodland Hills Schwartzes.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.961
Ooh.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.199
Tall stool.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.471
What is on your
mind right now?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.908
Old spiders?

13:40.253 --> 13:42.022
Hey.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.892
I've been looking for you.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.798
You got to talk
to Jules, Lowell.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.033
Yeah? And say what?

13:53.066 --> 13:56.403
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.804
I didn't mean it.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.906
You look skinny.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.207
You know, all
the greatest hits.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.042
Is that what marriage
is all about?

14:02.075 --> 14:04.644
Just telling 'em what
they want to hear?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.046
Pretty much.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.814
You know, it's just
the old Jules--

14:07.847 --> 14:09.649
she would have chosen
waterfalls and elephants

14:09.682 --> 14:11.818
over saving for a
wedding. I'm just...

14:11.851 --> 14:13.653
I'm worried
she's changing.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.155
Well, you guys
are getting married.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.190
Of course she's gonna change.
You both will.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.093
Yeah, but I don't want to,
and no offense, Bob,

14:20.127 --> 14:21.661
but I don't want your life.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.030
Okay, you're afraid
of your wife,

14:23.063 --> 14:24.831
you bought a book
on how to have sex,

14:24.864 --> 14:27.200
and you're dancing
with a purse.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.838
And then he tells me
we're going to India,

14:31.871 --> 14:34.007
like, out of the blue!

14:34.041 --> 14:36.443
So, he just bought the tickets?
Who does that?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.211
Right?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.213
I mean, if we're
gonna be married,

14:40.247 --> 14:42.749
we have to make these
decisions together.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.684
I don't know.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.420
It just seems like
it shouldn't be this hard.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.090
Okay, let's
take it wide.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.391
You know what I really
hate about people?

14:51.424 --> 14:53.026
When you say, "Hi.
How are you?" and...

14:53.060 --> 14:54.794
And they actually
tell you how they are!

14:54.827 --> 14:57.197
You're supposed to just say,
"Good. I'm good."

14:57.230 --> 14:59.032
Yeah. It's an
unwritten rule!
Yeah.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.201
Okay, you know what
the absolute worst is for me?
Tell me.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.736
When you get on a plane, and the
person sitting next to you...

15:03.770 --> 15:06.940
Strikes up a conversation.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.710
I feel flush.

15:15.248 --> 15:19.052
Ugh! What is
wrong with him?

15:19.086 --> 15:20.420
What?

15:20.453 --> 15:23.323
Nothing. Sorry. Not
my problem. Continue.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.725
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.396
Will you excuse me?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.798
I just have a potential
catastrophe to deal with.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.733
Um, just wait here, okay?
Yeah, okay.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.968
You know what else
I hate about people?

15:35.002 --> 15:36.469
When they can't
hold their liquor.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.271
Will! Get over here!

15:38.305 --> 15:39.639
Kate.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.075
Wow, you
look great.
Ugh!

15:42.109 --> 15:44.411
Will, you cannot sleep
with this woman again.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.645
Why... Why not?

15:45.678 --> 15:48.448
Because, you take a car out
once, it's a test drive.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.017
Twice, it's a lease.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.251
And can you really see yourself

15:51.284 --> 15:53.753
in a Gretchen
for the next three years?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.588
I am waiting,

15:55.622 --> 15:57.757
Willie.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.762
Hey!

16:02.795 --> 16:03.963
I want you back.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.299
I want to give us
a second chance, so,

16:06.333 --> 16:08.168
sorry, you're out.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.470
You said we were done!

16:10.503 --> 16:12.039
Hey!

16:12.072 --> 16:14.374
Does this feel like we're done?

16:15.575 --> 16:20.180
The good ones are always
either gay or dating a skank.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.055
That was a
cold shower.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.023
You're welcome.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.059
Now, if you'll excuse me...

16:32.825 --> 16:35.095
Simon?

16:41.068 --> 16:43.036
Did you eat my cake?

16:43.070 --> 16:46.005
Did you talk to Lowell?

16:46.039 --> 16:48.641
The answer to both
questions is yes.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.477
And?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.646
And he still has cold feet.
I'm sorry.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.315
Well, thank you for trying.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.650
I guess they're just gonna have
to figure it out for themselves.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.053
I'm also sorry for what I said
about marriage.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.254
No, I don't care about that.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.689
I complain about you
all the time.

17:02.722 --> 17:03.756
You do?

17:03.790 --> 17:05.192
Oh, yeah! To the pool guy,

17:05.225 --> 17:06.659
to you while you're sleeping,
to the FedEx guy,

17:06.693 --> 17:08.495
to the guy that comes
and reads the gas meter.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.198
I think I got it.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.000
Honey, venting is a very
important part of marriage.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.535
You know, the resentment--
it just...

17:15.568 --> 17:17.036
It needs somewhere to go.

17:17.070 --> 17:20.173
It's like you can't have
a fireplace without the chimney.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.175
Speaking of things
that fly up the chimney,

17:22.209 --> 17:23.443
where's your mother?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.512
Well, Charlie fell asleep
in their room,

17:25.545 --> 17:28.115
so she's in ours
watching Pay-Per-View.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.949
Well, as long as she found a way

17:29.982 --> 17:32.852
to spend more of my money,
I'm happy.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.687
Want to dance?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.589
Sure.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.024
Oh, no.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.026
This is gonna be a
two-hand job, buddy.
Okay, ready?

17:40.059 --> 17:43.062
Three, two, one.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.538
You're welcome.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.540
Thank you.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.075
Now go away.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.446
You know what else
I hate?

17:59.479 --> 18:02.115
When you see a girl you like
kissing some guy,

18:02.149 --> 18:03.550
and it really bums you out

18:03.583 --> 18:04.917
because you don't know
the whole story until that guy--

18:04.951 --> 18:06.119
who turns out to just be
her friend-- explains...

18:06.153 --> 18:07.720
You know what I hate?

18:07.754 --> 18:11.758
When I'm waiting too long for
the guy I like to kiss me.

18:21.168 --> 18:25.138
Oy, when are they gonna
throw the bouquet?

18:33.045 --> 18:36.216
Well, hello there.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.919
Dr. Will Stokes.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.921
I'm a doctor.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.291
Such a pleasure.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.794
The pleasure... is all mine.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.131
A doctor, huh?

18:54.301 --> 18:58.271
Well, I'm sorry that I ruined
our romantic time together.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.472
Ah, you didn't ruin it.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.174
We can have it right here
right now.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.449
My water just broke.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.619
Oh, my God,
we're gonna have a baby.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.988
Why is the
floor all wet?

19:16.022 --> 19:17.690
Somebody needs to
come clean this up...

19:21.261 --> 19:23.563
Best night ever.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.773
Yeah, let him in.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.581
Is that her?

19:42.282 --> 19:45.252
No, Will. That's a loaner.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.053
She's so beautiful.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.757
I usually find babies gross,
but this one...

19:50.790 --> 19:53.760
This one's okay.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.328
You want to hold her?

19:55.362 --> 19:59.432
Oh, no, I'll just take her out
for drinks when she's 16.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.706
God, she's...
a miracle.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.877
I want to get married, and
I want us to have a baby.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.347
Oh, and I also
want to make up.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.549
We should probably
do that first.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.887
Um... I'm so sorry.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.221
What about all the stuff

20:22.255 --> 20:25.191
you said about spontaneity
and responsibility?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.959
Well, I've just
spontaneously realized

20:26.993 --> 20:28.728
I want to be responsible.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.297
Really?

20:30.330 --> 20:34.701
If it means having that
with you, then, yeah,

20:34.734 --> 20:36.936
really.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.576
And how about we go
to India for our honeymoon?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.945
How about we make
our life a honeymoon?

20:45.978 --> 20:47.314
Totally. Our marriage
doesn't have
