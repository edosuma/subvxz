00:13.747 --> 00:16.716
We rock! We rock!

00:16.783 --> 00:18.774
<i>I am outta here!</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:57.182
Dear Sara.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.351
Thanks for being so special.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.089
Toodles!

01:03.163 --> 01:05.096
Fiona.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.190
- So my mom took away my iPod.
- No way.

01:07.267 --> 01:10.395
Can you believe it? For a whole month.
I don't know how I'm gonna live without it.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.404
- Rachel?
- But you still have your Blackberry, right?

01:12.472 --> 01:14.565
<i>- Yeah.
- Rachel?</i>

01:14.641 --> 01:16.734
Do you think you could sign
my yearbook?

01:18.278 --> 01:21.406
- Don't have a pen. Sorry.
- Right.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.915
I can't believe she just asked me that.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.543
- Thanks, Fiona.
- Have a super summer.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.610
Next.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.324
Aubry?
Could you sign my yearbook?

01:32.392 --> 01:34.952
Oh, I'll have to get
back to you on that.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.292
Right.

01:37.363 --> 01:40.992
Uh, Sara, could you please
just give me a mercy signing?

01:41.067 --> 01:43.058
Fine.

01:44.637 --> 01:48.073
- Who are you?
- Moondance Alexander.

01:48.141 --> 01:50.769
- What grade are you in?
- Ninth.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.335
I'm just really short.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.110
Thank you.
Well, have a good summer.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.175
See you later.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.925
<i>Oh, there's Fiona.</i>

02:05.992 --> 02:08.392
- Hey, girls.
- Hey.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.622
Megan, my gum is stale.

02:10.697 --> 02:13.029
And... I'm supposed to do what?

02:13.099 --> 02:15.033
Duh! Kleenex.

02:15.101 --> 02:18.229
- Don't have one, Fiona.
- Don't look at me.

02:18.304 --> 02:22.365
- Hey, Moonwalk.
- Hi. Well, it-it's Moondance, actually.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.672
Whatever. Do you want me
to sign your yearbook?

02:24.744 --> 02:27.542
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.542
- Cute shirt, Moondance.
- Oh, totally.

02:31.618 --> 02:34.052
<i>- Thanks.
- Is it vintage?</i>

02:34.120 --> 02:36.520
<i>Um, I don't think so.
Why?</i>

02:36.589 --> 02:39.854
<i>I had one just like it...
when I was 12.</i>

02:39.926 --> 02:43.453
- There you go.
- Thanks.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.328
Hey, Josh. Did you sign
Moondance's yearbook?

02:46.399 --> 02:48.162
Um, no, not yet.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.533
- Oh, no.
- Oh! That's foul.

02:53.606 --> 02:56.404
What a freak!

03:00.813 --> 03:05.011
Hey, Moondance.
Is it true your middle name is Uranus?

03:05.084 --> 03:07.484
Hey, man!

03:09.355 --> 03:12.722
<i>#Can't hold on to the words #</i>

03:12.792 --> 03:16.888
<i># I seem to be so ordinary #</i>

03:16.963 --> 03:20.399
<i># Not like I've ever heard #</i>

03:20.466 --> 03:24.129
<i># It seems to be
the same old story #</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:27.662
<i># No more waiting patiently #</i>

03:27.740 --> 03:31.198
<i># For you to make
a fool of me #</i>

03:31.277 --> 03:34.075
<i># So I can't hold on #</i>

03:34.147 --> 03:39.779
<i># So I will finally walk away #</i>

03:39.852 --> 03:43.083
<i># And call it a day #</i>

03:47.594 --> 03:51.690
<i># And call it a day #</i>

03:55.034 --> 03:59.437
<i># Call it a day ##</i>

04:28.501 --> 04:31.231
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

04:31.304 --> 04:36.173
School's out today and I made
a complete idiot of myself again.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.536
I won't go into all the gory details,
but trust me.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.275
It was really horrific.

04:43.349 --> 04:46.580
And, in case you were wondering...

04:46.653 --> 04:50.521
my friend roster
is at an all-time low.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.616
I don't mean to complain.
It's just...

04:53.693 --> 04:57.561
you're the only one I can tell.

04:58.731 --> 05:02.292
Mom would only flip out
and try to fix it.

05:04.604 --> 05:09.837
She keeps saying that I'm different because
I'm destined for something special.

05:09.909 --> 05:13.072
Only wish I knew what
that something was.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.979
That way it could start happening.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.244
Like... now.

05:20.953 --> 05:24.013
Maybe you could put in
a rush order for me?

05:26.359 --> 05:29.328
Well-
I gotta go...

05:31.764 --> 05:34.927
but thanks for listening, Dad.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.663
You always make me feel better.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.363
I love you.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.623
- Hi.
- Hello.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.873
Hi, Mr. McClancy.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.576
<i>Oh, hello, Moondance.</i>

06:24.650 --> 06:27.585
Well, I see you got through
another year of school.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.918
Yes, thank goodness.
I don't think I could have lasted another day.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.323
Oh. Well, you've got
the whole summer ahead for fun.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.885
- You got any big plans?
- No.

06:36.963 --> 06:40.956
- I think I'm just gonna focus on my work.
- Your work?

06:41.033 --> 06:45.129
Well, that- that's good.
Well, I got a couple of deliveries here for you.

06:45.204 --> 06:47.297
<i>One of 'em goes to
your mama's studio.</i>

06:47.373 --> 06:50.399
And these are horse supplements
that, uh, go to this address.

06:50.476 --> 06:54.742
Now, it's on the edge of town, so I drew
a little map for you on the back of the receipt.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.748
<i>- Okay.
- And you can drop it off there.</i>

06:56.816 --> 06:59.614
If there's no one around,
you can just drop it in the mailbox, okay?

06:59.685 --> 07:02.085
Sounds good.
Thanks, Mr. McClancy.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.350
Yeah.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.415
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

07:06.492 --> 07:09.086
Let's see. Oh.

07:09.162 --> 07:13.496
Very... nice, Rose.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.262
But I'm still sensing
some anger in your work.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.803
I tried to soften the eyes a little.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.806
Yes, and that- and that helped.

07:21.874 --> 07:25.935
I would just love to see you
branch out a little.

07:26.012 --> 07:29.675
Maybe try a more uplifting
subject matter.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.683
I paint what I feel.

07:35.121 --> 07:39.558
Okay then.
Oh, Ben, that is really very nice.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.026
- Oh, uh, thank you, Gelsey.
- That was great choice of colors.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.029
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, hey, honey.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.071
I got your supplies.

07:46.072 --> 07:48.726
Hey, would you like to stay
for our visualization exercise?

07:48.801 --> 07:51.326
- The subject today is fruits of the garden.
- Uh, no, thanks.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.338
I think I know what
a tomato looks like.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.807
I still have another delivery to make,
but I will make sure I am home by dinner.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.208
Okay. Don't be late.
I'm making something special.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.405
<i>- Special?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:05.645
Miso-baked tofu
with Cambodian-style pineapple glaze.

08:05.718 --> 08:09.085
Cambodian pineapple?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.680
It sounds wonderful.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.021
It is.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.993
It really is.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.394
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna go.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.489
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.126
You know, with the sweet
and then the spicy...

08:23.202 --> 08:26.865
- it's just a really interesting combination.
- Yeah.

08:33.746 --> 08:37.238
<i>- Hi there.
- Hi, Moondance.</i>

09:01.774 --> 09:05.141
Hmm? Well, this must be the place.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.475
Hello?

09:43.549 --> 09:46.245
Who's there?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.344
Is anyone there?

10:45.444 --> 10:47.435
Hey there.

10:48.848 --> 10:52.875
You just about gave me
a heart attack.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.512
Where's your owner?

10:55.588 --> 10:57.579
Are you alone out here?

10:59.091 --> 11:02.185
You look like you
could use a good brushing.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.195
Or a bath.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.027
Or both.
Where do you live?

11:11.103 --> 11:14.004
Well, what am I supposed
to do with you?

11:14.073 --> 11:16.940
It's getting dark out.

11:17.009 --> 11:21.708
And I can't just leave you here
in the middle of the road.

11:24.483 --> 11:27.077
I think you're gonna
come home with me.

11:31.757 --> 11:35.386
It's okay.
I'm just gonna put this around you.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.452
Easy.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.563
You ready? Come on.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.627
Come on.

12:04.256 --> 12:06.156
- Mom.
- Yeah?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.159
- Stop cooking.
- Why? What's the matter?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.492
- I need you to come with me.
- Well, w-w-wait. Moondance.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.125
- Honey, where are we going?
- You'll see.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.863
Moondance, why are you
being so mysterious?

12:17.937 --> 12:20.735
Don't worry.
It's all good.

12:20.806 --> 12:23.969
- I hope it's all good.
- It is.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.273
- Ta-da!
- What am I looking at?

12:26.345 --> 12:29.178
- Well, he was just right here.
- Who was?

12:29.248 --> 12:31.808
- There you are.
- It's a horse!

12:31.884 --> 12:34.079
- It's a pinto.
- It's eating my organic apples!

12:34.153 --> 12:35.984
Can you believe it?
I found him.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.853
- What do you mean, you found him?
- Well, I was doing a delivery.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.858
You know, the one
right after I saw you.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.054
I was on this really creepy road and I thought
that somebody was following me.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.598
But then he jumped out and I thought
that he was a possible stalker.

12:46.665 --> 12:51.159
But he's a horse. You can obviously tell
that he's neglected and really hungry.

12:51.237 --> 12:54.070
So I couldn't just leave him
there in the middle of the road.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.836
Mom, I think he's homeless.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.969
Moondance, this horse is not homeless.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.240
He's gotten out somehow
and now he's lost.

13:02.314 --> 13:05.750
But we don't know that.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.718
Well, you know what?
We'll call Mr. McClancy.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.620
<i>I'm sure he can help us
find the owner. No!</i>

13:12.057 --> 13:14.491
Sorry, Mom.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.187
Ah.

13:18.097 --> 13:22.898
<i>Okay, Buck. Yeah, thank you very much.
I really appreciate all your help.</i>

13:22.968 --> 13:25.869
<i>We'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.</i>

13:25.938 --> 13:28.065
Mr. McClancy said that there are only
a few farms in that area.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.632
So he's gonna make some calls
and get back to us tomorrow.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.701
I never made my other delivery.

13:33.779 --> 13:37.613
You'll have to do it first thing in the morning,
after you find the horse's owner.

13:37.683 --> 13:41.141
- That stinks.
- Well, that's life.

13:41.220 --> 13:45.020
Why don't I finish dinner and you go say
good night to your temporary visitor?

13:45.090 --> 13:47.752
Oh, and whoa, whoa.
Here.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.695
- Give him this and tell him to lay off my art.
- Thanks, Mom.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.766
Hi there.
Oh, your forelock's all dirty.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.402
Want some apple?
Yeah.

14:05.477 --> 14:08.913
There you go.
You like that, don't you?

14:08.981 --> 14:11.176
I wonder who your owner is.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.778
Well, whoever they are,
they should be flogged, 'cause you're a mess!

14:15.855 --> 14:20.451
See, if I were your owner,
I would take really good care of you.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.792
And you know what else?
l- I would name you Checkers.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.458
I think you would like Checkers.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.162
Well, then, I think Checkers it is.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.171
My name is Moondance Alexander.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.289
<i>Whoa!</i>

15:05.638 --> 15:10.234
That was a little painful,
but fun. Yeah, old buddy?

15:10.309 --> 15:12.675
<i>- Moondance!
- Come on. Let's do it again.</i>

15:12.745 --> 15:17.239
Moondance! Young lady,
what do you think you're doing?

15:17.316 --> 15:19.682
Um, nothing. Just going
for a little workout.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.414
No, you're not!
Get down off that horse right now!

15:22.488 --> 15:24.979
- But, Mom, can't-
- Moondance Alexander, this is not your horse.

15:25.057 --> 15:28.151
Now get off.
I'm not gonna tell you again!

15:30.629 --> 15:31.795
Why are you freaking out?

15:31.796 --> 15:34.360
I just saw you flying through
the air like Wonder Woman.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.266
I mean, thank goodness you're not hurt.
You're not hurt, are you?

15:37.336 --> 15:40.430
- No!
- Look, honey, you don't know this horse.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.599
He-He could have
trampled you to death...

15:42.675 --> 15:46.509
and goodness knows whatever else
a wild animal like this is capable of.

15:46.578 --> 15:49.979
- Checkers isn't wild.
- Checkers?

15:50.049 --> 15:53.712
I-I named him... temporarily.

15:58.324 --> 16:01.953
<i>Mr. McClancy is here
to get the horse.</i>

16:02.027 --> 16:05.758
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- That's all right.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.425
I guess all good things
must come to an end.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.695
<i>No. Come on, Checkers.</i>

16:25.517 --> 16:27.451
Hi there.

16:27.519 --> 16:31.319
- Well, I take it, uh, this is the escape artist, huh?
- Yes, sir.

16:31.390 --> 16:35.258
Well, good thing you caught him.
No telling what kind of trouble he'd gotten into.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.522
Who's he belong to, Buck?

16:37.596 --> 16:39.496
A guy over at, uh,
Tumbleweed Stables.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.591
Would you mind if I went
with you to drop him off?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.863
I think you have that delivery
to make this morning.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.770
Oh, right.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. McClancy.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.867
Well, that's all right. You can make it
up to me if you help me load the horse.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.276
Yeah. I'd like that.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.242
<i>Come on, Checkers.</i>

17:04.690 --> 17:07.853
<i>- Well, that does it.
- Thanks again for everything, Buck.</i>

17:07.925 --> 17:11.362
No problem.
No problem at all.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.135
Bye, Checkers.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.971
Don't worry, honey. We'll find something fun
for you to do this summer.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.016
Sure, Mom.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.984
Whoa!

18:15.060 --> 18:17.790
Oh, well, this is just perfect.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.598
Tumbleweed Stables?
No way!

19:13.218 --> 19:15.812
Hello?
Is anyone here?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.857
Checkers?
How are you?

19:20.926 --> 19:23.190
They got you locked up, don't they?

19:23.262 --> 19:27.528
<i>Well, can't say that I blame them.</i>

19:27.599 --> 19:31.933
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Oh, um, I'm the one who-

19:32.004 --> 19:34.495
- Speak up.
- Well, l-m-I'm-

19:34.573 --> 19:36.837
- I'm trying.
- You're trespassing.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.707
You know that, don't you?

19:39.778 --> 19:42.110
I'm the one who found your horse.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.274
You found my horse?

19:44.349 --> 19:49.048
Yes, sir. Um, I was just coming by to check
and make sure that he's okay.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.521
He's fine.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.619
Right. Well...
I can see that.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.390
Can I ask you what his name is?

20:00.465 --> 20:04.868
- Tinkerbell.
- Tinkerbell? But... he's a boy.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.871
Mm-hmm.

20:08.640 --> 20:13.737
Well, I was wondering.
How did he get out?

20:13.812 --> 20:16.474
That's for me to worry about.

20:18.283 --> 20:22.310
Okay. I guess I'll be leaving then.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.093
Can I ask you just one more thing?

20:31.163 --> 20:32.653
What?

20:32.731 --> 20:35.165
Do you need any help
around this place?

20:35.234 --> 20:39.068
<i>- I mean, I was looking for a second summer job.
- I'm not hiring.</i>

20:39.137 --> 20:44.404
Right. Well, you don't
have to pay me.

20:44.476 --> 20:48.276
- How about a trade?
- What kind of trade?

20:50.816 --> 20:54.877
I could clean out the stalls
and feed the horses...

20:54.953 --> 20:59.686
and in exchange, you can
let me ride... Tinkerbell.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.022
What's your name?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.756
Moondance Alexander.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.866
Hmm. Good name.

21:10.869 --> 21:14.669
Thanks. Nobody's ever said that before.
Well, except my mother.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.872
I'm Dante Longpre.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.072
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Longpre.

21:22.147 --> 21:25.981
So, what do you say?
Is it a good trade?

21:26.051 --> 21:28.042
Sorry.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.019
Well, is- is that a "no"?

21:39.097 --> 21:44.364
<i>- I'm thinking.
- Right! No. You-You think.</i>

21:44.569 --> 21:47.060
Check that out.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.540
It was off the wall.
Loved it.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.669
<i>Nice pants.</i>

21:53.745 --> 21:56.737
You know, Moondance, we do have
this new thing called dry cleaning.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.251
- I had an accident.
- That's more than we needed to know.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.584
I'm just curious. Do you ever look in the mirror
before you leave the house in the morning?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.816
l- I never really thought about it.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.485
- You should try it sometime.
- Yeah, it's actually offensive...

22:08.560 --> 22:12.052
that we have to experience
your fashion disasters on a daily basis.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.325
Well, then- then don't look.

22:14.399 --> 22:17.596
- Like we have a choice.
- Whatever.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.899
Oh, my God.
That is such a great shot.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.940
Oh, my gosh.

22:27.813 --> 22:31.010
Oh, I gotta get this.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.643
Freddie, you're such an oaf!

22:33.719 --> 22:35.619
This is going straight
on the Internet.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.281
Hey! Megan, Fiona, check this out.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.993
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

22:46.064 --> 22:48.123
Well, it looks like you ate it.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.727
Yeah. It- It was really intense.

22:51.803 --> 22:55.398
- What happened?
- I hit a rock.

22:55.474 --> 22:59.638
- Oh.
- Yeah, guess it's really stupid, huh?

22:59.711 --> 23:03.477
Nah. You're bleeding.

23:03.548 --> 23:08.247
I am? Oh, yeah, I am, I guess.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.050
I got this skateboarding yesterday.

23:11.123 --> 23:15.617
- Oh, that looks like it really hurts.
- Ah, no biggie.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.492
Right.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.396
'Kay. Well, see you around.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.991
Yeah. I'll-

23:24.069 --> 23:27.232
<i>I'll see you, Josh.</i>

23:44.523 --> 23:47.117
<i>Well, what do we have here?</i>

23:49.161 --> 23:52.460
- Do you think you can fix it?
- Oh, I don't know.

23:52.531 --> 23:54.499
Looks pretty serious.

23:54.566 --> 23:57.262
- I think I can fix it.
- Thanks.

23:57.335 --> 24:00.634
I'm working on some really big plans for
this summer. So I need to be pretty mobile.

24:00.705 --> 24:03.139
- Oh, big, huh?
- Yeah.

24:03.208 --> 24:06.143
- There's just one more hurdle I have to get over.
- Well, what's that?

24:06.211 --> 24:08.941
- My mother.
- Oh.

24:09.181 --> 24:13.174
<i>Mom, I need you to put down your paintbrushes
and just breathe for a second.</i>

24:13.251 --> 24:15.719
Moondance, I have
a class in five minutes.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.881
Well, then clear your chi
or cleanse your chakra...

24:18.957 --> 24:22.324
or whatever it is that you have to do
to have a fresh perspective.

24:22.394 --> 24:25.192
Mom, please.

24:31.269 --> 24:33.737
Okay, I'm as ready as I can be
on such short notice.

24:33.805 --> 24:37.639
Okay. I'm going to clean stalls
and work around the barn for Mr. Longpre...

24:37.709 --> 24:41.304
and in exchange he's going
to let me ride Tinkerbell.

24:41.379 --> 24:45.042
I'm sorry. Can you run that by me again?
Who's Mr. Longpre?

24:45.116 --> 24:47.243
He's the owner
of Tumbleweed Stables.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.083
Well, what were you doing there? I thought
you had that delivery to make this morning.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.488
Yeah, and I did.
That's how I found the place.

24:53.558 --> 24:55.992
See, all I need is
to have your permission.

24:56.061 --> 24:59.724
- Who's Tinkerbell?
- That's Checkers.

24:59.798 --> 25:03.325
- Moondance.
- Mom, please. Think about it.

25:03.401 --> 25:05.494
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

25:05.570 --> 25:08.403
I mean, it'll help me build
valuable life skills.

25:08.473 --> 25:10.907
- Cleaning stalls?
- It'll help build my character.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.773
I think your character
is big enough.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.335
Oh, and it'll teach me humility.

25:15.413 --> 25:18.348
Oh, you know what?
You just stop quoting me.

25:18.416 --> 25:22.580
- What about your job with Mr. McClancy?
- Well, I can do both.

25:25.657 --> 25:30.526
Before I say anything,
I want to meet this Mr. Longpre.

25:30.595 --> 25:34.224
Great! Thank you.
We can go after your class. Thank you, Mom!

25:36.968 --> 25:38.902
So, Mr. Longpre...

25:38.970 --> 25:41.768
what exactly do you expect
from my daughter?

25:41.840 --> 25:43.056
Mom, I already told you-

25:43.057 --> 25:45.640
Excuse me. I would like to
hear it from Mr. Longpre.

25:45.710 --> 25:50.050
What time do you want
her to start in the morning?

25:50.051 --> 25:51.114
6:30, sharp.

25:51.182 --> 25:54.379
Did you hear that, Moondance?
She's really not a morning person.

25:54.452 --> 25:58.218
I am too.
Well, I will be for this.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.318
And I don't want any of
your noisy friends around here.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.331
- No problem there. Don't have any.
- Well, that's not true.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.833
<i>Yes, it is.
Mom, come on.</i>

26:09.901 --> 26:12.734
It's time that you face reality.

26:12.804 --> 26:15.830
Anyway, about her riding,
I really must insist that she wear a helmet.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.933
And I don't want her doing
anything crazy when no one's here.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.444
- Mom, I don't need a babysitter.
- And about that horse.

26:21.513 --> 26:24.038
Is there something you can do
to settle it down before she gets on it?

26:24.115 --> 26:27.084
The two of them were just tearing around
our yard like maniacs this morning.

26:27.152 --> 26:30.121
Look, I don't need
your daughter's help.

26:30.188 --> 26:33.248
<i>She came to me,
she asked for a fair trade.</i>

26:33.325 --> 26:37.523
I agreed. She works hard,
she gets to ride.

26:39.998 --> 26:43.195
And that's all I expect out of her.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.169
<i>Here.</i>

26:46.237 --> 26:48.330
You can borrow this.

26:51.543 --> 26:55.104
Well, um, great.

26:55.180 --> 26:58.343
That's-That's all I needed to know.

27:06.458 --> 27:10.451
Well, here you go. I thought I'd jazz up
our veggie burgers with soy cheese.

27:10.528 --> 27:13.053
What I would give for a Big Mac right now.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.565
Well, you used to let me eat them.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.626
<i>Well, that's before I saw Super Size Me.
Do you want some amino acid?</i>

27:18.703 --> 27:21.866
No, thanks. I'd rather die.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.637
You know, honey, you said something
today that... was a little upsetting.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.541
Yeah? What was that?

27:27.612 --> 27:30.080
That you don't have any friends.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.309
Oh. Yeah, that.

27:32.384 --> 27:36.218
Well, what happened to Mary Powell?
Did you guys have a falling out?

27:36.287 --> 27:39.745
Uh, no. She was my math tutor.
You paid her to come over.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.315
Oh. Well, how about Ernie Shmelding?

27:42.394 --> 27:44.988
- Uh, he moved.
- He did?

27:45.063 --> 27:47.031
Yeah, like last year.

27:47.098 --> 27:51.194
Wow. Oh! You know that
Veronica from my art class?

27:51.269 --> 27:55.501
Now, she seems like a really nice girl.
Maybe we could invite her over for tea.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.201
Mom! She's old.
She's like 20.

27:58.276 --> 28:00.608
Well, then I don't know what to say.

28:00.679 --> 28:05.582
You don't have to say anything.
I mean, I've come to grips with my situation.

28:05.650 --> 28:08.847
And besides, I've got
a new four-legged friend.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.854
Just promise you'll
be careful out there.

28:10.922 --> 28:14.255
I will. Don't worry.
I'll even wear that funky helmet.

28:14.325 --> 28:16.623
Thank you.
Now eat your dinner.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.294
Yeah, that, uh, soy cheese
really kicks it up a notch.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.361
I don't know why you make me eat these.

28:27.439 --> 28:31.102
- Kids should not have to eat veggie burgers.
- It's not that bad.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.667
Mom, it's not beef.
I love beef.

28:36.948 --> 28:41.180
<i># Tired of waiting
Gets so frustrating #</i>

28:41.252 --> 28:44.016
<i># Well, it's time to move #</i>

28:46.257 --> 28:49.988
<i># Gonna make changes
Some rearranging #</i>

28:50.061 --> 28:53.224
<i># Got nothing to lose #</i>

28:54.866 --> 28:59.633
<i># I've been lost it seems
most all the time #</i>

28:59.704 --> 29:03.333
<i># Now on my own
and I don't mind #</i>

29:03.408 --> 29:08.846
<i>- # The sun's about to shine #
- Hot!</i>

29:08.913 --> 29:11.677
<i># It only gets better
from here #</i>

29:11.750 --> 29:13.741
<i># Clouds are starting to clear#</i>

29:13.818 --> 29:17.515
<i># There'll be no more
stormy weather#</i>

29:17.589 --> 29:20.114
<i># It's gonna get better
than this #</i>

29:20.191 --> 29:23.354
Hi there, big boy.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.589
How are you doing this morning?

29:25.663 --> 29:29.895
I have a treat for you if you
promise not to tell my mom.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.768
Good morning, Mr. Longpre.

29:34.839 --> 29:38.639
You may as well start
with Tinkerbell's stall.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.702
- You gonna help?
- Here.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.044
Probably need that too.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.984
<i>- # It's a long road home #
- Tinkerbell.</i>

29:51.055 --> 29:53.421
<i># And I'll get there #</i>

29:53.491 --> 29:57.655
<i># When I do
I'll be so aware #</i>

29:57.729 --> 30:02.632
<i># Every time
that someone cares #</i>

30:02.700 --> 30:05.260
<i># It only gets better
from here #</i>

30:05.336 --> 30:07.702
<i># Clouds are starting to clear#</i>

30:07.772 --> 30:10.832
<i># There'll be no more
stormy weather#</i>

30:10.909 --> 30:14.208
<i># It's gonna get better
than this #</i>

30:14.279 --> 30:16.645
<i># 'Cause now I insist #</i>

30:16.714 --> 30:20.582
<i># I've got my life together#</i>

30:20.652 --> 30:23.746
<i># The time is finally here #</i>

30:23.822 --> 30:26.154
<i># It only gets better#</i>

30:28.226 --> 30:30.751
Wait. Wait.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.593
<i># If you never take chances
you will never know #</i>

30:33.665 --> 30:36.065
<i>- Okay.
- # It's a wonderful feeling #</i>

30:36.134 --> 30:38.500
<i># To finally let go #</i>

30:38.570 --> 30:41.505
<i>- Okay.
- # Through all this confusion you'll find you'll be #</i>

30:41.573 --> 30:45.270
Well, that- that was
supposed to be my job.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.402
- Okay. Okay.
- Have at it.

30:54.085 --> 30:57.282
<i># It only gets better#</i>

31:01.593 --> 31:03.686
Yeah. Good, huh?

31:05.029 --> 31:09.966
<i># There were times
I thought I never should #</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:13.197
<i># Somehow I felt I understood #</i>

31:13.271 --> 31:16.434
Sorry.

31:16.507 --> 31:18.805
I'm gonna come back later.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.778
<i># It only gets better
from here #</i>

31:21.846 --> 31:23.711
<i># Clouds are starting to clear#</i>

31:23.781 --> 31:27.740
<i># There'll be no more
stormy weather#</i>

31:27.819 --> 31:30.879
<i># It's gonna get better
than this #</i>

31:30.955 --> 31:33.753
<i># 'Cause now I insist #</i>

31:33.825 --> 31:37.226
<i># I got my life together#</i>

31:37.295 --> 31:40.162
<i># My time is finally here #</i>

31:40.231 --> 31:42.563
<i># It only gets better##</i>

31:42.634 --> 31:45.398
I'm finished, Mr. Longpre.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.564
- Did you give Fireball his supplements?
- Yes, sir.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.904
What about the water trough in the pasture?
Did you check it?

31:50.975 --> 31:55.571
I filled it to the brim and made sure
that I locked the gate behind me.

31:55.647 --> 31:58.207
Okay, go into the tack room...

31:58.283 --> 32:01.480
get that little western saddle
with the striped blanket.

32:01.552 --> 32:03.486
- I'll be in there in a minute.
- Yes!

32:06.491 --> 32:09.619
Sorry.
I won't make any more noise.

32:14.565 --> 32:17.864
Give a good tug on
the cinch like that...

32:17.936 --> 32:20.769
and the rabbit back
through the hole, got it?

32:20.838 --> 32:24.501
Got it. Now, how often do you
wash the saddle blanket?

32:25.977 --> 32:28.605
- Don't worry about the saddle blanket.
- Okay.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.648
- You can get on now.
- Okay.

32:30.715 --> 32:32.444
Uh-uh. Wrong side.

32:32.517 --> 32:37.079
Don't be darting around.
Horses are unpredictable animals.

32:37.155 --> 32:41.148
You gotta think before you move.
Get on the box.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.785
Here. Come on, Tinkerbell.

32:43.861 --> 32:46.125
Whoa.

32:46.197 --> 32:48.791
And always get on from the left.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.964
- How come?
- Stop asking so many questions.

32:53.037 --> 32:55.870
- Sorry.
- And stop apologizing all the time.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.805
<i>- Okay.
- Put your helmet on.</i>

32:57.875 --> 33:00.571
- Right.
- All right. Good.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.840
- You've got a natural seat.
- I do?

33:02.914 --> 33:05.474
Yeah. Sit up straight.
Good.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.747
Keep the weight on the balls
of your feet and your heels down.

33:08.748 --> 33:09.042
Okay.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.988
- Can I ask you one more question?
- If you must.

33:13.057 --> 33:15.924
How did he get the name Tinkerbell?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.861
He, uh- He came with that name
when I bought him.

33:18.930 --> 33:22.661
Well, I don't think he likes it.
Does he look like a Tinkerbell to you?

33:22.734 --> 33:26.830
- No.
- I think that he should be called Checkers.

33:26.904 --> 33:29.031
Call him whatever you want.

33:29.107 --> 33:31.632
Take him in the ring.

33:33.478 --> 33:35.912
Checkers.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.971
Good name.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.254
<i>- Sweetheart?
- Mm-hmm?</i>

33:45.323 --> 33:47.450
<i>Sweetheart, have you, uh,
seen my car keys?</i>

33:47.525 --> 33:51.757
No. Did you check your purse?

33:51.829 --> 33:54.525
Oh, no.
Where is my purse?

33:54.599 --> 33:57.193
I'll help you find it.

33:57.268 --> 34:00.135
Oh, where did I put it?

34:00.204 --> 34:02.536
- I wonder if I left it upstairs.
- Ah, here it is.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.700
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

34:04.776 --> 34:08.371
- Ah.
- What's going on, Mom?

34:08.446 --> 34:11.313
Um, nothing.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.215
- You look pretty.
- Well, thank you.

34:14.284 --> 34:17.982
I mean, you always look pretty.
It's just that... today you look extra pretty.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.958
Well, remember I told you,
I'm going to that poetry reading.

34:22.025 --> 34:24.494
And... that's it?

34:24.562 --> 34:29.123
All right. If you must know,
I'm- I'm meeting someone there.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.464
Oh, you are? Well, who?

34:31.536 --> 34:33.902
It's no big deal. I mean,
it's just a casual thing.

34:33.971 --> 34:37.407
No big deal? Well, when were
you planning on telling me this?

34:37.475 --> 34:41.002
Well, who is it, Mom?
I-I need names.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.672
Names? How many people do
you think I'm going out with?

34:43.748 --> 34:47.342
So it is a date. It's that guy
from the juice bar, isn't it?

34:47.418 --> 34:51.752
No, it's not the guy from the juice bar.
His name is Ben.

34:51.822 --> 34:56.418
Ben, your student Ben?
The one with the tie and the button-down?

34:56.494 --> 34:59.292
Well, yeah, but why do you
say it like that?

34:59.363 --> 35:01.957
Just be prepared.

35:02.033 --> 35:05.002
- For what?
- I think that he's a meat eater.

35:05.069 --> 35:07.594
Well, I ju- Okay, you know what?
Just hold on. Why?

35:07.672 --> 35:09.970
Why are you being so negative?

35:10.041 --> 35:13.135
Because you've tried this before
and it's never worked.

35:13.211 --> 35:17.705
You know, I've- I've gone on four dates
in the last three years.

35:17.782 --> 35:21.718
- Oh, no, I'm missing a button.
- See? He's already got you all off-kilter.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.016
No, he hasn't.
You have.

35:24.088 --> 35:27.649
I just don't understand why you
can't be happy with the way things are.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.659
Why do you have to go
and change everything?

35:29.727 --> 35:31.752
Sweetheart, I'm not
changing anything.

35:31.829 --> 35:34.696
I'm going to a poetry reading.
Oh, and now I'm late.

35:34.765 --> 35:36.665
So go.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.964
Well, I don't feel good
about leaving you like this.

35:39.036 --> 35:40.799
Mom, I'm fine.

35:40.872 --> 35:43.170
- I don't believe you.
- I am.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.766
- Really.
- All right.

35:45.843 --> 35:48.744
- Well, how do I look?
- You look great.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.714
- Thanks. Okay, I'll be home before 9:00.
- Okay.

35:51.782 --> 35:54.992
And, um, I have my cell
phone if you should need me.

35:54.993 --> 35:55.809
Mom, just go.

35:55.887 --> 35:59.288
Okay. I'm going.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.985
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.111
There you are.

37:23.441 --> 37:25.932
I wish you were here, Dad.

37:52.136 --> 37:54.764
Hey.

37:54.839 --> 37:56.932
I just wanted to let you know
I was home.

37:57.008 --> 38:00.034
Mmm. How'd it go?

38:03.347 --> 38:05.338
It was very nice.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.575
That's good.

38:11.188 --> 38:13.679
Is that Daddy's sweater?

38:13.758 --> 38:16.022
Yeah.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.825
Sweetheart, I want you
to know something.

38:23.901 --> 38:29.032
You're the most important thing in the world
to me and nothing would ever change that.

38:29.106 --> 38:31.040
I know that.

38:31.108 --> 38:34.202
And I will always love your father.

38:34.278 --> 38:36.872
No matter what happens,
I would never try to replace him.

38:36.947 --> 38:39.973
You understand that, don't you?

38:40.051 --> 38:43.612
I'm trying to.

38:43.688 --> 38:46.589
I know.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.091
I know it hurts.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.459
But it's gonna be okay.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.430
Really, it is.

38:56.734 --> 38:59.498
I love you, Mom.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.561
I love you too.

39:41.712 --> 39:44.272
Moondance. Hi.

39:44.348 --> 39:47.545
- You trying to wear a hole in that leather?
- No.

39:47.618 --> 39:50.451
- Sorry.
- You know what time it is?

39:50.521 --> 39:52.421
Around 8:00?

39:52.490 --> 39:55.482
No. It's time for
your one-month evaluation.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.618
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

39:57.695 --> 39:58.442
What evaluation?

39:58.443 --> 40:00.892
To see if you and Checkers
are ready to go out on a trail.

40:00.965 --> 40:04.526
- A trail?
- Yeah. And you passed.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.968
So saddle up.

40:18.315 --> 40:20.374
This is a really pretty area.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.749
And I can tell Checkers
likes it too.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.947
You're a good match for that horse.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.582
- It's funny how we met each other, isn't it?
- Yep.

40:27.658 --> 40:30.627
- Some might call it destiny.
- That's what my mom says.

40:32.329 --> 40:35.526
So, how long have you
been riding, Mr. Longpre?

40:35.599 --> 40:39.091
If you're gonna keep up with the questions,
you may as well call me Dante.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.866
Okay. How long have
you been riding, Dante?

40:41.939 --> 40:44.669
- Pretty much my whole life.
- Oh, wow.

40:44.742 --> 40:46.676
That's a long time.
You're really lucky.

40:46.744 --> 40:50.510
I think Buddy's picked up
something in his hoof.

40:50.581 --> 40:53.550
- Well, is that bad?
- No, I'll just have to pry it out.

40:55.486 --> 40:59.183
<i>Hey, while you do that, can I go trot Checkers
around that bend and bring him back?</i>

41:00.958 --> 41:03.426
Yeah, okay.
Just don't go too far.

41:03.494 --> 41:05.394
Okay.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.489
Come on, Checkers.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.235
Hi, Megan. Hi, Fiona.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.975
Hi, Moondance.
I didn't know you rode.

41:25.049 --> 41:28.883
- Yeah. I just started this summer.
- What kind of a horse is that?

41:28.953 --> 41:31.683
This is Checkers.
He's a pinto.

41:31.755 --> 41:33.848
I've never seen one at Devonshire.

41:33.924 --> 41:36.586
- Because we don't ride that breed.
- Why not?

41:36.660 --> 41:39.390
Because pintos can't jump.

41:40.898 --> 41:43.162
Come on, Megan.
Let's get out of here.

41:53.611 --> 41:57.445
- You know them?
- Yeah. They're friends from school.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.780
Hmph. They don't seem very friendly.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.376
No, I guess we're more like rivals.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.753
<i>Well, they shouldn't talk about things
they don't know anything about.</i>

42:06.824 --> 42:08.849
Why?
What don't they know?

42:08.926 --> 42:12.987
- Checkers is a very good jumper.
- He is?

42:13.063 --> 42:15.361
Excellent, as a matter of fact.

42:15.432 --> 42:18.333
How do you think
he keeps getting out?

42:18.402 --> 42:21.030
Wait! Well, Dante!

42:21.105 --> 42:26.737
When were you planning on telling me this?
Dante! Wait for me.

42:43.227 --> 42:46.822
Checkers, I don't know what I'm doing,
so I'm just gonna follow you.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.057
Hyah!

42:54.738 --> 42:57.434
Whoa!

43:00.244 --> 43:03.372
<i>Checkers, you were great.</i>

43:03.447 --> 43:05.347
<i>- I can do better.
- Moondance!</i>

43:05.416 --> 43:07.145
Uh-oh.

43:07.217 --> 43:10.584
- What are you doing?
- Oh-

43:10.654 --> 43:12.485
<i>You see- Oh, well, um...</i>

43:12.556 --> 43:15.525
Checkers and I were just testing out
his jumping capabilities.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.118
Not like that you're not.
Come on.

43:18.195 --> 43:21.255
But, it- it was just
our first attempt.

43:21.332 --> 43:25.359
I'm sorry, Dante.
Look.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.371
Just-Just don't- don't be mad at me.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.902
Why were you riding bareback?

43:29.903 --> 43:32.876
Well, I read that the western
saddle is too heavy for jumping.

43:32.943 --> 43:36.003
Well, that's right.
But that's still no excuse.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.640
I know it was stupid.
I'm sorry.

43:38.716 --> 43:43.653
If you're gonna jump
that horse, do it right.

43:43.721 --> 43:46.087
Here.

43:46.156 --> 43:48.351
This is an English saddle.

43:48.425 --> 43:51.019
- The girth's right there.
- Oh.

43:56.033 --> 43:58.160
Hey, this is you!

44:00.738 --> 44:03.673
- Yeah. So what?
- You never told me that you jumped.

44:03.741 --> 44:06.369
<i>- You never asked.
- Well, can you teach me?</i>

44:06.443 --> 44:09.970
- Nope.
- Why not?

44:10.047 --> 44:12.914
'Cause that part of my life is over.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.076
What do you mean by "over"?

44:15.152 --> 44:17.848
If you know how to jump,
then why not teach?

44:17.921 --> 44:20.913
<i>I mean, why do you live in this place all alone?
Where are all your customers?</i>

44:20.991 --> 44:23.983
That's enough!

44:24.061 --> 44:28.088
What I do with my life
is none of your business.

45:19.116 --> 45:22.108
I'm sorry.

45:22.186 --> 45:24.984
I didn't mean to ask
so many personal questions.

45:25.055 --> 45:28.218
You don't need to apologize.

45:29.960 --> 45:34.090
They were good questions.
Deserve an answer.

45:38.068 --> 45:41.970
You want to know why
I don't have any customers?

45:43.540 --> 45:46.998
I made some...

45:47.077 --> 45:49.272
bad choices in my life...

45:49.346 --> 45:54.841
and... it's affected my reputation.

45:57.354 --> 46:02.348
And once you've lost that,
it's... hard to get back.

46:04.795 --> 46:07.320
I think everyone deserves
a second chance.

46:08.832 --> 46:11.198
<i>- You think so, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

46:11.268 --> 46:15.602
I mean, you're a cool dude
and have a lot to offer.

46:19.276 --> 46:22.439
"Cool dude."

46:22.513 --> 46:25.971
<i>- I've never been called that before.
- Well, it's true.</i>

46:26.049 --> 46:31.487
And all you need is one spunky,
hardworking student who believes in you...

46:31.555 --> 46:34.888
and... the word will get out.

46:38.729 --> 46:41.027
And just where do you think...

46:41.098 --> 46:45.125
I'm gonna find this spunky student?

46:51.241 --> 46:53.505
Drop your weight in your heels.

46:53.577 --> 46:56.774
<i>You want to stay perfectly balanced.</i>

46:56.847 --> 46:58.906
Extend your arms.

47:01.185 --> 47:03.085
<i>Good.</i>

47:05.789 --> 47:08.781
Okay, take the reigns.

47:10.561 --> 47:12.552
That's good.

47:13.730 --> 47:18.224
Very good.
Anticipate his every move.

47:21.638 --> 47:23.629
Good.

47:28.579 --> 47:31.139
And-

47:35.052 --> 47:39.113
Soft hands. Good.

47:39.189 --> 47:42.522
Right leg. Good.

47:43.694 --> 47:45.559
Good!

47:45.629 --> 47:48.097
Uh-huh.

47:48.165 --> 47:51.896
<i>Ah-ah-ah-ah! Keep your eye on the jump.</i>

47:51.969 --> 47:54.403
<i>Soften your hands.</i>

47:54.471 --> 47:56.996
Sorry, Dante.

47:57.074 --> 47:58.905
Good.

48:00.978 --> 48:02.912
Here, Checkers.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.608
Are you ready?
Come on!

48:05.682 --> 48:08.207
All right!

48:09.753 --> 48:12.813
I'm over here! Now I'm over here!

48:12.890 --> 48:14.858
Wanna see this one?

48:14.925 --> 48:17.189
Come on, Checkers!

48:17.261 --> 48:19.422
Whoo!

48:19.496 --> 48:22.624
Oh! Yea!

48:26.403 --> 48:29.133
Up! Up!

48:29.206 --> 48:31.197
Whoo!

48:34.711 --> 48:36.906
Mom, I'm home.

48:41.251 --> 48:43.185
Mom?

48:49.993 --> 48:51.927
We're pretty good eaters.

48:51.995 --> 48:53.986
Moondance.
There you are.

48:58.068 --> 49:01.765
Uh, gentlemen, this is my
notoriously late daughter, Moondance.

49:01.838 --> 49:04.773
- Honey, this is Ben.
- So nice to meet you officially, Moondance.

49:04.841 --> 49:07.036
And I think you already
know Ben's son, Josh.

49:07.110 --> 49:09.044
Hey, Moondance.

49:09.112 --> 49:12.309
- Hi.
- Nice crash helmet.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.809
Oh. Right.

49:18.188 --> 49:22.955
Um, I'm- I'm sorry, but would you
please e-excuse me for a moment?

49:25.462 --> 49:29.660
Well, uh, we could all use
a little more iced tea. I'll be right back.

49:29.733 --> 49:31.724
<i>Moondance!</i>

49:31.802 --> 49:33.667
Moondance!
Moondance, wait up!

49:33.737 --> 49:36.672
- I cannot believe that you did this to me.
- Did what?

49:36.740 --> 49:40.608
I told you Ben and his son were coming for dinner.
The least you could've done was been on time.

49:40.677 --> 49:42.872
<i>I think you owe me an apology.</i>

49:42.946 --> 49:45.710
I'm sorry I was late.
I completely forgot.

49:45.782 --> 49:49.479
- Are you sure you didn't forget on purpose?
- No! I promise!

49:49.553 --> 49:51.851
All right.
You're forgiven.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.753
I can't believe he saw me like this.

49:53.824 --> 49:55.655
I don't understand why
you're being so dramatic.

49:55.726 --> 49:59.025
Because you never told me that
Mr. Button-down's son is Josh Wilson.

49:59.096 --> 50:03.897
Now he's here in this house
and I look like this. Thank you!

50:03.967 --> 50:08.563
First of all, his name is not Mr. Button-down.
It's Ben, and he's wearing a V-neck.

50:08.638 --> 50:10.606
<i>Well, whoop-di-la-da-do!</i>

50:14.044 --> 50:16.979
<i>Well, if you're done, I'll take your plates.</i>

50:17.047 --> 50:20.983
<i>That was a, um-a wonderful
and very innovative dinner.</i>

50:21.051 --> 50:23.884
I could've sworn
that eggplant was chicken.

50:23.954 --> 50:26.889
Mom can make anything
taste like chicken.

50:26.957 --> 50:29.824
Well, I'm glad you liked it, Ben.

50:31.194 --> 50:34.755
Uh, um, yeah. Thanks.
That was- It was really good.

50:34.831 --> 50:37.197
You're welcome.

50:37.267 --> 50:39.701
Mom, let me help you
with the dishes.

50:39.770 --> 50:42.204
- Oh, no, I'll get it.
- We'll be right back.

50:42.272 --> 50:44.263
Okay.

50:55.719 --> 50:59.655
I hope you have a fire extinguisher,
because I think I'm going down in flames.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.554
It wasn't that bad, was it?

51:03.160 --> 51:05.253
Yeah, you're right.

51:05.328 --> 51:07.262
Ben, I'm sorry.

51:07.330 --> 51:10.766
Nah, don't be. We all just have
to get to know each other.

51:10.834 --> 51:13.769
Well, I found out that Josh
is definitely not an eggplant man.

51:15.872 --> 51:19.740
But it's good for him to expand
his palate. You should try it sometime.

51:19.810 --> 51:23.075
- Me?
- Uh... or maybe not.

51:33.757 --> 51:36.317
Uh, y-your mom seems pretty cool.

51:36.393 --> 51:38.327
She is.

51:38.395 --> 51:42.525
I mean, besides her recent obsession
with tofu, she's awesome.

51:42.599 --> 51:46.035
Yeah, I guess my dad
really likes her.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.537
Where's your mom?

51:48.605 --> 51:52.268
Uh, she took off to Miami
with her boyfriend.

51:53.710 --> 51:55.644
Yeah. He's a jerk.

51:55.712 --> 51:57.475
I'm really sorry.

51:57.547 --> 51:59.378
It's okay.

52:01.985 --> 52:03.919
This is weird, huh?

52:03.987 --> 52:05.978
Definitely.

53:09.686 --> 53:12.849
Hey, Moondance.

53:12.923 --> 53:15.391
So, are you gonna go
watch the Bow River Classic?

53:15.458 --> 53:18.018
Um, I'm not sure.
Are you?

53:20.096 --> 53:22.724
<i>- You're kidding, right?
- Fiona won the Classic last year.</i>

53:22.799 --> 53:24.699
<i>And Megan came in fourth.</i>

53:24.768 --> 53:28.204
<i>- Third!
- Sorry! Third.</i>

53:28.271 --> 53:30.205
Hey, I have an idea.

53:30.273 --> 53:34.107
Since you like being around horses,
you could volunteer as one of our grooms.

53:34.177 --> 53:36.145
Love it!

53:36.213 --> 53:39.671
- You don't know how to tack up a horse, don't you?
- Of course she does.

53:39.749 --> 53:42.980
Remember, Megan.
She rides that little Indian pony.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.453
What's his name?
Crackers!

53:45.522 --> 53:47.456
<i>- It's Checkers.
- Whatever.</i>

53:47.524 --> 53:49.583
<i>- And he's actually jumping now.
- Really?</i>

53:49.659 --> 53:52.594
<i>In that case, why don't you
enter him in the competition?</i>

53:52.662 --> 53:55.825
<i>Oh. Gotta run. Toodles.</i>

54:06.710 --> 54:10.544
- What's this?
- Checkers and I want to enter the competition.

54:11.548 --> 54:13.482
Don't be ridiculous.

54:13.550 --> 54:16.348
Checkers can't compete
in the Bow River Classic.

54:16.419 --> 54:19.081
Why not?
He loves to jump.

54:19.155 --> 54:21.248
It's not his place.

54:21.324 --> 54:25.055
But it is. That's why he kept
jumping out of the paddock.

54:25.128 --> 54:27.028
He was trying to tell you something.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.292
And that's how we met each other.

54:29.366 --> 54:31.630
- Hmm.
- See? It's his destiny.

54:31.701 --> 54:34.636
I don't care how well he jumps.

54:34.704 --> 54:36.638
The fact is...

54:36.706 --> 54:39.539
Checkers isn't
a blue-blooded thoroughbred.

54:39.609 --> 54:41.804
But that's why he's so special.

54:41.878 --> 54:44.711
He won't be judged fairly.

54:44.781 --> 54:49.616
- Well, they have to at least give him a shot.
- They won't.

54:49.686 --> 54:52.678
It's the unspoken rule.

54:52.756 --> 54:54.724
I'm sorry.

54:56.426 --> 54:58.860
But... that's just wrong.

54:58.928 --> 55:03.422
Think about all the pinto ponies that can't
compete just because they're the wrong color.

55:03.500 --> 55:06.765
Checkers can out jump
those fancy horses any day.

55:06.836 --> 55:08.770
It's impossible.

55:08.838 --> 55:12.740
Be up against some of the best
trainers in the country.

55:12.809 --> 55:16.404
Are you afraid that Checkers
won't be judged fairly...

55:16.479 --> 55:18.470
<i>or that you won't?</i>

55:21.518 --> 55:23.418
Maybe both.

55:23.486 --> 55:26.717
Well, then you both have
something to prove.

55:26.790 --> 55:30.089
People are never going to change
unless you give them a reason.

55:38.468 --> 55:40.459
All right, fine.

55:41.504 --> 55:44.530
Let's see if we can
give 'em a reason.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.059
- Like that?
- You rushed it a little.

56:10.133 --> 56:12.067
Try it again.

56:12.135 --> 56:14.626
Come on.

57:14.063 --> 57:15.997
Was that good?

57:16.065 --> 57:18.499
Better.

57:18.568 --> 57:20.502
<i>Where are we going?</i>

57:20.570 --> 57:22.663
- Walk the course.
- Wh-What about Checkers?

57:22.739 --> 57:26.004
Leave him.
Five, six, seven, eight.

57:26.075 --> 57:28.509
Okay, I counted eight paces.

57:28.578 --> 57:30.512
Checkers' stride is three.

57:30.580 --> 57:33.014
How many strides
are you gonna make...

57:33.082 --> 57:35.516
if you add two for
the takeoff and landing?

57:35.585 --> 57:37.519
- You mean we have to do math?
- Yep.

57:37.587 --> 57:40.215
Well, can I go get
my pocket calculator?

57:40.290 --> 57:43.282
- Kidding!
- Well, get serious.

57:43.359 --> 57:45.953
You entered into
the Hunter division.

57:46.029 --> 57:49.430
And that means you can't just
run around clearing jumps.

57:49.499 --> 57:51.729
The judges are going to
be looking for finesse.

57:51.801 --> 57:54.998
<i>- They are?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

57:55.071 --> 57:57.505
And if you know how many
strides you're taking...

57:57.574 --> 57:59.508
then you and Checkers
will be in sync.

57:59.576 --> 58:03.205
So, how many times does three
go into eight, minus the two extra?

58:05.014 --> 58:07.141
- Two.
- Good!

58:07.217 --> 58:10.186
Did you hear that, Checkers?
We got a "good"!

58:10.253 --> 58:12.585
That was for the math,
not your riding.

58:14.991 --> 58:17.960
By the weekend, you need to
be practicing in your show boots.

58:18.027 --> 58:21.326
- But I don't have show boots.
- You'd better get some.

58:21.397 --> 58:23.331
- Get Checkers tacked up.
- Yes, sir.

58:23.399 --> 58:25.390
Hurry up!

58:26.703 --> 58:29.228
<i>Let me see.
Ladies riding boots.</i>

58:29.305 --> 58:32.001
There's, uh-
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

58:32.075 --> 58:34.009
Oh, those are lovely.

58:34.077 --> 58:37.012
Except that they're $549.

58:37.080 --> 58:39.014
Oh, my goodness!

58:39.082 --> 58:42.017
You could buy a whole horse for that!

58:42.085 --> 58:45.851
There must be something cheaper in here.
Let's see if we can find it.

58:45.922 --> 58:49.255
Oh, you know what?
Those are better- 185.

58:49.325 --> 58:52.158
Mom, have you forgotten about
our little financial situation?

58:52.228 --> 58:54.162
<i>Ah.
Got a winner.</i>

58:54.230 --> 58:55.993
I think I got a winner.

58:56.065 --> 58:58.863
<i>How about ladies
rubber riding boots.</i>

58:58.935 --> 59:01.495
- 29.99.
- Perfect!

59:01.571 --> 59:04.836
- Did you say they were rubber?
- How soon can you get them?

59:04.908 --> 59:07.206
I can get those in a couple of days.

59:07.277 --> 59:09.939
All right! What about
the riding jacket?

59:10.013 --> 59:12.004
Uh-

59:12.081 --> 59:14.515
th-they start at 275.

59:14.584 --> 59:16.518
Oh, man.

59:16.586 --> 59:18.144
Secondhand coat?

59:18.221 --> 59:19.950
- Sounds great.
- Oh, yeah!

59:20.023 --> 59:23.186
- Good choice.
- Yeah.

59:29.198 --> 59:31.132
Hey there, Fireball.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.395
Lunch is coming right up.

59:33.469 --> 59:36.404
Checkers?

59:36.472 --> 59:39.600
Checkers?

59:41.678 --> 59:44.203
What's the matter, boy?

59:44.280 --> 59:47.215
Oh, my goodness.

59:47.283 --> 59:49.274
Dante!

59:50.486 --> 59:52.477
Dante!

59:53.623 --> 59:56.353
Something's wrong with Checkers!

59:59.796 --> 01:00:02.663
<i>Easy, big boy.</i>

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.927
Easy.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.731
What's wrong with him, Dante?

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:10.739
Looks like a colic.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:13.742
Hand me that lead over there.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:16.643
<i>I've got to get him up.</i>

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:23.452
Easy. Easy.

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:26.579
Easy. Easy.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.351
Go call the vet.

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:35.654
I gotta keep him moving.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:38.200
Go on.
The number's on the phone.

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.258
Good boy. Good.

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:46.432
Well, thanks for coming out, Tom.

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:47.757
Wish I could do more.

01:00:47.758 --> 01:00:50.741
We tried to keep Checkers
walking as long as possible.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.974
That was the right thing to do.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:56.815
But Checkers doesn't want
to walk anymore right now.

01:00:56.886 --> 01:01:00.583
Only thing you can do is let him rest
and try again a little later.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.522
Yeah.

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:04.651
I don't want to paint
a hopeless picture...

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:07.662
but if that horse doesn't
get back on his feet tonight...

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:10.665
there's slim chance he'll
make it through till morning.

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:13.668
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:17.711
I'll check in on you later.
Call me if there's any change.

01:01:17.712 --> 01:01:18.298
Will do.

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.687
Well...

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:35.690
we're gonna let Checkers
rest for a while.

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:39.660
I talked to your mom.
She's bringing some supper over.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:44.429
Checkers has to get better, Dante.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.525
He just has to.

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:49.332
Well, we're not gonna lose hope.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:53.603
That horse has got a strong spirit.

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:56.668
Just like the little girl
who rides him.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.821
<i>Sweetheart, you're not eating.</i>

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.067
I can't.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.467
Just take a couple bites.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.740
May I go see Checkers now?

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:39.752
May as well let her go.

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.757
Sure.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.560
Thanks for bringing dinner, Mom.

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.598
I'm so sorry.

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:57.435
I know that this is
a difficult time for both of you.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.498
For her.

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:08.283
Hi there, Checkers.

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:26.862
Checkers, l- I know you're tired...

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:30.167
and I know you don't
feel like walking, but...

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:34.608
can you please
just try and get up now?

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:45.987
Y-Y-You don't even have to walk.
You could just-

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:48.888
You could just try and stand up.

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.497
Come on, Checkers.
l-

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.624
I know you can do it.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.260
If you could just try, please.

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.673
I love you so much.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.510
You're my best friend, and-

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:16.212
and I don't know what
I'd ever do without you.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.111
Please don't give up.

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.456
Please.
I will help you.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.864
If you could-you could just-
just try, Checkers.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.925
Just try.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.714
Checkers?

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:55.723
<i>Checkers.</i>

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:59.887
That's it, boy. Come on.
I-I know you can do it. Please?

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:03.898
Come on, Checkers.
You can do this.

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:08.369
Try moving your foot again.
That's it.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.564
Come on, Checkers.
l-

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.599
Lift your head up. Come on!
Come on, Checkers. Come on!

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:17.646
<i>There you go, boy.</i>

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:20.580
Checkers.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.811
Come on, Checkers.

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.750
Oh, yeah!

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.682
That's right!
Come on!

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:33.225
Checkers!
Oh, Checkers!

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.589
Dante! Mom!

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:39.658
<i>Come see!</i>

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:44.205
It's so good!

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:50.111
He did it!

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:52.170
Attaboy.

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:54.773
That's incredible.

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.683
Ah, you're looking strong.

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:02.087
Let's see if he'll eat
some warm bran.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:04.149
Wait a minute.

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.996
Oh!
He's hungry.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.999
<i>- Well, that's a good sign.
- That's the best sign.</i>

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:14.400
That means in a few days
he'll be good as new.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.234
Be the strongest horse
in the competition.

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:22.741
That taste good, Checkers?

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:28.908
Wow.
This is posh.

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:34.279
<i>Well, don't be intimidated by it.
It's just a barn like any other.</i>

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.341
Yeah.
Just fancier.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.681
Name, please.

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:43.953
I got Moondance Alexander
from Tumbleweed Stables.

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:46.859
- And Checkers.
- A-And Checkers.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:50.561
Okay, you can go on through.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.892
Huh. Well-

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:03.473
Moondance, I want you
to take Checkers into his stall.

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:06.879
- Buck and I'll bring the tack.
- Okay. Come on, boy.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.642
Good job.

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:28.560
<i>- What's that pinto doing here?
- Who knows.</i>

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:42.183
Mm-hmm.
Here we go.

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:52.020
This is nice, huh?

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.787
It's like a four-star hotel.

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:59.466
Ooh!
With room service.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.366
Thank you!

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:08.832
Ohh.
Say it isn't so.

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:12.346
<i>Hey, Checkers,
don't get too chummy with this one.</i>

01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:14.348
He's the defending champion.

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.316
<i>Right there.</i>

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.319
<i>- Good job.
- Hey!</i>

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:21.185
What do you got in there?
Gold bullion?

01:09:21.256 --> 01:09:23.384
- Well, we have to be prepared.
- Yeah.

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:26.394
Why don't you go sign in,
get your number.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:29.522
- We'll get Checkers ready.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.801
<i>- Hey, Mom!
- Hey!</i>

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:36.497
Oh, this is so exciting!

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:38.198
Isn't it amazing?

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.207
- Hi, Mr. Wilson.
- Hi.

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:42.210
- Hi, Josh.
- Hey.

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:44.881
We're really looking forward
to watching you ride today.

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:45.542
Oh, thank you.

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:49.345
<i>The warm-up ring is
now available for the Hunter division.</i>

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:51.352
Well, that's me.
I gotta go.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.389
- Okay. Don't forget your jacket.
- Oh. That's right.

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.390
<i>- Good luck.
- Uh, hey, Moondance.</i>

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:59.052
I just wanted to, uh,
wish you good luck.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.823
Thanks.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:02.887
I-I'll see you later.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:17.746
Great. You haven't
painted his hooves yet?

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:20.111
Can you please do it now?

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:22.116
Hi!

01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:24.118
Moondance?

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.120
You're showing today?

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:29.123
Yeah. I-I took your advice
and I entered my pinto.

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:31.125
Really!

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:33.127
That's amazing.

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:36.130
You'd better get ready.
They just called our division.

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:38.189
I-I'll be ready.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:42.065
<i>Checkers?</i>

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.071
Oh, my goodness!

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.073
You look so handsome!

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.075
You guys are awesome.

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:50.509
Well, Team Tumbleweed
at your service.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:53.013
- Better get your boots on.
- Okay.

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:03.982
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:08.091
- Is that Moondance?
- Can you believe it?

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.688
Oh, my gosh.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:14.010
Please tell me she isn't
putting on rubber boots right now.

01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:14.429
No way.

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.664
<i>She is!</i>

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:19.071
I can't believe
she's gonna show in those.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:21.109
<i>Who cares?</i>

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:23.406
It'll just make us look better.

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.647
Don't let them get to you.

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:40.127
You know why they're
putting you down, don't you?

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:43.187
- Why?
- 'Cause they're not sure of themselves.

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:48.397
- Get Checkers warmed up.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:05.046
I'm gonna go get myself
a good seat.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.054
Good luck, darlin'.
Knock 'em dead.

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:09.056
We're sure gonna try.

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:11.058
Okay.

01:12:13.362 --> 01:12:15.956
Let Checkers
get used to his surroundings.

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:20.331
Then once he settles in,
take him over to that jump a couple of times.

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:22.393
- All right.
- Okay.

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:29.133
- Hey!
- Slower horses stay on the outside.

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.951
Dante, surprised to see you here.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:42.286
Not as surprised as I am.

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:54.201
- That has got to be your pinto.
- Yep.

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.260
Moondance.

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:04.209
You have got to settle down, girl.

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:07.737
- Right.
- That turn was way too sharp.

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:12.048
Checkers can feel your energy,
so if you're focused, he'll be focused.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.214
- Okay.
- Remember.

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.280
You're a team.

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.292
Right.
We're a team.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.920
- Good. Try it again.
- Okay.

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:27.959
That's an unusual choice
for a hunter.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.914
Uh, any room over there?

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.916
Oh, yeah.
Right here.

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:44.111
- Yeah. There we go.
- There you go.

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:46.120
- Good to see you, Buck.
- You too.

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:49.351
- Where'd you get that hot dog?
- I got it over there.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.251
What- Did I miss somethin'?

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.024
I'll tell you later.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:59.761
- Hey, guys. Hi.
- Hey.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.963
This should be a riot.
Check out the guy in the monkey suit.

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:09.002
Freddie, if you're just gonna bash everyone,
sit somewhere else.

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.908
- Chill, dude.
- I'm serious.

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:14.471
Fine.
I'll go bash where I'm wanted.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.484
Good move.

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:19.419
- Hey, hot stuff.
- Hey. Josh is being moody again.

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:22.252
- Oh, forget him.
- Yeah.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:27.624
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the 10th Annual Bow River Classic.

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.926
<i>Joining us today from REV Sports TV...</i>

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:33.229
<i>our friends
Joe Cipriano and Mike Weir.</i>

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.770
<i>Well, thank you, Kirk.</i>

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.931
It's starting.
I'm so nervous.

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.667
She's gonna do great.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.437
I love this. I really love this.

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.672
<i>We're starting with Junior Hunters.</i>

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:48.147
Our first entry,
from Sonata Farms, number 230...

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:51.152
<i>Shannon McGinnis riding Uptown Girl.</i>

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.553
<i>Mike, Shannon is coming off a big win in Indio...</i>

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:56.557
<i>in the modified Hunter Classic.</i>

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:59.526
<i>I really think this horse suits her style.</i>

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:03.156
<i>They are moving nice
and quiet down this line. Very good.</i>

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:05.325
Aspen should be so much fun!

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.334
Megan, you're next.

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:10.371
<i>Now approaching the brown oxer.</i>

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:12.373
<i>She took off a little close.</i>

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:14.375
<i>She's gonna have to pick up the pace.</i>

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:17.970
- Good luck with your lead changes.
- Thanks for reminding me.

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.842
<i>Now coming up to the final jump.</i>

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:24.852
<i>Oh, that's a very solid ride
for Miss McGinnis!</i>

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.980
<i>Next entry, from Devonshire Farms...</i>

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:31.890
<i>number 246,
Megan Montgomery riding Avalon.</i>

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.087
<i>This is a new horse for Megan.</i>

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:37.154
<i>That's right. He's a terrific Irish thoroughbred.</i>

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:41.162
<i>Ooh, good takeoff there.</i>

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.830
<i>This horse could give her
the edge she needs with the judges.</i>

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:46.568
Get off the phone, Fiona.

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:48.576
Hey, I gotta go.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.578
I'll call you later.
Bye.

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:53.740
Do you wanna go over the course one more time?

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:57.717
Please. I can do this blindfolded.

01:15:57.786 --> 01:16:01.187
<i>So far, this is a stylish presentation.</i>

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:03.884
<i>- I am very impressed.
- Okay.</i>

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:07.360
All right, you see
this combination here?

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.556
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- That's gonna be tight.</i>

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.565
You want to be nice and quiet
going into it.

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:13.624
- Okay. Nice and quiet.
- Yeah.

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:19.271
<i>Great ride for Megan Montgomery!</i>

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:20.933
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:23.910
<i>She might have had
a slight bobble in her last lead change.</i>

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:27.779
<i>But she was in that far corner-
I'm not so sure the judges even saw it.</i>

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:30.784
<i>If that's the case,
it would put her in the running for the top five.</i>

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:33.116
Checkers, no, no.
You cannot eat the flowers.

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:35.713
<i>We're watching Ted Michaels now.</i>

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:38.487
<i>He's an impressive competitor,
always in ribbons.</i>

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:43.797
- Nice ride.
- I missed my lead change.

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:47.062
- Well, besides that.
- Don't worry, Megan. It was just a hop.

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:49.626
<i>Judges probably didn't even notice.</i>

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.764
<i>Trained by his father, James Michaels...</i>

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.274
<i>who is a former
Olympic champion, of course.</i>

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:56.277
<i>That takeoff
was a little rushed there.</i>

01:16:56.345 --> 01:17:00.782
<i>The one thing you can count on from Ted
is that he always remains cool and confident.</i>

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:04.080
- Remember, you're the champion.
- I know.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.416
<i>Next entry, from Devonshire Farms...</i>

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.425
and last year's Bow River
Junior Hunter Champion...

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:14.621
number 251, Fiona Hughes,
riding Monte Carlo.

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:18.154
- Yes!
- Yea! Whoo!

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:21.168
<i>Everyone has their eyes on this young lady.</i>

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.466
<i>She is the one to beat.</i>

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.768
<i>Let's not count out
Shannon McGinnis or Megan Montgomery.</i>

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.934
<i>They both had excellent rides today.</i>

01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:36.083
<i>Monte Carlo is a six-year-old
Hanoverian gelding with a championship pedigree.</i>

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:44.358
<i>So far she is riding this course perfectly.</i>

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:50.795
<i>Mike, you were asking me what the judges
are looking for. Well, this is it.</i>

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:53.426
<i>Exquisite horse, superb equitation.</i>

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.970
<i>Perfectly turned out.
Rider elegant- coat, custom boots.</i>

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.700
<i>I mean, it's the whole package.</i>

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:02.476
They are flawless.

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:04.978
<i>Coming up to the last line.</i>

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:08.414
<i>She'll need to slow it down
to make this tight combination.</i>

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:13.714
<i>And what a performance
by Fiona Hughes!</i>

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:16.724
<i>Absolutely beautiful.
Joe, do you think it was enough to win it?</i>

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:19.367
<i>You never can tell
which way the judges will go.</i>

01:18:19.368 --> 01:18:20.159
You rock! You rock!

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:22.560
<i>But that was outstanding!</i>

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:26.158
- That was a lovely ride.
- Yeah, it's a fancy horse.

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:29.169
<i>And now we're down to our last competitor.</i>

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:32.172
- That was perfect.
- What did you expect?

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.038
That was a really good ride.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.670
<i>- Oh, thanks.
- This is a new name on the circuit, Mike.</i>

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:41.204
<i>I don't know too much about her
or her horse, for that matter.</i>

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.116
Okay, take a nice, deep breath.

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:47.314
<i>I'll update you as soon
as we have more information.</i>

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.687
You might want to exhale.

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.691
All right.
Got the course visualized?

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:56.060
Yes.

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:57.860
Okay.
You're ready.

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:00.561
Thank you, Dante.

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.967
Go get 'em.

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:08.006
<i>Our last entry,
from Tumbleweed Stables, number 224-</i>

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.010
- There she is.
- There she is.

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:13.411
<i>Moondance Alexander riding Checkers.</i>

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:15.507
- All right, Moondance!
- All right!

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:18.815
This ought to be interesting.

01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:27.328
Hey, Moondance, the rodeo was last week!

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:31.331
<i>Joe, have you ever seen
a pinto entered in this division?</i>

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:34.391
<i>Not in a major classic like this one.</i>

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:39.163
<i>Hey, why don't you get a real horse!</i>

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:51.313
Okay, Checkers.
We can do this.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.528
Oh! Oh, she made it!
She made it!

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.569
- Breathe. It's only the first jump.
- Yeah!

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.901
<i>He seems to be moving well so far.</i>

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:15.671
<i>He certainly does. Pintos usually
have a much shorter stride than this horse.</i>

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.704
<i>Look at that!</i>

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.305
<i>Moondance is trained by Dante Longpre.</i>

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.977
<i>Now, there's a name
we haven't heard in quite a while.</i>

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:27.647
<i>Dante fell out of the scene after one of
his young riders crashed through a jump...</i>

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:29.656
<i>and was seriously injured.</i>

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:32.156
<i>It wasn't certainly anything
Dante could have prevented.</i>

01:20:32.157 --> 01:20:33.251
Nice to see him back.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.421
<i>Wow! This little horse can really jump!</i>

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:39.900
<i>I can't help wonder what the judges
are thinking right now.</i>

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:43.495
<i>And Moondance seems very relaxed
for her first time in a major competition.</i>

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:48.100
<i>Dante is known for his strict conditioning
of his riders. We're seeing the result today.</i>

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:50.076
Easy.

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:52.113
<i>She's approaching the single oxer.</i>

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.943
I can't watch!

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:56.916
<i>It's been giving riders trouble all day.</i>

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.953
<i>- It's no trouble for Moondance.
- Yes!</i>

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.049
Did she make it?

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:03.252
Keep your eyes open. You're
gonna miss the whole thing.

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.724
<i>The most challenging part
of the course is still ahead.</i>

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:09.730
<i>Beautiful lead change right there.</i>

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.561
Quiet him down, Moondance.

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:14.431
<i>She needs to down-shift around this corner.</i>

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:18.029
- Easy, boy.
- She's heading in way too fast.

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:22.799
They're gonna crash and burn
on this combination.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:26.041
<i>This is where experience really comes into play...</i>

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:27.979
<i>which is something this young lady
just doesn't have yet.</i>

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:30.381
Come on. Come on.

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:34.717
<i>This is it. The final combination.</i>

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:39.749
<i>But can Moondance maintain her focus
and composure over these last two jumps?</i>

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:48.928
<i>This little horse might have
a big enough heart to take her all the way!</i>

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:53.338
<i>If they can just keep
this last stride into the final oxer.</i>

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:07.754
<i>Unbelievable! They've done it!</i>

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:10.812
<i>What an amazing event
this has turned out to be!</i>

01:22:10.813 --> 01:22:10.985
Yes!

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:15.655
<i>It's this kind of talent that makes this sport
so exciting and so unpredictable.</i>

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.664
Way to go!

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:22.196
Yeah! She made it!
How was it? Was it all right?

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:23.999
It sure was.

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:26.700
I can't believe she made it through
with no mistakes.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:30.370
<i>There's still no way she can win.
Not on that horse.</i>

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:33.414
<i>These two underdogs,
Mike, have come out of nowhere.</i>

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:36.882
Checkers, you were brilliant.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:42.180
A good boy.
Let's go.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.651
Oh.

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:51.164
I am very, very proud of you.

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:54.065
Thank you.
Wasn't Checkers amazing?

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.069
You both were.
Good job, buddy.

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:58.071
But was that good?

01:22:58.139 --> 01:23:00.073
- It was great.
- Oh, yea!

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:02.507
Checkers! We got a "great!"

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:04.408
Thank you, Dante.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:06.640
Now what's happening?

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:09.115
Well, now we have to
wait for the results.

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:12.051
<i>There seems to be a heated
conversation going on at the judges' table.</i>

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.554
- It's a pinto.
- It's a horse.

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:18.217
- When was the last time we had a pinto in this-
- What seems to be the problem?

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:20.730
We're having a disagreement
about the black-and-white horse.

01:23:20.731 --> 01:23:21.729
What kind of disagreement?

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.889
- We don't know where he fits in.
- He doesn't.

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:27.833
A pinto doesn't fit in the Winner's Circle
of the Junior Hunter Classic.

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:28.424
I disagree.

01:23:28.425 --> 01:23:31.269
You need to make a decision.
We've got to announce a winner.

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:33.739
I'm not budging on this.

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:38.575
<i>Moondance and Checkers
might be forcing them to consider...</i>

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.944
<i>a more diverse playing field
than they're used to.</i>

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.155
<i>While we're waiting
for a decision from ourjudges...</i>

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:52.216
<i>could we have the Junior Hunter division
trot into the ring, please?</i>

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:58.091
<i>Well, win or lose, you gave 'em
something to think about.</i>

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.157
All right.

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:11.109
<i>All right, Moondance!</i>

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.705
<i>Let's go, Megan!</i>

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:36.161
And now for the results of
the Junior Hunter Bow River Classic.

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:42.009
<i>Sixth place goes to Jill Blake
riding Hot Tamale.</i>

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.376
<i>Fifth place goes to Katie Harrison
riding Tango Dancer.</i>

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:49.180
<i>4th place goes to Olivia
Kay riding Sophie's Trophy.</i>

01:24:49.181 --> 01:24:50.180
Congratulations.

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:54.085
<i>Third place goes to Ted Michaels
riding Alexandra.</i>

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:56.487
Congratulations.
Another good ride.

01:24:56.558 --> 01:25:00.858
Second place goes to Shannon McGinnis
riding Uptown Girl.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.863
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:07.359
And for first place...

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:12.029
we have a tie.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:17.938
<i>Our Bow River Junior Hunter Classic
champions are...</i>

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:20.947
- Fiona Hughes riding Monte Carlo-
- Whoo!

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:27.183
and Moondance Alexander...

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:29.018
<i>riding Checkers!</i>

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.524
- We won?
- What?

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:33.060
Yes!

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.790
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:38.298
Are you kidding me?

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:42.530
We won, Checkers! We won!
Oh, good job, boy!

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:45.129
<i>Oh! They won!</i>

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:47.731
I'll be right back.
I will be right back.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:50.004
Congratulations once again.
Very good ride.

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:52.410
- There we are.
- Thank you.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:58.976
Not a bad little horse you got there, Dante.
Not bad at all.

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:07.258
Congratulations. This was a very good victory
for you and your horse.

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:11.264
Thank you!
But we did have a lot of help.

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:16.970
We'd like a photograph in a moment.

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:19.336
Oh, sure!
Certainly!

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:21.341
Oh, good job, Checkers.

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:23.400
<i>Let's put the blanket on the horse.</i>

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:30.551
Hey, um, Fiona, congratulations.

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:33.086
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:35.554
I really like your horse.

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:39.252
Oh! Thank you! Yeah,
he's a pretty good boy.

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:43.627
I've actually been looking for a new place to ride.
How is Tumbleweed Stables?

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:47.759
Well, it's nothing fancy, but you really get
a lot of personalized attention.

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:51.202
<i>- Sounds great. I'll have to check it out.
- Moondance!</i>

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.177
Can you hold this for just one second?
Thank you.

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:59.839
<i>Let's give a hand to our
Junior Hunter Classic champion Fiona Hughes!</i>

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:04.783
Well, that was the most fantastic
and hair-raising experience of my life.

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.786
- You were amazing!
- Thank you!

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:10.756
<i>- Looks like you're going to the winner's banquet.
- You mean we're going.</i>

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.759
<i>Moondance!
They're ready for your photo!</i>

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:15.022
I gotta run.

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:19.055
Hey, Mom, um, do you wanna
invite Ben to come with us?

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:22.335
Really?

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.633
Yeah, I mean, I was thinking...

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:28.233
Ben may be different,
but he still deserves a chance.

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:31.335
What about Josh?
Is he invited too?

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:34.745
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:59.262
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:02.762
<i>let's hear it for our Bow River
Junior Hunter Classic champion...</i>

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.678
<i>Moondance Alexander and Checkers!</i>

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.281
Thanks, Daddy.

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:54.451
Oh, and don't worry
about me and Mom.

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:57.362
We're gonna be all right.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:17.851
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:19.853
How do you do?

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:22.913
Let's have a look at that pony.

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.322
<i>#I choose you #</i>

01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:06.356
<i># From the billions

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:11.929
<i># I will be changed
from the moment I do #</i>

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:14.236
<i># Yeah, I'll choose you #</i>

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:16.503
<i># When the clouds part #</i>

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:21.071
<i># A thousand guitars start #</i>

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:24.118
<i># I choose you #</i>

01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:27.018
<i># I choose you #</i>

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:32.355
<i># I choose you #</i>

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:37.160
<i># Choose me too ##</i>

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:58.943
<i>#You were there for me #</i>

01:31:00.354 --> 01:31:05.382
<i># Someone kind and gentle #</i>

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:09.521
<i># But like stars
in the night #</i>

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:14.193
<i># You slipped away #</i>

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:19.063
<i># I wish you could be #</i>

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:25.512
<i># With me on this journey #</i>

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:29.949
<i># All my fears inside #</i>

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:35.114
<i># Would fade away #</i>

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:40.320
<i># If I could find #</i>

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:44.956
<i># A place of mine #</i>

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:47.432
<i># For memories #</i>

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.993
<i># And secret dreams #</i>

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:53.973
<i># And hopes that never die #</i>
