WEBVTT

00:10.518 --> 00:12.102
All right, Lemon, you got me.

00:12.136 --> 00:15.216
Yes, this is the same flashy night tie

00:15.217 --> 00:16.857
I was wearing when I left work yesterday.

00:16.908 --> 00:18.158
My hair is a disaster.

00:18.193 --> 00:20.644
I am indeed on a walk of shame.

00:20.662 --> 00:21.979
You slut!

00:22.013 --> 00:24.398
That woman was Pizzarina Sbarro,

00:24.449 --> 00:27.517
the heiress to the
<i>Sbarro Slice and Calzone Fortune</i>.

00:27.535 --> 00:29.203
I should be heading upstairs to change,

00:29.237 --> 00:31.288
I wouldn't want anyone seeing me

00:31.322 --> 00:32.322
like this.

00:32.356 --> 00:34.191
Come on.
Walk of shame?

00:34.209 --> 00:35.909
I say call it a stride of pride

00:35.960 --> 00:38.128
and walk with your arms up, like this.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.164
That is surprisingly
non-judgmental.

00:40.198 --> 00:41.248
I'm 41 years old, Jack.

00:41.299 --> 00:43.167
I'm no stranger to the walk of shame.

00:43.201 --> 00:46.036
Yes, I'm still wearing
the same clothes as yesterday.

00:46.054 --> 00:47.504
I stayed up all night

00:47.538 --> 00:50.207
helping Bradley finish the Joseph coat.

00:50.225 --> 00:52.976
Just hearing that story
tells me that Bradley was gay.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.094
Only sexually.

00:54.145 --> 00:55.585
But I've come a long way since then.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.381
In fact, since Criss and I
have been trying,

00:58.400 --> 01:00.267
Liz Lemon has had a little awakening

01:00.318 --> 01:01.735
in her bathing suit area.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.237
Lemon, I've seen your bathing suits.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.150
- That could be anywhere.
- I'm serious, Jack.

01:05.185 --> 01:06.705
I feel like I'm ready for one of those

01:06.706 --> 01:08.075
<i>Sex and the city Girls' brunches,</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:11.061
where you talk about dirty stuff
and make a lot of puns, like,

01:11.079 --> 01:13.330
"and I thought
I was eating eggs."

01:13.364 --> 01:16.083
So is Zarina your new girlfriend?

01:16.117 --> 01:18.836
Should I, invite her
to my sex talk brunch?

01:18.870 --> 01:20.737
Zarina is not my girlfriend,

01:20.755 --> 01:23.340
she's one of a diverse group
of women I'm currently seeing.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.242
Group?
Back to judgmental.

01:25.260 --> 01:27.528
Lemon, after Avery, I realized
I'm never going to find

01:27.529 --> 01:29.129
everything I'm looking for in one woman.

01:29.180 --> 01:30.597
It's not fair to the ladies,

01:30.632 --> 01:32.582
just because I'm the complete package.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.185
- You are a complete package.
- I got the idea

01:35.220 --> 01:37.888
watching <i>The Great Escape</i>
on TCM one night,

01:37.922 --> 01:39.940
how that ragtag bunch of heroes

01:39.974 --> 01:42.926
worked together to be greater
than the sum of their parts.

01:42.944 --> 01:43.944
Bronson was the brawn,

01:43.978 --> 01:45.362
Attenborough was the brains,

01:45.396 --> 01:46.763
garner was the scrounger,

01:46.781 --> 01:48.765
McQueen was the hottie with the body.

01:48.783 --> 01:50.317
I'll say it.

01:50.368 --> 01:51.618
And, how many prisoners

01:51.653 --> 01:53.370
do you have in this little stalag?

01:53.404 --> 01:56.106
Zarina is the society girl
I take to black-tie events,

01:56.124 --> 01:57.908
when I want to talk politics I call Anne,

01:57.942 --> 02:00.077
Tabitha knows how to work my DVR,

02:00.111 --> 02:02.246
and Mindy is my, sex idiot.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.164
And what if they
find out about each other?

02:04.215 --> 02:06.095
They're all adults, Lemon.
They'll understand.

02:06.096 --> 02:07.296
And if they did come to blows,

02:07.297 --> 02:09.252
it would be,

02:09.287 --> 02:10.787
Intensely erotic.

02:10.805 --> 02:11.922
Like,

02:11.956 --> 02:14.641
Steve McQueen on a motorcycle.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.677
Trying to jump that fence
into Switzerland,

02:16.728 --> 02:17.811
but it's too high.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.932
He had a leather jacket.

02:24.486 --> 02:26.186
Hey, lady friends.

02:26.237 --> 02:28.155
Who would like to join me for brunch?

02:28.189 --> 02:29.189
My treat.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.275
We could throw back some cosmos,

02:31.309 --> 02:33.494
talk about our climaxes...

02:35.697 --> 02:37.114
If you heard my sex stories,

02:37.148 --> 02:38.499
you would lose your mind!

02:38.533 --> 02:40.117
Sorry, Liz.

02:40.151 --> 02:41.952
I'm not even sure
they serve brunch after...

02:41.986 --> 02:43.153
The '90s.

02:43.171 --> 02:44.321
Liz, check this out.

02:44.339 --> 02:45.989
"Jenna Maroney,
looking great at..."

02:46.007 --> 02:48.325
56?
Blarf!

02:48.343 --> 02:50.103
Okay, we are
at a code orange here, people.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.513
A magazine has said that Jenna is 56.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.131
God, no...
I have children!

02:54.165 --> 02:55.445
We'll get through this together.

02:55.463 --> 02:56.863
Pete, you go down to the newsstand.

02:56.864 --> 02:58.602
Buy every copy, and burn them.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.603
Cerie, get out of here.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.138
Just go home for the day.

03:01.172 --> 03:02.856
And Kenneth, get Jenna's copy

03:02.891 --> 03:04.975
out of her dressing room
before she sees it.

03:05.009 --> 03:07.444
Got it?

03:07.478 --> 03:08.645
My God, Liz.

03:08.679 --> 03:10.731
I am furious.

03:10.782 --> 03:12.582
You know what would
make us all feel better?

03:12.583 --> 03:13.317
A ladies' brunch.

03:13.351 --> 03:15.285
These bitches are down for it.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.787
How can you be so calm?

03:16.821 --> 03:19.156
I mean, why would Tracy do this to you?

03:19.190 --> 03:20.991
Wait, what are we talking about?

03:21.025 --> 03:23.360
"I agree @therealstephenhawking.

03:23.378 --> 03:24.527
"Women are not funny.

03:24.546 --> 03:25.796
"Never have been.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.414
Never will be."

03:27.465 --> 03:29.716
Nerd rage!

30 ROCK
S07 Ep03 - Stride of Pride

03:45.742 --> 03:49.042
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:49.103 --> 03:51.514
How am I supposed to
explain this to Jenna,

03:51.540 --> 03:53.323
who has been your comedy partner

03:53.358 --> 03:54.741
for almost seven years?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.109
Do you want me to talk to her?

03:56.160 --> 03:59.196
Honestly, I never realized
she was trying to be funny.

03:59.230 --> 04:01.164
I guess I just thought
she was a wig model.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.367
- Unacceptable.
- Come on, Lem Lizzit.

04:03.401 --> 04:05.335
Name one truly funny woman.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.871
No. I refuse to answer
this question with a list.

04:07.905 --> 04:08.922
It's insulting.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.624
You wouldn't ask an Asian person

04:10.675 --> 04:12.676
to give you a list of good Asian drivers.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.412
Gary Tang, Ziang Chu, Roy Chung...

04:15.430 --> 04:17.297
- Stop it.
- I was done anyway.

04:17.348 --> 04:19.749
Look, if women are so funny,

04:19.767 --> 04:22.219
do something funny right now.

04:22.253 --> 04:23.687
Welcome to the flower shop...

04:23.721 --> 04:26.056
No! I don't have to prove
anything to you.

04:26.090 --> 04:29.059
Maybe men and women
find different things funny.

04:29.093 --> 04:32.279
Maybe things that men like
are boring to women.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.097
No, everyone likes our things.

04:34.115 --> 04:35.115
Football.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.283
Motorcycles.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.434
Steak restaurants.

04:37.452 --> 04:39.486
Really dark superhero movies.

04:39.537 --> 04:41.938
These are things that suck.

04:41.956 --> 04:43.657
But women don't go around wasting our time

04:43.708 --> 04:45.075
writing articles about them.

04:45.109 --> 04:49.946
And I am not gonna waste my time
engaging you on this topic.

04:49.964 --> 04:51.715
Well, that went well.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.483
See? That's the kind of
hilarious button

04:53.518 --> 04:55.335
chicks can't come up with.

05:02.894 --> 05:05.429
What is it, Kenneth?
I'm answering my fan mail.

05:05.463 --> 05:08.565
Nothing.
Just doing my daily rounds.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.234
My lips are so dry.

05:11.269 --> 05:15.439
I better wet them with this mop.

05:15.473 --> 05:16.740
No.

05:16.774 --> 05:20.911
Now my undershirt is wet with mop juice.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.613
I see what's going on here.

05:23.647 --> 05:25.248
You be the janitor,

05:25.283 --> 05:27.000
and I'll be the piece of gum on the floor

05:27.035 --> 05:28.651
that you just can't chisel off.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.287
Sure is hot in here.

05:30.321 --> 05:33.156
Maybe I should roll up my pants.

05:33.174 --> 05:34.374
Yeah.

05:34.425 --> 05:35.665
Show me that part of your shins

05:35.666 --> 05:39.096
that's hairless from your synthetic socks.

05:40.831 --> 05:41.998
Liz, Liz, Liz.

05:42.016 --> 05:43.300
Thank God.

05:43.334 --> 05:45.001
Also, I called in a fake page six item

05:45.019 --> 05:46.269
about how young Jenna is.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.521
I think our bases are covered.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.889
Wow.
Okay, great.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.140
We solved our Jenna problem.

05:50.174 --> 05:52.675
We did it!
Story over.

06:18.219 --> 06:19.803
Are you hungry?

06:19.837 --> 06:20.804
No, I'm okay.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.806
Do you want to go to a movie, or...

06:22.840 --> 06:24.541
No. We can
just do it.

06:24.559 --> 06:27.227
Okay.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.979
Zarina, hello.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.013
Jack.

06:30.047 --> 06:31.932
This is Mindy.
Mindy, Zarina.

06:31.983 --> 06:34.067
- Pleasure.
- Yeah.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.602
Shiny.

06:35.653 --> 06:37.354
Look, I know this is awkward.

06:37.388 --> 06:38.989
But we never said we were exclusive.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.440
And like
a silver-backed gorilla

06:40.491 --> 06:41.742
or Mitt Romney's grandfather,

06:41.776 --> 06:43.276
I require more than one woman to...

06:43.327 --> 06:44.561
Jack, I understand.

06:44.579 --> 06:47.080
I'm sure Mindy gives you
certain things I can't.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.231
Indeed.

06:48.249 --> 06:49.899
The woman appears to have no hip joints.

06:49.917 --> 06:51.835
Thank you for being so,

06:51.869 --> 06:53.086
Zarina.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.422
Another old guy wanted to buy my shirt.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.007
Old guys are so funny.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.008
Who is this?

06:58.042 --> 07:00.076
Jack, Ryan.
Ryan, Jack.

07:00.094 --> 07:02.179
- Ryan.
- What's up?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.848
Ryan is my sex idiot.

07:07.935 --> 07:09.352
So, the other night

07:09.387 --> 07:12.589
my boyfriend and I were making love,

07:12.607 --> 07:15.758
and I suggested that we wear sleep masks.

07:15.777 --> 07:18.428
I hit my nose pretty hard

07:18.443 --> 07:19.563
on the bedside table, but...

07:19.597 --> 07:20.730
Liz Lemon.

07:20.764 --> 07:22.866
I just saw this hilarious dude on YouTube.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.934
You gotta put him on the show.

07:24.952 --> 07:26.653
No, it's...

07:26.704 --> 07:28.572
Of course, a hilarious dude.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.440
What was it, some idiot who let his friend

07:30.458 --> 07:32.576
- skateboard over his penis?
- Even better.

07:32.610 --> 07:35.378
It's a monkey, and his name is
Professor Wigglebottom.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.413
A monkey?

07:36.447 --> 07:37.999
So no women are funny,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.800
but you want me
to put a monkey on the show.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.385
My God, are we still talking about that?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.120
We debated this already, and I won.

07:44.138 --> 07:46.389
Tracy, I'm not putting any monkeys on <i>TGS</i>.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.641
Because you know what?

07:47.675 --> 07:49.059
I don't think monkeys are funny.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.628
How dare you generalize so crassly.

07:51.646 --> 07:52.846
- I'm offended.
- Okay.

07:52.897 --> 07:54.231
Name one funny monkey.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.965
Bonzo, Clyde, the bear...

07:55.983 --> 07:58.652
No! I refuse to answer
this question with a list.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.521
It's insulting to monkeys,
and their descendants...

08:01.572 --> 08:02.572
Humans!

08:02.607 --> 08:05.141
I win again.

08:05.159 --> 08:06.660
You're okay with this, right, Jack?

08:06.694 --> 08:08.311
Of course.
How could I not be?

08:08.329 --> 08:09.446
I'm great-escaping you,

08:09.480 --> 08:11.081
so you have every right to do the same.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.283
My generation calls it pokemoning.

08:13.317 --> 08:15.452
Gotta catch 'em all.

08:15.486 --> 08:17.204
I assume your, sex idiot

08:17.255 --> 08:18.821
gives you something I cannot.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.640
Although I can't imagine
what that might be.

08:22.677 --> 08:25.262
Really?

08:25.296 --> 08:27.163
So how many other pokemons are there?

08:27.181 --> 08:28.665
Jack.

08:28.683 --> 08:32.852
The plural of Pokemon
is "Pokemon."

08:32.886 --> 08:33.854
Mindy... Mindy...

08:33.888 --> 08:36.139
No, Ryan Lochte!

08:36.173 --> 08:39.173
- Look at me... focus.
- Mindy.

08:42.832 --> 08:43.883
Ms. Maroney.

08:43.918 --> 08:46.002
Did you see this newspaper headline?

08:46.036 --> 08:49.038
"Teens gone wild: Is Jenna
Maroney partying too hard?"

08:49.056 --> 08:51.091
Be careful, you don't want
to turn out like

08:51.142 --> 08:52.559
Amanda Byne-us.

08:52.593 --> 08:54.544
Did I do it right?

08:54.562 --> 08:56.045
That's a lie.

08:56.063 --> 08:58.398
I am much too old to party.

08:58.432 --> 09:00.049
I watch <i>Castle,</i>

09:00.067 --> 09:01.818
and my purse is filled with sweet'n lows.

09:01.852 --> 09:03.886
Liz, can I ask you a question?

09:03.904 --> 09:05.221
Don't let her take me.

09:05.239 --> 09:06.999
It's not gonna be a question,
it's gonna be

09:07.000 --> 09:08.792
a series of mean statements.

09:08.826 --> 09:10.827
If I find out that someone around here

09:10.861 --> 09:13.563
planted this disgusting story
that I'm young,

09:13.581 --> 09:15.865
I'm gonna do to them
what I did to my own ribs...

09:15.899 --> 09:17.667
Take them out.

09:17.701 --> 09:19.569
Jeezit was me, okay?
I did it.

09:19.587 --> 09:22.338
Then <i>Magazine</i> said I was 56.

09:22.373 --> 09:24.374
- Wait, you saw that?
- Well, of course I did.

09:24.408 --> 09:25.842
I planted it.

09:25.876 --> 09:27.410
What?
Why?

09:27.428 --> 09:29.763
To escape the curse
of the middle-aged actress.

09:29.797 --> 09:32.582
Instead of losing a push-up
contest to Julie Bowen

09:32.600 --> 09:34.968
to see who gets to play
Kevin James's mean wife

09:35.019 --> 09:36.586
who he's sick of having sex with,

09:36.604 --> 09:38.138
I'm gonna skip ahead to being

09:38.189 --> 09:40.940
an amazing slut who wins Oscars.

09:40.975 --> 09:42.692
I mean, how hot is Helen Mirren?

09:42.726 --> 09:45.366
Super-hot. I mean, have you seen
that picture of her in a bikini?

09:45.367 --> 09:46.429
She looks amazing for...

09:46.447 --> 09:48.198
Exactly...
"For."

09:48.232 --> 09:51.601
She looks amazing
for a 67-year-old.

09:51.619 --> 09:53.069
She's actually not that hot.

09:53.103 --> 09:54.704
She's got a gut and British legs.

09:54.738 --> 09:55.738
All right, settle down.

09:55.772 --> 09:56.772
Well, now we know.

09:56.791 --> 09:58.575
It won't happen again.

09:58.609 --> 10:00.410
What if it's too late, Liz?

10:00.444 --> 10:02.124
I'm in the running for an endorsement deal

10:02.125 --> 10:03.246
with Geri-Chair,

10:03.280 --> 10:05.448
America's number one
motorized stair climber.

10:05.466 --> 10:06.633
I know Geri-Chair.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.467
They're the company
that makes my bed steps.

10:08.468 --> 10:10.670
You better not have
messed this up for me, Liz.

10:10.721 --> 10:15.925
Because I will take them out.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.127
I'm scared, but it tickles.

10:22.633 --> 10:23.733
I am aware of this.

10:23.767 --> 10:25.768
Zarina is
great-escaping me,

10:25.802 --> 10:27.353
and of course, I'm fine with it.

10:27.404 --> 10:30.139
Really? Because I've seen that
look on your face before.

10:30.157 --> 10:31.458
When Jack Welch called you Rick.

10:31.492 --> 10:32.859
And I was fine with that too.

10:32.910 --> 10:34.744
I mean, he and I had met only, like,

10:34.778 --> 10:36.996
<i>a million</i> times,
so why should he remember me.

10:37.031 --> 10:39.032
Maybe I should meet these other men

10:39.083 --> 10:40.316
in Zarina's Pokemon.

10:40.334 --> 10:41.651
No, bad idea.

10:41.669 --> 10:42.869
There are no bad ideas, Lemon,

10:42.870 --> 10:44.954
only great ideas that go horribly wrong.

10:44.988 --> 10:48.258
Look, when no conceivable good
can come of something,

10:48.292 --> 10:49.459
don't engage.

10:49.493 --> 10:51.053
I would love to keep arguing with Tracy

10:51.054 --> 10:52.974
about whether women
are funnier than monkeys...

10:52.996 --> 10:56.516
I once saw a monkey in a cowboy outfit.

10:56.550 --> 10:58.184
I would love to see the town

10:58.219 --> 10:59.335
he's the sheriff of.

10:59.353 --> 11:01.604
The point is, why do I
care what Tracy thinks?

11:01.639 --> 11:03.273
I don't, 'cause I know the truth.

11:03.307 --> 11:04.641
Women are just as funny as men,

11:04.675 --> 11:06.025
and you know the truth too.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.143
I do.

11:07.177 --> 11:08.511
I am the complete package.

11:08.529 --> 11:10.897
I don't need to know
what one thing I give Zarina.

11:10.948 --> 11:12.181
I mean, who cares?

11:12.199 --> 11:13.316
- Not me.
- Great.

11:13.350 --> 11:14.617
So we're not engaging.

11:14.652 --> 11:15.851
This is growth, Jack.

11:15.870 --> 11:17.287
And we are gonna celebrate

11:17.321 --> 11:19.455
by going to a brunch place
and talking about

11:19.490 --> 11:21.324
my new sex-positive
lifestyle.

11:21.358 --> 11:22.408
Absolutely not.

11:22.459 --> 11:23.576
We did it in the shower.

11:23.627 --> 11:25.161
My shoes got ruined.

11:25.195 --> 11:28.331
I said no!

11:28.365 --> 11:29.999
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

11:30.033 --> 11:32.802
I had to pick my friend up
from the train station.

11:32.836 --> 11:36.172
Say hello, Professor Wigglebottom!

11:36.206 --> 11:39.058
That dude's awesome.

11:39.093 --> 11:40.810
See how he's wearing clothes?

11:40.844 --> 11:41.877
And he's got a suitcase

11:41.896 --> 11:43.563
like he's going on a business trip.

11:43.597 --> 11:45.515
Why's he being so professional?

11:45.549 --> 11:46.849
We should put him on the show!

11:46.883 --> 11:48.351
He could play a young Steven Tyler.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.054
He looks like me if I were fancy.

11:52.072 --> 11:53.656
See, Liz?

11:53.691 --> 11:55.191
Everyone's laughing!

11:55.225 --> 11:57.527
Because there are things
that are just funny.

11:57.561 --> 11:59.529
Like monkeys, the three stooges,

11:59.563 --> 12:00.563
and me!

12:02.750 --> 12:04.367
And some things just aren't.

12:04.401 --> 12:07.203
Like females, and listing only two things.

12:07.237 --> 12:10.590
I'd like to see Lucille Ball
do this on TV!

12:10.624 --> 12:12.625
Male nipples, funny.

12:12.676 --> 12:14.010
Monkey nipples, funny.

12:14.044 --> 12:16.212
Female nipples, useless!

12:16.246 --> 12:18.464
Engaging!

12:18.515 --> 12:19.682
All right, that's it!

12:19.717 --> 12:21.157
I will prove to you once and for all

12:21.158 --> 12:22.758
that women are just as funny as monkeys.

12:22.770 --> 12:24.771
Jenna and I
are re-mounting

12:24.805 --> 12:28.524
our award-winning 1996
two-woman show.

12:28.559 --> 12:31.728
Right here, 4:00 P.M.,
mandatory.

12:43.874 --> 12:45.158
"Thinking of you, sweetie.

12:45.192 --> 12:48.110
"X-O, Zarina."

12:48.128 --> 12:49.945
"Sweetie."

12:49.964 --> 12:53.750
Why didn't she write,
"thinking of you, Jackie-bear?"

12:53.784 --> 12:57.670
She could have
written this... to anyone.

12:57.721 --> 12:59.756
Jonathan, get me a young person.

12:59.790 --> 13:01.891
Who has a social life.

13:01.925 --> 13:03.459
It's a group email, isn't it?

13:03.477 --> 13:05.795
This woman is pokemoning me.

13:05.813 --> 13:06.796
She's blind-copied you,

13:06.814 --> 13:09.949
but if you just click this plus sign...

13:09.984 --> 13:12.802
Yep.
There's the whole group.

13:12.820 --> 13:16.189
<i>Hip420@brooklyn. Beard,</i>

13:16.223 --> 13:20.276
"ryunloktee"... misspelled...
@swimteam.org,

13:20.310 --> 13:24.347
<i>kentremendous@fremulon. Biz</i>...

13:24.381 --> 13:27.083
<i>Totalpackage58</i>...
Wait, that's me.

13:27.117 --> 13:29.836
I don't care if it takes all day.

13:29.870 --> 13:34.123
I want you to teach me how to
copy all of those email addresses

13:34.157 --> 13:38.378
and paste them into a new email.

13:38.429 --> 13:40.797
No, I understand.

13:40.831 --> 13:42.751
You'll let me know
when you've made a decision.

13:42.752 --> 13:46.185
But... okay, bye.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.670
How's it going, friendy?

13:47.688 --> 13:50.273
Well, that was Gerald Chair,

13:50.307 --> 13:51.641
the inventor of
the Geri-Chair.

13:51.675 --> 13:53.810
They're leaning towards Jamie Lee Curtis.

13:53.844 --> 13:56.229
She already beat me out for Activia,

13:56.280 --> 13:58.180
and cold flash menopause popsicles.

13:58.198 --> 14:00.316
Well, this might not be

14:00.350 --> 14:01.851
the best timing, but...

14:01.869 --> 14:03.319
- I need a favor.
- Yeah.

14:03.353 --> 14:05.688
Today's the day when I'm gonna
do my first favor ever.

14:05.706 --> 14:06.873
This isn't a favor for me,

14:06.907 --> 14:09.358
it's a favor for all women.

14:09.376 --> 14:11.160
We are gonna prove Tracy wrong...

14:11.194 --> 14:12.495
- Bored.
- And show him

14:12.529 --> 14:14.196
how funny women are.

14:14.214 --> 14:15.915
- Are we, though?
- By...

14:15.966 --> 14:18.968
Re-staging our old show.

14:19.002 --> 14:21.087
Our old show.

14:25.809 --> 14:27.593
Are you thinking, or doing kegels?

14:27.644 --> 14:30.680
Yes. Let's do it.

14:30.714 --> 14:32.482
But we have to do the doctor sketch,

14:32.516 --> 14:34.049
the one where I'm a little girl.

14:34.068 --> 14:35.184
Sure.
Absolutely.

14:35.218 --> 14:37.018
And thank you for being
a friend about this.

14:37.019 --> 14:38.521
Yes, friend.

14:38.555 --> 14:40.490
I mean, yes...

14:40.524 --> 14:42.608
Friend.

14:44.945 --> 14:46.345
Thank you for coming in, gentlemen.

14:46.346 --> 14:48.948
I look forward to discovering
exactly what each of you

14:48.999 --> 14:51.284
has to offer Zarina that I do not.

14:51.335 --> 14:53.536
I know she has a sex idiot

14:53.570 --> 14:55.237
for uninhibited experimentation.

14:55.255 --> 14:56.956
No, I'm pretty sure we're in love.

14:57.007 --> 14:58.687
A filthy hippie to make her feel bohemian.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.543
I get it, I can't give her that.

15:00.577 --> 15:02.017
Someone to make her parents angry...

15:02.045 --> 15:04.013
Man, is that all I am to her?

15:04.047 --> 15:05.364
It's 2012.

15:05.399 --> 15:07.967
Sorry, Norbert.
The truth hurts.

15:08.018 --> 15:09.018
Interesting.

15:09.052 --> 15:10.753
A mean wall street type.

15:10.787 --> 15:12.955
I would have thoughtht I was
the money guy.

15:12.973 --> 15:14.123
So what does that make me?

15:14.141 --> 15:16.426
Just the perfect head of hair?

15:16.460 --> 15:20.313
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Heavenly father.

15:20.347 --> 15:22.181
You must be Ken tremendous.

15:22.232 --> 15:23.349
I don't understand.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.664
What am I doing here?

15:24.690 --> 15:27.879
We've covered all the classic
boyfriend archetypes.

15:27.905 --> 15:30.356
Except the father figure.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.774
Where is that guy, am I right?

15:31.808 --> 15:34.944
The one who falls asleep
at the opera, and doesn't notice

15:34.978 --> 15:37.813
that she's texting
her real boyfriend from his bed.

15:37.831 --> 15:40.616
Where's that sucker?

15:42.786 --> 15:44.921
No...
Is it me?

15:54.910 --> 15:57.445
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you are about to see

15:57.496 --> 16:00.698
is a classic sketch from the Chicago area

16:00.732 --> 16:03.084
piven-nominated
two-woman show,

16:03.118 --> 16:04.201
<i>Maroney and Lemon.</i>

16:04.235 --> 16:08.038
I take you now to this...

16:08.072 --> 16:11.058
Doctor's office.

16:11.093 --> 16:13.544
Doctor, I'm unhappy

16:13.578 --> 16:15.296
with me widdle body.

16:15.347 --> 16:16.380
Can you help me?

16:16.414 --> 16:17.915
Well, of course.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.601
Toddler plastic surgery is
an exciting new field.

16:20.635 --> 16:23.387

17:01.292 --> 17:03.227
Thanks, Frank.

17:03.261 --> 17:06.096
Elizabeth Q. Lemonade,
I owe you an apology.

17:06.130 --> 17:07.297
That skit was funny.

17:07.315 --> 17:08.598
Like, monkey funny.

17:08.633 --> 17:10.935
Thanks.
That means a lot, Tracy.

17:10.969 --> 17:12.809
When you were, like,
"come in, I'm a doctor,"

17:12.810 --> 17:13.810
- Yeah.
- And you had on

17:13.810 --> 17:16.190
that lab coat, like a doctor.

17:16.241 --> 17:18.943
A lady doctor...
My God,

17:18.977 --> 17:20.277
that is hilarious!

17:20.310 --> 17:22.151
Really? That's what you
thought the joke was,

17:22.152 --> 17:23.580
there's a female doctor?

17:23.615 --> 17:25.031
Yeah.
And Jenna,

17:25.083 --> 17:28.335
you as that sad old prostitute
trying to look young...

17:28.369 --> 17:29.670
Commentary!

17:29.704 --> 17:32.506
Old?
Thank you, Tracy.

17:32.541 --> 17:33.901
That's the only reason I did this.

17:33.925 --> 17:36.760
And it was spectacular!

17:36.795 --> 17:39.180
Gerald!
You came!

17:39.214 --> 17:41.215
You bet I did, baby.

17:41.266 --> 17:43.934
There's nothing older
than trying to be young.

17:43.969 --> 17:46.670
And you looked like
a million years up there.

17:46.688 --> 17:48.189
Congratulations.

17:48.223 --> 17:49.940
You are Geri-Chair's

17:49.975 --> 17:53.176
new spokes-crone!

17:53.195 --> 17:54.695
Lolo Jones, a man couldn't even do

17:54.729 --> 17:55.846
that doctor sketch.

17:55.864 --> 17:57.448
We would've just been sitting there

17:57.482 --> 17:59.850
listening to his medical advice.

17:59.868 --> 18:01.485
You were right, Liz Lemon.

18:01.519 --> 18:04.290
Women can be funny.

18:06.324 --> 18:08.158
You know what?
I'll take it.

18:08.192 --> 18:10.744
Stride of pride.

18:21.389 --> 18:22.389
Jenna?

18:22.424 --> 18:24.875
Jack, I'm sorry.

18:24.893 --> 18:26.893
I didn't think anyone
would be up here this late.

18:26.894 --> 18:28.596
Sometimes, I like to come up here at night

18:28.641 --> 18:30.681
and flash my breasts
at the empire state building.

18:30.715 --> 18:32.650
Is that the only building that you flash?

18:32.684 --> 18:35.603
Or do you also flash
the Time Warner center

18:35.654 --> 18:37.021
to make the Empire State Building

18:37.055 --> 18:38.439
feel like an old fool.

18:38.490 --> 18:40.274
Are you all right, Jack?

18:40.325 --> 18:42.893
You look like that flash card
they told me means sadness.

18:42.911 --> 18:45.913
I have to break it off
with a woman I'm seeing.

18:45.947 --> 18:48.365
I found out I'm just an aging squirtle

18:48.399 --> 18:50.751
in her Pokemon.

18:50.785 --> 18:53.254
That's tough.

18:53.288 --> 18:55.072
Accepting the way other people see us

18:55.090 --> 18:56.590
can be difficult.

18:56.625 --> 18:59.543
I mean, inside,
I still feel like a sex idiot.

18:59.577 --> 19:03.213
But I have to accept the fact
that I'm fake 56 now,

19:03.247 --> 19:05.916
and I'm more of a Diane Lane
ageless beauty.

19:05.934 --> 19:08.636
But don't fight it, embrace it.

19:08.687 --> 19:09.753
Look.

19:09.771 --> 19:11.855
Do you really want this girl asking you

19:11.890 --> 19:13.891
to go hear her friend DJ in Brooklyn?

19:13.925 --> 19:15.476
No, that sounds exhausting.

19:15.527 --> 19:17.111
Do you want to drive five hours

19:17.145 --> 19:18.595
to go rock climbing with her,

19:18.613 --> 19:20.364
and be expected to have sex after?

19:20.398 --> 19:22.265
I do not.
I mean, my back.

19:22.284 --> 19:23.433
So don't break up with her.

19:23.451 --> 19:25.486
Just be the older person.

19:25.537 --> 19:26.737
It's fun.

19:26.771 --> 19:29.106
You get to say racist stuff
whenever you want,

19:29.124 --> 19:31.492
and people bring you soup.

19:31.543 --> 19:34.444
I do like soup.

19:40.168 --> 19:43.470
Okay, so maybe I never
got my <i>Sex and the city</i> brunch.

19:43.505 --> 19:45.622
And maybe I never got to share the fact

19:45.640 --> 19:48.458
that I now know
four different sexual positions,

19:48.476 --> 19:50.728
one of which involves a chair.

19:50.762 --> 19:54.014
But maybe a good relationship
is more than that, anyway.

19:54.065 --> 19:58.135
All this talk of great-escaping
and pokemons got me thinking.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.469
Is accepting who you are

19:59.487 --> 20:01.588
the secret to getting what you want?

20:01.623 --> 20:02.639
Action!

20:02.657 --> 20:04.474
Geri-Chair makes it safe

20:04.492 --> 20:06.309
for me to spend Christmas alone.

20:06.328 --> 20:09.663
Do men and women really
see the world so differently?

20:09.698 --> 20:12.983
Or can we agree that we're all
just monkeys with suitcases

20:13.001 --> 20:14.618
trying to seem like people?

20:14.652 --> 20:16.453
Well played, Professor.

20:18.506 --> 20:20.541
Wait...
You're a female?

20:20.592 --> 20:23.877
How you doin', girl?

20:23.928 --> 20:27.047
Can we get everything
we need from one person?

20:27.098 --> 20:28.882
Or is that what friends are for,

20:28.933 --> 20:31.635
to be the allied P.O.W.'s

20:31.669 --> 20:33.670
and whimsical Japanese
mini-creatures

20:33.688 --> 20:35.923
that help us get through life?

20:35.957 --> 20:38.225
Now, this is how people danced

20:38.276 --> 20:40.394
before Chubby Checker ruined everything.

20:40.445 --> 20:43.063
I guess what I'm saying is

20:43.114 --> 20:45.449
I need to modify my zappos order,

20:45.483 --> 20:48.518
so please email me back
at your earliest convenience.

20:54.074 --> 20:55.908
Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers,

20:56.339 --> 20:58.356
Gilda Radner, Lucille ball,

20:58.358 --> 21:01.893
Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin.

21:01.895 --> 21:03.194
Yes, thank you, Tracy.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.762
Those are all very funny women.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.030
Funny women?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.392
Those are the names of my fingers.

21:07.393 --> 21:09.400
Irma Bombeck, Tig Notaro...

21:09.402 --> 21:13.571
Is my impression of a Chinese person.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.072
Wait! Hold on!

21:15.074 --> 21:17.792
Ellen DeGeneres, Mo'nique,
and Roseanne Barr.

21:17.794 --> 21:19.827
Now that's some funny women.

21:19.829 --> 21:21.329
All of whom have screamed at me

21:21.331 --> 21:24.365
because they were on their period.
