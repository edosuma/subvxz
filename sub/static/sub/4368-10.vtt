<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

04:25.065 --> 04:27.011
I read that it works this way.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.313
That the therapist waits until
the silence becomes so unbearable

04:31.471 --> 04:34.008
that the patient
is forced to speak.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.189
It can work any way
you want, Mr. Wren.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.293
Is there something particular
you'd like to talk about?

04:42.449 --> 04:45.987
- Grief. I'd like to talk about grief.
- Of course.

04:46.153 --> 04:49.100
I want to know how it works,
if it has a purpose.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.463
That's a big question.

04:51.625 --> 04:56.040
It might be best if we talk about
your specific circumstances.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.374
Have you lost someone?

05:03.470 --> 05:06.041
My closest friend. There was
an accident. I was with him.

05:06.206 --> 05:09.119
I'm very sorry, Mr. Wren.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.882
Do you have someone
to comfort you during this time?

05:13.847 --> 05:16.555
I was in a relationship,
but that's over now.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.890
The emotional fallout
from these types of traumas

05:20.053 --> 05:22.329
can be extensive.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.663
Which brings us
to your question, grief.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.737
Whether it has a purpose.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.898
An evolutionary purpose.

05:31.064 --> 05:36.571
I mean, I find myself reevaluating
choices that I've made.

05:37.904 --> 05:42.011
Things that I should have
done differently or better.

05:43.243 --> 05:46.156
As if in losing everything,
I finally understand.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.025
But then it occurs to me that...

05:52.185 --> 05:55.530
It occurs to you that
this feeling might be temporary.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.900
There's a false sense of lucidity
that often accompanies grieving.

06:02.762 --> 06:06.107
I've been thinking
about doing something radical...

06:07.100 --> 06:09.410
...as a tribute to his memory.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.345
I would caution
against that, Mr. Wren.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.951
I see this so often.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.054
I've been working with the survivors

06:17.210 --> 06:20.282
of the ferry bombing
earlier this year.

06:20.447 --> 06:23.223
Their trauma is similar to yours.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.624
More extreme, of course.

06:25.785 --> 06:30.461
Many of them experience a sense
of responsibility for what happened.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.467
Survivor's guilt, I'm familiar.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.607
Well, then you're also familiar
with what I'm about to say next.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.872
That you think your friends death
was your fault.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.245
Otherwise, you'd have to face
a very painful truth.

06:46.606 --> 06:50.110
- Which is what?
- That you are not God.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.655
<i>You don't control who lives or dies.</i>

06:53.647 --> 06:55.285
That powerlessness also means

06:55.448 --> 06:58.156
that your friend's death
is not your fault.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.627
I assure you, Mr. Wren...

07:02.923 --> 07:06.996
...in time,
the guilt you feel will pass.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.778
Let me ask you a question then.

07:16.736 --> 07:20.445
Does survivor's guilt pass

07:20.607 --> 07:24.817
when everything that has happened
actually is, in fact, your fault?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.371
You look tired, Harold.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.544
Please talk to me.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.877
I have nothing to say, Ms. Groves.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.044
I offered before.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.522
Let me help you.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.886
It's a little too late for that,
don't you think?

08:06.886 --> 08:08.559
Not for John.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.464
He's in trouble. I can tell
by the look on your face.

08:14.794 --> 08:19.004
And I don't want to sound
unsympathetic, Harold,

08:21.067 --> 08:24.514
but we have
much bigger problems at hand.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.811
Whatever your machine
was trying to prepare me for...

08:29.909 --> 08:31.252
...it's coming.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.338
<i>- Yes, Detective?
- We got a big problem.</i>

08:50.730 --> 08:53.336
<i>Break it down into a 50-footer.
You can roll it up.</i>

08:53.500 --> 08:54.945
<i>You heard him, Eddie?</i>

08:58.038 --> 08:59.779
I heard the call on the radio.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.943
Someone t-boned him then interrogated
him while their car burned.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.190
Guys in the from might make it.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.587
Guy in the back might make
a good bag of charcoal.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.053
Witnesses put our pal,

09:12.218 --> 09:14.391
the psychopathic vigilante,
at the scene.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.862
Which one?

09:17.957 --> 09:20.460
You mean both your stray dogs
are off the leash?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.242
This was the handiwork
of tall, dark, and deranged.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.639
And I shudder to think
what the other one's up to.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.803
I have reason to believe
that one or both of them

09:29.969 --> 09:32.813
are looking to track down
and kill Simmons.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.248
We all want Simmons.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.945
Piece of crap killed my partner,
then went after my kid.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.318
But the scorched earth campaign
is only going to make

09:40.480 --> 09:42.323
Simmons harder to find,
not easier.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.151
Who were they?

09:46.619 --> 09:48.121
Dirtbags of the highest order.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.291
Run drugs, underage hookers.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.400
And a lot of paper.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.665
Paper?
- Yeah, counterfeit bills.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.810
IDs, passports,
for a forger named Yorke.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.575
We'd better find Mr. Yorke then.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.317
Hey, get me down.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.622
Come on.

10:23.690 --> 10:27.365
Take me down, you bitch!
I told you everything I know.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.865
And somehow,
I just don't believe you.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.708
Hey! Hey, hey.
Hey, guys, call the cops!

10:38.204 --> 10:40.946
You want to take a crack at him?
My gun hands cramping.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.446
Guy's not looking so good.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.886
- Did you break his legs?
- Nope. Reese did.

10:49.048 --> 10:50.049
Got to him before I did.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.025
Dropped him off the roof
of the building.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.462
I found his sorry ass
in the parking lot yelling for help.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.999
Still got his arms, though.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.636
Did you see Reese?

11:00.627 --> 11:01.970
Gone by the time I got here.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.404
- We have to stop him.
- Why?

11:04.564 --> 11:07.408
One less dirty cop-killing cop
sounds good to me.

11:07.567 --> 11:11.344
Setting aside your somewhat
binary moral compass, Ms. Shaw,

11:11.504 --> 11:14.485
you should know that Mr. Reese's
injuries are life-threatening.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.088
All right, Harold.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.585
We'll play it your way.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.318
But if Reese
doesn't want to be found,

11:23.483 --> 11:26.657
our only way of tracking him
is by finding Simmons ourselves.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.224
Guy give you anything?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.390
Speak up!

11:30.557 --> 11:35.563
The only one who knows Simmons'
exit strategy is his boss, Quinn.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.106
And if you're looking for him,
get in line.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.238
Everybody wants him dead.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.678
Can I go to the hospital now, please?

11:42.835 --> 11:44.337
You got an inside track to the feds?

11:44.504 --> 11:46.245
We got to get to Quinn
before Reese does.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.046
Are you kidding?
Quinn ran a bunch of corrupt cops.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.347
Feds aren't talking to me.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.615
I know one man who will know
Quinn's location.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.851
After his arrest,
Quinn retained Jimmy Ransone,

11:56.015 --> 11:59.258
high-dollar criminal defense attorney
with a questionable reputation.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.957
And even suspects in protection
are allowed to see their lawyer.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.033
Wait a minute, come on, guys!
Get me down!

12:05.191 --> 12:07.296
Aw, come on,
get me the hell out of here!

12:14.801 --> 12:16.803
<i>I'd say our boy's come and gone.</i>

12:20.974 --> 12:22.214
Finch?

12:23.643 --> 12:25.088
We got a problem.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.488
You couldn't find Mr. Ransone?

12:27.647 --> 12:28.819
<i>We found what's left of him.</i>

12:28.982 --> 12:32.156
Someone used him as an ashtray before
putting a bullet in his head.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.895
Reese has really gone
off the reservation this time.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.323
No.
Reese doesn't even smoke.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.336
He would have just used a lighter.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.269
This is theatrical.
Amateur hour.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.144
Well, at least we know
he's still alive.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.149
<i>How badly is he injured, Ms. Shaw?</i>

12:58.177 --> 13:00.919
<i>He doesn't look so good.
We don't have much time.</i>

13:05.251 --> 13:06.971
Reese leaves,
and five minutes later,

13:06.995 --> 13:08.596
these jokers show up.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.032
Russians.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.200
It figures.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.838
Quinn turned state evidence
against them.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.201
So now both Mr. Reese
and the Russians

13:17.363 --> 13:20.708
know where to find Alonzo Quinn,
and we still don't.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.037
Ransone is the only one that
can tell us where Reese is going.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.211
Not the only one.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.043
Who?

13:28.207 --> 13:29.777
<i>Harold knows who I'm talking about.</i>

13:29.942 --> 13:31.114
We're out of options.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.389
We need Root.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.861
<i>We need to discuss the Loftin case.</i>

13:49.329 --> 13:51.707
Caucasian male, 83,
presented with acute pneumonia.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.741
I know the case, Dr. Shaw.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.238
I also know about your interaction
with the Loftin family.

13:58.137 --> 14:01.584
You walked into the waiting room
eating an energy bar

14:02.475 --> 14:05.752
and proceeded to tell the Loftin
family that their father was dead.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.255
Because he was.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.825
And, presumably, you were hungry.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.929
You managed to revive
Mr. Loftin four times.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.894
<i>You went to truly heroic
measures to save their father,</i>

14:18.057 --> 14:20.765
and yet, all the Loftin family
will remember

14:20.927 --> 14:24.033
is the doctor who gave them
the worst possible news

14:24.197 --> 14:26.507
while she was eating a candy bar.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.906
Let me ask you this.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.343
Do you care if your patients
live or die?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.545
Of course.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.447
But does it hurt you?

14:35.608 --> 14:38.418
I've been watching you
for some time,

14:38.578 --> 14:40.524
and it doesn't seem to bother you.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.224
This place is filled

14:44.384 --> 14:48.230
with doctors who don't care
if their patients live or die.

14:48.388 --> 14:52.598
No, this place is filled with doctors
who pretend they don't care.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.472
But you're different.
Aren't you?

14:58.464 --> 15:00.740
Your attendings all say
the same thing about you,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.641
technically brilliant.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.475
Remarkably calm.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.044
They can't spot what you really are.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.553
And what's that?

15:11.377 --> 15:15.086
You know the DSM backwards
and forwards, Doctor.

15:15.214 --> 15:17.956
You probably diagnosed
yourself in your first year.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.826
A diagnosis which meant that you

15:21.988 --> 15:25.162
never should have been
accepted into this program.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.669
I watch the others.
I watch the fear creep into them.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.000
I watch them make mistakes,

15:30.163 --> 15:34.578
and you think these feelings
that I'm lacking make them better?

15:34.734 --> 15:38.079
You'd really rather have one of them
working on you instead of me?

15:38.237 --> 15:40.911
Yes.
Because if...

15:42.275 --> 15:46.087
If the only thing motivating you
is technical mastery,

15:46.245 --> 15:50.193
when one of your patients
needs you the most,

15:50.349 --> 15:54.024
then this job just
might start to bore you.

15:54.854 --> 15:58.996
That's the difference
between fixing and healing.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.036
You have a brilliant mind, Sameen.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.271
And you're very gifted.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.445
But you'll never be a doctor.

16:18.878 --> 16:19.878
<i>Time's up, Harold.</i>

16:20.046 --> 16:22.246
<i>This is not something
we should go about lightly.</i>

16:22.348 --> 16:23.554
It's the only way.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.219
There will be larger consequences
if we make this decision.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.545
We need to be ready for that.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.927
John isn't going to make it
if he winds up in a crossfire

16:30.056 --> 16:33.560
between a bunch of feds and organized
criminals in his current state.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.637
I know this is
our only option, Ms. Shaw.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.571
I just want to make sure we're
prepared for what may happen.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.072
I'm in.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.571
Are you?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.733
I'm guessing that isn't for me.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.458
If you told me about
the carpooling arrangements,

17:34.620 --> 17:36.122
I would have driven separately.

17:36.289 --> 17:40.396
Ms. Groves is here
to help us locate Alonzo Quinn.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.473
We're close.
Turn off the headlights.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.272
How am I supposed to see?

17:50.536 --> 17:52.209
You don't need to.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.088
Steady for another 800 feet.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.590
Adjust left when you feel it.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.564
Feel what?

18:10.489 --> 18:12.093
Harold, grab the first aid kit

18:12.258 --> 18:14.329
when we get
out of the car, will you?

18:14.493 --> 18:15.597
Pull over to the right.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.444
Tell me why we're listening to the
crazy chick who kidnapped Glasses.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.113
In your right pocket,
you have 85 cents.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.520
The change from
your morning coffee run.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.525
In your apartment,
there's an old photo of your father

18:38.684 --> 18:41.324
at the Franklin Park Zoo
taken when he was a child.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.665
He's feeding a lion cub.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.194
Do you know
what that cub's name was?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.932
Lionel.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.341
That's where your name came from.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.307
I promise I'm here to help.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.660
Just when I think life with you people
couldn't get any weirder,

19:03.684 --> 19:05.453
one of you takes it
to the next level.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.284
Where are we, Ms. Groves?

19:07.446 --> 19:09.050
May I have a gun now?

19:09.215 --> 19:11.627
What's with you
and your poor listening skills?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.388
No way.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.054
Then you better turn around.

19:17.456 --> 19:18.901
Unh!

19:20.226 --> 19:21.637
Follow me.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.234
And bring him with you.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.911
You just shot a federal marshal.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.912
Just between us,
not my first time.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.329
Wait for the light at 12:00.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.761
Is that...

19:55.928 --> 19:57.771
Alonzo Quinn.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.113
The building has two main exits,
two emergency exits.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.080
Twelve US Marshals guard the building,
plus our friend over there

20:07.239 --> 20:09.845
who was scouting the perimeter
that we're now inside.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.615
Air support is ten minutes out.

20:12.778 --> 20:16.419
While the Russians aren't here yet,
they will be soon.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.220
You sure the big guy's here?

20:23.856 --> 20:27.599
What the hell was that?
Move in! Get CRT on standby.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.234
Pretty sure.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.882
<i>Your test scores are good,
but I have my doubts about you.</i>

20:41.974 --> 20:44.079
You look soft to me.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.586
Sir, no.
No, sir.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.921
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Stop with the "Sirs." You're green.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.552
From the soles of your feet
to the top of your pointy head.

20:53.719 --> 20:54.720
I'm sorry.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.493
Were you expecting me
to ask about your feelings?

20:57.656 --> 21:00.967
'Cause you're about to join men
living out on the ragged edge

21:01.127 --> 21:02.970
where extreme actions are required

21:03.129 --> 21:06.406
to stop extremely bad things
from happening.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.010
Are you prepared
to do terrible things?

21:09.168 --> 21:11.079
And then turn it off
when you need to?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.677
Yes, sir.
I am.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.287
Could you kill a terrorist
standing two feet from his young son?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.991
Blow his head off
and then walk away

21:21.147 --> 21:23.991
while the kid cries next
to his daddy's dead body?

21:24.850 --> 21:26.955
If those are my orders, sir.

21:28.287 --> 21:32.963
Says here your dad died
when you were just a kid.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.638
Army man too.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.842
You're not gonna decide
at the wrong time

21:41.000 --> 21:45.506
that a child should have a father,
even if that father is a terrorist?

21:49.708 --> 21:51.187
No, sir.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.686
I'm sorry for going
at you like this, son,

21:55.848 --> 21:59.295
but I'm the last stop between you
and the darkness that awaits you.

21:59.451 --> 22:02.864
I need to be sure you're mentally
tough enough for this program.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.865
If you spun out,
got your brothers killed,

22:05.024 --> 22:06.731
it would be on me.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.735
Well, you're just doing your job.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.664
I get it.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.243
I've been through this before.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.377
No one does this twice.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.586
If you washed out, we wouldn't
have recruited you again.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.380
I didn't wash out.

22:25.544 --> 22:28.081
<i>I've been a part
of this program for three years.</i>

22:29.148 --> 22:30.923
A very trusted part.

22:32.751 --> 22:35.061
In fact, my CO tasked me
with finding out

22:35.221 --> 22:37.223
who's been selling the names
of our operatives

22:37.389 --> 22:39.391
to Chinese counterintelligence.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.736
Took me a while,
but I found him.

22:50.402 --> 22:52.609
If only you'd just done your job.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.085
You're pretty damn good at it.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.870
Who the hell pays for the damage?

23:14.026 --> 23:15.562
Get back inside now.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.140
I'm radioing Pollack.
We need air support.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.900
Get in. Get in.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.442
<i>Sir, are you seeing this?</i>

23:23.602 --> 23:25.275
<i>Do we need to call for air support?</i>

23:25.437 --> 23:27.383
It's a car fire in Queens.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.143
I'm not calling air support for that.

23:29.308 --> 23:32.255
Rapid response team
standing by on the second floor.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.789
Have your men do
a perimeter check and report back.

23:34.947 --> 23:35.948
Copy that.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.459
Russians, feds. I don't care.
I just want to know.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.097
Who pays for the... damage?

23:50.829 --> 23:53.241
You should probably call for backup.

23:53.399 --> 23:56.642
You worried some of your old buddies
came to shoot the breeze?

23:56.802 --> 23:58.611
Sadly, my men are very good
at their jobs.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.009
Anybody wants a crack at you,
they're gonna need an entire...

24:02.174 --> 24:03.676
<i>Sir. Sir, we've got a situation.</i>

24:05.477 --> 24:07.081
Robbins is down,
and the hotel doors

24:07.246 --> 24:08.953
have been secured from the inside.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.354
<i>Someone's in there with you.</i>

24:15.821 --> 24:17.459
Secure the door.
Now.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.361
Ready Team, this is Highlight.

24:20.526 --> 24:21.869
<i>Spread out to the stairwells.</i>

24:22.027 --> 24:24.303
<i>No one gets to three.
Expect multiple shooters.</i>

24:24.463 --> 24:26.374
Copy that.
We'll lock it down.

24:27.099 --> 24:30.376
Secure the hallways.
We're taking the prisoner out, now.

24:31.437 --> 24:33.883
Looks like I underestimated
your popularity.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.541
Let's move.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.483
No point.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.816
The guy who's coming after me...

24:41.880 --> 24:43.860
Your men won't be able
to stop him.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.584
Move, move!

25:19.184 --> 25:20.686
<i>Wait a second.</i>

25:28.060 --> 25:31.007
<i>On my mark, move.
Go, go!</i>

25:33.599 --> 25:35.101
<i>Team Two, report.
Report.</i>

25:55.554 --> 25:57.795
I made three shooters, maybe four.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.026
On my count.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.761
Three, two...

26:15.374 --> 26:16.717
I'm sorry.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.048
But I need a word
with the man you're protecting.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.987
You just attacked a dozen marshals.

26:22.147 --> 26:23.387
Sony's not gonna cut it.

26:23.549 --> 26:26.996
They'll need some aspirin, maybe
a little physical therapy. Move.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.462
You sit this one out.

26:57.483 --> 26:58.860
Simmons.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.122
I want his exit.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.202
Loyalty-

27:08.760 --> 27:11.036
That's why Simmons
came after you and Carter.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.168
Loyalty.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.039
That's how we built
this whole damn thing.

27:17.703 --> 27:21.549
I'll be damned if I repay
that loyalty by breaking it now.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.877
Even if you threaten to kill me.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.649
You see?

27:31.550 --> 27:33.894
That's why you and I
understand each other.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.691
Now, everything you do
is an abomination.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.395
But your word...

27:43.829 --> 27:45.809
Your word is your bond.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.969
To your godson.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.904
To Carter.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.484
You do what you say.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.653
So do I.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.155
I'm not going to
threaten to kill you.

28:07.753 --> 28:11.428
I'm going to kill you
whether you tell me or not.

28:12.758 --> 28:14.499
No bargaining.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.565
In three minutes...

28:18.096 --> 28:19.234
...you're dead.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.744
I've killed many people.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.250
Never bothered me much.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.620
That's why I was good at it.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.621
I didn't like them suffering, though.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.730
Took me years to figure out
how to do it quickly, painlessly.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.426
But if you don't tell me,

28:46.592 --> 28:49.471
I'm going to forget all of that.
Understand?

28:52.698 --> 28:57.875
And I'll make the last three minutes
of your life last forever.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.798
May I please have a gun now?

29:18.056 --> 29:20.900
No, and you're really starting
to irritate me by asking.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.266
As far as Root's request
for a weapon, Ms. Shaw,

29:23.428 --> 29:25.635
the situation is becoming
increasingly dangerous.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.902
- Yeah, no kidding!
- And if she wanted to kill us,

29:28.066 --> 29:30.478
I'm guessing she could have
done so many times already.

29:31.503 --> 29:33.176
Speak for yourself, Harold.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.682
But fine. Whatever.
Take it.

29:36.341 --> 29:38.184
Can I have a second one, please?

29:38.343 --> 29:41.153
Two guns at once?
That's kinda lame.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.750
You all set?
Let's head up.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.253
Too late.

29:46.184 --> 29:47.822
Where's she going?

30:11.476 --> 30:12.648
Okay, that was kinda hot.

30:12.811 --> 30:13.812
I'll watch the front.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.016
You should head up.
We're running out of time.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.581
Time's up.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.917
Mr. Reese.

30:45.877 --> 30:49.689
You know what Joss sacrificed
to bring this man down on her terms.

30:50.549 --> 30:51.926
Legal terms.

30:54.152 --> 30:55.893
Everything.

30:56.054 --> 30:57.226
Yes.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.925
So if you're going
to kill Mr. Quinn,

30:59.091 --> 31:00.931
don't imagine that you're
doing it in her name.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.903
That's not what
she would have wanted.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.240
We should have killed him
in the first place.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.106
Why didn't we, Finch?

31:16.942 --> 31:18.387
That's not our purpose.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.423
We save lives.
You save lives.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.221
Not all of them.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.621
You're dying, John.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.231
Let us help you.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.868
No!

31:43.468 --> 31:44.708
Let's get him out of here.

31:47.305 --> 31:48.716
I'll stay and make sure the feds

31:48.874 --> 31:50.979
take this piece of garbage
back into custody.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.318
We should be going after Simmons.

32:00.485 --> 32:01.657
Reese got his location.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.993
Sometimes you have to make
choices, Ms. Shaw.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.398
We've already lost a friend.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.938
I don't intend to lose another,
not tonight.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.405
I can't believe
we're going to let him get away.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.566
The Machine never said
Reese was the only one

32:14.800 --> 32:16.404
planning to kill Simmons.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.179
Let's get you out of here.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.868
<i>We've been talking
for nearly 20 minutes, Lionel,</i>

32:50.035 --> 32:52.208
but you've said almost nothing.

32:53.872 --> 32:56.148
And I thought we were
really starting to hit it off.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.310
Look, this is a safe place.

32:59.044 --> 33:02.389
I may get paid by the city,
but I serve the police officers

33:02.547 --> 33:03.821
who come into my office.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.519
Oh, yeah? In that case,
I'll take a bourbon and rocks.

33:07.953 --> 33:12.231
Alcohol abuse is common
among officers after a shooting.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.398
So is sarcasm.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.972
How have you been sleeping
since the incident?

33:18.129 --> 33:19.403
Just fine.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.738
You were forced
to take someone's life.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.916
That's a hard pill lo swallow,

33:27.005 --> 33:29.007
even when the shooting
was justified.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.218
Fine.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.419
- I encountered the suspect...
- It's better if you use his name.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.927
Okay.
I encountered Jules.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.497
It was dark, he saw me,
went for his piece.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.899
I got to mine first.
The end.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.605
Well, that must have been terrifying.
You could have been killed.

33:53.431 --> 33:54.876
Part of the job.

33:56.935 --> 34:02.783
Yeah, well, pan of my job,
Lionel, is dealing with cops

34:02.941 --> 34:06.684
who act tough and end up eating
a bullet because of a cascade

34:06.845 --> 34:09.382
of untreated posttraumatic symptoms.

34:10.514 --> 34:14.121
Now, you can hide your real feelings
from everyone else,

34:14.286 --> 34:17.027
but with me,
you need to get real.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.194
All right.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.963
This is a safe place, right?

34:24.596 --> 34:27.270
Doctor-patient, confidential,
all that, right?

34:27.431 --> 34:30.879
Yes, everything you say here
is completely protected.

34:31.036 --> 34:33.447
Use this time to unburden yourself.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.250
Wasn't a good shooting.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.156
Well, I'm sure you may
feel that way, but...

34:43.315 --> 34:45.090
Ain't got anything
to do with feelings.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.123
You see, Jules shot
an off-duty rookie last year.

34:50.288 --> 34:51.824
Twenty-four years old.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.100
Kid had a baby on the way.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.232
But good drug dealers
can afford good lawyers,

34:58.396 --> 35:00.171
so Jules walked.

35:00.665 --> 35:05.011
I had been tracking him for weeks,
just waiting to get the guy alone.

35:06.838 --> 35:11.344
And there he was,
walking out of a bodega,

35:11.509 --> 35:13.352
with not a care in the world.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.354
No protection either.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.625
He saw me.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.698
He knew why I was there.
I could see it in his eyes.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.030
So I smiled at him.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.205
Just before I put two in his chest.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.345
You killed a man.

35:36.501 --> 35:37.536
No.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.148
- He got the devil's share.
- The what?

35:42.540 --> 35:45.544
That's what you call it
when a guy like Jules gets his.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.883
It's the way the world
evens things out.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.150
Guy got what he deserved,

35:51.316 --> 35:53.728
and you want to know
how I've been sleeping?

35:53.885 --> 35:55.387
Like a baby.

35:56.554 --> 35:59.057
But thanks for letting me
unburden myself.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.856
Missed your flight.

36:33.058 --> 36:35.231
I told the pilot
you weren't going to make it.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.202
So what's the plan, Fusco?

36:40.865 --> 36:43.004
Going to shoot an unarmed man?

36:45.270 --> 36:46.408
Nah.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.715
I got a better idea.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.512
Been waiting to do this
for a longtime.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.206
Carter got you good, huh?

37:52.570 --> 37:53.947
I get it, Fusco.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.320
I always knew you were a killer.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.153
Get it over with, will ya?

38:03.014 --> 38:04.459
That's just it.

38:06.684 --> 38:08.857
I could've been just like you,

38:09.020 --> 38:11.500
a bottom-feeder
who turns on his own kind.

38:12.657 --> 38:15.365
For what?
Money, power?

38:16.661 --> 38:18.140
I got lucky.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.673
I had a partner.

38:24.702 --> 38:26.375
She was good for me.

38:27.205 --> 38:28.479
For a lot of reasons.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.789
She reminded me that
I could be good again too.

38:34.512 --> 38:37.152
I could be a good father,
a good friend.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.318
A good cop.

38:43.388 --> 38:46.028
I'm not going to let you
undo all the good she did.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.130
Carter saved my life.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.477
She saved me from myself.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.072
Because she believed in me.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.095
And I'm not going to throw all that away
on a piece of crap like you.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.356
Patrick Simmons,
you're under arrest.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.195
You have the right to remain silent.

39:17.388 --> 39:18.389
<i>Anything you say...</i>

39:43.448 --> 39:45.428
Doctor said he's going to pull through.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.527
Lost a lot of blood.

39:50.188 --> 39:52.566
I'm going to go steal some more
from Manhattan General.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.632
Where's Root?

40:19.651 --> 40:21.824
Think he's finally warming up to me.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.499
You were free.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.569
Why did you come back?

40:28.393 --> 40:32.000
Like I said, we have
a larger fight ahead of us.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.576
I think we should be together
when that begins.

40:37.468 --> 40:38.468
Don't you?

40:45.677 --> 40:47.020
Thank you.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.339
<i>Dr. Sandler to nurse's station.</i>

41:10.635 --> 41:13.115
<i>Dr. Sandler to nurse's station.</i>

41:26.050 --> 41:27.552
It's just me, officer.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.525
Elias.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.301
What do you want?

41:36.461 --> 41:38.338
Quinn and I are busted.

41:39.297 --> 41:40.799
HR is dead.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.378
Nothing else to do
but rub my face in it.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.912
That's not really my style.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.008
Then why the hell are you here?

41:51.042 --> 41:53.522
Well, there remains a debt.

41:54.979 --> 41:58.426
Civilization rests on the principle
that we treat our criminals better

41:58.583 --> 42:02.690
than they treated their victims,
that we not stoop to their level.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.694
But you and I are outliers.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.768
We're not really
a part of civilization.

42:07.925 --> 42:11.429
We're something... older.

42:13.698 --> 42:14.699
Which means, of course,

42:14.899 --> 42:17.937
that we can do the things
that civilized people can't.

42:18.903 --> 42:21.611
I offered to kill you for
Detective Carter many times,

42:21.773 --> 42:23.616
and she always said no.

42:23.741 --> 42:26.221
She was civilized
to the very end.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.523
I don't think she liked me.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.559
But I liked her very much.
You killed her.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.896
So now I consider it
my responsibility

42:37.055 --> 42:40.264
to fix the particular problem
that is you, Officer Simmons.

42:42.193 --> 42:45.402
You really think you're
going to be the one to kill me?

42:45.596 --> 42:46.596
No!

42:46.597 --> 42:48.873
No, my friend
is going to kill you.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.742
I'm just going to watch.
