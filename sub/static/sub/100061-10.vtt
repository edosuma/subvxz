I mean, there's nothing going on
here that we can't handle.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.221
Let us know if you
need anything, all right?

09:30.265 --> 09:32.006
Thanks. Will do.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.355
All right, pal.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.402
Junior, how we doing
connecting these victims?

09:37.446 --> 09:39.622
Uh, yeah, well, I checked
their cell records,

09:39.666 --> 09:42.756
and three nights ago, um,
Jon, our photographer,

09:42.799 --> 09:44.192
placed a call
to the other two vics.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.976
Oh, well, there you go.
We have them connected.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.326
Yeah, but the strange thing
is, there's no history

09:48.370 --> 09:50.154
of them ever calling
each other before that.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.200
And I cross-checked
their phone records

09:52.243 --> 09:54.811
as far back as I could--
we're talking about years here--

09:54.855 --> 09:56.770
and there's still nothing.That is weird.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.293
How long did the calls last for?

09:58.336 --> 09:59.729
Uh, just a couple of minutes.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.296
Uh, long enough
to set up a meet.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.559
Because that same night
the calls were made,

10:03.603 --> 10:05.648
Jon's credit card
showed up a charge

10:05.692 --> 10:07.824
at a dive bar
in Waipahu.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.652
I sent the bartender
a photo of our vics,

10:09.696 --> 10:11.175
and he confirms
that the three of them

10:11.219 --> 10:12.960
sat at a table
for a few rounds.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.701
Okay. Hey, guys, what's up?

10:14.744 --> 10:16.441
So, we have
established

10:16.485 --> 10:18.661
that our victims
knew each other.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.184
We do not know how or why

10:20.228 --> 10:22.752
somebody would want
to kill them.
Yeah.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.188
But we got ourselves
a suspect.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.408
At least for one
of the victims.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.975
TANI: Seems that
Makaio Keahi's

10:28.018 --> 10:29.759
boat business was struggling.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.543
In fact, he had
just filed a lawsuit

10:31.587 --> 10:34.982
against his main competitor,
Brian DiSalva.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.418
DiSalva recently
upgraded his fleet,

10:36.461 --> 10:38.725
and ever since then, Makaio's
numbers have plummeted.

10:38.768 --> 10:42.467
I didn't know you could
sue someone for that.Oh, this is America.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.252
I could sue Lou here
for wearing that shirt.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.428
Yeah, you could, but
even if a judge had

10:46.471 --> 10:49.431
absolutely no fashion sense,
he'd just toss the case.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.389
Well, it sounds like
Makaio's case was

10:51.433 --> 10:53.130
just as ridiculous.
I spoke to the arbitrator

10:53.174 --> 10:54.784
who was trying
to close the case.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.439
She says that Makaio
allegedly sent over

10:57.482 --> 11:00.398
a bunch of thugs over to
one of DiSalva's boats

11:00.442 --> 11:02.444
to try to sabotage it.
And, apparently, last week,

11:02.487 --> 11:04.402
DiSalva said he's
threatening to retaliate.

11:04.446 --> 11:07.318
I guess we need to talk
to Mr. DiSalva.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.711
If I'm being honest,

11:08.755 --> 11:11.061
doesn't surprise me
someone killed Makaio.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.934
That dude had a unique ability
to get under your skin.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.413
Sure was making
my life miserable.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.285
GROVER:
Do you suppose
that this man

11:17.328 --> 11:18.329
realizes that he just

11:18.373 --> 11:19.679
gave us a motive

11:19.722 --> 11:21.289
for him to commit mur...

11:21.332 --> 11:23.421
You really ain't
too bright, are you?

11:23.465 --> 11:25.293
I mean, first, you start
off by threatening the guy

11:25.336 --> 11:27.251
in front of an arbitrator.
That's right.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.600
We-we know all about that.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.733
Who do you think
you're talking to?[scoffs]

11:30.777 --> 11:33.214
I said that I would break
a-a stern light, maybe,

11:33.257 --> 11:34.302
not kill the guy.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.347
Look, genius,

11:36.391 --> 11:39.176
Makaio's wife said that
he drove his car back

11:39.220 --> 11:40.961
from the docks last night
without incident,

11:41.004 --> 11:43.920
meaning that his brake line
was tampered with before dawn.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.443
GROVER:
So, where were you

11:45.487 --> 11:47.445
between the hours of
11:00 p.m. last night

11:47.489 --> 11:50.361
and 6:30 a.m. on
this fine morning?

11:50.405 --> 11:51.754
I was with my girlfriend
at the movies,

11:51.798 --> 11:54.626
and then we came back
to my place and went to sleep.

11:54.670 --> 11:55.932
All right, then, Casanova.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.499
We're gonna go check
your story out.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.414
But it's gonna be
a while, so...

11:59.457 --> 12:01.416
enjoy your surroundings.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.505
This is perfect, really.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.376
Makaio's dead,
and he's still messing with me.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.508
You know what the worst part is?

12:06.551 --> 12:08.771
I gave him a job
when he was struggling.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.338
You'd think that would count
for something.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.295
Hold on.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.428
Makaio used to work for you?

12:13.471 --> 12:15.778
About ten years ago, yeah.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.432
He was in bad shape then--
living in his car,

12:17.475 --> 12:19.303
stringing together random jobs.

12:19.347 --> 12:22.654
I let him sleep on my boat,
work it off as a deckhand.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.482
He was grateful till he wasn't.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.223
And what changed?

12:26.267 --> 12:27.311
He came into money.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.704
A lot, as far as
I could tell.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.314
Next thing I know,
he's bought his own boat,

12:30.358 --> 12:32.316
and he's working
as my competition.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.058
I don't suppose you have
any idea where that windfall

12:35.102 --> 12:37.365
came from, do you?I asked him.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.846
More than once.
He never gave a straight answer.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.852
Did a deep dive into the
financial history of our vics.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.506
Makaio wasn't the only one
to come into a pile of money

12:48.550 --> 12:51.379
ten years ago,
because at the same time, Jon

12:51.422 --> 12:53.294
put a down payment
on a condo.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.948
I spoke to Pekelo's
business partner.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.558
She said that he opened
his first restaurant--

12:56.601 --> 12:58.255
you guessed it-- ten years ago.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.257
They all got some kind
of payday at the same time.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.129
GROVER:
Yeah, but you wouldn't know it
by their bank accounts.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.913
According to
some old bank statements,

13:03.957 --> 13:06.350
all of them had nearly nothing
in their accounts.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.744
Which means that their big score
likely came in the form of cash.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.399
They had to have got that
cash illegally, right?

13:11.442 --> 13:13.444
Well, seems to me like whatever
they were involved in back then

13:13.488 --> 13:14.576
finally caught up with them.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.360
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.798
We got to figure out
where the cash came from.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.845
Hey. Was surprised to
get your call, man.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.021

You got any intel,
or am I taking my money back?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.482
All right. They call themselves
the Pinoy Playas. Okay?

13:51.526 --> 13:52.875
They just showed up on the
island a few months ago

13:52.919 --> 13:54.659
looking to get a piece
of the fentanyl trade.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.836
Which the yakuza has locked up.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.621
Right. Me, I'm a free

see it that way.

up to ten years ago.

We know that Makaio worked
for DiSalva as a deckhand.

other odd jobs:

of criminal activity.

even remotely connected

16:47.745 --> 16:50.400

then and now

16:50.444 --> 16:53.360
is Jon's apparent interest
in prisoner advocacy.

to the head of the organization.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.850
He told me that Jon

17:05.894 --> 17:07.722

ten years ago.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.570

He'll know where
they're keeping her.

myself clear.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.150
You were not to get involved!

19:11.193 --> 19:12.499
I was careful.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.588
They have no idea this has
anything to do with you.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.372
And if they figure it out? Huh?

19:16.416 --> 19:18.026

Your actions have placed
my daughter in great danger

When?

19:27.427 --> 19:29.603
Tonight.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.605
They guaranteed they will
release her unharmed.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.084
And you believe them?

19:33.128 --> 19:35.130
Yes.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.828
With respect, Masuda-san,

19:37.872 --> 19:39.526
Tamiko was innocent
in all this.

19:39.569 --> 19:40.918
That didn't stop them
from taking her,

19:40.962 --> 19:43.356
from nearly killing me.
These are not honorable men.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.488
How can you take them
at their word?Because...

19:47.011 --> 19:49.666
Because I'm giving them
exactly what they want.

it's your life for hers.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.347
A small price
for Tamiko's return.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.131
No. Small price?

20:20.175 --> 20:22.873
Masuda-san, there
must be another way.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.486
This way poses the least risk.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.575
It's a father's sacrifice.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.359

You don't trust the
cops or the system.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.824
But this man... he's been
in your corner for years.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.305
I've never seen
that guy before in my life.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.698
What's this about?

21:04.741 --> 21:07.135
You heard of
the Innocent Walk Foundation?

21:08.179 --> 21:10.443
This guy's name is Jon Kalama.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.315
He's been
privately bankrolling

21:13.359 --> 21:15.665
an effort to get you
out of this place.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.493
And this morning,
he was murdered.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.929
I don't understand.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.671
Mr. Maliah, the man you
were convicted of killing,

21:21.715 --> 21:23.717
Cameron Winston--
you worked for him?

21:23.760 --> 21:26.067
I did landscaping for him.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.069
And when he stiffed me
on a payment,

21:28.112 --> 21:29.636
I admit we got into it.

21:29.679 --> 21:30.898
Things got physical.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.682
I put my hands on him.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.118
But you didn't kill him.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.946
No. Someone did, though.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.166
That same night
in the same room we argued in.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.603
I mean, your DNA, your prints
were all over that crime scene.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.649
You know that, right?Yes, they were.

21:42.692 --> 21:45.565
But since he was holding
some fancy party that night,

21:45.608 --> 21:47.567
meaning dressed up
rich people only,

21:47.610 --> 21:49.873
there was no way
I could've moved in and out

21:49.917 --> 21:52.833
without nobody seeing me,
which nobody did.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.487
Because you weren't there?

21:54.530 --> 21:55.923
No, ma'am, I was not.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.359
That's the truth,

21:57.403 --> 21:59.796
which don't matter unless
the right people believe it.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.625
But the clocks ran out,
so now they never will.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.279
What? What are you
talking about?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.586
My final appeal was denied.

22:06.629 --> 22:08.239
Just came down last week.

22:08.283 --> 22:10.503
So I'm in here
for the long haul.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.331
The toughest part
is knowing I'll never get

22:12.374 --> 22:13.636
to see my little girl again.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.595
Miss that little kid
like crazy, though.

22:15.638 --> 22:19.425
I'd write her a letter if
I knew where they were living.

22:19.468 --> 22:20.817
The fact that
she's out there,

22:20.861 --> 22:22.993
growing up...

22:24.560 --> 22:26.127
...and I'm gonna miss
her whole life.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.523
It's torture, bro!

22:33.917 --> 22:35.658
I don't get a guilty read
off that guy.

22:35.702 --> 22:38.487
I mean, after all these years,
denying it as loud as though he

22:38.531 --> 22:39.619
just got cuffed.
In my experience,

22:39.662 --> 22:40.837
people like that are either

22:40.881 --> 22:42.491
innocent or delusional,

22:42.535 --> 22:44.406
and he does not seem
like a crazy person to me.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.713
Let's assume Maliah
is telling the truth.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.976
Maybe that's
why Jon Kalama

22:49.019 --> 22:50.760
was supporting
his appeals process.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.849
Because he knows
the guy didn't do it.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.068
How do you figure?

22:54.111 --> 22:55.939
I don't know.
Maybe Jon did it himself.

22:55.983 --> 22:58.507
Maybe he's the killer
or he knows who did it.[phone ringing]

22:58.551 --> 23:00.596

You got me and Quinn.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.425

23:04.731 --> 23:06.689
of that banker
from ten years ago.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.865
Guess who HPD interviewed
right at the scene.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.867
Please tell me it was
one of our victims.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.521
Try all three.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.437
They were all working various
kinds of service jobs that night

23:15.481 --> 23:16.873
at some swanky fundraiser.

23:16.917 --> 23:19.310
Pekelo was a busboy,
Jon was working valet,

23:19.354 --> 23:21.095
and Makaio was tending bar.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.879
They were all suspects
at the time?

23:22.923 --> 23:25.142
No, actually,
forensics cleared them.

23:25.186 --> 23:27.231
The only reason
they were even in the file is

23:27.275 --> 23:28.885
because they all
made statements.

23:28.929 --> 23:32.411
And each one of them told
the cops, "Didn't see a thing."

23:32.454 --> 23:33.977
Yeah, they could've
lied to the cops.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.936
I mean, maybe they all
witnessed the murder.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.504
Yeah, if the killer was
a high-society, rich,

23:38.547 --> 23:40.636
two-hour-lunch-on-Tuesday type,
it's not hard to believe

23:40.680 --> 23:42.508
they would pay
big bucks for silence.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.771
All right, I can see that.
I mean, that would

23:44.814 --> 23:46.599
explain where all
that cash came from.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.731
Question is:
Why kill them now?

23:48.775 --> 23:51.125
We just found out that
Roger Maliah's final

23:51.168 --> 23:53.344
appeal process was denied.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.782
Now, Jon was bankrolling
those appeals.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.479
I mean, what if
that is the thing

23:57.523 --> 23:58.698
that tipped him over the edge?

23:58.741 --> 24:00.526
What if that was
the final piece?

24:00.569 --> 24:02.223
The guilt got too much,
you know?

24:02.266 --> 24:03.833
So Jon reached out to the others

24:03.877 --> 24:05.400
with that phone call
three days ago.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.054
He said it was time
to come clean

24:07.097 --> 24:08.359
and name the real guilty party.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.144
Maybe.

24:10.187 --> 24:13.190
Look, if I was the killer
and I found out about that plan,

24:13.234 --> 24:15.715
those would be the three voices
I'd want to silence.

24:15.758 --> 24:18.065
We need to find out who
did this murder and fast.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.719
Because the way it looks now,

24:19.762 --> 24:21.677

three more people.

Mr. Winston's head in.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.028
That's not a denial.

39:39.072 --> 39:40.856
Your crackpot theory
doesn't rate one.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.118
Oh, no?

39:42.162 --> 39:43.903
Because it all
checks out to me.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.687
There's no way
your trusted mob doctor

39:45.731 --> 39:48.168
would test the slugs
that killed the boss.

39:48.211 --> 39:51.258
But King's Hospital?
That means a proper autopsy.

39:51.301 --> 39:54.304
And what do you think
they would've found, huh?

39:54.348 --> 39:56.045
I don't know.

39:56.089 --> 39:59.309
Maybe, just maybe those slugs
would've matched to your gun.

39:59.353 --> 40:00.963
Next, you're
gonna tell me

40:01.007 --> 40:03.226
I coordinated Tamiko's
kidnapping with the Filipinos.

40:03.270 --> 40:04.706
Did you?

40:06.012 --> 40:07.317
That is what
got Masuda

40:07.361 --> 40:09.450
to hand you
the keys to the yakuza.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.365
Pretty convenient
for you

40:11.409 --> 40:15.325
that the only people who could
confirm this are now dead.

40:15.369 --> 40:18.633
It's late. I know you have
an errand to run for Tamiko.

40:18.677 --> 40:21.897
Why don't we finish our business
before you leave?

40:30.515 --> 40:33.082
ADAM:
Kenji. Wait, wait.

40:33.126 --> 40:34.388
You don't have to do this.

40:36.216 --> 40:37.957
You abducted this man,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.394
brought him here,

40:40.438 --> 40:43.397
traded off with me as we beat
the information out of him.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.182
I believe it was your enthusiasm

40:46.226 --> 40:48.750
that got him to reveal
the details of the drop.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.361
And now you've grown
a conscience?

40:51.405 --> 40:54.887
I'm not saying
what I did can be excused,

40:54.930 --> 40:57.411
but I did it for a reason.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.544
To bring Tamiko home.

40:59.587 --> 41:02.372
But this, Kenji, this,

41:02.416 --> 41:03.548
this is
cold-blooded murder.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.201
There's no purpose to it.

41:05.245 --> 41:08.074
Staying out of prison
is the purpose.

41:08.117 --> 41:10.598
What do you
expect me to do?

41:10.642 --> 41:13.035
Let you turn him over
to the authorities?

41:13.079 --> 41:14.472
I won't let this man

41:14.515 --> 41:17.779
and the stories that he can tell
cause trouble for me.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.651
And the same
goes for you.

41:21.696 --> 41:24.482
I will make sure the authorities
find out about your role

41:24.525 --> 41:27.441
in everything
that took place tonight.

41:27.485 --> 41:31.271
And your career with Five-O
will be over.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.099
Are we clear?

41:34.448 --> 41:35.884
Kenji, don't.
Don't, don't, don't!

41:35.928 --> 41:37.320
No!

41:52.466 --> 41:54.468
[phone ringing]

42:05.218 --> 42:07.133
Uh...

42:12.181 --> 42:13.966
Hey, Steve.

42:14.009 --> 42:16.142
Hey, Adam,
how you feeling, pal? Better?

42:16.185 --> 42:19.275
Yeah, much better. Thank you.

42:19.319 --> 42:22.017
Uh, I'll see you first thing
tomorrow morning.

42:22.061 --> 42:23.323
If you're up for it,
I'd actually like

42:23.366 --> 42:24.803
to see you at HQ now.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.718
Right now?

42:26.761 --> 42:28.589
Yeah. That work for you?

42:30.373 --> 42:33.115
Yeah.

42:33.159 --> 42:36.075
I'm on my way.

42:36.118 --> 42:37.424
