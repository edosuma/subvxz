WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:04.904
CARLA: Hey, Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.904 --> 00:06.906
Afternoon, Woody!

00:06.906 --> 00:08.408
Oh, hiya, Mr. Twitchell.

00:08.408 --> 00:09.909
If it isn't Walter Q. Twitchell,

00:09.909 --> 00:11.911
the man who put the "nie" in weenie.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.916
You South Central Branch types

00:16.916 --> 00:18.918
are all alike--
wisenheimers.

00:18.918 --> 00:21.337
Good Lord, Miss Agnes!

00:23.339 --> 00:25.341
You're wearing your postal keychain

00:25.341 --> 00:27.343
and you're not on active duty?

00:27.343 --> 00:28.344
Well...

00:28.344 --> 00:29.846
That's a direct violation

00:29.846 --> 00:30.847
of postal regulations.

00:30.847 --> 00:32.348
I'm filing a report on you.

00:32.348 --> 00:33.850
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

00:33.850 --> 00:35.351
I'd love to see the supervisor's face

00:35.351 --> 00:36.853
when he calls me out on the mat

00:36.853 --> 00:38.354
and I whip out this little baby.

00:38.354 --> 00:39.856
Heh? Care to take a peep

00:39.856 --> 00:41.725
at the old French peeper here, Twitch?

00:41.725 --> 00:46.196
I warn ya, it's, uh, pretty hot stuff.

00:51.701 --> 00:53.703
You're a sick man, Clavin.

00:57.707 --> 01:00.210
(all laughing)

01:00.210 --> 01:02.212
What are you...?

01:02.212 --> 01:04.214
Oh, nice shiner there, Twitch.

01:05.715 --> 01:07.634
Yeah, they could never pass up

01:07.634 --> 01:10.136
a chance to sneak a peek
at Natalie in her nightie.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.138
TWITCHELL: Nightie?!

01:12.138 --> 01:13.640
Wasn't wearing anything I could see.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.642
Huh?

01:15.642 --> 01:17.644
TWITCHELL: Revenge is sweet.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.645
Here's your mail.

01:18.645 --> 01:19.646
Have a nice...

01:21.981 --> 01:25.401
(piano plays)

01:25.401 --> 01:27.854
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:27.854 --> 01:30.857
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:30.857 --> 01:33.860
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:33.860 --> 01:36.863
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:36.863 --> 01:42.252
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:42.252 --> 01:45.038
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:45.038 --> 01:50.043
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:50.043 --> 01:55.048
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.050
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:57.050 --> 02:00.053
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:00.053 --> 02:05.058
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:05.058 --> 02:08.061
? You want to go where people know ?

02:08.061 --> 02:10.062
? People are all the same ?

02:10.062 --> 02:15.068
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:34.053 --> 02:35.555
(sighs)

02:39.559 --> 02:41.060
(sighs)

02:43.563 --> 02:48.067
Are you developing a slow leak, Diane?

02:48.067 --> 02:49.068
No.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.070
I have a problem.

02:51.070 --> 02:53.072
I just don't know who to talk to.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.574
Oh.

02:54.574 --> 02:55.575
Well, how about me?

02:55.575 --> 02:59.078
I don't think that would
be appropriate in this case.

02:59.078 --> 03:00.580
You see, it's a romantic problem.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.081
Oh.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.083
Considering our past, I don't think

03:04.083 --> 03:06.586
you could possibly
maintain your objectivity.

03:06.586 --> 03:07.587
Oh, come on.

03:07.587 --> 03:08.588
Give it a shot.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.292
Very well.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.626
As you know, last week,

03:13.626 --> 03:16.129
I was substituting as
a teaching assistant

03:16.129 --> 03:18.131
at the college and...

03:18.131 --> 03:20.133
it seems that one of the students

03:20.133 --> 03:21.384
has fallen in love with me.

03:21.384 --> 03:22.719
Marry him. See!

03:26.222 --> 03:28.725
Sam,

03:28.725 --> 03:32.228
in this case, the smitten youth
is particularly good-looking.

03:32.228 --> 03:33.112
Ah.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.981
No, make that

03:34.981 --> 03:36.482
exceptionally good-looking.

03:36.482 --> 03:37.367
All right.

03:37.367 --> 03:40.737
No, make it
Greek-god-like.

03:40.737 --> 03:43.239
The problem is that he's very persistent

03:43.239 --> 03:47.744
and with his beauty and youthful ardor,

03:47.744 --> 03:50.630
I find myself inexplicably

03:50.630 --> 03:51.497
drawn to him.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.999
He's asked me out several times.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.501
Now, I don't want to encourage him,

03:55.501 --> 03:58.922
but on the other hand, I'm tempted.

03:58.922 --> 04:00.423
What do you think I should do, Sam?

04:00.423 --> 04:02.926
I'm sorry. I got sidetracked there.

04:02.926 --> 04:05.812
I was looking at my foot.

04:09.098 --> 04:10.099
Sam, please.

04:10.099 --> 04:12.602
As you know, I'm one who prides herself

04:12.602 --> 04:16.990
on her attraction to the inner man,

04:16.990 --> 04:18.241
but every once in awhile,

04:18.241 --> 04:21.110
someone comes along that
makes you go, "zowie."

04:21.110 --> 04:22.495
Oh, stop it, will ya?

04:22.495 --> 04:24.864
You're just trying to make me jealous.

04:24.864 --> 04:28.117
Your being jealous was the
farthest thing from my mind...

04:29.085 --> 04:30.086
...although,

04:30.586 --> 04:31.587
now that you bring it up,

04:31.587 --> 04:34.090
any sane man would be jealous
of Lance Apollonaire.

04:34.590 --> 04:35.341
Oh, come on.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.626
If you're gonna make a guy up,

04:36.626 --> 04:37.627
at least give him a name

04:37.627 --> 04:39.629
that doesn't sound
like a bad aftershave.

04:41.597 --> 04:44.550
I knew it was a mistake to talk to you.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.937
I'll just have to deal
with this on my own.

04:47.937 --> 04:50.223
Rest assured, though,
that the last thing I need

04:50.223 --> 04:52.725
is to become that young
man's "Mrs. Robinson."

04:52.725 --> 04:55.728
Wouldn't that be Mrs. Apollonaire?

04:55.728 --> 04:58.231
No, Woody.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.734
Mrs. Robinson was a... Yes, it would.

05:04.654 --> 05:06.656
Well, top of the day, everybody,

05:06.656 --> 05:09.158
and what a fine day it is, too, huh?

05:09.158 --> 05:10.660
Why the good spirits, Mr. Clavin?

05:10.660 --> 05:11.661
Well, uh, you guys ever hear

05:11.661 --> 05:13.546
of the Knights of the Scimitar?

05:13.546 --> 05:15.298
Yeah, it's one of those lodges, right?

05:15.798 --> 05:17.300
The lodge, Sammy.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.301
You know, it's always,

05:18.301 --> 05:20.303
uh, been a dream of
mine to become a member.

05:20.303 --> 05:21.754
Well, yesterday, I made it.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.639
You guys are looking at a Knight.

05:23.639 --> 05:24.891
Hey, that's great, man.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.809
Thanks... Thank you.
Thank you very much.

05:26.809 --> 05:28.811
You know, uh, Dad himself was a Knight.

05:28.811 --> 05:31.314
When I was a kid, I used
to sneak up into his room

05:31.314 --> 05:34.817
when he was out at work and,
uh, try on his turban and sword.

05:34.817 --> 05:36.319
And unless I miss my guess,

05:36.319 --> 05:37.320
you completed the outfit

05:37.320 --> 05:39.822
with your mother's bra and high heels.

05:42.325 --> 05:44.827
Carla, this is serious.

05:44.827 --> 05:46.829
It's no easy task
getting into the Knights.

05:46.829 --> 05:48.698
Oh, sure, as the son
of an alumnus, I was,

05:48.698 --> 05:50.199
uh, guaranteed full membership,

05:50.700 --> 05:54.203
but, uh, well, hey, my oath does
not permit me to say any more.

05:54.203 --> 05:55.204
Thank God.

05:55.204 --> 05:56.205
Yeah.

05:56.205 --> 05:57.707
But the best part is...

05:57.707 --> 05:59.709
Your oath, Clavin, your oath.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.210
No, no, this stuff's permissible, Carla.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.212
Oh, shut up, anyway.

06:03.212 --> 06:05.715
Well, oh, well, so don't listen!

06:05.715 --> 06:07.216
Hey, look, uh, listen, you guys.

06:07.216 --> 06:09.719
The best part is that, uh,
you know, now that I'm a member,

06:09.719 --> 06:11.220
I can get all you guys in.

06:11.220 --> 06:12.722
Huh? You know,

06:12.722 --> 06:14.891
of course it's gonna
have to be one at a time.

06:14.891 --> 06:17.226
Now, uh, I figured out a fair
way to do the choosing, okay?

06:17.226 --> 06:19.112
Now I'm thinking of a number

06:19.112 --> 06:20.113
between one and ten.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.564
Whoever has the closest wins.

06:21.564 --> 06:24.567
Uh, Norm, you first.

06:24.567 --> 06:28.321
Two million and 12.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.156
Two million 13.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.743
Two million 14.

06:33.743 --> 06:35.578
Well, the number was four.

06:35.578 --> 06:38.081
Norm's closest with two million 12.

06:39.582 --> 06:41.084
Darn! I was gonna say four.

06:41.084 --> 06:43.586
I shoulda stuck with my first instinct.

06:46.089 --> 06:47.090
Cliffy, uh, thanks a lot,

06:47.090 --> 06:48.591
but I-I'm just not interested.

06:48.591 --> 06:50.593
You know, I guess I'm an example

06:50.593 --> 06:53.096
of the old adage, "I'd never join a club

06:53.096 --> 06:54.597
that would have someone like you

06:54.597 --> 06:56.099
as a member," you know?

06:56.099 --> 06:57.100
That's great.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.102
Hey, Normie, Normie,
you know, the Knights,

06:59.102 --> 07:00.103
they got a lot of, uh, you know,

07:00.103 --> 07:01.604
bankers, lawyers, and assorted

07:01.604 --> 07:02.605
captains of industry down there.

07:02.605 --> 07:04.107
Yeah, so?

07:04.107 --> 07:06.109
Well, so, they're
gonna need accountants,

07:06.109 --> 07:07.110
and, uh, God knows

07:07.110 --> 07:08.611
you could use a few clients.

07:08.611 --> 07:09.612
Yeah, I've heard those places

07:09.612 --> 07:11.114
are great for making contacts.

07:11.114 --> 07:12.115
Yeah.

07:12.115 --> 07:14.117
My business has been down just a bit

07:14.117 --> 07:15.118
this past year.

07:15.118 --> 07:16.119
There you go.

07:16.119 --> 07:18.121
Woody, give me the horn, will ya?

07:18.121 --> 07:19.622
Oh, boy. Hey,

07:19.622 --> 07:22.041
you're gonna love it down
at the lodge, you know.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.043
After a hard day's work,
it's a great place to unwind.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.545
Yeah, wearing those turbans,

07:25.545 --> 07:27.213
you probably need a place to unwind.

07:30.099 --> 07:31.601
You know, unwind.

07:32.101 --> 07:34.103
(laughs)

07:34.103 --> 07:35.104
Turbans?

07:35.104 --> 07:37.106
How they're all wound
up around your head

07:37.106 --> 07:38.107
and you gotta unwind 'em?

07:38.107 --> 07:41.027
Hey, uh... good one, Woody.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.531
I was voted class clown.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.400
You should be proud.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.902
Yeah, I was only running
for class president.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.328
Oh, Diane, will you do me a favor

07:59.328 --> 08:00.830
and run up and get some change

08:00.830 --> 08:01.831
from Melville's, please?

08:01.831 --> 08:03.332
Oh.

08:08.337 --> 08:10.339
What, what are you doing?

08:10.339 --> 08:12.842
Lance is definitely taller than you are.

08:14.810 --> 08:17.230
For a while there, I
thought you were taller,

08:17.230 --> 08:18.731
but I see why I was mistaken.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.733
Your shoulders are less broad,

08:20.733 --> 08:24.737
thus giving you
the illusion of greater height.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.740
I promised not to bring up

08:27.740 --> 08:30.109
this Adonis-like
creature, didn't I? Sorry.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.578
No, no, hey, don't be sorry
about a little fantasy.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.080
I mean, I'm not sorry about the fantasy

08:34.080 --> 08:35.581
I had a couple of hours ago.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.082
By the way, how many nurses

08:37.082 --> 08:40.586
do you think can fit in
a standard-size hot tub?

08:43.589 --> 08:47.460
Sam, I assure you, Lance is not a fantasy,

08:47.460 --> 08:49.929
and the feelings he inspires

08:49.929 --> 08:51.430
are very real, too.

08:51.430 --> 08:52.932
Change.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.935
Not for you or any man.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.303
No, no, Diane.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.272
Change: Nickels, dimes, quarters.

09:04.894 --> 09:06.395
Can I ask you a question here, Carla?

09:06.395 --> 09:08.397
Mm-hmm.

09:08.397 --> 09:11.400
Who's the handsomest man you know?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.401
Robert Redford.

09:13.903 --> 09:14.904
No, no, he's a movie star.

09:14.904 --> 09:16.405
I mean someone you really know.

09:16.405 --> 09:17.406
Robert Redford.

09:18.407 --> 09:19.909
You don't know Robert Redford.

09:19.909 --> 09:22.411
Yes, I do.

09:22.411 --> 09:23.913
How come you never mentioned it?

09:23.913 --> 09:25.915
If you were the only woman in Boston

09:25.915 --> 09:29.418
he was messing around with,
would you tell anybody?

09:32.421 --> 09:34.423
Okay, all right, besides Robert Redford.

09:34.423 --> 09:36.926
I mean, some... somebody
you see in the city here.

09:36.926 --> 09:38.928
Who's the handsomest
guy you see in the city?

09:39.428 --> 09:40.930
Um, Dwight Evans.

09:41.931 --> 09:44.934
No, not-not an athlete.

09:44.934 --> 09:46.936
Somebody that you see every day.

09:46.936 --> 09:47.937
My butcher.

09:47.937 --> 09:50.940
In this bar, Carla.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.441
Well, uh...

09:52.441 --> 09:53.943
Standing next to you,
getting very angry.

09:55.945 --> 09:57.947
Well, that would be you, Sam.

09:57.947 --> 09:59.448
Well, why do you

09:59.448 --> 10:00.950
put me through this stuff?

10:00.950 --> 10:02.752
Put you through what?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.675
Oh, hey, uh, Woody.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.177
Come here for a second, will ya?

10:11.177 --> 10:13.179
Uh, let me ask you a question.

10:13.179 --> 10:16.682
Who, uh, who's the
handsomest guy you know?

10:16.682 --> 10:19.185
Oh, that's easy--
Carla's butcher.

10:24.724 --> 10:25.725
Evening, everybody.

10:25.725 --> 10:26.726
ALL: Norm!

10:26.726 --> 10:28.728
What's the latest, Mr. Peterson?

10:28.728 --> 10:30.229
Zsa Zsa marries a millionaire.

10:30.229 --> 10:31.731
Peterson drinks a beer.

10:31.731 --> 10:32.732
Film at 11:00.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.233
Hey, uh, Normie, you're supposed to be

10:34.233 --> 10:35.735
at your interview down at the lodge.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.737
Oh, yeah, I've already been, Cliff.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.739
Already... That took what, 15 minutes?

10:39.739 --> 10:41.240
Yeah, something like that.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.241
CLIFF: Oh, uh, so,

10:42.241 --> 10:44.243
did you get to meet
the, uh, High Sultan?

10:44.243 --> 10:46.245
Good guy he was. Yeah.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.247
Oh, well, so tell me,
what'd you say to him?

10:48.247 --> 10:50.750
Uh, something like, uh, "Hi, High."

10:50.750 --> 10:53.252
CLIFF: That's great, Norm.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.254
I told you to be friendly, not flippant.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.256
You know, frankly,
this just doesn't bode

10:57.256 --> 10:58.758
at all well for you.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.760
(telephone rings)

11:00.760 --> 11:02.261
Cheers.

11:02.261 --> 11:03.512
It's for you.

11:03.512 --> 11:04.847
Hmm. It's probably those guys.

11:04.847 --> 11:06.349
They said they were gonna call.

11:06.349 --> 11:08.351
Yeah, like they called Joan of Arc

11:08.351 --> 11:10.853
before they turned
her into French toast.

11:10.853 --> 11:11.854
Now look, look.

11:11.854 --> 11:14.857
Just treat this guy
with respect, all right?

11:14.857 --> 11:16.359
Hello.

11:16.359 --> 11:17.360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:17.860 --> 11:18.861
Hi, High.

11:18.861 --> 11:20.863
Yeah.

11:20.863 --> 11:22.365
Great.

11:22.865 --> 11:25.368
Oh, no, no, no. No apology necessary.

11:25.368 --> 11:26.369
That's okay. Sure.

11:26.369 --> 11:27.870
All right, bye.

11:27.870 --> 11:29.372
Here. You blew it.

11:29.872 --> 11:30.873
You got nobody to blame
but yourself, Norm.

11:30.873 --> 11:32.875
No, Cliffie, he just, uh, apologized

11:32.875 --> 11:34.377
for making me wait so long.

11:34.377 --> 11:35.378
I'm, uh, I'm a Knight.

11:35.378 --> 11:36.379
Oh! Great!

11:36.379 --> 11:37.880
Congratulations.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.800
How's that for the old Clavin clout, eh?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.685
Evening, Sam.

11:42.685 --> 11:44.437
Hey, Frasier.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.438
What's with your voice?

11:45.438 --> 11:48.808
Oh, I spent the afternoon
screaming at a patient.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.775
Oh.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.647
What, what kind of therapy is that?

11:54.647 --> 11:55.648
No, it's not therapy.

11:55.648 --> 11:56.982
He burned a hole in my carpet.

12:01.404 --> 12:02.905
Anyway...

12:02.905 --> 12:04.907
how you doing, Sam, old man?

12:04.907 --> 12:07.410
You know, Frasier, I, uh,

12:07.410 --> 12:09.912
I don't like that
phrase "old man" anymore.

12:09.912 --> 12:11.914
Uh, I-I prefer "buddy."

12:11.914 --> 12:13.916
Oh, well, how you doing, Sam, old buddy?

12:16.419 --> 12:19.305
Look, is, uh, something bothering you?

12:21.173 --> 12:23.559
Well, yeah.

12:23.559 --> 12:25.478
Diane's made up some guy who's supposed

12:25.478 --> 12:26.979
to be great-looking,
just to get me riled.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.981
Only I could care less
about the whole thing.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.483
Well, good for you, Sam.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.485
You know, the old Sam
would've rambled on and on

12:32.485 --> 12:34.487
about how jealous he isn't,
proving only that he really is.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.488
Right.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.906
I mean, I could give

12:36.906 --> 12:38.407
a rat's rear what Diane does

12:38.407 --> 12:41.777
or who she does it with.

12:41.777 --> 12:44.580
And I certainly am not jealous
about some college punk kid.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.081
And even if I were,

12:46.081 --> 12:47.500
which I'm not...

12:47.500 --> 12:49.001
Call me at the office.

12:52.955 --> 12:55.458
Hey, Sammy, you want to see a sap?

12:55.458 --> 12:57.460
Sure, why not?

12:59.962 --> 13:01.964
That's me, Carla. Uh-huh.

13:01.964 --> 13:03.966
But a great-looking sap, right?

13:03.966 --> 13:05.468
Not bad. Why?

13:05.468 --> 13:06.469
Not bad?

13:06.469 --> 13:07.970
He's a killer.

13:07.970 --> 13:09.472
And I can't believe,
with a mug like that,

13:09.472 --> 13:11.474
you're letting Diane do a number on you.

13:11.474 --> 13:12.475
What are you talking about?

13:12.975 --> 13:13.976
Oh, come on, she's just trying

13:13.976 --> 13:16.479
to make you jealous,
and you're sucking it up

13:16.479 --> 13:17.730
like a Hoover deluxe.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.401
No, I'm not. I mean, first of all,

13:22.401 --> 13:24.737
I don't believe this Lance guy exists.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.122
But if he does exist, I don't
believe he's crazy about her.

13:27.122 --> 13:29.458
And even if he exists
and he's crazy about her,

13:29.458 --> 13:31.327
he's got to have a face like a fish.

13:33.662 --> 13:35.164
Uh, excuse me.

13:35.164 --> 13:36.665
Is Diane Chambers here?

13:36.665 --> 13:39.585
Uh, she'll be right back, Mister...?

13:39.585 --> 13:40.970
Apollonaire.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.392
Check out what Diane thinks
is great-looking, will you?

13:46.392 --> 13:48.761
(laughs)

13:52.314 --> 13:53.432
Carla?

13:54.183 --> 13:56.185
(thud)

14:02.892 --> 14:04.260
Is she gonna be all right?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.761
Yeah, of course she's
gonna be all right.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.263
Are you all right? You okay?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.148
Yeah, yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.935
I just had this dream that
I saw the handsomest man.

14:14.320 --> 14:14.987
(gasps)

14:14.987 --> 14:16.772
(thud)

14:16.772 --> 14:19.658
Would you stop that, please?

14:19.658 --> 14:21.026
Oh, nice going, Sam.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.028
I was hoping he'd
give me mouth-to-mouth.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.198
You still can, you know.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.535
Diane's upstairs.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.953
She'll be right down.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.204
Can I get you something?

14:32.204 --> 14:33.923
Yeah. How about a beer?

14:33.923 --> 14:35.207
Oh, dear, now, I'm sorry,

14:35.207 --> 14:37.710
I'm gonna have to ask you for an I.D.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.094
(laughs)

14:39.094 --> 14:41.213
Yeah, sure.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.935
(chuckling)

14:48.220 --> 14:50.222
Is something funny?

14:50.222 --> 14:53.225
Yeah, yeah, it says here
you're six two and a half.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.226
So?

14:54.226 --> 14:56.729
Ha! I'm six three.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.735
Oh, Diane, your little
friend's here to see you.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.538
Lance, what are you doing here?

15:06.538 --> 15:07.957
Well, I brought these for you.

15:07.957 --> 15:11.410
Six two and a half. (chuckles)

15:11.410 --> 15:13.412
Oh, thank you. They're beautiful.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.414
They must have cost you a fortune.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.416
Oh, no, I... I picked them all myself.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.418
And arranged them, too.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.922
I was hoping they might change your
mind about going with me to Vermont.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.924
Lance,

15:24.924 --> 15:27.927
I've already told you,
I don't think it would be

15:27.927 --> 15:30.930
a good idea for you and
me to go away together.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.432
Will you at least think about it?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.687
Okay...

15:38.687 --> 15:39.989
I'll...

15:39.989 --> 15:41.490
I'll think about it.

15:41.490 --> 15:42.491
Fair enough.

15:42.491 --> 15:44.493
Talk to you on Friday. Uh-huh.

15:48.497 --> 15:50.499
Oh, dear.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.421
Things are beginning to get complicated.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.423
Lance is becoming more insistent

15:57.423 --> 15:59.875
that I go away with him this weekend.

15:59.875 --> 16:03.379
So, Sam, should I go or not with this...

16:03.379 --> 16:06.382
figment of my imagination?

16:06.382 --> 16:08.884
Well, if you do, just make
sure he doesn't eat first.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.885
Children tend to get car sick.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.893
I know I shouldn't even
be considering it, but...

16:17.893 --> 16:21.397
when I look at him, I consider it.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.900
Excuse me, but what
happened to the woman

16:24.900 --> 16:28.404
who said it's the inner man who counts?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.406
That woman just pictured Lance

16:30.406 --> 16:33.409
gathering flowers in his bikini briefs.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.247
So did this one.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.889
MAN: Thank you, Brother Tanner,

16:46.889 --> 16:51.393
for reading the minutes
of last week's meeting.

16:51.393 --> 16:54.897
Now, Brother Foley, what is
the next order of business?

16:54.897 --> 16:56.899
According to the agenda, High Sultan,

16:56.899 --> 16:58.400
we're to welcome

16:58.400 --> 17:01.403
our newest member into the
Knights of the Scimitar.

17:01.403 --> 17:02.905
Ah, yes.

17:02.905 --> 17:05.773
Stand up, Norm Peterson,
and be welcomed.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.280
Norm, uh, Norm,

17:11.280 --> 17:13.749
why don't you tell us a
little bit about yourself, huh?

17:13.749 --> 17:15.751
Well, there's really
nothing to say, guys.

17:15.751 --> 17:16.752
Now...

17:16.752 --> 17:17.752
don't be modest.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.255
No, I mean it. There's
really nothing to say.

17:20.255 --> 17:21.707
Uh...

17:21.707 --> 17:24.209
Let's see, I was born in Chicago, uh...

17:24.209 --> 17:26.712
I moved to Boston and
became an accountant.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.713
Are you married?

17:27.713 --> 17:28.714
Yeah.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.131
To?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.132
Long.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.136
By the way, uh, in case you guys need

17:34.136 --> 17:36.138
a good accountant, you
know, I did happen to bring

17:36.638 --> 17:38.140
some of my business
cards along, so, uh...

17:38.140 --> 17:39.141
Oh, sorry,

17:39.141 --> 17:40.642
Norm, I-I guess you
didn't get the word.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.644
It-it's against the
rules to do business

17:43.145 --> 17:44.146
with fellow lodge members.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.320
You know, Cliff said...

17:51.820 --> 17:53.322
My fault for listening.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.824
HIGH SULTAN: Well, Norm,

17:55.824 --> 17:58.327
the time has now arrived...

17:58.327 --> 18:01.830
for you to undergo
the initiation ritual.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.332
Stand, please.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.252
Approach me.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.262
Are you prepared?

18:20.065 --> 18:21.567
Yeah.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.068
(gong sounds)

18:23.068 --> 18:24.570
Congratulations.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.578
Just, uh, just like that, huh?

18:32.578 --> 18:33.579
Yeah, that's it.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.080
Uh, grab a hat and sword
out of the bin, hmm?

18:35.080 --> 18:38.584
Great. Yeah, my God, the pageantry, huh?

18:38.584 --> 18:41.086
Okay, our, uh, next order of business

18:41.086 --> 18:42.087
is our third annual...

18:42.087 --> 18:43.589
Hey, uh, Normie, look, I'm sorry

18:43.589 --> 18:44.590
about that business rule.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.091
I, uh, I didn't know, I guess.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.593
Great time to find out, Cliff.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.094
Oh, hey, if it's any consolation,

18:49.094 --> 18:51.597
these guys give great parties.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.098
Hoo-hoo-hoo,
hey.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.600
Oh, I'll tell you, I thought this was

18:54.600 --> 18:56.101
going to be really stupid,

18:56.101 --> 18:57.603
but these are a good bunch of guys,

18:57.603 --> 18:58.604
I tell you. Yep.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.105
Well, have I ever
steered you wrong, Norm?

19:00.105 --> 19:02.608
Oh, yeah; that's why I thought
it was going to be stupid.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.110
But, uh, you know, it's too
bad about the business stuff,

19:05.110 --> 19:07.112
but I-I feel pretty
comfortable with these guys.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.615
Yeah. Really, thank you
for sponsoring me, buddy.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.617
Mm-hmm. I can't wait for
some of these parties.

19:11.617 --> 19:14.119
Bang, zoom, eh?

19:14.119 --> 19:15.621
HIGH SULTAN: Oh, uh, before I forget,

19:15.621 --> 19:17.623
the, uh, referendum that we ban beer

19:17.623 --> 19:19.875
at all lodge functions has been passed.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.660
Good-bye!

19:35.757 --> 19:38.260
So, what time's Peewee coming in?

19:40.262 --> 19:42.264
If you're referring to Lance,

19:42.264 --> 19:45.267
I'm expecting him shortl... soon.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.271
And I don't appreciate

19:49.271 --> 19:51.773
these constant attempts
to denigrate him.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.776
Let me ask you a question.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.278
What do you see in him?

19:56.278 --> 19:58.697
(laughs)

19:58.697 --> 20:04.703
You mean... besides a young,
brainy, stunningly gorgeous man

20:04.703 --> 20:06.705
with many interests similar to mine

20:06.705 --> 20:08.707
who's fawning over me and
giving me all the attention

20:08.707 --> 20:10.709
I could ever ask for?

20:10.709 --> 20:13.212
Yeah.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.517
I see what I used to see in you

20:18.517 --> 20:21.019
before you decided to
spend the last few months

20:21.019 --> 20:22.938
flogging me with your apathy.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.940
Well, I'm sorry, Diane,

20:24.940 --> 20:26.942
but that's all I had handy.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.396
Hi, Diane.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.399
Have you made a decision?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.903
Have I, Sam?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.905
Send me a postcard.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.830
I don't think I can go,

20:48.830 --> 20:51.667
because it would upset someone too much.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.387
Diane, go with someone's blessings.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.257
Excuse me.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.758
May I speak with you for a moment?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.760
Hop up on a stool there, Lance.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.262
Carla, why don't you pour him a beer?

21:08.767 --> 21:11.770
I know you're still smarting

21:11.770 --> 21:14.773
from my turning down
your proposal of marriage,

21:14.773 --> 21:17.276
but how long can you drag this out?

21:17.276 --> 21:19.278
You're hurting me, but
you're also hurting yourself

21:19.278 --> 21:21.780
with this feigned indifference.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.782
Well, while we're talking
about hurting people,

21:23.782 --> 21:25.284
how do you think Lance is going to feel

21:25.284 --> 21:27.286
when he finds out that
you're using him to get to me?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.788
I am not using him.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.790
I like him.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.292
He treats me wonderfully.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.296
And I don't, so go with him.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.766
(scoffs)

21:40.766 --> 21:43.685
Mr. Malone, I'm about
to call your bluff.

21:43.685 --> 21:45.637
I'm going to go with him,

21:45.637 --> 21:47.522
and I'm going to have a great time,

21:47.522 --> 21:51.943
and it will leave you
a hollow, broken man.

21:54.863 --> 21:56.865
All right.

21:57.866 --> 21:59.368
All right.

21:59.368 --> 22:00.369
Just watch while I give you

22:00.869 --> 22:04.373
a little preview of
our weekend together.

22:05.874 --> 22:07.876
I'm going to kiss him

22:07.876 --> 22:09.878
in front of you and the whole bar,

22:09.878 --> 22:11.380
and it's going to kill you.

22:12.881 --> 22:14.383
Lance...

22:14.383 --> 22:16.885
this is for the flowers.

22:25.894 --> 22:27.396
Now, Mr. Indifference, are you going

22:27.396 --> 22:28.897
to tell me that doesn't bother you?

22:28.897 --> 22:30.399
Well, I have to admit for a while there,

22:30.399 --> 22:32.401
my life passed before my eyes...

22:34.403 --> 22:36.405
...but the funny thing
is you weren't in it.

22:36.405 --> 22:37.906
Right.

22:37.906 --> 22:39.908
Lance, let's go.

22:39.908 --> 22:41.410
Diane?

22:41.410 --> 22:42.911
Yes, Sam?

22:42.911 --> 22:44.913
It would've bothered me

22:44.913 --> 22:46.415
if he had done this.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.935
Yes, I can see where
that might have given you

23:06.935 --> 23:08.937
cause for concern.

23:12.441 --> 23:13.442
(clears throat)

23:13.442 --> 23:15.360
Uh, so, Diane, are
you about ready to go?

23:17.946 --> 23:19.448
Uh...

23:19.448 --> 23:20.949
Lance. Thank you.

23:21.950 --> 23:24.453
Um... Lance,

23:24.453 --> 23:26.455
I-I-I just
remembered

23:26.455 --> 23:28.957
I have to work this weekend.

23:28.957 --> 23:31.460
That's okay. I understand.

23:32.961 --> 23:34.963
Bye. DIANE: Good-bye, Lance.

23:37.466 --> 23:39.968
Well, kid, you blew it.

23:39.968 --> 23:42.971
You know what would've
really have bothered Sam

23:42.971 --> 23:45.474
would be if you had
kissed her like this.

23:53.982 --> 23:55.484
Carla, you're not involved in this.

23:55.484 --> 23:56.985
I am now.
