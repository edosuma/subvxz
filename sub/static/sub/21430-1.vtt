00:54.220 --> 00:57.656
Hey! Darce.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.062
Look, you shouldn't be
out here either.

01:03.064 --> 01:06.198
Too many people come out
at the same time,

01:06.200 --> 01:07.366
she's gonna bust us.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.368
And then what?
- Mmm?

01:09.370 --> 01:10.803
No more gardening at night.

01:10.805 --> 01:13.405
Hey, you know how that
cramps your style.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.608
Well, I got these roses
on sale at Walmart today.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.211
I get 'em in the ground
while the soil's cooled off,

01:19.213 --> 01:20.279
else they're gonna wither.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.182
Serves you right if they wither,
shopping at Walmart.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.818
You want me to make coffee in
the morning or you gonna do it?

01:25.820 --> 01:29.855
Me. I'll see you at 7:00.
Get some sleep.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.490
It's too hot.

01:49.709 --> 01:52.744
Agh, it already feels like
i switched the blow dryer

01:52.746 --> 01:55.147
on "high" and held it up
to my face for half an hour.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.483
It doesn't help that
you're driving around

01:57.485 --> 01:58.417
in a mini sweat lodge.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.718
<i>Hello, folks.</i>

01:59.720 --> 02:01.887
<i>Today we're heading into
our 88th consecutive day</i>

02:01.889 --> 02:04.323
<i>of no rain here
in north Georgia in this,</i>

02:04.325 --> 02:06.525
<i>the hottest September
on record.</i>

02:06.527 --> 02:08.594
<i>And there's no rain in sight.</i>

02:10.131 --> 02:10.795
Oh, shit, space cowboy.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.298
Don't look, don't look,
don't look, don't look.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.167
What?
He knows your truck.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.803
Don't make eye contact.
Christ.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.606
He's never awake
this time of...

02:20.608 --> 02:22.875
hey, Clay, how you doing?

02:51.304 --> 02:54.706
Do you have a second, Darcy?

02:54.708 --> 02:55.774
I don't want to alarm you,

02:55.776 --> 02:57.809
because there is nothing
to worry about yet,

02:57.811 --> 03:01.647
but the Dean's been discussing
budget cuts and layoffs again,

03:01.649 --> 03:04.683
and we may have to pare down
on administrative assistants.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.817
Uh-huh.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.187
I know you were interested
in a tuition option

03:08.189 --> 03:10.422
after two years of service.
- Right.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.358
Did you get
your application in?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.227
Good, ma in American lit.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.829
Ba. Ba.
I never got my degree.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.532
Well, good for you
for finishing it now.

03:20.534 --> 03:24.836
Oh, also, you may have to pay
in more to the health plan.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.673
You don't have
any dependents, correct?

03:29.642 --> 03:31.243
No.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.478
So they need you
to get out there

03:33.480 --> 03:35.314
and find the money
and be all charming,

03:35.316 --> 03:37.783
so you're totally safe,
and geri,

03:37.785 --> 03:40.452
you know everything there is
to know about computers.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.687
Plus not to be blunt,

03:41.689 --> 03:43.855
but you got race <i> and</i> gender
on your side.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.692
Funny how things work out sometimes.
- Shut up.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.660
I think it'll be fine, darce.
Don't stress.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.763
You could always ask Clayton
for your old job back.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.831
No. No, no, no.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.601
No, she was the world's
worst waitress.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.835
No.
- Oh.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.339
I'll see you after work,
sweetheart.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.007
Love you.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.976
oh, pardon me.
- Sorry.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.380
Oh. Oh.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.649
Are you...

04:43.651 --> 04:45.951
is that Kevin?
Kevin Jenkins?

04:45.953 --> 04:48.754
Miss baylor,
how you been keeping?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.524
Fine.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.792
I'm sorry, Kevin.

04:53.794 --> 04:57.362
I... I almost didn't
recognize you.

04:57.364 --> 05:01.033
You just...
Look so different.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.734
This here is my wife, Beth.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.971
Oh, excuse me.
I'm Darcy, Darcy baylor.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.073
Kevin was friends
with my son Walker.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.575
They had some run together,
those two.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.777
Yep.

05:11.779 --> 05:15.080
From kindergarten all the way
through to grad school.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.615
They were thick as thieves.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.885
Kevin told me all about it.
Such a loss.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.687
I can't
imagine how painful...

05:21.689 --> 05:22.821
this your first?

05:22.823 --> 05:25.557
We've got three boys
already.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.625
This is a boy, too.

05:26.627 --> 05:30.629
Aren't you a little young
to have that many kids, Kevin?

05:30.631 --> 05:33.799
I'm almost 32, Ms. baylor.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.738
We're up from Birmingham
visiting mama.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.841
I run an accounting firm
down there now, so.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.010
Well,
you remember me to her.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.845
Yes, ma'am, of course.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.083
here you go, zipper.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.829
Hey.
- Hey.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.099
Want to come over?
I'm fixing a salad.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.066
<i>I can't, working late.</i>

07:15.068 --> 07:16.935
Dean says the funding letter's
gotta go out,

07:16.937 --> 07:19.171
and I'm up to my eyeballs
trying to track down

07:19.173 --> 07:20.806
any alum that's got money.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.208
Mm, donations
are in short supply, huh?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.643
<i>Mostly, but I just found</i>

07:24.645 --> 07:26.478
one prospect who's loaded,
apparently.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.581
Wasn't Walker friends
with some guy named mark Wright?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.082
Mark Wright.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.886
Oh, he's from
New Orleans originally?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.855
The very one.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.589
Yeah.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.758
He and Walker were in
business school together.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.062
I never liked that kid.
He had weird-ass energy.

07:44.064 --> 07:48.700
Huh, so, what can you tell me
about mark Wright?

07:48.702 --> 07:50.535
<i>I don't know.</i>

07:50.537 --> 07:54.906
Walker kind of idolized him.
I could never figure out why.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.843
He was from some rich family.
Yeah.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.912
He was dealing coke all over.
Not like he had to.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.216
But nobody ever bothered him
about it

08:04.218 --> 08:07.118
'cause he was a legacy.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.222
Did you see that?
Heat lightning.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.490
<i>It's a big fat tease.</i>

08:11.492 --> 08:17.028
Not like we're getting any
actual precipitation out of it.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.165
Anyway, mark was always
hiring Walker

08:20.167 --> 08:24.536
to do shit jobs like pick up
his dry cleaning

08:24.538 --> 08:26.137
because he knew
he was hard up for cash.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.640
Well, you know what they say.
Money begets money.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.877
<i>Mark Wright's worth something
like 5 million bucks now.</i>

08:31.879 --> 08:33.278
What?
-<i> Made it all in this chain</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:35.013
of restaurants down
in Louisiana.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.649
You shaving your legs or something?
- No.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.918
<i>What kind of restaurant?</i>
- Oh, it's ridiculous.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.852
It's like make
your own hot dogs,

08:41.855 --> 08:45.190
dogs the way you want them,
something like that.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.691
Hot dogs.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.259
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:47.261 --> 08:50.228
Like ones made
with all-natural ingredients,

08:50.230 --> 08:53.064
<i>and some of them
are vegetarian?</i>

08:53.066 --> 08:54.566
Uh-huh.
-<i> Like tofu?</i>

08:54.568 --> 08:57.936
Uh-huh.
- Is it called the dawg house?

08:57.938 --> 09:00.005
Like d-a-w-g?

09:00.007 --> 09:03.775
Yeah, d-a-w-g.
How'd you know that?

09:06.045 --> 09:09.180
<i>Darce?
Are you still there?</i>

09:11.617 --> 09:13.018
I gotta go.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.224
Hey.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.866
Last time I saw that look
on your face,

10:01.868 --> 10:04.970
it was the night that you broke
that menu board

10:04.972 --> 10:08.039
over some guy's head
when he grabbed your ass

10:08.041 --> 10:10.742
when you set down
his meatloaf.

10:12.044 --> 10:14.613
I was in the stock room
minding my own business,

10:14.615 --> 10:17.916
and I heard "cr-ack."

10:17.918 --> 10:20.318
Cleaved it clean in two.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.394
Darcy?

10:29.396 --> 10:32.263
If you didn't want to see me,
what you come in here for?

10:32.265 --> 10:36.368
It's good to get out
of the house sometimes.

10:37.770 --> 10:41.973
Byrd told me you're worried
about your job.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.708
Town crier.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.747
Are you going to quit
being cryptic or what?

11:53.045 --> 11:57.749
Remember when you, me,
and Walker dug this bed?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.417
I do.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.954
He's been coming up
all day today.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.891
Some days, you know,
he just sort of surfaces.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.127
Some days not at all.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.032
When he was real little
and I barely had

12:14.034 --> 12:15.500
two pennies to rub together,

12:15.502 --> 12:19.104
there was one thing
we would always do on Saturdays,

12:19.106 --> 12:22.941
and that was walk up to Louie's
and get hot dogs.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.376
I'd get two everythings.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.344
He'd get a chili dog.

12:26.346 --> 12:31.049
We'd both get lemonades,
and then we'd walk home.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.151
It didn't matter what it was
like out weather-wise.

12:33.153 --> 12:38.356
Eating our hot dogs, you know,
talking about this and that.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.524
Even in the rain.

12:39.526 --> 12:44.028
We considered it good luck
to eat a hot dog in the rain.

12:45.331 --> 12:48.867
Once Walker got done
with his lemonade,

12:48.869 --> 12:53.037
he'd hold my hand
up till he was around 10 or so,

12:53.039 --> 12:54.372
and then he quit.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.474
Well,
the time's gonna come

12:56.476 --> 13:00.044
when a boy eventually lets go
of his mama's hand.

13:02.782 --> 13:09.020
When he was getting
his business plan together

13:09.022 --> 13:10.088
for grad school,

13:10.090 --> 13:13.424
he wanted to start a chain
of family restaurants

13:13.426 --> 13:15.059
where you can make
your own hot dog,

13:15.061 --> 13:18.163
and I thought to myself,
i took this child to museums

13:18.165 --> 13:20.231
and read him good books
and paid for cello lessons,

13:20.233 --> 13:22.300
and all he's hanging onto
is the hot dogs.

13:22.302 --> 13:26.971
Well, he had his own ideas
about what he wanted to do.

13:27.873 --> 13:31.009
He worked the whole thing out,
real detailed.

13:31.011 --> 13:35.814
I know, 'cause
i typed it up for him.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.116
And then his professor
handed it back

13:38.118 --> 13:40.485
and told him that business plan
was never gonna fly.

13:40.487 --> 13:45.089
Was that the professor
you stared at real hard

13:45.091 --> 13:48.293
when he parked his Honda
by the light downtown and then,

13:48.295 --> 13:52.463
poof, his engine died?

13:55.367 --> 13:59.537
Yeah.
He was only 24.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.909
If I could've gotten him
over that hump.

14:04.911 --> 14:10.281
If... if I could've
just helped him...

14:10.283 --> 14:11.216
Get a little further.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.952
If he even made it to 30,
he would've been okay.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.955
I know.
I know you believe that.

14:16.957 --> 14:23.595
But you just gotta quit blaming
yourself eventually, baby.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.026
Mm.

14:55.527 --> 14:56.494
Here.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.097
Oh,<i> that</i> asshole.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.431
Oh, yeah, that guy.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.400
You know, he used to come
into the bar

15:02.402 --> 15:05.403
and try and order expensive
bottles of champagne

15:05.405 --> 15:07.338
he knew damn well
we didn't carry.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.007
He drove by in his Audi
blasting rap music

15:09.009 --> 15:11.609
and hollering at Walker
when he was cutting your grass.

15:11.611 --> 15:16.581
I forgot all about that.
Watch those crumbs, Clay.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.348
Honey, I mean,

15:17.350 --> 15:21.052
even if he stole Walker's idea,
you can't prove it.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.289
If I can find a copy of Walker's
old business plan, I can.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.190
What are you gonna do?
You gonna sue him?

15:26.192 --> 15:27.525
You want his money?

15:27.527 --> 15:28.993
That's not what I want.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.396
Why not?
You could use it.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.931
Maybe.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.700
That's not what I'm after.

15:35.702 --> 15:39.170
When byrd called me,
it was like something...

15:39.172 --> 15:44.242
I don't know, I don't know
how to describe it.

15:44.244 --> 15:48.046
It was like something
filled up this room.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.481
It was pushing at the walls,

15:50.483 --> 15:54.218
like they were vibrating
or something.

15:54.220 --> 15:58.222
I felt Walker's presence
in here so strong.

15:58.224 --> 16:03.428
I hadn't felt that way
since the night he died.

16:03.430 --> 16:08.399
Every molecule of me
was alive to him.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.569
He was calling to me.

16:11.571 --> 16:16.741
What else can I do
except try to answer?

16:31.056 --> 16:33.024
Darcy baylor.
My, what a surprise.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.727
Hey, sue Anne, your yard's
sure looking gorgeous.

16:35.729 --> 16:39.530
Aren't you worried about getting
ticketed for the sprinklers?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.599
Oh, we aren't
on water restrictions

16:41.601 --> 16:43.001
here in the heights.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.369
What can I help you with,
Darcy?

16:44.371 --> 16:47.205
Well, actually,
I'm looking for Kevin.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.007
Well, he and Beth
and the boys

16:49.009 --> 16:50.742
headed back to Alabama
around dawn.

16:50.744 --> 16:54.479
I need to speak with him
about something.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.648
Maybe you could just give me
his number then.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.719
Um, try "zipper."

17:02.454 --> 17:04.288
That's not it either.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.522
What about "interpol"?

17:05.525 --> 17:06.391
Some kind of joke?

17:06.393 --> 17:10.328
It's the name
of his favorite band.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.429
Mm-mm.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.663
"Asimov."

17:12.665 --> 17:16.034
What? What?
- "Asimov."

17:16.036 --> 17:16.434
Uh-uh.

17:16.435 --> 17:20.704
There's got to be some kind
of code you can crack.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.574
It's encrypted,
i mean, you gotta figure out

17:23.576 --> 17:25.042
the password he
would've used, Darcy.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.212
Otherwise nothing I can do.
- "Periwinkle."

17:28.214 --> 17:29.047
"Periwinkle"?

17:29.049 --> 17:32.316
You sure you don't
have a single hard copy

17:32.318 --> 17:33.217
of that thing anywhere?

17:33.219 --> 17:36.687
Those aren't the kinds
of things i held onto.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.165
Cinnamon roll.
- Yeah.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.134
Look, I'll cut to the chase, Clay.
- Okay.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.637
I need that thing you been
holding for me.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.605
I'm sorry, what thing?

17:54.607 --> 17:57.375
That bag.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.844
From the police.

17:59.846 --> 18:03.081
Why do you need that
right now?

18:04.516 --> 18:07.085
I just feel like
maybe it's time.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.554
Time to use what's in
the bag?

18:09.556 --> 18:13.491
It's just I'm ready
to take it back now.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.594
Yeah?

18:18.564 --> 18:20.631
I don't think so.

18:20.633 --> 18:25.837
You do know that it's my job
to protect you from you.

18:25.839 --> 18:30.274
In fact, I could make it
my full-time vocation.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.643
Please.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.846
Just give it to me.

18:56.902 --> 18:58.636
Stop!
You stop right there!

18:58.638 --> 19:01.639
I'm calling the cops!
You're trespassing!

19:01.641 --> 19:02.773
Sorry, i-i-i...

19:02.775 --> 19:05.276
Who are you?!
What're you doing here?!

19:05.278 --> 19:06.277
My name's Darcy baylor.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.614
I just... I knew somebody
who used to live in this house.

19:09.616 --> 19:13.484
Whoa.
Walker's mom?

19:14.153 --> 19:19.457
So when mark moved out,
his dad let me stay on.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.758
Figure they got so much money,

19:20.760 --> 19:24.495
forgot they even owned
the place, you know?

19:24.497 --> 19:29.467
Some accountant pays
the taxes once a year.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.635
It's all good.

19:30.637 --> 19:34.372
You got some needle and thread,
i could mend that for you.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.509
You still talk to mark?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.812
No, nope, we're not in touch.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.452
Dennis?

19:48.454 --> 19:50.655
I need you to think back

19:50.657 --> 19:55.193
to around the time that...
that Walker died.

19:57.796 --> 20:01.399
About how he was acting,
how mark was acting,

20:01.401 --> 20:05.937
what might've been going on
between those two.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.474
Dennis.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.377
I don't know.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.614
There weren't any bad vibes
or anything.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.281
Uh-huh.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.217
I'd have picked up on it
if there was.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.685
Yeah, of course.
- You know?

20:20.687 --> 20:25.256
I mean, Walker was kind of
a mess that day, but...

20:25.258 --> 20:27.758
wait, what day?

20:27.760 --> 20:28.793
Well...

20:28.795 --> 20:31.295
You know, the day he, uh...

20:31.297 --> 20:33.764
Walker came out here
the day he died?

20:33.766 --> 20:34.732
Yeah.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.001
Well, how come none of you boys
ever told me that?

20:37.003 --> 20:39.904
You never asked.
Why are you asking now?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.772
It's been, what,
six years or something?

20:41.774 --> 20:44.575
Seven.
Just tell me.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.979
Okay.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.416
Well...

20:52.418 --> 20:53.884
I remember it was hot,

20:53.886 --> 20:56.654
hot and dry
like it's been lately.

20:56.656 --> 21:00.625
Walker dragged his ass
all the way in from town.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.361
Tried to hitch,
but nobody'd pick him up.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.930
That's why he had
the blisters.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.466
And when Walker got here,

21:08.468 --> 21:12.270
he and mark went back
into mark's room.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.305
They were doing lines.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.606
I guess.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.440
Come on, Dennis.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.944
Mark, he always had it,
you know?

21:20.846 --> 21:23.748
But the weird thing was,

21:23.750 --> 21:27.718
when Walker came out
of mark's room, he had...

21:29.054 --> 21:31.022
What?

21:32.791 --> 21:36.027
He had... he had a box
of bullets in his hand.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.789
<i>you know, back when I was
in business school,</i>

23:11.791 --> 23:14.792
<i>my professor told me
my plan wasn't going to cut it.</i>

23:14.794 --> 23:17.728
<i>A restaurant
that's all about hot dogs?</i>

23:17.730 --> 23:18.929
<i>Who would go eat there?</i>

23:18.931 --> 23:21.132
<i>But when I was a boy,
my mama and me would get</i>

23:21.134 --> 23:23.534
<i>a hot dog at the corner store
every Saturday</i>

23:23.536 --> 23:25.803
<i>just like clockwork,
even if it was raining.</i>

23:25.805 --> 23:29.140
<i>We considered that good luck,
eating a hot dog in the rain,</i>

23:29.142 --> 23:31.108
<i>and I knew if I just honored
that memory,</i>

23:31.110 --> 23:34.745
<i>well, sir, everything was gonna
be just fine.</i>

23:38.151 --> 23:40.885
Did you ever go all the way
through that site to where

23:40.887 --> 23:43.587
mark Wright's talking about
how he started that business?

23:43.589 --> 23:44.054
Mm-mm.

23:44.056 --> 23:48.092
He took every little bit
of Walker, every last bit,

23:48.094 --> 23:50.494
and he is on that thing
bragging about it,

23:50.496 --> 23:51.095
celebrating it.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.464
That's why I'm headed
to New Orleans in the morning.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.065
What? No, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.934
Well,
then I'm coming with you.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.905
Byrd.
I want you to come.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.108
Geri and I bought tickets for
that concert in Atlanta tomorrow.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.210
And you got that
big project due for Colin.

24:06.212 --> 24:09.580
Well, I'll stay up tonight
and finish it.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.615
Come here.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.518
I mean,
what are you gonna do, baby?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.120
You gonna wave that gun
in his face

24:16.122 --> 24:17.455
and tell him to apologize?

24:17.457 --> 24:20.591
Come on.
That's just pure foolishness.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.092
That's the last thing
you need to be doing.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.694
You don't know what
i need to be doing.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.029
Stop bossing me around.
Jesus Christ.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.198
That's why I broke up with you
in the first place.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.599
No. No, it's not.
No, it's not.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.168
No, it's not why you broke up
with me, and you know it.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.171
You couldn't commit to a man
who loves you.

24:34.173 --> 24:37.007
You... you couldn't commit
to a man who loves you

24:37.009 --> 24:38.742
and who asked you to marry him.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.544
And you been avoiding me
as of late.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.079
And why is that, Darcy?
You know why?

24:42.081 --> 24:45.916
Because, because you're stuck.
You're stuck,

24:45.918 --> 24:50.221
and you're so goddamn stubborn,
you can't even see it.

25:03.768 --> 25:05.503
look,
i get why you're so upset,

25:05.505 --> 25:07.805
and why you think you gotta go
settle this thing

25:07.807 --> 25:09.707
right this second,
but think it through.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.977
Ask for the days off.
Don't just take them.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.211
Don't risk your job.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.613
That's what pays the bills,
right?

25:15.615 --> 25:18.215
That's what's gonna get you
your degree.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.718
I didn't put in
my application.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.820
What?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.822
It was due last week.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.291
I know that.
I know.

25:27.293 --> 25:31.662
But I didn't put it in.
Okay?

25:36.001 --> 25:38.869
And I'm not gonna wait, byrd.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.841
I can't.

25:51.983 --> 25:54.118
Oh, darce.

26:43.134 --> 26:46.270
<i> Temperatures
are gonna hit 98 by midday,</i>

26:46.272 --> 26:48.806
<i>but with that nasty old
heat index,</i>

26:48.808 --> 26:50.674
<i>it's gonna feel more like 105.</i>

26:50.676 --> 26:53.611
Jesus Christ, we're not
crossing the Atlantic.

26:53.613 --> 26:54.278
I like to have options.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.013
Let her bring whatever
she damn well feels like.

26:56.015 --> 26:59.149
<i>We're going to be talking
to local farmer Roy johnston.</i>

26:59.151 --> 27:03.621
<i>Roy spent $82.000
so far this year...</i>

27:03.623 --> 27:05.990
Oh, my goodness, stop.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.291
Bye.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.093
I'm gonna miss you.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.962
<i>Now that it's getting
on harvest time.</i>

27:11.964 --> 27:13.263
<i>No matter how much water</i>

27:13.265 --> 27:14.832
<i>they're throwing
at the problem,</i>

27:14.834 --> 27:16.800
<i>farmers everywhere
are seeing their crops</i>

27:16.802 --> 27:20.404
<i>just rot and wither
on the vine.</i>

27:54.039 --> 27:57.374
I want you to see if what i
figured out makes sense to you.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.076
We can just use Google maps on
my phone, Darcy.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.179
You don't need some method of
navigation from the mesozoic era.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.916
I like to see the roads
laid out in front of me

28:05.918 --> 28:07.351
on one piece of paper.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.086
Why are we going so far
west of the Mississippi?

28:09.088 --> 28:11.021
Look, it'd be faster if we
just stayed on the interstate

28:11.023 --> 28:14.358
all the way down through Alabama
into Mississippi and Louisiana.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.328
I hate those goddamn trucks.
You know?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.863
I want to do back roads.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.699
And I got a friend
who lives in meridian.

28:21.701 --> 28:25.002
We can spend the night
with her and save on a motel.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.170
Who do you know in meridian?

28:26.172 --> 28:29.907
Mary Lou Healy,
married name Mary Lou Powell.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.476
Got divorced,
took back her Healy.

28:34.012 --> 28:35.813
I grew up in meridian.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.449
I didn't know
about meridian.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.453
You know what wordsmith's
word of the day is?

28:42.455 --> 28:44.722
Delphian, kinda rhymes
with meridian, right?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.457
It's doesn't kinda rhyme.
Rhymes.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.325
Kind of.
There's a syllabic problem.

28:48.327 --> 28:48.959
Uh-huh.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.862
It means ambiguous,
cryptic, incomprehensible,

28:51.864 --> 28:53.731
indecipherable,
inexplicable.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.200
It always also means
goddamn annoying.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.847
look, if we're gonna be stuck in
this truck for a couple of days

29:43.849 --> 29:45.549
staring at a piece of paper
and lacking any kind

29:45.551 --> 29:48.485
of proper cooling system,
we're gonna have to talk,

29:48.487 --> 29:50.854
and I don't just mean
about our jobs

29:50.856 --> 29:53.957
or whether you should
or should not get a new car,

29:53.959 --> 29:54.925
which in fact you should,

29:54.927 --> 29:57.561
or whether I'm an actual lesbian
or just a dabbler.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.862
Dabbler.
- What the hell?

29:58.864 --> 30:02.866
I'm teasing, but you know,
you slept with men.

30:02.868 --> 30:03.867
Yes, at one time.

30:03.869 --> 30:07.404
I could care less
who you do it with, byrd.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.572
It's not about
who I do it with.

30:08.574 --> 30:12.075
Don't make light of what I have with geri,
'cause I sure as hell don't.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.578
Is that how you think about Clayton?
- Oh.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.079
My point is
y'all lived together once.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.848
I thought you liked
having him in your house.

30:17.850 --> 30:21.385
No, no, I did not.
It... it made me crazy.

30:21.387 --> 30:24.154
He never put anything
back in the right place.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.023
But you liked
waking up with him.

30:26.025 --> 30:30.561
Hmm.
I'm not catching your drift.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.345
Hey, you got
any extra sunglasses?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.848
Oh, look in my bag.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.526
Put that back.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.629
Tell me this is what
Clayton keeps behind the bar.

31:05.631 --> 31:06.563
It is not.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.566
Tell me that this
isn't the same gun.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.468
It is.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.547
Now you listen to me,
Darcy baylor.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.483
I'm the only one who got behind
this crazy journey of yours

31:26.485 --> 31:28.518
because I do understand
why you gotta see it through.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.153
If somebody's wronged you
or somebody you love,

31:30.155 --> 31:33.223
you're gonna get up in that
person's face till they yield

31:33.225 --> 31:34.157
to your indomitable will.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.927
That's not the way I tend to do
things or even the way I'd want

31:36.929 --> 31:40.597
to do things if I could,
but I do respect you for it.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.166
All right,
so I'm here for moral support.

31:43.168 --> 31:45.235
I haven't any idea what's
gonna lie at the end of this,

31:45.237 --> 31:48.171
but I'm not accompanying you
on some mission of violence.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.140
Who said anything
about a mission of violence?

31:50.142 --> 31:53.610
Jesus Christ, byrd,
you're so melodramatic sometimes.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.979
Why do you need to bring a gun
if you don't plan on using it?

31:55.981 --> 31:58.248
I didn't say I <i> don't</i> plan
on using it.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.117
I'm asking you
about your intentions.

32:00.119 --> 32:04.221
My intention is to make
Birmingham by lunchtime.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.066
<i>I'm sorry, Mrs. Baylor,</i>

32:49.068 --> 32:51.001
I did fully intend
to get back to you.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.636
There was no need
for you to come

32:52.638 --> 32:54.271
all the way down here
to my place of business.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.174
Just wanted to talk
face to face, that's all, Kevin.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.276
I don't know why you've went

32:59.278 --> 33:03.146
and drug Ms. ritt
along with you.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.481
Right.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.684
So, uh...
Can you tell me what is it

33:07.686 --> 33:09.419
you think I can help you with
regarding Walker?

33:09.421 --> 33:14.291
So this was taken just a little
bit before Walker died, right?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.058
I think so, yeah.

33:15.060 --> 33:19.162
Okay, so obviously,
you and Walker, mark Wright,

33:19.164 --> 33:20.998
Dennis, and...
and who's that?

33:21.000 --> 33:24.201
Ah, that's buford.
Buford lapierre.

33:24.203 --> 33:24.735
Who?

33:24.737 --> 33:26.603
He got a full ride
to the act school

33:26.605 --> 33:28.138
on account of being a cajun.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.373
He was renting out
the back room.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.441
We didn't know him so well.

33:31.443 --> 33:36.346
See, Dennis told me that Walker
came out there the day he died.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.615
Were you around, too?

33:38.617 --> 33:40.617
Yes, ma'am, I was.

33:40.619 --> 33:44.287
And Dennis told me that Walker
left that house

33:44.289 --> 33:46.289
with a box of bullets.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.125
Remember that?
- No.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.060
Dennis says mark
gave them to him.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.062
Now why in the world
would mark do that?

33:52.064 --> 33:53.697
So he could take
Walker's business plan

33:53.699 --> 33:55.732
and run away with it maybe?
- Far as I know,

33:55.734 --> 33:57.734
mark's made his money
fair and square.

33:57.736 --> 34:01.738
I mean, look, even if Walker
came up with an idea,

34:01.740 --> 34:04.408
doesn't mean he could've
implemented it, right?

34:04.410 --> 34:05.609
It's not like
he copyrighted it.

34:05.611 --> 34:08.578
Are you even serious?
- All I'm saying is it takes

34:08.580 --> 34:11.281
a certain drive,
a certain vision to take an idea

34:11.283 --> 34:13.650
and make it succeed,
and while mark...

34:13.652 --> 34:15.752
oh, I'd stop right there
if I were you.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.754
Kevin Jenkins,
i can't believe

34:17.755 --> 34:19.489
you came to my house
for sleepovers

34:19.491 --> 34:23.092
more times than I can count
all through high school,

34:23.094 --> 34:24.795
and me cooking
pancake breakfasts.

34:24.797 --> 34:27.063
You could play guitars
real loud.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.598
After you let Walker
quit violin.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.599
It was cello.

34:29.601 --> 34:33.270
Point is, it was more of
a free atmosphere for you boys.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.271
You could have a little fun,

34:34.273 --> 34:36.473
unlike at your mama's house
up in the heights.

34:36.475 --> 34:37.808
At least my mama
wasn't having parties

34:37.810 --> 34:40.744
and dancing around in the garden
and refusing to put in a shower.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.480
Walker had to take a bath
in a damn tub all the time.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.183
Clawfoot.
Stall showers are ugly.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.451
He wanted things
to be normal.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.351
Normal's overrated.
- He wanted a normal mom.

34:49.353 --> 34:53.690
We're not here to talk about
your idea of normal, Kevin.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.827
Imagine if this happened
to one of your boys.

34:56.829 --> 34:58.662
My boys are being raised
in a stable,

34:58.664 --> 35:00.163
loving, two-parent home.

35:00.165 --> 35:02.866
Yeah, that always
works out great.

35:02.868 --> 35:06.269
Try to imagine
if something did happen.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.746
Look...

35:16.748 --> 35:21.852
Buford lapierre was in the room
with Walker and mark.

35:22.587 --> 35:25.589
As far as I know, he moved
back home after graduation.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.591
Maybe you could find him.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.862
Not beaufort like the city.
Buford, b-u-f-o-r-d.

35:31.864 --> 35:35.799
Yeah, lapierre's the last name,
spelled like it sounds.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.135
It should be in the alumni
records for that year.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.904
Thanks, baby.
She's looking it up.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.709
Yep.

35:45.711 --> 35:46.376
Nope.

35:46.378 --> 35:50.747
Uh, near Simone city
on the atchafalaya river.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.415
Simone city.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.785
Uh-huh, geri says she got
a present for you, darce.

35:55.787 --> 35:58.755
Aw, is it Clayton's balls
on a platter?

35:58.757 --> 35:59.756
Quit ragging on him.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.825
You'll be lucky
if he ever speaks to you again.

36:01.827 --> 36:06.329
She just needs a snail mail
address so she can overnight it.

36:14.305 --> 36:18.909
last time I was
in meridian was...

36:18.911 --> 36:21.578
When my parents died.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.746
Walker was six.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.948
They died a month apart,
two funerals, boom boom.

36:24.950 --> 36:28.318
Sold the house and contents,
kept the kitchen table.

36:28.320 --> 36:28.885
That was that.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.654
So it was like one
of those stories

36:30.656 --> 36:32.756
where a married couple
loves each other so much,

36:32.758 --> 36:35.825
they couldn't bear
to be separated in death?

36:35.827 --> 36:36.560
Nope.

36:49.208 --> 36:53.710
Stop it. Stop it.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.680
Oh, my lord.
Don't go there.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.649
Don't even go there.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.384
Oh.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.420
You want another glass
of wine?

37:03.422 --> 37:04.721
No, I'm all right.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.289
Oh, byrd's a beer drinker.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.491
Well, I haven't had beer
in my fridge

37:08.493 --> 37:12.362
since I got ray freaking Powell
out of my life.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.566
Mr. social tourette's.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.737
He could not keep
from saying inappropriate things

37:20.739 --> 37:24.507
at group gatherings
in this really loud voice,

37:24.509 --> 37:28.345
like he had no idea people were
standing inches away from him.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.580
"Hey, so what's
the story with Chuck?

37:30.582 --> 37:33.383
Is he really checking
into rehab?"

37:34.586 --> 37:37.954
And so on and so forth,
oh, my.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.623
What an asshole.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.561
I hate that smell
on my furniture.

37:44.563 --> 37:47.931
Only out on the balcony,
and if you do go out,

37:47.933 --> 37:48.999
close the slider.

37:49.001 --> 37:53.036
I like my condo
as cold as a popsicle.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.308
It hurts me that you smoke,
honey.

37:58.310 --> 38:01.011
It hurts me <i> not</i> to smoke.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.518
Hey, Wes is back in town,
you know.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.919
No, I did not know.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.355
Well, I thought Tommy
would've told you.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.423
I don't speak to Tommy.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.624
Well,
i thought you and Tommy

38:14.626 --> 38:15.859
would've patched things up
by now.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.794
I don't speak to a single person
from that family.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.864
Not one of those sanfords
came to Walker's service.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.966
Well,
maybe they were looking

38:22.968 --> 38:25.502
to gather in a cemetery
with a headstone.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.470
Maybe they didn't want
to hear you reading

38:27.472 --> 38:31.374
some complicated poem
out loud at a memorial.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.409
It was keats.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.544
Well, whatever,
it was poetry.

38:34.546 --> 38:37.547
Where's Wes at? Jesus.
I don't want to run into him.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.983
I might have to kill him.
- She's got a gun in her truck.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.086
It's a figure a speech.
- Oh, Darcy, really?

38:43.088 --> 38:46.456
Look... Macy brought Wes
back to meridian

38:46.458 --> 38:51.528
a couple months ago,
and he's not doing so hot.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.363
He's over
at the oak hill home.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.900
What?!
That's for old people.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.868
Well, he's 14 years older
than you, right?

38:58.870 --> 39:02.539
Do the math.
- Math's not her strong suit.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.573
Oh, I know that, sugar.

39:03.575 --> 39:06.409
We went to elementary school
together.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.478
Wes is pushing 70.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.715
Goddamn it.
- I thought you should know.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.451
I mean,
maybe you wish he was dead,

39:14.453 --> 39:17.020
but you still share a history.

39:17.022 --> 39:21.624
So, you girls are heading on
to New Orleans tomorrow?

39:21.626 --> 39:22.926
After breakfast, yeah.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.861
Mm.
And then what, Darcy?

39:24.863 --> 39:27.797
You're just going to walk
into this guy's office

39:27.799 --> 39:30.834
and tell him that you know
he took Walker's concept?

39:30.836 --> 39:33.370
And what do you suppose
he's going to say to that?

39:33.372 --> 39:35.038
I just need to be in
the same room with him,

39:35.040 --> 39:37.974
look him in the eye,
then I'll figure it out.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.642
I've never been much
of a planner.

39:39.644 --> 39:41.444
I understand you want
to make things right

39:41.446 --> 39:43.380
for Walker,
for Walker's sake.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.815
You don't think my blood boils
every time I think

39:45.817 --> 39:48.852
of someone causing
that precious child any pain?

39:48.854 --> 39:52.889
Remember when he was two and
we took him to see the ducks?

39:52.891 --> 39:57.460
Quack, quack.

40:01.432 --> 40:03.733
Wes was a nasty drunk.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.403
He was beating on her
all the time.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.871
Half the time,
she walked around

40:07.873 --> 40:10.673
looking like
a goddamn raccoon.

40:10.675 --> 40:14.577
So one night,
Darcy just picked up Walker

40:14.579 --> 40:16.880
and some clothes
and took off.

40:16.882 --> 40:17.781
Never looked back.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.449
Changed her name
back to baylor,

40:19.451 --> 40:21.084
got Walker's name
changed to baylor,

40:21.086 --> 40:25.054
and then just cut the sanford
right out her life.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.056
It's not like
i had a choice.

40:27.058 --> 40:30.727
Mama and daddy told me
point blank

40:30.729 --> 40:31.694
I couldn't come home,

40:31.696 --> 40:33.029
that I had a husband
and that was that.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.632
Well, they took up for Wes,
it's true.

40:35.634 --> 40:38.168
They just didn't know
any better.

40:38.170 --> 40:38.768
Really?

40:38.770 --> 40:41.104
Didn't know better
than to refuse

40:41.106 --> 40:43.173
to give their daughter
and grandbaby a damn penny?

40:43.175 --> 40:44.974
You know Wes never paid
any child support.

40:44.976 --> 40:48.178
Only time he'd call
was when he was all lit up,

40:48.180 --> 40:51.581
crying about missing his boy
and then crying

40:51.583 --> 40:52.615
'cause that boy was dead.

40:52.617 --> 40:55.685
Well, he felt bad about it.
- Says you.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.487
No, Wes is not always
a monster.

40:57.489 --> 41:01.191
Is. - So Wes is always a monster,
your parents were monsters.

41:01.193 --> 41:03.960
Everybody who ever did you
any wrong is a monster.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.963
That's right.
- Oh, poor, poor pitiful Darcy.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.898
Shut up, ml.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.910
Hey.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.547
You okay?

41:24.549 --> 41:25.949
Yeah.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.795
Darcy?

42:14.131 --> 42:15.865
Darce?

42:30.281 --> 42:32.048
Oh, my god.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.819
Wes.

42:40.791 --> 42:43.026
Wes.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.328
It's me, Darcy.

42:48.799 --> 42:51.935
Okay with you
if I sit down?

43:05.849 --> 43:07.617
Wes.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.220
I don't know if you can
understand

43:11.222 --> 43:13.690
a word I'm about to say,

43:13.692 --> 43:17.594
but I came here
to talk to you about our boy.

43:34.078 --> 43:36.646
You recognize this?

43:38.382 --> 43:41.684
You said it was part
of his legacy.

43:41.686 --> 43:44.988
It's part of his legacy,
all right.

43:44.990 --> 43:46.923
Remember?

43:48.726 --> 43:53.630
You gave it to him
on the day he was born.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.402
That was your...

43:59.404 --> 44:01.938
Idea of a...

44:01.940 --> 44:04.874
Baby present,
i guess.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.146
I was thinking about it

44:10.148 --> 44:13.683
Standing out
on Mary Lou's balcony

44:13.685 --> 44:14.784
last night.

44:14.786 --> 44:18.021
I can't even explain to you
what it was like

44:18.023 --> 44:21.024
watching that baby shoot
right out from between my legs

44:21.026 --> 44:25.962
when he'd been inside me
for so long.

44:25.964 --> 44:28.431
And then he was there.

44:28.866 --> 44:33.069
And when they put him in
my arms wrapped up so tight,

44:33.071 --> 44:36.673
and...
and I thought, oh...

44:36.675 --> 44:38.174
Look at you.

44:39.877 --> 44:42.445
You're a dreamer.

44:43.881 --> 44:46.916
You're my baby boy.

44:49.086 --> 44:54.123
I hope the world doesn't knock
that sweetness out of you.

44:58.796 --> 45:00.697
When I walked into
the house that night

45:00.699 --> 45:03.266
and saw his sneakers
sitting by the back door,

45:03.268 --> 45:05.368
I called out his name.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.736
I figured...

45:06.738 --> 45:10.473
It was too hot
in that apartment of his,

45:10.475 --> 45:13.876
and he'd come home
to cool off.

45:15.813 --> 45:19.382
He'd been so anxious.

45:19.384 --> 45:21.451
So goddamn anxious
all the time.

45:21.453 --> 45:24.353
I walked back
to check on him

45:24.355 --> 45:27.457
and walked into his room.

45:28.726 --> 45:32.028
Oh, oh, oh...

45:54.419 --> 45:56.853
You hear those birds?

45:57.788 --> 45:59.489
Do you?

46:01.291 --> 46:03.092
Do you?

46:04.828 --> 46:07.029
Do you?
Do you hear them?

46:38.428 --> 46:40.530
Good-bye, Wes.

47:11.895 --> 47:13.229
hey.
- Hey, you're back.

47:13.231 --> 47:18.067
I just, uh, stepped out
for a little cup of coffee.

47:18.069 --> 47:20.102
This came for you.

47:20.104 --> 47:22.238
It's from geri.

47:31.983 --> 47:36.052
But... so Mr. Wright's
not available

47:36.054 --> 47:37.386
until tomorrow morning.

47:37.388 --> 47:40.189
You're sure there's nothing
later today?

47:40.191 --> 47:42.558
Darce, I gotta get back.
I can't stay away that long.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.596
Shh, shh!
Uh-huh, yeah, of course.

47:46.598 --> 47:48.898
He's only got
one spot free tomorrow.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.299
I can't do that.

47:50.301 --> 47:53.269
Mm-hmm, yeah,
well, I'm in meridian,

47:53.271 --> 47:55.404
but I have contacts
in Jackson and hattiesburg,

47:55.406 --> 48:00.643
and we would just love to get
a Mississippi franchise going.

48:00.645 --> 48:03.946
Great. 11:30?

48:05.048 --> 48:08.017
Yes,
my name is Addie bundren.

48:08.019 --> 48:10.386
Yes, I will see you then.

48:10.388 --> 48:13.022
Where in the hell did you get
that crazy name from?

48:13.024 --> 48:16.993
Faulkner.
- Relax that smart thing, baby.

48:21.531 --> 48:24.934
why are you always asking me
to be specific?

48:24.936 --> 48:26.669
You know
that's not how I operate.

48:26.671 --> 48:29.438
Oh, I think you're
very specific, Darcy.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.474
You just don't like
to admit that you are.

48:31.476 --> 48:34.176
It goes against the image
you like to promote.

48:34.178 --> 48:36.946
And what's that?

48:36.948 --> 48:38.648
Free spirit.

48:40.350 --> 48:44.353
I do consider myself
something of a free spirit.

48:44.355 --> 48:47.523
Nothing about
your spirit is free.

49:14.118 --> 49:17.153
you just have to trust me
that it was pressing.

49:17.155 --> 49:18.354
You know I'm not the type...

49:18.356 --> 49:22.992
<i>please insert 25 cents
for another three minutes.</i>

49:24.428 --> 49:28.331
You know I'm not the type
of person to just...

49:28.333 --> 49:31.000
no,
of course I understand.

49:31.368 --> 49:35.705
Well, I'll think real hard
about what you said.

49:37.441 --> 49:39.141
All right.

49:39.143 --> 49:41.978
See you back in the office.

49:49.519 --> 49:51.187
Want me to wrap that up?
- Oh, yeah.

49:51.189 --> 49:54.991
I'd like to finish my food
if you don't mind.

49:56.259 --> 49:59.328
That he was going to have
to bring in another assistant

49:59.330 --> 50:01.564
to fix it,
and that I know full well

50:01.566 --> 50:02.698
what the situation is

50:02.700 --> 50:05.134
and do I want to hang onto
my job or not?

50:05.136 --> 50:07.069
Well, do you?
- Of course I do.

50:07.071 --> 50:09.705
What about your application?
- What about it?

50:09.707 --> 50:10.506
I talked to geri.

50:10.508 --> 50:13.242
She says if you finish it up
by Friday, she can sneak it in.

50:13.244 --> 50:16.412
You just gotta finish it.

50:23.653 --> 50:25.755
I thought you wanted to make
something more of yourself.

50:25.757 --> 50:27.390
That's what
you've been saying to me

50:27.392 --> 50:29.025
for god knows
how many years now.

50:29.027 --> 50:31.127
So don't you sit there
and just throw up your hands

50:31.129 --> 50:32.628
and let this opportunity
pass you by.

50:32.630 --> 50:35.264
You can still fix it.
Just turn around.

50:35.266 --> 50:38.200
And not go find
buford lapierre?

50:38.202 --> 50:39.602
We're only about 25 miles away.

50:39.604 --> 50:42.671
Are you suggesting I skip
going to New Orleans altogether?

50:42.673 --> 50:45.541
What the hell did we come
all this way for then?

50:55.819 --> 50:59.355
<i> A couple days ago,
the army corps of engineers</i>

50:59.357 --> 51:00.523
<i>opened up the spillway</i>

51:00.525 --> 51:03.626
<i>to take some of the pressure
off the Mississippi.</i>

51:03.628 --> 51:05.795
<i>They divert the excess water</i>

51:05.797 --> 51:07.329
<i>right into
the atchafalaya river.</i>

51:07.331 --> 51:10.533
<i> Yeah, and that means
that the low-lying towns,</i>

51:10.535 --> 51:11.634
<i>they just flood out.</i>

51:11.636 --> 51:13.536
<i> Well, our neighbors
in the north, Mississippi,</i>

51:13.538 --> 51:16.672
<i>Georgia, Alabama,
and the carolinas and beyond</i>

51:16.674 --> 51:18.507
<i>aren't getting a drop
of rain,</i>

51:18.509 --> 51:21.844
<i>but down here in Louisiana,
the low-lying parishes</i>

51:21.846 --> 51:24.580
<i>the water's rising real fast,
folks.</i>

51:24.582 --> 51:27.083
<i>So I need ask you,
what would you take from home</i>

51:27.085 --> 51:31.253
<i>if somebody gave you
just 30 minutes to evacuate?</i>

51:32.556 --> 51:34.190
Hey!

51:34.192 --> 51:36.625
How do I go about
getting on that road?

51:36.627 --> 51:39.261
Where are y'all headed?
- Simone city.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.363
No, you can't
go down there, ma'am.

51:41.365 --> 51:43.232
The whole damn parish
is flooded out.

51:43.234 --> 51:44.667
But I got somebody
i gotta meet.

51:44.669 --> 51:47.870
Well, you got to turn around
and go back the way you come.

51:47.872 --> 51:50.272
Take a left down
at the end of this road.

51:50.274 --> 51:50.706
Uh-huh.

51:50.708 --> 51:52.608
Then follow it all
the way down till it ends again.

51:52.610 --> 51:55.845
Then ask somebody where
the Saint Luke church is.

51:55.847 --> 51:57.813
All right.
- All right then, yeah?

51:57.815 --> 52:00.616
Thanks a lot.
- Y'all be careful.

52:52.936 --> 52:55.404
Buford lapierre?

53:02.579 --> 53:05.481
Any of y'all know
a buford lapierre?

53:05.749 --> 53:08.751
Do y'all know when you
can get some shelter?

53:08.753 --> 53:09.785
Church is full up.

53:09.787 --> 53:11.954
They said they're gonna
bus us somewhere.

53:11.956 --> 53:15.624
Buford lapierre!
- Who wants him?

53:17.861 --> 53:20.396
They told me my <i> grandpere</i>
was coming on the next bus.

53:20.398 --> 53:23.532
But we ain't seen him.
My baby's hungry.

53:23.534 --> 53:25.401
My wife's trying to get
her asthma meds.

53:25.403 --> 53:26.735
What I'm trying to say
is that right now,

53:26.737 --> 53:29.371
I can't be bothering about
something out of the past.

53:29.373 --> 53:31.407
Ain't no concern
of mine.

53:31.409 --> 53:34.343
I-i know, it's just...

53:34.345 --> 53:37.513
I drove all this way
to speak with you.

53:37.515 --> 53:39.215
So I'm just...

53:39.217 --> 53:41.550
I'm asking you kindly
if you'll recollect

53:41.552 --> 53:46.255
anything about my boy...
- I recollect what matters to me.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.991
No! Please wait.

53:51.761 --> 53:54.730
Try to remember
how he happened

53:54.732 --> 53:59.301
to walk out of that room with
a box of bullets in his hand.

54:01.671 --> 54:06.508
We were partying that night.
What can I say about that?

54:06.510 --> 54:08.010
I'm straight edge now, though.

54:08.012 --> 54:09.945
I got nothing to do
with that stuff.

54:09.947 --> 54:13.315
I don't even like
to think about it.

54:13.317 --> 54:16.685
I will say I never liked
that guy mark.

54:16.687 --> 54:18.354
Real superior.

54:18.356 --> 54:21.257
I didn't like it that his daddy
bought him that house

54:21.259 --> 54:22.591
and I had to pay rent on it
neither.

54:22.593 --> 54:26.362
It was like that guy mark
saw the weakness in your boy,

54:26.364 --> 54:28.430
saw he was hurting
in some sense.

54:28.432 --> 54:31.000
He had so much money,
never could figure out

54:31.002 --> 54:32.434
why he wouldn't
just lend him some.

54:32.436 --> 54:35.804
Wait, Walker was trying
to borrow money?

54:35.806 --> 54:37.006
Yeah, so he could graduate.

54:37.008 --> 54:39.942
He didn't think
he was gonna make it.

54:39.944 --> 54:42.411
He was like a cat
playing with a mouse,

54:42.413 --> 54:46.415
poking at the bleeding spots,
saying stuff like,

54:46.417 --> 54:48.617
"seems like you in a lot
of pain, you in pain",

54:48.619 --> 54:51.754
and, "sometimes a tunnel
is just a tunnel",

54:51.756 --> 54:52.855
that kind of shit.

54:52.857 --> 54:54.957
I thought it was just
the drugs talking,

54:54.959 --> 54:57.026
but later I figured
that that guy saw

54:57.028 --> 55:01.397
some kind of door opening up,
just got Walker out of the way,

55:01.399 --> 55:02.931
he could step right through it.

55:02.933 --> 55:06.735
So when he drove Walker back
to town later that night...

55:06.737 --> 55:08.504
wait.

55:08.506 --> 55:11.407
Mark Wright drove Walker
to my house?

55:11.409 --> 55:13.509
None of the rest of us
had cars.

55:13.511 --> 55:18.547
Look, I don't like to say it,
but why'd anybody do that

55:18.549 --> 55:23.052
to his own mama
in her house and all?

55:24.321 --> 55:25.821
Hey!

55:55.485 --> 55:59.121
<i>Drought conditions
continue all over the south and southwest.</i>

55:59.123 --> 56:02.725
<i>Cleanup is well underway
in Saint John the baptist</i>

56:02.727 --> 56:04.760
<i>and Jefferson parishes
this evening</i>

56:04.762 --> 56:08.764
<i>as localized flood waters
continue to recede...</i>

56:08.766 --> 56:10.399
Hey, hey, baby.

56:12.369 --> 56:15.371
Crank that ac up higher,
would you, byrd?

56:15.373 --> 56:17.139
Hang on a sec.

56:19.876 --> 56:21.944
Ohh...

56:21.946 --> 56:23.011
Okay.

56:23.013 --> 56:26.448
Getting crazier by the minute.

56:26.450 --> 56:30.853
What else is new?
No, worse.

56:30.855 --> 56:32.888
I can't.

56:32.890 --> 56:34.089
It's one more day...

56:34.091 --> 56:37.459
I can hear you, goddamn it!
- Hang on.

57:35.218 --> 57:37.085
Why would you elect
to sit out here

57:37.087 --> 57:39.755
instead of staying inside
where it's cool?

57:39.757 --> 57:43.091
Wanted to give you
some privacy.

57:43.093 --> 57:45.894
How's geri?
- Ticked off at you.

57:45.896 --> 57:48.664
I'll take you both out
to the chatterbox for dinner

57:48.666 --> 57:51.467
when we get back,
my treat.

57:52.602 --> 57:55.137
You know, today when I was
talking to buford,

57:55.139 --> 57:58.740
I was trying to get him to
remember something about Walker,

57:58.742 --> 58:03.479
and it put me back
into that room that night.

58:03.481 --> 58:08.517
I started...
Remembering his toes.

58:08.519 --> 58:09.618
They were all curled up,

58:09.620 --> 58:11.720
and I was standing
at the foot of his bed

58:11.722 --> 58:14.223
trying to straighten them out,
and they...

58:14.225 --> 58:17.125
they would not straighten.

58:17.127 --> 58:22.231
I guess I stood there
for a long time, but...

58:22.233 --> 58:24.967
Maybe it was only
a couple of minutes,

58:24.969 --> 58:28.103
the way he was laying there
and all the blood, and...

58:28.105 --> 58:33.942
and me looking for a note,
and there wasn't a note.

58:33.944 --> 58:35.210
And...

58:35.212 --> 58:39.047
One side of his briefs
were kind of pulled down,

58:39.049 --> 58:41.984
and I could see...

58:41.986 --> 58:45.187
His birthmark,
that weird brown mark.

58:45.189 --> 58:48.123
That was shaped like a smile.
- Huh?

58:48.125 --> 58:50.859
Nothing.
- No.

58:50.861 --> 58:54.129
You said his birthmark
was shaped like a smile.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.265
That was...

58:58.968 --> 59:01.270
...in a real private area
of his body.

59:01.272 --> 59:02.538
How would you know that?

59:02.540 --> 59:07.075
Well, I saw him changing when
we went swimming at the shore.

59:07.077 --> 59:08.844
Uh-huh.

59:10.113 --> 59:11.780
And that's it?

59:11.782 --> 59:13.615
What else could it be?

59:13.617 --> 59:16.585
Well, I don't know,
birdie byrd.

59:16.587 --> 59:18.253
You tell me.

59:20.290 --> 59:22.324
Nothing to tell.

59:42.245 --> 59:45.681
Okay, okay, okay.
There was this period of time...

59:45.683 --> 59:48.584
oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

59:48.586 --> 59:49.985
It wasn't like he was a kid.
He was 23.

59:49.987 --> 59:51.853
So that made you what,
how old?

59:51.855 --> 59:53.255
I don't know,
32, I guess.

59:53.257 --> 59:56.592
Look, I didn't know how to talk
to you about it when it happened,

59:56.594 --> 59:57.759
and then Walker passed,
and now...

59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.729
I never wanted to tell you.
I knew you'd blow your stack.

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:03.799
So this is about
how I'd react?

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:05.233
Jesus Christ, byrd!

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:08.203
You've been in that truck with
me for how many hours,

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:11.106
and didn't think to...
oh, now I get it.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.240
Now I get it.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:14.176
You were just coming along
for the ride

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.177
because you were atoning.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:18.246
No, no, what the hell would
i need to atone for, Darcy?

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.983
Isn't it obvious?
- No, no, it is not.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.784
Here's some news for you...
other people cared

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.620
about Walker, too,
and they had their own reasons.

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:27.089
Not everything has to do with you.
- Excuse me?

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.958
You don't think I had to ask
myself some questions

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.993
when Walker died?

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:33.829
I didn't even realize
how much he was keeping from me.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:36.732
He talked to me about
the stars and the moon

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:37.799
and theories of the universe.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.668
For god's sake, do you know
how many times I had to

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:42.104
ask myself why he didn't come
over and see me that night?

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:44.406
I was right across the street.
- No, you were not.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:47.009
When I called you,
you were at your sister's.

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:49.645
That was a whole day later.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:58.220
So how did it...

01:00:58.222 --> 01:00:59.721
how'd it get started?

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:02.691
I don't want to get
into that.

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:04.292
I'm sorry.
I gotta know.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:08.930
Well, not that I think you have
any right to this information,

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:10.232
but look, I was lonely.

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:11.199
Walker was lonely, too.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:12.934
He was starting to get
those mood swings,

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:15.170
and I think maybe at first,
he just needed the company.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.072
And you were all caught up
with Clay, in case you forgot,

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:18.907
and you didn't really
want Walker around too much,

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:22.811
also in case you forgot.
- So I wasn't supposed to have a boyfriend?

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:24.112
And Walker wasn't
supposed to have

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:25.347
his own life,
his own feelings?

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:28.083
He wasn't carved out of stone
in your mirror image, you know.

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:29.317
We were like two peas
in a pod.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.353
That's exactly
what I'm talking about, Darcy!

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:35.724
It's like the way you see the
world's the only way to see it.

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:36.925
It's like some cardinal truth.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.760
But that's just the story
you've been telling yourself.

01:01:38.762 --> 01:01:41.129
That doesn't mean that's
how it actually was.

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.164
I was there.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:45.233
Sometimes Walker hated your guts
just like any kid does.

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:50.439
Sometimes he tried
to make himself

01:01:50.441 --> 01:01:51.940
as different from you
as he could.

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.341
Is it any surprise
his apartment

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:57.412
only had brand-new stuff in it,
nothing old or remotely antique?

01:01:57.414 --> 01:02:00.315
Is it any surprise
he voted republican twice?

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:05.454
So what you're telling me
is I was a shitty mother.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:07.289
No.
- Just say it then.

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:10.192
Say I was shitty and selfish
and I let my son

01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:11.993
slip through my fingers
and that I didn't see

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:14.029
a goddamn thing
that was going on with him

01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:15.864
when he was staring me
in the face.

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:20.235
Darcy, he was depressed.
- I know that.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.103
I know.

01:02:21.105 --> 01:02:24.106
What kind of mother
doesn't grasp that

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:25.440
and doesn't try to fix it?

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:27.309
You tried.
You couldn't fix it.

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:28.443
But what you're telling me

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:31.046
is that I didn't see Walker
as he was.

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:34.850
So what was I seeing then?
- You saw the parts of him

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.418
you wanted to see,
just like we all do.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.954
You saw the parts of him
that reflected

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.489
the right way on you.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:43.158
I'm just trying to figure out
some things

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.093
about my boy
and how he died.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:45.994
Enough time passes,

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:48.396
and nobody's even gonna
remember Walker anymore.

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:52.334
That's not true.
- Well, it sure feels that way.

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:55.036
And I'm sorry if i...
if I'm not evolving

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:58.907
the way you think I should be
or Clay thinks I should be

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:01.009
or geri thinks I should...

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.780
does she know about this?

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.218
Great.
Just great.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.955
And she still doesn't think
you're a dabbler?

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.925
She loves me as I am.

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:25.967
Do you know why I came
on this trip with you, Darcy?

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:27.569
It's not because
i think you need

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:30.539
some showdown
with mark Wright.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.475
No, I came with you
because I want to see you

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:36.878
find a way to come back
and live in this world again

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.381
before you let this kill you.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:45.954
You're one of the most amazing
people I know.

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:50.892
You're so tough and so funny
and so damn smart.

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:52.360
You show me lots of ways
to think about

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:55.463
how to be a woman in this world,
and most of the time,

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:57.132
there's nobody
I'd rather talk to,

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:59.201
and that's including geri,
but you can't ask everybody

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:02.604
to keep standing by and watch
you put yourself through this.

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.973
Everybody who loves you
deserves better.

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.041
I know I do.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:08.977
I had a really good time
with Walker.

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:12.113
I cared for him a whole lot.

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:15.217
He was special.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:16.184
He was fragile.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:19.855
He was here,
and then he was gone.

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.426
All I can say is that
the small piece of life

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:26.361
that was about him and me
really got lived.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:32.434
And that's a lot.
Sometimes that's all we got.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:15.010
good luck, darce.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:56.217
How could it have
gone out already?

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:59.487
It was only a couple
of hours ago!

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:02.157
It was right
under my pillow!

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:06.261
Those papers!

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:08.430
I need those papers!

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:14.102
Now what, Darcy?

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.537
What now?!

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:13.488
I'm going
to mark's office.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.104
Excuse me, ma'am,
may I help you?

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:34.843
I'm here to see mark Wright.
Addie bundren?

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:43.184
Um, what is this here
at the bottom?

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.353
Oh, that's just a standard
clause acknowledging

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.188
that the dawg house
and its franchises

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:50.258
are the exclusive property
of Mr. Wright.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.460
Oh, okay.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:06.207
Here we go.

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:08.910
Exactly, look,
you gotta hold on right there.

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:11.279
Let them know
you mean business.

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:15.550
Uh-huh.
Yeah, you got it.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.718
I gotta fly.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.254
I'll catch you
on the flipside, buddy.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:24.759
I'm so sorry, Ms. bundren.
Come on, please take a seat.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.361
It's been a busy day
for us here,

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:29.596
but I did want to make time
to see you.

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:31.733
I've had my eye on Mississippi
for a while now.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:35.803
So, uh, you already running
restaurants down there, or?

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:41.509
I'm sorry, you want to...
you want to sit down?

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:45.180
All right,
so why do you want to put

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:48.349
Mississippi
in the dawg house?

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.553
Well...

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.787
It seems like, um,

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.858
everybody likes
a family restaurant, right?

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.826
It's a business
you can't go wrong with.

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:02.764
I mean, no matter what
the economy is like,

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:05.767
parents always want to take
their kids out to eat.

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:07.569
That's the truth.
That's the truth.

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:08.937
You could ask my wife
all about that.

01:10:08.939 --> 01:10:12.574
She says a wife just needs
to take a break every so often

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:14.309
from putting dinner
on the table.

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:16.244
Yeah.
- All right, so tell me,

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:17.445
what are you picturing,
Ms. bundren?

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:19.314
You wanna start out with the one
dawg house and build them up?

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:22.517
Well, that's the way
to a grow business, right?

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:25.887
I heard you got your start by
selling t-shirts at rock shows.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:28.856
Yeah, somebody's
been doing their homework.

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:33.294
Well, you know,
it's all there on the website.

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:37.699
I'm just curious,
where'd you get that idea from?

01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:38.566
Uh...

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:41.469
Just seemed like a natural way
to generate some capital,

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:42.537
get things moving.

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:45.873
What band did you
make shirts for?

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:51.546
Who... who's
interviewing who here, huh?

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:55.283
Oh, sorry.
Um...

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:57.318
So in terms of setting up
a franchise,

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.321
would you say that parents
are looking for a place

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:01.756
that's bright and clean
for the kids,

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.259
a place where their needs
are taken into account?

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:06.261
And then you need
to make sure the chain

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:09.264
gives back into the community
to build a brand.

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.833
I guess you can find out
just about anything

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:13.034
on the Internet these days.

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:15.270
That sounds a lot
like my business plan.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:17.939
Except it's not
your business plan.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:19.674
Pardon me?

01:11:19.676 --> 01:11:22.977
It's from a business plan,
all right.

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:25.313
But it's not yours.

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:34.055
So I'm not sure what
you're getting at, Ms...

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:38.860
Baylor, actually.
Darcy baylor.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:41.296
I guess I wasn't important
enough for you to remember,

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:42.697
but you met me
a bunch of times

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:45.433
back when you and Walker
were friends.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:49.370
I'm sorry, I did know
a Walker baylor

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:50.071
back in school but...

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:53.007
looks like you're still
doing coke.

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:55.943
A whole lot of coke.

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:57.679
Am I right?

01:11:57.681 --> 01:11:59.080
I'm calling the cops.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.915
You really want
to mix them up in this?

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:02.617
I'm sorry, ma'am,
not to be rude,

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:05.053
but take a look at yourself,
and take a look at me.

01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:07.388
Who do you think they're
gonna believe?

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.989
What the hell?

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:12.393
I am Darcy baylor,
and I am Walker baylor's mother,

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:15.830
and you are not to diminish
or belittle us,

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.632
do you understand me?

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:24.505
How much do you want?

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:25.540
Come again?

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:26.808
How much money do you want?

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:28.743
You think I'm here
for your money?

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:32.347
Don't insult me.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:35.717
I want you to tell me
what happened

01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:37.719
the day Walker died.

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:40.688
What the hell happened?

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:44.859
Every damn detail.
I need you to tell me why.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.060
Why what?

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:48.429
Why he killed himself.

01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:51.132
Why he...
i don't know why.

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:52.800
But you know
what his last hours

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:55.103
on this planet were like,
and that's what you need

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:57.071
to tell me about right now.

01:12:57.073 --> 01:13:00.842
I mean it. Now.

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:10.451
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:16.057
I guess.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.526
Okay.

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:23.564
Walker was...
he was so goddamn bummed out.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:25.099
What was he bummed out about?

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:28.569
Stuff, just...

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:29.537
I had a daddy with means.

01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:31.606
I couldn't possibly know
what he was talking about.

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.408
I was probably
gonna graduate on time.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.809
He probably wasn't
gonna make it.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:37.578
And then, what kind of job
was he gonna be able to get?

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:41.048
Could he ever get married,
have a family of his own?

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:41.783
Stuff like that.

01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:45.119
I was like, "little man,
if life is that tough,

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.789
do us all a favor,
all right, and put yourself

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.459
out of your misery because
you're bringing us down."

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:54.762
Stuff like that.
I was just messing with him.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:57.165
Shit!

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:03.738
And then, uh...

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.477
And then we all went upstairs,
and I guess I fell asleep,

01:14:09.479 --> 01:14:10.978
because when I woke up,
it was real late.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.916
It was just me and Walker
in the room at that point.

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:20.655
And he was sitting over by
the window in a rocking chair.

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:24.859
Real quiet
just rocking back and forth,

01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:26.894
looking out the window.

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:30.231
And he asked me if I'd give
him a ride back into town.

01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:32.033
I was still pretty messed up
by then.

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:34.569
But I said all right.

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:38.506
So I did.

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:42.009
I'm curious.

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:44.712
Since you were the last one
to see him alive,

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.515
what did he say to you
when you...

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:50.685
when you dropped him off
at my doorstep?

01:14:52.788 --> 01:14:54.589
It was a long time ago.

01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:56.123
Honestly, I don't recall.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:15:00.895
It was just a night
like any other night for me.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:03.064
Did you ask him...

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:08.102
What was on his mind?

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:12.273
Because I'm guessing it was
pretty obvious he was upset.

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:17.645
It was obvious
he needed somebody to talk to.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:18.880
I was at work that night.

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:20.948
I didn't get home
till it was nearly dawn.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:26.621
So did he say anything
about me by any chance?

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:28.222
I don't think so.

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:30.124
I mean, come on,
guys that age,

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:34.195
we don't talk about our moms,
you know what I mean?

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:46.541
Why'd you give him
the bullets?

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:47.742
What?
- The bullets.

01:15:47.744 --> 01:15:50.578
All these years, I've been
trying to figure it out,

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.280
and there was that
one missing piece,

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:54.916
but now it all makes sense.

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:58.319
Walker says he's given up
on his dreams,

01:15:58.321 --> 01:16:03.057
y'all get all lit up,
you go in your room,

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.560
you give him the bullets.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.061
No, oh, no, no, ma'am.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:10.231
Then you drove Walker
back to my house,

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:13.167
let him go in,
shoot himself.

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:15.336
And you got to take away
his business plan.

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.171
Perfect, right?
- No, ma'am.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:19.774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow it down now.

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:21.042
You stole everything
from my child.

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:25.146
I swear, ma'am, I swear,
i n... no, don't shoot me!

01:16:25.148 --> 01:16:27.615
I swear on my daughter
Bella's life,

01:16:27.617 --> 01:16:29.083
I never gave Walker
any bullets!

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.218
Dennis.
Remember Dennis?

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.687
Oh, my god,
please don't shoot me!

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:33.888
He told me he saw
a box of bullets

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:36.090
in Walker's hand when
he came out of your room.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.326
I had guns and ammo
lying all over the place!

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:40.261
I didn't... I didn't even keep
my bullets <i> in</i> a box!

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:42.830
What about buford?
Buford said you saw a door open up,

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:46.300
and you walked right through it.
You took Walker's plan...

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.302
my daddy told me
i had to come out of school

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:49.770
with something
to show for it!

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:52.306
After Walker passed, I guess
i figured I'd get something.

01:16:52.308 --> 01:16:55.610
I knew daddy could get behind
a restaurant chain.

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:57.945
I could make it fly, so...

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.246
So...

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:04.285
You took Walker's plan...

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:08.356
To stay out of trouble
with your daddy.

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:17.832
Then why'd you go and try
and turn yourself into Walker?

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:24.171
Getting a dog like his,

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:29.210
taking his memories,
stealing his ideas, why?

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:32.346
Didn't you have any memories
of your own?!

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:36.651
I didn't have any stories
that good.

01:17:36.653 --> 01:17:39.120
I didn't have what he had
back at that time.

01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:43.257
I didn't have anything
that seemed like it would work.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:47.161
I remember thinking
i wish my mom and me

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:49.230
could be like you two were.

01:17:49.232 --> 01:17:53.734
It's funny 'cause
he thought I had everything.

01:17:53.736 --> 01:17:55.403
At the end of the day...

01:17:55.405 --> 01:17:57.304
no, no, wait!
Please, please, please.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:01.375
What did it feel like
for him...

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:02.910
In that moment?

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:07.081
Stop!
- Cold.

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:08.449
Scary.

01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:09.884
And then...

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.452
... Black.

01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:13.354
No.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:32.313
You know, it's funny,

01:22:32.315 --> 01:22:33.681
sometimes I'll be going
down the sidewalk,

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:38.218
not thinking about
anything in particular, and...

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:48.963
I'll feel your hand
sliding into mine.

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:55.602
Even though
i know it's not there.

01:22:57.505 --> 01:23:01.608
Even though I know
it's never going to be there.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:14.588
I can't tell you
what I would give...

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:17.591
To hold your hand again.

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:25.599
My baby boy.

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:59.366
Glad to see
you made it home okay.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.568
Judging from your shirt,
looks like you still got a job.

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:06.740
I do, and you can tell geri
she can start working her magic.

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:09.176
You got it in?
Tell her yourself.

01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:11.412
She'll be out here in a sec.

01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:15.082
Well, you must be sick
of driving.

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:25.459
You could still shock
the known world and be practical

01:24:25.461 --> 01:24:28.729
and change your application to
pre-law or something like that.

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:31.432
No, I started out
studying literature,

01:24:31.434 --> 01:24:33.700
and even if I never do
a damn thing with it,

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:35.369
I know it's gonna improve me,

01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:38.072
just the way I see things
and think about things,

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:42.443
and spend some time with
some really good sentences.

01:24:42.445 --> 01:24:45.679
It's... well,
i think it's expansive.

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:49.116
Why the hell
has he changed his patterns?

01:24:49.118 --> 01:24:51.118
Whole world turned upside down
when Clayton Watson

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.686
keeps stepping out on
the main street before noon.

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:55.823
Jesus Christ, stop the car.
- You don't wanna be late.

01:24:55.825 --> 01:24:58.659
Take that.
Won't take long.
