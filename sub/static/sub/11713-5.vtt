19:25.456 --> 19:29.543
Wait, you wore that hat
voluntarily?

19:30.211 --> 19:32.546
What's wrong with it? I...

19:32.546 --> 19:34.548
Nothing.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.384
Hand me my nine iron,
Bagger Vance.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.010
[LAUGHS]

19:39.428 --> 19:43.432
You look like a newsboy
from the Depression.

19:43.432 --> 19:47.102
"Extry! Extry!"
You're a tool.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.854
[LAUGHING]

19:49.355 --> 19:52.858
You know what? We might do
all right without Russell.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.860
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

19:58.280 --> 20:00.741
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

20:01.242 --> 20:03.869
Adam, look what
my mom sent us.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.456
The future
Mr. and Mrs. Adam Rhodes.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.416
All right.
Hey, we look good.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.543
Mm-hm.
But more importantly,

20:11.543 --> 20:14.045
I look straight.

20:14.045 --> 20:15.631
Yeah, how'd you
pull that off?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.466
I had Jen punch me
in the stomach

20:17.466 --> 20:18.634
before the guy snapped it.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.178
The second punch
he really wasn't expecting.

20:22.178 --> 20:24.890
Oh, God, Adam.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.559
Look at the caption.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.604
"Jennifer Morgan to wed...

20:30.604 --> 20:33.649
Madam Rhodes"?

20:34.525 --> 20:34.941
No!

20:34.941 --> 20:37.986
No. They-- They totally ruined
my hetero picture.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.780
At least
it's a small town.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.240
Not that many people
will see it.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.201
Oh, no, they've got
an online edition.

20:45.702 --> 20:49.039
Well, I got a busy night
ahead of me, so...

20:50.416 --> 20:52.293
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

20:55.837 --> 20:58.299
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]
