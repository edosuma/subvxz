12:28.533 --> 12:31.033
An affair. A tryst.

12:31.066 --> 12:32.666
A‐a... liason.

12:34.633 --> 12:35.733
Yeah...

12:40.200 --> 12:43.166
Balki and Jennifer
are having a...

12:44.100 --> 12:47.066
...cheap, sordid, sex thing.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.333
Balki and Jennifer?

12:50.366 --> 12:52.366
I can't believe it.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.033
Balki's the sweetest
guy I ever met.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.400
And Jennifer
and I have been best friends

12:56.433 --> 12:58.533
since we were eight.

12:58.566 --> 13:00.400
How could they do this?

13:02.333 --> 13:03.800
Love hurts.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.700
Doesn't it, Mary Anne?

13:05.733 --> 13:07.166
It sure does.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.566
‐ But, Larry?
‐ Yes?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.566
Why are you so upset?

13:24.366 --> 13:25.566
He's still asleep.

13:54.941 --> 13:55.660
Good morning, cousin.

13:57.326 --> 14:00.226
Good morning, cousin.

14:00.260 --> 14:03.726
Well, you're just as smooth
as you can be, aren't you?

14:05.860 --> 14:08.660
Well, I... I do use
a moisturizer.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.260
Enough about me.

14:13.293 --> 14:15.160
You look hungry. You know what?

14:15.193 --> 14:16.893
Why don't we go
out for breakfast?

14:16.926 --> 14:19.293
Let's get you some breakfast.
And I'll buy.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.726
I'm not hungry.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.126
Well, then. Why don't we stroll?

14:22.160 --> 14:24.726
We'll just walk
down State Street

14:24.760 --> 14:27.360
that great street
and build up an appetite.

14:29.026 --> 14:30.260
Right.

14:33.726 --> 14:38.426
Cousin, don't put your
coat in this closet.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.393
Because the other day,
I saw a roach in there

14:40.426 --> 14:42.993
the size of a Winnebago.

14:43.026 --> 14:45.860
Oh, boy, was it a big roach!

14:45.893 --> 14:47.160
And... ooh! Oh, there it goes!

14:47.193 --> 14:49.860
You're going to get it.

14:49.893 --> 14:51.126
You know,
you‐you can't kill them.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.326
[muttering]

14:52.360 --> 14:53.760
[Larry]
Ok, Balki...

14:55.426 --> 14:57.893
When you're ready
to be honest with me

14:57.926 --> 14:59.160
let me know.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.726
Until then...

15:03.760 --> 15:06.826
‐ I'll be in my room.
‐ Now wait a minute, cousin!

15:06.860 --> 15:09.793
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:13.826 --> 15:17.160
Don't go to your room.

15:17.193 --> 15:19.860
Let's just... let's
just be honest.

15:19.893 --> 15:21.160
Let's sit down...

15:21.193 --> 15:24.026
...and let's just
be straightforward

15:24.060 --> 15:27.160
and honest, and...

15:27.193 --> 15:29.126
...and just let our hair down.

15:31.726 --> 15:32.926
You go first.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.826
Okay, Balki,
let's stop the charade.

15:38.860 --> 15:41.293
‐ I know what's going on.
‐ You do?

15:41.326 --> 15:44.226
Yes, I do. I know
all about you and Jennifer.

15:44.260 --> 15:45.326
Oh!

15:46.793 --> 15:49.726
You... you take my breath away!

15:52.493 --> 15:54.793
If you only knew
how hard we tried

15:54.826 --> 15:56.126
to keep it from you.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.360
Aha!

15:59.926 --> 16:01.726
So you admit it?

16:01.760 --> 16:05.226
Cousin, I am so bummed
you had to find out.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.326
Just tell me...

16:08.360 --> 16:10.893
How long has this been going on?

16:10.926 --> 16:14.193
Well, we've been kicking
around the idea a couple months.

16:14.226 --> 16:15.360
‐ Oh...
‐ But...

16:17.460 --> 16:20.360
We really didn't do anything
about it until last week.

16:22.026 --> 16:24.326
How could you
deceive me all this time?

16:24.360 --> 16:26.026
You're asking me?

16:26.060 --> 16:27.326
It wasn't easy!

16:27.360 --> 16:29.726
But, you know,
it got kind of fun

16:29.760 --> 16:31.760
when we pictured
how surprised you would be

16:31.793 --> 16:33.393
when we sprung it on you.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.193
When you sprung it on?
But wha‐wha...

16:40.226 --> 16:43.260
What were you going to do?
Send me a telegram?

16:43.293 --> 16:46.326
No, we were going
to invite you over to dinner.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.026
And then right before
the dessert come out

16:49.060 --> 16:51.893
we were going to yell, surprise!

16:54.460 --> 16:56.160
That's...

16:56.193 --> 16:58.160
That's how you were
going to tell me?

16:58.193 --> 17:00.726
That you and Jennifer
are lovers?

17:08.425 --> 17:09.992
You steal my girl...

17:10.026 --> 17:11.026
...you lie to me...

17:11.060 --> 17:14.292
And then throw me a party
to tell me about it?

17:17.859 --> 17:19.760
Have you no guilt?

17:19.792 --> 17:22.026
No shame, no remorse?

17:27.326 --> 17:29.726
Well, obviously not.

17:33.293 --> 17:34.426
Larry Appleton!

17:34.460 --> 17:35.893
Aha!

17:38.293 --> 17:40.126
How dare you talk
that way to Balki?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.893
He's your best friend.

17:41.926 --> 17:43.160
My best friend?

17:43.193 --> 17:44.826
Oh, really?

17:44.860 --> 17:47.893
Really? And Where did my best
friend take you last night, huh?

17:47.926 --> 17:49.826
Dinner? Dancing?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.993
An office supply clearance sale.

17:52.026 --> 17:53.126
Oh!

17:54.360 --> 17:55.426
Kinky.

17:59.860 --> 18:02.360
Actually, we were buying
a present for you.

18:02.393 --> 18:06.160
Oh, is that why
you were in Balki's bedroom?

18:06.193 --> 18:09.093
That's exactly why
I was in Balki's bedroom.

18:09.126 --> 18:12.426
Oh, yeah.
What...And what were you doing?

18:12.460 --> 18:13.993
Gift‐wrapping it?

18:19.726 --> 18:21.793
That's a Wellington 4000!

18:26.393 --> 18:28.126
With feather‐touch control.

18:42.893 --> 18:44.093
Ooh, boy.

18:45.093 --> 18:46.793
Aha!

18:46.826 --> 18:49.126
‐ Mary Anne!
‐ Don't you Mary Anne me.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.360
How dare you steal the man
I like a lot away from me?

18:57.287 --> 18:59.248
Mary Anne, I wasn't stealing
Balki away from you.

18:59.281 --> 19:01.948
We were shopping
for a typewriter, remember?

19:03.815 --> 19:05.315
Oh, right!

19:10.948 --> 19:14.181
Larry, they weren't having
a cheap, sordid sex thing.

19:20.981 --> 19:22.315
I know that... now.

19:23.981 --> 19:25.315
I think we'd better go.

19:26.681 --> 19:28.615
Let's talk later, Larry, okay?

19:30.015 --> 19:31.215
What's going on?

19:31.248 --> 19:33.181
Mary Anne, you never know
what's going on.

20:19.181 --> 20:21.115
[laughing]

20:22.781 --> 20:24.815
Oh! Ho ho!

20:24.848 --> 20:28.315
Oh, what crazy things...

20:28.348 --> 20:30.148
...people do...

20:30.181 --> 20:33.815
...when they
misunderstand each other!

20:33.848 --> 20:35.815
[laughs]

20:35.848 --> 20:38.748
And I mean when you think...

20:38.781 --> 20:41.181
...of the stupid things...

20:41.215 --> 20:42.281
...I did...

20:42.315 --> 20:46.915
[laughing]
...when‐when‐when
I thought you and Jen...

20:46.948 --> 20:50.181
Well, it‐it just makes you want
to laugh out loud, doesn't it?

20:50.215 --> 20:52.648
[laughs]

20:52.681 --> 20:54.648
Huh? Huh?

20:56.948 --> 20:58.015
Oh.

21:00.981 --> 21:02.381
Balki, I...

21:03.681 --> 21:05.948
...don't know what to say.

21:05.981 --> 21:09.348
I am so sorry.

21:10.781 --> 21:11.581
It's just that when...

21:11.615 --> 21:14.048
When I thought
you and Jennifer were...

21:15.148 --> 21:16.348
...involved...

21:18.148 --> 21:19.948
...I kind of...

21:20.448 --> 21:21.981
...overreacted.

21:24.948 --> 21:27.315
Kind of overreacted?

21:29.815 --> 21:32.048
Kind of overreacted?

21:32.915 --> 21:34.848
You had a meltdown.

21:39.915 --> 21:42.415
Well, I thought
you stole my girl!

21:42.448 --> 21:44.748
But you... didn't.

21:45.715 --> 21:47.648
No, I didn't.

21:47.681 --> 21:51.181
You were buying me
a Wellington 4000.

21:51.215 --> 21:53.181
With feather‐touch control.

21:54.948 --> 21:57.315
Why would you do that?

21:57.348 --> 22:00.148
It's not my birthday,
it's not Christmas.

22:00.181 --> 22:03.715
Why would you
buy this for me?

22:03.748 --> 22:06.248
Why would I buy this for you?

22:06.281 --> 22:10.248
Why would your best friend,
buy you a present?

22:10.281 --> 22:13.381
What am I? The first
best friend you've ever had?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.848
[whispers]
Oh, boy.

22:14.881 --> 22:16.881
Am I the first
best friend you ever had?

22:16.915 --> 22:18.148
[whispers]
Oh, boy.

22:22.681 --> 22:25.281
I am the first
best friend you ever had.

22:28.048 --> 22:29.148
Maybe.

22:32.748 --> 22:34.248
But... I guess...

22:36.148 --> 22:39.081
...after what I did,
that's all over, huh?

22:39.115 --> 22:40.781
Oh, cousin.

22:41.948 --> 22:45.215
Cousin, so much to teach you...

22:45.248 --> 22:47.048
...so little time.

22:48.715 --> 22:49.815
[instrumental music]

22:49.848 --> 22:52.081
Of course
our friendship isn't over.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.848
Best friends forgive each other.

22:56.115 --> 22:57.348
And I forgive you.

23:04.015 --> 23:07.848
Now, let's open this baby up
and see what she can do.

23:07.881 --> 23:10.848
No, Balki.
I don't deserve that.

23:10.881 --> 23:12.748
Oh, cousin, please take it.

23:12.781 --> 23:13.781
No, I can't.

23:13.815 --> 23:15.281
‐ Please take it!
‐ I can't.

23:15.315 --> 23:16.948
‐ Take it! Take it!
‐ I can't, no.

23:16.981 --> 23:18.648
‐ Take it!
‐ I can't, I can't...

23:18.681 --> 23:20.615
Take the typewriter!

23:26.381 --> 23:29.348
It's a gift from a friend.

23:34.181 --> 23:35.381
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.
