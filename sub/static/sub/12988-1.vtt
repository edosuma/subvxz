- % [Soft Trumpet]
- [Woman] I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

00:21.668 --> 00:24.262
Really terrific. And I go
and hear him jam every month or so.

00:24.338 --> 00:27.796
And he plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

00:27.874 --> 00:32.174
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

00:32.244 --> 00:36.238
And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

00:36.316 --> 00:38.784
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

00:38.852 --> 00:43.050
how the music made me feel
and how his playing made me feel.

00:43.123 --> 00:46.092
And he just kept shakin'
his head, and he said...

00:46.159 --> 00:48.150
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

00:48.228 --> 00:52.096
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

00:52.165 --> 00:54.861
I just said, "Well, gonna
get all philosophical on me.

00:54.935 --> 00:56.869
It's just as pointless as
talking about a lot of things.

00:56.937 --> 00:58.871
Love, for instance."

00:58.939 --> 01:02.705
And my friend laughed, and he said,
"Definitely. Most definitely.

01:02.776 --> 01:06.473
Talking about love is
like dancing about architecture."

01:08.081 --> 01:11.949
So I don't know.
He might be right.

01:12.018 --> 01:14.179
But it ain't gonna stop me from trying.

- No.

used to make you laugh.

- We have to talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

- Yeah.

He claims you have
no personal life whatsoever.

05:22.369 --> 05:24.496
I say that's impossible.

my wife Leann--

08:11.271 --> 08:13.398
It was about 3:00.

to, uh, soccer practice.

08:19.813 --> 08:24.182
Uh, I had a meeting at a bar.

08:24.250 --> 08:28.584

than usual-- standard four-drink buzz.

08:28.655 --> 08:30.589
Maybe five.

08:32.325 --> 08:37.159

at the Pizza Hut.

I was driving fast.

08:48.174 --> 08:51.803
Not too fast, I think.

08:53.346 --> 08:56.281
The light, it just turned.

08:58.251 --> 09:00.185
It was red for only a second.

09:00.253 --> 09:02.278
Less than.
I swear.

09:04.891 --> 09:06.825
I ran the light.

09:09.762 --> 09:11.889
I saw the car.

09:11.965 --> 09:14.593
I hit my wife's car.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.601
Oh, my God.

09:16.669 --> 09:20.605
I saw her face through the windshield
just as I hit them.

09:23.109 --> 09:26.101
She saw me.

09:26.179 --> 09:28.841
She knew it was me.

09:30.049 --> 09:31.983
Oh.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.344
You shouldn't be alone.

09:36.723 --> 09:38.748
Yes, I should.

That's where I am.

Twenty minutes at 350 degrees

No more, no less.

10:22.769 --> 10:26.398
And the delicacy of this fish
is best appreciated by its taste...

10:26.472 --> 10:29.703
not necessarily by its appearance.

10:29.776 --> 10:31.801
Once you remove the fish
from the oven...

10:33.813 --> 10:37.078
transfer it directly
onto a heated plate.

what goes on in the kitchen.

Nothing.

11:31.504 --> 11:35.167
- Stop what?
- Organizing things.

11:35.241 --> 11:38.699
- Oh, I'll stop if it bothers you.
- No.

11:38.778 --> 11:41.770
It doesn't bother me.
It takes me back.

Sit next to me.

11:58.564 --> 12:00.998

for you to find out, huh?

12:01.067 --> 12:04.161
- Find out what?
- Well, that I'm gay, for one.

12:06.039 --> 12:08.530
Come on.
You never suspected?

12:08.608 --> 12:12.510
- You were always so good at sports.
- [Chuckles] Mom!

12:12.578 --> 12:17.038
I'm really glad you're here.

12:18.551 --> 12:21.850
- And what's the second thing?
- What second thing?

12:21.921 --> 12:26.187
You said it was a hell of a way
for me to find out that you
were gay for "one" thing.

12:26.259 --> 12:28.693
- So what's the second thing?
- That I'm dying.

12:28.761 --> 12:32.561
- Don't say that!
- Oh, stop! I can't go back into
our classic mother-son pattern.

12:32.632 --> 12:37.729
Okay? I can't play the Iverson family
game of denying reality...

12:37.804 --> 12:40.398
- where reality is over there,
somewhere...
- Oh, honey, don't.

12:40.473 --> 12:43.772
and we hide from it over here
and pretend it doesn't exist.

12:43.843 --> 12:47.677
Okay? It takes too much energy.
Energy that I don't have.

12:47.747 --> 12:49.942
All right. Maybe I don't either...
have the energy.

12:50.016 --> 12:52.007
God, that would be good.

the last of my small crowd.

13:49.175 --> 13:53.737
The geniuses at Pacific Motors
have now decided to spotlight the car...

13:53.813 --> 13:55.747
and dumb down the concept.

13:55.815 --> 14:00.479
- No Fellini?
- Who? Most definitely no Fellini.

- Uh, are you okay?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
I landed on a stack of George.

14:32.051 --> 14:35.145
- Plenty of padding.
- Meet the architect.

14:35.221 --> 14:39.351
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

14:39.425 --> 14:42.917
- If I can just find one,
Theater Week is on me.
- And dinner is on me.

14:42.995 --> 14:46.954
- No, no. Not necessary. Truly.
- Please. I insist.
It's the least I can do. I mean--

14:47.033 --> 14:50.400
- Look, I'm not gonna sue you, okay?
- I didn't think you were gonna sue me.

14:52.872 --> 14:55.636
Not that I couldn't, mind you.
But something tells me...

14:55.708 --> 14:58.973
that you'd be able to convince
the jury that this was my fault.

14:59.045 --> 15:03.846
You know I'm not just asking you
to dinner as a preemptive strike
against litigation.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.407
- I'm asking because--
- I'll have dinner with you.

15:08.087 --> 15:11.318
- What changed your mind?
- Anybody who can say
"preemptive strike...

15:11.390 --> 15:14.484
against litigation" with a straight face
deserves a dinner companion.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.393
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

15:18.598 --> 15:20.088
This is last week's.

15:20.233 --> 15:23.930
I'm thinking of putting
the show on hiatus.

15:24.003 --> 15:26.597
And I'm thinking
you'll do no such thing.

15:26.672 --> 15:32.008
- But, Paul--
- No. I don't want anything
to be any different.

15:32.078 --> 15:35.809
- Things are different.
- I don't want to have a fight with you.

15:35.881 --> 15:39.078
I don't want a fight. I just--
I just want to talk and make--

15:39.151 --> 15:43.485
Look. What about what I want?
You've always controlled everything:

15:43.556 --> 15:45.547
your shows, the kids.

15:45.625 --> 15:48.355
Stop trying to control me.

15:48.427 --> 15:50.418
I'm not trying
to control anybody.

15:50.496 --> 15:53.294
- I just think maybe--
- Don't think.

15:53.366 --> 15:57.166
Let us just proceed as if
nothing has changed. All right?

16:01.374 --> 16:05.435
- I don't know if I can do that.
- You have no choice.

to become an alcoholic.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.179
I feed the fucking thing.
I take her to the vet.

16:50.256 --> 16:52.383
All you do is pet her twice a day.

16:52.458 --> 16:55.359
Which is a hell of a lot more
than you've been doing to me lately.

16:55.428 --> 16:57.589
Okay, let's discuss this calmly.

16:57.663 --> 17:01.429
We're adults.
We've been together a long time.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.866
Well, not a long time,
but an adequate four months.

17:03.936 --> 17:07.804
Adequate until you fuckin' cheated on me
with that skag from Bloomingdale's!

17:07.873 --> 17:09.807
You fu--
Harry?

17:09.875 --> 17:13.538
Don't you dare hang up.
Harry! Harry?

17:14.814 --> 17:17.305
Shit! Shit.

17:24.656 --> 17:27.251
Hi. You got a quarter?

17:31.864 --> 17:33.798
Thank you.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.205
The fucking cat is mine.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.173
No, no.
On this I'm not negotiable, Harry.

17:45.244 --> 17:48.179
Harry. Hey! Hey!
Don't be a fuckin' infant, okay?

17:48.247 --> 17:52.206
You can take anything that came
from IKEA. I want the cat,
and I want Pottery Barn.

17:52.284 --> 17:54.718
It--
One more time.

17:54.787 --> 17:57.688
You hang up one more time and l--
[Slams Down Receiver]

17:57.757 --> 17:59.691
Damn it.

18:03.295 --> 18:05.923
- It's my last one.
- Negotiations are almost over.

18:07.967 --> 18:09.901
Thank you.

18:14.140 --> 18:17.473
All right. Okay, scumbag.
You're robbing me blind...

18:17.543 --> 18:21.343
but I will give up Pottery Barn
if I can just have the cat.

18:22.848 --> 18:26.215
No! No. Pottery Barn does not
include Williams Sonoma.

18:26.285 --> 18:29.482
They're two separate
establishments, Harry.

18:29.555 --> 18:31.989
Oh, Christ on crutches!
Okay, you know what, Harry?

18:32.057 --> 18:36.016
I want to get rid of you as much as l
want to get rid of that junk from IKEA.

18:36.095 --> 18:38.529
So here's the thing.

18:38.597 --> 18:42.590
You can walk away with Pottery Barn,
Williams Sonoma, IKEA.

18:42.668 --> 18:47.537
And just to show you that I'm
a grown-up, I will throw in all
the crap from Hold Everything!

18:47.606 --> 18:50.404
Yeah! Yeah, that includes
the hanging shoe sorter.

18:50.476 --> 18:54.344
That's right.
Do we have a deal? Great.

18:54.413 --> 18:57.507
So here's the thing.
I will be home in two hours.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.916
You and all your junk
from the catalogs will be gone...

19:00.986 --> 19:03.614
and the cat will be there waiting
for me, purring contentedly.

19:07.626 --> 19:11.756
Well, the least I can do
after taking your last quarter
is let you buy me a drink.

19:24.610 --> 19:27.636
I work in the Twin Towers.
Entertainment law.

19:29.748 --> 19:32.148
- And you?
- Me?

19:32.218 --> 19:34.345
I'm not very good company.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

19:36.722 --> 19:38.656
No problem.

19:42.194 --> 19:45.322
- I'm not gonna bother you.
- Uh, don't go. l-l-I'm sorry.

19:45.397 --> 19:48.332
- No, I'm sorry. Really.
- Again, I'm sorry.

19:50.603 --> 19:53.902
- You've had a bad day.
- A killer.

19:53.973 --> 19:58.239
You know, yesterday I would have
said that things couldn't
possibly get any worse.

19:58.310 --> 20:00.744
They sure as hell
got worse today.

20:02.314 --> 20:06.148
I'm, uh--
I work in the, uh, Twin Towers too.

20:06.218 --> 20:09.710
I'm a development executive
over at ABC.

20:09.788 --> 20:13.554
I'm responsible for all those shit shows
that you don't watch on Thursday night.

20:13.626 --> 20:15.992
You're to blame for those?

20:16.061 --> 20:18.427
- Afraid so.
- [Laughs]

20:18.497 --> 20:20.431
Everybody blames me.

20:20.499 --> 20:24.458
My boss, my wife, my secretary.

20:24.537 --> 20:26.471
Hell, even my kids.
They watch NBC.

20:26.539 --> 20:30.270
And I work like a dog...

20:30.342 --> 20:34.039
trying to find some way to fix
the Thursday night schedule.

20:37.950 --> 20:40.680
Well, I don't find a way to fix
the Thursday night schedule...

20:40.753 --> 20:42.880
and my boss,
today he tells me...

20:42.955 --> 20:46.857
that coming into the office
tomorrow isn't necessary.

20:46.926 --> 20:51.659
Or coming in ever again,
for that matter.

20:53.499 --> 20:56.991
[Sighs] I wish you could
spend the night.

20:57.069 --> 20:59.003
You know I can't.

21:00.439 --> 21:02.566
- Is this all you want from us?
- Roger...

21:02.641 --> 21:06.168
and I mean this really sweetly,
there isn't any us.

21:06.245 --> 21:10.045
- Mmm. There's only this.
- Well, this could be different.

21:10.115 --> 21:12.242
Well, anything
can be different.

21:12.318 --> 21:14.479
But I don't want this to be.

21:14.553 --> 21:19.422
I want it to be what it is:
two very sexually compatible
people enjoying each other...

21:19.491 --> 21:22.892
with no obligations,
no complications...

21:22.962 --> 21:25.260
no individual history,
no mutual history...

21:25.331 --> 21:27.765
[Slaps Roger]
and no guilt.

21:27.833 --> 21:30.324
- That's awfully cold.
- It's awfully realistic.

21:30.402 --> 21:33.428
- I know you don't love your husband.
- Oh, but I know...

21:33.505 --> 21:36.133
that you do love your wife.

21:41.046 --> 21:43.480
I'll have a vodka martini,
very dry and straight up...

21:43.549 --> 21:48.577
- with three olives,
and my sullen friend here will have--
- A Coke.

21:48.654 --> 21:52.283
The poster boy for designated drivers
will have a Coke.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.222
- The guy on the phone?
- Harry.

21:57.296 --> 21:59.787
Harry, right.
We were together for five months.

21:59.865 --> 22:02.425
- I thought it was four.
- You were paying attention.

22:02.501 --> 22:04.765
Everyone in this club
was paying attention.

22:04.837 --> 22:07.271
We were together for five months.
But I knew it wasn't gonna work out...

22:07.339 --> 22:10.900
'cause the first time he comes over
I find out that he sits down to pee.

22:10.976 --> 22:14.434
- You don't do that, do you?
- No.

22:14.513 --> 22:16.481
So fuckin' lazy.
And in my experience...

22:16.548 --> 22:20.177
it extends to other aspects
of an individual's personality.

22:20.252 --> 22:25.087
Last time I saw him, Harry was wearing a
blue sweater and an idiotic expression.

22:25.157 --> 22:27.557
The sweater was new.

22:27.626 --> 22:29.787
Here's to good riddance Harry.

22:30.863 --> 22:32.797
Good riddance Harry.

22:42.107 --> 22:44.974
Hey, again please.

22:45.044 --> 22:48.207
And drier this time,
and three olives, not two.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.714
Three.
Nutritional value.

22:50.783 --> 22:52.774
Now, where were we?
Oh, so Harry.

22:52.851 --> 22:55.183
Right.

22:55.254 --> 22:57.313
The sex part wasn't bad.

22:57.389 --> 22:59.323
You know, for a while.

22:59.391 --> 23:04.488
And then his consummate laziness
and lack of imagination
became tediously self-evident.

23:04.563 --> 23:09.557
Every time, everything was
exactly the same as the time previous.

23:09.635 --> 23:13.935
It was as if he had followed
some step-by-step instructional video.

23:14.006 --> 23:17.498
And about two weeks ago,
guess what I found in the apartment.

23:17.576 --> 23:22.570
- A step-by-step instructional video.
- Right! Here's the topper.

23:22.648 --> 23:25.708
I timed his performance
one night. Right?

23:25.784 --> 23:29.151
And then I checked the running time
on the video. And guess what.

23:29.221 --> 23:31.815
- To the minute.
- Right down to it.

23:31.890 --> 23:33.824
Twenty-three minutes, to be exact.

23:33.892 --> 23:35.826
Including credits.

23:36.895 --> 23:40.456
Anyway, he's history.

23:40.532 --> 23:43.626
- But I still have Blanche.
- Who would be the cat.

23:43.702 --> 23:46.193
Oh, a great cat.
Very feline.

23:46.271 --> 23:48.364
The best cats are.

23:48.440 --> 23:52.001
Blanche can look at you with a gaze
of unflappable superiority...

23:52.077 --> 23:56.480
that seems to spring from near total
detachment and disinterest.

23:57.916 --> 24:00.680
Not unlike
how you're looking at me now.

24:04.890 --> 24:06.824
Thank you.

24:08.761 --> 24:11.491
You don't say very much, do you?

24:11.563 --> 24:15.499
- Does anyone, when they're with you?
- Don't get mean.

24:17.536 --> 24:21.597
We don't know each other well enough
yet. When we do, then you can get mean.

24:24.510 --> 24:26.774
So we should do this again sometime.

24:26.845 --> 24:30.303
- We're not doing anything.
- Okay. Then let's not do this.

24:30.382 --> 24:33.010
Let's do something else.

24:33.085 --> 24:35.383
I'll even let you be the man.
You can decide where we go on our date.

24:37.623 --> 24:40.456
I don't date.

24:40.526 --> 24:44.292
Well. Gee, I don't have
a witty comeback for that one.

24:44.363 --> 24:46.627
I mean, I'm used to
any number of brush-offs...

24:46.698 --> 24:49.166
but that's, uh, that's a new one.

24:49.234 --> 24:52.203
Doesn't date.

24:52.271 --> 24:55.729
I'll admit I've seen you around. You're
always-- You're always dancing alone.

24:57.576 --> 25:00.409
- That's the way I like it.
- Why is that?

25:02.781 --> 25:05.011
I don't want to be
rude or unkind...

25:05.083 --> 25:07.517
or... mean.

25:09.788 --> 25:13.087
But I just don't come out with my entire
life story over martinis and a Coke.

25:16.829 --> 25:19.229
I'm sorry, really.

25:19.298 --> 25:21.823
Your cat's lucky to have you.

25:29.908 --> 25:33.344
My wife had moved them out.

25:33.412 --> 25:36.210
Moved everything out.
Left a note.

25:36.281 --> 25:38.613
Very thoughtful.
Didn't realize she felt that way.

25:38.684 --> 25:40.515
What way?

25:44.323 --> 25:46.791
That I was a failure.

25:46.859 --> 25:50.659
Not only professionally,
but personally as well.

25:50.729 --> 25:54.563
Just like ABC no longer required
my services. She let me know...

25:54.633 --> 26:00.071
that she and the kids no longer
required my services or my presence.

26:00.138 --> 26:04.234
It turns out she's been
seeing some guy for a year...

26:04.309 --> 26:07.437
for a fucking year,
and I never suspected a thing.

26:07.512 --> 26:09.810
- And you know what the worst of it is?
- What?

26:09.882 --> 26:12.680
The guy that she left me for?
The fucker works for NBC!

26:12.751 --> 26:16.187
He's got my wife and my kids,
my cat and my dog...

26:16.255 --> 26:20.021
and he doesn't have to lose
any sleep over the Thursday
night fucking schedule!

26:28.400 --> 26:30.630
Honey?

26:30.702 --> 26:34.570
You should come to bed.
What are you working on so late?

26:34.640 --> 26:36.972
I was just checking on
your TV residuals.

26:37.042 --> 26:39.442
They're still robbing us blind.

26:39.511 --> 26:42.605
I happen to know you're
a tremendous hit on WWFU.

26:42.681 --> 26:44.376
Which is where?

26:44.449 --> 26:46.610
Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

26:46.685 --> 26:49.210
Oh, Intercourse.

26:49.288 --> 26:51.756
And they can't get enough
of you in Intercourse.

26:51.823 --> 26:53.757
And I know exactly
how they feel.

26:55.694 --> 26:58.424
- Bed.
- [Imitates Dog Panting]

26:59.865 --> 27:02.595
- Come on, Molly. Come on, Crackers.
- [Dog Whimpers]

27:11.143 --> 27:14.169
[Waiter]
There you are, sir. Okay?

27:14.246 --> 27:18.478
- Cheers.
- I've been meaning to ask you
about your wedding ring.

27:21.053 --> 27:24.955
It's really just force
of habit. l, uh...

27:25.023 --> 27:29.255
divorced...
four chilling years ago.

27:30.329 --> 27:33.059
- Acrimonious?
- No.

27:33.131 --> 27:36.328
Oh, wait, that means
hostile and bitter. Yes.

27:36.401 --> 27:40.269
In the divorce papers she referred to me
as the "architect of her misfortune."

27:41.373 --> 27:45.002
- Ouch.
- Yeah. No kids, luckily.

27:45.077 --> 27:49.673
I wanted them,
but she didn't.

27:49.748 --> 27:51.682
- You know, if this makes you
uncomfortable--
- No.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.082
- I can take it off, the ring.
It's not a problem.
- No, no. Stop.

27:54.152 --> 27:58.612
Don't be silly.
That would be two of us being silly.

27:58.690 --> 28:02.717
I really only wear it to keep
the construction guys from harassing me.

28:03.996 --> 28:06.692
- Does it work?
- [Chuckles]

28:06.765 --> 28:09.825
Depends on what I'm wearing.
[Chuckles]

28:12.371 --> 28:16.432
[Sighs] I think you can tell
that I'm not very good at this.

28:19.111 --> 28:22.342
- You're charming.
- [Laughs]

28:23.582 --> 28:27.313
- And real.
- [Laughing]

28:27.386 --> 28:29.854
Lovely.

28:29.921 --> 28:32.219
What did I say?

28:32.290 --> 28:34.349
Nothing.

28:34.426 --> 28:36.417
No, no. Nothing.

28:36.495 --> 28:39.589
I just, um--

28:39.664 --> 28:44.795
Before I came here tonight,
I was discussing you with my sister.

28:44.870 --> 28:48.362
We were coming up with
a psychological profile.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.374
Several, actually.

28:50.442 --> 28:54.310
- And which did I fit into?
- Oh, none.

28:54.379 --> 28:57.576
I think I'm gonna have to
revise the filing system.

28:57.649 --> 29:01.608
Put you in
the "too good to be true" category.

29:01.686 --> 29:05.622
Mmm.
But not to worry.

29:05.690 --> 29:08.523
I just know you'll turn out
to be involved with somebody else...

29:08.593 --> 29:12.120
or... gay or crazy.

29:13.432 --> 29:16.333
[Sighs]

29:16.401 --> 29:19.370
Well, it's a definite possibility.

29:22.140 --> 29:24.074
Crazy, huh?

29:25.243 --> 29:27.177
Certifiable.

29:27.245 --> 29:29.179
- [Sighs]
- [TV, Indistinct]

29:31.049 --> 29:32.983
Mom.

29:34.419 --> 29:36.979
I know you've spoken to my doctor.

29:37.055 --> 29:40.183
I know. I know he told you
I don't have long...

29:40.258 --> 29:42.726
so let's not pretend
that I do, okay?

29:44.863 --> 29:46.797
Want to watch another movie?

29:46.865 --> 29:49.425
No. God, no.

29:51.403 --> 29:54.861
I tell you what I would like,
is I'd like to play a game.

29:54.940 --> 30:00.071
- Should I get a deck of cards?
- No. Not that kind of game.

30:00.145 --> 30:03.979
- What?
- I want each of us to take some time...

30:04.049 --> 30:08.247
and think of something that we have
always wanted to tell the other.

30:09.321 --> 30:12.017
Something private, some secret...

30:12.090 --> 30:14.490
some feeling or memory.

30:14.559 --> 30:18.120
It could be anything.
Just as long as it's truthful.

30:18.196 --> 30:21.495
Uh, I don't know
if I'd be good at that kind of game.

30:21.566 --> 30:23.466
Will you try for me?

30:27.139 --> 30:29.937
[Sighs]

30:30.008 --> 30:31.942
Um--

30:43.155 --> 30:45.487
I'm waiting.

30:48.126 --> 30:50.594
I never loved your father.

30:50.662 --> 30:52.596
Not for a minute.

30:53.965 --> 30:57.264
Wow. You're good at this.

31:01.173 --> 31:04.267
- Why did you marry him?
- Oh.

31:04.342 --> 31:06.367
I was pushing 30.

31:06.444 --> 31:10.312
Back then we called that
a last chance for happiness.

31:10.382 --> 31:13.874
He had a good business.
I remember my mother saying, "Marry him.

31:13.952 --> 31:16.045
He's an undertaker
and will never be out of work.

31:16.121 --> 31:18.021
People will always--"

31:20.025 --> 31:21.959
People will always die.

31:25.697 --> 31:27.631
People will always die.

31:35.874 --> 31:38.934
I hope it's okay for me
to say this, but...

31:39.010 --> 31:42.377
you strike me
as someone who's been...

31:42.447 --> 31:44.847
burned romantically.

31:46.484 --> 31:48.611
Scalded.

31:48.687 --> 31:51.383
Repeatedly.

31:51.456 --> 31:54.687
- Married?
- [Sighs]

31:54.759 --> 31:58.024
- Divorced?
- Yes.

31:58.096 --> 32:00.223
But that was a long time ago...

32:00.298 --> 32:02.562
and, believe it or not,
one of my better experiences.

32:02.634 --> 32:04.568
[Chuckles]
Let me guess.

32:04.636 --> 32:07.799
Uh, he was either involved
with somebody else...

32:07.872 --> 32:09.999
or gay...

32:10.075 --> 32:12.009
or crazy.

32:12.077 --> 32:14.011
Actually, yes.

32:15.747 --> 32:18.409
Involved with someone else?

32:18.483 --> 32:22.214
- Crazy?
- No. He was gay.

32:22.287 --> 32:24.551
- Wow. Really?
- Yeah.

32:24.623 --> 32:27.353
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- No.

32:27.425 --> 32:29.620
- I mean, I'm not sorry. I mean, uh--
- [Laughs]

32:31.029 --> 32:34.021
- Save me.
- It's okay.

32:34.099 --> 32:36.659
He was a great guy.

32:36.735 --> 32:40.694
I married the boy next door.
Literally. We were 19.

32:40.772 --> 32:43.741
It didn't last very long.
Couldn't, of course.

32:45.443 --> 32:49.174
I haven't seen him in a long time,
but, uh, but we're still friends.

32:49.247 --> 32:53.547
Which is more than I can say for the
parade of total losers that followed.

32:53.618 --> 32:58.214
Are there any, uh,
recent or current losers?

32:58.290 --> 33:00.281
No.

33:00.358 --> 33:04.385
I've been in a holding pattern
where romance is concerned.

33:04.462 --> 33:07.989
- Well, things can change quickly.
- Yeah.

33:12.570 --> 33:15.664
I'm sorry.

33:15.740 --> 33:19.801
This is, uh, going
a little too quickly for me.

33:21.746 --> 33:23.680
I can go slow.

33:24.849 --> 33:26.783
Look, Trent,
you're a nice guy. l--

33:26.851 --> 33:30.947
- Aw! Aw. That's-- You know?
- What?

33:31.022 --> 33:33.456
- I'm swimming ashore.
You can call the Coast Guard.
- Oh, come on.

33:33.525 --> 33:35.925
"Nice guy"? That's--

33:35.994 --> 33:40.363
I haven't been dismissed
with that since high school.

33:40.432 --> 33:42.923
Does that mean no second date?

33:43.001 --> 33:45.333
I have a hard time trusting men.

33:45.403 --> 33:49.237
I'm not men.
I'm not a group. Just me.

33:50.475 --> 33:52.875
Who probably has
a lot of women after him.

33:52.944 --> 33:56.141
- So?
- So--

33:56.214 --> 33:58.808
Look, you know,
you seem to want honesty...

33:58.883 --> 34:00.817
so I'll be honest with you.

34:00.885 --> 34:03.046
I don't really have
a problem getting dates.

34:03.121 --> 34:06.648
But I'm 38 years old.
I don't just want dates anymore.

34:06.725 --> 34:09.193
I'll tell you what I don't want.

34:09.260 --> 34:12.627
I don't want all of
this calculated artificiality.

34:12.697 --> 34:17.793
This isn't me, Trent--
this dress, the stupid little bows
in my hair. And look at you.

34:17.869 --> 34:21.862
I mean, I don't imagine you sit around
your house in an Armani suit. Do you?

34:21.940 --> 34:25.341
No. My house is black-tie.

34:25.409 --> 34:27.344
[Giggles]

34:31.815 --> 34:34.341
- Look, I'm sorry, but--
- I know, you have to go.

34:34.418 --> 34:37.786
- I'm already-- Jesus-- two hours late.
- You're leavin' me too.

34:37.856 --> 34:40.654
It's okay. Really.
Just go. Go.

34:40.725 --> 34:44.889
- Until the day I die,
I'll remember that story.
- Yeah, listen. Listen.

34:44.963 --> 34:49.059
You have been swell,
listening to me like this.

34:49.134 --> 34:53.661
Bet you'll think twice about striking up
a conversation in this bar again, huh?

34:53.737 --> 34:56.103
[Chuckles]
Take care. All right?

34:56.174 --> 34:58.642
- For once I really, really mean that.
- Yeah.

34:58.710 --> 35:01.076
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

35:06.885 --> 35:08.819
Taxi money.

35:08.887 --> 35:11.355
Don't even think of allowing
that guy to drive.

35:11.423 --> 35:14.119
I'm a lawyer.
I'll hunt you down.

35:20.665 --> 35:22.963
Look, Trent...

35:23.034 --> 35:26.333
if by some miracle,
after this explosion of neuroses...

35:26.404 --> 35:28.804
you still want to see me,
we can start from the top.

35:28.873 --> 35:31.307
You can cook dinner
for me Tuesday.

35:32.544 --> 35:34.978
- Okay.
- Good.

35:36.181 --> 35:38.615
- Tuesday.
- Yeah.

35:38.683 --> 35:41.846
- You can come to my apartment.
- Okay.

35:41.920 --> 35:45.083
Meet my better half.

35:45.156 --> 35:49.559
- Better half?
- Yeah. My dog. Barley.

35:49.627 --> 35:52.357
Your dog Barley? That'd be great.
I'd love to meet Barley.

35:52.430 --> 35:54.364
- Good.
- I'll bring the wine.

35:54.432 --> 35:56.559
- Great.
- Good.

35:56.634 --> 35:59.228
- Tuesday night.
- Absolutely.

35:59.304 --> 36:03.070
You know, Meredith,
those stupid little bows?

36:04.142 --> 36:06.076
I think they're adorable.

37:21.986 --> 37:23.920
[Sighs]

37:23.988 --> 37:26.957
Why did you stay with him?

37:27.025 --> 37:30.290
Well, you.

37:30.361 --> 37:34.525
I guess I was the last generation
of women who actually did that.

37:34.599 --> 37:38.365
It never even occurred to me
to get a divorce.

37:38.436 --> 37:42.463
[Sighs]
I was so relieved when he died.

37:42.540 --> 37:47.876
- Don't hold anything back, Mom.
- [Chuckles] Mmm.

37:47.946 --> 37:51.905
Ah, I like this
new spirit of frankness.

37:51.983 --> 37:54.543
It's oddly cleansing.

38:05.396 --> 38:08.058
I want to know
what you're like away from me here.

38:08.132 --> 38:12.296
That can't happen. The fact that you and
I aren't involved beyond this room...

38:12.370 --> 38:14.702
is what-- ahh-- appeals to me.

38:14.772 --> 38:18.765
You know how to play
your role damn well.

38:18.843 --> 38:21.539
[Laughs]
Guilty as charged.

38:24.449 --> 38:26.383
[Moans]

38:30.288 --> 38:34.554
- Roger, what do you want?
- I don't want much.

38:34.626 --> 38:37.754
I just want more of you.

38:39.797 --> 38:41.731
I can't give you that.

38:44.335 --> 38:47.964
Roger.
Don't be an anger ball.

38:48.039 --> 38:49.973
"An anger ball"?

38:51.576 --> 38:54.977
Don't you see?
What's great about you and me...

38:55.046 --> 38:59.881
right here, this very moment,
is that we don't come through
that door with a lot of baggage.

38:59.951 --> 39:03.717
We don't come through that door
with any baggage at all.

39:03.788 --> 39:07.747
And aren't we lucky?
We don't bring anything in...

39:07.825 --> 39:11.124
and we don't take anything out.

39:13.631 --> 39:16.862
% [Techno, Loud]

39:16.934 --> 39:26.707
%

39:26.778 --> 39:29.474
You're not the only one
who can dance alone.

39:29.547 --> 39:33.483
- What?
- I said you look like
a man in need of a Coke.

39:37.655 --> 39:40.351
%

39:40.425 --> 39:43.121
[Laughing]

39:43.194 --> 39:46.493
Uh, my friend here will have a Coke,
and I'll have a--

39:46.564 --> 39:50.261
Vodka martini,
very dry, three olives.

39:50.334 --> 39:52.268
Good memory.

39:52.336 --> 39:55.499
My mind has an endless capacity
for useless information.

39:58.009 --> 40:00.671
I've had a terrible day.

40:00.745 --> 40:04.112
I know we were talking about you for
a moment there, but my day was so bad.

40:04.182 --> 40:06.650
"How bad was it?" you might ask.

40:06.718 --> 40:09.744
-l might if you gave me the opportunity.
-l was saving you the effort...

40:09.821 --> 40:12.756
so that after I tell you my tale of woe
we can move on to happier topics.

40:12.824 --> 40:16.590
Perhaps one of your choosing. Anyway,
I'm an actress. Did I tell you that?

40:16.661 --> 40:21.030
- No. But I'm not surprised.
- I had this monologue in class today.

40:21.099 --> 40:24.762
And I was prepared.
You know, I mean, like really prepared.

40:24.836 --> 40:27.168
You know Suddenly Last Summer
by Tennessee Williams?

40:27.238 --> 40:30.867
- No.
- Oh, it's one of my favorites.
Great story.

40:30.942 --> 40:33.638
It's about this girl, Katherine-- moi--

40:33.711 --> 40:37.442
who is slated for a lobotomy
because the mother of her cousin
wants to keep her mouth shut...

40:37.515 --> 40:40.916
about certain goings-on involving
the old lady's son Sebastian.

40:40.985 --> 40:45.115
You see, the women sort of pimp
for Cousin Sebastian.
Are you following this?

40:45.189 --> 40:46.986
- Amazingly, yes.
- Anyway, it turns out...

40:47.058 --> 40:51.154
on their travels together Cousin
Sebastian liked to troll the beaches...

40:51.229 --> 40:55.689
looking for young native boys
in order to satisfy his base instincts.

40:55.767 --> 40:58.497
One hot afternoon in Cartagena...

40:58.569 --> 41:02.232
the boys decide they have had quite
enough of Sebastian's shenanigans...

41:02.306 --> 41:05.742
and they--
well, they eat him.

41:05.810 --> 41:09.337
- You mean metaphorically.
- No. They really eat him.

41:09.413 --> 41:14.077
They devour him.
In short, he's lunch.

41:14.152 --> 41:17.019
And Katherine witnesses
every course...

41:17.088 --> 41:19.420
from soup to nuts.

41:19.490 --> 41:21.720
If you'll pardon the expression.

41:21.793 --> 41:25.320
Anyway, I'm about to do
this killer monologue. I'm up next--

41:25.396 --> 41:28.957
If one more actor saunters
into this class...

41:29.033 --> 41:33.834
and recites Katherine's "native boys
ate my cousin Sebastian" speech...

41:33.905 --> 41:36.100
from Suddenly Last Summer...

41:36.174 --> 41:39.041
I am going to puke.

41:39.110 --> 41:42.477
Now, who is up next?

41:43.815 --> 41:47.808
- Um... Joan! You're on.
- [Moans]

41:49.287 --> 41:52.950
The teacher didn't lose
his lunch. I did.

41:54.025 --> 41:56.789
- I'm sorry.
- So am l.

41:59.664 --> 42:03.828
Now, on to happier topics, I promise.
How about a movie?

42:03.901 --> 42:05.732
- I told you.
- I know.

42:05.803 --> 42:08.636
I know. You don't date.
Is it a religious thing?

42:08.706 --> 42:12.767
- No.
- Well, you like movies, don't you?

42:12.844 --> 42:14.778
- They're okay.
- How about tomorrow night?

42:14.846 --> 42:17.644
It doesn't have to be a date.
We'll meet at the theater.

42:19.350 --> 42:22.979
- I don't know.
- Look. I'll make it easy.
Okay, blue boy?

42:23.054 --> 42:26.888
Tomorrow night I'm going to the
late show of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
at the Sunset Five.

42:26.958 --> 42:29.893
If you decide you would like to
join the human race, meet me there.

42:35.366 --> 42:39.700
Uh, now, in other news, they found
a cure for cancer. Okay. Uh, moving on.

42:39.770 --> 42:42.898
-No, they--
-[Hannah] Do you ever hear from Wendy?

42:42.974 --> 42:46.569
- [TV Volume Decreases]
- What on Earth made you think of Wendy?

42:46.644 --> 42:51.240
- Oh, I don't know.
Just thinking about the old days.
- Yes.

42:51.315 --> 42:53.715
Very old. Ancient.

42:55.353 --> 43:00.154
Well, do you?
Do you ever hear from her?

43:00.224 --> 43:02.158
Any reason I should?

43:02.226 --> 43:05.753
Any reason you should keep
her picture in your desk?

43:08.633 --> 43:12.865
- [TV Volume Increases]
- None that you should
concern yourself with.

43:12.937 --> 43:17.567
[Bill Maher]
Viagra. Oh, God.

43:17.642 --> 43:21.510
Viagra. That's what everyone's
talking about. Are you on it yet?

43:21.579 --> 43:23.740
Just the men.
Okay, uh, well...

43:23.814 --> 43:26.044
it's so successful,
you know, of course--

43:36.427 --> 43:38.361
- Hey. I made it.
- Hi.

43:38.429 --> 43:42.559
- Uh, casually attired.
- Wow.

43:42.633 --> 43:45.067
Yeah, I know. The flowers are
a little much, and I'm late.

43:45.136 --> 43:47.263
But only because I had second thoughts
about the flowers...

43:47.338 --> 43:50.364
and I threw them away halfway down the
block, and then I had third thoughts...

43:50.441 --> 43:52.466
and went back and got them.

43:52.543 --> 43:54.807
Well, I'm glad you did.

43:54.879 --> 43:57.177
Thank you.

43:57.248 --> 43:59.182
Come in.
Come in, come in, come in.

43:59.250 --> 44:03.380
- Thanks.
- l, uh-- I hope you like Italian.

44:03.454 --> 44:05.649
- I hope you like merlot.
- I do.

44:05.723 --> 44:07.748
- [Dog Panting]
- Wow! That's a--

44:07.825 --> 44:09.759
- Barley.
- That's some dog! That's, uh--

44:09.827 --> 44:13.058
- Barley, get down, sweetie.
Come on. Come on.
- Whoa.

44:13.130 --> 44:15.758
- My family has a thing for pets.
- Yeah. Oh.

44:15.833 --> 44:18.301
That's, uh--
That's certainly impressive.

44:18.369 --> 44:22.897
Suddenly I'm feeling
a little inadequate. That's--

44:23.975 --> 44:26.603
I, uh-- It's almost ready.
I, uh--

44:26.677 --> 44:31.341
Sorry that took me so long. I was
on the phone with one of my sisters.

44:32.650 --> 44:36.177
- The married one.
- The one who's having an affair?

44:36.253 --> 44:38.483
Yeah, well, the one
who's always having an affair.

44:38.556 --> 44:40.820
Her husband doesn't
suspect anything?

44:40.891 --> 44:44.520
Her husband is sweet,
but he's a bit dim.

44:46.063 --> 44:48.657
He doesn't have
much of an imagination.

44:48.733 --> 44:51.668
Chandler girls like their men
with imagination?

44:51.736 --> 44:54.034
Yeah. It helps.

44:55.373 --> 44:59.639
You know, I'm told
I have a good imagination.

45:01.645 --> 45:03.840
I don't want
to have sex tonight.

45:07.551 --> 45:10.884
- Okay.
- I mean if that's why you thought
I invited you over here--

45:10.955 --> 45:13.082
- I invited myself over here.
- Well, whatever.

45:13.157 --> 45:16.149
- I mean, I know that
must be kind of unusual.
- It's not unusual. l--

45:16.227 --> 45:18.161
I mean, I'm sure that most women
don't turn you down. [Muttering]

45:18.229 --> 45:20.629
Meredith, can we talk about
something else?

45:20.698 --> 45:23.326
Honestly, sex is the last thing
on my mind right now.

45:23.401 --> 45:25.631
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

is pissing me off.

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

45:56.267 --> 45:59.395
I can't understand why you haven't had
a relationship lately.

Really?
Well, that doesn't take long, does it?

46:06.177 --> 46:08.407
- What doesn't?
- I mean, you turn a guy down...

into an anger ball.

46:36.207 --> 46:39.699
yeah, if something happens between us,
sex will probably enter into it.

47:26.056 --> 47:29.025

It ends badly.

47:29.093 --> 47:33.257
That's a really depressing way
to look at a fledgling relationship.

Well, there's nothing
fledgling about it.

47:36.767 --> 47:39.668

the only viewpoint that I have.

with Wendy.

01:10:55.094 --> 01:10:57.528
Maybe this was your start.

01:10:57.597 --> 01:11:00.657
[Sighs, Whispers]
You're a fucking optimist.

01:11:00.733 --> 01:11:03.463
That's my job.

01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:18.977
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday, does it?

01:11:19.052 --> 01:11:22.988
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday.

01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:29.193
[Joan] So, let me take a stab
at Keenan's story.

01:11:30.396 --> 01:11:32.330
You had a great love.

01:11:32.398 --> 01:11:34.332
The romance of your lifetime.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.631
Totally cosmic, out-of-this-world bond
with little Miss X...

01:11:38.738 --> 01:11:40.672
and she left you.

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:43.334
You're not far off.

01:11:43.409 --> 01:11:45.536
People get over these things, Keenan.

01:11:45.612 --> 01:11:48.274
Hell, I'm getting over these things...
all the time.

01:11:48.348 --> 01:11:50.509
Well, it can only be once for me.

01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:53.450
You're sweet to believe things
so absolutely...

01:11:53.519 --> 01:11:56.010
but you're also full of shit.

01:11:57.156 --> 01:11:59.090
You can love again.

01:11:59.158 --> 01:12:03.094
I can't.
Any more than you--

01:12:03.162 --> 01:12:05.687
- Any more than I can what?
- I don't know.

01:12:05.765 --> 01:12:07.824
A-Any more than you
can stop drinking.

01:12:16.209 --> 01:12:18.200
- Can I get you another one?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

01:12:18.277 --> 01:12:21.508
- It was a gin martini, right?
- Vodka, but, really, I've had enough.

01:12:21.581 --> 01:12:24.311
- [Waiter] I insist, please.
- Look, pal--

01:12:24.384 --> 01:12:27.512
And I mean this affectionately,
all right? Scram.

01:12:29.222 --> 01:12:31.986
Where were we?
Oh, yes, I've just given up alcohol...

01:12:32.058 --> 01:12:34.526
and you're going to tell me
about the great love of your life.

01:12:34.594 --> 01:12:38.325
- Her name was Sarah.
- And she was your first?

01:12:38.398 --> 01:12:40.332
Yes.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.166
[Sighs] Look... it's natural
to elevate our first love...

01:12:44.237 --> 01:12:47.331
to some sort of
mythic emotional plateau.

01:12:47.407 --> 01:12:49.841
But you fell in love, she left you...

01:12:49.909 --> 01:12:52.173
and now you're dealing with
love's most common byproduct:

01:12:52.245 --> 01:12:54.213
suicidal manic depression.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.077
Right?

01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:59.346
- Do you feel better?
- No.

01:13:01.254 --> 01:13:04.519
It-- It's hard to talk about.

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.423
I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

01:13:07.493 --> 01:13:10.519
Really terrific.
I go and hear him jam every month or so.

01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:13.793
He plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

01:13:13.866 --> 01:13:17.597
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:21.970
And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:23.975
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

01:13:24.043 --> 01:13:27.809
how his playing made me feel,
how the music... made me feel.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.974
And he just kept shaking
his head and he said...

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:32.984
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

01:13:33.052 --> 01:13:36.317
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

01:13:37.223 --> 01:13:39.157
I said, "Well, okay, fine.

01:13:39.225 --> 01:13:41.887
Gonna get all philosophical on me.
It's as pointless as talking
about a lot of things.

01:13:41.961 --> 01:13:43.895
Love, for instance."

01:13:43.963 --> 01:13:46.488
And my friend laughed,
and he said...

01:13:46.566 --> 01:13:48.500
"Definitely. Most definitely.

01:13:48.568 --> 01:13:51.765
Talking about love is like
dancing about architecture."

01:13:51.838 --> 01:13:54.170
So, I don't know.
He might be right.

01:13:55.575 --> 01:13:58.738
But it ain't gonna
stop me from trying.

01:13:58.811 --> 01:14:00.870
[Laughs]

01:14:00.947 --> 01:14:04.883
I wish you'd do that
more often: smile.

01:14:04.951 --> 01:14:07.511
So do l.

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:14.117
So let me guess. You and Wonder Woman
were together a year?

01:14:14.193 --> 01:14:16.787
A year and a half.

01:14:16.863 --> 01:14:18.888
And you were faithful to her?

01:14:18.965 --> 01:14:21.229
Completely.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.030
And you shared everything.

01:14:30.176 --> 01:14:34.010
We-- We shared everything.

01:14:35.381 --> 01:14:37.474
That must be nice.

01:14:38.885 --> 01:14:41.479
It was...

01:14:41.554 --> 01:14:43.488
but...

01:14:45.391 --> 01:14:50.158
in addition to sharing
all of those things...

01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:54.325
it turns out I was also sharing her...

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.028
with a variety of other people.

01:14:58.404 --> 01:15:00.338
I hate to say this...

01:15:00.406 --> 01:15:02.966
because l-l don't want
to diminish your feelings...

01:15:03.042 --> 01:15:06.671
but, sadly, that happens every day.

01:15:06.746 --> 01:15:09.271
Those other people shared needles.

01:15:15.087 --> 01:15:17.112
% [Jazz Trumpet]

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:20.785
[Sighs] She died last year.

01:15:23.362 --> 01:15:27.458
But not before sharing...

01:15:27.533 --> 01:15:31.094
one final thing with me.

01:16:19.352 --> 01:16:22.412
Can I buy you a drink, Valery?

01:16:22.488 --> 01:16:25.218
- You seem to be so good at this.
- [Scoffs]

01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:28.454
Oh, I'm fine in scene class,
on stage.

01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:32.463
It's just this improvisational--
I can't do it.

01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:34.465
- Hmm.
- At least not like this.

01:16:35.868 --> 01:16:38.928
Maybe I'm just better
at pretending I'm someone else.

01:16:40.873 --> 01:16:44.809
Well, I gotta go. Um... I'll see you
in class tomorrow for the reports.

01:16:44.877 --> 01:16:47.471
God knows what I'll say.

01:16:47.546 --> 01:16:51.141
- I won't be there.
- Why?

01:16:51.217 --> 01:16:55.278
I, uh-- I like this too much.

01:16:55.354 --> 01:16:59.484
- I'm too good at it.
- I don't understand.

01:16:59.558 --> 01:17:02.994
I'm better at all these lies
that I've manufactured...

01:17:03.062 --> 01:17:05.656
than I am at the lies I'm living.

01:17:09.068 --> 01:17:11.696
I have a wife.
Did you know that?

01:17:14.307 --> 01:17:16.605
I don't think that
we like each other very much.

01:17:18.711 --> 01:17:21.236
Is that something
to smile about?

01:17:23.683 --> 01:17:26.777
Well, it's just that my wife--
She, um...

01:17:26.852 --> 01:17:29.844
doesn't think that I have
much of an imagination.

01:17:29.922 --> 01:17:32.152
If she only knew.

01:17:33.693 --> 01:17:36.457
If she only knew a lot of things.

01:17:36.529 --> 01:17:39.259
If I only knew a lot of things.

01:17:39.332 --> 01:17:41.266
Such as?

01:17:43.202 --> 01:17:45.136
Where to start:

01:17:45.204 --> 01:17:48.469
with myself...

01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:51.704
with my wife.

01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:07.482
They got it back.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.290
They got what back?

01:18:10.363 --> 01:18:12.297
The police. Your car.

01:18:12.365 --> 01:18:15.766
Oh, right. Yeah.

01:18:15.835 --> 01:18:17.769
Keenan, listen, I'm--

01:18:17.837 --> 01:18:21.102
You don't have to say anything. l-l told
you because I wanted to tell you.

01:18:23.342 --> 01:18:26.937
I wanted to because for
the first time in a long time
I wish things were different.

01:18:27.013 --> 01:18:29.709
- They can be.
- No, they can't.

01:18:37.857 --> 01:18:40.052
Well, none of this means
you can't love.

01:18:40.126 --> 01:18:43.459
Joan, it means exactly that.
It doesn't mean anything else.

01:18:43.529 --> 01:18:45.997
I don't believe that for a second,
that you can't love.

01:18:46.065 --> 01:18:48.124
- I can't.
- Stop saying that.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.136
It's the only thing I can say
to make you understand.

01:18:53.739 --> 01:18:57.800
This may sound corny, but--

01:18:57.877 --> 01:19:01.313
But you don't want me.

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:03.348
I-I'm damaged goods.

01:19:03.416 --> 01:19:08.479
For Christ's sake,
we're all damaged goods.

I'm doing half the time...

but I know that I can love.

01:19:17.396 --> 01:19:19.660
I know that I can love you.
I know that I do love you.

01:19:19.732 --> 01:19:22.929
- I won't let you love me.
- Why?

01:19:25.571 --> 01:19:28.665
[Voice Cracking]
I won't let you love me because...

01:19:33.245 --> 01:19:35.679
because I love you.

- Can I go?
- No!

[Car Doors Lock]

Do you know how long I have waited
for somebody I care about...

01:19:46.425 --> 01:19:48.825
to say that they love me
and for me to actually believe them?

01:19:48.894 --> 01:19:51.021
And if you think you're getting out
of this car, you're insane!

01:19:51.097 --> 01:19:53.190
It will never work.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.534
It's already working.

01:19:56.602 --> 01:19:59.696
It's working.
[Crying]

01:20:05.945 --> 01:20:08.345
I thought--
I thought you didn't cry.

01:20:08.414 --> 01:20:10.541
I thought you didn't date.

01:20:10.616 --> 01:20:14.484
Surprise, I'm crying...

01:20:14.553 --> 01:20:16.646
and this is very much a date.

01:20:16.722 --> 01:20:21.159
It's unconventional, perhaps,
but it's the best date I've ever had.

01:20:30.069 --> 01:20:33.004
I can't!

You're home early tonight.

You as well.

How is your improv class?

It finished tonight.

01:21:25.457 --> 01:21:28.324
I thought you had
another couple days.

01:21:28.394 --> 01:21:34.196
Well, I should say that
I finished tonight.

01:21:34.266 --> 01:21:36.427
It wasn't what you had in mind?

01:21:36.502 --> 01:21:38.436
Ultimately, no.

01:21:38.504 --> 01:21:43.999
Well... I'm sure you'll find
something you enjoy.

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.514
I mean, to keep you occupied.

01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:53.510

You know what Saturday is, don't you?

01:22:11.203 --> 01:22:13.137
I do.

01:22:13.205 --> 01:22:15.639
Okay.

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:18.142

Whatever's easier.

01:22:20.879 --> 01:22:24.645

You gave them their pills?

Okay. Well, don't forget to turn out
the light before you come to bed.

we can do, except ease the pain.

when you were still
inside my belly...

01:23:52.137 --> 01:23:55.834
and the contractions began?

- What story?

and the rocking chair.

- Good Night, Moon?
- Yeah.

Good night, noises...

while we spend all this time
anthropomorphizing our animals...

01:26:17.349 --> 01:26:19.783
maybe they're just
anthropomorphizing us?

- [Blanche Purring]
- Hmm.

01:26:21.954 --> 01:26:25.446
I didn't think so.
Who? Keenan?

01:26:25.524 --> 01:26:29.290
No. Trust me,
I'll never hear from him again.

01:26:29.361 --> 01:26:33.957
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm fresh out of jokes.

01:26:34.032 --> 01:26:37.468
What, is that a rhetorical question?
Why is my life so complicated?

01:26:37.536 --> 01:26:41.302
Gee, I don't know.
Why is your life so fucking simple?

01:26:41.373 --> 01:26:43.967
- [Knocking]
- Hold on. There's someone at the door.

01:26:44.042 --> 01:26:46.704
Well, I don't know until I answer it,
do l? Yeah, I'll ask who it is.

01:26:46.778 --> 01:26:48.712
Hold on.
Yeah.

01:26:52.985 --> 01:26:54.646
Hi.

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.813
Hi.

01:26:56.889 --> 01:27:00.222
Um, I'm just on the phone.
I'm gonna wrap it up, okay?

01:27:12.471 --> 01:27:14.735
They're geniuses at tricking you
into conversation.

01:27:14.806 --> 01:27:17.536
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:27:17.609 --> 01:27:19.440
I love conversations that
start with the guy saying...

01:27:19.511 --> 01:27:21.376
"l can't stop thinking about you."

01:27:21.446 --> 01:27:24.074
Mind you, I've never actually
been on the receiving end
of any of those conversations.

01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:26.083
Just looking at you
makes me happy.

01:27:26.151 --> 01:27:28.278
I have--
I have to sit down.

01:27:31.256 --> 01:27:35.625
When we're together,
whether or not I show it...

01:27:35.694 --> 01:27:40.188
[Groans] I just can't wait to hear
the next words out of your mouth.

01:27:40.265 --> 01:27:44.395
But right now I need to ask you
to do something for me.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:46.403
Anything.

01:27:46.471 --> 01:27:50.134
Shut up.
Just for a moment.

01:27:50.208 --> 01:27:52.938
I've been-- I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

01:27:54.546 --> 01:27:58.312
I have no idea
why you're so relentless...

01:27:58.383 --> 01:28:00.977
particularly, given the arsenal
of defenses I've thrown at you.

01:28:01.053 --> 01:28:02.987
But...

01:28:04.723 --> 01:28:10.628
no matter how hard I've tried to block
out everything that you've said...

01:28:10.696 --> 01:28:12.721
the message has been received.

01:28:16.168 --> 01:28:19.433
In a place inside me
that I thought had died.

01:28:20.505 --> 01:28:23.235
But it hasn't.

01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:28.776
And that place inside me
is alive and well.

01:28:32.351 --> 01:28:34.444
I can't make any promises...

01:28:34.519 --> 01:28:36.953
but...

01:28:37.022 --> 01:28:39.786
I'd like to try and be with you.

01:28:42.427 --> 01:28:46.454
It won't be easy,
but I'd like to try.

01:28:46.531 --> 01:28:48.761
Can I say something?

01:28:56.942 --> 01:29:00.639
You're right.
It won't be easy, but...

01:29:00.712 --> 01:29:03.647
[Laughing]

01:29:03.715 --> 01:29:05.910
that's okay.

01:29:07.386 --> 01:29:11.550
I want to be with you, but,
you have to understand, l, um--

01:29:11.623 --> 01:29:13.648
- We can't--
- Have sex.

01:29:13.725 --> 01:29:17.161
It may not be the conventional wisdom,
but it's the only way I can do this.

01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:19.356
At least for the time being.

01:29:20.732 --> 01:29:22.700
That's not a problem?

01:29:22.768 --> 01:29:28.331
When was having sex
or not having sex not a problem?

01:29:28.407 --> 01:29:33.174
To be honest, it's gonna
be difficult not to express
physically what I feel for you...

01:29:33.245 --> 01:29:37.648
but...
we can look for other ways.

01:29:37.716 --> 01:29:42.813
There's nothing wrong
with holding each other. Hmm?

01:29:42.888 --> 01:29:45.379
Nothing at all.

01:29:45.457 --> 01:29:47.391
And sleeping with each other.

01:29:47.459 --> 01:29:49.393
We can do that.

01:29:49.461 --> 01:29:52.225
And... loving each other forever.

01:29:53.765 --> 01:29:56.859
- What did I ever do to deserve you?
- [Laughs]

01:29:56.935 --> 01:30:01.201
Usually that line is screamed at me
by somebody running out the door...

01:30:01.273 --> 01:30:05.039
not standing in front
of me and staying.

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:07.874
It makes for a nice change.

How thoughtful.

01:30:33.905 --> 01:30:36.999
Whoo. We like the same merlot.

01:30:37.075 --> 01:30:40.010
It's actually the very same bottle
that you brought to my house.

01:30:40.078 --> 01:30:42.569
[Laughs] Excellent.

01:30:42.647 --> 01:30:44.672
Come on in.

01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:46.684
Wow.

01:30:51.923 --> 01:30:55.518
- You're wondering where dinner is.
- Uh, I must say.

01:30:55.594 --> 01:30:57.858
I have a little confession to make.

01:30:57.929 --> 01:31:01.194
I invited you to dinner at my house,
but I can't cook.

01:31:01.266 --> 01:31:03.359
- Oh.
- [Doorbell Rings]

01:31:03.435 --> 01:31:05.369
- [Laughs]
- I can order delivery.

01:31:05.437 --> 01:31:07.530
All right.

01:31:07.606 --> 01:31:09.870
Chinese food is my specialty.

01:31:19.551 --> 01:31:21.985
What are we making?

01:31:22.053 --> 01:31:24.146
Some hemlock.

01:31:24.222 --> 01:31:26.747
Oh, please, don't deprive
the kids of their mother.

01:31:26.825 --> 01:31:31.159
- Oh, I'm not making it for me.
- Ah, that's the Hannah that I know.

01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:35.097
Well, you seem to know me
a lot better than I know you.

01:31:35.167 --> 01:31:37.499
You know that's not true.

01:31:37.569 --> 01:31:42.871
Do you remember what you told
the kids about falling in love?

01:31:44.242 --> 01:31:46.676
- No.
- Well, I do.

01:31:46.745 --> 01:31:50.181
You said that the wonderful thing
about falling in love...

01:31:50.248 --> 01:31:56.016
is that you learn everything
about that person, and so quickly.

01:31:56.087 --> 01:31:58.021
And if it's true love...

01:31:58.089 --> 01:32:01.525
then you start to see yourself
through their eyes...

01:32:01.593 --> 01:32:03.527
and it brings out
the best in you...

01:32:03.595 --> 01:32:08.032
and it's almost as if you're
falling in love with yourself.

01:32:08.099 --> 01:32:11.364
- I said that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:11.436 --> 01:32:15.736
Well, 25 years ago,
I needed to feel that again.

01:32:15.807 --> 01:32:19.140
Feel that I was worth loving.

01:32:19.211 --> 01:32:21.645
Because somehow I knew...

01:32:21.713 --> 01:32:26.047
that would be my last time
to have that particular feeling.

01:32:27.886 --> 01:32:31.481
- You couldn't have it with me?
- Oh, I did have it with you...

01:32:31.556 --> 01:32:33.649
but I'd forgotten it.

01:32:33.725 --> 01:32:36.489
I hadn't forgotten
why I loved you...

01:32:36.561 --> 01:32:39.394
but I'd forgotten
why you loved me.

01:32:41.399 --> 01:32:43.333
[Laughs]

01:32:43.401 --> 01:32:46.165
And Wendy made me remember...

01:32:46.238 --> 01:32:49.833
that I was a pretty terrific fellow.

01:32:49.908 --> 01:32:52.342
Bully for Wendy.

01:32:52.410 --> 01:32:56.346
But I knew that
I couldn't sleep with her.

01:32:56.414 --> 01:32:58.041
Why?

01:32:58.116 --> 01:33:02.280
Because I would have left you...
and the kids.

01:33:12.931 --> 01:33:15.798
What are we thinking?

01:33:15.867 --> 01:33:18.461

01:33:18.536 --> 01:33:20.800
Oh.

01:33:20.872 --> 01:33:25.969
Remember the day
Wendy left the company...

01:33:26.044 --> 01:33:28.979
- and went to Seattle?
- Yes.

01:33:29.047 --> 01:33:31.140
I thought for a while
you might go with her.

01:33:31.216 --> 01:33:34.151
Me too, but I didn't.

01:33:37.889 --> 01:33:40.483
When I came home that day...

01:33:40.558 --> 01:33:44.654
I realized that I was
more in love with you...

01:33:44.729 --> 01:33:46.993
than ever before.

01:33:48.733 --> 01:33:52.169
How did that thunderbolt strike you?

01:33:52.237 --> 01:33:55.331
Because I'd made a choice.

01:33:56.574 --> 01:34:00.010
I took one look at you...

01:34:00.078 --> 01:34:04.674
and I knew I'd made
the right choice.

01:34:04.749 --> 01:34:07.013
I know that sounds daft...

01:34:07.085 --> 01:34:10.851
but my love for somebody else...

01:34:10.922 --> 01:34:13.789
made me love you more...

01:34:13.858 --> 01:34:18.124
because I sought...

01:34:18.196 --> 01:34:20.130
to reclaim myself.

01:34:21.866 --> 01:34:24.130
And, Hannah...

01:34:24.202 --> 01:34:27.137
you're still the right choice.

01:34:30.208 --> 01:34:33.143
We made a child that day.

01:34:33.211 --> 01:34:35.145
We did, indeed.

01:52:22.443 --> 01:52:25.003
Other than maybe dropping a bookshelf
on their heads.

Ow!
[Laughing]

01:52:41.962 --> 01:52:46.990
Sorry. Now you know the real reason
why I like to dance alone.

01:52:47.067 --> 01:52:51.504
It's okay.
You can step on my feet anytime.

01:52:51.572 --> 01:52:55.133
Just, you know, next time I'll wear
some steel-toed shoes or something.

If only they knew
what we know.

01:53:25.105 --> 01:53:28.632
Then it would be all too easy.

- The trumpet player--
- Hmm?

01:53:31.478 --> 01:53:33.776
- Your friend?
- Yeah.

01:53:33.847 --> 01:53:37.305
The one who said talking about love
is like dancing about architecture.

01:53:37.384 --> 01:53:39.318
Mm-hmm.

01:53:40.554 --> 01:53:43.921
