WEBVTT

01:41.834 --> 01:43.698
We're looking for someone.

02:56.601 --> 02:59.090
<i>Some things may not be spoken of…</i>

02:59.967 --> 03:02.264
<i>things from the past,</i>

03:02.368 --> 03:03.959
<i>from long ago.</i>

03:05.101 --> 03:09.228
<i>But this does not mean
you can ever forget them.</i>

03:12.834 --> 03:17.359
<i>There are things
that can never be forgotten.</i>

06:20.234 --> 06:23.758
<i>How the stranger found us was a mystery.</i>

06:24.934 --> 06:27.730
<i>The idea of anyone
living so close to the skies</i>

06:28.268 --> 06:31.633
<i>was a mere legend
in the villages down below.</i>

06:31.734 --> 06:34.758
<i>And that was just fine with our people.</i>

07:14.034 --> 07:15.296
Who are you?

07:15.934 --> 07:17.629
Greider.

07:18.134 --> 07:19.760
What do you want up here?

07:20.468 --> 07:22.162
Lodgings.

07:22.268 --> 07:24.667
You'd better get lost.

07:28.134 --> 07:29.794
Didn't you hear?

07:54.601 --> 07:56.760
How long did you say you wanted to stay?

07:57.601 --> 07:59.067
For the winter.

08:05.168 --> 08:06.896
One bag won't be enough.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.068
What do you want here, anyway?

08:22.301 --> 08:24.858
<i>When the stranger told them
what he wanted,</i>

08:24.967 --> 08:27.457
<i>none of Brenner's sons said a word.</i>

08:28.800 --> 08:31.199
<i>No one had expected anything like that.</i>

08:54.734 --> 08:57.600
<i>Even Old Brenner was speechless at first.</i>

09:00.067 --> 09:04.057
<i>Because what the stranger
had with him was a mirror.</i>

09:04.168 --> 09:06.260
<i>A mirror with a memory.</i>

09:07.001 --> 09:09.559
<i>That's what Old Brenner called it.</i>

09:50.568 --> 09:53.057
<i>Then they brought the stranger to us.</i>

10:09.568 --> 10:12.660
- For the winter?
- We'll see.

10:13.501 --> 10:14.899
Where's your daughter?

10:15.635 --> 10:16.999
She's inside.

10:17.734 --> 10:21.168
Call her down
so she can meet him.

10:24.635 --> 10:26.033
Luzi!

10:26.568 --> 10:27.193
What?

10:27.301 --> 10:30.393
Come and say hello to your guest.

10:50.468 --> 10:51.594
This is Luzi.

10:52.134 --> 10:54.999
And this is your lodger.
Greider's his name.

10:55.934 --> 10:57.663
Take good care of him.

10:58.334 --> 11:00.426
But not too good.

11:01.101 --> 11:02.727
See you.

11:43.501 --> 11:45.127
You can make it yourself.

11:45.234 --> 11:46.292
Luzi!

12:00.468 --> 12:01.991
It's okay.

12:02.734 --> 12:05.327
- No, I'll do it.
- Please.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.063
If you want to eat, come now.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.693
So you make pictures?

13:13.867 --> 13:15.425
With a box?

13:17.368 --> 13:19.800
What do you want pictures of?

13:19.901 --> 13:21.528
Of our valley?

13:23.700 --> 13:24.826
I see.

13:25.700 --> 13:29.395
- And you're really from America?
- Yes.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.227
Are there really Indians there?

13:34.501 --> 13:35.967
Yes.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.795
Have you ever seen one?

13:40.601 --> 13:41.659
Really?

13:42.268 --> 13:43.667
Yes.

13:44.568 --> 13:46.330
How come you speak German?

13:47.401 --> 13:49.459
My mother taught me.

13:49.568 --> 13:52.728
- How did she know our language?
- Luzi, enough.

13:53.234 --> 13:55.326
Don't ask so many questions.

14:06.434 --> 14:09.196
The men, who are they?

14:11.867 --> 14:13.459
The sons…

14:14.934 --> 14:16.492
of Old Brenner.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.866
All six of them?

14:31.134 --> 14:32.998
Brenner calls the shots up here.

14:34.568 --> 14:36.330
But he also takes care of us.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.997
Lukas, you fool. You scared me.

16:33.901 --> 16:36.562
Lukas, we shouldn't.

16:37.468 --> 16:38.764
Luzi, please.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.698
Not until we're married.

16:58.934 --> 16:59.933
Lukas.

17:02.601 --> 17:04.760
I don't even want to think of it.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.233
But I can't help it.

17:10.434 --> 17:11.798
All the time.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.096
I want to work.

18:24.034 --> 18:25.126
Help out.

18:30.301 --> 18:32.461
I won't let you.

18:34.767 --> 18:37.667
- You're our guest.
- He could chop wood.

18:38.234 --> 18:41.497
I mean, if he knows how to.

18:41.601 --> 18:42.659
Not everyone can.

18:46.301 --> 18:49.132
The pictures you take—
What kind are they?

18:49.234 --> 18:50.894
Can I see them?

18:51.700 --> 18:53.292
Yes, of course.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.290
- Where is this?
- Texas.

18:58.101 --> 18:59.659
Is that you?

19:00.867 --> 19:02.391
And your mother?

19:05.601 --> 19:07.363
What about your father?

19:07.468 --> 19:09.628
Do you have a picture of him?

19:09.734 --> 19:10.996
No.

19:11.101 --> 19:12.500
He died long ago.

19:12.601 --> 19:14.500
My father is dead, too.

19:16.101 --> 19:19.432
The mountain took him. My brother, too.

19:22.134 --> 19:23.601
During a storm.

19:44.234 --> 19:45.723
You're not doing too bad there.

19:48.034 --> 19:50.433
Pile them up round the side.

19:52.368 --> 19:54.301
I'm going to the village.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.890
Want to come along?

20:38.301 --> 20:39.699
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.926
What do you need?

20:41.535 --> 20:45.968
A bag of flour, a bag of oats,
lard, and some white twine.

20:46.468 --> 20:48.025
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:49.034 --> 20:50.728
And some sugar, too.

20:51.434 --> 20:53.060
- How much?
- Two pounds.

20:53.601 --> 20:55.158
And you? What do you need?

20:56.501 --> 20:57.627
Coffee.

20:58.901 --> 21:00.630
It'll take a moment.

21:06.434 --> 21:08.264
And horseshoe nails.

21:12.601 --> 21:13.999
We have a blacksmith…

21:14.700 --> 21:17.463
if you need your horse shoed.

21:21.234 --> 21:24.133
Aren't the women taking care of you?

21:41.001 --> 21:42.797
Hans told you…

21:43.601 --> 21:45.465
to take good care of your guest.

21:47.468 --> 21:49.025
And what Hans wants…

21:49.934 --> 21:51.333
he gets.

21:51.967 --> 21:53.127
Right?

22:02.334 --> 22:04.096
Everything's fine.

22:08.934 --> 22:10.492
Did anyone ask you?

22:13.700 --> 22:17.600
I'll have a schnapps.
And one for him, too.

22:36.635 --> 22:38.124
I don't drink.

22:52.368 --> 22:54.062
All he does is watch.

23:13.034 --> 23:15.263
If I buy you a schnapps,

23:15.368 --> 23:16.891
then you drink it.

23:19.401 --> 23:20.459
Stop.

23:21.368 --> 23:22.766
Leave him alone.

23:27.134 --> 23:28.601
Now look at that.

23:31.301 --> 23:33.530
Now you're taking care of your guest.

23:37.501 --> 23:38.728
Put it on my tab.

23:46.034 --> 23:48.297
They're long here, the winters.

24:23.901 --> 24:25.425
This is no place for you.

24:27.001 --> 24:29.298
When the snow falls, it'll be too late.

24:30.434 --> 24:32.298
You can still leave.

25:06.834 --> 25:09.097
<i>The next few days, he roamed the valley,</i>

25:09.767 --> 25:11.098
<i>that Mr. Greider.</i>

25:11.635 --> 25:13.033
<i>With his box.</i>

25:15.401 --> 25:18.856
<i>But he never talked about
what happened at the inn.</i>

26:43.934 --> 26:46.424
If you're hungry, just let me know.

26:47.834 --> 26:49.028
Thanks.

26:52.368 --> 26:53.857
When is the wedding?

26:55.301 --> 26:58.166
Soon. Before the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception.

27:01.434 --> 27:03.162
Can I ask you something?

27:07.301 --> 27:10.325
Can I have a picture?
Of Lukas and me?

27:12.134 --> 27:13.192
Yes.

27:13.834 --> 27:16.199
But it has to be before the wedding.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.097
<i>Greider kept his promise.</i>

27:44.568 --> 27:46.898
<i>It was when the first snow came,</i>

27:47.001 --> 27:51.025
<i>before it got dark in our valley.</i>

29:11.334 --> 29:13.198
There'll be more snow.

29:22.601 --> 29:24.124
Timber!

29:47.501 --> 29:50.797
<i>When snow started to fall,
they brought down the wood.</i>

29:50.901 --> 29:52.334
<i>It's easier that way.</i>

29:53.501 --> 29:55.161
<i>But it's dangerous work.</i>

29:55.268 --> 29:57.531
<i>All the men in the village pitch in.</i>

29:58.134 --> 29:59.192
Timber!

29:59.301 --> 30:01.131
<i>Even Brenner's sons helped, too.</i>

30:01.234 --> 30:02.757
Timber!

30:22.934 --> 30:24.401
Stop!

30:25.901 --> 30:27.731
Stop!

30:45.434 --> 30:47.424
Timber!

30:47.901 --> 30:49.334
Timber!

31:15.901 --> 31:17.095
I'll go.

31:18.368 --> 31:20.164
Stop!

33:04.067 --> 33:05.761
The death knell.

35:14.734 --> 35:16.792
Take him home.

36:28.368 --> 36:30.267
There's a picture, too.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.258
Luzi is getting it.

37:05.501 --> 37:08.797
I already went to see the priest
for the banns.

37:09.501 --> 37:11.559
He says the wedding is on, nonetheless.

37:12.934 --> 37:14.992
He's already talked to Old Brenner.

37:59.501 --> 38:01.024
What if we go away?

38:02.734 --> 38:03.996
Forever.

38:07.101 --> 38:08.897
What about our folks?

38:11.934 --> 38:14.026
But I want you to be the one.

38:16.434 --> 38:18.128
Don't you think I do, too?

38:19.101 --> 38:20.795
You know I love you.

38:24.134 --> 38:25.567
Then do something.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.766
<i>The next day Rudolf Brenner went hunting…</i>

40:05.834 --> 40:08.597
<i>as he did every year after the first snow,</i>

40:09.134 --> 40:12.397
<i>when hunger forces the game
down into the valley.</i>

41:03.700 --> 41:05.463
Show yourself!

42:56.734 --> 43:00.190
<i>In the village there was talk
that Old Brenner was worried</i>

43:00.635 --> 43:04.591
<i>because Rudolf
had never stayed away so long before.</i>

43:06.268 --> 43:10.599
<i>After three days the Brenner sons
set off to look for him.</i>

43:29.401 --> 43:31.425
Pack me some food.

44:21.168 --> 44:24.260
Only the Brenners
are allowed to carry guns here.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.392
Didn't you know?

44:29.501 --> 44:31.593
Did you bring it from America?

44:34.635 --> 44:36.101
What do you need it for?

44:36.201 --> 44:38.464
They'll come looking for me.

48:28.800 --> 48:30.097
Where is he?

48:30.767 --> 48:32.325
I don't know.

49:03.700 --> 49:06.224
<i>It snowed all night long.</i>

49:07.734 --> 49:10.167
<i>And the snow covered all the traces.</i>

49:10.967 --> 49:13.900
<i>But they knew
he couldn't escape the valley.</i>

49:15.434 --> 49:20.026
<i>In spite of all this, Old Brenner
insisted that the wedding went ahead.</i>

53:20.034 --> 53:22.160
You must always remember

53:22.767 --> 53:26.667
our Lord and Father
every hour of every day.

53:27.301 --> 53:29.097
Do not forget this.

53:30.268 --> 53:35.531
But today let us talk about a father
who wasn't almighty.

53:37.434 --> 53:39.900
Let us remember

53:40.334 --> 53:42.857
the good man, Joseph.

53:44.901 --> 53:47.766
What do you think he felt

53:48.468 --> 53:50.934
when his wife was with child

53:51.034 --> 53:53.399
though he had never lain with her?

53:55.168 --> 53:57.328
He must have been full of rage…

53:58.468 --> 54:00.458
and felt helpless.

54:03.568 --> 54:05.592
If he had chased Mary away,

54:06.134 --> 54:08.192
everyone would have understood.

54:08.901 --> 54:11.266
But he was pious…

54:12.301 --> 54:15.097
and didn't want to bring shame on her.

54:18.301 --> 54:21.598
And so he acquiesced,

54:22.301 --> 54:24.632
knowing that his son

54:25.168 --> 54:27.226
came from a higher being.

54:27.334 --> 54:29.426
Joseph understood

54:29.934 --> 54:33.697
that the Lord
had not imposed a sacrifice upon him,

54:34.568 --> 54:36.864
but had sent him a gift from heaven.

54:37.501 --> 54:40.127
And what did the Holy Mary say about this?

54:42.434 --> 54:45.401
"Even if he uses me

54:45.767 --> 54:48.064
and my womb…

54:49.834 --> 54:52.097
I shall not protest,

54:52.967 --> 54:58.299
for he is one
who knows better than I

54:59.034 --> 55:03.661
what is good and what is right."

55:07.301 --> 55:08.666
Amen.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.524
I want to confess.

56:48.134 --> 56:49.533
Confess?

56:51.934 --> 56:53.265
Now?

57:42.368 --> 57:44.096
In the name of the Father,

57:44.201 --> 57:47.362
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

57:48.168 --> 57:49.260
Amen.

57:50.067 --> 57:52.432
May God,
who has enlightened every heart,

57:52.535 --> 57:55.229
help you to know your sins
and trust in his mercy.

57:55.767 --> 57:56.893
Amen.

58:00.234 --> 58:02.996
I have sinned
against the fifth commandment.

58:07.101 --> 58:08.591
I have killed.

58:12.734 --> 58:14.258
One in the woods,

58:15.901 --> 58:17.334
one man while hunting.

58:26.501 --> 58:27.831
Who are you?

58:44.700 --> 58:46.758
You knew my mother.

59:03.601 --> 59:08.057
<i>What happened back then,
more than 20 years ago,</i>

59:08.568 --> 59:10.660
<i>is still talked about.</i>

59:11.268 --> 59:15.963
<i>One lad took a stand
and wouldn't hand over his bride.</i>

59:16.268 --> 59:18.962
<i>He didn't want Brenner to lie with her…</i>

59:20.800 --> 59:22.858
<i>not only on the wedding night,</i>

59:23.434 --> 59:25.866
<i>but until she fell pregnant…</i>

59:27.401 --> 59:29.561
<i>as he had done
with every woman in the valley.</i>

59:43.934 --> 59:47.129
<i>Her folk were famished
when they arrived in the valley…</i>

59:48.401 --> 59:50.765
<i>like everyone else who came here.</i>

59:52.734 --> 59:55.224
<i>Our people wanted to send them away,</i>

59:56.101 --> 59:58.727
<i>but first they had to ask Old Brenner.</i>

1:00:01.734 --> 1:00:04.361
<i>Brenner needed fresh blood…</i>

1:00:05.401 --> 1:00:07.425
<i>and he liked what he saw.</i>

1:00:08.967 --> 1:00:13.333
<i>That day Brenner told her parents
how things worked up here</i>

1:00:13.434 --> 1:00:15.458
<i>when it came to young women…</i>

1:00:16.568 --> 1:00:19.728
<i>and that he decided
who could stay and who should go.</i>

1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:27.325
<i>They begged and wept,
but their hunger was stronger.</i>

1:00:29.601 --> 1:00:32.261
<i>So they made a promise
to Old Brenner…</i>

1:00:33.434 --> 1:00:34.923
<i>and stayed.</i>

1:00:37.867 --> 1:00:42.665
<i>Then the day came when Brenner
asked them to make good on their promise.</i>

1:00:56.967 --> 1:01:01.526
<i>She couldn't believe it
when she heard a knock at the window.</i>

1:01:01.635 --> 1:01:04.329
<i>Her lover had come to rescue her.</i>

1:01:12.700 --> 1:01:16.861
<i>They thought the innkeepers
would hide them if they paid.</i>

1:01:18.067 --> 1:01:20.898
<i>But Brenner paid more.</i>

1:01:21.368 --> 1:01:24.028
<i>She was greedy, the innkeeper's wife…</i>

1:01:24.734 --> 1:01:26.361
<i>and a coward, too.</i>

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:31.029
<i>Then they punished the couple…</i>

1:01:32.067 --> 1:01:37.524
<i>so everyone would know what happens
when a woman fails to fulfill her duty.</i>

1:01:48.268 --> 1:01:50.757
<i>But then the Lord had mercy after all,</i>

1:01:52.168 --> 1:01:55.602
<i>though some say
the devil was caught off-guard.</i>

1:02:10.368 --> 1:02:12.665
<i>No one saw the woman ever again.</i>

1:02:12.767 --> 1:02:15.360
<i>She escaped the valley. Forever.</i>

1:02:18.501 --> 1:02:21.400
<i>Brenner punished others for it:</i>

1:02:23.234 --> 1:02:25.133
<i>the bride's parents.</i>

1:02:29.134 --> 1:02:30.725
<i>He wanted them gone.</i>

1:02:37.368 --> 1:02:40.960
<i>And they left the bridegroom
hanging there…</i>

1:02:42.101 --> 1:02:43.931
<i>till nothing was left of him.</i>

1:02:47.401 --> 1:02:48.697
Her!

1:04:08.568 --> 1:04:10.057
Music!

1:04:17.501 --> 1:04:19.024
Go on.

1:04:54.067 --> 1:04:55.261
Dance.

1:04:58.368 --> 1:04:59.460
Dance!

1:05:07.468 --> 1:05:09.401
Or I'll dance with her.

1:06:00.834 --> 1:06:02.028
Now me.

1:06:28.967 --> 1:06:31.400
- Now me.
- I'm not done yet.

1:06:35.568 --> 1:06:36.966
I'm not done yet.

1:06:38.067 --> 1:06:39.432
Stop it!

1:06:43.034 --> 1:06:44.033
No!

1:06:44.767 --> 1:06:46.496
Please stop!

1:06:48.501 --> 1:06:49.627
Please!

1:06:49.734 --> 1:06:51.928
Stop it! Stop!

1:06:53.635 --> 1:06:56.602
What? What do you want?

1:07:12.501 --> 1:07:14.331
Let's go. It's time, anyway.

1:07:29.767 --> 1:07:31.394
Lukas, don't.

1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:37.065
It's no use.

1:07:52.834 --> 1:07:54.426
Move.

1:10:16.901 --> 1:10:17.900
The woman.

1:10:25.134 --> 1:10:27.294
Luzi, take his rifle.

1:10:45.401 --> 1:10:47.664
And you all, throw yours away.

1:11:09.601 --> 1:11:11.295
Off your horses, all of you.

1:11:11.901 --> 1:11:13.061
You, too.

1:11:26.668 --> 1:11:28.430
Unhitch the horse.

1:11:34.001 --> 1:11:36.298
Luzi, mount the horse.

1:11:57.468 --> 1:11:59.196
Let the horses go.

1:12:08.934 --> 1:12:10.128
Luzi, go on.

1:12:11.434 --> 1:12:13.832
Go on, go!

1:12:32.700 --> 1:12:33.962
You're…

1:12:35.234 --> 1:12:36.667
dead.

1:12:37.101 --> 1:12:38.159
I swear.

1:12:40.601 --> 1:12:43.329
At your farm. Tomorrow.

1:12:44.767 --> 1:12:46.132
After sunrise.

1:13:16.834 --> 1:13:18.563
The gun.

1:13:26.700 --> 1:13:28.724
Why did you do it?

1:13:29.234 --> 1:13:30.599
Why?

1:13:35.101 --> 1:13:36.568
Come on.

1:13:54.767 --> 1:13:56.893
They'll look here first.

1:16:09.368 --> 1:16:11.267
I want him alive.

1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:23.393
- Why didn't you let Luzi go?
- Mother.

1:16:26.468 --> 1:16:29.458
- My God.
- They'll come for us.

1:16:29.934 --> 1:16:31.026
No.

1:16:31.568 --> 1:16:33.364
I'm going to them.

1:16:40.934 --> 1:16:42.231
Thank you.

1:17:39.468 --> 1:17:42.196
Woman! Come here.

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:46.699
Come on!

1:18:15.901 --> 1:18:17.630
What do you want from us?

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:20.133
Money?

1:18:20.834 --> 1:18:23.301
I don't want your money.

1:18:24.134 --> 1:18:26.124
I've got some for you.

1:18:33.201 --> 1:18:35.532
You like to talk…

1:18:37.101 --> 1:18:38.897
for money.

1:18:41.168 --> 1:18:42.533
Pick it up.

1:18:44.101 --> 1:18:45.727
Pick it up.

1:19:02.668 --> 1:19:04.157
Eat it.

1:19:09.434 --> 1:19:11.264
Eat it, I said!

1:19:21.901 --> 1:19:23.061
Come on.

1:19:26.767 --> 1:19:28.132
Come on!

1:19:35.201 --> 1:19:37.031
Don't! Please stop!

1:19:37.568 --> 1:19:39.057
My God—

1:19:58.700 --> 1:20:00.758
- Eat it!
- Please!

1:20:00.867 --> 1:20:03.732
Eat! Eat it!

1:20:20.934 --> 1:20:22.265
Please.

1:26:10.800 --> 1:26:11.960
Run!

1:26:49.234 --> 1:26:50.825
Help me!

1:26:53.234 --> 1:26:55.565
Help me!

1:27:00.967 --> 1:27:03.798
Help me! Please!

1:27:05.034 --> 1:27:07.297
Help me!

1:27:09.568 --> 1:27:12.091
Help me, you cowards!

1:27:13.668 --> 1:27:15.157
Hans!

1:27:51.034 --> 1:27:52.592
Stop it already!

1:27:53.368 --> 1:27:54.800
You bastard!

1:27:55.434 --> 1:27:57.196
You swine!

1:29:15.568 --> 1:29:17.398
Pull yourself together!

1:29:23.334 --> 1:29:25.267
He's only got two shots.

1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:26.960
Two shots at a time.

1:29:27.568 --> 1:29:29.660
We've got four.

1:37:25.268 --> 1:37:26.565
You stay here.

1:39:48.468 --> 1:39:52.696
She was a beautiful woman…

1:39:56.268 --> 1:39:57.791
your mother.

1:40:27.635 --> 1:40:29.033
Come here.

1:41:01.734 --> 1:41:07.032
So you are her son.

1:42:05.734 --> 1:42:06.996
And?

1:42:10.134 --> 1:42:12.067
My sons?

1:42:17.401 --> 1:42:18.400
Dead.

1:42:21.401 --> 1:42:22.765
All of them.

1:42:31.468 --> 1:42:32.798
Your…

1:42:35.268 --> 1:42:36.700
brothers.

1:42:42.635 --> 1:42:46.568
I beg you, make it quick.

1:47:34.601 --> 1:47:36.261
<i>He almost died…</i>

1:47:37.168 --> 1:47:38.499
<i>of fever.</i>

1:47:41.034 --> 1:47:42.830
<i>He was ill for three weeks.</i>

1:47:48.234 --> 1:47:49.700
<i>Nobody said a thing,</i>

1:47:51.168 --> 1:47:54.999
<i>though there were many
who wanted to chase him away.</i>

1:47:56.434 --> 1:47:58.663
<i>Or do worse.</i>

1:47:59.635 --> 1:48:02.692
<i>Old Brenner had sown his seed
in every family.</i>

1:48:08.301 --> 1:48:13.893
<i>And freedom is a gift
that not everyone likes to receive.</i>

1:48:21.834 --> 1:48:24.063
<i>That year, spring came earlier than usual.</i>

1:48:26.134 --> 1:48:27.465
<i>It was in March,</i>

1:48:28.034 --> 1:48:30.899
<i>just before noon,
when Greider headed off.</i>

1:48:38.134 --> 1:48:39.601
<i>He looked back one last time.</i>

1:48:41.468 --> 1:48:43.764
<i>That was the last time I saw him.</i>

1:48:47.301 --> 1:48:51.200
<i>That day I told Lukas
that I was with child.</i>

1:48:51.301 --> 1:48:54.427
<i>He was pleased and proud,</i>

1:48:54.967 --> 1:48:57.400
<i>because at last
something good had happened.</i>
