WEBVTT

00:01.359 --> 00:04.091
- Previously on Being Human.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.963
- I want you to turn me
into what you are.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.640
- No, you don't know
what you're asking.

00:09.670 --> 00:11.308
- Aaah!

00:11.340 --> 00:14.037
- Sally?
- Your brother will be safe.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.050
You will no longer kill the
people that you used to know

00:17.080 --> 00:18.775
by having contact
with them.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.246
But when you die,
your soul is mine.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.780
(Screaming)

00:24.820 --> 00:26.857
- We've been hunting
down vampires.

00:26.890 --> 00:27.960
- Aidan is a good man.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.685
- He needs to
be stopped.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.119
The wolf bond goes deeper.

00:32.159 --> 00:35.095
That makes you
my secret weapon.

00:35.130 --> 00:37.121
- (Erin):
He's home early.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.990
- Don't take your eyes off him.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.597
(Coughing)

00:43.610 --> 00:45.169
I'm almost there.

00:46.710 --> 00:50.442
- Oh! It was your blood.
You did this.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.278
- Stay back!

00:52.320 --> 00:53.674
(Retching)

00:54.650 --> 00:57.540
Hey! What part of "I'm the one
with the pointy stick”

00:57.590 --> 00:58.910
don't you understand?

01:00.590 --> 01:03.059
(Groaning)

01:10.200 --> 01:11.998
- Josh. Dammit.

01:15.670 --> 01:17.331
- Wait. Stop.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.532
- Die, you leech!

01:19.580 --> 01:20.979
Oh!

01:22.110 --> 01:23.475
(Gasping)

01:23.510 --> 01:24.705
- All right, who's ready

01:24.750 --> 01:26.411
for an early-morning
sugar coma?

01:29.120 --> 01:30.383
Aidan.

01:32.820 --> 01:35.255
Erin?

01:35.290 --> 01:36.485
Erin.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.952
Oh my God.

01:37.990 --> 01:40.652
Erin, I need you
to open your eyes.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.395
Erin?

01:42.430 --> 01:44.262
Erin.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.134
(Groaning)

02:01.520 --> 02:03.443
(EKG monitor beeping)

02:03.490 --> 02:06.016
- (Woman on PA):
Mark Stanford to radiology.

02:06.050 --> 02:08.451
Mark Stanford to radiology.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.025
- How is she?

02:18.830 --> 02:20.764
- She's not good.

02:23.940 --> 02:27.205
In and out of consciousness
since they admitted her.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.948
Neuro has faith that
she'll improve, but until then,

02:29.980 --> 02:32.449
there's no telling what
the swelling's gonna do

02:32.480 --> 02:34.369
to her brain functions.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.774
(Sighing)

02:35.820 --> 02:39.916
In the meantime, I'm running
interference with the lab...

02:41.320 --> 02:45.951
trying to make sure that her
blood comes back human...

02:47.600 --> 02:48.999
and that the
doctors think

02:49.030 --> 02:51.624
that she just took an
exceptionally bad fall.

02:52.470 --> 02:55.861
So this is the part
where you tell me...

02:57.040 --> 02:58.508
what really happened.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.474
I mean, what?
Did you feed from her?

03:00.510 --> 03:01.477
What happened?
- No!

03:01.510 --> 03:02.477
- Well, then what--

03:02.510 --> 03:03.807
- Not intentionally.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.444
Listen, I came home,
I had a couple of vials,

03:06.480 --> 03:08.915
and the next thing
I know, I'm laid out

03:08.950 --> 03:11.442
and I hadn't
felt that way since...

03:11.490 --> 03:12.810
well, since you.

03:14.090 --> 03:16.582
There was werewolf
blood in my supply.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.950
Had to be.

03:17.990 --> 03:18.957
- It had--

03:18.990 --> 03:20.196
It's impossible. How?

03:20.230 --> 03:21.720
- Well, I don't
know, Josh.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.922
I mean, currently
we're sharing an address

03:23.970 --> 03:25.790
with not one
but 2 werewolves.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.229
There's your girlfriend,

03:27.270 --> 03:29.432
but then there's this
wild teenage delinquent

03:29.470 --> 03:32.508
who I found out likes
to carry around wooden stakes.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.030
- What?

03:34.080 --> 03:36.606
- She came at me, Josh.

03:37.610 --> 03:39.749
- That-- No!

03:39.780 --> 03:41.043
(Stammering)

03:41.080 --> 03:42.787
She has nothing
against you.

03:42.820 --> 03:44.413
She likes you
more than me!

03:44.450 --> 03:45.781
<i>- I know.</i>

03:45.820 --> 03:46.981
- She likes you enough

03:47.020 --> 03:48.419
- to make me
irrationally jealous!

03:48.460 --> 03:51.088
- I know, and yet I found
myself lying on the floor

03:51.130 --> 03:53.053
with blood pouring
out of my eyeballs.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.090
- Where is she?

03:54.130 --> 03:55.791
- She's in 59.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.468
- She's a kid, Aidan!
- Whoa!

03:57.500 --> 04:00.595
- Who Josh and I have taken
responsibility for!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.460
- I was defending myself--

04:02.510 --> 04:03.602
- You're telling me that

04:03.640 --> 04:05.699
your only recourse
against a teenage girl

04:05.740 --> 04:07.504
was slamming her
head into a wall?

04:07.540 --> 04:08.610
- Shhh!

04:08.640 --> 04:10.472
- Let him tell his
side of the story.

04:10.510 --> 04:13.514
- No. They are excuses,
Josh, and he always has them.

04:13.550 --> 04:17.088
The truth is that wherever
you go, violence follows.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.918
Well, I know something
about violence too.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.850
And if Erin doesn't
make it through this,

04:22.890 --> 04:25.552
then you will have
to answer to me.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.994
- Nora?

04:34.700 --> 04:36.907
(Telephone ringing)

04:45.750 --> 04:47.240
- Bridge?

04:47.280 --> 04:49.647
I was hoping you
still worked here.

04:50.650 --> 04:51.913
It's really me, Bridge.

04:51.950 --> 04:54.885
Just don't freak out.
I can explain.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.560
- It worked.
- Don't freak out.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.900
- I've made contact
with the other side.

04:59.930 --> 05:02.228
How can I help
you, spirit?

05:02.260 --> 05:03.796
Let me be your vessel.

05:03.830 --> 05:06.629
- OK, so I don't really know
what you're talking about.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.230
OK? But, um, I thought
we could get some crab dip

05:09.270 --> 05:10.965
and some Chardonnay
or something.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.604
(Man singing on stereo,
indistinct)

05:13.640 --> 05:14.971
- Oh!

05:16.750 --> 05:18.377
Oh my God!

05:18.410 --> 05:22.517
- OK. Now that you've confirmed
the existence of my face...

05:22.550 --> 05:24.518
- You're not a ghost.
- No!

05:24.550 --> 05:27.110
- You're alive?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.083
- And I'm serious
about that crab dip.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.758
I am starving
all the time.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.724
- (Laughing):
Oh my God!

05:32.760 --> 05:33.955
- You're...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.297
(Chuckles)

05:35.330 --> 05:37.594
You're taking this
extraordinarily well.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.961
- Oh!

05:39.770 --> 05:42.330
(Car honking)

05:42.370 --> 05:43.929
(EKG monitor beeping)

05:43.970 --> 05:46.803
- (Woman on PA): Joseph
DiBartolo, extension 3317.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.807
- Hey.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.932
(Sighing)

05:48.980 --> 05:50.379
- You need to
call your sister.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.412
We were supposed to
have lunch today.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.418
- Yeah, OK.
It's no problem. I'll...

05:54.450 --> 05:57.943
- And maybe go home, get some of
her things in case she wakes up,

05:57.990 --> 06:00.516
maybe some pyjamas,
her toothbrush.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.812
- Nora.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.955
We're doing exactly what
we should be doing right now.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.458
We're just being
with her, OK?

06:06.500 --> 06:09.526
This is... It's the best
thing we can do.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.493
(Sighing)

06:14.240 --> 06:17.665
- I know that
Aidan's our friend.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.678
I do.

06:19.710 --> 06:23.578
And part of me honestly does
believe that he wants to be,

06:23.610 --> 06:25.146
I don't know...

06:26.210 --> 06:27.848
a better vampire.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.111
If there is
such a thing.

06:31.150 --> 06:34.950
But there's just so
much collateral damage.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.129
(Telephone ringing)

06:38.660 --> 06:41.550
- Aidan thinks it
was werewolf blood

06:42.730 --> 06:44.664
that caused the reaction.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.738
It was Erin's blood
in his supply.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.602
- She's been a werewolf
for a minute and a half.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.630
- I know, I know.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.875
- Even if she knew

06:53.910 --> 06:55.878
what effect her blood
could have on a vampire

06:55.910 --> 06:57.105
why would she hurt Aidan?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.403
- I don't know.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.518
I mean, the track
record's there.

07:02.550 --> 07:05.110
I mean, she has
a history of violence.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.811
- Yeah, and so does Aidan.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.428
But his caps out at
a little over 200 years.

07:16.160 --> 07:20.097
- You know, when Erin ran away,

07:21.070 --> 07:24.131
Liam was the
one who found her.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.569
(Sighing)

07:25.610 --> 07:27.669
He was the one
who brought her home.

07:27.710 --> 07:31.874
And he hasn't exactly
hidden the fact

07:31.910 --> 07:36.211
that he wants Aidan--
that he wants all vampires dead.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.451
- Why can't you just...

07:40.490 --> 07:43.585
for once admit that he might've
done something wrong.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.826
- I get it. I understand
what you're saying.

07:45.860 --> 07:48.727
I just don't think that
he meant to hurt her.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.922
I really don't.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.166
- I sometimes wonder...

07:56.170 --> 07:58.639
if it really came down to it...

08:00.740 --> 08:04.142
which one of us
would you choose, Josh?

08:08.150 --> 08:10.016
- Hey, buddy.

08:10.050 --> 08:12.189
What you got going on?

08:15.990 --> 08:17.856
Excuse me, who are you?

08:18.860 --> 08:20.225
- Aidan, it's fine.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.591
She's OK.
It's not a big deal.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.860
- I'm gonna need to see
some credentials.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.700
Hey. Did you hear me?
Your hospital credentials.

08:28.740 --> 08:29.935
Now.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.735
- Allow me to extend
a lunch invitation.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.614
I'm Blake.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.210
Our friend's finally
met his maker.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.092
- How did you find him?

08:56.130 --> 08:57.461
- I followed you.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.060
Well, you and any of
the others left standing,

09:00.100 --> 09:03.263
but Aidan Waite does have
a certain reputation.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.166
And now that Kenneth and
I are better acquainted--

09:06.210 --> 09:07.280
- It's Kenny.

09:07.310 --> 09:08.835
- Well, actually,

09:08.880 --> 09:10.507
Kenneth is fine.

09:12.210 --> 09:15.111
- Anyway, I think it's all
an act of fate, don't you?

09:15.150 --> 09:16.845
- Uh, come again?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.585
- Vampires taking
without consent

09:18.620 --> 09:20.782
is why we find ourselves
facing extinction.

09:20.820 --> 09:25.781
Whereas Kenneth wants, needs
the gift of eternal life.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.253
And I'm thrilled
to give it to him.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.723
- OK, hold on.
The gift of eternal-- OK.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.397
Kenny? No.

09:32.430 --> 09:34.535
Absolutely not.
This is not happening.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.197
You understand?
Hey! Buddy!

09:36.240 --> 09:38.106
- He said the two
of you were close.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.210
- We are.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.378
- I thought
you'd approve.

09:40.410 --> 09:43.050
- _It's a fair and
civilized arrangement.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.343
- Really?

09:44.380 --> 09:45.779
- He sustains me till he's 18.

09:45.810 --> 09:48.313
- Kenny?
- Then I give him his fangs.

09:48.350 --> 09:50.341
- OK, absolutely not.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.210
No, I didn't want this.
Not for you.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.753
=I can't live
like this anymore.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.650
You know that, because
I told you, remember?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.968
We made a deal.
It's done.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.425
- Yeah, but she didn't tell
you the cost of that de--

10:10.040 --> 10:12.839
- Your Aunt Blake is gonna
have to step out, Kenny.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.473
I need to get
a culture.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.375
- See you later,
Aunt Blake.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.515
- You too, Nurse Waite.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.058
- If you compelled him...

10:30.090 --> 10:33.799
- Why on earth would I need
to compel a 17-year-old boy?

10:33.830 --> 10:37.460
I'm the first scrubs-free
woman he's seen in years.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.195
You heard him.

10:39.230 --> 10:40.334
He wants this.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.168
- Who made you?
What city?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.463
(Sighs)

10:43.510 --> 10:45.160
- You're asking
about my pedigree?

10:45.210 --> 10:46.735
- What are you,
like, 5?

10:46.780 --> 10:47.702
- Eleven.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.071
- Uh-huh, young enough

10:49.110 --> 10:51.408
to think that this
condition, it's special

10:51.450 --> 10:52.770
and that you're
saving people

10:52.820 --> 10:54.948
and that this is
some form of evolution.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.711
- And you're old enough
to be this jaded?

10:57.750 --> 11:00.549
Why, when you come
from greatness?

11:00.590 --> 11:02.558
You're Bishop's son,

11:02.590 --> 11:05.685
a legend of war with
a seat at Mother's side.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.825
- Yes, and a small island nation
considers me to be their god.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.464
Do you people
hear yourselves?

11:10.500 --> 11:13.060
- And you're a
purebred-wolf killer.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.180
Look, I understand we don't
share the same worldview,

11:23.210 --> 11:26.009
but I've always heard
you were a forward thinker.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.417
The deal with Kenneth
is give and take.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.646
It's a benefit
to both species.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.409
Can't you see
that is evolution?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.923
<i>* I don't know</i>

11:42.970 --> 11:44.324
- Thank you!

11:44.370 --> 11:46.998
* If we will meet again... *

11:47.040 --> 11:50.761
- So now you're like
some sort of zombie or...

11:50.810 --> 11:54.599
- Why does that word
have to be so damn trendy?

11:54.640 --> 11:58.349
No, zombies can only,
like, stalk and moan,

11:58.380 --> 12:01.418
whereas I can
accessorize.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.311
Bridge, OK.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.285
Now that I can see people
again, like, face to face,

12:08.320 --> 12:09.287
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.879
- I had to find you,

12:10.930 --> 12:12.898
because when I was a ghost,

12:12.930 --> 12:15.399
you and I, we had some
kind of connection, right?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.762
- I'll never
forgive myself

12:17.800 --> 12:19.791
for not listening
to you about Danny.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.899
It's just my mind
wasn't open enough.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.908
- That's not true.
You heard me.

12:23.940 --> 12:26.637
You heard me when
no other human could.

12:26.670 --> 12:29.310
- No, I failed you.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.876
- No! Bridge.

12:30.910 --> 12:34.073
- But what I'm trying to say
is that, that experience,

12:34.120 --> 12:36.270
that connection
to the other side...

12:36.320 --> 12:38.880
I've joined
a Wicca group.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.828
- You're serious?

12:43.730 --> 12:46.085
Huh! So that's why
the hair and the...

12:46.130 --> 12:50.294
I mean, no, it's--it's just,
like, it's a lot of look.

12:50.330 --> 12:54.699
- You are doubting the existence
of an afterlife for the soul,

12:54.740 --> 12:56.697
a person who actually
had an afterlife?

12:56.740 --> 12:58.731
- No, but, um,
I just know people

12:58.770 --> 13:00.909
who can communicate
with the dead,

13:00.940 --> 13:03.671
and it just doesn't
really work like that.

13:03.710 --> 13:06.077
- Every Wiccan must
arrive at the practice

13:06.110 --> 13:07.817
that suits her
individually.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.739
- Hmm!
- When I'm in the circle,

13:09.780 --> 13:12.010
calmness comes over me
and my mind empties.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.256
- Yeah.

13:13.290 --> 13:16.214
- What I really wanted
was to find you, Sally.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.300
But who knows how many other
spirits might need my help?

13:20.330 --> 13:22.094
Oh! Come with me!

13:22.130 --> 13:25.065
- Mmm... Ooh!
Uh, no, 'cause I just--

13:25.100 --> 13:28.866
Actually, I'm just
getting over a lot of, like,

13:28.900 --> 13:30.504
heavy, post-traumatic
witch stuff.

13:30.540 --> 13:34.101
And I can't really deal with
people asking about who I am,

13:34.140 --> 13:35.437
so I'd rather just...

13:35.480 --> 13:36.436
- Please!

13:36.480 --> 13:37.447
- No. I--

13:37.480 --> 13:39.107
- I just got
you back.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.618
- No.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.119
- I want us to be part of
each other's lives again.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.847
- Yeah, that's the
only reason I came.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.354
But like...
- Sally.

13:48.390 --> 13:49.482
- Nah!

13:49.520 --> 13:51.625
- This group is
my new life.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.519
(Muttering)

13:56.500 --> 13:57.661
All right.

13:57.700 --> 13:58.963
(Laughing)

14:06.110 --> 14:08.101
(Knocking)

14:12.510 --> 14:14.012
(Sighing)

14:16.180 --> 14:18.046
(Siren in distance)

14:18.090 --> 14:19.649
(Birds chirping)

14:19.690 --> 14:20.953
- Is Nora here?

14:20.990 --> 14:22.788
She's not answering her phone.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.130
- Uh, hello, Kat.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.355
- Sorry.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.890
Hello again, Aidan,

14:29.930 --> 14:33.264
Nora's roommate who is
emphatically not a junkie.

14:34.470 --> 14:35.631
Do you know
where she is?

14:35.670 --> 14:37.559
- Um, not here. No.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.432
Her and Josh are at the
hospital. A friend got hurt.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.745
- Meaning I'm the jerk who
just left her 13 voicemails

14:43.780 --> 14:46.306
ranting about the shoddy
plumbing in her apartment

14:46.350 --> 14:48.773
while she's standing
vigil by someone's bed.

14:48.820 --> 14:49.844
I better go.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.439
- Oh, hold on,
plumbing?

14:51.490 --> 14:55.085
- Uh, yeah, the pipe burst
under the sink. I can fix it.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.623
I just don't know
where the water main is

14:57.660 --> 14:59.355
or the super's
contact info,

14:59.390 --> 15:00.926
so I should probably stop

15:00.960 --> 15:03.566
wasting valuable time
complaining to you and get back

15:03.600 --> 15:05.591
because the water
line is creeping up

15:05.630 --> 15:06.768
around everything I own.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.835
It's awesome!

15:07.870 --> 15:09.360
- Well, Kat,
wait, wait.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.765
Um...

15:10.810 --> 15:12.767
Maybe I can help you out.

15:13.610 --> 15:15.100
- Really?

15:15.140 --> 15:17.450
- Sure. Yeah,
I know plumbing.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.777
- Cool!

15:23.220 --> 15:25.348
(Sighing)

15:28.160 --> 15:29.855
- How is she?

15:29.890 --> 15:33.258
- Well, she's--she's stable,

15:33.300 --> 15:36.600
but it's very
serious head injury.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.166
Nora's with her.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.500
- Well, I'm grateful
you thought to call me.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.689
Please, lead the way.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.799
- You know, you
never actually

15:44.840 --> 15:46.433
told us how
you managed

15:46.470 --> 15:51.374
to get Erin back to
our house with you.

15:52.380 --> 15:55.042
I mean, not that you're
alarmingly gallant,

15:55.080 --> 15:57.845
but you're also
a complete stranger.

15:58.890 --> 16:03.327
And she's not super into
trusting other people.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.488
(Siren wailing)

16:05.530 --> 16:08.898
- I supposed though the shock
of the turn was considerable,

16:08.930 --> 16:11.763
she still thought it was
best to be with her own kind.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.337
Hmm? To be with Nora.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.630
- I thought you and
I understood each other.

16:18.670 --> 16:19.967
- Hmm?

16:20.010 --> 16:22.274
- That you knew that
I stand with Aidan.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.445
- I won't pretend
to approve

16:24.480 --> 16:27.040
of your less-than-discerning
taste in friends,

16:27.080 --> 16:30.118
but let's just say I've learned
to make my peace with it.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.482
- I'll never be
able to prove it,

16:32.520 --> 16:35.683
but I know that
you had something to do

16:35.720 --> 16:38.052
with Erin trying
to hurt Aidan.

16:38.090 --> 16:41.492
You told me to
protect my family.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.895
The only way
I know how to do that

16:44.930 --> 16:47.991
is to keep them
the hell away from you.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.737
Stay away from us.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.410
(Sighing)

17:06.190 --> 17:08.079
- Sis, I'm really sorry

17:08.119 --> 17:11.089
that we just completely forgot
you guys had plans today.

17:11.130 --> 17:15.749
This--this has just been
all-consuming and crazy.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.064
- I totally
understand.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.967
I'm not sure that Nora and
I have worked our way up

17:21.000 --> 17:22.991
to one-on-one
status anyway.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.161
- Why did you agree
to lunch then?

17:26.210 --> 17:29.077
- Because I know how
important it is to you.

17:30.310 --> 17:33.245
- Nora's great. I mean, you
think she's great, right?

17:33.280 --> 17:36.375
- I absolutely think
that she is great, yes.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.219
- Because, Em,
honestly, it's--it's--

17:39.250 --> 17:40.979
It's gotten
really serious.

17:41.020 --> 17:44.126
I love her and--and, uh,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.458
and I know how close
you were with Julia.

17:46.490 --> 17:49.926
And I just want you to have that
same bond with Nora before I--

17:49.960 --> 17:52.827
- Before you ask
her to marry you.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.235
Right? Right?

17:58.240 --> 17:59.833
Right.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.977
(Giggling)

18:02.010 --> 18:04.001
- How do you
do that?

18:04.050 --> 18:06.303
(Car honking)

18:08.320 --> 18:11.017
- Ah! It's fixed!
- Yes!

18:11.050 --> 18:12.415
- As long as
we define "fixed"

18:12.450 --> 18:14.418
as the absence
of a geyser

18:14.460 --> 18:17.589
and not an actual licensed
plumber state of affairs.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.429
- Oh, I'm sure that whatever
you did is gonna hold.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.361
- The upshot might be a leak
in the neighbour's unit...

18:23.400 --> 18:24.367
(Chuckling)

18:24.400 --> 18:27.062
...but thanks
for your help.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.239
- I really didn't
do anything.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.568
You have a toolbox
the size of a compact car.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.807
- Yeah, I take pride
in knowing things about things.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.205
- I used to be better at...

18:36.240 --> 18:39.369
But who can keep up
with technology, right?

18:39.410 --> 18:40.809
- It's aluminum.

18:41.650 --> 18:43.812
But you did, um,
turn off the water.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.443
- That I did!

18:45.490 --> 18:48.380
- And I don't even know how
you got into the basement.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.320
That door would
not budge for me.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.852
- Well, something to be
said for brute strength.

18:52.890 --> 18:55.325
- All right,
well, I, uh,

18:55.360 --> 18:58.159
you know, I should
probably get changed, so...

18:59.470 --> 19:00.733
(Chuckles)

19:00.770 --> 19:03.410
- Oh! Oh, I am so sorry.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.466
Absolutely. Uh, thank--
You're welcome.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.204
Oh, hey.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.049
Never would've pegged Nora
for a de Tocqueville fan.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.640
- She very well might be,
but those are mine.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.149
- Seriously? What are you,
a history buff?

19:18.190 --> 19:20.113
- I'm an adjunct
at Boston College.

19:20.150 --> 19:23.586
PhD candidate.
Early American.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.257
- What's your thesis?

19:25.290 --> 19:28.055
- The plot for
New England secession

19:28.100 --> 19:29.499
at the Hartford Convention.

19:29.530 --> 19:30.793
- That's so weird.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.491
- Thanks.
- That's not what I mean.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.669
No one writes about
the unrest in the militia

19:34.700 --> 19:36.930
when Madison took
the troops from the border

19:36.970 --> 19:38.404
and put them in Albany.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.636
- Only because
succession was never

19:40.680 --> 19:42.034
an imminent reality.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.243
- Well, yeah, but I mean, if the
convention had gone another way,

19:45.280 --> 19:47.578
the government couldn't
have stopped New England

19:47.620 --> 19:49.577
from splintering off
the military force.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.317
Half the men were on
the other side of the issue.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.757
- You know things
about things.

19:56.790 --> 19:59.452
- Yeah, I just knew
some of-- knew of--

19:59.490 --> 20:02.050
Know of some of
the players involved.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.522
- Hmm!

20:07.540 --> 20:08.939
(Sighing)

20:08.970 --> 20:11.507
I suddenly feel
very not dry.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.167
Hmm?

20:16.980 --> 20:19.540
- Uh, thanks for
the brute strength.

20:19.580 --> 20:20.843
- Yep!

20:20.880 --> 20:21.847
(Door closes)

20:21.880 --> 20:23.211
(Scoffing)

20:23.250 --> 20:25.241
- Hey, it's a
statistically proven fact

20:25.290 --> 20:27.952
that modern American society
has stripped its men

20:27.990 --> 20:29.458
of the benchmarks
of maturity,

20:29.490 --> 20:32.323
whereas women continue
to evolve and thrive.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.489
- Right, so your Women's
Studies textbook told you

20:35.530 --> 20:37.794
that I was wanting
to get engaged, right?

20:37.830 --> 20:38.797
(Chuckling)

20:38.830 --> 20:39.797
- Yeah.

20:39.830 --> 20:40.934
- Just saying.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.563
- You weren't
exactly subtle

20:42.600 --> 20:45.069
about wanting me
to bond with Nora.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.306
That's why...

20:49.040 --> 20:51.179
I brought you this.

20:59.150 --> 21:00.959
- It's Grandma's
engagement ring.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.310
How--

21:02.360 --> 21:03.828
- Julia gave it to me

21:03.860 --> 21:07.421
when she realized you
were never coming back.

21:09.660 --> 21:12.220
She just couldn't
face Mom and Dad.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.735
(Bird chirping)

21:21.280 --> 21:24.272
- It's bad luck,
isn't it?

21:24.310 --> 21:26.642
- Do we really
believe in that stuff?

21:26.680 --> 21:29.877
- I think it's a little
dense to enter into a marriage

21:29.920 --> 21:31.183
without fearing divorce.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.984
- Hmm.

21:33.020 --> 21:34.249
(Sighing)

21:34.290 --> 21:36.918
- And I know
I wasn't there

21:36.960 --> 21:39.827
when Mom and Dad
got separated

21:39.860 --> 21:41.999
and I know
it got ugly.

21:42.030 --> 21:42.997
(Bird chirping)

21:43.030 --> 21:44.327
But that's not enough

21:44.370 --> 21:47.829
to make me wanna give up
on a lifetime with Nora.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.170
- Julia would like
her, you know?

21:53.940 --> 21:56.102
If things
were different.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.441
- Yeah, I think so too.

22:03.150 --> 22:06.120
- They, um, wanted me
to take sides

22:06.150 --> 22:08.118
went it all fell apart.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.252
(Car honking)

22:09.290 --> 22:10.519
Mom and Dad.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.920
I went rogue.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.553
I chose yours.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.023
Because you're
my person,

22:20.070 --> 22:23.233
until I find
my person.

22:23.270 --> 22:26.535
And I'm really glad
you found yours.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.402
(Sighing)

22:37.280 --> 22:39.681
- Hey, champ, you awake?

22:41.020 --> 22:42.317
- Blake just left.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.850
Leave me alone.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.456
(Groaning)

22:57.410 --> 22:59.504
- Hey! I just came
from Kenny's room.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.202
How many vials of blood did
you take from him today?

23:02.240 --> 23:03.332
(Sighing)

23:03.380 --> 23:04.677
How many vials
did you take?

23:04.710 --> 23:06.872
- I've been starving!
We all have.

23:06.910 --> 23:08.378
You know that.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.479
- I have tolerated you because
that's what Kenny wants.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.215
I actually give
a damn about him.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.718
But if you don't...

23:15.590 --> 23:16.819
(Sighing)

23:16.860 --> 23:19.227
...pace yourself...

23:19.260 --> 23:21.024
OK, look.

23:21.060 --> 23:24.428
I haven't traditionally
had a lot patience

23:24.470 --> 23:27.394
with vampires
in my hospital.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.999
I know you're young.

23:29.040 --> 23:33.102
But you can't continue to be
stupid, especially not now.

23:33.140 --> 23:34.699
- Then help me.

23:34.740 --> 23:38.142
There are so
few of us left.

23:38.180 --> 23:39.773
I've had no one
to turn to,

23:39.810 --> 23:42.609
no one to help me believe
in some kind of a future

23:42.650 --> 23:45.881
where I won't be scrounging,
where I won't be scared.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.952
This virus can't
run rampant forever.,

23:49.990 --> 23:53.824
If we're smart,
we can outlast it.

23:53.860 --> 23:56.397
You and I are
survivors, Aidan.

23:56.430 --> 24:00.469
When this is over,
we could rebuild the race

24:00.500 --> 24:02.138
and do it
better this time.

24:02.170 --> 24:06.266
We could run Boston,
maybe even more than Boston.

24:08.610 --> 24:11.307
(Chuckles nervously)

24:23.760 --> 24:26.786
- I've already
run Boston.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.330
It wasn't all it was
cracked up to be.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.471
Kat?

24:43.510 --> 24:45.877
- Stalk much?

24:45.910 --> 24:48.675
- I'm s-- Come again?
Oh! This-- No.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.213
I get it. I'm actually
here to see Erin.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.412
It's Josh and
Nora's friend.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.610
Also I work here.
I'm a nurse.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.957
- You're not a nurse.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.355
A male nurse?

24:59.390 --> 25:01.449
A male nurse with
a detailed knowledge

25:01.500 --> 25:03.229
of early American
war history.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.365
(Both sighing)

25:05.400 --> 25:07.767
How many heads do
you have in your freezer?

25:09.040 --> 25:12.362
- It's just I'm
interested in people,

25:12.410 --> 25:14.572
um, helping people, so...

25:14.610 --> 25:18.148
- Well, my mom taught me
that the only way to help

25:18.180 --> 25:22.378
when a loved one is in the
hospital is with casserole.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.218
Well, casserole
and cookies.

25:24.250 --> 25:27.185
- Wow, that is very
thoughtful and very helpful.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.551
Let me help you
with that.

25:28.590 --> 25:29.785
- Thank you. Yeah.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.424
I mean, Nora's such
a good friend.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.326
She would do
the same for me.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.419
- Kat?

25:35.460 --> 25:36.530
Hey!
- Hi!

25:36.560 --> 25:38.028
- What are you
doing here?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.060
- Uh, sustenance.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.762
- Oh, thank you!
That's so nice of you.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.202
- Oh, I made that too.

25:45.240 --> 25:48.107
- Oh no, you didn't.
Give me a break! Wow!

25:48.140 --> 25:50.370
- That's right.
The two of you have met.

25:50.410 --> 25:53.539
- Oh, yeah. He saved my life
earlier over at the apartment.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.617
- I figured you
didn't need to deal

25:55.650 --> 25:58.119
with faulty plumbing
on top of everything else.

25:58.150 --> 25:59.288
- (Kat):
And it is fixed.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.651
- Entirely.

26:00.690 --> 26:03.318
- Like Aidan said, don't
give it another thought.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.987
- Great.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.328
- I hope your
friend pulls through.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.919
- Thank you.
- Eat that.

26:08.960 --> 26:09.722
(Chuckling)

26:09.760 --> 26:13.060
And, um, thank you.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.600
- You know that Kat is
one of my closest friends.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.735
- He just fixed a pipe.
There's nothing going on.

26:19.770 --> 26:23.274
- Nothing going on. Even if
there was, I can control myself.

26:23.310 --> 26:25.278
- Just stay away
from her, Aidan.

26:25.310 --> 26:26.903
I mean it.

26:26.950 --> 26:29.339
And stay away
from Erin too.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.575
- Nora.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.526
(Sirens wailing in distance)

26:47.570 --> 26:49.060
- How you feeling?

26:51.240 --> 26:54.676
Kenny, I need to know
that you're OK.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.812
(Grunts)

27:00.850 --> 27:02.909
- I thought we
were friends.

27:02.950 --> 27:05.009
- We are.

27:05.050 --> 27:08.088
Just because you made a deal
with Blake doesn't mean...

27:10.730 --> 27:13.028
that I wouldn't
protect you.

27:13.060 --> 27:15.722
- She scares me.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.568
- She should scare you.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.364
- Excuse me, Blake!

27:24.410 --> 27:27.334
Nurse Waite suggested we confirm
your visitation rights

27:27.370 --> 27:28.929
with Kenny's father.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.472
It turns out you're not
authorized to see this patient.

27:31.510 --> 27:33.103
- Surely there's been
some mistake.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.312
My brother and I
don't always agree.

27:35.350 --> 27:37.569
- Can you come
with us, please?

27:40.090 --> 27:43.458
- Just because you've read
everything about vampires

27:43.490 --> 27:45.379
that you can
get your hands on

27:45.430 --> 27:50.698
does not mean that
you understand our nature.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.197
A vampire's a killer.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.606
(Whispering):
I am a killer

28:02.640 --> 28:04.779
at my core.

28:04.810 --> 28:06.801
That's what I am.

28:06.850 --> 28:10.275
And I have to fight
against that every day.

28:12.290 --> 28:16.011
- You wouldn't hurt me.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.626
- OK, listen up.

28:26.670 --> 28:28.229
I don't know if
Blake is planning

28:28.270 --> 28:30.193
to keep her end
of the bargain,

28:30.240 --> 28:31.332
but even if she does,

28:31.370 --> 28:34.533
the relationship between
a vampire and his maker,

28:34.580 --> 28:35.672
it's complex.

28:35.710 --> 28:36.973
You are bound together,

28:37.010 --> 28:39.069
and Blake is not
the kind of person

28:39.110 --> 28:43.069
I want to see you
bound to for eternity.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.987
- I have to get out
of this hospital.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.651
She's my
only choice.

28:56.060 --> 29:00.793
- (Barb): Don't worry and
please don't be discouraged.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.094
Oh!

29:03.140 --> 29:04.437
- Hi!

29:04.470 --> 29:05.869
- Hi! Our Bridget did say

29:05.910 --> 29:07.105
that she was going to

29:07.140 --> 29:09.177
have a very special
lady friend

29:09.210 --> 29:10.700
in tow tonight.

29:10.740 --> 29:11.969
- Here I am.

29:12.010 --> 29:13.341
- Merry meet, Sally.

29:13.380 --> 29:14.643
- OK.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.671
- I am the high priestess
of this circle,

29:16.720 --> 29:18.939
but you can just
go ahead and call me Barb

29:18.990 --> 29:21.618
if we bump into each other
at the market, OK?

29:21.660 --> 29:22.980
- OK.

29:23.020 --> 29:25.125
- We are so blessed that
the Goddess chose us

29:25.160 --> 29:27.128
to receive
your energy.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.322
- Wow! Um...

29:29.360 --> 29:30.350
- Aren't we, sisters?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.470
(Chuckling nervously)

29:31.500 --> 29:32.763
- God.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.892
- All right?

29:33.940 --> 29:35.738
- (Barb):
Let's begin, shall we?

29:35.770 --> 29:37.909
- You can sit
right there.

29:46.650 --> 29:49.745
- She's got a knife, Bridge.
Why does Barb need a knife?

29:49.780 --> 29:50.884
- It's an athame.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.014
It casts the magic circle.

29:53.050 --> 29:54.313
- OK.

29:54.360 --> 29:58.058
- In the name of the Goddess,
I establish this circle.

29:59.330 --> 30:03.870
Guardian at the threshold,
unlock the door.

30:03.900 --> 30:08.098
Obey these words as
I light the spirit candle.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.601
Tonight we call Joey Smits,

30:14.640 --> 30:16.734
who wanders the otherworld

30:16.780 --> 30:19.545
in search of our
own sister in light.

30:19.580 --> 30:24.484
Joey, your wife, Beth, is
waiting is waiting for you.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.409
Walk through the door.

30:27.790 --> 30:30.157
(Whooshing)

30:31.590 --> 30:34.525
- Oh. Go, Barb.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.153
- Is Joey with us?

30:39.300 --> 30:41.029
(Blowing)

30:43.170 --> 30:46.208
Sisters, Joey
has chosen us.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.366
(Whooshing)

30:47.410 --> 30:48.536
- You Joey?

30:48.580 --> 30:50.969
- Hell no, man. Roger.

30:51.010 --> 30:53.240
Thought I'd check
out the show. You?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.612
- I like the rack
on that one.

30:55.650 --> 30:58.950
Follow her most places.
My name's Franklin.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.219
- How are ya?

31:00.250 --> 31:02.810
- Joey, reveal
yourself to Beth.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.350
- What's with this one?

31:04.390 --> 31:05.824
- Husband died.

31:05.860 --> 31:09.023
- The Goddess keeps you safe in
this place between the 2 worlds.

31:09.060 --> 31:11.290
- Tell me you haven't
given this woman

31:11.330 --> 31:12.297
any of your money.

31:12.330 --> 31:14.162
- A spirit has
joined the circle.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.760
It's the most fragile
part of the invocation.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.009
- (Barb): Joey, faithful
husband of Beth...

31:20.040 --> 31:23.169
- Oh, this one's
real open.

31:23.210 --> 31:25.702
- (Franklin):
Possessed her last week.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.104
Wasted me,
but she's worth it.

31:27.150 --> 31:28.379
- Bridge.
- I bet it was.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.570
She's a pretty,
little thing.

31:30.620 --> 31:31.712
- We need to go now.

31:31.750 --> 31:32.842
- Sally, please!

31:32.890 --> 31:35.257
- I'm serious,
we have to leave.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.180
<i>- Hey' H I Hey! om</i>

31:42.500 --> 31:43.729
(Sighing)

31:43.760 --> 31:45.296
- Give me a go, will ya?

31:45.330 --> 31:47.719
- Nah, think I'll
stay the night,

31:47.770 --> 31:49.898
maybe take her home,
get her alone.

31:49.940 --> 31:52.910
- No, you won't! Hey, I'm
talking to you, Roger!

31:56.580 --> 31:58.002
- YOU Can see us.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.075
- Stay the hell out of her!

32:00.110 --> 32:02.374
- Excuse me, but our
sister, Beth, here

32:02.420 --> 32:05.082
was about to connect
with her late husband!

32:05.120 --> 32:06.884
- I'm so sorry,
High Priestess.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.082
- Bridge,
Joey isn't even here.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.157
- Oh, you can see us.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.921
- Why don't you keep your hands
to yourself for once?

32:13.960 --> 32:15.325
- Look, I know
it's rough.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.896
I used to be
one of you.

32:16.930 --> 32:18.659
- You used to be...

32:18.700 --> 32:20.759
- (Men): ...one of us?
- Uh-oh.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.529
- Did you get your door?
- Let us in!

32:22.570 --> 32:23.799
- What's happening?

32:23.840 --> 32:25.831
- Who are you?
- Did you take your door?

32:25.870 --> 32:27.269
- Get away!
Please, stop!

32:33.010 --> 32:35.877
Sorry, this body's taken.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.546
Anyone else?

32:39.820 --> 32:41.914
(Panting)

32:50.500 --> 32:53.322
(Crickets chirping)

33:01.310 --> 33:02.869
- Hold on there,
Aunt Blake.

33:02.910 --> 33:05.470
- Out of the way.
I'm starving!

33:05.510 --> 33:08.241
- I am very impressed with
how quickly you've managed

33:08.280 --> 33:10.078
to compel your
way past security,

33:10.120 --> 33:11.610
but you're
still too late.

33:16.090 --> 33:19.128
(Whispering):
I've agreed to turn Kenny.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.689
- I won't forget this.

33:24.930 --> 33:26.295
When this is over,

33:26.330 --> 33:29.868
the survivors should know
you're choosing humans

33:29.900 --> 33:31.265
over your own kind,

33:31.310 --> 33:33.699
even in the face
of extinction.

33:36.480 --> 33:40.348
I thought you weren't interested
in fathering anymore sons.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.541
- I'm not.

33:41.580 --> 33:45.949
But I'm willing to do it
to protect him from you.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.734
(Car honking)

34:07.810 --> 34:09.676
(Sighing)

34:12.150 --> 34:14.175
(Alarm system beeping)

34:15.219 --> 34:17.018
- Go out with me.

34:18.449 --> 34:19.781
- I'm kind of in
for the night.

34:19.820 --> 34:22.482
- Oh, no, no. That's
not what I mean. Not now.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.579
I just decided that
I wanted to ask you

34:24.630 --> 34:27.382
and I needed to do it right
away for some reason.

34:27.429 --> 34:31.196
Hey, I promise I don't have
any heads in my freezer.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.197
- I'm free
Thursday night.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.992
- Great. Dinner?

34:38.040 --> 34:39.132
- I enjoy dinner.

34:39.170 --> 34:40.899
- OK, good.
Carleton House.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.476
You are gonna
love this place.

34:42.510 --> 34:45.241
- Oh, I make it a rule
to boycott restaurants

34:45.280 --> 34:46.600
that serve foie gras.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.846
- Some place else.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.938
- Some place else.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.344
(Car honking)

34:52.389 --> 34:54.585
You'll figure it out.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.058
(Man and woman singing
lyrics indistinct)

35:01.600 --> 35:03.398
* ...across your skin

35:03.430 --> 35:05.524
* If you want me

35:05.570 --> 35:08.494
* I couldn't hear
the words..

35:08.540 --> 35:13.137
(Man and woman singing,
lyrics indistinct)

35:17.910 --> 35:20.504
* Come sit with me...

35:20.550 --> 35:22.644
- Hey.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.148
- Hey.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.615
* And T'll take
what you are... *

35:29.660 --> 35:31.219
- Come here.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.793
(Sighing)

35:38.200 --> 35:40.419
- Do you want
any of this?

35:40.470 --> 35:41.562
- No.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.138
* Bring your branches down... *

35:48.610 --> 35:51.272
- Can I tell
you something?

35:55.020 --> 36:00.049
You are my person.

36:00.090 --> 36:02.718
You're everything
to me, everything.

36:05.490 --> 36:09.700
And even if Aidan is
like a brother to me...

36:13.100 --> 36:16.092
I will always choose you.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.563
Always.

36:22.480 --> 36:27.600
* Bring your branches down

36:28.750 --> 36:29.717
OK?

36:29.750 --> 36:30.979
(Sighs)

36:31.020 --> 36:32.283
- OK.

36:32.320 --> 36:37.190
* It's your kindling now *

36:46.430 --> 36:48.865
(EKG monitor beeping)

36:56.280 --> 36:58.908
- Hey.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.406
I need you to know

37:00.450 --> 37:03.579
none of this
will be in vain.

37:04.720 --> 37:08.759
You are fulfilling
your destiny.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.922
You have served
the will of the pack.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.404
(Grunting)

37:31.010 --> 37:32.671
(Grunting stops)

37:35.420 --> 37:38.583
(Continuous beep)

37:51.130 --> 37:52.666
(Crickets chirping)

37:52.700 --> 37:56.398
- The ghosts,
what did they want?

37:57.300 --> 37:59.405
What did you want

37:59.440 --> 38:01.204
when you were
one of them?

38:01.240 --> 38:04.346
- We all want
something different.

38:04.380 --> 38:08.647
We all have regrets
and things to say.

38:08.680 --> 38:12.048
And after a while,
it just...

38:13.290 --> 38:15.486
starts to consume you.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.158
Bridge, um...

38:21.030 --> 38:24.364
the reason you feel
your mind empty

38:24.400 --> 38:26.869
during the Wicca circle...

38:27.970 --> 38:30.860
is because the ghosts
that show up...

38:32.740 --> 38:34.230
they're possessing you.

38:35.340 --> 38:39.777
So, it's not really a good,
meditative kind of mind-emptying

38:39.810 --> 38:42.279
so much as a ghost
taking up

38:42.320 --> 38:44.880
valuable real estate
in your body

38:44.920 --> 38:47.719
and slowly driving
you insane.

38:49.690 --> 38:51.829
Trust me,
I've seen it.

38:54.190 --> 38:55.749
I've done it.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.622
- But if, uh,
if I could help them,

38:58.670 --> 39:01.890
if they could move on
because of me...

39:01.940 --> 39:02.896
- No.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.738
No.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.777
I did this to you.

39:09.810 --> 39:13.348
I'm the reason you got
dragged into this whole world.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.780
Bridge...

39:21.460 --> 39:23.053
In order to move on,

39:23.090 --> 39:27.527
you need to forget
about spirits and ghosts.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.524
And I think you need
to forget about me too.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.536
I have my body back,

39:36.570 --> 39:40.461
but I'm never gonna
have my old life back.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.569
Too much has happened.

39:42.610 --> 39:45.944
But you can
have yours.

39:46.980 --> 39:48.675
I want you to have this.

39:52.950 --> 39:57.512
Wear it every day.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.823
Every day.

40:01.290 --> 40:03.395
It'll keep
us connected.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.265
Consider it me
watching over you.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.940
* So didn't you find love

40:09.970 --> 40:11.631
And Bridge...

40:11.670 --> 40:13.468
You didn't fail me.

40:13.510 --> 40:15.399
_ * Or salvation
in what they do *

40:15.440 --> 40:17.431
You saved me.

40:18.580 --> 40:21.811
* A heart is built of gold

40:21.850 --> 40:24.615
* The fairies they are too

40:24.650 --> 40:27.244
* It's in the hands you hold

40:27.290 --> 40:29.213
(EKG monitor beeping rapidly)

40:29.260 --> 40:30.409
(Continuous beep)

40:30.460 --> 40:33.486
* Ooh

40:35.400 --> 40:39.121
* Ooh

40:40.670 --> 40:43.230
* And I don't feel
like I'm falling *

40:43.270 --> 40:45.659
* I'm up against the sky

40:45.710 --> 40:48.771
* I said I'm taking it all in

40:48.810 --> 40:51.780
* To make the good life

40:51.810 --> 40:54.677
* And I don't feel
like I'm falling *

40:54.720 --> 40:56.518
* I'm up against the sky

40:56.550 --> 40:57.915
(Sobbing)

40:57.950 --> 40:59.782
* Let's grab the heart
of the world *

40:59.820 --> 41:02.755
* And turn into the light *

41:36.090 --> 41:38.013
(Choking)

41:38.060 --> 41:39.152
- How?

41:39.190 --> 41:42.797
- Purity of lineage
has its advantages.

41:44.130 --> 41:45.393
- Purebred.

41:45.430 --> 41:48.695
Well, there aren't many
of my kind left in Boston,

41:48.740 --> 41:50.959
but one of them
is a purebred killer.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.335
He lives right
around here.

41:53.370 --> 41:56.340
Maybe one night the two of
you will run into each other

41:56.380 --> 41:57.575
in a dark alley.

42:03.780 --> 42:06.841
(Crickets chirping)

42:11.690 --> 42:14.489
* We're gonna be fine

42:14.530 --> 42:16.589
* It's gonna be fine

42:16.630 --> 42:18.428
* It's gonna be fine

42:18.460 --> 42:19.666
* It's gonna be fine

42:19.700 --> 42:21.668
* Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

42:21.700 --> 42:23.737
(Gasps)

42:32.310 --> 42:34.005
(Gasps)

42:34.820 --> 42:36.777
- (Screaming):
Josh!

42:36.820 --> 42:39.812
* It's gonna be fine
It's gonna be fine *

42:39.850 --> 42:42.512
* It's gonna be fine

42:42.560 --> 42:45.757
* It's gonna be fine

42:47.090 --> 42:49.991
* We're gonna say it is

42:52.900 --> 42:54.868
* Oh yeah

42:54.900 --> 42:54.968
* We're gonna say it is *
