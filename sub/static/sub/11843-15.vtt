28:52.429 --> 28:54.989

an eyes on things.

29:05.108 --> 29:08.169
Well, then don't give me up.

<i>- [ Max ] So everythingk okay?
- Oh, yeah, great.</i>

29:21.458 --> 29:23.620
Michael, about Hank
being missing...

29:23.693 --> 29:26.185
you didn't-you didn't
do anything to him, did you?

29:26.262 --> 29:28.356
- No. What, you thought-
- <i>No.</i>

29:28.431 --> 29:30.331
- No.
- So, what did Valenti say?

29:30.400 --> 29:34.530
Well, he said he's gonna find me
a new foster situation.

29:34.604 --> 29:37.869
<i>N01' a “home,”
A “situation "</i>

29:37.941 --> 29:40.876
- I'm sure he meant that- - No matter what home
I get, it's a substitute for the real one.

29:40.944 --> 29:43.675
- Michael, you can't just run away.
- Watch me.

29:43.746 --> 29:47.376
- [ Sighs ] Where are you supposed to go?
- Anywhere but here.

29:49.319 --> 29:52.653
You two can stay in your nice little world with
your pot roast and your Monopoly games...

29:52.722 --> 29:55.657
<i>'cause it's pretty clear to me you're not
interested in finding our real home.</i>

29:55.725 --> 29:59.093
But I'm going to.
I'm gonna find Nasedo.

29:59.162 --> 30:03.156
- He's my family.
- And what are we?

30:03.233 --> 30:06.533
<i>You wanna know what I think? I think
it's time you either put up orshut up.</i>

30:06.603 --> 30:09.698
- Very <i>poetic, Isabel.</i>
- <i>You act like a five year 0/0'.</i>

30:09.772 --> 30:12.571
When are you gonna grow up
and stop blaming everybody else?

30:12.642 --> 30:14.940
Is that what you think, Max?

30:15.011 --> 30:18.208
I think
it's not safe out there.

30:18.281 --> 30:20.272
I think Nasedo
is dangerous, Michael.

30:20.350 --> 30:22.614
- <i>You don't</i> know that.
<i>- You heard what Hubble said.</i>

30:22.685 --> 30:25.950
He's a killer, a shape-shifter,
and he's out there.

30:26.022 --> 30:30.255
He could be anyone. We need
to stick together now more than ever.

30:33.897 --> 30:35.888
You're wrong, Max.

30:41.237 --> 30:43.296
Go on and run, Michael.
It's what you do best.

31:09.899 --> 31:12.095
I know we've been

31:12.168 --> 31:16.162
Yeah. There's- There's some more
important things to talk about though.

31:18.241 --> 31:20.232
I heard about Michael.

31:21.611 --> 31:23.602
You okay?

31:26.516 --> 31:28.507
Not really.

31:30.119 --> 31:32.213
L'vejust never
seen him so upset.

31:34.424 --> 31:37.257
I have this weird feeling
that he-

31:37.327 --> 31:39.489
he'sjust gonna leave
without even saying good-bye.

31:41.864 --> 31:44.492
You know, maybe
because if he did...

31:46.269 --> 31:49.569
he wouldn't be able
to go through with it.

31:49.639 --> 31:51.630
I can't lose him.

32:13.329 --> 32:16.094
I thought
I locked that door.

32:16.165 --> 32:19.032
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, you did.

32:22.071 --> 32:26.406
- What are you doin'?
-[Sighs]You see this?

32:26.476 --> 32:29.309
This is all I know
about who we are-

32:29.379 --> 32:33.316
these stones that River Dog gave us
at the cave when Michael was sick.

32:33.383 --> 32:35.579
They're the only thing we have
from the place we came from.

32:35.652 --> 32:39.782
<i>It was the first time I realized
we had a home somewhere...</i>

32:41.024 --> 32:43.152
a real place.

32:43.226 --> 32:48.426
<i>But they don't mean anything,
not without Michael.</i>

33:02.712 --> 33:05.647
Packing?

33:05.715 --> 33:08.685
If you could call it that.

33:08.751 --> 33:10.879
Everything I have
fits in this bag.

33:10.953 --> 33:15.322
- You have me. You have Isabel.
- Say good-bye, Max.

33:15.391 --> 33:17.689
- I can't.
- We'll keep in touch, all right?

33:17.760 --> 33:19.694
- It's not good enough.
- It's gonna have to be.

33:19.762 --> 33:22.959
- All right? So say good-bye.
- I can't.

33:23.032 --> 33:25.126
- Max-
- I know what you're scared of.

33:25.201 --> 33:29.399
- No, you don't.
- You keep telling me how lucky I am...

33:29.472 --> 33:32.305
to have a great home,
great parents.

33:32.375 --> 33:36.369
But, in one way, it's harder for me because,
when I screw up, I have no excuses.

33:36.446 --> 33:39.905
But you- you can do and say anything
you want because you have Hank...

33:39.982 --> 33:42.508
<i>and you can blame it on that.</i>

33:44.387 --> 33:48.221
But what happens without him?
It'll all be on you.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.817
That's what.

33:50.893 --> 33:53.089
Well, leave it up to me
to still screw it up, huh?

<i>It's okay, Michael, because if you do,
we'll all still be there for you.</i>

33:58.301 --> 34:01.396
<i>Maybe you have to start thinking about
someone other than yourself</i>

34:01.471 --> 34:05.374
The three of us belong together.
There's a reason that we're together.

34:07.677 --> 34:09.907
We're a family.
