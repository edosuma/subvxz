01:10.868 --> 01:14.099
OK.

01:55.446 --> 01:56.811
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:56.881 --> 01:59.076
- Is this yours?
- Dad.

01:59.150 --> 02:00.845
Didn't think so.

02:13.030 --> 02:15.396
Hey.

02:15.466 --> 02:18.026
Hey, I was gonna
do that for you later.

02:18.102 --> 02:20.969
Now you won't have to.

02:21.038 --> 02:24.735
- OK. OK, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

02:24.809 --> 02:25.867
- Cereal?
- OK.

02:25.943 --> 02:27.274
All right.

02:27.345 --> 02:30.371
- So the plan...
- The plan.

02:30.448 --> 02:32.416
Cara, Dad's about
to reveal "the plan."

02:32.483 --> 02:35.748
I'll pack up the car,
pick you up right after school,

02:35.820 --> 02:40.348
and then we'll drive
straight... through.

02:40.424 --> 02:43.291
<i>- Sounds good.
- Does not.</i>

02:43.361 --> 02:45.625
- What now?
- Well, isn't the whole point

02:45.696 --> 02:48.256
that we go to school? You're
forcing us to miss school

02:48.332 --> 02:50.698
when we should be,
like, in school.

02:50.768 --> 02:53.760
Right? I mean,
what about my studies?

02:53.838 --> 02:55.305
OK, why are you smiling?

02:55.373 --> 02:58.399
I just never thought I'd hear you say,
"What about my studies?"

02:58.476 --> 03:02.105
It makes me, like, smile.

03:02.179 --> 03:05.580
- I don't wanna go.
- We do this every year.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.709
Only time we can get
the family together.

03:07.785 --> 03:09.980
Gotta help Grandma
and Grandpa.

03:10.054 --> 03:12.045
- Go.
- You're destroying my education.

03:12.123 --> 03:14.421
Change.

03:16.294 --> 03:17.784
- Yes?
- Very good column, sir.

03:17.862 --> 03:19.557
That bit about curfews?
Very apt.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.757
And may I also say
that yesterday's column

03:21.832 --> 03:23.823
on boundary
setting was excellent.

03:23.901 --> 03:26.062
- Who are you?
- I'm Marty Barasco.

03:26.137 --> 03:29.038
I would like to thank you
for last Friday's column.

03:29.106 --> 03:30.937
It helped me understand my parents.

03:31.008 --> 03:32.999
OK.

03:33.077 --> 03:35.671
Well, Marty,
what else can I do for you?

03:35.746 --> 03:38.306
I'd like to see your daughter,
sir. If I could.

03:38.382 --> 03:41.146
Ah. Jane. Jane!

03:41.218 --> 03:43.311
Actually, I'm here for Cara.

03:45.623 --> 03:48.217
Nice to meet you, Marty.
Come back in two years.

03:50.828 --> 03:52.819
I don't wanna brag,
but Mr. Shaff says

03:52.897 --> 03:56.094
I'm one of the best drivers in his
class. He says I'm highway ready.

03:56.167 --> 03:57.600
Mr. Shaff and I may not agree.

03:57.668 --> 03:59.761
- Cara! Let's go.
- So will you let me?

03:59.837 --> 04:03.295
We'll see. 3pm sharp.
Do not be...

04:03.374 --> 04:05.171
- Late. We got it.
...late.

04:05.242 --> 04:07.107
Yes, we do.

04:07.178 --> 04:10.306
FYI, that boy you were really rude to
before is my friend, Marty,

04:10.381 --> 04:13.976
my lab partner from class. We're
doing an extra-credit project together.

04:14.051 --> 04:15.951
Bus.

04:16.019 --> 04:18.317
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

04:18.389 --> 04:20.550
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

05:04.368 --> 05:06.199
Yeah?

05:06.270 --> 05:09.364
Yeah, Jordy,
I e-mailed it half an hour ago.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.771
What?

05:12.109 --> 05:14.771
No way. You're kidding.

05:23.254 --> 05:24.448
That's funny.

05:24.522 --> 05:27.514
- Where's your sister?
- You're late.

05:27.591 --> 05:30.617
She went to Yumms.
Can I drive?

05:30.694 --> 05:32.992
- Dad's going to be syndicated.
- Not so fast.

05:33.063 --> 05:35.224
There're others being considered...

05:35.299 --> 05:38.700
Aw, that's great. Can I drive?

05:45.309 --> 05:49.211
Look. You're a fine driver. It's the
just the other hundred million dr...

05:49.280 --> 05:51.111
If you don't let me,
I'll never learn.

05:51.182 --> 05:54.447
But if I let you,
you may not live.

06:30.254 --> 06:31.983
What was that?
What are you doing?

06:32.056 --> 06:35.787
- Could you be more embarrassing?
- Sorry to interrupt your studies.

06:35.860 --> 06:39.796
Well, we can't all
be monks like you. No.

06:39.864 --> 06:42.697
- By the way, you're grounded.
- Oh, I'm grounded?

06:42.766 --> 06:44.028
Mm-hmm. For how long?

06:44.101 --> 06:46.626
- For life.
- Dad, come on.

06:46.704 --> 06:48.604
- It's humiliating.
- Tell me about it.

06:48.672 --> 06:50.139
Grounded for a month.

06:50.207 --> 06:53.267
A month! But that's
worse than forever.

06:53.344 --> 06:56.370
- OK, Dad, why?
- You lied to me.

06:56.447 --> 06:58.779
Yeah, well,
you can't handle the truth.

06:58.849 --> 07:00.373
Try me next time.

07:00.451 --> 07:02.885
- But... but...
- No, no. No. No.

07:02.953 --> 07:06.354
- OK, Dad. I... I love Marty.
- Oh, please.

07:07.791 --> 07:10.817
- OK.
- Come on.

07:10.895 --> 07:13.455
Dad, Dad. Dad, Dad, stop.
OK, just listen. Listen.

07:13.531 --> 07:15.624
I didn't know right away.
It took me a while.

07:15.699 --> 07:18.259
- What's a while?
- I've known him for three weeks,

07:18.335 --> 07:19.927
but I knew in three days.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.871
You can't know in three days.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.669
- Well, maybe she can.
- No, no. No.

07:24.742 --> 07:27.040
What you're feeling
is not love.

07:27.111 --> 07:30.478
- It is young and reckless.
- Yes, it is. I love him.

07:30.548 --> 07:33.779
- You may think it's love, it is not!
- No, I love him. I love him.

07:33.851 --> 07:35.910
- No, it's not. No, it's not.
- I love him.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.477
I love him. I love him.

08:07.651 --> 08:09.585
Dad? You OK?

08:09.653 --> 08:12.451
There goes
Jane's college education.

08:12.523 --> 08:15.083
There goes Cara's.

08:15.159 --> 08:18.219
- Oh, no. What about mine?
- No, you're good.

08:18.295 --> 08:20.627
Ah, no, wait. There it goes.

08:24.435 --> 08:26.630
You can't keep me from Marty.

08:28.672 --> 08:32.802
Dad, let me remind you
that guys are half the world,

08:32.876 --> 08:35.708
and I'll find others.

08:35.779 --> 08:38.907
But know that only
Marty gets my heart.

08:38.982 --> 08:40.610
In the car.

08:42.519 --> 08:45.977
- I know a really good driver.
- No.

08:46.056 --> 08:47.546
No.

08:55.332 --> 08:56.697
Here you go.

08:58.736 --> 09:01.136
I think your sisters
aren't very happy with me.

09:01.205 --> 09:04.641
- Duh.
- Why do you think?

09:04.708 --> 09:09.168
You're a good father,
but sometimes a bad dad.

09:10.881 --> 09:14.248
- Who told you to say that?
- No one.

09:14.318 --> 09:16.582
Was it Jane or Cara?
You can tell me.

09:16.654 --> 09:18.645
- I made it up myself.
- No. You didn't.

09:18.722 --> 09:21.885
Which one of your sisters
told you to say that?

09:21.959 --> 09:24.189
I made it up myself.
I'm in the fourth grade.

09:24.261 --> 09:26.957
- I can make things up for myself.
- Jane or Cara?

09:27.031 --> 09:30.194
- I made it up myself.
- Jane or Cara?

09:30.267 --> 09:33.236
- I'm in the fourth grade.
- She's in the fourth grade!

10:18.949 --> 10:21.349
Oh, they're here.

10:21.418 --> 10:25.184
<i>They're here. Come, girls.</i>

10:25.255 --> 10:27.621
- Hey, Poppy.
- Good to see you.

10:27.691 --> 10:29.124
Hi, Lil.

10:30.294 --> 10:31.591
Hey, Dad.

10:35.065 --> 10:36.794
- Well, now we're all here.
- Mm-hm.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.392
- How you doing?
- Uh, fine. Or maybe not.

10:39.470 --> 10:42.667
- My kids can't stand me.
- Means you're doing something right.

10:46.043 --> 10:49.535
Oh, you're so...
Hiya, honey.

10:49.613 --> 10:52.104
Look at your girls.
They're all grown up.

10:52.182 --> 10:53.979
No, no, no.
They're still very young.

10:54.051 --> 10:56.076
- Come on, Lilly. Lilly.
- Hey, how are you?

10:56.153 --> 10:58.621
- She's getting big.
- Getting bigger every day.

10:58.689 --> 11:00.350
- Hey, man.
- Dan the man.

11:01.825 --> 11:03.884
Good to see you.

11:03.961 --> 11:05.292
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:05.362 --> 11:08.923
- Hi, Uncle Dan.
- Hey, Eileen, how are you?

11:08.999 --> 11:11.797
- Did you hit traffic?
- Yeah, it wasn't... eh, not too bad.

11:11.869 --> 11:14.030
- Hi, sis. Good to see you.
- Glad you're here.

11:14.104 --> 11:16.664
Who are they? I've never
seen these guys in my life.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.833
- Hi, Uncle Dan.
- Say something.

11:18.909 --> 11:22.208
- Something.
- It happened. I knew it. Way to go.

11:22.279 --> 11:25.442
- Sounds good.
- Help your uncle with his bags, OK?

11:27.818 --> 11:30.343
Honey, you're down here.

11:30.420 --> 11:33.184
Your brother, Mitch, has
a friend coming to visit, so...

11:33.257 --> 11:34.815
- I'm in the special room.
- Yeah.

11:34.892 --> 11:37.588
- Sorry, bro.
- That's OK.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.995
- You sleep tight.
- You too.

12:14.565 --> 12:16.692
- You tired?
- Get down, get down!

12:16.767 --> 12:18.632
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12:18.702 --> 12:20.465
- Sleep OK?
- Yeah.

12:20.537 --> 12:23.529
- Get down!
- Can I get you guys something?

12:23.607 --> 12:25.472
Get a life.

12:31.748 --> 12:34.444
- She just needs some space.
- That's not what she needs.

12:34.518 --> 12:36.611
Yeah. She does.

12:36.687 --> 12:39.178
From the sound of things,
you all do.

12:39.256 --> 12:41.622
Yeah, why don't you
go get the papers?

12:41.692 --> 12:44.490
- Oh, Mom.
- Yeah, go on.

12:44.561 --> 12:48.224
It would do you good.
Get lost for a little while.

12:48.298 --> 12:51.495
- Maybe I should stick around.
- No. Get lost, Danny.

12:51.568 --> 12:53.593
It's not a request.

13:55.632 --> 13:57.623
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.614
- Good morning.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

14:17.688 --> 14:19.417
Oh.

14:19.489 --> 14:22.515
Well, then he went downtown.

14:22.592 --> 14:25.083
Yeah. For coffee. Right.

14:25.162 --> 14:27.130
Talks to him on weekends.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.328
Hi. Excuse me. Could you help?

14:32.402 --> 14:35.735
Um... Yes.

14:35.806 --> 14:39.606
I'm looking for a book,
obviously.

14:39.676 --> 14:42.907
- Anything in particular?
- Yeah, something that can help me

14:42.980 --> 14:45.949
deal with, um...

14:47.617 --> 14:50.051
...what might be
an awkward situation.

14:50.120 --> 14:54.921
Oh. OK. Um, what...
what's kind of, um...

14:54.992 --> 14:57.290
Well, something funny
might be nice.

14:57.361 --> 15:01.855
But not necessarily big, "ha ha ha,"
laugh-out-loud funny,

15:01.932 --> 15:05.060
you know, and certainly not
make-fun-of-other-people funny,

15:05.135 --> 15:09.697
but rather something,
uh, human funny.

15:09.773 --> 15:12.105
OK.

15:12.175 --> 15:15.338
And, uh, if it could, um,

15:15.412 --> 15:17.312
sneak up on you,
surprise you,

15:17.381 --> 15:21.408
and at the same time make
you think that what you thought

15:21.485 --> 15:24.750
was not only right
in a wrong kind of way,

15:24.821 --> 15:28.018
but when you're wrong,
there's a certain rightness

15:28.091 --> 15:31.117
- to your wrongness.
- Um...

15:31.194 --> 15:35.062
Well, maybe what
I mean is, um,

15:35.132 --> 15:40.968
more importantly, I'm looking
to be swept up.

15:41.038 --> 15:43.370
And at the same time, not.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.568
Meaning I wanna feel, uh,

15:46.643 --> 15:51.273
a deep connection to, uh, something.

15:51.348 --> 15:53.612
Or maybe I don't know
what I'm looking for.

15:53.683 --> 15:56.777
Well, in my experience, you rarely
find it all in just one book.

15:56.853 --> 15:59.117
- Oh.
- Maybe that's why there're so many.

15:59.189 --> 16:00.281
- Hmm.
- Um...

16:00.357 --> 16:04.726
- So, what do we have?
- We have a smattering, a sort of

16:04.795 --> 16:06.956
- potpourri of possibilities.
- Potpourri?

16:07.030 --> 16:10.227
Yeah. Um, here we go.
We have, uh, poetry.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.632
Dickinson, you know, basic stuff.

16:12.702 --> 16:15.796
- Little Neruda is always good.
- I agree.

16:15.872 --> 16:18.966
Oh, now, this is actually
a real page-turner.

16:19.042 --> 16:21.772
<i>The Life of Gandhi?
I... No, but he...</i>

16:21.845 --> 16:26.214
Nobody has ever
been quite so cool as him.

16:26.283 --> 16:29.446
<i>Um, lighthouses.
A Good Man Is Hard to Find.</i>

16:29.519 --> 16:32.784
<i>- Uh, the title alone.
- Anna Karenina. I don't...</i>

16:32.856 --> 16:35.586
Oh, now, that's funny.

16:35.659 --> 16:38.492
No, actually, no,
funny is here.

16:40.964 --> 16:43.489
Maybe it's not that funny.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.967
No, actually that's funny.
Very funny, and true.

16:46.036 --> 16:49.301
Good. OK, good. Um...

16:49.372 --> 16:53.399
But, uh, if you
could pick only one.

16:53.477 --> 16:56.742
Ah. Well, I would say

16:56.813 --> 16:59.577
that nothing rivals

16:59.649 --> 17:03.881
<i>the romance of Fishcliff.</i>

17:03.954 --> 17:08.015
I'm being honest. I just walked around
and I just grabbed stuff.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.955
I just grabbed
whatever I could grab.

17:10.026 --> 17:11.925
- You were lookin' for?
- Sold.

17:11.994 --> 17:13.826
- I'm sorry?
- I want them all.

17:13.896 --> 17:15.592
These were just
suggestions, I...

17:15.665 --> 17:17.690
Make sure he gets
the commission for this.

17:17.767 --> 17:20.998
- He doesn't work here.
- Well, he should.

17:24.273 --> 17:27.573
You are smooth.

17:27.644 --> 17:30.545
Uh, actually,
no, I'm not smooth.

17:30.614 --> 17:36.553
I'm, uh, Dan. Sorry.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.145
Marie.

17:39.222 --> 17:43.158
Hey. Hi.

17:43.226 --> 17:47.287
Um, so, Marie,
can I make it up to you?

17:48.365 --> 17:50.959
OK. Here is your tea. Hot.

17:51.034 --> 17:54.003
Watch it.
And there is my orange juice.

17:54.070 --> 17:57.096
And I bought a muffin,
but I think

17:57.174 --> 18:00.871
they gave me a small planet.

18:00.944 --> 18:03.310
I should put that down.

18:03.380 --> 18:06.611
- Thank you.
- I have napkins and utensils.

18:06.683 --> 18:09.481
I'm a big believer in forks.

18:09.553 --> 18:11.987
And you are not,
apparently.

18:12.055 --> 18:13.317
- So, Dan...
- Yes.

18:13.390 --> 18:17.190
- You were born?
- I was born.

18:17.260 --> 18:22.698
Like everybody else. And I grew up,
like everybody else. Good?

18:22.766 --> 18:26.065
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

18:26.136 --> 18:28.070
Um, OK. What else?

18:28.138 --> 18:31.665
<i>I went to school,
and I had a Bonanza lunch pail.</i>

18:31.741 --> 18:34.676
This show, '60s, a TV show.

18:34.744 --> 18:37.178
When I was ten,
I wanted to be a magician.

18:37.247 --> 18:40.739
So I used to hold these magic shows
for all the kids in the neighborhood.

18:40.817 --> 18:43.684
I tried to make
a neighborhood girl levitate.

18:43.753 --> 18:48.918
And she didn't. And it involved
a body cast, and several stitches...

18:48.992 --> 18:52.484
...the end of my...

19:03.273 --> 19:07.232
Let me tell you something,
something I've never...

19:07.310 --> 19:12.338
You're gonna laugh.
Something I've never told anybody...

19:12.415 --> 19:13.848
...in my life.

19:13.917 --> 19:17.375
Um, and this is really hard
for me to say.

19:20.156 --> 19:24.752
And then she got, uh, sick.

19:24.828 --> 19:27.763
And, um, then she was gone.

19:29.165 --> 19:31.190
And, uh...

19:33.570 --> 19:35.538
It's taken a while.

19:37.941 --> 19:40.705
We should probably talk
about something else.

19:40.777 --> 19:44.838
So you're telling me that you're one of
those widowers with three daughters

19:44.914 --> 19:47.712
who preys on unsuspecting
women in bookstores?

19:47.784 --> 19:50.776
- It seems that would be me.
- Been there.

19:50.854 --> 19:53.584
Really?

19:56.026 --> 19:58.551
No, it seems that it's been...

20:00.697 --> 20:04.690
...seriously hard.
- No. Um...

20:04.768 --> 20:08.829
No, we're OK now.
We're really OK.

20:08.905 --> 20:12.033
You don't have to smile.

20:13.843 --> 20:15.606
Better than the alternative.

20:15.679 --> 20:18.910
Ah.

20:18.982 --> 20:20.847
- Can you hold?
- Mm-hmm.

20:23.019 --> 20:24.350
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

20:24.421 --> 20:29.415
Hi. No, no,
I'm minutes away. Yes.

20:29.492 --> 20:33.394
- Um, I have to go.
- Oh. OK.

20:35.732 --> 20:38.633
I just lost track of time.

20:38.702 --> 20:40.863
I wish we could keep talking.

20:40.937 --> 20:45.271
Well, it was nice, and a bit unusual,
meeting you.

20:45.342 --> 20:48.903
- Maybe I can call you sometime?
- Uh, that might be awkward.

20:48.978 --> 20:52.243
- 'Cause you're in a relationship?
- Yes. A new one.

20:52.315 --> 20:54.579
I would've found out
if I hadn't been talking.

20:54.651 --> 20:57.643
- That's true.
- But it's not exactly fair, is it?

20:57.721 --> 21:00.485
- I mean, you know all about me...
- Thank you.

21:00.557 --> 21:04.391
And I know nothing about you. I don't
wanna go through the rest of my life

21:04.461 --> 21:07.794
wondering about the woman in the
bookstore who let me do the talking.

21:07.864 --> 21:12.392
All we'd be is two people
finishing a conversation.

21:12.469 --> 21:17.406
Uh... OK.
No harm in that.

21:22.245 --> 21:24.406
Oh, OK.

21:26.649 --> 21:29.914
Call. Or don't, but, uh, call.

21:36.059 --> 21:38.755
Oh! Um, hey, hey, hey!

21:38.828 --> 21:42.855
Just so you know, um, I would even call
to say I'm not calling.

21:42.932 --> 21:45.264
Hmm.

21:48.304 --> 21:51.501
Um...

21:54.210 --> 21:55.802
OK.

22:00.450 --> 22:05.615
"I'd even call to say I'm not calling?"
Wow.

22:07.257 --> 22:08.952
Sorry. Sorry!

22:22.005 --> 22:25.406
I, um... I never do this
kind of thing, officer.

22:25.475 --> 22:29.002
I'm usually very careful.

22:29.078 --> 22:31.638
And nobody believes in...

22:31.714 --> 22:33.579
- Welcome to Rhode Island.
- Yeah, OK.

22:33.650 --> 22:35.242
Yeah, it's nice to be here.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.588
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:42.659 --> 22:46.220
- What's wrong?
- Nobody.

22:46.296 --> 22:48.594
I mean, nothing.

22:48.665 --> 22:50.257
Danny's back.

22:56.506 --> 22:58.474
- Dude, are you all right?
- What? Yeah.

22:58.541 --> 23:02.033
- No, no, no, I'm good. I'm good. Yeah.
- Really?

23:02.111 --> 23:04.102
'Cause you don't...
you don't seem good.

23:04.180 --> 23:09.117
Well, it was the strangest thing.
I, um...

23:10.186 --> 23:13.155
- Wow.
- Wow what?

23:14.858 --> 23:18.521
I met somebody,
and she's really something.

23:18.595 --> 23:22.463
- Hot damn!
- Bro, that is beyond huge!

23:22.532 --> 23:23.897
- You got her number?
- Yeah.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.764
- You gonna call?
- It's complicated.

23:25.835 --> 23:27.598
No, it's simple.
You've gotta call.

23:27.670 --> 23:30.400
No, he just met her. He's
probably worried it's too soon.

23:30.473 --> 23:33.874
No, it's never too soon.
Especially for somebody his age.

23:33.943 --> 23:35.638
- Amy, Dan met someone.
- Shh...

23:35.712 --> 23:37.577
- He met someone?
- Dan met someone?

23:37.647 --> 23:39.740
- Come here. How soon till he can call?
- Shh.

23:39.816 --> 23:42.046
I don't know. I haven't
been single for years.

23:42.118 --> 23:44.882
- Me neither. My God, who is she?
- Uncle Dan met someone?

23:44.954 --> 23:47.047
Dan met a hottie.

23:47.123 --> 23:49.421
All right, all right.
That is enough.

23:49.492 --> 23:51.357
You know what?
Let's ask Annie.

23:51.427 --> 23:52.724
- Just now?
- Now.

23:52.795 --> 23:55.730
- What does she look like?
- Um...

23:55.798 --> 23:58.665
- She...
- What's the, um?

24:00.703 --> 24:04.139
- The question?
- This is my brother, Dan.

24:04.207 --> 24:07.870
And, um, he needs your advice.
He met some hottie downtown,

24:07.944 --> 24:10.412
and, um... She's a little shell-shocked.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.607
Wouldn't you be?
Mitch neglects to mention

24:12.682 --> 24:15.810
that in their weekend away, she's gonna
meet our entire family.

24:15.885 --> 24:20.288
- I didn't want to scare her off.
- Let's go, everybody! Let's go.

24:20.356 --> 24:22.221
Congratulations.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.021
So, um, Annie?

24:26.095 --> 24:28.256
It's Anne-Marie.
Um, Mitch calls me Annie,

24:28.331 --> 24:30.526
but, uh, I'm
Marie everywhere else.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.932
I've two Marys and
a Martha in my exercise class,

24:33.002 --> 24:37.098
- so I didn't wanna confuse people.
- No. That would be not good.

24:37.173 --> 24:40.165
- I... I prefer Marie.
- Come on, sweetie.

24:40.243 --> 24:42.268
- Women are on the porch.
- Girls out there,

24:42.345 --> 24:45.371
guys in here.
Come on, Dan. Let's do it.

24:48.585 --> 24:52.749
Perfect! OK. The briefest time units.
Four letters.

24:52.822 --> 24:54.585
- Mili.
- Oh, wait.

24:54.657 --> 24:59.321
- Nano!
...A- N-O. Great!

24:59.395 --> 25:01.124
Hey, no spying.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.933
- You guys are way behind!
- That's not helping.

25:07.003 --> 25:09.631
Uh, I don't think "secretive" fits.

25:09.706 --> 25:12.072
No, it doesn't fit.
"Secretive" doesn't fit.

25:12.141 --> 25:14.405
<i>- Let's move on to 12 across.
- We're movin' on.</i>

25:14.477 --> 25:17.969
For you to be interested in someone,
she must be really special, right?

25:18.047 --> 25:20.277
<i>- Skip 12.
- This is what I'm trying to tell you.</i>

25:20.350 --> 25:23.945
It is not going to happen.
She is already dating somebody.

25:24.020 --> 25:27.581
- That's not your problem, bro.
- Actually, it kind of is.

25:27.657 --> 25:30.558
<i>Listen up, 15 across,
five letters, pan-fry.</i>

25:30.627 --> 25:32.993
- Pan-fry.
- Pan-fry. Uh, "grill." Uh...

25:33.062 --> 25:34.859
Dude, is there a rock on her left hand?

25:34.931 --> 25:37.092
- Uh, no, not yet.
- Then all's fair.

25:37.166 --> 25:40.465
All right, now focus, people!
Pan-fry!

25:40.536 --> 25:43.801
- Saute.
- Oh, my gosh. Of course it's saute!

25:46.442 --> 25:50.469
And, uh, the word before,
did we try "zeitgeist"?

25:50.546 --> 25:54.073
- It would be E-l-T.
- I think it would make "ozone" work.

25:54.150 --> 25:59.144
Lord, we hit the mother lode!

26:01.557 --> 26:06.017
Ten letters. "Anything that
can go wrong, will." So...

26:06.095 --> 26:07.892
Earth to Dan.
We're still at across.

26:07.964 --> 26:11.127
- We're not even at down, Dan.
- We're dying here, buddy.

26:15.571 --> 26:17.505
- We're done.
- Hooray for the dishes.

26:17.573 --> 26:20.940
Congratulations, yeah.

26:22.345 --> 26:24.813
- Let's check it!
- What now, boys?

26:24.881 --> 26:26.678
Dishes, duh!

26:26.749 --> 26:29.183
What happened?
You were useless out there.

26:29.252 --> 26:30.310
Sorry, guys.

26:30.386 --> 26:32.183
Lay off him.
He's got a lot on his mind.

26:32.255 --> 26:34.621
- Saute.
- Dad, Mom.

26:34.691 --> 26:36.181
What do you think of?

26:36.259 --> 26:38.819
Well, Mitch, it's too soon to tell.

26:38.895 --> 26:43.127
That being said, she's
bright, lovely, adorable,

26:43.199 --> 26:48.535
and if you botch this up,
we'll keep her and get rid of you.

26:48.604 --> 26:50.902
Dan, honey,
you missed a spot.

26:52.308 --> 26:57.075
Seriously, dude.
That girl is smokin'. Amazing. Really.

26:57.146 --> 27:01.242
- What do you think of her?
- Um, she's great.

27:02.919 --> 27:04.648
Let me have a bite.

27:22.605 --> 27:24.766
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27:28.144 --> 27:30.578
- No, no! Let's go, Gus.
- All right.

27:30.646 --> 27:32.705
Can I show you where
we are on this map...

27:32.782 --> 27:35.080
- Oh, yes. Yes.
...here?

27:35.151 --> 27:39.247
Um, if I had known,
I would have never...

27:39.322 --> 27:42.780
- Not my brother's girlfriend.
- Uh, no, of course not.

27:42.859 --> 27:45.919
And, for the record,
I never called you a hottie.

27:45.995 --> 27:49.021
- Hey, we are... This is the bay.
- Oh!

27:49.098 --> 27:51.191
- And we're right there.
- I see.

27:51.267 --> 27:54.031
- So, what should we do?
- Um, it's kind of funny.

27:54.103 --> 27:55.866
Maybe we should
just tell everyone.

27:55.938 --> 27:58.202
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

27:58.274 --> 28:00.435
We didn't do anything wrong.
It was sweet...

28:00.510 --> 28:02.944
Good! You guys are
getting to know each other.

28:03.012 --> 28:05.242
Yeah. Just showing her
where we are on the map.

28:05.314 --> 28:07.544
Hey, Uncle Mitch,
you're not counting.

28:07.617 --> 28:12.611
OK, OK. Hey. I know what's
goin' on here with you two.

28:15.224 --> 28:18.022
You're not hiding.

28:18.094 --> 28:20.722
Go ahead. One!

28:20.797 --> 28:23.561
- Two! Go!
- OK.

28:23.633 --> 28:26.101
- All right. I'm...
- Three!

28:26.169 --> 28:28.399
Clay, I know you're
in that back closet.

28:28.471 --> 28:30.166
- Come on!
- Four!

28:30.239 --> 28:32.639
Do over! Do over!

28:32.708 --> 28:36.405
Five! Six!
I'm counting to 200.

28:36.479 --> 28:38.504
- I see you.
- Yes, we do.

28:38.581 --> 28:41.379
I'm gonna lay down
for this whole thing. Eight!

28:43.653 --> 28:45.314
- Mitch is a great guy.
- He is!

28:45.388 --> 28:47.549
He's fun and, uh, funny.

28:47.623 --> 28:51.423
Uncomplicated in a... in a
good way. Just what I need.

28:51.494 --> 28:53.519
- He's a great guy.
- Nine!

28:53.596 --> 28:56.929
See, I just ended this long,
messy relationship,

28:56.999 --> 29:00.298
and I joined this gym
and Mitch was there.

29:00.369 --> 29:02.303
He's a great guy.

29:02.371 --> 29:05.670
- You keep saying that.
- Well, because he is.

29:05.741 --> 29:07.675
Ten!

29:07.743 --> 29:09.677
<i>Eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15!</i>

29:09.745 --> 29:14.307
- So good luck... to all of us.
- OK.

29:18.688 --> 29:21.316
So a little bird told me
you're gonna be syndicated.

29:21.390 --> 29:24.951
Lilly. They're looking at a bunch of
columnists. It's a long shot at best.

29:25.027 --> 29:29.521
She's amazing. Name a place,
she's either lived there or visited.

29:29.599 --> 29:33.262
Tibet, Chile, Berlin
when there was the Wall.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.702
She's...

29:35.771 --> 29:39.366
Wait! Whoa, whoa, what'd I miss?

29:39.442 --> 29:42.843
- Well, Mitch certainly made out.
- Yep.

29:42.912 --> 29:45.244
And what about you?
Have you found anyone?

29:45.314 --> 29:47.839
- Dad, don't...
- Look, I know you always say

29:47.917 --> 29:53.321
that with Suzanne you won the lottery
and that to try again would feel greedy,

29:53.389 --> 29:57.223
but it's been four years.

29:57.293 --> 29:59.523
Can we just walk, please?

30:08.471 --> 30:11.599
I wanted to spare you.

30:11.674 --> 30:14.700
And I never smelt a thing!

30:14.777 --> 30:17.507
Somebody please pass the corn.

30:17.580 --> 30:19.844
- And that's how we met.
- I got it.

30:19.916 --> 30:21.543
- My version...
- No.

30:21.617 --> 30:24.017
- What's your sign?
- Scorpio, Libra rising.

30:24.086 --> 30:25.610
- Oh, my God, so am I.
- Really?

30:25.688 --> 30:27.019
Do you have any siblings?

30:27.089 --> 30:29.216
- No.
- Who wants corn? Any...

30:29.292 --> 30:33.786
Tell us something about yourself
few people know, not even Mitch.

30:35.364 --> 30:38.629
I am an, um... an accomplished

30:38.701 --> 30:41.932
- maker of pancakes.
- Talent show.

30:42.004 --> 30:45.030
- Talent show.
- What would your perfect day be?

30:45.107 --> 30:47.598
Mine would start with Annie,
and end with Annie...

30:47.677 --> 30:49.907
We're not asking you.
So you were saying?

30:49.979 --> 30:53.346
Uh, my perfect day would start
with going to a country

30:53.416 --> 30:56.476
where they speak a language
I don't know, new customs,

30:56.552 --> 30:59.419
someplace where I'm
completely out of my element.

30:59.488 --> 31:01.547
Welcome.
I think you've arrived.

31:02.959 --> 31:04.483
I want to say, the first time...

31:04.560 --> 31:07.120
The first time that I saw her...

31:07.196 --> 31:10.097
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
you don't have to shout.

31:10.166 --> 31:13.624
Well, I thought that I just died

31:13.703 --> 31:19.039
- because there's an angel in the room.
- Mmm. Thank you.

31:26.182 --> 31:28.047
Are you and Mitch in love?

31:28.117 --> 31:30.642
This corn is like an angel.

31:39.695 --> 31:43.529
- Let's design a tent tonight.
- Yeah! Big giant one!

31:43.599 --> 31:46.329
We can make it have ceilings!

32:03.919 --> 32:06.820
Dessert! Dessert.

32:06.889 --> 32:08.914
Oh, Danny, some of us are still eating.

32:08.991 --> 32:10.686
- It's getting late.
- No, it's not.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.729
I'm an only child too. This is
really overwhelming, isn't it?

32:13.796 --> 32:15.923
Have you ever
lived your perfect day?

32:15.998 --> 32:18.091
When does a boyfriend
become a lover?

32:18.167 --> 32:20.260
OK. OK, all right, all right.

32:20.336 --> 32:23.965
I think we can stop asking her
questions. Been grilling her all night.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.871
Does it feel like we're grilling you?

32:25.941 --> 32:28.671
- No. No, not at all.
- She's just being nice.

32:28.744 --> 32:33.010
- No. I love the questions.
- Oh, please.

32:33.082 --> 32:38.577
Mm. On behalf of my family,
I would like to apologize.

32:38.654 --> 32:41.316
None of Mitch's girlfriends
have ever been subjected

32:41.390 --> 32:44.086
- to such in-depth questioning.
- Dan does have a point.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.993
- Right? Not the body double.
- No.

32:47.063 --> 32:50.157
- What was her name? Oh, God!
- Not the Knicks City Dancer.

32:50.232 --> 32:53.724
Or the "massage therapist."

32:53.803 --> 32:57.432
None of the flight attendants from
every major and regional airline

32:57.506 --> 32:59.838
who've wheeled their carts
through this house.

32:59.909 --> 33:03.743
- OK, that's enough.
- What? Am I wrong? Come on.

33:07.116 --> 33:11.280
Wow, Dan. Thank you
for pointing that out.

33:11.353 --> 33:13.378
You're the smartest guy I know.

33:15.357 --> 33:19.020
He's right. It's Annie's turn
to ask me whatever...

33:20.262 --> 33:21.627
She prefers Marie.

33:23.232 --> 33:25.723
Ask me whatever you want,
Marie.

33:25.801 --> 33:29.134
- I don't have any questions.
- Oh, come on.

33:29.205 --> 33:35.075
Mitch said early on that if I'd forgive
him his past, he'd forgive me mine.

33:37.346 --> 33:39.007
Well, that's a stupid thing to do.

33:39.081 --> 33:41.413
- OK, into the family room.
- Hey, guys. You done?

33:41.484 --> 33:45.682
Kids, come on.
Into the family room.

33:50.459 --> 33:53.360
John, bring the pies, please.

33:59.335 --> 34:03.101
Not you. You'll be
doing the dishes alone.

34:08.310 --> 34:10.437
Six. Six letters.

34:10.513 --> 34:12.777
Yes, yes, yes!

34:16.652 --> 34:19.449
Good job. Good job.

34:19.522 --> 34:21.683
- Second word.
- Second word.

34:22.891 --> 34:24.655
- You, you!
- Hey.

34:26.094 --> 34:28.120
I'm sorry. I was way, way out of line.

34:28.197 --> 34:30.529
No, you're never out of line.
You're my brother.

34:30.599 --> 34:32.226
You'll understand when I tell...

34:32.301 --> 34:34.098
Nothing you can say would upset me.

34:34.170 --> 34:37.264
- Can I just say one thing?
...the bookstore...

34:37.339 --> 34:40.603
When you were talking
about my other girls,

34:40.676 --> 34:42.303
I realized something.

34:44.547 --> 34:48.608
What I feel for Marie
is different.

34:50.319 --> 34:54.346
You know that feeling in,
um... in your...

34:54.422 --> 34:55.754
- Heart.
- Yeah.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.883
- When your heart is just...
- Pounding.

34:57.960 --> 35:02.124
- Pounding. And...
- Like it's actually outside your ribs.

35:02.198 --> 35:04.598
- Yes.
- Exposed, vulnerable...

35:04.667 --> 35:06.464
- Yeah. It's...
- Wonderful and awful

35:06.535 --> 35:09.527
and heartsick and alive,
all at the same time.

35:09.605 --> 35:13.132
Yes. Yes. Yeah, what do you...
what do we call that?

35:13.209 --> 35:16.201
Uh, love.

35:20.616 --> 35:22.675
You always did have the words.

35:29.325 --> 35:32.294
- Stanford or Berkeley.
- Oh, those are great schools.

35:32.361 --> 35:35.387
- Maybe University of Washington.
- Huh.

35:35.464 --> 35:38.126
Or somewhere closer to home.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.571
Lil, you have trouble sleeping,
you know where to find me.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.631
Dad.

35:48.344 --> 35:51.245
Uncle Mitch, are you going in
for your good-night kiss?

35:51.313 --> 35:52.837
- You bet.
- Mom and Dad's old

35:52.915 --> 35:55.941
- "separate bedrooms till married" rule.
- Kinda high school.

35:56.018 --> 35:57.781
- I agree with that rule.
- Thank you.

35:57.853 --> 36:00.253
- You're welcome.
- Mitch, what're you doing?

36:00.322 --> 36:02.256
Marie brought some books,
but I thought

36:02.324 --> 36:04.417
she should read a real book
by a real writer.

36:04.493 --> 36:06.927
<i>- Oh, no, no, no. Not a good idea.
- Au contraire.</i>

36:06.996 --> 36:08.793
- Please don't.
- Best book I've read.

36:08.864 --> 36:11.196
- May be the only book you've ever read.
- Funny.

36:11.267 --> 36:13.667
- Be nice.
- If you can sign it, that'd be great.

36:13.736 --> 36:16.364
- That's first edition.
- It's the only edition, Mom.

36:16.438 --> 36:19.202
- Oh, now. Good night.
- Good night.

36:19.275 --> 36:21.971
Sleep tight.

36:22.044 --> 36:25.275
Um, I really wish you wouldn't.

36:26.615 --> 36:28.879
"Good luck"? That's it?

36:28.951 --> 36:30.543
OK, we can work with that.

36:31.987 --> 36:34.046
Hi.

36:41.497 --> 36:43.055
Good night.

36:56.645 --> 36:59.546
- Good morning.
- Hey.

36:59.615 --> 37:02.049
- Say, "Good morning."
- Morning.

37:02.117 --> 37:04.950
Yeah. Good.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.545
Have fun.

37:07.623 --> 37:09.921
Here you go, sweetheart.
There you go.

37:09.992 --> 37:14.258
Marie. Will you join us,
please, beautiful girl?

37:14.330 --> 37:15.627
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah, honey?

37:15.698 --> 37:17.666
- Mom, will you hit that music?
- Sure.

37:17.733 --> 37:19.792
You need this more than I do.
Here he comes.

37:22.171 --> 37:26.403
All right, Dan. Get on over here.
Here we go, boxer shuffle.

37:26.475 --> 37:30.138
And I wanna see those fists up.
Three, two, one.

37:30.212 --> 37:31.941
To the right!

37:32.014 --> 37:35.506
Get a good bounce.
Five, six, seven. Switch!

37:35.584 --> 37:39.145
Five, six, seven. Whoo!

37:39.221 --> 37:42.019
Four, five, six, seven.
Counting!

37:42.091 --> 37:46.027
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

37:46.095 --> 37:48.495
- You wanna take it, babe?
- You wha?

37:48.564 --> 37:50.498
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- OK.

37:50.566 --> 37:53.797
Salsa?

37:55.037 --> 37:56.971
The floor is yours, baby.

37:57.806 --> 37:59.797
And left, and one...

37:59.875 --> 38:03.072
OK, hold on, hold on, all right.
Dan. Dan gets to go up front.

38:03.145 --> 38:07.775
Beginners in the middle. Keep your eyes
on Marie. Doing good. Doing good.

38:07.850 --> 38:12.549
- One, two, three, four.
- Yeah!

38:16.158 --> 38:19.594
- Let's do the arm a little bit.
- All right.

38:20.496 --> 38:24.227
One, two, three, four.

38:24.299 --> 38:26.426
One, two.

38:37.179 --> 38:40.444
OK, everybody. Look, Marie,
what to do. Dan, what not to do.

38:40.516 --> 38:42.450
The other way.

38:42.518 --> 38:43.678
You were excellent.

38:43.752 --> 38:44.776
Thank you so much.

38:44.853 --> 38:46.753
- Oh, you're welcome.
- That's great.

38:48.624 --> 38:50.785
You always hate to start it,

38:50.859 --> 38:53.885
but then you feel
so great after...

38:59.368 --> 39:02.701
Wow. That's a good stretch.

39:05.574 --> 39:06.802
- Oh, yeah.
- Ready?

39:06.875 --> 39:10.470
Hey, maybe you'll try that
on me a little bit later.

39:13.282 --> 39:14.749
It's good.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.828
- Dad?
- Lilly, get your sisters

39:30.899 --> 39:33.561
and meet me in front. Now.

39:38.907 --> 39:41.068
Where are you going?
Can we come with you?

39:41.143 --> 39:42.508
Can we, can we, can we?

39:42.578 --> 39:47.777
My girls are looking for a little
quality alone time with their dad.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.375
But I promise we'll do it
another day. All right?

39:50.452 --> 39:52.545
Lil, come on.
Let's go. In the car.

39:53.322 --> 39:54.653
Girls, let's go.

39:54.723 --> 39:58.784
Dad, what is it? Nana's gonna
teach me how to knit.

39:58.861 --> 40:01.489
- Cara, let's go.
- No.

40:05.067 --> 40:07.501
OK. What are you waiting for?

40:07.569 --> 40:10.094
Come here.

40:10.172 --> 40:12.140
Right here. Right here!

40:12.207 --> 40:16.541
Oh. Oh, you're so heavy. I
don't know what I'm gonna do.

40:16.612 --> 40:19.376
All right. Ah! Oh!
I'm gonna fall down.

40:19.448 --> 40:21.643
I don't think I can do this.

40:28.857 --> 40:30.324
Wow.

40:33.962 --> 40:36.192
No, no, no.

40:36.265 --> 40:39.792
This used to be the place
with all the shells

40:39.868 --> 40:42.701
and the papier-mache shark.

40:42.771 --> 40:44.762
Remember you loved
the saltwater taffy?

40:44.840 --> 40:49.402
- When I was four.
- Yeah, but... OK.

40:49.478 --> 40:52.845
Stick with me, guys.
Oh, I have an idea! Bowling!

40:52.915 --> 40:54.746
- Yay!
- Bowling, bowling, bowling!

40:54.816 --> 40:55.805
Sounds good.

40:55.884 --> 40:59.183
Life is full of disappointment.

40:59.254 --> 41:01.188
Big and sometimes even bigger.

41:01.256 --> 41:03.656
So, what's it gonna be?

41:03.725 --> 41:07.217
The lighthouse or the
whaling museum? Your pick.

41:09.998 --> 41:13.161
- Do you know why we have lighthouses?
- Because they're neat?

41:13.235 --> 41:16.432
That's right. Yes.

41:16.505 --> 41:20.134
And also because they help
when it's dark out.

41:20.208 --> 41:22.870
They, uh, help keep boats safe

41:22.945 --> 41:25.607
and keep us from crashing
into the rocks.

41:25.681 --> 41:28.411
Because when you're out there

41:28.483 --> 41:32.749
and you're being tossed back and forth
by those big dark waves

41:32.821 --> 41:37.224
and you think that you'll
never feel land again

41:37.292 --> 41:40.455
and that you could just
split into a million pieces

41:40.529 --> 41:45.728
and sink down all
the way down... deep,

41:45.801 --> 41:49.897
it's the light
that keeps us on course.

41:49.972 --> 41:53.567
- It's the light...
- Dad, are you OK?

41:53.642 --> 41:57.976
'Course I'm OK... honey.

42:05.187 --> 42:07.018
- Did you guys have fun?
- No.

42:07.089 --> 42:08.613
No.

42:10.425 --> 42:13.519
- Jump inside. Let's go, honey.
- Kids? Where've you been?

42:13.595 --> 42:16.689
- I know. I know. I'm...
- Oh, we looked all over.

42:16.765 --> 42:19.791
- For an expert on parenting...
- I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

42:19.868 --> 42:22.666
Hi, buddy. Hi.

42:22.738 --> 42:26.572
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, buddy.

42:28.143 --> 42:30.304
I got it.

42:32.714 --> 42:35.012
Dan. She was amazing.
You should've seen her.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.983
She killed the last quarter mile.

42:37.052 --> 42:40.954
- I was fast. Wasn't I?
- Yeah, it was like I couldn't catch up.

42:41.023 --> 42:42.820
Even your sweat is beautiful.

42:46.194 --> 42:47.593
Where'd Dan go?

42:47.663 --> 42:51.224
Mom, she moves like
a goddess out there.

42:51.299 --> 42:53.563
- Yeah?
- She's like a panther.

42:53.635 --> 42:55.728
You know, just her body...

42:55.804 --> 42:59.137
She's competitive, but I just wanted
to pounce. You know what I mean?

42:59.207 --> 43:01.437
I wanted to ride her up the beach.
She was...

43:01.510 --> 43:04.445
- Don't do that.
- She was like my stallion.

43:08.750 --> 43:11.241
I wanted her to be in front of me.
You know what I mean?

43:11.319 --> 43:16.780
Marie. There's fresh towels up
there in the cabinet to the right.

43:16.858 --> 43:20.419
I miss your skin.

43:20.495 --> 43:22.895
I miss your smell.

43:22.964 --> 43:25.956
Mm. I miss...

43:26.034 --> 43:29.060
I miss your eyes.

43:29.137 --> 43:32.402
- Dad!
- I...

43:32.474 --> 43:34.066
- You're such a freak!
- I...

43:34.142 --> 43:36.838
No, sorry. That was
just my loser of a father!

43:36.912 --> 43:39.506
Yeah, he was totally spying.

43:46.054 --> 43:49.023
- Hello? Hello?
- We gotta talk.

43:50.659 --> 43:53.389
- Can it wait?
- Is this working for you?

43:53.462 --> 43:55.953
I mean, really working. Be honest.

43:56.031 --> 43:58.431
- I'm having a nice time.
- A nice time?

43:58.500 --> 44:00.968
- Yes, I am.
- Really? So you're enjoying yourself?

44:01.036 --> 44:03.095
- Except for the soap in my eyes.
- OK.

44:03.171 --> 44:05.969
'Cause you know what? I'm not.
I'm not enjoying myself,

44:06.041 --> 44:08.839
and I think that,
as two people of principle,

44:08.910 --> 44:10.844
we should have
ground rules. Don't you?

44:10.912 --> 44:15.611
Oh, yeah, sure. OK, sure.

44:15.684 --> 44:17.276
Oh. OK! All right, that's...

44:17.352 --> 44:19.377
That's what I'm
talking about. No, no, no.

44:19.454 --> 44:21.718
We need to keep our distance.
Stop. Stay away.

44:21.790 --> 44:24.384
- Towel.
- Stop. OK. I'm sorry.

44:24.459 --> 44:25.983
Thank you.

44:26.061 --> 44:29.121
And, you know, stop reading
my book. OK, just stop.

44:29.197 --> 44:33.031
- Why?
- And that salsa thing you do...

44:33.101 --> 44:35.399
- What are you talking about?
- The salsa dance.

44:35.470 --> 44:38.598
This... This thing.
If you could just not do that.

44:38.673 --> 44:41.665
- I'm sorry.
- If you stop doing that as a rule,

44:41.743 --> 44:43.370
it would be very helpful to me.

44:43.445 --> 44:45.936
There are other things you
can do, such as not exist.

44:46.014 --> 44:47.948
- Oh. Thank you.
- That... not... Yeah!

44:48.016 --> 44:51.315
I said it. I said it.
I didn't mean it, but I said it.

44:51.386 --> 44:53.513
- And you know what else I'm gonna do?
- What?

44:53.588 --> 44:57.319
I am going to make myself
less attractive,

44:57.392 --> 44:59.883
so as to not encourage
any inappropriate feelings.

45:01.696 --> 45:04.893
OK, that's hilarious.
But you know what? I... No.

45:04.966 --> 45:07.560
- I'm gonna stop thinking about you.
- Good.

45:07.636 --> 45:09.365
I will.

45:09.437 --> 45:12.838
And if I start
thinking about you,

45:12.908 --> 45:15.206
- which may happen in a moment of...
- Weakness.

45:15.277 --> 45:19.543
...weakness, I'm going to focus all
of my thoughts on your flaws.

45:19.614 --> 45:21.241
- My flaws.
- Your flaws.

45:21.316 --> 45:23.284
- And they are?
- I have no idea,

45:23.351 --> 45:26.320
but you can rest assured
that I am going to find...

45:26.388 --> 45:27.548
Just ask Nana. Oh!

45:27.622 --> 45:29.419
I'm so sorry.
Are you taking a shower?

45:29.491 --> 45:30.890
Yes. I'm taking a shower.

45:30.959 --> 45:33.928
Oh, well, a little advice.
Old houses, old pipes.

45:33.995 --> 45:36.327
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Takes forever to heat up.

45:36.398 --> 45:39.697
Um, can I talk
to you about something?

45:39.768 --> 45:44.205
- Sure. Absolutely.
- And can we just keep it between us?

45:44.272 --> 45:47.833
It's just... It was... Um...

45:47.909 --> 45:49.740
See, last night what I was...

45:49.811 --> 45:52.974
You were talking
about your life last night.

45:53.048 --> 45:57.246
The importance of travel and of,
um, trying new things, you know,

45:57.319 --> 46:01.517
and I just started
thinking about... Amazing! Um...

46:01.590 --> 46:04.218
All of that, you know,
how much...

46:04.292 --> 46:08.820
- That looks like it's ready.
- Right.

46:08.897 --> 46:12.458
Um... But just...

46:12.534 --> 46:14.502
Oh, you're...
You're still dressed.

46:14.569 --> 46:17.367
Oh, I forgot.

46:17.439 --> 46:19.566
I'll look away.
I'll look over here.

46:19.641 --> 46:24.340
Anyway, so, I just realized,
you know, really, um...

46:26.147 --> 46:30.049
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about what I wanna do, um,

46:30.118 --> 46:32.916
you know, in the future, like
not just for school, but...

46:32.988 --> 46:36.287
It's just hard to figure out exactly
what I wanna do with my life.

46:36.358 --> 46:39.691
I mean, I know I wanna go
somewhere new and, you know,

46:39.761 --> 46:41.786
try new things, um...

46:41.863 --> 46:44.661
I mean it's just hard
to figure out, you know,

46:44.733 --> 46:47.224
- your place, like where you should be.
- Right.

46:47.302 --> 46:50.465
And just to have that experience,
you know, and to...

46:50.538 --> 46:55.134
Which is, you know,
what it's all about. You know?

46:55.210 --> 46:58.179
- Right.
- But it's also, I mean,

46:58.246 --> 47:00.942
it's also... I mean,
it's also terrifying realizing

47:01.016 --> 47:05.419
what you want is what you want.
You know what I mean?

47:05.487 --> 47:09.924
You know, I think
it's so interesting not...

47:09.991 --> 47:13.984
Interesting the way that,
um, you end up somewhere

47:14.062 --> 47:17.930
other than where you, um...

47:29.544 --> 47:30.875
Oh!

47:36.351 --> 47:37.716
Lunch!

47:41.623 --> 47:44.114
Mac and cheese. Nothing better.

47:44.192 --> 47:46.422
Adults are in the dining room.

47:46.494 --> 47:51.557
You know, I think I'm going to
mix it up and sit with my peeps.

47:51.633 --> 47:55.535
- Dan. Honey...
- Mom, please. Just let me be.

48:04.479 --> 48:06.071
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Uncle Dan.

48:06.147 --> 48:08.308
- Hey.
- Hi, Uncle Dan.

48:33.041 --> 48:34.065
Hello?

48:46.721 --> 48:48.848
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:48.923 --> 48:51.721
- What's going on?
- Marie's helping me with something.

48:51.793 --> 48:56.253
- We're having no fun at all.
- Yeah, I can see that.

48:56.331 --> 48:59.198
- How's she doing?
- She's amazing.

48:59.267 --> 49:02.293
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

49:02.370 --> 49:04.736
- Bye.
- Bye.

49:06.508 --> 49:08.942
- So you were saying...
- Oh, yeah.

49:09.010 --> 49:11.877
And I was trying to,
um, make, like, you know...

49:11.946 --> 49:13.914
I was trying to make
like a really heart.

49:13.982 --> 49:17.543
But, you know, I didn't even know how
to even draw a heart. So I cut it.

49:17.619 --> 49:19.314
- Uh-huh.
- And it came out, like,

49:19.387 --> 49:24.723
it was so... it came out
like a... like a star.

49:24.793 --> 49:24.893
Yeah.

49:24.893 --> 49:26.724
Yeah.

49:26.795 --> 49:29.025
- Dan? Hi.
- Hmm. Hey.

49:29.097 --> 49:32.498
Uh. Honey, you know we're worried
about you. You know that.

49:32.567 --> 49:36.196
And with your behavior last
night and this morning,

49:36.271 --> 49:38.865
we are now officially worried.

49:38.940 --> 49:44.105
Well, thanks, I'm touched.
But I'm fine. You don't...

49:44.179 --> 49:47.444
- We're having a private conversation.
- Come on in.

49:47.515 --> 49:49.278
No, come on in.
This is good.

49:49.350 --> 49:52.444
Mom, go ahead,
I'm all ears.

49:52.520 --> 49:57.184
Look, you know,
you do so much for your girls.

49:57.258 --> 50:01.024
And you do so much for all of us.
What are you doing for yourself?

50:01.096 --> 50:02.723
Not now.

50:02.797 --> 50:04.856
- Come on in.
- Think about...

50:04.933 --> 50:06.924
- We're trying to have a talk.
- It's fine.

50:07.001 --> 50:09.162
- We'd like to speak to you privately.
- Stay.

50:09.237 --> 50:10.864
- Go ahead, Mom.
- Yes, honey.

50:10.939 --> 50:13.464
- Is it 'cause Uncle Dan's acting weird?
- Yes, it is.

50:13.541 --> 50:15.736
There's an explanation for it.

50:15.810 --> 50:18.472
- Please tell us.
- I just wanted to talk to you.

50:18.546 --> 50:20.810
Dude, you got to be way backed up.

50:20.882 --> 50:24.784
So I just hope from time to time you are
treating yourself to a little self-love.

50:24.853 --> 50:27.344
- Oh, come on.
- I talked to my urologist about this.

50:27.422 --> 50:29.083
- That's enough. Come on.
- Sorry.

50:29.157 --> 50:31.284
What are you talking about, man?

50:31.359 --> 50:33.725
The real question,
the one no one will ask,

50:33.795 --> 50:37.424
- is will Dan ever find love again?
- No, he won't.

50:37.499 --> 50:40.468
- Howard.
- I'm sorry, he won't.

50:40.535 --> 50:42.127
I'm saying, one of the things,

50:42.203 --> 50:44.194
if you're open to it,
love will find you.

50:44.272 --> 50:45.933
- Oh.
- I suppose.

50:46.007 --> 50:48.373
- Hey, people.
- And... perfect.

50:48.443 --> 50:51.537
I don't think I was being clear before

50:51.613 --> 50:54.047
- but you got to unclog that drain.
- Uh-huh.

50:54.115 --> 50:57.346
You gotta unplug that bottle.
If I mixed a metaphor there.

50:57.418 --> 50:59.409
- Yes, you did.
- So far what you've missed

50:59.487 --> 51:04.857
is, uh, "worried," "love will find,"
"unclog the drain."

51:04.926 --> 51:07.793
Well, thanks. That is it.

51:07.862 --> 51:09.523
- No. That's not it.
- We are done.

51:09.597 --> 51:12.191
You can all...
Oh, come on, Ma.

51:12.267 --> 51:16.328
We met Margot Draper's daughter
at the farmers' market.

51:16.404 --> 51:18.497
- Who?
- And she asked all about you.

51:18.573 --> 51:21.542
You see, Danny, you gotta,
you know, have a little fun.

51:21.609 --> 51:25.875
Which means that Ruthie Draper
is gonna pick you up at 6:00,

51:25.947 --> 51:29.075
- and you're gonna have drinks!
- I don't even remember Ruthie...

51:29.150 --> 51:30.845
- You're gonna go on a date!
- No, no.

51:30.919 --> 51:32.978
No, I'm not going on a date, Mom.

51:33.054 --> 51:35.318
Yes, honey, it's time.

51:35.390 --> 51:39.326
Ruthie "Pigface" Draper. Mom,
Dad, what, are you kidding?

51:39.394 --> 51:42.989
Not "Pigface" Draper. I'm sorry,
that is downright cruel.

51:43.064 --> 51:44.656
There's nothing cruel about it.

51:44.732 --> 51:48.031
Mom, I don't even remember
Ruthie "Pigfaced" Draper.

51:48.102 --> 51:52.801
I don't wanna go! I don't
want to go with the pig face.

51:52.874 --> 51:55.172
- He's going. It's been decided!
- No, I'm not.

51:55.243 --> 51:59.179
- I don't remember "Pigface" Draper.
- This is a blind date.

51:59.247 --> 52:03.081
We'll double. OK? It'll be fun,
it'll be fun. Right, Marie?

52:03.151 --> 52:05.642
Yes, it'll be fun. Yes.

52:08.723 --> 52:10.486
That's my girl.

52:12.193 --> 52:13.956
Come on, it'll be swine... fine.

52:14.028 --> 52:16.622
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

52:16.698 --> 52:18.928
Go hog-wild.

52:41.789 --> 52:43.620
All right. All right.

53:30.238 --> 53:32.297
All right. All right.

53:32.373 --> 53:34.500
Here we go.

53:58.833 --> 54:00.858
That's very good.

54:04.372 --> 54:06.966
It's really... it's beauti...
Hello! Hi.

54:07.041 --> 54:09.908
Hi. Everybody, this is Ruthie Draper.

54:09.977 --> 54:13.743
- You know everybody. They're bigger.
- Yes. Hi, everyone.

54:13.815 --> 54:16.215
- Nice to see you again, Ruthie.
- Hello, Dan.

54:16.284 --> 54:19.151
- Hi.
- I'd know you anywhere.

54:19.220 --> 54:21.711
I mean,
you look just the same.

54:21.789 --> 54:27.318
Ruthie, um, you look great.

54:27.395 --> 54:29.989
Funny.

54:30.064 --> 54:33.295
- No, no, no, don't...
- So, Harvard Medical,

54:33.368 --> 54:36.269
Johns Hopkins... You're doing well
for yourself, Ruthie.

54:36.337 --> 54:38.464
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's impressive.

54:38.539 --> 54:41.474
It must not, uh, leave enough time
though for... for dating?

54:41.542 --> 54:44.204
Uh, there was someone.

54:44.278 --> 54:48.146
He was very special in my life,
but, uh...

54:50.184 --> 54:53.813
He was lost in
a freak accident.

54:53.888 --> 54:55.981
I'm so sorry.

54:57.492 --> 54:59.426
Thank you.

54:59.494 --> 55:03.658
What's weird is that we'd only
known each other three days,

55:03.731 --> 55:08.031
but it's... you know how
sometimes you just know.

55:08.102 --> 55:11.299
- Yes.
- Yeah. Yes, absolutely, yes.

55:11.372 --> 55:14.000
- Um, yeah.
- So you're a doctor?

55:14.075 --> 55:18.136
- Yes, yes.
- What's your, uh, specialty?

55:18.212 --> 55:21.511
- Um, I'm a plastic surgeon.
- Oh, of course you are.

55:21.582 --> 55:24.915
No, I know, I know,
I know what you're thinking.

55:24.986 --> 55:27.978
But I work exclusively with
burn victims, with children

55:28.055 --> 55:30.182
- born with facial deformities.
- Oh.

55:30.258 --> 55:33.921
- She is basically a saint.
- No. No, I'm just...

55:33.995 --> 55:39.729
I'm just doing my little bit to help,
I think. Just like your brother.

55:39.801 --> 55:43.532
- Oh, stop. I'm...
- When I can't sleep at night,

55:43.604 --> 55:48.667
I go online and I read your
past columns. Have you read Dan?

55:48.743 --> 55:50.904
Only his fiction.

55:50.978 --> 55:53.469
You're in for such a treat, really.

55:53.548 --> 55:58.485
I mean, what... what you said,
the mother of Couch Potato?

55:58.553 --> 56:00.214
- Mm-hmm.
- "Hide the remote.

56:00.288 --> 56:03.883
So, what if he has to get up and change
the channel? At least it's exercise."

56:03.958 --> 56:07.553
It's brilliant. And then... and the
parents of the five picky eaters?

56:07.628 --> 56:11.496
They had to make individual
meals for each kid and...

56:11.566 --> 56:13.466
"What are you, a restaurant?"

56:13.534 --> 56:14.899
- Right.
- Brilliant.

56:14.969 --> 56:17.836
- She used your every word.
- All I'm saying, all I'm saying

56:17.905 --> 56:21.966
is that I don't have kids. And I
don't, I don't have problems,

56:22.043 --> 56:26.412
but it's clear that
if I do one day,

56:26.481 --> 56:28.745
your words will bring me comfort.

56:39.393 --> 56:43.989
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna have
to excuse myself. I can't help it.

56:56.777 --> 56:58.870
I'm sorry. But a girl
that moves like that,

56:58.946 --> 57:02.177
I mean...
...a guy has got to wonder.

57:02.250 --> 57:03.615
Hey, man.

57:03.684 --> 57:08.451
- She's cool. Marie, you're cool, right?
- Yeah. Of course. I'm cool.

57:08.523 --> 57:10.548
But I don't think Dan
is interested in her.

57:10.625 --> 57:14.356
- He's not?
- I'm not?

57:14.428 --> 57:17.397
I don't think you are. Are you?

57:27.174 --> 57:31.975
Oh, nice.
All right. Yeah!

57:34.148 --> 57:37.379
I don't know what it was,
but something was holding him back.

57:37.451 --> 57:39.476
Not anymore.

57:39.554 --> 57:42.250
Well, that's a beautiful thing.

58:05.713 --> 58:07.271
We're coming.

58:55.162 --> 58:58.996
All right. OK.
Home again, home again.

58:59.066 --> 59:01.660
- I really love your car.
- Oh, thank you.

59:01.736 --> 59:02.930
- Bye.
- Bye.

59:03.004 --> 59:05.472
Nice meeting you, um, Ruth.

59:05.539 --> 59:07.404
- Yeah, you too.
- Come on, guys.

59:07.475 --> 59:11.343
Actually, um, Dan and I are
gonna go for a little drive.

59:11.412 --> 59:12.538
Don't wait up.

59:14.782 --> 59:16.181
Oh.

59:28.326 --> 59:30.627
Mmm, this is fantastic.

59:30.628 --> 59:34.928
I know what the secret
ingredient is... love. Mmm.

59:34.999 --> 59:36.694
Better and better with every bite.

59:36.768 --> 59:39.669
- Words cannot describe.
- Mmm, thank you.

59:39.737 --> 59:42.137
- Well, how are they?
- Dad, they're scrumptious.

59:42.206 --> 59:45.141
Mm-hmm. Truly mouthwatering.

59:45.209 --> 59:47.234
- Almost on my third stack.
- More, please.

59:47.312 --> 59:49.906
- And nothing's stopping you, right?
- Nope.

59:49.981 --> 59:53.382
It's a secret recipe,
but she let me crack the eggs.

59:53.451 --> 59:55.009
Yeah?

59:55.086 --> 59:57.418
So, uh, how's Captain Lucky
doing this morning?

59:57.488 --> 59:59.513
- Oh. Uh, it was fun.
- Yeah?

59:59.591 --> 01:00:02.151
Heard you worked up quite
the appetite last night.

01:00:02.226 --> 01:00:03.887
Yeah.

01:00:03.962 --> 01:00:06.396
- Could I have one more there?
- There you go.

01:00:06.464 --> 01:00:09.262
You know what? Actually,
I am a little hungry.

01:00:09.334 --> 01:00:12.098
- Secret recipe. Right here.
- Boy, these are good.

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.832
- I love them.
- Thank you.

01:00:14.906 --> 01:00:18.706
- How many have you had, Dad?
- So did you uncork?

01:00:20.345 --> 01:00:23.075
Whatever did or did not happen,
no one deserves someone

01:00:23.147 --> 01:00:24.409
more than you.

01:00:24.482 --> 01:00:27.110
There you go.

01:00:27.185 --> 01:00:31.485
- Coin toss. Outside.
- Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

01:00:34.459 --> 01:00:36.086
Yummy.

01:01:00.752 --> 01:01:02.515
All right. Nice!

01:01:02.587 --> 01:01:05.886
Yeah? You're gonna do that?
That what you're gonna do?

01:01:05.957 --> 01:01:08.687
Is that how we're gonna play it?
Yeah! OK.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.627
All right. Yeah, so you wanna
take out my knees, huh?

01:01:11.696 --> 01:01:14.164
Come again.

01:01:14.232 --> 01:01:16.291
Line up, I need coverage over here.

01:01:29.714 --> 01:01:32.649
- Line up! Line up! Here we go!
- All right, bring it back.

01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:39.412
- Hike!
- Hey, pork chop!

01:01:41.759 --> 01:01:43.920
- Marie! Marie!
- Go, Marie!

01:01:59.477 --> 01:02:02.571
Danny!

01:02:04.882 --> 01:02:08.147
<i>Why you persist in acting like
a 15- year-old is beyond me.</i>

01:02:08.219 --> 01:02:09.846
I'm filled with reckless desire.

01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:12.185
You ought to be filled
with greater restraint.

01:02:12.256 --> 01:02:14.952
- What does that mean?
- I think you know what that means.

01:02:20.098 --> 01:02:22.123
- Dad, could you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.462
Thanks.

01:02:24.402 --> 01:02:27.838
Hello? No, I'm his dad.

01:02:27.905 --> 01:02:31.033
Someone named
Jordy for you.

01:02:34.645 --> 01:02:39.673
Everybody! Everybody!
Dan just got a phone call.

01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:42.948
And you know, syndication is
everything for a columnist.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.510
OK, all right. Let me explain.

01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:48.218
Um, I've been asked to meet

01:02:48.292 --> 01:02:50.760
with the head mucky-mucks

01:02:50.828 --> 01:02:53.524
of the Lamson Newspaper Group.

01:02:53.598 --> 01:02:55.862
They're driving down tomorrow

01:02:55.933 --> 01:02:59.061
and they are going
to sit down with me.

01:02:59.137 --> 01:03:02.595
That's great!

01:03:02.673 --> 01:03:06.200
- Maybe you should get the job first.
- Yes, that's true.

01:03:08.212 --> 01:03:09.804
- Dan the man.
- Thanks, man.

01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:14.811
Well?

01:03:16.821 --> 01:03:19.119
Wow.

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:20.452
Wow!

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.425
Dad?

01:03:24.495 --> 01:03:28.591
Dad? Lilly just asked me why
you were flirting with Marie.

01:03:31.002 --> 01:03:34.438
- I wasn't flirting.
- Don't worry, I covered for you.

01:03:34.505 --> 01:03:37.872
- I told her it was nothing.
- Because it was.

01:03:37.942 --> 01:03:43.073
<i>Dad, I'm 17.
OK? You were so flirting.</i>

01:03:43.147 --> 01:03:45.707
You know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

01:03:45.783 --> 01:03:49.048
It's not like she's the
least bit interested in you.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.317
But cool it, OK?

01:03:57.762 --> 01:04:00.663
- And, um, congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:04:43.741 --> 01:04:48.940
Look, he took a bus here.
He has relatives in Boston. Dad...

01:04:49.013 --> 01:04:50.981
Dad, he loves me!

01:04:51.048 --> 01:04:53.676
OK.

01:04:53.751 --> 01:04:56.242
You don't have to worry.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.518
When it comes to sex,
Marty is the one who wants to wait.

01:05:00.591 --> 01:05:04.755
What about that sentence is
supposed to give me comfort?

01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:06.626
- Dad, I love him.
- Honey...

01:05:06.697 --> 01:05:08.130
I love him.

01:05:08.199 --> 01:05:11.862
- I love him. I love him.
- No, you don't.

01:05:11.936 --> 01:05:14.666
What we have is true love.

01:05:14.739 --> 01:05:16.730
And just because you don't have it,

01:05:16.807 --> 01:05:19.605
doesn't mean you have to punish us.

01:05:19.677 --> 01:05:24.171
Infatuation is not love.
Sexual attraction is not love.

01:05:24.248 --> 01:05:26.910
- You don't understand.
- Uh, I don't understand.

01:05:26.984 --> 01:05:29.851
No, you don't even understand
that you don't understand.

01:05:29.921 --> 01:05:33.288
What don't I understand, Cara?
Please, help me out.

01:05:33.357 --> 01:05:36.520
What is it? It's frustrating that you
can't be with this person?

01:05:36.594 --> 01:05:39.085
That... that there's
something keeping you apart,

01:05:39.163 --> 01:05:41.529
something about this
person you connect with?

01:05:41.599 --> 01:05:43.863
And whenever you're
near this person,

01:05:43.935 --> 01:05:46.335
you don't know what to say,
and you say everything

01:05:46.404 --> 01:05:48.235
that's in your mind
and in your heart.

01:05:48.306 --> 01:05:50.866
And you know that if you
could just be together,

01:05:50.942 --> 01:05:54.708
that this person will help you become
the best possible version of yourself.

01:05:54.779 --> 01:05:57.111
So Marty can stay?

01:06:02.987 --> 01:06:04.784
I'm sorry.

01:06:07.892 --> 01:06:10.486
I'm sorry.

01:06:16.467 --> 01:06:18.958
"Marty can stay?"

01:06:19.737 --> 01:06:21.671
Howard is going
to drive you to the bus.

01:06:21.739 --> 01:06:23.969
We called your aunt,
she's waiting in Boston.

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.100
- Yes, sir.
- Look, I'm not your parent,

01:06:26.177 --> 01:06:28.907
but I think you should know,
love is a dangerous feeling.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.073
- No, sir.
- Are you arguing with me?

01:06:31.148 --> 01:06:34.515
No, I'm... It's just...

01:06:38.923 --> 01:06:41.414
Love is not a feeling,
it's an ability.

01:06:41.492 --> 01:06:45.519
- Who told you that?
- Made it up, Mr. Burns.

01:06:50.668 --> 01:06:52.295
Come say goodbye.

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.841
Window. OK, that's it.

01:06:58.909 --> 01:07:01.707
- Dad.
- She'll see him again soon enough.

01:07:04.615 --> 01:07:07.743
No! No!

01:07:07.818 --> 01:07:11.845
No! Marty! Marty! Marty!

01:07:14.392 --> 01:07:16.690
- That's sweet.
- What's sweet?

01:07:16.761 --> 01:07:18.626
How... How is that sweet?

01:07:18.696 --> 01:07:21.722
It's OK. It's OK.
Come on, it's OK.

01:07:21.799 --> 01:07:25.098
To be that certain.
To feel so much love.

01:07:26.704 --> 01:07:30.071
- Love isn't a feeling.
- No?

01:07:31.876 --> 01:07:33.935
It's an ability.

01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:41.417
Well, if that's true,
you have one gifted daughter.

01:07:43.621 --> 01:07:48.581
You are a murderer of love!

01:07:54.832 --> 01:07:55.999
OK, Cara. Next?

01:07:57.234 --> 01:07:59.668
Uh, Olivia has something
with the girls.

01:07:59.737 --> 01:08:03.537
Gus will be doing his usual.
Bella is on the fence.

01:08:03.607 --> 01:08:07.407
- Howard and I will sing.
- Oh, that's nice. Aunt Eileen?

01:08:07.478 --> 01:08:09.742
- Put me down.
- Oh, really? What's your talent?

01:08:09.814 --> 01:08:13.011
Murderer of love.

01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:14.142
You were saying?

01:08:14.218 --> 01:08:16.845
We have something planned
for the whole family.

01:08:16.921 --> 01:08:18.319
Put us all down.

01:08:31.902 --> 01:08:35.861
- What's your Dad's talent?
- Doesn't have one.

01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:39.033
He's the only one excused
from participating.

01:08:40.176 --> 01:08:41.701
I give you Bella Wilson.

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:44.212
All right, Bella!

01:08:44.281 --> 01:08:46.511
Chihuahua.

01:08:49.553 --> 01:08:51.180
- Go, Bella.
- You OK?

01:08:51.255 --> 01:08:53.883
- I don't have a good feeling.
- Do what you always do.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:57.359
Marie is not a lip-sync kinda girl.

01:08:57.428 --> 01:09:01.421
- I gotta do something special.
- Just... be yourself.

01:09:01.499 --> 01:09:05.265
Bulldog.

01:09:05.336 --> 01:09:09.898
Ruff! Ruff!

01:09:11.742 --> 01:09:14.904
That's...

01:09:21.318 --> 01:09:24.185
- This is for Marty.
- Want me to take the cherries?

01:09:24.255 --> 01:09:27.224
- Mm. Uh-uh.
- OK.

01:09:45.876 --> 01:09:48.640
Wow!

01:09:48.712 --> 01:09:49.804
She tied it!

01:10:14.538 --> 01:10:17.974
- I got an idea.
- I'm sure it'll be great.

01:10:18.042 --> 01:10:20.169
It could be.

01:10:25.082 --> 01:10:28.483
OK, last but not least,
Uncle Mitch.

01:10:28.552 --> 01:10:32.488
Uh, someone very wise,
uh, my brother,

01:10:32.556 --> 01:10:35.150
once told me that if you

01:10:35.226 --> 01:10:38.821
want to be
completely honest, sing.

01:10:40.297 --> 01:10:42.993
Um, by the way, I'd
like to introduce my band.

01:10:44.435 --> 01:10:48.098
I don't believe it.
He hasn't played since she...

01:10:48.172 --> 01:10:50.333
One, two, three, four.

01:12:02.446 --> 01:12:03.970
Ah!

01:12:29.273 --> 01:12:31.400
Yeah, Uncle Mitch!

01:13:10.848 --> 01:13:14.215
What he said.

01:13:23.994 --> 01:13:26.155
Great job, guys.

01:13:35.272 --> 01:13:37.365
What was that?

01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:40.706
I couldn't...
I couldn't stop myself.

01:13:40.778 --> 01:13:43.679
What am I supposed to do now?

01:13:43.747 --> 01:13:46.545
You can't do anything.
He's my brother.

01:13:46.617 --> 01:13:49.745
Why did you sing for me... then?

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:54.189
Because I... I'm...

01:13:58.729 --> 01:14:00.629
<i>Page 92. "Did I just die?</i>

01:14:00.697 --> 01:14:02.858
Because an angel walked
into the room."

01:14:02.933 --> 01:14:08.166
<i>Page 148. Uh, "I'll forgive you your
past if you'll forgive me mine."</i>

01:14:08.238 --> 01:14:10.638
It seems all his
best lines were yours.

01:14:14.611 --> 01:14:18.809
It's unbearable. I...

01:14:18.882 --> 01:14:20.850
I can't keep pretending.

01:14:24.988 --> 01:14:26.683
St...

01:14:36.567 --> 01:14:40.128
- Dad?
- Yeah, peanut.

01:14:40.204 --> 01:14:43.662
Will you come up to my room?
I wanna show you something I made.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.141
Um, we'll do it tomorrow.
OK, sweetie? I promise.

01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:51.338
OK, Dad.

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.118
Oh, God!

01:15:05.362 --> 01:15:08.092
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shh.

01:15:10.934 --> 01:15:14.131
What is complicated being here?
My singing.

01:15:14.204 --> 01:15:16.195
- I shouldn't have sang.
- I know this.

01:15:16.273 --> 01:15:17.797
No. It's not...

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:22.778
- It was a bad song. I...
- Is she crying or laughing?

01:15:26.617 --> 01:15:30.849
- Oh, no, no, no. Please.
- Please don't do it.

01:15:30.921 --> 01:15:34.118
Marie...

01:15:44.067 --> 01:15:45.898
Here he comes.

01:15:45.969 --> 01:15:47.994
Mom!

01:15:48.071 --> 01:15:52.098
Uh, no, no, no, no. I don't know what
to say to him. I never lost a girl.

01:15:52.175 --> 01:15:55.235
- Oh, good. This is a first.
- Wow.

01:15:55.312 --> 01:15:58.577
OK. Oh, uh, oh, yeah,
I'll follow through with these.

01:16:02.753 --> 01:16:04.914
Please stop trying to act normal.

01:16:13.597 --> 01:16:16.157
Said I was a great guy.

01:16:16.233 --> 01:16:19.430
She said she loved me a lot.

01:16:19.503 --> 01:16:22.961
And then she said...

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.838
...we should both go find
our own true soul mates.

01:16:25.909 --> 01:16:28.400
I'm so confused. I don't
really know what happened

01:16:28.478 --> 01:16:31.936
from yesterday to today
that made this happen.

01:16:32.015 --> 01:16:35.610
There has to be something.
You know, some reason she...

01:16:35.686 --> 01:16:38.678
- Why are you looking at me?
- Not looking at you.

01:16:38.755 --> 01:16:42.919
He's looking into the vast void that is
his future. You just happen to be there.

01:16:42.993 --> 01:16:45.791
Danny, do you have anything to add?

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:48.228
Yeah, what does the expert
have to say? Come on.

01:16:48.298 --> 01:16:52.234
- Uh...
- Honey, the hard truth is

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:54.270
we all liked her a lot.

01:16:54.338 --> 01:16:59.173
Yeah, we really did.

01:16:59.242 --> 01:17:02.075
This isn't helping. No.

01:17:02.145 --> 01:17:05.774
Could somebody think
of something fun to do?

01:17:05.849 --> 01:17:08.249
OK, OK, um... OK, OK.

01:17:08.318 --> 01:17:10.548
Part of the Rat Pack!
Singer. Um, um...

01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:14.387
Dean Martin! Sammy Davis, Jr!

01:17:15.692 --> 01:17:17.990
Yes!

01:17:18.061 --> 01:17:20.222
Your turn, buddy.
Come on. Let's do it.

01:17:22.833 --> 01:17:24.767
OK.

01:17:24.835 --> 01:17:26.234
Go!

01:17:26.303 --> 01:17:29.363
- This is a, uh, gift...
- Hi, Jordy.

01:17:29.439 --> 01:17:31.430
<i>- You can't talk.
- No, but go on.</i>

01:17:31.508 --> 01:17:34.204
<i>- I had to leave.
- I know.</i>

01:17:34.277 --> 01:17:37.872
<i>- Ben Franklin!
- But the truth is, um...</i>

01:17:37.948 --> 01:17:40.143
<i>- Yes?
- ... I didn't get very far.</i>

01:17:40.217 --> 01:17:43.186
Beautiful smile, lovely eyes,
one-of-a-kind woman.

01:17:43.253 --> 01:17:45.847
- Marie!
- Yes.

01:17:45.922 --> 01:17:49.187
Oh, honey, don't,
don't, don't...

01:17:55.165 --> 01:17:58.191
- Dad?
- Hey, you.

01:17:58.268 --> 01:18:03.001
- Can I show you what I made?
- First thing when I get back, OK?

01:18:03.073 --> 01:18:05.132
OK.

01:18:18.121 --> 01:18:20.612
- You again.
- Nice to see you, officer.

01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:23.182
- How are you today?
- You know why I pulled you over?

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:28.027
I sure do. I know what I was
doing and I know it's all wrong.

01:18:28.098 --> 01:18:31.397
- This is gonna cost you.
- Put it on my tab.

01:18:31.468 --> 01:18:35.336
- What was that?
- Put it on my tab.

01:19:03.633 --> 01:19:07.797
What are we doing?

01:19:09.005 --> 01:19:11.166
- It may be wrong.
- Yes.

01:19:11.241 --> 01:19:14.733
But there's a certain rightness
to our wrongness, I think.

01:19:14.811 --> 01:19:17.279
I think, um,
we've got to think.

01:19:17.347 --> 01:19:19.941
I mean, your girls,
and how do we?

01:19:20.016 --> 01:19:21.813
They're extraordinary and...

01:19:25.288 --> 01:19:30.749
- What?
- I think this is all premature.

01:19:34.798 --> 01:19:37.699
You do?

01:19:40.237 --> 01:19:42.671
We don't even know
if you can bowl.

01:20:00.524 --> 01:20:02.856
All right. No, don't! Wait.

01:20:02.926 --> 01:20:04.484
Wait. No, no.
You have to line up.

01:20:04.561 --> 01:20:05.892
- Leave me alone!
- Line up.

01:20:05.962 --> 01:20:08.430
- Come on.
- You come on. All right.

01:20:08.498 --> 01:20:10.728
I'm just watching you.
I'm not...

01:20:10.801 --> 01:20:13.770
- Ready?
- Woo!

01:20:13.837 --> 01:20:17.773
Oh! Thank you.

01:20:18.909 --> 01:20:20.740
That's...

01:20:20.811 --> 01:20:24.303
I liked that. That was a terrible shot,
but I loved this at the end.

01:20:24.381 --> 01:20:27.179
Oh, I wouldn't go yet.

01:20:29.553 --> 01:20:33.683
Not bad. That's good.

01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:42.525
You're gonna break your arm like that.

01:20:42.599 --> 01:20:46.091
Oh!

01:20:46.169 --> 01:20:48.535
No, no. Don't do it.

01:20:54.477 --> 01:20:57.037
Oh, come on,
come on, come on!

01:20:57.113 --> 01:20:59.604
- Yay!
- Let's go at the same time.

01:20:59.683 --> 01:21:01.674
One, two, three.

01:21:27.744 --> 01:21:29.837
Dad?

01:21:29.913 --> 01:21:32.006
Oh, my God.
Dad, what are you doing?

01:21:32.082 --> 01:21:34.380
- Oh...
- What the hell? Marie?

01:21:34.451 --> 01:21:36.316
- Hey.
- What the hell's going on?

01:21:36.386 --> 01:21:38.513
- We'll go.
- They were just kissing.

01:21:38.588 --> 01:21:41.250
I can explain.

01:21:42.759 --> 01:21:44.750
- You two broke up, right?
- Two hours ago.

01:21:44.828 --> 01:21:47.956
- We broke up two hours ago.
- I know, I know, I know.

01:21:48.031 --> 01:21:49.521
I thought that you left.

01:21:49.599 --> 01:21:53.194
She did. She left, but she
just didn't get very far.

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:55.738
- What?
- I can explain this.

01:21:55.805 --> 01:21:58.069
- Yeah, let him explain.
- OK.

01:21:58.141 --> 01:22:03.169
Remember the woman at
the bookstore? Here she is.

01:22:05.115 --> 01:22:07.208
You told me to go after her,
and I didn't.

01:22:07.284 --> 01:22:09.047
It wasn't planned, Mitch.

01:22:09.119 --> 01:22:13.215
I know how this looks. But,
Mitch, I also know how it feels.

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:15.258
How does this feel,
you son of a bitch?

01:22:15.325 --> 01:22:17.293
Oh, my God!

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.692
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry.

01:22:19.763 --> 01:22:22.197
Everybody, take it easy.
You're not helping.

01:22:22.265 --> 01:22:24.893
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

01:22:24.968 --> 01:22:28.495
Oh, darling.
Get some ice. Oh!

01:22:28.571 --> 01:22:31.597
- Dan, you all right? You OK?
- Marie!

01:22:31.675 --> 01:22:34.473
No, don't go!

01:22:34.544 --> 01:22:37.172
I don't know what we were thinking.

01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:40.514
I'm sorry.

01:22:40.583 --> 01:22:43.882
Don't go.

01:22:48.525 --> 01:22:50.390
Dad? Get...

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.758
Dad, wait!

01:22:52.829 --> 01:22:57.232
What are you doing? Dad!

01:23:07.911 --> 01:23:11.142
All right, this is your summons
for your court appearance.

01:23:11.214 --> 01:23:14.479
One last thing. You need
to surrender your license.

01:23:29.032 --> 01:23:30.897
You have guests.

01:23:34.237 --> 01:23:36.933
- Oh! Speak of the devil. Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:37.007 --> 01:23:40.135
Cindy Lamson. Editor of special
features, Lamson Newspaper Group.

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:41.973
- Hi.
- Jim Lamson, publisher.

01:23:42.045 --> 01:23:43.842
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

01:23:43.913 --> 01:23:47.041
We've been sitting here
chatting with your family.

01:23:47.117 --> 01:23:50.883
We've especially enjoyed the pleasure
of meeting your lovely daughters.

01:23:50.954 --> 01:23:52.785
- Oh.
- Hot cider?

01:23:52.856 --> 01:23:55.882
Thank you. That looks...
Thank you very much.

01:23:55.959 --> 01:23:58.359
Looks great. Thanks.

01:23:59.796 --> 01:24:02.424
Father? Hot cider?

01:24:02.499 --> 01:24:04.490
Not only are you a murderer of love,

01:24:04.567 --> 01:24:06.558
but you're the worst parent ever.

01:24:08.071 --> 01:24:10.471
Sweet.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.509
Well, um, as you probably know,

01:24:13.576 --> 01:24:15.874
we have met with
two other candidates,

01:24:15.945 --> 01:24:18.004
but my father and I are confident

01:24:18.081 --> 01:24:20.606
that we have saved
the best for last.

01:24:22.786 --> 01:24:24.583
Uh, girls.
You can leave if you like.

01:24:24.654 --> 01:24:27.748
Oh. If it's all right,
perhaps they should stay.

01:24:27.824 --> 01:24:29.849
We like to keep the family involved.

01:24:29.926 --> 01:24:34.022
Well, Dan, here, he knows all about
keeping things in the family.

01:24:34.097 --> 01:24:36.691
- Don't you, Dan?
- That's why we're so drawn to you.

01:24:36.766 --> 01:24:39.633
What you represent in your column,
your moral values.

01:24:39.702 --> 01:24:43.263
The personal characteristics that
are reflected in your writing,

01:24:43.339 --> 01:24:46.365
- Very impressive.
- Honesty, trustworthiness...

01:24:46.443 --> 01:24:48.570
And we have
great plans for you, Dan.

01:24:48.645 --> 01:24:53.082
What we try to do is what you
keep telling your readers to do.

01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:56.209
- What's that?
- Put family first.

01:24:56.286 --> 01:24:59.517
OK. OK. Here's the thing.

01:25:01.191 --> 01:25:04.592
Somebody hasn't been
reading his own column.

01:25:04.661 --> 01:25:08.654
I'm not sure what that means.

01:25:20.543 --> 01:25:25.742
Go away. You're a liar and a hypocrite.
Cheating with your brother's girlfriend?

01:25:25.815 --> 01:25:27.180
How long did you know her?

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:31.778
Two moving violations and a collision?
Was that part of the plan?

01:25:31.855 --> 01:25:34.483
Worst of all, you blew off Lilly.

01:25:34.557 --> 01:25:37.390
She's been wanting to show you
something she made for you.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.690
But you never showed up.

01:27:08.751 --> 01:27:10.685
Hm.

01:27:12.989 --> 01:27:15.253
- I really messed up.
- No, you didn't.

01:27:15.325 --> 01:27:18.590
Yeah, I did, Mom.
What I did to Lilly.

01:27:18.661 --> 01:27:21.425
- Don't forget Mitch.
- Oh, John.

01:27:21.497 --> 01:27:23.829
And those newspaper people.

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.869
Admittedly, not a good day
for you, honey.

01:27:26.936 --> 01:27:30.929
If I just stay focused
on being their dad...

01:27:31.007 --> 01:27:34.238
Oh, please.
You know, love is messy.

01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:38.269
I should know better.
I hurt my kids.

01:27:38.348 --> 01:27:40.373
Go un-hurt them.

01:27:40.450 --> 01:27:44.784
- Honey, you've made some mistakes.
- Many, so many.

01:27:44.854 --> 01:27:47.721
Falling for Marie wasn't one of them.

01:27:51.527 --> 01:27:54.189
Can somebody get me another box,
please?

01:27:54.264 --> 01:27:56.698
Yep, yep. Coming.

01:27:58.701 --> 01:28:00.134
Mitch.

01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:03.404
Mitch, I...

01:28:08.011 --> 01:28:10.172
If it was anybody else...

01:28:10.847 --> 01:28:13.543
I am so...

01:28:15.685 --> 01:28:18.245
Hold that thought.

01:28:23.893 --> 01:28:26.418
Hey, beautiful.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:50.119
Girls, I'd like to talk
to Lilly alone, if I could.

01:29:01.497 --> 01:29:03.294
OK, then. All of you.

01:29:13.943 --> 01:29:16.207
I know I messed up.
Big time.

01:29:16.279 --> 01:29:18.144
- Yep.
- Yes, you did.

01:29:18.214 --> 01:29:21.980
Now, your mom...

01:29:24.153 --> 01:29:25.780
I miss your mom.

01:29:25.855 --> 01:29:28.756
All the time and I always will.

01:29:28.825 --> 01:29:33.125
- Mom's gone.
- Aw, honey. I see her every day.

01:29:33.196 --> 01:29:35.824
I see her in your goodness, Jane.

01:29:35.898 --> 01:29:39.595
And, Cara, your passion.

01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:43.571
And, Lilly, you have her eyes.

01:29:43.639 --> 01:29:45.334
And her smile.

01:29:47.543 --> 01:29:49.568
So here's what I'm going to do:

01:29:49.645 --> 01:29:53.081
I am grounding myself for life.

01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:56.812
I'm sticking with you.
I am going to be with you...

01:29:56.886 --> 01:30:01.482
- You're with us every day.
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:30:01.557 --> 01:30:05.220
See, I got a little confused with Marie,

01:30:05.294 --> 01:30:09.492
but that is over. OK?

01:30:09.565 --> 01:30:13.501
I kinda lost my head.

01:30:13.569 --> 01:30:17.903
Got a little stupid because I love her.

01:30:17.974 --> 01:30:22.638
That's... That's not...

01:30:22.712 --> 01:30:25.112
I don't love her.
And that's not what I meant.

01:30:25.181 --> 01:30:27.945
I mean, how could I love her?
I've only known her...

01:30:28.017 --> 01:30:31.509
- Three days.
- Yeah.

01:30:31.587 --> 01:30:35.250
And how can you know in three days?

01:30:39.295 --> 01:30:40.694
I don't know.

01:30:40.763 --> 01:30:44.494
Yes, I do. I love her.

01:30:44.567 --> 01:30:46.660
I love her. I love her.

01:30:46.736 --> 01:30:50.672
I love her. I love...

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.264
I love her.

01:30:55.578 --> 01:30:57.239
Then go get her.

01:30:59.182 --> 01:31:01.412
We so prefer her to you.

01:31:11.394 --> 01:31:12.520
Go.

01:31:16.532 --> 01:31:18.591
- Now.
- Oh.

01:31:27.043 --> 01:31:29.534
Honey. Honey. For the road.

01:31:39.121 --> 01:31:41.112
- What is it?
- I can't do it.

01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:43.351
- You must.
- I don't have a license.

01:32:00.877 --> 01:32:04.040
I'm pretty good with maps.

01:32:04.113 --> 01:32:08.982
This is so queer.
But I wouldn't miss it for anything.

01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.794
<i>Dear readers,
for most of you,</i>

01:32:22.865 --> 01:32:26.266
<i>this is my first
column in your paper.</i>

01:32:26.335 --> 01:32:28.963
<i>In the future, I will be
answering your questions,</i>

01:32:29.038 --> 01:32:32.633
<i>but today, I wanna break from
my usual format and talk to you</i>

01:32:32.708 --> 01:32:35.734
<i>about the subject of plans.</i>

01:32:35.811 --> 01:32:39.770
<i>Not so much my plan for this column,
more like life plans.</i>

01:32:39.849 --> 01:32:41.476
<i>How we all make them.</i>

01:32:41.551 --> 01:32:46.682
<i>And how we hope that our kids make
good, smart, safe plans of their own.</i>

01:32:46.756 --> 01:32:50.089
<i>But if we're really
honest with ourselves,</i>

01:32:50.159 --> 01:32:54.528
<i>most of the time our plans
don't work out as we'd hoped.</i>

01:32:59.201 --> 01:33:01.396
<i>So instead of asking our young people,</i>

01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:05.429
<i>"What are your plans? What do
you plan to do with your life?"</i>

01:33:05.508 --> 01:33:10.844
<i>Maybe we should tell them this:
Plan to be surprised.</i>

01:34:32.261 --> 01:34:34.320
It's falling out.

01:37:47.523 --> 01:37:49.047
And that's it.
