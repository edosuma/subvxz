WEBVTT

00:11.920 --> 00:14.047
- So this girl
is super hot, right?

00:14.100 --> 00:17.092
I mean, she's 20 years
younger than me, but, I mean,

00:17.140 --> 00:20.314
she can't keep her hands off me.
Seriously! The moment
I walk through that door,

00:20.360 --> 00:23.056
she is all up on this.
You know what I mean?

00:23.110 --> 00:25.715
- Oh yeah!
- Ohhh, good.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.670
Yeah, I'm real sorry, man.
I'm just sitting here
bragging. I don't mean

00:30.720 --> 00:32.711
to bore you, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

00:32.770 --> 00:35.409
Don't leave me hanging,
I'll toss you out of my cab.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.686
So how many times
you been with this one?

00:39.730 --> 00:41.982
- Oh... Uh, like...

00:42.040 --> 00:45.294
18 andla half.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.342
- Yeah, wife came home
early one time,

00:47.390 --> 00:49.608
almost caught us. That is why
it is strictly hotels

00:49.650 --> 00:51.606
from here on out.
- Nothing but the best.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.560
- Yeah, you got it.

00:53.610 --> 00:55.566
I mean, OK, sure, sure,

00:55.620 --> 00:58.783
I mean, technically,
I am paying her for her time

00:58.840 --> 01:01.400
but I for one don't believe
you can fake that kind of lust.

01:01.450 --> 01:04.089
You're a handsome man.

01:04.150 --> 01:06.232
I mean, not
in the classical sense,

01:06.280 --> 01:08.441
but you've definitely got
the "it" factor.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.230
I noticed that as soon
as you got In my cab.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.022
Alright, here we go!

01:14.070 --> 01:17.244
Chamberlain Arms Hotel!

01:19.550 --> 01:23.168
_ - Sweet! Here is
a little something extra.

01:23.210 --> 01:25.371
You know what? You're
a really good guy to talk to.

01:25.430 --> 01:27.512
- Getting the details
is the best part of my job.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.814
- Oh yeah.

01:33.570 --> 01:36.994
- Yeah, we got it.
- More importantly,

01:37.050 --> 01:41.089
his so_on-to-be e_x-wife
IS gonng to get It too.

01:41.140 --> 01:44.132
The "it" factor?
- echoing: [I had
to say something.]

01:44.190 --> 01:46.090
He wanted so badly
to believe.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.017
- [Can you turn off
that mic, please

01:48.060 --> 01:50.756
is coming here in stereo here,
and it's twice as annoying.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.883
- Fine.

01:53.930 --> 01:57.286
You know there's something
to a taxi driver's life.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.378
- Oh, you just say the word,

01:59.420 --> 02:01.854
and I will whip up
a killer reference letter.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.856
- Yeah, I bet you will.

02:08.950 --> 02:10.599
Hey, what are you doing?
- I need a ride.

02:10.650 --> 02:13.039
- So calla... Oh!

02:13.080 --> 02:16.561
That's right. Umm, I'm off duty.

02:16.610 --> 02:19.989
- Your light is on.
- Uh, no it's not.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.610
- Yes it is! Man, I can see you
trying to shut it off!

02:22.660 --> 02:26.005
Rules are rules, OK? Light is on
means you gotta take me.

02:26.050 --> 02:28.314
Please. Please.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.442
- Fine.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.939
- Nolan.

02:40.590 --> 02:44.196
Is that police-charity-drive
season already?

02:44.250 --> 02:45.899
- I just got off the phone
with Beck Taxi,

02:45.940 --> 02:47.988
and I can't believe what I'm
about to ask, but is Shade

02:48.030 --> 02:50.248
driving one of their cabs?
- Uhhh, we were running

02:50.300 --> 02:52.336
a sting to catch
an unfaithful husband. Why?

02:52.380 --> 02:54.996
- I think he just picked up

02:55.040 --> 02:57.167
a murderer.

03:01.310 --> 03:05.087
- I see you and you see me

03:05.140 --> 03:07.267
Watch you blowing the lines

03:07.310 --> 03:09.221
When you're making a scene

03:09.270 --> 03:13.001
Oh boy, you've got to know

03:13.060 --> 03:15.221
What my head overlooks

03:15.280 --> 03:18.795
The senses will show
to my heart

03:18.850 --> 03:21.148
When it's watching for lies

03:21.200 --> 03:23.760
'Cause you can't escape my

03:23.810 --> 03:25.630
- Private eyes

03:25.680 --> 03:27.716
They're watching you

03:27.770 --> 03:30.159
Private eyes

03:30.210 --> 03:32.019
They're watching you,
watching you

03:32.080 --> 03:34.207
Watching you, watching you

03:41.650 --> 03:44.039
- The victim's name is
Dr. Tanya Poponov,

03:44.090 --> 03:46.786
a professor of psychiatry
at Dixon University.

03:46.830 --> 03:49.697
[Been staying at the Chamberlain
Arms Hotel the past 6 weeks,]

03:49.750 --> 03:52.480
and was shot and killed in her
room less than half an hour ago.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.612
- What does that have
to do with Shade?

03:54.660 --> 03:56.742
- [Well, the suspect was seen
fleeing the scene by one]

03:56.800 --> 03:58.222
of the hotel maids
and spotted

03:58.280 --> 04:01.534
getting into cab number A711.
- Ours.

04:01.580 --> 04:03.457
- Right. Brings me
to my next question:

04:03.500 --> 04:05.365
why the hell is Shade
taking on random fares?

04:05.410 --> 04:07.458
- I don't know.
But Shade is a master

04:07.500 --> 04:09.548
at reading people. If there is
a murderer in his car,

04:09.590 --> 04:11.455
then he's already
figured it out.

04:11.510 --> 04:14.206
- I mean sure, the Leafs
are on track right now,

04:14.250 --> 04:16.684
but, let's be honest,

04:16.730 --> 04:19.244
we've all been
hurt before. Hahahaha!

04:21.470 --> 04:23.426
You know, you never really
get to appreciate

04:23.480 --> 04:25.823
this city
until you drive around it

04:25.870 --> 04:27.861
with no particular place to go.

04:27.910 --> 04:29.787
Speaking of which,
you got a destination

04:29.830 --> 04:32.003
in mind?
Is that a thing?

04:32.050 --> 04:34.268
Do I... Is that necessary?

04:34.310 --> 04:37.655
- Well, you are in a cab.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.871
I'll figure it out.

04:39.930 --> 04:42.967
- You're the boss.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.016
[Yeah, I am bringing
the taxi back.]

04:51.070 --> 04:52.970
- Pretend you're talking
to Jules.

04:55.030 --> 04:56.986
She wants to watch a scary movie
with her friends.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.760
- Did you change
your allergy medication again?

04:59.820 --> 05:03.074
- Just do it.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.293
Are you sure

05:05.340 --> 05:07.808
Caveman Throats_lasher
IS really appropriate?

05:07.870 --> 05:10.691
- The man in the back
of your cab may have
just committed a murder.

05:12.610 --> 05:15.659
- Uh... I hear you.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.227
So... who's coming over?

05:19.270 --> 05:21.226
- Uh, I have Nolan
on the other line.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.090
He said that squad cars
are close by,

05:23.140 --> 05:25.313
[but they won't move in
unﬁlyouTe

05:25.360 --> 05:27.578
- Wow, that sounds

05:27.630 --> 05:30.144
like a late start.

05:30.190 --> 05:32.146
in one minute, OK,
with an exact location

05:32.200 --> 05:34.623
of where you're gonna drive to.
Just... Is that all clear?

05:34.680 --> 05:36.762
- Yes.

05:36.810 --> 05:39.199
Well, you figure it out

05:39.250 --> 05:42.151
and call me back
when you've decided.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.460
Uhhh,

05:46.520 --> 05:48.465
sorry about that.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.556
It's my daughter.
She wants to watch a movie

05:50.610 --> 05:52.999
with her boyfriend.
Do you have kids?

05:53.040 --> 05:54.951
- I have a daughter.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.173
- Yeah, we used

05:57.220 --> 05:59.950
to watch movies too.

06:00.010 --> 06:02.137
- No. No, no for a long time.

06:03.970 --> 06:05.961
Hey, can I tell you something,

06:06.010 --> 06:08.478
father to father?
- Sure.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.223
- You guard your relationship
with your daughter

06:10.280 --> 06:13.272
like it's gold, man.
You may not believe

06:13.320 --> 06:15.845
it's possible right now,
but you can lose it.

06:15.890 --> 06:19.155
- Well, thanks. That's good
advice. I'll remember that.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.554
]
- ETF is setting up
at a gas station

06:34.610 --> 06:36.692
at Parliament and Venue.
It's our best shot

06:36.740 --> 06:38.822
at taking this guy
while risking the fewest lives.

06:38.870 --> 06:41.088
- OK. I'll call Shade.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.781
There's something else.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.663
- I've patched Nolan in as well.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.453
- Uh, the murder weapon
was a handgun,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.400
and it hasn't been found,
so there's a possibility

06:59.460 --> 07:01.587
that your passenger
might be armed as well.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.712
- Well, that's not
reassuring me, honey.

07:03.770 --> 07:07.149
- Is there any way
that you can safely check to see

07:12.470 --> 07:13.858
- Yes,

07:13.910 --> 07:16.333
[there's a lot of violence
in that movie.]

07:16.390 --> 07:18.551
- Understood.

07:18.610 --> 07:20.384
- Listen, Shade,
Nolan wants you to drive

07:20.440 --> 07:22.431
to the intersection
of Parliament and Venue.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.391
Pull into the gas station there.
When you're safely

07:24.440 --> 07:26.658
[out of the cab,
ETF will move in.]

07:26.700 --> 07:28.486
- Fine, watch Caveman
Throatslasherif you like,

07:28.530 --> 07:30.703
but don't blame me
when you have nightmares.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.650
- Everything's gonna be fine,
OK? Just stick to the plan.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.701
[Nolan, I'll meet you
at the police station.]

07:36.760 --> 07:39.274
- Hey, listen, umm,

07:39.320 --> 07:41.368
as long as the meter's running
there's no pressure

07:41.410 --> 07:43.674
to choose a destination,
but would you mind

07:43.720 --> 07:46.416
if we made a stop
so I could use the bathroom?

07:46.460 --> 07:48.678
- No, wait.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.982
Let's go to the airport.

07:50.030 --> 07:52.339
OK, I want you to take me
to Pearson right now.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.428
- Yeah! Ha!

07:54.470 --> 07:58.258
My airline points
are about to expire, so...

07:58.300 --> 08:00.814
Ha! Just turn around, OK?

08:00.870 --> 08:02.770
- Yeah, sure.
Pearson, no problem.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.469
Uh, would you mind

08:05.520 --> 08:07.385
if we still made
that bathroom stop?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.601
I've been drinking coffee
since 9

08:09.660 --> 08:11.560
and nature's call is becoming
a little more of a shout.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.224
Hahaha!
- Just, uh,

08:13.270 --> 08:15.921
just don't think
about it, right?

08:15.970 --> 08:18.575
- Yeah, sure.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.235
: Suspect vehicle
is a green and orange taxi

08:23.280 --> 08:25.100
number A711 heading eastbound.

08:25.150 --> 08:28.677
They'd have a bathroom.
- Nah, it's too dirty.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.190
- OK, there's a coffee shop.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.810
- Too cramped.
Goldilocks?

08:34.860 --> 08:37.328
- Look, there's
a small gas station

08:37.380 --> 08:40.338
a buddy of mine owns. He lets me
use his private washroom.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.382
Job like this,
a clean place

08:42.430 --> 08:44.421
to do your business
is like gold.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.608
- Torvald.

08:47.650 --> 08:50.210
- Helsinki.

08:54.010 --> 08:56.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
- Do not stop this cab!

08:56.880 --> 08:59.269
- Take it easy.
- Just keep driving!

09:01.320 --> 09:04.187
: Acknowledged. We have a visual on the target vehicle.

09:04.230 --> 09:06.619
Two occupants.
All teams, standby.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.628
Driver will exit and clear,
at which point team 1 and 2

09:09.670 --> 09:11.490
will surround and secure.
- Angle,

09:11.550 --> 09:13.154
you shouldn't be in here.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.634
- Half a kilometre.
Guys, quiet down in there!

09:15.680 --> 09:18.376
: Target approaching.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.115
One hundred metres.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.764
Ready strike. 50...

09:23.910 --> 09:26.731
: Target vehicle is out

09:26.780 --> 09:29.738
of operational range.
All teams, stand down.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.568
- Look, buddy, I don't know
what this is,

09:33.610 --> 09:35.601
but I don't want any part of it.
I'm just a cabbie.

09:35.660 --> 09:38.083
Right.
Who were you talking to?

09:38.140 --> 09:40.654
- My daughter. I told you.
- STOP LYING TO ME!

09:40.710 --> 09:44.180
"Caveman Throatslasher," huh?
"Torvald Helsinki"?

09:44.230 --> 09:46.482
Who the hell are you?

09:53.370 --> 09:55.235
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- All your partner had to do

09:55.290 --> 09:57.235
was pull over for some gas;
how hard is that?

09:57.290 --> 10:00.635
- Shade was clear
on the instructions, OK?
Something must have gone wrong.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.636
- Yeah, great. Alright, alright.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.467
OK, bye. We lost the cab.
!

10:05.510 --> 10:07.899
- They went into a high-traffic
area, and our tail started

10:07.950 --> 10:09.906
following the wrong car.
- Is it still considered

10:09.950 --> 10:11.906
police brutality
if it's going the other way?

10:11.950 --> 10:13.861
- OK, it's only temporary,
the net's been thrown.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.866
Also, we picked up
the victim's husband.

10:15.910 --> 10:17.514
Maybe he can help us
figure out who this guy is.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.606
- You don't know
who the killer is?!

10:19.660 --> 10:21.821
- We're working on it.
OK, I need to eat

10:21.880 --> 10:24.041
a truckload of crap.
Excuse me. Hi, sir.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.398
Yeah. No, we lost the cab

10:26.450 --> 10:28.224
I'm not sure that kind
of language IS necessary,

10:28.270 --> 10:30.659
but OK, yeah.

10:30.710 --> 10:33.929
- You've probably heard the term
"self-actualization" before.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.323
It gets thrown around a lot,
more than it should

10:36.370 --> 10:38.543
if you ask me.

10:38.590 --> 10:41.809
But what does it actually mean? What constitutes fulfillment

10:41.850 --> 10:44.501
of the human soul?
And more Importantly,

10:44.550 --> 10:46.893
what can_ we learn
from this deSIre

10:46.950 --> 10:49.635
that we all seem to have?

10:51.380 --> 10:53.735
- Hey, Zoe. You haven't heard
from Shade, have you?

10:53.780 --> 10:56.476
- [No. But I have been looking
into the victim, Tanya Poponov.]

10:56.520 --> 10:59.250
She only recently began teaching
at Dixon University.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.040
Before that, she had
her own psychiatry practice.

11:02.090 --> 11:05.651
[Also, given her online posts,
I think she was in the middle]

11:05.700 --> 11:07.656
of a conscious uncoupling
with her husband,

11:07.710 --> 11:10.315
which would explain why she was
staying at the Chamberlain Arms.

11:13.060 --> 11:14.755
- What about the microphone
in the cab?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.927
- It's not on.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.847
- Because I told him
to turn it off.

11:19.890 --> 11:22.358
- Ah, come on, man!

11:22.420 --> 11:24.149
I liked that phone!

11:27.510 --> 11:30.070
- Who were you talking to
on that phone

11:30.120 --> 11:32.680
Did you even have a daughter?

11:32.730 --> 11:34.334
- Yes, I have a daughter.

11:34.380 --> 11:37.816
- Ugh! Jeez!

11:37.870 --> 11:40.293
Yeah?

11:42.260 --> 11:44.649
What was gonna happen
at that gas station, huh?

11:44.700 --> 11:47.043
Is it an ambush?

11:47.090 --> 11:49.308
You a cop?
- I'm not a cop.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.397
- That doesn't sound

11:52.450 --> 11:54.133
like a question
I should answer honestly.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.531
- I'm_ not an idiot!
- I'm a prIvate Investigator.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.150
I was talking to my partner
and yes, there were police

12:04.200 --> 12:06.100
waiting for you
at the gas station.

12:08.070 --> 12:10.459
- I'm just gonna reach
in my back pocket,

12:10.510 --> 12:12.193
get my wallet,
you can see it for yourself.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.608
- Nobody.

12:21.650 --> 12:24.733
You're a PI driving
a taxi and nobody hired you?

12:24.780 --> 12:28.079
- It does sound odd now that
I hear you say it out loud.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.215
- Look, we were running
a sting operation,

12:32.270 --> 12:35.262
nothing to do with you,
you just got into my cab.

12:35.310 --> 12:37.528
- Oh, yeah, right.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.536
Yeah, like I just happened
to go to that hotel room.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.185
!
- OK.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.233
Get in.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.805
GET IN the... Go!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, OK.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.940
So, uh,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.865
where to?

13:07.910 --> 13:09.775
- Just turn around.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.912
- Buckle up. I don't want to get pulled over by the cops.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.212
- Right, you can't hear me.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.928
- I have proof of life.
I have proof of life!

13:24.970 --> 13:27.575
- OK, calm down.
What are you talking about?

13:27.630 --> 13:30.713
- Shade turned the mic on.
I can hear them talking.

13:32.940 --> 13:34.669
but the guy seems
really upset with Shade.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.847
- That doesn't tell us anything.
Five minutes with Shade,

13:36.900 --> 13:38.891
and "pretty upset" is a lock!
: Follow me.

13:38.940 --> 13:42.114
This way.
- Oh, Zoey, listen.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.242
If you get anything on where
they're going or who this guy is

13:44.300 --> 13:46.905
you call me immediately, OK?
Don't let me down, Zoey.

13:46.950 --> 13:50.647
Is that the victim's ex
- Yeah, Ijust brought him in.

13:50.690 --> 13:52.646
- Need to observe the interview.
- Angle, you're not even allowed

13:52.700 --> 13:54.645
to OK, good talk.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.476
- I know I have zero credibility
on the subject,

13:57.530 --> 13:59.828
but I really do have to go
to the bathroom now.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.178
Who's behind this?

14:02.230 --> 14:04.698
- Or we could discuss
your Issue.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.537
Look, buddy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.447
I was just sitting in my cab;
how was I supposed to know

14:10.500 --> 14:12.627
you'd come out at that moment?
- Because you're part of it!

14:12.670 --> 14:15.104
g
- The setup!

14:19.640 --> 14:23.280
I'm being framed for murder.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.763
: I'm sorry you have
to see this, but we need an ID.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.254
- It's her.
- Sorry.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.699
So the two of you were going
through a divorce?

14:40.740 --> 14:43.652
Would you say it was amicable?
- It was a divorce.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.043
Tanya and I
weren't on good terms.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.261
I'd never want
anything like this to happen.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.447
- Can you think of anyone who
would want to do this to Tanya?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.572
- Lots of people.
- Say again.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.700
- This is one
of her ex-patients.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.320
It had to be.

14:57.370 --> 14:59.270
- The reason
our marriage went south

14:59.330 --> 15:01.025
is 'cause of Tanya's devotion
to her work.

15:01.070 --> 15:02.970
She lived
for her patients.

15:03.030 --> 15:05.373
In my opinion,

15:05.420 --> 15:07.376
many of them
took advantage of that.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.638
It just all got
to be too much.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.339
- Is that why she stopped
practicing and moved

15:11.380 --> 15:14.816
into teaching?
- She was...

15:14.870 --> 15:17.122
trying to work on us,

15:17.170 --> 15:19.695
but it was too little,
too late.

15:19.740 --> 15:22.254
- I'm guessing some patients
weren't happy about that move.

15:22.310 --> 15:24.392
- It's an understatement.

15:28.570 --> 15:30.652
- Alright, let's just say,
for argument sake,

15:30.710 --> 15:32.701
that you are being
framed for murder,

15:32.750 --> 15:36.368
taking an hostage at gunpoint
is doing the other half
of the job for them,

15:36.410 --> 15:39.584
wouldn't you say? Look,
I know some cops, good ones;

15:39.630 --> 15:41.973
why don't we go turn
ourselves in, call a lavwer,

15:42.020 --> 15:44.102
figure all this out?
- No way.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.970
No way. Not 'til I figure out
who's behind this.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.373
And FYI, I still
don't trust you either.

15:49.420 --> 15:52.116
- Yeah, feeling's mutual, pal.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.685
Alright, let's start with this.
Who do you think's framing you?

15:54.730 --> 15:57.597
- I don't know.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.072
- Well, whose murder
are they framing you for?

15:59.130 --> 16:02.509
- "Matt Shade."

16:02.570 --> 16:05.994
Shadow

16:06.050 --> 16:08.006
- Guilty.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.564
- Oh, wow!

16:10.620 --> 16:13.441
I should have known
you name wasn't Edison Amadeus.

16:13.490 --> 16:16.220
_ Ha! How surreal
is this day gonna get?

16:16.270 --> 16:18.226
: You're asking me?

16:18.280 --> 16:20.703
- I watched you play.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.140
You, you were a pest from hell!
- Ah, you're too kind.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.670
- You were the most annoying
thing on skates.
- Please!

16:28.720 --> 16:30.540
- You were like a human tick.
You know what, buddy?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.501
That's enough, thanks.
- Ooh!

16:34.730 --> 16:36.948
- So that's my name;
what do I call you?

16:40.690 --> 16:42.738
- Chris.

16:42.780 --> 16:46.250
I remember you
in the playoffs with Chicago.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.916
- Yeah. Yeah, I was working

16:48.960 --> 16:52.259
at Derocher Plant, in Hamilton, and I had you in my pool!

16:52.310 --> 16:54.392
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah, you didn't score

16:54.440 --> 16:57.091
too much, but you sure made
your presence felt, man.

16:58.930 --> 17:02.013
Wow!

17:10.630 --> 17:13.190
- Gotcha.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.542
- Hey.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.374
[is either Chris Henley
or Chris Marsden.]

17:19.420 --> 17:21.376
But if I had to guess,
I would say Henley

17:21.430 --> 17:23.386
because his voice
seems a lot softer

17:23.430 --> 17:26.558
and this other guy
looks like Attila the Hun

17:26.610 --> 17:28.419
before he had
his morning coffee.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.163
- Thanks Zoe.
Keep listening.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.347
Alright, the suspect's name
is Chris Henley.

17:32.390 --> 17:34.346
- Just check it out.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.265
- You're killing me.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.358
Question:
did Tanya have a patient

17:43.410 --> 17:45.924
by the name of Chris Henley?

17:45.970 --> 17:48.018
- Yeah.
- He's the worst.

17:48.060 --> 17:51.143
Calls at night and on the
weekends. No boundaries at all.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.885
Did he do this?
- We don't know

17:53.940 --> 17:55.760
anything for sure yet.
Have you ever met Chris Henley?

17:55.810 --> 17:58.415
- Tanya's office
a couple of times.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.759
He would stare at her
with this creepy puppy-dog look.

18:01.810 --> 18:04.426
I knew that guy was no good.

18:04.470 --> 18:07.519
But I thought it was over
when she got rid of him.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.733
- She punted him

18:09.780 --> 18:12.999
to a colleague of hers,
Jed something.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.735
- We'll be right back.

18:20.790 --> 18:24.044
Who is Chris Henley
and how do we know about him?
- Guy in the cab with the gun,

18:24.100 --> 18:26.398
and I_ know because we're still
Wired-in from our sting.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.577
Wired to what
- Yeah.

18:28.620 --> 18:32.442
- When were you gonna
tell me about this?
- It just happened.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.321
Look, as much as I love
your patented I-can't-
believe-you-did-this glare,

18:38.420 --> 18:41.412
- To be--
- Continued. Yeah, got it.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.325
- Let's get this out
on the wire.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.280
Get a surveillance tech
over at Everett agency.

18:45.340 --> 18:46.898
- OK.

18:57.350 --> 18:59.910
Chris?
Yeah?

18:59.960 --> 19:03.179
- What are we thinking
back there?

19:03.220 --> 19:07.179
Haha! I was thinking, uh,

19:07.230 --> 19:09.186
maybe all the things
you do wrong in your life,

19:09.230 --> 19:11.186
they, like, add up
to something like this.

19:11.230 --> 19:13.835
- I don't follow.
- I woke up this morning

19:13.890 --> 19:16.188
feeling really good!
I was feeling really good,

19:16.240 --> 19:19.198
and then,
now I'm holding a hostage.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.027
Ha! don't know
how to hold a hostage.
Is this how you do it?

19:22.070 --> 19:24.630
- Hey, if nothing else,
let me assure you,

19:24.680 --> 19:27.069
you're doing a bang-up job
at hostage holding.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.543
Especially considering
it's your ﬁrst time.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.556
It is your first time, right?
- Yeah.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.161
- OK.

19:35.210 --> 19:37.735
- Pull over!

19:37.780 --> 19:39.953
Pull over, pull over!

19:52.010 --> 19:53.830
- Chris, you need
to turn yourself in.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.745
It's your only play here.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.974
- Get out of the car, Shadow.

19:59.020 --> 20:01.454
Leave the keys.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.320
You don't need
to get mixed up in all this.

20:27.610 --> 20:29.828
- Were you really
gonna let me go?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.654
- Yeah.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.520
You said you had nothing
to do with it, I believed you.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.623
Oh. What are you doing?

20:40.670 --> 20:42.922
- I told you I was

20:42.980 --> 20:46.063
a private investigator, right?

20:46.110 --> 20:48.977
- So, I just took you on
as a client.

21:04.610 --> 21:06.828
- Airports, train stations,

21:08.830 --> 21:11.344
with the cab company on a recall
of their entire fleet.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.265
- Excuse me.

21:13.310 --> 21:16.529
- Dr. Jed Arthur. I was asked
to come and speak to
a detective Nolan.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.959
- This is the therapist that
Tanya referred Chris Henley to.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.228
Zoe looked it up.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.225
- Uhhh, thanks
for coming in, Doctor.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.236
What can you tell us
about Chris Henley?

21:25.280 --> 21:27.407
- I can tell you
that he's a patient of mine,

21:27.460 --> 21:29.234
and that he didn't show up
for his appointment today.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.453
But beyond that, I'm...

21:31.500 --> 21:33.456
bound by confidentiality.
- I can tell you

21:33.500 --> 21:35.195
why he missed
his appointment today, Doctor.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.195
- Mr. Henley is wanted
for questioning

21:37.250 --> 21:38.979
in connection with the murder
of Tanya Poponov.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.248
Tanya?!

21:41.300 --> 21:44.110
- I'm afraid so.

21:44.170 --> 21:48.072
- I've, uh... I've
known her for 15 years.

21:48.130 --> 21:50.826
- I'm sorry you had
to find out like this.

21:50.870 --> 21:53.953
: Right now,
he's our prime suspect.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.391
- You don't seem
entirely surprised.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.739
- No, I am. His recovery
was well underway.

22:01.790 --> 22:04.099
Chris would never do
anything like this.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.105
- Lay out what happened today,
from the beginning.

22:09.150 --> 22:11.664
- All I know is
I got a text from Tanya

22:11.720 --> 22:14.541
telling me to meet her
at her hotel room right away.

22:14.590 --> 22:18.060
- No, never.

22:18.110 --> 22:20.283
- So what happened
when you arrived?

22:20.330 --> 22:22.764
- I noticed the door
was open slightly.

22:22.810 --> 22:25.722
But I still knocked.
And then I called out for her,

22:25.770 --> 22:28.330
but I didn't get an answer,
so I... you know,

22:28.390 --> 22:30.733
I just opened the door
and went in.

22:30.780 --> 22:34.250
And that's when I... it's
when I saw her on the floor.

22:37.090 --> 22:40.082
I took out my phone to call
the police, but then I stopped.

22:40.140 --> 22:42.654
- Because of the way things were

22:42.700 --> 22:44.918
between Tanya and me,

22:44.970 --> 22:48.576
I don't know, my gut...
my gut was screaming at me

22:48.620 --> 22:51.703
that that text
and then walking in on her

22:51.760 --> 22:54.365
on the ground like that,
that that was no coincidence.

22:54.410 --> 22:56.275
- You thought
you were being framed.

22:56.330 --> 22:59.970
- Yeah, yeah. And then
I panicked. I freaked out.
I didn't know what to do.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.498
I picked up the gun and I ran
out of there as fast as I could.

23:02.550 --> 23:04.677
- You picked up
the murder weapon?!

23:04.730 --> 23:06.413
- I don't know.
All I could think about was how

23:06.470 --> 23:08.506
whoever set me up, they probably
put my fingerprints

23:08.560 --> 23:10.858
all over the gun.
Wasn't gonna leave it there.

23:10.910 --> 23:14.471
Ah! I've never been framed
for murder before,

23:14.520 --> 23:16.909
it was my first time, and
it doesn't come with a manual.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.520
- What did you mean

23:19.570 --> 23:22.607
"the way things were
between you and Tanya"?

23:22.660 --> 23:26.175
- Thanks, Tammy.
Chris Henley's rap sheet.

23:26.230 --> 23:30.007
Ohh! Seems your model patient
was no stranger to police.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.665
I'm looking at multiple arrests,
all for disorderly conduct,

23:32.710 --> 23:35.793
all in the past three years.
- Because of confidentiality,

23:35.840 --> 23:38.058
I'm unable to comment,
but rest assured,

23:38.110 --> 23:40.624
the reasons are... complex.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.978
- He seems like he settled down
lately, but, uh, kind of

23:43.030 --> 23:44.975
makes you wonder what set him
off in the first place.

23:45.030 --> 23:46.895
- Please, Doctor.
One person is already dead,

23:46.940 --> 23:50.068
and my partner could be next.
What happened three years ago?

23:51.690 --> 23:53.464
- Chris Henley's wife
passed away.

23:55.210 --> 23:58.816
- After she was gone,
nothing made sense.

23:58.870 --> 24:01.691
I totally disconnected
from... from everything,

24:01.740 --> 24:05.085
from everyone,
including my daughter.

24:05.130 --> 24:07.519
Then there were times I didn't
think I was gonna make it

24:07.570 --> 24:09.788
through it all.

24:09.830 --> 24:12.003
- So I started seeing Tan...

24:12.050 --> 24:14.575
Dr. Poponov.

24:14.620 --> 24:18.010
Oh, and... everything started
to get better.

24:18.060 --> 24:21.450
You know, she helped me.
She helped me reconnect,

24:21.500 --> 24:24.492
and she helped me
start feeling again.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.677
And what I felt
was this...

24:26.720 --> 24:29.325
like an intense gratitude
towards her.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.116
During one of my sessions,

24:34.160 --> 24:35.980
I looked her right in the eye,
I told her I loved her.

24:38.170 --> 24:40.638
She smiled back at me.

24:40.690 --> 24:43.420
She said,
"That's called transference."

24:43.480 --> 24:46.176
- Tanya recommended Chris to me

24:46.220 --> 24:49.860
because she was concerned he had
developed an inappropriate
attachment to her.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.138
I've known her for years;
I was happy to help out.

24:52.180 --> 24:55.047
- I can't get into specifics,

24:55.100 --> 24:57.352
_ but it was clear to me
his pathology around Tanya

24:57.400 --> 24:58.924
had solidified.
- Can you give that to us

24:58.970 --> 25:02.189
in English, please, Doctor?
- He had it bad for her.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.846
But we embarked
on an aggresswe

25:04.890 --> 25:07.529
therapeutic approach, and I felt
we were making progress.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.764
- Nolan. Yeah. Got it.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.801
Thanks.
: What is it?

25:12.850 --> 25:14.852
- We just got a positive ID
from the maid

25:14.900 --> 25:16.856
who saw the suspect
leave Tanya's room.

25:16.900 --> 25:19.118
She's 100% percent certain
it was Chris Henley.

25:21.170 --> 25:23.126
: Uh-oh.

25:23.170 --> 25:25.559
We better get off the road.
: Why?

25:25.610 --> 25:29.125
- I think Beck called
all its cabs back.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.126
Pretty soon,
we're gonna be

25:31.180 --> 25:33.171
the only orange and green car
on the road.

25:37.180 --> 25:39.136
OK. First thing
we have to do

25:39.180 --> 25:41.444
is make a suspect list.

25:41.490 --> 25:43.799
Who hated Tanya enough
to murder her and try to pin it

25:43.840 --> 25:45.660
on you?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.575
- Stuart Poponov.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.848
- It's Tanya's husband.

25:49.890 --> 25:51.801
Yeah, they were going
through this really ugly divorce

25:51.850 --> 25:54.546
and then the few times
that I saw Stuart at her office,

25:54.590 --> 25:56.455
he seemed really hostile.
- Huh.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.499
OK. Alright. Umm,

26:01.560 --> 26:03.369
I know a place
where we can be safe,

26:03.430 --> 26:05.466
but... I need to

26:05.520 --> 26:07.681
get in touch with my partner.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.163
And in the interest
of full disclosure,

26:10.220 --> 26:13.599
I have a confession
to make.

26:13.650 --> 26:15.652
- Why am I suddenly
gripping the gun tighter?

26:15.700 --> 26:17.600
- There's a microphone

26:17.660 --> 26:19.434
hidden behind
the rearview mirror.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.092
- Then somebody's been
listening to everything?
- Yeah.

26:26.060 --> 26:27.402
You trust me?

26:29.800 --> 26:33.145
- What other choice
do I have? Yeah.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.930
: Angie, Zoe,
I hope you guys can hear me.

26:35.980 --> 26:38.448
Listen, I need to meet you
right away

26:38.500 --> 26:40.456
at my dad's
favourite restaurant.

26:40.510 --> 26:42.375
Call ahead
and book a private table.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.024
Completely private,
do you understand?

26:46.210 --> 26:48.644
- We'll be in touch if we need
anything else, Doctor.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.420
- Thanks for coming,
and this wasn't your fault.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.210
- Doctor, hang on a second.

26:53.260 --> 26:54.648
This just came
from the crime scene.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.998
Prescription glasses
found under Tanya's bed.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.348
They're gonna send it to the
lab, but I figured I'd ask.
They look familiar to you?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.618
- I can't be certain,

27:01.660 --> 27:04.174
but they do resemble Chris's.

27:04.230 --> 27:06.039
- Hey, Zoe.

27:06.100 --> 27:08.614
- I still don't understand

27:08.670 --> 27:10.615
any of this.
Our therapy was working.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.059
- Everybody misses one
now and then, Doctor.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.749
- We'll be in touch.

27:21.290 --> 27:23.508
- Why did I just get
a very bad feeling?

27:28.340 --> 27:30.296
- I got your message.
What is going on?

27:30.340 --> 27:32.160
- I'll explain later.
You have to go.

27:32.210 --> 27:34.166
: I'm fine, Shona.

27:34.210 --> 27:36.166
- OK. You go now.
Keep everyone

27:36.210 --> 27:38.735
out of here until I call you.
- OK.

27:38.780 --> 27:42.045
- Ang, this is--
- Chris Henley.
Yeah, I know all about him.

27:42.090 --> 27:45.617
- I... I didn't do
what they're saying.
- You were seen fleeing

27:45.660 --> 27:47.616
the hotel with the murder
weapon, you have a history

27:47.660 --> 27:49.616
with the victim,
and you left your glasses behind

27:49.660 --> 27:51.446
at the lscene.

27:51.490 --> 27:54.664
- Oh yeah. And best of all,
you took my partner
hostage at gunpoint!

27:54.710 --> 27:56.621
- Angie, relax. It's all good.
!

27:56.670 --> 27:58.888
- Just listen to me
for a second.

27:58.930 --> 28:01.319
I don't think Chris did this.
: Yeah.

28:01.370 --> 28:03.838
: Excuse me?
- I think he's being framed,

28:03.890 --> 28:06.279
and that Tanya's husband
is the one who killed her.

28:10.070 --> 28:12.630
- Nolan.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.681
Where?

28:14.730 --> 28:16.857
Alright, set up
a perimeter blockade.

28:16.910 --> 28:18.866
I'll be right there.

28:18.910 --> 28:22.255
- I tracked Everett's phone
to The Red Bird Diner.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.564
A green and orange taxi
showed up.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.299
- What were you doing
in her hotel room?

28:28.350 --> 28:30.352
- Yeah, Tanya sent him
a text message

28:30.400 --> 28:32.914
asking him to meet her there.

28:32.970 --> 28:35.962
- Uhhh...
he destroyed his phone.

28:36.010 --> 28:37.921
And mine.
- Sorry. That was...

28:37.970 --> 28:40.279
that was back when I was,
like, really... grrrr!

28:40.320 --> 28:42.276
- I was at the police station

28:42.320 --> 28:44.140
when they talked
to Tanya's husband.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.065
He painted
a pretty unflattering picture

28:46.110 --> 28:48.670
of your relationship with her.
- No. That's... that's not

28:48.720 --> 28:50.893
the way it is anymore, OK?
I've... I've let her go!

28:50.940 --> 28:54.285
- No. No, it took a long time.

28:54.340 --> 28:56.638
OK? Dr. Arthur, he gave me

28:56.690 --> 28:59.557
this new medication.
OK, Parcodum.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.556
Maybe I should
take one right now.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.079
- Mr. Henley, whether
you're guilty or innocent,

29:03.130 --> 29:05.473
you need to yourself in.
- No! Not until we figure out

29:05.520 --> 29:07.602
who's framing him.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.652
- Uhhh, yeah,

29:09.700 --> 29:12.954
I, ahem, took Chris on
as a client.

29:13.010 --> 29:15.649
- OK, this is either
the fastest case

29:15.710 --> 29:17.871
of Stockholm Syndrome
in history,

29:17.930 --> 29:19.830
or else you're just saying that
because he has a gun.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.365
- He gave that to me
before we walked in here.

29:25.410 --> 29:28.322
Look, Angie,

29:28.370 --> 29:30.930
we need your help.
The cab's out back,

29:30.980 --> 29:33.414
but we gotta keep moving,
and we need a plan.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.540
- Yeah. Ijust, uh...

29:37.600 --> 29:39.636
Sorry. I just need some water.

29:41.860 --> 29:44.294
- OK, fine.

29:44.340 --> 29:46.991
I'll help on one condition.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.167
- It's a range booster.
We need to be

29:49.220 --> 29:51.825
in two-way communication
at all times.

29:51.870 --> 29:54.828
Because if you're wrong,
you're getting back in
the cab with a killer.

30:00.530 --> 30:02.669
- Alright, everybody get ready.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.359
- Pull over!

30:14.420 --> 30:16.843
Get off the vehicle! Do it now!

30:16.900 --> 30:19.630
- Police! Don't move!
- Hands where I can see them!

30:19.680 --> 30:21.636
Right now!
- Police! Don't move!

30:21.680 --> 30:23.819
- Show me your hands!
- Leave 'em up there!

30:23.860 --> 30:26.647
- You are surrounded,
stay still!

30:32.700 --> 30:34.952
At this point in my shift,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.651
I just can't go any further west
than Yonge Street.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.521
- Dammit, Everett.

30:46.190 --> 30:48.704
- You're sure you didn't have
your glasses on when you went

30:48.750 --> 30:50.706
into the hotel room?
- Pretty sure.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.490
You're gonna
have to do better than that.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.496
- Honestly, I don't remember.

30:55.540 --> 30:57.496
OK, I get memory lapses.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.711
It's from the medication.

30:59.770 --> 31:02.375
I usually keep my glasses
in my pocket. I only use 'em

31:02.420 --> 31:05.241
for reading.
- Yeah, we're gonna
have to go back there.

31:05.290 --> 31:08.464
The hotel?!
- Somebody must have

31:08.510 --> 31:10.387
seen or heard something
that can help us.

31:10.430 --> 31:12.990
- Give me one reason
why we shouldn't arrest you

31:13.040 --> 31:14.905
right now for aiding
and abetting a fugitive?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.905
- I got an anonymous tip
that that cab was parked

31:16.960 --> 31:18.916
behind the diner,
and when I got there,

31:18.960 --> 31:21.178
Henley and Shade
were already gone.

31:21.220 --> 31:23.268
The owners of the diner
will corroborate that story.

31:23.310 --> 31:25.699
You mean Shade's father?

31:25.750 --> 31:28.184
- Not sure, I'll have to check.
- Come on,

31:28.230 --> 31:30.960
just give me a break!
- Look, when I got into the cab,

31:31.010 --> 31:34.229
I found this.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.714
- Which begs the question:
if this guy is guilty,

31:36.760 --> 31:38.842
then why would he leave that
behind for us?

31:38.890 --> 31:41.154
- Because he's trying to
manipulate you and your partner
into thinking he's innocent.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.191
And he's doing
a damn good job of it.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.936
- I'm taking this to ballistics.
- Alright.

31:45.990 --> 31:48.242
- Chris also said that--

31:48.290 --> 31:50.201
- That Tanya sent him
a text message

31:50.250 --> 31:52.855
asking him to meet her
at her hotel room.

31:52.910 --> 31:56.380
- Why would he lie about
something so easy to check?

31:56.430 --> 31:58.648
- We're still trying to unlock
Tanya's phone and when we do,

31:58.690 --> 32:01.386
we'll see if a text is on there.
- OK.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.341
In the meantime, I'm--
- No, in the meantime,
go home, Ang.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.265
And if you hear
from Shade again, you tell him

32:06.310 --> 32:08.266
he's dangerously close to being
an accessory after the fact

32:08.310 --> 32:10.961
on a murder. At which point,
neither you nor I can help him.

32:11.010 --> 32:14.184
- Nolan, wait. Didn't it seem
like Stuart Poponov

32:14.230 --> 32:16.141
was pointing us in the direction
of Tanya's ex-patients

32:16.190 --> 32:17.919
with a bit too much gusto?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.675
- Shade: [Angie, come in.
Angie, it's me.]

32:24.720 --> 32:27.029
]
- I'm here, go ahead.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.584
- We're heading back
to the Chamberlain Arms Hotel,

32:29.640 --> 32:31.596
see what we can find out
about the murder scene.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.596
You got any contacts there?
!]

32:33.640 --> 32:35.983
You wanna take a murder suspect
back to the scene of the crime?

32:36.040 --> 32:37.849
According to Nolan,
you're already one inch away

32:37.910 --> 32:40.071
from accessory after the fact.

32:40.130 --> 32:43.293
- [Chris said he put
Tanya behind him.]

32:43.350 --> 32:45.306
Maybe if I get the session
notes from his doctor,

32:45.350 --> 32:48.569
then we can prove that.

32:48.610 --> 32:51.078
- The concierge
at the Chamberlain Arms

32:51.140 --> 32:53.096
helped us
on this last infidelity case.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.701
I'll set up a meet. But, Shade,
if this doesn't pan out,

32:56.750 --> 32:58.798
you need to convince Chris
to turn himself in.

32:58.840 --> 33:02.059
- Understood.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.069
Stay here. I'll be right back.

33:10.110 --> 33:12.021
- Yeah.

33:22.260 --> 33:25.081
- Yeah. Thanks for doing this.
Listen, um, I wanted to ask you

33:25.130 --> 33:26.859
what the hotel grapevine
is saying about what happened

33:26.910 --> 33:29.299
to Tanya Poponov?
- Well, Angie and I have

33:29.350 --> 33:31.602
a very basic understanding.

33:31.660 --> 33:34.823
Money first, talk second.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.223
Come on. Alright.
Hold on. Hold on.

33:37.270 --> 33:41.058
Here, here. Hold on.
- This'll buy you two minutes.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.705
- So, what are people saying
about the murder?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.830
- Nothing the police
don't already know.

33:45.890 --> 33:47.972
Handful of noise complaints
came in around noon.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.589
- Some guests thought
it was a champagne cork,

33:51.630 --> 33:53.769
others thought
it was a TV on too loud.

33:53.810 --> 33:55.675
Then about a half hour later,
the guy was seen

33:55.720 --> 33:57.676
running from the room
by a cleaning woman.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.334
- A half hour after
the noise complaints?

33:59.380 --> 34:02.167
- Give or take.
Tick tock.

34:02.210 --> 34:05.259
- Uh, do you have time-stamped
cameras at the hotel?

34:05.300 --> 34:07.291
- Only at the front door
and the lobby.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.082
Our guests like
their privacy. We done?

34:10.130 --> 34:12.644
- Yeah. Thanks.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.171
- Miss Everett,
what can I do for you?

34:19.230 --> 34:21.095
- I had a favour...

34:21.140 --> 34:23.927
Chris said that Tanya sent him
a text message asking him

34:23.970 --> 34:26.404
to meet her in her room.

34:26.450 --> 34:28.759
- Yeah, my partner
convinced him to meet with me.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.756
Do you have
any idea why Tanya

34:30.800 --> 34:33.325
would do that?
- I can't imagine.

34:33.370 --> 34:35.326
She'd gone to great pains to
break off all contact with him.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.975
- Yeah. That's what he said.

34:38.030 --> 34:39.713
He also said that new drug
that you prescribed him -

34:39.770 --> 34:41.726
Parcodum - was helping him
move past her

34:41.770 --> 34:43.761
as well.
- Yes, it was.

34:43.820 --> 34:46.118
- Look, I know
it's a huge ask,

34:46.170 --> 34:48.206
but if I could just get
a copy of Chris's session notes

34:48.260 --> 34:50.603
with you, it would
really help in establishing

34:50.650 --> 34:53.255
that he wasn't in the frame
of mind to murder her.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.470
- Maybe.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.873
- Look, it's illegal for me

34:59.920 --> 35:01.694
to give you those session notes
without a court order.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.706
- I know.

35:03.750 --> 35:07.129
I'm no expert,
but if one of your patients

35:07.190 --> 35:09.181
were to be charged with murder,

35:09.230 --> 35:11.539
that would not be good
for business, right?

35:13.500 --> 35:16.196
- OK. Just... I'll be a minute.

35:23.030 --> 35:25.851
- How long were you actually
in the hotel room?

35:25.900 --> 35:27.811
- Probably less than a minute.
- And you went

35:27.860 --> 35:29.725
to the hotel
through the front doors?

35:29.770 --> 35:31.909
- Yeah.
- Then the time stamps

35:31.950 --> 35:33.599
on the camera should show
that you entered the hotel

35:33.650 --> 35:35.424
long after the noise complaints
about the gunshot.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.904
- It's not a slam dunk.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.178
You're still the only person
that was seen leaving the hotel

35:41.220 --> 35:43.472
with the murder weapon.
We need to figure out

35:43.530 --> 35:47.045
how Tanya's husband
got ahold of your glasses.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.874
Have you had a break-in
lately or...?

35:50.750 --> 35:53.401
What is it?
- I just remembered

35:53.450 --> 35:55.759
where I last had my glasses.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.765
- Chris left his glasses
at Dr. Arthur's office.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.766
He swears it's the last time
he saw them.

36:07.810 --> 36:09.949
- Uh, I'm here now.

36:09.990 --> 36:13.118
]
- At Dr. Arthur's.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.559
Did you know that he's getting
a kickback for Parcodum?

36:20.260 --> 36:23.514
Angie, you still there?

36:46.720 --> 36:48.540
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hands up!
- Hold on! Hold on!

36:48.590 --> 36:51.241
- Whoa! Whoa!
Guys! Guys! Guys, listen.

36:51.290 --> 36:53.758
Dr. Arthur has Angie.
!

36:53.820 --> 36:55.378
- Cuff him.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.666
Angie, come in.

37:27.330 --> 37:30.197
Is that Lakeshore?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.583
- They're driving on Lakeshore.

37:35.990 --> 37:38.072
- I have more sedatives.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.941
You won't even be
awake for it.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.865
: Don River.

37:46.910 --> 37:49.378
- Don River!
- Near the Port Lands.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.863
- Let's go!
- Hey, Brian,

37:51.920 --> 37:54.559
get this guy into holding.

37:57.010 --> 37:58.659
- Calling all units.
Calling all units

38:08.370 --> 38:10.270
Tanya?

38:10.330 --> 38:13.800
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Nothing spoils

38:13.850 --> 38:15.545
a leisurely drive
through the city

38:15.590 --> 38:17.546
like uncomfortable silence.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.500
- Let's just say
it was a difference

38:21.560 --> 38:23.164
of professional opinion.

38:23.210 --> 38:24.370
- She didn't like that you were

38:24.430 --> 38:26.898
getting paid out
by a pharmaceutical company?

38:26.950 --> 38:29.384
[Yeah, I saw the papers
on Parcodum.]

38:29.430 --> 38:31.159
[I mean, they were paying you
to prescribe it, weren't they

38:31.220 --> 38:34.257
Or is it more?

38:34.310 --> 38:36.084
Is it dangerous?

38:36.130 --> 38:38.269
- Parcodum is safe,
and after I publish

38:38.310 --> 38:40.778
my findings, the health
authority will agree with me.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.616
- Except Chris doesn't
know that he's being
experimented on, does he?

38:45.580 --> 38:48.185
That's what Tanya found out.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.539
That you're using Chris
as a human guinea pig

38:50.580 --> 38:52.923
so you can fast-track
approval of the drug.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.754
- I _didn't ask her
to reVIew my research,

38:54.810 --> 38:56.801
but... she was relentless.

38:58.770 --> 39:02.934
- So you killed her.
- I didn't have a choice.

39:02.990 --> 39:05.720
She was gonna report me
to the Psychiatric Association.

39:07.340 --> 39:10.127
- It's one heck of a plan, Doc.

39:10.170 --> 39:12.946
Aren't they just gonna trace
the drugs back to you anyway?

39:15.260 --> 39:19.173
- I've never prescribed Parcodum
in my entire life.

39:19.220 --> 39:22.747
- Wow, your patients
are so lucky to have you.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.185
Cherry Street Bridge.

39:32.230 --> 39:34.846
- Cherry Street Bridge!

39:34.890 --> 39:37.108
- All units, be advised.
The suspect is heading south

39:37.150 --> 39:39.584
on the Cherry Street Bridge.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.635
Shade, please hurry.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.591
- Cold night for a swim,

40:28.640 --> 40:30.505
but you won't feel a thing.

40:30.550 --> 40:32.768
Ugh! Argh!

40:32.820 --> 40:34.594
Angie?

40:34.640 --> 40:37.074
- They're fighting.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.521
There!

41:08.110 --> 41:11.455
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Hands where I can see 'em!

41:11.510 --> 41:13.978
- Yeah.

41:14.030 --> 41:16.419
- Yeah. I would hug you,

41:16.470 --> 41:18.643
but I'm a little tied up
at the moment.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.385
: Do you got
something to cut this off?

41:20.430 --> 41:22.295
- Yeah, always.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.916
Don't say I never did
nothing for you.

41:35.230 --> 41:37.448
[song Hold What You Can
by Amy Stroup]

41:37.490 --> 41:40.539
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Just the fact that you're
not pointing

41:40.580 --> 41:43.754
a gun at me is thanks enough.
- Right.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.530
- Better.

41:46.590 --> 41:48.273
Yeah. I'm off the drugs.

41:48.330 --> 41:51.629
I'm back to straight-up therapy.
The pharmaceutical company

41:51.680 --> 41:53.545
is offering
a substantial settlement

41:53.590 --> 41:57.378
to avoid a lawsuit.

41:57.420 --> 42:00.719
- They've asked me
to testify at his trial.

42:00.770 --> 42:03.238
- Yeah.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.256
Yeah, when the times comes,
I'll be ready.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.167
Shadow, I got you something.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.952
Yeah! There you go.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.264
It's the same model
as your old one.

42:15.310 --> 42:17.528
This one has
a shatter-proof screen guard.

42:17.570 --> 42:19.356
You go at that
with a hammer.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.186
- Wish I had thought
of that before.

42:21.230 --> 42:22.879
Thank you.

42:22.930 --> 42:25.182
- Yeah.

42:25.230 --> 42:27.448
- Actually, uh,

42:27.500 --> 42:31.539
I got you something too.
- When the night won't end

42:31.590 --> 42:33.546
When the ground caves in

42:35.680 --> 42:38.854
- Hold what you can
- Oh, my God!

42:38.900 --> 42:40.765
So good to see you.

42:47.820 --> 42:50.607
Uh, just a second.
: Thank you.

42:53.300 --> 42:56.087
How are you doing?

42:56.130 --> 42:58.132
How... how is school?

43:02.620 --> 43:06.579
- Our time is short
- Mmm! Oh yeah, he'll be fine.

43:06.620 --> 43:08.793
He just needed a fresh start.
- And over soon

43:08.840 --> 43:12.492
- Oh, crap! I gotta go.
- Saying new words
with weight

43:12.540 --> 43:15.270
- I'm meeting Jules later.
We're gonna see a horror movie.

43:15.330 --> 43:17.753
- No, I'll just take a cab--

43:20.110 --> 43:22.670
On second thought,
it's a lovely day,

43:22.730 --> 43:24.891
I think maybe I'll take a walk.

43:24.950 --> 43:28.374
- When the air gets thin

43:28.430 --> 43:30.204
- Of course.

43:30.250 --> 43:35.995
- When the night won't end

43:36.040 --> 43:40.124
When the ground caves in

43:40.180 --> 43:42.910
Hold what you can

43:45.790 --> 43:48.657
Sawdust and ashes

43:48.710 --> 43:51.577
Fall down

43:51.620 --> 43:53.531
Catching the light

43:53.580 --> 43:55.969
They've found

43:56.020 --> 44:00.013
Better look closely
