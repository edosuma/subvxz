00:07.001 --> 00:10.336
Diane, are you ready?
lt's time for ''The Sorrow And The Pity''.

00:10.505 --> 00:13.957
Are you two going straight home to bed?

00:14.135 --> 00:16.174
You know it's a movie.

00:16.344 --> 00:21.933
Not just a movie. lt's the final feature
in the Human Brutality Film Festival.

00:22.102 --> 00:25.802
Sammy, when's the Coach
back from visiting his sister?

00:25.981 --> 00:31.401
- He'll be in Minnesota another week.
- ls his sister anything like the Coach?

00:31.569 --> 00:36.196
Let me put it this way. He asked her
to pick him up at the airport.

00:36.367 --> 00:42.370
She thought he meant the Boston airport
so she drove here to pick him up.

00:42.541 --> 00:48.958
Fortunately, that's what he meant.
They had lunch at the airport.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.918
Then they drove on to St. Paul.

00:53.176 --> 00:56.426
l thought she lived in Duluth.

00:56.596 --> 01:01.010
She does, but they don't like the food
at the airport in Duluth.

01:01.894 --> 01:07.898
Actually, Coach will probably be back
before l could explain this to you.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

02:22.439 --> 02:26.389
Let's get out of here.
All the goofs have gone home.

02:26.569 --> 02:30.816
Nobody to laugh at or buy us beer.
l think our work here is done.

02:30.990 --> 02:33.279
Amen.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.075
ls that Carla's positively-disgusting
ex-husband Nick?

02:42.252 --> 02:45.621
All right. Things are picking up, Cliffie.
Have a seat.

02:48.050 --> 02:52.628
Hello, blondie. l bet you thought
you'd never see me again, right?

02:52.804 --> 02:58.760
Change ''thought'' to ''begged God''
and you've got it exactly.

02:58.937 --> 03:01.807
- Hey, Nick.
- Hello, Sam.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.688
And the rest of you.

03:04.859 --> 03:09.569
lt's so good to see some friendly faces.
My, can l use that now.

03:10.658 --> 03:14.358
- ls something wrong?
- Yeah, but let's not dwell on it.

03:14.536 --> 03:18.486
lt would tear your heart out.
ls Carla around?

03:18.666 --> 03:22.711
- No, she went home for the night.
- Frasier, your tea is ready.

03:22.878 --> 03:28.882
Nick Tortelli, this is someone with whom
you have absolutely nothing in common,

03:29.052 --> 03:31.259
my paramour, Doctor Frasier Crane.

03:31.430 --> 03:34.964
Doctor of what? Can you get any pills?

03:36.059 --> 03:39.310
l'm a psychiatrist. Have we met?

03:39.480 --> 03:44.357
Are you the bogus missing link exhibited
at the Amsterdam World's Fair?

03:44.528 --> 03:48.822
No, but you're not the first person
who asked me.

03:48.990 --> 03:53.487
l wish l had done that. Maybe my life
would be worth something.

03:53.662 --> 03:57.909
What's going on here?
What's the matter, Nick?

03:58.084 --> 04:01.453
- You remember my wife, Loretta?
- Sure do. Tall. Blonde.

04:01.629 --> 04:04.880
She ran out on me.
She always wanted to be a singer.

04:05.049 --> 04:09.000
She got an offer from this big
musical group that's touring the country.

04:09.179 --> 04:11.218
The Grinning Americans.

04:11.389 --> 04:13.429
The grinning what?

04:13.601 --> 04:15.925
They're wholesome young people,

04:16.103 --> 04:19.353
who wear pullover sweaters,
sing patriotic songs.

04:19.522 --> 04:22.524
They've had me and Ma marching
around the living room

04:22.693 --> 04:25.398
on more than one Sunday afternoon.

04:25.571 --> 04:29.356
You live with your mother, Cliff?

04:29.534 --> 04:32.784
l have my own room.
l have my own hot plate.

04:32.954 --> 04:36.370
You want to read
something sicko into that?

04:38.127 --> 04:41.911
- You're not the first to lose a woman.
- You haven't heard the worst.

04:42.089 --> 04:45.873
Loretta wouldn't marry me unless
l signed a pre-nuptial agreement

04:46.051 --> 04:48.092
and put everything in her name.

04:48.263 --> 04:50.670
l was up to my eyeballs
in <i>amore</i> that night.

04:50.849 --> 04:54.099
She got the house
and the Tortelli Television Hospital.

04:54.269 --> 04:57.518
- Let me get you a drink.
- l don't have anything.

04:57.689 --> 05:00.015
- l couldn't pay.
- lt's on the house.

05:00.193 --> 05:06.194
Nick Tortelli don't take charity or pity,
or soda. So make it neat, Sam.

05:07.825 --> 05:11.740
l forgot my purse. Nick.

05:13.207 --> 05:17.453
- What the hell are you doing here?
- l came to see if l have any friends left.

05:17.627 --> 05:21.755
Sorry, our new snail pellets
took care of them.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.592
You look pretty, Carla.

05:28.848 --> 05:33.511
The twinkie left you, didn't she?
She took you for everything, didn't she?

05:33.686 --> 05:35.893
Tell me she took you for everything.

05:36.064 --> 05:40.393
l was born into this world naked
and so shall l leave it.

05:40.569 --> 05:44.103
Please stay fully-clothed
the rest of the time.

05:44.281 --> 05:46.321
You got a guy, Carla?

05:46.491 --> 05:49.279
No, l swallowed a beach ball.

05:49.454 --> 05:51.991
For your information,
l am not seeing anybody,

05:52.164 --> 05:56.459
but the guy that knocked me up and ran
this time is ten times classier than you.

05:56.628 --> 05:58.206
Get out.

05:58.379 --> 06:02.627
l have no reason to expect any kindness
from you. l treated you like dirt.

06:02.801 --> 06:05.292
But l've come back to start over again.

06:05.471 --> 06:10.465
l would like to make it up to you and
my children, if you give me a chance.

06:11.311 --> 06:16.018
l don't know what to say, Nick.
Part of me wants to laugh in your face.

06:16.189 --> 06:19.061
The rest of me wants to throw up.

06:20.153 --> 06:22.561
Go with your heart.

06:23.615 --> 06:26.402
Just how dumb do you think l am?

06:26.576 --> 06:29.114
She kicks you out
and you expect me to believe

06:29.287 --> 06:32.075
that you're a sweet guy
that wants to do right by me?

06:32.248 --> 06:34.870
What would it take to convince you?

06:35.044 --> 06:37.535
- Forget it.
- Wait.

06:43.469 --> 06:49.305
l'm going to hold my hand over this
flame until you believe my sincerity.

06:49.475 --> 06:53.722
Go ahead. l happen to be fond
of the smell of roast pig.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.268
Yuck, he's going to do it.

07:09.581 --> 07:13.414
Say you believe me and end my torment.

07:14.502 --> 07:18.999
Say, Nick, shouldn't you be putting it
a little closer down to the flame?

07:20.551 --> 07:23.172
What, are there rules to this?

07:24.221 --> 07:26.629
lt's plenty warm up here where it is.

07:27.600 --> 07:33.686
Nick, you're roach droppings.
l never want to see you again in my life.

07:40.781 --> 07:44.779
You're her friends.
You believe me, don't you?

07:44.952 --> 07:46.991
You'll talk to her, won't you?

07:47.163 --> 07:51.742
Diane, we've missed the Sorrow,
but maybe we can still catch the Pity.

07:51.917 --> 07:56.913
Mr Tortelli, l hate to see any human
suffer without doing something to help.

07:57.090 --> 08:01.337
l'd like you to call this number
any time, day or night.

08:01.512 --> 08:06.589
- ls this your office?
- No, l'm far out of your price range.

08:06.767 --> 08:10.101
This is the number of a promising
graduate student.

08:10.271 --> 08:12.346
You could put him on the map.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.945
- Good night, Sammy. Nick.
- See you later, Nick.

08:19.114 --> 08:22.697
You fellas going home
to your warm beds?

08:23.619 --> 08:26.240
Yup. That's where we're going.

08:28.498 --> 08:31.120
You got a place to sleep tonight,
don't you?

08:31.293 --> 08:37.212
- Yeah, in the gutter out front.
- Good. As long as you got a place.

08:39.844 --> 08:43.095
They say people don't get involved, Cliff.

08:44.974 --> 08:48.309
Nick, l'm afraid l'm going to have
to close up here.

08:48.478 --> 08:52.097
l know. Just one more thing, Sam, OK?

08:52.275 --> 08:55.940
Could l do a few odd jobs for you
for a few bucks?

08:56.112 --> 08:59.612
Boy, l really don't need anything, Nick.

08:59.783 --> 09:03.032
Sam, you don't understand.
l'll do anything.

09:03.202 --> 09:05.610
A man without a job isn't a man, Sam.

09:05.789 --> 09:09.657
l'll sweep, l'll clean, l'll get on my knees
and scrub the place.

09:09.835 --> 09:12.706
The place will be spotless, Sam. Please

09:16.300 --> 09:18.922
Sam, thank you.

09:19.094 --> 09:22.629
Thank you. God bless you, Sam.

09:24.476 --> 09:29.387
- The broom's in the closet.
- Tonight?

09:29.564 --> 09:32.399
That's a little short notice.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.608
l'll do it.

09:45.957 --> 09:49.658
Hello, Miss Carla.
You're looking mighty pretty today.

09:49.836 --> 09:54.795
- But that railing looks terrible.
- Terrible? l can see my face in it.

09:54.967 --> 09:57.588
That's what l mean. So can l.

10:01.015 --> 10:04.264
l told you, if he's bothering you,
l'll get rid of him.

10:04.435 --> 10:08.978
l don't care what he does.
l enjoy seeing him grovel around.

10:12.902 --> 10:17.149
Carla, God knows
l was as sceptical as you are,

10:17.323 --> 10:21.986
but the man has been working here
for three weeks.

10:22.162 --> 10:27.122
He's rented a room with a sink.
He's joined a Christian support group.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.247
He's teaching himself
to play the harmonica.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.506
lsn't it possible that he's changed?

10:34.675 --> 10:39.920
He's also clipped his fingernails and he's
talked about subscribing to a magazine.

10:40.099 --> 10:45.685
But you look beyond the glitter and flash,
that's the same old Nick.

10:45.855 --> 10:49.106
He's doing this to impress me,
so l'll take him back.

10:49.275 --> 10:52.193
ls that such a bad idea? l'm just asking.

10:52.362 --> 10:56.941
He may be starting to pull the wool over
your eyes, but he's not doing it to me.

10:57.117 --> 11:00.533
lf l take him back, l'll end up getting hurt.

11:00.705 --> 11:03.788
l won't be the one to argue his case,

11:03.957 --> 11:08.750
but in the interest of human charity,
perhaps you should keep an open mind.

11:08.921 --> 11:10.997
ln the interest of human charity,

11:11.173 --> 11:14.507
l wouldn't walk across the room
to spit on his shoes.

11:16.095 --> 11:20.889
Pardon me, common scrub person,
is there a Nick Tortelli here?

11:21.060 --> 11:25.140
- Loretta.
- Nick, is that you?

11:25.314 --> 11:28.897
No, it's the Archbishop of Canterbury.

11:29.068 --> 11:33.066
- So you couldn't stay away from me?
- The very idea is ludicrous.

11:33.239 --> 11:37.985
We've simply outgrown each other.
l'm living in the fast lane now.

11:38.161 --> 11:41.862
l hobnob with people
you wouldn't even feel comfortable with.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.827
Last night l met a head waiter.

11:46.754 --> 11:49.671
So you came to rub my nose in it, right?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.879
Hi, gang at Cheers.

11:52.050 --> 11:56.879
Just because l've given Nick the boot
doesn't mean that we can't be friends.

11:57.056 --> 12:01.350
Especially you, Carla. After all,
we did have Nick Tortelli in common.

12:01.519 --> 12:05.767
Yeah, you, me and 1 ,000 head lice.

12:07.276 --> 12:10.644
- What are you doing here?
- These are the divorce papers.

12:10.821 --> 12:15.234
Read them and sign them.
And please, let's not make this sticky.

12:15.409 --> 12:19.656
lf you think l'm going to give you any
argument about this, you're nuts.

12:19.873 --> 12:24.120
l'm over you, Loretta.
Carla won't give me the time of day yet,

12:24.294 --> 12:28.541
but l'd rather be scrubbing the floor
that she walks on,

12:28.716 --> 12:31.337
than scrubbing the floor that you walk on.

12:31.510 --> 12:34.047
That wasn't too good,
but you get the picture.

12:36.432 --> 12:39.386
l'm glad to hear
that you're over me, Nick,

12:39.561 --> 12:44.187
because as far as l'm concerned,
you're yesterday's newspapers.

12:47.652 --> 12:50.059
Well, goodbye, gang at Cheers.

12:50.238 --> 12:53.739
l'm sorry you had to witness
this ugly scene.

12:54.951 --> 12:57.194
Beat it!

12:58.163 --> 13:03.121
And that, Carla, if you'll excuse me
for ending a sentence in a preposition,

13:03.293 --> 13:08.669
is a man whose shoes you wouldn't
cross the room to spit upon.

13:08.841 --> 13:12.092
What can l say, Diane? l was wrong.

13:26.653 --> 13:28.729
lt's a start.

13:32.241 --> 13:36.156
- May l take your coat, Miss Carla?
- Knock it off, Nick.

13:36.329 --> 13:38.322
Please, for me.

13:38.499 --> 13:43.872
Shame on me. This coat rack needs
to be sanded down and varnished.

13:45.046 --> 13:49.709
- So you and Nick took the kids out?
- Yeah. lt was Nick's idea.

13:49.885 --> 13:53.800
We took them to the petting zoo,
so they could slap the animals.

13:55.851 --> 14:01.854
Listen, tonight after work, me and you,
what do you say, like the old times?

14:02.024 --> 14:06.022
We'll go to the White Castle,
get burgers and catch some wrestling?

14:06.195 --> 14:08.519
There's a couple of grudge matches.

14:08.697 --> 14:14.154
Forget it. l'd enjoy that with a classy guy,
but you and l aren't happening.

14:14.954 --> 14:18.999
Carla, what do l have to do?
Don't you believe that people change?

14:19.167 --> 14:24.755
You hit rock bottom, then you've got to
change or there's no living with yourself.

14:24.924 --> 14:29.170
Sam understands that.
He was a stinking drunk.

14:29.344 --> 14:32.512
l had a problem, Nick.

14:34.558 --> 14:37.808
Miss Diane understands.
She's hustling hooch now.

14:37.978 --> 14:43.221
lt wasn't too long ago she was strapped
to a bed in the drooling academy.

14:46.654 --> 14:51.282
lt was only once that l was restrained
to my bed for my own safety

14:51.452 --> 14:54.369
when psychotropic drugs
affected my balance.

14:54.538 --> 14:58.239
That was only for a week and a half,
l was told.

14:59.460 --> 15:02.876
Anyway,
what are we talking about me for?

15:03.047 --> 15:05.919
Carla, why will you not relent?

15:06.093 --> 15:09.544
Because l don't believe you have it
in you to be true to me.

15:09.721 --> 15:12.722
lf Loretta came back,
you would go to her.

15:12.891 --> 15:17.435
You're going to believe me one day
and l'm going to hang in until you do.

15:17.605 --> 15:24.521
lf you'll excuse me, l have to finish oiling
the coasters on Sam's office chair.

15:24.696 --> 15:27.187
Fixing the big wheel's little wheels.

15:27.365 --> 15:30.117
l appreciate it, Nick.

15:30.285 --> 15:37.248
Carla, Cliff and l took alley-oop there
to the drive-in over the weekend.

15:37.418 --> 15:41.001
All he could talk about was you.
Miss Carla this. Miss Carla that.

15:41.172 --> 15:46.843
l am tired of hearing all of you
defending that walking hairball.

15:48.846 --> 15:52.346
You want to see
why l don't fall for his act?

15:52.517 --> 15:55.139
OK, watch.

15:55.312 --> 15:57.684
What's the extension in your office?

15:57.856 --> 16:00.477
Two...two, one.

16:04.322 --> 16:08.237
Nick? This is Loretta.

16:08.410 --> 16:13.403
l've been getting some of those old
feelings again, daddy.

16:13.581 --> 16:16.618
l think we should get together and talk.

16:16.794 --> 16:19.201
l'm at the Baldwin Hotel.

16:19.379 --> 16:25.999
- How soon could you come over...?
- l've got to get some cigarettes.

16:26.178 --> 16:30.426
- You don't smoke.
- l'm going to start. l heard good things.

16:36.231 --> 16:41.107
No. l'm not going to go.

16:41.278 --> 16:43.899
You know where l was going?

16:44.072 --> 16:49.364
Loretta called me and she wanted to talk
to me. And l was about to go.

16:49.538 --> 16:51.779
Then you know what happened?

16:51.956 --> 16:55.906
l thought of you
and l came to my senses.

16:58.629 --> 17:02.793
That wasn't Loretta, Nick.
That was Carla on the phone.

17:06.472 --> 17:09.557
- That was you?
- Yes, daddy.

17:11.394 --> 17:15.343
That was a test
and l passed with flying colours.

17:15.522 --> 17:18.145
Now do you believe me?

17:20.028 --> 17:22.650
Carla, how can you stand there

17:22.823 --> 17:27.449
and deny the man burgers and wrestling
with the woman he loves?

17:28.704 --> 17:32.702
- He knew it was me on the phone.
- Carla, what more can l do?

17:32.875 --> 17:35.331
That wasn't a good enough test.

17:36.837 --> 17:41.714
Hi, Carla. Hi, Nick.
Hi, gang at Cheers.

17:43.053 --> 17:46.007
- The real Loretta.
- Surprise.

17:46.181 --> 17:49.716
- What do you want?
- l want you back.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.098
What?

17:52.271 --> 17:57.562
Well, this isn't easy to say
and l don't know what song it's from,

17:57.735 --> 18:04.154
but there's a line in some song that
goes, ''l've got you under my skin.''

18:04.326 --> 18:06.615
l've Got You Under My Skin, Loretta.

18:06.786 --> 18:11.449
What?
No, this is going to complicate things.

18:13.919 --> 18:17.335
No, l was just telling you
the name of the song.

18:17.506 --> 18:20.461
Pardon me.

18:20.635 --> 18:23.256
Nick, what l'm trying to say is,

18:23.429 --> 18:27.677
do you think there's ever a chance
that we'll get back together again?

18:27.851 --> 18:30.056
ln my heart l knew this day would come.

18:30.228 --> 18:35.436
The other day when l was here with the
papers, something stirred inside of me.

18:35.609 --> 18:38.859
Back at the hotel room,
all l could think about is the way

18:39.029 --> 18:43.988
you used to make me pour Amaretto
in your chin dimple so l could sip it out.

18:45.078 --> 18:48.328
l've got so much to learn from this man.

18:51.501 --> 18:57.505
Loretta, l don't feel anything for you
any more. You hear me? Nothing.

18:57.674 --> 19:00.166
But you said you'd always love me.

19:00.344 --> 19:03.049
l'm a complex guy.

19:06.309 --> 19:11.552
You can say no to my words,
but can you say no to this?

19:11.731 --> 19:15.431
l've got another one
where this came from.

19:16.527 --> 19:19.897
You're making a fool out of yourself.
Beat it.

19:23.910 --> 19:29.452
This is one American who's going to
have trouble grinning on stage tonight.

19:32.003 --> 19:35.124
Bravo.

19:36.257 --> 19:40.208
Well, l have some oiling to complete.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.186
ln God's name, what more do you want?

19:48.355 --> 19:54.392
lt is the most startling metamorphoses
one man has ever undergone.

19:56.071 --> 20:00.318
You're all experts on Nick Tortelli?

20:01.284 --> 20:04.535
You all think l should go back with him?

20:04.705 --> 20:08.751
Not me. l don't think
you're good enough for him.

20:12.797 --> 20:15.502
OK.

20:15.675 --> 20:21.132
l'm going to take him back.
You all watch what's going happen.

20:30.774 --> 20:36.280
- Nick, can l speak to you?
- Yes, Miss Carla.

20:43.622 --> 20:47.869
Nick, l want you back.

20:48.043 --> 20:52.788
l want to give you another chance
to take care of me and the kids.

20:52.965 --> 20:56.132
Carla, you've made me
the happiest man on Earth.

20:56.302 --> 20:59.552
Let's go to White Castle and celebrate!

20:59.721 --> 21:05.263
l knew l'd get you back if l kept mopping
and cleaning the ashtrays and believing.

21:05.437 --> 21:09.269
But l've got to tell you,
that last test was the hardest.

21:09.441 --> 21:11.481
Test, Nick?

21:11.651 --> 21:15.353
The way you actually got Loretta
to come here and do what she did.

21:15.532 --> 21:17.939
l don't know how you did it.

21:20.494 --> 21:22.654
lt wasn't a test, Nick.

21:25.124 --> 21:28.126
- lt wasn't?
- No.

21:28.294 --> 21:32.791
- She really wants me back?
- That's right.

21:36.595 --> 21:40.972
Well, good. l'm glad to see
that you're above that sort of thing.

21:41.141 --> 21:46.682
lt's you and me...forever.

21:49.149 --> 21:53.195
Really, Nick? l can't believe it.

21:57.701 --> 22:00.407
What's the matter?

22:00.580 --> 22:05.158
l don't know. Something weird, Carla.

22:05.334 --> 22:07.742
l can't control my body.

22:08.797 --> 22:11.714
l don't know what's going on.

22:11.883 --> 22:16.047
l'm going to find a cure for this,
if it kills me.

22:16.221 --> 22:19.425
Goodbye, Carla. l love you.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.842
Loretta!

22:28.943 --> 22:35.563
On the way over to the bar this morning,
l saw this amazing cloud formation.

22:35.741 --> 22:38.992
lt looked like a flock of sheep.
lt was really...

22:39.162 --> 22:44.786
Satisfied? You're all ignorant.

22:48.381 --> 22:54.337
Carla, l'm sorry.
l don't know what to say.

22:55.262 --> 22:58.181
We made a terrible mistake.

22:59.142 --> 23:03.520
But our regret is tempered
by our pride in you.

23:03.688 --> 23:06.773
You didn't fall for him. You didn't give in.

23:06.943 --> 23:10.062
You stayed strong
and you came out on top.

23:10.238 --> 23:13.772
This is your day, Carla. Rejoice.

23:17.537 --> 23:23.291
Yeah, this is my day,
except for one thing.

23:23.461 --> 23:27.375
l love the monkey more now
than l ever did.

23:27.548 --> 23:29.456
That monkey?

23:31.135 --> 23:33.673
lt's crazy, isn't it?

23:37.015 --> 23:41.263
l don't think it is. Listen to me.

23:41.437 --> 23:46.812
What you're feeling right now for Nick,
every woman has felt it sometime.

23:46.985 --> 23:51.612
We all fall for some guy
that we know isn't good for us.

23:51.782 --> 23:57.121
We need excitement.
We need a walk on the wild side.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.574
l know whereof l speak.

24:02.752 --> 24:07.960
Believe it or not, there are times l'm
irresistibly drawn to that damn Sam...

24:09.051 --> 24:13.095
...urai...Samurai Frasier Crane.

24:15.683 --> 24:18.304
Warrior of Love.

24:18.477 --> 24:20.600
That's what l call him.

24:20.771 --> 24:24.556
Samurai Frasier Crane.
