WEBVTT

00:04.178 --> 00:05.831
WOMAN: OK, LET ME SEE.

00:05.962 --> 00:08.399
NO. NO.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.315
NO. NO. UH-UH.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.143
NO. NO.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.189
STOP PLAYING AROUND.
TAKE ANOTHER ONE,

00:15.319 --> 00:16.886
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MAKE IT GOOD THIS TIME.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.280
I NEED SOME BEAUTIFUL
VACAY SHOTS FOR
MY INSTAGRAM.

00:19.410 --> 00:20.716
DID YOU JUST SAY "VACAY"?

00:20.846 --> 00:22.370
THIS IS HOW I GET
TO WORK EVERY DAY.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.849
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.982
OK. HOW ABOUT THIS?

00:30.726 --> 00:33.076
OK, OK. STEP A LITTLE
TO YOUR RIGHT.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.471
WHOOPS. I'M RECORDING.

00:36.601 --> 00:37.646
YOUR PHONE IS
SUPER DUMB.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.395
AAH!

00:47.525 --> 00:49.701
MAN: ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
GET BACK.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.704
GET BACK, GET BACK.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.532
THERE'S A MAN OUT HERE
STABBING PEOPLE.

00:54.663 --> 00:55.664
SOME GUY'S HURT
REALLY BAD.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.013
MAN: HEY.HE'S BLEEDING!

00:57.144 --> 00:58.667
LEAVE THEM ALONE.

00:58.797 --> 00:59.494
WE NEED AN AMBULANCE.

00:59.624 --> 01:02.105
WHERE? K STREET AND 18th.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.935
MAN: OH, MY GOD.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.632
SECOND MAN:
HE'S COMING THIS WAY.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.201
OH, MAN. OH, MAN.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.724
HANG IN THERE.
HELP IS COMING.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.552
I'M A NURSE.
LET ME THROUGH.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.599
QUICK, YOUR JACKET.

01:17.729 --> 01:18.948
WE GOT TO PUT PRESSURE
ON HIS WOUNDS.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.123
WE'RE NEAR THE METRO STOP.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.691
WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?

01:23.996 --> 01:26.173
IT'S GONNA BE OK.
STAY WITH US. HEY.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.131
HE WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.741
HE WAS WEARING
A GREEN JACKET,

01:29.872 --> 01:31.047
A WHITE BANDANA
ACROSS HIS FACE.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.353
OH, MY GOD,
IS HE DEAD?

01:32.483 --> 01:33.615
NO. NO, HE JUST PASSED OUT.

01:35.704 --> 01:38.533
HERE! OVER HERE!

01:46.193 --> 01:49.370
ALL RIGHT, FBI.
I NEED YOU TO STAY BACK.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.547
HAVE YOUR MEN SECURE
THE SCENE.

01:52.677 --> 01:53.765
HEY, LET'S GO.

01:53.896 --> 01:54.940
CLEAR A PATH FOR
THE EMTs.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.594
MAKE WAY.

01:56.725 --> 02:00.120
ALL RIGHT, ALL THESE
BUSINESSES ARE GONNA
HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.557
THESE WITNESSES HERE.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.472
ALL RIGHT, I NEED
A HARD TARGET SEARCH

02:04.602 --> 02:06.561
ON EVERY BUILDING,
BUREAU, RESTAURANT,

02:06.691 --> 02:08.606
RESIDENCE,
DEPARTMENT STORE,

02:08.737 --> 02:10.217
CLOTHING STORE,
GROCERY STORY,

02:10.347 --> 02:12.654
AND GAS STATION IN
THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

02:12.784 --> 02:13.568
I WANT OFFICERS--

02:14.743 --> 02:16.788
NOBODY LEAVES
UNTIL I SAY SO.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.750
UNIT CHIEF PRENTISS,
UNIT CHIEF ANDREW MENDOZA,

02:21.880 --> 02:23.012
WASHINGTON FIELD.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.579
SSAs SIMMONS AND JAREAU.

02:24.709 --> 02:25.797
I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
COMING OUT.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.059
WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.757
ALL RIGHT, METRO P.D.
HAS BACK UP ON THE WAY

02:28.887 --> 02:29.932
AND WE'VE SET
A PERIMETER.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.281
WE GOT MULTIPLE
EYEWITNESSES.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.935
IS HE GONNA MAKE IT?MAN: NOT SURE, SIR.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.110
MENDOZA, THE EYEWITNESSES?

02:34.241 --> 02:35.285
OVER HERE WITH
THE CHIEF.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.199
I'M ON IT.

02:37.418 --> 02:37.853
WHAT ABOUT CCTV FOOTAGE
OR SECURITY CAMERAS?

02:38.984 --> 02:40.160
WELL, THESE 3 ARE
GONNA BE OUR BEST BET.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.378
WE SENT AN OFFICER--

02:41.509 --> 02:43.075
MATT.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.252
DAMMIT.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.210
DARCY, NEWS CREWS.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.472
SIR.

02:48.603 --> 02:49.995
THIS IS THE THIRD
MACHETE ATTACK REPORTED

02:50.126 --> 02:51.475
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.216
YEAH, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
CROWDED CITY CENTERS HERE,

02:53.347 --> 02:54.957
BROAD DAYLIGHT,
MEN AND WOMEN.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.046
FIRST TWO VICTIMS ARE
IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.222
AND RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM,

02:59.353 --> 03:02.443
A DOMESTIC FRINGE GROUP,
OR SOME NUTCASE ON
A KILLING SPREE.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.619
NOW, THE FIRST CALL
CAME IN A FEW MINUTES
AFTER NOON?

03:04.749 --> 03:06.751
YEAH. AND EVERY HALF
HOUR SINCE WE'VE HAD
ANOTHER ATTACK.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.536
CHARLES O'NEILL JUST DIED.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.320
THE FIRST VICTIM.
HE DIED FROM HIS INJURIES.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.452
SON OF A BITCH.

03:12.888 --> 03:13.628
THIS MANHUNT JUST TURNED
INTO A HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.151
YEAH. HOW DO YOU WANT
TO HANDLE IT?

03:15.282 --> 03:16.848
FIRST THINGS FIRST,
WE NEED DETAILED STATEMENTS

03:16.979 --> 03:18.067
FROM ANY AND ALL WITNESSES.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.416
AND I WANT THEM VETTED.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.462
ANY AND ALL PERSONNEL
GOING IN OR OUT OF THE SCENE

03:21.592 --> 03:22.593
WE NEED VETTED.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.160
THIS GUY STICKS TO PATTERN.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.988
WE GOT LESS THAN
30 MINUTES BEFORE
HE STRIKES AGAIN.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.119
LET'S MAKE IT COUNT.GOT IT.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.302
FBI WILL RUN POINT.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.652
AND YOU PUT DISTRICT
ON CITYWIDE TACTICAL ALERT?

04:21.783 --> 04:23.698
YES, I'VE GOT OFFICERS
STANDING BY.

04:23.828 --> 04:24.960
WHAT SHOULD I SAY
TO THE MEDIA?

04:25.090 --> 04:27.005
OUR FOCUS IS ON
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.877
RELEASE A DESCRIPTION
OF THE ATTACKER,

04:29.007 --> 04:30.748
BUT DON'T SPECULATE
AS TO MOTIVE OR INTENT.

04:30.879 --> 04:31.793
YES, I'M HERE.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.316
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.492
GARCIA: AS YOU ALL KNOW,
THIS IS THE THIRD MACHETE ATTACK

04:35.623 --> 04:37.320
IN THE STREETS OF
WASHINGTON D.C.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.930
IN THE LAST HOUR.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.584
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO FORM
A JOINT TASKFORCE

04:40.715 --> 04:42.107
WITH THE WASHINGTON
FIELD OFFICE.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.848
THEY NEED A PROFILE.
IT'S OUR JOB TO GET
IT TO THEM.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.067
WHAT DO WE KNOW
SO FAR?

04:45.197 --> 04:46.155
THERE ARE 3 VICTIMS--

04:46.286 --> 04:48.026
CHARLES O'NEILL,
KARY KARLSSON,

04:48.157 --> 04:49.767
AND PARK JI SUNG.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.073
FIRST VICTIM,
CHARLES O'NEILL,

04:51.203 --> 04:52.814
HAS ALREADY DIED
FROM HIS INJURIES.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.991
THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS
ARE AT THE HOSPITAL
IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.688
PRENTISS: WITNESSES
DESCRIBED OUR ATTACKER

04:57.819 --> 05:00.300
AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
MALE IN HIS LATE TWENTIES
TO EARLY THIRTIES.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.345
IT SAYS HERE HE
WAS WEARING
A WHITE BANDANA

05:02.476 --> 05:04.042
OVER THE LOWER
HALF OF HIS FACE.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.305
THAT'S CURIOUS
CONSIDERING

05:05.435 --> 05:06.915
HE'S TAKING NO
OTHER PRECAUTIONS.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.612
YEAH, HE'S PICKED
CROWDED CITY STREETS

05:08.743 --> 05:10.266
AND HEAVILY-TRAFFICKED
THOROUGHFARES.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.920
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
SOMEONE WHO'S AFRAID
OF BEING SEEN.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.356
MAYBE IT FUNCTIONS
AS A MASK,

05:13.487 --> 05:15.010
A COSTUME, A WAY
FOR OUR UNSUB

05:15.140 --> 05:16.620
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF
FROM HIS ACTIONS.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.361
ALVEZ: WHATEVER THE REASON,
I MEAN, IT'S ALL BY DESIGN.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.537
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WANTS
TO CREATE A SPECTACLE,

05:20.668 --> 05:22.017
MAYBE EVEN SEND A MESSAGE.

05:22.147 --> 05:22.713
WHAT, YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA REACH OUT

05:23.714 --> 05:24.541
TO THE MEDIA
LIKE THE D.C. SNIPERS?

05:24.672 --> 05:25.934
RIGHT NOW HE'S LETTING
HIS ACTIONS DO THE TALKING.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.370
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE MACHETE.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.719
I MEAN, THAT'S
A BRUTAL WEAPON.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.417
YOU GOT TO GET
UP CLOSE.
IT'S MESSY.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.853
REID: WELL, FROM
POLITICAL UPRISINGS

05:31.983 --> 05:33.942
TO JASON VOORHEES,
THE ICONOGRAPHY IS
CERTAINLY VIVID.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.378
MAYBE THAT'S
HIS POINT?

05:35.509 --> 05:37.598
BUT THE ANGER INVOLVED
IN HACKING A VICTIM TO DEATH,

05:37.728 --> 05:39.251
IT FEELS MORE PERSONAL
THAN IDEOLOGICAL.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.818
LIKE THIS IS SOME
KIND OF VENDETTA.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.907
WE HAVE A TICKING CLOCK,

05:43.038 --> 05:44.387
AND 3 PRIMARY QUESTIONS--

05:44.518 --> 05:46.041
WHAT DOES OUR UNSUB WANT,

05:46.171 --> 05:47.085
WHERE IS HE HEADED NEXT,

05:47.216 --> 05:48.783
AND HOW IS HE
SELECTING HIS VICTIMS?

05:48.913 --> 05:51.699
TO THAT END, REID,
I NEED YOU TO WORK UP
A GEO-PROFILE.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.962
LUKE, TARA, PENELOPE,
YOU'RE ON VICTIMOLOGY.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.791
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
IF THESE ARE VICTIMS
OF OPPORTUNITY

05:56.921 --> 05:57.966
OR IF HE'S TARGETING THEM--

05:58.096 --> 05:59.446
SORRY, I NEED YOU.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.925
OR IF HE'S TARGETING
THEM SPECIFICALLY.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.492
I GOTTA GO.FOUND SOMETHING.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.016
I WAS GOING OVER
THE 9-1-1 CALLS
LIKE YOU SUGGESTED.

06:05.147 --> 06:08.106
FOR THIS MOST RECENT
ATTACK, THE FIRST CALL
WAS AN ANONYMOUS MALE.

06:08.237 --> 06:09.891
HE GAVE AN ADDRESS
AND A BASIC DESCRIPTION

06:10.021 --> 06:11.632
OF THE ATTACK,
AND THEN HE HUNG UP.

06:11.762 --> 06:12.937
DID THEY TRACE THE CALL?

06:13.068 --> 06:13.982
NO, IT WAS A BURNER PHONE,
BUT THAT'S NOT

06:14.112 --> 06:15.462
WHAT GOT MY ATTENTION.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.598
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

06:21.729 --> 06:23.731
EMS CALL LOGS
FROM THIS MORNING.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.908
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS PUT
THE TIME OF THE THIRD
ATTACK AT 12:58,

06:27.038 --> 06:30.433
BUT THE ANONYMOUS CALL
CAME IN AT 12:57
ON THE DOT.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.521
A FULL MINUTE
BEFORE ANY OTHER?

06:31.652 --> 06:33.044
THAT GOT ME THINKING.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.872
SO I LOOKED INTO
PREVIOUS INCIDENTS.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.831
THE SECOND ATTACK,
AN ANONYMOUS CALL

06:36.961 --> 06:38.136
CAME IN AT 12:30.

06:38.267 --> 06:41.662
CCTV FOOTAGE PUT
THE INCIDENT AT 12:31.

06:41.792 --> 06:42.924
THE FIRST ONE--

06:43.054 --> 06:46.536
WAS AT 12:05 ACCORDING
TO WITNESSES,

06:46.667 --> 06:50.671
BUT THE FIRST EMS CALL
CAME IN AT 12:03.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.281
HE'S CALLING 9-1-1 HIMSELF.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.935
HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPLAIN
SOMEBODY REPORTING

06:54.065 --> 06:55.980
THE ATTACKS BEFORE
THEY HAPPEN?

06:56.111 --> 06:58.156
27 MINUTES.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.158
THAT'S THE TIME
BETWEEN CALLS.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.899
IT'S NOT ROUGHLY
EVERY 30 MINUTES.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.640
IT'S 27 MINUTES
ON THE DOT.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.337
AND HE HASN'T DEVIATED YET.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.513
IT'S A SIGNATURE.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.471
27 MINUTES MEANS
SOMETHING TO HIM.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.560
AND TO STICK TO THAT
SCHEDULE SO CAREFULLY

07:10.691 --> 07:12.388
MEANS THAT THE TIMING
OF THE ATTACKS

07:12.519 --> 07:14.869
IS AS IMPORTANT TO HIM
AS THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES.

07:14.999 --> 07:18.133
ALSO MEANS THAT WE ONLY
HAVE 14 MINUTES LEFT

07:18.263 --> 07:20.570
UNTIL THE NEXT ATTACK,
NOT 17.

07:24.008 --> 07:26.054
JJ: ANYTHING ELSE?

07:26.184 --> 07:28.012
HE HAD ON
A GREEN JACKET.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.145
OK. UH, HEY, MATT.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.799
CAN I BORROW THAT?

07:31.929 --> 07:32.713
WOMAN: YEAH, OF COURSE.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.976
THANKS.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.153
APPARENTLY THE BUILDING'S
CAMERA SYSTEMS ARE DOWN
FOR TESTING.

07:38.283 --> 07:38.936
UH, I GOT YOU COVERED.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.157
THESE TWO FILMED
THE ENTIRE ENCOUNTER.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.463
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.203
OK, THERE.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.641
PARK JI SUNG
ENTERS THE FRAME,

07:47.771 --> 07:49.947
AND THEN THE UNSUB.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.993
WAIT, HE LOOKS WOUNDED

07:52.123 --> 07:53.734
BEFORE ANY OF THIS
EVEN STARTED.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.478
SIMMONS: THE UNSUB
IS IN COMPLETE CONTROL.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.044
JI SUNG'S DEFINITELY
NOT GETTING AWAY.

08:00.175 --> 08:03.178
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
THE UNSUB WAS STALKING
OR HUNTING HIM.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.397
QUESTION IS, DID HE
FOLLOW HIM HERE

08:05.528 --> 08:07.051
OR DID HE JUST PICK
HIM OUT OF THE CROWD?

08:07.182 --> 08:10.968
YEAH. NOT TO MENTION
THERE WERE DOZENS
OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET.

08:11.099 --> 08:12.883
I MEAN, HE COULD HAVE
CHOSEN ANYONE.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.885
HE COULD HAVE ATTACKED
MORE THAN ONE.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.975
YEAH, BUT HE DOESN'T.
HE STICKS WITH HIS MAN,
HIS MISSION.

08:18.106 --> 08:22.197
OK, SO WHAT WAS IT
ABOUT PARK JI SUNG
THAT STOOD OUT?

08:22.327 --> 08:24.808
WHY HIM?

08:30.292 --> 08:31.902
ALVEZ: HEY, DAVE.HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

08:32.033 --> 08:34.905
OK. PRENTISS GAVE ME
A DIRECT ORDER

08:35.036 --> 08:36.603
AND I DISOBEYED IT.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.082
IT SUCKS TO BE BENCHED,

08:38.213 --> 08:39.736
BUT I JUST WANT TO HELP
IN ANY WAY I CAN.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.130
GOOD. I'M WITH
THE SECOND VICTIM,
KARY KARLSSON,

08:42.260 --> 08:44.219
AND I JUST SPOKE
WITH HER PARENTS.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.221
NOW, WHEN I WALKED THEM
THROUGH THE ATTACK,

08:46.351 --> 08:47.962
THEY WERE SURPRISED
TO HEAR THAT KARY

08:48.092 --> 08:50.747
WAS FOUND IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF TRINIDAD.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.749
WELL, THAT'S A ROUGH
PART OF TOWN.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.273
AND THEY HAD NO IDEA
WHY SHE WOULD EVEN
BE THERE.

08:55.404 --> 08:58.146
NOW, KARY'S REASONS
MAY HAVE BEEN
INNOCENT ENOUGH,

08:58.276 --> 09:00.670
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE
DOESN'T HAVE A SECRET.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.106
WHAT, SOME KIND OF
SECRET LIFE?

09:02.237 --> 09:04.456
EXACTLY. I'LL TALK
TO KARY'S FRIENDS.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.284
THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING THERE.

09:06.415 --> 09:07.721
WE'LL RUN IT DOWN
ON THIS END,

09:07.851 --> 09:09.070
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
THANKS, DAVID.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.470
SO SOMETHING INTERESTING
CAME UP IN ROSSI'S INTERVIEW

09:18.601 --> 09:19.907
OF KARY KARLSSON'S FAMILY.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.039
NOW, KARY LIVED
AND WORKED IN NOMA,

09:22.170 --> 09:23.867
AND SHE WAS ATTACKED
IN TRINIDAD.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.782
THIS STRUCK
HER FAMILY AS ODD,

09:25.913 --> 09:27.175
LIKE KARY WAS SOMEWHERE
SHE DIDN'T BELONG.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.873
WELL, LOOK, KARY WAS
A SINGLE, SUCCESSFUL,

09:30.004 --> 09:31.309
CAREER-ORIENTED
GRAPHIC DESIGNER.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.615
I MEAN, SHE COULD HAVE
BEEN IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD

09:32.746 --> 09:34.182
TO MEET A CLIENT
OR A FRIEND.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.487
WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER TWO?

09:35.618 --> 09:37.881
UH, FIRST VICTIM,
CHARLES O'NEILL,

09:38.012 --> 09:41.319
40-YEAR-OLD SECURITY
GUARD, MARRIED, TWO KIDS.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.278
EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT HIM, SUPER GREAT GUY.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.672
YEAH, THIRD VICTIM,
PARK JI SUNG, MARRIED, 55.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.412
HE WAS A LINE COOK
IN CHINATOWN.

09:47.543 --> 09:50.111
ACCORDING TO HIS WIFE,
HE WAS SAVING UP TO OPEN
HIS OWN RESTAURANT.

09:50.241 --> 09:53.157
WE'VE GOT DIVERSITY
IN AGE, RACE,
AND BACKGROUND.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.204
I MEAN, IF THEY'RE
SURROGATES, FOR WHAT?

09:56.334 --> 09:58.902
WELL, YOU SAID THAT
KARY KARLSSON WAS
FOUND IN TRINIDAD,

09:59.033 --> 10:00.164
A NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE SHE DIDN'T BELONG.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.993
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF TRUE FOR ALL
3 OF OUR VICTIMS.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.256
ALL OF THEM WERE FOUND
SOMEWHERE THEY WOULDN'T
CUSTOMARILY BE.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.997
OUTSIDE OF THEIR
REGULAR ROUTINE.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.738
RIGHT, RIGHT.
I MEAN, CHARLES O'NEILL

10:08.869 --> 10:10.131
LIVED AND WORKED
IN ANACOSTIA,

10:10.261 --> 10:12.394
SO WHAT WAS HE DOING
IN NOMA ON A TUESDAY?

10:12.524 --> 10:14.614
YEAH. AND PARK JI SUNG
SHOULD HAVE BEEN

10:14.744 --> 10:16.180
AT HIS RESTAURANT
HE WORKED AT THEN.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.355
SO WHY WAS HE
ON K STREET?

10:17.486 --> 10:19.314
WELL, THEY WERE IN
THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD

10:19.444 --> 10:21.142
AND DID THE UNSUB PICK THEM
BECAUSE THEY STOOD OUT?

10:21.272 --> 10:23.144
AND IF SO, WHAT IS
THE UNSUB'S CONNECTION

10:23.274 --> 10:26.103
TO ALL 3 OF
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS?

10:37.114 --> 10:38.159
PRENTISS: RIGHT NOW
THE UNSUB'S BANKING

10:38.289 --> 10:40.814
ON THE MEDIA TO
AMPLIFY HIS VIOLENCE,
HIS MESSAGE.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.686
WE NEED TO MINIMIZE
THE COVERAGE WITHOUT
DOWNPLAYING THE DANGER.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.209
I'LL GET MY GUYS ON IT.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.214
FROM NOMA TO TRINIDAD
TO K STREET.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.563
IN THE BROADEST OF
TERMS, OUR UNSUB

10:51.694 --> 10:52.782
IS JUMPING FROM
WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS

10:52.913 --> 10:54.392
TO POOR NEIGHBORHOODS,
THEN BACK AGAIN.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.220
SO HE'D NEED
TRANSPORTATION,

10:56.351 --> 10:58.048
SOMETHING THAT WOULD
BLEND IN REGARDLESS
OF THE AREA,

10:58.179 --> 10:59.223
LIKE A SERVICE VAN.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.485
AND GIVEN THE TIME
IT WOULD TAKE TO GET

11:00.616 --> 11:01.748
FROM ONE NEIGHBORHOOD
TO THE NEXT,

11:01.878 --> 11:03.488
FIND HIS VICTIMS,
PLAN HIS ESCAPE, ET CETERA,

11:03.619 --> 11:05.273
IT'S CLEAR THAT HE KNOWS
THE CITY AS ONLY A LOCAL WOULD.

11:05.403 --> 11:09.886
SO HE ATTACKS, ABDUCTS,
ATTACKS, ABDUCTS, AND SO ON.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.106
RIGHT NOW OUR BEST OPTION
IS TO SET UP A SERIES
OF ROADBLOCKS.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.847
AT THE VERY LEAST,
WE CAN DISRUPT HIS MOVEMENTS

11:13.977 --> 11:15.544
AND MAYBE SLOW HIM DOWN.WHERE ARE WE ON TIME?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.980
8 MINUTES, 53 SECONDS.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.242
COORDINATE
WITH METRO P.D.

11:18.373 --> 11:19.417
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
BUY OURSELVES SOME TIME

11:19.548 --> 11:21.071
AND GET OUT
IN FRONT OF HIM.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.725
MENDOZA: PRENTISS, WE
NEED TO START TALKING

11:22.856 --> 11:24.248
ABOUT POSSIBLE MOTIVES.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.293
I'VE GOT OFFICIALS
IN MY EAR WORRIED

11:26.642 --> 11:27.469
THAT THIS COULD BE SOME
SORT OF ACT OF TERRORISM.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.906
I NEED TO KNOW
IF I SHOULD BE
SETTING OFF ALARMS.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.299
OUR UNSUB IS ON A SPREE.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.605
HE'S ONLY KILLED
ONE VICTIM SO FAR,

11:33.736 --> 11:35.782
BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH
HE DID IT WAS SELECTIVE,
PERSONAL.

11:35.912 --> 11:39.220
YOU SAID THAT THE
VIOLENCE HERE HAS BEEN
DELIBERATELY SENSATIONAL,

11:39.350 --> 11:42.049
THE DESIRE FOR THIS
UNSUB TO BE SEEN

11:42.179 --> 11:43.441
SPEAKS TO SOMEONE
ON A MISSION.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.748
YES, BUT THERE'S BEEN
NO MASS CASUALTY EVENT,

11:45.879 --> 11:48.229
AND THE TARGETED
SELECTION OF HIS VICTIMS

11:48.359 --> 11:50.361
FIGHTS AGAINST THE BROADER
IDEA OF TERRORISM.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.841
THEY'RE NOT
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

11:51.972 --> 11:55.453
NO. BUT LOOK, HE COULD
BE CUTTING HIS VICTIMS'
HEADS OFF,

11:55.584 --> 11:57.629
KILLING THEM INSTANTANEOUSLY,
BUT HE'S NOT.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.937
HE'S LEAVING THEM
SUFFERING AND BLEEDING
ON THE GROUND.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.939
YES, HE'S ANGRY
AND HE'S MOTIVATED,

12:03.070 --> 12:05.246
BUT IF THIS WAS POLITICAL,
WHY CALL 9

12:05.376 --> 12:08.771
HE'S GIVING THEM
A CHANCE TO SURVIVE.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.165
AGENTS, MY MEN
HAVE FOUND SOMETHING.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.428
THIS MATCHES
THE SUSPECT'S BANDANA.

12:13.558 --> 12:14.995
MENDOZA: WE SHOULD
CLEAR THIS GARAGE.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.779
HE MAY HAVE A VEHICLE
OR BE LOOKING
TO BOOST ONE.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.955
YOU TWO TAKE
THE SOUTH ENTRANCE.
CHIEF WAGNER.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.087
WAGNER: WE'LL TAKE
THE NORTH.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.436
YES, MA'AM.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.177
MAN: ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GET EYES ON ALL DOORS.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.322
MENDOZA: HANDS UP!

12:38.453 --> 12:39.628
PUT YOUR HANDS UP NOW!

12:39.759 --> 12:41.891
I GOT HIM. I SHOT HIM,
THE MACHETE KILLER.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.066
PRENTISS:
DROP YOUR WEAPON.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.807
DO IT NOW.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.854
WAGNER: I NEED AN AMBULANCE.
I HAVE A SUSPECT DOWN.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.333
I SAW HIM TRYING TO
BREAK INTO THAT CAR.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.422
HE HAD ON--HE HAS ON
THE GREEN JACKET.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.468
THEY SAID ON THE NEWS.
AND THE MACHETE.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.730
HE HAS THE MACHETE.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.347
IT'S NOT HIM.

13:03.478 --> 13:04.958
WAIT, IT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?

13:05.088 --> 13:06.611
DAMMIT!

13:06.742 --> 13:07.830
MAN: IT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?

13:07.961 --> 13:08.700
HE'S THE MACHETE
KILLER, RIGHT?

13:08.831 --> 13:09.832
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

13:09.963 --> 13:11.399
NO, I THOUGHT--
HE LOOKED--

13:11.529 --> 13:12.922
HE LOOKS LIKE THE GUY.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.489
HE HAS ON THE
GREEN JACKET.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.970
HE LOOKS LIKE THE GUY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS HIM.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.451
I THOUGHT IT WAS HIM.
HE LOOKED LIKE THE GUY.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.852
AN UNARMED MAN
WAS JUST SHOT.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.593
I'M ASKING, HOW DO YOU
WANT ME TO PROCEED?

13:31.723 --> 13:33.203
BE TRANSPARENT.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.640
EXPLAIN THAT
THE SHOOTER IS
IN POLICE CUSTODY

13:35.771 --> 13:37.686
AND THAT'S IT'S
AN EVOLVING SITUATION.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.035
THE WHOLE CITY IS WATCHING.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.951
WE GET THIS WRONG,
THERE COULD BE A RIOT.
PEOPLE IN THE STREET.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.213
THEN DON'T GET IT WRONG.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.782
UNTIL THIS IS OVER,
WE NEED D.C. RESIDENTS
TO STAY INSIDE,

13:46.913 --> 13:49.480
SHARE ANY AND ALL INFORMATION
THEY HAVE WITH THE AUTHORITIES

13:49.611 --> 13:51.569
AND ONLY THE AUTHORITIES.
THAT'S IT.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.358
PRENTISS, YOU GOOD?

13:59.012 --> 14:00.709
IT'S MY FAULT.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.364
I TOLD THE POLICE
TO RELEASE A DESCRIPTION
OF THE SUSPECT.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.931
I SHOULD HAVE WAITED
UNTIL WE KNEW MORE.

14:05.061 --> 14:08.108
NOW AN INNOCENT MAN
MAY LOSE HIS LIFE
BECAUSE OF IT.

14:08.238 --> 14:11.241
NO, WE HAD A DUTY
TO INFORM THE PUBLIC,

14:11.372 --> 14:12.721
ABOVE ALL ELSE.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.679
YOU ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.681
THERE'S NO WAY
TO PREDICT A KID
WITH A GUN

14:16.812 --> 14:19.641
IS GONNA TRY TO
PLAY HERO.

14:19.771 --> 14:20.860
VICTIM'S NAME IS
PETER SALAH.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.296
HE'S HEADING INTO
SURGERY RIGHT NOW.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.427
HE'S IN CRITICAL
CONDITION.

14:23.558 --> 14:24.559
PETER'S 24, SINGLE,

14:24.689 --> 14:25.908
WORKS DOWN THE STREET
AS A HANDYMAN.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.475
HE WAS ON A JOB
ALL MORNING, HEADED OUT

14:27.605 --> 14:28.824
TO GET SOME PIPING
TO FINISH A WORK ODER.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.521
THE KEYS TO HIS CAR
WERE IN HIS POCKET.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.306
OK. I WANT A FULL SEARCH OF
ALL THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.090
OUR UNSUB WAS HERE.

14:34.221 --> 14:37.050
AND WE HAVE LESS
THAN 5 MINUTES.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.835
ALL RIGHT,
I JUST SPOKE TO A NEIGHBOR

14:39.966 --> 14:41.532
WHO SAYS THAT HE SAW
KARY KARLSSON BEING FORCED

14:41.663 --> 14:43.447
INTO A VEHICLE OUTSIDE
HER APARTMENT BUILDING.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.406
SHE WAS ABDUCTED?ACCORDING THE NEIGHBOR,

14:45.536 --> 14:46.886
A MAN FITTING
THE DESCRIPTION
OF OUR UNSUB

14:47.016 --> 14:49.671
APPROACHED KARY
BRANDISHING A WEAPON
OF SOME KIND.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.064
PROBABLY THE MACHETE.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.936
HE FORCED HER INTO
A WHITE SEDAN AND DROVE OFF.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.808
THE NEIGHBOR DIDN'T
REPORT THE INCIDENT
UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT WORK

14:56.939 --> 14:58.158
SOME 40 MINUTES LATER.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.463
SOME NEIGHBOR.

14:59.594 --> 15:02.640
SO OUR UNSUB GRABBED KARY
OUTSIDE OF HER LOFT,

15:02.771 --> 15:04.816
DROVE HER TO
A SECONDARY LOCATION,

15:04.947 --> 15:06.949
VICIOUSLY ATTACKED HER,
AND THEN LET HER GO.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.996
WHY? WHY RISK
MOVING HER AT ALL?

15:10.126 --> 15:11.954
DO YOU THINK THEY
WERE ALL ABDUCTED?

15:12.085 --> 15:12.912
THAT'S A GOOD BET.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.348
LEWIS:
IT'S LIKE REID SAID.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.090
THE MOVEMENTS OF THIS UNSUB,
THEY'RE CALCULATED.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.353
HE TAKES A
WORKING-CLASS FAMILY MAN

15:19.483 --> 15:21.703
AND KILLS HIM IN
AN UPSCALE COMMUNITY,

15:21.833 --> 15:24.097
AND THEN HE TAKES
A WELL-TO-DO GRAPHIC DESIGNER

15:24.227 --> 15:25.968
AND DROPS HER OFF
IN A SEEDY NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.491
AND FINALLY, HE TAKES A COOK

15:27.622 --> 15:31.060
AND LAYS HIM AT THE FEET
OF RICH LOBBYISTS ON K STREET.

15:31.191 --> 15:34.629
THIS ENTIRE THING,
THIS IS ABOUT INEQUALITY.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.154
RIGHT. OK.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.764
I'M ON IT.

15:39.895 --> 15:43.333
HEY, HANG ON. HANG ON.

15:43.464 --> 15:48.164
SO OUR UNSUB GRABS KARY,

15:48.295 --> 15:50.862
PUTS HER IN THE CAR,

15:50.993 --> 15:52.777
CLOSES THE DOOR,
LOCKS IT,

15:52.908 --> 15:55.432
RUNS AROUND TO THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE CAR,

15:55.563 --> 15:58.174
GETS IN, CLOSES
THE DOOR, LOCKS IT,

15:58.305 --> 16:00.263
STARTS THE CAR,
AND DRIVES.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.963
AND ALL THE WHILE
HOLDING A MACHETE
ON KARY?

16:04.093 --> 16:07.009
AND SHE DOESN'T FIGHT
BACK OR MAKE A RUN FOR IT?

16:07.140 --> 16:08.750
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.796
UNLESS...

16:19.717 --> 16:21.067
HE HAS A PARTNER.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.939
SOMEONE IN THE BACKSEAT
WITH A KNIFE OR A GUN

16:24.070 --> 16:26.507
TO CONTROL THE VICTIM.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.075
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A TEAM.

16:30.728 --> 16:33.079
USUALLY IT'S JUST
ME AND MY GUYS
TALKING IT OVER.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.255
WE DON'T NORMALLY
DO PROFILES.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.039
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.608
WAGNER:
EVERYBODY SETTLED?

16:40.738 --> 16:41.870
OK, LET'S GO.

16:43.437 --> 16:46.570
AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE
NOW TWO HOURS INTO
A CITYWIDE MANHUNT.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.051
WE CAN NOW SAY WITH
CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR A PAIR

16:49.182 --> 16:51.271
OF STATEMENT-ORIENTED
SPREE KILLERS.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.447
THESE PARTNERS ARE BELIEVED
TO BE IN THEIR LATE TWENTIES

16:53.577 --> 16:56.058
TO EARLY THIRTIES,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES.

16:56.189 --> 17:00.584
OUR UNSUBS ARE
PROBABLY BONDED BY
A SHARED GRIEVANCE--

17:00.715 --> 17:02.543
A LOSS OR A PAST TRAUMA.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.720
AS WITH ANY PARTNERSHIP,
LIKE THE D.C. SNIPERS,

17:05.850 --> 17:07.417
THERE IS MOST LIKELY
A DOMINANT AND A SUBMISSIVE.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.115
EXAMINATION OF
THE WOUND PATTERNS

17:09.245 --> 17:12.901
DICTATES THAT BOTH
OF THESE MEN HAVE HAD
HANDS IN THESE ATTACKS.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.642
THEY'RE TAKING TURNS.

17:14.772 --> 17:17.340
SO WHILE ONE MAY BE
DOMINANT OVER THE OTHER,

17:17.471 --> 17:19.473
THEY ARE EQUAL
PARTICIPANTS,

17:19.603 --> 17:21.040
EQUALLY DANGEROUS.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.042
OUR SUSPECTS ARE
ABDUCTING THEIR VICTIMS.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.261
THEY'RE TAKING THEM
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS
WHERE THEY LIVE

17:25.392 --> 17:28.482
INTO NEIGHBORHOODS THEY WOULD
NOT BE LIKELY TO VISIT.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.049
THIS BACK AND FORTH
ACROSS THE CITY

17:30.179 --> 17:31.963
IS A DELIBERATE
PROVOCATION

17:32.094 --> 17:35.663
DESIGNED TO QUESTION
OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT
WHO BELONGS WHERE--

17:35.793 --> 17:38.753
INEQUALITY,
PRIVILEGE, CLASS.

17:38.883 --> 17:43.323
OUR UNSUB'S ANGER IS
FOCUSED ON SOMETHING
ALONG THOSE LINES.

17:43.453 --> 17:46.413
WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE
ON RECENT FLASHPOINTS
IN THE CITY'S HISTORY--

17:46.543 --> 17:48.284
BAD SHOOTING,
SUSPICIOUS DEATH.

17:48.415 --> 17:51.070
ANYTHING THAT WOULD
HAVE CAUSED A BACKLASH
OR CONTROVERSY

17:51.200 --> 17:52.375
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.377
THESE ATTACKS
ARE A STATEMENT.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.075
IT'S THEIR RESPONSE.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.164
AND THEY WON'T STOP
UNTIL THEY FEEL HEARD.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.905
IN ADDITION TO THE MANNED
CHECKPOINTS GOING UP
AROUND THE DISTRICT,

18:01.036 --> 18:05.127
WE NEED TO BE LOOKING
AT ARREST RECORDS,
COMPLAINTS, THREATS.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.781
THESE TWO ARE OUT THERE.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.913
WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR.
LET'S GET TO WORK.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.399
WAGNER: OK, LET'S GO.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.879
ANYTHING?

18:18.009 --> 18:21.796
NO. GARCIA'S MONITORING
EMS CALLS, BUT THEY'RE LATE.

18:21.926 --> 18:22.884
MAYBE OUR ROADBLOCKS
ARE WORKING.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.668
IF OUR UNSUBS
STICK TO PATTERN,

18:24.799 --> 18:26.148
THEY'VE LIKELY ALREADY
ABDUCTED THEIR NEXT VICTIM.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.584
THE QUESTION IS WHERE
WOULD THEY TAKE THEM?

18:27.715 --> 18:29.369
WELL, WHAT WOULD MAKE
THE BIGGEST SPLASH?

18:29.499 --> 18:30.892
WELL, IF THEY CONTINUED
HEADING NORTH CYCLING
BETWEEN RICH

18:31.022 --> 18:32.894
AND POOR NEIGHBORHOODS, THEY
HAVE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS,

18:33.024 --> 18:34.200
BUT COLUMBIA HEIGHTS
HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS LATELY.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.505
JJ: YEAH,
I READ ABOUT THAT.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.072
RESIDENTS ARE UPSET
ABOUT SOME OF THE EFFORTS

18:37.203 --> 18:38.856
TO GENTRIFY
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:38.987 --> 18:39.988
YEAH. THEY'RE TRYING
TO TURN THE AREA

18:40.119 --> 18:41.250
AROUND HEIGHT'S PARK
INTO LUXURY CONDOS.

18:42.817 --> 18:42.904
WELL, THAT WOULD
CERTAINLY FIT WITH
THEIR MISSION STATEMENT.

18:44.253 --> 18:44.819
REID: WE'VE GOT UNITS
CANVASSING THESE TWO BLOCKS,

18:44.949 --> 18:46.429
BUT NOTHING HERE
NEAR THE PARK.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.954
CALL LUKE.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.173
HAVE HIM MEET YOU THERE

18:51.304 --> 18:52.261
WITH A COUPLE OF
PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.045
TAKE A LOOK.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.657
THEY'RE LATE,
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP,

18:56.787 --> 18:58.572
NOT ONCE THEY'VE FINALLY
GOT EVERYONE'S ATTENTION.

18:58.702 --> 18:59.921
STILL, WHAT'S THEIR ENDGAME?

19:00.051 --> 19:02.010
I MEAN, THEY AREN'T TRYING
TO GET AWAY WITH THIS,

19:02.141 --> 19:03.794
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE
TAKEN MORE PRECAUTIONS.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.187
IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE
PREPARED TO DIE,

19:05.318 --> 19:07.102
LIKE THE VEGAS OR
THE ORLANDO SHOOTERS,

19:07.233 --> 19:10.323
EITHER IN A HAIL
OF BULLETS OR
SUICIDE BY COP.

19:10.453 --> 19:11.802
WELL, THAT'S LIKELY
TRUE FOR THE DOMINANT,

19:11.933 --> 19:13.152
WHOSE SENSE OF AGREE

19:13.282 --> 19:14.414
HEY, GARCIA.

19:14.544 --> 19:15.719
I JUST INTERCEPTED
A 9-1-1 CALL.

19:15.850 --> 19:16.590
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER ATTACK.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.069
WHERE?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.506
RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

19:20.637 --> 19:23.074
HELP! I NEED HELP!
SOMEBODY!

19:24.380 --> 19:26.600
DRIVER: HEY, WATCH IT!

19:26.730 --> 19:28.079
JJ: ARE YOU HURT?

19:28.210 --> 19:28.993
NO, THE PARKING LOT. A MAN.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.212
HURRY!

19:30.343 --> 19:32.083
THIS IS SSA
LUKE ALVEZ.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.955
I NEED AN AMBULANCE
IMMEDIATELY.

19:35.391 --> 19:38.394
WE'RE IN A RESIDENTIAL
PARKING LOT ON 16th,

19:38.525 --> 19:39.787
700 BLOCK.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.005
NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T MOVE.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.529
DON'T MOVE, OK?

19:42.659 --> 19:43.791
HEY, DID YOU SEE
WHO ATTACKED HIM?

19:43.921 --> 19:46.097
IT WAS A MAN,
AFRICAN AMERICAN.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.229
WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

19:47.360 --> 19:48.578
THAT WAY.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.145
JJ: GO. GO, LUKE.
WE'RE FINE.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.799
OFFICERS, COME WITH ME.
LET'S GO.

19:58.501 --> 20:01.025
1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4

20:01.156 --> 20:03.114
AND 1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.812
AND 1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4.

20:04.942 --> 20:06.074
HEY, STAY BACK.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.425
MAN: HANG ON.

20:09.556 --> 20:12.776
HEY, COME ON, MAN.
TURN THAT OFF.

20:12.907 --> 20:16.084
FBI, TURN YOUR PHONE OFF.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.130
LET'S GO BACK TO
THE FIRST VICTIM,
CHARLES O'NEILL.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.045
OUR UNSUBS TOOK
A BIG RISK

20:21.176 --> 20:23.134
GOING AFTER A GUY
LIKE THAT FIRST.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.180
JJ: FBI. TURN YOUR PHONE OFF.GUYS, THIS IS LIVE.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.921
THIS IS HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.489
LEWIS: OH, MY GOD.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.493
SON OF A BITCH.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.190
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANY OF THIS ON THE NEWS.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.626
WE NEED TO SHUT THIS
FEED DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.411
AGREED.

20:42.415 --> 20:43.807
ALVEZ: GET THE PLATE!

20:51.162 --> 20:53.600
COME ON. AND 2 AND 3, 4.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.428
SPENCER, COME ON.
LET ME.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.126
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
I CAN DO IT. I CAN DO THIS.

21:10.573 --> 21:13.010
HEY. UH, HE'S BEEN
STABBED MULTIPLE TIMES.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.143
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.537
WE GOT IT FROM HERE.
WE GOT IT.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.103
OK.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.802
MAN: WE'RE GETTING
HIM SOME HELP, GUYS.
BACK IT UP.

21:21.932 --> 21:23.543
COME ON, GET BACK.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.244
CLEAR.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.202
COME ON, COME ON.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.516
COME BACK TO US.

21:40.647 --> 21:41.909
HE MUST HAVE HIT
AN ARTERY.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.171
HE'S LOST TOO MUCH BLOOD.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.172
GOING AGAIN.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.175
CLEAR.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.139
HE'S GONE.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.185
SORRY.

22:00.101 --> 22:03.147
HE'S DEAD.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.192
NO, HE'S NOT DEAD.
THERE'S GOT TO BE

22:04.323 --> 22:05.236
SOMETHING ELSE THAT
THEY CAN DO.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.761
GARCIA...

22:07.891 --> 22:09.719
RESTART THE CLOCK.

22:28.129 --> 22:28.825
FBI, DON'T MOVE.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.174
OFFICER: PUT YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.047
DROP THE WEAPON NOW.

22:33.177 --> 22:34.135
TURN AROUND.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.529
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.420
UH, 700.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.291
NICE WORK.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.597
YEAH, THANKS.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.903
WE TRACKED HIM FROM
THE PARKING LOT.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.687
THEY SPLIT UP?YEAH, THIS ONE RAN.

23:04.818 --> 23:05.471
THE OTHER ONE DROVE OFF.

23:06.559 --> 23:06.602
WE'VE GOT UNIFORMS
CANVASSING THE AREA.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.039
UPON CONTACT, THIS
SUSPECT SURRENDERED.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.867
NO FIGHT.

23:10.998 --> 23:13.479
HE'S GOT NO I.D.
HE HASN'T SAID OR
ASKED FOR ANYTHING.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.524
BUT HE GAVE HIMSELF UP.MM-HMM.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.440
WE PROFILED THESE GUYS
AS CONFRONTATIONAL
AND STATEMENT-DRIVEN.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.007
THE FACT THAT HE
SURRENDERED MAKES ME THINK

23:20.137 --> 23:21.791
HE MUST BE THE SUBMISSIVE
IN THE PARTNERSHIP.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.140
HOW DO YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

23:23.271 --> 23:25.142
WE NEED TO GET HIM TALKING,

23:25.273 --> 23:27.449
SEE IF WE CAN GET HIM
TO GIVE UP HIS ACCOMPLICE.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.146
I'LL DO IT ALONE.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.452
I THINK HE'LL RESPOND
TO SOMEONE LESS AUTHORITATIVE

23:30.583 --> 23:32.323
THAN HIS PARTNER.

23:35.501 --> 23:36.545
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.242
YES, MA'AM.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.858
I'M EMILY PRENTISS.
I'M WITH THE FBI.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.729
YOU CAN CALL ME EMILY.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.558
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

23:49.689 --> 23:51.604
YOU HAVE A NAME, RIGHT?

23:56.304 --> 23:58.088
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARTNER?

23:58.219 --> 24:00.134
WHERE'D HE GO?

24:00.264 --> 24:02.832
HE JUST TOOK OFF,

24:02.963 --> 24:04.268
LEFT YOU BEHIND?

24:04.399 --> 24:06.183
LEFT YOU HOLDING
THE MACHETE.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.318
I CAN HELP YOU.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.669
THERE'S STILL TIME
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.193
I KNOW THIS WASN'T
YOUR IDEA.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.806
AND THIS ISN'T WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.678
18:46.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.680
18:45.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.377
18:44.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.641
18:43.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.517
THIS IS NOT A GAME.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.911
NO, IT ISN'T, EMILY.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.391
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

24:40.522 --> 24:44.352
TICK TOCK, EMILY.
TICK TOCK.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.057
ALL RIGHT,
THEY'VE SPLIT UP.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.843
THEY KNOW WE'RE
CLOSING IN.
WHAT'S NEXT?

24:56.973 --> 24:58.366
WELL, WE'VE DISRUPTED
THEIR ABILITY TO ABDUCT

24:58.497 --> 24:59.933
AND TO TRANSPORT
THEIR VICTIMS,

25:00.063 --> 25:02.152
SO NOW THE DOMINANT
NOT ONLY HAS TO PICK
HIS NEXT VICTIM,

25:02.283 --> 25:03.806
BUT HIS NEXT SPOT.

25:03.937 --> 25:07.114
MAYBE A MALL
OR MUSEUM, PARK.

25:07.244 --> 25:08.158
RIGHT. SOMEWHERE WEALTHY,

25:08.289 --> 25:09.899
SOMETHING THAT
REPRESENTS PROGRESS,

25:10.030 --> 25:11.814
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
AT THIS POINT,

25:11.945 --> 25:13.599
IT'S PERSONAL TO THEM.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.339
PRENTISS: HE'S TAUNTING US.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.819
AS LONG AS HIS PARTNER'S
STILL OUT THERE,

25:16.950 --> 25:18.560
THE MISSION CONTINUES,
AND HE KNOWS IT.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.344
YEAH, WE CAN'T JUST
KEEP MAKING RUNS AT HIM.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.302
HE'S GONNA LAWYER UP.

25:21.432 --> 25:22.564
IN 15 MINUTES,
IT WON'T MATTER.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.523
NO ONE ELSE DIES TODAY.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.875
DAVE, TELL ME YOU
FOUND SOMETHING.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.180
WE'VE BEEN SPINNING
OUR WHEELS,

25:30.311 --> 25:31.355
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY THESE TWO WOULD

25:31.486 --> 25:33.532
GO AFTER A GUY LIKE
CHARLES O'NEILL FIRST.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.230
WELL, I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH
O'NEILL'S WIFE.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.406
SHE TOLD ME THAT
OUTSIDE OF HIS DAY JOB,

25:38.537 --> 25:40.495
HE WOULD MOONLIGHT
AS A BOUNCER.

25:40.626 --> 25:44.238
HE WORKED IN ANACOSTIA
AT A CLUB CALLED HARD TIMES.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.196
LAST WEEK THERE
WAS A STABBING.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.198
A YOUNG MAN DIED.
BLED TO DEATH.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.199
SOUND FAMILIAR?

25:49.330 --> 25:50.287
GARCIA: I FOUND IT

25:50.418 --> 25:52.028
BURIED IN THE WEEKLY
BEAT REPORT.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.596
YOUNG MAN'S NAME
WAS TOM WELLS,
18 YEARS OLD,

25:54.727 --> 25:55.902
BORN AND RAISED
IN THE DISTRICT.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.034
HE'S SURVIVED BY HIS
TWO OLDER BROTHERS,

25:58.165 --> 25:59.601
JAMES AND MARCUS WELLS.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.690
JAMES IS THE OLDEST.
HE RAISED BOTH THE OTHER TWO

26:01.821 --> 26:03.910
WHEN THEIR MOM DIED
WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.782
YOU'VE ARRESTED MARCUS.
JAMES IS STILL OUT THERE.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.524
LOOKS LIKE THEIR BROTHER'S
FUNERAL WAS YESTERDAY.

26:09.655 --> 26:12.266
WHAT ABOUT THE INCIDENT ITSELF?
DID THEY ARREST ANYONE?

26:12.396 --> 26:16.009
YEAH. GUY'S NAME
WAS LONNY CARSON.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.750
HE IS IN JAIL.
HE'S AWAITING TRIAL.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.707
I'M SENDING YOU
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT NOW.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.230
PRENTISS: LOOP
MENDOZA'S TEAM IN.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.841
I WANT AGENTS AT
THEIR WORK AND HOME,

26:21.971 --> 26:23.364
GIRLFRIENDS,
BOYFRIENDS, FAMILY.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.323
NO STONE UNTURNED.
THAT'S HOW I ROLL.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.894
WHAT THE HELL AM
I MISSING HERE?

26:32.025 --> 26:34.984
IF THE GUY THAT
STABBED THEIR BROTHER
IS SITTING IN JAIL,

26:35.115 --> 26:37.334
WHY ARE THEY STILL
OUT HERE CARVING UP
INNOCENT PEOPLE?

26:37.465 --> 26:43.123
OK, GO BACK TO THE PROFILE.
INEQUALITY, CLASS, INJUSTICE.

26:43.253 --> 26:46.430
THEY'RE TRYING TO TELL US
THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING DEEPER.

26:46.561 --> 26:48.432
SO THEN WHY TARGET
CHARLES O'NEILL?

26:48.563 --> 26:51.087
ALL THE OTHERS SEEM
TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN
AT RANDOM.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.002
IT'S POSSIBLE THEY FEEL
CHARLES O'NEILL

26:53.133 --> 26:55.352
BEARS SOME BLAME
FOR TOM'S DEATH.

26:55.483 --> 26:58.007
BUT CHARLES IS LIKE THEM.
HE'S FROM A SIMILAR
NEIGHBORHOOD

26:58.138 --> 26:59.922
AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.795
STRIKING HIM FIRST
DRAWS A DIRECT PARALLEL

27:02.925 --> 27:05.885
BETWEEN THEIR BROTHER'S
DEATH AND EVERYONE ELSE'S.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.974
THERE'S NO WAY MARCUS
IS GONNA GIVE UP
HIS BROTHER.

27:08.104 --> 27:10.977
MAYBE NOT. BUT FOR
THE FIRST TIME TODAY,
WE HAVE THE UPPER HAND.

27:21.465 --> 27:26.296
MARCUS WELLS,
1521 HARRIS STREET
IN GARFIELD HEIGHTS.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.821
BROTHER OF TOM
AND JAMES WELLS.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.913
I AM SORRY ABOUT
THE LOSS OF YOUR BROTHER.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.263
HE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD KID.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.569
GRADUATED TOP OF HIS CLASS.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.354
TOM WAS A FRESHMAN
AT HALLRIDGE UNIVERSITY--

27:40.484 --> 27:41.485
DON'T.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.924
DON'T EVEN SAY
HIS NAME.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.535
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY HIS NAME.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.147
WHAT ABOUT JAMES?

27:51.278 --> 27:53.236
I'M GOING TO LEVEL
WITH YOU, MARCUS.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.412
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS
FOR THIS TO END,

27:55.543 --> 27:57.806
AND I DON'T THINK YOU
WANT TO BURY ANOTHER
BROTHER THIS WEEK.

27:57.937 --> 28:01.157
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHERE JAMES IS.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.464
I KNOW THIS WHOLE DAY
WAS HIS IDEA.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.684
HE WAS SENT TO
JUVIE TWICE, JAIL ONCE.

28:05.814 --> 28:06.859
JAMES LIKES TO FIGHT.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.470
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO JAMES IS.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.385
HE RAISED US.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.475
HE WORKED TWO JOBS
JUST TO PUT TOM
THROUGH SCHOOL.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.651
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.914
YOU DON'T KNOW ME,

28:19.045 --> 28:21.047
WHAT WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH.

28:21.177 --> 28:22.875
SO TELL ME.

28:23.005 --> 28:26.008
WHY? YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME OR MY BROTHER.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.489
YOU JUST AS SOON SHOOT
US DEAD IN THE STREET,

28:28.619 --> 28:31.187
LIKE THAT UNARMED MAN
WHO GOT SHOT TODAY.

28:31.318 --> 28:32.406
WHERE WERE YOU THEN?

28:32.536 --> 28:34.800
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO HELP HIM?

28:34.930 --> 28:37.193
THE WAY I SEE IT,
THAT BLOOD IS ON
YOUR HANDS.

28:37.324 --> 28:40.283
SO YOU THINK THIS IS
WHAT TOM WOULD HAVE WANTED,

28:40.414 --> 28:42.633
FOR YOU TO KILL
A BUNCH OF INNOCENT PEOPLE
IN HIS NAME?

28:42.764 --> 28:44.244
SEE, I THINK HE
WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.462
NO, NO, NO.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.379
NO, HE WOULD HAVE
UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE
WERE TRYING TO SAY.

28:49.510 --> 28:53.601
MARCUS, WHATEVER POINT
YOU WERE TRYING TO MAKE
IS IRRELEVANT NOW.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
YOU'VE KILLED TWO PEOPLE.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.910
YOU'VE CRITICALLY
INJURED TWO OTHERS.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.563
THIS IS OVER.

28:59.694 --> 29:02.871
LOOK, YOUR ONLY OPTION
IS TO TALK TO ME,

29:03.002 --> 29:04.438
TO TELL ME WHERE
JAMES IS.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.570
THERE IS STILL TIME.

29:06.701 --> 29:09.008
YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE HERE
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.400
THE RIGHT THING?

29:10.531 --> 29:12.359
MY BROTHER DID
EVERYTHING RIGHT

29:12.489 --> 29:13.664
AND HE NEVER HAD
A CHANCE.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.971
HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

29:16.102 --> 29:18.582
TODAY PROVED THAT.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.629
A CHANCE AT WHAT?

29:23.849 --> 29:25.589
SURVIVING?

29:30.551 --> 29:34.511
WHY 27, MARCUS?
WHY NOT 26 OR 24?

29:36.383 --> 29:39.690
I ASK MYSELF THAT
QUESTION EVERY DAY.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.216
EVERY DAMN DAY.

29:47.481 --> 29:50.136
WHAT DOES 27 MEAN?

29:51.528 --> 29:54.183
EVERYTHING.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.359
IT MEANS EVERYTHING.

29:58.361 --> 30:01.712
I'M DONE TALKING.
I WANT A LAWYER.

30:14.987 --> 30:15.857
ANYTHING?

30:15.988 --> 30:17.424
WE'LL SEE.

30:17.554 --> 30:18.599
GARCIA?

30:18.729 --> 30:19.600
YEAH, I'M HERE.
TALK TO ME.

30:20.906 --> 30:21.776
I NEED YOU TO PULL
EMERGENCY RESPONSE
CALL LOGS

30:21.907 --> 30:23.430
FROM THE NIGHT THAT
TOM WELLS WAS MURDERED.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.953
ON IT.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.608
HOW MUCH TIME
DO WE HAVE?

30:27.738 --> 30:28.522
LESS THAN 10 MINUTES.

30:28.652 --> 30:29.828
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

30:29.958 --> 30:31.742
27 MINUTES HAS BEEN
STARING US IN THE FACE

30:31.873 --> 30:33.266
THIS WHOLE TIME.

30:33.396 --> 30:36.356
MARCUS AND HIS BROTHER
THINK THAT WHERE YOU LIVE

30:36.486 --> 30:38.184
NOT ONLY DETERMINES
YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE,

30:38.314 --> 30:39.620
BUT YOUR QUALITY OF CARE.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.535
YOUR ZIP CODE
DETERMINES YOUR FATE.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.493
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
MOVING THESE PEOPLE
BACK AND FORTH.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.626
THEY'RE TRYING TO
SHOW US THE DISPARITY
IN RESPONSE TIMES.

30:45.756 --> 30:47.019
THAT'S WHY
THEY CALL 9-1-1.

30:47.149 --> 30:48.759
YEAH, RICH NEIGHBORHOODS
GET FASTER CARE

30:48.890 --> 30:50.239
THAN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.154
AND ACTIONS SPEAK
LOUDER THAN WORDS.

30:52.285 --> 30:55.462
THEY THOUGHT THE MOST
EFFECT WAY TO GET
THEIR MESSAGE ACROSS

30:55.592 --> 30:56.942
WOULD BE TO DEMONSTRATE
IT IN REAL TIME.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.639
THE NIGHT TOM DIED,

30:58.769 --> 31:00.380
I BET WE'RE GONNA
FIND OUT IT TOOK
27 MINUTES

31:00.510 --> 31:01.555
FOR HELP TO ARRIVE.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.818
TOM PROBABLY BLED
TO DEATH IN THE STREET

31:03.949 --> 31:05.298
IN HIS BROTHERS' ARMS.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.040
OH, JEEZ, THIS IS AWFUL.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.564
THEY CALLED 9-1-1 9 TIMES.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.696
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,
IT TOOK THE AMBULANCE

31:12.827 --> 31:14.698
27 MINUTES TO GET THERE.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.310
TOM WAS PRONOUNCED
DEAD AT THE SCENE.

31:19.703 --> 31:23.055
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT TOM AND JAMES'
RELATIONSHIP?

31:23.185 --> 31:25.448
JAMES DID EVERYTHING
FOR HIS LITTLE BROTHER.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.102
THE NIGHT THAT THEY
WENT OUT,

31:27.233 --> 31:29.626
IT WAS TO CELEBRATE
TOM'S FIRST SEMESTER
AT HALLRIDGE UNIVERSITY.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.237
HALLRIDGE.
THAT'S IT.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.326
WHEN I MENTIONED
THAT TOM WAS
A FRESHMAN THERE,

31:33.456 --> 31:34.675
MARCUS LOST IT.

31:34.805 --> 31:35.719
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHERE JAMES IS HEADED?

31:37.069 --> 31:38.026
I THINK THEY'RE
GRIEVING FOR WHAT
THEY'VE LOST,

31:38.157 --> 31:40.463
THIS FUTURE THAT
WAS RIPPED AWAY

31:40.594 --> 31:41.595
FROM THEIR BROTHER
AND THEIR FAMILY,

31:41.725 --> 31:42.988
AND HALLRIDGE IS
A PART OF THAT.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.467
AN INNOCENT STUDENT
WOULD IN ESSENCE

31:44.598 --> 31:45.904
BE THE PERFECT STAND IN
FOR THEIR BROTHER.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.122
ROSSI:
THE ULTIMATE SURROGATE.

31:47.253 --> 31:48.776
GARCIA: HALLRIDGE
ISN'T FAR,

31:48.907 --> 31:50.212
JUST A FEW MILES AWAY.

31:50.343 --> 31:51.213
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE THEY'VE BEEN

31:51.344 --> 31:52.823
HEADING THERE
THIS WHOLE TIME.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.260
MENDOZA: LISTEN, IF WE'RE
GOING TO SHUT DOWN

31:54.390 --> 31:56.262
AN ENTIRE CAMPUS
IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES,

31:56.392 --> 31:57.959
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DIVERT ALL OF OUR RESOURCES,

31:58.090 --> 31:59.961
PULL THE UNITS
OFF THE STREETS.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.180
IF WE'RE WRONG.

32:01.310 --> 32:02.921
WE'RE NOT WRONG.
THIS IS HIS FINAL PLAY,

32:03.051 --> 32:04.357
I'M SURE OF IT.

32:04.487 --> 32:07.186
KEEP A LOW PROFILE.
WE DON'T WANT TO PROVOKE HIM.

32:07.316 --> 32:08.970
THAYER HALL,
WHERE TOM ROOMED,

32:09.101 --> 32:10.580
IS DIRECTLY TO
OUR NORTH.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.496
JAMES IS NOT PLANNING ON
WALKING OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

32:13.627 --> 32:16.238
OUR GOAL IS TO ISOLATE
AND DEESCALATE.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.809
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
CLEAR THESE STUDENTS
OUT OF HERE, PLEASE.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.723
THIS WAY.

32:23.942 --> 32:24.855
HEY, GUYS, COULD
I GET YOU TO DO
ME A FAVOR

32:24.986 --> 32:26.031
AND HEAD INDOORS?

32:26.161 --> 32:28.555
ALL RIGHT, MOVE
THESE PEOPLE OUT.

32:29.643 --> 32:32.167
HEY, GUYS. FBI.

32:32.298 --> 32:33.690
WE NEED YOU TO
HEAD INSIDE, OK?

32:33.821 --> 32:34.996
YES, SIR.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.476
ON CHAPTER TWO...

32:36.606 --> 32:38.173
LADIES, I'M WITH
THE FBI.

32:38.304 --> 32:39.958
GO ON.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.222
EVERYBODY PLEASE
JUST HEAD INSIDE.

32:43.352 --> 32:44.963
THANK YOU.

32:49.358 --> 32:52.013
MENDOZA: LADIES, I NEED
YOU TO TAKE IT INDOORS
FOR ME, OK?

32:52.144 --> 32:54.537
GUYS, TAKE IT INDOORS,
PLEASE.

32:54.668 --> 32:57.018
GUYS, TAKE IT INDOORS
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

32:57.149 --> 33:00.021
WILL YOU HEAD INSIDE?
COME ON. COME ON, LET'S GO.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.762
FELLAS, TAKE IT INDOORS
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

33:01.892 --> 33:04.417
GUYS, I NEED YOU TO
TAKE IT INSIDE. LET'S GO.

33:04.547 --> 33:07.768
AAH!

33:09.161 --> 33:10.858
STATUS REPORT.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.469
YEAH, I HEARD IT.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.558
I'M AT 3 O'CLOCK,
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.473
NOTHING TO YOUR SOUTH.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.693
MENDOZA, STATUS.

33:19.823 --> 33:21.956
MENDOZA.
DON'T!

33:22.087 --> 33:23.827
DO YOU COPY?
DON'T!

33:25.133 --> 33:28.571
MISS, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.747
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.749
OK? YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.840
JAMES, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO LET HER GO.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.886
I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME,
ALL RIGHT?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.540
I'M FBI.

33:42.194 --> 33:45.414
A FED.
I'M THE GUY YOU WANT.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.418
OK?

33:53.074 --> 33:55.990
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO
PAY ATTENTION, RIGHT?

33:57.992 --> 33:59.907
LET HER GO.

34:02.910 --> 34:05.739
COME ON, BROTHER.
LET HER GO.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.742
TAKE ME.

34:12.789 --> 34:15.792
COME ON. COME ON.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.534
FBI, GET OUT OF THE WAY.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.930
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.846
AAH!

34:36.074 --> 34:37.510
PRENTISS:
JAMES, DROP THE WEAPON.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.642
WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.
THIS IS OVER NOW.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.427
NO, IT AIN'T.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.733
YOU GONNA FEEL
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.518
YOU GONNA FEEL
WHAT IT'S LIKE

34:45.648 --> 34:47.085
TO WATCH SOMEONE
YOU CARE ABOUT

34:47.215 --> 34:48.869
BLEED TO DEATH
IN FRONT OF YOU.

34:52.002 --> 34:57.182
WE WAITED 27 MINUTES
AND NO ONE CAME.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.835
NO ONE.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.620
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE?

35:00.750 --> 35:02.230
HUH?

35:02.361 --> 35:04.058
TO BE POWERLESS?

35:04.189 --> 35:07.453
YOU THINK HE'S GOT
27 MINUTES?

35:07.583 --> 35:10.238
WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR BROTHER WAS A TRAGEDY.

35:10.369 --> 35:11.457
MISTAKES WERE MADE.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.589
NO! NO.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.852
IT WASN'T A MISTAKE.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.854
AND IT WASN'T
AN ACCIDENT.

35:17.985 --> 35:22.468
THE SYSTEM WORKED
EXACTLY LIKE
IT WAS BUILT TO.

35:26.602 --> 35:30.780
TOM DID EVERYTHING RIGHT,

35:30.911 --> 35:34.784
AND THEY STILL LET HIM
DIE IN THE STREET.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.484
YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.399
IT'S NOT FAIR

35:40.529 --> 35:44.533
AND IT'S NOT EQUAL,
AND THAT HAS TO CHANGE.

35:44.664 --> 35:48.972
BUT WE CAN'T CONTROL
WHAT HAPPENS AROUND US
OR TO US.

35:49.103 --> 35:52.846
WE CAN ONLY CONTROL
HOW WE RESPOND.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.631
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO SHOOT YOU.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.593
DO YOU SEE THOSE
NEWS CREWS OVER THERE?

36:01.855 --> 36:03.639
I'M GONNA LET YOU
TELL YOUR STORY,

36:03.770 --> 36:06.642
SO WE CAN MAKE SURE
THAT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR BROTHER

36:06.773 --> 36:08.601
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

36:19.394 --> 36:21.657
STAY DOWN.
STAY DOWN.

36:21.788 --> 36:22.658
HANDS, HANDS.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.227
I NEED A MEDIC.
WE'VE GOT A MAN DOWN.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.143
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.579
I'VE GOT YOU.
HELP IS COMING.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.146
WE'LL NEED A BOARD.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.975
YOU CAN'T TELL FROM
MY FACE HOW MUCH
THIS HURTS, RIGHT?

36:35.105 --> 36:36.498
NOT AT ALL.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.370
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.155
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.902
LEWIS: HEY.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

36:49.032 --> 36:52.035
YEAH. WE GOT HIM.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.429
THAT WAS A HELL
OF A PUNCH.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.794
PAIN MEDS ARE
SPECTACULAR.

38:40.492 --> 38:44.322
PETER SALAH, THE MAN
OUR WOULD-BE HERO SHOT,

38:44.452 --> 38:45.410
HE'S GONNA PULL THROUGH.

38:45.540 --> 38:46.976
OH, GREAT.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.674

THAT'S GREAT.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.546
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
D.C.'s NEW CELEBRITY.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.114
THEY CAN'T STOP
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.944
LISTEN, YOUR REPUTATION,

38:58.074 --> 39:00.033
IT DOESN'T DO YOU JUSTICE.

39:01.295 --> 39:03.906
PEOPLE TOLD ME
YOU WERE GOOD,

39:04.037 --> 39:07.562
BUT YOU'RE LIKE
REALLY GOOD.

39:07.693 --> 39:11.261
IT'S A GROUP EFFORT.

39:11.392 --> 39:12.785
ANYWAY, WHEN ARE YOU
GETTING OUT OF HERE?

39:12.915 --> 39:15.353
UH, SOON, I HOPE.

39:15.483 --> 39:19.269
UM, MY VITAL ORGANS
ARE IN PLACE,

39:19.400 --> 39:20.793
SO THERE'S THAT.

39:20.923 --> 39:23.056
GOOD.

39:23.186 --> 39:28.844
BECAUSE, UH,
I DID SAVE YOUR LIFE.

39:28.975 --> 39:32.065
LEAST YOU COULD DO IS
BUY ME A BEER OR SOMETHING.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.199
YEAH.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.332
YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.

39:40.203 --> 39:44.991
I MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO
TAKE YOU TO DINNER.

39:46.906 --> 39:49.822
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE
GONNA BE OUT.

39:49.952 --> 39:52.781
MAYBE A BALLGAME.

39:52.912 --> 39:55.393
I COULD GET YOU ONE
OF THOSE LITTLE HATS

39:55.523 --> 39:57.960
WITH ICE CREAM IN IT.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.572
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
INTO THAT KIND OF THING.

40:01.747 --> 40:04.271
WELL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE A DATE.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.535
YEAH.

40:07.666 --> 40:10.495
IT'D BE A DATE.

40:12.279 --> 40:14.194
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
