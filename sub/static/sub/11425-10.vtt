00:04.070 --> 00:06.872
OR "I FEEL" ON A BOAT.

00:06.874 --> 00:09.041
DON'T DO IT.

00:09.043 --> 00:12.144
THAT WHAT MAKES
A CRABBER A CRABBER,

I MEAN, THIS IS OUR LIVELIHOOD
AT STAKE.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.906

WHILE THE REST

04:02.209 --> 04:03.976
KENNY'S JOB
IS TO MAKE SURE

04:03.978 --> 04:07.079
THE BOAT STAYS CLEAR

04:07.081 --> 04:09.681

05:07.508 --> 05:11.610
SO KENNY STRETCHES OUT
ON THE WHEELHOUSE FLOOR.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.925
I WAS RELIEVED BY KENNY.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.134
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.003
I'M HOPING THAT THERE'S, LIKE,
A LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.473
I GOT -- I GOT TO WAKE JAKE UP.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.348

06:38.365 --> 06:39.564
I GOT WOKEN UP BY KENNY.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.566
OLE DIDN'T WAKE ME UP.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.268

07:04.792 --> 07:06.525
NICK, THAT'S NOT
[BLEEP] COOL, DUDE.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.160
I DON'T KNOW
WHO HE THINKS HE IS.

07:08.162 --> 07:11.630
THAT'S A QUICK WAY
TO GET FIRED.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.799
HEY, WILL YOU TELL KENNY
TO COME UPSTAIRS?

07:16.437 --> 07:19.271

07:49.069 --> 07:50.335
OR YOU GET SOMEBODY ELSE.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.436

THAT'S [BLEEP]
STANDARD ISSUE.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.078
YOUR PRIDE
COULD'VE KILLED US.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.546

IT COULD'VE DONE.

08:01.548 --> 08:02.914

DRIVING THE BUS MAN UP THERE

14:14.053 --> 14:16.086
AND CONTROLLING THE BOAT,

14:16.088 --> 14:18.189
SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT
PRETTY BADLY.

14:18.191 --> 14:22.359
SO THANK GOD WE HAVE,
UH, A FAST CAPTAIN.

14:25.097 --> 14:28.032
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO, MY FRIENDS.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.034
MAN, I'M NOT GONNA
GET NOBODY HURT.

14:35.875 --> 14:40.511
Narrator:
THE SUN RISES OVER CALM SEAS.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.913
AFTER TWO DAYS
BATTERING THE FLEET...

14:42.915 --> 14:44.715
Sig: WELL, THIS WEATHER
FINALLY CAME DOWN.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.651
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A DAY
AND A HALF OF STORM.

14:47.653 --> 14:50.421
TOOK SOME BIG HITS.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.822
Narrator:
...THE FIRST ARCTIC HURRICANE

14:51.824 --> 14:56.026
OF THE SEASON
DEPARTS THE FISHING GROUNDS.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.162
LAST NIGHT'S RIDE
WAS ONE OF THE WORST

14:58.164 --> 15:00.264
I'VE HAD ON THIS BOAT.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.033
IT WAS QUITE THE STORM.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.535
<i>-HEY, EDGAR.</i>
-WHAT?

15:04.537 --> 15:07.505

AND HERE
YOU CAN FEEL IT BOWED.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.615
YOU CAN FEEL IT HERE.

THAT'S ANOTHER 100,000 BUCKS.

15:19.986 --> 15:23.888
Narrator:
...AND TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.289
Bill: WE NEED TO SEE
SOME NUMBERS TODAY.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.357
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.425
WE NEED TO SOME LIFE.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.793
TIME'S TICKING.

15:29.795 --> 15:31.495
TIME TO START MAKING SOME MONEY.

15:31.497 --> 15:34.632
Narrator: NOW CAPTAINS SCRAMBLE
TO FILL THEIR TANKS...

15:34.634 --> 15:36.033
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN WORKING
IN A STORM FOR THE LAST DAY

15:36.035 --> 15:38.769
AND A HALF.
NOBODY'S GOT ANY CRAB ON YET.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.340
Narrator: ...WHILE THE BERING
SEA GIVES THEM A CHANCE.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.210
WE GOT 300,000 POUNDS TO CATCH.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.178
AND I'M GONNA FIND A WAY
TO CATCH 'EM.

15:53.786 --> 15:58.088

I CAN SEE MY BAGS.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.299
Narrator: ...CAPTAIN-IN-TRAINING
JOSH HARRIS

16:08.301 --> 16:09.967

16:14.106 --> 16:15.506
WE'RE MAKING MONEY.

MAKING GOOD MONEY.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.777
Narrator:
FOR THE WINTER SEASON...

16:19.779 --> 16:22.813
OH, YEAH, JOSH IS TAKING OVER

DOING PRETTY GOOD.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.251
Narrator:
...JOSH IS RUNNING THE SHOW.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.219
OH, THE POTS ARE GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.359
WE HAVE A DELIVERY DATE
WE HAVE TO MEET.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.660
AND I'LL BE A MONKEY'S UNCLE

16:36.662 --> 16:39.196
IF WE DON'T MEET IT
ON MY FIRST GO-ROUND.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.831
Narrator:
AND BEING IN CHARGE...

16:40.833 --> 16:42.366
Josh:
THIS IS A BUSINESS NOW,

16:42.368 --> 16:44.335
AND SO WE ARE REPLACING HIM NOW.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.771
Narrator:
...MAKES HIM ACCOUNTABLE
TO PARTNERS WHO DEMAND RESULTS.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.808

16:50.810 --> 16:52.576
LET'S MAKE SURE
WE GET EVERYTHING

16:52.578 --> 16:54.011
THAT WE'RE
COMMITTED TO, OKAY.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.646
YEAH, ROGER.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.985
<i>WHAT DO YOU SEE?</i>

17:00.987 --> 17:03.120
Narrator: ONE KEY STEP
IN MAINTAINING

17:03.122 --> 17:04.588
A SUCCESSFUL CRAB BUSINESS...

17:10.429 --> 17:13.731
...KNOWING HOW TO COUNT.

17:13.733 --> 17:14.932
20...

17:14.934 --> 17:16.599
WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS THAT?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.240
THAT COUNT SEEMS OFF.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.409
THAT'S GONNA SCREW UP OUR
NUMBERS COME TIME TO DELIVER.

17:25.411 --> 17:28.579
I MEAN, IF WE'RE GONNA
BE HITTING, UH,

17:28.581 --> 17:30.514
HITTING A SET POUNDAGE,
IT'S JUST GONNA BE

17:30.516 --> 17:31.715
AWFULLY HARD TO DO

17:31.717 --> 17:33.350
IF WE DON'T HAVE
AN ACCURATE AMOUNT OF CRAB.

17:33.352 --> 17:34.685
Narrator:
COMING IN LIGHT OR HEAVY

17:34.687 --> 17:38.422
COSTS THE BOAT THOUSANDS
IN FUEL AND BAIT,

17:38.424 --> 17:41.492
AS WELL AS TIME ON THE WATER.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.293
2 AND 2? 22 NOW.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.262
DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THERE
WAS THAT MANY TO ME.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.503
[BLEEP]
LOOKING GOOD.

18:00.312 --> 18:01.779
Casey: WHAT WAS THAT NUMBER
HE GAVE YOU?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.081
-75.
-DUDE.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.215
YEAH, IT DOESN'T --

18:05.217 --> 18:06.650
THAT LOOKS LIKE WAY
MORE THAN 75.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.219
IT'S DEFINITELY
MORE THAN 75.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.454
NO, THERE'S TWO THINGS

18:10.456 --> 18:13.424
THAT I HAVE NO PATIENCE
FOR -- INCOMPETENCE

18:13.426 --> 18:16.527
WHEN IT COMES TO DOING YOUR JOB,
NUMBER TWO, LAZINESS.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.262
IT'S A NEW GROUP
OF GUYS GETTING TOGETHER.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.031
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS
TO COME OVER TIME, YOU KNOW?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.199
YOU GOT TO SEE
WHERE THEIR STRENGTHS

18:22.201 --> 18:24.201
AND WEAKNESSES ARE
AND YOU BUILD FROM THERE.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.071
THESE GUYS
KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.306
SO IT'S NOT INCOMPETENCE.
-OH, I KNOW.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.442
A CONVERSATION
WITH THE CREW

18:31.444 --> 18:33.744
MIGHT BE
IN ORDER THERE, BUDDY.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.412
ALL RIGHT.
NICE WORK, BOYS.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.317
I'LL -- I'LL TALK
TO THE GUYS ABOUT THIS.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.619
I'M GONNA TRY SOMETHING --
TRY SOMETHING NEW.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.254
AND I'LL DO IT MY WAY SO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.123
I GOT THIS.
-THAT'S FINE, JOSH.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.591
-JUST GIVE ME A SEC.
-YOU CAN CODDLE YOUR KIDS

18:47.593 --> 18:48.992
IF YOU WANT.
I'M GONNA SPANK MINE.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.494
WE'LL SEE
WHO TURNS OUT BETTER.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.663
Narrator:
FOR CO-CAPTAIN CASEY McMANUS,

18:52.665 --> 18:56.100
THE CREW'S BAD MATH CALLS
FOR AN OLD-SCHOOL SOLUTION.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.135
NO, I GOT THIS.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.470
THIS IS MY SPEECH.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.073
BUT JOSH PREFERS THE CARROT
TO THE STICK.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.743
Josh: ALL RIGHT.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.778
SO AFTER WATCHING
ALL OF YOU GUYS

19:07.780 --> 19:09.646

19:09.648 --> 19:11.582
LET'S WORK
ON THE COUNT, ALL RIGHT?

19:11.584 --> 19:12.750
SERIOUSLY.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.184
I'M GONNA TEST YOU
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.820
THIS IS REAL SIMPLE.
THIS IS VERY SIMPLE.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.889
BUT IF YOU'RE WRONG
ON THE COUNT...

19:18.891 --> 19:20.691
-UH-HUH.
-...BY MORE THAN TWO CRAB,

19:20.693 --> 19:23.994
THEN [BLEEP]
YOU OWE ME 100 BUCKS.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.429
NOW, IF YOU'RE RIGHT...

19:25.431 --> 19:26.797
I'LL GIVE YOU 100 BUCKS.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.365
[BLEEP] YEAH.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.667
SOUNDS GOOD, JOSH.
I LIKE THAT.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.770
ALL RIGHT.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.872

IN YOU AND GOOD TALK.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.449
-WHAT IN THE [BLEEP]
-JOSH IS TOO NICE.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.686
Josh: IF IT LOOKS
LIKE THE COUNTS ARE OFF,

19:49.688 --> 19:50.954
I'M JUST GONNA CALL 'EM OUT.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.656
AND WE'LL PLAY A LITTLE GAME.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.425
AND IF THEY'RE WRONG, THEN
THEY'RE GONNA OWE ME SOME MONEY.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.660
AND IF THEY'RE RIGHT, WELL,

19:56.662 --> 19:58.395
THEN I GUESS WE'LL HAVE
TO FORK OUT SOME CASH.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.464
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

20:00.466 --> 20:03.033
SO THIS IS
MIND-[BLEEP]-OLOGY 101.

Narrator: 195 MILES
NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR...

20:18.819 --> 20:22.420
SOMETHING EXCITING IS GOING
TO HAPPEN TODAY, I'M SURE.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.489
Narrator:
...ON THE 110-FOOT <i> BRENNA A...</i>

20:24.491 --> 20:26.324
Sean: THE WEATHER'S REALLY NICE
RIGHT NOW.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.092
I MAY HAVE BEEN THE LAST ONE
TO LEAVE TOWN,

20:28.094 --> 20:31.162
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.

20:31.164 --> 20:33.465
Narrator: AFTER WAITING OUT
THE STORM IN PORT...

20:33.467 --> 20:36.734

BAIRDI, BABY.

20:48.215 --> 20:52.484

THAT WE CATCH HERE IS,

20:52.486 --> 20:54.052
UH, GOING TO SIG.

20:54.054 --> 20:56.120
THAT'S THE LEFTOVER
FROM LAST SEASON.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.189
THE WORD IS OUT.
YEP, WE'RE HERE TO STAY.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.191

<i>FIRST POT IS GOING OVER.</i>

21:20.847 --> 21:22.080
START OF A NEW SEASON,

21:22.082 --> 21:23.982
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, REALLY.

21:23.984 --> 21:28.319
BUT THIS IS A SPOT JUST WEST
OF WHERE I WAS LAST TIME

21:28.321 --> 21:30.622
THAT I SAW
SOME GOOD ACTIVITY AT.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.793
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
I'VE GOT THE STRATEGY.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.929
BUT, UH, IT'S HARD TO SAY

21:37.931 --> 21:40.231
WHO'S BEEN FISHING HERE
WHILE I WAS GONE.

21:40.233 --> 21:46.404
SO...I COULD BE
ON OLD GROUND RIGHT NOW.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.607
IT'S TIED,
GETTING IN THE WATER.

21:51.011 --> 21:53.912
BANGING IT OUT ALL DAY.

21:53.914 --> 21:57.015
THE GUYS ARE READY TO GO.
I'M EXCITED, TOO.

21:57.017 --> 21:59.617
I'M READY TO GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.387
HERE WE GO!

22:02.389 --> 22:05.590
WHOO-HOO!

22:05.592 --> 22:09.394
START OF BAIRDI 2016.

22:13.567 --> 22:15.867
Narrator:
110 MILES NORTHWEST...

22:18.038 --> 22:19.571
Man: I'M COUNTING
HERE, KYLE.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.108
...ON THE <i> CORNELIA MARIE...</i>

22:24.110 --> 22:26.711
WHAT'D WE GET
FOR A NUMBER, 70?

22:26.713 --> 22:28.880
65.

22:28.882 --> 22:30.081
Casey: I GOT 92.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.317
WE GOT TO MAKE SURE
WE GET THESE NUMBERS RIGHT,

22:32.319 --> 22:33.384
MAN, I MEAN,
SINCE WE HAVE TO KNOW

22:33.386 --> 22:34.986
WHAT'S GOING
IN THE TANKS.

22:34.988 --> 22:36.754
Narrator:
CONCERN OVER THE CRAB COUNT

22:36.756 --> 22:38.890
HAS CAPTAIN-TO-BE JOSH HARRIS

22:38.892 --> 22:41.426
PROVIDING SOME EXTRA MOTIVATION
TO HIS CREW.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.861
BET WAS, IF THEY WERE WRONG
ON THEIR COUNT,

22:43.863 --> 22:45.363
THEN THEY'D OWE ME 100 BUCKS.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.965
IF THEY WERE
RIGHT ON THEIR COUNT

22:46.967 --> 22:48.967
AND I CALLED 'EM ON IT,
THEN I'D OWE THEM 100 BUCKS.

22:48.969 --> 22:50.602
SO...

22:50.604 --> 22:52.203
I THINK IT'S GONNA
BE INTERESTING TO SEE

22:52.205 --> 22:54.138
HOW JOSH'S LITTLE STRATEGY
WORKS HERE. I DON'T KNOW.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.740
SOME SKIPPERS DO IT
WITH AN ASS CHEWING.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.042
JOSH WANTS TO TURN IT
INTO A GAME, SO...

22:58.044 --> 23:00.545
Josh: LET'S WIN SOME MONEY.
I'LL SPLIT IT WITH YOU.

23:15.662 --> 23:18.062
I'LL [BLEEP] PULL THE [BLEEP]
CARD ON THAT, BITCH.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.130
LET'S DO IT.

23:19.132 --> 23:22.033
-WHOO!
<i>-ALL RIGHT.</i>

23:22.035 --> 23:24.502
<i>EVERYBODY, STOP</i>
<i>WHAT YOU'RE DOING.</i>

23:24.504 --> 23:26.437
LET'S [BLEEP]

23:26.439 --> 23:27.905
DUMP IT OUT ON THERE.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.607
AND, ONE CRAB AT A TIME,

23:29.609 --> 23:33.144
I WANT TO SEE 'EM DUMPED
INTO THAT TOTE.

23:33.146 --> 23:35.980

23:56.603 --> 23:58.136
AND WHAT ELSE IS BEHIND THERE?

23:58.138 --> 23:59.237
I WANT TO KNOW
THERE'S [BLEEP] --

23:59.239 --> 24:00.772
<i>IF IT WAS -- YEAH.</i>

24:00.774 --> 24:02.073

24:17.157 --> 24:20.658
WHERE THEY MESSED UP
IS THEY MADE A DEAL WITH JOSH.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.394

25:12.345 --> 25:14.011
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER

25:14.013 --> 25:15.680
HONEST NUMBERS.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.985
SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY
KIND OF HAVING FUN WITH IT.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.954
THEY'RE EXCITED
TO PLAY THE GAME.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.522

25:44.477 --> 25:45.743
ABOUT THE CHANCE
TO WIN 100 BUCKS

25:45.745 --> 25:48.312
OR IF THEY'RE EXCITED
TO JUST PROVE JOSH WRONG,

25:48.314 --> 25:49.680
BUT...

25:49.682 --> 25:53.417
...JOSH'S GAME HAS THE CREW
NAILING THE COUNTS.

25:53.419 --> 25:56.287
EITHER WAY,
THE NUMBERS ARE RIGHT ON.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.456
NOW THEY'RE GETTING SO USED
TO COMMUNICATING

25:58.458 --> 25:59.724
TO TRY TO BEAT ME AT THIS GAME,

25:59.726 --> 26:01.726
THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THE MOST ACCURATE COUNT

26:01.728 --> 26:05.329

Narrator: SO FAR, HE HAS YET
TO FIND A SCHOOL OF CRAB.

26:52.645 --> 26:55.713

RIGHT HERE ARE DIFFERENT DEPTHS.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.849
SO RIGHT HERE,
I GOT TO SET 'EM TIGHT

26:57.851 --> 26:59.884
SO I CAN CROSS
ALL THESE DEPTHS.

27:01.721 --> 27:05.523
EVERY SINGLE POT MATTERS.
WE CAN'T HAVE ROOM FOR ERROR.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.527
I NEED EVERY POT

27:28.147 --> 27:29.547
ARE YOU [BLEEP] SERIOUS?
-LAUNCHED IT!

27:29.549 --> 27:31.282
I STILL HAD MY FINGERS
IN THERE.

27:31.284 --> 27:32.750
HEY, I'LL GET THE BUOYS, MAN.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.851
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE BUOYS.

I'LL GET THE BUOYS.
GET THE DOOR.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.722
Narrator:
TO KEEP THE CRAB FROM ESCAPING,

27:37.724 --> 27:41.392
THE DOOR MUST BE SHUT
AND LATCHED DOWN.

27:41.394 --> 27:43.461
Kenny: I JUST GOT MY HAND
OUT OF THERE.

27:43.463 --> 27:45.496
IT WAS GOING OVER.

27:45.498 --> 27:48.666
SO I JUST -- HANDS OUT.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.135
I'M NOT GOING OVER.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.403
Jake: KENNY DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING TO SEAN

27:52.405 --> 27:55.006
AND JUST LET IT [BLEEP] GO
AND LET HIM DUMP IT.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.141
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THAT
AND YELLED OUT TO SEAN

27:57.143 --> 27:58.576
THAT IT WASN'T TIED.

27:58.578 --> 28:00.845
HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T THROW US
OFF THE [BLEEP] CRAB

28:00.847 --> 28:02.480
JUST 'CAUSE
OF A STUPID DOOR TIE.

28:02.482 --> 28:03.814
IT'S JUST A GOOD THING
I CAUGHT IT.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.683
YEAH, I'M GONNA TURN

Man: WE GOT TO GO BACK,

28:30.410 --> 28:33.945
<i>MAKE SURE, PLEASE MAKE SURE</i>

28:48.761 --> 28:50.294
Kenny: JUST A MISTAKE.

28:50.296 --> 28:54.565
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AND FIX IT,
SO I'LL STILL MAKE MONEY.

28:57.670 --> 29:00.638
GUYS, GET IT ON BOARD
AND DUMP IT BACK, ASAP.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.009
BLATANT DISREGARD.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.045
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.448
KENNY IS DEFINITELY
A BOUNDARY PUSHER.

29:10.450 --> 29:12.350
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

29:12.352 --> 29:14.318
HE THINKS HE KNOWS BEST.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.553
AND HE DOESN'T.

29:15.555 --> 29:18.656
GOD, IT'S REALLY MESSED UP
MY MOJO, MAN.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.626
JUST GOT TO BE PATIENT.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.829

PATIENT.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.064
I GOT TO REMAIN CALM.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.900
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO FREAK OUT.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.039
I CAN FREAK OUT

29:35.041 --> 29:36.474
WHEN I'VE GOT TIME
TO FREAK OUT.

29:36.476 --> 29:40.011
I DON'T GOT TIME
TO FREAK OUT RIGHT NOW.

29:40.013 --> 29:42.847
THIS IS SERIOUS.
THIS REALLY IS SERIOUS.

29:44.417 --> 29:45.783
I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY CALM,

29:45.785 --> 29:48.319
SO I -- I HAVE TO FORGIVE KENNY.

29:48.321 --> 29:50.621
BECAUSE I WILL LOSE MY MIND.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.023

TO MAKE AS A CAPTAIN.

36:14.407 --> 36:15.773
Narrator: ...ON THE <i> SAGA.</i>

36:15.775 --> 36:19.710
Jake: FROM 83 FATHOMS
TO NOW, WE'RE IN 72.

36:19.712 --> 36:24.348
AND, UH, THAT'S -- THAT'S A --
IT'S A BIG AREA TO COVER.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.783
SO WE'RE GONNA SEE HERE,
COMING UP.

36:25.785 --> 36:27.985
THE FIRST POT'S COMING UP.

36:27.987 --> 36:31.155
Narrator: AFTER SPREADING HIS
POTS ACROSS THE OPILIO GROUNDS,

36:31.157 --> 36:34.892
CAPTAIN JAKE ANDERSON
AWAITS HIS FATE.

36:34.894 --> 36:37.961
Jake: COULD VERY WELL COME UP
BLANK, AND I DON'T KNOW.

36:40.800 --> 36:44.535
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

36:44.537 --> 36:45.869
I AM.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.604
COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.640
AND I HAVE TODAY
AND TOMORROW TO FISH.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.711
HERE IT COMES.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.513
<i>IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.</i>

37:00.886 --> 37:03.353
-WHOO!
-YEAH!

37:03.355 --> 37:04.922
LOTS OF 'EM.

37:04.924 --> 37:07.691
AW, THERE'S CRAB IN IT, DUDE.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.094
THERE'S LOTS OF CRAB IN THERE.

37:10.096 --> 37:11.829
CASH MONEY!

37:11.831 --> 37:14.565
BIG MONEY, BABY!

37:14.567 --> 37:15.732
OH, MY GOD.

37:15.734 --> 37:19.002
THERE'S TONS!

37:19.004 --> 37:21.171
<i>YEAH!</i>

37:21.173 --> 37:24.074
<i>LOOK AT THAT!</i>

37:24.076 --> 37:25.309
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT.

37:28.948 --> 37:31.048
-2-9-0!
<i>-290?</i>

37:32.952 --> 37:35.052
YEAH, GUYS, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.156
IT'S -- IT'S LOOKING UP.

37:39.158 --> 37:42.860
Jake: <i> OKAY.</i>
<i>SO IF THIS COMES UP WITH CRAB,</i>

37:42.862 --> 37:44.962
<i>THEN WE KNOW THEY'RE HERE.</i>

37:44.964 --> 37:46.597
<i>WE'RE ON THE MEAT.</i>

37:49.735 --> 37:51.235
WE STILL GOT CRAB!

37:51.237 --> 37:53.303
THAT'S A BIG BOY!

37:53.305 --> 37:55.639
500.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.308
75 FATHOMS
SEEMS TO BE THE SWEET SPOT.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.710
AND THEY'RE NOT MOVING.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.411
I KNEW THEY WERE HERE.

38:01.413 --> 38:04.882
I JUST COULDN'T GET TO 'EM.

38:04.884 --> 38:06.316
PICKING AND GRINNING.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.452
IT MEANS A LOT -- IT'S A LOT --
THERE'S A LOT OF CRAB.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.771
HEY, KENNY, SLOW THE BLOCK DOWN.

38:27.773 --> 38:29.606
YOU GOT TO SLOW THE BLOCK DOWN.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.275
SLOW IT DOWN.

38:36.015 --> 38:38.248
SLOW THE [BLEEP]
BLOCK DOWN, KENNY!

38:38.250 --> 38:40.584
[BLEEP]

38:40.586 --> 38:42.953
GUY DOES NOT LISTEN.

38:42.955 --> 38:45.222
KENNY'S GOT
A SERIOUS LISTENING PROBLEM.

38:45.224 --> 38:46.356
THEN HE BACKTALKS.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.991
JUST SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.160
NOW YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF.

38:50.162 --> 38:53.697
KENNY ONLY THINKS ABOUT KENNY.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.199
I WAS JUST
[BLEEP] AROUND.

38:55.201 --> 38:57.034
I THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING FUN.

38:57.036 --> 38:59.102
DON'T [BLEEP] TALK BACK!

38:59.104 --> 39:02.005
YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT [BLEEP]
WORSE ON YOURSELF.

39:04.944 --> 39:06.410
HE'S BAD-MOUTHING ME RIGHT NOW

39:06.412 --> 39:08.278
LIKE HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.114
ON ANY OTHER BOAT,
YOU'D JUST GET FIRED FOR THAT.

39:11.116 --> 39:14.084
IT WAS ONE TIME.

39:14.086 --> 39:15.485
HE MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.421
AND IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.922
Man: HE DON'T LISTEN WHEN PEOPLE
TELL HIM TO DO STUFF.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.457
THEN HE GETS THIS ATTITUDE.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.126
HE'S THIS LITTLE HALF SHARE
WITH THE FULL-SHARE ATTITUDE.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.195
NOBODY LIKES THAT CRAP
AROUND HERE.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.764
WE'RE SICK OF IT.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.766
IT'S OKAY, KENNY.
LET'S [BLEEP] MOVE ON.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.168
LET'S JAM, DOG.
ALL RIGHT?

39:31.170 --> 39:32.336
ALL IS FORGIVEN, KENNY.

39:32.338 --> 39:34.905
YOU'RE [BLEEP] AWESOME.
JUST BE HAPPY.

39:34.907 --> 39:36.740
HOW ABOUT YOU JUST SHUT UP
AND GIVE ME A SMILE?

39:36.742 --> 39:37.908
COME HERE.
SMILE.

39:37.910 --> 39:38.842
SMILE.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.377
I FEEL THE WAY I FEEL!

39:40.379 --> 39:41.912
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO FEEL!

39:41.914 --> 39:43.413
THAT'S MY [BLEEP] FEELING!

39:43.415 --> 39:45.148
<i>DON'T TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL.</i>

39:45.150 --> 39:47.384
I DON'T CARE HOW YOU FEEL.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.652
I HAVE A [BLEEP] JOB TO DO.

39:48.654 --> 39:49.987
WE'RE [BLEEP] CRABBERS.

39:49.989 --> 39:51.922
[BLEEP] JAKE.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.527
KENNY, GET YOUR [BLEEP]
ASS OFF THE DECK.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.363
GET YOUR [BLEEP] ASS
OFF THE DECK.

39:59.365 --> 40:00.931
TAKE YOUR [BLEEP] OFF.

40:00.933 --> 40:03.367
GET THE [BLEEP]
OFF THE DECK RIGHT NOW!

40:03.369 --> 40:06.303
GET THE [BLEEP] OFF MY DECK!

40:06.305 --> 40:07.404
REALLY?

40:07.406 --> 40:08.705
RIGHT NOW!

40:08.707 --> 40:10.207
RIGHT [BLEEP] NOW!

40:10.209 --> 40:11.708
REALLY?

40:11.710 --> 40:13.744
<i>YOU [BLEEP] MOVE,</i>
<i>MOTHER [BLEEP]</i>

40:21.887 --> 40:24.388
[BLEEP] ABOUT TO HIT THE FAN,
IS WHAT'S GOING ON.

40:24.390 --> 40:28.125
Jake: [BLEEP]
TIRED OF THIS [BLEEP]

40:28.127 --> 40:30.927
[BLEEP] OFF, OLE.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.263
HAUL THOSE MOTHER [BLEEP]
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

40:33.265 --> 40:36.133
I'M SICK OF THIS LITTLE,
WHINY LITTLE BITCH.

40:36.135 --> 40:38.869
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

40:38.871 --> 40:40.771
-WHERE IS HE?
-WHAT?

40:40.773 --> 40:42.372
Kenny:
NO, I'M NOT GOING OFF DECK.

40:42.374 --> 40:44.574
I'M NOT LEAVING
THESE GUYS TO...

40:44.576 --> 40:46.209
NOPE, I'M NOT.

40:48.414 --> 40:49.780
Man: DUDE,
YOU ARE GONNA GET...

40:49.782 --> 40:51.081
I WOULD DO WHAT HE SAYS.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.716
-HONESTLY, AS A...
-GO TALK TO HIM.

40:52.718 --> 40:55.719
I WOULD GO INSIDE
AND DO EXACTLY AS HE SAYS.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.454
THIS IS
WHAT PISSES HIM OFF.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.056
YOU DON'T DO
WHAT HE SAYS.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.996
Kenny: JAKE. JAKE.

41:05.998 --> 41:07.230
JAKE, HEY.
I DON'T --

41:07.232 --> 41:09.433
Jake: SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP.
GET OFF THE DECK.

41:09.435 --> 41:10.534
I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE THE GUYS.

41:10.536 --> 41:11.468
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
FROM YOU RIGHT NOW. HEY.

41:11.470 --> 41:12.769
[BLEEP] YOU!

41:12.771 --> 41:14.037
I'LL GET A REAL DECKHAND
OUT THERE.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.205
I WAS JUST --
I WAS MESSING...

41:15.207 --> 41:16.640
SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP.
SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.542
I THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING FUN AGAIN.

41:18.544 --> 41:19.676
SERIOUSLY,
I REALLY DID.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.379
YOU SHOULDN'T OPEN
YOUR [BLEEP] MOUTH.

41:22.381 --> 41:24.047
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

41:28.020 --> 41:29.786
GOT A REAL [BLEEP]
DECKHAND OUT HERE, BOYS.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.889
YEAH, BUDDY.

41:32.891 --> 41:36.593
HE DOESN'T WANT ME AROUND HIM,
YOU KNOW.

41:42.534 --> 41:45.135
[BLEEP]
GET OUT OF MY [BLEEP]

41:45.137 --> 41:47.637
JUST GONNA LET HIM DO IT.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.072
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DEAL WITH THIS [BLEEP]

41:49.074 --> 41:50.741
PETTY [BLEEP]

41:50.743 --> 41:51.875
I HAVE A RELIEF SKIPPER.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.710
HE CAN [BLEEP] HAUL
THIS [BLEEP]

41:53.712 --> 41:55.979
KENNY WANTS TO TALK
ALL THE [BLEEP] HE WANTS.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.381
HE DON'T KNOW [BLEEP]

41:57.383 --> 41:59.816
I DON'T NEED HIM OUT HERE.
I'LL COME OUT HERE.

41:59.818 --> 42:02.452
[BLEEP] I'LL DO BAIT.
I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP]

42:02.454 --> 42:06.623
AS LONG AS THIS OPERATION
KEEPS GOING, THAT'S MY JOB.

42:06.625 --> 42:11.561
AND RIGHT NOW, THE PROCESS
IS SLOWING BECAUSE OF KENNY.

42:11.563 --> 42:16.099
AND I CAN ONLY [BLEEP]
TOLERATE IT SO MUCH.

42:16.101 --> 42:18.668
BUT HE IS GONNA LEARN,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

42:18.670 --> 42:19.936
HE DON'T KNOW [BLEEP]
