WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:05.624
Come on, pay up your taxes.

00:05.659 --> 00:08.401
Guards, take this to the Sheriff.

00:10.059 --> 00:12.687
Taxes, we do not like.

00:15.899 --> 00:17.719
Well done, lads!

00:18.619 --> 00:20.780
Hello, there.

00:25.779 --> 00:27.747
We're winning.

00:31.819 --> 00:33.544
Sorry, my Lord.

00:33.579 --> 00:36.104
Come on, we are really winning.

00:36.139 --> 00:38.584
And there's one more prize.

00:38.619 --> 00:41.144
If we really wanna
beat the Sheriff...

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:56.779 --> 00:58.984
How do we know there
even is a Strong Room?

00:59.019 --> 01:01.943
A wild guess. How do you think?
A little bird told him.

01:01.978 --> 01:05.465
A little Marian bird. Mmmm.

01:05.501 --> 01:06.665
This is it.

01:11.619 --> 01:14.744
Djaq. This?

01:14.779 --> 01:16.281
It's just a door.

01:16.316 --> 01:17.783
No handle, no lock.

01:21.259 --> 01:24.004
Robin!
GASPS

01:24.039 --> 01:26.428
I do not like this.

01:26.463 --> 01:27.909
Will?

01:35.459 --> 01:38.622
Will, what's this?
Much, don't touch that!

01:40.379 --> 01:42.024
Why do I do it?!

01:42.059 --> 01:45.483
Right, let's check it out...
Look, look, look!

01:45.518 --> 01:47.743
Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!

01:52.839 --> 01:54.864
What is this?

01:54.899 --> 01:57.060
The Sheriff's war chest.

01:58.339 --> 02:00.387
And that, is our poor chest, lads!

02:02.419 --> 02:05.364
DOGS BARK

02:05.399 --> 02:06.969
We're not equipped for this.

02:07.004 --> 02:08.443
Robin! Dogs!

02:08.479 --> 02:11.983
I know. But we'll be back.

02:53.959 --> 02:56.564
Am I to drown
in everybody else's incompetence,

02:56.599 --> 03:01.923
whilst Robin Hood steals everything
that is rightfully mine?! No!

03:01.958 --> 03:04.264
Do something about it, Gisborne!

03:04.299 --> 03:06.524
My Lord, we now know
the Strong Room works.

03:06.559 --> 03:12.400
It stopped Hood dead in his tracks. Not dead
enough! Stealing our money from me on the way here

03:12.435 --> 03:18.241
is one thing. Stealing it from right under my
very nose is another! The Black Knights are coming,

03:18.276 --> 03:22.926
expecting their share out, Gisborne! At
this rate, there'll be nothing left to share!

03:22.961 --> 03:26.161
I want Hood caught, Gisborne.

03:26.196 --> 03:27.922
I want him dead!

03:30.159 --> 03:33.284
Meanwhile, how's your German?

03:33.319 --> 03:37.120
German? Pat, woman, pat! Don't rub.

03:37.155 --> 03:40.884
Ah, this guest you're expecting? Yes.

03:40.919 --> 03:46.323
Count Friedrich of Bavaria is one of the
richest aristocrats in Europe, by all accounts.

03:46.358 --> 03:49.284
And stupid, too...

03:49.319 --> 03:53.301
so you and he should get on.
He also has a weakness for gambling.

03:53.336 --> 03:55.584
Your alterations to the Great Hall?
Yes.

03:55.619 --> 04:01.524
We will extend the count every courtesy, Gisborne.
I've taken my bath six months early for a reason.

04:01.559 --> 04:07.446
And then we shall take the inbred
booby for every penny he's got.

04:23.239 --> 04:27.881
The Sheriff wanted me
to thank you all for your hard work

04:27.916 --> 04:29.484
building his new Strong Room.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.659
Slave labour, more like.
Where's our money?

04:34.339 --> 04:36.102
You'll get what's coming to you.

04:38.199 --> 04:39.624
Now...

04:39.659 --> 04:44.847
How did Robin Hood
find out about the Strong Room?

04:46.139 --> 04:50.929
Somebody... must have told him.

04:52.739 --> 04:57.164
Loose talk costs lives.

05:04.699 --> 05:08.009
Good. Very good.

05:09.539 --> 05:12.464
This world is full of idiots,

05:12.499 --> 05:15.184
waiting to be parted
from their money.

05:15.219 --> 05:16.680
But, as you know...

05:18.779 --> 05:20.622
...the house always wins.

05:20.657 --> 05:22.624
LAUGHTER

05:22.659 --> 05:25.583
Now, I've had this table put here
in the middle,

05:25.618 --> 05:28.344
because dice
is the count's favourite game,

05:28.379 --> 05:31.485
and this is the first thing
I want him to see when he arrives.

05:32.659 --> 05:34.741
Good. Carry on.

05:36.219 --> 05:39.864
Ah! Lady Marian, there you are.

05:39.899 --> 05:44.321
Now, our guest
is due to arrive shortly,

05:44.356 --> 05:48.704
and I'd like you to
be a friend to him.

05:48.739 --> 05:53.950
I'd like you to make him feel that
his every desire is yours to obey.

05:53.985 --> 05:56.152
Every desire? Mmm.

05:56.187 --> 05:58.320
Show him a good time.

06:00.079 --> 06:02.809
What do you think, Gisborne?
Good idea.

06:03.619 --> 06:05.704
No, I won't!

06:05.739 --> 06:08.144
Yes, you will, missy.

06:08.179 --> 06:10.386
How's your father, so to speak?

06:10.421 --> 06:13.184
Frail.

06:13.219 --> 06:14.823
House arrest doesn't help.

06:14.858 --> 06:17.128
But very much alive.

06:20.619 --> 06:22.984
What if he sees my heart isn't in it?

06:23.019 --> 06:26.329
Well, then pretend.
Deception comes easily enough to you

06:28.139 --> 06:31.984
Now, when the count arrives,
I want you to smile for him,

06:32.019 --> 06:33.784
and buy yourself a gown that...

06:33.819 --> 06:38.529
how shall I say?
Stimulates the imagination.

06:41.459 --> 06:43.268
The cheaper the better, I think.

06:50.459 --> 06:51.960
Fetch.

06:59.299 --> 07:01.384
Stand further off.

07:01.419 --> 07:04.946
You make me feel
as if I am under arrest.

07:07.299 --> 07:09.381
Trinkets for the lovely lady?

07:19.539 --> 07:21.224
You call this fresh?!

07:21.259 --> 07:24.160
You can't expect
people to eat this muck!

07:28.019 --> 07:30.783
Hey! Stop it! What are you doing?!

07:30.818 --> 07:32.864
GRUNTING

07:32.899 --> 07:36.107
They have you well guarded.
Why did I choose this?

07:36.142 --> 07:39.024
I can hardly breathe in there. Shhh.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.879
What happened? They're expecting
a guest today, a rich German count,

07:42.914 --> 07:46.666
and they're making me fawn over him,
making me dress up... A German?

07:46.701 --> 07:50.384
Do you thing the Sheriff and Prince
John looking for allies abroad?

07:50.419 --> 07:55.061
He's not an ally, he's a gambler. The Sheriff
has set up gaming tables in the castle.

07:55.096 --> 07:59.541
He's planning to fill his new Strong
Room with the count's money. You see?

07:59.576 --> 08:02.424
Another good reason to rob him.

08:02.459 --> 08:05.223
Robin, please,
do not go down there, it's dangerous.

08:05.258 --> 08:06.804
You know me.

08:06.839 --> 08:08.340
I like a challenge.

08:11.219 --> 08:12.924
You don't have to do this!

08:12.959 --> 08:17.692
Yes, I do. Without me, you wouldn't even know
there was a Strong Room. "England needs me?"

08:17.727 --> 08:21.395
Yes. England needs me.
England needs us.

08:21.430 --> 08:25.121
And I need you.

08:28.337 --> 08:29.725
Guard?

08:31.301 --> 08:33.388
We need to break
into the Strong Room,

08:33.423 --> 08:35.811
and Stephen was the first person
I thought of.

08:35.846 --> 08:39.212
Is he a friend of your father's?
A teacher. A legend in his day.

08:39.248 --> 08:42.457
He used to be famous.
He worked in the Orient.

08:42.493 --> 08:46.645
They were his apprentices
Gisborne's lot killed this morning.

08:47.599 --> 08:49.123
Will?

08:51.023 --> 08:55.092
Still passionate? Angry?

08:55.127 --> 08:58.290
A lot to be angry about.
True. And your skills?

08:58.325 --> 09:02.392
You're using them, not wasting them?

09:02.427 --> 09:05.115
I'm with Robin Hood. Good.

09:05.150 --> 09:06.845
That is not a waste.

09:10.225 --> 09:12.990
Do not touch that, please.

09:13.025 --> 09:16.153
I have seen this type of work
before. It is Persian, no?

09:16.188 --> 09:18.534
It was my wife's.

09:21.685 --> 09:27.305
The men who died had families, wives and
children. I want them to be taken care of.

09:27.340 --> 09:30.950
They will be. You have my word.

09:30.985 --> 09:35.150
If there is any information
you can give us...

09:35.185 --> 09:39.110
anything that they told you...
Look, I'm not being funny...

09:39.145 --> 09:41.730
We've seen this death trap
in action, right?

09:41.765 --> 09:44.973
And now we're gonna take
advice from a blind man?

09:46.645 --> 09:49.530
When a man loses his sight,

09:49.565 --> 09:52.796
he finds compensation
in the senses that remain.

09:58.705 --> 10:01.707
I do not intend
on joining your mission.

10:01.742 --> 10:04.670
But I might be of assistance
in planning it.

10:04.705 --> 10:08.152
But what can you possibly know
about the Sheriff's Strong Room?

10:08.187 --> 10:10.247
A great deal.

10:10.282 --> 10:12.308
I designed it.

10:31.785 --> 10:34.549
BELL CHIMES

10:42.825 --> 10:45.669
TRUMPETS BLOW

10:50.245 --> 10:51.550
Marian.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.955
Who'd have thought?

10:53.990 --> 10:56.198
Ah! Count Friedrich!

10:56.233 --> 10:58.370
Welcome to Nottingham.

10:58.405 --> 11:02.956
Tell me, are all the roads in England so
bad? I feel like I've been beaten like an egg.

11:02.991 --> 11:05.650
Your safety was my first concern.

11:05.685 --> 11:08.910
I organised the route
so as to avoid the forest.

11:08.945 --> 11:13.052
We couldn't have your fortune or your
good self falling into outlaws' hands.

11:13.087 --> 11:18.506
Myself and my men are a match
for any rustic ruffian, I assure you

11:19.445 --> 11:20.912
Ahh.

11:27.345 --> 11:32.794
Had I known what awaited me here,
I would have employed winged horses.

11:34.265 --> 11:38.070
Lady Marian has made it
her personal responsibility

11:38.105 --> 11:41.814
to make sure your stay is as
comfortable as possible. Really?

11:41.849 --> 11:45.946
I'm very happy to make
your acquaintance. Come, come,

11:45.981 --> 11:50.791
acquaintances are for
old ladies and priests.

11:50.826 --> 11:52.992
We will dispense
with such formalities.

11:53.027 --> 11:55.538
I am already your friend,

11:55.573 --> 11:58.050
and always your servant.

12:00.665 --> 12:02.970
Do be careful there!

12:03.005 --> 12:05.075
Take the chest to my rooms.

12:08.045 --> 12:12.209
It's a few shillings
for the gaming tables.

12:12.244 --> 12:15.110
Tell me, do you play, Lady Marian?

12:15.145 --> 12:18.417
Such pursuits
are not entirely to my tastes.

12:18.452 --> 12:21.690
Then we must find pursuits
that excite you more!

12:21.725 --> 12:23.676
Tell me, do you ride?

12:29.425 --> 12:31.552
Come on, come on.

12:41.045 --> 12:43.388
Leaving so soon?

12:47.245 --> 12:48.650
I got your message.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.755
What have you got for me?

12:53.925 --> 13:00.012
Robin wants to have another go at
your Strong Room. Obviously. And?

13:00.047 --> 13:04.610
That's it.
It'll be the next few days,

13:04.645 --> 13:07.850
so you'd better be ready.
Don't waste my time.

13:07.885 --> 13:13.369
I don't pay for obvious. You'll have
to do better than that. Like what?

13:13.404 --> 13:16.835
Who told Robin Hood
about the Strong Room?

13:21.245 --> 13:22.530
I don't know.

13:22.565 --> 13:28.367
I don't. Honest.
It's early days in our relationship.

13:28.402 --> 13:30.804
But come to me again with nothing,

13:30.839 --> 13:33.206
and I will be very disappointed.

13:33.241 --> 13:36.834
Understand? Yeah. Got it.

13:39.205 --> 13:41.127
Don't make me wait too long.

13:50.725 --> 13:53.011
The designs were not meant
for the Sheriff.

13:53.046 --> 13:54.909
They were a commission.

13:54.944 --> 13:57.094
By whom? A Persian general.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.210
I did not complete the work,

13:59.245 --> 14:04.535
but I kept the plans with me always. Then, not
long ago, my apprentice sold them to the Sheriff.

14:04.570 --> 14:08.245
His family was starving,
I can't blame him.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.930
He died for it.

14:10.965 --> 14:13.934
No expense has been
spared for your gambling pleasure.

14:13.969 --> 14:17.850
Food, drink, company.

14:17.885 --> 14:21.548
We aim to please in every respect,
isn't that right, Marian?

14:21.583 --> 14:24.330
Is this your idea of sport?

14:24.365 --> 14:26.413
You do not like the skittles,
my lady?

14:26.448 --> 14:29.029
But it is a charming game.

14:29.064 --> 14:31.570
A child's game, surely?

14:31.605 --> 14:34.893
Do men really waste their money
playing this?

14:34.928 --> 14:36.890
No waste if the prize
is worth having.

14:36.925 --> 14:41.612
Come, let me show you.
Gently caress the ball...

14:41.647 --> 14:44.005
Danke schon. Thank you.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.290
Agh!

14:47.325 --> 14:50.328
Forgive me, Count Friedrich,
my aim was a little wide.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.130
This is the door,

14:55.165 --> 14:58.807
the only entrance or exit.
There's no windows. The room itself

14:58.842 --> 15:02.449
is 20 feet long by 20 feet wide.
Both walls are honeycombed

15:02.484 --> 15:05.390
with blow holes,
each loaded with arrows,

15:05.425 --> 15:09.088
primed to strike a specific spot.
You step on the wrong stone and...

15:11.585 --> 15:14.770
Which stones? My great innovation.

15:15.705 --> 15:17.366
It changes.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.253
Well, that's not possible. Is it?

15:23.925 --> 15:27.349
A weighted wheel beneath the floor
rotates regularly.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.630
Each turn defines a new route,

15:29.665 --> 15:33.294
changing the order
of the sprung stones.

15:35.505 --> 15:39.555
So, any stone can trigger a trap
at any time?

15:39.590 --> 15:42.366
I did not say it would be easy.

15:43.385 --> 15:47.287
This, I do not like.

15:49.265 --> 15:52.712
Come, Lady Marian,
bring me some luck.

15:52.747 --> 15:54.870
Where've you been? An errand.

15:54.905 --> 15:57.794
He's quite taken with her.
Encourage him.

15:57.829 --> 15:59.275
He'll lose quicker.

16:03.905 --> 16:07.671
Marian just needs a little coaxing.
It's her way.

16:07.706 --> 16:11.510
She says no when she means yes.
Really?

16:11.545 --> 16:14.235
Then I shall relish the challenge.

16:16.545 --> 16:20.886
Lady Marian, I cannot roll
unless you help me.

16:20.921 --> 16:25.228
No, thank you.
No, no, Lady Marian, I insist.

16:42.065 --> 16:45.590
Lady Marian wins! You see?! I win!

16:45.625 --> 16:48.708
Perhaps you will excuse me.
I have a headache.

16:48.743 --> 16:50.590
Oh, how terrible for you.

16:50.625 --> 16:56.268
If I may, I find that gentle rubbing
of the temples is most effective.

16:56.303 --> 17:00.065
You are very kind,
but I think I will go and lie down.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.882
As hard as it is,
we must let you go.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.665
Thank you
for your understanding, Count.

17:13.105 --> 17:19.305
Quite the beauty. I must confess, when I first
came to this country, I thought I would not like it.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.869
But now,

17:20.905 --> 17:22.906
I like it very much!

17:30.785 --> 17:33.990
You'll be up against time.
Opening the door

17:34.025 --> 17:37.190
turns an hourglass
set beside the base of the plinth.

17:37.225 --> 17:41.935
When the sand runs through,
a final fail-safe is triggered.

17:41.970 --> 17:44.750
I shouldn't ask, but what, exactly?

17:44.785 --> 17:48.835
There is a vault behind the back
wall, containing a vat of molten lead.

17:48.870 --> 17:51.828
It is kept at a constant heat
by the fires of the kitchen.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.310
When the hourglass is empty,

17:54.345 --> 17:59.590
the vat is turned. The liquid
flows into a series of gutters.

17:59.625 --> 18:02.410
The pipes in the walls.
Burning liquid sprays out,

18:02.445 --> 18:06.347
covering the entire room. Anyone
inside would not stand a chance.

18:06.382 --> 18:08.870
And yet...

18:08.905 --> 18:12.432
the coins remain intact, because
they're harder than the soft lead!

18:15.625 --> 18:18.492
All I'm hearing is arrows,
lead and certain death.

18:18.527 --> 18:20.390
Encouraging!

18:20.425 --> 18:23.269
How long before the hourglass
runs through?

18:23.304 --> 18:25.210
A slow count of eight score and ten.

18:25.245 --> 18:30.194
In a count of 170, you've got to
get to the money and get it out?

18:30.229 --> 18:32.850
Nice of you to join us, Allan.

18:32.885 --> 18:35.079
Well, I still think you're mad.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.230
But if you want some more help...

18:37.265 --> 18:41.330
We are mad! We should stick to
robbing merchants in the forest!

18:41.365 --> 18:45.825
That, we are good at. Then we will
work until we get better at this!

18:47.045 --> 18:50.788
We'll meet near the old barn,
near Clun. What for?

18:50.823 --> 18:52.390
To practise.

18:52.425 --> 18:55.747
We are going to build
this Strong Room over there.

18:57.445 --> 18:58.969
Good!

19:01.565 --> 19:05.130
Oh... Excuse me, can I pass? Orders.

19:05.165 --> 19:08.669
No-one passes, not even you.
Sheriff's private room.

19:08.704 --> 19:12.130
Lady Marian? Oh, no! Let me pass,
just this once.

19:12.165 --> 19:18.172
Please. What's in it for me? Nice gown,
very fetching. A bit of a new look for you.

19:18.207 --> 19:20.770
How dare you?!
I'm just being friendly.

19:22.305 --> 19:24.485
How about a little kiss?

19:24.520 --> 19:26.666
How about a little smack?!

19:28.465 --> 19:31.070
Excuse me!

19:32.465 --> 19:35.810
You are an impressive fighter.
Yes, I know.

19:35.845 --> 19:39.427
And you are also very impressive
in many ways. Please.

19:39.462 --> 19:43.009
Are you not glad I came after you?
I made no invitation.

19:43.044 --> 19:45.490
You feign a headache and retire.

19:45.525 --> 19:49.211
I follow. This is the way that
trysts are made all over the world.

19:49.246 --> 19:52.254
Well, this one is all over,
all right?

19:52.289 --> 19:53.590
As of now.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.992
Gisborne?! I mustn't be found here.

20:01.985 --> 20:03.475
Come, quick!

20:06.565 --> 20:10.130
There should be a guard
on that door at all times.

20:10.165 --> 20:13.851
I'll look into it immediately,
my Lord. Wait. First things, first.

20:13.886 --> 20:15.506
Tomorrow's meeting. Come here.

20:21.085 --> 20:24.634
The division
of the money in my Strong Room.

20:28.685 --> 20:32.570
You will be in charge of making sure
our friends,

20:32.605 --> 20:37.087
the Black Knights, get their share. You
wish to strengthen our forces in the south?

20:37.122 --> 20:39.986
The share is generous.
Strategy, Gisborne.

20:41.645 --> 20:44.466
The King is most likely
to land there on his return.

20:46.365 --> 20:48.930
Besides...

20:48.965 --> 20:54.369
there will be plenty of funds in the war
chest, after our German booby loses tonight.

20:54.404 --> 20:56.890
We'll make sure he loses big.

20:56.925 --> 20:59.894
What if the count
surprises us and wins? Wins?

20:59.929 --> 21:02.170
That buffoon?

21:02.205 --> 21:05.890
"Oh, I feel like I've been
beaten as an egg."

21:05.925 --> 21:09.292
Mincey oaf. But you have made
provision just in case?

21:09.327 --> 21:12.573
You know me too well, Gisborne.

21:12.608 --> 21:14.170
Of course.

21:14.205 --> 21:18.970
All eventualities
have been considered.

21:19.005 --> 21:23.328
Dice that only roll one way -
in our favour.

21:23.363 --> 21:26.271
Make sure Marian is with us tonight.

21:38.265 --> 21:41.070
What does he think?

21:41.105 --> 21:46.873
That I will not be suspicious of an
invitation from a sheriff in... where are we?!

21:46.908 --> 21:49.710
That I will not do my homework
and find out who he is?

21:49.745 --> 21:54.226
Does he think that his reputation has not
spread to Europe? And you are in on this plan.

21:54.261 --> 21:58.708
This is not the first time I have been
offered a girl to take my eyes from the table!

21:58.743 --> 22:00.430
Let go of me!

22:00.465 --> 22:04.849
Do you people think that I am
a complete idiot? Yes, until now,

22:04.884 --> 22:09.233
which is exactly what you wanted.
What do you mean? Oh, come on.

22:09.268 --> 22:10.750
The way you fight.

22:10.785 --> 22:15.469
You're no booby. I don't think
a booby does homework on his hosts.

22:15.504 --> 22:20.153
It suits you to have people think
you're an idiot. It helps sometimes.

22:20.188 --> 22:23.125
People play less cautiously,
but I am no cheat.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.593
And I am no lackey of the Sheriff.

22:27.105 --> 22:29.471
So, we are both players.

22:31.065 --> 22:32.470
And what will you do?

22:32.505 --> 22:35.170
Do? Leave. If the Sheriff
is loading the dice,

22:35.205 --> 22:39.232
I cannot win. I will be struck
by a sudden illness.

22:40.785 --> 22:43.731
Don't leave. Help me.

22:43.766 --> 22:45.650
Help you?

22:45.685 --> 22:47.630
You heard the Sheriff.

22:47.665 --> 22:51.530
He's using the money to plot against
the King. I have friends

22:51.565 --> 22:55.387
who would like to relieve him of
his money before he distributes it.

22:55.422 --> 22:59.185
And that will have to be tonight.
This is a dangerous game.

23:00.725 --> 23:02.465
But you're a player.

23:06.725 --> 23:10.696
The hourglass turns now! One...

23:10.731 --> 23:14.668
Arrow!...Two, three, four, five...

23:15.245 --> 23:17.531
John, no!...six, seven...
I am stone!

23:17.566 --> 23:19.410
Not there John, no.
Well, where?

23:19.445 --> 23:22.334
There! Hang on, stone?
I thought he was pit?

23:22.369 --> 23:25.146
No, I'm pit! Stop! Please! Shut up!

23:27.805 --> 23:31.050
Lives depend on this.

23:31.085 --> 23:33.570
The wives and families of the dead.

23:33.605 --> 23:35.905
Not to mention
what will happen to England

23:35.940 --> 23:38.206
if the Sheriff
starts to give out that money.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.610
If we are going to defeat
the Strong Room,

23:41.645 --> 23:47.265
then we have to work as a team,
and that means discipline.

23:48.725 --> 23:50.750
What do you think you're doing?

23:51.645 --> 23:55.172
You stay in the castle.
Believe me, I would rather stay here.

23:55.207 --> 23:57.909
I am merely doing as I am instructed.

23:57.944 --> 24:00.612
The lady Marian
is to ride out with me.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.610
No, no, no, no.

24:02.645 --> 24:05.610
Well, if I do not ride,
I might be out of sorts,

24:05.645 --> 24:09.570
and if I'm out of sorts, I might decide
not to play the tables at all tonight.

24:11.305 --> 24:13.970
Very well.

24:14.005 --> 24:16.326
I will provide you with an escort.
Guards!

24:16.361 --> 24:18.490
The forest
is a very dangerous place.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.850
Sheriff, we are both
men of the world, ja?

24:20.885 --> 24:25.072
Perhaps alone with nature, out in the
forest amongst the trees and flowers,

24:25.107 --> 24:27.875
Lady Marian
might not play so hard to get. Hmm?

24:27.910 --> 24:29.332
No guards.

24:32.445 --> 24:33.935
Don't be late back.

24:44.125 --> 24:46.935
There is a way, you know.

24:46.970 --> 24:49.410
A way to what?

24:49.445 --> 24:53.074
There is a way to do all the things
you need to do and still find love.

24:55.645 --> 24:57.693
You're a troubled soul.

24:57.728 --> 24:59.450
Be patient.

24:59.485 --> 25:01.294
You will prevail.

25:03.265 --> 25:07.531
And you can tell all that
by just feeling my face? No.

25:07.566 --> 25:10.073
Your friend Much
was telling me earlier.

25:13.525 --> 25:16.070
Now I'm better acquainted
with your Sheriff,

25:16.105 --> 25:19.734
I understand why you have
such admiration for this outlaw.

25:19.769 --> 25:23.270
It's not just me.
I didn't mean just you.

25:23.305 --> 25:28.732
I think I would like to take to the woods
and fight injustice like your Robin Hood.

25:28.767 --> 25:30.350
What do you think?

25:30.385 --> 25:34.731
Why does a potential freedom fighter
waste his life gambling?

25:36.105 --> 25:39.609
I am a count. My life has been
managed since the day that I was born.

25:39.644 --> 25:43.450
Tradition, etiquette...

25:43.485 --> 25:47.888
It's all so safe. I crave danger.
You wouldn't understand.

25:47.923 --> 25:50.171
Don't be so sure.

26:01.025 --> 26:04.028
Are you sure you know
how to find these friends of yours?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.050
I'm hoping they're gonna find us.

26:07.125 --> 26:09.525
They already have!

26:17.785 --> 26:22.085
Who's your new friend? Count Friedrich
Berthold Otto von Wittelsbach,

26:22.120 --> 26:24.087
from the German Duchy of Bavaria.

26:24.122 --> 26:26.974
And your friend.

26:28.765 --> 26:34.635
This is the Sheriff's guest? Yes. And you
trust him enough to bring him here to meet me?

26:34.670 --> 26:40.029
He wants to help us. Oh It seems
we have a common desire, Robin Hood.

26:41.545 --> 26:44.776
I mean, we both wish to see
the Sheriff broken and humiliated.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.632
Marian and I were discussing...
First name terms!

26:47.667 --> 26:49.207
Jealous?

26:49.242 --> 26:50.710
Of him?

26:50.745 --> 26:53.270
Marian has a proposition for you.

26:53.305 --> 26:56.286
If you want to rob the Strong Room,
it has to be tonight.

26:56.321 --> 26:59.230
Not possible. We're not ready.
Well, then don't bother.

26:59.265 --> 27:03.770
The Sheriff will divide the money between
the Black Knights, who are coming tomorrow.

27:03.805 --> 27:07.155
After that the Strong Room
will be empty.

27:08.305 --> 27:10.070
I don't like that look.

27:10.105 --> 27:13.550
That look means trouble.
Robin, it's certain death.

27:13.585 --> 27:18.352
Well, if that money is going to be used to
finance weapons and men to kill the King,

27:18.387 --> 27:21.075
then we are dead already.

27:34.765 --> 27:36.450
Kiss me. What?

27:36.485 --> 27:40.148
Otherwise what will they think
we've been doing all this time?

27:43.025 --> 27:44.470
Ahh...

27:44.505 --> 27:48.032
We have a budding romance after all.
So it would seem.

27:49.125 --> 27:53.073
Maybe one more, to make it
really convincing? Careful.

27:53.108 --> 27:56.290
Remember the skittles? Ah, ja.

27:56.325 --> 27:59.192
He's succeeded where you failed,
Gisborne.

27:59.227 --> 28:01.089
So, come on...

28:01.124 --> 28:02.952
money to be made.

28:16.045 --> 28:17.751
You. Stop.

28:24.045 --> 28:27.993
I want the count's goblet filled
at all times tonight. You understand?

28:29.105 --> 28:30.595
Go on.

28:33.405 --> 28:34.906
Put it here.

28:39.565 --> 28:42.090
You know what to do.

28:42.125 --> 28:45.890
There. The money you lose tonight
goes into that.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.691
It connects directly to the Strong
Room below. Once it's in there...

28:49.726 --> 28:53.305
Ja, ja, I know. Our outlaw friends
will steal it back for me.

28:53.340 --> 28:56.850
It seems unfair. No gambler
likes to lose, even on purpose.

28:56.885 --> 29:01.288
Well, if you win, the Sheriff will
never let you leave Nottingham alive.

29:01.323 --> 29:05.289
I was running towards the Great Hall
and I tripped and I fell,

29:05.324 --> 29:08.869
and I think I've hurt my ankle!
Look!

29:12.365 --> 29:14.850
Men are so obvious.

29:14.885 --> 29:17.930
Now, play as long as you can. Ja.

29:17.965 --> 29:24.154
Take your time, and then,
when we get the signal, start losing.

29:39.365 --> 29:40.889
Oh, I didn't recognise you!

29:50.525 --> 29:53.369
What? Nothing.

29:56.845 --> 30:00.190
You wanna dress like a girl
more often. Oh, I do, do I?

30:00.225 --> 30:02.335
It's just a thought.

30:06.845 --> 30:08.290
Count Friedrich.

30:08.325 --> 30:10.930
Ah! Fortune awaits, good luck!

30:12.805 --> 30:18.450
Lady Marian is my good luck charm
this evening. You know, Gisborne,

30:18.485 --> 30:22.672
I have a new-found respect for Marian.
Are we to endure this ritual at every turn?

30:22.707 --> 30:25.250
Let him lose in his own way.

30:25.285 --> 30:29.107
And if he doesn't,
we'll switch the dice!

30:29.142 --> 30:31.197
Oh!

30:31.232 --> 30:32.909
I won!

30:32.944 --> 30:34.587
Throw.

30:36.285 --> 30:37.934
Count Friedrich wins!

30:41.885 --> 30:44.012
The count wins!

30:46.405 --> 30:48.635
The count wins!

30:56.325 --> 30:58.213
Again! I win!

31:04.445 --> 31:06.686
No dogs this time.

31:15.805 --> 31:17.215
Where's the arrow?

31:17.250 --> 31:19.552
I don't know.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.855
Go on, Will.

31:39.185 --> 31:40.490
Poison.

31:40.525 --> 31:42.891
That wasn't there before.

31:44.425 --> 31:46.310
They've changed the sequence.

31:46.345 --> 31:50.050
Well, then we can't go on!
Tonight is our only chance.

31:50.085 --> 31:54.205
It the sequence has changed, our
practising is for nothing! If we do not try,

31:54.240 --> 31:58.325
England will be lost! Yes, and if
we're dead, then that's MY England lost!

32:04.245 --> 32:06.406
We go.

32:11.085 --> 32:12.655
All right.

32:14.805 --> 32:16.989
But if we die,
don't come running to me.

32:17.024 --> 32:18.566
Go on, Will.

32:19.925 --> 32:21.210
John?

32:31.685 --> 32:33.926
Ready?

32:36.845 --> 32:39.106
Djaq? Tell Marian we're in.

32:39.141 --> 32:41.368
Allan, John, keep watch.

32:44.085 --> 32:45.575
Much?

32:51.965 --> 32:57.608
Do not take your eyes off
that hourglass. Bow.

33:03.585 --> 33:05.210
They're in.

33:05.245 --> 33:06.815
Better start losing.

33:09.225 --> 33:10.790
If that's the way he loses,

33:10.825 --> 33:14.249
you may have to use your contingency
plan sooner than expected.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.952
We're about even. It's early yet.

33:32.425 --> 33:33.995
Don't think about that.

33:34.030 --> 33:35.452
Marian.

33:35.865 --> 33:39.449
We have to start losing. I am doing
my best. Time is running out.

33:40.705 --> 33:42.445
Oh, brilliant.

33:46.865 --> 33:48.446
Go on!

33:56.825 --> 33:57.985
Watch out!

34:03.065 --> 34:05.910
Sheriff,
let us make things interesting.

34:05.945 --> 34:11.554
Everything I have, against the
entire contents of your Strong Room.

34:13.945 --> 34:15.590
As we say in Bavaria,

34:15.625 --> 34:20.527
"Das letzte Hemd hat keine Taschen."

34:23.465 --> 34:26.389
"You cannot take it with you."

34:28.245 --> 34:31.089
Sheriff, what do you say?
It's only money.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.355
I agree.

34:58.985 --> 35:03.388
It's such a momentous game.
Might I suggest...

35:04.545 --> 35:06.945
...a change of dice?

35:06.980 --> 35:09.015
As you wish.

35:15.945 --> 35:17.985
Ja.

35:18.020 --> 35:20.025
I see.

35:21.625 --> 35:23.449
Uh-huh.

35:23.484 --> 35:25.273
Ja...

35:26.465 --> 35:28.530
You see?

35:28.565 --> 35:30.430
It's easy once you know how.

35:35.845 --> 35:38.473
Excellent!

35:41.685 --> 35:43.949
For luck.

35:50.165 --> 35:52.713
The house wins!
Ohhh!

35:57.125 --> 35:58.750
Hang on...

35:58.785 --> 36:01.629
what's this? Master,
please get out, there's no time!

36:01.664 --> 36:03.195
Oh, Sheriff.

36:04.725 --> 36:06.315
It's another trick.

36:06.350 --> 36:07.906
It's an illusion.

36:10.245 --> 36:13.066
An image
thrown onto a sheet of glass.

36:18.925 --> 36:20.950
The money is not here.

36:22.225 --> 36:24.610
Lady Marian,

36:24.645 --> 36:27.305
you have brought me
nothing but bad luck.

36:27.340 --> 36:29.966
Your attentions
are no longer welcome.

36:30.001 --> 36:32.388
Auf Weidersehen!

36:37.485 --> 36:39.330
Well done, Marian.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.936
It wasn't so hard, was it?

36:41.971 --> 36:44.405
No, it wasn't.

36:47.325 --> 36:50.852
Excellent. The war chest
has doubled in one night.

36:53.145 --> 36:55.375
Master, get out of there.

36:55.410 --> 36:57.265
COINS DROPPING

37:16.285 --> 37:19.129
What are you doing? Just leave it!
We've come this far!

37:23.125 --> 37:26.094
Come on. What's he doing?! Wait!

37:30.205 --> 37:32.935
The money is here.
The bags, quickly!

37:38.645 --> 37:40.749
Come on, Much. Give it...

37:40.784 --> 37:42.853
All right, all right!

37:53.405 --> 37:57.296
Marian. My men have the coach ready,
your friends?

37:57.331 --> 37:59.731
If they have succeeded,
we will know soon.

37:59.766 --> 38:01.374
And if they haven't?

38:08.585 --> 38:10.052
The hourglass!

38:12.605 --> 38:15.187
Why do we leave everything...

38:15.222 --> 38:18.495
to the last... second?!

38:18.530 --> 38:20.690
Well...

38:20.725 --> 38:22.295
I find it's more fun that way.

38:23.145 --> 38:25.375
BELL CHIMES

38:26.845 --> 38:28.670
No...

38:28.705 --> 38:30.332
Come on, go!

38:39.345 --> 38:41.495
The Strong Room...

38:41.530 --> 38:43.210
Guards!

38:43.245 --> 38:45.250
Help! You men, quickly!

38:45.285 --> 38:46.775
The Sheriff is under attack!

39:15.405 --> 39:17.970
Look at YOU!

39:18.005 --> 39:20.735
Be careful. If I can see
the friendship between you,

39:20.770 --> 39:23.170
so may others.
Don't worry, I crave the danger.

39:23.205 --> 39:29.371
If you're ever in Bavaria, I remain, my lady,
your servant, your booby and your friend.

39:30.585 --> 39:32.830
You're funny.

39:32.865 --> 39:35.254
You are beautiful. You're leaving.

39:49.565 --> 39:51.806
My war chest,
and the booby's money...

39:53.545 --> 39:56.571
But they can't have done! No! No!

39:58.125 --> 40:00.889
No! No!

40:01.665 --> 40:03.769
No! No!

40:04.065 --> 40:06.169
Nooo!

40:17.025 --> 40:22.065
Count Friedrich will take you as far as the coast.
I can't thank you enough for your help, Stephen.

40:22.100 --> 40:25.671
Yes, you can.
The families of the men that died.

40:25.706 --> 40:28.133
We'll look after them.

40:29.885 --> 40:31.455
You will prevail.

40:37.345 --> 40:39.868
Now, you're sure about your route?

40:39.903 --> 40:42.350
You stick to the smaller roads.

40:42.385 --> 40:47.152
The Sheriff will have the main ones
covered. Another bumpy ride. This country...

40:47.187 --> 40:50.012
By the time I get home,
I will be perfectly scrambled.

40:50.905 --> 40:54.955
This is your money. Thank you.
England is forever in your debt.

40:54.990 --> 40:57.596
Take it. Keep it.

40:57.631 --> 40:59.550
What?

40:59.585 --> 41:03.271
England's debt is to Lady Marian.
Not me.

41:03.306 --> 41:05.995
Spend it wisely, Robin Hood.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.510
About Marian...

41:07.545 --> 41:12.107
One gamble I would have given anything
to win. You are a lucky man, Robin Hood.

41:18.145 --> 41:20.329
Farewell.

41:26.165 --> 41:28.077
Right...

41:28.112 --> 41:29.989
Work to do.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.889
I'm not being funny...

41:36.924 --> 41:39.360
the poor have it easy.

41:39.395 --> 41:41.796
I don't think so, Allan.

41:44.665 --> 41:47.150
This is what we do, lads.

41:47.185 --> 41:49.551
We've turned war chest
into poor chest.

41:51.105 --> 41:54.632
Well, come on. We have four
more villages before sun down.

41:58.365 --> 42:00.510
I've been thinking.

42:00.545 --> 42:03.079
We've never been to Germany.

42:03.114 --> 42:05.570
If things don't work out here,

42:05.605 --> 42:08.028
maybe the count would
have us over there. Hmm.

42:08.063 --> 42:11.631
Much, Count of Schleswig-Holstein!

42:11.666 --> 42:12.930
What's so funny?

42:12.965 --> 42:17.030
I could be Count of Schleshy...
whatever.

42:17.065 --> 42:19.830
It's hard to be count of a place
you can't pronounce!

42:19.865 --> 42:23.505
Not necessarily. Nah. Sovereign
of Sherwood, mate. That's you.

42:23.540 --> 42:27.305
Well, that's us, lads.
Sovereigns of Sherwood.

42:29.465 --> 42:32.730
It's Gisborne.
Now! He's creating a new armour.

42:32.765 --> 42:35.512
We need to take his toys away.
Get them!

42:35.547 --> 42:37.230
I want 5, 000 suits of armour.

42:37.265 --> 42:42.089
I'm afraid I can't let you keep these diamonds,
Gisborne. And I can't let you take them.

42:42.124 --> 42:44.906
When there are people
who know our little secret,

42:44.941 --> 42:47.250
those people have to die.

42:47.285 --> 42:50.493
I need your permission to leave
the castle. Hit him!

42:50.528 --> 42:53.067
A man wearing this
would be invincible.
