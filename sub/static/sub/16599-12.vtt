Uncle Chin.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.612
I'm gonna miss you, too.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.380
She was kidnapped, Steve!

00:15.415 --> 00:16.415

00:16.450 --> 00:17.416

00:18.685 --> 00:19.351
GROVER:
<i>This whole thing</i>

00:19.386 --> 00:21.119
is nothing but a revenge play.

00:21.154 --> 00:21.820
Wait, wait, wait.
You guys had dealings

00:21.855 --> 00:22.821
with the Diegos?
- Yes.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.189
<i>We caught a case</i>

00:24.224 --> 00:25.123

STEVE: Okay, this is
blood for blood.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.133
And I'm not gonna put this
on anyone else. This is on me.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.302

They're gonna take you

00:51.852 --> 00:53.718
He's alive.

00:53.753 --> 00:56.455
He's alive,
and we're gonna find him.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.191
This is Mexico.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.525
I know.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.261
The cartels kill
whoever they want.

01:03.296 --> 01:05.197
Some cop from Hawaii
means nothing down here.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.467
I'm not gonna argue that, Kono;
you're right.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.837
Now let me tell you something
about your cousin.

01:11.872 --> 01:15.574
He's strong, he's resourceful,

01:15.609 --> 01:17.809
and he's holding on.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.845
He's holding on
because he knows

01:19.880 --> 01:22.214
we're gonna come
and get him.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.183
And we're gonna get him.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.352
And we're gonna bring him back.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.288
Huh?

01:30.323 --> 01:32.257
Take the door.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.432
(exhales)
- Adam.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.167
Adam.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.670
I couldn't just sit by
and do nothing.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.880
(sighs) How did
you find us?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.848
It wasn't easy.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.184
You know, I'm pretty sure
you're violating your parole.

01:59.219 --> 02:02.454
Yeah, well, all I'm worried
about right now is Chin.

02:02.489 --> 02:03.788
What's the latest?

02:03.823 --> 02:05.557
We grabbed somebody
from Diego's crew.

02:05.592 --> 02:06.925
McGarrett's in there
trying to get a lead

02:06.960 --> 02:08.760
on where Chin might be.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.929
Hey.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.231
You didn't have to come.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.134
But I'm glad you did.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.870
(man groaning)

02:18.905 --> 02:19.905
So what's up?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.940
That's one tough son of a bitch.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.543
Brother Adam.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.877
I'm here to do
whatever you need.

02:25.912 --> 02:26.878
Thank you, man.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.680
We need all the
help we can get.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.949
All right, so, according
to homeboy here,

02:30.984 --> 02:32.951
Diego has a compound
in the jungle.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.853
He thinks that's where
they'll take Chin, all right?

02:34.888 --> 02:36.955
But it's 30 miles north of here,
so we got to go.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.957
Oh, we ready to go. Danny's out
there loading the car right now.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.292
Load up homeboy, too.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.660
We need him for navigation.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.699
You know, it's funny.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.502
You're doing all this
for your brother's honor,

03:57.537 --> 03:59.905
when the truth is he had none.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.778
You didn't know my brother.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.980
I know he tried to sell you out.

04:09.015 --> 04:13.785
He was gonna give up Frontera,
knowing that the DEA

04:13.820 --> 04:16.755
was gonna use him to bring down
your entire organization.

04:16.790 --> 04:20.292
He betrayed you, Carlos.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.294

Okay, here's the deal.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.941
Ever since I moved out
of Chin's place,

10:09.976 --> 10:11.242
I've been sort of homeless.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.077

10:13.112 --> 10:16.280

But it's only when I can't find
a couch to crash on.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.152
Jerry, you moved out of
Chin's place months ago.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.253
Why didn't you say something?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.922
Yeah, Jerry, you don't
have to sleep in an office.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.124
No, it's cool.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.759

comfy here.

10:29.862 --> 10:31.729

down in my bunker,

10:31.764 --> 10:32.730
but there are no windows,

10:32.765 --> 10:35.033

to the natural light,

10:35.068 --> 10:37.068

my circadian rhythms.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.776
You need somewhere to live.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.044
I've been trying, but it's hard

10:46.079 --> 10:47.712
when you don't have
a credit history.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.047

Oh, no.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.330
"Oh, no," what?

11:08.234 --> 11:09.467
I did it again.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.169

11:11.204 --> 11:12.837

You, uh, you want to
tell us something, Max?

11:43.136 --> 11:45.369
Well, it appears that
Dr. Kimbo was under

11:45.404 --> 11:47.238
the mistaken impression
that you were in charge

11:47.273 --> 11:49.107
of all the hiring decisions.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.109
Quite unfortunate,

STEVE:
Strong candidate?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.282
You're not even
gonna offer us one?

You know,
some cops I know

11:59.786 --> 12:01.419

arrestable offense?

12:01.454 --> 12:04.055
Max, why are you hiring
a new coroner?

12:04.090 --> 12:05.890
Well, even with Noelani
on board,

12:05.925 --> 12:07.525
the M.E.'s office
is still short-staffed.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.827
Case in point,
I had to come in on Saturday

12:09.862 --> 12:11.295
to do an autopsy on a body.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.131
All right, well,
who is he?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.333
Mitch Lawson.
Uh, he's 39 years old.

12:15.368 --> 12:19.137
HPD found his abandoned car
along Halawa Drive.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.438
When they inspected his vehicle,

12:20.473 --> 12:22.840
they found the fuel gauge
at empty.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.109
Then they noticed blood
on the trunk's lid.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.879
Mr. Lawson's body was discovered
inside the trunk.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.881
Uh-huh.
We got a C.O.D.?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.016
C.O.D. was blunt force
trauma to the head,

12:32.051 --> 12:33.284
resulting in several

12:33.319 --> 12:35.019
depressed skull fractures.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.054
Time of death was
between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m.,

12:37.089 --> 12:39.357
which is actually
interesting because

12:39.392 --> 12:41.893
when HPD did their
preliminary investigations,

12:41.928 --> 12:44.428
according to their notes,
the victim's key card

12:44.463 --> 12:48.199
was swiped in the place of work
at 9:37 p.m.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.134
Hmm. - Okay. So somebody
kills him at work,

12:50.169 --> 12:52.270
and then uses the card to get
the body out of the building.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.238
And then they
dump the body

12:53.273 --> 12:56.107
into the victim's trunk,
and they drive off.

12:56.142 --> 12:58.376
And then, shortly thereafter,
they run out of gas.

12:58.411 --> 13:02.847
Hmm. Well, it definitely sounds
like none of this was planned.

13:02.882 --> 13:06.017
You know, it's just more
of a, uh, improvised,

13:06.052 --> 13:07.985
learn-as-you-go kind of thing.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.187
Max, where's this guy work?

13:09.222 --> 13:11.022
I'm thinking that's
our primary crime scene.

13:11.057 --> 13:14.458
He was a car salesman at
Pacific Motor Sales in Honolulu.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.093
Okay, let's call Duke,
have him take CSU

13:16.128 --> 13:18.062
down there to process,
then we'll have to

13:18.097 --> 13:19.597
question everybody there;
I'm thinking our killer

13:19.632 --> 13:20.765
probably worked
with our vic here.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.901
Yeah, you might want to pump
your brakes there, chief.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.937
You're talking about
car salesmen here.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.939
So what?

13:27.974 --> 13:31.342
They are masters
of psychological warfare.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.511
Coupled with the fact
that they're all born liars.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.079
You never bought a car before?

13:35.114 --> 13:38.249
They'll lie to you
just to make conversation.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.017
You can question them till
you're blue in the face,

13:40.052 --> 13:42.053
they're never gonna
give you a straight answer.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.087
You seem to have
quite an insight

13:43.122 --> 13:44.288
into the profession, Captain.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.424
You damn right I do,
and I'll tell you why.

13:47.593 --> 13:48.759
I spent every summer
of my teenage years

13:48.794 --> 13:52.864
washing Chevys at my uncle's
dealership back in Chicago.

13:52.899 --> 13:57.168
To this day, my Uncle Kenny's
the crookedest bird I ever met.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.236
You go ahead and march HPD

13:58.271 --> 14:00.171
and them crime lab people
in there if you want to.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.607
All you're gonna do is end up
raising the perp's antenna.

14:02.642 --> 14:06.377
Okay, so, uh,
what do you have in mind?

14:06.412 --> 14:09.247
Well, if there's one thing

14:09.282 --> 14:11.115
my Uncle Kenny's
crooked ass taught me,

14:11.150 --> 14:12.650
it's that you never cede
an advantage.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.086
And right now, we're sitting on
a pretty significant one.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.421
Are we? What's that?

14:17.456 --> 14:19.557
Element of surprise.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.561
♪ ♪

14:29.435 --> 14:31.669
Do you believe this?
Mitch's body's still warm,

14:31.704 --> 14:35.039
and they're already bringing in
someone to replace him.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.543
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a warm welcome

14:39.578 --> 14:40.410
to the newest member

14:40.446 --> 14:44.515
of the Pacific Auto team,
Mr. Roy Watts.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.050
Yeah!

14:46.085 --> 14:47.385
Morning, ladies
and gentlemen.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.153
All right,

14:49.188 --> 14:50.621
who's ready
to move some metal, huh?

14:50.656 --> 14:51.656
Huh? Come on!

15:04.603 --> 15:06.237
Well, that was a
short-lived vacation.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.672
Yeah, right?
Danny had it right.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.341
He got out of town with Melissa
before the call came in.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.410
Huh. Hey, how's Sara?

15:12.445 --> 15:13.544
Still adjusting.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.613
Actually, she didn't want me
to go to work this morning,

15:15.648 --> 15:17.315
but Abby offered to
take her to the beach,

15:17.350 --> 15:18.382
and that cheered her up.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.184
Oh. Kids are
so resilient.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.420
And with time, she'll put what
happened behind her and move on.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.354
I hope.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.057
Hey. Thanks for coming in.
Let's get to work.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.728
And if you're not on the floor,

15:30.763 --> 15:33.030
I expect you to be
on the phones,

15:33.065 --> 15:34.665
working those lead sheets.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.401
So get out there
and close, close, close.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.737
Because it's what Mitch
would have wanted.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.973
And if that's not
incentive enough,

15:42.008 --> 15:44.075
remember that
the end-of-the-year bonus

15:44.110 --> 15:46.277
is still up for grabs.

15:46.312 --> 15:49.113
(quietly): This looks like
a two-horse race to me.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.183
Yeah, with only
one horse left running.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.418
Only person with a shot
at beating Mitch's numbers,

15:54.453 --> 15:55.720
Paul Burnett.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.355
Mitch and Paul are
the heavy hitters here.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.189
Hmm.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.624
Schlubs like me,
best we can hope for

16:00.659 --> 16:03.594
is making our numbers so
we don't get fired this month.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.629
(sighs)
Wasn't always that way, though.

16:05.664 --> 16:08.065
I was Salesman of the Year,
'07 to '09.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.134
Hey, listen, how much
is that bonus, anyway?

16:10.169 --> 16:11.703
50K.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.405
SALES MANAGER:
Let's get out there

16:14.440 --> 16:15.740
and put your best foot
forward...

16:17.576 --> 16:18.509
Lou.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.211
GROVER: According to
some of the guys here,

16:20.246 --> 16:21.479
Paul Burnett and our vic

16:21.514 --> 16:23.414
were constantly butting heads.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.282
Two alpha males
in the same office

16:25.317 --> 16:27.385
vying for the same sales,
you know.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.654
Anyway, they would always
undercut each other's deals.

16:30.689 --> 16:33.190
They even ran around
bad-mouthing each other

16:33.225 --> 16:34.625
all over town.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.494
Okay, and now with Mitch
out of the picture,

16:36.529 --> 16:38.763
Paul's a shoo-in
for that bonus, right?

16:38.798 --> 16:41.098
That's right, all $50,000 of it.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.500
KONO:
And, boy, does he need it.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.568
Paul Burnett made some
pretty poor business decisions.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.103
He invested everything he had

16:46.138 --> 16:47.638
into a nightclub
that's hemorrhaging cash,

16:47.673 --> 16:49.473
and now he's about to go broke.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.409
All right, so he had motive
and he had opportunity.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.778
Plus, we also know
he was there late last night.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.646
GROVER:
Oh, it gets better than that.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.381
I spoke to the receptionist,
who said

16:57.416 --> 16:59.517
Burnett was the first one
in the office today,

16:59.552 --> 17:01.419
and outside of a sales meeting,

17:01.454 --> 17:03.587
he's been<i> in</i> his office,
holed up

17:03.622 --> 17:06.057
with the blinds drawn
and the door locked.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.525
Well, it sounds like that
could be our crime scene.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.627
Hey, Lou, any chance
you can get into that office,

17:09.662 --> 17:11.095
take a look around?

17:12.331 --> 17:16.267
Yeah. Yeah, I think
I got an idea about that.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.735
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:21.105
What is it? I'm busy.

17:21.140 --> 17:24.442
Pardon the interruption,
but I got a customer here.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.711
He's interested
in a test drive.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.149
Really? It looks like the only
thing he's interested in

17:32.184 --> 17:33.551
is the free Danish tray.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.252
You know, it's funny
you should mention food.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.620
He does have a passion for it.

17:36.655 --> 17:37.554
The man is looking to expand

17:37.590 --> 17:40.691
his shrimp truck business,
and he told me

17:40.726 --> 17:45.096
he's gonna be needing about
four or five new trucks.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.469
And you're just, uh,

17:51.504 --> 17:53.104
handing me this
amazing opportunity

17:53.139 --> 17:54.505
out of the goodness
of your heart?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.607
Oh, hell no.
- (chuckles)

17:56.642 --> 17:58.309
I'm doing it
because when it comes

17:58.344 --> 17:59.877
to fleet sales
around this place,

17:59.912 --> 18:01.879
I hear that you are the man.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.181
That and the fact
that you're gonna give me

18:04.216 --> 18:06.183
50% of the commission.
(chuckles): Ha.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.652
(clears throat) Finder's
fee is more like 20%.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.721
Then I'll take 40.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.656
I like you.
I like you.

18:12.691 --> 18:16.760
Which is why I am
willing to kick you 30.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.662
My man.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.531
35 it is.

18:24.236 --> 18:27.338
Well played. (clears throat)
- Thank you.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.706
Jackass.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.708
BURNETT:
Hello, sir. How you doing?

18:30.743 --> 18:31.542
Paul Burnett.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.377
I'm in charge of
all the fleet sales

18:33.412 --> 18:34.611
here at Pacific Motor Sales.

18:34.647 --> 18:38.449
I hear you want to test drive
one of our fantastic trucks.

18:38.484 --> 18:39.817
Yeah, what's up, Lou?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.620
GROVER: What's up is
I just found a smoking gun.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.455
Interesting choice of words,
considering our victim

18:44.490 --> 18:46.223
had his head bashed in,
but go on.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.359
It's a figure of speech.
Just listen.

18:48.394 --> 18:51.896
I've got Mitch Lawson's
lead sheets here, okay?

18:51.931 --> 18:54.532
I found them in the top drawer
of Paul Burnett's desk.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.799
He stole them.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.568
And apparently he's been
spending all morning

18:57.603 --> 19:00.638
trying to poach Mitch's
potential customers.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.440
You're telling me this guy Paul,
he kills Mitch,

19:03.475 --> 19:05.943
then he steals and uses
Mitch's lead sheets

19:05.978 --> 19:08.579
to get ahead
so he can get the bonus?

19:08.614 --> 19:11.549
Okay, I got to meet him.
We're bringing him in.

19:12.585 --> 19:15.553
This thing got
seat warmers?

19:15.588 --> 19:18.389
We don't order any
with that feature.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.792
It's hardly necessary
in a warm climate like Hawaii.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.395
Until you're on
a long haul

19:24.430 --> 19:26.530
and your butt
falls asleep.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.867
You got to keep that
posterior stimulated.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.669
(chuckles)

19:31.704 --> 19:32.670
(clears throat)

19:32.705 --> 19:34.272
(phone chimes)

19:35.641 --> 19:38.642
It's really not safe
to text while driving.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.444
Good point, brah.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.445
Grab the wheel.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.648
(tires screech)

19:46.952 --> 19:49.286
Thanks.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.555
Just take the next left
up here.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.257
Left?

19:57.263 --> 20:00.198
Sorry, bruddah,
change of plans.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.944
How's it going?

20:13.979 --> 20:15.947
He's not gonna be
taking the truck.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.317
Let's go.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.559
CHIN:
<i>Paul, we know your nightclub</i>

20:28.594 --> 20:29.560
is tanking.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.328
We know that you got
creditors coming after you.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.297
We know that
that $50,000 bonus

20:33.332 --> 20:36.000
would have gone a long way
to saving your ass.

20:36.035 --> 20:39.470
So you think I killed Mitch
for that bonus money.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.338
Well, you're a sharp guy.
Yeah, that's...

20:41.373 --> 20:44.842
that's a great theory and all,
but here's the thing...

20:46.845 --> 20:47.911
...I didn't do it.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.613
So...

20:49.648 --> 20:51.815
sorry you had
to waste your time.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.885
But since you have me here,

20:54.920 --> 20:57.488
what kind of car
are you driving?

20:57.523 --> 21:01.358
Because we have some incredible
lease programs right now.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.761
Okay, the only thing I want
to hear out of you right now

21:03.796 --> 21:05.663
is your alibi for last night,
assuming you have one.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.797
You got one of those?

21:06.832 --> 21:08.499
I do.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.367
Uh, after work,
I went for sushi.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.435
Nobu, of course.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.371
And since you seem
to have such a problem

21:14.406 --> 21:16.807
believing anything
a car salesman would say,

21:16.842 --> 21:18.409
try asking the valet.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.077
Or, uh, Tina, the hostess.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.578
Or the four friends

21:21.613 --> 21:22.913
I had dinner with.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.615
Or...

21:24.650 --> 21:28.385
try asking the blonde
I took back to her hotel.

21:28.420 --> 21:32.956
I think her name was Jennifer,
but I might be wrong on that.

21:32.991 --> 21:34.792
I don't know.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.661
Now, if there is
nothing else, uh...

21:37.696 --> 21:39.496
I've got some metal to shift.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.865
I left five deals up in the air.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.634
Sit your ass down.
- (groans)

21:43.669 --> 21:45.736
Unless you have
something useful to add,

21:45.771 --> 21:47.871
we're gonna run
your alibi, okay?

21:47.906 --> 21:50.774
It's gonna take a little
while, so get comfortable.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.877
In the meantime, we'll tell your
boss that you're tied up here.

21:53.912 --> 21:55.813
I'm sure your coworkers
will be happy to take some of

21:55.848 --> 21:57.381
those deals off your hands.
(door buzzes)

21:57.416 --> 21:58.749
No, wait, wait, wait!
(door opens)

21:58.784 --> 21:59.817
Just wait.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.086
Uh... (sighs)

22:02.121 --> 22:04.688
I guess there was
the phone call.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.990
Phone call.

22:07.025 --> 22:09.827
Yeah. Um...
(clears throat)

22:09.862 --> 22:13.630
Last night, when I was
leaving the dealership, uh...

22:13.665 --> 22:15.966
I passed by Mitch's office and
I-I overhead him on the phone.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.801
I didn't get the details,

22:17.836 --> 22:19.837
but the conversation
sounded pretty heated.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.439
I mean, Mitch was pissed.

22:22.474 --> 22:23.774
And you get to
work the next day,

22:23.809 --> 22:25.109
you found out Mitch
has been killed,

22:25.144 --> 22:26.710
but you don't... you
don't think to tell

22:26.745 --> 22:28.712
the cops about
that phone call?

22:28.747 --> 22:30.714
Well, I was busy.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.583
You know...

22:32.618 --> 22:34.151
stealing those leads.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.019
(laughs)

22:36.054 --> 22:39.523
Hey, come on. Mitch would've
done the same thing.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.127
CHIN:
<i>Well, it looks like</i>

22:43.162 --> 22:44.128
Paul's alibi checks out.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.763
Multiple witnesses account for

22:45.798 --> 22:48.532
his movements last night.
Oh, well. Back to square one.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.868
KONO: Hey, I pulled the phone
records from the dealership.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.904
It turns out the phone call
that Paul overheard last night

22:53.939 --> 22:56.740
was between Mitch and
the dealership stock manager.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.610
Mitch called him
to find out if the car

22:59.645 --> 23:02.012
that he'd taken a deposit on
was ready for delivery.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.747
The stock manager told him

23:03.782 --> 23:05.816
that another salesman
had sold it to somebody else,

23:05.851 --> 23:08.185
and when Mitch found out,
he went through the roof.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.386
Well, hell, I ain't surprised.

23:09.421 --> 23:12.189
You violating rule number one,
boosting somebody's sale.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.892
That's something you just
don't do in this trade.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.528
Okay, so maybe Mitch confronts
this other salesman,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.897
things get heated,
Mitch winds up dead.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.165
We know who stole the sale?

23:21.200 --> 23:22.533
(knock on door)

23:22.568 --> 23:24.535
Hey, Bob-o. You got a sec?

23:24.570 --> 23:25.936
I-I sure do.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.974
Yeah, I just got
a quick question for you.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.643
By any chance, did you, uh,

23:32.678 --> 23:34.211
happen to kill Mitch last night?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.647
Wha... What?

23:36.682 --> 23:38.048
Wh-Why on earth are you...

23:38.083 --> 23:39.850
I mean, why are you asking<i> me?</i>

23:39.885 --> 23:43.020
Well, Bob, for one thing,
that key chain of yours.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.756
You don't really strike
me as the sparkly

23:45.791 --> 23:47.624
stiletto heel type, you know?

23:47.659 --> 23:49.726
I don't know what that has to do
with anything,

23:49.761 --> 23:52.863
but if you must know,
those keys belong to my wife.

23:52.898 --> 23:54.565
Oh.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.233
Oh, well, that makes
perfect sense.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.168
Yeah. Why you got them?

23:58.203 --> 24:00.838
(scoffs) She needed new tires,

24:00.873 --> 24:02.973
so I brought her car
to work today.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.942
New tires. Yeah, you got to get
that taken care of.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.510
Good thinking. Good thinking.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.812
So, I guess you just took
a cab home last night?

24:08.847 --> 24:11.515
I mean, the only reason I'm
asking is 'cause I just, uh...

24:11.550 --> 24:14.718
happen to notice that your car
is in the parking lot as well.

24:14.753 --> 24:16.854
She dropped her own car off.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.088
Oh.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.823
Well, all right.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.692
Never mind. (laughs)

24:21.727 --> 24:23.694
You know, you're real quick
on your feet, Bob.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.562
I could learn a lot from you.

24:25.597 --> 24:26.697
Didn't you tell
me you were

24:26.732 --> 24:28.098
Salesman of the
Year, '07 to '09?

24:28.133 --> 24:29.199
Yeah, I was.

24:29.234 --> 24:32.503
Don't be so modest, Bob.
Look at this!

24:32.538 --> 24:34.104
Two trophies here,
Salesman of the Year,

24:34.139 --> 24:36.974
2007<i> and</i> 2009.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.243
What happened to 2008?

24:39.278 --> 24:42.179
L-Look, I-I wish we could
keep talking here,

24:42.214 --> 24:44.982
but I-I really... I need to get
back to these lease agreements.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.283
Oh. My bad.
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.819
Hey. Always be closing, right?

24:48.854 --> 24:50.888
(laughs)

24:50.923 --> 24:53.257
I almost tripped
over this thing.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.261
Oh, that's kind of
a weird placement

24:57.296 --> 24:59.730
for a plant, Bob,
don't you think?

24:59.765 --> 25:01.598
Hey, brother,
if you're trying

25:01.633 --> 25:03.600
to get your luck to change,
you better get some feng shui

25:03.635 --> 25:05.302
going on up in here;
I'm not feeling it right now.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.004
Tell you what,
let me help you out.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.805
Why don't we move this over...

25:08.840 --> 25:11.141
Uh, just leave it! Leave it!
No, it's no trouble at all.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.011
Don't worry about it.
It's just... Ooh, ooh. Oh.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.812
Ooh, Bob.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.182
That looks like blood, Bob.

25:19.217 --> 25:21.051
Whoops.

25:23.989 --> 25:26.590
Huh? What's the matter?

25:27.626 --> 25:29.760
Oh. Oh, yeah.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.328
You got to believe me.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.664
I didn't mean for
this to happen.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.767
So, you just bashed Mitch's
head in about five, six times

25:36.802 --> 25:39.303
with one of these trophies
by accident?

25:39.338 --> 25:41.572
I had a buyer who was ready
to sign on a car.

25:41.607 --> 25:42.906
But he was very particular.

25:42.941 --> 25:46.076
He would only take silver
with certain options.

25:46.111 --> 25:49.046
And it just so happens
that that exact same model

25:49.081 --> 25:51.648
came in in inventory.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.885
Except, Mitch already
had a deposit on it.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.187
But I know you, Bob.
Always be closing.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.323
You didn't let that stop you,
did you?

25:59.358 --> 26:00.958
(groans) I...

26:00.993 --> 26:02.626
Watch out for the blood.

26:02.661 --> 26:03.927
I-I was desperate.

26:03.962 --> 26:05.295
Look, i-if I don't
make my quota,

26:05.330 --> 26:07.230
I'm out of a job.

26:07.265 --> 26:09.633
I-I figured Mitch would be
pissed when he found out,

26:09.668 --> 26:11.301
but I was wrong.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.337
He went absolutely crazy.

26:13.372 --> 26:16.607
Really? Well, what happened?
Sit down, tell me about it.

26:16.642 --> 26:17.575
He stormed in here, and he...

26:17.610 --> 26:19.843
he said I had to get
the buyer on the phone

26:19.878 --> 26:21.111
and-and unwind the deal.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.245
Said he didn't care
what I...

26:22.281 --> 26:25.248
what I said, but he had
to have the car back right away.

26:25.283 --> 26:27.317
Which, as you know,
it's impossible to do.

26:27.352 --> 26:30.220
I-I didn't want him
to go to the boss.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.357
So, uh... I even offered
to give him his commission back.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.792
And that's when
he-he attacked me.

26:35.827 --> 26:38.228
Oh, so it was
self-defense, then?

26:38.263 --> 26:40.230
I didn't mean to kill him.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.232
I just wanted him to stop.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.734
Then, when you realize
he's dead,

26:43.769 --> 26:45.369
now you got a real problem.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.838
I guess you had to improvise
then, huh? What'd you do?

26:47.873 --> 26:49.106
Just wait till everybody left,

26:49.141 --> 26:52.175
then put Mitch in the trunk of
his own car and drove around,

26:52.210 --> 26:54.711
looking for a spot
to dump the body?

26:54.746 --> 26:58.382
Only, you couldn't do that
before you ran out of gas.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.117
So you just left the car there,

27:00.152 --> 27:03.987
and then took a cab
or something home, right?

27:04.022 --> 27:06.657
Next day, you just wake up,
and you get in your wife's car

27:06.692 --> 27:08.425
and just drive
to work, right?

27:08.460 --> 27:11.161
That about the gist of it, Bob?

27:11.196 --> 27:14.131
Look, there's got to be
a way we can figure out

27:14.166 --> 27:17.267
how to keep all this
in this office.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.069
All right, well...

27:21.807 --> 27:23.874
I'm listening.

27:23.909 --> 27:26.943
What if I give you
all my commission next month?

27:26.978 --> 27:29.146
Uh, quarter.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.714
I mean year.

27:30.749 --> 27:33.183
You can have it all.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.419
What do you say, Roy?

27:35.454 --> 27:37.421
Come on. (chuckles)

27:37.456 --> 27:39.756
Let's make a deal.

27:39.791 --> 27:42.192
Hold on, Bob.

27:42.227 --> 27:45.162
You still think
I'm a car salesman?

27:45.197 --> 27:46.897
Bob.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.801
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

28:01.113 --> 28:02.813
Time to pack it up there, Roy.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.315
Yeah.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.717
What's up?

28:06.752 --> 28:09.319
Chin, something about this
doesn't add up.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.955
Doesn't it seem odd to you that
Mitch would be this desperate

28:11.990 --> 28:13.857
to get one car back?

28:13.892 --> 28:15.492
Well, these guys are sharks.
You said so yourself.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.560
Yeah, I know, I know.

28:16.595 --> 28:19.730
But even considering
the dog eat dog of it all...

28:21.533 --> 28:24.501
...do you think it makes sense
for a guy to come in

28:24.536 --> 28:26.937
and attack his coworker--
physically attack him--

28:26.972 --> 28:29.005
over a $500 commission?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.074
May have a point there.

28:31.109 --> 28:33.043
Well, I did some digging.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.478
Look at that.

28:36.148 --> 28:39.983
Those are Mitch's sales reports
for the last two years.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.986
And every other month
for the last two years,

28:43.021 --> 28:47.491
he's sold the same exact car
to the same exact person.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.093
Who the hell buys
that many of the same car?

28:50.128 --> 28:53.063
A gentleman by the name
of Lee Sung.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.965
KONO:<i> Here's what we know</i>
<i>about Lee Sung.</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:57.534
He came from Seoul
six years ago.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.169
He runs a local body shop.

28:59.204 --> 29:01.304
According to HPD's
Narcotics Division,

29:01.339 --> 29:04.107
he's a known affiliate
of the KFS syndicate.

29:04.142 --> 29:05.942
It's a Korean street gang

29:05.977 --> 29:09.045
that controls most of
the heroin trade on the island.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.016
Okay, but most guys in the
drug trade go for flashy cars.

29:13.051 --> 29:15.485
They don't normally order
economy cars in bulk.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.087
STEVE:
Yeah, there's more.

29:17.122 --> 29:18.822
HPD searched
Mitch Lawson's house.

29:18.857 --> 29:20.190
They found a secret safe

29:20.225 --> 29:22.159
with close to a million dollars
cash inside.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.460
Oh.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.328
Well, that ain't car money.
That's drug money.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.797
All right.

29:26.832 --> 29:27.931
So, Mitch must've gotten
involved in Sung's

29:27.966 --> 29:29.866
heroin business,
and those car sales

29:29.901 --> 29:31.334
were a way of laundering money.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.470
Wait a minute, there's
another possibility.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.339
Lou, where are those cars
manufactured?

29:36.374 --> 29:39.409
Well, the parts were mostly made
in Japan and-and Canada.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.379
But the final product
is assembled in India.

29:42.414 --> 29:46.216
Okay, India is one of Asia's
major trade centers for heroin.

29:46.251 --> 29:47.851
So, you're saying
these cars were used

29:47.886 --> 29:49.586
to smuggle dope
into Hawaii?

29:49.621 --> 29:51.388
Well, it explains
why Mitch was so desperate

29:51.423 --> 29:53.490
to get that vehicle back.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.959
It also means whoever
Bob Mason sold the car to

29:55.994 --> 29:58.228
is driving around
a payload of drugs.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.597
Well, assuming that Sung hasn't
tracked them down already.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.200
All right, Kono, get an APB
out on that vehicle,

30:03.235 --> 30:04.835
and notify SWAT, have
them meet all of us

30:04.870 --> 30:06.102
down at Sung's body shop.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.838
All right, guys?

30:07.873 --> 30:09.139
(machines whirring)

30:21.887 --> 30:23.420
Five-O! Let's see your hands!

30:32.430 --> 30:33.831
STEVE:
Hey!

30:35.400 --> 30:37.034
(tires screech)

30:46.411 --> 30:48.411
Well, Sung's not here.

30:48.446 --> 30:49.980
HPD's trying to track him down.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.148
Well, I ran every VIN number
on this sheet.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.351
The car that was sold out
from under Mitch is not here.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.353
That means the buyer
could still be in danger.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.989
Well, hopefully not for long,
because HPD just spotted

30:59.024 --> 31:01.191
the car, and they're pulling him over now.
<i>(siren wails)</i>

31:02.193 --> 31:03.327
(sighs)

31:05.931 --> 31:07.597
Sorry, Officer.
It's a new car.

31:07.632 --> 31:10.100
Um, was I speeding?

31:10.135 --> 31:11.968
Sir, I'm not pulling you over
for a violation.

31:12.003 --> 31:14.971
We have a very serious situation
here. For your own safety,

31:15.006 --> 31:17.374
I need you to exit the vehicle
and come with...

31:17.409 --> 31:19.276
(tires screeching)

31:24.382 --> 31:25.382
Get out of my car.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.461
CHIN:
So, no witnesses.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.464
Squad car had a dash cam in
it, but the perp shot it out.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.199
I'm gonna get it over
to the lab anyway,

31:43.234 --> 31:45.369
see if they can pull
something off the hard drive.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.472
Looks like they got
what they came for.

31:49.507 --> 31:52.175
All right.
Here's what I don't get.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.544
Okay, most smuggling operations,
they expect to write off

31:54.579 --> 31:56.246
a certain percentage
of their shipments.

31:56.281 --> 31:57.948
It's the cost
of doing business.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.582
Everybody knows that.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.252
So even if this car was loaded
with product, to kill a cop

32:02.287 --> 32:05.355
and a civilian in broad daylight
doesn't make any sense to me.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.457
Yeah, you're right.
They wouldn't.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.192
Wouldn't be worth the risk.

32:09.227 --> 32:11.228
So why would they do it?

32:13.198 --> 32:14.998
<i>(door buzzes)</i>

32:23.308 --> 32:25.508
Mr. Sung in the flesh.

32:25.543 --> 32:28.111
I'd say it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

32:28.146 --> 32:29.446
But it's not.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.982
You and Mitch--
slick operation, huh?

32:32.017 --> 32:34.084
I mean,
judging by the mountain

32:34.119 --> 32:35.986
of cash we found
at Mitch's house,

32:36.021 --> 32:39.089
I'd say business has been good.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.626
No witty retort to that one?

32:43.661 --> 32:45.662
Okay, then maybe you can help me
understand something else.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.530
You're under the radar,
you're making a bunch of money,

32:47.565 --> 32:48.598
things are good.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.700
And then this double homicide
in broad daylight,

32:50.735 --> 32:52.168
killing a cop no less.

32:52.203 --> 32:54.537
Explain that to me,

32:54.572 --> 32:56.272
'cause that's a
pretty ballsy move.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.708
You had to know that
would get my attention.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.477
I'm sure you hear this
all the time,

33:00.512 --> 33:02.545
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.747
Nice try, nice try.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.516
But we found the car
and the bodies

33:06.551 --> 33:07.650
you left with it.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.252
And if you add
your drug charges

33:09.287 --> 33:11.221
onto that,

33:11.256 --> 33:14.124
you're looking at the end
of your days as a free man.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.161
Okay, look, all right,

33:18.196 --> 33:19.662
I've been smuggling drugs
onto the island,

33:19.697 --> 33:22.432
but like you said, my game
is all about avoiding cops,

33:22.467 --> 33:24.367
not capping them in the streets.

33:24.402 --> 33:26.169
Truth is, Mitch was no longer
handling transpo for us.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.170
Really?

33:27.205 --> 33:28.371
He called a couple weeks back

33:28.406 --> 33:29.706
to say that
he had a better offer

33:29.741 --> 33:31.641
and was calling time
on our arrangement.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.675
You just accepted that?

33:32.710 --> 33:34.377
Yeah, I had to.
Oh, yeah?

33:34.412 --> 33:36.246
(phone vibrating)
Yeah, I was in the process of-of

33:36.281 --> 33:38.548
sourcing a new smuggling route
onto Oahu.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.250
Was I annoyed with Mitch?

33:40.285 --> 33:42.252
Sure. That<i> haole</i> screwed me.

33:42.287 --> 33:45.155
But I'm not suicidal enough
to kill a cop over it.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.556
All right?

33:48.426 --> 33:51.795
You sit tight.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.396
(door buzzes, opens)
Really?

33:53.431 --> 33:54.831
KONO:
<i>So lab tore that car apart.</i>

33:54.866 --> 33:56.766
There wasn't any evidence
of heroin,

33:56.801 --> 33:59.069
or any other drug
for that matter.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.638
So there's no drugs in the car;
what's in that car?

34:01.673 --> 34:03.473
We just don't know yet.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.175
I just got this
off the dash cam.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.710
It's pretty damaged, but the
techs were able to salvage it.

34:07.745 --> 34:09.312
(computer beeping)

34:12.650 --> 34:14.317
That's our shooter.

34:14.352 --> 34:15.618
Can you enhance that?

34:15.653 --> 34:17.054
(beeping)

34:21.860 --> 34:24.461
OLIVIA: Yeah, I recognize him.
He was here yesterday.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.197
He came in to pick up a car
he bought from Mitch.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.432
Thing is, it had
already been sold.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.334
Right, by Bob Mason, yeah?

34:31.369 --> 34:32.836
Okay, how'd this guy react

34:32.871 --> 34:35.338
once he realized
the car wasn't here anymore?

34:35.373 --> 34:37.540
Not well. He was upset.

34:37.575 --> 34:39.242
Ken, the manager, stepped in.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.111
Took him into his office
and offered him

34:41.146 --> 34:42.846
a discount on another vehicle.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.715
Let me guess--
he didn't want another vehicle.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.383
He actually agreed
to take a test drive.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.852
But when Ken came back

34:48.887 --> 34:53.223
from photocopying the guy's
driver's license, he was gone.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.327
Excuse us for a sec.

34:57.362 --> 34:59.395
That's the same move I use.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.631
You agree to take a test drive
to get the manager

35:01.666 --> 35:03.500
out of his office,
you go into his office,

35:03.535 --> 35:04.834
get on his computer
and find out

35:04.869 --> 35:06.336
the name and address
of the buyer.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.571
Right, once he's got
this kid's address,

35:08.606 --> 35:10.473
he goes and
follows this kid,

35:10.508 --> 35:12.342
waits for the chance
to jack the car.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.277
But then, the coppers show up.

35:14.312 --> 35:16.379
Now you're forced to improvise.

35:16.414 --> 35:19.149
Excuse me, you were saying,
uh, the guy left

35:19.184 --> 35:21.484
before your manager
came on back to his office.

35:21.519 --> 35:23.419
That must mean you still have
his driver's license.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.454
OLIVIA:
Yes.

35:28.259 --> 35:29.426
Thank you very much.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.496
GROVER:
"Tad Smith."

35:33.531 --> 35:37.467
Why do I get the feeling
that's not his real name?

35:37.502 --> 35:39.369
CHIN:
<i>You guys were right.</i>

35:39.404 --> 35:41.404
The driver's license was a fake.
KONO: So the good news

35:41.439 --> 35:44.474
is that we ran the photo and
we got a hit with facial rec.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.276
The bad news is
that's where the good news ends.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.710
Suspect's name is Jared Namal.

35:47.745 --> 35:48.611
(computer beeping)

35:48.646 --> 35:50.547
He's been on a FBI
and Interpol watch list

35:50.582 --> 35:52.582
for the past six months.

35:52.617 --> 35:53.583
For what?

35:53.618 --> 35:54.851
Namal's believed
to have ties

35:54.886 --> 35:57.320
to several active terror cells.

35:57.355 --> 36:00.256
Wait a minute, I thought
this is was a narco case.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.691
What's a terrorist
doing involved?

36:01.726 --> 36:02.659
(phone vibrates)

36:02.694 --> 36:04.627
GROVER: Two to one says
that's more bad news.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.396
Max.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.931
Yeah, Max.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.332
Wait, hey...

36:09.367 --> 36:10.667
Max, slow down.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.536
I can't understand you. Hold on.

36:13.705 --> 36:14.671
Go ahead.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.206
MAX:
I said, the dead car buyer

36:16.241 --> 36:19.676
had traces of gamma radiation
in his system.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.611
The only way
that would be possible

36:21.646 --> 36:23.880
is if he was exposed
to some sort of volatile

36:23.915 --> 36:25.248
radioactive materials.

36:25.283 --> 36:26.749
Possibly uranium.

36:26.784 --> 36:29.285
I have to finish
putting the lab on lockdown.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.487
When I have more information,
I will give you a call.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.522
(phone beeps)

36:37.829 --> 36:39.562
That car was being used

36:39.597 --> 36:43.433
to transport
radioactive material.

36:43.468 --> 36:46.403
Namal could be looking
to build a dirty bomb.

36:56.748 --> 36:57.747
(air hissing)

37:10.295 --> 37:11.427
CHIN:
<i>DHS is allocating</i>

37:11.462 --> 37:12.294
all available resources.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.563
The director's being
briefed as we speak.

37:13.598 --> 37:14.631
All right.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.300
Namal is gonna be looking
to maximize casualties.

37:17.335 --> 37:18.968
So we need to focus on public,
highly-populated areas.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.703
KONO:
I got something.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.405
I ran Namal's financials.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.306
He subleased a unit

37:23.341 --> 37:24.607
in an apartment
complex two weeks ago.

37:24.642 --> 37:25.742
And satellite surveillance

37:25.777 --> 37:27.877
shows his car's parked there
right now.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.646
Let's go.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.616
STEVE:
<i>Jared Namal, Five-O!</i>

37:34.752 --> 37:35.852
Fall back, fall back!

37:42.727 --> 37:44.661
He's in here.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.029
Secure the perimeter. Gun!
(gunshot)

37:54.372 --> 37:55.371
KONO:
Oh, my God.

37:55.406 --> 37:57.040
What's that all over his face?

37:57.075 --> 37:58.741
It's radiation poisoning.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.477
CHIN:
McGarrett!

38:02.547 --> 38:04.981
McGarrett, get in here!
I think we got it.

38:06.718 --> 38:09.386
(Geiger counter clicking)

38:11.356 --> 38:13.423
Radiation levels
are off the charts.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.624
All right, everybody, fall back.

38:14.659 --> 38:16.559
We need to evacuate
this building,

38:16.594 --> 38:19.662
get DHS in here right away.

38:19.697 --> 38:20.997
Let's go.

police radio chatter)

38:34.512 --> 38:36.513

38:57.435 --> 38:59.469
Hey.
- Hey, Chin.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.003
Kono's inside.

39:01.038 --> 39:02.772
Actually...

39:02.807 --> 39:04.774
I came to talk to you.

39:04.809 --> 39:08.411
Uh-oh.
Sounds serious.

39:08.446 --> 39:09.879
We, uh, gonna talk
about our feelings, huh?

39:09.914 --> 39:11.381
Should I get you
a beer first?

39:11.416 --> 39:12.415
Yeah, kumbaya.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.586
Actually, uh...

39:16.621 --> 39:18.855
I did want to say thank you.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.156
What you did for me yesterday,

39:20.191 --> 39:21.824
coming all the way
down to Mexico,

39:21.859 --> 39:23.826
that was above and beyond.

39:23.861 --> 39:26.729
And I think it was a violation
of your parole as well.

39:26.764 --> 39:28.431
Yeah, well, you don't
have to say anything.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.700
Actually, you know what, I do.

39:30.735 --> 39:33.770
Listen, man...

39:33.805 --> 39:36.973
when you and Kono first got
together, I was hard on you.

39:37.008 --> 39:40.543
I'll always do what I can
to protect my family, you know.

39:40.578 --> 39:44.580
But time and again
I've watched you put her first.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.449
And when you came down to Mexico

39:46.484 --> 39:48.752
and put yourself
on the line for me...

39:50.755 --> 39:52.088
...it meant a lot.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.991
You know, I meant, uh...

39:55.026 --> 39:57.960
you don't have to say anything
to my parole officer, right?

39:57.995 --> 39:58.961
(both chuckle)

39:58.996 --> 40:00.196
Right?

40:00.231 --> 40:02.031
All right, all right, all right.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.599
Your secret's safe with me.

40:03.634 --> 40:06.135
Thank you.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.471
I will take one of those beers.

40:08.506 --> 40:09.605
All right.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.741
Coming right up.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.876
Thanks.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.145
Yes, sir, DHS is currently
analyzing the weapon.

40:16.180 --> 40:18.448
And hopefully we can trace
where the nuclear material

40:18.483 --> 40:19.416
was sourced from.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.451
But the minute I get
some new information,

40:21.486 --> 40:24.587
you'll be the first to know.

40:24.622 --> 40:25.721
Thank you very much.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.490
Yes, sir.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.158
Bad time?
- No, it's all good.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.927
Just, uh...

40:30.962 --> 40:32.628
just getting done here.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.764
The guest suite is all yours.

40:34.799 --> 40:36.032
Actually, that's not
why I'm here.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.633
I was doing some
apartment hunting.

40:37.668 --> 40:38.968
I found a great listing.

40:39.003 --> 40:40.770
It's clean, roomy,

40:40.805 --> 40:42.505
close to work.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.707
What's the problem?

40:44.742 --> 40:47.643
Look familiar?

40:47.678 --> 40:49.145
<i>(knock on door)</i>

40:51.682 --> 40:53.549
Oh, Commander, what a
pleasant surprise. Hey.

40:53.584 --> 40:54.851
Please come in.
Hey, thank you.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.486
Thanks, Max.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.154
What brings you around
in the neighborhood?

40:58.189 --> 41:00.723
Oh, I'm, uh...

41:02.260 --> 41:04.093
...here about the rental.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.630
(sighs)

41:07.665 --> 41:09.098
Yes, uh...

41:09.133 --> 41:10.933
well, I was just
gauging the temperature

41:10.968 --> 41:12.134
of the local leasing market.

41:12.169 --> 41:13.803
Sabrina and I are
thinking about upgrading

41:13.838 --> 41:15.738
to a bigger space.

41:15.773 --> 41:17.540
You know, Max,
I hear your dollar

41:17.575 --> 41:19.876
goes a long way in Africa.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.782
Come on, Max, I mean,
it wasn't-wasn't too hard

41:26.817 --> 41:29.685
to piece together.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.787
And it wasn't just
you hiring a new M.E.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.257
or-or listing your apartment;
the minute you got back,

41:34.292 --> 41:36.659
I had a feeling we'd be
having this conversation,

41:36.694 --> 41:38.828
because you changed
when you went away, Max.

41:38.863 --> 41:41.998
It was clear that that
experience really affected you.

41:45.570 --> 41:48.237
Hawaii's the only home
I've ever known.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.840
Leaving it
is a monumental decision.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.576
I just thought...

41:53.611 --> 41:56.979
in some ways you'd be...
disappointed with me.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.849
Max...

41:59.884 --> 42:03.185
you're a man who is driven by
the desire to help other people.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.721
That's the most important thing
in the world.

42:05.756 --> 42:08.324
I'm proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.260
And also you should know that,
from personal experience,

42:11.295 --> 42:14.263
it doesn't matter how far
you travel or where you go,

42:14.298 --> 42:16.265
you can always
come back home, okay?

42:16.300 --> 42:19.602
And if you ever do
decide to do that,

42:19.637 --> 42:23.606
you got a job and got your
Five-O<i> ohana</i> waiting for you.

42:23.641 --> 42:25.708
Mahalo.

42:25.743 --> 42:26.709
Yeah, man.

42:26.744 --> 42:27.710
(phone vibrating)

42:27.745 --> 42:30.246
Oh, I believe
that's you.

42:30.281 --> 42:33.016
Excuse me for a second.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.720
Yeah, Lou, what's good?

42:37.755 --> 42:39.589
GROVER:
Listen, we got a real problem.

42:39.624 --> 42:41.958
DHS X-rayed that suitcase.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.826
They found it to be empty.

42:43.861 --> 42:45.094
What are you talking about?

42:45.129 --> 42:46.762
How is that possible?

42:46.797 --> 42:49.298
Well, apparently, the levels
we detected at the apartment

42:49.333 --> 42:51.601
were from residual radiation.

42:53.704 --> 42:56.072
What if we were too late
and Namal has already

42:56.107 --> 42:58.207
passed that uranium off
to somebody else?

42:58.242 --> 43:00.109
That's right.

43:00.144 --> 43:01.744
And whoever
that someone else is,

43:01.779 --> 43:04.280
they now have enough of
that stuff in their possession

43:04.315 --> 43:05.315
to kill half the population
on this island.
