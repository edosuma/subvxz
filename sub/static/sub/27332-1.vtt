"THERE ARE NO WEEDS
AND NO WORTHLESS MEN.

00:36.713 --> 00:38.921
THERE ARE ONLY BAD FARMERS."
VICTOR HUGO

00:39.588 --> 00:41.671
NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:26.171 --> 02:30.130
BAD SEEDS

02:48.921 --> 02:49.921
Thief!

02:50.338 --> 02:51.588
Thief! Help!

02:51.671 --> 02:53.380
-Don't move!
-Stop that thief!

03:16.421 --> 03:17.255
Shit.

03:23.171 --> 03:25.421
What the fuck?

03:33.880 --> 03:37.130
THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO HELP OTHERS,
ASSHOLE!

03:41.963 --> 03:43.171
Stop sulking.

03:43.255 --> 03:45.338
-I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

03:46.546 --> 03:47.671
I do it for them.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.213
Sure!

03:49.296 --> 03:52.213
If they didn't get a note,
what would they tell their friends?

03:53.130 --> 03:55.421
"I got robbed by an old woman."

03:55.505 --> 03:56.338
I'm not old!

03:56.421 --> 03:59.505
Thanks to your note,
it's me they're going to blame.

04:00.088 --> 04:01.046
I'll wallop you.

04:01.130 --> 04:03.213
I'd never hit an old woman.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.296
Who says I'm old?

04:05.755 --> 04:06.588
My eyes.

04:08.088 --> 04:09.546
-Your name.
-Monique?

04:09.630 --> 04:12.171
Yeah, Monique. Like you're surprised.

04:13.338 --> 04:14.630
Just be old.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.838
I'm not old, I'm experienced, OK?

04:17.921 --> 04:20.338
In a queue, people let you go first.

04:21.171 --> 04:23.796
They offer you a seat on the metro.
You're old.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.921
I don't want to brag,
but men do come on to me.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.171
Come on to you?

04:28.255 --> 04:33.088
You never know where "have a seat"
may lead you.

04:33.171 --> 04:35.671
It leads to "have a seat." Period.

04:35.755 --> 04:38.463
Not at all. Men court me all the time.

04:39.088 --> 04:41.088
-You said "court"?
-Yes.

04:41.171 --> 04:42.505
Proves you're old.

04:42.588 --> 04:45.171
Look, it's not my fault
you're a total oaf.

04:45.255 --> 04:47.880
You pick up, but real men court.

04:47.963 --> 04:48.921
One question.

04:49.130 --> 04:52.338
On the street,
do they think you're a girl...

04:53.338 --> 04:55.088
my mother,

04:55.171 --> 04:57.296
or the old lady from  Titanic?

04:57.880 --> 04:58.713
Silly!

04:59.130 --> 05:01.380
I adore you. It's OK to be old.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.213
Can you finish? I have to go.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.255
-Where?
-Courting.

05:49.463 --> 05:51.255
OK, great. OK.

05:51.338 --> 05:54.588
Screw Jay-Z, OK?
I've known her for ten years.

05:55.755 --> 05:56.755
No way.

06:00.463 --> 06:01.588
Forget that.

06:01.671 --> 06:02.755
She's here?

06:02.838 --> 06:04.463
She canceled.

06:05.463 --> 06:06.505
Disappointed?

06:06.588 --> 06:08.130
-You bet.
-You like her?

06:08.213 --> 06:09.213
I love her.

06:09.296 --> 06:10.421
-Yeah?
-Yes.

06:10.505 --> 06:12.005
If you're discreet about it,

06:12.505 --> 06:15.671
give me your number
and I'll introduce you next time.

06:15.755 --> 06:18.505
-Really?
-If you like.

06:19.005 --> 06:20.588
-That's so kind.
-Be discreet.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.505
Promise.

06:22.171 --> 06:23.921
-What's your name?
-Wael.

06:24.796 --> 06:26.713
-And what's hers?
- Sarah.

06:27.838 --> 06:29.546
-Sarah what?
-No idea.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.338
And on your phone?

06:31.421 --> 06:32.255
Sarah "Terminal."

06:32.338 --> 06:34.213
She's sick? Shame on you!

06:34.296 --> 06:36.296
No, like airport terminal.

06:37.588 --> 06:39.255
So you will call her?

06:39.338 --> 06:41.088
That's your three questions.

06:41.421 --> 06:44.630
Can't you call just one back?

06:44.713 --> 06:46.005
Can we go?

06:46.088 --> 06:48.921
-No.
-Hello. Need a hand?

06:49.005 --> 06:51.088
-It's OK.
-I don't mind.

06:51.171 --> 06:52.921
Give me a break, OK!

06:54.255 --> 06:55.130
Youngsters!

06:55.213 --> 06:56.796
Helping or courting?

06:57.630 --> 06:58.463
Stop it.

06:58.546 --> 06:59.755
Ah, I see one.

07:00.171 --> 07:01.213
An old man on his own.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.338
Full cart. Let's go.

07:03.421 --> 07:04.255
OK.

07:09.838 --> 07:10.671
Monique?

07:11.546 --> 07:12.755
Do I know you?

07:13.338 --> 07:15.213
-It's me. Victor.
-Victor?

07:16.296 --> 07:17.338
Victor. But...

07:18.338 --> 07:20.713
-Victor!
-Incredible!

07:20.796 --> 07:23.005
How long has it been? Thirty years?

07:23.088 --> 07:24.921
What are you doing here?

07:25.380 --> 07:26.213
Amazing!

07:27.671 --> 07:29.213
-But--
-Your bag.

07:29.713 --> 07:31.463
-What?
-He stole it.

07:31.546 --> 07:33.213
I never liked it anyway.

07:33.296 --> 07:34.630
So what's new?

07:34.713 --> 07:35.796
He can't...

07:35.880 --> 07:37.796
-Outrageous!
-No, really!

08:53.921 --> 08:56.005
-Not so tight!
-Shut up!

08:56.088 --> 08:57.005
That hurts!

09:03.046 --> 09:04.088
What's this?

09:09.505 --> 09:12.880
We don't do it regularly.

09:13.671 --> 09:15.380
The thing is it's...

09:15.796 --> 09:16.921
It's more like...

09:17.630 --> 09:20.921
a hobby than a professional activity.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.005
Monique, you're no thief.

09:24.088 --> 09:24.963
Shit.

09:25.046 --> 09:26.088
Quiet, Wael!

09:26.171 --> 09:28.088
Don't tell him my name!

09:28.171 --> 09:30.921
You didn't steal, you helped people.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.796
It's for this fool!

09:32.880 --> 09:34.546
I keep him out of jail.

09:38.796 --> 09:43.171
Sorry about his arm, but he picked
the wrong day to steal your bag.

09:43.255 --> 09:44.338
Why do you say that?

09:44.421 --> 09:45.796
No reason.

09:46.546 --> 09:48.713
Tell me. Maybe we can help.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.880
Are you a youth worker?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.546
No, so you can't help me.

09:56.088 --> 09:58.213
I founded a youth club.

09:58.296 --> 10:00.255
A small thing I run alone.

10:00.755 --> 10:03.755
The guy I hired had an accident.

10:04.380 --> 10:05.338
No replacement?

10:05.421 --> 10:08.796
I need to interview,
but who will mind the kids?

10:09.255 --> 10:10.088
Try Wael.

10:10.921 --> 10:12.588
-Are you kidding?
-Not at all.

10:13.255 --> 10:17.296
See it as compensation
for us trying to rob you.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.255
Talk about help!

10:19.880 --> 10:21.588
He'll steal the kids' bags!

10:21.671 --> 10:23.671
You've changed, Victor.

10:27.463 --> 10:28.463
Is he qualified?

10:29.588 --> 10:30.421
No.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.338
But he's full of surprises.

10:32.963 --> 10:33.796
Monique...

10:33.880 --> 10:36.630
A magician is full of surprises,
but he can't help me.

10:36.713 --> 10:39.046
He's smart. They'll love him.

10:39.130 --> 10:42.255
It's not about that.
Being nice isn't a trade.

10:42.338 --> 10:44.338
I need someone qualified.

10:44.421 --> 10:45.255
He is.

10:45.630 --> 10:47.838
You won't find anyone else now.

10:48.505 --> 10:49.796
Please, Victor.

10:51.296 --> 10:52.255
Help us.

10:54.296 --> 10:55.338
Alright.

10:56.546 --> 10:57.380
Wael!

10:58.963 --> 11:01.546
Wonderful news!
He'll take you on for the kids!

11:03.255 --> 11:04.671
-Monique!
-His idea?

11:04.755 --> 11:05.755
It wasn't mine.

11:06.505 --> 11:07.963
Just for one day.

11:08.046 --> 11:09.213
Hold on.

11:09.713 --> 11:12.088
No charges, and you're hiring me?

11:12.671 --> 11:13.505
It's unpaid.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.630
Right. I have a business trip tomorrow...

11:17.130 --> 11:18.671
You want him to press charges?

11:18.755 --> 11:19.838
But I can cancel.

11:19.921 --> 11:22.630
Everything's turned out for the best.

11:23.046 --> 11:23.880
Thank you, Victor.

11:24.296 --> 11:25.296
No, thank you.

11:25.838 --> 11:28.380
A new youth worker and a new secretary.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.796
-Secretary?
-Exactly.

11:31.671 --> 11:32.505
Anyway...

11:32.796 --> 11:34.171
See you tomorrow. Seven sharp.

11:35.088 --> 11:37.546
But... Victor, you don't have a secretary!

11:37.630 --> 11:38.880
I do now.

11:40.005 --> 11:42.380
-Ah, karma.
-Shut up.

12:19.546 --> 12:22.421
-Seriously?
-I told you. Too much makeup.

12:22.505 --> 12:24.713
It's my secretary look.

12:24.796 --> 12:26.171
I wouldn't say secretary.

12:26.255 --> 12:28.046
-What?
-You heard me.

12:28.130 --> 12:29.005
No. Explain.

12:29.921 --> 12:32.171
I'm embarrassed to look you in the eye.

12:32.796 --> 12:35.713
I'm the problem?
Look at your stupid outfit!

12:35.796 --> 12:37.421
At least I don't scream STD.

12:37.505 --> 12:39.255
You're one to talk, Mr. Wannabe.

12:39.338 --> 12:40.755
-Sorry?
-Yes!

12:40.838 --> 12:43.130
-Me a wannabe?
-You're corny.

12:43.213 --> 12:44.546
-I'm corny?
-Yes!

12:44.630 --> 12:46.755
-No way.
-No one dresses like that!

12:46.838 --> 12:47.921
You're wearing a zoo.

12:48.005 --> 12:50.380
-I fit with the times.
-Give me a break!

12:50.463 --> 12:53.421
Just go and get changed!
You're both ridiculous.

12:55.713 --> 12:58.255
-See? You're ridiculous.
-And you, too.

12:58.338 --> 12:59.630
He was looking at you.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.755
Oh, yeah? And he can keep looking.

13:01.838 --> 13:02.880
Unbelievable.

13:03.921 --> 13:05.713
Your day center's empty.

13:05.796 --> 13:07.380
It's not a day center.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.255
-It's a place for troubled kids.
-What?

13:11.338 --> 13:13.963
Twelve kids regularly expelled
from school.

13:14.755 --> 13:18.588
We offer a vacation course.
It's their last chance.

13:19.088 --> 13:21.546
-Twelve of them?
-Only six turned up.

13:22.588 --> 13:25.296
You mind them until I find a replacement.

13:25.755 --> 13:27.171
-That's it?
-Yes.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.630
One thing. The first day is compulsory.

13:30.713 --> 13:32.296
To make them come.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.130
Just the first day though.

13:34.838 --> 13:37.463
The youth worker
has to inspire them to come back.

13:37.546 --> 13:41.296
You've got to make sure
they come back tomorrow.

13:41.505 --> 13:42.671
OK. I'll try.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.088
No, don't try. Make sure.

13:45.963 --> 13:48.296
No kids tomorrow, I press charges.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.671
How did they get expelled?

13:51.546 --> 13:55.963
Talking, fighting, insolence,
absence, weapons... It all depends.

13:56.046 --> 13:56.880
Absence?

13:56.963 --> 13:59.630
So they miss school
because they missed school?

14:00.171 --> 14:02.005
You did hear him say weapons, right?

14:03.255 --> 14:04.963
They're waiting for you.

14:05.046 --> 14:05.963
It's like jail.

14:07.171 --> 14:08.963
Just an old science lab.

14:09.546 --> 14:11.213
Wael, one last thing.

14:11.838 --> 14:14.296
If they behave badly,

14:15.255 --> 14:18.755
remember a problem child
is a child with problems.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.046
Hey, boy!

14:43.380 --> 14:44.338
Please?

14:49.005 --> 14:50.171
Please?

15:21.005 --> 15:22.296
Give me something.

15:24.671 --> 15:26.046
Give me something.

16:11.005 --> 16:11.921
Hi.

16:15.130 --> 16:16.088
Hello.

16:19.380 --> 16:22.005
I spoke to you. I said "Hello."

16:22.713 --> 16:24.338
Usually people reply.

16:25.588 --> 16:28.296
That's what we call socialization.

16:31.130 --> 16:32.088
Do you speak Spanish?

16:37.921 --> 16:39.338
OK, I understand.

16:40.088 --> 16:42.005
You can't hear me.

16:43.296 --> 16:45.046
So you do understand.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.213
You're ignoring me?

16:50.921 --> 16:52.588
-Morning.
-Good morning.

16:52.671 --> 16:55.838
Give me two minutes
and we'll start the interviews.

16:55.921 --> 16:56.921
I won't be long.

16:59.630 --> 17:01.796
There are a lot of them.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.421
That's great.

17:03.505 --> 17:05.588
Your friend might be free as of tonight.

17:24.088 --> 17:26.838
It's voluntary. You didn't know?

17:27.588 --> 17:29.171
-No.
-Well, it's unpaid.

17:30.088 --> 17:31.088
OK.

17:42.630 --> 17:44.088
Yeah, red chair?

17:45.171 --> 17:47.130
No, I'm not a teacher or a youth worker.

17:48.005 --> 17:49.171
Say that again.

17:50.255 --> 17:51.338
Not funny.

17:51.421 --> 17:52.588
Out.

17:52.671 --> 17:53.880
Go on, go!

17:53.963 --> 17:55.671
Get out, OK.

17:55.755 --> 17:57.296
That's unacceptable.

17:57.963 --> 18:00.255
Go on, this is over for you.

18:00.338 --> 18:02.296
Yeah go on, play it cool.

18:02.796 --> 18:04.588
No one's impressed.

18:04.671 --> 18:05.921
I'll take him to Victor.

18:12.005 --> 18:12.880
Who is that maniac?

18:12.963 --> 18:14.921
-Where did he come from?
-He's nuts.

18:15.005 --> 18:16.130
What did he say?

18:16.838 --> 18:17.671
Moron.

18:17.755 --> 18:19.255
-What?
-No one's there.

18:19.671 --> 18:22.255
Yeah, but what did he say
to get chucked out?

18:22.338 --> 18:24.213
-I think that--
-Screw that!

18:24.296 --> 18:27.421
It's to get us to talk.
We said we wouldn't.

18:27.505 --> 18:28.880
Silence sucks.

18:28.963 --> 18:30.671
It does my head in.

18:30.755 --> 18:33.713
-Ten past eight and I've had it.
-No willpower.

18:33.796 --> 18:35.921
We stand united, OK.

18:36.005 --> 18:38.671
-We fight back.
-Nadia, chill.

18:38.755 --> 18:42.755
-It's just one day.
-It's a matter of principle!

18:42.838 --> 18:46.171
They make us come, so we protest.

18:46.421 --> 18:49.005
-Protest? We're not speaking.
-Right. A silent protest.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.546
-What?
-Nothing. We're protesting.

18:55.338 --> 18:57.130
There. That's done.

19:00.255 --> 19:03.421
So I was saying, I'm not a youth worker,
I'm not a supervisor.

19:03.505 --> 19:05.505
I'm only here for today.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.671
The guy who was due couldn't make it.

19:09.505 --> 19:10.505
Because he died.

19:11.296 --> 19:12.130
This morning.

19:14.713 --> 19:16.505
You don't want to know how?

19:19.380 --> 19:20.255
OK.

19:21.380 --> 19:25.755
And so Victor is looking for a replacement

19:25.838 --> 19:28.046
and it's hard
because he doesn't want some loser.

19:28.130 --> 19:30.046
So he's doing his best... Yes?

19:30.130 --> 19:31.755
No losers, so why am I here?

19:31.838 --> 19:34.296
-He got him.
-What?

19:34.380 --> 19:36.838
Think you're funny? Yeah? 1,000 push-ups.

19:37.588 --> 19:39.296
Now. Go on.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.671
Right, since I'm only here for a day,
let's get on with it.

19:42.755 --> 19:44.671
Who hates math and geography?

19:47.838 --> 19:51.296
I'll teach you real stuff
to use in real life.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.671
Brush your teeth. Very important.

19:53.755 --> 19:58.838
Back in the day,
slaves with good teeth were kept alive.

19:59.421 --> 20:00.588
So, brush your teeth.

20:01.171 --> 20:02.005
Especially you.

20:02.338 --> 20:03.296
You never know.

20:03.380 --> 20:06.755
They may get you again.
Don't give them the chance.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.505
Don't believe what you see in porn.

20:08.588 --> 20:10.796
Real plumbers have much less fun.

20:11.213 --> 20:13.088
-You gay?
-Huh?

20:13.171 --> 20:16.005
Change your t-shirt if you're not.

20:16.088 --> 20:19.296
You're giving off the wrong signals.
It's hard to tell.

20:21.380 --> 20:25.046
Beware of adults who eat cookies.
Particularly gingerbread men.

20:25.130 --> 20:26.588
They're pedophiles.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.838
Women love motorbikes.

20:29.921 --> 20:33.505
Take a helmet on your date to impress her.

20:33.588 --> 20:35.671
Or him. We're cool.

20:36.963 --> 20:40.171
Get cremated,
so you can fight the zombies.

20:42.213 --> 20:43.380
Questions?

20:45.130 --> 20:48.130
I'm all for giving them
a second chance, but...

20:49.171 --> 20:52.005
a kid who stabs his art teacher 13 times?

20:52.088 --> 20:53.380
That guy's here?

20:55.338 --> 20:56.921
He needs the most help.

21:00.005 --> 21:01.088
You win.

21:01.671 --> 21:04.088
You don't want to talk, fine.

21:05.505 --> 21:07.046
One more story, then I'll go.

21:11.380 --> 21:12.921
Not just any story.

21:15.671 --> 21:17.213
It's about a police investigation.

21:18.130 --> 21:20.255
And not just any police investigation.

21:20.588 --> 21:23.630
The case of the Napoléon Street Ripper.

21:24.296 --> 21:25.505
1726.

21:27.213 --> 21:29.671
Paris... The Latin Quarter.

21:30.505 --> 21:32.421
The Simonois mansion.

21:32.505 --> 21:33.421
It's cold.

21:34.296 --> 21:35.296
It's raining.

22:11.380 --> 22:14.130
The neighbor opens the door and finds...

22:14.588 --> 22:16.046
Madame de Simonois

22:16.130 --> 22:18.255
lying in a pool of blood.

22:21.130 --> 22:22.380
Who killed her?

22:23.755 --> 22:24.713
No idea?

22:24.796 --> 22:25.963
I'll tell you.

22:26.046 --> 22:27.380
The murderer...

22:28.005 --> 22:29.088
Excuse me.

22:29.546 --> 22:30.463
Hello?

22:31.088 --> 22:33.130
I can't talk right now.

22:36.921 --> 22:38.046
Who did it?

22:38.505 --> 22:39.338
The maid.

22:39.421 --> 22:42.130
Let people into your home
and they betray you.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.713
It's not the cook, so it's the maid.

22:45.796 --> 22:46.630
Bullshit.

22:46.713 --> 22:47.713
And her husband?

22:48.130 --> 22:50.213
They're the guilty ones 90% of the time.

22:50.296 --> 22:52.255
She's straight out of  CSI!

22:52.838 --> 22:54.338
My sister's a lawyer, that's all.

22:54.421 --> 22:55.296
She tells me stuff.

22:57.671 --> 22:59.463
Jimmy, we can't understand.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.838
The husband and maid were too far away.

23:01.921 --> 23:03.130
They weren't.

23:03.213 --> 23:05.630
-He was dancing with her.
-The coachman.

23:05.713 --> 23:07.338
The coachman, yeah!

23:07.421 --> 23:08.505
The maid was there.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.338
Fabrice, tell them.

23:10.421 --> 23:11.713
The coachman's armed.

23:11.796 --> 23:14.713
I know this kind of crazy shit.

23:14.796 --> 23:18.505
-That's crap! What are you talking about?
-Fabrice, tell them...

23:20.630 --> 23:23.130
-Bullshit.
-That's all crap!

23:25.421 --> 23:26.338
Whatever--

23:26.963 --> 23:28.130
Sorry.

23:31.130 --> 23:31.963
Where were we?

23:32.046 --> 23:34.671
I was telling you a story.
Shit, what was it?

23:35.963 --> 23:37.755
Never mind. Break?

23:37.838 --> 23:40.338
-No!
-Tell us, please!

23:40.421 --> 23:43.213
If I tell you, will you talk?

23:46.463 --> 23:47.880
-Yeah?
-OK.

23:47.963 --> 23:49.505
So who was it?

23:51.005 --> 23:52.838
-Don't know. I made it up.
-Fuck!

23:52.921 --> 23:55.380
-We got had.
-We fell for it!

23:55.463 --> 23:57.838
-I knew it.
-You forced me.

23:58.588 --> 24:01.505
Too many candidates.
We'll have to have lunch later.

24:04.630 --> 24:05.463
What's going on?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.630
-No idea.
-Did you see them?

24:09.296 --> 24:10.130
No.

24:14.005 --> 24:15.171
Is he doing OK?

24:15.671 --> 24:18.630
He's resourceful. Trust him.

25:22.005 --> 25:23.380
Come on, tell us.

25:23.463 --> 25:25.421
-Please.
-I showed you.

25:25.505 --> 25:27.546
-Come on, Wael.
-Please!

25:27.630 --> 25:29.296
He can't do it. He doesn't know how.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.338
Wael, Wael, Wael!

25:31.421 --> 25:34.171
OK, OK. Quickly then.

25:34.796 --> 25:36.255
Think of a tool and a color.

25:37.005 --> 25:37.963
Got it.

25:38.546 --> 25:39.546
Red hammer?

25:41.005 --> 25:42.796
Me. A blue spanner.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.713
What a surprise!

25:44.130 --> 25:45.671
No red hammer for you.

25:45.755 --> 25:47.755
-I think differently.
-That must be it.

25:48.213 --> 25:52.005
Most people think, "hammer, red."
So you already know what they're thinking.

25:52.088 --> 25:53.880
-Now guess stuff about us.
-Meaning?

25:53.963 --> 25:55.880
Personal stuff. Go round the group.

25:55.963 --> 25:57.338
But you'll be too wary now.

25:57.421 --> 25:59.088
Go on. Don't worry.

25:59.463 --> 26:01.171
I think...

26:01.588 --> 26:04.046
that Fabrice is an only child.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.213
That's in my file.

26:05.713 --> 26:06.921
Yes, and in your glass.

26:08.046 --> 26:09.963
You only poured yourself a drink, selfish.

26:12.713 --> 26:14.713
What about me?
How many brothers and sisters?

26:14.796 --> 26:16.963
Karim, I'm not the authorities.
I've no idea!

26:17.046 --> 26:20.171
I can only tell you the stuff
I've noticed while we're together.

26:20.255 --> 26:22.463
Shana, you admire Nadia.

26:23.046 --> 26:25.921
You always look at her for approval
when you speak.

26:26.005 --> 26:27.796
Our turn. I think you're 30.

26:28.671 --> 26:29.963
Bullshit. Forty.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.671
No. Thirty-five.

26:31.755 --> 26:35.630
At 30, you look and dress young.
And 40, you dress and look old.

26:35.713 --> 26:37.796
You look old, but you dress young.

26:38.130 --> 26:38.963
Thirty-five.

26:39.046 --> 26:40.588
And you're single.

26:40.671 --> 26:42.088
Why is that?

26:42.880 --> 26:46.671
No jewelry, no bracelets.
Girls give their boyfriends that stuff.

26:46.755 --> 26:48.671
Must be hard to be 35 and not married.

26:48.755 --> 26:51.005
So? My sister's the same.

26:51.088 --> 26:52.963
-Big surprise.
-What?

26:53.046 --> 26:54.296
It's her decision.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.713
Yeah, sure.

26:55.796 --> 26:56.880
Her career comes first.

26:57.713 --> 26:59.463
Yeah, but Wael doesn't have a career.

26:59.546 --> 27:00.963
What's his excuse?

27:01.046 --> 27:02.380
I don't have a career?

27:02.463 --> 27:03.463
You're here.

27:04.755 --> 27:08.213
So you've got no style, no girl,
and no career.

27:09.005 --> 27:10.171
It's sad.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.338
A pleasure to have lunch with you guys.

27:15.505 --> 27:17.963
You always helped troubled kids?

27:18.630 --> 27:19.755
No, it's new.

27:20.380 --> 27:21.755
They're not troubled.

27:22.630 --> 27:24.046
They just need more attention.

27:25.546 --> 27:28.213
-I wasn't being mean.
-I know. That would be unlike you.

27:29.713 --> 27:32.671
It was tough
getting this project approved.

27:33.255 --> 27:34.255
Why?

27:34.755 --> 27:38.963
I'm afraid many people think
bad students cost too much.

27:39.713 --> 27:41.921
-Right. Same for prisoners.
-Yes.

27:42.463 --> 27:45.505
They think there's no point
in helping others.

27:47.296 --> 27:48.255
Not married?

27:50.421 --> 27:51.255
I was.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.421
But she decided I lacked ambition.

27:55.505 --> 27:56.796
I don't agree.

28:01.505 --> 28:02.713
Anyhow...

28:04.046 --> 28:06.005
It's strange seeing you dressed like that.

28:07.088 --> 28:11.046
-Compared to earlier?
-No, compared to your old life.

28:14.296 --> 28:16.838
Tell me what happened.

28:17.255 --> 28:19.296
-And you, Shana?
-Same as Fabrice.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.588
Talking, absences, and fooling around.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.130
But not sexually.

28:24.171 --> 28:25.005
Not funny.

28:25.505 --> 28:28.088
-Nadia?
-I'm smarter than most.

28:28.505 --> 28:29.921
-Students?
-Humans.

28:31.130 --> 28:33.213
It's true. She's got an IQ of 140.

28:33.296 --> 28:34.296
Is that a lot?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.171
More than your whole family.

28:38.963 --> 28:41.255
Jimmy, stop talking. We don't understand.

28:41.338 --> 28:44.880
Karim, get him a pen.
Maybe some of the words are similar.

28:50.255 --> 28:51.963
But he doesn't know how to write.

28:52.296 --> 28:55.380
-What do you mean?
-What? Most gypsies can't.

28:55.463 --> 28:58.963
-Don't say gypsies, it's travelers.
-Exactly. They're travelers, not writers.

28:59.046 --> 29:04.171
Yeah, and so since he travels a lot,
not a lot of school, get it?

29:04.463 --> 29:06.088
Hey! Who are you?

29:06.171 --> 29:08.755
-Avoiding us?
-Shut your mouth!

29:09.130 --> 29:10.671
It's been three days now!

29:11.255 --> 29:13.296
Those are just my things.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.213
What's he doing here?

29:17.796 --> 29:18.880
He's just a street kid.

29:20.546 --> 29:22.505
He's blind, don't worry.

29:23.630 --> 29:26.005
You'll have the money tomorrow.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.338
Take what I have.

29:29.421 --> 29:31.421
Leave us alone!

29:32.380 --> 29:34.671
Kill her, too. No witnesses.

29:48.838 --> 29:51.338
Next time you try to play blind,

29:52.130 --> 29:53.296
remove your watch.

29:54.171 --> 29:56.338
Be on time.

29:56.421 --> 29:57.796
Follow the rules.

29:58.296 --> 30:01.630
We'll house you, feed you,
and educate you.

30:04.005 --> 30:06.671
We ask just one thing in return.

30:06.755 --> 30:08.880
Do your best.

30:10.088 --> 30:11.046
Is that OK?

30:17.713 --> 30:19.171
-Sister.
-Sir.

30:19.255 --> 30:20.255
Young man.

30:20.796 --> 30:22.713
He doesn't speak French.
He's a street kid.

30:22.796 --> 30:25.213
Oh, yes? He seems happy to be here.

30:26.046 --> 30:27.713
Go and wash now.

30:57.713 --> 31:00.088
If he can't talk, then he can't write!

31:00.171 --> 31:01.421
He understands everything.

31:01.505 --> 31:03.963
-He laughs when you guys do.
-He doesn't understand.

31:04.046 --> 31:05.755
Jimmy, why won't you talk?

31:08.130 --> 31:10.755
Me talk. Kids laugh.

31:15.588 --> 31:16.546
He can talk.

31:17.296 --> 31:18.796
Not well, but he can.

31:23.255 --> 31:24.630
-Bird.
-Yeah!

31:24.713 --> 31:25.755
Great, Jimmy!

31:25.838 --> 31:27.838
It's a cockatoo, but OK.

31:30.088 --> 31:30.921
Show me.

31:31.421 --> 31:32.463
That's an easy one.

31:32.880 --> 31:33.755
Fish.

31:33.838 --> 31:36.546
-Excellent!
-It's a shark, guys.

31:43.088 --> 31:43.921
Mushroom?

31:44.005 --> 31:45.546
-Ace!
-He's on fire.

31:45.630 --> 31:48.213
It's not, it's a jellyfish!
Why a mushroom when they're all animals?

31:48.296 --> 31:49.505
They're mushrooms.

31:49.588 --> 31:51.755
-Come on, seriously.
-Mushroom.

31:52.380 --> 31:54.463
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, fine.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.005
-Yes, OK.
-It looks like a mushroom.

31:57.088 --> 31:59.380
-Wael, isn't it time to go?
-Seriously?

31:59.463 --> 32:00.963
Yes, so it is. Bye then.

32:01.046 --> 32:03.630
-See you tomorrow.
-What are you talking about?

32:04.713 --> 32:05.671
Coming back tomorrow?

32:07.588 --> 32:10.838
See, it was cool today, but...

32:10.921 --> 32:13.005
But it's just the first day
that's compulsory.

32:13.380 --> 32:15.671
I don't think I'm coming back tomorrow.

32:15.755 --> 32:16.588
Why not?

32:17.130 --> 32:18.463
I want to be at home.

32:18.546 --> 32:21.046
No, come back. It's important...

32:22.630 --> 32:24.380
This stuff I'm teaching you...

32:24.463 --> 32:26.296
-Yeah, but...
-Punishment...

32:27.005 --> 32:28.338
Karim, you're coming back?

32:29.338 --> 32:30.421
I've got stuff to do.

32:31.380 --> 32:32.213
Shana?

32:33.546 --> 32:34.380
Same here.

32:35.505 --> 32:36.338
Ludo?

32:39.463 --> 32:43.421
-Fabrice, I won't even ask.
-Well, now I definitely won't be back.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.880
Yeah, right.
Jimmy, you're coming back, right?

32:45.963 --> 32:47.171
Yeah, you're coming back?

32:47.630 --> 32:49.171
You all should. This is important.

32:49.671 --> 32:50.713
And what about Victor?

32:50.796 --> 32:55.463
He's been working hard all day to try
and find the right person for you guys.

32:56.088 --> 32:58.588
And Victor hasn't got all that much time.

32:59.713 --> 33:00.630
He's dying.

33:01.255 --> 33:02.630
He hasn't got much time left.

33:06.505 --> 33:07.505
He's very ill.

33:10.130 --> 33:11.088
You're not coming?

33:15.171 --> 33:16.296
Seriously, come back.

33:16.963 --> 33:18.338
What does it matter to you?

33:18.421 --> 33:20.921
I'll be in the shit. Victor will press...

33:22.046 --> 33:26.130
Press me as to why I didn't convince
any of you to come back.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.630
It might...

33:31.005 --> 33:32.088
OK, how much?

33:32.255 --> 33:33.296
What?

33:33.380 --> 33:34.630
I'll pay you.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.338
Ten euros each and you come back.

33:36.713 --> 33:39.005
-OK?
-No, hold on a second.

33:39.088 --> 33:40.088
Come here...

33:42.088 --> 33:45.005
If he's offering ten euros,
he can afford a lot more.

33:45.088 --> 33:46.005
-Yeah.
-OK.

33:46.088 --> 33:48.005
-You know I can hear.
-Don't listen to him.

33:48.088 --> 33:50.088
Trust me. I can handle this.

33:50.171 --> 33:51.255
-OK.
-Go on.

33:53.796 --> 33:55.546
The problem is ten euros isn't enough.

33:55.963 --> 33:57.546
-We want 1,000.
-Ten.

33:57.630 --> 33:58.505
OK, ten.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.171
-You suck.
-He's too good.

34:01.255 --> 34:03.338
What if we take the ten
and we don't come back?

34:03.921 --> 34:05.546
You won't get the next 10 tomorrow.

34:05.630 --> 34:08.170
-You'll pay us every day?
-Have you given me a choice?

34:08.255 --> 34:11.588
No, we haven't. But tomorrow it won't be
ten euros. It will be 1,000.

34:11.670 --> 34:13.588
-Shut up.
-No way, you shut up too.

34:13.670 --> 34:15.545
Hang on. Will you be here tomorrow?

34:15.630 --> 34:16.713
No, I won't be.

34:18.588 --> 34:21.838
I'll stop by at the end of the day.
If you're here, you get your money.

34:22.170 --> 34:23.005
OK.

34:23.670 --> 34:24.838
-Deal?
-Yes.

34:24.920 --> 34:25.795
Happy?

34:25.880 --> 34:26.838
Right, get lost.

34:28.130 --> 34:29.420
-Thanks.
-Sure.

34:31.045 --> 34:32.130
Thanks.

34:36.255 --> 34:39.170
-Thank you. See you tomorrow.
-Now you speak in full sentences.

34:39.255 --> 34:40.170
It's a miracle!

34:41.420 --> 34:43.630
-Thanks, Wael.
-Yeah, yeah. See you.

34:45.088 --> 34:46.545
-Good idea.
-Yeah.

34:49.795 --> 34:50.630
Thanks.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.755
By the way, the others asked me

34:52.838 --> 34:54.963
to take theirs for them
and give it to them.

34:55.380 --> 34:56.213
What others?

34:56.588 --> 34:57.880
The guys from this morning.

34:57.963 --> 35:00.338
The one who did the push-ups,
the one you sent out--

35:00.421 --> 35:01.671
Get out. Go.

35:01.755 --> 35:02.588
Now.

35:03.380 --> 35:04.296
Make it snappy.

35:05.963 --> 35:06.921
What do you mean?

35:07.005 --> 35:08.713
Your disgusting lyrics.

35:08.796 --> 35:11.296
Pop music's gentler, more beautiful.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.630
-It is gentler.
-Thanks.

35:13.713 --> 35:17.588
-You should try it though.
-No, the words are so weird...

35:18.546 --> 35:19.463
You OK, Ludo?

35:20.088 --> 35:21.005
Yeah.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.421
You know him?

35:27.588 --> 35:28.963
He's my youth worker.

35:29.755 --> 35:31.130
Why don't you go over there?

35:32.421 --> 35:33.338
See you.

35:47.671 --> 35:49.046
I thought there were loads.

35:50.255 --> 35:54.005
Yeah, but some of them backed out
and the others weren't right for the job.

35:55.296 --> 35:57.921
I know, I don't understand it either.

35:58.255 --> 36:00.213
Don't worry, we'll find someone tomorrow.

36:00.630 --> 36:01.630
I hope so.

36:02.380 --> 36:03.880
You can do one more day, right?

36:05.088 --> 36:08.463
-So it's first come, first served.
-No, I want someone good, of course.

36:08.838 --> 36:09.838
But...

36:09.921 --> 36:12.046
-It means I have to go back.
-So?

36:12.130 --> 36:14.005
-It's a pain.
-You didn't enjoy yourself?

36:14.088 --> 36:16.171
No, I had a good day.

36:16.255 --> 36:17.671
They're funny. They're lively.

36:18.005 --> 36:19.088
Apart from Ludo.

36:19.171 --> 36:20.505
Something's not right there.

36:21.171 --> 36:23.088
He's suffering but...

36:23.671 --> 36:25.046
he doesn't give anything away.

36:25.796 --> 36:26.755
Sounds familiar.

36:29.338 --> 36:30.421
What's his problem?

36:32.255 --> 36:33.213
No idea.

36:33.296 --> 36:35.463
-So ask him.
-He won't tell me.

36:35.546 --> 36:37.046
You could try anyway.

36:37.755 --> 36:38.588
Sound familiar?

36:43.338 --> 36:44.296
What?

36:44.380 --> 36:45.671
No, nothing.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.546
They guessed I was single.

36:48.505 --> 36:50.088
I like them more and more.

36:51.005 --> 36:53.838
Did you also tell them you've got
every girl in France's number

36:53.921 --> 36:55.588
but you never call any of them?

36:55.671 --> 36:56.546
Forget it.

36:56.630 --> 37:00.046
Just one.
Just ask one of them out to dinner.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.130
How do I pick? I can't remember who's who.

37:02.213 --> 37:04.671
-Give it here, I'll pick one.
-No, stop. Let me be.

37:05.130 --> 37:07.963
In the olden days, parents helped choose
their daughter-in-law.

37:08.463 --> 37:09.463
"The olden days?"

37:09.921 --> 37:12.088
-Did you really say that?
-Shut it, I'm not old.

37:12.755 --> 37:13.963
Debatable...

37:15.338 --> 37:16.921
There. That's where it hurts.

37:18.505 --> 37:19.630
It's my tendons.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.963
I did too much running around
when I was young.

37:22.671 --> 37:24.005
You didn't have much choice.

37:24.796 --> 37:26.046
Those T. rexes run fast.

37:26.921 --> 37:28.171
T. rexes!

37:48.588 --> 37:49.671
What the...?

37:51.796 --> 37:55.213
He goes to the job center,
they ask him if he's got an appointment

37:55.296 --> 37:57.588
and he says,
with that really strong accent of his,

37:57.671 --> 37:59.630
"Yes, I've got
a phone interview at 9 a.m."

38:00.671 --> 38:02.963
That guy...

38:03.046 --> 38:05.796
His mom wanted to get him a job
at the bakery for the summer.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.255
She was like,
"Are you looking to fire extra staff?"

38:08.796 --> 38:10.546
She meant "hire," right?

38:10.630 --> 38:12.796
-Morning, Victor.
-Hi, kids.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.380
Did she really say "fire"?

38:14.463 --> 38:15.505
She's like that.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.588
What? Us Arabs?
We've invented tons of stuff.

38:21.671 --> 38:24.088
Like what? Benefits?
No wait, that was you guys.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.796
Math, moron.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.338
And loads of other stuff. What about you?

38:28.421 --> 38:31.213
The Kama Sutra. Yeah, take that!

38:31.296 --> 38:33.546
His folks must like doing it
in weird positions.

38:33.630 --> 38:35.171
Look at him!

38:36.713 --> 38:37.546
Bastard.

38:37.630 --> 38:38.713
-Hi.
-Why are you here?

38:39.046 --> 38:40.671
I thought there was a replacement.

38:40.755 --> 38:43.380
They haven't found one yet,
so I'm back again.

38:43.463 --> 38:44.588
What are we going to do?

38:44.671 --> 38:46.630
-I don't know. It's really early.
-It's not.

38:47.005 --> 38:48.171
What about a little nap?

38:48.255 --> 38:51.088
-No.
-Nah, this isn't kindergarten.

38:51.171 --> 38:52.171
You're such a weirdo.

38:52.255 --> 38:54.880
Why would we have a nap
when we just woke up?

38:54.963 --> 38:58.005
Maybe "nap" was the wrong word.
I should have said...

38:58.505 --> 38:59.505
meditation.

38:59.588 --> 39:02.046
-No way.
-We just woke up.

39:02.130 --> 39:04.505
Does he think
this is an old people's home?

39:04.588 --> 39:06.713
We don't do that stuff, weirdo.

39:06.796 --> 39:08.796
No way we're going to sleep.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.296
OK, OK, no meditation.
Fine. That's enough shouting, please.

39:12.380 --> 39:14.213
Let's play a game instead.

39:14.630 --> 39:15.796
Get into teams of two.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.171
If we're going in alphabetical order,
I'm first!

39:18.255 --> 39:20.005
Nah, alphabetical order sucks.

39:20.088 --> 39:21.588
-I disagree.
-Don't make me.

39:21.671 --> 39:22.796
OK, not alphabetical order.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.880
We'll do it in order
of who's least likely to go to prison.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.046
-What?
-What?

39:27.130 --> 39:28.505
That's discriminatory.

39:28.588 --> 39:30.796
Group one, Nadia and Shana.

39:31.921 --> 39:33.755
Group two, Fabrice and Jimmy.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.713
Group three, Ludo and Karim.

39:39.588 --> 39:40.796
Not going to sit together?

39:42.963 --> 39:45.546
Guys, I was joking.
You're not going to prison.

39:46.088 --> 39:49.088
That's not it. It's just that
Karim and Ludo can't be together.

39:49.171 --> 39:50.088
Why not?

39:50.171 --> 39:53.130
Their love is forbidden
and so we mustn't tempt them.

39:53.213 --> 39:54.796
No, it's because they don't speak.

39:54.880 --> 39:55.755
Why not?

39:55.838 --> 39:58.921
Because Ludo lives south
and Karim lives north.

39:59.421 --> 40:00.588
-So?
-They're at war.

40:01.588 --> 40:02.463
Didn't you know?

40:02.755 --> 40:03.796
But why?

40:04.505 --> 40:05.880
Honestly, no one can remember.

40:05.963 --> 40:08.171
The older guys kept attacking each other,

40:08.255 --> 40:09.755
then the younger ones copied.

40:09.838 --> 40:12.380
Then they kept it up,
even when they got older.

40:12.463 --> 40:15.171
So then the younger ones copied them.

40:15.255 --> 40:17.380
-And then they--
-Thank you, Fabrice.

40:17.463 --> 40:20.338
I think I see how it works.

40:20.421 --> 40:22.296
But you two care about that stuff?

40:22.380 --> 40:25.296
Yeah, they do. That's why they're here.
They fight all the time.

40:26.005 --> 40:28.130
And you don't talk to each other at all.

40:28.213 --> 40:30.546
If he talks to me,
I'll smash his face in again.

40:30.630 --> 40:32.380
Go on then, do it.

40:32.463 --> 40:34.421
Listen good, I'm going to fuck you up.

40:34.505 --> 40:35.671
Asshole!

40:37.838 --> 40:39.171
Stop! Stop it!

40:39.255 --> 40:41.296
Ludo! Sit down, man.

40:43.505 --> 40:45.755
-Just sit.
-You guys are a nightmare.

40:49.088 --> 40:51.088
-See, told you they were in love.
-Shut it.

40:51.463 --> 40:54.296
"I'll fuck you up. I'm gonna do you."

40:54.755 --> 40:55.796
Sounds like love to me.

41:03.380 --> 41:05.380
I'm Joseph. What's your name?

41:08.671 --> 41:10.880
-Do you speak French?
-No.

41:12.255 --> 41:13.755
What's your name?

41:13.838 --> 41:14.838
Wael.

41:16.546 --> 41:18.213
You're Christian then.

41:18.838 --> 41:19.755
No.

41:20.671 --> 41:22.505
-Muslim?
-Yes.

41:24.005 --> 41:26.088
I'm Christian.

41:26.171 --> 41:28.171
Muslims killed my family.

41:30.755 --> 41:33.796
Christians and Jews killed mine.

41:39.588 --> 41:41.630
I can teach you French if you want.

41:46.338 --> 41:50.130
Having said that,
heroin isn't Victor's biggest problem--

41:50.213 --> 41:51.296
it's gambling.

41:51.921 --> 41:53.005
It's been three--

41:53.588 --> 41:55.088
-Bye.
-Bye.

41:57.671 --> 42:00.546
It's been three months in a row
that he's told me he can't pay me.

42:01.046 --> 42:02.421
He gambles my salary.

42:02.505 --> 42:03.421
OK...

42:04.588 --> 42:06.880
-Monique!
-Let's make that four months.

42:07.213 --> 42:08.213
Yes?

42:13.046 --> 42:15.796
Could you tell the next person
to wait five minutes?

42:15.880 --> 42:17.338
I need to take a break.

42:17.755 --> 42:20.338
-Have you been through all the files?
-Yes, Master.

42:22.213 --> 42:23.296
Don't call me that.

42:23.380 --> 42:25.338
What? I'm not your slave?

42:25.421 --> 42:28.046
I do all your filing
and you don't even pay me.

42:29.546 --> 42:30.671
You tried to rob me.

42:31.630 --> 42:34.505
Hardly. It was just a bit of shopping.

42:34.588 --> 42:36.046
And only the cheap stuff.

42:36.130 --> 42:38.296
Own brand everything! It's pathetic!

42:38.380 --> 42:40.546
I'm doing my best, Monique. Money's tight.

42:40.630 --> 42:42.630
Have you ever tried those cookies you buy?

42:43.296 --> 42:44.380
No, the kids eat them.

42:44.713 --> 42:46.630
Monique, we're on a tight budget.

42:46.713 --> 42:48.713
It's not about money, it's about attitude.

42:48.796 --> 42:50.838
They need the best
so they can be the best.

42:51.546 --> 42:54.630
You think I want to fight for you?

42:54.713 --> 42:56.796
No, because you treat me like a secretary.

42:58.171 --> 43:00.171
-But you are my secretary.
-No, Victor.

43:00.255 --> 43:01.588
I'm a human being.

43:01.671 --> 43:03.713
You don't give me
any real responsibilities,

43:03.796 --> 43:06.171
so it's hard to give this partnership
everything I've got.

43:06.255 --> 43:07.713
What partnership?

43:07.796 --> 43:10.338
I just want you to file my paperwork!

43:10.421 --> 43:13.546
I want, I want, I want!
Stop with this alpha-male attitude.

43:14.171 --> 43:15.338
Know what I want?

43:15.421 --> 43:16.588
A review.

43:16.671 --> 43:18.630
And I don't mean a salary review,
tight-ass.

43:18.713 --> 43:20.713
No, I'm talking about a promotion.

43:20.796 --> 43:22.421
What are you talking about?

43:22.505 --> 43:24.046
There are only two of us, Monique.

43:24.130 --> 43:26.171
I want to be
on the recruitment team with you.

43:26.255 --> 43:27.796
I want to interview people.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.046
-You know you've got too much work!
-Yes, there is a lot to do.

43:32.463 --> 43:34.296
But what do you know about interviewing?

43:34.380 --> 43:36.630
Well, I've got one thing
you'll never have.

43:36.713 --> 43:37.921
Female intuition.

43:39.046 --> 43:40.005
Admit it.

43:40.921 --> 43:42.255
Admit that, at least.

43:43.505 --> 43:45.755
I can spot a crook a mile off.

43:48.921 --> 43:51.088
I'm sorry, Monique, I can't allow it.

43:53.671 --> 43:55.380
Fine. Don't worry about it.

43:56.213 --> 43:58.921
I'll get back to picking cotton.
Thank you, Mr. Victor, sir.

43:59.005 --> 44:01.046
Oh, come on, stop that.

44:01.130 --> 44:02.838
Please may I leave now, Oh Great One?

44:07.130 --> 44:09.546
Monique!

44:10.421 --> 44:11.588
OK, fine.

44:13.130 --> 44:14.963
Let's divide up the interviews.

44:33.838 --> 44:34.755
OK.

44:34.838 --> 44:36.546
You must be wondering why we're here.

44:39.421 --> 44:40.255
OK.

44:40.338 --> 44:43.338
We're here to work on something
very important. Communication.

44:44.005 --> 44:46.421
My dad say communication important.

44:46.505 --> 44:47.963
Exactly. Your dad is right.

44:48.046 --> 44:50.338
Communication is
the most important thing on Earth.

44:50.421 --> 44:53.671
It's not the smartest people who win,
it's the most resourceful ones.

44:53.755 --> 44:55.005
We know how to communicate.

44:55.088 --> 44:57.296
Yes, with your friends.
But with everyone else?

44:57.380 --> 44:59.005
-Suspended for?
-Being rude.

44:59.088 --> 45:00.755
Being rude. And why were you rude?

45:00.838 --> 45:02.588
-She started it.
-No, stop there.

45:02.671 --> 45:04.880
There's your problem.
She wasn't the one who was rude.

45:04.963 --> 45:07.755
-It's a communication problem.
-What do you mean?

45:08.171 --> 45:11.630
What you think,
what you want to say, what you say,

45:11.713 --> 45:14.130
what the other person hears,
and what they understand,

45:14.213 --> 45:15.880
five chances for miscommunication.

45:15.963 --> 45:16.838
You invented that?

45:17.421 --> 45:18.255
Yeah.

45:18.588 --> 45:20.921
-You sure? It sounds familiar--
-I came up with it.

45:21.088 --> 45:24.171
So the idea is to spend the day here,
but we need to eat at lunchtime

45:24.255 --> 45:26.630
so we need to find the money
to buy something to eat.

45:26.713 --> 45:28.171
And how are we going to do that?

45:29.963 --> 45:31.796
Observe, analyze,

45:32.213 --> 45:33.046
then act.

45:34.130 --> 45:35.338
And no one attacks anyone.

45:37.755 --> 45:39.421
Got it? Let the best man win.

45:39.505 --> 45:40.671
Woman.

45:48.755 --> 45:51.421
-So how was your weekend?
-Excuse me?

45:51.505 --> 45:53.755
-Mademoiselle, hello?
-Sorry, not now.

45:53.838 --> 45:55.088
Sorry, you were saying?

45:56.046 --> 45:57.505
-What's the point?
-Excuse me?

45:57.588 --> 45:58.921
Sorry, we're busy.

45:59.005 --> 46:02.380
-So you think that will help...
-Shit.

46:02.463 --> 46:04.338
Excuse me. How's it going?

46:04.421 --> 46:06.005
-Hi.
-What's your name?

46:06.088 --> 46:07.171
Linda.

46:07.255 --> 46:09.796
-You live round here?
-Not far.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.463
Right. Got five euros?

46:12.421 --> 46:13.630
Tramp.

46:14.171 --> 46:15.338
What about two?

46:15.421 --> 46:18.755
-Paris-Versailles?
-Yes, she races.

46:18.838 --> 46:21.171
I'll have to really think about it.

46:39.338 --> 46:40.296
Hello.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.630
What's the most popular game right now?

46:43.213 --> 46:45.338
Uncharted,  but I'm almost out.

47:03.380 --> 47:05.880
It's crazy, it makes me so mad...

47:08.505 --> 47:10.213
Always the same.

47:10.671 --> 47:11.671
Seriously?

47:11.755 --> 47:14.546
You see a girl in trouble
crying next to you and you walk off?

47:14.630 --> 47:17.755
Yeah, go ahead, look elsewhere!
Whatever you do, don't look at me!

47:30.130 --> 47:31.213
Hi there.

47:31.296 --> 47:32.380
Hey, we're both Arabs.

47:44.755 --> 47:46.338
Get out of here! Go on, move!

47:48.588 --> 47:49.588
Thank you.

47:51.088 --> 47:51.963
Hello.

47:52.046 --> 47:54.046
They've even got their kids working now!

47:54.130 --> 47:56.630
I'm standing in for my dad, he's not well.

47:56.713 --> 47:59.005
If I no sell everything, we thrown out.

48:04.630 --> 48:05.921
Excuse me, Madame...

48:09.296 --> 48:10.338
Are you OK?

48:12.255 --> 48:15.046
Listen, it's not your fault.
What does your bag look like?

48:15.130 --> 48:17.213
It's black. And brand new!

48:17.505 --> 48:20.588
-My folks are going to kill me.
-What's important is you're not hurt.

48:22.421 --> 48:23.421
Yeah.

48:23.505 --> 48:24.630
-Judo!
-What?

48:25.796 --> 48:29.046
My brother's judo money was in the bag!

48:29.755 --> 48:30.713
How much is judo?

48:32.380 --> 48:33.671
Thirty.

48:34.213 --> 48:35.505
I've only got 20.

48:36.088 --> 48:37.046
It's 20!

48:37.130 --> 48:40.255
It's 30 including the kimono, 20 without.

48:41.546 --> 48:42.505
Here you go then.

48:42.588 --> 48:44.130
-Serious?
-Yeah.

48:44.921 --> 48:45.755
Here.

48:45.838 --> 48:46.671
Thanks.

48:46.755 --> 48:48.880
-OK then. Bye.
-Bye...

48:49.588 --> 48:50.505
Sure?

48:51.171 --> 48:52.588
Sure.

48:52.671 --> 48:54.046
Are you really that tight?

48:55.046 --> 48:58.046
If I had a girlfriend as radiant
as this lovely lady,

48:58.671 --> 49:00.005
she'd get flowers every day.

49:00.088 --> 49:01.838
Easy when you're the one selling them.

49:12.171 --> 49:13.671
I wouldn't buy that.

49:15.088 --> 49:17.213
-It's got loads of bugs.
-How do you know?

49:17.296 --> 49:18.546
I helped design it.

49:20.171 --> 49:21.130
Go on, ask me anything.

49:21.588 --> 49:24.130
Where's the Lost City in  Uncharted 3?

49:25.421 --> 49:26.713
In the Rub Al-Khali Desert.

49:26.796 --> 49:27.630
Claudia Black.

49:27.713 --> 49:29.588
We got 96% on GameRankings.

49:29.671 --> 49:31.255
Artificial Intelligence.

49:31.338 --> 49:33.171
Up to ten in teams of five

49:33.255 --> 49:34.755
but only in multiplayer mode.

49:35.213 --> 49:36.963
It's true. She knows everything.

49:38.338 --> 49:39.630
Will there be a new version?

49:41.505 --> 49:44.213
-You want it before everyone else?
-Yes!

49:44.296 --> 49:46.671
OK, I think the winner's obvious. Nadia!

49:46.755 --> 49:48.088
I'm the best!

49:48.171 --> 49:50.755
-Don't be jealous, congratulate her.
-Who's the best here?

49:50.838 --> 49:52.088
You're amazing.

49:52.921 --> 49:55.088
We can also congratulate our two warriors

49:55.171 --> 49:57.130
on their massive failure.

49:57.213 --> 49:58.630
A total of zero euros!

49:59.463 --> 50:02.380
That's what happens when you stop thinking
and start fighting instead.

50:02.463 --> 50:04.713
You're lucky.
I'm teaching you real life here.

50:05.213 --> 50:07.630
Because I'm all about the details,
I don't miss a trick.

50:07.713 --> 50:09.921
I see everything, and I'm fast.

50:10.005 --> 50:11.296
Where's Jimmy?

50:11.380 --> 50:12.380
-Huh?
-Jimmy...

50:12.463 --> 50:13.713
-Jimmy?
-Jimmy...

50:14.213 --> 50:15.171
This way.

50:31.796 --> 50:32.921
Go Jimmy!

50:33.005 --> 50:34.130
Amazing!

50:36.130 --> 50:37.130
How good is he?

50:39.505 --> 50:40.963
You eat here every day?

50:42.171 --> 50:43.796
I normally eat in my office.

50:44.088 --> 50:45.130
How sad.

50:46.588 --> 50:48.463
More so than stealing people's shopping?

50:49.505 --> 50:52.421
Monique, I don't know what happened,
but your friend...

50:54.005 --> 50:56.171
I don't think he's a good example
for the kids.

50:57.755 --> 50:59.630
I'm sure you two would get on.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.171
You've got a lot in common.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.171
Who, me and Ludo?

51:04.005 --> 51:05.546
Please don't compare us.

51:05.630 --> 51:07.713
Seriously guys, what's this about?

51:08.630 --> 51:10.171
Don't worry, he knows.

51:10.255 --> 51:11.921
Yeah, but I don't. Explain it to me.

51:12.463 --> 51:14.713
They put my little brother in hospital.

51:14.796 --> 51:16.963
-That was me?
-Mates of yours, right?

51:17.046 --> 51:20.130
-Was I there personally?
-You saying you wouldn't have hit him?

51:20.213 --> 51:22.588
Come on, tell me the truth.
Show some balls.

51:23.171 --> 51:25.005
Well, yeah, I'd have hit him.

51:25.796 --> 51:27.671
-See?
-Only natural.

51:28.171 --> 51:30.213
You guys gassed Mathieu
in front of the bus.

51:30.296 --> 51:32.630
So? He came into our territory.

51:32.713 --> 51:35.463
-What's your problem?
-City Hall isn't your turf!

51:35.546 --> 51:37.546
City Hall's ours. Come on then. Get up!

51:37.880 --> 51:40.963
-Think you're funny, do you?
-What you gonna do, asshole?

51:41.046 --> 51:42.380
Guys, I've got a question.

51:42.463 --> 51:44.421
This north and south business...

51:45.463 --> 51:47.755
-It's all social housing, right?
-So what?

51:47.838 --> 51:49.796
So your parents
didn't choose to live there.

51:49.880 --> 51:51.171
It's where they were allocated.

51:51.255 --> 51:53.713
So either of you could have ended up
on the other's turf,

51:53.796 --> 51:55.963
or on the same turf
and been on the same side.

51:56.963 --> 51:58.796
Fight if you want to, I don't care.

51:59.463 --> 52:02.255
But you're essentially fighting
for the sake of a letterbox.

52:02.338 --> 52:03.755
We don't even have a letterbox.

52:04.296 --> 52:06.338
Leila, you start please.

52:06.421 --> 52:10.296
"A long time ago, our country
was called Gaul

52:10.380 --> 52:13.880
and the people who lived there
were called Gauls."

52:13.963 --> 52:14.796
Very good.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.255
Wael, now you.

52:16.338 --> 52:20.380
"The Gauls... like... to go hunting.

52:21.130 --> 52:22.630
They catch...

52:24.671 --> 52:26.963
wild boars and wolves."

52:27.671 --> 52:28.671
Well done.

52:29.171 --> 52:31.130
-Bashir, your turn.
-"It isn't..."

52:31.213 --> 52:32.921
-They're not my cousins.
-No?

52:33.005 --> 52:35.588
Course they're not his cousins!

52:35.671 --> 52:37.546
So this time it really is the last day.

52:37.630 --> 52:39.671
-I had a really good time.
-Us too, Wael.

52:39.755 --> 52:42.838
-Yeah, we hope it'll be you tomorrow.
-Yeah, or we'll protest again.

52:42.921 --> 52:44.963
No, no more of your protests.

52:45.713 --> 52:47.546
Well, look after yourselves and...

52:48.130 --> 52:48.963
You can go.

52:54.046 --> 52:56.296
You never give up. I don't believe it!

52:57.630 --> 52:58.796
Get lost now.

52:59.630 --> 53:00.463
Thanks, Wael.

53:01.046 --> 53:02.338
-Thanks!
-Yeah, whatever.

53:02.421 --> 53:03.255
Bye!

53:05.421 --> 53:06.463
Fucking hell.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.171
You're a hard guy to find.

53:28.171 --> 53:31.713
-Stop, you're hurting me!
-Think I've got time to run after you?

53:32.296 --> 53:34.130
You're the only one causing me problems!

53:34.213 --> 53:35.796
-Stop dodging me, got it?
-Yeah.

53:35.880 --> 53:36.921
-Got it?
-Yeah.

53:41.338 --> 53:42.380
How much did you make?

53:42.963 --> 53:45.046
Haven't sold anything.
I'm at school all day.

53:45.296 --> 53:47.755
Don't give me that, you little twat.
It's the holidays.

53:47.838 --> 53:49.046
It's compulsory!

53:49.130 --> 53:50.088
What about evenings?

53:50.921 --> 53:51.838
Do you sleep here?

53:52.880 --> 53:53.713
Do you?

53:53.796 --> 53:55.296
-No.
-Well then.

53:55.380 --> 53:57.838
When you get home, you work. Got it?

53:57.921 --> 53:59.088
Yeah.

53:59.171 --> 54:00.963
Tomorrow you'd better have
something for me.

54:02.838 --> 54:04.213
I don't want to do it anymore.

54:07.088 --> 54:08.088
I don't want to.

54:11.296 --> 54:12.130
Oh, yeah?

54:15.421 --> 54:16.380
OK.

54:18.380 --> 54:19.463
Let's stop.

54:20.213 --> 54:21.588
Is that what you want?

54:22.213 --> 54:23.630
Yeah? OK.

54:24.796 --> 54:28.421
You stop dealing for me
and I'll stop running after you.

54:29.921 --> 54:31.130
I'll ring social services.

54:31.213 --> 54:33.505
Single mom with no job and four kids?

54:33.588 --> 54:35.713
-They'll be interested.
-No! Don't, Frank!

54:35.796 --> 54:39.255
They'll separate you all, of course.
No one's going to take all four of you.

54:39.338 --> 54:40.421
Please don't say anything.

54:43.921 --> 54:45.088
Here, this is all I have.

54:46.755 --> 54:48.463
What's this? You did work after all?

54:48.546 --> 54:51.255
No, the guy in charge,
he gives us ten euros a day.

54:51.963 --> 54:52.796
What for?

54:52.880 --> 54:55.213
I don't know. Nothing.
To make sure we come.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.255
Get out of here.

55:30.005 --> 55:33.380
-Don't you have anything else?
-I'll get something nicer tomorrow.

55:34.796 --> 55:35.880
Amen!

55:36.880 --> 55:40.838
OK, so I've got two potentials
and they can both start tomorrow.

55:42.630 --> 55:43.838
I haven't got any.

55:44.546 --> 55:45.671
Not one?

55:47.463 --> 55:48.755
Monique, what do you mean?

55:54.005 --> 55:55.421
Oh, no, you didn't...

55:55.505 --> 55:57.213
Wael is the best you're going to get.

55:57.671 --> 55:59.213
You can't do this to me.

56:00.005 --> 56:02.338
Talk with the kids
and then you can decide.

56:02.963 --> 56:05.421
He's a criminal, Monique! And so are you!

56:06.046 --> 56:08.005
That boy has been through a lot!

56:08.838 --> 56:11.338
OK, he's getting his revenge,
but he's got a good heart.

56:11.838 --> 56:13.755
And I pray every day

56:13.838 --> 56:16.838
that he'll find something he likes
and stop all this nonsense.

56:16.921 --> 56:20.255
But yes, I'd rather be a criminal
and watch him than let him get put away!

56:22.171 --> 56:23.255
Talk to the kids.

56:26.713 --> 56:27.921
So you're sure?

56:28.005 --> 56:29.130
Yes, 100%.

56:29.921 --> 56:31.296
Good, that's great.

56:33.380 --> 56:34.255
Who is it?

56:35.213 --> 56:37.921
It's a girl.
She's got a lot of experience.

56:40.088 --> 56:40.963
Good.

56:43.588 --> 56:45.588
So she's got experience, has she?

56:46.463 --> 56:47.546
Oh, yes.

56:48.171 --> 56:50.130
She's been working with kids
her whole life.

56:51.588 --> 56:54.255
So it's not all just routine to her?

56:54.338 --> 56:56.380
I mean, it's good to have
a fresh perspective,

56:56.463 --> 56:57.838
not to be immune to it all.

56:58.546 --> 57:00.213
No, don't you worry.

57:01.046 --> 57:05.463
No, she seems perfect.
She's punctual, energetic, firm...

57:05.546 --> 57:07.921
Who cares about being firm?

57:08.005 --> 57:10.046
-That's not what...
-No, it's just...

57:10.880 --> 57:11.838
Nothing.

57:11.921 --> 57:12.838
-What?
-No, nothing.

57:13.463 --> 57:15.713
-Tell me.
-No, I...

57:15.796 --> 57:17.671
-I'm probably wrong.
-Tell me.

57:19.171 --> 57:20.005
I...

57:20.088 --> 57:23.296
Maybe I'm wrong, but when....

57:24.046 --> 57:26.505
When I said goodbye to her, she smelt...

57:27.880 --> 57:29.380
a little bit of alcohol.

57:29.755 --> 57:31.380
-Are you joking?
-Just a little bit.

57:31.463 --> 57:34.005
Either she smelt of alcohol or she didn't.

57:34.671 --> 57:38.130
I'm sorry, but no, you can't hire her.

57:38.213 --> 57:39.838
I won't give her the kids.

57:39.921 --> 57:40.963
No way.

57:41.046 --> 57:43.005
That would be dangerous.

57:43.713 --> 57:45.796
I'll come tomorrow and stay for the week.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.921
And if you want to hire her after that,
you can,

57:49.005 --> 57:50.963
but she can work when she's sober.

57:51.046 --> 57:52.505
-Are you crazy?
-Sure?

57:52.588 --> 57:53.838
Not like I have a choice.

57:53.921 --> 57:55.713
Don't think I'm happy about it, though.

57:58.671 --> 58:00.255
I'll talk to Victor then.

58:03.505 --> 58:06.296
Talking of Victor, do you think...?

58:09.713 --> 58:10.713
What?

58:10.796 --> 58:12.296
-What?
-I don't know!

58:13.505 --> 58:14.630
No, but...

58:14.713 --> 58:16.171
-What?
-You're blushing.

58:16.671 --> 58:18.546
-I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

58:19.796 --> 58:22.296
-I just want to ask you--
-Go ahead.

58:22.380 --> 58:24.921
-Go ahead and what?
-Come on. Go ahead.

58:26.546 --> 58:27.796
I know you, don't forget.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.546
Victor's a good guy.

58:31.671 --> 58:33.546
It will be good for you
not to be alone anymore.

58:34.171 --> 58:35.630
How do you know he's on his own?

58:36.755 --> 58:38.213
Aren't we all?

58:39.963 --> 58:41.630
Who's good at animal cries?

58:42.296 --> 58:44.130
-Not me.
-I am.

58:44.213 --> 58:46.213
-Which animal?
-Cat.

58:46.296 --> 58:47.338
Make a cat sound then.

59:01.963 --> 59:03.880
Don't forget the tongue. You too.

59:11.088 --> 59:12.296
You need to eat.

59:20.338 --> 59:22.005
I'll leave the soup here.

59:22.796 --> 59:24.255
Eat if you're hungry.

59:25.671 --> 59:26.880
Not asleep yet?

59:26.963 --> 59:28.630
Been awake all this time?

59:28.713 --> 59:30.338
Time to sleep now.

59:31.255 --> 59:32.296
You too.

01:00:23.213 --> 01:00:24.505
-Hey, Ludo.
-What?

01:00:25.005 --> 01:00:26.421
We're not pals, OK, but...

01:00:26.921 --> 01:00:28.755
If I see you in a fight...

01:00:29.463 --> 01:00:30.880
I wouldn't hit you, OK?

01:00:31.338 --> 01:00:32.171
Why not?

01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:34.546
-Hi.
-Yes! Hey!

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:36.213
-All good?
-Yeah.

01:00:36.296 --> 01:00:39.005
-We were worried you weren't coming.
-Yeah, right.

01:00:40.213 --> 01:00:41.338
-Let's go.
-Where?

01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:43.255
Aren't we going into town like yesterday?

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.213
Karim.

01:00:56.255 --> 01:00:57.088
Ludo.

01:01:02.713 --> 01:01:04.630
-Karim.
-You serious?

01:01:08.213 --> 01:01:09.130
Fuck's sake...

01:01:09.213 --> 01:01:10.213
Last one...

01:01:13.213 --> 01:01:14.880
-Karim.
-Fuck, come on.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.546
You really piss me off.

01:01:17.505 --> 01:01:18.713
I love you, Jack.

01:01:18.796 --> 01:01:21.255
Don't say that, Rose.
You're going to live.

01:01:21.338 --> 01:01:22.546
I'm so cold.

01:01:23.088 --> 01:01:24.671
-I love you, Nadia.
-Rose.

01:01:24.755 --> 01:01:26.880
Yeah, Rose.
Listen, we're going to make it.

01:01:26.963 --> 01:01:29.296
-You'll die an old woman.
-My body's gone numb.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.671
Right now,
promise me you're going to live.

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:34.088
-Never give up.
-I will never give up.

01:01:34.796 --> 01:01:36.171
I want to grow old with you.

01:01:36.255 --> 01:01:37.963
I want to bear your children.

01:01:38.588 --> 01:01:39.963
You know I love you.

01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:41.005
And I will never...

01:01:41.588 --> 01:01:43.796
Come on, that's enough of this shit!

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.088
But it was so good!

01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:47.046
It was crap. I'm not a girl!

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:48.213
No, you're not a girl.

01:01:48.296 --> 01:01:50.713
-You're playing a part.
-No way. I'm not doing it.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.838
-Hello.
-Aren't you supposed to be in court?

01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:56.296
Yes, I'm on my way.
You left your keys at home.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.755
No, I've got my keys. They're Yasmina's.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.296
My mistake.

01:02:02.963 --> 01:02:05.171
-OK, bye.
-Bye, see you later.

01:02:05.963 --> 01:02:07.338
That's Nadia's sister?

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:11.630
Sarah?

01:02:11.713 --> 01:02:13.296
-You're Nadia's sister?
-Yeah.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.755
-Incredible!
-Yeah.

01:02:15.713 --> 01:02:18.171
Thanks for not blowing my cover
in there with the kids.

01:02:18.755 --> 01:02:19.630
Your cover?

01:02:20.046 --> 01:02:23.088
You know, that I know Beyoncé
and I work in showbiz.

01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:25.546
I saw you at the airport
when you first spotted me,

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:28.880
and when I saw you again, I knew
you must have run to catch up with me,

01:02:28.963 --> 01:02:30.296
just so you could talk to me.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.088
-So, forget showbiz.
-Wait. Why did you give me your number?

01:02:33.713 --> 01:02:35.713
I don't know. I was curious.

01:02:36.296 --> 01:02:37.755
And resourceful guys are cute.

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:41.588
And then my sister mentioned a certain
weird Wael, so I thought I'd check.

01:02:43.838 --> 01:02:45.380
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:49.130
Hang on a sec. I can make it up to you.

01:02:51.588 --> 01:02:55.130
OK, I know. Let me do something
that I've never done before.

01:02:55.213 --> 01:02:57.546
-Have dinner with me.
-You've never asked a girl out?

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:59.838
-No, never.
-Listen, I've got to go.

01:02:59.921 --> 01:03:02.588
Hang on, wait. OK.
I can think of something better.

01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:04.838
Dinner at mine
with the kids' parents on Friday.

01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:06.463
I'd really like you to come.

01:03:06.546 --> 01:03:07.713
Not interested.

01:03:09.713 --> 01:03:11.005
What about Nadia's future?

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:14.171
I'll text you the address!

01:03:17.796 --> 01:03:18.630
What?

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:20.755
When you say "sister"

01:03:21.588 --> 01:03:23.963
it's because she's like a sister to you?

01:03:24.046 --> 01:03:25.130
No, she is my sister.

01:03:25.755 --> 01:03:26.796
But...

01:03:27.546 --> 01:03:29.546
-Have you got the same parents?
-Of course.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.421
-Both of them?
-Yes.

01:03:32.755 --> 01:03:34.463
No one got remarried, or...?

01:03:34.546 --> 01:03:35.505
No.

01:03:35.588 --> 01:03:37.005
No foster family?

01:03:37.088 --> 01:03:38.088
No.

01:03:38.171 --> 01:03:39.296
No one was adopted?

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.255
No, no, and no again!

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.088
Show us a photo of your parents.

01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:45.713
What's your problem, weirdo?

01:03:46.213 --> 01:03:47.546
Come on, just tell her.

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:49.588
You don't look anything like each other.

01:03:49.671 --> 01:03:52.380
Don't tell her, though,
because then she'll get all jealous.

01:04:06.755 --> 01:04:07.796
But do you like it?

01:04:08.046 --> 01:04:10.588
Yeah, I mean, to begin with,
it's good money.

01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:12.546
But it's getting riskier now.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:14.005
Two of my mates got caught.

01:04:16.213 --> 01:04:17.338
What if you rat him out?

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:20.130
He's a cop. Who's going to believe me?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.380
That's fucked up.

01:04:28.463 --> 01:04:32.755
...let it go, eeny, meeny, miny--

01:04:33.838 --> 01:04:36.880
Hi, kids. Hi, Wael.
Can I borrow them for moment?

01:04:36.963 --> 01:04:37.921
Right now?

01:04:38.005 --> 01:04:39.630
I'm pairing them up for oral class.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.296
And by that I mean
speaking English, Fabrice.

01:04:50.005 --> 01:04:53.630
And so, what have you learned
over the last few days?

01:04:53.713 --> 01:04:56.630
-Jimmy's learned to read and write.
-And how's that going?

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:03.255
And do you like him?

01:05:03.338 --> 01:05:04.588
-Yeah.
-Sure.

01:05:04.671 --> 01:05:06.880
And you come back every day because...

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.838
We want to go back to school.

01:05:10.588 --> 01:05:11.546
Yeah.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.171
We want...

01:05:14.963 --> 01:05:17.713
We think our punishment was justified,

01:05:17.796 --> 01:05:21.380
and we'd like to continue our studies
in a calm and serious manner.

01:05:24.463 --> 01:05:26.796
Do you want him to stay
until the end of the course?

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.421
Yes.

01:05:28.796 --> 01:05:30.588
-I could replace--
-No!

01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:34.088
OK, thanks, kids.

01:05:34.171 --> 01:05:35.963
-You can go back in.
-Thanks.

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.671
I'LL SEND THE ADDRESS LATER

01:05:46.755 --> 01:05:49.838
I'M STUCK IN THE STUDIO WITH RIHANNA

01:05:51.421 --> 01:05:53.046
WHO'S THIS?

01:05:57.088 --> 01:05:58.505
WAEL...

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:05.130
NO, WHO IS RIHANNA?

01:06:08.005 --> 01:06:10.546
-Don't mention the money, otherwise...
-It's not even us.

01:06:10.755 --> 01:06:12.880
Yeah, but Victor will get in trouble,

01:06:12.963 --> 01:06:14.171
and I like Victor.

01:06:14.255 --> 01:06:15.921
-So blow him then.
-What did you say?

01:06:16.213 --> 01:06:18.255
-It's just an expression.
-No, say it again.

01:06:18.338 --> 01:06:19.838
Come on, he's kidding.

01:06:20.755 --> 01:06:22.046
Well, it's not funny.

01:06:30.338 --> 01:06:32.130
-The ground.
-The ground.

01:06:32.713 --> 01:06:33.630
Joseph!

01:06:36.171 --> 01:06:37.171
Joseph!

01:06:38.296 --> 01:06:39.296
Come here.

01:07:09.005 --> 01:07:10.213
And what do I do?

01:07:12.213 --> 01:07:13.630
Try something.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.005
The guy's got moves!

01:07:18.963 --> 01:07:20.213
We should organize a gig.

01:07:20.796 --> 01:07:23.421
It's a big step, Wael. Are you sure?

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:26.963
It feels right.

01:07:27.963 --> 01:07:29.421
I don't know what to say to her.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.005
You'll work it out.

01:07:31.921 --> 01:07:33.505
I'm not good at talking to people.

01:07:35.338 --> 01:07:36.505
You'll learn.

01:07:37.713 --> 01:07:39.046
And who's going to teach me?

01:07:42.838 --> 01:07:47.130
LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.880
She's going to feel very lonely.

01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:06.921
Yes. I've made some bread
to take over to her.

01:08:07.713 --> 01:08:08.546
This is good.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:12.171
Good idea.

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:14.130
Daddy.

01:08:14.505 --> 01:08:17.005
It's my fault I can't find them.
Don't buy me new ones.

01:08:18.337 --> 01:08:19.962
What on earth do you mean?

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.046
I don't deserve a new pair.

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:25.712
We all make mistakes.

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:28.046
-That's true.
-He's right.

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:30.796
I don't think I deserve new glasses.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.796
Poor little girl.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.921
Yes, I know.

01:08:37.587 --> 01:08:38.796
But I'm here.

01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:41.712
But what happens when you're gone?

01:08:42.337 --> 01:08:44.005
I'll take you with me.

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.921
I'll never leave without you.

01:09:01.462 --> 01:09:03.171
Shana, I've been thinking of you.

01:09:04.005 --> 01:09:05.421
I baked you some bread.

01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:09.337
Thanks.

01:09:10.296 --> 01:09:11.255
I think.

01:09:12.755 --> 01:09:15.296
You know,
if you lose your glasses one day...

01:09:17.087 --> 01:09:18.462
you mustn't blame yourself.

01:09:18.546 --> 01:09:19.837
You mustn't think...

01:09:21.005 --> 01:09:24.212
that you should have kept them on
or that you don't deserve a new pair.

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:25.880
But I don't wear glasses.

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.212
Because actually...

01:09:27.755 --> 01:09:28.796
you're the victim.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.505
You're not to blame.

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:32.255
Everyone loses their glasses.

01:09:32.962 --> 01:09:34.212
Wael, I don't wear glasses.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.837
Don't think that it's your fault.

01:09:38.087 --> 01:09:40.046
That would be silly.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:42.255
Everyone makes mistakes.

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:45.462
OK.

01:09:47.505 --> 01:09:48.587
And...

01:09:48.671 --> 01:09:51.296
if anything like that happens to you,
you can talk to me.

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.962
You can trust me.

01:09:53.046 --> 01:09:55.921
You need to know
that I'll never leave without you.

01:09:56.005 --> 01:09:57.671
I'll take you with me.

01:09:58.171 --> 01:10:00.088
What do you mean, "without me"?

01:10:00.755 --> 01:10:02.838
Are you going to kidnap
and hold me to ransom?

01:10:02.921 --> 01:10:04.088
Is it because I'm Jewish?

01:10:04.171 --> 01:10:06.713
-What are you talking about?
-No, what are you talking about?

01:10:06.796 --> 01:10:09.088
I saw how you reacted
to Fabrice's joke yesterday.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.755
Yeah, well, it wasn't funny, that's all.

01:10:12.838 --> 01:10:15.463
If there's something going on,
you need to talk to someone.

01:10:15.713 --> 01:10:19.588
No, don't worry. Nothing's happened.
It's just I don't like that kind of joke.

01:10:20.546 --> 01:10:21.380
Sure?

01:10:21.963 --> 01:10:22.796
Yeah.

01:10:24.088 --> 01:10:26.421
Good. I must have misunderstood.

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:29.463
It's just it happened to someone I know,
so I was a bit...

01:10:29.546 --> 01:10:31.463
No, don't worry. I'm OK.

01:10:31.546 --> 01:10:33.255
But you know someone who's not?

01:10:36.671 --> 01:10:37.505
Who's that?

01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:40.755
It's Ludo's youth worker, I think.

01:10:42.963 --> 01:10:45.880
-Wael, can I go find the others?
-Sure, go ahead.

01:10:45.963 --> 01:10:47.130
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.380
Hi.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.255
-Hi.
-You're Ludo's youth worker, right?

01:10:55.255 --> 01:10:56.213
Did he tell you that?

01:10:56.296 --> 01:10:59.005
No, he's not big on talking.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.963
-Yeah.
-So are you?

01:11:02.005 --> 01:11:04.088
-Yeah.
-Is he like this at home, too?

01:11:04.755 --> 01:11:05.796
I can't talk about it.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.630
I'm not being nosy.
It's just because I work with him, too.

01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:11.005
So...

01:11:11.088 --> 01:11:12.463
I can't talk about it.

01:11:12.546 --> 01:11:14.546
Do you want to see him? I can let you in.

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:17.171
-No, don't worry.
-I don't mind, I can give you the code.

01:11:17.588 --> 01:11:19.380
You the guy who pays them to come back?

01:11:20.546 --> 01:11:21.588
Right, OK.

01:11:21.671 --> 01:11:23.921
So he told you. Doesn't look very pro.

01:11:26.171 --> 01:11:28.171
If you can keep a secret,
it's not real money.

01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:29.755
What?

01:11:29.838 --> 01:11:31.838
It's just to get them
to come back every day.

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:33.255
No, how is it not real money?

01:11:33.338 --> 01:11:34.296
Forged notes.

01:11:34.755 --> 01:11:36.046
They look pretty real to me.

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.796
No. I can't pay out 60 euros
a day to a group of kids.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.213
What are you saying?

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.380
I know a guy who sells 10-euro notes
for 1 euro,

01:11:43.838 --> 01:11:45.963
20 euros for 2.50 euros,
50 for 5, and so on.

01:11:46.255 --> 01:11:48.213
We pay him a tenth of their value. Get it?

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.213
OK, have you got 10 euros on you?

01:12:02.255 --> 01:12:03.088
Seriously?

01:12:03.171 --> 01:12:05.546
It would be great
if this could stay between us.

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:06.838
It's not a gift.

01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:10.505
I want to know about Ludo,
so I can help him, OK?

01:12:12.505 --> 01:12:14.130
-No problem.
-My name's Wael.

01:12:14.588 --> 01:12:16.338
-Nice to meet you, Wael.
-Great.

01:12:16.421 --> 01:12:17.880
Don't tell the kids, OK?

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.130
-Don't worry.
-Or they won't come back.

01:12:20.213 --> 01:12:21.713
-Talk soon?
-Definitely.

01:12:26.921 --> 01:12:28.921
I can't read that. What does it say?

01:12:29.005 --> 01:12:30.005
-Where?
-There.

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.755
It says, "Ham and eggs".

01:12:35.713 --> 01:12:36.921
No, it doesn't.

01:12:37.005 --> 01:12:39.046
Yeah, it does, "AM N X". "Ham and eggs".

01:12:40.546 --> 01:12:41.963
When you need to ask quickly.

01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:45.130
"Quick, AM N X."

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:47.880
Right.

01:12:48.463 --> 01:12:51.171
Did you know
that direct and indirect objects

01:12:51.255 --> 01:12:53.671
don't follow the same rules?

01:12:53.755 --> 01:12:54.588
Look here...

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:56.838
-What are you doing, Fabrice?
-Sorry, I slipped.

01:12:56.921 --> 01:12:58.921
Wael! Victor needs to get
this furniture changed.

01:12:59.005 --> 01:12:59.963
It's dangerous, man!

01:13:00.046 --> 01:13:01.755
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, fine, but...

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.463
OK, so you were saying...

01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:06.380
Why can't I write it like that?

01:13:06.463 --> 01:13:08.713
Because you want ham and eggs,
not confused looks.

01:13:10.838 --> 01:13:12.046
Ludo, don't do that again.

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:15.088
Use the tape to stay within the area.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:22.755
Then take the beige blusher...

01:13:26.713 --> 01:13:27.546
What are you doing?

01:13:28.963 --> 01:13:29.921
What's that?

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.671
No, nothing. I'm...

01:13:33.088 --> 01:13:35.296
-Coming for lunch?
-No, sorry, we can't.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.630
Victor's got a meeting and I...
I have filing to do.

01:13:38.713 --> 01:13:40.171
Monique, are you ready?

01:13:40.255 --> 01:13:42.338
We mustn't be late,
I've booked the best table.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.796
For the meeting at City Hall.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.505
-City Hall?
-If they start without us...

01:14:00.671 --> 01:14:02.296
WARRIORS

01:14:04.338 --> 01:14:05.796
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:14:17.713 --> 01:14:18.963
BABYSITTING...

01:14:19.046 --> 01:14:22.046
THINGS ARE HARD FOR BRAD
AND ANGELINA SINCE THEIR DIVORCE,

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.880
SO I'M LOOKING AFTER THEIR KIDS FOR THEM

01:14:34.796 --> 01:14:37.880
Wael, can I talk to you
about something real quick?

01:14:37.963 --> 01:14:38.880
Sure.

01:14:39.796 --> 01:14:43.088
Can we talk a bit more
about communication and all that stuff?

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:47.421
See, I've got this friend,
and some people don't like her

01:14:47.505 --> 01:14:49.380
because she's smarter than they are.

01:14:49.463 --> 01:14:51.338
So, she gets mad.

01:14:51.421 --> 01:14:54.296
It's not her fault,
it's just that everyone else is a moron.

01:14:54.671 --> 01:14:56.588
People can be real morons.

01:14:59.005 --> 01:15:00.088
Who is she?

01:15:00.171 --> 01:15:02.130
Someone at school.

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.296
And what's her name?

01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:06.630
Her name's Inès.

01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:08.463
Where does she live?

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.921
She lives in Créteil.

01:15:11.005 --> 01:15:12.421
Créteil, right.

01:15:12.796 --> 01:15:14.380
And what does she do in Créteil?

01:15:15.213 --> 01:15:16.421
She's a dentist.

01:15:16.796 --> 01:15:19.046
You've got a school friend
who's a dentist?

01:15:21.296 --> 01:15:23.255
I mean, she's not really a dentist.

01:15:23.338 --> 01:15:24.421
No kidding.

01:15:25.213 --> 01:15:27.088
Can I ask you to listen for two minutes?

01:15:27.171 --> 01:15:30.588
So we've helped Jimmy
with his communication problems.

01:15:30.671 --> 01:15:31.880
Now it's Nadia's turn.

01:15:31.963 --> 01:15:34.296
I don't have communication problems.

01:15:34.505 --> 01:15:36.130
List Nadia's qualities for me.

01:15:36.213 --> 01:15:37.296
Smart.

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.171
-Remembers everything.
-Fantastic.

01:15:39.255 --> 01:15:41.380
See? No communication problems.

01:15:41.463 --> 01:15:42.421
And now, her faults.

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.421
-She never lets anything go.
-She's a show-off.

01:15:48.213 --> 01:15:51.255
It's not that I don't let things go,
it's just when I'm right, I'm right.

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:52.338
You'd be the same.

01:15:59.921 --> 01:16:01.755
Nadia, what do you see?

01:16:01.838 --> 01:16:02.838
A duck.

01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:05.213
-OK. Everyone else?
-Duck.

01:16:05.296 --> 01:16:07.213
-Everyone sees a duck?
-I do, too.

01:16:07.838 --> 01:16:09.421
-Who sees something else?
-I do.

01:16:09.505 --> 01:16:11.088
I see a rabbit.

01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:12.255
A rabbit?

01:16:12.338 --> 01:16:14.171
Yeah, look, it's a rabbit.

01:16:14.255 --> 01:16:15.880
-Yeah, it's a rabbit.
-Look again.

01:16:15.963 --> 01:16:17.796
-Definitely a duck.
-Ludo, what about you?

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.130
A rabbit.

01:16:19.213 --> 01:16:21.880
See your duck's beak?

01:16:21.963 --> 01:16:24.088
Those are his ears.

01:16:24.171 --> 01:16:26.671
-Exactly.
-Oh, yeah, I see.

01:16:27.171 --> 01:16:28.880
So it's a duck-rabbit.

01:16:29.255 --> 01:16:30.838
No, it's not a duck-rabbit.

01:16:30.921 --> 01:16:33.755
Some people see a duck,
others see a rabbit.

01:16:33.838 --> 01:16:35.796
We see different things,
but who's right, Nadia?

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.963
It's about interpretation, not facts.

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:43.671
That's beautiful. Did you just make it up?

01:16:44.255 --> 01:16:45.755
Not right this minute.

01:16:45.838 --> 01:16:46.838
I made it up...

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:49.921
roughly a week, ten days ago.

01:16:50.588 --> 01:16:52.213
Sure it's not Nietzsche?

01:16:52.671 --> 01:16:55.296
Well, if there are guys out there
copying me...

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:56.546
Ten days is a long time.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:58.546
What does it mean exactly?

01:16:58.963 --> 01:17:02.213
It means we can disagree,
but still both be right.

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.463
Exactly. Right, time to go.

01:17:05.546 --> 01:17:06.713
Already?

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:08.130
Come and rob me blind then.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.338
Thanks for everything, Wael.

01:17:21.046 --> 01:17:23.171
-Thanks, Wael.
-Bye, Jimmy.

01:17:23.255 --> 01:17:25.130
-See you tomorrow, Wael.
-Bye, Shana.

01:17:26.088 --> 01:17:26.963
Thanks.

01:17:30.296 --> 01:17:31.630
Fabrice, are you coming?

01:17:43.046 --> 01:17:44.255
It was a long time ago...

01:17:48.046 --> 01:17:49.546
He never tried again.

01:17:52.796 --> 01:17:54.171
I try not to think about it,

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:56.296
but I can't help it.

01:18:02.463 --> 01:18:03.588
It was just me.

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:07.421
He didn't touch my sisters.

01:18:10.463 --> 01:18:11.463
Sometimes...

01:18:13.338 --> 01:18:14.880
when I was little, he...

01:18:16.796 --> 01:18:18.838
It will wreck my family if I say anything.

01:18:19.255 --> 01:18:21.005
-No.
-They'll hate me.

01:18:21.088 --> 01:18:22.213
No one will hate you.

01:18:22.838 --> 01:18:24.213
I don't want to press charges.

01:18:25.755 --> 01:18:26.796
Talk with...

01:18:27.755 --> 01:18:29.088
someone you can trust.

01:18:30.171 --> 01:18:31.046
My mom?

01:18:34.046 --> 01:18:35.671
What if she doesn't believe me?

01:18:35.755 --> 01:18:36.838
She will.

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.296
What if she doesn't do anything?

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.588
Then I will.

01:18:43.838 --> 01:18:44.921
Your friend...

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.921
The one it happened to.

01:18:49.755 --> 01:18:51.088
Did he talk to someone?

01:18:51.171 --> 01:18:52.171
Joseph?

01:18:54.546 --> 01:18:55.546
Joseph?

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.130
SHANA
SHE BELIEVED ME

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.838
What are you doing?
Hurry, the makeup guy's coming!

01:20:20.505 --> 01:20:22.713
-Seriously?
-What?

01:20:33.838 --> 01:20:35.255
Monique, I'm way too hot.

01:20:35.338 --> 01:20:37.838
Concentrate on the footwork.
We need to win.

01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:38.880
Why?

01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:41.005
I thought we'd given up conning people.

01:20:41.088 --> 01:20:42.880
This is different.
We're not robbing anyone!

01:20:49.505 --> 01:20:52.796
Save your applause until later.
Next up, couple number 21!

01:22:19.296 --> 01:22:22.463
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give it up for our winners,

01:22:22.546 --> 01:22:24.171
couple number 21,

01:22:24.255 --> 01:22:26.338
Monique and Fernand!

01:22:26.421 --> 01:22:28.338
Fernand? What kind of name is that?

01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:30.755
-I won't be--
-Smile.

01:22:30.838 --> 01:22:31.838
Thank you.

01:22:44.005 --> 01:22:45.046
Any post for me?

01:22:45.505 --> 01:22:48.630
Yes, here. From the education authorities.

01:22:49.713 --> 01:22:50.880
A bill.

01:22:50.963 --> 01:22:52.005
Another bill.

01:22:52.671 --> 01:22:54.380
Local council.

01:22:54.463 --> 01:22:56.463
-The FEA.
-What's that?

01:22:58.046 --> 01:23:00.463
French Enterprise Agency.

01:23:02.921 --> 01:23:04.505
Never heard of it. Let me see.

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:07.421
And I think this last one is personal.

01:23:12.255 --> 01:23:16.421
"We are very honored to congratulate you
on the swift promotion of your employees.

01:23:19.713 --> 01:23:24.130
"Indeed, the ascent
of your former secretary to...

01:23:26.796 --> 01:23:28.171
the very top of your business

01:23:28.255 --> 01:23:32.546
has led us to name you
as our Business of the Month,

01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.630
and we would therefore like to offer you

01:23:35.713 --> 01:23:38.255
a week's holiday in Réunion
for two people."

01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:48.921
These are real tickets!

01:23:49.005 --> 01:23:50.171
That's wonderful.

01:23:51.046 --> 01:23:52.213
I'm so pleased for you.

01:23:53.046 --> 01:23:55.005
This is unbelievable!

01:23:55.088 --> 01:23:56.671
Do you know who you're going to take?

01:23:58.505 --> 01:23:59.338
Of course.

01:24:01.171 --> 01:24:02.338
I'll give her a ring now.

01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:25.838
Did you call for me?

01:24:26.755 --> 01:24:27.713
Come in.

01:24:29.671 --> 01:24:31.130
We're having a meeting.

01:24:31.213 --> 01:24:32.088
What?

01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:34.296
We meet every Friday
to discuss how the week went.

01:24:35.796 --> 01:24:36.630
So, Wael.

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:39.213
My dear Wael.

01:24:39.546 --> 01:24:41.546
I don't know how you did it,
but well done.

01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:45.046
Full attendance all week!
I take my hat off to you.

01:24:45.921 --> 01:24:49.338
The hardest part is giving them
a reason to keep coming back.

01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:51.088
Thank you.

01:24:51.755 --> 01:24:55.338
How do you feel about the kids?
Because, well, they love you!

01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:57.713
It's a great experience.

01:24:57.796 --> 01:24:59.921
I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I do.

01:25:00.005 --> 01:25:02.630
Well, you should make a career out of it.

01:25:02.713 --> 01:25:05.380
You'd have no trouble getting qualified.

01:25:06.421 --> 01:25:08.088
-Really?
-Really.

01:25:08.338 --> 01:25:09.713
But no nicking shopping carts.

01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:12.213
If you can't change, tell me right now.

01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:14.296
Think about it.

01:25:15.421 --> 01:25:16.546
What else?

01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:18.963
Do you like the cookies?

01:25:19.046 --> 01:25:20.130
Delicious.

01:25:21.005 --> 01:25:23.505
Yeah, really good.
Honestly, Victor, I'm touched you--

01:25:25.838 --> 01:25:28.171
See! You can't even tell the difference!

01:25:28.255 --> 01:25:31.171
Not another word about own-brand cookies!

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.713
Right, I've got work to do.

01:25:36.046 --> 01:25:37.588
And you. Think it over.

01:25:52.796 --> 01:25:53.630
Hey!

01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:56.088
Wael.

01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:57.880
-All good?
-Yeah.

01:25:57.963 --> 01:25:59.296
Here's the little guy's file.

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:00.921
For you.

01:26:01.338 --> 01:26:03.546
Everything's in there.
School, health, home life.

01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:06.380
-Wow, you don't kid around.
-Isn't it what you wanted?

01:26:06.755 --> 01:26:08.713
Yeah, but I wasn't expecting...

01:26:10.588 --> 01:26:12.588
I got a cop friend to check you out.

01:26:13.963 --> 01:26:14.963
What?

01:26:15.296 --> 01:26:16.921
-I don't get it.
-Yes, you do.

01:26:19.338 --> 01:26:21.296
We're not going to be
youth workers forever.

01:26:22.005 --> 01:26:24.546
I need you to get me an introduction
with your supplier.

01:26:26.005 --> 01:26:27.255
That can't happen.

01:26:27.338 --> 01:26:30.755
Frankly, you want to stay away.
It won't lead anywhere good.

01:26:30.838 --> 01:26:33.713
It's OK, I get it. It's your thing.
Keep it to yourself.

01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:37.796
But you did tell me

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:40.463
that each note cost a tenth of its value.

01:26:40.546 --> 01:26:41.546
Let me past, please.

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:46.088
So if you give him 40,000 euros...

01:26:48.713 --> 01:26:50.546
he'll give you 400,000 fake ones.

01:26:50.921 --> 01:26:51.921
Right?

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:56.255
I'll give you 50 grand of the 400,000.

01:26:56.755 --> 01:26:57.630
Your commission.

01:26:58.921 --> 01:27:02.255
-50,000 euros.
-Yes. And that's just for starters.

01:27:02.338 --> 01:27:04.088
You and I are going to make megabucks.

01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:06.046
When can you get it?

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:11.171
-I have to go.
-I don't think you heard me.

01:27:11.463 --> 01:27:12.755
Fifty thousand euros.

01:27:13.838 --> 01:27:15.588
How long's she been looking after you?

01:27:16.671 --> 01:27:18.463
And all you do is screw up.

01:27:20.213 --> 01:27:21.046
Wael.

01:27:23.088 --> 01:27:24.880
You ought to return the favor, right?

01:27:25.838 --> 01:27:27.088
-Come on.
-Just once.

01:27:28.213 --> 01:27:30.171
-Just once, OK?
-Fine.

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:34.380
-When?
-How do I know this isn't a trap?

01:27:35.171 --> 01:27:37.046
That your cop friend won't be joining us.

01:27:37.130 --> 01:27:39.130
You watch too many movies.

01:27:39.213 --> 01:27:42.505
There's no mic, the notes aren't tagged.
This is straight up.

01:27:42.963 --> 01:27:43.880
OK?

01:27:45.255 --> 01:27:48.421
Remember, you were the one who told me.
I didn't ask you for anything.

01:27:59.255 --> 01:28:00.421
Unbelievable.

01:28:01.046 --> 01:28:02.005
I don't know.

01:28:02.338 --> 01:28:04.046
Really, if I get ten numbers a day,

01:28:04.921 --> 01:28:06.963
I was bound to run into one of them.

01:28:07.046 --> 01:28:09.255
Yes, but it's crazy
that she's Nadia's sister.

01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:11.630
Yes. Small world.

01:28:12.505 --> 01:28:13.630
Or God is great.

01:28:14.421 --> 01:28:15.380
God is great.

01:28:17.963 --> 01:28:19.255
You may not believe anymore,

01:28:19.796 --> 01:28:21.505
but look at His signs.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:24.963
Victor, the kids, and now Sarah.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.171
You think they're signs,
I call them coincidences.

01:28:32.005 --> 01:28:34.838
You know I always wanted to have a child
but I couldn't.

01:28:34.921 --> 01:28:35.796
I know.

01:28:36.671 --> 01:28:39.005
So I left everything behind and found God.

01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:41.921
He was the one who sent me there.

01:28:44.171 --> 01:28:46.005
I always thought it was...

01:28:46.505 --> 01:28:48.130
to help all those poor kids.

01:28:49.463 --> 01:28:50.963
But it was to find my child.

01:28:57.838 --> 01:28:58.921
You know,

01:28:59.796 --> 01:29:02.796
you can run, but you'll always wind up
where you're supposed to be.

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:04.463
Yeah.

01:29:07.255 --> 01:29:10.130
So when He shows us the way,
it's a shame not to follow.

01:29:11.296 --> 01:29:12.630
Why are you telling me this?

01:29:13.296 --> 01:29:14.630
What's in your bag?

01:29:22.296 --> 01:29:23.755
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

01:29:24.588 --> 01:29:26.088
-All good?
-Yes, and you?

01:29:26.171 --> 01:29:28.130
Yeah, I'm...

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:29.463
glad you came.

01:29:31.005 --> 01:29:31.838
Hey!

01:29:33.171 --> 01:29:34.505
You're here, too, Nadia.

01:29:34.588 --> 01:29:36.880
-Well, this is about her.
-Yeah.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.838
What's all this?

01:29:42.505 --> 01:29:44.255
No, that's nothing.

01:29:44.338 --> 01:29:46.421
It's for tonight's meeting.

01:29:46.796 --> 01:29:48.963
I thought it was more original.

01:29:49.255 --> 01:29:50.921
Fifteen of us eating off two plates?

01:29:51.505 --> 01:29:52.463
Precisely.

01:29:52.546 --> 01:29:55.963
The kids have one plate
and the adults get the other.

01:29:56.046 --> 01:29:57.088
To encourage...

01:29:58.130 --> 01:30:00.046
team spirit.

01:30:00.130 --> 01:30:01.296
Bit weird, right?

01:30:01.921 --> 01:30:02.921
It's inventive.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.005
Weird that they're all late, right?

01:30:34.546 --> 01:30:35.755
Aren't you worried at all?

01:30:36.671 --> 01:30:38.005
Yeah, aren't you worried?

01:30:38.713 --> 01:30:42.380
Actually, I think they may not have
received my group text.

01:30:43.088 --> 01:30:44.296
I texted...

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.546
everyone.

01:30:46.255 --> 01:30:49.880
And your sister's the only one
I saw in person, so I invited her--

01:30:49.963 --> 01:30:51.880
That must be it.

01:30:53.046 --> 01:30:54.171
Good job I came then.

01:30:54.588 --> 01:30:56.713
Otherwise it would have been just you two!

01:30:57.671 --> 01:31:00.005
That would have been awkward for you both.

01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:01.380
Quite. Thank you, Nadia.

01:31:02.338 --> 01:31:03.171
Thanks for coming.

01:31:05.005 --> 01:31:07.671
So cute! You made chicken-shaped napkins!

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:09.755
No, those are swans.

01:31:09.838 --> 01:31:11.338
No, you make swans like this.

01:31:20.630 --> 01:31:21.463
That's a swan.

01:31:27.213 --> 01:31:28.046
I hate her.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:36.171
So, yeah. He lisped for a month,
but he didn't make fun of my name again.

01:31:37.171 --> 01:31:38.671
Wael's a lovely name.

01:31:38.963 --> 01:31:40.130
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:31:40.213 --> 01:31:41.505
I would call my son that.

01:31:42.505 --> 01:31:44.046
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

01:31:44.921 --> 01:31:46.505
I couldn't call my daughter Sarah.

01:31:47.213 --> 01:31:48.088
Why not?

01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.088
It's the same name as her mother.

01:31:52.796 --> 01:31:54.130
-What?
-You're crazy.

01:31:57.505 --> 01:31:59.963
So, what do you really do?

01:32:00.546 --> 01:32:01.796
Lawyers...

01:32:03.046 --> 01:32:05.296
-You never let anything go.
-Come on, tell me.

01:32:08.838 --> 01:32:09.838
I get by.

01:32:12.213 --> 01:32:13.588
OK, no more lies.

01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:15.838
So?

01:32:15.921 --> 01:32:16.880
So...

01:32:17.838 --> 01:32:19.046
I run a few scams.

01:32:26.005 --> 01:32:27.046
That's it?

01:32:27.921 --> 01:32:29.213
You don't want to hear more?

01:32:30.171 --> 01:32:31.296
I've read your file.

01:32:31.755 --> 01:32:33.505
I just wanted to see if you'd lie.

01:32:36.213 --> 01:32:38.171
And why did you become a lawyer?

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:42.380
Thanks to a pretty special teacher.

01:32:42.463 --> 01:32:44.713
She got me into law
and I've never wanted to stop.

01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:49.046
Sometimes people inspire you
without you even noticing.

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.171
I don't know.

01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:57.880
Thanks for your help.

01:33:03.505 --> 01:33:05.255
I know Joseph was your friend.

01:33:06.255 --> 01:33:08.088
God is watching over him now.

01:33:08.171 --> 01:33:10.838
He should have watched over him here.

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:17.713
The Lord didn't do
those horrible things to him.

01:33:18.796 --> 01:33:21.921
No, but He did nothing to stop them.

01:33:22.005 --> 01:33:25.963
Like He did nothing for my family.

01:33:26.046 --> 01:33:29.380
He wants me to be alone and unhappy.

01:33:29.463 --> 01:33:32.005
You won't be alone or unhappy.

01:33:33.088 --> 01:33:36.963
You'll grow up and have lots of friends.

01:33:37.046 --> 01:33:39.171
And a wife and a family.

01:33:39.255 --> 01:33:41.005
People will love you.

01:33:41.088 --> 01:33:44.546
I won't let them. It hurts when they go.

01:33:45.755 --> 01:33:46.963
Look at me.

01:33:47.046 --> 01:33:48.546
Look at me carefully.

01:33:49.838 --> 01:33:50.838
I will...

01:33:51.463 --> 01:33:54.630
I will love you all your life.

01:33:55.171 --> 01:33:56.296
Every day.

01:33:57.421 --> 01:33:58.755
Whatever happens.

01:33:59.630 --> 01:34:00.755
I promise you.

01:34:15.296 --> 01:34:18.505
So? Was it worth my night away?

01:34:18.963 --> 01:34:19.796
You tell me.

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:20.796
What do you mean?

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:23.296
-You stayed with Victor, right?
-Let's not talk about it.

01:34:24.088 --> 01:34:26.255
He took me out to dinner,
bought me flowers,

01:34:26.338 --> 01:34:28.796
gave up his bed for me,
and slept on the sofa.

01:34:29.421 --> 01:34:30.796
Then he made breakfast.

01:34:31.296 --> 01:34:32.463
Sounds awful.

01:34:32.546 --> 01:34:33.588
That's not it.

01:34:33.671 --> 01:34:37.463
I don't want people thinking
I got promoted because he's sweet on me.

01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:38.588
Promoted?

01:34:38.671 --> 01:34:42.338
You know I was made HR Manager
within two days, right?

01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:45.463
Next, I'll be Assistant Director.

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:46.588
People will talk.

01:34:57.213 --> 01:34:59.088
I don't say this enough, Monique, but...

01:35:00.088 --> 01:35:01.880
everything you've done for me...

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:05.880
I remember everything.

01:35:05.963 --> 01:35:07.421
Are you off to war or something?

01:35:08.963 --> 01:35:10.046
I hope not.

01:39:00.505 --> 01:39:03.171
-Do you get the irony of this?
-Of what?

01:39:04.046 --> 01:39:06.338
I might be old,
but you're the one in a wheelchair.

01:39:07.213 --> 01:39:08.463
You're not that old.

01:39:10.755 --> 01:39:13.296
-How did you have time to do all this?
-What do you mean?

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:15.213
Well, you called me like 20 times a day.

01:39:16.630 --> 01:39:19.005
-You wish I hadn't gone.
-Of course I don't.

01:39:19.088 --> 01:39:21.963
I promise, if Sarah hadn't insisted
then I would have stayed.

01:39:22.588 --> 01:39:24.671
-You know that, right?
-I know, I know.

01:39:25.546 --> 01:39:26.713
This is the best one.

01:39:27.505 --> 01:39:28.755
Just for you.

01:39:30.505 --> 01:39:31.796
Did he really shout?

01:39:32.755 --> 01:39:35.088
"I'm the king of the world!"

01:39:35.505 --> 01:39:36.546
Finished, Shana?

01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:40.380
Shana, you've been at it for ten minutes.

01:39:41.171 --> 01:39:42.796
Can you pass me the ribbon, please?

01:39:44.713 --> 01:39:46.046
Surprise!

01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:47.963
Surprise!

01:39:48.046 --> 01:39:49.671
-How's it going?
-Good.

01:39:49.755 --> 01:39:51.088
-You OK?
-Hi.

01:39:51.171 --> 01:39:53.380
-Hi, Wael.
-Got the crap beaten out of you?

01:39:53.671 --> 01:39:55.005
It was a close match.

01:39:55.338 --> 01:39:56.171
Liar!

01:39:56.255 --> 01:39:58.380
Seriously. Head-butted him in the knee.

01:39:58.463 --> 01:40:00.921
Got him in the elbow.
Believe me, he must be in pain.

01:40:03.171 --> 01:40:04.713
Good to see you, Wael.

01:40:05.546 --> 01:40:06.380
King of the world.

01:40:07.963 --> 01:40:09.380
-No.
-What?

01:40:09.463 --> 01:40:10.338
I know nothing.

01:40:12.255 --> 01:40:14.046
-Couldn't keep quiet?
-What's going on?

01:40:14.130 --> 01:40:15.088
Nothing.

01:40:15.921 --> 01:40:16.963
Wael,

01:40:17.046 --> 01:40:18.380
this is from the kids.

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.880
Here. I wrote it.

01:40:21.963 --> 01:40:25.255
"From all of uz. Thank you
for wot you dun for uz."

01:40:25.338 --> 01:40:28.296
Yeah, you can tell Jimmy wrote it!

01:40:28.838 --> 01:40:29.671
Thank you.

01:40:33.546 --> 01:40:35.505
THE LITTLE BOOK OF QUOTES

01:40:36.088 --> 01:40:38.005
It's full of people who stole your quotes.

01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:42.255
I've got something for you too.

01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:46.130
APPLICATION FORM

01:40:46.213 --> 01:40:47.546
Are you serious?

01:40:54.421 --> 01:40:57.421
THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO HELP OTHERS,
ASSHOLE!

01:41:03.005 --> 01:41:05.213
