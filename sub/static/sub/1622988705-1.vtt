00:36.756 --> 00:39.590
What makes
a person extraordinary?

00:41.548 --> 00:43.881
Everyone wants to be normal.

00:43.965 --> 00:45.840
But no one wants to be ordinary.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.299
And what is normal?

00:49.382 --> 00:52.382
We all see the pretty
pictures on our feeds.

00:52.465 --> 00:57.756
Normal party, normal family,
normal adorable little girl.

00:57.840 --> 01:02.715
But, there's always
more behind the facade.

01:02.798 --> 01:06.132
Most of the time
Lindy seems quite normal.

01:06.215 --> 01:11.132
But buried deep in
her DNA she has a gift.

01:11.215 --> 01:15.756
Some call it a condition,
or even worse, a disorder,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.756
that's just
waiting to be activated

01:18.840 --> 01:22.382
and it makes
her anything but normal.

01:23.673 --> 01:26.465
When people do bad things,

01:26.548 --> 01:29.007
Lindy cannot control herself.

01:29.090 --> 01:33.215
Maybe if she'd had
that normal loving family,

01:33.299 --> 01:36.007
she could have
been extraordinary.

01:36.090 --> 01:42.424
But, just like Lindy, mommy
and daddy had their own demons.

01:42.506 --> 01:45.756
Whether it was that mummy's
pills made her so sleepy,

01:45.840 --> 01:50.424
or that daddy got so
angry when he drank too much,

01:50.506 --> 01:53.215
we'll never know.

01:53.299 --> 01:58.673
But whatever it was, Lindy
never got the love she needed.

01:58.756 --> 02:02.382
Instead, she got
angrier and angrier,

02:02.465 --> 02:06.132
and her disorder
got worse and worse.

02:08.299 --> 02:12.048
And then her parents
got her diagnosis.

02:12.132 --> 02:16.548
The doctors called it
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

02:20.215 --> 02:23.756
She could not
live safely in the world,

02:23.840 --> 02:28.257
and no one would
be safe around her.

02:28.340 --> 02:32.257
So to live at all,
she would have to live alone,

02:32.340 --> 02:36.382
isolated from others
till the cure could be found.

02:36.465 --> 02:40.465
The huge amount of cortisol
coursing through Lindy's body,

02:40.548 --> 02:44.382
made her faster than
normal, stronger than normal,

02:44.465 --> 02:47.465
which made her
incredibly attractive

02:47.548 --> 02:49.965
to certain interested parties.

02:53.007 --> 02:57.506
But her condition also
made her extremely volatile

03:02.798 --> 03:06.798
and far, far
angrier than normal.

03:08.465 --> 03:13.340
Lindy had a hair trigger.
Once provoked, she would snap.

03:15.382 --> 03:19.007
Until she could gain control,
she was no use to anyone.

03:19.090 --> 03:22.756
Her life as
a human lab rat began.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.715
The results were mixed.

03:29.048 --> 03:31.299
So they thought,
maybe the military

03:31.382 --> 03:32.715
would give her the structure

03:32.798 --> 03:35.631
to channel her unique gifts.

03:39.007 --> 03:40.257
Or maybe not.

03:57.257 --> 03:59.048
All right, stop!

03:59.132 --> 04:00.340
Get off!

04:03.465 --> 04:04.798
Get off him, now!

04:04.881 --> 04:07.090
Stop means, stop!

04:09.090 --> 04:12.090
They were
so kind and supportive.

04:12.173 --> 04:14.506
It's a wonder it didn't help.

04:14.590 --> 04:19.423
Of course, all these
cures only made it worse.

04:19.505 --> 04:22.673
You would think they'd
learn not to piss her off.

04:26.007 --> 04:29.840
It was looking more and more
like they would just lock her up

04:29.923 --> 04:31.631
and throw away the key.

04:32.631 --> 04:36.715
Lindy would be alone, forever.

04:36.798 --> 04:42.548
And then a breakthrough,
a chance to be normal.

04:42.631 --> 04:46.382
The treatment was
brutal, barbaric, outrageous

04:46.465 --> 04:49.673
and surprisingly effective.

06:39.382 --> 06:40.382
Hey!

06:41.923 --> 06:43.441
Yeah, actually I'm
not staying so... um,

06:43.465 --> 06:45.007
I thought a date might be fun,

06:45.090 --> 06:46.400
but I'm not in
the right head-space,

06:46.424 --> 06:47.881
so I didn't want to bail,

06:47.965 --> 06:49.899
without saying something,
'cause I'm not a total bitch.

06:49.923 --> 06:50.923
- Okay.
- So...

06:51.007 --> 06:52.299
You know it's funny? Uh...

06:52.382 --> 06:54.024
This isn't even
the worst date I've ever had.

06:54.048 --> 06:56.340
Yeah. I feel bad...
I'm sorry about that...

06:56.424 --> 06:57.424
Herpes!

06:57.506 --> 06:59.881
Yeah, herpes,
chlamydia and, um, warts.

06:59.965 --> 07:01.257
Uh...

07:01.340 --> 07:02.424
Okay.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.923
This girl just kept listing off,

07:04.007 --> 07:06.631
all the sexually transmitted
infections she had. It was...

07:06.715 --> 07:08.215
it was unexpected.

07:09.506 --> 07:11.673
Yeah, I mean, warts
generally are, aren't they?

07:11.756 --> 07:14.007
You don't have
a disaster date story?

07:14.090 --> 07:18.048
Uh, me? No,
I don't date that much. No.

07:18.132 --> 07:21.424
Oh, is that 'cause you're always
leaving before they start?

07:24.923 --> 07:27.191
No, you're doing quite well.
I normally don't even come in.

07:27.215 --> 07:28.631
Oh, why not?

07:28.715 --> 07:30.215
Uh...

07:31.048 --> 07:32.048
I hate people.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.840
Like who?

07:34.923 --> 07:38.424
I don't know. People who...
who talk with their mouth full

07:38.506 --> 07:42.881
and... and, uh, people who, who
chew too loudly, people who hum.

07:42.965 --> 07:45.299
Um, men who wear
jeans with flip-flops...

07:45.382 --> 07:46.899
I can't stand
people who walk too slow.

07:46.923 --> 07:47.923
Yeah. Exactly.

07:48.007 --> 07:49.382
Or tell you to have a nice day.

07:49.465 --> 07:51.358
Yeah! Like, fuck off
I might not want a nice day.

07:51.382 --> 07:53.048
Or, uh, people
that talk in elevators.

07:53.132 --> 07:54.590
Yeah, that's bad.

07:54.673 --> 07:56.191
Yeah, aside from people
that fart in elevators.

07:56.215 --> 07:57.923
That's... That's worse.

07:58.007 --> 07:59.173
Do you fart in elevators?

08:00.299 --> 08:01.299
Do you fart?

08:01.382 --> 08:03.382
No, I'm from
England, we don't...

08:03.465 --> 08:04.673
Are we ready to order?

08:04.756 --> 08:07.590
I'm actually not
staying, so I don't know.

08:07.673 --> 08:09.551
Sir, I'm afraid if
she won't be dining with you,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.090
we will need the table back.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.923
Okay.

08:13.007 --> 08:14.340
Now.

08:15.881 --> 08:16.881
Uh...

08:17.923 --> 08:19.173
Okay, um...

08:19.257 --> 08:21.424
Okay, I'll just, um...

08:21.506 --> 08:23.382
I'll just have the chicken
really quickly then.

08:23.465 --> 08:24.923
Uh...

08:25.007 --> 08:26.881
Fish please,
without the pine nuts.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.424
We don't do substitutions.

08:28.506 --> 08:30.673
Oh, no. I'm... I'm...
I'm allergic, so...

08:31.590 --> 08:32.673
It's restaurant policy.

08:33.631 --> 08:37.424
Uh, okay. The pasta, please.

08:37.506 --> 08:38.881
There is a walnut sauce.

08:38.965 --> 08:40.923
Uh,
how about the pork chop?

08:41.006 --> 08:42.340
Pistachio crust.

08:42.424 --> 08:44.483
Fuck me. Perhaps you can suggest
something that might work.

08:44.506 --> 08:45.816
Please don't
take that tone with me.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.923
- No, I'm not.
- Sir. You are.

08:48.007 --> 08:50.085
You're making it impossible
for me to impress my date

08:50.132 --> 08:52.007
and it's embarrassing.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.506
How about the chicken?

08:58.257 --> 08:59.257
Sure.

08:59.340 --> 09:00.798
Thank you.

09:00.881 --> 09:03.007
Let me know if
you need anything else.

09:03.090 --> 09:04.090
Thank you.

09:05.631 --> 09:07.899
You know, if you were planning
to stab her with that knife,

09:07.923 --> 09:09.090
it'd be totally cool with me.

09:12.257 --> 09:13.881
Look, I have to pee actually.

09:13.965 --> 09:15.548
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

09:21.048 --> 09:23.299
I know, right?

09:23.382 --> 09:25.840
A guy just told
his wife he is having an affair.

09:25.923 --> 09:30.132
Some old woman's
dentures got stuck in her steak.

09:30.215 --> 09:33.382
But hold up, you should see
the first date I just served.

09:33.465 --> 09:34.798
I gave the guy some attitude

09:34.881 --> 09:37.382
and he practically
cried into his napkin.

09:37.465 --> 09:40.173
Yeah. And his date just sat
there and watched him squirm.

09:40.257 --> 09:43.548
Oh, my God.
It was so embarrassing.

09:43.631 --> 09:45.691
I mean, screwing with the
customers isn't fun anymore.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.590
It's like my own
private freak show.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.257
The guy had, like,

09:50.340 --> 09:53.465
allergies to pretty much
everything on the menu.

09:53.548 --> 09:55.631
It was pathetic.

09:56.715 --> 09:58.798
I know.

09:58.881 --> 10:00.424
Total losers.

10:00.506 --> 10:01.840
Anyway...

10:11.590 --> 10:12.840
She'll call you back.

10:18.548 --> 10:19.548
Fuck!

11:25.840 --> 11:28.798
Oh! Ain't you
a fine little piece...

11:28.881 --> 11:29.965
Ow!

11:30.965 --> 11:31.965
Fuck!

11:39.173 --> 11:40.299
It's not working.

11:41.506 --> 11:43.215
Okay. Fix it!

11:44.506 --> 11:46.149
You're probably just
building up a tolerance.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.424
No, I'm not.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.756
Look, this is cutting-edge,
avant-garde treatment.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.048
Okay. Well,
I'm sure you'll get

11:51.132 --> 11:52.506
the Nobel Prize once
you're dead.

11:52.590 --> 11:53.965
Is that a threat?

11:54.048 --> 11:55.548
Can you fix it or not?

11:57.132 --> 11:58.211
- All right.
- Okay.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.923
Here.

12:04.340 --> 12:06.132
Your emotions must
be running pretty high,

12:06.215 --> 12:08.215
in order for you
to override the system.

12:08.299 --> 12:10.840
Yeah. I have an unnaturally
high level of cortisol,

12:10.923 --> 12:13.382
so my emotions are
running high all the time.

12:13.465 --> 12:16.715
But you cannot keep
using biochemistry as an excuse,

12:16.798 --> 12:17.798
all the time.

12:19.756 --> 12:22.715
So, I'm assuming that the date
was a disappointment then?

12:22.798 --> 12:24.048
I mean...

12:24.132 --> 12:25.548
Given that its primary function,

12:25.631 --> 12:28.673
was to test if I could partake
in a customary social situation

12:28.756 --> 12:30.191
without beating
the shit out of someone,

12:30.215 --> 12:31.334
then yeah, I would say yeah.

12:31.382 --> 12:33.048
It was a... it was
a real disappointment.

12:33.132 --> 12:34.424
How badly did you hurt him?

12:34.506 --> 12:36.631
I didn't
even get round to him.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.048
Who did you get around to?

12:40.132 --> 12:43.923
A waitress. Look, it doesn't
matter. Your thing failed.

12:44.007 --> 12:47.756
Lindy, this is not
a cure. I've told you that.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.479
The only way we're
going to make progress,

12:49.548 --> 12:52.299
is if you begin to
reconcile with your past.

12:52.382 --> 12:53.631
I've told you my story.

12:53.715 --> 12:57.007
But there's a difference,
between talking about your past,

12:57.090 --> 12:59.215
and actually working through it.

13:15.881 --> 13:16.881
Asphyxiation?

13:18.215 --> 13:19.756
Jugular bleed.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.048
Classy.

13:21.132 --> 13:22.132
Here you go.

13:23.424 --> 13:24.840
I've upped the voltage,

13:24.923 --> 13:27.090
but there's only so much

13:27.173 --> 13:28.923
that the human body can take.

13:29.007 --> 13:31.715
You don't care about
me. I'm just an experiment.

13:31.798 --> 13:35.173
Why would I risk my
life's work if I didn't care?

13:35.257 --> 13:37.382
And why won't you admit
that you really like this guy?

13:37.465 --> 13:39.007
Because I didn't.

13:39.090 --> 13:40.465
Okay.

13:40.548 --> 13:41.673
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

13:41.756 --> 13:43.007
I think last night proved that

13:43.090 --> 13:45.090
your exposure therapy
didn't work.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.715
What... what... what
would you like me to do? Hmm?

13:47.798 --> 13:49.596
Would you like me to
put leeches on your skin?

13:49.673 --> 13:51.299
Would you like me to drill
a hole,

13:51.382 --> 13:53.382
in your head to release
the demons?

13:53.465 --> 13:55.631
Would you like me to
make you drink your own urine?

13:55.715 --> 13:56.715
Actually tried that.

13:56.798 --> 13:58.299
That's disgusting.

13:58.382 --> 14:00.923
Anyway, I think
that really you need to admit,

14:01.007 --> 14:02.715
that the answer to all of
your problems

14:02.798 --> 14:05.424
is close,
human connection.

14:05.506 --> 14:08.215
Penis is not
gonna fix me, Dr. Freud.

14:08.299 --> 14:09.465
Um, I just...

14:09.548 --> 14:10.840
And I've tried that as well.

14:10.923 --> 14:12.774
You like this guy, so
for once have a relationship.

14:12.798 --> 14:13.798
Oh, please fuck off.

14:13.881 --> 14:15.465
I'm talking about love.

14:15.548 --> 14:16.923
No, I don't want a boyfriend!

14:17.007 --> 14:19.233
We both know I'd end up knocking
his teeth down his throat.

14:19.257 --> 14:21.275
Maybe you won't, but I don't
know why you would walk away,

14:21.299 --> 14:23.090
from somebody
who made you feel something.

14:23.173 --> 14:24.299
Ugh!

14:24.382 --> 14:25.673
Okay, I'm walking away
from you,

14:25.756 --> 14:27.066
'cause you're getting on
my nerves.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.090
Thank you.

14:28.173 --> 14:29.212
See you next week.

14:29.257 --> 14:30.715
Yeah, I can't wait.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.923
Looks so good.

14:53.007 --> 14:54.173
Thank you so much.

14:54.257 --> 14:55.923
- Not bad, huh?
- Well...

14:56.007 --> 14:57.840
Not a shitty waitress in sight!

14:58.756 --> 14:59.965
No.

15:00.048 --> 15:01.382
I'm glad you called.

15:01.465 --> 15:04.257
I'd hate to miss a second chance
to disappoint a pretty face.

15:04.340 --> 15:06.048
How are you planning
on doing that?

15:06.798 --> 15:08.465
I don't know.

15:08.548 --> 15:11.048
Depends if you find lame-ass
accountants cool or not.

15:11.132 --> 15:13.299
Well, that depends.
Who do you work for?

15:13.382 --> 15:16.506
I work for a private
company. This guy named Barry.

15:16.590 --> 15:17.590
You? What do you do?

15:17.673 --> 15:20.173
I used to work in Security.

15:20.257 --> 15:24.090
Okay. So you know your way
around a pair of handcuffs?

15:24.173 --> 15:28.673
Less BDSM, more...
bouncer in a crappy bar.

15:28.756 --> 15:31.132
You're not
a bouncer!

15:31.215 --> 15:32.465
Yeah! What?

15:32.548 --> 15:34.066
What do you weigh?
Like a Buck-O-Eight?

15:34.090 --> 15:35.449
- It's not about size Justin.
- No?

15:35.506 --> 15:36.840
Don't know what you've heard...

15:36.923 --> 15:37.923
Then what's it about?

15:38.007 --> 15:40.965
Other things,
like speed and endurance,

15:41.048 --> 15:42.631
fearlessness, things like that.

15:42.715 --> 15:44.506
Okay. What happened?

15:44.590 --> 15:45.590
Mmm...

15:46.424 --> 15:47.756
You crazy bitch!

15:49.299 --> 15:50.798
Um...

15:50.881 --> 15:52.881
I'm currently
seeking a new career path.

15:52.965 --> 15:54.299
Oh, you got fired.

15:54.382 --> 15:55.965
Yes. Well, it wasn't my fault.

15:56.048 --> 15:57.926
It... I mean, it was
actually entirely my fault.

15:57.965 --> 15:59.965
I don't know.
My heart wasn't in it.

16:01.007 --> 16:02.007
No?

16:03.382 --> 16:04.631
What is your heart in?

16:06.340 --> 16:08.340
I like photography.

16:08.424 --> 16:10.548
Yeah? What do
you take pictures of?

16:10.631 --> 16:12.506
Mostly, naked accountants.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.506
I don't know, just
people going about their lives.

16:16.590 --> 16:19.548
I... I just... I take pictures
on my phone sometimes for fun.

16:19.631 --> 16:20.673
It's not really...

16:20.756 --> 16:22.024
It sounds kinda
voyeuristic to me.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.590
Oh, I am wanking, constantly.

16:25.090 --> 16:29.923
Well, uh... I'm sorry if
I can seem kind of boring.

16:30.007 --> 16:32.673
Thank you for
apologizing. I am quite bored.

16:34.173 --> 16:35.483
There's nothing
I can do about it.

16:35.506 --> 16:37.275
There are a couple of
things that you could do.

16:37.299 --> 16:38.506
What can I do?

16:49.756 --> 16:51.090
Maybe this is a mistake.

16:52.382 --> 16:55.048
I have to warn you,
I'm really crap at dating.

16:56.299 --> 16:57.299
How bad could you be?

17:06.756 --> 17:07.839
Very bad.

17:08.923 --> 17:10.173
I'm not scared of you.

17:11.382 --> 17:12.756
Well, maybe you should be.

17:42.881 --> 17:45.132
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Hold...

17:48.215 --> 17:49.215
It's, um...

17:49.965 --> 17:52.007
They're... they're...

17:52.590 --> 17:53.590
They're a...

17:53.673 --> 17:54.756
Is that like a...

17:55.548 --> 17:57.007
Like a kinky thing or?

17:57.090 --> 17:59.424
No. No.

18:00.424 --> 18:01.424
Okay.

18:05.548 --> 18:08.506
Uh, look,
the thing is Justin, I...

18:08.590 --> 18:09.840
- Hey.
- Um...

18:13.382 --> 18:14.382
Hey...

18:16.631 --> 18:17.631
It's not...

18:19.631 --> 18:20.715
a big...

18:22.007 --> 18:23.007
deal.

18:46.007 --> 18:48.673
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

19:28.424 --> 19:29.424
Good morning.

19:30.382 --> 19:31.590
More like afternoon.

19:31.673 --> 19:33.072
You look so cute
when you're asleep,

19:33.132 --> 19:34.424
and I didn't wanna wake you up.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.756
Not really used
to being called cute.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.506
No? Well, you are.

19:38.590 --> 19:40.715
When you let your guard down.

19:40.798 --> 19:42.132
Your place is weird.

19:43.631 --> 19:46.007
Ah, it's...
you know, it's good weird.

19:46.090 --> 19:48.215
What's with all
the plastic plates and cups?

19:48.299 --> 19:49.590
You just move in?

19:49.673 --> 19:52.673
No, uh, just,
I... I hate washing up.

19:54.048 --> 19:56.798
Well, in addition to the world's
most expensive Danish,

19:56.881 --> 19:59.048
I got you a little something.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.840
Wow. Am I amazing in bed?

20:01.923 --> 20:03.590
Yeah.

20:11.798 --> 20:12.881
Oh, my God!

20:15.090 --> 20:16.465
Oh, no. That's too much.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.007
No, it's not.

20:19.798 --> 20:20.798
Wow!

20:21.673 --> 20:22.756
- You like it?
- Love it!

20:22.840 --> 20:23.923
Thank you.

20:27.048 --> 20:29.840
Oh, um,
by the way, last night...

20:29.923 --> 20:31.424
I... I never do that.

20:31.506 --> 20:32.756
No?

20:32.840 --> 20:33.923
No. I mean, never.

20:34.007 --> 20:37.340
Well, I'm... I'm glad you did.

20:37.424 --> 20:39.798
You are...
you're full of surprises.

20:39.881 --> 20:42.923
The least of which is,
um, this whole situation.

20:43.007 --> 20:44.506
You, uh, you wanna elaborate?

20:44.590 --> 20:46.424
Now that we know
each other better.

20:46.506 --> 20:49.923
Yeah. Um...

20:50.007 --> 20:52.506
You know what?
You don't have to. I'm sorry.

20:52.590 --> 20:58.506
No! I will. Uh, it's a new
treatment for this... thing.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.983
You're not gonna
die on me, are you?

21:00.007 --> 21:01.173
No. No, no, no.

21:01.257 --> 21:02.441
That'd be just
my luck, you know?

21:02.465 --> 21:04.257
I meet the most
amazing woman in the city

21:04.340 --> 21:05.840
and you got six months to live?

21:05.923 --> 21:07.756
No, I've got, um...

21:08.923 --> 21:11.340
an impulse control problem.

21:11.424 --> 21:13.465
And that helps
me to not have it.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.132
Like Tourette's?

21:15.215 --> 21:20.382
No. Um, just
tiny bit more intense.

21:20.465 --> 21:21.673
Okay.

21:21.756 --> 21:24.715
Uh, well, I mean,
have you tried meditation

21:24.798 --> 21:25.798
or something?

21:25.881 --> 21:26.881
Yeah, sort of.

21:30.631 --> 21:31.798
Yoga...

21:33.340 --> 21:34.840
Medication...

21:35.756 --> 21:37.382
Extreme sports...

21:41.631 --> 21:43.549
You know, I've tried
like, a whole lot of things,

21:43.590 --> 21:45.756
picked up lots of useless skills

21:45.840 --> 21:50.007
and, um, that's
the thing that... that helps.

21:51.215 --> 21:53.132
Well, I don't see
anything wrong with you.

22:03.007 --> 22:05.590
Mm-mmm. No, no,
no. I gotta go to work.

22:05.673 --> 22:06.912
Well, can't
you say you're sick?

22:06.965 --> 22:09.257
No, I can't. Barry
will totally bust my balls.

22:09.340 --> 22:10.631
Oh, okay. Well, no, leave...

22:10.715 --> 22:13.048
leave the balls exactly
as they are, they were good.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.465
Um, but can't you say

22:14.548 --> 22:15.857
that something came
up with another client?

22:15.881 --> 22:17.631
Well, I only have one...

22:17.715 --> 22:19.965
and he pays for
my exclusivity, so...

22:20.965 --> 22:22.048
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.048
Come to my place tonight.

22:24.132 --> 22:25.756
Yeah? I'll cook.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.506
I'm a fucking ninja
with a piece of halibut.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.673
It's fine. It's fine! Relax.

23:01.756 --> 23:02.756
You're early!

23:02.840 --> 23:03.941
Yes, I was excited to see you!

23:03.965 --> 23:05.090
Why?

23:05.173 --> 23:06.506
Because you're a genius.

23:06.590 --> 23:09.132
You're a bald
and burnished genius.

23:09.215 --> 23:10.257
I'm cured.

23:10.340 --> 23:11.881
Oh, you saw him again?

23:11.965 --> 23:13.715
And, I had an impulse, but...

23:13.798 --> 23:15.257
it wasn't a
breaking his legs,

23:15.340 --> 23:16.538
smash his face in, slamming...

23:16.590 --> 23:17.774
Actually, there
was a bit of slamming.

23:17.798 --> 23:21.465
But it was warm
and romantic and...

23:21.548 --> 23:23.215
and filthy.

23:23.299 --> 23:24.715
This is progress.

23:25.923 --> 23:27.007
Very good.

23:27.090 --> 23:28.465
Very good?

23:28.548 --> 23:29.840
It's brilliant!

23:29.923 --> 23:31.506
Listen, I took the vest off.

23:31.590 --> 23:32.881
Wow! Wow.

23:32.965 --> 23:34.132
A couple more weeks,

23:34.215 --> 23:35.899
- I'm not even gonna need this.
- That's great!

23:35.923 --> 23:37.756
But I think it's
temporary euphoria.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.257
I can't stop thinking about him.

23:39.340 --> 23:42.382
His hands, his face,
his hair smells really amazing...

23:42.465 --> 23:43.506
Oh, my God! The penis!

23:43.590 --> 23:44.983
I almost called
you in the middle of it.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.090
It, like,
unfurled itself, like...

23:47.173 --> 23:49.548
to ten times its length,
like... like a travel umbrella!

23:49.631 --> 23:51.340
- I've only ever heard of that.
- Yeah!

23:51.424 --> 23:52.673
- Never actually seen it!
- No.

23:52.756 --> 23:54.066
- Grower. Amazing!
- I wouldn't know...

23:54.090 --> 23:55.840
Yeah. Wow.

23:57.132 --> 23:58.382
I didn't know those existed.

23:58.465 --> 23:59.941
Oh, and he's
cooking me dinner tonight.

23:59.965 --> 24:02.215
- Stop it.
- Hmm. Fish.

24:02.299 --> 24:04.715
Fish! But you don't like fish.

24:04.798 --> 24:06.548
No, but people change.

24:06.631 --> 24:07.816
- They do.
- I've changed.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.483
It's true.
Okay, why don't we sit down

24:09.506 --> 24:11.024
and let's have
a little chat about this?

24:11.048 --> 24:13.007
- Because... Okay, all right.
- Boring and snooze.

24:13.090 --> 24:14.340
Because I want to celebrate!

24:14.424 --> 24:15.840
Can we open
a bottle of something?

24:15.923 --> 24:18.007
No, it's ten
o'clock in the morning.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.316
Okay, you're being a bad friend.

24:19.340 --> 24:21.798
I'm not your friend.
I'm your psychiatrist.

24:23.382 --> 24:24.756
I finally want
to talk about dick,

24:24.840 --> 24:26.465
you should be salivating.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.548
Gross. No, look,
sit down, please, all right?

24:29.631 --> 24:30.774
No, I don't
need a session today.

24:30.798 --> 24:32.299
Yes, you do,
because you're manic

24:32.382 --> 24:34.215
and it's making
me incredibly anxious.

24:34.299 --> 24:35.899
- And I'm worried about you.
- Don't be anxious.

24:35.923 --> 24:37.132
- I am though.
- I love you.

24:37.215 --> 24:39.132
Okay. Uh, love you too.

24:39.215 --> 24:41.090
- I love you more!
- Oh, boy.

- Justin?

25:33.590 --> 25:36.548
No. This is Detective Vicars.

25:36.631 --> 25:37.923
Homicide.

25:43.382 --> 25:44.881
But how do
you know it was murder?

25:44.965 --> 25:46.506
His body was
found in a dumpster,

25:46.590 --> 25:48.424
with two gunshot
wounds to the head.

25:53.923 --> 25:55.173
Were you together very long?

25:55.257 --> 25:58.965
Tonight was
gonna be our third date.

25:59.048 --> 26:02.715
He was... was
gonna cook me dinner.

26:04.382 --> 26:05.590
Fish.

26:05.673 --> 26:06.840
Salmon?

26:07.548 --> 26:08.548
Halibut.

26:08.631 --> 26:10.257
Hmm.

26:10.340 --> 26:12.299
You know any of his friends,
family or coworkers?

26:12.382 --> 26:15.340
No. I... I know
he's an accountant.

26:15.424 --> 26:18.257
He... was an accountant.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.506
But he only had one client.

26:20.590 --> 26:22.506
Some guy named Barry.

26:22.590 --> 26:23.840
We're gonna find who did this.

26:23.923 --> 26:25.441
Let's not give
the lady false hope.

26:25.465 --> 26:27.007
Statistically, it's unlikely.

26:27.090 --> 26:28.524
I'm not giving her anything.

26:28.548 --> 26:29.983
I'm reassuring
her we're gonna do our best.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.465
Some people prefer honesty.

26:31.548 --> 26:32.607
Some people prefer compassion.

26:32.631 --> 26:34.132
Can I see him?

26:34.215 --> 26:35.548
No. Family only right now.

26:35.631 --> 26:36.923
Can I talk to his family?

26:37.007 --> 26:38.275
We haven't been
able to find anyone yet.

26:38.299 --> 26:39.691
But then who's
gonna mind if I see him?

26:39.715 --> 26:41.007
Policy's gonna mind.

26:41.090 --> 26:43.090
- Those are the rules.
- She loves rules.

26:43.173 --> 26:46.132
Look, we really are
very sorry, for your loss.

26:47.965 --> 26:49.173
Aah!

27:00.715 --> 27:02.191
Sounds like
your guy was involved

27:02.215 --> 27:03.631
in some pretty sketchy business.

27:04.673 --> 27:07.048
Dodged a bullet or two.

27:07.132 --> 27:09.007
All right, listen.
Just give us a call,

27:09.090 --> 27:10.548
if you remember anything else.

27:11.424 --> 27:12.424
Thanks.

27:18.215 --> 27:19.798
What the fuck-hell was that?

27:19.881 --> 27:21.840
She was upset.

27:21.923 --> 27:23.941
She's grieving, I'm... I'm
just trying to comfort her.

27:23.965 --> 27:25.590
I think she's angry.

27:25.673 --> 27:27.299
I don't think so.

27:28.173 --> 27:29.798
That's why you like her.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.923
You like 'em with
a little rage bottled up inside.

27:32.007 --> 27:33.631
Better in bed,

27:33.715 --> 27:36.299
until it blows up in
your stupid-ass face.

27:36.382 --> 27:40.465
"I'm a big strong policeman."

27:40.548 --> 27:44.048
"Let me embrace you, and
comfort your grieving vagina."

27:45.299 --> 27:47.215
I don't
wanna comfort a vagina.

28:14.132 --> 28:18.465
It's not a big deal.

28:44.506 --> 28:45.548
Stop!

28:45.631 --> 28:47.382
You fixed me, now he's dead!

28:48.548 --> 28:50.173
Ah! It's not working.

28:50.257 --> 28:51.774
I'm going to get you a sedative.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.382
Now, you have
to stop shocking yourself.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.465
Lindy? Lindy?

29:03.756 --> 29:05.506
I'm not scared of you.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.923
Lindy?

29:23.673 --> 29:24.756
Lindy?

29:27.299 --> 29:29.340
Lindy?

29:30.257 --> 29:31.257
Where is it?

29:32.090 --> 29:33.506
You're holding it.

29:37.715 --> 29:38.715
How do you feel?

29:41.424 --> 29:43.590
I want to crush
your skull with my bare hands.

29:46.007 --> 29:47.590
I'm sorry about Justin.

29:49.506 --> 29:51.340
I mean, they acted
like it was no big deal.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.090
Who?

29:53.173 --> 29:54.424
The police.

29:54.506 --> 29:56.265
Well, don't focus on
them. Focus on yourself.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.299
It's obvious
they thought his boss

29:58.382 --> 30:00.007
had something to do with it.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.673
Which, I mean, of course.
Right? He only had one client.

30:02.756 --> 30:04.007
That's a bit weird, isn't it?

30:05.090 --> 30:06.506
I am sure they'll figure it out.

30:06.590 --> 30:07.840
Fuck them!

30:07.923 --> 30:10.257
No, I need to
find out who did this.

30:10.340 --> 30:12.382
I have to talk to Justin's boss.

30:12.465 --> 30:13.798
What if
you just took a moment,

30:13.881 --> 30:14.920
- and you felt...
- What if

30:14.965 --> 30:15.965
I just snapped your neck?

30:16.048 --> 30:18.424
I'm gonna find
the fuckers who did this.

30:18.506 --> 30:20.132
If you go down that path,

30:20.215 --> 30:22.424
you are never,
ever going to get better.

30:23.215 --> 30:24.215
Fuck.

30:24.299 --> 30:25.715
You're gonna kill somebody.

30:25.798 --> 30:27.673
- You're fucking right I am.
- Wait!

30:27.756 --> 30:28.941
I have to
tell you something...

30:28.965 --> 30:30.590
Look! Some people cry. Some
people drink.

30:30.673 --> 30:33.590
Some people write
shit poetry. I hurt people.

30:33.673 --> 30:35.173
Might as well
put it to good use.

30:56.715 --> 30:57.798
Vicars.

30:57.881 --> 30:59.548
Hi,
Detective Vicars?

30:59.631 --> 31:01.048
I need to talk to you.

31:01.132 --> 31:05.215
I... I think I have more
information but I'm scared.

31:05.299 --> 31:07.881
Can you come
meet me at my place?

31:07.965 --> 31:09.798
Yeah. Yeah,
we'll be right there.

33:07.340 --> 33:08.881
Hello?

33:08.965 --> 33:11.965
Hi, Lindy,
it's Detective Vicars.

33:12.048 --> 33:13.090
Lindy?

33:13.173 --> 33:16.548
Hello Detective. You're
angry, right?

33:16.631 --> 33:18.090
Why are you stealing evidence?

33:18.173 --> 33:20.090
Because I want to
find out what happened.

33:20.173 --> 33:21.673
That's my job.

33:21.756 --> 33:24.340
Uh-huh. How's
that going for you?

33:24.424 --> 33:25.715
I found you, didn't I?

33:25.798 --> 33:27.881
- What?
- My partner wants to bring you

33:27.965 --> 33:30.673
in for interfering with an
investigation, and robbery and

33:30.756 --> 33:32.149
probably a whole
bunch of other stuff

33:32.173 --> 33:33.631
'cause she's
ridiculously thorough.

33:33.715 --> 33:36.382
But I wanted to give you the
chance to come in on your own

33:36.465 --> 33:38.257
and clear up this
misunderstanding.

33:38.340 --> 33:40.299
Without all the, you know, jail.

33:40.382 --> 33:41.715
She's on her way up now.

33:41.798 --> 33:44.090
- Fucking balls. Where are you?
- I'm parked out front.

33:44.173 --> 33:45.590
She's not going
to shoot me, is she?

33:45.673 --> 33:46.673
No, of course not.

33:46.756 --> 33:48.756
- Freeze!
- Fuck!

33:49.923 --> 33:50.923
Then again, she might...

33:51.007 --> 33:52.548
So here's what's gonna happen.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.983
You're gonna put your arms over
your head, I'm gonna cuff you,

33:55.007 --> 33:56.756
I'm gonna take
you down to the station,

33:56.840 --> 33:59.024
- and then I'm gonna book you.
- What if I have other plans?

33:59.048 --> 34:00.340
I'll fucking shoot you.

34:00.424 --> 34:02.631
And then waste a bunch
of time writing up a report,

34:02.715 --> 34:04.881
instead of hunting
down your boyfriend's killer.

34:04.965 --> 34:06.590
Wasn't actually
my boyfriend yet.

34:06.673 --> 34:07.715
Commitment issues?

34:07.798 --> 34:09.299
It was early days.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.275
As if dating in
the city wasn't hard enough.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.132
You finally find a good man,

34:13.215 --> 34:15.424
and boom,
two bullets to the brain.

34:15.505 --> 34:17.007
Your partner is a trip, Vicars.

34:17.090 --> 34:18.672
Hey, Nevin...

34:18.755 --> 34:20.132
Is that?

34:20.215 --> 34:22.965
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:23.047 --> 34:24.797
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.672
Please don't tell me,

34:35.755 --> 34:37.590
you just called
this murder suspect...

34:41.007 --> 34:42.505
Sorry. Having a bad day.

34:42.590 --> 34:44.755
- Freeze!
- I didn't kill him!

34:44.840 --> 34:46.922
Bitch.

34:55.257 --> 34:57.340
- Hello?
- Oh. Hi, Detective.

34:57.424 --> 35:00.673
Lindy, is everything
okay up there? Is Nevin okay?

35:00.756 --> 35:02.590
Little
busy at the moment.

35:02.673 --> 35:03.923
Busy doing what?

35:06.048 --> 35:08.132
Remembering
how to drive stick.

35:08.215 --> 35:09.215
What?

35:12.631 --> 35:15.257
- Stupid motherfucker.
- Ow, ow, ow.

35:16.299 --> 35:18.590
Holy shit! I know that sound.

35:18.673 --> 35:20.590
That's a McLaren 600LT Spider?

35:20.673 --> 35:22.048
It's a car.

35:24.881 --> 35:26.798
A really fast one.

35:26.881 --> 35:28.965
Are you still on the phone
with that kooky cuntcicle?

35:34.257 --> 35:36.090
Fucking go! Go! Go!

35:40.299 --> 35:42.631
Where did you learn to drive?
You even trying to catch her?

35:42.715 --> 35:43.965
I'm flooring it!

35:44.048 --> 35:45.649
Guys, it's
quite hard to concentrate

35:45.673 --> 35:46.840
with you two bickering.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.673
Oh!

35:57.715 --> 35:59.506
Oh, crap!

36:01.173 --> 36:02.923
- Come on, Lindy.
- Ooh.

36:03.007 --> 36:04.941
I think I'm starting to get
the hang of this stick shift.

36:04.965 --> 36:07.340
Oh, shit. Reverse!

36:18.881 --> 36:19.881
Damn it!

36:22.173 --> 36:25.215
Lindy, please stay on the phone.
I'm trying to help you.

36:25.299 --> 36:27.715
Okay. I really
have to concentrate now,

36:27.798 --> 36:29.673
so, it's been
really nice catching up.

36:29.756 --> 36:32.756
No, wait! You go
through with this and you're...

36:32.840 --> 36:34.299
You're on your own.

36:34.382 --> 36:35.382
Same as always.

36:37.173 --> 36:38.173
Lindy!

36:39.382 --> 36:40.881
Damn it!

36:40.965 --> 36:42.132
Shit!

36:47.631 --> 36:49.941
I'm trying to help you. You're
going to get somebody killed.

36:49.965 --> 36:52.083
If you think I had anything to
do with Justin's death,

36:52.132 --> 36:53.816
then you're shitter at your
jobs than I thought.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.024
We don't think you killed
Justin...

36:55.048 --> 36:56.048
Speak for yourself!

37:03.340 --> 37:04.548
Whoa! Argh!

37:06.506 --> 37:07.825
- Get 'em!
- Yeah!

37:42.257 --> 37:43.715
Ah! The fuck...

37:44.798 --> 37:46.424
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't bitch out!

37:46.506 --> 37:47.590
Fine! Fine! Fine!

37:58.340 --> 37:59.798
Fuck.

38:27.965 --> 38:29.358
If you
can't ascertain the cause,

38:29.382 --> 38:30.965
of the outbreak,
then you have no idea,

38:31.048 --> 38:32.774
how many zombies
you'll have to kill over time.

38:32.798 --> 38:34.965
A lightsaber
would solve both problems.

38:35.048 --> 38:37.506
We specified
a real-world scenario.

38:37.590 --> 38:39.798
Yeah, a real zombie apocalypse.

38:39.881 --> 38:41.919
Besides, there's no way
to recharge the lightsaber's

38:41.965 --> 38:44.631
Diatium power cell
after it ran out.

38:44.715 --> 38:46.840
Diatium power cells
don't run out of energy.

38:46.923 --> 38:48.090
They recycle it.

38:51.215 --> 38:52.631
Who's in charge around here?

38:53.424 --> 38:55.590
I'm... I... I'm the manager.

38:55.673 --> 38:56.798
If you're the manager

38:56.881 --> 38:58.441
then you're the last person,
I want to talk to.

38:58.465 --> 39:00.441
I need someone who actually
knows what they're doing.

39:00.465 --> 39:02.343
Who's the biggest
geek you've got in this place?

39:03.340 --> 39:04.424
- Andy.
- Andy.

39:04.506 --> 39:05.506
Andy.

39:16.548 --> 39:18.590
Okay, so what? Forget
your password or something?

39:18.673 --> 39:19.715
No.

39:19.798 --> 39:21.590
It's more, the man
I loved was murdered

39:21.673 --> 39:23.340
and I stole
his phone from the police,

39:23.424 --> 39:24.774
and now I've got to
track down the bad guy

39:24.798 --> 39:26.840
before they do, so
I can kill the shit out of them.

39:26.923 --> 39:28.715
Oh! Cool.

39:34.090 --> 39:35.923
And... we're in.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.048
Oh, wow. You're good.

39:37.132 --> 39:38.590
Obviously.

39:38.673 --> 39:41.756
Not much here, no
history. This must be a burner.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.400
Your boyfriend
a drug dealer or something?

39:43.424 --> 39:44.673
No, accountant.

39:44.756 --> 39:48.215
I mean, he wasn't...
We weren't... yet. You know.

39:48.299 --> 39:50.881
Yeah. Right, right. I get it.

39:50.965 --> 39:53.090
- I don't.
- Did your mouth just fart, Doug?

39:53.173 --> 39:54.340
Sorry.

39:56.090 --> 39:57.191
The last seven calls,

39:57.215 --> 39:59.840
came from
an abandoned building downtown.

39:59.923 --> 40:02.007
- Shady.
- What does that mean?

40:02.090 --> 40:04.007
I'm not sure.
Lets see who owns it.

40:07.382 --> 40:10.382
Barry Kasparzki. Whoa!

40:10.465 --> 40:12.840
FBI files showed
ties to arms dealers.

40:13.798 --> 40:14.798
Holy shit!

40:14.881 --> 40:16.340
That's the guy.

40:17.590 --> 40:18.590
How much do I owe you?

40:18.673 --> 40:20.840
Trust me, you can't afford me.

40:20.923 --> 40:22.007
Thanks.

40:23.215 --> 40:24.215
Oh.

41:26.631 --> 41:28.965
Boys, boys, boys!

41:29.048 --> 41:30.441
Whatever it is
you're fighting over,

41:30.465 --> 41:32.007
I'm sure we can all talk it out.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.340
Money...

41:33.424 --> 41:35.881
Yeah. You know, like bets?

41:35.965 --> 41:38.048
Oh! Duh.

41:38.132 --> 41:39.732
Is it too late to put
a dollar on the other one?

41:39.756 --> 41:40.983
Just 'cause
you're a bit of a bleeder

41:41.007 --> 41:42.233
and you drop
your left when you hook.

41:42.257 --> 41:43.424
What's going on?

41:43.506 --> 41:46.798
Oh, are you Barry? I guess so.

41:46.881 --> 41:48.048
Just, you seem like,

41:48.132 --> 41:49.441
you have
the biggest dick in here, so...

41:49.465 --> 41:50.465
What do you want?

41:50.548 --> 41:51.965
Well, I wanted
to pick your brains,

41:52.048 --> 41:53.840
about the phone
calls you have with the...

41:53.923 --> 41:55.673
accountant that works for you.

41:55.756 --> 41:56.798
Did you kill him?

41:56.881 --> 42:00.007
What are you? Cop? Fed?

42:00.090 --> 42:01.923
Oh no, girlfriend.

42:02.007 --> 42:03.299
I mean, I say girlfriend.

42:03.382 --> 42:05.340
We went on,
like, two dates but...

42:05.424 --> 42:07.840
you know, I was really
hopeful, I was crossing fingers.

42:07.923 --> 42:09.090
I didn't kill any accountant.

42:09.173 --> 42:10.631
- But you know who did.
- Probably!

42:10.715 --> 42:12.090
Well, amazing!

42:12.173 --> 42:14.424
I mean, that saves me
a massive headache. Barry!

42:14.506 --> 42:16.048
You're a sweetheart.

42:16.132 --> 42:17.923
I didn't say I'd tell you.

42:18.007 --> 42:19.983
Oh, seriously? Are you gonna
make me go through the whole,

42:20.007 --> 42:22.340
face-stomping,
bone-breaking routine?

42:23.798 --> 42:24.881
Okay, fine.

42:25.923 --> 42:26.923
I tell you what.

42:27.007 --> 42:28.965
How about I beat
three of your best guys,

42:29.048 --> 42:30.590
and you tell me the name?

42:30.673 --> 42:32.340
Sounds like fun.

42:32.424 --> 42:35.048
You, you and you.

42:36.048 --> 42:37.881
But not three in a row.

42:37.965 --> 42:39.382
All at the same time.

42:39.465 --> 42:41.548
I like a man who challenges me.

42:43.590 --> 42:46.048
Okay, so what
are the, like, rules?

42:46.132 --> 42:47.465
No rules.

42:48.715 --> 42:49.715
Oh.

42:51.048 --> 42:52.215
All right.

43:07.299 --> 43:08.881
Oh!

43:32.631 --> 43:33.923
Aah!

43:41.257 --> 43:42.673
Lucky guess.

43:48.548 --> 43:50.215
That's enough!

43:50.299 --> 43:51.881
Fight's over!

43:53.382 --> 43:55.090
Everybody out!

43:55.173 --> 43:56.965
If he had a bigger Adam's apple,

43:57.048 --> 43:58.108
this'd be really working for me.

44:12.965 --> 44:14.382
You don't mind, do you?

44:14.465 --> 44:16.715
I'm just a bit
parched after that.

44:19.132 --> 44:20.340
Oh! I needed that.

44:20.424 --> 44:22.506
Okay, you were gonna
tell me who killed Justin?

44:25.382 --> 44:27.465
Those men back there,

44:27.548 --> 44:29.340
they work for me,

44:29.424 --> 44:32.257
they respect me and
they pay tribute to me.

44:32.340 --> 44:33.923
They do this,

44:34.007 --> 44:36.756
because they know,
that I am a man of my word.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.965
Now...

44:38.048 --> 44:41.840
Business like this,
I like to keep private.

44:41.923 --> 44:43.548
'Cause the truth is,

44:43.631 --> 44:46.715
all that I have is
because of one thing,

44:46.798 --> 44:48.715
and one thing only.

44:48.798 --> 44:50.007
And that is...

44:50.090 --> 44:53.007
that I have never
been a man of my word.

44:55.923 --> 44:57.881
So, if you'll excuse me,

44:57.965 --> 45:00.382
I don't like to
get business on my suit.

45:00.465 --> 45:01.465
Okay.

45:01.548 --> 45:02.923
What is it about gross old men

45:03.007 --> 45:05.548
always underestimating women?

45:12.048 --> 45:14.048
Interesting ball color.

45:14.132 --> 45:15.548
What we calling that? Ox-blood?

45:15.631 --> 45:17.007
Claret?

45:17.090 --> 45:19.631
Just like a woman,
straight for the nuts!

45:19.715 --> 45:21.400
No. I only do
that when I'm in hurry.

45:21.424 --> 45:23.715
Although, evolution hasn't
really been kind to you guys,

45:23.798 --> 45:26.299
putting the on-off switch,
dangling around in front

45:26.382 --> 45:28.257
for any predator
to come by and flick.

45:28.340 --> 45:30.173
Now, who killed him?

45:30.257 --> 45:31.257
I don't know.

45:31.340 --> 45:32.506
Don't be silly!

45:32.590 --> 45:34.048
Gareth Fizel!

45:34.132 --> 45:35.465
Gareth Fizel!

45:35.548 --> 45:37.007
Yeah, he's my boss.

45:37.090 --> 45:39.090
Why would
he kill his accountant?

45:39.173 --> 45:40.840
Maybe he was skimming the books.

45:40.923 --> 45:43.007
Look, even the government,

45:43.090 --> 45:45.340
ain't dumb
enough to go after Fizel.

45:45.424 --> 45:47.631
Are you really that stupid?

45:47.715 --> 45:50.465
You know what? I think
I am exactly that stupid.

46:01.506 --> 46:02.965
You enjoying that?

46:03.923 --> 46:06.590
Mmm. Background check came in.

46:06.673 --> 46:09.382
Your li'l girlfriend,
she's got a history of violence.

46:09.465 --> 46:11.840
Assault. Harassment.

46:11.923 --> 46:15.007
Interesting job history
too. Classified-type shit.

46:15.090 --> 46:17.756
So she's got skills
and an anger issue.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.048
Not a great combo.

46:19.132 --> 46:20.774
I still don't think,
she's the type to blow

46:20.798 --> 46:21.798
her boyfriend's head off.

46:21.881 --> 46:23.548
Hope not, or else you're next.

46:25.132 --> 46:27.673
She's got a short fuse.
Doesn't make her a murderer.

46:27.756 --> 46:29.798
That's what happens
when you don't follow protocol.

46:29.881 --> 46:32.798
Sometimes common
sense trumps protocol.

46:32.881 --> 46:36.673
Nah. I'm good being the superior
one in this relationship.

46:38.673 --> 46:40.465
Wha... Hey! What
am I supposed to eat?

46:40.548 --> 46:43.881
I'll see what I can swipe from
the gunshot victim next door.

46:45.506 --> 46:48.382
Always taking such good
care of me. Thank you, partner.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.715
Aw, allergic to latex?

46:55.798 --> 46:57.340
You're no fun.

46:57.424 --> 47:01.424
Wow! Impressive
urine output. Good for you.

47:01.506 --> 47:02.840
Oh, don't bother.

47:02.923 --> 47:04.400
I'll run away and
you'll get yourself all

47:04.424 --> 47:06.548
emasculated trying to catch me.

47:06.631 --> 47:08.007
Here. I did get a bouquet,

47:08.090 --> 47:09.923
but I gave it to
this woman in the elevator.

47:10.007 --> 47:11.257
She was...

47:11.340 --> 47:13.257
Just been diagnosed
with something horrible

47:13.340 --> 47:15.218
and couldn't stop
crying. It was really awkward.

47:15.881 --> 47:17.090
Glad to see you're all right.

47:17.173 --> 47:19.257
I wanted to say thank
you for warning me and...

47:19.340 --> 47:20.548
I wasn't warning you.

47:20.631 --> 47:22.509
I was giving you a chance
to do the right thing.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.424
Well, thank you for
giving me the chance.

47:25.590 --> 47:27.215
Look, I found
out who killed Justin.

47:27.299 --> 47:28.715
Who?

47:28.798 --> 47:30.048
Gareth Fizel.

47:31.881 --> 47:33.007
You got any proof?

47:33.090 --> 47:35.257
Well, obviously
not the sort of person

47:35.340 --> 47:37.048
who gives a fuck about proof.

47:37.132 --> 47:39.048
What do you know about him?

47:39.132 --> 47:40.465
Billionaire recluse

47:40.548 --> 47:42.441
with his fingers in a bunch
of different illegal pies.

47:42.465 --> 47:44.090
He's pretty much untouchable.

47:44.173 --> 47:45.340
Oh, I'm gonna touch him.

47:45.424 --> 47:47.048
Hard.

47:47.132 --> 47:49.299
And a lot. And not in
a way he's gonna enjoy.

47:50.048 --> 47:51.548
Where can I find him?

47:51.631 --> 47:53.465
Why you doing this?

47:53.548 --> 47:56.506
Is this Justin really
worth you risking your life for?

47:56.590 --> 47:58.840
Yeah, it was early
days. I didn't know him.

47:58.923 --> 48:00.881
I didn't know half
the shit he was caught up in.

48:00.965 --> 48:03.715
But I do know,
he was a decent guy.

48:03.798 --> 48:05.506
He didn't
deserve to die like that.

48:05.590 --> 48:06.590
Nobody does.

48:06.673 --> 48:08.048
Well, no, but...

48:08.132 --> 48:10.548
Most people make me
want to run away screaming,

48:10.631 --> 48:12.715
or snap their fingers
off. He was...

48:13.673 --> 48:14.923
He was nice.

48:15.007 --> 48:17.215
He was... He was really nice.

48:17.299 --> 48:18.840
There's lots of
nice guys out there.

48:18.923 --> 48:20.299
Yeah.

48:20.382 --> 48:22.173
They're all frightened of me.

48:22.257 --> 48:23.881
He wanted to cook me fish.

48:28.048 --> 48:29.548
The Imperion Tower. Downtown.

48:30.548 --> 48:31.840
Thank you.

48:31.923 --> 48:33.382
I can't let you go there.

48:33.465 --> 48:35.798
You're not in a great
position to stop me, are you?

48:35.881 --> 48:37.090
But I am.

48:38.590 --> 48:40.007
Get back!

48:49.132 --> 48:50.548
Get back here right now!

49:09.340 --> 49:10.340
Stop!

49:13.340 --> 49:15.173
Sorry.

49:15.257 --> 49:16.590
Bitch, get back here!

50:09.299 --> 50:10.299
Fuck.

50:16.424 --> 50:17.424
Shh!

50:21.673 --> 50:22.673
Shh!

50:25.424 --> 50:26.424
Shh!

50:36.424 --> 50:37.424
Shh!

50:43.299 --> 50:44.590
Ow!

50:44.673 --> 50:45.673
Fuck!

50:51.007 --> 50:52.424
Shh! Stop it. Stop it.

50:55.132 --> 50:56.798
Freeze!

50:56.881 --> 51:00.257
Don't move, don't
breathe, don't fucking fart!

51:00.340 --> 51:01.382
Oh, come on.

51:01.465 --> 51:02.691
You're not
gonna start shit in here.

51:02.715 --> 51:03.756
I will shoot you.

51:04.673 --> 51:05.673
Put the gun down.

51:05.756 --> 51:07.007
Why would I do that?

51:07.090 --> 51:08.382
Because I want you to be ready.

51:08.465 --> 51:09.840
Ready for what?

51:10.590 --> 51:11.798
This!

51:12.715 --> 51:14.673
Catch!

51:17.382 --> 51:18.548
Freeze!

51:18.631 --> 51:19.923
Don't you dare!

51:20.007 --> 51:22.090
Don't do it.

51:22.173 --> 51:23.340
- Seriously?
- I trust you!

51:28.340 --> 51:29.424
Aah!

51:30.090 --> 51:31.715
Oh.

52:17.340 --> 52:18.631
Can I help you?

52:18.715 --> 52:21.132
Gareth Fizel.

52:21.215 --> 52:23.215
There's no one
here by that name.

52:23.299 --> 52:24.424
Okay.

52:24.506 --> 52:26.066
It's gonna be a lot
less painful for you,

52:26.090 --> 52:27.732
if you just point me
in the right direction.

52:27.756 --> 52:28.756
Good evening.

52:30.299 --> 52:31.673
Can I be of assistance?

52:31.756 --> 52:34.798
Mr. Delacroix, this woman...

52:34.881 --> 52:37.257
is asking for a Mr. Fizel.

52:37.340 --> 52:39.048
And she threatened me.

52:40.881 --> 52:42.173
You're fired.

52:42.257 --> 52:43.257
For what?

52:43.340 --> 52:44.840
Your tone. Miss?

52:46.756 --> 52:47.756
Right this way.

52:53.465 --> 52:55.548
That was some
pretty epic dick swinging.

53:18.756 --> 53:19.899
That's strange.
I would've thought,

53:19.923 --> 53:21.715
the big cheese
would be on the top floor.

53:23.548 --> 53:24.881
He is.

53:24.965 --> 53:25.965
Aah!

53:31.548 --> 53:33.340
Ow!

53:34.798 --> 53:38.215
Clean blow to my brachial
plexus nerve group. Good one.

53:40.923 --> 53:42.090
Um...

53:42.173 --> 53:44.382
You must be Security,

53:44.465 --> 53:46.923
unless this is some
really fucked up date.

53:47.007 --> 53:48.299
Head of. And you are?

53:48.382 --> 53:49.715
About to pee my pants.

53:49.798 --> 53:52.299
I had, like, four
Red Bulls on the way here.

53:52.382 --> 53:54.465
Is that what
the drain in the floor is for?

53:55.923 --> 53:57.424
What are these for?

53:57.506 --> 53:59.465
That is a really
bad idea to take those.

53:59.548 --> 54:01.965
- I need them.
- What for?

54:02.048 --> 54:03.590
A bad heart.

54:03.673 --> 54:05.715
Well, they're mine now.

54:05.798 --> 54:07.382
Why are you here?

54:07.465 --> 54:08.607
I need to see your boss.

54:08.631 --> 54:09.923
Regarding what?

54:10.007 --> 54:11.257
He killed Justin.

54:11.340 --> 54:12.382
Justin who?

54:12.465 --> 54:14.299
His accountant.

54:14.382 --> 54:16.215
Why would
he have killed your Justin?

54:16.299 --> 54:19.299
Oh, I don't know.
Boring everyday, bean counter

54:19.382 --> 54:21.631
who's cooking the books
for a shady arms dealer,

54:21.715 --> 54:24.173
suddenly assassinated
and tossed in a dumpster.

54:24.257 --> 54:26.923
Sounds like he had
information to disclose.

54:27.007 --> 54:29.215
Seemed like a solid lead.

54:29.299 --> 54:31.257
I mean, that and Barry told me.

54:32.424 --> 54:34.132
Are you a relation
of the deceased?

54:34.215 --> 54:36.299
No. I was...

54:37.215 --> 54:39.465
- Not, we were...
- I see.

54:39.548 --> 54:41.132
- Do you?
- No.

54:41.215 --> 54:43.132
Nor do I desire to.

54:43.215 --> 54:46.590
I am going to give you a chance
to vacate the premises,

54:46.673 --> 54:48.548
peacefully.

54:48.631 --> 54:50.090
What if I don't?

54:50.173 --> 54:53.506
You will find out what
the drainage system is for.

54:53.590 --> 54:56.506
And I will be keeping those.

55:25.299 --> 55:26.756
My life vest...

55:29.923 --> 55:31.590
I need my vest.

56:19.132 --> 56:21.465
Apologies for the disturbance.

56:21.548 --> 56:23.173
We've had a visitor, a woman.

56:24.465 --> 56:26.215
She's peculiar.

56:28.215 --> 56:29.715
I need to get out of the car.

56:31.715 --> 56:34.007
Can you let me out of the car?

56:34.090 --> 56:36.673
Look, miss, I don't
want to seem overly familiar,

56:36.756 --> 56:37.923
but I gotta take you home.

56:38.007 --> 56:39.965
Unlock this door and let me out!

56:40.881 --> 56:42.881
Asking about an accountant.

56:45.173 --> 56:46.631
A concern?

56:47.798 --> 56:49.382
Let me out of
the car for your sake!

56:49.465 --> 56:51.048
- Miss!
- Let me out!

56:51.132 --> 56:52.506
Let me out!

56:52.590 --> 56:54.132
I wasn't sure
who may have been aware,

56:54.215 --> 56:56.756
of her presence
here, so I opted to let her go.

56:58.007 --> 57:01.840
But enough of
a concern to bother me with.

57:12.506 --> 57:13.673
I'm sorry.

57:13.756 --> 57:14.881
I'm sorry!

57:21.548 --> 57:25.007
More like an unknown variable.

57:25.090 --> 57:30.548
You know... I don't
like unknown variables.

57:30.631 --> 57:31.881
Deal with her.

57:42.798 --> 57:43.881
Please help me?

57:43.965 --> 57:45.340
Oh, fuck!

57:46.090 --> 57:48.132
What are you doing here?

57:48.215 --> 57:49.923
I lost my device.

57:50.007 --> 57:52.382
Do you have another
here? I really need it. Please?

57:55.548 --> 57:57.215
What happened to the lamp?

57:57.299 --> 57:59.798
I figured, if things
got really bad, I could

57:59.881 --> 58:01.215
bite down on both ends.

58:02.382 --> 58:03.590
Don't do that.

58:11.340 --> 58:12.340
Sorry.

58:13.132 --> 58:15.048
Thanks.

58:15.132 --> 58:17.506
Have you seen
that movie Old Yeller?

58:17.590 --> 58:18.756
Uh, yeah. It's a classic.

58:18.840 --> 58:21.090
I've never seen it,
but I know how it ends.

58:21.173 --> 58:24.257
So if I... try anything,

58:25.132 --> 58:26.132
kill me.

58:32.465 --> 58:33.715
If I make this thing for you,

58:33.798 --> 58:35.215
will you stop
going after this guy?

58:37.631 --> 58:39.048
No.

58:39.132 --> 58:41.673
But I can promise more
innocent people won't get hurt

58:41.756 --> 58:42.923
along the way.

58:45.173 --> 58:46.173
Okay.

58:50.090 --> 58:52.923
Do you want some Chinese food?

58:53.007 --> 58:56.048
There's Kung Pao chicken
and sweet and sour... something,

58:56.132 --> 58:58.965
and some... egg
rolls and all that.

58:59.048 --> 59:00.465
You should eat something.

59:00.548 --> 59:02.299
Don't touch
the shrimp fried rice.

59:03.299 --> 59:05.382
That's mine.

59:08.881 --> 59:10.548
I'll get the vest.

01:00:42.756 --> 01:00:45.173
Je... Jesus!
What are you doing?

01:00:45.257 --> 01:00:46.732
I'm hiding from
the beat cops down the street.

01:00:46.756 --> 01:00:47.756
What are you doing?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.382
Is sitting outside my apartment,

01:00:49.465 --> 01:00:51.358
some kind of police foreplay?
Are you wearing my knickers?

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:52.382
I'm doing my job.

01:00:52.465 --> 01:00:53.756
Oh.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.673
I see we've taken down
another major drug kingpin.

01:00:56.756 --> 01:01:00.299
He got sent home from school
for setting the class pet free.

01:01:00.382 --> 01:01:01.798
Hmm. Hamster?

01:01:01.881 --> 01:01:04.340
Rabbit. Hey, listen to me.

01:01:04.424 --> 01:01:07.173
There's some pretty nasty guys
in the hospital, you know, and

01:01:07.257 --> 01:01:09.257
their description of
the deranged psycho

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.524
who put them there matches you.

01:01:10.548 --> 01:01:13.173
What? Come on. Little old me?

01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:14.358
How could you possibly think

01:01:14.382 --> 01:01:15.524
I could do anything like that?

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:17.465
Don't fuck
around with me, Lindy.

01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:20.590
Okay, but not now,
I need you to look after this.

01:01:20.673 --> 01:01:21.816
I'm not dumping
evidence for you!

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.340
I'm not asking you to.

01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:25.590
Look, I'm... I'm
giving you the chance

01:01:25.673 --> 01:01:26.923
to turn yourself in here.

01:01:27.007 --> 01:01:29.673
Okay, I will! Just not yet.

01:01:30.506 --> 01:01:31.923
Hey, listen to me.

01:01:32.007 --> 01:01:34.424
Fizel's not some
dickbag gangster, okay?

01:01:34.506 --> 01:01:35.649
He's going to be looking for you

01:01:35.673 --> 01:01:37.215
and he's going to kill you.

01:01:37.299 --> 01:01:39.132
Right. Well, he already tried.

01:01:39.215 --> 01:01:40.732
I think someone has
been in my apartment...

01:01:40.756 --> 01:01:42.382
Right, that's it.

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:44.548
- It ain't your choice anymore.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:46.965
That's a very
bad idea. I've got...

01:01:47.048 --> 01:01:48.590
this condition. Okay?

01:01:48.673 --> 01:01:51.631
It makes me snap. I can't
control it and I hurt people.

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:54.132
I wear this thing,
that gives me electric shocks,

01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:55.715
so that I can stop it happening.

01:01:55.798 --> 01:01:57.673
But, really, I really
don't want to hurt you

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:59.798
or anybody else.

01:02:00.798 --> 01:02:01.917
I don't think you'd hurt me.

01:02:01.965 --> 01:02:03.631
- No?
- No.

01:02:04.756 --> 01:02:06.257
Would you leave
me on my own with him?

01:02:07.798 --> 01:02:09.465
- Yeah.
- Bollocks!

01:02:09.548 --> 01:02:11.299
Well, I don't think
you'd hurt him either.

01:02:11.382 --> 01:02:12.465
You sure?

01:02:15.007 --> 01:02:16.257
What that thing feel like?

01:02:23.299 --> 01:02:24.299
Come on?

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.590
- What are you...
- Here.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.548
Okay, you know
what that tells me?

01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:43.673
I'm way more
screwed up than you thought.

01:02:43.756 --> 01:02:45.923
No. No, it tells me
that you'd rather hurt yourself

01:02:46.007 --> 01:02:47.215
than somebody else.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.257
Nevin says
I treat you different

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.506
because you're a woman.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:52.965
She says...

01:02:53.048 --> 01:02:54.048
I'm going easy on you.

01:02:54.132 --> 01:02:55.881
Is she right?

01:02:55.965 --> 01:02:58.007
I treat you different
because you are different.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.506
Nobody is looking for me now.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:09.840
Lindy!

01:03:13.173 --> 01:03:14.173
Whoa!

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.548
What's that?

01:03:15.631 --> 01:03:17.090
Dad?

01:03:18.007 --> 01:03:19.382
fuck!

01:03:30.631 --> 01:03:32.132
Lindy, listen to me!

01:03:32.215 --> 01:03:34.132
I'm a little
busy at the moment.

01:03:34.215 --> 01:03:36.257
Look, Lindy I don't
wanna play games anymore.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.590
You have to stop
looking for Justin's killer.

01:03:38.673 --> 01:03:39.798
You're gonna get hurt.

01:03:39.881 --> 01:03:41.798
I know what you're capable of.

01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:43.240
I read all
about it in your file...

01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:45.524
Okay. Are you done looking me up
on some bullshit database?

01:03:45.548 --> 01:03:47.007
'Cause, listen, Detective.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.424
I'm gonna do what I need to do.

01:03:49.506 --> 01:03:51.506
Lindy I don't wanna
see you wind up dead.

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:52.923
Just let us do our job.

01:03:53.007 --> 01:03:55.132
So, what?

01:03:55.215 --> 01:03:58.007
Does that mean you are gonna
go in and arrest Fizel?

01:03:58.965 --> 01:04:00.215
Yes, thought not.

01:04:34.506 --> 01:04:35.673
Fuck.

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:41.590
I was hoping to see you.

01:05:06.007 --> 01:05:07.257
You like lobster?

01:05:09.257 --> 01:05:13.257
Uh, I always thought
it was overrated and overpriced.

01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:16.382
Most people don't realize

01:05:16.465 --> 01:05:21.506
that lobster's belong in
the same biological phylum

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.007
as cockroaches.

01:05:25.715 --> 01:05:29.840
They are both anthropods
with segmented bodies.

01:05:29.923 --> 01:05:34.382
They both have the same compound
eyes and jointed legs.

01:05:34.465 --> 01:05:37.424
Even their meat is the same.

01:05:37.506 --> 01:05:39.923
Lobsters must be boiled alive.

01:05:40.673 --> 01:05:42.257
Cockroaches poisoned.

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.424
Wow.

01:05:44.506 --> 01:05:48.132
Ugly and boring.
What a winning combination.

01:05:48.215 --> 01:05:50.048
What the fuck has
this got to do with me?

01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:52.965
You are an odd specimen.

01:05:56.215 --> 01:06:00.673
Not sure what, uh,
phylum you belong in.

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.215
Me neither.

01:06:02.299 --> 01:06:04.881
That's something my therapist
and I are really delving in to.

01:06:06.132 --> 01:06:08.132
I understand
you are here to kill me.

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:11.465
Something about an accountant?

01:06:12.798 --> 01:06:15.673
Your... boyfriend?

01:06:15.756 --> 01:06:19.424
We hadn't put a label on
it, but he was pretty special.

01:06:20.173 --> 01:06:21.673
I kill a lot of people,

01:06:23.132 --> 01:06:26.382
I suppose some of them
may be accountants. I'm...

01:06:30.382 --> 01:06:32.090
I'm sorry I killed yours.

01:06:32.173 --> 01:06:33.548
Well, apology not accepted...

01:06:33.631 --> 01:06:35.090
You creepy fuck.

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:37.424
Rude...

01:06:40.798 --> 01:06:45.090
You are certainly
a... a rare species.

01:06:46.465 --> 01:06:50.965
I'm glad I took this
opportunity to get one good,

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.631
long, hard look at you.

01:06:55.299 --> 01:06:56.798
Okay, but can you do it...

01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:04.965
Without,

01:07:05.048 --> 01:07:07.590
whacking me on
the head this time.

01:07:07.673 --> 01:07:08.673
Fuck.

01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:12.048
Fuck.

01:07:14.715 --> 01:07:15.715
Balls!

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:17.798
Fuck balls indeed.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.715
I'm getting the feeling

01:07:20.798 --> 01:07:23.173
there's no cookie
and juice after this.

01:07:23.257 --> 01:07:24.465
Not for you.

01:07:24.548 --> 01:07:26.048
Wait, wait, wait!

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:28.007
Justin...

01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:30.299
Did you pull the trigger?

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:34.881
No. I didn't.
Though I wish I had.

01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:39.840
This is going
to take a sec so...

01:07:39.923 --> 01:07:42.673
- Sit back, relax.
- Fuck!

01:07:42.756 --> 01:07:44.514
- Enjoy the ride.
- What are you doing to me?

01:07:45.923 --> 01:07:48.548
Do you know what
exsanguination means?

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:51.590
The drainage of one's blood.

01:07:57.132 --> 01:07:58.132
Aah!

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.340
Aah!

01:08:27.299 --> 01:08:28.299
Aah!

01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:50.381
I have a few questions.

01:08:51.506 --> 01:08:53.381
How do I get to Fizel?

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:13.048
Hey! Where
do you think you're going?

01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:39.257
Get ready to die, you sick fuck!

01:10:59.715 --> 01:11:01.090
Justin!

01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:03.299
Bravo. Well done!

01:11:05.215 --> 01:11:07.299
You know,
I gotta admit Lindy, uh...

01:11:07.382 --> 01:11:08.524
Right toward the end there I...

01:11:08.548 --> 01:11:10.465
I didn't think you had it in ya.

01:11:10.548 --> 01:11:12.465
So, my apologies.

01:11:12.548 --> 01:11:14.881
I decided to take
care of Fizel myself.

01:11:17.424 --> 01:11:18.465
What are you covered in?

01:11:18.548 --> 01:11:19.840
Is it that time of the month?

01:11:21.382 --> 01:11:22.548
But you...

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:25.798
I saw you. How?

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:26.923
The guy in the casket?

01:11:27.007 --> 01:11:28.923
No.

01:11:29.007 --> 01:11:30.798
Aah, some bum off the street.

01:11:30.881 --> 01:11:32.048
Jesus Christ!

01:11:33.798 --> 01:11:35.516
Yeah, I just paid
off the coroner, you know?

01:11:36.424 --> 01:11:37.590
Why?

01:11:37.673 --> 01:11:39.548
I had to
get Fizel out of the way.

01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:41.798
But the CIA can't
operate on US soil.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.007
Even the government,

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.132
wouldn't be dumb
enough to go after him.

01:11:46.215 --> 01:11:47.881
Exactly.

01:11:47.965 --> 01:11:49.607
Yeah! I needed someone
from the outside, you know?

01:11:49.631 --> 01:11:52.340
Someone to draw
the attention away from myself.

01:11:52.424 --> 01:11:54.923
Someone who couldn't
be traced back to me.

01:11:55.007 --> 01:11:56.340
So you chose me?

01:11:57.048 --> 01:11:58.965
Why?

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.631
A glowing
recommendation from Dr. Munchin.

01:12:01.715 --> 01:12:03.007
I mean, who do you think funds

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.881
his batshit crazy experiments?

01:12:04.965 --> 01:12:06.382
But see, I...

01:12:06.465 --> 01:12:09.215
I knew you
were something else. Yeah.

01:12:09.299 --> 01:12:11.590
My little kamikaze K-9.

01:12:11.673 --> 01:12:13.965
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:12:14.048 --> 01:12:16.840
Well, in the
Second World War, uh...

01:12:16.923 --> 01:12:18.840
they strapped bombs to dogs

01:12:18.923 --> 01:12:21.007
and they would train
them to run into enemy tanks.

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:22.382
Right?

01:12:22.465 --> 01:12:24.275
The puppies thought they were
just gonna get a treat

01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:27.132
or something, but they got
detonated into dog-burger.

01:12:27.215 --> 01:12:28.506
Yeah.

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:30.132
So I just had
to figure out what treats

01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:33.881
I needed to use
to train you to take out Fizel.

01:12:33.965 --> 01:12:35.803
And if you failed or
got killed in the process,

01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:37.673
well, you know? Cost me nothing.

01:12:37.756 --> 01:12:39.673
That's why you were perfect.

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:41.090
Where's my car by the way?

01:12:41.173 --> 01:12:43.590
Who the fuck are you?

01:12:43.673 --> 01:12:44.881
Who am I?

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:47.840
I'm the only one
keeping this old shitbag

01:12:47.923 --> 01:12:49.382
from killing innocent people!

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.631
Fizel was an asset
that became a liability.

01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:52.798
Everybody wanted him dead,

01:12:52.881 --> 01:12:53.923
but nobody can touch him.

01:12:54.798 --> 01:12:57.673
And you think this masochistic

01:12:57.756 --> 01:13:00.965
piece of shit
was ever gonna stop?

01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:05.631
Not so untouchable
anymore, are ya handsome?

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.048
Huh?

01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:09.590
You lowlife piece of shit.

01:13:09.673 --> 01:13:11.548
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:13:11.631 --> 01:13:16.673
You could try. Or
we just... fuck instead.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.007
What? We had fun, right?

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:35.340
I mean,
you did all this for me?

01:13:36.506 --> 01:13:38.590
You must really be into me.

01:13:40.881 --> 01:13:42.631
What the fuck?

01:13:42.715 --> 01:13:44.215
Was that too strong for ya?

01:13:44.299 --> 01:13:47.923
Oh, sorry. I did a bit of
tinkering.

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:50.215
Ow!

01:13:50.299 --> 01:13:52.149
You know what though?
It's gonna turn out to be,

01:13:52.173 --> 01:13:54.173
a really beautiful story, Lindy.

01:13:54.257 --> 01:13:56.048
Desperate, little

01:13:56.132 --> 01:13:58.215
broken princess

01:13:58.299 --> 01:14:01.173
avenges the death
of her lover and then...

01:14:01.257 --> 01:14:02.673
takes her own life.

01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:06.923
Motherfucker!

01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:12.090
Oops.

01:14:15.382 --> 01:14:16.590
You know what's funny?

01:14:16.673 --> 01:14:18.591
I thought you'd be
harder to crack. I really did!

01:14:18.631 --> 01:14:21.299
'Cause you seemed
pretty messed up.

01:14:22.715 --> 01:14:24.840
You know, in... in
an interesting way, but...

01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:26.424
No, you're easy.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.965
Well, it turns out all
you needed was to be fucked.

01:14:59.007 --> 01:15:00.756
You know what?

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.506
It is actually
that time of the month.

01:15:03.424 --> 01:15:05.465
Unlucky for you, fuckface.

01:15:08.756 --> 01:15:10.048
What the fuck is this?

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.007
A parting gift!

01:15:16.715 --> 01:15:17.881
Eat shit!

01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:55.424
I'm sorry.

01:15:55.506 --> 01:15:57.299
- You backstabbing fuck!
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:15:57.382 --> 01:15:59.340
I had no idea what
they were going to do with you.

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:01.965
I'm assuming that both
Justin and Fizel are dead?

01:16:02.048 --> 01:16:03.465
Uh-huh. Guess who's next.

01:16:03.548 --> 01:16:06.299
No, no, no. Wait,
wait. Remember, we set you free.

01:16:06.382 --> 01:16:08.260
Well, yeah I didn't
think your exposure therapy,

01:16:08.299 --> 01:16:09.631
would be quite
so fucking extreme.

01:16:09.715 --> 01:16:11.965
Yeah, but look,
it... it was able to show you

01:16:12.048 --> 01:16:13.506
how extraordinary you are.

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:15.840
You served me up
like a lamb to the slaughter.

01:16:15.923 --> 01:16:17.631
I had no idea!

01:16:17.715 --> 01:16:19.382
But look at you. Lindy.

01:16:20.465 --> 01:16:22.007
You're so special.

01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:23.548
I'm a freak. Are
you gonna shoot me?

01:16:23.631 --> 01:16:24.756
What?

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.983
No, I don't
think so. I don't know...

01:16:26.007 --> 01:16:27.881
- What have you got that for?
- Sorry.

01:16:27.965 --> 01:16:30.340
You're not
a freak. You're magnificent.

01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:32.756
Now, we can
really start to work.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.007
Now.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.774
Think about the things
that we can do together...

01:16:35.798 --> 01:16:38.965
Are you out of
your mind? You betrayed me!

01:16:39.048 --> 01:16:40.899
I helped you more than
anybody else in the world.

01:16:40.923 --> 01:16:41.923
Fuck you!

01:16:52.382 --> 01:16:54.548
- Stop fucking moving.
- Lindy, drop the gun!

01:16:54.631 --> 01:16:56.132
- Hold on!
- You're hurting me!

01:16:56.215 --> 01:16:58.007
- Drop the gun! Okay.
- I'm not done!

01:17:00.465 --> 01:17:02.506
- Ah, fuck! You shot me!
- Fuck.

01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:04.275
Sorry, I thought
you were trying to kill him.

01:17:04.299 --> 01:17:06.257
No, you twat! I was
doing your job for you,

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.506
- again.
- Don't call me twat!

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:09.309
Ivan Marcellus Munchin,
you are under arrest

01:17:09.382 --> 01:17:10.649
for practicing medicine
without a license.

01:17:10.673 --> 01:17:11.756
- Ow!
- All right.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.048
I'm gonna keep pressure on it.

01:17:13.132 --> 01:17:15.090
Take your finger
off my leg hole.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:17.132
Little help?

01:17:18.215 --> 01:17:19.631
And the security guards?

01:17:20.673 --> 01:17:23.173
Uh, self-defense.

01:17:23.257 --> 01:17:26.048
And the incident
with the jumper cables?

01:17:27.424 --> 01:17:28.590
Also self-defense.

01:17:28.673 --> 01:17:30.173
Self-defense.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.631
And the maternity ward?

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:34.132
Mistaken identity.

01:17:36.299 --> 01:17:38.965
What happened
to "living by the rules"?

01:17:39.048 --> 01:17:41.215
Some rules are
better than others.

01:17:41.299 --> 01:17:43.840
What, does this
mean I'm not going to jail?

01:17:43.923 --> 01:17:45.382
You're going to jail.

01:17:45.465 --> 01:17:46.465
You attacked me.

01:17:46.548 --> 01:17:48.881
You drove around
the city like a lunatic,

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:51.340
in a car that costs
more than my yearly pay.

01:17:51.424 --> 01:17:52.756
You're going to jail, sweetie.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.548
I see you out front.

01:17:54.631 --> 01:17:57.798
- And I'll see you in court.
- Look forward to it, Detective.

01:17:57.881 --> 01:17:59.881
This is every day for me.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:08.048
They took it off
you in the ambulance.

01:18:10.506 --> 01:18:11.881
So, what's next?

01:18:11.965 --> 01:18:14.923
Um, I don't know,
I start over I guess.

01:18:15.007 --> 01:18:17.756
Just... no more blind dates.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.548
Hmm, that's
probably a good idea.

01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:22.007
Lots of creeps out there.

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:24.382
I mean, there are...

01:18:24.465 --> 01:18:26.881
some nice guys too.

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:29.424
Yeah.

01:18:35.506 --> 01:18:36.548
Here you go.

01:18:37.382 --> 01:18:39.132
Thank you.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:40.649
I'm not gonna find
a bunch of pictures,

01:18:40.673 --> 01:18:41.872
of your bumhole on this, am I?

01:18:41.923 --> 01:18:43.923
Of my bumhole? No.

01:18:46.382 --> 01:18:48.090
What kind of
sleazeball do you think I am?

01:18:48.173 --> 01:18:50.382
I mean, the kind
that shoots a woman in the leg.

01:18:50.465 --> 01:18:53.506
Yeah.
Well, sorry about that.

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:56.715
Well, you know, I could
always make it up to you.

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:57.881
Dinner sometime?

01:18:59.923 --> 01:19:01.923
Um, I'll...
I'll think about it.

01:19:03.548 --> 01:19:04.798
I'm an excellent cook.

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.548
Double down on the halibut.

01:19:07.631 --> 01:19:09.881
All right, piss off now.

Can I help you?

01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:02.631
I was just
checking it out, you know?

01:21:02.715 --> 01:21:04.465
It looks so
beat up from outside.

01:21:04.548 --> 01:21:05.840
Who are you?

01:21:07.257 --> 01:21:09.215
It's like
a bomb went off in here.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:11.132
Yeah, I had a tricky boiler.

01:21:13.548 --> 01:21:14.756
But why have you come back?

01:21:16.132 --> 01:21:17.424
It's my apartment.

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:19.756
Well, most people,
when their lives blow up,

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.048
would just keep on running.

01:21:22.465 --> 01:21:24.798
It is so nice
that you wanted to come home

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:26.299
to try all over again.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.090
Sorry, do I know you?

01:21:28.173 --> 01:21:30.382
- Have you been following me?
- Yeah.

01:21:30.465 --> 01:21:31.798
What do you actually want?

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:36.506
You are just as
spunky as Munchin described.

01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:38.673
You've done well under our care.

01:21:38.756 --> 01:21:40.548
Okay, I've done
enough messing around,

01:21:40.631 --> 01:21:43.840
with psychotic therapists
and the fucking CIA,

01:21:43.923 --> 01:21:45.673
or whatever you are.

01:21:45.756 --> 01:21:48.548
I totally understand.

01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:52.048
You've spent years being
forced to repress your anger.

01:21:52.132 --> 01:21:53.631
I'm sorry about Justin.

01:21:53.715 --> 01:21:55.715
What he did was unsanctioned.

01:21:55.798 --> 01:21:57.965
But now...

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:00.382
Now Lindy,

01:22:00.465 --> 01:22:02.715
you have seen
how powerful you can be

01:22:02.798 --> 01:22:04.424
when you embrace your rage.

01:22:04.506 --> 01:22:06.465
I'm okay as I am. Thanks.

01:22:06.548 --> 01:22:07.548
Really?

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:10.340
Well, how are you?

01:22:10.424 --> 01:22:12.465
You're not normal.

01:22:12.548 --> 01:22:14.173
You really think you'd be happy,

01:22:14.257 --> 01:22:16.048
living without a purpose?

01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:17.673
Through our work, you'll learn

01:22:17.756 --> 01:22:20.548
to harness your rage
and target the right people.

01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:25.048
Humans, are the most
powerful, undetectable weapon.

01:25:09.382 --> 01:25:10.715
Holy shit!
