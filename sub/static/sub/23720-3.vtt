-[door opens]
-I said I'm fine.

00:43.776 --> 00:45.311
You're not fine, Janelle.

00:45.344 --> 00:48.081
Look, I don't--
I don't have to go.

00:48.114 --> 00:50.416
-We can figure
something else out.
-Don't you dare say that.

00:50.449 --> 00:52.485
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime and I'll be damned

00:52.518 --> 00:55.588
if I let you
just throw it away.

00:55.621 --> 00:58.191
I just don't get it.
So what if I can't freestyle?

00:58.224 --> 01:00.193
It's all choreography.
They teach you a routine

01:00.226 --> 01:02.195
-and you fucking
learn it, right?
-Right.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.531
Anybody could just come in
and do a few moves on a whim,
that's easy.

01:05.564 --> 01:07.467
-Wait, what?
-[exhales]

01:07.500 --> 01:09.202
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:09.235 --> 01:11.504
Even you said,
you're not that ambitious.

01:11.537 --> 01:13.706
I'm just worried you
won't have the fire
to survive there.

01:13.739 --> 01:15.541
-[phone ringing]
-You think I can't
handle High Water?

01:15.574 --> 01:17.777
-I didn't say that.
-Well, I think you just did.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.846
You think I can't handle
fucking art school?

01:19.879 --> 01:22.515
You don't dance every day.
You don't know what it's
like to compete.

01:22.548 --> 01:24.817
Maybe I didn't want to compete.
Did you think about that?

01:24.850 --> 01:27.253
-It doesn't mean that
I can't do it.
-Doesn't mean you can, either.

01:27.286 --> 01:29.155
Why, because I don't walk around
like a psychotic perfectionist?

01:29.188 --> 01:31.257
[Janelle] That's
exactly my point.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.659
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
that I got something
that you always wanted.

01:33.692 --> 01:35.561
Guess you're just gonna
have to live with it.

01:35.594 --> 01:37.830
-No, you are.
-Yeah, thanks for
the support, Janelle.

01:37.863 --> 01:39.799
-Whatever.
-Hey!

01:41.300 --> 01:43.536
Your mother's appeal
didn't go through.

01:43.569 --> 01:47.473
So she's gonna have to do
the full three years.

01:47.506 --> 01:49.709
Yeah. [sighs]

02:06.492 --> 02:08.693
I'm not going back to Garvey,
all right? I can't.

02:08.727 --> 02:10.794
-Oh, okay. [chuckles]
-So I need you to sign this,

02:10.829 --> 02:13.633
and I need you
to do it now, because
the program starts today.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.368
'Cause you're not
going back to Garvey?

02:15.401 --> 02:17.803
I-- I can't go back there.
Please.

02:17.836 --> 02:20.273
You're telling me
what you're not gonna do.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.876
High Water?
I thought I shut this down.

02:24.910 --> 02:27.346
Well, you did, but for her.
I'm asking for me.

02:27.379 --> 02:29.781
I'll go by day and
I'll get my GED by night.

02:29.815 --> 02:32.452
I promise.
Uncle Al, please, I need this.

02:34.486 --> 02:38.658
-Gimme a pen.
-Wait, you're signing that?

02:38.691 --> 02:40.359
The boy needs a win.
Look at his face.

02:40.392 --> 02:41.727
[pen scribbles]

02:41.760 --> 02:43.728
And since you guys think
you're the Wonder Twins,

02:43.762 --> 02:46.199
give me your paperwork.
I might as well sign it now.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.769
-I'm not going.
-What?

02:49.802 --> 02:51.571
I didn't get in.

02:56.408 --> 02:57.976
Shit.

02:58.010 --> 03:01.513
[blender whirring]

03:12.691 --> 03:14.827
[man] Congratulations,
you just made it
into High Water.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.729
Whoo!

03:19.365 --> 03:20.733
There she is.

03:20.766 --> 03:23.435
Here. Drink this
and get dressed.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.638
[sniffs] Mm.
What is it?

03:26.672 --> 03:30.877
Hangover cure, guaranteed
to make you feel 100 percent
better and erase...

03:32.044 --> 03:33.846
You know what?
We gotta go.

03:33.879 --> 03:36.482
Well, hey, what's the rush?
You got a roommate or something?

03:36.515 --> 03:39.285
-[laughs] No, but--
-Good.

03:39.318 --> 03:44.224
Hey... It's our first day,
and I don't want to be late.

03:45.658 --> 03:48.227
Yeah. Me neither.

03:53.565 --> 03:55.368
I like your place.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.336
It's great.

03:57.369 --> 03:58.971
Yeah.

03:59.004 --> 04:01.641
Hey, I can't find
your socks.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.377
Oh, uh...

04:05.744 --> 04:06.946
I kept those on.

04:06.979 --> 04:08.848
[chuckles] Oh, God.

04:12.851 --> 04:14.353
[hip-hop playing]

04:14.386 --> 04:18.324
Ohio! Isn't it a bit
early for you?

04:18.357 --> 04:20.593
Just trying to beat
this heat, man.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.865
So, you've got everybody
and they mama

04:25.898 --> 04:28.668
talkin' about your little
brick through the window
move yesterday.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.770
-[chuckles]
-Proud of you, man.

04:36.008 --> 04:38.578
But... you know you
fucked up, right?

04:40.079 --> 04:44.083
Look, fuck Marquise, all right?
And fuck Garvey, too.

04:44.116 --> 04:46.385
I'm at High Water now,
so it doesn't matter.

04:46.418 --> 04:47.887
I'm not gonna see
that asshole anymore.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.723
Hmm. You think
a guy like Marquise

04:50.756 --> 04:52.592
gives a damn whose
property you're on?

04:54.393 --> 04:56.361
Right.

04:59.665 --> 05:02.702
Look, this'll blow over
eventually, all right?

05:02.735 --> 05:06.706
But until then, I need you
to keep a low profile.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.508
All right?

05:10.642 --> 05:12.378
Come on.

05:12.411 --> 05:15.748
-Come on, what?
-I'm giving you a ride.

05:15.781 --> 05:18.884
You're walking to school
in that coat...

05:18.917 --> 05:22.354
-is like a walking
neon &quot;shoot me&quot; sign.
-[chuckles]

05:22.388 --> 05:25.390
I think you mean &quot;kick me,&quot;
because that's what
they usually--

05:25.424 --> 05:26.993
[car starts]

05:35.000 --> 05:36.235
Haven't you ever wanted
something so much

05:36.268 --> 05:38.938
that you knew that you
had to go for it no matter
what it took,

05:38.971 --> 05:42.441
because that thing
was gonna change your
life forever?

05:42.474 --> 05:44.409
[sighs] No.

05:47.146 --> 05:50.049
Look, I know I'm supposed
to say somethin' about,
&quot;This is life,&quot;

05:50.082 --> 05:52.551
and you know, &quot;Things
don't always work out,&quot;

05:52.584 --> 05:54.987
or &quot;Everything's
not meant to be.&quot;

05:55.020 --> 05:56.856
No, but this was meant to be.

05:56.889 --> 06:00.659
I was gonna get in until
they screwed me over.

06:00.692 --> 06:03.596
-They screwed you over.
-Yes, I was set up.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.030
Somebody messed with my music.

06:05.063 --> 06:06.899
They set you up.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.371
-And you know who this was?
-A hundred percent.

06:13.105 --> 06:15.574
[sighs]

06:15.607 --> 06:17.777
Then there's only
one thing to do.

06:17.810 --> 06:21.414
You gotta go down there
and demand a second chance.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.049
-Really?
-Absolutely.

06:24.082 --> 06:26.786
Or I could do it.
I mean, I'd go there right now.

06:26.819 --> 06:27.987
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.688
-I got it.
-Why don't you change clothes?

06:29.721 --> 06:31.624
-[scoffs]
-Hey.

06:33.625 --> 06:35.728
Don't ever lie to me again.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.970
-I'm sorry you think someone--
-No, I don't think, I know.

06:45.003 --> 06:46.104
They were practically
bragging about it.

06:46.138 --> 06:47.705
And we'll look
into it, but...

06:47.739 --> 06:50.909
-my decision still stands.
-But--

06:50.943 --> 06:54.746
That's-- That's it?
I just told you what happened.
That's all you can say?

06:54.780 --> 06:57.215
-Unfortunately, yes.
-But that's not fair.

06:57.249 --> 06:59.652
[takes deep breath]

06:59.685 --> 07:02.855
Look, no disrespect,
but I would like
to speak to Sage.

07:02.888 --> 07:06.959
Dancer to dancer, I think he'd
be a little more sensitive.

07:06.992 --> 07:11.063
For your information,
at your age, I was dancing
and singing, too.

07:12.531 --> 07:14.133
Only professionally.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.101
Well, I-- I didn't know.

07:16.134 --> 07:17.903
Dancer to dancer, Janelle,
you're very good.

07:17.936 --> 07:19.572
And if you keep
working at it,

07:19.605 --> 07:21.607
maybe one day
you'll be great.
Who knows?

07:21.640 --> 07:25.077
But right now, I see someone
who wants to make it as a dancer

07:25.110 --> 07:27.646
more than you actually want
to express yourself as a dancer,

07:27.679 --> 07:29.914
and there's a huge difference
between the two.

07:29.948 --> 07:32.784
So you have more
ambition than soul.

07:34.686 --> 07:36.955
And when the two can catch up
with each other,

07:36.989 --> 07:38.556
you'll probably go a long way,

07:38.590 --> 07:41.460
but for right now,
that is all I can say.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.465
Good luck.

07:55.674 --> 07:57.943
And really look out
for each other, okay?

07:57.976 --> 08:00.279
'Cause just like Rigo, King,
and Poppy came after me,

08:00.312 --> 08:02.882
they're probably
gonna come after you guys, too.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.283
I was just their first target.

08:04.316 --> 08:06.919
-That's so fucked up.
-Nah, that's beyond fucked up.

08:06.952 --> 08:08.854
You don't mess with another
guy's livelihood.

08:08.887 --> 08:10.723
Anybody trying to get in the way
of what we're doing here

08:10.756 --> 08:12.625
is gonna learn real quick.

08:19.698 --> 08:24.870
Hey, before you go,
could we talk for a second?

08:24.903 --> 08:27.006
I've got a session on
the other side of the building,

08:27.039 --> 08:30.009
and I've really gotta go.
But... we'll catch up.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.144
-I promise.
-Yeah.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.682
Yeah.

08:40.251 --> 08:44.121
[cell phone ringing]

08:48.193 --> 08:51.864
-[desk phone ringing]
-[sighs]

08:52.898 --> 08:54.833
Collette Jones.

08:54.866 --> 08:57.670
I'm not answering
your calls for a reason, okay?

08:57.703 --> 09:00.139
Do not call me again.
We will talk later.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.007
I gotta go. Bye.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.742
You want to tell me
who the fuck let East-O's kid
in my school?

09:04.776 --> 09:06.978
I did.
Is there a problem?

09:07.012 --> 09:10.148
Is there a prob--
You know good and goddamn
well there's a fucking problem.

09:10.182 --> 09:13.085
East-O's kid? Come on!
East-O's a fucking lunatic

09:13.118 --> 09:15.321
and I don't want him
anywhere near me
or nothing I'm doing.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.591
Well, East-O is not a
student at this school,
his son is.

09:18.624 --> 09:19.959
'Lette, look,
I'm not playing, all right?

09:19.992 --> 09:22.694
Rigo's one of the most talented
kids in this city.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.762
But you wouldn't know that
because you haven't been
around here

09:24.796 --> 09:26.799
since the fucking
groundbreaking ceremony.

09:26.832 --> 09:29.168
Well, I'm here now,
and I want his ass gone.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.638
-Make it happen.
-Oh, okay.

09:32.671 --> 09:36.141
You put me in charge,
and we decided that I
was going to be making

09:36.174 --> 09:37.977
all the decisions
for this school.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.280
So unless there is
a real reason

09:41.313 --> 09:45.150
why he should go,
Rigo stays.

09:45.183 --> 09:47.819
[woman] That was the craziest
audition I've ever seen.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.021
Like, where the hell
were his shoes?

09:50.055 --> 09:51.757
[Rigo]
Yeah, but on the real, yo,

09:51.790 --> 09:54.259
it was just all way
too emotional for me, man.

09:54.292 --> 09:57.863
[laughs] The way him and his
sister was getting pulled
apart from each other...

09:57.896 --> 09:59.164
[woman] That was
so hard to watch.

09:59.197 --> 10:01.166
Yeah, don't get it twisted.

10:01.199 --> 10:03.168
Dude danced his ass off
yesterday.

10:03.201 --> 10:05.004
Whatever.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.874
What you looking at, bruh?

10:11.276 --> 10:13.145
[scoffs] Yo, I swear, yo,

10:13.178 --> 10:16.215
nothing but weirdos
in this bitch, man.

10:17.282 --> 10:18.751
[Rigo groans]

10:18.784 --> 10:20.819
What's up, everybody?
How y'all doin'?

10:20.852 --> 10:23.188
Come on, basic warm up.
Let's get into it right away.

10:23.221 --> 10:25.791
-[hip-hop playing]
-I want to see some good energy.

10:25.824 --> 10:28.761
And focus.
You know how I like it.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.896
Stay loose!

10:30.929 --> 10:32.898
[hip-hop playing]

10:32.931 --> 10:35.101
Hey! Hey!

10:36.935 --> 10:38.871
[shouting encouragement]

10:38.904 --> 10:39.939
Back it up!

10:41.373 --> 10:43.308
Movin' right, and...

10:43.341 --> 10:45.110
Double!

10:45.143 --> 10:46.879
Hey! Come on, man!

10:46.912 --> 10:48.047
Catch it up, let's go!

10:49.448 --> 10:50.816
Move up!

10:52.150 --> 10:54.185
Break it down, brother!

10:54.219 --> 10:55.821
Come on!

10:55.854 --> 10:57.056
Hands up!

10:57.089 --> 10:58.924
Hey!

10:58.957 --> 11:01.160
Up!
And down!

11:01.193 --> 11:02.361
Hey!

11:02.394 --> 11:04.797
Come on, man!
Go get it!

11:04.830 --> 11:07.232
That's it! That's it!

11:07.265 --> 11:09.335
Let's see the freestyle,
y'all, come on!

11:11.069 --> 11:12.371
Hah!

11:12.404 --> 11:14.740
Here we go!
Come on, I see ya.

11:16.441 --> 11:18.844
Now nail it!
That's it.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.181
All right, precious,
I like it!

11:22.214 --> 11:25.317
Come on! Whoo!

11:27.886 --> 11:30.255
[all cheering]

11:30.288 --> 11:33.258
You got it, girl, come on!

11:33.291 --> 11:35.360
Come on, man,
get in there!
Let's go!

11:35.393 --> 11:36.996
It's a good time.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.235
Come on, man, come on!

11:43.268 --> 11:46.071
Come on, y'all!
Back up.

11:46.104 --> 11:48.340
Come on! Hah! Hah!

11:48.373 --> 11:50.309
Hip up!

11:57.115 --> 12:00.786
So you're saying you know
nothing of a corrupted track?

12:00.819 --> 12:03.856
What happened between you
and Janelle was just
a coincidence?

12:03.889 --> 12:07.426
Absolutely. I mean,
Rigo and King are
a lot of things,

12:07.459 --> 12:09.895
but evil geniuses
isn't one of them.

12:09.928 --> 12:13.532
Okay. Well, that's good
to know, because contrary
to popular belief,

12:13.565 --> 12:15.400
no one is above
the law here.

12:15.433 --> 12:17.236
You ain't gotta
tell me that.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.971
And this wouldn't
have anything to do

12:19.004 --> 12:21.774
with your most recent
breakup with Rigo?

12:21.807 --> 12:24.409
What, you didn't
think I'd know?

12:24.442 --> 12:27.279
[scoffs] Nah, there's no drama.
She messed up the freestyle.

12:27.312 --> 12:30.149
-Simple as that.
-Good.

12:30.182 --> 12:36.188
I'd hate to think that you
would sabotage another
woman over boy drama.

12:36.221 --> 12:39.224
Don't let your loyalty
to Rigo become a liability.

12:39.257 --> 12:40.925
Meaning...?

12:40.959 --> 12:44.295
Meaning I think you need
to rely on your own power.

12:46.164 --> 12:49.168
I told you I coulda handled it.
That was some stupid shit, Rigo.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.303
I did it for you.
Why are you tripping?

12:51.336 --> 12:53.972
Yeah, well now your little
stunt's got Collette looking
at me all cross-eyed.

12:54.005 --> 12:56.341
Who cares what she thinks?
I'm dancing for Sage now.

12:56.374 --> 12:58.243
That means there's nothing
for us to worry about.

12:58.276 --> 13:00.945
Sage paid attention
to you for five minutes,
so don't get cocky.

13:00.979 --> 13:02.881
And did you see Davis
and Odalie?

13:02.914 --> 13:04.183
They ain't playin' no games.

13:04.216 --> 13:06.351
And you saw what that
crazy kid did yesterday.

13:06.384 --> 13:10.455
Bruh, I just said I'm dancing
for the man who founded
the damn school,

13:10.488 --> 13:13.025
and you're worried
about some randoms?
Are you serious right now?

13:13.058 --> 13:14.960
Yo, what the fuck
is your problem?!

13:14.993 --> 13:16.562
You're my fucki''
problem, bitch.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.163
-What?!
-You heard what
the fuck I said.

13:18.196 --> 13:20.432
You know what? If you
ever try to set me up

13:20.465 --> 13:23.168
the way you did Janelle,
I swear to God I'll
break your fuckin' neck.

13:23.201 --> 13:24.536
-Man, I'll beat your ass up!
-Hey!

13:24.569 --> 13:27.104
-What? What?
-Calm down.

13:27.138 --> 13:30.442
-[Sage on PA]
Ladies and gentlemen...
-[woman] Sage is here.

13:30.475 --> 13:32.311
If you could kindly
make your way

13:32.344 --> 13:36.048
to the main hallway
immediately, thank you
very much.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.883
[all chattering]

13:37.916 --> 13:40.485
First and foremost, I'd like
to thank you all for coming out.

13:40.518 --> 13:44.089
I understand how
incredibly busy you are,
so I will make this brief.

13:44.122 --> 13:47.526
It would appear that
there's been some speculation

13:47.559 --> 13:50.094
as to why I've come back.

13:50.128 --> 13:53.465
I've even been told that some
people have issue with the
fact that I've come back.

13:53.498 --> 13:57.169
And to those people, I say
kiss my entire black ass.

13:57.202 --> 14:00.172
-[laughter]
-That is not the announcement.

14:00.205 --> 14:02.474
The real reason that I
brought you all here today,

14:02.507 --> 14:05.077
the reason that I called
this press conference,

14:05.110 --> 14:08.580
is to let the entire
world know...

14:08.613 --> 14:11.383
...that I'll be starting
a brand-new tour for the summer.

14:11.416 --> 14:13.418
-[students murmuring]
-All new music.

14:13.451 --> 14:15.888
And High Water will be
the headquarters

14:15.921 --> 14:17.956
of the entire
fucking thing.

14:17.989 --> 14:22.027
[cheers, applause]

14:22.060 --> 14:24.963
That's right! Any questions?

14:24.996 --> 14:26.999
-[clamoring]
-Go.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.002
Melissa Knowles, HLN.
How many cities?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.504
Mm, details are currently
being ironed out. Next question.

14:32.537 --> 14:35.607
-[clamoring]
-[Knowles] Will there
be any opportunities

14:35.640 --> 14:38.644
for any of the students
to join the tour at some point?

14:38.677 --> 14:41.380
[camera shutter clicking]

14:43.615 --> 14:45.417
Good question, good question.

14:45.450 --> 14:49.154
Yes, there will be
an opportunity for some
students to join me.

14:49.187 --> 14:52.624
Now, students that show me
that they can be professional,
will be treated--

14:52.657 --> 14:56.094
not to mention compensated--
as professionals.

14:56.127 --> 14:58.563
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd love to sit and chat,
but I have work to do.

14:58.596 --> 15:00.666
-Thank you so much for you time.
-[applause, cheers]

15:00.699 --> 15:02.067
See you on the road.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.936
[applause continues]

15:03.969 --> 15:05.504
-[woman clears throat]
-Okay.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.406
You got all that, right?
Okay, so tomorrow--

15:07.439 --> 15:10.409
Excuse us for a second.
Thank you.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.945
-A tour? A tour.
-Uh-huh.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.646
And all new music?
Sage, there's no new music.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.415
Then I will make
some new music.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.584
It's all coming back to me.
Okay? Don't worry about it.

15:19.617 --> 15:21.053
Listen, if I say
there's gonna be a tour,

15:21.086 --> 15:23.522
-there's gonna be a tour.
-It's that easy?

15:23.555 --> 15:27.291
No, it's not that easy.
But I'm me, Sage Odom.

15:27.325 --> 15:30.228
Check's already cut.
Fix your face, okay?

15:30.261 --> 15:31.997
This is what High Water's
about, right?

15:33.298 --> 15:35.734
-Let's go.
-[woman clears throat]

15:35.767 --> 15:38.637
[footsteps receding]

15:40.338 --> 15:41.640
[doorbell rings]

15:45.744 --> 15:48.680
Hey. Thank your mom for dinner.
Tell her it was great.

15:48.713 --> 15:50.348
-Appreciate it.
-Yeah.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.151
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
Slow down.

15:54.753 --> 15:58.023
Want to ask you if you want to
come to my party tomorrow night.

15:58.056 --> 15:59.591
It'll take your mind
off some things.

15:59.624 --> 16:01.660
Sorry. Thank you, but
I'm not really in the mood.

16:01.693 --> 16:03.627
I gotta figure out what I'm
gonna do, otherwise Uncle Al's

16:03.661 --> 16:06.397
gonna have me back at Garvey,
flipping wings.

16:06.431 --> 16:08.633
Okay, so you
don't flip wings.

16:08.666 --> 16:10.702
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

16:10.735 --> 16:13.372
Hey, you do realize
I don't just go around
inviting any ol' girl

16:13.405 --> 16:15.273
-to come party with me, right?
-Yes, you do.

16:15.306 --> 16:17.676
You throw parties for a living.
You invite girls all the time.

16:17.709 --> 16:20.444
Point taken, but I've never
offered to take a girl with me

16:20.478 --> 16:22.781
as my quote-unquote
&quot;plus one&quot; before.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.683
It's a pretty monumental moment
in Black History

16:24.716 --> 16:27.185
-that you're kind of
shittin' on right now.
-[laughing]

16:27.218 --> 16:28.652
-I think I'm a little offended.
-Really?

16:28.686 --> 16:31.490
Yeah. So what's
it gonna be?

16:33.591 --> 16:36.328
Dondre, I know that
your parties are super fun,
but I just...

16:36.361 --> 16:39.331
-Just what?
-[Al] Chit-chat's over.

16:39.364 --> 16:41.700
unless you wanna come
with me and fry some chicken.

16:41.733 --> 16:44.703
Nah, I gotta...
catch up on my soaps.

16:44.736 --> 16:47.006
-[Janelle laughs]
-Uh-huh.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.775
That's why
I never had kids.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.244
-No return on your investment.
-[Dondre chuckles]

16:52.277 --> 16:54.246
Let's go,
let's ride.

16:54.279 --> 16:57.616
Tell your mama
I don't eat pumpkin pie.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.319
-That was casserole.
-Yeah, whatever.

17:09.527 --> 17:12.329
[Collette] It's just a little
blip until I can figure out

17:12.363 --> 17:14.366
where I'm gonna
pull the money from, all right?

17:14.397 --> 17:16.435
I'll have some answers shortly.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.770
Okay, thank you.

17:19.804 --> 17:21.507
So, how's the expansion?

17:24.509 --> 17:26.377
Atlanta's a small town.

17:26.411 --> 17:28.280
I'm not really here
for small talk, okay?

17:28.313 --> 17:31.717
I can see. I mean,
we out here in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.120
You trying to kill me
or something?

17:35.153 --> 17:39.091
I've asked you
plain and simple
to stop calling.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.693
So now I'm here,
talking to you face to face.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.795
Our little thing,
we can't keep doing it, okay?

17:43.828 --> 17:46.498
-It's done.
-Is that what you call it?

17:46.531 --> 17:48.267
&quot;Little thing&quot;?

17:49.901 --> 17:52.304
You are so beautiful.

17:55.206 --> 17:57.208
You know what?
[chuckles]

17:57.242 --> 17:59.711
You know what? I--
I'm actually serious.

17:59.744 --> 18:04.416
I am. Uh, Sage is back in town
and so we can't keep doing this.

18:04.449 --> 18:07.786
So it's like that?
Are you serious?

18:07.819 --> 18:11.156
Sage comes back and
everything is over between us?

18:11.189 --> 18:13.125
I'm the one
that carried you
when you fucked up your knee.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.493
Where the hell was he?

18:14.526 --> 18:16.228
The tour had
to keep moving.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.164
The tour? He blew up
and he forgot all about us.

18:19.197 --> 18:22.133
Sage made up for it.
He gave me High Water.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.337
He just using you up,
until you got nothing else.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.539
Okay, not going--
Not doing this.

18:27.572 --> 18:29.707
Wait wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

18:29.741 --> 18:33.645
Did you not just hear what
the fuck I said to you? Move!

18:35.613 --> 18:37.549
Fucking move!

18:45.890 --> 18:48.227
[car engine starts]

18:49.694 --> 18:52.630
[McCoy] Now, I know you're
all buzzing about the news.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.433
But I need for you to
understand that touring

18:55.466 --> 18:58.270
is more than just
about one person.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.472
It's about us being
a part of a unit.

19:00.505 --> 19:02.474
Do you understand
what I mean? A unit.

19:02.507 --> 19:05.243
So for this assignment,
what I need for you to do

19:05.276 --> 19:09.247
is form groups of two or more
and choreograph a routine

19:09.280 --> 19:13.318
that demonstrates
the power of teamwork.

19:13.351 --> 19:15.287
Pick your partners.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.354
[students murmuring]

19:16.387 --> 19:17.856
So you wanna do this?

19:17.889 --> 19:19.858
Yeah.

19:19.891 --> 19:21.860
Hey, you got--

19:23.761 --> 19:26.364
Hi. Hey, you, uh...

19:26.397 --> 19:27.966
Oh, you-- you already
have a group.

19:27.999 --> 19:29.868
-Yeah, I already
got a partner.
-Cool.

19:29.901 --> 19:31.536
You just don't
get it, do you?

19:31.569 --> 19:33.938
Nobody wants to dance with you
because everybody knows

19:33.972 --> 19:38.243
the way you got in here
was straight bullshit, dawg.
I said it.

19:38.276 --> 19:41.213
You didn't do none of the work,
you're not from around here.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.348
You ain't nothing
but a whack-ass dancer
just like your sister, yo.

19:43.381 --> 19:44.749
Fuck up outta here.

19:44.782 --> 19:47.351
Oh yeah, if she's so whack,

19:47.385 --> 19:48.920
then why'd you go out
of your way to keep her out?

19:48.953 --> 19:50.622
-Yo, don't play with me--
-Yeah, whatever.

19:50.655 --> 19:52.591
Just let it go.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.677
Ladies, ladies.

20:21.019 --> 20:25.724
So if we do four--
two in each corner--
and you have four looking up--

20:25.757 --> 20:28.827
-I came as soon
as I got your text.
-Know what I mean?

20:28.860 --> 20:31.495
I can't tell you how excited
I am to work with you.

20:31.529 --> 20:34.266
Time for ass-kissing
has come and gone, young one.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.033
I'mma call you so we could
finish this, aight?

20:36.067 --> 20:39.037
So, got any stories about
my dad from back in the day?

20:39.070 --> 20:42.407
Did he really get
all the ladies like he says?
You know how he is.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.876
Truth be told, me and your daddy
weren't that tight. [grunts]

20:44.909 --> 20:46.811
But like you said,
&quot;You know how he is.&quot;

20:46.844 --> 20:48.647
-You got the steps I sent you?
-Yeah.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.315
-You studied 'em?
-Yeah.

20:50.348 --> 20:54.619
-Show me.
-[hip-hop playing]

20:54.652 --> 20:57.923
Five, six...
Five, six, seven, and...

21:10.568 --> 21:12.837
Yeah?
Come on. Ready?

21:12.870 --> 21:14.639
Five, six, seven, and...

21:14.672 --> 21:15.774
Boom!

21:15.807 --> 21:18.710
Bam. Hey, yo, explode.

21:23.047 --> 21:24.383
Take it.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.620
Slide. Stop, all right. Stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

21:28.653 --> 21:29.854
You said you studied it.

21:29.887 --> 21:31.755
-You told me you studied it.
-Yeah.

21:31.789 --> 21:33.692
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna add a little
wrinkle right here.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.060
Okay, so when
we get here-- boom.

21:35.093 --> 21:37.529
Here, from this slide,

21:37.562 --> 21:38.996
throw out a chest
right here-- boom.

21:39.030 --> 21:43.535
Bring it down, over,
on the toe.

21:43.568 --> 21:44.936
Pull the shirt.
[whooshes]

21:44.969 --> 21:47.872
Come on.
Five, six, seven, boom!

21:47.905 --> 21:49.607
-Come on, man!
-I got it. I got it.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.877
Five, six, seven, and...

21:53.044 --> 21:55.314
Big arms, big arms!

21:57.014 --> 21:59.784
[quiet, mellow music playing]

22:04.555 --> 22:06.758
Five, six, seven...

22:25.109 --> 22:26.812
Okay, what's the problem?

22:29.881 --> 22:31.783
-[sighs]
-Nothing, okay? I got it.

22:33.151 --> 22:35.620
You can't let that kid
get to you like this.

22:35.653 --> 22:38.056
-We've gotta focus.
-Look, I know that, all right?

22:38.089 --> 22:39.491
I've just got a lot
of shit on my mind.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.158
Well, get over it.

22:41.192 --> 22:43.495
Fine.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.463
You ready to address
the elephant in the room?

22:45.496 --> 22:47.566
Okay, fine.
We'll have the damn talk.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.771
-Last night was--
-The most fun I had
in a long time.

22:52.804 --> 22:54.539
That's why
it can't happen again.

22:56.507 --> 22:59.677
Mira, mamita, I swear
you're amazing, all right?

22:59.710 --> 23:03.715
And under normal circumstances,
I swear, I'd be pursuing
the hell out of this, but...

23:03.748 --> 23:05.817
Look, my life
is way too crazy to be

23:05.850 --> 23:08.453
getting caught up in any
extracurricular right now.

23:08.486 --> 23:11.990
-I understand.
-No, you don't.

23:14.892 --> 23:17.129
Look, I'm gonna just be
real with you, okay?

23:19.497 --> 23:22.434
I'm homeless right now,
and I get money whenever I can.

23:22.467 --> 23:26.204
Plus, I got a little brother
in foster care that I'm
really trying to get custody of,

23:26.237 --> 23:30.442
so I guess you could say
I'm really kinda going through
a lot of shit right now.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.644
That's the reason why
I got so mad at Rigo, okay?
I'm sorry.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.679
No, uh...
My God, Davis, I'm sorry.

23:35.713 --> 23:38.983
-I didn't know. I promise--
-No, it's cool, 'cause...

23:39.016 --> 23:40.985
you know, then this whole
High Water thing happened,

23:41.018 --> 23:43.655
and then Sage
makes this announcement.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.790
I mean, this
could be my answer.

23:45.823 --> 23:48.026
If I make this tour this summer,
I could stack some paper,

23:48.059 --> 23:50.562
I could get my own place
and my little brother
could live with me.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.665
You're the best dancer here.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.100
That's why I need us to keep it
strictly professional,

23:56.133 --> 23:58.103
so you could make
that happen for me.

23:59.637 --> 24:01.505
Okay, uh...
I'll do whatever I can.

24:01.539 --> 24:04.075
Thank you.

24:04.108 --> 24:06.811
Look, and I promise you,
as soon as we make this happen,

24:06.844 --> 24:09.247
you'll be our first
house guest, okay?

24:09.280 --> 24:11.081
[chuckles]

24:11.115 --> 24:12.984
That's on my pinky shit.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.523
All right, now that
we got the air clear...

24:22.059 --> 24:23.194
...let's smash this routine.

24:23.227 --> 24:25.464
Five, six, seven, and...

24:26.898 --> 24:28.832
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

24:28.866 --> 24:31.703
Levels, all right?
Don't ever give 'em
the same energy twice.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.771
All right, if I can see it
coming, it's wrong.

24:33.804 --> 24:35.607
Say, it. &quot;If I see it coming,
it's wrong.&quot;

24:35.640 --> 24:38.643
-If I see it coming, it's wrong.
-Five, six, seven, and...

24:40.244 --> 24:42.146
Stop, man!
Now you're telegraphing.

24:42.179 --> 24:43.748
Come on, you do
that shit on stage,

24:43.781 --> 24:45.049
people gonna demand
they fucking money back.

24:45.082 --> 24:46.584
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

24:46.617 --> 24:47.886
-Then say something.
Can you hear me?
-Yes.

24:47.919 --> 24:49.521
I shouldn't see the next
move coming, right?

24:49.554 --> 24:51.923
Five, six, seven, and boom!

24:51.956 --> 24:54.525
Don't-- don't telegraph
that shit. Stop!

24:54.559 --> 24:57.896
Stop, stop!
Are you here to waste my time?

24:57.929 --> 24:59.731
-No.
-I don't got better shit
to do than this?

24:59.764 --> 25:01.265
-Yes.
-You wanna be a icon, right?

25:01.299 --> 25:02.934
-Yes.
-Do you wanna be a icon?

25:02.967 --> 25:04.302
-Yes.
-Then show me, goddamnit!

25:04.335 --> 25:06.204
Five, six, seven, and--

25:06.237 --> 25:08.206
Uh-oh, somebody looks tired.

25:08.239 --> 25:10.675
Are we tired?
Icons don't get tired.

25:10.708 --> 25:11.943
You think I'm gonna
let you be tired?

25:11.976 --> 25:14.212
Hell no, you ready?
Are you ready?

25:14.245 --> 25:17.314
Five, six, seven--
Next, let's go.

25:17.348 --> 25:19.651
You're embarrassing yourself
and wasting my time.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.653
Sloppy. Real sloppy.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.588
Come on, man, levels!

25:23.621 --> 25:26.224
All right, that's
enough for today, Rigo,
you can go home.

25:33.064 --> 25:34.999
[music stops]

25:35.032 --> 25:36.835
I expect better tomorrow.

25:42.974 --> 25:44.943
-What the hell was that?
-Just testing the kid.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.210
He's all that. He's supposed
to be able to handle it, right?

25:46.243 --> 25:48.745
Okay, that's bullshit
and you know it.

25:48.779 --> 25:50.848
All right, so how about this?

25:50.881 --> 25:52.984
If I can't kick him out,
I'll make him quit.

25:53.017 --> 25:55.019
[Collette]
What is wrong with you?

25:55.052 --> 25:57.221
We're supposed to be building
these kids up.

25:57.254 --> 25:59.657
There's kids here
that need our help

25:59.690 --> 26:01.859
and there's kids and
parents here that ain't gonna
be nothing but trouble for us.

26:01.892 --> 26:05.096
-Sage--
-You don't know how
dangerous East-O really is.

26:05.129 --> 26:06.965
He could come in here and
destroy everything I've built

26:06.998 --> 26:09.667
-and I'm not fucking
having that.
-Got it. I got it.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.970
But listen, whatever
your beef is with him,

26:12.003 --> 26:13.772
you can't take it out
on his kid.

26:14.972 --> 26:17.742
You want East-O gone? Fine.
Find another way.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.015
[door opens, shuts]

26:24.048 --> 26:26.785
[hip-hop playing on TV]

26:30.354 --> 26:31.155
Damn it.

26:34.392 --> 26:37.662
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, is Tal here?

26:38.763 --> 26:39.831
Um, no.

26:45.403 --> 26:47.038
I'll wait.

26:50.107 --> 26:53.110
Uh, you know what,
actually I don't think Tal
is coming in at all today,

26:53.144 --> 26:54.879
so can I help you
with something?

26:54.912 --> 26:56.648
You must be the twin.

26:58.215 --> 27:00.885
What's up, shorty?
My name is Marquise.

27:02.853 --> 27:06.124
That crazy muthafucka that
beat your brother's face in.

27:06.157 --> 27:07.891
It's nice to meet you.

27:09.193 --> 27:12.664
[scoffs]

27:12.697 --> 27:16.234
All right, you tell that
bitch boy you don't just trash
my car and walk away.

27:16.267 --> 27:19.170
Me and him, long
fuckin' way from done.

27:19.203 --> 27:21.372
I'm not sure what he did
or what you're talking about,

27:21.405 --> 27:24.274
-but I'll pay for the damages.
-Man, fuck them damages!

27:24.308 --> 27:26.811
This ain't
about the money.

27:26.844 --> 27:29.748
Me and him squarin'
this shit face-to-face,
you feel me?

27:30.781 --> 27:32.050
Hmm?

27:32.983 --> 27:34.318
[gasps]

27:34.351 --> 27:38.389
Then again, you're
the sister, right?

27:38.422 --> 27:39.891
Maybe you'll do.

27:39.924 --> 27:42.460
My bad, my bad,
Janelle, sorry I'm late.

27:42.493 --> 27:44.696
Take your break now.

27:44.729 --> 27:47.899
Hey, my man, you good?
You good? Can we take
your order or something?

27:47.932 --> 27:49.067
Man, I'm straight, dawg.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.403
-Thank you.
-All right, cool.

27:52.269 --> 27:54.272
I'mma see you later, twin.

27:56.941 --> 27:59.243
[door opens]

27:59.276 --> 28:01.446
I don't know this guy, Tal,
but he was serious, okay?

28:01.479 --> 28:03.748
-I was scared for my life.
-Well, I don't know
what to do, okay?

28:03.781 --> 28:05.216
Dondre said to just lay low
and wait it out.

28:05.249 --> 28:07.185
I don't care what Dondre said.
We can't just wait it out.

28:07.218 --> 28:08.319
We've gotta call
the police, or--

28:08.352 --> 28:10.121
-[window shatters]
-[both cry out]

28:10.154 --> 28:11.756
[panting]

28:11.789 --> 28:13.357
The fuck was that?

28:13.390 --> 28:16.027
[tires peeling out]

28:19.029 --> 28:21.399
[Tal] Shit.
I think they're gone.

28:21.432 --> 28:23.201
[sighs] Oh, fuck.

28:31.008 --> 28:33.078
Look, let's just
get this shit cleaned up.

28:35.412 --> 28:36.781
-[pounding on door]
-[gasps]

28:36.814 --> 28:37.915
[Dondre] Open up.
It's Dondre.

28:37.948 --> 28:39.217
[Janelle exhales]

28:39.250 --> 28:41.252
[continues pounding]

28:42.219 --> 28:43.321
Everything okay?

28:45.890 --> 28:48.926
-What happened?
-This guy Marquise threw
a fuckin' brick through--

28:48.959 --> 28:50.461
Wait, wait, wait, Marquise?

28:50.494 --> 28:52.129
Yeah, he came to Wings
and Wangs earlier

28:52.163 --> 28:54.065
threatening me 'cause
some shit Tal did.

28:54.098 --> 28:56.134
-Fuck.
-I just don't know what to do.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.069
No, it's okay. You don't have
to do nothing. Come here.

28:58.102 --> 29:01.038
You don't have to
do anything.

29:01.071 --> 29:03.908
We'll figure this out, okay?

29:03.941 --> 29:06.277
[sighs]

29:06.310 --> 29:09.914
Think I got something
in the garage to patch that up,
all right?

29:09.947 --> 29:11.215
-You good?
-Yeah.

29:11.248 --> 29:12.517
All right.

29:19.256 --> 29:23.094
So, uh, what was that
all about?

29:23.127 --> 29:25.296
-What was what?
-You and Dondre.

29:25.329 --> 29:27.498
What, are you
like a thing now?

29:27.531 --> 29:30.101
Uh, is that really what you
wanna talk about right now?

29:30.134 --> 29:31.903
No, no, I'm just saying.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.204
But, I mean, if you
don't like him,

29:33.237 --> 29:34.505
probably don't lead him on.

29:34.538 --> 29:36.240
It's not really fair,
you know?

29:36.273 --> 29:38.442
Fair to who?
Him or you?

29:38.475 --> 29:41.245
-[chuckles] Does it matter?
-Are you serious?

29:41.278 --> 29:43.014
You're the one who got
into High Water.

29:43.047 --> 29:45.349
You're the one who gets to dance
every day and live my dream.

29:45.382 --> 29:48.019
You've got my life.
And now you want Dondre, too?

29:48.052 --> 29:49.887
He's not even gay!

29:49.920 --> 29:51.889
For your information, no.

29:51.922 --> 29:53.391
No, I don't want any of that.

29:53.424 --> 29:55.091
I don't want Mom
to be in jail.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.128
I don't want to be here,
and I don't want to be
at a school

29:57.161 --> 29:59.197
where I fail every minute
of the fucking day.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.266
No, Janelle,
I don't want that.

30:09.473 --> 30:10.841
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

30:10.875 --> 30:12.844
That school is lucky
to have you.

30:12.877 --> 30:15.980
-Yeah, whatever.
-No, I'm serious. Hey...

30:16.013 --> 30:19.417
You just started doing hip-hop
and you're really good.

30:19.450 --> 30:23.354
Okay? And not just that,
but you can write, you can draw,

30:23.387 --> 30:26.624
-you're ridiculously talented.
-[light chuckle]

30:26.657 --> 30:28.993
Look, you've got to get
your ass back in there tomorrow

30:29.026 --> 30:30.528
and show them what
you're made of, okay?

30:30.561 --> 30:34.130
You took my spot.
You owe me that.

30:34.164 --> 30:37.168
-Okay?
-All right.

30:37.201 --> 30:40.304
All right, and if you go
back tomorrow, you do that
and you still want to quit?

30:40.337 --> 30:44.208
-Then I'll kick
your ass again.
-[laughs]

30:44.241 --> 30:46.244
Yes, ma'am.

31:08.465 --> 31:12.102
Hey, you do video, right?

31:14.071 --> 31:16.540
Yeah, so I have this dog,
but I want to blow it up.

31:16.573 --> 31:19.443
I want to make it like
a silhouette, so I saw you
using the green screen.

31:19.476 --> 31:23.081
And if I can use that
to blow it up and make
them silhouettes that move...

31:28.485 --> 31:32.456
So you know your boy
had a private session
with Sage yesterday, right?

31:32.489 --> 31:35.993
-Yo, are you for real?
-Yeah, man, we was
choppin' it up about the tour.

31:36.026 --> 31:37.394
He was showin' me moves.
Man, you know how it is.

31:37.428 --> 31:39.597
Man, I wish I would've
been there, 'cause I
would've told Sage,

31:39.630 --> 31:41.966
&quot;You ain't gotta teach me
nothin', pimp.&quot;

31:41.999 --> 31:43.334
Peep this right here.
Turn me up.

31:47.438 --> 31:49.473
-[laughs]
-Yeah, Mr. Odom.

31:49.506 --> 31:51.175
-What you know
about that, shorty?
-Nah, nah, nah.

31:51.208 --> 31:55.113
See, you gotta
break it down like this.

31:55.612 --> 31:57.581
-Peace.
-Hey!

31:57.614 --> 31:59.684

-Professional.
-[laughs] Yeah.

34:18.589 --> 34:20.491
Hey, look, that was crazy.
This is the energy we need

34:20.524 --> 34:22.125
to bring to class
later today, okay?

34:22.159 --> 34:23.728
Mm-hm. Let's go.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.110
Hell, nah, I know
Dondre ain't in the trap.

34:40.143 --> 34:43.413
Let me guess, you either
chasing some project chick

34:43.447 --> 34:45.483
or your phone navigation
all fucked up.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.650
Nah, none of that.

34:47.684 --> 34:49.587
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Of course, man.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.288
Hey, you still having
that party tonight?

34:51.321 --> 34:52.822
Of course.
You gonna fall through, right?

34:52.856 --> 34:55.592
Man, you already know.
And for the eleven-teenth time,

34:55.626 --> 34:57.862
you need to let me sell my
inventory at your jam, homie.

34:57.895 --> 35:01.232
-Ah.
-Trying to tell you, man,
we could make a killing.

35:01.265 --> 35:05.469
You keep shooting me down,
but drug money is still money.

35:05.502 --> 35:07.671
And if it's good for me,
it's real good for you.

35:07.704 --> 35:09.640
You won't even know I'm
at the damn party, dawg.

35:09.673 --> 35:12.308
You'll just see me
in the back and get
a nice cut on the back end.

35:12.342 --> 35:13.678
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

35:14.878 --> 35:16.447
All right,
hypothetically speaking,

35:16.480 --> 35:18.182
let's just say I was open
to the idea for a minute.

35:18.215 --> 35:21.719
-Hmm.
-What would you do for me?

35:21.752 --> 35:23.587
I just told you I'll give you
a cut on the back side.

35:23.620 --> 35:26.457
Nah, you can keep the cut.
I want something else.

35:26.490 --> 35:28.859
-I'm listening.
-I need you to let the beef

35:28.892 --> 35:31.462
with ol' Ohio boy
and his sister slide.

35:31.495 --> 35:32.796
I'll take care
of the damages.

35:32.829 --> 35:35.533
-Just let them be, all right?
-[laughs]

35:35.566 --> 35:38.169
Damn, I mean,
I know shorty fine
and all that,

35:38.202 --> 35:39.870
but is the ass really
that good, homie?

35:39.903 --> 35:41.705
-Nah, it ain't about that.
-What you mean it
ain't about that?

35:41.738 --> 35:44.174
-It ain't about her?
-Nah.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.911
Who's it about?
Is it about him?

35:46.944 --> 35:48.579
-Nigga, you gay?
-Chill out.

35:48.612 --> 35:50.214
Hey, let me know, homie.

35:50.247 --> 35:51.781
I ain't giving my
Chick-fil-A up for nobody.

35:51.815 --> 35:53.450
Whatever, man.
We got a deal or what?

35:53.483 --> 35:55.786
[groans] All right,
let's run it.

35:55.819 --> 35:58.589
We got that.
We got a deal, homie.

35:59.723 --> 36:01.458
All right, man.
Keep it easy, Dondre.

36:01.491 --> 36:02.960
Aight.
All righty.

36:02.993 --> 36:04.662
Easy money.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.665
[R&amp;B playing]

37:02.819 --> 37:06.357
[cheering, applause]

37:11.361 --> 37:14.565
That, my friends, is what
we mean by collaboration.

37:14.598 --> 37:19.603
That piece was about teamwork,
connection, and trust.

37:19.636 --> 37:22.873
As well as some
other intangibles.
[laughs]

37:22.906 --> 37:24.642
Okay, who's left?

37:27.344 --> 37:28.512
You haven't gone yet.

37:29.713 --> 37:31.815
-Where's your group?
-Uh...

37:31.848 --> 37:33.917
[snickering]

37:33.950 --> 37:35.620
I just need a minute.

37:39.556 --> 37:40.791
What's that?

37:45.629 --> 37:48.531
[indistinct chatter]

38:01.945 --> 38:04.882
[downtempo hip-hop playing]

38:37.080 --> 38:39.717
[energy kicks up]

39:10.680 --> 39:12.482
[cheers, applause]

39:13.884 --> 39:17.454
Bravo!

39:17.487 --> 39:18.889
Bra-muthafuckin'-vo!

39:18.922 --> 39:21.458
Did y'all see that?
Did y'all see this?

39:21.491 --> 39:23.861
This is what I'm talking about!
This-- This is what I need.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.096
-This is why I'm here!
-He didn't even follow
the assignment.

39:26.129 --> 39:28.399
Shut up.
He did do the assignment.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.401
He was supposed to partner.
He partnered with himself.

39:30.434 --> 39:32.436
Thinkin' outside the box.
He just raised the bar

39:32.469 --> 39:33.837
on all you muthafuckas,
and you know what?

39:33.870 --> 39:35.806
I love it!
You wanna rock with me?

39:35.839 --> 39:38.609
-Stuff like this. Yes?
-[students] Yes.

39:38.642 --> 39:40.410
-Yes?
-[louder] Yes!

39:41.578 --> 39:43.180
-Great job. Great job.
-Thanks, man.

39:43.213 --> 39:44.982
Shit like that!

39:45.015 --> 39:46.717
[McCoy] Thank you very much,
everybody.

39:46.750 --> 39:47.951
Class dismissed.

39:47.984 --> 39:49.819
[indistinct chatter]

39:49.853 --> 39:51.522
-Great, man.
-Thank you.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.955
Good job.

39:52.989 --> 39:54.892
-Yo.
-Man!

39:54.925 --> 39:57.561
I couldn't have done it without
you, man, seriously, thank you.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.432
[Poppy] All right, I see you.

40:02.933 --> 40:04.101
That was tight.

40:04.134 --> 40:07.805
[chuckles] Uh... thanks.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.873
But you know you gotta do
that every day here, right?

40:09.906 --> 40:12.142
Yeah, right, I'm starting
to figure that out.

40:12.175 --> 40:13.844
All right.

40:13.877 --> 40:18.148
And, yeah, hey, but...
for what it's worth,

40:18.181 --> 40:21.552
Rigo shouldn't have stepped
in for you at the battle.

40:21.585 --> 40:22.720
That's wrong.

40:23.220 --> 40:24.754
I know.

40:33.763 --> 40:35.232
Sorry, sir, I can't let you
in the building right now.

40:35.265 --> 40:37.234
What?
You know who I am?

40:37.267 --> 40:39.102
Of course I do.
You're Rigo's father,

40:39.135 --> 40:40.604
but it's Sage's new policy.

40:40.637 --> 40:42.206
No parents allowed
during school hours.

40:42.239 --> 40:45.809
Sage's policy?
What kind of bullshit
is that?

40:45.842 --> 40:49.112
I'm sorry, but, uh,
either you can wait out here

40:49.145 --> 40:51.515
or I can have you escorted
off the property.

40:53.517 --> 40:56.486
Boy, you ever put
your hands on me, I--

41:01.591 --> 41:04.194
All right.
Forget this shit.

41:04.227 --> 41:06.830
You be sure and tell
your little boss...

41:06.863 --> 41:08.698
he can't keep me
out of everywhere.

41:11.601 --> 41:12.603
Fuck!

41:15.772 --> 41:17.107
Hey, I'll holla at you.

41:17.140 --> 41:19.109
Aight, dawg.
Be good.

41:19.142 --> 41:21.611
Hey.

41:21.645 --> 41:24.882
Hey, congratulations
on our little battle earlier.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.617
You dope as hell.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.151
But I'm pretty sure you already
know that, though, right?

41:28.184 --> 41:31.088
Not really, but that's
nice of you to say.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.790
Hey, hold on, wait.

41:33.823 --> 41:36.692
Check it. All right, Sage
been working with me one-on-one

41:36.726 --> 41:39.696
to get right for the tour,
and the moves is mad fire.

41:39.729 --> 41:41.198
so if you're interested,

41:41.231 --> 41:42.733
I wouldn't mind
showing 'em to you.

41:42.766 --> 41:44.935
-Sage.
-Yeah.

41:46.803 --> 41:48.538
Okay. Sure, I guess.

41:48.572 --> 41:50.240
[Sage] Rigo. Rigo?

41:50.273 --> 41:51.875
Let me talk
to you right quick.

41:51.908 --> 41:53.544
See? Told you.

41:54.945 --> 41:56.647
-How you feel?
-Good.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.281
You know why I was working
you so hard yesterday, right?

41:58.315 --> 41:59.883
Nah, man, it's cool.
I can handle it.

41:59.916 --> 42:01.818
I know that,
'cause you're a star.

42:01.851 --> 42:02.920
[chuckles]

42:02.953 --> 42:04.555
I don't see it
in a lot of people,

42:04.588 --> 42:06.323
but I see it in you.
You got that potential to...

42:06.356 --> 42:07.991
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

42:08.024 --> 42:10.127
But you gotta be willing
to do what it takes.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.596
-You know I am.
-I know. I know.

42:12.629 --> 42:15.632
Listen, nobody's been there
but me, so I'm the only person

42:15.665 --> 42:18.769
-that can really guide you,
you dig?
-Ain't nobody gonna outwork me.

42:18.802 --> 42:21.638
I know that, but see,
the work is the easy part.

42:21.671 --> 42:22.806
You know what
the hard part is?

42:24.774 --> 42:26.643
Hard part is coming
to wraps with the fact

42:26.676 --> 42:29.779
that everybody can't take
the ride with you.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.748
Let me explain
something to you. See...

42:31.781 --> 42:35.185
when you're a star, there's
gonna be a lot of people
want to tag along,

42:35.218 --> 42:37.620
ride your coattails,
take credit for shit,

42:37.654 --> 42:39.623
get in your way,
slow you down.

42:39.656 --> 42:41.158
You know,
folks like your pops.

42:42.092 --> 42:43.894
But you trust me,
though, right?

42:45.629 --> 42:47.029
Yeah. Yeah.

42:47.063 --> 42:48.265
I ain't gonna
steer you wrong, brother.

42:48.298 --> 42:49.933
-It's me and you, yeah?
-Yeah.

42:49.966 --> 42:51.268
-Always, bro.
-All right.

42:51.301 --> 42:52.703
All right, man,
I'll holla at you.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.104
All right.

43:02.212 --> 43:03.747
Hey.

43:03.780 --> 43:05.249
What up?

43:08.018 --> 43:10.020
Sage taking care of you
like I asked?

43:10.053 --> 43:13.256
-Yeah.
-He say anything about
those beats I gave him?

43:13.289 --> 43:15.759
Yeah, he said he was
gonna get right on it.

43:17.727 --> 43:19.261
All right.

43:19.295 --> 43:22.299
[engine starts]

43:22.332 --> 43:24.634
[Davis] Today was such a blast.

43:26.002 --> 43:27.237
Thank you.

43:27.270 --> 43:28.905
Hey, don't
thank me now.

43:28.938 --> 43:30.874
Just buy me dinner every
night when you make it.

43:30.907 --> 43:33.944
-[both laughing]
-Okay, okay, deal.

43:33.977 --> 43:36.846
When I get as good as you,
I'll be happy to.

43:39.382 --> 43:43.354
Hey, if you wanna, you can
crash on the couch here tonight.

43:46.690 --> 43:48.225
Just friends.

43:48.258 --> 43:49.759
Pinky shit.

43:52.162 --> 43:54.297
[sighs]

43:54.330 --> 43:56.366
Nah, nah, I better not.

43:58.268 --> 44:00.103
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

44:00.136 --> 44:01.805
See you tomorrow.

44:07.377 --> 44:08.979
Thanks.

44:22.926 --> 44:24.962
Wow. [exhales]

44:37.474 --> 44:39.042
[sighs]

44:39.075 --> 44:40.377
[ratchet clicking]

44:40.410 --> 44:44.281
What--
what the hell's this?

44:44.314 --> 44:47.116
[chuckling] It's a--
It's a ballet pole.

44:47.150 --> 44:50.921
You'd be better
at this than fightin'.
You know.

44:50.954 --> 44:54.258
Not the kind of pole
that I was gonna put
in here, but, you know.

44:55.191 --> 44:57.961
Hey, congratulations, kid.

44:57.994 --> 45:00.263
Keep up the good work.

45:00.296 --> 45:02.866
[down-tempo music playing]

45:04.501 --> 45:06.170
[chuckles]

45:26.523 --> 45:28.325
[Al] You must be
out of your damn mind
if you think

45:28.358 --> 45:30.093
I'm gonna let you
go out of this house
at this hour!

45:30.126 --> 45:31.895
[Janelle] Come on,
I worked for you all day.

45:31.928 --> 45:33.230
The rest of my day was shit.

45:33.263 --> 45:35.332
-I just need some air!
-You better listen to me.

45:35.365 --> 45:38.435
'Cause you're gonna
do something
you're going to regret!

45:40.336 --> 45:42.071
-Hey, Dondre.
-What's up, girl?

45:56.352 --> 45:57.921
I'm sorry I missed dinner.

45:57.954 --> 46:00.056
Um, I'm just leaving
the campus library now.

46:00.089 --> 46:01.958
My meeting
with the professor
ran late.

46:01.991 --> 46:03.493
So I'll be home soon.

46:03.526 --> 46:04.928
[woman] All right.
I'll see you then.

46:04.961 --> 46:07.163
-Okay, bye.
-Bye, sweetheart.

46:33.590 --> 46:36.360
[hip-hop blasting
on sound system]

46:42.265 --> 46:43.900
[man] Hey, Dondre!

46:43.933 --> 46:45.969
Yo, Dondre!

46:47.170 --> 46:48.872
[Janelle chuckles]

46:48.905 --> 46:49.973
What's good, baby?

46:50.006 --> 46:51.841
[chattering]

47:03.419 --> 47:06.857
Relax.
Everything's cool.

47:06.890 --> 47:08.325
Watch.

47:15.164 --> 47:16.499
[man 2]
Yo, sick party, Dondre!

47:16.532 --> 47:19.002
What did you do?

47:19.035 --> 47:21.004
We came to
an understanding.

47:21.037 --> 47:23.506
Tell your brother we're
all good now, okay?

47:23.539 --> 47:26.410
But no more bricks
through the window, all right?

47:31.481 --> 47:33.383
Thank you.

47:34.517 --> 47:36.019
Any time.

47:36.052 --> 47:39.222
[new song playing]

47:39.255 --> 47:41.958
[all chanting]
Turn up! Turn up! Turn up!

47:41.991 --> 47:44.061
Turn up! Turn up!

47:52.068 --> 47:53.971
You know what
this is, right?

47:55.972 --> 47:58.074
What, did you want one?

47:58.107 --> 47:59.343
Uh, yeah.

48:08.618 --> 48:10.187
Yeah.

48:20.697 --> 48:23.433
[phone buzzing]

48:36.546 --> 48:37.681
[door slams]

48:37.714 --> 48:40.284

One, two, ready, hey!

49:33.536 --> 49:35.438
Next
on Step Up High Water...

49:35.471 --> 49:38.141
I have a show coming up
and I need a dancer.

49:38.174 --> 49:41.011
What if you let me help you
throw your party
tomorrow night?

49:41.044 --> 49:42.379
I'm about to proposition you.

49:42.412 --> 49:43.747
You know you're not
my type.

49:43.780 --> 49:45.782
Are you seriously here
with Rigo right now?

49:45.815 --> 49:47.617
I am doing what I need to do
to make it.

49:47.650 --> 49:50.454
Either you in
or you ain't.
