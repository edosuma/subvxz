01:09.819 --> 01:12.655
James Gordon, I have a warrant
for your arrest.

01:12.738 --> 01:14.782
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

01:14.865 --> 01:17.577
The rally's tomorrow night.
Everything's in place.

01:18.202 --> 01:19.328
You know what to do.

01:19.412 --> 01:23.082
I'm going to see Jim Gordon gets
all the public support we can muster.

01:23.165 --> 01:26.085
All the top cops will be there,
so don't worry your pretty little head.

01:26.335 --> 01:27.712
Should be quite a show.

01:27.795 --> 01:31.757
Yes, and I know someone who'd be
a real Showstopper.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.719
The best thing you can do for him
is to keep out of it.

01:35.928 --> 01:40.182
Sorry, Batman. You being at the rally
could decide if Dad goes free.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.352
<i>So you'll be there, one way or another.</i>

01:43.644 --> 01:47.231
After all Commissioner Gordon
has done for Gotham City,

01:47.315 --> 01:50.901
<i>the least the city can do for him
is grant him bail.</i>

01:54.322 --> 01:56.032
Gil, you know those guys
who shot at you?

01:56.115 --> 01:57.533
Well, I think I know who one of them...

01:58.200 --> 02:00.870
I didn't know you had company.

02:00.953 --> 02:02.747
My friend here was just leaving.

02:03.289 --> 02:07.335
Yeah, gotta run. Listen, I'll see you
at the business meeting, Gil.

02:08.961 --> 02:09.962
Look at that.

02:11.964 --> 02:14.759
<i>Mr. Mason ducked before he saw the guns.</i>

02:14.842 --> 02:16.719
Almost as though he expected it.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.388
What am I gonna do?

02:19.472 --> 02:22.516
If Gil's involved in this,
there's nobody I can trust.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.419
- Where will you start?
- With Gil Mason.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.713
The videotape clearly shows
that he ducked

02:52.797 --> 02:54.590
before those shots were fired.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.594
If he knew he was gonna be shot at,

02:58.678 --> 03:01.305
he probably knows a lot more
about what's going on.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.057
Then he may know more
than he's letting on

03:03.140 --> 03:06.060
about Commissioner Gordon's
unfortunate situation.

03:06.143 --> 03:07.353
I hope so, Alfred.

03:07.728 --> 03:10.731
'Cause if this lead fizzles,
I'm fresh out of ideas.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.329
Stop!

04:09.957 --> 04:11.333
You again?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.961
Listen, under other circumstances,
this could be fun,

04:14.044 --> 04:15.588
but I've got a job to do.

04:15.963 --> 04:17.506
Don't flatter yourself.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.885
Well, I don't have time
to babysit amateurs, okay?

04:21.177 --> 04:23.596
I may not have a diploma
from crime-fighting school,

04:23.679 --> 04:25.598
but I can do fine on my own, thanks.

04:26.015 --> 04:30.102
- What are you doing here anyway?
- Same as you. We both suspect Mason of-

04:42.823 --> 04:44.241
Mason here.

04:45.117 --> 04:47.495
You wanna meet? Okay, where?

04:47.787 --> 04:49.288
What's he saying?

04:49.997 --> 04:51.040
Dork.

04:55.002 --> 04:57.838
South Gotham subway,
the old river entrance. In one hour.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.176
Right. I'm on my way.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.141
Well, show's over.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.352
You can run along home now.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.400
- Okay.
- Okay?

05:18.484 --> 05:21.237
If you won't let me help you,
what else can I do?

05:21.570 --> 05:23.906
Good. You've got some sense after all.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.912
Nice guy,
but a few bats short of a belfry.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.386
Whoa!

05:48.848 --> 05:50.474
Gotta work on that landing, girl.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.685
I guess the party started without me.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.827
You sure you haven't seen him
at the department?

06:52.870 --> 06:54.079
I'd remember that face.

06:54.538 --> 06:55.831
Who is he?

06:56.206 --> 06:58.584
In a few minutes,
nobody's gonna care.

07:03.505 --> 07:05.799
- Okay, you're done.
- So that's it?

07:05.883 --> 07:09.720
You bring me all the way to South Gotham
to ID some two-bit hood?

07:09.803 --> 07:11.764
Don't get wise with me, Mason.

07:11.847 --> 07:14.600
Remember who got you set up
as Gordon's assistant.

07:14.683 --> 07:16.435
Right, Harvey, right.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.774
Don't call me that!
It's Two-Face to you, pretty boy.

07:22.107 --> 07:25.945
Okay, okay. Two-Face, take it easy.
You're the man.

07:26.278 --> 07:29.365
Don't you forget it.
Since our little stunt at the rally,

07:29.448 --> 07:32.284
I got this city thinking
you're the best thing since the Batman.

07:33.827 --> 07:35.829
Once Gordon's out of the picture...

07:37.665 --> 07:39.833
You'll be a shoo-in to take his place.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.921
In fact, they could be calling you
Commissioner by tomorrow.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.381
Tomorrow?

07:45.464 --> 07:47.007
I'm stepping up the timetable.

07:47.091 --> 07:52.179
Too many people nosing around.
This guy, that Batgirl chippy.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.431
I'm not taking any chances.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.892
My men will bust Gordon
out of jail tonight.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.228
Then we'll dump him off Bayshore Wharf.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.439
- Hey!
- What's that?

08:02.523 --> 08:04.066
Hey, did you hear something?

08:05.859 --> 08:07.987
We got company. Over there.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.784
Robin, look out!

08:15.244 --> 08:16.328
Robin?

08:27.381 --> 08:31.301
If he's Robin, that makes you...

08:47.693 --> 08:48.777
Let's go!

08:58.162 --> 08:59.288
Blow it!

09:18.265 --> 09:19.975
Just whose side are you on?

09:20.059 --> 09:23.145
You're right. If I hadn't let him
take me by surprise-

09:23.228 --> 09:26.356
Robin! I see you brought a date.

09:26.940 --> 09:29.359
Me? I thought she was with you.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.279
She's got your taste in clothes,
speaking of which...

09:33.322 --> 09:36.200
Yes. Am I glad to see you.

09:36.283 --> 09:37.951
Do you mind?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.037
Sorry.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.458
Well, this is just great. Now Batman
and Robin know what's going on.

09:44.708 --> 09:46.752
The bat-chick too. I saw her.

09:47.044 --> 09:50.547
The explosion probably
took care of them. But just in case...

10:05.020 --> 10:07.481
I don't know who you are
or why you're doing this,

10:07.564 --> 10:09.191
but let's get one thing straight.

10:09.608 --> 10:12.444
It takes more than a costume
and an attitude to do this work.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.655
Look, I've got a reason
for being here so-

10:14.738 --> 10:16.198
You've already fouled up once.

10:16.740 --> 10:19.368
Stay out of our way
so it doesn't happen again.

10:27.668 --> 10:31.755
I should've known it would be Two-Face.
It's a perfect two-part plan.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.925
He consolidates the gangs
while Mason takes over the police.

10:35.008 --> 10:37.469
What he said about the Commissioner,
will he-

10:37.553 --> 10:39.096
You saw him flip his coin.

10:39.596 --> 10:42.516
It's judge, jury, and executioner.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.524
And here we sit with no way to...

10:50.607 --> 10:51.692
Huh?

10:51.775 --> 10:53.026
Sounds like a train.

11:03.453 --> 11:04.538
Argh!

11:07.457 --> 11:08.542
Hold on.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.803
Not bad. Maybe there's hope
for you after all.

11:40.699 --> 11:41.909
Hurry, Batman!

11:50.709 --> 11:53.086
Great. Only how do we get to it?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.881
Always carry a spare.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.889
You first. Press here to send
it back down to us.

12:03.972 --> 12:04.973
Wait.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.645
Just in case
you run into trouble up there.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.896
Thanks.

12:46.181 --> 12:48.058
If I ever get reinstated, Bullock,

12:48.141 --> 12:50.227
remind me to do something
about the food in here.

12:50.602 --> 12:54.690
Relax, Commish. We got the judge
to reconsider bail, didn't we?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.236
You gonna eat that pickle?

13:22.926 --> 13:24.803
- What in...
- Come on, Commissioner.

13:24.886 --> 13:27.639
Rupert Thorne doesn't
desert his friends.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.683
Thorne...

13:36.148 --> 13:40.110
Get some keys down here!
Never a blasted cop when you need one.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.517
Think she made it?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.229
I hope so.

14:16.980 --> 14:18.231
Think we'll make it?

14:20.442 --> 14:23.445
What do you think about the
commissioner's innocence now, Detective?

14:23.904 --> 14:26.615
- I don't know.
- Come on, he has to be guilty.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.451
- Have you heard from Gordon?
- Any leads about his whereabouts?

14:29.534 --> 14:30.911
You think he's left town?

14:32.662 --> 14:37.417
- Get out of my face, all of you.
- Detective. Detective.

14:38.543 --> 14:39.836
I can barely hear you, miss!

14:39.920 --> 14:42.964
The phone lines
must've been damaged by the explosion.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.550
Speak up!

14:46.134 --> 14:49.012
I said Commissioner Gordon's in danger.

14:49.304 --> 14:50.847
I still can't hear you.

14:50.931 --> 14:54.142
If you want the story
on Gordon's breakout, come down here.

14:55.310 --> 14:56.395
Breakout?

14:57.145 --> 14:58.438
They've got him.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.410
I've got an idea.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.246
It's about time.

15:41.940 --> 15:45.110
- Where are we going?
- We'II find out when we get there.

16:43.084 --> 16:45.337
Subways are getting
more dangerous every day.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.380
You think they got
the Commissioner by now?

16:47.589 --> 16:50.634
Most likely. We've got to
get to Bayshore Wharf.

16:51.051 --> 16:54.971
Glad it's not far. I hate wet shoes.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.103
It's business, Jim. Nothing personal.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.856
Matter of fact, I respect you. I do.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.776
But a fella has to take
his opportunities where he finds them.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.279
And with you out of the way,
I'll be mayor inside of a year.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.365
You're sick, Gil. A lot sicker than him.

17:13.740 --> 17:15.700
At least I can see his bad half.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.953
Sorry you feel that way.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.205
At least you won't have to worry
about Barbara.

17:20.288 --> 17:21.706
I'll take good care of her.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.000
She's very fond of me, you know.

17:24.084 --> 17:28.547
You piece of scum. I may not be around
to stop you but I know someone who will.

17:29.005 --> 17:30.507
I wouldn't count on it, Jim.

17:30.590 --> 17:33.260
There's been a recent decline
in the bat population.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.769
Run, Commissioner!

17:48.817 --> 17:49.818
Get him!

17:52.654 --> 17:54.239
Batgirl, I presume.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.369
Don't worry. I'll get you out of this.

17:59.452 --> 18:00.495
Somehow.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.922
Miss me?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.427
I think you're safe now, sir.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.266
Get him. Snuff the Bat!

18:36.114 --> 18:37.157
What?

18:43.246 --> 18:46.207
You've screwed up my plans
for the last time, Batman.

19:09.397 --> 19:11.232
No, you don't.

19:42.597 --> 19:43.598
Ahhh!

19:56.361 --> 20:00.907
- That's a first. A coin flips Two-Face.
- Where's Batgirl?

20:00.990 --> 20:03.243
Out there. On her own.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.427
Now let's see who you really are.

20:21.928 --> 20:26.182
- Barbara? I didn't know it was you.
- Would it have made a difference, Gil?

20:37.110 --> 20:39.487
I ought to leave you here.

21:03.303 --> 21:06.765
Commissioner, I understand
that Gil Mason is still in a coma.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.100
Yes, but even so, he has been indicted.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.145
So how does it feel to be
behind your desk again?

21:12.228 --> 21:15.064
A heck of a lot better than it felt
being behind bars.

21:15.523 --> 21:17.609
And what of the mysterious Batgirl?

21:17.692 --> 21:20.862
Who is she and where has she
vanished to? Any thoughts?

21:21.154 --> 21:22.655
As far as I'm concerned,

21:22.739 --> 21:24.991
she's as welcome
in Gotham City as the Batman.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.494
How do you think Batman
will feel about that?

21:27.994 --> 21:30.121
I suppose there's always room
for one more.

21:30.205 --> 21:33.583
And I have a feeling
we'll be seeing her again.

21:33.666 --> 21:35.835
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

22:18.753 --> 22:19.754
