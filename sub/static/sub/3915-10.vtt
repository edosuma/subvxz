NARRATOR:
Previously on Beauty and the Beast:

00:03.880 --> 00:05.530
- Liam sent you.
- Who is Liam?

00:05.680 --> 00:08.206
JULIANNA: He tricked me into
making him superhuman.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.489
And I have been trying to figure out
how to stop him, and now you have to.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.003
Quickly, go. Move it.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.650
[ALARM RINGING]

00:23.760 --> 00:26.684
- Where'd he go?
- He's gone.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.366
- Liam's going after more victims.
- What are you talking about?

00:29.520 --> 00:30.726
There aren't any more victims.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.121
Yeah, well, try telling that
to Liam's hit man. Get this.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.362
I just tracked him to Alton Finn.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.922
Alton? But the serum
isn't even in him anymore.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.162
I know, which means that Liam's
now going after anyone

00:41.320 --> 00:42.731
who's had the serum in them.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.883
Hey, hey, sorry I'm late.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.407
I had to go check in on Alton,
make sure he's okay.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.404
- Of course. How is he?
- Scared. You know, another minute,

01:15.560 --> 01:17.483
and Liam's hired gun
would've drained enough blood

01:17.640 --> 01:21.201
- to put him into hypovolemic shock.
- It's a good thing you got to him in time.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.045
And a good thing
that you did not listen to me.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.727
Ugh. Would you stop beating
yourself up about that, okay?

01:27.880 --> 01:31.327
Wanting DHS back on the case,
it made all the sense in the world.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.768
Especially after what Liam did
to our wedding.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.241
Still, I was wrong.
lt is our responsibility to stop Liam,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.370
and forgetting that almost
cost Heather and J.T. their lives.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.045
Listen to me.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.648
We are a team, okay?

01:45.800 --> 01:47.370
And there is no easy answer here.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.649
Which is why sometimes you rely
on me, and sometimes I rely on you.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.690
But since I've been
a little bit behind on that front,

01:53.840 --> 01:56.241
this time you get
to rely on me, okay?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.289
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.087
Now, what's all of this stuff?

02:01.240 --> 02:03.925
DHS files, our files.
I'm trying to profile Liam.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.969
Figure out who he really is,
so we can find him.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.249
What's there to know? Julianna turned
him into some superhuman killer.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.084
Unfortunately, that's all he is.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.163
Yes, well, if we can figure out
why he's killing,

02:13.320 --> 02:15.322
what his endgame is,
it might help us to track him.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.131
Look, I'm gonna track him way
before he gets to his endgame, okay?

02:18.280 --> 02:19.850
As good as he is
at covering his tracks,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.446
killing anything and everything
that's enhanced.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.524
Which is why we're protecting
J.T. and Alton, I know, but...

02:25.680 --> 02:27.364
Okay, look at this.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.250
Three hospice bombings,
all since Liam came to the city.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.925
Okay, what's that got to do with him?

02:33.080 --> 02:36.129
Maybe nothing, but it matches
the same type of targeted attack

02:36.280 --> 02:39.966
in four of the countries that Liam
was in before he came to New York.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.248
I'm just saying, his MO is to hide,

02:42.400 --> 02:45.324
cover up his superhuman tracks
and enhanced blood, right?

02:45.480 --> 02:48.245
So maybe these bombings
are connected somehow.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.084
Maybe he's looking
for somebody else.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.244
Look, with all due respect,
we tried tracking him the police way,

02:53.400 --> 02:55.562
it didn't work out, all right?

02:55.720 --> 02:59.008
But I'm gonna go get changed, get
back out there, and track him my way.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.003
Vincent, I am telling you,
something tells me--

03:01.160 --> 03:04.209
Look, we know what he wants now,
okay? J.T. and Alton.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.840
It means he's probably out there
stalking them somehow,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.527
which means I can pick up
his trail, okay? Please.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.963
- Just trust me this time, okay?
- Okay.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.485
Okay.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.570
- Hey, J.T., you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.090
This is like bad dÃ©ja vu. Can't believe
I'm under police protection again.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.288
- Mind if I use your restroom?
- Yes.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.569
Look, just hang in there, okay?
We're gonna get Liam, buddy.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.121
<i>Great, when? Because I just
got an e-mail from my dean,</i>

03:38.280 --> 03:40.521
saying he needs
my tenure package tonight.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.808
Okay, look, I'm gonna go
track Liam right now.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.122
Please, tell me you had some
luck on those blood tests.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.281
No, nothing.

03:46.440 --> 03:50.809
There's no trace of the enhanced
serum in either my blood or Allen's,

03:50.960 --> 03:54.407
which means it doesn't make
any sense why Liam is still after us.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.086
Maybe he just doesn't know,
you know, and he wants to make sure.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.607
Or maybe he knows something
about the serum that I don't,

03:59.760 --> 04:01.888
<i>- and I'm just missing it.
- Wait.</i>

04:02.040 --> 04:04.361
- Why'd you say you got that e-mail?
- What do you mean?

04:04.520 --> 04:07.490
- Well, you're still on sabbatical, right?
- Yeah.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.688
- So why the sudden tenure rush?
- I don't know.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.047
- You think it's a trap?
- To lure you out in the open?

04:12.200 --> 04:15.204
Yeah, possibly. Buddy, this could be
the break that we're looking for.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.930
But why don't you give Alton a call,
see if he can help figure out

04:18.079 --> 04:19.649
why Liam's still after
your blood, okay?

04:19.800 --> 04:21.404
Okay, but what are you gonna do?

04:21.560 --> 04:24.643

any symptoms, by any chance?

05:05.480 --> 05:08.609
- What kind of symptoms?
- From the serum.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.922
But I thought you said
it all got transfused out of me

05:11.080 --> 05:14.880
- during my operation.
- It did, or at least I think it did.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.442
- Just like I thought it was all out of me.
- Wait, isn't it?

yeah, according to all my tests, but...</i>

No, no, none of that.

- Nosebleeds?
- Yeah, but <i>the</i> doctors <i>think</i>

it's a serum symptom, do you?

that he was after J.T.

Yeah, I'm just not sure what, exactly.

You know, you might be right
about those hospice bombings

in all the hospice bombings, right?

09:43.280 --> 09:44.566
You read my files?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.803
You said that investigating this
like a police case wouldn't help.

Right now I don't care about that.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.205
Well, if the bombings are connected,

11:38.720 --> 11:40.768
- Patient X.
- What?

11:40.920 --> 11:43.810
I skipped over it in Julianna's files
because there was no name attached.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.486
<i>I just assumed it was part
of a control group, but now I think</i>

11:46.640 --> 11:50.087
that Patient X was the first victim
that Julianna experimented on.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.969
- Okay, but why no name?
- <i>I don't</i> know.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.487
Maybe she was trying
to protect him for some reason.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.608
Well, that makes sense
if he's an experiment,

11:56.760 --> 11:59.525
<i>since they all ultimately die
if the serum's not removed.</i>

11:59.680 --> 12:01.409
It might explain
the hospice connection too.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.164
<i>Yeah, and why Liam's after him.</i>

I injected myself
to protect her from him.

Liam came to her,

kind of rare neurological disease.

experimenting on cell regeneration

16:02.040 --> 16:03.724

into experimenting on him.

was dealing with, or who he was.

just wanted to protect me from him.

with trying to find a way,

at this point is a big mistake.

would attack the precinct,

the same serum on him?

No, but it had some
of the same properties,

if he tracked J.T. or Russell.
