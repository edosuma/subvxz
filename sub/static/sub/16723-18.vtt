00:19.346 --> 00:20.813
Low tide is great.

00:20.848 --> 00:22.849
The ocean is just
giving this stuff away?

00:22.850 --> 00:25.618
If you see any bottles, check
for a romantic message inside.

00:25.619 --> 00:27.620
I call dibs on any hook hands
or peg legs.

00:27.621 --> 00:29.455
Hey, what do you think this is?

00:29.456 --> 00:30.523
(sniffs) It smells disgusting!

00:30.557 --> 00:32.992
(sniffs) No, wait, it smells amazing!

00:33.027 --> 00:36.396
(sniffs) Like the boys' locker
room on a hot summer day.

00:36.397 --> 00:37.730
ALL: (sniffing) Gross!

00:37.731 --> 00:38.998
(sniffing) Great!

00:38.999 --> 00:41.067
(sniffing) Gross! Great!

00:41.068 --> 00:45.071
I can't stop smelling this
enigma of gross-great.

00:45.072 --> 00:47.006
Is that what sex will be like?

00:47.041 --> 00:49.409
Hey, Mr. Fisch!

00:49.443 --> 00:51.511
Hey, m'lady Bob.

00:51.545 --> 00:53.146
(chuckles) Uh, rent's not due, is it?

00:53.147 --> 00:55.481
I mean more due than usual?

00:55.482 --> 00:57.950
Relax. I just stopped by
to introduce you to my brother.

00:57.951 --> 00:59.986
Brother? I didn't know
you had a brother.

00:59.987 --> 01:01.988
Yep, I have a brother. Felix.

01:01.989 --> 01:03.790
He's, uh, in town for a while.

01:03.791 --> 01:05.725
(quietly): His inheritance ran out.

01:05.726 --> 01:08.328
So he'll be doing some
of the landlording around here.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.029
Keep him out of my hair, will you?

01:10.064 --> 01:12.231
Um, o-okay.
Where is he?

01:12.266 --> 01:14.334
He's right, uh... Oh. Uh,

01:14.368 --> 01:16.235
oh, he might not want to come in.

01:16.270 --> 01:17.904
Felix, come here!
FELIX: No!

01:17.905 --> 01:20.073
Felix...
It looks gross!

01:20.074 --> 01:22.075
Please, Felix.
It's okay to come in.

01:22.076 --> 01:24.410
I came in, and look at me.
I'm fine!

01:24.411 --> 01:27.146
(door opens) There you go. Hi, pal.

01:27.147 --> 01:29.415
Hi! Greetings!
(quietly): I don't want to be here.

01:29.416 --> 01:31.751
Shush. For all your landlording needs,
(grunts)

01:31.752 --> 01:33.486
Felix is your man.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.356
Oh, uh, great. Well, did you get
my messages about the bathroom?

01:36.357 --> 01:39.058
That I left you?
For the last several months?

01:39.059 --> 01:40.293
Yes, I got them.

01:40.294 --> 01:41.627
How the hell did you get my number?

01:41.628 --> 01:43.663
You gave it to me when we met.

01:43.697 --> 01:44.697
Not to use!

01:44.698 --> 01:46.899
Well, uh, last week,
the sink exploded.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.534
And the hot water is brown.

01:48.535 --> 01:50.937
Hot brown water?
Felix loves hot brown water.

01:50.938 --> 01:52.905
I do?
He's good at all that stuff

01:52.906 --> 01:54.774
that you just were yammering on about.

01:54.775 --> 01:56.209
Well, gotta go.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.877
Okay, so do you want to call a...

01:57.878 --> 01:59.879
Yes, I'll call
whatever you were about to say.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.348
Plumber.
Plumber. Of course, yes. Why?

02:02.383 --> 02:04.784
You know, I can just call him.
I'm supposed to call him!

02:04.785 --> 02:06.486
Okay.
Oh, my God.

02:06.487 --> 02:08.321
Is it always like this?
Does it always take this long?

02:08.322 --> 02:09.989
Is there always this much talking?
What?

02:09.990 --> 02:11.758
Don't say anything else!
I'm not getting roped

02:11.759 --> 02:13.259
into another hour-long discussion!

02:13.260 --> 02:15.052
I'll call your plumber!
Good-bye!

02:15.062 --> 02:16.929
(huffing)

02:16.930 --> 02:18.164
Rich people run funny.

02:18.165 --> 02:20.099
Must be all the money
in their pockets.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.835
Or it's their big, rich,
golden wieners.

02:22.836 --> 02:24.904
Eh, it's probably their wieners.
Yep.

02:24.905 --> 02:27.273
Guys, you know that lump
we found on the beach?

02:27.274 --> 02:29.676
My name's Gene!
No, the smelly lump.

02:29.677 --> 02:31.144
His name's Gene!

02:31.178 --> 02:33.646
The other lump.
It's called... ambergris.

02:33.681 --> 02:36.215
Ambergris, aka beach garbage.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.117
And it comes from sperm whales:
"When a whale

02:38.118 --> 02:39.986
<i>"eats a squid, the sharp squid beak</i>

02:39.987 --> 02:42.255
<i>may irritate
the whale's digestive system."</i>

02:42.256 --> 02:44.657
Hey, whale, maybe stop
eating sharp squid beak!

02:44.658 --> 02:47.493
What are you trying to do?!
"When that happens,

02:47.528 --> 02:49.128
<i>"the whale's stomach
coats the squid beak</i>

02:49.129 --> 02:51.331
<i>"in a waxy substance
that the whale then passes."</i>

02:51.332 --> 02:52.632
GENE: <i>Passes to who?</i>

02:52.666 --> 02:55.335
Like in sports?
Boring whale sports.

02:55.336 --> 02:58.471
I think "passes" means "poops out."
Go on.

02:58.505 --> 03:01.975
"Fun fact: Ambergris is used in the
production of high-end perfumes."

03:01.976 --> 03:04.944
People pay to wear whale poop?
Wake up, Louise!

03:04.945 --> 03:07.947
People wear all sorts of animal
poops we don't even know about!

03:07.948 --> 03:10.049
It's not poop at all.
It's a waxy substance

03:10.050 --> 03:12.619
that whales secrete from...
Whoa! You can eat it!

03:12.620 --> 03:16.322
"King Charles II's favorite
meal was ambergris and eggs."

03:16.357 --> 03:18.658
Yep, he looks like a
breakfast-for-dinner kinda guy.

03:18.659 --> 03:21.327
That piece sold for $30,000?

03:21.362 --> 03:23.296
Our piece is bigger than that piece.

03:23.297 --> 03:25.131
Ah! Jackpot!

03:25.132 --> 03:26.866
Wait, whoa, whoa, where is our piece?

03:26.867 --> 03:29.535
Where is it?
Gene put it in Mom and Dad's bed.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.238
(panting) Hey,
why are you going into our bedroom?

03:32.239 --> 03:34.240
Probably putting something
gross in our bed.

03:34.241 --> 03:36.643
I'm taking something gross
<i>out</i> of your bed!

03:36.644 --> 03:39.012
Oh, good.
Thanks, sweetie!

03:39.046 --> 03:42.248
Okay. Here it is.
I'm holding $30,000 in my hands.

03:42.249 --> 03:44.417
If somebody wants this
and has that much money,

03:44.418 --> 03:46.653
they will give it to us?
Am I saying that right?

03:46.654 --> 03:48.288
That can't possibly be right.

03:48.322 --> 03:50.490
Slice me off a little nugget
of that, will ya?

03:50.491 --> 03:53.066
I just want to rest it on my tongue.
No way, Gene.

03:53.093 --> 03:54.827
Hey, but with your share
of the money, you can buy

03:54.828 --> 03:56.496
some other ambergris and eat that.

03:56.530 --> 03:58.865
Yes! It's like instant
gratification but later!

03:58.866 --> 04:01.067
Uhhhh...
What, Tina?

04:01.068 --> 04:03.870
We can't sell it.
What are you talking about?

04:03.904 --> 04:05.838
It says here:
Ambergris is illegal to sell

04:05.839 --> 04:07.707
because whales are endangered.
Oh, well.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.742
I'll just, um, look up the number

04:09.743 --> 04:12.178
for the whale crimes unit.
Tina? No.

04:12.179 --> 04:14.847
You're right. We can just ask
Mom and Dad what to do with it.

04:14.848 --> 04:17.083
They're pretty cool.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Tina,

04:17.084 --> 04:20.920
you're not telling Mom or Dad
or anybody, do you hear me?

04:20.921 --> 04:23.756
We found it, we're the ones
who are gonna get rich, okay?

04:23.757 --> 04:26.125
But it's illegal.
Tina, sweetie...

04:26.126 --> 04:27.794
Yeah?
Guess what? I got a secret.

04:27.795 --> 04:29.729
Hmm? Okay. Okay, ready?
You want to hear the secret?

04:29.730 --> 04:31.731
Yeah, what is it? Ah!
We're selling it!

04:31.732 --> 04:33.299
(quietly): Tina, tell me the secret.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.108
(grunts) Juicy.

04:36.718 --> 04:38.218
Good morning, parents!

04:38.253 --> 04:40.654
And good morning to you,
partners in victimless crime.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.089
Uhhhh...

04:42.123 --> 04:43.824
What do you think the odds are
that Felix will send

04:43.825 --> 04:45.592
a plumber today?
Twenty-twenty!

04:45.593 --> 04:46.994
Wait, is that an odd?

04:47.028 --> 04:49.096
Speaking of odd, uh,
yesterday, on the beach,

04:49.097 --> 04:52.433
Gene, Louise and I found a...
Sister! A word?

04:52.434 --> 04:53.734
What the hell was that?

04:53.735 --> 04:55.703
You're gonna blow our whole operation.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.938
I'm sorry, Louise; I just wanted
to get Mom and Dad's advice

04:57.939 --> 05:00.140
about whether we should
tell Mom and Dad.

05:00.141 --> 05:02.443
(groans) I mean,
whales are endangered, so...

05:02.444 --> 05:04.545
Just-just find a whale
to give your money to

05:04.546 --> 05:05.913
when this is all over, okay?

05:05.914 --> 05:07.815
Start a whale scholarship
or something!

05:07.816 --> 05:09.517
(muffled): Greetings, sisters.

05:09.551 --> 05:11.885
Gene, what are you nibbling on?
Is that a piece of the lump?

05:11.886 --> 05:13.687
Um, I'm protecting it.
Give it to me.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.622
Mm-mm...
Give it to me...

05:14.623 --> 05:16.090
Mm-mm.
You spit it out.

05:16.091 --> 05:18.792
Mm-mm. Mm. You spit it out.
Open up that craw!

05:18.793 --> 05:20.694
Mm-mm. Uh-uh.
And spit it out!

05:20.695 --> 05:22.363
Listen up, blubber lover,
Uh-huh.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.531
you use your share
to buy more ambergris...

05:24.532 --> 05:26.100
that's the plan, remember?

05:26.101 --> 05:28.102
(mumbles) Oh, all right!

05:28.103 --> 05:29.536
God, you're like a goat.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.105
I am like a goat!

05:31.106 --> 05:33.307
Listen, I thought of a connection
who can help us move this stuff.

05:33.308 --> 05:34.775
Who?

05:34.776 --> 05:38.579
The hardest, most ruthless
criminal we know.

05:38.613 --> 05:40.414
Hi, Mickey!
Hey, Mickey.

05:40.415 --> 05:42.316
Kids, what a nice surprise!
Nice gig.

05:42.317 --> 05:43.817
Yep. The "Queezy Queen."

05:43.818 --> 05:45.152
It's good honest work.

05:45.153 --> 05:46.820
Pull the lever, push the lever,

05:46.821 --> 05:49.223
"you have to be this tall,"
and that is it.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.425
Uh-huh.
Yep! Just push and pull.

05:51.426 --> 05:52.493
Very Zahn.

05:52.494 --> 05:53.527
You mean "Zen"?

05:53.528 --> 05:54.962
Zahn. Steve Zahn.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.931
He's an actor I admire.
Love that guy!

05:56.932 --> 05:59.333
Hey, Mickey, uh, can we talk
to you in private for a second?

05:59.334 --> 06:01.135
Sure, sure, sure.
Step into my office.

06:01.136 --> 06:02.136
Like it?
You guys comfortable?

06:02.137 --> 06:03.837
Can I get anybody a water?

06:03.838 --> 06:06.640
We're good. Mickey, what
would you say if I told you

06:06.641 --> 06:08.409
somebody found something... I'm in.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.910
Hold on. There's more. Oh, great.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.445
So, there's this thing that comes out

06:11.446 --> 06:13.113
of whales' butts called ambergris.

06:13.114 --> 06:14.949
But little problem:
It's illegal to buy and sell.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.150
Enter, you.

06:16.184 --> 06:17.952
Okay, gang, I'm intrigued.

06:17.953 --> 06:21.422
But I don't know...
I left the criminal life behind.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.090
Good for you.
I used to be a thumbsucker

06:23.091 --> 06:24.792
and then I stopped, so I get it.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.293
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey!

06:26.294 --> 06:28.562
Come on, man.
It's one last job.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.332
This is my last job.
This is my last job moment.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.968
This is the one I do and then
I die or go to jail at the end.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.636
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

06:35.637 --> 06:37.838
This is the one you do
and then you are golden.

06:37.872 --> 06:41.842
Oh, okay. If I help, I'd get some
kind of finder's fee, right?

06:41.843 --> 06:44.345
Maybe, like, uh...
I don't know, ten percent?

06:44.379 --> 06:46.614
What?! I mean...
yeah, sure.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.881
That would help me buy my bar.

06:47.882 --> 06:49.350
I want to get a bunch of monkeys.

06:49.351 --> 06:51.785
Call it the Monkey Bar.
Or... ooh... or crows!

06:51.786 --> 06:54.955
I could call it
the Bar with All the Crows.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.790
That's beautiful, Mickey.
I love your dreams.

06:56.825 --> 06:59.793
(children screaming)
Oh, I got to go, I got to go.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.829
Sorry, kids!
Bonus round, right?

07:01.863 --> 07:04.298
I'm back!
Felix. Hi.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.166
Are you here to tell us
the plumber is coming?

07:06.167 --> 07:09.370
To fix the hot brown water?
No. Because the hot brown water

07:09.371 --> 07:11.639
is just the tip of
the hot brown iceberg.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.940
I was just about to call the plumber.

07:12.941 --> 07:14.875
Then I thought,
"That's thinking small."

07:14.910 --> 07:16.977
Calling a plumber is thinking small?

07:17.012 --> 07:19.780
Tiny! We're gonna give
your bathroom a total remodel.

07:19.781 --> 07:21.582
Oh! Wow. The bathroom's fine.

07:21.583 --> 07:24.018
It's just the water that
needs to be not brown.

07:24.019 --> 07:26.420
Yep!
A total <i> renovación!</i>

07:26.421 --> 07:28.422
My brother will flip.
He'll be like, "Whoa!"

07:28.423 --> 07:31.592
And I'll be like, "Yeah! Calvin!
I friggin' did it!"

07:31.593 --> 07:34.261
And then he'll be like,
"Oh, that's nice." Um...

07:34.262 --> 07:36.363
So where is the latrine?
Let me see it.

07:36.364 --> 07:37.865
Over there.
It's-it's over there.

07:37.899 --> 07:40.868
Oh, God! It's horrible!

07:40.902 --> 07:43.704
It's not that bad.
Wait, let me look at it one more time.

07:43.705 --> 07:44.939
Oh, my God!
LINDA: Oh!

07:44.973 --> 07:46.740
First, we're gonna
tear everything out.

07:46.741 --> 07:48.542
Yeah!
Then we're gonna burn

07:48.543 --> 07:50.144
that sad little poop
corner to the ground.

07:50.145 --> 07:51.712
Yeah, burn it! Oh.
I don't think that's...

07:51.713 --> 07:53.414
Burn, baby, burn!
No.

07:53.448 --> 07:54.882
And, in its place, we will build

07:54.883 --> 07:57.017
a bathroom where anything can happen.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.986
(Linda gasps in awe)
Babies will be born!

07:59.020 --> 08:01.388
Aw, babies. All right. Men will die!

08:01.423 --> 08:04.358
They're gonna die. Maybe just fix
the plumbing and then do the...

08:04.359 --> 08:06.594
It's a new day, people.
It's a new day.

08:06.595 --> 08:08.696
You can't hurt us again,
bathroom! Never again!

08:08.697 --> 08:10.431
Oh, my God.

08:10.432 --> 08:12.534
Sleep tight, little ambergris lump.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.034
Good night, ambergris.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.502
(kissing) Mmm...

08:15.503 --> 08:16.871
Gene, no licking!

08:16.872 --> 08:19.206
Hey, what?! The lump
made the first move!

08:19.207 --> 08:21.442
I'll tuck it in. Ow.
Everyone say good night

08:21.443 --> 08:22.943
without touching it or licking it

08:22.944 --> 08:24.879
or hurting its value
on the black market.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.947
Say good night! Good night.
Good night.

08:26.948 --> 08:29.750
Okay, now walk away. Ambergris,
I'm gonna eat some old cheese,

08:29.751 --> 08:31.886
but I'll be thinking of you.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.288
(creaking)

08:35.557 --> 08:38.558
What? Who's there?
What's that?

08:39.594 --> 08:41.662
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

08:41.663 --> 08:44.063
(cackling)

08:46.234 --> 08:48.068
Thirty. Thousand.
Dollars.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.070
Thirty.
Thousand. Dollars.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.573
(quiet crazed laughter)

08:53.675 --> 08:54.942
Put it on the boat, Hovig.

08:54.943 --> 08:56.277
Put the tile on the boat.

08:56.278 --> 08:58.279
Hovig, calm down.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.514
You know me;
I'm not gonna burn you on this.

09:00.515 --> 09:01.916
Ho... Talk to him, Linda, please.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.185
Hovig, listen to me.
He won't burn you.

09:04.186 --> 09:05.352
Wait, wait, who's Hovig?

09:05.353 --> 09:07.154
Felix, how long is this gonna take?

09:07.155 --> 09:08.522
We need a bathroom.

09:08.523 --> 09:10.457
Some people come here
just for the bathroom.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.294
And I say, "Customers only,"
then they buy a soda.

09:13.295 --> 09:14.929
Bob, shh, it's the tile guy, come on.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.797
Okay, if you could
just give me a ballpark

09:16.798 --> 09:19.466
of when this will be done...
Okay. Thank you, Hovig!

09:19.467 --> 09:21.702
I love you, honey!
She's great with Hovig.

09:21.703 --> 09:24.438
Did you sleep at all last night,
Louise? Sleep? Ha.

09:24.472 --> 09:26.440
Soon I'll have people
who do my sleeping for me!

09:26.441 --> 09:27.608
(phone rings)

09:27.642 --> 09:29.443
Bob's Burgers!
Whoa.

09:29.477 --> 09:31.645
Louise, it's Mickey!
Oh, hi, girl

09:31.646 --> 09:33.547
who sits behind me in math class.

09:33.548 --> 09:35.683
What? No, no, it's Mickey!
Brown hair?

09:35.684 --> 09:37.985
Hands a little bit small, out
of proportion with his body?

09:37.986 --> 09:41.121
Yeah, yeah, what's the
good word, math class friend?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.122
Oh! You're being discreet.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.824
I should do that.

09:43.825 --> 09:47.127
Anyway, good news: I found
somebody to move the ambergris!

09:47.162 --> 09:48.963
(quietly): You did? Who?
You're not gonna believe it,

09:48.964 --> 09:51.699
the fried dough guy. He works
right near the Queezy Queen.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.701
Really? You found someone
at Wonder Wharf?

09:53.735 --> 09:56.337
Uh, don't be alarmed
but pretty much everyone working

09:56.338 --> 09:57.972
at Wonder Wharf is a criminal.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.473
Even Sally the snow cone lady?

09:59.508 --> 10:02.142
Are you kidding? Especially
Sally the snow cone lady.

10:02.177 --> 10:03.377
Okay.
Well, let's go see your guy.

10:03.411 --> 10:04.912
Whoa, whoa, whoa, compadre.

10:04.913 --> 10:06.747
I-I got to wait till my next break.

10:06.748 --> 10:08.983
Can we say 3:00-ish?
You want to meet here

10:08.984 --> 10:10.451
and then we'll head over
and see the Nose?

10:10.485 --> 10:11.418
Who's the Nose?

10:11.453 --> 10:12.853
That's my guy.

10:12.854 --> 10:14.588
He's got an amazing sense of smell.

10:14.589 --> 10:16.724
Oh, that's why they call him
the Nose! I just got it.

10:16.725 --> 10:19.193
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And...?
Well, he can verify the ambergris,

10:19.194 --> 10:21.195
and if he likes what he smells,
he'll buy it off you

10:21.196 --> 10:22.830
right on the spot.
Ten percent to me,

10:22.831 --> 10:24.832
we go our separate ways.
Or hang out!

10:24.833 --> 10:26.867
I don't know what you guys
are up to, but I'm just...

10:26.902 --> 10:28.569
Gotta go.
Wait for further instruction.

10:28.570 --> 10:31.572
Bye!
Kids meeting. Upstairs. Now.

10:31.573 --> 10:33.407
We've been having
a lot of kid meetings.

10:33.408 --> 10:35.843
This is why we need a conference room.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.778
Mickey told me the name of his connect

10:37.779 --> 10:40.281
and where he works,
so it's sayonara, Mickey!

10:40.282 --> 10:42.583
What are you saying, Louise?
We're cutting out Mickey?

10:42.584 --> 10:44.718
He cut himself out
by giving us the information.

10:44.719 --> 10:47.087
It's not my fault
he's bad at being a criminal.

10:47.088 --> 10:49.423
But Mickey was gonna use
that money to go straight.

10:49.424 --> 10:50.958
He was gonna open that straight bar.

10:50.959 --> 10:52.860
Okay, Tina, you're too emotional.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.396
You just bought yourself
a ticket to Not-Goingsville.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.298
Gene, let's go.
Here, I'll hold the lump.

10:57.299 --> 11:00.401
No way, Gene. I've seen how
you hold it... in your mouth.

11:00.402 --> 11:02.736
It needs to be stored
at mouth temperature!

11:02.737 --> 11:04.438
You know what?
I'm going alone!

11:04.439 --> 11:06.907
I'm taking charge
so you two won't screw this up!

11:06.908 --> 11:09.376
You want to end up like Mickey?
Five-foot-ten?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.679
Comfortable in his own skin?
No! Cut out!

11:11.713 --> 11:13.715
Cut, cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut! Aah!

11:13.748 --> 11:15.483
This stuff is making you crazy!

11:15.484 --> 11:16.784
It's tearing us apart!

11:16.818 --> 11:18.586
Why couldn't that whale have pooped

11:18.587 --> 11:21.589
three equally sized poops like I do!

11:23.050 --> 11:24.216
GENE: <i>This isn't like you, Louise.</i>

11:24.251 --> 11:25.585
You used to be nice, sort of.

11:25.586 --> 11:27.720
If you're gonna sell that thing,
then you're doing it alone.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.888
Yes, that's the plan.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.690
That's exactly what I'm doing.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.925
(grunting) Wh-What are you doing?

11:32.926 --> 11:36.095
(groans) You don't walk into a
deal just holding the stuff.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.863
You tape it to your back.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.298
Watch a movie!

11:39.333 --> 11:41.000
Okay.
Let me get that for you.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.268
Thank you.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.869
(hums a tune) The tape doesn't stick.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.338
Stay still.
I'll get the duct tape

11:45.339 --> 11:47.406
Dad uses to lock
the front door at night.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.408
It's ready.
Ambergris lump secured?

11:49.443 --> 11:50.843
Check.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.712
Sample for The Nose to test? Check.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.914
I'm leaving here a girl
with a hunch on her back,

11:54.915 --> 11:57.283
but I'm coming back a girl
with a whole hunch of money.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.253
I'm mad, but I'm still
gonna wish you good luck!

12:00.287 --> 12:03.022
(singsongy): I got the deejay...

12:03.056 --> 12:06.359
Yay! Ah, the unveiling party;
It's gonna be amazing!

12:06.360 --> 12:08.461
Unveiling party?
Party time!

12:08.462 --> 12:10.396
We don't even have
a bathroom that works,

12:10.397 --> 12:11.931
and you're planning a party?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.699
By the way, the deejay
might have to stay with you.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.536
What?! Yes. He's Brazilian,
though, so, uh... very cool.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.038
No... Felix, no.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.707
The burlesque girls, you know
what, let's just have them

12:21.708 --> 12:22.875
dancing on the tables and the counter.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.877
Oh, burlesque girls!
Classy!

12:24.878 --> 12:27.580
Very classy.
Please, sir, don't encourage this.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.915
You're not in... You know what?
What?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.650
You know what we're gonna do?

12:30.651 --> 12:32.285
We're gonna have
a plumbing party, all right?

12:32.286 --> 12:33.753
With a licensed plumber.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.621
To fix the bathroom.
Not a deejay,

12:35.622 --> 12:37.456
no burlesque show.
Okay.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.158
A plumber to fix the pipe!

12:39.159 --> 12:42.261
Bobby! So no girls, then?
Or still girls?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.530
It's still happening.
I'll put you on the list.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.432
(sizzling)

12:51.471 --> 12:53.272
Fried dough?
Are you The Nose?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.341
That's what they call me.
What do they call you,

12:55.342 --> 12:56.576
Humpback Whacky Eyes?

12:56.577 --> 13:00.479
Listen, doughboy, I came to
talk to you about <i> real</i> dough.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.747
Ah, I see.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.848
You're, uh, you're early.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.483
And you're, uh, rather tiny.

13:04.518 --> 13:05.785
Yeah, yeah, I'm a little girl.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.086
Sorry I'm not huge and old.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.087
Wh-Where's Mickey?

13:08.121 --> 13:12.091
Uh, Mickey sends his regrets,
and, uh, this... hearty

13:12.092 --> 13:13.626
handshake.
Ugh!

13:13.627 --> 13:15.094
You put something gross in my hand!

13:15.095 --> 13:16.963
Oh. Okay.

13:20.601 --> 13:23.102
(sniffs) Sweet Georgia O'Keeffe!

13:23.103 --> 13:24.470
This is finely aged.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.606
(sniffs) You have the
rest of it with you?

13:26.607 --> 13:27.874
Well, do you have the money?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.976
(whispers): I want $30,000!

13:29.977 --> 13:31.444
Well, I don't have it <i> on</i> me.

13:31.445 --> 13:32.812
Then I don't have the stuff,

13:32.813 --> 13:33.980
(laughs): Do I, Nose?

13:33.981 --> 13:34.981
Oh, you know what?

13:34.982 --> 13:36.148
I just remembered.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.517
I want to the ATM yesterday.

13:37.518 --> 13:39.352
I have about $30,000 on me.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.020
Okay, great, great!
Let's do this.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.122
All right, count of three,
I give you the money,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.557
you give me the ambergris.
Sounds good.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.242
Okay. One...
Okay.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.461
...two...

13:49.396 --> 13:50.530
...three!
(grunts)

13:50.531 --> 13:51.831
It's huge!

13:51.832 --> 13:52.957
12 dollars?!

13:52.966 --> 13:55.067
Oh, is it?
Are you <i> robbing</i> me?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.636
Yeah...
What?!

13:56.637 --> 13:58.538
Mickey's not here.
You're very small.

13:58.539 --> 14:01.674
It just makes sense.
Yeah, okay, I get it, I get it.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.910
But what if I do <i> this!</i>

14:03.911 --> 14:05.144
Nope. Doesn't work.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.746
Remember?
You're small?

14:06.747 --> 14:08.047
You have to give it back!

14:08.048 --> 14:12.051
Mmm, hey, this smells like a
cantaloupe wrapped in dirty socks.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.853
It's a cantaloupe
wrapped in dirty socks!

14:13.854 --> 14:15.555
(gasps) Tina!

14:15.589 --> 14:16.923
Stay still.
I'll get the duct tape

14:16.924 --> 14:18.658
Dad uses to lock
the front door at night.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.197
TINA: <i>Dear Louise and/or The Nose,</i>

14:24.198 --> 14:26.432
<i>this is for your own good.
Also, please return</i>

14:26.433 --> 14:27.834
<i>the cantaloupe and the socks.</i>

14:27.835 --> 14:28.768
<i>Love, Tina.</i>
(Louise screams)

14:28.769 --> 14:30.002
(sniffing) You know,

14:30.003 --> 14:31.604
they're not that dirty...
you can get

14:31.605 --> 14:33.166
another day out of
these, quite frankly.

14:33.931 --> 14:36.638
Okay, okay, okay,
if I were a double-dealing

14:36.639 --> 14:37.973
goody-goody with a treasure,

14:37.974 --> 14:40.209
where would I go?
Is this a riddle?

14:40.210 --> 14:41.643
No.
Kid's book?

14:41.644 --> 14:43.846
No. And I wasn't talking to you, Nose.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.214
Sorry!
Don't you have

14:45.215 --> 14:47.249
some dough to fry?
Easy there, Blinky.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.152
I don't have dough to fry;
I <i> get</i> to fry dough.

14:50.153 --> 14:51.687
This is a dream job.

14:51.721 --> 14:53.856
I never realized
sinks could be so sexy.

14:53.857 --> 14:56.325
Oh, yes... sinks are
the supermodels of the bathroom,

14:56.326 --> 14:58.060
as I like to say.
Yeah!

14:58.061 --> 15:00.396
I call this one "Sinky Crawford."

15:00.397 --> 15:01.864
(both chuckling)

15:01.865 --> 15:03.065
Sinky Craw...
Do you?

15:03.066 --> 15:04.153
Yeah.
Do you?

15:04.167 --> 15:05.601
Yeah!
That's great.

15:05.602 --> 15:07.436
That's so great.
Get it? Sink...

15:07.437 --> 15:08.437
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Like...

15:08.438 --> 15:10.673
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha.

15:10.674 --> 15:13.075
Ha...! I am so sick of your attitude.

15:13.076 --> 15:15.878
BOB: Oh, yeah, it's <i> my</i> fault.
Come here, Bob...

15:15.879 --> 15:17.579
Bobby, wait,
I didn't mean that. Bobby!

15:17.580 --> 15:19.682
Oh, my God!
♪ Look at this one! ♪

15:19.683 --> 15:21.750
Oh, yeah!
Hubba hubba.

15:21.785 --> 15:23.385
Are you sure we should do this, T?

15:23.386 --> 15:25.888
Yes. I know how we can still
use the lump for good.

15:25.889 --> 15:27.523
Mickey can sell it and open his bar.

15:27.524 --> 15:29.058
The bar with the monkeys
and the crows!

15:29.059 --> 15:31.093
It's what the world needs now!

15:31.127 --> 15:32.961
Don't worry about that sound...
that's nothin'!

15:32.962 --> 15:34.797
(brief whirr) <i>That</i> one,
ooh, that's new.

15:34.798 --> 15:36.231
I got to report that one.

15:36.232 --> 15:37.900
(panting): Mickey... Louise...
Hi.

15:37.901 --> 15:39.968
she's meeting with the Nose right now.

15:39.969 --> 15:42.504
Uh-oh. (chuckles) Crossed wires alert.

15:42.539 --> 15:45.007
No. Louise cut you out.
She cheated you.

15:45.041 --> 15:47.242
(inhales) Ooh, that stings.

15:47.243 --> 15:49.178
But I'm giving you
the lump, all of it.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.813
You can use the money to go straight.

15:50.814 --> 15:52.715
Buy a juicer... it'll
change your mornings.

15:52.716 --> 15:55.117
Or cowboy boots.
Mm, change your evenings.

15:55.151 --> 15:56.952
I'm honored, and I accept your offer.

15:56.953 --> 15:59.922
And I know exactly
how I'm gonna go straight.

15:59.923 --> 16:02.224
Yeah, your dream...
the Monkey and/or Crow Bar.

16:02.225 --> 16:04.827
Nope. I'm gonna use the
money to buy a tank.

16:04.828 --> 16:06.895
Uh-huh...
And then I could use the tank

16:06.896 --> 16:08.797
Uh-huh.
to rob a bank!

16:08.798 --> 16:10.933
Uh... Oh. I'll be Mickey Tank-Bank!

16:10.934 --> 16:13.168
No!
Yes! Mickey Tank-Bank!

16:13.169 --> 16:15.004
Aah! I shouldn't have come here!
Why, whale?

16:15.005 --> 16:18.774
Why did you curse us with this poop
or wax or whatever it is? Aah!

16:18.808 --> 16:20.042
There's only one thing to do:

16:20.043 --> 16:21.744
We have to destroy the ambergris.

16:21.778 --> 16:23.512
Whoa, hey, wait-wait-wait!
I was just getting

16:23.513 --> 16:24.980
to the "going straight" thing.

16:24.981 --> 16:26.882
I'm gonna do that after the bank.

16:26.883 --> 16:28.817
Tina, where are you going?

16:28.818 --> 16:30.653
LOUISE: Oh, my God, there she is!

16:30.654 --> 16:32.488
(both panting)

16:32.522 --> 16:35.024
Tina! Sister!

16:35.025 --> 16:36.191
Ah, my only sister,

16:36.192 --> 16:37.960
there you are.
Hi, Tina.

16:37.961 --> 16:39.962
We haven't met yet, but I really want

16:39.963 --> 16:41.830
that thing you're holding.
Everybody get back!

16:41.865 --> 16:43.799
I'm gonna throw
the ambergris in the water.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.835
No! Whatever you do,
don't throw it in the <i> water.</i>

16:46.836 --> 16:49.805
Anything but the water!

16:49.806 --> 16:51.440
Wait. Doesn't ambergris float?

16:51.441 --> 16:53.309
Oh.
(frustrated yell)

16:53.310 --> 16:54.977
TINA: No! Aah!

16:54.978 --> 16:57.146
Stop her!
She stole my baby!

16:57.147 --> 17:00.015
Seagulls! Swarm attack!

17:00.016 --> 17:02.051
Aah!
I thought that would work.

17:02.052 --> 17:04.619
Hot... hot pier!
Ooh! Ah! Ow! Ow!

17:04.621 --> 17:07.423
(Tina yelling)

17:07.457 --> 17:08.757
Aw...

17:08.791 --> 17:09.791
LOUISE: We got her.

17:09.792 --> 17:11.593
Nowhere else to go, Tina.

17:11.627 --> 17:13.395
Hand it over.
I want that money!

17:13.396 --> 17:15.297
(jabbering, growling)

17:15.298 --> 17:17.766
What? What part of

don't you understand?!

17:19.169 --> 17:21.170
(panicked grunting, gasping)

17:21.171 --> 17:22.204
TINA: Huh-huh.

17:22.238 --> 17:23.372
(sizzling)

17:23.406 --> 17:24.707
Mmm, ah!

17:32.801 --> 17:35.117

17:35.151 --> 17:36.552
It's for the best.

17:36.553 --> 17:38.554
Can I have the socks
and cantaloupe back?

17:38.555 --> 17:40.322
I'll check in about it later.

17:40.323 --> 17:41.991
(lively Latin music playing)

17:42.025 --> 17:43.559
Everybody having a good time?

17:43.560 --> 17:45.561
I... know you are!

17:45.562 --> 17:47.529
FELIX: Can you drape it more casually?

17:47.564 --> 17:49.265
Like, "Oh, I'm just
a ribbon, no big deal."

17:49.266 --> 17:51.634
Uh, sure, yeah. How's this?
Beautiful.

17:51.668 --> 17:56.038
Hey... so, I had a little
time to think, and I...

17:56.039 --> 17:58.741
guess I was a tiny bit out of control

17:58.742 --> 18:02.778
the other day, you know,
with the, uh... (snorts)

18:02.779 --> 18:04.747
You know, uh, the ambergris.

18:04.781 --> 18:05.981
Huh. I didn't notice.

18:05.982 --> 18:07.716
Oh, seriously?
No, I noticed.

18:07.717 --> 18:09.451
Oh. You were really,
really out of control.

18:09.452 --> 18:11.253
I don't know, I miss
twitch-face Louise.

18:11.254 --> 18:17.726
Well, Gene, that's what happens
when you fry $30,000 in hot oil!

18:17.761 --> 18:19.228
There it is...
there's Twitchy.

18:19.229 --> 18:20.629
I'm fine. I'm good.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.765
I'm just twitching to the music.

18:22.799 --> 18:24.667
So, is this, uh, the unveiling?

18:24.701 --> 18:26.035
BOB: Yep.
How's it looking?

18:26.036 --> 18:27.236
Haven't seen it.

18:27.237 --> 18:28.604
Not feeling great about that.

18:28.605 --> 18:29.805
Doesn't seem to matter to anybody.

18:29.806 --> 18:30.806
The deejay slept in my living room.

18:30.807 --> 18:32.775
Bob!
BOB: Sergio.

18:32.776 --> 18:34.109
Hey, Mr. Fisch. Wine?

18:34.110 --> 18:35.945
Calvin. Welcome.
Was it easy to get in?

18:35.946 --> 18:37.546
I left your name at the door.

18:37.547 --> 18:39.415
Not bad, huh? You know,
I'm kind of glad

18:39.416 --> 18:41.283
the burlesque dancers
didn't show. Heh!

18:41.284 --> 18:43.085
They didn't want to dance
at a bathroom party.

18:43.086 --> 18:46.422
What are they, royalty?
Anyway, let's unveil this baby.

18:46.423 --> 18:48.157
Okay, uh...
(clears throat)

18:48.158 --> 18:49.758
Oh, God, I'm nervous.

18:49.759 --> 18:50.759
(sighs anxiously)

18:50.760 --> 18:52.661
The new, improved

18:52.662 --> 18:56.498
Bob's-Restaurant-
that-sells-burgers <i> ba-throom!</i>

18:56.499 --> 18:58.534
Oh, my God.

18:58.568 --> 19:01.270
Oh... my God.
Which is the sink?

19:01.304 --> 19:03.939
Which is the toilet?
I'd pee in <i> that.</i> Or that.

19:03.974 --> 19:07.076
It doesn't quite match the
rest of the restaurant.

19:07.077 --> 19:08.510
Calm down, Bob.

19:08.511 --> 19:10.312
I didn't forget you and your concerns.

19:10.313 --> 19:12.481
So the water works?
Oh, was that one of your concerns?

19:12.515 --> 19:13.949
Yeah. It was.

19:13.984 --> 19:15.117
Hold that thought.
Calvin...

19:15.118 --> 19:16.352
Hmm?
what do you think?

19:16.353 --> 19:18.153
Do you love it or do you love it?

19:18.188 --> 19:20.422
What were my choices again?
You hate it.

19:20.423 --> 19:22.324
No.
You do. You hate it.

19:22.325 --> 19:24.693
You hate it, too, Bob, don't you?
Yes, I do, hate it.

19:24.694 --> 19:26.595
You think it's stupid.
Too gaudy.

19:26.596 --> 19:27.863
Too much black!

19:27.864 --> 19:29.298
Not <i> all</i> those things.

19:29.299 --> 19:30.799
You never support me!

19:30.800 --> 19:32.768
Felix, you're being dramatic.

19:32.802 --> 19:34.270
I'm not being dramatic!

19:34.271 --> 19:36.539
I just feel like
I'm gonna throw up my heart

19:36.540 --> 19:38.908
and my head will fly away like a bird!

19:38.942 --> 19:41.577
So, you got your bathroom done.

19:41.611 --> 19:42.978
FELIX: I'm gonna rip it all out!

19:43.013 --> 19:45.614
Mr. Fischoeder,
can you do something about this?

19:45.615 --> 19:47.016
What, Felix? Oh.

19:47.017 --> 19:48.684
Yes. Step aside.
Watch this.

19:48.685 --> 19:50.352
(rhythmic beat)

19:50.353 --> 19:51.987
Now you guys say: It's Felix,
