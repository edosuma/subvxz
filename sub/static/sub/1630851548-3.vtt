EVERYONE ELSE TO GET VACCINATED

BUT YOU NOT TO BE AND IF THAT

HEARD YOU SAY YOU WOULD LIKE THE

09:32.100 --> 09:34.259
OLDER ONE BECAUSE THE NEW ONE IS

09:34.279 --> 09:36.019
JUST SO NEW.

09:36.039 --> 09:37.279
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, ASTRAZENECA

09:38.000 --> 09:39.259
IS NOT A FULLY TRADITIONAL

09:39.279 --> 09:40.029
VIRUS.

09:40.049 --> 09:41.259
IT USES A METHOD OF DELIVERY

09:41.279 --> 09:43.169
THAT IS MORE TRADITIONAL AND HAS

09:43.190 --> 09:44.200
BEEN USED FOR LONGER.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.029
>> Bill: IT'S A PIECE OF THE

09:46.049 --> 09:47.250
REAL VIRUS, RIGHT?

09:47.269 --> 09:51.039
>> YOU HAVE THE DELIVERY

09:51.059 --> 09:55.080
MECHANISM, BUT THE VIRUSES

09:55.100 --> 10:02.029
UNRELATED TO SARS COVID 2, IT

10:02.049 --> 10:03.129
MANUFACTURES PIECES OF THE

10:03.149 --> 10:05.019
CORONAVIRUS, THE SPIKE PROTEIN

10:05.039 --> 10:05.190
WHICH HOPEFULLY THE IMMUNE

10:05.210 --> 10:07.000
SYSTEM LEARNS TO RECOGNIZE.

10:07.019 --> 10:10.220
THERE IS NO DANGER OF GETTING

10:10.240 --> 10:13.240
SARS-COV-2 BECAUSE THE VIRUS

10:13.259 --> 10:15.269
SUDDENLY COMES BACK TO LIFE.

10:15.289 --> 10:18.049
THIS VIRUS DOESN'T CARRY THAT

10:18.070 --> 10:18.129
CAPACITY.

10:18.149 --> 10:21.259
WE HAVE A LONG EVOLUTIONARY

10:21.279 --> 10:22.250
HISTORY WITH THESE VIRUSES, THEY

10:22.269 --> 10:24.080
CAUSE THINGS LIKE THE COMMON

10:24.100 --> 10:25.029
COLD, IT'S NOT VERY SERIOUS EVEN

10:25.049 --> 10:27.230
IF SOMETHING WERE TO OCCUR.

10:27.250 --> 10:30.019
IN SOME WAYS THE SIMPLE FACT

10:30.039 --> 10:31.000
THAT IT'S USING A VIRUS TO

10:31.019 --> 10:34.179
DELIVER THE DNA RATHER THAN A

10:34.200 --> 10:38.259
NOVEL MANUFACTURED COAT OF

10:38.279 --> 10:39.190
LIPIDS, THESE NANOPARTICLES

10:39.210 --> 10:41.210
WHICH IS WHAT THE MRNA VACCINES

10:41.230 --> 10:42.149
ARE USING, THAT'S A NOVEL

10:42.169 --> 10:43.230
TECHNOLOGY, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

10:43.250 --> 10:44.240
ITS IMPLICATIONS ARE BECAUSE IT

10:44.259 --> 10:48.009
HASN'T BEEN USED IN HUMANS.

10:48.029 --> 10:49.029
>> Bill: RECREATE A LITTLE BIT

10:49.049 --> 10:52.080
OF THAT CONVERSATION FOR ME

10:52.100 --> 10:54.019
ABOUT -- YOU'RE A SCIENTIST, YOU

10:54.039 --> 10:55.230
KNOW THIS STUFF REAL WELL.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.279
YOU'RE JUST SAYING -- I'VE HEARD

10:58.000 --> 11:02.190
YOU SAY IT'S NOT SCIENCE

11:02.210 --> 11:04.279
FICTION, IT'S SCIENCE FACT, THE

11:05.000 --> 11:06.240
OLD ONE.

11:06.259 --> 11:09.269
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE

11:09.289 --> 11:10.149
ASTRAZENECA VACCINE IS NOT A

11:10.169 --> 11:14.090
TRADITIONAL VACCINE.

11:14.110 --> 11:17.139
IT USES A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT

11:17.159 --> 11:18.169
ALSO USES AN OLDER TECHNOLOGY

11:18.190 --> 11:19.200
THAT WE HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE

11:19.220 --> 11:20.090
WITH, IT'S NOT A FULLY

11:20.110 --> 11:23.009
TRADITIONAL VACCINE.

11:23.029 --> 11:24.200
THERE ARE ALSO SOME OF THOSE --

11:24.220 --> 11:25.200
>> Bill: THAT'S THE ONE YOU

11:25.220 --> 11:26.059
WOULD PREFER.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.129
>> THE OLDER IT IS, THE MORE

11:29.149 --> 11:30.230
COMMONLY WE HAVE ALREADY USED

11:30.250 --> 11:33.019
IT, THE MORE LIKELY WE ALL

11:33.039 --> 11:35.169
SHOULD BE TO TRUST IT SIMPLY

11:35.190 --> 11:39.019
BECAUSE THE DATA ALREADY EXISTS.

11:39.039 --> 11:41.120
MRNA VACCINES UNTIL 2020, THEY

11:41.139 --> 11:42.250
HAD NEVER BEEN IN HUMANS BEFORE.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.120
WE ARE HOPING, BOTH OF US, WE

11:44.139 --> 11:47.159
ARE SCIENTISTS, WE'VE GOT MORE

11:47.179 --> 11:48.049
VACCINATIONS IN ALMOST ANY ONE

11:48.070 --> 11:49.149
GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT YELLOW

11:49.169 --> 11:51.190
FEVER AND RABIES IN ALL OF THESE

11:51.210 --> 11:52.009
THINGS.

11:52.029 --> 11:52.120
>> Bill: RABIES?

11:52.139 --> 11:57.250
>> YUP.

11:57.269 --> 12:00.190
IN ORDER TO WORK ON BATS IN THE

12:00.210 --> 12:01.070
NEO-TROPICS, WE'VE BEEN

12:01.090 --> 12:02.090
VACCINATED AGAINST RABIES AND

12:02.110 --> 12:04.059
YELLOW FEVER AND A NUMBER OF

12:04.080 --> 12:05.250
THINGS THAT MOST AMERICANS EVER

12:05.269 --> 12:06.029
RUN INTO.

12:06.049 --> 12:07.110
>> Bill: YOU MENTION BATS, LET

12:07.129 --> 12:09.070
ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.029
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT RECENTLY

12:10.049 --> 12:11.070
THAT MAYBE THE VIRUS DID START

12:11.090 --> 12:15.240
IN A LAB, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT,

12:15.259 --> 12:17.149
THE FACT THAT THERE IS THIS LAB,

12:17.169 --> 12:18.190
I THINK IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF THE

12:18.210 --> 12:27.149
WORLD QUITE LIKE IT IN WUHAN --

12:27.169 --> 12:29.139
IT WOULD ALMOST BE A CONSPIRACY

12:29.159 --> 12:32.080
THEORY THAT DIDN'T START IN THE

12:32.100 --> 12:32.139
LAB.

12:32.159 --> 12:37.220
THAT WAS DEMONIZED, IT'S CAN.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.129
CONSPIRACY THINKING.

12:41.149 --> 12:41.269
IT'S CERTAINLY 50/50?

12:41.289 --> 12:43.289
>> IT'S PHARMA LIVE GIVEN THAT,

12:44.009 --> 12:45.129
I THINK IN JUNE THE CHANCES IT

12:45.149 --> 12:48.159
CAME FROM A LAB LOOK TO ME TO BE

12:48.179 --> 12:49.200
ABOUT 90%.

12:49.220 --> 12:51.190
THIS WAS NEVER A CONSPIRACY

12:51.210 --> 12:52.279
THEORY, THAT TERM IS SIMPLY USED

12:53.000 --> 12:55.120
TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.

12:55.139 --> 12:58.019
IT'S AN OBVIOUS HYPOTHESIS THAT

12:58.039 --> 13:00.100
IS IN NEED OF TESTING AND WE ARE

13:00.120 --> 13:02.070
ONLY NOW A YEAR IN GETTING TO

13:02.090 --> 13:03.190
THE POINT WHERE WE CAN DISCUSS

13:03.210 --> 13:05.090
IT OUT LOUD WITHOUT BEING

13:05.110 --> 13:05.179
STIGMATIZED.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.059
>> THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT

13:09.080 --> 13:10.230
WE ARE SO POLITICIZED, SO PART

13:10.250 --> 13:14.009
AS AS A COUNTRY THAT IF THE

13:14.029 --> 13:16.120
WRONG GUY PROPOSE THIS TO BEGIN

13:16.139 --> 13:17.240
WITH AND FOR HALF THE COUNTRY IT

13:17.259 --> 13:20.000
WAS THE WRONG GUY, THE REST OF

13:20.019 --> 13:21.169
THE COUNTRY SAYS NO WAY,

13:21.190 --> 13:23.200
KNOW-HOW, WE ARE GOING TO CALL

13:23.220 --> 13:24.110
THAT A CONSPIRACY THEORY AND WE

13:24.129 --> 13:26.250
ARE NEVER GOING TO REVISIT IT.

13:26.269 --> 13:28.049
THE FACT IS THAT'S NOT HOW

13:28.070 --> 13:31.279
SCIENCE WORKS, YOU NEED TO SAY

13:32.000 --> 13:33.129
I'VE GOT A PATTERN, I NEED TO

13:33.149 --> 13:35.080
MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS AND I'M

13:35.100 --> 13:37.000
GOING TO CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBLE

13:37.019 --> 13:37.289
EXPLANATION ON THE TABLE AND DID

13:38.009 --> 13:39.110
IT LEAK FROM A LAB?

13:39.129 --> 13:40.120
THAT WAS CLEARLY FROM THE

13:40.139 --> 13:42.169
BEGINNING OF POSSIBILITY.

13:42.190 --> 13:43.220
>> Bill: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

13:43.240 --> 13:47.179
AT FIRST I WAS GOING TO SAY I

13:47.200 --> 13:49.179
WANT THE MRNA, IT'S NEW, AN

13:49.200 --> 13:50.059
IMPROVEMENT OVER THE OLD ONES,

13:50.080 --> 13:54.120
THEN I HEARD YOU SAY EVEN THOUGH

13:54.139 --> 13:55.190
YOU'RE A LITTLE SQUARELY ABOUT

13:55.210 --> 13:57.159
IT TONIGHT, I HEARD YOU SAY YOU

13:57.179 --> 13:59.000
WANT THE ONE THEY HAVE THE PEACE

13:59.019 --> 14:00.100
OF THE VIRUS IN IT, THE WAY THEY

14:00.120 --> 14:02.070
DID IT FOR MANY YEARS.

14:02.090 --> 14:05.029
THEN I HEARD ABOUT THE LAB AND I

14:05.049 --> 14:06.200
WAS LIKE IF THEY MADE THAT ONE

14:06.220 --> 14:10.019
IN A LAB, DO I REALLY WANT A

14:10.039 --> 14:12.009
PIECE OF THAT VIRUS AND MAY?

14:12.029 --> 14:13.279
IS IT POSSIBLE THERE'S SOMETHING

14:14.000 --> 14:15.250
IN A LAB MADE VIRUS THAT IS

14:15.269 --> 14:17.240
DIFFERENT THAT WOULD MAKE A

14:17.259 --> 14:18.169
VACCINE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES

14:18.190 --> 14:20.259
WE'VE HAD FOR DECADES WHICH WERE

14:20.279 --> 14:21.149
MADE FROM VIRUSES THAT OCCURRED

14:21.169 --> 14:23.080
IN NATURE?

14:23.100 --> 14:27.059
>> THIS IS A COMPLEX TOPIC.

14:27.080 --> 14:27.279
>> Bill: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

14:28.009 --> 14:28.049
HERE.

14:28.070 --> 14:29.139
>> RIGHT.

14:29.159 --> 14:33.250
THE ADENOVIRUS IS THE ONE YOU

14:33.269 --> 14:34.269
HAVE A HISTORY WITH AT LEAST

14:34.289 --> 14:36.110
VIRUSES IN THAT FAMILY.

14:36.129 --> 14:39.250
YOU'RE VERY UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY

14:39.269 --> 14:41.259
EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY WITH THE

14:41.279 --> 14:43.289
BETA CORONA VIRUSES WHICH IS THE

14:44.009 --> 14:47.129
ONES SARS-COV-2 COME FROM --

14:47.149 --> 14:48.019
WHAT UNEXPECTED MIGHT HAPPEN IF

14:48.039 --> 14:50.059
WE GIVE YOU THE ADENOVIRUS

14:50.080 --> 14:52.009
VACCINE, IT'S MUCH LESS LIKELY

14:52.029 --> 14:53.139
TO BE DRAMATIC THAN LIPID

14:53.159 --> 14:57.019
NANOPARTICLES WHICH IS WHAT THE

14:57.039 --> 15:01.139
MRNA VIRUSES ARE PACKAGED IN.

15:01.159 --> 15:05.190
AS FAR AS THE DNA, OR RNA, THEY

15:05.210 --> 15:07.200
PRODUCE THE SAME PROTEINS.

15:07.220 --> 15:12.259
THE TARGET IS -- THE VIRUS IS

15:12.279 --> 15:14.019
WRAPPED IN SPIKE PROTEINS AND

15:14.039 --> 15:16.139
THE IDEA IS TO GIVE THOSE SPIKE

15:16.159 --> 15:19.019
PROTEINS TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SO

15:19.039 --> 15:19.169
THAT IT RECOGNIZES THEM

15:19.190 --> 15:21.110
IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EVER GET

15:21.129 --> 15:21.190
INFECTED.

15:21.210 --> 15:24.190
FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW, THE

15:24.210 --> 15:26.159
VACCINES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

15:26.179 --> 15:28.019
AVAILABLE ARE EQUIVALENT, ALL

15:28.039 --> 15:28.159
DELIVERING.

15:28.179 --> 15:29.049
>> Bill: YOU'RE NOT WORRIED IF

15:29.070 --> 15:31.289
IT WAS MADE IN A LAB IT WOULD BE

15:32.009 --> 15:34.039
DIFFERENT, THAT A VACCINE WOULD

15:34.059 --> 15:35.179
BE DIFFERENT MADE FROM THAT CAME

15:35.200 --> 15:37.000
FROM A LAB INSTEAD OF NATURE

15:37.019 --> 15:40.169
ITSELF -- THE LAB IS TAKING

15:40.190 --> 15:41.259
NATURE ITSELF, OF COURSE BUT

15:41.279 --> 15:42.179
THAT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.240
>> ALL OF OUR BEST TRICKS, WE

15:44.259 --> 15:46.000
ARE BORROWING FROM NATURE AND WE

15:46.019 --> 15:47.070
ARE TAKING THAT SPIKE PROTEIN

15:47.090 --> 15:48.269
AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET IT

15:48.289 --> 15:50.049
INTO YOUR CELLS SO YOUR IMMUNE

15:50.070 --> 15:52.250
SYSTEM GETS A CHANCE TO SEE IT.

15:52.269 --> 15:53.269
>> Bill: LET'S ASSUME THE

15:53.289 --> 15:55.179
CHINESE WERE NOT TRYING TO

15:55.200 --> 15:57.230
CREATE A BIO WEAPON, IT'S

15:57.250 --> 15:59.059
POSSIBLE THEY WERE -- IF THEY

15:59.080 --> 16:02.179
WERE, THEY DID A HELL OF A JOB

16:02.200 --> 16:03.200
BECAUSE THEY SHUT DOWN THE WORLD

16:03.220 --> 16:04.210
BUT LET'S ASSUME THEY WERE JUST

16:04.230 --> 16:07.259
STUDYING THIS FOR EDUCATIONAL

16:07.279 --> 16:09.220
REASONS BUT IT GOT OUT.

16:09.240 --> 16:14.070
MAYBE LIKE ON A WORKER'S LIKE

16:14.090 --> 16:15.080
WHEN THE BUSBOY DOESN'T WASH HIS

16:15.100 --> 16:19.139
HANDS BEFORE HE GOES THE BACK

16:19.159 --> 16:20.259
BATHROOM AND THEN YOU GET FOOD

16:20.279 --> 16:22.289
POISONING BUT FOR THE WHOLE

16:23.009 --> 16:24.019
WORLD.

16:24.039 --> 16:27.190
SO IT GOT OUT, IT RAISES THE

16:27.210 --> 16:29.179
QUESTION, SHOULD WE EVER BE

16:29.200 --> 16:31.110
STUDYING VIRUSES IN LABS THIS

16:31.129 --> 16:31.159
WAY?

16:31.179 --> 16:32.210
IF WE ARE JUST GOING TO CREATE

16:32.230 --> 16:35.179
THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE TRYING

16:35.200 --> 16:35.240
TO --

16:35.259 --> 16:38.100
>> THAT BATTLES TAKING PLACE

16:38.120 --> 16:41.220
BEFORE THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.159
THERE WERE TWO FACTIONS, THERE

16:43.179 --> 16:44.259
WAS A FACTION THAT SAID WE HAD

16:44.279 --> 16:47.029
NO CHOICE BUT TO STUDY THESE

16:47.049 --> 16:50.080
VIRUSES AND TO ENGAGE IN

16:50.100 --> 16:51.190
RESEARCH WHERE WE TURBOCHARGE

16:51.210 --> 16:53.250
THE VIRUSES AND MAKE THEM MUCH

16:53.269 --> 16:55.159
MORE DANGEROUS, THE ARGUMENT WAS

16:55.179 --> 16:56.129
WE HAD TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO

16:56.149 --> 16:58.110
KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE IN

16:58.129 --> 17:01.159
THEIR DANGEROUS FORM AND COULD

17:01.179 --> 17:02.259
PERHAPS PREPARE BY GENERATING A

17:02.279 --> 17:03.029
VACCINE.

17:03.049 --> 17:04.119
THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER FACTION

17:04.140 --> 17:05.190
THAT SAID WE ARE LIKELY TO

17:05.210 --> 17:07.019
CREATE EXACTLY THE DISASTER WE

17:07.039 --> 17:11.009
FEAR AND WHAT WAS MISSING FROM

17:11.029 --> 17:12.250
THIS DISCUSSION WAS PROPER

17:12.269 --> 17:13.170
EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS.

17:13.190 --> 17:15.240
THE FACT IS, THERE ARE LOTS OF

17:15.259 --> 17:17.200
VIRUSES THAT CAN ESCAPE FROM

17:17.220 --> 17:19.079
NATURE AND AFFECT PEOPLE BUT IN

17:19.099 --> 17:20.190
GENERAL THEY DON'T HAVE A SECOND

17:20.210 --> 17:22.009
TRICK, THEY CAN INFECT YOU, THEY

17:22.029 --> 17:23.069
CAN MAKE YOU SICK, MAYBE THEY

17:23.089 --> 17:25.130
CAN KILL YOU, BUT THEY CAN'T

17:25.150 --> 17:27.019
JUMP TO THE NEXT PERSON.

17:27.039 --> 17:28.210
WHAT IS REALLY CONSPICUOUS ABOUT

17:28.230 --> 17:30.269
THIS VIRUS IS IT HAD BOTH TRICKS

17:30.289 --> 17:32.059
FROM THE GET-GO.

17:32.079 --> 17:33.109
IT INFECTS PEOPLE AND IT JUMPS

17:33.130 --> 17:35.170
FROM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT.

17:35.190 --> 17:37.069
>> Bill: NOW IT SEEMS TO BE

17:37.089 --> 17:39.180
HAVING A THIRD TRICK WHICH IS

17:39.200 --> 17:41.039
MUTATING, THAT'S NOT NEW,

17:41.059 --> 17:42.069
VIRUSES ARE ALWAYS MUTATING AND

17:42.089 --> 17:44.019
THAT'S WHY AT FLU SHOTS ARE VERY

17:44.039 --> 17:45.190
OFTEN SO INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE

17:45.210 --> 17:46.180
YOU'RE GETTING THE VACCINE --

17:46.200 --> 17:47.240
THAT'S WHY I NEVER WANTED A

17:47.259 --> 17:50.150
FLU SHOT, FOR THE ONE THAT WAS

17:50.170 --> 17:51.009
AROUND LAST YEAR.

17:51.029 --> 17:54.049
SOMETIMES THERE IS LITTLE AS 10%

17:54.069 --> 17:55.190
EFFECTIVE.

17:55.210 --> 17:57.000
THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY MUTATING,

17:57.019 --> 17:59.009
WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM NOW, THE

17:59.029 --> 17:59.289
SOUTH AFRICAN ONE, THE BRITISH

18:00.009 --> 18:02.140
ONE, THEY'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD

18:02.160 --> 18:03.250
NOW.

18:03.269 --> 18:05.279
I HEARD AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

18:06.000 --> 18:08.250
THAT THEY USUALLY GET MILDER,

18:08.269 --> 18:11.170
VIRUSES AS THEY MUTATE.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.190
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SURVIVE,

18:12.210 --> 18:16.039
THEY DON'T WANT TO KILL

18:16.059 --> 18:17.170
EVERYBODY, THAN THEY HAVE NO

18:17.190 --> 18:17.230
HOSTS.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.089
>> OF VIRUS THAT DID EMERGE FROM

18:20.109 --> 18:23.190
A LAB WOULD PRECISELY NOT DO THE

18:23.210 --> 18:24.200
THING THAT WILD TYPE OF VIRUSES

18:24.220 --> 18:27.009
WOULD DO, IT MIGHT DO WHAT WE

18:27.029 --> 18:29.200
SEEM TO BE SEEING, GET MORE BEER

18:29.220 --> 18:30.180
RELENT AND GET MORE PATHOGENIC.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.029
>> Bill: YOU THINK IT'S

18:31.049 --> 18:34.089
GETTING MORE VIRULENT.

18:34.109 --> 18:37.059
>> THE EXPECTATION AMONGST THOSE

18:37.079 --> 18:38.069
WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY

18:38.089 --> 18:38.240
INVESTIGATED THE QUESTION OF

18:38.259 --> 18:43.180
WHETHER THIS IS A LAB ESCAPE

18:43.200 --> 18:45.130
VIRUS IS THAT THE VIRUS WOULD

18:45.150 --> 18:47.130
HAVE BEEN PASSED THROUGH EITHER

18:47.150 --> 18:48.250
ANIMALS IN THE LAB OR TISSUES IN

18:48.269 --> 18:50.230
THE LAB IN ORDER TO USE

18:50.250 --> 18:55.230
EVOLUTION TO REREAD IT.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.170
THAT MEANS TENSION WAS PUT ON

18:56.190 --> 18:59.190
THE VIRUS PUTTING TO MIKE

18:59.210 --> 19:01.150
PULLING IT IN THE DIRECTION OF

19:01.170 --> 19:03.190
CERTAIN THINGS, CERTAIN THINGS

19:03.210 --> 19:04.059
WERE INTENTIONAL LIKE

19:04.079 --> 19:04.240
INFECTIOUSNESS OF HUMAN CELLS

19:04.259 --> 19:06.089
WHICH MAY GIVE IT EXTRA

19:06.109 --> 19:09.210
CAPACITIES LIKE THIS CLEAVAGE

19:09.230 --> 19:11.000
SITE THAT NO OTHER VIRUS LIKE IT

19:11.019 --> 19:14.170
HAS BUT SARS-COV-2 DOES.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.079
IN ANY CASE, IN AN ATTEMPT TO

19:16.099 --> 19:18.210
GIVE IT EXTRA CAPACITIES, LOTS

19:18.230 --> 19:19.190
OF THINGS WILL HAVE BEEN

19:19.210 --> 19:22.069
INFLICTED ON THE VIRUS,

19:22.089 --> 19:24.190
INCLUDING THINGS WE DON'T THINK

19:24.210 --> 19:25.220
ABOUT.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.099
MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS, THE

19:27.119 --> 19:27.279
FACT THAT THIS VIRUS ATTACK SO

19:28.009 --> 19:29.160
MANY DIFFERENT TISSUES IN THE

19:29.180 --> 19:31.180
BODY DOES NOT SEEM NATURAL.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.279
THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT AT

19:34.000 --> 19:35.250
LEAST AT THE BEGINNING SEEM TO

19:35.269 --> 19:36.140
TRANSMIT OUTDOORS NEARLY AT ALL

19:36.160 --> 19:39.190
IS VERY CONSPICUOUS.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.180
AFTER ALL, MOST ANIMALS LIVE

19:41.200 --> 19:41.259
OUTDOORS.

19:41.279 --> 19:44.200
A VIRUS THAT SEEMS TO BE ADAPTED

19:44.220 --> 19:45.230
TO INDOOR TRANSMISSION IS

19:45.250 --> 19:47.039
CONSPICUOUS IN THIS CASE.

19:47.059 --> 19:48.190
I THINK HEATHER'S POINT IS YOU

19:48.210 --> 19:49.250
TAKE THE TENSION OFF OF IT, YOU

19:49.269 --> 19:51.059
LET IT GO INTO THE HUMAN

19:51.079 --> 19:52.180
POPULATION AND IT SPREADS OUT,

19:52.200 --> 19:55.039
WE'VE NOW GOT MANY MILLIONS OF

19:55.059 --> 19:56.130
INDIVIDUALS WITH INFECTIONS,

19:56.150 --> 19:58.000
IT'S NOW GOING TO MOVE IN THE

19:58.019 --> 19:58.289
DIRECTION THAT MAKES THE MOST

19:59.009 --> 20:00.210
SENSE FOR IT RATHER THAN THE

20:00.230 --> 20:02.240
MOST SENSE FOR THE RESEARCHERS.

20:02.259 --> 20:04.109
I THINK THERE'S EVERY

20:04.130 --> 20:06.130
POSSIBILITY THAT WHAT WE ARE

20:06.150 --> 20:08.130
SEEING IS A RESPONSE TO THIS

20:08.150 --> 20:11.140
VIRUS NOW BEING FREE TO EXPLORE

20:11.160 --> 20:12.170
EVOLUTIONARY SPACE.

20:12.190 --> 20:16.069
>> THE COMMON THEME IS WITH AN

20:16.089 --> 20:16.259
EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE ON THE

20:16.279 --> 20:20.059
RESEARCH THAT IS BEING DONE, IT

20:20.079 --> 20:20.289
SEEMS THERE ARE PERVERSE

20:21.009 --> 20:22.250
INCENTIVES ONCE YOU START DOING

20:22.269 --> 20:24.130
RESEARCH TO TRY TO KEEP DOING

20:24.150 --> 20:25.200
THAT RESEARCH REGARDLESS OF

20:25.220 --> 20:26.250
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S STILL GOOD

20:26.269 --> 20:31.200
FOR HUMANITY, RIGHT?

20:31.220 --> 20:34.279
WHETHER OR NOT THIS VIRUS

20:35.009 --> 20:37.059
EMERGED FROM A LAB OR NOT

20:37.079 --> 20:38.039
ACTUALLY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR

20:38.059 --> 20:39.119
HOW IT IS LIKELY TO BEHAVE NOW

20:39.140 --> 20:42.000
THAT IT'S OUT IN THE WORLD AND

20:42.019 --> 20:43.099
HOW THEREFORE WE SHOULD IMAGINE

20:43.119 --> 20:44.190
HOW LIKELY THESE THINGS ARE

20:44.210 --> 20:46.069
GOING TO BE GOING FORWARD TO.

20:46.089 --> 20:47.200
>> Bill: WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

20:47.220 --> 20:48.079
PAYING ATTENTION TO THE LAB

20:48.099 --> 20:51.200
THEORY AT THE BEGINNING BUT WE

20:51.220 --> 20:52.089
DIDN'T BECAUSE IT'S POLITICIZED

20:52.109 --> 20:53.029
IS THE MORAL THERE.

20:53.049 --> 20:55.140
>> IF WE HAD PAID ATTENTION TO

20:55.160 --> 20:57.180
IT AND RECOGNIZE JUST HOW LIKELY

20:57.200 --> 21:01.089
IT WAS, THEN WE WOULD HAVE

21:01.109 --> 21:01.289
SURELY PUT PRESSURE ON THE

21:02.009 --> 21:03.160
CHINESE TO REVEAL WHAT THEY KNEW

21:03.180 --> 21:05.039
ABOUT THIS.

21:05.059 --> 21:06.069
IF WE HAD HAD THAT INFORMATION,

21:06.089 --> 21:08.000
WE WOULD'VE BEEN IN A MUCH

21:08.019 --> 21:08.250
BETTER POSITION.

21:08.269 --> 21:10.009
WE WOULD'VE KNOWN WHAT TO EXPECT

21:10.029 --> 21:11.130
AND MIGHT OF HAD A BETTER

21:11.150 --> 21:14.240
APPROACH OF VACCINE FRONT.

21:14.259 --> 21:16.009
INSTEAD, WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING A

21:16.029 --> 21:17.150
CLEARLY FALSE NOTION OF ALL THE

21:17.170 --> 21:19.079
THINGS WE WERE ASSURED WERE TRUE

21:19.099 --> 21:22.089
AT THE BEGINNING, THIS WAS A BAT

21:22.109 --> 21:23.130
VIRUS THAT INFECTED A PANGOLIN

21:23.150 --> 21:24.190
AND ESCAPED THROUGH A WET

21:24.210 --> 21:26.069
MARKET, THAT'S ALL KNOWN TO BE

21:26.089 --> 21:26.170
FALSE.

21:26.190 --> 21:31.079
THE ONLY PART OF THAT THAT STOOD

21:31.099 --> 21:32.140
WAS THE MAJOR PART OF IT CAME

21:32.160 --> 21:35.059
FROM A BAT BUT THE REST OF IT

21:35.079 --> 21:35.289
CAME CRASHING DOWN.

21:36.009 --> 21:38.049
>> Bill: I WAS HOPING TO END

21:38.069 --> 21:39.109
ON A HAPPIER NOTE, I THANK YOU

21:39.130 --> 21:41.230
FOR THE NUANCE IN THE

21:41.250 --> 21:43.009
CONVERSATION.

21:43.029 --> 21:43.279
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, TIME TO

21:44.000 --> 21:49.279
MEET OUR PANEL.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.099
OKAY.

21:52.119 --> 21:56.109
[APPLAUSE]

21:56.130 --> 21:57.140
I'M SORRY THAT WAS A BUMMER,

21:57.160 --> 21:59.279
WE'VE GOT TO TALK TRUE -- HE IS

22:00.000 --> 22:01.240
A CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND

22:01.259 --> 22:05.019
A CEO OF REFORM ALLIANCE, OUR

22:05.039 --> 22:08.099
FRIEND BEN JONES.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.099
HE'S A JOURNALIST AND

22:09.119 --> 22:11.059
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR AT HARPER'S

22:11.079 --> 22:11.269
MAGAZINE, JAMES POLK, GREAT TO

22:11.289 --> 22:15.240
HAVE YOU HERE.

22:15.259 --> 22:18.259
LET'S MOVE TO A SOMEWHAT RELATED

22:18.279 --> 22:22.089
TOPIC, THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE

22:22.109 --> 22:22.250
BIDEN IS SIGNING EXECUTIVE

22:22.269 --> 22:26.039
ORDERS ON THAT --

22:26.059 --> 22:27.089
>> THANK GOD.

22:27.109 --> 22:28.000
>> Bill: PUTTING IT ON THE

22:28.019 --> 22:34.029
FRONT BURNER, THIS WAS YOUR

22:34.049 --> 22:34.109
PORTFOLIO.

22:34.130 --> 22:37.170
THE WORLD KNOWS ABOUT VAN JONES

22:37.190 --> 22:39.180
BECAUSE YOU WERE THE GREENS ARE

22:39.200 --> 22:39.279
AND GOT FIRED.

22:40.000 --> 22:40.279
BEFORE WE GET TO THE

22:41.000 --> 22:42.170
ENVIRONMENT, I HAVE TO SAY THIS

22:42.190 --> 22:44.130
BECAUSE THIS BOTHERED ME ALL

22:44.150 --> 22:45.220
WEEK, THINKING ABOUT YOU BEING

22:45.240 --> 22:46.250
ON THE SHOW -- I DON'T REMEMBER

22:46.269 --> 22:49.190
WHAT IT WAS BUT I KNOW IT WAS

22:49.210 --> 22:50.259
NOTHING.

22:50.279 --> 22:53.019
WATCHING THIS NOT MARJORIE

22:53.039 --> 22:57.190
TAYLOR GREENE WHO WAS PLAINLY

22:57.210 --> 22:58.119
TALKING ABOUT KILLING HER

22:58.140 --> 23:00.079
COWORKERS IN THE BREAK ROOM KIND

23:00.099 --> 23:01.210
OF STUFF, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU

23:01.230 --> 23:05.230
BUT THEY DON'T FIRE HER, WHO WAS

23:05.250 --> 23:08.059
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DOUBLE

23:08.079 --> 23:08.140
STANDARD?

23:08.160 --> 23:10.029
OF WHAT YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH?

23:10.049 --> 23:14.069
AL FRANKEN HAS TO GO -- THE

23:14.089 --> 23:15.089
THINGS DEMOCRATS HAVE APOLOGIZED

23:15.109 --> 23:16.289
FOR, THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE THINGS

23:17.009 --> 23:18.279
AND THEY GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.230
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING

23:20.250 --> 23:20.289
THIS?

23:21.009 --> 23:22.160
>> I THINK THE REPUBLICANS HAVE

23:22.180 --> 23:24.009
PROFITED FROM THE SAME KIND OF

23:24.029 --> 23:25.200
STUFF THAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

23:25.220 --> 23:28.079
IF YOU LOOK AT REPUBLICAN RETAIL

23:28.099 --> 23:29.059
POLITICS, YOU GO TO REPUBLICAN

23:29.079 --> 23:32.190
RALLIES AND TOWN HALLS, THE

23:32.210 --> 23:34.250
STUFF SHE'S SAYING IS NOT THAT

23:34.269 --> 23:35.109
CRAZY.

23:35.130 --> 23:37.269
>> Bill: TO THEM.

23:37.289 --> 23:39.130
>> TO THEM.

23:39.150 --> 23:41.170
>> Bill: MAKE SURE WE

23:41.190 --> 23:44.240
UNDERSTAND THAT, VERY IMPORTANT.

23:44.259 --> 23:48.009
ESTABLISH THE GUEST IS NOT A

23:48.029 --> 23:50.160
NOT.

23:50.180 --> 23:53.180
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY

23:53.200 --> 23:54.039
REPUBLICAN RETAIL POLITICS

23:54.059 --> 23:55.130
WORKS, THIS KIND OF STUFF IS

23:55.150 --> 23:57.130
FEELING THE ENERGY, IT'S WHAT

23:57.150 --> 23:58.240
GETS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE

23:58.259 --> 24:00.259
COUNTRY ELECTED AND YOU GET INTO

24:00.279 --> 24:02.059
CONGRESS AND THEY REFUSED TO

24:02.079 --> 24:04.259
WORK TOGETHER, THEY REFUSED TO

24:04.279 --> 24:05.210
COUNTENANCE THE IDEA THAT A LOT

24:05.230 --> 24:08.259
OF DEMOCRATS ARE NOT SOCIALIST

24:08.279 --> 24:10.079
TREASONOUS CRAZY PEOPLE AND YOU

24:10.099 --> 24:10.259
GET REPUBLICAN CONSTITUENCIES

24:10.279 --> 24:12.170
THAT ARE FED TO THE IDEA THAT WE

24:12.190 --> 24:13.109
DON'T WORK TOGETHER, EVERYBODY

24:13.130 --> 24:14.160
ON THE OTHER SIDE IS EVIL AND

24:14.180 --> 24:15.180
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE STUFF

24:15.200 --> 24:19.119
ESTHER UP, IT SEEMS LOGICAL.

24:19.140 --> 24:19.279
>> Bill: IT'S A DIFFERENT

24:20.000 --> 24:22.059
KETTLE OF FISH, TO TALK ABOUT IT

24:22.079 --> 24:26.210
IN THE ABSTRACT VERSUS HAVING

24:26.230 --> 24:28.049
ACTUALLY THREATENED -- THIS WAS

24:28.069 --> 24:32.029
ONLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT SHE

24:32.049 --> 24:32.259
WAS THREATENING NANCY PELOSI.

24:32.279 --> 24:35.130
KATHY GRIFFIN JUST DID A OF

24:35.150 --> 24:37.119
TRUMP'S HEAD AND SHE'S GONE.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.109
IF IT WAS A PHOTO SHOOT, A JOKE,

24:39.130 --> 24:41.069
IT WAS TRUMP'S HEAD, IT WASN'T

24:41.089 --> 24:46.099
HIS REAL HEAD, OF COURSE.

24:46.119 --> 24:48.009
>> IT WAS REMARKABLE, I WAS

24:48.029 --> 24:49.180
CAUGHT ON TAPE SEEING

24:49.200 --> 24:54.130
REPUBLICANS WERE BEING ASSHOLES

24:54.150 --> 24:55.049
ASSHOLES -- DAWN!

24:55.069 --> 24:56.279
>> Bill: IS THAT WHAT IT WAS?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.099
>> THERE WAS THAT AND THE FALSE

24:59.119 --> 25:01.150
THING AROUND THE 9/11 TRUTH

25:01.170 --> 25:03.000
PETITION, STUFF LIKE THAT.

25:03.019 --> 25:03.200
AT DAWN.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.250
NOW YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SAYING

25:05.269 --> 25:07.220
THERE ARE JEWISH SPACE LASERS

25:07.240 --> 25:09.039
STARTING FIRES IN CALIFORNIA.

25:09.059 --> 25:13.019
>> Bill: WAIT, WAIT.

25:13.039 --> 25:14.200
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.

25:14.220 --> 25:16.000
>> EVEN YOU WERE SHOCKED!

25:16.019 --> 25:17.230
>> Bill: WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

25:17.250 --> 25:17.289
ABOUT?

25:18.009 --> 25:20.230
>> THAT'S THE MOST RECENT THING

25:20.250 --> 25:22.160
THAT SHE HAS BEEN CAUGHT SAYING.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.019
>> Bill: WHAT IS A JEWISH

25:24.039 --> 25:25.009
SPACE LASER?

25:25.029 --> 25:29.150
>> YOU KNOW.

25:29.170 --> 25:30.059
A JEWISH SPACE LASER.

25:30.079 --> 25:31.279
>> Bill: I KNOW SHE'S AN

25:32.000 --> 25:33.059
ANTI-SEMITE, SHE THINKS THIS IS

25:33.079 --> 25:40.289
A PLOT BY TO START FIRES?

25:41.009 --> 25:46.230
>> EVEN BILL MAR!

25:46.250 --> 25:49.210
>> Bill: I THINK ALIENS PROBED

25:49.230 --> 25:56.170
HER ASS AND HER BRAINS FELL OUT.

25:56.190 --> 25:58.220
>> WHAT I WILL SAY IS ARTICLE

25:58.240 --> 26:03.089
ONE, SECTION FIVE, CONGRESS

26:03.109 --> 26:04.099
SHOULD THROW HER OUT TO.

26:04.119 --> 26:05.089
>> Bill: SHOULD COME OUT WE

26:05.109 --> 26:08.099
WILL HAVE A HELL OF A PARTY.

26:08.119 --> 26:09.099
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

26:09.119 --> 26:11.069
>> THE CHANCE WE HAVE NOW IS HOW

26:11.089 --> 26:12.240
MUCH ATTENTION TO YOU GIVE

26:12.259 --> 26:14.000
SOMEBODY LIKE HER?

26:14.019 --> 26:15.019
WE PROBABLY GIVEN HER MORE

26:15.039 --> 26:16.089
ATTENTION THAN SOME OF THE STUFF

26:16.109 --> 26:17.180
BIDEN HAS DONE.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.069
WE DID THAT WITH TRUMP.

26:19.089 --> 26:20.230
WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE NEED TO

26:20.250 --> 26:22.190
MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS

26:22.210 --> 26:24.079
THE DIRECTION SOME PEOPLE IN THE

26:24.099 --> 26:25.210
REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S

26:25.230 --> 26:27.220
DESPICABLE AND TERRIBLE, THEY

26:27.240 --> 26:30.109
CAN CENSURE HER ONLY WITH

26:30.130 --> 26:31.019
MAJORITY, CONGRESS SHOULD ACT IN

26:31.039 --> 26:34.089
THE MEDIA SHOULD MOVE ON.

26:34.109 --> 26:40.089
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE AN ACT OUT

26:40.109 --> 26:41.059
OF THIS CRAZY PERSON.

26:41.079 --> 26:42.109
>> Bill: EVEN HE JUST SAID

26:42.130 --> 26:45.019
LOCK HER UP, HE DIDN'T SAY HANG

26:45.039 --> 26:47.170
HER.

26:47.190 --> 26:50.059
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A BRIDGE TOO

26:50.079 --> 26:51.190
FAR.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.009
>> I HAVE A KIND OF HOT TAKE ON

26:54.029 --> 26:55.190
THIS, I THINK A LOT OF THIS

26:55.210 --> 26:58.049
STUFF IS FOCUSED ON WHAT SHE

26:58.069 --> 26:59.049
LIKED ON FACEBOOK AND I DO

26:59.069 --> 27:01.160
THINK -- IF WE ARE GOING TO BE

27:01.180 --> 27:03.279
PRINCIPLED PEOPLE, I'M A

27:04.000 --> 27:04.190
LEFTIST, I'VE LIKED A LOT OF

27:04.210 --> 27:06.250
STUFF ABOUT REVOLUTION, DOES

27:06.269 --> 27:09.279
THAT MEAN THAT I ENDORSED

27:10.000 --> 27:11.269
SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY IF I RAN

27:11.289 --> 27:15.180
FOR OFFICE?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.119
>> Bill: IT'S STILL DIFFERENT.

27:16.140 --> 27:21.240
>> TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

27:21.259 --> 27:23.250
>> Bill: IN FEBRUARY 2019,

27:23.269 --> 27:24.210
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE LED A

27:24.230 --> 27:25.150
GROUP OF TRUMP SUPPORTER'S INTO

27:25.170 --> 27:29.109
THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE, I NEED TO

27:29.130 --> 27:32.259
FIND OUT HOW THAT HAPPENED.

27:32.279 --> 27:34.240
SOMETHING WITH FACEBOOK,

27:34.259 --> 27:36.289
FACEBOOK CAN GET ANYWHERE WHERE

27:37.009 --> 27:38.250
SHE ACCUSED PELOSI OF TREASON

27:38.269 --> 27:44.150
AND SHE SHALL SUFFER DEATH.

27:44.170 --> 27:46.240
A FACEBOOK COMMENTATOR, THE YEAR

27:46.259 --> 27:49.099
BEFORE COMMENTED NOW DO WE HANG

27:49.119 --> 27:50.190
THEM REFERRING TO OBAMA AND

27:50.210 --> 27:52.039
HILLARY AND SHE WROTE BACK AT

27:52.059 --> 27:53.230
THE STAGE IS BEING SET, PLAYERS

27:53.250 --> 27:56.019
ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE, WE MUST

27:56.039 --> 27:58.200
BE PATIENT.

27:58.220 --> 28:04.170
IT'S A DIFFERENT LEVEL.

28:04.190 --> 28:06.289
THIS CANNOT STAND, YOU CAN'T

28:07.009 --> 28:08.240
HAVE SOMEONE -- IT WAS A JOKE

28:08.259 --> 28:10.160
BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN THEY

28:10.180 --> 28:11.160
ARE IN THE ELEVATOR?

28:11.180 --> 28:12.289
>> MY QUESTION ABOUT THIS AND

28:13.009 --> 28:14.180
I'VE SORT OF COME AROUND AS I'VE

28:14.200 --> 28:15.240
MENTIONED, I'VE SORT OF COME

28:15.259 --> 28:17.000
AROUND TO THINKING I THINK

28:17.019 --> 28:19.250
CENSURE IS A GOOD IDEA FOR HER,

28:19.269 --> 28:21.109
SOMETHING SO REPUBLICANS CAN SAY

28:21.130 --> 28:23.250
LOOK, WE ACTUALLY DON'T THINK

28:23.269 --> 28:25.119
THESE PEOPLE ARE TRULY EVIL

28:25.140 --> 28:26.279
CRAZY LIZARD THE SCORPIONS BUT

28:27.000 --> 28:31.009
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT'S CRAZY

28:31.029 --> 28:33.099
IS IT YOU CENSOR HER AND THROW

28:33.119 --> 28:34.289
HER OUT, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU END

28:35.009 --> 28:36.180
UP IN A SITUATION WHERE SHE

28:36.200 --> 28:38.009
BECOMES THE MARTYR.

28:38.029 --> 28:39.089
IT'S ALMOST UNSCALABLE VIRUS.

28:39.109 --> 28:40.240
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR

28:40.259 --> 28:44.210
IT BUT I WONDER SOMETIMES --

28:44.230 --> 28:48.119
>> Bill: BUT THAT CAN'T BE --

28:48.140 --> 28:51.170
YOU COULDN'T DO IT ON THE

28:51.190 --> 28:51.240
STREET.

28:51.259 --> 28:55.150
YOU CAN'T THREATEN PEOPLE LIKE

28:55.170 --> 28:55.210
THAT.

28:55.230 --> 28:58.190
CERTAINLY NOT ELECTED OFFICIALS.

28:58.210 --> 29:01.230
>> WORDS DO HAVE CONSEQUENCE,

29:01.250 --> 29:02.109
DON'T FORGET GABBY GIFFORD,

29:02.130 --> 29:05.279
DON'T FORGET STEVE SCALISE.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.240
>> Bill: DON'T FORGET

29:07.259 --> 29:08.069
JANUARY 6TH.

29:08.089 --> 29:10.059
>> THE INSURRECTION -- I

29:10.079 --> 29:11.099
ACTUALLY MISS THE TEA PARTY.

29:11.119 --> 29:13.230
RUB THE TEA PARTY?

29:13.250 --> 29:16.150
THEY WERE JUST SORT OF MEAN AND

29:16.170 --> 29:19.269
GRUMPY, THEY WEREN'T MURDEROUS

29:19.289 --> 29:20.069
TRADERS.

29:20.089 --> 29:22.119
>> I THINK IF YOU WERE AT TEA

29:22.140 --> 29:23.049
PARTY RALLIES YOU HEARD

29:23.069 --> 29:24.240
MURDEROUS TRADERS ALL THE TIME,

29:24.259 --> 29:28.150
THAT'S WHERE THIS STARTED.

29:28.170 --> 29:29.230
FRANKLY REPUBLICANS ENCOURAGED

29:29.250 --> 29:30.230
THAT AT THAT TIME, THIS IS WHERE

29:30.250 --> 29:33.220
THIS ALL BEGAN.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.079
>> I THINK A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

29:35.099 --> 29:36.190
TO GO TO A TEA PARTY RALLY WHEN

29:36.210 --> 29:40.019
THEY SAY STUFF AND WHAT WE SAW

29:40.039 --> 29:41.180
ON JANUARY 6TH.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.119
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE MUTATING

29:43.140 --> 29:44.230
IN A WORSE DIRECTION.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.079
IF >> Bill: THAT'S THE SHAME

29:46.099 --> 29:47.039
OF THE SHOW TONIGHT.

29:47.059 --> 29:48.230
>> THINGS MUTATING IN THE WORST

29:48.250 --> 29:50.160
DIRECTION, THE ONLY GOOD THING

29:50.180 --> 29:51.089
THAT'S HAPPENING IS JOE BIDEN

29:51.109 --> 29:54.200
WHY WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.289
HE IS THE VACCINE.

29:57.009 --> 30:00.279
>> Bill: WOW, LET'S NOT PUT

30:01.000 --> 30:01.230
SUPERMAN'S CAPE ON HIM YET, WE

30:01.250 --> 30:04.109
ARE ALL GLAD HE'S IN.

30:04.130 --> 30:06.150
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

30:06.170 --> 30:07.160
ENVIRONMENT, YOUR OLD PORTFOLIO,

30:07.180 --> 30:09.150
THE GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT

30:09.170 --> 30:10.289
PRIORITIES.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.289
THAT'S WHAT ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT,

30:14.009 --> 30:14.259
IT'S GREAT THAT HE'S SIGNING

30:14.279 --> 30:17.079
EXECUTIVE ORDERS BUT EXECUTIVE

30:17.099 --> 30:18.279
ORDERS FEEL GREAT THE FIRST

30:19.000 --> 30:19.279
WEEK.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.160
AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE TO

30:21.180 --> 30:24.190
LEGISLATE TO GET ANYTHING REAL

30:24.210 --> 30:27.109
DONE.

30:27.130 --> 30:30.029
HOW DO YOU GET THE TRUMP VOTER

30:30.049 --> 30:31.099
TO FEEL THE ENVIRONMENT IS A

30:31.119 --> 30:31.220
PRIORITY.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.150
I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S

30:33.170 --> 30:34.200
A PRIORITY, THEY WERE THERE

30:34.220 --> 30:37.140
BEFORE TRUMP, THEY ARE THERE NO

30:37.160 --> 30:39.029
NOW.

30:39.049 --> 30:40.259
WE HAD THIS UNDOING, TRUMP COMES

30:40.279 --> 30:42.160
IN AND UNDOES EVERYTHING OBAMA

30:42.180 --> 30:45.039
DOES, BIDEN UNDOES EVERYTHING

30:45.059 --> 30:46.230
TRUMP DOES, IT'S LATERAL

30:46.250 --> 30:49.049
MOVEMENT, IT'S GOOD FOR

30:49.069 --> 30:49.150
CONSERVATIVES.

30:49.170 --> 30:50.089
THE COUNTRY DOESN'T MOVE

30:50.109 --> 30:50.160
FORWARD.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.109
WE HAVE TO GET THE OTHER HALF OF

30:51.130 --> 30:55.279
AMERICA TO BELIEVE THAT CLIMATE

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
CHANGE -- HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

30:58.019 --> 30:59.289
>> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I ACTUALLY

31:00.009 --> 31:03.170
HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU,

31:03.190 --> 31:04.250
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED COMMON

31:04.269 --> 31:07.069
GROUND ON CLIMATE, BIPARTISAN --

31:07.089 --> 31:11.250
CHRIS COONS AND MIKE BROWN,

31:11.269 --> 31:12.230
HARD-CORE LIBERAL, HARD-CORE

31:12.250 --> 31:13.200
CONSERVATIVE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING

31:13.220 --> 31:15.069
TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

31:15.089 --> 31:16.059
THEY HAD 14 SENATORS BUT HERE'S

31:16.079 --> 31:18.119
THE CRAZY THING IS HAPPENING.

31:18.140 --> 31:20.049
ON THE RIGHT YOU'VE GOT RED

31:20.069 --> 31:23.130
STATE FARMERS, RANCHERS, PEOPLE

31:23.150 --> 31:24.180
INVOLVED IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY

31:24.200 --> 31:26.180
WHO ARE LOSING THEIR EVERYTHING

31:26.200 --> 31:29.049
BECAUSE OF FLOODS, FIRES, RISING

31:29.069 --> 31:29.240
TEMPERATURES SO YOU'RE STARTING

31:29.259 --> 31:33.099
TO HAVE A CONSTITUENCY IN THE

31:33.119 --> 31:33.279
REPUBLICAN PARTY SAYING EXCUSE

31:34.000 --> 31:34.279
ME, NOW YOU HAVE THESE YOUNG

31:35.000 --> 31:37.269
LIBERTARIAN CONSERVATIVES WHO

31:37.289 --> 31:40.029
SAY WE DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE

31:40.049 --> 31:41.150
IN AOC'S ECONOMIC POLICY BUT WE

31:41.170 --> 31:42.099
BELIEVE IN CLIMATE SCIENCE.

31:42.119 --> 31:44.049
IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

31:44.069 --> 31:46.250
GET SOMETHING DONE EVEN ON

31:46.269 --> 31:47.109
CLIMATE.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.099
IT'S SO BAD NOW EVEN A

31:49.119 --> 31:49.269
GRASS-ROOTS CONSERVATIVE IS

31:49.289 --> 31:50.160
SAYING SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE,

31:50.180 --> 31:54.079
THAT'S A POSITIVE.

31:54.099 --> 31:59.160
>> I THINK THAT ONE OF THE

31:59.180 --> 32:03.119
THINGS TOM VILSACK HAS BEEN

32:03.140 --> 32:03.220
TALKING ABOUT.

32:03.240 --> 32:08.099
>> Bill: HE'S THE ACTING

32:08.119 --> 32:09.059
SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE?

32:09.079 --> 32:15.170
SPEAK TO REGULAR PEOPLE.

32:15.190 --> 32:20.009
SENATE BILL H1 -- SPEAK TO

32:20.029 --> 32:20.109
NORMAL PEOPLE.

32:20.130 --> 32:22.000
>> WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED A LOT

32:22.019 --> 32:23.109
OF LIBERALS WERE ANGRY AND PART

32:23.130 --> 32:25.130
OF THAT HAD TO DO WAS THE FACT

32:25.150 --> 32:26.240
THAT A BIG TENT OF THE PUSH FOR

32:26.259 --> 32:28.279
THE AGREED NEW DEAL WAS TO TRY

32:29.000 --> 32:30.240
TO BRING RURAL PEOPLE ALONG, TRY

32:30.259 --> 32:32.230
TO GET THESE HARD-CORE TRUMP

32:32.250 --> 32:34.109
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

32:34.130 --> 32:35.099
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY CAN HELP

32:35.119 --> 32:37.000
REPAIR WIND AND WATER AND

32:37.019 --> 32:39.049
REBUILD THE FAMILY FARM ECONOMY

32:39.069 --> 32:40.049
AND THINGS LIKE THIS.

32:40.069 --> 32:41.170
>> Bill: ARE THEY

32:41.190 --> 32:42.200
CONNECTING -- I UNDERSTAND THAT

32:42.220 --> 32:44.029
YOU'RE SAYING THEY ARE SEEING

32:44.049 --> 32:45.019
THESE DELETERIOUS THINGS HAPPEN

32:45.039 --> 32:47.170
IN THEIR OWN LIFE.

32:47.190 --> 32:48.059
ARE THEY CONNECTING IT TO THE

32:48.079 --> 32:53.269
RIGHT THING IS SUPPOSED TO

32:53.289 --> 32:56.119
JEWISH LASERS?

32:56.140 --> 32:56.279
[LAUGHTER]

32:57.000 --> 32:59.069
[APPLAUSE]

32:59.089 --> 33:01.059
IF THEY THINK I DON'T HAVE AS

33:01.079 --> 33:02.059
MUCH WATER AS I USE TO END MY

33:02.079 --> 33:06.069
CATTLE ARE DIANE, IT'S BECAUSE

33:06.089 --> 33:06.259
HILLARY IS EATING BABIES, ARE WE

33:06.279 --> 33:09.109
MAKING THIS CONNECTION?

33:09.130 --> 33:11.170
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE OFTEN

33:11.190 --> 33:13.089
GIVE THE ATTENTION TO THE JEWISH

33:13.109 --> 33:16.230
LASER CROWD, WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

33:16.250 --> 33:17.230
THE AMERICAN CONSERVATION

33:17.250 --> 33:18.029
COALITION.

33:18.049 --> 33:18.289
>> Bill: THERE ARE PLENTY OF

33:19.009 --> 33:20.130
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE NOT KEY WHAT

33:20.150 --> 33:21.119
NON.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.259
>> THESE GROUPS TO HAVE A SHOT

33:22.279 --> 33:23.210
UNDER BIDEN BECAUSE WE COULD PUT

33:23.230 --> 33:25.230
FOR SOMEBODY THAT WILL GET THEIR

33:25.250 --> 33:26.190
ATTENTION BECAUSE JOBS ALSO CAN

33:26.210 --> 33:29.250
COME OUT OF THIS THING.

33:29.269 --> 33:31.099
>> I THINK THE FLIP SIDE HERE IS

33:31.119 --> 33:32.220
THAT MAYBE YOU CAN'T BRING THEM

33:32.240 --> 33:33.269
ALONG AND IF THE QUESTION IS DO

33:33.289 --> 33:36.109
WE SAVE THE PLANET AND IF WE

33:36.130 --> 33:38.019
HAVE TO SAVE THE PLANET, DO WE

33:38.039 --> 33:39.140
TRY TO STEAMROLL PEOPLE, YOU'RE

33:39.160 --> 33:42.170
GOING TO HAVE TO END UP TRYING

33:42.190 --> 33:43.160
TO STEAMROLL PEOPLE.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.049
>> Bill: STEAMROLLED BY --

33:44.069 --> 33:49.230
>> JOE MANCHIN IS SOMEBODY --

33:49.250 --> 33:50.279
>> Bill: HE'S A DEMOCRAT

33:51.000 --> 33:52.059
SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA.

33:52.079 --> 33:54.109
HE VERY OFTEN VOTES FROM THE

33:54.130 --> 33:56.180
REPUBLICANS BECAUSE HE'S FROM

33:56.200 --> 33:57.059
THE MOST REPUBLICAN STATES.

33:57.079 --> 33:58.200
HE'S A DEMOCRAT BUT YOU CAN'T

33:58.220 --> 34:00.069
COUNT ON THEM AS A DEMOCRAT.

34:00.089 --> 34:03.049
>> YOU CAN LEARN A LOT.

34:03.069 --> 34:04.180
>> Bill: YOU HAVE TO REALLY

34:04.200 --> 34:05.039
PANDER TO HIM.

34:05.059 --> 34:07.230
>> HE SHOT WITH A HUNTING RIFLE

34:07.250 --> 34:08.260
WITH A CAMPAIGN AD THE 2010

34:08.280 --> 34:11.000
CLIMATE BILL.

34:11.019 --> 34:12.130
AT SOME POINT PEOPLE LIKE THAT

34:12.150 --> 34:13.119
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET

34:13.139 --> 34:14.230
PRESSURED WHETHER IT'S FROM THE

34:14.250 --> 34:16.039
WHITE HOUSE OR FROM THE STREETS,

34:16.059 --> 34:17.250
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

34:17.269 --> 34:19.110
USE UNCONVENTIONAL MEANS IF WE

34:19.130 --> 34:21.050
ONLY HAVE -- AS THEY SAY, WE

34:21.070 --> 34:22.170
HAVE TEN YEARS, WE ARE ALREADY

34:22.190 --> 34:24.190
BEHIND THAT SCHEDULE.

34:24.210 --> 34:27.219
>> Bill: THEY SAID THAT IN

34:27.239 --> 34:28.250
2003.

34:28.269 --> 34:31.030
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE PESSIMIST

34:31.050 --> 34:32.050
HERE BUT YES, WE PASS THAT ALONG

34:32.070 --> 34:34.030
TIME TIME AGO.

34:34.050 --> 34:36.260
BUT WE HAVE TO TRY AND WE ALSO

34:36.280 --> 34:38.070
SAW THE BEGINNING OF THE

34:38.090 --> 34:40.190
PANDEMIC WHEN WE ALL STAYED AND

34:40.210 --> 34:41.150
HID UNDER THE BED, THE

34:41.170 --> 34:45.190
ENVIRONMENT GOT BETTER LIKE IN A

34:45.210 --> 34:45.260
WEEK.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.059
YOU SAW BUTTERFLIES.

34:48.079 --> 34:50.010
NATURE WAS LIKE JUST GIVE US A

34:50.030 --> 34:50.179
WEEK.

34:50.199 --> 34:53.139
>> IT WAS AMAZING, I LIVE IN

34:53.159 --> 34:55.019
LOS ANGELES, THERE WERE

34:55.039 --> 34:55.280
LITERALLY COYOTES AND SKUNKS

34:56.000 --> 34:57.130
WALKING DOWN THE STREETS, THE

34:57.150 --> 34:59.269
WITCH IS DEAD, THE HUMANS ARE

34:59.289 --> 35:00.059
GONE.

35:00.079 --> 35:02.179
>> Bill: RIGHT!

35:02.199 --> 35:05.059
>> IT CAN COME BACK, IT CAN HEAL

35:05.079 --> 35:06.179
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME

35:06.199 --> 35:07.000
BREAKTHROUGH THIS.

35:07.019 --> 35:09.070
>> WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A

35:09.090 --> 35:10.159
CONVERSATION AT SOME POINT ABOUT

35:10.179 --> 35:13.110
WHETHER A SOCIETY THAT IS

35:13.130 --> 35:14.110
ORIENTED AROUND INFINITE

35:14.130 --> 35:15.130
ECONOMIC GROWTH, INFINITELY

35:15.150 --> 35:16.070
SPIRALING USE OF RESOURCES AND

35:16.090 --> 35:17.130
ENERGY IS GOING TO EVER BE ABLE

35:17.150 --> 35:19.179
TO GET TO A POINT OF BEING

35:19.199 --> 35:20.260
SUSTAINABLE, SO SOMETHING WE CAN

35:20.280 --> 35:22.050
HOPE TO HAVE JOSEPH ARBEIT AND

35:22.070 --> 35:23.170
FIXED NOW BUT IT IS GOING TO

35:23.190 --> 35:25.139
HAVE TO BE THE CONVERSATION DOWN

35:25.159 --> 35:25.289
THE ROAD.

35:26.010 --> 35:26.190
>> Bill: DO YOU THINK WE ARE

35:26.210 --> 35:28.099
GOING TO GET TO A TIPPING POINT

35:28.119 --> 35:33.039
LIKE WE DID WITH GAY MARRIAGE OR

35:33.059 --> 35:34.269
POT WHERE IT SEEM LIKE PEOPLE

35:34.289 --> 35:36.199
WERE NOT BUDGING AND THEY GOT

35:36.219 --> 35:38.230
THE MESSAGE.

35:38.250 --> 35:42.280
OKAY, GAY PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE

35:43.000 --> 35:44.099
TO HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS, MARIJUANA

35:44.119 --> 35:45.289
IS NOT THE DEVIL'S WEED,

35:46.010 --> 35:49.110
CERTAINLY NOT IN MY BATHTUB.

35:49.130 --> 35:49.280
[LAUGHTER]

35:50.000 --> 35:53.150
THEY CHANGED.

35:53.170 --> 35:54.119
THIS IS MORE ABSTRACT.

35:54.139 --> 35:58.090
>> THE WAY YOU GET THERE IS

35:58.110 --> 36:01.030
AMERICA'S MILITARY, EVERY SINGLE

36:01.050 --> 36:04.219
SCENARIO AT THE PENTAGON HAS

36:04.239 --> 36:06.150
CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE CHAOS AS A

36:06.170 --> 36:07.179
THREAT TO U.S. INTERESTS.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.190
IF YOU HAVE THE FARMERS AND THE

36:09.210 --> 36:12.230
RANCHERS AND THE GENERALS, NOT

36:12.250 --> 36:13.119
VAN JONES AND AL GORE, THE

36:13.139 --> 36:14.250
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE HEARD

36:14.269 --> 36:17.280
TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO SPEAK.

36:18.000 --> 36:18.289
>> Bill: THEY ARE COMING OUT

36:19.010 --> 36:22.289
WITH AN ELECTRIC HUMMER TRUCK

36:23.010 --> 36:29.059
THAT HAS 11,000 POUNDS OF

36:29.079 --> 36:30.070
TORQUE.

36:30.090 --> 36:33.280
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS

36:34.000 --> 36:38.030
BUT I KNOW IT GAVE PEOPLE IN THE

36:38.050 --> 36:39.170
MIDWEST AN ERECTION.

36:39.190 --> 36:42.110
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED, HUMMER

36:42.130 --> 36:42.190
ELECTRIC.

36:42.210 --> 36:44.090
>> ABSOLUTELY, LET'S MAKE IT AND

36:44.110 --> 36:46.170
EVERYBODY ISSUE INSTEAD OF

36:46.190 --> 36:46.289
AVAILABLE ISSUE.

36:47.010 --> 36:48.289
>> Bill: SO THE BIDENS DOGS --

36:49.010 --> 36:51.150
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE INTO A

36:51.170 --> 36:53.219
FEEL-GOOD ISSUE CHAMP AND MAJOR

36:53.239 --> 36:55.289
ARE THEIR NAMES, THEY MOVED INTO

36:56.010 --> 36:57.190
THE WHITE HOUSE ON SUNDAY,

36:57.210 --> 37:01.159
BEATING MILANI UP BY SIX MONTHS.

37:01.179 --> 37:04.239
THE DOGS ARE THERE ALREADY, ONE

37:04.260 --> 37:06.030
OF THEM IS THE FIRST RESCUE AND

37:06.050 --> 37:08.079
THIS IS A NEW DAY IN AMERICA

37:08.099 --> 37:08.280
WITH JOE BIDEN, HE WAS THE

37:09.000 --> 37:11.119
MODERATE IN THE RACE, HE'S

37:11.139 --> 37:14.280
ALWAYS TRYING TO HEAL WITH THE

37:15.000 --> 37:15.210
PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE PARTY SO

37:15.230 --> 37:18.050
HE HAS TWO OF THE MOST

37:18.070 --> 37:19.150
PROGRESSIVE -- LOOK AT ME TRY TO

37:19.170 --> 37:22.159
SELL THIS FOR REAL.

37:22.179 --> 37:24.190
MOST PROGRESSIVE DOGS IN THE

37:24.210 --> 37:25.039
NATION.

37:25.059 --> 37:26.190
THESE DOGS CHAMP AND MAJOR ARE

37:26.210 --> 37:27.070
REALLY PROGRESSIVE.

37:27.090 --> 37:31.050
FOR EXAMPLE, THEIR PRONOUNS ARE

37:31.070 --> 37:32.119
HE, HIM, AND GOOD BOY -- THESE

37:32.139 --> 37:35.050
ARE VERY PROGRESSIVE.

37:35.070 --> 37:36.179
CHAMP IS A GERMAN SHEPHERD BUT

37:36.199 --> 37:39.019
HE IDENTIFIES AS A DOBERMAN.

37:39.039 --> 37:39.099
[LAUGHTER]

37:39.119 --> 37:43.110
[APPLAUSE]

37:43.130 --> 37:47.190
THEY ONLY CHASE ELECTRIC CARS.

37:47.210 --> 37:52.219
WHEN THEY SNIFF ANOTHER DOGS

37:52.239 --> 37:54.239
BUTT, THEY DON'T JUDGE AND MAJOR

37:54.260 --> 37:57.030
ONLY SMELLS ASSES THAT ARE

37:57.050 --> 38:00.179
GLUTEN-FREE.

38:00.199 --> 38:01.019
THEY REFER TO CATS AS

38:01.039 --> 38:03.099
DEPLORABLE'S.

38:03.119 --> 38:03.289
[LAUGHTER]

38:04.010 --> 38:04.079
[APPLAUSE]

38:04.099 --> 38:07.110
BEFORE CHAMP PUMPS YOUR LEG, HE

38:07.130 --> 38:12.210
ASKS FOR CONSENT.

38:12.230 --> 38:15.030
MAJOR WANTS TO DEFUND THE

38:15.050 --> 38:15.179
MAILMAN.

38:15.199 --> 38:17.150
BECAUSE HE'S A DOG.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.050
AND THEY FEEL REALLY GUILTY

38:18.070 --> 38:27.139
ABOUT WEARING FUR.

38:27.159 --> 38:30.190
[APPLAUSE]

38:30.210 --> 38:31.219
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD GO OVER A

38:31.239 --> 38:33.269
LITTLE BETTER WITH THE PEOPLE

38:33.289 --> 38:35.050
WHO RODE IT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND

38:35.070 --> 38:37.280
THIS PHENOMENON BUT OKAY.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.110
SOMETHING ELSE BIDEN DID THIS

38:39.130 --> 38:43.139
WEEK, NOT GOING TO RENEW THE

38:43.159 --> 38:46.260
CONTRACTS FOR FOR-PROFIT PRISON

38:46.280 --> 38:47.059
PRISONS.

38:47.079 --> 38:53.159
GOD WE HAVE SOME BAD IDEAS LIKE

38:53.179 --> 38:55.019
NO KNOCK WARRANT SEARCHES,

38:55.039 --> 38:57.119
FUCKING THREE STRIKES YOU'RE

38:57.139 --> 38:57.269
OUT, FOR-PROFIT PRISONS.

38:57.289 --> 39:00.239
IF WE JUST GET RID OF THE BAD

39:00.260 --> 39:03.090
IDEAS, BAD IDEAS LEAD TO BAD

39:03.110 --> 39:04.119
POLICY, LEAD TO PEOPLE

39:04.139 --> 39:05.050
SUFFERING.

39:05.070 --> 39:06.179
THAT'S A STEP, THIS ISN'T A

39:06.199 --> 39:07.170
FEDERAL PRISON WHICH IS NOT

39:07.190 --> 39:10.280
WHERE MOST OF THE PRISONERS ARE,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.280
BUT YOU WORKED WITH TRUMP AND

39:14.000 --> 39:15.110
THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS AND

39:15.130 --> 39:17.039
YOU SAID BEFORE, I GOT BEAT UP

39:17.059 --> 39:18.110
BY LIBERALS BY SAYING HE DID

39:18.130 --> 39:19.199
SOME GOOD THINGS, I ALWAYS

39:19.219 --> 39:20.260
COMMENDED HIM FOR THAT -- THIS

39:20.280 --> 39:22.210
IS WHAT WE NEED MORE OF.

39:22.230 --> 39:23.190
PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO SAY

39:23.210 --> 39:26.219
LET'S JUST GET TO WHAT THE TRUTH

39:26.239 --> 39:28.260
IS, NOT WHAT SIDE WE ARE ON, THE

39:28.280 --> 39:29.250
SAME THING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

39:29.269 --> 39:31.000
WITH THE VIRUS, IT'S ALWAYS

39:31.019 --> 39:35.179
ABOUT WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON.

39:35.199 --> 39:36.139
THE FIRST STEP ACT, IS THAT WHAT

39:36.159 --> 39:39.280
IT'S CALLED?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.139
>> PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL

39:41.159 --> 39:43.230
WITH THIS BUT WE GOT 14,000

39:43.250 --> 39:45.289
PEOPLE OUT OF FEDERAL PRISON

39:46.010 --> 39:46.219
EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD'VE

39:46.239 --> 39:48.130
GOTTEN WHICH IS A VERY GOOD

39:48.150 --> 39:50.050
THING AND AT SOME OF THE STUFF

39:50.070 --> 39:52.050
OBAMA WAS ABLE TO DO ON THE

39:52.070 --> 39:54.059
CRACK COCAINE DISPARITY, THAT

39:54.079 --> 39:55.079
WASN'T RETROACTIVE.

39:55.099 --> 39:58.289
TRUMP MADE OBAMA'S POLICY, A

39:59.010 --> 40:00.269
DISTINCTION BETWEEN CRACK AND

40:00.289 --> 40:01.260
POWDER COCAINE DONE

40:01.280 --> 40:04.239
RETROACTIVELY, THAT GOT A LOT OF

40:04.260 --> 40:06.000
PEOPLE GOING.

40:06.019 --> 40:06.219
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

40:06.239 --> 40:09.250
MY VIEW ON THIS IS TRUMP DID

40:09.269 --> 40:11.170
THAT FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL

40:11.190 --> 40:13.099
REASONS, DEMOCRATS LIKE MYSELF

40:13.119 --> 40:14.239
WOULD DO IT FOR A DIFFERENT SET

40:14.260 --> 40:16.079
OF REASONS BUT THE 14,000 PEOPLE

40:16.099 --> 40:17.170
WHO CAME HOME WERE HAPPY TO COME

40:17.190 --> 40:19.230
HOME, THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE

40:19.250 --> 40:20.110
POLITICS IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

40:20.130 --> 40:22.070
THEY WANTED TO GO HOME TO THEIR

40:22.090 --> 40:22.179
MOTHER'S HOUSE.

40:22.199 --> 40:26.079
WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON

40:26.099 --> 40:27.039
THAT.

40:27.059 --> 40:28.090
>> Bill: THAT WAS THE FIRST

40:28.110 --> 40:31.250
STEP ACT, WITH THE SECOND STEP?

40:31.269 --> 40:34.150
THAT'S 14,000.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.210
>> I'M PART OF THE REFORM

40:36.230 --> 40:37.190
ALLIANCE, WE GOT LEGISLATION IN

40:37.210 --> 40:40.159
MULTIPLE STATES TO DEAL WITH

40:40.179 --> 40:41.219
PROBATION AND PAROLE REFORM, A

40:41.239 --> 40:43.099
LOT OF STUFF CAN GET DONE BUT

40:43.119 --> 40:45.110
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT CRIMINAL

40:45.130 --> 40:49.239
JUSTICE IS DEMOCRATS LIKE IT FOR

40:49.260 --> 40:50.239
RACIAL JUSTICE AND SOCIAL

40:50.260 --> 40:52.289
JUSTICE BUT REPUBLICANS LIKE IT

40:53.010 --> 40:53.159
BECAUSE IT SAVES MONEY AND

40:53.179 --> 40:55.059
LIBERTARIANS DON'T LIKE IT

40:55.079 --> 40:55.250
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS TOO

40:55.269 --> 40:59.159
MUCH POWER AND SOME RELIGIOUS

40:59.179 --> 41:01.050
CONSERVATIVES ASK WHERE IS THE

41:01.070 --> 41:02.039
REDEMPTION, WHERE DOES A FALLEN

41:02.059 --> 41:04.130
CENTER GET A CHANCE TO RISE

41:04.150 --> 41:04.269
AGAIN?

41:04.289 --> 41:05.250
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

41:05.269 --> 41:09.210
HAVE A SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH,

41:09.230 --> 41:11.000
FIFTH STEP AND WE'LL FIGHT FOR

41:11.019 --> 41:11.099
IT THIS YEAR.

41:11.119 --> 41:13.280
>> Bill: YOU THINK BIDEN WILL

41:14.000 --> 41:16.230
FIND PEOPLE TO WORK WITH ON THI

41:16.250 --> 41:16.289
THIS?

41:17.010 --> 41:19.019
>> ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE?

41:19.039 --> 41:19.110
ABSOLUTELY.

41:19.130 --> 41:21.239
YOU KNOW THIS.

41:21.260 --> 41:22.239
>> Bill: YOU COULD HAVE SAID

41:22.260 --> 41:24.079
THAT FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS AND

41:24.099 --> 41:26.210
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, IT'S VERY

41:26.230 --> 41:26.280
EXPENSIVE.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.139
WE SPEND LIKE $300 BILLION

41:29.159 --> 41:30.179
POLICING AND INCARCERATING

41:30.199 --> 41:31.110
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.

41:31.130 --> 41:34.090
>> IT'S NOT WORKING OUT.

41:34.110 --> 41:34.289
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY ON THIS

41:35.010 --> 41:40.099
IN PARTICULAR.

41:40.119 --> 41:40.260
$80 BILLION LITERALLY JUST

41:40.280 --> 41:42.130
LOCKING PEOPLE UP AND MAKING

41:42.150 --> 41:43.090
THEM WORSE, YOU COULDN'T COME UP

41:43.110 --> 41:44.230
WITH A BETTER WAY TO WASTE MONEY

41:44.250 --> 41:47.119
THEN TAKE A KID OFF THE STREET

41:47.139 --> 41:49.239
AND SPENT $120,000 A YEAR

41:49.260 --> 41:50.170
BRUTALIZING THEM AND SENDING

41:50.190 --> 41:51.099
THEM HOME.

41:51.119 --> 41:54.179
TAKE THAT $120,000, GIVE IT TO A

41:54.199 --> 41:55.280
BLACK GRANDMA AND SEE WHAT SHE

41:56.000 --> 41:57.070
DOES WITH THAT KID, HE'S GOING

41:57.090 --> 41:59.139
TO WIND UP AT HARVARD.

41:59.159 --> 42:02.099
IF WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE OUR

42:02.119 --> 42:03.030
COMMUNITIES SAFE, STOP SPENDING

42:03.050 --> 42:03.250
MONEY HURTING PEOPLE AND USE

42:03.269 --> 42:06.010
MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE HERE THAT

42:06.030 --> 42:07.070
IS POSSIBLE AND WHAT YOU'RE

42:07.090 --> 42:09.030
SEEING IS IN STATES LIKE TEXAS

42:09.050 --> 42:10.250
AND GEORGIA, THEY'RE ACTUALLY

42:10.269 --> 42:13.139
DOING IT IN RED STATES, IT'S

42:13.159 --> 42:13.269
BEGINNING TO WORK.

42:13.289 --> 42:14.269
[APPLAUSE]

42:14.289 --> 42:16.170
>> Bill: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

42:16.190 --> 42:18.059
SAVING MONEY, YOU'RE SAYING THE

42:18.079 --> 42:20.099
ANSWER IS WITH MONEY BUT THAT'S

42:20.119 --> 42:22.210
ALSO THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE

42:22.230 --> 42:23.269
STARTED WITH FOR-PROFIT PRISONS.

42:23.289 --> 42:25.170
WHERE ARE THE FOR-PROFIT

42:25.190 --> 42:26.199
PRISONS?

42:26.219 --> 42:29.119
USUALLY IN RURAL COUNTIES, AND

42:29.139 --> 42:29.250
MY RIGHT?

42:29.269 --> 42:32.269
YOU'RE TAKING PEOPLE FROM URBAN

42:32.289 --> 42:34.019
AREAS AND PUTTING THEM IN

42:34.039 --> 42:35.269
PRISONS WHERE PEOPLE'S JOBS --

42:35.289 --> 42:38.059
THEY AREN'T PRISONERS, THEIR

42:38.079 --> 42:39.260
CUSTOMERS.

42:39.280 --> 42:43.179
YOU NEED THE CONTINUAL SUPPLY OF

42:43.199 --> 42:44.210
CUSTOMERS, THE INCENTIVE IS THE

42:44.230 --> 42:46.019
PROBLEM.

42:46.039 --> 42:47.170
>> WITH PRIVATE PRISONS, IT'S

42:47.190 --> 42:48.289
EVEN GREATER INCENTIVE IN THE

42:49.010 --> 42:49.269
STATES PRISONS AND THAT'S WHAT

42:50.000 --> 42:54.099
DRIVES MOST OF THIS GOING ON.

42:54.119 --> 42:55.190
I THINK THE MORAL ARGUMENT

42:55.210 --> 42:56.289
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

42:57.010 --> 42:57.239
SOMETHING THAT'S FOUND A LOT OF

42:57.260 --> 42:59.269
PURCHASE IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS

42:59.289 --> 43:00.159
BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER ACROSS

43:00.179 --> 43:03.090
POLITICAL LINES IN PARTICULARLY

43:03.110 --> 43:03.280
WITH REGARD TO RELIGIOUS

43:04.000 --> 43:05.159
CONSERVATIVES -- I DO A LOT OF

43:05.179 --> 43:06.269
REPORTING ON THAT AND IT'S

43:06.289 --> 43:08.280
AMAZING HOW OFTEN PEOPLE TALK

43:09.000 --> 43:10.019
ABOUT REDEMPTION, HOW OFTEN

43:10.039 --> 43:13.110
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE WAYS IN

43:13.130 --> 43:13.289
WHICH --

43:14.010 --> 43:15.010
>> Bill: VIS-A-VIS PRISONERS?

43:15.030 --> 43:18.099
>> YEAH, THE WAY IN WHICH THE

43:18.119 --> 43:18.269
CHURCH HAS FAILED TO LEAD ON

43:18.289 --> 43:22.219
THIS ISSUE AND I'M WORKING ON A

43:22.239 --> 43:23.039
PIECE ABOUT IT.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.179
I FOUND IT TO BE A SHOCKING

43:25.199 --> 43:26.139
SEA CHANGE.

43:26.159 --> 43:28.039
THE IDEA THAT BIDEN AND

43:28.059 --> 43:30.030
PARTICULARLY -- BECAUSE THIS IS

43:30.050 --> 43:31.139
WHERE IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO

43:31.159 --> 43:33.110
CHANGE -- THE IDEA WE CAN'T DO

43:33.130 --> 43:34.239
THIS IS THE KIND OF ROADBLOCK

43:34.260 --> 43:35.190
THAT'S BEEN THROWN UP THAT I

43:35.210 --> 43:36.099
DON'T THINK HAS A LOT OF

43:36.119 --> 43:37.260
PURCHASE IN REALITY.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.210
>> YOU SAID SOMETHING MUCH MORE

43:40.230 --> 43:42.190
RADICAL IN THAT IT'S NOT JUST

43:42.210 --> 43:44.050
PRIVATE PRISONS, ALSO THE PUBLIC

43:44.070 --> 43:46.039
PRISONS HAVE THAT SAME INCENTIVE

43:46.059 --> 43:50.079
TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN.

43:50.099 --> 43:52.210
>> Bill: THE PRISON GUARDS

43:52.230 --> 43:53.179
UNION WANTS THE CUSTOMERS.

43:53.199 --> 43:57.010
>> ONCE YOU HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE

43:57.030 --> 43:58.030
INFECTING YOUR JUSTICE SYSTEM

43:58.050 --> 43:59.289
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET JUSTICE

44:00.010 --> 44:00.230
ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T

44:00.250 --> 44:02.170
AFFORD A GREAT LAWYER.

44:02.190 --> 44:04.099
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS LET'S

44:04.119 --> 44:05.059
REVERSE THE WHOLE THING.

44:05.079 --> 44:06.269
PAY THE WARDENS WHEN SOMEBODY

44:06.289 --> 44:07.150
GETS OUT OF PRISON AND GETS A

44:07.170 --> 44:09.110
JOB AND STAYS HOME.

44:09.130 --> 44:13.039
NOW THAT WORD TO MIKE WORDEN IS

44:13.059 --> 44:14.199
GOING TO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE

44:14.219 --> 44:16.260
SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS IN THERE

44:16.280 --> 44:18.090
AS OPPOSED TO WAITING FOR REPEAT

44:18.110 --> 44:18.199
CUSTOMERS.

44:18.219 --> 44:19.170
>> Bill: AT THE PHILOSOPHY

44:19.190 --> 44:23.190
THAT WE SHOULD USE WITH

44:23.210 --> 44:25.119
HEALTH CARE, REWARD HEALTH

44:25.139 --> 44:27.110
INSTEAD OF SICKNESS.

44:27.130 --> 44:31.039
IF [APPLAUSE]

44:31.059 --> 44:33.119
WE JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT

44:33.139 --> 44:33.190
ANYMORE.

44:33.210 --> 44:37.010
>> BUT WE DO HAVE BIDEN.

44:37.030 --> 44:40.130
>> Bill: OH JESUS CHRIST,

44:40.150 --> 44:44.269
CHAMP AND MAJOR.

44:44.289 --> 44:47.150
SO WHERE IS TRUMP?

44:47.170 --> 44:48.119
IT'S LIKE HE'S IN THE WHERE ARE

44:48.139 --> 44:53.210
THEY NOW?

44:53.230 --> 44:55.170
I'M SO SHOCKED THIS GUY HAS BEEN

44:55.190 --> 44:55.250
SO QUIET.

44:55.269 --> 44:57.210
>> DID YOU GET THAT EMAIL HE

44:57.230 --> 44:59.010
SENT OUT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE

44:59.030 --> 45:04.179
FORMER PRESIDENT?

45:04.199 --> 45:04.260
[LAUGHTER]

45:04.280 --> 45:09.090
EVERY JOURNALIST I KNOW.

45:09.110 --> 45:11.050
GOT THIS THAT SHIT EMAIL FROM

45:11.070 --> 45:11.199
THE OFFICE OF THE FORMER

45:11.219 --> 45:15.139
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCING THEY ARE

45:15.159 --> 45:16.280
REBUILDING AND HE'S GOING TO

45:17.000 --> 45:18.039
CONSTANTLY WORK ON THE SURFACE F

45:18.059 --> 45:19.110
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WHAT

45:19.130 --> 45:20.099
HE'S GOING TO BE DOING I DON'T

45:20.119 --> 45:21.239
KNOW BUT IT WAS A FASCINATING

45:21.260 --> 45:24.070
EMAIL TO GET.

45:24.090 --> 45:29.179
>> Bill: I SEE SOUTH FLORIDA

45:29.199 --> 45:31.239
NOW IS THE NEW ARGENTINA,

45:31.260 --> 45:36.010
THERE'S A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN

45:36.030 --> 45:37.150
THAT ORBIT, AROUND MAR-A-LAGO IS

45:37.170 --> 45:42.039
THE CENTER OF IT.

45:42.059 --> 45:43.289
I JUST DON'T TRUST -- IT'S SO

45:44.010 --> 45:45.230
NOT LIKE HIM, RADIO SILENCE IS

45:45.250 --> 45:47.010
JUST NEVER A TERM I ASSOCIATED

45:47.030 --> 45:52.010
WITH DONALD TRUMP.

45:52.030 --> 45:54.159
HE'S NOT FADING AWAY GRACEFULLY.

45:54.179 --> 45:58.070
>> HE'S NOT, KEVIN McCARTHY IS

45:58.090 --> 45:59.199
DOWN THERE TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS

45:59.219 --> 46:01.260
AFTER ALL THIS NOISE SAYING

46:01.280 --> 46:03.280
MAYBE WE DON'T WANT THIS KIND OF

46:04.000 --> 46:04.090
THING.

46:04.110 --> 46:07.150
>> THE NUMBER ONE REPUBLICAN IN

46:07.170 --> 46:11.170
THE HOUSE, KEVIN McCARTHY GOES

46:11.190 --> 46:15.199
DOWN AND BASICALLY KISSES THE

46:15.219 --> 46:15.260
RING.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.099
HE'S QUIET LIKE THE GODFATHER IN

46:17.119 --> 46:18.289
A WAY AND YOU SEE HE'S NOT

46:19.010 --> 46:21.050
GIVING UP CONTROL OF THE

46:21.070 --> 46:22.110
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

46:22.130 --> 46:24.230
I THINK THAT IS GOING TO PUT A

46:24.250 --> 46:25.110
LOT OF PRESSURE ON REPUBLICANS

46:25.130 --> 46:26.000
WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO

46:26.019 --> 46:28.260
BE ABLE TO TURN THE PAGE WHEN

46:28.280 --> 46:29.289
KEVIN McCARTHY WHO KNOWS

46:30.010 --> 46:31.239
BETTER DECIDES HE'S GOING TO

46:31.260 --> 46:32.210
CONTINUE TO ALLOW DONALD TRUMP

46:32.230 --> 46:33.269
TO RUN THE PARTY INTO THE

46:33.289 --> 46:36.159
GROUND, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

46:36.179 --> 46:38.210
>> Bill: WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

46:38.230 --> 46:40.250
THIS TRIAL WHERE THE

46:40.269 --> 46:43.099
INSURRECTION TOOK PLACE WITH A

46:43.119 --> 46:46.030
JURY OF THE COCONSPIRATORS.

46:46.050 --> 46:49.110
>> AND A JURY THAT HAS ALREADY

46:49.130 --> 46:50.170
INDICATED THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

46:50.190 --> 46:52.099
CONVICT HIM, IT'S GOING TO BE

46:52.119 --> 46:53.289
ANOTHER BIG PANTOMIME THAT'S

46:54.010 --> 46:55.210
GOING TO END IN ANOTHER WASH.

46:55.230 --> 46:57.280
>> THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR

46:58.000 --> 46:58.170
IMPEACHMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF

46:58.190 --> 47:01.039
THE COUNTRY AND TRUMP HAS HALF

47:01.059 --> 47:04.190
OF THEM.

47:04.210 --> 47:08.179
AT THE END OF THE DAY --

47:08.199 --> 47:10.059
>> Bill: NO ONE ELSE COULD

47:10.079 --> 47:14.010
EVEN CLOSE, I HAVE THE GREATEST

47:14.030 --> 47:15.050
AMOUNT OF IMPEACHMENTS OF

47:15.070 --> 47:17.150
ANYBODY, NO ONE CAN DENY THAT."

47:17.170 --> 47:20.030
I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE MORE

47:20.050 --> 47:21.289
THING BEFORE WE GO TO NEW RULES.

47:22.010 --> 47:23.030
WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A RECALL IN

47:23.050 --> 47:26.260
THIS STATE, DON'T DO IT, DON'T

47:26.280 --> 47:28.150
DO IT.

47:28.170 --> 47:29.159
I HAVE MY FRUSTRATIONS WITH

47:29.179 --> 47:31.210
CALIFORNIA, I'VE BEEN NOT SHY

47:31.230 --> 47:32.269
ABOUT VOICING THEM BUT GAVIN

47:32.289 --> 47:35.170
NEWSOM, HE'S A SMART GUY, HE'S A

47:35.190 --> 47:37.010
GOOD GUY, I WOULD WANT TO TALK

47:37.030 --> 47:38.030
TO THEM IN A ROOM AND CONVINCE

47:38.050 --> 47:40.130
THEM OF A FEW THINGS, BUT PLEASE

47:40.150 --> 47:42.139
DON'T DO THIS, IT'S STUPID.

47:42.159 --> 47:45.239
>> IT'S Q AND ON TAKE OVER THE

47:45.260 --> 47:48.019
STATE.

47:48.039 --> 47:52.150
OF >> Bill: ESTATE OF

47:52.170 --> 47:52.239
40 MILLION.

47:52.260 --> 47:54.260
>> I'M WORKING ON A STORY RIGHT

47:54.280 --> 47:56.030
NOW ABOUT RURAL CALIFORNIA AND I

47:56.050 --> 47:57.110
TELL YOU WHATEVER YOU THINK IS

47:57.130 --> 47:58.219
NOT A CONSPIRACY, IT IS

47:58.239 --> 48:01.099
SOMETHING THAT IS A REAL

48:01.119 --> 48:01.269
GROUNDSWELL.

48:01.289 --> 48:04.219
IT FEELS LIKE OHIO IN 2016.

48:04.239 --> 48:05.210
>> Bill: WE HAVE FRUSTRATIONS

48:05.230 --> 48:09.079
WITH THE STATE, I SAID THEM,

48:09.099 --> 48:12.039
THIS IS NOT HELPING, HE'S A GOOD

48:12.059 --> 48:13.130
GUY, I THINK EVERYBODY IN

48:13.150 --> 48:15.150
POLITICS, IT'S A TOUGH JOB, YOU

48:15.170 --> 48:16.170
NEED A MINUTE TO GET YOUR FEET

48:16.190 --> 48:19.150
AND TO GET YOUR SHIP RIGHTED,

48:19.170 --> 48:22.150
KENNEDY FUCKED UP AT THE

48:22.170 --> 48:25.219
BEGINNING, EVERYONE FUCKS UP AT

48:25.239 --> 48:27.010
THE BEGINNING EXCEPT JOE BIDEN,

48:27.030 --> 48:27.110
HE'S PERFECT.

48:27.130 --> 48:28.079
[LAUGHTER]

48:28.099 --> 48:30.119
I GOT TO GO TO NEW RULES.

48:30.139 --> 48:33.150
NEW RULES!

48:33.170 --> 48:35.210
NEW RULE, NOW THAT DR. FAUCI

48:35.230 --> 48:37.090
SAYS WEARING TWO MASKS IS MORE

48:37.110 --> 48:38.219
EFFECTIVE THAN JUST ONE, LET'S

48:38.239 --> 48:40.110
NOT STOP THERE, LET'S WEAR THE

48:40.130 --> 48:42.030
SAME NUMBER OF MASKS AS WE HAVE

48:42.050 --> 48:46.280
BLADES IN OUR RAZORS -- FIVE.

48:47.000 --> 48:47.269
THE FIRST MASK GENTLY LIFTS THE

48:47.289 --> 48:49.159
VIRUS FROM THE SKIN, THE SECOND

48:49.179 --> 48:51.280
TRAPS THE VIRUS SO IT CAN'T

48:52.000 --> 48:53.269
ESCAPE, THE THIRD MASK SITS ON

48:53.289 --> 48:55.130
THE VIRUSES SHOULDERS AND MAKES

48:55.150 --> 48:56.190
IT START HITTING ITSELF.

48:56.210 --> 48:57.280
THE FOURTH ESCORTS YOUR FACE

48:58.000 --> 49:00.119
WITH PURE RAIL WHILE IT SINGS

49:00.139 --> 49:01.239
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TWICE, THE FIFTH

49:01.260 --> 49:07.219
HIGHEHIDES HER FACE SO NO ONE KS

49:07.239 --> 49:08.260
WHO THAT IDIOT IS IT'S WEARING

49:08.280 --> 49:11.059
FIVE MASKS.

49:11.079 --> 49:13.280
NEW RULE: NOW THAT WE KNOW NASAL

49:14.000 --> 49:16.199
SWABS ARE MORE ACCURATE AT

49:16.219 --> 49:17.170
DETECTING COVID THAN ORAL SWABS

49:17.190 --> 49:22.280
AND BA ANAL SWABS ARE MORE

49:23.000 --> 49:25.090
ACCURATE, SOMEONE MUST OPEN A

49:25.110 --> 49:27.179
TESTING FACILITY THAT DOES ALL

49:27.199 --> 49:29.239
THREE.

49:29.260 --> 49:32.090
SWABBY LOBBY.

49:32.110 --> 49:36.250
IF WHAT CAN OPEN UP AND SAY AH

49:36.269 --> 49:41.019
OR BEND OVER AND SAY UGH.

49:41.039 --> 49:42.210
NEW RULE: NOW THAT THERE'S AN

49:42.230 --> 49:44.019
APP THAT LETS YOU RENT YOUR

49:44.039 --> 49:45.079
GARAGE TO STRANGERS AND SWIMMING

49:45.099 --> 49:47.099
POOL TO STRANGERS, TELL ME AGAIN

49:47.119 --> 49:50.119
WHY PROSTITUTION IS ILLEGAL?

49:50.139 --> 49:53.190
[APPLAUSE]

49:53.210 --> 49:54.260
BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER SELL MY

49:54.280 --> 49:57.210
ASS TO A STRANGER THAN LET A

49:57.230 --> 49:59.280
STRANGER BRING HIS KIDS OVER TO

50:00.000 --> 50:01.179
PISS IN MY POOL.

50:01.199 --> 50:02.130
HERE'S A CONVERSATION I NEVER

50:02.150 --> 50:06.280
WANT TO HAVE "HEY BILL, WANT TO

50:07.000 --> 50:08.039
HANG OUT?

50:08.059 --> 50:12.079
I CAN'T, I RENTED A POOL TO MY

50:12.099 --> 50:14.039
BAPTISM."

50:14.059 --> 50:16.000
IF YOU OWN MORE THAN TWO FUNNY

50:16.019 --> 50:19.019
T-SHIRTS ABOUT WINE, GET HELP.

50:19.039 --> 50:21.070
HERE'S A GOOD TEST FOR YOU IF

50:21.090 --> 50:23.250
YOUR WINE T-SHIRT IS ACTUALLY

50:23.269 --> 50:24.079
SAD.

50:24.099 --> 50:28.250
REPLACE THE WORD WINE WITH

50:28.269 --> 50:29.010
CRACK.

50:29.030 --> 50:31.139
LIKE "MAMA NEEDS CRACK."

50:31.159 --> 50:35.019
OR OH LOOK IT'S CRACK O'CLOCK.

50:35.039 --> 50:37.019
OR I TRIED RUNNING BUT IT KEPT

50:37.039 --> 50:38.159
SPILLING MY CRACK.

50:38.179 --> 50:39.219
BEFORE YOU BUY AND I LOVE WINE

50:39.239 --> 50:44.030
T-SHIRT FOR YOUR MOM, IMAGINE

50:44.050 --> 50:49.110
JEANINE PIRRO IN IT.

50:49.130 --> 50:51.260
NEW RULE: BEFORE YOU SAY BEER

50:51.280 --> 50:53.280
YOGA WHERE YOU DO YOGA WHILE

50:54.000 --> 50:55.199
DRINKING BEER IS NOT FOR YOU,

50:55.219 --> 50:56.289
JUST THINK OF HOW HANDY IT WILL

50:57.010 --> 50:59.059
COME IN WHEN YOU GET HAMMERED

50:59.079 --> 51:02.230
AND NEED TO PISS IN AN ALLEY.

51:02.250 --> 51:03.010
[LAUGHTER]

51:03.030 --> 51:07.070
[APPLAUSE]

51:07.090 --> 51:09.130
AND FINALLY NEW RULE, WHEN YOUR

51:09.150 --> 51:10.039
RIOTING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND

51:10.059 --> 51:17.199
HE LOSES, STOP.

51:17.219 --> 51:17.280
[APPLAUSE]

51:18.000 --> 51:18.199
THIS MONTH RADICALS IN PORTLAND

51:18.219 --> 51:20.260
AND SEATTLE TOOK TO THE STREETS

51:20.280 --> 51:22.019
IN A PROTEST AGAINST THE

51:22.039 --> 51:23.210
PRESIDENT WHO FOR FAR TOO LONG

51:23.230 --> 51:25.230
HAS PRESIDED OVER CORRUPTION AND

51:25.250 --> 51:29.070
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, JOE BIDEN.

51:29.090 --> 51:30.260
THAT'S RIGHT, JOE WAS

51:30.280 --> 51:31.150
PRESIDENT FOR ONE DAY WHEN

51:31.170 --> 51:33.250
PROTESTERS WENT TO TOWN ON

51:33.269 --> 51:35.019
BUILDINGS, STOREFRONTS, GARBAGE

51:35.039 --> 51:36.159
CANS AND OF COURSE THEY BROKE

51:36.179 --> 51:38.210
WINDOWS AT STARBUCKS BECAUSE

51:38.230 --> 51:40.079
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY IN THAT

51:40.099 --> 51:42.099
INSURANCE COMMERCIAL, IT'S WHAT

51:42.119 --> 51:44.099
YOU DO.

51:44.119 --> 51:47.190
[LAUGHTER]

51:47.210 --> 51:49.219
[LAUGHS]

51:49.239 --> 51:51.210
I UNDERSTAND THE IMPETUS FOR

51:51.230 --> 51:52.280
STREET FIGHTINGS AT TIMES AND

51:53.000 --> 51:53.250

51:55.239 --> 51:57.119
AN ISSUE, IMPORTANT.

51:57.139 --> 52:02.039

52:11.289 --> 52:12.190
[APPLAUSE]

52:12.210 --> 52:12.269
[LAUGHTER]

52:12.289 --> 52:14.170
NOW THAT NORMALITY IS BACK AND

52:14.190 --> 52:16.139
THERE'S AT LEAST A CHANCE THAT

52:16.159 --> 52:17.210
GOVERNMENT CAN FUNCTION AGAIN,

52:17.230 --> 52:18.210
WE NEED TO BE REMINDED OF

52:18.230 --> 52:23.159
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT.

52:23.179 --> 52:24.179
MAKING PROGRESS, REAL PROGRESS

52:24.199 --> 52:25.070
THAT ACTUALLY CHANGES THE LIVES

52:25.090 --> 52:29.090
OF REAL PEOPLE COMES MAINLY FROM

52:29.110 --> 52:30.079
DOLE, PATIENT PLOTTERS WHO PUT

52:30.099 --> 52:33.139
IN THEIR 10,000 HOURS MASTERING

52:33.159 --> 52:35.159
THE DETAILS OF PUBLIC SERVICE.

52:35.179 --> 52:37.010
IT COMES FROM PEOPLE TRAPPED IN

52:37.030 --> 52:39.199
TINY ROOMS AT 3:00 A.M. WITH

52:39.219 --> 52:41.260

FEW WILL EVER READ OR THANK THEM

52:46.019 --> 52:46.050

52:46.070 --> 52:48.219
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE SEXY ANSWER

52:48.239 --> 52:50.039
BUT CHANGE COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO

52:50.059 --> 52:52.219

53:35.159 --> 53:38.030
HENRY WAXMAN AND NOT JUST THE

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

NURSING HOME REFORM, FOOD SAFETY

53:57.059 --> 53:59.039
PEOPLE HEALTHIER BETWEEN 1975

53:59.059 --> 54:01.090

GET THE CIGARETTES OUT OF FIRING

54:03.239 --> 54:04.030

54:04.050 --> 54:07.050
AS ONE TOP REPUBLICAN SAID, 15%

54:07.070 --> 54:11.000
OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET WAS

54:11.019 --> 54:12.179
CREATED BY HENRY WAXMAN WHEN NO

54:12.199 --> 54:13.199
ONE WAS LOOKING AND THAT'S THE

54:13.219 --> 54:15.010
THING ABOUT BEING A WORKHORSE

54:15.030 --> 54:15.230
INSTEAD OF A SHOW HORSE, NO

54:15.250 --> 54:18.289
ONE'S WORKING.

54:19.010 --> 54:20.000
WAXMAN NEVER WENT ON THE SUNDAY

54:20.019 --> 54:22.010
TALK SHOWS, HE DIDN'T DO TV AT

54:22.030 --> 54:23.059
ALL, THE CAMERA DIDN'T LOVE HIM

54:23.079 --> 54:29.010
AND THE FEELING WAS MUTUAL.

54:29.030 --> 54:30.019
WE ASKED HIM WANTS TO DO OUR

54:30.039 --> 54:33.070
SHOW AND HE SAID NO, I'M TOO

54:33.090 --> 54:33.139
BUSY.

54:33.159 --> 54:34.269
HE DIDN'T EVEN PUT HIMSELF ON

54:34.289 --> 54:37.139
THE COVER OF HIS OWN BOOK, HE

54:37.159 --> 54:39.139
COULD'VE PUBLISHED "RELENTLESS

54:41.219 --> 54:44.019
TAKERS WHO TOOK IT."

54:44.039 --> 54:45.150
BUT THAT WASN'T HIS STYLE.

54:45.170 --> 54:49.150
HIS STYLE WAS GETTING STUFF

54:49.170 --> 54:50.110
DONE.

54:50.130 --> 54:51.159

55:09.150 --> 55:15.139
