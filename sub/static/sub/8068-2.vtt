00:03.871 --> 00:08.742
[theme music]

00:46.680 --> 00:49.083
[laughing]

00:55.756 --> 00:57.691
All right, who stole the
batteries out of my flashlight?

00:57.791 --> 00:58.792
Wasn't me.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.395
Why don't you ask Darlene?

01:01.495 --> 01:02.363
Darlene?

01:02.463 --> 01:05.533
Carry the six.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.501
She put the
batteries in her radio.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.036
I did not.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.538
You toilet breath!

01:10.638 --> 01:13.107
Darlene, get in here!

01:13.207 --> 01:14.342
Are you gonna hit her?

01:14.442 --> 01:15.409
Nobody's gonna hit nobody.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.644
I'd hit her.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.112
Pipe down, bub.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.213
Look me in the eye, Darlene.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.186
You did it, didn't you?

01:25.286 --> 01:27.488
Well, you only caught
me 'cause Becky ratted.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.490
I caught you because
you were lying.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.724
She lies all the time.

01:30.824 --> 01:31.759
That's enough.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.127
DARLENE: Yeah, right.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.062
Why did you lie, Darlene?

01:35.163 --> 01:37.731
Well, I thought I
could get away with it.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.300
Well, you're never
going to get away with it,

01:39.400 --> 01:44.238
Darlene, because I am the
all-knowing, all-seeing mother.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.240
One lie leads to
another, Darlene.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.075
Before you know it,
you're lying all the time.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.977
You're lying to
cover up your lies.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.945
You start cheating and stealing.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.881
Pretty soon nobody likes you.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.483
You'll be living all
alone in some alley

01:55.583 --> 01:57.418
fighting stray dogs
for cold French fries.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.858
Carry the six.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.661
BECKY: I'll get it!

02:07.761 --> 02:08.696
Hello?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.931
Darlene's in big
trouble, isn't she?

02:11.031 --> 02:12.065
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

02:12.166 --> 02:15.569
Absolutely.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.271
It's for you, mother.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.539
Who is it?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.773
It's Mrs. MacElroy.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.076
Oh god, tell her I ain't home.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.078
Oh, you want me to lie.

02:25.179 --> 02:25.979
Yeah!

02:28.816 --> 02:32.786
Mrs. MacElroy, my mom says
to tell you she's not home.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.856
I oughta bust your neck.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.325
Just once.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.960
Once, I'd like to use
the batteries I buy.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.464
I go to the store, spend half a
day looking for the right size,

02:43.564 --> 02:45.866
stand in line, pay a
fortune for these things,

02:45.966 --> 02:47.868
and they disappear.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.971
Dan, I am a woman on the edge.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.544
Don't even start
about the batteries,

02:56.644 --> 02:58.446
because after the
batteries comes the radios,

02:58.546 --> 03:01.014
and then after the radio
goes the stereo speakers,

03:01.114 --> 03:02.716
and I ain't in the mood.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.589
So don't even start with
me about the batteries.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.724
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.893
I oughta bought that battery
charger, like I wanted to.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.662
It'd be out in the
garage collecting dust

03:14.762 --> 03:17.097
with all the other
junk you got out there.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.999
Hey, I dust
every one of those.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.902
[clicking flashlight]

03:22.002 --> 03:24.438
If I get that job tomorrow,
I can buy myself one.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.339
What job?

03:25.439 --> 03:26.707
Over at Spikeman Construction.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.909
Putting in a bid
on a drywall job.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.578
Great money if I get it.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.579
You're not gonna get it.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.351
Be a lot of guys betting.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.721
And they're all
better than you, I bet.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.889
Hey, I'm pretty good.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.424
- You are not.
- Yes I am!

03:43.524 --> 03:45.092
- You're not either!
- I am the best!

03:45.192 --> 03:46.159
You're the worst!

03:46.260 --> 03:47.461
I am the drywall
master of the universe!

03:47.561 --> 03:49.530
Aah!

03:49.630 --> 03:50.431
Aah!

04:10.150 --> 04:11.051
Hey, DJ.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.756
You stand on the
end of the board.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.725
I'll jump on it and
shoot you in the air, OK?

04:17.825 --> 04:18.626
OK.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.630
Ready?

04:22.730 --> 04:23.497
Ready!

04:26.099 --> 04:29.437
Freeze right there!

04:29.537 --> 04:31.038
What'd I tell you about
killing your brother

04:31.138 --> 04:31.939
in the living room?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.145
Well, we're just playing.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.547
Well, I'm not playing.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.982
You pick all these
pillows and junk up.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.351
Go clean up your room.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.385
It's clean.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.619
Then go clean my room.

04:48.656 --> 04:52.493
[humming]

04:54.061 --> 04:55.996
Pork rinds, you got the job!

04:56.096 --> 04:58.165
Drywall master
of the universe!

04:58.265 --> 05:01.935
[cheering]

05:03.471 --> 05:05.773
I figure this calls for
some hardcore festivities.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.408
I'd say so.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.308
Hey, Dad.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.543
Hey, sugar plum.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.078
Rosie, you should've seen it.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.013
Old man Spikeman calls
me into his office.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.584
Sits me down, to tell me
that I've got the job.

05:16.684 --> 05:17.618
And why?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.487
Because he wants
the job done right.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.089
And when you want the job done
right, you go to the best.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.958
You go to Dan Dan,
the Drywall Man.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.533
The man behind the woman.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.134
And look what that
man brought his woman.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.035
An advance.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.870
Give me that!

05:36.970 --> 05:38.271
Dad, how much is that?

05:38.372 --> 05:39.707
500 smackaroonies.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.308
$500?

05:41.409 --> 05:43.043
You deserve a kiss!

05:43.143 --> 05:44.277
Becky, kiss your dad.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.617
We're rich!

05:49.717 --> 05:51.051
What's wrong?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.019
We're rich, look!

05:52.119 --> 05:52.986
[laughing]

05:53.086 --> 05:53.954
Can I get some high-tops?

05:54.054 --> 05:54.922
Can I get a puppy?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.724
Can I get some designer jeans?

05:56.824 --> 05:58.025
You don't need designer jeans.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.827
You just want to show off
your heiney to all the boys.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.530
At least I have a heiney.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.832
Well, first thing, your
mother and me have to make

06:04.932 --> 06:07.468
a few fiduciary decisions.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.670
Are you going to
let us get anything?

06:09.770 --> 06:10.671
Maybe.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.407
On a scale of 10
maybes, how many?

06:13.507 --> 06:14.742
Five, maybe six.

06:14.842 --> 06:15.643
Six!

06:15.743 --> 06:16.877
It's more than half.

06:16.977 --> 06:17.878
It's almost a yes.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.379
[cheering]

06:19.480 --> 06:20.981
Whoa, hold on and listen.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
Your mother and I have
to pay a few bills first.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.618
[laughing]

06:24.718 --> 06:27.988
Well, if there is
any money left over--

06:28.088 --> 06:29.423
oh, I shouldn't tell them.
BECKY: What?

06:29.523 --> 06:30.223
DARLENE: What is it?
Come on.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.324
Oh, come on.
What?

06:31.425 --> 06:32.259
Come on!

06:32.359 --> 06:33.461
Well, if there
is any left over,

06:33.561 --> 06:35.128
we're going to build you
a great big swimming pool!

06:35.228 --> 06:37.130
[cheering]

06:37.230 --> 06:38.599
With a 50-foot slide!

06:38.699 --> 06:40.601
[cheering]

06:40.701 --> 06:41.669
And a pet shark!

06:41.769 --> 06:42.570
Yay!

06:52.112 --> 06:52.913
Honey?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.247
What?

06:54.347 --> 06:57.685
If you had an extra 50 bucks,
what would you blow it on?

06:57.785 --> 07:00.353
Buy new kids.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.689
I know what you'd buy.

07:01.789 --> 07:02.956
- No you don't.
- Yes I do.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.057
You do not.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.059
Roseanne, I know you
better than you do.

07:06.159 --> 07:11.231
Dan, you may share my
bed, but you do not know me.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.369
Be that as it may, I
know what you would buy.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.270
Mm-mmm.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.438
Yes, I do.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.607
No, you do not.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.075
You'd buy some of
that perfume you like.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.677
What's it called, Subscription?

07:27.247 --> 07:30.651
Submission!

07:30.751 --> 07:32.019
Same thing.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.020
It's not.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.588
You know you want to buy it.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.323
Admit it.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.825
You know you want it, admit it!

07:37.925 --> 07:38.892
- No.
- You do too.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.127
I do not!

07:40.227 --> 07:42.429
You put a little dab
here, and a little dab here,

07:42.530 --> 07:47.000
and a little dab here,
and a little dab here.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.368
Get away, you're
making me puke.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.109
[laughing]

07:56.209 --> 07:57.477
Know what I'd buy?

07:57.578 --> 08:00.147
Who cares?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.214
Come on, guess.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.216
No, I'm not guessing.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.955
It wouldn't by any chance be
a battery charger would it?

08:08.055 --> 08:09.256
Come on, guess.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.257
No, I don't want to guess.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.092
All right, I'll
tell you anyway.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.194
Brass captain's bell.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.930
Saw a real beauty down at
Fulton Avenue boat store.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.534
Well, don't you have to
have a boat to put it on?

08:20.634 --> 08:23.470
What do you think
making out in the garage?

08:23.571 --> 08:24.371
A hideous mess.

08:29.677 --> 08:33.814
You know, if we're real
careful with this $500?

08:33.914 --> 08:34.915
Yeah?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.350
We can just about
pay everything up,

08:37.450 --> 08:40.153
and that'll leave
us with $11.87.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.188
You're kidding.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.457
Read it and weep. $11.87.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.126
Well, at least I
can go out to dinner.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.032
Damn.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.266
I was hoping we'd have
a little extra money

08:53.366 --> 08:55.102
to play around with.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.837
Well, you want extra
money because, you know,

08:56.937 --> 08:59.506
I have my own system
for extra money.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.440
All right.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.742
[laughing]

09:01.842 --> 09:03.944
OK, first we send
in the phone bill,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.947
and we forget to sign the check.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.282
There you go!

09:09.382 --> 09:12.519
Then we send the water
bill to the electric company,

09:12.620 --> 09:15.188
and the electric bill
to the water company.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.189
Now you're cooking.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.324
And you know that
charge card bill?

09:17.424 --> 09:18.458
It never even showed up.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.130
That's illegal.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.632
Well we could call
them up and tell them

09:24.732 --> 09:27.067
that the card got ripped off.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.737
Roseanne, we've got to
get back to reality here.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.438
These bills aren't
going to go away.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.607
We've got to be responsible.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.975
Why?

09:35.075 --> 09:38.278
Because for once we finally
get a chance to get caught up.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.347
Well, you never cared
about catching up before,

09:40.447 --> 09:43.550
Mr. 1-800 "Rush me my
amazing new handy wrench."

09:46.787 --> 09:51.058
For $19.95, that was
a great investment.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.726
Yeah that's why
it's out in the garage

09:52.826 --> 09:57.297
underneath that
electric fish scaler.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.833
Hey pal, you've blown your
share of the family fortune.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.935
On what?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.437
Well, that's irrelevant.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.606
I just think we should handle
this money like adults.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.842
Fine.
We'll be adults.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.477
But I don't wanna.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.112
You will act like an adult.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.546
- You can't make me.
- Roseanne.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.815
- You can't make me!
- Roseanne!

10:14.915 --> 10:15.783
You can't make me!

10:15.883 --> 10:17.317
Roseanne, you will
act responsible!

10:21.488 --> 10:23.356
All right, I'll
act responsible.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.424
No perfume.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.325
Right.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.829
No captain's bell.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.131
Hey, Dan do you
think sometime soon

10:31.231 --> 10:32.565
you'll ever be standing
out in the driveway

10:32.666 --> 10:34.835
in front of the truck when
the brakes don't work?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.852
Well, if you ask me, you
ought to buy the perfume.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.621
Well I didn't ask
you, so just drop it.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.223
You know what your problem is?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.490
Besides you?

10:57.590 --> 10:59.492
Your problem is
that you and Dan don't

10:59.592 --> 11:00.861
know how to manage
your money, and that's

11:00.961 --> 11:02.863
why you're always broke.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.165
We're always broke because we
live with three little moochers

11:05.265 --> 11:06.299
that are sucking us dry!

11:09.069 --> 11:11.772
Crystal, did they get that
damn machine fixed yet?

11:11.872 --> 11:13.640
No, they're still
working on it.

11:13.741 --> 11:14.742
Good.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.509
You gotta learn
to treat yourself

11:16.609 --> 11:17.911
once in awhile, Roseanne.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.146
Buy yourself something.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.714
Take a vacation.

11:20.814 --> 11:24.317
Spoken like a
true single woman.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.819
It's a shame you
and Dan can't take

11:25.919 --> 11:27.487
a little bit of that
money, and go down

11:27.587 --> 11:30.123
to that theme motel in Aurora.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.326
Crystal, please.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.129
Have you seen their ads on TV?

11:36.229 --> 11:38.065
It's so romantic.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.233
Every room is a different theme.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.770
They have a roaring
twenties room, a wild west

11:42.870 --> 11:44.838
room, a Roman Empire room.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.307
Yeah, I can see Dan
getting in his chariot,

11:47.407 --> 11:49.476
going out to buy a six pack.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.978
Oh, get out.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.445
You know what I mean.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.314
Come on let's go see what
they're doing in there.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.087
How much longer?

12:00.187 --> 12:00.988
WORKER: Five more minutes!

12:04.191 --> 12:04.992
Here.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.326
What's this?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.928
Remember that $25 I borrowed?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.329
It's ten back.
- Keep it.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.798
- I don't need it.
- Take it.

12:10.898 --> 12:11.765
I don't want it.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.767
Put a down payment
on that perfume.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.436
Would you stop
with that perfume?

12:16.536 --> 12:18.538
I told you, me and Dan
decided we're not gonna spend

12:18.638 --> 12:19.873
the money on nothing frivolous.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.009
Oh, right, and you do
everything your husband

12:22.109 --> 12:23.610
tells you to do.
- Don't start.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.012
You do, Roseanne.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.146
You're just like Mom.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.215
I am nothing like that woman.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.550
You are exactly like her.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.519
Whatever hubby says, goes.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.388
Well, if I really wanted that
perfume, I would go get it.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.857
Right, Mom.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.192
Well I'll tell you something
you don't know about Mom.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.393
What?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.896
She used to pay your
friends to play with you.

12:42.996 --> 12:43.797
Shut up!

12:55.843 --> 12:57.077
- May I help you?
- Oh, no.

12:57.177 --> 12:57.978
Thank you.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.446
I was just looking.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.281
Any particular fragrance?

13:01.381 --> 13:04.952
Well, I was kind of interested
in that one Submission.

13:05.052 --> 13:08.688
We carry the complete
Submission line.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.524
Were you interested
in the body lotion,

13:11.624 --> 13:14.862
the eau de toilette, the dusting
powder, the after-bath splash?

13:23.937 --> 13:27.407
Well, I just kind of wanted
to buy the regular perfume.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.076
Oh yes, of course,
but the perfume

13:29.176 --> 13:31.912
is really the final step
in fragrance layering.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.219
Well, I wasn't that
into getting layered,

13:39.319 --> 13:46.259
I just wanted to
get the perfume.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.861
All righty.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.930
Will this be cash or charge?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.031
Charge.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.099
Never mind, I'm not getting it.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.100
I'm sorry.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.234
I'm changing my-- I'm sorry.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.937
Oh, why don't you
just try some on?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.405
I know what it smells like.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.107
It really is a
fabulous fragrance.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.042
Alluring, sensual.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.543
Men love it.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.078
Are you married?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.647
No.

14:07.747 --> 14:11.051
Well, I bet you
will have a boyfriend.

14:11.151 --> 14:15.956
Well, I am kind of shacking
up with this one guy.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.259
Trust me, a few drops of
this will really excite him.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.896
Well that's what I live
for, to excite that man.

14:26.099 --> 14:26.934
Don't we all.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.902
What's your boyfriend's name?

14:29.002 --> 14:29.903
Lance.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.271
Sexy.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.040
He's a race car driver.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.342
Oh, a man who likes danger.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.311
Well, I just know a little of
this will really turn him on.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.047
Let's face it.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.482
Deep down we women all
want the same thing,

14:42.582 --> 14:46.786
so why not use a little
help when we can get it?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.889
Well, you do have a
pretty good point there.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.192
You know what the fastest
way to a man's heart is?

14:52.292 --> 14:53.826
Yeah, through his chest.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.207
Freeze!

15:07.307 --> 15:10.010
Don't even think about it.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.311
You!

15:11.411 --> 15:12.812
[growling]

15:12.912 --> 15:13.713
You better run.

15:13.813 --> 15:14.614
You better run!

15:25.792 --> 15:26.659
DARLENE: Hey, Dad!

15:26.759 --> 15:29.696
[bell ringing]

15:29.796 --> 15:32.132
Darlene, you
shouldn't do that.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.967
You'll scare the animals.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.869
Oh, sorry.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.871
Hey, what's that?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.174
It's a rag.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.942
No, that.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.477
Nothing.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.745
Well, it's a bell.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.047
Right, it's a bell.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.217
Now scamper along.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.818
- Well, can I ring it?
- No.

15:51.918 --> 15:52.719
Well, why not?

15:52.819 --> 15:54.521
Because it's a surprise.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.955
For who?

15:56.056 --> 15:56.856
It doesn't matter for who.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.160
Now, run along into the house.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.128
For Mom?

16:01.228 --> 16:02.462
Yeah, sort of.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.863
But what if she finds out?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.565
She's not going to find out.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.566
But what if she does?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.868
I mean, what if she
asks me about it?

16:08.968 --> 16:14.441
I'd have to tell her
the truth, wouldn't I?

16:14.541 --> 16:17.510
Darlene, she's not
going to ask you about it.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.349
There's your mother now.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.950
Now, remember.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.885
[car engine revving]

16:25.985 --> 16:29.189
I won't say anything,
unless she asks me.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.157
[car door opening]

16:30.257 --> 16:32.525
Darlene, you are my favorite.

16:32.625 --> 16:44.504
[car door closing]

16:44.604 --> 16:45.505
[exhaling]

16:51.611 --> 16:52.412
DAN: You home, Roseanne?

16:52.512 --> 16:53.313
Yes!

16:58.718 --> 16:59.619
Hi, darling.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.288
Hi, I got you some corn.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.091
Oh, cool!

17:04.191 --> 17:07.160
Let me help you put
some of this stuff away.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.995
How was your day, sugar?

17:09.096 --> 17:10.230
Just fine, snookums.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.406
What are you so cheery about?

17:19.506 --> 17:21.508
I just ordered 400
pieces of sheet rock

17:21.608 --> 17:22.509
for that Spikeman job.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.277
Biggest order I ever made.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.512
Pretty neat, huh?

17:25.612 --> 17:26.813
Yeah, cool.

17:26.913 --> 17:27.947
How was your day?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.482
Oh, the usual.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.151
Oh, the machine broke down--

17:31.251 --> 17:32.185
what are you doing?

17:32.285 --> 17:33.986
Putting dish soap away.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.156
It don't go there now.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.657
Sure it does.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.161
No, it doesn't go
there anymore now.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.695
We've always kept it there.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.631
Yeah, but remember when
I started to, you know,

17:44.731 --> 17:46.566
reorganize and fix
things up and everything?

17:46.666 --> 17:47.467
Oh, really?

17:47.567 --> 17:50.337
Yeah, really.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.838
Where do you want it?

17:51.938 --> 17:52.972
It goes in the
laundry room now.

17:53.072 --> 17:53.873
Okey dokey.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.348
Ah-ha!

18:01.448 --> 18:02.315
[screaming]

18:03.850 --> 18:04.684
What is that?

18:04.784 --> 18:05.585
Nothing.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.620
Yes it is.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.655
OK, I bought that perfume.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.556
Kill me!

18:13.059 --> 18:15.262
You bought the perfume.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.231
Yes, Sherlock, I
bought the perfume.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.099
What about last night?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.534
What about it?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.203
Our little discussion.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.637
Didn't that mean
anything to you?

18:24.737 --> 18:26.573
Well, I started
talking to Jackie.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.474
Oh, Jackie.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.276
Well what about our talk?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.144
About no perfume, no bell?

18:31.244 --> 18:33.946
Were those just empty
words blowing in the wind?

18:34.046 --> 18:35.715
I shouldn't have bought it.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.218
Well you did buy it, and
that's the undeniable fact.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.118
Well, I'm taking it back.

18:39.219 --> 18:39.986
Now, wait.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.755
Just hold on a minute.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.123
I'm taking it back.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.226
Roseanne, taking it back is
not going to make either of us

18:46.326 --> 18:47.627
feel any better.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.861
Well, I'm not keeping it.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.130
I mean, every time I put
it on I'd just felt guilty.

18:51.231 --> 18:55.202
Look, would it help
if I went out right now

18:55.302 --> 18:56.169
and bought that stupid bell?

18:59.439 --> 19:03.210
Because I'd be willing
to do that for you.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.645
You already bought
that bell, didn't you?

19:09.649 --> 19:10.517
Roseanne!

19:10.617 --> 19:11.484
You did!

19:11.584 --> 19:13.119
- I didn't.
- You liar!

19:13.220 --> 19:14.187
Did not.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.888
You bought that bell!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.224
I did not.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.158
Look me in the eye and tell
me you didn't buy that bell.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.598
I didn't buy that bell.

19:25.698 --> 19:35.608
[bell ringing]

19:35.708 --> 19:37.610
Ask not for whom
the bell tolls.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.350
It tolls for thee, butthead.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.399
Ooh, that feels great.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.834
You could do this for a living.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.971
That's what old
man Spikeman said.

20:05.071 --> 20:08.275
You're sick!

20:08.375 --> 20:09.442
So, how do they look?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.211
Snug.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.681
I gotta wash them again
before I wear them to school

20:14.781 --> 20:16.416
so they'll be even tighter.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.117
How popular do you want to be?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.990
Thanks, Mom.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.858
OK, my turn.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.126
For what?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.496
I did you, now
you gotta do me.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.930
Says who?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.032
- That's the deal, Roseanne.
- What deal?

20:33.132 --> 20:34.967
I thought you were doing
it out of pure love.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.470
No way!

20:37.570 --> 20:39.439
I bear you three
beautiful children,

20:39.539 --> 20:44.176
I labor to make a
warm and loving home,

20:44.277 --> 20:46.446
and I've dedicated
my whole life to you.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.915
And all I get is a lousy
five minute foot massage?

20:52.552 --> 20:55.054
All right, three more minutes.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.889
Deal.

20:56.989 --> 21:00.293
And this little
piggy stayed home.

21:00.393 --> 21:03.963
This little piggy
had roast beef.
