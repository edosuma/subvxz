00:24.500 --> 00:26.000
I'm counting on you,aleksander.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.800
I'll call youwhen it's done.

01:28.200 --> 01:28.600
Visa.

01:33.100 --> 01:33.600
Hi.

02:03.500 --> 02:08.199
You're looking at the work of an emergingterrorist organization known as the beograd faction.

02:08.900 --> 02:13.100
Yesterday at 5:00 they hitthe indonesian embassy in copenhagen.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.100
It was their fourth major attackwithin the last several months.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.100
And their firstovertly political act.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.800
If that's in fact what it is.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.500
Just looking at their files, they haven't claimedany ideology.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
They've made no demands,no pronouncements.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.100
Something doesn't add up.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.500
Langley is desperateto acquire intel on this group.

02:28.500 --> 02:32.000
To that end, they placedan undercover agent within the organization.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.500
His name is thomas raimes.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.400
He specializes in prolongeddeep cover work.

02:36.500 --> 02:41.500
He's been in placefor the last few months posing as a document expertin forging, counterfeiting.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.700
Two weeks agohe warned langley of a pending attackin denmark.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.500
And he never followed upwith the details?

02:47.700 --> 02:51.500
Agent raimes has missedthe last four meetings with his handler and hasn'tnotified headquarters.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.200
Which means he was eithercaught or killed.

02:54.100 --> 02:59.600
In one of his lastcommunications, he was able to identifythe leader of this group, a man named milos kradic.

03:00.400 --> 03:05.200
Echelon intercepts suggestthat kradic has a meet set up tomorrow at a locationin amsterdam.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.900
Dixon, vaughn, you'll runsurveillance on that location.

03:07.900 --> 03:11.300
If kradic shows up, neutralize himand take him into custody.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.000
Sydney, coordinate with jackwhen he gets in.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.600
You'll run the operationsfrom here.

03:16.300 --> 03:20.900
Until then, find outwhat other motives they could have hadfor hitting that embassy.

03:21.200 --> 03:21.900
Okay, that's it.

03:22.000 --> 03:22.700
Thank you.

03:30.300 --> 03:30.800
Hello?

03:31.200 --> 03:31.900
Nadia.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.400
Sophia?

03:35.000 --> 03:35.800
Is that you?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.400
It's so goodto hear your voice.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.200
Yours too.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.400
I'm so surprisedyou're calling.It's been...

03:42.400 --> 03:43.800
a long time, yes.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.200
I am flying to los angeles.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.200
I was hopingwe might catch up.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.200
I'd love to.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.200
Why don't imeet you at the airport?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.900
That'll be wonderful.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.100
I arrive in the morning.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.300
Okay, I'll see you then

04:02.700 --> 04:04.900
So how long has it been since you've heardfrom sophia?

04:05.100 --> 04:06.100
Like 10 years.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.700
Why has she cometo los angeles now?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.300
I don't know.She didn't say.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.800
Are you sureyou're okay with this?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.300
She can stay as longas she wants.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.300
You know that.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.000
Thanks. 

04:15.000 --> 04:17.399
Where else am I gonna hearembarrassing stories about you as a kid?

04:20.000 --> 04:20.600
You okay?

04:20.800 --> 04:21.500
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.300
You don't seem very excited.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.500
I know, but I am.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.100
It's just last time I saw her,I was in jail.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.100
I don't want to bea disappointment to her.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.800
Who knows if she'lleven recognize me?

04:33.900 --> 04:38.900
Oceanic airlines,nonstop flight to sydney is now ready for boardingat gate 17.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.200
Oceanic airlines nonstop flightto sydney is now rdy...

04:43.900 --> 04:44.900
sophia.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.100
I'm sorry.

04:48.200 --> 04:48.900
I'm so sorry.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.100
What happened?

04:52.100 --> 04:53.800
I didn't have anywhereto go.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.800
It's so good to see you.

05:07.100 --> 05:13.400
For the last few weeks, I had a feeling that iwas being watched.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.200
I kept seeing the same faceseverywhere I went

05:17.800 --> 05:23.600
Then last nightI came home early from work, and they were in my house. 

05:23.800 --> 05:26.400
As soon as I walked in,they attacked me.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.200
What did they want?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.300
I don't know.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.600
Did they take anything?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.800
I honestly don't know.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.100
When I regainedconsciousness,

05:42.600 --> 05:45.600
the house was ransackedand they were gone.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.800
I couldn't stay there.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.400
I'm sorry I came herelike this.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.300
 It's okay.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.700
You did the right thing.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.100
We should let herget some sleep

05:55.300 --> 05:56.100
Yes

05:57.800 --> 06:00.100
I'm sorry we had to meetunder these circumstances. 

06:01.300 --> 06:03.800
You're family to nadia,which means you're familto me.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.100
I'll see to it that you'rewell taken care of.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.000
You have nothing to worryabout from now on.

06:09.700 --> 06:10.600
Thank you.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.300
That woman took careof nadia when I couldn'T.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.200
I owe her.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.700
As soon as I get backto the office, I'll reach out to ourconnections in portugal.

06:29.700 --> 06:30.600
Whatever I can do.

06:31.100 --> 06:31.900
You need a ride?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.100
No, thank you.

06:33.200 --> 06:33.700
Okay.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.200
I'll meet you there.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.800
That should takethe edge off.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.400
It's less painfuthan the last few times.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.200
Glad to hear it.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.800
I've increased the dosageof lipoic acid.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.700
Sorry to say,you may experience some increasedside effects.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.000
It's not a cure, but, um, should keep it at bayfor a while.

07:19.200 --> 07:26.100
I've been lookinginto studies from the instituteof radiology in prague based on treatment protocolsin chernobyl --

07:26.200 --> 07:27.400
it's apples and oranges,jack.

07:28.300 --> 07:32.500
We're not talking aboutalpha particles and beta particles,gamma or neutron rays.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.800
The radiationyou were exposed to when you walkedinto that reactor --

07:36.400 --> 07:38.300
well, it's a differentfruit altogether.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.200
Thene'll keep looking.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.100
20 years I've known you.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.900
You're not one iotaless stubborn.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.500
How's sydney?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.000
She's doing well.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.500
I remember when she wasjust starting school.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
Where do the years go?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
Jack, I've watchedcountless people die.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.500
Had to look into my patients'eyes when I tell them what they have is terminal.

08:05.700 --> 08:06.500
And you know what? 

08:06.900 --> 08:08.900
That stuff about laughterbeing the best medicine?

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
It's a load of bunk.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.500
I assume you have a point.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.700
A clean conscience --

08:15.800 --> 08:17.400
that's a treatmentI can stand behind.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.600
We both knowhow this is going to end.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.400
We can filter your bloodtill the cows come home, but there's no changingthe outcome.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.600
Clear your conscience,jack.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.000
That would takeanother lifetime at least.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.700
I'm not suggesngyou write your memoirs.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.500
Although I'm sure they wouldmake a hell of a read.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.100
 Start small.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.000
Talk to your daughter.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.000
She's better offnot knowing.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.000
Jack, these secretsyou're keeping --

08:50.300 --> 08:51.600
they're not yours to keep.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.100
We've been waitingover an hour

09:05.100 --> 09:06.000
Think kradic's gonna show?

09:08.200 --> 09:09.000
I hope so.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.700
You have historywith the target? 

09:14.400 --> 09:15.600
I knew the undercoveragent --

09:16.200 --> 09:16.900
raimes.

09:18.000 --> 09:18.700
From langley?

09:19.300 --> 09:20.400
We were in the corpstogether.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.000
Force recon.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.100
Toughest guy in our platoon.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.100
Didn't think the bullet wasmade that could take him down.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.100
We don't know that he's dead

09:31.100 --> 09:32.000
He could've been captured.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.800
If raimes were alive,he would have made contact.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.800
Okay, there's kradic. 

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
There's another guy there.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.100
Brown jacket.

09:51.200 --> 09:51.800
You see him?

09:56.500 --> 09:57.500
That's raimes.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.400
Do you think he's gonerogue?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.800
You've grown into a beautiful woman, you know.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.400
so different from the girl I once knew.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.000
You were so angry then.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.400
I know it's hard to believe 

10:47.900 --> 10:49.100
at least it is for me --

10:49.100 --> 10:53.300
but I have a home now, a family..

10:55.100 --> 10:57.000
I finally feel like I belong somewhere.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.600
Your father's a good man.

11:01.700 --> 11:02.400
I can tell.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.900
You should rest now.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.400
I'll be by tonight to check on you

11:11.500 --> 11:12.800
Nadia, wait.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.000
It's san marcos, the orphanage's namesake.

11:26.400 --> 11:31.100
My happiest times were there watching over you girls.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.200
I want you to have it.

11:38.900 --> 11:39.700
I can'T.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.700
Please.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.800
It is my way of thanking you for taking care of me. 

11:57.600 --> 11:58.200
Whoa!

11:59.600 --> 12:00.500
Oh, hey.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.800
I -- sorry, mr. Sloane.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.700
I was testing out a mod on a virtual imager, and, well, you looked a little freaky.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.400
There's a latent fingerprint in here.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.000
I want to get everything you can on the person it belongs to.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.400
I want it kept between us.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.200
Sure, no problem. 

12:15.700 --> 12:16.400
Thank you.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.400
Dad, dixon and vaughncalled in.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.700
They found raimes.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.500
He's alive.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.400
He's traveling with kradic.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.200
Have our team shadow raimes.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.000
The second he's alone,pull him aside for questioning.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.800
I want to know why he hasn'tcontacted langley.

12:42.900 --> 12:43.800
I'll let them know.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.700
Dad? 

12:48.400 --> 12:50.500
Let me know when dixonand vaughn have secured raimes.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.400
I'll keep you posted. 

13:20.100 --> 13:20.900
Got the target.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.600
He just ordereda whiskey straight up.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.500
Okay, go for it.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:33.700 --> 13:34.600
I didn't see you there.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.200
Cheers.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.100
We're in amsterdam.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.700
This isthe best place we can find?

13:52.900 --> 13:53.300
No.

13:53.300 --> 13:57.700
If I chose the meet, we'd be in a park or near a beautiful canal. 

14:03.900 --> 14:04.600
where are you going?

14:05.500 --> 14:06.000
where are you going?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.900
Last time I saw you like thiswas in a bar in baghdad.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.500
Marcus.

14:34.900 --> 14:35.800
What are you doing here? 

14:35.900 --> 14:37.300
Langley assumed you werecompromised.

14:37.300 --> 14:37.900
What's going on?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.400
The embassy bombing.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.100
You warned of an attacksomewhere in denmark two weeks ago, then nothing.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.600
Why didn't you senda second warning that the bomb would go off? 

14:47.900 --> 14:48.500
You know what?

14:48.500 --> 14:48.900
I'll fill out a report later.

14:48.900 --> 14:52.200
Right now I gotta getback out there, because kradicis meeting with an associate.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.200
Then talk fast.Tom, we need answers. 

14:54.200 --> 14:55.300
You don't understand.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.400
So explain it to us.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.800
Why haven't you checked inwith your handlers?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.100
Kradic is paranoid.

14:59.100 --> 14:59.900
If iwould have radioed in --

14:59.900 --> 15:01.000
there are other ways.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.300
I have to report in, tom.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.000
And right now, we're lookingat two scenarios.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.500
Either you blew your intel,or you've gone over.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.200
Which is it?

15:08.900 --> 15:10.100
You think I sold out? 

15:10.200 --> 15:11.000
 You tell us.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.700
All right, I had the intel,okay?

15:14.100 --> 15:17.000
But if I would havewarned langley, kradic would have knownwe were on to him.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.900
So you decided to let15 people die? 

15:18.900 --> 15:20.100
I had my reasons.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.200
We're listening.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.800
Kradic is after a new weapondeveloped by the indonesians.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.200
It's a water contaminant. 

15:29.500 --> 15:31.200
It can wipe outwhole ecosystems.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.000
Kradic has a line on it.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.200
The embassy bombing was crucialto acquiring the weapon.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.300
It was a handful of livesagainst a half a million.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.800
That's not your callto make.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.100
You weren't there.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.500
Now, look, if I'm notback in a few minutes, kradic is gonna knowsomething's wrong.

15:52.900 --> 15:57.200
Yes, 15 people died, but if we don't recoverthat weapon,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.600
it'll be hundredsof thousands.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.400
So, you gonna let mewalk out that door, or what? 

16:02.700 --> 16:03.800
Your call, marcus.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.500
developed a sample of hydrosec,but he didn't know where.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.200
So he bombed the embassyas cover for the intel theft. 

16:17.900 --> 16:23.400
Emergency protocoldictates that if a bomb goes off, all confidential intelligence istransferred to off-site servers.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.800
The explosion triggeredthose protocols

16:25.800 --> 16:28.200
Kradic must have beenprepared to intercept the outgoing data

16:28.300 --> 16:30.500
The location of the hydrosecmust have been in those files.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.200
He knows where it is,and now he's putting together a team to steal itfrom the indonesians.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.300
Indonesian officialsdeny their intelligence has been compromised.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.300
What else could they say?

16:39.400 --> 16:43.200
If they admit to developinghydrosec, they'd be violatinginternational weapons treaties.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.900
We're talking in circles here.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.900
The only option we've got is to make kradic lead usto the weapon.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.300
We could take him out beforehe gets a chance to use it.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.200
Dixon, what's yourtactical assessment?

16:55.000 --> 16:59.200
Considering the situatn, I think our best bet is tokeep agent raimes in the field.

16:59.700 --> 17:00.400
Agreed.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.700
You and vaughnwill shadow.

17:02.000 --> 17:02.600
Copy that.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.000
Go check on raimes.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.200
Make sure he's okay.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.000
We'll outfit you for comms.

17:16.000 --> 17:16.599
No dice.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.900
Kradic has state-of-the-artcountersurveillance detection.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.200
If I show up therewired for sound, I'll light uplike a christmas tree.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.599
Then we'll modify the comms.

17:23.700 --> 17:24.800
Spread-spectrumburst transmitters.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.700
Should be beyond kradic'scapabilities.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.700
It'll take us a few minutesto get them ready

17:28.800 --> 17:29.800
I'll brush past youwith them.

17:30.100 --> 17:30.200
Fine.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.600
I'll meet youat the bar in 10 minutes

17:32.400 --> 17:32.900
Wait.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.500
This meet --who is it?

17:35.600 --> 17:36.300
 A hacker.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
Linus halsey.Why?

17:41.900 --> 17:43.600
Does kradic know this hackerface to face?

17:43.900 --> 17:45.100
You're thinkingof switching him out?

17:46.300 --> 17:48.400
Well, you stand a better chancewith another man on the inside.

17:49.300 --> 17:49.800
Fine.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.500
But you better hurry.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.700
He'll be here in one hour.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.100
Hey, what the hell?

17:58.100 --> 17:58.900
Where did you go?

18:00.100 --> 18:01.000
Let me tell you something.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.100
Shooting whiskey on an emptystomach --

18:03.100 --> 18:03.800
not good.

18:03.800 --> 18:04.400
What's the matter?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.600
Milos pushing you around again?

18:05.600 --> 18:06.100
He's waiting.

18:06.100 --> 18:06.800
You're like a little girl.

18:06.800 --> 18:07.500
Come on, let's go.

18:09.100 --> 18:12.000
I'll start with langley,see if they have an open file on halsey.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.700
If there's a current file photo,we can run his faceprint through interpol'sbiometric city scan. 

18:15.700 --> 18:16.300
Make it fast.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.200
We don'thave much time.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.000
Mr. Sloane, sir.

18:21.300 --> 18:25.300
Mr. -- Here's that background checkthat you asked me to run.Yeah.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.800
Sophia vargas.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.500
Yeah, you actually probablyjust want to skip to the last page.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.200
Thank you, marshall.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.500
Sure.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.300
I found the hacker,linus halsey.

18:55.300 --> 19:01.200
He was an mit graduatewith a degree in nonlinear cryptoalgorithsmsand stochastic systems analysis.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.500
Because if they called it"code-breaking," they couldn't charge30 grand tuition

19:07.000 --> 19:09.500
Okay, I'm linked withamsterdam's urban surveillance network.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.200
I'm checking the databasefor hotel reservations.

19:13.200 --> 19:13.900
Got him. 

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Hotel ruisseau. 

19:15.100 --> 19:16.900
It's just a few blocks overfrom where they are.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.700
Got eyes on halsey.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.500
Okay, let me knowwhen you've got him, and I'll head inside.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.700
Shotgun, what's going on?

20:28.900 --> 20:30.200
Dixon, coming your way.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.700
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

20:49.800 --> 20:50.600
I would have had him.

20:51.200 --> 20:51.700
I know.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.300
Hey

20:57.200 --> 20:58.500
Good workon hotel ruisseau.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.600
They caught halsey.

20:59.900 --> 21:00.500
Thanks.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.400
 We aim to please.

21:01.900 --> 21:02.900
You're in a good mood.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.600
Yeah, I guess so.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.900
So things went well withsophia after we left?

21:07.100 --> 21:07.600
Yeah

21:07.900 --> 21:09.200
I've missed herso much.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.300
It's been a long time.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.200
I was so different back then

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
You wouldn't have known me.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.200
I bet I would have.

21:15.200 --> 21:15.600
No

21:15.800 --> 21:18.000
I was crazy, wild.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.900
I don't know what sophiasaw in me.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.400
She was always telling meI was her special one.

21:24.100 --> 21:29.400
For years after I leftthe oranage, that was the only thingI could hang on to.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.800
I knew someone, somewherebelieved in me. 

21:33.900 --> 21:36.000
You were lucky to have a personlike that in your life.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.000
Yeah.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
Why did you really come here?

21:45.400 --> 21:46.000
Tell me

21:47.900 --> 21:49.100
I don't know what you mean.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.600
I know all aboutjose pedraza.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.900
I know how the argentinepolice found his body.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.600
I know they founda suspect's fingerprint.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.200
But ey couldn't finda match.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.000
I did.

22:00.200 --> 22:05.200
He was hurting my girls, and I was the one who hiredhim to tend the grounds.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.100
I didn't realize.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.400
Did he hurt nadia?

22:12.700 --> 22:13.500
He tried.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.800
I didn't give himthe second chance

22:17.700 --> 22:22.100
I know what I didwas wrong, but they were my children.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.100
Yeah.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.100
I would have donethe same thing. 

22:28.800 --> 22:30.400
Still, that doesn'tanswer my question.

22:34.300 --> 22:38.600
All I ever wanted was to protect nadia.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.200
When she was brought to meas a baby, she was in danger.

22:44.200 --> 22:48.300
I changed her last nameto santos so nobody could find her.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.200
The men who attacked mein lisbon -- 

22:51.700 --> 22:53.100
they weren't after me.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.400
They werafter nadia.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.300
They wanted to knowwhat name I had given her.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.700
And what did you tell them?

23:01.400 --> 23:02.100
Nothing.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.200
Why didn't you tell nadia?

23:11.000 --> 23:16.700
When I saw her with her sister,with you... 

23:18.100 --> 23:20.500
she deserves the happinessshe's found here.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.800
I couldn't bring backall that pain to her life.

23:26.700 --> 23:27.300
Don't worry.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.400
Now I can take care of her.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
How can you be sure?

23:36.300 --> 23:38.500
 Because I knowwho's after my child.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
you wantedto show me something?

23:48.400 --> 23:48.700
Oh, yeah.

23:48.700 --> 23:49.300
Hey, syd.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.400
Yeah, check this out.

23:50.600 --> 23:56.800
Now this is one nanogramof hydrosec, which isone billionth of a gram in a 500 milliliterbeaker of water.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.400
Accordingto my simulation, the toxin actually feedsoff the water.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.400
One gram of hydrosec,lake michigan turns into sludge.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.500
It's incredible, really,you know...

24:08.400 --> 24:09.100
you know, dr.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.000
Evilsort of way.

24:11.400 --> 24:15.400
What would it taketo manufacture this stuff, level 4 biohazard containment?

24:15.400 --> 24:19.100
Yeah, and a massivecooling system, which should narrow downthe possible locations.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.200
Give me a couple hours.

24:23.700 --> 24:24.300
What's this?

24:24.500 --> 24:24.900
Huh?

24:27.400 --> 24:33.800
Uh... you know, it's just a copyof some research I'm doing for -- ahem --mr. Sloane.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.600
It's not -- damn it.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.200
What the hellare you thinking?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.300
I'm sure you mean thatin the most polite way.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.900
Using cia resourcesto check up on sophia.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.400
I was merely being cautious.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.900
I don't understand this, but nadia believes in you.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.600
omehow you've earnedher trust.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.900
Every time you lie to her,you break that bond.

25:09.700 --> 25:13.700
I want you to understandthat I'm not telling you thisout of concern for you.

25:16.300 --> 25:17.300
Only my sister.

25:25.100 --> 25:29.700
Take the highwayto the end of the night

25:30.800 --> 25:32.900
end of the night 

25:34.200 --> 25:36.000
end of the night

25:37.900 --> 25:39.400
nobody reads the paperanymore.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.200
There is too much tragedyin the world.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.400
End of the night 

25:50.900 --> 25:53.300
realms of bliss 

25:54.100 --> 25:55.800
realms of light...

25:59.500 --> 25:59.800
clean.

26:03.000 --> 26:03.700
Have a seat.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.900
Your reputation proceeds y,mr. Halsey.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.500
You're too kind.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Temperamental.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.300
Arrogant.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.200
Vindictive.

26:20.300 --> 26:20.900
Violent.

26:21.700 --> 26:22.300
Vain.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.500
Petty and deceitful.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.000
You're forgettingtalented...

26:28.100 --> 26:28.600
brilliant...

26:29.900 --> 26:31.000
and easy on the eye.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.400
There is that.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.800
You are supposedto be brilliant.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.000
They say you'rethe best hacker in the E.U.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.800
That's the rep.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.800
T what went wrongon the kroner job?

26:44.900 --> 26:46.700
Kroner job --what happened?

26:46.900 --> 26:47.500
Petty?

26:47.700 --> 26:49.900
Who the hell's thatson of a bitch to call me petty?

26:50.100 --> 26:50.600
You know what?

26:50.700 --> 26:52.000
ou can all go -- aah!

26:53.700 --> 26:54.500
Nothing went wrong.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.800
Then why does kronerhate you so much, hmm?

27:00.100 --> 27:01.800
I finished the jobas agreed. 

27:02.700 --> 27:04.100
Perfectly, I may add.

27:05.000 --> 27:05.600
Aah!

27:05.700 --> 27:07.000
Listen to me,you son of a bitch.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I'm not gonna let youhang my partner out to dry.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.600
The son of a bitchshorted me 10 grand

27:14.900 --> 27:16.400
 Kroner stiffed him10,000 euros.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.300
Then kroner turned around, forgot to pay memy 10,000 euros.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.700
That doesn't explainwhy he hates you.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.900
Now by my count, you stillhave three rings left. 

27:31.900 --> 27:32.500
That's on one ear.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.200
What happened?

27:34.800 --> 27:36.200
After he stiffed me..

27:36.300 --> 27:38.200
He hacked kroner'scredit card to buy hookers.

27:38.700 --> 27:45.400
I hacked into hiscredit card account, chard itexactly 10,000 euros to several young ladiesin the red light district,

27:46.500 --> 27:48.200
and then sent the billsto his wife.

27:50.900 --> 27:51.700
Yes, I did.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.200
We leave in an hour.

28:04.500 --> 28:07.400
Aleksander, tell the teamto meet us at tuege airfield.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.400
You wanted to see me?

28:26.000 --> 28:26.800
I was thinking...

28:28.100 --> 28:29.600
the embassy transmissionthat kradic intercepted -- 

28:29.800 --> 28:37.400
the network tap he installedwould have had to have been physically placedon the premises.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.400
I don't follow.

28:38.600 --> 28:44.000
It would be too riskyto send someone to retrieve it afterwards,so we can assume it stores the information.

28:44.200 --> 28:49.400
Which means we might be ableto access it remotely as well and download the same intelkradic got off it.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.800
This is all assumingthe indonesians haven't already locatedand removed the tap.

28:53.900 --> 28:54.600
It's worth a shot.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.800
I'll get marshall right on it. 

29:35.500 --> 29:40.700
Went into the development of this little marvel,and you yank it out with a letter opener?

29:41.700 --> 29:42.500
What are youtalking about?

29:45.500 --> 29:46.500
You don't havethe faintest --

29:48.500 --> 29:52.300
I implanted it to regulate the medicationin your bloodstream.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.100
I explained the entireprocedure to you.

29:56.200 --> 29:56.700
You did?

29:57.500 --> 29:58.000
I did.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.500
I have no memory of this.

30:03.900 --> 30:07.200
Well, we talked aboutthe fact that memory loss could be a side effect.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.100
I even implanteda second one in your calf.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.500
You don't remember that,either, do you?

30:20.200 --> 30:21.000
My position... 

30:22.700 --> 30:26.000
my job -- this side effectis unacceptable.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.500
I can adjust the medication.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.400
But your conditionis progressing quicker than I hadanticipated.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.500
Jack, have you thought any moreabout what we discussed?

30:36.500 --> 30:37.300
About sydney?

30:38.100 --> 30:40.600
Sydney has had to faceso many things in her life.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.600
Too manyfor someone so young.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.400
And now, given my condition,I don't want to burden her.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.400
 It's not fair.

30:49.900 --> 30:52.500
Honesty -- that's fair.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.800
You won'always be aroundto protect her, jack.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.600
She has to know the truthbefore it's too late.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.100
You disagreewith my decision? 

31:14.500 --> 31:15.200
The embassy?

31:17.500 --> 31:18.300
I wasn't there.

31:19.100 --> 31:20.100
I was boxed in

31:20.900 --> 31:21.900
So I made a ll.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.500
Did some civilians die?

31:25.100 --> 31:25.600
Yes

31:25.600 --> 31:26.500
Would I do it again?

31:28.500 --> 31:29.300
Absolutely.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.500
There are sacrificeswe have to make.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.400
There are casualtiesin the business that we're in.

31:36.900 --> 31:38.300
 You disappoint me, marcus.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.500
There was a timeyou understood that.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.400
That was a long time ago.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.300
Things are...

31:46.300 --> 31:46.800
different.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.000
What happened,you get religion?

31:49.200 --> 31:50.100
I had that.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.100
No, I got married.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.500
Had kids.

31:58.000 --> 31:58.700
Changes a man.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.400
You mean it softens

32:02.400 --> 32:06.100
I mean it deepens,gives a man perspective.

32:07.500 --> 32:11.500
Maybe we need menwho can make the hard call, weigh the manyagainst the few.

32:11.900 --> 32:17.100
I just know that every timeI think of those 15 people at the embassy,

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
it weighs on me.

32:30.700 --> 32:31.600
How many kids you got?

32:33.000 --> 32:36.500
A daughter, robin,and a son, steven.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.100
And the lucky lady?

32:42.300 --> 32:43.900
My wife was killeda few years ago

32:47.100 --> 32:50.300
What you would call a casualtyof the business we're in. 

33:22.500 --> 33:24.300
Make sure the plane'sready to go.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.600
Ooh, hope it's warmwhere we're going, 'cause this weather'skilling me.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.600
We are 15 minutesbehind schedule.

33:32.900 --> 33:34.200
We'll have to make it upin the air.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Vaughn just checked in.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.300
Kradic's men just arrivedat tuege airfield. 

33:38.600 --> 33:41.800
Marshall was able to runa network probe at the indonesian embassy.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.100
It turns outmy father was right.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.600
We've got a sourceon the hydrosec.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.200
It'sn a manufacturing plantin peru.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.900
Unfortunately,kradic beat us to it.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.200
He must have had a teamin place.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.300
Four hours ago there was a firein one of the research labs.

33:53.300 --> 33:57.000
Our theory is that kradic'smen caused the accident to steal the hydrosec.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.100
It fits their M.O.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.400
Using disaster to achievetheir operational objectives.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.800
Well, the big question is,since they have it, where do they planto use it? 

34:05.700 --> 34:08.699
It's most likely that kradicwill set up a rendezvous with the heist team.

34:08.900 --> 34:12.100
Our best course of actionwould still be to keep dixon in play.

34:12.900 --> 34:13.600
That's it.

34:19.699 --> 34:20.699
Something else, jack? 

34:23.900 --> 34:27.800
I know we agreed to keep thisbetween ourselves, but the time has arrived.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.699
Personal considerations havebeen weighing on me, arvin.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.300
We need to tell themthe truth. 

34:40.300 --> 34:41.300
 Yes, I know.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.400
You're right.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.900
I'm afraid that nadia'salready in danger.

34:55.100 --> 34:57.200
Fully fueled and readyto take us over the border.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.300
Get the gear.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.100
Let's move.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.100
I'm in place.

35:08.100 --> 35:08.800
Do you read?

35:09.000 --> 35:09.700
Go ahead.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.700
Kradic has gathereda total of six team members, and they're en routeto the plane.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.300
And agent dixon is still embedded?

35:18.300 --> 35:19.000
Securely.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.300
Hey!

35:35.200 --> 35:36.000
What's going on? 

35:38.600 --> 35:39.700
Outrigger,I'm in position.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.600
I have a better question.

35:42.700 --> 35:46.200
Which one of you twois agent dixon? 

35:49.300 --> 35:50.400
What?

35:50.500 --> 35:51.400
Oh, man,you're out of your mind.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.200
Milos, come on.Put the gun down.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.000
Take it easy.

35:53.000 --> 35:53.600
Enough!

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Aleksander intercepteda transmission.

35:56.200 --> 35:56.700
Transmission?

35:56.700 --> 35:57.200
What are you talking about?

35:57.200 --> 35:58.500
You're just being paranoid.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.200
I knowone of you is an agent.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.200
If I move any closer, I'll bemade

36:02.200 --> 36:03.700
Do you have a weapon?

36:03.800 --> 36:04.200
Milos, come on.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.200
 Let's talkthis thing through.

36:05.200 --> 36:05.700
Come on. 

36:06.200 --> 36:08.900
We are not doing anythingtill I find out the truth!

36:10.200 --> 36:12.000
I sensed somethingwas wrong about you. 

36:12.000 --> 36:12.600
No, no, no.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.300
You wrong!

36:14.300 --> 36:15.500
You know my reputation.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.600
You checked out the kroner job. 

36:16.800 --> 36:18.800
I should have trustedmy instincts.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.200
Now, see, this is insane.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.200
I'm not an agent!

36:22.000 --> 36:22.700
Take it easy.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Who do you work for?

36:24.900 --> 36:25.500
Cia?

36:25.500 --> 36:26.200
Mossad?

36:26.200 --> 36:27.400
Man, what you talking about? 

36:27.500 --> 36:29.700
Milos, nobody here is an agent.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.500
Okay.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.400
Then you leave melittle choice, huh?

36:35.100 --> 36:36.600
 I'll have to killboth of you.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.500
Which one of you would liketo die first?

36:38.600 --> 36:39.700
Nobody's got to die.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.600
We're all on the same side here. 

36:42.200 --> 36:44.100
Everybody just needs tocalm down.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.100
Lower your guns.

36:47.000 --> 36:47.800
Okay.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.200
Kill both of them.

37:07.500 --> 37:07.900
Enough!

37:09.600 --> 37:10.900
Outrigger,don't shoot kradic!

37:10.900 --> 37:12.400
We need him to lead usto the hydrosec.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.400
Let me finish this.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.800
Get on your knees.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.600
This is how you dealwith traitors.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.400
What you got to say now,agent dixon? 

37:41.600 --> 37:44.100
So, dixon, any last words?

37:44.500 --> 37:45.000
Hey...

37:46.300 --> 37:48.000
casualty of the businessI'm in. 

37:52.000 --> 37:52.900
He's giving usan out.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.700
He's sacrificing himselfto save the mission.

37:55.000 --> 37:55.500
Shoot him.

37:56.900 --> 37:57.200
do it

38:06.700 --> 38:10.500
We have business to do, and we needto get out of here before this guy'sbackup shows.

38:11.100 --> 38:11.900
You're welcome!

38:15.500 --> 38:16.000
 Let's go.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.400
This is agent vaughn, fieldcode alpha-5-0-niner-charlie.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.600
Request authorizationfor a code 4 medivac.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.400
We have an agent down. 

39:24.200 --> 39:25.200
Vaughn just reported in.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.400
Agent raimes is beingmedivaced to deventer.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.700
He's critical but stable.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.100
They're saying the shot didn'thit any of his vital organs

39:31.400 --> 39:32.400
Dixon saved his life.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.600
He just boarded the plane with kradic and his team.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.300
Re's the tail numberof his flight.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.600
All right, I'll put ina call to euro control, see if we can track it.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.900
I think I might be ableto triangulate dixon's signal using one of nsa'scomm sats.

39:42.900 --> 39:43.300
Just --

39:44.100 --> 39:45.600
excuse me, do you havea minute?

39:48.700 --> 39:49.400
What is this about? 

39:49.800 --> 39:50.600
Please, come in.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.100
There's something we needto tell you, something you havethe right to know.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.800
It concerns your mother's sister.

39:57.000 --> 39:57.700
Katya? 

39:58.000 --> 39:58.600
Yelena.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.700
She was one of the kgb'sforemost assassins,

40:03.500 --> 40:08.500
responsible for the murdersof countless diplomats and politiciansthroughout eastern europe.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.600
In the course of her work,she earned a reputation for being the cruelestof the derevko women.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.900
Why are you telling usthis now? 

40:16.100 --> 40:18.500
Because almost 30 years ago,yelena disappeared.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.700
It was rumored that she hada falling out with irina.

40:22.500 --> 40:25.700
Yelena severed all tiesthe kgb as well as her family.

40:26.400 --> 40:30.100
Both the cia and the kgbtried to find her, but to no avail.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.800
Even irina couldn't locate her.

40:31.800 --> 40:32.700
But you found something? 

40:32.900 --> 40:38.200
I received a messagefrom an old associate about a year agothat led me to one of yelena'ssafehouses in warsaw.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.500
Inside we found this.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.500
It's me in college.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.800
This is my old apartmentin argentina.

40:50.100 --> 40:51.900
My grad schooltranscripts. 

40:53.300 --> 40:54.400
I was 9 here.

40:55.200 --> 41:00.200
Given what's here,we can assume she's been surveilling you bothfor at least a decade.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.300
We can also assumethat she's responsible for the attack on sophia.

41:05.100 --> 41:05.800
Why?

41:06.100 --> 41:07.200
What does she wantfrom us?

41:07.700 --> 41:08.400
We don't know.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.800
We're doing everythingwe can to find out. 

41:13.900 --> 41:14.900
What did you learn?

41:16.400 --> 41:17.000
It's me.

41:18.000 --> 41:18.800
The plane is in the air.

41:18.800 --> 41:19.900
Do we know where they're headed?

41:20.800 --> 41:23.900
I'll contact you once I havetheir final destination.

41:24.700 --> 41:25.400
I'll be waiting.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.200
I won't let you down,yelena.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.400
Do you have any ideawhere yelena is now? 

41:32.700 --> 41:35.400
At this point,she could be anywhere. --
