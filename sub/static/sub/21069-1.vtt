PRODUCER HAN JAE-DUK

00:55.542 --> 00:57.167
<i>I can't stand people.</i>

00:59.626 --> 01:02.292
<i>Annam City, where I work as a cop,</i>

01:02.834 --> 01:05.334
<i>is bursting with rotten people.</i>

01:07.001 --> 01:08.916
<i>These days, with redevelopment coming,</i>

01:08.917 --> 01:11.209
<i>everyone's at each other's throats.</i>

01:13.167 --> 01:15.626
<i>Then there's Annam's mayor,
Park Sung-bae.</i>

01:16.667 --> 01:22.126
<i>He wants to eat up the city
all by himself.</i>

01:23.126 --> 01:25.917
<i>Of course his opponents
aren't going to stand still.</i>

01:26.251 --> 01:28.709
<i>Every day, it's nothing but war.</i>

01:30.459 --> 01:34.667
<i>As for me, I side with the winner.</i>

01:37.542 --> 01:40.376
<i>So our Mayor quietly gives me a call.</i>

01:41.751 --> 01:44.542
<i>He thinks of me as his gun dog.</i>

01:54.209 --> 01:57.667
It's not me... it really isn't.

01:58.334 --> 02:01.167
Then who is it? Your father?

02:03.626 --> 02:06.001
Hey, are you really a minor?

02:06.292 --> 02:08.334
A senior at Anpyung Girls High School.

02:09.751 --> 02:10.751
God damn!

02:10.834 --> 02:12.042
Hold this.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.376
Stand closer.

02:17.001 --> 02:18.001
Come on.

02:21.042 --> 02:22.833
It's ringing.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.501
Read from this.

02:26.042 --> 02:27.250
Hello, it's me.

02:27.251 --> 02:28.531
- Don't whimper.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

02:28.667 --> 02:34.042
I'm sorry, but I won't testify
in the appeals trial.

02:34.167 --> 02:37.417
The information I gave
to the Prosecutor before

02:37.792 --> 02:41.001
is all completely untrue.

02:41.042 --> 02:43.542
Tell the Prosecutor I'm so sorry!

02:43.834 --> 02:45.791
Wonderful. You were wonderful.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.334
I could kiss you.

02:49.126 --> 02:53.875
Mayor Park Sung-bae was
almost removed from office

02:53.876 --> 02:58.916
after being indicted last August
under the Public Official Election Law.

02:58.917 --> 03:03.833
But in today's appeal hearing,
the High Court ruled him innocent.

03:03.834 --> 03:07.208
Incidentally, the prosecution
secured a witness,

03:07.209 --> 03:10.583
but this morning he suddenly
canceled plans to testify.

03:10.584 --> 03:13.209
Let's hear from Mayor Park now.

03:16.001 --> 03:20.084
The ruling by the judiciary
comes as a great relief.

03:21.292 --> 03:25.750
But this attack from the
prosecution, with no witness...

03:25.751 --> 03:28.584
What kind of nonsense is that?

03:29.459 --> 03:36.541
This insults the honor and pride
of the 480,000 residents of Annam!

03:36.542 --> 03:38.626
He's right!

03:39.584 --> 03:41.209
Excuse me a moment.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.167
Going through.

03:43.959 --> 03:47.583
Prosecutor Oh, you gave a good effort.

03:47.584 --> 03:50.291
So do you know why the witness dropped out?

03:50.292 --> 03:54.375
No idea, maybe those lies
got to his conscience.

03:54.376 --> 03:58.042
He called out of the blue
and refused to testify.

04:01.501 --> 04:05.042
That's because you're
shitting on the rule of law.

04:06.042 --> 04:10.417
So you think you can serve out your term?

04:11.917 --> 04:15.417
Wow, the Prosecutor issues threats?

04:15.917 --> 04:18.000
I'll take care of my term.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.375
- That's enough!
- You damned prick!

04:22.292 --> 04:23.541
Sir, people are watching.

04:23.542 --> 04:24.834
Shut up!

04:25.667 --> 04:27.834
You target a popularly elected mayor?

04:31.917 --> 04:35.001
In this day and age, you
thugs show off your power?

04:35.084 --> 04:38.708
- Thugs?
- Sir, please let's go.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.292
Escort him out.

04:59.084 --> 05:02.876
It'll be lonely without you.

05:03.834 --> 05:06.459
You'll have to wear a suit every day.

05:07.876 --> 05:09.458
Won't it be uncomfortable?

05:09.459 --> 05:11.042
I'll give it a try.

05:15.251 --> 05:16.251
Hey, bro.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.876
In that case, go with a pearl grey suit.

05:23.001 --> 05:24.626
Go to sleep.

05:26.584 --> 05:27.917
Yes, sir.

05:41.292 --> 05:44.333
I said to call when the witness
lands in the Philippines.

05:44.334 --> 05:48.208
That fat pig was freaking
out, refusing to go.

05:48.209 --> 05:51.001
Had to force him on the plane.

05:51.126 --> 05:53.751
So, he arrived yesterday?

05:54.959 --> 05:58.208
He left today. I let the
drugs wear off first.

05:58.209 --> 05:59.501
Today?

06:00.667 --> 06:01.959
You changed the plan?

06:02.084 --> 06:06.542
I'll take care of it! You need to trust me.

06:20.126 --> 06:22.417
At attention! Stand straight.

06:22.876 --> 06:24.334
You think you're human?

06:28.001 --> 06:30.959
You're dog shit, know that?

06:31.792 --> 06:32.792
Yes, sir.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.167
Wipe your nose.

06:37.167 --> 06:44.042
You need to take care of
that witness, got it?

06:50.834 --> 06:52.958
What, you're going to count it?

06:52.959 --> 06:54.376
Oh, right.

06:56.626 --> 06:58.376
I said to wait outside.

06:59.001 --> 07:03.792
A guy about to quit goes on
a stakeout, I knew it then.

07:04.126 --> 07:05.625
What brings you here?

07:05.626 --> 07:09.709
Hey Junkie! You still
visit the Philippines?

07:09.959 --> 07:13.292
I stopped selling a year ago,
why should I go there?

07:13.376 --> 07:16.667
Don't glare at me, dickhead!

07:20.126 --> 07:24.209
Wait, Hwang! What's wrong?

07:24.292 --> 07:26.792
Is the Mayor doing well?

07:27.209 --> 07:28.459
What?

07:31.959 --> 07:36.417
You fucker, don't take it all for yourself.

07:37.084 --> 07:39.751
I know what's going on.

07:40.417 --> 07:43.001
What are you talking about?

07:44.167 --> 07:45.792
The witness.

07:46.376 --> 07:48.167
Didn't you and him take care of it?

07:52.251 --> 07:56.083
Isn't it illegal to cuff me
without saying that lawyer stuff?

07:56.084 --> 07:57.250
What did you say?

07:57.251 --> 07:59.667
Hwang, please.

08:00.042 --> 08:03.167
Just hear what I have to say.

08:04.001 --> 08:09.125
Look, if I bring him in,
you think I benefit?

08:09.126 --> 08:11.206
- Okay, I get you. So let's just uncuff him...
- Bro!

08:12.626 --> 08:14.626
Sergeant Hwang? Sir!

08:16.417 --> 08:17.417
What?

08:18.292 --> 08:19.667
What the hell?

08:19.834 --> 08:22.541
Hwang, wait a minute!

08:22.542 --> 08:23.376
I'll catch him!

08:23.377 --> 08:25.084
Hey Sun-mo!

08:32.251 --> 08:33.626
Hey Sun-mo!

08:34.917 --> 08:40.042
Why the fuck did he have to show up?

08:41.708 --> 08:44.207
We shouldn't touch that junkie, dammit!

08:44.208 --> 08:47.083
Shit, where is he hiding?

08:47.084 --> 08:48.084
Hey, Junkie!

08:52.334 --> 08:53.459
Junkie.

08:54.584 --> 08:56.126
I know you're out here.

09:01.626 --> 09:02.959
Look at you!

09:04.459 --> 09:08.250
What do you mean, what?
There's a cop after you.

09:08.251 --> 09:09.251
Be quiet.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.751
Fucking junkie.

09:15.709 --> 09:19.792
I'm over here! Call all the cops!

09:20.376 --> 09:22.292
Shut up, you.

09:24.917 --> 09:25.917
You got him?

09:25.918 --> 09:26.959
Sun-mo...

09:27.584 --> 09:28.459
What's his problem?

09:28.460 --> 09:31.001
This bastard took drugs!

09:31.251 --> 09:32.291
Shut up!

09:32.292 --> 09:33.292
Fuck off.

09:33.501 --> 09:35.166
Freeze!

09:35.167 --> 09:37.791
Sun-mo, why'd you draw that? Put it away.

09:37.792 --> 09:38.875
Don't move.

09:38.876 --> 09:40.333
Put it away, man.

09:40.334 --> 09:42.709
"Don't move. Don't move!"

09:43.251 --> 09:44.491
Sun-mo, I'll take care of this.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.000
That stupid nutcase!

09:47.001 --> 09:48.292
You're dead!

09:48.709 --> 09:50.001
Wait, Sun-mo!

09:53.084 --> 09:57.292
What a fucked up day.

10:09.251 --> 10:10.376
You asshole!

10:11.084 --> 10:16.167
One fucker gives me work,
and the other fucker chases me.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.459
Dickhead!

10:27.626 --> 10:29.751
Halt or I'll shoot, you fucker!

10:33.126 --> 10:37.292
Eat this. I know they're blank shells.

10:37.459 --> 10:41.709
These are live bullets.
One move and I'll really shoot!

10:42.376 --> 10:44.166
Hey, stop.

10:44.167 --> 10:47.292
Close the valve.

10:51.209 --> 10:52.876
Couldn't you come sooner?

10:56.209 --> 10:58.416
Hey, stop! Wait a second.

10:58.417 --> 11:00.916
- We should call 911.
- You got him?

11:00.917 --> 11:02.376
Let's have a look.

11:06.334 --> 11:08.458
Look at all this cash.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.542
Hwang!

11:10.084 --> 11:11.541
Let's talk this over.

11:11.542 --> 11:13.500
What's to talk about?

11:13.501 --> 11:16.209
Junkie is yours, and the
money's mine, right?

11:16.792 --> 11:19.458
Sun-mo, you want a cut?

11:19.459 --> 11:21.084
Forget it!

11:21.542 --> 11:23.251
Come on, Hwang...

11:28.417 --> 11:30.584
- Let go!
- Dammit!

11:32.876 --> 11:34.750
Goddamn it, you fucker!

11:34.751 --> 11:36.250
Why are you swearing at me?

11:36.251 --> 11:40.958
What, I can't swear at you?

11:40.959 --> 11:43.625
What the fuck did I do?

11:43.626 --> 11:46.959
Is telling you not to steal so wrong?

11:48.126 --> 11:53.751
You're always getting
a nice tip from the mayor.

11:55.334 --> 11:58.041
How many times did I beg you for a cut?

11:58.042 --> 12:01.000
Why can't I take that money?
You can and I can't?

12:01.001 --> 12:04.667
It's not your money. It's someone else's.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.625
- Then you stay out of it.
- God damn you!

12:07.626 --> 12:10.625
Sun-mo, don't shoot that.
I really need this.

12:10.626 --> 12:13.126
But we need to report it.

12:13.251 --> 12:15.292
Right, Han?

12:16.667 --> 12:18.001
You want to die?

12:19.584 --> 12:20.833
You think this is a joke?

12:20.834 --> 12:22.291
Have you gone mad?

12:22.292 --> 12:24.417
Let go, dammit!

12:24.876 --> 12:25.834
Why'd you hit him?

12:25.835 --> 12:27.834
You fucker!

12:40.626 --> 12:43.751
Will you fucking stop it?

12:50.709 --> 12:52.875
Fuck, stop it!

12:52.876 --> 12:55.542
Don't do it! Drop that!

12:56.709 --> 12:58.292
Stop, dammit!

13:17.709 --> 13:23.334
ASURA

13:26.209 --> 13:30.125
So you didn't know at first Sgt.
Hwang had arrived.

13:30.126 --> 13:34.376
But he told us he'd assist you.
I don't get that.

13:34.709 --> 13:36.750
I'm curious too, why he said that.

13:36.751 --> 13:41.458
It's not a detective's job,
bringing in violent criminals.

13:41.459 --> 13:44.750
It happened so fast. I had no choice.

13:44.751 --> 13:47.667
Let's go over it once more.

13:49.709 --> 13:50.709
Again?

13:51.001 --> 13:52.584
Last time, really.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.251
On the phone his speech was slow.

13:58.542 --> 14:02.751
He's on drugs, I thought.
He's dangerous when he's high.

14:03.251 --> 14:07.126
So I went out to grab him
before something happened.

14:33.417 --> 14:34.667
Where am I...?

14:38.501 --> 14:39.834
You killed a cop?

14:40.376 --> 14:43.834
You really killed a cop?

14:45.876 --> 14:49.751
You dirty fuck!

14:51.959 --> 14:54.084
Stop it, Han!

15:05.376 --> 15:08.459
This is Han. We have an emergency.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.876
Officer down. Send an ambulance quickly.

15:19.792 --> 15:22.876
You're under arrest for the
murder of a policeman.

15:23.334 --> 15:29.334
You have the right to remain silent,
and the right to a lawyer.

15:30.292 --> 15:33.751
However sudden, couldn't
three of you handle him?

15:34.292 --> 15:37.333
It's not my fault that the fence gave way.

15:37.334 --> 15:39.084
How far away were you?

15:39.417 --> 15:40.876
4-5 meters.

15:41.167 --> 15:42.541
That junkie pushed him so hard...

15:42.542 --> 15:45.251
Doesn't the junkie have a name, idiot?

15:45.709 --> 15:47.376
Who are you calling idiot?

15:47.584 --> 15:50.667
I told you to keep quiet!

15:55.501 --> 15:57.250
- Detective Han?
- Yes?

15:57.251 --> 15:59.334
We're done, you can go.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.584
Thank you.

16:03.292 --> 16:06.251
Why stare? Am I good looking?

16:08.042 --> 16:08.834
Yeah.

16:09.042 --> 16:10.917
You're quitting the police?

16:13.292 --> 16:14.376
Why?

16:14.876 --> 16:16.542
I felt like quitting.

16:16.917 --> 16:20.167
So why did you?

16:21.334 --> 16:23.792
Detective work doesn't suit me.

16:28.417 --> 16:32.083
Can't you tell me about
your business with Junkie?

16:32.084 --> 16:33.917
Let's eat.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.584
It's connected to Mayor Park?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.251
Let's just throw everything in the open!

16:47.709 --> 16:52.625
So you want me to go say,
"I killed him. I lied."

16:52.626 --> 16:54.376
I didn't mean it.

16:57.501 --> 16:59.542
Look me in the eye.

17:01.584 --> 17:02.708
I'm sorry.

17:02.709 --> 17:04.084
For what?

17:08.916 --> 17:11.416
What are you sorry for?

17:13.041 --> 17:15.541
I think I misunderstood.

17:15.584 --> 17:19.875
You definitely misunderstood.
I couldn't help it, okay?

17:19.876 --> 17:22.291
Was it my fault?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.291
- Was it yours?
- No.

17:28.209 --> 17:29.626
Let's eat.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.626
<i>Wrapping things up here isn't easy.</i>

17:35.626 --> 17:38.709
<i>But if I waver, I'll be in trouble.</i>

17:40.334 --> 17:42.709
<i>I need to start work for
the Mayor next week.</i>

17:44.001 --> 17:47.376
<i>I'm going to make a new start.</i>

18:04.584 --> 18:07.084
I'm still breathing.

18:12.209 --> 18:16.084
I downloaded some TV shows for you.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.376
Should I call a nurse?

18:24.001 --> 18:26.251
Park sent money again.

18:26.876 --> 18:28.251
How much?

18:28.959 --> 18:30.459
$20,000.

18:30.876 --> 18:33.001
He sent an extra $5,000.

18:34.251 --> 18:37.834
It's hard for you, accepting money?

18:40.792 --> 18:42.042
No...

18:43.834 --> 18:48.376
Oh, I gave $800 in condolence money, okay?

18:52.084 --> 18:56.834
I feel bad for Hwang's wife.

19:06.084 --> 19:08.167
You'll feel better now...

19:20.542 --> 19:22.291
I explained it all before.

19:22.292 --> 19:23.375
Not that, something else.

19:23.376 --> 19:25.792
What?

19:27.126 --> 19:29.208
I'll ask the questions.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.001
<i>Prosecutor's Office</i>

19:55.459 --> 19:57.125
Turn that off.

19:57.126 --> 19:58.250
Regulations require it.

19:58.251 --> 20:00.376
- Don't record me!
- We need to!

20:04.042 --> 20:08.084
You know the witness who was
gonna testify against the mayor?

20:08.459 --> 20:09.667
Who?

20:10.584 --> 20:14.208
The guy who skipped out
on court and disappeared!

20:14.209 --> 20:16.166
How would I know him?

20:16.167 --> 20:20.750
Because you kidnapped him
and forced him to call us.

20:20.751 --> 20:24.584
Now you're just slandering.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.875
Records indicate you met him four times.

20:30.876 --> 20:35.667
You drank together, went to
a motel and fucked girls...

20:36.834 --> 20:39.292
According to witness testimonies,

20:40.209 --> 20:44.376
he claimed to know a detective
from West Annam station.

20:45.792 --> 20:47.084
I've never seen him before.

20:48.459 --> 20:52.458
His body was found
in Malate in the Philippines.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.834
This morning.

20:54.001 --> 20:55.001
So?

20:56.084 --> 20:57.792
I'm late.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.209
You're hurting my eyes.

21:18.501 --> 21:20.334
Kim Cha-in, Gyeonggi District Prosecutor.

21:28.876 --> 21:30.501
You showed him the file.

21:31.626 --> 21:35.709
And the airport parking lot photo?
That's the highlight.

21:37.584 --> 21:41.334
The witness being led by Junkie.
Your informant.

21:42.417 --> 21:45.917
That night, he was beaten
by you and arrested.

21:47.542 --> 21:51.125
Good, he's the jerk who
killed our Sergeant.

21:51.126 --> 21:53.000
I want to skin him alive.

21:53.001 --> 21:57.417
You're famous for being sly. You act well.

21:58.501 --> 22:02.916
Threatening an honest policeman
like this with no evidence...

22:02.917 --> 22:07.417
I heard you're quitting
to join the Mayor's team officially?

22:10.292 --> 22:13.083
I'm not sure yet. Someone just suggested.

22:13.084 --> 22:15.501
Are you gonna keep lying?

22:16.084 --> 22:20.250
Official records show you
met the Mayor 22 times.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.376
This is your resignation letter?

22:23.126 --> 22:25.625
Processing is delayed due to Hwang's case.

22:25.626 --> 22:26.876
I'll take care of this for you.

22:27.126 --> 22:27.834
What?

22:27.835 --> 22:31.626
I'll take care of it. Understand?

22:31.959 --> 22:35.001
Wouldn't that be handled by the higher-ups?

22:36.042 --> 22:38.501
I'm higher than the higher-ups.

22:51.126 --> 22:52.292
Coffee...

22:53.417 --> 22:54.834
Holy shit.

23:08.126 --> 23:09.751
Don't glare at me.

23:11.542 --> 23:12.334
Don't glare.

23:12.335 --> 23:13.792
Son of a bitch!

23:14.001 --> 23:17.708
Don't glare, little shit.

23:17.709 --> 23:18.584
Don't.

23:18.584 --> 23:19.542
Glare.

23:19.543 --> 23:21.959
Do. Not. Fucking. Glare.

23:22.876 --> 23:24.792
You asshole!

23:25.376 --> 23:27.251
Let go of me, fuck!

23:28.792 --> 23:33.001
I'll show you, fucker! Let go of me!

23:33.084 --> 23:37.084
Okay, let's just remember two things.

23:39.584 --> 23:46.000
First, you have no time.
Your life ends on Nov. 20th.

23:46.001 --> 23:48.167
Second... Let him go!

23:48.917 --> 23:51.750
Before then, bring me recorded proof

23:51.751 --> 23:55.208
that Park ordered the kidnapping.

23:55.209 --> 23:57.417
Sit him upright.

24:03.917 --> 24:10.167
You committed all those crimes
for Park's sake, but...

24:10.376 --> 24:13.791
even if he slips free, you never will.
You know why?

24:13.792 --> 24:17.042
Because you took on all
the dirty work yourself.

24:18.042 --> 24:22.126
If we investigate, you'll spend
at least 3 years in jail.

24:22.959 --> 24:25.667
I'm really good at that.

24:30.709 --> 24:35.709
Why are we wasting the land
vacated by the US Army?

24:36.292 --> 24:38.875
A citizen wrote on the city website,

24:38.876 --> 24:42.916
"Annam's development is blocked
by the Development Committee!"

24:42.917 --> 24:44.791
and it got 500 replies!

24:44.792 --> 24:45.584
Wait a minute!

24:45.585 --> 24:50.083
What a relief that the Committee
will disband this month!

24:50.084 --> 24:51.626
Mr. Mayor!

24:52.042 --> 24:55.458
If only you are going to talk,
why did you call us here?

24:55.459 --> 24:58.375
He has the floor, wait for your turn.

24:58.376 --> 25:02.041
From the beginning we
agreed to a business plan

25:02.042 --> 25:05.708
but who pushed for the plan to be canceled?

25:05.709 --> 25:08.500
After we spent 8 years on the development,

25:08.501 --> 25:10.917
who overturned it in a single day?

25:11.209 --> 25:14.501
Deputy Chairman, may I ask a question too?

25:15.334 --> 25:20.376
Honestly, weren't those 8 years
just a power grab for you?

25:21.376 --> 25:24.001
I want a formal retraction
of that statement!

25:26.167 --> 25:28.083
Stop all this!

25:28.084 --> 25:30.625
Let's just go. Noting more worth hearing.

25:30.626 --> 25:33.584
This bread tastes like shit.

25:38.876 --> 25:41.958
I don't get why you try so hard

25:41.959 --> 25:45.876
to get rid of a hardworking
mayor doing his job.

25:46.459 --> 25:49.792
Mr. Mayor, I didn't expect
you to be so crass.

25:50.209 --> 25:54.209
You won't give up on this
New Town development!

25:54.626 --> 25:58.583
We should invite the US Army back.
Don't listen to that jerk!

25:58.584 --> 26:01.041
"That jerk?" Did you just say that?

26:01.042 --> 26:05.209
At an official meeting, you
should speak with respect!

26:19.167 --> 26:23.959
You all sound so scary,
I went and peed my pants!

26:37.917 --> 26:39.459
Don't want to work with me?

26:40.126 --> 26:42.417
You know how much I want it.

26:43.042 --> 26:45.000
I said I'd quit at once.

26:45.001 --> 26:48.208
They said I can't leave
with Hwang's case unsolved.

26:48.209 --> 26:51.042
So I said okay, I'll finish it, then quit.

27:00.167 --> 27:01.792
What's really going on?

27:04.542 --> 27:06.209
That's everything.

27:07.251 --> 27:11.001
It's making me crazy too, this mess.

27:17.709 --> 27:23.583
I like you one minute,
then hate you the next...

27:23.584 --> 27:24.667
I wonder why?

27:26.917 --> 27:32.834
Things are already in motion.
If you don't do it, who will?

27:34.376 --> 27:37.000
I've been worried about that too.

27:37.001 --> 27:38.501
How's Junkie?

27:40.376 --> 27:43.959
I heard he regained
consciousness yesterday.

27:44.917 --> 27:47.542
Don't make things complicated.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.376
It's not like you.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.459
I'll do my best.

27:53.709 --> 27:55.167
Mr. Mayor.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.917
Secretary Eun! Let me look.

28:00.376 --> 28:05.459
It's still wet in the crotch.
Dry it some more.

28:07.876 --> 28:12.459
Hey, how was that joke I
made in front of everyone?

28:13.834 --> 28:17.333
Your humor had everyone in stitches!

28:17.334 --> 28:20.334
What do you mean? It wasn't everyone!

28:20.667 --> 28:22.667
- Really?
- Sure.

28:26.334 --> 28:29.251
God, that guy just won't listen.

28:30.709 --> 28:35.833
Han! Are you really going to
throw Junkie to the dogs?

28:35.834 --> 28:39.584
This isn't because he shot up.
He killed a cop.

28:40.001 --> 28:43.916
But why pull him into
this from the beginning?

28:43.917 --> 28:45.334
Didn't you come to see me?

28:46.834 --> 28:48.001
Yes.

28:51.959 --> 28:53.875
I told you we can't meet like this.

28:53.876 --> 28:57.291
You and I are enemies!

28:57.292 --> 28:58.708
I know.

28:58.709 --> 29:01.833
But after today, I think
I can quit this charade.

29:01.834 --> 29:05.709
What do you mean, quit? I need you there.

29:06.042 --> 29:11.166
Those scumbags want to backstab me
and eat up that $800 million deal.

29:11.167 --> 29:17.459
I think they figured me out,
we'll just expose our hand.

29:17.751 --> 29:21.375
Then later if I get the
construction contract,

29:21.376 --> 29:23.584
I'll be lynched from both sides.

29:24.001 --> 29:25.917
You have no trust.

29:27.042 --> 29:29.584
That makes it harder for me.

29:31.501 --> 29:35.792
I heard the opposing camp
is bringing in Prosecutor Oh.

29:36.126 --> 29:39.750
Shouldn't we do something
to the Supreme Prosecutor?

29:39.751 --> 29:41.416
That's what I want too!

29:41.417 --> 29:45.125
With $20 million I could
stick it to them now!

29:45.126 --> 29:47.625
But you say you're out of cash!

29:47.626 --> 29:50.917
God, you drive me crazy!
Talking money again!

29:51.376 --> 29:53.416
I'm out of cash, really!

29:53.417 --> 29:55.458
You know how much you spent this year?

29:55.459 --> 29:58.667
Fuck, you're annoying!

29:58.917 --> 30:03.083
So, build in just one district?
How many times should I say it?

30:03.084 --> 30:05.875
For a large-scale zone we need to hold out

30:05.876 --> 30:09.626
for approval in all four
districts, you stupid!

30:18.334 --> 30:24.417
I mean, if the municipality
objects, we can't build at all.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.208
You're just talking tough
after winning the appeal.

30:27.209 --> 30:30.376
You're not being reasonable!

30:32.876 --> 30:39.084
You need push and pull.

30:39.709 --> 30:43.084
You know nothing about politics.

30:45.417 --> 30:47.376
I'm not backing out.

30:48.084 --> 30:50.583
But the rumors about the
Mayor really scare me.

30:50.584 --> 30:52.500
Don't believe rumors.

30:52.501 --> 30:55.791
If he takes you in,
you know how generous he is?

30:55.792 --> 30:58.834
What's your take-home pay? $2,200 a month?

30:59.459 --> 31:02.000
Base pay's $4,000. Bonuses extra!

31:02.001 --> 31:04.916
Money money money!

31:04.917 --> 31:08.333
I'm not doing it for the money.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.041
I'm just trusting your advice, 100%.

31:11.042 --> 31:14.626
You always talk like that.

31:16.167 --> 31:19.167
Still, you're thankful, right?

31:21.126 --> 31:22.542
You fucker!

31:24.251 --> 31:26.626
"Very very thank you," for sure.

31:44.167 --> 31:45.459
What is it?

31:46.292 --> 31:49.001
<i>You withdrew your resignation.</i>

31:49.376 --> 31:52.001
<i>Got yourself posted to External Affairs?</i>

31:52.459 --> 31:54.626
Just tell me your conditions.

31:55.334 --> 32:00.042
<i>Our office is in a quiet place.
Join us from tomorrow.</i>

32:00.959 --> 32:03.792
God, you ask a lot.

32:04.501 --> 32:06.541
<i>Come and work hard.</i>

32:06.542 --> 32:09.959
<i>I'm impatient, we want the Mayor now.</i>

32:10.542 --> 32:12.792
<i>Not long to Nov. 20th.</i>

32:13.542 --> 32:16.626
<i>To stay out of jail,
record something for us.</i>

32:17.626 --> 32:19.126
Yes, sure...

32:28.542 --> 32:29.834
Over here.

32:30.792 --> 32:34.001
Everyone thought the Mayor would lose.

32:34.626 --> 32:38.375
But after he ended up being re-elected,

32:38.376 --> 32:41.334
he tried taking the development
rights for himself,

32:41.751 --> 32:44.667
so the opposition closed ranks.

32:45.001 --> 32:48.708
The problem is that Tae Byung-jo
is on the opposite side.

32:48.709 --> 32:52.251
Park has been funded by Tae's dirty money.

32:52.459 --> 32:54.709
Maybe they're putting on a show?

32:56.167 --> 32:59.167
That guy there should know.

33:00.626 --> 33:04.084
What scheme are Park and Tae concocting?

33:07.042 --> 33:12.209
Be straight with him. He knows
you retracted your resignation.

33:13.542 --> 33:14.959
Did you record it?

33:18.542 --> 33:19.459
Why not?

33:19.460 --> 33:21.959
I was never ordered to kidnap the witness.

33:24.751 --> 33:27.959
Let's start working this bitch over.

33:39.876 --> 33:44.876
So your bright idea is to
send Moon Sun-mo in your place?

33:45.292 --> 33:48.126
He said he wants to go, what can I do?

33:51.917 --> 33:58.876
You're giving it quite the
effort in your cramped car.

34:11.876 --> 34:13.626
Okay, let's spill the beans.

34:14.126 --> 34:17.416
Your illegal investigation into the Mayor,

34:17.417 --> 34:21.167
I'll spread it all over
the internet and on TV.

34:23.001 --> 34:24.250
Don't get excited. Sit.

34:24.251 --> 34:28.291
You have no idea how much of a prick I am.

34:28.292 --> 34:29.666
Please sit down!

34:29.667 --> 34:33.292
I'll take this to the fucking end.
I don't lie.

34:33.501 --> 34:41.001
Your wife's number is
010... 3348... 4982... right?

34:42.126 --> 34:43.208
Shall I send it?

34:43.376 --> 34:44.376
Don't.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.501
What? I didn't hear you. What did you say?

34:49.376 --> 34:50.583
Please don't.

34:51.042 --> 34:52.708
Why shouldn't I?

34:52.708 --> 34:55.292
She's on her deathbed, dammit!

34:56.251 --> 35:02.709
So a guy like you, with a
sick wife, fucks around?

35:05.167 --> 35:06.417
Oh my.

35:08.334 --> 35:14.416
As an apology to your wife,
why don't you push 'send' yourself?

35:14.417 --> 35:18.166
- Why are you doing this?
- Push it! Push it.

35:18.167 --> 35:19.376
Go ahead.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.334
Push 'send'!

35:22.126 --> 35:23.417
Push it.

35:24.126 --> 35:24.959
Push it!

35:24.960 --> 35:28.458
- Please, Prosecutor!
- Push it! Push it!

35:28.459 --> 35:29.459
Push it!

35:29.959 --> 35:31.292
Push it!

35:31.501 --> 35:32.876
Push it!

35:32.959 --> 35:34.625
- Fucking hell!
- Push it!

35:34.626 --> 35:37.292
Push it!

35:48.292 --> 35:51.417
Come on, tough guy.

35:55.834 --> 35:57.584
I'll record it for sure.

36:05.167 --> 36:05.834
Record what?

36:05.835 --> 36:09.126
The Mayor ordering the kidnapping.

36:10.042 --> 36:15.333
Might be faster to book him and
Tae under organized crime laws.

36:15.334 --> 36:17.708
We'd need to link him to Tae.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.666
To trace their finances, we'd
need the court's approval.

36:21.667 --> 36:22.667
He won't sit still.

36:22.668 --> 36:24.834
Intelligence gathering
is one level above us.

36:26.709 --> 36:29.751
You might be giving him too much there.

36:30.126 --> 36:31.376
He sure can drink.

36:34.126 --> 36:35.500
Okay if I pour you one?

36:35.501 --> 36:36.626
Yes.

36:37.209 --> 36:39.666
Sir, can I ask a question?

36:39.667 --> 36:41.751
Sure, go ahead and ask.

36:43.542 --> 36:47.584
They say Park's opposition
has brought in Prosecutor Oh...

36:48.334 --> 36:50.834
Then are you his lapdog?

36:55.209 --> 36:56.459
Lapdog?

36:57.876 --> 37:00.333
Those are just rumors.

37:00.334 --> 37:04.375
You call that a question, you bitch?

37:04.376 --> 37:07.626
He told me to ask, you dickhead.

37:11.709 --> 37:12.709
Step outside.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.500
- Get out here!
- Sure!

37:15.501 --> 37:19.751
Both of you sit down.
Hey, control yourself.

37:21.584 --> 37:22.792
Detective Han!

37:23.167 --> 37:27.584
Detectives control themselves in
order to solve crimes. Us too.

37:27.751 --> 37:31.166
Let's respect and trust each other, okay?

37:31.167 --> 37:33.251
So fucking pretentious.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.000
You want to die?

37:35.001 --> 37:40.125
If you weren't a prosecutor,
I'd beat you dead!

37:40.126 --> 37:41.291
Calm down!

37:41.292 --> 37:42.959
Fuck!

37:45.126 --> 37:49.958
Detective Han, I like your spirit!
You're a tough one!

37:49.959 --> 37:52.791
Kiss my fat ass!

37:52.792 --> 37:54.709
Shut the fuck up!

37:57.001 --> 37:58.459
Shall I help you?

37:58.834 --> 38:00.084
I'm fine.

38:00.459 --> 38:01.959
Bruised again?

38:03.042 --> 38:04.375
Be more careful.

38:04.376 --> 38:08.042
Still popular with the ladies!

38:10.084 --> 38:11.708
He'll be up in 5 minutes.

38:11.709 --> 38:13.375
Is this that damned pearl grey?

38:13.376 --> 38:16.251
Who wears silver these days?

38:16.876 --> 38:20.625
Giorgio Armani... on sale!

38:20.626 --> 38:23.375
Look at these lines, here and here.

38:23.376 --> 38:25.042
It's tough working for him, right?

38:25.626 --> 38:29.501
He squeezes blood from a stone, he's crazy!

38:30.792 --> 38:33.626
But I really love working here.

38:33.834 --> 38:36.626
I always hated politicians,

38:37.459 --> 38:40.750
but seeing them up close, they're amazing.

38:40.751 --> 38:42.875
The way they go at each other, wow...

38:42.876 --> 38:44.541
He gives you extra on the side?

38:44.542 --> 38:50.084
I couldn't believe it!
I'm gonna buy a Beamer 520.

38:52.542 --> 38:55.167
Why didn't you move her here earlier?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.251
She refused, but I moved her anyway.

39:00.876 --> 39:02.917
Wash her up, she smells!

39:04.459 --> 39:06.459
Oh, my...

39:07.542 --> 39:08.667
What's with the bruise?

39:10.042 --> 39:11.626
Why don't you lie down?

39:15.459 --> 39:18.334
Ah, that's nice!

39:20.042 --> 39:22.834
That prosecutor, was it Kim Cha-in?

39:23.042 --> 39:27.501
Studied law at a provincial school,
not even a southern guy.

39:28.042 --> 39:30.209
It wouldn't be hard to squash him.

39:32.042 --> 39:34.834
You mean the special prosecutor?

39:40.751 --> 39:48.376
Our friend Tae's got so much
dirty laundry, he's vulnerable.

39:49.501 --> 39:52.876
That's why I said to keep
your distance from Tae.

39:54.084 --> 39:58.666
Still, he's been my guard
dog for over a decade.

39:58.667 --> 40:03.459
Let's not think of the bad
stuff, is my attitude.

40:03.709 --> 40:06.251
But you have to put him aside.

40:14.834 --> 40:17.709
I don't like you advising me.

40:18.459 --> 40:21.251
It sounds like you're ordering me.

40:29.042 --> 40:35.542
I was only thinking things over
from your perspective.

40:35.626 --> 40:42.333
People generally don't think
from other perspectives.

40:42.334 --> 40:45.126
They just think of themselves.

40:47.292 --> 40:49.959
- Except for you.
- Yes, sure.

40:51.709 --> 40:53.416
I'll call you later.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.792
Oh ma'am, just a minute.

40:59.042 --> 41:01.626
I'm sorry. I was in the restroom.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.501
Hey, give him the phone.

41:06.209 --> 41:09.667
It's registered in the
name of some old farmer.

41:09.876 --> 41:13.125
It's only for calls with
you, me and Secretary Eun.

41:13.126 --> 41:15.916
- From now on, use that.
- Yes.

41:15.917 --> 41:17.292
Four, including me!

41:22.126 --> 41:24.667
I heard you're like brothers?

41:25.042 --> 41:26.209
- Yes.
- Yes.

41:27.417 --> 41:32.251
Brothers are all about honor.

41:33.709 --> 41:34.792
Yes.

41:36.501 --> 41:40.084
If I tell you to relax,
and you actually do it,

41:40.876 --> 41:44.333
how far will you go in life?

41:44.334 --> 41:45.334
I'm sorry, sir!

41:50.042 --> 41:51.042
I'll do better!

41:59.084 --> 42:01.251
This kid's cute.

42:02.751 --> 42:04.042
- Let's go.
- Yes.

42:10.876 --> 42:13.334
Take good care of her.

42:19.167 --> 42:21.126
Not sure she can drink this.

42:21.626 --> 42:22.917
Thank you.

42:29.334 --> 42:30.751
Han,

42:30.959 --> 42:32.501
should I kill that gangster?

42:37.292 --> 42:38.542
Mr. Tae?

42:40.917 --> 42:42.251
Will you do it?

42:45.001 --> 42:46.584
What, you refuse?

42:51.292 --> 42:56.042
You coward... I'm joking.

43:06.542 --> 43:10.959
<i>Voice Recording 001</i>

43:21.167 --> 43:23.542
<i>Delete File?</i>

43:29.667 --> 43:32.375
Want a mini recorder to
put on your clothes?

43:32.376 --> 43:33.833
I'll take care of it, dammit!

43:33.834 --> 43:36.501
Leave him alone. Remember his temper.

43:37.626 --> 43:39.626
- Want to share my rice?
- Why?

43:40.292 --> 43:41.500
You look pitiful.

43:41.501 --> 43:42.501
Got a crush on me?

43:42.502 --> 43:45.126
Fuck, no. You're the worst type.

43:46.542 --> 43:48.042
You ordered Chinese?

43:50.709 --> 43:52.334
Guess you were hungry.

43:54.376 --> 43:59.501
So you let the neighborhood know
about our secret base, idiots!

44:01.292 --> 44:03.834
We wanted to save time...

44:05.459 --> 44:09.376
Mr. Han! So your wife
is Park's half-sister?

44:10.376 --> 44:11.709
Brothers-in-law!

44:14.709 --> 44:17.501
You spoke with him at the hospital, right?

44:24.459 --> 44:26.740
He said nothing about the
witness, so how can I record it?

44:26.834 --> 44:30.376
So you have to ask him, bitch!

44:32.292 --> 44:33.542
Quiet, everyone!

44:34.792 --> 44:37.667
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

44:39.917 --> 44:41.042
What?

44:41.834 --> 44:43.126
He says to clear out.

44:43.542 --> 44:44.584
What?

44:45.501 --> 44:47.751
We're going back to the
headquarters for now.

44:48.084 --> 44:50.500
Wasn't that Prosecutor Oh?

44:50.501 --> 44:52.084
He's getting pressured from above.

44:53.292 --> 44:54.750
Fuck, you're dead!

44:54.751 --> 44:56.417
Not from there.

45:00.917 --> 45:07.417
Our dear Mayor, Han's brother-in-law,
shook higher up the tree.

45:08.584 --> 45:12.334
It's for the best. We'll get some rest.

45:12.792 --> 45:14.042
Let's pack up!

45:14.626 --> 45:18.167
Pack up!

45:18.459 --> 45:20.334
Pack up!

45:20.959 --> 45:22.251
Pack up!

45:27.209 --> 45:29.376
My husband won't let me see the bankbook.

45:29.834 --> 45:33.250
It doesn't matter, just circle #1.

45:33.251 --> 45:36.334
Wow, lucky Han!

45:36.542 --> 45:39.876
Rubbing shoulders at work
with pretty women...

45:40.084 --> 45:43.500
Yeah, I love it here. What brings you?

45:43.501 --> 45:45.584
Something awkward's come up.

45:46.709 --> 45:49.751
That bastard Junkie just
retracted his testimony.

45:52.584 --> 45:58.459
I said I didn't kill him! I didn't even
know Sgt. Hwang died! How'd he die?

45:59.209 --> 46:01.500
Diabetes? Cirrhosis?

46:01.501 --> 46:03.959
We saw you push him.

46:05.667 --> 46:08.958
You rehearsed your story with Sun-mo?

46:08.959 --> 46:10.876
Are you making shit up?

46:12.417 --> 46:15.292
Looks like you're the one making shit up.

46:17.001 --> 46:19.751
Should I tell them about
the fruit warehouse?

46:25.334 --> 46:29.542
Just like a druggie to
start making shit up.

46:30.459 --> 46:33.876
Your voice is shaking, Detective.

46:38.417 --> 46:39.667
What the hell's he doing?

46:41.292 --> 46:42.459
That bastard!

46:45.251 --> 46:46.834
Come here, You asshole!

46:48.542 --> 46:49.542
Fuck!

46:55.001 --> 46:56.751
Calm down!

46:57.042 --> 46:59.209
Get down, you bastard!

47:01.126 --> 47:02.208
Calm down. Whoa.

47:02.209 --> 47:04.126
Han, why are you so worked up?

47:04.459 --> 47:06.334
You didn't do anything wrong.

47:11.959 --> 47:15.751
We should've had blowfish.
Thought you hated $5 meals?

47:15.959 --> 47:17.542
Why'd you do that back there?

47:17.917 --> 47:19.375
I told you not to show me up.

47:19.376 --> 47:22.083
Who would believe a drug dealer?

47:22.084 --> 47:25.042
You've really lost your balls recently.

47:25.126 --> 47:27.709
Fucking bastard!

47:28.667 --> 47:31.376
Why are you swearing?

47:34.501 --> 47:35.501
Sun-mo!

47:36.626 --> 47:39.167
What did I tell you to do to survive?

47:39.501 --> 47:42.459
"Know your place, and
never cross the line."

47:42.667 --> 47:44.292
"To stop at the line!"

47:44.667 --> 47:48.709
I'll take care of my own business, okay?

47:49.292 --> 47:50.666
- Sit.
- I need to go.

47:50.667 --> 47:52.000
I said sit!

47:52.001 --> 47:54.251
The Mayor told you to come tomorrow.

48:02.667 --> 48:07.667
Poor folks from across the country
gathered there to earn money.

48:08.042 --> 48:11.376
At first they were 5 minutes
from being a dog's dinner.

48:11.667 --> 48:13.458
But in the 1980s Bundang...

48:13.459 --> 48:14.666
<i>Annam, the 2nd Bundang</i>

48:14.667 --> 48:18.876
was named a New City development, and now?

48:20.292 --> 48:21.541
How are they doing now?

48:21.542 --> 48:25.917
Now, it's "Bundang Above Heaven!"

48:27.459 --> 48:30.875
Wait and see what becomes of our Annam.

48:30.876 --> 48:34.625
A rich city that'll pull in
all the nation's millionaires!

48:34.626 --> 48:36.959
- What kind of city?
- Rich city!

48:37.042 --> 48:40.626
- I don't hear you, what city?
- Rich city!

48:41.167 --> 48:46.334
I, Park Sung-bae, with these
hands, will build it!

48:53.792 --> 48:56.292
You're saving for a car? Add that.

48:58.042 --> 48:59.750
Did I offend you yesterday?

48:59.751 --> 49:01.959
No, I like getting treated, asshole.

49:04.001 --> 49:06.042
Don't smirk. Put it in your wallet.

49:06.501 --> 49:07.501
Yes, sir.

49:08.876 --> 49:11.833
These days I regret making
you quit the force.

49:11.834 --> 49:15.001
Why? I didn't quit because of you.

49:21.167 --> 49:22.626
Kiss my fat ass.

49:25.667 --> 49:27.834
Let's have a look at the Annam Metropolis!

49:28.501 --> 49:30.334
The Annam Metropolis!

49:36.417 --> 49:38.209
<i>Annam Metropolis</i>

49:38.667 --> 49:40.292
It's beautiful!

49:42.417 --> 49:43.917
Everybody get ready.

49:44.084 --> 49:46.626
So what's today's event?

49:47.751 --> 49:49.626
Mr. Tae's thugs are going to cause a scene.

49:49.917 --> 49:52.667
- Why didn't you say earlier?
- When could I?

49:53.501 --> 49:54.959
I need to go.

49:56.084 --> 49:58.251
Tell me quickly, so I can help out.

49:58.292 --> 50:01.001
I can't tell you. You
know the Mayor's rules.

50:01.376 --> 50:03.251
"Tell the fewest men possible!"

50:14.417 --> 50:15.417
Reporter Kim!

50:20.376 --> 50:22.126
I don't like that camera.

50:22.209 --> 50:24.750
- Hey, turn the cameras off!
- Stop what you're doing.

50:24.751 --> 50:27.042
I said turn the cameras off!

50:27.251 --> 50:29.666
All of our men, stop now!

50:29.667 --> 50:32.334
- Why don't you clear this up?
- Gather here, everyone.

50:32.626 --> 50:35.876
What are they doing? Why'd they stop?

50:38.709 --> 50:40.292
Tell them to start.

50:42.126 --> 50:43.876
Lose the camera.

50:46.542 --> 50:49.125
Sir, he says to hurry up.

50:49.126 --> 50:54.292
Your Mayor. Why's he
always trying to bury me?

50:54.626 --> 50:57.751
Looks like he wants this
on the evening news.

50:58.459 --> 51:00.709
Would you do it with these cameras?

51:06.501 --> 51:09.709
Still, please do it.

51:10.084 --> 51:12.167
Look at this crazy punk!

51:14.001 --> 51:18.209
Goddamned chicken shit!

51:19.292 --> 51:21.333
Why don't you do it, dickhead?

51:21.334 --> 51:22.417
Give me the box-cutter.

51:23.917 --> 51:27.209
You try it. You'll be good at it.

51:27.584 --> 51:28.584
Sir!

51:30.417 --> 51:31.709
Don't touch me.

51:35.792 --> 51:37.709
Please do as you promised.

51:37.751 --> 51:43.584
Han, I'm not gonna follow that
lunatic's orders anymore.

51:45.751 --> 51:47.126
Let's go!

51:47.876 --> 51:50.583
Wait, Mister! You there!

51:50.584 --> 51:52.125
What's the meaning of this?

51:52.126 --> 51:53.001
Mr. Mayor!

51:53.002 --> 51:55.834
It's okay, let go of me! Let go!

51:56.417 --> 51:59.126
How can you cause such a scene?

52:02.251 --> 52:03.251
Hey, Tae!

52:06.292 --> 52:07.626
You can't go like this!

52:12.542 --> 52:13.834
Stop fighting!

52:15.626 --> 52:18.376
Don't fight! You shouldn't fight!

52:26.167 --> 52:27.167
Don't fight!

52:27.751 --> 52:28.834
Let go, you idiot!

52:32.876 --> 52:34.126
Please don't fight!

52:36.917 --> 52:38.376
Please stop fighting!

52:57.834 --> 52:59.376
Don't let them see it.

53:05.834 --> 53:06.917
Mr. Mayor!

53:07.584 --> 53:08.750
Mr. Mayor!

53:08.751 --> 53:10.333
Out of the way!

53:10.334 --> 53:11.584
Nobody touch the Mayor!

53:11.917 --> 53:13.209
Cameras!

53:17.334 --> 53:18.709
This person did it!

53:19.584 --> 53:22.417
That person! He's the assailant!

53:23.376 --> 53:24.417
I'm okay!

53:24.667 --> 53:29.709
I, Park Sung-bae, will stand
with you to the end!

53:31.959 --> 53:41.042
Park Sung-bae! Park Sung-bae!

53:41.292 --> 53:43.583
<i>Terror Attack on Mayor Park</i>
Are we just going to stand by and watch?

53:43.584 --> 53:45.666
Who would want that?

53:45.667 --> 53:47.917
We need some kind of response.

53:48.126 --> 53:49.333
Someone didn't do his job.

53:49.334 --> 53:51.167
The local districts are in an uproar.

53:57.876 --> 54:00.001
You knew they were staging a show.

54:01.292 --> 54:02.542
I'm sorry.

54:05.292 --> 54:07.459
I told you to get him by Nov. 20th.

54:07.876 --> 54:11.042
You should step aside, as you promised.

54:15.459 --> 54:19.167
Mr. Oh, please give me a little more time.

54:21.417 --> 54:24.042
I'll lock him up for sure!

54:24.709 --> 54:26.376
Oh my...

54:40.001 --> 54:43.876
I can't aim for shit.

54:53.834 --> 54:55.334
What are you sulking about?

54:56.917 --> 54:59.751
I'm one of the team, but
only I didn't know.

55:05.417 --> 55:08.376
If everyone knows, it's
entertainment, not politics.

55:09.376 --> 55:11.126
No, my ears hurt.

55:30.459 --> 55:31.376
What the hell?

55:31.377 --> 55:33.084
That's all 50 bullets.

55:34.417 --> 55:36.584
I blew off some steam, anyway.

55:38.167 --> 55:41.501
Secretary Eun, so I'm
on YTN News' main page?

55:41.667 --> 55:45.001
"Braver than the US Ambassador
During his Attack."

55:46.626 --> 55:47.750
Who? Me?

55:47.751 --> 55:49.251
The press is going crazy!

55:50.042 --> 55:51.251
Shall we look?

55:57.834 --> 56:00.751
Han did a good job at that moment.

56:01.417 --> 56:02.791
Not at all.

56:02.792 --> 56:04.541
It's because Sun-mo backed me up.

56:04.542 --> 56:06.501
Compared to you,

56:07.126 --> 56:08.709
he's got a long way to go.

56:10.084 --> 56:12.209
Mr. Tae will arrive soon.

56:13.167 --> 56:15.083
- <i>Mayor Park's popularity is</i>
- Might be best...

56:15.084 --> 56:17.268
- <i>growing after the box-cutter attack...</i>
- not to provoke Tae for a while.

56:17.292 --> 56:19.376
- The prosecutors...
- Han!

56:26.126 --> 56:30.209
I'm easily scared. Don't scare me more.

56:30.501 --> 56:33.291
You shouldn't give the
prosecutors any foothold.

56:33.292 --> 56:34.959
Junkie is spilling the beans?

56:35.209 --> 56:39.458
Seems he admitted taking
the witness to the airport.

56:39.459 --> 56:43.167
Junkie can't say anything.
He took part in a murder...

56:45.126 --> 56:47.459
Don't pretend to be innocent.

56:48.626 --> 56:53.751
Heard you and Junkie had
a big fight over the Hwang case.

56:57.126 --> 57:01.334
Sir, a text message about the carrier.

57:04.417 --> 57:06.666
So the fruit boxes are ready?

57:06.667 --> 57:09.751
Yes, I packed them myself.

57:09.876 --> 57:11.417
So, the Chinese gangsters...

57:12.209 --> 57:14.251
Hey cop, wait outside.

57:16.167 --> 57:17.876
I said get out.

57:20.542 --> 57:23.958
But there are so many eyes in Minpyung.

57:23.959 --> 57:27.626
Deliver it by tomorrow night.

57:33.084 --> 57:35.251
My god...

57:36.167 --> 57:39.541
I told you to come alone!

57:39.542 --> 57:43.459
An old habit. Hey, you wait here.

58:06.042 --> 58:09.833
The citizens group said that you quit.

58:09.834 --> 58:14.167
Oh my, why are you so reproachful?

58:14.542 --> 58:18.209
I just briefly lost my temper,

58:18.542 --> 58:20.666
but I've had time to reconsider.

58:20.667 --> 58:24.626
Since you announced it,
maybe it's for the best?

58:26.376 --> 58:30.041
So you mean, now you've become a hero,

58:30.042 --> 58:32.501
you're gonna throw me to the dogs?

58:36.084 --> 58:37.792
That's my plan.

58:39.292 --> 58:40.709
Sorry about that.

58:45.709 --> 58:48.959
You want a word of advice?

58:49.126 --> 58:52.501
No I don't. I'm sick of advice.

58:52.792 --> 58:55.333
I don't give you advice either.

58:55.334 --> 59:01.209
No more money from thugs,
I'm gonna do clean politics.

59:01.751 --> 59:04.041
You spend so much time
trying to backstab people,

59:04.042 --> 59:07.833
You don't even know if
you're a mayor or a crook.

59:07.834 --> 59:09.459
All right, asshole!

59:09.626 --> 59:13.791
From now on, I'll join
the opposition for real.

59:13.792 --> 59:16.541
Try using that damned brain of yours,

59:16.542 --> 59:19.209
or you might end up dead.

59:20.834 --> 59:23.333
Secretary Eun! Mr. Tae is leaving.

59:23.334 --> 59:26.292
I'm not done talking.

59:26.626 --> 59:29.626
Park, stay there, asshole!

59:30.876 --> 59:32.291
Give me the gun.

59:32.292 --> 59:35.333
Gun? Give me that thing.

59:35.334 --> 59:37.584
- Hurry!
- There are no bullets.

59:37.834 --> 59:41.666
Get over here, fuckhead.
I'll skin you alive.

59:41.667 --> 59:42.667
It's okay.

59:42.959 --> 59:44.959
Calm down. Just be quiet!

59:45.626 --> 59:47.458
What? You gonna stab me with that?

59:47.459 --> 59:50.125
Fuck yeah, you think I won't?

59:50.126 --> 59:52.125
That's all you know how to do?

59:52.126 --> 59:53.750
Hey thugs, get out!

59:53.751 --> 59:54.958
Thugs?

59:54.959 --> 59:57.875
- You think you're a politician?
- Get out!

59:57.876 --> 01:00:00.084
Don't you move!

01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:03.167
What if someone got hurt?

01:00:45.626 --> 01:00:46.417
Get out.

01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:47.292
Did you see it?

01:00:47.293 --> 01:00:49.626
- Get out!
- I did it myself!

01:00:51.126 --> 01:00:52.709
Is he dead?

01:00:53.292 --> 01:00:54.292
Is he?

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:59.251
He's still alive.

01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:02.417
Fuck!

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:05.126
I can do it too, asshole!

01:01:06.126 --> 01:01:07.709
Hands off him!

01:01:08.334 --> 01:01:11.501
Hands off him, you! Get the fuck out.

01:01:14.209 --> 01:01:15.959
Get up.

01:01:16.792 --> 01:01:18.917
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.084
- You're not hurt?
- No.

01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:29.709
I like crazy bastards like him.

01:01:30.042 --> 01:01:32.751
You're a real man, Sun-mo.

01:01:33.584 --> 01:01:34.709
Come on.

01:01:36.251 --> 01:01:40.833
What really happened is, they
were fighting, the two of them.

01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:44.041
And I was passed out here.

01:01:44.042 --> 01:01:47.959
Lying here, passed out cold!

01:01:50.667 --> 01:01:53.209
Why won't the Mayor answer my calls?

01:01:54.042 --> 01:01:55.709
Those are his orders?

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:59.584
Just assume so.
Do you really have to ask?

01:02:00.334 --> 01:02:03.584
Don't be rude.
That can get you killed.

01:02:04.376 --> 01:02:05.542
Yes sir.

01:02:08.126 --> 01:02:10.292
Any response from Tae's gang?

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:14.791
Add some bodyguards, and be alert.

01:02:14.792 --> 01:02:17.376
How is your wife? Is she improving?

01:02:19.542 --> 01:02:24.501
Don't be cocky.
Do you even know what you're doing?

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:29.958
Fuck, you're annoying.

01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:33.084
Always talking down to me.

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:38.334
You're still just a kid.

01:02:41.292 --> 01:02:44.626
I spent last night
drinking with the Mayor,

01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:49.001
and he said he wanted to be
a lifelong partner to this kid.

01:02:49.209 --> 01:02:50.126
So?

01:02:50.127 --> 01:02:51.709
Just letting you know.

01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:59.292
After crushing Tae, you
think you're something?

01:03:01.001 --> 01:03:04.667
You told me to go earn respect
so I tried harder than anyone,

01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:06.459
is that so wrong?

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:09.709
Did I tell you to go berserk? Did I?

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:11.292
Han.

01:03:12.209 --> 01:03:14.084
If you're jealous, you lose!

01:03:14.626 --> 01:03:16.416
You motherfucker!

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:19.251
What are you two doing?

01:03:19.459 --> 01:03:21.542
You're the reason we're
doing this reenactment!

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.417
Did you come to play?

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.834
I'm working my ass off here.

01:03:33.917 --> 01:03:37.208
I hear rumors you're going
around meeting prosecutors.

01:03:37.209 --> 01:03:38.542
Is it true?

01:03:42.667 --> 01:03:44.001
I guess so.

01:03:47.209 --> 01:03:50.376
I'd better report it to the Mayor.

01:03:51.584 --> 01:03:53.584
Will you do it yourself?

01:03:56.042 --> 01:03:59.959
Han, please...

01:04:01.376 --> 01:04:03.959
Don't act like an idiot.

01:04:13.542 --> 01:04:16.708
People are jumping up in all
directions to shield Park.

01:04:16.709 --> 01:04:19.876
Secretary Eun's phone
goes dead after hours.

01:04:21.501 --> 01:04:24.291
I wonder if maybe you gave him a hint.

01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:27.251
Mayor Park bumped off Tae
Byungjo on Saturday.

01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:30.209
A change of heart?

01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:35.500
- You're listening?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:04:35.501 --> 01:04:39.167
- Check on Tae and report back.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:43.834
Park will be in trouble without cash.

01:04:44.042 --> 01:04:46.166
Where will he get his money?

01:04:46.167 --> 01:04:49.791
How far do I have to help
before my job here ends?

01:04:49.792 --> 01:04:51.833
It ends at the end.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:56.126
I'm the bait. Don't you let me go
after catching the big fish?

01:04:56.376 --> 01:04:58.376
Is that why you're recording this?

01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:01.834
You told me to record everything.

01:05:05.626 --> 01:05:09.292
I'm Kim Cha-in, Special Prosecutor.

01:05:09.876 --> 01:05:13.334
Case number 2016-6359.

01:05:13.626 --> 01:05:17.334
If Han Dokyung provides us
with crucial information...

01:05:19.251 --> 01:05:20.667
Put it in writing.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:23.001
Depends on the quality of the info.

01:05:28.876 --> 01:05:32.292
Secretary Eun is on
record calling Minpyung?

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:38.125
You all listening?
Location and content of call.

01:05:38.126 --> 01:05:40.959
<i>What am I saying?</i>

01:05:41.626 --> 01:05:43.876
<i>Am I making a mistake?</i>

01:05:44.376 --> 01:05:46.584
<i>Shit, I don't know.</i>

01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:51.709
<i>No, this is right. No regrets.</i>

01:05:53.209 --> 01:05:55.709
Is something bothering you these days?

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:56.917
No.

01:05:58.459 --> 01:06:01.125
Then why act like a nice husband?

01:06:01.126 --> 01:06:02.459
I am nice.

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:08.126
I like it. After all the bad things
you've done.

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:25.501
Use this for my funeral portrait.

01:06:34.626 --> 01:06:36.042
You're not going to die.

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:38.209
When you get out, let's go to Phuket.

01:06:42.417 --> 01:06:46.292
Don't cry if I die. Since you're a bad guy

01:06:49.501 --> 01:06:50.751
Yun-hee!

01:06:52.334 --> 01:06:55.792
This bed is like a hell.

01:06:56.626 --> 01:07:00.626
I'll get surgery as you wish, then die.

01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:05.709
Don't do anything bad.

01:07:06.626 --> 01:07:09.626
<i>You know I'll be punished for it?</i>

01:07:17.001 --> 01:07:18.751
Did you find Secretary Eun?

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.292
Follow me.

01:07:28.376 --> 01:07:30.084
I brought Han.

01:07:31.584 --> 01:07:34.500
We're going to have to
go in there ourselves.

01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:36.416
Did you find anything?

01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:41.792
Yes, this man wearing the hat.
Looks like Secretary Eun.

01:07:42.584 --> 01:07:44.166
I'll go inside.

01:07:44.167 --> 01:07:47.584
Hey, with those clothes you'll stand out.

01:07:49.001 --> 01:07:51.084
I'll go. Attach the camera.

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:52.417
You'll stand out too.

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:56.167
Han would be better.

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:01.167
You think I'm insane?

01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:03.833
I'll just go. Come on!

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:06.251
You said you're bait!

01:08:09.626 --> 01:08:10.876
Go catch a fish.

01:08:12.084 --> 01:08:14.209
What do you expect?

01:08:14.459 --> 01:08:18.542
So I announce I'm a spy,
and blow myself up?

01:08:19.667 --> 01:08:20.792
Go catch him.

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:22.959
Bring him back.

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:31.126
If it's Secretary Eun, call us.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:44.667
Keep your promise to me.

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:47.041
Haven't we built up enough trust?

01:08:47.042 --> 01:08:49.834
The way you act, I don't trust shit.

01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:55.125
Here's your trust. It's
a copy, you keep it.

01:08:55.126 --> 01:08:57.667
Your arrest warrant has been extended.

01:09:06.251 --> 01:09:08.709
Are you really giving him an exemption?

01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:13.209
There's no such thing in Korea.
Don't you know that?

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.584
So why put in writing?

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:21.042
I'll handle it.

01:09:37.876 --> 01:09:38.709
Out of the way.

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:42.334
Hey son of a bitch. Who the hell are you?

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:44.542
Think this is your backyard?

01:09:45.501 --> 01:09:47.041
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:48.167
He's a cop!

01:09:49.209 --> 01:09:50.625
What are you staring at?

01:09:50.626 --> 01:09:52.082
He doesn't know anything.

01:09:52.084 --> 01:09:53.001
What doesn't he know?

01:09:53.002 --> 01:09:56.001
You're a cop? Give me a break!

01:09:56.167 --> 01:09:58.584
Idiot, I'm a policeman.

01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:01.459
Secretary Eun!

01:10:03.126 --> 01:10:04.709
Kancha, stop!

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:12.251
Don't move! Bastards, I'm gonna shoot you.

01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:15.000
Come here, you prick!

01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:16.501
You fucker!

01:10:17.501 --> 01:10:22.083
Han! I know this guy. Let him go, okay?

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:24.792
This isn't a toy! It's a real gun.

01:10:25.834 --> 01:10:30.042
Please Han, I beg you. Let him go.

01:10:31.376 --> 01:10:32.916
You fuckers are all dead!

01:10:32.917 --> 01:10:37.417
The Mayor doesn't approve of this.
You know that.

01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:42.042
If he finds out, we're in trouble.

01:10:57.584 --> 01:11:00.167
Did you know that prosecutors are outside?

01:11:01.959 --> 01:11:02.834
What?

01:11:02.835 --> 01:11:05.959
I recognized one of them.

01:11:06.292 --> 01:11:08.042
Really?

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:10.501
No, don't!

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.167
You're dead!

01:11:24.501 --> 01:11:25.959
Give me my gun back!

01:11:26.376 --> 01:11:27.501
Stop this!

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:30.458
Get us out of here first.

01:11:30.459 --> 01:11:32.291
You know where's beltway?

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:33.458
You heard of the beltway?

01:11:33.459 --> 01:11:34.709
You need to hurry!

01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:35.834
Go, hurry!

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:37.541
Stop!

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:39.667
You need to go!

01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:50.750
What's that? Do we have to follow it?

01:11:50.751 --> 01:11:52.584
Eun's making a call!

01:11:53.667 --> 01:11:57.458
He's going out the back. Someone's coming.

01:11:57.459 --> 01:11:58.834
Everyone move!

01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:02.834
Are you here? Where, in the alley?

01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:06.417
That's Eun!

01:12:09.084 --> 01:12:10.167
Stop!

01:12:12.292 --> 01:12:13.542
Get him!

01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:31.833
Han, what happened? Did you meet Eun?

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:34.666
What? Where's my gun?

01:12:34.667 --> 01:12:35.667
What gun?

01:12:36.001 --> 01:12:37.875
Where are those bastards?

01:12:37.876 --> 01:12:40.001
I need to catch them!

01:12:40.167 --> 01:12:41.417
Han!

01:12:57.084 --> 01:12:58.084
Out of the way!

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.334
Where are these fuckers?

01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:21.500
Give me my gun, you fuckers!

01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:22.626
Fuck you!

01:13:27.917 --> 01:13:31.334
You want a piece of me?

01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:46.001
You bastards, pull over!

01:13:46.459 --> 01:13:48.792
Are you kidding?

01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:50.459
Give me my gun!!!

01:13:53.626 --> 01:13:54.626
Fuck!

01:14:08.084 --> 01:14:10.501
You're shooting at me? Really?

01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:21.666
You're fucking dead!

01:14:21.667 --> 01:14:23.751
Let's all die together!

01:15:41.126 --> 01:15:42.709
You asshole, where's my gun?

01:16:00.584 --> 01:16:02.292
What the fuck?

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:16.875
Hey, you bastards deliver meth?

01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:19.334
Stop there, you!

<i>was $30 million worth of methamphetamine...</i>

01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.001
You served as Park's
secretary for 20 years?

01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:10.584
But you ran a $30 million
drug business on your own?

01:17:16.917 --> 01:17:18.667
Park ordered it, right?

01:17:33.292 --> 01:17:35.876
The Mayor must be angry?

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:40.126
No, he seems relaxed.
He'll just ask you a few questions.

01:17:42.126 --> 01:17:43.376
What questions?

01:17:45.626 --> 01:17:48.334
You met that damned prosecutor?

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:53.208
If so I'd have told you! Don't you know me?

01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:54.584
Forget it.

01:17:56.459 --> 01:17:59.500
Just don't tell the Mayor
anything unpleasant.

01:17:59.501 --> 01:18:01.876
You think I would?

01:18:05.126 --> 01:18:07.584
Let's look at it objectively.

01:18:07.834 --> 01:18:11.834
You think this drug incident
will just blow over? Huh?

01:18:12.001 --> 01:18:14.500
You're making me laugh.

01:18:14.501 --> 01:18:16.750
You wouldn't know,

01:18:16.751 --> 01:18:20.416
but the Mayor has been
the prosecution's #1 target.

01:18:20.417 --> 01:18:22.876
There's no way out this time!

01:18:23.167 --> 01:18:25.958
So you should slip out of there
quickly and go abroad or...

01:18:25.959 --> 01:18:27.751
Stupid fucker!

01:18:29.667 --> 01:18:31.251
Right, I'm talking about you.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.084
Fuck.

01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:38.709
Hey, Sun-mo.

01:18:40.459 --> 01:18:46.292
If you wear a suit and drive a
foreign car, is life so beautiful?

01:18:57.209 --> 01:18:59.959
Don't you betray the Mayor.

01:19:00.084 --> 01:19:03.709
If you of all people do
that, you're just dogshit.

01:19:03.876 --> 01:19:08.125
I don't understand why you're
so eager to be his gun dog.

01:19:08.126 --> 01:19:10.001
Then don't!

01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:12.667
I don't care if you understand.

<i>US Army Base Redevelopment Site</i>

01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:19.792
You've been meeting
prosecutors for a month?

01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:28.584
Why didn't you tell me?

01:19:30.126 --> 01:19:31.251
You forgot?

01:19:33.542 --> 01:19:39.251
I was being investigated
for the murder of the trial witness.

01:19:39.459 --> 01:19:45.584
This one prosecutor was on my back,
but your name never came up.

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:53.792
Really?

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:59.876
They asked about the witness,
but my name never came up?

01:20:00.584 --> 01:20:01.876
Not at all.

01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:14.334
It really hurts to think that
you backstabbed me.

01:20:18.417 --> 01:20:23.834
How can a dog bite its master?

01:20:35.376 --> 01:20:37.667
I heard it wasn't Junkie who killed Hwang?

01:20:45.126 --> 01:20:51.834
If the prosecutor ties you and
me to the witness' murder,

01:20:53.334 --> 01:20:55.001
you think I'll be in danger?

01:20:57.334 --> 01:20:59.208
Fuck no!

01:20:59.209 --> 01:21:01.250
It's just a passing storm.

01:21:01.251 --> 01:21:04.791
However strong the wind,
I won't be toppled!

01:21:04.792 --> 01:21:07.958
That ordeal will only make me stronger!

01:21:07.959 --> 01:21:09.750
But I'll get pounded!

01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:11.001
Of course!

01:21:11.542 --> 01:21:14.459
But I won't let you get hurt. Why not?

01:21:14.834 --> 01:21:16.834
Because you're one of mine.

01:21:23.584 --> 01:21:28.501
I'm going to smooth things over.
You'll help me?

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:33.751
Yes, sir.

01:21:36.084 --> 01:21:38.251
- Look over here please.
- Mr. Eun!

01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:51.001
Fuck no!

01:22:18.376 --> 01:22:21.209
- The Mayor is doing well?
- Yes.

01:22:50.459 --> 01:22:55.459
Stop the car. Mr. Eun fell out.

01:23:06.209 --> 01:23:07.667
Bro, it's me.

I think we should operate one last time.

01:23:24.501 --> 01:23:27.126
Don't let the interns
practice on her this time.

01:23:32.459 --> 01:23:35.583
You requested this surgery!
I told you there's no hope...

01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:38.959
So do it right! I'll pay, damn it.

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:43.667
Whatever criticism, I
won't try to avoid it.

01:23:43.959 --> 01:23:47.334
If I face the rod, I fully
accept the beating.

01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:51.625
Please save her, okay?

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:58.417
Today, being able to stand in
good conscience before you...

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:01.376
It makes my heart overflow.

<i>this country would have collapsed ages ago.</i>

01:24:18.876 --> 01:24:19.917
Sit.

01:24:20.251 --> 01:24:21.583
I'll stand.

01:24:21.584 --> 01:24:23.417
I said sit!

01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:28.376
This immunity document you gave me...

01:24:28.876 --> 01:24:31.542
Turns out it's a worthless piece of paper!

01:24:34.376 --> 01:24:38.834
I listened to the recording
you made with Park.

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:44.126
But after being edited,
there's nothing we can use!

01:24:44.626 --> 01:24:45.916
Why is it always this way?

01:24:45.917 --> 01:24:49.417
You need to guarantee my safety 100%!

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.083
Then I can record it properly!

01:24:52.084 --> 01:24:55.501
If I'm going down with him,
why should I risk my life?

01:24:55.751 --> 01:24:57.250
What the fuck is this?

01:24:57.251 --> 01:24:59.292
Something really fun.

01:25:09.334 --> 01:25:15.167
Do you realize that I'm your damned savior?

01:25:24.084 --> 01:25:25.167
Sit.

01:25:32.251 --> 01:25:36.916
I thought you'd understand
if I treated you fairly.

01:25:36.917 --> 01:25:39.501
Goddammit!

01:25:39.917 --> 01:25:43.001
My mistake. Sorry.

01:25:44.084 --> 01:25:47.751
I was too humane! There'll
be no more of that.

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:52.000
You're too scared of Park to catch him!

01:25:52.001 --> 01:25:54.125
What is this? Take it off!

01:25:54.126 --> 01:25:57.625
You know your boss was bribed!

01:25:57.626 --> 01:26:01.541
You just follow orders like me,
so why do this to me?

01:26:01.542 --> 01:26:03.167
Take this thing off!

01:26:07.459 --> 01:26:08.167
Do it now.

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:10.417
What! Don't fucking do it!

01:26:17.626 --> 01:26:18.834
Stay still.

01:26:19.167 --> 01:26:20.459
Hold him tight.

01:26:24.626 --> 01:26:26.542
Enough.

01:26:36.834 --> 01:26:39.209
You know what I hate the most?

01:26:42.459 --> 01:26:45.959
Who knows? Go ask your fucking mother.

01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:52.709
Running off at the mouth.
Especially to my face.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:56.709
Careful not to hurt your fists.

01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:04.959
Hold him.

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:22.751
Let go.

01:27:29.542 --> 01:27:30.917
Undo the cuffs.

01:27:32.417 --> 01:27:34.417

01:27:36.917 --> 01:27:39.584
Let me go.

01:27:39.834 --> 01:27:42.209
Let me go, dammit!

01:27:42.542 --> 01:27:44.625
You guys fight on your own.

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.001
Come on, put him back!

01:27:50.834 --> 01:27:52.001
Chief.

01:28:06.667 --> 01:28:10.751
If we don't catch Park,
this will never end.

01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:14.834
You want to keep living in this hell?

01:28:16.751 --> 01:28:18.126
Prosecutor...

01:28:19.917 --> 01:28:22.334
Won't you let me stop?

01:28:29.334 --> 01:28:38.792
Bring evidence of Park ordering
murders of Eun, Tae and the witness!

01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:49.333
I really can't take anymore.

01:28:49.334 --> 01:28:55.001
So your dying wife can take an
ambulance to visit you in jail.

01:28:55.251 --> 01:28:59.083
Don't talk like that about my wife!

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:05.251
Han, just stay still a minute.

01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:06.792

01:29:08.334 --> 01:29:09.626
Get a chair.

01:29:27.251 --> 01:29:29.834
What the heck did you do?

01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:44.042
You feel upset...

01:29:45.292 --> 01:29:46.292

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.001
Yeah.

01:29:52.167 --> 01:29:53.834
So,

01:29:55.459 --> 01:29:59.834

01:31:10.667 --> 01:31:12.334
<i>I'm sorry, Yun-hee.</i>

01:31:14.126 --> 01:31:15.876
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

01:31:22.126 --> 01:31:25.792
<i>Funeral Home</i>

01:32:00.501 --> 01:32:02.626
I'm sorry!

01:32:03.626 --> 01:32:05.541
My poor husband!

01:32:05.542 --> 01:32:07.459
Terribly sorry.

01:32:19.501 --> 01:32:21.417
Didn't expect you here.

01:32:22.751 --> 01:32:24.376
I'll just pay my respects.

01:32:25.042 --> 01:32:28.959
I understand your feelings,
but you'd better go.

01:32:30.459 --> 01:32:32.834
How would you know my feelings?

01:32:34.042 --> 01:32:39.751
What are you whispering about?
If you're here, come in and eat.

01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:10.001
This meat stew...

01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:14.626
It's made at one factory and
delivered over the province.

01:33:15.292 --> 01:33:16.875
It's quite the delicacy.

01:33:16.876 --> 01:33:19.917
Would you believe that I
visit funerals to taste it?

01:33:20.334 --> 01:33:23.751
These are the things people live for.

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:28.167
Sun-mo! Don't stand there, sit.

01:33:29.834 --> 01:33:31.959
- Have a bite.
- Yes.

01:33:34.167 --> 01:33:38.042
So Yun-hee's surgery will take longer?

01:33:38.334 --> 01:33:41.876
I told the hospital chief to assign her

01:33:42.667 --> 01:33:45.041
the best surgeon.

01:33:45.042 --> 01:33:47.626
Appreciate it.

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.626
There are two kinds of sickness.

01:33:54.751 --> 01:33:58.376
One that you catch, but won't kill you.

01:33:58.751 --> 01:34:02.709
And one that will kill you for sure.

01:34:03.417 --> 01:34:05.167
You catch my meaning?

01:34:06.417 --> 01:34:08.376
They say there's no hope.

01:34:08.626 --> 01:34:11.751
Just think you've done
your best as a husband.

01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:16.501
Your words are a bit rude.
No feeling to them.

01:34:25.751 --> 01:34:29.666
Did you come to pay
respects, or to get drunk?

01:34:29.667 --> 01:34:32.417
Stop being so fucking patronizing.

01:34:34.084 --> 01:34:37.375
You may just do it for your image,

01:34:37.376 --> 01:34:39.084
but she's your half-sister!

01:34:42.542 --> 01:34:44.626
Yun-hee is still alive.

01:34:45.417 --> 01:34:48.541
That's why I do all your dirty work.

01:34:48.542 --> 01:34:50.792
Doesn't that make it even?

01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:55.375
That's why I kidnapped the witness for you.

01:34:55.376 --> 01:34:57.376
Shut the fuck up.

01:35:05.876 --> 01:35:06.876
Bro!

01:35:31.917 --> 01:35:36.251
I've lost my appetite.

01:35:38.542 --> 01:35:40.084
When do I die?

01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:53.126
Why are you so hilarious today?

01:36:01.917 --> 01:36:04.334
Just tell me if I live or die.

01:36:05.417 --> 01:36:08.376
Everyone dies, when the time comes.

01:36:12.042 --> 01:36:16.126
Did Secretary Eun know he was going to die?

01:36:19.334 --> 01:36:21.292
<i>Han, stop talking like that.</i>

01:36:21.834 --> 01:36:25.416
Don't provoke him, you fucking idiot.

01:36:25.417 --> 01:36:27.625
Seems to me Han is doing well.

01:36:27.626 --> 01:36:29.709
Tell him to ask about Tae.

01:36:30.542 --> 01:36:32.833
His talk is making me nervous.

01:36:32.834 --> 01:36:33.959
Let's trust him.

01:36:34.376 --> 01:36:35.958
<i>Hey, Han.</i>

01:36:35.959 --> 01:36:39.291
<i>The Prosecutor trusts you, but I don't.</i>

01:36:39.292 --> 01:36:42.126
<i>So don't fuck it up.</i>

01:36:42.667 --> 01:36:45.666
Will you all fucking shut up?

01:36:45.667 --> 01:36:48.959
I'll handle it, so stop interfering.

01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:52.834
Who the hell are you talking to?

01:36:58.334 --> 01:36:59.876
Prosecutor Kim Cha-in.

01:37:10.751 --> 01:37:12.417
We're screwed.

01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:15.209
Let's wrap up.

01:37:15.626 --> 01:37:20.001
<i>Han, get the fuck out of there now!</i>

01:37:22.584 --> 01:37:25.459
- Get out there, bitch!
- Wait.

01:37:27.626 --> 01:37:30.333
If he wanted to speak to Park,
he would do this discreetly.

01:37:30.334 --> 01:37:31.709
Why does he talk so we can hear?

01:37:40.751 --> 01:37:43.459
<i>From now on I'll repeat
what I hear in my ear.</i>

01:37:44.334 --> 01:37:46.626
I'm Special Prosecutor Kim Cha-in.

01:37:47.126 --> 01:37:54.001
Through the bugs we planted,
we now have solid evidence

01:37:54.292 --> 01:38:00.583
of the murders of Eun and Junkie,
and the transport of drugs.

01:38:00.584 --> 01:38:04.167
That prosecutor is a dimwitted sleaze!

01:38:05.751 --> 01:38:12.459
He doesn't know illegally acquired
evidence is void in court?

01:38:12.917 --> 01:38:18.000
First we'll send audio files
to the top 3 newspapers.

01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:20.834
<i>If they pass, we'll spread
it all over the internet.</i>

01:38:21.459 --> 01:38:25.291
We're going to burn you alive.

01:38:25.292 --> 01:38:28.001
We're all going down together?

01:38:29.584 --> 01:38:31.709
The young prosecutor's got some spirit.

01:38:33.626 --> 01:38:35.584
He's outside now.

01:38:41.167 --> 01:38:43.667
I'm dumbstruck.

01:38:44.167 --> 01:38:45.167
Hey, drive away!

01:38:55.084 --> 01:38:58.042
Get out!

01:39:01.251 --> 01:39:01.917
Duck!

01:39:01.918 --> 01:39:04.541
- Everyone get out!
- Don't make a sound.

01:39:04.542 --> 01:39:06.334
I know you're in there!

01:39:06.542 --> 01:39:08.001
Should we call for backup?

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.876
Don't panic!

01:39:10.126 --> 01:39:12.209
Hey, shoot everything!

01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:16.792
Everything recorded here
will be submitted as evidence.

01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:19.709
We'll shoot everything!

01:39:23.667 --> 01:39:26.709
Sir, don't come out for any reason.

01:39:27.042 --> 01:39:28.209
Seung-mi stay here.

01:39:30.501 --> 01:39:32.084
What the hell? Shut that off.

01:39:34.626 --> 01:39:35.626
Stand up.

01:39:35.709 --> 01:39:37.376
You bitch!

01:39:37.542 --> 01:39:39.376
Don't let a single person leave!

01:39:39.584 --> 01:39:41.584
We're investigators from
the District Prosecutor's.

01:39:43.834 --> 01:39:49.001
I'm calling to report illegal
wiretapping of the Annam Mayor.

01:39:49.542 --> 01:39:54.001
Send the police to the
funeral home parking lot.

01:39:54.209 --> 01:39:55.667
Moon Sun-mo.

01:39:55.959 --> 01:39:59.251
Don't be fresh. We'll cuff you all.

01:40:01.459 --> 01:40:03.458
They're carrying weapons too.

01:40:03.459 --> 01:40:08.376
They say they're public servants,
but there's a group of them.

01:40:09.876 --> 01:40:11.542
Get here in 5 minutes.

01:40:13.042 --> 01:40:14.959
What did that son of a bitch say?

01:40:15.584 --> 01:40:16.958
Can you get there in 5 minutes?

01:40:16.959 --> 01:40:18.251
Let's go.

01:40:18.792 --> 01:40:22.541
You put bugs and cameras
on a popularly-elected mayor,

01:40:22.542 --> 01:40:24.876
and thought you'd get away with it?

01:40:25.834 --> 01:40:31.626
I promise you Kim Cha-in,
you're going down this time.

01:40:32.584 --> 01:40:34.709
Hey, any reply?

01:40:36.792 --> 01:40:39.084
Prosecutor, say something.

01:40:40.042 --> 01:40:44.167
<i>Han, what are you doing?</i>
Are you blowing yourself up?

01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:50.542
He wants to meet you, man to man.

01:40:58.667 --> 01:41:01.001
He wants me to go in there?

01:41:01.334 --> 01:41:05.084
Trying to be clever with
an inadequate brain.

01:41:05.376 --> 01:41:06.833
This is driving me crazy.

01:41:06.834 --> 01:41:09.292
I just thought of something.

01:41:11.417 --> 01:41:12.751
He's inside.

01:41:20.501 --> 01:41:22.876
Nice to meet you!

01:41:25.792 --> 01:41:26.959
Have you tried the meat stew?

01:41:27.959 --> 01:41:32.541
Then you haven't paid
respects to Secretary Eun?

01:41:32.542 --> 01:41:40.209
Oh my, there's no one on earth
as shameless as our Mayor.

01:41:40.376 --> 01:41:44.584
Bitch, I'm going to crush you like a bug.

01:41:45.876 --> 01:41:48.250
What's the point of spilling blood?

01:41:48.251 --> 01:41:50.959
Why don't the two of you talk things over?

01:41:52.542 --> 01:41:55.459
Wow, look at that glare.

01:41:56.917 --> 01:41:59.459
There are two kinds of people.

01:41:59.751 --> 01:42:02.500
Bastards who hear reason.

01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:09.209
And bastard numbskulls who however
much you explain, don't listen.

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:14.001
What kind of bastard is our Prosecutor?

01:42:16.209 --> 01:42:21.959
Hope you're not a bastard to spout
long prologues full of nonsense.

01:42:26.167 --> 01:42:33.416
I hope these sort of things

01:42:33.417 --> 01:42:37.084
won't be used to torment public servants!

01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:51.292
We're all busy men, how
about we speak openly?

01:43:07.834 --> 01:43:11.458
Sir, you shouldn't get mixed up in this.

01:43:11.459 --> 01:43:14.834
What do you mean, mixed up?
We're just going to talk.

01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:19.334
You go outside.

01:43:20.167 --> 01:43:21.292
Good!

01:43:41.834 --> 01:43:43.709
What's your price?

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:46.751
I'd like to just buy you.

01:43:47.251 --> 01:43:51.583
You're a public servant too,
you know my salary.

01:43:51.584 --> 01:43:53.626
I'm cheap.

01:43:54.626 --> 01:44:00.709
All I want is testimony that
you ordered people killed.

01:44:03.667 --> 01:44:04.751
Really?

01:44:05.584 --> 01:44:08.501
That's more important than money?

01:44:12.042 --> 01:44:15.667
Show me a man on earth
who doesn't like money!

01:44:17.917 --> 01:44:20.417
I've done my research too.

01:44:21.251 --> 01:44:24.626
Your boss, Chief Prosecutor Oh

01:44:25.084 --> 01:44:26.917
takes money from everyone!

01:44:31.084 --> 01:44:33.584
Mayor Park will not just roll over.

01:44:34.501 --> 01:44:40.001
Even if I go down, I'll
take everyone with me!

01:44:40.334 --> 01:44:42.833
You sure talk big.

01:44:42.834 --> 01:44:45.667
Our Mayor is as grandiose as advertised!

01:44:46.001 --> 01:44:52.626
Life is damn short, we
should live honestly.

01:44:54.459 --> 01:44:56.916
Honestly, how much did
you figure to buy me for?

01:44:56.917 --> 01:44:58.584
I'm curious about the figure.

01:45:00.209 --> 01:45:04.709
It starts with a 5. Then some zeroes...

01:45:08.876 --> 01:45:10.501
Oh, gosh.

01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:13.959
I should have introduced you earlier.

01:45:14.167 --> 01:45:15.500
I knew you'd get along.

01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:18.833
You damned jackal! You're
on my nerves today!

01:45:18.834 --> 01:45:21.667
If you get your price,
you'll be thankful to me.

01:45:22.376 --> 01:45:24.041
You deserve a fee for introductions.

01:45:24.042 --> 01:45:26.417
No, Mayor, I couldn't!

01:45:27.626 --> 01:45:31.876
Be sure to persuade the Prosecutor.

01:45:32.834 --> 01:45:38.875
This is too hard for me,

01:45:38.876 --> 01:45:42.459
I can't keep going back and forth.

01:45:46.542 --> 01:45:48.834
You two talk it over.

01:45:53.501 --> 01:45:57.542
That poor guy...

01:46:05.001 --> 01:46:07.292
Please stay inside.

01:46:23.126 --> 01:46:24.667
Son of a bitch!

01:46:26.501 --> 01:46:28.791
You can't cause a scene now.

01:46:28.792 --> 01:46:30.291
Why'd you call them?

01:46:30.292 --> 01:46:33.501
I've something to talk to you about.

01:46:34.417 --> 01:46:37.166
I'm being completely honest with you.

01:46:37.167 --> 01:46:40.376
So don't take this as a sham. Have a seat.

01:46:43.376 --> 01:46:49.667
Without Chief Prosecutor Oh,
you're nothing.

01:46:51.251 --> 01:46:59.166
I could make you Chief Prosecutor
or Supreme Prosecutor if I tried.

01:46:59.167 --> 01:47:02.041
As a man, wouldn't you want
to be at the top one day?

01:47:02.042 --> 01:47:06.042
You say the boldest things.

01:47:06.417 --> 01:47:09.001
Did you think I'd be so easily seduced?

01:47:09.209 --> 01:47:12.333
You came here to bury me,

01:47:12.334 --> 01:47:14.959
what wouldn't I do to live?

01:47:15.917 --> 01:47:19.792
In order to win your generosity
and have you save me,

01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:23.541
I need to sweeten the pot.

01:47:23.542 --> 01:47:25.334
Your eyes...

01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:32.917
are not the sort of eyes
to be trusted, Mayor.

01:47:37.751 --> 01:47:40.626
You don't accept my sincerity.

01:47:44.251 --> 01:47:46.542
Such a shame.

01:47:49.459 --> 01:47:52.251
Park had no intention of
persuading Kim Cha-in?

01:47:56.459 --> 01:47:58.791
Can't you read the situation?

01:47:58.792 --> 01:48:00.750
If you do something stupid, we all die.

01:48:00.751 --> 01:48:02.291
He's a prosecutor, you can't beat him!

01:48:02.292 --> 01:48:04.792
The Mayor beats everyone.

01:48:05.001 --> 01:48:08.042
Sure, because he always
sacrifices someone else.

01:48:08.501 --> 01:48:10.459
Who will it be this time?

01:48:11.292 --> 01:48:12.917
You killed Eun, didn't you?

01:48:17.667 --> 01:48:20.126
I'm asking, was it you?

01:48:24.042 --> 01:48:26.751
Goddammit.

01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:30.667
Yes I did, why?

01:48:32.251 --> 01:48:35.626
You know why I'm in this rotten situation?

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:37.708
Because of you.

01:48:37.709 --> 01:48:40.584
You convinced me!

01:48:41.626 --> 01:48:44.376
Now I've got nowhere to run.

01:48:46.792 --> 01:48:48.292
Sun-mo!

01:48:48.626 --> 01:48:51.666
He's going to keep using
us all of our lives.

01:48:51.667 --> 01:48:52.958
You see the state I'm in?

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:55.708
You want me to get killed
like a dog in the Philippines?

01:48:55.709 --> 01:49:00.458
Let's get out of here, the two of us.
Okay, Sun-mo?

01:49:00.459 --> 01:49:02.501
Leave them to fight each other.

01:49:03.209 --> 01:49:04.833
Kim Cha-in's not after us.

01:49:04.834 --> 01:49:08.126
You pretend to be smart
but you don't know nothing!

01:49:10.126 --> 01:49:12.542
You know what the Mayor told me?

01:49:13.167 --> 01:49:16.667
"Han is a traitor. Rub him out."

01:49:19.292 --> 01:49:20.542
He was right.

01:49:34.376 --> 01:49:37.709
He wants you to do it?

01:49:38.334 --> 01:49:40.001
Don't ask me.

01:49:46.584 --> 01:49:48.417
Can you really shoot?

01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:49.751
Sure.

01:49:52.667 --> 01:49:54.376
Then shoot me, bastard!

01:49:54.459 --> 01:49:55.459
Hey!

01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:57.834
Stop!

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:01.167
Don't move!

01:50:04.292 --> 01:50:06.167
You'll shoot me?

01:50:08.834 --> 01:50:10.292
Hey, Sun-mo.

01:50:12.792 --> 01:50:14.959
You can't shoot me.

01:50:15.917 --> 01:50:20.126
You're so naive. You think I can't?

01:50:20.501 --> 01:50:22.209
Shall I do it?

01:50:24.042 --> 01:50:26.208
Go ahead, asshole.

01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:27.459
Shoot!

01:50:45.001 --> 01:50:46.834
Let go!

01:52:17.959 --> 01:52:20.709
Shoot, you prick.

01:52:21.459 --> 01:52:22.666
I will.

01:52:22.667 --> 01:52:25.751
Pull the damn trigger.

01:52:26.251 --> 01:52:27.501
Shoot me!

01:52:27.917 --> 01:52:29.876
Let go, asshole!

01:52:33.084 --> 01:52:36.667
You son of a...

01:52:38.167 --> 01:52:40.042
Oh, fuck!

01:52:40.959 --> 01:52:43.042
I'm sorry, okay?

01:52:46.209 --> 01:52:47.501
You're sorry to me?

01:52:48.251 --> 01:52:50.376
Yes I am, fuck!

01:52:54.376 --> 01:52:56.376
You're fucking crazy.

01:53:13.001 --> 01:53:15.959
This is all because of you, you know?

01:53:19.459 --> 01:53:21.084
What should I do?

01:53:32.667 --> 01:53:38.542
Bro, don't ever trust that asshole Park.

01:53:49.376 --> 01:53:51.459
- Let go!
- Hey, Sun-mo!

01:54:15.834 --> 01:54:17.542
Okay, that'll do.

01:54:19.626 --> 01:54:23.501
This was recorded with
permission of the Korean court.

01:54:25.376 --> 01:54:28.042
You'll receive a summons soon.

01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:31.291
You playing tricks again?

01:54:31.292 --> 01:54:36.084
People who know the law
in this country are all fuckers.

01:54:37.792 --> 01:54:39.209
Okay, let's go!

01:54:40.126 --> 01:54:41.208
Out of the way.

01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.834
Move.

01:54:41.835 --> 01:54:43.709
- What is this?
- Come out, sir.

01:54:48.042 --> 01:54:49.709
- Let's go, quick.
- Prosecutor.

01:54:56.626 --> 01:54:58.084
Let's go...

01:55:00.084 --> 01:55:01.667
Stick together.

01:55:04.292 --> 01:55:10.416
Park, if you do this to a
prosecutor, it's life in prison!

01:55:10.417 --> 01:55:11.834
Get your gun.

01:55:12.626 --> 01:55:17.209
You thought you were smart,
but you didn't think it through.

01:55:17.792 --> 01:55:21.959
We can just tell them to
cut off one of my arms.

01:55:22.501 --> 01:55:26.042
You know the forced eviction
of foreigners on Minpyung?

01:55:26.792 --> 01:55:32.501
The guys who lived there have
come to commit terror against me.

01:55:32.876 --> 01:55:35.126
Are you insane? Huh?

01:55:35.501 --> 01:55:40.000
But you just happened to
be here today, sorry!

01:55:40.001 --> 01:55:43.333
No warning shots. Just fire.

01:55:43.334 --> 01:55:45.833
What is this prick saying?

01:55:45.834 --> 01:55:49.500
Shoot. Don't be afraid.

01:55:49.501 --> 01:55:50.626
Do it!

01:56:16.917 --> 01:56:19.167
What do we do?

01:56:24.251 --> 01:56:26.167
You fool.

01:56:26.459 --> 01:56:28.626
Fuck.

01:56:29.834 --> 01:56:32.334
What should I do?

01:56:34.167 --> 01:56:36.459
You really shot me?

01:56:40.334 --> 01:56:42.916
You'll be okay, you won't die.

01:56:42.917 --> 01:56:47.501
Bro. I'm fucked, right?

01:56:47.792 --> 01:56:52.626
No, you bastard. I'll save you, I promise.

01:56:54.542 --> 01:56:58.584
Kiss my fat ass...

01:57:06.751 --> 01:57:09.459
Sun-mo...

01:57:11.042 --> 01:57:13.417
Goddamn you...

01:57:45.292 --> 01:57:49.584
God, I'm so tired.

01:58:04.001 --> 01:58:07.126
Get out here, fat ass!

01:58:12.584 --> 01:58:15.709
Stop hitting me. Stop.

01:58:16.584 --> 01:58:18.626
I'm a Korean prosecutor!

01:58:19.001 --> 01:58:22.126
On your knees, prick!

01:58:34.126 --> 01:58:36.959
Sir, I've made a grave mistake.

01:58:38.584 --> 01:58:41.375
Okay good. Let's shake hands.

01:58:41.376 --> 01:58:45.042
Take your hand away before I cut it off!

01:58:45.292 --> 01:58:46.834
Put it down.

01:58:47.459 --> 01:58:52.250
Now you can feel my sincerity?

01:58:52.251 --> 01:58:57.667
Mayor, isn't there such a
thing as a last chance?

01:58:57.959 --> 01:59:00.001
Hell no.

01:59:01.334 --> 01:59:04.376
Hey Kim Cha-in, watch this.

01:59:04.792 --> 01:59:06.459
My arm.

01:59:07.126 --> 01:59:08.458
Hey! Cut off my arm.

01:59:08.459 --> 01:59:09.334
What?

01:59:09.335 --> 01:59:12.751
Cut off my arm, fucker! Grab it!

01:59:13.209 --> 01:59:14.209
Grab it!

01:59:14.209 --> 01:59:14.834
Sir...

01:59:14.835 --> 01:59:16.458
Gimme that.

01:59:16.459 --> 01:59:18.208
Hold properly, damn it.

01:59:18.209 --> 01:59:19.834
Watch this, Kim Cha-in!

01:59:21.126 --> 01:59:22.959
Mayor!

01:59:23.334 --> 01:59:25.001
Mayor.

01:59:25.084 --> 01:59:28.334
Why are you wounding yourself?

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:37.167
I'll be completely loyal to you.

01:59:38.542 --> 01:59:40.167
I swear!

01:59:41.001 --> 01:59:43.501
I'm not saying it to save myself.

01:59:43.834 --> 01:59:48.709
You keep your arm. And Annam Metropolis.

02:00:00.626 --> 02:00:02.251
Loyal...

02:00:03.084 --> 02:00:08.959
Let's see if you can
become one of my people.

02:00:10.584 --> 02:00:12.792
You finish her off.

02:00:14.001 --> 02:00:15.751
Finish it...

02:00:17.084 --> 02:00:19.751
Record this with your camera.

02:00:22.001 --> 02:00:24.501
Okay, the camera is running.

02:00:37.834 --> 02:00:39.292
Sir...

02:00:41.084 --> 02:00:42.209
Mayor.

02:00:44.584 --> 02:00:46.167
Do I have your word?

02:00:47.792 --> 02:00:49.001
Good!

02:01:19.126 --> 02:01:23.251
That bitch's crying is getting
on my nerves, finish her off!

02:01:47.001 --> 02:01:50.292
- Who is it?
- Han Do-kyung.

02:01:58.084 --> 02:01:59.626
Han, is that you?

02:02:04.417 --> 02:02:07.333
Did your talk with Sun-mo go badly?

02:02:07.334 --> 02:02:08.459
Yeah...

02:02:10.792 --> 02:02:12.376
I killed him.

02:02:19.417 --> 02:02:23.834
Oh my, look what's happened because of you!

02:02:24.126 --> 02:02:27.875
You were like brothers. And the prosecutor!

02:02:27.876 --> 02:02:30.001
Sir, come on out.

02:02:38.126 --> 02:02:40.626
You're going to kill me too?

02:02:41.667 --> 02:02:44.876
Wow, you're a real monster!

02:02:45.209 --> 02:02:46.959
Park Sung-bae, get out here!

02:02:48.584 --> 02:02:50.126
Get out there!

02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:52.001
Go!

02:03:26.376 --> 02:03:30.042
What now? You're out of bullets!

02:03:30.334 --> 02:03:33.167
I'm going to kill you!

02:03:37.042 --> 02:03:38.791
With what?

02:03:38.792 --> 02:03:40.083
How will you kill me?

02:03:40.084 --> 02:03:42.167
Don't touch, you prick.

02:03:45.001 --> 02:03:46.458
Listen to me.

02:03:46.459 --> 02:03:50.375
Watch how I clean up here.

02:03:50.376 --> 02:03:52.001
You madman.

02:03:52.667 --> 02:03:53.834
Miss!

02:03:54.209 --> 02:03:55.958
Where did you go, sweetie?

02:03:55.959 --> 02:03:57.501
Where are you?

02:03:57.917 --> 02:03:59.167
There you are.

02:04:08.459 --> 02:04:10.334
Alright...

02:04:11.626 --> 02:04:18.000
Hey, Park Sung-bae! Let's fight, fucker.

02:04:18.001 --> 02:04:20.959
Who do you think you're dealing with?

02:04:58.001 --> 02:05:00.584
I want to kill you,

02:05:02.667 --> 02:05:07.376
but you'll have so much work to do.

02:05:11.126 --> 02:05:13.126
Call an ambulance.

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:19.042
Call an ambulance!

02:05:24.626 --> 02:05:26.501
I need an ambulance.

02:05:32.751 --> 02:05:33.959
Prosecutor Kim.

02:05:34.292 --> 02:05:35.501
Listen up.

02:05:35.751 --> 02:05:40.959
We need to think of a way
to clean up this mess.

02:05:41.126 --> 02:05:43.292
Please call an ambulance!

02:05:44.167 --> 02:05:45.167
Gently! Gently!

02:05:45.168 --> 02:05:47.251
You pig.

02:05:47.334 --> 02:05:51.751
I've been shot! I've been shot...

02:05:52.917 --> 02:05:54.792
I've thought up a story.

02:05:55.251 --> 02:05:59.750
Han there was found to be Sgt.
Hwang's killer,

02:05:59.751 --> 02:06:03.792
and so he went crazy.

02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:09.751
So you got shot, and I'm a victim too?

02:06:11.959 --> 02:06:17.292
If you call an ambulance
now, I'll support you.

02:06:18.667 --> 02:06:19.834
Okay?

02:06:22.584 --> 02:06:24.916
Now I can see

02:06:24.917 --> 02:06:27.251
you're just like me.

02:06:49.042 --> 02:06:51.709
You're so annoying.

02:06:56.084 --> 02:06:58.709
You scared me.

02:06:59.959 --> 02:07:02.542
You know what your problem is?

02:07:07.626 --> 02:07:13.167
Yeah, I got lots of problems. I know.

02:07:18.959 --> 02:07:23.167
Little guy like you has such a big temper.

02:07:25.542 --> 02:07:28.084
Kiss my fat ass, sucker!

02:08:59.626 --> 02:09:01.501
<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

02:09:02.417 --> 02:09:04.084
<i>But...</i>

02:09:05.459 --> 02:09:07.376
