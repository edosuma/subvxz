00:01.934 --> 00:04.102
I'm so happy I could <i>plotz.</i>

00:04.103 --> 00:05.170
Not on the kitchen table.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.973
You can say goodbye
to this furry little <i>punim.</i>

00:07.974 --> 00:09.007
What's with the Yiddish?

00:09.008 --> 00:10.642
Are you going
into show business?

00:10.643 --> 00:12.510
I'm online with a camel
in Jerusalem

00:12.511 --> 00:14.045
who used to be
an Amway salesman.

00:14.046 --> 00:16.681
Why'd the Witches' Council
turn him into a camel?

00:16.682 --> 00:18.917
He used to be
an Amway salesman.

00:18.918 --> 00:21.953
Anyway, he was wandering through
the desert and found a scroll

00:21.954 --> 00:23.989
that says witches like me
can be turned back

00:23.990 --> 00:26.324
into their former selves
if they're kissed

00:26.325 --> 00:28.126
by someone who loves them.

00:28.127 --> 00:30.762
Why can't you just play
Solitaire like regular cats?

00:30.763 --> 00:33.431
One little kiss and I can,
once again, be a man.

00:33.432 --> 00:35.100
I'll no longer be
a <i>shlemiel.</i>

00:35.101 --> 00:37.669
Salem,
don't trust chat rooms.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.569
Besides, you little <i>yutz,</i>

00:38.570 --> 00:40.171
who you gonna get
to kiss you?

00:40.172 --> 00:42.740
Pucker up.
If I help turn you into a man,

00:42.741 --> 00:44.775
the Witches' Council
will turn me into a cat.

00:44.776 --> 00:47.745
Ugh. What a sad, pathetic
existence that would be.

00:47.746 --> 00:48.813
Moving on.

00:48.814 --> 00:50.849
I love you, Zelda.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.551
I love you too,

00:52.552 --> 00:54.552
but I'm not in love
with you.

00:54.553 --> 00:55.853
Oh, Sabrina...

00:55.854 --> 00:57.021
Not until you find
a new way

00:57.022 --> 00:58.390
of grooming yourself.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.391
Mean. There must be
somebody out there

01:00.392 --> 01:02.460
who's not so stingy
with kisses.

01:04.296 --> 01:08.033
Oh, Lord,
he's got toilet-water breath.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.033
Oh!

01:26.351 --> 01:28.853
I feel udderly ridiculous.

01:34.693 --> 01:37.362
Look at all the great stuff
I found for Physics.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.865
Our jet propulsion project's
really gonna take off.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.333
( chuckles )

01:41.334 --> 01:43.134
Not even a mercy laugh.

01:43.135 --> 01:45.470
I just want you to know I'm not
one of those creepy girls

01:45.471 --> 01:48.106
who drops all her friends just
'cause she's dating a guy.

01:48.107 --> 01:49.707
You and Justin are dating?

01:49.708 --> 01:50.708
No.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.177
He asked you out, right?

01:52.178 --> 01:53.244
No.

01:53.245 --> 01:54.679
But you met him, right?

01:54.680 --> 01:55.980
I don't know.

01:55.981 --> 01:57.882
I've imagined
so many conversations with him,

01:57.883 --> 01:59.917
I can't separate fiction
from reality.

01:59.918 --> 02:02.053
Hey, guys,
the soda machine's broken.

02:02.054 --> 02:03.855
You can get
all the free drinks you want.

02:03.856 --> 02:04.989
( all clamoring )

02:04.990 --> 02:06.590
Hey, I'm open. Ooh!

02:06.591 --> 02:08.158
Isn't that kinda like stealing?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.360
Oh, great.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.195
Now my soda's tainted.

02:11.196 --> 02:15.199
I never associated root beer
with a moral dilemma before.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.601
There he is.

02:16.602 --> 02:18.270
Do you think
he'll ever ask me out?

02:18.271 --> 02:19.737
Why don't you ask him out?

02:19.738 --> 02:21.072
That's just a nice way
of saying no.

02:21.073 --> 02:22.407
Look, you can ask him out.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.976
We're modern women.
We know about jet propulsion.

02:24.977 --> 02:26.510
We do?
We will.

02:26.511 --> 02:28.145
Look, I can't.
I'll get too nervous.

02:28.146 --> 02:30.982
When I get nervous, my mouth
dries out and I can't speak.

02:30.983 --> 02:32.784
Take your soda, and every time
your mouth gets dry,

02:32.785 --> 02:35.286
just take a sip.

02:35.287 --> 02:36.954
All right, I'll do it.

02:39.224 --> 02:40.358
Hi.

02:42.294 --> 02:43.361
Hi.

02:47.399 --> 02:49.267
So, Justin...

02:49.268 --> 02:51.203
So, Valerie...

02:52.337 --> 02:54.171
you want to go out
Saturday night?

( belches )

03:00.980 --> 03:03.080

03:03.081 --> 03:05.150
Well, at least
she broke the ice.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.919
And the sound barrier.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.420
( chuckles )

03:09.421 --> 03:10.655
Valerie?

03:10.656 --> 03:11.690
Valerie.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.992
Help me to the emergency exit.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.294
Come on. You got to give
Justin your answer.

03:16.295 --> 03:17.962
Don't blow it.
I already blew it.

03:17.963 --> 03:19.297
Right in his face.

03:19.298 --> 03:22.233
He's a guy. They study burping
as a second language.

03:22.234 --> 03:23.701
Besides, nobody else heard.

03:23.702 --> 03:25.503
You heard and you were
across the room.

03:25.504 --> 03:28.173
I was being a good friend
and eavesdropping.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.408
Trust me. No one heard.
Now, come on.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.846
Don't make me start
the speech from <i>Ice Castles.</i>

03:38.417 --> 03:40.452
Everyone,
a big welcome

03:40.453 --> 03:42.119
for Valerie Burphead.

03:42.120 --> 03:45.155
( all laugh )

03:45.156 --> 03:47.725
They're just jealous.
You're so mean.

03:47.726 --> 03:49.527
HILDA:
Come on. Let's go see <i>Titanic.</i>

03:49.528 --> 03:50.695
We could change
the ending.

03:50.696 --> 03:52.731
Oh, Hilda,
no one's gonna pay $7

03:52.732 --> 03:55.199
to watch you kiss
Leonardo DiCaprio.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.701
Besides, I have
a date Friday night,

03:57.702 --> 03:59.204
and I'm cleaning
my ears.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.505
Last chance
to throw yours in.

04:01.506 --> 04:03.208
I just cleaned my ears.
They're fine.

04:03.976 --> 04:05.910
( bird caws )

04:06.879 --> 04:09.046
Well, at least
no locusts this year.

Help! I need help!

04:12.417 --> 04:14.986

04:14.987 --> 04:18.523
Oh, Salem, caught with your head
in the cookie jar?

04:18.524 --> 04:20.190
Hurry. Please, hurry.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.526
I've been in here
for over an hour.

04:22.527 --> 04:23.928
Why didn't you call us sooner?

04:23.929 --> 04:26.564
It wasn't a problem until
I ran out of peanut brittle.

04:26.565 --> 04:28.999
Salem, is this
a desperate cry for help?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.068
No. This is:

04:30.069 --> 04:31.736
Help! I'm running out of air!

04:31.737 --> 04:34.338
Zap it off and give me
mouth-to-mouth.

04:34.339 --> 04:36.941
Salem, you just want a kiss.

04:36.942 --> 04:39.110
My lips are sweet
with brittle.

04:39.111 --> 04:40.778
I guess
we <i>should</i> remove it.

04:40.779 --> 04:43.280
Do you want to drive him
to the vet, or should I?

04:43.281 --> 04:44.582
Not the vet.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.417
Cold hands, cold table.

04:46.418 --> 04:47.652
And the probing...

04:47.653 --> 04:50.021
Oh, the probing.

04:50.022 --> 04:52.524
Perfect way
to teach you a lesson.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.193
I should have suffocated
when I had the chance.

04:57.029 --> 04:59.597
I bet they didn't even
disinfect the table.

04:59.598 --> 05:02.266
I'm gonna get a disease.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.602
Salem, this is a mortal vet,
be quiet.

05:04.603 --> 05:06.470
And start acting
like a cat.

05:06.471 --> 05:08.873
You want a cat? I can do cat.

05:15.047 --> 05:19.049
And this must
be Salem Saberhagen.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.151
You have different
last names.

05:20.152 --> 05:21.385
Well,
when we adopted him

05:21.386 --> 05:22.720
he didn't want
to change his name.

05:22.721 --> 05:25.489
Heh. And to hyphen it
just seemed ridiculous.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.925
Don't worry.
I'm a crazy cat-lady too.

05:27.926 --> 05:29.293

Oh, I think kitty was
playing Pooh Bear.

Ow! U-uh, meow.

05:39.838 --> 05:42.473
I'll be right back
with some lubricant.

05:42.474 --> 05:44.709
I love her.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.477
Hello? She's a woman,

05:46.478 --> 05:48.145
and she's not
in love with you.

05:48.146 --> 05:49.947
Please. All vets love animals.

05:49.948 --> 05:52.283
And once I get her to kiss me,
I'll be a man.

Oh. There.

06:04.763 --> 06:06.096
Oh.

06:15.574 --> 06:17.775
Hey,
the soda machine's fixed.

06:17.776 --> 06:19.711
I put in
a couple extra quarters

06:19.712 --> 06:21.713
to clear my root beer-soaked
conscience.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.748
Well, that should cover
the 15 sodas you had.

06:23.749 --> 06:25.082
Have you seen Valerie?

06:25.083 --> 06:26.150
No.

06:26.151 --> 06:28.319
I haven't seen
or heard Burpzilla

06:28.320 --> 06:30.387
since the incident.

06:30.388 --> 06:32.991
Someday, your body
will betray you, Libby,

06:32.992 --> 06:33.958
and we'll be waiting.

06:33.959 --> 06:35.526
I'm really worried
about Valerie.

06:35.527 --> 06:36.961
You think
she went home?

06:36.962 --> 06:39.597
Well, she did seem to have
some gastric problems.

06:39.598 --> 06:40.732
She really should be here

06:40.733 --> 06:42.734
so that we could taunt her
to her face.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.168
Libby, why do you get
so much pleasure

06:44.169 --> 06:45.737
out of other people's pain?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.205
I'm just a positive,
upbeat person.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.910
How could Dr. Werner cone me?

06:52.911 --> 06:55.346
Salem, it'll keep you
from licking your wound.

06:55.347 --> 06:57.782
You're the one who cut
your head on peanut brittle.

06:57.783 --> 06:59.417
I'll never get kissed
like this.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.619
I look like a Victrola.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.689
Good idea. Then we won't have
to listen to you complain.

So how was your day?

07:15.367 --> 07:17.001
I'm a little worried
about poor Valerie.

07:17.002 --> 07:18.570
I mean,
she burped at lunch

07:18.571 --> 07:20.037
and I haven't
seen her since.

07:20.038 --> 07:21.773
Oh, well, I guess you want
to hear about the time

07:21.774 --> 07:23.040
I burped
in high school.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.042
Not really.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.209
I gotta go
call Valerie.

07:27.145 --> 07:30.215
You know what
I haven't heard in ages?

07:30.216 --> 07:32.650

Hi. Is Valerie there?

VALERIE:
I'm over here.

07:38.657 --> 07:41.125
Uh, it was
a rhetorical question. Bye.

07:41.126 --> 07:43.728
Valerie?

07:43.729 --> 07:45.829
How'd you get
in my house?

07:45.830 --> 07:47.831
It was weird. Someone slipped
a key under the door,

07:47.832 --> 07:49.533
but no one was home
but your cat.

07:49.534 --> 07:51.568
Oh, yeah,
my cat let you in.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.771
Anyway, you're here because...?

07:53.772 --> 07:55.439
Because I can't go
back to school.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.941
I'm so embarrassed.

07:56.942 --> 07:58.876
I keep replaying
the whole ugly thing

07:58.877 --> 08:00.544
over and over in my mind.

08:00.545 --> 08:02.680
There are so many
unanswered questions.

08:02.681 --> 08:05.916
Why a burp? Why with Justin?
Why at school?

08:05.917 --> 08:07.418
Why my closet?

08:07.419 --> 08:09.219
Because I feel safe here,
Sabrina.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.422
Look, every morning
I'll pretend to go to school,

08:11.423 --> 08:14.124
hide here all day
and relive the incident

08:14.125 --> 08:16.927
as I rock back and forth
in the dark.

08:16.928 --> 08:18.963
That sounds like a fun solution
to your problem.

Thank you, Sabrina.

08:27.839 --> 08:29.840
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

08:29.841 --> 08:32.543
I need to remove a crank
from my butt.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.246
I need an anti-embarrassment
spell to help Valerie.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.881
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
There is no such spell.

08:37.883 --> 08:39.784
The only way to get rid
of embarrassment

08:39.784 --> 08:41.318
is to just ride it out.

08:41.318 --> 08:44.355
Or put poison
in the town's reservoir.

08:45.490 --> 08:46.791
Just a suggestion.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.759
I'm sorry, Sabrina.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.361
It's one of life's lessons

08:50.362 --> 08:52.963
and even witches can't tamper
with life's lessons.

08:52.964 --> 08:54.231
I want to live in a world

08:54.232 --> 08:56.667
where you can escape your
problems and not learn anything.

09:03.275 --> 09:05.409
Hilda,

09:05.410 --> 09:08.112
I should never have asked
you to dry my ears.

09:08.113 --> 09:09.380
You don't hang ears.

09:09.381 --> 09:11.548
You reshape them
and dry them flat.

09:11.549 --> 09:13.684
Sorry. I was never good
at laundry.

09:13.685 --> 09:14.885
Come on. You're young.

09:14.886 --> 09:18.122
They'll shrink back...
in a day or so.

09:18.123 --> 09:20.090
I hope so because I have
a date Friday night,

09:20.091 --> 09:21.458
and I can't wear these.

09:21.459 --> 09:24.395
SALEM:
You know, I feel
another song coming on.

09:24.396 --> 09:26.931
¶ Do your ears hang low? ¶

09:26.932 --> 09:28.465
¶ Do they wobble to and fro? ¶

09:28.466 --> 09:30.468
¶ Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them--? ¶

09:30.469 --> 09:32.970
Oh, wait,
this is my fault.

09:32.971 --> 09:35.840
You're a good friend.
Thanks for standing by me.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.374
Of course
I'd stand by you.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.145
I've never seen so much
laughing, mocking, name-calling.

09:41.146 --> 09:43.781
I think
you've had enough.

09:43.782 --> 09:45.549
Look, you can hang out here
as long as you want,

09:45.550 --> 09:47.417
but I'm going
to get back to work

09:47.418 --> 09:49.220
on our jet propulsion project.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.889
Oh, I completely forgot
our project's due tomorrow.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.524
That's okay.
I don't need any sleep.

09:53.525 --> 09:55.326
Look, I can't dump
that whole thing on you.

09:55.327 --> 09:57.194
What? We're gonna do
a satellite feed from my room?

09:57.195 --> 10:00.665
No. I'll just have to face
that one class for you.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.266
You'd do that for me?

10:02.267 --> 10:03.801
Well, you're sharing
your room with me.

10:03.802 --> 10:06.637
Hey, by the way, can I borrow
this weird, jeweled book?

10:06.638 --> 10:08.806
No! Mine!

10:08.807 --> 10:11.676
Oh, that's right.
You're an only child.

10:13.178 --> 10:15.112
Uh, yes, Dr. Werner.

10:15.113 --> 10:16.648
May I call you Jean?

10:16.649 --> 10:18.949
Okay. So, Dr. Werner,

10:18.950 --> 10:21.084
I know you don't
normally make house calls,

10:21.085 --> 10:23.254
but it would really help
Salem's recovery

10:23.255 --> 10:25.956
if you could come by
and smother him with kisses.

10:25.957 --> 10:27.057
Salem, get off the phone.

10:29.361 --> 10:30.828
Valerie's such
a great friend.

10:30.829 --> 10:32.697
She's gonna face school
just for me.

10:32.698 --> 10:33.831
You got me off the phone

10:33.832 --> 10:36.467
with the future Mrs. Saberhagen
for that?

10:36.468 --> 10:38.101
Do you think there's any way
I could help her

10:38.102 --> 10:39.703
get rid of her embarrassment?

10:39.704 --> 10:41.405
Well, there is a spell.

10:41.406 --> 10:42.740
Not according to my aunts.

10:42.741 --> 10:44.308
For one teensy kiss

10:44.309 --> 10:45.843
I'll let you in
on the little-known fact

10:45.844 --> 10:47.511
that embarrassment
is cross-referenced

10:47.512 --> 10:49.713
in the magic book
under Gerald Ford.

10:49.714 --> 10:51.115
Thanks, Salem.

10:51.116 --> 10:54.118
Wait, I didn't do that right.

10:54.119 --> 10:56.754
"To remove embarrassment,
one must laugh at one's self.

10:56.755 --> 10:59.623
Add a pinch of ha-ha root."

10:59.624 --> 11:02.660
We have it, and yet
we're always out of vanilla.

11:02.661 --> 11:03.961
( root laughing )

11:06.632 --> 11:08.599
A banana peel?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.968
"The embarrassee must slip
on this peel in public

11:10.969 --> 11:12.303
"to remove embarrassment.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.971
"If dissatisfied,

11:13.972 --> 11:16.940
exchange for a seltzer bottle"?

11:16.941 --> 11:18.775
VALERIE:
I feel like everyone's
staring at me.

11:18.776 --> 11:19.943
They're not staring
at you.

11:19.944 --> 11:21.512
They're staring
with you.

11:21.513 --> 11:24.214
Hi, Valerie.
Love your belch.

11:24.215 --> 11:26.883
Heh. I mean, belt.

11:26.884 --> 11:28.019
Just ignore her.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.787
I have a feeling
sometime real soon

11:29.788 --> 11:31.488
we're gonna laugh
about this.

11:31.489 --> 11:33.190
Not in this life.

11:35.326 --> 11:36.393
( yelps )

11:38.063 --> 11:39.630
Come on.
Laugh at yourself.

11:39.631 --> 11:40.965
( chuckling )

11:40.966 --> 11:42.399
Here, let me give you a hand.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.701
Thanks.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.303
Yeah, I'm starting
to look at clown colleges.

11:46.304 --> 11:48.138
You know, Valerie,
about Saturday--

11:48.139 --> 11:50.374
Yes. When I burp,
it means "yes."

11:50.375 --> 11:52.709
When I spit milk
out my nose it means "no."

11:52.710 --> 11:54.578
Great. So I'll
pick you up at 8?

11:54.579 --> 11:55.446
Mm-hm.

11:57.182 --> 11:58.249
Uh, great.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.583
I had banana goo
on my butt

11:59.584 --> 12:01.252
when I was talking
to Justin, didn't I?

12:01.253 --> 12:02.653
Yeah.

12:02.654 --> 12:04.688
Oh, who cares?
We better get to Physics.

12:06.024 --> 12:08.892
And they say you can't
get rid of embarrassment.

12:08.893 --> 12:10.260
It's a classic.

12:10.261 --> 12:12.330
So by definition,
it's the momentum derived

12:12.331 --> 12:14.899
from ejection
of exhaust stream.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.234
Sabrina?
Thank you,
Valerie.

12:17.235 --> 12:19.469
"Another form of jet propulsion
is the rapid flow of gas

12:19.470 --> 12:21.405
from within a propelled body."

12:21.406 --> 12:23.507
( farts )

12:23.508 --> 12:24.641
( snickers )

12:24.642 --> 12:26.877
Oh, the humanity.

12:26.878 --> 12:28.980
Most people just use
visual aids.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.181
I...

12:31.182 --> 12:33.851
"Uh, so, uh, the different
examples of propulsion

12:33.852 --> 12:36.153
are the rocket,
the fanjet--"

12:36.154 --> 12:37.988
Yeah, we could use a fan
right about now.

12:37.989 --> 12:39.090
( all laugh )

12:39.091 --> 12:40.891
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

12:46.197 --> 12:48.766
( students laughing )

12:48.767 --> 12:50.568
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

13:01.847 --> 13:03.481
BOY:
Go, go, go!

13:05.316 --> 13:06.684
Hold me.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.319
SALEM:
Boy, is your face red.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.488
Oh, no!

13:11.489 --> 13:14.358
You cast an anti-embarrassment
spell on Valerie.

13:14.359 --> 13:16.794
Yeah. The one you said
didn't exist.

13:16.795 --> 13:20.298
Honey, did it ever occur
to you just to listen to us?

13:20.299 --> 13:21.732
The cat said...

13:21.733 --> 13:23.467
You can't get rid
of embarrassment.

13:23.468 --> 13:25.435
You can only
displace it.

13:25.436 --> 13:27.371
It's left Valerie
and been transferred to you

13:27.372 --> 13:29.073
since you cast
the spell.

13:29.074 --> 13:33.110
Oops. I blame it on the cone.

13:33.111 --> 13:35.679
Oh, honey, you got a little
spinach in your teeth.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.615
That's the least of it.

13:37.616 --> 13:40.884
You don't know
the embarrassment I've seen!

13:40.885 --> 13:45.222
Oh, Sabrina, everyone has
embarrassing moments.

13:45.223 --> 13:47.424
It's happened
throughout history.

13:47.425 --> 13:49.893
Even the most famous people
have lived through humiliation,

13:49.894 --> 13:52.596
but that's not what
they're remembered for.

13:52.597 --> 13:54.431
Let's roll tape.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.669
NARRATOR ( over TV ):

13:58.670 --> 14:01.872
<i>Queen Victoria greets</i>
<i>her loyal subjects.</i>

14:06.511 --> 14:10.514
<i>On this fateful day</i>
<i>not even Camelot was Camelot.</i>

14:10.515 --> 14:12.349
( fabric rips )

14:12.350 --> 14:16.153
Guinevere, avert your eyes.

14:16.154 --> 14:18.122
<i>We declared our independence</i>
<i>but not without a fight.</i>

14:18.123 --> 14:19.257
Hancock!

14:19.258 --> 14:22.159
You had to show off with the K.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.262
Better order dinner. Now we've
got some real writing to do.

14:25.263 --> 14:28.599
<i>The master da Vinci suffers</i>
<i>for his art.</i>

14:28.600 --> 14:29.866
( burps )

14:29.867 --> 14:32.470
<i>And that's</i> Historical Moments
Not in History.

14:32.471 --> 14:35.273
See? And they were all
remembered for their greatness.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.373
( doorbell rings )

14:36.374 --> 14:39.109
But none of them were
in high school.

14:39.110 --> 14:42.446
Sabrina, I have to talk to you.
Valerie, I know why you're here.

14:42.447 --> 14:44.147
To try to talk me
into going back to school.

14:44.148 --> 14:46.016
No! Don't go back.
You can't go back.

14:46.017 --> 14:47.584
The laughter is deafening.

14:47.585 --> 14:48.952
Look, even if you change
your identity

14:48.953 --> 14:50.887
and became a brunette,
they'd find you.

14:50.888 --> 14:52.656
Look, I shouldn't even be here.

14:52.657 --> 14:53.991
Trust no one.

14:56.761 --> 14:59.129
There's nowhere to go.
There's nowhere to hide.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.333
There's gotta be
somewhere to hide.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.536
Let's see, I've got a bedroom,
a bathroom, a vortex...

15:05.537 --> 15:06.803
Wait a minute.

15:11.609 --> 15:13.510
( <i>tropical music playing</i> )

15:13.511 --> 15:14.879
Wow, this is great.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.781
I should have got embarrassed
last summer.

15:18.483 --> 15:19.749
Can I get you something?

15:19.750 --> 15:21.385
Yeah, I'd like one
of those pretty drinks

15:21.386 --> 15:22.419
with the umbrellas in it,

15:22.420 --> 15:24.388
and throw in a cherry,
my good man.

15:24.389 --> 15:26.090
The best fruit smoothie
in the Other Realm

15:26.091 --> 15:27.658
coming right up.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.961
SABRINA:
<i>"Dear Valerie,</i>
<i>hello from the islands.</i>

15:30.962 --> 15:33.364
<i>Wish you were here. I've</i>
<i>told you too much already."</i>

15:33.365 --> 15:35.098
So where you from?

15:35.099 --> 15:37.101
You look like a girl
with a story.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.835
No story.
I'm not escaping from anything.

15:38.836 --> 15:41.772
You been here before?
You look familiar.

15:41.773 --> 15:42.707
Impossible.

15:44.776 --> 15:46.410
Hey, you're Sabrina.

15:46.411 --> 15:47.978
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:47.979 --> 15:49.613
No, no, no, no. No, no.

15:49.614 --> 15:51.048
You're Sabrina. Hey, hey.

15:51.049 --> 15:53.517
Hey, look, everyone.
It's Sabrina.

15:53.518 --> 15:55.286
( all laugh )

15:55.287 --> 15:58.622
And it happened in front
of the whole class.

15:58.623 --> 16:00.490
( all laughing )

16:00.491 --> 16:03.126
It's a perfectly normal
bodily function.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.705
So been to
the Other Realm islands?

16:14.706 --> 16:16.040
How'd you know?

16:16.041 --> 16:17.741
Hilda and I spent
puberty there.

16:17.742 --> 16:19.409
I was a redhead.

16:19.410 --> 16:20.444
But how did they know?

16:20.445 --> 16:22.179
Witches are always
scouring the globe,

16:22.180 --> 16:23.580
looking for a good laugh.

16:23.581 --> 16:25.949
Although we just don't
get British humor.

16:25.950 --> 16:28.819
I guess I'm just going
to have to face my fate.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.987
Homeschooling.

16:29.988 --> 16:32.656
Oh, honey, running away
never solves anything.

16:32.657 --> 16:34.024
You will get through this.

16:34.025 --> 16:36.593
Yeah. You just have to look
at the big picture.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.364
At any given moment,

16:40.365 --> 16:42.700
high-school students
all across the country

16:42.701 --> 16:45.001
are doing
something embarrassing.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.570
Yeah,
but did all those people...?

16:47.939 --> 16:49.106
I can't even say it.

16:50.709 --> 16:51.942
Cheese?

16:53.244 --> 16:54.511
Oh.

16:54.512 --> 16:56.747
( laughing )

16:56.748 --> 16:58.949
You what?

17:00.785 --> 17:03.253
Whoa. That is the queen mother
of embarrassment.

17:03.254 --> 17:04.655
Well...

17:04.656 --> 17:06.890
I can teach her music,
and, Zelly, you can teach--

17:06.891 --> 17:09.627
Come on, it doesn't matter
what happened.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.228
Life goes on,
and eventually

17:11.229 --> 17:13.762
everything becomes
yesterday's news.

17:13.763 --> 17:15.965
In the meantime,
try not to worry too much

17:15.967 --> 17:17.701
about what
other people think.

17:17.702 --> 17:19.502
But if I don't worry
about what other people think,

17:19.503 --> 17:21.371
what will they say?

17:21.372 --> 17:23.574
Trust me.
It's gonna be okay.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.544
Oh, I forgot to call
and postpone my date with Frank.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.613
Why? You're not embarrassed
about your ears, are you?

17:29.614 --> 17:31.348
Well, of course not. I--

17:31.349 --> 17:33.850
I just felt I should
be here with you.

17:33.851 --> 17:36.086
Well, I'm fine,
and I have Aunt Hilda.

17:36.087 --> 17:37.621
Well, then, okay.

17:37.622 --> 17:40.623
I guess I'll...
keep my date.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.793
I wouldn't
wear earrings.

17:42.794 --> 17:46.796
SALEM:
Somebody?
I'm stuck cone down.

17:46.797 --> 17:49.133
Take me to Dr. Werner's. Stat.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.267
I'll take you.

17:50.268 --> 17:51.635
I'm the only member
of this family

17:51.636 --> 17:52.802
who can still go out
in public.

17:52.803 --> 17:54.305
( Salem sobs )

17:54.306 --> 17:57.841
I do not like this laceration
at the base of his tail.

17:57.842 --> 18:00.611
Unfortunately,
I think we need to shave him.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.213
Well, we want
what's best for Salem,

18:02.214 --> 18:04.415
even if it does mean
a bare bottom.

18:04.416 --> 18:08.018
SALEM:
<i>But the beautiful doctor</i>
<i>will see my popo.</i>

18:10.155 --> 18:11.488
Yes, I've been
working for weeks

18:11.489 --> 18:13.089
on molecular cohesion,

18:13.090 --> 18:15.091
but it's just
not coming together.

18:15.092 --> 18:18.796
Zelda, you're so witty,
so intelligent,

18:18.797 --> 18:20.197
and so lovely.
Oh.

18:20.198 --> 18:23.801
I just want to whisper
sweet nothings in your ear.

18:23.802 --> 18:26.102
( screaming )

18:26.103 --> 18:29.707
So tell me about your work.

18:29.708 --> 18:30.874
SABRINA:
Well,

18:30.875 --> 18:33.210
I guess I'm ready
to face school.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.579
On second thought...

18:37.215 --> 18:40.351
Ah, this is a snugly place
to wait out adolescence.

18:40.352 --> 18:41.651
Come on, Sabrina, get up.

18:41.652 --> 18:44.755
You're gonna be late,
and I want the warm bed.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.891
I'm not going. I can't possibly
be yesterday's news yet.

18:47.892 --> 18:49.426
Come on, you're a witch.

18:49.427 --> 18:52.763
Use your magic to make other
people do embarrassing things.

18:52.764 --> 18:55.833
You can be
yesterday's news today.

18:55.834 --> 18:58.935
Something's wrong. This is kind
of making sense to me.

18:58.936 --> 19:01.638
You bet it makes sense.
Now how 'bout a thank-you kiss?

19:01.639 --> 19:04.008
They keep saying how everyone
has embarrassing moments,

19:04.009 --> 19:05.909
so I would just be helping
things along, right?

19:05.910 --> 19:07.878
Don't rationalize, mobilize.

19:07.879 --> 19:09.680
You've got to save yourself.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.681
You're right.
It's a jungle out there.

19:11.682 --> 19:14.084
Survival of the fittest. I'm not
going down without a fight.

19:14.085 --> 19:15.886
Okay, you're pumped.
Now go to school.

19:15.887 --> 19:17.687
Thanks, Salem.
Hey, I owed you one.

19:17.688 --> 19:19.189
I really appreciate
your covering

19:19.190 --> 19:21.658
my shaved behind
with these nice pants.

19:21.659 --> 19:22.792
I only did it 'cause the sight

19:22.793 --> 19:24.727
of your chicken skin
was making me sick.

19:24.728 --> 19:28.064
Glad I didn't bother
to write a thank-you note.

19:28.065 --> 19:30.701
( <i>melancholy theme playing</i> )

19:30.702 --> 19:32.202
( indistinct chatter )

19:32.203 --> 19:33.603
GIRL:
Look at her.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.141
Well, time to become
yesterday's news.

19:38.142 --> 19:39.809
Sabrina, you're here.

19:39.810 --> 19:41.611
HARVEY:
Ooh, I hate to say this,

19:41.612 --> 19:43.813
but the red face
isn't much of a disguise.

19:43.814 --> 19:45.081
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll work on it.

19:45.082 --> 19:47.284
SABRINA:
<i>Okay, where's my first victim?</i>

19:47.285 --> 19:50.320
<i>Aha! Get ready to become</i>
<i>a human dribble-glass.</i>

19:50.321 --> 19:51.821
<i>Nah.</i>

19:54.692 --> 19:57.627
<i>Ooh. One uncontrollable</i>
<i>runny nose coming right up.</i>

19:57.628 --> 19:59.196
Do it.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.367
Kiss, kiss.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.068
( <i>Sabrina groans</i> )

20:05.069 --> 20:07.404
<i>Let's see you try flirting</i>
<i>with bad breath.</i>

20:09.507 --> 20:12.375
I can't. I'll just ride it out
like everyone else.

20:13.778 --> 20:15.846
Hey, Sabrina.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.214
Sorry you got humiliated
the other day,

20:17.215 --> 20:19.116
but at least I finally
got a day off.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.551
I'm glad I could help.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.719
You know, I always used
to think you were so perfect,

20:22.720 --> 20:24.621
almost like you
weren't human,

20:24.622 --> 20:26.923
but turns out
you're just one of us.

20:26.924 --> 20:29.125
Yeah, I guess I am.

20:33.898 --> 20:37.567
Oh, well, I guess this doesn't
have any magic anymore.

20:37.568 --> 20:39.035
LIBBY:
This is for the football team.

20:39.036 --> 20:41.271
Out of my way. Ooh!

20:43.742 --> 20:45.975
Laugh.
Split a gut.

20:50.981 --> 20:52.816
Well, everyone's
back to normal.

20:52.817 --> 20:54.652
My face, Salem's behind,

20:54.653 --> 20:56.654
Aunt Zelda's ears,
Aunt Hilda...

20:56.655 --> 20:58.489
Well, someday.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.656
( laughs )

20:59.657 --> 21:00.457
You're grounded.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.060
Hello.

21:03.061 --> 21:05.829
Salem, I bet it feels good
to get rid of that cone, huh?

21:05.830 --> 21:07.798
Oh, you're such
a good kitty.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.266
Come here, little guy.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.700
SALEM:
<i>This is it.</i>

21:10.701 --> 21:13.137
<i>I'm gonna be a big guy.</i>

21:13.138 --> 21:15.705
( <i>romantic theme playing</i> )

21:18.309 --> 21:19.576
Nothing happened!

21:19.577 --> 21:21.978
That stupid, stupid camel.

21:24.381 --> 21:25.816
Salem, have you lost
your mind?

21:25.817 --> 21:28.118
Ah, she'll wake up
and think she's just overworked

21:28.119 --> 21:29.753
and needs a vacation.

21:29.754 --> 21:32.789
Maybe the spell will work
if I kiss her.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.958
( sobbing )

21:34.959 --> 21:37.160
Guess it's time
to change vets again.
