00:53.428 --> 00:56.639
I said to McDermott, "I didn't
think you were gonna do it that minute."

00:56.723 --> 00:59.350
He said it was better to get it done with.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.478
Then he came to me and said,

01:01.561 --> 01:03.980
"Open the trap door
and I'll throw her down the cellar."

01:04.064 --> 01:06.107
I refused to do so, being frightened.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.861
He presently came to me and said
he had thrown her down the cellar...

01:11.154 --> 01:12.781
I asked him what for.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.492
He said,
"Never mind, she's not dead yet."

01:15.575 --> 01:19.204
I gave him a piece of white cloth
and followed him to the trap door.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.873
I saw the body lying
at the foot of the stairs...

01:40.642 --> 01:43.978
"Nancy was
on the cellar floor, barely alive.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.647
I turned to Grace.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.275
Her livid face was even more dreadful
than that of the unfortunate woman.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.489
She uttered no cry, but she put her hand
to her head, and said..."

01:54.572 --> 01:57.534
-God has damned me for this.
-Then you have nothing more to fear.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.912
Give me that handkerchief off your neck.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.794
"She gave it to me without a word.

02:07.877 --> 02:11.339
I tied the handkerchief round her throat
in a single tie,

02:13.383 --> 02:14.968
...giving Grace one end to hold,

02:15.051 --> 02:18.304
while I drew the other tight enough
to finish my terrible work.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.349
Her eyes literally started from her head.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.686
She gave one groan, and all was over.

02:48.668 --> 02:52.297
I then cut the body in four pieces
and turned a large washtub over on them."

03:09.772 --> 03:11.566
I feel I have not learned anything

03:11.649 --> 03:14.068
other than that I have not yet
learned anything.

03:14.152 --> 03:18.573
Yes. She does challenge
a man's mental capacities.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.825
What part of her story
is she telling you now?

03:20.909 --> 03:23.411
-We are approaching the center.
-The center?

03:23.494 --> 03:26.331
We are retracing, day by day,
hour by hour,

03:26.414 --> 03:28.666
the events which immediately
preceded the murders.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.044
Anything she says now could be a clue.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.129
Any gesture, any twitch.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.423
She knows.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.634
She might not know she knows, but...

03:39.177 --> 03:41.221
buried deep within her,
the knowledge is there.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.474
Then you can't afford to lose
hold of the thread you've been following.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.604
Find a new living situation.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.022
I beg your pardon, Reverend?

03:51.105 --> 03:54.400
If it becomes known that you are living
alone with your landlady,

03:54.484 --> 03:56.027
your reputation...

03:56.986 --> 04:00.823
The Tories are merciless
in the persecution of their enemies

04:00.907 --> 04:03.493
and were all for hanging her.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.120
I have been somewhat preoccupied.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.248
Doctor?

04:08.331 --> 04:09.749
Something she...

04:11.584 --> 04:13.169
something I'm on the verge of remembering.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.173
And I... There is something she said
about a whisper...

04:19.133 --> 04:21.803
and a man in the night.
I'm trying to remember.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.722
Get some sleep, Dr. Jordan.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.199
What is it?

04:43.825 --> 04:49.664
Dr. Jordan, I am so sorry to disturb you,
but I heard a noise.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.583
I didn't hear any...

04:55.878 --> 04:57.922
This must stop.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.759
Nothing is going on so nothing can stop.

05:14.897 --> 05:18.651
Grace, would you be so kind as to serve
more tea when the presentation is over?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.949
I suppose they want their tea served
to them by a celebrated murderess.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.286
You ought to have been cut into slabs
by the doctors

05:28.369 --> 05:29.829
like butchers dressing a carcass.

05:29.912 --> 05:32.707
What was left they'd do in a bundle,
just like a suet pudding,

05:32.790 --> 05:35.752
and left to molder in a dishonored grave.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.712
Dora, please don't talk
to our Grace that way.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.597
I suppose she's afraid of me.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.225
When people are afraid,
they often behave with cruelty.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.478
You don't seem afraid of me, Clarrie.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.189
Afraid of you for rising up
against your master?

05:56.272 --> 05:58.274
Miss Grace,
where do you think I come from?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.611
The young doctor is teaching them all
what he knows out there.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.238
I know more about him
than you would think.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.406
What do you mean?

06:05.490 --> 06:08.242
He likes his things tidy
and he's willing to pay for it.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.703
So I did some work
at his landlady's house yesterday.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.956
Her husband ran off on her, and he seems
to be taking fine care of her.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.626
What sort of woman is she?

06:16.709 --> 06:19.170
She has a wild rolling to the eye
and a twitchy manner.

06:19.253 --> 06:22.173
And those two things together always mean
warm work behind closed doors.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.718
Dr. Jordan better watch himself,
because if I ever saw a determination

06:25.802 --> 06:29.472
to get a man's trousers off him,
it's there in her eyes.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.225
That is quite coarse.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.061
I think it is coarse and unnatural
that they take breakfast together now.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.604
They do?

06:46.280 --> 06:48.908
How to measure the effects of shock.

06:48.991 --> 06:53.955
How to diagnose amnesia with no
discernible physical manifestations

06:54.038 --> 06:57.917
or certain inexplicable and radical parts
of the personality.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.213
There are those who have dedicated
themselves to the study of hysterics

07:02.296 --> 07:06.425
and the investigation of dreams
as a key to diagnosis,

07:06.509 --> 07:08.219
and their relation to amnesia,

07:08.302 --> 07:12.390
which I myself hope in time
to make a modest contribution.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.230
I must confess, the last few weeks

07:19.313 --> 07:22.692
have shaken my confidence
in the ability of...

07:23.818 --> 07:25.945
even the most experienced doctor

07:26.028 --> 07:30.116
to make the connection between
dreams and diagnosis.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.207
Thank you so much, Dr. Jordan.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.251
My pleasure.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.675
Illuminating, but somewhat contentious.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.554
I'm not certain there is room for the soul
in your theory.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.806
And that could be dangerous.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.894
-They'll be wanting more tea soon.
-It will be a moment.

07:59.729 --> 08:05.151
Oh, Dr. Jordan, I would like to introduce
you to Dr. Jerome DuPont.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.777
It is a pleasure, Doctor.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.488
-Pleasure.
-And might I say, your lecture

08:08.571 --> 08:11.991
was... very interesting.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.040
There's a voice out there
that sounds familiar.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.169
The man that Dr. Jordan is talking to,
has he been to the house before?

08:23.252 --> 08:26.088
I've never seen him before.
A strange one.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.596
And how is your fair patient,
if I may call her that?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.056
Are you making any progress?

08:35.139 --> 08:36.432
Nothing definitive.

08:36.516 --> 08:40.311
There are several possible lines
of enquiry I hope to follow up.

08:40.394 --> 08:44.440
Well, I would be honored if you would
permit me to use my own method.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.610
As a sort of experiment.
A demonstration, if you like.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.362
I am at a crucial point.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.156
It might upset her
and undo weeks of careful preparation.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.451
At your convenience, of course.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.914
I expect to stay here for another month
and I would be very happy to be of help.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.083
We all feel,
all of us on the committee,

09:02.166 --> 09:06.087
that it would be to our advantage to do
whatever we can to move things along.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.714
I myself am a spiritualist.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.508
We often have evening seances.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.510
- They may be useful.
- No.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.014
I need a little more time.
Too much meddling will ruin everything.

09:17.098 --> 09:22.478
But could Dr. DuPont just attempt one
session of neuro-hypnosis with Miss Marks?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.355
On behalf of the committee.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.190
-Surely, you would have no objection--
-Please.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.484
Give me more time.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.330
Grace.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.250
Grace. Grace.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.296
Some water, please!

09:49.755 --> 09:51.132
- Can we have some water?
- Grace.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.551
Hey.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.265
It's Dr. Jordan.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.393
Are you alright, Grace?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.564
Hello, Grace.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.817
Jere...

10:11.277 --> 10:15.197
I could have laughed with glee,
for Jeremiah had done a conjuring trick,

10:15.281 --> 10:19.535
as surely as if he'd pulled a coin from
my ear, or made believe to swallow a fork.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.871
I'm so sorry. I've dropped all the cakes.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.122
Try to be still, Grace.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.959
And just as he used to do such tricks
in full view,

10:27.043 --> 10:29.837
with everyone looking on
but unable to detect him,

10:29.920 --> 10:32.048
-he had done the same here...
-Miss Marks.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.550
-...and they were none the wiser.
-How do you do?

10:35.843 --> 10:38.137
She's often startled by strangers,
aren't you, Grace?

10:38.220 --> 10:40.848
Dr. DuPont is a friend.
He won't hurt you.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.266
Jerome DuPont.
A medical practitioner.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.227
I must look into her eyes.
It's often the best indication

10:45.311 --> 10:47.563
as to whether or not the procedure
will be efficacious.

10:48.522 --> 10:52.526
Good. Good, very good.
Grace, have you ever been hypnotized?

10:52.610 --> 10:55.946
Please.
Let her recover from her fainting spell.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.782
I should certainly hope not, sir.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.034
I do not even know rightly
what being hypnotized is.

11:00.117 --> 11:04.246
It is an entirely scientific procedure.
Would you be willing to try it?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.418
If it would help your friends,
the committee,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.379
if it were decided by them
that you should.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.383
I'll do everything in my power, sir,
if that's what is wanted.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.927
Good, very good,
but if this is going to work,

11:18.010 --> 11:21.305
you must repose your trust in me.
Do you think you can do that, Grace?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.599
I will try, sir.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.394
I think she's had enough
excitement for one day.

11:27.728 --> 11:31.649
Care must be taken for Grace's nerves.
They're delicate and must not be damaged.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.111
Of course, of course.
We should do this another day.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.070
Thank you.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.624
The next day I was to tell you
about the day

11:48.707 --> 11:51.210
Nancy Montgomery
and Thomas Kinnear were murdered.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.880
I sat up and I thought to myself,

11:56.257 --> 11:59.176
what should I tell Dr. Jordan
about this day?

11:59.927 --> 12:02.012
We are almost there.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.601
I went to the pump, and on turning around,
I saw McDermott dragging Nancy...

12:07.685 --> 12:10.271
I remember what the lawyer, Mr. Mackenzie,
said I should say,

12:10.354 --> 12:12.022
and what I said at the trial.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.607
He presently came to me and said

12:13.691 --> 12:16.068
he had thrown her down the cellar
and wanted a handkerchief.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.237
I asked him what for...

12:19.905 --> 12:22.241
And what I did not say even to him,

12:22.992 --> 12:25.786
and what I said afterwards,
which was different as well.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.249
And what the others said.
Did she say...

12:30.332 --> 12:32.918
Don't think I don't know
what you've been up to.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.088
I will pay you on Saturday
and then you can be gone out of here

12:36.172 --> 12:38.382
and that will be the end of it
and good riddance.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.267
Was I crying?

12:52.563 --> 12:54.315
-Did he say....
-Grace...

12:55.441 --> 12:56.484
why are you crying?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.152
I wish she was dead.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.695
Surely I did not say that.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.490
Or not out loud.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.453
Did I push him away?

13:09.246 --> 13:12.416
-Did he say...
-I will soon make you think better of me.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.090
I will tell you a secret
if you promise to keep it.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.512
And if you do not,
your life will not be worth a straw.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.264
It might have happened.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.644
- Did he say...
- I know you're hiding from me.

13:32.811 --> 13:37.733
Come out at once or I'll have to find you
and catch you,

13:37.816 --> 13:41.862
and once I've got ahold of you,
who knows what I will do?

13:44.198 --> 13:48.285
You never obey me, you never listen to me,
you never do as I say, you dirty girl.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.173
-Did he say...
-Now you will have to be punished.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.301
It might have happened.

14:08.681 --> 14:14.812
You must unlock the door, you must
open the window, you must let me in.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.982
Let... me... in.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.735
Let me in. Open the window. Let me in.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.590
Today I must go on with the story.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.592
Or the story must go on with me,

14:45.342 --> 14:47.052
carrying me inside it,

14:47.136 --> 14:49.805
along the track it must travel,
straight to the end,

14:50.598 --> 14:54.310
weeping like a train, and deaf
and single-eyed and locked tight shut,

14:54.393 --> 14:58.022
although I hurl myself against the walls
of it and scream and cry

14:58.105 --> 15:00.274
and beg God himself to let me out.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.655
I said to McDermott, "I didn't think you
were gonna do it that minute..."

15:06.739 --> 15:09.825
The witness was acquainted
with the deceased.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.912
...claims that the last time
he saw Thomas Kinnear alive

15:12.995 --> 15:15.039
was on the morning of...

15:32.264 --> 15:35.601
-Good morning, Grace.
-Good morning, Dr. Jordan.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.147
Should we pick up where we left off?

15:41.899 --> 15:44.234
Today is the day I must talk about...

15:46.153 --> 15:48.113
I must tell what I did or didn't do.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.953
It is not the question of your guilt
or innocence that concerns me.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.121
I'm a doctor, not a judge.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.792
I simply wish to know what you yourself
can actually remember.

15:59.875 --> 16:04.213
Nobody has cared about that before, sir.
They told me I must be lying.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.923
They kept wanting to know more.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.760
Except for the lawyer, Kenneth Mackenzie.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.887
But I'm sure that even he
did not believe me.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.263
I will believe you.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.482
Mr. Kinnear left for the city
on Thursday, did he not?

16:23.565 --> 16:25.776
-Yes, sir.
-At three o'clock, on horseback?

16:26.777 --> 16:28.028
In his one-horse wagon.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.948
But yes, that was the exact time, sir.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.825
He was to be back on the Friday.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.869
Here's your favorite beau, Grace.
Come kiss him goodbye.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.037
Meaning James McDermott?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.873
But McDermott wasn't going anywhere.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.668
He meant the horse, sir.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.171
He knew I was very fond of Charley.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.466
Grace, stop dawdling!
You're not paid to socialize.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.775
Did Mr. Kinnear make improper advances
to you, Grace?

17:09.153 --> 17:11.613
I don't know what you mean
by improper, sir.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.907
He never used foul language to me.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.160
Did he touch you?
Did he take liberties?

17:16.243 --> 17:18.829
-Only what was usual, sir.
-Usual?

17:18.912 --> 17:20.414
With a servant, sir.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.292
He was kind
and liberal when he wished to be.

17:23.375 --> 17:27.212
Did he put his hands under your clothing?
Were you lying down?

17:28.630 --> 17:30.507
I've heard enough of that kind of talk.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.635
You're just like them at the asylum
with their filthy ideas!

17:33.719 --> 17:35.804
-I don't have to stay here.
-I'm so sorry.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.015
I am terribly sorry.
I shouldn't have asked you that.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.434
Please.
Please accept my humblest apology.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.270
Please sit down.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.774
Please.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.831
Let us go back to the chain of events.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.545
Mr. Kinnear left
at three o'clock on Thursday.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.381
Then what happened?

18:21.225 --> 18:24.520
You're both to leave tomorrow.
I'll pay your wages until now.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.106
Mr. Kinnear...
He is not in agreement with this.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.774
-He's said nothing.
-He is in agreement.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.779
Now I've had enough of your face.
Make yourself scarce until you leave.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.126
I'll be glad when you're gone.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.919
I can hardly wait.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.965
I don't believe Mr. Kinnear
knew a thing about it.

18:53.048 --> 18:58.011
As I said, sir, she was in the family way,
and it often happens like that with a man.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.639
They change from a woman
in that condition to one who is not.

19:00.722 --> 19:04.476
It's the same with cows and horses,
and if that happened,

19:04.560 --> 19:06.979
she'd be out on the road,
her and her bastard.

19:07.062 --> 19:10.649
It was plain she wanted me out of the way
and gone before Mr. Kinnear came home.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.151
And what did you do then?

19:19.324 --> 19:23.036
I imagine she won't pay us our wages
and send us off with no reference.

19:28.417 --> 19:32.880
I have a secret.
You must promise not to tell anyone.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.259
-Promise.
-I'm going to kill Nancy with the axe.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.387
I'm gonna shoot Mr. Kinnear when he
comes back and take the valuables.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.891
You'll help if you know
what's good for you.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.393
Otherwise you'll be blamed for it all.

19:48.061 --> 19:51.190
If I hadn't been so upset, I would
have laughed at him, but I did not.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.861
And to tell the truth, we'd both had
a glass or two of Mr. Kinnear's whisky.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.447
Did you believe McDermott
would do as he said?

19:58.530 --> 19:59.698
Not altogether, sir.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.492
On the one hand,
I thought he was just bragging,

20:02.576 --> 20:04.703
which was a thing
he was prone to when drunk.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.413
My own father was the same way.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.834
But on the other hand, he seemed
in earnest and I was afraid of him.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.129
And I had a strong feeling
as if it was fated,

20:14.213 --> 20:16.423
and it couldn't be avoided,
no matter what I did.

20:16.506 --> 20:20.344
Did you not warn anyone?
Nancy herself?

20:21.345 --> 20:23.555
And why would she have believed me, sir?

20:23.639 --> 20:26.516
It would have sounded too stupid
if I said it out loud.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.937
There was only my word for it,
which he could easily deny

20:30.020 --> 20:32.898
and say that I was
nothing but a silly hysterical girl.

20:32.981 --> 20:37.069
At the same time, if he meant it, he might
have killed us both right there and then,

20:37.152 --> 20:39.071
and I did not want to be killed.

20:40.656 --> 20:44.993
The best I could do was try to delay him
until Mr. Kinnear came back.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.080
At first he said he was going to do it
that very night,

20:48.163 --> 20:49.706
and I persuaded him not to.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.874
How did you manage that?

20:50.958 --> 20:53.377
I said that if Nancy was killed
on the Thursday,

20:53.460 --> 20:56.296
that would mean a whole day
of having to account for her whereabouts

20:56.380 --> 20:58.048
to anyone who might enquire.

20:58.131 --> 21:01.802
Whereas if he left it till later, there
would be less suspicion aroused.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.054
I see.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.348
Very sensible.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.894
Please don't make fun of me, sir.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.772
It's very distressing to me,

21:13.855 --> 21:16.149
and doubly so considering
what I'm being asked to remember.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.026
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.488
And then what happened?

21:24.283 --> 21:27.327
Nancy came back into the kitchen
as if nothing had happened.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.664
It was always her way
when she was in a temper,

21:30.747 --> 21:33.959
to pretend as if nothing had happened
and we were all the best of friends.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.420
Look at you two,
enjoying the whisky without me.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.088
Let's put out supper as well.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.611
Grace, will you sleep with me tonight?

22:01.695 --> 22:03.530
I'm afraid of burglars.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.033
Let me get my nightdress.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.873
I am going to kill Nancy tonight.
While she is asleep.

22:12.956 --> 22:16.168
Do not do that.
You might hit me by mistake.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.378
I don't want her looking at me
when I do it.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.266
His bed is bigger
and cooler in the warm weather.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.685
And you have a habit of kicking
in your sleep.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.980
He won't find it out.

22:37.439 --> 22:42.152
And even if he did, he'd like the idea
of two maid-servants in his bed at once.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.988
Nancy, McDermott wants to kill you.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.618
I should imagine he does.
I wouldn't mind killing him either.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.162
-He's in earnest.
-He's never in earnest.

22:52.245 --> 22:55.832
He's always bragging and boasting.
It's all just air.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.434
Then there's nothing
I can do to save you.

23:42.420 --> 23:46.174
The window. Fly out the window.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.063
Mary was lost to me once more.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.233
And still I had not let her soul out.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.186
You dreamt that before the event?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.564
Yes, sir. And many times since.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.905
That is why they put me away.

24:50.822 --> 24:51.823
Away?

24:51.907 --> 24:54.242
Into the asylum, sir.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.620
Because of the bad dreams.

24:57.704 --> 24:58.955
Only the dreams?

25:00.707 --> 25:03.084
Only they said they were
not dreams at all, sir.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.504
They said I was awake.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.391
I do not wish to say any more about it.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.311
Alright, Grace. Just continue on.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.522
Perhaps we will come back
to the dreams later.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.203
-Where's Nancy?
-She's probably dressing now.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.664
-Are you going to kill her this morning?
-Yes.

25:40.747 --> 25:43.792
Damn her. I'm gonna take the axe
and knock her on the head.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.754
Surely you will not.
Surely you can't do such a wicked thing.

25:48.588 --> 25:52.217
You think I am a coward?
You will see in a minute what I can do.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.261
For God's sake, don't kill her
in the bedroom.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.221
You'll make the floor all bloody.

25:58.431 --> 25:59.474
What did you say?

26:01.518 --> 26:05.730
It was a foolish thing to say,
but that is what came into my mind.

26:06.606 --> 26:09.401
And it was my job to clean the floors
in that house,

26:09.484 --> 26:11.611
and there was a carpet in Nancy's room.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.655
I'd never tried to get blood
out of a carpet,

26:13.738 --> 26:17.242
but I got it out of other things,
and it's not a task to be sneezed at.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.877
After that I can remember
no more for a time.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.254
Nothing about the cellar?

27:11.338 --> 27:14.382
Nothing about seeing McDermott
dragging Nancy by the trap door

27:14.466 --> 27:16.051
and throwing her down the stairs?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.261
It's in your confession.

27:53.088 --> 27:57.050
That is what they wanted me to say.
The lawyer.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.928
Mr. Mackenzie, he said I had to say it,
to save my own life.

28:00.011 --> 28:03.556
He said it was not a lie, as that
is what must have happened,

28:03.640 --> 28:05.558
whether I could remember it or not.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.940
Did you give James McDermott
the kerchief from around your neck?

28:13.483 --> 28:15.693
The one that was used
to strangle poor Nancy?

28:18.571 --> 28:21.241
It was mine, I know that.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.286
But I have no recollection
of giving it to him.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.496
Nor of being in the cellar?

28:27.247 --> 28:29.707
Nor of helping him to kill her,
nor of wanting to steal

28:29.791 --> 28:32.419
the gold earrings from her corpse,
which he says you wished to do?

28:32.502 --> 28:34.129
All that time is dark to me.

28:38.007 --> 28:40.635
In any case,
there were no gold earrings taken.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.931
I won't say I didn't think of it later,
when we were packing up.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.435
But having a thought
is not the same as doing it.

28:50.061 --> 28:54.524
If we were all on trial for our thoughts,
we would all be hanged.

28:57.318 --> 29:00.780
Well then,
what is the next thing you can remember?

29:08.580 --> 29:12.751
I know you will tell, and if you do,
your life is not worth a straw.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.296
-What have you done?
-You know very well.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.550
You're going to help me kill him.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.512
- Good gracious, McDermott, it is too soon.
- You're gonna help me.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.229
Hello, Grace.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.522
Where's Nancy?

29:35.231 --> 29:36.983
She went to town in the stagecoach.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.028
That is strange. I passed it on the way
and did not see her.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.447
-Would you like something to eat?
-I'd like to show you

29:42.530 --> 29:43.990
the new saddle, Mr. Kinnear.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.366
It's in the stables.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.472
- Open the trap door.
- I won't.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.891
You shall. Grace!

30:26.032 --> 30:27.784
I must have fainted from fear,

30:27.867 --> 30:31.079
because that is all I can remember
until much later in the evening.

30:31.162 --> 30:34.666
Jamie Walsh testified that he came
into the yard about eight o'clock,

30:34.749 --> 30:36.376
which must have been after you fainted.

30:36.459 --> 30:39.170
He said McDermott was still
holding the gun in his hand

30:39.254 --> 30:41.089
and claimed to have been
shooting birds.

30:41.923 --> 30:42.924
I know it, sir.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.302
He said you were standing by the pump.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.180
He said you told him that
Mr. Kinnear was not back yet

30:49.264 --> 30:51.516
and that Nancy had gone to see
some friends.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.310
I cannot account for it, sir.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.438
He said you were in good spirits.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.775
He said you were better dressed than usual
and were wearing white stockings.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.945
He implied they were Nancy's.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.613
James Walsh,

31:05.697 --> 31:08.825
a witness who was acquainted
with the deceased,

31:08.908 --> 31:12.328
claims that the last time
he saw Thomas Kinnear alive

31:12.412 --> 31:17.166
was on the morning of Thursday, July 27,
at about eleven o'clock,

31:17.250 --> 31:21.254
within two miles of his own house,
on his way from town.

31:22.255 --> 31:25.550
By then he had forgot all of
his former loving sentiments towards me

31:27.051 --> 31:30.555
and only wished to damage me,
and have me hanged if possible.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.019
But there is nothing I can do about
what other people say.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.240
Jamie's testimony was the end of me.

32:01.336 --> 32:05.840
The sentence is death by hanging.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.435
I could show you the scar.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.372
Well, Grace, I can see you're tired.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.375
We will continue with your story tomorrow.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.627
Yes, sir.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.420
I hope I will have the strength.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.257
Sooner or later,
we will get to the bottom of it.

32:48.341 --> 32:49.634
I hope so, sir.

32:50.927 --> 32:56.265
It would be a relief to me, sir,
to know the whole truth at last.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.393
What were you expecting today
that you didn't get?

33:40.476 --> 33:44.981
The missing memory, of course.
Those few crucial hours.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.524
Has she refused to talk?

33:46.607 --> 33:48.943
She has told me a great deal.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.695
But only what she's chosen to tell.

33:50.778 --> 33:55.199
What I want is what she refuses to tell,
what she chooses to perhaps not even know.

33:55.283 --> 33:58.161
Do you mean knowledge of guilt?
Or of innocence?

33:58.244 --> 33:59.620
Either could be concealed.

33:59.704 --> 34:03.791
-She could be a true amnesiac.
-That is our strong feeling on the matter.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.796
Or she could be simply guilty.

34:10.381 --> 34:12.592
She could be insane

34:12.675 --> 34:15.219
with the devious plausibility
of the experienced maniac.

34:17.513 --> 34:22.185
Perhaps...
and I say this with delicacy...

34:22.268 --> 34:26.564
perhaps we should consider Jerome DuPont's
neuro-hypnotic experiment.

34:26.647 --> 34:29.442
-No. I distrust the method.
-Under your guidance, of course.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.070
I see that you want her pardoned
as much as we do.

34:34.864 --> 34:38.534
We need this report
to be favorable to Grace Marks

34:38.618 --> 34:41.079
if we want her pardoned.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.417
Dark.

34:55.009 --> 34:58.262
We then commenced packing up
all the valuable things we could find.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.662
We both went down into the cellar.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.168
Mr. Kinnear was lying on his back
in the cellar.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.878
I held the candle.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.464
McDermott took the keys
and some money from his pockets.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.591
Nothing was said about Nancy.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.096
Around eleven o'clock,
we started off for Toronto.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.474
We will go to the States
and I will marry you.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.486
Oh no.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.072
Oh, no no no.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.080
I have to go to Toronto. For work.

37:29.163 --> 37:32.041
-Please. Please don't.
-Please, I must.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.011
You didn't come today, Dr. Jordan.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.305
So I must go on
with the story without you.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.183
I must prepare what I will tell you
when you return.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.397
There is, of course,
James McDermott's version.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.160
He said I was pleased to see him.

38:10.663 --> 38:14.458
He said we drank a shot of whisky
to steady us and clinked our glasses

38:14.542 --> 38:16.752
and drank to the success of our venture.

38:17.795 --> 38:21.799
I could not have acted so heartlessly
with Mr. Kinnear lying dead in the cellar.

38:21.882 --> 38:25.094
Not to mention Nancy,
who must have been dead too.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.930
But McDermott was a great liar.

38:29.348 --> 38:31.559
What I remember is waking up
to a beautiful night.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.520
I was in Nancy's clothes.

38:36.147 --> 38:40.401
And I looked up at the sky, which seemed
so close I could touch it.

38:40.484 --> 38:46.032
I thought the sky was only a thin surface,
like paper, and it was being singed away.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.868
And behind it was a cold blackness.

38:48.951 --> 38:53.497
And it was not Heaven or even Hell
that I was looking at, but only emptiness.

38:54.206 --> 38:57.084
This was more frightening
than anything I could think of

38:57.168 --> 39:00.379
and I prayed silently to God
to forgive my sins.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.766
But what if there were no God
to forgive me?

39:13.684 --> 39:17.021
And then I reflected that perhaps it was
the outer darkness,

39:17.104 --> 39:20.316
with the wailing and the gnashing
of teeth, where God was not.

39:24.111 --> 39:27.990
What do you mean, causing such an uproar?
Do you want us to be discovered?

39:29.742 --> 39:32.161
Get off. Let me up at once.

39:32.244 --> 39:33.788
You asked me to stop the wagon!

39:33.871 --> 39:37.541
You invited me onto your shawl
like the hot bitch you are.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.543
I did no such thing.
I was sound asleep!

39:39.627 --> 39:42.922
I will not be made a fool of,
you demon slut, you led me on.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.466
You enticed me...

39:46.801 --> 39:49.637
and caused me to damn my soul
into the bargain,

39:50.262 --> 39:51.555
forcing me to kill those two.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.646
Crocodile tears
will not avail you this time.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.066
I have had a bellyful.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.199
You bit me, you whore!

40:18.958 --> 40:21.293
So you are a good girl after all.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.719
I'll wait until I've married you.
It's more proper.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.640
I was just testing you.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.484
Here. We'll have breakfast
before the ferry leaves.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.905
-I'm starved with hunger.
-It's 5 a.m. They won't be awake.

40:49.989 --> 40:52.116
We will rouse them
and make them cook us breakfast.

40:52.199 --> 40:55.369
We should wait until people are about.
Otherwise we will be noticeable.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.831
Why must you always be arguing with me?

40:59.665 --> 41:02.209
I've got money
which is as good as the next man's.

41:02.668 --> 41:07.590
If I want a breakfast and I can
pay for it, then I will have it.

41:13.512 --> 41:17.475
It is remarkable, I have since thought,
how once a man has a few coins,

41:17.558 --> 41:21.437
no matter how he came by them, he thinks
right away he is entitled to them,

41:21.520 --> 41:24.982
and to whatever they can buy,
and fancies himself cock of the walk.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.860
My egg is not cooked enough!

41:29.236 --> 41:32.198
Take it back to the kitchen
and make me another.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.078
Are those Mr. Kinnear's boots?

41:38.162 --> 41:39.914
Did you take them off the body?

41:39.997 --> 41:41.624
Yes.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.460
How could you do such a thing?

41:45.669 --> 41:49.256
What do you mean?
You're wearing Nancy's dress yourself.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.261
It's not the same thing.

41:57.765 --> 42:00.601
I must have left my white kerchief behind.

42:00.684 --> 42:01.977
The one with the blue flowers?

42:02.061 --> 42:03.187
Yes.

42:03.270 --> 42:08.108
I don't know where I left it; I need it
for the ferry to keep the sun off my neck.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.319
It is keeping the sun off Nancy's neck.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.654
You ought to remember,

42:11.737 --> 42:14.240
seeing as you yourself pulled it tight
and tied the knot.

42:15.574 --> 42:19.453
I did not wish to contradict him, as it is
dangerous to contradict mad people.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.913
I forgot.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.667
I'm gonna change my clothes,
because if people come asking for us,

42:24.750 --> 42:26.210
it might throw them off.

42:26.293 --> 42:28.754
I've done all of this for you.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.965
Because you asked me.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.176
Because you said that you would be mine.

42:35.261 --> 42:39.139
We must hang together
or we will hang separately.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.775
I thought I should tell someone.

42:49.858 --> 42:52.611
But there is something despicable
about betrayal.

42:52.695 --> 42:57.283
I'd felt McDermott's heart beating
next to mine, and however undesired,

42:57.366 --> 42:59.368
still it was a human heart.

42:59.451 --> 43:02.121
I did not wish to have any part
in stilling it forever,

43:02.204 --> 43:04.123
unless I should be forced to it.

43:04.206 --> 43:08.252
The Bible says,
"Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord."

43:08.335 --> 43:11.255
I did not feel it was my place to take
such a serious thing

43:11.338 --> 43:13.173
as vengeance into my own hands.

43:13.257 --> 43:16.218
And so I stayed where I was
until he came back.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.444
Pardon me, miss.
What is your name?

43:33.527 --> 43:35.029
Mary Whitney.

43:37.156 --> 43:40.034
-Stop it. We must not arouse suspicion.
-We are in a foreign country now.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.201
We're safe.

43:41.285 --> 43:44.580
That never stopped slavers from seizing
runaway slaves they said were theirs.

43:48.208 --> 43:50.544
We arrived at Lewiston
about three o'clock.

43:52.379 --> 43:54.840
-We'll be married soon enough anyway.
-We will not.

43:54.923 --> 43:56.592
I'd sooner marry the Devil himself
than you.

43:56.675 --> 43:58.260
I'll have my promise off you anyway.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.429
I will scream,
which will be a different thing

44:00.512 --> 44:02.806
in a tavern than in a house
with only two corpses.

44:02.890 --> 44:06.644
For God's sake, shut your mouth, you slut.
You stupid whore.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.813
Think of some new words to use
because I am heartily tired of those.

44:55.442 --> 44:58.654
I told myself they would let me be free
if I told the whole story.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.867
Or as much of it as I could remember.
