00:31.234 --> 00:33.400
(HOOVER HUMMING)

00:37.434 --> 00:39.500
TIM: I'm 30 today.

00:39.567 --> 00:43.801
My mum got me up really early this morning to give me my present.

00:45.934 --> 00:48.467
Yeah, this is it, actually. It's nice.

00:48.534 --> 00:51.300
I'm into... I like ballet. I love the novels of Proust.

00:51.367 --> 00:54.934
I love the work of Alain Delon.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.701
And that's, I think, what influenced her into buying me Hat FM.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.901
I like the radio, too.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.467
Nah, it's all right. It's all right. I think it's quite a sweet present.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.934
I have to make sure Finchy gets here on time for the quiz tonight.

01:11.133 --> 01:12.634
7:00 on the dot.

01:12.701 --> 01:15.868
Six... Six years in a row. Winners.

01:15.934 --> 01:17.701
So, er... You know...

01:17.767 --> 01:20.868
Finchy! Brent. All right?

01:20.934 --> 01:25.767
Don't forget tonight. Oh, here we go. Straight away. Go on.

01:25.834 --> 01:29.500
What's black and slides down Nelson's Column? Don't know.

01:29.567 --> 01:32.300
Winnie Mandela? Oh, yeah, that's good.

01:32.367 --> 01:36.133
No, it's not racist. I thought the column because he's... Yeah.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.834
And she is black, and she's married. It's not even low.

01:38.901 --> 01:40.500
Yeah, 7:00. See you. Bye.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.500
What you doing in so early? Shit the bed?

01:45.567 --> 01:49.033
(LAUGHS) No. I haven't done that for weeks.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.500
No, my mum got me up at quarter to seven to give me a birthday present.

01:52.567 --> 01:54.234
-Happy birthday. -Thank you.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.701
What did she get you?

01:58.334 --> 01:59.734
Something you can wear.

02:01.834 --> 02:04.400
-The hat? -The hat, yes. Well done, yeah.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.434
Hiya. All right?

02:23.500 --> 02:26.067
-Happy birthday. -Thank you very much.

02:26.133 --> 02:27.467
Ta.

02:27.534 --> 02:29.968
-Oh, yeah. -Nice hat.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.868
Thanks.

02:31.934 --> 02:36.067
Um, good. That's all in order.

02:36.133 --> 02:38.534
"What's the difference between your wages and your penis?

02:38.601 --> 02:41.500
"I can find you lots of women who will blow your wages."

02:41.567 --> 02:43.901
-What's that? -(LAUGHS) I don't know.

02:43.968 --> 02:46.300
Why has that happened?

02:48.133 --> 02:51.000
Lock up your daughters, as they say.

02:51.067 --> 02:53.200
-Finch is on his way in for the quiz. -Oh, yeah?

02:53.267 --> 02:55.834
Chris Finch. Innit, Gareth?

02:55.901 --> 02:57.934
-Yeah. -Isn't he? Oh.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.667
Keep it that way and you'll only be able to use about 20% of it

02:59.734 --> 03:01.634
when you get me and him together!

03:01.701 --> 03:03.200
Gareth, innit?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.968
Hat.

03:07.033 --> 03:11.133
-It's Tim's birthday. -Oh, yeah?

03:11.200 --> 03:14.901
To be honest, I think you're mad to let me and Finchy on the bleeding telly!

03:14.968 --> 03:16.901
We're like Morecambe and Wise when we get together.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.334
Actually, not Morecambe and Wise, because there's no straight man,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
so there's no dead wood.

03:22.467 --> 03:27.868
So, um... I'm more sort of character based, and he's more of a gag man.

03:27.934 --> 03:29.267
I do gags as well.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.300
But I mean, good together, by now.

03:32.367 --> 03:35.334
We sort of read each other's minds when we're doing a bit of stick.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.534
We just start cracking up, and people watching go, "Why is that funny?"

03:39.601 --> 03:42.968
We tell them why and they go, "Oh, yeah. You are the best."

03:43.033 --> 03:44.801
It's their opinion.

03:44.868 --> 03:46.267
-Happy birthday, by the way. -Thank you.

03:46.334 --> 03:48.133
-Which one is it? -It's 30.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.334
The big 3-0. That's the worst one, isn't it?

03:51.400 --> 03:54.300
I know what you're thinking, "My youth's over."

03:54.367 --> 03:56.634
I remember when I was 30, like you, I was going,

03:56.701 --> 03:58.968
"Ooh, I'm in a rubbish job. My life's rubbish.

03:59.033 --> 04:01.534
"Nothing good ever happens to me. When will it change?"

04:01.601 --> 04:02.968
But, you know...

04:04.334 --> 04:06.100
-Things do change. -Mmm.

04:06.167 --> 04:10.300
And it could be worse. There's a neighbour of mine, Kelvin.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.834
He's 32 and he still lives with his parents.

04:12.901 --> 04:14.901
-I live with my parents. -Cherish them. Really.

04:14.968 --> 04:17.534
Because you will miss them when they're not around.

04:17.601 --> 04:21.000
Both, um... Both of mine are dead.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.200
-Oh. -So, er...

04:24.267 --> 04:27.834
Dad isn't dead. He's in a home.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.567
So as good as. Shot to bits. He was... Oh, God.

04:31.634 --> 04:34.834
Called out the other night, 3:00 am by the nurses.

04:34.901 --> 04:38.934
He was convinced there was a Japanese sniper on the roof of Debenhams.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.834
Does that look into his room?

04:40.901 --> 04:42.834
The back of the roof looks directly into his room, yeah.

04:42.901 --> 04:44.934
Good spot. It's a good spot.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.601
That's where I'd be if I had to take someone out that lived there.

04:49.534 --> 04:51.601
And I had to go up to the room with him, and go,

04:51.667 --> 04:53.901
"Look, Dad, there's no Japanese sniper."

04:53.968 --> 04:57.534
-So, who was it? Who was up there? -DAVID: No one was there.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.534
It was his imagination. There was no one there.

04:59.601 --> 05:01.367
GARETH: Lucky. That's lucky.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.801
'Cause if there was a sniper up there, you wouldn't see him.

05:03.868 --> 05:07.100
You'd be like, "Oh. Oh. No one there."

05:07.167 --> 05:08.968
(IMITATING GUNSHOT AND SPLATTER)

05:14.100 --> 05:17.067
Anyway, he is a vegetable now.

05:17.133 --> 05:20.334
And that's something we've all got to look forward to, so...

05:22.033 --> 05:23.400
Happy birthday.

05:24.667 --> 05:25.734
See you later.

05:30.467 --> 05:32.000
Wotcha.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.968
Shall we get him over here?

05:35.033 --> 05:38.400
Tim? Got you a pressie.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.834
-Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you. -Happy birthday, mate.

05:40.901 --> 05:43.868
Thanks very much, Lee. You're a good man.

05:44.901 --> 05:46.534
This is exciting.

05:49.601 --> 05:52.968
This is big. Big and exciting.

05:54.667 --> 05:58.100
It's a big, exciting, huge inflatable cock. God!

05:58.167 --> 05:59.901
-You can sit on that if you like. -Yay.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.334
It's not just from me, mate, it's from Dawn as well.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.901
God! You haven't got one already, have you?

06:03.968 --> 06:06.701
Um, no. You can never have too many, anyway.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.500
And you do prefer it to the money?

06:08.567 --> 06:11.901
Yeah. I'd have only spent it on a huge inflatable cock.

06:11.968 --> 06:13.801
-That is... -(DAVID LAUGHING)

06:13.868 --> 06:15.667
All right. Stop playing with it! Did you get him that?

06:15.734 --> 06:19.133
Brilliant. Oh, God, look at that.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.067
Let's have a little... Doink, doink!

06:21.133 --> 06:22.734
Ex-sperminate!

06:22.801 --> 06:23.834
(LAUGHING)

06:25.334 --> 06:26.667
Oh, no, no.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.667
"Hello, Austin Powers. I'm the naked Mini Me."

06:29.734 --> 06:33.500
I've got one. Thomas the Tank Engine rolled into town!

06:33.567 --> 06:34.734
Dickhead.

06:34.801 --> 06:39.534
Ringo Starr. Whose Line Is It Anyway?

06:39.601 --> 06:41.834
Don't grab it unless you've got one ready because it slows it down.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.634
Oh, that is brilliant.

06:45.234 --> 06:46.801
-Happy birthday. -Thank you.

06:46.868 --> 06:49.834
Remember, you're only as old as the woman you feel.

06:49.901 --> 06:51.801
-I say that sometimes. -I heard you say it the other day

06:51.868 --> 06:53.400
and I thought, "He's using one of my catchphrases."

06:53.467 --> 06:55.067
I don't mind influencing a young comedian.

06:55.133 --> 06:56.534
You're not a comedian.

06:56.601 --> 06:58.701
But, I usually credit somebody if I use their comedy.

06:58.767 --> 07:02.300
-What ones of yours do I use? -"Same shit, different day."

07:02.367 --> 07:05.701
That's mine. "Ex-squeeze me", instead of "excuse me".

07:05.767 --> 07:08.834
-Oh, "wank you very much". -Yeah. I invented that one.

07:08.901 --> 07:11.567
Say that to a waiter or something. Wank you very much!

07:13.434 --> 07:16.667
And here's one. Witnesses that I started this one.

07:16.734 --> 07:19.367
If someone's unlucky, you go, "I'm not saying he's unlucky,

07:19.434 --> 07:21.634
"but if he fell into a barrel full of tits,

07:21.701 --> 07:24.200
"he'd come up sucking his own thumb." Bit naughty.

07:24.267 --> 07:26.601
Suck tits? I thought you sucked knobs.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.834
Do ya? (LAUGHS)

07:29.400 --> 07:30.634
Got you!

07:32.901 --> 07:34.634
They're cracking up.

07:35.934 --> 07:37.467
Oh, God.

07:37.534 --> 07:39.601
Yeah. There are limits to my comedy.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.801
There are things I will never laugh at.

07:42.868 --> 07:47.100
Um...the handicapped.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.601
Because there's nothing funny about them.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.367
Or any deformity.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.000
Yeah? Um...

07:55.067 --> 07:59.834
It's like when you see someone look at a little handicapped and go,

07:59.901 --> 08:03.834
"Oh, look at him. He's not able-bodied. I am. I'm prejudiced."

08:03.901 --> 08:05.734
Yeah?

08:05.801 --> 08:10.400
Well, at least the little handicapped fella is able-minded.

08:10.467 --> 08:13.400
Unless he's not. It's difficult to tell with the wheelchair ones.

08:13.467 --> 08:16.100
So just give generously to all of them.

08:18.567 --> 08:22.767
Guys? Don't forget to say happy birthday to Tim today.

08:22.834 --> 08:25.300
And, also, we'll be going out for drinks later this evening.

08:25.367 --> 08:26.767
-What time? -Not tonight.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.534
-Why? -Quiz.

08:28.601 --> 08:30.801
Well, we can go out before. When does it start?

08:30.868 --> 08:33.634
-7:00. Always. -Okay. Drinks at 6:00, then.

08:33.701 --> 08:37.234
-Did you get him a gift? -No. But it starts at 7:00.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.434
I know. Well, okay. Drinks at 6:00.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.667
-Shall I get him a card from you? -Whatever.

08:41.868 --> 08:44.701
Finch is coming down, so got to be ready to go at 7:00.

08:44.767 --> 08:47.801
-Drinks at 6:00. -But starts at 7:00.

08:47.868 --> 08:49.567
DAWN: Drinks at 6:00.

08:55.767 --> 09:01.100
Studying? Quiz. Are you a team again?

09:01.167 --> 09:04.434
-Just three of you, is it? -Yeah.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.000
-Are you excited? First big quiz? -Looking forward to it.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.968
It's not the first, though.

09:09.033 --> 09:11.968
I, er, was on Blockbusters.

09:12.033 --> 09:13.901
-What, on the telly? -Yeah.

09:13.968 --> 09:15.634
-Yeah? -Uh-huh.

09:15.701 --> 09:18.267
Were you one of the two, or by yourself?

09:18.334 --> 09:19.834
If there's two of you, it's cheating.

09:19.901 --> 09:21.901
-Yeah. Just one. -Just one.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.434
Did you win anything or...

09:23.500 --> 09:26.133
Yeah. Two Gold Runs. Camping equipment, Walkman.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.434
-I usually get five, to be honest. -Five Gold Runs?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.801
But you know you have to answer loads of questions before...

09:31.868 --> 09:35.067
-Yeah, I do. -You get them all?

09:35.133 --> 09:38.067
Give me one of the ones you had. Fingers on the buzzers.

09:38.133 --> 09:40.133
Um... Okay.

09:40.200 --> 09:45.734
Right. Which Y was... Which Y had a hit single with The Only Way Is Up

09:45.801 --> 09:47.968
-and sang with Plastic Population? -Yazoo!

09:48.033 --> 09:49.701
-Yazz. -Yep.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.367
-You said Yazoo, which... -I know.

09:51.434 --> 09:53.934
What's your cut-off point, though? Yazz.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.334
But you said Yazoo first.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.701
You would've got it wrong on Blockbusters.

09:56.767 --> 09:57.934
I wouldn't have said it on Blockbusters.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.167
You'd have been all right, then.

10:00.234 --> 10:02.734
I'll give you one. A proper one. Um...

10:11.000 --> 10:12.400
-Do you want a hand? -No, no.

10:14.601 --> 10:17.901
-Are you getting it? -Yeah. A tiny bit loud.

10:17.968 --> 10:20.434
-Sorry. -Can I have this when you've finished?

10:20.500 --> 10:22.000
-Yeah, you can have it. -When will you be finished?

10:22.067 --> 10:25.601
I don't know. Maybe we could share it.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.367
-Okay. I'll just have it on weekends! -Okay.

10:33.567 --> 10:37.167
-Is this going to take... -No, it was going to be what D

10:37.234 --> 10:39.634
and the answer was going to be Dostoyevsky.

10:39.701 --> 10:42.133
-I couldn't think of the question. -All right. Okay. Well...

10:42.200 --> 10:46.267
What D was a Russian dissident who wrote the novel Crime and Punishment?

10:46.334 --> 10:49.167
-Would you have got that? -I'd have had a guess.

10:49.234 --> 10:50.968
You don't get prizes for guessing.

10:51.968 --> 10:54.234
Unlucky. See you later.

10:57.968 --> 10:59.033
(EXHALES)

11:00.534 --> 11:02.300
You can't come in here. Quiz officials only.

11:02.367 --> 11:03.534
TIM: What are you doing?

11:03.601 --> 11:05.133
I'm the quizmaster and I'm doing the questions.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.968
Get out now, or I'll report you. Simple as that.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.567
-Are these the questions? -Yeah, do not look at those! Right.

11:09.634 --> 11:11.701
Disqualification. You're both disqualified.

11:11.767 --> 11:14.634
Um, Gareth, we're having an argument. We need your help.

11:14.701 --> 11:17.200
-Not interested. -No, listen. 'Cause you can help.

11:17.267 --> 11:19.400
No, I don't want to help. I haven't got time to help, all right?

11:19.467 --> 11:22.434
-Right. It's about the army. -Go on, then, quick.

11:22.500 --> 11:27.033
I was wondering if a military man like you,

11:27.100 --> 11:28.701
a soldier,

11:28.767 --> 11:33.467
could you give a man a lethal blow?

11:33.534 --> 11:37.167
If I was forced to, I could. If it was absolutely necessary.

11:37.234 --> 11:38.834
If he was attacking me.

11:38.901 --> 11:42.167
If he was coming really hard.

11:42.234 --> 11:44.868
Yeah. If my life was in danger, yeah.

11:44.934 --> 11:48.300
And do you always imagine doing it face to face with a bloke,

11:48.367 --> 11:50.534
or could you take a man from behind?

11:50.601 --> 11:52.300
-Either way is easy. -Either way.

11:52.367 --> 11:54.901
And so you could do a man from behind?

11:54.968 --> 11:57.334
-Yeah. -Yeah. Lovely.

12:07.367 --> 12:12.234
It's got an error, an offline error 324.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.934
So I'm going to have to take the paper out.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.267
That comes out.

12:16.334 --> 12:17.701
-Hiya. -Hiya.

12:17.767 --> 12:20.267
Do you know about these? I'm trying to fix this.

12:20.334 --> 12:24.133
It's got an offline 243 error that I just...

12:24.200 --> 12:26.033
-No. -I don't really know what that is so...

12:26.100 --> 12:29.067
You know, we were talking earlier about Dostoyevsky, weren't we?

12:29.133 --> 12:32.367
-Oh, yeah? -Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky.

12:32.434 --> 12:36.367
-Born 1821. Died 1881. -That's right.

12:36.434 --> 12:37.934
Just interesting that stuff about him

12:38.000 --> 12:39.767
being exiled in Siberia for four years, wasn't it?

12:39.834 --> 12:43.234
Well, I don't know much about that. I didn't cover it, really.

12:43.300 --> 12:47.467
All it is is he was a member of a secret political party

12:47.534 --> 12:50.601
and they put him in a Siberian labour camp for four years,

12:50.667 --> 12:52.334
so, you know.

12:53.567 --> 12:56.500
Hang on. I read about it in, er...

12:56.567 --> 12:59.133
He wrote House of the Dead.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.500
I think he put all his memoirs in that.

13:02.567 --> 13:03.968
Didn't he?

13:04.500 --> 13:05.567
Yep.

13:07.534 --> 13:08.801
Oh.

13:12.901 --> 13:16.968
So, you've dug your foxhole and you've pitched your tent.

13:17.033 --> 13:20.133
-GARETH: Right. -They've discovered your camp,

13:20.200 --> 13:23.367
and you're lying there, and they've caught you with your trousers down,

13:23.434 --> 13:26.701
and they've all entered your hole without you knowing.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.701
No, because I'd be ready for them.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.000
You'd just be lying there waiting for it?

13:31.067 --> 13:34.334
Yeah. Well, no. What's more likely is that I wouldn't be there

13:34.400 --> 13:36.267
if I knew they knew where I was.

13:36.334 --> 13:39.467
I'd be hiding, watching the hole, using it as a trap.

13:39.534 --> 13:43.067
-So, you'd be using your hole as bait? -Yeah.

13:43.133 --> 13:47.500
You're how old? 30? And you're getting off on pretending Gareth's gay.

13:48.767 --> 13:50.834
-What? -What?

13:52.300 --> 13:54.434
I think she's been on the waccy baccy!

13:55.934 --> 13:56.901
Yeah.

13:59.901 --> 14:02.100
Oh. Wassup.

14:05.067 --> 14:08.567
It's very complicated. You open that, put that in there,

14:08.634 --> 14:11.100
put that down there, and you...

14:11.167 --> 14:13.067
-Hiya. -...push the green button.

14:13.133 --> 14:17.000
Were we talking earlier about Dostoyevsky's House of the Dead?

14:17.067 --> 14:20.767
-Yeah. I think we mentioned it. -Which he wrote in 1862.

14:20.834 --> 14:24.200
I was just going to say that it wasn't his first major work.

14:24.267 --> 14:25.801
Wasn't it?

14:25.868 --> 14:28.434
No. His first major work was Notes from the Underground,

14:28.500 --> 14:30.934
which he wrote when he got back to St Petersburg in 1859.

14:31.133 --> 14:33.100
-Really? -Yep. Definitely.

14:33.167 --> 14:36.701
Well, of course, my favourite is The Raw Youth.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.901
It's basically where Dostoyevsky goes on to explain

14:38.968 --> 14:43.701
how science can't really find answers for the deeper human need.

14:43.767 --> 14:44.968
Yeah. He does.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.267
Yeah.

14:50.267 --> 14:52.000
Whatever happens, it ain't going to be a flashy wedding.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.834
-Heaven forbid. -No.

14:53.901 --> 14:56.234
Yeah, it'll just be a registry office. Save money.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.367
Then what we'll probably do is move in with me mum for a few months.

14:59.434 --> 15:01.267
-Save on rent? -Yeah.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.200
Let Dawn get a few kiddies under her belt.

15:03.267 --> 15:06.434
Which'll be nice because then my mum can look after them.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.300
You'll probably go out and get a part-time cleaning job or something.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.601
Got to dream the dream.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.667
(TIM LAUGHING)

15:12.734 --> 15:14.267
What's that?

15:14.334 --> 15:16.701
I was just laughing at what Dawn said.

15:16.767 --> 15:19.334
-'Cause you're such a big high flyer. -No.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.033
I was laughing at her joke, that's all.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.601
When you get a life, mate, you can take the mickey out of ours.

15:23.667 --> 15:26.567
-I'm not having a go, I'm just... -No, listen, mate.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.100
I don't mean to have a go at you. You're fine. No worries.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.467
-We've all had a coffee. -No worries.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.634
Is it questions? Is it an intro? What I'm saying is...

15:38.701 --> 15:41.234
Oi! Finchy!

15:41.300 --> 15:43.200
Tell me, man. When's it due?

15:43.267 --> 15:45.100
Here we go. Fasten your seatbelts.

15:45.167 --> 15:46.901
There's not a seatbelt big enough for you, you fat bastard.

15:46.968 --> 15:49.067
All bought and paid for, innit?

15:49.133 --> 15:52.100
I'm not saying he's fat, but when he jumps in the air, he gets stuck.

15:52.167 --> 15:55.067
"I'm David Brent. I'm David Brent."

15:55.133 --> 15:57.133
Jim Carrey on acid!

15:57.200 --> 16:00.100
You know what they say, there's none so queer as folk,

16:00.167 --> 16:02.601
-or David Brent. -Oh, speak to yourself...

16:02.667 --> 16:04.601
Spit it out, as your boyfriend said last night!

16:04.667 --> 16:06.133
I was just going to say that back to you.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.901
Yeah. But, I don't have a boyfriend, you do.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.033
-Can't get a bloody word in edgeways! -Can't get a what in edgeways?

16:10.100 --> 16:11.934
-Ooh, matron! -Come on, then, fat lad.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.067
Oh, that, we're always...

16:14.133 --> 16:17.100
Oh, God. Finchy.

16:25.334 --> 16:27.901
Come and check out the opposition.

16:27.968 --> 16:30.734
-Yeah, uh, Ricky, this is Chris. -Hello, mate.

16:30.801 --> 16:33.534
I'm Chris Finch. I heard about Blockbusters.

16:33.601 --> 16:37.367
You'll need more than that tonight. I heard about your Dostoyevsky.

16:37.434 --> 16:40.567
I read a book a week, so a question like that's not going to catch me out.

16:40.634 --> 16:42.300
While you're down there, love...

16:42.367 --> 16:43.934
Close to the bone but harmless, innit?

16:44.133 --> 16:47.100
Christ. Give me half hour with her, I'll be up to my nuts in guts.

16:47.167 --> 16:50.000
Sorry. Exactly which books do you read every week?

16:50.067 --> 16:52.667
Science. Science and nature.

16:52.734 --> 16:55.467
Everything on the Trivia board. All those different subjects.

16:55.534 --> 16:57.300
In books.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.467
These lot sound like they haven't read a book between them!

16:59.534 --> 17:02.834
-College boys. -Bloody students. Waste of space.

17:02.901 --> 17:06.834
"Oh, I don't do anything all day, but I need more money to do it."

17:06.901 --> 17:08.400
(LAUGHS) Political.

17:08.467 --> 17:11.167
Yeah. I had a job when I was studying, so...

17:11.234 --> 17:13.734
Yeah, right! And what was your job?

17:13.801 --> 17:17.300
Professor in charge of watching Countdown every day?

17:17.367 --> 17:19.434
He's clever and funny. I bloody hate him.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.400
That's why we get on, really, innit?

17:22.467 --> 17:23.567
Similar.

17:24.534 --> 17:26.467
(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

17:28.834 --> 17:31.100
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

17:31.167 --> 17:36.200
Welcome to the seventh annual Wernham Hogg quiz night.

17:36.267 --> 17:39.767
Current champions are this team here, The Dead Parrots.

17:39.834 --> 17:41.634
-Fit enough to fly. -He sleeps.

17:41.701 --> 17:43.367
If you hadn't nailed him to the perch, he would be

17:43.434 --> 17:45.167
-pushing up the daisies! -Pushing up the daisies!

17:45.234 --> 17:47.834
Monty Python.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.767
-Question one. All right... -Hang on.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.200
David, we haven't...

17:52.267 --> 17:55.300
Oh, yeah. Tim's birthday today.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.701
He's 30 years young, as I always say.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.701
(APPLAUSE)

18:01.734 --> 18:04.834
So what better way to celebrate than a battle of wits?

18:04.901 --> 18:06.167
Speech!

18:07.634 --> 18:09.767
GARETH: Okay. Question one.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.701
In the mid-1960s,

18:11.767 --> 18:15.133
the US Army replaced all existing infantry guns

18:15.200 --> 18:20.200
with the M-16 rifle and which fixed-rate, repeat-fire machine gun?

18:20.267 --> 18:23.634
-You what? -Write the answer if you know it.

18:23.701 --> 18:25.601
Next.

18:25.667 --> 18:29.133
DAVID: We've been quiz champions for six years now.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.801
We nearly lost it two years ago, unjustly.

18:31.868 --> 18:35.133
Because Gareth was quizmaster then and the question was,

18:35.200 --> 18:38.167
what type of alien is Mr Spock?

18:38.234 --> 18:42.100
Everyone put Vulcan, which is incorrect.

18:42.167 --> 18:47.067
Mr Spock is half-Vulcan, half-human, okay?

18:47.133 --> 18:49.167
And Gareth went, "Oh, look, everyone gets one point,"

18:49.234 --> 18:51.100
but I said, "No, everyone does not get one point.

18:51.167 --> 18:54.133
"Carpet Munchers don't get a point, Dr Wankenstein doesn't.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.701
"Steven Hawkings' Football Boots don't get a point. I do."

18:56.767 --> 18:59.701
I had to go home to get a book to prove it.

18:59.767 --> 19:03.934
They went, "Oh, yeah, you're right. Well done. You've won. Sorry."

19:04.000 --> 19:06.334
No apologies necessary. Let's get on with the quiz but...

19:07.634 --> 19:08.801
Remember. Learn.

19:10.033 --> 19:11.567
Okay, question two.

19:11.634 --> 19:14.200
In the song 19 by Paul Hardcastle,

19:14.267 --> 19:18.767
he told us that the average age of a soldier in the Vietnam War was 19.

19:18.834 --> 19:21.734
Hardcastle also told us the average age of a soldier

19:21.801 --> 19:22.968
in the Second World War.

19:23.033 --> 19:24.300
What was it?

19:24.367 --> 19:26.300
Gareth, are all these going to be about war?

19:26.367 --> 19:28.000
No. I got loads of...

19:28.067 --> 19:31.667
I got one on tennis, one on the Suez Canal. Loads.

19:33.133 --> 19:35.000
Okay. Question three.

19:35.067 --> 19:39.834
Which canal links the Mediterranean with the Red Sea?

19:39.901 --> 19:43.634
Oh, I don't want to talk about Mr Spock. That was all sorted out then.

19:43.701 --> 19:46.901
Questions were asked. Certain parties weren't happy.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.968
The questions were solved. End of discussion.

19:50.033 --> 19:52.467
All right? Don't rake up old graves.

19:52.534 --> 19:53.968
I don't want to go through all that again

19:54.033 --> 19:58.434
about whether he's a Vulcan or a human or vice versa.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.667
All I will say is what I said at the time. Okay?

20:01.734 --> 20:04.033
Look at his ears.

20:04.100 --> 20:08.067
How could you confuse Howard Jones with Nik Kershaw? Shame on you.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.067
Nik Kershaw's the little bloke...

20:10.133 --> 20:12.100
Howard Jones was the one with the...

20:12.167 --> 20:14.934
That whole round's about old entertainment.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.767
It's about old entertainment.

20:16.834 --> 20:20.167
It's all about late '60s, early '70s.

20:20.234 --> 20:23.100
-Which insect produces gossamer? -Shh! Come on, man.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.667
-Which insect produces gossamer? -DAVID: What is it?

20:25.734 --> 20:27.634
-I want you to answer, Finchy! -What is it?

20:27.701 --> 20:28.901
It's a spider.

20:29.100 --> 20:31.400
A spider is an arachnid, not an insect.

20:31.467 --> 20:34.133
-Ha, yes! -Six legs or eight legs?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.367
-Thank you. Am I right? -Two out.

20:36.434 --> 20:37.701
DAVID: Shame on you.

20:39.367 --> 20:42.901
Ha! Eight legs, six legs. Eight legs, six legs.

20:42.968 --> 20:47.567
You just need to spend a few terms at the university of life.

20:47.634 --> 20:49.868
A spider is not an insect officially. Thank you.

20:49.934 --> 20:53.467
RICKY: We'll see, we'll see. We'll see when this is over.

20:53.534 --> 20:56.767
People go, "Why is it important, a question about Mr Spock?"

20:56.834 --> 21:01.200
I go, "It's like saying, I've got a new pedigree dog breed.

21:01.267 --> 21:03.100
"It's half Alsatian, half Labrador."

21:03.167 --> 21:06.934
I go along to Crufts, I go, "Can I enter this dog in the Labrador section?"

21:07.000 --> 21:10.367
"No." "Why?" "Because it's not a Labrador." "Correct."

21:10.434 --> 21:13.200
"Can I enter it in the Alsatian section?" "No. For the same reasons.

21:13.267 --> 21:15.100
"Now, get that dog out of my sight."

21:15.167 --> 21:17.200
"Thanks, I will. You've proved my point."

21:19.100 --> 21:22.367
And that's Crufts. All right?

21:22.434 --> 21:25.634
Who had a hit single with Don't Speak?

21:27.634 --> 21:30.767
No Doubt. Yeah. I thought it might be No Doubt.

21:30.834 --> 21:33.100
Why did you say Four Non Blondes, then?

21:33.167 --> 21:36.234
I got Hootie the Blowfish, so let's move on.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.834
East... East Side.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.901
Oi.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.567
-I didn't know. -You do know.

21:43.634 --> 21:44.901
Didn't know.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.334
-Missed. -Did I?

21:51.400 --> 21:54.133
I said No Doubt. That was the first thing that came in.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.367
And then you're putting this thing in my mind.

21:56.434 --> 21:59.467
Poison with your bloody Four Non Blondes.

21:59.534 --> 22:01.334
-Eh? -Both good groups.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.701
Just don't guess. Think. Logical. Think.

22:04.767 --> 22:07.000
There's no logic to music, it's art.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.834
-God! -Is this the first time you've lost?

22:10.901 --> 22:13.534
We're not losing. The right questions aren't coming up.

22:13.601 --> 22:15.868
It's the whole point of a quiz, isn't it? Isn't it supposed to be random?

22:15.934 --> 22:17.634
Yeah, well, randomly awful.

22:17.701 --> 22:20.300
-Next time, I'll choose the questions. -Good quizmaster.

22:20.367 --> 22:21.868
-Choose a topic. -All right. Sport.

22:21.934 --> 22:24.801
-What's the capital of Iceland? -Reykjavik.

22:24.868 --> 22:27.734
-Is that still a sport? -All right. You. Capital of Borneo?

22:27.801 --> 22:29.968
-Don't care. -See? It doesn't have one.

22:30.033 --> 22:32.534
-You didn't get any of those, did you? -(MOBILE RINGS)

22:32.601 --> 22:34.868
-And they were random, yeah. -It wasn't really random.

22:34.934 --> 22:37.367
DAVID: Hello, Doctor.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.434
He's asking after me?

22:41.500 --> 22:45.500
No. There's no way I can get away now. I am snowed under at work.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.801
Can't you give him something to help him sleep?

22:47.868 --> 22:49.968
Okay. Yeah.

22:50.033 --> 22:52.234
Okay. Thanks. Oh...

22:52.300 --> 22:56.434
You don't know who sang In the Summertime do you?

22:56.500 --> 23:00.100
Mungo Jerry. Okay. Yep, yep. Cheers.

23:07.968 --> 23:11.400
All right, yeah. Ha ha! Very funny.

23:11.467 --> 23:13.767
Do you want to hear the results or not?

23:13.834 --> 23:18.067
Okay. In position number four, Universally Challenged.

23:23.934 --> 23:26.100
Third place goes to...

23:27.133 --> 23:29.100
Malcolm and Dennis!

23:30.801 --> 23:33.968
Er, which means that... Well...

23:36.734 --> 23:39.934
It's a dead heat between the Dead Parrots and The Tits.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.267
So tie-breaker situation.

23:42.334 --> 23:47.901
Could you send one member of each of your teams up for a tie-breaker?

23:48.100 --> 23:51.701
All right. Come and stand here. Tie-breaker question. Are you ready?

23:51.767 --> 23:54.434
First person to shout out the correct answer wins.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.834
All right? So, if you're ready.

23:56.901 --> 24:00.267
Which Shakespeare play features a character called Caliban?

24:00.334 --> 24:02.234
-Macbeth. -GARETH: No. Ricky?

24:02.300 --> 24:05.334
-Midsummer Night's Dream. Hamlet. -No. You've had your go.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.634
No. You said the first person to shout out the answer wins.

24:07.701 --> 24:09.067
You didn't say you only had one chance.

24:09.133 --> 24:11.934
-The Tempest. -The Tempest. He's got it!

24:12.000 --> 24:14.500
There it is. Ladies and gentlemen, the winners.

24:14.567 --> 24:15.868
That's Blockbusters!

24:16.067 --> 24:17.400
(ALL CHEERING)

24:17.467 --> 24:19.367
You didn't say you only had one go.

24:19.434 --> 24:22.334
You said the first person to shout out the answer wins, yeah?

24:22.400 --> 24:25.100
The first person. That's my point.

24:47.801 --> 24:50.467
Here he is. Chris Finch. Is it Hamlet or is it Macbeth?

24:50.534 --> 24:54.100
Maybe I'll write the questions next time and you can have this fat bastard.

24:54.167 --> 24:55.901
-Banter. -No, it's not banter.

24:55.968 --> 24:58.500
-It's not banter, not now. -Okay. When we had the question,

24:58.567 --> 25:01.734
"Name the Cuban leader who's been in power since the revolution in 1959."

25:01.801 --> 25:04.300
-Fidel Castro. -You know it now. But what did you say?

25:04.367 --> 25:08.100
-It's in that situation... -Tell them. What did you say then?

25:08.167 --> 25:10.200
What did you say then? Go on.

25:13.901 --> 25:15.234
Who's the Cuban leader?

25:16.500 --> 25:18.367
-Fray Bentos. -(MAN LAUGHS)

25:18.434 --> 25:21.601
No wonder this place is going down the pan. You're a waste of space.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.133
Hey, don't get at him just 'cause they beat you.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.901
-They beat me? -Yes.

25:25.968 --> 25:27.500
I could give you a list of 50 things I could beat them at.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.968
-Like what? -Like throwing.

25:30.033 --> 25:32.234
Throwing. No. That's good.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.567
The landlord of the Lamb Pub in Chichester

25:34.634 --> 25:38.367
challenges me to throw one of these copper kettles over his pub.

25:38.434 --> 25:42.734
So I go outside, take off my tie, tie it to the handle. (WHISTLES)

25:42.801 --> 25:44.200
Did it go over?

25:44.267 --> 25:46.067
(WHISTLES AND IMITATES CRASHING)

25:46.133 --> 25:49.734
Obviously. That's actually an official Territorial Army method

25:49.801 --> 25:51.767
if you're in the jungle.

25:51.834 --> 25:53.534
Except you wouldn't use a tie obviously, you'd use vines from the trees.

25:53.601 --> 25:56.234
-DAWN: Would you use a kettle? -No, it'd be the equivalent. Coconut.

25:56.300 --> 25:59.334
I will throw anything that you choose over this building.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.133
-If I do it, we win the quiz. -New challenge.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.801
-Double or quits. -It's a challenge.

26:03.868 --> 26:05.601
So you choose anything, if he can throw it over,

26:05.667 --> 26:07.767
we've won the champagne, and that it. That's the real quiz.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.701
That's the real quiz. Choose one thing.

26:09.767 --> 26:12.367
You really are a couple of sad little men, aren't you?

26:12.434 --> 26:14.000
Oh, they're sad little men?

26:14.067 --> 26:16.200
He's thrown a kettle over a pub, what have you done?

26:16.267 --> 26:17.734
Do you want a challenge or not?

26:17.801 --> 26:19.734
If I do it, we win the quiz, we win the prize.

26:19.801 --> 26:22.367
-That's the real quiz. -Now, you choose something.

26:22.434 --> 26:24.234
-Choose something. -(ALL CLAMOURING)

26:25.534 --> 26:27.267
-A chair? -No, not a chair.

26:27.334 --> 26:28.667
-Throw Gareth over. -No, seriously...

26:28.734 --> 26:31.100
How about the birthday boy? Throw him over.

26:31.167 --> 26:33.367
-Throw his shoes over. -His shoes.

26:33.434 --> 26:35.300
-TIM: No, no! -(ALL CLAMOUR NOISILY)

26:35.367 --> 26:37.400
It's just a challenge.

26:38.701 --> 26:40.834
Tickle him! Tickle him! Tickle him!

26:40.901 --> 26:43.300
Can I have it back? Oi!

26:46.467 --> 26:48.634
-Using the tie method? -Oh, no. The shoelaces.

26:48.701 --> 26:51.801
-He's using the laces. -Bastard! I knew he would!

26:51.868 --> 26:54.534
-DAVID: Typical. That'll work! -So, Finch...

26:54.601 --> 26:58.067
-Thank you very much... -You'll get it back.

26:58.133 --> 26:59.234
(ALL CLAMOURING)

27:01.367 --> 27:03.400
RICKY: How are we going to know if it goes over?

27:03.467 --> 27:04.801
-What? -How're we gonna know if it goes over?

27:04.868 --> 27:06.901
Go and check if it goes over. Sussed. Go on.

27:06.968 --> 27:10.400
Right. Here we go.

27:10.467 --> 27:13.801
Two and three and four...

27:15.167 --> 27:17.667
-Hooray! -Oh, yes!

27:17.734 --> 27:19.601
Looking good.

27:19.667 --> 27:21.634
-Come on now. -RICKY: Did it go over?

27:21.701 --> 27:24.500
DAVID: Did it go over? SHEILA: Yeah. It came right past me.

27:24.567 --> 27:26.300
(ALL CHEERING)

27:26.367 --> 27:29.434
-The Wonder Horse! -Screw Blockbusters!

27:29.500 --> 27:32.067
Screw Bob Holness and screw your Gold Run.

27:32.133 --> 27:34.267
-You're right. I'm a loser. I'm a loser. -You're shit, you're shit!

27:34.334 --> 27:35.868
-That's the boss. -Yes, I am the boss.

27:35.934 --> 27:38.167
Like Springsteen. Born to run. The Slough branch.

27:38.234 --> 27:41.200
Your university education didn't help you there, did it?

27:41.267 --> 27:43.234
Now, let that be a lesson to you.

27:43.300 --> 27:46.234
Respect your elders and do not fuck with the big boys.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.067
-Life! Life! -Chuck his hat over.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.234
No, don't! It's a radio as well.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.901
(DAVID IMITATING GUITAR SOLO)

DAVID: What an office. What an office!

28:04.534 --> 28:07.467
-Do you want any...help? -Dawn, let's go. See you, Tim.

28:09.067 --> 28:10.601
See you later.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.834
# So what becomes of you, my love

28:25.300 --> 28:30.100
# When they have finally stripped you of

# The handbags and the gladrags

28:32.334 --> 28:36.801
# That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy #
