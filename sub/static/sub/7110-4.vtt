[gulls squawking]

[birds twittering]

00:23.857 --> 00:26.127
[sighs]

00:27.528 --> 00:32.300
Good morning.
Did you have any dreams?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.634
Mm-mmm.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.240
[whirring]

00:39.307 --> 00:41.075
I never remember my dreams.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.112
You have plans today?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.214
Uh-uh.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.783
Don't think I don't notice.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.486
You coming and going

00:52.553 --> 00:54.922
and Trotskying
all over the place.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.290
Staying out all night.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.092
I stayed at my friend's.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.428
I can come and go
as I please.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.231
I'm not asking to be
Velcroed to your hip.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.300
I just think it would be nice
to go out together in public

01:06.367 --> 01:08.136
every once in a while.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.538
[whirring]

01:10.604 --> 01:12.273
Do I make you happy?

01:14.041 --> 01:15.509
You do.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.548
** [theme]

02:02.556 --> 02:06.727
I told you everybody would
have wacky hair except us.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.463
Uh, no. Actually, you were
worried that no one would.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.399
So you made me wash it out
and then put it back

02:11.465 --> 02:12.866
and then wash it out again.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.203
Because you only had
one dumb barrette

02:15.236 --> 02:16.904
and silver spray
that hurt my eyes.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.340
All right, well, I have
the moose ears and the crown,

02:19.407 --> 02:20.841
if you wanna wear
the moose ears and the crown.

02:20.908 --> 02:24.478
It's just a stupid hat.
It's not stupid hat day.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.746
- Okay.
- You're the worst--

02:25.813 --> 02:28.282
- Thank you. Bye. Thank you.
- Stuart, nice.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.087
- Come, like, around six?
- Poppy?

02:34.222 --> 02:35.889
- Yeah?
- Hi. Good morning.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.459
Um, regarding Wacky Hair Day.
The thing is,

02:38.526 --> 02:40.861
kids are naturally anxious
about their appearance

02:40.928 --> 02:43.497
just really on any given day,

02:43.564 --> 02:46.267
so to disrupt the routine,
you know,

02:46.334 --> 02:49.637
a routine that some of us
are barely hanging on to

02:49.703 --> 02:52.440
just to get them dressed
and out the door
and get the snack made

02:52.506 --> 02:54.242
and get the lunch made
and get the sunscreen on

02:54.275 --> 02:55.609
and get them in the car
and get them here on time,

02:55.676 --> 02:59.513
and then you, kind of,
add this, um, lunatic

02:59.580 --> 03:02.716
wacky hair wrench
into the works--

03:02.783 --> 03:06.254
- Sarah, are you okay?
- Uh, no.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.555
No. I--

03:07.621 --> 03:09.323
I'm a single parent now.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.625
- And I don't--
- Okay. Come on.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.627
I don't know how anybody
does anything.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.397
I know how hard it is, okay?

03:16.464 --> 03:20.100
Spirit Week is a wonderful
but intense time

03:20.167 --> 03:21.669
for all of us.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.272
Pajama Day,
Favorite Superhero Day,

03:24.338 --> 03:28.942
- the "Gayla," it's--
- Oh, fuck. The Gala.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.445
- "Gayla."
- The Gala.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.958
What's up, dude? Oh!

03:45.025 --> 03:47.027
- Hey.
- Sorry. Uh--

03:47.094 --> 03:49.129
- No, it's okay.
- Do your thing.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.731
- I'll be right out.
- Okay. Yeah.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.782
I just busted Colton,
and he was, like, praying,

04:08.849 --> 04:11.619
like, all on his knees
with his hands clasped.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.755
It was like one of those
Precious Moments figurines
in there.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.457
That's a way to do it.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.692
It was a little embarrassing.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.429
I pray.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.064
Right. Of course.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.367
Um, you are a rabbi.

04:26.434 --> 04:30.037
And you, um--
You do that?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.539
I guess--

04:31.605 --> 04:34.408
At my old house, I had,
like, a cushion,

04:34.475 --> 04:37.778
and I just kind of...

04:37.845 --> 04:39.480
had a special place,

04:39.547 --> 04:42.750
and I made it a point
every morning

04:42.816 --> 04:45.619
- and evening, and--
- Do you have an area here?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.020
No.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.357
- No, I've been slacking off.
- Slacking?

04:49.390 --> 04:50.691
We gotta get you,
like, a setup

04:50.758 --> 04:52.626
with a cushion
and the whole thing, right?

04:52.693 --> 04:55.363
I'm-- Yeah, 'cause
I guess I'm not

04:55.363 --> 04:57.698
an on-your-knees
kind of a gal.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.700
- Hey, what's up?
- We were just talking

04:59.767 --> 05:02.903
about how awesome it is that
you have a spiritual practice,

05:02.970 --> 05:05.272
- and how I have one as well.
- Yeah, that's great.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.840
Yeah, I mean,
the both of you guys.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.376
I'm, like, the heathen
up in this house.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.479
- No, you're not.
- Please don't say that.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.213
You're a spiritual person.
You just don't have

05:13.280 --> 05:17.385
- a practice--
- A practice. Yeah.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.587
...that's personal.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.789
What kind of stuff
do you pray about?

05:21.855 --> 05:26.694
Oh, I pray for you guys,
for the pregnancy, obviously,

05:26.760 --> 05:29.029
um, my family back
in Overland Park,

05:29.096 --> 05:30.864
and Rita a lot.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.200
Recently, ever since
I moved in with you guys,

05:33.266 --> 05:36.670
I don't know,
something hasn't been
sitting right with her.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.639
Um...

05:42.543 --> 05:45.145
- All right, let's do this.
- Yeah, okay.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.814
- Let's do this!
- All right.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.457
The people in my group
at the LGBT center,

05:56.524 --> 05:58.191
they say that you have
to have a letter

05:58.258 --> 05:59.292
if you're
gonna physically--

05:59.427 --> 06:00.994
We don't
need that anymore.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.596
Oh, I didn't
know that.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.197
Well,
that's progress.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.233
I'd like to begin you
on a low dose

06:06.299 --> 06:07.768
of a testosterone blocker.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.337
- Not the Lupron?
- Yes, well, yes.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.805
Because Medicare
might not cover Lupron.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.507
I have Blue Cross.
I have a PPO.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.943
I gave them--
that person at the desk.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.010
Okay, then.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.646
Are you sexually active?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.182
Yes, somewhat.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.751
I mean, I would like--

06:23.817 --> 06:25.853
- I want to do more.
- Okay.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.556
What kind of sex
are you having?
Do you top or bottom?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.461
I really--
Actually, Doctor,

06:33.527 --> 06:35.963
I don't understand...
the sexual position--

06:36.029 --> 06:38.331
What does that have
to do with my health?

06:38.466 --> 06:42.069
Hormone treatment
may prevent you from
sustaining an erection.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.939
- I didn't know that.
- Do you plan on
getting breasts?

06:46.006 --> 06:47.775
Two, please.

06:47.841 --> 06:51.845
Do you plan on undergoing
gender reassignment surgery?

06:57.217 --> 06:59.987
I'm gonna have to get back
to you on that one.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.258
Mrs. Pfefferman,
do yourself a favor

07:05.325 --> 07:06.894
and get to know your body.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.013
Cute nose.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.292
Say we live together
when we're old

07:39.359 --> 07:41.261
at a place like this--

07:41.328 --> 07:43.396
It's not as depressing
as it seems--

07:43.531 --> 07:45.065
Bunks or side-by-side?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.534
- Bunks.
- What?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.602
- I want the bottom.
- Okay.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.252
Hi. Hi, Rose.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.220
Hi, it's Ali.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.189
Your granddaughter Ali.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.196
We haven't seen each other
in a really long time.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.020
Rose, do you remember me?

08:40.087 --> 08:42.289
Gershon.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.660
You're here.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.843
[both laughing]

09:12.219 --> 09:15.255
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

09:15.322 --> 09:16.990
Told you about that!

09:27.868 --> 09:31.639
So, look, I was thinking
about what you said

09:31.705 --> 09:34.942
this morning
about Rita and stuff.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.114
I was thinking we should
have her over for dinner.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.652
We can, like, make her a part
of our bigger family, right?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.854
Yeah.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.024
- That'd be good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.934
So they say the first step
is asking for help,

10:01.001 --> 10:03.671
so help.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.939
I'm just like--
I've never really seen a rab--

10:06.006 --> 10:07.975
I'm not really usually
into the whole rabbi thing.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.078
'Cause it's, like,
mostly guys with beards
that creep me out,

10:11.144 --> 10:12.479
but, I don't know,
you're cool.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.682
Cool rabbi.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.117
There's so much stuff
going on at school.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.087
And every time I go there,
I wanna go hide in a corner.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.089
- Yeah.
- It's like I am family-less

10:22.155 --> 10:24.091
so they don't know
what to do with me.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.159
Don't care
about those moms.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.396
Everyone feels like
they're on the outside.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.531
Not just you.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.433
You're happy.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.368
How did you get to be
so happy?

10:35.435 --> 10:39.072
- I'm not happy all the time.
- You seem pretty happy.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.174
Like, every time I see you,
you're pretty--

10:41.241 --> 10:44.377
I'm as confused
and complicated
as any other person.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.378
- Really?
- Yes.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.347
You're like so--

10:47.414 --> 10:49.349
Just go, just easy.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.788
I mean, I can just
talk to you as...

10:54.855 --> 10:57.024
as, like, a friend
right now and not--

10:57.090 --> 11:00.160
Yeah! Oh, my God!
Please.

11:01.795 --> 11:05.165
- Rita...
- [chuckles]

11:05.232 --> 11:07.367
- No, I mean, it's like--
- No, I'm sorry.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.804
- I got a Rita in my life.
- Yeah, of course.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.273
And it's becoming
very obvious that,

11:13.340 --> 11:16.243
if...

11:16.309 --> 11:18.411
we want Colton,

11:18.478 --> 11:19.747
which he does,

11:19.747 --> 11:22.750
which we do,

11:22.816 --> 11:26.119
then we're also
going to get Rita.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.332
[crowd chatters]

11:47.440 --> 11:48.776
What do you mean?

11:48.776 --> 11:50.677
You said he was already
giving us that date.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.280
Jesus. Yeah. Okay.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.682
Speak to you Monday.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.651
Fucking judges.
So fucking judgmental.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.454
- Sorry.
- No.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.890
Let me know
if you need anything else.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.125
Orrin, can you
just leave it open?

12:05.192 --> 12:06.794
I'm gonna have another sunser

12:06.860 --> 12:09.562
and, um,
and one for, um...

12:09.629 --> 12:11.398
- the lawyer is it?
- Oh!

12:11.464 --> 12:14.367
- 'Cause I think, um--
- Thank you.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.037
- ...you need something.
You need a little relief.
- I do.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.507
- I do. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.579
What kind of
lawyer are you?

12:26.646 --> 12:27.981
Uh, probate.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.051
- Oh.
- You? You an attorney?

12:31.118 --> 12:35.956
No, but I follow
the law to a "T".

12:36.023 --> 12:39.426
- [laughs]
- You have a nice laugh.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.495
- Oh.
- Here you go.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.064
- Here. Cheers.
- Cheers.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.033
- To a better day.
- Thank you.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.400
- I'm Maura.
- Hi. Cynthia.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.836
Hi.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.847
Could we have a menu
for the tapas?

12:59.913 --> 13:01.614
Let's have some tapas.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.316
- We can share some.
- Oh, no.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.251
No, no, no, I'm good.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.919
No, please.
I don't want to eat.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.587
In fact,
I'm gonna get a table,

13:07.654 --> 13:08.755
'cause I need
to really spread out.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.258
But thank you.
I just-- I have a laptop

13:11.324 --> 13:13.626
and all this stuff,
so I'm gonna--

13:13.693 --> 13:15.162
Would you see
if there's a table?

13:15.228 --> 13:16.864
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.900
Can I have my check, please?
Can I have the check?

13:19.967 --> 13:23.003
I'm gonna go,
and you're gonna stay.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.571
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.573
I need a table anyway.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.141
I'm going.
You're staying.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.178
You're gonna have a nice day.
You deserve it.

13:31.244 --> 13:35.015
- And, um--
- I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.918
I just wanna be at a table
and spread out and do the work.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.552
- That's all.
- I got it.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.993
- Have a nice night.
- Thank you, Orrin.

** [rock]

14:01.741 --> 14:03.476
Hi. Sarah Pfefferman.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.912
Um, P-F.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.680
Hmm.
I don't see you here.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.950
Sarah Novak?

14:10.017 --> 14:12.019
I have a Len Novak
plus one.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.922
- Yeah, that's me.
- But they are already
checked in.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.961
Fuck.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.199
Poppy!

14:26.266 --> 14:29.736
- Mama! Hello!
- Hi.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.139
- These fuckers
are 25 bucks apiece.
- Okay.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.740
- Put the stubs in the bucket.
- Okay.

14:33.806 --> 14:37.044
- Put the bucket on.
- Okay. It's very festive.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.946
- Please try to sell half.
- I got it. Okay.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.347
- It's for the children.
- I got it.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.849
Children, tickets,
25 dollars each.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.385
Hey, you want
some raffle tickets?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.557
Nobody forced you to do it.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.495
Hi, Sarah. Hi.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.864
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi, Melanie.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.366
I'm good.
How are you?

14:59.432 --> 15:03.070
- I'm good.
- Nice to see you.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.972
I'm selling raffle tickets.
Do you guys want some?

15:04.972 --> 15:06.173
Hey, did you notice
a stain on the rug

15:06.239 --> 15:07.407
when you were
at the house last week?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.576
No. No, that's so--

15:09.642 --> 15:12.045
It's probably, like, kid's
tempera.
It'll come out.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.181
Melanie's missing
an eye shadow palette.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.483
- A what?
- An eye shadow palette.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.518
Eye shadow palette.
That's so weird.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.120
What's that?
I've never heard of that.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.654
What's an
eye shadow palette?

15:21.721 --> 15:23.991
It's a case
with all the colors.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.359
Wow. That must be why
your eyes are so pretty,

15:26.426 --> 15:29.696
- 'cause you have
all the colors.
- It's $485.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.398
- That's expensive.
- It's not important.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.166
- It's fine.
- I hope you find it.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.868
- Okay, thank you. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.604
Excuse me.
Can I just get
a drink, please?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.539
Thank you. Okay.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.274
[doorbell chimes]

15:41.341 --> 15:43.776
Raquel:
She's here!
Please come in.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.512
Hi! Here's your boy.

15:45.578 --> 15:50.017
Oh, this feels good.
It's great to see everybody.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.019
I would have
brought a bottle.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.720
Oh, please,
no worries.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.722
- Anything, we've got, um--
- I didn't have enough time.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.357
We could sit, or do--

15:57.424 --> 15:59.559
- Or I could have brought a--
- Snacks--

15:59.626 --> 16:01.461
- No, we're good.
- Oh, you know, pizza's here.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.596
- So why don't we just--
- Good, good, good.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.366
Good idea. Yeah, yeah.
Good. Here, go ahead.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.434
But--

16:07.500 --> 16:10.037
I saw spores around--
around the basement.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.171
- Spores?
- Yeah.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.707
Sort of like
hairy little animals

16:14.774 --> 16:16.243
but they're kind of pretty.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.944
- It's not black mold.
- Oh, I don't know.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.812
'Cause it's like nothing
I've seen before.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.148
Everybody thinks
it's black mold.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.515
It's probably not.
Trust me.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.284
- How do you know that?
- Is it on the sink side?

16:24.351 --> 16:26.419
I'm telling you.
Is it on the sink side
or the fridge side?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.955
- It's on the fridge side.
- It's probably not.

16:29.056 --> 16:33.526
I think it would be terrific if
you came over and took a look.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.096
- Um...
- That sounds like
a professional,

16:36.163 --> 16:37.630
like a professional
should be--

16:37.697 --> 16:40.533
Yeah, we'll call somebody
and we'll get them to come.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.870
I'll call somebody out.
I'll Yelp it.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.472
I don't want strangers
in my house.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.308
- I have to clean then.
- I could help out.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.809
Maybe I could
take a look at it.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.078
You just tell me
what to do.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.680
You don't know anything
about black mold.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.582
I'd love to learn.
You know?

16:55.648 --> 16:59.419
[humming]

17:04.857 --> 17:10.097
* One child grows up
to be somebody *

17:10.097 --> 17:12.332
* That just loves to learn *

17:12.399 --> 17:17.104
* And another child
grows up to be somebody *

17:17.104 --> 17:19.206
* You just love to burn *

17:19.272 --> 17:20.940
What are you doing?

17:21.007 --> 17:23.176
* Mom loves the both of them *

17:23.243 --> 17:24.777
* You see,
it's in the blood *

17:24.844 --> 17:26.713
Sly and the Family Stone.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.517
* It's a family affair *

17:30.583 --> 17:32.485
- Oh.
- Come on, sing. Yeah?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.122
I heard it on the radio
this morning.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.190
I thought it was apropos.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.993
* It's a family affair *

17:41.128 --> 17:42.629
Okay, all right,
that's enough.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.831
That's enough.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.170
Okay, party pooper.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.011
Okay. Dessert.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.381
Who wants some dessert?

18:02.615 --> 18:05.918
Raquel made a beautiful
peach pie with some--

18:05.985 --> 18:09.222
No, no, no, keep it here.
I'll take it home.
I'll box it up.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.192
Yeah, okay,
that's great.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.493
I love whipped cream.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.995
Yeah, I love
whipped cream, too.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.198
That woman is bat shit
fucking crazy.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.433
I don't want her
in this house.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.369
I-- We will never
do this again.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.637
I swear to God.
It's just for Colton.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.740
Just for Colton?

18:31.178 --> 18:33.480
I think Gershon
was Rose's brother.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.483
But it's all very murky.
They don't tell me anything.

18:36.549 --> 18:40.253
But where are they from?
Poland? Lithuania?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.489
My people,
we are from Latvia.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.291
My people
came from Germany--

18:44.357 --> 18:46.193
Berlin, and then
left in the 30s.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.561
That's Weimar.
That's like "Cabaret."

18:48.628 --> 18:50.563
But I think they were,
like, Polish peasants

18:50.630 --> 18:52.399
before they
got to Berlin.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.202
I need to get some family
deets into this essay.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.337
She only accepts three
grad students a year.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.772
I need to knock
those boxers off of Leslie.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.290
One.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.398
Welcome to the Institute
for Sexual Research,

19:25.465 --> 19:27.300
where we believe that
wide range of sexualities,

19:27.367 --> 19:29.236
including homosexuality,

19:29.302 --> 19:30.270
are normal.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.672
Cross-dressers,
transvestites

19:32.739 --> 19:36.108
hermaphrodites,
everyone is welcome here.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.577
Open-minded folks
such as yourselves

19:37.644 --> 19:39.512
can understand the need
for a safe haven

19:39.579 --> 19:41.248
for those of us who
are neither male nor female

19:41.314 --> 19:43.683
as you understand them.

19:43.750 --> 19:47.254
And this is our fearless leader,
Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld.

19:47.287 --> 19:51.057
You might also think of him
as the Isaac Newton of sex.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.525
Our hospital wing
is downstairs.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.161
But for now,
follow me to the library.

19:55.262 --> 19:58.465
So now that she's dead,
I just feel like you have
all these redhead girls

19:58.531 --> 20:00.667
running around town
trying to pay an homage,

20:00.733 --> 20:03.002
but to me
it's not an homage,
it's highway robbery.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.738
Do you see them?
They're doing exactly
what she did.

20:05.805 --> 20:06.739
They're not changing.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.809
[both speak Hebrew]

20:11.311 --> 20:13.980
Sit down. Chocolate?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.882
You look skinny.

20:17.284 --> 20:20.553
- We need money.
- Why?

20:20.620 --> 20:23.356
- Dad left.
- What do you mean,
just gone?

20:23.423 --> 20:27.026
He left.
And Mom wants to go find Dad

20:27.093 --> 20:29.396
in American states.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.398
And we need money
for boat tickets

20:31.464 --> 20:33.733
and a bribe for the visas.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.672
Oh, my God.
This shit is fascinating.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.108
Did you know there is such
a thing as inherited trauma

20:42.174 --> 20:43.242
in your actual DNA?

20:43.310 --> 20:44.544
No, I did not.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.245
They did this study
on bunnies

20:46.313 --> 20:47.547
where they give them
electric shocks

20:47.614 --> 20:49.148
where they were smelling
cherry blossoms

20:49.215 --> 20:50.950
and the bunnies' babies
and their babies,

20:51.017 --> 20:53.320
the grandbabies, they were
all afraid of cherry blossoms.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.455
That's a really mean thing
to do to bunnies.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.457
So it's like the bunnies
were in the cage watching

20:57.524 --> 20:58.725
while their grandparents
got shocked?

20:58.791 --> 20:59.992
No, they weren't
even born yet.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.528
They weren't
even conceived yet.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.130
They weren't even a twinkle
in the grandma bunny's eyes.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.165
- It was inherited in their DNA.
- Okay.

21:06.232 --> 21:10.470
It's incredible.
It's called epigenetics.

21:10.537 --> 21:13.706
Wait.
Say that again.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.375
But slower.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.379
Epigenetics.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.514
Yeah, like that.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.950
- Epigenetics.
- Yeah.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.352
Epigenetics.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.555
Like that butt up in the air.

21:28.621 --> 21:32.091
Thanks for being my study buddy
and coming to the library.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.994
You're welcome.

21:35.061 --> 21:38.498
Can I get you to wear these
husky plus waist sized jeans?

21:38.565 --> 21:42.469
- Who you calling husky plus?
- [chuckles]

21:42.535 --> 21:44.904
** [rock]

21:44.971 --> 21:47.073
Looking at
two more minutes

21:47.139 --> 21:49.041
to buy those raffle tickets!

21:49.108 --> 21:51.411
Just two!

21:51.478 --> 21:53.680
I'm sorry, Poppy,
I could only sell six.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.383
I really need you to sell,
like, 19 more, though.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.917
Look, I tried, okay?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.052
Everyone's bought them,
or I don't know what.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.422
Yeah, I know, sorry.
We're trying to get
organic school lunches.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.624
Okay, you know what?
Okay, okay, okay.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.426
I get it, I get it! Okay?
I will buy them myself.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.960
I'll just buy the 19,

22:08.027 --> 22:10.062
and you can just put it
on my credit card.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.399
Take that.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.966
Why don't
I fill them out?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.636
Okay? I'll just take these,
and I'll fill them out.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.138
- Okay. Thank you.
- Want a balloon?

22:19.205 --> 22:20.873
Oh. God.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.843
You're kind of ignoring me.
You don't have to do that.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.412
You can just totally
hang out with me,

22:25.412 --> 22:26.846
and it would be
a lot more fun.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.248
What is this?
Is that a neck tattoo?

22:29.315 --> 22:30.517
I am becoming.
You know, becoming.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.452
It's got, like,
a double entendre.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.620
You're drunk again,
aren't you?

22:33.686 --> 22:35.087
I have something I need
to tell you.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.423
- Why are you drinking?
- I need to tell you something.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.490
What do you have to tell me?

22:37.557 --> 22:38.725
I need to take you in the thing.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.528
Take my balloon.
You gotta come with me.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.766
Come on. Come on. Come on.

22:46.833 --> 22:52.104
I got my name in
under the wire.

22:52.171 --> 22:55.442
I am now officially
a candidate

22:55.442 --> 22:57.910
for president
of the condo board.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.447
Screw Rosalie Roman.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.214
Oh, my God.
Look at me.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.216
I'm a real live politician.
You didn't like it.

23:04.283 --> 23:07.353
Oh.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.690
Turkey meatballs were dry.
I should have cracked an egg.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.925
I knew I should have
cracked an egg.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.994
I said to myself, "Shelly--"
But you know what?

23:15.061 --> 23:17.063
I didn't want to
spend the money.
Is something wrong?

23:17.129 --> 23:20.533
You want your coffee?

23:20.600 --> 23:24.170
- What?
- You want me to warm it up?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.538
Here.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.944
- Let's watch some television.
- Okay.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.881
Here. What do you
wanna watch?

23:34.947 --> 23:37.083
I don't know.
You decide, okay?

23:37.149 --> 23:39.652
Okay. You want news
or something with a story?

23:39.719 --> 23:43.055
No, I-- You decide.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.591
Okay.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.293
- [TV on]
- Ooh, let's see.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.295
Ooh, that's--
What do you say?

23:49.361 --> 23:51.163
Oh, "Dancing With The Stars."

23:51.230 --> 23:54.000
- [TV plays]
- All right.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.503
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think?

23:56.569 --> 23:59.639
This is "Scandal."

23:59.706 --> 24:01.774
What do you want?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.142
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.344
I don't know what
I'm in the mood for.

24:05.411 --> 24:08.014
I can't tell.
All right.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.717
Oh, I like this.
This is good.
Is this good for you?

24:10.783 --> 24:13.252
Stop worrying
what's good for me, okay?

24:13.319 --> 24:14.754
I'm fine.
What do you want?

24:14.821 --> 24:17.590
Just choose something, okay?

24:17.657 --> 24:19.291
Just make a choice.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.694
Make yourself happy,

24:35.542 --> 24:37.544
What did you
want to tell me?

24:37.544 --> 24:39.245
What did you
want to tell me?

24:44.216 --> 24:45.552
What--

24:56.295 --> 24:57.764
I don't think this is okay.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.633
What are we--
Stop. What-- I can't--

25:00.700 --> 25:01.701

to take it home with you.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.075
I have, like, a really
small apartment, though.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.376
You can go down now.

25:44.443 --> 25:45.477

like, maybe, um--
- Totally--

26:13.840 --> 26:15.642

26:15.708 --> 26:18.377
'Cause I already--
I mean, if you wanna pick
somebody else.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.379
I really don't need
a life coach session.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.749
- No, she's great.
- I don't really care
if she's good.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.251
- I don't want
the life coach sessions.
- No, I need you to take this.

26:25.317 --> 26:29.021
I don't need-- I'm not fucking
taking the life coach sessions!

26:34.293 --> 26:37.964
