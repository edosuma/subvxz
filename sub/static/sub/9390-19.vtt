all be staying this weekend.

00:48.797 --> 00:50.298
You and I will have one cabin,

and Bonnie and Joe and Quagmire
will have the other two.

00:53.001 --> 00:55.361
Oh, this is going
to be so much fun!

00:56.271 --> 00:57.838
Hi, Chris.
How was school?

00:57.906 --> 01:01.376
Not good. I got suspended
for saying bad words.

01:01.443 --> 01:02.476
For God's sake!

01:02.544 --> 01:04.785
My principal wants
to meet with you guys.

01:04.812 --> 01:06.797
Should we go?
It sounds like a trap.

01:06.865 --> 01:08.433
Yes, Peter, we should go.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.168
All right, but if it's a trap,
and we don't come back,

01:10.235 --> 01:12.670
I get to make smart-alecky
remarks when we're tied up

01:12.737 --> 01:14.705
back-to-back,
like last time.

01:14.773 --> 01:17.691
Any more bright ideas,
Professor?

01:17.759 --> 01:19.027
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

01:20.762 --> 01:23.564
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, the
reason Chris was suspended

01:23.632 --> 01:26.417
is that he told a very
inappropriate joke in class.

01:26.484 --> 01:29.937
Well, Principal Shepherd, we
promise you it won't happen again.

01:30.005 --> 01:31.572
I don't know where
Chris heard the joke,

01:31.639 --> 01:34.441
but I can assure you, it wasn't at home.
Was it, Chris?

01:34.509 --> 01:36.543
No, Mr. Quagmire
told it to me.

01:36.611 --> 01:38.028
Oh, I should have figured.

01:38.096 --> 01:40.264
Was it the one where the blind
man walks by the fish market

01:40.331 --> 01:42.399
and says,
"Good morning, ladies?"

01:42.467 --> 01:44.235
(LAUGHS) I told you that one!

01:44.302 --> 01:45.302
You told me that one.

01:45.370 --> 01:46.437
I sure did.

01:46.505 --> 01:48.205
We enjoy each other's company.

01:53.313 --> 01:55.847
Hey, Quagmire, you know you got
Chris suspended from school

01:55.915 --> 01:57.416
for telling one
of your dirty jokes?

01:57.483 --> 01:59.951
Oh, gosh, Peter, I'm sorry.
You want me to talk to him?

02:00.019 --> 02:02.521
Well, no, actually, I want
you to tell me the joke.

02:02.588 --> 02:03.855
Yeah, tell us the joke.

02:03.923 --> 02:05.690
You want to hear it?
All right.

happens to other people.

02:24.110 --> 02:26.044
Ugh! That's the end
of those underwears.

02:26.112 --> 02:27.312
I didn't know what to do,

02:27.313 --> 02:28.946
so I took them off and
hummed them at the wall,

02:29.014 --> 02:31.749
and they started sliding down like
one of them sticky octopuses.

02:31.817 --> 02:32.901
Well, it's a pretty funny joke,

02:32.968 --> 02:35.320
you know, when you think about it.
Your vagina's in the sink.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.523
(LAUGHING) Damn it!

02:38.525 --> 02:41.276
Wow. He poops every time
he hears that joke.

He does, doesn't he?

all over the bed!

dreams, you poop for real.

Hello, fellas.

Hey, Pete. Hey,
those are my pants.

03:43.818 --> 03:46.854
That's right. Thought I'd come by and
see if you have any jokes to tell.

03:46.921 --> 03:47.955
I enjoy a joke.

03:48.022 --> 03:49.356
I don't know.

03:49.423 --> 03:51.458
I want to tell the joke,
but I like those pants.

03:51.526 --> 03:52.793
I'll tell the joke.

03:52.861 --> 03:54.011
Go ahead, Joe.
I'm all anus.

03:54.079 --> 03:56.447
Joe, don't you dare. I'll push
you straight into traffic.

03:56.515 --> 03:58.899
Peter, you win. All right, I
won't tell the joke anymore.

03:58.967 --> 04:02.102
You know, I gotta admit, Quagmire,
despite all the problems,

04:02.170 --> 04:04.739
that joke is freaking hilarious.
Where'd you hear it?

04:04.806 --> 04:06.173
Bruce told it to me.

04:06.241 --> 04:07.908
No way Bruce came up with that.
Where'd he hear it?

04:07.910 --> 04:09.477
I don't know.
Probably just around.

04:09.544 --> 04:11.846
I mean, where does
any dirty joke come from?

04:11.848 --> 04:13.580
Hey, now, Joe's right.
There's a million of them.

04:13.648 --> 04:15.048
They gotta be
coming from somewhere.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.917
Somebody's got to be
making these things up.

04:16.985 --> 04:18.985
Well, who?
I don't know.

04:18.987 --> 04:21.321
But haven't you ever
wanted to find out?

04:21.389 --> 04:23.791
Well, yeah, but how
would anyone do that?

04:23.858 --> 04:25.475
A quest, Joe.

04:25.543 --> 04:28.879
We go on a quest to find the
source of the world's dirty jokes.

Well, I'm with you.

we're not here to bowl.

that dirty joke you told Quagmire.

04:48.349 --> 04:50.000
Oh, that one? Oh, no.

04:50.067 --> 04:52.603
I'm not going to tell y'all
that one here at the workplace.

04:52.670 --> 04:54.638
Too dirty. Maybe
after quitting time,

04:54.706 --> 04:56.940
I'll have a mimosa
and tell y'all then.

04:56.942 --> 04:59.627
Look, you blade, just tell
us who you heard it from.

04:59.629 --> 05:02.145

saved us several stops,</i>

05:28.823 --> 05:31.891
<i>as they, too, had backtracked
the joke to some extent.</i>

05:31.959 --> 05:35.011
<i>But when their trail had led to a

05:35.079 --> 05:37.381

leave in the morning.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.757
Yeah, Peter,
we've looked long enough.

06:06.778 --> 06:08.545
Maybe the joke doesn't
have a source.

06:08.547 --> 06:10.631
Don't be stupid. Somebody
had to have made it up.

06:10.699 --> 06:11.948
And we're going
to find out who.

06:12.016 --> 06:13.667
Besides, this will
be way more fun

06:13.735 --> 06:16.637
than hanging out in Maine with the
wives, sitting around a campfire,

06:16.705 --> 06:19.172
listening to Lois
tell grocery stories.

is, but you know what I'm saying.

Okay, Peter, I've got the directions.
Head north on the turnpike.

That's going to be the
quickest route to Maine.

06:44.565 --> 06:45.732
Sure, Lois.

06:49.571 --> 06:52.122
Say, ladies, I was wondering
if you could tell me,

06:52.189 --> 06:53.857
what was childbirth like?

06:53.925 --> 06:58.595
Oh, Glenn, you have no idea. It's
something no man could understand.

06:58.663 --> 07:02.032
Think of the most intense
pain you've ever felt

07:02.099 --> 07:04.868
and imagine feeling that
for hours.

07:04.936 --> 07:06.270
LOIS: Well, and then,
by the eighth month,

07:06.337 --> 07:09.239
I had hemorrhoids that
hung like bunches of grapes.

07:09.307 --> 07:13.026
BONNIE: <i>And then, they said I
was four centimeters dilated.</i>

07:13.028 --> 07:14.389
They didn't think
I was far enough,

07:14.428 --> 07:17.898
but I was like, "I can
tell you I'm far enough."

07:17.966 --> 07:20.534
LOIS: And that's
when Chris was born.

07:20.601 --> 07:23.687
Gosh, that's all so fascinating.
Let me ask you something else.

07:23.754 --> 07:26.190
Have you girls ever worked in
an office with other women

07:26.257 --> 07:28.125
who you have
negative things to say about?

07:28.193 --> 07:29.693
Oh, God, yes.
Oh, my God.

07:29.695 --> 07:31.815
Quagmire, shut up.
We're here.

07:33.898 --> 07:35.666
You drove us to Virginia?

All right, look, we're sorry
we deceived you girls,

07:37.468 --> 07:38.952
but this is important.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.172
The trail leads to a
bartender who works here.

07:42.174 --> 07:44.815
He could be the source
of the dirty joke.

07:51.766 --> 07:53.934
Hi, there. What can I
do for you gentlemen?

07:53.936 --> 07:57.087
We've traveled a very long way to
find out where you heard this joke.

07:57.722 --> 08:00.457
Oh! (WHEEZING LAUGH)

08:00.525 --> 08:02.909
I remember that.
I heard it from that guy.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.246
Cleveland?

08:06.314 --> 08:07.431
Hey, fellas.

08:07.498 --> 08:10.116
Holy crap! Who knew
we'd run into you here?

08:10.184 --> 08:12.653

ruined it in the promos.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.554
What a surprise this is!

08:18.993 --> 08:21.662
Donna, it's so nice of you
to invite us to stay here.

I don't think we've seen
you folks since the wedding.

Still waiting on that gift.

08:27.735 --> 08:29.887
The gift was the show.

08:29.954 --> 08:31.889
Nah, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

08:31.956 --> 08:33.857
It's great to
have y'all down here.

08:33.859 --> 08:36.159
Hey, you know, Cleveland, you better
hide the markers from your kids.

08:36.227 --> 08:37.645
Somebody colored in your Jesus.

08:37.712 --> 08:40.980
Somebody colored in your ass
with too much ass, fat-ass.

08:40.982 --> 08:42.499
All right, Cleveland,
let's get down to business.

08:42.567 --> 08:43.734
Who told you the joke?

08:43.801 --> 08:47.471
A bellhop at the Royale
Hotel in Washington, DC.

08:47.538 --> 08:51.341
I met him when I took Cleveland Jr.
there to see the Lincoln Memorial.

08:51.409 --> 08:54.261
But then Daddy got frustrated
'cause he couldn't find it,

08:54.328 --> 08:56.763
so we just ate fast food
in the parking lot.

08:56.765 --> 08:58.949
I'm just saying, maybe
put up a damn sign.

08:59.017 --> 09:01.977
Anyway, the bellhop's
name is Sal Russo.

09:02.020 --> 09:04.521
He knows every
dirty joke ever written.

09:04.589 --> 09:06.523
Then that's the guy
we got to talk to.

09:06.590 --> 09:09.059
Everyone, don't get too used
to being around black people,

09:09.126 --> 09:11.528
'cause we are going to
Washington, DC.

09:11.530 --> 09:12.913
Now, wait a minute, Peter.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.515
Donna's been nice enough to
invite us to stay the weekend,

09:15.582 --> 09:18.718
and frankly, that sounds better than
continuing this wild-goose chase.

09:18.786 --> 09:21.171
Well, Lois, if you and
Bonnie want to stay here,

09:21.239 --> 09:23.140
maybe Cleveland could join us.

09:23.142 --> 09:25.903
Yeah, it'd be just like old times.
What do you say, Cleveland?

09:25.943 --> 09:29.162
Oh, I don't know. I've kind
of got my own life now.

09:29.164 --> 09:30.763
All right, if you have
a sudden change of heart,

09:30.831 --> 09:33.311
and you want to chase us down the
street as we're pulling away,

09:33.334 --> 09:34.767
you know where to find us.

09:48.082 --> 09:49.916
Okay, guys, I got one.

09:49.984 --> 09:55.255
Would you rather get a massage from a
man, or surgery from a female doctor?

09:55.323 --> 09:57.607
Wow.
Like, minor surgery?

09:57.609 --> 10:00.227
No, serious surgery. Like a
blown kidney or something.

10:00.294 --> 10:02.479
Geez.
Good question, Peter.

10:02.546 --> 10:03.847
Is the man gay?
No.

10:03.915 --> 10:06.282
Is the female doctor
at least Jewish or Asian?

10:06.350 --> 10:07.630
No, but, actually,
you know what?

10:07.652 --> 10:10.087
I'm going to take it up a notch.
Hispanic female doctor

10:10.154 --> 10:11.655
or gay male masseuse?

10:11.723 --> 10:13.356
Hispanic from Spain?

10:13.424 --> 10:14.584
No.

10:14.592 --> 10:16.259
(ALL GROANING)

10:16.327 --> 10:19.896
So, it's basically, would you rather
get a massage from a gay man or die?

10:19.898 --> 10:20.797
All right, I got another one.

10:20.865 --> 10:22.899
Let Amy Winehouse
spit in your mouth,

10:22.967 --> 10:25.636
or eat a raw slice of
Anderson Cooper's ass?

10:25.703 --> 10:27.504
Sign me up for Cooper.

10:27.572 --> 10:28.922
(GUNSHOT)
(ALL SCREAMING)

10:28.990 --> 10:30.157
What the hell?

10:43.604 --> 10:45.606
What the hell was that about?
Who were those guys?

10:45.673 --> 10:47.441
I don't know,
but I'll tell you this.

10:47.508 --> 10:50.176
I saw one of them back
in the bar in Stoolbend.

10:50.244 --> 10:51.744
You think they
were following us?

10:51.812 --> 10:54.581
Either that, or they got a grudge
against our back windshield.

10:54.648 --> 10:56.032
Joe, that's so dumb.

10:56.034 --> 10:58.001
Why would anybody
be trying to kill us?

10:58.003 --> 11:01.371
It might be safe to assume that
someone does not want us to learn

11:01.439 --> 11:03.473
the origin of that joke.

11:03.541 --> 11:06.376
PETER: <i>We had no idea how
right Cleveland was.</i>

11:06.443 --> 11:08.428
<i>And if we had known</i>
<i>what lay ahead,</i>

11:08.496 --> 11:12.132
<i>we would've stopped right there,
and gone straight back to Quahog.</i>

11:12.134 --> 11:13.800
<i>But we didn't know.</i>

11:13.867 --> 11:15.547
(WHISPERS DRAMATICALLY)
<i>We didn't know.</i>

11:20.541 --> 11:22.742
There it is.
Washington, DC,

11:22.810 --> 11:26.363
the seat of government for the
world's former most powerful nation.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.749
Wow, those are all the monuments
I read about in school.

11:28.816 --> 11:30.536
There's the
Washington Monument.

11:31.052 --> 11:33.153
There's the Obama Monument.

11:34.789 --> 11:36.690
And there's the
Vietnam War Memorial.

11:36.757 --> 11:37.974
Yeah, check out
that Vietnamese guy

11:38.042 --> 11:40.110
giving the business
to those Vietnam vets.

11:40.178 --> 11:41.595
Scoreboard!

11:41.662 --> 11:45.431
Scoreboard! Aw! What
happened to your friend?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.233
Hey, I know that guy!
I kill him!

11:47.301 --> 11:51.270
He cry like a bitch!
Vietnam, undefeated!

11:56.860 --> 11:59.946
All right, this is the hotel
where the bellhop works.

12:06.053 --> 12:09.055
Hey, there he is. Sal!

12:09.123 --> 12:11.207
Well, hey, Cleveland!
What are you doing here?

12:11.276 --> 12:15.162
I was wondering if my friends and
I could ask you a few questions.

12:15.164 --> 12:18.031
Yeah, where'd you hear that
dirty joke you told Cleveland?

12:18.098 --> 12:20.099
That's none of your business.
Leave me alone!

12:20.868 --> 12:22.469
Don't let him get away!

12:27.508 --> 12:28.792
(HORN BLARING)

12:29.761 --> 12:30.960
Hop on!

12:40.388 --> 12:41.537
Where did he go?

12:41.605 --> 12:44.040
I think he went that way,
past the Reflecting Pool!

12:46.310 --> 12:48.478
Damn! He's nowhere in sight.

12:48.545 --> 12:50.346
I'll ask these fellas.
Maybe they've seen him.

12:50.381 --> 12:51.848
Excuse me, have you seen...

12:51.915 --> 12:53.450
Hold on a second.
I'm trying...

12:53.518 --> 12:56.953
Hold on a sec. Hey, pal, stop talking
while I'm talking, all right?

12:57.021 --> 12:59.055
You want a sandwich full of knuckles?
Do you?

12:59.123 --> 13:00.923
All right, that's it.
Cleveland, you take Cleveland.

13:00.991 --> 13:03.326
Joe, you take Joe.
Quagmire, you take Quagmire,

13:03.394 --> 13:05.362
and I'll get Fatty McLoudmouth.

13:10.651 --> 13:12.652
It's no use, Peter.

13:12.719 --> 13:14.487
We've lost him.

13:14.555 --> 13:17.857
PETER: <i>Our journey had abruptly
ended, and the trail had gone cold.</i>

13:20.611 --> 13:23.547
Well, I guess we're never gonna
find the source of that joke.

13:23.614 --> 13:26.583
I guess there's nothing to
do now but head back home.

13:26.651 --> 13:28.367
Stop right where you are!
(ALL GASP)

13:28.435 --> 13:29.286
Down on the ground!

13:31.439 --> 13:33.039
PETER: <i>We were all terrified</i>

13:33.107 --> 13:35.241
<i>that this would prove to be an
unexpected end to our journey.</i>

13:35.309 --> 13:38.845
<i>But little did we know, our
journey was far from over.</i>

13:46.620 --> 13:48.404
All right, did you get
the parking validated?

13:48.472 --> 13:50.106
Ugh! No.

13:50.174 --> 13:53.614
(SIGHS) That was the whole reason
we walked through Crate & Barrel.

13:56.597 --> 13:59.265
PETER: <i>We'd been captured,
tied up, and kidnapped.</i>

13:59.333 --> 14:02.535
<i>And as if that weren't bad enough,
we found ourselves on a plane,</i>

14:02.603 --> 14:04.671
<i>headed to</i>
<i>an unknown destination.</i>

14:04.738 --> 14:06.206
Where the hell
are they taking us?

14:06.274 --> 14:08.724
I don't know,
but I got a bad feeling.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.626
(BABY CRYING)

14:10.694 --> 14:13.163
Ah! Every plane, every plane,

14:13.230 --> 14:15.991
there's gotta be a crying baby
and a mother ignoring it.

14:16.567 --> 14:20.136
Yes, he's crying.
Babies cry.

14:20.204 --> 14:22.338
PETER: <i>After flying for</i>
<i>what seemed like hours,</i>

14:22.407 --> 14:26.309
<i>we found ourselves approaching a
strange island on the horizon.</i>

15:08.202 --> 15:09.819
What the hell is this place?

15:09.887 --> 15:12.455
It is that which you have
been seeking, gentlemen.

15:12.523 --> 15:13.873
Who are you?

15:13.940 --> 15:14.958
I am the dean.

15:15.025 --> 15:16.275
The dean of what?

15:16.343 --> 15:20.130
The Dean of the Secret Order
of Dirty Joke Writers.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.970
Wow.

15:27.038 --> 15:30.323
So, these are the people who write
all the world's dirty jokes?

15:30.391 --> 15:31.624
Indeed they are.

15:31.692 --> 15:33.326
Hey, isn't that Stephen Hawking?

15:33.328 --> 15:35.978
<i>So the housewife</i>
<i>tells the plumber,</i>

15:36.046 --> 15:41.351
<i>"Okay, you cleaned my pipes,</i>
<i>now get to work on that sink."</i>

15:41.418 --> 15:42.952
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:44.355 --> 15:45.588
And there's Bill Gates!

15:45.656 --> 15:48.925
Is there some joke area of
a beaver eating a woodpecker?

15:48.993 --> 15:50.527
Is that something?
Would that work?

15:50.638 --> 15:53.707
Wow. These are some of the
world's smartest people.

15:53.775 --> 15:54.576
Not a lot of women.

15:54.642 --> 15:57.360
Yeah, not a lot of women.

15:57.428 --> 15:59.029
What are they all doing here?

15:59.097 --> 16:03.133
Well, many of the world's greatest
geniuses secretly devote themselves

16:03.200 --> 16:05.769
to coming up with
the world's dirtiest jokes.

16:05.837 --> 16:07.687
It's been that
way for centuries.

16:07.755 --> 16:10.224
Great men such as Ben Franklin,

16:10.291 --> 16:12.426
Charles Dickens,
Albert Einstein.

16:12.494 --> 16:14.261
Shakespeare, of course.

16:14.329 --> 16:15.729
I got a spear you can shake.

16:15.796 --> 16:18.132
Ha! There you go, put that
in one of your jokes.

16:18.199 --> 16:19.783
Let me show you around.

16:21.853 --> 16:26.073
From this room, we can see the
entire world's joke supply.

16:26.075 --> 16:29.176
This way we can tailor jokes
to where the need is greatest.

16:29.243 --> 16:31.494
Sir, we have a best man
giving a toast at a wedding,

16:31.562 --> 16:32.996
and he is just bombing.

16:33.064 --> 16:35.849
Put it up on the screen.

16:35.917 --> 16:41.338
<i>Jim's so clumsy, it's like he's
got two left feet and left hands.</i>

16:42.840 --> 16:45.292
Permission to go to the
"Bride is a whore" file, sir.

16:45.359 --> 16:47.727
Permission granted.

it would read "Open Trench."</i>

Well, gentlemen, I hope you've
enjoyed the tour of our facility.

17:04.179 --> 17:06.863
This was amazing!
Guys, we did it!

17:06.931 --> 17:09.800
We found the source of
the world's dirty jokes!

17:09.802 --> 17:12.269
I can't wait to tell all
the guys back at the Clam!

17:12.337 --> 17:15.772
Oh, I'm afraid
that's quite impossible.

17:15.857 --> 17:16.957
What do you mean?

17:17.025 --> 17:19.293
Well, you've seen
our secret island.

17:19.295 --> 17:22.145
You know about our network
of joke distribution agents,

17:22.213 --> 17:23.513
like the bellhop.

17:23.581 --> 17:25.882
We can't allow the
secret to be revealed.

17:25.950 --> 17:29.586
I'm afraid you must stay here
for the rest of your lives.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.934
What are we gonna do now?

17:44.001 --> 17:46.219
We gotta come up
with an escape plan.

17:49.523 --> 17:52.409
Hey, guys, I can see the
plane that brought us here!

17:52.477 --> 17:54.978
If we can figure out a way to
get to it, I can fly us home!

17:55.045 --> 17:56.679
I got an idea.

17:56.747 --> 17:58.848
One of us should pretend we're
hurt, and when the guards come in

17:58.916 --> 18:01.285
to give him medical
attention, we'll jump them.

18:01.352 --> 18:02.435
That's perfect, Joe.

18:02.503 --> 18:03.837
Hey, Cleveland, you
got a pencil on you?

18:03.905 --> 18:05.172
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

18:05.239 --> 18:07.023
Oh, wait, here you go.
Thanks.

18:07.091 --> 18:08.658
(SCREAMS) What the hell?

18:08.726 --> 18:11.328

We have an emergency!

You dick!

18:12.698 --> 18:14.047
What's going on in here?

18:14.114 --> 18:16.516
This man has been injured!
He needs medical attention!

18:20.338 --> 18:22.018
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

18:27.161 --> 18:29.479
All right, let's hurry up
and find a way out!

18:36.753 --> 18:38.572
(GASPING)

18:38.639 --> 18:43.193
Well, well, it's quite clear the four
of you are going to be a problem.

18:43.260 --> 18:44.978
Kill them.

18:47.298 --> 18:49.566
My God, I've done it.

18:49.634 --> 18:52.102
After 80 years of
work and research,

18:52.169 --> 18:56.556
I have written the greatest dirty
joke in the history of mankind!

18:56.591 --> 18:57.924
(LAUGHING)

19:00.211 --> 19:01.277

19:08.052 --> 19:10.337
Give me that!
Not on your life!

Take one step closer,
and the paper gets it.

19:14.508 --> 19:16.643
Drop your guns!
Do as he says!

19:25.903 --> 19:29.489
Put it out!
Put it out!

19:29.556 --> 19:34.094
Oh, my God! It's heading for the
first dead baby joke ever written!

20:11.666 --> 20:13.500
QUAGMIRE: Look what we did.

20:13.568 --> 20:18.120
We destroyed a place that brought joy
and laughter to the entire world.

20:18.122 --> 20:20.089
Is that the end
of all dirty jokes?

20:20.091 --> 20:21.591
Well, maybe it is.

20:21.658 --> 20:24.527
But Peter's got the best one
ever written right there.

20:24.595 --> 20:26.213
Read it, Peter.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.748
"Guess what? Chicken butt."

20:28.816 --> 20:31.017
That's it?
That's the joke?

20:31.085 --> 20:32.985
No, this is the joke!

20:33.053 --> 20:34.454
(SCREAMS)

20:34.521 --> 20:37.290
Now take me back to Virginia, so I
can put some Bacitracin on this

20:37.358 --> 20:38.691
and pork my wife!

20:47.401 --> 20:49.135
PETER:
<i>It was a great adventure.</i>

20:49.203 --> 20:51.705
<i>And it was great having</i>
<i>Cleveland along with us again.</i>

20:51.772 --> 20:55.007
<i>He hasn't changed a bit.</i>
<i>Didn't grab one check.</i>

20:55.075 --> 20:59.412
<i>Anyway, that's our story about the
splendid source of all dirty jokes.</i>

20:59.480 --> 21:01.321
<i>For those of you who stuck
around till the end,</i>

21:01.349 --> 21:02.949
<i>you deserve a reward.</i>

21:03.016 --> 21:06.770
<i>So here's some footage of
an ape scratching himself.</i>

21:06.837 --> 21:10.607
<i>See, the March of Dimes wanted this air time
to talk about cancer kids or something,</i>

21:10.675 --> 21:12.875
<i>but I was like,</i>
<i>"No way! Monkey scratch!"</i>
