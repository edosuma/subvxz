You should have been
in school today, Christina,

02:26.386 --> 02:27.185
and every other day.

02:27.187 --> 02:28.486
You'll never catch me,
Inspector Clark.

02:28.488 --> 02:30.955
That's what they all say.
I'll catch you, all right,

02:30.957 --> 02:33.858
and I'll tell the judge to
send you off to Cuan Mhuire,

02:33.860 --> 02:36.360
the old nuns will teach you
manners there.

02:36.362 --> 02:38.863

02:43.503 --> 02:47.472
One, two, yeah.

02:55.481 --> 02:58.983
Well? I won a singing
competition, Dad.

02:58.985 --> 03:00.418
I got a voucher for my dress.

03:00.420 --> 03:01.853
You are going to be a big star.

03:01.855 --> 03:04.789
Do you promise me? Of course I do.
You have a great talent.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.357
And you didn't
lick it off the stones.

03:06.359 --> 03:09.160
Here, did I ever tell yous
about the time,

03:09.162 --> 03:12.196
I won the All Ireland boxing?

03:12.198 --> 03:13.064
Daddy was on the ropes.

03:13.066 --> 03:16.234
CHRISTINA: Yeah, Dad.
Hilda Brannigan had a weakness,

03:16.236 --> 03:19.504
so I punched him hard
in the ribs.

03:19.506 --> 03:21.005
And he looks at me,

03:21.007 --> 03:24.509
he starts to stagger sideways,

03:24.511 --> 03:27.411
Then the coup de grace, boom...

03:28.013 --> 03:29.347
and he goes down,

03:29.349 --> 03:30.381
like a bleeding stone.

03:30.383 --> 03:33.284
And that made you champion,
did it, Dad?

03:33.286 --> 03:34.552
It did. Come on, get up.

03:34.554 --> 03:36.888
Could have gone to America
myself after that.

03:36.890 --> 03:38.556
All the promoters
were interested.

03:38.558 --> 03:39.924
Why didn't you go, Dad?

03:39.926 --> 03:42.827
Because I met your ma,
and that was the end of me.

03:42.829 --> 03:45.062
( laughs ) Come on you.

03:45.064 --> 03:49.000
If we don't get home,
she'll think we did a bunk.

04:00.279 --> 04:01.512
Come on, Christina.

04:01.514 --> 04:05.049
If we don't go now,
they'll be sold out.

04:05.051 --> 04:07.151
( Indistinct chatter )

04:10.055 --> 04:11.055
Be careful there, Christina.

04:11.057 --> 04:13.958
Don't worry about me,
Mrs. Doyle.

04:18.897 --> 04:21.065
Aw, good girl.

04:30.909 --> 04:31.909
Thanks, love.

04:31.911 --> 04:33.344
I don't know
what happened to me there.

04:33.346 --> 04:39.050
It must have been the excitement

I'm not hungry, Mum.

05:30.370 --> 05:33.304

you could eat a horse.

05:33.306 --> 05:34.205
That was an hour ago.

attendance inspector,

19:30.932 --> 19:34.500

( door closes )

21:10.631 --> 21:14.100
Don't worry about those
frightsy bitches of nuns.

21:14.102 --> 21:17.070
I'll show you how to beat them.

21:19.006 --> 21:21.507
( Rain pouring )

21:48.469 --> 21:50.803
( sheep bleating )

21:53.507 --> 21:56.509
Come on, Christina, quickly.

22:09.089 --> 22:10.923
They're gone.

( laughter )

23:58.565 --> 24:01.601
Christina, you can come in now.

24:03.103 --> 24:04.637
Take a seat.

24:06.273 --> 24:08.741
Well, you're a tonic,
Mr. Brendan.

24:08.743 --> 24:10.543
You really are.

24:11.545 --> 24:14.914
Now, Christina, I hope you
said thank you to Mr. Brendan

24:14.916 --> 24:15.915
for returning you safely

24:15.917 --> 24:18.951
from your little farlay
into the great beyond.

24:18.953 --> 24:20.686
Thank you again, Mr. Brendan.

24:20.688 --> 24:22.588
He tells me
that you have a great talent.

24:22.590 --> 24:26.526
Want to be nurtured carefully
at this tender age mind.

24:26.528 --> 24:27.827
What with the potential
to blossom

24:27.829 --> 24:31.898
into a wonderful national,
even international career.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.834
Where did you say you had
your contacts, Mr. Brendan?

24:34.836 --> 24:37.737
The Royal Albert Hall
in London,

24:37.739 --> 24:39.906
Radio City in New York.

24:39.908 --> 24:40.940
The Conservatoire in Paris.

24:40.942 --> 24:44.744
Oh, yes, we mustn't forget
the Conservatoire.

24:44.746 --> 24:46.979
There's only one problem.

24:47.114 --> 24:49.749
What's that, Mother Superior?

24:49.751 --> 24:51.150
That... That is...

24:51.152 --> 24:55.321
That is that your name
isn't Doris Day, is it?

24:55.323 --> 24:58.624
CHRISTINA: <i> Do you actually</i>
<i>love those people?</i>

24:58.626 --> 25:02.762
<i>Because I won't be a friend</i>
<i>for much longer if you do.</i>

25:02.764 --> 25:04.630
<i>I know I should forgive them</i>

25:04.632 --> 25:06.265
<i>but I'm not going to.</i>

25:06.267 --> 25:07.633
<i>I'm going to stand up to them.</i>

25:07.635 --> 25:10.336
<i>An eye for an eye,</i>
<i>a tooth for a tooth,</i>

25:10.338 --> 25:11.704
<i>a slap for a slap.</i>

25:11.706 --> 25:13.105
<i>Isn't that what you said</i>

25:13.107 --> 25:14.874
<i>about something</i>
<i>that got in your way?</i>

25:14.876 --> 25:17.877
<i>Don't worry, I wasn't</i>
<i>really gonna hit them.</i>

25:17.879 --> 25:21.113
<i>It's just that you know</i>
<i>what's going on in my head.</i>

25:21.115 --> 25:23.950
<i>I know I've taken</i>
<i>a few bad knocks.</i>

25:23.952 --> 25:25.785
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>that was your fault.</i>

25:25.787 --> 25:28.688
<i>Because I know you've got</i>

25:28.690 --> 25:30.623
<i>in store for me.</i>

25:33.193 --> 25:33.926
( bell tinkles )

25:33.928 --> 25:36.896
Hey, Irish,
you left your book behind.

25:36.898 --> 25:38.931
I'll pick it up later.

25:40.334 --> 25:43.002
Okay, in you go.

25:43.004 --> 25:44.737
Excuse me...

25:51.812 --> 25:52.945
Floor moving.

25:52.947 --> 25:56.015
Yeah, going up in the world.

26:01.088 --> 26:02.855
That's lovely, thank you.

26:02.857 --> 26:05.324
( Kids chattering
and laughing )

26:08.862 --> 26:11.631
( speaking in foreign language )

26:22.409 --> 26:25.878
( speaking in Vietnamese )

26:27.781 --> 26:29.682
It's great, Meiyang.

26:31.151 --> 26:34.687
( Giggling )

26:47.034 --> 26:49.301
Okay, out we go.

26:52.105 --> 26:55.207
Not allowed to bring
these <i> bui doi</i> children

26:55.209 --> 26:57.143
into the hotel. Why not?

26:57.145 --> 27:00.379
Do you not like Vietnamese
people staying here?

27:01.748 --> 27:03.115
Thank you.

27:21.301 --> 27:23.436
( Distant shouting )

27:47.160 --> 27:49.261

27:52.065 --> 27:53.199
<i>Xin chao.</i>

27:53.201 --> 27:56.268
( singing in foreign language )

28:01.842 --> 28:05.377
Is that another glass
half empty I see?

28:05.379 --> 28:06.412
Hello again.

28:06.414 --> 28:08.748
Can I buy you a refill?

28:08.750 --> 28:10.349
Sure, why not.

28:13.153 --> 28:15.187
( Applause )

28:17.124 --> 28:18.858
There's a place called Can Tho,

28:18.860 --> 28:21.961
which is like a sort of Venice
in Mekong Delta.

28:21.963 --> 28:25.264
It's quite a site.
You should go there.

28:25.266 --> 28:26.332
To Venice?

28:26.334 --> 28:27.233
No, to Can Tho.

28:27.235 --> 28:31.103
It's only about a day's drive.
Don't worry, I'm going.

28:31.105 --> 28:32.538
I'm going to see
all of Vietnam.

28:32.540 --> 28:35.241
Well, do it before the place
gets developed to death.

28:35.243 --> 28:38.144
It was once the Americans
with their trade embargo,

28:38.146 --> 28:41.113
whoosh, same, same
as everywhere else.

28:41.115 --> 28:44.049
Is that what you're here for,
David, whoosh?

28:44.051 --> 28:46.051
I'm a businessman, Christina.

28:46.053 --> 28:48.821
We all have to take
what we can get.

28:48.023 --> 28:49.356
Do we?

28:49.358 --> 28:50.757
( Smirks )

28:50.759 --> 28:52.726
I think we do.

28:57.565 --> 28:59.699
( Speaking in foreign language )

29:07.508 --> 29:09.376
Stand back now, kids.

29:09.378 --> 29:11.444
Very, very hot, hot.

29:16.117 --> 29:18.051
Vietnamese fish and chips.

29:18.053 --> 29:20.220
Do you want salt and vinegar
on those?

29:20.222 --> 29:22.255
( Cheering )

29:40.074 --> 29:41.107
CHRISTINA: Whoa.

29:41.109 --> 29:43.076
Okay, let's go.

29:43.677 --> 29:45.779
Oh, it's perfect.

29:45.781 --> 29:48.048
Let's get places.

29:55.523 --> 29:57.690
You are a tourist, Tina?

29:57.692 --> 29:59.259
No, not a tourist.

29:59.261 --> 30:00.093
What do you do?

30:00.095 --> 30:03.129
I'm just a mother, mama.

30:03.131 --> 30:04.297
Mama Tina?

30:04.299 --> 30:06.533
Yes, Mama Tina.

30:06.535 --> 30:08.802
Mama Tina, Lam.

30:08.804 --> 30:11.771
Hello, Lam,
it's good to meet you.

30:11.773 --> 30:13.740
Where is your family?

30:13.742 --> 30:16.209
Don't know. Where are yours?

30:16.211 --> 30:18.678
Well, my children
are in London.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.579
They are grown up now.

30:19.581 --> 30:21.514
They don't need
Mama Tina anymore?

30:21.516 --> 30:24.584
No, only
when they get into trouble.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.519
Do you have
brothers and sisters?

30:26.521 --> 30:28.688
Two brothers, are <i> bui doi</i> also,

30:28.690 --> 30:30.490
but I don't know
where they are.

30:30.492 --> 30:33.626
What does it mean this <i> bui doi</i> ?

30:33.628 --> 30:36.229
It means "dust of life."

30:36.231 --> 30:37.797
The dust beneath your soles.

30:37.799 --> 30:42.435
Ah, I was <i> bui doi</i> also
when I was young.

30:42.437 --> 30:43.670
No.

30:43.672 --> 30:44.537
Yes.

30:44.539 --> 30:46.406
( Truck honking )

30:46.408 --> 30:47.407
Oh, my God!

30:47.409 --> 30:49.142
( Kids screaming )

30:52.613 --> 30:54.614
What the hell do you think
you are doing?

30:54.616 --> 30:56.249
They are not allowed
in my shop!

30:56.251 --> 30:58.384
Those children are with me,
they are my guests.

30:58.386 --> 31:02.322
But your guests
will ruin my business.

31:07.761 --> 31:09.662
Tell me, Mrs. Noble,

31:09.664 --> 31:12.599
do you know of any city
in the world

31:12.601 --> 31:15.535
where people
want to see the streets

31:15.537 --> 31:18.805
ruled by vagrant children?

31:18.807 --> 31:20.273
No, inspector.

31:20.275 --> 31:21.474
So what makes you,

31:21.476 --> 31:24.177
a woman
newly arrived from Europe,

31:24.179 --> 31:27.147
think that we should
give up our city

31:27.149 --> 31:28.314
to this <i> bui doi</i> ?

31:28.316 --> 31:29.449
I don't.

31:29.451 --> 31:31.885
But when I was young
I was also homeless,

31:31.887 --> 31:34.420
without the protection
of parents.

31:34.422 --> 31:39.225
An Irish gutter is the same
as a Vietnamese gutter.

31:39.227 --> 31:41.661
I know how hard it is.

31:41.663 --> 31:42.695
Really?

31:42.697 --> 31:44.664
You must have been
a good beggar.

31:44.666 --> 31:47.567
I've never begged for anything
in my life, inspector.

31:47.569 --> 31:49.502
I always worked
when I was <i> bui doi</i>.

31:49.504 --> 31:52.772
But at least I was allowed
to spend my money in a chipper

31:52.774 --> 31:55.441
or an ice cream shop
without being thrown out.

31:55.443 --> 31:58.945
Mrs. Noble, you are here
on a tourist visa.

31:58.947 --> 32:02.882
And you behave
as if you have a work permit.

32:02.884 --> 32:04.918
If I find
that you have violated

32:04.920 --> 32:07.820
the terms of your visa
once more

32:07.822 --> 32:12.825
you could be deported
and barred from Vietnam.

Well, I'm good.

32:58.807 --> 32:59.639
Do you mean that?

32:59.641 --> 33:02.642
They made me a farmer up the
brewery, took the pledge,

33:02.644 --> 33:05.945
haven't had a drink
in a year and a half.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.381
Look at you,

Don't worry, Christina.

33:17.826 --> 33:20.526
Come on, I'll treat you

33:20.528 --> 33:24.864
The nuns gave me £5
to start me out in the world.

33:27.601 --> 33:28.768
I'm gonna get a job

33:28.770 --> 33:30.436
save up for singing lessons.

33:30.438 --> 33:32.272
Then I might be able
to make a goal of it,

33:32.274 --> 33:33.339
you know, professionally.

33:33.341 --> 33:35.308
Didn't I always say
that was your destiny.

33:35.310 --> 33:37.677
Be fair to you, Dad, it is.

33:37.679 --> 33:38.444
Oh, now

33:38.446 --> 33:40.580
there's a load of new houses
going up in Cromet.

33:40.582 --> 33:43.483
I'll get our name
down on the corporation list.

33:43.485 --> 33:46.519
We'll get your brothers
and sisters back,

33:46.521 --> 33:48.021
be a family again.

33:48.023 --> 33:49.822
What do you think?

33:51.492 --> 33:53.559
Here. Here's the five
I owe you.

33:53.561 --> 33:56.029
I just want to get some fags.

33:56.530 --> 33:58.631
I've not any money.

34:00.301 --> 34:03.970
A pint of bottle lemonade, Dad, will you?
Of course.

34:03.972 --> 34:05.038
Back in a jiffy.

34:05.040 --> 34:09.542
Dad, did Mum
ever get a gravestone?

34:10.444 --> 34:12.078
Let's take care
of the living first,

34:12.080 --> 34:15.014
and then, you know...

34:18.752 --> 34:21.454
WAITRESS: Would you like
some more water at the table?

34:21.456 --> 34:22.755
Please.

34:32.565 --> 34:34.833
Hey, you can pay at the till.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.969
We close at 6.

34:40.541 --> 34:44.543
Hey, come back here you!

34:45.379 --> 34:47.647
Stop there, will you?

34:50.351 --> 34:52.585
( Bird flutters )

35:28.889 --> 35:30.456
<i>What are you crying for?</i>

35:30.458 --> 35:33.126
<i>I'm the one</i>
<i>who should be bawling.</i>

35:46.173 --> 35:49.509
I said to him, "If you ask me
up to dance one more time",

35:49.511 --> 35:51.010
I'll give you a box
in the nose."

35:51.012 --> 35:52.745
You didn't. I said,

35:52.747 --> 35:55.882
"Did no one never teach you
to take no for an answer?"

35:55.884 --> 35:59.619
Well, he looked to me
like a dodo.

35:59.621 --> 36:00.653
"No."

36:00.655 --> 36:01.721
Ah, the poor fella.

36:01.723 --> 36:02.688
Poor fella me, aye.

36:02.690 --> 36:03.956
He was back 10 minutes later.

36:03.958 --> 36:06.426
"Joan, would you ever
give us a dance

36:06.428 --> 36:07.894
before they stop the music?"

36:07.896 --> 36:08.694
What did you do?

36:08.696 --> 36:10.563
I threw him a punch of course.

36:10.565 --> 36:11.564
You didn't.

36:11.566 --> 36:12.565
I did, he ducked.

36:12.567 --> 36:14.534
Hit his friend,
scruffy little redhead.

36:14.536 --> 36:17.804
I had to dance with him
then to make up for it.

36:17.806 --> 36:18.771
I kissed him and all.

36:18.773 --> 36:21.441
Redheads is good kissers.

36:21.443 --> 36:23.142
More iron in their blood
or something,

36:23.144 --> 36:25.511
but they do taste a bit rusty.

36:25.513 --> 36:28.080
I'll get you one
to have a go-off.

36:50.103 --> 36:52.104
You've done well, girl.

36:53.040 --> 36:53.773
Keep it up now.

36:53.775 --> 36:56.776
Don't let a good beginning
slip away from you,

36:56.778 --> 36:57.710
like so many others.

36:57.712 --> 37:01.714
Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly,
I won't.

37:10.891 --> 37:11.858
( Whistles )

37:11.860 --> 37:15.027
That little redheaded fella
must have been contagious.

37:15.029 --> 37:17.830
He would have given me the flu.

37:18.699 --> 37:21.133
Where'd you live, Shoes?

37:21.135 --> 37:22.835
Me?

37:23.704 --> 37:26.272
Um, down at black pits?

37:26.274 --> 37:29.642
You can walk home with us so.

37:32.646 --> 37:33.680
That's my place.

37:33.682 --> 37:35.382
I'll see yous all tomorrow.

37:35.384 --> 37:39.219
We'll wait,
see you get in safely.

37:39.221 --> 37:40.620
Okay.

37:56.670 --> 37:58.171
Shite, I was wrong.

37:58.173 --> 38:00.306
She's not a tanker. Mm-hmm.

38:00.308 --> 38:01.641
Come on.

38:02.376 --> 38:06.146
♪ Sweet dreams
till sunbeams find you ♪

38:06.148 --> 38:11.751
♪ Sweet dreams that leave
all worries behind you ♪

38:11.753 --> 38:16.556
♪ But in your dreams
whatever they be ♪

38:16.558 --> 38:20.326
♪ Dream a little dream of me ♪

38:20.328 --> 38:22.462
Lovely to meet you.

38:22.464 --> 38:24.264
Goodbye now.

38:34.108 --> 38:34.841
How are you, ladies?

38:34.843 --> 38:37.610
You all right, Christina?
You look very pale.

38:37.612 --> 38:40.280
Pale is the in vogue fashion,
Mr. O'Reilly.

38:40.282 --> 38:43.249
Well, just make sure you're
getting enough to eat now.

38:43.251 --> 38:44.517
Don't be spending
all your wages

38:44.519 --> 38:47.320
in the in vogue fashions,
will you?

39:01.669 --> 39:05.772
Ten more payments and you can
choose your mum's stone.

39:05.774 --> 39:08.508
Then I'm going to carve
her name for free.

39:08.510 --> 39:11.544
Oh, thank you.

39:13.781 --> 39:16.116
( Opera music playing )

39:27.595 --> 39:29.162
Excuse me.

39:41.642 --> 39:46.379
( Opera )

40:02.830 --> 40:04.464
( grunts )

40:07.935 --> 40:09.903
( vehicle approaching )

40:19.780 --> 40:21.581
Can I help you up there, miss?

40:21.583 --> 40:22.815
No, you're all right.

40:22.817 --> 40:24.784
I can get up on my own.

40:26.921 --> 40:28.788
Put your foot into my hands.

40:28.790 --> 40:31.324
I'll hoist up, no bother.

40:37.498 --> 40:39.432
There you go.

40:41.302 --> 40:43.503
Let go of me. I'm over now.

40:43.505 --> 40:46.272
Come on back down here
for a second, young one.

40:46.274 --> 40:47.207
Let go of me I said.

40:47.209 --> 40:49.642
I'd love to look up
what's up your skirt there.

40:49.644 --> 40:51.544
Let go of me I said!

40:51.712 --> 40:53.980
No! No! ( Screams )

40:53.982 --> 40:57.283
We'll just have a bit
of fun, that's all.

40:57.285 --> 40:58.785
Let's get rid of her quick.

40:58.787 --> 41:01.321
( Muffled screams )

41:03.557 --> 41:05.658
Should we toss a coin, lads?

41:05.660 --> 41:08.361
Head or tail, huh?

41:08.929 --> 41:10.663
( Screams )

41:19.607 --> 41:21.674
Grab her legs, that's it.

41:21.676 --> 41:23.676
Leave the girl, will you?

41:24.745 --> 41:26.646
( Muffled screams )

42:08.622 --> 42:12.558
<i>You've let me down very badly.</i>

42:12.560 --> 42:13.893
<i>And I want to know why?</i>

42:13.895 --> 42:17.864
<i>So you better have something</i>
<i>very good in store for me,</i>

42:17.866 --> 42:20.066
<i>to make it up to me,</i>

42:20.068 --> 42:21.901
<i>all right, God?</i>

42:23.671 --> 42:24.804
I do think
you are a good worker.

42:24.806 --> 42:27.907
It's just you can't go missing
for all that time

42:27.909 --> 42:30.576
without so much
as a by your leave,

42:30.578 --> 42:32.312
and expect your job to be here

42:32.314 --> 42:33.079
whenever you pop up again.

42:33.081 --> 42:37.750
That's just not the way
the world works.

42:39.053 --> 42:41.054
Sweet Jesus!

42:53.067 --> 42:56.803
I need to find a way
to help these kids.

42:56.805 --> 42:59.739
<i>Bui doi</i>, the dust of life.

42:59.741 --> 43:01.974
That's what I was once,

43:01.976 --> 43:04.911
just like Tao and Han and Lam

43:04.913 --> 43:07.580
and thousands of other kids.

43:07.582 --> 43:09.549
I can't afford
to make anymore mistakes,

43:09.551 --> 43:12.018
or I'll get
kicked out of this country.

43:12.020 --> 43:15.888
I need you
to tell me what to do.

43:18.559 --> 43:20.059
I'll tell you what.

43:20.061 --> 43:22.962
I'll walk, you lead.

44:03.804 --> 44:04.537
<i>Kahm uhn.</i>

44:04.539 --> 44:07.740
This is private property.
Can I help you?

44:07.742 --> 44:10.777
Sorry, the kite
came over the wall outside.

44:10.779 --> 44:13.112
Thank you for returning it.

44:13.447 --> 44:15.848
( Speaking
in foreign language )

44:16.550 --> 44:17.984
Is this a school?

44:17.986 --> 44:21.554
No, it is
a government orphanage

44:21.556 --> 44:23.089
of Binh Dai district,

44:23.091 --> 44:24.957
private property. Thank you.

44:24.959 --> 44:28.961
Is it ever possible
to visit the children?

44:32.065 --> 44:33.633
Sometimes...

44:33.635 --> 44:36.836
but strictly with permission.

44:36.838 --> 44:38.037
Right,

44:38.039 --> 44:41.474
who do I apply to
for permission?

44:43.944 --> 44:45.545
Me.

44:56.023 --> 44:57.857
( Kid crying )

45:33.060 --> 45:36.195
The evasive agent arrange.

45:37.898 --> 45:39.198
Up here all the children

45:39.200 --> 45:42.702
brought to us
severely malnourished.

45:48.942 --> 45:50.910
( Shouting )

45:59.019 --> 46:02.088
Are you a wealthy woman,
Mrs. Noble?

46:02.090 --> 46:04.924
I wish I could say that I was.

46:04.926 --> 46:08.227
Our history
is full of foreigners

46:08.229 --> 46:10.196
who thought they could help.

46:10.198 --> 46:14.634
Maybe we don't need
anymore disappointment.

46:14.636 --> 46:16.035
I understand that.

46:16.037 --> 46:21.607
What is it that you intend to
do for the sweet children?

46:21.609 --> 46:25.278
I don't know yet exactly.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.647
That is a good start.

46:28.081 --> 46:29.549
When I was much younger

46:29.551 --> 46:32.218
I had a dream
about your country.

46:32.220 --> 46:33.586
I don't know why.

46:33.588 --> 46:35.955
No doctor or psychiatrist
could explain

46:35.957 --> 46:37.623
why I became obsessed
with a country

46:37.625 --> 46:40.092
that I wouldn't have been able
to show them on a map.

46:40.094 --> 46:44.230
Madame Linh,
this may sound mad to you,

46:44.232 --> 46:47.600
but today, right here,

46:47.602 --> 46:49.902
I have my explanation.

46:51.204 --> 46:54.106
Come and see me again tomorrow.

46:56.710 --> 46:57.977
Thank you.

46:57.979 --> 46:59.879
( Drawing curtains )

46:59.881 --> 47:01.881
Good morning, Christina,

47:01.883 --> 47:03.349
or should I say good afternoon?

47:03.351 --> 47:06.018
That was a long sleep you had.

47:10.991 --> 47:12.925
( laughter )

47:14.061 --> 47:16.862
Well, rest, recuperation,

47:16.864 --> 47:19.065
get you back
to the full of your health.

47:19.067 --> 47:20.232
That's what we're about here.

47:20.234 --> 47:22.902
So let's just get you
signed in, will we?

47:22.904 --> 47:25.938
A little bit like a hotel.

47:28.108 --> 47:30.776
Now.

47:30.778 --> 47:33.245
Just here.

47:36.683 --> 47:38.951
What age are you, Sister Laura?

47:38.953 --> 47:40.219
Thirty-one. Why?

47:40.221 --> 47:44.256
Did you always
want to become a nun?

47:44.258 --> 47:46.092
Always.

47:46.094 --> 47:47.326
What about you, Christina?

47:47.328 --> 47:49.128
Did you ever think
about a vocation?

47:49.130 --> 47:51.263
Never.

48:10.250 --> 48:13.419
Sorry I had to bring you
to the nuns, Christina.

48:13.421 --> 48:15.254
It's the only place
that'd take you in.

48:15.256 --> 48:19.825
There was no way they would
let me visit you before now.

48:19.827 --> 48:22.728
"Three months of rest,
no excitements."

48:22.730 --> 48:24.997
I told them I wasn't exciting.

48:24.999 --> 48:28.801
"Come back in 3 months,
not before."

48:28.803 --> 48:31.404
I think
you saved my life, Joan.

48:32.272 --> 48:33.873
This lot are grand,

48:33.875 --> 48:37.143
not like those kind
of lunatics.

48:37.145 --> 48:38.711
I'm forgiven so?

48:38.713 --> 48:40.713
Just about.

48:41.248 --> 48:43.349
I'm going to England, Shoes.

48:43.351 --> 48:45.851
Getting out of this
kip of a place.

48:45.853 --> 48:46.852
Where will you go to?

48:46.854 --> 48:50.923
Birmingham, I've a brother
who lives there.

48:52.125 --> 48:53.459
Would you come with me?

48:53.461 --> 48:55.695
I have no penny to go with.

48:55.697 --> 48:56.429
I'll lend you the money.

48:56.431 --> 48:59.365
You can pay me back
when you get a job.

48:59.367 --> 49:01.333
What do you think?

49:02.335 --> 49:04.437
Will there be any excitements?

49:04.439 --> 49:08.240
There will be, loads.

49:10.277 --> 49:12.178
Sister Laura, please!

49:12.180 --> 49:13.345
Don't be ridiculous, Christina.

49:13.347 --> 49:15.314
What's wrong with me
going to England?

49:15.316 --> 49:16.716
There's nothing for me here.

49:16.718 --> 49:19.852
Would you have some common
sense for God's sake.

49:19.854 --> 49:21.754
What do you mean?

49:21.922 --> 49:25.424
You are going
to have a baby, Christina.

49:27.928 --> 49:28.861
Me?

49:28.863 --> 49:30.062
Yes.

49:30.064 --> 49:32.098
Why else do you think
you're excused

49:32.100 --> 49:33.065
from heavy cleaning work?

49:33.067 --> 49:35.134
And you get second helpings
at dinner

49:35.136 --> 49:37.069
whenever you want them.

49:59.192 --> 50:03.329
He's called Thomas,
after my dad.

50:03.331 --> 50:05.264
Hello, Thomas.

50:05.832 --> 50:08.467
He's gorgeous, Shoes.

50:12.005 --> 50:14.373
So I picked up
the ferry tickets yesterday.

50:14.375 --> 50:15.775
What's your plan for Saturday?

50:15.777 --> 50:17.543
I'll tell them, I'll take him
out in the pram

50:17.545 --> 50:18.944
for a couple of hours.

50:18.946 --> 50:19.879
That's my usual.

50:19.881 --> 50:21.447
Then I'll get the bus
to northwall.

50:21.449 --> 50:23.215
I'll meet you there
at 5 o'clock.

50:23.217 --> 50:25.351
Don't you dare be late now.

50:25.353 --> 50:27.419
I'll go without you.

50:28.188 --> 50:29.822
I will.

50:32.025 --> 50:33.926
( Humming )

50:52.045 --> 50:53.212
Someone's moved Thomas.

50:53.214 --> 50:55.181
Was he taken to the nurse
to be weighed again?

50:55.183 --> 50:56.115
Calm down, Christina.

50:56.117 --> 50:57.449
Tell me where he is,
Sister Laura, please.

50:57.451 --> 51:02.521
Thomas isn't here anymore. It's in
his best interest. Where is he?

51:02.523 --> 51:06.158
You're only 17.
You haven't got a husband.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.459
What's that got
to do with this?

51:07.461 --> 51:10.029
Thomas has gone
to a good Catholic family

51:10.031 --> 51:12.331
where he'll get
the very best of care.

51:12.333 --> 51:13.833
So when do I get to see him?

51:13.835 --> 51:15.901
Well, I'll go and get
my things together.

51:15.903 --> 51:18.604
He's been adopted, Christina.

51:18.606 --> 51:21.373
What?

51:21.375 --> 51:22.274
But you can't do that.

51:22.276 --> 51:26.879
But you signed the papers,
that first day you came here,

51:26.881 --> 51:28.280
do you not remember?

51:28.282 --> 51:29.915
No.

51:30.483 --> 51:35.287
No, oh, my God.

51:36.890 --> 51:38.324
Oh.

51:41.928 --> 51:44.296
I forgive you for that,
Christina.

51:55.308 --> 52:00.112
I don't know what to say
to you except that...

52:00.247 --> 52:04.183
now we both know
what it's like to lose a son.

52:04.185 --> 52:05.885
I'm not being blasphemous.

52:05.887 --> 52:08.587
I'm not comparing
myself to you.

52:08.589 --> 52:11.123
It's just that first I believe,

52:11.125 --> 52:15.561
but now I won't be
able to keep going.

52:17.097 --> 52:18.364
I won't survive.

52:18.366 --> 52:21.600
I hope you're gonna explain
 this to me, very bloody soon.

52:21.602 --> 52:24.470
So until then you're gonna
have to listen to me

52:24.472 --> 52:25.905
swear and curse and shout,

52:25.907 --> 52:29.375
and I won't be asking
for your forgiveness.

52:29.377 --> 52:31.243
Sorry about that.

52:42.155 --> 52:45.958
This is the name
of the government department

52:45.960 --> 52:48.060
you must contact.

52:48.062 --> 52:51.230
It is forbidden
for any foreigner to work

52:51.232 --> 52:54.466
in Vietnam without a red stamp.

52:54.468 --> 52:55.501
Mm-hmm.

52:55.503 --> 53:00.339
Ask for Mr. Ku
and mention my name.

53:00.341 --> 53:02.207
I will, thank you.

53:02.209 --> 53:05.444
And if you want to help
the street children,

53:05.446 --> 53:09.081
you will need
to understand their dangers.

53:09.449 --> 53:12.017
I would like you to meet Trung.

53:12.986 --> 53:15.120
He will show you what I mean.

53:17.090 --> 53:19.992
I've never
had a bodyguard before.

53:19.994 --> 53:22.428
I never been
a bodyguard before.

53:23.063 --> 53:24.964
What do you normally do?

53:24.966 --> 53:26.565
I used to be a duck farmer.

53:26.567 --> 53:27.700
A duck farmer?

53:27.702 --> 53:32.104
Yes, duck is big business
in Vietnam.

53:32.106 --> 53:34.974
Quack-quack, chop-chop.

53:34.976 --> 53:37.242
I feel safer already, Trung.

53:39.112 --> 53:41.480
What's this building used for?

53:43.083 --> 53:44.583
Not used.

54:07.507 --> 54:10.142
( Speaking
in foreign language )

54:33.166 --> 54:35.234
Hello.

54:36.202 --> 54:39.238
It is not usual
to give a work permit

54:39.240 --> 54:41.640
to a foreigner like this.

54:41.642 --> 54:42.808
I do appreciate that,

54:42.810 --> 54:45.377
and I'm grateful
for your consideration.

54:45.379 --> 54:47.379
What will you bring
to Madame Linh?

54:47.381 --> 54:50.315
I will bring hard work,
and passion,

54:50.317 --> 54:53.652
love for the children,
my heart.

54:53.654 --> 54:55.354
Your heart?

54:55.356 --> 54:56.622
And money, I hope.

54:56.624 --> 54:58.824
Oh, yes, and money.

54:58.826 --> 55:01.560
Where will you get
this money from?

55:01.562 --> 55:05.464
You let me worry about that,
Mr. Ku, I have my ways.

55:05.466 --> 55:09.468
Is there anything else
that you would like to say

55:09.470 --> 55:10.702
before we make our decision?

55:10.704 --> 55:13.806
Would you mind
if I sang you a song.

55:13.808 --> 55:15.140
A song?

55:15.142 --> 55:16.775
It's an Irish tradition.

55:16.777 --> 55:20.112
I just give you
the one verse, okay?

55:20.114 --> 55:25.517
♪ Come over the hills,
my handsome Irish lad ♪

55:25.519 --> 55:31.190
♪ Come over the hills
to your darling ♪

55:31.192 --> 55:36.762
♪ You choose the road, love,
and I'll make a vow ♪

55:36.764 --> 55:43.769
♪ That I'll be your true love
forever ♪

55:45.271 --> 55:47.106
Thank you.

55:48.274 --> 55:50.843
( Speaking
in foreign language )

55:52.645 --> 55:56.448
Thank you for your application,
Miss Noble.

55:56.450 --> 55:59.585
We are interested
in what you say

55:59.587 --> 56:01.820
and we like the way
that you say it.

56:01.822 --> 56:04.289
You're very kind.

56:04.291 --> 56:06.391
We will give you a work permit.

56:06.393 --> 56:08.894
Oh, that's brilliant.

56:08.896 --> 56:10.796
For 3 months.

56:10.798 --> 56:13.398
Three months?

56:13.400 --> 56:14.900
That's not very long, Mr. Ku.

56:14.902 --> 56:20.405
Let's see what your heart
can do in 3 months.

56:41.561 --> 56:43.262
I'm checking out.

56:43.264 --> 56:43.896
I can see that.

56:43.898 --> 56:45.330
I'm going to live
with the <i> bui doi.</i>

56:45.332 --> 56:47.432
They offered a better quality
of cockroach

56:47.434 --> 56:48.600
than the Coronet Hotel.

56:48.602 --> 56:51.403
Aha, see, I told
you I'd get a smile

56:51.405 --> 56:53.705
out of you before I left.
No smile.

56:53.707 --> 56:56.475
Oh, yes.
You smile like a little baby.

56:56.477 --> 56:59.411
I'll see you around,
Mr. Reception Desk,

56:59.413 --> 57:01.346
don't forget me now.

57:01.348 --> 57:03.582
I forgot you already.

57:07.453 --> 57:09.655
This way.

57:14.561 --> 57:16.929
Judy say, "Cheap, cheap place."

57:16.931 --> 57:19.565
I need to save
all the money I can, Mia.

57:19.567 --> 57:21.767
People here will
think you are insane.

57:21.769 --> 57:25.804
Yeah, well, a little insane
goes a long way.

57:37.517 --> 57:40.552
It's not far from Madame Linh.

57:59.305 --> 58:00.639
It's perfect.

<i>I'm writing on behalf</i>

Finished?

58:41.315 --> 58:43.282
Yes, 19 letters to deliver.

58:43.284 --> 58:45.751
You're going to have
a busy day tomorrow.

58:45.753 --> 58:47.719
I dream of a busy day.

58:47.920 --> 58:49.054
What else do you dream of, Lam?

58:49.056 --> 58:53.692
I dream of a busy day,
that's all.

59:02.335 --> 59:05.871
I have always wanted
to rebuild this,

59:05.873 --> 59:08.573
but never had the money.

59:09.609 --> 59:11.810
( Thunder rumbling )

59:23.089 --> 59:25.324
( car honking )

59:25.326 --> 59:27.392
Hey.

59:28.027 --> 59:30.929
What the hell are you doing,
you mad woman.

59:30.931 --> 59:33.432
You're trying to get
yourself killed?

59:33.434 --> 59:33.999
Are you Irish?

59:34.001 --> 59:37.369
Amongst many other
fine attributes, yes.

59:37.371 --> 59:38.670
I need to talk to you.

59:38.672 --> 59:39.404
What about?

59:39.406 --> 59:41.573
It'll sound better mixed
with whiskey.

59:41.575 --> 59:42.774
( Giggles )

59:42.776 --> 59:46.478
All right, I'll see you inside.

59:54.554 --> 59:57.556
And I'm not just talking about
the facility that's so so.

59:57.558 --> 01:00:00.025
I'm talking about a place
that you'll be proud of

01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:01.860
if it was in Dublin or London.

01:00:01.862 --> 01:00:04.129
Treating Third World children
the same

01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:05.397
as First World children.

01:00:05.399 --> 01:00:08.900
BlueRock Oil could be
a founding sponsor, Gerry.

01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:12.471
I have to go in.

01:00:12.473 --> 01:00:15.440
And what can I say, Christina,
I'll read your proposal.

01:00:15.442 --> 01:00:17.876
I'll show it to a couple
of colleagues

01:00:17.878 --> 01:00:19.644
and I'll give you a call.

01:00:19.646 --> 01:00:21.646
I bet you say
that to all the girls.

01:00:21.648 --> 01:00:25.751
No, only the crazy ones.

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:51.943
( Speaking
in foreign language )

01:01:09.429 --> 01:01:10.896
Okay, Lam?

01:01:10.898 --> 01:01:17.569
Okay, Mama Tina,
Lam has another dream.

01:01:17.571 --> 01:01:19.204
Do you want to tell me?

01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:25.977
When my father died,
my mother was very lonely.

01:01:25.979 --> 01:01:30.015
No money,
me and two older brothers

01:01:30.017 --> 01:01:33.118
at home, very hungry.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.656
Then Mr. Rat
moved in with my mother.

01:01:37.658 --> 01:01:42.694
He beat us, throw us
out onto the street.

01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:43.829
I miss my mother.

01:01:43.831 --> 01:01:48.533
I dream that one day
I'll see my mother again.

01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:52.070
I have the same dream, Lam.

01:02:05.918 --> 01:02:09.120
I wish you'd come...

01:02:09.122 --> 01:02:10.155
Do you good to get out.

01:02:10.157 --> 01:02:13.058
You've been in here
nearly 2 months now.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.960
Any day, Joanny, I promise.

01:02:14.962 --> 01:02:17.128
There'll be no holding me
back then.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:20.098
Stop your nagging,
is that what you mean?

01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:25.170
I'll try not to wake you.

01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:41.553
Hello. MAN: ( on phone )
<i>Hello, how may I help you?</i>

01:02:41.555 --> 01:02:44.089
I'd like to apply for the job
in the Fish and Chip shop.

<i>experience working chips?</i>

Well, I haven't, no.

I've plenty experience
eating them.

vinegar on those? Yeah.

and a single for you, sir.

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:04.676
Thank you.

01:03:05.846 --> 01:03:07.579
Yes, Mrs. Hennessey,
the usual, is it?

01:03:07.581 --> 01:03:08.880
Well, that'd be lovely.
Underway.

01:03:08.882 --> 01:03:11.783
Another bucket of chips there, Jimmy.
We're good.

01:03:11.785 --> 01:03:15.720
Now who's gonna play for
a hired working girl?

01:03:15.722 --> 01:03:16.555
I will.

Two pickled eggs, she says.

Okay. Music is the way
to a woman's heart,

It's the bright blue sky.

01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:21.921
I've told you before. They're
not bloody well going with you.

01:08:21.924 --> 01:08:24.425
Why not? Because I don't have
a good feeling about this.

01:08:24.426 --> 01:08:26.861
You don't have a good feeling
about my children,

01:08:26.863 --> 01:08:29.196
visiting an 80-year-old aunt
who has traveled all the way

01:08:29.198 --> 01:08:31.599
from Cyprus, who will only
give them sweets and kisses?

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.201
It's not your aunt
I'm worried about.

01:08:34.203 --> 01:08:35.301
What then?

01:08:35.304 --> 01:08:36.502
It's all your showing off,

01:08:36.505 --> 01:08:39.340
and driving at 100 miles an hour
like you always do.

01:08:39.341 --> 01:08:40.908
What do you know
what I always do, huh?

01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:43.577
Shut up talking
for once in your life.

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:46.313
( Car door closing ) Gladly.

01:08:46.314 --> 01:08:50.551

you know that?

01:08:52.354 --> 01:08:54.220

01:08:58.059 --> 01:09:00.661

01:09:00.662 --> 01:09:03.296
Putting spells on people.

01:09:03.299 --> 01:09:05.966
My children
would have been killed

01:09:05.968 --> 01:09:08.234
or maimed if they'd
been in that car.

01:09:08.237 --> 01:09:11.104
I'm gonna do something
about you.

01:09:11.107 --> 01:09:13.140
Yeah?

01:09:13.142 --> 01:09:16.343
I'm gonna do something
about you too.

01:09:27.421 --> 01:09:28.988
Do you know who I am?

01:09:28.991 --> 01:09:31.325
I know what you are.

01:09:31.327 --> 01:09:33.394
What am I?

01:09:33.395 --> 01:09:36.029
A fish wife.

01:09:41.236 --> 01:09:43.370
Get your own husband.

01:09:49.344 --> 01:09:52.379
He'll come after me, Joan.

01:09:52.381 --> 01:09:53.247
He always does.

01:09:53.249 --> 01:09:55.349
This can't go on, Shoes.

01:09:55.351 --> 01:09:58.052
You're lucky you
didn't lose an eye.

01:09:58.186 --> 01:10:00.287
What'll he do the next time?

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.642
I need to know
that you're still there.

01:10:57.178 --> 01:11:00.014
Have you forgotten me
completely?

01:13:04.472 --> 01:13:06.206
CHRISTINA: <i> I don't think</i>

01:13:18.521 --> 01:13:23.357
<i>I will go to Vietnam,</i>
<i>I swear to Almighty you,</i>

01:13:23.359 --> 01:13:26.627

Well, they're rubbish.

01:13:39.742 --> 01:13:42.176
Thanks for keeping
them for me, Fan.

01:13:42.178 --> 01:13:43.343
No good news?

01:13:43.345 --> 01:13:43.844
No, not today.

01:13:43.846 --> 01:13:46.713
Maybe it's not your destiny.
What isn't?

01:13:46.715 --> 01:13:49.650
Looking after these <i> bui doi,</i>
maybe you can't do it.

01:13:49.652 --> 01:13:51.718
There's no such thing as can't.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.353
You tell him, Christina.

01:13:53.355 --> 01:13:54.655
You get me this number in Hanoi

01:13:54.657 --> 01:13:56.857
and I'll take it in
booth three.

01:13:56.859 --> 01:13:57.925
Okay.

01:13:57.927 --> 01:13:59.660
Who's this little man?

01:13:59.662 --> 01:14:00.460
This is Lam.

01:14:00.462 --> 01:14:01.662
He's my new business partner.

01:14:01.664 --> 01:14:03.964
We're waiting for everything
to go whoosh.

01:14:03.966 --> 01:14:05.933
Very funny. Hello, Lam.

01:14:05.935 --> 01:14:08.368
He's got look of a young
Jimmy Cagney about him...

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:09.236
( telephone rings )

01:14:09.238 --> 01:14:10.737
Something in the eyes I think.

01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:12.306
Your call.

01:14:12.308 --> 01:14:12.773
Great.

01:14:12.775 --> 01:14:15.909
Don't let her
work you too hard.

01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:17.878

( baby crying )

01:14:36.231 --> 01:14:40.734
Just having a child
is difficult for poor people

01:14:40.736 --> 01:14:43.570
in Ho Chi Minh City.

01:14:43.572 --> 01:14:46.607
If there is a birth defect,

01:14:46.609 --> 01:14:50.510
they think they are being
punished by fate

01:14:50.512 --> 01:14:53.280
and they abandon the child.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:54.881
Abandon where?

01:14:54.883 --> 01:14:58.018
In this place, in the garbage.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:03.624
We always give babies a name
when they arrive.

01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:08.862
We call her Mai,
it means cherry blossom.

01:15:08.864 --> 01:15:10.697
Will Mai live?

01:15:10.699 --> 01:15:14.668
The infection
on her head is bad.

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.036

You'd be surprised
how many parties

01:17:40.649 --> 01:17:42.082
there are in the oil business.

01:17:42.084 --> 01:17:43.884
Why is that do you think?

01:17:43.886 --> 01:17:48.121
Because we are
very good at digging.

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:49.956
Years of practice.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:51.458
I always thought
people drill for oil.

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.994
Well, that's exactly
where they've been going wrong.

01:17:53.996 --> 01:17:55.862
Digging is the new drilling.

01:17:55.864 --> 01:17:56.496
Is it?

01:17:56.498 --> 01:17:58.698
It is,
and that is our company motto

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.102
and that is why we are
top of the heap.

01:18:04.539 --> 01:18:07.007
And what do you see
when you look down, Gerry?

01:18:07.009 --> 01:18:09.443
Ah, you don't look down,
Christina.

01:18:09.445 --> 01:18:10.977
Isn't that what they tell you?

01:18:10.979 --> 01:18:13.914
Because you might get
vertigo and fall.

01:18:13.916 --> 01:18:15.115
That's right.

asking if anyone know who you are.

It doesn't matter who I am. There's a
dangerous man up there with a child.

What do you want?

about the fact

that your hotel
is being used by foreigners

01:21:33.915 --> 01:21:34.381

This is a good place,

01:21:37.719 --> 01:21:39.686
take a child up
in the elevator.

you get him down here

and break the door in.

or he'll call the police.

01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:51.898
Yes, call the police, that's
exactly what you should do.

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.334
I ask you
for the last time to get out.

01:21:54.336 --> 01:21:56.970
I don't know you,
why are you causing trouble?

01:21:56.972 --> 01:21:58.805
Listen to me, I have
been given permission

01:21:58.807 --> 01:22:00.740
by the government to look
after these children,

01:22:00.742 --> 01:22:03.677
to stop them
from being raped in your hotel.

01:22:03.679 --> 01:22:04.778
Now you get that man down here

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:07.881
or I will call
Inspector Bong myself.

01:22:13.821 --> 01:22:16.322
Would you do this to a 10-year-old
girl in your own country?

01:22:16.324 --> 01:22:18.725
I should've known
you're just a frustrated

01:22:18.727 --> 01:22:20.126
old cad the
first time I met you.

01:22:20.128 --> 01:22:21.261
Just because
she's a street child

01:22:21.263 --> 01:22:23.163
you think you can do
what you like to her?

01:22:23.165 --> 01:22:24.964
Mind your own business.

01:22:24.966 --> 01:22:27.300
( Indistinct chatter )

01:22:27.435 --> 01:22:29.402
If I see you
with a child again,

01:22:29.404 --> 01:22:30.904
I'll splash your ugly face

01:22:30.906 --> 01:22:33.907
across every newspaper
in Southeast Asia.

01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:36.009
I will get you, bitch!

01:22:36.011 --> 01:22:37.143
Oh, you don't frighten me.

01:22:37.145 --> 01:22:40.346
I am not a child
that you can frighten.

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:56.730
Look, those kids up there
are the lucky ones.

01:22:56.732 --> 01:22:58.832
They've got a roof
over their heads.

01:22:58.834 --> 01:23:00.300
What if you're a child
living on the streets?

01:23:00.302 --> 01:23:06.206
You're 12 years old and you're looking
after your little sister, she is 6.

01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:09.008
Forget about education
or healthcare,

01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:11.311
forget about protection
from danger

01:23:11.313 --> 01:23:15.782
or a little bit of love
and a cuddle, forget that.

01:23:15.784 --> 01:23:18.184
And now count yourselves
in the thousands,

01:23:18.186 --> 01:23:21.755
living out there in every
derelict building in this city.

01:23:21.757 --> 01:23:25.024
Just like this one here,
except this one is going to be

01:23:25.026 --> 01:23:29.996
rebuilt so that you can come
and visit for basic hygiene,

01:23:29.998 --> 01:23:31.931
for medicine, for school,

01:23:31.933 --> 01:23:34.801
and to be treated
like a kid again.

01:23:34.803 --> 01:23:35.935
Because that's the very least

01:23:35.937 --> 01:23:38.772
that you
and your little sister deserve.

01:23:45.946 --> 01:23:50.917
GERRY: So it'll go before
the committee up at head office.

01:23:50.919 --> 01:23:52.352
Now unfortunately, Christina,

01:23:52.354 --> 01:23:56.356
there's a couple of today's
delegates that feel it's...

01:23:56.358 --> 01:23:57.524
Feel what?

01:23:57.526 --> 01:23:59.025
That it's just a drop
in the ocean

01:23:59.027 --> 01:24:02.428
in the context of the overall
need in Ho Chi Minh City.

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:04.864
Now therefore disinclined
to recommend.

01:24:04.866 --> 01:24:06.833
But this is only the beginning.

01:24:06.835 --> 01:24:07.901
This is just the blueprint.

01:24:07.903 --> 01:24:09.903
If we build one center,
we can build ten.

01:24:09.905 --> 01:24:12.305
I'm sorry
not to be more positive.

01:24:12.307 --> 01:24:13.439
Fight for me, Gerry.

01:24:13.441 --> 01:24:15.141
You can bring them around,
I know you can.

01:24:15.143 --> 01:24:21.481
Christina, you don't want
to work for me, do you?

01:24:21.483 --> 01:24:25.985
No, I want you to come
and work for me.

01:25:56.076 --> 01:25:59.212
( Speaking
in foreign language )

01:26:13.193 --> 01:26:14.193
CHRISTINA: Is that Carol?

01:26:14.195 --> 01:26:15.295
CAROL: ( on phone )<i> Speaking.</i>

01:26:15.297 --> 01:26:16.429
It's Christina Noble.

01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:17.697
CAROL: ( on phone )
( indistinct )

01:26:17.699 --> 01:26:20.166
Yeah, I know that
but if you could just be sure

01:26:20.168 --> 01:26:21.434
to tell Gerry
that I called again.

01:26:21.436 --> 01:26:22.669
CAROL: ( on phone )
<i>I will, yes.</i>

01:26:22.671 --> 01:26:26.306
Yeah, and to make the point that it's
been 2 weeks since the delegation visited

01:26:26.308 --> 01:26:28.341
and I was promised a decision
within 10 days.

01:26:28.343 --> 01:26:29.676
CAROL: ( on phone )
<i>I will tell him.</i>

01:26:29.678 --> 01:26:33.613
I'm sorry to be pushy, Carol, but my
government parameter is running out fast.

01:26:33.615 --> 01:26:36.049
CAROL: ( on phone )
<i>I will tell him.</i>

01:27:04.078 --> 01:27:05.712
It'll be okay, Lam.

01:27:19.493 --> 01:27:21.761
( Footsteps approaching )

01:27:27.301 --> 01:27:28.701
Mr. Rat has gone.

01:27:28.703 --> 01:27:31.371
Lam can stay with his mother.

01:27:31.373 --> 01:27:33.639
That's great, Lam.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.777
You come and see me
sometime, okay?

01:27:56.663 --> 01:27:58.364
( Gasps )

01:28:02.336 --> 01:28:04.170
Oh, God.

01:28:09.309 --> 01:28:12.311
Mrs. Noble,
we are on the same side.

01:28:12.313 --> 01:28:15.415
I hate this people
as much as you do,

01:28:15.417 --> 01:28:17.650
but I need evidence.

01:28:17.652 --> 01:28:18.651
Here. Here's evidence.

01:28:18.653 --> 01:28:21.254
There's a photo of him
on this roll of film.

01:28:21.256 --> 01:28:23.489
I took it the night
that I followed him.

01:28:23.491 --> 01:28:26.492
Illegally? Justifiably.

01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:31.097
So what is the photograph of?

01:28:31.099 --> 01:28:33.332
Him, David Summers.

01:28:36.804 --> 01:28:40.673
Is there a child
with him in the photograph?

01:28:41.742 --> 01:28:44.110
( Sighs )

01:28:44.112 --> 01:28:45.478
No.

01:28:57.624 --> 01:29:00.626
I need you to do
something for me, Fan.

01:29:00.628 --> 01:29:03.596
You're not going to like it.

01:29:03.598 --> 01:29:05.398
Tell me something new.

01:29:58.152 --> 01:30:02.755
Don't worry, Mama Tina,
I look after them for you.

01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:04.157
I know you will.

01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:07.260
And don't be offering
them cigarettes, all right?

01:30:07.262 --> 01:30:08.427
I promise.

01:30:08.429 --> 01:30:09.829
You promise to come back.

01:30:09.831 --> 01:30:11.797
On my mother's grave.

01:30:11.799 --> 01:30:13.666
And don't bring any husband.

01:30:13.668 --> 01:30:16.269
I would be jealous.

01:30:16.271 --> 01:30:18.571
No husband, I promise.

01:30:18.573 --> 01:30:20.506
It's fucked up.

01:30:32.219 --> 01:30:33.686
Ready?

01:30:39.426 --> 01:30:40.793
( Sighs )

01:30:49.403 --> 01:30:52.972
I may have to be in London
for a few months, Madame Linh.

01:30:52.974 --> 01:30:55.241
I know I'll have to apply
for another permit.

01:30:55.243 --> 01:30:58.644
I'll...
just have to take my chances.

01:30:58.646 --> 01:31:00.646
And I'm sorry
about the typewriter,

01:31:00.648 --> 01:31:01.547
I will replace it.

01:31:01.549 --> 01:31:05.418
I don't think they will
give you another permit.

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:11.557
The time has passed
and we achieved very little.

01:31:11.559 --> 01:31:12.258
( Sighs )

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.359
TRUNG: Excuse me, Christina.

01:31:13.361 --> 01:31:15.962
Your car is here
to take you the airport.

01:31:15.964 --> 01:31:18.331
What car?

01:31:18.333 --> 01:31:21.367
I didn't order a car.

01:31:37.983 --> 01:31:39.283
Jump in and close
 the door, will you?

01:31:39.285 --> 01:31:43.154
The air conditioning is doing
overtime in this bloody heat.

01:31:43.156 --> 01:31:45.223
( Sighs )

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.461
Hello, Christina. Gerry.

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:53.431
I hear you're on your way back
to the London.

01:31:53.433 --> 01:31:54.365
You hear right.

01:31:54.367 --> 01:31:57.268
That's a pity.

01:31:57.270 --> 01:32:00.271
That's also a pity that
I've been turned down by

01:32:00.273 --> 01:32:02.774
every oil company in this city.

01:32:02.776 --> 01:32:05.276
Germans, Mexicans, Taiwanese,

01:32:05.278 --> 01:32:08.546
and I've been calling
your office for 2 weeks

01:32:08.548 --> 01:32:09.947
without getting a reply.

01:32:09.949 --> 01:32:11.315
I'm sorry, I've been very busy.

01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:13.351
Yeah, that's what they all say.

01:32:13.353 --> 01:32:18.222
I wouldn't go to the airport
right now if I were you.

01:32:18.224 --> 01:32:19.190
Why not?

01:32:19.192 --> 01:32:20.825
Because our committee
has taken a liking

01:32:20.827 --> 01:32:25.930
to your proposal for a
social and medical center.

01:32:28.066 --> 01:32:30.535
Don't...

01:32:30.537 --> 01:32:33.538
Don't mess with me, Gerry.

01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:37.341
Twenty thousand dollars
of our liking.

01:32:42.181 --> 01:32:43.548
Are you joking me?

01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:45.550
No.

01:32:45.552 --> 01:32:47.919
Oh, my God.

01:32:48.453 --> 01:32:50.154
Congratulations.

01:32:55.093 --> 01:32:56.460
I won't let you down.

01:32:56.462 --> 01:32:57.862
I know.

01:32:57.864 --> 01:33:00.131
That is amazing.

01:33:03.035 --> 01:33:04.168
Thank you.

01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:06.037
Thank you.

01:33:18.417 --> 01:33:19.617
( Speaking
in foreign language )

01:33:19.619 --> 01:33:21.018
What the hell are you doing?

01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.955
( Speaking
in foreign language )

01:33:25.424 --> 01:33:26.991
Leave me.

01:33:27.359 --> 01:33:29.594
No. Don't, no.

01:33:43.075 --> 01:33:47.645
Mrs. Noble, you have
already met your destiny.

01:33:47.647 --> 01:33:49.447
You have nothing left to prove.

01:33:49.449 --> 01:33:51.282
You know me a little,
not a lot.

01:33:51.284 --> 01:33:52.416
I have everything
left to prove.

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:56.053
You must have a stronger focus
if you are to win the battle.

01:33:56.055 --> 01:33:58.456
You forget that
they call us the fighting Irish.

01:33:58.458 --> 01:34:02.660
We, Vietnamese, have faced
more powerful enemies than you.

01:34:02.662 --> 01:34:06.530
Not all, you've never taken
on the nuns, twice.

01:34:06.532 --> 01:34:07.899
We are ready for them.

01:34:07.901 --> 01:34:09.066
That's what you think.

01:34:09.068 --> 01:34:11.669
And are you ready, Mrs. Noble?

01:34:11.671 --> 01:34:14.105
I am, Madame Linh.

01:34:14.573 --> 01:34:18.976
Ready, steady, go.

01:34:28.954 --> 01:34:30.521
( laughs )

01:34:32.491 --> 01:34:35.359
