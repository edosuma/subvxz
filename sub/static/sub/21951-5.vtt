 NAM IS READY TO WIN HIS FIGHT.

 EVERYTHING HE THROWS IS POWER.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.140
      IT'S THE FIGHT GAME.      

17:22.207 --> 17:25.710

          [ LAUGHTER ]          

17:27.378 --> 17:29.313
          Chivitchian:          
    IT WAS A LOT MOTIVATIONAL   

17:29.381 --> 17:31.349
      SEEING CHUCK LIDDELL      
      AND TALKING TO HIM,       

17:31.417 --> 17:33.618
AND I THINK THE YELLOW TEAM     
    NEEDED THIS BOOST,          

17:33.685 --> 17:36.220
     AND CHUCK WAS SOMEBODY     
    THAT WE COULD RELATE TO.

 THIS, IT'S NOT THE JOB FOR YOU.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE FIGHTING,     
IF YOU DON'T LIKE TRAINING,     

17:57.776 --> 17:59.410

OF A LOT BETTER THAN A REAL JOB,
