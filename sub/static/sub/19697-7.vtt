00:21.000 --> 00:23.360
APPLAUSE

00:24.920 --> 00:28.080
Hello! Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.600
It's the last episode of the series.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.840
But don't worry,

00:31.840 --> 00:34.480
because we are really pushing the boat out for this one.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.920
Literally. We made a boat and we pushed it out.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.960
Into the sea. Really!

00:39.960 --> 00:41.640
But that's a little later in the show.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.920
First, a question -

00:42.920 --> 00:47.480
£50,000, a two-seat sports car - what do you go for?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.800
Tell 'em, Chris.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.840
Well, unless you were completely mad, traditionally, you'd always

00:51.840 --> 00:53.040
have gone for this -

00:53.040 --> 00:55.680
the Porsche Cayman, the model sports car.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.880
Pretty much un-improvable.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.080
But now there's a new Cayman,

01:00.080 --> 01:03.160
and Porsche says it's even better than before.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.360
Here it is.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.680
It still looks like a Cayman,

01:15.680 --> 01:18.720
but one that's been drawn with sharper pencils.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.240
It still has the engine in the middle...

01:23.800 --> 01:25.040
..power at the rear...

01:25.040 --> 01:27.520
and it still costs about £50,000.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.360
It's the same story inside, where, thankfully,

01:35.360 --> 01:39.080
Porsche hasn't messed with all the things we liked about the old car.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.400
I've still got three pedals, and this lovely,

01:44.400 --> 01:47.160
wiggly, wand-like thing to change gear.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.360
But if you delve deeper...

01:49.360 --> 01:52.720
you'll find a million teeny-tiny upgrades.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.160
For starters, the Cayman's big brother - the 911 -

01:59.160 --> 02:01.640
has given up its steering and brakes.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.680
The lower rear suspension arms are from the last generation Cayman GT4.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.040
The anti-roll bars are larger diameter all around.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.160
The front springs are now variable rate.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.640
The rear tyres, well, they are 12mm wider.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.440
Much of which is not interesting.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.480
What is interesting is more horsepower.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.720
The Cayman S now has 345 of them.

02:31.840 --> 02:35.760
This car will do 0-60mph in a sneeze over four seconds.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.920
And it won't stop accelerating until you hit 177mph.

02:43.880 --> 02:44.920
Braking!

02:53.320 --> 02:56.800
And that extra horsepower also means something else.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.880
If there was a fault with the old Cayman,

02:58.880 --> 03:02.720
it's that it didn't have quite enough power to explore the limits

03:02.720 --> 03:04.840
of that lovely, mid-engine chassis.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.240
This new one, however...

03:10.960 --> 03:12.000
Oh, yes!

03:21.480 --> 03:22.840
Yes, yes, yes!

03:30.560 --> 03:32.400
I could do that all day long.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.720
The trouble is, I'm not enjoying this as much as I should do.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.360
Allow me to explain.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.680
That there is the old Cayman S.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.160
Six cylinder, normally aspirated engine, and it sounds like...

03:52.160 --> 03:54.560
Well, judge for yourself.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.760
ENGINE ROARS

04:02.040 --> 04:05.520
That is engine sound perfection.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.240
If you asked Daft Punk to create intake noise, it'd sound like that.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.280
But for this new Cayman, Porsche ditched the lovely old

04:15.280 --> 04:18.680
six-cylinder engine for a new, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.320
And it sounds like...

04:20.320 --> 04:23.160
SUBDUED ROAR

04:23.160 --> 04:24.200
..an old Beetle.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.760
This is a big deal.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.080
Because, I'm sorry,

04:30.080 --> 04:34.040
but the way a sports car sounds is a huge part of its personality.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.800
It's the same as humans. Voices matter.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.080
I mean, take, say, Rod Stewart and put him on mute,

04:40.080 --> 04:43.120
and he's just a Scottish bloke with ladies' hair.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.000
And the reason for this vocal transplant?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.360
The Cayman needed a smaller turbo engine

04:50.360 --> 04:52.200
to pass the latest emissions exams.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.960
Yep.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.880
Forget sound and soul. These days, apparently what's important

04:58.880 --> 05:05.000
is that this car will officially emit 184g of CO2 per kilometre.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.800
But let me show you how you must drive to achieve those 184 CO2s

05:09.800 --> 05:13.200
using this rather elegant piece of equipment behind me

05:13.200 --> 05:15.480
and some very clever men over there.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.520
Here we go.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.040
- OVER RADIO:
- 'Right, so, Chris, to get the best mpg, lowest CO2,

05:21.040 --> 05:22.400
'build up the speed gently.'

05:24.480 --> 05:26.160
'Lovely, lovely and sedate.'

05:27.480 --> 05:29.440
No, no, no.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.040
'Don't overdo it, that's probably a little too fast.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.320
'You can back it off slightly more, I'd say.'

05:36.640 --> 05:39.320
BIKE BELL RINGS

05:39.320 --> 05:40.640
Boring.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.680
Boring, boring.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.280
CO2, boring.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.800
After a few more tedious minutes,

05:48.800 --> 05:51.680
I pulled over to find out my exam results.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.840
OK, boss, how was that?

05:52.840 --> 05:56.960
That was 184g per kilometre of CO2.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.080
About 35 miles per gallon.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.480
OK. The reality is that, in the real world,

06:06.480 --> 06:09.920
if you drive like a normal person with feet,

06:09.920 --> 06:14.000
no car comes close to matching its official emissions figures.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.440
And turbo engines are the worst offenders.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.600
In fact, in the hands of any of us lot,

06:20.600 --> 06:24.080
I doubt this engine's any more efficient than the one it replaced.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.440
It is a real shame.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.520
The old Cayman wasn't broken,

06:30.520 --> 06:33.480
but Porsche has been forced to fix it anyway.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.480
Now we've got this different personality.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.520
And I have to say, I just don't like it as much as it was before.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.200
So the big question now is, if you're after

06:43.200 --> 06:47.600
a two-seat sports car for about 50 grand, what's the alternative?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.000
The Alpha 4C.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.280
Look at that.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.600
Carbon fibre tub, Italian styling.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.640
Build quality of a Glastonbury tent.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.840
Go away.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.680
Ah, the Jaguar F-Type.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.000
But, of course, you want the supercharged V8 one,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.520
and that's 90 grand, so, I'm afraid, disqualified.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.080
The Lotus Exige.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.760
Perfect, should you happen to live at a racing circuit.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.280
Which, of course, you don't.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.720
Ooh, the Audi TT RS.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.320
400 horsepower, five-cylinder turbo-charged engine.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.080
And lashings of understeer.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.720
And that really is your lot.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.760
Which leaves us, well, pretty much back where we started.

07:31.400 --> 07:36.560
If you've got 50 grand to spend on a new sports car, you should buy...

07:36.560 --> 07:38.160
a new Cayman.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.840
Even a mildly ruined Cayman is still better than the rest.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.960
You might want a pair of these though.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.120
HE MOUTHS

07:56.760 --> 07:58.880
APPLAUSE

07:58.880 --> 08:00.200
Great, nice job.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.120
Nice job. OK, so...

08:04.760 --> 08:09.240
So, they made it more powerful, they made faster,

08:09.240 --> 08:13.160
they made it cheaper to tax, all for the same price, and you

08:13.160 --> 08:16.920
don't like it because it doesn't sound quite as good as the old car?

08:16.920 --> 08:21.080
Do think that maybe, just maybe, you're being...

08:21.080 --> 08:23.000
slightly oversensitive?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.520
- I'm really not. Sound is so important.
- Mm-hm.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.440
This car, six-cylinder engine, it's just musical,

08:29.440 --> 08:33.280
it's the heart of the car. And the intake noise - fantastic.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.000
This new version, turbocharger, no intake noise, four cylinders -

08:37.000 --> 08:38.799
it sounds...

08:38.799 --> 08:41.080
- parpy.
- LAUGHTER

08:41.080 --> 08:42.679
Oh.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.480
Nice.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.000
You don't get a lot of parpy these days.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.160
OK, one more thing.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.680
I noticed in the film that you called this the Porsche Cayman.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.840
Yeah.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.400
But it isn't, is it?

08:55.400 --> 08:58.800
This is the Porsche 718 Cayman.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.480
I refuse to acknowledge that badge.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.880
What?

09:01.880 --> 09:03.600
You can't refuse to acknowledge it.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.480
It's right there on the back of the car.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.880
And it's pedigree - the 718 was a Porsche racer from the '50s, right?

09:09.880 --> 09:13.080
This is Porsche exploiting its wonderful motorsport history

09:13.080 --> 09:16.360
for the sake of a badge on a modern car. It's terrible!

09:16.360 --> 09:17.600
Are you done?

09:17.600 --> 09:20.040
- No, we can...
- Can you try to be done?

09:20.040 --> 09:22.440
- Look...
- Let's pretend you're done. OK.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.440
It's time to find out how quick the new 718 goes around our test track.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.880
And you know what that means. It's time for...

09:28.880 --> 09:30.680
The Stig.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.320
Off the line.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.960
Looks like a Porsche, sounds like a,

09:34.960 --> 09:36.880
well, it sounds like a Subaru, doesn't it?

09:36.880 --> 09:39.240
Down there to the first corner. Let's have a look at this,

09:39.240 --> 09:41.640
cos the chassis is great, the Cayman's so well-balanced.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.840
He carries great speed in, very little understeer,

09:43.840 --> 09:45.520
using all the track as usual.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.240
And the braking stability into Chicago, just fantastic.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.800
And he'll hold a tight line, will he?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.360
He let it run out a bit, but again

09:52.360 --> 09:54.440
you can tell he's got power to play with.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.720
345 horsepower.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.440
The amazing thing is, it's a smaller-capacity engine -

09:58.440 --> 10:02.840
the turbocharger has 37 foot-pounds of torque more than the old Cayman.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.360
So it's now a monster.

10:04.360 --> 10:09.600
Braking well again. Doesn't it look stable? It's flat, crisp.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.360
A tight line. Let it run out now.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.320
Look at that - just controlled, relaxed.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.040
Heading now down towards the follow-through.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.400
It's really fast. Again, competent.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.120
And doesn't it sound absolutely terrible?

10:22.120 --> 10:23.760
Can you hear it?

10:23.760 --> 10:25.280
Braking into second to last.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.600
Now, heading - ooh, using all the track there, aggressive -

10:33.600 --> 10:36.880
over Gambon, and a very impressive, terrible-sounding lap.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.040
APPLAUSE

10:43.440 --> 10:45.080
OK.

10:45.080 --> 10:49.800
And the Porsche 718 Cayman S went around

10:49.800 --> 10:52.360
in 1:21.6.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.000
That is seriously respectable.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.200
That's the exact same time as the Jaguar V8 F-Type.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.040
APPLAUSE

11:03.040 --> 11:06.880
And the Jaguar V8 F-Type costs nearly twice as much.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.000
- Yeah, and it sounds twice as good too...
- Look, you're done.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.320
Rory!

11:11.320 --> 11:12.760
I'm just going to say it -

11:12.760 --> 11:15.840
you know what other sports car you can have for £50,000?

11:15.840 --> 11:18.160
Ford Mustang, the one with the V8.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.760
- Can't argue with the way that sounds.
- No, you can't, no.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.840
All right, now it's time to welcome this week's guest.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.960
He's got a lot of platinum discs,

11:25.960 --> 11:29.120
he's got a lot of cars and he's got a lot of...hats.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.320
Please welcome Jay Kay.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.280
APPLAUSE

11:43.280 --> 11:44.800
I'm so pleased!

11:45.920 --> 11:47.760
Thank you.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.720
All right, awesome.

11:49.720 --> 11:50.760
Awesome.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.360
So what did you drive down in today?

11:53.360 --> 11:54.960
I flew in, actually.

11:54.960 --> 11:59.640
I flew in. I avoided the traffic, so I flew in a R66.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.840
- Helicopter?
- Yep. Get over the M25, easy.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.600
20 minutes. Job done.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.320
You're like a rock star. I love it!

12:07.320 --> 12:08.560
That's what they say.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.040
LAUGHTER

12:10.040 --> 12:13.360
- How many cars in your collection nowadays?
- Erm, well,

12:13.360 --> 12:15.240
I'm sort of trying to slim it down.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.720
I mean, it's too many, really.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.080
- But it's over 50.
- AUDIENCE GASPS

12:19.080 --> 12:20.680
But the amazing thing is,

12:20.680 --> 12:24.360
people know that Jay's got some top-end stuff. Enzo and other stuff.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.880
But what I love is that you have the same affliction as me.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.080
You can't help but love German tat.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.320
Yeah, there's just some old M3s, E30s. There's an old Rover P6.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.680
- MAN IN AUDIENCE:
- Wahey!

12:36.680 --> 12:39.760
It's got... I heard a wahey there. Look at that.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.040
See, Rover P6, 13,000 miles.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.520
I just love old things that, you know, when you were a kid,

12:45.520 --> 12:49.000
you used to see on the road, you know... How can you go wrong?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.720
- We know you love your exotic, Italian stuff.
- Yeah.

12:51.720 --> 12:52.920
You're a fan of those.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.920
And your current car that you drive the most is Italian.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.440
But it's not exactly exotic, is it?

12:58.440 --> 12:59.920
Yeah, I have a Fiat Doblo as well.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.280
- A Doblo.
- Yeah.
- We've got a picture of it.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.560
LAUGHTER

13:03.560 --> 13:05.800
That is it. That's my Doblo.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.880
Just a quick question, you could have bought a Bentley Bentayga,

13:08.880 --> 13:11.480
- a Range Rover...
- Well...
- ..and you've gone for a Doblo.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.480
You wouldn't catch me dead in a Bentley Bentayga.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.120
Yeah, but the Doblo is reliable, it always starts.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.600
It's light clutch, light gearbox.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.320
It's light steering, you can get stuff in it.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.320
You can get wood in it, you can get the dog in it.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.440
It's great and it works.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.280
And you know what the funny thing is?

13:28.280 --> 13:31.360
You go to Italy and you go up the mountains in Italy, you know,

13:31.360 --> 13:35.160
up the northern mountains, you'll still see Panda 4x4s.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.000
I could never work out what was the point of a Panda 4x4,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.560
and then you suddenly realise, you're up there in the winter,

13:40.560 --> 13:43.240
and that is the only thing that will go up those Alpine passes.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.640
- True, true.
- With goats in the back, you know?

13:45.640 --> 13:48.200
I want to veer off of cars for just a second.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.800
- Because you have a new album out, Automaton.
- Yeah.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.960
- How it's it doing?
- Well, I hear, down the grapevine,

13:53.960 --> 13:57.800
that it's at number one worldwide, actually.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.240
Aha, that's what I hear!

13:59.240 --> 14:00.840
APPLAUSE

14:03.520 --> 14:06.560
Which isn't bad for an old mucker like me, you know?

14:06.560 --> 14:08.880
Now, normally we wouldn't play a music video,

14:08.880 --> 14:11.680
but we wanted everyone to see the new single, Cloud 9.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.880
Let's take a look.

14:15.240 --> 14:21.120
# Only a fool could walk away from me this time

14:23.160 --> 14:29.440
# I look up to heaven and the starry sea is mine

14:31.800 --> 14:37.640
# Only a fool could walk away from me this time

14:40.080 --> 14:45.520
# I'm walking on air and every cloud is cloud nine... #

14:50.200 --> 14:52.160
APPLAUSE

14:52.160 --> 14:54.080
Right, right, right - wait there.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.920
Oh, dear.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.240
There is a template here, isn't there?

14:59.240 --> 15:01.200
There's a template for the Jamiroquai video...

15:01.200 --> 15:03.600
People of my generation. So, basically, there's two,

15:03.600 --> 15:06.520
at least two, super-sexy cars.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.680
There's an attractive lady

15:09.680 --> 15:12.040
and then there's bit of jigging goes on. Is that...?

15:12.040 --> 15:15.120
Yeah, I tell you what, because we thought about this,

15:15.120 --> 15:18.200
and we thought, you know, everybody said, "Oh, cars, video..."

15:18.200 --> 15:22.520
I mean, and then we thought, well, Cosmic Girl was 1997,

15:22.520 --> 15:25.320
so it's 20 years ago, you know?

15:25.320 --> 15:27.880
But it was quite nice, because we went back to Cabo de Gata,

15:27.880 --> 15:30.440
where we'd filmed the original. So that was the kind of thing.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.560
So people who'd seen the first one, to go back there...

15:33.560 --> 15:35.760
You talked about Cosmic Girl,

15:35.760 --> 15:39.160
and that was a benchmark video, I think, for a generation.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.640
Because it showed super-sexy cars, dynamic driving...

15:42.640 --> 15:44.040
Look at this.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.400
There is a story behind that.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.280
It wasn't quite as straightforward...

15:47.280 --> 15:49.200
No, it wasn't.

15:49.200 --> 15:55.040
They made three of those special edition 30th-anniversary Diablos.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.520
And one was a Jota, so it was a 600-brake car

15:57.520 --> 16:00.640
that was not really road legal, so there were only two.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.360
So I had mine in storage,

16:02.360 --> 16:06.320
and the guy went to stick it on the car transporter.

16:06.320 --> 16:10.040
And then I got word that he'd just totalled this car.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.880
- AUDIENCE GROANS
- There it is.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.000
And we kind of had to have a purple one, because it was the purple,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.040
- the cosmic, you know, it's just one of those things.
- Sure, yeah.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.240
So we got the other one.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.160
And I said, "Look, wait till I get there, I'm flying in,

16:22.160 --> 16:24.640
"just nobody drive it till I get there, please?

16:24.640 --> 16:26.400
"We can't afford to smash it."

16:26.400 --> 16:30.560
So I came off the plane, and everybody looked really downtrodden,

16:30.560 --> 16:32.920
was looking at the floor...

16:32.920 --> 16:37.160
And I went, "Why are you looking so sad?"

16:37.160 --> 16:39.440
And they said, "Unfortunately,

16:39.440 --> 16:44.400
"one of the precision drivers has knocked the camera off the cliff

16:44.400 --> 16:48.800
"and taken out the front windscreen. So there's no windscreen.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.880
"Lamborghini can't send one for another day or so."

16:52.880 --> 16:56.760
So, for most of the video, it had to be done with no windscreen.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.720
So that's why you see me squinting.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.880
And actually trying to sing the song as well

17:00.880 --> 17:02.920
while driving the mountain road. Yeah.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.079
- We've got a clip now of Cosmic Girl. Bring back some memories.
- Yeah.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.800
# She's just a cosmic girl... #

17:10.800 --> 17:15.640
So now I understand why your hair is flopping about!

17:15.640 --> 17:17.680
You've quite clearly got no windscreen!

17:17.680 --> 17:20.480
Yep, there is no windscreen there. Yeah.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.359
I loved that car as well. I really loved that car.

17:23.359 --> 17:26.160
It was a real meaty, you know, proper, old Lamborghini.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.079
They're quite different to what they are now.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.720
Now that Audi have taken them over, it's a different ballgame.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.840
That was quite a handful, but it made a great noise.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.560
That's why we stuck it on the front of Travelling Without Moving.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.560
- OK, let's get down to business.
- Yeah.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.560
Now, you're a veteran down here. You've been around...

17:40.560 --> 17:44.360
I've been coming down here since William Woollard was running it.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.400
You've been around in the Liana, you've been around in the Lacetti...

17:47.400 --> 17:49.280
That was a beautiful car, the Liana.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.600
You were fastest in the Lacetti, I think, right?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.840
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.000
OK, so now you're going to go around in the GT86.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.680
How'd the training go with Chris?

17:56.680 --> 18:00.040
Yeah, I mean, you know, Chris's masterclass...

18:00.040 --> 18:01.600
So, it was...

18:01.600 --> 18:06.040
The car's obviously a lot better than before.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.400
It pleases me to actually come on with something

18:08.400 --> 18:11.440
that's at least two litre, that you can get something out of.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.360
And quite a nippy little thing, you know.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.600
- All right, let's take a look.
- Yeah, OK.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.920
- Jay?
- Yes.
- Last show of the series.
- Got it.
- You've got form here.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.720
Yes, I have got form.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.400
We've got a target.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.600
Sir Chris Hoy, 1:35.4.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.160
- Sir Chris Hoy. Pedal to the metal.
- Yeah.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.760
- Let's go.
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.880
I like it, I like it. Power now, power, power, power.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.920
Good work - we're not that far off Mr Hoy at the moment now.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.400
Sorry, Sir Hoy.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.680
Sir Chris!

18:45.680 --> 18:46.720
Right, third gear.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.080
Come on, I need you to push a bit harder, Jay,

18:50.080 --> 18:51.360
we're bit behind Chris here.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.120
- LUVVIE VOICE:
- Okey dokey, pushing hard, darling, pushing hard.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.760
Push it hard. Third gear.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.800
Oh-ho-ho!

18:59.800 --> 19:01.480
Right on the edge. Fourth gear.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.360
I'm not going to look at this bit,

19:05.360 --> 19:08.000
because you're going so quick through here it scares me.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.480
- BLEEP
- hell, Jay!

19:11.360 --> 19:13.160
From the 100, brake and turn.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.880
- Brake, turn, now.
- Turn, turn.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.520
Oh, we could be off here, we could be off here.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.680
And back on! Oh, nearly back on.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.120
I nearly got it back on.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.040
LAUGHTER

19:35.320 --> 19:36.760
Nice day for it.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.480
APPLAUSE

19:40.760 --> 19:41.960
Hey-hey!

19:41.960 --> 19:43.520
Whoo!

19:43.520 --> 19:45.360
Nice, nice.

19:45.360 --> 19:48.080
- Nice one, nice one.
- I mean, I wasn't trying.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.520
- LAUGHTER
- I wasn't trying.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.800
Definitely, definitely.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.480
We thought we'd actually come out the right way, just carry on.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.200
Nothing happened, you didn't see that.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.240
A definite change of underwear, definitely.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.440
- Around once, around twice...
- Yeah, lovely, yeah.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.160
What do you think, Chris? Do you think he's got a shot at the title?

20:03.160 --> 20:05.120
Yeah, committed. You only have offs like that

20:05.120 --> 20:07.040
if you're really, really trying round here.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.280
People don't know how unforgiving the circuit is.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.160
If you get it half a foot wrong there, you're straight off.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.120
So he's going to be quick.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.840
- We'll see how you did just a little bit later in the show.
- OK, cool.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.080
Right now, I want to talk about 4x4s.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.480
See, if you want an upmarket, family SUV,

20:21.480 --> 20:23.960
right now, you've got a lot of options.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.000
You could have a Range Rover, you could have an Audi Q7,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.840
you could have a Merc GLS.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.160
But they're all so...mainstream.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.640
Thankfully, there is another option,

20:33.640 --> 20:35.680
and it comes...from Russia.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.720
This is the Avtoros Shaman,

20:40.720 --> 20:42.520
and it is big.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.160
Really big.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.200
HE WHISTLES

20:48.200 --> 20:50.560
Straight away, you can see it has eight wheels,

20:50.560 --> 20:53.520
which is the same as two Range Rovers.

20:53.520 --> 20:58.280
But it costs £88,000, about the same as just one Range Rover.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.280
So, on a pound-per-axle basis, the Shaman is a steal.

21:07.040 --> 21:11.040
And back here, you get seating for...

21:11.040 --> 21:13.520
everyone you've ever met.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.760
And there's an escape hatch, in case of an emergency.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.960
Like if Uncle Phil had the egg salad for lunch.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.280
HE BREATHES IN Oh!

21:26.080 --> 21:28.680
And there's a central driving position.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.200
Just like the McLaren F1.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.440
And the similarities to the F1 don't end there.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.440
Like the F1, the Shaman also has...

21:35.440 --> 21:37.000
a...

21:37.000 --> 21:38.920
erm...

21:38.920 --> 21:40.880
steering wheel!

21:40.880 --> 21:42.760
OK. Here we go.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.560
Now, like all the best modern SUVs,

21:47.560 --> 21:50.320
the Shaman is right at home in the centre of town.

21:50.320 --> 21:53.200
Whether it's the school run or popping out for groceries

21:53.200 --> 21:55.640
or nipping to the pub for a quick game of darts,

21:55.640 --> 21:57.120
the Shaman will do it all.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.760
Oh boy, this is tight.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.280
But like all the best modern SUVs

22:03.280 --> 22:06.560
it's even better suited to the open road.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.240
OK, it's not exactly supersonic.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.800
The Shaman will do 0-60 in...

22:20.840 --> 22:22.120
..never.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.240
With its sensible three-litre diesel,

22:24.240 --> 22:28.360
it has a whopping top speed of 44mph.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.640
And that's a good thing.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.040
It encourages you to relax.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.920
To...

22:35.920 --> 22:37.280
watch the world go by.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.960
And it's just as sensible on the inside.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.520
You've got a sat nav from the '90s.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.920
Some temperature controls from the '80s.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.800
You've got a speedometer and a rev counter

22:48.800 --> 22:51.200
which are basically irrelevant.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.480
And that's pretty much it.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.040
Elegant simplicity.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.160
Oh, what's that guy doing?

22:58.160 --> 22:59.400
That doesn't look good.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.920
Oh, looks like you're in a jam.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.720
HE CACKLES

23:05.720 --> 23:08.720
Should be able to get you out of there. Let me pull up a little.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.840
He smells like whisky.

23:11.320 --> 23:14.480
OK, not what I had in mind, but let's talk towing.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.440
Now, according to the Caravan Club,

23:16.440 --> 23:19.840
the choice SUV is the BMW X5.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.440
But that only pulls 3.5 tonnes.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.080
The Shaman will tow 12.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.160
So if you've got a local moon that's out of alignment,

23:28.160 --> 23:30.120
the Shaman will set it straight.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.160
Sweet!

23:31.160 --> 23:32.200
Thank you!

23:33.640 --> 23:35.280
Right, back to business.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.000
Next up, fuel economy.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.840
I know what you're thinking - that thing looks thirsty.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.680
Well, it is.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.520
It gets about 11 miles to the gallon. And it makes you wonder,

23:45.520 --> 23:48.520
am I going to have to refuel it every single day?

23:48.520 --> 23:53.640
Well, no, you're not, because the Shaman holds 260 litres of diesel.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.360
It's a supertanker.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.680
So realistically,

23:56.680 --> 23:59.760
you're only going to have to refuel it about every other day.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.080
Oh, wait - is that a flare?

24:12.640 --> 24:15.000
Anyone else around to help them?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.400
Just me then, huh?

24:19.920 --> 24:21.640
Ah, OK.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.600
Right, well, this is a waste of time.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.840
Modern SUV drivers don't even go off-road.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.520
But since I'm apparently the only one who can help,

24:31.520 --> 24:34.440
we might as well cover all-terrain ability.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.400
Ground clearance, half a metre.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.440
Half a metre!

24:40.000 --> 24:42.200
And these giant tyres may look destructive,

24:42.200 --> 24:46.360
but their huge surface area means they tread lightly over the terrain.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.440
Snowshoes, not stilettos.

24:49.440 --> 24:53.520
And if you factor in its eight-wheel drive with independent steering,

24:53.520 --> 24:56.480
you can approach any off-road excursion with confidence.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.640
I can't wait to see the looks on their faces

24:59.640 --> 25:01.400
when they see this thing coming.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.040
Hi.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.080
You're, erm...

25:17.000 --> 25:18.440
You're naked.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.760
We're naked ramblers.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.560
We're lost!

25:22.560 --> 25:26.160
- Well, do you need a ride?
- Oh, yes.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.640
OK, come on. Let's...

25:29.800 --> 25:31.120
Let's go.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.640
Up you go.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.440
Ooh.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.480
OK.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.000
All... OK.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
All righty. Wow. That's a lot for the eyes.

26:01.240 --> 26:05.240
Sure hope we don't crash. This would be a tricky one to explain.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.520
No need for hugs or anything. We're OK.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.800
Well, there's an image that'll be stuck in my mind forever.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.440
OK, where were we?

26:17.440 --> 26:19.520
Ah, yes, let's talk refinement.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.880
Some might complain that, on the move,

26:23.880 --> 26:27.000
the Shaman isn't the quietest of SUVs on the market.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.440
ENGINE ROARS

26:28.440 --> 26:30.120
True.

26:30.120 --> 26:33.200
When you're up and running there is some engine noise

26:33.200 --> 26:35.720
and some road noise.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.680
But that's a good thing.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.720
Because, too often, the driving experience is interrupted by...

26:41.720 --> 26:44.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:44.000 --> 26:45.120
Looks like Lassie.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.400
BARKS

26:46.400 --> 26:47.760
Seriously?

26:47.760 --> 26:48.840
Lassie now?

26:51.280 --> 26:52.320
What's wrong?

26:53.480 --> 26:55.080
What's wrong?

26:55.080 --> 26:57.360
DOG WHINES

26:57.360 --> 26:59.440
What, little Timmy's stuck down a well?

26:59.440 --> 27:01.040
Again? WHINES

27:01.040 --> 27:02.080
OK.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.440
All right, show me the way, I'll follow you. Geez.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.120
OK, so, apparently,

27:09.120 --> 27:12.960
owning a Shaman does come with a few unwanted responsibilities.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.760
Where the hell is this dog taking me?

27:16.760 --> 27:19.160
And what kind of shampoo does she use?

27:19.160 --> 27:20.360
She's so shiny.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.440
Good girl, good girl.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.120
OK, we're going to get you outta here.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.040
Put that rope around you.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.840
No, not around your neck, no.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.240
Yeah, around your waist, good.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.280
OK.

27:38.920 --> 27:43.040
This winch is capable of lifting 5.6 metric tonnes.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.080
That's the equivalent of about 200 little Timmys.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.200
Kids today.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.160
Doesn't he have an iPad?

27:52.160 --> 27:53.280
DOG BARKS

27:53.280 --> 27:55.000
Whoa, whoa!

27:55.000 --> 27:56.520
Lassie, language!

27:56.520 --> 27:58.520
WHINES

27:58.520 --> 28:00.000
We're all tired.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.240
All in all, though,

28:05.240 --> 28:07.520
having to take on the odd rescue mission is

28:07.520 --> 28:12.440
a small price to pay for a car that is just so rewarding.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.520
It's an SUV for the driver who cares about driving.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.120
The noise, the lack of unnecessary technology.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.000
It all connects you with what's really important.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.480
The mechanical experience.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.280
Really, I'm struggling to see a downside

28:30.280 --> 28:32.880
to this magnificent machine.

28:32.880 --> 28:37.120
So there you have it - Russia's answer to the modern SUV.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.920
And, honestly, I would definitely recommend it.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.040
Sure, a Mercedes GLS is a little quicker,

28:43.040 --> 28:46.280
and an Audi Q7 is slightly more refined,

28:46.280 --> 28:48.560
but the Shaman is practical,

28:48.560 --> 28:50.600
it's spacious...

28:50.600 --> 28:52.520
and...

28:52.520 --> 28:53.640
Oh, did I not mention?

28:56.840 --> 28:57.880
It swims.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.920
With all this saving people, maybe I could join the Avengers.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.840
I could be...

29:07.840 --> 29:09.200
The Shamanator.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.400
Yeah, I like it.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.920
Be there in a couple minutes.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
Maybe 15.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.520
Maybe 20.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.160
APPLAUSE

29:28.480 --> 29:31.320
Now you're talking! This thing's massive!

29:31.320 --> 29:32.440
This...

29:32.440 --> 29:34.080
This is my kind of family SUV.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.880
Exactly. Why would you want a Range Rover

29:35.880 --> 29:37.320
when you could have one of these?

29:37.320 --> 29:41.040
I'm telling you, I can see literally no downsides to this car.

29:41.040 --> 29:45.240
No. Also, 88 grand. I mean, that is a lot of wheels for the money.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.720
Yeah, and way cheaper than a helicopter.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.520
I'm sorry, what, a helicopter?

29:49.520 --> 29:51.960
Yeah, that's how the Shaman is marketed -

29:51.960 --> 29:54.320
as a helicopter alternative.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.720
Think about it, OK?

29:55.720 --> 29:58.440
If you needed to get somewhere in the middle of nowhere,

29:58.440 --> 30:03.240
hundreds of miles from the nearest road - deepest, darkest Russia -

30:03.240 --> 30:06.200
it's basically this or a helicopter.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.400
You know how many naked ramblers you can fit in a helicopter?

30:09.400 --> 30:13.120
- No.
- Yeah, neither do I. And I do not want to find out.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.160
Imagine the turbulence and the downdraught.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.640
All that naked skin flopping around. I don't... No, no.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.800
Chris!

30:19.800 --> 30:22.520
So what do you think? Trade in the helicopter, get one of those?

30:22.520 --> 30:26.080
I doubt it. I could do without the naked people in there.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.120
You know, it's funny, because the best Russian vehicle is the

30:29.120 --> 30:31.640
really old Kamaz with the really thin wheels?

30:31.640 --> 30:33.400
Almost looks like a loaf of bread?

30:33.400 --> 30:36.480
And everyone in Russia uses those. They go anywhere.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.120
And then they use the old eight-wheelers as well.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.480
Eight-wheel steering things.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.760
- It was fun to drive.
- Yeah, yeah.

30:42.760 --> 30:46.760
OK, I'd like to show you a new family car from America. OK?

30:46.760 --> 30:50.720
It's made by Dodge and it's called the Demon. Let's take a look.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.080
Nice.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.200
Look at that, that's a nice-looking car, right?

30:54.200 --> 30:57.320
Four seats, nice big trunk, or boot.

30:57.320 --> 31:01.920
Would you like to know how fast that car goes from 0-60mph?

31:01.920 --> 31:05.200
- You tell me, Matt.
- 2.3 seconds.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.760
That is the fastest-accelerating car ever made.

31:08.760 --> 31:13.200
Faster than a 918 Spyder, faster than a LaFerrari...

31:13.200 --> 31:14.840
Faster than...everything.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.880
Until it gets to the first corner!

31:16.880 --> 31:19.120
LAUGHTER

31:19.120 --> 31:21.920
Exactly. OK, look, here's another picture.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.440
That is an official Dodge photograph.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.320
"I'm having trouble laying my power down."

31:26.320 --> 31:29.320
- Yeah, that is how you sell a car. Huh?
- Look at that!

31:29.320 --> 31:31.120
OK, how much power does that thing have?

31:31.120 --> 31:35.960
OK, you're going to love this - it has 840 horsepower.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.120
- That's ridiculous. And that's a tuner car, surely?
- No, no.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.480
No, no, no.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.760
In America, you can go into your local Dodge dealer

31:42.760 --> 31:44.440
and buy one of those bad boys.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.720
And you know the best part about the whole thing?

31:46.720 --> 31:49.600
If you put your foot all the way down and really stand on it,

31:49.600 --> 31:52.000
the front wheels will come off the ground.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.240
- The car does wheelies.
- It's a funny car!

31:54.240 --> 31:56.800
How cool is that? Yeah, no, take a look. We have a clip.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.440
- GRUFF VOICEOVER:
- 'You don't want the truth.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.760
'You can't handle the truth!'

32:02.760 --> 32:04.400
Come on!

32:04.400 --> 32:05.440
That's nuts!

32:05.440 --> 32:08.680
- Huh?
- See the way the sidewall just creased on the tyre?

32:08.680 --> 32:09.960
That's unbelievable.

32:09.960 --> 32:13.600
OK, so just to recap, you've got McLaren pushing the boundaries of

32:13.600 --> 32:18.680
technology, using carbon fibre, aerodynamics - new language.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.160
And you've got Dodge saying, screw that, screw technology, we're

32:22.160 --> 32:25.840
just going to insert a big V8 engine and make it as sophisticated as...

32:25.840 --> 32:27.080
an anvil.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.600
That's right. What's your point?

32:28.600 --> 32:31.680
It's absolutely brilliant. All of it's brilliant! I love it.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.800
I know. We are totally driving that next series.

32:34.800 --> 32:38.360
OK, now, the Formula 1 season is back under way.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.880
But for the first time in over 30 years,

32:40.880 --> 32:44.840
F1 doesn't have a certain man running it - Bernie Ecclestone.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.520
See, at the start of this year,

32:46.520 --> 32:49.840
a company called Liberty Media took control of Formula 1.

32:49.840 --> 32:53.440
Since then, Bernie has stayed very quiet about the whole affair

32:53.440 --> 32:55.800
and the honorary title Liberty gave him.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.120
But a couple of weeks ago, Bernie got in touch,

32:58.120 --> 33:00.680
asking if we'd like to have a little chat.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.800
And you don't say no to Bernie, so we didn't.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.960
And he also said that he'd only talk to one guy -

33:05.960 --> 33:07.480
Eddie Jordan.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.920
You all right, Bernie?

33:08.920 --> 33:10.760
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's have fun, man.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.800
Now, Liberty.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.360
They've given you this great title, I'm kind of confused -

33:17.360 --> 33:20.040
what does that title mean? Is it a gagging order?

33:20.040 --> 33:21.880
I don't know, really.

33:21.880 --> 33:27.160
It's a little bit like giving a hitman a gun and no bullets.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.800
That's not very clever.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.320
Oh, but I've got enough money to buy the bullets.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.200
Bernie, they said, or you said about them,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.400
that they should have killed you, not wound you.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.920
What did you mean by that?

33:37.920 --> 33:40.160
No, I didn't actually say me at all.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.680
- That isn't what I said.
- OK, well, tell us what you said, then.

33:42.680 --> 33:45.800
I said the trouble with all sort of animals,

33:45.800 --> 33:49.200
if you want to kill them, you have to kill them, don't wound them.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.640
Ah, but it's the same meaning, isn't it, Bernie?

33:51.640 --> 33:53.680
You were giving a little message to them.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.400
- It depends how people...
- Be careful.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.360
- ..want to take meanings, doesn't it?
- OK.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.240
Formula 1 is in good hands, Bernie?

33:59.240 --> 34:01.080
Now? I hope so.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.440
Can it improve without you?

34:02.440 --> 34:04.120
I'm sure it will.

34:04.120 --> 34:07.560
The problem over the last two or three years has simply been

34:07.560 --> 34:11.199
no competition. And now it looks like we've got some.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.000
Ferrari, can they win the championship this year?

34:14.000 --> 34:17.080
Honestly, I shouldn't say this, but I hope they do.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.760
But I don't think they will.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.520
It's good for business?

34:20.520 --> 34:24.440
If we lost Ferrari, over the years, we'd had have been in trouble.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.239
Formula 1 is Ferrari and Ferrari is Formula 1.

34:28.960 --> 34:32.639
For many years, I've been intrigued about the way you were able

34:32.639 --> 34:35.880
to bring the championship right to the last race.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.440
I mean, you're fixing that, aren't you?

34:38.440 --> 34:40.000
Not at all.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.159
The teams may have, but I don't.

34:42.159 --> 34:46.239
Maybe the teams get together and decide to split the money secretly

34:46.239 --> 34:49.600
or something to make sure this happens, I don't know.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.520
You are joking, we know that.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.080
But it is remarkable, isn't it?

34:54.080 --> 34:55.920
I'm just lucky.

34:55.920 --> 35:00.200
Where would you see the possible improvements?

35:00.200 --> 35:03.960
Well, I think we ought to get rid of a lot of the silly regulations

35:03.960 --> 35:05.680
that restrict so many things

35:05.680 --> 35:09.240
for the drivers and the people building cars.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.480
It's become an engineers' championship,

35:11.480 --> 35:12.920
not a drivers' championship.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.280
It's the drivers that should be driving the cars.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.800
They are the ones that should win the races and get all the credit

35:18.800 --> 35:20.520
for doing what they've done.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.440
Who was the best one, in your view?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.240
Best driver...

35:25.240 --> 35:28.720
Nobody ever agrees with me. I think it was Alain Prost.

35:28.720 --> 35:33.120
Because he always had competition in the team,

35:33.120 --> 35:35.640
he lost two World Championships

35:35.640 --> 35:39.040
by a small margin, through bad luck on his part.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.520
So, he should be credited as being the best.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.400
I want to talk about your cars.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.440
I've got to ask you, you don't suppose that you might have

35:47.440 --> 35:50.680
the getaway car from the Great Train Robbery there, by any chance?

35:50.680 --> 35:53.600
No, I wish I could find it. I don't know which one I used at the time.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.320
- Ah, OK!
- HE CHUCKLES

35:55.320 --> 35:58.080
Bernie, because, you know, we laugh and joke about it,

35:58.080 --> 36:01.320
but there are still a body of people who associate you with

36:01.320 --> 36:05.440
- the Great Train Robbery. Why do you think that is?
- No idea, no idea.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.920
Wasn't enough money on that train, actually.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.840
Bernie, before we wrap up,

36:09.840 --> 36:13.760
I've just got a couple of little names that I'd perhaps like

36:13.760 --> 36:19.000
maybe for you to tell us, in your own words, what they mean.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.040
Ferrari.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.680
Special.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.240
McLaren.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.320
Trying hard. Trying hard.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.200
Max Verstappen.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.080
He's really, really super.

36:31.080 --> 36:33.640
He's going to be a world champion, for sure.

36:33.640 --> 36:36.880
Finally, Bernie - Lewis Hamilton.

36:36.880 --> 36:40.200
Best thing that happened for Formula One for a long, long time.

36:40.200 --> 36:43.880
Good ambassador. Super...

36:43.880 --> 36:45.720
Certainly the best driver of this...

36:45.720 --> 36:48.320
- You know, the last ten years.
- Of his era.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.640
Bernie Ecclestone.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

37:02.800 --> 37:05.280
Nobody's heard from Eddie since that interview...

37:05.280 --> 37:06.840
LAUGHTER

37:06.840 --> 37:08.840
Where is he? Don't mess with Bernie!

37:08.840 --> 37:10.480
OK.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.000
The time has come.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.360
The time has come, as it always does.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.840
- The time has come to see your lap. How do you think you did?
- Um...

37:18.840 --> 37:23.280
Well, you know, you can never tell, can you? I mean, um...

37:23.280 --> 37:25.960
- I hate this bit!
- LAUGHTER

37:25.960 --> 37:29.840
I got up this morning thinking, "Why do I put myself through it?"

37:29.840 --> 37:32.280
You know he takes it seriously, though. Look at his shoes -

37:32.280 --> 37:33.600
racing driver's shoes.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.480
- Yeah, yeah.
- It matters.
- Put him out of his misery, Matt.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.600
- All right, let's take a look, come on.
- OK. Thank you.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.680
Off the line, that's a good, clean start.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.680
Come on, then, young lady - the Toyota GT86,

37:47.680 --> 37:50.520
from the Land of the Rising Sun!

37:50.520 --> 37:53.480
OK, the line was good coming into first...

37:53.480 --> 37:55.240
A little bit wide there.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.640
And you turned a bit wide, but you were on the power early.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.720
And using all the circuit. That's good, that's really good there.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.560
Feels a bit smoother to me.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.800
Good, and you've stopped the car.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.200
Some people barrel in there too fast. I reckon your speed was right.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.680
Line good coming out.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.120
Don't miss the gear!

38:14.120 --> 38:15.720
You didn't miss the gear, you see?

38:15.720 --> 38:17.760
You blithering idiot!

38:17.760 --> 38:20.200
OK, down the back straight.

38:26.640 --> 38:29.280
Ah, now, you're a bit wide there. A little bit wide.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.920
Get it in. GET IT IN!

38:31.920 --> 38:35.200
And you're self-flagellating, which is a good sign.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.120
- Using all the circuit there.
- Come on!

38:38.120 --> 38:40.840
I've never looked too good in a helmet, have I, really?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.160
No guts, no glory!

38:46.000 --> 38:49.640
It feels like the one. It feels like the one.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.960
This is aggressive. This is aggressive!

38:51.960 --> 38:55.120
The trial brake was good. That was your new line through there.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.360
And you failed to do a 720 there, which is good.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.560
And now, over the line...

38:59.560 --> 39:01.680
- OK, right.
- APPLAUSE

39:02.800 --> 39:04.200
Well done.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.960
All right. Come on, what do you think? You feeling confident?

39:13.960 --> 39:16.360
Oh, I don't know. I don't know!

39:16.360 --> 39:19.000
You know, um, it's, um, it's tricky.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.800
You know, it's a tricky little... That Hammerhead is tricky.

39:21.800 --> 39:25.600
You just feel where you're losing bits and bobs and feel where

39:25.600 --> 39:29.240
you're losing time, and there's a lot of different lines to take,

39:29.240 --> 39:33.920
- so, um, who knows? But just... Just get on with it!
- Now, we know...

39:33.920 --> 39:37.320
- We know you now.
- Yeah.
- You're fairly competitive.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.560
We know you're not looking down in this section here.

39:39.560 --> 39:43.520
You're looking up there, with the Hoy and the Noble and the Whitlock.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.640
- Right?
- Yeah, I kind of am up there, yeah. I'm looking up there, yeah.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.560
That's where you want to be. OK.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.720
Jay Kay...

39:50.720 --> 39:52.600
You did it...

39:52.600 --> 39:54.040
JAY CHUCKLES

39:55.840 --> 39:58.080
This is my favourite part. I love it!

39:58.080 --> 39:59.760
Oh, yeah, milk it!

39:59.760 --> 40:03.240
- Milk it, milk it!
- You did it in one minute...

40:04.920 --> 40:06.280
- ..30...
- Yes?

40:07.400 --> 40:09.640
6... GROANS

40:09.640 --> 40:11.240
..point 1.

40:12.480 --> 40:16.160
Seven tenths off a bloke who's done Le Mans!

40:16.160 --> 40:18.960
- Happy?
- Yeah, yeah, good.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.360
- Come on, come on!
- Second fastest.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.960
Ladies and gentlemen, Jay Kay!

40:26.400 --> 40:29.600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:34.640 --> 40:39.240
Now, I want to talk about the ugliest car ever made,

40:39.240 --> 40:43.440
because there is one that stands head and hideous shoulders

40:43.440 --> 40:49.280
- above all others. Feast your eyes on this.
- This is the SsangYong Rodius,

40:49.280 --> 40:53.240
- and it is truly revolting!
- Yeah, but, here's the thing.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.720
Sure, the Rodius might be horrible to look at,

40:55.720 --> 40:58.840
but it has a beautiful secret.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.600
And to reveal that secret, Rory took me and this

41:01.600 --> 41:06.400
Korean masterpiece on a little road trip to Southampton.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.080
Well, I've got to say, I'm impressed.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.720
It's as gross on the inside as it is on the outside.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.920
This thing is disgusting!

41:18.920 --> 41:23.000
- Better be good, whatever we're doing in Southampton.
- Just you wait.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.280
'Well, at least I didn't have to wait long.'

41:27.280 --> 41:28.680
Pull in here.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.200
It's a boat yard, Rory. Why are we going to a boat yard?

41:31.200 --> 41:33.560
Are we going to drive into the ocean? That's a good call.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.640
OK, this is perfect.

41:34.640 --> 41:35.840
'In fact...'

41:35.840 --> 41:37.080
Come here.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.400
'..Rory had something else in mind.'

41:39.400 --> 41:41.960
Look, here's what you need to know about the Rodius, OK?

41:41.960 --> 41:45.680
- It was designed by a guy called Ken Greenley...
- Who was blind?

41:45.680 --> 41:49.040
Who was head of vehicle design at London's Royal College of Arts,

41:49.040 --> 41:50.920
and he knew what he was talking about.

41:50.920 --> 41:55.440
And the Rodius was inspired by the design of luxury yachts.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.520
No, it wasn't!

41:57.520 --> 41:59.200
Come here, check this out, look.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.280
How about now?

42:05.520 --> 42:07.040
No, I don't see it.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.360
Dude, look.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.880
Look at the lines, OK, look at the S-shape, the way it flows.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.640
That's nautical.

42:13.640 --> 42:16.520
The Rodius might be a hideous car,

42:16.520 --> 42:18.800
but it was never supposed to be a car,

42:18.800 --> 42:20.840
it was supposed to be a yacht.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.640
We are going to turn the SsangYong into a yacht.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.120
Hey, does this mean we get to cut it up?

42:27.120 --> 42:29.840
- Yeah.
- Excellent, I am in!

42:31.520 --> 42:33.360
We're going to do this for Ken Greenley.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.720
Who?

42:34.720 --> 42:36.560
- The blind guy.
- Yeah.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.960
Yeah...

42:38.960 --> 42:40.440
Psshww!

42:40.440 --> 42:42.400
'To see if Rory's idea would float,

42:42.400 --> 42:46.080
'we enlisted the help of one of Southampton's leading boatbuilders.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.520
'A man called Digby.'

42:48.520 --> 42:50.000
What are the problems, do you think,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.600
by trying to turn this thing into a boat?

42:52.600 --> 42:56.360
- What's the biggest hurdle?
- Capsizing. Very worst - death.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.160
- Death?
- Death.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.640
Huh.

42:59.640 --> 43:02.800
It's a very big car to make into a boat.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.160
But it already looks like a yacht.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.840
Well, that's...

43:06.840 --> 43:10.680
open for interpretation. We don't need to get into that so much.

43:10.680 --> 43:12.320
Can we make it happen?

43:12.320 --> 43:15.560
Um, if you look at basics of stability,

43:15.560 --> 43:18.120
you're putting tonnes of weight up there.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.200
If you start moving through the water at any sort of speed,

43:21.200 --> 43:24.760
as soon as you hit a wave, you're going to end up down here,

43:24.760 --> 43:28.720
and risking happy people becoming very much dead people.

43:28.720 --> 43:30.200
It's going to be difficult.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.080
- Do you think this is a bad idea?
- Oh, yes, it's a terrible idea.

43:33.080 --> 43:35.400
- But it's doable?
- Vaguely doable.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.560
- But doable?
- There's a chance.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.000
OK! That's all we need to hear.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.960
- Then we're doing it!
- Welcome on board.

43:40.960 --> 43:44.800
- Hey, let's hope that we live through this.
- Yeah, we'll be fine.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.640
'So, we set to work,

43:48.640 --> 43:51.840
'carefully extracting weight,

43:51.840 --> 43:54.960
'remodelling the stern and bow,

43:54.960 --> 43:56.920
'and delicately finessing the hull.'

43:56.920 --> 43:58.360
Oh, hot, hot, hot!

43:58.360 --> 44:00.360
Well, what do you think?

44:00.360 --> 44:02.240
Probably need another day.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.040
- Two days.
- Max.
- Yeah.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.880
SEAGULLS CRY

44:13.320 --> 44:14.840
At last...

44:16.240 --> 44:18.200
..she was ready for testing.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.120
And to do that,

44:21.120 --> 44:23.120
there was only one place to go.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.480
Monaco.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.640
What the hell am I doing here?

44:27.640 --> 44:29.840
This is genius, OK?

44:29.840 --> 44:33.480
We have unleashed the Rodius's inner beauty.

44:33.480 --> 44:38.600
It was inspired by yachts, and now it has become a yacht!

44:38.600 --> 44:40.440
You're going to love this, I'm telling you.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.320
Rory, bring her round!

44:42.320 --> 44:45.120
MUSIC: Power by Kanye West

44:48.240 --> 44:49.480
Woohoo!

44:49.480 --> 44:51.400
Come on! We did it!

44:51.400 --> 44:54.480
# No one man should have all that power

44:54.480 --> 44:57.680
# The clock's tickin' I just count the hours... #

44:57.680 --> 45:00.800
This is going to blow his mind!

45:00.800 --> 45:03.800
- Oh, my God.
- Look at that!

45:04.880 --> 45:06.960
That's right! That's right!

45:06.960 --> 45:08.880
MATT LAUGHS

45:08.880 --> 45:12.280
Rear Admiral Reid...at your service!

45:12.280 --> 45:13.560
Nice!

45:13.560 --> 45:15.360
There's a car in there!

45:15.360 --> 45:17.160
There's a car... There's...

45:17.160 --> 45:20.120
- It's really weird, now I can't un-see it!
- Yeah!

45:20.120 --> 45:24.480
- Because I can sort of see a boat.
- It makes perfect sense!

45:24.480 --> 45:27.120
- It works, right?
- This is what it was born for!

45:27.120 --> 45:29.200
It's actually disturbing.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.200
Rory's dressed as Captain Birdseye...

45:31.200 --> 45:33.240
- Admiral!
- ..and he's...

45:33.240 --> 45:35.480
Admiral Birdseye.

45:35.480 --> 45:38.920
This is a luxury yacht, and when you're the admiral of

45:38.920 --> 45:42.040
a luxury yacht, you have to look the part. Hence the outfit.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.360
He does look good. You've got to admit, he looks good.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.760
No, the boat looks good.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.560
It's a super-yacht. Enough with the boat talk!

45:48.560 --> 45:52.320
How did you create it? Did you buy the hull of a speedboat

45:52.320 --> 45:54.160
and then just drive the Rodius

45:54.160 --> 45:56.720
as fast as you could into the back of it?

45:56.720 --> 45:59.680
Wait till you see the inside, it's killer. Back it in here.

45:59.680 --> 46:01.920
- I'll bring her round.
- Yeah, swing it around.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.400
He's still getting the hang of driving it.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.640
Give me a minute!

46:05.640 --> 46:07.400
Right in there somewhere...

46:09.320 --> 46:11.560
THUD! Beautiful.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.480
- So...
- Huh?
- ..you're impressed, right?

46:14.480 --> 46:16.080
Did you do this on your own?

46:16.080 --> 46:18.520
We... We had a bit of help.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.120
Yeah, we had a little help from a guy called Digby,

46:21.120 --> 46:23.520
who uses the word "death" a lot,

46:23.520 --> 46:25.440
but that's not what's important.

46:25.440 --> 46:29.080
No, what's important is, climb aboard the SsangYacht,

46:29.080 --> 46:33.120
and all of your land-based worries will simply wash away.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.720
You can swim, right?

46:34.720 --> 46:36.880
- What?
- MATT AND RORY LAUGH

46:36.880 --> 46:38.760
This is absurd.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.640
So, the seats have stayed,

46:40.640 --> 46:42.640
the dashboard has stayed.

46:42.640 --> 46:46.800
This material here, this sort of fake marble, faux marble -

46:46.800 --> 46:48.200
what is it?

46:48.200 --> 46:51.960
That's real, genuine...fake marble.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.320
- What's that whirring sound?
- It's a bilge pump,

46:54.320 --> 46:57.280
comes on automatically if water gets in the hull.

46:57.280 --> 46:59.640
- I'm sorry?
- What?

47:01.880 --> 47:05.280
'While Chris came to terms with the awesomeness of our creation,

47:05.280 --> 47:07.320
'we broke out the big guns.'

47:07.320 --> 47:09.200
Ready?

47:09.200 --> 47:12.080
- Whoa!
- Flatscreen TV!

47:12.080 --> 47:15.800
As if out of nowhere, it magically appears!

47:15.800 --> 47:18.320
- And disappears.
- If you want it to.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.840
- Boom!
- You are a pair of court jesters, aren't you?

47:21.840 --> 47:24.200
What are you talking about? This thing is fantastic.

47:24.200 --> 47:26.280
So, you've been gone for weeks,

47:26.280 --> 47:29.600
and the sum total of your endeavours is a 12-inch TV screen

47:29.600 --> 47:32.560
that will only stay upright if you're holding a rope.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.640
It's 15-inch.

47:34.640 --> 47:37.080
- You like music, right?
- Yeah.

47:37.080 --> 47:39.040
Sit right here, please.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.440
Right there.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.240
Now, snap your fingers.

47:44.240 --> 47:46.640
- Oh, look at that!
- Boom!

47:46.640 --> 47:48.600
- Huh?
- Grand piano!

47:48.600 --> 47:49.880
Check this out!

47:49.880 --> 47:54.120
HE PLAYS THE EASTENDERS THEME BADLY

47:56.280 --> 47:59.800
Do we have to go and make it move at some point?

47:59.800 --> 48:02.080
'Hell, yes, we did.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.720
'And to get Chris on board once and for all,

48:04.720 --> 48:06.880
'we gave him the first go.'

48:08.080 --> 48:09.800
Yeah, baby!

48:09.800 --> 48:12.680
- Whoa!
- The SsangYacht lives!

48:17.120 --> 48:18.920
This thing rocks, man!

48:19.920 --> 48:21.360
This is insane!

48:24.240 --> 48:26.760
What I will say is, it's got good power.

48:26.760 --> 48:29.040
But I thought the Rodius had a ropey old Merc diesel.

48:29.040 --> 48:32.320
No, no, no, now it's got two Volvo V-6 engines.

48:32.320 --> 48:35.240
So that gives us a total of 400 horsepower.

48:35.240 --> 48:36.800
How fast will it go?

48:36.800 --> 48:38.720
- I don't know.
- I have no idea.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.640
- There's only one way to find out, isn't there?
- Nail it!

48:43.080 --> 48:44.600
Whoo!

48:47.600 --> 48:49.680
That's 25 knots, right there!

48:51.440 --> 48:53.480
In a minivan, on the sea!

48:53.480 --> 48:55.840
THEY LAUGH

48:58.840 --> 49:00.800
I have to say

49:00.800 --> 49:04.000
that it is much better than I expected,

49:04.000 --> 49:08.400
and it is better to drive than the road-going SsangYong Rodius.

49:08.400 --> 49:13.080
And I will begrudgingly concede that it's not utter crap.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.160
- Excellent!
- Thank you.

49:15.160 --> 49:18.160
It's a winner! Well done, Rory! Yeah!

49:19.680 --> 49:24.800
So, I took the liberty of contacting leading luxury boat magazine

49:24.800 --> 49:29.040
Boat International, right, and asked them if they'd like to review it,

49:29.040 --> 49:32.160
and they said they're sending over their best reviewer.

49:32.160 --> 49:35.360
- Yeah!
- OK!
- OK.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.440
'So, we went to meet up with him.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.520
'And inevitably...'

49:39.520 --> 49:41.760
- No!
- 'Yup.'

49:41.760 --> 49:43.480
- EDDIE:
- Ahoy! Afternoon, boys.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.760
Are you reviewing our boat?

49:45.760 --> 49:50.600
Boat International correspondent at your service.

49:50.600 --> 49:54.040
Yeah, no, it says right here, Eddie Jordan.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.680
'Nevertheless, keen to make a big first impression,

49:56.680 --> 50:00.600
'we suggested the first test be performance.'

50:00.600 --> 50:02.640
Eddie, what do you say, let's run

50:02.640 --> 50:04.800
a quarter-of-a-nautical-mile drag race?

50:04.800 --> 50:08.840
- Down to that "booey" out there and back.
- Oh, OK.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.600
- What's a booey?
- Shut it!

50:12.320 --> 50:15.480
Three, two, one, go!

50:15.480 --> 50:16.840
Stand on it!

50:18.160 --> 50:19.520
Hold on!

50:21.680 --> 50:24.160
Oh, we've got the jump on him!

50:24.160 --> 50:26.120
Come on, baby, come on!

50:27.320 --> 50:31.200
Bloody hell, Rory, slow down! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

50:31.200 --> 50:34.440
I don't want to die!

50:34.440 --> 50:36.120
Come on!

50:36.120 --> 50:38.200
How many times have you driven a boat this fast?

50:38.200 --> 50:39.240
None!

50:40.640 --> 50:43.720
I ain't backing out. Just hold on!

50:43.720 --> 50:45.520
- Whoo!
- Aah!

50:45.520 --> 50:48.760
God, this is slow. Look at that crappy boat there!

50:48.760 --> 50:50.520
Nice and easy round the booey.

50:50.520 --> 50:51.960
- Left!
- Go, go, go!

50:53.880 --> 50:57.320
- Here we go, steady, baby!
- He's catching us, he's catching us!

50:57.320 --> 50:59.720
Now we're smokin'!

50:59.720 --> 51:01.400
Quick!

51:01.400 --> 51:04.160
Oh, when we get up speed, we're going to...

51:04.160 --> 51:05.560
Ohh!

51:05.560 --> 51:07.000
THEY WHOOP AND CHEER

51:07.000 --> 51:08.960
Way to go, Rory, way to go!

51:08.960 --> 51:13.640
Now, stop the boat and never, ever drive that fast again with me in it!

51:13.640 --> 51:15.440
Ever!

51:15.440 --> 51:17.720
I hate that boat!

51:17.720 --> 51:20.720
'The review was off to a rocky start.

51:20.720 --> 51:25.240
'And once we'd slightly reduced the risk of being buried at sea...'

51:25.240 --> 51:26.760
There we go.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.600
'..our expert set us straight.'

51:28.600 --> 51:31.600
Guys, you're completely missing the point.

51:31.600 --> 51:34.520
'Apparently, luxury yachts aren't about speed,

51:34.520 --> 51:37.120
'they're about showing off your toys...'

51:37.120 --> 51:38.880
Where's he gone? Where'd he go?

51:38.880 --> 51:40.800
'..as he then demonstrated.'

51:43.080 --> 51:46.000
Ha-ha! This is what I'm talking about!

51:48.040 --> 51:49.760
Look at him go!

51:51.560 --> 51:52.960
Wow!

51:54.320 --> 51:56.400
He's quick for an old guy, isn't he?

52:02.840 --> 52:05.440
All right, so he's got toys on his boat.

52:05.440 --> 52:08.960
We've got toys. Do we have toys?

52:08.960 --> 52:10.560
'Hell, yes, we did.'

52:12.200 --> 52:14.480
Whoo! Nice work, Harris!

52:14.480 --> 52:18.520
- Nice work!
- Yeah, Eddie, take that, baby!

52:19.520 --> 52:23.480
- # I'll be ready
- I'll be ready... #

52:23.480 --> 52:28.040
- This guy is a master of all forms of transport!
- He's great!

52:28.040 --> 52:30.360
# ..I'll be ready... #

52:30.360 --> 52:31.480
No!

52:32.840 --> 52:35.560
You know, I'm looking through Boat International,

52:35.560 --> 52:37.560
and I don't see any other super-yacht

52:37.560 --> 52:39.080
towing people off the back.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.200
We are blazing a trail!

52:43.200 --> 52:44.880
How is he looking?

52:47.720 --> 52:48.840
He's down!

52:48.840 --> 52:50.360
He's down, he's down.

52:53.400 --> 52:55.520
'Well, we'd proven our point,

52:55.520 --> 52:57.040
'and once we'd found Chris,

52:57.040 --> 52:59.640
'he was loving the SsangYacht as much as we were.'

52:59.640 --> 53:03.880
We have just proved you can ski behind a Korean MPV!

53:03.880 --> 53:07.040
Eddie Jordan, stuff you!

53:07.040 --> 53:08.280
THEY LAUGH

53:08.280 --> 53:09.440
Ooh!

53:09.440 --> 53:12.200
- Careful of the paint job, man!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.120
Do you think that will go down as a good review?

53:14.120 --> 53:16.200
- Well done, buddy, well done.
- He's going to love it.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.640
'But he didn't.'

53:18.640 --> 53:20.760
For heaven's sake!

53:20.760 --> 53:24.840
Being able to water-ski behind it doesn't make it a luxury yacht.

53:24.840 --> 53:27.760
By the time we are finished with you, you will be convinced

53:27.760 --> 53:32.040
that this thing is the future of luxury yachting.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.880
'We decided to bring Eddie aboard

53:33.880 --> 53:36.360
'and show him the SsangYacht's hidden depths,

53:36.360 --> 53:40.760
'so we headed for Monaco's legendary marina where, frankly,

53:40.760 --> 53:42.960
'we blended right in.'

53:42.960 --> 53:44.480
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

53:44.480 --> 53:48.360
I think we could squeeze in right behind him, we won't have to pay.

53:48.360 --> 53:49.720
Mr Jordan!

53:49.720 --> 53:54.280
Admiral Reid. Welcome aboard the SsangYacht.

53:54.280 --> 53:58.440
Mr Jordan! Welcome aboard, sir.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.360
Can I offer you a drink?

54:00.360 --> 54:02.400
- Gin and tonic, I think.
- Gin and tonic?

54:02.400 --> 54:05.240
- Gin and tonic it is.
- I'm very sceptical about all this.

54:05.240 --> 54:07.240
You're sceptical? How sceptical?

54:07.240 --> 54:09.960
- Very sceptical.
- Very sceptical? OK!

54:09.960 --> 54:11.560
There you go.

54:11.560 --> 54:14.640
Now, Eddie, you look like a guy that takes good care of himself.

54:14.640 --> 54:18.160
- You go to the spa sometimes?
- Sometimes.
- Check this out.

54:18.160 --> 54:19.560
Are you ready?

54:19.560 --> 54:22.760
What we have here is special goldfish that we are trying

54:22.760 --> 54:25.040
to train to eat the dead skin off your feet.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.240
So, drop your tootsies right in there and feel the love happening.

54:28.240 --> 54:29.760
You feel them?

54:29.760 --> 54:31.840
- Are you guys for real?
- Yeah.

54:31.840 --> 54:34.920
'Sensing the onboard spa wasn't doing the trick,

54:34.920 --> 54:37.720
'Rory made a panic move.'

54:37.720 --> 54:42.000
HE PLAYS THE EASTENDERS THEME BADLY

54:42.000 --> 54:43.960
'And with that not working either...'

54:43.960 --> 54:45.200
Really?

54:45.200 --> 54:47.600
'..I quickly moved on to the as yet unexplored...'

54:47.600 --> 54:49.880
Keep crawling, keep crawling, keep crawling.

54:49.880 --> 54:51.240
'..master suite.'

54:51.240 --> 54:52.800
Look at this!

54:52.800 --> 54:55.520
Is this spacious, or what? Huh?

54:55.520 --> 54:58.360
I think it's going really well. I think he really likes it.

54:58.360 --> 55:00.480
- You really think he likes it?
- He loves it.

55:00.480 --> 55:05.240
He just had his feet chewed by a recalcitrant goldfish!

55:07.280 --> 55:09.360
There's your toilet. Right there.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.680
Is that nice, or what?

55:12.080 --> 55:13.800
I am confused.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.880
And then, this red button, do you see this?

55:15.880 --> 55:18.880
- Yeah.
- This red button...
- Yeah?

55:18.880 --> 55:23.080
..ejects the waste, the sewage, away from the boat,

55:23.080 --> 55:25.720
so you're not snorkelling through it.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.080
There's no cigar fish in your life.

55:28.080 --> 55:31.400
- Give it a try.
- What, hit that?
- Yeah, hit the button.

55:31.400 --> 55:34.160
It's like a cannon - a torpoodo!

55:34.160 --> 55:36.920
HATCH WHIRS

55:42.480 --> 55:43.640
GURGLING

55:43.640 --> 55:45.480
Oh! Must have been one in the chamber.

55:45.480 --> 55:46.800
Rory, where are your manners?

55:46.800 --> 55:47.920
Sorry!

55:47.920 --> 55:49.880
I mean, lads, please...

55:49.880 --> 55:51.720
You are having a laugh.

55:51.720 --> 55:53.200
What do you mean?

55:53.200 --> 55:56.280
I mean, you can't possibly say that that's correct or proper.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.360
Are you proud of it?

55:59.360 --> 56:02.040
Very. Are you proud of me?

56:02.040 --> 56:03.640
No.

56:03.640 --> 56:06.800
- Come on.
- How could I be?
- We took a minivan...
- It's crap!

56:06.800 --> 56:09.640
But we took a minivan and turned it into a yacht!

56:09.640 --> 56:12.000
But only a lunatic would do such a thing.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.200
'Eddie had seen enough,

56:15.200 --> 56:18.600

56:31.520 --> 56:33.520
Portofino? Capri?

56:33.520 --> 56:35.680
- Miami.
- Oh, nice!

56:35.680 --> 56:39.240
- Yeah!
- Can you just drop me off over there before you do that?

56:39.240 --> 56:40.840
Oh, come on.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.760
I don't want to go any further.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.240

57:03.280 --> 57:05.280
We built...

57:05.280 --> 57:08.480
- We built a beautiful boat...
- Yeah.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.480
- Nobody drowned.
- Nobody drowned.

57:10.480 --> 57:12.960
- And we've removed a Rodius from the road.
- Yup.

57:12.960 --> 57:17.040
And...and the torpoodo stopped doing that thing where it backfired.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.200
That...was very...upsetting.

57:20.200 --> 57:25.480
OK, OK, time for the big moment, because I have here the very first

57:25.480 --> 57:31.000
SsangYacht review by Mr Eddie Jordan in Boat International magazine.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.120
Honestly, this is completely genuine,

57:33.120 --> 57:37.720
you can buy this right now from any good...boat newsagent.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.840
- Come on, come on, what does it say? Show me, show, me.
- OK, OK, OK.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.200
Right here, let's see...

57:43.200 --> 57:46.640
All right, what have we got, what have we got? Um...

57:46.640 --> 57:48.120
"Top-heavy...

57:48.120 --> 57:49.840
"Awkward...

57:49.840 --> 57:53.520
"Minefield of pointy corners..."

57:53.520 --> 57:55.600
No, no, no...

57:55.600 --> 57:59.440
"The worst thing to happen to boating since that iceberg."

58:02.160 --> 58:04.120
OK, OK, here we go. In conclusion...

58:04.120 --> 58:05.760
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

58:05.760 --> 58:11.880
Uh, "It is quite simply the worst boat I have ever been on."

58:14.560 --> 58:16.520
How great is that?

58:16.520 --> 58:19.200
What... What are you talking about? It's a terrible review!

58:19.200 --> 58:21.440
Yeah, but it's a review.

58:21.440 --> 58:27.200
Boat International magazine deemed our little boat worthy of a review.

58:27.200 --> 58:29.240
I mean, yeah, sure, they kicked us,

58:29.240 --> 58:33.240
but they kicked us over six very glossy pages.

58:33.240 --> 58:37.240
I mean, feel that. That is good stuff! Feel that.

58:37.240 --> 58:38.680
Yeah, that is good.

58:38.680 --> 58:41.360
And it's not every day you get the chance to be utterly trashed

58:41.360 --> 58:47.840
- right next to an advert for statue repair services.
- Yes, exactly!

58:47.840 --> 58:52.720
- We have arrived. Well done, Captain Reid.
- Admiral.
- Admiral Reid.

58:52.720 --> 58:55.080
- Well done, Seaman Harris.
- Thank you.

58:55.080 --> 58:57.440
RORY SNIGGERS

58:57.440 --> 59:00.000
And that is the end of the series.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.880
Thank you all so much for watching.

59:01.880 --> 59:04.120
Have a great summer and we'll see you soon.

59:04.120 --> 59:05.960
- ALL:
- Good night!
