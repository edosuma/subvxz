Maya:
<i>Here's what happened</i>
<i>on </i> girl meets world.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.272
Brother and sister?

00:07.274 --> 00:09.541
Riley and I are
brother and sister now?

00:09.543 --> 00:11.143
What does that even mean?

00:11.145 --> 00:12.978
Maya likes you.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.279
Look, if I had
feelings for you,

00:14.281 --> 00:15.948
Don't you think I'd
just come right out and say it?

00:15.950 --> 00:18.250
Well, I don't.
So what I do say is har-har--

00:23.691 --> 00:25.657
Maya:
Riley, I have to
tell you something.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.726
-Riley: I don't want to know.
-(school bell rings)

00:29.130 --> 00:31.397
-Riles, something happened.
-I don't need to know
what happened.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.231
No, I need to tell you.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.465
You need to know.

00:33.467 --> 00:37.369
Maya, I know
a lot of things
are going to happen.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.239
You know what else I know?

00:40.241 --> 00:44.376
I liked the new boy
and you stepped back for me...

00:44.378 --> 00:47.546
And then I saw
how scared you were for him.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.216
You need to feel
whatever you feel.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.318
How could I ever
keep that from you?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.220
Whatever happens, happens.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.426
My brother!

01:00.428 --> 01:02.327
Hey! Hi.
Hey, riley.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.495
You know, um...

01:03.497 --> 01:05.364
I want to thank you again
for believing in me

01:05.366 --> 01:07.399
And giving me the confidence
that I would be okay.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.368
I will always believe in you.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.437
And I will always be here.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.405
Thank you, riley.

Hey.

Hey.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.113
Hi.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.283
Wow.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.554
Hey, riley.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.755
Hi, charlie.

-Charlie gardner!
-Stop it.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.858
Cheese souffle!

01:32.860 --> 01:34.760
Maya, we just got back.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.028
What could he possibly know?

01:36.030 --> 01:37.863
Who could have
possibly said anything?

01:41.368 --> 01:43.302
He made me.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.770
How did he make you?

01:44.772 --> 01:47.473
I was like,
"you wanna hear
a great riley story?"

01:47.475 --> 01:49.475
He said, "yes."

01:49.477 --> 01:51.977
I heard you and lucas
are just gonna be friends.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.379
Yeah, actually,
what we're doing is--

01:54.381 --> 01:55.547
I heard you're free.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.783

-I don't want this.
-We're confused.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.878
-I don't want this either.
-We're going into high school.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.513
Do you know what
your priority is
in high school?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.315
-High school.
-It's where you further

03:03.317 --> 03:05.384
-Your minds and you get
an education.
-You know why?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.286
So that you're smart enough
to not find yourself

03:07.288 --> 03:08.387
In a situation like this.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.521
We're not in a situation.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.490
-Everything's fine.
-Maya?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.724
We're in a situation.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.393
Why do we have to
have feelings?

03:14.395 --> 03:16.528
You don't.
Get rid of 'em.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.197
You think you like lucas?

03:18.199 --> 03:19.531
How can you not like him?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.832
I didn't think
you liked anybody.

03:20.834 --> 03:21.967
It's my facade.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.402
Don't use big words correctly.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.903
It's not who ya are.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.506
-We're riley and maya.
-We know our priorities...

03:27.508 --> 03:30.375
And nothin' and nobody could
ever come between us.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.345
You are two confused kids
who think you know
what you're doing.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.580
But you don't.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.681
So, don't do anything.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.549
Nothing is as easy
as it seems

03:37.551 --> 03:38.383
When feelings are involved.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.219
Mom, it is easy.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.187
Lucas is like my brother and...

03:42.189 --> 03:43.589
I want maya to be happy.

03:43.591 --> 03:47.159
You think being the master
of tombstone the bull is hard?

03:47.161 --> 03:48.594
That is nothing compared

03:48.596 --> 03:50.495
To being the master
of your feelings, riley.

03:50.497 --> 03:53.899
They will shake you around
and they will send you flying.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.735
Sometimes you hold on
and sometimes you let go.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.004
It's the scariest
ride there is.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.941
Well, what do
you want us to do?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.576
Don't feel.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.211
I want you not to feel.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.779
Do they have to go
to high school?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.848
No! I have the power.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.283
I can hold them back.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.751
Dad, you can't hold us back.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.019
We're growing up.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.688
Can I hold them back?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.257
No.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.625
Can anything hold them back?

04:19.627 --> 04:20.926
No.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.262
Are you okay, riley?

04:24.698 --> 04:27.299
I'm going to need
to figure that out.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.433
Are you okay?

04:28.435 --> 04:30.435
I'm gonna need
to let her figure that out.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.970
Oh, no...

04:31.972 --> 04:33.572
They're gonna figure it out.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.606
What do we do?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.376
We trust them.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.015
That's the worst idea
I've ever heard.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.759
The hoover dam
on the arizona/nevada border

04:53.761 --> 04:57.663
Holds back ten trillion gallons
of confused 14-year-old feelings

04:57.665 --> 04:59.498
That look to smack down
the concrete structure

04:59.500 --> 05:00.999
Of your life
and my life,

05:01.001 --> 05:02.567
And it can't take it
and I don't want it,

05:02.569 --> 05:04.836
So everybody sit here
and nobody move!

05:07.608 --> 05:09.675
Because as strong
as the structural integrity

05:09.677 --> 05:10.976
Of the hoover dam might be,

05:10.978 --> 05:13.011
Just one little,
tiny drop of water

05:13.013 --> 05:14.613
That makes its way
through this barrier

05:14.615 --> 05:16.815
Will chip away
at the structural integrity

05:16.817 --> 05:18.517
Of our lives
as we know them,

05:18.519 --> 05:20.018
And the immediate result
is the end

05:20.020 --> 05:22.087
Of my personal happiness!

05:22.089 --> 05:23.822
So, your assignment

05:23.824 --> 05:27.159
Is to hold everything back
until I die

05:27.161 --> 05:29.261
And not let anything through!

05:35.135 --> 05:37.035
Riley, what's that?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.104
Nothing.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.772
Riley...

05:40.774 --> 05:42.574
Did something get through?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.712
Riley, something happened
between me and lucas.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.182
Oh, boy.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.290
Yes, charlie.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.725
I will go out with you.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.695
Hoover dam.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.639
Isn't it amazing

06:14.641 --> 06:16.708
How comfortable we are
with each other?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.244
No!

06:19.246 --> 06:21.980
I don't feel
comfortable at all.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.383
This is the kind of thing
that we could never do,

06:24.385 --> 06:25.917
Lucas, when we were just...

06:25.919 --> 06:27.486
"hi."
"howdy."

06:27.488 --> 06:28.754
"hey."
"hi."

06:28.756 --> 06:30.389
Now you know
what we are? Poom!

06:30.391 --> 06:32.657
Could you maybe
not hit me anymore?

06:32.659 --> 06:34.893
You're my brother.
Be my brother.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.661
Give me advice,
feel good about it,

06:36.663 --> 06:38.764
And nothing will ever
be uncomfortable at all.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.333
Okay, let's try.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.701
What do you need
advice on--

06:42.703 --> 06:44.202
The charlie gardner
of it all.

06:44.204 --> 06:47.005
What does a first date mean
in the language of "boy"?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.507
I want to break your code.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.175
What does he want?
Tell me! What?

06:50.177 --> 06:52.778
Yeah... Charlie gardner.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.713
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.448
Where is your dad?

06:56.450 --> 06:57.582
Why isn't he kicking me out?

06:57.584 --> 07:00.285
I'm in your daughter's room!

07:00.287 --> 07:02.354
Yeah, I see ya!

07:02.356 --> 07:04.689
You sure this isn't
just so he gets to sit there

07:04.691 --> 07:06.558
And be there
with her like that?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.927
No, this is real.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.762
Why do you need
another brother?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.697
I'm just trying
to do everything best

07:12.699 --> 07:14.966
For everybody concerned.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.268
I'm concerned.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.644
Matthews, we know
that everything you teach

07:25.646 --> 07:27.779
Is always about us,
but this is just lazy!

07:27.781 --> 07:29.080
I don't have the time!

07:29.082 --> 07:30.248
I'm going right for it!

07:30.250 --> 07:31.483
You don't think
I could mash this up

07:31.485 --> 07:32.784
With the end
of world war ii
if I wanted to?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.320
America loves russia!

07:35.322 --> 07:36.455
Then america doesn't
love russia!

07:36.457 --> 07:37.589
Japan loves France now!

07:37.591 --> 07:38.890
Japan asks France
to go bowling!

07:38.892 --> 07:40.292
So they go
on a couple of dates,

07:40.294 --> 07:41.660
But then
japan says to France,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.795
"I just want to be friends."

07:43.797 --> 07:46.565
So France says,
"I got enough friends."

07:46.567 --> 07:48.500
So they try to be civil
with each other,

07:48.501 --> 07:50.434
But there's a certain chill
while they're hanging out
by the lockers.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.503
There's a chill!

07:52.639 --> 07:54.673
You don't think everyone
in this room is going bowling

07:54.675 --> 07:55.841
With everybody else
at some point?

07:55.843 --> 07:58.643
Riley, maya, and lucas
is all about everybody

07:58.645 --> 08:00.011
In this room,
in every room,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.180
In the whole world,
and the universe!

08:02.182 --> 08:03.615
They just got there first!

08:03.617 --> 08:05.784
The jerks!

08:05.786 --> 08:06.751
Dad!

08:06.753 --> 08:08.086
You're going to high school.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.989
You are growing up
in spite of my wishes.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.457
It's real now.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.125
What's happened already
is nothing compared

08:14.127 --> 08:15.427
To what's gonna
happen to you now.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.662
I just don't want
anything bad to happen to you.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.031
Don't let anything bad
happen to you!

08:22.870 --> 08:24.135
The class isn't over yet, sir.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.504
Nah, I've had it.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.046
Hey, you wanted to see me?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.548
Sit down.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.854
This chair? All right.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.256
Okay.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.298
Riley has one brother
in her life,

08:53.300 --> 08:54.733
And it isn't you.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.902
-Oh, auggie, I don't--
-did I finish speaking?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.703
No, sir. I just
don't see how

08:58.705 --> 09:00.805
You could possibly
understand relationships

09:00.807 --> 09:02.674
Or anything
that happens to us.

09:02.676 --> 09:06.411
I've been married
to ava morgenstern
for 52 years.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.747
It changes a man.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.814
Kill me.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.084
Riley's my sister.

09:13.086 --> 09:17.088
I'm her only brother.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.524
And her only brother
is telling you

09:19.526 --> 09:23.929
Whatever happens,
don't hurt my sister.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.065
Now get out of my room.
I'm doing my podcast.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.072
Yeah, that's right.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.273
I'm callin' farkle time.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.408
You know why?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.176
Because every time
it's farkle time,

09:38.178 --> 09:39.210
We learn somethin'.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.845
And I need
to learn somethin'.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.582
Because you were in texas
and I wasn't.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.783
Yes, I was, sir.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.885
And would you agree
that somethin' happened

09:46.887 --> 09:49.220
In texas
that's changing everything?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.288
Yes, sir.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.356
Do you know
what it is

09:51.358 --> 09:52.857
And do you know
how to fix it?

09:52.859 --> 09:54.893
-No, sir.
-Why not?

09:54.895 --> 09:56.628
Because I'm a scientist, sir.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.862
This is all about feelings.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.898
Feelings that are new
and hard to describe.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.601
Look, I'm a genius,
but when isadora smackle looks

10:02.603 --> 10:03.702
In my eyes
with that beautiful,

10:03.704 --> 10:05.403
Goofy face of hers,
I get a feeling

10:05.405 --> 10:08.139
Which I can only describe
as bloylahhlahlowww!

10:11.111 --> 10:12.243
You feel me?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.813
Yeah, I feel you, farkle.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.982
Listen...

10:16.984 --> 10:19.117
You are farkle.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.621
These people have always
been important to you.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.423
I need you to figure out
what's going on

10:25.425 --> 10:27.592
With the three of them
and make everything better.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.994
I'm on it, sir.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.428
I like us
just the way we are.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.330
I don't want anything
to change either.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.832
Good.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.668
Because I have no idea
what's gonna happen next.

10:46.947 --> 10:47.812
So? (chuckles)

10:47.814 --> 10:48.913
So... (chuckles)

10:48.915 --> 10:49.948
What?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.984
So, where are we going
on the date?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.153
Do you want to go bowling
like japan and France?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.989
-Sure.
-Or maybe we just
have dinner and talk?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.592
-No talking.
-What?

11:00.594 --> 11:02.460
I just mean
that we don't have to talk.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.629
-Oh. Then do you want
to go to the movies?
-Perfect.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.830
The movies are perfect.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.533
We can just sit there.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.002
You're not gonna try
and hold my hand, are you?

11:11.004 --> 11:14.806
Uh, hey, I just found out
that we're going to the movies.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.975
I had bowling planned,
but that's out the window.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.444
Okay. Well, I'm looking
forward to our date.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.712
Me too.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.514
No talking,
no holding hands.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.682
Yay.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.359
Huh.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.560
Huh.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.708
So this is our
new relationship?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.377
Yeah.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.080
How's it going so far?

11:55.082 --> 11:57.148
Weird, man.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.850
You don't have to watch.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.385
I can't look away!

12:01.922 --> 12:03.021
How's it goin'?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.222
Look at 'em!

12:04.224 --> 12:06.524
Farkle:
You think
hey like each other?

12:06.526 --> 12:07.926
I do.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.160
But I think they liked
each other better

12:09.162 --> 12:11.529
When she was yelling
at him all the time.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.431
What about riley and lucas?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.934
Well, I only knew lucas
before I came here,

12:15.936 --> 12:18.737
But then I met riley,
and she's just like him.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.004
How?

12:20.006 --> 12:21.406
Well, the thing
we all knew about lucas

12:21.408 --> 12:23.341
Is lucas would do anything
for his friends.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.710
And I never thought there could
be anybody else like that,

12:25.712 --> 12:27.045
But riley is.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.347
So you think they are
like brother and sister?

12:29.349 --> 12:31.750
No, I just think
they have a lot in common.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.552
I mean, riley would do
anything for her friends, too.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.920
Yeah.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.957
And I think she did.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.560
So... What are you thinkin'?

12:42.562 --> 12:45.096
Oh, now?
Oh, it's so funny
you mention that.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.431
Actually, right now,
in this exact moment,

12:46.433 --> 12:47.799
What I was thinking,
what was running

12:47.801 --> 12:49.601
Through my head was actually,
if you don't start

12:49.603 --> 12:51.803
Talking to me,
I'm gonna pour this smoothie
right over your head.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.204
So, why don't you give me
the best you got?

13:01.748 --> 13:04.716
Did I ever tell you once,
I delivered a baby horse?

13:18.565 --> 13:21.032
Actually, it looked
kind of like this.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.668
The miracle of life.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.177
-Mom?
-Honey?

13:33.346 --> 13:36.247
I'm going on a date
with charlie gardner

13:36.249 --> 13:39.484
And maya is going out
with lucas.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.787
What do you do
when you think

13:42.788 --> 13:44.488
You're doing what's right,
but you're really just confused

13:44.491 --> 13:46.024
And you feel like
life is trying

13:46.026 --> 13:47.992
To throw you
on the ground?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.527
You hang on, riley.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.100
I'm a little tired.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.169
Please don't go anywhere.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.904
I won't.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.374
I'm gonna be here
a long time.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.110
Okay.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.727
(grunts)

14:22.729 --> 14:24.028
Honey?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.563
Sweetie?

14:25.565 --> 14:29.200
Um, I love you
and I love your teen angst,

14:29.202 --> 14:31.603
But I have to go to work
so that I can afford you.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.572
Oh, thank goodness.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.307
(grunts)

14:36.309 --> 14:38.543
Okay, she's all yours.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.144
She drools a little.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.150
Go to school.
Brush your teeth.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.052
-Comb your hair.
-Mmm.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.889
-You're not my mother.
-No, it's me.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.192
(both laugh nervously)

14:54.194 --> 14:55.927
How did you time
with lucas go?

14:55.929 --> 14:59.898
It-- we sat there
with absolutely
nothing to say.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.233
-Been there, done that.
-Yeah, well...

15:02.235 --> 15:03.868
You guys won't have to worry
about that anymore

15:03.870 --> 15:05.603
-Now that you're brother
and sister, you know.
-Mm-hmm.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.505
You guys have loads
to-- to talk about.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.740
I love talking to him.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.441
I love making fun of him.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.576
Why?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.745
-Why do I love
to make fun of him?
-Yeah.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.114
Because he's great.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.248
Yeah.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.386
And he needs someone
like me to take him down.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.188
-And he needs
someone like you--
-for why?

15:24.190 --> 15:25.690
For why
does he need me?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.393
To build him up,

15:28.395 --> 15:30.261
To tell his
ranger rick stories to,

15:30.263 --> 15:33.598
-And make him feel like a hero.
-(both laugh)

15:33.600 --> 15:37.101
You like his stories
and-- and he likes yours.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.805
Yeah.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.418
-Hi, riley.
-Hi, charlie.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.920
-Riley, I can't be
your brother anymore.
-Hey, friar.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.122
Do you think you can
pick a better time
for this big announcement?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.390
Riley and I are
gonna go on a date.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.491
You are?

16:01.561 --> 16:02.627
No holding hands
or talking.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.995
Best date ever.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.964
I know it's not,
but it's what I got.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.066
Those are the rules?

16:08.068 --> 16:10.501
Who goes on a date
and doesn't talk
to each other?

16:14.407 --> 16:15.673
Oh, yeah. We do.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.975
Hi.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.042
Hello.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.279
Hey riley,
can we go?

16:21.281 --> 16:22.347
I like to be there

16:22.349 --> 16:23.614
For the previews
of coming attractions.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.183
When I'm not there
for the previews

16:25.185 --> 16:27.518
Of coming attractions,
I feel like I didn't
see the whole movie.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.753
Hey riley,
what do you do

16:28.755 --> 16:29.921
When you sit
next to huckleberry?

16:29.923 --> 16:31.856
Maya, I can't give
you advice like that.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.858
Sure you can.
You're his sister, right?

16:33.860 --> 16:35.326
Nope. Not anymore.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.195
-Why?
-Auggie says we can't.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.663
-Hey, friar--
-and you know what?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.431
I think he's right.
You already have
a great brother.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.300
Hey, friar!

16:42.302 --> 16:43.935
Then what will you be?

16:43.937 --> 16:46.404
He'll be me,
because it's me now.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.975
Yeah. Sorry.
You have every right.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.178
I also want to be there
early to get snacks

16:54.180 --> 16:56.447
'cause if we're not talking
or holding hands,

16:56.449 --> 16:58.883
I was gonna buy
some popcorn and licorice.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.318
You mean popcorn
and chocolate.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.286
-I'm not you!
-Okay!

17:02.288 --> 17:04.322
Anyway, auggie loves you, riley.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.391
So, I'm gonna step back
from being your brother.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.192
-Say "me now."
-me now.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.694
You have every right.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.064
I break the licorice
into little pieces

17:13.066 --> 17:14.866
So every time I take
a handful of popcorn,

17:14.868 --> 17:16.100
I get a surprise.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.337
I'm adorable.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.738
How are you not seeing this?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.240
Zay:
You see?

17:22.242 --> 17:24.375
Lucas does anything
for anybody.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.010
I mean, he sacrifices
being riley's brother

17:26.012 --> 17:27.211
So he doesn't
hurt auggie's feelings.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.846
Well, same with riley.
She's stepping back

17:28.848 --> 17:30.681
From lucas because she's
doing exactly the same thing.

17:30.683 --> 17:34.218
-Farkle, stop.
-But I thought she didn't
like him like that anymore.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.621
No, riley's stepping back
from lucas because she doesn't--

17:38.425 --> 17:40.992
Okay, she ends up
with farkle.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.260
How did we not see
that coming?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.897
Farkle, you don't know
what's going on.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.032
-Stop thinking.
-I know auggie's right.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.200
He's your only brother.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.535
I've seen the way
you look at auggie,

17:50.537 --> 17:52.036
And I've seen the way
you look at lucas.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.337
It's not the same.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.373
I-- I think I know
my own feelings.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.941
-You're a liar.
-Farkle.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.109
You're lying to yourself.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.244
Lucas and I don't
make a good couple.

18:04.017 --> 18:05.383
Thank you very much, lucas.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.318
I had a wonderful time.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.254
You're welcome, riley.
I also had

18:10.256 --> 18:11.789
A wonderful time as well.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.295
You were both just nervous
because that's not who you are.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.397
I guess the thing
I miss most about texas

18:19.399 --> 18:20.798
Are the pets
that I used to have.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.367
I had a hamster.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.103
I had 24 horses.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.504
You win.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.475
Tell me about them.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.043
Okay, okay.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.611
But what about maya?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.280
Huh-hurr.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.449
Har-har!

18:38.451 --> 18:42.620
Huh-hurr!

18:45.458 --> 18:48.426
I'm not really sure
how maya feels.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.794
You're not sure?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.829
How can you not be sure?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.431
This isn't about her.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.366
I'm talking
about how you feel.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.941
Farkle, how do you
even know about that?

19:03.943 --> 19:06.010
-You weren't even there.
-Doesn't matter.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.412
What you're thinking
is how you really feel.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.516
I don't care.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.918
Farkle, maya is my best friend.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.420
She cares about him
and he cares about her too.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.095
You questioning
my leadership, hop-along?

19:24.097 --> 19:25.930
Okay, these names
you're calling me are

19:25.932 --> 19:27.165
Killing my street cred.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.534
You actually put thought
into our little game, don't you?

19:29.536 --> 19:31.536
I actually do.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.371
(shudders)

19:33.373 --> 19:35.373
Oh, no.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.945
Hello.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.381
I'm bucky mcboing boing.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.117
I want maya to be happy.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.720
Hey, maya, it looks like
lucas here's gettin' all

19:49.722 --> 19:51.355
Fired up on your behalf.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.558
Thank you, lucas.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.692
But it's just an art class.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.993
I feel bad.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.628
They're taking away
something you're very good at.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.364
-You've never said
that to me before.
-I have said it.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.567
Yeah, but not, like,
right to my face
when you were looking at me.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.303
-I can't remember you actually--
-you're a great artist, maya.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.241
He might,
but we know he likes you.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.811
What's the matter?

20:21.754 --> 20:23.187
Hi.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.256
Even though
this just happened,

20:25.258 --> 20:28.326
There are some moments
you know you're gonna
remember forever.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.794
This is one of 'em.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.497
(sniffs)

20:40.406 --> 20:41.539
You were the first

20:41.541 --> 20:42.873
Boy I ever liked.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.909
That's big deal for me.
Are you worth it?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.444
Tell me,
and I'll believe you.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.946
I want to believe you.
Are you worth it?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.248
Yes.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.183
(screams)

20:55.221 --> 20:56.454
Hi.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.523
We were just
talking about you.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.729
Hi, I'm riley.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.597
We were just
talking about you.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.766
(chuckles)
I'm lucas.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.134
I love it.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.539
You can't tell anybody.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.452
-I will, unless you do.
-Why?

21:28.454 --> 21:30.054
Because we are growing up.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.555
And I don't know
how to handle

21:31.557 --> 21:33.124
These feelings
we're feeling.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.692
But I do know that
we don't lie to each other.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.628
We don't lie
to each other, riley.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.298
You're right.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.636
This is really hard
and maybe I just
need some time.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.572
I'm always here for you.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.210
I love you, farkle.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.913
And I love you.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.649
Now go on your date.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.554
Ready?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.491
For the previews
of coming attractions?

22:07.493 --> 22:08.693
Yeah.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.761
I'm sure we're all wondering
what happens now.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.616
How was your date?

22:33.653 --> 22:34.885
I don't know.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.254
How was your date?

22:38.324 --> 22:39.557
I don't know.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.532
Do we know anything?

22:54.374 --> 22:55.740
Ring power.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.710
Ring power.

23:01.314 --> 23:02.913
-Thunder.
-Lightning.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.750
A little scared.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.084
Me too.
