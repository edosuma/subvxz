means is that you were born to lose.

The simplest question of all,

just training without logic.

to be made.

No, I don't think it has.
Not that I'm aware of.

Of course, if the drug were taken
in an unregulated fashion

20:29.600 --> 20:33.060
without adequate monitoring,
one can see a certain risk.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.620
But under more controlled circumstances

20:35.720 --> 20:40.900
there could be an increase in VO2 max on
5 millilitres per kilogram per minute.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.820
That should equate to a corresponding
improvement in athletic performance.

28 minutes ahead of me today.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.609
How's that?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.620
WALSH: There is a silence around cycling.

33:49.720 --> 33:53.260
A silence from the administrators,
from the press and from the riders.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.020
It's kind of deafening, really.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.408
But if we just keep on cheering loud
enough maybe it will all go away

33:58.520 --> 34:01.500
and no one will ever hear
the unwelcome question

34:01.600 --> 34:04.080
"Is this real... or is it dope?".

34:05.000 --> 34:07.571
Yeah, I'm gonna go talk to him.

34:16.199 --> 34:20.444
What are you doing? What you're
saying to journalists, it's...

34:20.560 --> 34:22.900
it's not good for cycling.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.100
I'm saying what I think.
There is still doping.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.966
If that's why you're here, maybe you
should just go home and get another job.

34:30.719 --> 34:33.610
If I have things to say, I will say them.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.002
Then fuck you.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.699
Get to the back.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.940
Tell the doctor I have a saddle sore

35:22.040 --> 35:25.340
and I need a script for Cortisone cream.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.408
Pre-date it.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.060
Yeah, everybody's happy.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.367
UCI is an upstanding organisation.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.603
And if they don't like it,
tell them to kiss my saddle sore.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.602
OK. Yeah, let me know.

into second position there.

We're not gonna climb the mountain,

36:08.840 --> 36:11.900
we're gonna roll right through it.

You're gonna ride the best ride of
your life and you're gonna suffer.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.402
COMMENTATOR: Well, this is the move now.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.900
Armstrong has waited long enough,
stripped of all his team-mates

36:21.000 --> 36:24.060
and he's trying to do a Sestriere
in the Pyrenees.

Armstrong, dominates.

36:30.880 --> 36:34.220
The Tour de France
has become the "Tour de Lance".

36:34.320 --> 36:36.300
All eyes are on American Lance Armstrong.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.220
The 27-year-old from Texas
has a commanding lead...

36:39.320 --> 36:43.325

I think it's true to say,

36:55.000 --> 36:56.540
doesn't need EPO to go quick.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.563
Emma, can you get rid of this for me?

36:59.960 --> 37:02.940
This is a team that's had a great
build up to the Tour de France.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.260
They have never been associated
with the word "dope".

37:06.360 --> 37:08.540
They have always ridden well and clean.

37:08.640 --> 37:12.700
And Lance Armstrong now
has shown them all what they can do.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.740

"I can't go any further"

37:17.840 --> 37:20.980

At speeds of80kph,
Zülle is a nervous descender

37:27.360 --> 37:29.100
but Lance Armstrong clearly is not.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.260
Emma, can you cover this up?

37:32.360 --> 37:35.125
That's about as good as it's gonna get.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.580

37:37.680 --> 37:40.260
Lance Armstrong had a visit
early this morning

37:40.360 --> 37:42.100
by what the riders call the vampires.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.500
That's the Medical Control Unit
of the International Cycling Union.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.843
They all had their blood tested
for the possible use of EPO.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.364
Lance.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.260
Come on, squeeze it.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.900
Epo is undetectable.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.260
Good for us, but not the UCI.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.140
They test the haematocrit instead.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.100
How much of your blood is cells,
how much is water.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.044

39:37.840 --> 39:40.411
came on bicycles
and pedalled down Congress A venue

39:40.520 --> 39:43.700
to pay tribute to the most famous
bicyclist in the world.

39:43.800 --> 39:48.044
Well, he overcame cancer, and
I've had cancer, so I can appreciate it.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.260
Cancer...

39:50.360 --> 39:52.700
it's a brutal experience.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.820
But you meet yourself along the way.

39:54.920 --> 39:59.100
I approached my disease the same way
that I'd approach a race.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.620
There's an enemy to be defeated.

40:01.720 --> 40:05.900
I recall one time in the hospital,
the third cycle of chemo,

40:06.000 --> 40:11.260
very weak, making my way down
an endless hallway

40:11.360 --> 40:13.500
and a nurse comes up to me
with a wheelchair.

40:13.600 --> 40:17.260
She said, "Mr Armstrong,
would you care to sit down?"

40:17.360 --> 40:21.700
And I said, "Thanks, but no thanks."

40:21.800 --> 40:24.100
"I'm gonna walk."

40:24.200 --> 40:28.700
And I did.
I didn't give up because it's worth it.

40:28.800 --> 40:33.900

powerful than any drug on the planet.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.610
Oh, just your name. Thanks.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.290
I gave up.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.886
I turned my face to the wall to die.

44:09.360 --> 44:12.842
But you made me live, Lance Armstrong.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.368
And that's who you are.

The Olympic Games, Seoul, 1988.
He tested positive for Stanozolol.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.411
I remember.

44:47.520 --> 44:51.740
Michelle Smith, Atlanta '96. Accused
of tampering with a urine sample.

44:51.840 --> 44:55.020
Every heroic athlete you cover
is gonna crumble into dust.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.900
And the next name you're gonna mention
is Lance Armstrong.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.900
- You're a clever sausage.
- I knew it.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.540
- Everybody thinks I'm mad!
- Not everybody. But, yes.

45:02.640 --> 45:04.900
And why is that?
Let's take that question first.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.100
Is it because Lance Armstrong,
handsome young cancer survivor,

45:09.200 --> 45:12.180
the inspirer of millions,
cannot possibly be a cheat

45:12.280 --> 45:15.220
because that would reveal the world
to be a great pile of shit?

45:15.320 --> 45:17.100
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

45:17.200 --> 45:21.700
David, do you have any substantial
information to back up your story?

45:21.800 --> 45:23.500
Like they do in proper journalism.

45:23.600 --> 45:29.500
Yes, I do have some substantial
information. Michele Ferrari.

45:29.600 --> 45:33.020
He is the godfather of blood doping.

45:33.120 --> 45:36.500
The Italian cops have taken Ferrari

45:36.600 --> 45:39.620
because of some financial irregularities.

45:39.720 --> 45:43.860
- They seized his diary from '97.
- And Lance is in it?

45:43.960 --> 45:46.300
- No.
- David.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.820
One of his team-mates is in it.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.729
And two years later...

45:50.600 --> 45:52.820
Lance takes a little trip to Ferrari.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.700
He stays here at
the Hotel Duchessa Isabella.

45:55.800 --> 46:00.500
From there to the residence of Michele
Ferrari is less than ten minutes walk.

46:00.600 --> 46:04.685
"Armstrong visits Pope of dope."
How did you find this out?

46:06.160 --> 46:07.620
Friend of a friend.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.820
- David.
- So I sent Lance a very polite letter.

46:10.920 --> 46:14.527
And lo and behold...
he accepts my invitation.

46:18.880 --> 46:19.860
Hi.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.260
David.

46:21.360 --> 46:25.001
Hi, Lance. Thanks for coming. So...

46:26.000 --> 46:27.365
Let me just...

46:31.200 --> 46:34.820
Dr Ferrari made a statement about EPO.
Do you remember that?

46:34.920 --> 46:38.700
- No.
- Did you ever visit Michele Ferrari?

46:38.800 --> 46:41.060
- I did know him.
- How did you know him?

46:41.160 --> 46:46.740
In cycling you go to races, there are
lots of people. A small community.

46:46.840 --> 46:48.410
Did you ever visit him?

46:48.520 --> 46:50.180
Did I get tested by him,

46:50.280 --> 46:53.500
did I go there
and get consulted on certain things?

46:53.600 --> 46:56.046
- Perhaps.
- So you did?

47:02.520 --> 47:05.700
The tape recorder won't pick up
your body language

47:05.800 --> 47:07.609
so can I get a yes or a no on that?

47:09.200 --> 47:11.100
Perhaps.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.567
He's about to be tried
for criminal conspiracy.

47:18.880 --> 47:24.100
I think the judges and the prosecutors
should pursue everybody,

47:24.200 --> 47:28.649
no matter who they are,
because that's their job.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.180
So, he's evasive.

47:33.280 --> 47:36.409
What does it all add up to? Nothing.

47:36.520 --> 47:40.260
You got nothing, David.
No evidence I can actually publish.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.900
Alex, we can't censor this.
It's too important.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.140
The fact is, the law may take a view

47:45.240 --> 47:49.500
that even asking a question about
him doping is to make an allegation.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.700
And I'm not sure
we're able to support that.

47:51.800 --> 47:55.060
If you shy away from this, you should
get somebody else to do my job

47:55.160 --> 47:57.260
because as much as I like the Tour

47:57.360 --> 48:01.206
I have no interest in going up a
mountain to watch chemists compete!

48:03.320 --> 48:06.210
Feel free to come back
when you've got some evidence, David.

48:08.600 --> 48:11.820
So you must know
that Tyler Hamilton has left the team

48:11.920 --> 48:14.082
and that we're looking for a replacement.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.100
You're a terrific cyclist, Floyd,

48:19.200 --> 48:21.601
and Lance wants you on US Postal.

48:23.640 --> 48:25.085

(LINE RINGING)

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.860
BETSY: Hello?

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.660
Erm, Betsy Andreu?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.860
Speaking.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.860
Hi, my name is David Walsh.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.440
You're the guy who writes about Lance?

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.860
Well, I write about other things, too.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.660
- But Lance, right?
- Yeah, Lance.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.091
OK.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.980
I was there.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.060
WALSH: You were where?

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.340
In the room.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.300
In what room?

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.006
The hospital room. Come on. Speed up.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.860
So, October '96, Lance is in the hospital.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.646
I guess he's starting to get better,
but he's still pretty ill.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.445
Frankie and I drop in to visit.
This doctor comes in.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.450
Excuse me. Mr Armstrong,
I was reviewing your records.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.020
Could I clarify a couple of issues
in your history?

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.500
We offered to leave, but...

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.446
Lance said that he wanted us to
stay. Then this doctor asks him...

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.020
In the past,
you were on no regular medication?

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.060
No.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.449
You ever use any other drugs?
Any performance enhancing drugs?

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.971
Testosterone...

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.403
Epo, growth hormone, cortisone...

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.409
and other steroids.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.540
Tell me that again.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.940
Epo, testosterone, growth hormone,
cortisone and other steroids.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.900
- He said that?
- She says he said that.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.260
- On the record?
- And she's not the only one.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.860
WALSH: Now I started to attract
the dissidents.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.660
Well, there's a culture of doping
in US Postal.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:07.891
I never asked to be involved, but at
times it was impossible to avoid.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.860
And then there was Stephen Swart.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.620
SWART: I was a rider with Motorola
in 1995 and...

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.406
I can tell you that Lance was the
leader in trying to get us to dope.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.060
You love peas, don't you?
Peas are your favourite thing.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.060
Hello?

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.260
- MAN: David Walsh?
- Yeah.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.580
My name is Bob Hamman. You don't know me

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:31.241
but I'd like to talk to you
and I'll pay for your ticket.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.446
I've been playing poker since '55,
bridge since '63, insurance since '86.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.562
All the same game.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.451
At the core of what I do
is making judgement of risk

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.360
in situations where the odds
are essentially complex.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:05.260
Back in 2000, I get a visit from the
owners of the US Postal cycling team.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.260
You may wanna write this down.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.180
As the owners of Tailwind,

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.140
the company that finances
the US Postal cycling team...

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.049
You're the victims of your own success.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.020
I guess you could say that.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.091
This Armstrong guy,
he's a pretty good... cyclist, right?

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.405
He's the best.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.860
And you paid him his bonus
for winning the Tour de France?

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.260
That's right.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.940
What if he keeps on winning?

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.442
Well, obviously,
we'd be delighted if he keeps winning.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.860
How much are you in for?

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.780
If he wins every Tour between now
and 2004, we will owe him nearly...

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.450
10 million dollars.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:49.402
So, the question is, how much would it
cost for me to take on that risk?

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.780
2002, 2003, we paid out.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.980
Then comes 2004... and he goes on winning.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.660
Then we hear about this journalist
making unwelcome enquiries

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.060
and it turns out that perhaps
all is not what it seemed.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.371
You see, if he's cheating in the races,
then he's cheating on us as well.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.779
And if he didn't really win,
they don't really owe him the money.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.620
Exactly! Well done, Alex.
You've finally caught up.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.660
But let us not forget this.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.162
Lance Armstrong has never tested positive.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.859
Can you imagine how disastrous
it would be if he did?

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.620
- He wouldn't like it.
- Nobody would.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.700
Lance is very respectful
of the governing body.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.060
So supportive, in fact, that sometimes
he even gives them money.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.260
- And here it is.
- What is that?

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:45.060
This is what they bought
with Lance's money.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.448
It's a compact high-performance
haematology analyser

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.819
that provides precise
and accurate results.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.859
"Lance Armstrong Fights War On Drugs!"
You gotta admit it's a great headline.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.020
It's a great headline.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.140
WALSH: You realise what we're up against.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.450
Lance Armstrong is a friend of George
Bush, Bill Clinton, Sheryl Crow,

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.020
David Letterman,
Robin Williams and bloody Bono.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.441
That many famous people
can't be wrong, can they?

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.042
OK, write it. We'll put it in front
of the lawyers, take it from there.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.540
LANCE: David Walsh! David fucking Walsh!

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.260
That fucking troll!
Has he ever even been on a bike?

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:29.740
Has he ever climbed a mountain
against 180 guys who are all doping?

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.779
Unfortunately, he's persistent.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.020
Who's he talking to? Emma O'Reilly.
You know what really upsets me?

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.859
It's the disloyalty.
If she wants to dance, let's go.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.260
All I have to say is that
there were issues with other riders.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:46.060
It's not gonna take a brain surgeon
to figure out she's an alcoholic whore.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.859
And if that doesn't shut her up,
hit her with a lawsuit.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.060
And then another one after that.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.449
And then another one after that until
she shuts her fucking whore mouth!

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.260
- And Betsy?
- Don't even talk to me about Betsy!

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.260
I'd leave Frankie alone,
if he had any self-respect.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.660
Get him to put a muzzle
on his crazy bitch wife.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.660
The bigger problem, Lance,
is the Bob Hamman situation.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.411
They're threatening
to withhold your win bonus,

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.260
the entire million bucks,
until they get a clarification.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.443
I have never tested positive!

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:22.441
I spent three weeks in the saddle!
I won the race! I am owed that money!

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.060
How fucking clear is that?!

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.400
I get it, Lance.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.860
Sue David Walsh.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.860
And his crummy little English newspaper.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.300
Find out who he hangs out with,
who he travels with.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.660
Stonewall them. Block them. Zero access.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.500
Call his publisher. Offer him my new book.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.860
A new book?

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.580
Create a conflict of interest. David
Walsh's book is not going to print.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.820
Not in the States. Not in my backyard.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.766
Because I'm Lance Armstrong
and he is fucking no one.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.660
I like this. I like somebody
trying to go faster than me.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.660
I like malignant cells
trying to take over my body.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.446
I like some fool trying to take me down.
Because I go faster.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.962
I don't die
and I will not be brought down.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.610
We know your wife is a source for Walsh.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.251
Look, Betsy said, "No comment."

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.083
I got nothing to say.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.642
Bringing down Lance isn't
gonna help anyone's situation.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.170
Maybe you should remind your wife of that.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.820
Hey, Charles.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.340
How is your little Irish friend?

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.500
What?

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.444
You know, that little fucking troll.
How is he?

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.220
(APPLAUSE)

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.368
(WOMAN INTRODUCES LANCE IN FRENCH)

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.083
Lance. Lance.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.660
Have recent controversial allegations
upset your preparation in any way?

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.900
Well, since the esteemed author
of these allegations is here today,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.860
I'd like to say one thing about them.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.860
Extraordinary allegations must be met
with extraordinary proof.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.406
- But what do you think...
- I'm not finished yet.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.620
Many, many journalists here today
have called me at home.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.060
They've read his work and they've said,
"Lance, I don't get it."

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.820
"There's nothing in there."

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.700
Mr Walsh here, he seems more interested

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:48.126
in distracting from my foundation's
sole purpose which is to beat cancer.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.440
He seems more interested
in trying to sell books

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.060
rather than the 20,000 people
who die every day from this disease.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.500
That's 7.6 million people annually.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.500
Let's let the cyclists get back to cycling

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.700
and let's all pay attention
and refocus on finding a cure

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.260
and saving lives.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.500
Thank you.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.726
(APPLAUSE)

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.540
- David.
- Yeah.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.020
What is it, John?

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.060
What just went on in there...

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:27.610
Look, the thing is, having you with us
is making life difficult.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.722
If you don't let me in the car,
I can't report.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.260
I'm sorry, David.
You know how these things are.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.860
We all drink from the same trough,
and if one of us spits in the soup...

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.500
John... don't you find it odd

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.047
that we're being asked
to drink soup from a trough?

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.020
- Look...
- What?!

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.921
I used to believe in this sport
and Armstrong is killing it!

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.140
Members of the jury,

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.540
you are here to consider a case for libel

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.860
brought by Mr Armstrong against
The Sunday Times newspaper.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.980
MAN: This is not a judicial proceeding,

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.402
this is a court of arbitration
in relation to the claim by Tailwind

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.020
against SCA for payments to Mr Armstrong.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.540
Emma O'Reilly has identified that
at one point in the Tour de France

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.020
that you asked her to dispose
of some syringes.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.900
- Are you familiar with her statement?
- I am familiar with that statement.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.980
- Is there any truth to that statement?
- Absolutely not.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.260
In interview on Irish radio recently,
Mr Walsh,

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.980
you acknowledged that you had
no "smoking gun".

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.860
I meant I had no single piece of evidence

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.820
which of itself rendered
all others unnecessary.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.540
Do you recall
while others were in the room

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.700
that a doctor asked if you'd taken
performance enhancing drugs?

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.020
Absolutely not.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.140
So the hospital room incident
affirmatively did not take place?

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.580
- Correct.
- OK.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.020
How could it have happened?

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.700
And you have never taken them in
connection with your cycling career?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.260
How could it if I've never taken
performance enhancing drugs?

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.260
And that includes any substance
that's ever been banned?

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.900
How many times do I have to say it?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.060
OK. We're just trying
to make things clear.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.540
Nothing but an amalgam of
uncorroborated hearsay and speculation.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.940
Gossip from embittered
former colleagues and employees.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.060
The best tactic is not to slander, defame,

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.300

has confirmed to Mr Armstrong

to accuse him of being guilty

performance enhancing drugs."

the 41-year-old icon is painted as
both a user and a supplier for the team

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.180
of performance enhancing drugs.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.620
He's also described as the leader
of what the USADA calls

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.980
the most sophisticated and
professionalised doping program

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.082
in recent sports history.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.620
Lifetime?

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.563
I got a lifetime ban?

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.540
Bullshit.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.260
I'm gonna help you clean up cycling
and I'm gonna compete again.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.409
I mean, maybe I'll run
in the Chicago marathon

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.410
or I'll just race with my kids in Austin.

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.684
But unless you're coming to me
with this promise, why am I here?

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:53.100
The most sophisticated doping program
in the history of sport.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.440
Really?

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.562
East Germany ring a bell?

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.180
You guys don't hold
the keys to my redemption.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.780
The only person who can do that...

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.980
Me. This guy right here.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.447
And I can clean up the whole sport
without your help

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.722
because you're a bunch of amateurs.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.580
I can't get up in the morning
unless I have something to live for.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.980
That's training, competition.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.620
I'm not training because I enjoy it,

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.340
I'm not training because I wanna stay fit.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:26.081
It's my whole...

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.723
my whole life.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.522
It's what I do.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.044
It's what I do.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:53.285
MAN: That's all for now, Mr Armstrong.
Thank you for your time.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.722
(PHONE RINGS)

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.780
Lance, it's Bill. It's about Nike.

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.340
They thought you ought to know
before they go public.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.780
They wanna stand by you, no question,

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.980
but it's just, I mean,
now's not so good, right?

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:28.900
So, what they're proposing
is a kind of separation,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.180
Which I know sounds
like they're ditching you,

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.500
which in a sense they are.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.100
Their statement will say
that it is with great sadness

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.260
and I think we can take something
from that.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:42.060
But, great sadness that we have
terminated our contract with him

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.369
due to the seemingly
insurmountable evidence.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.446
REPORTER 1: The disgraced cyclist
Lance Armstrong

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.780
is said to be preparing to tell all.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.407
He's chosen a confessional,
Oprah Winfrey's television show.

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:58.140
REPORTER 2: And if the rumours are
true, he'll confess for the first time.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.780
REPORTER 3: Lance Armstrong
may finally be coming clean

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.260
about his use
of performance-enhancing drugs.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.900
OPRAH WINFREY:
Did you ever take banned substances

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.900
to enhance your cycling performance?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.047
Yes.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.260
OPRAH: Yes or no. Was one of those
banned substances EPO?

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.500
LANCE: Yes.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.620
OPRAH: Did you ever blood dope,

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:23.100
or use blood transfusions to enhance
your cycling performance?

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.531
Yes.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.401
OPRAH: Did you ever use any other
banned substances, like testosterone,

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.410
cortisone or human growth hormone?

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.300
Yes.

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:39.300
Yes or no. In all seven of
your Tour de France victories

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:42.660
did you ever take banned substances
or blood dope?

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.886
Yes.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.660
OPRAH: It's an epic story.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:08.446
LANCE: This story was so perfect
for so long.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.580
You win the Tour de France seven times,

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.860
you have a happy marriage,
you have children.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.740
I mean,
it was just this mythic perfect story.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.001
OPRAH: Yes.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:22.525
And it wasn't true.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.042
