00:01.750 --> 00:02.750
[narrator]
Previously onX-Men...

00:04.625 --> 00:06.125
[all] Let's get out of here!

00:06.125 --> 00:07.875
[people screaming]

00:25.875 --> 00:28.375
[screaming]

00:33.458 --> 00:35.625
[people screaming]

00:49.250 --> 00:51.333
You done nice, girlie.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.875
[Wolverine roaring]

00:56.708 --> 00:59.500
Rogue!
Get him to the infirmary. Fast!

02:12.833 --> 02:15.166
-[Rogue] Watch your back,
swamp rat.
-Ahhh!

02:20.416 --> 02:23.416
You're tangling
with the wrong X-Man.

02:24.375 --> 02:25.458
[Jean screams]

02:26.708 --> 02:28.583
[Xavier on PA]
Remember, this isn't a game.

02:29.083 --> 02:33.000
These dangers are patterned
on those X-Men might encounter
in the field.

02:33.416 --> 02:36.125
-Our continued training
is crucial.
-[Jean screams]

02:36.125 --> 02:41.083
As long as mankind fears
our mutant powers,
we are in danger.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.333
Remember what happened
to Morph.

02:43.333 --> 02:44.708
In the days ahead,

02:44.708 --> 02:46.875
we will have to depend
on each other

02:46.875 --> 02:48.291
for our very lives.

02:56.625 --> 02:58.750
Rogue, take out
the wall blasters.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.875
Gambit, disable
the targeting cameras.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.000
[Gambit exclaims]

03:13.583 --> 03:15.708
What're we going
to do now, sugar?

03:15.708 --> 03:19.958
You three, stop the walls.
I shall slow the ceiling.

03:23.458 --> 03:25.458
That sucker's thick.

03:26.708 --> 03:29.000
[thunder rumbles]

03:29.000 --> 03:31.416
[Jubilee] How do you fight
a whole room?

03:31.416 --> 03:33.208
[Storm screaming]

03:35.875 --> 03:37.708
[Storm] Make it stop.

03:39.708 --> 03:41.125
Storm.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.250
Stop!

03:43.291 --> 03:46.000
Make it stop, please.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Make it stop.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.250
-Somebody get to her before...
-[Storm] Please, make it stop.

03:53.250 --> 03:56.958
[X-MEN screaming]

03:57.708 --> 03:58.875
[Jean] Storm.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.708
[Gambit] Storm!

04:04.708 --> 04:07.583
[screaming]

04:12.250 --> 04:14.583
[Jubilee] Storm, are you okay?

04:14.583 --> 04:17.208
You're just saving your
good moves for next time.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.625
I do not desire to lead,
Professor.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.416
My claustrophobia
puts the others at risk.

04:26.416 --> 04:29.708
When the time comes, Storm,
it may not be
a matter of choice.

04:31.208 --> 04:34.375
Wolverine, you're
supposed to be resting.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.375
Even you can't heal this fast.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.291
Don't bet on it, Red.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.166
Sabretooth nearly killed you.

04:41.166 --> 04:43.500
Someday I'll learn
not to let my guard down.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.708
-[Wolverine groaning]
-Oh, no.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.875
Jean...

04:48.875 --> 04:51.625
I've... got to go. Uh...

04:52.625 --> 04:54.458
Cyclops is waiting for me.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.750
So am I.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.583
Ground control to Cyclops.

05:09.583 --> 05:12.208
-Huh? What did you say?
-What's with you?

05:12.208 --> 05:15.750
We finally get
a night out together, and
you're a million miles away.

05:15.750 --> 05:19.375
You know, to me,
being an X-Man is the most
important job in the world.

05:21.333 --> 05:24.583
That's why I can't bear
the thought of letting
Professor Xavier down.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.750
And it's making you crazy.
You're doing the best you can,

05:27.750 --> 05:30.416
but you're no good
to the Professor
when you're like this.

05:30.416 --> 05:33.875
Relax a little.
For the good of the team.

05:38.958 --> 05:40.458
You're absolutely right.

05:41.583 --> 05:45.416
From this moment on,
my mind is on nothing but you.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.083
[man 1] Let go of my fruit.

05:58.083 --> 06:01.000
Hey. It's one of those mutants.
Somebody grab him.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.375
[whimpering]

06:03.208 --> 06:04.416
Help.

06:04.416 --> 06:05.875
What's he doing to us?

06:06.833 --> 06:07.875
[man 2] Grab him quick.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.875
[man 3] Don't let him get away.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.833
We've got to do something
before they hurt him.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.291
So much for our night off.

06:19.208 --> 06:22.250
[crowd clamoring]

06:22.250 --> 06:25.583
We'll teach you
to hunt us like animals.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.875
[people screaming]

06:41.875 --> 06:43.625
-[growling]
-[man screaming]

06:43.625 --> 06:45.083
Who are they?

06:46.291 --> 06:47.583
[people screaming]

06:47.583 --> 06:49.166
Must be mutants.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.750
Pay the price
for attacking Morlocks.

06:52.708 --> 06:55.125
[man screaming]

06:55.125 --> 06:58.708
They're dangerous.
We're going to have to
protect the crowd from them.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.875
-[man] The train!
-[train whistle blowing]

07:05.625 --> 07:08.333
[screaming]

07:11.708 --> 07:13.416
[roaring]

07:17.083 --> 07:18.875
I don't think so, buddy.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.458
[groans]

07:25.458 --> 07:27.208
I better not try that again.

07:27.208 --> 07:29.000
Without my visor,
I can't control these things.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.583
Sleep. I need to sleep.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.333
Must sleep.

07:39.958 --> 07:41.583
[all] Sleep.

07:41.583 --> 07:44.291
-I'm ready to sleep.
-[Annalee] I need to sleep.

07:44.291 --> 07:48.458
-[all] Must sleep.
-[Annalee] Must sleep.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.750
[all] I need to sleep.

07:53.416 --> 07:56.166
Good work, Annalee.
You'll be rewarded.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.291
Sunder, take them below.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.875
[Rogue] Where the heck
are the lovebirds?

08:18.875 --> 08:21.708
Who cares? Let 'em
be alone for a change.

08:22.208 --> 08:24.166
[growling]

08:26.291 --> 08:28.583
[groaning]

08:28.583 --> 08:30.458
Who dropped the house on me?

08:31.291 --> 08:34.875
Hey! Where am I?

08:34.875 --> 08:36.625
Thanks for trying to help me
up there.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.333
Who are you? My glasses.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.708
What happened to my power?

08:41.708 --> 08:44.250
You help Leech,
Leech help you.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.250
You see better now,
for a while.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.250
[Callisto] Welcome,

09:04.208 --> 09:07.625
pretty one. I am Callisto.

09:07.625 --> 09:10.000
You've already met
some of my tribe.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.458
We Morlocks are outcasts,
mutants too deformed
and unsightly

09:15.458 --> 09:18.000
to pass for human
on the surface world.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.416
Unlike you, we have no choice
but to dwell here,

09:21.416 --> 09:23.875
away from those who fear us.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.875
When I saw your bravery
and leadership,

09:26.875 --> 09:32.208
I knew it was my destiny
to have one such as you
to rule beside me.

09:39.875 --> 09:43.708
That is why I sent
this one into trouble
to help show you the way.

09:43.708 --> 09:47.416
Right. Where's Jean?

09:47.416 --> 09:50.333
When you agree to stay.

09:50.333 --> 09:51.708
Sorry. Not interested.

09:51.708 --> 09:54.000
That wasn't a request.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.333
Sunlight fuels my power.
I won't be much good
to you down here.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.875
Do I look like
I need a protector?

10:01.875 --> 10:05.083
To serve my people,
I need a companion.

10:05.083 --> 10:08.875
Someone to provide me an heir.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.875
So take out an ad.
Now where's Jean?

10:11.875 --> 10:13.291
Sunder.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.416
Does this help
change your mind?

10:17.416 --> 10:21.333
-Jean.
-He refuses me. Destroy her.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.583
-Forget it, lady.
-Hey!

10:25.583 --> 10:28.375
[Morlocks screaming]

10:28.375 --> 10:30.416
Scott's my date.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.583
Guards, restrain her!

10:37.458 --> 10:40.750
[Jean] Professor. We need you.
We've been captured.

10:40.750 --> 10:43.000
[Xavier] Jean, where are you?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.416
Jean?

10:47.125 --> 10:48.125
Let her go!

10:49.958 --> 10:53.125
That was very stupid.

10:53.125 --> 10:57.000
Stop it, you idiot.
I need him alive.

11:04.208 --> 11:08.000
[Xavier] This is as close as
I can pinpoint their location.

11:13.875 --> 11:16.083
-[Rogue] Storm?
-I am fine.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.625
We must find them.

11:17.625 --> 11:20.458
[Gambit] Gal,
it's tight down here.

11:20.458 --> 11:21.625
If things get rough--

11:21.625 --> 11:23.750
Can it, Cajun. It's her call.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.583
[train whistle blowing]

11:27.333 --> 11:28.375
Which way?

11:39.208 --> 11:42.416
Scott and Jean pick one strange
romantic hideaway, no?

11:42.416 --> 11:45.958
Shut up. I'm getting a scent.

11:45.958 --> 11:48.583
Someone may be tracking us.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.000
Hold it.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.625
Roaches grow big down here.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Sticky situation, mon ami.

12:05.583 --> 12:07.333
Not for long.

12:17.083 --> 12:20.500
[Storm gasping and shuddering]

12:22.500 --> 12:25.166
Help her.
She not going to make it.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.583
Let her ask.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.083
-Jean.
-Mommy?

12:41.708 --> 12:44.500
Who are these bad people?

12:44.500 --> 12:47.833
Leave me alone
with my daughter.

12:47.833 --> 12:53.250
Make them go away.
Please, Mommy.

12:53.250 --> 12:57.958
Lady, you picked
the wrong girl to adopt.

12:57.958 --> 13:02.875
Please. No.
Covered with scorpions.

13:02.875 --> 13:06.250
-Covered with scorpions.
-No.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.750
Covered with scorpions.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.958
Get them off me.

13:09.958 --> 13:12.000
What're you doing to my head?

13:13.083 --> 13:15.416
[roaring]

13:19.375 --> 13:24.083
Jean, you okay?
Don't worry. I'm here.

13:24.083 --> 13:29.291
Where am I?
What's hap-- Cyclops.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.625
We've got to help him.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.458
[Callisto]
You're too late, X-Men.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.333
No one can help him now.

13:36.958 --> 13:40.583
Cyclops. [gasps] Oh, no.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.208
[Jean sobbing]

13:43.208 --> 13:44.875
[growling]

13:47.166 --> 13:49.750
Your leader
was a great warrior.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.291
We mourn his loss.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.458
My Morlocks will provide

13:53.458 --> 13:55.416
safe passage
to the surface world.

13:57.416 --> 13:59.000
Great warrior, eh?

14:00.291 --> 14:03.458
How about we take him back
in pieces?

14:03.458 --> 14:05.333
Wolverine, no, don't.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.166
[screaming]

14:10.583 --> 14:15.583
Cyke has his problems,
but he don't smell
like a Morlock.

14:15.583 --> 14:19.583
Looks like we're going to
have to persuade them
to give him back.

14:19.583 --> 14:22.833
Fools. You can't fight us here.

14:31.416 --> 14:34.083
You all need to brush up
on your hospitality.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.708
[Storm] Stay together.
Do not let them divide us.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.750
[Storm groans and gasps]

14:47.291 --> 14:51.000
Here is mud in your eyes,
messubterranean freres.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.875
[Sunder] Come down here
and fight me fair.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.125
-[Sunder screams]
-[Rogue] That fair enough?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.250
Come on, lady.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.583
[screams]

15:03.583 --> 15:04.750
You can do better than...

15:06.291 --> 15:08.708
That's more like it. Huh?

15:10.708 --> 15:13.291
Oh, I love it
when they play hard to get.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.416
Nice shooting.

15:26.416 --> 15:27.458
Huh?

15:28.125 --> 15:29.416
Where'd she go?

15:30.333 --> 15:31.708
Don't tell me you missed me?

15:31.708 --> 15:35.125
Hey! Get off of me!

15:35.125 --> 15:36.625
Sure, sugar.

15:37.958 --> 15:39.333
[groaning]

15:41.333 --> 15:44.416
Stay back, old woman.
You gonna get hurt.

15:44.416 --> 15:48.125
I'm feeling fine, dearie.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.708
But you don't look so good.
What's wrong?

15:50.708 --> 15:52.833
Got a touch of the plague?

15:54.833 --> 15:56.875
Quickly. Get her off of him.

15:58.208 --> 16:02.708
[groaning]

16:02.708 --> 16:05.375
The fever... [groans]

16:05.375 --> 16:08.583
That old gal got you bad.
Storm!

16:08.583 --> 16:11.000
Get him back
to the mansion immediately.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.125
[Rogue] You got it.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.208
-Jean!
-[Jean screams]

16:19.375 --> 16:20.833
Put me down.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.750
[screams]

16:28.125 --> 16:31.875
Run all you like, lady.
I like to hunt.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.000
[sniffing] Cyclops.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.250
[Wolverine roaring]

16:41.458 --> 16:44.958
I could make a couple of women
real sad right now,

16:44.958 --> 16:49.166
but if there's one thing
I can't stand,
it's seeing Jean cry.

16:55.458 --> 17:00.583
So, he loves the woman.
You know what to do.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.583
See if you can contact
Wolverine telepathically.

17:03.583 --> 17:06.000
Don't bother.
Blow those slugs off,

17:06.000 --> 17:07.875
and let's bust out
of this puke hole.

17:07.875 --> 17:12.875
So close, so tight. So tight...

17:12.875 --> 17:15.250
[Callisto] Now for the animal.

17:15.250 --> 17:19.708
You.
Keeping me from what is mine.

17:19.708 --> 17:23.125
You.
Keeping me from what's mine.

17:24.708 --> 17:25.750
Wolverine!

17:28.166 --> 17:29.458
Fight it, Wolverine.

17:32.166 --> 17:35.500
She's making you love her.

17:35.500 --> 17:41.208
-Making you weaker.
-No. I can't.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.583
[screams]

17:48.500 --> 17:51.875
Anyone moves,
and Cyclops is gone.

17:51.875 --> 17:55.708
At my order, destroy the X-Men

17:55.708 --> 18:00.708
one at a time,
until their leader
agrees to my terms.

18:00.708 --> 18:04.000
Now we shall decide it,
Callisto.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.583
You and I. Now.

18:06.583 --> 18:10.708
For Cyclops
and for the leadership
of the Morlocks.

18:10.708 --> 18:12.958
Storm, are you nuts?

18:12.958 --> 18:17.750
Refuse me and lose
the respect of your tribe.
Well?

18:17.750 --> 18:20.833
Use your mutant powers
in any way,

18:20.833 --> 18:23.458
a crack of thunder,
the slightest breeze,

18:23.458 --> 18:25.625
and my Morlocks
will kill your people.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.458
Agreed.

18:34.875 --> 18:37.625
-Storm grunts]
-You're slow, Storm.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.166
Surface life make you soft?

18:40.166 --> 18:41.583
[growls]

18:45.000 --> 18:46.333
Keep your head, lady.

18:58.583 --> 19:00.291
You've lost.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.125
Callisto.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.750
But you shall not die.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.833
Killing is not the X-Men's way.

19:08.625 --> 19:13.750
Morlocks... you no longer
need to live in darkness.

19:14.375 --> 19:17.875
As your leader,
I offer you safe haven

19:17.875 --> 19:20.416
at the mansion with the X-Men.

19:20.416 --> 19:22.750
You are outcasts no more.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.083
Our place is down here.

19:26.083 --> 19:29.125
We can't live
among normal humans.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.875
When humanity
accepts mutantkind,

19:31.875 --> 19:34.416
then we will
come to the surface.

19:34.416 --> 19:37.625
When such acceptance
is achieved,

19:37.625 --> 19:39.458
I shall return to you.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.166
Until then,
Callisto will rule in my place.

19:49.583 --> 19:50.583
[groans]

19:51.875 --> 19:55.416
Jean? Did I miss something?

19:55.416 --> 19:57.625
Oh, nothing much.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.875
I never dreamed you had
such beautiful eyes.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.833
[Cyclops] How's Gambit doing?

20:07.833 --> 20:10.208
[Xavier] Recuperating nicely.

20:10.208 --> 20:13.500
It's almost as miraculous
as your return from the dead.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.875
I take it your date was
sufficiently memorable.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.750
Yeah.
Now all we need is a vacation.

20:20.750 --> 20:24.500
Jean tells me
you acquitted yourself well
as field commander.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.291
The entire team
nearly perished.

20:27.291 --> 20:31.333
But they didn't, and I think
I have you to thank for that.

20:32.750 --> 20:36.208
Wolverine? Jean and I
wanted to thank you for...

20:38.583 --> 20:39.583
He's gone.
