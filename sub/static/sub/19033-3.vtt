00:16.983 --> 00:19.283
New York city.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.119
It's changed a lot
since I first came here

00:21.154 --> 00:24.222
as a young actor.

00:24.257 --> 00:26.124
The all night diner
that we used to go to

00:26.159 --> 00:28.893
after the shows, gone.

00:28.928 --> 00:32.563
Not a single phone
booth in sight anywhere.

00:33.166 --> 00:36.134
I came here for the same
reason that most people come,

00:36.169 --> 00:38.169
to make it.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.138
But it was a major
change for a young boy

00:40.173 --> 00:43.307
from rural Mississippi.

00:44.177 --> 00:48.046
Cities like this
separate us from nature.

00:48.081 --> 00:52.984
Most of us spend our days in
climate-controlled offices and

00:53.019 --> 00:55.486
looking down at
computer screens,

00:55.522 --> 00:59.290
rather than up at the stars.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.926
Our ancestors were
always in touch with the

01:01.961 --> 01:04.861
rawer elements of nature,

01:04.897 --> 01:07.031
that's where they
saw evidence of god,

01:07.067 --> 01:09.967
blowing in the wind,
coming down the warm way

01:10.003 --> 01:12.870
of the sun.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.472
But even in our modern world,

01:14.507 --> 01:16.941
we still share something
with our ancestors.

01:16.976 --> 01:22.980
That is the desire to find
proof that god exists.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.087
Have we cut god out
of our modern lives?

01:29.389 --> 01:34.425
Or are there special moments
when god breaks through and

01:36.062 --> 01:39.831
makes his presence known?

01:42.235 --> 01:48.172
I'm on a quest to understand
how people find proof of god.

01:50.643 --> 01:54.846
I'll visit a man who heard
god on September the 11th.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.082
And I felt god speak to me.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.917
In a very still voice,
I felt god saying,

01:59.953 --> 02:02.553
"It’s going to be okay."

02:02.589 --> 02:04.889
Discover how Muslims see god in the

02:04.924 --> 02:06.891
words of their holy book.

02:06.926 --> 02:09.026
For Christians, god's
word is Jesus come to

02:09.062 --> 02:10.895
earth in the flesh.

02:10.930 --> 02:14.465
For Muslims the Koran is
god come to earth in the book.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.901
I will talk with a
Buddhist master who

02:16.936 --> 02:19.504
feels divine power inside him.

02:19.539 --> 02:22.106
Your inner energy,
you can manifest sort of

02:22.142 --> 02:23.474
like the divine?

02:23.510 --> 02:26.077
Correct.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.846
And meet a physicist
who has faith that

02:28.882 --> 02:31.349
science will lead him to god.

02:31.384 --> 02:34.585
The more we
learn about the world,

02:34.621 --> 02:38.256
it points more towards god,
rather than less.

02:38.925 --> 02:43.461
Can we all in our own
way find proof of god?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.355
For believers around the world,

03:11.391 --> 03:14.425
prayer is an act of faith in god.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.962
But how do we find proof of god?

03:22.168 --> 03:26.170
Often, it's in times of crises.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.940
Many people feel certain
that god steps in to

03:28.975 --> 03:32.043
save their lives.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.913
I'm on my way to meet a
devout Christian who felt god's

03:35.949 --> 03:42.353
presence on the fateful day
of September 11, 2001.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.489
His name is Sujo John.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.125
Sujo?

03:49.329 --> 03:50.628
Morgan freeman.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.363
Great to meet you, sir.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.065
Please.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.600
Thank you.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.602
You were born and raised in India.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.971
How do you happen
to be christian?

04:00.006 --> 04:02.406
You know my parents
come from the southern part of

04:02.442 --> 04:05.409
India where Christianity
goes way back over 2,000 years.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.911
Tell me about the day that

04:06.946 --> 04:08.446
changed your life.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.848
It started off
as a normal day, a clear,

04:10.883 --> 04:13.184
cloudless day in New York city.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.353
Me and my wife, we both
find work in the towers.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.822
I'm on the 81st floor
of the north tower,

04:17.857 --> 04:20.391
My wife on the 71st of the south.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.327
My wife is four months
pregnant with our first child

04:23.363 --> 04:25.997
and we're looking forward
to the birth of that child.

04:26.032 --> 04:30.034
You were in
the north tower and what?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.872
8:46 in the morning,
American flight 11,

04:34.907 --> 04:37.875
flying at 440 miles an hour,
this huge jet plane comes

04:37.910 --> 04:40.077
crashing the north tower
and I hear this

04:40.113 --> 04:41.479
incredible explosion.

04:43.516 --> 04:46.083
And fire breaks on our floor,
walls start collapsing around

04:46.119 --> 04:48.286
us and I’m saying,
"god, if this building is

04:48.321 --> 04:50.488
gonna go down, I’m never
gonna see my wife again."

04:50.523 --> 04:53.057
I'm never gonna see that
child that my wife is carrying.

04:53.092 --> 04:56.193
Someone from our floor rallies us.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.496
He says "we've got to beat this fire.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.865
We've gotta get out of this place."

05:00.900 --> 05:02.199
So we start crawling
and fighting our way

05:02.235 --> 05:03.601
through the fire,

05:03.636 --> 05:07.238
looking for the nearest stairwell.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.208
Thousands of people are
joining us on that stairwell.

05:11.444 --> 05:14.378
We get to the 43rd or the
44th floor when I see these

05:14.414 --> 05:18.783
firemen, policemen,
going up, as we are going down.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.089
We had no idea then
that these men were in a way

05:25.124 --> 05:26.957
walking up to their death.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.094
I can imagine.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.964
Now we hear another explosion.

05:36.569 --> 05:40.604
This is the second plane
crashing into the second tower.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.239
And I was going crazy,

05:42.275 --> 05:44.308
realizing for sure my wife is dead.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.012
What's life for me if
my wife is not alive?

05:48.481 --> 05:50.581
So you did get out, you got down?

05:50.616 --> 05:51.716
Correct.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.150
So now you're down on the ground floor,

05:53.186 --> 05:54.552
you're in the plaza.

05:54.587 --> 05:55.920
Correct.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.254
Now what happens?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.190
Walking towards the south tower...

05:59.225 --> 06:00.257
And you thought your wife

06:00.293 --> 06:02.426
was in there?

06:02.462 --> 06:04.362
Yes, I was very
sure that she was there

06:04.397 --> 06:07.098
because she has to be
at work at 8:40 every day.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.367
Did you get there?

06:09.402 --> 06:13.337
No, actually the grounds
are shaking violently.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.474
The glass is shattering.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.310
I thought it was a bomb
and this was the south tower

06:19.345 --> 06:22.913
imploding and going down.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.382
As the building is collapsing,

06:24.417 --> 06:27.985
there's people with me
and I’m huddled with them.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.453
And I felt god speak to me.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.389
In a very still voice,
I felt god saying,

06:31.424 --> 06:33.391
"it's going to be okay."

06:33.426 --> 06:36.193
You heard the voice of god?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.461
He spoke to you?

06:37.497 --> 06:40.498
I did not hear god speak
to me in an audible way,

06:40.533 --> 06:43.300
but I felt god's inner
voice speak to me and ask

06:43.336 --> 06:45.035
the people to pray with me.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.106
What happened then?

06:49.675 --> 06:51.542
We prayed for a few minutes.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.310
My head is rolling,
the ground's shaking,

06:53.346 --> 06:56.480
I feel stuff fall on me.

06:59.285 --> 07:03.387
There's smoke all around
me, could not breath.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.390
When the south tower collapsed,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.826
it sort of took you with it.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.495
You were buried in rubble and ash.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.597
I was kind of resigned
to my fate that

07:13.633 --> 07:17.468
I was going to die here.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.806
But I realize I’m alive.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.108
I crawl my way around to
realize that these people who

07:24.143 --> 07:28.546
had prayed with me,
they did not make it.

07:29.015 --> 07:32.349
I see a red light flashing
to the soot and the smoke.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.518
It's a flashing light coming
out of an ambulance and

07:34.554 --> 07:36.387
part of the ambulance was crushed,

07:36.422 --> 07:39.590
but the light was still flashing.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.492
So I’m on the streets of Manhattan,

07:41.527 --> 07:43.527
I can't even recognize
it, it's like a war zone,

07:43.563 --> 07:46.330
the debris and ash and dust.

07:46.365 --> 07:50.267
Now you are a lone
survivor so to speak.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.303
I’m thinking about my wife.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.505
It was just the most
incredible trauma and

07:54.540 --> 07:56.907
pain to experience.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.944
The fear of the unknown,
fear about my wife.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.914
Then my cellphone rings for
the very first time that day.

08:09.455 --> 08:13.424
I see my wife's caller id and
I'm thinking this is not her,

08:13.459 --> 08:16.594
It's someone else calling me
saying "your wife is dead."

08:16.629 --> 08:18.963
But when I said hello, it's my wife.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.299
And she hears my
voice loud and clear.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.805
But her first words were,
"babe, are you alive?"

08:27.840 --> 08:29.206
Are you alive?

08:29.242 --> 08:30.508
She thought I was dead and I thought

08:30.543 --> 08:32.208
She was dead.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.977
Alright, so we're looking at a

08:34.013 --> 08:35.946
miracle right here.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.048
Yes, and it was god
that preserved and

08:38.083 --> 08:39.383
saved my life.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.352
It's proof to me
that there is a god.

08:41.386 --> 08:43.953
It seems like if god was going to spare

08:43.990 --> 08:45.990
one he would spare them all.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.625
That's a great question,

08:47.660 --> 08:50.528
but life on earth is such
that no one is guaranteed

08:50.563 --> 08:52.162
a today or tomorrow.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.099
Every human being walking on
this earth will face death.

08:55.134 --> 08:56.567
But here's what
I know from experience.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.537
When you walk with god and
go through the storms of life,

08:59.572 --> 09:02.072
you have this peace
and the presence of god.

09:02.108 --> 09:04.275
So if you carry the presence of god,

09:04.310 --> 09:07.811
even though it might be
death, it's going to be okay.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.280
Sujo and his wife, Mary,

09:09.315 --> 09:11.882
now have three children.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.418
He left his corporate
job and dedicated his life

09:14.453 --> 09:17.087
to helping others.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.391
His current mission
in his native India,

09:20.426 --> 09:23.494
is to help save women
from human trafficking.

09:24.997 --> 09:29.500
You are using just
the power of life...

09:32.238 --> 09:34.138
to give life to others.

09:34.173 --> 09:35.873
Yes, I feel very
blessed that god's

09:35.908 --> 09:37.308
called me into this.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.877
I'm always excited about
whatever god brings my way.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.478
Well it's wonderful to talk to you.

09:41.514 --> 09:42.613
Thank you sir.

09:42.648 --> 09:45.115
Honor to be with you.

09:46.385 --> 09:50.421
Sujo John's
survival is extraordinary.

09:50.456 --> 09:53.290
Some say it's miraculous.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.261
What's most remarkable to
me is that Sujo felt the

09:57.296 --> 10:00.898
unmistakable presence of
god, even while death and

10:00.933 --> 10:04.034
destruction were
all around him.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.604
But what about the rest of us?

10:06.639 --> 10:10.174
Is going through a horrifying
experience like that

10:10.209 --> 10:14.912
the only way to feel
proof of the divine?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.949
Or can we encounter
god through the

10:18.985 --> 10:22.252
experiences of others?

10:22.288 --> 10:26.123
Around the world, the
faithful make pilgrimage to

10:26.158 --> 10:30.561
miracle sites, places
like Fatima in Portugal.

10:34.333 --> 10:39.136
In 1917, three young shepherds
claimed they were told by the

10:39.171 --> 10:42.339
virgin Mary that a miracle
would take place here on

10:42.375 --> 10:45.209
October the 13th.

10:45.244 --> 10:49.413
A crowd gathered and
on the appointed day,

10:49.448 --> 10:52.950
thousands said they
saw the sun dance back and

10:52.985 --> 10:56.086
forth in the sky.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.023
Millions of pilgrims
who flock to Fatima see this

10:59.058 --> 11:02.493
miracle site as
undeniable proof of god.

11:02.528 --> 11:06.163
Being there, reinforces their
belief that god can make

11:06.198 --> 11:10.034
dramatic interventions
in our world.

11:10.069 --> 11:13.971
But many believers also
feel the divine guiding us

11:14.006 --> 11:17.241
in a far subtler way,

11:17.276 --> 11:21.545
In the ebb and flow
of their daily lives.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.954
I'm in New York to learn
about an ancient

11:30.990 --> 11:34.358
religion from West Africa.

11:45.237 --> 11:47.905
The Ifa faith of the Yoruba
people crossed the Atlantic

11:47.940 --> 11:51.308
with slavery and is still
practiced today in Harlem.

11:53.479 --> 11:57.481
Followers of Ifa believe the
world is filled with divine

11:57.516 --> 12:01.552
energy and their fates
are guided by that energy.

12:03.622 --> 12:04.955
Hello, how are you?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.123
Hello, I am very well.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.891
Such a pleasure to meet you.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.460
Thank you.

12:09.495 --> 12:12.062
Funlayo Wood is a Harvard
student of African studies and

12:12.098 --> 12:16.066
an Ifa priestess in training.

12:16.102 --> 12:19.937
And Oluwole Ifakunle
Is a babalawo,

12:19.972 --> 12:23.040
or priest, of Harlem.

12:27.146 --> 12:28.278
How are you?

12:28.314 --> 12:29.646
I'm well sir, how are you?

12:29.682 --> 12:30.881
I'm fine thank you.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.249
Very good.

12:32.284 --> 12:35.219
So baba, tell me
about your religion.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.554
Well we have various deities.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.389
We have deities like Orun.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.858
We have Eledba.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.192
Eledba is the road-opener.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.194
Orun is the road-clearer.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.297
And then we have Oyansa,
who is the mother of nine.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.432
We have Yemoja.

12:48.467 --> 12:52.870
There's a variety
of different deities.

12:53.105 --> 12:57.274
So we all seek some proof of god.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.643
Do you?

12:59.678 --> 13:03.247
Well the proof comes to our divination,

13:03.282 --> 13:06.850
and our process of being able
to connect with our deities.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.352
Divination.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.354
Do you mean like fortune telling?

13:10.389 --> 13:12.022
Divination is about

13:12.057 --> 13:13.891
finding one's purpose.

13:13.926 --> 13:16.460
You see what happens
in Yoyoga faith,

13:16.495 --> 13:18.862
most people are trying
to connect with gods and

13:18.898 --> 13:21.465
goddesses and that's
where we use or do.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.634
The way that a divination is arranged

13:23.669 --> 13:25.435
is in what we call Odu.

13:25.471 --> 13:30.007
And so there are 256 different
Odu and each one can contains

13:30.042 --> 13:33.010
different information,
both about energy states

13:33.045 --> 13:34.545
that are going on around us,

13:34.580 --> 13:37.181
as well as all different
aspects of life.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.215
I can show you.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.116
You can?

13:39.151 --> 13:40.617
Sure, absolutely, yes.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.186
It would be our pleasure.

13:49.528 --> 13:52.563
Babalawo is taking me to his personal

13:52.598 --> 13:56.200
shrine so I can see how it works.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.435
Guys, come on in, welcome.

13:58.470 --> 13:59.937
Yes, welcome.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.205
Thank you.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.373
So this is my shrine over here.

14:03.409 --> 14:07.544
This is the place where
we make divination.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.380
So calling on the divine
is what we're going to do.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.982
If I’m going to do a divination,

14:12.017 --> 14:13.951
what would I ask?

14:13.986 --> 14:16.987
Divination is performed for most

14:17.022 --> 14:19.423
important things in our
lives, naming ceremonies,

14:19.458 --> 14:23.026
perform for weddings,
for sicknesses.

14:23.062 --> 14:27.598
So this is the Opon,
The Opon of Ifa.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.234
And this represents the four
quarters of the universe,

14:30.269 --> 14:32.402
so we bring in the four
quadrants of the world

14:32.438 --> 14:38.075
together so we can get a
glimpse into the future.

14:39.278 --> 14:42.079
Babalawo starts an Ifa divination

14:42.114 --> 14:44.982
For Funlayo.

14:46.318 --> 14:49.486
16 sacred palm nuts will help him read

14:49.521 --> 14:54.291
how the divine Odu energy
is going to shape her future.

15:03.435 --> 15:05.602
Caught all these divinities of Africa,

15:05.638 --> 15:07.337
to see, to glimpse.

15:07.373 --> 15:10.407
The reality of this for Funlayo.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.809
As he passes the palm
nuts from one hand to

15:12.845 --> 15:18.015
the other, he counts how many
remain in his original hand.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.384
the markings he makes on
the board describe the Odu

15:20.419 --> 15:23.487
that's around Funlayo.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.555
It's a binary system,

15:25.591 --> 15:30.294
so you could have ones and
twos and so there are 256

15:30.329 --> 15:35.399
possible combinations of
ones and twos that can come up.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.438
So this is a very auspicious sign.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.974
Talking about housing
and wealth coming to her.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.309
So she's gonna make some money!

15:46.612 --> 15:48.178
Yes, something's
about to happen.

15:48.213 --> 15:49.579
Maybe you brought me
some blessings today.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.248
You have an issue with housing?

15:51.283 --> 15:52.582
Yes, I've been looking for

15:52.618 --> 15:54.518
an apartment actually.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.288
Just last night I was
calling a woman about an

15:58.324 --> 15:59.489
apartment that I was
thinking about getting.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.291
And so we give a praise to that

16:01.327 --> 16:03.126
place of [inaudible].

16:03.162 --> 16:06.163
Now Funlayo, let me ask you,

16:06.198 --> 16:09.967
how does this prove
god's existence to you?

16:10.369 --> 16:13.003
Every single time
I’ve received a divination,

16:13.038 --> 16:16.139
the advice has been on point.

16:16.175 --> 16:19.343
And so doing divination is
that way of glancing down,

16:19.378 --> 16:22.245
glancing up, glancing
side to side and just seeing

16:22.281 --> 16:24.948
what type of
energy is around us.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.583
I like to really talk about Ifa

16:26.618 --> 16:28.251
as being destiny.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.421
You know because if we are
on our destiny in our paths,

16:31.457 --> 16:33.623
then we are going to be
going in a direction that

16:33.659 --> 16:36.393
will help us to prevail
and we'll be successful and

16:36.428 --> 16:37.928
victorious in our life.

16:37.963 --> 16:39.329
Thank you for a wonderful time.

16:39.365 --> 16:42.499
Oh it's my pleasure,
it's my pleasure.

16:44.436 --> 16:47.204
The tradition of the
Yoruba says the gods

16:47.239 --> 16:50.574
show themselves on every
roll of a palm nut,

16:50.609 --> 16:55.012
toss of a coin and his
ideas come into many things.

16:56.148 --> 16:59.850
If you believe in god,
you can see god in every

16:59.885 --> 17:02.386
facet of your life.

17:02.421 --> 17:06.589
It's not evidence that you
can present to a scientist,

17:06.625 --> 17:09.960
but it's evidence
you feel inside.

17:12.164 --> 17:16.833
In Ethiopia, about 100,000
Orthodox Christians gather to

17:16.868 --> 17:20.503
witness god manifest
himself in a similar way,

17:20.539 --> 17:24.107
to Usher in the new year.

17:26.512 --> 17:30.614
Historian Dr. Cynthia Khan has
traveled to Ethiopia to attend

17:30.649 --> 17:33.383
one of the country's
largest religious festivals,

17:33.419 --> 17:36.820
called Meskel.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.990
She's accompanied
By Solomon Gezena,

17:40.025 --> 17:43.860
an Ethiopian religious scholar.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.196
Look Cynthia, this place is called

17:46.231 --> 17:50.333
Meskel Square and
this is called demera.

17:50.369 --> 17:53.103
This is the center piece
of this celebration,

17:53.138 --> 17:54.604
Feast of Meskel.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.705
What is it?

17:55.741 --> 17:59.509
Its symbolic value goes to 326 AD

17:59.545 --> 18:01.812
to queen Helena.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.448
Legend has it queen Helena,

18:04.483 --> 18:07.584
the mother of Roman
emperor Constantine,

18:07.619 --> 18:10.320
was on a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem searching for one of

18:10.355 --> 18:14.858
the most important relics
in Christianity, Jesus’s cross.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.161
According to the
Ethiopian legend,

18:18.197 --> 18:20.864
the cross was
buried underground and

18:20.899 --> 18:23.834
Helena didn't know where.

18:23.869 --> 18:27.137
So she prayed to god for guidance.

18:27.172 --> 18:30.907
God told her to erect
the giant bonfire.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.577
She was told to make exactly that

18:33.612 --> 18:35.412
piece and fire it.

18:35.447 --> 18:40.283
Then after the smoke goes
up and down and indicated in...

18:40.319 --> 18:42.119
a big pointer to tell
her where to dig.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.955
Exactly, this shows
a divine intervention.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.490
It's a proof of god.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.325
Yes.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.427
Queen Helena
followed the smoke of her

18:50.462 --> 18:52.462
bonfire to discover the
location of Jesus’s cross.

18:52.498 --> 18:56.533
The replica of that
bonfire, the demera, is,

18:56.568 --> 19:00.904
to Ethiopian Christians,
a symbol of god's intervention.

19:02.107 --> 19:03.507
So they light this on fire?

19:03.542 --> 19:04.674
Yes.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.009
Why do they light it
and then what happens

19:06.044 --> 19:07.477
after that?

19:07.513 --> 19:09.513
Yeah, there is an
interesting prophecy

19:09.548 --> 19:10.614
after they light it.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.150
When it collapses, the
direction where it collapses

19:13.185 --> 19:15.852
also has a meaning.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.355
The direction in which
the demera collapses

19:18.390 --> 19:22.993
signals a good or bad omen
for the coming year in Ethiopia.

19:29.034 --> 19:32.502
Every year, people flock to
Addis Ababa to take part in

19:32.538 --> 19:36.773
the festival, to
witness proof of god.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.414
There is singing, dancing
and even a re-enactment

19:44.449 --> 19:47.851
of Helena finding the cross.

19:47.886 --> 19:52.055
But what everyone awaits is
the lighting of the demera and

19:52.090 --> 19:55.492
the revelation of its
prophecy for the coming year.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.960
So they're all
gathering there now?

19:56.995 --> 19:58.195
Look at them.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.863
Yes, exactly.

19:59.898 --> 20:01.831
He's blessing four
sides of the demera.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.966
They light four sides?

20:03.001 --> 20:04.134
Like four sides of the world?

20:04.169 --> 20:05.535
Exactly.

20:05.571 --> 20:08.205
Yeah.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.307
Look, look, look at that.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.609
Wow, it's a little frightening,

20:12.644 --> 20:13.944
It's so big.

20:13.979 --> 20:17.013
Yes, alright.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.357
All eyes are now on the burning

20:27.392 --> 20:31.127
wooden frame of the demera.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.996
If it topples to the west,

20:33.031 --> 20:36.333
it will be a bad
omen for Ethiopia.

20:36.368 --> 20:41.137
If it falls to the east,
the country will prosper.

20:41.173 --> 20:44.174
At east, at east.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.876
North, east.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.545
East.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.214
East.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.482
So what does that mean for the

20:52.517 --> 20:53.917
year in Ethiopia?

20:53.952 --> 20:57.454
Peace, love, Ethiopia will shine.

20:57.489 --> 20:59.522
The burning of the demera is

20:59.558 --> 21:02.125
no miraculous apparition.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.562
It's not the burning
bush that Moses saw.

21:05.597 --> 21:09.132
But each year the people
of Ethiopia come together

21:09.167 --> 21:12.035
to witness this moment.

21:12.070 --> 21:16.039
And together they feel
the presence of god in

21:16.074 --> 21:18.375
that falling fire.

21:18.410 --> 21:24.347
They sense an invisible
hand guiding their destiny.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.217
But other believers don't
look for proof of god in

21:27.252 --> 21:31.187
the twists of
fate that befall them.

21:31.623 --> 21:35.125
They see evidence of the
divine inside their bodies,

21:36.361 --> 21:39.162
giving them god-like powers.

21:49.875 --> 21:54.377
There is an inner spark in all of us.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.579
You can see it in the eyes.

21:56.615 --> 22:01.351
Something that says,
"I’m alive."

22:01.586 --> 22:05.689
We can't define what it is,
but we all recognize it.

22:06.091 --> 22:09.125
Religions call it
the soul, a force,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.728
that connects us to the divine.

22:11.763 --> 22:15.398
And perhaps it is divine.

22:17.803 --> 22:21.404
Is proof of god inside us?

22:25.210 --> 22:28.778
I've come to one of the
coldest places in New York city,

22:28.814 --> 22:32.349
a cocktail bar made from ice.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.850
Pop this on for me.

22:33.885 --> 22:35.785
Right.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.120
Ready for the ice bar?

22:37.155 --> 22:38.188
I’m ready.

22:38.223 --> 22:39.889
Alright, perfect.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.392
I’m here to meet a man
who claims he can

22:42.427 --> 22:45.829
harness the divine
within himself.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.768
This is Tulku Lobsang.

22:51.803 --> 22:56.172
He's a Tibetan Buddhist
Tantrayana master.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.042
And he's meditating in
a room that's kept at just

22:59.077 --> 23:01.611
23 degrees Fahrenheit,

23:01.646 --> 23:06.383
wearing only a
thin cotton t-shirt.

23:07.519 --> 23:10.253
Most of us wouldn't
last for more than a minute

23:10.288 --> 23:13.790
without wanting to run and
put on a jacket.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.659
Tulku lobsang?

23:20.132 --> 23:22.799
Hello.

23:23.769 --> 23:27.704
I mean it's minus five degrees

23:27.739 --> 23:29.739
Celsius in here.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.875
That's not just cold,
that's freezing.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.276
Do you mind telling me

23:33.311 --> 23:35.512
what you're doing?

23:35.547 --> 23:38.448
Ah I’m doing
one of the most sacred

23:38.483 --> 23:41.551
Buddhist Tantrayana practice,

23:41.586 --> 23:43.787
what we call inner fire, tummo.

23:43.822 --> 23:44.888
Tummo?

23:44.923 --> 23:46.589
Yeah.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.591
And you're not just ignoring the cold,

23:48.627 --> 23:49.793
you're literally changing
your body temperature,

23:49.828 --> 23:51.227
is that right?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.762
Exactly, correct.

23:52.798 --> 23:56.366
With the power of the
visualization and then

23:56.401 --> 23:59.102
generate inner heat.

23:59.137 --> 24:00.770
In meditating you make this happen?

24:00.806 --> 24:01.805
Correct.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.072
Alright.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.810
I'm from Mississippi,
I hate the cold.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.211
Yes.

24:08.246 --> 24:09.546
My nose is running already.

24:09.581 --> 24:12.348
So I tell you what
I'm gonna do...

24:12.384 --> 24:14.751
I'm gonna go outside
where it's warmer...

24:14.786 --> 24:16.219
Yes.

24:16.254 --> 24:17.487
And you let me know when you're

24:17.522 --> 24:18.555
ready to come out.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.290
Okay, I will continue practicing.

24:20.325 --> 24:21.357
Thank you.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.460
Thank you.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.668
Tummo, a 900 year old form of

24:31.703 --> 24:35.071
Buddhist meditation, has
long fascinated scientists.

24:35.106 --> 24:39.476
Studies have shown that monks
practicing tummo can control

24:39.511 --> 24:41.678
their autonomic nervous
system and raise

24:41.713 --> 24:45.615
their body temperature.

24:46.852 --> 24:49.719
Buddhists with Lobsang's
training can raise their core

24:49.754 --> 24:55.825
temperature to a low fever,
about 101 degrees Fahrenheit.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.430
They can also
endure extreme cold,

25:00.465 --> 25:04.267
up to 20 degrees
below zero for hours,

25:04.302 --> 25:07.837
something that would give
most of us hypothermia.

25:07.873 --> 25:09.739
So how do you feel?

25:09.774 --> 25:10.773
It’s good.

25:10.809 --> 25:11.774
Good?

25:11.810 --> 25:12.842
Yeah.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.611
This isn't just like a party trick?

25:14.646 --> 25:18.515
That is the method
of to discover your

25:18.550 --> 25:22.218
hidden nature or you
call a Buddha nature.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.525
The Buddha taught his followers

25:28.560 --> 25:32.161
meditation as one of the tools
to obtain enlightenment,

25:32.197 --> 25:35.331
the goal of Buddhism.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.434
During the meditation,
followers are supposed to open

25:38.470 --> 25:41.237
their minds and keep their
thoughts away from all

25:41.273 --> 25:44.073
material necessity.

25:44.109 --> 25:48.177
Tummo is an advanced form
of meditation in which

25:48.213 --> 25:54.651
practitioners try to connect
to their real inner power.

26:12.771 --> 26:17.407
I'm curious to know whether
Tulku Lobsang finds proof of

26:17.442 --> 26:21.110
the divine in his practice.

26:22.847 --> 26:26.749
Oh my goodness, golly!

26:26.785 --> 26:29.218
So, you do this...

26:29.254 --> 26:31.487
this part of tummo?

26:31.523 --> 26:32.522
Correct.

26:32.557 --> 26:34.557
This is part of tummo, yes.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.660
But tummo is not
only this exercise.

26:37.696 --> 26:42.198
Most important, tummo
use the power of mind.

26:42.233 --> 26:46.202
This is how you get
into a state where you

26:46.237 --> 26:49.806
isolate your inner
energy, your inner power?

26:49.841 --> 26:51.507
Correct.

26:51.543 --> 26:56.512
With the power of exercise,
with the holding the breath

26:56.548 --> 27:01.184
and with the concentration and
you open all of your channels

27:01.219 --> 27:06.289
and then all energy flowing
and then inner fire come in

27:06.324 --> 27:10.460
and then bliss come in
and then you experience

27:10.495 --> 27:14.063
non-conceptional state of
mind what Buddhists call...

27:14.099 --> 27:15.531
Non-conceptual?

27:15.567 --> 27:18.501
Yeah, non-conceptual state of mind

27:18.536 --> 27:22.338
means mind
without any thought.

27:22.374 --> 27:26.009
That's what we
call Buddha nature.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.478
The non-conceptual state of mind

27:28.513 --> 27:31.481
reminds of me of Pentecostal
Christians who surrender

27:31.516 --> 27:34.484
themselves to the
Holy Spirit to speak in an

27:34.519 --> 27:36.686
unintelligible language.

27:40.358 --> 27:43.626
It reminds me of the Masong
in Thailand who are possessed

27:43.662 --> 27:48.331
by the Taoist gods during
the nine emperor gods festival.

27:49.768 --> 27:53.069
People in both of these
faiths find proof of a

27:53.104 --> 27:56.439
higher power in these rituals.

27:56.474 --> 27:59.709
But Buddhists hope to find
in their most elevated moments

27:59.744 --> 28:04.447
is not god, but their Buddha nature.

28:06.418 --> 28:11.754
So in Buddhism, you don't
use the term or the idea

28:11.790 --> 28:13.389
of the divine.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.225
We don't believe this kind of

28:16.261 --> 28:22.331
traditional, maybe god, or
this select god but we believe

28:23.301 --> 28:25.735
we all have a Buddha nature.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.837
We all want to be happy.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.273
Nobody wants suffering.

28:30.308 --> 28:31.541
The Buddha nature,

28:31.576 --> 28:33.476
is that sort of like
the divine is inside?

28:33.511 --> 28:34.610
Correct.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.245
That it is where it is.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.513
That's correct, that's correct.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.215
Okay, well now,

28:39.250 --> 28:40.616
see that resonates with me also.

28:40.652 --> 28:41.784
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.220
I believe that divine
is what's within us.

28:44.255 --> 28:45.688
Correct, that's it.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.757
But what you are saying, I think,

28:47.792 --> 28:49.158
is that through tummo...

28:49.194 --> 28:50.693
Yes.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.795
You can pretty much get in touch with,

28:52.831 --> 28:55.832
you can express your inner energy.

28:55.867 --> 28:58.468
You can manifest sort
of like the divine?

28:58.503 --> 29:00.369
Correct.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.171
Ah, thank you very for all this.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.273
It's really, really amazing.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.209
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.044
But do you mind
if I go get a cup of

29:08.079 --> 29:09.145
hot chocolate or something?

29:09.180 --> 29:10.413
It's alright with you?

29:10.448 --> 29:12.181
That's perfect to me.

29:12.217 --> 29:13.716
Right, let's go.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.285
That was more than impressive.

29:16.321 --> 29:21.491
That was a Buddhist Tantrayana
master who has learned through

29:21.526 --> 29:26.028
years of practice to tap
into a source of power within

29:26.798 --> 29:31.200
himself and doesn't think
of himself as special.

29:31.236 --> 29:33.469
He says it's his Buddha nature,

29:33.505 --> 29:36.806
A divine power that we all have.

29:36.841 --> 29:39.208
We just have to find it.

29:39.244 --> 29:43.346
I like that idea, that there
is proof of god in all of us,

29:45.550 --> 29:49.352
if we're willing
to look for it.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.522
Buddhists believe tummo
can help them harness

29:52.557 --> 29:55.725
a divine inner power.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.667
In southwestern African,
there is an ancient people who

30:04.702 --> 30:08.704
believe they find proof of god
by harnessing the power of

30:08.740 --> 30:12.742
ancestor spirits and
using it to cure the sick.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.880
Namibian academic,
Ndapelwei Feni Nakanyete,

30:17.916 --> 30:21.117
has been traveling for days
to reach a remote village in

30:21.152 --> 30:23.753
Namibia where this rare
healing ceremony is about

30:23.788 --> 30:26.489
to take place.

30:32.597 --> 30:34.197
Hello.

30:34.232 --> 30:35.565
Hello.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.267
Welcome to the village.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.169
Thank you so much.

30:40.205 --> 30:44.740
Leon Semhow is a member
of the San tribe.

30:44.776 --> 30:48.344
The San are one of the
oldest communities on earth.

30:49.647 --> 30:51.547
It's estimated that they've
been performing their

30:51.583 --> 30:55.718
traditional healing trance
dance for 20,000 years.

30:59.624 --> 31:02.191
I understand that San people

31:02.227 --> 31:05.394
have quite a complex religion.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.763
So these people,
it's not going to church.

31:07.799 --> 31:11.701
They just know
that there's god.

31:12.103 --> 31:15.504
Our people also
connect to their ancestors,

31:15.540 --> 31:19.175
people that die
a long time ago.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.844
Some of them will come
back as a bad spirit and

31:21.880 --> 31:25.214
some of them will
come as a good spirit,

31:25.483 --> 31:30.486
that is help them chasing
the bad spirit away.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.555
So you mean that there is a

31:32.590 --> 31:36.392
god that protects the
San people and then there are

31:36.427 --> 31:39.161
ancestors that heal the people.

31:39.197 --> 31:40.329
Yeah, exactly.

31:40.365 --> 31:43.132
We have people
that we call healers.

31:43.167 --> 31:47.837
And those connect to
their ancestors who die

31:47.872 --> 31:51.374
a long time ago.

31:51.809 --> 31:54.477
The San see physical
pain and illness as

31:54.512 --> 31:59.282
proof that evil spirits
have invaded their bodies.

32:01.452 --> 32:05.288
Village healers use a trance
dance to summon good spirits

32:05.323 --> 32:09.025
that they believe
will cure the sick.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.769
This is the Jarub song
and if you're doing

32:19.804 --> 32:24.573
the [inaudible] songs, you
have to start with their song.

32:25.376 --> 32:28.110
Where ever you see
people doing this,

32:28.146 --> 32:30.479
it's when someone is sick.

32:30.515 --> 32:32.181
Among those
hoping for relief on this

32:32.216 --> 32:36.118
night is Busa Klam Kumta.

32:36.154 --> 32:39.322
She's been suffering
from leg pains for days.

32:40.925 --> 32:44.360
The singing, clapping
and dancing will send the

32:44.395 --> 32:48.164
San healer, a village
elder named Kunta Boo,

32:48.199 --> 32:52.234
into a trance state.

32:52.770 --> 32:55.371
That's when the good spirits
of his ancestors will possess

32:55.406 --> 32:59.308
him so he can heal Busa.

32:59.344 --> 33:02.678
So the more he likes the song,

33:02.714 --> 33:04.747
the quicker he will trance?

33:04.782 --> 33:06.382
Yeah, yeah.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.651
Interesting.

33:09.620 --> 33:12.321
For the San, when
the healer enters the

33:12.357 --> 33:16.459
trance, they get a glimpse
into the world of the divine.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.877
He's now in trance and

33:34.912 --> 33:38.047
he's healing people.

33:39.684 --> 33:43.586
A person is the only
way you can heal.

33:43.621 --> 33:46.222
Meaning he is connected to

33:46.257 --> 33:48.724
the ancestor and the
ancestor are leading him and

33:48.760 --> 33:50.793
where to touch.

33:50.828 --> 33:52.395
Yeah.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.496
And where to heal.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.797
And what to do.

33:54.832 --> 33:56.098
And what to do.

33:56.134 --> 33:59.702
Yeah.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.514
This is real.

34:12.550 --> 34:17.286
It's not just singing
and doing something else.

34:17.321 --> 34:21.090
He is healing people.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.330
The dance won't end
and the healer won't

34:28.366 --> 34:33.168
be himself until he's chased
away the evil spirits.

34:34.871 --> 34:37.606
The next morning, Feni has
returned to the village to see

34:37.641 --> 34:41.277
if the spirits did
in fact help Busa.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.380
I have never ever in my life

34:45.416 --> 34:49.518
seen something like that before.

34:49.554 --> 34:52.388
Busa, you were one
of the people that were

34:52.422 --> 34:54.389
healed last night.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.692
How are you doing today?

35:04.235 --> 35:06.435
I was actually suffering
from back

35:06.471 --> 35:08.838
pains and my legs.

35:08.873 --> 35:11.640
But this morning when
I was doing everything,

35:11.676 --> 35:15.144
it was feeling very good.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.447
Your legs are now fine,

35:18.483 --> 35:22.218
your back pain is gone.

35:22.253 --> 35:25.454
And I hope it doesn't
come back any more.

35:28.159 --> 35:30.726
The Sans see proof of
the divine in the

35:30.761 --> 35:34.763
healing power of their
medicine men and perhaps on

35:34.799 --> 35:38.267
some level the healing works
because of that belief

35:38.302 --> 35:41.637
in a divine connection.

35:42.106 --> 35:45.174
Which raises an
interesting question.

35:45.209 --> 35:49.311
To find proof, do we need faith?

35:52.250 --> 35:55.451
For many religions,
channeling the divine is their

35:55.486 --> 35:58.220
proof of god.

35:58.256 --> 36:03.259
But for another faith,
the proof is in god's words.

36:07.431 --> 36:10.499
I have always had
a thirst for knowledge.

36:10.535 --> 36:13.669
Still read everything
I can get my hands on.

36:13.704 --> 36:16.872
This instinct to learn
about our world and try to

36:16.908 --> 36:19.642
understand it is universal.

36:19.677 --> 36:25.147
Civilization itself is based
on our drive for knowledge.

36:26.417 --> 36:32.454
But does that knowledge bring
us closer to proof of god?

36:32.490 --> 36:35.624
The answer to that may depend
on whether you believe the

36:35.660 --> 36:41.797
words we write come from
our minds or from god.

36:42.934 --> 36:46.569
All of the world's major
religions have a sacred text.

36:46.604 --> 36:50.573
The Sikhs have a book called
The Guru Granth Sahib.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.511
The Jewish faith has the Torah.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.448
Both offer divine wisdom
to their followers.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.395
I'm at the Islamic center
in Washington DC to see

37:13.431 --> 37:17.066
how the words of the Koran
are more than holy wisdom

37:17.101 --> 37:19.235
for the Muslim faithful.

37:19.270 --> 37:22.271
They are proof of god.

37:25.142 --> 37:30.312
Dr. Amir Hussein is a scholar
of the Islamic tradition.

37:32.516 --> 37:33.582
Amir?

37:33.618 --> 37:34.817
Mr. Freeman, honored to see you sir.

37:34.852 --> 37:36.285
How are you?

37:36.320 --> 37:37.686
Thank you.

37:37.722 --> 37:41.156
I'm very well indeed,
nice to see you.

37:41.192 --> 37:44.727
This is rather elaborate...

37:45.129 --> 37:47.563
so the first thing that
occurred to me when I walked

37:47.598 --> 37:51.867
in here was, "I wonder
what that chandelier weighs?"

37:51.902 --> 37:53.736
It’s huge.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.138
There's a verse in the Koran
about god is the light of the

37:56.173 --> 37:58.274
heavens and the earth.

37:58.309 --> 38:02.244
Now up there,
what are we looking at?

38:02.280 --> 38:05.681
What you see are verses
from the Koran.

38:05.716 --> 38:09.685
So right here up in the
light, this Malhar, Al-Rahman,

38:09.720 --> 38:12.521
Al-Raheem literally in the
Name of god, the merciful,

38:12.556 --> 38:14.123
The compassionate.

38:14.158 --> 38:15.457
Al-Rahman, merciful.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.459
Al-Raheem, the compassionate.

38:17.495 --> 38:20.329
So those are two
of the names of god.

38:20.364 --> 38:23.632
So, then calligraphy has a special

38:23.668 --> 38:25.801
place and meaning?

38:25.836 --> 38:28.270
Absolutely.

38:28.306 --> 38:32.174
To make beauty out of those
letters, out of those words,

38:32.209 --> 38:34.176
is really important for Muslims.

38:34.211 --> 38:37.446
You know, through the
words that god speaks.

38:37.481 --> 38:40.349
For Christians, god's
word is the Bible.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.685
But gods word really is Jesus.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.687
You know, god to come
to earth in the flesh.

38:44.722 --> 38:48.557
For Muslims, the Koran is
god come to earth in a book.

38:48.592 --> 38:51.860
So the very words of the
Koran are the words of god.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.697
Proof of god is the Koran.

38:54.732 --> 38:56.265
Is the Koran.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.100
The fact that it exists.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.635
Absolutely that it exists,

38:59.670 --> 39:02.638
that god reveals god's self
to human beings in these words.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.506
And in these words in Arabic,

39:04.542 --> 39:06.442
80% of Muslims don't
use Arabic as their

39:06.477 --> 39:08.110
day to day language.

39:08.145 --> 39:12.381
But the words of the Koran
are always in Arabic.

39:24.795 --> 39:27.096
In the mosque courtyard,

39:27.131 --> 39:31.200
Amir shows me verses
that every Muslim knows,

39:31.235 --> 39:35.671
ones that explain how god
shows himself in the Koran.

39:35.706 --> 39:39.241
So these are the very first
words of the Koran,

39:39.276 --> 39:41.577
the first versus
revealed to the prophet.

39:41.612 --> 39:43.112
Is that right there?

39:43.147 --> 39:44.646
Right there.

39:44.682 --> 39:46.882
Saying Bismillah, Al-Rahman,
Al-Raheem, in the name of god,

39:46.917 --> 39:48.684
the merciful, the compassionate.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.453
Recite in the name of your lord.

39:51.489 --> 39:55.557
And then here, recite your
lord is the most generous who

39:55.593 --> 39:57.793
taught by the pen.

39:57.828 --> 40:01.697
Taught the human being what
the human being did not know.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.733
That's the crucial importance
here, that god teaches us,

40:04.769 --> 40:08.771
but god teaches us with god's
pen and that's why the pen,

40:08.806 --> 40:12.875
the writing, the calligraphy
is so important for Muslims.

40:14.178 --> 40:18.480
We have, very fortunately,
one of the great calligraphers

40:18.516 --> 40:21.517
in the Islamic world, the
best American calligrapher,

40:21.552 --> 40:23.819
Mohamed Zakariya, who's with us here.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.821
Let's come down and meet him.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.222
Brother Mohamed...

40:31.195 --> 40:32.928
I want to introduce
you to Mr. Morgan Freeman.

40:32.963 --> 40:33.829
How do you do, sir?

40:33.864 --> 40:35.464
What a delight.

40:35.499 --> 40:36.698
You're an American?

40:36.734 --> 40:37.866
Pale face.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.234
Pale.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.235
California boy.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.638
You won't get paler than me.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.173
But you've taken up this very

40:44.208 --> 40:45.507
interesting art.

40:45.543 --> 40:46.942
Yeah, I was a machinist,

40:46.977 --> 40:48.177
I was a precisionist.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.846
When we're doing calligraphy,
we're talking about making a

40:50.881 --> 40:56.185
line by eye that is within
half a thousandth of an inch,

40:56.220 --> 40:58.454
deviation from good and bad.

40:58.489 --> 41:01.557
And so I saw these
calligraphies and they were

41:01.592 --> 41:03.859
kind of an inspiration
to me at the time and I

41:03.894 --> 41:05.527
converted to Islam.

41:05.563 --> 41:08.197
Is it possible to see your studio,

41:08.232 --> 41:09.465
where you work?

41:09.500 --> 41:12.367
Absolutely, I invite you.

41:19.176 --> 41:24.713
It would seem to me that
that takes enormous

41:24.748 --> 41:29.351
concentration to make a line
and take a breath and continue

41:29.386 --> 41:33.222
that line without showing
you where I took the breath.

41:33.257 --> 41:36.658
The thing is, as your pen is moving,

41:36.694 --> 41:41.163
you can actually forget
what you're doing.

41:41.198 --> 41:45.267
There's a rhythm,
the whole thing flows and

41:45.302 --> 41:50.339
it becomes visual music in a sense.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.277
Okay, so what does that part mean?

41:55.312 --> 41:56.612
What does it say?

41:56.647 --> 41:58.080
Yeah.

41:58.115 --> 41:59.882
"Whoever does a work based on what

41:59.917 --> 42:01.717
he knows from his knowledge,

42:01.752 --> 42:04.086
god causes him
to inherit a knowledge

42:04.121 --> 42:08.390
that he didn't know he had"
and so that's a famous one.

42:08.425 --> 42:10.626
Ah yes, I love that.

42:10.661 --> 42:12.761
It’s one of the few lines that I’ve

42:12.796 --> 42:15.230
ever written that I really
think that has that flow.

42:15.266 --> 42:16.865
Life.

42:16.901 --> 42:18.367
Yeah.

42:18.402 --> 42:20.269
Otherwise, it's just writing.

42:20.304 --> 42:21.803
It just sits there, you know?

42:21.839 --> 42:23.505
It's the difference
between, well you know,

42:23.541 --> 42:25.774
a good hot dog
and a great hot dog.

42:27.711 --> 42:30.479
That is not just good, Mohamed...

42:30.514 --> 42:34.483
this is awesome.

42:45.930 --> 42:51.533
For Muslims, the Koran is the
holy revelation of god's word.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.336
And so the very existence
of the words of the Koran

42:54.371 --> 42:56.672
is proof of god.

42:56.707 --> 43:00.542
Drawing these words has
become a high form of art,

43:00.578 --> 43:05.814
a way to invoke the presence
of god and all who gaze at them.

43:07.384 --> 43:10.652
No matter which
language you speak.

43:13.290 --> 43:16.792
For most of reported history,

43:17.328 --> 43:21.430
our knowledge was
connected to religion.

43:21.465 --> 43:24.633
But today, religion
often seems at odds with

43:24.668 --> 43:27.836
another way of understanding
the world, science.

43:29.506 --> 43:33.375
Some even see science
as supplanting faith.

43:33.410 --> 43:35.844
Physicists discovered
the god particle,

43:35.879 --> 43:40.449
so do we still need god?

43:42.219 --> 43:45.420
I'm meeting with theoretical
physicist Art Leween at the

43:45.456 --> 43:48.190
New York Botanical Garden.

43:48.225 --> 43:51.393
He thinks science doesn't
replace god, instead,

43:51.428 --> 43:55.664
it leads us to him.

43:55.699 --> 44:00.335
So, you're a theoretical
physicist, Art.

44:00.371 --> 44:02.371
Why do you want to meet
me in this place?

44:02.406 --> 44:05.107
Well, I thought it would
help us talk about god.

44:06.844 --> 44:08.710
Well, let me show you this...

44:08.746 --> 44:10.612
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

44:10.648 --> 44:15.884
How does plant life and
a theoretical physicist

44:15.919 --> 44:17.886
get us to god?

44:17.921 --> 44:19.388
Let me show you this leaf.

44:19.423 --> 44:21.423
Okay, so it's beautiful.

44:21.458 --> 44:23.558
Yeah, it is.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.360
And there's something
about looking at

44:25.396 --> 44:28.296
nature that makes us
sense awe and wonder,

44:28.332 --> 44:30.866
something beyond ourselves.

44:30.901 --> 44:33.135
Any of us can look at this
and we sense something of

44:33.170 --> 44:34.836
the beauty of nature.

44:34.872 --> 44:40.575
and I think that beauty
points us towards god.

44:49.253 --> 44:52.654
Well you know there's a
widespread sense that as

44:52.690 --> 44:55.857
scientists discover more and
more about the natural world,

44:55.893 --> 44:57.759
you're kind of taking
away the wonder and

44:57.795 --> 44:59.695
taking away the awe.

44:59.730 --> 45:01.663
Right, if you can explain it...

45:01.699 --> 45:04.499
you don't need god
creating it, right?

45:04.535 --> 45:06.468
Yeah, well I think
it's the other way around.

45:06.503 --> 45:12.541
So I think the more we
learn about the world,

45:12.576 --> 45:15.410
it points more towards
god, rather than less.

45:15.446 --> 45:17.446
But as a physicist you deal in

45:17.481 --> 45:19.481
photons and equations.

45:19.516 --> 45:21.383
Where's the god in that?

45:21.418 --> 45:24.386
Well I do think
mathematics is as beautiful as

45:24.421 --> 45:26.888
any nature scene that
you see around you,

45:26.924 --> 45:29.658
possibly some are
even more beautiful.

45:29.693 --> 45:32.127
Let me give you an example.

45:32.429 --> 45:35.397
So this is the Dirac equation.

45:35.432 --> 45:37.165
That's the Dirac equation?

45:37.201 --> 45:38.667
That’s right.

45:38.702 --> 45:41.770
And so Paul Dirac, a very
famous mathematical physicist

45:41.805 --> 45:45.240
was thinking about what happens
when very small things,

45:45.275 --> 45:48.243
described by quantum
mechanics, go very fast,

45:48.278 --> 45:50.378
described by Einstein's relativity.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.914
He put these things together
and you get this equation.

45:52.950 --> 45:55.650
And what's amazing about
this equation is that it

45:55.686 --> 45:58.520
predicted the existence of
antimatter well before we

45:58.555 --> 46:00.222
saw it in nature.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.390
So the mathematics, as it were,

46:02.426 --> 46:04.860
forced the natural world
to have antimatter and

46:04.895 --> 46:06.128
it was by...

46:07.731 --> 46:10.398
It's amazing and this piece,

46:10.434 --> 46:12.100
this really beautiful little equation,

46:12.136 --> 46:15.203
has discovered antimatter
in it, right there.

46:15.239 --> 46:17.472
Dirac’s mathematical insight revealed

46:17.508 --> 46:20.408
hidden aspects of the universe...

46:22.312 --> 46:25.180
and helped us understand the Big Bang,

46:25.215 --> 46:27.249
its moment of creation.

46:27.284 --> 46:28.750
Okay, so Dirac did this?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.285
Yeah.

46:30.320 --> 46:31.520
What did you want to do?

46:31.555 --> 46:33.822
Well I wanted to discover
an equation like this

46:33.857 --> 46:37.592
that maybe describes
what life is.

46:37.628 --> 46:43.298
So if you do find this equation,

46:43.333 --> 46:45.534
do you think that
would be proof of god?

46:45.569 --> 46:48.804
It’s important
to remember what god is.

46:48.839 --> 46:50.639
God is not a thing out there
in the universe

46:50.674 --> 46:52.174
that we look for.

46:52.209 --> 46:54.543
It's the other way around.

46:54.578 --> 46:57.846
God is the reason why
there is a universe.

46:57.881 --> 47:00.081
So that means I can't prove
god the way I can prove

47:00.117 --> 47:02.284
something scientifically.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.652
But let me give you an example.

47:03.687 --> 47:05.854
When I married my wife,
if I say to her,

47:05.889 --> 47:09.291
"look, I don't believe
that you love me until you

47:09.326 --> 47:11.827
give me evidence to the contrary."

47:11.862 --> 47:15.864
So instead what I
have to do is I have

47:15.899 --> 47:20.335
to take a step of faith and
believe that she loves me.

47:20.370 --> 47:23.104
As I get to know
my wife better,

47:23.140 --> 47:26.174
our love grows and
my confidence that she

47:26.210 --> 47:28.143
loves me grows.

47:28.178 --> 47:31.379
In the same way, as I
get to know god better,

47:31.415 --> 47:36.284
my confidence that god exists grows.

47:46.530 --> 47:50.298
That was a fascinating conversation.

47:50.334 --> 47:52.634
Too many people think of
science and faith as two

47:52.669 --> 47:57.539
opposing world views,
each trying to tear the

47:57.574 --> 48:00.041
other one down.

48:00.544 --> 48:03.211
But nothing can be
further from the truth.

48:03.247 --> 48:07.249
Art believes that you can find
god in scientific knowledge.

48:07.284 --> 48:11.286
The deeper he goes, the
more he sees science of god.

48:11.655 --> 48:13.788
I mean after all the
very fact that we were here

48:13.824 --> 48:16.057
asking these questions
is miraculous.

48:17.694 --> 48:21.596
So why not take that leap of faith?

48:28.772 --> 48:32.340
We've spent thousands of years
searching for proof of god.

48:34.578 --> 48:38.747
Some feel his presence
guiding them through life.

48:39.149 --> 48:41.516
Others believe they can
channel the divine through

48:41.551 --> 48:44.319
their bodies.

48:44.621 --> 48:49.491
Or see him in the intricate
wonder of the universe.

48:52.529 --> 48:55.897
So much in our world has
changed from the world our

48:55.933 --> 48:59.701
ancestors lived in.

49:00.103 --> 49:04.272
When we first began to think
about god and began to look

49:04.308 --> 49:09.177
for proof of him, but how
much has changed really?

49:10.480 --> 49:14.182
Yes, we have vast amounts
of scientific knowledge and

49:14.217 --> 49:17.786
it's tempting to think
that we may one day try to

49:17.821 --> 49:21.790
use that knowledge
to prove or disprove god.

49:23.460 --> 49:28.129
But we're still all
just sitting here,

49:28.165 --> 49:32.400
surrounded by creation,
amazed at its complexity,

49:34.237 --> 49:37.806
its scope, its beauty.

49:39.376 --> 49:41.843
We will always yearn to make
sense of the seemingly

49:41.878 --> 49:45.847
chance events that guide
the course of our lives and

49:45.882 --> 49:49.818
we will still, I believe,
be faced with the gap between

49:49.853 --> 49:52.253
knowledge and doubt.
