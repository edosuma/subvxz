WEBVTT

00:33.308 --> 00:36.211
<i>Hey, Dave, is Leo, tried your cell,</i>

00:36.245 --> 00:37.780
<i>didn't see you guys today,
but good news,</i>

00:37.814 --> 00:40.382
<i>Judge Ramsey's getting
us that warrant.</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:42.351
<i>Looks like a bust for Monday. Call me back.</i>

00:42.384 --> 00:43.318
<i>Later.</i>

00:51.293 --> 00:53.061
Jack, what are you doing here?

00:53.095 --> 00:54.797
The neighbor called,
said he heard gunshots.

00:54.831 --> 00:57.534
We headed straight over.
Make sure Dave is okay.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.736
Roger.

01:01.169 --> 01:03.305
John,
this is not what it looks like.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.410
What exactly does
this look like, Jack?

01:10.212 --> 01:12.515
Here.

01:12.549 --> 01:15.450
- Isn't this your wife?
- Yes, yes, this is my wife.

01:19.522 --> 01:21.223
I'm going to need you
to step aside, Jack.

03:05.962 --> 03:06.863
Um...

03:09.297 --> 03:13.268
Hi. Look, I'm sorry, but, um,
that's my tree.

03:16.005 --> 03:18.206
Um, funny...

03:19.976 --> 03:21.343
I don't see your name on it.

03:22.979 --> 03:25.682
It's just that's my study spot.
It took me a long time

03:25.715 --> 03:28.417
to find the right tree with,
you know,

03:28.450 --> 03:30.887
- enough shade and a great view.
- It's a great view.

03:33.355 --> 03:35.558
Okay, I tell you what,
I will give you this spot...

03:36.693 --> 03:37.760
if I can take you to dinner.

03:41.764 --> 03:43.465
Okay, sure.

03:43.499 --> 03:45.868
Yeah? Alright.

03:48.671 --> 03:49.872
- Thank you.
- Hm-mm.

04:09.492 --> 04:11.994
Okay, creating false memories...

04:12.028 --> 04:13.462
D.

04:14.997 --> 04:18.366
- Wait, what?
- The answer is D.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.805
Wait,
how do you know the answer is D?

04:22.839 --> 04:25.608
And you said you were
going to give me this tree.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.744
Technically I said I was
going to give you that spot.

04:29.612 --> 04:32.849
- It's Grace's psych class, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:33.750 --> 04:37.019
There are so many reasons
for false memory.

04:38.521 --> 04:42.390
Hypnosis, age regression,
chemical imbalance.

04:43.526 --> 04:45.061
It's always D.

04:45.094 --> 04:45.995
All the above.

04:49.431 --> 04:51.333
- So you want to be a sidekick?
- Hey!

04:51.366 --> 04:53.301
My dad is actually a nurse too
and just because we don't have

04:53.335 --> 04:54.971
PhDs, it doesn't make us
any less important.

04:55.004 --> 04:57.372
Whoa!
I did not mean to strike a nerve.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.041
Uh-huh, yeah.

04:59.075 --> 05:01.677
- Besides, every hero needs some help.
- Not Superman.

05:02.678 --> 05:06.015
Well, my mom is pretty super.
What about your family?

05:08.484 --> 05:10.318
The only thing
my dad ever taught me

05:10.352 --> 05:12.054
was to never be like him.

05:13.489 --> 05:15.423
It was my mom

05:15.457 --> 05:18.060
who showed me there are things
in life worth fighting for.

05:20.563 --> 05:22.498
So is that why you're
studying criminal law?

05:25.134 --> 05:28.037
Let me guess. Matlock or McCoy?

05:30.039 --> 05:32.608
- I didn't realize that you, uh...
- What?

05:33.776 --> 05:37.013
Nothing. It's just you, uh...

05:37.046 --> 05:40.016
you look really good
for your age.

05:40.049 --> 05:43.351
Come on, haven't
you ever heard of reruns?

05:44.086 --> 05:46.656
- Uh.
- My dad and I love those old lawyer shows.

05:46.689 --> 05:49.692
Okay, well, I'm sorry to disappoint.
I will not be in the court room.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.795
I will be on the streets putting
the baddies behind bars.

05:52.829 --> 05:54.831
Okay, so, like <i>The Dark Knight.</i>

05:54.864 --> 05:56.899
No, Batman is a vigilante!

05:56.933 --> 05:59.367
The end does not
justify the means.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.771
Well, you did just give a girl

06:01.804 --> 06:05.074
the test answers so that she would
walk to the cafe with you, so...

06:05.107 --> 06:07.610
Okay, well, I can't help it
if I have a good memory.

06:07.643 --> 06:12.982
Okay, so you are
a mash-up of Batman,

06:13.015 --> 06:15.417
Matlock and Mr. Monk.

06:15.450 --> 06:17.687
Yeah, you're not good at this
whole comparison thing, are you?

06:17.720 --> 06:20.957
Well, I mean you did start
by calling me a sidekick, so...

06:20.990 --> 06:23.659
I will try to keep
my foot out of my mouth

06:23.693 --> 06:24.794
for the rest of the night.

06:25.695 --> 06:27.964
Well, I'd say
your odds are pretty good,

06:27.997 --> 06:29.966
because I'm meeting
some girls inside.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.435
Wha... wha... what about, uh...

06:35.437 --> 06:37.139
Dinner.

06:37.173 --> 06:41.110
- Technically I said you could take me to dinner.
- Mm.

06:42.078 --> 06:43.546
And here we are.

06:45.715 --> 06:48.517
Okay. Well, can I at least
have your number?

06:50.086 --> 06:52.420
I thought you were the world's
greatest detective.

06:53.923 --> 06:55.992
Yeah, but I don't even
have your name.

06:56.025 --> 06:57.493
Figure it out, Batlock.

07:01.831 --> 07:04.967
Okay.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.743
- Jack.
- What?

07:13.776 --> 07:17.613
That's my name. Jack.
Jack Cluff, not Batlock.

07:17.647 --> 07:19.548
I want to know your name.
I want to know your number.

07:19.582 --> 07:21.150
And I want to take you
to dinner, and not

07:21.183 --> 07:24.053
dinner here like, a real dinner.

07:24.086 --> 07:25.855
Batlock,
are you asking me on a date?

07:25.888 --> 07:27.990
It's Jack!

07:28.024 --> 07:32.628
It's Jack. And, yeah, I am.
Will you go on a date with?

07:35.264 --> 07:38.134
Or coffee. Coffee's fine too.

07:41.971 --> 07:42.972
Your phone.

07:53.149 --> 07:54.150
Bye, Jack.

07:56.585 --> 07:59.188
<i>Hello, you've reached Beth.
Sorry, I can't answer.</i>

07:59.221 --> 08:01.190
<i>But your call is so,
so important to me.</i>

08:01.223 --> 08:05.261
<i>Please, leave a message and I
will call you back. Thanks. Bye.</i>

08:07.530 --> 08:08.864
- Hey.
- Here is your coffee.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.714
Okay, mister. Quiz time.

08:26.749 --> 08:30.252
So, tell me,
what are the four loves?

08:32.154 --> 08:35.591
First love is
what the Greeks called <i>storge.</i>

08:35.624 --> 08:37.927
The family bond.
And the second love

08:37.960 --> 08:41.130
is called <i>philia.</i>
The friendship bond.

08:41.163 --> 08:42.798
Thanks.

08:42.832 --> 08:45.001
<i>And what's the third love?</i>

08:45.034 --> 08:47.603
<i>Eros, the erotic love.</i>

08:47.636 --> 08:51.674
<i>It's that tingle
in your fingertips,</i>

08:51.707 --> 08:53.142
<i>that weakness in your knees.</i>

08:53.175 --> 08:55.945
- Hi!
- Hi!

08:55.978 --> 08:57.913
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.984
Merry Christmas.

09:05.254 --> 09:06.989
- Amen.
- Amen.

09:15.698 --> 09:18.768
<i>What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?</i>

09:18.801 --> 09:21.637
<i>You want the moon? Just say
the word and I'll throw</i>

09:21.670 --> 09:23.839
<i>a lasso around it
and pull it down.</i>

09:23.873 --> 09:25.141
<i>Hey, that's a pretty good idea.</i>

09:26.542 --> 09:31.080
- <i>I'll give you the moon, Mary.</i>
- <i>I'll take it. Then what?</i>

09:31.113 --> 09:33.582
<i>From the moment I saw you,</i>

09:33.616 --> 09:35.217
<i>I knew I wanted to know
everything about you.</i>

09:36.185 --> 09:37.720
<i>Watching you with your family,</i>

09:38.954 --> 09:40.656
<i>with your friends,</i>

09:40.689 --> 09:43.025
<i>you have shown me
what love looks like.</i>

09:45.694 --> 09:49.999
<i>So I commit my life,
and my heart, and my love...</i>

09:51.167 --> 09:53.335
<i>...to you. And to you alone.</i>

10:03.245 --> 10:06.715
<i>I join my life
to yours in this moment.</i>

10:08.350 --> 10:10.152
<i>Until time stops.</i>

10:17.993 --> 10:21.630
As we strive ever toward
that fourth love,

10:22.665 --> 10:24.834
I take you to be my wife.

10:26.102 --> 10:30.072
It gives me great pleasure to
pronounce you husband and wife.

10:30.106 --> 10:31.340
You may kiss your bride.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.150
Okay, here we go.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.151
This is it.

10:44.286 --> 10:45.888
<i>Jack Thomas Cluff...</i>

10:48.257 --> 10:51.093
<i>it's amazing how quickly
you've become my best friend.</i>

10:55.965 --> 11:00.402
<i>I take you as my husband
and my partner in crime.</i>

11:04.173 --> 11:07.843
<i>I love how you cheer me up
when my world is falling apart.</i>

11:10.112 --> 11:13.749
<i>You bring me coffee
just to say I love you.</i>

11:16.385 --> 11:17.753
<i>Though life may change,</i>

11:18.821 --> 11:20.923
<i>know that I will
always be by your side.</i>

11:22.892 --> 11:26.162
<i>I give to you my heart, my soul,</i>

11:27.229 --> 11:30.833
<i>my all... to be yours alone.</i>

11:33.068 --> 11:34.870
<i>Now and forevermore.</i>

12:37.099 --> 12:40.903
- Yeah, wondering if Jesse's home.
- Jesse who?

12:40.936 --> 12:43.305
- He doesn't live here.
- Yeah, well, uh,

12:43.339 --> 12:45.107
you know,
that's his car out there.

12:47.876 --> 12:49.044
Look, lady, I've got a warrant.

12:49.078 --> 12:50.913
You can't just barge in here.

12:56.486 --> 12:58.521
Oh! Damn!

13:08.998 --> 13:10.966
- Drop the gun, Jesse.
- Stay back!

13:11.000 --> 13:12.801
Whoa, Jesse,
we just want to talk!

13:22.044 --> 13:23.779
Ah! Hey!

13:24.913 --> 13:27.316
I got the right to carry, man.
It was self-defense.

13:30.085 --> 13:32.955
- Yeah, got a right to carry this?
- It's not mine.

13:32.988 --> 13:36.859
Assault with a deadly weapon,
possession of illegal substances.

13:36.892 --> 13:38.561
How about we take
a little ride downtown?

13:38.595 --> 13:41.163
Hey! This isn't a warrant!

13:45.635 --> 13:47.469
Nah, man, I'm not going back.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.040
- Ah!
- With a record like yours,

13:51.073 --> 13:52.941
I don't know,
it doesn't look very pretty.

13:52.975 --> 13:56.145
But there's a way out of this,
Jesse, you know that, right?

13:56.178 --> 13:57.112
Hey, look at me.

13:58.113 --> 14:00.449
Sometimes in life
we're giving second chances.

14:02.151 --> 14:03.520
What we do
with them is up to us.

14:57.339 --> 14:58.508
Small blind, people.

14:58.541 --> 15:00.042
Yeah, I like to mix the cards.

15:03.112 --> 15:04.647
Hi, everyone,
you need to go home?

15:12.254 --> 15:13.623
He is good, check him out.

15:13.656 --> 15:15.257
You guys are late.

15:15.290 --> 15:19.261
Hey, yeah, not too late.
You can still deal us in.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.163
Next time, you're out.

15:21.196 --> 15:24.133
Blame this guy.
The lucky bastard had to go and score.

15:24.166 --> 15:25.602
It's not luck, it's skill.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.506
Shotguns only hold five rounds.

15:30.439 --> 15:36.412
Now, let's guy beer.
We, uh, got our third witness today.

15:36.445 --> 15:40.449
Now all we need is a warrant.
We got ourselves a bust.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.120
Sure, but no matter
how fast we bring them in,

15:45.154 --> 15:46.689
there's always more.

15:46.723 --> 15:49.091
They say the Yaku are in
on the game now.

15:50.660 --> 15:52.961
Next thing you know,
it'll be gang wars.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.430
Bastards.

15:54.463 --> 15:55.665
Dealers are nothing.

15:57.366 --> 16:00.169
We cut off the heads
before the war begins.

16:00.202 --> 16:03.439
Come on guys,
give the rookie a break.

16:03.472 --> 16:05.140
He's earned a name for himself.

16:05.174 --> 16:07.176
Looks like you're earning
more than that, rookie.

16:17.587 --> 16:20.022
Small blind. Big blinds.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.326
Watch out for Dave.

16:25.294 --> 16:26.462
He does what he has
to do to win.

16:29.599 --> 16:34.169
Well, I fold.
It's just a game right.

16:34.203 --> 16:36.071
Come on, Roger,
you telling on me?

16:38.775 --> 16:40.477
You know,
I got your back, right, Jack?

16:51.186 --> 16:52.522
Hey, guys,
give me just a second.

17:00.563 --> 17:03.165
- Hey, baby, what's up?
- Hey,

17:03.198 --> 17:04.701
sorry, I know you're off grid.

17:04.734 --> 17:07.102
I just I wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

17:08.771 --> 17:11.173
- What was that?
- Nothing, the guys just get

17:11.206 --> 17:13.242
kind of rowdy
when they are playing poker.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.445
Poker, huh?

17:19.181 --> 17:20.717
- Beth, look...
- Is Dave dominating again?

17:20.750 --> 17:22.719
He seems to be doing
that a lot lately.

17:22.752 --> 17:24.721
You know how the guys are,
this is just their way

17:24.754 --> 17:27.490
- of bonding and I...
- And you're the rookie, right.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.792
Look, we knew it was
going to be like this.

17:29.826 --> 17:31.694
I'm new to the team.

17:31.728 --> 17:34.463
People would kill
for a shot like this.

17:34.497 --> 17:36.198
This is how the guys
build trust.

17:36.231 --> 17:38.166
It's not just a game. It's work.

17:41.838 --> 17:44.807
Well, then have fun at work,
Jack. I have to go.

17:44.841 --> 17:45.742
Beth!

17:53.616 --> 17:55.250
Jack, come on, man!

18:05.528 --> 18:06.428
You're up?

18:07.362 --> 18:10.165
Alright, let's do this.

18:21.878 --> 18:24.279
Come on!

18:24.313 --> 18:26.148
Here, let me.

18:30.385 --> 18:32.589
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

18:32.622 --> 18:36.391
<i>Dr. Manny to surgery
two, please. Dr. Manny, surgery two.</i>

18:36.425 --> 18:38.293
Great work tonight, Beth.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.662
You are your mother's daughter.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.436
<i>...which
corresponded to a report of shots</i>

18:47.469 --> 18:49.906
<i>fired on the west side
around 10:30 p.m.</i>

18:49.939 --> 18:53.509
<i>On arriving at the scene,
the officers came under heavy fire.</i>

18:53.543 --> 18:55.243
<i>No officers were harmed,</i>

18:55.277 --> 18:57.647
<i>but the suspect
managed to escape.</i>

18:57.680 --> 18:59.649
<i>Upon further investigation...</i>

18:59.682 --> 19:02.417
- You all right?
- Yeah, Mom. Be careful, it's really hot.

19:02.451 --> 19:04.621
<i>No further
information at this time.</i>

19:05.788 --> 19:08.457
No, I mean...

19:10.927 --> 19:13.362
Dr. Manny said
you seemed a little...

19:13.395 --> 19:16.566
Emotional? At least
someone's paying attention.

19:18.367 --> 19:19.434
Is it Jack?

19:20.770 --> 19:24.774
He's trying to make
detective and I get it,

19:24.807 --> 19:27.877
- but it's...
- Tomorrow's your anniversary.

19:30.713 --> 19:35.217
You know, believe it or not, our
marriage wasn't always perfect.

19:37.219 --> 19:40.757
- Med school was tough.
- What did you do?

19:41.691 --> 19:44.894
We had to make the decision
each day to trust each other...

19:46.428 --> 19:50.265
to love... even when
we didn't feel like it.

19:53.368 --> 19:55.571
Jack loves you,
even if he doesn't

19:55.605 --> 19:57.372
always take the time to show it.

19:58.340 --> 19:59.609
How can you be sure?

20:01.544 --> 20:03.311
That's why they call it trust.

20:18.293 --> 20:20.663
<i>Three more have been
found dead in the gang related shooting</i>

20:20.697 --> 20:21.864
<i>over what authorities believe</i>

20:21.898 --> 20:23.633
<i>to be a new drug from Japan.</i>

20:23.666 --> 20:25.535
<i>They're calling it "reaver,"
and as of now,</i>

20:25.568 --> 20:27.503
<i>it's full effects are unknown.</i>

20:27.537 --> 20:29.672
<i>Some say the Japanese gang,
the Yaku,</i>

20:29.706 --> 20:32.675
<i>may be responsible for
the emergence of this new drug.</i>

20:32.709 --> 20:34.977
<i>This, when coupled
with a rise in violent crime,</i>

20:35.011 --> 20:37.814
<i>has many worried for
the safety of our streets.</i>

21:33.069 --> 21:36.939
<i>...have been identified
as members of the Manos Coltellos</i>

21:36.973 --> 21:39.842
<i>again dealing primarily
with narcotics.</i>

21:39.876 --> 21:42.779
<i>Authorities speculate this to be
yet another violent message</i>

21:42.812 --> 21:44.714
<i>from an unknown rival gang,</i>

21:44.747 --> 21:47.483
<i>possibly a battle
over territory rights.</i>

21:47.517 --> 21:49.451
<i>The police are doing
everything they can</i>

21:49.485 --> 21:52.522
<i>to find those responsible
and bring them to justice.</i>

21:52.555 --> 21:54.991
<i>According to the BGA,
the dreaded gang war</i>

21:55.024 --> 21:58.094
<i>is now at an unprecedented
level in the city.</i>

21:58.127 --> 22:00.462
<i>The Manos Coltellos will retaliate...</i>

22:00.496 --> 22:02.464
<i>...it's only a question of...</i>

22:27.690 --> 22:30.458
I am saying a little bit of fun,
a little bit of action is not that bad.

22:30.493 --> 22:32.528
She's hot. She is eating out
of the palm of your hand.

22:32.562 --> 22:34.630
It's not going to happen. Okay?

22:34.664 --> 22:36.666
What... what... well,
what's wrong?

22:36.699 --> 22:37.733
She is not your type?

22:40.736 --> 22:42.470
My father was the biggest
disappointment of my life.

22:42.505 --> 22:45.407
I do not plan on being
that for someone else.

22:48.978 --> 22:50.680
Yeah, and how many times
I tell you not to wear

22:50.713 --> 22:51.814
that thing in the street?

22:53.182 --> 22:55.151
Someone sees that, they're going
to know you got a heart and then

22:55.184 --> 22:56.752
they going to tear
your heart out.

23:39.762 --> 23:41.097
You know, I was married once.

23:43.966 --> 23:46.669
I didn't take you
for the marrying type.

23:46.702 --> 23:48.237
Yeah, neither did she.

23:52.108 --> 23:53.109
So what happened?

23:56.779 --> 24:00.049
I thought we were in it
together. Partners.

24:00.950 --> 24:03.819
She was going for prosecutor,
I was going for the badge.

24:03.853 --> 24:04.854
Law and order.

24:06.555 --> 24:08.925
Well, turns out she didn't
really like law school.

24:10.593 --> 24:12.628
Uh, what she really
liked was traveling.

24:13.796 --> 24:16.899
You know, she wanted
experiences, travel the world.

24:16.933 --> 24:20.069
I couldn't really afford
that on a beat cop's salary.

24:20.102 --> 24:21.103
Tell me about it.

24:22.939 --> 24:25.207
Beth keeps wanting
to go to Hawaii.

24:28.044 --> 24:30.079
I'm just putting off
talking about it.

24:33.015 --> 24:35.718
All my old lady ever
wanted to do was talk.

24:35.751 --> 24:36.986
What she didn't do was listen.

24:39.855 --> 24:42.892
Anyway. One day I...

24:42.925 --> 24:45.828
came home, empty house.

24:45.861 --> 24:46.729
Divorce papers.

24:55.604 --> 24:59.575
- I'm sorry, Dave.
- Oh, no, don't be sorry.

25:01.811 --> 25:03.846
Letting her go was the best
decision I've ever made.

25:06.282 --> 25:07.950
I mean, if your old lady
doesn't listen to you,

25:07.984 --> 25:09.485
then she doesn't respect you.

25:10.953 --> 25:12.521
And then you're in trouble.

25:12.555 --> 25:14.123
You got to find a partner
you can trust.

25:15.624 --> 25:16.859
Somebody who's got your back.

25:26.602 --> 25:29.205
- What's up?
- One of my contacts.

25:36.078 --> 25:37.980
Where are we going?
We got our witnesses.

25:40.049 --> 25:41.183
We got a new lead.

26:18.754 --> 26:19.989
Hi, how are you doing?

26:23.859 --> 26:24.760
Just two.

26:34.804 --> 26:36.005
So what are we doing here?

26:36.906 --> 26:38.607
Well, I'm about you,
but I'm fixing to have

26:38.641 --> 26:39.842
a nice hot cup of tea.

26:53.889 --> 26:57.860
- This isn't your usual crowd.
- You are right, Jack.

26:57.893 --> 27:00.763
But you know what they say
about desperate times.

27:07.803 --> 27:08.904
The Yaku, Jack.

27:10.206 --> 27:12.241
That's out of our jurisdiction.

27:12.274 --> 27:14.643
They deal in arms trafficking,
prostitution, not narc...

27:14.677 --> 27:15.611
Narcotics?

27:17.046 --> 27:18.714
Didn't you hear what Leo said?

27:21.784 --> 27:23.919
Or were you too distracted?

27:40.836 --> 27:41.904
Focus, Jack.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.199
Why have you come?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.202
Do you speak English?

28:23.829 --> 28:25.831
You came to me. This is my house.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.421
Hell with this.

28:33.689 --> 28:35.958
- Manos Coltellos. Does that mean anything?
- Dave, she doesn't

28:35.991 --> 28:37.494
- speak English.
- They're tired of your nips

28:37.527 --> 28:39.261
- moving around the market.
- She doesn't understand...

28:39.295 --> 28:42.031
Shut up, Jack. Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

28:42.064 --> 28:43.899
Coltellos want me
to send a message.

28:48.237 --> 28:51.407
But... they're old news.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.044
And the Yaku use a little bit
of help expanding their markets.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.365
Amane?

29:01.241 --> 29:02.659
Is there a problem?

29:06.997 --> 29:07.998
No Problem.

29:09.041 --> 29:10.042
Just business.

29:21.971 --> 29:22.871
Amane?

29:25.374 --> 29:30.246
That is your name? The Yaku
have a very bright future here.

29:32.181 --> 29:34.817
You just got to know
how to play the cards right.

29:34.850 --> 29:37.953
We know the city. We could be
the ace up your sleeve.

29:37.987 --> 29:39.388
Dave, come on. Let's go.

29:43.158 --> 29:47.329
Well, Dave. Looks like Jack
does want to play this game.

29:47.363 --> 29:50.399
He'll come around.

29:55.538 --> 29:57.239
What the hell was that?

29:57.273 --> 29:59.842
- It's called a bluff.
- This isn't poker, Dave.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.844
Come on, Jack.
This isn't training day.

30:02.878 --> 30:04.880
This job is risk.
And if you can't handle that,

30:04.913 --> 30:06.282
you should have been
off the team a long time.

30:06.315 --> 30:08.450
No, you left me in the dark.

30:08.485 --> 30:10.252
We were supposed to have
each other's backs, right?

30:10.286 --> 30:11.987
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,
rookie.

30:12.021 --> 30:14.456
We're partners,
what we do we do it together

30:14.491 --> 30:15.958
or we don't do it at all.

30:15.991 --> 30:17.793
This isn't busting dealers,
Jack.

30:18.495 --> 30:20.597
This is the big leagues
and you need to keep up.

30:20.630 --> 30:22.231
The Yaku messed up.
They're making enemies,

30:22.264 --> 30:23.600
and there's a gang war
on the streets,

30:23.633 --> 30:26.101
and we have
a chance to stop that.

30:26.135 --> 30:29.171
We play this right,
we could topple a crime empire.

30:31.006 --> 30:33.208
All their other trafficking,
they've had deniability.

30:33.242 --> 30:35.344
Generations
of covering their tracks,

30:35.377 --> 30:37.547
but they're new to narcotics
and that's our game.

30:42.151 --> 30:43.185
So what do we do?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.589
We tell the team?
We get back-up?

30:48.924 --> 30:49.825
No.

30:51.494 --> 30:53.563
- The team is built on trust.
- Well, now our team is built

30:53.596 --> 30:55.898
on trust, Jack, you and me.

30:55.931 --> 30:57.534
It's what you asked for.

30:57.567 --> 30:59.536
I did not sign up for this.

30:59.569 --> 31:01.470
You signed up for this when
you joined the dope team, Jack.

31:01.504 --> 31:03.038
We broke protocol.

31:04.373 --> 31:06.475
We went in there
without a warrant.

31:06.509 --> 31:08.478
We went in there
without a motive.

31:08.511 --> 31:10.446
- We didn't have anything.
- And we tell the rest of the team

31:10.480 --> 31:12.147
and they'll all be liable.

31:12.181 --> 31:14.883
- We're going to get our facts.
- Your contact.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.953
Maintains anonymity and
deniability. That's the deal.

31:20.490 --> 31:22.525
You want to be a hero, Jack?
This is how you do it.

31:24.126 --> 31:26.395
You take the dirt
so nobody else has to.

31:28.665 --> 31:31.233
You can walk home right now
and leave this all behind.

31:32.401 --> 31:34.169
Or you can make
a difference to city.

31:37.940 --> 31:39.241
Have you got my back or not?

31:41.977 --> 31:42.878
Yeah.

31:44.614 --> 31:45.648
I've got your back.

31:47.416 --> 31:48.384
Good.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.020
Good. Alright, now,

31:52.054 --> 31:55.692
let's loosen up.
It's been a tense day.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.472
You doing alright.
You doing alright.

32:43.506 --> 32:45.274
I'm just trying to keep up,
alright?

32:45.307 --> 32:47.042
- We'll see you there at the strip club.
- What?

32:47.075 --> 32:49.579
- Wait, where are you going?
- Don't be late.

32:49.612 --> 32:52.014
We're all going
to the Boom Boom Club.

32:52.047 --> 32:56.452
No, I have to go. I told
Beth I'd be home an hour ago.

32:56.486 --> 32:58.621
Mrs. C,
she's not going to miss you.

32:58.655 --> 33:00.590
Come on.
First lap dance is on me.

33:02.324 --> 33:04.326
- Come on. I got dollars.
- No, stop, stop.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.629
Alright. Oh, here.

33:08.565 --> 33:10.533
Just pick me up in the morning.
Think fast!

33:12.468 --> 33:13.469
Thank you.

33:16.472 --> 33:19.609
- Alright, you guys have fun now.
- Goodnight, Jackey!

33:37.694 --> 33:38.728
Hello, Jack.

33:40.797 --> 33:41.698
Hi.

33:43.131 --> 33:44.099
Where were you?

33:46.335 --> 33:47.236
I was out.

33:49.338 --> 33:51.440
I thought that you said
you'd be home at 10:00.

33:56.445 --> 33:57.346
Look.

33:59.114 --> 34:02.585
I know that your work
is unpredictable, but...

34:04.787 --> 34:06.689
- today was...
- Today was a very long day.

34:06.723 --> 34:08.525
Today was our anniversary.

34:13.630 --> 34:15.832
For months now,

34:15.865 --> 34:18.801
I've been patient,
I've been supportive.

34:19.769 --> 34:21.436
I haven't known
when you're coming home,

34:21.470 --> 34:24.239
if you're ever coming home
and I spent

34:24.273 --> 34:26.174
the entire night
preparing us this meal.

34:26.208 --> 34:29.077
And all I asked was
when you would be home

34:29.111 --> 34:31.446
and then you show up late,
and are you drunk off

34:31.481 --> 34:33.816
- of your ass?
- Maybe if you had just told me all of that

34:33.850 --> 34:35.450
instead of being
all coy about it...

34:35.485 --> 34:37.487
Okay, no, no,
today is our anniversary.

34:37.520 --> 34:42.090
Do you have any idea...

34:43.425 --> 34:46.461
- what my day has been like?
- No!

34:46.496 --> 34:48.363
Because we don't ever talk.

34:48.397 --> 34:51.333
I can't tell you what I do,
Beth, because every time

34:51.366 --> 34:54.202
I go out that door,
my life is in danger,

34:54.236 --> 34:58.641
so I have to keep everything a secret
and I do that to keep you safe.

34:58.675 --> 35:00.342
I do that for you.

35:00.375 --> 35:02.645
No, you do it for you.
You do it so you can be

35:02.679 --> 35:04.581
like some kind of hero!

35:04.614 --> 35:06.516
Maybe I do it because I want
to get a little bit of respect.

35:09.519 --> 35:11.721
Because I certainly
do not get that from you.

35:17.594 --> 35:18.861
Go to hell, Jack Cluff.

35:20.262 --> 35:22.397
- Well, where are you going?
- I'm going to work.

35:23.633 --> 35:26.268
Well, you said you wanted to
talk, right, Beth? So let's talk!

35:27.670 --> 35:29.772
Listen to me
when I'm talking to you.

35:37.680 --> 35:38.848
Well, I guess you were wrong.

35:41.718 --> 35:45.420
It looks like you've turned out
exactly like your father,

35:45.454 --> 35:46.589
Mr. Cluff.

35:50.627 --> 35:53.763
Beth. Beth!

36:09.879 --> 36:11.146
Please.

36:12.414 --> 36:14.817
Please, just give me Jack back.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.588
Please.

36:23.593 --> 36:28.230
"Go to hell, Jack."
"Just like your dad, huh, Jack?"

36:40.242 --> 36:41.343
Hey, Dave.

36:43.713 --> 36:45.581
Where are you guys at?

36:53.623 --> 36:56.659
It certainly like
sleeping under my truck...

37:02.364 --> 37:03.933
Two for those guys.

37:03.966 --> 37:05.668
It starts raining.

37:11.339 --> 37:13.275
- Hold on.
- What?

37:13.308 --> 37:15.578
I have to see a friend.

37:15.611 --> 37:18.948
What? You were just telling
a story. You can't...

37:18.981 --> 37:21.416
Come on, man.

37:21.450 --> 37:22.451
Have fun!

37:31.994 --> 37:33.629
For you and your friend.

37:37.734 --> 37:38.768
Thank you.

37:40.937 --> 37:42.337
Dave.

37:46.341 --> 37:47.744
Oh, look, look who is here.

39:00.650 --> 39:03.418
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Jack, it's Roger.</i>

39:03.451 --> 39:05.688
- <i>You doing okay?</i>
- Uh.

39:05.721 --> 39:08.691
Yeah, sorry, man,
I guess I just... I, uh...

39:10.425 --> 39:12.394
- I overslept.
- <i>Well, that warrant</i>

39:12.427 --> 39:14.396
<i>for the McPherson house
came in over the weekend.</i>

39:14.429 --> 39:16.933
<i>Careful of Leo. He's pretty
pissed at you and Dave.</i>

39:16.966 --> 39:20.069
- Why?
- <i>We haven't heard from you guys since Thursday.</i>

39:20.102 --> 39:22.370
Jeez,

39:22.404 --> 39:25.107
- talk about separation anxiety.
- <i>Jack,</i>

39:25.141 --> 39:28.343
- <i>you've been off the grid all weekend.</i>
- Uh-huh, very funny.

39:32.548 --> 39:33.783
What?

39:35.585 --> 39:39.454
<i>Hey, you reached Dave.
Leave a message and if I feel like it,</i>

39:39.488 --> 39:41.157
<i>I'll call you back. Later.</i>

39:41.190 --> 39:42.792
What the hell, Dave?

40:17.827 --> 40:20.029
- <i>Hey you, this is Dave.</i>
- Where are you, Dave?

40:20.062 --> 40:22.665
- Where are you?
- <i>Looks like you missed me. Leave a message or...</i>

41:29.999 --> 41:32.868
<i>You have two unheard messages.</i>

41:34.303 --> 41:36.038
<i>Hey, Dave, it's Leo,
tried your cell.</i>

41:36.072 --> 41:37.907
<i>Didn't see you guys today,
but good news,</i>

41:37.940 --> 41:40.042
<i>Judge Ramsey's getting us
that warrant.</i>

41:40.076 --> 41:43.012
<i>Looks like a bust for Monday.
Call me back. Later.</i>

41:45.247 --> 41:48.684
<i>Dave. I did it.</i>

41:48.718 --> 41:49.618
<i>I finally did it.</i>

41:49.652 --> 41:50.886
<i>I left Jack.</i>

41:52.822 --> 41:54.557
<i>We had a fight and I'm scared.</i>

41:56.225 --> 41:57.927
<i>I'm scared of Jack.</i>

42:00.329 --> 42:01.597
<i>No, I can't!</i>

42:06.836 --> 42:08.270
<i>I love you, Dave.</i>

42:38.768 --> 42:40.903
Dave!

42:48.711 --> 42:50.146
Police! Is anyone here?

42:56.719 --> 42:59.121
- Jack, what are you doing here?
- The neighbor called,

42:59.155 --> 43:01.257
said he heard gunshots.
We headed straight over.

43:01.290 --> 43:02.758
Make sure your Dave is okay.

43:03.893 --> 43:04.960
Roger.

43:06.062 --> 43:07.930
John, this is not
what it looks like.

43:10.866 --> 43:12.735
What exactly does
this look like, Jack?

43:13.702 --> 43:17.106
- Isn't this your wife?
- Yes, yes, this is my wife.

43:17.139 --> 43:18.808
I'm going to need you
to step aside, Jack.

43:37.494 --> 43:39.929
- <i>Hello, you've reached Beth...</i>
- Come on, Beth!

43:39.962 --> 43:42.665
<i>...sorry...</i>

43:42.698 --> 43:44.266
<i>Hello?</i>

43:44.300 --> 43:45.768
- Shawn!
- <i>Jack!</i>

43:45.801 --> 43:47.970
- Hey! Look.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

43:48.003 --> 43:49.839
- Something's happened, okay?
- <i>Jack.</i>

43:49.872 --> 43:51.307
- I need to find Beth.
- <i>Jack, Beth's gone.</i>

43:51.340 --> 43:53.342
I need to find Beth...

45:21.263 --> 45:22.364
Sunday?

46:00.369 --> 46:01.971
That's why she hires the best.

46:11.146 --> 46:14.016
Not a word. Drive.

46:14.049 --> 46:15.851
Or what?
You are going to shoot me?

46:34.403 --> 46:35.538
So who are you?

46:37.906 --> 46:38.874
Where am I?

46:39.775 --> 46:41.944
That reaver really
did a number on you.

46:43.045 --> 46:44.481
Didn't really affect
your partner.

46:45.548 --> 46:47.016
Says something, doesn't it?

46:47.049 --> 46:48.450
What do you know
about my partner?

46:50.886 --> 46:54.089
I know that lying bastard
got what he deserved.

46:54.123 --> 46:55.324
You kill him?

46:57.026 --> 46:58.460
Watched him bleed out
in front of me.

47:00.429 --> 47:01.864
And you're setting me up?

47:03.299 --> 47:05.000
Well, aren't you perceptive?

47:06.135 --> 47:07.036
Pull in here.

47:21.950 --> 47:22.851
Keys.

47:32.394 --> 47:33.563
And what about the message?

47:35.998 --> 47:37.933
That Beth left.
Was that a plant, too?

47:41.937 --> 47:42.971
Oh, you mean her.

47:44.173 --> 47:45.307
You know, she's a real looker.

47:46.241 --> 47:47.610
It's a shame what we had to do...

47:47.644 --> 47:50.279
What did you do to her?
Where is she?

48:03.192 --> 48:04.193
Oh, shit.

48:17.574 --> 48:18.974
Damn it.

48:26.583 --> 48:28.317
Beth!

48:28.350 --> 48:30.319
Beth!

48:30.352 --> 48:31.654
Beth.

48:44.099 --> 48:49.238
<i>Dear Jack, happy anniversary
to the world's greatest detective.</i>

48:49.271 --> 48:51.106
<i>It feels like just yesterday,</i>

48:51.140 --> 48:55.944
<i>we promised to commit our lives
to each other until time stops.</i>

48:55.978 --> 48:59.948
<i>I wish I could turn back
time to be with you more,</i>

48:59.982 --> 49:02.351
<i>kiss you more,
tell you I love you</i>

49:02.384 --> 49:04.654
<i>a thousand times more.</i>

49:04.687 --> 49:07.956
<i>But the hands on
the clock only move forward,</i>

49:07.990 --> 49:12.060
<i>so I'll just have to say it now,
today and every day.</i>

49:13.061 --> 49:14.129
<i>I love you, Jack.</i>

49:16.165 --> 49:18.333
<i>Striving ever towards
that fourth love.</i>

49:20.436 --> 49:22.971
<i>Love, Beth.</i>

50:09.251 --> 50:11.621
Okay, mister. Quiz time.

50:12.789 --> 50:14.757
- That's why I'm studying.
- Yeah, but if you want to pass

50:14.791 --> 50:16.526
philosophy you got
to know your stuff.

50:18.293 --> 50:22.130
So, tell me.
What are the four loves?

50:25.267 --> 50:28.738
The first love is what
the Greeks called <i>storge.</i>

50:28.771 --> 50:31.808
Uh, it means affection.
It's, um,

50:31.841 --> 50:34.577
it's like, it's like, uh,
what you feel for your mom.

50:35.578 --> 50:38.715
A fondness from familiarity.

50:40.182 --> 50:41.450
A family bond.

50:54.597 --> 50:56.198
- Dave!
- <i>Jack.</i>

50:56.231 --> 50:58.200
- You are alive!
- <i>I hope so.</i>

50:58.233 --> 51:00.335
- I've been trying to reach you, man.
- <i>Oh, you've been trying?</i>

51:00.369 --> 51:02.337
<i>I've called you three times,
amigo.</i>

51:03.640 --> 51:07.142
<i>Jack. What the hell, Jack!</i>

51:07.175 --> 51:10.145
- Saturday.
- <i>Yes, it's Saturday.</i>

51:10.178 --> 51:13.148
<i>Come on, let's go! I'm in your
driveway. Get your ass out here.</i>

51:14.149 --> 51:16.786
<i>We're going to be late.
We've got one shot at this.</i>

51:32.367 --> 51:33.703
Come on, come on, come on.

51:35.270 --> 51:38.273
<i>Hello, you've reached Beth.
Sorry, I can't answer.</i>

51:40.342 --> 51:42.712
<i>Please, leave a message
and I will call you back.</i>

51:42.745 --> 51:44.146
<i>Thanks, bye!</i>

51:59.261 --> 52:00.563
Took you long enough.

52:00.597 --> 52:02.632
When is the last time
you saw Beth?

52:02.665 --> 52:04.834
- Mrs. C? I don't know.
- Think, Dave!

52:04.867 --> 52:07.269
When is the last time
that you saw her?

52:07.302 --> 52:09.371
I don't see your wife!

52:09.404 --> 52:11.841
Damn, man. What the hell?

52:11.874 --> 52:14.644
Have you been using? I mean you
look worse than you did yesterday.

52:17.714 --> 52:21.249
Look, man,
I know you're all spooked,

52:21.283 --> 52:23.753
but there's nothing to worry
about. You heard Ronin.

52:23.786 --> 52:25.488
He is going to take us
to the top.

52:25.521 --> 52:26.889
All we got to do
is get some evidence,

52:26.923 --> 52:30.258
we get a warrant and boom!
We nail them.

52:30.292 --> 52:31.393
What if it's a trap?

52:33.496 --> 52:36.365
Come on Jack.
If they believed us

52:36.398 --> 52:38.668
there is nothing
to worry about, we're fine.

52:38.701 --> 52:41.336
Look, they're not going to kill
insiders from Coltellos.

52:42.337 --> 52:45.708
And if they don't believe us,
hey, we're cops.

52:45.742 --> 52:47.877
They're not going to have the whole
department coming down on them.

52:47.910 --> 52:49.579
Either way, we're safe.

52:49.612 --> 52:52.180
Yes, I just... I think...

52:52.214 --> 52:54.249
Wait, wait, what? What?
You got a bad feeling?

52:56.552 --> 52:59.321
That is why we take precautions.

53:08.230 --> 53:09.666
This is when you cross the line,
rookie.

53:10.967 --> 53:12.568
When little boys become men.

53:40.697 --> 53:41.831
Yeah.

53:41.864 --> 53:44.701
Oops, forgot that one, didn't I?

54:10.693 --> 54:12.929
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys!

54:12.962 --> 54:14.797
I'm just going to have
a little puff.

54:20.703 --> 54:21.704
Anybody got lighter?

54:31.914 --> 54:33.483
I find it takes the edge off.

54:35.785 --> 54:36.686
Anybody?

54:38.554 --> 54:40.490
No? Your loss.

54:43.425 --> 54:46.461
If they smoked on duty,
it certainly will be their loss.

54:46.496 --> 54:48.831
Amane. Ronin.

54:48.865 --> 54:50.733
Dave. May I?

54:58.674 --> 55:00.810
Jack, you don't look so good.

55:18.928 --> 55:19.929
Ane-san?

55:33.643 --> 55:35.778
If you are
from the Manos Coltellos,

55:36.946 --> 55:38.481
what can you do for me?

55:39.414 --> 55:41.584
What we bring
to the table is experience.

55:43.019 --> 55:44.319
We know this city.

55:45.488 --> 55:47.990
Right now, you're at the edge
of a war for the streets.

55:48.024 --> 55:50.358
We could be the difference
for you in that war.

56:03.438 --> 56:05.708
The Ane-san would like to know
why she should trust you.

56:06.642 --> 56:08.978
A man who has obviously
not worked in drug trafficking,

56:10.680 --> 56:12.148
and a man who is a traitor.

56:12.181 --> 56:14.382
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

56:15.985 --> 56:17.820
Wait, wait just a second.

56:37.106 --> 56:39.609
Here,
we honor loyalty and trust,

56:41.110 --> 56:44.180
but why should I trust men
whose loyalty comes at a price?

56:44.213 --> 56:46.414
I told you it's a trap.

56:46.448 --> 56:48.718
Hey, hey!

56:49.819 --> 56:51.587
Ronin, you said we had a deal!

56:53.089 --> 56:55.124
You will tell us the truth.

56:55.157 --> 56:57.860
- What it costs your partner is up to you.
- Dave...

56:57.894 --> 57:01.564
I told the truth! Listen,
we work for Manos Coltellos.

57:02.832 --> 57:04.901
We thought we could help the Yaku
and make a little extra cash.

57:04.934 --> 57:06.535
- That's it.
- Dave!

57:11.207 --> 57:13.142
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop!

57:13.175 --> 57:14.543
Please, look...

57:15.477 --> 57:16.579
we're cops!

57:17.980 --> 57:19.515
We've been investigating
the Yaku's

57:19.548 --> 57:21.217
recent involvement in narcotics.

57:21.250 --> 57:23.052
We got back-up waiting
right outside.

57:29.926 --> 57:32.161
I said we wanted the truth,
Dave.

58:04.927 --> 58:05.962
Amane!

58:19.575 --> 58:21.711
It was a trap!
We should have had a plan.

58:21.744 --> 58:24.280
It's okay, Jack.
We've got what we need.

58:24.313 --> 58:25.915
What the hell! Come on!

58:45.167 --> 58:48.904
Dave, come on, man! I got you.
Come on. Come on, man.

58:48.938 --> 58:51.741
The evidence!

58:51.774 --> 58:54.143
- Dave, no, we have to get out.
- Jack, go!

58:54.176 --> 58:56.812
As long as you have that
they are not going to kill me.

58:56.846 --> 58:57.747
Go!

59:30.146 --> 59:31.814
You're a real piece of shit.

59:32.948 --> 59:35.051
- Your partner know that?
- Don't get...

59:35.084 --> 59:36.919
don't get righteous on me.

59:38.821 --> 59:39.955
You and me, Ronin?

59:41.023 --> 59:42.858
We are the same.

59:45.061 --> 59:46.896
We both do what we have
to do to survive.

59:49.932 --> 59:51.967
No, Dave, we are not.

59:53.736 --> 59:54.837
I am not a traitor.

1:00:00.843 --> 1:00:02.845
You know, I almost feel
sorry for your partner.

1:00:04.914 --> 1:00:08.317
He has no idea what
you've gotten him into.

1:00:10.386 --> 1:00:11.954
No, hold on!

1:00:24.133 --> 1:00:27.636
And the second
love is called <i>philia.</i>

1:00:28.671 --> 1:00:30.072
And it's the friendship bond.

1:00:36.278 --> 1:00:38.047
It's being there for each other.

1:00:39.014 --> 1:00:40.850
<i>Having each other's backs.</i>

1:00:42.818 --> 1:00:43.986
<i>No matter what.</i>

1:01:41.477 --> 1:01:43.179
<i>Hello, you've reached Beth.</i>

1:01:47.183 --> 1:01:49.351
Hello?

1:01:49.385 --> 1:01:51.720
- <i>Jack.</i>
- Patty. Thank God.

1:01:51.754 --> 1:01:54.023
Look, I got...
I got nowhere else to go.

1:01:54.056 --> 1:01:56.792
- I got nobody else to call.
- <i>Beth said the same thing last night.</i>

1:01:56.825 --> 1:01:59.929
You've seen Beth? Look,
she's in danger. I lost her.

1:01:59.962 --> 1:02:02.765
I don't know how, I don't
know when, I've tried

1:02:02.798 --> 1:02:06.068
- for days and now, and now Dave...
- <i>Dave?</i>

1:02:08.270 --> 1:02:09.271
<i>Jack, what was that?</i>

1:02:11.106 --> 1:02:12.107
<i>Jack?</i>

1:02:13.943 --> 1:02:14.843
<i>Jack?</i>

1:02:48.811 --> 1:02:49.979
Dr. Robinson.

1:02:51.046 --> 1:02:52.448
Dr. Robinson!

1:02:54.450 --> 1:02:55.384
Sir.

1:02:57.052 --> 1:02:58.354
Beth.

1:02:58.387 --> 1:02:59.888
I'm going to need some help!

1:03:04.494 --> 1:03:06.929
Relax, just relax.
Here we go, okay.

1:03:31.987 --> 1:03:34.023
- Where is Beth?
- Beth's fine.

1:03:34.056 --> 1:03:35.525
I spoke to her just
a few minutes ago.

1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:39.529
What is wrong with me?

1:03:40.896 --> 1:03:42.298
Besides being a jackass?

1:03:44.199 --> 1:03:46.536
No, the headaches
and everything.

1:03:48.070 --> 1:03:49.004
I don't know.

1:03:50.239 --> 1:03:53.208
Maybe it's the lingering effects
of a high-potency narcotic.

1:03:53.242 --> 1:03:55.210
Beth said you were
too committed to the job.

1:03:55.244 --> 1:03:56.145
What?

1:04:00.550 --> 1:04:03.185
What is this? LSD? Meth?

1:04:03.218 --> 1:04:05.488
No, this is
something entirely new.

1:04:09.158 --> 1:04:10.125
Reaver.

1:04:11.327 --> 1:04:12.861
- What?
- The... the club... I...

1:04:16.031 --> 1:04:17.567
Have you ever heard
of a drug that alters

1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:19.134
your experience of time?

1:04:20.670 --> 1:04:22.037
Not experience.

1:04:23.038 --> 1:04:25.341
- Perception possibly.
- Perception.

1:04:25.374 --> 1:04:27.876
It could make you
feel disoriented,

1:04:27.910 --> 1:04:30.312
like your memories are
out of order, maybe even

1:04:30.346 --> 1:04:33.315
create false memories, but
that's it. They're memories.

1:04:34.383 --> 1:04:36.051
You can't change
what's happened.

1:04:38.253 --> 1:04:40.155
What is going on with you, Jack?

1:04:40.189 --> 1:04:41.558
I don't know, Patty.

1:04:43.493 --> 1:04:45.961
The last three days

1:04:45.994 --> 1:04:47.530
- drug...
- Not just the last three days.

1:04:50.099 --> 1:04:52.034
I feel like I've tried so hard.

1:04:56.138 --> 1:04:57.906
Now I think
I've really lost her.

1:05:01.977 --> 1:05:03.045
Not yet.

1:05:29.471 --> 1:05:32.307
Beth, honey. Um,
I'm going to run some errands.

1:05:32.341 --> 1:05:33.610
You going to be okay?

1:05:34.677 --> 1:05:36.111
Yeah, dad, I'll be fine.

1:05:37.413 --> 1:05:39.047
Sweetie.

1:06:25.227 --> 1:06:27.664
And, uh, what's the third love?

1:06:30.265 --> 1:06:33.302
<i>Eros, the erotic love.</i>

1:06:34.236 --> 1:06:35.705
It's that, um...

1:06:38.106 --> 1:06:40.042
That tingle in your fingertips.

1:06:42.311 --> 1:06:44.146
That weakness in your knees.

1:06:46.716 --> 1:06:49.017
<i>That passion in your heart.</i>

1:06:51.588 --> 1:06:53.455
<i>That kind of love
that chains two people</i>

1:06:53.490 --> 1:06:55.692
<i>together in ways that move them</i>

1:06:56.659 --> 1:06:59.194
<i>to do great...</i>

1:07:00.429 --> 1:07:02.431
<i>or terrible things.</i>

1:07:29.224 --> 1:07:31.326
Oh! No!

1:07:51.614 --> 1:07:53.248
<i>Hello, you've reached Beth.</i>

1:07:53.282 --> 1:07:55.083
<i>Sorry, I can't answer,
but your call</i>

1:07:55.117 --> 1:07:57.587
<i>is so, so important to me.
Please, leave a message</i>

1:07:57.620 --> 1:07:59.856
<i>and I will call you back.
Thanks. Bye.</i>

1:07:59.889 --> 1:08:01.491
I left Jack.

1:08:03.258 --> 1:08:07.429
We had a fight and I'm scared.
I'm scared of Jack.

1:08:09.164 --> 1:08:12.200
No, I can't, I can't,
I can't. I...

1:08:17.507 --> 1:08:18.641
I love you, Dave.

1:08:25.515 --> 1:08:27.149
Jack, it's a setup!
Jack, it was a trap!

1:08:40.797 --> 1:08:43.633
- I have what you want.
- So you took my phone, too.

1:08:45.267 --> 1:08:48.705
- I want my wife back.
- You don't get to make demands here, Jack.

1:08:48.738 --> 1:08:50.305
Jack!

1:08:53.676 --> 1:08:58.514
October 22nd,
1112 Crestview Lane.

1:09:00.415 --> 1:09:02.552
Where did you
get that information?

1:09:02.585 --> 1:09:03.753
I have a lot more than that.

1:09:05.021 --> 1:09:07.490
And all I have to do is text
over a picture of this manifest

1:09:07.523 --> 1:09:09.892
to my friends, add that
to you letting me escape

1:09:09.926 --> 1:09:12.160
and I'm guessing
that things are not

1:09:12.194 --> 1:09:13.930
looking too good for you, Ronin.

1:09:13.963 --> 1:09:15.832
What if your wife's
already dead?

1:09:17.199 --> 1:09:18.668
Have you thought
about that, Jack?

1:09:20.903 --> 1:09:22.672
Then your life is over,
and I won't be

1:09:22.705 --> 1:09:23.906
the one to pull the trigger.

1:09:36.819 --> 1:09:38.420
Your husband is a risk-taker.

1:09:41.924 --> 1:09:44.226
But he's gambling
with the wrong man.

1:09:49.966 --> 1:09:51.400
Call me back.

1:09:56.438 --> 1:09:57.406
Call me back.

1:10:02.979 --> 1:10:04.279
Come on!

1:10:04.312 --> 1:10:06.916
No! No!

1:10:06.949 --> 1:10:08.518
Come on, man!

1:10:08.551 --> 1:10:09.585
Why?

1:10:10.620 --> 1:10:11.754
Why!

1:10:20.429 --> 1:10:22.230
<i>Hello, you've reached Beth.</i>

1:11:07.076 --> 1:11:08.443
Oh, come on!

1:11:10.913 --> 1:11:14.517
- Everything alright?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1:11:14.550 --> 1:11:16.919
It's just
this stupid coffee maker.

1:11:16.953 --> 1:11:21.557
Yeah, they can
sometimes be a little finicky.

1:11:28.698 --> 1:11:30.967
- Thank you.
- No worries.

1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.400
Take it easy, Mrs. C.

1:11:48.551 --> 1:11:50.418
Think fast.

1:11:50.452 --> 1:11:52.955
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
- I'm out, Dave.

1:11:52.989 --> 1:11:54.957
- Out, what do you mean out?
- Out.

1:11:54.991 --> 1:11:56.793
I tried to change tomorrow.

1:11:56.826 --> 1:11:59.061
I couldn't.
So I'm changing today.

1:11:59.095 --> 1:12:00.596
But Jack, get a grip.

1:12:00.630 --> 1:12:01.864
Everything's going
according to plan.

1:12:01.898 --> 1:12:02.999
Yeah, it is.

1:12:03.032 --> 1:12:04.466
But it's not your plan anymore,

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:06.869
okay, Dave? It's my plan.

1:12:06.903 --> 1:12:09.371
I got a wife, man.

1:12:09.404 --> 1:12:11.841
And it's time I start
thinking about her.

1:12:14.977 --> 1:12:17.480
Mrs. C? Your wife?

1:12:20.917 --> 1:12:22.585
You've seen her lately?

1:12:27.156 --> 1:12:29.659
What... what are you doing, Dave?

1:12:29.692 --> 1:12:31.928
You're in too deep
to just walk away, Jack.

1:12:37.099 --> 1:12:38.634
Things are going my way.

1:12:55.952 --> 1:12:57.854
Mm. No.

1:13:07.029 --> 1:13:07.997
Dave.

1:13:10.666 --> 1:13:12.802
Why are you doing this?

1:13:12.835 --> 1:13:14.770
That's what I love about you,
Jack.

1:13:14.804 --> 1:13:17.472
Always looking for the best
in other people.

1:13:17.506 --> 1:13:20.943
You know, the police aren't the only
ones that want the Yaku out of business.

1:13:20.977 --> 1:13:23.613
That whole, enemy of my enemies
is my friends thing?

1:13:23.646 --> 1:13:25.615
We're going to be heroes
and we're going to make

1:13:25.648 --> 1:13:27.750
my friends very happy
along the way.

1:13:28.885 --> 1:13:30.119
And nobody's going to get hurt.

1:13:38.094 --> 1:13:39.028
Ah!

1:13:40.229 --> 1:13:43.900
Amane has a little friend.

1:13:44.901 --> 1:13:45.968
Nice.

1:13:47.503 --> 1:13:48.638
Here you go.

1:13:59.048 --> 1:14:03.085
Right. Looks like
we have a little leverage.

1:14:05.955 --> 1:14:07.422
Best you look the part.

1:14:08.658 --> 1:14:10.893
I just don't want you getting
too carried away out there.

1:14:16.232 --> 1:14:17.900
You know, my guy
at the hospital better get

1:14:17.934 --> 1:14:21.103
a text every 15 minutes.
And if not...

1:14:35.284 --> 1:14:36.852
Come on, Jack. Let's go.

1:15:11.921 --> 1:15:13.222
Call him off!

1:15:14.323 --> 1:15:15.791
You won't shoot me.

1:15:33.776 --> 1:15:35.745
Don't bluff when I got
the winning hand.

1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:40.016
It's time for you to fold, Jack.

1:15:46.055 --> 1:15:48.190
Oh, man.

1:15:57.366 --> 1:15:59.602
It looks like
you only got 15 minutes.

1:16:33.636 --> 1:16:36.272
<i>Hello, you've reached Beth.
Sorry I can't answer.</i>

1:16:36.305 --> 1:16:39.008
<i>But your call is so,
so important to me.</i>

1:16:39.041 --> 1:16:41.010
- <i>Please, leave a message and I will call you back.</i>
- Shit!

1:16:41.043 --> 1:16:42.578
<i>Thanks, bye!</i>

1:17:43.339 --> 1:17:47.343
And after the past few days,
I know that now.

1:17:47.376 --> 1:17:48.777
I'm sorry.

1:17:53.382 --> 1:17:54.650
Please.

1:17:55.451 --> 1:17:56.785
I can't.

1:18:34.757 --> 1:18:35.858
<i>And the fourth love.</i>

1:18:37.059 --> 1:18:39.695
It's the greatest love of all.

1:18:42.865 --> 1:18:44.433
All the natural loves
are conditional.

1:18:47.036 --> 1:18:48.137
They can be broken.

1:18:52.808 --> 1:18:54.376
But the fourth love
is supernatural.

1:18:58.314 --> 1:19:00.416
It can't be overcome
by anything...

1:19:02.284 --> 1:19:03.419
in this world.

1:19:06.489 --> 1:19:09.024
And it's not based off
of anything you do to earn it.

1:19:11.260 --> 1:19:15.798
It's giving everything you have
and not getting anything back.

1:19:20.903 --> 1:19:22.771
It's giving somebody
a second chance,

1:19:25.508 --> 1:19:27.243
even when they don't deserve it.

1:20:01.477 --> 1:20:02.411
Yeah.
