00:18.101 --> 00:20.311
<i>Stonn clouds gather,</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:22.063
<i>darkness prowls,</i>

00:22.064 --> 00:25.775
<i>the moon shines full
as specters howl.</i>

00:25.776 --> 00:27.735
This scary house,

00:27.736 --> 00:29.654
this lonely road,

00:29.655 --> 00:31.531
revenge is coming

00:31.532 --> 00:34.450
and best served cold.

00:34.451 --> 00:38.412
Revenge on Jeff,
who plays with dolls.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.999
Revenge on Walter,
who moans and scowls.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.836
Peanut, Jose,
shall know their place,

00:45.837 --> 00:48.297
like my awful father,

00:48.298 --> 00:50.383
who scarred my face.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.345
One by one,
they'll learn they're damned

00:54.346 --> 00:58.516
<i>to Minding the Monsters
with Jeff Dunham.</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:50.526
Thank you, Savannah.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.372
Well, this is just awesome.
Thank you, sir.

01:55.373 --> 01:56.740
Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

01:56.741 --> 01:57.832
We are really excited.

01:57.833 --> 01:58.916
I'm really excited.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.912
The guys in the suitcases
are excited.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.295
<i>And this show is called
Minding the Monsters.</i>

02:10.297 --> 02:11.547
Why?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.633
Well, we wanted to do a show
that was different.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.726
I wanted to do something
that I'd never done before.

02:15.727 --> 02:18.061
I've done the standup shows,
I've done the specials,

02:18.062 --> 02:20.103
but I wanted something...
I wanted something scary.

02:20.104 --> 02:22.141
So I said, "Pick a scary city."

02:22.142 --> 02:23.860
And everybody went...

02:32.653 --> 02:33.823
So, you know the answer.

02:33.824 --> 02:35.322
You know why this place
is scary.

02:35.323 --> 02:38.074
There's lots of reasons, but let
me tell the rest of the world.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.992
Savannah is known
for being scary

02:39.993 --> 02:41.290
because you have haunted houses,

02:41.291 --> 02:43.079
you have haunted cemeteries.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.748
Every night there are ghost
tours going around the city.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.588
My ex-wife was born here.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.844
So, we decided what the heck,
we'll do it here.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.141
But why in the world did I want
to do a monster special?

03:01.142 --> 03:02.480
Well, growing up as <i>a...</i>

03:02.481 --> 03:03.940
<i>You know, I always enjoyed
Frankenstein.</i>

03:03.941 --> 03:05.229
<i>I loved Dracula.</i>

03:05.230 --> 03:06.818
<i>I loved The Mummy.
All those monsters.</i>

03:06.819 --> 03:08.938
I loved scaring people,
and I loved being scared.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.814
I think it started
about the age of five.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.031
I was an only child.

03:12.032 --> 03:13.149
<i>Hey, remember the...</i>

03:13.150 --> 03:14.696
Some of you may remember
the cars back then.

03:14.697 --> 03:16.572
The American automobiles
were these huge, giant things.

03:16.573 --> 03:19.115
We didn't have seat belts;
there were no kid seats.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.787
I was an only kid
in the backseat.

03:20.788 --> 03:22.457
These backseats
were eight feet wide,

03:22.458 --> 03:24.662
one big, long bench.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.456
I could run back and forth
on the bench.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.457
On the ﬂoor, the only thing
in the way was the hump.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.084
You'd trip over the hump
if you didn't see it.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.757
The back window, you could lay
in the back window.

03:32.758 --> 03:34.754
I would do that;
it was fantastic.

03:34.755 --> 03:37.007
And I would run around
back there, and when my mother

03:37.008 --> 03:38.724
was driving, she wouldn't
pay any attention to me.

03:38.725 --> 03:40.187
And my mother,
still to this day,

03:40.188 --> 03:42.304
has a big, giant beehive hairdo.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.890
Pretty much Marge Simpson hair,

03:44.891 --> 03:47.017
but not the same color,
you know what I'm saying?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.313
Looks like that.
She also has

03:48.314 --> 03:49.982
these giant curlers
that she uses,

03:49.983 --> 03:51.480
and she put them
all over her hair.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.231
And I remember standing
in the backseat,

03:53.232 --> 03:54.323
and I would look at her hair,

03:54.324 --> 03:55.443
this big,
giant beehive of hairdo,

03:55.444 --> 03:57.153
all held together with Aqua Net.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.832
And these big, giant curlers

04:02.833 --> 04:04.828
would make these holes,
what looked like caves to me.

04:04.829 --> 04:09.373
I imagined they were a maze
of caves in her hair like this.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.250
I remember standing back there,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.503
staring at the hair,

04:12.504 --> 04:15.296
a-and then I looked over
on the seat of the car, and, oh,

04:15.297 --> 04:18.507
there's a little rubber,
plastic spider, a black spider.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.887
This is all true.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.347
I took that black spider,

04:25.348 --> 04:28.100
and I put it right on the edge
of one of the curls.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.518
Fantastic, looked great.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.360
I'm sitting there,
looking at it, and I thought,

04:31.361 --> 04:32.854
"No, that's not good enough."

04:32.855 --> 04:34.822
I found a pencil.
I took the pencil...

04:34.823 --> 04:36.157
She's not paying any attention.

04:36.158 --> 04:38.028
This is all true;
didn't know I was doing this.

04:38.029 --> 04:40.196
And I took that pencil
and ever so gently

04:40.197 --> 04:42.782
pushed it back
to the back of the curl,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.658
deep into the caves of curls.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.702
Gone.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.704
Four days later...

04:50.457 --> 04:53.292
I am not kidding.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.627
Four days later...

04:54.628 --> 04:56.881
My bedroom was right next
to my parents' bathroom.

04:56.882 --> 04:59.465
My mother would comb out
her hair about once a month.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.011
It was four days later;
she's in the bathroom,

05:01.012 --> 05:02.056
combing out her hair.

05:02.057 --> 05:04.762
The blood-curdling scream
that came

05:04.763 --> 05:07.681
when that spider
fell out onto her lap

05:07.682 --> 05:10.059
was worth the beating I took
later that night.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.909
So, as I grew up,

05:20.910 --> 05:23.202
I learned to appreciate
all those monster things,

05:23.203 --> 05:24.907
and then, when I had children,

05:24.908 --> 05:28.494
I taught my children
that scaring and being scared

05:28.495 --> 05:30.579
was a great thing.

05:30.580 --> 05:34.083
My youngest daughter, Kenna,
when she was a little kid,

05:34.084 --> 05:36.919
she was a master
at scaring people.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.591
And when you're scared,
there's one of two things

05:38.592 --> 05:39.803
that happens to you.

05:39.804 --> 05:41.766
You have one
of two emotions usually.

05:41.767 --> 05:43.634
And it's usually fight
or flight.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.303
And you don't know
which one you're gonna do

05:46.304 --> 05:48.347
until you're actually really,
really scared.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.941
And I'd never been really,
really scared

05:49.942 --> 05:52.935
until my daughter
started scaring me.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.937
This little twerp could jump
out of nowhere

05:54.938 --> 05:56.906
in the middle of the darkness
and.

05:56.907 --> 05:58.941
Like,.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.192
And I wasn't a ﬂight.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.070
I didn't scream like a girl
and run away.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.493
I started punching.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.167
The worst was when I was
upstairs in the master bathroom.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.375
I was cleaning a toilet.

06:10.376 --> 06:12.120
I had the plunger;
I was plunging the toilet.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.747
I got finished;
I was walking down the hall,

06:13.748 --> 06:15.123
middle of the night like this.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.297
She jumped out of nowhere.

06:16.298 --> 06:18.627
My first reaction was like,
"Whoa-oh-oh!"

06:18.628 --> 06:21.380
And she's like, "Yay! Dad almost
killed me with a plunger.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.631
Whoo-hoo!"

06:22.632 --> 06:24.633
She's laughing.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.885
That little kid would hide
underneath my desk in my office.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.512
I had a desk that
was fully enclosed.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.980
When you'd sit underneath it, it
was a little cave under there.

06:30.981 --> 06:32.315
She learned to hide under there,

06:32.316 --> 06:33.777
and she would
sit there patiently.

06:33.778 --> 06:35.352
That's what's so evil about it.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.648
She would wait for ten minutes
and then reach out

06:38.649 --> 06:40.816
and grab my legs...
I'd be, like

06:40.817 --> 06:43.903
She eventually learned
to take a pillow with her.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.739
You'd be, like, "Aah!"

06:46.740 --> 06:47.957
What the...? Oh.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.828
Now, as they got older,

06:52.829 --> 06:54.704
I stopped scaring them,
they stopped scaring me,

06:54.705 --> 06:56.172
but eventually,
my daughters and I

06:56.173 --> 06:57.383
figured out that scaring dogs

06:57.384 --> 06:59.376
is a fun thing to do as well.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.671
And one of our
favorite dogs to scare

07:02.672 --> 07:03.924
is my little dog Roadie.

07:03.925 --> 07:06.050
Roadie is a five-pound
miniature pinscher.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.769
And it's great
scaring little dogs,

07:07.770 --> 07:09.845
because they can't
do anything to you.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.597
<i>You know those...</i>

07:11.598 --> 07:14.433
candy bowls at Halloween

07:14.434 --> 07:15.606
that have the...

07:15.607 --> 07:17.686
- hand. <i>..</i>

07:18.855 --> 07:21.357
Don't get ahead of me here.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.702
That have the little rubber hand
that sticks up, when you

07:23.703 --> 07:26.153
reach in to get the candy,
it goes... like this.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.864
First couple of time, I'm, like,
"Oh, oh, that's really funny!

07:28.865 --> 07:31.575
That is not a candy bowl,
that is a dog bowl.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.704
Oh, yeah.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.457
So, I thought this up,
and the girls are at the house.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.799
I'm, like, "Girls, watch this.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.215
This is genius!"
They're, like,

07:41.216 --> 07:42.878
“What are you doing now, Dad?"

07:42.879 --> 07:44.049
I'm "Just watch, this is great!"

07:44.050 --> 07:46.013
I took the candy bowl,
I poured out the candy.

07:46.014 --> 07:48.224
I put a piece of hamburger
in the bottom of the bowl

07:48.225 --> 07:49.559
right in front of the hand.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.848
I put the bowl on the ground.
Roadie comes running in.

07:51.849 --> 07:53.096
They're, like, "Dad,"
they're, like, "Dad."

07:53.097 --> 07:54.393
“Oh, my gosh,
this is hilarious!"

07:54.394 --> 07:55.768
I'm, like, "Shut up,
here she comes."

07:55.769 --> 07:57.267
Roadie comes running in.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.064
She's, like, "Oh, look, there's
a hamburger in the bowl!"

07:59.065 --> 08:00.359
She puts her head in the bowl.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.398
Back of the head!

08:04.526 --> 08:06.068
Roadie's looking around,

08:06.069 --> 08:07.861
like, "What the hell?
Who hit me?

08:07.862 --> 08:09.612
I'm just trying
to get the hamburger."

08:09.613 --> 08:10.866
The girls are, <i>like...</i>

08:12.659 --> 08:13.909
Roadie goes back.

08:15.752 --> 08:17.588
Then she figures out
it's the stupid bowl.

08:17.589 --> 08:19.248
She's pissed at the bowl now,

08:19.249 --> 08:20.794
but she wants to get
the damn hamburger.

08:20.795 --> 08:22.339
Ten minutes later,
she's still trying

08:22.340 --> 08:23.961
to get the frickin' hamburger.

08:32.886 --> 08:36.015
Unfortunately, dogs learn.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.767
To this day, Roadie
will not eat or drink

08:38.768 --> 08:41.770
out of a bowl
that she's never met.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.938
Until she does
her little Army crawl.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.524
She'll be like this.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.777
It's sad, I know. But...

08:48.778 --> 08:51.405
I let Roadie get back at people
after that happened to her.

08:51.406 --> 08:56.243
This past Halloween,
I got a shark outfit for Roadie.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.297
We were shooting
a television show.

08:59.298 --> 09:00.664
I had a dressing room.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.131
Outside the dressing room
was the hallway

09:02.132 --> 09:03.670
where everyone would walk,
and you could

09:03.671 --> 09:04.918
hear 'em coming
around the corner,

09:04.919 --> 09:06.419
and I would go,
"Roadie, sic 'em!"

09:06.420 --> 09:07.887
She'd run in the hallway...
come back in.

09:07.888 --> 09:09.053
People are, like,
"Oh, that's really cute."

09:09.054 --> 09:11.550
I took the shark outfit,
I put it on Roadie.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.892
Tiny little shark outfit.

09:12.893 --> 09:15.184
The great thing about this was,
when the shark outfit

09:15.185 --> 09:17.931
was on the dog,
you couldn't see the dog.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.061
All you could see
was this misshapen shark

09:22.062 --> 09:23.439
kind of reptilian-looking thing.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.564
It was an odd color,
a weird shape,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.149
it had a fin right here,

09:27.150 --> 09:29.359
two fins out the back,
a thing in the tail,

09:29.360 --> 09:32.821
and teeth and eyes...
it was fantastic!

09:32.822 --> 09:33.992
Now, when you're frightened,

09:33.993 --> 09:35.990
your emotions of being
frightened take over,

09:35.991 --> 09:38.245
but then your cognitive brain
recognizes really quickly

09:38.246 --> 09:39.912
what it is
that's frightening you

09:39.913 --> 09:42.007
and you calm down immediately.
It's like, "Aah! Oh.

09:42.008 --> 09:43.665
Ha-ha, that's really funny."

09:43.666 --> 09:46.168
When something comes
around the corner at you

09:46.169 --> 09:48.295
that your brain
can't recognize...

09:49.839 --> 09:53.884
...especially when it looks
likes some sort of odd reptilian

09:53.885 --> 09:55.844
prehistoric thing,

09:55.845 --> 09:58.639
your lizard
primordial brain kicks in.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.350
And I mean 300-pound,
tough working guys

10:01.351 --> 10:02.692
that come walking
around the corner.

10:02.693 --> 10:04.606
She'd come running
around the corner like this,

10:04.607 --> 10:06.527
not making any noise,
and they'd be, like,

10:06.528 --> 10:08.357
"Wh-What the ... is that!"

10:15.782 --> 10:18.534
I had pee stains on the carpet
outside my dressing room.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.202
<i>It was...</i>

10:20.203 --> 10:22.581
All right. You like the
dog stories, I got one more.

10:22.582 --> 10:24.289
I adopted a dog
a few months ago,

10:24.290 --> 10:26.208
and this was a surrender dog...

10:26.209 --> 10:27.793
some family
just giving up on him

10:27.794 --> 10:29.336
and giving him to the shelter.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.554
We didn't know why it was.

10:30.555 --> 10:31.880
We named him Buddy.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.383
And, uh,
he's a Jack Russell terrier.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.388
It took us about a half a day
to figure out

10:39.389 --> 10:42.224
why some other family
gave up on Buddy.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.226
Buddy's an idiot.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.727
He's like, bark, bark, bark,
bark, run, run, run, run,

10:45.728 --> 10:46.854
bark, bark, bark, bark.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.277
This dog would not stop barking.

10:48.278 --> 10:49.523
He's nuts.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.069
He's a sweet dog,
but he's freaking nuts.

10:51.070 --> 10:53.569
So we went to the dog trainer,
we said, "What do we do?"

10:53.570 --> 10:54.740
The dog trainer said, "I have

10:54.741 --> 10:56.408
“two ways of taking care
of a barking dog.

10:56.409 --> 10:57.656
You have to teach...
work with the dog."

10:57.657 --> 10:58.952
I'm like, "Fantastic.
What do you do?“

10:58.953 --> 11:00.916
She goes, “Well, one
is a spray bottle with water."

11:00.917 --> 11:02.125
I go, "I know. We've done that."

11:02.126 --> 11:03.586
She goes,
“No, no, not just water."

11:03.587 --> 11:05.546
She goes, “You don't want
to do just water

11:05.547 --> 11:06.755
"to a Jack Russell terrier,

11:06.756 --> 11:08.249
"because they eventually
like the water

11:08.250 --> 11:10.549
and think it's just a new way
of getting a drink."

11:10.550 --> 11:12.337
She said, "You got to mix

11:12.338 --> 11:15.257
about 40% of Listerine
with the water."

11:15.258 --> 11:16.599
I'm like, "Oh, that's awful."

11:16.600 --> 11:18.389
She goes, "No, no,
it doesn't really hurt them.

11:18.390 --> 11:20.432
"It just gets their attention,
bothers them, then they realize

11:20.433 --> 11:22.305
"when they're barking,
you spray them and say no,

11:22.306 --> 11:23.648
they eventually learn
not to bark.“

11:23.649 --> 11:25.564
I'm like, “Okay, Listerine
in the water. Got it."

11:25.565 --> 11:28.395
She said, “The other way,
I have this electronic collar.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.273
And it's not a mean thing...
it's not a shocking collar."

11:31.274 --> 11:33.618
She goes, “It's a new thing.
It's an electronic thing.

11:33.619 --> 11:35.944
“When the dog barks,
it puffs out

11:35.945 --> 11:38.614
“this puff of citronella
right in their face.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.449
So, eventually, they learn..."

11:43.786 --> 11:44.956
“...they learn not to bark."

11:44.957 --> 11:46.295
I'm like,
“Okay, send us the collar.

11:46.296 --> 11:47.415
Fantastic. We'll try that."
"Okay, great."

11:47.416 --> 11:48.916
So we put the collar on Buddy,

11:48.917 --> 11:50.792
I got the spray bottle ready,
everything was great.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.384
Buddy would bark.
Spray him in the face.

11:52.385 --> 11:53.468
Like...
Okay, fine.

11:53.469 --> 11:54.885
I'm not going to do that.

11:54.886 --> 11:57.174
Like that... he learned,
okay, don't like that.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.886
One day, Buddy was having
a really bad day.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.429
It was raining outside.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.771
He wouldn't stop barking.

12:03.772 --> 12:06.016
Anything that moved in
the backyard, he would bark at.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.733
I'm spraying with the bottle.
I'm trying to get stuff done.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.147
He's barking, he's bugging
the heck out of me,

12:09.148 --> 12:10.315
and I'm spraying,
I'm spraying him.

12:10.316 --> 12:11.781
He's barking, he's barking.

12:11.782 --> 12:14.149
By the end of the day,
this poor dog

12:14.150 --> 12:17.736
smelled like he was from
the dentist's office.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.530
His hair was completely matted.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.116
His eyes were bloodshot.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.577
He looked
like Nick Nolte's mug shot.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.496
That's what he looked like.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.631
And then the really sad part
was he barked so much that day,

12:37.632 --> 12:40.676
the battery on the collar
had worn down,

12:40.677 --> 12:43.512
and now the timing
was completely off.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.806
But by the end of the day,
he had learned.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.682
He's a smart dog,
and I swear to God,

12:47.683 --> 12:50.153
by the end of the day,
this is what he was doing.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.369
And then, when the sun came out,

13:07.370 --> 13:09.791
he was eventually running
around the backyard again.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.414
He didn't care about
the collar any more.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.713
He didn't care
about the Listerine.

13:12.714 --> 13:15.002
And we could not catch this dog.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.844
He'd be running around
chasing squirrels.

13:16.845 --> 13:18.840
And we have an eight-foot fence
that's about five inches wide,

13:18.841 --> 13:20.340
goes all the way
around the yard,

13:20.341 --> 13:22.262
and the squirrels just run
around the top of the fence

13:22.263 --> 13:24.386
and bug the heck out of the dog,
and you can't catch him.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.103
Run, run, run, run,
bark, bark, bark, bark.

13:26.104 --> 13:27.895
But my fiancée...
her name is Audrey...

13:27.896 --> 13:30.559
she came up with something
that was a brilliant idea.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.060
She would go out in the backyard

13:32.061 --> 13:33.686
when Buddy was barking
and chasing the squirrel,

13:33.687 --> 13:35.406
and she'd stand
right next to the fence

13:35.407 --> 13:38.025
and look up like she's trying
to find the squirrel, too.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.697
Buddy's smart.
He would run up to her

13:39.698 --> 13:41.365
and go, "Oh,
you're trying to help me.

13:41.366 --> 13:42.407
Where's the squirrel?"

13:42.408 --> 13:43.622
She'd reach down and go,

13:43.623 --> 13:45.699
“You idiot. I got you.
You're done. All right."

13:47.201 --> 13:48.874
All right.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.042
Now, I'm watching this
thinking the dog's smart.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.419
He's going to learn after
about four or five times that,

13:57.420 --> 13:58.840
"No, this is stupid.
I can't run next to her.

13:58.841 --> 14:00.133
She's just trying to catch me."

14:00.134 --> 14:01.802
I thought, "I'll get in
on the act a little more.

14:01.803 --> 14:03.674
I did the same thing,
but when I picked him up,

14:03.675 --> 14:05.223
I thought, “I'm going to be
part of the team."

14:05.224 --> 14:08.472
I would actually pick him up
and hold him up.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.348
And I can pick him up
just high enough

14:10.349 --> 14:11.770
that he could take
his little paws

14:11.771 --> 14:13.018
on the edge of the fence,

14:13.019 --> 14:14.612
and he'd pull himself up
like this...

14:14.613 --> 14:16.438
honest to God...
and he could look

14:16.439 --> 14:19.775
up and down the fence like this,
looking for the squirrel.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.072
And then he'd look over
and look in the other yard.

14:22.073 --> 14:23.285
Okay, no squirrel.

14:23.286 --> 14:24.995
And then I'd slowly
lower him back down.

14:24.996 --> 14:27.035
And then we'd walk down
to the edge of the fence.

14:27.036 --> 14:28.624
Like, we're still
a few feet down.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.289
I'd pick him up,
he'd do it again.

14:30.290 --> 14:31.501
Look, look, look.

14:31.502 --> 14:33.371
Eventually, he thought
I was part of the team.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.670
Fantastic. It worked.

14:34.671 --> 14:36.833
Three days later,
I'm sitting on the couch.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.419
I look over at Audrey, and I go,
"You know, that thing,

14:39.420 --> 14:41.341
picking him up like that,
that's working pretty well."

14:41.342 --> 14:42.634
She goes,
"Yeah, it's working great."

14:42.635 --> 14:44.634
I go, “Wonder
what that looks like

14:44.635 --> 14:46.802
from the other side
of the fence."

14:53.643 --> 14:55.811
Sure enough, honest to God,

14:55.812 --> 14:58.146
couple days later,
get a phone call.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.900
"Hi, uh... Jeff, this is Bob
from next door.“

15:01.901 --> 15:04.152
"Hey, Bob. What's going on?"

15:04.153 --> 15:08.490
“Um, I... I don't know
how to say this, but, <i>um...</i>

15:08.491 --> 15:10.867
"my wife says that your dog

15:10.868 --> 15:12.994
is spying on her
in the backyard."

15:19.669 --> 15:22.212
I'm like, "What are you
talking about, Bob?"

15:22.213 --> 15:24.464
He goes, “Well,
I-I didn't believe her,

15:24.465 --> 15:27.342
"but yesterday, I'm out in
the backyard watering the lawn,

15:27.343 --> 15:29.928
“and sure enough,
son of a ...

15:29.929 --> 15:32.681
your dog is peering
over the fence."

15:36.853 --> 15:38.395
“I don't know how he does it,

15:38.396 --> 15:40.319
but then he lowered himself
back down."

15:42.150 --> 15:43.525
I go, "Yeah, Bob."

15:43.526 --> 15:44.650
He goes, "No, really.

15:44.651 --> 15:46.029
"And then,
about 30 seconds later,

15:46.030 --> 15:48.907
he's ten feet down the fence
looking at me again."

15:50.992 --> 15:53.618
“And then he lowered himself
back down."

15:53.619 --> 15:55.537
I'm like, "Okay, Bob.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.757
I'll have a talk with Buddy."

15:58.916 --> 16:00.543
And he goes,
"No, no, it's worse."

16:00.544 --> 16:02.377
I go, "What's worse, Bob?"

16:02.378 --> 16:04.631
He goes, "Well, I think
your dog's trying to kill us,

16:04.632 --> 16:06.965
but he's not good at it yet."

16:06.966 --> 16:08.718
I said, “Bob, what are you
talking about?"

16:08.719 --> 16:11.887
He goes, "Well, a few hours
later, he's looking at me again,

16:11.888 --> 16:14.097
"but then he barked,
turned his head sideways,

16:14.098 --> 16:16.391
winced, and an explosion
went off."

16:26.986 --> 16:30.071
Are you guys ready for
the little people in the boxes?

16:32.283 --> 16:33.910
All right.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.411
Here's how this works.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.914
I told all the guys they could
be whoever they want tonight.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.166
It's a monster special,
so just pick.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.376
So, here we go.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.115
It's alive! It's alive!

17:12.240 --> 17:13.949
And it's trying to sleep.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.825
Shut the hell up.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.287
And now I'm going to
build you a bride.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.714
<i>You will be terrified.</i>

17:47.066 --> 17:50.491
Ah, shut the hell up.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.615
This is not my idea.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.992
Good evening, Walter.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.202
Do I look like Walter?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.288
You look like a
Walter Frankenstein.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.883
Well, then,
call me Crankenstein.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.668
All right, Crankenstein.

18:06.669 --> 18:07.836
You look good.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.504
No, I don't.
I look like a cross

18:09.505 --> 18:11.178
between Hillary Clinton
and the Hulk.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.641
No offense, Hulk.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.859
You don't look like
either one of them.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.356
Ah, then I look like Gumby
in a nursing home.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.358
How about that?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.235
That would make you Pokey.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.155
Get it? You're an ass.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.658
I got it.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.494
That's pretty good.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.872
Yeah, I've been
working on that.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.207
- That's my angry sound.
- Yeah.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.917
Here's my happy sound.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.380
Here's "surprised."

18:54.675 --> 18:56.051
Here's gay...

18:59.597 --> 19:00.892
If you don't like the costume,

19:00.893 --> 19:02.267
then why'd you pick this one?

19:02.268 --> 19:05.101
We were supposed to dress
as whatever scared us <i>as</i> a kid.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.437
Oh. So, for you,
that was Frankenstein?

19:07.438 --> 19:10.273
Actually, it was
a Catholic priest, but...

19:16.739 --> 19:18.114
But...

19:18.115 --> 19:21.368
everybody gets mad
when I offend the Mexicans.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.042
Walter, are you ever happy?

19:29.043 --> 19:30.460
You should hope not.

19:30.461 --> 19:31.628
Why?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.004
Can you imagine me

19:33.005 --> 19:34.473
coming out here
in a good mood?

19:34.474 --> 19:35.757
Hi, everybody.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.102
I'm Walter,
and life is peachy!

19:39.428 --> 19:41.476
You'd be working at Starbucks
in a ... week.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.605
What?

19:50.606 --> 19:52.107
Language.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.942
English.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.957
And you didn't even
have to push "one" to hear it.

20:09.959 --> 20:13.128
You know, Walter, these people
came here to be entertained.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.046
Not all of 'em.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.015
You know there's a handful
of guys sitting out there

20:17.016 --> 20:18.883
right now
whose wives were, like,

20:18.884 --> 20:20.760
“Oh, come on,
we have to go see

20:20.761 --> 20:22.809
the middle-aged dumb ass
and his dolls.“

20:25.433 --> 20:28.309
And now those guys are sitting
out there right now, going,

20:28.310 --> 20:30.478
"Son of a...

20:30.479 --> 20:33.982
It's a middle-aged dumb ass
and his dolls."

20:35.317 --> 20:37.485
And now you're playing
dress-up with your dolls.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.081
When's the tea party, Ken?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.416
Ah.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.546
Middle-aged dumb ass.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.174
Which part of that
do you not like the most?

21:00.718 --> 21:03.803
Middle-aged or dumb ass?

21:03.804 --> 21:05.722
- What do you think?
- Well,

21:05.723 --> 21:09.392
you're only as old as you feel,
but dumb ass is in the DNA.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.817
Walter! Walter!

21:17.818 --> 21:19.694
You know, speaking
of, uh, age,

21:19.695 --> 21:21.536
you're not exactly
young any more.

21:21.537 --> 21:22.531
<i>Hey...!</i>

21:23.657 --> 21:24.872
Let's think about this
for a second.

21:24.873 --> 21:26.869
What, how long have I been
in the show?

21:26.870 --> 21:28.870
- 24 years.
- 24 years.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.372
So anybody who might have seen
our show 24 years ago...

21:31.373 --> 21:32.916
Yeah?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.251
I look exactly the same.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.047
<i>You do not.</i>

21:40.466 --> 21:42.675
Yeah, this show started out
young man-old man.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.019
Pretty soon,
we're gonna be

21:44.020 --> 21:46.471
the stinkin' Sunshine Boys.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.642
I used to give you
dating and marriage advice.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.060
Not too long from now,

21:52.061 --> 21:54.562
we're gonna be on stage
comparing colonoscopies.

21:55.773 --> 21:58.900
You know, Walter, age
is a state of mind.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.485
Not when your ass
starts leaking.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.569
<i>Uh...</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:13.164
Yeah, there's a couple
of old farts in the front row,

22:13.165 --> 22:14.335
going, "Yeah, he's right, Lars.

22:14.336 --> 22:15.755
My ass is leaking.
He's right."

22:15.756 --> 22:19.087
And then, after that,
you're gonna die.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.761
I'll be on
the shelf somewhere.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.262
Well, no more nightly
prostate exams.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.235
You know, Walter, technically,
you're not really Frankenstein.

22:33.236 --> 22:35.270
- What? -Well, most people
don't realize this,

22:35.271 --> 22:36.938
but the monster
was The Monster,

22:36.939 --> 22:39.107
and Frankenstein was
actually the doctor.

22:39.108 --> 22:43.695
Well, thank you, Professor
Googles-Too...-Much.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.702
You know, you should...
you should Tweet that.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.369
How about that?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.371
Then you can Tweet,
"I'm a huge dork.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.290
Frowny face,
hashtag, Dumb Ass."

22:59.753 --> 23:01.880
- Walter...
- I'll take "Things

23:01.881 --> 23:04.340
That Will Never Get You Laid"
for $500, Alex.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.970
Well, I will say,
I like your costume.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.430
Well, great.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.646
- Franken-stein.
- Right.

23:11.647 --> 23:12.983
Sounds like a Jewish name.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.478
You think Dr. Frankenstein
was Jewish?

23:17.479 --> 23:19.447
- I don't know.
- That would explain a lot.

23:19.448 --> 23:20.690
Why is that?

23:20.691 --> 23:22.659
He was digging up
used body parts.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.027
Right.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.820
Probably to save money.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.578
Oh, tell me I'm wrong!

23:35.080 --> 23:36.998
Yeah, that's it.
He was Jewish.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.500
And that explains why his
monster was angry all the time.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.711
Why?

23:41.712 --> 23:44.213
Because he's circumcised,
the poor bastard.

23:45.507 --> 23:49.010
Now that changes
the movie completely.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.264
He's killing the villagers
because he's deranged.

23:51.265 --> 23:53.348
No, he's not.
His wiener hurts.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.354
And it was somebody else's.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.067
You know, if I were
really that monster,

24:04.068 --> 24:07.278
wherever the doctor
was digging up parts, yeah,

24:07.279 --> 24:10.740
I'd hope that cemetery had one
dead black guy and no Asians.

24:14.203 --> 24:17.330
That's right.
I did a racist wiener joke.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.959
Happy frickin' Hallow-wiener.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.225
Walter, you went from
Frankenstein

24:32.226 --> 24:34.889
to circumstision... sision.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.061
Focus!

24:41.647 --> 24:46.442
What the hell
is circumstision?

24:46.443 --> 24:49.487
Sounds like something they cut
out of the Constitution.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.198
Just the top part.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.449
All right.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.078
Yeah, by the fore-fathers.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.287
All right.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.262
And that's another thing.

25:07.263 --> 25:09.224
Why was the doctor's monster
seven feet tall?

25:09.225 --> 25:10.591
What?

25:10.592 --> 25:11.762
That's dangerous.

25:11.763 --> 25:13.760
He should have started
with a small monster.

25:13.761 --> 25:15.514
- Small monster?
- Yeah. Frankenmidget.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.312
If anything goes nuts,
just strap his ass

25:19.313 --> 25:21.778
to the kid's car seat and drive
around till he falls asleep.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.981
Parents do it
all the time.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.483
You think it's loose, what's
the worst that could happen?

25:27.484 --> 25:29.234
You get a call
from the villagers.

25:29.235 --> 25:30.611
"Hey, come get your monster.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.455
He's in our yard,
and he's humping our cat."

25:33.657 --> 25:35.241
"That's impossible.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.909
His wiener hurts."

25:40.622 --> 25:42.295
You know, Walter,
you're no longer supposed

25:42.296 --> 25:44.500
to use the word "midget."
They don't like it.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.754
I think what they really don't
like is being three feet tall.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.548
But I'll make sure.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.844
If there are any midgets here

25:51.845 --> 25:53.435
that have a problem,
raise your hand.

25:53.436 --> 25:56.054
Higher, higher...

26:02.603 --> 26:04.562
Huh!

26:07.524 --> 26:09.442
What's wrong
with you tonight?

26:09.443 --> 26:10.695
Uh, take a guess.

26:10.696 --> 26:12.528
I don't know.
Is your wife okay?

26:12.529 --> 26:13.863
That's exactly right.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.450
Wait a minute... your wife
is happy and healthy,

26:17.451 --> 26:19.118
and she's always
in a good mood.

26:19.119 --> 26:22.038
I know, and it's the worst
in the mornings. Good God.

26:22.039 --> 26:26.084
It's, like, "Oh, good morning,
Sunshine."

26:27.294 --> 26:29.087
Holy crap.

26:29.088 --> 26:33.049
Makes me want to drop-kick
her frickin' poodle.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.845
Morning, honey!

26:37.846 --> 26:41.015
It's a kick-ass day now!

26:42.935 --> 26:44.858
I should shove a stick
in that dog's ass

26:44.859 --> 26:47.021
- and use it to clean
the toilets. -Oh.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.408
Course, if you're
in Australia, it'd <i>be...</i>

27:01.912 --> 27:03.539
Walter, I thought your
marriage was solid.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.540
It is, in a constipated
kind of way.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.417
But you still
love each other.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.295
Yes. The love changes
when you get older.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.546
How's that?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.881
Well, you go from wanting
to make out in a car

27:13.882 --> 27:17.009
to wanting to run over
each other with a car.

27:17.010 --> 27:20.012
You go from "I was struck
by Cupid's arrow, “ to,

27:20.013 --> 27:22.390
"Maybe she'll get hit
by a frickin' Camaro."

27:23.559 --> 27:25.560
From, "Hold me and love, me,

27:25.561 --> 27:27.313
to "Kiss my ass
and die,..."

27:28.480 --> 27:30.439
Oh, that's awful.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.862
Now what about
life after death?

27:31.863 --> 27:33.025
Huh?

27:33.026 --> 27:34.697
Some people think
that even after death,

27:34.698 --> 27:36.368
you're still together
for all of eternity.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.910
I'm pretty sure you just
told me to go to Hell.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.839
- Back to the monster stuff.
- Sure.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.175
Is there any particular
movie that scares you?

27:57.176 --> 27:58.843
Yeah, the film
of my wedding.

28:00.179 --> 28:04.265
But if I'm depressed,
I watch it backwards.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.602
You get it?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.228
She walks away.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.276
- Come on, you love your wife.
- Yeah, I know.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.987
But on our wedding, when
she came walking down the aisle,

28:17.988 --> 28:20.239
with that giant hair
and all that makeup,

28:20.240 --> 28:23.784
I felt like yelling,
"it's alive! It's alive!"

28:23.785 --> 28:25.703
So, how did
the service go?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.872
Well, the worst part was
when the minister asked

28:27.873 --> 28:30.583
if anyone objected,
and no one would listen to me.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.509
Maybe they
couldn't hear you.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.088
Hey, you're right.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.423
You weren't there.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.478
So what happened
after the wedding?

28:47.479 --> 28:49.103
- She started eating cake.
- Right.

28:49.104 --> 28:51.020
Non-stop.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.563
- For 45 years.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.899
- You know what scares me now?
- What?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.317
When my wife says,

28:56.318 --> 28:58.819
"Does this thong
make my ass look fat?"

29:00.072 --> 29:01.948
You didn't answer
that, right?

29:01.949 --> 29:04.116
I guessed
I shouldn't have.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.289
What did you say?

29:05.290 --> 29:07.203
I asked her
if it was a thong,

29:07.204 --> 29:10.081
or if her ass grew
over her panties.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.386
That's terrible.

29:17.387 --> 29:19.258
Yeah, I probably
should have stopped there.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.677
What else did you say?

29:22.678 --> 29:25.304
I said, “No, the thong
doesn't make your ass look fat.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.932
Your fat ass makes
your fat ass look fat."

29:29.893 --> 29:31.852
The thong is the victim.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.901
Why-why are you
telling me this?

29:38.902 --> 29:40.370
It's a horror show, right?

29:40.371 --> 29:41.612
Yeah.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.490
Let's talk
about Halloween.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.038
All right, well,
that's less scary.

29:46.039 --> 29:47.285
Yeah.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.084
You guys still get a
lot of trick-or-treaters?

29:49.085 --> 29:50.246
Not any more.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.539
Why?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.211
Well, a couple
of years ago, unfortunately,

29:53.212 --> 29:54.378
my wife answered the door

29:54.379 --> 29:56.799
with one of her knockers
hanging out of her robe.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.798
Yeah, we still get
therapy bills from those kids.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.927
Did you actually
say "knockers"?

30:04.928 --> 30:07.638
Yeah, I guess now they're
more like ﬂappers.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.684
Hell, if she moves
just right,

30:11.685 --> 30:13.978
they flop like
two doggy doors.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.815
Oh, yeah, last week
she did jumping jacks

30:17.816 --> 30:19.734
and ended up
with two black eyes.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.488
Then there are the teenagers
who show up at your door

30:24.489 --> 30:25.864
with a sack and no costume.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.618
- Right.
- They just had the munchies

30:27.619 --> 30:30.411
from smoking
too much weed.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.705
- Weed.
- Yeah, you know, pot.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.165
- I know.
- Maryjane.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.000
- Right.
- Ganja.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.253
The chronic.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.464
The Bangkok blastoff.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.466
The sticky icky.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.427
How do you know all this?

30:46.428 --> 30:49.096
<i>I... have glaucoma.</i>

30:57.814 --> 31:00.274
You know what
scares me now?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.528
- What? -Medical Web sites where
you enter your symptoms

31:02.529 --> 31:04.362
and it tells you
what you have.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.113
- Are you sick?
- I think so.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.331
What do you have?

31:07.332 --> 31:09.116
I pretty much
narrowed it down

31:09.117 --> 31:10.618
to a uterus infection.

31:13.747 --> 31:16.165
Or mesothelioma.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.833
Mesothelioma?

31:17.834 --> 31:19.300
You get that
from asbestos.

31:19.301 --> 31:21.012
That's what Peanut
is made out of.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.344
What, are you
sniffing Peanut?

31:28.345 --> 31:31.472
It's lonely
on the road, Jeff.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.357
Speaking of lonely,

31:41.358 --> 31:43.818
earlier, did I hear you
say you're engaged now?

31:43.819 --> 31:45.361
You have a fiancée?

31:45.362 --> 31:46.612
That's right.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.536
What the...
is wrong with you?

31:55.622 --> 31:57.665
You don't get a call

31:57.666 --> 31:59.337
from the governor
and then turn around

31:59.338 --> 32:01.177
and strap yourself
back in the chair.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.723
You've met Audrey.

32:14.724 --> 32:15.891
Yeah.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.645
- It's a nice chair.
: Yeah.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.364
Yeah, you won't
have to have that one

32:21.365 --> 32:22.898
reupholstered for a while.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.027
- Say good night, Walter.
- Thanks, Savannah!

32:27.028 --> 32:29.531
- That's Walter.

32:35.328 --> 32:38.706
<i>Feel the cold grip
of his presence.</i>

32:38.707 --> 32:40.875
<i>He sleeps in the tomb by day...</i>

32:42.174 --> 32:43.711
<i>...and arises at night</i>

32:43.712 --> 32:46.213
<i>with an insatiable thirst.</i>

32:55.223 --> 32:57.266
I fear we're
dealing with...

32:57.267 --> 32:59.185
a vampire.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.569
Back! Back!

33:09.070 --> 33:10.279
Oh, no!

33:10.280 --> 33:12.364
Okay, maybe,
but I'm not gonna ﬂoss.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.604
Eh...

33:43.605 --> 33:44.606
How you doing, Bubba J?

33:44.607 --> 33:46.732
I'm doing purty good!

33:47.951 --> 33:50.027
So, are you
ready for this?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.530
Oh, yeah, been looking
forward to it, yeah, yeah.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.407
- You look good. -Oh, yeah,
I look good. Thanks a lot.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.660
- You have hair.
- I know!

33:59.454 --> 34:01.247
It's a miracle!

34:01.248 --> 34:04.291
It's like an armpit
grew on my head.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.960
Well, I bet you didn't even

34:05.961 --> 34:07.962
recognize yourself
in a mirror.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.214
Oh, I never look
in a mirror.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.507
Why not?

34:11.507 --> 34:13.759
Because in a mirror
I'm backwards,

34:13.760 --> 34:15.886
and it scares me.

34:18.306 --> 34:21.058
- It scares you?
- Yeah, because I know

34:21.059 --> 34:23.226
that all mirrors
are actually windows

34:23.228 --> 34:25.688
to that world where
everything they do

34:25.688 --> 34:28.357
is the opposite of us.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.989
And when they look
in the mirror, they see us,

34:35.991 --> 34:40.369
and we're doing everything
they do but backwards to them.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.371
That's ridiculous.

34:43.373 --> 34:46.500
I know, but you
can't prove me wrong!

34:53.425 --> 34:56.969
- Bubba J... -And sometimes folks
from that world

34:56.969 --> 34:59.763
lose their way and
then somehow end up

34:59.764 --> 35:01.515
in this world.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.143
They are amongst us.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.233
How can you tell?

35:11.234 --> 35:13.485
- They're easy to spot.
- How?

35:13.486 --> 35:16.655
Because they write
with their left hands.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.998
All right... Well, you
want to talk about

35:25.999 --> 35:27.091
why we're here tonight?

35:27.092 --> 35:28.417
Yeah, let's do it!

35:28.418 --> 35:29.884
- Okay.
- Are the cameras on?

35:29.885 --> 35:31.549
- They are.
- Is the tape rolling?

35:31.550 --> 35:32.718
- Yes.
- Great.

35:32.719 --> 35:34.715
Quiet on the set.
Take one.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.718
- You have the first line.
- Okay.

35:37.719 --> 35:39.136
Don't ... it up...

35:41.723 --> 35:44.391
All right, so, uh, Bubba J,
you're a vampire.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.394
Yep, and I've come to suck
your beer.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.563
- Yeah!

35:54.611 --> 35:56.862
- Well, you look good.
- I'm Count Beer-cula.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.074
And I drink Blood-weiser.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.660
Yeah, yeah.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.036
Anything else?

36:04.037 --> 36:06.246
Yeah, I'm a white trash vampire.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.581
How's that?

36:07.582 --> 36:09.416
My coffin has a gun rack.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.169
Really?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.754
And I bit my cousin.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.093
Wait a minute, your...

36:19.094 --> 36:20.516
your coffin has a gun rack?

36:20.517 --> 36:22.221
Everything I own
has a gun rack.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.306
My gun rack has a gun rack.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.601
My coffeemaker
has a gun rack.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.062
My dishwasher
has a gun rack.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.532
- Your dishwasher? -Actually,
I don't have a dishwasher.

36:32.533 --> 36:33.774
<i>Oh.</i>

36:33.775 --> 36:37.444
My wife is my dishwasher,
but she has a rack!

36:43.118 --> 36:46.286
Yeah. I could rest
my pistol there,

36:46.287 --> 36:48.455
if you know what
I'm talking about, <i>eh...</i>

36:49.874 --> 36:51.419
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

36:51.420 --> 36:52.886
'Cause I don't.
I don't know.

36:52.887 --> 36:55.796
So, Bubba J, why'd you
choose to be a vampire?

36:55.797 --> 36:58.132
- Well, we have a lot in common.
- How's that?

36:58.133 --> 37:00.634
We both hang around
with folks with red necks.

37:02.846 --> 37:06.390
- Makes sense. -Yeah, and if
you're a redneck vampire,

37:06.391 --> 37:09.143
you can only be killed
by a silver mullet.

37:13.606 --> 37:17.067
Or a chicken-fried stake
through the heart.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.485
Ha...

37:18.486 --> 37:20.487
Why only one big tooth?

37:20.488 --> 37:21.989
It's a bottle opener.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.162
<i>Oh, I see, yeah.</i>

37:24.659 --> 37:27.327
- Well, I think this was a good
choice for you. -Yeah.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.672
I wanted to be a ghost, but
somebody backstage told me

37:29.673 --> 37:33.083
a redneck in a white sheet
wasn't a good idea.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.762
Bubba J, I was
wondering something.

37:44.763 --> 37:48.557
Yeah, that happens
to me a lot, too.

37:48.558 --> 37:51.226
What I was gonna say is,
what happens if a vampire

37:51.227 --> 37:53.270
drinks the blood
of an alcoholic?

37:54.272 --> 37:57.191
That's genius!

37:58.234 --> 38:01.820
I got a blood-alcohol
level of 3.4.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.989
I should bite myself.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.116
- Wait,

38:06.117 --> 38:08.202
if I do that,
will I go blind?

38:14.667 --> 38:15.918
No.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.136
Oh, yeah, that's
something else, isn't it?

38:17.137 --> 38:19.254
- Yeah.
- Okay, no, no, no.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.298
But that's a pretty high
blood-alcohol level.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.467
Yeah, drink too much
of my blood,

38:23.468 --> 38:25.177
and you'll end up
going home

38:25.178 --> 38:27.146
with a ugly chick
with a lazy eye.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.391
And you won't even
realize she's a he.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.898
So, Bubba J, are
you Team Edward

38:37.899 --> 38:39.107
or Team Jacob?

38:39.108 --> 38:40.234
Oh-ho.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.944
I'm Team Jack Daniels.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.866
Yeah. I've-I've seen
those Twilight vampires.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.660
I'm not sure about that.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.329
- That one main guy,
he's got a six-pack. -Right.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.422
Yeah, big deal.

38:53.423 --> 38:54.957
I got a keg.

39:01.756 --> 39:05.050
I'm not sure about the old
kind of vampires, either.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.636
- How's that? -Well, I could
never sleep in this coffin.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.721
Why not?

39:09.722 --> 39:12.057
Well, my favorite things
are beer and bean dip.

39:13.726 --> 39:15.394
Yeah, you get it, huh?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.653
Not good when you're
in a pine box

39:18.654 --> 39:20.566
with no holes in it.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.401
Dutch oven, my ass.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.945
Oh, yeah?

39:24.946 --> 39:26.613
So, Bubba J, did you go

39:26.614 --> 39:27.911
trick-or-treating when
you were a kid?

39:27.912 --> 39:30.200
Yeah, but where I lived,
it wasn't easy.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.078
- Why? -It's hard to go
trick-or-treat

39:32.079 --> 39:35.163
where any house you're at
could suddenly pull away.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.958
Ding-dong!

39:37.959 --> 39:39.129
Trick or treat!

39:49.345 --> 39:51.972
He's got Milky Ways!
Shoot the tires!

39:52.974 --> 39:54.474
Well, Bubba J, you look good.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.978
Well, I was gonna come
dressed as a monster truck.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.771
A monster truck?
Why didn't you?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.815
The mufﬂer kept
falling out of my ass.

40:03.318 --> 40:06.570
- Well, like this, I think
you're pretty scary. -Thanks.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.530
- But what scares you?
- Oh.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.657
Tornadoes...

40:10.658 --> 40:13.827
Breathalyzers...

40:13.828 --> 40:15.454
and books with words.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.755
Well, I agree with
you on the tornadoes.

40:19.756 --> 40:22.127
Yeah, it's pretty scary
when you get into bed,

40:22.128 --> 40:25.339
and the room is spinning
the wrong way.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.843
Think about it.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.847
I don't think Dorothy's house
really went anywhere.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.724
She was just drunk
off her ass.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.858
You know, Bubba J,

40:44.859 --> 40:48.236
you kind of look like The
Count on Sesame Street.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.864
Oh. That's the vampire
that knows how to count, right?

40:50.865 --> 40:52.074
Yeah.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.043
That's where he
and I are different.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.037
So, how high
can you count?

40:57.038 --> 40:58.872
Six.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.541
When I buy a 12-pack,
I just have to trust 'em.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.213
Well, you can just
buy two six-packs.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.595
I think I hurt my brain.

41:13.596 --> 41:16.181
Bubba J, if you
were a real vampire,

41:16.182 --> 41:18.148
you'd have to stay
inside all day.

41:18.149 --> 41:19.564
- Yeah.
- What would you do?

41:19.565 --> 41:22.562
I'd watch NASCAR
on my plasma TV.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.147
Oh. You...

41:24.148 --> 41:26.566
Wait a minute. You have...
you have a plasma TV?

41:26.567 --> 41:27.734
Well, sort of.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.194
It's a regular TV,

41:29.195 --> 41:32.447
but I call it that, 'cause
I sold my blood to get it.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.748
How big is the TV?

41:41.749 --> 41:42.916
63 inches.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.251
That's a good one.

41:44.252 --> 41:47.254
Yeah. The first thing
I watched on it was a sad movie

41:47.255 --> 41:49.881
about a dead-end street
where drunk guys struggle

41:49.882 --> 41:53.218
to find some meaning
in their pathetic lives.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.470
It was a half an hour
before I realized

41:55.471 --> 41:57.639
I was gazing out
my front window.

42:01.936 --> 42:04.271
I love Halloween:
"Trick or drink!"

42:05.773 --> 42:07.023
Trick or treat.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.277
Not on my road.

42:09.986 --> 42:12.195
What do you do, hand
out cans of beer?

42:12.196 --> 42:15.282
That'd be dumb. No, no.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.868
I squirt 'em in the mouth
with a keg hose.

42:19.203 --> 42:22.789
Yeah, that ain't no normal
golden shower.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.253
I wouldn't know.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.172
Ha. Yeah, whatever.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.842
Do you ever have any trouble

42:33.843 --> 42:35.265
around your neighborhood
on Halloween?

42:35.266 --> 42:38.305
Yeah. Last Halloween,
somebody threw toilet tissue

42:38.306 --> 42:39.806
all over my trailer.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.141
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:41.142 --> 42:42.314
Just in time, too.

42:42.315 --> 42:45.187
I was out of leaves,
and down to pinecones.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.992
So, Bubba J, what
else scares you?

42:49.993 --> 42:51.735
Being kidnapped by aliens.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.028
Right.

42:53.029 --> 42:55.655
The ones from space,
not Mexico.

42:57.450 --> 42:59.291
Hey, do you know
what the difference is

42:59.292 --> 43:00.457
between space aliens

43:00.458 --> 43:01.912
and illegal aliens?

43:01.913 --> 43:03.288
No. What?

43:03.289 --> 43:06.458
Occasionally, space aliens
go back to where they came from.

43:14.801 --> 43:18.261
So, Bubba J, what do you
like most about Halloween?

43:18.262 --> 43:21.681
Oh, I like it when hot girls
dress up like sexy kittens.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.517
- Kittens?
- Yeah.

43:23.518 --> 43:27.270
Which, after too much beer, led
to my unfortunate incident

43:27.271 --> 43:28.688
with my neighbor's cat.

43:30.191 --> 43:33.360
Yeah. I still have scratches
in bad places.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.614
And one really good one.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.991
So does the cat.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.993
My Cousin Jed likes cats, too.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.962
- I see.
- Jed isn't his real name.

43:43.963 --> 43:46.832
That's just what we call him
since he got his GED.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.380
Doesn't that spell "Ged"?

43:53.381 --> 43:56.049
I don't ka-know.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.386
Where'd you grow
up, Bubba J?

43:59.387 --> 44:00.559
All over the place.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.557
I was mobile home-schooled.

44:03.766 --> 44:05.267
Was that a good education?

44:05.268 --> 44:07.435
Oh, yeah.
We covered all the basics.

44:07.436 --> 44:09.229
Reading, writing and meth.

44:11.899 --> 44:13.191
You mean math.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.651
No.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.247
You mean meth, as in
methamphetamines?

44:18.248 --> 44:19.948
<i>Ooh.</i>

44:19.949 --> 44:21.449
Fancy!

44:22.910 --> 44:26.037
Sounds like somebody
got his Ged.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.583
I failed meth.

44:29.584 --> 44:32.085
I hated my lab partner.

44:32.086 --> 44:35.463
I think he was on drugs.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.092
Bubba J, you know
that's illegal.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.552
That's why I ran away.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.095
That's cowardly.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.638
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.891
I'm a lion.

44:48.269 --> 44:50.312
That makes you Dorothy.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.441
And Jose is the Tin Man,
Walter is Oz,

44:54.442 --> 44:57.819
and Peanut is
the ﬂying-ass monkey.

45:06.787 --> 45:08.330
Who's Achmed?

45:08.331 --> 45:11.625
Uh, he's the guy that comes in
and ... up the whole story.

45:12.919 --> 45:15.795
He makes it so we have
to take off our shoes

45:15.796 --> 45:17.589
before we go
through the castle.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.384
And who's the Wicked
Witch of the West?

45:21.385 --> 45:24.888
I think you know,
'cause she took all your money.

45:26.813 --> 45:29.142
Say good night, Bubba J.

45:29.143 --> 45:32.187
Good night!

45:35.149 --> 45:37.243
<i> In a world
where crime is rampant,</i>

45:37.244 --> 45:40.153
<i>and no one is willing
to make a stand...</i>

45:40.154 --> 45:43.073
- ...there <i>is</i> only one

45:43.074 --> 45:44.826
<i>who can take back the night.</i>

45:51.332 --> 45:53.250
So, what is it you do, Mr. Nut?

45:53.251 --> 45:54.501
I do nothing.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.753
I am rich.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.838
I mean really rich.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.924
Want to see my car?

46:15.273 --> 46:16.773
Who's there?

46:16.774 --> 46:18.233
Jeff-fuh?

46:18.234 --> 46:19.401
Who's there?

46:19.402 --> 46:22.201
Who are you?
Who are you?!

47:07.908 --> 47:09.242
How you doing, Peanut?

47:09.243 --> 47:11.120
- Doing pretty good.
How about you? -I'm fine.

47:11.121 --> 47:13.747
That's good, that's good,
that's good!

47:15.126 --> 47:17.250
- So, you're Batman?
- No, no, no.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.752
I'm Batnut.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.421
- Batnut?
- Yes.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.965
Batnut, nut-laced avenger
of the night.

47:23.966 --> 47:26.259
Is that why you're
talking like that?

47:26.260 --> 47:27.594
- Of course.
- Batnut?

47:27.595 --> 47:29.438
- Yes. -You sound more like
you're the Choker.

47:34.810 --> 47:37.270
Okay, shut up!

47:37.271 --> 47:38.521
I do the talking.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.443
You stand there
and try to look like

47:40.444 --> 47:42.193
you're doing something
besides just standing there.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.905
Look, do you really think
Batnut scares criminals?

47:46.906 --> 47:49.991
Of course. Especially
if they have a nut allergy.

47:55.331 --> 47:58.666
Face my honey-roasted justice!

47:58.667 --> 48:01.086
So it seems to me
like I'm standing next

48:01.087 --> 48:03.129
to a poor excuse
for a Batman.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.383
And I'm standing next to
a poor excuse for a white man.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.350
So, do you have any weapons?

48:15.351 --> 48:17.435
Of course. Batman has
the batarang.

48:17.436 --> 48:18.937
I have the nutarang.

48:18.938 --> 48:20.814
- The nutarang?
- Yes.

48:20.815 --> 48:23.191
It does exactly
what you think it does.

48:23.192 --> 48:26.236
But when it comes back,
I don't want to catch it.

48:28.364 --> 48:31.282
And I have two of them.
I call them the Dynamic Duo.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.912
And I keep them
near the bat pole.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.417
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.168
No more double entendres.

48:42.169 --> 48:43.586
Thank you.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.213
- Until the next one.
- Peanut!

48:45.214 --> 48:47.182
- Don't get testicle!
- Oh, come on!

48:53.347 --> 48:56.933
So like Batman, do you have a
signal in the sky to summon you?

48:56.934 --> 48:58.607
Well, I've been trying
to figure that out.

48:58.608 --> 49:00.854
First, I was gonna have
a big bat in the sky.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.275
Then I thought,
"No, that's Batman."

49:02.276 --> 49:03.488
Then I thought, "I know.

49:03.489 --> 49:05.484
I'll have one big nut
in the sky."

49:05.485 --> 49:07.527
Then I thought,
“No. That's Lance Armstrong."

49:12.074 --> 49:13.533
This is ridiculous.

49:13.534 --> 49:16.369
And I have everything Batman has
except one thing.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.539
- What?
- A butler.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.375
- Funny.
- Oh, come on, dude.

49:22.376 --> 49:23.844
- You'd make a great butler.
- No.

49:23.845 --> 49:25.879
Just go with it.
You're Batnut's butler.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.881
- Great.
- The Nutler!

49:31.218 --> 49:34.262
Now, Nutler,
go iron my cape

49:34.263 --> 49:35.856
and disinfect
my polyester bat shorts.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.392
- I'm not gonna be your butler.
- Nutler.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.560
Whatever.

49:40.561 --> 49:41.895
I'm not doing it.

49:41.896 --> 49:44.230
Oh, it's not like
you have anything else to do.

49:44.231 --> 49:45.401
What does that mean?

49:45.402 --> 49:46.696
Seriously, what do you do

49:46.697 --> 49:48.776
when the other guys
and I aren't here?

49:48.777 --> 49:51.946
Walk around looking for
other folks to stand next to?

49:53.574 --> 49:55.700
- You even already have
a butler name. -What?

50:05.586 --> 50:09.422
: Oh,
Dun-ham, bring me my tea.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.133
It's time to butter
the scones.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.602
: I could
even add a little bell.

50:13.603 --> 50:14.636
Ding-ding!

50:14.637 --> 50:16.763
Jef-fuh-fuh!

50:21.477 --> 50:22.810
I want my scones.

50:22.811 --> 50:24.479
I'm not taking
orders from you.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.699
: You would
if I did it in the voice.

50:26.700 --> 50:29.025
Jef-fuh-fuh!

50:29.026 --> 50:31.736
Time to polish
the nutarang.

50:31.737 --> 50:35.323
And please ﬂuff
the padding in my cup.

50:35.324 --> 50:37.617
I love that voice.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.461
I also like the
Darth Vader voice.

50:39.462 --> 50:41.496
I can do both
at the same time.

50:41.497 --> 50:44.374
I am your fuh-father,
Jef-fuh-fuh.

50:52.591 --> 50:56.469
Use the Fuh-force,
Jef-fuh-fuh.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.471
Why is Batman's voice
like that, anyway?

50:58.472 --> 51:00.390
I don't know.
Suit's too tight?

51:00.391 --> 51:02.809
: The suit's
a little tight, Alfred.

51:02.810 --> 51:05.812
It's kind of scrunching up
the Dynamic Duo.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.238
I actually think
I'm better than Batman.

51:09.239 --> 51:12.026
- How's that? -I have one extra
power that he does not.

51:12.027 --> 51:13.069
And that is?

51:13.070 --> 51:15.321
- Bat telepathy.
- Bat telepathy?

51:15.322 --> 51:19.158
Yes, it's like ES-Peanut.

51:19.159 --> 51:22.537
- I have the ability to read
your mind. -No, you...

51:22.538 --> 51:24.038
Don't!

51:31.005 --> 51:32.547
Come on, that's...

51:32.548 --> 51:34.841
Ridiculous!

51:34.842 --> 51:37.427
It's like I knew
what you were gonna say

51:37.428 --> 51:38.761
right when you did.

51:38.762 --> 51:40.605
Well, of course you
did, because...

51:40.606 --> 51:42.765
I like to stare at
Justin Bieber pictures

51:42.766 --> 51:45.810
and dream about being
his secret girlfriend.

51:52.860 --> 51:54.527
Now you're
making stuff up.

51:54.528 --> 51:56.195
- Am I?
- Yes, but <i>I...</i>

51:56.196 --> 51:59.699
Put honey in certain places
for my little doggy to lick.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.287
Will you stop...

52:04.288 --> 52:07.707
Me before I oil myself up
and go clubbing.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.458
What's your name?

52:10.713 --> 52:13.338
I can make you talk.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.173
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

52:16.717 --> 52:18.219
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

52:22.181 --> 52:23.514
Are you finished?

52:26.977 --> 52:28.069
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

52:29.563 --> 52:32.649
Are there any Batman villains
that frighten you?

52:32.650 --> 52:34.150
- Oh, yeah.
- Which one?

52:34.151 --> 52:36.694
The clown that dresses weird
and wears too much makeup.

52:36.695 --> 52:37.779
Right.

52:37.780 --> 52:40.365
So any of the Orange
County housewives.

52:41.742 --> 52:44.077
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

52:44.078 --> 52:46.079
That's another thing...
does Batman fart?

52:46.080 --> 52:47.580
<i>I... I don't know.</i>

52:47.581 --> 52:50.083
Yeah, but his are
probably just like him...

52:50.084 --> 52:52.585
silent but deadly.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.295
Wait! Did you hear that?

52:54.296 --> 52:56.594
- No.
- Then you're already dead.

52:59.218 --> 53:00.561
What?

53:02.179 --> 53:04.263
Thanks.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.933
You know what the worst
superhero name is?

53:06.934 --> 53:08.351
Green Lantern.

53:08.352 --> 53:09.894
Named after a lamp...
it's like,

53:09.895 --> 53:12.939
"I'm the Silver Toaster...
stand back or I'll warm you!"

53:14.274 --> 53:16.109
Another bad name
is The Flash.

53:16.110 --> 53:18.078
The Flash... is he
gonna fight crime

53:18.079 --> 53:19.445
or open his trench coat

53:19.446 --> 53:21.489
and show you his
caped crusader?

53:22.783 --> 53:25.618
His caped crusader?

53:25.619 --> 53:27.787
His partners in crime.

53:27.788 --> 53:29.789
His henchmen.

53:29.790 --> 53:32.166
His chicka-chicka-wah-wah!

53:33.961 --> 53:37.296
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

53:37.297 --> 53:38.469
Captain America is cool.

53:38.470 --> 53:42.051
Captain Mexico is
his mortal enemy.

53:42.052 --> 53:44.387
Always trying
to take his job.

53:53.147 --> 53:54.820
And, of course,
Captain America's shield

53:54.821 --> 53:58.025
is built by Captain China.

53:59.987 --> 54:02.331
- Captain China? -Yeah, and
sometimes he teams up

54:02.332 --> 54:04.490
with the fearsome
fighter from France.

54:04.491 --> 54:05.867
What does he do?

54:05.868 --> 54:08.161
Just bitch, wait for help,
then surrenders.

54:17.129 --> 54:18.676
Are there any
superheroes you like?

54:18.677 --> 54:20.882
- Duh. Wonder Woman.
- Sure.

54:20.883 --> 54:22.554
- Yeah. I would never
date her, though. -Why?

54:22.555 --> 54:24.677
She has that lasso
that makes you tell the truth.

54:24.678 --> 54:25.973
She ties you up,

54:25.974 --> 54:27.848
and you think it's
getting kinky, and then...

54:27.849 --> 54:30.850
"Of course I want
to nail your sister."

54:35.355 --> 54:38.107
"Yes, those stars do make
your ass look fat."

54:39.610 --> 54:41.819
“No, it wasn't really
just a rash."

54:43.947 --> 54:46.908
You know, last Halloween
some hot chick came to my door

54:46.909 --> 54:49.911
dressed as a hooker
and went, "Trick or treat!"

54:49.912 --> 54:51.245
I took both.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.843
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

54:57.461 --> 54:59.427
You know, I love
getting candy on Halloween,

54:59.428 --> 55:01.423
but the candy names
are in question.

55:01.424 --> 55:02.507
Like what?

55:02.508 --> 55:03.976
Don't ever let me
hear you say,

55:03.977 --> 55:06.385
"I love 3 Musketeers."

55:06.386 --> 55:07.887
Oh, really?
Well, I'm sure

55:07.888 --> 55:10.848
you'll enjoy getting
a Blow Pop.

55:10.849 --> 55:12.391
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

55:12.392 --> 55:15.228
And I don't want
to know what happens

55:15.229 --> 55:17.732
when you bite
into an Oh Henry!

55:18.899 --> 55:20.742
You probably catch
the Skittles.

55:24.613 --> 55:27.865
And then end up
with a Sour Patch.

55:27.866 --> 55:29.867
I also don't want
a Butterfinger.

55:29.868 --> 55:32.041
I know where
that ... been.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.421
I do like Halloween
costumes, though.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.923
Yeah, you always have
a good one?

55:43.924 --> 55:44.925
Yeah, except one year

55:44.926 --> 55:46.676
when I dressed up
like a cat.

55:46.677 --> 55:47.927
- A cat?
- Yeah.

55:47.928 --> 55:49.555
There was an unfortunate
misunderstanding

55:49.556 --> 55:51.603
after Bubba J drank
a 12-pack.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.693
Want to see the scratches?

55:54.694 --> 55:55.935
No.

55:55.936 --> 55:57.854
Want to see how
he scratched me?

55:57.855 --> 55:59.063
No.

55:59.064 --> 56:00.314
You want to see
my sidekick?

56:00.315 --> 56:01.612
No. Wait. What?

56:01.613 --> 56:04.569
My sidekick.
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah.

56:04.570 --> 56:05.945
You have a sidekick?

56:05.946 --> 56:07.198
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah.

56:07.199 --> 56:09.323
A sidekick for Batnut?

56:09.324 --> 56:10.616
Yep.

56:10.617 --> 56:12.243
Is it José?

56:12.244 --> 56:13.744
Maybe.

56:13.745 --> 56:15.288
Get him out.

56:15.289 --> 56:17.832
Look-look-look-look-
look-look-look!

56:31.471 --> 56:32.930
Who are you?

56:32.931 --> 56:34.682
- That's my sidekick.
- Robin?

56:34.683 --> 56:37.059
Ruben.

56:40.105 --> 56:41.314
I am Ruben.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.238
I see. So you're
a superhero, too.

56:43.239 --> 56:44.275
<i>Si.</i>

56:44.276 --> 56:45.651
- Okay, José.
- Ruben!

56:45.652 --> 56:47.028
Sorry. Ruben.

56:47.029 --> 56:48.779
How can I help you, citizen?

56:48.780 --> 56:52.158
Ooh! Excellent question,
non-citizen.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.130
- So, do you have super powers?
- Si.

57:01.131 --> 57:02.418
What are they?

57:02.419 --> 57:05.046
I can hit you with my stick.

57:05.047 --> 57:08.007
Or poke you in the eye.

57:08.008 --> 57:11.761
If you eat me,
I burn your ass.

57:11.762 --> 57:14.180
And if you mix him
with bad guacamole,

57:14.181 --> 57:18.225
he can give you
the cha-cha-chas.

57:18.226 --> 57:21.020
So, uh, Ruben, are you
a fan of Batman and Robin?

57:21.021 --> 57:22.862
- No. -Then why are you
dressed like this?

57:22.863 --> 57:24.858
Señor Peanut put
these clothes on me.

57:24.859 --> 57:27.485
I could not stop him.

57:27.486 --> 57:29.195
Why couldn't you stop him?

57:29.196 --> 57:32.621
He doesn't have any arms.

57:46.004 --> 57:49.966
He is not Batnut.
He is Captain A-Hole.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.509
Hey!

57:51.510 --> 57:53.137
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.642
Well, I think
it's a good costume.

57:56.643 --> 57:58.142
I wanted to dress
as something

57:58.143 --> 58:00.059
that gave me nightmares.

58:00.060 --> 58:01.937
Like a big plate of nachos?

58:03.647 --> 58:05.940
No, I wanted to dress
as an ugly whore.

58:05.941 --> 58:07.400
Why didn't you?

58:07.401 --> 58:09.235
I could not find a mask

58:09.236 --> 58:10.704
that looks like your sister.

58:16.451 --> 58:18.077
- Hey!
- Wait a minute.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.079
What the hell?!

58:19.080 --> 58:20.329
Ha-ha.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.330
Jerk!

58:21.331 --> 58:22.672
All right. Look. <i>So...</i>

58:22.673 --> 58:23.918
Hey, José, for Halloween,

58:23.919 --> 58:26.252
why don't you and your
family all line up

58:26.253 --> 58:27.800
and go as a picket fence?

58:29.881 --> 58:31.258
You know what scares José?

58:31.259 --> 58:34.343
A deep fryer
and cheese up his ass.

58:34.344 --> 58:37.513
I know someone else who has
cheese up their ass.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.556
Yeah? Who?

58:38.557 --> 58:39.683
Ask your mother.

58:39.684 --> 58:41.401
All right!

58:43.270 --> 58:44.645
Okay, look
at Batnut's sidekick,

58:44.646 --> 58:45.987
do you have
any responsibilities?

58:45.988 --> 58:47.196
- No.
- Nothing?

58:47.197 --> 58:49.033
- You don't even drive a car?
- No.

58:49.034 --> 58:51.444
That would be stick on stick.

58:51.445 --> 58:54.870
And that's illegal
in some states.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.164
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

59:00.370 --> 59:02.455
But Ruben, you don't have
any powers?

59:02.456 --> 59:05.416
Or limbs.

59:05.417 --> 59:06.917
How do you stop villains?

59:06.918 --> 59:07.960
Mace.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.462
Mace.

59:09.463 --> 59:11.841
It'd been funny
if he said pepper spray.

59:18.055 --> 59:20.014
Why didn't you say
pepper spray?

59:20.015 --> 59:22.814
You cannot say that
without moving your lips.

59:33.195 --> 59:36.447
- So, Ruben, how do you spray
the bad guys? -Well...

59:36.448 --> 59:39.793
Uh! This is a family show.

59:42.871 --> 59:44.914
Have you ever been
a sidekick before?

59:44.915 --> 59:47.374
No, but he's been a side dish.

59:47.375 --> 59:51.253
Get ii?! A side dish!

59:51.254 --> 59:53.589
With cheese
for your mother.

59:53.590 --> 59:54.637
All right!

59:56.426 --> 59:58.347
So, look, a sidekick
is there in case

59:58.348 --> 01:00:00.222
- the superhero gets
into trouble. -Si.

01:00:00.223 --> 01:00:02.598
What do you do
if Batnut gets beat up?

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.017
I just laugh.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:09.480
And then I put
the video on YouTube.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:12.691
He gets lots of hits.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:15.861
Who's the piñata now,...?

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:25.246
So on Halloween when you guys
aren't Batnut and Ruben,

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:26.590
do you go trick-or-treating?

01:00:26.591 --> 01:00:28.332
Si. We go home to home.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.875
- Ah.
- Unless he's out of work.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.419
- What? -Then he goes
Home Depot to Home Depot.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:38.050
So, José, what did you dress up
as last year?

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.344
- I went as a Mexican Boy Scout.
- I see.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:43.055
Yeah, he helped
an old lady cross the border.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:49.019
So, José,
where'd you get the mask?

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.479
Señor Peanut.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.572
All he needed was a piece of
material with two holes in it.

01:00:52.573 --> 01:00:54.068
- Right.
- So that's my underwear.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.028
His mask is your underwear?

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.822
Is that why
my eyes are burning?

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.409
Thank you, Taco Bell.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.453
Peanut?

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.081
He looks like something
a gay cat coughed up.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.584
Hey!

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:13.669
All right, all right, look,
as Batnut and Ruben,

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.213
do you guys have an archenemy,
some sort of villain?

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.384
<i>Si, Señor.</i>

01:01:17.385 --> 01:01:18.552
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

01:01:18.553 --> 01:01:19.767
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?

01:01:19.768 --> 01:01:21.135
You see him every day.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:22.928
What?

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:26.182
He said, "You see
him every day."

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.349
I heard him.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.851
Then why did you
say, "What?"

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.102
What?

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.271
: He said,
"Why did you say what?"

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.740
Why are you yelling?

01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:36.817
Because you keep
saying, "What?"

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.154
Apparently, he
cannot hear us.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:41.572
I can hear you fine.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:42.790
He's getting old.

01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:44.533
- What?
- See?

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.243
He said, "What?" again.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.913
It's downhill after 50.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.123
He's been farting
more now, too.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:55.586
I know. Old guys do that.

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.129
Excuse me.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.757
I think he farted again.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.300
At least he's polite.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:02.760
You guys?

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:04.136
Yes, Jeff.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.680
It's okay to get old, Señor.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.724
It happens to everyone.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.477
Unless you die first.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:12.811
My hearing is fine.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.280
Then why
are you yelling?

01:02:14.281 --> 01:02:15.481
I don't know!

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:16.649
He's confused.

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.526
No, I'm not!

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:20.778
And in denial.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.329
What are you talking about?!

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:24.495
And he's senile.

01:02:24.496 --> 01:02:25.741
Yup.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.326
- It's okay.
- Excuse me!

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.662
Why? Did you fart again?

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:33.332
- No.
- So it was just the once?

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:36.502
What would happen
if I snapped and killed you?

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.337
That would
make you homicidal.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:40.756
Exactly.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.717
So you're admitting
you're gay?

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:53.435
How do you get gay?

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.154
You just admitted
you're homicidal.

01:02:55.155 --> 01:02:56.355
What?!

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:58.440
There he goes again.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.234
- Peanut?
- Batnut. -And Ruben.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.860
Do you guys have
an archenemy?

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.033
- Si.
- Who is it?

01:03:03.034 --> 01:03:04.863
- You.
- Me? -Si.

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.824
Our archenemy is in José's box.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:08.370
The only thing
in the box over there

01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:09.620
is the little
ventriloquist dummy

01:03:09.621 --> 01:03:11.161
that kind of looks like me.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:12.379
Right. Get it out.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.498
You want me
to pull out Little Jeff?

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:27.761
You can try that
if you want to!

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:32.725
Can you make that
talk, too, Señor?

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.232
Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:37.566
Add to your new act.

01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:38.736
"Hi. I'm Little Jeff."

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:42.276
It's going to
be a short show.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.527
Oh!

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:46.575
Look, the only thing...

01:03:46.576 --> 01:03:48.414
This is him right here.
This is it.

01:03:48.415 --> 01:03:49.910
This is...
this is your enemy.

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:51.994
That's it. Oh, look,
check it out! Look! Look!

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.165
It is my archenemy.

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:54.585
I love this!
This is fantastic!

01:03:54.586 --> 01:03:56.915
This is just Little
J.D., the dummy of me.

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.291
<i>I... Oh, you forgot his mask.</i>

01:03:58.292 --> 01:04:00.168
Get the mask out.
Quick, get the mask!

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.420
- He has a mask?
- Yeah.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:02.591
- It's here, Señor.
- Okay.

01:04:02.592 --> 01:04:03.759
Look at this.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.759
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.384
The Loser!

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.268
I am The Loser.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.436
Peanut?

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.480
Wait, wait.
He has to say it again.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:21.523
- I am a Loser.
- We got it.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.492
And why do you
think this is funny?

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:24.818
He's a loser!

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:26.162
Maybe it's you, Señor.

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:27.571
I know that.

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.239
Yeah, it's Dunham
and Dunham-er.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.285
We are the Losers!

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:34.581
This is stupid.

01:04:34.582 --> 01:04:36.500
Ask him about
his powers, Señor.

01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:37.966
Yeah, yeah,
come on, ask him!

01:04:37.967 --> 01:04:39.792
I'm not talking
to a doll.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.134
Ah, come on, ask him
about his powers.

01:04:45.135 --> 01:04:46.301
Please, Señor.

01:04:46.302 --> 01:04:48.142
- Come on!
- All right, all right.

01:04:48.143 --> 01:04:50.677
So, uh, Loser, what
are your powers?

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:52.646
You talked to a ... doll.

01:04:52.647 --> 01:04:54.181
You're a loser.
Oh, my God.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:01.772
You need a big "L“
on your forehead, too.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:04.233
Okay, so, does he
have any powers?

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.406
- Nope.
- Losers.

01:05:05.407 --> 01:05:06.777
All right.

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:08.780
He's just like you,
except everything is smaller.

01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:10.239
Not everything.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:14.159
Okay, <i>so</i> does he have
one power at all?

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.332
Yes, he has one power.

01:05:15.333 --> 01:05:16.537
What is it?

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:18.539
He can repulse women
with a single sentence.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.790
Watch.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.875
I am a ventriloquist.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:31.885
So, does he do anything?

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.058
He plays with dolls.

01:05:33.059 --> 01:05:34.221
That's me.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.099
And he plays with
himself for hours.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.683
That's more him than me.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:41.019
Does he have a
secret hideout?

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.192
- Yup.
- The closet.

01:05:42.193 --> 01:05:43.856
- All right.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:44.858
- Two words.
- What?

01:05:44.859 --> 01:05:46.066
Blue Prius.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.284
All right.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:55.701
Señor, that is Spanish

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.453
for, "I drive a gay car."

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.457
The Loser Cruiser.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.427
- I don't like the name
"The Loser." -You're right.

01:06:06.428 --> 01:06:08.389
- He probably isn't really
a loser. -Thank you.

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:11.467
I say we get a new mask for him
that's shaped like a

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.552
- Okay.
- I am The Wuss.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.097
- Okay, I'm curious
about something. -Shoot.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:18.894
- Every superhero has
an archenemy. -Yes.

01:06:18.895 --> 01:06:20.608
- But so does every villain.
- That's true.

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.855
- So does The Loser have
an archenemy? -Of course.

01:06:22.856 --> 01:06:24.438
- Only one.
- Who's that?

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:27.608
The evil, the ruthless
Al E. Moaney.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.029
Get it? Alimony?

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.197
I got it.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.493
And there's only one superhero

01:06:34.494 --> 01:06:36.368
who can save me
from Al E. Moaney.

01:06:36.369 --> 01:06:37.743
Who's that?

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:40.042
He's strong, but stupid,
wealthy, but easily manipulated.

01:06:40.043 --> 01:06:41.205
And that is?

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.581
New Husbandman.

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:51.715
But she's not
that stupid, right?

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:54.134
Well, legally,
per the agreement,

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.808
I'm not allowed
to talk about this.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:59.181
But we can?

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:00.354
Yeah, you're good.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.477
To be continued!

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.401
- To the closet. -And that's
Batnut and Ruben.

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:17.074
I... I... I... I...
keel... keel... keel... keel...

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:19.041
<i>you.. you... you..
you... you...</i>

01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:20.582
<i>This neighborhood...</i>

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.873
<i>...this house...</i>

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:30.546
<i>...these people...</i>

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.714
- You want something to drink?
- Thanks.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:37.135
<i>Infidels. I keel you</i>

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:39.471
<i>...are in for the shock</i>

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.473
<i>of their lives.</i>

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:44.818
<i>What will be left...</i>

01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:46.979
Wooh!

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.814
Ah... uh-uh.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:53.032
<i>...when all is revealed...</i>

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.865
Ooh. Hmm.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.160
Oh, too heavy.

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:03.870
How am I going to keel them?

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.498
<i>...and the dark
secret comes out?</i>

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:11.795
Oh! Ooh!

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.297
Ooh!

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:14.631
Achmed?!

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.852
;
No...!

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:53.462
Good evening,
Savannah infidels!

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:59.509
So, uh, Achmed,

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.932
why are you
dressed like this?

01:09:00.933 --> 01:09:02.511
Oh, you told me to dress

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:05.390
like the scariest thing
I could think of.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.725
What are you?

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.060
I am a woman.

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:11.063
Just a woman?

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:14.399
Worse.
An American woman.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.401
- Ha, ha.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.569
Silence! Impossible.

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:23.413
What's <i>so</i> scary about
an American woman?

01:09:23.415 --> 01:09:25.160
They can vote.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.955
Yeah, and they can drive.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.173
Not the Asian ones.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.419
That is incredibly racist.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.880
Yet factually correct.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.298
How do you know?

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:39.966
I learned it in Cosmo.

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.385
<i>Cosmo?</i>

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:42.603
I took the quiz.

01:09:42.604 --> 01:09:43.929
- The quiz?
- Yes.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.682
The quiz,
"Are You a Racist...?"

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.475
- I see.
- And guess what?

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:50.185
- What?
♪ Ta-da! I

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.188
I see.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.232
So what else scares you
about American women?

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:56.858
Besides everything?

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.568
- The money.
- The money?

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:01.154
You marry an American woman,
and in no time,

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:04.950
all your money for bombs
is gone!

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:08.956
She blows money on shoes, I have
no money to blow up the Jews.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:12.833
What?!

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:14.876
I don't mean just the Jews,
but it rhymes...

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.795
"shoes" and "Jews."

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:21.466
I-I could've said, you know,
"slacks" and "blacks.“

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.802
But "Jews" is funnier.

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:25.679
And I like black folks.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.527
Oh, we white chicks
love the black guys.

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.356
I think the expression is
"once you go black,

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:39.151
you never go back to white guys
or medium to small animals."

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:40.654
Something like that.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:46.408
Hey, I see you looking at me.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.909
What do you think?

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.162
Uh, nice hair.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:54.634
Oh, yes, and I promise you,
the drapes match the curtains.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:02.466
What?! I was talking about
my beard, you idiots!

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:04.676
I don't have carpet carpet.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.679
Well, I must say, your costume
is-is not what I expected.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.180
- You mean the blonde hair?
- Right.

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:10.934
Well, I used to be
a suicide bomber,

01:11:10.935 --> 01:11:13.518
now I'm a suicide bombshell.

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:15.896
And it's easy for me
to play a woman,

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:20.692
because after the explosion,
my man-junk was never recovered.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:23.111
I should've worn a cup.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.404
A cup?

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:27.949
But a good one, like the one
Venus Williams wears.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.954
What?!

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.956
I love that guy
and his brother.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:37.965
So as a skeleton...

01:11:37.966 --> 01:11:39.961
What did you call me?!

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.087
A skeleton.

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:44.758
Oh, you're just trying
to flatter me.

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:48.220
I still need to lose
ten more pounds.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.554
You're all bones.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:50.555
I know.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.400
Eat your heart out, Angelina!

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.812
Seriously,
eat something, anything,

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.523
a ... sandwich, whatever.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.817
So, uh, what size
dress is that?

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.444
You never ask a woman that.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:06.071
But if you must know,

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.824
I am now a size zero.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.793
How'd you get down
to a size zero?

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:12.744
My weight loss program.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.663
Suicide bombing.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.914
What?

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:19.918
I lost 200 pounds
in 0.2 seconds.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:22.045
Now I can eat
whatever I want.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.422
Seriously, it goes
right through me.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:26.925
Yeah, give me
a cheeseburger and a bucket.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.180
Well, you look good.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.683
No, I'm not. I'm bloated.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.685
I feel fat.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:38.186
I have cramps.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.481
I'm going to cry.

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.482
What's wrong?

01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:44.442
I don't know!

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:47.196
Don't touch me!

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.287
<i>Achmed...</i>

01:12:50.288 --> 01:12:52.581
No, no! Achmedina.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:55.956
Do you dress
like this often?

01:12:55.957 --> 01:12:57.831
No, only when I want
free drinks.

01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:00.292
Am I right, ladies?!

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:08.800
Someone told me yesterday I look
like a Victoria's Secret model.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:09.801
Really?

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.303
I know what their secret is.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:14.306
- What?

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:16.641
Well, I must say, I
like your pink dress.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:19.978
Oh! Fuchsia.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.320
- Well, you look good.
- Right.

01:13:21.321 --> 01:13:23.316
Can you tell
I had some work done?

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:34.409
Yes, the last time I had

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.163
this much plastic on my chest,
it exploded.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:42.250
So, Jeffrey...

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.837
do you like my hoochers?

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:48.924
That's, uh, "hooters."

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:52.844
You can call them
whatever you want.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:55.263
You just have to
buy me dinner first.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.140
Hey!

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:59.143
MY eyes are up here!

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:04.522
My hoochers do not talk.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.023
But of course
you could make them talk

01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:07.197
if you wanted to, couldn't you?

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.743
Hell, you could even
make my voice

01:14:11.744 --> 01:14:14.538
come out of my vajayjay
if you wanted to.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:20.538
Or as I call it,
my terror cave.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:23.500
Am I right, ladies?!

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:30.674
Your carrot cake?

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:32.926
What?

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:35.053
I said "terror cave."

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.846
Oh, I thought you said...

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:38.690
thought you said carrot cake.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.269
What the hell?!

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.739
What now, you looking
for my frosting?

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.737
Okay, but it's
sour cream based.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:58.036
Wait a minute,
you misunderstood what I said?

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:06.835
You need to get some help
really soon, I'm telling you.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:09.838
Look, Achmed, I don't think
this costume is that scary.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.381
Oh, really?

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:13.259
What if I came to your door?
Ding-dong.

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.301
Remember that night
at Applebee's?

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:19.222
I'm carrying your child.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.566
Yeah, that would be scary.

01:15:20.567 --> 01:15:21.933
And it's worse for you.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.935
When an angry blonde woman
comes to your door,

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:27.486
she doesn't want candy,
she wants half.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.569
So where you're from, are
there female suicide bombers?

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.787
We're pushing for it.

01:15:33.788 --> 01:15:34.821
Why?

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:37.657
It's a lot easier
than divorce.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:40.744
Think about it.

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:42.787
And I have been
working on a new weapon.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:43.788
A new weapon?

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.166
Just for
female suicide bombers.

01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:46.207
What's that?

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.175
A tam-bomb.
Just pull the string.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.804
You know that's a good one.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:00.977
I'm changing the subject.

01:16:00.978 --> 01:16:02.682
Do you like scary movies?

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:04.184
Oh, yes. My favorites are

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:07.979
<i>I Know What You Did
Last Ramadan...</i>

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.566
<i>Dr. Jekyll and Hide
or We'll All Be Killed!</i>

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.736
<i>But my favorite is
Silence! Of the Lambs.</i>

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:18.073
And thank God
they are silent.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:20.873
Oh, if the lambs
could talk...

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:24.996
Achmed, could we please
stop with the sheep jokes?

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.588
- There's children watching.

01:16:26.589 --> 01:16:27.799
- Really?
- Right.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.959
- Then it's time for the talk.
- What?

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.338
When a man and a sheep
love each other very much...

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.511
Will you stop it?

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:42.263
That's what the sheep
always say.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:46.059
That's why you have to go
with a lamb... they're silent.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.519
Hold on.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.190
After the show, will you, uh, go
buy me some feminine products?

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:55.110
You know,
like some Summer's Eve.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:58.321
I'm not feeling fresh.

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:01.326
I think the carrots
are spoiled.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.126
Or I may have
a hummus infection.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.541
You're kind of a mess.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:12.585
Yes, but a hot mess, no?

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.420
And can I tell you a secret?

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:15.672
Sure.

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:18.591
: I kind of like
dressing like this.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:21.596
Seriously, you should
give it a try, again.

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:26.307
Give it a second chance.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.060
I have never dressed
like a woman.

01:17:28.061 --> 01:17:30.270
You mean in public.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:35.900
I know, what happens on the
tour bus stays on the tour bus.

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:37.903
<i>Susan.</i>

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.823
Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.533
You guys have
been awesome!

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:45.535
Thanks for coming tonight!

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.520
Thank you!

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.164
Yay, Roadie!

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.630
Thanks again, you guys!
