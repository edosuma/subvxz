00:37.537 --> 00:38.913
Had a big one, Dr. C?

00:38.997 --> 00:41.458
Another day, another life.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.084
Oh, hell yeah.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.798
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:49.924 --> 00:50.967
Thank you.

00:51.050 --> 00:55.096
And he is out. Can't feel a thing.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.017
That's what she said.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.811
I mean, I'm good, but I can't fix that.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.190
Okay. Give me a 5/1 suture
on a C1 needle.

01:05.272 --> 01:06.709
Stitch to cannula.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.817
Phone.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.112
- Hello?
- How ya doing, pal?

01:11.196 --> 01:13.114
It's Kenny. You got a sec?

01:13.698 --> 01:14.699
Ah, yeah.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.160
Father of the groom. Are you psyched?

01:17.243 --> 01:19.621
- Yeah...
- Look, I know you got stuff.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.581
But we got a bit of a jam going on,

01:21.664 --> 01:24.876
a lot of people didn't check off
whether they want steak or fish.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.629
I was wondering if you had an idea

01:27.712 --> 01:31.424
what your side of the family
would want more,

01:31.508 --> 01:33.218
Then we don't have to over-order.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.969
- Uh...
- Take your time.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.848
Well, maybe a steak by a little.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.642
Oh, that's great!

01:40.725 --> 01:42.435
- So, would you say...
- No.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.188
...maybe 60% steak, 40% fish or...

01:45.271 --> 01:49.192
Uh, you know, I can still help you pay
for the wedding if you'd let me...

01:49.275 --> 01:51.319
No, no! I got this. All good here, pal.

01:51.402 --> 01:55.240
The wedding, the hotel rooms. Mmm!

01:55.824 --> 01:58.868
Yeah. Pinky Toe! Get down! Down!
Get her down!

01:58.952 --> 02:00.387
She shouldn't be up here.

02:00.411 --> 02:03.206
Uh, you know what?
Uh, could you hold on for a second?

02:03.289 --> 02:05.542
Yeah, not a problem.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.627
No, no, no! Take her off the table.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.713
Because she's licking the cookies,
and, yes, I'll still eat them.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.884
Hello? Ugh! Damn it!

02:17.595 --> 02:19.722
- Hey.
- Hi!

02:19.806 --> 02:22.559
Can you believe it's in five days?

02:22.642 --> 02:24.435
It's like, is this really happening?

02:24.519 --> 02:26.396
I mean in a good way!

02:26.479 --> 02:27.522
Yeah, it's great.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.150
I just have one question for you
as a doctor.

02:30.233 --> 02:34.821
Um, I read about this candy being recalled
due to salmonella.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.699
And I was buying candies
for the wedding...

02:37.782 --> 02:39.468
Of course, now I can't think of the brand.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.286
You know what? Maybe text it later.

02:41.369 --> 02:46.040
It was a peppermint bark,
and also a drizzled peanut brittle.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.501
Very nice.
Me and the girls were taste-testing.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.921
But now I'm reading
salmonella could be fatal?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.591
Well, actually, that's pretty rare.

02:55.216 --> 02:58.469
I mean, the only deaths I've seen reported
are children under three.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.015
Oh, thank God! Yay!
Okay, well, mine are older.

03:02.098 --> 03:05.935
So 15 is okay then, right?
Even if she got her period late?

03:06.019 --> 03:09.397
What the hell are we...
Here, hand me the phone. Hi.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.651
Hey! Okay, we're done bothering you, pal.
Go back to doing whatever you were doing.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.278
Sounds good. See you.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.866
I wanna talk to you.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.328
I am so sorry
I'm such an embarrassment to you!

03:23.411 --> 03:27.123
I just wanted to know if my family
was in jeopardy from salmonella!

03:27.206 --> 03:30.084
You couldn't google it
like everything else you google?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.711
So now I over-google?

03:31.794 --> 03:35.340
You wasted the man's time!
He's a heart doctor.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.760
- Did you not hear the beepy things?
- I know how beeps work!

03:38.843 --> 03:41.012
They were normal beeps, not long beeps!

03:41.095 --> 03:43.348
I never would have bothered him
during a long beep!

03:43.431 --> 03:45.576
Oh, my God. That's so cute.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.810
The toothbrush for you,
the stethoscope for Tyler.

03:47.894 --> 03:48.954
You like it?

03:48.978 --> 03:51.773
I will pay for it
like every other girl's parents do!

03:51.856 --> 03:53.375
- And it's gonna be great!
- It was Isaac's idea.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.236
Of course it is!
You're an amazing father!

03:56.319 --> 03:58.905
- You're just tense!
- I'm not tense!

04:00.448 --> 04:03.618
Okay! Hey, everybody!

04:03.701 --> 04:07.538
Grapes of Wrath, Rose, good choice.
You still gotta read the book, though.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.475
- Have you read it, Dad?
- I'm gonna read it with you.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.419
Tyler, you're gonna take him to practice?
That's not gonna stress you out?

04:12.502 --> 04:13.771
- Oh, yeah, no big deal.
- All right.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.856
I'm gonna go to the airport
and pick up Uncle Seymour.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.048
- Who's that?
- He's Dad's grand-uncle.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.926
He's the oldest living Lustig.

04:20.009 --> 04:23.596
Come on. You met him in Miami.
He's got all those great stories?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.139
He's got one leg?

04:25.223 --> 04:27.684
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, you're gonna love him.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.978
What are you doing?
Why're you walking like this?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.313
- Are they too tight on you?
- No, my feet are swollen.

04:32.397 --> 04:36.317
- I'll go to Penney's. I'll return them.
- No, they fit. I'm just breaking them in.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.987
It's so she doesn't walk like that
at the wedding, Mr. Lustig.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.670
- Okay, okay. What's my favorite candy bar?
- The Whatchamacallit.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.408
- Who's my favorite first daughter?
- Me.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.826
- I love you.
- Love you. Bye.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.120
- I love you.
- Thank you, Mr. Lustig.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.634
Here they come.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.767
Seymour!

05:09.851 --> 05:13.187
- You got him from here?
- Oh, you're not his nurse?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.732
Sir, I work for the airline.
I'm not a nurse.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.484
What? No, I was saying
because of the wheelchair...

05:18.568 --> 05:21.696
This is an airport wheelchair.
And I'm actually gonna need it back.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.156
Someone needs it more, sir.

05:23.239 --> 05:27.744
Oh! Someone needs it more than this guy?
Okay. Okay.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.878
How was your trip, pal?

05:39.505 --> 05:40.965
Oh. Oh!

05:42.258 --> 05:43.258
Sorry.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.678
What?

05:46.262 --> 05:48.639
- No legs?
- Yeah. Why?

05:48.723 --> 05:52.477
I thought he still had one.
You didn't tell me.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.605
Well, maybe you never asked.
That's diabetes. Works fast.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.482
- Terrible.
- Yeah.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.025
Okay, anything else? I'm at work.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.611
Okay. Why is he alone?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.780
What, you think I got time
to come in early?

06:03.863 --> 06:06.616
World doesn't stop, bud.
I'm running a pharmacy here.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.136
Uh, look, just call me later
and I'll give you all the instructions.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.454
Instructions? What instructions?

06:11.537 --> 06:14.165
You know, changing, his upkeep,
all that stuff.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.834
- So, he doesn't have a nurse?
- Oh, calm down!

06:16.918 --> 06:19.462
The doc says he can go 48 hours
without another cleaning

06:19.545 --> 06:21.672
- if you don't have time.
- What's a "cleaning"?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.424
- We'll talk. I got a customer.
- Wait!

06:23.508 --> 06:26.135
So, he's gonna stay
at the hotel all alone?

06:26.219 --> 06:29.055
You're putting him in a hotel? He's 87!

06:29.138 --> 06:32.600
It's just, there's so much going on
at the house already...

06:32.683 --> 06:34.102
The man is 87!

06:34.185 --> 06:36.145
Okay, I'm taking him home!

06:40.608 --> 06:44.695
Oh, so, how's the painting going, Seymour?
You still doing the ceramics?

06:44.779 --> 06:45.779
No.

07:01.295 --> 07:07.510
Just tell Sarah to help you.
Move my desk and fold out the sofa.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.388
You were gonna put him
in a hotel? With no legs?

07:10.471 --> 07:12.849
I didn't know about the no legs!

07:12.932 --> 07:14.976
It's fine. It's one person.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.604
Yes. Um, just... I'll be another hour.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.816
Tell everyone to meet at the house,
not the hotel.

07:21.899 --> 07:25.403
Our condos get a lot of divorced
dads who wanna be near their kids.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.881
They wanna at least feel like
they're living in a nice place.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.657
Yeah. We can do that. Absolutely.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.161
Easy to accommodate.
Not high-end, but very nice.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.871
Would you like to see some of our work?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.498
- Uh, well, Norman...
- I'm Kenny. Norman's my boss.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.958
Right, sorry.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.545
There's a Quality Lodge in Mineola
that we upgraded last year.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.632
Took it to a Two Diamond from Triple A.
This is almost unheard of.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.302
Uh, my daughter's
getting married there Saturday.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.430
Really? You're having a wedding
at a Quality Lodge?

07:52.513 --> 07:54.098
It's a Two Diamond.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.729
I only have a half an hour, but let me
get my car and we'll go for a drive...

07:59.812 --> 08:00.855
Let me drive you.

08:00.938 --> 08:04.025
We're a smaller company,
which is a positive.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.735
I get to be hands-on this way.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.905
I'll be there through the completion
of the entire project.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.245
- Hey! You're up!
- Where'd you go?

08:16.329 --> 08:19.999
This is my uncle, Seymour.
He just flew in from Florida.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.960
You were asleep, buddy.
I didn't wanna wake you.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.547
He was asleep.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.509
The rec center over there,
they went with us.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.594
Did the piping in the locker room.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.554
And updated the alarm system
in that building.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.390
I gotta go.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.308
We're almost home, Seymour.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.019
- Bathroom.
- Oh.

08:41.270 --> 08:45.274
We're almost done, okay?
Don't you have your pull-ups on?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.818
That's for piss, this is a shitting.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.990
Just about where we have to be.
Can you hold it in for four minutes?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.492
I can't.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.203
It's three minutes now.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.622
I can give you two.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.585
What happened? What happened?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.546
Oh, now it folds.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.297
Are you kidding me?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.676
I've never used
one of these before.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.010
What's taking so long?

09:13.094 --> 09:14.387
Seymour...

09:15.805 --> 09:18.349
Let's get... Let's get... Let's go.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.643
This is actually a good thing,

09:20.726 --> 09:23.521
because they have Dyson AirBlade
hand dryers,

09:23.604 --> 09:24.730
which I can show you.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.192
- It'd be good for your lobby bathrooms.
- Uh-huh.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.194
There's no, uh, handicapped room?

09:30.278 --> 09:33.698
No, I did not say that.
Well, put him on the phone, then.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.493
Isaac, did you tell your mom
I said not to shower?

09:37.577 --> 09:41.789
I did not... Because your mother says
your fingernails are filthy!

09:42.540 --> 09:45.376
They're both 23 years old.
Feels young to me.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.089
But they're in love, I guess.
So, who knows what's right.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.223
Nobody told me about the no legs at all.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.855
- Oh, somebody's in there.
- Don't see anybody.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.356
Okay, I'm done.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.196
I'm ready!

10:28.711 --> 10:30.338
Need those baby wipes.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.717
They both picked Tufts
so they could live together.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.844
She's in dental, he's in med.

10:36.927 --> 10:41.682
Okay. Good for him. I thought
he was just gonna be a dentist, too.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.769
There's a lot of great dentists
out there, Iris.

10:44.852 --> 10:48.481
Not all of them fondle people
when they're under the gas.

10:48.564 --> 10:49.690
All right, Ma.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.376
You guys, wait till you see Sarah's dress.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.527
I've seen her in it. It's so beyond,

10:53.611 --> 10:55.446
tasteful, not whore-y at all.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.823
I still wish you would've worn mine.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.408
I'm sorry, Grandma, I know. I just...

10:59.492 --> 11:00.993
She's wearing her own dress!

11:01.077 --> 11:03.829
You guys, I said I saw it.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.791
And look at Isaac! Oh, my God.

11:06.874 --> 11:10.002
I just wanna squeeze this head
till it explodes!

11:10.086 --> 11:14.090
Oh, I could just pull his face off
and put it on my night table,

11:14.173 --> 11:16.425
so I could see it before I go to bed!

11:16.509 --> 11:19.678
You should've seen this one in the play.
He was phenomenal.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.490
Oh, he was the only one you looked at
up there.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.432
Wait a minute. This is amazing.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.060
He was in a Broadway play?

11:26.143 --> 11:28.020
No. In camp.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.231
Oh, was it Juilliard camp?

11:30.314 --> 11:31.399
No.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.943
Was it a camp for theatrical children?

11:34.819 --> 11:35.861
No.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.447
It wasn't a special ed camp?

11:39.448 --> 11:41.158
No. It wasn't.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.743
Oh, thank God.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.663
Hey, hey! Here he is! The man himself.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.499
What are you doing?

11:48.582 --> 11:52.128
If anyone can figure out how to open up
the wheelchair out front, please!

11:52.211 --> 11:54.713
- Put my brother down!
- I will, Iris.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.090
Can somebody get a chair?

11:56.173 --> 11:59.009
This is my little girl,
the one who's getting married.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.429
Hi, Uncle Seymour.
Thank you so much for coming in.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.764
And little Rose.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.266
I thought he had one leg.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.184
No, he has less.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.229
Okay, give him a kiss, sweetie. That's it.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.398
Isaac, give your uncle a kiss.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.524
I-I, I did.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.861
Okay, then let's sit down here.

12:16.944 --> 12:21.699
Here you go, Seymour. That's it.
That's it, we're in there.

12:21.782 --> 12:26.871
Seymour, Seymour, it's Roberta.
How are you?

12:26.954 --> 12:29.248
I'm okay now. Finally.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.959
He put me in a car
with no air conditioning.

12:32.042 --> 12:35.629
Treated me like a dog.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.590
Isaac likes Jeremy Lin?

12:37.673 --> 12:41.260
And he's aware that Jeremy Lin
no longer plays for the New York Knicks?

12:41.343 --> 12:44.054
It's a very nice shirt, $7 at Modell's.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.557
- We're so late.
- Right.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.768
- I'm so sorry. Hi.
- Never too late. How are ya?

12:49.852 --> 12:52.521
Had to come see the man of the hour!

12:54.565 --> 12:56.567
Eighty-seven years old!

12:58.277 --> 13:00.821
- Mr. Lustig?
- That's right.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.366
Why did we invite them, again?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.410
They're our neighbors. We had to.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.787
He just gets so weird with me.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.475
You've known them all your life.
There's pictures of you as babies!

13:11.499 --> 13:13.626
- He still has them up in his room.
- Yeah.

13:13.709 --> 13:16.003
We are late because
Jared had a singing lesson.

13:16.086 --> 13:16.921
Oh, Jared.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.899
So, maybe you could do something
at the wedding?

13:18.923 --> 13:22.051
What was the one you sang at her Sweet 16?

13:22.134 --> 13:24.386
That was a Ray LaMontagne.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.263
But that was kind of our song.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.683
- Aw!
- Well, that's ancient history.

13:29.767 --> 13:34.146
Perfect. So maybe you could do
one of his songs with the band.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.689
It's not a band, it's a DJ.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.358
Sarah's cousin Jeddy.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.277
He's supposed to be incredible.
Kid's a whiz.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.654
He's 12 years old.

13:41.737 --> 13:45.241
Oh, and the father-daughter song.
We gotta pick one, kiddo.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.452
Think about Billy Joel.
I used to sing it to you as a kid, huh?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.371
- Okay.
- All right. See you in a little bit.

13:50.454 --> 13:54.875
Kenny. Kenny. I was telling Seymour
that the other father's rich.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.837
He's a surgeon.
Why didn't you let him pay for the band?

13:58.921 --> 14:00.965
We're fine, Iris. The kid's a whiz.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.892
I just gotta make sure
the groom's dad is happy.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.769
He's very, very...

14:15.312 --> 14:18.232
- This is the Executive Suite?
- Yes, yes.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.527
Do you have any bigger ones?

14:21.610 --> 14:24.864
No, no. This Executive Suite.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.157
I know. I...

14:27.825 --> 14:31.203
Maybe wondering if we can do something
to jazz it up.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.372
If you got anything leather.

14:34.540 --> 14:38.627
Old, uh, ottoman from old room.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.087
We keep one in basement.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.422
Okay. Good.

14:41.505 --> 14:47.219
What else? Maybe something...
More gadgets or more high-techy stuff or...

14:47.303 --> 14:48.303
I will look.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.389
There is toaster.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.724
Okay. You'll look.

14:51.807 --> 14:55.394
Oh! I got an old chandelier in my attic.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.480
You can install it
or I can get you one of my guys.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.732
We can do.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.984
You're the best, Hanan. Now we're cookin'.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.320
Let's keep thinking, come up with more.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.281
And we are not ever gonna tell anybody

15:07.364 --> 15:10.159
that this stuff
wasn't already in the room, right?

15:10.242 --> 15:12.244
Yes. Okay.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.455
Hey, how about this?

15:14.538 --> 15:16.040
How about we put a sign on,

15:16.707 --> 15:19.460
like, "Governor's Suite" or
"Thomas Jefferson Suite"?

15:19.543 --> 15:22.046
Can you do that quick?
Can you get that up by Wednesday?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.547
Yes. Yes.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.466
Yeah. All right. All right.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.365
You don't have to write "Doctor"
on that card.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.434
He's just a chiropractor,
so make it "Mister," okay?

15:35.517 --> 15:36.393
- Okay.
- Hey.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.938
Oh, hey. How was the hotel?

15:39.021 --> 15:42.191
Perfect. It's all set. What has happened?
Why you guys up?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.711
We couldn't finish the name tags
'cause everyone stayed so late.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.112
Yeah, so now we're gonna have to
rush the calligraphy.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.956
Sarah, you should've eloped
like Mom and Dad.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.866
- Nice.
- What's an "elope"?

15:51.533 --> 15:54.161
It's when you sneak off
and get married in secret.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.538
Yeah, we lived with our parents
for four months.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.832
We were too afraid to tell them.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.292
You lied to your parents?

16:00.376 --> 16:02.771
- No, no, it just never came up.
- It was a different time.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.381
I think it's romantic
that Dad couldn't wait to marry Mom.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.342
I was lucky.
Hey, come on. We gotta go to sleep.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.903
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yeah, I did.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.762
Let me smell.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.180
He's not lying. He did it.

16:13.263 --> 16:16.266
For the first time, he told the truth,
but let's go to sleep, guys.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.994
I just don't want you
to be cranky tomorrow.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.313
I'm begging you. Seymour's...
I don't want you to wake Seymour.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.607
He seems pretty knocked out to me.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.068
No, but we gotta be considerate.
Come on. Please?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.511
No, listen. I don't need to sleep.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.822
I'm gonna stretch Sarah's shoes, okay?
I'll be fine.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.156
You're crazy.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.577
Pinky Toe. Come here, come here.
Come here, come here. All right.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.247
God damn!

16:38.330 --> 16:40.040
- What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

16:40.124 --> 16:44.336
- What was that? Was that his head?
- Just go to sleep. Come on. Don't laugh.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.473
Daddy?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.394
What? What're you doing up?

17:00.477 --> 17:02.396
I'm just worried about the wedding.

17:02.479 --> 17:05.482
Hey. I get it, hon.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.028
Your sister's too young,
but this is what she wants to do.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.237
We gotta accept it.

17:10.695 --> 17:14.407
Oh, no. I was worried
whether it's gonna be nice enough.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.367
What?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.411
Well, Sarah has really good taste.

17:17.493 --> 17:20.622
I mean, she's understated,
but also sophisticated.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.415
- So I don't know if a DJ...
- Okay. Okay.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.436
- Look, she didn't say these things to me.
- She knows it's important to you.

17:25.461 --> 17:30.966
Right, I'm aware about her taste, okay?
I'm on it, the whole taste thing.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.343
Just... Why don't you go to sleep?
You got school.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.720
School's over. It's summer.

17:34.803 --> 17:37.681
Well, just sleep now, okay?
It's good for you.

17:39.099 --> 17:43.187
Oh, my God,
the three-hour difference!

17:43.270 --> 17:45.773
That's a big brain fart for me.

17:47.274 --> 17:51.528
Oh, sorry! Senior moment and I'm only 48.
Can you believe it?

17:52.112 --> 17:53.655
It's okay. Um...

17:54.198 --> 17:56.325
Maybe we could talk a bit later?

17:56.408 --> 17:57.868
Sure, sure.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.455
I just thought it'd be nice to chat
before the wedding and all the craziness.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.915
Get to know each other a little.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.292
Okay, so let's talk...

18:05.375 --> 18:07.002
So, all I really know is

18:07.086 --> 18:10.589
you're very pretty
and your husband wasn't around much.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.882
He played around a lot.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.079
- What?
- Are you out of your mind?

18:16.303 --> 18:18.097
I am not a lip-reader.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.433
- Hang the phone up. Say goodbye.
- Hello?

18:21.517 --> 18:25.479
I just wanted to ask how close
she wanted her table to the father!

18:25.562 --> 18:27.606
You have to make small talk first!

18:27.689 --> 18:29.608
At 4:00 in the morning!

18:29.691 --> 18:30.984
I didn't know!

18:31.068 --> 18:33.070
You didn't, then you did!

18:33.153 --> 18:36.240
What? I was about to get off
before you butted in!

18:36.323 --> 18:38.951
You know something?
I can't die first!

18:39.034 --> 18:40.744
I know it's wrong to say,

18:40.828 --> 18:44.623
but I couldn't handle you
ever making decisions all by yourself!

18:44.706 --> 18:47.501
It wouldn't be fair to you or the kids!

18:47.584 --> 18:51.046
Sweetheart, you need to
gain weight. You're too skinny.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.464
There you go, darling.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.300
Okay, all right. Looking good. Open.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.469
- Oh, yeah.
- Such service!

18:57.553 --> 19:01.014
Anybody figure out that chair?
The button situation?

19:01.098 --> 19:03.308
Good morning, Seymour.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.310
Seymour, you're here. You're good.
Go ahead.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.313
Eggs, Ma, eggs.
Hey, all right. Love you, pal. Love you.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.898
- Dad?
- Yeah, what?

19:09.982 --> 19:13.277
Is Mom gonna die soon
like you were yelling about?

19:13.360 --> 19:14.695
What's that, buddy?

19:14.778 --> 19:16.572
You were deciding who to die first?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.449
Oh, no, no, no.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.536
That's not gonna happen
for a very long time, pal.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.830
I was just saying that,
when it does happen,

19:24.913 --> 19:28.250
I think it would be best
that it's your mom, for everyone's sake.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.420
Okay, guys.
I'm sorry to break up all the fun.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.964
I have to stop by work.
That's what the boxes are for.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.633
Seymour, Seymour,
you need to go to the bathroom?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.594
Kenny's leaving,
so now is the time.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.012
Not now.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.097
- Why don't you just try?
- No.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.016
You sure
you don't have to make?

19:44.099 --> 19:45.994
I thought Norman gave you
the rest of the week off?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.604
Oh, he did. I just...
I'm gonna go by for a minute,

19:48.687 --> 19:51.124
and then I'm gonna pick your brother's
family up at the airport.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.151
Okay, well, if you take the minivan,
don't adjust the seat setting.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.196
- Don't adjust it?
- No, I got it set perfect. Please!

20:06.246 --> 20:08.624
Oh! Hey, hey, big man.
What's in the boxes?

20:08.707 --> 20:10.459
Oh, these? These are for him.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.628
Hi. Okay, okay.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.296
How're we doing? How're we doing?

20:14.379 --> 20:18.091
Everybody, everybody,
this is my almost dad-in-law, Kenny.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.468
Look at this.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.304
I am so happy you made it.
Congratulations.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.349
You got quite a cousin here
or whatever he is to you.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.934
Nice to meet you.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.436
I hope everybody likes the hotel.
It's a Two Diamond.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.775
So, yeah, my company worked on it
and it's fantastic.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.628
If you have any problems,
you make sure and call me.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.154
I left an emergency contact number
in every room.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.407
Hey, no problem.
Psyched to be in New York City.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.535
Capital of the world, y'all!

20:45.619 --> 20:47.162
Actually, we're in Long Island,

20:47.246 --> 20:50.123
which is an hour and 20 from the city.
Three hours with traffic.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.336
Probably not gonna have time for that,
but next time you come, for sure.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.296
- Yeah.
- Your father, is he here?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.799
No, he's actually coming in tomorrow.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.342
You know, work, work, work, right?

21:00.425 --> 21:02.195
All right.
Looking forward to meeting the man.

21:02.219 --> 21:08.016
Uh, room service is open till ten o'clock.
So enjoy that, guys. Great to meet you!

21:08.100 --> 21:12.104
I played Linus and Sarah was Lucy.
That was tenth grade.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.023
I remember that show. You were very good.
Wasn't he, Sarah?

21:15.107 --> 21:18.652
They would rehearse right in her bedroom,
for hours on end!

21:18.735 --> 21:20.362
Is that all you did?

21:20.445 --> 21:25.826
Stop it, Iris. Please.
It's ancient history, just like he said.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.327
Oh, yeah, definitely.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.580
Jesus Christ, he is so pathetic.
I can't stand him.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.500
He just won't leave.
His parents aren't even here now.

21:33.583 --> 21:36.003
Do you want me to bang him?
'Cause I would totally bang him

21:36.086 --> 21:38.255
if it would help just get him away
for a while.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.673
It's okay.

21:39.756 --> 21:40.882
Think about it.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.236
Okay, so we have to decide what song
you're gonna come out to, okay?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.261
I know.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.722
It's like, we gotta do choreography,
we have to...

21:46.805 --> 21:48.765
Oh, my God!

21:50.892 --> 21:53.812
Um, my number four premolar
is a little sensitive to cold.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.565
- Can you help me?
- I'm so happy you're here.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.443
Of course. Are you calm?
Have you been reading Bad Feminist?

21:59.526 --> 22:02.321
Yes, thank you, and I feel like
a better bad feminist for it.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.698
Hi, I'm Robin.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.075
- Oh, hi.
- My BFF.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.036
This is Emily and Danielle from school.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.788
- Hi, we've heard so much about you.
- Yes. So many stories.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.750
It's so nice to meet you two.
It's good you're here.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.561
This one could really use
some love right now.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.128
Oh, no.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.714
It's nothing,
especially with you guys here early.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.720
- You are so tall in those shoes.
- Aw.

22:26.803 --> 22:30.515
Guys, I've seen her in her dress already.
She is gorgeous

22:30.599 --> 22:32.893
and she was just
so worried to me about it.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.186
Aw, I can't wait to see it.

22:34.269 --> 22:37.105
Oh, so we were talking
about the reception

22:37.230 --> 22:39.511
and what song we should come out to
when we're introduced.

22:39.566 --> 22:42.069
Oh, like one of those corny YouTube thing?

22:42.152 --> 22:44.529
- It'll be fun.
- Right?

22:44.613 --> 22:50.243
Um, so, our friend Kelly suggested
"Party Rock," LMFAO.

22:50.327 --> 22:53.622
- Oh, that's lively.
- But I suggested Journey.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.624
You know, "Don't Stop Believin'"?

22:55.707 --> 22:58.168
My God, that is perfect.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.920
See?

23:00.003 --> 23:02.798
It's so obvious and so amazingly overdone.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.383
Yeah, that would be hilarious.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.928
That's a good one, Robin.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.031
Showing us that he can play center field.

23:10.055 --> 23:10.889
He's showing that.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.950
I think he's doing
a pretty good job there.

23:12.974 --> 23:13.993
He's okay out there.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.895
And obviously, I mean,
he's starting to hit again.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.984
Mmm. I can't believe
she's getting married.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.379
I remember when you used to drive her
around on her paper route

23:25.403 --> 23:27.572
'cause she was afraid to ride her bike
in the street.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.657
Yeah.

23:28.740 --> 23:32.327
Jeddy is so excited to DJ the wedding.
Aren't you, Jeddy?

23:32.410 --> 23:35.205
I hear you're quite the DJ, young man.

23:35.288 --> 23:38.291
They said he had to do it.
So you could save money.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.335
Come on, Noah. No, he doesn't mean that.

23:40.418 --> 23:41.795
Yes, he does.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.840
Oh, listen. You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.550
He wants to do it.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.261
I don't! Not at some stupid wedding!

23:49.344 --> 23:51.471
Noah! You see what you did?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.182
Thanks for having Noah.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.726
It's so nice
they let him out of rehab for the week.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.354
Oh, yeah. Gotta have Noah. Love the boy.

24:00.147 --> 24:03.525
Yeah. They said he can stay at your house
with special instructions.

24:04.609 --> 24:08.488
Wait, you're staying with us?
I mean, 'cause that's phenomenal.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.865
I told you that.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.367
I know you did. I know you did.

24:12.450 --> 24:16.246
I'm gonna call home, make sure
that everything is perfect for you.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.790
How're we supposed to have them here?
Please, fill me in.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.711
Yeah, so they'll stay
in Isaac's room. Right?

24:22.794 --> 24:26.214
And Isaac will move to Rose's room.
That's great.

24:26.298 --> 24:31.595
Yeah, but Noah? How did this happen?
Did Jay tell you and you forgot about it?

24:32.470 --> 24:35.724
Yes, yes. It's gonna be great.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.851
I gotta go.

24:40.520 --> 24:44.107
Right. Of course. Yeah, sure, sure.

24:44.816 --> 24:49.571
Ah, not as excited as these guys are, huh?

24:50.113 --> 24:53.200
Yeah, no, we'll be home soon.
The traffic's not so bad.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.701
I love...

24:56.494 --> 25:01.625
What is the, uh... What's happening?
The... Is she still...

25:02.292 --> 25:04.586
That's weird. Let me...

25:05.712 --> 25:07.964
Ah, honey? Are you still there?

25:08.048 --> 25:10.342
Uh, yeah. Hello?

25:10.425 --> 25:11.551
Who's this?

25:11.635 --> 25:14.012
This is Marvin.
I'm a cousin of the groom.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.640
You said to call
if there was any problems.

25:19.267 --> 25:22.437
Yeah, it's pretty much since we got here.
Now it's worse.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.105
We get it fixed very soon.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.024
Oh, why not now, pal?

25:26.107 --> 25:31.613
There is some work being done
in Executive Suite directly above.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.448
- That's my dad's room?
- Yes.

25:34.824 --> 25:38.495
It's possibly possible
this work may have caused the leak.

25:39.996 --> 25:41.539
The cutting into the ceiling.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.792
Yeah, well, I'm not aware of this work.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.504
But maybe if you guys used
the inch-and-a-half copper pipes,

25:47.587 --> 25:50.799
like we suggested four years ago,
we wouldn't be in this jam right now.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.926
Can't we just get another room
in the meantime?

25:54.302 --> 25:57.472
Why the giggling?
Is the rest of the place booked?

25:57.555 --> 26:00.100
Well, I know there's
a Ronnie the Limo Driver book signing

26:00.183 --> 26:02.245
tomorrow night in the lobby,
so the place is buzzing.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.979
That's interesting.

26:04.062 --> 26:09.025
So, uh... I can apologize to you for this.
I really am truly embarrassed.

26:09.109 --> 26:13.697
But maybe I can call some other hotels,
check on their availability.

26:13.780 --> 26:18.493
Or if we need to, you guys could crash
at our house until it's fixed.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.577
That'll work.

26:21.496 --> 26:25.583
Okay. So, we'll do that.
Hey, don't forget your gift bags.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.422
My wife and kids
put them together for you.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.884
Snapple.

26:34.968 --> 26:38.513
All local foods.
Snapple's based on Long Island.

26:39.055 --> 26:42.142
That's from the King Kullen Supermarkets,
also Long Island.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.353
Cool. Thanks.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.401
This is so nice, right? This is great.

26:51.484 --> 26:54.404
Everybody all cozy together in one place.
I love it.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.990
Yeah, and with Noah.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.575
Oh, yeah.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.493
I think this is gonna be good for him.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.038
We just have to follow
the center's instructions.

27:03.121 --> 27:06.207
Oh, sure. What can we do for you?

27:06.291 --> 27:08.877
So, obviously, no one should drink
in front of him.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.047
Oh, okay. Sure, we can make that work.

27:12.130 --> 27:15.675
Another guest with special requirements,
that's fine.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.886
No knives near him.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.180
Oh, even in the kitchen?

27:20.263 --> 27:23.433
Well, I think they mean hide them.
Not anywhere he can get to them.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.352
- Okay.
- No cords.

27:25.435 --> 27:29.230
Jay? What else? We're talking about Noah.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.234
- Did you mention the medicine cabinet?
- Oh, yeah.

27:33.318 --> 27:37.489
You should remove any medication,
pills of any kind from your cabinets.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.742
- And triggers.
- Yes, triggers. No music.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.827
No music at all?

27:42.911 --> 27:45.288
I only ask 'cause we're having a wedding.

27:45.955 --> 27:49.042
Not sure. You know what?
I have the list of triggers on my iPad.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.585
Do you have a printer?

27:57.008 --> 28:00.095
Oh! Kenny, Kenny, Kenny,
let my cousin help you out with that.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.389
- He's the one sleeping on it.
- She's feeding me.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.015
No, it's fine. We're having fun.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.601
- You gotta put it in the hole, honey.
- I'm trying, Dad.

28:06.684 --> 28:09.479
I know you're trying. You're doing great,
but it's better if it's in.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.231
Hey Tyler, wanna have a catch?

28:11.314 --> 28:14.859
Hey, sorry, little man. I gotta run.
But I'll be back later on tonight. Okay?

28:14.943 --> 28:16.986
- You gotta leave already?
- Yeah, I gotta take off.

28:17.070 --> 28:21.533
- She doesn't want him to leave.
- Of course she doesn't. She loves him.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.993
Yeah, you know I gotta go study.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.745
- He has to study.
- Yeah.

28:26.663 --> 28:30.041
- When are you coming back?
- She wants to know when he's coming back.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.754
Now they want privacy.

28:36.172 --> 28:37.966
Hi. I'm Sarah, by the way.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.468
Sarah. Right. Nice to meet you.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.221
I'm the groom.
Which side of the family are you on?

28:43.304 --> 28:45.974
- I've lost track.
- Me, too. Me, too. Yeah.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.285
Do you wanna go somewhere else,
like, a little bit quieter?

28:48.309 --> 28:51.205
I don't know, like Mardi Gras
or a Justin Bieber concert or something?

28:51.229 --> 28:55.775
Guess what? My dad's concerned about
the open bar. Said the deal's a rip-off.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.545
Yeah, it's all good.
It's whatever he wants.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.946
At this point,
I just wanna look good in the pictures.

29:00.029 --> 29:02.115
Oh! I didn't see anything!

29:02.824 --> 29:04.826
There's nothing to see, brother.
Thanks. Good luck.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.619
It must be that new love shit, huh?

29:06.703 --> 29:08.955
- What?
- Okay, time to go.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.375
Okay. Happy studying. Love you.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.128
She loves him. Like I said before.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.714
Course she does! That's her guy.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.216
Pinky Toe!

29:21.885 --> 29:24.554
- Oh! Oh! Okay.
- Sorry, man.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.139
Should we keep her outside?

29:26.222 --> 29:30.101
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.
We'll find a way to separate them.

29:33.396 --> 29:38.401
Yeah, I'm calling to get your flight
information so I can, uh, pick you up.

29:38.485 --> 29:39.485
When are you coming?

29:39.527 --> 29:42.155
Hey, look, man.
I had to get on an earlier flight.

29:42.238 --> 29:45.283
They were forecasting
bad weather out in LA.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.451
So you're here?

29:46.534 --> 29:48.369
Because we can get you the room.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.914
Sorry, I can't hear shit.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.124
You got an animal shelter
going on, or what?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.960
Let me find a quiet place. Hang on.

29:57.295 --> 30:02.967
I said we could get you the room tonight,
or you could stay with us.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.512
No, no, I didn't wanna put you guys out.

30:05.595 --> 30:06.763
I feel bad.

30:06.846 --> 30:10.016
I shouldn't have called so late.
Did I wake you up?

30:10.099 --> 30:14.062
No, no, no, I'm up reading surgery books.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.689
So you're in the city.
What hotel are you at?

30:16.773 --> 30:18.316
The Mandarin.

30:18.399 --> 30:22.821
Ooh! Well, you are going to love the room
we got you here.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.156
It is spectacular.

30:25.240 --> 30:29.077
I'll pick you up
in the morning.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.079
I can get a car service, man.

30:31.162 --> 30:34.791
No. Absolutely not.
I will see you at ten o' clock.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.001
I'm sorry, just one more second.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.047
Hi! I heard you're just
reading a book.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.067
I hope it's okay if I ask you
one more little question.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.652
We were told to clear out
our medicine cabinet...

30:44.676 --> 30:45.844
Oh, shit.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.971
...for a house guest
who just got out of rehab,

30:48.054 --> 30:51.391
and what I'm wondering is,
does that include anti-frizz shampoo?

30:51.474 --> 30:53.434
Because I saw there's alcohol
on the label.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.758
I don't wanna take any chances.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.605
But it's a brand-new bottle, right?
I mean, it smells pretty good.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.566
I don't want anyone drinking it over ice.

31:01.317 --> 31:03.486
Oh, my God,
it smells good in here.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.781
All right, I'm off.
I'm off to pick up the big man.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.325
- He's not a big man.
- Okay.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.536
Why don't you let him get a car service?

31:11.619 --> 31:14.414
- He's the one with the money.
- Okay, Iris.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.628
Oh! Hey, guys. What's doing? Come on in.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.965
- What's that?
- Oh, breakfast is cooking.

31:24.048 --> 31:28.094
I'm sorry, I didn't get
everybody's name yesterday. You're...

31:28.177 --> 31:29.929
- Leonard.
- Leonard. That's right.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.306
- Jermaine.
- Jermaine is it.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.557
That's it. There you go.

31:32.640 --> 31:36.352
Yeah. We got the killer eggs going,
and pancakes and, uh...

31:36.436 --> 31:38.897
I was on my way to pick up Dr. C, but...

31:38.980 --> 31:43.401
Hey, uh, guys, look who's here.
It's Leonard and Jermaine.

31:43.484 --> 31:46.154
I found them outside.
This is my brother, Mark.

31:46.237 --> 31:49.908
And this is Rose, my daughter,
and Iris and my wife, Debbie.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.367
Bringing it with the home fries.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.912
What do you like, pancakes, eggs?

31:53.995 --> 31:55.663
Uh, sure.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.349
- Okay. Okay, let's go.
- Well, there's your answer.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.043
All right. And this is Noah,
over there in the corner.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.378
That's fake crystal, by the way, Noah.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.589
And where's Sarah?
Where is the bride?

32:04.672 --> 32:07.216
She is sleeping, I'm guessing,
or stretching her shoes.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.969
Hey, Marvin, Ethridge, look who's here.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.096
Hey.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.766
"Hey"? That's all they get?
For Leonard and Jermaine?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.209
You can't give them a little more?

32:17.018 --> 32:20.229
Um, how you doing? Nice to meet you.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.274
"Nice to..."
These are your family, right?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.109
- I don't know them.
- Me, neither.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.319
Not my family.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.572
Okay.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.535
- We were just walking by...
- Yeah. I get it.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.498
Go ahead and, uh...
enjoy the breakfast anyways.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.459
My mistake.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.840
Oh, good morning.
You sleep okay in Rose's room?

32:47.924 --> 32:49.842
Yeah. It was great.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.761
I like those glasses, Iris.

32:51.844 --> 32:56.975
Mark gave me a free eye exam at his store,
and then he got me these glasses cheap.

32:57.058 --> 33:00.520
Well, you got the wholesale price.
You paid what I would pay.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.064
Well, that sounds like a nice deal.
I'm in.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.440
Family discount.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.526
Wow, that's so nice. Thank you, Mark.

33:06.609 --> 33:08.027
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.738
- You hear about Mark's deal?
- That's the hookup.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.615
It's a bargain, you guys.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.868
Wait, I'm so bad with names.
Which cousin are you again?

33:15.952 --> 33:18.454
- Uh, actually we're...
- Just roll with it.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.374
- Cousin Leonard.
- Cousin Jermaine.

33:21.916 --> 33:23.501
Welcome.

33:23.584 --> 33:24.584
Thank you.

33:31.217 --> 33:34.012
Columbus Circle.
I'm going the right way, right?

33:34.095 --> 33:35.805
Keep it going. Yep.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.640
It's a Two Diamond.

33:37.724 --> 33:40.601
I mean, nothing against the place
you were staying, but...

33:47.567 --> 33:49.336
...runs, I mean,
it's not like this team hasn't hit.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.653
Because they have hit.

33:50.737 --> 33:54.490
Housing market. Yuki Noguchi, NPR news.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.367
Hey. There he is!

33:56.451 --> 34:00.288
I... I'd get out of the car,
but that truck driver's honking at me.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.831
No problem.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.308
Sir, could you pop the trunk, please?

34:03.332 --> 34:06.085
Oh, uh, this is jammed. Uh...

34:06.169 --> 34:07.771
Do you want me to put 'em
in the back seat?

34:07.795 --> 34:10.297
- No, take the key. Take the key, please.
- Take the key. Okay.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.716
Take the key. Just pop it.

34:11.799 --> 34:14.886
- Be one sec. He's gonna, he's...
- Sir, there's no keyhole back here.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.447
Okay. Let me have the key back, then.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.014
Just put the stuff in the back seat.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.536
- Back seat, you got it.
- Thank you.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.438
Got you a Starbucks. Worth it, right?

34:26.438 --> 34:30.025
Thanks, thanks,
but I may need to stay sleepy.

34:30.109 --> 34:34.362
Oh. Okay. Stayed up all night
with the surgery books?

34:35.614 --> 34:38.534
Yeah, and the electric blinds
programmed wrong.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.079
Oh. Well, this car,

34:41.161 --> 34:43.681
ah, the seats recline all the way back
if you just pull the handle.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.248
I can do it for you if you want.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.751
No, I'm... I'm good.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.212
Got seat heaters, too.

34:49.295 --> 34:52.172
Just press the button.
But it's summertime, so...

34:52.255 --> 34:54.007
Yeah, my seat... My seat's fine.

34:54.634 --> 34:59.097
Well, we should be there in 45 minutes
to an hour, thirty, so...

34:59.180 --> 35:02.517
Think about reclining it.
It's there for you if you want it.

35:03.184 --> 35:08.439
And also I would crank up the AC,
you just gimme a nod.

35:10.691 --> 35:14.153
- That was a nod. Okay.
- That was an AC nod.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.572
Oh, it was the AC nod.
I thought you were nod...

35:16.656 --> 35:18.467
All right, let's see
how the window goes for a bit,

35:18.491 --> 35:20.118
and then we'll get the AC going.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.000
How we doin' with the AC? You good still?
You don't need it, right?

35:29.168 --> 35:31.504
I'm just talking gas-wise,
it's better off.

35:31.587 --> 35:34.257
I'm just saying, AC would be great.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.843
You say it and we... We'll turn it on.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.887
I said it.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.057
That's right. 100%.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.811
I'll just hit the switch
and it's blasting.

35:49.438 --> 35:51.232
It's really hot in here.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.650
It's getting there, right?

35:53.526 --> 35:54.902
All right, go to sleep.

35:56.070 --> 35:58.990
It's hard to sleep
'cause of all the noise.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.200
- Yeah. All right.
- From outside.

36:01.951 --> 36:05.037
How's this? Let me turn it on for you.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.831
- Better?
- Yeah.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.791
- Okay, let's turn it off.
- Then...

36:11.836 --> 36:13.379
This is Dr. Cortice.

36:13.462 --> 36:15.423
Yes, all ready.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.883
Uh-huh. The suite?

36:18.801 --> 36:22.138
There he is! You almost gave me
a heart attack. Mr. Last Minute, huh?

36:23.014 --> 36:23.890
What, you forgot?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.576
We're supposed to have a meeting
about Saturday.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.435
This guy you married.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.353
I'm gonna bring this man up to his room.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.771
Hi, Dr. Cortice.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.232
Oh, stop with the "Doctor."
Just call me Kirby.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.526
Look, just don't call him "Dad"
or Kenny will plotz.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.321
- That's not true. That's not true.
- You look gorgeous.

36:38.404 --> 36:41.365
I've seen her in the dress.
You're gonna have a seizure.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.552
You know what?
You guys do what you gotta do.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.661
I'm gonna hit the room.
And I'll catch you later.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.264
Oh, no. I'm gonna bring you
up to the room.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.707
Oh, come on, Pop. He's a big boy. Come on.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.070
Hanan, you're gonna bring him...

36:51.125 --> 36:53.395
We gotta talk down the running order.
And where's the magician?

36:53.419 --> 36:54.420
We have a magician?

36:54.503 --> 36:57.381
Yes, we do, honey.
He's great. He goes table to table.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.926
He's gonna double as the emcee, too.
He does it all.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.595
Kenny, did you ever ask Sarah
if she's good with the magician?

37:02.678 --> 37:04.680
What? Now she doesn't like magicians?

37:04.764 --> 37:08.059
- Ah, here's Kent!
- Apologies, folks. Is this the bride?

37:08.142 --> 37:10.144
- Yes.
- Ah, pleasure.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.564
I'm gonna have a heart attack!

37:13.648 --> 37:15.107
You see what I mean, huh?

37:15.191 --> 37:16.651
Kent, take 'em through the night.

37:16.734 --> 37:19.362
Cocktails. I'll be going around
with the light stuff:

37:19.445 --> 37:21.322
cards, coins, foam balls.
Keep it simple.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.033
Wait. Magic during the cocktails?

37:24.116 --> 37:25.996
Well, you want people to stay
interested, right?

37:26.077 --> 37:27.888
- What, you think they're gonna be bored?
- I don't know.

37:27.912 --> 37:31.082
It's a fast-moving world out there.
You got computers, cellular telephones...

37:31.165 --> 37:32.833
May I continue?

37:32.917 --> 37:33.918
Yes.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.212
Wedding, photos, reception line,

37:36.295 --> 37:38.297
"Folks, if you'll find your way
to your tables,"

37:38.381 --> 37:39.257
crowd-work,

37:39.340 --> 37:40.675
"Is this your card, madam?"

37:40.758 --> 37:44.720
Boom, cheers,
"Who's the next victim?" Laughs,

37:45.346 --> 37:48.641
"Oh, I see you've forgotten this,"
pulls card from pocket,

37:48.724 --> 37:50.142
screams,

37:50.226 --> 37:53.938
"Sir, I see you really love your queens."

37:54.021 --> 37:55.106
Big laughs.

37:55.189 --> 37:58.067
"And now for the real stars of our show,"

37:58.150 --> 37:59.902
- cue band.
- DJ.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.112
- Cue DJ.
- Yes.

38:01.195 --> 38:03.447
Introduction, bridesmaids, groomsmen.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.074
We're gonna come out in pairs.

38:05.157 --> 38:06.575
And who's this?

38:06.659 --> 38:09.328
"This" is the bride's best friend.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.915
We choreographed an entrance.
It's gonna be to "Don't Stop Believin'."

38:12.999 --> 38:15.084
- That sounds amazing.
- Right?

38:15.167 --> 38:17.687
- So obvious, you gotta love it.
- Yes. High camp.

38:17.753 --> 38:20.673
- You know what'd be hysterical?
- I know what you're thinking, Glen.

38:20.756 --> 38:22.591
- Dry ice.
- Yes.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.095
He knows his stuff.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.437
What the...

38:36.689 --> 38:38.482
TV, color.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.610
Refrigerator is here.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.237
Mmm-hmm.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.866
Toaster. Four slice.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.165
For exercise.

38:54.957 --> 38:56.375
Or to hang myself.

38:56.459 --> 39:00.838
Is there anything else I can get for you?

39:00.921 --> 39:03.549
You know what? I'm gonna go to bed.
Long night.

39:47.968 --> 39:50.596
So, all you did was just pull on the cord?

39:50.679 --> 39:53.974
I didn't pull on anything.
I didn't touch it. I breathed on it.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.309
That's interesting,

39:55.393 --> 39:59.939
because I remember when we suggested
the reinforced ceilings,

40:00.022 --> 40:01.440
you didn't wanna go for that.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.275
No.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.821
And why does the hotel have a painting
of your grandma hanging up?

40:06.904 --> 40:10.324
Oh. That's not my grandma.
That painting came with the room.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.201
But she looks just like you.

40:12.284 --> 40:13.452
Does she?

40:13.536 --> 40:16.622
I take that as a compliment 'cause
that's a very attractive woman there.

40:16.705 --> 40:18.290
But it's not my grandma.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.836
So, what does Rose call you?
What are you to her?

40:21.919 --> 40:23.421
Sister's father-in-law?

40:23.504 --> 40:25.357
Well, that's what he is,
that's not what you call him.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.259
- Who folded the chair?
- Oh! It was blocking the path.

40:28.342 --> 40:31.178
Well, did you know
that his hands are insured?

40:31.262 --> 40:32.763
He's very important.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.033
I mean, honestly, you don't have to move
the old man for me.

40:35.057 --> 40:38.686
Oh, no, no, no. He's happy wherever he is.
Don't worry about that, pal.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.021
Dr. C needin' his own space.

40:42.022 --> 40:44.483
Hey, Pop. Uh...

40:45.359 --> 40:46.735
You flew into New York yesterday?

40:46.819 --> 40:48.112
Yeah, it was a weather thing.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.531
A weather thing in LA?

40:50.614 --> 40:54.994
Hey, I'm here.
I took my room at the Shits Carlton.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.788
Got a chandelier to the skull,
just like I requested.

40:57.872 --> 41:01.584
So, any celebrities you've worked on?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.169
- You mean, like, surgery?
- Yes.

41:03.252 --> 41:06.297
Yeah, I can't really speak
about the ones that aren't public.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.882
But you know Rosie O'Donnell?

41:07.965 --> 41:10.843
Oh, my... Debbie! Rosie McDonald!

41:10.926 --> 41:12.970
- What? What?
- He did the heart.

41:13.053 --> 41:15.973
Was she nice? She doesn't seem happy.

41:16.056 --> 41:18.476
Well, she was asleep most of the time
I was with her.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.311
Oh! Well, you see, that's rude.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.188
Ma, he means the anesthesia.

41:23.689 --> 41:24.857
Of course!

41:26.775 --> 41:30.279
Are you sure you wanna be part
of this crazy family?

41:30.362 --> 41:31.362
No.

41:32.364 --> 41:36.243
Sorry, guys. Remember, the loud laughing,
it's a trigger.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.211
Are we really not gonna talk
about this now?

41:45.294 --> 41:47.755
No, Dad,
I'm not gonna have a prenup.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.382
She's a nice girl. But...

41:53.802 --> 41:55.095
She's a nice girl,

41:55.179 --> 41:58.182
but come on, look around,
these people are broke.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.143
Oh, uh, one second.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.522
- Hey, Kenny.
- Yeah?

42:04.605 --> 42:06.357
Kenny. Real quick.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.737
- Oh. All right! Small problem.
- Yeah?

42:11.820 --> 42:14.782
I'll fix it. Just...
I'll shoot over to the hotel.

42:14.865 --> 42:15.884
- Okay.
- I'll go with ya.

42:15.908 --> 42:18.702
No, no, no! You hang out here! You relax!

42:18.786 --> 42:22.498
It definitely burns.
Yes. It's killing me.

42:23.123 --> 42:26.544
Ask him. I mean, he's not a urologist,
but I'm sure he'd take a look.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.128
I'm going with you.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.590
Okay, gotta run over to the hotel.
Be back in a few.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.008
Seymour, do you need to go?

42:33.634 --> 42:35.177
Seymour, Kenny's leaving.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.304
Seymour, can you wake up?

42:40.307 --> 42:41.350
Why did he...

42:41.433 --> 42:43.245
You're gonna need a valet
to move these cars.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.854
No, we'll take my wife's minivan.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.649
You drive with your seat
that close to the wheel?

42:48.732 --> 42:51.986
Yeah, it's good. This way I'm closer
to the button. It's...

42:52.069 --> 42:54.321
Yeah, but you go full leg
in the other car.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.823
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.075
Uh, whose room are we goin' to?

42:58.158 --> 43:01.996
- Uh, your daughter's room. And...
- My ex mother-in-law.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.914
- Seymour's up!
- Come on.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.584
- Incredible. All right.
- Seymour's up!

43:06.667 --> 43:08.877
- Goodbye. Goodbye, already.
- He has to go!

43:08.961 --> 43:11.422
Hey, he has to go!

43:12.381 --> 43:15.050
So, it's... The leak's just spreading now.

43:15.843 --> 43:20.556
This is because of the doctor's suite
the workers had to fix.

43:20.639 --> 43:23.309
- Okay.
- Oh! It's all about the doctor now?

43:23.392 --> 43:26.312
Same doctor that found the tumor
on your CAT scan.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.772
Stage two. Big-ass deal.

43:28.856 --> 43:31.400
Beat it, dumped on it, moved on.

43:32.151 --> 43:34.111
Uh, and the hotel's completely booked?

43:34.194 --> 43:35.946
It is squishy.

43:36.030 --> 43:39.533
Oh, yeah! You heard the squishy noise.
And it made you laugh more.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.327
You know, I can get you guys a lifeguard

43:41.410 --> 43:43.579
or move you into a nicer place
till they fix this.

43:43.662 --> 43:44.663
- No!
- No!

43:44.747 --> 43:46.540
We don't need your nice place, Dad.

43:46.624 --> 43:50.044
I'm not gonna be separated
from the family. I value family.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.127
Okay, okay.

43:52.171 --> 43:53.380
I hear the squish.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.264
There's plenty of families staying
at our house, including your father.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.468
You're welcome to join us.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.428
Thank you. That sounds fine.

43:59.511 --> 44:04.516
These sweaters I'd laid out got leaked on.
I expect to be compensated.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.685
Oh. We'll work on that. Ah...

44:06.769 --> 44:09.396
Until then, there's something else
I can do for you ladies.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.535
Parcheesi?

44:23.619 --> 44:25.263
You never heard of
Parcheesi, Marvin?

44:25.287 --> 44:26.872
It's more fun than it looks!

44:26.955 --> 44:30.876
It's from an old Indian game.
The Parcheesi tribe, I think.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.670
Is that right, Ma?
I never heard that one.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.421
'Cause that's not true. At all.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.632
Okay, Mr. Know-It-All.
Look it up.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.915
Yeah, he won't look it up,
'cause he knows you're right.

44:40.636 --> 44:42.805
Dad, where do we put these?

44:42.888 --> 44:44.908
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Everyone, look at this.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.035
My kids are actually helping
for the first time in their lives.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.895
- Oh, stop it.
- Congratulations.

44:49.978 --> 44:52.731
Take it to the office,
where Dr. Cortice was gonna sleep.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.274
Okay, yeah. You take those there.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.127
- Is that where we're gonna be tonight?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:56.151 --> 44:58.821
Dr. Cortice, you can take our bedroom.
I never sleep anyway.

44:58.904 --> 45:02.241
No, she'll vacuum all night long.
You'll hear that.

45:02.324 --> 45:04.444
- Hey, how come...
- It's my guilty pleasure.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.133
How come nobody sleeps down here, though?

45:06.161 --> 45:09.373
It's nice, the game room, right?
It's just the asbestos.

45:09.456 --> 45:11.667
It's fine for a couple of hours,
but not a whole night.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.169
- What?
- No, it's good in moderation.

45:14.253 --> 45:15.879
In moderation it's fine.

45:15.963 --> 45:19.258
Okay, so, Kelly and me were thinking,
"What has never been done before?"

45:19.341 --> 45:21.218
And then it hits us, boom.

45:21.301 --> 45:24.304
We come out and do
a whole evolution of dance thing.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.098
Right, like, we start with the disco

45:26.181 --> 45:29.560
and then we go all the way to the Whip
and the Nae Nae.

45:29.643 --> 45:32.104
Isn't this supposed to be,
like, 20 seconds?

45:32.187 --> 45:35.065
Okay, please don't be jealous,
this is Sarah's time.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.235
So, we come out
in our John Travolta jackets and...

45:42.114 --> 45:43.407
What happened to your face?

45:43.490 --> 45:45.200
Oh, my God, is that an allergy?

45:46.410 --> 45:47.453
What're you doing?

45:48.245 --> 45:50.205
Ah, I'm coming over.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.709
Me and Iris have to finish our game
of gin rummy. We're tied.

45:54.460 --> 45:55.794
Fun.

45:55.878 --> 45:59.673
Well, we were just about to hit up
the Noodle Bar in Syosset,

45:59.756 --> 46:03.385
sit outside the bathroom and rate the guys
as they come out.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.180
Or I saw online,
there's this stretching class.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.307
- Oh, yes!
- So, Sarah needs to decompress

46:08.390 --> 46:10.225
and it is RumChata shot night, okay?

46:10.309 --> 46:12.328
Kelly, get the bags.
Is this your going-out clothes?

46:12.352 --> 46:13.479
I only have three shirts.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.939
- I like that one.
- Yeah, thank you.

46:16.023 --> 46:18.942
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve!

46:20.986 --> 46:22.571
You have another move.

46:22.654 --> 46:24.114
- Fourteen.
- What now?

46:24.198 --> 46:28.285
Well, it says in the rules,
if you roll a doublet,

46:28.368 --> 46:31.205
you get to move
what's on the other side of the dice.

46:31.288 --> 46:33.874
- A doublet?
- I never played that way. Opposites?

46:33.957 --> 46:36.502
We're good. Thanks anyway, Doublet.

46:36.585 --> 46:37.585
Doublet.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.129
Doublet.

46:39.213 --> 46:42.257
Morgan!
Get to business, Morgan! Come on!

46:52.434 --> 46:54.561
- Hello?
- Hey, what's up, girl?

46:55.312 --> 46:57.981
"Girl"? What do you want, Kirby?

46:58.065 --> 47:02.528
Well, you know, I figured
since we're in the same city and all,

47:02.611 --> 47:03.796
you know, maybe I could come over and...

47:03.820 --> 47:06.573
We're in the same city all the time. LA.

47:06.657 --> 47:10.202
Yeah, but our baby's getting married.

47:10.285 --> 47:12.996
You know? That baby we made together?

47:13.080 --> 47:14.080
Mmm-mmm.

47:14.122 --> 47:17.793
I'm here with Ignacio.
I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.

47:17.876 --> 47:21.088
Well, you know, I just thought maybe
you might wanna hang out

47:21.171 --> 47:23.423
with a grown-up for a change.
That's all.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.509
Are you really trying to booty call me

47:25.592 --> 47:28.512
just so that you could get out of
that house with all your relatives?

47:29.096 --> 47:31.014
Booty call? Why would you even go there?

47:31.098 --> 47:34.059
You think I don't talk
to my mother? Doublet.

47:34.142 --> 47:38.647
Doublet? That's the rules!
Those are the actual rules of the game!

47:38.730 --> 47:43.110
I got all the grown-up I need
right here.

47:43.193 --> 47:44.778
Thank you.

47:46.655 --> 47:47.698
What's up, man?

47:48.448 --> 47:51.618
- I'm all right.
- Fucking Lakers.

47:52.202 --> 47:53.202
Yeah.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.499
Uh-huh. We'll see you Friday.

48:12.389 --> 48:14.742
I'm in control,
I'm in control. I'm in control.

48:14.766 --> 48:17.352
I'm a good person. I'm a good person.
I have dreams.

48:17.436 --> 48:18.562
I have aspirations.

48:18.645 --> 48:22.858
I have things that are going on in my head
whether anyone believes it or not. Okay?

48:22.941 --> 48:24.276
You don't know me.

48:26.612 --> 48:27.613
So, what's up?

48:29.114 --> 48:30.574
Don't pretend you wanna talk.

48:34.244 --> 48:35.996
You can write prescriptions, right?

48:36.997 --> 48:39.875
I am not going to jail for you.

48:40.459 --> 48:43.045
Look, I don't wanna freak you out.

48:43.128 --> 48:46.757
But there is a significant chance
that I will burn this house down

48:46.840 --> 48:49.301
if I'm not on drugs
within the next two hours.

48:49.384 --> 48:52.220
Oh, if my ex-wife is in here
when you burn it down,

48:52.304 --> 48:54.014
I'll give you all the pills you want.

49:18.830 --> 49:20.540
Ah, so sexy.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.293
Work it. Uh-huh!

49:25.128 --> 49:28.131
Damn. Look at those!

49:31.176 --> 49:33.095
Whoo!

49:34.012 --> 49:38.100
Feel good. These are firm, girl!

49:38.892 --> 49:41.520
I wonder if they taste
as good as they feel.

49:42.562 --> 49:44.856
Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah.

49:46.024 --> 49:47.693
Ooh, I'ma get all up in there.

49:55.575 --> 49:57.220
What's the matter?

49:57.244 --> 49:58.704
- Is there a burglar?
- No!

49:58.787 --> 50:00.307
Don't worry, I got the bat! Take this.

50:01.331 --> 50:03.208
My hands! My hands!

50:03.291 --> 50:04.686
Are these the ones that are insured?

50:04.710 --> 50:08.130
Yeah! They're my hands!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

50:08.213 --> 50:09.881
- What the shit?
- There you go!

50:09.965 --> 50:12.384
It's honey. It's the best thing
to soothe the pain.

50:12.467 --> 50:15.429
There you go.
Just leave that on for ten minutes.

50:15.512 --> 50:16.763
Ah! Ah!

50:35.031 --> 50:37.993
Are you here yet? He's outta clothes.

50:38.076 --> 50:40.287
Well, I didn't want him to overpack.

50:40.370 --> 50:41.973
You guys can't wash what he has?

50:41.997 --> 50:44.458
Charles, we have a wedding
this week! It's...

50:44.541 --> 50:48.086
All he's got left
is his old, moldy army uniform.

50:48.170 --> 50:51.047
Well, it fits him again
since the diabetes.

50:51.131 --> 50:52.549
He likes it.

50:52.632 --> 50:57.846
Wasn't he, like, discharged for skipping
boot camp during Passover or something?

50:57.929 --> 51:02.601
Hey, he served his time. He did, like,
11 months in Texas or somewhere.

51:03.101 --> 51:06.646
Anyway, you're getting him a tux, no?
He doesn't have a tux.

51:06.730 --> 51:07.981
You understand that, right?

51:08.064 --> 51:09.065
Yes, yes.

51:09.149 --> 51:12.819
Just come here, please, and get the booze
like you said you would.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.197
Don't worry. I'm getting a deal, here.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.657
Haitian guy I met on the plane
is setting me up.

51:17.741 --> 51:18.968
Okay, great. Thank you.

51:18.992 --> 51:21.828
Yes, you got the arm.
Right there, Seymour.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.164
You okay, Seymour?

51:24.289 --> 51:26.583
- Brake. Brake.
- Brake?

51:26.666 --> 51:29.169
Brake. Brake. Yeah.

51:32.589 --> 51:35.258
Dominic, Lazzero,
I'm gonna need another tux.

51:35.342 --> 51:38.553
I didn't realize my uncle Seymour
doesn't have one.

51:38.637 --> 51:40.388
Wow, look at this man.

51:40.472 --> 51:42.349
Thank you for your service.

51:42.432 --> 51:43.266
It's okay.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.644
You kidding me? You didn't tell me, Kenny.

51:45.727 --> 51:47.354
What? No, no, he's not...

51:47.437 --> 51:50.232
We're gonna take good care of you.
You're not gonna spend a dime.

51:50.315 --> 51:52.609
We don't get heroes here very much.

51:52.692 --> 51:53.693
World War II, right?

51:53.777 --> 51:54.820
Yep.

51:54.903 --> 51:55.946
No one here's paying.

51:56.029 --> 51:58.949
I got your whole family, Seymour.
Bless you.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.827
Greatest goddamn
generation right over here.

52:01.910 --> 52:04.746
You got that right.
Freakin' legs blown off.

52:06.456 --> 52:09.876
Did he just say nobody's paying
for anything?

52:09.960 --> 52:12.379
Yeah, what'd you say to them?

52:12.462 --> 52:15.215
I didn't lie. He was in World War II.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.551
Here you go, Uncle Seymour.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.011
I got arms. Just hand me the chicken.

52:20.095 --> 52:21.555
I wanna say this.

52:21.638 --> 52:24.641
Last week, we had
Ronnie the Limo Driver in here.

52:24.724 --> 52:27.310
This is bigger. This means more.

52:29.396 --> 52:31.356
Ah! Look at this guy. Huh?

52:31.940 --> 52:33.191
Lookin' sharp, kiddo.

52:33.275 --> 52:34.275
Dad?

52:34.860 --> 52:37.696
How do you like it, Isaac? Is it okay?

52:38.196 --> 52:39.489
Is it itchy?

52:39.573 --> 52:42.284
Don't worry. If it's itchy,
we'll find you another one.

52:42.367 --> 52:44.828
- That's a nice tux.
- But the kid isn't happy.

52:45.829 --> 52:49.124
You are happy? No? Why are you upset?

52:50.250 --> 52:52.919
Isaac, come on. We don't got time.
We gotta move...

52:53.003 --> 52:55.964
The game! Oh, shit! Sorry!

52:56.047 --> 52:57.507
Guys, guys, we gotta go!

52:57.591 --> 52:59.426
The kid's got a game.

52:59.509 --> 53:01.094
We're gonna watch you, Isaac.

53:01.177 --> 53:02.846
We're all gonna watch Isaac.

53:08.101 --> 53:09.978
Isaac, go big!

53:10.061 --> 53:11.271
Let's go, Isaac!

53:11.354 --> 53:13.523
How do you not know
where the field is, Ma?

53:13.607 --> 53:16.151
You've been coming for six years already.

53:16.234 --> 53:18.987
Just turn on the GPS, then.

53:19.070 --> 53:21.907
What do you mean,
the lady's voice frightens you?

53:21.990 --> 53:23.950
Turn the volume down, then.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.870
I don't know what to tell you, Ma.
This is...

53:26.953 --> 53:29.706
I can't hear you.

53:30.957 --> 53:32.542
Stay calm, Ma.

53:33.126 --> 53:35.420
What? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

53:35.503 --> 53:39.007
- Thank you for your service.
- What a hero. World War II, right?

53:39.090 --> 53:40.508
Yep.

53:40.592 --> 53:41.968
What do you say, Eva?

53:42.052 --> 53:44.429
- Thanks for killing the Nazis.
- Good girl.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.848
Yeah, yeah. Thank...

53:48.767 --> 53:51.519
- Him? Yeah, yeah, sure.
- A real hero!

53:52.771 --> 53:55.231
They do know his legs
are from diabetes, right?

53:55.315 --> 53:58.068
Ah... Never came up.

53:58.151 --> 53:59.295
Ladies and gentlemen,

53:59.319 --> 54:04.157
to throw out the first pitch,
World War II veteran, Seymour Lustig.

54:06.618 --> 54:09.329
He was in World War II. In Texas.

54:09.412 --> 54:10.830
Our hero!

54:21.299 --> 54:22.717
All right, let's go.

54:22.801 --> 54:25.261
Everybody's a winner!
Everybody's a winner!

54:25.845 --> 54:27.764
Every day's the World Series.

54:29.975 --> 54:33.395
- Where's Isaac?
- I guess he's not starting.

54:33.478 --> 54:34.354
Boo!

54:34.437 --> 54:35.939
Boo!

54:39.275 --> 54:41.736
He'll get in the game, guys!

54:41.820 --> 54:44.447
- Put Isaac in!
- That's gobbledygook!

54:50.078 --> 54:51.913
Run, Bobby! Run!

54:53.540 --> 54:54.540
You suck!

54:54.582 --> 54:55.792
Put Isaac in!

54:55.875 --> 54:57.669
Okay, you can't...

54:57.752 --> 55:00.171
Please don't discourage Noah.
He needs the release.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.799
- Get that shitty kid out of there!
- Yeah!

55:02.882 --> 55:04.884
Send that little bitch home!

55:04.968 --> 55:07.637
Isaac! Isaac!

55:07.721 --> 55:10.348
Isaac! Isaac!

55:10.432 --> 55:12.308
- Isaac! Issac!
- Who's Isaac?

55:12.392 --> 55:14.561
I think it's the war hero's grandkid.

55:14.644 --> 55:17.439
Oh. Isaac! Isaac!

55:17.522 --> 55:19.149
Isaac!

55:19.232 --> 55:21.109
Isaac! Isaac!

55:21.192 --> 55:23.695
Isaac! Isaac! Isaac!

55:24.487 --> 55:29.075
All right, Isaac, you're gonna bat for Max
when he comes up next inning.

55:30.118 --> 55:31.661
Your name's Isaac?

55:37.375 --> 55:39.878
Isaac! Isaac!

55:48.178 --> 55:52.724
He's upset. He's upset.
He's upset. He's upset.

55:53.349 --> 55:54.349
Okay.

55:55.060 --> 55:56.728
Listen, it's just a game, Isaac.

55:56.811 --> 55:58.354
Don't worry about it.

55:59.981 --> 56:02.650
Whatever happens, everyone loves you.

56:04.819 --> 56:05.737
Strike one.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.113
Boo!

56:07.781 --> 56:10.241
That was low!
Are you outta your mind, Eddie?

56:10.325 --> 56:13.119
Thanks for the wedding invite, Ken.
I've only known you 15 years.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.997
Are you kidding me? Am I supposed to
invite the whole town?

56:18.500 --> 56:19.584
Strike two.

56:22.670 --> 56:24.899
That's all right. That's all right.
Keep your eye on the ball.

56:24.923 --> 56:26.341
Just make contact, buddy.

56:26.424 --> 56:27.424
Just make contact.

56:27.467 --> 56:30.470
We'll get ice cream after
no matter what, okay?

56:33.932 --> 56:35.058
Go! Go!

56:35.141 --> 56:37.393
I got it! I got it!

56:43.274 --> 56:44.275
Yes!

56:45.443 --> 56:47.362
Yeah! Yeah, buddy, yeah!

56:48.196 --> 56:49.197
Matt, you okay?

56:50.073 --> 56:51.616
Hang on a second, buddy.

56:51.699 --> 56:53.701
Isaac! Isaac!

56:53.785 --> 56:55.578
Thank you for your service.

56:55.662 --> 56:57.205
Isaac! Isaac!

56:57.288 --> 56:58.915
Isaac! Isaac!

56:58.998 --> 57:02.168
Isaac! Issac! Issac!

57:02.252 --> 57:04.879
Isaac! Isaac! Isaac!

57:04.963 --> 57:07.715
Isaac! Isaac! Isaac!

57:07.799 --> 57:09.551
Damn!
I missed the game, huh?

57:09.634 --> 57:11.469
I heard a kid got hurt.

57:12.053 --> 57:13.930
- Charles?
- Hey, Pops, don't get up.

57:14.013 --> 57:15.765
He loves those jokes.

57:16.349 --> 57:19.060
Hey, glad you got here.
What's with the bags?

57:19.644 --> 57:22.647
It's the booze for the wedding.
All duty-free, baby.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.608
What is that? Chivas?

57:25.692 --> 57:28.194
Yeah, and not a dime in taxes.

57:28.278 --> 57:30.196
They say this should feed about 200.

57:30.780 --> 57:33.634
Dad, I'm sorry. I know you're doing
everything you can, and I love you, but...

57:33.658 --> 57:35.994
Mr. Lustig, I can't let this happen.

57:36.744 --> 57:38.204
What the...

57:38.288 --> 57:39.539
Why is that one open?

57:39.622 --> 57:41.749
Come on, it was a two-hour Uber ride
from the airport.

57:46.045 --> 57:47.672
In case anybody wants some smokes.

57:48.256 --> 57:49.591
And...

57:50.425 --> 57:52.594
this bad boy is gonna light up
the dessert table.

57:53.178 --> 57:54.179
You ate some.

57:54.762 --> 57:57.932
I ate, like, one-fiftieth.
Geez. You're welcome.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.393
- Dad!
- Listen...

58:00.894 --> 58:04.022
I will speak to the caterer.
We'll figure it out right away.

58:04.105 --> 58:05.106
I promise you.

58:05.690 --> 58:07.817
See, this is what happens
when you try to cut corners.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.861
You can't have bottles like this.

58:09.986 --> 58:12.280
That's cheesy. Extra cheese, man.

58:12.363 --> 58:13.239
Okay.

58:13.323 --> 58:14.365
- Dear.
- Yes.

58:14.449 --> 58:17.911
We don't mind pitching in
for some regular bottles. Honestly.

58:17.994 --> 58:19.621
No, no. No, Mom, it's okay.

58:19.704 --> 58:23.958
Mr. Lustig just wanted to make sure
there was enough booze for Robin, so...

58:24.042 --> 58:27.670
Look, I can get you decanters so you
don't have to look at these bottles.

58:27.754 --> 58:29.506
That's actually a smart idea.

58:29.589 --> 58:31.341
I mean, it's up to you guys, but...

58:32.467 --> 58:34.511
- Okay, that could work.
- Yeah?

58:34.594 --> 58:36.721
I mean... That's wonderful. I...

58:36.804 --> 58:38.324
- We should start getting ready.
- Kenny!

58:38.348 --> 58:39.909
- We got parties...
- Why's your hair wet?

58:39.933 --> 58:41.684
- My hair's wet?
- Yeah. Why's it all wet?

58:42.352 --> 58:43.686
What the hell is...

58:45.855 --> 58:48.733
- Why is this happening, pal?
- This room priority, yes?

58:48.816 --> 58:53.112
I know. I know. But why's the rest
of the hotel going to shit?

58:53.196 --> 58:54.322
Sir?

58:54.405 --> 58:57.283
They were supposed to shut off
the water to the whole line of rooms,

58:57.367 --> 58:58.493
and didn't until now.

58:58.576 --> 59:02.288
Oh, okay. Why would somebody
forget to do that?

59:03.665 --> 59:05.708
What the hell is so funny?

59:06.209 --> 59:08.711
Nobody else is laughing.

59:08.795 --> 59:10.755
Why are you laughing?

59:10.838 --> 59:12.215
These sheets!

59:12.298 --> 59:14.926
The honey! The stupid honey!

59:15.009 --> 59:16.820
- How'd you sleep?
- It's like...

59:16.844 --> 59:21.140
This damn honey's everywhere, man!
I'm trying to get this honey off!

59:21.224 --> 59:24.143
You look good, buddy.

59:25.436 --> 59:26.729
How come I got no water?

59:26.813 --> 59:28.314
Turn the water on. Turn...

59:28.398 --> 59:30.751
- But if water...
- I need some water to wash this...

59:30.775 --> 59:31.859
Turn the water on!

59:31.943 --> 59:33.987
- Turn it on!
- ...off my werewolf hands!

59:34.070 --> 59:35.506
- Go. On, please.
- Water! Help me!

59:35.530 --> 59:37.949
Somebody help me! Please!

59:39.284 --> 59:40.910
- It's boiling!
- Cold water.

59:40.994 --> 59:42.912
- It's boiling hot!
- Cold water too.

59:42.996 --> 59:45.164
What're you people
trying to do to my hands?

59:45.248 --> 59:47.709
Ah... Oh, thank you.

59:47.792 --> 59:49.294
- Okay.
- Praise God!

59:49.377 --> 59:51.796
- What're you doing?
- What's going on?

59:52.338 --> 59:54.578
- Turn the water back on!
- Why's it off?

59:55.133 --> 59:57.010
What? What now?

59:57.093 --> 01:00:00.597
- The water...
- It can only be on a minute, or...

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.181
Or? Or what?

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.814
You know what?

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.858
That's it. We did your thing.

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.776
Your 99-cent wedding,

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.655
and the booze bottles for giants,
and the spoonin' with Uncle Stumpy.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:20.700
Let me bail us outta this, okay?

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:24.120
I'm gonna get my assistant.
She's gonna make some calls.

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:27.665
And we're gonna move
the wedding to Manhattan.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.835
You don't have to, pal. We're all set.
I can make this work.

01:00:30.918 --> 01:00:33.755
Buddy. Pal. It's not a competition.

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:35.965
- You don't have to feel bad.
- I don't.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:39.427
I don't feel bad
because I know I can fix it.

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:44.599
Listen.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:49.896
Every father looks forward
to making a wedding for their little girl.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.105
You understand?

01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:55.526
I have been able to help my kids
their entire lives.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.654
I'll be able to figure this one out.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:04.869
Honey, maybe the thing to figure out is
to let Kirby pay for the wedding.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.080
Some of it?

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.666
Maybe we don't have money

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.627
because you spend it all
on the Home Shopping crap!

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:15.505
That bottle keeps my coffee hot
for 12 hours!

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:19.258
- What do you save coffee for?
- Because I'm not a wasteful person!

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.220
- Are they gonna get a divorce?
- They never do.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:24.013
Talk to Marci Schiller at the W.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.723
And you know what else?

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:29.435
Check out The Plaza,
and see if they have a cancellation.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:30.561
Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:34.190
No, there's gotta be a decent hotel
I can book a ballroom in.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.943
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:38.903
Saving the day with money.

01:01:38.986 --> 01:01:40.196
Oh. Okay.

01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:44.951
Maybe you wanna skip the rehearsal dinner
that I paid for with my money,

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.036
with the mini mac and cheese cups

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.580
and the pulled pork dumplings.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.083
That's right. East meets South.

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:57.213
You know, I got a little potato salad
from Sylvia's coming in.

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.048
Maybe you want some of that.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:02.677
Or you wanna just sit here
and eat the white people potato salad?

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.513
I've never seen you
do anything with...

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:06.472
Yeah, thought so.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.682
Now get.

01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:11.602
You're gonna kill me.
I was wrong about honey.

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:12.788
It was supposed to be mayonnaise.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.856
- Good news is, I got some Bactine.
- Hey, hey!

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:15.982
Just let it soak in.

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.526
- You're spraying the phone.
- It relieves pain on contact.

01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:19.712
What's up with the ballroom?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:23.072
Oh, I thought we talked about this, pal.
You don't gotta do what you're doing.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:25.783
I can handle it. Don't book anything.
Listen to me.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:28.995
- Think of it as...
- You gotta trust me. Gotta trust me.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.664
- Hang the phone up. It's the truth.
- It's just a backup.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.124
- I... I can handle it.
- Okay.

01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:34.751
- I can handle it.
- Watch the hands.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:37.879
I don't wanna hurt the hands.
Let go of it. Let go.

01:02:38.629 --> 01:02:40.691
Hello? Dr. Cortice, I got The Plaza.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:43.926
No, that's all good.
We can cancel that.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.553
- Sorry? Cancel it?
- Okay.

01:02:45.636 --> 01:02:47.472
Thanks for all your help.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.348
Sorry, pal. Had to.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.558
I don't sound like that.

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:52.852
I... You do a little.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.979
- All right. All right.
- Who?

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:56.248
What're you doing?
Who you talking to?

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:59.525
Some guy from the mayor's office.
He wants to see Seymour.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.235
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:03.946
Seymour. Seymour, wake up.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.507
Hey, bud, wake up.

01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:07.784
Hi. Hi. Hi, how are you?

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:08.868
Come on.

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:11.704
Yeah, there.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.124
Seymour! You gotta wake up!

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.585
They want us there at three o'clock.

01:03:17.668 --> 01:03:20.171
Okay, how's this?
If you act nice,

01:03:20.254 --> 01:03:22.131
we'll take you to the bachelor party.

01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:24.884
Yeah! Yeah!

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:32.387
There he is.

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:35.770
It's an honor, sir.

01:03:37.104 --> 01:03:39.607
- Tits.
- Thank you.

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:41.442
And you're...

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.986
A friend.
I just came to get out of the house.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.780
Okay, great. If you'll follow me.

01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:48.503
We just need to go into the next room,
where you'll meet the mayor.

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.171
Welcome, Private.

01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:03.589
How you doing there?

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.426
All right, come with me.

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:13.099
It is a real honor to have

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:16.435
this Long Island-born heroic veteran
from World War II,

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.396
Private Seymour Lustig,

01:04:18.896 --> 01:04:23.651
back here in West Hempstead, Long Island,
to be honored at City Hall.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.488
And we hope you'll be back
many more times, Private.

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.949
Now I'll be happy to answer
any of your questions.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.635
Mr. Mayor,
are you gonna have your office

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:35.955
release your ledgers and payroll records,
as required by the Board of Supervisors?

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.583
Please. We have a war hero here,
all right?

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:41.961
- No time for these types of questions.
- If you have nothing to hide...

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:46.048
You know, I am really disappointed
in you guys bringing up this garbage

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.009
when we're honoring a great man.

01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:53.014
The mayor has been great
to Private Lustig.

01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:57.935
He's even honoring him
this weekend, as well.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.732
- Yeah, we're gonna have a little...
- Yeah, we're having a dinner.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:03.815
We're having a dinner.

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:06.986
Incredibly generous of the mayor.

01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:13.284
Um... Listen. I've always been
a great supporter of our military.

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:15.369
- This was...
- Right here.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.038
Saturday night.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:23.127
Uh, Uncle Seymour is just so overwhelmed
by the mayor's kindness. It's...

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.842
That means he's touched.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:35.723
I hope that was okay, Mr. Mayor.

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:40.561
I... I just saw the wolves moving in.
I figured I had to say something.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.480
Well, I appreciate it.

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:45.775
You don't have to do any
of that stuff I was mentioning.

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.443
No, no, it's a good idea.

01:05:47.526 --> 01:05:50.446
I mean, you said it,
so I gotta do it, right?

01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:53.115
We are having a party
for Uncle Seymour

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.951
on Saturday night already, so...

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.329
That's fine. You'll have it here.
How many people you expecting?

01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:02.291
Oh... About... 180.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.375
Hmm.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.754
That's fine. Uh...

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.467
I just fired a teacher.
I have a little wiggle room in the budget.

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:13.594
Uh, we'll get some photographers
and have a party.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.055
I mean, look at that. Look at that.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.146
Okay.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.149
Yeah.

01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:33.531
No need for photographers.
No need for food.

01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:35.324
We get it all included.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:36.742
So, we don't need a magician?

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.495
No! I mean, I still think
that would've been good,

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:40.746
but no, you don't need that.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.249
- God! I'm so relieved!
- Good, all right.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.876
I mean, I knew you'd come through, Dad.
I did.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.629
- I love you. I love you.
- When do we get going?

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:51.132
What time's the bachelor party?

01:06:51.215 --> 01:06:54.135
Oh! You coming
to the bachelor party, Seymour?

01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:56.846
Kenny, darling,
why don't you take Isaac with you?

01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:59.932
Take him to the bachelor...
Because he's 11 years old, Ma.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.309
Just so things don't get too crazy.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.477
Where am I going?

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.771
I actually... I'm not sure
how to get there.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.523
I printed the directions.

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:10.109
Oh. Thank you.

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:12.611
Seymour. Seymour's got it.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:22.954
Hey.

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.207
Hey! What's going on, fellas?

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:26.834
Isaac's here?

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.335
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:31.047
Couldn't let my son be happy
for one more day?

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:32.715
What's up, Dad?

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:34.759
Hey, Dr. Cortice,
how are you?

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:36.594
- Kenny.
- Hi. Hi.

01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:40.181
How're you doing, fellas? Look at you.

01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:42.266
That was very creative, fellas.

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:45.686
- Whose idea was...
- Tyler, when do we get to jump?

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:49.482
- We don't jump.
- We just watch.

01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:07.083
Noah, is the music bothering you?

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:10.252
Why don't you listen
to that ocean waves sound on your iPod?

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:13.130
I said I shouldn't be here.
This is not fun for me.

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:15.466
Yes, and people said, "Don't come."

01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:18.176
- I don't wanna be that guy who can't come!
- Oh, boy.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.888
He's right on the edge. No triggers.

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:25.184
Guy? Can you shut off the music, please?

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.560
Yeah, now. Shut it off.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.859
It's okay. You can keep dancing.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.468
These gummies are hilarious.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:02.805
I know. It's really hard to find ones
with little gummy scrotes! Oh, wait.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:05.224
Morgan, have you tried the Dickorice yet?

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.725
I'm already in the middle
of this Jell-O shot.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.645
Oh. You're gonna love it.
It has a very accurate aftertaste.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.022
Okay, Sarah?

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:13.232
My sweet princess.

01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:16.694
No!

01:09:16.777 --> 01:09:17.903
Oh, yes!

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.904
Robin, this is so...

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:22.198
Corny?

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.953
Oh, is that funny to you, huh?

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.667
Guys, I think she's drunk.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.587
And she's had one drink.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.214
Danielle never drinks.

01:09:37.798 --> 01:09:39.175
Are you okay, cutie?

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:43.804
Maybe she just needs to calm herself down,
'cause we've got a lot to get through.

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:46.223
We haven't even gotten to
the tipstick yet.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.941
It was the right thing to send Noah home.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.318
For his safety.

01:09:57.401 --> 01:10:00.404
The Uber came in four minutes.
It was meant to be.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:04.700
Whoo!

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:06.243
Ignacio!

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:13.292
Hey, ladies, who wants
some of this triple bypass money?

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.979
- Come on. Let's do it now.
- Okay.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.003
Oh!

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.423
- Yeah!
- That is not cool.

01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:21.133
- Not cool at all.
- Yeah!

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:24.553
World War II!
World War Two!

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.264
World War II! World War II!

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.600
Drink! Drink!

01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:31.685
- Drink!
- Yeah!

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.607
I love you, man!

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:39.151
Seriously! Thank you for your service!

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.070
I wanna go there!

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:44.031
He wants the titties.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:46.367
Yeah!

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:48.077
One!

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.120
Two!

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.413
Incoming!

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:01.840
Seymour?

01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:07.137
Seymour?

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:08.973
Where is he?

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.724
Everybody, get over here!

01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:13.769
Get over here! Jump in! Come on!

01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:16.230
Hey, Marvin, dig right there. Dig there.

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:19.024
You two over there.
Come on. Hurry. Hurry.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.026
There's a man with no legs down there.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.027
Come on, Tyler.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.964
- Kenny, we need your help. Jump in.
- I'll call you back.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:26.216
We can't find Seymour.
He's in there somewhere.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.426
What do you mean, he's in there?
Who let him in?

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.953
Where is he? Where is he?

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:32.347
I think I feel something.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:34.873
- There! There he is!
- Seymour.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.625
Pull it! Pull it off!

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:37.769
He can barely breathe!

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:38.937
- All right!
- We gotta get him out!

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.671
Dr. Cortice! Where are you?

01:11:41.755 --> 01:11:43.007
What's going on?

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.552
Something happen?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.178
All right. Before we go...

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:51.098
Does he have any preexisting condition
we need to know about?

01:11:51.598 --> 01:11:53.392
What would you need to know about?

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:56.562
Well, we need to know what medications
he's taking or can't take.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.939
Does he have a preexisting condition?

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.112
He...

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:07.656
Diabetes.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:12.119
- Oh, okay. So, the legs...
- Ah...

01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:13.954
That shit's not from the war?

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:16.498
That old fool lost his legs to sugar?

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:22.129
That's cheating!

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.592
You guys, stay in here.

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:30.304
It's probably the neighbors
about the penis-whistling.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:35.434
What're you doing here?
Is the bachelor party over?

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:40.272
Yeah. Someone had a stroke
and the strippers got mad. Where's Sarah?

01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:42.524
You listen to me.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:46.695
You are to go nowhere near my best friend.
That is history.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.824
Oh, my God, it's a stripper!

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:51.908
I'm sorry?

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:53.660
She's a little out of it.

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:54.953
You're an adult.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.207
You should've learned how to drink
eight years ago, when you were 15.

01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:00.084
Hey, do you want to have sex?

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:02.628
I mean, go back to your place?

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.922
I mean, do you?

01:13:05.005 --> 01:13:06.673
- Wait. Is that Jared?
- Yep.

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:09.009
Got him off your back for you.

01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:13.972
Uh, maybe we should hold off.

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:16.266
Because you're drunk,

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:20.062
not because my dad's waiting for me
in the car out front to take me home.

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:27.778
So, how's he reacting to the cortisone?

01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:30.072
His vitals are stable right now,

01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:33.158
but between his age,
the stress of being under foam,

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.577
and, of course, the diabetes...

01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:39.081
it doesn't look promising.

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:41.083
His face looks very red.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:44.837
My understanding, from the EMTs, is that
the redness is from the punch bowl.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.047
That's all fruit punch?

01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:49.174
Yes. I tasted it.

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.135
Guys, I'm so sorry.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.262
- I feel responsible.
- Stop this right now.

01:13:53.345 --> 01:13:54.697
This was gonna happen to this man,

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:57.975
whether he was thrown
into a foam pit with strippers

01:13:58.058 --> 01:14:00.436
or home alone, watching Wheel of Fortune.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:03.188
He had a preexisting condition.
It had nothing to do with you.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.273
All right.

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:06.358
- All right?
- Yeah. Thanks, Kenny.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.734
Thanks, man.

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:09.403
Charles.

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:14.032
I think you should have
some time alone with Seymour.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.618
I've been alone with him for years.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:20.664
Yes, but you might wanna
share with him right now.

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:22.875
It's healthy for both of you.

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.251
Closure.

01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:26.920
You don't wanna leave anything unsaid.

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:28.422
Really?

01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:31.133
Don't hold back now.
You'll regret it.

01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:33.760
Leave nothing unsaid.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:42.227
I'm sorry. Very.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.449
I used to whack off
into our vacuum cleaner...

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.452
thinking about Magdalena, our housekeeper.

01:14:59.786 --> 01:15:01.371
And then Mom...

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:04.917
replaced the vacuum
with one of those Dysons

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.668
that doesn't have a hose.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.215
And I felt lost.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:24.102
But fortunately, I figured out,
one time after breakfast,

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:30.275
that if you fill a Ziploc bag
full of Bisquick and warm water,

01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:32.486
and then make a tube...

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.947
He's been in there for an hour.

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:37.574
I guess he's got a lot on his mind.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.288
Thank you.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.628
Whatever happens,
I feel like a weight's been lifted.

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.631
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:05.227
Here is a man who taught us
that you can walk with God,

01:16:06.019 --> 01:16:07.729
even without legs.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:12.651
The navi Shmuel,
in the eponymous Book of Samuel,

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.779
tells the painful story of Mephibosheth,

01:16:15.862 --> 01:16:19.241
the son of Jonathan,
the grandson of King Saul,

01:16:19.324 --> 01:16:22.578
a man who was loyal to King David
through thick and thin.

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:27.583
Mephibosheth, the prophet tells us,
was lame,

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.168
and lived at the mercy
of those around him.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:34.548
- He was manipulated, mocked...
- What's with the strip?

01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:35.966
That a Jewish thing?

01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:40.887
I use it to keep me from snoring.
I don't wanna be rude.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.016
Seymour Lustig was loyal
through and through.

01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:08.498
The time I was able to spend
with Private Seymour Lustig was brief.

01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:12.628
But the lessons I learned
will last a lifetime.

01:17:13.545 --> 01:17:16.590
Private Lustig was not
a man of many words,

01:17:16.673 --> 01:17:19.301
but he did tell me
that he loved West Hempstead,

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:22.846
and even said that I had done a great job.

01:17:23.555 --> 01:17:25.098
You did great up there.

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:26.183
- Ah, thanks.
- Yeah.

01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:27.100
Sorry about your loss.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.811
Thank you. I guess I'll see you
tomorrow night.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:32.022
No, no, no. That's not happening.

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:33.106
What's that?

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.901
Why would we have a tribute dinner
if he's not gonna be there?

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:40.405
Well, I figured a nice
kinda posthumous kinda thing.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.949
The funeral was a posthumous
kind of thing, no?

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:46.578
Yeah, but I thought
you already promised us the dinner, so...

01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:50.165
I know about the diabetes, okay?

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:52.292
All right?

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.960
I think we're done here.

01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:55.962
Now, let's put him in the hearse.

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:04.054
- Oh. Got to keep it level, man.
- Morons.

01:18:17.734 --> 01:18:20.070
Hey. How's everybody doing?

01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:21.154
Good, Dad.

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:24.324
Right. Let's get in the car. Come on.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:27.994
You didn't have your guys
fix the ballroom leak yet?

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:31.998
Well, we're back on, so get 'em on it.

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:33.458
Please stop giggling.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.793
Kenny, are you ready?

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.795
Come on! The rehearsal dinner's at 8:00!

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.297
I know! I'm going downstairs already!

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.133
- Do his tie!
- All right!

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.384
Wow, Dad!

01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:44.344
What? What happened?

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:46.763
I think I've seen you
in a suit three times:

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:49.015
my bat mitzvah, my high school graduation,

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:51.476
and when you took us to the city
to see Phantom.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.602
Yeah.

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:55.814
All three times
I wore this suit, by the way.

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:57.357
It still looks great.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.656
You're making it all happen, Dad.

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:08.326
- Yeah.
- Dad! Dad!

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.537
I think I did my tie good.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.497
Yeah. Hey, it looks fantastic.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.417
- It's... Let me just touch it up.
- Okay.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.169
Okay. You knotted it up good.

01:19:17.794 --> 01:19:19.129
Wow, Dr. Cortice.

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:20.338
So handsome.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.591
- Everyone's so excited for tonight.
- Come on.

01:19:22.674 --> 01:19:25.427
It's not City Hall,
but we'll have some fun.

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.179
Okay, okay.

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:29.931
- Over here.
- Okay.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.475
Hey, what's wrong?

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.727
Hey. Nothing, pally.

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:37.355
You look like you found out
Sears went out of business.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.274
No, no, no.

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:42.652
Did tomorrow blow up?

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:47.949
Yeah. Yeah, but it's okay.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.244
So, your family's good with it?

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:54.748
I can't... I haven't had
the heart to tell them.

01:19:55.248 --> 01:19:58.502
Look, why don't you just
let me pay for City Hall,

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.003
and nobody has to find out.

01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:03.048
Yeah. Please don't ask again.

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.508
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:06.218
- You'll figure it out.
- Thank you.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:09.304
Tonight, it's just immediate family.
It's not that big a deal.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:11.431
Thanks.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:16.228
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:19.022
I'll say hi to the driver.
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:22.818
Wait, wait.
Which one's the driver?

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:25.379
I figured if they had to drive themselves,
they might get lost.

01:20:25.403 --> 01:20:29.074
Yeah, the Hamptons are hard to find.
That makes sense.

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:30.700
You got two of 'em, huh?

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:32.661
Yeah, they gave me two
for the price of two.

01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:35.580
That's funny. That's funny.

01:20:45.131 --> 01:20:46.842
Dad, this place is like a dream.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:50.637
Oh, yeah. It's very understated,
just like Sarah's taste.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.306
They've got croissants in a jar and...

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:56.059
This place is amazing. Who lives here?

01:20:56.142 --> 01:20:58.854
Thank you. It's a well-known celebrity.

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:01.648
Do you know Psy?
He recorded that song "Gangnam Style."

01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:03.316
You know Psy?

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.569
Well, actually, I did his father's heart.

01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:07.279
He lends his art to museums.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.948
Of course he does. Amazing.

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:12.409
Psy has beautiful taste, doesn't he, Mom?

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:17.289
Oh. Oh, yeah, wonderful taste. Mmm-hmm.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:21.001
You know, when you bite your thumb,
you're supposed to stop.

01:21:29.342 --> 01:21:30.594
How's school?

01:21:31.177 --> 01:21:34.097
Dad, I took a year off to travel abroad.

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.891
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I knew that.

01:21:38.935 --> 01:21:40.270
Did you try the pork dumplings?

01:21:40.353 --> 01:21:41.813
They're so good.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:46.401
No, because I'm a vegetarian.
I've been a vegetarian for two years.

01:21:46.484 --> 01:21:48.528
Oh, I thought that was slang
for something.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.906
No, Dad, I'm not a lesbian.
I keep telling you.

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:52.991
You're not?

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.160
Hello, everybody.

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:59.164
This has been such a gratifying night,
to see all of you

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:01.416
- enjoying yourselves so much...
- Thank you.

01:22:01.499 --> 01:22:03.001
...after all our planning.

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:04.084
And to Sarah,

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:06.838
we can't wait to have you in our family.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:07.964
Thank you.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:10.675
I can't wait to spoil my first grandchild.

01:22:12.677 --> 01:22:16.890
May I add here that we are especially
excited for a Jewish grandchild.

01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:19.768
As you know, Drake is black and Jewish,

01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:22.687
and he's our favorite artist
to make love to.

01:22:23.563 --> 01:22:24.397
Okay.

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.024
Okay, Kirby.

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.943
Speech from the father!

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:29.626
Oh! didn't know I was supposed to speak.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:31.488
I'll do one if he doesn't.

01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:33.156
No, no, that's okay, kid.

01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:36.242
Uh... Well, what can I say?

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:39.579
First, I wanna salute my ex-wife, Katrina.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:43.541
It's a great speech,
and her boyfriend, Pistachio.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.712
So, we're here to talk about my son,

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.631
who, uh... You know...

01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:53.802
I wasn't there when he was born,
but I was on my way.

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:58.181
And when I got there,
I was excited to meet him.

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:02.060
I never hit my children.

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:06.356
That's one of the good things
about not being there.

01:23:07.023 --> 01:23:09.067
I never beat their mother.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:13.822
She beat me a couple of times.
We called the cops.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:18.702
You know what? Let's forget 2008, okay?

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:20.870
Not even gonna bring it up now.

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:28.044
Should've let me go.

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:01.494
What the hell are you doing?

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:05.373
Check it out.
I snuck some video at the bachelor party.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.417
You're looking at strippers?

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.461
Your father just died today.

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:11.671
Hey, it's after midnight, okay?
That was yesterday.

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:12.755
Well...

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:16.092
Listen, I need your help. I...

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.762
The mayor backed outta the City Hall.

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:19.971
Politicians.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.824
You know they're lying
'cause their lips are moving.

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:25.143
- I still haven't told anybody yet.
- Well, don't.

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.519
Here's what you say.

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:29.898
The mayor said something racist to you,
and you had to pull the plug.

01:24:29.981 --> 01:24:31.107
People love that.

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:32.067
How?

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:35.445
How do you even prove that?

01:24:35.528 --> 01:24:37.322
Fine. How about bats?

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.656
What?

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.384
You know, you say you can't
do the wedding there

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:42.118
because there's bats in City Hall.

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:43.620
You know, an infestation.

01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:45.246
There's bats all around!

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.058
They're in the underpass
at the train station.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.667
All we need is nets. All right?
We get them into City Hall,

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.628
and they have to close it down. Done.

01:24:51.711 --> 01:24:53.272
- What are we getting in City Hall?
- Bats.

01:24:53.296 --> 01:24:54.672
No... Stop it!

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:57.592
- What are you doing up?
- I'm always up. Bats?

01:24:57.675 --> 01:24:59.803
No, I don't know what he's talking about.

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:05.767
Okay, listen.
The mayor killed the wedding.

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:07.936
Just... Just 'cause of the lying?

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:12.273
I don't know how to tell anybody.
I'm sick to my stomach right now.

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:15.110
So we have to sabotage City Hall!

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:19.781
Fireplace. Remember? There's a fireplace
in the mayor's office.

01:25:19.864 --> 01:25:23.243
We just get bats down the chimney,
and we're in. That's it.

01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:25.326
Come on. There's only a few hours
left of darkness.

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:29.040
What? You and me are gonna go catch
a bunch of bats?

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.417
And me. I'll help.

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:34.629
Yeah, but they are fast.
We'll need a bunch of people.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.069
Are you sure we don't need
the other guys for this?

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:01.114
Ah, it's only two floors.
I can scale it myself.

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:03.032
One...

01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:04.742
two...

01:26:05.785 --> 01:26:07.203
three!

01:26:08.204 --> 01:26:09.473
Oh!

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:12.542
Oh, oh, oh! They're freaking out.

01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:15.253
- Ah, come on!
- Calm down.

01:26:16.045 --> 01:26:17.172
Give me the Kahlua.

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:18.173
The what?

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:20.383
It's still in the trunk. Come on. Hurry.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.015
You all right?

01:26:27.098 --> 01:26:29.809
- Just hold it steady.
- Careful, careful.

01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:31.745
- Hold... Hold my...
- I got it!

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:33.146
All right, bag!

01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:35.940
Bag! Bag! Give it to him!
Get it! Go!

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.358
- All right.
- Go.

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:38.985
Go! Yes!

01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:40.546
- Good, good.
- Yes!

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:41.905
Go, go.

01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:44.490
Okay.

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:46.284
Oh!

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.661
Ah!

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:11.434
What're you doing?

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.314
Gotta give it a minute.

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.233
The bats need to know that
they can't fly out.

01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:24.405
All right, I think we're good.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:27.784
What the heck?

01:27:27.867 --> 01:27:29.577
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.582
- Get your clothes!
- I got it!

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:35.833
Clear!

01:27:36.834 --> 01:27:37.835
Let's go.

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:40.213
Call 911.

01:27:40.296 --> 01:27:43.424
Go! No 911! Can't do that. Let's just go.

01:27:56.312 --> 01:27:57.814
All right, done!

01:27:59.148 --> 01:28:02.860
Might wanna throw away that bag, though.
Those morons pooped in it.

01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:11.369
Police and animal control are working
to remove several dozen bats

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:15.581
that authorities say were discovered this
morning inside West Hempstead City Hall.

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:19.210
What the hell?
Kenny, what are we gonna do?

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:20.962
I don't know. That was crazy.

01:28:21.045 --> 01:28:24.007
You can get all kinds of rabies
from those assholes.

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:26.009
Are people even gonna wanna
go in there now?

01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:29.178
Honey, I'm sure if you want it there,
most people will go,

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:31.097
if... If we're allowed.

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:33.474
- Right?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.643
Well, don't put this
all on yourself, sweetheart.

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:38.563
Come on, everybody. Come in here.
Gather 'round.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:43.318
Maybe we should take a poll to see where
everyone's heads are at right now.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:48.323
Would you rather we bring the wedding
back to the hotel, where the big leak is,

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:51.326
or City Hall, with the bats?

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:53.411
Who... Who would rather have the bats?

01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:02.211
I'm pretty sure the bats are
not gonna be good for Noah.

01:29:02.295 --> 01:29:03.838
Pablo, thank you.

01:29:03.921 --> 01:29:07.216
The mayor expressed deep dismay,
saying he just heard about this right now,

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.302
and was far away from City Hall
when it happened,

01:29:09.385 --> 01:29:12.847
still mourning the passing of
local war hero Seymour Lustig.

01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:14.932
He said City Hall has been evacuated,

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:18.686
and will not be reopened until every bat
and every last pellet of bat feces

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.271
has been found and disposed of.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.606
Ay-ay-ay.

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:26.110
Well, I guess we'll have to re-book
the hotel if it's still available.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.112
My wedding is today, Mom.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:31.449
Sweetheart, I will get that done for you.
I promise you.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:38.498
Aw, Daddy will fix it.

01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:41.667
What can you do? It happens. Bats.

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.288
Powerful shit.

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:24.168
Powerful, meaningful shit.

01:30:33.177 --> 01:30:35.680
Whoop! There it is! Ah!

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:43.855
Under the rabbinical authority of
the West Hempstead Synagogue,

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:46.232
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:30:48.651 --> 01:30:49.652
Argh!

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:51.863
No! No!

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:53.447
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
- No!

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:55.658
What you're feeling is scary,
but not dangerous.

01:30:56.367 --> 01:30:57.618
You may kiss.

01:31:05.918 --> 01:31:07.295
Yes.

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.550
I just broke my heel.

01:31:13.217 --> 01:31:14.217
Yeah.

01:31:20.349 --> 01:31:21.809
She broke her shoe.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:24.854
- She broke her shoe.
- Stop. That's not your job anymore.

01:31:24.937 --> 01:31:28.191
- Just let him be the husband.
- Yeah, I know.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.035
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:32:03.434 --> 01:32:05.853
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:08.314
believers and skeptics,

01:32:08.397 --> 01:32:11.442
feast your eyes on the wonder that is...

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.361
the wedding party.

01:33:07.623 --> 01:33:08.623
Oh, ooh!

01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:16.424
We got us a ghetto wedding.

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:28.144
Yeah. Good pick.

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.796
You... You're not enjoying this, are you?

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:38.506
No, no, I'm good.

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:40.216
You don't look good.

01:34:40.299 --> 01:34:42.635
I mean, me?
I got a reason to be miserable.

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:44.929
I barely know my own family.

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.139
That's not true. They love you.

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:49.809
They gotta love me.
I... I write the checks.

01:34:49.892 --> 01:34:51.685
You? Your wife loves you.

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:52.978
Your kids love you.

01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:56.232
My kids love you.
Shit! My... My whole family loves you.

01:34:56.315 --> 01:34:58.192
Pally, why do you think...

01:34:58.275 --> 01:35:02.279
Oh, oh, guys, we're... We're talking.
Can you please just lift us back up?

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:06.826
Why do you think they give you grief,
your kids? Because they love you!

01:35:06.909 --> 01:35:09.745
It's different.
You were there when they needed you.

01:35:09.829 --> 01:35:11.080
I was chasing ass.

01:35:11.163 --> 01:35:13.707
Now, where...
Where did all this ass come from?

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:16.836
I was a young black surgeon in LA.

01:35:16.919 --> 01:35:19.964
It was like I was Dr. Denzel for 30 years.

01:35:20.047 --> 01:35:22.758
Okay. Okay, guys, guys.
I said we were still talking. Hold up.

01:35:22.842 --> 01:35:24.135
Please. Come on, pally.

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:27.096
Still plenty of time
to make it up to them.

01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:28.764
Plenty of time?

01:35:28.848 --> 01:35:32.435
I don't know about you, but this
kinda seems like the final act to me.

01:35:32.518 --> 01:35:36.439
No, no, no. This is just the start
of the next phase.

01:35:36.522 --> 01:35:40.693
Yeah, right! You look real psyched
about this next phase.

01:35:40.776 --> 01:35:42.069
What, I'm not psyched?

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:44.780
- Come on!
- Hey! Whoa, whoa!

01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:46.866
You kiddin' me? The man's talkin', here!

01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:49.118
I can't hold it anymore. Talk down here.

01:35:49.201 --> 01:35:52.663
It's a private conversation.
Come on, 30 more seconds.

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:53.998
I'm not psyched?

01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:55.249
You know what, pal?

01:35:56.041 --> 01:36:00.004
If I had dedicated my whole life
to my kids the way you did,

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:02.506
I'd be scared to face tomorrow, too.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:05.718
Dad.

01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:08.012
Dad, get the hell down!
Uncle Mark's gonna collapse!

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:10.431
- What's that?
- Damn it.

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:28.407
Save the veil!

01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:36.415
There's sprinklers.

01:36:50.179 --> 01:36:51.514
Where is the...

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:54.308
- Are you okay, babe?
- Yeah. Where's Sarah?

01:36:54.892 --> 01:36:56.810
Dad! Daddy, are you all right?

01:36:56.894 --> 01:36:58.497
I'm fine, I'm fine. I need to talk to you.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.773
I need to... Come here. I'll be, uh...

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:02.816
Gimme a minute. Just, everyone go.

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:10.241
- I love you.
- I know. Let's just get out of here.

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:11.825
I love you. I'm sorry.

01:37:12.576 --> 01:37:14.537
Dad. I know how hard you worked.

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.681
- I had to pay for it.
- You did everything you could.

01:37:16.705 --> 01:37:17.957
- I know.
- No.

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.127
I... I should've let Tyler's dad help pay,

01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:23.837
instead of being a big shot.

01:37:24.421 --> 01:37:27.508
I... I had to make the whole thing
about me.

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.972
Instead of, uh...

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:36.058
...just the wedding. I just...

01:37:36.141 --> 01:37:38.686
I didn't wanna
have to think about...

01:37:39.895 --> 01:37:41.230
About what, Dad?

01:37:42.606 --> 01:37:43.691
About...

01:37:47.444 --> 01:37:50.322
This is the last thing
I'm ever gonna get to do for you.

01:37:51.407 --> 01:37:53.117
I'm losin' you.

01:37:53.993 --> 01:37:55.619
Dad, you're not.

01:37:55.703 --> 01:38:02.084
Yeah, no, I am. I am. It's okay.
It's how it works. It's a crappy system.

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:05.212
But he's such a good kid.

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:07.298
He's the best, and I'm sorry.

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:12.136
And I'm sorry to both of you guys.
You deserve better than what I gave you.

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:15.681
I love you so much. Thank you.

01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:18.475
Thank you for saying that.

01:38:19.476 --> 01:38:24.440
You'll never lose me.
And I'll take you over any fancy place.

01:38:28.819 --> 01:38:31.905
Come on, you guys. We gotta get going.

01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:34.325
What? All right, where's the fire exit?

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.535
No, we gotta take the wedding pictures.

01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:40.247
- Are you insane?
- No, they found a room without a fire.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:41.790
Sir, we'll get it done quickly.

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:48.422
Can you guys get it together?

01:38:48.505 --> 01:38:50.716
Okay, yeah, absolutely.

01:38:50.799 --> 01:38:51.842
I'm sorry, uh...

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:54.136
Just give me one more try.

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:05.939
I don't think I've ever seen
Dad cry before.

01:39:06.023 --> 01:39:07.566
Mike Piazza's retirement.

01:39:20.746 --> 01:39:23.582
- Come on, guys. We'll put it here.
- Where's it go?

01:39:24.166 --> 01:39:26.543
Take 'er down. Take it.
Take it. There.

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:36.470
All right, come on. You wanna turn. Yup.
We got the brakes. This way!

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:40.683
I got three plates.
Here we go! Here we go!

01:39:57.074 --> 01:39:59.868
Hey, come on. Get some of this.

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:14.550
Hey, how's it goin'?
Lookin' good. Lookin' good.

01:40:14.633 --> 01:40:17.594
Hey, look who made it, man! You made it!

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:18.887
Just roll with it.

01:40:18.971 --> 01:40:22.141
- Hey, what's up?
- All right, good to see you, man.

01:40:22.224 --> 01:40:23.726
Thanks for having us.

01:40:24.393 --> 01:40:28.772
Sir, I see you really love your queens.

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:30.733
Big laugh.

01:40:32.234 --> 01:40:33.944
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:35.779
boys and girls of all ages,

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:38.532
the time is nigh.

01:40:38.615 --> 01:40:41.201
Watch and marvel

01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:45.080
as the bride and groom partake
in their first dance.

01:40:50.836 --> 01:40:54.757
Sarah, 23 years ago,
your great-grandmother, Yetta,

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.383
recorded this

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:58.302
just for this night,

01:40:58.385 --> 01:41:00.554
knowing she would most certainly be dead.

01:41:02.806 --> 01:41:04.016
Cue video.

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:12.024
This is for my little Sarah.
May you have a blessed marriage.

01:41:12.107 --> 01:41:14.818
That's... That's the woman in the painting
I said looks like you.

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:17.237
No. I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:50.938
And now, moms and dads,
join us in this wondrous ritual.

01:42:13.252 --> 01:42:16.630
- That's a good boy you raised there.
- You helped.

01:42:17.548 --> 01:42:19.216
You did about eighty percent.

01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:20.717
Eighty-five.

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.806
- You're a good woman.
- Thank you.

01:42:25.889 --> 01:42:27.808
And I love taking care of you.

01:42:28.767 --> 01:42:31.019
And I love taking care of Ignacio.

01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:33.355
He's like a foreign kid I get to sponsor.

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:38.110
Hey, Ignacio,
come and take your queen.

01:42:38.944 --> 01:42:40.946
I'm gonna find my princess.

01:43:07.764 --> 01:43:10.684
Did I tell you I love you this week?
Because I do.

01:43:10.767 --> 01:43:13.729
Uh, you might've said it a couple times.

01:43:13.812 --> 01:43:16.273
Ah, less than usual.
That's... That's not right.

01:43:16.356 --> 01:43:18.358
Are you happy? Or just drunk?

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:22.821
Ah! Both. I don't know.
This is just perfect.

01:43:23.405 --> 01:43:27.993
Oh, and the drizzled peanut brittle
was incredible.

01:43:28.076 --> 01:43:32.623
- Oh. You're not just saying that?
- Oh.

01:43:33.498 --> 01:43:36.710
Mmm. Totally worth the salmonella.

01:43:37.836 --> 01:43:38.837
And now,

01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:43.133
join us as we welcome in that most tender
of traditions,

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:45.928
the father-daughter dance.

01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:59.691
We never picked a song. I... I...

01:43:59.775 --> 01:44:00.859
I've got you.

01:44:16.291 --> 01:44:19.336
You went with Billy Joel,
even though I was a...

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:22.673
Yeah, even when...

01:44:23.173 --> 01:44:24.508
Very good.

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:28.178
You weren't making fun
of Billy Joel there, were you?

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:29.930
No, Dad, just you.

01:44:30.013 --> 01:44:32.641
- Ah. That's okay.
- Yeah.

01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:26.046
- I'm sorry. I guess I miss my dad.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:46:26.129 --> 01:46:28.090
You used to grope your dad's ass?

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:30.050
You're sick.

01:46:51.696 --> 01:46:52.864
You're not at the party.

01:46:52.948 --> 01:46:55.408
- You're not drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

01:46:59.621 --> 01:47:04.292
I'm just staying here with my parents
till I find a place that I like.

01:47:04.376 --> 01:47:06.670
- Uh-huh. Where's your room?
- Upstairs.

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:11.842
Give me, like, 30 seconds to clean up,
and then I'll, uh...

01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:49.671
- What's up? Everybody went to bed?
- Hey.

01:47:49.754 --> 01:47:52.757
Yeah, at 5:00 in the morning.

01:47:53.258 --> 01:47:55.194
Okay, so... What time do you think
they're getting up?

01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:56.818
I mean, we only need four for Parcheesi.

01:47:57.888 --> 01:48:00.682
I think they're probably sleeping
for the rest of the day.

01:48:00.765 --> 01:48:02.017
Yeah, but come on.

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:04.978
When are we gonna ever have
the family together like this?

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.647
I don't know. Thanksgiving?

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:13.778
You're right. But this time we're gonna
do it at my house in St. Lucia.

01:48:14.362 --> 01:48:16.698
St. Lucia? Whoa.

01:48:17.574 --> 01:48:19.534
I mean, that is an amazing offer.

01:48:19.618 --> 01:48:21.912
If we're doing that,
I better look into flights now.

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:23.914
No, pally, I got it all.

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:26.041
- It's all me. I got everything.
- No, listen...

01:48:26.124 --> 01:48:28.919
If I book this far in advance,
I can get a decent price.

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:30.212
I'm gonna get us a jet.

01:48:30.962 --> 01:48:33.924
A... Well, if you're doing that,

01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:36.509
you gotta at least let me
split the cost of the fuel.

01:48:36.593 --> 01:48:40.722
- You don't want that.
- Well, okay. Chinese food?

01:48:40.805 --> 01:48:42.575
- Can I bring Chinese food for the flight?
- Yes.

01:48:42.599 --> 01:48:44.368
- Can I at least do that?
- You can bring Chinese food.

01:48:44.392 --> 01:48:46.561
I like... I like orange chicken.

01:48:46.645 --> 01:48:49.498
You know, I hear if you buy it
five months in advance, it's pretty cheap.

01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:52.609
Uh... Oh, get out of here.
Okay. Very good.

01:48:52.692 --> 01:48:53.735
Very good.

01:48:54.903 --> 01:48:56.696
I want grandkids.

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.825
Yeah, well, we can't rush 'em. You know?

01:49:00.909 --> 01:49:02.035
- It'll happen.
- No, no.

01:49:02.118 --> 01:49:05.705
I... I wanna hold 'em
and... And change their diapies

01:49:05.789 --> 01:49:10.919
and just squeeze 'em
and sing silly kids' songs to 'em.

01:49:11.503 --> 01:49:13.463
Siri! What's a kids' song?

01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:16.091
"Wheels on the Bus"
is a kids' song.

01:49:21.721 --> 01:49:22.721
Did I... No.

01:49:23.139 --> 01:49:25.159
You're singing "Old MacDonald."

01:49:25.183 --> 01:49:27.060
Oh, sorry about that. Uh...

01:49:31.314 --> 01:49:32.954
You've lost your mind.
I'm going to sleep.

01:49:34.693 --> 01:49:37.112
Good night... doublet.

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:39.905
DJ Khaled!
