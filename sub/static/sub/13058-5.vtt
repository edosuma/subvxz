murders, you can.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.495
Maybe. I can show you
more easily in the RACR room.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.730
Come on.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.367
Provenza:
It's okay, Julio.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.336
I'm sure it's gonna
work out your way,

40:06.338 --> 40:10.707
despite my best efforts to keep
you from ruining your life.

40:10.709 --> 40:14.878
I don't know, sir.
She was skeptical.

40:17.716 --> 40:20.250
Hey, uh, Buzz,
could you -- could you hold on

40:20.252 --> 40:21.384
for just a second?
Sure.

40:21.386 --> 40:23.586
Okay, thanks.

[ Door opens ]

40:28.260 --> 40:29.392
Hey.

40:29.394 --> 40:30.760
Hey, Cynthia?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.662
Oh, Mr. Beck.
How are you?

40:32.664 --> 40:33.930
Uh, is,
uh, Detective Sanchez

40:33.932 --> 40:35.899
gonna get approved
to have a kid someday?

40:35.901 --> 40:38.735
[ Scoffs ] I see you haven't
gotten any less direct.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.737
Yeah, well, look.
I-I just want to let you know

40:40.739 --> 40:42.472
that he is a really, really
great guy.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.941
He's tough
but in the right way.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.976
How so?
Look, when I first met you,

40:46.978 --> 40:49.913
I didn't trust anyone,
and I was really angry,

40:49.915 --> 40:52.582
and letting go of that anger
was the hardest thing

40:52.584 --> 40:53.983
that I have ever had to do,

40:53.985 --> 40:57.454
and Julio understands that
better than anyone.

[ Elevator bell dings ]

40:58.924 --> 41:00.690
And, you know,
to some lucky kid,

41:00.692 --> 41:03.927
he would mean a-a shower
and a place to eat and shelter

41:03.929 --> 41:06.062
and clean clothes
and, most importantly,

41:06.064 --> 41:07.464
someone they can trust.

41:07.466 --> 41:10.266
And do you really think
that a homeless child

41:10.268 --> 41:13.036
would be better off living
on the street than with Julio?

41:16.708 --> 41:18.808
That's a good point,
Mr. Beck.

41:20.412 --> 41:22.712
You make
a very good point.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.882
It's great seeing you.
Take care.
