00:07.132 --> 00:08.258
- Whoops, sorry.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.760
- Oh, geeze.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.053
- What's this one called?

00:12.095 --> 00:13.596
- I lost my (indistinct).

00:15.181 --> 00:16.766
- Ridiculous.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.393
(group laughs)

00:18.435 --> 00:20.603
- We're healthy, but
we're desperately unhappy.

00:20.645 --> 00:21.521
- Right, okay.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.067
- Orlando, are you
going to do it?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.277
- I guess. Oh yeah.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.741
- We must do our exercises.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.117
- Oh shoot.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.410
What's this called?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.078
- Stretching the muscles.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.414
- Stretching the
muscles, okay great.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.127
Oh yeah, this is good,
really important.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.385
- Now you have to sit
down again, sorry.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.138
- Okay, sorry, Helen,
you got to go back down.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.056
- I gotta sit down?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.307
- Yes.
- I just got up.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.145
- Could you just say your
name and how old you are?

01:02.187 --> 01:04.439
Ziggy Susser 71.

01:04.481 --> 01:08.943
- Barbara Bova
72, soon to be 73.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.945
- My name's Alix Elias.

01:10.987 --> 01:11.863
- And Richard Marshall.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.239
She tells, she says to me-

01:13.281 --> 01:14.199
- Don't tell your age.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.116
- Don't tell anybody.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.326
Don't tell your age.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.911
- Tom Padovano 66.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.038
- Helaine Witt.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.956
My age? 71.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.500
- [Jo] 71.
- And a half.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.669
- Oh?
- In the few months.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.421
Like a kindergartner.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.298
- You could say,
generally speaking.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.257
- Yeah, generally speaking.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.550
- Generally speaking, a hundred.

01:32.592 --> 01:37.347
- My name is Evana Lewis
and I am 73 years old.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.184
- My name is Teresa
Hommel and I'm 76.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.560
- And you are, you're
wearing a mask.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.062
- I'm wearing three masks.

01:44.104 --> 01:48.900
- Hi, I'm Helen Yalof and
I am, ew, 86 years old.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.112
- My name is Nicki Cochrane.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.906
My date of birth
is May 10th, 1938.

01:54.948 --> 01:59.244
- My name is Bill Burke
and I'm 68 years old.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.330
- Will you tell me your
name and if you want to,

02:02.372 --> 02:03.540
you could tell me
how old you are.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.418
(laughs)

02:06.459 --> 02:09.462
- I'm Rebecca Dole, I'm 75.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.841
- I'm Orlando Dole, not 75.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.592
- Lynne Fetch, I will be 71.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.511
And I'm still playing singles.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.013
How do you like them apples?

02:18.054 --> 02:20.015
- Oh, I'm Bibi Elvers.

02:20.056 --> 02:23.143
And am I comfortable
saying my age?

02:23.184 --> 02:24.811
Of course, I'm proud of it.

02:24.853 --> 02:29.858
I'm 88 and a half
and going strong.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.776
- So this is pretty much like

02:31.818 --> 02:33.069
the comedy workshop
we do on Zoom

02:33.111 --> 02:34.571
but it's going to be in person.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.782
And we're gonna do some
exercises to get material going

02:37.824 --> 02:40.994
and then we'll do a
show in four days.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.871
No big deal.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.874
We're going to do a quick
just a roundup of ideas

02:45.915 --> 02:48.209
for what's the worst thing
to have on a T-shirt?

02:48.251 --> 02:51.171
Bill.
- Cream cheese.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.548
- I love me, not you.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.010
- A naked baby on a
T-shirt trying to wee wee.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.682
- What? A naked baby on
a T-shirt trying to shoot?

03:02.724 --> 03:06.311
- Holding his little
wee-wee. (laughs)

03:06.353 --> 03:08.063
- [Jo] Yeah, that's
a really bad T-shirt.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.065
- I saw this T-shirt yesterday

03:10.106 --> 03:11.608
Eat pussy, it's organic.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.319
- I couldn't hear. What was it?

03:14.361 --> 03:17.030
- Eat pussy, it's organic.

03:17.072 --> 03:17.906
- Eat what?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.449
- [Group] Pussy.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.911
- Come on Barbara,
make her say it again.

03:22.952 --> 03:23.787
(group laughs)

03:23.828 --> 03:25.497
Everybody make her say it again.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.749
- [Jo] Did you
have you done like

03:27.791 --> 03:29.834
performing arts or anything?
- No.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.170
- So, what got you to
sign up for the class?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.880
- Oh, I saw that and
I said right away,

03:33.922 --> 03:36.549
"I just, I would
love to do that".

03:36.591 --> 03:38.093
- And you've
never done it before?

03:38.134 --> 03:41.805
- No. In elementary school
I was always the one

03:41.846 --> 03:46.768
who like laughed and
said funny things.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.853
Got in trouble for
laughing all the time.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.981
Once the teacher wrote
"giggles"

03:52.023 --> 03:54.025
on my report card or whatever.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.320
- So, what do you like
about the comedy class?

03:57.362 --> 04:00.281
- I just like that
we're all together.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.950
We all contribute.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.451
It's just fantastic.

04:03.493 --> 04:07.497
Sometimes I am so awed by
the answers that people give.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.542
Really, they're fantastic.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.877
I love those bar jokes, oh God.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.046
- Who do you think would
play you in a movie?

04:15.088 --> 04:20.051
- (laughs) Oh, you know
who just came into my mind?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.262
I don't know if it was
because I thought of it

04:22.303 --> 04:24.055
or I just got it, Sandra
Bullock.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.893
She funny?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.855
- So what does everybody
prefer if you had the choice

04:31.896 --> 04:35.275
food jokes or sex jokes?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.902
- Food, did you say food?
- Yeah.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.029
- Food.
- Okay.

04:39.070 --> 04:39.904
- Sex.
- [Jo] Okay.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.115
- Food,
- Food.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.242
- Sex.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.201
- [Jo] Orlando,
you have not voted.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.287
- No, I go for sex jokes.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.456
- Barbara, you got one?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.249
- I got one a quick one

04:51.291 --> 04:52.959
and then I need help
with the second.

04:53.001 --> 04:57.255
Two peanuts were in a
bar, one was a salted.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.381
- One was a what?
- A salted.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.134
- Two penises?
- Peanuts. Peanuts.

05:02.719 --> 05:07.098
- So, the other one is that
if you get lox in the morning,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.060
a pop will freeze you at night.

05:11.603 --> 05:16.399
Soda pop lox bagel in the
morning freezer pop at night.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.568
I told you it needs work.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.362
- [Jo] (laughs) Okay.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.405
Well. Anybody has
any anything to add

05:22.447 --> 05:24.157
about bagels and
lox or freezer pops?

05:24.199 --> 05:27.202
Oh well, I said, "I tried to
push it up, to get the lip

05:27.243 --> 05:29.579
"but it went back down".

05:29.621 --> 05:30.789
- Oh that is good.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.791
That's how it's supposed to be.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.792
- Whoa.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.502
- The cook made a
cheeseburger.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.295
I told him, "I
needed a hamburger."

05:37.337 --> 05:39.506
And he said, "Do something
with the cheeseburger."

05:39.547 --> 05:40.840
So, I threw it at him.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.385
- Is that a glad to
see me in your pocket?

05:43.426 --> 05:46.262
- Making sex on a
Sunday is a bad choice.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.264
- Sex makes my hair curly.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.518
- A good pastrami sandwich
is as good as an orgasm.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.605
- I worked for a few jobs,

05:55.647 --> 05:58.525
but my biggest, longest
job was a social security.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.943
I was a claims representative.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.320
I interviewed people to
see if they qualified

06:02.362 --> 06:04.656
for like an SSI program,
things like that.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.866
And the best, the best
story I have from work is

06:06.908 --> 06:09.411
that I interviewed a woman
who told me she worked

06:09.452 --> 06:10.829
at a Whole Foods and I said,

06:10.870 --> 06:12.664
"I used to go to the
one on Houston Street.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.165
I loved their bread pudding."

06:14.207 --> 06:17.752
And she said, "Oh my God, I
made their bread pudding".

06:17.794 --> 06:19.421
35 years at work and that's
the most exciting thing

06:19.462 --> 06:20.922
that ever happened to me.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.633
Meeting a person who makes
bread pudding at a Whole Foods.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.302
- Why did you decide to
take this comedy class?

06:26.344 --> 06:28.346
- I've always been funny,
like my whole life kind of,

06:28.388 --> 06:30.682
but you know, never
formally funny.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.225
I would always crack people up,

06:32.267 --> 06:35.353
make jokes with friends or
whatnot, but I never pursued it.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.565
Like I thought of it, but
I was too scared, you know.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.735
Like you really have to
give up a lot to pursue it,

06:41.776 --> 06:43.653
to really make a career
of it and everything.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.740
I used to have a dream to
end up on TV, you know,

06:46.781 --> 06:48.324
like the big thing, you know,

06:48.366 --> 06:49.159
to be on the "Tonight
Show"

06:49.200 --> 06:50.785
blah, blah, blah.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.329
Umm, now I know that
it'll never happen.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.040
You know, it it
it's a fulfillment.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.085
It's part of me that
I can tap into now.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.130
And it's great that I have
that opportunity to do it.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.131
- Alix, you got one?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.341
Is it food or sex?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.802
- Well, I was trying to do both,

07:07.844 --> 07:10.930
but tomatoes having
sex equals ketchup.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.182
[group Laughs]

07:12.223 --> 07:13.641
- Let's see, Lynn, you got one?

07:13.683 --> 07:17.312
- Is this okay from when
Mayor Lindsay was mayor?

07:17.354 --> 07:18.813
That's when I heard it.

07:18.855 --> 07:23.860
- I do have an encyclopedic
memory for jokes.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.945
Something will trigger it off

07:25.987 --> 07:28.573
and it's just in the
back in the Rolodex.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.575
- So, do you know
what joke about a cat?

07:32.035 --> 07:34.454
- The one about the little boy
goes to school and he's late.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.998
So, the teacher says,
"Why are you late?"

07:37.040 --> 07:38.833
He says, "I stopped
to look at a dead cat

07:38.875 --> 07:40.669
by the side of the road".

07:40.710 --> 07:43.004
She said, "Well, how'd,
you know, it was dead?".

07:43.046 --> 07:45.548
He says, "I pissed in its
ear and it didn't move".

07:45.590 --> 07:46.925
"You did what?"

07:46.966 --> 07:50.053
"You know, I went psst
and it didn't move".

07:50.095 --> 07:51.346
- Dinosaurs.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.015
- Two dinosaurs were
on the edge of a cliff

07:54.057 --> 07:58.395
and they see Noah's Ark sailing
away with all the animals.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.106
So, one says to the other,
"Oh, is that today?".

08:02.399 --> 08:04.693
- Can you tell me the
dirtiest joke, you've heard?

08:04.734 --> 08:08.196
- The man goes to the doctor
for his annual physical.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.448
And he says, "You know, you
have to stop masturbating".

08:10.490 --> 08:11.700
He goes, "Why?".

08:11.741 --> 08:13.910
He says, "Cause I'm
trying to examine you.".

08:13.952 --> 08:16.162
(Jo Laughs)

08:22.335 --> 08:24.045
- 30 wow.
- Wow.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.298
- For other ways to
describe dog feces.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.718
- Poodle noodles.

08:29.759 --> 08:30.844
- [Jo] (laughs) Poodle noodles.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.345
- Oh that's cute.

08:32.387 --> 08:36.683
- Digestive ex-cremation.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.560
- Pet extrusions?

08:38.601 --> 08:39.686
- What to smell?

08:39.728 --> 08:41.730
- Autumn color display.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.648
- Think of something.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.442
- Doggie gift?

08:45.483 --> 08:46.818
- Doggie do do do.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.194
- We met as children.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.656
I was 12 and he was like 15.
- 35.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.701
(all laugh)

08:54.743 --> 08:56.286
- Our fathers were friends.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.121
- Our fathers were friends
in college for God's sake.

08:58.163 --> 08:58.830
- In college.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.081
- Isn't that crazy?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.291
- So, we both ended
up being actors.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.001
And Richard found out
through his father.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.461
- My father called me and said,

09:04.502 --> 09:07.797
"Alix Elias is coming to
New York to be an actress".

09:07.839 --> 09:10.925
- Anyway we ended up
briefly dating at the time.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.594
Which was broken up
by my evil roommate.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.595
I won't tell that story.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.429
- Don't tell that story.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.972
- Bad story.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.601
So, then we didn't see each
other for about 25 or 30 years.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.228
And then we ran into each
other at Jefferson Market.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.521
- Jefferson Market.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.231
- And then so, he
sneaked up behind me

09:25.273 --> 09:28.401
in line and goosed
me and I was so mad.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.235
- She wouldn't talk to me.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.111
- What is goosing?

09:30.153 --> 09:31.237
- Well, we were standing in line

09:31.279 --> 09:33.031
and she wouldn't talk
to me I went plbh.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.784
- And the next day we ran
into each other on 5th Avenue,

09:35.825 --> 09:37.077
right near where I live.
- Right.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.787
- And he burst into tears.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.830
He was sobbing on 5th Avenue.

09:40.872 --> 09:45.001
So, we have not been
separated since.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.378
It was kind of like--

09:46.419 --> 09:47.962
- And everyday I sob.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.382
It's like, same thing, you know?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.342
She likes it and I don't care.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.302
- [Jo] Who here's single?

09:54.344 --> 09:55.178
Single.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.054
Who here's married?

09:57.681 --> 09:58.973
- We're married.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.809
- I'm married but
I'm kind of single.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.352
(Alix laughs).

10:02.394 --> 10:04.104
- Anyone have observations

10:04.145 --> 10:06.147
about being single
or being married?

10:06.189 --> 10:07.065
What it's like?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.274
Yeah what is being single like?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.193
- It's you look at
these guys and you say,

10:10.235 --> 10:12.946
"Do I want a Anthony
Hopkins type or do you want

10:12.987 --> 10:17.409
a Harry Styles type?"

10:17.450 --> 10:20.704
My father used to say,
"I've been happily married

10:20.745 --> 10:23.790
for 30 years. 30
out of 50 ain't bad."

10:23.832 --> 10:25.125
- Any other observations

10:25.166 --> 10:27.502
about being married
or being single?

10:27.544 --> 10:29.004
What it's like?

10:29.045 --> 10:31.548
- Well, I was never any good
at dating or anything like that

10:31.589 --> 10:32.590
so I just um you know.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.217
(phone ringing)

10:34.259 --> 10:35.802
- [Jo] I think we have
somebody's cell phone ringing.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.262
- We have music here, coming?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.138
- I hear that.

10:38.179 --> 10:38.930
Is that me?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.181
I think it's a hearing aid.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.558
- [Jo] No, I think it's
a cell phone, maybe.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.435
- Oh, I hear it now.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.270
- [Jo] We have a popular crowd.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.896
- Rebecca.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.399
- Who would you say laughs
more between the two of you?

10:49.441 --> 10:50.525
- I do.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.569
(all laugh)

10:52.610 --> 10:54.237
No sense of humor.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.322
- That's what she's always
laughing at everything.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.033
Becky, there's nothing
to laugh about, you know.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.326
(Rebecca and Orlando laugh)

11:00.368 --> 11:02.662
- Do you remember
your first date?

11:02.704 --> 11:05.165
- No. She needed
someone to fix her...

11:05.206 --> 11:07.417
Handyman to fix her-
- A loft bed.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.626
- A loft bed.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.171
- You know, eventually
he fixed it.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.673
And he told me a joke
and it made me laugh.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.634
And that's when I fell
in love with him.(laughs)

11:16.676 --> 11:18.261
- Do you remember the joke?

11:18.303 --> 11:21.056
- He said, you know, "Was
I still doing acting?"

11:21.097 --> 11:22.349
And I said, "Yeah, sometimes."

11:22.390 --> 11:26.519
And he said, "Well, you
know, I go to auditions,

11:26.561 --> 11:29.272
"but you know, they say,
you know, you're too tall,

11:29.314 --> 11:31.983
"you're too short, you're
too fat, you're too thin.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.152
"But what they really
mean is you're too old."

11:34.194 --> 11:34.861
(Jo laughs)

11:34.903 --> 11:36.154
I started laughing.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.533
We looked into each other's
eyes and that was it.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.244
- I'm just going to say words.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.872
And you just say whether
it's funny or not funny.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.667
By itself, okay?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.001
Ready?

11:51.169 --> 11:52.087
Peanuts.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.505
- [Group] Funny.
- And salt.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.841
- Okay, how about treadmills?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.468
- Not at all.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.844
- Very serious.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.221
- Gerbils?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.139
- Definitely funny.
- Gerbils?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.349
- [Jo] Gerbils are funny?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.475
- With Richard Gere.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.019
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.479
- How about band-aids?

12:09.521 --> 12:11.481
- I loved them when I was a kid.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.359
I used to put them on all
the time, I loved them.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.111
Really did.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.487
- And they were hilarious.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.280
- Pumpkins?

12:20.365 --> 12:21.574
- I don't think so.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.659
- Pumpkin's are not funny?

12:22.701 --> 12:24.327
- Neutral.
- Pumpkins are neutral.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.120
- Neutral, yeah.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.371
- Okay what about ghosts?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.539
- Goats?
- Yes.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.707
- Goats.
- Ghosts.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.874
- Goats.
- Oh the greatest of all time.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.668
No, no ghosts.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.877
- Goats G-O-A-T-S?

12:32.919 --> 12:33.795
- No ghosts.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.838
- Goats are funny.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.172
- Honey, have you seen my goat?

12:36.214 --> 12:37.924
- Okay, how about milk.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.175
Is milk funny?

12:41.720 --> 12:42.470
- Milk is white.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.181
- I think what we're
going to do right now is

12:45.223 --> 12:46.850
now, that you have
your pen and paper,

12:46.891 --> 12:48.977
you're gonna write down
three to five things

12:49.019 --> 12:50.895
that you think about every day.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.398
Tequila, do you have a list of
things you're thinking about?

12:53.440 --> 12:54.899
- Do I get up now?

12:54.941 --> 12:59.195
Then do I go to the
diet app on my phone?

12:59.237 --> 13:01.489
And the only other
thing I can think of is

13:01.531 --> 13:05.452
do I kill those roaches
with a sponge or my hand?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.037
(group moans)

13:07.078 --> 13:10.248
- So, you are, you are
still working as a reporter?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.833
- Yep.
- And a photographer?

13:11.875 --> 13:13.168
- Yeah, I am.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.294
- It's important to
note that you are,

13:14.336 --> 13:17.589
I would say somewhat
New York famous.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.840
- No.
- [Jo] Yes.

13:18.882 --> 13:19.841
- No.
- Yes.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.676
- In a very small circle.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.219
A very minute.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.846
- My dog Walker said, "You
know, Tequila Minsky?"

13:24.888 --> 13:26.014
- But she doesn't know me.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.016
She just saw my byline.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.559
- That's fame.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.019
(Tequila laughs)

13:31.061 --> 13:32.354
You're famous.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.232
- Renown, but not quite famous.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.026
- Do you have a
plan for the show?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.695
- You know gripes.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.571
You have gripes?

13:44.699 --> 13:46.493
- Is my name Tequila Minsky?

13:48.453 --> 13:52.874
Well, life is a performance,
but to be on this stage.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.084
This is the stage?

13:54.125 --> 13:57.212
I don't, the performing
doesn't bother me.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.173
It's like the material,
having good material,

14:00.215 --> 14:04.386
my own good material that's
what makes me extremely anxious.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.262
- Barbara what are your
things you think about?

14:06.304 --> 14:12.268
- I have walk Morgan, study,
monkey yo-yo on YouTube,

14:12.310 --> 14:15.939
I love him and his
family. Eating food

14:15.980 --> 14:18.024
and feeling only good.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.818
- Okay, how about you Nicki?

14:19.859 --> 14:25.031
- Every day I watch the
colossal failure of our world

14:26.157 --> 14:30.161
become more and
more irreparable.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.832
Every day, I wonder
why ignorance rather

14:33.873 --> 14:37.377
than its opposite
is on the increase.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.755
Every day, I lose
all hope for mankind.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.298
- Wow.

14:42.340 --> 14:46.594
Every day, I wonder when the
world, as we know it, will end.

14:47.262 --> 14:47.929
- Thank you, Nicki.

14:47.971 --> 14:48.972
Thank you.

14:49.014 --> 14:49.806
(group laughs)

14:49.848 --> 14:51.057
- Quite uplifting.

14:55.020 --> 14:55.937
- That's great, thank you.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.814
- I love comedy.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.315
It is a true gift.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.985
I think it's like taking
medicine for your health.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.361
- What's the end goal?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.947
Do you want to make theater?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.699
Do you want to make comedy?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.159
- I just want to learn.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.785
I thrive on edification.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.163
I have to learn a hundred
new things every day.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.124
- You had mentioned
that comedy is a gift.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.001
- Oh, absolute a gift.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.462
I know now, I know
it sounds strange

15:20.503 --> 15:22.172
because I don't
believe in rel...

15:22.213 --> 15:24.674
I would like to abolish all
religions from the world

15:24.716 --> 15:26.426
and all gender from the...

15:26.468 --> 15:29.846
I think gender is such
a terrible concept

15:29.888 --> 15:31.598
and it creates so much harm.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.434
And you know, I dunno
this human impulse

15:34.476 --> 15:36.644
to put us in boxes all the time.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.272
Now the Nazis were
famous for that.

15:39.314 --> 15:43.068
By the way, I'm very, very
obsessed with the Holocaust.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.195
You can't believe that
it actually happened.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.613
You think that you're
going to wake up

15:46.654 --> 15:48.698
from this nightmare
that it never happened.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.533
Germany hasn't learned anything.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.910
Do you know what they're
doing in Germany, now?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.328
- Nicki, I just I
think the question -

15:53.370 --> 15:54.954
- They're wiping out
the hundred year old

15:54.996 --> 15:58.124
thousand year old villages
to make way for coal mines.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.501
- It's awful.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.753
But I think the question
was if comedy is a gift.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.380
- Oh yes it is, yes.

16:04.839 --> 16:09.094
But I would like to be funny,
but not in an artificial way.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.220
You know, genuinely funny.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.138
- I think that you
are genuinely funny.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.390
- You do?
- [Jo] Yeah.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.933
- Really?
- [Jo] Yes.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.267
- You're the first person
who's ever told me that.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.603
- Ziggy, what are
your five things?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.647
- Well, I'm obsessed
with my bird.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.525
So, where's the bird?

16:23.566 --> 16:25.193
Look, I don't know where he is.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.153
Does he have to poop?

16:27.195 --> 16:29.030
Did he eat enough?

16:29.072 --> 16:30.782
Does he want his head scratched?

16:30.824 --> 16:33.618
You know, what's the bird doing?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.620
- [Jo] How do you
get the bird to poop?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.789
- Well, I can tell
when he's about to poop

16:37.831 --> 16:39.374
cause he starts to back up.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.918
So, I put my finger under his...

16:41.960 --> 16:43.253
This is true.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.337
I put my finger
under his stomach,

16:44.379 --> 16:45.880
he goes on my finger

16:45.922 --> 16:47.549
and I put him on the edge
of the little garbage pail.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.842
And if he's facing
the right way,

16:48.883 --> 16:50.385
the poop falls in
the garbage pail.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.803
If he's not, it's outside.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.013
But at least it's getting close.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.514
- That's fantastic.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.392
You have such contact with such
a closeness with your bird.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.601
- Okay, Bibi, how bout you?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.311
What are you things,
you think about?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.605
- One of the things I think
about is what time is it?

17:02.647 --> 17:07.152
"Where did I put" is a constant
thing, no matter what

17:07.193 --> 17:10.655
because I'm a hoarder
in my apartment.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.782
It's beyond upside down.

17:12.824 --> 17:17.829
I have stuff going
back to report cards.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.083
Hair that was removed
from my head during

17:22.125 --> 17:24.294
some surgery 30 years ago.

17:24.336 --> 17:25.795
But I still have the hair.

17:25.837 --> 17:28.173
- When do you find yourself
looking for this stuff?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.966
(Bibi laughs)

17:30.008 --> 17:32.010
- So what do you think you're
going to do for the show?

17:32.052 --> 17:34.471
- I thought I might bring

17:34.512 --> 17:37.807
a very limited number
of actual items

17:37.849 --> 17:39.184
that I was telling you about.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.437
My husband's knee bone

17:42.479 --> 17:46.024
when he had his total
knee replacement.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.317
They're not supposed
to give it to you,

17:47.359 --> 17:50.320
but he was, he was one
who would never let go.

17:50.362 --> 17:51.321
He was lots of fun.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.489
He should be in this class.

17:52.530 --> 17:56.618
Well, he died two years ago.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.870
But other than
that, he should be

17:58.912 --> 18:01.247
in your comedy workshop.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.582
- What makes you laugh?

18:02.624 --> 18:04.084
- Oh, just about anything.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.879
Because I love to see the
funny in things for myself.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.005
- Do you just kind of...

18:09.047 --> 18:12.008
You just see humor in every day?

18:12.050 --> 18:15.845
- You know, you have to.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.807
In some ways it's a
survival strategy.

18:18.848 --> 18:23.770
If you can't find humor
in life, that's very sad.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.856
And you have been just great.

18:26.898 --> 18:31.861
And I envy your grandparents
to have somebody, I'm serious.

18:31.903 --> 18:35.073
There's no decades between us,

18:35.115 --> 18:36.408
even though there should be.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.077
But the decades don't
exist when you're here.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.706
And there's so many things
you don't know about me.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.082
- Yeah?

18:44.124 --> 18:50.755
- Spent many, many years
working, on site, digging

18:50.797 --> 18:55.885
for dinosaur bones and--
It's very serious stuff.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.971
- I understand, I
just did not hear...

18:58.013 --> 18:59.639
I didn't expect you to say that.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.725
So what else, what else
do I not know about you?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.768
- Mammoth bones too.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.895
In South Dakota,
there is a huge place

19:05.937 --> 19:08.857
with lots of mammoth bones.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.192
- So, what we're going to
do is we're going to break

19:11.234 --> 19:12.527
for lunch pretty soon.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.987
But what I want you to do is,

19:14.029 --> 19:16.740
so you have an assignment
for this afternoon.

19:16.781 --> 19:21.786
You have to write a three to
four line poem that rhymes.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.831
- On any subject?

19:24.873 --> 19:26.249
- On any subject.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.085
It can be maybe inspired by
what we talked about today.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.378
If you want to do it all

19:30.420 --> 19:34.966
about grapefruits or
intercourse or gerbils

19:36.009 --> 19:37.510
but a three to four line poem.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.306
- Gluten-free bagel,

19:41.348 --> 19:42.766
anybody want half of
a gluten-free bagel?

19:42.807 --> 19:44.601
- I'll take half if you
don't want it, thank you.

19:44.642 --> 19:48.021
- And help yourself to
bagels or coffee or.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.564
Oh, you want just an egg.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.524
- A ham sandwich
walks into a bar

19:51.566 --> 19:55.653
and the bartender says, "I'm
sorry, you can't come in here".

19:55.695 --> 19:58.865
The sandwich says, "Why not?".

19:58.907 --> 20:01.868
"Cause didn't you
see that sign on the door?

20:01.910 --> 20:05.288
"We don't serve food".

20:05.330 --> 20:06.956
(Jo laughs) Okay.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.291
- Thank you, Teresa.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.001
Thank you for
sharing that with me.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.212
Beautiful.
- But I didn't make it up.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.505
- It's okay.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.632
- But I did laugh for
at least 20 minutes.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.342
I'm very paranoid.
- I understand.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.635
It's okay.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.596
- And I tape them
because I don't want

20:21.638 --> 20:23.348
any COVID sneaking in the side.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.017
- Okay. Great.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.145
And what, what inspired you
to take the comedy class?

20:29.187 --> 20:30.897
- I'm ready to laugh.

20:30.939 --> 20:35.527
- So, you weren't
ready to laugh until.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.654
- Well, I have, I
was very serious.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.490
You know, I was very
serious corporate trainer.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.825
- Until when?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.868
- Until the pandemic and
I didn't have any work.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.328
- Really?

20:45.370 --> 20:47.664
You were very serious
until the pandemic.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.082
- Yeah.

20:49.124 --> 20:52.502
And then I'm like, "Hey,
let's have more fun here".

20:52.544 --> 20:54.587
- And then you signed
up for a comedy class?

20:54.629 --> 20:56.589
- Immediately. Yes.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.843
- And do you think that you
have a goal with comedy?

20:59.884 --> 21:02.303
- You know, I think
people need to laugh more.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.055
I think I need to laugh more.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.391
I may be late, but
it's not too late.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.060
- And this is
veggie cream cheese?

21:09.102 --> 21:10.979
Oh, this is plain cream cheese.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.856
- This is lactose
free cream cheese.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.358
- You're more inspired
by Joan Rivers or...

21:15.400 --> 21:16.651
- Yeah.
- Joan Rivers?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.445
Yeah, because I used to
listen in the eighties

21:18.486 --> 21:19.529
and channel her through me.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.698
Like, I would think like her

21:21.740 --> 21:24.242
and then I'd send jokes to
her because she had an album.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.201
- You'd send jokes to her?

21:25.243 --> 21:26.286
She said them on Johnny Carson.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.078
I have a video.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.748
Of her telling two of my jokes.
- Really?

21:29.789 --> 21:32.000
- One bomb, she
said it three times.

21:32.042 --> 21:35.712
- In the eighties, there was
a song by Olivia Newton John.

21:35.754 --> 21:38.173
Let's get physical, physical.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.593
So, she comes out and she
goes, "Today is income tax day.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.721
"And my accountant is dancing
around the office singing,

21:44.763 --> 21:48.224
"Let's get fiscal
fiscal.", like fiscal year.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.351
- Let's get fiscal.

21:49.392 --> 21:50.268
Let's get fiscal fiscal.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.145
And then she said it again.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.938
- Let's get fiscal fiscal.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.483
- And then she said
that the third time.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.193
- Let's get fiscal fiscal.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.155
- She was angry that they
weren't laughing loud enough.

22:02.197 --> 22:05.408
More than that, she was
just singing it three times.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.701
I thought it was
gonna be a hot joke.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.536
- And what did you
do before this?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.538
- Well, I'm a retired teacher.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.416
And now I dabble
in stand up comedy.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.293
- And what is your
goal with comedy?

22:15.335 --> 22:16.753
- You know what my goal is?
- What?

22:16.795 --> 22:20.423
- That I make people laugh.

22:20.465 --> 22:24.052
What I want is just
to be so funny.

22:24.094 --> 22:27.138
- So, you've done comedy
like for a long time.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.058
What do you think was one of
the greatest days of your life?

22:30.100 --> 22:34.270
- Oh the day I got a pink
envelope from Joan Rivers.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.438
That was a thrill.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.773
- What did it say?

22:36.815 --> 22:38.983
- These are the jokes
we're buying from you.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.443
- How much did you
get paid per joke?

22:40.485 --> 22:42.445
- Only $10, but
let me defend her.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.030
Had to be brand new every day.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.658
Should she give
everybody so much money

22:46.700 --> 22:49.536
for five or 10 minutes
worth of material?

22:49.577 --> 22:51.037
- How much money would
you pay for a joke?

22:51.079 --> 22:54.165
- Hmm. I don't
know, Jo that's...

22:54.207 --> 22:57.043
You're asking me really
provocative challenging ques...

22:57.085 --> 22:59.713
Larry King, you
shouldn't know from this.

22:59.754 --> 23:02.007
You should really hear Jo.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.383
These are, I don't know.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.968
I don't know.

23:05.010 --> 23:05.927
Rest in peace.

23:08.013 --> 23:11.599
How would you like to be
in this head, Jo? (laughs)

23:13.268 --> 23:16.438
- I've never eaten
yogurt with a fork before

23:16.479 --> 23:17.605
but there's no spoon.

23:18.857 --> 23:19.816
- Let me get you a spoon.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.695
- Okay, so are we ready?

23:23.737 --> 23:25.822
Evana, would you like
to share your poem?

23:25.864 --> 23:26.906
- Sure.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.908
- Standing in the dark shadow,

23:28.950 --> 23:31.494
watching my reflection
on the wall.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.455
As I gazed on my shadow,

23:33.496 --> 23:35.832
I thought, what a wonderful
sight.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.335
Maybe I imagined the reflection,

23:38.376 --> 23:41.338
but to my surprise,
I saw it again.

23:41.379 --> 23:45.800
What a wonderful sight to see
as I step outside of my shade,

23:45.842 --> 23:48.261
I know it was great
to be in that spot,

23:48.303 --> 23:51.014
but to my acknowledgement,

23:51.056 --> 23:53.725
it was reflection
of my own self.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.019
- Wow.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.730
- Evana, where did
this come from?

24:00.565 --> 24:03.693
You wrote that in
like 30 seconds.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.363
What did you do before
this, professionally?

24:06.404 --> 24:07.697
- Okay, I work for the

24:07.739 --> 24:11.534
New York City Human
Resource Administration.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.286
- So, what do you do when
you're not in this class?

24:13.328 --> 24:16.748
- I take a maybe about three
or four classes a day on Zoom.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.291
- Three or four?
- Everyday.

24:18.333 --> 24:25.465
- I take exercise, Tai-Chi,
group session, yoga exercise.

24:25.507 --> 24:30.637
And then, in the evening I be
on prayer line with my church.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.555
You know, I do ministry.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.140
I preach.
- You do?

24:34.182 --> 24:35.767
- Yes I do, I do preach.

24:36.851 --> 24:37.977
So, sometimes I
maybe I'll sit down

24:38.019 --> 24:40.230
and write a little sermon.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.398
- Who makes you laugh?

24:41.439 --> 24:42.565
- You know, depends on, it.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.943
Could be anybody depends
on what they say.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.655
I love to laugh, you know
because laughing is very good
for you.

24:49.781 --> 24:52.033
- What, what is your
laugh sound like?

24:52.075 --> 24:54.619
(Evana laughs)

24:57.163 --> 24:59.582
- Oh a laugh that
make you feel so good?

24:59.624 --> 25:01.668
You know, it open up everything.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.837
- And what would you say
is your outlook on life?

25:03.878 --> 25:07.590
- Well, my outlook is,
I'm enjoying my retirement

25:07.632 --> 25:08.800
and I love it.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.094
I do what I want to do,

25:11.136 --> 25:12.512
get up when I want to get up,

25:12.554 --> 25:15.724
wear what I want to wear and
I say what I want to say.

25:18.643 --> 25:22.063
- Evana. I, I I'm sorry
that she went first.

25:22.105 --> 25:25.442
I'm sorry, but yeah, you
really set the bar very high.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.276
Okay. Bill.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.404
- It gets easier
now for everyone.

25:30.488 --> 25:31.448
- Set the bar low.

25:31.489 --> 25:32.782
- That bar was way up there,

25:32.824 --> 25:34.659
we gotta bring it
back down to earth.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.119
- Thank you.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.913
- There was a whale who
never failed during a gale.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.416
Wouldn't shut up
about the holy grail.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.710
(group laughs)

25:43.752 --> 25:45.086
- Thank you, Bill.

25:45.128 --> 25:47.630
What did you do
professionally before this?

25:47.672 --> 25:48.715
- Stagehand, I was a stagehand.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.216
Local One stagehand.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.926
- Did you do comedy
before this class?

25:51.968 --> 25:52.969
- No.

25:53.011 --> 25:54.220
- Did you ever want to?

25:56.639 --> 25:58.141
- Sure.

25:58.183 --> 26:03.021
Yeah. It just never crossed
my mind as a possibility.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.231
And then you came along.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.941
- And do you think like you
have the same sense of humor

26:06.983 --> 26:08.651
as most of the
people in the class?

26:08.693 --> 26:11.029
- I don't think we have
the same sense of humor,

26:11.071 --> 26:15.200
but different people in
the class do crack me up

26:15.241 --> 26:16.117
and are hilarious.

26:16.159 --> 26:20.205
Bibi is one who, who is so dry

26:20.246 --> 26:23.792
and if you're not
paying attention, you're
liable to miss it.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.710
But I think she's hilarious.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.504
- Does your wife
think you're funny?

26:27.545 --> 26:29.089
- The question's kind of broad.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.382
(Jo laughs)

26:30.423 --> 26:31.466
- But is she coming to the show?

26:31.508 --> 26:32.676
- Yes.

26:32.717 --> 26:33.760
- Are you nervous for the show?

26:33.802 --> 26:35.011
- I'm scared to death.

26:35.053 --> 26:36.680
- Really?
- Absolutely.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.181
- What are you scared of?

26:38.223 --> 26:41.351
- Never having done this in
front of a live audience before.

26:41.393 --> 26:44.062
You're pretty vulnerable.

26:44.104 --> 26:48.274
And you know, just telling
the joke is one thing,

26:48.316 --> 26:51.653
having them judge...

26:51.695 --> 26:53.655
Now throw in the lions.

26:53.697 --> 26:55.907
Yeah, okay.

26:55.949 --> 26:57.158
- Ziggy, you got one?

26:57.200 --> 27:01.079
- As I trickle,
I hold my pickle.

27:01.121 --> 27:04.541
I was circumcised
with a sickle.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.459
I hope you're not fickle.

27:06.501 --> 27:08.628
- Okay, thank you so much.

27:08.670 --> 27:09.504
Okay, let's see.

27:09.546 --> 27:10.797
Nicki, you have one?

27:10.839 --> 27:15.760
- Ode to my best friend,
Esteemed iPhone 8,

27:17.262 --> 27:21.182
ever present and ready to
fulfill my limitless quest

27:22.017 --> 27:24.060
for unquenchable edification.

27:24.102 --> 27:28.064
All I can say in,
grateful appreciation, is

27:28.106 --> 27:29.983
forever Merci Beaucoup.

27:31.943 --> 27:33.153
- And that was
about your iPhone?

27:33.194 --> 27:34.362
- Yes.

27:34.404 --> 27:37.032
It's an ode to my
iPhone, my best friend.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.616
- Can we see it one more time?

27:38.658 --> 27:41.077
- Oh, of course, I love it.

27:41.119 --> 27:41.911
Richard.

27:41.953 --> 27:43.538
- The Lord is my shepherd.

27:43.580 --> 27:44.497
(group laughs)

27:44.539 --> 27:46.416
No, that's not right, I'm sorry.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.502
Today is hot and sweaty.

27:49.544 --> 27:52.005
My girlfriend's name is Betty.

27:53.381 --> 27:57.802
I'd like to get her clothes
off, so she'd be cool and ready.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.763
(group laughs)

28:04.559 --> 28:07.187
So, you have some time,
cause the show's on Friday,

28:07.228 --> 28:08.855
- Friday?
- Friday.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.982
You have to do a three
to four minute set.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.609
- That's a long time.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.903
- Is that based on what
we said today or anything?

28:14.944 --> 28:16.071
- It could be anything.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.989
You can all do something
for three minutes.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.866
- Like I said, if you're
waiting for the laughs,

28:19.908 --> 28:21.117
it'll be a little more.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.327
- Lynne, might go
over a little bit,

28:22.369 --> 28:24.454
but everyone else
might go under.

28:24.496 --> 28:25.955
And who knows?

28:25.997 --> 28:28.083
So, think about the stuff
that you came up with today.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.459
And also maybe things
that you'd like to joke

28:29.501 --> 28:32.003
about in class, so far
for the whole year.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.213
- Should it be cohesive?

28:33.254 --> 28:34.589
Or could it be things
strung together

28:34.631 --> 28:35.882
or it should be...?

28:35.924 --> 28:39.219
- You know, you can
always use the, "anyway".

28:39.260 --> 28:39.969
- Anyway.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.680
Okay.
- Yeah.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.515
- Could I do a bar jokes?

28:43.556 --> 28:44.641
Walked into a bar?

28:44.683 --> 28:46.476
- Yes, definitely.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.144
- What's the set up gonna be?

28:48.186 --> 28:49.646
- A stage.
- A real stage?

28:49.688 --> 28:51.773
- There's gonna be a microphone.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.983
- Like this?
- Yeah.

28:54.025 --> 28:56.486
You guys are doing... this is
great.

28:56.528 --> 28:57.654
And you did a great class.

28:57.696 --> 28:58.780
So, give it up for yourself.

28:58.822 --> 29:01.574
(group applause)

29:02.951 --> 29:05.078
- I'm gonna bring up an
old show business joke.

29:06.371 --> 29:09.457
A fellow was complaining
to his friend. He said,

29:09.499 --> 29:12.877
"Oh, I have this terrible job,
terrible, terrible job".

29:13.920 --> 29:15.171
"What is it?"

29:15.213 --> 29:17.590
"Well, I go behind the
elephants in a circus

29:17.632 --> 29:22.470
"when they go around the circus
ring and I sweep behind him.

29:22.512 --> 29:25.557
"And the dung falls all
over me, all over my face,

29:25.598 --> 29:26.433
"all over my body.

29:26.474 --> 29:27.350
"It smells awful.

29:27.392 --> 29:28.560
"It smells terrible.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.103
"And even when I go home
afterwards and shower,

29:30.145 --> 29:30.979
"it doesn't come off.

29:31.021 --> 29:32.689
"It doesn't come off."

29:32.731 --> 29:33.690
So his friend says,
"Well, why don't

29:33.732 --> 29:35.608
"you just leave that job"?

29:35.650 --> 29:39.487
He says, "What, and
leave show business?".

29:40.864 --> 29:43.324
When I used to do singing, I
worked comedy into my act

29:43.366 --> 29:45.952
and to my introductions
and so forth.

29:45.994 --> 29:48.788
And usually I got good
at handling people,

29:48.830 --> 29:49.748
that would...

29:49.789 --> 29:51.541
What's the word?
- Heckle?

29:51.583 --> 29:52.459
- Heckle you.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.002
- Start singing.
- What?

29:54.044 --> 29:55.086
- I'm gonna heckle you.

29:55.128 --> 29:56.254
You gotta shut me down.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.590
- Gotta sing and
heckle heckle okay.

29:58.631 --> 30:02.260
*Toy balloon toy balloon*

30:02.302 --> 30:03.136
- You suck.

30:03.178 --> 30:06.681
*So, do you, my darling *

30:06.723 --> 30:11.436
* Why don't you come up and
sing with me, my toy balloon*

30:11.478 --> 30:12.437
- That was so great.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.481
Thank you, Helen.
- Thank you.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.192
- Wow, that was beautiful.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.151
- Good enough? Good enough?

30:18.193 --> 30:20.111
Well, I wrote the song.

30:20.153 --> 30:21.571
- When did you write it

30:21.613 --> 30:23.782
and are there other lyrics
besides toy balloon?

30:23.823 --> 30:26.368
- It was one of my
first songs I wrote.

30:26.409 --> 30:29.788
I did a play called
Aladdin Lived in Brooklyn.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.414
And I stuck it in the play

30:31.456 --> 30:33.249
as the song with
the princess song.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.501
- How's it go one more time?

30:34.542 --> 30:35.335
What's the chorus?

30:35.377 --> 30:38.672
*Toy balloon toy balloon *

30:38.713 --> 30:42.967
*Oh, come back and take me too *

30:43.009 --> 30:47.639
* With you I'd float
my toy balloon *

30:47.681 --> 30:50.975
* Anywhere, but here *

30:55.647 --> 30:56.439
- [Jo] Come on down.

30:56.481 --> 30:57.107
Hi Elaine.

30:57.148 --> 30:57.982
- Here's the booze.

30:58.024 --> 30:58.858
I don't drink.

30:58.900 --> 30:59.943
- Rebecca, come sit.

30:59.984 --> 31:00.777
- Who else would like one?

31:00.819 --> 31:01.986
It's non alcoholic.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.196
It's also warm.

31:03.238 --> 31:05.031
- L'Chaim, everybody.

31:05.073 --> 31:08.118
- Break a leg everybody.

31:08.159 --> 31:09.285
What was the thing
she said to you?

31:09.327 --> 31:11.037
"You got a pencil
in your pocket,

31:11.079 --> 31:12.956
were you happy to see
me?" is that the one?

31:12.997 --> 31:15.000
- Welcome everybody
to the party bus.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.752
(group applause)

31:19.087 --> 31:21.423
We're gonna get pumped up.

31:21.464 --> 31:24.509
We got a show in about
two and a half hours.

31:26.553 --> 31:27.303
Who can do a pump up?

31:27.345 --> 31:29.681
Who can pump everybody up?

31:29.723 --> 31:31.307
Yeah okay, go for it.

31:31.349 --> 31:34.102
- You can either meditate or
take some Quaaludes and relax.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.398
- She said, "Do you
have a pump up for us?".

31:38.440 --> 31:41.985
- Oh, well I'd love
some more champagne.

31:42.027 --> 31:44.487
- Evana, can you
pump everybody up?

31:44.529 --> 31:47.657
- You could either keep your
mouth shut or open it wide.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.284
(group laughs)

31:49.325 --> 31:50.660
- Tom, you gotta pump up?

31:50.702 --> 31:51.995
- We're going out there.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.705
We're gonna slay
them with jokes.

31:53.747 --> 31:55.165
We're gonna kill them.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.167
Ain't gonna have nothing left.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.711
We're gonna lay them lying
in the aisles laughing

31:59.753 --> 32:02.213
and gasping for air.

32:02.255 --> 32:03.840
- One two three, jokes!

32:03.882 --> 32:04.674
(group cheers)

32:04.716 --> 32:06.009
One two three, jokes!

32:06.051 --> 32:07.552
- [Group] One two three, jokes!

32:07.594 --> 32:10.013
- So, Tom, I couldn't
help but notice

32:10.055 --> 32:12.057
that you were not at the class.

32:13.224 --> 32:14.851
Can you account for
your whereabouts?

32:14.893 --> 32:17.103
- I was at my 9,
8:30 to 4:30 job.

32:17.145 --> 32:18.104
What's that?

32:18.146 --> 32:19.856
- That is HR.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.191
- You work in HR?
- Yeah.

32:21.232 --> 32:24.361
And they don't know
about my, this life.

32:24.402 --> 32:26.154
- They don't?
- No.

32:26.196 --> 32:28.156
It's like seriously is a secret.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.407
- Wow.
- Yeah.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.575
- Secret.
- I know.

32:30.617 --> 32:31.826
- Well it's safe with
me, I won't tell.

32:31.868 --> 32:33.370
- Thank you.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.288
- And so, so you're kind of
at this other level though.

32:35.330 --> 32:37.290
You're, you're doing comedy.

32:37.332 --> 32:39.584
You've been doing comedy
professionally for a long time.

32:39.626 --> 32:42.087
What does it feel
like being in a group

32:42.128 --> 32:44.631
where these people are doing
comedy maybe for the first
time?

32:44.673 --> 32:46.383
- I realize this is
not their background.

32:46.424 --> 32:47.717
They might've been professional
people and all that.

32:47.759 --> 32:50.512
But it's one of the
things I enjoy the most.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.263
Actually, when they give
somebody their answer, they go,

32:52.305 --> 32:53.848
"Oh, what's going
to happen next?"

32:54.933 --> 32:55.892
- Who would play you in a movie?

32:55.934 --> 32:57.227
- Al Pacino.

32:57.268 --> 32:58.895
- Who do you like to
make laugh the most?

32:58.937 --> 33:00.271
- The senior citizens

33:00.313 --> 33:03.233
because they're not
the usual comedy crowd.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.402
I think they take more
of a liking to me.

33:05.443 --> 33:07.153
Well, a few don't and
they throw things.

33:07.195 --> 33:08.488
But other than that.

33:08.530 --> 33:10.198
But then again, how far
can they throw things,

33:10.240 --> 33:11.449
you know, at that age?

33:11.491 --> 33:12.992
You know, I can't either.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.619
I'm not making fun of them,
you know, I, you know.

33:14.661 --> 33:17.163
But anywhere I could get
a laugh, I'm fine with.

33:17.205 --> 33:19.249
- Ah, I'm doing jokes.

33:19.290 --> 33:22.043
So you better get
this party started.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.169
- [Jo] Helen, you got one?

33:23.211 --> 33:24.295
- This is a song I...

33:24.337 --> 33:25.839
My first song I wrote.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.632
No, I wrote another
song before that called

33:27.674 --> 33:28.842
Charlie Is My Love.

33:28.883 --> 33:33.096
*Toy balloon toy balloon *

33:33.138 --> 33:38.226
* As you float up in the air*

33:39.310 --> 33:41.813
* John, Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt. *

33:41.855 --> 33:44.524
*His name is my name to*

33:44.566 --> 33:45.483
- God forbid.

33:46.609 --> 33:47.610
*When we go out*

33:47.652 --> 33:49.195
We're gonna get
back to the theater,

33:49.237 --> 33:51.239
we're gonna do a tech rehearsal.

33:51.281 --> 33:53.324
And then we're going
to do the show.

33:53.366 --> 33:55.744
And then, and, and then
you guys have the rest

33:55.785 --> 33:59.873
of your nights to take the party
bus, you know, around town.

34:00.957 --> 34:01.833
- What about lunch?

34:05.837 --> 34:07.464
- So, what you're gonna do is

34:07.505 --> 34:09.132
you're gonna, someone's
gonna open the curtain

34:09.174 --> 34:10.967
when your name is called.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.094
You're gonna go
through the curtain

34:13.136 --> 34:14.971
and you're going to
grab this microphone.

34:15.013 --> 34:17.057
And this is my other joke.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.309
And it just became
three minutes.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.602
Everybody see?

34:20.643 --> 34:22.354
Raise your hand if
you see the red light.

34:22.395 --> 34:24.439
I'm just gonna announce you
and then you'll come up.

34:24.481 --> 34:25.940
And if you need familiarity,

34:25.982 --> 34:27.984
if you're good on the
mic don't worry about it.

34:28.026 --> 34:29.027
- I'd like to try.

34:29.069 --> 34:29.986
- Okay, we'll go in order.

34:30.028 --> 34:31.279
How about that?

34:31.321 --> 34:32.280
- I've never spoken
in a mic before.

34:32.322 --> 34:33.531
Just speak into it?
- Yeah.

34:34.908 --> 34:35.825
- Good evening.

34:35.867 --> 34:37.035
Good afternoon everybody.

34:37.077 --> 34:38.995
- Tom comes up to the stage.

34:39.037 --> 34:40.830
- Oh.
- Thank you.

34:40.872 --> 34:41.664
- Smooth.

34:41.706 --> 34:42.540
- I'm Richard.

34:42.582 --> 34:44.501
And and a bar walked into...

34:44.542 --> 34:45.210
No wait.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.169
A guy walked into...

34:46.211 --> 34:48.088
A bartender went into the zoo.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.173
- Barbara Bova.

34:50.215 --> 34:52.175
- Yeah. Hi everyone.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.760
- Ugh.
- There you go.

34:53.802 --> 34:55.428
- Hello I'm Helen Yalof.

34:55.470 --> 34:58.807
- Okay, coming up to the
stage next it's Evana Lewis.

35:00.308 --> 35:01.976
- Hello. My name is Evana Lewis.

35:02.018 --> 35:03.228
I love to dance.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.813
Is there any tables
in this audience?

35:04.854 --> 35:05.855
- Okay.

35:05.897 --> 35:07.315
- Hello there.

35:07.357 --> 35:09.109
- New York New York
wonderful town.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.193
- Thank you.

35:10.235 --> 35:12.404
- Yay. Hello everybody.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.489
Coming to our performance.

35:14.531 --> 35:15.740
- And then you just
want to make sure

35:15.782 --> 35:17.242
that mic stays right
in front of your mouth.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.868
- Oh.
- Yeah.

35:18.910 --> 35:20.453
- Hello, mic.

35:20.495 --> 35:21.996
And hi, everybody else.

35:22.038 --> 35:24.791
I wanna thank you all for
coming to my bar mitzvah.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.918
- I can say you're
an actress and a singer?

35:26.960 --> 35:31.923
- I actually am a producer,
entertainer, playwright.

35:35.719 --> 35:36.344
- You hate me.

35:36.386 --> 35:37.220
- I don't hate you.

35:37.262 --> 35:38.304
- Sometimes I hate you.

35:38.346 --> 35:39.431
- Sometimes you hate me.

35:39.472 --> 35:41.141
- That's so great.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.517
How'd you make this?

35:42.559 --> 35:44.144
- Wanting to be a playwright,

35:44.185 --> 35:46.062
my advice to you is
to drop this for now

35:46.104 --> 35:47.397
and do something else.

35:47.439 --> 35:50.692
- Are you gonna be
doing the curtain?

35:58.825 --> 36:01.578
(general chit chat)

36:01.619 --> 36:02.454
- Hi.

36:04.372 --> 36:06.624
- Blah blah blah blah blah.

36:09.919 --> 36:10.670
Honey.

36:10.712 --> 36:11.338
Okay okay.
- Okay.

36:11.379 --> 36:12.714
- Okay okay.

36:18.303 --> 36:20.513
- Hi everybody.

36:20.555 --> 36:23.641
(audience applause)

36:27.520 --> 36:29.105
Thank you all for being here.

36:29.147 --> 36:31.566
You're a beautiful crowd.

36:31.608 --> 36:34.027
These people are very odd.

36:34.069 --> 36:37.655
I don't think there's a
regular one amongst them.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.951
Has anyone been to a 2:00
PM comedy show before?

36:41.993 --> 36:43.078
(audience laughs)

36:43.119 --> 36:44.037
Oh, you have.

36:44.079 --> 36:44.871
Okay, so you got the vibe.

36:44.913 --> 36:46.498
The vibe is nasty.

36:46.539 --> 36:50.043
I'm constantly shocked by what
everybody says in this group.

36:51.670 --> 36:54.089
But I'm excited
to start the show.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.674
(audience applause)

36:55.715 --> 36:56.883
- He's an incredible comedian.

36:56.925 --> 36:58.510
It's Tom Petavano.

37:00.261 --> 37:03.807
- I come from a poor family,
but let me tell you something.

37:03.848 --> 37:08.853
Every night my mother
had food on the table.

37:09.562 --> 37:11.147
I wish we had plates.

37:11.189 --> 37:13.525
(audience laughs)

37:13.566 --> 37:15.360
And then I'll never
forget this saying,

37:15.402 --> 37:20.073
"Mommy, I wanted a toy
truck for my birthday.

37:20.115 --> 37:23.326
"I didn't get one, I'm upset."

37:23.368 --> 37:26.663
She goes, "Shut up
you're 40 years old."

37:26.705 --> 37:28.289
- I love getting older.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.166
You know, I'm losing my hair,

37:30.208 --> 37:31.626
but I know where it's going.

37:31.668 --> 37:33.670
It's going to my knuckles.

37:35.213 --> 37:36.464
I love getting older.

37:36.506 --> 37:39.676
You know, at Wendy's I
get my coffee for free.

37:39.718 --> 37:41.344
Give it up for getting older.

37:41.386 --> 37:42.345
(audience applause)

37:42.387 --> 37:44.389
- My name is Helen Yalof.

37:45.765 --> 37:47.976
And if you ever meet me,
you can remind me of that.

37:49.102 --> 37:51.688
Jo, are you sure the
doors are locked, now?

37:53.773 --> 37:58.028
- I have been an aspiring
actress for the past 15 years

37:58.069 --> 38:00.321
and I'm still aspiring, so.

38:00.363 --> 38:03.450
(audience applause)

38:04.784 --> 38:06.703
- This next comedian coming
to the stage would like

38:06.745 --> 38:10.540
for me to tell you that
she is a great dancer.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.584
Put your hands together
for Evana Lewis.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.253
- So, I went into
the dentist he said,

38:15.295 --> 38:16.796
"How are you doing Ms. Lewis?"

38:16.838 --> 38:20.800
I said, "Doc, can you
give me implant instead

38:20.842 --> 38:22.719
of putting back my partial?

38:22.761 --> 38:25.263
He said, "No, you have
to make an appointment".

38:25.305 --> 38:27.640
"I was so disappointment".

38:29.726 --> 38:32.103
- My boss ever sees
this, I'm dead.

38:32.145 --> 38:35.065
(audience applause)

38:36.566 --> 38:37.525
Now I get to eat.

38:38.985 --> 38:41.404
- You know, I had my
thing under notes.

38:41.446 --> 38:42.906
Now I can't find it.

38:42.947 --> 38:44.616
It's called Justice.

38:46.284 --> 38:48.244
Oh, you found it.

38:48.286 --> 38:49.621
- Nicki Cochrane.

38:49.662 --> 38:52.332
(audience applause)

38:52.374 --> 38:54.084
- Well, good
afternoon and welcome.

38:54.125 --> 38:57.420
I'm so delighted that
you all came to watch us.

38:57.462 --> 39:00.090
There are people,
millions of people

39:00.131 --> 39:03.802
who say they believe
every word of the Bible.

39:03.843 --> 39:05.136
Okay, fine.

39:05.178 --> 39:08.765
But then I want them to
be logical and be aware

39:08.807 --> 39:11.935
of the consequences
of their belief.

39:11.976 --> 39:14.979
The Bible says an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth.

39:15.021 --> 39:18.274
So, I want you to follow
those consequences.

39:18.316 --> 39:21.277
The Bible advocates that.

39:21.319 --> 39:25.323
Our legal system today has
no connection to justice,

39:25.365 --> 39:26.908
but in the ancient world,

39:26.950 --> 39:30.453
they really, they really
cared about justice.

39:30.495 --> 39:33.289
- I was on a plane
and I overheard

39:33.331 --> 39:34.791
the conversation behind me.

39:34.833 --> 39:38.586
It was a southern girl
asking a northern girl,

39:38.628 --> 39:40.296
"So, where you all from?".

39:40.338 --> 39:42.173
And the snooty
northern girl says,

39:42.215 --> 39:44.801
"Well, I'm from a place
where they know better than

39:44.843 --> 39:47.679
to end the sentence
in a preposition".

39:47.721 --> 39:51.641
She goes, "So where
are y'all from, bitch?"

39:51.683 --> 39:54.102
(audience applause)

39:54.144 --> 39:58.565
Actually, that was
from Playboy magazine.

39:58.606 --> 40:00.692
- Lynne, that was great.

40:02.944 --> 40:04.487
- My mother, my
mother was a saint.

40:04.529 --> 40:06.865
I brought you inside
and I raised you.

40:06.906 --> 40:09.701
I fed you, you little
son of a bitch.

40:09.743 --> 40:12.620
- Oh, I can't say that.

40:12.662 --> 40:15.457
- I mean you little shit ass.

40:15.498 --> 40:17.208
Thank you.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.627
- That little shit ass.

40:19.669 --> 40:21.504
Coming up next to the stage,

40:21.546 --> 40:25.425
he's ridiculous but we love him.

40:25.467 --> 40:29.179
It is Bill Burke
everybody, Bill Burke.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.347
- Oh my god.

40:30.388 --> 40:33.308
(audience applause)

40:36.770 --> 40:38.188
- My wife left me recently.

40:42.108 --> 40:42.984
I was really sad.

40:44.069 --> 40:44.903
I was depressed.

40:46.404 --> 40:47.739
I went out and I bought a puppy.

40:47.781 --> 40:49.699
I bought a new motorcycle.

40:49.741 --> 40:51.868
Spent a lot of money
on drugs and alcohol.

40:52.994 --> 40:53.912
She's going to be really pissed

40:53.953 --> 40:56.122
when she gets home from work.

40:56.164 --> 40:59.042
(audience applause)

41:00.585 --> 41:02.962
- My new thesaurus is terrible.

41:03.004 --> 41:04.756
Not only that, it's terrible.

41:08.176 --> 41:10.345
What's red and bad for your
teeth?

41:11.471 --> 41:12.389
A brick.

41:12.430 --> 41:15.100
(audience laughs)

41:15.141 --> 41:15.934
My name is Bill.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.477
This has been my Ted Talk.

41:17.519 --> 41:18.687
Thank you.

41:18.728 --> 41:20.480
(audience applause)

41:20.522 --> 41:21.898
- He's so naughty.

41:24.150 --> 41:25.694
- It's just terrific.

41:28.154 --> 41:30.073
- This next comedian
coming to the stage.

41:30.115 --> 41:33.368
She's the Seamus
at her synagogue.

41:33.410 --> 41:35.245
It is Barbara Bova.

41:37.956 --> 41:41.334
- Two jumper cables walk
in and the bartender says,

41:41.376 --> 41:46.214
"Hey, you two, don't you
start anything in here".

41:46.256 --> 41:50.176
Julius Cesar walks in and
he asks for a martinez.

41:51.469 --> 41:54.556
The bartender says, "Don't
you mean a martini?"

41:54.597 --> 41:56.016
And he said, "No.

41:56.057 --> 41:58.018
"If I would have wanted two,

41:58.059 --> 41:59.853
"I would have asked
for a double.".

41:59.894 --> 42:03.732
- I was debating, how do
I kill these cockroaches?

42:03.773 --> 42:05.775
Do I use a sponge?

42:05.817 --> 42:07.944
Or do I use my hand?

42:07.986 --> 42:10.071
Now, yeah, I know
it's disgusting.

42:10.113 --> 42:12.365
I forgot to give
the trigger warning.

42:13.742 --> 42:15.118
- If I go for the sponge,

42:15.160 --> 42:17.370
it takes like one second
to go for the sponge

42:17.412 --> 42:18.788
before I go for the kill.

42:18.830 --> 42:21.291
That one second is a
really important second.

42:21.332 --> 42:23.543
You could lose ground
in that one second.

42:23.585 --> 42:25.879
Oh my God I'm dead.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.089
- The world is crazy, you know.

42:28.131 --> 42:29.883
No one knows what's
happening anymore.

42:29.924 --> 42:32.385
You know, everybody's
done sending.

42:32.427 --> 42:33.970
Nobody in the woods, you know,

42:34.012 --> 42:35.680
who is going, who is coming.

42:35.722 --> 42:40.852
And then everything goes, but
it's great, you know. (laughs)

42:42.270 --> 42:44.481
Cause I don't know where I'm
going or coming either, so.

42:44.522 --> 42:46.232
(audience applause)

42:46.274 --> 42:47.317
- Orlando Dole

42:48.693 --> 42:51.279
- If you asked me to
describe my figure,

42:51.321 --> 42:54.115
I wouldn't say that I
was an apple or a pear.

42:54.157 --> 42:57.494
I'd say I was a soft boiled
egg with breasts and...

42:57.535 --> 42:59.204
(audience laughs)

42:59.245 --> 43:02.832
Say you're on a date with a
guy you don't know.

43:02.874 --> 43:05.877
This is what he expects
you to be wearing. Okay?

43:05.919 --> 43:07.212
I mean, look at this.

43:07.253 --> 43:09.255
These are what I
actually am wearing.

43:09.297 --> 43:12.509
No, I'll show you.

43:12.550 --> 43:13.885
They're great. They're good.

43:13.927 --> 43:17.055
(audience applause)

43:18.473 --> 43:20.058
- Alix Elias!

43:22.560 --> 43:24.646
- They liked you a lot.

43:24.688 --> 43:25.939
- They liked you too.

43:25.980 --> 43:27.524
- This next comedian
would like you to know

43:27.565 --> 43:30.110
that she's been
retired for 30 years

43:30.151 --> 43:31.945
and she's never been busier.

43:32.987 --> 43:35.073
The one and only Bibi Elvers.

43:40.578 --> 43:41.788
- I am a hoarder.

43:41.830 --> 43:44.541
And I don't know how
to get rid of my stuff.

43:44.582 --> 43:47.293
And I can never find anything.

43:47.335 --> 43:48.753
This is just some.

43:50.880 --> 43:55.135
My favorite, absolute
favorite toy, when I was a kid

43:55.176 --> 43:58.096
when I was very young, is this.

43:58.138 --> 43:59.931
And he has a little
zipper pocket.

44:00.724 --> 44:02.267
His name is Dog Do.

44:03.810 --> 44:05.270
I didn't speak
English at the time

44:05.311 --> 44:09.524
but I had heard a few words
and Dog Do sounded just right.

44:09.566 --> 44:13.069
When, when my husband was
having his knee replaced,

44:13.111 --> 44:18.742
he begged the doctor to
give him his real bone

44:18.783 --> 44:19.868
after the operation.

44:20.952 --> 44:22.245
Well, they're not
allowed to do that,

44:22.287 --> 44:24.581
but he was a very persistent
man, my husband was.

44:24.622 --> 44:27.792
And that's what this is.

44:30.045 --> 44:31.421
These are his bones.

44:34.049 --> 44:35.967
Then there was my head surgery.

44:38.470 --> 44:41.139
Oh, I can't find it.

44:46.686 --> 44:49.856
Well, I'll finish down here.

44:49.898 --> 44:50.774
I'm fine.

44:50.815 --> 44:53.902
(audience applause)

44:55.195 --> 44:56.821
Two days after the surgery--

44:58.823 --> 45:01.868
(audience applause)

45:04.746 --> 45:08.541
This was on my bed table.

45:08.583 --> 45:10.377
And what it is is the hair

45:10.418 --> 45:15.131
that they had shaved
off me 30 years ago.

45:15.173 --> 45:18.551
I think, I think I'm a
little bit lighter now.

45:21.221 --> 45:23.014
Thanks for being so wonderful.

45:23.056 --> 45:26.184
(audience applause)

45:32.649 --> 45:33.608
- Bibi Elvers

45:34.693 --> 45:36.736
A true, a true champion.

45:36.778 --> 45:38.947
Incredible.

45:38.988 --> 45:40.448
- Was that on purpose?

45:40.490 --> 45:41.366
- What?

45:41.408 --> 45:42.659
- Were you falling on purpose?

45:42.701 --> 45:45.328
- Put your hands together
for Ziggy Susser.

45:45.370 --> 45:48.498
(audience applause)

45:48.540 --> 45:50.333
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

45:50.375 --> 45:52.002
It was an absolutely
soft landing.

45:52.043 --> 45:54.546
- We have a pet bird at
home, a small parrot.

45:54.587 --> 45:55.797
We called him Charlie.

45:55.839 --> 45:57.841
Bout a year ago,

45:57.882 --> 45:59.342
my wife was getting
up off the couch

45:59.384 --> 46:01.344
and she accidentally
stepped on him,

46:01.386 --> 46:03.388
flattened him out
like a pancake.

46:03.430 --> 46:06.349
He was okay but they
brought me to the vet

46:06.391 --> 46:08.935
and she said, "He doesn't
have any brain damage .

46:08.977 --> 46:10.145
"He doesn't have
any broken bones".

46:10.186 --> 46:11.396
I said, "How do you know?".

46:11.438 --> 46:12.772
She said, "He answered
all our questions."

46:12.814 --> 46:14.774
"We asked him who
brought you here?".

46:14.816 --> 46:17.444
He said, "Big foot".

46:17.485 --> 46:19.696
We asked him, "How did
the universe start?".

46:19.738 --> 46:22.157
He said, "Big bang".

46:22.198 --> 46:24.034
We asked him who's
your favorite character

46:24.075 --> 46:25.577
on Sesame Street?".

46:25.618 --> 46:27.328
He said, "Cookie Monster".

46:29.664 --> 46:31.666
I thought he would
say Big Bird too.

46:33.126 --> 46:34.044
I'm Ziggy Susser.

46:34.085 --> 46:35.545
Thanks, you've been great.

46:35.587 --> 46:38.506
(audience applause)

46:40.050 --> 46:42.177
- Ziggy Susser everybody.

46:42.218 --> 46:43.803
- Okay and if you
could just give

46:43.845 --> 46:46.890
a big round of applause to
everybody you saw tonight.

46:46.931 --> 46:48.725
If we could see
everybody take a bow.

46:48.767 --> 46:54.689
(audience applause)

46:57.817 --> 47:02.697
(light piano music)

47:09.621 --> 47:12.374
I just wanted to say
how great everybody was.

47:12.415 --> 47:15.043
And it was really a great
experience working with you.

47:15.085 --> 47:16.252
And I just wanted
to give everybody

47:16.294 --> 47:18.421
a rose like we're
on The Bachelor. Ok?

47:18.463 --> 47:20.465
- Wonderful.

47:23.259 --> 47:26.388
- Where did they wire the mic?

47:26.429 --> 47:27.764
- They did not.

47:27.806 --> 47:30.308
- Honey. I'll see you at home.

47:31.476 --> 47:32.936
- How would you
like some pictures

47:32.977 --> 47:35.021
from the back showing
all the seats?

47:35.063 --> 47:36.064
- But it's empty.

47:36.106 --> 47:37.399
Even though it's empty?

47:37.440 --> 47:38.900
- But it shows you how
many seats were here.

47:38.942 --> 47:40.193
It's still cool.

47:41.653 --> 47:43.655
- Did you guys help each
other write your sets

47:43.697 --> 47:44.698
or did you write
them yourselves?

47:44.739 --> 47:45.782
- We sort of fought over it.

47:45.824 --> 47:46.991
We had a fight?

47:49.035 --> 47:50.787
- I think we're
doing a group photo.

47:50.829 --> 47:51.663
- Oh that'd be great.

47:51.705 --> 47:53.164
I'd like to be in that.

47:54.290 --> 47:55.583
- I think what would
be Kind of funny is if

47:55.625 --> 47:57.669
you lied down in the front,
you know what I mean,

47:57.711 --> 47:59.713
with the rose maybe.

47:59.754 --> 48:00.547
Exactly.

48:01.923 --> 48:06.511
- When I get up in the
morning, you smile, you laugh

48:06.553 --> 48:08.722
because that's a
beginning of the day

48:08.763 --> 48:10.306
and that will help you
go through the day.

48:10.348 --> 48:13.184
Because the start off
with that energy in you

48:14.144 --> 48:15.645
and that laugh.

48:15.687 --> 48:17.689
And then you go on to
share it with someone else.

48:17.731 --> 48:18.773
And you keep them happy.

48:20.191 --> 48:21.401
It doesn't matter they
might have a bad day,

48:21.443 --> 48:23.903
but you give them a joke
and they start laughing.

48:23.945 --> 48:25.321
You feel good.

48:26.698 --> 48:31.327
Laughter it's like food
you put in your body.

48:32.162 --> 48:35.040
It keeps you going.

48:35.081 --> 48:36.666
It energize you.

48:36.708 --> 48:37.751
It keep you happy.

48:39.085 --> 48:40.837
And you know that you
go through the day,

48:40.879 --> 48:44.132
it's love and joy.

48:45.508 --> 48:47.719
You're not supposed to let
anybody take away your joy,

48:47.761 --> 48:49.387
just keep on smiling.

48:52.891 --> 48:53.683
I love it.

48:57.604 --> 48:59.147
- I'm gonna ask you
to finish the joke.

48:59.189 --> 49:01.191
Guy walks into a bar.

49:01.232 --> 49:02.942
- And he's not an alcoholic.

49:02.984 --> 49:04.194
They throw him out.

49:04.235 --> 49:08.406
- Say, "I want a
tequila on the rocks".

49:08.448 --> 49:10.408
- A guy walks into the bar,

49:11.534 --> 49:13.286
"Have you seen my
friend Phoebe?"

49:13.328 --> 49:15.497
"Phoebe who's to hell's Phoebe.

49:15.538 --> 49:18.708
"That's what I like to know
where the hell is Phoebe?"

49:18.750 --> 49:19.709
- That's a joke?

49:19.751 --> 49:20.293
- No, that's not exactly.

49:20.335 --> 49:21.461
That's not it.

49:21.503 --> 49:24.089
- He ordered a beer on the rocks

49:24.130 --> 49:26.132
and the bartender said,
"You're not old enough.

49:26.174 --> 49:28.134
"And besides we don't have any."

49:28.176 --> 49:29.886
- Two friends are
sitting on a bus.

49:29.928 --> 49:30.804
- One throws up.

49:33.306 --> 49:36.643
- Two friends are sitting
on a bus and...

49:36.685 --> 49:41.898
- One says, move to the
rear and the other leaves.

49:41.940 --> 49:42.857
- Then what happens?

49:44.067 --> 49:46.069
- That's a good question.

49:46.111 --> 49:48.279
- Two friends are
sitting on a bus.

49:48.321 --> 49:49.072
- And they didn't
pay their fare.

49:49.114 --> 49:49.989
They're thrown off.

49:50.031 --> 49:52.450
(Jo laughs)
