WEBVTT

00:07.012 --> 00:08.762
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:08.797 --> 00:11.465
Take Kaan and Associates and,
like, ten other management firms

00:11.517 --> 00:13.684
and put them in a blender
and strain the fat.

00:13.719 --> 00:15.686
It's nice when dreams work out, huh?
Yeah.

00:15.721 --> 00:18.672
You wanted me to own
you, and now I do.

00:20.192 --> 00:21.475
ROSCOE:
<i>Handbags, purses.</i>

00:21.527 --> 00:22.859
And you're making
this kind of bank?

00:22.895 --> 00:24.945
Not bad.

00:24.980 --> 00:26.980
But you're gonna give it a rest, right?
I will.

00:27.032 --> 00:30.484
Clyde has feelings for her.
Okay, so stop fucking her.

00:30.486 --> 00:31.985
KELSEY:
<i>I have mad respect for a guy</i>

00:31.987 --> 00:34.204
who'd give up top-shelf
genius vag for friendship.

00:34.239 --> 00:35.989
KELSEY:
<i>Just 'cause you want back in</i>

00:36.041 --> 00:37.874
doesn't mean I'm gonna
stop sleeping with Clyde.

00:37.910 --> 00:40.877
Isn't this what we discussed--
making K and A huge?

00:40.913 --> 00:42.379
Which victory means more to you?

00:42.414 --> 00:44.054
Saying "fuck you"
to my turnaround artist,

00:44.083 --> 00:46.383
or making serious
"fuck you" money?

MARTY:
Come on.

01:00.182 --> 01:01.682
Okay, watch your step.

01:01.684 --> 01:02.683
Yeah, right there.

01:02.685 --> 01:03.684
Okay, look, don't peek.

01:03.686 --> 01:04.685
If you... if you're peeking,

01:04.687 --> 01:05.686
you're gonna ruin it.

01:05.688 --> 01:06.687
Just keep coming, keep coming.

01:06.689 --> 01:07.688
I'll tell you when you can look.

01:07.690 --> 01:09.356
Hold on, hold on.

01:09.358 --> 01:10.691
Ya-da!

01:10.693 --> 01:12.025
(laughs):
Ta-da.

01:12.027 --> 01:13.360
(grunts)

01:13.362 --> 01:16.697
Three boutique consulting
firms acquired.

01:16.699 --> 01:20.367
Six more slated for acquisition
within the fiscal quarter.

01:20.369 --> 01:23.036
Double-digit market share
growth within the month.

01:23.038 --> 01:24.371
What?!

01:24.373 --> 01:28.375
Welcome to the golden age
of Kaan and Associates.

01:28.377 --> 01:31.378
A true Renaissance
where I am da Vinci,

01:31.380 --> 01:34.715
(chuckles)
uh, Copernicus...

01:34.717 --> 01:36.049
Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:36.051 --> 01:38.935
Come... Did... did you
just look me in the eye?

01:38.971 --> 01:40.187
Yeah.

01:40.222 --> 01:42.856
Get your fucking shit
and get out.

01:42.891 --> 01:44.858
Kick rocks, motherfucker,
you're fired.

01:44.893 --> 01:47.694
You're not...
seriously...?

01:47.730 --> 01:49.029
You're joking, right?

01:49.064 --> 01:51.198
Yeah, I'm joking.

01:51.233 --> 01:53.734
What, am I gonna fire you just
'cause you looked me in the eye?

01:53.786 --> 01:54.786
Get the fuck out of here.

01:54.787 --> 01:55.952
Phew.

01:55.988 --> 01:57.287
Phew, no.

01:57.322 --> 01:59.123
I'm firing you because
you're habitually late,

01:59.158 --> 02:01.074
your client optics
are sub-optimal,

02:01.076 --> 02:03.410
and HR says you're something
of a sexual predator,

02:03.412 --> 02:04.795
so, yeah, freak,
get the fuck out.

02:04.830 --> 02:05.796
Bounce.

02:05.831 --> 02:08.048
Run, don't walk, motherfucker.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.216
(clears throat)

02:09.251 --> 02:10.717
Okay, where was I?

02:10.752 --> 02:13.053
Oh, yeah,
and Machia-fuckin'-velli

02:13.088 --> 02:14.721
all rolled up into one.

02:14.757 --> 02:16.390
Oh, shit, you see me limping?

02:16.425 --> 02:19.393
Yeah, that's 'cause
my balls are so big.

02:19.428 --> 02:21.561
Whoever said
it was lonely at the top--

02:21.597 --> 02:23.397
thank you, sweetheart--

02:23.432 --> 02:24.731
never sat here.

03:02.137 --> 03:03.136
Roscoe?

03:03.138 --> 03:04.805
Good morning.

03:04.857 --> 03:06.139
Um, morning,
Mr. Andrews.

03:06.191 --> 03:08.308
How's your day so far?

03:08.360 --> 03:09.643
It's okay.

03:09.695 --> 03:10.977
That's good.

03:11.029 --> 03:12.979
Mine? Not great.

03:13.031 --> 03:14.314
Let me tell you why.

03:14.366 --> 03:16.316
I just spent the better portion
of the morning talking

03:16.368 --> 03:18.985
with Debbie Nichols' mom.

03:19.037 --> 03:19.986
Well, I say "talking."

03:20.038 --> 03:21.655
It was more her lecturing me

03:21.707 --> 03:24.491
on the devastating effect
that counterfeit handbags have

03:24.543 --> 03:26.326
on the fashion industry.

03:26.378 --> 03:30.997
I have just so much newfound
wisdom to impart to you.

03:31.049 --> 03:33.049
Shall we?

03:33.085 --> 03:35.051
Okay, so if we're all good
with the basic layout,

03:35.087 --> 03:37.053
I can have the design coding
done in a couple of weeks.

03:37.089 --> 03:38.338
Perfect.
Sounds great.

03:38.340 --> 03:39.339
All right.

03:39.341 --> 03:41.224
Uh, where you going?

03:41.260 --> 03:43.343
I should make an appearance
at my day job.

03:43.345 --> 03:44.845
If I don't show up
for a few weeks,

03:44.897 --> 03:46.513
the party app guys
start to notice.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.649
What's this?

03:49.685 --> 03:50.650
Happy birthday, Kels.

03:50.686 --> 03:51.651
Uh, I...

03:51.687 --> 03:52.903
I was just about
to say the same thing.

03:52.938 --> 03:54.688
Happy birthday, um,
from me as well.

03:54.740 --> 03:56.356
Uh, my gift was supposed
to arrive yesterday.

03:56.408 --> 03:58.692
Fucking USPS.
Two tickets to The Dirty Projectors?

03:58.744 --> 04:00.527
What are The Dirty Projectors?

04:00.529 --> 04:02.245
Are you f...? You
went on this huge rant

04:02.281 --> 04:03.281
about how they're genius.

04:03.282 --> 04:05.699
And how math rock is coming...

04:05.751 --> 04:07.250
You're fucking
with m... (groans)

04:07.286 --> 04:08.251
Ah...

04:08.287 --> 04:09.586
This is awesome, thank you.

04:09.621 --> 04:10.871
It's okay, kind of generic.

04:10.923 --> 04:12.539
J-Jeannie,
we got it covered, okay?

04:12.591 --> 04:13.874
Yeah, see you this afternoon.

04:13.876 --> 04:16.209
Uh, let me guess--
another doctors appointment?

04:16.211 --> 04:17.878
Uh-huh,
that's convenient.

04:17.930 --> 04:18.962
I know, right?
It's almost like

04:19.014 --> 04:20.380
she's having
a baby or some shit.

04:20.382 --> 04:21.765
MARTY: Literally didn't hear
a word you guys just said.

04:21.800 --> 04:22.766
Recon lunch, let's go.

04:22.801 --> 04:23.884
Oh, right.
Yeah.

04:23.886 --> 04:25.552
Hey.
Yes.

04:25.554 --> 04:27.604
See you tonight?
Yes, yeah, yeah.

04:27.639 --> 04:29.272
(clears throat)

04:29.308 --> 04:30.891
Aw.

04:30.893 --> 04:33.276
(clears throat)

04:37.482 --> 04:39.616
N...

04:39.651 --> 04:40.617
Nah...
Oh, my God.

04:40.652 --> 04:41.952
KELSEY (giggling):
Oh, oh, okay.

04:41.987 --> 04:43.286
Bye, Doug.
Yeah, that's...

04:43.322 --> 04:45.405
Hey, unbelievable gift
coming your way.

04:45.407 --> 04:47.073
You just passing
them out, or...?

04:47.075 --> 04:48.074
No?

04:48.126 --> 04:49.910
Hey, hey, wait.

04:49.962 --> 04:51.912
So both of you guys
are still...?

04:51.964 --> 04:52.913
You know,
Mm-hmm.

04:52.965 --> 04:54.047
knocking that out?
Uh-huh.

04:54.082 --> 04:55.215
How's that working?

04:55.250 --> 04:56.890
It is beyond great.
It's fucking terrible.

04:56.919 --> 04:58.718
That's two different answers.
Are you crazy?

04:58.754 --> 05:00.754
I love it. Not only do
I get to have mind-blowing

05:00.756 --> 05:02.756
commitment-free sex,

05:02.808 --> 05:04.891
the fact that Clyde is sharing
a similar experience

05:04.927 --> 05:06.226
is only bringing us that
much closer together.

05:06.261 --> 05:08.061
And you say?
It absolutely has not.

05:08.096 --> 05:09.930
Right.
And can you stop wearing

05:09.932 --> 05:11.097
that fucking cologne
to her place?

05:11.099 --> 05:12.265
That shit lingers for days.

05:12.267 --> 05:13.600
Afraid I can't do that, Clyde.
Why?

05:13.602 --> 05:14.935
Why, Doug? Why can't you do that?
(elevator bell dings)

05:14.937 --> 05:17.604
Well, because it's
my <i> fucking</i> cologne.

05:17.606 --> 05:18.939
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

05:18.941 --> 05:20.857
Mm-hmm.
Because Doug has a fucking cologne?

05:20.909 --> 05:23.193
- Oh, my God. - You mean a cologne
he wears while he's fucking?

05:23.245 --> 05:25.195
Don't you fucking...
Wh-What's it called?

05:25.247 --> 05:26.830
It's called Uninvited Guest.

05:26.865 --> 05:29.950
This could be our Holy Grail.
After 35 years,

05:29.952 --> 05:31.284
150 locations,

05:31.286 --> 05:32.836
a cult-like following,

05:32.871 --> 05:34.504
the Southern California
institution

05:34.539 --> 05:36.172
known as Shags Burger Shack

05:36.208 --> 05:38.508
is finally ready
to expand nationally.

05:38.543 --> 05:40.126
And now that CEO and founder

05:40.128 --> 05:41.511
Samuel Sullivan
is six feet under,

05:41.546 --> 05:44.130
son Luke Sullivan is
the newly-appointed

05:44.182 --> 05:45.465
Shag Godhead.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.017
And he is looking for a Moses

05:47.052 --> 05:49.352
to take his people
out of the SoCal desert.

05:49.388 --> 05:51.638
Marty, can we be that Moses?

05:51.690 --> 05:53.390
I think we are that
motherfucking Moses.

05:53.442 --> 05:55.308
You can't curse here, though.

05:55.310 --> 05:56.943
Uh, sorry, decent people.

05:56.979 --> 05:58.612
Quick question, if you don't mind.
Yeah, mm-hmm?

05:58.647 --> 06:00.647
The fact that
Luke Sullivan is an outspoken,

06:00.649 --> 06:02.198
Bible-thumping
denier of gay rights,

06:02.234 --> 06:03.700
a woman's right to choose?

06:03.735 --> 06:05.035
It's unfortunate,
but it doesn't mean

06:05.070 --> 06:06.319
his money is any less green.

06:06.321 --> 06:08.154
WOMAN:
Welcome to Shags Burger Shack.

06:08.206 --> 06:10.457
What can I get you?
Uh...

06:10.492 --> 06:12.325
how are the tacos?

06:12.377 --> 06:14.411
They're two for 99 cents.
Not what I asked.

06:14.463 --> 06:15.996
And yet you still
answered my question.

06:16.048 --> 06:17.213
It's a simple menu,
just order something.

06:17.249 --> 06:18.999
Greasy food wreaks
havoc on my system.

06:19.001 --> 06:20.500
You know that.
Marty Kaan.

06:20.502 --> 06:21.968
Hey, hey.
Back at the Shack.

06:22.004 --> 06:23.169
Never thought I'd see this.

06:23.171 --> 06:25.338
Do you still have time
for us to talk?

06:25.340 --> 06:27.140
Absolutely. Mm?
Yeah, great, great.

06:27.175 --> 06:29.843
- Uh, you know what? I'm just
gonna take my chances... - Doug.

06:29.845 --> 06:31.594
...yeah, with a-a salad.

06:31.647 --> 06:33.146
I'm afraid
we don't offer a salad.

06:33.181 --> 06:34.564
What does that mean?
You don't have lettuce?

06:34.599 --> 06:35.682
We have burger lettuce.

06:35.684 --> 06:37.350
What on Earth

06:37.402 --> 06:38.852
is burger lettuce?

06:38.904 --> 06:40.186
It's the lettuce
we put on burgers.

06:40.238 --> 06:42.072
The lettuce that they put on
burgers. They don't

06:42.107 --> 06:43.356
have s... J...
I'm s-I'm sorry,

06:43.408 --> 06:44.607
forgive me for my friend.

06:44.660 --> 06:46.026
He'll have a number one combo...
No.

06:46.028 --> 06:48.244
...or a bullet to the temple.
It's his choice.

06:49.281 --> 06:50.521
I'll get the number one, please.

06:50.532 --> 06:51.531
And a Diet Coke.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.199
You get your own drink.

06:53.251 --> 06:55.251
Of course you do.

06:57.039 --> 06:58.588
Come on, Charles.
Yeah, I need it.

06:58.623 --> 06:59.873
This is taking too long,
Charles, come on.

06:59.925 --> 07:01.041
It's here somewhere.
Okay, yeah?

07:01.043 --> 07:02.542
Look, we really
appreciate your insight

07:02.544 --> 07:04.594
on this pitch, but we are
under a time crunch...

07:04.629 --> 07:05.929
Found it.

07:05.964 --> 07:07.180
There you go.
Ooh!

07:07.215 --> 07:09.265
Teenage Marty.
Oh, wow.

07:09.301 --> 07:12.686
It is more beautiful
than I dreamed, Charles.

07:12.721 --> 07:14.241
Look at the embarrassment
in your eyes.

07:14.272 --> 07:16.222
The shame.
Flipping burgers.

07:16.274 --> 07:18.224
(laughs)
So depressing.

07:18.977 --> 07:20.193
Um...

07:20.228 --> 07:21.394
May-Maybe it was pride.

07:21.446 --> 07:23.697
Let me see it again.

07:23.732 --> 07:26.232
Oh, yes, that's what it is--
it's probably pride.

07:26.284 --> 07:27.734
This is really good, sir.
Hey. Okay,

07:27.786 --> 07:28.868
Charles, can we...

07:28.904 --> 07:31.538
Serious as ever.
Okay, inside intel.

07:31.573 --> 07:33.406
You know Luke Sullivan
is looking to maintain

07:33.458 --> 07:35.075
the same level
of product quality

07:35.127 --> 07:36.960
and customer service
Shags is known for?

07:36.995 --> 07:38.128
Yeah, but franchising
at the level

07:38.163 --> 07:39.412
that he's suggesting
makes that impossible.

07:39.464 --> 07:41.965
I know that's true,
you know that's true.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.134
Hell, deep down, I bet even he

07:44.169 --> 07:45.490
knows it's true.
But Luke Sullivan

07:45.504 --> 07:47.670
doesn't want
to be told the truth.

07:47.723 --> 07:49.806
He wants to be told
what he wants to hear.

07:49.841 --> 07:52.592
I mean, that's... good.

07:52.644 --> 07:53.893
I guess it's helpful, but

07:53.929 --> 07:55.095
is there anything else?
I mean, something

07:55.097 --> 07:56.096
that really gives us an edge?

07:56.148 --> 07:57.263
That is your edge.

07:57.315 --> 07:58.481
You stick to that,

07:58.517 --> 08:00.433
you'll be a top contender.

08:00.435 --> 08:02.569
So his big piece of advice

08:02.604 --> 08:04.821
was to tell the client exactly
what they want to hear,

08:04.856 --> 08:06.740
which is basically
what we do with every client.

08:06.775 --> 08:09.075
Well, I'm so glad I made
myself a prime candidate

08:09.111 --> 08:11.611
for heart disease for that.
Oh, you're smiling.

08:11.613 --> 08:14.114
You know I love it when you're
smiling after a meeting, Marty.

08:14.116 --> 08:15.498
Well, listen, every
other consulting firm's

08:15.534 --> 08:16.783
gonna give him what he wants.

08:16.835 --> 08:18.752
So let's reframe it.
Give him

08:18.787 --> 08:20.754
what he doesn't know he wants.
And that is?

08:20.789 --> 08:22.789
Well, if I knew what
that was, then you two

08:22.841 --> 08:24.361
could take the afternoon
off instead of

08:24.376 --> 08:26.376
going back and drilling
down deep on Shags,

08:26.428 --> 08:27.628
which is what you're gonna do.

08:27.679 --> 08:29.179
Get Jeannie in on it as well.

08:29.214 --> 08:30.597
Okay, and while
we're busting our ass

08:30.632 --> 08:31.681
you'll be, what?

08:31.716 --> 08:33.265
Oh!

08:33.301 --> 08:35.434
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. That
burger-- that's what it was.

08:35.470 --> 08:38.020
I-It's got my blood sugar
all over the map, and so I don't

08:38.056 --> 08:40.895
- know what that was. Ooh, let me
get that, Marty. There you go. - Okay.

08:41.476 --> 08:42.775
Buckle up.

08:42.811 --> 08:44.110
You got enough money for gas?

08:44.145 --> 08:45.645
It's an electric car, you idiot.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.981
Great, okay, uh, drive safe.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.451
MARTY:
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

08:51.486 --> 08:53.736
Yeah, I... Yes. Of course,

08:53.789 --> 08:56.539
we will see you in the morning.
All right, bye.

08:56.575 --> 08:58.491
Sorry about that.

08:58.543 --> 09:01.161
Sounded fun.
Uh, seems that my son's

09:01.163 --> 09:03.163
been caught turning
his passion for purses

09:03.165 --> 09:05.548
into a rather lucrative
black market business.

09:05.584 --> 09:06.883
That is shameful.

09:06.918 --> 09:09.002
Let me know if he ever
wants a summer internship.

09:09.054 --> 09:11.504
Have you decided?
Uh, yeah, Salad Nicoise.

09:11.506 --> 09:12.505
Yeah, I'm good

09:12.507 --> 09:14.641
with coffee, thanks.

09:14.676 --> 09:15.809
Had a double Shag burger.

09:15.844 --> 09:17.177
Course.
'Cause why eat in a

09:17.179 --> 09:19.259
Michelin-rated restaurant
when you can stop off for a

09:19.264 --> 09:21.064
Shag burger?

09:21.099 --> 09:23.850
Oh, you must be in the running
for their franchising consult.

09:23.852 --> 09:25.351
Yeah, we pitch tomorrow.

09:25.403 --> 09:26.853
Be a huge win for you guys.

09:26.905 --> 09:29.656
Significant media attention.
You'd be part of the story.

09:29.691 --> 09:31.191
Got to win it first.

09:31.243 --> 09:32.575
Yeah.

09:32.611 --> 09:33.743
I need you to not.

09:35.113 --> 09:38.198
I've got
a multi-billion dollar deal

09:38.250 --> 09:40.750
brewing with a certain
fast food competitor.

09:40.785 --> 09:42.452
I can't say who it is,

09:42.504 --> 09:43.586
but here's a hint:

09:43.622 --> 09:44.754
their arches are golden.

09:44.789 --> 09:46.422
Aha.

09:46.458 --> 09:48.708
And if they were to read
about the Shags expansion

09:48.710 --> 09:50.710
being spearheaded by a company

09:50.712 --> 09:52.712
under the Global umbrella...

09:52.714 --> 09:54.013
I don't need to finish
that thought, right?

09:54.049 --> 09:55.548
You want us out of the running?

09:55.600 --> 09:57.851
Well, I can't afford
your consulting for Shags

09:57.886 --> 09:58.852
to become newsworthy.

09:58.887 --> 10:00.937
But if you were to go in there

10:00.972 --> 10:02.856
and convince Luke Sullivan

10:02.891 --> 10:04.524
that now's not the time
for national expansion,

10:04.559 --> 10:06.309
make a strong case
to stay the course,

10:06.361 --> 10:07.527
shore up the SoCal market...

10:07.562 --> 10:09.062
Can't imagine
that'd be newsworthy.

10:09.064 --> 10:11.064
You could even
take credit for, um,

10:11.066 --> 10:13.366
you know, having some back room
influence on suppressing their

10:13.401 --> 10:15.235
national expansion.
I hadn't thought of it that way,

10:15.287 --> 10:16.736
but... I like it.

10:16.738 --> 10:18.238
(laughs)
It's a layup.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.123
Uh, there is one problem.
What?

10:20.158 --> 10:21.574
A stay the course strategy,

10:21.576 --> 10:22.909
that is a guaranteed loser.

10:22.911 --> 10:24.244
No such thing.

10:24.246 --> 10:25.847
Not when Marty Kaan's
doing the pitching.

10:27.749 --> 10:29.132
So we good?

10:29.167 --> 10:30.884
Oh, yeah, we're good.
We're all good.

10:33.338 --> 10:34.754
Hey, you know
I'd have been happy

10:34.806 --> 10:36.222
to split the cost
of those tickets with you.

10:36.258 --> 10:37.507
Ugh...
(sighs)

10:37.559 --> 10:39.642
Any idea what I should get her?
No. Nope.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.644
Come on. Why don't you help
an Eskimo brother out, huh?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.813
You know what?
I'm just gonna get her flowers.

10:43.848 --> 10:45.148
Yeah.

10:45.183 --> 10:46.766
Well, Kelsey doesn't
want flowers, Doug.

10:46.768 --> 10:49.652
Okay, I know a lot of girls say
they don't want flowers, Clyde,

10:49.688 --> 10:52.238
but trust me,
every girl wants flowers.

10:52.274 --> 10:54.607
Unless they're allergic.
Which Kelsey is. So...

10:54.659 --> 10:56.442
I feel like she may
not want flowers.

10:56.494 --> 10:57.694
Aw, shit.

10:57.746 --> 10:58.912
Um...

10:58.947 --> 11:00.113
Oh.

11:00.115 --> 11:01.247
Okay.

11:01.283 --> 11:02.248
I'm so afraid.

11:02.284 --> 11:03.783
When one door closes...

11:03.835 --> 11:04.834
Oh...

11:04.869 --> 11:06.119
I got it, even better.

11:06.121 --> 11:07.954
I'm gonna get her
a sexy teddy bear.

11:07.956 --> 11:10.089
Yes.
CLYDE: What the fuck is

11:10.125 --> 11:11.958
a sexy teddy bear? Yes.
Don't... look at him.

11:12.010 --> 11:13.259
You're encourage...
Agh!

11:13.295 --> 11:15.094
Why am I even
helping you with this?

11:15.130 --> 11:16.930
Why is "sexy bear" taking
me to all these gay sites?

11:16.965 --> 11:18.965
How long are you gonna
be okay with, uh,

11:18.967 --> 11:20.300
that sticking

11:20.352 --> 11:22.769
that in your girlfriend

11:22.804 --> 11:24.284
on a regular basis?
She likes us both.

11:25.307 --> 11:26.639
JEANNIE:
Marty,

11:26.691 --> 11:28.024
we've been digging
into Shags and...

11:28.059 --> 11:29.442
MARTY:
Got a change of plans.

11:29.477 --> 11:31.477
Okay? We're going with
a stay the course strategy,

11:31.529 --> 11:33.313
so I need you to start
building decks to support it.

11:33.315 --> 11:35.982
Stay the course? Why would we...
MARTY: Just do it.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:47.162 --> 11:48.628
So how was that lunch
with Denna?

11:48.663 --> 11:51.130
It's the play we gotta make.

11:51.166 --> 11:53.132
Okay.
I don't have a choice.

11:53.168 --> 11:54.634
Okay, okay.

11:54.669 --> 11:56.002
Will you just not "okay"
me to fucking death

11:56.004 --> 11:57.670
and tell me what it is
you came in here to say?

11:57.722 --> 12:00.173
I just...

12:00.175 --> 12:02.342
wanted to say I'm sorry.

12:02.394 --> 12:04.344
You're sor... Jeannie.

12:07.065 --> 12:08.848
Why are you sorry?

12:08.850 --> 12:11.684
I don't know what happened...

12:11.736 --> 12:12.685
(laughs)

12:12.737 --> 12:15.605
...or why, exactly,

12:15.657 --> 12:18.908
but I do know we have people

12:18.943 --> 12:20.526
to answer to now.

12:20.578 --> 12:21.527
And I know

12:21.579 --> 12:23.579
taking a dive like that

12:23.615 --> 12:25.081
is gonna make you

12:25.116 --> 12:26.532
fucking miserable, and...

12:26.584 --> 12:28.534
that's why I'm sorry.

12:38.513 --> 12:40.713
Ah, gang's all here...
and we're drinking.

12:40.715 --> 12:42.849
Take it easy
on your brother, Marty.

12:42.884 --> 12:44.217
He's had a rough day.

12:44.219 --> 12:46.686
Network passed on his pilot.

12:46.721 --> 12:49.856
- Mm-hmm. Then the girl he just
started seeing dumped him. - What?!

12:49.891 --> 12:51.024
Funny how now that
I'm not a TV star,

12:51.059 --> 12:54.227
I'm suddenly "full of shit."

12:54.229 --> 12:56.362
You were never a TV star, and
you've always been full of shit.

12:56.398 --> 12:57.730
CHANTELLE:
Well, I think

12:57.782 --> 12:58.981
it's her loss.

12:59.034 --> 13:00.149
Here.

13:00.201 --> 13:01.317
Oh, okay. So?

13:01.369 --> 13:02.869
Drink it.
So?

13:02.904 --> 13:04.370
So you want to
explain what happened?

13:04.406 --> 13:07.040
After I specifically told you
to stop selling purses.

13:07.075 --> 13:08.324
Dad, they're not purses.

13:08.376 --> 13:09.459
JEREMIAH:
I wouldn't be correcting

13:09.494 --> 13:11.294
your father's choice
of words right now,

13:11.329 --> 13:12.578
Roscoe.

13:12.630 --> 13:14.297
Thank you.
Okay.

13:14.332 --> 13:16.499
A couple months ago,
I sold a handbag

13:16.551 --> 13:18.584
to Deep Throat Debbie.

13:18.636 --> 13:19.752
Deep Th...
He said what?

13:19.804 --> 13:21.971
Yeah, that's what
everybody calls her.

13:22.006 --> 13:23.389
She gave it to her mom
who's a fashion designer.

13:23.425 --> 13:25.475
Dad, she's probably just
pissed because it took her

13:25.510 --> 13:29.562
this long to figure out.
Okay, well, here's what's gonna happen.

13:29.597 --> 13:31.431
We're gonna go down
to that school tomorrow,

13:31.433 --> 13:33.066
and you're gonna apologize
to the girl, and

13:33.101 --> 13:35.985
give the money back, and then
pray they don't suspend you.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.938
For real? That's the advice
you're gonna go with?

13:38.940 --> 13:40.106
Come on, Marty.

13:40.108 --> 13:41.774
Oh, Roscoe, you got
to fight this thing.

13:41.826 --> 13:43.493
Hey, Malcolm...
Oh, you bet your ass if.

13:43.528 --> 13:46.112
Thurston Howell III's
son got caught

13:46.114 --> 13:49.082
selling handbags, they'd be
throwing all kinds of parades

13:49.117 --> 13:50.997
and shit celebrating his
entrepreneurial skills.

13:51.002 --> 13:53.122
You got to fight this.
Listen. Roscoe broke the rules.

13:53.171 --> 13:55.788
Yeah, and he got caught.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.840
And now he's gonna
pay the price.

13:57.876 --> 14:01.461
Guess nobody can accuse you
of being a hypocrite this time,

14:01.513 --> 14:03.346
huh, Dad?

14:03.381 --> 14:06.432
Mm, that's 'cause
you went to jail.

14:06.468 --> 14:07.600
(door closes)

14:07.635 --> 14:09.635
(whispering):
He went to prison.

14:21.316 --> 14:23.316
There's a smell.

14:23.318 --> 14:24.784
There's a terrible...
Wha... Oh.

14:24.819 --> 14:25.979
And I fucking...
Fuck. I know.

14:25.987 --> 14:27.036
I know, I washed 'em yesterday.

14:27.071 --> 14:28.154
Can you say something to Doug?

14:28.206 --> 14:30.289
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah?

14:30.325 --> 14:31.420
I need to get away from it,
though, because... Yeah.

14:31.540 --> 14:32.374
Here, yeah, let's switch.

14:32.494 --> 14:34.494
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

14:37.332 --> 14:39.165
What?
Oh, no.

14:39.217 --> 14:40.500
Wha... What?
No.

14:40.502 --> 14:42.251
I can't. I ref... No.

14:42.303 --> 14:44.003
What? The bear?

14:44.005 --> 14:46.005
It's a fucking teddy bear
wearing lingerie!

14:46.007 --> 14:48.174
How does that make
any fucking sense?!

14:48.176 --> 14:50.176
Kelsey, that's not even
the fucking problem.

14:50.178 --> 14:52.178
Okay, if you're unhappy
with our arrangement...

14:52.180 --> 14:54.013
Yes, I'm unhappy
with our arrangement.

14:54.015 --> 14:55.231
I will tell you
I've been unhappy

14:55.266 --> 14:56.766
with our arrangement
the entire fucking time.

14:56.818 --> 14:58.568
I thought you said you'd been
in open relationships before.

14:58.603 --> 14:59.902
I have, but not with Doug.

14:59.938 --> 15:01.687
I mean, I share an office
with the guy. That's enough.

15:01.689 --> 15:03.022
Well, it seems like
you really decided

15:03.024 --> 15:04.357
to put your foot down
about this.

15:05.410 --> 15:07.410
All right, you know what?

15:09.414 --> 15:11.531
Um, I should go.
I'm gonna go.

15:11.533 --> 15:13.749
What?

15:15.370 --> 15:17.537
(sighs)
And it's not

15:17.539 --> 15:19.372
just that I don't want
to share you

15:19.374 --> 15:20.957
with someone
that I see every day.

15:21.009 --> 15:23.926
I don't want
to share you with anyone.

15:27.098 --> 15:30.049
Okay.

15:33.137 --> 15:35.555
Okay. All right.

15:35.607 --> 15:37.557
Okay.

15:37.609 --> 15:40.776
Oh, my God,
you are so insecure. No.

15:42.814 --> 15:45.114
Okay, I won't fuck Doug anymore.

15:45.149 --> 15:47.116
Or anybody else.

15:47.151 --> 15:49.235
Oh. Hmm. You know what?

15:49.237 --> 15:51.654
(laughs) That actually feels
like a lot of pressure.

15:51.706 --> 15:53.155
(laughing): Oh. Fuck off.
It's a lot at once.

15:53.208 --> 15:54.323
It feels like
you want to move in,

15:54.375 --> 15:55.741
it feels like you want
to get fucking married

15:55.793 --> 15:56.993
right off the bat.

15:57.045 --> 15:59.579
(laughing):
Oh, yeah.

15:59.631 --> 16:02.298
Hey, you want to know
what the worst part is?

16:02.333 --> 16:05.384
Guess which political pundit
they gave a show to instead?

16:05.420 --> 16:07.386
Who?

16:07.422 --> 16:09.422
Alfonso Ribeiro.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.674
Alf... Carlton?
Carlton

16:11.726 --> 16:13.593
from the <i> Fresh</i> fucking <i> Prince.</i>

16:13.645 --> 16:14.927
What?!
Yes.

16:14.979 --> 16:16.229
That's what they want.

16:16.264 --> 16:17.847
I mean, how is anyone supposed
to take this guy serious?

16:17.899 --> 16:20.816
You know, Carlton.

16:20.852 --> 16:23.102
(laughing)

16:23.104 --> 16:24.770
Well...
(laughing): No.

16:24.822 --> 16:26.739
...the idea
of affirmative action

16:26.774 --> 16:30.660
is reverse discrimination
is racism personified.

16:30.695 --> 16:31.827
Break it down.
You're stupid.

16:31.863 --> 16:33.362
Oh, my God.
Break it down. Break it down.

16:33.414 --> 16:34.830
Break it down.
Hey, for real.

16:34.866 --> 16:36.449
I'm-I'm really sorry you had
such a shitty day, Malcolm.

16:36.501 --> 16:38.618
You don't...

16:38.620 --> 16:42.204
Okay. Really? (sighs)

16:42.257 --> 16:44.290
Look, I know you're drunk,

16:44.292 --> 16:46.292
I know you just got dumped,

16:46.294 --> 16:48.711
but I'm gonna go to bed
with your father now,

16:48.763 --> 16:50.846
and try to forget this
little thing just happened.

16:50.882 --> 16:52.848
Okay?

16:52.884 --> 16:55.101
Excuse me.

16:57.889 --> 17:02.141
Too young for me anyway.

17:02.193 --> 17:03.526
Fucking Carlton.

17:04.561 --> 17:06.529
Here's your money back.

17:06.564 --> 17:08.531
I'm sorry.

17:08.566 --> 17:10.031
A hundred dollars?

17:10.068 --> 17:12.652
That's all for what you claimed
to be an original Valentino?

17:12.654 --> 17:14.654
That's all I charged Debbie.

17:14.656 --> 17:17.373
We had an arrangement.

17:20.411 --> 17:21.771
(whispering):
Dad, it was her idea.

17:21.796 --> 17:23.713
Okay, you two, get to class.

17:27.251 --> 17:30.553
Hmm. Well,
I can't even

17:30.588 --> 17:32.221
begin to imagine what
drove him to this.

17:32.256 --> 17:34.006
You know, he must
have really had a

17:34.008 --> 17:36.008
tough go of it.

17:36.010 --> 17:37.259
No, not really.

17:37.312 --> 17:39.679
Kids just do stupid
shit sometimes.

17:39.681 --> 17:42.264
Well, in my day, it
was a stolen six-pack.

17:42.317 --> 17:44.767
You know, maybe a little weed.

17:44.819 --> 17:46.852
You feel me?
Oh, I feel you.

17:46.854 --> 17:50.022
Definitely wasn't designer drugs
paid for by selling illegal

17:50.074 --> 17:52.108
knockoff handbags.
(Marty laughs)

17:52.160 --> 17:53.693
Wait a minute.
Who said anything about drugs?

17:53.745 --> 17:54.860
Oh, I'm hearing rumors

17:54.862 --> 17:57.363
about very well-funded parties.

17:57.415 --> 18:00.950
Wow. Well, I've heard a couple
rumors about rainbow parties,

18:01.002 --> 18:02.284
but other than that...

18:02.337 --> 18:03.536
I should be going.

18:03.538 --> 18:05.204
Whatever is decided here,

18:05.206 --> 18:08.424
I'm sure Roscoe will
land on his feet.

18:08.459 --> 18:10.042
Thanks for the concern.
Mm-hmm.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.714
Yikes, huh?

18:14.766 --> 18:16.446
Could she be a little more
fucking cryptic?

18:16.467 --> 18:18.884
For better or worse--

18:18.886 --> 18:20.553
usually for worse--

18:20.555 --> 18:23.055
she has a lot of influence
in our school community,

18:23.057 --> 18:25.808
and she wants Roscoe expelled.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.394
Ex...? He sold a couple
of fucking fake purses.

18:28.396 --> 18:29.729
Are you kidding me?

18:29.781 --> 18:31.313
Roscoe really hit a nerve here.

18:31.366 --> 18:33.449
Marty, I'm telling
you this as a friend.

18:33.484 --> 18:35.201
Oh. A friend?

18:35.236 --> 18:36.452
Okay. Fantastic.

18:36.487 --> 18:38.738
Now, why don't you just
fucking say it?

18:38.790 --> 18:41.073
Maybe it would be
best for Roscoe

18:41.125 --> 18:43.242
if he were to finish
his education elsewhere.

18:43.244 --> 18:45.995
Yeah. Certainly be a lot less
embarrassing

18:46.047 --> 18:47.797
for the school, right?

18:47.832 --> 18:50.833
He wants to be here, okay?

18:50.885 --> 18:53.669
He likes it here.
I want him here.

18:53.721 --> 18:56.255
So, you know what? Maybe
we're gonna fight this thing.

18:56.257 --> 18:57.857
Maybe we're gonna get loud.

18:57.892 --> 19:01.143
We'll tell our side of the story
to the diversity committee.

19:01.179 --> 19:02.728
How about that?

19:02.764 --> 19:04.013
I'm mean, that shouldn't
be too hard

19:04.065 --> 19:05.481
for them to squeeze us in,
right? You got what,

19:05.516 --> 19:06.816
like a dozen black families
enrolled?

19:06.851 --> 19:08.017
I got to tell you, John.

19:08.069 --> 19:10.686
For a school that charges
a shitload of money

19:10.738 --> 19:12.104
based on the promise of a

19:12.106 --> 19:13.606
progressive education,

19:13.608 --> 19:15.191
that number seems
pretty low to me.

19:15.243 --> 19:16.442
Okay. I get it.

19:16.494 --> 19:18.277
You do? 'Cause
I haven't even started in

19:18.329 --> 19:21.113
on the whole "persecution of the
gender fluid teen" aspect.

19:21.115 --> 19:22.448
But that's coming.

19:22.450 --> 19:24.700
You want to get loud?
That's your right.

19:24.752 --> 19:26.285
You can turn this whole
thing into a circus,

19:26.287 --> 19:28.788
you can make Roscoe's
humiliation

19:28.790 --> 19:30.372
as public as possible.

19:30.425 --> 19:32.291
Or Roscoe can have

19:32.293 --> 19:33.626
a fresh start somewhere else.

19:33.628 --> 19:35.845
Play it either way,
but one way or another,

19:35.880 --> 19:37.430
Roscoe's gone.

19:41.052 --> 19:43.636
Wait, so she told you
we were over before telling me.

19:43.688 --> 19:45.137
I'm sorry you had
to find out that way,

19:45.189 --> 19:46.522
all right, buddy.

19:46.557 --> 19:48.808
And, boof,
judging by your stench,

19:48.810 --> 19:50.309
you were planning
on seeing her tonight.

19:50.361 --> 19:52.561
So, this has got to be tough.

19:52.613 --> 19:54.146
Shag time. Let's go.

19:54.148 --> 19:55.614
All right, it's Shag time,
Doug. I'm sorry, man.

19:55.650 --> 19:56.982
Well... you know what,
I'm just going to call her.

19:56.984 --> 19:58.701
Just to be sure.
Yeah, you should call her.

19:58.736 --> 20:00.069
That's actually a good idea.

20:00.121 --> 20:02.321
Oh, my God, you're serious.

20:02.323 --> 20:03.489
I don't un-understand.
Things were going so well.

20:03.541 --> 20:04.707
You're making a scene. Calm down.
I'm not.

20:04.742 --> 20:05.991
You are making a scene.
Hold on,

20:05.993 --> 20:08.073
can't we just talk about it, please?
Doug, it's over.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.050
Everybody's
in the conference room.

20:17.305 --> 20:19.004
(sighs)

20:19.056 --> 20:21.423
Hey, Jeannie, do me a favor.

20:21.476 --> 20:24.426
Tell me something to make me
feel good about this.

20:24.479 --> 20:26.262
Even if we did try,

20:26.314 --> 20:28.180
we might not have won
their business.

20:28.182 --> 20:30.683
Come on, something real. Shit.

20:30.685 --> 20:35.187
If I had to work for this
backwards-thinking asshole,

20:35.239 --> 20:37.573
I would never stop
bitching about it.

20:37.608 --> 20:39.692
See? There you go.

20:42.330 --> 20:44.697
(sighs)

20:44.749 --> 20:47.867
DOUG:
<i>Mr. Sullivan,</i>

20:47.919 --> 20:50.703
I think you can see here that
by pursuing a modest build up

20:50.705 --> 20:52.788
in states where Shags
already has an established

20:52.840 --> 20:54.840
brand presence, we can
confidently project

20:54.876 --> 20:57.927
an overall regional sales
growth of about...

20:57.962 --> 20:59.929
4.8 percent.
Oh, come on!

20:59.964 --> 21:02.097
And...
I-I'm sorry,

21:02.133 --> 21:05.885
but I've got to say,
this is... disappointing.

21:05.937 --> 21:09.221
A status quo strategy?

21:09.273 --> 21:12.391
I was expecting more
from the great Marty Kaan.

21:12.443 --> 21:13.893
So unless there's
anything else...

21:14.946 --> 21:17.229
Clyde...

21:18.816 --> 21:22.902
Um... can you pull up
the median real estate

21:22.954 --> 21:25.237
price differentials
for red states versus blue.

21:25.239 --> 21:27.489
One moment, Mr. Sullivan.
CLYDE: I'm on it.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.075
I can make... You sure?
All right. It's okay, it's fine.

21:29.195 --> 21:30.291
No, it's fine.

21:30.411 --> 21:31.961
Uh... Mr. Sullivan,

21:31.996 --> 21:33.629
we like to be thorough.

21:33.664 --> 21:36.916
We like to present our clients
with all of their options, but...

21:36.918 --> 21:39.835
yes, I'm afraid
we've been wasting your time.

21:39.887 --> 21:43.005
Because contrary to everything
you've been hearing today,

21:43.057 --> 21:47.927
Shags Burger Shack is ready to
compete on the national level.

21:47.929 --> 21:49.762
You know this,

21:49.814 --> 21:52.264
we all know this,
but with expansion

21:52.316 --> 21:53.766
comes more scrutiny.

21:53.768 --> 21:55.601
More people to answer to.

21:55.603 --> 21:57.353
And do you know what those
people will be telling you?

21:57.405 --> 21:59.438
Keep...

21:59.490 --> 22:02.324
your controversial mouth shut.

22:04.528 --> 22:05.828
Do you want to keep
your mouth shut?

22:05.863 --> 22:07.196
No, I do not.

22:07.248 --> 22:08.581
I didn't think so.

22:08.616 --> 22:09.832
And you don't have to.

22:09.867 --> 22:12.835
Because there is a way
for you to be who you are,

22:12.870 --> 22:14.370
without sacrificing
your bottom line.

22:14.422 --> 22:16.338
Take a look at Jeannie.

22:16.374 --> 22:17.790
Hello.

22:17.792 --> 22:19.041
(chuckles)

22:19.093 --> 22:20.626
About to experience

22:20.678 --> 22:21.961
the miracle of childbirth.

22:21.963 --> 22:23.212
And when Jeannie

22:23.264 --> 22:25.347
gets those midnight cravings,

22:25.383 --> 22:26.548
where does Jeannie send
her husband?

22:26.601 --> 22:28.550
Shags Burger Shack.

22:28.603 --> 22:30.352
Uh... Shags Burger Shack.

22:30.388 --> 22:31.637
Because not only does
she want a product

22:31.639 --> 22:33.022
that's quality,

22:33.057 --> 22:36.191
with the freshest ingredients,

22:36.227 --> 22:37.559
she likes what you stand for.

22:37.612 --> 22:39.945
So does my father,

22:39.981 --> 22:41.230
the Pastor Jeremiah Kaan.

22:41.282 --> 22:42.698
And so do I.

22:42.733 --> 22:45.317
Because it is these same values

22:45.369 --> 22:47.236
that this born-again father

22:47.288 --> 22:50.155
fights to instill
in his son every day.

22:50.157 --> 22:52.491
Well, I'm happy to hear
you've been saved,

22:52.493 --> 22:54.376
but what does this have to do

22:54.412 --> 22:55.711
with our expansion?

22:55.746 --> 22:58.831
Well, we feel that by
focusing your build out

22:58.833 --> 23:01.216
in areas where the majority
of the population,

23:01.252 --> 23:02.835
you know,
supports our shared views...

23:02.837 --> 23:05.337
Which is a vast majority
of the country.

23:05.339 --> 23:08.340
MARTY: ...you will more than
offset any diminished earnings

23:08.342 --> 23:09.808
from the blue markets.

23:09.844 --> 23:12.177
Listen, you keep speaking
to truth,

23:12.229 --> 23:14.430
and people will flock
to eat at Shags Burger Shack

23:14.482 --> 23:17.099
because in so doing,
they're making a statement.

23:17.151 --> 23:18.517
A statement that says,

23:18.569 --> 23:19.852
I stand for values.

23:19.904 --> 23:21.103
I stand for family.

23:21.155 --> 23:22.604
For God.

23:22.657 --> 23:24.690
MARTY:
Amen.

23:24.742 --> 23:26.909
Hallelujah, I stand for God.

23:26.944 --> 23:28.911
And an added bonus...

23:28.946 --> 23:32.448
the median real estate prices
in red states versus blue states

23:32.500 --> 23:34.583
are lower by an average...

23:34.618 --> 23:36.118
8.7 percent.

23:36.170 --> 23:39.371
There you go-- lower overhead,
bigger profits.

23:39.373 --> 23:41.457
And do you think we could
still compete with the majors?

23:41.509 --> 23:42.541
MARTY:
Competing?

23:42.543 --> 23:44.626
They're going to be Mic-shitting
in their pants.

23:44.679 --> 23:46.712
(shocked murmuring)
(laughs): Okay, no, no.

23:46.764 --> 23:48.213
(laughs): Sorry, no, I got excited.
Oh-ho.

23:48.265 --> 23:49.798
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, no, no, no, no.

23:49.850 --> 23:50.933
It's fine.
Listen,

23:50.968 --> 23:52.968
you say whatever you want,
whenever you want.

23:53.020 --> 23:55.220
And after you've devoured
the heartland,

23:55.272 --> 23:57.940
after you've become
so unstoppably huge

23:57.975 --> 23:59.141
that you are undeniable,

23:59.193 --> 24:01.860
you march into those
liberal markets

24:01.896 --> 24:03.729
like a conquering hero.

24:03.781 --> 24:05.147
Do you like what you're hearing
so far?

24:05.199 --> 24:06.398
Very much.

24:07.651 --> 24:09.735
You told me this was
a real Miu Miu.

24:09.737 --> 24:12.905
I wore this fake piece of shit
to a charity event.

24:12.907 --> 24:14.867
Did you really give
Deep Throat Debbie a discount?

24:15.576 --> 24:17.743
Enjoy your expulsion, asshole.

24:22.666 --> 24:25.467
Hey. Molly.

24:25.503 --> 24:27.669
What's up guys?

24:27.722 --> 24:29.755
Is everyone still going
to Avery's later?

24:29.757 --> 24:31.640
Um, I don't think so.

24:31.675 --> 24:33.642
We're all pretty tired.

24:37.148 --> 24:40.599
Closed it in
the motherfucking room!

24:40.651 --> 24:42.818
Uh-huh. Boom...
round the room.

24:42.853 --> 24:44.019
Ah!
Ah!

24:44.071 --> 24:45.938
Some masterful shit
in there, Marty.

24:45.940 --> 24:49.108
I like to think of myself
as merely a vessel

24:49.110 --> 24:50.359
for a higher power.
Amen.

24:50.411 --> 24:52.661
It's like my father
used to say...

24:52.696 --> 24:54.446
The great Pastor Jeremiah Kaan.
The very good pastor,

24:54.448 --> 24:56.865
he would say, "Son,"
he liked to call me son.

24:56.917 --> 24:58.450
He'd say, "Son,

24:58.452 --> 25:03.288
get yourself
motherfucking paid,"

25:03.340 --> 25:05.007
and they we'd go, rah, rah,
Rah, rah.

25:05.042 --> 25:06.959
rah, rah!
Praise money!

25:07.011 --> 25:08.377
Hallowed be thy name.

25:08.429 --> 25:09.545
Whoo, hallelujah!

25:09.597 --> 25:11.180
As much as I hate to break up
this revival meeting,

25:11.215 --> 25:12.548
but I did promise the hubby

25:12.600 --> 25:13.966
we'd go imaginary
house hunting, so...

25:14.018 --> 25:15.517
Oh, well,

25:15.553 --> 25:19.138
I hear the real estate prices in
Randland are at an all-time low.

25:20.191 --> 25:22.024
Randland.

25:22.059 --> 25:23.642
The, uh, the mythical land

25:23.694 --> 25:24.893
in the <i> Wheel of Time</i> series,
written by...

25:24.945 --> 25:26.478
Oh, why do I bother?

25:26.530 --> 25:28.397
Gee, how bad do you think this
fallout with Denna is gonna be?

25:28.449 --> 25:29.648
Oh, don't worry about that.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.150
We'll-we'll figure it out.

25:31.202 --> 25:33.152
Marty, Luke Sullivan
for you on one.

25:33.204 --> 25:35.954
Ah... probably calling to say
thank you very much.

25:35.990 --> 25:37.456
(Jeannie chuckles)
CLYDE: Oh.

25:40.828 --> 25:42.161
Yes, sir.

25:42.213 --> 25:44.079
Mr. Sullivan.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.082
No, I-I'm sorry, could you...

25:48.135 --> 25:50.586
I don't understand.

25:50.638 --> 25:53.005
No, we do share a comm...

25:53.057 --> 25:54.890
Mist...

25:57.511 --> 25:59.344
Uh... (sighs)

25:59.346 --> 26:01.096
apparently they've had
a change of heart.

26:01.148 --> 26:02.681
They've decided to go
with a firm

26:02.733 --> 26:05.851
whose true core values
are more in line with theirs.

26:05.903 --> 26:07.569
True core values?

26:07.605 --> 26:10.239
How did they switch so...

26:18.866 --> 26:20.332
DENNA:
Hey.

26:20.367 --> 26:21.783
How'd it go with Shags?

26:21.836 --> 26:23.285
Great.

26:23.337 --> 26:24.703
Till you killed the deal.

26:24.705 --> 26:29.091
Now why does everyone just
assume I'm this all-powerful,

26:29.126 --> 26:31.927
omnipotent deity who can
eviscerate major deals

26:31.962 --> 26:33.962
the moment they happen?

26:35.382 --> 26:37.432
Okay, you got me.

26:37.468 --> 26:38.934
(chuckles):
I did enjoy

26:38.969 --> 26:41.603
hearing about Jeannie's husband
and your pastor father.

26:41.639 --> 26:44.306
But Luke was shocked to learn
that a religious man

26:44.358 --> 26:48.360
such as yourself would not only
have a baby out of wedlock,

26:48.395 --> 26:50.395
but a gender bending son.

26:50.397 --> 26:52.281
You involved my son in this?

26:53.367 --> 26:54.950
So, that's it?

26:54.985 --> 26:58.070
I don't even get the courtesy
of a bullshit excuse?

26:58.122 --> 26:59.371
I mean, you know,

26:59.406 --> 27:00.906
"I didn't realize what
you were asking me to do.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.574
I was confused."
Oh, you weren't subtle.

27:02.626 --> 27:04.293
You know what's really
disappointing here?

27:04.328 --> 27:06.495
What?
I thought we were having fun.

27:06.547 --> 27:08.580
You got to play
king of the mountain,

27:08.632 --> 27:10.992
it didn't cost me anything,
so I was happy to let you do it.

27:11.001 --> 27:13.635
But somewhere along the way,
you convinced yourself

27:13.671 --> 27:15.087
that you had real power.

27:15.089 --> 27:18.423
And now you're a problem
I have to solve.

27:18.425 --> 27:21.343
(phone buzzing)

27:21.395 --> 27:24.012
(clears throat)

27:24.064 --> 27:26.348
This is important,
so if there's nothing else?

27:26.400 --> 27:28.016
(phone continues buzzing)

27:29.120 --> 27:30.486
Hi.

27:30.488 --> 27:33.489
No, now's a perfect time
to talk.

27:35.710 --> 27:39.295
