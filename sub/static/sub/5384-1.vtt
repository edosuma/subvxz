00:34.965 --> 00:37.399
Please, get me to a hospital!

00:39.769 --> 00:41.361
I can't breathe.

01:44.134 --> 01:47.103
You know what? If you were smart,
you would stop talking right now.

01:47.203 --> 01:50.639
Sue me. I just know that women
should never work for women.

01:50.740 --> 01:51.832
How can you say that?

01:51.941 --> 01:54.068
Because they're always threatened.

01:54.177 --> 01:56.338
Especially if you're beautiful,
and they're not.

01:56.446 --> 01:58.073
Fine! You never had a fight with your boss?

01:58.181 --> 01:59.307
Never. You know why?

02:00.283 --> 02:01.944
Because he's a man.

02:02.052 --> 02:03.610
Can we please drop this?

02:03.753 --> 02:06.620
I just want to go home and kiss my son.
Honey.

02:06.723 --> 02:09.782
See, you have to mention
that you have a child and we don't.

02:09.893 --> 02:12.623
- There's my point.
- Erit, I didn't say anything of the sort.

02:12.729 --> 02:15.129
Don't apologize, it's genetics.

02:15.231 --> 02:17.256
Women are always competing
with each other.

02:17.367 --> 02:19.130
That's why you're having problems
with your boss.

02:19.235 --> 02:21.430
- Because she's a woman.
- Exactly.

02:21.538 --> 02:24.632
Women should work under men,
men under women. That's it.

02:25.041 --> 02:26.030
What about men under men?

02:26.409 --> 02:28.274
That's fine, too.
I mean, they can deal with it.

02:29.212 --> 02:31.146
- Can we go now?
- Either of you guys want another drink?

02:31.247 --> 02:32.305
- We're good.
- Shot? Double?

02:32.415 --> 02:35.282
Women can do amazing things.
I am one. I know.

02:35.385 --> 02:36.875
But even I would never work for me.

02:36.986 --> 02:38.783
That we can agree on. Good night, Mick.

02:38.888 --> 02:40.515
We are in a bad mood.

02:40.623 --> 02:43.990
She's got a point, bro, you know.
I'd much rather work under you than her.

02:44.761 --> 02:48.094
That's nice. I'd rather work under him, too.

02:49.599 --> 02:51.123
You'd rather "work" under John?

02:51.835 --> 02:53.530
You have a problem with that, too?

02:53.636 --> 02:56.400
No! Why would I have a problem
with your little sexual innuendo?

02:56.506 --> 02:57.632
What is up your ass tonight?

02:58.141 --> 03:01.702
So I should just sit here while you come on
to my husband right in front of me?

03:01.811 --> 03:05.645
Lara, if I wanted your husband,
I would have him, like that.

03:05.748 --> 03:07.943
How? You couldn't possibly show him
more of those tits.

03:08.051 --> 03:09.678
- You know what your problem is?
- Okay...

03:09.786 --> 03:12.016
My problem is your brain
is as big as those tits.

03:12.122 --> 03:13.487
- Baby, this is your fault!
- Huge, exactly!

03:13.590 --> 03:14.557
This is your...

03:14.657 --> 03:16.750
If you had half a brain,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.589
Baby. Let it go, let it go, let it go.

03:18.928 --> 03:21.453
- Good night, brother dear!
- Good night!

03:21.564 --> 03:24.294
- She's completely full of herself.
- Don't try and agree with me now!

03:24.400 --> 03:26.129
I don't even think
she's a member of the dental profession.

03:26.236 --> 03:27.498
Shut up!

03:27.604 --> 03:30.471
She probably can't even
spell "anesthesiologist."

03:30.573 --> 03:33.804
- The woman's a complete fraud.
- We went to her office party, you idiot!

03:33.910 --> 03:36.140
And I believe she hit on me
that night as well.

03:36.246 --> 03:39.807
You are completely delusional. She didn't
even hit on you in there. I just don't like her.

03:39.916 --> 03:43.283
I understand your point of view. I really do.
I agree with you.

03:43.386 --> 03:47.049
Somebody who looks like that should not
be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.

03:47.157 --> 03:49.057
You are an asshole!

03:49.359 --> 03:52.692
You're sitting in the chair,
you're trying to stay calm,

03:52.795 --> 03:55.889
and you got them things
hanging in your face...

04:25.795 --> 04:28.958
- So, see you next weekend. All right?
- Okay.

04:29.065 --> 04:31.090
- Thank you.
- Good night.

04:31.201 --> 04:32.566
- Bye.
- Bye!

04:32.669 --> 04:33.795
Bye!

04:37.373 --> 04:38.670
Oh, gee.

04:51.221 --> 04:52.210
Look at this,

04:54.190 --> 04:56.556
- Now you say go.
- Go!

04:58.328 --> 04:59.352
Smash.

04:59.462 --> 05:01.089
All right, squeeze in.

05:01.197 --> 05:03.597
You know, you can't do this every morning.
It's way too corny.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.327
Come on. Smile.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.428
It's just till he's 18.

05:10.006 --> 05:13.567
- A present.
- Oh, great. What's that?

05:13.676 --> 05:17.077
You hate brushing your teeth
and that brushes them in 30 seconds.

05:17.180 --> 05:20.308
I love brushing my teeth.
Don't believe everything your mother says.

05:20.416 --> 05:22.941
- What time's your last class?
- 3:00.

05:23.052 --> 05:25.247
But I got some papers to grade.
Can you pick up Luke?

05:25.355 --> 05:28.756
After yesterday,
I probably don't have a job anyway, so...

05:28.858 --> 05:31.053
Was it wrong of me
to call her a useless cow?

05:32.161 --> 05:35.392
I think bosses admire
that kind of frank exchange.

05:35.698 --> 05:37.893
- Did you call your dad?
- When?

05:38.735 --> 05:40.566
Birthday, yesterday!

05:40.670 --> 05:44.037
Yeah, I sent him some freshly cut flowers,
little pink roses.

05:44.140 --> 05:45.732
I sent him a handmade card.

05:45.842 --> 05:48.743
And I finished that quilt I've been sewing
since spring.

05:48.845 --> 05:50.870
You are completely impossible.

05:50.980 --> 05:54.347
Did you notice what I got for my birthday
this year? I got a grunt.

05:54.450 --> 05:57.681
Mom said, "Happy birthday, sweetheart,"
and Dad went...

05:57.787 --> 06:00.312
It was just... It was a beautiful moment
in my life. I teared up.

06:00.657 --> 06:04.218
Ever think that somebody has to be
the bigger person here?

06:04.327 --> 06:06.818
Now I want you to remember this
for the custody hearing,

06:06.929 --> 06:08.988
how Mommy is always
scolding Daddy, okay?

06:09.098 --> 06:10.156
Can you remember that?

06:10.266 --> 06:11.528
You know, how are you gonna feel

06:11.634 --> 06:14.034
when Luke grows up
and doesn't call you on your birthday?

06:14.137 --> 06:16.002
And now she's trying to drive a wedge
between us.

06:16.105 --> 06:18.972
- I give up.
- And now she's abandoning you.

06:22.745 --> 06:26.272
Hey, buddy, do you wanna try
and knock him over again?

06:27.350 --> 06:29.750
You ready? Line it up.

06:31.821 --> 06:34.722
- Line it up now and you say go.
- Go!

06:36.659 --> 06:37.956
I got it.

06:41.297 --> 06:43.697
Pittsburgh Police.
This is an arrest warrant for Lara Brennan...

06:43.800 --> 06:45.859
- Arrest for what?
- ...and a search warrant for the premises.

06:45.968 --> 06:47.060
- Hold on!
- Lara Brennan?

06:47.170 --> 06:50.230
- You touch me again, I'm gonna arrest you.
- Hold on.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.705
- Stay where you are!
- This is my house!

06:51.808 --> 06:52.866
- Lara Brennan?
- Yes!

06:52.975 --> 06:53.942
I will arrest you.

06:54.043 --> 06:55.840
You're under arrest for the murder
of Elizabeth Gesas.

06:55.945 --> 06:57.412
- Calm down!
- I got my kid in the kitchen!

06:57.513 --> 06:58.980
What are you doing?
Arrest her for what?

06:59.082 --> 07:01.016
- Turn around!
- Mommy!

07:01.117 --> 07:02.516
- John! John!
- You have the right to an attorney...

07:02.618 --> 07:04.051
Go get Luke. Go get Luke.

07:04.153 --> 07:05.120
- ...understand these rights...
- Luke!

07:05.221 --> 07:06.779
It's okay, buddy! It's okay!

07:07.757 --> 07:09.019
- Mommy!
- Luke!

07:10.293 --> 07:12.386
It's all right. It's okay!

07:21.704 --> 07:23.672
Daddy! Daddy!

07:26.676 --> 07:28.871
- Daddy!
- What's wrong? What's wrong, buddy?

07:28.978 --> 07:29.945
What's wrong?

07:33.015 --> 07:34.448
I got you.

07:41.190 --> 07:44.250
Well, you can stay in here

07:45.361 --> 07:51.231
as long as you sleep on this side of the bed,
all right?

07:55.805 --> 07:56.772
You little snake.

07:57.974 --> 08:01.933
I don't know why I keep falling
for the same old trick.

08:02.979 --> 08:05.345
You have your tricks, don't you?

08:07.016 --> 08:09.541
Hey, go to sleep.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.415
Go to sleep.

08:27.703 --> 08:30.934
- But Sam is your friend, right?
- Not at lunch.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.971
- Why, does he steal your food?
- No.

08:37.246 --> 08:40.807
- Did he say something mean? About Mom?
- Yeah.

08:43.586 --> 08:45.486
- Did you hit him?
- Yeah.

08:45.588 --> 08:47.988
Good. Where'd you hit him?

08:49.091 --> 08:50.786
On the playground.

08:52.028 --> 08:54.189
Wow! That must have hurt.

08:58.334 --> 08:59.323
Hold it there, son.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.106
It's a toy.

09:13.483 --> 09:14.848
Thank you.

09:15.418 --> 09:18.114
Hey. All right.

09:19.222 --> 09:21.190
And the other arm.

09:21.691 --> 09:25.286
Don't worry about the car.
We'll get it back later, okay?

09:42.912 --> 09:44.038
Hey!

09:58.127 --> 09:59.560
Hi, honey!

10:00.596 --> 10:01.722
Hey.

10:03.699 --> 10:05.929
You won't give Mommy a kiss?

10:07.203 --> 10:08.568
Can Mommy please have a kiss?

10:08.671 --> 10:10.969
Rat-bag. Give your mom a kiss.

10:13.476 --> 10:17.105
- Is Daddy reading you my letters?
- Every night at bedtime.

10:17.213 --> 10:18.373
Yeah?

10:22.585 --> 10:23.984
You smell so good.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.918
What are you gonna build today?

10:28.791 --> 10:30.816
You gonna build a fort?

10:33.829 --> 10:36.263
A door? Or a castle?

10:41.337 --> 10:42.429
Hey.

10:52.582 --> 10:53.947
Was he scared going to school?

10:54.050 --> 10:57.451
No. I walked him to his class,
gave him a kiss, he just walked right in.

10:57.553 --> 11:00.078
Didn't even turn back for a wave.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.795
Look at his friends!

11:15.871 --> 11:17.463
And his desk.

11:22.378 --> 11:24.471
- How was your first day?
- Excellent.

11:24.947 --> 11:27.814
Half the class stayed awake, you know.

11:27.917 --> 11:30.750
- I talked to your mom.
- When is she coming?

11:33.255 --> 11:37.248
She's having a lot of trouble
with her business, so...

11:39.195 --> 11:43.291
Well, it's only been a couple of years,
I'm sure she'll get around to it.

11:46.235 --> 11:48.203
Have you heard anything?

11:48.704 --> 11:50.171
About the appeal?

11:50.272 --> 11:53.241
Yeah, and I've just decided not to tell you.

11:53.809 --> 11:55.800
- Remember what Meyer said.
- Don't.

11:55.911 --> 11:58.937
It can take months for a court
to make a ruling.

11:59.048 --> 12:03.109
I saw that woman. She was there.
She couldn't have just disappeared.

12:03.219 --> 12:04.686
Meyer is looking for a new investigator.

12:04.787 --> 12:07.722
Her coat snagged my purse,
and I felt that button pop,

12:07.823 --> 12:09.347
and they're blind if they can't find it.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.427
He's gonna go through
all the evidence again.

12:13.362 --> 12:16.525
That's great,
because we're not quite bankrupt yet.

12:16.632 --> 12:18.190
We're fine.

12:19.068 --> 12:21.195
How you just lie and lie.

12:23.506 --> 12:25.440
But you're so handsome.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.975
Can you do me a favor?

12:33.082 --> 12:34.208
I don't know, I'm kind of busy.

12:34.483 --> 12:35.814
I need you to run for governor.

12:35.918 --> 12:37.146
I can do that.

12:37.253 --> 12:40.484
You can change this rule
about no conjugal visits,

12:41.023 --> 12:43.685
'cause I don't think
I can last another 20 years.

12:45.061 --> 12:46.050
Hey.

12:52.468 --> 12:53.730
I'm okay.

12:54.870 --> 12:57.805
- I'm okay.
- Everything is gonna be all right.

12:58.641 --> 13:00.165
I promise.

13:07.149 --> 13:09.777
You think he'll ever kiss me again?

13:26.102 --> 13:27.763
I need you to stand up.

13:40.783 --> 13:42.273
Tag, you're it.

13:48.991 --> 13:50.049
Tag, you're it.

13:53.562 --> 13:56.122
Luke! Let's go, yard ape.

13:59.301 --> 14:00.427
Hey.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.760
- Have fun?
- Yeah.

14:02.872 --> 14:04.840
She's kind of crazy, that little girl, right?

14:08.210 --> 14:09.199
Time to go, Carrie!

14:10.713 --> 14:11.805
No!

15:43.606 --> 15:47.906
He didn't even read the thing. Half the time,
I'm telling you... We'll get him in there.

16:04.126 --> 16:07.186
What happens if we find the woman
who was leaving the parking lot?

16:08.030 --> 16:10.157
The PCRA has been rejected.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.926
No new evidence can be submitted.
Not anymore.

16:13.035 --> 16:14.059
It was a robbery.

16:14.169 --> 16:17.195
And if they had used her credit card,
we could have argued that.

16:17.306 --> 16:18.967
I'm... I'm sorry.

16:19.942 --> 16:21.239
John...

16:23.178 --> 16:24.668
This sucks.

16:25.648 --> 16:28.173
Okay. That's that.

16:30.686 --> 16:33.621
All we have now
is the Supreme Court, right?

16:36.325 --> 16:37.519
John, in the last 30 years,

16:37.626 --> 16:40.094
the Supreme Court
has not heard one murder case.

16:41.664 --> 16:44.224
No decent lawyer
would even file the pleadings.

16:47.870 --> 16:52.603
So, all I have to do is find an indecent one?
That shouldn't be too hard.

16:55.744 --> 16:57.336
I'll file it.

16:58.781 --> 17:01.875
But I need you to do something for me.

17:02.584 --> 17:03.778
What?

17:04.252 --> 17:09.213
I need you to look at the evidence
and forget that Lara's your wife.

17:11.527 --> 17:12.858
I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

17:12.962 --> 17:17.160
I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty,
I'm just saying look at it.

17:18.767 --> 17:21.531
Her co-worker sees her leaving the scene,

17:21.637 --> 17:25.698
the victim's blood is on her clothes,
her fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

17:25.808 --> 17:26.832
And then we went out to dinner.

17:27.443 --> 17:29.809
How do you do that
if you just killed somebody?

17:29.912 --> 17:31.004
That would make her a psychopath.

17:31.113 --> 17:32.910
- And the fight...
- Is Lara a psychopath?

17:33.015 --> 17:35.142
- The fight in the office?
- Everyone fights with their boss!

17:35.250 --> 17:37.343
But this one ended up dead.

17:38.087 --> 17:41.921
So what you're saying is that
you never believed in her innocence?

17:42.024 --> 17:43.855
- How can you say that?
- What are you saying, Meyer?

17:43.959 --> 17:46.985
I'm saying that it no longer matters
what we believe,

17:47.096 --> 17:49.428
Lara is not getting out!

17:56.505 --> 17:59.668
And you have no idea
how much I hate to say that.

18:03.645 --> 18:06.637
I will find someone to file the pleadings.

18:06.749 --> 18:07.716
John.

18:08.117 --> 18:10.108
John, come on. John!

18:10.486 --> 18:11.646
John!

18:12.688 --> 18:14.747
John! For Christ's sakes!

19:48.016 --> 19:48.983
Come on.

19:49.451 --> 19:51.112
We'll find Scout, okay?

20:08.637 --> 20:10.070
Thank you.

20:25.154 --> 20:31.821
"And give a big hug to Pengui,
Little Pengui, Kiki and Opossumy.

20:32.161 --> 20:34.755
"Lots and lots of love, Mommy."

20:35.697 --> 20:36.994
Should we write her back?

20:40.068 --> 20:41.126
Can I have a quarter?

20:42.137 --> 20:44.264
Can you have a quarter?

20:46.742 --> 20:49.870
Yeah, but you know you can't spend these.

20:50.979 --> 20:53.504
Because they come from the cottage
where Mom and I used to take you

20:53.615 --> 20:55.412
when you were a baby.

20:55.918 --> 20:57.977
Then can I have them all?

20:59.188 --> 21:00.348
Sure.

21:22.811 --> 21:25.405
My wife, Lara Brennan,
she was sent up here.

21:25.514 --> 21:28.972
- Brennan, B-R-E-N-N-A-N.
- I'm sorry, but she can't have visitors.

21:29.084 --> 21:30.346
That's ridiculous. I have to see her.

21:30.452 --> 21:31.885
- Lara! Lara!
- I'm sorry.

21:31.987 --> 21:32.954
You can't go down there!

21:33.922 --> 21:35.856
- You can't be in here!
- Hey, hey, stop. Stop right there.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.255
- Where you going? Hey, come back here.
- Lara!

21:37.359 --> 21:38.849
- Lara!
- Sir!

21:38.961 --> 21:40.656
- What the hell is going on?
- My wife attempted suicide.

21:40.762 --> 21:42.195
They brought her up here.
I have to see her, please.

21:42.297 --> 21:44.162
- She's not allowed visitors.
- So why isn't she in the ER?

21:44.266 --> 21:47.167
- Because she's a transfer from County Jail.
- Just two minutes, please.

21:49.004 --> 21:50.596
Two minutes.

21:53.909 --> 21:55.103
Okay.

21:56.979 --> 21:57.946
Thank you.

22:05.754 --> 22:07.221
Two minutes.

22:46.295 --> 22:48.923
So, The Life and Times of Don Quixote.

22:49.998 --> 22:51.829
What is it about?

22:51.933 --> 22:56.597
That someone's belief in virtue
is more important than virtue itself?

22:57.606 --> 23:01.007
Yes, that's in there, But what is it about?

23:03.278 --> 23:08.272
Could it be about
how rational thought destroys your soul?

23:10.986 --> 23:14.649
Could it be about the triumph of irrationality
and the power that's in that?

23:15.590 --> 23:18.650
You know, we spend a lot of time
trying to organize the world.

23:18.760 --> 23:22.753
We build clocks and calendars
and we try and predict the weather,

23:25.067 --> 23:29.367
But what part of our life
is truly under our control?

23:44.486 --> 23:48.820
What if we choose to exist purely
in a reality of our own making?

23:52.294 --> 23:53.818
Does that render us insane?

24:01.069 --> 24:03.833
And if it does,
isn't that better than a life of despair?

24:14.416 --> 24:19.183
It's a course that investigates what
drives men to be free, no matter the cost.

24:20.455 --> 24:23.253
Some other teacher had dibs on Papillon?

24:24.726 --> 24:28.218
You escaped from jail seven times.

24:29.464 --> 24:31.261
What do you want to know?

24:31.366 --> 24:33.800
How you escaped when no one else could.

24:33.902 --> 24:36.097
Balls and a little luck.

24:36.905 --> 24:38.429
No prison in the world is airtight.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.202
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

24:41.443 --> 24:42.808
How do you do that?

24:44.012 --> 24:45.070
A lot of looking.

24:45.981 --> 24:48.449
Especially at things
that break up the daily routine.

24:49.151 --> 24:52.484
Guards get comfortable
doing the same thing day in, day out.

24:52.587 --> 24:55.181
Something happens,
that's when they make mistakes.

24:55.290 --> 24:58.088
When you see it, you have to be ready.

24:58.193 --> 25:00.627
You have to have the entire plan
already in place,

25:00.729 --> 25:03.596
even before you know
how you're going to get out of jail.

25:03.698 --> 25:06.792
Escaping is easy,
the hardest part is staying free.

25:07.702 --> 25:11.729
You have to know where you're gonna go
and how you're gonna get there.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.606
You have to know how they plan
to catch you, where and when.

25:16.311 --> 25:18.541
Well, how the hell
are you supposed to know that?

25:18.647 --> 25:20.706
You pay off someone who knows.

25:20.816 --> 25:23.580
And a lot depends on
if the prison is in the country or the city.

25:23.685 --> 25:24.743
City.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.257
Where are you from?

25:39.401 --> 25:40.766
Pittsburgh.

25:44.739 --> 25:45.933
Pittsburgh's tough.

25:46.908 --> 25:50.002
So many bridges and tunnels
they can block off,

25:50.812 --> 25:52.473
From the time they make the call,

25:52.581 --> 25:56.574
the police can have the center of the city
sealed tight in 15 minutes,

25:56.685 --> 25:58.152
How can they be so exact?

25:58.253 --> 26:01.689
After 9/11, Homeland Security
made every city have a lockdown plan.

26:02.290 --> 26:06.283
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston,
Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

26:06.728 --> 26:08.593
They can do D.C. in under 10.

26:08.697 --> 26:12.793
Within 35 minutes, they can have cops
at every tollbooth on the interstate

26:12.901 --> 26:15.665
and be running rolling stops
on the secondary roads,

26:15.770 --> 26:18.398
They won't have your photograph yet,
but they will have your description,

26:19.808 --> 26:22.504
What if you can't get out?
Thirty-five minutes is not a lot of time.

26:22.611 --> 26:23.600
Then surrender.

26:23.712 --> 26:28.149
Because they will shoot you on sight,
along with anyone else you're with.

26:28.783 --> 26:31.115
Stay far away
from the train and bus stations.

26:31.253 --> 26:33.915
Forget the local airports,
Leave from another state,

26:34.756 --> 26:37.816
Second, identity.
It's easy to find fake papers,

26:37.926 --> 26:40.656
harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport.

26:40.762 --> 26:45.199
You'll need a passport, a driver's license
and a social security number.

26:45.300 --> 26:48.701
If you have to rent a car,
find a place that will take a cash deposit.

26:48.937 --> 26:53.169
They'll still run a credit check,
so use a real person's name on the ID.

26:53.275 --> 26:54.902
Third, destination.

26:55.010 --> 26:57.069
You want somewhere
that doesn't attract American tourists,

26:58.280 --> 27:00.771
Think Yemen, and you get the idea.

27:01.249 --> 27:04.047
And money, you'll need a truckload of it.

27:04.152 --> 27:07.610
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

27:08.456 --> 27:09.480
How much?

27:09.591 --> 27:11.821
Enough to last at least five, six years,

27:12.193 --> 27:15.060
You run out of money,
you run out of friends.

27:17.132 --> 27:23.093
But before you do anything,
you have to ask yourself if you can do it.

27:23.538 --> 27:26.234
Can you forget about ever seeing
your parents again?

27:26.341 --> 27:30.072
Can you kill a guard?
Leave your kid at a gas station?

27:30.478 --> 27:32.412
Push some nice old lady to the ground

27:32.514 --> 27:34.539
just because she gets
between you and the door?

27:34.649 --> 27:38.278
Because to do this thing,
that's who you have to become.

27:39.955 --> 27:42.219
And if you can't, don't start,

27:43.425 --> 27:46.189
'cause you'll just get someone killed.

27:47.095 --> 27:49.029
How did you get caught?

27:52.300 --> 27:53.995
I gave myself up.

27:55.503 --> 28:00.304
I couldn't take wondering when someone
was gonna come through the bedroom door.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.474
So, what do you have in your pocket?

28:22.931 --> 28:24.023
Good luck.

29:31.132 --> 29:32.622
No prison in the world is airtight,

29:32.734 --> 29:35.032
Each one has a key, You just have to find it,

29:36.171 --> 29:37.798
How do you do that?

29:37.906 --> 29:39.134
A lot of looking,

29:39.240 --> 29:42.038
Especially at things
that break up the daily routine,

29:53.888 --> 29:57.688
And on the left, the Allegheny County Jail,
now the largest jail in the world,

29:57.792 --> 30:01.023
There have been three escape attempts
of which no one has made it out alive,

30:01.129 --> 30:03.120
If you look to the right, south side...

30:05.633 --> 30:09.797
"On the first landing, which was as small
as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed,

30:09.904 --> 30:12.429
"there was a niche in the column,
about half a yard wide,

30:12.540 --> 30:15.998
"and in this niche, the prince felt
convinced that a man stood concealed.

30:16.111 --> 30:18.841
"He thought he could distinguish
a figure standing there..."

30:24.519 --> 30:27.682
25, 26, 27,

30:28.723 --> 30:30.588
28, 29, 30.

30:33.128 --> 30:34.095
Good?

30:35.864 --> 30:38.355
And money, you'll need a truckload of it,

30:38.867 --> 30:42.268
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information,

30:46.074 --> 30:48.269
It's gonna take our selection.

30:48.376 --> 30:50.674
Then we're gonna wanna use
our magic lasso tool

30:50.779 --> 30:52.679
to get the door out of the background.

31:01.055 --> 31:02.147
Hey.

31:13.568 --> 31:17.004
Identity, it's easy to find fake papers,

31:17.105 --> 31:20.506
harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport,

31:45.800 --> 31:48.234
- Oxycontin.
- $10 a piece.

31:49.204 --> 31:50.831
Give you five for $40.

32:00.748 --> 32:03.649
Hey, I need some passports.

32:04.319 --> 32:07.083
Piss off, man! Beat your feet.

32:14.262 --> 32:15.627
Okay, boy!

32:28.076 --> 32:31.102
You got to pay upfront for the passports, yo.

32:31.679 --> 32:34.477
- I can do that.
- You know the Hotel Lafayette?

32:35.583 --> 32:39.713
It's on Main Street. When you get there,
go to the bar, ask for Harv.

32:40.355 --> 32:41.447
What's your name?

32:41.789 --> 32:43.780
Tell him Mouss sent you.

33:00.008 --> 33:02.499
Harv? I'm looking for Harv.

33:17.692 --> 33:19.489
- Are you Harv?
- Yeah.

33:20.295 --> 33:22.729
Mouss told me to come and see you.

33:22.997 --> 33:24.658
He did, did he? What do you want?

33:27.035 --> 33:32.473
Three passports, a driver's license,
and a real social security number.

33:33.174 --> 33:35.108
How do you know Mouss?

33:35.977 --> 33:37.774
He babysits my kid.

33:40.048 --> 33:41.948
Okay, follow me.

33:56.698 --> 33:59.132
- You got the photos on you?
- Yeah.

34:00.301 --> 34:02.098
- How much?
- $1,500.

34:16.317 --> 34:19.911
If I ever see your face again,
you're gonna lose an eye.

34:56.157 --> 34:59.126
Yeah, it was stupid. I fell off the bike.

35:00.561 --> 35:03.359
You mean the bike that's been in our garage
for two years?

35:03.464 --> 35:05.295
Put your head back.

35:08.002 --> 35:10.436
Some guy made a crack about Lara.

35:10.872 --> 35:13.773
So that's what you do now? You punch
everybody who thinks she's guilty?

35:13.875 --> 35:15.365
What's that supposed to mean?

35:15.476 --> 35:17.740
It means it's important what you believe,

35:17.845 --> 35:19.335
- not what somebody else...
- Really?

35:19.447 --> 35:21.915
- Do you believe, Mom?
- Why are you trying to start a fight?

35:22.016 --> 35:23.608
Come on, buddy. Let's go. Where's his bag?

35:23.718 --> 35:25.879
- Why are you doing this?
- No reason.

35:25.987 --> 35:27.545
I just stupidly thought that the people
who loved her

35:27.655 --> 35:30.021
would actually believe she's innocent.
My mistake.

35:30.124 --> 35:31.148
Stop this!

35:36.697 --> 35:38.665
Go give Grandma a kiss.

35:42.403 --> 35:43.700
Come on.

36:11.099 --> 36:12.999
Does your face hurt?

36:14.702 --> 36:16.033
A little.

36:17.071 --> 36:18.971
Did you hit him back?

36:22.610 --> 36:24.168
No, I... I didn't.

36:24.879 --> 36:26.403
That's okay.

36:37.725 --> 36:38.714
Okay, buddy?

37:04.752 --> 37:08.188
I'm looking for someone
who does high-end IDs.

37:08.289 --> 37:10.416
Passports, social security cards.

37:10.525 --> 37:12.186
Get out of here.

37:52.833 --> 37:53.857
Yeah?

37:54.335 --> 37:58.294
I was at the bar.
I know what you are looking for.

38:02.443 --> 38:05.571
I'm deaf, you idiot. I read your lips.

38:18.693 --> 38:19.887
What do you need?

38:19.994 --> 38:23.259
Passports, driver's license,

38:24.432 --> 38:26.992
a social security number
that'll take a credit check.

38:29.337 --> 38:30.668
$3,700.

38:31.572 --> 38:32.937
That's too much.

38:33.274 --> 38:35.435
It is if you never get them.

38:38.379 --> 38:40.973
I need photos and $1,000 in advance.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.589
- I'll bring them Wednesday.
- Hey, not here.

38:57.331 --> 38:59.697
I don't want you coming back here again.

39:03.404 --> 39:08.239
Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
Under the bridge, 2:00.

39:09.143 --> 39:11.475
If I'm not there on time, leave.

39:59.994 --> 40:02.121
Put your thumb right there.

40:03.664 --> 40:06.428
- Thanks. That's all I need.
- Thank you.

40:10.338 --> 40:12.465
I'll just be a few moments.

40:16.277 --> 40:17.574
Glasses?

40:18.512 --> 40:19.672
Yes.

40:20.648 --> 40:24.015
Yeah, I found myself falling asleep
grading papers.

40:24.118 --> 40:25.312
When?

40:26.287 --> 40:28.380
I guess about a year ago.

40:30.124 --> 40:31.648
A year ago.

40:34.562 --> 40:38.191
Look at you.
How can you do this to yourself?

40:40.801 --> 40:43.065
I am hopeless without my wife.

40:43.704 --> 40:45.797
I can't even ride a bike.

40:48.476 --> 40:49.670
Sorry about the house.

40:54.582 --> 40:57.050
I won't know where to picture you.

40:58.519 --> 41:03.980
I close my eyes, I see Luke in his bedroom,
and you on the sofa by the window.

41:07.461 --> 41:10.328
I won't know where to picture you anymore.

41:25.513 --> 41:27.777
Show me where the bullets go.

41:30.518 --> 41:31.485
Hi, it's John.

41:31.852 --> 41:32.910
Luke's not feeling too well.

41:33.020 --> 41:36.285
So I'm gonna pick him up
and take him home, okay?

41:36.390 --> 41:39.382
I need Carl to cover my 3:00 class.

41:40.661 --> 41:41.855
Thanks.

42:25.539 --> 42:28.269
You ever gonna answer
your goddamn phone?

42:34.114 --> 42:36.241
You were supposed to leave.

42:38.219 --> 42:39.243
I need them.

42:40.354 --> 42:42.185
You notice that guy was a cop?

42:48.429 --> 42:49.418
Just give me the money.

42:58.873 --> 43:00.807
You want this too much.

43:01.742 --> 43:03.710
You're gonna fuck it up.

43:37.444 --> 43:39.105
Hey, Mr. Brennan.

43:43.384 --> 43:47.184
Today I'm gonna show you
how to make a key that can open any lock,

43:47.288 --> 43:48.949
It's called a bump key,

43:49.223 --> 43:51.350
First thing you need to do
is you need to find a key

43:51.458 --> 43:54.018
that can fit into the type of lock
that you're trying to open,

43:54.128 --> 43:56.494
Here I have a key
that fits into my front door,

43:56.597 --> 44:00.431
but I just changed the locks,
so it won't open,

44:00.534 --> 44:03.162
First thing you need to do
is secure your key,

44:03.270 --> 44:07.730
take a metal file and go through and
start taking those mountains and valleys

44:07.841 --> 44:10.401
all the way down
to the lowest possible setting on the key,

44:10.511 --> 44:13.036
The bump key works
by momentarily bumping those pins up,

44:13.147 --> 44:14.239
so that for a split second,

44:14.348 --> 44:18.876
the chamber is cleared of pins
and thus, able to turn and open,

45:19.013 --> 45:21.208
- Here you go.
- Don't touch that.

45:21.448 --> 45:23.439
- Sorry.
- Trying to do my job?

46:57.978 --> 46:59.775
So you are where in here?

47:03.283 --> 47:04.716
I'm in the middle there.

47:05.419 --> 47:08.252
In the middle. Can you point to yourself?

47:08.789 --> 47:09.915
That's me.

47:10.124 --> 47:11.352
There.

47:15.129 --> 47:18.223
So that's not you back there
by the elevators.

47:19.967 --> 47:22.492
No, no, I was around here somewhere.

47:24.505 --> 47:26.564
You wanna tell me what's going on?

47:27.875 --> 47:30.002
You want me to tell you?

47:32.646 --> 47:33.772
Yes.

47:35.315 --> 47:37.579
Do you know what a bump key is?

47:38.685 --> 47:39.879
Sorry?

47:47.628 --> 47:49.220
If this was you,

47:50.397 --> 47:53.059
you might wanna think about
what's gonna happen to your kids

47:53.167 --> 47:55.362
if both their parents end up in prison.

50:03.530 --> 50:04.861
Dad?

50:09.503 --> 50:10.765
Dad!

50:12.005 --> 50:13.404
Yeah, bud.

50:14.441 --> 50:15.669
Yeah.

50:18.845 --> 50:20.039
Thanks.

50:21.949 --> 50:26.477
So we arrested his wife, and now
we're gonna charge the man with vomiting.

50:27.120 --> 50:30.419
He's selling the house. Or he has a buyer.

50:31.525 --> 50:33.925
In this market? Lucky man.

50:35.162 --> 50:37.824
Can we possibly go do police work now?

50:41.068 --> 50:43.764
I don't know how you managed
to stay single this long.

50:57.050 --> 50:59.245
Dad, can I have my cookies?

51:00.053 --> 51:02.886
- You hungry? You want a sandwich?
- No.

51:05.325 --> 51:07.259
- There you go.
- Thanks.

51:13.767 --> 51:14.961
Carrie!

51:16.603 --> 51:19.970
I'm sorry.
She's just already got it all figured out.

51:22.376 --> 51:23.570
Nicole.

51:24.511 --> 51:26.479
- I remember.
- Really?

51:28.582 --> 51:29.844
I remember your daughter.

51:30.217 --> 51:32.378
Well, she's hard to forget.

51:44.498 --> 51:46.989
Luke was supposed to bring this home.

51:47.100 --> 51:49.227
He has his father's memory.

51:50.170 --> 51:54.436
It's for Carrie's birthday party.
Please, come. I'd love to meet your wife.

51:55.809 --> 51:57.572
She won't be there.

51:59.046 --> 52:00.707
It's complicated.

52:02.315 --> 52:04.545
I understand. With me, too.

52:07.554 --> 52:09.078
Carrie, come on, let's go.

52:10.190 --> 52:13.648
We're gonna grab a bite to eat.
Would you like to come?

52:14.094 --> 52:16.961
- No, I don't... We're kind of...
- Busy?

52:19.699 --> 52:22.259
Come on. We owe you for the cookies.

52:24.805 --> 52:25.829
Well, that's true.

52:26.339 --> 52:28.307
And I did make those cookies myself.

52:28.408 --> 52:30.399
And learned how to pre-package them.

52:37.117 --> 52:38.277
Come on, Luke.

52:41.221 --> 52:43.689
So, do you trade off time with Luke?

52:43.790 --> 52:46.452
No, Luke and I are together full-time.

52:46.560 --> 52:49.688
Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.

52:50.530 --> 52:53.988
She'd like nothing better than to be here,
with him.

52:54.101 --> 52:57.298
Lara, she... She misses all this.

52:59.506 --> 53:01.201
I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?

53:06.480 --> 53:08.471
No, she's not like that.

53:09.683 --> 53:11.378
She's in prison.

53:15.288 --> 53:17.722
- I don't tell most people.
- I understand.

53:17.824 --> 53:19.553
She's innocent. She didn't kill that woman.

53:20.994 --> 53:23.019
Good. I mean...

53:24.297 --> 53:26.128
I'm sure she didn't.

53:28.902 --> 53:31.234
We really should be going home.

53:31.338 --> 53:32.532
Okay.

53:33.340 --> 53:36.639
Thank you very much for the invitation.
We'll try and make it.

53:36.743 --> 53:38.506
That would be great.

53:38.879 --> 53:40.938
- Goodbye. Luke!
- Bye.

53:41.848 --> 53:43.110
Come on.

53:50.690 --> 53:52.317
Carrie, come on!

57:23.436 --> 57:24.630
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:24.738 --> 57:26.228
What's wrong?

57:27.907 --> 57:29.306
What is it?

57:36.583 --> 57:37.641
No.

57:38.151 --> 57:39.209
No.

57:40.653 --> 57:42.951
They can't move you without notice.

57:43.056 --> 57:45.047
Three days isn't notice.

57:45.658 --> 57:49.389
I was only here through the appeal.
We knew I was going to a prison.

57:53.900 --> 57:57.597
No, no, I don't have two weeks.
I gotta close the escrow tomorrow.

57:57.704 --> 58:00.502
Well, the title hasn't even been cleared yet.
I mean, there's no way I can...

58:00.607 --> 58:01.801
How much can they give me?

58:02.308 --> 58:03.332
Nothing!

58:32.872 --> 58:33.998
What are you doing here?

58:34.674 --> 58:35.732
I've got class.

58:39.012 --> 58:40.707
You be good, okay?

58:44.884 --> 58:45.873
Thanks.

59:59.726 --> 01:00:00.920
Are you okay? You're okay?

01:00:01.027 --> 01:00:02.358
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing?

01:00:02.462 --> 01:00:03.622
You almost killed us!

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:04.788
I'm so, so sorry.

01:00:04.898 --> 01:00:06.627
You're out of your mind. You don't look.

01:00:07.534 --> 01:00:09.832
Get away. Get away from us!

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:45.362
Hey.

01:00:51.044 --> 01:00:52.636
What's wrong?

01:00:52.745 --> 01:00:53.712
Nothing.

01:00:54.147 --> 01:00:55.478
Is it Luke?

01:00:55.582 --> 01:00:57.015
- No.
- What?

01:01:01.054 --> 01:01:03.545
I... I asked Meyer

01:01:04.123 --> 01:01:06.591
to look into not having you moved.

01:01:08.595 --> 01:01:12.554
I told him that traveling that distance
would be a hardship on us,

01:01:12.665 --> 01:01:14.724
that Luke was already having problems
at school, which is true.

01:01:14.834 --> 01:01:16.825
I haven't been spending
enough time with him.

01:01:17.403 --> 01:01:18.768
You haven't?

01:01:19.105 --> 01:01:20.197
No.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.573
You haven't?

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.279
Jesus, John.

01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:31.374
You really are too much.

01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:36.320
Luke is having a hard time,
because Mommy's in jail for murder,

01:01:36.422 --> 01:01:39.789
not because Daddy doesn't spend
enough time with him.

01:01:41.394 --> 01:01:44.522
Your father was right. You really don't
live in the same world we do.

01:01:46.933 --> 01:01:49.595
That's nice, that the two of you talk.

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:52.394
What world do I live in, Lara?

01:01:52.505 --> 01:01:55.065
Well, I don't know, John,
but it's not the real one.

01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:57.438
The one in which I'm in here
for the rest of my life.

01:01:57.543 --> 01:02:01.138
So don't be talking to me about fantasies
like there's some happily ever...

01:02:01.447 --> 01:02:02.937
We good here?

01:02:05.952 --> 01:02:07.613
Yes. Sorry.

01:02:20.466 --> 01:02:23.196
Now you're gonna sit here all long-faced,
like you let me down.

01:02:23.302 --> 01:02:26.135
I mean, what do you want me to do here?
You want me to make you feel better?

01:02:26.239 --> 01:02:27.433
Got it.

01:02:28.374 --> 01:02:29.739
I'm sorry.

01:02:29.842 --> 01:02:31.400
Now you're apologizing.

01:02:31.511 --> 01:02:33.445
You really are a gem.

01:02:33.546 --> 01:02:36.674
- What do you want from me, Lara?
- What do I want from you? Nothing.

01:02:36.783 --> 01:02:38.478
You're already too perfect.

01:02:39.419 --> 01:02:41.614
You know,
you never even asked me if I did it.

01:02:42.522 --> 01:02:44.752
- If I killed her.
- Because I know you didn't.

01:02:44.857 --> 01:02:46.882
Well, then you'd be wrong.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.373
I'm done.

01:03:37.844 --> 01:03:39.971
Sir, you can't stand there.

01:03:40.747 --> 01:03:43.580
Sir, I need you to leave the building now.

01:03:44.317 --> 01:03:45.409
Sir?

01:04:02.802 --> 01:04:04.394
- What?
- Shut up.

01:04:05.838 --> 01:04:09.069
I don't care what you say or how you say it.

01:04:10.843 --> 01:04:12.401
I don't believe you did it.

01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:15.908
And I never will.

01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:22.319
I know who you are.

01:04:24.757 --> 01:04:26.725
And I promise you

01:04:28.394 --> 01:04:30.555
this will not be your life.

01:07:45.825 --> 01:07:47.053
Shut up!

01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:02.197
- I don't know what's going on, man.
- You done?

01:08:02.308 --> 01:08:03.275
Everybody is out.

01:08:03.376 --> 01:08:05.276
I gotta get back to Jimmy.

01:08:07.546 --> 01:08:09.514
Back away! Back away!

01:08:12.318 --> 01:08:13.376
Drop the gun! Drop it!

01:08:13.753 --> 01:08:15.118
Put the dog away!

01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:16.551
You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:19.816
- You want the police here, asshole?
- Good idea!

01:08:23.395 --> 01:08:24.522
Get in, get in, get in!

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.188
- You, too!
- I'm not getting in there!

01:08:26.298 --> 01:08:27.925
Get in there!

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:29.001
Get in! Get in! Get in!

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:33.828
All right, lock it. Lock the door.

01:08:36.075 --> 01:08:37.508
- Move!
- You are dead.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:39.407
- I didn't do anything.
- You brought him here!

01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:40.979
I didn't bring him!

01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:45.145
On your knees! On the floor!

01:08:52.925 --> 01:08:54.620
All right. Where's your money?

01:08:56.996 --> 01:08:59.487
Here. It's worth it to get rid of you.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:01.389
- Where's the rest?
- Here.

01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:03.965
- Take more.
- Where do you keep your money?

01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:05.867
I'm gonna give my money to you. Yeah.

01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:07.939
- I'll shoot you.
- You can't even shoot a dog.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.701
- I'll kill you both!
- No, I'm gonna kill you both!

01:09:09.809 --> 01:09:12.607
- Just give him your money!
- Keep your dead bitch mouth shut!

01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:13.678
Give him your money!

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.169
Jesus!

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:23.050
See? You ain't gonna kill me.

01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:25.783
This is the worst you could do?

01:09:27.126 --> 01:09:30.892
Go home.
I'll come, I'll find you and I'll kill you.

01:09:40.005 --> 01:09:41.996
You're wasting some good shit there!

01:09:42.108 --> 01:09:43.075
Yeah, good shit.

01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:44.401
High alcohol content.

01:09:50.616 --> 01:09:52.049
What are you gonna do?
You gonna burn me out?

01:09:52.283 --> 01:09:54.377
Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do.

01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:55.511
Jesus Christ!

01:09:55.621 --> 01:09:57.418
This is a meth lab, you idiot!

01:09:57.857 --> 01:09:58.949
No.

01:09:59.692 --> 01:10:00.989
It was.

01:10:02.895 --> 01:10:04.157
Tell me! Where's your money?

01:10:04.263 --> 01:10:05.992
My kid is upstairs!

01:10:06.732 --> 01:10:08.097
My kid is upstairs!

01:10:10.302 --> 01:10:11.462
- Get up!
- Jesus!

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:12.764
Get up!

01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:34.886
Please.

01:10:36.262 --> 01:10:38.025
Please, let me go, please.

01:11:18.003 --> 01:11:19.470
Anybody here?

01:11:47.233 --> 01:11:48.996
Don't leave me here.

01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:51.763
I don't wanna die here.

01:11:57.109 --> 01:11:58.201
Please!

01:12:33.812 --> 01:12:35.871
Please, get me to a hospital!

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.108
I can't breathe.

01:12:45.624 --> 01:12:46.852
Please.

01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:55.460
I can't breathe.

01:13:00.439 --> 01:13:02.430
I can't... I can't...

01:14:16.315 --> 01:14:18.010
Get out of my way.

01:14:23.756 --> 01:14:25.986
- What do we have?
- A freaking miracle.

01:14:26.091 --> 01:14:28.855
Meth lab in the basement,
the house still standing.

01:14:28.961 --> 01:14:30.690
Should be just a crater.

01:14:30.796 --> 01:14:31.888
We know him?

01:14:31.997 --> 01:14:35.433
Alex Gaidar,
history of violence and drug trafficking.

01:14:45.177 --> 01:14:46.439
He have a kid?

01:14:46.545 --> 01:14:48.740
Neighbor said wife left with him last year.

01:14:49.148 --> 01:14:50.911
Big surprise there.

01:14:51.316 --> 01:14:52.943
And this blood,

01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:57.245
they type it all yet?

01:14:57.356 --> 01:15:00.382
No, but someone left through
the back door bleeding.

01:15:00.492 --> 01:15:04.121
Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead
on a transit bench.

01:15:50.442 --> 01:15:51.409
Hey.

01:15:53.745 --> 01:15:55.372
I've just come to pick up Luke.

01:15:55.481 --> 01:15:57.073
He's sound asleep.

01:15:59.818 --> 01:16:02.218
Yeah, I've just come to get Luke.

01:16:07.092 --> 01:16:08.059
John.

01:16:11.363 --> 01:16:13.058
Are you all right?

01:16:13.765 --> 01:16:15.323
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:16:26.011 --> 01:16:27.376
Hey, buddy.

01:16:27.779 --> 01:16:30.111
Wake up, bud, we're going home.

01:17:33.445 --> 01:17:34.810
So, what do you say?

01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:37.672
Thank you, Grandma.

01:17:37.783 --> 01:17:39.444
I think you should give Grandma a big kiss.

01:17:39.551 --> 01:17:41.644
- I'm too tired for kisses.
- Buddy.

01:17:41.753 --> 01:17:45.587
That's okay.
I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.

01:17:46.091 --> 01:17:48.389
We want to take him
to the Fall Festival in Kutztown

01:17:48.493 --> 01:17:50.461
where the Clydesdales are.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.429
- See you.
- Bye.

01:17:58.570 --> 01:17:59.628
Bye.

01:18:01.506 --> 01:18:02.632
Hey.

01:18:06.678 --> 01:18:08.441
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Bye.

01:18:25.964 --> 01:18:27.226
Goodbye.

01:18:39.277 --> 01:18:40.539
Bye, Mom.

01:18:40.979 --> 01:18:42.071
Bye.

01:19:02.813 --> 01:19:04.940
You're getting sentimental in your old age.

01:19:05.882 --> 01:19:07.076
Yeah.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.914
Well, might as well have some coffee.

01:19:35.779 --> 01:19:37.144
Yo! Idiots!

01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:43.278
Can I carry him?

01:19:43.787 --> 01:19:46.551
No, bud. Only what fits in the bag, all right?

01:19:52.395 --> 01:19:54.158
What about my pockets?

01:19:54.264 --> 01:19:55.856
Or your pockets.

01:21:24.654 --> 01:21:25.621
Hello?

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:29.619
Hello?

01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:56.613
Bud? I'll be back in a moment, okay?

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.687
Okay.

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:33.755
Hey, bud.

01:22:34.791 --> 01:22:35.917
So...

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.527
You all right?

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:40.588
Yeah.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:44.891
They're calling all the party animals.

01:22:45.368 --> 01:22:47.734
922 Yetta Street.

01:22:48.638 --> 01:22:49.605
I know where that is.

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.131
Okay? Here we go.

01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:14.192
Yeah, taillight matches
any 2004 to 2009 Prius.

01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:16.961
What kind of criminal drives a Prius?

01:23:17.067 --> 01:23:18.398
A socially responsible one.

01:23:19.169 --> 01:23:22.332
There's over 1,000 registered in the city,
7,000 in the state.

01:23:23.006 --> 01:23:25.998
- How many are registered to felons?
- Six in the state.

01:23:26.109 --> 01:23:30.409
Four to embezzlers, white-collar criminals,
one to a rapist, one to a murderer.

01:23:30.513 --> 01:23:33.277
- Start with the murderer.
- She's in prison for life.

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:34.739
Rapist is out.

01:23:38.788 --> 01:23:40.050
Find him.

01:23:41.658 --> 01:23:42.886
Come on.

01:23:47.998 --> 01:23:49.488
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.725
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:59.431
- Hi, Luke.
- It's a pony.

01:24:00.343 --> 01:24:02.402
Those aren't easy to wrap.

01:24:05.115 --> 01:24:07.845
- You know the party is not until 11:00, right?
- Really?

01:24:09.152 --> 01:24:13.350
What is it? Around 9:00? I'm sorry.
I should've read it more carefully.

01:24:13.456 --> 01:24:16.948
It's no problem.
Why don't you go give this to Carrie?

01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:21.754
Well, I guess you can help.

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:24.123
Actually, I've gotta go
and run some errands.

01:24:25.235 --> 01:24:26.202
Sorry.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:30.868
We'll see you later then.

01:24:32.308 --> 01:24:33.866
Thanks so much.

01:24:39.182 --> 01:24:41.480
He has my parents' phone number.

01:24:42.252 --> 01:24:44.982
In his jacket. Top pocket of his jacket.

01:24:47.757 --> 01:24:49.554
If I'm running late.

01:24:50.326 --> 01:24:51.725
No problem.

01:25:02.205 --> 01:25:05.538
The rapist is in a wheelchair.
Not sure if that was karma or just bad luck.

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:07.803
The murderer. Where is she incarcerated?

01:25:07.911 --> 01:25:09.435
County, right here in town.

01:25:09.546 --> 01:25:12.913
Does she have a husband
or a kid old enough to drive?

01:25:27.097 --> 01:25:28.496
Yes? What?

01:25:29.065 --> 01:25:31.124
Lara Brennan's blood work.

01:25:34.437 --> 01:25:35.734
Get the lab.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:45.345
You pissed somebody off, that's for sure.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.246
- It's still busy. I'll keep trying.
- No. Get an ambulance.

01:25:53.723 --> 01:25:57.284
Take her to University Hospital.
I'll meet them there.

01:25:58.962 --> 01:26:01.089
Right. Thanks.

01:26:01.731 --> 01:26:02.857
Husband, schoolteacher.

01:26:03.633 --> 01:26:05.624
You got a home address?

01:27:11.801 --> 01:27:14.668
No car in the garage.
You want to get a warrant?

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:15.897
Yeah.

01:27:46.069 --> 01:27:47.468
Get the warrant.

01:28:30.713 --> 01:28:33.409
Lara Brennan's being transferred
to University Hospital.

01:28:33.516 --> 01:28:34.915
- Right now?
- Right now.

01:28:35.551 --> 01:28:37.246
Have them call the escort vehicle.

01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:39.253
Tell them we'll meet them at the hospital
in less than 10.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:47.652
Yeah. Yeah, we're here.
Prisoner's secure. No problems.

01:28:49.198 --> 01:28:50.460
Will do.

01:28:52.135 --> 01:28:53.102
Hands where I can see 'em.

01:28:53.536 --> 01:28:54.503
John?

01:28:54.604 --> 01:28:55.832
And the phone.

01:28:56.172 --> 01:28:57.298
What are you doing here, John?

01:28:57.407 --> 01:28:58.601
Put your hands on your head.

01:28:59.475 --> 01:29:00.806
John, what are you doing?

01:29:01.177 --> 01:29:03.145
Uncuff her. Kneel down.

01:29:05.014 --> 01:29:06.675
John, stop this.

01:29:07.784 --> 01:29:09.081
Kneel down. Face the wall.

01:29:14.757 --> 01:29:16.418
Unit 2242 secure,

01:29:17.226 --> 01:29:19.057
- She just said...
- Just take the light.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.192
Hands and feet, pull 'em as tight as you can.

01:29:26.302 --> 01:29:29.601
You walk out that door with him,
you will both be dead.

01:29:29.706 --> 01:29:31.105
- Shut up.
- John, he's right.

01:29:31.207 --> 01:29:33.505
Listen to him. You're gonna get us killed.

01:29:33.609 --> 01:29:36.100
- Why are you doing this?
- Because we have no other choice!

01:29:36.212 --> 01:29:37.577
- Put 'em on.
- No. That's not true!

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.942
- Put the clothes on, Lara.
- No.

01:29:39.048 --> 01:29:40.481
- Now!
- No!

01:29:41.484 --> 01:29:42.473
Okay.

01:29:43.186 --> 01:29:46.246
You call your son
and tell him you're not coming.

01:29:46.356 --> 01:29:47.584
- Where is he?
- He's waiting for you.

01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:48.918
You wanna tell him you're not coming?

01:29:49.359 --> 01:29:51.088
- How can you do this to me?
- Push "send."

01:29:51.194 --> 01:29:52.525
Tell him I'm not coming, either.

01:29:53.296 --> 01:29:55.662
- John.
- Does it look like I'm going home, Lara?

01:29:56.499 --> 01:30:01.368
You call him, tell him he's alone now
and his mom and dad are not coming back.

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:04.573
Jesus, John.

01:30:05.975 --> 01:30:07.738
You son of a bitch.

01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:23.354
I'm Dr. Lifson.
You've got a patient here from County Jail.

01:30:23.459 --> 01:30:24.448
Lara Brennan?

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:27.927
Yes, we started an IV.
D50 with 20 units of insulin.

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:36.961
Copy.

01:30:44.414 --> 01:30:45.676
Security!

01:30:46.849 --> 01:30:47.941
Security!

01:30:50.553 --> 01:30:51.884
Out! Out!

01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:21.676
- Hey, hey.
- Back away!

01:31:21.784 --> 01:31:22.978
- Now don't be stupid.
- You stay back!

01:31:23.085 --> 01:31:26.020
We have units at every exit, John.
You will be shot trying to leave.

01:31:26.122 --> 01:31:27.089
Hit the button, Lara.

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:28.657
- Stop.
- Hit the button!

01:31:28.758 --> 01:31:30.521
John, do not do this.

01:31:31.627 --> 01:31:33.959
- Where are the stairs?
- There.

01:31:34.063 --> 01:31:36.964
Male and female, white lab coats,
parking levels.

01:31:38.167 --> 01:31:40.192
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

01:31:42.371 --> 01:31:45.204
Look at me, look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:31:45.308 --> 01:31:48.971
Just do what I say when I say it.
Everything will be okay.

01:31:49.479 --> 01:31:51.879
Lara, take the coat off.

01:31:53.282 --> 01:31:54.271
Come on.

01:31:57.286 --> 01:31:59.015
It's okay. You stay here.

01:31:59.121 --> 01:32:00.213
All security personnel...

01:32:12.735 --> 01:32:14.532
- Watch the door!
- Yeah.

01:32:48.404 --> 01:32:49.530
Stop.

01:32:50.406 --> 01:32:51.566
Shit.

01:32:52.575 --> 01:32:53.564
Who's in the lobby?

01:32:56.946 --> 01:32:59.141
Hey, listen. Is anybody in the lobby?

01:33:15.398 --> 01:33:16.831
Don't look.

01:33:19.335 --> 01:33:20.324
Run!

01:33:22.572 --> 01:33:23.561
Great!

01:33:23.673 --> 01:33:24.640
Back here!

01:33:30.079 --> 01:33:31.068
Move.

01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:36.379
Let's get moving!

01:33:40.289 --> 01:33:41.551
Come on.

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:48.990
Here!

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.742
Hey, hey!

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.919
Go Penguins!

01:34:13.022 --> 01:34:14.751
Let your hair down.

01:34:23.265 --> 01:34:25.529
Harris, that way. Go!

01:34:41.117 --> 01:34:42.209
Hey!

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.299
Harris, they're in the subway.
Harris! The subway!

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:02.371
Got it.

01:35:14.850 --> 01:35:15.839
They're on the platform!

01:35:15.951 --> 01:35:20.047
Block stations in either directions!
Call the Port Authority. Stop all the trains!

01:35:35.171 --> 01:35:36.695
Wait, wait, wait.

01:35:37.707 --> 01:35:39.402
What are we doing?

01:35:42.778 --> 01:35:45.576
Stand clear of the closing doors, please,

01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:50.816
Move! Pittsburgh PD!

01:35:52.388 --> 01:35:56.154
The train on track four, I want it stopped.
Stop that train!

01:36:09.205 --> 01:36:11.173
Next stop...

01:36:47.309 --> 01:36:48.367
Hold on to me.

01:36:48.477 --> 01:36:50.104
Hey, kid, two hands.

01:37:03.459 --> 01:37:04.790
No. No.

01:37:13.602 --> 01:37:14.569
This way.

01:37:16.705 --> 01:37:17.694
There.

01:38:03.118 --> 01:38:04.244
- Red light.
- Hold on.

01:38:04.353 --> 01:38:05.718
Red light!

01:38:30.145 --> 01:38:32.807
Ring the city. Close bus and train stations.

01:38:32.915 --> 01:38:34.974
And get their description
to the state police.

01:38:35.084 --> 01:38:36.051
Copy that,

01:38:36.151 --> 01:38:38.483
- How old is their damn kid?
- Six.

01:38:38.954 --> 01:38:40.854
Find out where he is.

01:38:45.794 --> 01:38:47.955
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You would've stopped me.

01:38:49.398 --> 01:38:51.161
Your insulin is in here.

01:38:51.267 --> 01:38:53.792
There's a case in here.
It's got a brush, moisturizer, makeup.

01:38:53.903 --> 01:38:56.838
Everything you had was old.
I hope I got it right.

01:39:06.782 --> 01:39:09.114
You remember where you last saw him?

01:39:09.218 --> 01:39:12.187
You want to take a guess
who just escaped from jail?

01:39:12.288 --> 01:39:13.312
Hold on a second.

01:39:19.361 --> 01:39:21.761
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm here to pick up my son.

01:39:21.864 --> 01:39:23.126
They aren't back yet.

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:26.191
Back from where?

01:39:26.302 --> 01:39:27.792
From the zoo.

01:39:31.006 --> 01:39:32.200
It's a zoo party.

01:39:33.842 --> 01:39:36.868
They should be back in about an hour
if you'd like to wait.

01:39:36.979 --> 01:39:38.469
No. Thank you.

01:39:42.952 --> 01:39:44.977
What's wrong? What is it?

01:39:46.188 --> 01:39:48.622
- Where is he? Where's Luke?
- He's at the party.

01:39:48.724 --> 01:39:50.521
What party? You said the party was here.

01:39:50.626 --> 01:39:53.459
I was wrong. She's taken them to the zoo.

01:39:55.464 --> 01:39:58.456
- Destination, Pittsburgh Zoo,
- She?

01:39:59.001 --> 01:40:02.630
Estimated drive time, 17 minutes,

01:40:02.738 --> 01:40:04.706
Carrie's mother, Nicole.

01:40:26.128 --> 01:40:27.288
Check the neighbors!

01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:30.627
We're looking for the boy and anything
they've noticed in the last few days.

01:41:38.467 --> 01:41:41.493
Time to destination, 11 minutes,

01:41:48.477 --> 01:41:51.412
In 1,000 feet, bear left,

01:41:57.719 --> 01:42:01.211
In 500 feet, bear left,

01:42:07.729 --> 01:42:10.721
In 100 feet, bear left,

01:42:14.636 --> 01:42:16.001
Bear left,

01:42:24.012 --> 01:42:26.105
You took the wrong turn.

01:42:26.215 --> 01:42:27.978
John, the zoo's behind us.
You took the wrong turn.

01:42:28.083 --> 01:42:29.072
Babe, what are you doing?

01:42:29.184 --> 01:42:30.208
She'll call my parents.

01:42:30.686 --> 01:42:32.176
- What?
- They'll look after him,

01:42:32.287 --> 01:42:34.118
and I'll figure out a way of getting him to us.

01:42:34.223 --> 01:42:35.315
Are you out of your mind?

01:42:35.424 --> 01:42:36.823
I tried! There's no more time!

01:42:36.925 --> 01:42:38.859
Any second now,
there's gonna be a roadblock ahead of us.

01:42:38.961 --> 01:42:42.192
It might be there now!
If we don't get out now, we don't get out!

01:42:42.297 --> 01:42:45.664
I'll find a way of getting him to us, all right?
I'll find a way.

01:46:16.345 --> 01:46:19.508
No, really, it's fine. I just can't thank you
enough for taking care of him.

01:46:19.614 --> 01:46:20.774
Hey, it was our pleasure.

01:46:48.210 --> 01:46:49.302
Hi.

01:47:22.043 --> 01:47:24.409
I'm going to sit back here, okay?

01:47:26.448 --> 01:47:27.415
Sure.

01:48:09.357 --> 01:48:11.723
The traffic is backing up at the toll plazas,

01:48:11.827 --> 01:48:14.523
It's worse downtown where police
have cordoned off the train station

01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:16.426
and are searching all passengers,

01:48:16.531 --> 01:48:19.398
Joining us from Union Station,
our very own Sylvia Patterson,

01:48:19.501 --> 01:48:20.468
John?

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.305
What are we gonna do?

01:48:37.619 --> 01:48:40.053
We're going to the train station.

01:49:22.063 --> 01:49:23.928
- Stay in the car.
- Okay.

01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:12.341
Sir, I'm sorry the mayor was delayed,
but I did not tell them to stop every vehicle.

01:50:12.447 --> 01:50:15.211
Just the ones with a couple and a child.

01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:17.411
Sir, I know my...

01:50:18.954 --> 01:50:20.285
Yes, sir.

01:50:58.226 --> 01:51:02.754
Are you sure $20 is enough?
Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that.

01:51:03.832 --> 01:51:06.892
Yeah. We're going that way anyway.

01:52:07.996 --> 01:52:12.695
Go wider. Send their photos to every train,
bus station and airport in a 300-mile radius.

01:52:12.801 --> 01:52:15.599
So Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia,

01:52:15.704 --> 01:52:19.401
New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan,
Kentucky and Indiana?

01:52:20.008 --> 01:52:22.169
You know what direction they're going in,
smart-ass?

01:52:33.288 --> 01:52:35.756
- See you again, Tom.
- Thanks again.

01:52:49.871 --> 01:52:50.895
You want to see it?

01:52:51.206 --> 01:52:52.935
Only if it will tell me where they are.

01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:54.731
Not so lucky.

01:53:15.797 --> 01:53:18.425
Excuse me. Do you call this coffee?

01:53:26.674 --> 01:53:28.699
How many airports in Ontario and Quebec?

01:53:28.810 --> 01:53:30.778
You want me to stop calling and count?

01:53:32.814 --> 01:53:35.681
- Long way to go with just a carry-on.
- I'm sorry?

01:53:35.784 --> 01:53:38.048
Long way to go with just a carry-on.

01:53:39.721 --> 01:53:43.054
You know how many times
you guys have lost our bags?

01:53:44.025 --> 01:53:46.755
Here's your tickets and boarding passes.

01:53:47.796 --> 01:53:49.024
Thank you.

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:53.360
They found the parents.

01:54:17.792 --> 01:54:21.250
You decided to go for a drive
for the entire day?

01:54:21.696 --> 01:54:23.960
George wanted to see the leaves.

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.381
And you have absolutely no idea
where they're going, right?

01:54:42.483 --> 01:54:44.576
I told you. We never spoke.

01:55:12.547 --> 01:55:13.571
Hey.

01:55:15.984 --> 01:55:17.451
I'll do this.

01:55:27.862 --> 01:55:29.193
Go ahead, Luke.

01:55:32.033 --> 01:55:33.000
Hello.

01:55:47.081 --> 01:55:49.641
You look like you need to get away.

01:56:00.028 --> 01:56:01.359
Thank you.

01:56:03.598 --> 01:56:05.156
Come on, buddy.

01:56:35.563 --> 01:56:38.396
- Too bad you didn't find more of it.
- Yeah.

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.798
And I wish I could figure out where this is.

01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:45.562
I checked Web sites for every
tourist destination I could think of.

01:56:46.941 --> 01:56:49.171
- That's the Presidential Palace.
- What?

01:56:49.277 --> 01:56:52.576
It was all over CNN
when it collapsed during the earthquake.

01:56:56.250 --> 01:56:57.877
We know where they're going!

01:56:57.986 --> 01:56:59.214
Show me.

01:57:00.355 --> 01:57:03.950
Thank you for waiting,
We'll soon begin boarding by rows,

01:57:07.562 --> 01:57:10.156
Hold them at the gate. Take a look.

01:57:11.499 --> 01:57:12.796
Let's go!

01:57:34.255 --> 01:57:36.382
Excuse me, folks. No one else on.

01:57:37.058 --> 01:57:40.186
Excuse me, folks. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

01:57:58.413 --> 01:58:01.143
Sorry. There's no one by that description
on this flight.

01:58:01.449 --> 01:58:03.041
No. They're on it.

01:58:03.151 --> 01:58:04.345
Do you have the photographs?

01:58:04.452 --> 01:58:06.784
We have the photographs.
They're not on this plane.

01:58:09.424 --> 01:58:11.722
Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight?

01:58:11.826 --> 01:58:13.589
Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight?

01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:17.930
No other flights. Anything else?

01:58:24.072 --> 01:58:26.700
No. No. Thank you.

01:58:30.611 --> 01:58:31.976
It's starting to rain.

01:58:36.818 --> 01:58:38.513
I'll call the FBI.

01:58:45.126 --> 01:58:49.290
You ever ask yourself
why we found this bag and not the others?

01:58:58.406 --> 01:59:00.704
The captain has switched off
the seat belt light,

01:59:00.808 --> 01:59:05.643
Flight time to Caracas, Venezuela,
this evening is five hours and 32 minutes,

01:59:05.746 --> 01:59:10.274
While in your seat, the captain asks
that you keep your seat belt fastened,

01:59:16.257 --> 01:59:18.054
This guy's a teacher?

01:59:18.693 --> 01:59:20.593
At a community college.

02:01:00.628 --> 02:01:01.822
Hey!

02:03:05.986 --> 02:03:08.614
- She heard a button pop.
- What?

02:03:14.862 --> 02:03:16.762
She heard a button pop.

02:03:24.438 --> 02:03:26.998
Was it raining when we searched the scene?

02:03:27.108 --> 02:03:28.473
Three years ago?

02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:30.643
What are we doing here?

02:03:56.837 --> 02:03:59.704
Why don't you act like a cop?
Grab the other side.

02:03:59.807 --> 02:04:01.001
You're out of your mind.

02:04:03.377 --> 02:04:05.072
- Ready?
- Yeah.

02:04:08.883 --> 02:04:09.907
You got it?

02:04:25.232 --> 02:04:27.166
You really thought you were gonna find it?

02:04:28.305 --> 02:04:34.779
