00:01.079 --> 00:04.120
Tonight on The Curse of Oak Isand
Everything's closing in.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.470
We're running out of time.

00:05.470 --> 00:07.350
...it's the exciting
season finale.

00:07.350 --> 00:08.920
No record of this?
No.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.580
Maybe there's something
on the other side of it.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.250
(excited shouting)

00:12.250 --> 00:14.550
The Rochefoucaulds shared
the truth of Oak Island

00:14.550 --> 00:15.830
with the Founding Fathers.

00:15.830 --> 00:17.439
BRUCE:
They used the treasure

00:17.439 --> 00:18.949
to finance
the Revolutionary War.

00:18.949 --> 00:21.609
MARTY: Holy smokes.
-RICK: What's that symbol?

00:21.609 --> 00:23.551
DOUG:
George Washington designed it.

00:23.551 --> 00:25.109
JUSTIN: It matches perfectly.
GARY: Holy schmoly.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.740
-There's a wall here!
-Isn't that something?

00:26.740 --> 00:29.580
I mean, that's evidence.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.129
NARRATOR:
There is an island

00:33.129 --> 00:35.409
in the North Atlantic

00:35.409 --> 00:38.020
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.020 --> 00:41.070
for more than 200 years.

00:41.070 --> 00:45.030
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:45.030 --> 00:47.809
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.809 --> 00:50.950
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.950 --> 00:54.680
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.680 --> 00:57.420
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:57.420 --> 01:02.430
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.179
And, according to legend,

01:04.179 --> 01:07.179
one more will have to die

01:07.179 --> 01:09.410
before the treasure
can be found.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:25.510 --> 01:26.960
-MARTY: There he is!
-DAVE: How you doing, Dad?

01:26.960 --> 01:27.840
(laughter)

01:27.840 --> 01:28.930
DAN:
What do you say, Marty?

01:28.930 --> 01:30.181
How are you, bud?

01:30.181 --> 01:31.581
I thought you had a little sense

01:31.581 --> 01:32.581
and had gone home.

01:32.581 --> 01:33.881
No, I'm here on Oak Island.

01:33.881 --> 01:34.881
Doesn't that tell you something?

01:34.881 --> 01:36.681
NARRATOR:
It is an exciting moment

01:36.681 --> 01:38.840
for brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

01:39.140 --> 01:43.330
as they join Dave Blankenship
to share with Dave's father

01:43.330 --> 01:44.880
and their partner,

01:44.880 --> 01:48.150
veteran Oak Island treasure
hunter Dan Blankenship,

01:48.150 --> 01:50.159
the most significant
breakthrough yet

01:50.159 --> 01:51.400
in their team's quest

01:51.400 --> 01:55.670
to solve
a 223-year-old mystery.

01:55.670 --> 01:59.210
Daniel, we do have
some information

01:59.210 --> 02:00.960
I think you're
gonna find interesting.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.300
Okay.
-So, in Smith's Cove,

02:03.300 --> 02:05.450
we cut the ends
off those big logs,

02:05.450 --> 02:07.770
on the U-shaped structure.
I saw the logs.

02:07.770 --> 02:10.560
Do you know
what dendrochronology is?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.600
Do you know what that is?

02:11.600 --> 02:13.000
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, okay.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.310
We cut discs off 'em.

02:14.310 --> 02:16.530
Yeah?
And the slipway.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.130
And the slipway.
The slipway. And we sent it

02:19.130 --> 02:22.840
to this guy at the
University of Saskatchewan.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.850
World's expert in this area,

02:24.850 --> 02:27.730
in dendrochronology,
and he got a date

02:27.730 --> 02:30.480
that he says-- get this--

02:30.480 --> 02:34.110
it's 99.99% accurate,

02:34.110 --> 02:35.890
to the year.
(Dan chuckles)

02:35.890 --> 02:38.390
They believe in what
they're doing, obviously.

02:38.390 --> 02:40.510
Exactly.
The date they came up with

02:40.510 --> 02:42.470
was 1769.

02:42.470 --> 02:45.980
25 years before the Money Pit.

02:45.980 --> 02:48.161
25 years before
the Money Pit

02:48.161 --> 02:49.680
was discovered?
Yes. Yes.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
Yes.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.680
Okay, now...

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
now i-it's starting
to register.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.680
Wow, that's a heck of a wall,

02:53.680 --> 02:54.680
-isn't it?
-Yep!

02:54.680 --> 03:01.050
NARRATOR:
Over the past several months,

03:01.050 --> 03:03.209
Rick, Marty and their team

03:03.209 --> 03:05.690
have conducted the most
extensive investigation

03:05.690 --> 03:07.630
of Smith's Cove in the history

03:07.630 --> 03:10.430
of the Oak Island
treasure hunt.

03:10.430 --> 03:13.880
Although their prime objective
has been to locate the place

03:13.880 --> 03:15.860
where five stone box drains

03:15.860 --> 03:18.790
first discovered in 1850

03:18.790 --> 03:20.489
converge into
a single flood tunnel

03:20.489 --> 03:22.970
which feeds ocean water
into the Money Pit...

03:22.970 --> 03:24.610
RICK:
It's very strange.

03:24.610 --> 03:26.280
This is totally undiscovered.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.300
...they have unearthed
a number of incredible

03:30.300 --> 03:33.620
and mysterious
man-made formations.

03:33.620 --> 03:36.370
Some of these,
such as a concrete wall,

03:36.370 --> 03:38.930
were never reported
by previous searchers.

03:38.930 --> 03:43.069
Although, two others,
known respectively

03:43.069 --> 03:45.160
as the "L-shaped"
and "U-shaped" structures,

03:45.160 --> 03:48.319
and which are both
made of wood,

03:48.319 --> 03:50.870
were first discovered
by Dan Blankenship

03:50.870 --> 03:53.440
when he conducted his own
large-scale investigation

03:53.440 --> 03:58.200
of Smith's Cove
in the early 1970s.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.130
Somebody was building
something big in Smith's Cove.

04:01.130 --> 04:04.070
I thought that was old,
but, I mean,

04:04.070 --> 04:06.540
I was never clear, Rick,

04:06.540 --> 04:07.580
on that structure--

04:07.580 --> 04:10.319
whether It was original or not.
Right.

04:10.319 --> 04:14.489
But what Marty just said
are the facts. 1769.

04:14.489 --> 04:17.699
I don't think I ever had anyone
that's come in and said

04:17.699 --> 04:21.500
-they're 99.9% sure...
This guy did.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.879
...of-of the date.

04:22.879 --> 04:24.770
I have the written results
right here.

04:24.770 --> 04:27.130
The dendrochronology results.

04:27.130 --> 04:30.599
The main ones are here.

04:30.599 --> 04:32.789
That is interesting.
Yeah.

04:32.789 --> 04:34.189
Marty finds it
incredibly interesting.

04:34.189 --> 04:35.189
I do.
Dan: Yeah.

04:35.189 --> 04:36.960
I thought everything
we were finding here

04:36.960 --> 04:39.389
was searcher, but not that.

04:39.389 --> 04:41.490
Something was original there.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.080
Yeah.
-RICK: Dan's life has seen

04:43.080 --> 04:45.710
all kinds of changes,
and they've all centered

04:45.710 --> 04:47.800
around Oak Island
and the mystery.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.930
So, you know, to give him
these answers this year

04:51.930 --> 04:54.349
is important,
because he's always said,

04:54.349 --> 04:57.460
"Look, I just want answers,
yay or nay."

04:57.460 --> 05:01.530
Well, hopefully, maybe this
might provide him those answers.

05:01.530 --> 05:03.210
You're up to speed now.
We want to make sure

05:03.210 --> 05:07.180
you know what we know,
so we're going to, uh,

05:07.180 --> 05:08.520
get back to work.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.669
All right?
I hear you.

05:11.669 --> 05:12.669
(laughter)

05:12.669 --> 05:14.661
MARTY:
Thanks for the time, partner.

05:14.661 --> 05:17.159
We'll be back with more.

05:17.159 --> 05:18.949
NARRATOR:
Following their meeting

05:18.949 --> 05:21.349
with Dan Blankenship,

05:21.349 --> 05:23.819
Rick and Marty join
other members of their team

05:23.819 --> 05:25.550
at Smith's Cove,

05:25.550 --> 05:28.099
where they are continuing
their massive excavation

05:28.099 --> 05:29.839
underneath the beach area

05:29.839 --> 05:33.120
in search of the so-called
flood tunnel convergence point.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.750
Billy wants to figure out how
far back we want to go to dig

05:36.750 --> 05:38.590
to get rid of the crane pad.
I want to...

05:38.590 --> 05:39.590
I want to dig right there.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.240
I want to dig
right in the center

05:42.240 --> 05:43.240
of the U-shaped structure

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
as soon as you can.
Right.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.060
If we're gonna get this,
let's get it.

05:46.060 --> 05:49.439
I just think whoever built it
had information

05:49.439 --> 05:52.069
and put it there on purpose,
'cause it's relatively small.

05:52.069 --> 05:54.210
Then there should be something

05:54.210 --> 05:56.129
within the arms of it
coming this way.

05:56.129 --> 05:57.960
Right. Yeah.
I want you to dig There

05:57.960 --> 05:58.960
soon as you can.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.729
-All right, see you.
Okay.

06:00.729 --> 06:02.669
NARRATOR:
Although the team

06:02.669 --> 06:04.099
is more than encouraged

06:04.099 --> 06:07.370
by the dating analysis of the
U-shaped structure and slipway,

06:07.370 --> 06:09.520
they have less than a week left

06:09.520 --> 06:13.080
before they must shut down
operations for the winter.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.800
We are absolutely
running out of time.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.330
The weather's closing in,
our permit's about to run out,

06:17.330 --> 06:19.439
we're very fatigued,

06:19.439 --> 06:21.860
and we still haven't
got back far enough

06:21.860 --> 06:25.289
to follow all these structures
to where they sort of converge.

06:25.289 --> 06:26.289
RICK:
I agree,

06:26.289 --> 06:27.669
but we still have
a window of time,

06:27.669 --> 06:30.169
and I'm hoping that
we'll get some answers yet.

06:32.669 --> 06:33.830
LAIRD:
Whoa...!

06:33.830 --> 06:34.990
(indistinct chatter)

06:37.390 --> 06:38.549
Holy crap!

06:39.849 --> 06:42.359
Billy, we've got something here.

06:50.059 --> 06:51.350
What does That
look like, Laird?

06:51.650 --> 06:56.289
Well...

06:56.289 --> 06:57.789
It's clay. There's
another board down there,

06:57.789 --> 07:00.509
but it's clay
that's coming out in chunks.

07:00.509 --> 07:01.509
Wow.

07:01.509 --> 07:06.539
See? Look here.
There's another board here.

07:06.539 --> 07:09.259
I think this one's
pulled out a bit.

07:09.259 --> 07:10.400
All right.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.309
And then we have the third one.

07:13.309 --> 07:16.399
They're not just loose boards,
that's for sure.

07:16.399 --> 07:17.899
-No, because there was clay
on both sides.

07:17.899 --> 07:19.029
-It's well packed

07:19.029 --> 07:21.069
with clay behind it.
Yeah. Yeah.

07:21.069 --> 07:23.819
RICK:
Why put the clay in back?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.270
NARRATOR:
Wooden boards?

07:26.270 --> 07:28.409
Packed with clay?

07:28.409 --> 07:31.550
Could it have been put here
by searchers in 1850

07:31.550 --> 07:33.379
trying to block off
the flood tunnel

07:33.379 --> 07:36.659
that leads directly
to the original Money Pit?

07:36.659 --> 07:40.119
Or was it done even earlier

07:40.119 --> 07:42.389
by those who constructed
the flood tunnel

07:42.389 --> 07:44.279
and the Money Pit
treasure shaft?

07:44.279 --> 07:47.169
I have no idea
what to make of it.

07:47.169 --> 07:49.240
There is such
an incredible amount

07:49.240 --> 07:51.869
of structures
just in this one defined area,

07:51.869 --> 07:54.210
where all the busywork
has been done.

07:54.210 --> 07:56.440
BILLY: Yeah.
-It's-it's right here.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.289
You know? Well, I-I'd say dig
the front of this, follow it,

08:00.289 --> 08:02.430
see-see What happens.
Yeah.

08:19.930 --> 08:20.969
Got an upright.

08:20.969 --> 08:21.970
CHARLES:
Whoa.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.560
That's a big one.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.360
LAIRD:
Yeah.

08:26.460 --> 08:30.009
That's one of the biggest ones
we've seen yet.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.140
LAIRD:
Yeah, and it continues.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.030
RICK:
Which is confusing,

08:34.030 --> 08:35.220
because the brace,

08:35.220 --> 08:40.100
then, behind means the force
was coming this way.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.260
Yeah. So were they looking

08:42.260 --> 08:44.700
for the converging point
of the flood tunnels?

08:44.700 --> 08:47.590
And maybe that's the reason
for the heavy clays was to try

08:47.590 --> 08:50.850
to block it going back into
the converging point, maybe.

08:50.850 --> 08:51.850
I-I don't know.

08:51.850 --> 08:53.430
RICK:
We've come to the belief that,

08:53.430 --> 08:54.430
as we proceed,

08:54.430 --> 08:57.270
the most interesting structures
will be in the upland.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.280
You know,
that's bearing some fruit,

08:59.280 --> 09:02.080
because we've found what
we're calling the mystery wall,

09:02.080 --> 09:05.060
and we certainly need
to continue digging.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.830
Well, all we can do
is track it back.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.180
We've got a lot of work to do.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.570
LAIRD:
And not a lot of time.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.370
MARTY:
Well, what do you make of this?

09:16.070 --> 09:19.970
NARRATOR: At Smith's Cove, on
the eastern end of Oak Island,

09:19.970 --> 09:23.300
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with members

09:23.300 --> 09:26.530
of their team, are continuing
their investigation

09:26.530 --> 09:28.440
of a mysterious wooden wall

09:28.440 --> 09:30.890
found buried beneath
the edge of the beach.

09:30.890 --> 09:33.860
A wall that sits
right in the area

09:33.860 --> 09:35.440
where they are searching
for evidence

09:35.440 --> 09:37.210
of a man-made flood tunnel

09:37.210 --> 09:40.770
designed to feed seawater
deep into the Money Pit.

09:40.770 --> 09:43.270
RICK:
Charles, from a historical

09:43.270 --> 09:44.370
perspective,

09:44.370 --> 09:45.370
no record of this?

09:45.370 --> 09:47.530
No. No, no record at all.

09:47.530 --> 09:49.580
I think the fact that
we have these vertical cuts

09:49.580 --> 09:53.550
has to predate Restall,
so this goes back quite a ways.

09:53.550 --> 09:56.300
CRAIG:
You can see they dug down

09:56.300 --> 09:57.300
at least this length

09:57.300 --> 09:59.070
into the sea level
for some reason.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.870
MARTY:
Well, then if all that

10:00.870 --> 10:02.580
makes sense,
back there ought to be

10:02.580 --> 10:05.310
-the flood tunnel, right?
-That's what I'm wondering.

10:05.310 --> 10:06.960
And the water's coming
from there.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.741
RICK:
But here's the curious thing,

10:08.741 --> 10:09.741
though.

10:09.741 --> 10:12.200
We marked down the middle
of the U-shaped structure,

10:12.200 --> 10:15.090
the Billy's wall,
that rock formation,

10:15.090 --> 10:16.860
this one and this one.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.600
See those flags on the sheet?

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
MARTY:
Yes.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.620
All in one line right here.

10:22.620 --> 10:23.810
Great. It's another mystery.

10:23.810 --> 10:24.950
LAIRD: Absolutely.
We keep finding structures.

10:24.950 --> 10:28.370
GARY:
The more we dig, the more chance

10:28.370 --> 10:30.020
we've got of finding something.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.390
-Yeah, I know.
RICK: Whenever you can make

10:32.390 --> 10:34.940
an observation
that one structure

10:34.940 --> 10:36.770
might be aligned
with another structure,

10:36.770 --> 10:40.120
your first thought is: well,
there's some relationship here.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.040
Some of these might be
part of the work

10:43.040 --> 10:45.660
to introduce water
into the Money Pit.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.030
CRAIG:
Looks like there's

10:47.030 --> 10:48.690
a higher board up there.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.180
Does it keep going there, guys?

10:51.180 --> 10:53.861
CRAIG:
Like it was all of a sudden

10:53.861 --> 10:55.250
gotten a lot more rocks.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.040
Isn't that something?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.320
That would be
an effective sealant.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.030
RICK:
If that doesn't seal off water,

11:02.030 --> 11:03.940
nothing will.
-MARTY: And you know what,

11:03.940 --> 11:04.940
looks like there's clay

11:04.940 --> 11:07.130
packed behind here, too.

11:07.130 --> 11:11.950
How about taking some
right here, Billy?

11:11.950 --> 11:14.700
NARRATOR:
More packed clay?

11:14.700 --> 11:16.870
When the Money Pit
was excavated

11:16.870 --> 11:20.060
to a 90-foot depth in 1804,

11:20.060 --> 11:23.460
in addition to platforms
of oak logs every ten feet,

11:23.460 --> 11:26.320
they also discovered
a large amount of packed clay

11:26.320 --> 11:30.660
at the 40-foot level, likely
placed there to protect the pit

11:30.660 --> 11:33.800
and whatever was buried below
from groundwater.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.420
Could the discovery
of packed clay

11:36.420 --> 11:38.620
around the mysterious
beach wall

11:38.620 --> 11:42.470
be more evidence that Rick,
Marty, Craig and the team

11:42.470 --> 11:43.800
have discovered workings

11:43.800 --> 11:46.770
connected to the original
pit's construction?

11:46.770 --> 11:49.470
What is that?

11:49.470 --> 11:54.830
There's a wall here.

11:54.830 --> 12:02.100
GARY:
Oh, man. Another day,

12:02.100 --> 12:03.100
another structure.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.540
Yeah, it's coming at an angle.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.650
GARY:
I told you, the further

12:06.650 --> 12:07.650
you go digging,

12:07.650 --> 12:10.310
the more structures we'll find.

12:10.310 --> 12:13.980
NARRATOR:
A second wooden wall?

12:13.980 --> 12:17.400
Just five feet behind
the first?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
Could the team be close

12:18.400 --> 12:21.330
to finally uncovering
the main flood tunnel?

12:21.330 --> 12:24.130
RICK:
Well, all we can do is

12:24.130 --> 12:26.340
track it back,
see what happens.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.780
NARRATOR:
After a long day of exploration

12:33.780 --> 12:34.880
at Smith's Cove...

12:34.880 --> 12:36.910
Hey, how are you doing?

12:36.910 --> 12:38.090
How are you guys doing?
Howdy. Howdy.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.760
NARRATOR:
...Rick, Marty and Craig,

12:39.760 --> 12:42.070
along with Charles Barkhouse,

12:42.070 --> 12:44.790
meet with representatives
from Eagle Canada

12:44.790 --> 12:47.380
to check on the progress
of an operation,

12:47.380 --> 12:49.110
which they hope will identify

12:49.110 --> 12:51.600
any large objects--
or structures--

12:51.600 --> 12:54.040
buried deep beneath
the mysterious,

12:54.040 --> 12:55.970
triangle-shaped swamp.

12:55.970 --> 12:56.970
We're ready to go.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.550
We got about 400 shots
to, uh, shoot tonight.

12:59.550 --> 13:01.870
So that's why we have,
actually, eight shooters.

13:01.870 --> 13:03.160
Where are we starting
and where are we ending?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.201
ALEX G.:
So, uh, we're going to start

13:05.201 --> 13:07.800
on the east side.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.620
We should reach
the peninsula tonight.

13:09.620 --> 13:14.260
Okay, everybody steady up.
Here it comes. Steady up.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.330
NARRATOR:
One week ago,

13:16.330 --> 13:17.780
the Laginas and their partners

13:17.780 --> 13:21.160
commissioned Eagle Canada to
begin an underground survey

13:21.160 --> 13:23.790
of the swamp area using
a process known

13:23.790 --> 13:24.990
as "seismic testing."

13:24.990 --> 13:28.620
This technology involves
creating sound waves

13:28.620 --> 13:30.070
below the earth's surface

13:30.070 --> 13:32.530
by detonating explosive
charges,

13:32.530 --> 13:36.350
each containg 20 grams
of dynamite.

13:36.350 --> 13:38.100
(explosion)

13:38.100 --> 13:42.090
As more than 2,000 total
charges are remotely set off,

13:42.090 --> 13:44.540
the sound waves that they
generate will be measured

13:44.540 --> 13:48.650
by geophone recorders to create
images of any anomalies

13:48.650 --> 13:51.630
which could include man-made
objects and structures.

13:52.730 --> 13:53.730
So are we ready?

13:53.730 --> 13:54.930
Yeah. Let's get going.

13:54.930 --> 13:56.530
JEFF:
81-56.

13:56.530 --> 13:58.130
(beeping)

14:03.430 --> 14:06.710
MARTY:
Oh, yeah, that was a splatter.

14:06.710 --> 14:08.950
NARRATOR:
Due to sound interference

14:08.950 --> 14:10.930
created by heavy winds,

14:10.930 --> 14:12.940
which have grown more frequent
during the day

14:12.940 --> 14:14.860
as the winter season
approaches,

14:14.860 --> 14:17.550
the Eagle Canada team
has chosen

14:17.550 --> 14:20.500
to continue their work at night
when the ambient noise

14:20.500 --> 14:22.760
above ground will be
less likely

14:22.760 --> 14:25.510
to contaminate their results.

14:25.510 --> 14:27.460
RICK:
So when you shoot

14:27.460 --> 14:29.640
these lines tonight,

14:29.640 --> 14:30.890
are you a third done,

14:30.890 --> 14:31.890
a quarter done?
Counting What you already have

14:31.890 --> 14:35.140
in the can, you should be
about half, shouldn't you?

14:35.140 --> 14:36.140
JARED:
Yeah, we would be -if we

14:36.140 --> 14:37.140
shot everything we had tonight,

14:37.140 --> 14:39.500
We would be close to half shot.
Yep.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.390
RICK:
Would you see disturbed ground,

14:41.390 --> 14:44.240
like, if a channel had been dug
through the middle of the swamp?

14:44.240 --> 14:46.390
would you see that?
-They'd likely see that.

14:46.390 --> 14:47.390
ALEX G.:
Yeah, we're hoping

14:47.390 --> 14:48.390
imaging pretty good

14:48.390 --> 14:51.340
at 20 feet and below.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.180
So we believed in our science.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.470
We were confident, but now we
are even more confident

14:55.470 --> 14:57.430
that we'll get you
something good.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.440
NARRATOR:
Although seismic technology

15:00.440 --> 15:02.810
was originally developed
to map features

15:02.810 --> 15:06.180
located miles deep beneath
the earth's surface,

15:06.180 --> 15:08.860
Eagle Canada has pioneered
a technique

15:08.860 --> 15:12.810
that can obtain seismic data
at much shallower depths.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.900
MARTY:
Eagle Canada is confident

15:15.900 --> 15:18.779
they can image even better than
they did in the Money Pit.

15:18.779 --> 15:21.510
If there is some kind of massive
structure in the swamp,

15:21.510 --> 15:25.220
which Rick believes is possible,
uh, I think we'll see it.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.110
I'll make a prediction
right now.

15:27.110 --> 15:29.210
Whatever you end up shooting out
out here,

15:29.210 --> 15:31.740
it'll probably be something
we're not thinking about.

15:31.740 --> 15:33.720
RICK:
There'll be some strange stories

15:33.720 --> 15:35.050
about Oak Island tonight.

15:35.050 --> 15:38.240
Strange lights And-And sounds.
Yeah.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.350
MARTY (chuckling):
If there's something here

15:41.350 --> 15:46.279
we ought to find it.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.490
(whooping)

15:47.490 --> 15:53.060
NARRATOR:
As a new day begins

15:53.060 --> 15:54.310
on Oak Island...

15:54.310 --> 15:56.390
BRUCE: Greetings.
-MARTY: Hello, gentlemen.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.640
How's everybody doing?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.050
NARRATOR:
...brothers Rick

15:59.050 --> 16:00.440
and Marty Lagina,

16:00.440 --> 16:02.630
along with members
of their team,

16:02.630 --> 16:05.060
have welcomed treasure hunter
Justin Cannady

16:05.060 --> 16:09.220
and researcher Bruce Lindahl
to the war room.

16:09.220 --> 16:11.100
Also joining them
via video conference

16:11.100 --> 16:12.810
from his home in California

16:12.810 --> 16:15.140
is Bruce's brother
Cort Lindahl.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.040
-Hi, Cort.
-Hello, Cort.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.040
(overlapping greetings)

16:18.040 --> 16:20.370
NARRATOR:
As an author, researcher,

16:20.370 --> 16:22.520
and professional land surveyor,

16:22.520 --> 16:25.130
Cort Lindahl has spent
more than 40 years studying

16:25.130 --> 16:29.390
the history and archeology of
both Europe and North America.

16:29.390 --> 16:32.120
He believes he has made
an important connection

16:32.120 --> 16:33.839
between the work
of Rick's friend,

16:33.839 --> 16:37.310
the last author Zena Halpern,
and his own research

16:37.310 --> 16:39.310
chronicling the possible
connections

16:39.310 --> 16:42.700
of American's Founding Fathers
to the Knights Templar.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.640
CORT:
Zena Halpern did a great job

16:45.640 --> 16:47.970
exposing all of this.

16:47.970 --> 16:50.600
And, uh, all of her research
may well apply

16:50.600 --> 16:53.980
to what we're talking about
in many different ways.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.770
MARTY: How so?
-CORT: Well, you know,

16:56.770 --> 16:57.920
first of all,

16:57.920 --> 17:01.610
the-the map that Zena Halpern
supplied you all.

17:01.610 --> 17:04.220
Right.
-From examing the map itself,

17:04.220 --> 17:07.199
I think that map could serve
as a bridge

17:07.199 --> 17:09.919
that really does connect
Oak Island

17:09.919 --> 17:13.319
to those French mysteries.

17:13.319 --> 17:17.319
NARRATOR:
Two years ago,

17:17.319 --> 17:19.970
Zena Halpern presented Rick
and the team

17:19.970 --> 17:21.429
with what she believed to be

17:21.429 --> 17:23.990
a transcription
of an ancient French map

17:23.990 --> 17:26.930
showing possible treasure sites
on Oak Island.

17:35.230 --> 17:36.519
NARRATOR:
Although the actual authorship

17:36.519 --> 17:37.909
of the map is unknown,

17:37.909 --> 17:40.410
it references the name
Rochefoucauld,

17:40.410 --> 17:43.559
a French noble family
with direct links

17:43.559 --> 17:46.429
stretching back to the days
of the Knights Templar.

17:46.429 --> 17:49.519
The Rochefoucauld family
even has connections

17:49.519 --> 17:53.220
to the Duc d'Anville
and the possible construction

17:53.220 --> 17:56.600
or visit to the Money Pit.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.410
Yeah.

17:58.410 --> 18:02.059
I found eight pages of a ship--
what looks like a ship's log.

18:02.059 --> 18:03.580
NARRATOR:
One year ago,

18:03.580 --> 18:05.480
Doug Crowell found a transcript

18:05.480 --> 18:08.499
taken from an
18th century ship's log,

18:08.499 --> 18:10.610
reportedly authored by a member

18:10.610 --> 18:13.970
of the 1746 naval expedition
to Nova Scotia,

18:13.970 --> 18:18.509
led by the French admiral known
as the Duc d'Anville,

18:18.509 --> 18:20.200
and which described
the construction

18:20.200 --> 18:22.539
of a treasure shaft
eerily similar

18:22.539 --> 18:27.740
to the original Money Pit.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.740
a secret entrance

18:28.740 --> 18:29.789
by a tunnel from the shore."

18:29.789 --> 18:32.389
I mean, it fits
in every aspect.

18:32.389 --> 18:35.050
Interestingly enough,
the Duc d'Anville,

18:35.050 --> 18:38.919
his real name was
Jean-Baptiste Louis Fr\d\ric

18:38.919 --> 18:40.280
de Rochefoucauld.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.340
CORT:
Louis, uh,

18:42.340 --> 18:44.049
Alexandre Rochefoucauld

18:44.049 --> 18:45.950
was the son
of the Duc d'Anville

18:45.950 --> 18:49.289
that lost his life
on the d'Anville expedition.

18:49.289 --> 18:53.059
And Alexandre is a very
interesting character

18:53.059 --> 18:56.139
because of his associations
with Thomas Jefferson

18:56.139 --> 19:01.049
and Benjamin Franklin.

19:01.049 --> 19:03.659
There is, uh, some degree
of probability

19:03.659 --> 19:06.370
that Louis Alexandre
Rochefoucauld,

19:06.370 --> 19:08.649
in his friendship
with Benjamin Franklin

19:08.649 --> 19:11.460
and Thomas Jefferson,
may have actually told them

19:11.460 --> 19:14.340
of Oak Island
or whatever secret was there.

19:14.340 --> 19:16.549
NARRATOR:
Benjamin Franklin?

19:16.549 --> 19:17.820
Thomas Jefferson?

19:17.820 --> 19:19.850
Two of the Founding Fathers

19:19.850 --> 19:22.259
of the United States
of America.

19:22.259 --> 19:24.070
BRUCE:
They could have had part

19:24.070 --> 19:26.929
of the treasure from Oak Island

19:26.929 --> 19:30.210
as a way to finance the war,

19:30.210 --> 19:32.700
and help, you know,
establish the new country.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.639
MARTY: Holy smokes.
Wow.

19:35.639 --> 19:38.379
CORT:
I've been amazed

19:38.379 --> 19:40.110
by seeing all the connections

19:40.110 --> 19:43.230
between the first families
of Virginia and New England

19:43.230 --> 19:46.730
and these French patriot
families that all assisted us

19:46.730 --> 19:50.669
in the Revolutionary War.

19:50.669 --> 19:53.049
Throughout Thomas Jefferson's
time in France,

19:53.049 --> 19:55.409
there's some chances
that he was even initiated

19:55.409 --> 19:57.999
into a form of Knights Templar
in France

19:57.999 --> 20:00.460
that the Rochefoucaulds
and others

20:00.460 --> 20:03.820
may have been members of
at that time.

20:03.820 --> 20:05.480
BRUCE:
All these families

20:05.480 --> 20:06.489
were all involved

20:06.489 --> 20:08.620
in secret societies
like the Templars.

20:08.620 --> 20:09.620
MARTY: Right.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.999
-That's true.
Like the Freemasons.

20:11.999 --> 20:15.549
CORT:
We know Freemasons

20:15.549 --> 20:17.179
who were Knights Templar,

20:17.179 --> 20:21.700
that they had a hand in the
creation of the United States.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.759
And that also in turn links us
back to George Washington,

20:24.759 --> 20:27.399
who was a Freemason.
Yeah.

20:27.399 --> 20:30.809
These French families who came
to settle in Nova Scotia,

20:30.809 --> 20:31.809
actually corresponding

20:31.809 --> 20:34.899
with George Washington
prior to the war

20:34.899 --> 20:38.179
to try to convince him that
Nova Scotia should be part

20:38.179 --> 20:39.619
of the American colonies.

20:39.619 --> 20:42.080
And indeed,
Nova Scotia may have even

20:42.080 --> 20:44.399
been planned to be
the 13th colony.

20:44.399 --> 20:45.879
MARTY:
That's interesting.

20:45.879 --> 20:48.869
CORT:
We know, uh, the number 13

20:48.869 --> 20:49.869
in the colonies

20:49.869 --> 20:51.509
came up because
they split Vermont

20:51.509 --> 20:53.039
and New Hampshire in half

20:53.039 --> 20:55.220
to make that number possible.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.220
That's remarkable.

20:56.220 --> 20:59.420
JACK:
Why was the number 13

20:59.420 --> 21:01.730
so important
to the Founding Fathers?

21:01.730 --> 21:04.340
I believe that number 13
was important

21:04.340 --> 21:06.690
because it has kind
of sacred overtones

21:06.690 --> 21:09.740
that we do associate
with Friday the 13th

21:09.740 --> 21:11.450
and the story
of the dissolution

21:11.450 --> 21:14.080
of the Knights Templar.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.809
NARRATOR:
By the beginning

21:16.809 --> 21:17.809
of the 14th century,

21:17.809 --> 21:20.950
the military order
of the Knights Templar

21:20.950 --> 21:23.389
had grown incredibly powerful
and wealthy,

21:23.389 --> 21:25.820
fighting to protect
the interests of Christians

21:25.820 --> 21:28.840
in Europe and the Middle East
during the Crusades.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.879
But after falling into
great debt to the Templars,

21:31.879 --> 21:35.279
King Philip IV of France
conspired

21:35.279 --> 21:38.639
to have the order
falsely charged with heresy

21:38.639 --> 21:39.700
and disbanded.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.700
On Friday the 13th, 1307,

21:42.700 --> 21:45.869
thousands in the order
were arrested,

21:45.869 --> 21:48.629
tortured and executed.

21:48.629 --> 21:52.899
Although a large number
of survivors

21:52.899 --> 21:55.080
were known to have escaped
to Scotland,

21:55.080 --> 21:57.960
there are many who believe
that they eventually set sail

21:57.960 --> 22:00.210
for the New World
with ships loaded up

22:00.210 --> 22:02.590
with treasure
and sacred objects taken

22:02.590 --> 22:05.130
from their Crusades
in the Holy Land.

22:05.130 --> 22:08.289
Is it possible
that the Templar treasure

22:08.289 --> 22:10.739
was eventually deposited
on Oak Island

22:10.739 --> 22:12.629
by members of
the Rochefoucauld family?

22:12.629 --> 22:16.190
And if so, could a portion
of this treasure

22:16.190 --> 22:18.350
have been offered
to George Washington

22:18.350 --> 22:19.850
and the Founding Fathers

22:19.850 --> 22:21.720
as a means of helping
to finance

22:21.720 --> 22:23.250
the American Revolution?

22:23.250 --> 22:26.299
BRUCE:
Do you think there was a time

22:26.299 --> 22:28.509
when Washington actually
may have come

22:28.509 --> 22:31.480
to Nova Scotia and Oak Island?

22:31.480 --> 22:32.480
I-I'm not so sure

22:32.480 --> 22:34.260
that George Washington
ever came there,

22:34.260 --> 22:37.220
but we do know that as, uh,
Doug was telling me

22:37.220 --> 22:39.749
about that, uh,
Appeal to Heaven design

22:39.749 --> 22:41.500
that might be on Oak Island.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.480
I see. Is that what you're
referring to right there?

22:43.480 --> 22:45.330
-What's...?
CORT: the pine tree design?

22:45.330 --> 22:46.419
-Yes. What's...
Yes.

22:46.419 --> 22:47.419
Where does this appear

22:47.419 --> 22:48.940
and where does this come from?

22:48.940 --> 22:50.249
DOUG:
Appeal to Heaven.

22:50.249 --> 22:53.140
It's the belief
in the right to revolt.

22:53.140 --> 22:55.409
NARRATOR:
Although presented

22:55.409 --> 22:56.520
in various forms,

22:56.520 --> 23:00.120
the "Tree Flag,"
or "Appeal to Heaven" flag,

23:00.120 --> 23:02.639
was commissioned
by General George Washington

23:02.639 --> 23:04.239
when he became
commander in chief

23:04.239 --> 23:07.440
of the Continental Army
in October 1775,

23:07.440 --> 23:10.799
and came to symbolize
colonial resistance

23:10.799 --> 23:14.070
toward Great Britain during
the American Revolution.

23:14.070 --> 23:17.549
Well, there is something
like that.

23:17.549 --> 23:19.350
PAUL:
It's in that, uh,

23:19.350 --> 23:20.860
-stone that says "Evan" on it...
Yeah.

23:20.860 --> 23:21.860
...that's on the north side
of the island.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.090
I think it's towards
the Boulderless Beach,

23:24.090 --> 23:26.639
but Charles could tell you
exactly where it is.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.259
Yeah, it's down
on the shore, yeah.

23:29.259 --> 23:30.639
NARRATOR:
Located on the northeastern

23:30.639 --> 23:32.330
shore of Oak Island,

23:32.330 --> 23:34.249
the so-called Evan's Stone

23:34.249 --> 23:38.159
is a large boulder upon which
several words have been carved,

23:38.159 --> 23:41.409
along with what appears to be
a branch or tree.

23:41.409 --> 23:44.619
But is it possible
this crude symbol

23:44.619 --> 23:47.299
has a more profound meaning,

23:47.299 --> 23:49.239
one connected
to the United States'

23:49.239 --> 23:51.659
most famous Founding Father

23:51.659 --> 23:53.179
and first president,

23:53.179 --> 23:54.749
George Washington?

23:54.749 --> 23:57.299
So, you guys want
to go see this stone?

23:57.299 --> 23:58.989
Okay.
-Yeah, I'd love to see it.

23:58.989 --> 23:59.989
Yeah.

23:59.989 --> 24:00.989
MARTY:
Okay, let's go out

24:00.989 --> 24:06.740
in the field.

24:06.740 --> 24:10.039
Following their meeting
in the war room,

24:10.039 --> 24:12.720
Marty Lagina
and historian Doug Crowell,

24:12.720 --> 24:15.970
along with Justin Cannady
and Bruce Lindahl,

24:15.970 --> 24:18.139
head to Lot 14,

24:18.139 --> 24:20.419
located on the northeast end
of Oak Island.

24:20.419 --> 24:21.419
JUSTIN:
Beautiful out here.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.700
MARTY:
The stone's down there.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.639
Watch your step.
This stuff is slippery.

24:25.639 --> 24:28.210
They are investigating
if a carving found

24:28.210 --> 24:29.850
on the face of a large stone

24:29.850 --> 24:32.090
on the island's northern shore

24:32.090 --> 24:35.549
may actually depict
the Appeal to Heaven flag,

24:35.549 --> 24:39.139
a battle flag commissioned
by General George Washington

24:39.139 --> 24:41.299
during the American Revolution.

24:41.299 --> 24:46.149
MARTY:
There you go.

24:46.149 --> 24:48.580
JUSTIN:
Wow.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.149
MARTY:
That's it.

24:50.149 --> 24:51.580
JUSTIN:
I don't know.

24:51.580 --> 24:53.100
This is really strange.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.809
DOUG:
It does look like a tree though,

24:55.809 --> 24:57.100
doesn't it?

24:57.100 --> 25:00.450
JUSTIN:
It does look like a tree.

25:00.450 --> 25:02.830
BRUCE: Yeah.
MARTY: Wow.

25:02.830 --> 25:05.809
One, two, three, four, five,

25:05.809 --> 25:08.789
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

25:08.789 --> 25:10.570
11, 12, 13.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.960
JUSTIN:
Right. That's crazy

25:12.960 --> 25:14.940
that it's got 13,

25:14.940 --> 25:17.080
just like the picture does.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.919
NARRATOR:
Is this stone carving of a tree

25:20.919 --> 25:23.460
featuring 13 branches proof

25:23.460 --> 25:27.909
that Cort Lindahl's
incredible theory is true?

25:27.909 --> 25:29.231
Could some
of the United States'

25:29.231 --> 25:31.289
most prominent founders,

25:31.289 --> 25:34.370
such as Thomas Jefferson,
Benjamin Franklin,

25:34.370 --> 25:36.639
and George Washington,

25:36.639 --> 25:40.029
be connected
to the Oak Island mystery?

25:40.029 --> 25:42.669
MARTY:
Cort Lindahl and Justin

25:42.669 --> 25:43.669
and Bruce think

25:43.669 --> 25:45.499
there may be
some connection between

25:45.499 --> 25:48.649
Oak Island and maybe
the fledgling United States.

25:48.649 --> 25:50.109
There's a symbol of a tree

25:50.109 --> 25:51.809
on the eastern end
of the island

25:51.809 --> 25:54.470
that was significant
to George Washington.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.850
That's a connection.
That opens up my thinking

25:56.850 --> 25:57.999
about what happened here.

25:57.999 --> 26:00.499
Thank you for coming out.
Appreciate it.

26:00.499 --> 26:02.980
Been a pleasure.
-JUSTIN: Yes, sir.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.820
Been a pleasure, man.

26:04.820 --> 26:07.149
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon,

26:07.149 --> 26:11.230
Rick and Marty Lagina head
to the Oak Island swamp,

26:11.230 --> 26:13.860
where the team from
Eagle Canada are completing

26:13.860 --> 26:17.309
their extensive seismic survey
of the entire area.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.809
There they are.

26:18.809 --> 26:21.299
-Hey, how you doing?
Good.

26:21.299 --> 26:23.299
(chuckles)
you got It

26:23.299 --> 26:24.519
pretty well worked up here.

26:24.519 --> 26:26.139
Good morning.
-Hey. Jared, how you doing?

26:26.139 --> 26:27.789
Yeah, we shot everything
last night.

26:27.789 --> 26:29.659
So, how's the data quality look?

26:29.659 --> 26:31.820
-Well, we only see
the raw data from here,

26:31.820 --> 26:32.820
Right.

26:32.820 --> 26:33.820
and the raw data
looks really good.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.500
So we'll see what the power
of the stack does

26:35.500 --> 26:37.090
when We put
everything together...

26:37.090 --> 26:38.090
Right.

26:38.090 --> 26:39.090
-...and we send it
to processing.

26:39.090 --> 26:40.090
How long before

26:40.090 --> 26:41.090
we might see something?

26:41.090 --> 26:43.499
I'm guessing the processor's
gonna need about a month.

26:43.499 --> 26:45.249
Then, after that,
Jeremy's gonna need

26:45.249 --> 26:47.059
about two weeks to actually give

26:47.059 --> 26:48.720
his report.
Okay.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.649
NARRATOR:
Although Rick and Marty

26:50.649 --> 26:52.450
are excited by the news

26:52.450 --> 26:54.519
that the team from Eagle Canada

26:54.519 --> 26:57.460
has completed their seismic
survey of the swamp,

26:57.460 --> 27:00.119
they will have to wait
until next year

27:00.119 --> 27:01.780
to act on the results.

27:01.780 --> 27:05.049
All right, guys. Well, again,
thank you very much.

27:05.049 --> 27:06.809
-Yeah, man. Thanks.
It was a pleasure.

27:06.809 --> 27:08.690
Safe-Safe travels.

27:08.690 --> 27:11.019
NARRATOR:
As Rick and Marty conclude

27:11.019 --> 27:12.019
their meeting

27:12.019 --> 27:13.489
with the Eagle Canada team...

27:13.489 --> 27:15.799
BILLY:
I may try to go up this way.

27:15.799 --> 27:17.249
NARRATOR:
...at Smith's Cove...

27:17.249 --> 27:19.179
LAIRD:
I'm gonna just grab the shovel

27:19.179 --> 27:20.419
and dig away a bit.

27:20.419 --> 27:22.919
...area archaeologist
Laird Niven

27:22.919 --> 27:26.659
and heavy equipment operator
Billy Gerhardt are continuing

27:26.659 --> 27:28.879
to excavate the beach area

27:28.879 --> 27:30.590
in search
of the main flood tunnel,

27:30.590 --> 27:33.600
which, if found,
could lead the team directly

27:33.600 --> 27:35.309
to the original Money Pit.

27:35.309 --> 27:37.649
LAIRD:
Holy crap!

27:37.649 --> 27:40.779
You got it there.

27:40.779 --> 27:44.679
-BILLY: What's that?
the wall.

27:44.679 --> 27:47.590
BILLY:
That's a third one then, right?

27:47.590 --> 27:48.590
Yeah.

27:48.590 --> 27:50.259
-There's this one here.
Yeah.

27:50.259 --> 27:52.059
And then there-- but then
there's the one outside.

27:52.059 --> 27:54.710
LAIRD:
Then there's a parallel one.

27:54.710 --> 27:58.119
-That's number three.
Yeah.

27:58.119 --> 27:59.869
-It's definitely running
parallel to this.

27:59.869 --> 28:00.869
This one

28:00.869 --> 28:02.059
-we didn't know about.
No.

28:02.059 --> 28:04.979
NARRATOR:
A third wall

28:04.979 --> 28:07.529
found just a few feet
from the other walls

28:07.529 --> 28:11.210
discovered just one day ago
at Smith's Cove?

28:11.210 --> 28:12.570
Could the team
have found evidence

28:12.570 --> 28:14.389
of the main flood tunnel
that feeds

28:14.389 --> 28:16.850
seawater into the Money Pit?

28:16.850 --> 28:20.409
Continue to uncover it.

28:20.409 --> 28:23.159
BILLY:
See how deep it goes.

28:27.859 --> 28:30.690
Uh, it's a box.

28:30.690 --> 28:31.940
There's a board on this end.
Look.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.009
Got something here.

28:33.009 --> 28:39.799
MARTY:
All right, what do we got here?

28:39.799 --> 28:41.179
BILLY:
Well,

28:41.179 --> 28:44.590
we're hoping
you can maybe tell us.

28:44.590 --> 28:45.840
MARTY:
All right, I will.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.830
I'm coming down here
to tell you what this is.

28:48.830 --> 28:51.700
Okay, first tell me
where we were yesterday.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.019
-Here, right?
Yeah.

28:53.019 --> 28:54.019
We saw the front

28:54.019 --> 28:55.029
of this wall yesterday.

28:55.029 --> 28:57.889
So, our logic was
to dig behind it,

28:57.889 --> 28:59.299
you know, and profile it down.

28:59.299 --> 29:00.809
But then there was another wall,

29:00.809 --> 29:01.809
which turns out to be

29:01.809 --> 29:02.809
a shaft.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.740
MARTY:
Is it a shaft?

29:05.740 --> 29:07.220
LAIRD:
We assume so,

29:07.220 --> 29:08.279
Yeah.
Looks Like

29:08.279 --> 29:10.570
a sluice box or something,
doesn't it?

29:10.570 --> 29:13.269
NARRATOR:
A sluice box?

29:13.269 --> 29:15.379
Traditionally made of wood
or metal,

29:15.379 --> 29:18.809
a sluice box is a device
designed to channel

29:18.809 --> 29:22.769
and regulate the flow of water.

29:22.769 --> 29:24.879
Could the team have found
a structure

29:24.879 --> 29:27.460
that was put here
by previous searchers

29:27.460 --> 29:29.200
as a means
of attempting to redirect

29:29.200 --> 29:30.950
the flow of ocean water away

29:30.950 --> 29:33.429
from a flood tunnel
guarding the Money Pit?

29:33.429 --> 29:36.470
Or could it be much older

29:36.470 --> 29:37.929
and actually be a part

29:37.929 --> 29:40.269
of the booby-trapped
flooding system itself?

29:40.269 --> 29:43.159
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

29:43.159 --> 29:44.750
You can't finish
your dang job here

29:44.750 --> 29:46.309
'cause you keep finding stuff.

29:46.309 --> 29:47.780
BILLY: This is the trouble.
Yeah.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.720
BILLY: This is the trouble.
-Tell you what, Rick,

29:49.720 --> 29:51.919
whatever that is,
it's beautifully done, isn't it?

29:51.919 --> 29:52.919
Artfully done.

29:52.919 --> 29:54.609
MARTY:
That could be paneling

29:54.609 --> 29:56.039
in your study.

29:56.039 --> 29:57.999
Those boards are thicker
than these though.

29:57.999 --> 29:58.999
LAIRD: Yeah.
-MARTY: Oh, yeah.

29:58.999 --> 29:59.999
-RICK: So we've got

29:59.999 --> 30:02.600
three structures
in very close proximity.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.240
Someone was endeavoring
to do something substantial.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.240
Needs more digging.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.249
And until that happens,
I-I don't think

30:09.249 --> 30:13.330
we can assess properly
what this may mean.

30:13.330 --> 30:15.639
NARRATOR:
With another mysterious

30:15.639 --> 30:18.320
but also promising discovery,

30:18.320 --> 30:23.210
Rick, Marty and the team
can only draw one conclusion.

30:23.210 --> 30:26.950
Their investigation of
Smith's Cove is far from over.

30:26.950 --> 30:30.470
However, there is
another unfortunate reality.

30:30.470 --> 30:34.309
Their time to explore
on the island this year

30:34.309 --> 30:36.019
has come to an end.

30:36.019 --> 30:38.049
Guys,
here's the unfortunate truth.

30:38.049 --> 30:41.220
And facts are stubborn.
We're out of time this season.

30:41.220 --> 30:43.309
Everything's closing in. We're
running out of permit time.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.760
We're running out of weather.
We're basically done.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.530
Let's get back to the war room
and discuss this.

30:47.530 --> 30:50.159
-Let's assemble the guys.
BILLY: Yep.

30:50.159 --> 30:53.229
RICK:
Let's go.

30:53.229 --> 30:57.509
NARRATOR:
After another year of hard work

30:57.509 --> 31:01.259
but also one filled
with surprising new discoveries

31:01.259 --> 31:03.989
and compelling revelations,

31:03.989 --> 31:06.409
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
gather

31:06.409 --> 31:09.279
with their partners
and other members of the team

31:09.279 --> 31:11.299
in the war room
for their final meeting

31:11.299 --> 31:13.090
on Oak Island this year.

31:13.090 --> 31:15.860
-Hey, guys.
Sorry I couldn't be there.

31:15.860 --> 31:16.860
(overlapping greetings)

31:16.860 --> 31:17.860
NARRATOR:
Also joining the fellowship

31:17.860 --> 31:19.129
via video conference

31:19.129 --> 31:23.580
from Muskegon, Michigan,
is Marty's son, Alex.

31:23.580 --> 31:27.450
Well, gentlemen,
it is that time again.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.580
(chuckling)

31:28.580 --> 31:30.049
Winter is closing in.

31:30.049 --> 31:32.450
The weather is getting nasty.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.070
We're running out of time.

31:34.070 --> 31:35.700
The equipment has to go back.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.220
So, it's time
that we all get together

31:38.220 --> 31:40.270
to talk about Smith's Cove

31:40.270 --> 31:42.750
and, most importantly,
where in the heck

31:42.750 --> 31:44.539
are We going with it.
(chuckling)

31:44.539 --> 31:47.190
GARY:
I think it's been a big success.

31:47.190 --> 31:50.239
You've seen all the structures
we've uncovered,

31:50.239 --> 31:51.919
sometimes on a daily basis.

31:51.919 --> 31:53.700
Yeah.
DAVE: Yeah.

31:53.700 --> 31:55.820
You cannot look at this picture
and say

31:55.820 --> 31:57.519
we weren't successful
in accomplishing

31:57.519 --> 31:58.840
What We wanted to do.
(chuckling)

31:58.840 --> 32:00.700
I mean, there it is,
all laid out.

32:00.700 --> 32:04.230
We ran into all kinds of
heretofore unknown structures

32:04.230 --> 32:10.139
and what very much appears
to be an intact box drain

32:10.139 --> 32:14.149
and a big slipway that
goes well out into the ocean

32:14.149 --> 32:17.399
and the-the so-called
U-shaped structure.

32:17.399 --> 32:18.919
Clearly massive structures.

32:18.919 --> 32:20.070
Clearly well engineered.

32:20.070 --> 32:23.419
And where we are right now
is we just uncovered,

32:23.419 --> 32:24.739
as I believe everybody knows,

32:24.739 --> 32:27.460
yet another structure
in Smith's Cove.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.720
(chuckling)
-A big structure,

32:28.720 --> 32:29.979
a massive structure.

32:29.979 --> 32:31.549
And Craig-- I think
it was Craig who noticed.

32:31.549 --> 32:34.330
They're vertical cuts.
This is dimensional lumber,

32:34.330 --> 32:35.879
-but they're not circular...
Yes.

32:35.879 --> 32:36.879
...saw cuts. So this was done,

32:36.879 --> 32:37.879
perhaps, by hand.

32:37.879 --> 32:38.879
ALEX:
I feel like, last year,

32:38.879 --> 32:41.039
we found a lot of items,

32:41.039 --> 32:43.370
but we didn't have
any information about them.

32:43.370 --> 32:47.029
But, this year, I mean,
we have evidence that,

32:47.029 --> 32:49.129
you know, something unrecorded

32:49.129 --> 32:52.639
happened prior to the start
of the search process.

32:52.639 --> 32:54.999
You know? Right in line
with the theories.

32:54.999 --> 32:57.179
That actually is my biggie
for the year.

32:57.179 --> 32:58.989
Absolutely.
MARTY: We had the wood samples

32:58.989 --> 33:02.320
tested and the results dated
to 1769,

33:02.320 --> 33:08.440
25 to 30 years prior to
the discovery of the Money Pit.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.299
Right.
-I will say this, gentlemen.

33:11.299 --> 33:13.049
Uh, before that revelation,

33:13.049 --> 33:15.519
I was mulling this all over
in my head,

33:15.519 --> 33:16.940
and I was thinking
there's nothing here

33:16.940 --> 33:21.249
but searcher evidence
and was ready to sort of say,

33:21.249 --> 33:24.559
"I'm sorry. Nothing happened
here except collective madness."

33:24.559 --> 33:25.639
LAIRD:
Oh, no. I agree.

33:25.639 --> 33:26.639
The U-shaped structure--

33:26.639 --> 33:31.059
I was kind of excited about it
at the beginning of the season.

33:31.059 --> 33:33.090
Assumed it was searcher

33:33.090 --> 33:34.350
right up until...
Mm-hmm.

33:34.350 --> 33:36.099
...we got the dendro result,

33:36.099 --> 33:39.019
and then it just reset
everything to me.

33:39.019 --> 33:40.059
Yeah.
you know?

33:40.059 --> 33:41.480
Now we have a narrative we can--

33:41.480 --> 33:43.129
We have a place to start.

33:43.129 --> 33:45.049
MARTY:
Yeah, well, I have to say,

33:45.049 --> 33:46.629
something did happen here.
Very significant.

33:46.629 --> 33:47.730
Yes.
I have to.

33:47.730 --> 33:49.000
The data says that.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.419
So, the obvious question is,

33:51.419 --> 33:54.149
were the structures in Smith's
Cove built by the depositors

33:54.149 --> 33:56.679
of this treasure or was it

33:56.679 --> 33:59.179
-an attempt to, um...
Recover?

33:59.179 --> 34:00.470
...recover the treasure?

34:00.470 --> 34:02.139
So, it's 1769, sir.

34:02.139 --> 34:05.190
Are you here to make a deposit
or a withdrawal?

34:05.190 --> 34:06.190
(laughter)

34:06.190 --> 34:08.810
My assumption
would have been a deposit.

34:08.810 --> 34:11.060
The evidence is there.

34:11.060 --> 34:12.510
MARTY:
Dave, what about you?

34:12.510 --> 34:14.060
They did not come
to retrieve it.

34:14.060 --> 34:15.290
They came to put it.
(laughs)

34:15.290 --> 34:16.290
MARTY:
All right.

34:16.290 --> 34:17.290
Charles, I think I know,

34:17.290 --> 34:18.630
but say it.
I think It was

34:18.630 --> 34:20.530
-depositors, not retrievers.
GARY: I am in agreement

34:20.530 --> 34:22.159
-with you, Charles.
-MARTY: Yeah, but wait a minute.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.159
Let me ask it this way.

34:23.159 --> 34:24.449
-If you had to bet,
Mm.

34:24.449 --> 34:25.449
which way do you bet?

34:25.449 --> 34:27.909
Is there still something here
worth finding?

34:27.909 --> 34:29.850
CHARLES:
I would bet my life.

34:29.850 --> 34:30.900
you would bet
your life savings?

34:30.900 --> 34:31.900
-I would bet my--

34:31.900 --> 34:32.900
No, I'd bet my life.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.150
Based on what, Charles?

34:34.150 --> 34:36.800
Based on a belief
that it's there.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.389
MARTY: Okay.
I would bet my life.

34:39.389 --> 34:40.389
I would.

34:40.389 --> 34:42.040
Absolutely. Absolutely, Marty,

34:42.040 --> 34:44.190
we definitely find something.

34:44.190 --> 34:46.900
And I would bet my house and
my car and everything like that.

34:46.900 --> 34:47.900
MARTY:
All right, okay.

34:47.900 --> 34:48.900
How 'bout you, David?

34:48.900 --> 34:50.400
Yes, I think
there's something there.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.918
All right. Gary, which side
of the bet you taking?

34:52.918 --> 34:54.850
I know there's something
down there. I mean,

34:54.850 --> 34:56.790
that's like--
When I watch the hammer grab

34:56.790 --> 34:58.770
going down there and coming up,

34:58.770 --> 35:01.490
it reminds me
of one of those arcade games

35:01.490 --> 35:02.860
where you're trying
to get a teddy bear.

35:02.860 --> 35:03.860
(chuckling)
-We've all done it.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.570
We couldn't do it.

35:06.570 --> 35:08.500
Just need that lucky one grab.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.750
MARTY:
How about you, Alex?

35:11.750 --> 35:13.490
ALEX:
The question isn't,

35:13.490 --> 35:14.750
Is there treasure there?

35:14.750 --> 35:17.150
because there's no way
of knowing one way or another

35:17.150 --> 35:18.970
until we're so lucky
as to find it.

35:18.970 --> 35:20.070
The question is,

35:20.070 --> 35:25.910
That's kind of what I'm trying
to get to, though, Alex.

35:25.910 --> 35:29.600
That 1769 structure
says that to me, anyway.

35:29.600 --> 35:34.460
Unless it was a withdrawal
and not a deposit.

35:34.460 --> 35:35.750
God bless us.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.050
NARRATOR:
After finding strong evidence

35:38.050 --> 35:40.010
that a major operation
was conducted

35:40.010 --> 35:42.660
on Oak Island
some 25 years prior

35:42.660 --> 35:45.410
to the first reported discovery
of the Money Pit,

35:45.410 --> 35:47.570
Rick, Marty and their team

35:47.570 --> 35:50.470
are debating
a critical question.

35:50.470 --> 35:52.880
Was the construction
at Smith's Cove the result

35:52.880 --> 35:56.400
of someone depositing something
of great value on Oak Island

35:56.400 --> 36:00.330
or evidence
of their removing it?

36:00.330 --> 36:02.310
If it was deposited here
by the French

36:02.310 --> 36:03.880
and the French were helping
the Americans

36:03.880 --> 36:05.810
in the American
Revolutionary War,

36:05.810 --> 36:07.010
which they clearly were.

36:07.010 --> 36:08.720
Yeah.
-MARTY: So, they say they know

36:08.720 --> 36:09.810
a rebellion's brewing.

36:09.810 --> 36:11.070
They say, "You guys need money?

36:11.070 --> 36:13.010
I can tell you where some is."

36:13.010 --> 36:15.060
So they come up.
They dig it out.

36:15.060 --> 36:16.850
They know the British are...

36:16.850 --> 36:18.470
probably just two steps
behind them.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.510
This is a British colony.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.510
Sure, it is.

36:20.510 --> 36:22.170
MARTY:
They know that those guys

36:22.170 --> 36:24.660
are gonna get swamped
in the muck 40 feet below,

36:24.660 --> 36:26.480
don't they?
They know that for sure.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.530
It could tie up an entire couple
British warships

36:29.530 --> 36:31.010
with people trying
to dig up a treasure

36:31.010 --> 36:32.150
that is no longer there.

36:32.150 --> 36:34.450
JACK:
But if they were withdrawing,

36:34.450 --> 36:36.890
wouldn't they have shut off
the booby trap?

36:36.890 --> 36:37.890
Yes.
Yes.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.900
of course.
-There's no question about it.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.800
DAVE:
If they took whatever's here,

36:41.800 --> 36:43.450
you think they'd police
the areas

36:43.450 --> 36:45.790
and cover everything up
as good as they did?

36:45.790 --> 36:49.071
Why? Why?
-Why? What's the point?

36:49.071 --> 36:50.280
You just dig it up, and you go.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.280
-LAIRD: Oh, absolutely.
BILLY: Right.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.510
You don't know for sure
if it's a deposit

36:53.510 --> 36:54.960
or maybe it was taken

36:54.960 --> 36:56.830
or whatever, but you could go
on another island

36:56.830 --> 36:58.280
in Mahone Bay,
and I don't think you'd find

36:58.280 --> 37:00.210
near the things
that we found here.

37:00.210 --> 37:01.210
Yeah.

37:01.210 --> 37:02.900
So, I-I really believe
that there's

37:02.900 --> 37:05.360
definitely something
in Oak Island.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.840
RICK:
If we had found nothing,

37:08.840 --> 37:10.880
I'd probably be done right now.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.630
Well, we found them coins.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.920
Found a good number of those.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.720
The bones were older
than any known searcher,

37:18.720 --> 37:19.760
and the parchment.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.090
JACK:
Yeah, what about

37:21.090 --> 37:23.320
the bookbinding
that we found last year in H-8?

37:23.320 --> 37:25.440
I rest my case on that alone.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.740
CRAIG:
I agree completely.

37:27.740 --> 37:32.420
The whole story, the whole quest
started at the Money Pit.

37:32.420 --> 37:35.200
And after they...
You know, it flooded out,

37:35.200 --> 37:36.800
then they went to Smith's Cove,

37:36.800 --> 37:39.060
And then they felt
there was a flood tunnel.

37:39.060 --> 37:40.060
Yeah.

37:40.060 --> 37:41.060
Well, we've proven

37:41.060 --> 37:43.500
that there was activity going on
at Smith's Cove.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500
Yeah.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.620
MARTY:
I don't know, Craig.

37:45.620 --> 37:46.670
I don't know.

37:46.670 --> 37:49.400
But it sounds like a very strong
consensus around this table.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.390
There's something
still worth looking for.

37:51.390 --> 37:56.060
Uh, I could easily land
on the opposite side of that.

37:56.060 --> 38:00.690
DAN B.:
Marty, i-in my opinion,

38:00.690 --> 38:02.310
there's evidence
that has come out

38:02.310 --> 38:04.250
where these people have worked.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.950
And, I mean, when you can see it

38:06.950 --> 38:09.850
and have it
and put it in your hand,

38:09.850 --> 38:10.850
I mean, that's evidence.

38:10.850 --> 38:11.970
You can't take that away.

38:11.970 --> 38:15.790
And, I mean, if you want
to ignore it, ignore it.

38:15.790 --> 38:18.360
But, I mean, at your own peril.

38:18.360 --> 38:21.300
RICK:
I mean, look,

38:21.300 --> 38:26.000
I think we have all respected
what-- Dan's advice

38:26.000 --> 38:27.730
from a couple years ago,
you know?

38:27.730 --> 38:30.160
Let's take a deep breath.
Let's sit back.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.640
Let's think
about what we've done,

38:31.640 --> 38:36.820
think about what we might care
to do in the near future.

38:36.820 --> 38:39.000
So... it's a lot

38:39.000 --> 38:40.390
to look forward to
in the near term

38:40.390 --> 38:44.920
and-and as we look outward.

38:44.920 --> 38:48.310
Right.

38:48.310 --> 38:51.710
Okay.

38:51.710 --> 38:54.180
It's been a great year.

38:54.180 --> 38:57.110
I certainly want to thank

38:57.110 --> 38:58.630
each and every person
around this table

38:58.630 --> 39:02.060
for just a tremendous effort
and a job well done.

39:02.060 --> 39:04.080
I feel really good
about what we did.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.700
I feel really good
about what Rick led us to do.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.410
Um, you know, we accomplished

39:08.410 --> 39:10.080
the things
we set out to accomplish.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.930
We explored where
we needed to explore.

39:11.930 --> 39:14.820
So, Rick,
do you have anything to add?

39:14.820 --> 39:16.450
RICK:
First and foremost,

39:16.450 --> 39:20.480
to look around the table,
not only to see people

39:20.480 --> 39:22.030
in pursuit of a common goal,

39:22.030 --> 39:24.190
but friends, you know?

39:24.190 --> 39:26.130
Family. And I'm grateful

39:26.130 --> 39:27.910
that we're all here together.

39:27.910 --> 39:29.970
And I also think that

39:29.970 --> 39:34.840
it's been a long,
long year of discovery.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.750
But to that end,
I am not dismayed.

39:37.750 --> 39:41.210
I am very much looking forward
to the upcoming year.

39:41.210 --> 39:43.270
And, uh, I would ask everybody

39:43.270 --> 39:45.250
to put their hand in.

39:45.250 --> 39:49.270
So, one in, all in,

39:49.270 --> 39:50.820
once in, forever in.

39:50.820 --> 39:53.680
Again, thank you very much.

39:53.680 --> 39:57.930
-Let's go.
Amen.

39:57.930 --> 39:59.350
Yeah.

39:59.350 --> 40:02.970
NARRATOR:
For the Laginas and their team,

40:02.970 --> 40:06.520
it has been
an extraordinary year.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.380
Gary, you're the man.

40:08.380 --> 40:09.380
Thanks, mate.

40:09.380 --> 40:10.560
NARRATOR:
They not only conducted

40:10.560 --> 40:13.000
the most ambitious efforts
in the history

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
of a 223-year search

40:15.000 --> 40:16.940
for treasure on Oak Island...

40:16.940 --> 40:20.500
see you later.
-Laird, you're the best.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.550
...but they revealed
more pieces

40:21.550 --> 40:24.740
to this complex puzzle
than anyone before them.

40:24.740 --> 40:25.930
MARTY:
Been a great season.

40:25.930 --> 40:28.480
NARRATOR:
And as the search for the clues

40:28.480 --> 40:31.340
that will complete the picture
goes on,

40:31.340 --> 40:33.640
one thing appears more certain
than ever.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.340
MARTY:
Next year, the breakthrough.

40:35.340 --> 40:37.310
NARRATOR:
Something profound happened

40:37.310 --> 40:40.950
centuries ago on this
tiny North Atlantic island.

40:40.950 --> 40:42.290
Take care, Dan.

40:42.290 --> 40:43.510
NARRATOR:
Something that may have

40:43.510 --> 40:45.270
impacted the fate

40:45.270 --> 40:47.100
of the entire world.

40:47.100 --> 40:49.910
All right, guys. Let's roll.

40:49.910 --> 40:52.720
RICK:
There are significant questions

40:52.720 --> 40:55.530
which remain to be answered.

40:55.530 --> 40:57.870
But if there really is
a connection

40:57.870 --> 40:59.140
to the American Revolution,

40:59.140 --> 41:02.140
it is indeed a national treasure
for the U.S.

41:02.140 --> 41:03.340
because it rewrites history.

41:03.340 --> 41:05.470
It is a national treasure
for Nova Scotia

41:05.470 --> 41:08.070
because the mystery is here.

41:08.070 --> 41:09.620
MARTY:
It started out

41:09.620 --> 41:12.730
as a bit of a lark, didn't it?

41:12.730 --> 41:16.750
And then all of a sudden,
it became pretty intense.

41:16.750 --> 41:20.780
(chuckles): I've been
kind of forced to pay attention

41:20.780 --> 41:22.910
because of the magnitude
of this thing.

41:22.910 --> 41:26.370
And I really believe
we are the only searchers

41:26.370 --> 41:28.900
in 200 and whatever years

41:28.900 --> 41:32.100
that have proved that something
substantial happened here

41:32.100 --> 41:34.470
prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit.

41:34.470 --> 41:36.650
To me, I-I can't overstate
how significant that is.
