00:01.302 --> 00:05.204
<i> -Previously on</i> The Strain...
-What is the state

00:05.206 --> 00:07.973
of the city now?
<i> -Strigoi</i> roaming the streets.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.975
<i> Still feeding.</i>

00:09.977 --> 00:13.112
The<i> strigoi</i> have
taken ground from you.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.513
According to reports,

00:14.515 --> 00:16.548
you're having trouble
holding battle lines.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.617
The message is that we
are winning, but the truth is,

00:18.619 --> 00:22.388
we don't have the manpower
to take back New York City.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.958
Tell me how the hell
they're getting in here.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.193
They must be coming
from underground somehow.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.343
They're digging
their own tunnels now.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.812
Good news is that now I know
where they're coming from.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.814
Central Park.

00:48.816 --> 00:53.285
Central Park, central nest.

01:01.162 --> 01:04.163
(indistinct voices)

01:04.165 --> 01:06.598
(siren wailing)

01:06.600 --> 01:09.435
So the convict teams will
clear out all of the tunnels

01:09.437 --> 01:11.670
-underneath the park...
-Got it, yeah.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.939
and the police strike units
will secure the park surface,

01:13.941 --> 01:17.176
comb through every tree,
bush, gully,

01:17.178 --> 01:21.280
and building until every last
one of those creatures is dead.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.782
Ambitious.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.686
-Concerns?
-Same ones you have.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.621
It's a big gamble.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.857
-Yes, it is.
-(murmuring)

01:31.859 --> 01:34.626
There's no question.
It's a huge deployment,

01:34.628 --> 01:37.062
but this is what our problem has
been all along. We never cleared

01:37.064 --> 01:40.299
Central Park. And until
we take the Park back,

01:40.301 --> 01:43.702
we don't win.
So that's what we're gonna do.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.038
All right. Let's do this.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.640
Get everything in place.
We go at first light.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.376
-Great. Let's go.
-(murmuring)

01:51.378 --> 01:54.213
-Good luck.
-Captain.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.382
So, the big nest.

01:57.384 --> 02:01.320
-You have a plan.
-Star-spangled time.

02:01.322 --> 02:04.723
Rockets' red glare,
bombs bursting in air. Boom.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.391
We're setting you up with
an insertion team to help you

02:06.393 --> 02:07.893
get to your target.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.996
Those tunnels are
too small for a big team.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.565
It'll be small and tactical,

02:13.567 --> 02:16.135
but you're going
in there with a team.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.974
Good luck, Mr. Fet.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.909
And to you, Councilwoman.

02:23.911 --> 02:27.412
-Good hunting.
-You too.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.649
Boom, baby.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.653
♪ ♪

03:27.007 --> 03:28.473
That's the Jeter foul ball.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.076
The one you spilled
a soda on me trying to catch.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.078
Everything in your room and this
is what you choose to bring?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.914
You know, the sun's out.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.984
-And?
-Let's do something fun.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.687
-(knocking)
-MAN:<i> Zack?</i>

03:41.689 --> 03:45.324
KELLY: Zack...

03:45.326 --> 03:48.760
-What time is it?
-It's breakfast time.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.665
Why can't I have a clock?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.834
There's no need.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.638
Mr. Eichorst and I
have something for you.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.842
-(chittering)
-(gasps)

04:03.844 --> 04:06.745
Don't be afraid, Zack.
She's a feeler.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.680
She is here
to protect you.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.116
I've seen those
things kill people!

04:11.118 --> 04:13.619
These are very
special creatures, Zack.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.555
Very perceptive and agile.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.690
(low growling)

04:18.692 --> 04:21.460
What's wrong with its eyes?

04:21.462 --> 04:25.030
She was once a child about
your age, but she was blind.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.867
-Now she can see?
-With all her other senses,

04:28.869 --> 04:31.803
-better than you can.
-What's her name?

04:31.805 --> 04:34.806
You can name her.
Anything you like.

04:34.808 --> 04:38.143
She's here to serve you.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.212
Give her an order,

04:40.214 --> 04:43.148
-and she will carry it out.
-Like what?

04:43.150 --> 04:45.951
Bed.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.290
It's okay, Zack. Try it.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.793
Door.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.032
Come.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.471
She will do anything
you want her to do.

05:06.473 --> 05:10.609
But, most importantly,
she will keep you safe.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.779
Maybe once you become
more comfortable with her,

05:13.781 --> 05:16.581
the two of you can go
outside together at night.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.518
Get some fresh air.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.020
I know you want to go out.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.356
It's okay.

05:24.358 --> 05:28.727
Come on.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.068
You two have fun.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.706
(low growling)

05:49.950 --> 05:52.351
(indistinct chatter)

05:57.624 --> 05:59.658
-Hey, Officer.
-Hi.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.160
I'm looking
for a Captain Rogers?

06:02.162 --> 06:04.563
-Uh, I guess just over there.
-Right over there?

06:04.565 --> 06:07.666
-At the table, yeah.
-All right, thank you.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.634
Hey there. Captain Rogers?

06:09.636 --> 06:12.037
Right here.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.576
Captain Kate Rogers.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.579
Vasiliy.

06:20.581 --> 06:24.416
I thought you were stationed
on the other side of town.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.252
I was. Yeah, but it looks like

06:27.254 --> 06:29.821
we've gotta throw everything
we've got at Central Park.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.257
That's the plan, Captain.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.326
I drew the low card, though.

06:34.328 --> 06:37.429
I've gotta run some civilian
down underneath the Park.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.098
Supposedly he's gonna blow up
this big nest of<i> strigoi.</i>

06:40.100 --> 06:43.201
-A civilian, huh?
-Yeah, some city exterminator.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.871
Doesn't make sense to me.

06:45.873 --> 06:49.341
I'm the guy
who found the nest.

06:49.343 --> 06:52.277
You were with
the SEALs, right?

06:52.279 --> 06:55.847
-I was advising the SEALs.
-Oh.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.517
Oh, you didn't think that you
had a night with a Navy SEAL,

06:58.519 --> 07:00.452
-did you?
-No, that wasn't the reason

07:00.454 --> 07:02.354
-for anything.
-No, you know,

07:02.356 --> 07:04.689
'cause some women,
you know, they meet a guy,

07:04.691 --> 07:07.192
they find out he's a rat
catcher, you know, they get

07:07.194 --> 07:10.228
caught up in all the glamour.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.698
Yeah, I bet. You know,
when I met you at the bar,

07:13.700 --> 07:15.734
I didn't need
to review your resume

07:15.736 --> 07:18.603
to know you were
the right man for the job.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.209
Why don't you come with me
and I'm gonna go pick up

07:24.211 --> 07:26.912
a couple of things.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.981
Nah, I'm good. Got a couple
of things to pick up. Come on.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.284
All right, let's go.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.853
Captain Rogers!

07:52.473 --> 07:54.906
You don't have a key
to your own door?

07:54.908 --> 07:57.409
Door bolts from inside.

07:57.411 --> 08:00.312
Also, I don't want to get
shot by my new tenants, so...

08:06.520 --> 08:08.854
(bolt unlocking)

08:08.856 --> 08:10.856
Hey.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.891
-Sorry to wake you.
-It's all right.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.163
-This is Captain Rogers.
-Hi.

08:18.165 --> 08:22.234
-Hey.
-My new partner in crime.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.605
This is Dutch Velders.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.807
And that's the Doc.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.642
We just came to
pick up some stuff.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.544
It's your house.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.780
I didn't think you would
turn it into some kinda hospital

08:35.782 --> 08:38.617
-for munchers, but whatever.
-The bio-weapon's played out,

08:38.619 --> 08:41.219
so Eph and I have been
looking for other angles.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.122
Yeah. Us, too.

08:44.124 --> 08:48.193
Grab those bags
of powdered silver.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.068
-What do you need that for?
-Faraldo's mounting

08:57.070 --> 08:58.904
a big assault
on Central Park today.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.972
-Why Central Park?
-'Cause we found

09:00.974 --> 09:03.642
thousands of<i> strigois</i>
nesting under it.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.177
-It's infested.
-Doc!

09:06.179 --> 09:09.014
This could be exactly what
we need. A major battle,

09:09.016 --> 09:11.550
loads of<i> strigoi</i>
talking to each other.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.386
-When is this happening?
-First light.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.659
What, are you two...
Are you two coming?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.527
We're studying<i> strigoi</i>
communication patterns.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.195
This is an opportunity
to learn something.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.764
You're trying to figure out

09:25.766 --> 09:27.198
what they're saying to each
other during the battle?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.700
We don't need to know
what they're saying.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.336
We just need
to learn how to disrupt it.

09:31.338 --> 09:35.507
Uh, the rally point
is Columbus Circle, 5:00 a.m.

09:35.509 --> 09:37.142
See you then.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.579
Be careful. Good luck.

09:40.581 --> 09:43.748
-Be safe, huh?
-Yeah, you too.

09:50.524 --> 09:53.792
-Where'd he find her?
-Don't know, don't care.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.628
Now...

09:56.630 --> 10:00.031
which of these should
we use for the receiver?

10:00.033 --> 10:03.101
-Marley.
-Like Bob Marley?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.537
No, like Jacob Marley,
Scrooge's old business partner?

10:05.539 --> 10:07.872
Now a tormented ghost
of his former self.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.809
Works for me.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.978
Want me to name you?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.313
Would you like that?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.949
Right.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.619
You don't talk.

10:27.561 --> 10:29.961
(creature growling)

10:54.688 --> 10:56.988
(creature moaning)

11:01.261 --> 11:03.695
You don't have
to stay over there.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.731
You can come over
here if you want to.

11:27.387 --> 11:31.189
(creature purring)

11:33.794 --> 11:36.261
(alarm blaring)

11:49.743 --> 11:52.377
Looks like they're
bringing in everybody now.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.581
What, you think
a girl can't fight?

11:56.583 --> 11:59.017
I didn't say that.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.286
That's not what I meant.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.590
(siren)

12:08.028 --> 12:10.395
Everybody out!

12:10.397 --> 12:12.497
-Right this way.
-Listen up!

12:12.499 --> 12:15.433
Good news, people.
We are giving you

12:15.435 --> 12:19.104
the opportunity to take
part in a historic battle.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.840
The fate of Manhattan
depends on it.

12:21.842 --> 12:26.277
If you fight bravely,
full pardons.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.280
No more tunnel duty.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.416
Pick a weapon.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.330
Take this one.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.538
-How'd you get here?
-I got arrested last night.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.707
I didn't even do anything.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.109
I was just lifting
shit off bodies.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.379
Anything I could trade
for food.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.783
So if we make it,
they pardon us.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.891
Come on, man.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.660
-Don't listen to that.
-All right!

13:15.662 --> 13:17.796
Follow me.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.134
I guess so.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.312
Move it!

13:44.090 --> 13:46.357
None of the captains
reported any contact yet.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.027
I hate being here.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.296
When we fought in Red Hook
I was scared shitless,

13:51.298 --> 13:53.464
but at least I had
a rifle in my hands.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.466
Oh, hold on.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.770
-What is it?
-It's on. Three of our teams

13:58.772 --> 14:01.206
-have engaged the<i> strigoi.</i>
-Any news from Fet?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.341
Not yet.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.180
FET:
Uh, about 20 blocks to go.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.151
-Where are we going?
-This old water tunnel.

14:13.153 --> 14:17.555
So, the silver powder...
how do we disperse it?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.557
Ah, it's easy.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.726
We just tape the grenades
to the bags,

14:21.728 --> 14:24.495
set off a timer
so it blows in mid-air

14:24.497 --> 14:27.799
and let the barbecue begin.

14:27.801 --> 14:30.068
You can do all that without
blowing us up in the process?

14:30.070 --> 14:32.737
I'm excited to find out.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.473
All right.
We're hitting the tunnels.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.876
Lights!

14:54.761 --> 14:57.595
This should do nicely.

14:57.597 --> 15:01.366
Close enough to the tunnels
to catch their communications.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.601
Plenty of sunlight
to keep us safe.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.704
This kind of reminds me of
when we were spying on Palmer.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.707
Except he was speaking
English. Out loud.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.677
Always the
technicalities with you.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.946
If they're talking, we will
hear them. The question is,

15:14.948 --> 15:16.848
will we hear
the Master talking back?

15:16.850 --> 15:18.883
We just need to look for
anomalies, anything that breaks

15:18.885 --> 15:21.753
the established
communication patterns.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.393
You never rendered your
opinion on Captain Rogers.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.795
-Who?
-You know,

15:30.797 --> 15:33.531
Fet's new comrade-in-arms.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.534
Oh, yeah, I did.
I said I didn't care.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.536
Am I sensing some jealousy here?

15:38.538 --> 15:41.639
No. Not at all, actually.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.042
She seems very lovely.
Disciplined.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.044
She could be very good for him.

15:46.046 --> 15:49.614
Yeah, but you're imagining
your sword at her throat.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.716
I wish her nothing
but the best.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.551
That's good, because she could
probably take you in a fight.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.486
Okay, now you're just
baiting me,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.455
which I'm not going to rise to,
not even to defend

15:57.457 --> 15:59.390
-my fighting skills, which,
I might add, -Stating a fact.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.060
-are vastly superior to yours.
-Okay, now you're baiting me.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.962
Not my fault if you're
telegraphing your moves

16:03.964 --> 16:05.930
-all the time.
-That's absurd.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.098
I very consciously
misdirect my--

16:07.100 --> 16:08.399
(rumbling)

16:08.401 --> 16:11.402
-(whooshing)
-Wow.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.739
Look at that. Chattering
like magpies out there.

16:14.741 --> 16:18.042
(siren)

16:34.194 --> 16:37.829
-Okay, we're clear.
-(whispering): Heads up!

16:39.866 --> 16:42.834
(growling)

16:50.377 --> 16:52.510
Watch your flanks.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.682
(whispering):
Keep your eyes open.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.524
(growling)

17:18.905 --> 17:21.672
-Eyes up, okay?
-Yeah.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.208
Okay, okay, okay.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.315
-Lee, clear.
-Copy.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.751
(shrieking)

17:33.753 --> 17:36.087
(gunshots)

17:36.089 --> 17:39.557
(squealing and shouting)

17:43.363 --> 17:45.897
(growling)

17:48.501 --> 17:52.003
(Lee wailing)

17:52.005 --> 17:54.172
Lee? Riley? You good?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.107
Shit.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.209
(snarling)

17:58.211 --> 18:01.079
Stay down!

18:28.208 --> 18:31.375
When they come,

18:31.377 --> 18:33.644
you wanna make sure
you keep them

18:33.646 --> 18:35.646
at least two arm-lengths
away from you, okay?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.648
That's as far as
the stinger can reach.

18:37.650 --> 18:41.452
Just remember,
if it touches you, you will die.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.456
I know.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.992
All right, listen up.
We're gonna go in here.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.728
Elizalde, you and
the big guy, you go first.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.497
Why don't you go first?
You got the guns.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.799
That's right. We do.

18:54.801 --> 18:59.137
If you see any stingers,
lead 'em back here.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.439
We'll take them down
when they come through.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.674
Oh, really? Okay, because
I just saw you back there,

19:03.676 --> 19:06.744
shaking like you were
about to start crying.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.814
I don't wanna come through there
and you hit me by accident.

19:11.851 --> 19:15.419
Does this look shaky
to you,<i> pendejo?</i>

19:15.421 --> 19:17.655
Let's go, let's go.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.597
-Real funny.
-She stays.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.167
Fine.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.855
Look out.

19:53.126 --> 19:55.560
-(snarling)
-Right there!

19:55.562 --> 19:58.930
(shrieking and growling)

20:03.636 --> 20:05.303
Should we go in?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.805
You got the guns!
What you think?

20:07.807 --> 20:11.475
No, we've gotta stay here
and protect the whole team.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.078
Elizalde?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.647
Hurtado?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.951
ELIZALDE: Tunnel's clear!

20:23.056 --> 20:25.423
Country Club, Bam-Bam,
get in there.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.558
See what's going on.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.396
Come on, hustle. Come on,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

20:47.780 --> 20:50.248
Awesome.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.053
It's really not that hard.
You've just gotta go

20:56.055 --> 20:58.956
for the head. Think they
were looking for you, bro.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.726
-All clear?
-Yeah, I think

21:01.728 --> 21:03.894
I said that already.

21:03.896 --> 21:07.031
Nice work, Elizalde.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.400
Stay right by me.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.636
Come on, this way.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.772
Watch the white.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.286
Wait.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.525
(shrieking)

21:42.402 --> 21:46.704
MAN (in distance): Help me!
Somebody help me!

21:48.441 --> 21:50.207
(groaning):
In here!

21:58.751 --> 22:01.485
Check me.

22:10.263 --> 22:13.597
(beeps)

22:13.599 --> 22:16.334
Ah, shit.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.439
Lee, I'm so sorry.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.541
No, wait, don't--

22:23.543 --> 22:25.676
(gunshots)

22:30.049 --> 22:31.949
You're okay to keep going?

22:31.951 --> 22:34.785
We're coming back
for the bodies.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.887
Yeah.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.880
This is us.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.985
I'm pretty sure
this is police brutality.

23:07.987 --> 23:11.222
You gonna at least say
"please" this time?

23:12.592 --> 23:14.225
(growling)

23:16.529 --> 23:19.663
What was that?

23:19.665 --> 23:22.900
You. Come on, get in there.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.869
Me?

23:24.871 --> 23:27.271
-Yell out what you hear.
-I'll do it.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.573
No, no, she goes. Alone.

23:32.845 --> 23:36.514
-But I don't know--
-Get in there!

23:36.516 --> 23:40.084
Come on! Just go!

23:44.557 --> 23:46.857
Come on! Come on! Come on!

23:46.859 --> 23:49.627
(gun clicking)
Don't try me! Go!

23:49.629 --> 23:52.196
ELIZALDE: Angel!

23:52.198 --> 23:54.465
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

23:54.467 --> 23:57.134
-Let go of her, piece of shit!
-You don't got a clear shot,

23:57.136 --> 23:59.470
-bitch!
-I do.

23:59.472 --> 24:03.641
Look, look, nobody
has to get hurt, okay?

24:03.643 --> 24:05.776
We're just gonna
walk outta here.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.312
Soon as we're in a safe place,
I'm gonna let her go.

24:08.314 --> 24:11.115
All right? Come on, Maria.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.984
Just do what
he says, Tardi.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.420
Just put the gun down, okay?

24:16.422 --> 24:19.957
(grunting and screaming)

24:19.959 --> 24:23.160
(sobbing): Oh, God!

24:23.162 --> 24:26.897
(Maria crying)

24:26.899 --> 24:29.500
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

24:29.502 --> 24:32.002
It's okay. Come here.
It's okay. Come on, come on.

24:32.004 --> 24:35.506
Drop this, drop it, drop it.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.575
Take this.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.077
It's okay, it's okay.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.246
Just point it
and pull the trigger.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.682
All right? Come on, let's go.
Come on, Angel, let's go.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.817
You all right?

24:59.532 --> 25:01.665
(low growling)

25:03.536 --> 25:05.836
Ready?

25:13.212 --> 25:15.880
Not bad.

25:15.882 --> 25:19.617
-What? What is it? Hey!
-(creature growling)

25:19.619 --> 25:22.786
Come back here.

25:22.788 --> 25:26.357
Zack, pack your things.
We have to leave.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.693
Why?

25:29.695 --> 25:31.829
It's no longer safe here.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.465
People are coming
who want to kill us.

25:34.467 --> 25:37.468
Hurry up.
Take whatever you want.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.970
We are not coming back here.

25:39.972 --> 25:43.874
You have three minutes.

26:18.611 --> 26:22.513
We're observing
clusters of sonic activity

26:22.515 --> 26:24.515
at irregular intervals,

26:24.517 --> 26:27.785
but will require further...
(sighs)

26:27.787 --> 26:30.888
Setting off your own
bullshit detector again?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.890
Let me try.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.960
We have a shit-ton of signaling
and no idea what it means.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.129
And we may never.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.699
Don't be such a glass
half-empty bloke, Doc.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.901
We are going to be
like the Bletchley Park

26:43.903 --> 26:47.638
Enigma code ladies. I've always
had a little fantasy about that.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.074
Being in World War II,
code breaking,

26:50.076 --> 26:52.209
tidy lipstick, rolls in my hair.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.277
That's delightful.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.450
(beeping, whooshing)

27:24.410 --> 27:27.578
It's hard to tell
where we are on this map.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.848
But there should be
a shaft somewhere around here

27:30.850 --> 27:33.317
that leads to the surface--
(growling)

27:37.790 --> 27:40.157
(clattering)

27:42.695 --> 27:46.497
(growling and squealing)

27:48.434 --> 27:50.934
(growling)
Everybody be careful!

27:50.936 --> 27:52.936
(shrieking)

27:52.938 --> 27:55.606
(yelling)

27:55.608 --> 27:58.175
(creature snorting)

27:59.879 --> 28:02.146
I'm out!

28:02.148 --> 28:04.948
They're trying to
make us run out of ammo.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.817
They're doing a good job.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.653
-(squealing)
-(gunshot)

28:09.655 --> 28:11.555
Where did that shot come from?

28:11.557 --> 28:14.458
-FET: Who's there?
-Where's that coming from?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.293
-Who was that? We will shoot!
-Who's there?

28:16.295 --> 28:19.396
-(overlapping voices)
-FET: Everyone shut up!

28:19.398 --> 28:21.832
Fet!

28:21.834 --> 28:24.001
Fet, is that you?

28:24.003 --> 28:26.070
ROGERS:
You know this guy?

28:26.072 --> 28:28.238
Gus!

28:28.240 --> 28:30.808
(laughing)

28:30.810 --> 28:33.177
-Fet, good to see you.
-Gus.

28:33.179 --> 28:36.313
This is Gus.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.982
That's Angel.

28:38.984 --> 28:42.052
-This is Kate, and I--
-Maria.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.257
What the hell are
you guys doing down here?

28:47.259 --> 28:50.561
-We thought you guys were dead.
-Cops arrested us,

28:50.563 --> 28:53.397
forced us to fight.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.669
You know anything about that?

28:58.671 --> 29:00.637
Faraldo needed more bodies.

29:02.775 --> 29:05.342
Look, I'm not gonna force
you to do anything, all right?

29:05.344 --> 29:07.778
I'm just gonna ask you.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.781
We need your help.

29:10.783 --> 29:13.283
You're already
down here, you know?

29:13.285 --> 29:15.285
I don't know, Fet.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.921
I mean, we really ain't into

29:17.923 --> 29:20.691
being in the whole chain
gang anymore, you know.

29:20.693 --> 29:24.595
You're not going back to
no chain gang. I promise you.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.303
You gotta let these two go.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.475
It's no place for her, Angel.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.612
You gotta get her to safety.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.214
Okay, okay.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.617
Take the map.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.823
Thank you.

29:52.825 --> 29:55.392
You'll be all right.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.961
Okay, this way.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.771
We're burning daylight.
Where is he? Where is Fet?

30:07.773 --> 30:10.007
On his way.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.409
Which means that
we don't know if he'll make it

30:12.411 --> 30:14.945
to the nest before dark.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.014
Your call...

30:17.016 --> 30:19.016
but you can turn him around.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.653
After dark, it's gonna be
a whole different ball game.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.525
Keep going.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.271
What is this place?

30:41.273 --> 30:43.607
You're the New York City expert.
It's not on your map?

30:43.609 --> 30:46.009
No.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.123
Shit.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.025
What? What is it?

31:02.027 --> 31:05.295
Doc's kid. He was here.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.899
Doc? You read me?

31:08.901 --> 31:10.901
Dr. Ephraim Goodweather.

31:10.903 --> 31:12.970
This is Vasiliy Fet.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.372
Please come in.

31:27.720 --> 31:31.021
So, did we get anything
out of this? Anything of use?

31:31.023 --> 31:33.190
Once we analyze
the data, yeah.

31:33.192 --> 31:36.059
Well, that's promising.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.362
Were you expecting
to hear their plans

31:38.364 --> 31:40.430
-for world domination?
-I don't know

31:40.432 --> 31:42.933
-what I was expecting.
-(interference rumbling)

31:45.170 --> 31:48.739
I wasn't expecting that.

31:48.741 --> 31:52.743
This is a massive
communications spike.

31:52.745 --> 31:55.445
FET (over radio):
Eph. Ephraim Goodweather.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.714
It's Fet. You out there?

31:57.716 --> 32:00.117
Fet, yeah. This is Eph.

32:00.119 --> 32:03.921
Go to channel three. You copy?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.225
Fet? You there?

32:08.227 --> 32:10.627
-What's up?
-Doc, it's...

32:10.629 --> 32:13.063
it's about Zack.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.666
You should get down here.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.772
(siren wailing)

32:24.209 --> 32:26.977
Sun has gone down.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.546
Please tell me we are close.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.883
We're close.
Fet's almost at the nest.

32:32.885 --> 32:36.954
(Faraldo sighing)

32:40.225 --> 32:42.159
DUTCH:
You sure it's this way?

32:42.161 --> 32:44.661
EPHRAIM: It's what Fet said.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.500
Jesus.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.211
-(creature shrieking)
-(Dutch yelping)

33:09.088 --> 33:11.855
Shit.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.695
Guess what?
They know we're here now.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.612
-(rumbling)
-Here we are.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.215
This is it.

33:41.954 --> 33:44.054
Let's do this.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.602
(creatures growling)

34:01.974 --> 34:05.175
Holy shit.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.511
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

34:07.513 --> 34:09.679
Looks like we found
the slumber party.

34:09.681 --> 34:13.917
All right. Pass them down.

34:18.657 --> 34:22.426
-You got it, Fet?
-Got it.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.728
(distant snarling)

34:30.169 --> 34:32.469
(growling)

34:37.176 --> 34:39.276
(growling)

34:41.680 --> 34:43.613
Hear that?

34:46.018 --> 34:48.351
Fet, hurry up.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.420
(snarling)

34:50.422 --> 34:53.356
(screaming)

34:53.358 --> 34:56.126
-(creatures shrieking)
-Fet! Here they come!

35:03.702 --> 35:07.104
They're coming
from everywhere, Fet!

35:07.106 --> 35:09.539
-You ready, little bastards?
-Forget the wire!

35:09.541 --> 35:11.708
Just pull the pins
and toss them!

35:11.710 --> 35:14.811
No! I gotta make
sure that the silver

35:14.813 --> 35:17.080
spreads throughout the cavern.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.216
It's gotta go off
at the right height,

35:19.218 --> 35:21.551
or else we're not going
to get all of them.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.920
Hurry up, Fet! Let's go!

35:23.922 --> 35:25.856
-Fet, watch out!
-(creature shrieking)

35:34.733 --> 35:36.900
Fire in the hole!

35:36.902 --> 35:39.002
Save me a leg!

35:48.113 --> 35:49.913
(creatures screaming)

35:49.915 --> 35:51.781
Watch out!

35:51.783 --> 35:54.351
(shrieking)

35:56.455 --> 35:59.089
(laughing)

35:59.091 --> 36:01.958
Woo! Oh, shit.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.361
-It's about damn time!
-Oh, shit!

36:04.363 --> 36:07.531
Fry, you bastards!

36:13.805 --> 36:16.773
This is Kowalski.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.009
Copy that.

36:20.946 --> 36:24.381
It's done.
Fet took out the nest.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.354
Yeah, but we still have
to get through the night, okay?

36:39.498 --> 36:42.165
Well, I'd say you've
done it, Councilwoman.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.668
The park is ours.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.337
Tomorrow, Manhattan.

36:47.339 --> 36:50.373
Then on from there.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.579
It's a good night.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.982
(water trickling)

37:54.873 --> 37:56.406
He's still alive.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.775
Well, he-he must be close by!

38:04.883 --> 38:08.752
(distant door closing)

38:08.754 --> 38:10.687
Zack?

38:12.891 --> 38:15.258
Zack, are you here?

38:15.260 --> 38:17.294
(footsteps approaching)

38:20.132 --> 38:22.499
-He is not.
-Where is he?

38:22.501 --> 38:24.501
Where is my son?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.170
He is a very
special young man.

38:27.172 --> 38:30.607
So much potential.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.609
He is safe.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.178
From you.

38:35.180 --> 38:38.415
He told us how
you abandoned him,

38:38.417 --> 38:40.717
so many times.

38:44.623 --> 38:47.657
But please allow me
to congratulate you

38:47.659 --> 38:50.160
on your great
victory here today.

38:50.162 --> 38:54.030
Perhaps a monument will be
built to Councilwoman Faraldo

38:54.032 --> 38:57.534
in Central Park. Or perhaps not.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.803
OFFICER (over radio):
Command. Checkpoint Bravo 116.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.439
Command,
we're in a world of shit.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.607
-What's going on here?
-On speakers.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.810
Copy Bravo 116. This is Command.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.446
-SECRET, over.
-Command, we've got thousands

39:09.448 --> 39:13.116
-of<i> strigoi</i> pouring in. Fence--
-Pull up the checkpoint feeds.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.985
15 men down.
We need help fast!

39:15.987 --> 39:19.022
116 Command, respond.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.990
-116?
-Christ almighty.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.993
They've overrun our
checkpoint at 116th Street?

39:23.995 --> 39:26.896
And 110th and Amsterdam?

39:26.898 --> 39:30.133
They've broken through
our entire northern perimeter.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.669
They lured us to keep
us out after nightfall.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.638
OFFICER: Command, up north!
It's a goddamn flood!

39:35.640 --> 39:37.974
Why don't you surrender,
Dr. Goodweather?

39:37.976 --> 39:40.477
Do you truly believe

39:40.479 --> 39:44.514
there is a grand design
predicated upon human dominance?

39:44.516 --> 39:47.250
Of course you don't.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.853
As a scientist
and a man of medicine,

39:49.855 --> 39:52.188
you know such matters

39:52.190 --> 39:55.492
are not left to
the whim of divinity

39:55.494 --> 40:00.230
but are the result
of sheer force.

40:00.232 --> 40:04.701
The strongest will prevail.

40:04.703 --> 40:08.338
-Where is my son?!
-Your wife and your child

40:08.340 --> 40:10.740
call to you.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.048
(screaming)

40:19.050 --> 40:22.452
(shrieking and grunting)

40:31.129 --> 40:33.730
-We can't stop fighting.
-Get that rooftop camera

40:33.732 --> 40:37.734
-from the Met for me.
-On your screen now.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.869
That means we cracked
our lines at the reservoir.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.338
Mother of God.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.879
I hope you're
ready to be a hero.

40:49.881 --> 40:53.082
What I'm ready for is to
knock back a couple of beers.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.885
OFFICER (over radio):
They claimed our position.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.755
Five guys left! We're
surrounded. Nobody can--

40:58.757 --> 41:02.225
We need help right now!

41:02.227 --> 41:04.394
(siren wailing)

41:04.396 --> 41:07.297
(people yelling)

41:10.902 --> 41:13.303
This isn't good.

41:13.305 --> 41:17.173
-Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
-Infected! Thousands of them!

41:17.175 --> 41:19.242
Get the hell outta here!

41:19.244 --> 41:21.978
The<i> strigoi</i> are
taking back the park.

41:24.249 --> 41:27.750
Doc! We need to get our shit
out of the kiosk or we risk

41:27.752 --> 41:30.353
losing everything! Let's not
leave here empty-handed!

41:30.355 --> 41:33.256
-I'm not leaving.
-Zack's not here, Eph.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.191
We'll find him later.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.927
(creatures growling)

41:37.929 --> 41:40.497
(sirens wailing)

41:46.271 --> 41:49.839
It was a trap. So they could
sweep south through Harlem.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.442
I never dreamed
there'd be that many.

41:52.444 --> 41:55.678
We're not gonna hold the park.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.383
All units, this is
Justine Faraldo. Withdraw.

42:00.385 --> 42:03.052
Pull out of the Park! Now!

42:03.054 --> 42:05.922
Withdraw! All units, withdraw!

42:13.465 --> 42:15.899
It's over.

42:17.836 --> 42:20.570
