05:44.416 --> 05:45.501
Mom?

05:46.710 --> 05:47.962
Hey, sweetie.

05:48.921 --> 05:50.798
What are you doing up? Come here.

05:50.965 --> 05:52.466
I don't like my room.

05:53.217 --> 05:54.635
No?

05:56.136 --> 05:59.014
That's okay. You know,
you're still getting used to it.

05:59.223 --> 06:00.975
I can't sleep either.

06:01.809 --> 06:03.602
What are you looking at?

06:03.978 --> 06:06.480
Some old photos. You want to see?

06:12.861 --> 06:14.863
- Do you know who that is?
- No.

06:15.573 --> 06:18.075
- It's me.
- It doesn't look like you.

06:20.244 --> 06:23.664
I know. But that's me. That's your mom.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.709
I was a kid once, too,
believe it or not.

06:27.543 --> 06:28.752
You're old now.

06:30.838 --> 06:32.965
- How old do you think I am?
- Really old.

06:34.466 --> 06:35.926
Have a guess.

06:36.677 --> 06:39.930
Probably at least 21.

06:43.017 --> 06:44.518
I wish you were right.

06:45.060 --> 06:47.521
Show me a picture
of when Dad was a little kid.

06:47.605 --> 06:50.274
You know, I wish I could.
But I don't think we have any.

06:50.357 --> 06:52.776
He's really hopeless at keeping photos.

06:52.860 --> 06:55.571
Show me a picture of
when I was a little kid.

06:55.863 --> 06:59.408
You are a little kid. You're wonderful.

07:03.871 --> 07:06.373
You certainly didn't cry
as much as your little sister.

07:06.457 --> 07:09.293
But she's up, so let's go.
Get some breakfast.

07:09.710 --> 07:11.795
- Billing department.
- Let me play.

07:11.879 --> 07:13.130
- No.
- I want to play!

07:13.213 --> 07:15.049
- I'm eating breakfast!
- Billing department. Careful.

07:15.132 --> 07:16.258
I need a bowl, Mom

07:16.342 --> 07:18.927
I don't want to play soon.
I want to play now.

07:19.011 --> 07:20.846
No, no, no, no.

07:20.929 --> 07:22.222
Here, here.

07:23.932 --> 07:26.101
- It's too small.
- Well, just make it work.

07:28.395 --> 07:32.691
Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent.

07:44.411 --> 07:46.288
Oh, man, what?

07:46.914 --> 07:49.166
Every time I think I've pulled you out,

07:50.042 --> 07:51.752
you grow back in.

07:53.379 --> 07:54.505
God.

07:54.922 --> 07:57.383
- Good morning, guys.
- Speak to an agent!

07:57.466 --> 07:58.509
I'm an agent.

07:58.592 --> 08:01.220
Yeah, hello, I would really like to keep
the old number if that's possible.

08:01.303 --> 08:03.555
- Dude, don't eat on the floor, Foster.
- But I'm pouring my cereal.

08:03.639 --> 08:05.933
Can I have it by the end of the day,
please, because I...

08:06.392 --> 08:09.228
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

08:10.854 --> 08:12.439
Foster, can you please
get up off the floor?

08:13.148 --> 08:14.274
Cap's loose.

08:19.446 --> 08:21.615
What is this? Is that wax?

08:22.533 --> 08:24.743
We have no actual fruit?
We have wax fruit?

08:34.962 --> 08:36.505
God damn it.

08:38.841 --> 08:40.217
And, honey,
if you wanna look at my books,

08:40.299 --> 08:41.885
please don't
leave them all over the floor.

08:41.969 --> 08:43.220
I didn't touch your books.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.472
- Bye.
- See you, Dad.

08:45.723 --> 08:47.057
See you, buddy.

08:47.141 --> 08:48.379
You're not gonna take
the boys to school?

08:48.390 --> 08:50.543
I can't today. Bye.

08:50.602 --> 08:52.980
- Are you gonna pick them up?
- I can't. I got a PTA meeting.

08:53.063 --> 08:54.606
- I totally forgot.
- Why didn't you tell me?

08:54.690 --> 08:57.901
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.

08:57.985 --> 08:59.027
I'll see you guys. Bye.

09:06.118 --> 09:09.496
Yeah, I'm looking west

09:10.789 --> 09:13.834
Always been looking that way

09:15.127 --> 09:18.505
I'm gonna get it all happening

09:19.214 --> 09:22.342
Just can't do it today

09:28.682 --> 09:31.268
Yeah, I'm looking west

09:32.519 --> 09:35.856
Always been looking that way

09:36.857 --> 09:40.235
I'm gonna be somebody

09:40.903 --> 09:44.448
I just can't be her today

11:35.100 --> 11:37.060
- Hello?
- Daddy!

11:37.978 --> 11:40.022
Hey, buddy, slow down...

11:41.481 --> 11:43.400
- This is awesome!
- Share it with your brother.

11:43.483 --> 11:44.735
- Okay.
- Share with your brother.

11:44.818 --> 11:46.189
- Come watch TV with me.
- All right.

11:46.202 --> 11:48.047
Look at this, babe. Nice job!

11:48.155 --> 11:50.866
- Yes, it's getting there.
- Getting there?

11:51.491 --> 11:53.243
- It looks awesome.
- Thanks.

11:54.077 --> 11:55.120
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:17.684 --> 12:19.895
Have you seen
my box of sheet music anywhere?

12:21.229 --> 12:23.273
I don't know, babe.
I know we packed them.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.442
I packed them. I know.
I just... I can't find them.

12:25.525 --> 12:28.487
I think the movers might have put them
in the dining room.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.822
- Come here, baby girl, come here.
- It's not in the dining room.

12:30.906 --> 12:33.867
I've unpacked every single box,
and it's just vanished.

12:34.034 --> 12:35.243
I can't find it.

12:36.703 --> 12:39.539
We'll find them. We'll find them.

14:16.261 --> 14:18.764
Dalton, honey? Where are you?

14:22.017 --> 14:24.478
Stay here.
Foster, stay with your sister.

14:25.437 --> 14:26.897
- Dalton?
- Dalton!

14:26.980 --> 14:28.106
Dalton!

14:29.900 --> 14:31.318
- Hey!
- What?

14:31.485 --> 14:34.071
- Hey, hey. Hey.
- What happened?

14:34.488 --> 14:36.106
Did you fall?
Did you fall off the ladder?

14:36.190 --> 14:37.074
Honey, did you fail down?

14:37.157 --> 14:38.408
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

14:38.492 --> 14:39.910
- What are you doing climbing the ladder?
- Honey...

14:39.993 --> 14:42.829
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Are you okay?

14:43.830 --> 14:45.874
- What hurts? What hurts?
- My leg.

14:47.084 --> 14:50.003
All right. Can you move it?
Can you move your leg? Is that okay?

14:50.087 --> 14:51.546
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:52.005 --> 14:53.465
Oh, man. What happened to your head?

14:53.673 --> 14:55.008
- Oh, gosh!
- Scraped it.

14:55.092 --> 14:56.301
Okay.

14:58.053 --> 15:00.972
Honey, you cannot come up here, okay?
Do not explore anymore.

15:01.056 --> 15:03.725
It's very dangerous, okay?
It's off limits now.

15:03.809 --> 15:06.436
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.022
- Can you stand on it? Be careful.
- I think so.

15:09.106 --> 15:10.607
I got you. Come here.

15:10.690 --> 15:13.318
What are you doing?
You scared us, buddy.

15:14.152 --> 15:16.780
You were just doing a little exploring?

15:16.863 --> 15:17.989
Yeah.

15:27.165 --> 15:30.085
- So, no more exploring up there, okay?
- Okay.

15:31.128 --> 15:34.881
Yeah, you may be a superhero, buddy,
but you're not invincible.

15:35.048 --> 15:37.384
- You gotta be careful, all right?
- Okay.

15:37.926 --> 15:39.052
Yeah.

15:42.389 --> 15:43.431
Good night, sweetie.

15:46.518 --> 15:47.894
So were you putting boxes away upstairs?

15:48.895 --> 15:49.938
Don't, Josh.

15:50.939 --> 15:53.191
I just hate feeling helpless. Sorry.

15:53.984 --> 15:55.569
I'll figure out a way
to lock the door tomorrow.

15:55.694 --> 15:58.363
Good. It's dangerous, you know.

15:58.905 --> 16:01.324
Maybe we should just put him
on a child leash.

16:01.616 --> 16:03.243
I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow.

16:07.581 --> 16:10.000
I'm sorry I was pissy
when you got home from work today.

16:10.167 --> 16:11.710
No, didn't notice.

16:11.793 --> 16:15.755
I was trying
to do some work today and then

16:16.173 --> 16:21.303
Cali woke up after a half hour,
and she wouldn't go back down,

16:22.387 --> 16:24.014
and I just didn't get anything done.

16:27.893 --> 16:30.937
I just want things to be different
in this house.

16:32.105 --> 16:34.733
I just had such a bad day.
I'm scared nothing is gonna change.

16:34.816 --> 16:38.278
It will, I promise you.
We've just got to give it time.

16:42.699 --> 16:45.785
Thanks for letting me take some time
to work on my music.

16:45.869 --> 16:48.121
Come on, I want you to do it.

16:49.664 --> 16:53.084
I think I have a couple of good songs.
I mean, not all of them, but I think...

16:53.168 --> 16:56.546
You know, there's a few that
I can do something with.

16:57.797 --> 16:58.924
I love all your songs.

16:59.132 --> 17:01.468
- Shut up. You do not!
- I do. Stop it.

17:04.304 --> 17:05.680
Which one's your favorite?

17:08.724 --> 17:11.770
- You should write a song about me.
- They're all about you.

17:12.186 --> 17:14.105
Like how cool I am.

17:14.356 --> 17:17.776
- Like, "He's the coolest guy..."
- No, no, no, no, no.

17:18.026 --> 17:21.863
- No, no, no. Quiet.
- "Big muscles!"

17:22.739 --> 17:25.992
- "Really, really pretty!"
- You'll wake up the baby.

18:16.459 --> 18:18.503
Foster,
can you finish your eggs, please?

18:19.546 --> 18:21.214
Hey, Cali.

18:22.590 --> 18:25.427
- Can you go wake up Dalton, Josh?
- Yeah.

18:29.931 --> 18:32.183
Hey, Mr. Sleepy-pants. Get up.

18:35.937 --> 18:39.232
Hey, Sleepy-pants.
You'd better get out of that bed

18:39.524 --> 18:42.110
or your mother's gonna kill us both.

18:45.697 --> 18:47.574
Dalton, come on, buddy.
You gotta get ready for school.

18:50.201 --> 18:52.162
Hey. Hey.

18:55.081 --> 18:56.291
Dalton.

18:59.502 --> 19:00.712
Dalton?

19:02.172 --> 19:06.301
Dalton. Dalton. Dalton. Dalton!

19:07.218 --> 19:10.597
There is no brain damage
that we've detected.

19:11.264 --> 19:13.433
Technically, yes, he's in a coma.

19:13.516 --> 19:16.644
He doesn't react to stimuli.
He has no sleep-wake cycle.

19:16.728 --> 19:19.002
But there's
no brain trauma or infection.

19:19.087 --> 19:20.965
His scans are all normal.

19:21.775 --> 19:24.152
To be honest,
I've never seen anything like it.

19:25.111 --> 19:28.323
But he can't just not wake up. I mean...

19:29.115 --> 19:31.701
There's got to be something.

19:32.327 --> 19:33.828
I'm sorry.

19:36.206 --> 19:37.916
Okay, so what do we do?

19:38.458 --> 19:41.586
- Does he stay here? Do we...
- We'll conduct some further testing.

19:41.669 --> 19:44.964
It's only been a couple of days.
It could take a little longer for...

19:45.965 --> 19:48.301
Excuse me a minute. I have to step out.
I'll be back in just a moment.

19:49.135 --> 19:51.638
Dr. Sercarz,
how long will the tests take?

20:07.904 --> 20:11.574
Okay, so what I've done here is I've
inserted a nasogastric feeding tube.

20:11.783 --> 20:14.744
To get the length of the tube
that I'm gonna need,

20:15.161 --> 20:18.373
I measure from the tip of the nose
to the earlobe

20:18.581 --> 20:21.584
and down to the xiphoid process,
which is here.

20:22.043 --> 20:25.004
Then I usually mark that off
with some tape.

20:25.547 --> 20:28.258
And then you need to lubricate
the end of the tube

20:28.341 --> 20:31.177
that I'm going to insert about 4 inches.

20:32.554 --> 20:35.598
And then I just slide it in like that.

20:35.682 --> 20:37.420
I have to make sure the end
of the tube is curved

20:37.516 --> 20:39.241
and that his head is a little bent,

20:39.352 --> 20:41.583
a little bent back.

20:43.148 --> 20:46.359
And then we usually hold it in place
with some surgical tape.

20:46.443 --> 20:47.944
And that's it.

20:48.987 --> 20:52.615
If there are any problems
or any bleeding, just call me, okay?

21:48.671 --> 21:52.300
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing you can do.

22:27.210 --> 22:28.336
I want if!

22:28.461 --> 22:31.381
Give me it! Give me it! I want it!

22:31.923 --> 22:33.633
I want it! Now!

22:49.732 --> 22:52.777
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

22:53.820 --> 22:56.990
It's okay. It's okay.

23:00.201 --> 23:02.662
It's okay. It's okay.

23:33.276 --> 23:34.319
What's this?

23:34.902 --> 23:36.112
An award.

23:38.031 --> 23:41.451
That's today's date.
Did you get this today?

23:43.161 --> 23:45.788
Honey, why didn't you tell us?

23:50.960 --> 23:52.105
I know it's hard right now,

23:52.210 --> 23:56.174
but things are going to get better,
I promise.

23:58.718 --> 24:00.053
I'm gonna show this to your dad.

24:00.553 --> 24:02.138
It's fantastic.

24:07.060 --> 24:08.895
I'm scared, Mom.

24:13.107 --> 24:15.735
- Scared of what?
- Dalton.

24:16.444 --> 24:18.237
Can I change rooms?

24:19.447 --> 24:21.949
Why would you want to change rooms?

24:22.075 --> 24:24.994
I don't like
when he walks around at night.

25:38.776 --> 25:41.237
Something really weird happened
to me today.

25:41.529 --> 25:42.780
What?

25:43.364 --> 25:45.658
I heard this noise coming
from Cali's room.

25:46.117 --> 25:49.287
It was on the baby monitor.
It was like voices.

25:49.370 --> 25:53.541
And I ran up here and I had a look,
but there was no one in there.

25:54.876 --> 25:56.836
It was probably just interference.

25:56.919 --> 25:59.255
Those things are always picking up
somebody else's signal.

25:59.338 --> 26:01.424
I don't know. It sounded so clear.

26:01.507 --> 26:03.342
It was like this whispering.

26:03.426 --> 26:06.679
It was... It scared the hell out of me.

26:06.888 --> 26:09.265
I was at the piano,
and I could hear it on the monitor,

26:09.348 --> 26:11.726
and I turned up the volume and...

26:13.978 --> 26:15.396
Who the hell is that?

26:19.233 --> 26:20.443
Hold on.

26:21.402 --> 26:22.528
Stay here.

26:42.006 --> 26:43.341
Who is it?

27:03.569 --> 27:04.737
Jesus.

27:18.501 --> 27:19.794
Hello?

27:54.120 --> 27:56.539
Oh, my God! Josh! Josh! Josh!

27:56.622 --> 27:59.458
Please. Someone's in Cali's room!
Someone's in Cali's room!

27:59.876 --> 28:01.961
There's someone there! I saw somebody!

28:03.796 --> 28:06.299
He was standing right there!
He was standing right there!

28:10.636 --> 28:12.471
- There's nobody here.
- I saw someone!

28:15.141 --> 28:18.352
Okay, take her, get Foster,
go in Dalton's room.

28:33.492 --> 28:34.869
- Foster!
- What's going on?

28:34.952 --> 28:36.871
The alarm's gone off!

29:43.646 --> 29:45.231
God damn it!

30:04.291 --> 30:05.918
Thanks, guys.

30:09.463 --> 30:10.715
I'll see you tomorrow.

30:22.727 --> 30:24.395
Hey, honey. It's me.

30:25.312 --> 30:29.108
They just told me, I've got to... I'm
gonna have to stay late tonight to...

30:29.191 --> 30:32.695
I gotta grade some tests,
and it's gonna be a while so...

30:33.696 --> 30:35.053
You don't have to wait up, okay?

30:35.184 --> 30:38.284
I'll be home as soon as I can.
I love you.

31:15.821 --> 31:19.742
Did he respond to any of the new tests?

31:20.034 --> 31:22.453
No. No, he didn't.

31:23.162 --> 31:25.206
But we have to give it time.

31:25.289 --> 31:27.625
I've seen coma patients
with a much longer inactivity time

31:27.708 --> 31:29.919
suddenly start making noises.

31:31.003 --> 31:35.508
He's not in a coma.
They don't know what to call it.

31:38.427 --> 31:40.679
They don't know what to do with him,

31:41.847 --> 31:43.808
so they've just given up.

31:45.309 --> 31:47.770
I feel like the universe is just

31:48.521 --> 31:51.524
trying to see how far
I'll bend before I break.

31:52.733 --> 31:55.694
Well, the universe picked a fight
with the wrong chick.

31:59.365 --> 32:01.367
That's okay. I got it.

32:02.993 --> 32:04.370
Thank you.

32:12.253 --> 32:13.379
Okay.

32:58.757 --> 33:01.135
Josh, where are you?

33:01.385 --> 33:04.346
I need you to come home now, please.

33:20.112 --> 33:21.447
L' ['S 10230.

33:24.658 --> 33:27.494
You've been coming home late
every single night.

33:28.537 --> 33:31.081
In all the years you've worked at the
school, you've never had to do that.

33:31.165 --> 33:33.834
Why all of a sudden
are you staying back late?

33:33.918 --> 33:37.171
You know, I don't like it either.
I was grading tests. I mean...

33:38.172 --> 33:39.882
What choice do I have?

33:39.965 --> 33:41.967
- I've got to pay Dalton's bills.
- Josh.

33:42.218 --> 33:45.471
I'm scared. I'm so scared and...

33:46.972 --> 33:49.225
I'm scared. He's my son, too.

33:50.059 --> 33:53.020
You don't understand.
I'm scared for Dalton.

33:53.812 --> 33:55.105
I'm scared of this house.

34:00.653 --> 34:02.238
There's something wrong with this place.

34:02.321 --> 34:04.657
I'm not imagining it. I can feel it.

34:05.616 --> 34:06.742
It's like a sickness.

34:06.825 --> 34:10.411
Ever since we've moved in,
everything's just gone wrong.

34:15.251 --> 34:16.793
You think our house is haunted?

34:17.085 --> 34:19.213
I don't think it. I know it.

34:19.463 --> 34:21.257
Things move around in here
by themselves.

34:21.340 --> 34:25.678
I walk into the kitchen at night
to get a drink, I can feel eyes on me.

34:27.012 --> 34:30.474
I can't be in there alone anymore.

34:31.058 --> 34:35.344
I need you. But you're never here.

34:35.562 --> 34:39.358
- Where are you?
- I told you. I was grading tests.

34:40.192 --> 34:44.487
That's not what I mean. You're not here
with me in this situation.

34:44.571 --> 34:46.614
You're just avoiding it,

34:47.574 --> 34:50.619
like everything stressful,
whether it's this or parking tickets.

34:50.703 --> 34:54.623
Oh, God. Stop saying that, okay?
I don't avoid stressful situations.

34:54.706 --> 34:57.793
I'm just dealing with it
in my own fucking way.

35:07.928 --> 35:09.888
Fine. Deal with this!

36:21.126 --> 36:22.294
Jesus.

36:23.128 --> 36:24.380
Oh, God.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.026
Josh?

36:51.407 --> 36:52.491
Josh.

37:08.173 --> 37:09.466
Renai?

37:13.554 --> 37:14.721
Renai!

37:16.557 --> 37:18.851
- What, what, what? What is it?
- There's someone here.

37:18.934 --> 37:20.436
There's someone in the room!

37:21.895 --> 37:24.022
He was right there, I swear!

37:29.319 --> 37:31.530
Don't you dare not believe me.

37:32.406 --> 37:35.325
Please. Please, believe me.

37:35.492 --> 37:37.369
I swear he was right there.

37:38.036 --> 37:39.872
I do, I do. I do believe you.

37:39.997 --> 37:42.082
I just don't know
what you want me to do.

37:42.207 --> 37:45.419
I want to leave. Please.
I want to leave this house.

37:45.502 --> 37:47.838
I can't spend
another night here. Please!

37:48.338 --> 37:51.008
- Please, help me!
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:52.551 --> 37:54.052
We're going.

38:15.991 --> 38:18.660
Lorraine, please, you shouldn't be
doing any of this. Just sit down.

38:18.744 --> 38:20.829
I'm perfectly capable
of putting a few things away.

38:20.913 --> 38:22.289
I did it for Josh his Whole life.

38:22.372 --> 38:24.875
I know, but I feel terrible.

38:26.710 --> 38:30.672
I think it's you who should be
sitting down by the looks of it.

38:34.676 --> 38:37.429
I can't believe you got Josh
to hold still for a photo.

38:38.430 --> 38:42.518
What I can't believe is that
we are doing this all over again.

38:43.685 --> 38:45.062
Ridiculous.

38:49.942 --> 38:52.027
You must think I'm crazy.

38:53.028 --> 38:54.238
Nobody,

38:54.863 --> 38:58.617
not me or anybody, knows
what you're going through right now.

38:59.076 --> 39:02.287
Whatever you have to do
to get through it, do it.

39:03.747 --> 39:06.667
And you don't have to apologize
for anything.

39:10.128 --> 39:11.421
Thanks.

42:28.702 --> 42:29.911
Dalton?

43:18.835 --> 43:22.422
Your faith can help. Trust it, you know.

43:23.215 --> 43:25.217
- Hello.
- Josh.

43:27.719 --> 43:29.095
This is the first line of a joke, right?

43:29.179 --> 43:31.890
A guy comes home to find his wife
with a priest.

43:32.724 --> 43:34.976
- This is Liam Martin.
- Nice to meet you.

43:35.109 --> 43:37.268
He's actually a very old friend of mine.

43:37.687 --> 43:40.816
- This is my husband, Josh.
- What's going on here?

43:40.899 --> 43:41.983
- I should be going.
- Thank you.

43:42.067 --> 43:43.068
Thank you so much.

43:43.151 --> 43:45.403
Thank you so much for the tea.

43:48.406 --> 43:51.409
This thing from the other house

43:52.869 --> 43:54.579
has followed us here.

43:54.788 --> 43:58.416
I saw something today.

43:58.875 --> 44:02.504
I thought it was a little boy.
I followed it into Dalton's room.

44:02.587 --> 44:05.757
But it wasn't a child.
It was something else.

44:06.800 --> 44:11.304
So what? You just
brought a priest in to get rid of it?

44:12.305 --> 44:14.099
I didn't know what else to do, Josh.

44:14.391 --> 44:15.934
Come on, Renal.

44:16.601 --> 44:19.187
When's the last time you went to church?

44:21.940 --> 44:24.442
What's happening to Renai is real.

44:25.318 --> 44:26.820
I've seen it for myself.

44:29.698 --> 44:33.869
I came today because last night
I had a dream about this place.

44:35.495 --> 44:38.790
I was in this house,
but it was late at night.

44:42.252 --> 44:44.296
I was afraid.

44:50.302 --> 44:53.597
I went into your bedroom,
but you were both asleep.

44:57.017 --> 44:59.769
I knew I was asleep in the dream,

45:00.520 --> 45:03.773
but I could feel that
someone was awake

45:04.566 --> 45:06.026
in the house.

45:08.653 --> 45:10.196
I went into Dalton's room.

45:23.501 --> 45:25.003
There was something in there with him.

45:29.925 --> 45:31.968
It was standing there in the corner.

45:36.681 --> 45:39.559
I asked it, "Who are you?"

45:39.643 --> 45:42.687
And it said it was a visitor.

45:44.606 --> 45:46.232
I said, "What do you want?"

45:52.864 --> 45:54.115
It said, "Dalton."

46:00.038 --> 46:02.207
I can still hear that voice.

46:07.587 --> 46:08.880
What? What?

46:09.422 --> 46:11.424
- It's here!
- What?

46:38.952 --> 46:40.161
Jesus!

46:40.412 --> 46:41.538
Oh, my God!

46:46.876 --> 46:48.420
Okay. He's okay.

46:48.753 --> 46:51.548
Please! Please, help him! Please!

46:56.302 --> 46:57.554
I know someone who can help

46:59.848 --> 47:02.017
if you're willing to ask.

47:08.189 --> 47:10.233
I'm Specs. This is Tucker.

47:11.276 --> 47:12.527
- I'm Renai. Hi.
- Hi.

47:12.610 --> 47:14.779
- You must be Josh.
- Yeah. Hi.

47:15.405 --> 47:18.491
That wasn't psychic.
Elise already told me your name so...

47:18.950 --> 47:20.452
Where is Elise?

47:20.535 --> 47:23.204
She sent us ahead
to do some preliminary tests.

47:23.621 --> 47:25.832
Helps weed out the nut jobs.

47:34.049 --> 47:36.718
- What is that?
- It's a Trifield meter.

47:36.801 --> 47:38.511
Measures DC fields

47:38.595 --> 47:41.973
and the natural
electromagnetic environment.

47:43.016 --> 47:46.061
Yeah, sometimes old wiring
can leak into the atmosphere.

47:46.144 --> 47:48.813
It causes hallucinations,
changes in energy.

47:49.147 --> 47:51.900
It's a little more important than that,
but whatever.

47:52.192 --> 47:54.444
The tech stuff's not really relevant
to you guys anyway.

47:54.527 --> 47:55.653
It's all very relevant, actually.

48:09.375 --> 48:10.502
What?

48:11.836 --> 48:13.505
Starfleet Series One.

48:15.924 --> 48:17.050
It's hard to find.

48:17.801 --> 48:20.095
Should have kept it in its box.

48:23.348 --> 48:26.017
This device measures changes
in UV light.

48:26.392 --> 48:28.019
I make all this equipment myself,
you know.

48:29.270 --> 48:30.438
It's impressive.

48:30.980 --> 48:32.273
Thanks.

48:33.733 --> 48:36.401
It's not that hard
if you know what you're doing.

48:37.028 --> 48:40.156
Yeah,
that one's basically a modified toy.

48:43.701 --> 48:46.037
I'm gonna need some time alone
to concentrate.

49:57.400 --> 50:00.361
This field is...
Look, the body is made up of energy.

50:00.445 --> 50:04.157
- Where does that energy go when we die?
- We can call Elise.

50:05.158 --> 50:06.242
Now.

50:10.955 --> 50:13.708
I wasn't sure the doorbell was working.
I'm sorry.

50:13.791 --> 50:15.210
- That's fine. Come on in.
- Thank you.

50:15.293 --> 50:16.794
Mrs. Rainier?

50:16.878 --> 50:19.547
No, Mrs. Rainier is my mother.
Just call me Elise.

50:19.797 --> 50:21.799
- I'm Josh.
- I knew that.

50:22.508 --> 50:24.260
You've grown since I last saw you.

50:25.136 --> 50:26.638
Since you last saw me?

50:26.930 --> 50:30.016
Your mother and I have been friends
a long time.

50:31.768 --> 50:34.145
- Well, hello.
- This is my wife, Renai.

50:34.229 --> 50:36.272
- How do you do?
- Hi, thank you for coming.

50:36.356 --> 50:39.067
- Thank you for having me.
- Can we get you anything, Elise?

50:39.150 --> 50:41.236
No, I'm fine, thank you so much.

50:41.569 --> 50:44.989
We took Trifield and EMF readings
of the whole house,

50:45.073 --> 50:47.909
all the wiring,
alarm clocks, radios, toasters,

50:47.992 --> 50:52.914
TV, record player, fuse box, nothing
went off the charts except for the...

50:52.997 --> 50:54.165
And the previous home?

50:55.375 --> 50:57.835
Tucker hadn't monitored that yet.
You know what? Don't even sweat it.

50:57.919 --> 51:00.296
I'll make myself available.
I'll get on that this afternoon.

51:00.380 --> 51:02.715
Yeah, but I'll have to come, too,

51:02.799 --> 51:04.509
because who's going to operate
the equipment?

51:04.592 --> 51:06.970
Well, strictly, I could do it without...

51:07.053 --> 51:09.013
- Yeah, but I need to oversee...
- Yeah, but it's not...

51:09.097 --> 51:10.269
That's fine, gentlemen.

51:11.125 --> 51:13.926
I don't think bad wiring
is the problem here.

51:16.729 --> 51:18.523
May I walk through the house?

51:18.606 --> 51:20.233
- Sure, of course.
- Thank you.

51:21.150 --> 51:22.860
Your other children
are with Lorraine, right?

51:22.944 --> 51:24.529
Yeah, they are.

51:25.822 --> 51:27.156
Steven, do you have your sketchbook?

51:27.448 --> 51:28.574
Yes. Yes, I do.

51:29.033 --> 51:31.160
Good. 'Cause we're gonna need it.

51:31.244 --> 51:33.037
What do you need that for?

51:33.788 --> 51:35.498
She tells me what she sees,
and I draw it.

51:35.581 --> 51:37.667
It's the most important part
of her process.

51:37.959 --> 51:39.794
- That's debatable.
- It's not debatable.

51:39.877 --> 51:41.629
It is, but whatever.

51:46.175 --> 51:47.885
Leave the light off.

52:01.399 --> 52:02.775
Hey, Dalton.

52:04.902 --> 52:07.196
You are a very handsome boy.

52:08.614 --> 52:11.659
Your mom and dad are here,
so don't you worry.

52:27.675 --> 52:29.218
What? What...

52:32.847 --> 52:33.931
The face...

52:34.807 --> 52:35.808
What?

52:36.726 --> 52:38.269
Blood red face.

52:39.103 --> 52:41.898
Black... Black arms. Black legs.

52:42.774 --> 52:44.317
Black body.

52:51.491 --> 52:52.658
Slow down.

52:52.742 --> 52:54.952
- His feet are black. His legs are black.
- Slow down.

52:57.288 --> 52:58.331
What is it?

52:59.415 --> 53:00.833
Oh, my God.

53:04.754 --> 53:07.924
And pitch black eyes.
They're like two dark holes.

53:12.261 --> 53:14.180
He has hooves for feet.

53:15.264 --> 53:18.226
- What?
- And long spidery fingernails.

53:18.309 --> 53:19.394
Elise, what's......

53:20.311 --> 53:21.521
Hey, what is that?

53:40.081 --> 53:43.084
I'm not sure if you're ready
to hear this yet,

53:43.167 --> 53:47.171
but unfortunately, I can't waste
any time easing you into it.

53:48.756 --> 53:51.050
I want you to know,
this is what I believe,

53:51.134 --> 53:54.887
and it may contradict
a previous medical diagnosis, but...

53:55.138 --> 54:00.226
You called me here, and I'm taking that
as an acceptance of my readings. Yes?

54:03.187 --> 54:04.564
Yes, go on.

54:09.193 --> 54:10.945
Your son isn't in a coma.

54:11.028 --> 54:13.948
Falling off a ladder
had nothing to do with this.

54:14.031 --> 54:16.200
His physical body's here.

54:17.076 --> 54:19.120
But his spiritual body is not.

54:19.203 --> 54:23.291
And the reason these disturbances,
they followed you to a new home,

54:24.208 --> 54:27.211
is because it's not the house
that's haunted.

54:30.173 --> 54:31.674
It's your son.

54:36.596 --> 54:38.389
I don't understand.

54:41.267 --> 54:42.935
Have you ever heard
of astral projection?

54:44.520 --> 54:47.899
Yes. It's out of body experience
or something?

54:49.108 --> 54:50.985
I like to call them travelers.

54:52.487 --> 54:56.616
You see, these are people with the
ability to leave their physical body

54:57.074 --> 55:00.244
and to travel to different places
in astral form.

55:00.953 --> 55:02.413
Now, Dalton,

55:03.331 --> 55:06.959
he is a very accomplished
astral projector.

55:08.419 --> 55:11.506
He's been doing it in his sleep
for a long time.

55:12.381 --> 55:14.634
He has been since he was very young.

55:15.593 --> 55:18.554
And he's unafraid
because he thinks they're dreams.

55:19.138 --> 55:23.809
And it's that very lack of fear
that has led him to travel too far.

55:24.644 --> 55:26.646
And to become lost.

55:27.480 --> 55:28.606
Lost?

55:31.359 --> 55:32.735
Lost where?

55:33.778 --> 55:36.322
In a place that I call the Further.

55:36.447 --> 55:38.574
What? What does that mean?

55:39.992 --> 55:43.079
The Further is a world
far beyond our own,

55:43.287 --> 55:44.622
yet it's all around us,

55:45.331 --> 55:47.458
a place without time as we know it.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.712
It's a dark realm filled with
the tortured souls of the dead,

55:52.755 --> 55:54.507
a place not meant for the living.

55:57.969 --> 55:59.887
That's where Dalton is.

56:01.097 --> 56:04.016
And the problem
is that with his astral body gone,

56:04.100 --> 56:07.645
he's just left us with a physical body,
an empty vessel.

56:08.354 --> 56:11.566
And there are entities that know this
because they can smell it.

56:12.066 --> 56:14.735
That's why they're gathered around him.

56:14.819 --> 56:17.321
Are these the things that
I've been seeing?

56:23.911 --> 56:28.040
They're all trying to get inside of
his physical body simply because they...

56:28.124 --> 56:29.709
They crave life,

56:30.042 --> 56:31.711
the chance to live again.

56:32.086 --> 56:34.338
But there are other entities

56:34.880 --> 56:36.507
who are malevolent

56:38.175 --> 56:40.511
and have a more insidious agenda.

56:41.846 --> 56:44.056
And then, there's this.

56:46.350 --> 56:51.105
A demon who seeks Dalton's body
for one reason:

56:52.148 --> 56:54.191
to cause pain to others.

56:57.486 --> 56:59.113
He is so desperate to possess Dalton,

56:59.196 --> 57:02.158
and he's the closest of all the entities
to getting inside of him.

57:02.241 --> 57:03.909
What do you mean the closest?

57:03.993 --> 57:07.663
Because these entities, they can't
just walk into the bodies of the living

57:07.747 --> 57:09.040
anytime they please.

57:09.123 --> 57:12.793
To cross over from their realm,
it takes time. It takes energy.

57:12.877 --> 57:16.088
But the longer that Dalton's astral body

57:16.422 --> 57:20.593
is kept away from his physical body,
the weaker the link gets.

57:22.553 --> 57:24.555
The easier it is to possess him.

57:25.139 --> 57:28.517
Is there anything we can do
to bring Dalton back?

57:33.731 --> 57:35.066
There's something we could try.

57:36.192 --> 57:38.235
It's a little unorthodox.

57:39.987 --> 57:42.573
But I would need your complete trust.

57:42.907 --> 57:45.368
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, this has gone too far.

57:45.451 --> 57:47.536
What? No, please, Josh.
You said you would give her a chance.

57:47.542 --> 57:50.612
I have given her a chance, honey, but I
can't have somebody coming into our home

57:50.625 --> 57:52.750
and telling us the reason
our son is in a coma

57:52.833 --> 57:56.003
is because his soul has floated off
somewhere in another dimension.

57:56.087 --> 57:59.924
We're gonna bring her all the way here
and not even consider what she's saying?

58:00.007 --> 58:04.178
I did this to make sure you could feel
at ease. And if it helped, great.

58:05.012 --> 58:09.266
I've listened to the dog and pony show.
I have seen the drawings.

58:09.350 --> 58:10.976
But to bring Dalton into it, no.

58:11.060 --> 58:12.687
But why is our son still in a coma?

58:12.770 --> 58:15.022
Why can't the doctors tell us
what is wrong with him?

58:15.106 --> 58:17.858
How did the voice of reason
become the bad guy here?

58:17.983 --> 58:20.695
Don't you see, Renai?
You want to believe. Anybody would.

58:20.778 --> 58:23.739
You don't believe me!
You don't believe me!

58:27.618 --> 58:29.537
I moved houses for you.

58:30.079 --> 58:33.874
What do you mean, I don't believe you?
I'm on your side here.

58:36.001 --> 58:40.548
But this,
this is dangerous and exploitative.

58:41.215 --> 58:44.051
You guys come into the home
of a seriously ill child,

58:44.135 --> 58:48.055
and you make some tenuous connection
between him

58:48.139 --> 58:51.475
and the images my wife is seeing,
and voila!

58:52.309 --> 58:55.730
Tears validate your power, and thank you
very much, that will be $600 please.

58:56.021 --> 58:57.106
- Thank you for coming.
- Please. Please.

58:57.189 --> 59:00.317
- Thank you. No, I really understand.
- Please.

59:00.401 --> 59:03.154
Thank you for your hospitality.
Good luck.

59:03.571 --> 59:04.989
Oh, Jesus!

59:05.823 --> 59:07.575
Sorry to waste your time.

59:11.662 --> 59:13.122
Where are you, buddy?

59:16.459 --> 59:18.586
Did you go somewhere?

59:20.337 --> 59:21.380
No.

59:23.132 --> 59:27.344
No, you're right here.
You are right here.

59:30.723 --> 59:32.391
Can you hear me?

59:35.436 --> 59:38.773
I know you can hear me,
but you gotta show me, okay, buddy?

59:39.023 --> 59:41.984
You gotta show me that you can hear me.

01:00:55.891 --> 01:00:57.017
Okay.

01:01:10.364 --> 01:01:13.617
What's most important is that you
realize no two attempts are the same.

01:01:13.951 --> 01:01:16.871
I'm going to be completely honest
with you about the results.

01:01:16.954 --> 01:01:19.498
If there's no dialogue established,
I'm gonna tell you.

01:01:22.126 --> 01:01:25.921
These still cameras are rigged to
pick up any changes in the atmosphere,

01:01:26.005 --> 01:01:29.341
both electrical or temperature-wise.

01:01:30.718 --> 01:01:32.136
Don't be alarmed if they go off

01:01:33.971 --> 01:01:36.105
You're gonna see
a lot of confusing things,

01:01:36.204 --> 01:01:37.438
things you don't understand.

01:01:37.518 --> 01:01:41.186
But do not question them
and do not speak in any way.

01:01:41.729 --> 01:01:43.898
I want you to know whatever I say
when I'm in tune

01:01:43.981 --> 01:01:46.483
is going to be at a very low volume.
You won't hear any of it.

01:01:46.567 --> 01:01:50.529
But Steven's gonna write it down.
He's going repeat it for you. Okay?

01:01:52.406 --> 01:01:53.866
Dim the lights, please.

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:43.749
We are calling out to you, Dalton.

01:02:46.543 --> 01:02:49.046
Tell us you're safe.
Tell us where you are.

01:02:49.129 --> 01:02:51.215
Tell us you're safe.
Tell us where you are.

01:02:58.389 --> 01:02:59.598
Dalton.

01:03:01.392 --> 01:03:04.103
Can you hear us? Answer us.

01:03:21.745 --> 01:03:22.955
Who's there?

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.175
Dalton, it's your mother and father.

01:03:38.929 --> 01:03:40.431
We've been searching for you.

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:43.392
Where are you?

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:54.153
I can't see in here.

01:03:54.945 --> 01:03:57.698
Dalton... Dalton, you don't need to see.

01:03:58.782 --> 01:04:00.868
Follow my voice.

01:04:02.619 --> 01:04:04.580
Follow my voice, Dalton.

01:04:07.958 --> 01:04:10.461
Dalton. Why aren't you...

01:04:10.919 --> 01:04:12.796
Why aren't you talking anymore?

01:04:14.131 --> 01:04:15.299
Dalton?

01:04:20.929 --> 01:04:25.017
If they hear me, they'll hurt me.

01:04:26.143 --> 01:04:27.436
Who will hurt you?

01:04:28.645 --> 01:04:30.022
Who will hurt you, Dalton?

01:04:36.153 --> 01:04:37.488
The man

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:41.325
with

01:04:42.743 --> 01:04:43.911
fire

01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:50.167
on his face.

01:04:55.005 --> 01:04:56.215
Dalton.

01:04:56.965 --> 01:04:58.383
Dalton, can you find your way out?

01:05:00.344 --> 01:05:01.762
There is

01:05:02.429 --> 01:05:05.307
no way out.

01:05:06.767 --> 01:05:11.021
Follow my voice, Dalton.
Follow my voice.

01:05:12.523 --> 01:05:14.525
Be quiet.

01:05:15.609 --> 01:05:17.945
They'll hear you.

01:05:18.362 --> 01:05:21.073
They won't hear me, Dalton.
Follow my voice.

01:05:21.949 --> 01:05:23.534
Follow my voice.

01:05:25.077 --> 01:05:28.622
They heard you.

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.918
Oh, my God.

01:05:33.377 --> 01:05:36.547
Mommy and Daddy.

01:05:37.631 --> 01:05:39.174
Help. Help.

01:05:40.843 --> 01:05:45.722
Help me, help me, help.

01:05:49.143 --> 01:05:50.227
Dalton?

01:06:02.072 --> 01:06:04.408
You bitch.

01:07:05.093 --> 01:07:06.178
Dalton?

01:07:40.837 --> 01:07:41.964
Specs!

01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:54.184
Leave this vessel!

01:07:55.018 --> 01:07:56.520
- He's alive. He's alive, oh, God.
- He's alive? Jesus.

01:08:07.155 --> 01:08:08.907
Leave this vessel!

01:08:10.325 --> 01:08:13.745
Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel!

01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:15.789
Leave his body!

01:08:15.872 --> 01:08:17.749
Tucker, turn on the light!

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:21.169
Leave this body now!

01:08:27.384 --> 01:08:29.303
Come here, Dalton.

01:08:31.388 --> 01:08:32.889
Son. Come here.

01:08:35.142 --> 01:08:38.060
- He's alive. He's alive, oh, God.
- He's alive? Jesus.

01:08:38.312 --> 01:08:40.229
- Honey.
- Oh, God.

01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:50.073
Three cameras. Around the clock.
We got nothing.

01:08:52.743 --> 01:08:55.162
But I did find this on the video.

01:08:56.078 --> 01:08:57.497
Take a look.

01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:00.500
Take a look.

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.546
You see that?

01:09:05.464 --> 01:09:06.923
I went through it.

01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:09.343
Frame by frame

01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:12.095
By frame.

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:14.890
Oh, my God.

01:09:22.731 --> 01:09:24.274
- Who's that?
- I'll get it.

01:09:26.276 --> 01:09:27.611
Hi, Lorraine.

01:09:28.653 --> 01:09:30.363
Mom, what are you doing here?

01:09:30.988 --> 01:09:32.491
I asked your mother to come over.

01:09:32.573 --> 01:09:34.868
I called her immediately
after the session.

01:09:34.951 --> 01:09:37.828
- Why?
- There's something we must talk about.

01:09:38.497 --> 01:09:40.247
Lorraine, have a seat.

01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:49.424
Go on. Tell him.

01:09:51.134 --> 01:09:52.511
Tell me what, Mom?

01:09:54.136 --> 01:09:55.472
The reason

01:09:56.306 --> 01:10:00.811
I knew to call Elise in this situation,
the reason I know her so well,

01:10:02.145 --> 01:10:05.440
is because I called her myself once,
years ago,

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.276
to help you.

01:10:09.986 --> 01:10:11.154
What are you talking about, Mom?

01:10:11.238 --> 01:10:14.574
It's no accident
that your son is a gifted traveler.

01:10:15.909 --> 01:10:17.994
The ability was handed down to him.

01:10:18.453 --> 01:10:19.538
By his father.

01:10:21.123 --> 01:10:22.249
Me?

01:10:27.129 --> 01:10:29.172
No, I don't do... I can't do that.

01:10:29.256 --> 01:10:33.343
When you were about eight,
you suffered night terrors,

01:10:33.427 --> 01:10:37.305
These awful fits of pure fear.

01:10:47.858 --> 01:10:52.571
You were terrified of an old woman you
said used to come visit you at night.

01:10:57.701 --> 01:11:00.078
I dismissed your stories. I...

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:03.248
I told you to grow up.

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:07.544
And then I saw her for myself.

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:37.616
At first,
I thought it was a camera problem.

01:11:41.703 --> 01:11:43.038
And then I saw her again.

01:11:56.092 --> 01:11:57.302
In each photo,

01:11:58.929 --> 01:12:00.096
she got closer

01:12:04.142 --> 01:12:05.310
and closer

01:12:10.524 --> 01:12:12.234
and closer to you.

01:12:13.276 --> 01:12:16.112
Finally, I was so frightened,
I found Elise.

01:12:16.947 --> 01:12:20.617
Do you remember
any of this, honey, do you?

01:12:22.953 --> 01:12:25.997
No. I don't.

01:12:26.206 --> 01:12:29.292
Suppressing your memory
and your ability to astral project

01:12:29.376 --> 01:12:32.671
was the only way to stop her
from getting into you.

01:12:34.214 --> 01:12:36.091
But in the back of your mind,

01:12:36.174 --> 01:12:39.886
you're still afraid to have
your picture taken, aren't you?

01:12:40.262 --> 01:12:42.931
I kept those photos
hidden from you ever since.

01:12:44.182 --> 01:12:46.601
I advised Lorraine to hide them,

01:12:47.227 --> 01:12:50.814
to stop taking your picture,
to just let you forget.

01:12:53.733 --> 01:12:56.152
- Who is she?
- A parasite.

01:12:58.572 --> 01:13:00.865
She befriended your astral body

01:13:00.949 --> 01:13:05.245
and then drew you out into the Further,
just as Dalton has been drawn out.

01:13:07.163 --> 01:13:08.957
I'm so sorry, Josh.

01:13:11.167 --> 01:13:13.253
I didn't want to
make you remember all this.

01:13:13.336 --> 01:13:15.380
I do it for the sake of your son.

01:13:16.923 --> 01:13:18.383
Your son is out there.

01:13:19.509 --> 01:13:22.637
And you are the only one
that can bring him back.

01:13:22.721 --> 01:13:24.139
And with what we saw tonight,

01:13:24.222 --> 01:13:27.058
I would say he doesn't
have much time left to wait for you.

01:13:30.687 --> 01:13:31.855
Okay.

01:13:39.946 --> 01:13:41.865
You've always been stronger than me.

01:13:42.866 --> 01:13:44.492
You can do this.

01:13:47.912 --> 01:13:49.873
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:13:56.504 --> 01:13:58.131
Please come back.

01:14:01.009 --> 01:14:03.386
Remember why you're traveling

01:14:04.262 --> 01:14:07.932
and keep one foot in this world.
Do not draw attention to yourself.

01:14:08.892 --> 01:14:10.727
If they realize you are not one of them,

01:14:11.311 --> 01:14:14.064
they will come for your physical body
in this world.

01:14:15.106 --> 01:14:17.233
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:14:18.234 --> 01:14:21.905
I don't know what I'm ready for,
but... Okay.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.584
Close your eyes, Josh,
take a deep breath, and relax.

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:38.755
With each breath,

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.425
let the life around you
fade into the background.

01:14:43.927 --> 01:14:47.180
Just listen to the ticking
of the metronome.

01:14:47.764 --> 01:14:50.767
Focus on the spot
in the center of your forehead.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.938
The universe is deathless.

01:14:56.272 --> 01:15:01.277
It is deathless because having
no finite self, it stays infinite.

01:15:03.738 --> 01:15:07.909
A sound man, by not advancing himself,

01:15:08.243 --> 01:15:11.204
stays the further ahead of himself.

01:15:26.803 --> 01:15:29.055
It's useless.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:15:37.814 --> 01:15:39.983
Now you're outside.

01:15:40.859 --> 01:15:43.403
Let my voice be your guide.

01:15:44.195 --> 01:15:46.656
Keep a steady stride.

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:50.160
Into the Further you go.

01:17:11.574 --> 01:17:12.617
Dalton.

01:17:56.119 --> 01:17:57.328
He's in.

01:18:07.338 --> 01:18:08.590
Dalton!

01:18:18.725 --> 01:18:19.976
Hello?

01:18:22.937 --> 01:18:24.105
Hello?

01:18:29.819 --> 01:18:30.904
Wait!

01:18:46.252 --> 01:18:47.462
Hello?

01:19:06.356 --> 01:19:07.565
Hello?

01:19:10.693 --> 01:19:11.861
Hello?

01:19:16.866 --> 01:19:18.785
I'm looking for my son Dalton.

01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:50.043
Dalton!

01:20:51.461 --> 01:20:52.670
Dalton!

01:21:07.935 --> 01:21:09.479
Where's my son?

01:21:11.147 --> 01:21:12.815
Tell me where my son is.

01:21:13.191 --> 01:21:14.275
Please.

01:22:47.118 --> 01:22:48.494
What's happening to him?

01:23:03.509 --> 01:23:04.719
Jesus.

01:23:08.598 --> 01:23:10.183
Help him, Elise! Please!

01:23:12.268 --> 01:23:13.936
You're stronger than they are, Josh.

01:23:15.021 --> 01:23:17.273
You can beat them. You are stronger.
You are the one alive.

01:23:18.566 --> 01:23:19.859
Get away from me!

01:24:25.424 --> 01:24:27.426
- Dalton!
- Daddy?

01:24:27.885 --> 01:24:29.637
- Oh, God! Buddy!
- Daddy!

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.430
- Oh, my God! Oh, buddy.
- Daddy.

01:24:31.514 --> 01:24:33.224
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy.

01:24:33.349 --> 01:24:35.768
Oh, buddy, it's okay.

01:24:35.851 --> 01:24:38.104
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Oh, God.

01:24:38.729 --> 01:24:41.524
- Daddy, look. I'm chained.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:24:41.691 --> 01:24:43.317
Face me, buddy. Face me. Come here.

01:24:43.401 --> 01:24:45.820
We'll get you out.
We'll get you out, buddy, okay?

01:24:45.903 --> 01:24:48.322
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

01:24:50.658 --> 01:24:52.660
What? What?

01:25:26.402 --> 01:25:27.737
Oh, Gad. Okay.

01:25:28.237 --> 01:25:30.031
It's okay. Listen to me. Look at me.

01:25:30.114 --> 01:25:31.907
None of this is real, okay?
This is not real.

01:25:31.991 --> 01:25:33.451
Look at me. Look at my eyes, buddy.

01:25:33.534 --> 01:25:35.578
None of this is real.
We're going to go home, okay?

01:25:35.661 --> 01:25:36.912
You gotta help me.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.748
There's one.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.128
Oh, my God, Dad. He's looking.

01:26:10.988 --> 01:26:13.824
Come on, baby. Stay here, baby.
Come on, stay with us.

01:26:34.637 --> 01:26:35.846
Daddy!

01:26:50.027 --> 01:26:51.404
He's made contact.

01:26:53.864 --> 01:26:55.366
Grab the light!

01:27:08.295 --> 01:27:09.547
He found your son.

01:27:10.506 --> 01:27:11.590
I know it.

01:27:11.674 --> 01:27:13.426
Well, then wake them up, for God sake!

01:27:13.676 --> 01:27:15.803
I can't. He needs to find us.

01:27:30.443 --> 01:27:32.027
I'm scared, Dad.

01:27:44.999 --> 01:27:47.460
No! Stop!

01:27:58.053 --> 01:28:00.222
Please, Elise, do something!

01:28:08.063 --> 01:28:09.732
Renai, you must call out to him.

01:28:10.816 --> 01:28:13.569
Josh. Josh. Follow my voice!

01:28:14.904 --> 01:28:16.572
Follow my voice, honey.

01:28:17.239 --> 01:28:18.657
Get away! Get away!

01:28:18.949 --> 01:28:20.034
Come back to us!

01:28:20.576 --> 01:28:22.328
Follow my voice, Josh.

01:28:22.411 --> 01:28:24.246
Daddy! Listen, I think it's Mommy!

01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:27.249
Josh, come back to me. Follow my voice.

01:28:27.917 --> 01:28:29.543
Josh, follow my voice.

01:28:30.503 --> 01:28:32.379
Follow my voice, Josh.

01:28:43.265 --> 01:28:44.683
Follow my voice.

01:30:34.293 --> 01:30:36.670
There's something in there! In there!

01:30:36.754 --> 01:30:37.921
Elise!

01:30:38.547 --> 01:30:40.549
Steven, Lorraine, go check on Dalton.

01:30:40.633 --> 01:30:42.593
- What?
- Go check on Dalton.

01:30:42.676 --> 01:30:44.803
- What?
- Go check on Dalton now!

01:31:34.603 --> 01:31:36.522
They're crossing over into our world.

01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:54.707
- Elise!
- Tucker!

01:31:55.624 --> 01:31:58.252
No, you have to shine the light on Josh.

01:32:02.881 --> 01:32:03.966
Come on!

01:32:05.592 --> 01:32:06.635
Let's go around back.

01:32:06.802 --> 01:32:08.887
Shine the light on Josh! On Josh!

01:32:09.346 --> 01:32:10.681
Tucker, on Josh!

01:32:10.764 --> 01:32:12.808
- You've got to call him back!
- Josh!

01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:16.520
Josh! Josh!
Come back to us, Josh, please!

01:32:18.731 --> 01:32:20.524
Josh! Josh! Come back, please!

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.529
Come on, Dad!
Come on, he's right behind us!

01:32:25.612 --> 01:32:27.906
- We have to go!
- I'm right behind you! Go!

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:37.624
You.

01:33:22.544 --> 01:33:23.796
What do you want from me?

01:33:24.421 --> 01:33:25.881
What do you want from me?

01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:28.258
I'm not scared of you.

01:33:29.009 --> 01:33:30.677
I'm not scared of you anymore.

01:33:30.969 --> 01:33:32.721
You can get away from me.

01:33:33.096 --> 01:33:36.725
Get the hell away from me!
Get away from me!

01:33:37.851 --> 01:33:39.853
Get away from me!

01:33:40.521 --> 01:33:41.605
Leave me alone!

01:33:41.814 --> 01:33:43.732
Please, please, please!

01:33:43.899 --> 01:33:45.567
Come back to us! Follow my voice!

01:33:45.776 --> 01:33:47.569
Follow my voice! Please, honey!

01:33:47.736 --> 01:33:49.321
Josh, come back! Come back to us!

01:33:49.446 --> 01:33:50.906
Get the hell away from me!

01:33:52.741 --> 01:33:55.244
Please, Josh, please,
come back to us, please!

01:33:55.410 --> 01:33:58.163
Follow my voice!
Follow my voice! Please!

01:33:59.289 --> 01:34:02.751
Josh, please! Come back, please!

01:34:03.001 --> 01:34:04.419
Leave me alone!

01:34:59.850 --> 01:35:01.560
I've got Dalton. He's awake!

01:35:01.643 --> 01:35:02.811
Oh, my boy!

01:35:03.478 --> 01:35:05.564
He's okay! He's okay!

01:35:06.106 --> 01:35:07.774
We did it, buddy.

01:35:16.158 --> 01:35:17.951
You're back. You're back.

01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:31.465
Dude, I got some amazing shots.

01:35:31.548 --> 01:35:34.092
You're gonna write a book,

01:35:34.176 --> 01:35:37.512
and my photos
are gonna be the main selling point.

01:35:38.013 --> 01:35:40.807
Not the main selling point,
but they'll definitely be important.

01:35:40.891 --> 01:35:42.184
They will be important.

01:35:43.143 --> 01:35:44.770
A picture's worth a thousand words.

01:35:44.853 --> 01:35:47.856
Yeah, but words
are worth a thousand words, too.

01:35:51.193 --> 01:35:52.986
You're really hungry, aren't you?

01:35:53.654 --> 01:35:55.165
And I'm tired, too.

01:35:55.712 --> 01:35:57.013
You're tired?

01:35:57.532 --> 01:35:59.534
- No, you can't be tired.
- Yes, I can.

01:35:59.618 --> 01:36:01.745
No, you've been asleep for far too long.
And you know what?

01:36:01.828 --> 01:36:03.080
I'm never letting you go to sleep again.

01:36:05.582 --> 01:36:07.209
You showed me a new world.

01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:09.628
No, I didn't.

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.589
You've been there before, remember?

01:36:17.052 --> 01:36:19.096
Well, let's hope I forget again.

01:36:20.263 --> 01:36:22.724
Guess I don't need these anymore.

01:36:29.523 --> 01:36:30.649
What?

01:36:31.066 --> 01:36:32.275
Nothing.

01:36:32.943 --> 01:36:35.070
I'm gonna get rid of these.

01:36:35.737 --> 01:36:36.947
All right.

01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.171
Why did you do that?

01:36:54.381 --> 01:36:57.676
Why would you do that to me
when you know how I feel about that?

01:36:57.759 --> 01:36:59.511
Why? Why?

01:37:00.262 --> 01:37:01.930
Why? Why?

01:37:02.014 --> 01:37:04.182
Why? Why? Why?

01:37:04.266 --> 01:37:05.434
No, you're not tired.

01:37:05.517 --> 01:37:07.894
In fact, you're never going to
sleep again. You have to stay awake

01:37:07.978 --> 01:37:09.312
- for the rest of your life, with me.
- No.

01:37:10.731 --> 01:37:12.592
Why? Why? Why?

01:37:19.781 --> 01:37:21.425
You bitch!

01:37:26.621 --> 01:37:28.957
- Can you watch him, Lorraine?
- Sure.

01:37:33.128 --> 01:37:34.379
Elise.

01:37:42.888 --> 01:37:45.474
Josh! Josh!

01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:48.896
Josh, where are you?

01:37:50.134 --> 01:37:51.207
Josh!

01:37:53.148 --> 01:37:54.983
Honey, please... Josh!

01:37:59.654 --> 01:38:00.906
Josh?

01:38:03.992 --> 01:38:05.494
Oh, Jesus.

01:38:32.187 --> 01:38:33.345
Renai,

01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:34.957
I'm right here.
