- Get what from?

All right, so what gossip

I was just checking

01:49.174 --> 01:51.110
a pedicure only.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.612
We need to be hands free,

02:02.522 --> 02:05.579

02:06.159 --> 02:09.461
- My dad's been very helpful

02:06.159 --> 02:09.461
in managing my business,

02:09.496 --> 02:12.765
but to say that he's relentless

02:09.496 --> 02:12.765
is an understatement.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.366
- Understatement of the year.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.868
- I mean,

02:14.401 --> 02:15.868
all I wanted to do today

02:15.901 --> 02:17.670
was relax with my dad,

02:17.704 --> 02:19.171
not think about work,

03:13.693 --> 03:16.562

03:16.596 --> 03:18.639

It's getting warmer out,

03:25.504 --> 03:27.729

03:27.729 --> 03:28.741
I like a young stud like you.

I get a little nervous

03:31.911 --> 03:33.780

Suzie's always a good time.

Everybody be quiet

I'm getting a real feeling

It's pretty cool to connect

don't you think, Chase?

04:43.983 --> 04:45.784
if I buy it, Nanny,

04:45.819 --> 04:47.620
but if Suzie really wants

04:45.819 --> 04:47.620

04:47.653 --> 04:49.389
she can give me

04:47.653 --> 04:49.389

04:53.992 --> 04:55.928
it doesn't work that way.

Now you pick a number

Now think of the number.

- Between what?

05:06.238 --> 05:07.439
- One to ten.

- That's not very many numbers,

but okay.

that I was special.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.640
- Oh, my gosh.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.342
- Your tan looks good.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.777
Is that spray on?

17:23.809 --> 17:26.460
- Well, you know,

17:23.809 --> 17:26.460
since I don't have time

17:26.460 --> 17:28.615
to go and lay out, yeah.

17:29.415 --> 17:31.785
- You need to stop all this

17:29.415 --> 17:31.785
passive aggressive stuff.

17:31.817 --> 17:32.951
- What are you talking about?

17:33.529 --> 17:35.755
- Savannah, nothing sends

17:33.529 --> 17:35.755
a message more

17:35.788 --> 17:38.258
than you inviting Chase to go

17:35.788 --> 17:38.258
to a fashion event.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.426
- Well, yeah, 'cause I had

17:38.290 --> 17:40.426
an event to go to,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.595
and I knew that you weren't

17:40.460 --> 17:42.595
gonna be able to get through it

17:42.628 --> 17:44.564
without talking about business

17:42.628 --> 17:44.564
or...

17:44.596 --> 17:47.933
<i>[quirky music]</i>

17:47.967 --> 17:50.369
So I would've just preferred

17:47.967 --> 17:50.369
to have brought Chase.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.971
- [sighs]

17:52.720 --> 17:54.740
Savannah, you've got a point,

17:54.740 --> 17:55.508
but you understand

17:55.541 --> 17:57.509
that when you started

17:55.541 --> 17:57.509
this beauty business,

17:57.544 --> 17:59.179
you started with one item.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.140
You are now coming up

17:59.211 --> 18:01.140
on adding...

18:01.140 --> 18:03.249
What are you gonna have?

18:01.140 --> 18:03.249
20 SKUs?

18:03.282 --> 18:05.180
- Yeah, the next four months

18:03.282 --> 18:05.180
are huge.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.354
- Exactly, so, you know,

18:07.386 --> 18:09.489
I'm moving your stuff

18:07.386 --> 18:09.489
down the line

18:09.521 --> 18:11.223
to make sure that

18:09.521 --> 18:11.223
you can keep adding

18:11.257 --> 18:13.660
SKU after SKU after SKU.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.296
- I mean, I do appreciate

18:13.692 --> 18:16.296
all the business advice

18:16.328 --> 18:17.730
and everything

18:16.328 --> 18:17.730
that you've done,

18:17.763 --> 18:20.799
'cause you're really the reason

18:17.763 --> 18:20.799
that I'm at where I'm at,

18:20.834 --> 18:23.435
but I need a balance of Dad

18:23.470 --> 18:24.804
and best friend,

18:24.837 --> 18:26.105
and then, like, business.

18:26.138 --> 18:28.407
We used to have

18:26.138 --> 18:28.407
so much fun together,

18:28.441 --> 18:31.440
but now all we do is talk work.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.378
- I mean, listen,

18:32.412 --> 18:34.681
I understand that sometimes

18:34.713 --> 18:36.615
some people

18:36.648 --> 18:38.351
might think that

18:38.384 --> 18:40.529
I get carried away.

18:40.529 --> 18:42.122
- You most certainly

18:40.529 --> 18:42.122
get carried away.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.579
- Savannah, you know

18:42.154 --> 18:45.579
how proud I am of you,

18:45.910 --> 18:46.358
and I only push you so hard

18:46.393 --> 18:48.427
because I see

18:46.393 --> 18:48.427
so much potential.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.963
- I know, Daddy,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.963
but I miss you.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.231
And let's just face it:

18:52.265 --> 18:54.134
hanging out with Chase

18:52.265 --> 18:54.134
just isn't the same.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.690
- Retweet.

18:56.690 --> 18:58.710
I understand

18:56.690 --> 18:58.710
that I need to create

18:58.710 --> 19:00.173
a more...

19:00.205 --> 19:01.740
even balance

19:01.775 --> 19:03.308
of parent...

19:01.775 --> 19:03.308
- Yes.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.912
- And pushing you to work.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.912
- Yes.

19:06.119 --> 19:08.381
- At the end of the day,

19:06.119 --> 19:08.381
all I can do is try.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.500
You know how I get.

19:10.829 --> 19:11.785
- Yeah,

19:10.829 --> 19:11.785
but if you work too much,

19:11.817 --> 19:13.420
then you just work your way

19:11.817 --> 19:13.420
through life.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.549
- If you wanna live

19:13.452 --> 19:15.549
and eat every day,

19:15.880 --> 19:16.455
you gotta work through life.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.791
- Mm. I've got you.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.794
- No.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.794
- Remember what you said?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.162
You're always gonna pay

19:20.826 --> 19:22.162
for your kids' food.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.863
- I don't know why

19:22.194 --> 19:23.863
I ever said that,

19:23.896 --> 19:25.765
'cause y'all eat a lot.

19:25.798 --> 19:26.799
- [laughs]

19:41.748 --> 19:44.317

19:41.748 --> 19:44.317
Where we going?

19:44.351 --> 19:45.818
- You're going right here.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.355
- We're gonna watch TV.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.355
- Watch TV?

19:48.387 --> 19:50.390
Why would I dress up

19:48.387 --> 19:50.390
to watch TV?

19:50.423 --> 19:52.192
- Well, Nanny,

19:50.423 --> 19:52.192
you look beautiful,

19:52.224 --> 19:53.727
and we've got

19:52.224 --> 19:53.727
something special for you.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.662
- We can't reunite you

19:53.759 --> 19:55.662
with the dead,

19:55.694 --> 19:58.664
but we can reunite you

19:55.694 --> 19:58.664
with some familiar faces.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.401
So we have put a little

19:58.698 --> 20:01.401

some of your casino friends,

some of your

basketball friends.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.823
- Oh, my friends.

Y'all made me so happy!

Chase, losing loved ones

20:35.099 --> 20:37.302
is hard,

20:37.336 --> 20:39.873
and I miss some people so much,

20:39.905 --> 20:41.775
but this week

20:39.905 --> 20:41.775
has made me realize

20:41.807 --> 20:45.144
that I need to cherish the ones

20:41.807 --> 20:45.144
that are still in my life.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.311
- Well, Nanny, you know

20:45.177 --> 20:46.311
that I'm always here

20:46.346 --> 20:48.414
to keep you company.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.648
- Yes, I do,

20:49.682 --> 20:51.785

Come on, boys.
