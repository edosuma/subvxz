- [Crazy Eyes] No! Vee! Vee!

01:11.835 --> 01:13.587
No, Vee. [whimpers]

01:13.670 --> 01:16.380
Vee, Vee! Vee.

Vee! Vee!

- Vee! Vee! Vee!

01:20.635 --> 01:21.720
Shut the fuck up!

01:21.803 --> 01:24.222
Yeah, I've been trying to
get some sleep around here!

01:24.305 --> 01:26.641
- What in the hell is wrong with you?
- [inmate] Trying to sleep.

01:26.725 --> 01:27.767
I'm so tired of this shit.

01:27.851 --> 01:30.645
Vee's in trouble. I gotta tell
her about the dragon that's coming.

01:30.729 --> 01:33.732
It was a dream, crazy
pants. You were dreaming.

01:33.815 --> 01:35.358
- What?
- Sit your ass down.

01:36.610 --> 01:37.819
[sighs heavily]

01:39.821 --> 01:41.141
- Just a dream?
- [Black Cindy] Yes!

01:41.197 --> 01:43.867
Like yesterday and the day before that!

01:43.950 --> 01:45.201
Shit!

02:03.052 --> 02:04.345
[Bell on PA] Rise and shine, ladies.

02:04.428 --> 02:07.181
- Another crappy day in prison.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.711
[inhaling deeply]

02:40.381 --> 02:41.800
It smells like her.

02:42.592 --> 02:45.386
You wouldn't understand
it, you're not a parent.

02:46.345 --> 02:51.100
But the top of your head, right
here... it always smells like you.

02:52.060 --> 02:55.980
From the time you're an infant,
until you're a fucked-up adult.

02:57.857 --> 02:59.358
Luschek is the fuck up.

02:59.442 --> 03:01.653
Bullshit. Luschek wasn't lying.

03:01.736 --> 03:04.238
That baggie was hers. She told me herself.

03:05.782 --> 03:07.992
A junkie and a hoarder.

03:08.076 --> 03:10.286
He is still the reason
that she is down there.

03:10.369 --> 03:12.496
He did not need to name her.

03:12.581 --> 03:15.959
Being angry at him is a waste of time.

03:18.002 --> 03:20.880
Seems more productive than
sniffing an old hairbrush.

03:23.132 --> 03:25.384
Hey, Pennsa-fucky.

03:26.219 --> 03:28.930
Hey, you know that
Pennsatucky's a nickname.

03:29.013 --> 03:30.264
Mmm-hmm.

03:30.348 --> 03:32.934
So, you don't gotta change it. It's
already a name that's not my name.

03:33.017 --> 03:35.729
Yes, but there's always room to riff.

03:35.812 --> 03:37.521
Can I borrow some toothpaste?
My commissary's low.

03:37.606 --> 03:39.190
No, I don't got none.

03:40.149 --> 03:41.610
Big Boobs.

03:41.693 --> 03:42.694
Nice one.

03:43.236 --> 03:44.654
How do you not have any toothpaste?

03:44.738 --> 03:47.490
'Cause I don't need any toothpaste.
These babies are porcelain.

03:47.574 --> 03:48.575
[laughing]

03:48.658 --> 03:52.536
You know, I sure as hell ain't a dentist,
but I don't think that's how it works.

03:52.621 --> 03:55.414
Why? 'Cause you think the Queen
of England's just sittin' around,

03:55.498 --> 03:58.960
ordering her butler or whatever to
clean the fancy china with Colgate?

03:59.043 --> 04:00.670
No, of course not.

04:00.754 --> 04:04.048
Because plates don't get cavities
and neither do these bad boys.

04:05.049 --> 04:09.929
Man... your parents didn't really
even do the bare minimum with you.

04:10.013 --> 04:11.430
Oh.

04:11.514 --> 04:16.394
I see your evangeli-crazy fan
club is still going full swing.

04:16.476 --> 04:19.272
[imitates sermonizing
preacher] "Blood will be shed...

04:19.355 --> 04:21.274
for the murdered babies.

04:21.357 --> 04:25.486
We shall stand together and
rejoice as the transgressors'...

04:25.569 --> 04:28.615
[in normal voice] skin
crackles in the fires of hell."

04:28.698 --> 04:31.034
Jesus fucking Christ, that is terrifying.

04:31.117 --> 04:34.203
When you hear it out
loud, I see your point.

04:34.287 --> 04:38.082
"Reverend Lawlor circulated
your prison ID number.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.376
We hope that you've received
our donation, and that you'll... "

04:40.459 --> 04:41.460
Hold up.

04:41.544 --> 04:42.796
Hmm?

04:42.879 --> 04:45.882
These pulsing forehead
veins... they give you money?

04:45.965 --> 04:48.635
Yeah, they do in my commissary.

04:48.718 --> 04:50.094
Oh, my God!

04:50.178 --> 04:51.554
[Pennsatucky] Hmm?

04:51.638 --> 04:54.348
That is fucking genius.

04:54.432 --> 04:55.850
I don't know.

04:57.727 --> 04:59.688
I've been having some feelings about it.

05:00.438 --> 05:03.024
Did you know I didn't shoot that nurse lady

05:03.107 --> 05:07.028
for any type of holy righteous
thing like they all think?

05:08.362 --> 05:09.613
I, uh...

05:12.283 --> 05:15.619
I got really mad and she hurt
my... She hurt my feelings.

05:15.704 --> 05:17.371
And sometimes...

05:17.455 --> 05:21.375
I get this... I get this really bad temper.

05:22.543 --> 05:23.627
Phew.

05:25.004 --> 05:26.840
[stammers]

05:26.923 --> 05:28.549
You still like me or...

05:28.674 --> 05:32.804
[laughing] Oh, Doggett...
don't you know what this means?

05:32.887 --> 05:36.099
Yeah. I'm going to hell.

05:36.182 --> 05:38.309
No, no.

05:38.392 --> 05:41.187
It means you're the normal one.

05:41.270 --> 05:44.858
I mean, come on... some bitch
insulted you, so you shot her?

05:44.941 --> 05:47.151
Now, to me, that makes a
hell of a lot more sense

05:47.235 --> 05:49.112
than shooting a complete stranger

05:49.195 --> 05:51.280
that you've demonized for your own agenda.

05:51.364 --> 05:54.658
I mean, being too
militant about anything...

05:54.743 --> 05:56.327
never ends well.

05:57.245 --> 05:59.622
Those people, they're the nutbags.

06:01.916 --> 06:03.042
- Yep.
- Yeah?

06:03.126 --> 06:04.377
- Yep.
- Yeah.

06:04.460 --> 06:05.461
I get it.

06:05.544 --> 06:06.629
Yeah!

06:06.712 --> 06:10.424
I need to stop taking nuts
from nutbags. All right.

06:10.508 --> 06:12.426
It's time to right my
wrongs. [clears throat]

06:13.594 --> 06:15.096
[stammers] No, no, no, no.

06:15.179 --> 06:18.767
That's... not what I said.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.774
I don't care what you want.
I'm not fucking wearing it!

06:25.857 --> 06:28.359
Why do you have to be
such a bitch all the time?

06:28.442 --> 06:30.278
Because you're such a good role model.

06:30.361 --> 06:32.030
Do you want the kids to make fun of you?

06:32.113 --> 06:35.074
There's good attention and
there's bad attention, Carrie.

06:35.158 --> 06:36.785
I do not understand why you have to

06:36.868 --> 06:38.828
always make things so
difficult for yourself!

06:38.912 --> 06:41.205
- I swear to God!
- [man] What the hell's going on?

06:41.289 --> 06:43.707
You know, I give up. I give up!

06:44.708 --> 06:46.627
Well, that's... nice.

06:47.378 --> 06:48.671
Are you fucking kidding me?

06:48.754 --> 06:51.632
Enough with the "fuckings."
We get that you're a teenager.

06:51.715 --> 06:54.928
- I look like a thumb in a dress.
- You know how happy it'll make her.

06:55.011 --> 06:56.805
You're aware of how stupid that is, right?

06:56.888 --> 07:00.433
That I have to go out and pretend to
be something I'm not to make her happy?

07:00.516 --> 07:02.268
One day we're asking from you.

07:02.351 --> 07:03.911
I can't go to school like this. I won't.

07:03.978 --> 07:06.940
Well, you don't have a
choice. Here's how it works.

07:07.023 --> 07:10.985
You go, you sit, you smile,
they flash the little bulb.

07:11.069 --> 07:14.655
Mom has a picture of you to show Grandma
that won't make her have another stroke...

07:14.738 --> 07:17.741
and you keep wearing clothes from
the boys' section at JC Penney's

07:17.826 --> 07:19.285
on every other day of the year.

07:19.368 --> 07:21.745
- Everyone's happy.
- Yeah, except me.

07:21.830 --> 07:24.999
Boy, it must be exhausting.
All those raging hormones.

07:25.083 --> 07:29.796
Look, I'll buy you a root beer.
I'll put a bendy straw in it.

07:30.713 --> 07:33.341
Do this for your father who
has to live with your mother.

07:33.925 --> 07:34.968
Please.

07:35.927 --> 07:38.471
Fine. But you're both assholes.

07:38.554 --> 07:41.390
There's my sweet little buttercup!

07:50.441 --> 07:51.567
Library later?

07:53.319 --> 07:54.528
I have a headache.

07:57.365 --> 08:01.160
What are you? A '50s housewife?
We haven't had sex in a week.

08:03.121 --> 08:05.373
Lesbian bed death. It's
a thing. Look it up.

08:05.456 --> 08:07.959
Yeah, I'm familiar with
it, and it's bullshit.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.168
[Piper] Hmm.

08:10.128 --> 08:13.297
Come on, maybe we
can't... hate-fuck anymore,

08:13.381 --> 08:15.716
but we can still love-fuck, right?

08:16.634 --> 08:19.846
- Love-fuck?
- Yeah.

08:19.929 --> 08:22.015
Oh, that's so unappealing,
my nipples inverted.

08:22.098 --> 08:23.516
Come on.

08:24.392 --> 08:27.311
It's the only thing that
feels normal to me right now.

08:27.854 --> 08:29.605
Which should tell you how messed up I am.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.859
Let me feel your normals.

08:32.942 --> 08:34.652
Alex, can we drop this?

08:34.735 --> 08:38.239
God, you're acting so pissy.
It's making me kind of hot.

08:38.322 --> 08:41.491
Not today, okay? Stop.

08:42.326 --> 08:43.410
Is this about Nicky?

08:44.871 --> 08:45.997
I miss her, too.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.165
But she, of all people,

08:47.248 --> 08:49.083
would want us getting off in her honor.

08:49.167 --> 08:51.669
[scoffs] You're the worst.

08:54.088 --> 08:55.464
Oh, shit.

08:57.258 --> 08:59.802
It's June 7th. [laughs]

09:00.469 --> 09:03.847
- Oh, my God.
- Can you not tell anyone, please?

09:05.391 --> 09:07.851
[whispers] Because you know
how I feel about June 7ths.

09:07.936 --> 09:09.520
Okay.

09:10.604 --> 09:14.317
Your wish is my command, princess.
Oh, that'd be a fun role-play.

09:15.068 --> 09:16.277
Genie and Aladdin.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.530
"Free me from this lamp, street urchin!"

09:19.613 --> 09:22.075
No? All right, we'll work up to it.

09:24.077 --> 09:26.329
[Caputo] Good, good, good, good.

09:26.412 --> 09:28.789
Hope you're enjoying the provisions, folks.

09:28.872 --> 09:32.210
We're gonna need you to put your
best caffeinated foot forward today.

09:32.293 --> 09:34.128
- Where's the cream?
- No cream.

09:34.212 --> 09:35.546
2%, you want that?

09:35.629 --> 09:37.173
Fig always bought cream.

09:37.256 --> 09:39.050
[Caputo sighs] Let's go. Sit down.

09:39.133 --> 09:41.135
How long is this gonna take?

09:41.219 --> 09:44.430
Remember a week ago, when you were
all crying about losing your jobs?

09:44.513 --> 09:47.225
Remember how horrible
that was gonna be? Hmm?

09:47.308 --> 09:50.728
Well, good old Joe here might have
found a solution to the problem.

09:50.811 --> 09:52.646
Now it's your turn to help yourselves.

09:52.730 --> 09:53.856
Yes?

09:53.940 --> 09:56.067
Did you just refer to
yourself in the third person?

09:56.150 --> 09:58.861
[Caputo sighs deeply] [Bell]
I don't trust these people.

09:58.945 --> 10:01.572
Who buys property without
any comps in the neighborhood?

10:01.655 --> 10:02.991
Can't be a good investment.

10:03.074 --> 10:07.161
They're not buying it... all right?
Litchfield will remain a federal property.

10:07.245 --> 10:10.039
MCC would manage it and retain any profits.

10:10.123 --> 10:11.540
Look, guys, it's a long shot.

10:11.624 --> 10:13.784
They're considering several
facilities at the moment...

10:13.792 --> 10:18.006
but I convinced them... that we
were worth being on that list.

10:18.089 --> 10:19.548
[Donaldson] So, you lied to them.

10:19.632 --> 10:20.674
[all chuckling]

10:21.425 --> 10:23.719
I merely let them know
that we're a good bet.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.721
Sounds like lying.

10:25.804 --> 10:27.473
[both laughing]

10:28.849 --> 10:31.102
There are many misconceptions...

10:31.894 --> 10:36.190
about the costs and difficulty
associated with female prisons,

10:36.274 --> 10:39.318
which I will clear up for
them on the tour today.

10:39.402 --> 10:42.280
These poochies be
difficult. For real, though.

10:42.363 --> 10:43.443
[O'Neill stifling laughter]

10:43.447 --> 10:46.075
[Caputo sighing] Look, help me out.

10:46.159 --> 10:48.244
Don't be stupid.

10:48.327 --> 10:50.079
I've already prepped a few inmates.

10:50.163 --> 10:52.248
If you see something
these people shouldn't see,

10:52.331 --> 10:54.292
solve the problem quickly and quietly.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.878
Managing this place for the Feds?
I don't like the smell of that.

10:57.961 --> 11:00.256
How does unemployment smell? [sniffs] Good?

11:00.339 --> 11:02.966
Smells good to you?

11:07.180 --> 11:10.891
Yo, you kept me up all night... and
now I gotta eat with your ass, too?

11:10.974 --> 11:13.227
Man, don't say "eat" and
"ass" so close together

11:13.311 --> 11:14.728
while I'm trying to eat breakfast.

11:14.812 --> 11:16.814
Somebody woke up on the
wrong side of the bed.

11:16.897 --> 11:18.941
Technically, there's
only one side of the bed

11:19.024 --> 11:20.901
because the other side is
up against the partition,

11:20.984 --> 11:21.985
which wouldn't allow...

11:22.070 --> 11:24.738
- Will you shut the hell up?
- Shit, it's too early for this.

11:24.822 --> 11:26.657
You know what? Somebody wanna explain to me

11:26.740 --> 11:28.117
why she's sitting with us, anyway?

11:28.201 --> 11:30.369
I mean, since when did we start
chilling with bitch-ass followers

11:30.453 --> 11:33.956
who beat the shit out of people just
'cause some crazy lunatic says to?

11:34.707 --> 11:37.626
Sound like some vengeful Simon
Says bullshit, if you ask me.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.378
I was just clarifying the bed issue.

11:39.462 --> 11:41.255
Clarity is important.

11:41.339 --> 11:44.342
"You should be meticulous with your words."

11:44.425 --> 11:46.385
[scoffs] That's what Vee would say.

11:46.469 --> 11:49.472
[chuckles] Except she don't say shit now...

11:50.389 --> 11:53.058
'cause everybody be saying,
"That bitch got smushed

11:53.142 --> 11:54.518
like a bug on a windshield."

11:54.602 --> 11:56.042
- [Black Cindy] Here we go.
- No. No.

11:56.104 --> 11:59.898
You're a liar. She's fine! Vee is fine!

11:59.982 --> 12:02.067
She's coming back for me!

12:02.151 --> 12:04.445
Hey, hey, hey. Take care of your girl.

12:04.528 --> 12:06.029
I ain't her keeper.

12:06.114 --> 12:07.740
It's you or the SHU.

12:07.823 --> 12:09.908
- You wanna be responsible for that?
- Really?

12:09.992 --> 12:11.327
[Poussey clicks tongue]

12:12.828 --> 12:13.871
[tray clatters]

12:13.954 --> 12:16.540
Suzanne, sit down.

12:19.793 --> 12:21.003
P...

12:22.045 --> 12:24.340
switch seats and don't talk to her!

12:24.423 --> 12:26.342
You wanna carry that grudge, be my guest,

12:26.425 --> 12:29.512
but I don't see how them scrawny
chicken legs can stand the extra weight.

12:29.595 --> 12:30.763
[Black Cindy chuckles]

12:32.848 --> 12:36.185
My legs ain't scrawny...
they're proportional.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.658
Hey, hey.

12:50.741 --> 12:54.287
- Nicky will be okay.
- [weakly] How do you know?

12:55.037 --> 12:58.582
I don't. I just... It's
a thing people say, right?

12:58.666 --> 13:00.083
[Lorna sobs]

13:00.168 --> 13:01.877
I'll get your tray.

13:04.922 --> 13:06.674
[Dayanara sighs heavily]

13:06.757 --> 13:08.842
Yo, careful, you're gonna splatter.

13:10.261 --> 13:13.264
That mother... fucker.

13:16.016 --> 13:18.727
- Bennett fucked Aleida?
- No, you idiot.

13:18.811 --> 13:20.521
Oh, like that's such a crazy question.

13:20.604 --> 13:23.023
[exclaims] These eggs smell like ass.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.693
Gloria must have used that fart seasoning.

13:25.776 --> 13:26.777
[both laughing]

13:26.860 --> 13:28.153
[Maritza speaking Spanish]

13:28.237 --> 13:31.199
Yo, you're fucking children,
yo. I can't deal with it today.

13:35.994 --> 13:37.955
[sobbing softly]

13:45.838 --> 13:47.047
[sighs]

13:48.799 --> 13:52.761
"If a man also lie with
mankind, as he lieth... "

13:52.845 --> 13:54.179
Really, "lieth"?

13:54.263 --> 13:55.931
You can't say that word without a lisp.

13:56.014 --> 13:57.725
Who are these people kidding?
God was the original fag.

13:57.808 --> 14:02.062
Look... I happen to think this church
of hers isn't deserving of the title,

14:02.145 --> 14:04.607
and we have a deal... but don't push me.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.942
You're right, Sister.
My bad. [clears throat]

14:07.025 --> 14:09.278
"As he lieth with woman, they are
both committing an abomination,

14:09.362 --> 14:12.448
they shall surely be put to death,
their blood will be upon them." Boom.

14:12.531 --> 14:15.576
- And?
- Leviticus, 24601.

14:16.785 --> 14:19.497
23:13, 20.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.750
- Not Jean Val-jean’s prison number.
- Good catch.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.836
- Thou shalt not make musical references.
- Why not?

14:25.919 --> 14:29.298
Because that's, like, the gayest thing
on the planet and even I know that.

14:29.382 --> 14:33.636
That is an ugly
stereotype... about gay men.

14:33.719 --> 14:36.555
See, everybody knows my people
are stage managers, not performers.

14:36.639 --> 14:38.891
Oh, remember to talk
about the light... a lot.

14:38.974 --> 14:41.269
Walking into the light.
Following the light.

14:41.352 --> 14:43.229
That's good. Yep. Remember that, Boo.

14:43.312 --> 14:45.898
[Sister Ingalls] Are you
sure you're prepared for this?

14:45.981 --> 14:49.568
Eastberg Baptist is all hate, all the time.

14:50.778 --> 14:53.864
Jesus' girlfriend's got a real good point.

14:53.947 --> 14:56.116
'Cause licking gravy boats has
kind of been your whole thing.

14:56.199 --> 14:59.495
And Reverend Lawlor, he's
got a lot of opinions.

14:59.578 --> 15:02.164
Okay, look. Nobody is talking about

15:02.248 --> 15:05.083
conceding my hard-earned
position as Lord of the Lesbians.

15:05.167 --> 15:08.921
I'm just... embracing the
gray areas to make a buck.

15:09.004 --> 15:12.132
Black and white, that's for
zebras and Michael Jackson.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.802
- Wait, ain't he dead?
- Exactly.

15:16.178 --> 15:17.263
Here you go, Sister.

15:17.346 --> 15:21.434
- In lieu of a mattress.
- Oh. Pleasure doing business with you.

15:22.059 --> 15:23.769
And finally,

15:23.852 --> 15:27.315
what led you to see how far you strayed
from the Christian life, Miss Black?

15:27.398 --> 15:28.399
Oh.

15:28.482 --> 15:32.235
Well... [sighs] I hadn't
found the right man, of course.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.740
But then... this chubby Santa
Claus-looking guard showed up,

15:36.824 --> 15:38.284
and boom!

15:38.367 --> 15:39.618
One look at his meaty ass

15:39.702 --> 15:42.330
and I was sticky in the knickers
for monogamous hetero love.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.540
[imitates retching]

15:44.623 --> 15:46.375
[laughing]

15:47.543 --> 15:50.879
- [hip-hop music
playing] - [woman] Whoo!

15:52.673 --> 15:53.924
[Big Boo] Hey, girl.

16:06.937 --> 16:08.356
- [bartender] You okay?
- Yeah.

16:13.861 --> 16:14.862
How's it look?

16:14.945 --> 16:18.616
Oh, clear skies with 100%
chance of pussy after midnight.

16:18.699 --> 16:22.035
- I'm talking about the Browns game.
- Oh! Five point spread. Steelers.

16:22.119 --> 16:23.537
Fuckers! All right.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.541
I'll take... our boys...

16:27.625 --> 16:28.876
- Yeah.
- ATS.

16:30.127 --> 16:31.545
Good luck.

16:31.629 --> 16:32.630
Ha!

16:32.713 --> 16:34.840
Hey, Marcus.

16:34.923 --> 16:37.926
Tell your boy over there
he owes me 200 by Monday.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.011
Cut him some slack.

16:39.094 --> 16:41.555
That is not the business
that I'm in, my brother.

16:44.057 --> 16:45.726
[Big Boo exclaims]

16:46.602 --> 16:47.978
[Marcus] Oh, I know this one.

16:54.192 --> 16:57.530
- Well, hello there.
- Hi.

16:57.613 --> 16:58.656
Rum and Coke, right?

17:00.157 --> 17:01.784
I'm very intuitive.

17:02.910 --> 17:04.953
- It's my favorite.
- Yeah?

17:05.037 --> 17:07.873
Tastes like vacation in a cup.

17:09.124 --> 17:10.584
[stammers]

17:10.667 --> 17:13.211
That was the stupidest
thing I've ever said.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.593
- Uh, my name's Carrie.
- Tracy.

17:19.676 --> 17:23.806
Tracy? Well... it is nice to meet you.

17:23.888 --> 17:25.265
[Big Boo laughing]

17:27.017 --> 17:29.728
I'm having such a good time with you.

17:29.812 --> 17:32.481
- No, it's... It's okay, isn't it?
- [Tracy laughs]

17:32.565 --> 17:34.400
Oh, oh. [gasps]

17:34.483 --> 17:36.068
Look where you are.

17:41.323 --> 17:42.533
I live really close to here.

17:42.616 --> 17:45.703
Do you wanna go there
and... have another drink?

17:46.829 --> 17:50.916
- Yeah, let's do that.
- [chuckles] Let's do that.

17:50.999 --> 17:52.209
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:52.292 --> 17:53.711
Fucking dykes.

17:53.794 --> 17:55.212
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:55.295 --> 17:57.715
You think you're a tough
guy, you cocktail wiener?

17:57.798 --> 17:59.467
Answer me, you fuckwad!

17:59.550 --> 18:02.010
I should fucking kill
you, you fucking asshole!

18:02.094 --> 18:04.012
I'll stuff your little
cock down your throat!

18:04.096 --> 18:05.514
Get out of here!

18:05.598 --> 18:07.182
Get the fuck out of here!

18:07.265 --> 18:10.728
That's right. Run, you
homophobic little bitch!

18:10.811 --> 18:11.812
Um...

18:12.771 --> 18:14.147
I'm going home.

18:15.232 --> 18:18.276
What? Don't let that
little shit ruin our night.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.821
You ruined our night.

18:21.447 --> 18:22.490
Seriously?

18:22.573 --> 18:24.450
You can't blame a stupid kid

18:24.533 --> 18:27.745
when you're the poster
child for all things butch!

18:29.121 --> 18:31.499
You were so hot before you were a cunt.

18:31.582 --> 18:34.668
What the fuck happened to
you to make you so angry?

18:34.752 --> 18:38.756
Oh, I wish I had some sob story
that would explain everything.

18:38.839 --> 18:43.677
Well, sorry to disappoint you, sugar.
Ain't no dramatic origin story here.

18:43.761 --> 18:46.597
Just a big old dyke who
refuses to apologize for it.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.809
You know, c'est moi... you prissy,
homophobic, self-hating bitch.

18:53.979 --> 18:56.314
It was really great meeting you.

19:03.405 --> 19:04.406
[groans]

19:05.407 --> 19:06.534
Fuck.

19:06.617 --> 19:08.410
Thank you so much for coming. Joe Caputo.

19:08.494 --> 19:11.997
Hi, Joe. We spoke on the phone.
Elizabeth Wilkinson, SVP of Acquisitions.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.541
Yes, hi.

19:13.624 --> 19:16.585
- Jack. SVP of Strategic Planning.
- Jack.

19:16.669 --> 19:19.630
- Robert. SVP of Development.
- Robert.

19:19.713 --> 19:21.965
Well, thank you so much
for hearing us out today.

19:22.049 --> 19:26.720
I think you will find that Litchfield
will make a great addition to your company.

19:26.804 --> 19:28.597
Not according to our cost analysis.

19:28.681 --> 19:29.723
[chuckles]

19:30.641 --> 19:31.850
Hey there.

19:31.934 --> 19:33.018
- Joe Caputo.
- Oh.

19:33.101 --> 19:35.228
Hey. Danny Pearson. Good to meet you.

19:35.312 --> 19:37.648
Hey, I remember those days.
Don't let them get you down.

19:37.731 --> 19:39.650
Oh, yeah. This is...

19:39.733 --> 19:41.944
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure thing.

19:43.028 --> 19:44.655
Am I dressed appropriately?

19:44.738 --> 19:46.949
I'm new and the e-mail said no khaki,

19:47.032 --> 19:49.993
and then I wasn't sure
whether to go dressy or casual.

19:50.077 --> 19:52.663
And the more I thought about
it, slacks just seemed...

19:52.746 --> 19:55.165
I don't know. You ever worry about

19:55.248 --> 19:57.626
throwing your freedom
of choice in their faces

19:57.710 --> 20:00.796
like you're showing off to the... women?

20:01.504 --> 20:02.881
We prefer to call them "inmates."

20:02.965 --> 20:07.010
- And you look just fine, Danny.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

20:07.094 --> 20:08.554
Let's get started, huh?

20:08.637 --> 20:11.557
I mean, you would have died.
Second row. Can you even...

20:11.640 --> 20:15.393
I could basically smell
Trey Anastasio's BO.

20:15.477 --> 20:17.479
Oh, and Brittani with an "I," not a "Y... "

20:17.563 --> 20:20.733
she totally smuggled in, like, an
eighth of that strawberry Kush hybrid

20:20.816 --> 20:23.777
that Feinberg's been growing. [exclaims]

20:23.861 --> 20:26.404
It was such a killer night.

20:27.781 --> 20:29.532
Anyway, I miss you.

20:31.785 --> 20:33.954
[sarcastically] That's so fun, Meadow.

20:35.748 --> 20:37.290
[laughs awkwardly] Are you okay?

20:37.374 --> 20:38.667
Mmm...

20:39.668 --> 20:40.961
No.

20:41.044 --> 20:42.588
Everyone's been talking about you.

20:42.671 --> 20:45.423
You know, how badass it is
that you're actually here.

20:45.507 --> 20:48.260
How the rest of us, we wouldn't
be able to survive in prison.

20:48.343 --> 20:52.097
But look at you. You're
doing it. It is so cool.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.223
Oh.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.184
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:57.269 --> 21:00.731
Your vibe's different.
Are you sure you're okay?

21:00.814 --> 21:04.109
If this is about the Pema Chödrön
fight we had right before you left,

21:04.192 --> 21:07.821
- it's really not a big deal...
- Prison is not cool.

21:10.157 --> 21:12.660
Being here is not cool.

21:14.119 --> 21:19.792
It's not brave or admirable or courageous.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.334
It's stupid.

21:21.418 --> 21:22.419
[scoffs]

21:23.295 --> 21:26.006
I feel stupid for being in here...

21:27.883 --> 21:31.845
and stupid for thinking
that it wouldn't ruin my life

21:31.929 --> 21:33.681
and that it would be okay.

21:33.764 --> 21:36.058
And I'm not surviving.

21:36.141 --> 21:39.561
I'm just... existing.

21:40.938 --> 21:46.151
You know, I drove, like,
three hours to get here, right?

21:47.695 --> 21:51.657
Well... you don't have to ever again.

21:55.994 --> 21:58.554
_

21:59.247 --> 22:04.002
Benito Mendoza... look at me. Right now.

22:08.131 --> 22:11.134
_

22:11.218 --> 22:13.971
Talking about him like he's
not at the table won't help.

22:14.054 --> 22:16.556
You want to raise your
own kids? Go right ahead.

22:16.639 --> 22:17.975
I'm sorry.

22:18.058 --> 22:21.269
You know how thankful I am for you.

22:23.230 --> 22:24.231
Gloria.

22:24.314 --> 22:26.316
He's impossible.

22:27.192 --> 22:28.902
And he's so strong now.

22:28.986 --> 22:31.529
The bigger he gets, the
more out of control I feel.

22:32.197 --> 22:34.407
He kicks, he yells.

22:34.491 --> 22:36.284
Last week, he slammed the door so hard,

22:36.368 --> 22:38.912
the plaster split from one
side of the door to the other.

22:38.996 --> 22:40.705
[snickering]

22:41.581 --> 22:43.381
[speaking English] Oh,
you think that's funny?

22:44.793 --> 22:46.086
You listen to me.

22:47.170 --> 22:48.756
You think you hot shit?

22:48.839 --> 22:50.048
You think because I messed up,

22:50.132 --> 22:51.466
you're gonna follow in
your mother's footsteps?

22:51.549 --> 22:53.761
Well, let me tell you
something, you're dead wrong.

22:53.844 --> 22:56.179
From now on, you're gonna come here.

22:56.263 --> 22:59.141
Every week, you're gonna
bring your homework.

22:59.224 --> 23:03.603
And if you don't, I will make
your life a living hell...

23:03.686 --> 23:04.980
even from in here.

23:05.063 --> 23:06.689
Try me.

23:06.774 --> 23:09.109
I'll call my brothers
from Washington Heights...

23:09.192 --> 23:11.361
and they will hang your
ass over that bridge...

23:11.444 --> 23:15.240
until you piss on yourself and it comes
running down your body into your mouth.

23:16.741 --> 23:18.994
That's the kind of shit they live for.

23:21.246 --> 23:22.956
Every week, Benito.

23:24.792 --> 23:27.752
You hear me, little boy? Every week.

23:32.461 --> 23:35.778
_

23:35.803 --> 23:37.930
_

23:38.013 --> 23:39.222
[scoffs]

23:47.856 --> 23:50.358
[Healy] Here... let me get that.

23:50.442 --> 23:53.611
- Here.
- [Red] Oh, you didn't have to do that.

23:53.695 --> 23:57.365
Well, you didn't have to say all those
nice things about me to Katya, either.

23:57.449 --> 23:59.576
[Red] Your Russian really must be terrible.

24:00.869 --> 24:04.289
- You called me a good man.
- I only said what I believed.

24:07.792 --> 24:08.961
Are you all right?

24:10.378 --> 24:12.339
Your eyes look glassy.

24:13.798 --> 24:16.426
I feel like I lost a child.

24:18.761 --> 24:19.972
I'm sorry, Galina.

24:25.018 --> 24:27.645
I thought I could save her.

24:27.729 --> 24:28.730
[sighs]

24:29.689 --> 24:33.693
If someone jumps into
shark-infested waters...

24:33.776 --> 24:35.778
you can't jump in after them.

24:52.212 --> 24:53.296
[Caputo] Cafeteria.

24:53.380 --> 24:56.091
[Crazy Eyes] I know. I told
them that she's doing fine,

24:56.174 --> 24:58.760
that she's sitting under... She's
sitting under a tree somewhere,

24:58.843 --> 25:01.179
eating a Pink Lady apple. Oh! Oh.

25:01.263 --> 25:02.847
'Cause Vee loves Pink Lady apples.

25:02.931 --> 25:07.185
And she's thinking about me...
just like I'm thinking about her.

25:08.896 --> 25:09.938
It's gonna work out.

25:10.605 --> 25:12.399
How much are you spending on meals?

25:12.482 --> 25:17.487
$1.79 per inmate per meal. $5.37 a day.

25:18.780 --> 25:23.118
We find that women eat less than men,
so we're able to keep our food costs low.

25:23.201 --> 25:25.745
The national average is $1.58.

25:25.828 --> 25:30.500
We've heard some discouraging things
about housing a female population.

25:30.583 --> 25:35.047
Do you find it's more difficult
because of their health requirements?

25:36.089 --> 25:37.590
[sniffling]

25:37.674 --> 25:41.803
You know, the great thing is,
the ladies here are all synced up.

25:41.886 --> 25:44.389
So... it's a real rough couple of days,

25:44.472 --> 25:47.309
but at least it's not spread out, you know?

25:47.392 --> 25:49.561
I grew up with three sisters
and a mother in the house,

25:49.644 --> 25:52.439
so, we had to batten down the hatches.

25:52.522 --> 25:54.024
Lucky I made it out of there alive.

25:57.402 --> 25:58.778
Let's move on to the kitchen.

26:00.863 --> 26:04.617
Inmate Mendoza, glad you can
join us. What's on the menu today?

26:05.493 --> 26:06.744
Food.

26:06.828 --> 26:09.456
It's a Cuban garbanzo
bean stew-type thingy.

26:09.539 --> 26:12.500
We got a whole case of
it last week, and Gloria,

26:12.584 --> 26:16.504
she figured out a way how to stretch them
after we picked out all the rotten ones.

26:19.049 --> 26:22.885
[Caputo] We find that our inmates
are one of our best assets.

26:22.970 --> 26:24.262
They are very resourceful,

26:24.346 --> 26:27.515
and we rely on them to
help us get through the day.

26:27.599 --> 26:30.560
Yeah, like this one time,
everyone got the shits real bad

26:30.643 --> 26:32.020
from eating old pork or whatever,

26:32.104 --> 26:34.189
so we served white bread
for the next couple of days.

26:34.272 --> 26:37.317
It was real good for the tummy.
It sopped up all the badness.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.696
Hey, Joe, are you guys on the
codified national meal schedule?

26:41.779 --> 26:45.200
You know, I'm... I'm not sure about...

26:46.368 --> 26:48.786
- I'm gonna look into that, Danny.
- Great, take your time.

26:48.870 --> 26:52.415
Yeah, let's keep moving,
huh? Right this way.

26:55.043 --> 26:57.420
When are you two gonna
learn how to shut up?

26:57.504 --> 27:00.590
You're like Lucy and
Ethel without the charm.

27:00.673 --> 27:03.301
- We was just trying to help.
- You wanna help?

27:03.385 --> 27:06.638
Start by shutting up and
doing what I ask you to do.

27:06.721 --> 27:09.432
Stop gabbing while you're serving.

27:09.516 --> 27:13.853
Stop thinking that anyone needs
you to do more than your job.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.313
Jeez.

27:17.065 --> 27:18.608
- You got your period?
- Yes.

27:18.691 --> 27:19.734
Me, too.

27:19.817 --> 27:22.237
[gasps] Oh. It all makes sense now.

27:23.488 --> 27:24.648
If you follow the power cord,

27:24.697 --> 27:25.907
- it'll lead you...
- I know.

27:25.990 --> 27:28.285
I'm just saying, it'll
lead you to the fuse.

27:28.368 --> 27:30.120
I don't need your help...

27:30.203 --> 27:33.623
- you disgusting little vole.
- [scoffs]

27:34.457 --> 27:37.335
Don't you talk to me. Don't you look at me.

27:37.419 --> 27:41.005
And go ahead... give me a
shot for being insubordinate.

27:41.089 --> 27:42.549
I don't give a fuck.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.009
[scoffs]

27:46.053 --> 27:49.222
Am I at least allowed
to ask what a vole is?

27:49.306 --> 27:50.473
[Caputo] Right this way.

27:52.434 --> 27:54.311
Chapman, how are we doing today?

27:54.977 --> 27:57.980
We are doing so great, Mr. Caputo.

27:58.065 --> 27:59.982
Would you mind explaining

28:00.067 --> 28:02.444
what it is you're doing
today, for our guests?

28:02.527 --> 28:03.903
Absolutely.

28:03.986 --> 28:07.990
The microwave... it
stopped working yesterday,

28:08.075 --> 28:10.618
so I'm trying to fix it.

28:12.454 --> 28:14.122
By assigning our inmates work duty,

28:14.206 --> 28:18.376
we avoid the exorbitant cost
of hiring outside contractors.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.587
Everybody contributes to the community.

28:20.670 --> 28:23.005
Well, not everyone.

28:23.090 --> 28:25.633
Some people try to... destroy it.

28:26.593 --> 28:28.428
What seems to be the problem there?

28:28.511 --> 28:31.931
The... thermal fuse blew.

28:32.682 --> 28:34.434
And you can fix that by yourself, honey?

28:36.228 --> 28:38.313
Well, I sure can...

28:38.396 --> 28:41.774
if I concentrate extra
hard with my lady brain.

28:41.858 --> 28:43.110
[Wilkinson snickers]

28:43.193 --> 28:44.277
Thank you, Chapman.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.779
Right this way.

28:50.658 --> 28:55.080
We're gonna make you look
real natural. Don't worry.

28:56.289 --> 28:57.332
[Sophia] Mmm.

28:57.415 --> 29:01.919
Go ahead and call me Jesus from now on,
'cause this bitch just worked a miracle.

29:02.003 --> 29:03.671
It really is something.

29:03.755 --> 29:05.298
Yeah, it's definitely something.

29:05.382 --> 29:09.051
[Big Boo chuckling] Man, I cannot
wait to fleece this motherfucker.

29:09.136 --> 29:11.596
I'm actually, like, all tingly and shit.

29:11.679 --> 29:15.517
Okay. All finished.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.186
- [Big Boo] Show me my big, beautiful self!
- Okay, almost there.

29:18.270 --> 29:19.812
- Just hold on, all right?
- [Big Boo] All right.

29:19.896 --> 29:23.441
- There... we... go.
- [Big Boo] Uh-huh.

29:23.525 --> 29:25.152
Oh, I love this part!

29:25.235 --> 29:27.028
This is like that TV show

29:27.112 --> 29:30.698
where they gave those ladies
the plastic surgery makeover

29:30.782 --> 29:33.910
and then all their problems
just went away after.

29:34.744 --> 29:36.579
Okay, here we go.

29:38.206 --> 29:40.750
[Lorna shrieking] Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

29:40.833 --> 29:43.795
I just love makeovers
and you look so pretty.

29:43.878 --> 29:46.464
Boo, you look fucking weird.

29:47.507 --> 29:48.550
What? She does.

29:49.676 --> 29:50.885
No, um...

29:54.055 --> 29:55.890
I look like my mother.

30:02.104 --> 30:05.400
[woman moaning] Carrie! Oh! Oh, God!

30:10.738 --> 30:12.490
[both moaning]

30:12.574 --> 30:13.575
[woman] Oh, my God!

30:13.658 --> 30:15.202
[both groaning]

30:15.285 --> 30:16.453
[both laughing]

30:20.873 --> 30:23.793
Fuck, I love you.

30:24.669 --> 30:26.504
Says the girl who just came.

30:27.464 --> 30:30.800
I don't see why that's not a
perfectly valid reason to love someone.

30:30.883 --> 30:32.177
Well...

30:32.260 --> 30:33.470
[sighs]

30:35.012 --> 30:36.764
And do you know why I love you?

30:37.724 --> 30:40.393
- Because I have great tits?
- Exactly.

30:40.477 --> 30:42.270
[both laughing]

30:44.939 --> 30:47.650
Jesus, don't get me going again, girl.

30:48.693 --> 30:50.027
[Big Boo chuckles]

30:55.074 --> 30:56.701
Can I ask you something?

30:57.910 --> 30:59.746
Not if it's about my mother.

30:59.829 --> 31:01.498
Carrie, come on.

31:03.583 --> 31:04.834
Talk to me.

31:10.215 --> 31:13.510
Remember when we were
fucking? Gee, that was fun.

31:15.220 --> 31:18.473
Your mom is sick and you're not
gonna go see her? That's not normal.

31:18.556 --> 31:21.100
You're right, I'm not normal. I'm queer.

31:21.183 --> 31:24.854
[gasps] Wait, did you
not know we were lesbos?

31:24.937 --> 31:26.231
My bad, I should have told you.

31:26.314 --> 31:27.732
You must have been very confused.

31:28.650 --> 31:30.777
Look, I don't get why
you're holding on to this.

31:31.486 --> 31:34.196
Look at you, you're living
your life, you have me.

31:34.281 --> 31:36.574
You don't have to keep fighting the world.

31:37.825 --> 31:39.744
I mean, isn't forgiving
her easier than not?

31:39.827 --> 31:42.163
Oh, Christ. I don't fucking know.

31:44.916 --> 31:48.461
Look, I'm worried if you don't go
see her, you're gonna regret it.

31:52.131 --> 31:56.010
Those little baskets of seashells
everywhere really freak me out.

31:56.093 --> 31:58.054
- It's weird living back home.
- [Piper] Right.

31:58.137 --> 32:01.140
They said it was going to be
two weeks, and yet it's been six.

32:01.223 --> 32:04.602
The sustainable wood for the
micro-house is on backorder.

32:04.686 --> 32:05.895
Isn't that amazing?

32:05.978 --> 32:09.857
Who would have thought that wood
could be on backorder? [laughs]

32:10.650 --> 32:12.819
Are they waiting for the
trees to grow? [laughs]

32:12.902 --> 32:15.780
Are you waiting for the oceans
to rise and reclaim their bounty?

32:15.863 --> 32:17.449
[Piper laughing] Oh.

32:17.532 --> 32:19.617
Isn't this fun?

32:19.701 --> 32:20.993
What's with your new look?

32:21.077 --> 32:24.331
Did you join a World
War II reenactment group?

32:24.414 --> 32:25.665
Well, that's dark.

32:25.748 --> 32:28.042
Cal's gotten into the
postmodern ice-cream movement.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.252
Been doing some really interesting
experiments with nitrogen.

32:30.337 --> 32:33.340
I'm working on a BLT flavor at this moment.

32:33.423 --> 32:34.924
And, when we get enough money,

32:35.007 --> 32:37.302
we're gonna open an
old-fashioned ice cream parlor

32:37.385 --> 32:41.389
but with future-now flavors
for an experiential mash-up.

32:41.473 --> 32:42.890
So I decided to, you know,

32:42.974 --> 32:45.101
- perfect my look,
now. - Mmm-hmm.

32:45.184 --> 32:48.730
I'm bidding online for a
wearable bass drum as we speak.

32:48.813 --> 32:50.482
- It's all happening.
- [chuckling]

32:51.733 --> 32:52.942
[Carol] Enough about us.

32:53.025 --> 32:54.611
How's your birthday, darling?

32:54.694 --> 32:57.697
Did you get any presents
from your prison friends?

32:57.780 --> 33:02.076
I haven't told anyone it's my
birthday, so, nope, no presents.

33:05.079 --> 33:07.206
[stammers] Are you not gonna say anything?

33:08.708 --> 33:10.418
I don't have anything to say.

33:10.502 --> 33:11.794
[Bill clears throat]

33:11.878 --> 33:13.463
Then why did you come?

33:16.883 --> 33:18.968
Because it's your birthday, Piper.

33:20.637 --> 33:22.179
Have I ever missed your birthday?

33:26.267 --> 33:29.061
I'm sorry, I can't just sit
here and make small talk.

33:29.145 --> 33:33.566
You don't have to, I'm not size-ist.
You can talk big, you could talk medium?

33:33.650 --> 33:35.192
You're 32.

33:36.152 --> 33:39.447
You're getting further
and further behind in life.

33:39.531 --> 33:40.907
[sighs]

33:40.990 --> 33:43.701
I'm frustrated that we
can't seem to help you.

33:46.203 --> 33:50.041
Maybe this is exactly where
I am supposed to be right now.

33:51.250 --> 33:56.423
Maybe this... right now, is
making me a better person.

33:56.506 --> 33:57.840
[scoffs]

33:57.924 --> 34:01.553
I'm learning... more Spanish...

34:02.804 --> 34:04.263
and I can fix things.

34:06.098 --> 34:10.520
I'm a part of a community...
and I have a girlfriend.

34:13.690 --> 34:16.025
I have a girlfriend that I love.

34:19.235 --> 34:20.321
So, there.

34:21.112 --> 34:22.864
Saw that coming.

34:22.949 --> 34:25.493
So, does that mean you're officially...

34:25.577 --> 34:29.205
It means that I officially...
have a girlfriend.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.333
Dear God.

34:34.085 --> 34:37.045
You know, I find myself
saying that phrase, too, a lot.

34:37.129 --> 34:39.090
But with a different inflection and...

34:39.172 --> 34:40.592
[panting]

34:40.675 --> 34:41.801
breathier.

34:41.884 --> 34:45.513
Dear... [inhales sharply] God!

34:45.597 --> 34:46.598
[gasps]

34:47.556 --> 34:49.434
- [Piper yelping]
- [Cal] Whoa!

34:54.856 --> 34:56.440
Happy birthday!

34:59.986 --> 35:01.946
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

35:03.740 --> 35:04.949
Hi, there.

35:07.577 --> 35:09.579
Need something?

35:09.662 --> 35:13.415
Well, I'm sorry to bother you. I
just... I wanted you to have these.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.252
I thought they might brighten your day.

35:16.335 --> 35:17.587
Rose seeds?

35:18.796 --> 35:21.924
Oh, is that what they are? I
don't have a green thumb, so...

35:22.008 --> 35:24.426
It says "rose" right there on the package.

35:24.511 --> 35:27.972
I was in a hurry after lunch, so...

35:29.974 --> 35:31.976
They'll be a lovely addition to the garden.

35:32.059 --> 35:33.185
Thank you.

35:34.020 --> 35:35.647
You're welcome.

35:49.619 --> 35:52.622
How you gonna love a song that just,
like, lists the days of the week?

35:52.705 --> 35:54.582
Like it's Sesame Street or some shit?

35:54.666 --> 35:56.668
That's only one teeny part.

35:56.751 --> 35:58.920
The rest is all, "Tonight's
gonna be a good night."

35:59.003 --> 36:02.173
It makes me feel optimistic about
the evening we gonna have and shit.

36:02.256 --> 36:03.508
You know we in prison though, right?

36:03.591 --> 36:05.593
Whatever, man, they all sellouts anyway.

36:05.677 --> 36:07.554
Man... [mimics phone ringing]

36:07.637 --> 36:09.847
Hello? One second, please.

36:09.931 --> 36:12.934
Poussey Washington, it's the
Black Eyed Peas calling for you.

36:13.017 --> 36:15.144
They wanna give you all the moneys.

36:15.227 --> 36:18.731
All you got to do is sing the
days of the week and be famous.

36:18.815 --> 36:20.733
- All the moneys?
- All the moneys!

36:20.817 --> 36:22.026
Um...

36:22.109 --> 36:23.402
- No.
- Ooh.

36:23.485 --> 36:26.197
Man, you're bullshitting!
You're bullshitting.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.575
If that's the case, I
could be a famous rapper.

36:28.658 --> 36:30.367
You know what I'm saying, like...

36:30.451 --> 36:32.787
- ♪ January, February, March ♪
- [Poussey] ♪ Oh, what you got? ♪

36:32.870 --> 36:34.872
♪ April, May and June
July, August, September ♪

36:34.956 --> 36:37.542
Shit, yo! I'm gonna turn this shit up.

36:37.625 --> 36:39.586
We all know what it's like to move.

36:39.669 --> 36:41.549
- All the boxes, the schlepping...
- [Poussey] Yo!

36:41.588 --> 36:43.005
Hey, who the fuck is that?

36:43.089 --> 36:46.008
- Yo, it's Judy King, man!
- The chef lady.

36:46.092 --> 36:48.135
Yo, she ain't just a chef, man.

36:48.219 --> 36:50.555
She's an entertainment
and lifestyle specialist.

36:50.638 --> 36:51.973
Yo, she cooks the food,

36:52.056 --> 36:54.559
and then she shows you
how to present it, right?

36:54.642 --> 36:57.061
Putting little sprigs
of rosemary on the plate,

36:57.144 --> 36:59.897
putting it on a bed of
moss and shit. [chuckles]

36:59.981 --> 37:01.566
Presentation is everything.

37:01.649 --> 37:03.192
Did you just say "sprig"?

37:03.275 --> 37:06.988
Raspberry buttermilk pie.
It's my way of saying...

37:07.071 --> 37:08.322
[snoring]

37:08.405 --> 37:09.949
[exclaims]

37:10.032 --> 37:11.158
I've seen this one before.

37:11.242 --> 37:13.828
That raspberry buttermilk
pie turns out real nice.

37:13.911 --> 37:17.331
Even when white folks try to
be exciting, they still boring.

37:17.414 --> 37:19.375
Yeah, I was asleep. [laughs]

37:20.960 --> 37:22.962
Yo, what the fuck? Look.

37:26.382 --> 37:28.217
Man, that girl is gonna be the death of me.

37:28.300 --> 37:30.094
Let her ass go to the SHU.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.014
Right this way.

37:34.974 --> 37:36.517
[Caputo] Sure, yeah.

37:37.977 --> 37:39.353
This is our TV room.

37:39.436 --> 37:40.730
[Poussey] Go, go. You gotta go.

37:44.942 --> 37:46.027
[Crazy Eyes] Ow. Ow.

37:46.110 --> 37:49.113
White people... and other.

37:51.323 --> 37:55.202
And we'll be going... uh, this way.

37:55.286 --> 37:56.746
Right this way.

37:59.999 --> 38:03.585
[exhales] Hey, hands up over your head.

38:03.670 --> 38:05.254
[Crazy Eyes whimpering]

38:10.176 --> 38:11.427
[stammers]

38:11.510 --> 38:14.013
Vee came to me.

38:14.096 --> 38:17.308
And she told me to follow her...

38:17.391 --> 38:20.311
but my feet weren't... fast enough.

38:20.394 --> 38:21.437
[Taystee] Okay.

38:21.520 --> 38:25.316
And I missed her, Taystee. I missed her.

38:25.399 --> 38:28.485
Suzanne... you have to listen to me.

38:34.366 --> 38:37.787
- Vee wasn't here.
- Yes, she...

38:37.870 --> 38:39.080
Vee's dead.

38:39.163 --> 38:41.290
- No, she's not!
- Yes, she is!

38:41.373 --> 38:43.960
- She is not! No, she's not!
- Vee is dead, Suzanne!

38:44.043 --> 38:48.130
Vee is dead! Vee is dead!
Vee is dead! [sobbing]

39:08.985 --> 39:10.361
She's gone.

39:14.531 --> 39:17.869
Yes... she's gone.

39:21.831 --> 39:24.041
I am so sorry.

39:27.294 --> 39:28.963
Me, too.

40:05.707 --> 40:09.211
- Need a little help, there?
- Nope, I've got it. Thank you.

40:15.634 --> 40:17.011
I called you my girlfriend.

40:17.094 --> 40:19.806
What? To who?

40:19.889 --> 40:22.433
To my parents...

40:22.516 --> 40:25.477
and my... brother and my brother's wife.

40:26.687 --> 40:27.855
[exhales]

40:29.023 --> 40:31.859
- That's a bold move, Chapman.
- I know.

40:31.943 --> 40:34.570
I didn't even mean to say it. It just...

40:35.863 --> 40:39.033
It just came out. And now...

40:40.242 --> 40:41.682
Now, I can't stop thinking about it.

40:41.702 --> 40:44.371
Do you want to pass me a note
and have me circle yes or no?

40:44.455 --> 40:46.833
I'm not asking you to be my girlfriend.

40:46.916 --> 40:48.375
- [chuckles] Oh, no?
- No.

40:48.459 --> 40:53.130
Definitely not. I just thought...
I thought that it was weird.

40:54.131 --> 40:55.507
It's totally weird.

40:58.845 --> 41:02.764
You know, the Quran is turning out to be
more interesting than I would've guessed.

41:02.849 --> 41:04.892
Technically, I'm not
supposed to be touching it,

41:04.976 --> 41:06.518
but I did wash my hands.

41:06.602 --> 41:08.645
So, I decided that Allah
would be cool with it.

41:08.729 --> 41:10.147
Will you be my girlfriend?

41:10.231 --> 41:11.398
[laughing]

41:13.109 --> 41:14.610
- Yeah.
- Yes?

41:14.693 --> 41:17.029
Yes, you idiot.

41:17.113 --> 41:18.197
She said "yes."

41:19.198 --> 41:21.325
- Good for you, hon.
- Mazel tov!

41:32.253 --> 41:33.420
I have something for you.

41:34.296 --> 41:36.590
- It's a non-birthday
gift. - Okay.

41:43.555 --> 41:44.556
Here.

41:45.266 --> 41:48.810
What is this? Is this... a list of songs?

41:48.895 --> 41:51.480
Well, I couldn't make you a mix, so...

41:51.563 --> 41:54.066
I wrote down the songs
I would've put on the mix

41:54.150 --> 41:57.069
if we were, like... normal people

41:57.904 --> 42:01.282
and not weird prison girlfriends.

42:03.117 --> 42:04.826
Um...

42:04.911 --> 42:08.414
Okay, Only You, Yaz.

42:08.497 --> 42:11.500
You Wouldn't Like Me, Tegan and Sara.

42:11.583 --> 42:14.586
- The Pussy is Mine, Miguel.
- Miguel.

42:14.670 --> 42:17.214
This is so nice, and so gay.

42:17.298 --> 42:20.176
- I know.
- Thank you.

42:30.019 --> 42:31.812
Mr. Caputo, I need to speak to you.

42:31.896 --> 42:35.524
Uh, I'm sure it's something your counselor
would be happy to assist you with, inmate.

42:35.607 --> 42:37.484
It's about one of your guards.

42:38.527 --> 42:40.779
As you can see, I am
very busy at the moment.

42:40.862 --> 42:43.782
So, I will make every effort
to try and find you tomorrow.

42:44.951 --> 42:46.202
It's about CO Bennett.

42:47.286 --> 42:50.289
[chuckles nervously] Excuse me.

42:50.372 --> 42:51.373
Please.

42:53.167 --> 42:54.876
What the hell do you want?

42:54.961 --> 42:58.839
He hasn't been here for two weeks.
I haven't heard nothing from him.

42:58.923 --> 43:00.967
Please, Mr. Caputo, you
gotta know where he is.

43:01.050 --> 43:02.259
You gotta know something.

43:02.343 --> 43:04.220
I am gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

43:04.303 --> 43:07.848
and assume that you are
not a complete moron,

43:07.932 --> 43:11.143
despite that stupid, stupid
power move you just tried to pull.

43:11.227 --> 43:14.438
Which means you can make the same
assumption I've made about Bennett,

43:14.521 --> 43:15.689
he is gone.

43:15.772 --> 43:17.691
- No.
- And he is not coming back.

43:17.774 --> 43:22.363
Unfortunately for you, inmate, not
everyone around here is locked up.

43:23.530 --> 43:24.781
[Elizabeth] Mr. Caputo...

43:26.492 --> 43:30.079
I hate to be presumptive,
but was that inmate pregnant?

43:30.162 --> 43:33.040
This is a good example of our concerns.

43:33.124 --> 43:36.252
The costs associated with a birth
while the inmate is in our care.

43:36.335 --> 43:38.337
And they're prohibitive, to say the least.

43:38.420 --> 43:41.007
Great thing about men,
they don't have uterus’s.

43:42.424 --> 43:44.468
She's not pregnant.

43:44.551 --> 43:47.179
And quite frankly, you should
never assume that about a woman.

43:47.263 --> 43:49.640
Phew! I've learned that one the hard way.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.187
Well, a big hetero hello to all of you.

43:57.023 --> 44:00.192
You buying this? Anybody? Yes? No?

44:00.276 --> 44:01.777
Thank you.

44:05.822 --> 44:09.160
[man on PA] Code blue in
room 23. Code blue, room 23.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.873
Carrie.

44:15.582 --> 44:17.418
Hey, Pop.

44:17.501 --> 44:18.502
[sighs]

44:19.420 --> 44:21.172
[Big Boo] Hi.

44:23.049 --> 44:24.633
You okay?

44:24.716 --> 44:28.137
[scoffs] Of course, not.
That was stupid, huh?

44:29.221 --> 44:33.225
I can't believe you're here.
It's been so many years, Carrie.

44:33.309 --> 44:37.146
Well, you know... she's my mother.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.898
I'm here now.

44:41.317 --> 44:43.694
You won't even recognize
her, she's so frail.

44:44.986 --> 44:46.822
I can handle it, Pop.

44:47.448 --> 44:49.241
I... I don't think she can.

44:53.745 --> 44:57.124
What, you mean the...
sight of her dyke daughter

44:57.208 --> 44:58.584
is going to make her worse?

44:58.667 --> 45:00.377
Carrie...

45:00.461 --> 45:03.839
would it kill you to put on some
other clothes before you see her?

45:03.922 --> 45:06.675
Well, these are my good Chucks, Pop.

45:06.758 --> 45:08.135
You know what I mean.

45:10.762 --> 45:11.972
Gosh...

45:13.807 --> 45:15.726
I'm so fucking tired.

45:17.186 --> 45:18.520
[sighs heavily]

45:19.896 --> 45:22.941
I have been her daughter for 42 years.

45:23.024 --> 45:24.610
Now...

45:24.693 --> 45:28.155
don't you think she could have
taken some of that time to...

45:28.239 --> 45:33.285
work on accepting me for who
I am, rather than mourning...

45:33.369 --> 45:38.165
every... fucking... thing... that I am not?

45:38.249 --> 45:42.085
I understand that whatever
this is, is important to you,

45:42.169 --> 45:43.962
but it's a costume, that's all.

45:44.045 --> 45:47.883
The rest of us, we get up, put on
a suit and a tie, we go to work.

45:47.966 --> 45:51.345
You think that's how I wanted to dress
five days a week? No, of course not.

45:51.428 --> 45:55.098
But no one gets the privilege of
being themselves all the time, Carrie.

45:55.182 --> 45:56.558
No one.

45:57.934 --> 46:01.480
Now, if you want to go in there and
upset her, I'm not gonna stop you.

46:01.563 --> 46:05.859
But you need to decide whether your
costume is worth what it's costing you.

46:08.404 --> 46:09.571
I...

46:10.906 --> 46:14.368
have had to fight for this...

46:17.120 --> 46:18.289
all my life, Dad.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.499
All my life.

46:21.458 --> 46:26.087
Strangers, girlfriends,
fuck, even my own parents...

46:27.631 --> 46:32.636
all asking me to be
something... that I am not.

46:32.719 --> 46:38.141
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

46:38.225 --> 46:42.813
Like, your whole fucking
existence is being denied, like...

46:42.896 --> 46:46.775
"Whoa, you'd be better off
if you were invisible"? Yeah.

46:51.738 --> 46:55.409
I refuse to be invisible, Daddy.

46:57.369 --> 46:59.830
Not for you, not for Mom...

47:01.957 --> 47:03.459
not for anybody.

47:05.836 --> 47:07.213
[sighs]

47:11.217 --> 47:12.509
So, um...

47:14.845 --> 47:16.430
I'm sorry.

47:32.988 --> 47:34.406
[crying softly]

47:34.490 --> 47:36.325
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

47:46.042 --> 47:48.920
Hi, there. You must be the Reverend Lawlor.

47:49.004 --> 47:50.005
Carrie, it's a pleasure.

47:50.088 --> 47:51.928
I've heard such impressive
things from Tiffany.

47:52.007 --> 47:53.174
- Please.
- Oh, thank you.

47:53.259 --> 47:57.304
Well, she's told me really great
things about your holy work, sir.

47:57.388 --> 48:00.098
So, it sounds like you've
been on quite a journey.

48:00.181 --> 48:02.893
Using your time here to
get back on the right path?

48:02.976 --> 48:05.354
It's a testament to the power
of prison rehabilitation.

48:05.437 --> 48:07.731
Oh, absolutely, yes.

48:07.814 --> 48:11.735
You know, there's... so
much time here to think...

48:12.736 --> 48:17.491
reflect on life... regrets... on sin.

48:17.574 --> 48:19.242
Yeah. Tell me more about that.

48:20.786 --> 48:23.121
Forgive me, I just...

48:23.204 --> 48:25.832
I get so emotional when
I have to talk about this.

48:27.918 --> 48:30.045
You know, like the Bible says...

48:30.128 --> 48:35.133
"If man also lie with mankind
the way he lieth with woman... "

48:35.216 --> 48:37.761
"both have committed an abomination."

48:37.844 --> 48:40.556
- Amen. Exactly.
- You're not alone.

48:40.639 --> 48:43.392
I've talked to so many
people like yourself.

48:43.475 --> 48:45.268
Faggots who have committed disgusting acts

48:45.352 --> 48:48.314
before admitting that they'd
fallen prey to this illness.

48:48.397 --> 48:50.774
I hope you don't mind my asking...

48:50.857 --> 48:52.609
what was it that turned you to the light?

48:52.693 --> 48:56.822
Well, I just, I prayed. A lot.

48:56.905 --> 48:58.824
And then Jesus came in me...

49:00.326 --> 49:04.455
To me, sorry. Jesus came
to me... with so much love.

49:04.538 --> 49:06.289
- Praise the
Lord. - Mmm-hmm.

49:07.499 --> 49:10.210
Reverend, Tiffany said that...

49:10.293 --> 49:13.547
you might be able to take up a collection

49:13.630 --> 49:15.757
to help support me

49:15.841 --> 49:19.678
as I continue my walk
on the path of decency.

49:20.387 --> 49:24.224
Stories like yours really
resonate with the congregation.

49:24.307 --> 49:27.603
The narrative of the reformed
sinner spreading the gospel.

49:27.686 --> 49:31.773
And let me tell you, your story,
a tale of wickedness and depravity,

49:31.857 --> 49:33.274
a thieving dyke.

49:33.359 --> 49:36.653
Well, that should make for a
compelling inspirational pamphlet.

49:36.737 --> 49:37.821
[chuckles]

49:37.904 --> 49:40.949
Of course, we'll need to cover
that tattoo of yours for the photo.

49:45.662 --> 49:46.830
[scoffs]

49:47.914 --> 49:49.916
- Reverend Lawlor?
- Are you all right?

49:50.000 --> 49:54.713
Yes, I'm... just trying
to remember the passage.

49:54.796 --> 49:58.842
Oh, yes... it's Corinthians 69.

49:58.925 --> 50:00.636
I think it goes...

50:00.719 --> 50:04.347
"Suck my big fat dyke dick,

50:04.431 --> 50:08.810
you fucking hateful piece of shit!"

50:08.894 --> 50:10.812
- Fuck you! What?
- All right, settle down.

50:10.896 --> 50:11.980
- That's enough.
- I'm good.

50:12.063 --> 50:15.066
Jesus was a fag. He said,
"This is my body. Eat me."

50:16.109 --> 50:17.903
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you.

50:17.986 --> 50:19.320
I appreciate your time.

50:19.405 --> 50:20.947
- It was very informative.
- Thank you.

50:21.031 --> 50:23.825
- All right, Joe, thanks.
- Thank you.

50:23.909 --> 50:25.577
Drive safe.

50:25.661 --> 50:29.039
Watch yourself on Route
16, huh? Uh, speed trap.

50:35.170 --> 50:36.254
So?

50:38.048 --> 50:41.176
I'd polish up that resume
if I were you, Ford.

50:42.469 --> 50:43.470
[sighs]

50:52.353 --> 50:53.564
[sighs]

51:02.739 --> 51:04.240
Can I have one of those?

51:05.784 --> 51:07.202
Get the fuck out of here.

51:07.285 --> 51:08.286
[scoffs]

51:09.496 --> 51:11.372
What the hell is wrong with all of you?

51:12.749 --> 51:15.752
I swear to God, you were my kid...

51:17.253 --> 51:18.464
[scoffs]

51:20.381 --> 51:23.176
If you were my kid,
you'd still be fucked up.

51:25.637 --> 51:26.805
Please.

51:28.264 --> 51:29.432
I need something.

51:30.767 --> 51:31.768
You okay?

51:42.195 --> 51:43.196
He's gone.

51:45.574 --> 51:46.742
I know.

51:50.411 --> 51:53.749
Fucking piece of shit. Like all of them.

51:54.791 --> 51:56.084
Yep.

51:58.712 --> 52:01.422
Can't believe he just left us.

52:15.186 --> 52:17.480
It's not the worst thing
that'll happen to that kid.

52:36.416 --> 52:38.209
[Pennsatucky] I'm glad you're back.

52:38.293 --> 52:39.795
Seeing you like that was scarier

52:39.878 --> 52:43.840
than seein' that dolphin penis at SeaWorld.

52:43.924 --> 52:46.802
Around all that water, it
looked out of place, you know.

52:46.885 --> 52:48.929
Some ladies just ain't
meant to look lady-like.

52:49.012 --> 52:51.973
Now, my mother would disagree.

52:52.057 --> 52:54.685
She'd say, "Don't be a salmon."

52:55.644 --> 52:56.770
Is that a vagina thing?

52:56.853 --> 53:00.440
No. Salmon, they swim
upstream... against the current.

53:00.523 --> 53:01.524
Oh.

53:06.237 --> 53:08.448
Wish I'd said goodbye to her.

53:09.700 --> 53:13.244
- But I was dumb. - Mmm-mmm.
Today, you were brave.

53:13.328 --> 53:14.370
Ha!

53:14.454 --> 53:16.247
Horseshit.

53:16.331 --> 53:18.709
I got six weeks extra work duty.

53:18.792 --> 53:21.670
Yeah, but you stood up for yourself,
and that's more than I can say.

53:21.753 --> 53:24.756
No, I just showed them who I really am.

53:24.840 --> 53:28.719
A big, stupid, stubborn...
pussy-loving dyke.

53:28.802 --> 53:33.181
Hey, well, listen, if that's who
you are, then that's who you are.

53:33.264 --> 53:34.850
And there's no use in fightin' it,

53:34.933 --> 53:38.311
and if you ain't gonna fight
it, you might as well embrace it,

53:38.394 --> 53:40.230
or else you're living in purgatory.

53:42.523 --> 53:43.859
Fuck yeah.

53:45.151 --> 53:48.655
Here's to heaven or hell
and nothing in between.

53:48.739 --> 53:49.781
- Boom!
- Boom.

53:50.699 --> 53:53.451
Probably hell, though. I mean,
who the fuck am I kidding?

53:54.620 --> 53:55.787
Oh. [clears throat]

53:58.164 --> 53:59.249
You need to start brushing.

53:59.332 --> 54:00.917
- [groaning]
- No, trust me on this.

54:01.001 --> 54:02.628
Seriously, take it.

54:02.711 --> 54:03.795
Thank you.

54:03.879 --> 54:06.715
- Really?
- [chuckles] Yeah, really.

54:06.798 --> 54:09.217
All right, I'll give it
a go, but I'm telling you,

54:09.300 --> 54:10.510
it's just a waste of my time.

54:10.593 --> 54:13.471
Oh, there is no wiser
schmuck than you, my friend.

54:13.554 --> 54:16.266
- Yeah, no shit. Guess what?
- Hmm?

54:16.349 --> 54:18.018
I'm still taking their money.

54:18.101 --> 54:19.853
[laughing]

54:19.936 --> 54:21.772
I renounce thee, Satan.

54:21.855 --> 54:24.190
Oh, bring that in. Yes!

54:24.274 --> 54:25.316
Whoo!

54:26.192 --> 54:28.278
- [Pennsatucky] Bunch of chumps.
- Mmm.

54:28.361 --> 54:29.946
Tomorrow, we'll talk about flossing.

54:30.030 --> 54:31.156
- The string?
- Yeah, with the string.

54:31.239 --> 54:33.033
- Fuck that.
- No, it's important.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.164
[phone ringing]

54:42.458 --> 54:45.754
- Joe Caputo.
- Joe, Danny Pearson.

54:45.837 --> 54:48.548
Danny, of course.

54:48.631 --> 54:51.301
I hope you don't mind me calling this late.

54:51.384 --> 54:54.262
No, not at all. Did you make it home okay?

54:54.345 --> 54:57.223
I know that last turn at the
end, that left, it's confusing.

54:57.307 --> 55:00.936
Yeah, I made it just fine.
Um, look, I'll keep it short.

55:01.019 --> 55:03.313
MCC is gonna be taking over Litchfield,

55:03.396 --> 55:06.858
effective as soon as the
paperwork goes through.

55:06.942 --> 55:09.194
Holy shit!

55:09.277 --> 55:11.529
I'm sorry. I just...

55:11.612 --> 55:14.657
I thought everything that could
have gone wrong on that tour, did.

55:14.741 --> 55:16.702
Yeah, well, it was a real shit show.

55:16.785 --> 55:19.245
But we toured the maximum security facility

55:19.329 --> 55:20.789
before we came to visit you guys,

55:20.872 --> 55:22.833
and with the number of bodies down there,

55:22.916 --> 55:26.586
and the potential for the unused
space, it was a no-brainer.

55:26.669 --> 55:27.670
Wow.

55:27.754 --> 55:30.799
This is gonna be such a relief for
a lot of people around here, Danny.

55:30.882 --> 55:32.508
Thank your bosses for me.

55:32.592 --> 55:34.803
Oh, I'm glad. I gotta run right now,

55:34.886 --> 55:36.512
but I look forward to
working with you, Joe.

55:36.596 --> 55:38.098
Likewise.

55:38.181 --> 55:41.768
Hey, Danny, thank you
so much, huh? Take care.

55:46.064 --> 55:47.148
[exhales]

55:57.117 --> 55:59.244
Whoo-Hoo!

56:00.453 --> 56:01.872
Whoo-Hoo!

56:02.914 --> 56:04.290
[laughing]

56:08.461 --> 56:10.046
[exclaims]

56:32.903 --> 56:34.237
[snoring]

56:40.660 --> 56:41.870
Huh?

56:41.953 --> 56:43.914
Oh, hell, no!

56:43.997 --> 56:45.248
Too far, too far. Okay.

56:46.499 --> 56:48.334
I hear you.

56:55.133 --> 56:57.177
