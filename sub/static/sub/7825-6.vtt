09:07.390 --> 09:09.320
and I <i>was the entertainment.</i>

09:10.700 --> 09:13.000
<i>But the Lord works
in mysterious ways.</i>

09:13.060 --> 09:14.030

09:14.100 --> 09:15.170
( <i>gasps )</i>

09:15.230 --> 09:17.560
Do you know that
my son, Herschel

09:17.640 --> 09:19.070
was first
in his Yeshiva class.

09:19.140 --> 09:20.170
As a matter of fact,
he was voted

09:20.240 --> 09:21.940
the most likely
to hear God.

09:22.010 --> 09:25.750
Go on, Hyman, you're
exaggerating again.
You're so proud of your son.

09:25.810 --> 09:27.420
A rabbi would
never exaggerate.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.820
A rabbi composes.
He creates thoughts.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.690
He tells stories that
may never have happened,

09:32.750 --> 09:34.620
but he does not exaggerate.

09:34.690 --> 09:36.760
<i>My father would have
never suspected a thing</i>

09:36.820 --> 09:39.190
<i>were it not for
one, rowdy rabbi.</i>

09:39.260 --> 09:40.490
Hey, funny man!

09:40.560 --> 09:42.330
No, no, no!

09:42.390 --> 09:43.920
( <i>crowd laughing )</i>

09:45.130 --> 09:46.130
Herschel?

09:46.200 --> 09:47.200
( <i>crowd gasps )</i>

09:47.270 --> 09:49.200
<i>Herschel,
oy vay iz mir!</i>

09:49.270 --> 09:51.640
You have brought shame
on our family.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.300
If you were a musician
or a jazz singer

09:54.370 --> 09:56.500
this I could forgive,
but this?

09:56.580 --> 09:57.980
<i>I never want
to see you again...</i>

09:58.040 --> 10:00.240
You... you clown!

10:03.010 --> 10:05.380
( <i>sobbing )</i>

10:05.450 --> 10:07.490
I haven't seen
my father since.

10:07.550 --> 10:09.310
That is so sad.

10:09.390 --> 10:11.090
Krusty, do you think about
your father a lot?

10:11.160 --> 10:12.960
All the time.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.650
...except when
I'm at the track.
Then it's all business.

10:20.230 --> 10:21.940
Krusty:
<i>Oh, look..!</i>

10:23.440 --> 10:25.540
Aww... hmm.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.930
Oh, look at you, Bart.

10:28.010 --> 10:30.280
Oh, isn't that fun!

10:30.340 --> 10:32.680
Ooh, hey! Whoa!

10:32.740 --> 10:35.010
Oh, fourth of July.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.020
I can't believe that little boy
in the pictures is you, Bart.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.380
Yeah. I got a lot
of fond memories.

10:41.450 --> 10:43.080
Well, look at the time.

10:43.150 --> 10:44.720
Almost midnight.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.630
Do you have any yearbooks?

10:46.690 --> 10:48.730
No, that's it.
You've seen everything.

10:48.790 --> 10:51.790
So, Milhouse, know any
"knock, knock" jokes?

10:51.860 --> 10:52.720
( <i>crying )</i>

10:52.800 --> 10:54.570
I want to go home.

10:54.630 --> 10:57.660
Homer, maybe you better
take Milhouse home.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.670
Gladly.

11:02.470 --> 11:05.170
Wow! The Concert For Bangladesh.

11:07.810 --> 11:08.640
Bart:
Good night, Krusty.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.170
Sorry about
your Dad.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.490
Don't worry about me--
I'm a survivor.

11:13.550 --> 11:14.790
Hey, did I leave
my keys inside?

11:14.850 --> 11:15.610
All:
No!

11:15.690 --> 11:17.120
Oh, yeah. Here they are.

Let's move.

12:57.420 --> 12:58.490
Reverend Lovejoy

12:58.560 --> 13:00.930
we need you to help
us find a rabbi.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.520
Well, before you make
any rash decisions

13:03.600 --> 13:06.300
let me just remind you
that the church is changing

13:06.360 --> 13:08.190
to meet the needs
of young Christians.

13:08.270 --> 13:09.740
No, no.
We're not converting.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.670
We just want to find
a Rabbi Krustofski.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.640
Rabbi Krustofski..
Wh--, I do a radio
call-in show with him

13:14.710 --> 13:16.340
every Sunday night.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.380
Really?
I didn't know that.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.510
I mention it
in my sermon every week.

13:21.580 --> 13:23.680
Oh, <i>that radio show.</i>

13:23.750 --> 13:27.490
Oh yeah, it's all
the kids talk about
on Monday at school.

13:27.550 --> 13:30.180
Well, why don't you have
a free T-shirt?

13:30.260 --> 13:33.260
You'll be the coolest kids
in the playground.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.950
We'll put them on later.

13:35.030 --> 13:37.260
Now, can you give us
the rabbi's address?

13:37.330 --> 13:38.500
Oh, sure thing.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.860
Let me check my
non-Christian rolodex.

13:40.930 --> 13:42.690
I bet the rabbi
misses Krusty.

Excuse us,
Rabbi Krustofski?

What can I do for you,
my young friend?

13:53.450 --> 13:55.450
We came to talk to you
about your son.

13:55.510 --> 13:57.680
I have no son!

13:57.750 --> 14:01.120
Oh great, we came all this way,
and it's the wrong guy.

14:01.190 --> 14:03.420
I didn't mean that
literally!

14:07.630 --> 14:09.760
Deejay:
And, in order to keep our
broadcasting license

14:09.830 --> 14:11.730
we devote
Sunday night dead time

14:11.800 --> 14:14.570
to public service shows
of limited appeal.

14:14.630 --> 14:17.490
In that spirit, we bring you
<i>Gabbing About God</i>

14:17.570 --> 14:20.610
sponsored by Ace Religious
Supply, where they say

14:20.670 --> 14:22.140
"if we don't got it,
it ain't holy."

14:22.210 --> 14:24.850
With us tonight, once again,
our very own three wise men

14:24.910 --> 14:27.210
Reverend Timothy Lovejoy,
Monsignor Kenneth Daly

14:27.280 --> 14:28.950
and Rabbi
Hyman Krustofski.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.710
- Good to see
you again.
- Nice to see you.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.790
Okay. our first caller
is from Shelbyville Heights.

14:33.850 --> 14:36.160
Man:
Yes hi. With all the suffering
and injustice in the world

14:36.220 --> 14:38.760
do you ever wonder
if God really exists?

14:38.820 --> 14:39.380
No.

14:39.460 --> 14:40.130
Not for a second.

14:40.190 --> 14:41.160
Not at all.

14:41.230 --> 14:42.960
Great.
Good conversation there.

14:43.030 --> 14:45.170
Our next call now is
for the good rabbi.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.500
Hello?

14:46.560 --> 14:47.830
( <i>heavy breathing )
Anybody there?</i>

14:47.900 --> 14:50.340
I hear breathing,
but I don't hear talking.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.340
What's going on, here?
Mister? Hello? Hello?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.160

14:54.240 --> 14:57.480

but call and hang up.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.750
There's all kinds of <i>mishagoyim.</i>

14:59.810 --> 15:01.480
Okay, let's clear the board.
Our next caller is

15:01.550 --> 15:03.480
a young boy from
right here in Springfield .

15:03.550 --> 15:04.820
<i>Bart:
Hello. My name is Dmitri.</i>

15:04.880 --> 15:06.940
<i>I'm a first-time caller,
long-time listener.</i>

15:07.020 --> 15:11.190
My question is...
If a son defies his father
and chooses a career

15:11.260 --> 15:13.960
that makes millions
of children happy

15:14.030 --> 15:15.300
shouldn't the father
forgive the son?

15:15.360 --> 15:15.900
I think so.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.030
Yes, of course.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.500
No way!
Absolutely not!
Never!

15:18.560 --> 15:19.990
Who screens these calls?

15:20.060 --> 15:22.960
Who's in charge here?
There's nobody in charge?

15:23.030 --> 15:24.530
<i>They leave a building
without people watching it?
And anybody--</i>

15:24.600 --> 15:27.600
Don't worry Lise,
I got a plan that can't fail.

15:29.870 --> 15:32.240
Yiddle, my man,
you're a genius.

15:32.310 --> 15:34.180
I love my work.

15:34.250 --> 15:39.150
Oh, the best charity is to give
and not let other people know.

15:39.220 --> 15:43.420
But what if your example
encourages <i>others to give?</i>

15:43.490 --> 15:45.360
Bart:
Speaking
of charity

15:45.420 --> 15:47.820
Rabbi Krustofski,
don't you think it's time
you forgave your son?

15:47.890 --> 15:50.990
Don't you understand,
that my boy broke my heart!

15:51.060 --> 15:51.920
He turned his back
on our traditions

15:52.000 --> 15:53.870
on our faith, and on me.

15:53.930 --> 15:56.340
Get out of here,
you little <i>pisher.</i>

15:56.400 --> 15:57.840
<i>Oy, this guy's tough.</i>

15:57.900 --> 15:59.800
Bart, we're gonna have to
outsmart him.

15:59.870 --> 16:01.080
I don't know.
He's pretty sharp.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.440
He saw right through
this disguise.

16:03.510 --> 16:04.850
What? Saul Bellow?

16:04.910 --> 16:07.450
The Nobel Prize-winning
Jewish novelist?

16:07.510 --> 16:09.620
He wants to have lunch with me?

16:09.680 --> 16:10.720
It's a date.

16:10.780 --> 16:12.750
Izzy's Deli, 1:00.
I'll be there.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.320
The French government

16:14.390 --> 16:16.620
wants to give <i>me
The Legion of Honor?</i>

16:16.690 --> 16:19.230
Where do I receive
this prestigious award?

16:19.290 --> 16:20.390
Izzy's Deli, 1:00.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.460
Thank you, Monsieur President.

16:22.530 --> 16:23.800

16:27.930 --> 16:30.030
Are you kids ready
to order yet?

16:30.100 --> 16:32.970
Sorry, no.
Just get us another bowl
of complimentary pickles.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.410
Watch how fast
I go.

16:35.470 --> 16:36.800
And for you, Sir?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.850
I want a nice sandwich,
but the Joey Bishop--

16:38.910 --> 16:40.710
Too fatty.

16:40.780 --> 16:43.180
The Jackie Mason--
I don't know.
Sauerkraut makes me gassy.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.320
The Bruce Willis?

16:44.380 --> 16:45.540
I don't even
like his work.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.550
What is this--
a Krusty the Clown?

16:47.620 --> 16:50.220
Ham, sausage and bacon,
with a smidge of mayo.

16:50.290 --> 16:50.860
What?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.190
On white bread.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.230
Listen!
You tell
Mr. Saul Bellow

16:54.290 --> 16:55.330
the Nobel Prize-winning
Jewish novelist

16:55.390 --> 16:56.950
that I lost my appetite.

16:59.100 --> 17:02.770
( <i>Krusty humming
"The Marseilles" )</i>

17:02.830 --> 17:06.329
Could you direct me to President
Francois Mitterand's table?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.900
You think you're funny?

17:07.970 --> 17:10.400
50 million Frenchmen
can't be wrong.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.750
( <i>moans )</i>

17:11.810 --> 17:14.250
Bart, we've been going
about this all wrong.

17:14.310 --> 17:17.790
What's the one thing rabbis
prize above everything else?

17:17.849 --> 17:19.450
Those stupid hats?

17:19.520 --> 17:22.220
No, Bart-- knowledge.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.020
<i>We're gonna hit him
where it hurts--</i>

17:24.089 --> 17:25.589
right in the Judaica.

17:31.630 --> 17:33.300
( <i>imitates thunder )</i>

17:33.360 --> 17:34.690
"Glub, glub, glub."

17:34.770 --> 17:36.800
"Oh, Noah, Noah,
save us, save us!"

17:36.870 --> 17:38.140
"No!"

17:38.200 --> 17:40.460
This looks good, Bart.

17:40.540 --> 17:41.780
Take it to him.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.140
You I told to go away.

17:43.210 --> 17:46.280
But-but Rabbi, does it not say
in the Babylonian Talmud

17:46.340 --> 17:49.540
and I quote: "a child
should be pushed aside
with the left hand

17:49.610 --> 17:51.880
and drawn closer
with the right."?

17:51.950 --> 17:53.220
Yes.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.580
Then doesn't your
religion command

17:54.650 --> 17:56.050
you to
make up with Krusty?

17:56.120 --> 17:58.890
But in <i>Exodus,
the Fifth Commandment says</i>

17:58.960 --> 18:01.230
"honor thy father
and thy mother."

18:01.290 --> 18:02.650
End of story.

18:03.930 --> 18:05.200
Oh, it's hopeless.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.690
Not quite.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.790
I got some dynamite stuff
from Rabbi Simon Ben-Eliazar.

18:10.870 --> 18:14.480
"at all times let a man
be supple as a reed

18:14.540 --> 18:17.080
and not rigid
as a cedar."

18:17.140 --> 18:20.910
Bart, my short, learned friend,
the <i>Book of Joshua says</i>

18:20.980 --> 18:24.850
"you shall meditate on the <i>Torah
all day and all night."</i>

18:24.920 --> 18:27.290
( <i>murmured approval )</i>

18:27.350 --> 18:29.220
( <i>yawning )</i>

18:29.290 --> 18:30.860
hmm...

18:32.420 --> 18:34.520
Is it not written
in the <i>Talmud</i>

18:34.590 --> 18:36.450
"who will bring
redemption?

18:36.530 --> 18:37.900
The jesters."

18:37.960 --> 18:39.490
Sorry my friend,
I'm still not convinced

18:39.560 --> 18:41.560
<i>and this is hardly the time
or place to discuss it.</i>

18:44.700 --> 18:46.160
Here you go, Bart.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.210
It's a long shot,
but that's all I can do

18:48.270 --> 18:50.230
without learning
ancient Hebrew.

18:52.180 --> 18:55.750
Bart, I am <i>not going
to learn ancient Hebrew.</i>

18:55.810 --> 18:57.880
Rabbi, did not
a great man say

18:57.950 --> 19:01.890
and I quote, "the Jews are
a swinging bunch of people.

19:01.950 --> 19:04.380
I mean, I've heard
of persecution

19:04.460 --> 19:07.430
"but what they went through
is ridiculous.

19:07.490 --> 19:10.530
"but the great thing is
after thousands of years

19:10.600 --> 19:12.170
"of waiting and
holding on
and fighting

19:12.230 --> 19:13.670
they finally made it."

19:13.730 --> 19:15.040
End quote.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.500
I never heard
the plight of my people

19:17.570 --> 19:19.240
phrased so eloquently.

19:19.300 --> 19:19.900
Who said that?
Rabbi Hillel?

19:19.970 --> 19:20.970
Nope.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.540
- Judah the Pious?
- Nope.

19:22.610 --> 19:23.780
Maimonides?

19:23.840 --> 19:25.180
Ooh, I got it!
The Dead Sea Scrolls!

19:25.240 --> 19:27.070
I'm afraid not, Rabbi.

19:27.150 --> 19:29.920
It's from <i>Yes, I Can,
by Sammy Davis, Jr.</i>

19:29.980 --> 19:31.790
An entertainer,
like your son.

19:31.850 --> 19:34.150
The candy man?

19:34.220 --> 19:38.190
If a performer can think that
way, maybe I'm completely upside
down on this whole problem.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.630
All the years of joy
that I've lost.

19:40.690 --> 19:43.160
Why? Because of
my stubborn ways.

19:43.230 --> 19:44.670
( <i>crying )</i>

19:44.730 --> 19:46.630
There, there, Rabbi.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.740
It's not too late.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.110
( <i>grunting )</i>

19:54.770 --> 19:56.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

19:56.570 --> 19:58.200
Hi, kids.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.650
Today's show's going to be

20:00.710 --> 20:03.880
the funniest, side-splittingest
cavalcade of...

20:03.950 --> 20:05.550
aw, the hell with it.

20:05.620 --> 20:06.890
Roll the cartoon.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.230
Oh, yeah. My old friends,
right next to my heart.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.830
Hey, such
a filthy habit.

20:19.900 --> 20:20.700
Who asked you?

20:21.370 --> 20:22.140
Father?

20:22.200 --> 20:22.800
Son.

20:22.870 --> 20:23.400
Papa!

20:23.470 --> 20:24.070
Herschel!

20:24.140 --> 20:25.110

20:31.480 --> 20:32.580
Oh, uh...

20:32.640 --> 20:34.470
Boys and girls

20:34.550 --> 20:37.020
I'd like to be serious
for a moment, if I may.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.390
Spotlight, please.

20:38.450 --> 20:39.920
I just wanted...

20:39.980 --> 20:40.910
I just want...

20:40.990 --> 20:42.020
Come on, guys.

20:42.090 --> 20:44.090
I'm not doing
the spotlight bit.

20:44.160 --> 20:49.130
Let's have a warm Krusty welcome
for my estranged father

20:49.190 --> 20:51.020
Rabbi Hyman Krustofski.
