WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:06.354
I just got an e-mail saying
that I was randomly selected

00:06.397 --> 00:09.009
to have dinner for two
at The Cooler this weekend.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.054
You know about the volunteer
work I've been doing.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.925
Yeah. Charity for homeless vets.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.884
ABBY:
Aw, is that you?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.712
I was three years old
when she died.So you

00:16.755 --> 00:18.975
volunteer to honor her?

00:19.019 --> 00:19.758
Cheers to you.

00:19.802 --> 00:20.759
For what?

00:20.803 --> 00:22.196
Choosing me to
come with you.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.240
Spare some change?

00:23.284 --> 00:25.677
Oh, yeah, man. Absolutely.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.592
You, too.
Give me your wallet. Now.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.072
ABBY: Maybe
if we could talk,

00:29.116 --> 00:30.247
um, I could help you.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.335
Just take it, yeah?

00:31.379 --> 00:32.728
You want to help me?

00:32.771 --> 00:34.077
Say it. You want to help me?

00:34.121 --> 00:36.123
Yes, I want to help you!You can't!

00:36.166 --> 00:38.168
REEVES: Stop!

00:41.780 --> 00:43.391
VANCE:
Well,

00:43.434 --> 00:45.828
what is your
professional opinion, Jack?

00:45.871 --> 00:48.265
Honestly, I'm stumped.

00:48.309 --> 00:51.790
Gibbs has the best poker
face I've ever seen.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.705
It's like trying
to read a statue.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.794
Mm, that's
his normal state.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.101
Ain't that right, Popeye?

00:58.145 --> 00:59.146
VANCE: There's
no way he can have

00:59.189 --> 01:00.625
five winning hands in a row.

01:01.974 --> 01:02.845
He's got to be bluffing.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.499
I'm not so sure.

01:04.542 --> 01:08.372
He had that same glint in his
eye back when I married Diane

01:08.416 --> 01:10.896
and he no longer
had to pay alimony.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.464
I'm with Tobias on this one.

01:13.508 --> 01:14.726
SLOANE:
All right.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.120
I'll call you, Gibbs.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.514
Let's see 'em!

01:22.908 --> 01:24.258
Oh!

01:24.301 --> 01:25.259
Oh...What did I tell you?!

01:27.304 --> 01:29.045
Ridiculous!

01:29.089 --> 01:31.221
Why do I get the feeling
we're being bamboozled?

01:31.265 --> 01:34.137
Gibbs. Yeah.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.530
Whoa, McGee.

01:35.573 --> 01:38.272
Slow down.
Tell me what happened.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.106
What do we have?

01:46.149 --> 01:48.282
Single GSW
to the left anterior chest.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.849
BP's dropping fast.
Possible hemothorax.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.721
Open thoracotomy
and chest tube.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.766
She's coding!

01:54.810 --> 01:56.290
Prep for it. Let's
go. Crash cart.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.119
Come on, we're losing her.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.340
♪

02:43.728 --> 02:48.516
I came as soon as I heard.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.432
Come on!

02:53.434 --> 02:56.219
How can this happen?

02:56.263 --> 02:58.352
Huh?

02:58.395 --> 03:01.311
Can anyone explain that to me?

03:04.532 --> 03:08.449
Losing anyone you know
is always difficult.

03:08.492 --> 03:12.279
But all we can do
now is our jobs.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.368
Ducky's right.

03:14.411 --> 03:17.240
We have work to do. Let's go.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.901
Dr. Palmer,

03:25.944 --> 03:29.992
performing an autopsy on
a colleague is not an easy task.

03:30.035 --> 03:33.822
So if you prefer
to sit this one out...

03:34.866 --> 03:37.042
Thank you, Doctor.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.827
This is the only way I can help,

03:38.870 --> 03:41.351
and I'm not going anywhere.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.745
Good.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.443
So let us begin.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.805
Any word on Abby?

04:00.849 --> 04:03.939
Nothing yet.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.159
I don't think I can handle

04:07.203 --> 04:09.423
losing another family member
today.

04:09.466 --> 04:13.035
Nor I, Dr. Palmer.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.298
Nor I.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.695
:
Don't worry, Clay.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.263
You're in good hands.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.184
What do we know?

04:32.228 --> 04:33.534
Abby's stable but critical.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.492
The bullet pierced an artery,

04:35.536 --> 04:37.451
but the doctors were able
to stop the bleeding in time.

04:37.494 --> 04:38.626
So she's out of the woods?

04:38.669 --> 04:40.149
Well, it's too
soon to tell.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.630
They said if Abby
doesn't regain consciousness

04:42.673 --> 04:44.414
within the next 48 hours,

04:44.458 --> 04:46.851
the outlook's not so good.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.506
She will. She will, Tim.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.334
MPD find the shooter?

04:51.378 --> 04:53.205
Not yet.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.904
Metro's calling it
a mugging gone wrong,

04:55.947 --> 04:57.471
and the details are limited.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.951
Gibbs isn't gonna like that.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.866
How's he holding up?

05:03.825 --> 05:06.871
He hasn't said a word
since he got here.

05:14.401 --> 05:17.142
I know I let you down, Abbs.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.798
I told you
not to worry.

05:20.842 --> 05:24.367
I said that
I would always keep you safe.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.500
ABBY:
Ari didn't shoot at you

05:26.543 --> 05:28.328
and hit Kate by mistake,
did he?

05:28.371 --> 05:29.677
He's after me now.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.549
I was walking by that window
when he fired.

05:32.593 --> 05:35.378
You're just saying that
to make me feel safe.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.860
I'll keep you safe, Abby.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.167
I promise.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.217
Gibbs?

05:48.260 --> 05:49.349
Hey, boss, where you going?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.089
Keep a promise.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.415
Hi.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.330
Ketchup and prawn?

06:14.374 --> 06:17.289
Reeves knew
they were my favorite.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.856
He, uh...

06:18.900 --> 06:22.120
he special-ordered them
from England.

06:22.164 --> 06:25.123
Kept a stash in his desk for me.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.647
They don't

06:26.690 --> 06:28.997
quite taste the same.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.827
I'm gonna miss him, too.

06:32.870 --> 06:35.482
He was like a brother to me,

06:35.525 --> 06:37.048
and I never got
to tell him that.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.528
Hey, you didn't have to.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.138
Yes.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.444
Yes, I did.

06:41.488 --> 06:44.926
Clay didn't have any family,
Torres.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.755
Us-- we were it.

06:47.798 --> 06:48.886
I mean, he...

06:48.930 --> 06:50.888
he was here, and now he's gone.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.325
Over what, like,
60 bucks in cash?

06:53.369 --> 06:56.590
I mean, does-does that make
any sense to you?

06:56.633 --> 06:58.243
GIBBS:
No.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.636
No, it doesn't.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.073
Any word on Abby?

07:02.117 --> 07:03.684
No, there's no change.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.120
What did MPD say?

07:05.163 --> 07:06.469
The officers on the scene,

07:06.513 --> 07:08.906
uh, they confirmed
that Reeves' wallet

07:08.950 --> 07:10.647
and Abby's purse

07:10.691 --> 07:12.344
were missing,
which supports

07:12.388 --> 07:15.173
the "mugging gone bad" theory.

07:15.217 --> 07:18.873
GIBBS: Witnesses?Uh, several reported hearing
three gunshots,

07:18.916 --> 07:21.136
but no one actually saw
the shooter.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.094
No security cameras in the area.

07:23.138 --> 07:27.142
The only people who know
exactly what happened are...

07:27.185 --> 07:28.665
Reeves, Abby,

07:28.709 --> 07:31.363
and our unidentified mugger.

07:31.407 --> 07:34.192
Right.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.499
Let's get to it.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.902
All right.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.773
Doctor's orders, McGee.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.209
Come on.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.124
You need sustenance.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.648
I'm not hungry.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.041
Well, then at least go outside
and get some fresh air.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.826
Come on, you've been in here
all night.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.436
I'll watch over Abby.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.571
I'm not going anywhere until
I know Abby's gonna be okay.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.094
JIMMY:
That could be days.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.791
Maybe weeks, even.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.880
Then I'll wait.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.450
She is gonna get better, right?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.322
Oh, come on.

08:17.366 --> 08:21.370
This is the indomitable
Abby Sciuto we're talking about.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.285
I don't care what the odds are.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.287
You never
count her out.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.507
Look, I'm scared,
too, but...

08:27.550 --> 08:31.859
she is gonna
pull through this.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.389
Just wish I could help her.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.218
You can.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.351
Just because she's unconscious
doesn't mean she can't hear us.

08:46.395 --> 08:49.485
Isn't that
right, Abby?

08:50.573 --> 08:53.184
Just talk
to her, pal.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.883
Tell her how you feel.

08:57.885 --> 09:01.018
I wouldn't know
where to start.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.246
There you are.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.994
I've been looking
for you all day.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.562
I've been busy.

09:22.605 --> 09:26.957
More like purposely avoiding me.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.177
Reeves was a member
of your team, Gibbs.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.832
You should, uh...
you should talk about it.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.356
Talk?

09:34.399 --> 09:36.837
That gonna help him?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.621
No, but it might help you.

09:38.665 --> 09:42.407
You want to help me, Jack?

09:42.451 --> 09:44.061
Get me some answers.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.628
DUCKY:
I have some.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.630
They may not be the answers
for which

09:47.674 --> 09:50.981
you are looking, but
they could prove useful.

09:51.025 --> 09:55.333
Cause of death was
punctured aorta inflicted by

09:55.377 --> 09:57.248
one of two bullets
to the chest.

09:57.292 --> 10:00.208
We also found bruising
on his hands,

10:00.251 --> 10:02.776
consistent with a struggle.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.647
Kid had a hard life.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.476
Deserved better than this.Dr. Palmer

10:07.519 --> 10:11.001
took the slugs in his clothing
out to the lab for analysis.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.569
Analysis by whom?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.053
Ugh! What is this even saying?

10:19.096 --> 10:21.055
I-I can't understand
a single word.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.709
I thought all you brainy types

10:22.752 --> 10:24.493
would understand
that kind of stuff.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.277
My background
is in analytics,

10:26.321 --> 10:28.062
not molecular science.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.020
It all sounds
like nerd to me.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.327
This thing. Come on. Work!

10:32.370 --> 10:34.503
That's got to be
the blood analysis report

10:34.546 --> 10:35.852
from Reeves' clothes.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.336
Well, this says
there were

10:41.379 --> 10:44.687
two different blood profiles
on Clay's shirt.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.516
Reeves' and Abby's?
No.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.432
One was a match to Clay,
the other's a match to...

10:50.475 --> 10:52.782
former Army Specialist

10:52.826 --> 10:55.437
Kent Marshall,

10:55.480 --> 10:58.962
dishonorably discharged
in 2008.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.182
That's got to be our mugger.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.664
NCIS!

11:10.626 --> 11:13.150
Uh, Gibbs.

11:13.194 --> 11:16.023
I've got an M9 Beretta,

11:16.066 --> 11:17.981
Reeves's wallet, Abby's purse.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.679
Marshall's
definitely our guy.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.681
Bishop.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.073
Huh?

11:24.466 --> 11:26.294
Oof.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.425
Someone got to
Marshall first.

11:28.513 --> 11:29.689
Yeah. Who?

11:29.732 --> 11:31.038
The person who hired him.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.173
It's a dossier on Abby.

11:36.217 --> 11:39.611
This wasn't a random mugging.
This was a hit.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.483
Abby's the target.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.580
BISHOP:
Our dead shooter is

11:51.623 --> 11:53.756
former Army Specialist
Kent Marshall.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.325
Dishonorably discharged in 2010
for disorderly conduct

11:57.368 --> 12:00.328
and aggravated assault.Not the military's finest.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.156
Ballistics on his Beretta
match the slugs

12:02.199 --> 12:03.461
taken from Reeves and Abby.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.159
It's also a match
to six unsolved shootings

12:05.202 --> 12:07.074
in the tristate area.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.511
All right, if Marshall is a gun
for hire, then who hired him?

12:09.554 --> 12:11.382
BISHOP: Well, Abby's
forensics has convicted

12:11.426 --> 12:15.212
hundreds over the years,
but so far, our top suspect

12:15.256 --> 12:17.171
is this guy,
Terry Spooner.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.739
GIBBS: Spooner embezzled
millions in '06.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.306
He hired a hit man to stop Abby
from testifying at his trial.

12:22.350 --> 12:25.179
He was released six months ago
and has been on probation

12:25.222 --> 12:26.876
at a halfway house
in Silver Springs.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.312
Bring him in.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.923
In one piece, Gibbs.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.403
We'll see.

12:32.447 --> 12:35.580
Well, the hospital's on alert

12:35.624 --> 12:39.019
and I've got
Abby's room secured.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.803
I know.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.415
Thanks, Tony. I will.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.853
Well, why do I need
to say it back to you?

12:48.550 --> 12:51.248
All right, fine.
I love you, too.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.815
I'll keep you posted.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.251
Bye.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.212
That was Tony

12:58.255 --> 13:00.301
checking in.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.437
You know, he didn't even
call me a McNickname,

13:06.481 --> 13:10.311
so I know he's really
worried about you.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.969
We all are, Abby.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.235
Abby, do you understand
how serious this is?

13:21.278 --> 13:23.367
Someone wants you dead.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.847
Now, if you
were awake,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.457
you'd probably act like
you weren't scared,

13:26.501 --> 13:27.632
but you know what?

13:27.676 --> 13:30.244
:
It scares me, okay?

13:30.287 --> 13:33.769
It really scares me.

13:33.813 --> 13:38.513
So what I need you to do
is to stop sleeping and wake up.

13:40.167 --> 13:44.867
Abby, please wake up.
Wake up.

13:44.911 --> 13:48.349
Never thought
I'd be back at NCIS.

13:48.392 --> 13:51.178
This place hasn't changed much
in 12 years, has it?

13:51.221 --> 13:53.658
Neither have you.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.486
Um...

13:55.530 --> 13:56.879
You're gonna have to
help me out here

13:56.923 --> 13:58.228
because I have no idea
who this is.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.362
It was the hit man you hired
to kill Abby Sciuto.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.277
BISHOP: You remember
her, right?

14:03.320 --> 14:06.976
Her testimony got you
convicted in 2006.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.673
TORRES: Yeah, the first one
you hired to kill her

14:08.717 --> 14:10.806
couldn't get
the job done,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.026
so you decided
to give it another go.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.505
BISHOP:
Except he failed, too.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.681
So you're oh-for-two, Spooner.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.379
Well, wait a minute.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.990
I admit I've done
some questionable things,

14:21.034 --> 14:22.513
but that's all in the past.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.167
Really?

14:24.211 --> 14:26.909
I spent the last decade
reflecting on all my mistakes.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.606
I have no interest
in repeating them.

14:28.650 --> 14:32.915
Right. So you're making
all new ones,

14:32.959 --> 14:35.396
like killing MI6 Officer
Clayton Reeves.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.093
I have no idea who this is

14:37.137 --> 14:39.487
or what you're talking about.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.403
I have six months left
on my probation.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.144
I wouldn't risk that
for anything.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.799
All I want is to be a free man
and to start over.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.978
As you can see,

14:52.021 --> 14:53.805
my life is
an open book.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.372
Look into me
all you want.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.331
I've got nothing
to hide.

14:57.374 --> 15:00.116
As much as I'd love to say
that we caught the guy

15:00.160 --> 15:01.726
responsible for
Reeves's death...

15:01.770 --> 15:03.119
It's not Spooner.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.688
I-I can't say
he's reformed,

15:06.731 --> 15:10.126
but Spooner's defining
trait is his greed.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.389
What he wants more than anything
right now is his freedom,

15:12.433 --> 15:14.435
not revenge.

15:14.478 --> 15:19.309
Gibbs, this attempt on Abby
wasn't just business.

15:19.353 --> 15:23.400
Whoever is behind this
is someone who is calculating,

15:23.444 --> 15:27.535
connected, and is holding
a serious grudge.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.146
You know anyone
like that?

15:33.584 --> 15:35.456
Yeah, I do.

15:44.769 --> 15:48.382
We meet again, Gibbs.

15:48.425 --> 15:51.428
To what do I owe this...
pleasure?

15:51.472 --> 15:54.605
Sit down, Alejandro.

15:54.649 --> 15:58.044
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.090
I was always raised

16:01.134 --> 16:03.397
to be polite to guests.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.356
My father taught me
that as a child,

16:06.400 --> 16:10.578
before he was murdered
by a coward.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.407
Just like Paloma.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.410
Do not mention
my sister's name again.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.152
Gladly.

16:19.195 --> 16:23.765
You did not come all
this way to provoke me.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.549
You want something.

16:25.593 --> 16:29.727
Judging by your expression,
it must be rather serious.

16:29.771 --> 16:33.427
What

16:33.470 --> 16:35.255
Hmm?

16:52.098 --> 16:54.752
:
Was it you?

16:54.796 --> 16:58.060
And if it was?

16:58.104 --> 17:00.410
Reeves is dead.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.587
Your hit man is dead.

17:03.631 --> 17:07.635
And if Abby does not
pull through,

17:07.678 --> 17:10.420
you will be next.

17:13.554 --> 17:14.903
Abby?

17:14.946 --> 17:18.559
You know me better than that.
If I was gonna order

17:18.602 --> 17:21.257
a hit on anyone,
it'd be you, not Abby.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.650
You threatened her before.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.914
Oh, again, you misunderstand me.

17:25.957 --> 17:29.222
I did not threaten her
back then.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.788
I was trying to warn her.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.573
Warn her about what?

17:32.616 --> 17:34.053
You.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.924
There's a...

17:35.967 --> 17:40.450
cloud of death
that follows you, Gibbs.

17:40.494 --> 17:43.366
Only, it's the ones closest to
you who end up paying the price.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.587
Tell me,

17:46.630 --> 17:48.110
how many have made the mistake

17:48.154 --> 17:51.722
of trusting you
with their lives?

17:51.766 --> 17:55.378
McGEE:
I got one terrorist inside.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.250
I don't know if I got him,
but he stopped shooting.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.339
Shooter!

18:10.828 --> 18:13.570
Protection detail's
over, Kate.

18:13.614 --> 18:14.963
You did good.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.444
For once, DiNozzo's right.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.883
Wow, I thought I'd die before
I ever heard a compl...

18:27.454 --> 18:28.759
NEWSCASTER:
Previously belonged to

18:28.803 --> 18:31.153
former Mossad director,
Eli David.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.155
Isn't that...Where Ziva's
supposed to be staying.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.983
TONY:
Do we know she's dead?

18:35.026 --> 18:37.203
'Cause if we know she's dead,
we're gonna get him.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.596
Yeah, she's dead,
and we will get Kort.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.337
Us, not you.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.773
Oh, yes, me.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.776
We've lost agents before,
haven't we? And when we do,

18:45.820 --> 18:48.127
it's all hands on deck!

18:54.481 --> 18:55.699
Oh, Mike.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.227
REEVES:
Stop!

19:01.270 --> 19:02.706
McGEE:
Abby?

19:02.750 --> 19:05.579
Abby, can you hear me?
It's Tim. Can you hear me?

19:05.622 --> 19:07.624
Listen, you're in
the hospital, okay?

19:07.668 --> 19:09.496
But don't worry,
you're gonna be fine.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.239
:
Reeves...

19:13.282 --> 19:16.546
Is Reeves okay?

19:25.990 --> 19:26.991
SLOANE:
Never seen Torres

19:27.035 --> 19:28.776
so peaceful.

19:28.819 --> 19:32.171
Yeah, I don't know what to do
first, wake him or fire him.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.955
Poor guy,
no one on Gibbs' team

19:33.998 --> 19:35.739
has taken a break
since the shooting.

19:35.783 --> 19:38.351
Okay, give me an update.Update, on it.

19:38.394 --> 19:41.267
Since Abby still can't remember
anything from the shooting,

19:41.310 --> 19:43.051
Bishop and I are looking
at every single one

19:43.094 --> 19:44.270
of the cases she's worked on,

19:44.313 --> 19:46.968
but no one matches
Sloane's profile so far.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.404
That's all you got?

19:48.448 --> 19:52.060
It's a long list, Gibbs.
We're talking 16 years worth.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.627
Do better.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.195
Uh, a little rest might help.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.980
Your team could use a break,
Gibbs, they're running on fumes.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.247
Looks fine to me.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.510
I moisturize.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.077
Gibbs, found something.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.339
I was digging more

20:10.383 --> 20:13.255
into our shooter Kent Marshall,
and discovered

20:13.299 --> 20:14.909
he was deployed
to a security post

20:14.952 --> 20:16.998
in Afghanistan in 2008,

20:17.041 --> 20:18.652
the same time

20:18.695 --> 20:21.655
as Tom Reese, aka
Marine Sergeant Robert King.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.047
Who the hell's he?

20:23.091 --> 20:25.136
Black ops soldier
that tricked Ms. Sciuto

20:25.180 --> 20:27.226
into developing a bioweapon.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.750
She tracked King down
before he could sell it.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.318
Well, he fits our profile.Where's King now?

20:32.361 --> 20:35.495
Serving a life sentence
at Danville Correctional

20:35.538 --> 20:36.757
since 2009.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.846
Bishop, you are with me.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.065
Torres, you're on protection
detail, get over to Abby's,

20:41.109 --> 20:42.241
relieve McGee.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.459
Hey, I've never been there.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.331
What's it like?

20:45.374 --> 20:47.071
Uh, there are no words.

20:49.944 --> 20:50.988
ABBY:
How's it looking?

20:51.032 --> 20:53.426
One second, almost got it.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.297
All right.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.559
There we go.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.082
What do you think?

20:58.126 --> 20:59.562
Not bad.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.652
I guess the tenth time
is the charm.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.175
Getting pigtails
to be symmetrical

21:04.219 --> 21:05.438
is harder than it looks.

21:05.481 --> 21:06.961
You make it look easy.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.268
Well, not anymore.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.965
What's wrong?

21:11.008 --> 21:14.969
I just hate
feeling helpless, McGee.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.145
How are we supposed
to solve this case

21:17.188 --> 21:20.017
when I can't even fix
my own hair?

21:20.061 --> 21:22.324
Look, you just need
to give yourself more time.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.327
You know who doesn't have time?

21:25.371 --> 21:27.286
Reeves.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.593
I was the target, McGee.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.029
Me.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.335
I'm the one

21:33.379 --> 21:36.077
that should be dead, not him.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.818
Abby...

21:37.861 --> 21:40.124
You expecting someone?

21:40.168 --> 21:41.169
Just a delivery,

21:41.212 --> 21:44.172
of a customized
studded arm sling.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.956
TORRES: Hey,
McGee? Torres.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.874
Hey.
Hey.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.963
TORRES: Gibbs wants you
back at headquarters.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.313
All right,
just stay alert.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.315
Okay? Sergeant King
has a rolodex

21:56.358 --> 21:58.317
full of black ops
killers at his disposal.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.101
No such thing as
being too careful.

22:00.144 --> 22:04.410
You don't have to remind me
how ruthless King is.

22:04.453 --> 22:07.238
You're under arrest
for the murder

22:07.282 --> 22:09.371
of Nurse Hannah Dunstan.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.808
That is correct, and many,
many more bad things.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.375
Little tip: next time
you're playing chess

22:13.419 --> 22:14.898
with a forensic
specialist...

22:14.942 --> 22:16.204
Wear gloves.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.729
Why?

22:19.773 --> 22:23.254
Kept you from asking
too many questions.

22:25.300 --> 22:30.261
Why can I remember
everything about King,

22:30.305 --> 22:33.134
and nothing about the shooting?

22:33.177 --> 22:37.399
I mean, there could be
a vital clue hidden in there.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.488
And I don't know it.

22:39.532 --> 22:42.491
I have to remember.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.972
I have to.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.756
King's been a problem inmate
since he arrived.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.150
Always causing
some sort of trouble.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.586
Just last week, he started
a brawl in the yard.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.066
Is that why
he's in solitary confinement?

22:52.109 --> 22:53.589
Yes, ma'am.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.157
Going on a week now, which
is why I doubt he's your man.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.854
Yeah, why is that?

22:57.898 --> 23:00.161
We monitor all inmate
communication with the outside.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.510
Since King's
been in the SHU,

23:01.554 --> 23:03.382
he hasn't been in
contact with anyone.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.340
I'd rather ask him myself.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.820
Have at it.

23:06.863 --> 23:07.821
Open 12.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.999
King, front and center.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.872
Now.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.439
Don't make me ask you again.

23:20.573 --> 23:23.880
Uh, Gibbs?

23:26.056 --> 23:28.015
That's not Sergeant King.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.671
GIBBS:
Brendan Denridge.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.891
You're a night-shift guard
in the solitary wing.

23:34.935 --> 23:38.155
Until you swapped places
with King to help him escape.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.157
And you thought
that was a good plan?

23:40.201 --> 23:42.203
I had no choice.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.987
He threatened my family.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.773
Said if I didn't go
along with it, he'd kill them.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.992
You're the guard,
King was the inmate.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.516
I mean, you're the one
with all the power.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.300
Are you kidding?

23:52.343 --> 23:57.087
His black op connections are
legendary inside that prison.

23:57.131 --> 24:01.309
He had photos of
my grandkids at school.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.224
What would you have done?

24:04.530 --> 24:06.009
That fight that King started
in the yard.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.315
That was a setup.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.665
He wanted to get
sent to the SHU.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.232
Yeah.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.234
Okay, why now?

24:13.277 --> 24:15.018
All King talked about

24:15.062 --> 24:18.369
was leaving the country once
he had a few loose ends tied up.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.330
That's a coffin.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.114
Like-like, that's, like,
a real coffin.

24:24.158 --> 24:27.030
I thought McGee
was messing with me, man.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.510
Wow.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.556
Hey, this place is awesome.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.383
How come you never
invited me over?

24:36.431 --> 24:39.434
You got to give me the number
of whoever designed this closet.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.088
It is legit.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.524
Later, Torres, I'm trying

24:42.568 --> 24:44.178
to go back through
everything that happened

24:44.221 --> 24:47.398
leading up to the shooting, and
see if it will jog my memory.

24:47.442 --> 24:48.617
Nothing yet?

24:48.661 --> 24:50.489
No, but, uh,
come here, check this out.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.186
Remember that e-mail

24:52.229 --> 24:56.103
that I got, saying I had been
randomly selected for the dinner

24:56.146 --> 24:57.408
at The Cooler?
Yeah.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.932
Well, it didn't come
from the restaurant.

24:58.975 --> 25:02.152
Someone hacked into their
online booking system,

25:02.196 --> 25:04.024
created a reservation
and sent it to me.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.330
It was a setup,
to try to get me there.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.418
You think it was King?

25:07.462 --> 25:08.855
I'm not sure.

25:08.898 --> 25:11.640
But I do have
the hacker's I.P. address.

25:11.684 --> 25:15.383
So if he uses public Wi-Fi
anywhere in the city,

25:15.426 --> 25:16.689
I'm gonna find him.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.039
He messed with
the wrong forensic scientist.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.302
Yep. Never want to
get on your bad side.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.044
I got him.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.307
Where?
Arlington Heights.

25:26.350 --> 25:30.354
Um, call Gibbs, and tell him
I'm gonna send him an address.

25:34.141 --> 25:36.578
The place looks like it hasn't
been opened in years, boss.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.798
BISHOP:
Nothing in the back, either.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.277
Abby must've gotten
the address wrong.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.975
When has that
ever happened?

25:42.018 --> 25:44.934
She sent us to the wrong
location on purpose.

25:44.978 --> 25:45.935
Why would she do that?

25:45.979 --> 25:47.894
Boss, you don't think that...

25:53.290 --> 25:54.640
Hey, Tom.

25:54.683 --> 25:57.860
Or Robert.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.297
Or whatever you're calling
yourself these days.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.432
Surprised to see me?

26:16.052 --> 26:17.445
No backup?

26:17.488 --> 26:18.489
Nope.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.056
Not this time.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.536
I came alone.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.539
I'm impressed.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.411
Impressed that I'm still alive?

26:27.455 --> 26:30.632
Or impressed that I tracked
you down a second time?

26:32.242 --> 26:35.419
That you have the guts
to face me yourself.

26:35.463 --> 26:38.640
Don't think for a second
you intimidate me.

26:38.684 --> 26:42.644
Well, if you're not gonna
arrest me, uh, why are you here?

26:42.688 --> 26:45.516
Rule 45.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.475
What does that mean?

26:47.518 --> 26:50.086
You'll find out soon enough.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.785
Well, in that case, have a seat.

26:55.788 --> 26:59.487
Nothing. I mean,
Torres and Abby are gone.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.881
You really think Abby
went to confront King?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.536
"Rule 45."

27:05.580 --> 27:07.277
"Clean up your mess."

27:07.321 --> 27:08.627
There's no way Torres
would've gone along with this.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.411
I mean, something
must've happened.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.413
Call him. McGee?

27:12.456 --> 27:14.284
Get over here,
find out where she went.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.637
Do you hear that?

27:18.680 --> 27:21.901
That's Torres's cell phone.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.729
What?

27:23.772 --> 27:26.296
What is this doing here: Hello?

27:26.340 --> 27:27.689
Is anybody out there?

27:27.733 --> 27:28.603
Torres?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.518
Get me out of here.Yep.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.302
It's locked.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.000
Get me out of here.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.527
You okay

27:39.570 --> 27:40.354
What is wrong with you, Bishop?

27:41.747 --> 27:43.096
You know what goes
through a person's head

27:43.139 --> 27:44.750
when they're locked
into a coffin?!

27:44.793 --> 27:46.447
W

27:46.490 --> 27:47.622
She played me, Gibbs.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.624
She played me, man.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.626
She bet me that
I couldn't get in there,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.149
'cause I was too afraid.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.412
I get in and then
she locks me inside.

27:55.456 --> 27:56.718
I don't like this new Abby.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.546
Did she tell you
where she was going?

27:58.589 --> 28:00.026
Yeah, she's confronting King.

28:02.593 --> 28:05.118
She said she didn't want anybody
else to die because of her.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.555
Boss, I think I found her.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.774
She tracked King

28:08.817 --> 28:11.515
to a café in Georgetown.

28:13.822 --> 28:16.738
If you've got something
to say, now's the time.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.480
After all the horrible things
you've done,

28:19.523 --> 28:22.048
how can you live with yourself?

28:22.091 --> 28:27.140
Well, what you call "horrible,"
I call "necessary."

28:27.183 --> 28:29.316
You can't justify murder.

28:29.359 --> 28:32.841
My friend is dead
because of you.

28:32.885 --> 28:35.670
Your hands aren't clean,
either, sunshine.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.021
You know, hundreds of soldiers
are dead because of you.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.110
What are you talking about?

28:41.154 --> 28:43.678
Every troop that died overseas
while I was locked up?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.768
My work could've
prevented it all.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.770
No, their blood's on your hands.

28:48.814 --> 28:52.295
You think
you're some kind of savior?

28:52.339 --> 28:54.820
You're a bioweapons terrorist.

28:56.299 --> 28:59.694
I'm the kind of patriot
this country needs.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.478
Someone who's not afraid
to get his hands dirty

29:01.522 --> 29:03.089
to get the job done.

29:03.132 --> 29:06.832
"The job."

29:06.875 --> 29:09.704
Okay, that's why
you're out now.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.402
What kind of weapon
are you developing now?

29:12.446 --> 29:13.534
I wouldn't
concern yourself

29:13.577 --> 29:15.884
with the details.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.844
Don't make the same mistake
as your friend.

29:20.976 --> 29:23.805
Know when you're beaten.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.245
Move, and she dies.All right, man, look,
just take it easy.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.727
You're not here for money.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.860
Who sent you?

29:35.774 --> 29:36.905
Stop!

29:54.009 --> 29:56.011
Clay.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.020
Clay?

30:07.414 --> 30:09.372
Reeves saved me.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.113
Casualty of war.

30:11.157 --> 30:13.899
He hadn't interfered,
he might still be alive.

30:13.942 --> 30:18.817
I've spent my whole life
putting bad guys behind bars.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.862
And every time we stop one,

30:20.906 --> 30:23.952
someone else
just takes their place.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.737
You can't change human nature.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.655
Well, I have a
flight to catch.

30:31.699 --> 30:34.223
Looks like our rematch
will have to wait.

30:34.267 --> 30:37.096
Oh, we're not finished here.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.488
It's a stalemate.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.099
You haven't got a move to make.

30:40.142 --> 30:44.407
I made my move
before I sat down.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.150
Slipped some cyanide
into your coffee

30:48.194 --> 30:50.239
before the waitress
gave it to you.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.589
Enough to kill you.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.548
I mean, not immediately.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.942
But within the hour.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.945
"A" for effort, sunshine.

30:59.988 --> 31:03.862
Now, you're not capable
of killing anyone.

31:03.905 --> 31:07.474
Kate. Jenny.

31:07.517 --> 31:12.174
Dorneget. Ziva. Reeves.

31:12.218 --> 31:17.179
I am tired
of my hero friends dying

31:17.223 --> 31:20.182
while villains
like you get to live.

31:20.226 --> 31:24.099
Everyone has their breaking
point, and this was mine.

31:26.145 --> 31:28.016
Airway constriction.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.279
It's one of the first symptoms.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.281
Shortness of breath,

31:32.325 --> 31:36.242
dizziness,
chest pains.

31:36.285 --> 31:40.855
You'll be in full cardiac arrest
in, like, ten minutes.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.858
I mean,

31:43.902 --> 31:48.819
unless you happen
to have some hydrocobalamin

31:48.863 --> 31:51.257
on you.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.650
Like this.

31:55.435 --> 31:58.481
Confess and you get to live.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.181
You're insane.

32:02.224 --> 32:07.316
Sometimes you have to get your
hands dirty to get the job done.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.711
Fine.

32:10.754 --> 32:12.931
I hired Marshall
to take you out,

32:12.974 --> 32:15.281
but just you.

32:15.324 --> 32:18.110
Your friend wasn't part
of the plan.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.938
Satisfied?

32:25.595 --> 32:28.294
You may not
deserve to live,

32:28.337 --> 32:31.775
but I will never stoop
to your level.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.826
I'll be seeing you.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.395
Checkmate.

32:44.397 --> 32:47.400
Hey, you going somewhere?

32:47.443 --> 32:49.793
Should've learned your lesson
the first time.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.230
Don't mess with Abby.

32:51.273 --> 32:54.102
:
You really think this is over?

32:54.146 --> 32:56.191
Go on. Lock me up.
I'll find a way to escape.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.986
Oh, that was good.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.861
I got him, Clay.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.994
Sorry it took so long.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.739
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.048
Oh.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.312
We got your wallet back.

33:32.662 --> 33:37.058
I know how much this picture
meant to you.

33:37.102 --> 33:42.281
I just thought...
you'd want it close by.

33:46.024 --> 33:51.507
I remember what you said about
wanting to honor your mother...

33:53.509 --> 33:56.469
...and I'm gonna
make that happen.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.650
I promise.

34:03.693 --> 34:06.218
I'm not gonna let you down,
Clay.

34:17.229 --> 34:20.667
So, Abby didn't slip cyanide
into King's drink?

34:20.710 --> 34:24.497
Nope. She laced his coffee
with crushed up Caf-Pow! pills.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.933
And the surge of caffeine
jolted his heart rate

34:25.976 --> 34:27.543
to mimic some of the symptoms.

34:27.587 --> 34:30.590
The rest was brought up purely
by the power of suggestion.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.157
It's genius.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.462
It's Abby.

34:33.506 --> 34:34.768
Well, does anyone know

34:34.811 --> 34:37.249
what this big announcement
of hers is?

34:37.292 --> 34:38.554
I don't know.
Maybe it's apologizing

34:38.598 --> 34:40.252
for locking me in a coffin!

34:41.427 --> 34:42.906
Not exactly.

34:42.950 --> 34:47.302
But... I am sorry
about that, Nick.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.564
JIMMY:
All right, so...

34:48.608 --> 34:50.697
what is the big announcement?

34:50.740 --> 34:54.092
Well...
Reeves wanted to be buried

34:54.135 --> 34:55.876
next to his mother in London,

34:55.919 --> 35:00.010
so... I'm gonna escort
his body there tomorrow

35:00.054 --> 35:01.490
and make the arrangements.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.014
I know he would like that, Abbs.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.234
And when are you coming back?

35:09.585 --> 35:14.112
Um, I'm not coming back.

35:17.898 --> 35:22.076
Wh... you mean not till
after the funeral, right?

35:23.730 --> 35:26.646
I-I mean...

35:26.689 --> 35:28.474
I'm leaving NCIS.

35:31.564 --> 35:34.393
Leaving?

35:34.436 --> 35:39.833
Clay died saving my life
and I owe him a debt,

35:39.876 --> 35:43.532
and I intend to
see it through.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.621
What do you mean by that?

35:45.665 --> 35:51.061
Clay always wanted to start
a charity in honor of his mom.

35:51.105 --> 35:55.718
And since he's not here
to make that happen,

35:55.762 --> 35:59.635
um... I will.

35:59.679 --> 36:02.812
I know you may
not understand,

36:02.856 --> 36:05.815
but it's something
that I have to do.

36:05.859 --> 36:10.342
And not just for him,
but for me.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.605
BISHOP:
Well...

36:12.648 --> 36:16.652
if that's what you want,
Abbs, we...

36:16.696 --> 36:19.612
we will support you 100%.

36:19.655 --> 36:20.917
Well said.

36:22.528 --> 36:26.575
Dr. Palmer,
isn't that so?

36:26.619 --> 36:28.098
Uh, yes, of course.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.100
Um, Abby, of course
we support you.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.493
It's just... I'm sorry.

36:31.537 --> 36:35.758
The-the thought of you
not being here...

36:35.802 --> 36:39.066
just can't imagine it.

36:39.109 --> 36:42.330
It wasn't an easy decision.

36:42.374 --> 36:47.117
I mean, you guys are my family
and this is my home.

36:47.161 --> 36:50.773
But you have to
go with your gut

36:50.817 --> 36:55.909
and my gut is telling me
that I have to go.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.568
McGee?

37:10.576 --> 37:13.535
I have never been so proud
to call you my friend

37:13.579 --> 37:14.928
than I am now.

37:17.670 --> 37:20.760
I just don't think I can
say good-bye to you.

37:20.803 --> 37:24.546
It's-it's not
good-bye for good.

37:24.590 --> 37:27.593
It's just good-bye for now.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.596
I'm gonna miss you.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.163
I'll miss you more.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.277
Ducky.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.706
ABBY:
"Hey, Gibbs.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.404
"You're probably wondering

38:39.447 --> 38:42.145
"what's with
the retro communication.

38:42.189 --> 38:45.366
"Truth is, I chickened out.

38:45.410 --> 38:50.632
"I was afraid that if you asked me to stay, I might waiver

38:50.676 --> 38:54.767
"because there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.856
"When I think back

38:56.899 --> 38:59.989
"on when things in my life
got difficult,

39:00.033 --> 39:03.863
"you were always there to tell
me that it would be okay.

39:03.906 --> 39:09.172
"And it would be because
you would make it okay.

39:09.216 --> 39:12.698
"But Gibbs, Reeves is gone

39:12.741 --> 39:16.049
"and it's not something
anyone can fix,

39:16.092 --> 39:18.660
"not even you.

39:18.704 --> 39:22.229
"I hope you know
what you mean to me, Gibbs.

39:22.272 --> 39:27.408
"Every moment, every lesson,
every hug.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.802
"I'm thankful for it all.

39:29.845 --> 39:33.066
"No matter what we faced
over the years,

39:33.109 --> 39:37.853
there was only ever one thing
I needed to hear from you."

39:37.897 --> 39:40.203
Tell me that I made a mistake.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.902
No, I can't say that.

39:42.945 --> 39:45.818
Then...

39:45.861 --> 39:48.821
tell me how much I've been
like a daughter to you

39:48.864 --> 39:51.301
and how much you love me.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.655
Will that help?

39:56.698 --> 39:59.266
No.

40:02.400 --> 40:07.317
What I really need
to know, Gibbs...

40:07.361 --> 40:10.364
is if you're
gonna love me...

40:10.408 --> 40:12.845
