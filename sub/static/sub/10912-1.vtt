06:29.180 --> 06:31.774
Mm-hmm. Oh, uh-huh.

Good work, Boomer.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.299
Shh! I think he's in there.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.967
Whew!

06:58.043 --> 07:00.717
Am I glad I found you boys.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.799
There's no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.226

07:06.301 --> 07:09.350
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.697
Oh, poor little guy.

07:29.407 --> 07:33.037
Don't you worry now. We're going
to find someone to look after you.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.757
Hmm.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.178
Hmm.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.765
Hey, I think I got an idea.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.650
OK, Boomer, now you
know what to do.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.227
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.535
Who is it?

08:08.279 --> 08:11.249
Well, I was sure I heard
someone knocking.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.703
Oh, dear! My laundry!

08:18.123 --> 08:20.751
Oh, here! Stop it!

08:24.671 --> 08:28.596
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.598
Oh, stop!

08:34.431 --> 08:38.152
Well, I wonder what
got into those birds.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.066
Well, bless my soul!

08:45.442 --> 08:47.570
Why, it's...

08:47.652 --> 08:50.030
It's a baby fox.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.533
Oh.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.539
Hello, little fella.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.087
I wonder where its mother is.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.044
Come on, now. I'm not
going to harm you.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.222
Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?

09:07.297 --> 09:11.552
Oh, my, my. You're a feisty
little rascal, aren't you?

09:11.634 --> 09:15.684
There, there, now. Calm down.

09:15.764 --> 09:19.564
No, I just can't leave
you out here all alone.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.986
Oh, isn't he darling?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.945
Now, not so fast.

09:26.024 --> 09:29.403
Now, now, not so fast.

09:32.447 --> 09:36.668
Oh, my. You're such
a little toddler.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.541
Say, that's what I'm
going to call you.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.960
Tod.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.217
You know, Tod,

09:48.296 --> 09:51.550
I'm not going to be
so lonesome anymore.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.954
I got a surprise for
you, Chief, old boy.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.538
Now, now, now, take it easy.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.546
Well, how's this for a huntin' dog?

10:30.588 --> 10:33.558
He's just a little runt
now, but he'll grow.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.607
You may as well get
used to him, Chief.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.163
He's for you to look
after from now on.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.644
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.

12:00.929 --> 12:05.025
Abigail, you're going to
have to be patient with Tod.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.898
He's one of the family now.

12:13.775 --> 12:17.075
Oh, of course. Now I know.

12:21.115 --> 12:24.460
I declare, I never will
get my chores done.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.179
Oh, mercy!

12:40.218 --> 12:42.812
Tod! Tod, stop it!

12:42.887 --> 12:44.935
Abigail! Abigail!

12:45.014 --> 12:48.644
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!

12:50.019 --> 12:52.192
Easy, easy, Abigail.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.446
Steady, old girl. Steady.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.368
There, there.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.038
Tod, you come here.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.916
I said come here!

13:12.375 --> 13:14.548
Just look what you've done.

13:22.385 --> 13:26.185
Now, don't try to butter me up.

13:28.224 --> 13:32.479
Oh, Tod, I just can't
stay angry with you.

13:32.562 --> 13:36.157
You little imp. Now
run along and play.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.825
Go on.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.369
And try to stay out of mischief.

13:51.914 --> 13:56.044
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.970
Is this it, Boomer?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.767
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.766
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.520
He won't get away this time.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.777
Hold it, Boomer. I think
I hear somethin'.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.700
That's him, all right, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.326
Shh, shh. Get ready, Boomer.

14:23.404 --> 14:27.375
Hey, I can hear him movin'. Listen.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.418
That's funny. I don't hear nothin'.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.788
Shh! Quiet.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.795
Oh, that's him, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.301
Button your beak, will ya?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.179
I'll check it out.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.227
Would you look at that?

14:49.555 --> 14:53.901
OK, Boomer, he's right... there.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.944
Yikes! Watch it!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.656
Why, you...

15:12.578 --> 15:14.330
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!

15:14.414 --> 15:15.916
Hiya, fellas.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.002
What ya doin'? Wanna play?

15:19.085 --> 15:22.339
Stay outta this, kid.
This don't concern you.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.511
Let him have it!

15:31.597 --> 15:35.022
Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!

15:37.061 --> 15:39.780
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!

15:43.234 --> 15:44.360
Aaah!

15:45.903 --> 15:48.031
- Which way did he go?
- This way.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.377
There he is!

16:05.882 --> 16:08.681
What happened to ya? Golly!

16:08.759 --> 16:12.354
Oh, shucks! I think
I bent my b-b-beak.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.354
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.686
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.

16:17.768 --> 16:21.363
- What are you talkin', my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:21.439 --> 16:24.113
A worm? For breakfast?

16:24.192 --> 16:26.240
Yuck! Blecch!

16:52.929 --> 16:55.603
Hey, there, Copper,
what ya sniff in' at?

16:55.681 --> 16:59.231
Somethin'... I never smelled...

16:59.310 --> 17:01.779
before, Chief.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.447
Huh. Let me see.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.319
Ah, shucks, that's easy.

17:08.402 --> 17:12.327
The master's just cookin' grits and
fatback. You oughta know that.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.749
Mm-mmm.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.541
That's not what I smell.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.166
I don't know, Chief.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.544
It's something else.

17:20.623 --> 17:25.049
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to
do about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.550
Hey, where you goin'?

17:27.630 --> 17:30.884
I want to find out
what that smell is.

17:30.967 --> 17:35.017
OK, Copper, but the master ain't
gonna like you wanderin' off.

17:35.096 --> 17:39.067
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.690
Can't tell these young
whippersnappers anything.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.513
What ya smellin'?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.680
I'm on the trail of somethin'.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.854
Trail of what?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.394
I don't know yet.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.488
Why, it's... it's you!

18:29.233 --> 18:30.655
What do you do that for?

18:30.735 --> 18:34.990
We're supposed to do that when
we find what we've been trackin'.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.870
I'm a fox.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.247
My name's Tod. What's
your name, kid?

18:39.327 --> 18:43.252
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.175
Gee, I bet you'd be good
playin' hide-and-seek.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.173
Wanna try it, Copper?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.300
Can I use my nose?

18:51.797 --> 18:53.515
Sure. OK.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.969
Now go ahead and close
your eyes and count.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.856
One, two, three...

19:01.682 --> 19:03.525
No, Copper! You can't peek!

19:03.601 --> 19:06.855
- Oh.
- Now start again.

19:06.937 --> 19:11.192
One, two, three, four,

19:11.275 --> 19:13.869
five, six, seven...

19:13.944 --> 19:17.494
My, my. Look at that.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.328
A fox and a hound,
playin' together.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.883
<i>When you're the best of friends</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:36.434
<i>Having so much fun together</i>

19:36.509 --> 19:40.855
<i>You're not even aware
you're such a funny pair</i>

19:40.930 --> 19:44.355
<i>You're the best of friends</i>

19:44.433 --> 19:46.982
<i>Life's a happy game</i>

19:48.437 --> 19:52.362
<i>You could clown around forever</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:56.867
<i>Neither one of you sees
your natural boundaries</i>

19:56.946 --> 19:59.790
<i>Life's one happy game</i>

19:59.865 --> 20:03.415
Copper!

20:03.494 --> 20:05.462
Gee, I've gotta go.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.299
<i>If only the world
wouldn't get in the way</i>

20:13.379 --> 20:16.929
<i>If only people would
just let you play</i>

20:17.007 --> 20:20.637
<i>They say you're both being fools</i>

20:20.720 --> 20:24.270
<i>You're breaking all the rules</i>

20:25.683 --> 20:28.311
<i>They can't understand</i>

20:29.854 --> 20:33.199
<i>The magic of your wonderland</i>

20:40.489 --> 20:42.912
<i>When you're the best of friends</i>

20:43.576 --> 20:44.577
Copper!

20:44.660 --> 20:48.585
<i>Sharing all that you discover</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:53.465
<i>When these moments have passed
Will that friendship last?</i>

20:53.544 --> 20:55.546
<i>Who can say?</i>

20:55.629 --> 20:57.597
There's a way

20:57.673 --> 20:59.926
<i>Oh, I hope</i>

21:00.009 --> 21:02.603
<i>I hope it never ends</i>

21:02.678 --> 21:04.601
Come on, Copper!

21:04.680 --> 21:10.608
<i>'Cause you're the best of friends</i>

21:23.240 --> 21:26.460
Copper, you're my very best friend.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.583
And you're mine too, Tod.

21:28.662 --> 21:32.917
And we'll always be friends
forever, won't we?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.798
Yeah, forever.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.051
Hey, let's go swimmin'!

21:38.130 --> 21:40.553
Give me a head start
and I can beat ya!

21:55.397 --> 21:56.819
Whoo!

21:57.525 --> 22:00.995
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's
gone and strayed off again.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.697
Come on, Chief.

22:02.780 --> 22:06.000
If that little rascal's gonna
make me a good huntin' dog,

22:06.075 --> 22:07.793
he's gotta learn to mind.

22:12.122 --> 22:16.093
Copper! Get over here!

22:16.168 --> 22:19.297
Copper!

22:19.380 --> 22:22.930
Uh-oh. I gotta go home.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.761
Do ya have to? We're
havin' too much fun.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.900
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.898
I'll see ya tomorrow!

22:32.977 --> 22:35.275
- And don't forget!
- I won't!

22:48.993 --> 22:51.587
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?

22:51.662 --> 22:53.539
Why didn't you...?

22:53.622 --> 22:56.250
Golly! You're all tied up.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.552
Yeah, and it's no fun either.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.925
The master says I gotta stay home.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.884
Well, we can play around here then.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.847
Oh, no. Not with old
Chief over there.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.525
Is that him making
that awful noise?

23:13.601 --> 23:15.854
He keeps me awake at night.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.739
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!

23:22.818 --> 23:24.240
He's cranky.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.913
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.875
His ears isn't as big
as yours, Copper.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.924
That's not the part you
gotta worry about.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.546
Wow! Look at those teeth.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.257
That's the part you
gotta worry about!

23:45.174 --> 23:47.552
I'm gainin' on him.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.933
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!

23:50.846 --> 23:52.223
Get out, Tod!

23:52.306 --> 23:56.732
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin'.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.734
When I get him cornered...

23:59.813 --> 24:04.068
It's... It's... It's
a big old badger.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.746
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.449
No, no, it ain't a badger.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.704
It's a... It's a f...

24:15.871 --> 24:18.044
It's a fox. A fox?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.725
Run, Tod! Run!

26:20.829 --> 26:22.797
Tod!

26:48.482 --> 26:51.452
Amos Slade, you
trigger-happy lunatic!

26:51.527 --> 26:53.370
Give me that gun!

27:02.037 --> 27:04.290
My radiator!

27:04.373 --> 27:06.626
Why, you blasted female.

27:06.708 --> 27:10.429
- I'll... I'll...
- Hold it right there!

27:10.504 --> 27:12.973
Watch it! That thing's loaded!

27:17.094 --> 27:19.062
Now it ain't loaded!

27:20.514 --> 27:25.111
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin'
fox was after my chickens!

27:25.185 --> 27:27.483
Rubbish and poppycock!

27:27.563 --> 27:30.487
I don't believe it. He
wouldn't hurt a thing.

27:30.566 --> 27:34.161
You callin' me a liar,
you muddleheaded female?

27:34.236 --> 27:37.160
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours

27:37.239 --> 27:39.492
is going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

27:39.575 --> 27:40.827
Temper?

27:40.909 --> 27:44.038
Temper, woman? You
ain't seen my temper!

27:45.330 --> 27:49.836
If I ever catch that fox on my
property again, I'll blast him!

27:49.918 --> 27:52.967
And next time, I won't miss!

28:01.930 --> 28:03.932
Poor little tyke.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.111
It's a shame I have to
keep him cooped up.

28:11.607 --> 28:15.202
Tod, stop looking at me like that.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.746
It's not my fault, you know.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.449
You caused a lot of
trouble yesterday.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.629
Oh, now what are they up to?

28:30.709 --> 28:34.304
Why, it looks like Amos is
going on a hunting trip.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.891
A long one, from the looks of it.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.936
Hmm. Well, good riddance!

28:53.315 --> 28:55.989
Doggone meddlin' female,

28:56.068 --> 28:58.617
shootin' up my radiator!

28:58.695 --> 29:01.289
Dad blame it. Get goin'!

29:01.365 --> 29:05.962
There. Well, that's more like it.
Keep runnin', old girl.

29:08.038 --> 29:12.259
Well, Copper, me and old Chief are
gonna teach you all about huntin'.

29:12.334 --> 29:15.679
Yes, sir. It's about time too.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.387
Attaboy.

29:20.342 --> 29:23.471
Yeah, you're gonna like trackin'
down those varmints for me.

29:30.644 --> 29:33.523
Uh-uh. Get in the back, half-pint.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.609
You gotta earn your
right to sit up front.

29:46.660 --> 29:50.915
Well, boys, we're gettin'
outta here till next spring.

30:20.902 --> 30:24.532
Tod, honey, what are
you doin' over here?

30:24.614 --> 30:28.494
Gee, I just wanted to
say goodbye to Copper,

30:28.577 --> 30:30.204
but I'm too late.

30:30.287 --> 30:33.257
Well, what did you plan to
do if you ran into old Chief?

30:34.791 --> 30:40.013
Ah, Chief. I can outfox
that dumb old dog anytime.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.386
Tod, now hold it just one minute.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.185
Didn't you learn
anything yesterday?

30:45.260 --> 30:47.228
Now you listen good, Tod,

30:47.304 --> 30:49.898
because it's either
education or elimination.

30:51.308 --> 30:54.528
Now if you're so foxy and
old Chief's so dumb,

30:54.603 --> 30:57.197
then why does that hound
get the fox on the run?

30:57.272 --> 31:00.697
'Cause he's got the hunter, and
the hunter's got the gun. Ka-bam!

31:00.776 --> 31:03.120
Elimination. Lack of education.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.750
<i>If you pal around with
that Copper hound</i>

31:08.825 --> 31:11.203
<i>You'll wind up hangin' on the wall</i>

31:11.286 --> 31:13.914
<i>Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin</i>

31:13.997 --> 31:17.297
<i>'Cause you won't be home when
the hunter comes to call...</i>

31:18.668 --> 31:23.014
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper
would never track me down.

31:23.090 --> 31:26.390
Why, old Copper,
he's my best friend.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.391
Your best friend.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.939
Now, Copper's gonna do
what he's been told.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.018
Supposed to chase the little
old fox into the old foxhole,

31:34.101 --> 31:36.900
then along comes the hunter
with a buckshot load.

31:36.978 --> 31:40.573
- Ka-ka-ka-bam!
- Elimination.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.903
Lack of education.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.079
You better believe it, Tod.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.031
Yes, sirree!

31:48.115 --> 31:51.119
You mean Copper is
gonna be my enemy?

31:51.201 --> 31:52.794
Hey!

31:52.869 --> 31:56.794
Kid, you better step over
here and take a good look.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.343
Why... Why, that's awful.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.684
Those poor things.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.104
I'm sorry, Tod.

32:15.183 --> 32:20.110
Honey, Copper's gonna come
back a trained huntin' dog.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.691
A real killer.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.948
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.995
He won't ever change.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.324
I hope you're right, Tod.

32:30.407 --> 32:34.002
And we'll keep on being
friends forever.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.671
Um, won't we, Big Mama?

32:36.746 --> 32:41.673
Darlin', forever is
a long, long time,

32:41.751 --> 32:45.130
and time has a way
of changin' things.

33:48.610 --> 33:52.365
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.542
- I'm freezin' my b...
- Hey!

33:55.617 --> 33:58.541
It's that fuzzy worm!
Let's get him!

33:59.287 --> 34:00.755
Charge!

34:05.669 --> 34:08.547
Hey, Dinky! Dinky,
quick! Over here!

34:08.630 --> 34:10.553
I got him! I got him!

34:13.635 --> 34:17.685
Do I look like a worm?
That's who we're after.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.896
Come on!

34:25.272 --> 34:27.445
Look at that little creep,

34:27.524 --> 34:30.744
warm and cozy by the fire.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.197
Let me take a look.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.033
Now how do you like that guy?

34:36.116 --> 34:38.414
Snug as a bug,

34:39.452 --> 34:43.172
while we're out here freezin'
our b-b-b-beaks off.

34:43.248 --> 34:47.378
Well, yackin' and shiverin'
ain't gettin' us anywhere.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.840
We'll get that no-good
worm when we come back.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.514
Oh, sh-sh-sh-shucks.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.853
So long, Big Mama.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.811
Yeah, we're goin'
s-s-south for the winter.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.988
Goodbye, boys. See ya next spring.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.886
Well, look who's here.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.138
Oh, my goodness.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.642
I'm sorry, Tod, honey.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.774
- I hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.022
We're back. We flew all the way.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.024
Yeah, we did. We did.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.821
Welcome home, boys!

38:35.897 --> 38:39.777
It's been kind of lonesome around
here without you little rascals.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.495
Hi, fellas!

38:42.570 --> 38:44.368
Hey, who's that? Who's that?

38:44.447 --> 38:46.870
This can't be that
scrawny little squirt

38:46.950 --> 38:50.375
we found by the fence
post, can it? Come on.

38:50.453 --> 38:53.047
I... I can't believe my eyes.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.171
Oh, it's me, all right.

38:56.251 --> 39:00.176
Hey, looky there. He's got
himself a real fancy collar.

39:00.255 --> 39:04.761
Hey, hey, hey. Just
look at this bushy tail.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.062
Beautiful.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.602
Aw, come on. Cut it out. You
guys are always teasin' me.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.902
Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.953
We'll see ya later, kid.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.952
We gotta take care of
some unfinished business.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.623
I can't understand.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.956
It was so healthy.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.259
There. That oughta perk it up.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.564
Now, where'd he go? Where'd he go?

39:51.639 --> 39:55.064
He's goin' up the drainpipe!
I'll head him off.

39:55.143 --> 39:59.398
OK, Boomer, we got him
trapped! Let him have it!

40:05.987 --> 40:07.159
Aah!

40:09.616 --> 40:11.914
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.415
Neither did I.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.506
Come on! Look!

40:23.379 --> 40:27.475
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!

40:37.852 --> 40:40.275
- Holy!
- Smoke!

40:48.071 --> 40:51.826
Hey, hey, how's he do that,
Dinky? How's he do that?

40:58.915 --> 41:00.883
<i>I ain't got no job
I'm a huntin' man</i>

41:00.959 --> 41:02.961
<i>And I'd rather have
a dog than a dollar</i>

41:03.044 --> 41:06.048
<i>So let's go banjo
ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho</i>

41:06.130 --> 41:08.883
<i>Give a little hoot and a holler</i>

41:11.135 --> 41:13.479
Aw, come on, Chief.

41:13.554 --> 41:17.730
Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front,
that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.311
Shucks, if it weren't for you,

41:19.394 --> 41:22.318
Copper'd never have turned
into a good huntin' dog.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.275
Yes, sirree.

41:25.358 --> 41:29.079
Now I got me the best
two dogs there is.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.826
Right, Copper?

41:34.575 --> 41:36.498
Isn't he somethin', Chief?

41:48.089 --> 41:50.683
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!

41:52.427 --> 41:54.521
Boy, has he grown big.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.436
Uh-huh.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.564
And look at that big pile of
skins he helped track down.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.196
I know, Big Mama. He's
a huntin' dog now.

42:04.272 --> 42:07.401
You're right. And you're a fox.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.493
Ah, that won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.

42:12.572 --> 42:15.451
Well, honey, just don't
get your hopes too high.

42:15.533 --> 42:19.128
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.

42:19.203 --> 42:22.127
I'll go tonight when Chief
and the hunter are asleep.

42:30.882 --> 42:33.977
Boy, it's great to be back
home, isn't it, Chief?

42:37.388 --> 42:41.109
Aw, come on, Chief. You
aren't still sore, are ya?

42:41.184 --> 42:43.152
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.480
We ain't scuffled in a long time.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.112
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!

42:48.191 --> 42:52.162
Oh, lay off, Copper, you
overgrown pup, you.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.080
Oh, let go!

42:58.159 --> 43:00.002
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!

43:00.078 --> 43:02.206
Oh, OK, OK.

43:02.288 --> 43:04.211
That was your trouble on the hunt.

43:04.290 --> 43:07.009
Aw, come on, old-timer.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.338
You treat me like a
pup, you know that?

43:09.420 --> 43:12.799
Why, I think I done real good
trackin' down them varmints for ya.

43:12.882 --> 43:16.386
Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough.

43:16.469 --> 43:19.222
You gotta think nasty.

43:20.014 --> 43:23.109
OK, OK, I know.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.606
I know.

43:40.159 --> 43:42.127
Copper.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.126
Hey, Copper.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.503
It's me, Tod.

43:46.582 --> 43:50.507
I thought that was you,
Tod. I heard ya comin'.

43:50.586 --> 43:52.509
Boy, you've really grown.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.636
You have too, Copper.

43:54.715 --> 43:57.685
I saw you comin' back with
Chief and the hunter.

43:59.387 --> 44:02.015
It's great to see ya, Tod.

44:02.098 --> 44:05.477
But, you know, you...
You shouldn't be over here.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.188
You're gonna get us both
into a lot of trouble.

44:08.271 --> 44:11.650
Hey, look, I... I just
wanted to see ya.

44:11.732 --> 44:14.576
We're... We're still
friends, aren't we?

44:17.155 --> 44:20.534
Tod, those days are over.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.914
I'm... I'm a huntin' dog now.

44:30.418 --> 44:34.423
You'd better get outta here
before old Chief wakes up.

44:34.505 --> 44:38.430
Oh, Chief. He doesn't worry me.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.432
Tod, I'm serious. You're...

44:40.511 --> 44:43.435
You're fair game as far
as he's concerned.

44:48.811 --> 44:52.190
It's that fox again!

45:00.072 --> 45:01.915
Oh, no! No!

45:01.991 --> 45:03.914
They're after Tod!

45:03.993 --> 45:06.462
After him, boys! Go get him!

46:12.270 --> 46:13.692
Copper!

46:15.273 --> 46:17.116
Copper! Copper!

46:21.904 --> 46:23.622
Tod, I...

46:23.698 --> 46:26.167
I don't wanna see you get killed.

46:26.242 --> 46:28.119
Track him down, boy!

46:30.663 --> 46:33.132
I'll let you go this one time.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.890
Don't lose him!

46:57.690 --> 47:00.864
There they are! Old Chief's
got him on the run!

47:05.781 --> 47:07.499
Jump, Chief! Jump!

47:27.219 --> 47:29.893
Chief!

47:33.309 --> 47:34.777
Chief?

47:41.150 --> 47:43.027
Oh, no!

47:43.110 --> 47:44.703
No!

47:57.166 --> 48:00.511
Tod, if it's the last
thing I do, I'll...

48:00.586 --> 48:03.840
I'll get you for this!

48:10.888 --> 48:11.980
Tod!

48:12.723 --> 48:14.976
Tod? Tod!

48:18.187 --> 48:19.780
Oh, Tod!

48:19.855 --> 48:22.324
Thank heaven you're safe.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.217
Oh, poor Chief.

48:45.214 --> 48:47.182
And it's all my fault.

48:48.759 --> 48:51.182
I shouldn't have let Tod go.

48:58.727 --> 49:01.776
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!

49:01.856 --> 49:03.858
There's trouble!

49:15.244 --> 49:17.338
Tod! Well, what is it?

49:17.413 --> 49:19.882
What on earth?

49:21.584 --> 49:24.428
Widow, get out here!

49:24.503 --> 49:26.631
Why, Amos! What are you...?

49:26.714 --> 49:29.513
Where is he? Where is he?

49:29.592 --> 49:31.515
I know he's in there.

49:31.594 --> 49:33.346
Now just a minute.

49:33.429 --> 49:37.309
You can't come bargin' onto
my property, Amos Slade!

49:37.391 --> 49:40.520
That fox of yours
almost killed Chief,

49:40.603 --> 49:42.822
and I'm gonna get him!

49:43.856 --> 49:47.326
You can't keep him
locked up forever!

51:05.354 --> 51:07.823
<i>We met, it seems</i>

51:07.898 --> 51:10.151
<i>Such a short time ago</i>

51:11.652 --> 51:14.872
<i>You looked at me</i>

51:14.947 --> 51:16.915
<i>Needing me so</i>

51:18.284 --> 51:21.538
<i>Yet from your sadness</i>

51:21.620 --> 51:24.544
<i>Our happiness grew</i>

51:24.623 --> 51:28.844
<i>And I found out I needed you too</i>

51:30.629 --> 51:34.930
<i>I remember how we used to play</i>

51:38.178 --> 51:42.433
<i>I recall those rainy days</i>

51:44.184 --> 51:47.233
<i>The fire's glow</i>

51:47.313 --> 51:49.657
<i>That kept us warm</i>

51:52.234 --> 51:54.862
<i>And now I find</i>

51:54.945 --> 51:57.448
<i>We're both alone</i>

51:57.531 --> 52:01.536
<i>Goodbye may seem forever</i>

52:01.619 --> 52:04.919
<i>Farewell is like the end</i>

52:06.540 --> 52:09.510
<i>But in my heart's the memory</i>

52:10.836 --> 52:15.637
<i>And there... you'll always be</i>

53:08.060 --> 53:12.941
<i>Goodbye may seem forever</i>

53:13.023 --> 53:16.948
<i>Farewell is like the end</i>

53:17.027 --> 53:21.578
<i>But in my heart's the</i> memory

53:21.657 --> 53:27.289
<i>And there you'll always be</i>

55:05.928 --> 55:08.181
Hold it, sonny! Back off!

55:08.263 --> 55:11.733
Consarn it! Where...? Where
do you think you're goin'?

55:11.809 --> 55:15.063
Oh, oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...

55:15.145 --> 55:18.069
You barge in on somebody's
house like you own it.

55:18.148 --> 55:20.116
Tarryhootin' around them woods,

55:20.192 --> 55:23.116
wakin' up folks in the
middle of the night.

55:23.195 --> 55:27.120
I honestly didn't know
anybody lived here, and I...

55:27.199 --> 55:30.294
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!

55:30.369 --> 55:32.167
Go on! Beat it!

55:34.832 --> 55:38.553
I've been watching you, sir. You
can stay with me if you want to.

55:38.627 --> 55:41.847
- That's very nice of you.
- Come with me.

56:07.489 --> 56:11.084
She dropped that fox off
at the game preserve.

56:11.159 --> 56:14.129
We'll get him. We'll get him.

56:32.806 --> 56:35.776
Well, now, if you gotta
have a busted leg,

56:35.851 --> 56:38.104
ah, this is the way to do it.

56:38.186 --> 56:42.032
Good food, soft pillow,

56:42.107 --> 56:44.451
warm stove.

56:44.526 --> 56:46.779
Sure beats sleepin' in that barrel.

56:51.658 --> 56:56.380
Well, now, here comes
visitors to see the invalid.

57:06.840 --> 57:11.220
How do you like that? They
didn't even ask how I'm feelin'.

57:18.894 --> 57:23.274
Chief, get back in there
before I break your other leg.

57:26.902 --> 57:29.701
Copper, Copper, lookit here.

57:32.157 --> 57:35.661
Now, when that fox
comes traipsin' along,

57:35.744 --> 57:37.712
suspectin' nothin'...

57:54.638 --> 57:56.060
Tod?

57:57.224 --> 57:58.567
Tod?

58:01.269 --> 58:05.115
Oh, boy. These old wings
ain't what they used to be.

58:07.442 --> 58:11.367
Big Mama, you better
lose a few pounds.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.324
Uh-oh, uh-oh, there
he is, there he is.

58:15.450 --> 58:16.747
Tod!

58:18.036 --> 58:19.754
Tod!

58:19.830 --> 58:21.753
Oh, hi, Big Mama.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.709
Oh, it's you, Vixey.

58:23.792 --> 58:25.715
Hey, what brings you way out here?

58:25.794 --> 58:28.468
I'm lookin' for a fox named Tod.

58:28.547 --> 58:32.393
- He's new here in the forest.
- Oh, new? Um...

58:32.467 --> 58:35.186
Well, what does he look like?

58:35.262 --> 58:39.608
Oh, he's young. About your age.

58:40.767 --> 58:42.189
And handsome.

58:42.269 --> 58:45.273
Handsome? Oh, say.

58:45.355 --> 58:48.404
Gee, uh, he sure sounds nice.

58:48.483 --> 58:51.111
Uh, I'm not doing anything.

58:51.194 --> 58:53.196
I'll help you find him.

58:54.281 --> 58:56.909
Come on. He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

59:20.390 --> 59:21.892
Wham?

59:21.975 --> 59:24.478
What happened? Where am I?

59:39.493 --> 59:42.542
So, it's you again, hmm?

59:42.621 --> 59:45.249
You barged in on me last
night, and now you...

59:45.332 --> 59:46.424
I... I didn't mean to.

59:46.500 --> 59:50.300
Just look at the... mess you made.

59:53.173 --> 59:56.347
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!

59:56.426 --> 59:58.474
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.555
Excuses, excuses.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:03.358
Mr. Digger, sir? It was
so too an accident.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.312
You keep out of this,
you walkin' pincushion.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:11.317
You shouldn't be so grumpy to
someone who's new in the neighborhood.

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.948
A stranger, eh?

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.655
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:19.620
Wham?

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:27.966
Well, go on.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.294
Get goin'. Git!

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.361
Aww.

01:00:56.444 --> 01:01:00.745
Gosh, he seems so... I don't
know, so downhearted, Big Mama.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.203
Well, you can't blame him, honey.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:08.416
He was dropped out here and left all
alone without a friend in the world.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.796
Well, maybe there's
something I could do.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.844
You know, cheer him up.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:16.469
Honey, you just said
the magic words.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.934
Now...

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:27.268
What? But Big Mama, I don't...

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:31.196
Darlin', don't move.
You look beautiful.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.693
Thank you.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.490
Mornin', Tod.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.369
Hello, Big Mama.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.994
Last night was pretty miserable
for you, wasn't it, honey?

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.369
Just terrible.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:45.749
Cheer up and look around.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.501
The forest is beautiful
this morning.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.584
After last night, nothin'
looks beautiful.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.718
Wow!

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:01.100
Who...? Who is that?

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:03.804
Oh, just another fox.

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:07.937
A lady fox.

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:09.643
Golly!

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:12.779
Is she beautiful!

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:16.279
I wonder what her name is.

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:20.613
Well, why don't you go ask her?

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:24.700
Yeah. Yeah, guess... Guess I will.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:29.914
I'll... I'll go up to her and I'll
say, "You're the most gorgeous...

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.715
The most beautiful...

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:38.256
Never seen anyone,
anywhere..." I'll say...

01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:41.845
Hi.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:43.806
Hello.

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:46.764
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:51.693
May I call you by your first name?

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:55.193
Oh. Sure. Why not?

01:02:56.439 --> 01:03:00.160
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:02.658
- Vixey.
- Vixey.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:04.159
Uh-huh.

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:08.164
My name is... is... uh, Tod.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.961
Tod?

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:15.171
That's a... That's
a nice name, Tod.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.595
It looks like that farm boy is
makin' it b-b-big with her.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.674
Shh! Now just keep it down.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.384
Well, Tod, you know something?

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.845
This stream is just full of trout.

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:29.101
Do you think you could catch one?

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.026
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:35.354
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:38.611
My dear young lady...

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:43.829
you happen to be looking
at an expert... fisher fox.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:47.874
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:52.204
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.665
Please let him catch a fish.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:57.467
Here comes a whopper!

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:59.886
Now, watch closely.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.104
Tod, do you need help?

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:15.186
No. No, I... I do it this way

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:17.691
all... all the... all the time!

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.943
I got him.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:27.702
Oh, that farm boy, he don't
know nothin' about f-f-fishin'.

01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:29.954
He ain't gonna hook her that way.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.035
Oh, gosh!

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:36.168
Tod, you're the funniest
thing I ever saw!

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:40.218
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.921
You're like everyone
else around here.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:48.014
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:51.188
So I can't fish!

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:53.230
You're a silly,

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:56.560
empty-headed... female!

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.020
Now just a minute.

01:04:58.103 --> 01:05:00.947
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:06.073
Tod, that's no way
to talk to Vixey.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:10.453
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:12.829
Honey, don't stay mad.

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:18.293
You gotta be natural. That's
the trick. Can't you see?

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:23.630
<i>When you have a natural attraction</i>

01:05:23.632 --> 01:05:29.309
<i>You deserve a mutual reaction</i>

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:32.137
<i>You're gonna get a whole lot</i>

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.349
<i>Of satisfaction</i>

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:40.487
<i>Here's all you gotta do</i>

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.485
<i>When you feel that</i>

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:47.161
<i>Natural affection</i>

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:52.207
<i>Leads you in the positive direction</i>

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:55.331
<i>You gotta stop showin' off</i>

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.788
<i>Start showin' up</i>

01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:01.717
<i>With little old natural you</i>

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:08.219
<i>Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady</i>

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:13.725
<i>And now that is a natural fact</i>

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:18.892
<i>'Cause when you be yourself</i>

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:23.863
<i>With the lady, yeah</i>

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:29.991
<i>You gonna get appreciated</i>

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:32.948
<i>Right back</i>

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:45.927
Shh.

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:49.928
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:03.315
Tod, I...

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:06.568
I just know you're
gonna love the forest.

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:08.992
Listen, come on. Let
me show you around.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.694
Sure.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.033
Come on.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:31.472
Look. One, two, three,
four, five, six.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.219
Seven.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:41.183
I think six would be just right.

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:43.519
Six?

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.736
Six what?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.488
"No hunting."

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:37.868
Well, now, we ain't gonna do
none of that, are we, Copper?

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:41.542
We're just gonna get
us a no-good fox.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.461
All right, boy, get trackin'.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.167
Smell him out.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:55.108
What ya got there, Copper?

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.572
Good work, boy.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.909
He'll be comin' right through
here, headin' for water.

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:06.961
But he won't be drinkin' any.

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:22.427
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:24.808
You know, I've never been happier.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.981
Oh, Tod, me too.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.661
That does it.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.159
Amos, you crafty old coot.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.539
The devil himself couldn't
have done no better.

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:53.750
Tod?

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.086
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:59.423
I don't wanna go in
there. It's too quiet.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.348
Oh, Vixey.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.225
What?

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:14.942
Tod, be careful.

01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:01.530
Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!

01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:03.407
Quick, Vixey!

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:12.120
Go on, head for the burrow.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:51.284
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:58.583
Tod!

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.599
Oh, no, Tod.

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:27.737
Cooper! Copper!

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.996
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:35.169
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.292
Tod!

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:39.123
We're trapped!

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:45.384
Tod, I'm scared.

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:48.763
Quick, Vixey! This
is our only chance!

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:52.520
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!

01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:41.895
Copper, we've trapped him now!

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.088
Ow!

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.222
Copper!

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.968
Tod!

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.888
Tod?

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:20.868
Come on, Copper. Get outta the way.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.164
Well...

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:07.205
come on, boy.

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:09.412
Let's go home.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.410
Shh, Shh. This is it.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.491
We got him for sure now.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:34.163
Oh, my g-g-gosh!

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.248
- Whoa!
- Yoww!

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.716
What happened?

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:43.509
Hey, there's somethin'

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:47.560
very familiar about
those eyes, Dinky.

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:53.683
Nah, it couldn't be.

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:57.107
Could it?

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.159
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:09.160
Good luck, honey.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:20.093
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:24.464
Amos Slade, will you hold still?

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.389
You're behaving like a child.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:29.765
Well, for gosh sakes, you're
hurtin' my foot, woman!

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:33.598
- Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.
- Ow!

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.603
You'll soon be yourself.

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:39.653
Oh, land sakes. I don't
know if I like that.

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:45.613
Ow! Be careful! Ouch!

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:50.823
He's sure makin' a big fuss
over a little old hurt leg.

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:09.516
<i>Copper?</i>

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:14.271
<i>You're my very best friend.</i>

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:16.565
<i>And you're mine too, Tod.</i>

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.736
<i>And we'll always be friends
forever, won't we?</i>

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:22.654
<i>Yeah, forever.</i>
