00:02.172 --> 00:03.517
male narrator: Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:03.517 --> 00:05.241
- What is your name, darling?
- Jamie.

00:05.241 --> 00:06.689
I drove from Chicago
just for these tryouts.

00:06.689 --> 00:08.551
- I'm just a whore
that took down a mega-church.

00:08.551 --> 00:12.413
You were the
best choreographer working.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.241
That's what you were famous
for, that's who I came to see.

00:14.241 --> 00:16.896
- I'm no pushover.
- I'm no pushover, either.

00:16.896 --> 00:20.172
- I'm a rookie.
This is $20,000.

00:20.172 --> 00:22.172
- I thought you could use it.

00:22.172 --> 00:24.344
- Jude, you need to shake
yourself out of it.

00:24.344 --> 00:26.344
- I'm the new sideline reporter
for ISN.

00:26.344 --> 00:28.931
- I'm the executive vice
president of the team.

00:28.931 --> 00:31.275
- You lost your wife
and you lost your job.

00:31.275 --> 00:33.172
Come back to the Devils.

00:33.172 --> 00:34.620
- Does he know about the coke?

00:34.620 --> 00:36.896
- If you take away my alibi,
I'm underwater.

00:36.896 --> 00:38.172
- Drown, bitch.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.793
- You want to adopt me?
- Yeah.

00:40.793 --> 00:42.862
- I can't believe what Raquel
did for me.

00:42.862 --> 00:44.965
- German Vega didn't kill
Olivia.

00:44.965 --> 00:46.379
I did.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.758
- Eve Vincent. I'm Olivia
and Chase's daughter.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.862
- Is this Pete Davenport?

00:50.862 --> 00:53.275
His blood alcohol was .28.

00:53.275 --> 00:56.551
- When I'm done,
there won't be a Devils left.

01:12.896 --> 01:14.482
- London. London, where have
you been?

01:14.482 --> 01:16.000
What have you been doing?
- London, what's it's like

01:16.000 --> 01:17.413
being in the public eye again?

01:17.413 --> 01:18.931
- What do you have to say
about Pastor Curtis?

01:18.931 --> 01:20.758
- Are you still
in love with him, London?

01:20.758 --> 01:23.448
- Will you use any of the moves
on court that got him into bed?

01:23.448 --> 01:24.689
- Have you spoken
to him since he gave

01:24.689 --> 01:26.310
that interview with his wife?

01:26.310 --> 01:27.965
- London, just one comment
about Pastor Curtis, please.

01:27.965 --> 01:29.344
- Get back, you vultures.

01:29.344 --> 01:31.793
Y'all should be ashamed
of yourselves.

01:36.034 --> 01:39.103
How you holding up?
- Great. Fine.

01:39.103 --> 01:41.517
Never been better.

01:42.862 --> 01:45.000
Are you sure about this?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.413
Having me on your team,

01:47.413 --> 01:48.965
all the baggage
that I come with.

01:48.965 --> 01:50.793
- I don't make bad decisions.

01:50.793 --> 01:53.172
You're our choreographer
whether you like it or not.

01:53.172 --> 01:56.344
And you got a big opening game
dance to focus on,

01:56.344 --> 01:58.793
so you better shake
this off real quick.

02:01.206 --> 02:03.517
- I never thought I'd be back.

02:03.517 --> 02:05.551
Not that I had anywhere else
to go.

02:05.551 --> 02:08.103
Thank you.
- Opening game is a sellout.

02:08.103 --> 02:10.241
I got what I paid for.

02:12.931 --> 02:14.586
- Derek.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.551
- Perfect.

02:26.034 --> 02:28.137
- How could you bring him back?

02:28.137 --> 02:29.517
He's unpredictable.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.310
- Is your issue
that he's unpredictable

02:31.310 --> 02:33.103
or that he doesn't like you?

02:33.103 --> 02:34.758
Why I have yet to figure out.

02:34.758 --> 02:36.965
- He thinks I stabbed him in
the back once.

02:36.965 --> 02:38.413
- Did you?

02:40.379 --> 02:43.344
- My issue is
he's self-destructive,

02:43.344 --> 02:45.689
and I don't want him pulling
us down with him.

02:45.689 --> 02:50.655
- Don't worry,
I'm a creative problem solver.

02:57.689 --> 02:59.724
- German?

02:59.724 --> 03:01.931
- Hey, Derek.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.068
- You come to flash your new
championship ring in our faces?

03:04.068 --> 03:07.034
- Hey, Boston's been good to me,

03:07.034 --> 03:08.344
in more ways than one.

03:08.344 --> 03:10.413
They cancelled
my assistant coach contract.

03:10.413 --> 03:11.896
- How is that good?

03:11.896 --> 03:15.034
- So I can sign
my first head coach contract.

03:15.034 --> 03:17.275
Here.

03:17.862 --> 03:19.379
- You're the--

03:19.379 --> 03:21.586
- Let's start running drills,
fellas.

03:21.586 --> 03:23.310
Let's go.

03:28.724 --> 03:30.517
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
the call either.

03:30.517 --> 03:32.206
But I was happy to get it.

03:32.206 --> 03:33.793
- I mean, don't--don't
get me wrong.

03:33.793 --> 03:35.931
I mean, I know you're off
conquering the world now.

03:35.931 --> 03:39.413
I mean, shit, you got more
rings than I do, but...

03:39.413 --> 03:42.137
I mean, here?
With me?

03:42.137 --> 03:45.379
- Look, man, Jelana's
a lot of things,

03:45.379 --> 03:47.275
but stupid isn't one of them.

03:47.275 --> 03:50.620
I mean she saw the way
I turned my life around.

03:50.620 --> 03:53.724
Maybe she thought I could help
you turn your life around too.

03:53.724 --> 03:56.379
- Look, man, my life is fine.

03:56.379 --> 03:58.103
- You know, another coach
might not

03:58.103 --> 04:00.620
know how big of a lie that is.

04:00.620 --> 04:03.724
One that hasn't been hit by
the same hurricane you have.

04:05.689 --> 04:09.517
Look, man, I know things got
pretty crazy for you in Miami.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.655
The fights, the parties,
all of it.

04:11.655 --> 04:17.034
- Any beef you and I had
is in the past.

04:17.034 --> 04:18.379
So is any of
that foolery in Miami.

04:18.379 --> 04:20.689
That was just me
blowing off steam.

04:20.689 --> 04:22.620
I am cool.

04:23.620 --> 04:27.310
- Okay. Cool.
I'll see you out there.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.517
- I will see you out there.

04:41.517 --> 04:42.689
- Hi.

04:42.689 --> 04:44.068
Got a minute?

04:44.068 --> 04:47.586
- Not unless it involves you
making sweet, sweet, love.

04:47.586 --> 04:49.896
And I don't mean to yourself.

04:53.931 --> 04:55.827
Jude.

04:55.827 --> 04:57.931
- It was with
your new sideline reporter.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.034
- Jude.
- I know.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.000
I had no idea.
Awkward, right?

05:02.000 --> 05:06.931
So I was hoping
you could maybe, you know...

05:06.931 --> 05:08.275
shift him.
- Shift him?

05:08.275 --> 05:10.896
- To another arena.

05:10.896 --> 05:12.655
No.
- No?

05:12.655 --> 05:15.206
- Last season was a bust thanks
to your Devils.

05:15.206 --> 05:16.620
Stock in
sleeping pills plummeted

05:16.620 --> 05:18.310
and so did my viewership.

05:18.310 --> 05:19.896
I need to wake people up
this season.

05:19.896 --> 05:21.586
Noah will do that.

05:21.586 --> 05:24.000
He's got a big mouth and an
even bigger online following.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.344
- Has he been on TV before?

05:25.344 --> 05:28.034
- If Carson Daly can do it,
anybody can.

05:28.034 --> 05:30.241
- Well, Lionel--

05:30.241 --> 05:31.758
- You made your bed.

05:31.758 --> 05:34.689
Now you're trying to kick
your little tramp out of it.

05:34.689 --> 05:38.482
Be careful Jude,
your Kinkade is showing.

05:44.965 --> 05:47.241
- Whose locker is that?

05:47.241 --> 05:49.275
- That's mine,
I have a lot of stuff.

05:49.275 --> 05:51.724
- You might as well
just move in.

05:51.724 --> 05:54.586
- Six different gossip sites
just off this morning alone.

05:54.586 --> 05:56.689
Jelana's gonna love this.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.896
- Well, you put yourself
front and center.

06:03.758 --> 06:06.586
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot.

06:06.586 --> 06:07.862
'Kay, we're both new here.

06:07.862 --> 06:09.241
We should have
each other's backs.

06:09.241 --> 06:11.586
- Yeah, we should.

06:11.586 --> 06:13.965
- You're competition, okay?

06:13.965 --> 06:18.896
I was stankface because
you're you and I'm me, and...

06:18.896 --> 06:20.655
I didn't come here
to be Kelly Rowland.

06:20.655 --> 06:22.896
- Kelly Rowland's
a great friend of mine.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.793
- Okay.

06:27.793 --> 06:30.689
Maybe I got a little fancy
in the dance.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.758
I get it.

06:32.758 --> 06:35.724
So if you got my back,
I've got yours.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.758
- Cool.
- Mm-kay.

06:42.689 --> 06:45.793
- Oh, hey! Heard you tried
to get me fired.

06:45.793 --> 06:47.655
- What? No.

06:47.655 --> 06:50.241
No I wouldn't--
- I get it.

06:50.241 --> 06:52.034
You're up here.
I'm down here.

06:52.034 --> 06:55.931
- You're not down here.
- I was that night.

06:56.689 --> 06:58.137
I can handle being
under the same roof.

06:58.137 --> 07:00.620
Clearly you can't.
- Look, I can handle it, okay?

07:00.620 --> 07:02.689
I can handle anything.
I'm a handler.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.620
- Good. Then we won't
have any problems.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.689
- Nope.
- Later, pal.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.448
- The jersey retirement
is scheduled before the game.

07:18.448 --> 07:19.758
- That's a mock-up
of the program.

07:19.758 --> 07:21.482
Every fan will get one.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.896
- The league will pay for it.
All of it.

07:23.896 --> 07:26.620
Including the entire ceremony.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.758
- You don't have to do that.

07:27.758 --> 07:29.896
- It's the commissioner's idea.

07:29.896 --> 07:31.862
Not mine.

07:32.931 --> 07:34.896
- Eve.

07:34.896 --> 07:38.137
I think we should clear
the air about a few things.

07:38.137 --> 07:40.655
- I don't need to be handled.

07:40.655 --> 07:42.896
You're a piece of work.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.172
So was my mother.
You didn't get along.

07:46.172 --> 07:48.413
Life goes on.

07:48.413 --> 07:50.793
S'okay.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.103
- Okay.

07:55.689 --> 07:57.620
- You have a call.
- Take a message.

07:57.620 --> 07:59.827
- It's your adoption lawyer.

08:05.344 --> 08:08.586
- Robert, what's going on?

08:08.586 --> 08:10.310
No, his father
already signed it.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.034
There's no problem.

08:14.206 --> 08:15.758
When?

08:15.758 --> 08:18.620
I don't care about
Jesse Reed's rights.

08:18.620 --> 08:21.620
That man never wanted Miguel.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.931
How could he just
change his mind?

08:23.931 --> 08:26.758
Why would he suddenly do this?

08:35.586 --> 08:37.724
- Lionel Kinkade.

08:37.724 --> 08:39.758
- Davenport.
- Eve Vincent.

08:39.758 --> 08:42.793
I work for
Commissioner Matthews.

08:42.793 --> 08:44.758
- Olivia and Chase's daughter.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.655
- You're doing
a great job with ISN.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.275
It's great to see
a woman in charge,

08:48.275 --> 08:49.655
kicking ass.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.241
- There's a couple
of those around here.

08:51.241 --> 08:55.068
- I was just with Jelana.
She was getting hers kicked.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.551
- What do you mean?

08:56.551 --> 08:59.586
- Miguel's father had a change
of heart on custody.

08:59.586 --> 09:01.758
Apparently someone called
him in Australia

09:01.758 --> 09:04.379
and got him all fired up about
Jelena Howard being

09:04.379 --> 09:06.000
the one to raise him.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.068
- Who would do that?

09:07.068 --> 09:09.896
- Given her reputation,
who wouldn't?

09:09.896 --> 09:11.310
- Well,
from what I heard,

09:11.310 --> 09:13.482
Jesse wasn't
a gold star parent.

09:13.482 --> 09:15.517
- From what I know,
neither was his mother.

09:15.517 --> 09:16.931
Raquel Saldana confessed

09:16.931 --> 09:19.758
to doing something pretty awful
to my mother.

09:19.758 --> 09:22.965
I don't take joy
in seeing her son suffer,

09:22.965 --> 09:26.206
but I can't
give sympathy either.

09:26.206 --> 09:29.103
- He's been Jelena's life for
the past year and a half.

09:29.103 --> 09:31.931
I can't imagine what
this will do to her.

09:31.931 --> 09:33.275
- Or the Devils.

09:33.275 --> 09:38.172
When an owner takes a hit,
the entire team can spiral.

09:38.172 --> 09:41.275
I'd hate to see that happen.

09:41.275 --> 09:45.551
You know, I'm new here.
I could use a lay of the land,

09:45.551 --> 09:47.655
figure out how I can help.

09:47.655 --> 09:51.206
You're connected to everyone.
Drinks sometime?

09:51.206 --> 09:53.517
On the League?

09:53.517 --> 09:56.275
- I'll check my schedule.

09:59.448 --> 10:01.793
- Hail Derek Roman!

10:01.793 --> 10:04.620
The Emperor has returned,
y'all.

10:07.793 --> 10:10.827
- Man, when I got called up

10:10.827 --> 10:13.413
by LA, my mind was blown.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.896
Playing in the pros.

10:14.896 --> 10:17.517
I had no idea Derek Roman
was gonna be on the team.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.965
- Neither did Derek Roman.

10:18.965 --> 10:21.827
- Top rebounder in the league
three years in a row.

10:21.827 --> 10:24.620
Four time all-star.
Your favorite artist is Tupac,

10:24.620 --> 10:27.448
and your favorite color,
money.

10:27.448 --> 10:29.931
- What's my favorite drink?

10:29.931 --> 10:31.896
- Jack Silver.

10:37.413 --> 10:39.482
You got it.

10:49.172 --> 10:52.758
- Hello, I didn't
know anyone was in here.

10:52.758 --> 10:54.931
In my bedroom, naked.

10:54.931 --> 10:56.758
- Just changing into
a bathing suit.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.724
- Don't let me stop you.

11:00.448 --> 11:02.517
You a rookie?

11:02.517 --> 11:04.896
- Yeah, fresh and new
and out of the box.

11:04.896 --> 11:06.724
- Okay,
From where?

11:06.724 --> 11:08.793
- Chicago.
- Yeah, that's where I'm from.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.724
- I know.
Any advice for a noobie?

11:11.724 --> 11:15.034
- I was an absolute mess
my first few seasons.

11:15.034 --> 11:16.724
- Hmm.

11:16.724 --> 11:20.000
Till your wife cleaned you up.
- Ex-wife.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.344
- Well, her loss,
someone else's gain

11:26.620 --> 11:29.965
Thanks for the chat,
and by the way,

11:29.965 --> 11:32.275
I knew you were watching
the whole time.

11:39.275 --> 11:42.586
What's that?

11:42.586 --> 11:45.965
Jack Silver.
- My favorite.

11:52.482 --> 11:55.275
- Where's my drink?

11:56.620 --> 11:59.000
- I was just about to get it.

12:01.241 --> 12:03.551
- Hey, rook,
I dinged your Maserati, bro.

12:03.551 --> 12:06.103
It's fine,
you got insurance, right?

12:07.172 --> 12:09.103
- Mary Beth, I'll just hold
onto this and your keys

12:09.103 --> 12:12.000
until we can find someone
to drive your drunk ass home.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.034
How's it going, darling?

12:15.034 --> 12:17.448
- Uh...
king of the world.

12:17.448 --> 12:19.793
- Or?

12:19.793 --> 12:22.137
- Or I feel like the help
and I'm lucky to be here.

12:22.137 --> 12:24.000
- You're a Devil.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.758
Vodka stinger,
straight up with a twist.

12:29.931 --> 12:32.655
- Yeah, I bought a car
I can't afford to put gas in,

12:32.655 --> 12:34.241
clothes I can't afford
to dry clean,

12:34.241 --> 12:36.689
and a watch I can't afford
a battery for.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.896
How can you be
a big baller without

12:37.896 --> 12:39.103
a big baller bank account?

12:39.103 --> 12:40.310
- Story of my life.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.137
Jelena only just gave me
the chance to score off

12:42.137 --> 12:44.965
the dancers, if they don't
blow it for me first.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.758
Maggie, get down off that.

12:46.758 --> 12:49.034
That is not a swing.

12:49.034 --> 12:52.724
Oh, wait, it is a swing.
Get down anyway!

13:12.758 --> 13:15.206
- This party's invite only,
son.

13:15.206 --> 13:16.862
Who you here with?

13:16.862 --> 13:19.172
- John.
- There's no John here, man.

13:19.172 --> 13:20.586
- How could there be no
John here?

13:20.586 --> 13:22.137
Every party has a John.

13:22.137 --> 13:24.103
- He's my date.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.758
- Mm-hmm.

13:28.827 --> 13:31.241
- You didn't have to do that.
- I did.

13:31.241 --> 13:35.620
I'm not a fan of people being
told they don't belong.

13:35.620 --> 13:39.965
You're the internet guy.
You work for ISN.

13:39.965 --> 13:42.068
- I'm off duty.
- Hmm.

13:42.068 --> 13:45.000
Too bad, there's no
time like camera time.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.586
- You're a Devil girl,
like London.

13:47.586 --> 13:51.068
- No.
Like Jamie.

13:56.275 --> 13:58.034
- What's your story?

13:58.034 --> 14:00.862
- I don't have one.
Yet.

14:00.862 --> 14:03.620
But, by the end
of the season...

14:03.620 --> 14:05.206
you'll know my name.

14:05.206 --> 14:07.586
- Can I quote you on that?
- Thought you were off duty?

14:07.586 --> 14:09.827
- I'm never off duty.

14:09.827 --> 14:12.275
- Well,
off the record, it's...

14:12.275 --> 14:13.793
hard to break through
when the press

14:13.793 --> 14:15.275
is breaking down
the door for London.

14:15.275 --> 14:18.448
- You're just gonna have
to break down your own.

14:23.827 --> 14:26.241
- Those things'll kill you.

14:28.551 --> 14:31.103
- So's hiding in here
when the party's out there.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.689
- Well...

14:32.689 --> 14:35.000
Kyle tricked me
into coming here.

14:35.965 --> 14:38.275
She said she wanted
to go over some steps.

14:38.275 --> 14:40.413
And plus, I've been
photographed enough for today.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.724
- Hey, about that,
I wanted to say thank you.

14:42.724 --> 14:43.931
I mean, you had
the paparazzi

14:43.931 --> 14:45.241
all whipped up
at the front door.

14:45.241 --> 14:47.620
I was able to just slide
through the side.

14:48.965 --> 14:50.448
- Well, thank you for
the rescue.

14:50.448 --> 14:51.724
You're such a gentleman.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.965
- No one ever said I was
a gentleman.

14:53.965 --> 14:55.965
- I know all about you.

14:55.965 --> 14:58.448
- Don't believe everything
you hear.

14:58.448 --> 15:01.620
- I couldn't agree more.

15:01.620 --> 15:04.137
So...
you got a great place,

15:04.137 --> 15:06.068
and a big game tomorrow.

15:06.068 --> 15:10.000
- Yeah, it is game 600
and whatever of my career.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
- But it's not, really.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.241
Look, this ain't
my first dance either,

15:15.241 --> 15:17.620
I've choreographed a thousand.

15:17.620 --> 15:19.482
But every time we go out there,

15:19.482 --> 15:23.275
it's like we got to prove
ourselves all over again.

15:23.275 --> 15:26.379
- One day you're a god
and the next...

15:26.379 --> 15:28.896
no--no one understands
what we go through.

15:28.896 --> 15:31.379
- We don't even understand
what we go through.

15:33.241 --> 15:35.655
You scared?

15:35.655 --> 15:38.000
- Terrified.

15:43.758 --> 15:45.275
- Well, that's why they call
them loopholes.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.724
You have to find them.
Look harder.

15:47.724 --> 15:50.172
I have to go.

15:52.896 --> 15:56.103
- Is everything okay?

15:56.103 --> 16:00.068
- Yeah, everything's fine.
Go back to bed.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.034
Go.

16:16.827 --> 16:18.620
- No, Kyle, you stay and party.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.517
I had to go because
I have a dance in the morning

16:20.517 --> 16:22.344
and I need to make sure I have
a quiet night.

16:22.344 --> 16:23.931
Okay?
Bye.

16:23.931 --> 16:26.344
- London.

16:26.344 --> 16:28.344
- Curtis,
what are you doing here?

16:28.344 --> 16:31.172
- Invite me in?
- No, I will not invite you in.

16:31.172 --> 16:34.379
- What if I told you I left?
- The church?

16:34.379 --> 16:36.034
- My wife.

16:36.034 --> 16:37.827
- You promised me
that the entire time

16:37.827 --> 16:39.103
we were together.
Why now?

16:39.103 --> 16:40.965
- 'Cause I don't love her.

16:40.965 --> 16:43.517
London, I love you.

16:43.517 --> 16:45.586
- Just...

16:47.827 --> 16:49.172
You said you loved me before

16:49.172 --> 16:50.862
and that didn't
make a difference.

16:50.862 --> 16:52.482
- I made some bad decisions.

16:52.482 --> 16:54.793
But you gotta admit this whole
situation was crazy.

16:54.793 --> 16:56.620
Look, forget all that.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.758
You and me can be together now.

16:58.758 --> 17:01.724
I believe that.
Away from here.

17:01.724 --> 17:04.241
- Away?
- Yeah.

17:04.241 --> 17:08.793
London, I came
to make things right.

17:08.793 --> 17:12.172
You and me are what's right.

17:12.172 --> 17:14.586
Baby, come away with me.

17:20.103 --> 17:23.103
- It was because
of Oscar Kinkade

17:23.103 --> 17:25.896
my parents kept me so far away.

17:25.896 --> 17:27.793
- I don't blame them.

17:27.793 --> 17:30.379
- But you're best friends
with his son.

17:30.379 --> 17:33.517
- I don't remember telling you
about my friendship with Jude.

17:35.379 --> 17:36.965
- I'm a researcher.

17:36.965 --> 17:39.137
- I'm not a fan
of being researched.

17:40.379 --> 17:41.862
Your turn.

17:41.862 --> 17:44.310
What made you want
to work for the League?

17:44.310 --> 17:47.379
- There are things
my mother and father worked for

17:47.379 --> 17:49.310
that didn't turn out
the way they should have.

17:49.310 --> 17:54.275
With the power of the League
I'll be able to correct that.

17:54.275 --> 17:56.689
- It must have
been tough growing up

17:56.689 --> 17:58.241
so far away from home.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.275
- Hmm.

18:01.275 --> 18:04.758
Closeness is just
a state of mind.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.172
That's from one of my movies.
- "Ecstasy."

18:10.172 --> 18:12.000
- So you're the one
that bought that ticket.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.034
- Illegally downloaded it.

18:15.034 --> 18:18.689
I must have watched
that one scene 20 times.

18:18.689 --> 18:21.172
So sexy.

18:21.172 --> 18:24.241
- He was a pill.
- I meant the woman.

18:27.137 --> 18:29.137
- 20 times is a lot.

18:29.137 --> 18:32.689
- I told you,
I'm a researcher.

18:41.379 --> 18:43.000
- Uh...

18:43.000 --> 18:46.793
Sorry, wrong room.
- No.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.310
Come in.

18:49.310 --> 18:51.965
Karla is a friend of mine.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.551
She told me about
the fun you had here.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.862
How gifted you are.

18:56.862 --> 18:58.517
- Look, I don't know
what she told you,

18:58.517 --> 19:00.827
but what happened here--
- She paid you.

19:00.827 --> 19:04.379
- Was an accident.
- And?

19:10.862 --> 19:13.448
- And how much
are we talking about here?

19:13.448 --> 19:15.965
- I heard about your endowment.

19:15.965 --> 19:18.862
Let's just say mine will match.

19:18.862 --> 19:20.724
But of course...

19:20.724 --> 19:23.103
It's up to you.

19:34.103 --> 19:36.517
- Derek.
Couldn't find my invite.

19:36.517 --> 19:38.344
- I ran out
of spit for my stamps.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.137
- What the hell
are you doing throwing a party

19:40.137 --> 19:42.206
the night before
the first game of the season?

19:42.206 --> 19:44.172
- Don't worry about me.
- I don't care about you.

19:44.172 --> 19:46.137
I care about every other player
that should be home

19:46.137 --> 19:47.551
that you lured here.

19:47.551 --> 19:50.551
- I can't help it if people
want to be around me.

19:52.413 --> 19:54.448
- If you're not
gonna work with me,

19:54.448 --> 19:57.068
at least don't work against me.

19:57.068 --> 19:59.965
- I don't work for you period.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.448
You are not the coach.
You're not the owner.

20:03.448 --> 20:06.379
You're nothing.

20:22.275 --> 20:24.103
I'm gonna have
to write two checks

20:24.103 --> 20:25.965
for the size of that thing.

20:25.965 --> 20:28.793
And Venmo the rest.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.965
Oh.
Ooh.

21:03.758 --> 21:05.517
- Oh.
It's just you.

21:05.517 --> 21:08.034
- Oh, thanks, I'm not
getting that enough tonight.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.275
- Aw.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.034
- Can't hear myself think
out there.

21:11.034 --> 21:12.275
And what are you doing in here?

21:12.275 --> 21:13.793
- Rummaging.
I've found three--four

21:13.793 --> 21:15.965
different illegal substances
in four different rooms.

21:15.965 --> 21:18.413
It's like they're themed.

21:18.413 --> 21:21.241
- Remind me never
to leave you in my place alone.

21:21.241 --> 21:23.241
- What would I find?

21:23.241 --> 21:25.965
Have a special drawer, Jude?

21:25.965 --> 21:27.379
- Do you ever stop?

21:27.379 --> 21:31.344
- Not even when I hear
the safe word.

21:31.344 --> 21:32.551
- Can't believe
you were invited

21:32.551 --> 21:34.103
to a Devils party
and I wasn't.

21:34.103 --> 21:35.896
- I wasn't invited.

21:35.896 --> 21:37.758
- So you're crashing too.

21:37.758 --> 21:39.172
Kind of crazy we both

21:39.172 --> 21:42.551
meet somewhere neither
of us was supposed to be.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.586
- You're a romantic.

21:44.586 --> 21:46.586
- I didn't mean
that romantically.

21:46.586 --> 21:48.241
- You didn't have
to mean it that way

21:48.241 --> 21:50.862
for it to be that way.

21:52.275 --> 21:54.586
God, you're adorable
when you fidget.

21:54.586 --> 21:56.965
- I'm not adorable
when I anything.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.896
- Who told you that?

21:58.896 --> 22:01.068
- Anyone I've ever met.

22:01.068 --> 22:03.379
- You haven't met me.

22:10.896 --> 22:13.827
- You're my best friend.

22:13.827 --> 22:16.448
- Nope, that's a wrap.
No, get down off of there.

22:16.448 --> 22:18.413
My entire livelihood rests
on y'all.

22:18.413 --> 22:20.793
If I see one second
of this on Snapchat

22:20.793 --> 22:22.620
you will regret
this with your lives.

22:22.620 --> 22:24.172
- What about Insta?

22:24.172 --> 22:26.620
Mother--
- Fire!

22:47.000 --> 22:50.137
- Apparently,
cigars are bad for you,

22:50.137 --> 22:52.586
and a cracked gas line.

22:52.586 --> 22:55.586
Nobody got hurt, but,
it's basically destroyed.

22:55.586 --> 22:57.862
Maybe I'm still working through
a few things.

22:59.034 --> 23:01.448
- You could have called me.
- And said what?

23:01.448 --> 23:03.068
Your first big coaching
opportunity

23:03.068 --> 23:06.793
is a bomb ready to go off?
- Yeah.

23:06.793 --> 23:08.344
And I would have lit the wick.

23:08.344 --> 23:10.275
- You have more
to lose than I do.

23:10.275 --> 23:11.655
- What do I have
to lose, Derek?

23:11.655 --> 23:14.310
No one expects me
to turn this team around.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.586
And after Miami, everyone
knows you're a disaster.

23:17.586 --> 23:20.379
Look, man, if the Devils win,
I look amazing.

23:20.379 --> 23:24.310
If the Devils lose,
everyone's gonna blame you.

23:24.310 --> 23:27.068
I'm gambling with house money.

23:27.068 --> 23:29.482
But this...

23:29.482 --> 23:31.413
This is what I want
to see on the court.

23:31.413 --> 23:35.413
Derek in beast mode
is a glorious thing.

23:36.758 --> 23:38.137
Let's go beast.

23:38.137 --> 23:40.620
- My entire career,
my entire marriage,

23:40.620 --> 23:43.103
everything happened in
that house.

23:43.103 --> 23:45.206
- Freud says
"There are no mistakes."

23:45.206 --> 23:47.034
You meant to burn it down.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.517
- You quoting Freud now?

23:48.517 --> 23:50.379
- Freud, Lenny Kravtiz,
Kung-Fu Panda,

23:50.379 --> 23:53.137
I don't know who said it.

23:53.137 --> 23:56.137
But my point remains.

23:56.137 --> 23:59.413
I broke free
'cause I broke free.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.689
It's your turn.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.241
New chapter starts here.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.310
- Hi.
- Checking on me.

24:22.310 --> 24:23.931
I'm touched.

24:23.931 --> 24:26.275
- I was actually wondering
if you could stop rerunning

24:26.275 --> 24:27.758
your joke package on the fire.

24:27.758 --> 24:31.551
- Nope, sorry. Lionel gave me
M&M's because of it.

24:31.551 --> 24:35.275
I love M&M's.

24:35.275 --> 24:39.310
Okay. Okay, look.
Maybe I was...

24:39.310 --> 24:42.689
also checking on you.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.241
Look, my job...

24:44.241 --> 24:47.310
involves sensitive information,
things people can't know about.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.517
And I can't be with someone
who's gonna take

24:49.517 --> 24:52.896
everything I say
and just put it on blast.

24:52.896 --> 24:55.310
- And I can't keep a secret.

24:55.310 --> 24:59.482
I know me, Jude,
I'm physically incapable.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.551
I am a walking hot mic.

25:04.551 --> 25:06.758
It's either a fire you're
willing to play with

25:06.758 --> 25:09.827
or it's not.

25:33.517 --> 25:35.517
- Last night was interesting.

25:35.517 --> 25:37.103
- Interesting's a word
you'd use in

25:37.103 --> 25:39.724
a middle school book report.

25:39.724 --> 25:42.137
- Life-altering.

25:42.137 --> 25:43.551
- That's a start.

25:43.551 --> 25:47.896
- A start implies
a continuation.

25:47.896 --> 25:50.103
- Hmm...

25:50.103 --> 25:51.862
I have to get ready for
the game.

25:51.862 --> 25:53.931
See you around.

25:57.896 --> 26:00.103
- Since law school didn't work
out so well,

26:00.103 --> 26:03.689
next time try clown college.

26:03.689 --> 26:06.862
- Saved me my first question.

26:10.448 --> 26:13.103
Look, Jelena,
you put up a good fight,

26:13.103 --> 26:15.724
but at some point you need
to accept when it's game over.

26:15.724 --> 26:19.586
- If I haven't won
then it's not game over.

26:19.586 --> 26:24.413
- This may come as a shock,
Jelena, but people lose.

26:24.413 --> 26:26.689
I lost my marriage,
I lost my house--

26:26.689 --> 26:29.620
- Oh, good job with
that by the way.

26:29.620 --> 26:33.137
- Sometimes winning is what you
do with that loss.

26:33.137 --> 26:35.586
- What are you saying?

26:35.586 --> 26:37.310
- I'm saying
you're putting Miguel

26:37.310 --> 26:40.965
on a plane in a few hours.

26:40.965 --> 26:43.931
You need to prepare him.

26:56.758 --> 26:59.586
- Los Angeles Devils
number 23,

26:59.586 --> 27:02.000
Pete Davenport,
ladies and gentlemen.

27:30.931 --> 27:33.137
- Hands up, fellas!

27:44.310 --> 27:46.344
- How did you get in here?

27:46.344 --> 27:47.551
- Told security I was
looking for you.

27:47.551 --> 27:48.862
He let me right in.

27:48.862 --> 27:50.482
- People are gonna be talking
about this.

27:50.482 --> 27:52.413
- Let 'em.

27:52.413 --> 27:55.413
I came for your decision.
I've been waiting,

27:55.413 --> 27:56.931
grew impatient.

27:56.931 --> 27:59.000
- It took you months
to come to me,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.137
and you need to know if I'm
gonna get back with you

28:01.137 --> 28:03.689
in five minutes?

28:05.586 --> 28:08.586
You don't want me
to go on that court.

28:08.586 --> 28:10.068
You don't want me.

28:10.068 --> 28:12.758
You just don't want me
to make things worse for you.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.862
- Things are barely dying down,
London.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.724
Do you realize what going out
there would do to both of us?

28:18.724 --> 28:20.310
Dressed like that.

28:20.310 --> 28:22.931
If you go out there you're just
gonna keep things going,

28:22.931 --> 28:24.448
you're gonna whip it
right back up.

28:24.448 --> 28:27.482
- You never worried
about me in any of this.

28:27.482 --> 28:30.103
So I'm not gonna worry
about you.

28:30.103 --> 28:32.103
I'ma live my life.

28:32.103 --> 28:35.103
And if that hurts you...

28:35.103 --> 28:37.965
then too bad.

28:39.103 --> 28:41.724
You know when they call
your name out there,

28:41.724 --> 28:43.620
those 20,000 people?

28:43.620 --> 28:47.137
They might not be shouting it
the way you want.

28:56.206 --> 28:59.000
- Go to hell, Pastor.

29:09.275 --> 29:10.965
- You okay?

29:10.965 --> 29:12.724
- I just don't know if I want
to be tarred and feathered

29:12.724 --> 29:14.551
in front of an entire arena.

29:14.551 --> 29:16.586
- Well, the arena
and the rest of the country.

29:16.586 --> 29:17.862
- What are you talking about?

29:17.862 --> 29:19.655
- Well,
the sideline reporter

29:19.655 --> 29:21.793
told me ISN's broadcasting it,
so...

29:21.793 --> 29:24.620
whatever happens out there...

29:24.620 --> 29:26.586
- Oh, my God.
And I have a solo.

29:26.586 --> 29:28.034
Perfect way to single me out.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.000
- Well, I mean, I can do it.
I know it.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.965
- Whatever's about to happen
needs to happen real quick.

29:31.965 --> 29:34.068
We're up.

29:37.068 --> 29:40.137
- Thank you.
- I won't screw it up.

30:06.034 --> 30:07.931
get ya, get ya

32:27.344 --> 32:29.862
- Miguel.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.413
You know where you're going.

32:44.517 --> 32:47.103
This is a new chapter for you.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.068
It's scary.

32:52.896 --> 32:56.827
You've seen so much
by such a young age.

32:58.482 --> 33:00.379
So had I.

33:03.241 --> 33:07.517
I grew up in a house
that was not nice.

33:07.517 --> 33:10.275
I was scared every day.

33:11.758 --> 33:15.931
But, today I own a team.

33:15.931 --> 33:19.241
I got everything I ever wanted.

33:19.241 --> 33:22.000
And you wanna know how
I did it?

33:24.896 --> 33:27.793
By controlling my emotions.

33:27.793 --> 33:30.896
So no one could hurt me.

33:30.896 --> 33:33.482
And that's what you need to do.

33:35.310 --> 33:37.448
Be tough.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.931
Be strong.

33:41.689 --> 33:43.931
Turn off your feelings.

33:45.586 --> 33:48.103
I'll show you how it's done.

33:59.275 --> 34:01.827
I'm not taking you
to the airport.

34:01.827 --> 34:04.275
You're going with her.

34:13.689 --> 34:16.344
Goodbye.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.413
- Let's go, Miguel.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.068
- Devils take the tip.

34:40.068 --> 34:42.275
the outlet to Low.
Oh, and the follow-up.

34:42.275 --> 34:43.965
Beautiful put back.

34:47.758 --> 34:49.448
- Come on,
I don't see elbows!

34:49.448 --> 34:51.448
Come on!

34:52.482 --> 34:53.931
- Roman steals the ball.

34:53.931 --> 34:57.310
Quick touch pass
and back to Roman.

34:59.310 --> 35:01.551
Devils win.

35:08.620 --> 35:10.586
- Yeah!

35:12.793 --> 35:14.620
- It has been a really
difficult time for

35:14.620 --> 35:17.551
the star player recently with
the loss of his house but--

35:17.551 --> 35:20.551
- Yes, but the Devils' marquis
player was able to bring...

35:22.896 --> 35:25.551
- Perhaps released some
of his demons.

35:25.551 --> 35:27.241
- That has got
to be a great feeling

35:27.241 --> 35:29.103
for new coach,
German Vega.

35:29.103 --> 35:31.413
This could be a sign of good
things to come from him.

35:31.413 --> 35:33.000
- There's Roman showing you
tonight

35:33.000 --> 35:34.758
a completely dominant--

35:34.758 --> 35:36.586
- All right, baby,
first round of drinks

35:36.586 --> 35:38.379
at the Playground is on me!

35:38.379 --> 35:40.758
Hey, Devil girls too, all
right, my treat.

35:40.758 --> 35:42.275
- Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

35:42.275 --> 35:43.758
Y'all are grounded,
young ladies.

35:43.758 --> 35:45.758
You cost me some serious
coin last night.

35:45.758 --> 35:47.482
Now I gotta go back
on the prowl.

35:47.482 --> 35:49.724
No, I will be rich by
the end of this season

35:49.724 --> 35:51.689
or I'll kill y'all trying.

35:51.689 --> 35:53.000
- That was
the messiest dunk

35:53.000 --> 35:54.620
since my grandma
discovered Oreos.

35:54.620 --> 35:58.413
She's dead now, but
Derek Roman is very much alive.

35:58.413 --> 36:00.620
- You are jacked in the head.
Has anyone ever told you that?

36:00.620 --> 36:02.172
- Daily.

36:02.172 --> 36:04.068
Listen, hey, it's good
to be home, Devils nation.

36:04.068 --> 36:07.068
Rise up.
- Rise up!

36:08.344 --> 36:10.206
- So what did you think about
the dance?

36:10.206 --> 36:14.310
- Sick.
- So it looked good on camera?

36:15.689 --> 36:18.896
Jamie said you were airing it.
- Why would she say that?

36:27.655 --> 36:30.379
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

36:30.379 --> 36:32.379
- German.

36:32.379 --> 36:34.517
I'm Eve.

36:34.517 --> 36:37.931
Olivia and Chase's daughter.

36:37.931 --> 36:42.793
You took the fall for
what Raquel did to my mother.

36:42.793 --> 36:45.482
You were protecting
a single mom.

36:45.482 --> 36:48.724
And what my dad did
to you as a result,

36:48.724 --> 36:51.379
I just...

36:52.310 --> 36:56.068
If you ever need anything
just let me know.

37:08.758 --> 37:11.620
- Catch ya later, Jamie.
- Bye.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.137
- Congratulations.
The crowd loved your dance.

37:16.137 --> 37:20.241
- Congratulations
for stealing it.

37:20.241 --> 37:22.068
- But you were rattled.

37:22.068 --> 37:23.586
I took
the attention off of you.

37:23.586 --> 37:24.862
- And put it on yourself.

37:24.862 --> 37:26.724
- You worried about surviving
a scandal?

37:26.724 --> 37:29.034
You don't know
what surviving is.

37:29.034 --> 37:31.379
- I know what
dog-faced lying is.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.241
So much for having
each other's backs.

37:33.241 --> 37:35.448
- I didn't do it to hurt you.

37:35.448 --> 37:37.448
I did it to help me.

37:37.448 --> 37:40.482
- What matters is
that you did it at all.

37:40.482 --> 37:42.379
But that's my fault
for giving you the chance,

37:42.379 --> 37:44.965
and trust me I will never
make that mistake again.

37:44.965 --> 37:47.068
But I got your number, boo.

37:47.068 --> 37:49.586
Watch me call it.

37:54.517 --> 37:56.965
- Flight 839
direct service to Sydney

37:56.965 --> 37:58.448
will be departing shortly.

37:58.448 --> 38:01.724
Please have your boarding
passes out...

38:10.620 --> 38:13.241
- Miguel forgot his game.

38:16.896 --> 38:20.275
I sent him off in a way that...

38:20.758 --> 38:24.379
It wasn't right.

38:24.379 --> 38:28.068
I'm still responsible for him.

38:28.068 --> 38:30.379
I'll walk him to the gate.

38:30.379 --> 38:33.310
Give him the goodbye
the deserves.

38:34.689 --> 38:37.379
- Of course.

38:52.758 --> 38:55.310
- Where are we going?

38:55.310 --> 38:58.862
- I said I would walk you
to the gate.

38:58.862 --> 39:01.896
I didn't say which one.

39:01.896 --> 39:06.413
You know, Miguel, I forgot
the most important lesson.

39:06.413 --> 39:09.551
You can't lose
if you change the game.

39:19.379 --> 39:21.310
- Another Vincent
in Devils Arena.

39:21.310 --> 39:23.724
- When I got the job
at the League,

39:23.724 --> 39:26.068
there was no Derek Roman in
Devils Arena either.

39:26.068 --> 39:27.551
Life's full of surprises.

39:27.551 --> 39:29.275
- Well, hopefully
I'm a good one.

39:29.275 --> 39:30.620
- Well, you will certainly be
good for ratings.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.827
Can you shatter
a backboard every game?

39:32.827 --> 39:35.551
- I'll see what I can do.
- Okay.

39:35.551 --> 39:40.137
- Jude, where've you been?
Where's Jelana?

39:42.137 --> 39:43.551
Jude.
- Jelana's gone.

39:43.551 --> 39:46.551
She, uh, took Miguel.
She's gone.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.103
- Wait, what do you mean
she took off?

39:49.103 --> 39:50.379
What about the team?

39:50.379 --> 39:54.000
- She did a quick sale.
- To who?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.137
- Me.

39:56.137 --> 39:58.413
I'm the new owner
of the Los Angeles Devils.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.758
- Next time on
"Hit The Floor"...

40:09.758 --> 40:11.275
- That must feel good.
- Doesn't feel bad.

40:11.275 --> 40:12.586
- You don't know feeling bad.
Yet.

40:12.586 --> 40:14.586
- We're gonna make millions
together!

40:14.586 --> 40:16.344
- Oh, God!

40:16.344 --> 40:18.344
- How would you
feel making double?

40:18.344 --> 40:21.586
- Why don't we go triple?
- I thought you'd never ask.

40:21.586 --> 40:25.000
- You are in some back office
and I'm on the damn court.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.413
You don't like it,
trade me.

40:26.413 --> 40:28.655
- I need some gas thrown
on a fire.

40:28.655 --> 40:30.275
- If you want
an explosion

40:30.275 --> 40:32.310
you're gonna have to dig deep
to some real shit.

40:32.310 --> 40:34.482
- Oh!
