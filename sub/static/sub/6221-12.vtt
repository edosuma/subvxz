DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.181
His name, Merlin.

00:16.392 --> 00:18.227
(HORSE WHINNIES)

00:24.775 --> 00:25.943
-Boo!
-Oh!

00:27.111 --> 00:29.655
-Did I surprise you?
-You certainly did!

00:29.947 --> 00:31.449
I've got another surprise for you, too.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.119
(TOM CHUCKLES)

00:39.624 --> 00:40.917
It's lovely.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.960
In case you ever need a spare,

00:43.252 --> 00:44.253
you know,

00:44.587 --> 00:46.964
for this.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.966
It's beautiful!

00:50.051 --> 00:52.803
But you're a beautiful girl, Gwen.
You deserve beautiful things.

00:53.763 --> 00:55.056
But how? I mean...

00:55.431 --> 00:56.682
It must have been expensive.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.393
Oh, very. But we're on the up now.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.145
Things are going to be different.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.105
What's going on?

01:03.189 --> 01:05.650
It will be all right. Trust me.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.987

01:34.345 --> 01:35.346
Yes.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.848
Look.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.820
TAUREN: Very good.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.577
What is that?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.038
I'm not paying you to ask questions.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.124
The lead, please.

(CHANTING)

02:28.190 --> 02:30.776

(SIZZLING)

02:56.844 --> 03:00.264
Yours, blacksmith,
if you keep your mouth shut.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.934
Seize them!

03:04.810 --> 03:05.853
Quickly, after him!

03:08.481 --> 03:10.441
GUARD: Stop!
ARTHUR: He must be caught.

03:10.608 --> 03:11.984
GUARD: Stop that man.

03:13.944 --> 03:17.031
TOM: Sire, please...

03:17.114 --> 03:18.157
You're under arrest.

03:55.111 --> 03:56.445
GAIUS: Can't sleep?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.323
Something woke me.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.200
What?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.160
| don't know.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.413
A feeling.

04:06.831 --> 04:08.457
What kind of feeling?

04:10.126 --> 04:12.002
Powerful magic. Here, in Camelot.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.504
(DOOR OPENING)

04:14.213 --> 04:15.423
Gwen! What's wrong?

04:15.506 --> 04:17.173
My father's been arrested.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.426
Arrested? What for?

04:18.509 --> 04:20.678
They say he was
making weapons for a sorcerer.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.388
They're charging him with treason.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.307
-Treason?
-Yes, Morgana. Treason.

04:25.391 --> 04:28.310
The blacksmith was consorting
with a known enemy.

04:28.394 --> 04:31.105
-Enemy? What enemy?
-ARTHUR: Tauren.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.649
The leader of a band
of renegade sorcerers

04:33.732 --> 04:35.943
sworn to bring down the king.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.612
And where is this Tauren now?

04:39.155 --> 04:40.281
He escaped.

04:40.406 --> 04:41.782
Well, then how can you be sure?

04:41.866 --> 04:44.827
Because Arthur saw him
with his own eyes.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.745
Even if the man is who you say he is,

04:46.829 --> 04:48.873
you can't sentence Tom to death
for just being seen with him.

04:49.081 --> 04:52.084
We have reason to believe
he was forging weapons for Tauren.

04:52.168 --> 04:54.044
Rubbish!
He would never do such a thing.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.047
Every man has a price.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.385
Found this on the blacksmith.

05:02.011 --> 05:03.304
So, he was paid!

05:03.554 --> 05:05.389
He's a blacksmith. He could've been paid

05:05.473 --> 05:07.558
-for shoeing Tauren's horse!
-In gold?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.728
This is madness.
You condemn a man with no proof.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.354
| have enough proof.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.401
Arthur, have you nothing to say?

05:21.447 --> 05:23.240
Father, the blacksmith
committed a crime,

05:24.408 --> 05:26.660
but we don't know for certain
he meant treason.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.625
No, you are right. Nothing's certain.

05:33.918 --> 05:38.506
Save one thing.
The law stands or this kingdom falls.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.424
But the law must give him a fair trial.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.301
He'll get a fair trial

05:42.384 --> 05:44.595
and he'll be found guilty
'cause that's what he is.

05:46.889 --> 05:51.018
You execute Gwen's father,
and I will never forgive you.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.230
Never.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.446
Maybe we should investigate further.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.740
Tauren slept somewhere,
he fed somewhere.

06:05.366 --> 06:09.662
Find anyone who helped him in any way.
They must be punished.

06:09.745 --> 06:14.333
The people must see the laws of Camelot
are not to be trifled with.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.711
Yes, Father.

06:19.713 --> 06:24.176
TOM: I didn't know Tauren was
a sorcerer. I meant no harm, I swear.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.762
GWEN: Why didn't you tell me
what was going on?

06:26.845 --> 06:30.766
TOM: I knew you wouldn't like it, Gwen.
You're cautious.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.977
| didn't want to let
an opportunity pass...

06:33.060 --> 06:34.895
Opportunity?

06:34.979 --> 06:36.564
You call this an opportunity?

06:36.814 --> 06:38.357
(SIGHS) I know.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.900
I've been a fool.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.860
(EXHALES)

06:41.944 --> 06:45.114
| just wanted to make
a better life for us.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.949
For you.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.910
| wanted to make you happy.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.412
But I am happy!

06:51.996 --> 06:53.455
| don't need anything else.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.332
| have everything I want.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.501
And I've thrown it all away.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.004
It's all right.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.882
We will get you out of here, I promise.

07:09.888 --> 07:10.931
What did he say?

07:11.265 --> 07:13.100
He said Tauren came
to him at the forge,

07:13.183 --> 07:14.810
offered to pay a fortune for his help.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.103
Not to make weapons.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.438
For an experiment or something.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.647
What kind of experiment?

07:18.731 --> 07:22.443
Tauren didn't say.
But he used some kind of stone.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.696
Some kind of magic.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.365
She's sleeping now.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.783
| don't understand it.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.994
What would a sorcerer want with Tom?

07:32.077 --> 07:35.122
His forge, Merlin.
It's the finest in the kingdom.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.749
You think Tom was lying?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.626
You think he really was making weapons?

07:38.709 --> 07:40.919
-No, I don't.
-Then what?

07:41.420 --> 07:43.714
When Tom was arrested,
they found gold on him.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.840
So?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.717
From what Gwen was saying,

07:47.426 --> 07:51.847
Tauren's experiment bears
all the hallmarks of alchemy.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.058
Alchemy's impossible, isn't it?

07:54.183 --> 07:56.560
To change the very nature
of one thing to another

07:56.644 --> 07:58.854
has defeated all who have tried.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.607
But if you used magic.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.445
Do you think that's what woke me?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.406
It's possible, I suppose.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.159
(ROOSTER CROWS)

08:16.789 --> 08:19.083

08:20.918 --> 08:23.087

-Merlin.
-Morgana?

09:25.691 --> 09:26.775
How is she?

09:27.151 --> 09:28.402
She's doing okay.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.323
MORGANA: We should let her rest.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.832
Morgana, have you spoken to Uther?

09:42.207 --> 09:45.586
He must realize this is a mistake.
Whatever Tom was doing,

09:45.669 --> 09:47.463
it wasn't plotting against the king.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.256
| know that. Of course I do.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.675
But, Uther...

09:52.134 --> 09:54.178
Uther only sees enemies.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.806
But Tom is the most gentle soul
I've ever met.

09:59.141 --> 10:02.686
But he was seen with Tauren.
That makes him an enemy.

10:05.481 --> 10:09.359
Then, there's little hope?

10:10.235 --> 10:11.987
There's no hope, Merlin.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.490
None at all.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.875

you were comfortable.

-She's a brave girl.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.577
She wishes only to see you free.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.040
| know what Uther thinks about sorcery.

11:06.625 --> 11:10.045
-I'm a dead man, aren't |I?
- I cannot see the future,

11:10.128 --> 11:11.755
only the present,

11:14.633 --> 11:17.386
and one must always seize the moment.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.099
Good luck.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.407
-They're to be executed?
-Yes, Merlin.

11:38.490 --> 11:42.202
-By order of the king?
-They committed a very serious crime.

11:42.286 --> 11:45.747
-Giving a man a bed for the night?
-Not a man. A sorcerer.

11:45.831 --> 11:46.999
Maybe they didn't know that.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.501
It is not for you to
question my father's actions.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.169
Is that understood?

11:51.587 --> 11:52.838
Yes, sire.

11:53.130 --> 11:56.842
Now go. Get on with whatever
you're meant to be doing.

that you are speaking to your king?

14:31.038 --> 14:34.291
May I remind you
that a king is wise and just?

14:34.416 --> 14:37.127
You are neither.
You rule only with the sword.

of what it means to be king.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.604

Only a mad man hears the truth
as treason.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.486
Take care, child,
or I'll have you restrained.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.155

And you will remain here
until you learn your lesson.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.798
Then release me
because I have learned it already.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.593
That you care not for me,
nor anyone, but yourself.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.929

17:50.946 --> 17:51.988
What does it do?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.699
Theoretically, it could give the bearer

17:54.824 --> 17:57.327
the power of transformation.

17:59.663 --> 18:00.872
Gold.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.083
The power of alchemy.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.501
Exactly.

18:04.918 --> 18:09.422
| believe it was the Mage Stone
you sensed on the night of Tom's arrest.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.757
Of course!

18:12.592 --> 18:15.095
Gwen said that Tauren had
some kind of stone.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.807
(DOOR OPENING)

18:24.271 --> 18:25.480
You.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.441
How proud you must be.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.860
Son of the mighty Uther.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.029
How you must look up to him.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.785
Does the king's little
helper bring a message,

18:38.868 --> 18:40.328
or have you just come to gloat?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.500
Guards!

18:47.836 --> 18:50.213
Get away from me, you cowards!

18:50.338 --> 18:52.173
You're free to go.

19:00.724 --> 19:01.891
Morgana?

19:02.434 --> 19:03.476
Yes?

19:05.687 --> 19:09.649
| swore to him you'd never challenge
his authority again.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.027
| swore that you'd learned your lesson.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.904
Tread carefully.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.241
Next time, I may not
be able to help you.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.912
Thank you.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.373
You're a better man than your father.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.500
Always were.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.047
My lady?

19:32.881 --> 19:34.466
Gwen.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.761
| didn't expect to see you here.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.265
-What happened to you?
-Nothing.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.977
Well, nothing a hot bath wouldn't fix.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.776
| spent the night in the dungeon.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.111
Uther.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.238
He doesn't like to be challenged.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.451
It wasn't about my father, was it?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.789
You've enough to deal with
without worrying about such things.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.791
You shouldn't have done that.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.959
Not on my behalf.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.671
If anything happened to you,
| couldn't bear it.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.259
You need to go home, Gwen.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.011
Get some rest, please.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.137
I'm fine, my lady.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.310
| insist.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.354
Gwen?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.943
-Gwen?
-I can't go home.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.908
It's understandable to feel so alone.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.828
Tauren.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.580
Tauren?

20:49.916 --> 20:53.169
He attacked me. He threatened me.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.964
He was looking for some kind of stone.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.341
A stone?

20:58.425 --> 21:00.593
He said if I didn't bring it to him,
he'd kill me.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.178
He's waiting for me
in the Darkling Woods.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.973
| have to do something.

21:05.056 --> 21:09.352
If I don't get this stone to him
by dawn tomorrow...

21:11.646 --> 21:13.273
What are you going to do?

21:14.274 --> 21:16.734
I'm going to send the guards,
of course.

21:16.818 --> 21:20.405
It won't be you that Tauren meets.
It will be the knights of Camelot.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.123
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)

22:57.794 --> 23:00.922
-Where's your maid?
- have come in her place.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.092
-Kill her.
-No, wait. I brought the stone!

23:04.175 --> 23:07.428
What else have you brought, my lady?
The knights of Camelot?

23:08.513 --> 23:10.139
MORGANA: I came alone.
| promise you.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.017
Give me the stone.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.480
You were foolish to come here.

23:18.690 --> 23:21.067
| had no quarrel with your maid.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.779
But you, my lady Morgana.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.699
You are Uther's ward.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.952
If you kill me, you'll regret it.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.746
Why's that?

23:34.497 --> 23:39.085
-Because I want Uther dead, too.
-You? An enemy of the king?

23:39.419 --> 23:40.795
And I'm to believe that?

23:40.878 --> 23:42.755
Why else would I be here?

23:42.839 --> 23:45.049
| can only guess at your motives,
my lady.

23:45.842 --> 23:48.177
You could be a spy for all I know.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.430
And this?

23:51.055 --> 23:54.350
Is it usual for Uther to chain
his friends to a dungeon wall?

24:04.694 --> 24:06.321
The stone.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.448
You took it to the forge. Why?

24:09.157 --> 24:11.826
With it, a man can alter
the very essence of things.

24:13.369 --> 24:17.165
He can turn a lump of lead into gold.

24:17.707 --> 24:21.711
Gold? A good man died
in your quest for riches, Tauren.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.047
His daughter is now an orphan.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.508
I'm sorry for that. Truly.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.387
But we did not want the gold
to line our pockets.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.514
The gold was but a means.

24:34.349 --> 24:38.728
A means to rid this kingdom
of Uther Pendragon once and for all.

24:39.687 --> 24:40.980
What are you saying?

24:41.064 --> 24:43.650
Bribery is rife at Camelot.

24:45.068 --> 24:47.528
| will use the corruption
at the heart of his kingdom,

24:48.571 --> 24:52.075
and such abundance of gold
will buy me into the king's chambers.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.661
Even to the king himself.

24:54.911 --> 24:58.039
The guards may be fools, Tauren,
but the king is not.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.417
Do you have a better plan?

25:02.043 --> 25:04.921
To get to Uther,
you need someone close to him.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.758
And you know of such a person?

25:09.926 --> 25:11.552
| do.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.513
Me.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.935
GAIUS: Pass the salt, please.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.115
-You all right?
-What?

25:33.282 --> 25:37.286
Yeah. Just got a few things
on my mind, that's all.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.916
Anything you'd like
to talk to me about?

25:44.252 --> 25:46.629
| can't imagine you'd be interested.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.092
So long as you're sure.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.971
| should be getting to work.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.765
Uh, Merlin?

26:00.476 --> 26:02.145
That's a broom cupboard.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.592
(CLEARS THROAT)

26:41.100 --> 26:46.481
Well, young warlock,
what is it you come to ask of me?

26:47.815 --> 26:49.358
| need your help.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.694
Of course you do,

26:52.487 --> 26:56.866
but this time, will you heed my words?

26:58.659 --> 27:02.622
The sorcerer Tauren
is plotting to kill the king.

27:02.705 --> 27:04.248
He's made an ally of Morgana.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.375
| don't know what to do!

27:06.793 --> 27:10.588
Do nothing.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.465
What do you mean?

27:12.882 --> 27:14.759
If I do nothing, Uther will die.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.970
Don't you want Uther dead?

27:18.054 --> 27:22.892
It is Uther that persecutes
you and your kind, Merlin.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.978
It is Uther that
murders the innocent...

27:26.062 --> 27:28.564
But surely that
doesn't make it right to kill him.

27:28.815 --> 27:33.236
Only if Uther dies
can magic return to the land.

27:33.903 --> 27:37.740
Only if Uther dies,
will you be free, Merlin.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.951
Uther's reign is at an end.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.246
Let Arthur's reign begin.

27:44.539 --> 27:47.375
Fulfill your destiny.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.168
Wait!

27:49.252 --> 27:53.005
Where does it say
my destiny includes murder?

27:53.422 --> 27:56.926
Free this land from tyranny, Merlin.

27:58.219 --> 28:00.930
Free us all!

28:10.565 --> 28:12.191
(DOOR OPENING)

28:13.776 --> 28:15.611
| didn't expect to see you.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.074
You wish to say something?

28:20.783 --> 28:22.410
| came to apologize, my lord.

28:22.493 --> 28:23.619
Good.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.248
| didn't mean to rile you.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.793
| thought only of Gwen.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.881
Poor girl's all alone in the world.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.675
Not my intention to hurt your maid.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.302
| know.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.554
But now she suffers.

28:41.637 --> 28:44.473
-And I know how she must suffer.
-Morgana...

28:44.599 --> 28:48.185
| only meant...
| know what it's like to lose a father.

28:54.025 --> 28:57.820
That was a terrible day.
Your father was a great friend.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.324
| had no part in his death.

29:01.532 --> 29:03.618
You sent him into battle.

29:04.952 --> 29:08.748
You promised him reinforcements
and then gave him none.

29:09.665 --> 29:10.833
You sent him to his death.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.293
That is not true.

29:12.835 --> 29:13.920
It was never my intention.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.796
But it happened!

29:16.047 --> 29:17.673
And it keeps on happening.

29:18.716 --> 29:19.884
Morgana.

29:20.051 --> 29:21.552
I'm sorry, my lord.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.901
Do you think Uther's a good king?

29:39.028 --> 29:40.029
Sorry?

29:40.404 --> 29:41.572
(CLEARS THROAT)

29:41.697 --> 29:44.492
Uther.
Do you think he's good for the kingdom?

29:47.328 --> 29:49.872
Yes. Yes, I do.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.544
In the light of recent events,
you may find that hard to believe.

29:56.087 --> 29:58.798
Hard? No.
Impossible? Definitely.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.010
-Merlin...
-Everyone hates him.

30:05.721 --> 30:08.224
It's not Uther's job to be liked.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.436
It is Uther's job
to protect the kingdom.

30:12.728 --> 30:16.023
Most of his methods are right.
Sometimes he may go too far.

30:16.107 --> 30:17.650
Really? You mean, like executing anyone

30:17.733 --> 30:19.235
who even passes
a sorcerer on the street?

30:21.570 --> 30:22.697
Yes.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.574
Despite Uther's failings,

30:26.117 --> 30:29.912
he has brought peace and prosperity
to this kingdom.

30:30.121 --> 30:31.372
But at what cost?

30:32.081 --> 30:34.417
At the cost of women and children,
fathers and sons.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.085
When will it end?

30:37.253 --> 30:39.171
It will end when Arthur is king.

30:39.422 --> 30:41.590
Then why not let that time be now?

30:43.092 --> 30:45.344
Why not let Arthur be king?

30:45.803 --> 30:47.555
Arthur's not ready.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.307
The responsibility would be too great.

30:50.433 --> 30:54.061
Brave though he may be,
he lacks experience, he lacks judgment.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.781
Is there anything you want to tell me?

31:05.906 --> 31:09.285
| can't. I just... No, I can't.

31:09.827 --> 31:11.704
You've just got to trust me.

31:13.122 --> 31:15.916
Gaius, it's something
I've got to work out for myself.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.335
| do trust you, Merlin.

31:19.587 --> 31:25.051
Whatever it is,
| know you'll make the right decision.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.824
Morgana.

31:52.495 --> 31:53.954
I'm not disturbing you, I hope.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.206
Not at all.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.544
These are difficult times.

32:01.629 --> 32:03.881
They put a strain on us all.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.175
Yes, my lord.

32:08.511 --> 32:12.014
| cannot tell you how much it pains me
to be at odds with you.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.849
And |, with you.

32:19.063 --> 32:21.190
I've been thinking about what you said.

32:22.233 --> 32:26.737
And I realize,

32:26.821 --> 32:29.365
| may have been insensitive.

32:30.032 --> 32:34.745
| should have foreseen the distress
that your maid's loss would cause you.

32:37.039 --> 32:38.749
That it would stir old memories.

32:42.503 --> 32:47.049
I've opened an old wound.
And for that I'm sorry.

32:49.385 --> 32:52.763
My lord, it gladdens my heart
to hear these words.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.433
|, too, wish to heal these wounds.

32:58.352 --> 33:01.730
Let us visit my father's grave
together and put the past behind us.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.567
Nothing would give me greater happiness.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.112
Shall we leave tomorrow at first light?

33:08.404 --> 33:09.822
| will make arrangements.

33:25.588 --> 33:26.672
Psst!

33:39.435 --> 33:42.396
So, my lady, what news?

33:42.479 --> 33:43.522
Uther's fallen for the bait.

33:43.606 --> 33:45.983
We ride out in the morning
for the Old Cairn on the hill.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.904
Are you sure you're committed to this?

33:49.987 --> 33:53.699
More than ever, I want Uther dead.
As much as you.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.869
As much as anyone
in this rotten kingdom of his.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.121
Then the deed is as good as done.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.393
Merlin?

34:22.937 --> 34:23.938
Gwen.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.190
How are you doing?

34:26.732 --> 34:29.525
| was about to ask you
the same question.

34:30.319 --> 34:33.155
I'm fine. Fine.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.827
GWEN: Morgana's been amazing
these last few days.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.331
| think you've been amazing.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.460
After this all has happened,

34:50.505 --> 34:52.382
getting your life back together.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.261
It's better than sitting
in an empty house,

34:55.344 --> 34:57.846
waiting for my father
to walk through the door.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.643
The thing I find hardest to bear

35:02.726 --> 35:06.689
is that people will always think he
was guilty because he tried to escape.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.357
| know he was innocent.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.652
| think he tried to escape
because he knew

35:11.735 --> 35:13.612
that whatever he said or did,
he'd be killed.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.866
Uther had already made up his mind.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.203
That's the kind of man he is.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.252
| wouldn't blame you
if you wanted him dead.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.674
If Uther died, I'd feel nothing.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.053
He means nothing to me.

35:39.263 --> 35:46.228
But if you had, you know,
the choice, what would you do?

35:47.730 --> 35:51.108
If you had the power of life
and death over Uther,

35:53.569 --> 35:56.739
would you Kill him for what he did?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.327
No.

36:05.456 --> 36:06.665
No?

36:09.001 --> 36:10.044
What would that solve?

36:12.338 --> 36:14.923
That would make me a murderer.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.717
That would make me as bad as him.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.513
You're right.

36:25.309 --> 36:26.935
Of course, you're right.

36:28.604 --> 36:31.273
-Is anything wrong?
-No, no. See you later.

37:29.331 --> 37:32.418
Do you think
that we could have some privacy?

37:32.501 --> 37:35.504
Fine. Wait here. We're in no danger.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.839
GUARD: Fine.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.523
(MERLIN PANTING)

38:25.888 --> 38:27.306
Father.

38:33.979 --> 38:34.980
(SPEAKS INCANTATION)

38:45.574 --> 38:49.244
Your father was the greatest man
I've ever known.

38:49.786 --> 38:53.916
He stood for everything
this kingdom represents.

38:55.959 --> 38:59.796
Truth, justice, valor.

39:02.466 --> 39:06.261
A hundred times, he saved my life
on the battlefield.

39:07.471 --> 39:10.766
His courage and his honor
were without equal.

39:23.654 --> 39:27.032
When Gorlois died, I lost
the truest friend I ever had.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.411
For he was as fearless
in questioning my judgment

39:31.495 --> 39:33.330
as he was in defending my kingdom.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.875
That's the mark of a true friend.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.505
| know how he respected you, my lord.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.509
But I don't share these memories.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.181
How can |? I was 10 years old.

39:52.516 --> 39:56.186
| only know I loved him.
And he was taken from me.

40:01.817 --> 40:05.487
When he died
and I took you into my care,

40:07.155 --> 40:09.700
you fought me from the beginning.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.661
Your will is as strong as my own.

40:14.329 --> 40:18.667
You challenge me as a friend must,
as your father did in his time.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.169
And when I do, you clap me in irons.

40:22.713 --> 40:28.802
| know I'm not an easy man.
My temper blinds me sometimes.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.512
There are things that I regret.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.139
Gwen's father?

40:37.019 --> 40:38.353
Yes.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.942
Are you saying you were wrong
to have Tom killed?

40:45.736 --> 40:47.070
Yes.

41:04.546 --> 41:05.714
(CHANTING)

41:20.228 --> 41:24.691
UTHER: I will strive to listen
to you more and quarrel with you less.

41:25.567 --> 41:29.863
You have been a blessing to me, Morgana.
You are the daughter I never had.

41:30.030 --> 41:33.909
Your counsel is invaluable,
as is your friendship and your love.

41:34.785 --> 41:38.455
Without you, I cannot hope
to be the king this land deserves.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.916
-My lord...
-Please forgive me, Morgana.

41:42.417 --> 41:43.627
No!

42:06.274 --> 42:09.111
Die, Uther Pendragon!

42:15.617 --> 42:16.785
(SWORD SLICING)

42:27.796 --> 42:30.382
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

43:05.500 --> 43:08.044
-GAIUS: Ah! Busy day?
-It had its moments.

43:08.170 --> 43:10.213
| hear that Tauren tried
to assassinate Uther.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.924
-That's what I hear.
-And that Morgana saved him.

43:13.008 --> 43:15.677
How many men were there? Three? Four?

43:15.761 --> 43:18.013
-Something like that.
-Morgana must have shown

43:18.096 --> 43:21.183
extraordinary courage to have defended
the king against such odds.

43:21.516 --> 43:25.020
| suppose,
you had nothing to do with it?

43:25.771 --> 43:28.565
You know, just background stuff.

43:29.441 --> 43:31.401
No need to be so modest, Merlin.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.404
-Sorry.
-It's not a criticism.

43:35.197 --> 43:36.364
It's a compliment.

43:37.365 --> 43:38.408
Right.

43:41.203 --> 43:42.829
Thanks, Gaius.

43:57.219 --> 43:58.345
Somebody help me.

43:58.428 --> 43:59.721
(SCREAMS)

44:07.813 --> 44:10.565
Please, Merlin.
This is only the beginning.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.987
You should not have killed my friend.
