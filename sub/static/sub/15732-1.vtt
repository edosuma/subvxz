05:00.367 --> 05:02.619
Mmm-hmm.

07:04.741 --> 07:06.117
It's just not...

07:20.924 --> 07:22.342
I'm sorry.

08:02.841 --> 08:05.176
Well, there's a Chilean Cabernet
or an Aussie Shiraz.

08:05.260 --> 08:06.928
Everything else costs an arm and a leg.

08:09.806 --> 08:11.433
I want whatever they're having.

08:20.692 --> 08:21.985
Stop staring.

08:22.777 --> 08:24.237
He's the one who's staring. Look.

08:32.370 --> 08:33.580
Hello?

08:34.831 --> 08:37.207
Uh... No, that's fine.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.711
I might be a couple
of minutes late, though.

08:39.753 --> 08:43.089
Oh. Or there's a Château Pétrus
for 16,000 euro we might try.

08:43.173 --> 08:44.924
Great, thank you. Bye.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.635
They moved my call forward.

08:48.803 --> 08:49.929
All right. See you later.

08:51.973 --> 08:54.309
I did tell you that
I'd have to do some work.

09:14.579 --> 09:16.748
Come have a drink with us.

09:16.831 --> 09:18.958
- Uh, I'm okay, thanks.
- It's not okay.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.086
Your woman just left you.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.047
Come on. Don't be a sourpussy.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.340
Sourpuss, actually.

09:25.423 --> 09:27.342
Sourpuss. Okay, don't be a sourpuss.

09:27.592 --> 09:29.260
Come on, have a drink with us.

09:33.264 --> 09:35.266
What the fuck? Come on.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.153
That is Niki, Andrei.

09:48.571 --> 09:50.698
Ah, you don't need to know those people.

09:51.074 --> 09:52.992
- I'm Dima.
- Perry.

09:53.076 --> 09:54.953
Sit down, Perry. Do you want some wine?

09:55.036 --> 09:56.913
- Sure.
- Château Pétrus.

09:58.248 --> 09:59.582
There you go.

10:03.378 --> 10:05.922
Why did your woman leave you, Perry?

10:06.005 --> 10:08.007
- Ah, she had to make a call.
- Call the kids?

10:08.091 --> 10:09.175
No, we don't have any kids.

10:09.259 --> 10:11.261
You don't have time for kids?

10:11.344 --> 10:12.720
You a banker?

10:12.762 --> 10:14.597
No, I teach at a university.

10:14.681 --> 10:18.351
A teacher. Then how the fuck
can you afford this restaurant?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.311
Um...

10:21.187 --> 10:22.939
My wife is a successful lawyer.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.149
How long are you in Morocco for?

10:25.316 --> 10:26.818
We leave in a couple of days.

10:27.944 --> 10:30.238
Why don't you come to
a party with us tonight?

10:30.321 --> 10:31.364
It's a Russian party.

10:31.489 --> 10:33.074
Maybe another time.

10:33.157 --> 10:35.368
What other time? I'll never
fucking see you again.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.912
- I can't tonight.
- What?

10:37.996 --> 10:40.123
Your lawyer wife pussy-whip you?

10:40.206 --> 10:42.083
You have to ask her permission?

10:45.336 --> 10:47.380
Let's play a game.

10:47.463 --> 10:48.882
Show me your credit card.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.760
Show me your credit card.
Hold it up to me.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.178
It's a game.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.897
Now put it away.

11:04.981 --> 11:08.651
If I remember the number on that card,
you come with me to the party,

11:08.735 --> 11:12.363
and if I fuck up,
I'll give you $5,000, okay?

11:12.614 --> 11:13.823
All right.

11:14.699 --> 11:21.497
5673 0976 21 21 0508.

11:28.046 --> 11:29.756
Call your wife, Professor.

11:36.054 --> 11:37.347
Hey, it's me again.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.432
Look, you must still be on your call.

11:39.515 --> 11:43.019
I popped out for a drink with
those guys from the restaurant

11:43.102 --> 11:45.271
and I just didn't want you to worry.

11:45.355 --> 11:47.357
So I'll see you later, okay? Bye.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.606
No, no.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.445
- Dima.
- Maria.

12:37.865 --> 12:39.951
Meet my friend, Perry. This is Maria.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.702
Nice to meet...

12:41.786 --> 12:43.871
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:43.955 --> 12:45.039
You will look after him tonight?

12:45.123 --> 12:47.125
Of course. No problem.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.669
- Perry, come with me.
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

13:00.054 --> 13:01.264
You want some?

13:05.101 --> 13:06.394
Okay.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.489
So, what do you teach?

13:18.573 --> 13:19.907
Oh. It's so boring.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.493
Tell me.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.456
Poetics.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.208
Poetry isn't boring.

13:29.292 --> 13:31.294
It is when you study it
under a microscope.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.589
Then why do you do it?

13:34.672 --> 13:36.966
I don't know. Lack of imagination.

13:37.008 --> 13:38.551
I don't believe you.

13:39.594 --> 13:41.387
Oh. You're very pretty.

13:41.470 --> 13:42.680
So are you.

13:50.813 --> 13:52.064
Let me get you another drink.

13:52.148 --> 13:53.983
Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks.

14:00.698 --> 14:02.116
Oh, my God.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.453
Oh, shit.

14:09.165 --> 14:10.666
Professor!

14:13.669 --> 14:15.546
Oh. What am I doing here?

14:52.708 --> 14:54.126
Help! Stop!

15:00.800 --> 15:03.219
- No!
- Hey, hey! Get off her!

15:07.932 --> 15:09.975
Fucking prick. Come on, then!

15:10.017 --> 15:11.268
Hey, he's my guest.

15:14.855 --> 15:16.857
Go, go, go. Go, go.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.445
Okay, Professor?

15:21.529 --> 15:23.239
What the fuck is going on?

15:32.957 --> 15:36.127
You're a crazy motherfucker, Professor.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.212
Did you see that guy's tattoos?

15:39.380 --> 15:42.383
The knife on the neck
means he kills people.

15:42.967 --> 15:46.178
The stars on the shoulders
means he's a big mafia guy.

15:46.971 --> 15:48.722
I wish I'd known that at the time.

15:48.806 --> 15:50.891
It wouldn't have made any difference.

15:51.892 --> 15:53.561
You're a gentleman.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.272
Man of honour.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.033
You know what this is?

16:08.534 --> 16:09.702
Um...

16:10.369 --> 16:11.579
Virgin Mary?

16:11.662 --> 16:12.913
It's my mother.

16:13.956 --> 16:15.958
When I was a kid in Russia,
we had no money,

16:16.041 --> 16:21.714
so my mother fucked this Kagbeshnik,
KGB guy, so we could eat, you know.

16:21.797 --> 16:24.425
He was like that guy.
He liked to hurt women.

16:24.842 --> 16:27.803
One day, I come home and he's there

16:27.887 --> 16:30.890
and he's fucking her like an animal

16:30.973 --> 16:32.850
and slapping her.

16:32.933 --> 16:34.768
I'm just standing there.

16:34.852 --> 16:37.646
And my mother looks at me.
She doesn't say anything.

16:38.689 --> 16:42.151
So I take his gun and I kill him.

16:43.986 --> 16:45.362
What the fuck?

16:45.988 --> 16:48.324
It was my mother. You get sentimental.

16:56.874 --> 16:58.918
You play tennis, Professor?

16:59.126 --> 17:00.294
Yes, a little.

17:00.377 --> 17:01.545
We'll play today.

17:01.795 --> 17:03.213
I have to spend the day with my wife.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.007
Ah, we'll play early.

17:14.849 --> 17:16.185
Good return, Viktor.

17:23.025 --> 17:24.859
It's yours, Viktor. Take it, take it!

17:25.277 --> 17:27.195
Game Russia.

17:29.156 --> 17:31.533
It's okay. Just hit it to my dad.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.118
What the fuck?

17:33.160 --> 17:35.162
We'll get them next time. Come on.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.972
Okay, we've got this. Come on.

17:55.766 --> 17:57.267
Here we go.

18:01.438 --> 18:03.065
Morning. You got my note, then?

18:03.148 --> 18:04.233
Yeah, I did.

18:09.988 --> 18:12.491
- Out!
- Fault. Second service.

18:15.202 --> 18:19.289
Hello. I'm Gail. What are your names?

18:19.832 --> 18:22.668
I'm Irina and this is Katya.

18:22.751 --> 18:23.794
Oh.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.963
That's very pretty.

18:26.588 --> 18:27.631
Are those Russian bears?

18:28.632 --> 18:30.926
No, they are Swiss bears.

18:31.009 --> 18:34.430
Our mummy and daddy bought them
at the bear garden in Bern.

18:34.888 --> 18:36.640
Is that your mummy over there?

18:38.350 --> 18:40.477
Our mummy and daddy are dead.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.272
I'm sorry.

18:47.985 --> 18:49.027
- Fuck!
- Yes!

18:49.194 --> 18:50.487
Watch your language.

18:50.904 --> 18:53.282
Game, set and match Great Britain.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.577
Next time you get Dad.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.413
You're a lousy tennis player, Professor.

18:59.496 --> 19:00.998
Yes, and so are you.

19:02.624 --> 19:04.376
- Oh, your wife.
- Oh, hey.

19:07.671 --> 19:11.300
What is a beautiful woman like you doing
with a lousy tennis player like this?

19:11.467 --> 19:12.968
- I've no idea.
- I'm Dima.

19:13.385 --> 19:14.428
I'm Gail.

19:15.345 --> 19:17.514
Meet my beautiful wife Tamara.

19:20.184 --> 19:21.268
It's lovely to meet you.

19:22.603 --> 19:24.897
Perry says that you are a famous lawyer.

19:25.272 --> 19:27.107
I'm definitely not famous.

19:27.274 --> 19:29.276
- What kind of law?
- I'm a barrister.

19:30.527 --> 19:31.778
Barrister?

19:33.030 --> 19:34.072
Yeah.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.826
Looks like you had
quite a bash last night.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.828
Yes. Yeah, I walked into a door.

19:40.204 --> 19:41.830
Stupid.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.081
You should have seen the door.

19:47.336 --> 19:49.296
It's my daughter Natasha's birthday today.

19:49.338 --> 19:51.757
Why don't you come to the villa
for a small party tonight?

19:52.883 --> 19:55.010
Well, that's very sweet,
but it's our last night.

19:55.135 --> 19:56.261
So we're gonna do something...

19:56.303 --> 19:57.387
Just a drink. Just a drink.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.723
I'll have a car pick you up
and take you back.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.185
It would make us very happy.

20:07.648 --> 20:09.441
This is a small party?

20:10.651 --> 20:13.153
We'll just stay
half an hour and leave, okay?

20:14.821 --> 20:16.198
Natasha, look.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.786
- Oh, my God.
- Happy birthday.

20:20.869 --> 20:22.329
Isn't he beautiful, huh?

20:22.621 --> 20:24.122
He's bought her a camel. Look.

20:25.791 --> 20:26.833
Look at the harness.

20:26.917 --> 20:30.545
- What's she gonna do with a camel?
- It was made in New York.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.924
Tanya! When did you come in?

20:36.843 --> 20:38.428
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

20:39.429 --> 20:40.931
You can meet Andrei.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.100
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

20:44.226 --> 20:45.310
So how old are you today?

20:46.144 --> 20:48.814
Eighteen, but my father still thinks
I'm a little girl.

20:52.484 --> 20:54.027
- Girls.
- Hey, hello.

20:54.111 --> 20:55.570
You look amazing.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.030
I'll get a drink. Do you want one?

20:57.114 --> 20:58.198
Uh... Yeah.

20:58.281 --> 20:59.533
I'll have a glass of champagne.

20:59.616 --> 21:00.867
Right.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.371
It's a great party.

21:06.248 --> 21:08.917
Can we play hide-and-seek?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.753
No, no, no, it's fine.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.714
Okay. One...

21:15.507 --> 21:17.968
Two, three...

21:18.885 --> 21:20.929
- Four...
- Do we just help ourselves?

21:21.012 --> 21:25.225
Five, six, seven...

21:26.309 --> 21:28.186
- Eight, nine...
- Hi, Perry. How are you?

21:28.270 --> 21:29.354
Hello. I'm good. Nice to see you.

21:29.396 --> 21:30.480
Ten!

21:30.981 --> 21:32.441
It's a lovely party.

21:48.749 --> 21:51.460
- Let me press it.
- No, no, no.

21:53.295 --> 21:54.796
Fire!

22:43.220 --> 22:44.721
Ah, Dima.

22:46.097 --> 22:48.141
You know what the Vory is, Professor?

22:48.225 --> 22:49.267
No.

22:50.101 --> 22:52.354
It's like mafia but with honour.

22:54.231 --> 22:55.941
I control accounts for the Vory

22:56.024 --> 22:58.443
because I'm good with money,
I'm very good.

23:00.278 --> 23:03.198
I had a friend, Misha, who worked for me.

23:03.865 --> 23:07.202
When the Vory became international,
they sent us to Europe.

23:08.036 --> 23:10.497
We washed money, make everyone rich.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.458
But that was under the old prince.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.626
He was a man of honour.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.878
He was like Misha, like me.

23:16.962 --> 23:20.298
But now his son, the new prince,
he's a traitor of traitors.

23:20.507 --> 23:25.470
He sold out the Vory to the state,
made a deal with the Kremlin.

23:25.553 --> 23:29.599
When the mafia cleans up its act,
it becomes legitimate

23:29.641 --> 23:32.394
and everybody makes money with each other.

23:32.477 --> 23:34.854
I'm not sure why
you're telling me this, Dima.

23:35.146 --> 23:38.400
Do you like these two little girls,
Katya and Irina?

23:38.608 --> 23:41.027
- The twins.
- Yeah, of course.

23:41.111 --> 23:43.488
Do you want to know
how their parents died?

23:45.615 --> 23:49.703
The new prince invited Misha, his wife
and their eldest daughter to Moscow,

23:49.786 --> 23:54.082
made him sign over the accounts that
he controlled and then had them killed.

23:56.710 --> 23:58.169
I'm like Misha.

23:59.754 --> 24:02.924
I'm a threat to the Prince.
I'm a threat to Kremlin.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.217
I know where the money comes from.

24:05.760 --> 24:06.970
They will kill me.

24:07.053 --> 24:10.265
They will kill my family too
if you don't help me.

24:10.598 --> 24:11.975
Help you? What can I do?

24:12.434 --> 24:18.606
When you go back to London,
give this to your MI6.

24:19.024 --> 24:21.317
At the airport
you tell them you have a gift

24:21.401 --> 24:24.738
from the number one money launderer
from the Russian mafia.

24:24.779 --> 24:26.740
Tell who? Dima, you've got the wrong guy.

24:26.823 --> 24:27.866
I have no one else.

24:27.949 --> 24:29.951
All these fuckers, the lawyers,

24:30.034 --> 24:32.787
the bankers and bodyguards,
they all work for the Prince.

24:32.871 --> 24:33.913
They watch me all the time.

24:33.997 --> 24:35.165
They listen to my phone calls.

24:35.248 --> 24:36.332
I have no one else.

25:01.316 --> 25:03.026
You have good time tonight?

25:04.360 --> 25:05.695
Fabulous.

25:07.197 --> 25:09.073
Look, we can walk from here.
Thanks for the lift.

25:17.957 --> 25:19.000
Gail!

25:22.253 --> 25:23.671
Go on, then.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.798
Where did you disappear with that girl?

25:25.882 --> 25:27.509
I saw you going into the villa with her.

25:27.592 --> 25:29.761
- I was talking with Dima.
- What about?

25:31.304 --> 25:32.597
He was showing me round his house.

25:32.722 --> 25:34.349
I'm not an idiot, Perry.

25:34.432 --> 25:36.100
Come on, Gail. Nothing happened.

25:36.184 --> 25:37.936
You were the one who wanted
to come on this trip.

25:38.311 --> 25:39.938
Yeah, 'cause I want things
to be like they were before.

25:40.021 --> 25:41.064
I want things to be better.

25:41.272 --> 25:44.400
Well, then why did we spend our last night
with a bunch of strangers?

25:45.568 --> 25:47.654
Well, you haven't exactly
been available yourself.

25:48.029 --> 25:49.322
Oh, fuck off.

26:08.633 --> 26:09.801
Next, please.

26:13.721 --> 26:14.806
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello.

26:16.599 --> 26:18.393
Welcome back.

26:18.476 --> 26:19.686
Thanks.

26:19.769 --> 26:21.020
Next, please.

26:23.940 --> 26:24.983
There's some problem with my passport.

26:25.066 --> 26:26.109
You should go on.

26:31.531 --> 26:33.533
- You all right?
- I'll catch up.

26:34.951 --> 26:36.286
Yeah.

26:46.087 --> 26:49.048
Excuse me. Can you tell me
how much longer this is going to take?

26:49.132 --> 26:50.717
Because I've been waiting for two hours.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.177
I'm afraid that's my fault,
Mrs McKendrick.

26:54.721 --> 26:56.097
If you'd like to follow me.

27:00.393 --> 27:02.145
I said I didn't want my wife involved.

27:02.603 --> 27:04.105
I'm sorry. Would you like her
to wait outside?

27:04.188 --> 27:05.606
Involved in what?

27:06.899 --> 27:08.735
I brought something over for Dima.

27:09.777 --> 27:10.820
What?

27:11.237 --> 27:12.488
I don't know.

27:15.408 --> 27:17.035
Perhaps you'd like to sit down.

27:23.332 --> 27:25.334
I have some questions.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.879
Not tough. Medium soft.

27:34.469 --> 27:35.803
Is this all he gave you?

27:36.804 --> 27:38.514
- Yeah.
- Didn't offer you any money?

27:38.598 --> 27:39.974
Oh, he did, but I refused.

27:41.350 --> 27:42.769
Then why did you bring it?

27:42.810 --> 27:45.146
I thought it was the right thing to do.

27:45.229 --> 27:46.981
He said that his children
would be killed if I didn't.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.107
You believed him?

27:50.068 --> 27:51.194
He seemed scared.

27:53.529 --> 27:56.115
He told you he was a member
of the Russian mafia.

27:57.617 --> 27:58.951
And you still agreed to help him.

28:02.497 --> 28:04.832
You haven't checked the contents
of the memory stick?

28:04.916 --> 28:07.001
No, no, I thought I could just hand it over
and be done with it.

28:07.084 --> 28:08.294
I thought that would be it, you know.

28:13.674 --> 28:15.009
Why do you think he chose you?

28:16.761 --> 28:18.304
I think he just took a punt.

28:25.686 --> 28:28.314
We may need to speak to you again
after we've checked the memory stick.

28:28.397 --> 28:32.777
In the meantime,
we'll need all your details.

28:33.402 --> 28:35.154
And we'll need you to sign this.

28:40.284 --> 28:41.494
Thanks.

29:17.071 --> 29:18.239
I couldn't say no to him.

29:18.906 --> 29:20.366
And why not?

29:20.449 --> 29:21.492
Mmm?

29:21.784 --> 29:23.327
I thought I could keep you out of it.

29:23.578 --> 29:25.955
Everything has consequences, Perry.

29:26.038 --> 29:28.249
You fuck one of your students,
there are consequences.

29:28.332 --> 29:31.168
You run errands for
a Russian mobster, same thing.

29:32.336 --> 29:35.214
Look, I'm sorry about everything.

29:45.766 --> 29:47.768
No sign of anyone following them.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.120
Did you have time to wade through
the material we bunged at you, Billy,

30:06.203 --> 30:08.414
or did it interfere with your golf?

30:08.497 --> 30:10.458
I can't stand fucking football.

30:11.375 --> 30:12.918
We're not going to the match.

30:27.349 --> 30:29.894
- Who authorised this?
- You did.

30:44.033 --> 30:46.077
Target headed for the Diamond Suite.

30:49.205 --> 30:50.748
Why am I here?

30:50.831 --> 30:53.959
We've had some intelligence
from a potential source,

30:54.001 --> 30:57.004
the principal money launderer
for the Russian mafia.

30:57.088 --> 30:58.464
Why didn't you mention this before?

30:58.547 --> 31:00.216
Because you wouldn't have come.

31:06.222 --> 31:08.349
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

31:13.437 --> 31:16.732
The man in the dark suit
is Nicolas Petrov, the Prince,

31:16.816 --> 31:18.859
a highly successful
and legitimate businessman,

31:18.943 --> 31:20.361
as far as the world's concerned.

31:20.736 --> 31:24.949
He's taken over the Russian
crime syndicate since his father died.

31:24.990 --> 31:28.410
Man next to him is his consigliere,
Emilio Del Oro.

31:30.037 --> 31:32.164
The Russian mafia
has nothing to do with us.

31:32.915 --> 31:33.999
Patience, Billy.

31:46.887 --> 31:48.013
Bushmaster's here.

31:48.264 --> 31:49.682
Thanks, Ollie.

31:49.765 --> 31:51.517
Our source wants to prove his worth.

31:51.934 --> 31:56.105
He's told us that the Prince is in London
to meet a prominent British politician.

31:56.146 --> 31:57.982
Who the hell's Bushmaster?

31:58.023 --> 32:00.442
A bushmaster is a breed of snake, Billy.

32:02.862 --> 32:03.904
Evening, sir.

32:05.155 --> 32:06.448
Our former boss.

32:08.409 --> 32:11.829
Current MP for Islington North
and head of the parliamentary subcommittee

32:11.912 --> 32:15.416
for trade and finance, Aubrey Longrigg.

32:15.499 --> 32:17.376
I can see who it is.

32:17.459 --> 32:18.836
- Aubrey.
- Hello.

32:19.169 --> 32:20.879
- What a pleasure.
- How are you?

32:21.088 --> 32:22.423
Nice to see you again, Emilio.

32:23.007 --> 32:24.425
My colleague, Mr Petrov.

32:24.508 --> 32:26.010
Mr Petrov, at last.

32:26.510 --> 32:29.346
- Are you a Tvarat fan?
- An Arsenal fan.

32:29.763 --> 32:30.931
An Arsenal fan?

32:31.015 --> 32:33.392
You can't condemn a man for
going to a football match.

32:33.601 --> 32:35.769
Not even if he's here to meet
the head of the Russian mafia?

32:35.853 --> 32:37.771
So far it's nothing more
than a coincidence.

32:37.855 --> 32:40.608
Well, according to our source,
the Prince is offering Longrigg

32:40.691 --> 32:42.860
a substantial sum of money.

32:42.943 --> 32:44.028
For what?

32:44.278 --> 32:49.074
Two days ago the Arena Bank of Cyprus,
a subsidiary of Petrov's empire,

32:49.158 --> 32:52.077
filed an application to establish
a trading bank in the city.

32:52.453 --> 32:54.121
The purpose of this bank?

32:54.163 --> 32:57.458
To launder billions of dollars of
Russian mafia money here in London.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.169
What does that have to do with Longrigg?

33:00.336 --> 33:02.629
The application was backed
by a distinguished list

33:02.713 --> 33:07.968
of British politicians, lawyers and bankers,
all recruited by our friend Aubrey.

33:08.594 --> 33:10.804
The game's about to start.
We should find our seats.

33:19.355 --> 33:20.397
Is that it?

33:21.023 --> 33:22.191
For now.

33:23.567 --> 33:26.445
I'm not getting involved
in your personal vendetta with Longrigg.

33:26.528 --> 33:27.654
It's more than my job's worth.

33:27.738 --> 33:29.239
There's nothing personal about it.

33:29.281 --> 33:30.908
The man's a traitor.

33:30.991 --> 33:33.577
He was corrupt when he was
in the service and he's corrupt now.

33:33.952 --> 33:35.162
He's working for the Russian mafia,

33:35.245 --> 33:38.791
and so are dozens of the most powerful
bankers and politicians in this country.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.501
You've no proof.

33:41.502 --> 33:44.004
Let me make the source an offer
and I'll get you the proof.

33:45.964 --> 33:50.219
Never before have we had an informant
this high up in Russian organised crime.

33:50.302 --> 33:52.805
You won't get another
opportunity like this, Billy.

33:55.307 --> 33:56.809
What does he want?

33:56.892 --> 33:58.227
Asylum for himself and his family.

33:58.310 --> 33:59.728
That's out of the question.

33:59.812 --> 34:02.189
The last thing the Foreign Office needs
is another row with Russia,

34:02.272 --> 34:04.566
and the Home Office doesn't
offer asylum to criminals.

34:04.691 --> 34:06.443
These men are betraying
their country, Billy.

34:06.527 --> 34:09.446
I'm sorry, Hector, I'm not going
after Longrigg or anybody else

34:09.530 --> 34:12.866
based on some Russian mobster's word.

34:15.619 --> 34:17.788
I don't like the cunt
any more than you do.

34:18.789 --> 34:20.916
But I'm protecting you from yourself.

34:24.378 --> 34:25.420
This stops now.

34:51.362 --> 34:52.406
What did Matlock say?

34:53.031 --> 34:54.074
He said we're on.

35:03.917 --> 35:06.086
"Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,

35:06.795 --> 35:10.090
"a crowd flowed over London Bridge,

35:10.173 --> 35:11.842
"so many,

35:12.217 --> 35:15.220
"I had not thought death
had undone so many,

35:16.054 --> 35:18.849
"sighs, short and infrequent,
were exhaled,

35:18.932 --> 35:21.226
"and each man fixed his eyes
before his feet."

35:21.310 --> 35:23.896
You see, Eliot is borrowing
from Dante's Inferno,

35:24.313 --> 35:28.817
drawing a parallel between his century
and the Florentine poet's vision of hell.

35:31.737 --> 35:35.282
Both writers, their societies
had become corrupt,

35:35.324 --> 35:36.867
and more than that, listless.

35:38.327 --> 35:42.331
And Eliot felt that 20th-century Britain

35:42.372 --> 35:43.790
was full of lost souls.

35:44.666 --> 35:46.835
There's nothing that links him
to the house on Tuesday

35:46.918 --> 35:49.421
and all of the forensic evidence
we can explain away

35:49.504 --> 35:51.923
because of their past... Relationship.

35:52.007 --> 35:54.217
Um, can I speak to you later
about this, please, Dolly?

35:54.301 --> 35:56.094
- Yes, of course.
- Great. Thank you.

35:57.512 --> 35:59.514
Well, this is a coincidence.

35:59.598 --> 36:00.807
Not exactly.

36:01.933 --> 36:03.685
I don't even know your name.

36:03.769 --> 36:04.811
Luke.

36:05.604 --> 36:07.898
I'm gonna bet that's not your real name.

36:07.981 --> 36:09.191
No?

36:11.151 --> 36:12.486
Shall we?

36:19.659 --> 36:21.787
I'm sorry to call you back like this,

36:21.870 --> 36:25.290
but we've had a chance to examine
the contents of the memory stick.

36:25.374 --> 36:30.420
Did Dima ever mention your involvement
in any future negotiations?

36:33.006 --> 36:34.091
What negotiations?

36:34.299 --> 36:36.968
He's asked to meet us in Paris.

36:37.052 --> 36:38.845
He wants you there when
we make contact with him.

36:39.262 --> 36:41.431
- Why?
- He doesn't trust us.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.266
Probably worried we'll get

36:43.308 --> 36:45.811
the information we need out of him
and feed him back to the wolves.

36:46.144 --> 36:48.355
- But he hardly knows me.
- He knew you well enough

36:48.438 --> 36:50.357
to know you'd pass on his message.

36:51.274 --> 36:53.276
Obviously thinks
you're a man of principle.

36:53.860 --> 36:55.362
I can't get involved.

36:57.906 --> 36:59.699
Well, I'm afraid you are involved.

37:00.492 --> 37:03.412
Trouble is, from the moment
you accepted the memory stick,

37:03.495 --> 37:06.915
he put his life and the lives
of his children in your hands.

37:06.998 --> 37:10.210
If his children are in danger,
it's his own fault.

37:11.378 --> 37:14.005
We have no obligation
whatsoever to this man.

37:31.606 --> 37:35.318
These are the parents
of the twins that you met.

37:42.450 --> 37:46.329
Oh, and this is the older sister, Anna.

37:46.997 --> 37:48.415
She was 17.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.002
You're a prick.

37:56.006 --> 37:57.757
Well, that's as may be.

37:57.966 --> 38:01.344
Believe me, I would rather not
have you mixed up in this either.

38:01.428 --> 38:05.765
Dima has a meeting in Bern next week where
he'll sign over the accounts he controls

38:05.849 --> 38:09.269
to the prince, just like
his old friend Misha did.

38:10.061 --> 38:13.356
After that, he and his family
will most likely be executed.

38:15.817 --> 38:20.280
Trouble is, he'll only deal
with us if you and Gail are there.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.118
He refuses to negotiate with us otherwise.

38:29.497 --> 38:31.875
He'll be working on the assumption
that if we betray him,

38:31.958 --> 38:34.544
you good people will stand up
for him and his family.

38:38.006 --> 38:39.299
He's making a lot of assumptions.

38:39.382 --> 38:40.967
What choice does he have?

38:41.426 --> 38:43.511
He's trying to protect
the people he loves.

38:57.859 --> 38:59.402
They're using you.

39:00.612 --> 39:02.113
Just like Dima.

39:03.073 --> 39:04.991
Well, it doesn't make it
any easier to say no.

39:05.075 --> 39:06.785
You don't even know these people.

39:06.868 --> 39:08.411
You don't know the people that you defend.

39:10.497 --> 39:14.501
And you do everything you can for them,
whether they're innocent or not.

39:19.005 --> 39:20.882
I can't stop thinking about him.

39:22.550 --> 39:24.761
His family, those kids.

39:25.679 --> 39:27.722
If something should happen to them...

39:36.064 --> 39:38.233
- May I ask you a question?
- Mmm-hmm.

39:38.566 --> 39:40.777
Does Bill Matlock know
we're using civilians?

39:41.861 --> 39:42.987
Yes.

40:01.798 --> 40:03.007
What are you working on?

40:03.383 --> 40:05.009
I'm reading about the Vory.

40:05.969 --> 40:07.762
That's what Dima is, isn't he?

40:09.347 --> 40:12.767
It describes how they recruit
people in jail.

40:12.851 --> 40:15.645
They look for people
who are disillusioned with their lives,

40:15.687 --> 40:19.774
people who've lost their way, and they
give them back their sense of purpose.

40:29.451 --> 40:32.996
Dima's attending a fashion show
with the prince at the Petit Palais.

40:34.831 --> 40:39.502
Your cover is you're there to see
an exhibition on a romantic weekend.

40:40.378 --> 40:43.798
Assuming he shows up,
let him approach you.

40:44.007 --> 40:47.719
When he does, look surprised,
then listen carefully

40:47.802 --> 40:49.387
to every word he says.

40:49.804 --> 40:51.347
Just be yourselves.

40:51.431 --> 40:55.393
If his companions question you,
stick to the truth as much as you can.

40:56.477 --> 40:58.021
It's always more convincing.

41:07.906 --> 41:09.449
Professor!

41:09.908 --> 41:11.534
What the fuck are you doing here?

41:12.243 --> 41:13.328
Dima.

41:13.411 --> 41:15.205
First I kiss your wife.

41:15.580 --> 41:16.664
Lovely to see you.

41:16.748 --> 41:19.292
Don't tell me he's taking you
to a fucking museum.

41:19.375 --> 41:20.543
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

41:20.835 --> 41:22.378
Dante Illustre.

41:22.462 --> 41:25.048
When you're in Paris, you should take
your wife shopping, you know?

41:25.131 --> 41:26.716
- What kind of man are you?
- What are you doing here?

41:26.799 --> 41:30.303
Well, I'm on my way to Bern, but my boss
wants to see the fashion show.

41:30.386 --> 41:31.971
And how are your gorgeous family?

41:32.055 --> 41:34.474
Oh, they're all good.
Natasha is here. Natasha.

41:35.683 --> 41:37.352
All the rest are in Switzerland.

41:37.602 --> 41:38.978
It's nice to see you again.

41:39.354 --> 41:40.939
Hey. How are you doing?

41:43.149 --> 41:45.568
Aren't you going to introduce
us to your friends, Dima?

41:45.610 --> 41:48.696
I'm Gail and this is my husband Perry.

41:48.780 --> 41:50.406
- Hey.
- Emilio Del Oro.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.408
How do you know Dima?

41:52.492 --> 41:53.868
Oh, we met on holiday.

41:55.912 --> 41:57.622
How do you feel about Paris?

41:57.789 --> 41:59.415
How long are you gonna stay?

41:59.582 --> 42:01.501
How long are you in town for?

42:02.001 --> 42:03.836
Oh, we leave the day after tomorrow.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.088
Okay, so tomorrow we play tennis.

42:05.171 --> 42:06.339
I'll beat the shit out of you.

42:15.682 --> 42:17.475
Anything else that stood out?

42:18.267 --> 42:21.437
Just the tennis.
12:00 at the Club des Rois.

42:21.521 --> 42:24.941
Well, he also said, "I'll buy you
a massage after I beat you."

42:25.024 --> 42:26.150
Yeah.

42:32.115 --> 42:33.282
You okay to go?

42:35.618 --> 42:37.036
Do we have a choice?

42:37.120 --> 42:40.081
We'll make contact tomorrow
and it'll be over, I promise.

42:42.583 --> 42:43.668
Ah, okay.

42:49.882 --> 42:50.925
Uh...

42:51.300 --> 42:55.555
Mondays, the resident masseurs
at the Club des Rois have the day off.

42:55.638 --> 42:57.515
They only come in by appointment.

42:57.890 --> 42:59.392
Clever bastard.

43:51.402 --> 43:53.196
- Good morning.
- Morning.

44:02.914 --> 44:04.999
Too early for a glass of champagne?

44:05.124 --> 44:06.417
Never too early for me.

44:06.751 --> 44:08.252
Professor!

44:12.840 --> 44:16.219
Good to see you.
Gail, you beautiful woman.

44:17.762 --> 44:19.138
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

44:19.555 --> 44:21.307
I've got clothes for you.

44:23.643 --> 44:26.729
Gail, you look after my Natasha, huh?

44:27.230 --> 44:28.648
Yeah, of course.

44:29.774 --> 44:31.567
- I'll bring it over.
- Thanks.

44:35.029 --> 44:36.364
Nice to see you again.

44:36.489 --> 44:37.615
There you go.

44:37.698 --> 44:39.200
- Right.
- This way.

44:56.258 --> 44:58.094
- I've never been here before.
- Oh, really?

44:58.177 --> 44:59.512
- Shall we have a seat?
- Yeah.

45:03.891 --> 45:05.935
Did you have a good night, Professor?

45:07.269 --> 45:08.646
Great. And yours?

45:10.606 --> 45:11.816
Shit.

45:39.468 --> 45:40.636
Okay.

46:02.950 --> 46:04.452
After you.

46:13.627 --> 46:15.129
It's good to meet you.

46:18.257 --> 46:21.594
I need some of your famous
fucking British fair play.

46:23.304 --> 46:26.724
First of all we have to decide
if what you have to offer is worthwhile.

46:27.099 --> 46:28.851
My information is good.

46:34.231 --> 46:36.150
My papa just told me about it.

46:36.942 --> 46:39.737
- But you've been to Paris before?
- Yes.

46:39.820 --> 46:41.447
- And you?
- Ah, yeah.

46:41.530 --> 46:43.032
- I've been to Paris before.
- Time's up.

46:43.824 --> 46:44.909
Gotta go.

47:03.302 --> 47:04.970
Hello, boys.

47:45.886 --> 47:48.389
Ah. Fuck.

48:01.235 --> 48:03.654
Names, addresses.

48:04.822 --> 48:06.448
Bankers, politicians.

48:06.824 --> 48:08.158
Names and addresses.

48:14.331 --> 48:15.624
No account numbers.

48:20.546 --> 48:22.131
Nothing we can't find in the phone book.

48:22.506 --> 48:24.758
An extraordinary list of names, though.

48:24.925 --> 48:26.260
It's no good to us so far.

48:26.510 --> 48:27.845
Are you all right?

48:55.414 --> 48:57.541
You've stopped breathing, Professor.

48:58.584 --> 49:00.085
Calm.

49:05.174 --> 49:07.301
You'll have a heart attack.

49:11.221 --> 49:14.016
A list of names and personal
information isn't enough.

49:14.391 --> 49:17.519
I need proof that all these people
are being paid by the Prince.

49:18.437 --> 49:21.482
You get my family to England,
I'll tell you everything.

49:21.982 --> 49:23.817
You cooperate or there'll be no deal.

49:23.901 --> 49:26.278
You give that list to your bosses
and see what they say.

49:26.361 --> 49:28.363
I know what it's worth.

49:28.447 --> 49:29.656
I want UK passports.

49:29.740 --> 49:32.159
I want 24-hour protection for my family.

49:33.827 --> 49:38.248
How much are these people being guaranteed
if the Arena Bank gets its licence in London?

49:38.791 --> 49:39.958
£5 million each.

49:42.628 --> 49:43.754
And Aubrey Longrigg?

49:44.254 --> 49:45.506
£10 million on signature.

49:45.589 --> 49:48.133
Another £10 million
on first day of trading.

49:48.175 --> 49:50.385
All paid to a secret account
in Switzerland.

49:50.469 --> 49:51.637
I need their account numbers.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.889
Bankers, politicians, all of them.

49:53.972 --> 49:56.058
I don't have them until after Bern.

49:57.226 --> 49:58.477
I make the payments to them

49:58.560 --> 50:02.689
at the same time I sign over the accounts
that I control to the Arena Bank.

50:02.773 --> 50:05.859
Well, then, I'm afraid I can't do anything
for you or your family until then.

50:05.943 --> 50:07.319
Why can't you get them out now?

50:07.402 --> 50:08.445
This doesn't concern you.

50:10.489 --> 50:12.241
It's okay, Professor.

50:12.282 --> 50:14.243
When does the signing take place?

50:14.493 --> 50:17.579
Wednesday at 10:00
at the Allied Bank in Bern.

50:18.121 --> 50:21.166
After that, the prince will have
a reception at the Bellevue Hotel.

50:21.792 --> 50:24.419
You get me their account numbers,
we'll find a way to smuggle you out.

50:24.628 --> 50:25.837
I don't give a fuck what happens to me.

50:25.921 --> 50:27.089
I want my family safe.

50:27.130 --> 50:28.215
We will try to take care of them, too.

50:28.298 --> 50:29.383
I give you my word.

50:29.466 --> 50:31.260
I don't trust your fucking word.

50:38.016 --> 50:40.936
Well, then, it's the end
of the conversation.

50:43.647 --> 50:46.566
Okay. I'll go with the prince to Bern.

50:46.650 --> 50:48.318
I'll get the fucking numbers.

50:51.989 --> 50:54.366
- Where do you live in London?
- Chelsea.

50:54.449 --> 50:56.493
- Are you happy?
- In Chelsea?

50:57.286 --> 50:58.662
With your husband?

51:00.998 --> 51:02.666
That's a very direct question.

51:04.376 --> 51:07.129
I'm curious why a couple
who've been married 10 years

51:07.170 --> 51:10.340
would take two romantic holidays
in the space of a month.

51:56.386 --> 51:58.305
Where is he taking us?

52:00.724 --> 52:01.975
Why are we going on the motorway?

52:02.476 --> 52:04.436
I have to drop something for a friend.

52:04.770 --> 52:06.354
It's okay, it's on the way.

52:30.545 --> 52:31.838
We need to get to our hotel.

52:31.922 --> 52:33.089
Just a few minutes.

52:48.063 --> 52:49.606
What happened in there?

52:49.856 --> 52:52.859
He gave him another memory stick,
but it didn't seem to be enough.

52:53.693 --> 52:56.154
They used his children's lives
to bargain with him.

52:57.656 --> 52:59.658
I just stood there and said nothing.

53:00.909 --> 53:02.077
Well, what could you say?

53:07.624 --> 53:10.335
I have to wait for her.
I'm sorry, Professor.

53:10.544 --> 53:12.003
Well, how long is she gonna be?

53:12.087 --> 53:13.421
Ah, 15 minutes.

53:14.130 --> 53:15.257
Get us a taxi.

53:15.340 --> 53:17.008
No, taxi take longer.

53:17.092 --> 53:19.427
Come inside. We'll leave
as soon as she comes.

53:19.511 --> 53:21.012
It's not safe here.

53:51.501 --> 53:52.836
My friend comes soon. Have some tea.

53:53.837 --> 53:56.089
Come, come, come. Sit, sit, sit.

54:02.387 --> 54:03.596
No, thanks.

54:05.348 --> 54:06.725
Thank you.

54:16.901 --> 54:18.862
It's funny you here in Paris.

54:20.238 --> 54:21.573
Why is it funny?

54:21.823 --> 54:23.658
You, me, Dima.

54:24.409 --> 54:25.827
It's like Morocco.

54:26.286 --> 54:28.079
It was sunnier in Morocco.

54:33.960 --> 54:36.796
Oh, no, merci.

54:40.842 --> 54:41.926
No, thanks.

54:53.480 --> 54:54.773
Who you work for, Professor?

54:55.482 --> 54:57.484
I teach at a London university.

54:59.527 --> 55:01.529
Maybe I come visit you in London,

55:02.363 --> 55:04.741
visit your house, we go
to football match together.

55:17.378 --> 55:19.089
Stop! Fucking prick.

55:19.172 --> 55:20.757
- You fucking prick!
- It's okay. It's okay.

55:20.840 --> 55:22.300
It's not okay. What kind of guy does that?

55:22.383 --> 55:23.468
You feel like a big man?

55:23.551 --> 55:24.677
Feel like a big guy now, do you?

55:24.761 --> 55:26.638
A big fucking strong guy? Fucking idiot.

55:26.763 --> 55:28.681
- She needs a doctor.
- We'll look after her.

55:28.765 --> 55:29.974
What are you doing?

55:30.058 --> 55:31.184
Calling an ambulance is what I'm doing.

55:31.267 --> 55:32.393
It's okay.

55:32.477 --> 55:35.313
- It's okay. I call doctor.
- Yeah?

55:35.480 --> 55:37.941
- It's all right.
- Do it, then. Do it now.

56:18.273 --> 56:22.193
You lied to Dima, you lied
to them and you lied to me.

56:22.819 --> 56:25.446
Bill Matlock has no idea
we're here, does he?

56:26.197 --> 56:29.784
If you're concerned about your career,
you can always go back to counterterrorism.

56:30.326 --> 56:31.536
Fuck you.

56:31.619 --> 56:34.080
Once we have those account numbers,
London may listen to us.

56:34.163 --> 56:35.748
Until then, they won't.

56:47.343 --> 56:48.386
You okay?

56:49.721 --> 56:51.264
No, we're not okay.

56:52.348 --> 56:55.935
A car will come to meet you off the Eurostar
at St Pancras and take you home.

56:56.019 --> 56:57.312
When will the family arrive in England?

57:01.190 --> 57:04.694
Well, Dima's signing in Bern
is next Wednesday morning.

57:07.488 --> 57:08.698
What's the matter?

57:16.247 --> 57:18.625
We don't know when we can
get the family out.

57:18.791 --> 57:20.543
Why not?

57:20.585 --> 57:22.378
Because the operation
hasn't been sanctioned.

57:22.754 --> 57:23.880
What does that mean?

57:23.963 --> 57:27.091
It means that once we get Dima
back to the UK,

57:27.175 --> 57:28.301
I'll be able to make a case
for the family.

57:28.509 --> 57:29.719
They'll kill them.

57:32.388 --> 57:35.141
We don't have the people or the resources
to smuggle them all out.

57:35.266 --> 57:36.684
Getting his family out is all he wants.

57:36.768 --> 57:38.269
That's all that matters to him.

57:38.353 --> 57:40.104
Dima hasn't given me enough
to bargain with.

57:40.313 --> 57:42.065
Our own authorities won't accept them...

57:42.148 --> 57:44.192
- They're children.
- They're his children.

57:51.532 --> 57:52.950
How many people do you have?

57:54.535 --> 57:55.912
Just the three of us.

57:59.999 --> 58:01.542
And how many would you need?

58:05.338 --> 58:08.966
If you leave his family behind, do you think
he's gonna give you those account numbers?

58:35.660 --> 58:36.994
May I sit down?

58:37.787 --> 58:38.830
Yeah.

58:42.291 --> 58:44.669
Have you ever read any Kolakowski?

58:44.710 --> 58:46.587
He's a Polish philosopher.

58:46.629 --> 58:49.799
Very stern views on good
and evil, which I share.

58:52.426 --> 58:57.056
Evil is evil, not rooted
in a social circumstance.

58:58.141 --> 58:59.851
Not about being deprived.

59:01.060 --> 59:02.728
Not even controlled by God.

59:02.812 --> 59:05.523
It's an entirely separate human force.

59:13.948 --> 59:15.366
I have a son.

59:17.493 --> 59:19.495
He's in jail for selling drugs.

59:22.081 --> 59:26.002
I believe Aubrey Longrigg, who was
my boss before he went into politics,

59:27.378 --> 59:31.799
tipped off the police to discredit me
when I was making trouble for him at MI6.

59:35.094 --> 59:37.305
It's not the reason
I'm doing this, but, um...

59:38.723 --> 59:41.058
I want you to know
that I have children, too.

59:46.731 --> 59:49.150
I'll do everything I can for the family.

01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:32.443
Papa, museums are boring.

01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:35.821
Especially Einstein and maths.

01:00:35.905 --> 01:00:38.240
Do you know what Einstein himself said?

01:00:38.324 --> 01:00:40.534
You think you've got problems
with arithmetic?

01:00:40.618 --> 01:00:42.578
I've got more fucking problems.

01:00:42.662 --> 01:00:45.748
Your mother and your sister
want to go. End of story.

01:00:46.999 --> 01:00:49.001
Come on, let's go, assholes.

01:01:41.053 --> 01:01:43.472
You have to sign twice
for each numbered account.

01:01:43.973 --> 01:01:45.099
Here

01:01:46.183 --> 01:01:47.476
and here.

01:01:58.404 --> 01:02:03.450
Ladies and gentlemen, you each need to
countersign for your individual accounts.

01:02:04.994 --> 01:02:07.496
The funds will then be transferred.

01:02:41.655 --> 01:02:44.825
This is the Bern telephone
conferencing centre.

01:02:44.992 --> 01:02:47.703
Please enter your four-digit passcode.

01:02:51.206 --> 01:02:52.374
Morning, boys and girls.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:56.420
I'll cue you when I see Dima's party
on the way to the Bellevue Hotel.

01:02:56.503 --> 01:02:58.130
No one to move until then.

01:03:07.348 --> 01:03:10.351
This... Pen doesn't work.

01:03:19.485 --> 01:03:20.986
Ah, thank you.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.753
One last signature here transferring
all remaining funds to the Arena Bank.

01:04:09.201 --> 01:04:11.954
The only time my father ever hit me...

01:04:11.995 --> 01:04:13.747
I remember that story.

01:04:15.165 --> 01:04:18.961
I also remember when you were
a little child, Kolya,

01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:23.424
and your father and I took you hunting.

01:04:23.674 --> 01:04:27.970
You were 12, maybe 13 years old
and you were so excited.

01:04:28.011 --> 01:04:29.972
You couldn't wait to kill something.

01:04:31.223 --> 01:04:35.060
And then we saw this buck
and you raised the rifle,

01:04:35.144 --> 01:04:38.439
but the buck just looked at you,
kept on grazing.

01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:41.150
It wasn't afraid.

01:04:42.609 --> 01:04:47.281
You tried and tried to pull
that trigger, but you couldn't.

01:04:48.365 --> 01:04:50.576
So you started crying like a little girl.

01:04:54.872 --> 01:04:58.333
So I had to take the rifle
and kill it for you.

01:05:12.556 --> 01:05:13.974
Papa's on the move.

01:05:14.933 --> 01:05:17.019
They'll be with you shortly
at the Bellevue.

01:05:17.186 --> 01:05:19.354
Luke, make sure he sees you in the lobby.

01:05:19.438 --> 01:05:20.689
Perry, wait for them in the car.

01:05:20.772 --> 01:05:23.901
If Dima asks how his family are,
tell him they're safe even if they're not.

01:05:23.984 --> 01:05:25.736
You're there to reassure him.

01:05:29.323 --> 01:05:31.491
Ollie, Gail, you're good to go.

01:05:50.677 --> 01:05:54.723
...to link acoustically
or otherwise commutable signs

01:05:54.806 --> 01:05:56.558
to sense-impressions.

01:05:58.143 --> 01:06:01.063
Most likely, all sociable animals

01:06:01.772 --> 01:06:05.943
have arrived at this primitive
kind of communication,

01:06:06.526 --> 01:06:08.236
at least to a certain degree.

01:06:39.893 --> 01:06:40.936
Green to go.

01:06:43.855 --> 01:06:45.857
By the end of the week,

01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:49.611
we will have our licence
and begin trading in London.

01:06:50.404 --> 01:06:53.281
To the future of the Arena Bank.

01:06:53.657 --> 01:06:55.409
Arena Bank.

01:06:59.329 --> 01:07:03.333
To all my friends who have
made this possible...

01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:07.087
I say thank you.

01:07:07.629 --> 01:07:12.884
We Russians have had
a mixed reputation in Europe recently.

01:07:14.136 --> 01:07:17.639
But... But for all the disagreements

01:07:17.848 --> 01:07:22.853
and suspicions of recent times,
I believe Russia's economic strength...

01:07:23.603 --> 01:07:27.107
...furthermore, the equation E is equal

01:07:27.149 --> 01:07:29.109
MC squared,

01:07:29.443 --> 01:07:32.612
shows that a very small amount of mass...

01:07:33.947 --> 01:07:37.367
...may be converted into a very large
amount of energy.

01:07:40.787 --> 01:07:42.873
Quickly. Come on.

01:08:00.223 --> 01:08:01.266
Come on, quick as you can.

01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:02.392
Where's your mother?

01:08:10.233 --> 01:08:12.444
That's it, get up there. In you get.

01:08:15.947 --> 01:08:19.533
There's no new Cold War.

01:08:20.118 --> 01:08:22.621
You have welcomed us with open arms...

01:08:24.581 --> 01:08:26.957
And you will find us committed partners.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.252
Family secure.

01:08:54.694 --> 01:08:56.947
What the fuck do you want, you shit ants?

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.407
I'm going for a pee. Fuck off!

01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:07.999
Dima's heading for the kitchen,
but I can't follow him.

01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:10.669
Too many bodyguards.

01:09:10.752 --> 01:09:12.837
It's impossible for me
to lead him to Perry.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.716
We need to get him out before
they realise his family is missing.

01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:33.710
Ahhh!

01:10:43.803 --> 01:10:45.388
Dima. Dima.

01:10:45.555 --> 01:10:47.640
Dima, stop. Fucking stop.

01:10:50.518 --> 01:10:51.644
Professor.

01:10:51.728 --> 01:10:53.563
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:10:53.646 --> 01:10:54.981
We have to go.

01:10:56.232 --> 01:10:57.442
I've got Dima.

01:10:57.567 --> 01:10:58.902
Luke, get the car to the side entrance.

01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:09.579
Are my kids safe?

01:11:10.371 --> 01:11:12.457
They're fine. They're on their way.

01:11:28.389 --> 01:11:29.724
Any news?

01:11:30.725 --> 01:11:33.436
Well, if you can't give me the answer,
get me the fucking minister.

01:11:45.323 --> 01:11:46.616
- Hello, boys!
- Papa!

01:11:48.368 --> 01:11:50.036
We're going to London!

01:11:50.745 --> 01:11:51.955
- You all right?
- Hey!

01:11:52.163 --> 01:11:54.749
- Look at my girls. Wow!
- Yeah, yeah, Dima!

01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.210
Ah, Natasha.

01:11:57.293 --> 01:11:58.878
- We did good.
- Good. Well done.

01:11:58.962 --> 01:12:00.588
- Thanks.
- Right, let's get going.

01:12:12.058 --> 01:12:13.476
Hello?

01:12:15.812 --> 01:12:18.481
I can't hear you, Billy.
You'll have to speak up.

01:12:25.113 --> 01:12:27.407
I chartered the plane myself, Billy.

01:12:27.782 --> 01:12:29.075
You owe me £6,000.

01:12:30.827 --> 01:12:31.869
What?

01:12:40.753 --> 01:12:42.755
What is it? What's the matter?

01:12:44.757 --> 01:12:46.926
There's been a hold-up,
but there's nothing to worry about.

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.469
Don't you fucking lie to me.

01:12:52.724 --> 01:12:57.186
Longrigg convinced the Home Office
to deny you and your family entry.

01:12:57.895 --> 01:12:59.063
And what can you do about it?

01:12:59.605 --> 01:13:01.649
Go back to London and change their minds.

01:13:01.941 --> 01:13:03.192
I'll need those account numbers.

01:13:03.276 --> 01:13:04.360
Fuck you.

01:13:04.444 --> 01:13:05.695
It'll help me make a case.

01:13:06.237 --> 01:13:09.532
You get my family to London,
I'll give you those numbers.

01:13:18.416 --> 01:13:20.585
You should come back on the plane with me.

01:13:20.668 --> 01:13:23.046
No. We're staying with them.

01:13:26.799 --> 01:13:29.218
I can't guarantee your safety.
They'll be coming after you.

01:13:29.427 --> 01:13:30.887
Then you'd better hurry.

01:13:37.059 --> 01:13:39.020
I knew I couldn't trust this guy.

01:13:42.064 --> 01:13:44.275
Change cars. Get them across the border.

01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:46.152
Head for Pralognan.

01:13:46.235 --> 01:13:47.653
There's a safe house near there.

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.274
You went behind my back.

01:14:25.358 --> 01:14:27.109
- What do you expect?
- Your support.

01:14:27.193 --> 01:14:29.237
Get off your fucking high horse, Hector.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.322
You're lucky I'm even considering this.

01:14:31.447 --> 01:14:34.659
If Longrigg has got a scent of something,
we need to act quickly.

01:14:34.742 --> 01:14:36.202
It isn't just Longrigg.

01:14:36.285 --> 01:14:37.912
You know how delicate
relations are with Russia.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:40.998
If their Foreign Minister picks up the phone
about this, we can't ignore him.

01:14:41.082 --> 01:14:43.000
What, so we're still taking
orders from the Kremlin?

01:14:44.418 --> 01:14:45.795
Where are you hiding them?

01:14:50.383 --> 01:14:52.093
We have a meeting
with the secretary tomorrow.

01:14:53.052 --> 01:14:56.138
You'd better convince him what Dima
has to offer is worth the grief.

01:15:57.908 --> 01:15:58.993
Hector.

01:16:04.248 --> 01:16:05.666
You look ravishing.

01:16:27.605 --> 01:16:29.648
It's really noisy.

01:16:31.734 --> 01:16:33.569
Time for bed, my sweet.

01:16:33.694 --> 01:16:35.071
Come on. I'll read to you.

01:16:35.362 --> 01:16:37.198
Don't worry. I won't be long.

01:16:38.157 --> 01:16:40.201
I assume this isn't a social visit.

01:16:40.284 --> 01:16:41.702
No, actually.

01:16:42.661 --> 01:16:47.208
You betrayed the service, Aubrey,
and now you've betrayed your country,

01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:50.878
and I'm gonna hang you up by your fucking
balls if it's the last thing I do.

01:16:51.212 --> 01:16:53.339
Have we not had this conversation before?

01:16:53.422 --> 01:16:56.884
It didn't turn out quite as you expected
as far as I remember.

01:16:58.302 --> 01:17:00.471
How is your son, by the way?

01:17:01.847 --> 01:17:04.141
Not as well as your beautiful family.

01:17:05.601 --> 01:17:07.186
Keep swinging, Hector.

01:17:07.728 --> 01:17:09.188
I'll leave that to the prince.

01:17:14.693 --> 01:17:18.447
I'm going to make sure that your plan
to help your Russian friends

01:17:18.531 --> 01:17:20.991
doesn't go as smoothly as they expect.

01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:24.203
And then I'll watch them fuck you up.

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.126
Thank you.

01:17:49.603 --> 01:17:50.813
Andrei?

01:17:52.022 --> 01:17:53.148
Yes.

01:17:55.985 --> 01:17:58.070
I tried to call you so many times.

01:17:58.404 --> 01:17:59.905
Are you okay?

01:18:01.073 --> 01:18:02.575
No, I'm not.

01:18:02.658 --> 01:18:05.869
Everything will be okay.
I'll look after you.

01:18:08.581 --> 01:18:12.251
I don't know what to do.
I can't bear this any longer.

01:18:15.045 --> 01:18:16.797
Just tell me where you are.

01:18:17.631 --> 01:18:18.966
I can't.

01:18:22.136 --> 01:18:23.804
Then talk to me.

01:18:25.306 --> 01:18:26.557
I love you.

01:18:37.526 --> 01:18:40.487
If the committee will allow me
to fly the asset and his family

01:18:40.571 --> 01:18:43.866
here to the UK,
I can prove that Aubrey Longrigg

01:18:43.949 --> 01:18:46.577
and these other traitors
are being paid between five

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.288
and 20 million pounds each
for their support.

01:18:50.205 --> 01:18:54.043
Mr Secretary,
the Arena Bank is not Russian,

01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:57.796
it's not subject to sanctions,
and on top of that

01:18:57.838 --> 01:19:01.091
it's proposing to put billions
into the City of London.

01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:04.428
If we investigate them
based on the testimony

01:19:04.511 --> 01:19:07.639
of a self-confessed criminal,
they'll simply take their money elsewhere.

01:19:07.723 --> 01:19:10.184
A man launders a million pounds,
he's a crook,

01:19:10.309 --> 01:19:12.561
but a few billion, now you're talking.

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.022
Money has no smell as long
as there's enough of it.

01:19:15.105 --> 01:19:17.524
Who cares what the Russians do
as long as they spend their cash here?

01:19:17.608 --> 01:19:19.068
There's really no need to be
quite so emotional.

01:19:19.151 --> 01:19:20.277
You're right, Mr Secretary.

01:19:20.402 --> 01:19:21.653
We've all seen too much of the world.

01:19:21.737 --> 01:19:23.530
Not wanking around, eh?

01:19:23.655 --> 01:19:25.824
And all the dirty money
that's sloshing around,

01:19:25.908 --> 01:19:29.870
the profits of heartache and pain,
we've seen that, too.

01:19:29.995 --> 01:19:31.997
Heroin in Afghanistan, billions.

01:19:32.206 --> 01:19:35.084
Arms in the Sudan, billions.
Female trafficking, billions.

01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:38.045
An eighth of the world's
fucking economy black as black.

01:19:38.128 --> 01:19:39.379
We all know that.

01:19:40.589 --> 01:19:42.007
Blood money.

01:19:42.132 --> 01:19:43.467
That's all it is.

01:19:45.511 --> 01:19:49.431
It can be in a box under a drug lord's bed
or in a city bank next to the vintage port.

01:19:49.515 --> 01:19:51.975
It doesn't change colour.
It's still blood money.

01:20:01.235 --> 01:20:02.361
Help!

01:20:02.569 --> 01:20:04.571
I'm a nice old bear!

01:20:09.076 --> 01:20:10.119
Oh, no!

01:20:14.081 --> 01:20:15.332
Hey, don't tickle me!

01:20:16.667 --> 01:20:18.794
Don't tickle me. Don't tickle me.

01:20:19.628 --> 01:20:21.922
Don't tickle me! Don't tickle me!

01:20:25.551 --> 01:20:26.718
Hello?

01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:31.181
We're fine. How did it go?

01:20:39.439 --> 01:20:40.774
Just a sec.

01:20:43.151 --> 01:20:44.278
Perry?

01:20:44.403 --> 01:20:45.654
It's Hector.

01:20:46.738 --> 01:20:48.365
He wants a word.

01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:05.632
They want me to go alone.

01:21:06.717 --> 01:21:08.427
They want you to go ahead.

01:21:09.511 --> 01:21:11.430
They're gonna send
a helicopter to pick you up.

01:21:11.555 --> 01:21:13.849
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.

01:21:13.932 --> 01:21:15.058
And my family?

01:21:18.478 --> 01:21:20.022
They'll follow in a few days.

01:21:25.611 --> 01:21:26.737
You believe them?

01:21:31.033 --> 01:21:32.868
Hector seems confident.

01:21:42.252 --> 01:21:44.463
I've fucked up your life, Professor.

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:46.965
Why are you still here?

01:21:48.425 --> 01:21:49.801
I've no idea.

01:21:58.894 --> 01:22:00.520
Why did you choose me?

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.649
There was no one else in the restaurant.

01:22:09.404 --> 01:22:13.325
I was lucky to pick the only guy
in the world crazy enough to help me.

01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:18.914
You're a good man, Professor.

01:22:21.666 --> 01:22:23.168
A man with honour.

01:22:28.423 --> 01:22:30.509
Will you and Gail look after
Tamara and the kids?

01:22:31.551 --> 01:22:34.221
- Of course.
- She's a good woman, Gail.

01:22:34.888 --> 01:22:37.599
Keep her. You're lucky.

01:22:38.725 --> 01:22:41.186
It's the only thing
that matters, you know.

01:22:41.269 --> 01:22:44.523
All the rest is... The rest is bullshit.

01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:51.655
We'll play tennis in London.

01:22:56.952 --> 01:22:59.663
Wimbledon.

01:23:15.303 --> 01:23:17.889
Is there room for two?

01:23:18.682 --> 01:23:21.143
Let me see what I can do.

01:23:24.396 --> 01:23:26.773
What are you thinking about, hmm?

01:23:30.777 --> 01:23:33.238
I'm just thinking about Dima
and the family.

01:23:34.739 --> 01:23:36.616
I really thought that
I could make a difference.

01:23:37.617 --> 01:23:38.994
You have.

01:23:39.703 --> 01:23:40.871
Yeah.

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:43.415
When he asked for your help,

01:23:43.623 --> 01:23:48.003
I don't think he imagined in his wildest
dreams how far you'd go for him.

01:23:49.838 --> 01:23:52.507
You know, I'm almost jealous.

01:23:54.009 --> 01:23:57.679
Maybe we're better at looking after
other people than each other.

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.442
No, we're not.

01:24:29.419 --> 01:24:30.837
What's the matter?

01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:32.714
Nothing.

01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:38.261
Don't lie to me.

01:24:39.679 --> 01:24:40.972
What's wrong?

01:24:44.643 --> 01:24:46.019
I love him.

01:24:51.024 --> 01:24:52.609
Who do you love?

01:24:55.278 --> 01:24:56.404
Andrei.

01:24:57.113 --> 01:24:58.823
I want to be with him.

01:25:02.577 --> 01:25:04.079
Don't fucking say that.

01:25:04.204 --> 01:25:06.748
- But it's true.
- Don't fucking say that.

01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:09.709
I am pregnant.

01:25:12.045 --> 01:25:14.798
I'm gonna kill him!
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

01:25:17.175 --> 01:25:19.010
You can't kill him.

01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:24.516
You can't even protect us.

01:25:48.289 --> 01:25:49.791
It's okay, Katya.

01:25:58.258 --> 01:25:59.384
Professor.

01:25:59.884 --> 01:26:02.053
- You know how to use this?
- No.

01:26:03.221 --> 01:26:04.639
There's no safety.

01:26:04.722 --> 01:26:07.684
Easy. Poof, poof, poof. And they're dead.

01:26:14.065 --> 01:26:15.525
Fuck...

01:26:23.408 --> 01:26:25.577
Danny, let him go, see where he goes.

01:26:28.288 --> 01:26:29.956
Shh. I've got you. I've got you.

01:26:34.919 --> 01:26:36.462
Attack, attack.

01:26:53.438 --> 01:26:55.148
Ollie. I'll take the north side.

01:27:07.785 --> 01:27:10.163
Luke! Three coming down the hill!

01:27:10.246 --> 01:27:11.331
Danny!

01:27:49.035 --> 01:27:50.536
Stay here.

01:27:53.164 --> 01:27:54.791
Perry? Perry!

01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:08.221
Oh, fuck.

01:28:12.517 --> 01:28:13.935
- Perry?
- Luke?

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.729
- Over here.
- Are you all right?

01:28:18.064 --> 01:28:19.816
We got two of them.

01:28:22.151 --> 01:28:23.236
Are you hurt?

01:28:23.319 --> 01:28:24.946
I'll be fine. Just my shoulder.

01:28:26.489 --> 01:28:27.657
Where's Dima?

01:28:29.117 --> 01:28:31.285
He followed the last guy into the woods.

01:28:31.369 --> 01:28:32.578
Right.

01:28:32.829 --> 01:28:34.831
Perry, stay here.

01:28:35.623 --> 01:28:36.749
Perry.

01:30:11.302 --> 01:30:13.054
I will not take that helicopter.

01:30:13.137 --> 01:30:14.680
I'll go with the family.

01:30:15.806 --> 01:30:17.558
Your family will be safe.

01:30:18.517 --> 01:30:20.811
Ollie's moving them to a secure location.

01:30:21.312 --> 01:30:22.855
Ollie said this was secure.

01:30:23.856 --> 01:30:25.733
Can't even protect yourself.

01:30:27.526 --> 01:30:30.488
The best way to protect them
is to come with me to England.

01:30:30.571 --> 01:30:31.822
This is your only chance.

01:30:32.156 --> 01:30:33.366
Fuck you.

01:30:46.504 --> 01:30:47.838
I could go with you.

01:30:59.392 --> 01:31:00.977
See you in a couple of days.

01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:04.689
Papa.

01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:11.862
We'll talk later, okay?

01:31:12.697 --> 01:31:14.073
Bye.

01:32:28.439 --> 01:32:29.523
I'll go alone.

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.025
What?

01:32:31.567 --> 01:32:32.860
I don't want you to come.

01:32:34.278 --> 01:32:35.946
Stay with my family.

01:32:36.864 --> 01:32:38.073
Are you sure?

01:32:38.657 --> 01:32:40.659
See you in London.

01:32:44.163 --> 01:32:45.498
We're ready.

01:32:46.123 --> 01:32:48.292
It's just us. The professor is staying.

01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:57.635
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:33:41.595 --> 01:33:44.264
- Perry?
- They're just leaving now.

01:33:46.976 --> 01:33:48.310
Didn't want me to go with him.

01:33:48.394 --> 01:33:49.561
And how was he?

01:33:49.645 --> 01:33:50.729
He seemed fine.

01:33:53.357 --> 01:33:55.484
I'd better speak to Ollie
so that I know where he...

01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:11.000
Hello?

01:34:14.753 --> 01:34:15.921
Perry?

01:34:24.972 --> 01:34:26.348
Perry, are you there?

01:34:58.922 --> 01:35:01.091
Oh, Dima!

01:35:50.474 --> 01:35:52.392
And today's financial news.

01:35:52.518 --> 01:35:56.271
The Arena Bank of Cyprus
started trading in London this morning.

01:35:56.522 --> 01:35:57.940
Among the guests at the launch

01:35:58.023 --> 01:36:01.818
was the new Minister of Trade
and Industry, Aubrey Longrigg,

01:36:01.902 --> 01:36:04.071
who welcomed the new bank
to the city community.

01:37:19.771 --> 01:37:22.899
- This a bad time?
- No. No, not at all. Come in.

01:37:24.776 --> 01:37:27.696
- Oh, you're expecting people.
- No, no, it's just me.

01:37:27.821 --> 01:37:29.406
I like to cook.

01:37:31.867 --> 01:37:36.204
Wilfred bloody Owen,
Siegfried bloody Sassoon,

01:37:36.329 --> 01:37:38.540
Robert bloody Graves ET Al.

01:37:38.623 --> 01:37:39.666
What about them?

01:37:39.875 --> 01:37:42.794
Your fabulous article in
the London Review of Books.

01:37:44.337 --> 01:37:48.050
"The sacrifice of brave men
cannot be justified by

01:37:48.133 --> 01:37:50.135
"the pursuit of an unjust war."

01:37:50.385 --> 01:37:51.970
It's bloody marvellous.

01:37:52.846 --> 01:37:54.473
- Single malt?
- Yes, thanks.

01:38:01.938 --> 01:38:03.106
Cheers.

01:38:04.441 --> 01:38:05.942
Ah. Here, come through.

01:38:06.234 --> 01:38:07.611
Thanks.

01:38:13.074 --> 01:38:14.743
Have the family all settled?

01:38:14.826 --> 01:38:16.745
Yes, yes, they're very grateful.

01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:18.330
Well, it was the least I could do.

01:38:18.663 --> 01:38:20.957
I wanted to pay them a visit, but, erm,

01:38:21.625 --> 01:38:23.502
I wasn't sure how they'd feel, so...

01:38:24.836 --> 01:38:26.213
Here, have a seat.

01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:29.216
- How's Gail?
- She's good.

01:38:29.966 --> 01:38:32.135
- And you?
- Better.

01:38:35.555 --> 01:38:37.390
Dima wanted you to have this.

01:38:38.475 --> 01:38:40.143
Tamara gave it to me.

01:38:47.234 --> 01:38:48.652
What did he want me to do, shoot myself?

01:38:51.029 --> 01:38:52.822
Was there a message with it?

01:38:53.949 --> 01:38:55.116
Not that I know of.

01:39:09.381 --> 01:39:11.341
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.888
His family are safe
and that's what he wanted.

01:39:19.808 --> 01:39:21.017
I'm gonna leave you to your cooking.

01:39:21.142 --> 01:39:22.561
You're more than welcome
to stay if you'd like.

01:39:22.686 --> 01:39:23.895
No, thanks.

01:39:24.187 --> 01:39:25.397
Okay.

01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:30.151
Smells good.
