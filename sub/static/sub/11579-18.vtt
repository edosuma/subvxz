00:01.468 --> 00:03.231
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.303 --> 00:07.000
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.073 --> 00:08.131
In New York City,

00:08.208 --> 00:11.177
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.244 --> 00:14.771
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.848 --> 00:16.816
These are their stories,

00:21.254 --> 00:23.620
Hey, Sammy.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.816
Long time no see.
It's good to see you.
GIad you called.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.856
Something happened.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.625
Yeah, what's that?

00:34.768 --> 00:36.258
Bad.

00:36.336 --> 00:37.769
Tell me.

00:39.072 --> 00:42.735
My mom...
I think she knows.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.139
What makes you
think that?

00:47.213 --> 00:49.181
She keeps asking me
questions.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.443
Did you say anything?

00:50.517 --> 00:51.882
No, but she's all
freaked out.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.851
Okay. It's all right.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.354
This is no big
deal now, okay?
You just gotta be cool.

00:58.425 --> 01:02.020
AII right? Just be patient,
just be cool, okay?

01:02.095 --> 01:05.325
Just act Iike an adult,
Iike we always talk about.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.327
Okay.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.462
I don't want to get you
in trouble, man,
you know that.

01:13.139 --> 01:14.572
SAM: Yeah.

01:15.608 --> 01:18.805
I want to protect you,
all right?
Yeah.

01:20.780 --> 01:24.045
Right? So if anybody
asks you, what are
you gonna tell them?

01:24.851 --> 01:26.785
What do you think
I should say?

01:26.853 --> 01:29.481
That's good.
Let him hang himself.

01:29.556 --> 01:33.890
We didn't do anything
wrong, Nothing illegal
happened, right?

01:34.861 --> 01:36.488
Uh-huh, Yeah,

01:36.563 --> 01:37.996
We're just good friends,

01:38.064 --> 01:39.998
He's gotta say
more than that.

01:40.066 --> 01:43.900
I told my mom
nothing happened,
She didn't believe me,

01:43.970 --> 01:46.438
That's all right,
It's just moms,

01:46.506 --> 01:47.564
They don't
always understand,

01:51.578 --> 01:53.944
Hey. You okay, buddy?

01:55.315 --> 01:57.943
You seem really
stressed out.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.080
Run.
What?

02:04.090 --> 02:05.182
No.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.886
SAM: They're listening, Run!
Pick him up. Pick him up.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.121
Get him outside.
Kid tipped him off.

02:09.195 --> 02:10.287
Don't Iet him
near the tracks.

02:10.363 --> 02:13.457
Barnett, can we have
a word with you, please?

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.650 --> 02:32.049
You haven't identified
yourself.

02:32.118 --> 02:33.881
But you already know
who we are, don't you, Roy?

02:33.953 --> 02:37.354
Don't worry. We're
gonna get real intimate
before you know it.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.684
What the hell
just happened?

02:41.761 --> 02:43.092
The kid warned him.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.056
It's okay.
You did good.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.067
But we got
something, right?

02:49.135 --> 02:52.036
After all that,
he had to say something
that we can nail him on.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.504
Not enough.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.691
BARNETT ON TAPE: We didn't
do anything wrong, Nothing
illegal happened, right?

03:48.761 --> 03:49.853
Nothing illegal.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.955
Unless we're talking about
Iaw enforcement using
a child to entrap my client.

03:53.032 --> 03:56.126
BENSON: Entrapment. How many
times do we hear that word
when we record conversations?

03:56.202 --> 03:57.191
Every time.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.602
Don't Iet your Iawyer
fool you, Mr. Barnett.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.401
No judge is going to
throw that tape out.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.601
Every word you said
is evidence against you.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.474
Against him? AII he said was
he didn't do anything wrong.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.275
You tried to coerce
your victim to Iie.

04:08.348 --> 04:11.715
You... Wow,
you must have super powers.
I didn't hear any of that.

04:11.784 --> 04:12.876
STABLER:
You know what I heard?

04:12.952 --> 04:15.921
For four years, you've been
taking Sam Cavanaugh
to your apartment

04:15.989 --> 04:17.923
and forcing him
to perform sex acts.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.015
That isn't true.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.719
Hey, pal, according
to Sam it is.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.285
Look, Sam's a great kid,
but he's very troubled.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.355
He makes things up
to see what'II happen.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.128
Why does that sound
so familiar?

04:29.302 --> 04:31.133
Well, maybe it's because
you used the same excuse

04:31.204 --> 04:33.695
in your statement
about another boy in 1985,

04:34.440 --> 04:37.534
and again in 1990. Now, did
they make that up, too?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.578
STABLER: You just
make it a habit
of consorting with Iiars.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.045
Those were misunderstandings.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.675
But you pled guilty
to coercion and
endangering a child anyway.

04:44.751 --> 04:47.311
The world just doesn't
understand men Iike him,

04:47.387 --> 04:51.619
who have a deep,
abiding Iove for young boys.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.353
You don't have the problem.
We do, right?

04:55.428 --> 04:58.056
That's a fascinating glimpse
into your psyche, Detective.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.564
If you're going to charge
my client...

04:59.632 --> 05:01.623
Look, can I just
say one thing?

05:01.701 --> 05:04.431
I spend time with Sam
because I Iike him.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.064
I feel sorry for him because
he doesn't have a father.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.474
Sometimes boys
just need to talk to a man.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.003
If I'm guilty of anything,

05:13.079 --> 05:16.480
it's of having
an overdeveloped
sense of responsibility.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.847
I consider Sam a friend.

05:20.019 --> 05:23.648
I would never do
anything to hurt him.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.652
Nice performance.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.694
He's been through the system
enough to know exactly
how to sound innocent.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.524
Two more minutes and we
would've had everything.

05:30.596 --> 05:33.861
There's no guarantee
Barnett would have
incriminated himself on tape,

05:33.933 --> 05:35.298
even if Sam
hadn't told him.

05:35.368 --> 05:39.168
That kid worked with us
for over a month.
Why change his mind now?

05:39.238 --> 05:41.229
Because part of Sam
still cares for Barnett.

05:41.307 --> 05:43.775
But Sam reported Barnett
to the police.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.243
No, he didn't.
His mother did.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.740
That's an important
distinction.

05:47.814 --> 05:51.443
Sam told his mother about
the abuse, but not before
she confronted him.

05:51.517 --> 05:56.318
From Sam's manipulated
perspective, he's protecting
the one man who Ioves him.

05:56.456 --> 06:01.155
Barnett chooses boys who are
vulnerable, boys who crave
affection and support.

06:01.227 --> 06:05.755
They're the easiest victims
to control and the Ieast
Iikely to turn on him.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.367
Whatever Sam's reasons are,
the upshot is,
we've got no case.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.404
Well, we've still got
his testimony.
Debatable.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.702
He didn't seem
too compelled to testify
the Iast time I saw him...

06:14.774 --> 06:16.071
Then we've gotta
compel him.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.769
Doc, maybe you can see
where his head's at.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.711
No, I don't think
I'm the best choice.
Victims his age are afraid

06:20.780 --> 06:23.408
that because their abuser
is male, they themselves
might be gay.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.111
He might perceive my presence
as an accusation.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.312
I'II talk to him.
He thinks this is
all his fault.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.017
The hardest part is going
to be convincing him
that he's wrong.

06:32.291 --> 06:33.918
AII right, I'II take
the mother into my office.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.928
You talk to Sam
in the interview room.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.123
CABOT: What we asked
you to do was a
very difficult thing.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.759
I am sorry you had
to go through it.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.061
I want you to know right now,
nobody blames you
for telling him,

06:46.139 --> 06:47.470
all right?

06:48.274 --> 06:50.003
I don't believe you.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.270
Why?

06:51.444 --> 06:53.537
Because I wrecked the whole
thing. I know you're mad.

06:53.613 --> 06:57.208
Not at you. I understand
why you wouldn't want to
get Barnett in trouble.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.148
There's nothing wrong
with that.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.583
Wrong with what?

07:01.621 --> 07:05.751
Caring about
what happens to him,
even if you don't want to.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.796
Sam, what Roy Barnett did
to you was never your fault.

07:10.863 --> 07:14.560
He chose you because
you are young
and he could control you.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.693
When you decide
you want to be with someone,

07:16.769 --> 07:20.296
whoever that person is,
it will be your choice.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.468
I'm not a fag.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.071
I'm not saying...

07:25.144 --> 07:26.702
I have a girlfriend.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.339
Okay...

07:29.415 --> 07:31.042
I'm not a fag!

07:31.117 --> 07:34.382
I don't want to
talk about it anymore!

07:37.690 --> 07:39.783
Sweetheart. Sweetheart,
wait. What is it?

07:39.859 --> 07:40.985
I want to go home.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.518
Oh, Sam, come on.
We can talk...
No, I don't want to do this!

07:44.597 --> 07:46.155
Mrs. Cavanaugh, I'm sorry...

07:46.232 --> 07:48.029
You said it would be over.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.068
You said nothing
would go wrong.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.160
Nothing went wrong.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.602
We've still got him
in custody.

07:52.672 --> 07:57.541
The only reason I came to you
was because I didn't
know what else to do.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.074
He didn't want to
call the police.
HUANG:
You did the right thing.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.478
With Sam's help, we could put
Barnett away for a Iong time.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.574
We tried to help you.
It didn't work.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.016
You've already
come this far.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.110
No.

08:09.789 --> 08:13.418
I'm not going to put him
through this again.
We're done.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.294
Where's Barnett now?
BENSON: He's processing.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.059
He'II be out on bail
by tomorrow afternoon.

08:20.132 --> 08:24.330
Which means we've got until
then to build a case against
him without Sam Cavanaugh.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.200
Any chance on finding
other victims?

08:26.272 --> 08:29.799
Barnett's parole included
mandatory therapy
which he allegedly attended.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.241
I wonder what
dirty Iittle secrets
he shared with that shrink.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.903
CRAGEN: Track down
the therapist. What else?

08:33.980 --> 08:35.845
We've gotta get into
his apartment.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.246
Guys Iike these,
they're collectors.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.251
So photos, videos, something
to prove Sam's story.

08:40.318 --> 08:42.582
AIex, I assume we've got
cause for a warrant?

08:42.655 --> 08:45.852
PIenty. You'II have it
by the time you get there.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.285
STABLER: So much
for being a collector.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.058
This guy doesn't keep
anything about his victims.

08:52.131 --> 08:55.157
Well, he collects
every single porno
ever made, though.

08:55.234 --> 08:56.929
AII hetero, all adult.

08:57.003 --> 09:00.131
Latest video games
with every component
state of the art.

09:00.206 --> 09:04.575
Look at this. Sports stuff,
video games, wide screen TV,
plenty of porn.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.373
Are we sensing a theme?

09:06.445 --> 09:08.072
Yeah, it's a teenage boy's
paradise.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.978
Everything you need
to seduce your next victim.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.641
Boys probably Iike
spending time here

09:11.717 --> 09:13.912
'cause it's a Iot more fun
than their own house.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.181
But everywhere you turn,
more sex.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.381
Get their motor running,

09:17.456 --> 09:18.946
and then just take it
a Iittle bit further
every time.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.515
Only one big problem we got.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.686
None of this stuff
is incriminating.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.320
MAN: Nothing of note
in the bedroom.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.128
We'II take the hard drive
down to the Iab. Maybe
they'II have better Iuck.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.296
120 gigabyte hard drive.
119 gigabytes of porn.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.861
So you were
able to access it?

09:33.940 --> 09:35.601
Yeah. But none of it's kids.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.643
You want to see
the Britney Spears collection?

09:37.710 --> 09:39.234
Maybe Iater.
What else did you find?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.506
Well, it's what
we didn't find.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.845
Usually the Internet files
are a gold mine,
but not with this guy.

09:43.916 --> 09:47.818
He emptied out his cache,
his histories, his Internet
temporary directories.

09:47.887 --> 09:50.151
Okay. Service provider?
Doesn't save its records.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.486
Well, how the hell
did he have time
to get rid of all that?

09:52.558 --> 09:54.492
He didn't know
we were Iooking at him
until his arrest.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.154
My guess is he clears out
these files daily.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.163
But I thought you guys
could retrieve deleted files.

09:59.231 --> 10:02.359
He's got one of those
hard-core scrubber software
on his drive.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.131
It's not Department
of Defense grade,
but it's pretty thorough.

10:05.204 --> 10:08.401
It writes over
deleted files between
eight and twenty times.

10:08.474 --> 10:11.170
I've been able to extract
a word, and fragments
of an image here and there.

10:11.243 --> 10:12.733
So where does that
Ieave us?

10:12.812 --> 10:15.337
Well, give me six months,
$50,000, and an
electron microscope,

10:15.414 --> 10:18.713
I might be able to find
something. But I might not.

10:20.419 --> 10:23.286
Pulled Barnett's file
after I got off
the phone with you.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.450
Parole board thought
he was the poster boy
for the therapy program.

10:26.525 --> 10:27.958
Sounds Iike
you didn't believe that.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.153
Not for a second.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.459
Barnett was one of the most
gifted Iiars I've met,
but he was still a Iiar.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.294
So is every criminal.
So is my partner,
for that matter.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.800
What makes Barnett so special?

10:35.868 --> 10:38.302
Fooled everybody around him
into thinking he was cured.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.430
FIN: Why not you?
Instinct.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.599
Quantify instinct.
I don't.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.199
That's good.
Very scientific.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.074
I saw it most during
group therapy.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.479
Barnett just Ioved
Iistening to his fellow
sex offenders disclose.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.109
Getting his rocks off
while he's supposed to be
getting rehabilitated.

10:53.185 --> 10:54.618
He wasn't the only one.

10:54.687 --> 10:58.054
Guys Iike him are a big reason
I Ieft the prison system
for teaching.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.989
What about Barnett?
Did he disclose?

11:00.059 --> 11:02.254
Part of his behavioral
intervention.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.525
At one point, he admitted
to molesting over 100 boys.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.864
Did he happen to mention
names, dates or places?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.333
Too smart for that.

11:13.472 --> 11:16.930
He's far more calculating
than your typical pedophile.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.409
Barnett never chooses
victims of opportunity,

11:19.478 --> 11:22.174
Iike children of a girlfriend
or a second wife.

11:22.248 --> 11:26.344
He's a true predator.
Unrepentant, unstoppable.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.081
No amount of therapy
will change that.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.992
You're telling me
we've got nothing.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.463
CABOT: We have a victim.
Who won't testify.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.794
We've got nothing.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.800
Yet. The detectives
can still investigate.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.462
Well, exactly how much
more time and resources

11:45.538 --> 11:47.233
would you Iike to waste
on this guy?

11:47.306 --> 11:49.001
It's not a waste
if we nail him.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.009
Barnett's smart.
He's not going
to make it easy on us.

11:51.077 --> 11:55.411
I had your job for 10 years.
None of these guys
are Rhodes Scholars.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.506
And in my job,
you pled Barnett down.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.211
Charged with sodomy two,
you Iet him off on coercion.

12:00.286 --> 12:03.312
It was a first offense,
and there was no evidence.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.186
But please,
Iet's compare records

12:05.257 --> 12:07.691
on how many child molesters
we've pled out over the years.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.490
AII I'm saying is,
these cases are never
slam dunks, Liz.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.225
Assuming you can
even find the victims,
they rarely want to testify.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.530
I don't need you
to tell me how the
Special Victims Bureau works.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.934
I haven't been gone
that Iong.

12:19.004 --> 12:22.940
The fact is, you had a
slam dunk with Sam Cavanaugh,
and you blew it.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.635
I can't force him to testify.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.109
You can try.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.169
Barnett is Iet Ioose again,
it Iooks bad for everybody,

12:28.247 --> 12:31.216
and the prosecutors
get the brunt of the blame.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.616
I remember that from my time
in Special Victims as well.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.882
Don't tell me
that's changed.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.123
I don't understand
why you can't just go
to the grand jury

12:44.196 --> 12:47.188
and tell them what Sam
told you. They'II believe you.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.496
They need to hear it
from Sam himself.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.036
What if I told them
what he told me?

12:52.438 --> 12:55.430
That's hearsay,
and the Iaw doesn't allow it.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.566
You weren't in Barnett's
apartment with Sam.

12:59.812 --> 13:03.441
I wish I was.
Just one time.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.509
I could have stopped it.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.086
I would have killed him.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.250
The only person whose fault
this is is Roy Barnett's.

13:13.325 --> 13:16.089
I want to make him pay
for what he did to your son.

13:16.162 --> 13:20.394
But if I can't put him
on trial, he is going to keep
doing this to other boys.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.990
I'm sorry, Ms. Cabot, I...

13:22.067 --> 13:23.967
I know how much
you Iove your son.

13:24.036 --> 13:28.063
Don't Iet the man
who did this walk away
without being punished.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.744
(SIGHS)

13:53.065 --> 13:57.559
I know you
don't want to do this.
I don't want you to either.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.739
And I know
this is my fault.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.140
A Iot of it.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.813
And I will never forgive
myself for Ietting
that man come near you.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.585
Mom, please.

14:25.564 --> 14:29.591
So you tell me
what you want to do.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.235
We won't talk
about it again.

14:33.305 --> 14:37.207
You want me to tell
this Iady to go, I will.

14:38.444 --> 14:43.541
You tell me
what you want to do
and that's what we'II do.

14:52.157 --> 14:55.957
I'II do it.
I'II do the trial.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.366
Okay.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.006
STABLER:
It's okay if you're nervous.

15:21.787 --> 15:25.245
This is the worst part.
Waiting.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.852
The first time
that I testified
in front of all those people,

15:29.929 --> 15:34.298
I was so nervous I forgot
the name of the guy
I was testifying against.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.330
How many people again?

15:39.405 --> 15:42.067
You got 16 jurors,
plus Ms. Cabot.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.568
She said Roy
was going to be there.

15:45.644 --> 15:49.136
Not while you're testifying.
You never have to see him.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.283
I don't care.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.818
So now when you testify
and stuff, it's easy?

16:01.894 --> 16:03.327
Not always.

16:05.130 --> 16:10.067
But when you get older,
when you're a man, you gotta
do things that are difficult.

16:10.903 --> 16:14.361
Nobody in there believes
this is gonna be easy for you.

16:16.608 --> 16:20.169
It takes a Iot of guts.
A Iot of courage.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.441
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

16:26.518 --> 16:28.452
Okay. We're ready.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.790
CABOT: When was
the first time
you remember Mr. Barnett

16:35.861 --> 16:39.319
touching you in a way
that made you
feel uncomfortable?

16:39.932 --> 16:41.593
SAM: When I was 12.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.866
Do you remember
what happened?

16:48.307 --> 16:52.266
I was at Roy's.
I mean, Mr. Barnett's.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.606
We were just hanging out.

16:57.750 --> 17:02.084
He gave me some beer
because I helped him
change the oil in his car.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.387
How much did you drink?

17:05.190 --> 17:08.489
I don't... I don't remember.
He just kept getting me some.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.720
Okay.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.922
What happened next?

17:16.902 --> 17:19.734
He started
showing me stuff.

17:20.506 --> 17:24.101
Magazines.
Pictures of girls.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.144
Then what happened?

17:28.012 --> 17:30.345
He talked about how
guys Iiked to Iook at them

17:30.416 --> 17:33.442
'cause it made them
feel good,

17:33.986 --> 17:36.511
and that nothing
was bad about that.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.982
What else did he say?

17:43.929 --> 17:47.456
He said that
everybody does it.
That it's no big deal.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.762
When he touched you,
what did he say?

18:05.050 --> 18:08.611
Roy said he could
show me how to do it.

18:11.890 --> 18:15.951
He said that
he knew how to do it right
'cause he was older.

18:17.262 --> 18:22.427
He said that all guys did it,
and that I could be
a man just Iike him.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.901
After Iunch I will present
the rest of the testimony
to the grand jury,

18:30.976 --> 18:32.204
and they will deliberate.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.644
I don't think
it'II take very Iong
to get an indictment.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.443
How'd it go?
Sam did great.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.484
MRS. CAVANAUGH: Can we go now?
I'II call you
as soon as we know.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.041
You did good.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.377
Damn it.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.858
Keep walking, dirt bag.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.758
Burn in hell,
you sick son of a bitch!

18:53.832 --> 18:57.165
The bastard ruined my Iife!
Bastard ruined my Iife!

18:57.236 --> 19:01.502
You ruined my Iife,
you sick bastard!
I hope you rot in hell!

19:02.441 --> 19:04.272
You ruined my Iife!
Sam. Sam...

19:04.343 --> 19:06.038
Hold the elevator.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.640
You okay?
Yeah.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.480
I thought I was over it.

19:16.555 --> 19:20.514
But then I saw him
on the news,
when you arrested him.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.687
I saw his face,
and it all came back.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.759
I don't even know
what I was trying to do.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.597
When did it happen?

19:34.439 --> 19:39.035
It started when I was 1 1.
He coached baseball
after school.

19:40.712 --> 19:45.274
Picked out the "special" kids
for extra practice.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.712
BENSON: How many were there?
A few.

19:49.254 --> 19:52.223
Most of them moved away
or stopped going.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.192
But I kept coming back
for five years.

19:55.627 --> 19:58.221
That's why
I never told anybody.

19:58.564 --> 20:02.295
Because eventually
you have to admit,
it's your choice, you know?

20:02.367 --> 20:03.391
I could have stopped it...

20:03.468 --> 20:05.629
Tommy, we don't care
if you went back
for 10 years.

20:05.704 --> 20:09.265
The second
that he touched you,
he took away your choice.

20:09.908 --> 20:14.345
When I got older, he told me
to not come over anymore.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.838
I thought I had done
something wrong.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.976
He just kept telling me
to bring my friends over.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.850
My younger friends.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.647
Whose fault is that?

20:25.724 --> 20:26.918
Barnett's.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.424
He was the adult,
and you were the child.

20:30.495 --> 20:33.521
We're having trouble Iocating
Barnett's other victims.

20:33.599 --> 20:36.363
You remember
any of these boys' names?

20:37.336 --> 20:38.769
It was a Iong time ago.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.304
We really need to
talk to them.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.567
The more people
who come forward,
the Ionger he'II be in prison.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.041
And I want to press charges
against Barnett.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.840
I'm tired of hiding
from this.

20:49.781 --> 20:52.341
How old are you now?
27.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.082
Tommy,

20:58.156 --> 21:02.024
unfortunately
the statute of Iimitations
has already expired.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.928
The Iaw says that these
crimes have to be reported

21:04.997 --> 21:07.659
within five years
of your turning 18.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.831
So that's it, then?

21:12.771 --> 21:16.605
I waited too Iong,
and he just gets away with it?

21:21.213 --> 21:25.047
My client's elected
not to file assault charges
against his attacker.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.086
How extremely generous of him,
considering he doesn't
have a scratch on him.

21:28.153 --> 21:30.212
Mr. Barnett would
Iike to discuss a deal.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.189
This is getting out of hand.
He'd Iike to put it
behind him.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.384
I Iive to make things
easier for your client.

21:34.459 --> 21:38.054
Well, we're willing
to consider
custodial interference two.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.188
Consider it?

21:39.264 --> 21:42.131
You will consider
a misdemeanor instead of
three felony indictments?

21:42.200 --> 21:44.930
You want to put that boy
through the pain of a trial?

21:45.003 --> 21:46.300
This is incredible.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.396
Either you're
a complete idiot
or you think I am.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.499
AIex, there's gotta be room
for some maneuvering here.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.771
Not this time.
It stops here.

21:53.845 --> 21:56.712
Barnett wants to
put this behind him,
you tell him to plead guilty.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.376
It'II save everybody
a Iot of time.

21:59.951 --> 22:03.887
You know you've got them when
the defense starts professing
concern about the victim.

22:03.955 --> 22:07.413
He is as bad as his client,
hoping the victim
is too traumatized to testify.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.825
He's Iucky I didn't knock
his teeth down his throat.

22:11.196 --> 22:13.664
I'd pay real money
to see that.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.960
Tommy Priore gave us
a Iist of other boys

22:16.034 --> 22:18.628
who were possible victims
of Barnett 15 years ago.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.502
Mostly partial, nicknames,
but we'II track them down.

22:21.573 --> 22:23.370
It'II help us establish
a pattern of behavior,

22:23.442 --> 22:25.137
but the statute's probably
expired on all of them.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.871
We're hoping that they'II
Iead us to other boys.

22:26.945 --> 22:28.913
Barnett used to Iike
to find his victims
through referral

22:28.980 --> 22:30.504
from whoever
he was molesting at the time.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.743
Sam Cavanaugh
ever refer anybody?

22:32.818 --> 22:35.912
Never said. But then again,
he hasn't been
the most forthcoming kid.

22:35.987 --> 22:39.980
I'm meeting him in an hour
to go over trial procedure.
I'II ask.

22:40.425 --> 22:42.586
Now, the defense attorney's
going to try to confuse you

22:42.661 --> 22:45.095
and make it seem Iike
you misunderstood
what happened.

22:45.163 --> 22:48.291
Just answer as honestly
and briefly as possible.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.028
You know what I mean?

22:50.102 --> 22:51.763
Yeah, just give
yes or no answers.

22:51.837 --> 22:54.670
Very good. Look directly
at him when he's asking
the questions,

22:54.740 --> 22:56.935
and Iook at me
when I'm asking them.

22:57.008 --> 23:00.603
Mr. Barnett will be there,
but he can't
say anything to you.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.809
How Iong do you think
it'II take?

23:03.882 --> 23:05.816
I'II try to make it go
as fast as possible.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.374
But as for
the defense attorney...

23:07.452 --> 23:09.579
Yeah, just yes or no answers.

23:09.654 --> 23:11.178
You'II do fine.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.594
I was thinking about
the other boys Roy knows

23:19.664 --> 23:22.326
who maybe aren't
as brave as you are.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.403
If we knew who they were,
we could help them.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.471
Sam, do you know
if there were any others?

23:31.943 --> 23:33.433
I think so.

23:35.046 --> 23:38.982
I didn't know them,
but Roy kept telling me
how I was getting older,

23:39.050 --> 23:42.178
and that pretty soon
I wouldn't need to be
his friend anymore.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.984
I don't really think
he was your friend.

23:47.492 --> 23:52.361
I remember this one time,
Roy picked me up
early from school.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.996
He always says people need
a break once in a while.

23:57.402 --> 23:58.528
We went over to the piers,

23:58.603 --> 24:02.699
and he took me on
one of those tour boats
that go all around the city.

24:02.941 --> 24:07.037
It was really freezing,
and I didn't have my coat,

24:07.779 --> 24:09.508
so he gave me his.

24:11.683 --> 24:14.618
And then when it got dark,
all the Iights
in the city came on.

24:14.686 --> 24:17.917
I'd never seen it Iike that.
It was really cool.

24:19.758 --> 24:24.627
Then when we got back
he bought me a burger
and took me home.

24:26.898 --> 24:30.800
He wasn't all weird and stuff.
He didn't try anything.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.398
I think that was one of
the best times I ever had.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.144
How sick is that?

24:46.017 --> 24:49.714
It's not sick. That's what
he wanted you to think.

24:50.121 --> 24:54.683
He wanted to make you
Iike him because he knew
what he was doing was wrong.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.789
So he never really Iiked me?

25:01.800 --> 25:04.530
Yeah, I guess
that's what I thought.

25:08.139 --> 25:09.538
You want a ride home?

25:09.608 --> 25:11.166
My mom gave me
money for a cab.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.437
It's Iate. I'II take you.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.479
No, that's all right.

25:14.546 --> 25:16.207
It's almost over.

25:17.549 --> 25:18.880
I know.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.491
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

25:34.132 --> 25:35.622
Hello?

25:37.235 --> 25:38.634
Oh, my God.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.106
He's still alive.
They're working on him now.

25:46.177 --> 25:47.906
His mom found him.
He asphyxiated.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.345
They don't know how Iong
he stopped breathing.

25:50.415 --> 25:53.248
How?
Aspirin
and his anti-depressants.

25:54.319 --> 25:57.254
Get out of here.
Get her out of here!

25:57.889 --> 26:00.449
Get out! Are you happy now?

26:00.692 --> 26:03.422
Is there anything else
you want him to do for you?

26:03.495 --> 26:06.692
Get out! Get out of here!

26:07.866 --> 26:10.096
Let go of me. I'm fine.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.103
Oh, God.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.875
Here's what the attending
told me.

26:20.946 --> 26:24.438
Sam suffered from hypoxia
due to Iack of oxygen,

26:24.516 --> 26:26.882
which Ied to cardiac arrest.
God.

26:26.952 --> 26:30.911
He's on a respirator now.
The neurologist said
there is some brain activity.

26:30.989 --> 26:33.253
Some? What does that mean?
Is he going to wake up?

26:33.325 --> 26:37.318
Possibly. But there's
no telling how much
brain damage was done.

26:37.395 --> 26:39.124
BENSON: Could it have been
an accidental OD?

26:39.197 --> 26:40.391
Didn't find a note.

26:40.465 --> 26:42.490
MUNCH: They don't
always Ieave one.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.933
Look, AIex,
this kid had problems
Iong before you...

26:45.003 --> 26:47.096
I want to know if Barnett
had any contact with him.

26:47.172 --> 26:48.764
Dump the phones.
We already did it.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.070
Barnett didn't call Sam.
Other way around.

26:51.142 --> 26:54.669
15-second call from
Sam's house to Barnett's
near midnight.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.873
Are you trying for coercing
a witness?

26:56.948 --> 26:58.779
15 seconds doesn't
seem Iong enough.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.579
PIus Sam initiated
the contact.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.279
It's Iong enough.
I don't care
who made the call.

27:02.354 --> 27:06.347
Barnett had a strong influence
over him. It is possible
that he gave him the idea.

27:06.424 --> 27:08.790
I don't want possible,
I want to crucify this guy.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.919
Where are we
on unreported victims?

27:10.996 --> 27:12.930
We ran the names
Tommy Priore gave us

27:12.998 --> 27:16.900
through DMV, public records,
tax rolls, utilities.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.436
We came up with one hit,
Benjamin Tucker.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.529
But you're not gonna Iike him.
Why?

27:21.606 --> 27:23.733
He's in Sing Sing,
convicted two years ago,

27:23.808 --> 27:25.241
and his preference
is eight-year-old girls.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.369
Another pedophile. Perfect.

27:27.445 --> 27:28.969
Set it up.
I'II meet you there.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.572
Where you going?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.481
To try and save this case.

27:33.551 --> 27:36.577
Barnett's attorney
filed a motion to dismiss.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.390
Is this true?

27:42.460 --> 27:43.484
Every word.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.392
The complaining witness
is no Ionger available,

27:45.463 --> 27:48.227
and the prosecution cannot
meet its burden of proof.

27:48.299 --> 27:52.030
He's been incapacitated
for 12 hours, Your Honor.
He's not dead.

27:52.103 --> 27:53.730
The motion to dismiss
is premature.

27:53.805 --> 27:57.172
Devastated by hypoxia.
This Ieaves Iittle room
for interpretation.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.300
So you're a doctor now?

27:58.376 --> 27:59.400
Hold on.

27:59.477 --> 28:02.275
Is the boy going to
recover or not?

28:02.347 --> 28:03.837
There's no way
to answer that.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.246
She's not a doctor either.

28:05.316 --> 28:09.685
Mr. Kressler, it's not
particularly attractive to be
so happy about this tragedy,

28:09.754 --> 28:12.416
so Iet's kill
the enthusiasm. However...

28:12.490 --> 28:14.583
Your Honor, the People have
a right to try this case.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.820
And the defendant has
the right to a speedy trial.

28:16.895 --> 28:19.125
You've got three days. Next?

28:19.397 --> 28:21.262
Sam Cavanaugh testified
in front of a grand jury

28:21.332 --> 28:22.594
before he was
made unavailable.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.430
I would Iike his testimony
to be read at trial.

28:24.502 --> 28:25.628
He was never cross-examined.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.002
My client has a right
to confront his accuser.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.474
People v, Geraci,
When a witness has been
intimidated by the defendant,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.408
the use of the witness's
grand jury testimony

28:33.478 --> 28:35.810
as a part of the People's
direct case is warranted.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.678
Your client had contact
with Sam Cavanaugh
the night he overdosed.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.274
Don't tell me
that is a coincidence.

28:40.351 --> 28:43.752
It was a 15-second phone call,
originated by the witness.

28:43.822 --> 28:46.655
Mr. Barnett told him
they couldn't speak,
and he hung up on the kid.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.285
I would hardly
call this intimidation.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.988
Four years of physical
and mental abuse.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.999
Four years of manipulating
that boy into doing whatever
that man told him to do.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.400
I would argue their entire
relationship Ied to the
witness's attempted suicide.

28:59.471 --> 29:02.201
You want to prove he tried
to kill himself
because he was abused

29:02.273 --> 29:05.538
so you can prove
he was abused. I...
What kind of Iogic is this?

29:05.610 --> 29:08.101
Circular Iogic,
and it's bootstrapping.

29:08.179 --> 29:11.615
Nice try, Ms. Cabot,
but the grand jury
testimony is out.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.480
PIease, Your Honor...
Three days.

29:13.551 --> 29:17.419
If the People can't make
their case by then,
I'II have to throw it out.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.664
I started offending
when I was 18.

29:28.399 --> 29:33.632
I had a Iot of anger, and also
I had a Iot of self-hatred.

29:34.672 --> 29:37.539
You know, because of
what Roy did to me.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.875
And because my parents
were...distant.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.471
That right?

29:47.318 --> 29:48.945
I read about that kid
who overdosed.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.682
You want, I could testify
against Roy for molesting me.

29:51.756 --> 29:54.122
Your history
of Iying to obtain
more Ienient sentencing

29:54.192 --> 29:56.319
makes that a Iess
than compelling offer.

29:56.394 --> 29:58.294
I was a victim.
Yes, you were.

29:58.363 --> 30:01.696
And you can help us
prosecute your molester
by giving us information.

30:01.766 --> 30:05.065
You kept some kind of records
when you were offending,
right?

30:05.136 --> 30:07.900
Little pictures,
mementos from your victims,

30:07.972 --> 30:10.805
so you could...relive
the excitement of it all?

30:12.177 --> 30:14.441
Yeah.
Where did Roy keep his?

30:17.382 --> 30:19.680
I don't remember.
Well, think a Iittle harder.

30:19.751 --> 30:22.083
Seriously. No idea.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.951
What do you want?
Well...

30:26.457 --> 30:29.255
What can you give me?
We're done.

30:30.261 --> 30:33.196
I want a transfer
to a psych facility
for sex offenders.

30:33.264 --> 30:34.492
I don't belong in prison.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.659
Oh, but Roy Barnett does.

30:37.302 --> 30:41.830
I did some very terrible
things, but I know
they were wrong now.

30:41.906 --> 30:45.239
When I'm released, I know
I'm not going to put myself
in those situations again.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.369
I'm just going to stay away
from temptation.

30:47.445 --> 30:50.710
No driving by schools,
no going to malls.
None of that.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.841
If your information
Ieads to Barnett's conviction,

30:52.917 --> 30:55.249
I will consider your request.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.651
Only offer. Yes or no.
Right now.

31:04.395 --> 31:09.128
Roy knew
never to keep records,
but he had one weakness.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.363
Videotapes.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.264
Of what?
Him.

31:15.473 --> 31:18.670
With his victims.
He used to send them to us.

31:19.110 --> 31:20.907
STABLER: You got these tapes?

31:20.979 --> 31:22.537
That was his thing, not mine.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.946
That's not good enough.
We need tangible evidence.

31:25.016 --> 31:28.144
So you've got
this overdose kid.

31:28.253 --> 31:32.019
I guarantee Roy
sent him tapes, too.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.024
He couldn't help it.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.696
Mrs. Cavanaugh,
we're very sorry to intrude.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.038
May we speak with you
for a moment?

31:49.107 --> 31:50.472
What are you doing here?

31:50.541 --> 31:53.533
We have some new information
about Mr. Barnett
and your son,

31:53.611 --> 31:56.273
and it's extremely important
that you allow us
to search your home.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.645
No. Leave.

31:59.017 --> 32:01.508
Mrs. Cavanaugh, we can't begin
to understand your Ioss,

32:01.586 --> 32:04.350
but we can arrest
the man who molested Sam.

32:04.422 --> 32:07.016
You could have taken out
your gun and shot my son
in the head.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.424
It would have been the same
thing. Maybe better.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.932
I don't ever want to
see you people again.

32:22.540 --> 32:23.905
It's okay.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.206
Did you tell her
what we were Iooking for?

32:26.277 --> 32:28.575
Well, before or after she
started yelling for security?

32:28.646 --> 32:29.772
Does it matter?

32:29.847 --> 32:31.508
Write her a note
and slip it under the door.

32:31.582 --> 32:33.243
Leave a message
on the answering machine.

32:33.318 --> 32:35.912
Do you really think
she cares about helping us
make our case?

32:35.987 --> 32:37.750
Make her care.

32:37.922 --> 32:40.618
Well, we've still got this
other victim, Ben Tucker.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.557
Never in a million years.
STABLER: Why?

32:42.627 --> 32:44.527
You were sitting
right across the table
from him, EIIiot.

32:44.595 --> 32:47.257
Just based on that,
do you think
he is a good witness?

32:47.332 --> 32:48.959
Make him a good witness.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.591
I can't make his priors
disappear.

32:50.668 --> 32:52.863
Besides, that case would never
get past a grand jury.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.598
AII of a sudden you just
take cases you can win?

32:54.672 --> 32:57.573
I try the cases I am handed
by this squad.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.769
You don't Iike the evidence
I've got, find me some more.

32:59.844 --> 33:01.334
I can't do your job, too.

33:01.412 --> 33:03.175
You can't do my what?
Out of Iine, AIex.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.738
I am not out of Iine,
and I don't work for you.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.012
You work for me,
at my discretion.

33:08.086 --> 33:11.681
Your sole purpose in this
process is to bring me
a case I can prosecute,

33:11.756 --> 33:14.281
not one I have to fix.
Fine.

33:14.859 --> 33:18.295
Then you tell us, Counselor,
how can we help you
put this man away?

33:18.363 --> 33:20.593
What would you
Iike us to do?

33:29.807 --> 33:31.240
Nothing.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.468
You've done all you can.

33:48.092 --> 33:49.992
PETROVSKY: Are the People
ready to proceed?

33:50.061 --> 33:52.154
Request a continuance,
Your Honor.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.494
We've been here before,
Ms. Cabot.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.929
The People need more time
to gather additional evidence.

33:58.002 --> 34:00.766
Well, unfortunately,
the People's time has expired.

34:00.838 --> 34:02.863
As the defendant has the right
to a speedy trial,

34:02.940 --> 34:05.636
and pursuant to
CPL Section 30.30,

34:05.710 --> 34:08.201
I have no choice
but to dismiss this case.

34:08.279 --> 34:10.509
Mr. Barnett,
you're free to go.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.387
Stalking me, Counselor?

34:24.829 --> 34:26.956
I need a search warrant.
What are we searching for?

34:27.031 --> 34:29.864
Videotapes of Roy Barnett
engaged in sex acts
with minors.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.663
You're kidding.
Where are they?

34:31.735 --> 34:33.260
Sam Cavanaugh's house.
Oh.

34:33.337 --> 34:36.568
And his mother
would rather see you dead
than Iet you search the place.

34:36.641 --> 34:40.168
Information from
a reliable source?
Don't start.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.542
He was a victim of Barnett's
until five years ago.

34:42.612 --> 34:46.071
Which is old news.
What's the rest of the story?

34:46.417 --> 34:48.885
He's in Sing Sing for
aggravated sexual abuse one,

34:48.953 --> 34:51.444
plus a separate
fraud conviction.

34:51.522 --> 34:53.820
I can't believe
you're even asking.

34:53.891 --> 34:56.826
Roy Barnett is
a serial child molester.
He will not stop.

34:56.893 --> 34:59.124
Neither of which is a reason
to grant a warrant.

34:59.197 --> 35:00.459
The tapes are.

35:00.531 --> 35:03.432
You have no idea
whether they even exist.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.799
This is our Iast chance.
I have to risk it.

35:05.870 --> 35:10.500
I won't order a search based
on the dubious word
of a convicted pedophile.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.606
You Iook Iike hell, AIexandra.
Get some sleep.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.522
Hey, where were you?
We gotta go.
Coffee. What's up?

35:28.593 --> 35:31.528
Cabot called.
She wants us to meet her
at the Cavanaughs' now.

35:31.596 --> 35:33.063
We got a search warrant?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.292
She must've called in
a big favor.

35:38.503 --> 35:39.970
Mrs. Cavanaugh,
I'm here to inform you

35:40.037 --> 35:41.732
these premises are considered
a crime scene

35:41.806 --> 35:43.603
and subject to search
by the police.

35:43.674 --> 35:44.936
What crime?

35:45.009 --> 35:46.874
Your son's alleged
suicide attempt.

35:46.944 --> 35:48.104
Until we can prove otherwise,

35:48.179 --> 35:50.511
we are required to treat it
as an attempted homicide.

35:50.581 --> 35:53.709
Right. Maybe someone stuffed
the pills down his throat.

35:53.784 --> 35:56.548
Maybe I did it.
Is that what you're saying?
Mrs. Cavanaugh, I...

35:56.621 --> 35:59.749
I'd Iet you talk to him
yourself, but he can't speak.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.519
He's in a rehabilitation
hospital.

36:01.592 --> 36:03.992
Know when he's coming home?
I am not here to upset you.

36:04.061 --> 36:05.494
Never.

36:06.731 --> 36:07.993
The only reason I am here

36:08.065 --> 36:11.364
is to find evidence against
the man who hurt your son.

36:11.435 --> 36:14.131
I am more than willing
to accept blame
for what happened to Sam,

36:14.205 --> 36:18.005
but do not Iet Roy Barnett
get away with what he did.

36:28.286 --> 36:30.311
Any restrictions
on the search warrant?

36:30.388 --> 36:32.652
Nope. Whatever you can find.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.812
Liv.

36:58.182 --> 36:59.479
BENSON: What have you got?

36:59.550 --> 37:00.778
I don't know.

37:02.486 --> 37:04.954
Return address is Barnett's.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.649
Never bothered to open it.

37:20.304 --> 37:22.568
Oh, he's Ieaving town.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.108
You know, we're really
going to miss you.
Now what?

37:25.176 --> 37:26.666
We're helping you pack.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.871
You think all that stuff's
gonna fit in his cell?

37:28.946 --> 37:30.413
Probably not.

37:32.883 --> 37:35.374
Barnett's being processed.
We're heading to Mulligan's
to celebrate.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.284
Probably not gonna
want to do that.

37:37.355 --> 37:38.652
And why's that?

37:38.723 --> 37:40.020
Dad's mad.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.588
Get your asses in my office.

37:45.062 --> 37:48.930
You searched the Cavanaugh
place without consent?

37:49.700 --> 37:50.792
What?

37:50.868 --> 37:53.632
Barnett's attorney's
on the horn with every city
official he can think of,

37:53.704 --> 37:55.262
screaming
Fourth Amendment violation.

37:55.339 --> 37:57.466
We didn't need consent.
Cabot had the search warrant.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.168
Try again.

38:02.580 --> 38:06.641
Are you saying Cabot told you
she had a warrant?

38:07.084 --> 38:08.142
I don't remember.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.584
Don't give me that crap.

38:09.654 --> 38:13.021
You better start saving
your own jobs and stop
covering for the A.D.A.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.422
She didn't actually say
that she had a warrant.

38:15.493 --> 38:18.929
But she specifically told you
to meet her for a search,

38:18.996 --> 38:21.021
implying she had a warrant.

38:21.399 --> 38:22.730
She's out of her mind.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.963
Captain, it was a good faith
search. As far as we knew,
there was a warrant.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.528
EIIiot, good faith doesn't
cover Cabot Iying to you.

38:28.606 --> 38:30.335
BENSON:
She did that to protect us.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.137
What are you now, her Iawyer?

38:32.209 --> 38:35.804
Those tapes showed Barnett
with half a dozen other boys.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.904
If we hadn't found them,

38:36.981 --> 38:38.949
we would have never known
about his other victims.

38:39.016 --> 38:42.474
And if a judge
throws those tapes out,
we know nothing.

38:44.255 --> 38:47.520
Linda Cavanaugh
never consented
to any search.

38:47.591 --> 38:50.583
The Assistant District
Attorney Iied her way in

38:50.661 --> 38:53.255
by claiming the apartment
was a crime scene.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.960
Sam Cavanaugh's
alleged suicide attempt
was never investigated.

38:57.034 --> 38:59.867
Ms. Cabot, you're not
going to sell that here.
Don't even try it.

38:59.937 --> 39:04.306
This was a blatant
Fourth Amendment violation,
sanctioned

39:04.375 --> 39:07.139
and indeed carried out
by the People.

39:07.211 --> 39:09.702
Therefore, any evidence found
must be suppressed.

39:09.780 --> 39:12.510
Mr. Barnett's Fourth Amendment
rights were not violated.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.983
Linda Cavanaugh's
certainly were,
but she isn't the defendant.

39:15.052 --> 39:16.383
Mr. Barnett is.

39:16.454 --> 39:19.617
He has no standing
to contest a search
of someone else's home.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.521
Are you actually arguing

39:21.592 --> 39:25.323
that you can march in Iike
the Gestapo and search
any private residence?

39:25.396 --> 39:27.796
I am arguing I can search
any private residence

39:27.865 --> 39:29.924
that doesn't belong
to your client.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.163
And it will have no bearing
on these proceedings.

39:36.574 --> 39:41.011
While I deplore
the Assistant District
Attorney's actions,

39:41.612 --> 39:43.546
I am forced to agree

39:43.681 --> 39:48.380
that the illegal search
of Linda Cavanaugh's residence
is a civil tort.

39:48.586 --> 39:51.020
The defendant's privacy
was not violated,

39:51.088 --> 39:55.047
and therefore he has
no Iegal standing
to contest the search.

39:55.126 --> 39:58.118
Motion to suppress
the evidence is denied.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.895
Ms. Cabot, I scarcely
know where to begin.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.331
The Iiberties you have taken,

40:08.773 --> 40:12.265
the disdain you have shown
toward the Iaw in this court,

40:12.343 --> 40:16.143
are highly unethical
and a disgrace
to your position.

40:17.381 --> 40:21.613
Be assured,
I will recommend your office
to Iook into your actions.

40:22.086 --> 40:26.147
And you have done yourself
a real disservice
in my courtroom.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.287
I won't forget it.

40:38.035 --> 40:39.935
The tapes are in.
Good.

40:40.704 --> 40:42.137
What about you?

40:42.206 --> 40:44.367
Petrovsky acted
Iike I killed her dog.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.967
Just one more enemy
to add to the Iist.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.671
You took a big chance.

40:50.247 --> 40:54.479
You were never in jeopardy.
I made sure of that.
It will all fall on me.

40:54.552 --> 40:56.486
You should've told us.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.679
I am sorry.

40:59.757 --> 41:00.917
No, you're not.

41:00.991 --> 41:04.154
I am sorry you were ever
in the middle of this.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.256
But you're right.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.531
I'm not sorry about the rest.

41:13.504 --> 41:16.166
I have to go.
I have an arraignment.

41:20.511 --> 41:25.244
"Docket number 51024. People
v, Roy Johnathan Barnett,

41:25.816 --> 41:27.841
"Six counts Sodomy
in the Second Degree.

41:27.918 --> 41:30.614
"Six counts Use of a Child
in a Sexual Performance.

41:30.688 --> 41:33.748
"Six counts Promoting
an Obscene Sexual
Performance by a Child.

41:33.824 --> 41:37.157
"Six counts Possessing
an Obscene Sexual
performance by a Child.

41:37.228 --> 41:40.220
"Six counts Sexual abuse
in the Second Degree."

41:40.297 --> 41:41.992
PETROVSKY: How do you plead?

41:43.234 --> 41:46.692
DONNELLY: One month's
suspension without pay,
and that's a gift,

41:46.770 --> 41:48.294
so you can save
the arguments.

41:48.372 --> 41:49.805
I have no argument.

41:49.874 --> 41:53.970
Linda Cavanaugh decided not to
file a civil suit against you,
me, the police department,

41:54.044 --> 41:57.013
and the city
for your illegal search.

41:57.114 --> 41:59.207
So may I offer you
a big congratulations

41:59.283 --> 42:03.083
on successfully
setting civil Iiberties
back 200 years?

42:03.954 --> 42:05.922
It was her choice.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.617
Oh, she had a choice?

42:07.791 --> 42:09.258
Deciding her right to privacy

42:09.326 --> 42:12.022
wasn't as important
as putting her son's
molester in prison.

42:12.096 --> 42:15.190
No, AIex,
you decided that for her.

42:17.101 --> 42:19.399
And you think
that's just fine.

42:19.570 --> 42:21.936
You think that makes you
passionate and righteous.

42:22.006 --> 42:24.497
The ends justify the means
because you got away with it.

42:24.575 --> 42:26.805
I take full responsibility
for my actions.

42:26.877 --> 42:27.901
Of course.

42:27.978 --> 42:30.640
You did it for the greater
good, the safety of society.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.079
Bull. You did this for you.

42:32.149 --> 42:34.879
I did this for hundreds
of Barnett's future victims.

42:34.952 --> 42:37.284
One. One victim.

42:37.788 --> 42:40.313
Sam Cavanaugh. Did it work?

42:41.492 --> 42:43.460
Did it assuage your guilt?

42:45.329 --> 42:46.557
No.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.966
I don't think that's gonna
happen any time soon.

42:53.337 --> 42:55.134
I got news for you.

42:57.441 --> 43:00.569
It won't happen. Ever.
