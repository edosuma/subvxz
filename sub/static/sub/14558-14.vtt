WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:01.702
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

00:01.735 --> 00:05.773
(utensils clinking)

00:13.581 --> 00:15.049
(indistinct conversations,
soft music playing)

00:24.858 --> 00:25.526
Hey!

00:25.559 --> 00:27.295
Wallets, purses,
cell phones,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.097
everything
on the table.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.531
If you hold back,
you get shot.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.768
Do it, do it now!

00:36.670 --> 00:38.439
Too slow! Rapido!

00:38.472 --> 00:39.840
Don't think. Do it!

00:39.873 --> 00:41.742
(cell phone beeps)

00:41.775 --> 00:43.144
Everything on the table.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.512
I'll shoot you in the face.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.080
Don't look at me.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.081
(man grunts,
patrons scream)

00:47.115 --> 00:48.616
LAPD!
Don't move!

00:48.649 --> 00:50.050
Drop the weapon.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.620
Put your hands
in the air.

00:55.756 --> 00:56.724
Now!

00:56.757 --> 00:58.359
(speaks Spanish)

00:58.392 --> 01:00.261
(gun thuds onto floor)

01:00.294 --> 01:01.829
Put your hands

01:01.862 --> 01:03.164
in the air.

01:03.197 --> 01:03.731
Tranquilo.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.302
(people screaming
and shouting)

01:10.204 --> 01:11.772
Vamonos. Rapido!

01:13.141 --> 01:13.807
Let's go, let's go.

01:13.841 --> 01:14.808
Stay seated.

01:14.842 --> 01:15.676
You move, you die.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.146
(yelling in Spanish)

01:18.179 --> 01:19.747
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:19.780 --> 01:21.849
(classical music playing)

01:23.384 --> 01:25.753
(indistinct chatter)

01:29.157 --> 01:30.858
This is a disaster.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.693
This tux is very...

01:32.726 --> 01:34.162
It's very itchy.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.163
Stop whining.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.698
As promised, you look
like James Bond. You do.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.200
My circle-circle
tangent joke

01:39.233 --> 01:40.834
went right over
the senator's head.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.504
Come on. External similitude
humor isn't for everybody.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.139
I laughed my head off.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.640
Millie, I'm no
fundraiser...

01:46.674 --> 01:48.476
No, but you know
what you are?

01:48.509 --> 01:49.910
You're a fund magnet,
all right?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.280
Your five minutes
with the senator

01:52.313 --> 01:54.848
raised us a quarter
of a million dollar grant.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.550
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.419
- That's not too bad.
- It's fantastic.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.487
Are you kidding?

01:59.520 --> 02:02.523
That's five new jobs
in five minutes, all right?

02:02.556 --> 02:03.891
That is a real victory.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.360
Listen, these lobbyists,
these politicians, all right?

02:06.394 --> 02:08.662
They don't want to understand
what they're funding.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.897
They could care less.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.265
They're bored.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.500
They want to be impressed.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.934
You are so impressive.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.204
You're the one
and only Charlie Eppes--

02:16.237 --> 02:17.070
more dazzling in person

02:17.104 --> 02:19.773
than your legendary name
would suggest.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.575
Legendary.
Don't go too far.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.811
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.747
You reel them in, and I will
seal the deals, all right?

02:26.780 --> 02:29.683
In astronomical terms,
it's called syzygy.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.886
It's where all of the planets
are in perfect alignment.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.356
You, me...
(phone ringing)

02:35.389 --> 02:38.559
...and a room full of money
for the university.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.828
- What?
- Hey, Don.

02:40.861 --> 02:44.532
Well, I-I'm kind of in the
middle of something right now.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.367
Oh.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.636
Yeah. Okay.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.271
I'll be right there.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.439
I'm sorry.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.740
This is really important.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.907
Could have guessed.
I understand.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.443
See you.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.913
OFFICER: No way to predict where
they go next.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.482
COLBY: All right, yeah, I
understand.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.883
Well, listen, this
is Agent Eppes.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.918
- Why don't you brief him?
- Hey. How you doing?

03:04.952 --> 03:07.955
Uh, well, uh, we were chasing
a pattern robbery.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.292
Two guys, in masks,
with body armor, in and out

03:11.325 --> 03:12.993
of upscale restaurants
in under ten minutes.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.828
COLBY: They were grabbing
purses,

03:14.862 --> 03:16.464
wallets, cell phones.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.599
No jewelry,
never touched the register.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.967
They've been hitting
all over the Valley.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.303
No way to predict
where they'd go next.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.304
We had to split up.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.606
Two-man spotter teams
in a dozen restaurants

03:25.639 --> 03:27.675
with Rapid Deployment Teams
waiting for the signal.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.976
What, they didn't call it in?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.511
They did.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.012
We weren't fast enough.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.248
I screwed up.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.616
Bad plan,

03:35.649 --> 03:36.784
bad intel.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.985
(sighing):
I got these guys killed.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.086
All right, Jim,

03:39.119 --> 03:41.455
you just got to give yourself
a break, all right?

03:41.489 --> 03:42.690
Give yourself
some air here.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.325
You didn't get
anyone killed, all right?

03:44.358 --> 03:46.260
Just give us
a minute, all right?

03:46.294 --> 03:47.295
All right.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.596
So the, uh,
witnesses said

03:48.629 --> 03:50.931
that the officers
ID'd themselves.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.000
They were able
to disarm the robbers,

03:53.033 --> 03:54.668
but then two customers
over here

03:54.702 --> 03:56.704
popped up with handguns
and opened fire.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.473
And they collected their
bullet casings before they left.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.909
So, what, they come in,
they scope it out,

04:01.942 --> 04:03.277
they signal the other two...

04:03.311 --> 04:05.413
Don.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.348
Nice.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.416
Very, uh..

04:08.449 --> 04:09.717
James Bond.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.584
No.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.686
Yeah, no, I didn't
think so, either.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.022
So, two police
officers were hurt.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.326
They were killed, actually,
in a robbery here.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.027
There have been eight
restaurant robberies,

04:20.060 --> 04:21.995
all at upscale places.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.664
Hmm.
This is pretty spread out.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.699
I mean, I can tell you

04:25.733 --> 04:27.701
that no geographic
pattern jumps out at me.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.703
Maybe with more data
on methods and times...

04:29.737 --> 04:30.871
DON:
What about those

04:30.904 --> 04:32.873
bank robberies
you predicted? Remember?

04:32.906 --> 04:34.575
Was that the time you got shot?

04:34.608 --> 04:35.543
Yeah.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.378
I mean, they killed two cops
here, you know?

04:37.411 --> 04:40.348
So, needless to say, we'd like
to shut these guys down

04:40.381 --> 04:41.315
before they hit again.

04:41.349 --> 04:44.284
I'll find them for you.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.827
MEGAN:
So,

04:53.861 --> 04:54.895
we went through
the reservations.

04:54.928 --> 04:55.529
The inside couple used
a fake name, bogus number.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.397
Yeah. Well,
go figure.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.699
But I went back,
and I cross-checked it

04:58.732 --> 04:59.767
with the other robberies.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.570
I figured, you know,
if they're part of the M.O.,

05:02.603 --> 05:03.637
maybe they screwed up
somewhere--

05:03.671 --> 05:05.973
they used the same name,
or the same phone number.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.741
- Right. And?
- And they didn't screw up.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.042
I have nothing.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.077
(clears throat)
Getting anywhere

05:10.110 --> 05:10.744
with the profiles?

05:10.778 --> 05:12.613
Three guys
and one girl.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.583
It really could be any number
of dynamics, so...

05:15.616 --> 05:17.718
unless a witness can remember
something other than

05:17.751 --> 05:19.720
big guns
and Hispanic accents, um...

05:19.753 --> 05:20.854
- Right.
- COLBY: Think we know

05:20.888 --> 05:22.490
why they're taking
the cell phones.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.791
DAVID: Victims can't cancel
their credit cards

05:23.824 --> 05:25.058
before they're maxed out.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.027
They've been getting
over 60 grand a hit.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.929
How are they burning the cards
so fast?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.063
They're doing it online.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.666
Uh, victims are being charged
for big ticket items:

05:32.700 --> 05:34.702
plasma TVs, hotel
reservations.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.504
Right. Well, what about
tracing the goods?

05:36.537 --> 05:37.705
COLBY:
Well, that's the thing.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.906
There aren't any goods.
They're setting up

05:38.939 --> 05:40.708
these dummy Internet
corporations,

05:40.741 --> 05:41.675
they're running the charges,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.377
and then shutting them down
the next day.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.145
That's money laundering
in the new millennium.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.648
Yeah. So I got our techs
on the service providers.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.082
See if we can get some names,

05:49.116 --> 05:50.684
find out
who's building the sites,

05:50.718 --> 05:51.852
and where
the money's going.

05:51.885 --> 05:52.686
Wait. You remember that guy?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.522
Uh, what was the name,
Ricky Jones?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.156
He was hitting all those
Beverly Hills jewelry stores,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.725
and they were leaving
the gold and taking the...

05:57.758 --> 05:58.859
the customers' credit cards?

05:58.892 --> 05:59.427
I know what you're talking
about.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.594
I'll reach out to him.

06:00.628 --> 06:01.829
MEGAN: You know, I still believe

06:01.862 --> 06:03.597
most criminals
are not perfect at first.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.733
You know, they make mistakes,
they leave

06:05.766 --> 06:07.935
evidence behind.

06:07.968 --> 06:12.540
And now that we know the M.O.'s,
maybe we should go back and look

06:12.573 --> 06:14.475
at those first robberies
again.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.778
Yeah.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.580
Why-Why don't you guys go, huh?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.416
Sweet.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.452
FBI's paying for lunch.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.753
(quiet laugh)

06:28.789 --> 06:30.090
No.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.059
No...

06:32.092 --> 06:33.494
Moron.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.629
That's absolutely incorrect.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.498
Makes no sense whatso...

06:37.531 --> 06:38.699
(gasps)

06:38.732 --> 06:39.700
Oh!

06:39.733 --> 06:40.668
I'm sorry.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.135
(laughing):
I didn't mean to startle you.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.472
(gasps)
In Antarctica, we're used

06:44.505 --> 06:46.139
to doing everything
very quietly.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.875
It's like
a-a big

06:47.908 --> 06:49.810
library with penguins.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.745
Sorry about leaving last night.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.481
Oh, no.
Don't be.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.882
Actually, the school made out
very well.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.650
You made us a lot of dough.
Thank you.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.686
Oh, yeah?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.854
Interesting analysis, huh?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.923
Yeah. Used it a couple years ago

07:02.956 --> 07:05.826
to predict bank robberies,
but it's not quite

07:05.859 --> 07:07.728
lending itself
to the current problem

07:07.761 --> 07:09.029
as easily as I'd hoped.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.731
You know-- and
don't take this

07:10.764 --> 07:11.765
as a criticism, but...

07:11.799 --> 07:13.634
Is it criticism?
Yes.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.202
Okay then. A couple months ago,

07:15.235 --> 07:17.771
I read about the system used
to differentiate

07:17.805 --> 07:19.773
between institutional
targets-- you know,

07:19.807 --> 07:22.810
like banks and stuff--
and civilian targets-- like a...

07:22.843 --> 07:23.777
- Like restaurants?
- Yeah.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.978
Wait. Are-are you...

07:25.012 --> 07:27.247
Are you talking about Homeland
Security's threat matrix?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.348
Yeah.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.951
I think it might serve your
purposes a bit better.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.186
Yeah, there was an article
about a year ago.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.255
Mm-hmm.
It was this one.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.990
(laughs)

07:37.024 --> 07:38.526
How did you know?

07:38.559 --> 07:39.693
I don't know.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.928
How'd I know?
Let's see.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.030
You run off
to help the FBI, and, uh,

07:43.063 --> 07:45.866
I read an article about two
police officers being killed.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.501
My advanced math degree
allows me

07:47.535 --> 07:49.202
to put two plus two together.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.073
Professor... Millie, thank you.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.141
You're welcome.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.408
Oh, and after you left,

07:55.442 --> 07:58.746
I spoke to a couple lobbyists
from MacMillan Pharmaceuticals.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.113
Apparently, they're looking
for a reason

08:00.147 --> 08:01.715
to dump their excess riches

08:01.749 --> 08:03.584
into our humble coffers.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.752
A reason...
Mm-hmm.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.986
Such as...?
Oh, I don't know.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.756
Maybe having one of the world's
greatest minds as point man

08:08.789 --> 08:10.858
on their new pharmacokinetic
modeling project.

08:10.891 --> 08:11.925
Talking about me? My mind?

08:11.959 --> 08:14.528
Now, you know, they just require
a little dazzling.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.963
No tuxedo required.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.866
Okay. Just set it up,
and I'll-I'll be there.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.801
Great. Done.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.205
You know, Sinclair,
every time you pull me out

08:25.238 --> 08:27.975
to pick my brain,
my credibility drops.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.043
Well, yeah,
you have cred,

08:30.077 --> 08:33.213
and you have good word
with the parole board.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.883
You have a choice, brother.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.261
Well, you're not
looking local.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.264
I don't know of any crews
that ambush cops.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.033
You think it was an ambush?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.101
Oh, hell, yeah.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.869
This type of
work attracts

08:55.903 --> 08:57.104
two kinds-- the ones

08:57.137 --> 08:58.639
that are about money,

08:58.672 --> 08:59.907
and the ones that
are about violence.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.042
If it's about money,
you might hit somebody,

09:02.075 --> 09:03.911
show him his own blood,

09:03.944 --> 09:05.979
but you don't pull the trigger.
All that gets

09:06.013 --> 09:07.347
is more panic
and less time

09:07.380 --> 09:08.849
to get clear.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.317
Okay, so you think
these guys--

09:10.350 --> 09:11.885
this-this crew--
they're about violence.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.687
No.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.855
I don't think so, no.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.991
They're not wild enough.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.993
Ricky, dude, help me out, man.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.061
You're doing business.

09:21.094 --> 09:24.164
Suddenly there's cops
everywhere you want to be.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.900
Most people in my line of work
will either

09:26.934 --> 09:28.802
lay low or move on,

09:28.836 --> 09:30.704
but these guys

09:30.738 --> 09:34.341
decided to send you a statement.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.845
You think they're trying
to back us off by killing cops?

09:37.878 --> 09:38.946
Who'd be dumb enough
to think that?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.113
I don't know,

09:40.147 --> 09:43.216
but they're a different kind
of crazy.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.054
(door opening)

09:47.087 --> 09:48.221
Hey.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.890
Thanks. Hey.
How's it going?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.324
Oh, I don't know.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.126
Um, how'd it go at the
restaurant? You find anything?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.162
Just an overdone steak.

09:55.195 --> 09:55.963
The owner said

09:55.996 --> 09:57.397
these guys knew
the layout, 'cause

09:57.430 --> 09:59.132
they clipped the wires
to the security camera.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.702
MEGAN: If there was a learning
curve, it was somewhere else.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.870
All she could remember

10:02.903 --> 10:04.204
were Spanish accents--
one so heavy

10:04.237 --> 10:05.673
she could barely
understand him.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.074
COLBY:
Yeah, they knew their guns,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.743
they maintained discipline,
policed their brass.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.144
I'm thinking it's possible

10:11.178 --> 10:12.412
they might have been
ex-military.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.082
Right, and this guy says that
they were sending us a message.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.283
You know, soldiers

10:16.316 --> 10:19.019
from an unstable political
environment would be more likely

10:19.052 --> 10:21.088
to go head-to-head
with authority figures.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.189
- Right, and the accents.
- Yeah.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.957
I mean, we've trained a lot

10:23.991 --> 10:26.159
of Central and South American
Special Forces over the years.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.728
It could have been a group
up here on a rotation,

10:27.761 --> 10:28.896
and they got the lay
of the land,

10:28.929 --> 10:30.097
and then decided that

10:30.130 --> 10:31.198
robbery pays better
than soldiering.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.801
Sure. Why don't you run with
that, see what we get?

10:33.834 --> 10:34.234
Okay.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.869
All right...

10:35.903 --> 10:37.671
Um, I saw your envelope.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.839
From Trauma Recovery.

10:38.872 --> 10:39.940
I got the same thing last month.

10:39.973 --> 10:40.941
It's on the spree killing?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.142
Yeah. It's ridiculous.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.277
I mean, you, know, the Review
Board already cleared me.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.046
Yeah, but, you know,
the thing about therapy--

10:46.079 --> 10:47.715
if you put a little bit in,
you get a lot out.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.782
Yeah, well, the guy better
sign the thing

10:48.816 --> 10:49.850
and get me out of there.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.121
CHARLIE: This threat matrix
isn't quite right yet.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.189
It's set to predict
the unpredictable--

10:56.223 --> 10:59.993
terrorist attacks--
but robberies, they're...

11:00.027 --> 11:02.896
they have their own unique set
of characteristics, you know?

11:02.930 --> 11:05.298
Why did you start out with the
threat matrix to begin with?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.868
It was Millie's suggestion.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.303
Oh.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.741
So after all that kicking
and screaming about the tuxedo,

11:13.774 --> 11:15.342
it sounds like you guys
did some bonding.

11:15.375 --> 11:20.347
Yeah, I mean, I have to say,
it wasn't so bad, you know?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.983
I mean, you dazzle them
with a little Pythagorean wit

11:23.016 --> 11:25.152
and their checkbooks
crack open.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.020
I'll tell you, if we can get
this MacMillan

11:27.054 --> 11:29.156
pharmacokinetic modeling
project, well,

11:29.189 --> 11:30.190
who knows what else the...

11:30.223 --> 11:31.792
MacMillan Pharmaceuticals?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.326
Yeah.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.262
What?

11:35.295 --> 11:36.897
I mean, they have a reputation

11:36.930 --> 11:38.031
for exploiting
Third World countries.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.833
They'll charge $500

11:39.867 --> 11:41.902
for a vial of AIDS serum
that costs 50 cents.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.103
I didn't know that.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.842
I'll talk to Millie about it.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.077
I think that would be wise.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.212
What's missing here?

11:52.245 --> 11:53.213
Something's missing here.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.782
I don't know.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.283
Uh, food?

11:56.316 --> 11:57.517
Where are those menus?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.252
Right.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.487
(drawer sliding)

12:00.520 --> 12:02.222
(paper rustling)

12:11.865 --> 12:13.834
That's it.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.435
Hey, Dave, did you find
anything on the money trail?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.970
Yeah.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.206
I followed the phony Web
site and credit card charges

12:19.239 --> 12:22.976
back to an anonymous offshore
bank account in Nauru.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.477
Nauru?

12:24.511 --> 12:26.313
A small island in
the South Pacific.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.516
Bank's refused to cooperate
unless we can prove

12:29.549 --> 12:31.484
that specific deposits
came from a felony.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.320
We can't point
to specific deposits

12:33.353 --> 12:35.255
if they won't let us
look at the accounts.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.990
And that particular
Catch-22

12:37.024 --> 12:39.359
has made the small
island of Nauru

12:39.392 --> 12:41.261
a favorite
financial center

12:41.294 --> 12:43.196
for all kinds of
high-end lowlifes.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.332
That's great.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.835
Yeah, I came up empty
on the ex-military angle, too.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.470
Seems over the past 30 years,
we've been a foreign exchange

12:50.503 --> 12:53.140
program for just about
every country south of Texas.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.375
Trained paramilitary groups,
special forces--

12:55.408 --> 12:58.145
as soon as the country turns
or the army stops paying...

12:58.178 --> 12:59.947
A lot of unemployed soldiers
who need work.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.048
All right.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.150
Maybe Charlie could help us
narrow down the list.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.319
So Amita and I

13:06.353 --> 13:08.588
adapted Homeland Security's
threat matrix

13:08.621 --> 13:10.423
to examine
these eight robberies

13:10.457 --> 13:13.093
by target, time,
location and security.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.363
We came up with this list
of similar targets.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.265
Then we went even further,
evaluating

13:18.298 --> 13:21.001
the restaurants in terms
of architecture and access

13:21.034 --> 13:22.970
to fast escape routes.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.307
It looks pretty much
like the LAPD's list.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.242
Right, so I figured
I was on the right path,

13:29.276 --> 13:30.377
but set theory
wasn't really working,

13:30.410 --> 13:31.111
so then I applied

13:31.144 --> 13:33.446
multidimensional
graph Laplacians

13:33.480 --> 13:34.982
and PageRank matrices...

13:35.015 --> 13:37.117
Yeah, that's what
I would've done, too.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.585
Well, of course you would've
because that's a way

13:38.618 --> 13:40.153
to investigate
a group of things

13:40.187 --> 13:42.422
and identify
their shared properties, right?

13:42.455 --> 13:43.790
Think about a refrigerator

13:43.823 --> 13:48.896
stocked with groceries--
a steak, wine, apples, a pie.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.430
Now, each of those items
is unique

13:50.463 --> 13:53.500
and can be purchased
at several different stores,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.936
but more likely, a family makes
a single shopping trip.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.338
You figured out
where the robbers

13:58.371 --> 14:00.473
are shopping for
their targets?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.342
Simon's L.A. Restaurant Guide.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.377
Yeah. The eight restaurants
they attacked

14:04.411 --> 14:07.514
scored 93% or higher
on food quality and price.

14:07.547 --> 14:11.218
Cost I get-- these guys, they're
after the fattest credit cards.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.887
And the higher the food scores,
the trendier restaurant,

14:13.921 --> 14:15.422
the fattest credit cards.

14:15.455 --> 14:19.026
Then we used those variables
to narrow it down even further.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.028
So you think
one of these restaurants

14:21.061 --> 14:22.395
is their next target?

14:22.429 --> 14:25.032
Right, and you can't cover
all 15, so...

14:25.065 --> 14:28.168
this site
has the highest probability.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.440
(overlapping chatter)

14:39.679 --> 14:40.647
Go, go, go.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.649
Move, move.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.483
(speaking Spanish):

14:57.530 --> 14:59.466
Wallets, purses, cell phones.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.434
(patrons screaming)
On the table now!

15:01.468 --> 15:02.502
Now!

15:08.008 --> 15:09.342
Everything goes
in the bag.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.543
If you hold back,

15:10.577 --> 15:12.512
you'll get shot.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.614
(phones ringing)

15:43.176 --> 15:44.711
DAVID: Three guns through the
front door.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.513
These guys didn't even bother
with the couple

15:46.546 --> 15:47.747
in the back this time.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.681
Double tap.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.184
So it looks like an execution.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.552
They killed two cops
to get away last time.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.521
Wonder what this guy did?

15:54.554 --> 15:57.224
Could be trying to send
us a message, you know.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.692
Third World countries,
paramilitaries and drug gangs,

15:59.726 --> 16:01.028
they'll execute civilians

16:01.061 --> 16:03.496
just to warn
the local authorities

16:03.530 --> 16:06.266
if they don't back off,
they got to expect more bodies.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.101
Yeah, well,
it ain't going to work here.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.736
CHARLIE: They didn't hit the
most likely location.

16:09.769 --> 16:10.837
DAVID:
Charlie, you got the date

16:10.870 --> 16:12.539
and time right, man,
you just missed the exact place

16:12.572 --> 16:13.473
where they were going to hit,
that's all.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.475
No, no, I actually
missed something else.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.345
Look, this place barely showed
up on my threat matrix.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.647
If I'm off by
this large a margin,

16:20.680 --> 16:23.016
there is no way I can
pinpoint these attacks.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.017
All right, Charlie,
just relax, okay?

16:24.051 --> 16:26.019
First of all, it's not
your fault, you know?

16:26.053 --> 16:26.953
Just keep working
and do your thing.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.357
I mean, come here,
don't worry about it.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.060
MEGAN: The State Department had
no luck

16:33.093 --> 16:34.061
with Nauru.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.395
Their courts turned down

16:35.428 --> 16:36.396
our application
for bank records.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.032
Island's whole economy
is pinned on banking.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.034
These guys are just
protecting their asset.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.335
Yeah, but they're making
our life so difficult,

16:42.369 --> 16:43.470
'cause with no
account information,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.072
we have no identifiers.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.806
There's no way to trace
back to the killers.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.740
Well, try Treasury.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.941
I mean, we've shut down
offshores before.

16:48.975 --> 16:53.046
We just need a soft spot,
someone in L.A. we can pressure.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.747
You have a thing
with the psychologist?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.649
Yeah.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.286
I know this is just
an appointment for you.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.621
Okay. But?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.723
But you never know
what's going to happen

17:03.756 --> 17:05.492
till you walk in that door.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.795
Think I need help?

17:08.828 --> 17:12.399
I don't think they've made
the person yet who doesn't.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.501
(scoffing):
This is a waste of time.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.407
CHARLIE:
Millie.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.641
Hey.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.643
Oh. Professor Eppes.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.378
What can I do for you?

17:25.412 --> 17:28.115
Oh. How goes
your threat matrixing?

17:28.148 --> 17:29.582
It didn't work.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.251
Really?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.586
Oh, wow. I thought
it was a good approach.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.723
Yeah, I know;
so did I...

17:36.756 --> 17:39.792
What do you know about
MacMillan Pharmaceuticals?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.828
MacMillan. Oh, well, I know

17:41.861 --> 17:43.830
that their pharmacokinetic
modeling

17:43.863 --> 17:47.467
could save the lives
of the-- what-- 16,000 people

17:47.500 --> 17:48.801
who overdose on simple,

17:48.835 --> 17:50.137
over-the-counter painkillers
every year.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.139
That's what I know.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.406
Well, did you know
that drug companies

17:53.440 --> 17:54.774
exploit Third World countries.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.643
They sell them

17:56.676 --> 17:58.345
overpriced and expired
medication...

17:58.378 --> 18:02.682
Look, these companies, they're
not demons, they're not angels.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.884
They are profit-seeking
concerns--

18:04.917 --> 18:07.887
some better than others,
some not so great.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.158
It just seems to me
that it should be as important

18:11.191 --> 18:14.794
to know where the money's been
as where it's going.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.896
I've done my homework,
Charlie, thank you.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.898
As corporations go,
I would characterize them

18:18.931 --> 18:22.469
as relatively responsible now.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.770
Relative?

18:23.803 --> 18:24.771
Yeah.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.439
Relative to what?

18:26.473 --> 18:28.708
See?
I should've known better

18:28.741 --> 18:31.578
than to try to get that word
past a fellow math geek, huh?

18:31.611 --> 18:32.612
TouchГ©.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.254
Have a seat.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.225
No, I have
the originals.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.926
So...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.895
Look, is there
some kind of problem?

18:48.928 --> 18:50.930
There's not a problem.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.200
FBI just wanted us to talk.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.601
What about?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.870
Anything.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.342
Look, I don't hate my dad,
all right?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.644
I like women, I respect them
as people,

19:04.677 --> 19:06.413
I don't get off
on pulling my gun.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.315
What else do you want
to talk about?

19:08.348 --> 19:09.882
How do you feel
when you pull your gun?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.684
(scoffing):
Give me a break.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.686
You brought it up.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.688
Listen...

19:15.722 --> 19:17.957
Yes, I shot Crystal Hoyle,

19:17.990 --> 19:20.827
a spree killer
who kidnapped one of my agents

19:20.860 --> 19:22.729
and was driving straight
at a roadblock

19:22.762 --> 19:24.297
with a car full of grenades.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.333
There was a trained sniper
on the scene.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.436
An Agent, uh... Edgerton.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.871
Why do you think
he didn't take the shot?

19:31.904 --> 19:33.306
Well, uh, 'cause
I took the shot first.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.140
Because you're a better shot?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.575
- No.
- Oh, well, I don't get it.

19:35.608 --> 19:36.976
Let me tell you
something, all right?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.312
Every single day,
I have to make decisions

19:39.346 --> 19:40.913
that affect a lot
of people's lives.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.216
Now, I don't expect you
to understand that.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.351
I expect you to just

19:44.384 --> 19:46.219
sign this document
and let me

19:46.253 --> 19:49.222
get back to my job,
please, sir.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.957
Why do you think I wouldn't
understand what you do?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.024
'Cause it's not a textbook.

19:52.058 --> 19:55.328
If you're not in it,
it's impossible to explain.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.431
Well, I wasn't in the FBI.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.599
Yeah, well...

19:59.632 --> 20:01.634
But I was undercover narcotics
in East L.A.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.802
I did two years

20:02.835 --> 20:05.372
on a CRASH team in Compton, too.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.374
Well, you know, I'm sorry.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.941
I didn't know that.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.109
No, you didn't.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.545
You're gonna walk in here
with no respect for my work,

20:12.579 --> 20:13.713
expecting me to respect yours.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.415
No, man, that's not it.
It's just...

20:15.448 --> 20:19.386
Thing is, I'm hung over,
and I'm hungry,

20:19.419 --> 20:21.388
and you are my last session
before lunch,

20:21.421 --> 20:23.890
and I was ready to run through
a half dozen routine questions,

20:23.923 --> 20:27.694
listen to your routine answers,
and walk you out that door,

20:27.727 --> 20:30.497
and now I don't know.

20:30.530 --> 20:34.367
(phone ringing)

20:34.401 --> 20:36.703
You got to take that?

20:36.736 --> 20:37.904
(phone beeps off)

20:37.937 --> 20:40.273
No, I don't.

20:43.042 --> 20:46.012
So, I hear that, uh,
you and Millie had a, uh,

20:46.045 --> 20:49.982
philosophical discussion
about ends and means?

20:50.016 --> 20:53.520
What, do you and Millie just
talk about me a lot?

20:53.553 --> 20:55.288
You're a very interesting topic,
Charlie.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.658
Yeah, so, what do you think...
about MacMillan Pharmaceuticals?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.427
- What do you think?
- Oh.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.462
Commerce versus ethics, huh?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.497
You know, I
spent 30 years

21:04.531 --> 21:06.466
dealing with that very subject,

21:06.499 --> 21:08.468
and I still don't have
a good answer,

21:08.501 --> 21:10.603
and I wouldn't trust anyone
that said they did.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.072
But if budget's
not important,

21:13.105 --> 21:16.008
then you can judge a project
on any grounds you want--

21:16.042 --> 21:17.710
you know, morals, ethics.

21:17.744 --> 21:21.348
Of course, if I had turned down
all those corporations

21:21.381 --> 21:22.782
with a spotty track record,

21:22.815 --> 21:25.652
a lot of low income housing
would never have been built.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.620
Well, Dad, if I take the money,

21:27.654 --> 21:30.923
then I'm just tacitly approving
of their methods.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.460
I feel if we can turn
some of these giant

21:33.493 --> 21:36.028
corporations down, then we can
get them to change their ways.

21:36.062 --> 21:39.098
Oh, I applaud your idealism,
Charlie.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.100
Got it from you.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.503
Experience has tempered
my activism with pragmatism,

21:43.536 --> 21:45.004
and I would
like to think

21:45.037 --> 21:47.440
the wisdom
to continually balance the two.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.509
CHARLIE: And which way do you
think

21:49.542 --> 21:50.543
this balances out?

21:50.577 --> 21:51.944
I have no idea,

21:51.978 --> 21:53.913
but right now, I'm
just an angry renter,

21:53.946 --> 21:55.582
wondering when his
landlord is gonna

21:55.615 --> 21:58.551
send the spider people
around again.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.126
You know what?

22:07.159 --> 22:09.095
I have to go.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.597
Uh. Don't worry.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.499
I'll load the laundry.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.441
Hey, where is everybody?

22:21.474 --> 22:23.576
Hey, what do you mean,
they're working.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.612
Hey, look, I know I screwed up.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.479
Come on, hey, Charlie,

22:26.513 --> 22:29.649
look, seriously,
with all you do for us?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.651
Well, my math wasn't wrong,
but my assumptions were wrong.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.152
You know, I assumed
that all the data

22:33.185 --> 22:34.554
belonged to the same set.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.888
Right.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.591
I mean, it's like,
it's like searching

22:38.625 --> 22:39.792
for a spider
or its prey,

22:39.826 --> 22:42.529
by studying its web.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.667
You see, we use tension values
of the silk web,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.936
like vibrations
and weather conditions,

22:49.969 --> 22:53.105
and other variables to reliably
predict where the spider is

22:53.139 --> 22:55.542
and where the next insect is
going to get tangled.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.809
However,
there are some species...

22:56.843 --> 22:59.078
that build overlapping webs.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.614
You see, I was assuming
that only one robbery team

23:01.648 --> 23:03.816
was responsible for
all that data, and that,

23:03.850 --> 23:05.418
that's where I was wrong.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.019
So you're saying it's two teams
working together?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.921
Not together, in tandem.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.657
Right, planning together
but executing separately.

23:10.690 --> 23:11.658
That's all you
need to do...

23:11.691 --> 23:13.660
is untangle those webs.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.001
(speaking Spanish)

23:25.037 --> 23:27.640
(shouting, rapid gunfire)

23:29.909 --> 23:30.643
FBI!

23:48.995 --> 23:51.664
DAVID:
What's your name?

23:51.698 --> 23:54.534
What are you doing here?

23:54.567 --> 23:56.202
When did you...

23:56.235 --> 23:58.838
When did you get
in this country?

23:58.871 --> 24:01.841
(over speaker):
You want to play games?

24:01.874 --> 24:06.546
DON (over speaker):
What's your name?

24:06.579 --> 24:08.548
When did you enter the country?

24:08.581 --> 24:09.549
(tapping fingers)

24:09.582 --> 24:10.483
Why are you here?

24:14.186 --> 24:14.954
You can't talk?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.489
Come on, tell me.
Where you from?

24:16.523 --> 24:19.826
When did you sneak
into this country?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.728
We've got to put
an end to this.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.129
You want to be in there?

24:23.162 --> 24:25.865
They're clearly trained
in counter interrogation.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.734
Probably by us.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.769
See the way they're sitting,
their body posture,

24:29.802 --> 24:32.705
they're refusing
to make eye contact...

24:32.739 --> 24:34.907
the tapping on the tables--

24:34.941 --> 24:38.811
they're just trying to throw
off the interrogator's rhythm.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.747
We're all operating
off the same manuals.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.750
All right, so, I mean,
nobody's talking, right?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.184
No, we got no
hits on Interpol,

24:45.217 --> 24:46.886
we got nothing on
the U.S. database.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.055
They're... ghosts.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.890
And your web thing,
you think that's going to help

24:50.923 --> 24:51.791
us find the other team, or no?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.626
No, I doubt it.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.894
By catching one team,

24:54.927 --> 24:55.828
we've already sort of changed
the variables.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.863
If there are more robberies,
then, yeah,

24:56.896 --> 24:59.165
maybe I can revisit
the threat matrix, but...

24:59.198 --> 25:00.900
The minivan they
used wasn't stolen.

25:00.933 --> 25:01.768
The car registration

25:01.801 --> 25:04.604
came back to a
Jaime Lopez, deceased.

25:04.637 --> 25:05.805
So it's another dead end?

25:05.838 --> 25:07.273
Nah, not exactly.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.875
In addition to
robbing and killing,

25:08.908 --> 25:10.176
our guys are scofflaws.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.845
Four parking tickets
on the 900 block of Alvarado

25:12.879 --> 25:13.913
in the past five weeks.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.716
And only six houses
on that block are occupied,

25:16.749 --> 25:18.284
and four by families
that have been there

25:18.317 --> 25:19.385
15 years or more.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.988
And one of the other two
houses belongs to this guy--

25:23.355 --> 25:25.892
Bernardo Infante.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.827
MEGAN:
Should that name ring a bell?

25:27.860 --> 25:28.928
Only if you served
in the Mexican Army.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.297
Up until last year,
he was a colonel

25:31.330 --> 25:32.298
in the Corps
of Military Police.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.734
Now, they regard interrogation
as an art form,

25:34.767 --> 25:36.803
so he would be the guy
to teach you how to resist it.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.270
And what's he
doing up here?

25:38.304 --> 25:39.138
Believe it or not,

25:39.171 --> 25:41.874
the guy's an elementary
school teacher.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.843
All right, go for it--
shake him up, see what he does.

25:58.290 --> 26:02.094
So what's eating you?

26:02.128 --> 26:03.896
Nothing.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.298
Donny, even for you,
this is taciturn.

26:06.332 --> 26:09.669
I just got to go see this guy.

26:09.702 --> 26:10.770
What guy?

26:10.803 --> 26:12.038
This hard-ass
psychologist.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.372
Because of the
Hoyle shooting.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.207
You know, like I'm trigger-happy
or something.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.744
Is that what he said?

26:17.777 --> 26:19.746
Basically.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.781
And what did you say?

26:21.814 --> 26:23.315
I don't have time
for this crap.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.184
Well, maybe you
ought to make time.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.920
Yeah, well, here we go--
what, you, too?

26:27.954 --> 26:31.223
A) I don't see anything wrong
with talking to someone.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.959
And B) maybe he
ought to understand

26:32.992 --> 26:34.827
that you're the one
that will always take the shot.

26:34.861 --> 26:35.828
Yeah, thank you, you know?

26:35.862 --> 26:37.764
I mean, I was doing my job.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.900
Well, it's also Megan's job,
David's job and Colby's.

26:42.001 --> 26:42.969
It seems like you save

26:43.002 --> 26:45.004
all the dirty jobs for yourself.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.873
Dad, I do what has
to be done, period.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.075
You know, it's not like
I like doing the dirty work.

26:49.108 --> 26:53.880
Don, I've always been proud
of the way

26:53.913 --> 26:55.147
that you shoulder
other people's burdens.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.917
I mean, even when you were a kid
and you sacrificed for Charlie.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.853
But if you're going to
regard your life's work

27:00.887 --> 27:02.321
as just a series
of dirty jobs

27:02.354 --> 27:04.390
then I think
it's worth talking about.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.059
I mean, to... someone.

27:10.262 --> 27:14.000
(children shouting,
talking playfully)

27:24.476 --> 27:25.812
Don't.

27:28.414 --> 27:29.882
FBI.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.850
Agent Sinclair.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.985
Agent Granger.
We need you to come downtown

27:33.019 --> 27:33.886
with us right now.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.922
And then?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.990
Just stop moving,
SeГ±or Infante.

27:38.024 --> 27:38.958
Don't make another move
toward these kids.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.962
What do you want?

27:46.799 --> 27:49.035
Are these friends of yours?

27:49.068 --> 27:53.005
No, are they
friends of yours?

27:53.039 --> 27:54.741
We need you to come downtown.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.209
We want to ask you a few
questions about these people.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.879
Those aren't people.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.281
(woman speaking Spanish)

28:04.851 --> 28:07.153
Death squads?

28:07.186 --> 28:08.354
That's what you
call them here, right?

28:08.387 --> 28:10.456
Men and women who kill
outside the law.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.993
No one kills outside the law.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.997
Well, here, perhaps not.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.299
In Mexico, it's different.

28:20.332 --> 28:23.002
I was a colonel.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.372
I had to watch
these death squads work.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.775
In one village,
they killed every man,

28:28.808 --> 28:31.210
every woman...

28:31.243 --> 28:33.512
and almost every child.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.247
Do you know who the men
in these death squads are?

28:35.281 --> 28:36.883
I know their type.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.118
I trained their type.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.387
Convincing myself
that my only duty

28:41.420 --> 28:44.023
was to be a good soldier
and follow orders.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.359
(sighing):
This village that I mentioned,

28:47.393 --> 28:49.495
three young children survived.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.098
That's six young eyes

28:52.131 --> 28:53.966
that saw the faces
behind the masks.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.268
Now, as a soldier,
I had a choice to make.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.404
Turn these children
over to the death squads,

28:58.437 --> 29:00.506
or smuggle them to Los Angeles.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.508
These men followed you
all the way up north,

29:02.541 --> 29:03.709
for the children?

29:03.742 --> 29:08.447
They tried to wring words
from a man who taught silence.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.783
They would have killed me,

29:10.817 --> 29:13.986
but they knew if they did,
my secret would die with me.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.088
They watch me.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.125
Waiting to see
if I make a mistake.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.093
Give over the ones
that they want to kill.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.863
So why the robberies?

29:23.896 --> 29:29.235
In Mexico, they killed farmers
for coins in their cushions,

29:29.268 --> 29:31.137
or gold fillings
in their teeth.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.905
But here, they're with those
with real money.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.907
If you trained these men,
did you teach them how

29:34.941 --> 29:36.142
how to launder
the money as well?

29:36.175 --> 29:40.346
There are lawyers here
in Los Angeles,

29:40.379 --> 29:43.850
men who you go to when you
need your money cleaned,

29:43.883 --> 29:46.953
to run your operations...

29:46.986 --> 29:49.021
my operations.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.994
We can help keep
the children safe.

29:55.027 --> 30:00.466
You can't keep your own police
safe from these animals.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.601
DON:
This is unbelievable.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.304
All he gives us
is a... a list of lawyers?

30:05.337 --> 30:06.939
He doesn't trust us.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.475
I mean, I don't agree with him,
but I understand him.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.043
Right.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.578
Got a file from the Treasury
on our offshore.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.612
These type of banks

30:13.645 --> 30:16.983
require a legal go-between
to open an account.

30:17.016 --> 30:17.984
It's called an Introducer.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.185
What's an Introducer?

30:19.218 --> 30:21.153
It's a fence for rich people.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.254
And for legit offshores,

30:22.288 --> 30:24.123
it's a way of insulating
themselves from dirty money.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.058
What about the ones
that aren't legit?

30:26.092 --> 30:27.459
The ones that funnel
stolen credit card charges

30:27.493 --> 30:29.128
from dummy Web sites?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.362
Well, they still
need an Introducer,

30:30.396 --> 30:32.331
just one that's not so clean.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.900
There's a list of
dirty go-betweens

30:33.933 --> 30:35.534
for our offshore in there.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.403
We have a match
to Infante's list.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.237
Yeah?

30:38.270 --> 30:40.106
Luis Salazar.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.340
The DEA suspects

30:41.373 --> 30:43.943
he spent the better part of
the '90s laundering drug money.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.445
Contacts with
paramilitaries...

30:46.478 --> 30:48.114
The cartels hired him
for their security.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.515
Sounds like the Death
Squads' banker.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.517
Yeah. Does it say
where he is now?

30:51.550 --> 30:52.584
In a penthouse
downtown.

30:52.618 --> 30:55.254
Wow, help the cop killers
and live the good life.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.188
Hey, go pick him up.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.658
DAVID:
Luis Salazar!

30:59.691 --> 31:02.161
FBI!
We want to...

31:04.296 --> 31:06.298
Heads up.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.903
Unlocked door at the shady
lawyer's apartment.

31:10.937 --> 31:13.039
It's never a good sign.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.274
The guy needs
to hire a maid service.

31:15.307 --> 31:19.145
Guy needs to
hire an arsonist.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.121
David...

31:38.164 --> 31:42.501
I'm no doctor, but I don't think
this guy died in his sleep.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.641
Ballistics matched
the bullets in Salazar's head

31:49.675 --> 31:51.643
to the ones used
to kill the parking valet.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.512
All right, so then how are we
doing on the money trail?

31:53.545 --> 31:55.381
Salazar's murder
gave us the wedge we needed

31:55.414 --> 31:56.515
with the offshore bank.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.650
They handed over the transfer
records this morning.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.586
We handed them over
to Charlie this afternoon.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.021
I mean, so that's
the thing.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.222
Why kill your bank contact

32:03.255 --> 32:05.324
if you're just going to steal
more credit cards, right?

32:05.357 --> 32:07.426
AMITA:
The stolen credit cards charge

32:07.459 --> 32:10.062
large transactions
through dummy online stores,

32:10.096 --> 32:11.197
who sends the money

32:11.230 --> 32:12.698
to an offshore
bank in Nauru.

32:12.731 --> 32:16.468
Right, and then we figure
Don's postulate,

32:16.502 --> 32:18.004
that the money then headed to
Mexico.

32:18.037 --> 32:18.404
Okay.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.972
Okay.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.607
Charlie,
there's just too much.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.808
I mean, we can data-stream mine
all day long

32:22.841 --> 32:25.511
and still not find a discernible
pattern in all this muck.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.346
No, I think it-it-it's...

32:27.379 --> 32:28.680
No, we need something else.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.083
We know how much
and where it's going.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.151
And the offshore bank

32:32.184 --> 32:35.354
sends the money into Mexico
City, but you know,

32:35.387 --> 32:37.423
we're looking for a few
hundred thousand dollars

32:37.456 --> 32:40.592
out of $40 billion
of identical transfers.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.760
Ah, you're right.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.995
We need something else.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.196
I talked to Millie

32:44.230 --> 32:46.665
and she's set on taking
MacMillan's money.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.101
And you're set against it.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.402
Yeah, well, someone has to be.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.203
I don't know.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.405
I mean, literally,
I do not know.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.041
You both make
such compelling points.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.475
That's the paradox.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.709
It just seems
like everyone's right.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.679
I mean, I just-- still I think
I need to go to that meeting

33:00.712 --> 33:03.449
with my eyes
and my mind wide open.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.085
And what if you don't like
what they have to say?

33:06.118 --> 33:08.154
Well, then Millie's
out of luck.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.256
Fair enough.

33:10.289 --> 33:14.360
Since when did you
become my conscience?

33:14.393 --> 33:17.363
Around the same time
we started making out.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.502
ALAN:
Hey, hi, Millie.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.671
I-I was going to cook
for you, you know,

33:25.704 --> 33:27.539
'cause you always cook--
you're such a good cook--

33:27.573 --> 33:29.541
and then I realized
I don't cook.

33:29.575 --> 33:30.609
Ah.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.811
Well, I have been known
to eat an occasional pi--

33:32.844 --> 33:35.447
uh, uh, pi-pizza
once in a while.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.515
Thank you.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.150
No, no, I mean,
thanks for the food.

33:38.184 --> 33:39.585
No, well, thank
you for the haven.

33:39.618 --> 33:40.586
(chuckles)
Yeah, well,

33:40.619 --> 33:42.821
um...

33:42.854 --> 33:45.591
You know, I really thought
that I was ready for this,

33:45.624 --> 33:48.160
but the politics
are killing me.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.761
Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.698
I mean-- and no offense, but
the geniuses are exhausting.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.167
(chuckles)

33:55.201 --> 33:56.468
Go ahead,
tell me about it.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.570
But of, of course I had,
um, a lot of help...

33:58.604 --> 33:59.771
DON:
Hey, Dad.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.140
Hey, where's Charlie?

34:01.173 --> 34:02.141
Oh.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.743
Hi, Millie.
It's all right.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.846
Uh, we w-- we were just, uh,
going to have a, uh, a, um...

34:07.879 --> 34:08.847
MILLIE:
Pizza.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.449
Hey, what's happening, man?

34:10.482 --> 34:11.750
So, listen.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.185
Oh, hey, Millie, good.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.453
You know what?
I left you a message.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.588
- I know; I got it, Charlie. -
Listen, I have some concerns.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.490
Can I talk to you one second?

34:18.524 --> 34:19.191
I have some concerns.

34:19.225 --> 34:19.758
I know; it's just one second.

34:19.791 --> 34:20.126
I have serious concerns.

34:20.159 --> 34:20.959
(mumbles)

34:20.992 --> 34:23.562
I don't think
she's here for you.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.297
Oh. Right? And it, and it--

34:25.331 --> 34:27.566
the thing is broken and I
don't even know how to fix it

34:27.599 --> 34:29.335
and you're the only one
probably, so, uh...

34:29.368 --> 34:31.270
- Oh.
- Thanks.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.704
DON:
We'll just be outside.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.410
Ah... you know what,
it's poetic justice

34:38.444 --> 34:40.479
'cause he walks in on me
and Amita all the time.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.348
Right, look, we just got
to cut him some slack,

34:42.381 --> 34:43.349
I think, you know?

34:43.382 --> 34:44.416
Cut him some slack?

34:44.450 --> 34:46.418
Man, he's dating my
boss, all right?

34:46.452 --> 34:47.819
So I'm allowed to
have my issues.

34:47.853 --> 34:48.820
Ah, I understand.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.656
Hey, look, you can take
my shrink appointment.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.358
- Shrink appointment?
- Yeah.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.360
They're making me see
a therapist.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.494
Are they really?

34:55.527 --> 34:56.728
This post-shooting thing.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.497
Which shooting?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.666
(sighs) I mean,
there, there have been a few.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.668
Don't tell me
you haven't noticed.

35:02.701 --> 35:03.869
What do you mean?
Of course I've noticed.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.304
I mean...

35:09.241 --> 35:11.343
Anywho.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.445
So what's going on
with that money trail?

35:13.479 --> 35:13.945
It's not a trail,

35:13.979 --> 35:14.580
it's a damn river.

35:18.284 --> 35:19.518
Upstream.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.887
- Swimming upstream.
- What?

35:21.920 --> 35:24.390
Wait a minute.
W-What are you talking about?

35:24.423 --> 35:25.224
I gotta go find Amita.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.629
CHARLIE:
Now, even after the bank

35:30.662 --> 35:34.200
in Nauru gave us access
to their accounts,

35:34.233 --> 35:35.801
we still lost track of the money

35:35.834 --> 35:36.868
in the massive transfer
to Mexico.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.538
Most of the money stayed
in Mexico.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.806
In a death squad
retirement plan, I guess.

35:40.839 --> 35:41.773
But some of it had

35:41.807 --> 35:43.575
to return to Los Angeles
to keep the robbers

35:43.609 --> 35:44.443
in business.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.878
Okay, so they're living
off the land?

35:46.912 --> 35:48.314
Well, death squads
can't be cheap,

35:48.347 --> 35:49.315
so to find the returning money,

35:49.348 --> 35:50.716
it was a matter
of using an optimization model,

35:50.749 --> 35:53.252
something called
Outlier Detection.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.920
- Oh boy.
- No, no, it's not a big deal

35:54.953 --> 35:57.189
because Charlie
helped develop it

35:57.223 --> 35:58.089
for the Treasury Department's

35:58.123 --> 35:59.658
Terrorist Financial
Tracking Program.

35:59.691 --> 36:00.526
Right, you see,
at first

36:00.559 --> 36:02.728
we were doing
a "brute force" search

36:02.761 --> 36:05.731
in which you cast a net
over a river of information

36:05.764 --> 36:06.798
and you try
to catch everything.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.469
Outlier Detection, however,
is target specific.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.472
It's like fly fishing
in the data stream,

36:13.505 --> 36:14.706
choosing a spot
by spawning behavior,

36:14.740 --> 36:16.542
selecting the right bait,

36:16.575 --> 36:17.609
a method in which we were able

36:17.643 --> 36:18.777
to cast our rod
in the spot we wanted

36:18.810 --> 36:22.314
and catch the exact type
of fish we needed.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.849
Now, knowing
the exact variables--

36:23.882 --> 36:25.651
how much stolen
money existed,

36:25.684 --> 36:28.687
the robbery dates, where
the transfer originated from--

36:28.720 --> 36:32.224
we were able to zero in
on seven wire transfers

36:32.258 --> 36:35.694
from Nauru to an
East L.A. wire office.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.496
AMITA: Well, the transfers
weren't exact matches

36:37.529 --> 36:38.430
for the numbers

36:38.464 --> 36:39.097
or times, but they fit
a general pattern.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.732
To pick up
a wire transfer,

36:40.766 --> 36:42.701
you need a driver's
license, right?

36:42.734 --> 36:43.969
Isn't this...

36:44.002 --> 36:48.440
the same woman that David tried
to interrogate?

36:48.474 --> 36:50.809
Yeah, it is.
Her name is Maria Campos.

37:01.453 --> 37:04.323
AFI report from Mexico.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.625
Maria Campos is married
to one Hector Campos.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.759
Ex-Fuerzas Especiales,

37:07.793 --> 37:09.828
did a training program
at Fort Ord

37:09.861 --> 37:10.696
in '93.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.830
Supports the ex-military angle,
right?

37:11.863 --> 37:14.800
Yeah, he specialized in
commanding two-team black ops.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.335
It's a family business.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.804
He runs one team, lets
his wife run the other.

37:18.837 --> 37:19.438
It's got to be him.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.640
Trying to kill three kids.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.276
I mean, the border patrol
has him coming up

37:24.310 --> 37:25.611
a couple of months
ago... one way.

37:25.644 --> 37:26.778
Mexican authorities

37:26.812 --> 37:28.680
haven't seen him,
no sign of a return,

37:28.714 --> 37:30.882
and Maria Campos gave
the wire transfer office

37:30.916 --> 37:32.318
an address in East L.A.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.652
Colby and David are
on their way over.

37:33.685 --> 37:34.653
Excellent.

37:34.686 --> 37:35.754
All right.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.033
Go, go, go!

37:48.066 --> 37:51.570
On the floor! Federal agents!
Search warrant!

37:53.104 --> 37:55.006
Clear.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.378
Smells like
gun cleaner.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.547
- Yeah, it's strong, too.
- All clear, sir.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.883
(on radio): Team inside,
no suspects in sight.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.019
5.7 rounds.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.321
Well, that team
we took down,

38:09.355 --> 38:10.422
- they had a P90, right?
- Uh-huh,

38:10.456 --> 38:12.057
but they only had one.
We got about 300, 400 rounds

38:12.090 --> 38:13.859
missing out of
these boxes.

38:13.892 --> 38:14.893
These guys are

38:14.926 --> 38:16.695
all armed up now.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.096
All right, take a look at this.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.666
They got the restaurants
they hit marked in this book

38:20.699 --> 38:21.867
with about
half a dozen others.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.743
Oh, have a look at that.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.678
You recognize that?

38:35.013 --> 38:36.482
Is that Infante's school?

38:36.515 --> 38:38.083
Yeah.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.918
These guys have killed
entire villages.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.719
Remember that?

39:15.521 --> 39:15.921
(tires screeching)

39:17.889 --> 39:20.859
(siren wailing)

39:20.892 --> 39:22.060
Run! Run!

39:22.093 --> 39:23.061
Run! Go! Go!

39:23.094 --> 39:24.062
Don't move!

39:25.597 --> 39:26.632
Down!

39:28.834 --> 39:30.402
Run! Go! Go!

39:30.436 --> 39:31.837
(children screaming)

39:47.085 --> 39:48.487
(girl sobbing)

39:50.922 --> 39:53.158
Call the paramedics!

39:54.460 --> 39:56.194
DAVID:
It's okay.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.696
It's okay.
Come here.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.867
DISPATCH: Copy your request for
medical unit.

40:01.900 --> 40:02.734
Rescue ambulance is rolling.

40:02.768 --> 40:05.003
ETA for your location--
five minutes.

40:10.909 --> 40:11.743
MAN:
Professor Eppes.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.679
- Hello.
- A true pleasure to meet you.

40:13.712 --> 40:14.680
Pleasure to meet you.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.547
MacMillan Pharmaceuticals could
not be happier

40:15.581 --> 40:16.715
- to have you involved.
- Oh, well...

40:16.748 --> 40:19.818
Uh, Mr. Meisner and I were
just finalizing the funding

40:19.851 --> 40:21.687
and clinical trial schedule.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.854
In all honesty,
Professor,

40:22.888 --> 40:24.923
I could not see this project
going forward without you.

40:24.956 --> 40:27.526
Mm-hmm, which is why
Cal Sci will administer

40:27.559 --> 40:30.228
the trials and monitor the
drug every step of the way.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.630
Well, not all.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.798
MacMillan will do

40:32.831 --> 40:33.965
its own in-house trials.

40:33.999 --> 40:34.966
No, uh-uh.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.234
Everything goes through Cal Sci.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.570
In fact, all the
computational analysis

40:38.604 --> 40:39.971
will be carried out

40:40.005 --> 40:42.941
by Professor Eppes
and his staff.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.910
Sorry, that's just
the way we roll here.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.178
(chuckling): I'll have to run
that by my people.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.014
Oh, no, of course;
yeah, run that by...

40:49.047 --> 40:51.617
Oh, and while you're running
stuff by, run by them

40:51.650 --> 40:54.019
that five percent
of the gross of the profits

40:54.052 --> 40:55.654
will go towards a group

40:55.687 --> 40:56.988
of Third World
AIDS organizations

40:57.022 --> 40:58.256
that Professors Eppes
and Ramanajun

40:58.289 --> 41:01.026
will be putting
together for you.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.028
Uh, five percent?

41:03.061 --> 41:04.162
Gross, not net.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.131
We barely have
a profit margin

41:06.164 --> 41:08.066
- as it is.
- (chuckling): Mr. Meisner,

41:08.099 --> 41:10.602
a pharmaceutical company
with no profit margin?

41:10.636 --> 41:12.037
Come on.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.807
I can't agree to that.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.042
Sure you can.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.510
You can if you want
the participation

41:18.544 --> 41:19.811
of Professor Eppes.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.046
Isn't that right,
Professor?

41:21.079 --> 41:23.114
That's right.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.983
(sighs)

41:25.016 --> 41:26.151
Oh, relax,
Mr. Meisner.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.720
95% of one of the world's
greatest mathematical minds

41:28.754 --> 41:31.823
is worth
a whole lot more

41:31.857 --> 41:33.992
than 100% of nothing.

41:36.728 --> 41:37.929
I'll call you.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.064
Pleasure. Thank you, sir.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.871
(sighs)

41:45.904 --> 41:48.239
What just happened here?

41:48.273 --> 41:50.208
Well, you made my life
a little more difficult

41:50.241 --> 41:52.611
and a lot more interesting.

41:52.644 --> 41:56.247
Well, I pretty much can say
the same thing about you.

41:56.281 --> 41:57.549
Yeah?

42:01.887 --> 42:04.055
Hey.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.657
Agent Eppes.

42:05.691 --> 42:09.327
* ...if I shall be released...

42:09.360 --> 42:12.130
You got any, uh, time,
by any chance?

42:12.163 --> 42:15.133
Uh, well, if you don't mind
hanging out for a while,

42:15.166 --> 42:17.135
I'll shake loose ten
minutes and sign you off.

42:17.168 --> 42:18.203
No, well, I mean,

42:18.236 --> 42:21.607
I was kind of hoping
for a little more than that.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.612
I'm pretty booked today.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.015
I mean, just a half hour
would be great.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.883
You know, I'll hang out
or whatever you want.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.885
(phone ringing)

42:33.919 --> 42:35.253
You gotta take that?

42:35.286 --> 42:36.187
Uh...

42:38.824 --> 42:41.059
Nah.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.162
Okay.

42:44.195 --> 42:47.966
* I will do...

42:47.999 --> 42:49.701
Thanks.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.971
* Whatever it takes to believe

42:54.305 --> 42:56.908
* A new day will come

42:59.745 --> 43:01.279
* A new day will come

43:04.850 --> 43:06.685
* New day.
