(Man hums tune)

00:36.913 --> 00:39.871
(Finishes humming)

00:42.084 --> 00:43.620
Aloha!

00:43.753 --> 00:45.709
Cray.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.630
I didn't know you were here. Coffee?

00:49.759 --> 00:53.377
Had some on the plane.
I love the new place.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.594
I wasn't sure you would.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.338
You look great.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.716
Did you out your hair?

00:59.852 --> 01:01.843
You took down my Les Blank poster.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.015
We've been meaning
to come and see you,

01:04.148 --> 01:06.480
but Sofia's been so busy
with her new school.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.315
Believe me, | get it.

01:08.444 --> 01:11.060
You haven't told her
about the thingamahoogie.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.653
I thought I'd wait...

01:12.782 --> 01:14.238
for the right moment.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.074
Hawaii must be beautiful.

01:17.203 --> 01:20.491
Hawaii? I haven't been in Hawaii.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.739
- Oh, I thought...
— Didn't you get my letter?

01:22.875 --> 01:24.331
Daddy?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.413
(Cray) Oh. Mm.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.584
- I missed you so much.
— I missed you too, sweet pea.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.456
- Mama.
— Look at you.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.835
— Like it?
— Oh, it's beautiful.

01:35.972 --> 01:37.382
You made it?

01:37.515 --> 01:39.551
Hey, let's go.
Catch Pete if we hustle.

01:39.684 --> 01:41.766
— Where are we going?
- (Laughs)

01:41.894 --> 01:42.974
Silly.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.641
(I Go To The Mardi Gras)

01:45.773 --> 01:47.434
I don't even have a costume.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.893
Fantastic.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.775
— Our national anthem.
— (Cray inhales deeply)

01:55.908 --> 01:57.148
Satin Doll.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.617
That would have been my second choice.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.281
Let's go!

02:02.665 --> 02:04.656
(lmitating a monkey)

02:05.710 --> 02:07.701
Whoo!

04:01.033 --> 04:03.024
l'm—a finish what I started,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.617
but I am done with all that.

04:06.789 --> 04:08.450
Done and done.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.413
You ready?

04:11.377 --> 04:13.368
Let me grab my keys.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.499
Done with all what, Daddy?

04:17.842 --> 04:19.002
You already know.

04:19.135 --> 04:22.002
You ain't missed a Mardi Gras day
since you could walk.

04:22.138 --> 04:23.253
I did last year.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.471
Jail doesn't count.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.339
Taught me something.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.138
Just another Tuesday
I can live without.

04:30.271 --> 04:34.264
— (Davina) See, I don't believe that, Daddy.
— Well, you do.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.686
You and your brother
and your sister -

04:36.819 --> 04:38.730
ya'll do fine without.

04:38.863 --> 04:40.728
We aren't a big chief.

04:40.865 --> 04:42.947
Neither am |. Not no more.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.782
l'm retired as soon as I finish this here.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.197
Look at you saying all that
while you sew.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.787
Your brother's gonna miss his plane.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.953
— What are you gonna do with the suit?
- I'm gonna give it to Ronnie.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.044
He broke down his last year
so we could come out pretty for St Joe's.

04:57.173 --> 05:00.961
— (Delmond) George said Ronnie was sewing.
— Well, I'll give it to you then.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.799
I know you ain't sewing.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.010
- I'm sewing.
— (Albert laughs)

05:06.056 --> 05:07.637
You going out this year, Del?

05:07.766 --> 05:10.633
- If he does.
— Don't play with me, boy.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.681
| see right through that.
l invented that shit.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.055
(Davina chuckles)

05:20.404 --> 05:21.769
It's a ticket.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.988
Houston to New York.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.947
| see it's a ticket.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.612
I'm wondering why.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.827
Come up for a couple days,
help me finish.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.617
You're almost done.
I'm sure you need a couple things too.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.331
I don't need nothing.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.247
All right, you don't need nothing.
I could use your help.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.791
You go up day after tomorrow,
you'll be back Monday.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.539
Well, take care.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.633
Well, he didn't exactly say no.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.848
He ain't give the ticket back either.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.181
- I'll work on him.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.934
(Latin music playing on radio)

06:06.242 --> 06:08.233
(Turns up volume)

06:18.587 --> 06:21.044
(Distant siren wailing)

06:28.389 --> 06:30.380
(Turns off music)

(Siren continues)

06:48.826 --> 06:50.532
(Sighs)

06:51.704 --> 06:53.945
The glory that was Rome.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.917
Come on, man. Sousaphone line,
look at where you're standing.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.627
People, we're not gonna be doing
any Mardi Gras parades this season

07:02.756 --> 07:04.371
if we can't do any better than this.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.045
We cannot be "as good as".
You must be "better than".

07:07.177 --> 07:10.590
— Dr Frasor, can I get with you a minute?
- There's gonna be a lot of people out...

07:10.723 --> 07:13.260
My cousin called me.
She has a boy at John Mac, ninth grade.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.348
— Desiree, let me stop you right there.
- (Whistle)

07:15.477 --> 07:18.184
She's about to lose her mind
'cause of what's going on in that school.

07:18.314 --> 07:21.852
I know John Mac had security problems
last fall, but I heard things had gotten better.

07:21.984 --> 07:25.021
He's scared to go to school in the morning
and my cousin is scared to send him.

07:25.154 --> 07:27.361
We are over capacity right now.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.320
If they don't get him
into a better situation,

07:29.450 --> 07:31.441
my cousin's gonna have to pack up
and go to Houston.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.317
That might be the best thing, you know.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.161
I hate to say that,
but I just can't make an exception.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.826
(Playing loudly)

07:37.958 --> 07:40.415
I'm sorry, Desiree. I'm sorry.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.587
(J‘ Reach Out, I'll Be There)

07:52.473 --> 07:54.259
Are we even doing Mardi Gras?

07:54.391 --> 07:55.847
Man, please.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.343
Not everybody got instruments.
And we ain't got uniforms either.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.220
Max Band wore windbreakers last year.

08:01.357 --> 08:04.224
We could do that — those of us
who have instruments.

08:04.360 --> 08:09.480
It's not even about that. Even if we had
instruments or uniforms, we're not ready,

08:09.615 --> 08:11.025
not this year.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.570
Shit, I was born ready.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.078
Hey, watch your language, son.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.240
Why are we coming to band class
if we ain't a band?

08:17.373 --> 08:19.910
We're a band,
just not ready for Mardi Gras this year.

08:20.042 --> 08:23.125
But if you work hard,
maybe next year.

08:23.253 --> 08:27.622
Y'all come to class to learn music, right?
A part of learning to play is listening to players.

08:27.758 --> 08:30.124
(Lecoeur) Go ahead and play it, Mr. Batiste.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.923
(J‘ West End Blues)

08:47.236 --> 08:51.104
Whoo! See, now that isjazz music
being invented right there.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.572
Man, I could play them notes.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.659
Maybe not like he plays them,
but you write that down on paper,

08:56.787 --> 08:59.904
let me take it home,
I'll come back and play all those notes.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.746
Oh yeah? But would you?

09:01.875 --> 09:05.333
I mean, would you play them if they weren't
written down right in front of you,

09:05.462 --> 09:08.420
if you couldn't take it home
and practice all night long?

09:09.717 --> 09:13.801
The man is playing his heart right there.
He's not reading notes off a piece of paper.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.841
He's writing them as he plays, with a feel,

09:16.974 --> 09:20.011
in the moment.

09:20.144 --> 09:23.307
Now that's jazz.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.179
That's improvisation.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.055
That's genius.

09:27.192 --> 09:31.481
And we invented that in New Orleans,
right here.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.651
Close your eyes.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.490
Listen.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.454
(Hums along)

09:57.723 --> 10:00.465
(Sofia) Suddenly everything makes sense...

10:02.060 --> 10:04.972
the looks, the whispers.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.845
We thought you knew, Sof.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.563
We felt bad for you.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.978
Did everybody know?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.942
Pretty much.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.062
Jesus.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.315
l was so stupid.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.696
You never said anything.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.741
I figured if you wanted
to talk about it, you would.

10:23.874 --> 10:27.458
It's not exactly something
you just bring up, you know?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.793
I guess not.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.162
(Honks horn)

10:31.298 --> 10:35.541
Ode to joy.
There she is — Mama Liar.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.837
See you, Jocelyn.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.961
Bye, Sof.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.935
(J‘ Annie strums guitar, hums along)

10:52.486 --> 10:54.727
You know, this would be
so much easier on the violin.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.033
My other song was so good.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.949
If only little Bobby Z
hadn't gotten there first.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.448
You know what?
Fuck it. I give up.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.575
I'm just a player.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.042
And that's OK.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.786
You haven't even hardly tried yet.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.960
You gotta keep at it until you bleed.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.253
l'm bleeding.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.128
— (Laughs) You ain't bleeding, not yet.
- I'm bleeding.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.969
Hey, It's Alright, Ma (l'm Only Bleeding).
How about that for a title?

11:24.101 --> 11:26.217
I'll give it to you for free.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.863
(J‘ Rhythm & Blues)

12:13.984 --> 12:16.942
Oh! Henry Butler,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.356
- (Cheering)
— Henry Butler.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.945
Glad to see you home, Henry.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.780
Oh, it's good to be home.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.446
Right here. Right here.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.785
(Henry) Good to be home.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.662
What you mean, politics?

12:32.794 --> 12:34.455
I mean, we write the world we know.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.920
We get out there
in the middle of the argument.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.334
Which argument now?

12:38.467 --> 12:40.503
The one about the city.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.672
Where we've been,
where we are now,

12:42.804 --> 12:45.716
where we're going
if we don't stop and think.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.556
Man, Davis, I rhyme what I know.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.550
Exactly. That's always the way.

12:50.687 --> 12:54.851
And I know the Calliope and coming up
in New Orleans, but that's all I got.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.360
Oh. Hold on.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.529
Where'd y'all get the po' boys?

13:02.658 --> 13:04.614
Captain Sal's.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.405
Oh, Captain Sal's? The truth?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.954
You ever listen to Public Enemy?

13:11.083 --> 13:13.825
I heard 'em, yeah. My uncle used to be
into that ol' Def Jam shit.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.792
Go back through this stuff, brah.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.832
It's the great untraveled road of hip—hop —

13:17.965 --> 13:20.251
political rage,
righteous empowerment,

13:20.384 --> 13:23.467
standing tall amid a wasteland
of gangsta posing.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.881
Then The Clash...

13:26.014 --> 13:28.596
London Calling, Sandinista!

13:29.851 --> 13:32.558
They're a thrash band or something.
I don't dig metal, man.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.394
No, not for the songwriting.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.559
Strummer was kind of a flawed vehicle.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.900
But for the stance, man, the attitude!

13:41.989 --> 13:44.105
The mother lode.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.900
Woody Guthrie.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.574
Don't let the first couple verses
of This Land Is Your Land fool you.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.948
That is one really angry
white boy right there.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.959
Beginning of a journey, brah.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.714
— Where's y'all bathroom?
- Straight back.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.304
Are you serious?

14:13.437 --> 14:17.271
Darling...
New Orleans has enough dance music.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.606
Times being what they are
in this sad, fractured town,

14:19.735 --> 14:21.566
it's the hour to fight the power.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.730
With this kid?

14:22.863 --> 14:26.026
And Woody Guthrie's
Smithsonian recordings?

14:26.158 --> 14:28.945
Phil Ochs said that what
America desperately needed

14:29.077 --> 14:31.864
was a pop star
with the looks of Elvis Presley

14:31.997 --> 14:33.703
and the soul of Che Guevara.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.572
You think he's the one?

14:36.418 --> 14:37.624
I know it.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.493
(Toilet flushes)

14:40.756 --> 14:42.371
Who's Phil Ochs?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.208
— See you, man.
— See you, man.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.220
— There you go.
— Thank you, man.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.601
— When's Cornell coming back?
- Oh, he didn't tell you?

14:53.727 --> 14:55.683
- No.
— He didn't tell me neither.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.303
— Oh man.
— Great to see you, Henry.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.476
All right, Porter.
See you on Friday, man.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.440
— All right.
— All right.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.527
- What's Friday?
— We got this gig at the Howlin' Wolf. You free?

15:05.655 --> 15:08.943
(Sighs) No, man, we got a gig on Friday.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.941
Oh, man, that's too bad.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.443
We could sure use a 'bone.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.991
What about Delfeayo or Shorty?

15:15.123 --> 15:18.741
— (Laughs) Those cats are in demand, man.
— Yeah, true that. True that.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.334
Hey, man, that was fun.
It was a real honor.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.419
Thank you, man. My pleasure.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.004
Listen, Antoine, I'm out.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.839
I didn't forget.

15:29.221 --> 15:30.210
What the fuck?

15:30.347 --> 15:32.508
l docked you half. You were late.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.757
— Ten minutes.
— Man, half an hour.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.430
Next time I'll dock the whole thing
and you're done.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.890
- Shit.
— (Laughing)

15:43.026 --> 15:45.517
Man, gotta pay the cost
to be the boss, right?

15:45.654 --> 15:49.693
I hear you. You know, I'm going on tour
this summer with a horn section.

15:49.825 --> 15:50.905
No kidding?

15:51.034 --> 15:54.276
Yeah, we're doing East Coast dates,
Europe, Japan.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.540
Japan? Man, I've been to Europe,
but Japan Japan?

15:57.666 --> 15:59.622
Man, I'd love to get me some of that.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.787
Well, Friday's kind of a dress rehearsal.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.457
— Uh—huh.
— I'd take Troy, but he's so unavailable.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.422
— You know what I'm saying?
— (Chuckles) Right.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.088
I know what you're saying.
I know what you're saying.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.211
(Police radio chatter)

16:19.813 --> 16:22.350
John, what brings you here?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.814
I thought you might want
to see my new asshole.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.308
Terry, what the fuck?

16:26.444 --> 16:28.184
I tried to talk to you.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.528
— We were working a legit lead.
- The husband?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.568
— Come on.
— We had to clear him first, didn't we?

16:32.701 --> 16:36.068
Did anybody talk to the detective
working the attempted push—in down the block?

16:36.204 --> 16:37.865
- We sent a team over.
— A week and a half later.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.239
— What did you expect to find?
- You're not Fifth District.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.117
— You're not Homicide. You go to a chief?
— Is this about turf, John?

16:43.253 --> 16:47.667
The city's on its knees. Do yourjob
and I wouldn't have to fucking do it for you.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.670
You're gonna get a reputation, Terry.

16:56.892 --> 17:01.226
I'm going to run, pick up the boys at school,
take them to the doctor.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.606
LaDonna, I found an apartment.

17:06.193 --> 17:10.106
Mama, I wish you wouldn't.
Larry likes having you here. So do |.

17:10.238 --> 17:14.572
- And the boys adore it.
— It's on the bus line, 20 minutes each way.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.657
I'll be here whenever anybody wants me.

17:18.914 --> 17:20.779
I'm putting the house up for sale too.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.872
It's time. And I need the money.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.617
I didn't move up here
to be a burden on y'all.

17:25.754 --> 17:26.960
Fine.

17:27.088 --> 17:31.422
I suppose you agree with Larry now, huh,
about selling the bar?

17:31.551 --> 17:35.419
I know that y'all are gonna have to decide
sooner or later which it's going to be.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.756
l'm—a pick up my boys.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.438
(J‘ Dixieland jazz)

18:34.447 --> 18:37.109
(Chuckles) That's such a cool piece, Tom.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.779
Thanks. Yeah, I wrote it for Henry Butler.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.197
I heard Henry playing
Tipitina on the radio

18:42.330 --> 18:44.742
and I took a little fragment
of what he was playing

18:44.874 --> 18:47.741
and put the two—three clave
underneath it and...

18:47.877 --> 18:49.128
J‘ Ta—ta bop bop bom J‘

18:49.254 --> 18:52.667
..took that idea and just stretched it
into a whole tune.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.336
I kind of did that with a Dylan song...

18:56.803 --> 18:59.545
except I didn't mean to.

18:59.681 --> 19:02.468
—(Laughs)
— Yeah, well, you know, at least you can sing.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.726
I never learned how to sing.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.888
— Oh, but you can write.
— Yeah, but you can sing.

19:06.021 --> 19:09.104
Come on, let's do Heliotrope.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.163
And with this sacred stick,

19:28.293 --> 19:31.456
we consecrate the bonds
of musicianhood.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.290
Let he who has partook know

19:36.426 --> 19:39.088
that he is on the savage
and unyielding quest

19:39.220 --> 19:42.633
toward the very frontiers
of funk and righteousness.

19:42.766 --> 19:45.724
McAlary, what the fuck
are we gonna be playing?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.093
Bounce funk rap
with a brass band twist.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.312
Shh.
Our message will be angry and political.

19:51.441 --> 19:55.775
We will speak to the injustices and affronts
of our time and we shall not be moved.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.610
But do we have gigs?

19:57.739 --> 20:00.355
Uh, three or four clubs a week,
once I get a demo to people.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.859
We don't even got songs yet.
What the hell are you talking about, recording?

20:03.995 --> 20:05.860
I've been holed up for months writing.

20:05.997 --> 20:09.615
And the material is solid, T,
like a rock, brah.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.582
But who's gonna be the frontman?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.872
— Uh, lwill front some...
- Oh, hell no.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.963
But... But... Fuck you.

20:17.092 --> 20:21.210
Most of the front work rests right here —
Lil Calliope.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.962
— Young 'un can sing?
- No, man, I rhyme.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.090
That he can. Check this out.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.218
(Rap music playing)

20:44.619 --> 20:47.201
Well, shit, let's see what the hell comes.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.413
McAlary...
are you paying for rehearsal space?

20:55.797 --> 20:57.503
What?

20:57.632 --> 20:59.714
(Ripert) New order —
a fluke and two pounded tuna.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.835
Take a picture of that.
I'll take a wallet-size.

21:02.971 --> 21:06.259
How's that pounded tuna any different
from the 32 others you sent tonight?

21:06.391 --> 21:08.097
I don't know. I just like this one.

21:08.226 --> 21:11.059
I think I finally, I don't know,
hit my groove with this one.

21:11.187 --> 21:14.645
— Just another tuna dish to me.
— (Clicks tongue) I'm just saying.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.639
— It's a good—looking dish.
— Yeah.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.483
- Fire two turf, one well.
— Two turf, one well. Yes, chef.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.399
Coming up — two halibut,
two skate, two turf...

21:22.532 --> 21:24.864
(J‘ Gentle ragtime jazz)

21:29.831 --> 21:31.037
Hey.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.202
I'll have what he's having.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.877
You know much about ragtime?

21:38.006 --> 21:39.041
No.

21:39.174 --> 21:44.840
Scott Joplin, its greatest practitioner,
said it must not be played too fast.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.086
OK.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.847
So how are they?

21:49.976 --> 21:54.140
A little brisk. The Latin tinge
is a nice touch, though.

21:54.272 --> 21:58.561
Evan Christopher, the clarinet player,
reminds me of Tony Parenti.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.191
So North White Street.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.356
Yes.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.445
That big shipwreck.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.485
A fixer—upper.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.238
At the planning meeting on Friday

22:09.370 --> 22:12.658
a friendly fellow came up to me
and congratulated me on my successful bid.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.082
That was friendly.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.917
But the auction hasn't happened yet.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.788
I think you're making a wise purchase.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.210
Assuming you win the auction, of course.

22:24.677 --> 22:28.670
l, uh, wouldn't pay more than
a million-one for it.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.091
But that's just me.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.599
_ (People chattering)
_ (Horns honking)

22:45.865 --> 22:48.732
- That is so good.
— Roast pork. We were lucky to get it.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.951
— They're usually out by this hour.
— This swine is mine.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.162
- Salt and pepper squid?
— No, thanks. No, thanks.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.746
— Just a little?
- No.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.740
Suit yourself. It's delicious.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.959
You're lucky I didn't
order the tripe medley.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.249
Wait, I did order the tripe medley.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.090
Damn, girl, where do you put it all?

23:06.219 --> 23:09.211
You eat like you just got out ofjail.
They don't feed you where you work?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.679
Oh, we don't eat food. We just cook it.
There's no time.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.766
And if there is time,
you're looking at it all day, you don't want it.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.600
Until about an hour after work.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.436
And then you'd eat the box
a Big Mac comes in.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.978
A hard thing you picked to do with your life.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.395
You and me both, right?

23:23.945 --> 23:25.230
People like us...

23:25.363 --> 23:27.228
wejust do a thing.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.356
We don't have a choice, really.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.278
Could you do anything else?

23:32.287 --> 23:33.652
Probably not.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.244
Your parents cool with it?

23:36.416 --> 23:39.499
It's not exactly what they wanted for me,
put it that way.

23:40.378 --> 23:43.541
- I hear that.
— Oh, your father must be proud.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.377
It's hard to tell sometimes.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.671
Actually, he's coming to town tomorrow.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.511
All right, let me try a bite of this damn tripe.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.351
(Laughs) Come on.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.222
It's not that bad. It's good!

24:03.359 --> 24:06.066
(Man) You should freeze some
and give it to your mother and family.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.151
(Man 2) You know how much
she loves your gumbo.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.067
— (Man) Oh, look who it is.
— (Bird chirping)

24:10.199 --> 24:11.188
(Knocking)

24:12.619 --> 24:13.950
Hello.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.330
Gentlemen, compliments
of your next—door neighbor.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.573
Well, Davis "McEllery,"
as | live and breathe.

24:19.709 --> 24:23.452
You're...gonna get my name right someday.
Don't worry about it.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.920
2000. That's good, a good year.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.880
Yes, especially for, uh, Bordeaux.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.421
Sit, sit. I'll get some glasses
and we'll open it now.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.168
No, actually...

24:33.890 --> 24:36.597
I think you're gonna want
that bottle for later.

24:38.853 --> 24:43.142
l have, uh, some musicians
coming over tomorrow, rehearsing.

24:43.274 --> 24:47.142
Musicians? What kind of music?

24:47.278 --> 24:49.985
Brass funk hip—hop
with a bounce twist.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.729
— Oh God.
— Heavy on the bass,

24:51.866 --> 24:53.231
which is to say sousaphone.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.484
— Tomorrow, you say?
- Yeah.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.612
And then for twice a week thereafter
until further notice.

24:58.748 --> 25:01.865
Guys, forgive me my trespasses.

25:03.628 --> 25:06.870
It's only until we get
a couple sets together, OK?

25:07.006 --> 25:10.089
And then we can move it into the clubs!

25:10.218 --> 25:12.675
(Donald) Now's when you call the cops.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.886
Davina said she was gonna
get you a winter coat.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.926
She did — a shiny, puffy thing.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.097
Made me look like the Michelin Man.

25:21.229 --> 25:24.187
(Distant sirens wailing,
horns honking)

25:24.315 --> 25:25.896
You got another room?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.517
A secret passageway or something, hm?

25:29.654 --> 25:31.360
This is it. You take the bed.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.696
I'm gonna stay over by Jill's while you're here.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.157
See, now I know you ain't sewing.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.992
Nary a bead, a thread
or a feather to be seen.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.578
And there ain't no place to work.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.039
l'm set up over at Jill's.
She got a lot more space.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.829
Come on, let's make the bead shop.
I still got a few things to pick up.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.498
— Let me hit the head.
- All right.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.916
That's another reason
why I gotta stop masking.

25:50.049 --> 25:54.042
It takes a young man's bladder
to walk around all day in an Indian suit!

25:56.139 --> 25:59.006
Lord in heaven,
you call this a bathtub?

26:00.560 --> 26:03.302
Next, this is the whole of Lot 23,

26:03.438 --> 26:05.554
commercial building on the property,

26:05.690 --> 26:09.308
at 426 North White Street,
Second Municipal District.

26:09.444 --> 26:12.732
The writ amount is $500,000.

26:12.864 --> 26:14.570
$500,000.

26:14.699 --> 26:19.113
There are taxes due to the city — $1215.23.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.861
I need an opening bid of $500,000.

26:21.998 --> 26:26.367
Starting bidding now on property
426 North White Street at $500,000.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.878
I have $500,000.

26:28.004 --> 26:30.996
Do l have six?
Do l have $600,000?

26:31.132 --> 26:33.839
I have $600,000.
Do l have seven?

26:33.968 --> 26:36.710
$700,000.
Do l have $800,000?

26:38.473 --> 26:39.838
Morning.

26:39.974 --> 26:41.885
Afternoon, actually.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.009
Do you have to do that out here?

26:44.145 --> 26:47.137
The light's better. Late night?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.480
Dinner in Chinatown.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.349
Oh, my favorite.

26:51.486 --> 26:55.479
After a long shift, nothing better than big,
oily plates of Chinese food late at night

26:55.615 --> 26:57.947
in a garishly fluorescent—lit establishment

26:58.075 --> 27:00.817
of minimal decor and dubious hygiene.

27:00.953 --> 27:05.242
The floors are so greasy in this place,
you just skate to your table.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.285
— I know thatjoint — Big Wong.
- Mm.

27:07.418 --> 27:09.409
It's just great.

27:10.505 --> 27:13.838
Oh yeah. Uh...that's for you.
It was on the machine.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.378
504. That's New Orleans.
What was the message?

27:16.511 --> 27:18.843
Mm, I don't know.
Nick wrote it down.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.462
Susan. Susan Spicer.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.215
Oh, no shit?
Maybe she's got a job for you back home.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.183
Uh, no, thanks.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.143
Well, ask her if she's got a job for me.

27:33.069 --> 27:36.937
The problem is, the local thug talent went to
Houston after the storm and got educated.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.688
Graduate school.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.567
Met their Mexican suppliers,
eliminated the middleman,

27:41.702 --> 27:44.239
came back badder than ever,
chased the Crips and Bloods

27:44.372 --> 27:47.364
who were trying to move in
after Katrina back to LA.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.412
Well, there's a case
for some twisted civic pride.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.536
Only in New Orleans, yeah?

27:52.672 --> 27:54.537
Would be bad enough
if we had our act together.

27:58.094 --> 28:01.507
You know why they don't have a viable suspect
in the Helen Hill murder?

28:01.639 --> 28:03.504
They're looking at the husband.

28:03.641 --> 28:06.098
Shot three times holding their baby.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.933
They've finally backed off that.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.769
Even they could see how stupid
that was eventually.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.274
— Toni.
- Mm.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.766
— Good I ran into you.
- Majeeda.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.642
— You know Terry Colson?
— No.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.565
Majeeda Snead.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.563
She runs the law clinic over at Loyola.

28:20.700 --> 28:24.284
Remember that case l was
working on — Abreu? I gave it to them.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.869
I should update you on that sometime.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.284
Um, drop by the office when you have a sec.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.453
OK, lwill. Nice to meet you.

28:31.586 --> 28:33.497
You too.

28:34.380 --> 28:38.168
— You kicked it to the law clinic?
— I couldn't afford to keep it.

28:40.678 --> 28:42.919
You working Sunday?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.761
No.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.472
Pigeon Town Steppers second line,

28:46.601 --> 28:48.466
if they can get their fees together.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.218
You should come.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.094
Oh. (Chuckles)

28:52.231 --> 28:55.064
Have you ever been? Off duty?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.816
I'll think about it.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.270
If they can't get the money?

29:00.406 --> 29:02.146
Then you can come to the protest march.

29:02.283 --> 29:05.150
— Then I'll be working.
—(Laughs)

29:06.537 --> 29:10.530
I think you're gonna dig this place. It's not like
them old-style bead and feather stores.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.076
Ain't nothing wrong with them.

29:12.209 --> 29:15.701
Anything I can't get from Miss Helen
or Jefferson Variety,

29:15.838 --> 29:17.829
| order from them Koreans up here.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.081
ljust thought you might
want to see it, that's all.

29:20.217 --> 29:23.004
You might see something,
some trim for your suit.

29:26.349 --> 29:28.089
I already got trim for my suit.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.351
All right.

29:31.604 --> 29:34.562
You're right.
It ain't like them old stores.

29:34.690 --> 29:38.148
Look at the crystals and stones. Check out
some of these boas too for your apron trim.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.608
They got marabou?

29:39.737 --> 29:41.602
— They got everything.
— They got everything.

29:41.739 --> 29:45.072
Back already?
Are you making progress?

29:45.826 --> 29:47.532
Hey, Dave.
I want you to meet my daddy.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.527
I heard a lot about you. Dave Wilkins.

29:49.664 --> 29:50.949
Albert Lambreaux.

29:51.082 --> 29:53.073
I'm just about done beading that patch.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.416
— l'm—a need me some more gimp, Dave.
- No problem.

29:55.544 --> 29:56.875
And maybe some blue rose montees.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.086
— Let me see what I got in stock.
- OK.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.627
What's that for?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.250
You'll see.

30:05.429 --> 30:09.013
Gonna have to order those.
I don't have any set with backs.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.598
— Take a few days.
- That's cool.

30:13.062 --> 30:16.179
- Nice to meet you.
— Nice to meet you too, Dave.

30:18.943 --> 30:21.104
They got everything, huh?

30:23.155 --> 30:26.568
(Sofia) So in honor of the one thing
that has gone right this year,

30:26.701 --> 30:28.532
let me put it this way...

30:28.661 --> 30:30.697
Who dat gonna get crime under control?

30:30.830 --> 30:33.617
The NOPD?
Oh, wait, they're in jail.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.616
And who dat gonna rebuild our levees?

30:36.752 --> 30:38.162
The Army Corps of Engineers?

30:38.295 --> 30:40.126
Oh yeah, and exactly who believes them

30:40.256 --> 30:42.668
when they say they're gonna
get it right this time?

30:42.800 --> 30:44.882
And who dat gonna rebuild our houses?

30:45.011 --> 30:49.175
Mr. Mayor, you've got homeless people
sleeping in your fucking front yard.

30:49.306 --> 30:53.891
I mean, who dat gonna say anything
that isn't complete fucking bullshit?

30:58.441 --> 31:01.774
- Chef, do you have a moment?
— Yes, of course. How is it going?

31:01.902 --> 31:05.690
It's fine, Chef, fine,
but I have a problem back home.

31:05.823 --> 31:08.530
My sous chef, he's been arrested.

31:08.659 --> 31:10.650
He's in jail.
And they want to deport him.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.947
He's got his papers, but he's...
He's not...

31:13.080 --> 31:14.866
He's not illegal exactly, but...

31:15.916 --> 31:20.000
I know. It's confusing. lt's complicated.
And he needs help.

31:20.838 --> 31:23.124
Friends, lovers, marriage...

31:23.257 --> 31:24.542
they come and go.

31:24.675 --> 31:27.792
But your sous chef -
that's a lifelong relationship.

31:28.763 --> 31:30.424
— Go.
— Thank you, Chef.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.421
— Thank you.
— You're very welcome.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.758
(LaDonna) I'm going back to work.

31:37.438 --> 31:38.769
Soon.

31:39.982 --> 31:43.395
After carnival,
when things calm down.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.392
We'll see.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.487
And why'd you tell Mama
to put the house up for sale?

31:48.616 --> 31:50.857
Who am | to tell your mama anything?

31:50.993 --> 31:53.075
She's just as stubborn as you are.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.616
Where do you think | get it?

31:57.041 --> 31:59.453
(Both chuckle)

32:03.339 --> 32:04.328
(Chuckles)

32:08.177 --> 32:10.042
So she ain't been coming in nights at all, huh?

32:10.179 --> 32:12.966
Not most days, neither.
She's staying in Baton Rouge.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.465
Tsh! That'll get old. Quick.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.723
Thank you.

32:23.901 --> 32:25.892
— All right.
— Thanks.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.400
— What the fuck?
- For being late.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.114
Man, I didn't miss a note.

32:32.243 --> 32:34.199
Man, that last—minute shit ain't gonna cut it.

32:34.328 --> 32:36.114
Now you weren't here
on time for sound check

32:36.247 --> 32:38.488
and you were too loud
the whole fucking first set.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.330
Shit.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.451
— OK, it won't happen again.
— Damn straight, 'cause you're gone.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.126
- What the fuck?
— I gave you fair warning.

32:54.849 --> 32:56.635
(Speaking Dutch)

33:01.355 --> 33:06.145
Say, brah, I think hejust called you
a motherfucker in Dutch.

33:06.277 --> 33:08.313
Back at him.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.195
- (Door slams)
— What's up, chief?

33:15.327 --> 33:19.570
The busier we get, man,
the more these cats are fucking up.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.868
Man, that's just regular band shit.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.332
Regular shit, that's all.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.291
Yeah, I hear you.

33:25.421 --> 33:27.161
Listen, brah, lwant
to ask you something.

33:27.298 --> 33:29.084
I mean, you're an organized motherfucker.

33:29.216 --> 33:32.083
What if I gave you a little extra taste
and you can kinda sorta run things?

33:32.219 --> 33:33.959
That's your job. You're the leader.

33:34.096 --> 33:37.930
Look, | book the gigs, choose the songs,
hire and fire, you feel me?

33:38.058 --> 33:39.594
Artistic decisions.

33:39.727 --> 33:42.514
I'm talking about logistics, you know,
make sure cats are on time,

33:42.646 --> 33:45.809
fine them when they're late,
lining up last—minute subs if we need them,

33:45.941 --> 33:47.397
handle payroll, you know?

33:47.526 --> 33:49.767
Oh, you want me to be the straw boss.

33:49.904 --> 33:52.486
Yeah. 30 to start.

33:52.615 --> 33:53.775
How about 100?

33:53.908 --> 33:55.569
Tsh! 50.

33:57.578 --> 33:59.785
I'll let you keep
half the fines you collect.

33:59.914 --> 34:01.950
— Half the fines?
— Right.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.994
Well, shit, half the fines.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.163
I'm gonna get rich
off these motherfuckers.

34:07.296 --> 34:08.502
(Laughs)

34:09.840 --> 34:12.047
— I'm out, man.
- All right.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.963
— See you tomorrow night?
— Y'all gonna have to carry me tomorrow.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.507
I'm sitting in with Henry Butler
at the Howlin' Wolf.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.551
That's cool. l'll cover your shit.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.639
— Better singer anyway.
- Fuck you.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.930
— No, fuck you, brah.
— Fuck you.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.270
—(Laughs)
— (Snaps fingers)

34:26.398 --> 34:29.640
What? You fining me for
cursing that motherfucker?

34:29.777 --> 34:32.735
No, no, miss a gig...that's a fine.

34:32.863 --> 34:34.603
ljust told you it was happening.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.482
No, brah, less than 24—hour notice,

34:37.618 --> 34:39.449
that's a fineable offense.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.284
That's right. Pay the fuck up.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.493
In advance.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.831
— Oh, you motherfuckers.
— Thanks.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.951
(Band playing)

34:48.754 --> 34:51.496
J‘ The road home ain't no road home

34:51.632 --> 34:53.714
J‘ Sorry, but you need forms
J‘ Non, merci

34:53.842 --> 34:56.049
J‘ Sorry, you need forms
J‘ Non, merci

34:56.679 --> 34:58.795
J‘ Sorry, you need forms
J‘ Non, merci

34:59.390 --> 35:01.346
J‘ Uh, uh, uh

35:01.475 --> 35:03.340
J‘ I've been patiently waiting
here a long time

35:03.477 --> 35:05.889
J‘ Up in this long line
like I'm trying to use the john

35:06.021 --> 35:08.888
J‘ But I'm just trying to get
my little nickel and dime

35:09.024 --> 35:11.640
J‘ But they can't bring back what I lost
up in this city of mine

35:11.777 --> 35:14.894
J‘ Shit, I ain't got my papenNork,
Katrina came and left with it

35:15.030 --> 35:17.362
J‘ She took the car,
my clothes and all of my fillies

35:17.491 --> 35:20.073
J‘ She probably would have took my life
if I ain't take it with me

35:20.202 --> 35:22.659
J‘ But I ain't let her get me,
no, I ain't let her get me

35:22.788 --> 35:24.574
J‘ You bitches worser than the SBA

35:24.707 --> 35:26.868
J‘ I bet you get paid more
for keeping the people away

35:27.001 --> 35:29.083
J‘ And it's funny
how you call it "Road Home"

35:29.211 --> 35:31.452
J‘ So why all of my people in the streets
all alone?

35:31.588 --> 35:32.873
J‘ That's wrong

35:33.007 --> 35:34.998
J‘ Funny how you're calling it
"the Road Home"

35:35.134 --> 35:37.420
J‘ You got my people in the streets,
now they're all alone

35:37.553 --> 35:40.044
J‘ You wrap 'em up in red tape
and fuck with their head

35:40.180 --> 35:42.922
J‘ You might as well use duct tape
and shoot 'em dead

35:43.058 --> 35:45.265
J‘ So yeah, there ain't really no road home

35:45.394 --> 35:48.056
J‘ Keep the people wherever
you had them flown

35:48.188 --> 35:50.645
J‘ Man, ain't you happy
all the colored folks gone?

35:50.774 --> 35:53.311
J‘ Well, shit, who are you gonna
get to mow your lawn?

35:53.444 --> 35:55.901
J‘ Like the car in my driveway
and the swing on the tree

35:56.030 --> 35:58.897
J‘ All my documentation
got washed out to sea

35:59.033 --> 36:03.868
J‘ Home, home on the range

36:03.996 --> 36:06.578
J‘ Is this buffalo shit I'm stepping in?
Man, that's strange

36:06.707 --> 36:08.914
J‘ Naw, it ain't nothing
but shit from a bull

36:09.043 --> 36:11.625
J‘ When I'm talking about bullshit,
man, you is full

36:11.754 --> 36:13.665
J‘ Funny how you're calling it
"the Road Home"... J‘

36:13.797 --> 36:16.834
— (Muffled music blaring)
— (Bird chirping)

36:16.967 --> 36:19.959
— (Sousaphone solo playing)
- (Dishes rattling)

36:40.491 --> 36:41.697
(Woman) All right.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.611
- (Hangs up phone)
— Where does this go?

36:43.744 --> 36:46.076
Under "correspondence answered."

36:46.205 --> 36:51.199
Councilman Thomas can see you now,
but he has a conference call on the hour.

36:51.335 --> 36:52.916
Thank you.

36:53.045 --> 36:55.001
(Knocks) Knock, knock.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.460
What brings you here?

36:58.592 --> 37:01.174
— | wish it were playoff tickets.
— Isn't that something?

37:01.303 --> 37:03.965
The Saints in an NFC Championship Game
in my lifetime.

37:04.932 --> 37:07.093
Sadly, I got no pull in Chicago.

37:08.018 --> 37:10.259
But I am bearing a gift of a kind.

37:10.396 --> 37:13.809
I'm looking into buying
some real estate in mid—city.

37:13.941 --> 37:15.977
Let's just say I'm following a hunch.

37:16.110 --> 37:17.896
- A hunch?
— You can call it that.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.986
(Laughs) No offense,
but if fellas from Dallas, Texas,

37:21.115 --> 37:23.356
are already getting wind
of plans for lower mid—city,

37:23.492 --> 37:26.529
don't you think it's a little late
to be telling the council president?

37:28.163 --> 37:32.702
Son, I can almost hear the sound
of the file cards turning inside your head.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.996
What else you got in that bag of tricks?

37:35.129 --> 37:36.869
What else?

37:37.005 --> 37:38.836
Brother, I got a million of them.

37:42.302 --> 37:45.135
- Buy me a cappuccino.
— I thought you had a conference call.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.971
She always says that
in case I need an out.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.761
October '05, two months after Katrina,

37:53.897 --> 37:56.684
we got a phone call from one of the residents
of lberville Projects

37:56.817 --> 37:59.524
about a possible police shooting
a few days after the storm.

37:59.653 --> 38:03.271
Leon Seals, 29, body found
in a Crozat Street apartment,

38:03.407 --> 38:06.023
a single gunshot wound to the head,
close—range.

38:06.160 --> 38:09.152
"Undetermined, pending investigation."

38:09.288 --> 38:12.155
Our witness says Seals grew up
in the lberville.

38:12.291 --> 38:15.533
His family evacuated during the storm.
He stayed behind.

38:15.669 --> 38:17.876
Whoa, Mr. Seals.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.797
Arrests for armed robbery,
attempted murder,

38:21.925 --> 38:23.756
intent to distribute.

38:23.886 --> 38:25.877
And this is connected to Abreu...

38:26.013 --> 38:28.925
She says she saw three or four cops
chase Seals into the building.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.594
Then she heard gunshots — two of them.

38:35.022 --> 38:36.808
Can she identify the officers?

38:36.940 --> 38:38.555
If she can, she won't.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.603
I did convince her to walk me back
in the building

38:40.736 --> 38:42.522
and show me where the body had been.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.565
I found these...

38:44.698 --> 38:46.609
.380, semiautomatic.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.778
Holy shit.

38:48.911 --> 38:50.902
Same as Abreu.

38:51.038 --> 38:53.700
— Where is the police report?
— We have yet to locate one.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.039
And I filed for a public record request
a year ago.

39:00.839 --> 39:01.874
(Sighs)

39:02.007 --> 39:03.998
— (Thomas) Cables?
- Computer cables.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.876
You know how many of those
you order in a year?

39:07.012 --> 39:09.048
Three, four hundred thousand a year.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.172
You know how much
you're paying per cable?

39:11.308 --> 39:13.924
Buck—79 to buck—98 per unit.

39:14.061 --> 39:15.926
You know how much you should be paying?

39:16.063 --> 39:17.428
Less than a buck.

39:17.564 --> 39:20.397
So, for being a responsible public servant

39:20.526 --> 39:23.643
and putting the brakes
on some half—assed city procurement

39:23.779 --> 39:26.896
and giving the contract
to a reputable Dallas—based firm

39:27.032 --> 39:29.114
that can supply all your computer cable needs,

39:29.243 --> 39:32.827
you save the city
a quarter of a million a year.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.621
Right off the bat, before I even think
about picking up the phone

39:36.750 --> 39:38.411
and checking you out on this shit,

39:38.544 --> 39:40.330
there's something I need to ask you to do.

39:40.462 --> 39:41.542
Today.

39:41.672 --> 39:42.878
A show of good faith.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.664
Name it.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.792
(People chattering)

39:50.264 --> 39:52.471
(Gate buzzes)

39:52.599 --> 39:54.555
(Gate opens)

40:00.899 --> 40:02.890
Susan said it was a traffic stop.

40:03.026 --> 40:05.483
Yeah, a bad tail—light and bad papers.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.154
No papers?

40:13.787 --> 40:15.448
I'll tell you some other time,

40:15.581 --> 40:17.367
when | get out of here.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.159
Janette, they want to deport me.

40:22.296 --> 40:24.161
That's not gonna happen.

40:24.298 --> 40:25.663
We'll get the bail money raised.

40:25.799 --> 40:30.168
And what we really need is an immigration
lawyer. Susan's got contacts.

40:30.304 --> 40:32.260
Just don't throw a Sazerac at the Sheriff.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.718
Oh, you heard about that?

40:35.851 --> 40:39.184
You are now officially
a living legend of Louisiana.

40:39.313 --> 40:40.803
(Chuckles) Great.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.930
Me and Edwin Edwards.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.905
(Man) Yeah, chasing it now.

40:53.035 --> 40:54.900
You get any more ideas,
let me know, all right?

40:55.037 --> 40:56.402
— Mr. Henry.
- All right.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.495
You must be Nelson.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.116
Oliver told me you was coming,
but he didn't say why.

41:03.337 --> 41:05.453
(Sighs) So this is Pigeon Town?

41:05.589 --> 41:06.624
It's part of it.

41:06.757 --> 41:09.715
And you guys are having
a kind of parade, right?

41:09.843 --> 41:12.175
Second line. We do it every year.

41:12.304 --> 41:15.171
Pigeon Town Steppers.
I'm the president.

41:16.058 --> 41:17.923
You're short on cash
is what I understand.

41:18.060 --> 41:21.427
People have been donating,
but we're still about 2000 short.

41:21.563 --> 41:23.394
And we're down to the wire.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.980
— Supposed to go Sunday.
— Day after tomorrow?

41:26.109 --> 41:28.361
Got the band and everything.

41:28.487 --> 41:32.400
Well, compliments
of Hidalgo & Hidalgo of Dallas, Texas.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.482
Vaya con Dios.

41:39.039 --> 41:40.529
J‘ Let's go to Memphis

41:40.666 --> 41:42.452
J‘ In the meantime, baby

41:44.670 --> 41:48.288
J‘ I want to go to Memphis in the meantime, girl

41:49.466 --> 41:53.084
J‘ I want to go to Memphis
in the meantime, baby

41:53.220 --> 41:54.380
J‘ Yeah

41:55.013 --> 41:58.505
J‘ Talk about Memphis
in the meantime, girl J‘

42:14.616 --> 42:15.731
Whoo!

42:21.456 --> 42:23.833
(Cheering)

42:26.044 --> 42:28.205
See what I mean?

42:28.338 --> 42:29.748
He wrote all of these?

42:29.881 --> 42:31.917
One right after the other.

42:35.303 --> 42:37.385
Thank you so much.

42:37.514 --> 42:40.722
I'm no weatherman,
but I think it feels like rain.

42:40.851 --> 42:42.842
(Cheering and applause)

42:43.937 --> 42:46.394
(J‘ Feels Like Rain)

42:53.447 --> 42:55.403
Mm.

42:58.952 --> 43:01.113
J‘ Down here the river

43:02.789 --> 43:04.654
J‘ Meets the sea

43:11.423 --> 43:14.381
J‘ And in the sticky heat I feel you

43:16.011 --> 43:18.172
J‘ Open up to me

43:23.810 --> 43:25.186
J‘ Love

43:26.730 --> 43:29.346
J‘ Comes out of nowhere, baby

43:32.068 --> 43:34.320
J‘ Just like a hurricane

43:36.573 --> 43:39.315
J‘ And it feels like rain

43:39.451 --> 43:41.487
(Cheering)

43:43.747 --> 43:46.989
J‘ I said, it feels like rain...

43:50.962 --> 43:52.793
(Sighs)

44:09.064 --> 44:12.397
J‘ And it feels like rain

44:12.526 --> 44:18.487
J‘ Rain

44:18.615 --> 44:25.532
J‘ Feels

44:25.664 --> 44:27.746
J‘ Just like rain, feels like rain

44:27.874 --> 44:30.911
J‘ Tip—tap, tip—tapping
on my windowpane

44:33.713 --> 44:36.455
J‘ 'Cause it feels like rain

44:36.591 --> 44:38.877
J‘ Baby, can you feel it?

44:40.345 --> 44:44.213
J‘ Feels like rain, feels like rain

44:44.349 --> 44:46.931
J‘ Feels like rain

44:47.644 --> 44:49.760
J‘ Tip—tap

44:49.896 --> 44:52.433
J‘ 'Cause it feels like rain J‘

44:53.567 --> 44:55.558
(Cheering)

45:02.117 --> 45:03.732
It's a good song.

45:03.869 --> 45:06.656
It's a great song.
But what's great about it?

45:07.914 --> 45:09.450
Thank you.

45:09.583 --> 45:12.040
— (Annie) OK, for starters?
- For starters.

45:12.168 --> 45:13.874
The melody is cool.

45:14.004 --> 45:16.416
You know, it's simple like the blues,

45:16.548 --> 45:19.460
but it's not locked into
those chord changes.

45:19.593 --> 45:21.424
Yeah, the music gives you what it can.

45:21.553 --> 45:23.009
But keep going.

45:23.138 --> 45:26.596
Well, the lyrics — not so simple.

45:27.392 --> 45:31.135
I mean, he starts off
and he's singing about the weather,

45:31.271 --> 45:33.728
the river, the sea, you know.

45:33.857 --> 45:36.439
And you realize it's New Orleans.

45:36.568 --> 45:38.900
But then he isn't singing
about New Orleans.

45:39.029 --> 45:41.270
You know, it's really love
he's got on his mind.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.395
OK.

45:42.532 --> 45:45.365
And love is not simple.

45:45.493 --> 45:47.484
You know, it's a little dark sometimes

45:47.621 --> 45:51.205
— and a little dangerous, like New Orleans.
- Ha!

45:52.000 --> 45:55.333
And he's just riding it out
no matter how rough it gets.

45:57.088 --> 46:00.205
He's like us...
now, after the storm.

46:01.217 --> 46:03.549
Hiatt wrote that song
20 years ago, darling,

46:03.678 --> 46:05.839
when you still had training wheels
on your bike

46:05.972 --> 46:08.759
and nobody had ever heard
the name Katrina.

46:09.809 --> 46:11.140
Really?

46:11.269 --> 46:14.602
That's what makes it a great song.

46:20.612 --> 46:22.603
(J‘ Mama Roux)

46:29.037 --> 46:31.528
J‘ Is your man out of hand?

46:31.665 --> 46:33.997
J‘ Don't come home at night?

46:34.125 --> 46:36.662
J‘ And just because when he does

46:36.795 --> 46:39.252
J‘ He still don't treat you right

46:39.381 --> 46:41.542
J‘ And only love we're speaking of

46:41.675 --> 46:43.916
J‘ The fix is no big thing

46:44.052 --> 46:46.293
J‘ 'Cause for true, Mama Roux

46:46.429 --> 46:48.841
J‘ Can do most anything

46:48.974 --> 46:50.464
J‘ Mama Roux

46:50.600 --> 46:53.467
J‘ Fait la belle hoodoo

46:53.603 --> 46:55.639
J‘ Mama Roux

46:55.772 --> 46:57.512
J‘ Tell your troubles to

46:59.150 --> 47:00.856
J‘ Mama Roux

47:00.986 --> 47:03.853
J‘ Femme of New Orleans

47:03.989 --> 47:05.729
J‘ Mama Roux

47:05.865 --> 47:08.607
J‘ Queen of the hoodoo queens

47:46.197 --> 47:48.188
(Cheering)

47:52.245 --> 47:54.987
(Car stops, engine idling)

47:57.292 --> 47:58.498
(Sighs)

48:02.380 --> 48:04.962
— (Man) Bye.
— Later, guys. Bye.

48:15.351 --> 48:16.932
(Door slams)

48:17.062 --> 48:19.644
I think I'm starting to figure this place out.

48:19.773 --> 48:22.606
It's a village -
a village on an island.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.440
Everyone's connected.

48:24.569 --> 48:28.107
They may love each other. They may
hate each other, but they're all related.

48:28.239 --> 48:31.572
This week I bought an empty building
for a million—one

48:31.701 --> 48:34.693
and laid out a couple grand in a little bitty bar
at the back of town.

48:34.829 --> 48:39.038
Both of them on a handshake
and 'cause somebody told me to.

48:39.167 --> 48:40.998
It's all connected somehow.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.787
And I'm this close to seeing
how it all hooks up.

48:46.674 --> 48:48.665
Let me ask you something, darling.

48:49.636 --> 48:52.378
— You ever been to a second line?
— Sure.

48:52.514 --> 48:54.596
I haven't.

48:58.103 --> 49:01.891
— (Strumming guitar)
— (Annie) J‘ See my shadow on the wall

49:04.692 --> 49:08.935
J‘ It don't look like me at all

49:11.032 --> 49:12.863
(Humming)

49:36.391 --> 49:39.098
J‘ Until Mardi Gras is done... J‘

49:43.481 --> 49:45.346
— Looks great.
— Yeah.

49:46.651 --> 49:48.482
Thank you.

49:51.364 --> 49:53.355
(J‘ Dixieland jazz)

50:13.970 --> 50:14.959
(Door opens)

50:15.096 --> 50:18.463
OK, l have bagels with cream cheese and lox
and coffee.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.716
I'll have coffee.

50:20.852 --> 50:22.683
OK.

50:24.189 --> 50:26.305
How's it going?

50:26.441 --> 50:28.682
I'm gonna finish.

50:28.818 --> 50:31.104
When are we going to Brooklyn?

50:34.324 --> 50:36.315
Dad, I gotta tell you something.

50:36.451 --> 50:37.987
I'm not gonna be ready.

50:38.119 --> 50:40.235
Tell me something I don't know.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.282
I've been sewing, though.

50:48.504 --> 50:50.369
That's it? That's all you got, hmm?

50:50.506 --> 50:52.713
Wait, hold on now.

51:05.939 --> 51:08.146
Someone taught you how to sew, at least.

51:08.274 --> 51:10.265
(Chuckles)

51:11.486 --> 51:13.226
This lndian's missing a few tears.

51:13.363 --> 51:17.231
— That's what them blue rose montees is for?
— Mm—hm.

51:17.367 --> 51:19.699
Mm.

51:19.827 --> 51:21.283
That's not bad.

51:22.247 --> 51:24.078
That's damn good, actually.

51:25.875 --> 51:28.082
Well, too bad you ain't
got a suit to go with it.

51:28.211 --> 51:29.951
Maybe next year.

51:32.382 --> 51:33.792
It's for you, Daddy.

51:34.968 --> 51:36.708
Me?

51:36.844 --> 51:39.176
Yeah, I made it for you.

51:40.974 --> 51:42.680
This lndian...

51:44.644 --> 51:46.680
is you.

51:48.815 --> 51:50.555
This is your house.

51:53.403 --> 51:55.189
And the blue tarp.

52:06.249 --> 52:08.786
l was hoping you'd wear it this year.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.165
I'm hoping you make it out
Mardi Gras day.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.296
You gonna be there?

52:19.429 --> 52:20.635
I told you I would be.

52:20.763 --> 52:22.924
You told me you were sewing too.

52:24.892 --> 52:26.507
l have been.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.600
I'm just slow.

52:40.533 --> 52:42.569
(Doorbell rings)

52:52.587 --> 52:54.327
Mrs. Williams,

52:54.464 --> 52:56.625
is now a good time?

52:56.758 --> 52:58.919
Come in.

52:59.052 --> 53:01.759
— Your husband?
— He's in New Orleans for the day.

53:01.888 --> 53:03.628
My kids are at Sunday school.

53:03.765 --> 53:05.301
I skipped mass.

53:05.433 --> 53:07.094
(Chuckles) Me too.

53:07.226 --> 53:10.013
I tried your cell, thought I'd come up here,
see if I could catch you.

53:10.146 --> 53:13.183
I haven't picked up messages
in a couple of days. Please sit.

53:14.525 --> 53:18.689
I wonder if you wouldn't mind
looking at some photographs.

53:20.073 --> 53:21.938
We arrested a couple of men...

53:22.700 --> 53:26.158
for a similar incident in the same neighborhood
last week.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.824
Yeah, all right.

53:36.381 --> 53:39.748
No, I don't think so.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.595
Oh my God.

53:52.313 --> 53:54.304
— That's them.
— Are you sure?

53:55.566 --> 53:58.399
Damn it. God damn it.

54:00.279 --> 54:02.406
Him and him!

54:04.450 --> 54:05.656
God damn it!

54:05.785 --> 54:08.322
Good. That's who we arrested.

54:08.454 --> 54:11.036
Oh shit.

54:13.709 --> 54:16.576
- (Band playing)
_ (People chattering)

54:30.852 --> 54:32.467
(Cheering)

54:32.603 --> 54:34.594
(Man) Yeah!

55:34.457 --> 55:35.742
(Laughing)

55:37.418 --> 55:39.249
(Man) | see you over there, boy.

55:39.378 --> 55:42.085
Look at bigfoot. He can dance.

55:42.215 --> 55:43.580
So can I.

55:43.716 --> 55:45.081
Yes, you can.

55:45.218 --> 55:49.177
— Colson, you going native on us, huh?
- It looks different from out here.

55:49.305 --> 55:51.261
Yeah, right.
What are you gonna do now?

55:51.390 --> 55:54.132
You gonna quit and go join
the public defender's office or something?

55:54.268 --> 55:56.133
Come on, try it, Lonnie.

55:56.270 --> 55:57.851
Huh?

55:57.980 --> 55:59.686
(Laughing)

56:00.942 --> 56:03.228
- See this guy?
— No? It's not for you?

56:10.618 --> 56:13.735
Hey, I didn't think
this was gonna happen, huh?

56:13.871 --> 56:16.533
A last—minute benefactor, an angel.

56:16.666 --> 56:18.406
I don't know if I approve, you know.

56:18.543 --> 56:20.704
It sets a precedent
for paying the higher fees.

56:20.836 --> 56:22.747
— You wouldn't want this not to happen.
— No.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.838
No, and we will prevail
in court eventually, huh?

56:25.967 --> 56:27.878
That's what I admire about you, Toni,

56:28.010 --> 56:32.549
your faith in the system
despite all your experiences to the contrary.

56:32.682 --> 56:34.547
(Laughs)

56:48.739 --> 56:51.526
Sofia seems to be having a good time.

56:51.659 --> 56:54.651
It's a temporary reprieve.
She is so grounded.

56:54.787 --> 56:57.244
I wouldn't let her out for anything else.

56:57.373 --> 56:59.079
What did she do?

56:59.208 --> 57:01.199
— Broke the rules.
- I know.

57:01.335 --> 57:04.702
(Terry) And people think
you're a bleeding—heart liberal.

57:04.839 --> 57:08.297
Yes, punishment first,
then forgiveness.

57:09.260 --> 57:11.171
Wouldn't that be nice?
