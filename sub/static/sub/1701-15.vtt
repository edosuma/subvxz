00:02.711 --> 00:05.504
All right, no peeking. No peeking.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.548
No peeking. No peeking!

00:07.716 --> 00:11.552
All right, all right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.097
All right. Open your eyes!

00:21.062 --> 00:24.148
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.109
Huh? Days of our Lives
picked up my option!

00:27.277 --> 00:29.903
- Congratulations!
- I know! Ha-ha-ha.

00:30.113 --> 00:34.408
Now we can watch Green Acres
the way it was meant to be seen.

00:34.617 --> 00:38.203
So, uh, which one is mine?

00:38.371 --> 00:42.249
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

00:43.376 --> 00:45.044
Not that one.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.216
Oh, yes!

00:51.593 --> 00:54.887
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.222
Oh.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.267
- Do we dare?
- We dare.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.270
Oh.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.315
Oh!

01:55.073 --> 01:57.699
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

01:57.867 --> 02:00.369
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.247
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.625
They never would have survived
in the wild.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.918
This screen is amazing.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.171
- Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Uh-huh.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.010
Rose Marie really belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

02:17.720 --> 02:18.887
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.347
Hey.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.350
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.479
- Whoa, hey, whoa.
- Oh.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.023
So, uh, how was your day?

02:30.191 --> 02:31.692
Oh, you know, pretty much the usual.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.778
Uh, sun shining, birds chirping.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.155
Really? Mine too.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.157
Hey, cool! Mine too!

02:39.742 --> 02:41.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.288
I gotta get to the museum. So, um...

02:44.455 --> 02:47.166
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.129
Oh.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.423
Bye, guys!

02:54.591 --> 02:55.674
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.137
- Tonight?
- Hey, whoa.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.473
- What's tonight?
- It is our first official date.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.267
Our first date.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.478
Uh, ha, ha. Hello?

03:09.230 --> 03:10.772
Hi.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.194
Tonight? You're supposed to waitress
for me? My catering thing?

03:15.361 --> 03:18.697
- Any of that trigger anything?
- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

03:18.948 --> 03:20.699
This is our first date.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.952
- Yes, but my mom got me this job.
- I can be a waitress!

03:24.120 --> 03:27.414
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

03:27.582 --> 03:29.041
- Really, Pheebs?
- Uh-huh.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.709
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.754
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.423
I can be a waitress. Okay, watch this.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.884
Um, give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

03:39.135 --> 03:40.969
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

03:56.027 --> 03:57.319
It's James Bond!

03:59.364 --> 04:02.157
- Sorry we're late.
- That's okay. Come on in.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.827
Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.038
Dr. Burke, it's me.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.581
Monica?

04:09.749 --> 04:11.583
My God! You used to be so...

04:11.834 --> 04:15.420
I mean, you've...
You must have lost like...

04:18.048 --> 04:20.801
- You look great.
- Thank you.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.761
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.680
Hi, Phoebe. Nice to meet you.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.562
- So how you been?
- Great. How have you been?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.982
Oh, obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

04:35.233 --> 04:37.484
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.986
The head tilt?

04:39.153 --> 04:41.363
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

04:41.531 --> 04:44.491
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

04:44.701 --> 04:45.909
Oh.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.452
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.579
It's fine. Believe me, I do it too.

04:49.747 --> 04:54.459
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

04:54.877 --> 04:57.671
"You're sure?" "Yeah, I'm fine."

04:57.880 --> 05:00.424
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.760
Of course, the divorce only left me
with four CDs to change.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.555
Oh, that's too bad.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.849
I'll survive.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.269
Ward. With a reverse.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.605
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.607
But listen...

05:17.859 --> 05:20.444
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.322
Ring 20. Geller/Green.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.241
They'll let you in, okay?

05:28.619 --> 05:31.872
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.583
Okay, thanks.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.588
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.924
What if we have to pee?

05:46.095 --> 05:48.347
I'll cancel the sodas.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.394
Get back out there. It's your party!

05:54.645 --> 05:57.731
But they're so dull.
They're all ophthalmologists.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.649
You're an ophthalmologist.

05:59.817 --> 06:03.111
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.367
Ha, ha. That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.660
But you stay out there!

06:11.371 --> 06:13.538
- You see?
- All right, I tell you what.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.459
I'll come get you in five minutes with
some sort of, um, kebob emergency.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.710
Okay.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.129
Ah. Better.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.382
Oh, God, here we go.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.509
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.344
Watch this.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.805
Who needs glasses?

06:37.355 --> 06:40.190
- You are so smitten.
- I am not!

06:40.942 --> 06:43.318
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.153
Oh.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.072
- You should ask him out.
- Dr. Burke?

06:47.573 --> 06:51.743
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grown-up.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.914
So? You two are totally into each other.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.751
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.170
So you're never gonna see him again?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.756
Not never.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.218
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.556
- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
- Yeah, but, you know, uh...

07:12.807 --> 07:17.144
...27 is a dangerous eye age.

07:22.024 --> 07:26.319
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

07:26.487 --> 07:27.863
...hard to follow.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.282
I told you there'd be subtitles.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.492
I know.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.871
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.622
Oh.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.089
Monica?

07:49.552 --> 07:53.680
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.016
- Honey, I'm just checking.
- Oh.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.518
- Ahem. Monica?
- Mon?

07:58.686 --> 07:59.853
- Monica?
- Mon?

08:00.021 --> 08:02.105
Monica?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.843
What?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.636
- What?
- I'm sorry.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.932
I'm sorry. It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

08:37.099 --> 08:40.809
...it was like,
"Whoa, Ross' hands are on my butt!"

08:40.977 --> 08:42.229
Sorry.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.773
And that's funny why?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.734
Well, it's not. Uh...

08:47.902 --> 08:50.153
I mean, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.405
I mean, it's you.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.907
- You know, it's us.
- Mm.

08:54.075 --> 08:58.203
I mean, we're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.582
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.209
Okay.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.012
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.848
I know, I know, I know!

09:19.016 --> 09:22.018
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.191
I'm good. I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.611
No, see, now I can't, because, uh...

09:31.988 --> 09:33.530
...I'm feeling too self-conscious.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.657
- Just one cheek.
- No. Ha.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.826
The moment's gone.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.287
- I'll back up into your hands.
- That's romantic.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.538
- Touch it.
- No.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.415
- Oh, come on, squeeze it.
- No!

09:43.583 --> 09:44.708
- Rub it?
- No.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.377
Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?

09:55.469 --> 09:58.888
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire...

09:59.056 --> 10:02.142
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

10:02.351 --> 10:05.645
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.358
You've got a Cheeto on your face, man.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.489
Thanks.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.825
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.285
Ah.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.080
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.499
That was 14 hours ago.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.628
- So how'd it go?
- Well...

10:29.795 --> 10:32.631
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

10:32.798 --> 10:36.593
...and, uh, she started laughing?

10:37.386 --> 10:40.764
Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982...

10:40.931 --> 10:44.434
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.105
- She laughed at you?
- Yeah.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.858
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.486
You know,
I just want it to be perfect...

10:54.654 --> 10:58.156
...and right and...

10:58.949 --> 11:01.868
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

11:02.411 --> 11:05.872
- It's the Miracle Wax!
- It certainly is a miracle.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.666
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.501
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.253
Listen, I was, um, thinking about...

11:12.421 --> 11:13.672
Listen, can you guys speak up?

11:13.881 --> 11:17.133
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.471
Okay, listen.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.683
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.937
No. You know,
there's no need to make it up... How?

11:30.106 --> 11:34.067
Well, I was thinking maybe a, um...
Ahem, a romantic dinner...

11:34.318 --> 11:37.153
...with, um, candles and wine.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.865
And then, uh, ahem,
maybe going back to my place...

11:41.033 --> 11:43.660
...for, um, dessert.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.870
Hmm.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.580
That sounds...

11:47.748 --> 11:49.416
...perfect? Heh.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.719
- What's this?
- Would you get us a couple of beers?

12:06.142 --> 12:08.601
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.894
Really?

12:10.938 --> 12:12.063
Yeah, that's my job.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.109
All right. Look up.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.570
Look down.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.281
Now, open your eyes and look down.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.949
That's right.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.160
Look into the light.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.787
Now look at me.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.713
Okay.

12:39.216 --> 12:42.177
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.637
Good. They feel good.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.264
In my head.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.060
Um, so...

12:51.937 --> 12:54.647
- It was great to see you.
- You too.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.233
You too.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.069
Okay, um...

13:01.071 --> 13:02.822
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.617
- Drops!
- What?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.620
Drops. Here, they're free.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.375
Thanks. Uh, so...

13:14.543 --> 13:15.919
I guess I better be going.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.879
Oh, okay, yeah, I'll see you later.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.589
- Thanks again.
- Oh.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.926
Oh.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.314
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.692
- Hey, whoa, hey, whoa.
- Oh, oh.

13:39.860 --> 13:44.113
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

13:44.281 --> 13:47.450
No. Inside good.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.870
Outside bad.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.540
You guys are so pathetic.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.333
Oh, Xanadu!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.001
Oh!

13:59.046 --> 14:01.297
She's one of us now.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.842
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.677
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.721
We just wanted to stop by
and, uh, say good night.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.765
Good night.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.142
They won't even turn their heads.

14:13.310 --> 14:16.563
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.404
No, she's lying.

14:25.739 --> 14:30.285
Stop sending food to our apartment!

14:31.120 --> 14:32.328
Why are you dressed up?

14:32.746 --> 14:34.581
You're not the only one
who has a date.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.333
- What? You have a date? Who with?
- No one.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.253
- Come on, what's his name?
- Nothing.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.338
Come on, tell me.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.800
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

14:46.051 --> 14:49.053
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.680
I promise. What?

14:50.848 --> 14:53.141
- It's Richard Burke.
- Who's Richard Burke?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.976
Is that Dr...? Dr. Burke?

14:56.145 --> 14:59.272
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

14:59.523 --> 15:01.941
...should that bother me?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.027
I love that man. He's like, uh...

15:04.236 --> 15:06.738
...a brother to Dad.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.489
Well, for your information...

15:08.657 --> 15:12.327
...he is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.786
Dr. Burke is sexy?

15:13.954 --> 15:15.038
Oh, God!

15:15.205 --> 15:16.956
Absolutely!

15:18.626 --> 15:19.918
Damn!

15:20.085 --> 15:22.253
It's the museum again. Can I...? Oh.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.924
- You know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
- When?

15:26.091 --> 15:30.386
When I was, um, 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

15:30.596 --> 15:34.307
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.602
- Oh, you are so lucky!
- I know. Ha-ha-ha.

15:37.811 --> 15:41.397
Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.316
No, no.

15:43.484 --> 15:47.904
No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.239
Well, maybe he was nervous.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.707
Oh, look! I can't believe this!

15:59.959 --> 16:04.087
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.923
Why don't they just
give him a microwave? Heh.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.134
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.680
You know, I... It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.391
- That's okay. It's fine.
- Karl!

16:18.644 --> 16:20.311
Oh, God.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.702
- Wow! Is that Michelle?
- Yep.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.538
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.749
Oh, my God, that night she got so dru...

16:44.211 --> 16:45.503
Emotional.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.214
- You know, she's having another baby.
- Mm.

16:48.424 --> 16:52.427
- I thought she just had one.
- No, no. Henry's almost 2.

16:52.636 --> 16:55.638
And he's talking and everything. Here.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.889
Aw.

16:57.057 --> 17:00.727
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

17:00.936 --> 17:04.271
In all fairness,
his other grandpa's a drunk, but still...

17:05.898 --> 17:09.152
Whoa. You're a grandpa.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.321
Yeah.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.121
Are we nuts here?

17:20.622 --> 17:22.373
I don't know. Maybe.

17:22.540 --> 17:27.420
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.173
I didn't need to know that.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.468
I guess 21 years is a lot.

17:33.969 --> 17:38.681
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.601
Yeah.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.605
So...

17:48.650 --> 17:52.487
- So maybe we should just...
- Yeah.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.405
Yeah.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.407
Maybe...

17:59.787 --> 18:01.370
Wow.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.999
This really sucks.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.376
Yeah, it sure does.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.172
Ah.

18:24.103 --> 18:28.523
Uh, we don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

18:28.690 --> 18:31.484
No, there's no rush or anything.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.030
- Pizza delivery!
- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

18:38.909 --> 18:40.368
- Rach?
- Oh.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.994
- I'm done. Ah.
- Ahem.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.873
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is, uh, Sorentino's.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.544
I'm sorry. Let's, uh...
Why don't we find someplace else?

18:49.711 --> 18:53.172
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.715
No, no, we won't.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.175
We won't?

18:56.927 --> 18:58.427
Come on.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.596
Okay, that's dead, right?

19:02.933 --> 19:04.684
- What is this? What are we doing?
- Shh.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.271
- Do you want Cran-Apple or Cran-Grape?
- Grape.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.066
Okay, now...

19:12.317 --> 19:13.901
...sit.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.696
Okay.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.908
Oh, my God!

19:21.451 --> 19:24.912
Billions ofyears ago,
Earth was...

19:27.082 --> 19:28.207
Sorry.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.089
Ah. So, what are we looking at?

19:35.257 --> 19:40.136
Well, uh, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

19:40.304 --> 19:43.055
That is Ursa Major.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.601
- Really?
- No idea. It could be. Could be.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.148
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.442
Oh, that's okay.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.153
- You were worth the wait.
- Oh.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.281
And I don't just mean tonight.

20:01.992 --> 20:06.829
I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you

20:06.997 --> 20:08.581
Whoa.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.708
You're not laughing.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.003
This time it's not so funny.

20:18.759 --> 20:24.597
No, I don't want to fall in love

20:24.765 --> 20:27.600
This love is only gonna break your heart

20:29.269 --> 20:30.770
- Aah!
- Oh!

20:30.938 --> 20:33.147
Okay, loosen the knot.
Loosen the knot.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.066
Sorry, sorry.

20:41.949 --> 20:45.451
What a wicked game you play

20:46.328 --> 20:49.538
Aah! Oh, God! Oh.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.207
Honey?

20:51.375 --> 20:53.167
Oh, that's okay.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.044
What?

20:55.587 --> 20:58.673
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.808
Oh, thank God!

21:08.976 --> 21:20.653
No, I don't want to fall in love

21:20.821 --> 21:24.031
This love is only gonna break your heart

21:36.628 --> 21:38.129
Hey.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.339
Hey, you.

21:46.096 --> 21:49.056
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.684
I know. It is pretty unbel...

21:53.228 --> 21:56.272
- What?
- We're not alone.

22:22.341 --> 22:26.093
- Is that the fire alarm?
- Yeah.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.391
Oh, it's not warm yet.
We still have time.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.978
- Cool.
- Yeah, yeah. Cool!
