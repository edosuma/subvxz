00:07.966 --> 00:10.469
This is Channel 8 News
reporting with an update

00:10.511 --> 00:12.971
on yesterday's wild police
pursuit and shoot-out

00:13.013 --> 00:15.516
where three suspects
and one police officer

00:15.557 --> 00:17.976
were killed by gunfire
at Third and Jefferson.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.978
Shortly after being taken
into custody,

00:20.479 --> 00:22.481
Jose Fausto, the last suspect,

00:22.523 --> 00:24.483
was gunned down
by an unknown...

00:26.485 --> 00:28.487
Down! Everybody down! Down!

00:29.988 --> 00:31.490
Somebody shot this guy

00:31.490 --> 00:33.992
in front of all these cops?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.495
They did not want him
talking to us.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.498
This was not some
doped-up drive-by.

00:39.998 --> 00:40.999
The shooter had skill.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.001
Just one shot,
went through the ten ring.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.004
How'd they know
Fausto was here?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.506
I don't know.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.508
I bet you he tried to reach out
for help, you know?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.010
Maybe money or a ticket
out of here.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.011
I'll check the phone records

00:53.011 --> 00:55.013
and see if there was any calls
in or out.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.015
Glad I'm not Vartann.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.016
He's got to tell
the undersheriff.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.519
McKEEN:
Are you seriously

01:00.519 --> 01:03.021
telling me
our only live suspect,

01:03.021 --> 01:05.022
a cop killer, was gunned
down in your custody?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.525
I'm sorry
to say yes, sir.

01:06.525 --> 01:07.526
And you didn't catch
the shooter?

01:07.568 --> 01:08.527
That's also correct, sir.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.528
Stop calling me sir,

01:10.028 --> 01:11.780
you worthless...

01:11.822 --> 01:13.532
Where's Grissom?

01:13.532 --> 01:14.533
He's on his way.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.784
All right, let's start
without him.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.035
Sergeant Adams and Officer Bell

01:17.035 --> 01:20.038
were making a routine traffic
stop on a Buick.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.040
Before they were able
to effect the stop,

01:22.082 --> 01:24.042
a stolen Caprice intervened.

01:24.042 --> 01:27.045
Adams said they just cut him
off and started firing.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.550
They were followed in pursuit
by officers Davis and Carroll

01:31.592 --> 01:33.051
and detectives Brass
and Curtis.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.554
The, uh, Caprice TC'd
during the pursuit.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.560
They just kept firing.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.063
We got three of them
off of prints.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.064
Priors for narcotics

01:46.064 --> 01:48.567
and connections
to the Mexican Mafia.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.069
An additional set of prints
from the Caprice

01:51.111 --> 01:52.863
came back to Jose Fausto,

01:52.905 --> 01:54.489
the guy shot
at the motel.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.074
I've heard enough about him.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.577
Why would these knuckleheads
pull in front of a police car

01:58.619 --> 02:01.079
making a traffic stop
and engage us in a gunfight?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.581
If the Buick was moving drugs,

02:02.581 --> 02:04.583
maybe the Caprice was providing
security,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.585
keeping the cops
and rival gang members away.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.086
We don't have the Buick,

02:08.086 --> 02:09.588
so there's no evidence
to confirm that.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.590
Well, if these guys were a bunch
of drug-dealing thugs,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.091
why, on the news,
were they unarmed

02:13.133 --> 02:14.593
and we shot 'em
in the back?

02:14.593 --> 02:16.595
'Cause that's what
the eyewitnesses are saying.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.098
And that we shot
an innocent high school kid

02:20.140 --> 02:21.600
riding his bike.

02:23.602 --> 02:28.106
Uh, Ricardo Estevez,
male Hispanic, 22,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.609
shot in the alley east of Third.

02:31.109 --> 02:34.863
Three entrance wounds to the
front torso, none to the back.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.617
Ballistics matched the bullets
to Sergeant Carroll's gun.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.119
Recovered a.45 auto
next to the body.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.123
Captain Brass states the suspect
had it pointed at the sergeant

02:45.165 --> 02:46.625
when he came around
the corner.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.626
We have eyewitnesses

02:47.626 --> 02:50.128
who claim that they saw the
suspect with his hands raised

02:50.170 --> 02:51.129
just before he was shot.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.633
Can we resolve this?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.635
Sergeant Carroll

02:56.635 --> 02:59.638
partially confirms
eyewitness accounts.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.140
When Captain Brass approached,

03:02.140 --> 03:04.142
he momentarily took his eyes
off the suspect.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.645
When he looked back,
the suspect was holding a gun.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.146
Probably pulled it
from his waistband.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.648
There's no evidence

03:09.648 --> 03:11.650
to place the gun in the
suspect's hand at that point.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.151
What about the guy
in the other alley?

03:14.653 --> 03:20.659
Salvador Rosario, 19,
also shot in the front.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.664
Autopsy's pending.

03:25.664 --> 03:30.669
Chemical tests show
that he held a gun.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.671
You're not going
to believe this.

03:32.671 --> 03:38.177
A bullet from Officer Davis'
gun hit the suspect's revolver,

03:38.218 --> 03:39.678
jamming the cylinder.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.180
That would mean the revolver

03:41.180 --> 03:43.182
had to be pointing
at Officer Davis.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.685
There are several eyewitnesses
who claim that they saw him

03:46.727 --> 03:48.187
plant the gun on the body.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.688
It wasn't planted.
It was mishandled.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.231
Mishandled by who?

03:51.273 --> 03:52.691
Contrary to policy,

03:52.691 --> 03:55.694
Officer Davis prematurely
picked up the gun.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.487
Detective Curtis instructed him

03:57.529 --> 03:58.864
to set it back down,
which he did.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.199
What are you doing?
Put it down.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.201
Sorry, I was just trying
to secure his gun.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.203
An eyewitness seeing that

04:04.203 --> 04:06.705
certainly could misinterpret it
as planting a gun.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.962
Please tell me
you've got some good news.

04:14.004 --> 04:18.216
I have the autopsy findings
on Leandro Chavez.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.219
He died of survivable wounds.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.720
Bled out

04:21.720 --> 04:23.722
at the crime scene
waiting for transport.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.226
Dame una ambulanica quey.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.727
I don't speak Spanish.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.479
There's justification for this.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.231
I can't wait to hear
what that is.

04:32.231 --> 04:35.234
Paramedics prioritized
transport of the injured.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.735
Downed officer first,

04:36.777 --> 04:37.736
civilians next.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.238
By the time
they got to the suspect,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.240
he'd passed on.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.492
Just a little retroactive
birth control.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.744
See, this is the problem
that the community

04:45.786 --> 04:47.246
has with us.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.248
You don't speak Spanish, so you
think they don't speak English,

04:49.748 --> 04:50.749
and then, when you run
your mouth...

04:50.791 --> 04:52.251
All right, keep on point here.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.255
Which one of these buttheads
shot Officer Bell?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.258
We have reason to believe
that Officer Bell

04:59.299 --> 05:01.260
was killed by friendly fire.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.764
It was a through-and-through,

05:06.265 --> 05:07.766
and we haven't recovered
the bullet yet.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.268
It's a big crime scene.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.769
Unacceptable.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.521
Get back out there
and find that bullet.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.273
I don't care
if it takes everybody you got

05:14.773 --> 05:15.774
working around the clock.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.277
I said we haven't found ityet.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.779
I didn't say we weren't looking.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.789
? Who... are you?

05:30.789 --> 05:33.292
? Who, who, who, who??

05:33.792 --> 05:36.795
? Who... are you??

05:36.795 --> 05:38.547
? Who, who, who, who??

05:38.589 --> 05:40.299
? I really want to know?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.801
? Who... are you??

05:42.801 --> 05:45.304
? Oh-oh-oh!?
?Who...?

05:45.304 --> 05:48.307
? Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

05:48.348 --> 05:51.810
? Oh, you!?

05:55.314 --> 05:56.815
Just do
whatever it takes

05:56.857 --> 05:57.816
to find that bullet.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.568
Don't worry
about the overtime.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.320
As soon as day
shift comes in,

06:01.361 --> 06:02.321
I'll send them
out, too.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.822
Hey, Grissom.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.324
So Warrick recovered
a nine-millimeter pistol

06:05.824 --> 06:06.825
from Fausto's motel room,

06:06.825 --> 06:08.827
and I matched it to
the cartridge case

06:08.869 --> 06:10.329
from the kid
in the hospital.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.830
He also found the
kid's bike there.

06:13.332 --> 06:17.336
Shot him in the back
for his bike. Great.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.837
Hey.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.840
I left you a couple of messages.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.344
Oh, yeah? I haven't
gotten to them yet.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.845
Sorry.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.597
You're on administrative
leave, though.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.349
You should be home
getting some rest.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.850
Yeah, I tried.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.354
But I...

06:35.354 --> 06:39.358
can't stop thinking about
this... this Bell shooting.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.361
It's understandable.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.863
Grissom, I think
there may be a possibility

06:44.905 --> 06:49.368
that maybe... I shot him.

06:49.368 --> 06:53.372
Sofia... we can't discuss
the investigation.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.665
It's, it's something
I remembered

06:54.706 --> 06:55.791
when I was giving my statement.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.875
Then it's already
on the record.

06:56.917 --> 06:57.876
No, something
I didn't mention.

06:57.918 --> 06:58.377
Sofia...

06:58.877 --> 06:59.378
Please listen to me.

07:01.380 --> 07:05.884
Bell was between me
and the suspect.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.388
I was shooting over his cover,
which is a violation of policy.

07:13.392 --> 07:17.396
I was... I was just trying
to stay alive.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.398
But, if I did it, I...

07:19.898 --> 07:21.900
Hey, Grissom,
I have a question.

07:23.402 --> 07:24.903
Sofia?

07:26.405 --> 07:28.907
You're on administrative leave.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.909
I know.

07:30.909 --> 07:31.910
You should not be
in this building.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.453
I was just talking to a friend.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.913
If I can't talk to a friend,

07:34.913 --> 07:36.665
who the hell
am I supposed to talk to?

07:36.707 --> 07:38.417
Any friend
outside the department.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.919
And how many friends
outside work do you have, Sara?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.921
Maybe I should go
talk to my mother.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.923
Oh, no. Sorry. I forgot.
She's a cop, too.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.925
I can recommend
a departmental psychologist.

07:54.933 --> 07:55.934
You're right, um...

07:55.934 --> 07:58.937
This was a really bad idea.
I'm sorry.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

08:19.458 --> 08:20.959
Hey, listen.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.961
One of the officers
searching for the shooter

08:22.961 --> 08:25.964
found an expended cartridge
up there on the seventh floor.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.971
That would put him
in the right position.

08:33.013 --> 08:33.972
Fremont Street's not far.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.474
Makes for an easy escape.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.483
Good job.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.998
Nice.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.018
.223 Remington.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.520
Most likely from a semiauto.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.021
Didn't even bother
to pick it up.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.524
Yeah. Wasn't afraid
of getting caught.

09:25.524 --> 09:29.528
I'll give it to Bobby.
Have him run it through IBIS.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.530
See if the gun was used before.

09:31.530 --> 09:35.033
Vartann, this is Cavaliere.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.536
We've recovered an expended
.223 cartridge case

09:37.578 --> 09:39.538
from a building
overlooking the motel.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.039
It's on the way to the lab now.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.583
Scene is secure.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.042
Patrol just called

09:44.042 --> 09:47.546
and they found a 411-A
behind 5203 Maryland Parkway.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.549
Sounds like it might be
the Buick Regal.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.051
I'm going
to head over there now.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.559
Buick Regal, no plates.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.561
You run the VIN?

10:02.561 --> 10:04.563
Yeah. It came
up stolen.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.566
It's a good chance this
is the car we're looking for.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.571
Yep.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.573
Torched it to destroy
any evidence.

10:14.573 --> 10:18.076
Let's get this thing
towed back to the lab, okay?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.578
You got it.

10:19.578 --> 10:22.080
Sergeant Adams,
this is your standard

10:22.122 --> 10:24.583
after-shooting walk-through,
okay?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.585
Now, I want you
to describe to us

10:26.585 --> 10:28.587
exactly what happened
yesterday morning.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.089
We were southbound
on Roosevelt.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.092
Bell observed a male
and female Hispanic

10:34.134 --> 10:36.595
having a domestic
dispute.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.096
Where were they?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.598
Over in that last spot.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.601
They got out
of a green Geo Metro.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.103
Walked this way.
By the time we'd turned around,

10:45.145 --> 10:47.105
they'd gotten
into the Buick Regal.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.107
They were driving away.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.610
She was pregnant,
about to pop,

10:51.652 --> 10:52.611
just like Bell's wife.

10:52.611 --> 10:53.612
He said we should
pull 'em over.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.656
Which way'd they go?

10:55.697 --> 10:57.616
Southbound on Roosevelt.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.619
As soon as we turned
on Desert Springs,

11:00.661 --> 11:01.620
the Caprice cut us off.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.621
Okay, thanks.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.623
Hey, hang around for about
a minute or two, okay?

11:04.665 --> 11:06.124
I'll give you
a ride home.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.127
Your thoughts?

11:09.127 --> 11:10.629
I wonder if that camera works.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.132
Well, it's worth checking out.

11:14.633 --> 11:15.634
Come on. I'll even let
you buy me a doughnut.

11:39.658 --> 11:42.661
I got to the end
of my road.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.164
And? Well, the suspect started shooting

11:45.164 --> 11:47.666
near the intersection of
Jefferson and Desert Springs.

11:47.708 --> 11:51.670
That's nearly 20 blocks north
of the crime scene.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.172
All ammo evidence was

11:53.172 --> 11:55.174
7.62-millimeter
casings and bullets.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.675
Only AK ammo?

11:56.675 --> 11:59.178
No police cartridge cases
or bullets?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.180
Not one out of 233 items.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.182
But cops don't get
to shoot car-to-car.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.683
Only bad guys do, right?

12:07.686 --> 12:09.688
Oh, hey, Greg.
Been on vacation?

12:11.190 --> 12:13.192
Look, I know the undersheriff's
on your back,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.694
so I figured I better
get to you quick.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.196
Okay, you got to me.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.199
Found red clay chips and dust

12:20.199 --> 12:23.702
in the gouges
on Ricardo Estevez's.45.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.204
He was the guy

12:25.204 --> 12:27.206
that was in the east alley
with Brass.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.707
Red clay chips?

12:28.707 --> 12:31.210
Traces consistent with
roof tiles and clay pots.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.711
Who keeps their gun
in a clay pot?

12:32.753 --> 12:35.005
That would be no one.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.216
Trace evidence is fresh,

12:37.216 --> 12:39.968
so it definitely
came from the alley.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.721
In a crisis, you can
always count on me.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.227
Doesn't he bug you?

12:48.227 --> 12:51.230
No more so than anyone else
around here.

13:20.259 --> 13:23.262
Sara, will you come with me
to the east alley, please?

13:23.303 --> 13:26.265
I thought my top priority,
as per the undersheriff,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.267
was finding the bullet
that went through Bell.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.810
Well, this is per me.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.270
Come on.
It'll be fun.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.272
Okay.

13:47.286 --> 13:48.787
Sara?
Yeah?

13:48.787 --> 13:50.289
Call Hodges at the lab.

13:50.789 --> 13:53.292
Have him bring
two exemplar.45s out here.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.295
I'll get Ortega to bring
Brass and Sergeant Carroll.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.298
Are... you gonna tell me
what's going on?

13:59.339 --> 14:02.801
What goes up... must come down.

14:08.307 --> 14:10.809
So, where, exactly
was Estevez standing

14:11.310 --> 14:13.812
when you guys saw him?
Right there,

14:13.854 --> 14:15.314
facing this way.
That's right.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.816
And he had a gun in his hand.
He had a gun in his hand.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.318
And I shot a, uh,
armed suspect

14:19.318 --> 14:21.320
who'd been shooting
at the police, sir.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.321
I believe you.

14:22.821 --> 14:25.324
But the witnesses
may also be right.

14:25.324 --> 14:26.825
Look, don't make this
some intellectual exercise

14:26.867 --> 14:28.827
for your own
personal amusement.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.829
Check it out.
Hodges, stand over here.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.581
Yes, sir.

14:32.623 --> 14:33.749
Right here.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.833
See that roof?

14:37.336 --> 14:38.337
It's red clay.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.839
Toss one of the guns up there.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.592
Actually,
they're Bobby Dawson's guns.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.345
He made me sign
for them- I'm sure

14:46.345 --> 14:48.347
he wouldn't appreciate
if we brought them back damaged.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.350
Technically, they'remyguns-
so toss one up there.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.356
Just for the record, I've never
really been good at sports.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.649
Sara?

14:58.690 --> 14:59.858
Yeah.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.873
How does that prove
the guy tossed the gun up there?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.375
You recovered it
from the ground.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.377
There's a cracked tile
up on the roof.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.878
I found a series of scratches

15:19.878 --> 15:22.881
stretching from the cracked
tile to the end of the roof.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.383
I found scratches
and red clay dust

15:24.424 --> 15:25.884
in the suspect's.45.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.387
It explains how
the witnesses

15:28.387 --> 15:31.890
could see Estevez with his hands
up, and Sergeant Carroll

15:31.932 --> 15:33.892
then saw him with a gun
in his hand.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.895
The gun's still up there.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.400
Sara...

15:41.400 --> 15:43.402
try it again.

15:48.907 --> 15:49.908
Stop! Police!

15:49.950 --> 15:51.201
Get down!

15:51.243 --> 15:52.411
Don't move.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.430
There you have it.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.432
There's the Geo Metro.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.434
That's our Buick Regal.

16:17.436 --> 16:20.439
Oh, she's pregnant,
all right.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.941
Doesn't look like she
wants to go with him.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.945
He's not giving her
much choice.

16:26.945 --> 16:31.450
So, just how bad was the meeting
with the undersheriff?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.952
Worse than the dentist.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.954
Better than the proctologist.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.456
Hmm.

16:37.456 --> 16:40.459
What's he doing?

16:40.459 --> 16:42.461
Looks like he's pulling out
a hide-a-key.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.966
Means the car
was waiting for them.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.968
Whatever they were about to do,

16:49.968 --> 16:52.971
they weren't going to do it
in the Metro.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.481
Hey, Nick?
Hey.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.983
Have you checked the
inside of the wheel wells?

17:05.025 --> 17:07.486
No. I was having
too much fun in here.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.987
Yeah, I can see that.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.990
Um, well...
since you're already dirty,

17:12.491 --> 17:15.493
would you mind checking out
the left rear one for me?

17:15.536 --> 17:17.496
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

17:19.498 --> 17:20.999
What are you looking for?

17:20.999 --> 17:25.002
I am looking for something
to hide a key in.

17:25.002 --> 17:29.007
Okay. Although, most hide-a-keys
are held on with a magnet,

17:29.049 --> 17:31.301
which would've been demagnetized

17:31.343 --> 17:33.512
by the heat
of the gasoline fire.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.514
Right.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.016
Nope.
Well,

17:38.016 --> 17:40.018
it probably fell off
at the location.

17:40.018 --> 17:44.523
Maybe. Auto transport
usually sweeps up the debris.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.025
Good luck with that.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.621
My son was riding his bike
to school.

19:22.663 --> 19:25.415
Now he's in a coma.

19:25.457 --> 19:28.126
But, when he wakes up,

19:28.126 --> 19:34.132
when he... opens his eyes again
and smiles at his mother,

19:34.174 --> 19:38.637
he will see all the... flowers

19:38.637 --> 19:41.640
and cards that he's been sent
from total strangers

19:41.682 --> 19:44.184
wishing him well and...

19:44.226 --> 19:46.645
praying for his recovery.

19:46.645 --> 19:50.649
Sheriff Burdick hasn't called.

19:50.649 --> 19:54.152
I've left so many messages
I've lost count.

19:54.653 --> 19:57.155
It's inconvenient, I know,

19:57.197 --> 19:59.700
but I have questions.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.703
Who did this to my son?

20:02.744 --> 20:05.664
Why did they do it?

20:05.664 --> 20:08.167
No one wants to answer me?

20:08.167 --> 20:11.170
If the cops didn't shoot him,
why won't they talk to me?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.672
If I have to go to court
to find out-

20:14.173 --> 20:16.675
if I have to sue each
and every officer involved-

20:16.717 --> 20:18.177
I'll do it.

20:18.177 --> 20:21.180
I will put the sheriff
in front of a jury

20:21.221 --> 20:23.182
and get my answers there.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.188
McKeen.

20:29.188 --> 20:32.191
Yes, sir. I saw the news.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.943
I still think we should wait
to issue a statement,

20:34.985 --> 20:37.696
at least until the lab
has something concrete.

20:38.197 --> 20:41.200
Hodges, it's not so much that
these guns are my babies, okay?

20:41.241 --> 20:43.202
It's just that, in order
to replace them,

20:43.202 --> 20:46.205
I got to go to Property,
got to locate another gun,

20:46.246 --> 20:47.206
fill out all this paperwork,

20:47.206 --> 20:48.957
so all I'm saying is,
I would appreciate

20:48.999 --> 20:50.709
not being left out
of the loop, okay?

20:50.751 --> 20:52.211
I'm only a soldier in this war.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.213
The general gave me an order,
and I followed it.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.715
Whatever.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.717
I've finished checking
this batch for trace.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.219
Bobby, please tell me
you entered

21:00.219 --> 21:02.221
the cartridge case
from the sniper into IBIS.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.722
It has become my priority.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.724
Or so I was informed
by Undersheriff McKeen.

21:05.766 --> 21:06.725
Give me about an hour?

21:06.767 --> 21:08.227
Cool.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.990
I got blood.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.243
Where's it from?

21:24.243 --> 21:26.745
Expended bullet, Torres house,
candle in the living room.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.247
That's our
through-and-through.

21:28.247 --> 21:32.251
Looks like a copper-jacketed
nine-millimeter,

21:32.292 --> 21:34.253
consistent with cop ammo.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.262
Brass, Sofia,

21:43.262 --> 21:46.765
Adams, Davis and Carroll
were all shooting nines.

21:46.807 --> 21:48.267
Compare it with their
firearms ASAP.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.269
I'm gonna go
tell Grissom.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.278
Looking for something?

22:00.279 --> 22:03.282
At least this car still has
a nice hubcap.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.783
Where'd you find that?

22:04.783 --> 22:08.287
On the pursuit route, Jefferson,
about ten blocks north of Third.

22:08.328 --> 22:12.291
Well, I've been through
this car twice.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.293
There's no evidence
of cartridge casings, blood,

22:14.334 --> 22:15.794
drugs of any kind.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.796
So there was nothing
here to begin with

22:17.796 --> 22:20.299
or they cleaned it out pretty
good before they torched it.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.800
Hey, Nick, Grissom.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.802
We found the through-
and-through bullet.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.304
Bobby's doing a comparison.

22:25.304 --> 22:27.306
I sent a sample of blood to DNA.

22:34.313 --> 22:35.814
Hey.

22:39.818 --> 22:40.819
I'm glad you called.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.321
I've been thinking
about you.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.822
Good. Yeah,
I wasn't sure.

22:45.824 --> 22:46.825
How you doing?

22:49.328 --> 22:51.330
I'm going a little crazy.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.332
Yeah. It's the waiting.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.334
Yeah.

22:55.334 --> 22:58.337
You know, I've been
suspended or disciplined

22:58.378 --> 22:59.838
like six or seven times,

22:59.838 --> 23:02.841
and it's always the same-
the waiting.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.344
What you never forget is that,

23:05.344 --> 23:07.846
you know, a police officer
lost his life.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.853
I've seen it so many times,

23:14.853 --> 23:16.855
I don't know
if it's real or not.

23:18.357 --> 23:21.109
Jim, it's like
he's looking at me-

23:21.151 --> 23:23.862
like as if he...
as if he knew.

23:23.862 --> 23:27.366
Sofia, you got to get that
out of your head. That's poison.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.868
You telling me
you're not thinking about it?

23:29.868 --> 23:31.870
Oh, I'm thinking; I'm thinking
about a lot of stuff.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.881
...leaving one officer
killed in the crossfire

23:42.923 --> 23:45.384
and an entire community
traumatized

23:45.425 --> 23:47.386
for a very long time
to come.

23:49.388 --> 23:50.389
Let me tell you something.

23:50.389 --> 23:52.140
You know, when I was a young cop

23:52.182 --> 23:53.892
in Jersey,
there was this kid,

23:53.892 --> 23:55.894
responding to
an "all shots fired. "

23:55.894 --> 23:58.397
Jumped out of the radio car,
never knew what hit him.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.898
I was the first officer
on the scene-

23:59.940 --> 24:02.401
a patrolman, too.

24:02.401 --> 24:04.903
You know, it tore up the
department pretty good.

24:04.945 --> 24:08.699
Everybody was all twisted and...

24:08.740 --> 24:12.411
but we managed somehow to...

24:12.411 --> 24:14.413
I don't know,
get through it, some way.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.418
Who shot him?

24:20.919 --> 24:22.921
It really doesn't matter.

24:27.426 --> 24:29.428
Itdoesmatter.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.931
I could see Bell's face
when I was shooting him,

24:33.432 --> 24:36.935
which means I was...
I was shooting near him.

24:36.977 --> 24:37.936
I made a mistake.

24:37.936 --> 24:39.438
I shouldn't have fired.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.939
No, come on. It was chaos.

24:40.939 --> 24:41.940
You were just responding
to a situation.

24:41.982 --> 24:44.443
It was instinct,
it was training.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.446
Don't, don't
think that way.

25:02.461 --> 25:05.464
I'm always going to be
the cop who shot a cop.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.970
There's the green
Geo Metro.

25:12.012 --> 25:13.514
Okay, you
come with me.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.973
You two cover the back.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.475
Stay with her.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.483
Police! We have
a search warrant! Open up!

25:26.985 --> 25:27.986
Hey!

25:28.987 --> 25:30.989
Suspect's on the run!

25:45.003 --> 25:48.006
He's gonna meet you here.
Come on. Let's go.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.049
We have her, Detective.

25:49.091 --> 25:50.008
Wow. You had the baby

25:50.008 --> 25:52.010
and got your figure back
in one day.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.053
That's impossible.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.012
Believe me, I know.

25:54.012 --> 25:55.013
My wife's had
five kids.

25:59.518 --> 26:01.019
Oh, Tina, baby- no.

26:01.019 --> 26:04.022
Peanut butter
without the jelly?

26:04.022 --> 26:07.025
She's trying to get me
to cut down on sugar,

26:07.067 --> 26:08.026
but this is ridiculous.

26:08.068 --> 26:10.320
Here.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.531
Thanks.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.033
Do you ever want to be a cop?

26:15.033 --> 26:17.536
Every time I get
a speeding ticket, yeah.

26:17.578 --> 26:20.038
No, I mean like guns
and car chases

26:20.038 --> 26:22.541
and "Put your back against
the wall," that kind of stuff.

26:22.583 --> 26:26.044
No, I prefer the scientific side
of law enforcement.

26:26.086 --> 26:27.045
Me, too.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.303
Brown.

26:34.344 --> 26:35.554
Hey, Cath.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.556
Got the couple
driving the Buick.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.057
Female wasn't pregnant.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.058
She was a mule.

26:40.559 --> 26:41.560
Really.

26:41.560 --> 26:45.063
Found her rig for transporting
narco inside the house,

26:45.105 --> 26:48.567
and unless these guys were
in the mail order business,

26:48.609 --> 26:50.569
I think they were
being shipped drugs.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.070
And delivering them

26:52.070 --> 26:54.573
to the guys up the food chain.
Yeah.

26:54.573 --> 26:57.075
You think these are the same
guys who whacked Fausto?

26:57.117 --> 26:59.077
It's the best lead we've got.

27:02.498 --> 27:04.500
You were a passenger
in a stolen vehicle

27:04.500 --> 27:05.959
that failed to yield
to the police.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.503
We've also connected
you to a drug ring,

27:07.503 --> 27:08.962
which was responsible

27:09.004 --> 27:13.008
for the death of
a police officer.

27:14.510 --> 27:15.511
Miss Guerro?

27:18.013 --> 27:22.017
You're looking at prison
time, so think about it.

27:22.017 --> 27:23.519
Whatever you could tell
us about these guys

27:23.519 --> 27:25.521
will be in your best interest.

27:29.024 --> 27:32.528
Surveillance footage
from Angie's Donut Shop

27:32.528 --> 27:34.530
shows you
carrying drugs

27:35.030 --> 27:37.032
and getting into
the delivery car.

27:37.032 --> 27:39.034
That alone gets you ten years.

27:40.536 --> 27:42.996
Okay, this is
your last chance

27:43.038 --> 27:44.540
for your client to
help herself out.

27:53.549 --> 27:55.050
You don't understand.
We had no choice.

27:55.050 --> 27:56.552
They would have killed us.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.011
Who would've killed you?

27:58.053 --> 27:59.805
There is nothing
that you can do to me

27:59.805 --> 28:01.557
that is worse
than what they can do.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.019
I'm done.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.521
I'm not talking no more.

28:07.563 --> 28:10.065
Mr. Contranos has served time
for narcotics possession.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.525
He's been deported
three times

28:11.567 --> 28:13.026
for entering
the country illegally.

28:13.068 --> 28:15.028
This time, we're going
to throw away the key.

28:15.070 --> 28:18.073
Mr. Contranos has no interest
in speaking to you.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.825
We're talking about
the difference between

28:19.867 --> 28:21.577
life without parole
and the needle, here.

28:21.577 --> 28:24.079
He's prepared to do his time.

28:30.586 --> 28:32.337
Grissom, we managed
to get a hit

28:32.337 --> 28:34.047
off of that sniper
cartridge case.

28:34.089 --> 28:37.593
Links up to a drug rip-off
in L.A. last year- unsolved.

28:37.593 --> 28:39.052
What about the phone records
from the motel?

28:39.094 --> 28:42.097
Fausto made one call
about an hour before he died.

28:42.097 --> 28:45.058
We ran it down to a
disposable mobile phone.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.102
So is there anything I can tell
the undersheriff?

28:47.102 --> 28:50.105
Yeah. Dead end on Fausto.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.607
You tell him.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.122
I got your results
from the blood on the bullet.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.625
It definitely belongs
to Officer Bell.

29:12.628 --> 29:15.631
This is my first
deceased police officer.

29:15.631 --> 29:17.090
I heard that his
wife is pregnant.

29:17.132 --> 29:20.594
Wendy, you understand
that this is confidential.

29:20.636 --> 29:24.139
Yes, sir. And you can't discuss
it, even with your coworkers.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.141
I understand what this means.

29:35.150 --> 29:38.153
Hey. Warrick tell you
about the IBIS hit?

29:38.654 --> 29:39.613
Yeah.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.157
How are you doing
with Bell's bullet?

29:42.157 --> 29:43.617
Just confirming my findings.

29:43.659 --> 29:45.911
Don't want to
make any mistakes.

29:45.911 --> 29:48.121
Does that mean
you have results?

29:48.163 --> 29:51.166
The bullet has the right GRC's
for a Sig-Sauer.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.168
Sergeant Adams
carries a Beretta.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.127
Carroll, too.

29:54.169 --> 29:56.630
Davis has a Glock, so
that rules them out.

29:56.672 --> 30:00.676
However, both detectives
Brass and Curtis carry Sigs.

30:02.678 --> 30:04.680
But take a look.

30:08.183 --> 30:10.686
There's hardly any jacket left.
Means there's almost

30:10.686 --> 30:13.188
no chance of identifying that
to a specific gun.

30:13.188 --> 30:15.440
What if you had more time?
Could you do it?

30:15.482 --> 30:17.818
Sorry, boss.
I mean, there's just no way

30:17.860 --> 30:20.195
I can tell you
who shot Officer Bell.

30:21.697 --> 30:23.157
You know, based
on the dates

30:23.198 --> 30:25.200
of these address labels,
it appears that Carlos

30:25.200 --> 30:26.660
and Bianca
were receiving

30:26.702 --> 30:28.704
two to three
drug shipments a day.

30:28.704 --> 30:31.165
So the dogs hit on the boxes?

30:31.206 --> 30:33.709
Yes, and Narco found
trace amounts of cocaine,

30:34.209 --> 30:37.212
for whatever that's worth.

30:37.713 --> 30:40.215
Well, the return
addresses are all bogus,

30:40.215 --> 30:41.216
the couple is not talking,

30:41.216 --> 30:42.718
and all four suspects

30:42.718 --> 30:44.678
are dead.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.221
There's nothing more we can do.

30:57.232 --> 30:59.234
Okay, Nick, the cruiser's
right front tire

30:59.234 --> 31:00.736
is 19 feet, five inches

31:00.777 --> 31:02.237
from the south curb.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.493
Sara, the detective unit's
left front tire

31:07.493 --> 31:09.745
is five feet, two inches
from the south curb.

31:14.249 --> 31:15.209
All right.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.002
Nick, you be Brass.

31:17.002 --> 31:18.754
Sara, you be Sofia.

31:18.754 --> 31:20.714
Good.

31:20.756 --> 31:22.216
I'll be Bell.

31:22.257 --> 31:26.261
Officer Bell was crouched down
behind his door.

31:35.771 --> 31:38.774
Griss, I can't see you
from here.

31:38.774 --> 31:41.276
You're blocked by both cars.

31:41.276 --> 31:42.736
Yeah, me either.

31:42.778 --> 31:44.279
I'd have to shoot
through both cars to get to you.

31:44.279 --> 31:47.282
I processed them both-
no shots

31:47.282 --> 31:48.784
entered from the back.

31:50.786 --> 31:52.287
Can you see me here?

31:54.790 --> 31:56.792
Yeah, I can see you.
Yeah, now.

31:58.794 --> 32:01.797
What would make Bell stand up
in the middle of a gunfight?

32:01.797 --> 32:04.758
Maybe he had
to change positions.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.802
We know that the suspects
were starting

32:06.802 --> 32:07.761
to run, right?

32:07.803 --> 32:10.806
Okay, he popped up,
took one in the vest.

32:12.307 --> 32:14.268
Let's assume that.

32:14.309 --> 32:16.311
We'll line up the exit
trajectories

32:16.311 --> 32:18.272
with the apartment window,

32:18.313 --> 32:20.315
and we'll use lasers,
but we may have to wait

32:20.315 --> 32:21.817
until it's dark.

32:25.821 --> 32:27.573
We're turning on the lasers.

32:27.573 --> 32:29.324
Is the candle in position?

32:29.324 --> 32:32.286
Ready on this end.

32:32.327 --> 32:34.329
Let me know when the beam
hits the candle.

32:34.329 --> 32:35.330
Good to go!

32:42.838 --> 32:44.798
Uh... good height.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.842
Move it six inches to the left.

32:46.842 --> 32:48.844
Six inches to the left.

32:51.346 --> 32:53.807
Uh, no, uh,myleft.

32:53.849 --> 32:54.850
He meant the other left.

33:00.355 --> 33:02.357
A little more...
little more...

33:04.359 --> 33:05.611
Right there.

33:05.611 --> 33:06.820
Perfect.

33:06.862 --> 33:08.363
I'll call you back.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.115
Okay, we got the exit.

33:10.157 --> 33:11.742
Now we need the entrance.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.368
Sara, turn your laser on.

33:18.874 --> 33:20.375
The path of my laser is off.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.877
Yeah, it's a bad angle.

33:21.919 --> 33:23.378
Move it to the left.

33:25.380 --> 33:29.384
Griss... it's
blocked by the car.

33:29.384 --> 33:30.886
It's not possible.

33:30.886 --> 33:33.347
Turn it off.

33:33.388 --> 33:34.848
Nick, turn yours on.

33:34.890 --> 33:37.893
Mine's been on the whole time.

33:37.893 --> 33:39.895
It's still blocked.

33:44.399 --> 33:45.400
Raise it up.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.424
He stood up.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.370
Hey.

34:38.411 --> 34:41.373
Well, your call was
a little cryptic.

34:41.415 --> 34:44.918
You must've got the results
from the ballistics test.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.880
We did, but it
was inconclusive,

34:47.920 --> 34:50.924
so I went back to the intersection
and ran a reconstruction.

34:50.966 --> 34:53.427
Boy, I don't know how you
reconstruct a war zone.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.429
You have no idea
what it was like.

34:55.469 --> 34:56.929
I mean, it was a fire fight.

34:58.932 --> 35:01.435
Have you talked to Sofia?

35:03.437 --> 35:05.939
It wasn't Sofia.

35:09.943 --> 35:11.904
You must have stood up...

35:11.945 --> 35:15.449
fired at the suspects
over the black and whites.

35:15.491 --> 35:17.451
Officer Bell stood
up at the same time,

35:17.493 --> 35:18.911
right into your
line of fire.

35:18.952 --> 35:22.456
Fausto shot him in the vest,
which spun him a little.

35:22.498 --> 35:25.459
At the same time, you
hit him in the neck.

35:27.461 --> 35:32.466
Oh, I-I swear,
I was behind the car, I...

35:32.508 --> 35:34.468
I- I stood up?

35:39.473 --> 35:42.476
Sheriff wants me to
present our findings

35:42.518 --> 35:44.478
at a community
meeting in an hour.

35:51.985 --> 35:53.987
Don't keep 'em waiting.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.962
I just received

36:10.003 --> 36:13.507
a report from the
Shooting Review Board.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.511
You've been cleared.

36:21.515 --> 36:24.518
You can go back to work.

36:27.521 --> 36:29.523
Thank you.

36:41.535 --> 36:44.538
Hello. My name is
Dr. Gil Grissom.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.498
I'm the night shift supervisor

36:46.540 --> 36:49.543
for the Las Vegas Police
Department's Crime Lab.

36:50.043 --> 36:52.546
I'm not a police officer;
I'm a scientist.

36:52.588 --> 36:55.048
You work for the cops.
That makes you a cop.

36:55.090 --> 36:56.049
You're not on our side.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.058
Actually,
I'm a forensics expert.

37:05.100 --> 37:08.020
My job is to identify,

37:08.061 --> 37:11.565
collect, and examine physical
evidence from a crime scene,

37:11.607 --> 37:15.068
to determine who did what to
whom and how did they do it.

37:15.110 --> 37:17.529
I've been asked to come here
today by the mayor

37:17.571 --> 37:22.075
and Sheriff Burdick to present
our analysis of the evidence

37:22.117 --> 37:23.535
in this case to your community.

37:23.577 --> 37:26.079
Why aren't they here? Why
should we believe your evidence?

37:29.082 --> 37:32.085
Physical evidence
cannot be wrong.

37:32.127 --> 37:33.545
It doesn't lie.

37:33.587 --> 37:37.549
It's not influenced by
emotion or prejudice.

37:37.591 --> 37:41.094
It's... it's not confused by
the excitement of the moment.

37:41.136 --> 37:44.389
I'm here, in God's house,

37:44.389 --> 37:47.559
to explain to you the truth

37:47.601 --> 37:51.605
about exactly what happened
the other day.

37:51.647 --> 37:55.609
I'd like to start by showing you
some photos.

37:55.651 --> 37:57.569
This is a bullet
that was recovered

37:57.611 --> 38:01.114
from the Kevlar vest
of Officer Daniel Bell,

38:01.156 --> 38:02.574
now deceased.

38:02.616 --> 38:04.076
What about my son?

38:04.117 --> 38:07.621
What-What does the evidence say
about my son?

38:10.624 --> 38:12.626
Okay, if you like,
we can start there.

38:12.668 --> 38:14.127
Please.

38:16.129 --> 38:19.383
This photo is a comparison
of two cartridge cases.

38:19.424 --> 38:22.636
The one on the right
was found next to your son.

38:22.678 --> 38:24.096
The one on the left

38:24.137 --> 38:28.600
was test-fired
from Jose Fausto's pistol.

38:28.642 --> 38:33.146
As you can see, there are
corresponding individual marks

38:33.188 --> 38:35.607
on both cartridges.

38:35.649 --> 38:38.110
These are unique,
like fingerprints.

38:38.152 --> 38:41.613
It means that they were
fired from the same gun.

38:41.655 --> 38:46.160
It proves that while attempting
to escape from the police...

38:46.201 --> 38:49.663
Jose Fausto shot your son
Geraldo in the back.

38:49.705 --> 38:51.665
Why would he do that?

38:53.167 --> 38:57.171
We recovered your son's bicycle
from Jose Fausto's motel room.

38:57.212 --> 39:00.174
Your son was on his way
to football practice.

39:03.677 --> 39:07.681
It appears that Jose Fausto
shot your son

39:07.723 --> 39:10.184
so he could use his bike.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.733
Jim, I was just
on my way out,

40:00.234 --> 40:01.735
but if you want
me to stay...

40:01.777 --> 40:03.237
No, I think
I can handle it.

40:03.278 --> 40:04.780
Yeah?
I think.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.240
Thanks.
Okay.

40:43.277 --> 40:46.280
I'll be right back.

40:53.787 --> 40:57.249
The Shooting Review Board
wants to talk to you.

40:57.291 --> 41:01.044
You're going to have to explain
your tactical decision

41:01.086 --> 41:04.798
for shooting in the direction
of a fellow officer.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.759
I'm ready
when they are.

41:07.801 --> 41:11.805
As far as I'm concerned,
there's no question...

41:11.847 --> 41:14.808
it was a bad shoot.

41:18.312 --> 41:20.314
I'll have to
live with that.

41:42.336 --> 41:43.837
Oh, whoa!

41:45.339 --> 41:48.300
Hey. What's your name?

41:48.342 --> 41:50.344
Gina.
Well, that's a pretty name.

41:52.846 --> 41:55.098
Is that your mom over there?

41:55.140 --> 41:57.351
Wow. Okay.
Be careful, Gina.

42:37.391 --> 42:40.394
Mrs. Bell... I'm Jim Brass.

42:40.435 --> 42:42.896
I know.

42:44.898 --> 42:47.901
I want you to know...
if there's, um...

42:47.943 --> 42:50.404
if there's any, um...

43:02.416 --> 43:05.419
I know it wasn't your fault.

43:09.423 --> 43:11.925
I... I'm...

43:11.967 --> 43:14.428
I'm so sorry.

43:15.305 --> 43:21.573
