WEBVTT

00:18.352 --> 00:21.355
-Thought about renting?
-I think this just makes more sense.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.610
-Milk?
-Got any soya?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.697
-No, we don't.
-Oh, okay.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.409
-Do you want me to start buying soya milk?
-No, it's all right.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.412
-I can make it.
-Oh, okay.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.457
So just some yellow organic soya beans
and some vanilla extract, please.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.669
And a small muslin cheesecloth.

00:57.099 --> 00:58.433
So, um...

01:00.936 --> 01:02.604
they give you a kid at this panel?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.399
-No.
-Oh, it's a shame.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.277
Yeah, no. They have to approve us
before we can start looking.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.030
-How long does it take?
-A while.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.451
So, you won't be needing
your spare room super soon then?

01:26.420 --> 01:29.381
Well, I told you. You shouldn't get
involved in other people's relationships.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.050
-Jason, I had no choice.
-You've gotta fight the urge, man.

01:32.134 --> 01:36.263
It's like if Attenborough sees an
elephant who's hurt or dying or whatever,

01:36.346 --> 01:38.182
he cannot intervene.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.559
No matter how much he wants to,
he's gotta leave it.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.603
-He doesn't leave it.
-Oh, yeah, he does.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.272
-No, I don't believe that. You're lying.
-I'm not.

01:45.355 --> 01:49.401
You're telling me that if he sees
an elephant and it's hurt,

01:49.484 --> 01:51.737
-he doesn't help it?
-No.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.158
-All right. What about a baby elephant?
-Definitely not.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.660
-He just ignores a baby elephant?
-He has to.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.120
-No. You're winding me up.
-I'm not.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.372
-A baby elephant?
-Yes.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.208
Well, that's really upset me.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.711
Oh, oi, oi. Have you done your panel prep?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.880
Yeah, yeah. More or less, yeah.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.132
Jase, I don't like having him here.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.552
-He's a bad influence on you.
-I'll do it later, all right?

02:15.636 --> 02:16.720
-Jason!
-Yeah?

02:16.803 --> 02:20.015
-Fi-Fi-Fi-Fi-Fifa!
-Bruv, I'm not being Chelsea.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.642
That's why I already put you in as Bolton.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.339
Lauren,
you have got that all over your face.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.091
-Can you pass me the...
-Yeah. This?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.468
Yeah. Thank you. Give this to you.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.137
-Did you give him that?
-No.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.431
Great,
so he's just picked that up off the--

03:01.515 --> 03:04.643
Fantastic,
my six-month-old is self-medicating.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.395
Here, darling. Here.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.610
-How's Freddy?
-Says he misses you.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.447
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.243
Right now I've only got the energy
to be a parent to two children,

03:21.326 --> 03:23.120
so he's gonna have to sort himself out.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.122
He wants to see the kids.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.168
-When?
-Weekends and two weekday nights.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.253
Okay.
So more than when he lived with us then?

03:32.921 --> 03:35.048
-Anyway, how are you?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

03:35.799 --> 03:39.303
Oh, say if no, but would I be able
to borrow your dress,

03:39.386 --> 03:41.180
the one that you bought
a couple of weeks ago?

03:41.263 --> 03:43.307
-Oh, yeah. Why?
-No, no reason.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.101
No, it's-- We've got the panel.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.729
-Oh, God, Nikki. I completely forgot.
-Oh, no, it's okay.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.981
Sorry, I just keep going on about--
Shit, sorry, yeah.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.650
No, of course you can.
How do you feel about it?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.320
Yeah, I mean,
it's basically just a job interview.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.156
But instead of a job, it's for everything
I've ever wanted, so yeah.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.658
Oh, look, fudge. Let me just-- Yeah.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.831
Okay. We ready?

04:08.874 --> 04:10.334
Yeah. I think so.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.547
You set an alarm
just in case we forgot the--

04:15.631 --> 04:17.716
-Just in case.
-Right. Right, okay.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.301
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.849
What? My phone could've died, couldn't it?

04:25.933 --> 04:26.975
Come on.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.398
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.593
Can we go through what we're gonna say?

05:02.553 --> 05:04.179
Okay, but I don't want it
to sound rehearsed.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.848
I just wanna make sure
that we're on the same page.

05:05.931 --> 05:06.890
All right.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.477
All right, I'm gonna try and connect
with Melanie.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.188
-All right.
-She's from child services.

05:13.272 --> 05:16.024
-She goes kayaking and she likes crafting.
-How'd you know that?

05:16.108 --> 05:19.736
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna tell her I make my own candles.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.780
It's crafting,
but it's not too on the nose.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.949
-But you don't make your own candles.
-See, Jason.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.618
This is one of the many things that
we need to be on the same page about.

05:26.702 --> 05:27.703
Right.

05:32.416 --> 05:33.417
What?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.420
-You have thought about your answers?
-Oh, yeah.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.172
It's just that I know you.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.757
And when you make mistakes,
you panic and you do your jokes.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.510
-Yeah, but I'm better if I'm loose.
-I want them to like you as much as I do.

05:43.594 --> 05:47.347
Hey. Don't worry about me,
all right? I'll be fine. Okay?

05:47.431 --> 05:48.432
Okay.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.644
Whatever happens, don't get angry,
'cause anger won't help.

05:52.728 --> 05:56.273
Right, okay. "Don't shout at the people."

05:56.356 --> 05:58.108
Right, I'll try and remember that, yeah.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.946
You're already here. How annoying.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.573
I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.242
The bus timetable is largely
a work of fiction at this point.

06:07.743 --> 06:11.205
Bloody stairs! At least we're not the
Benefit Office. They're on the top floor.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.873
No wonder they're all in tracksuits.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.376
No, I need the-- Right, can you read that?

06:17.794 --> 06:18.754
-No.
-No.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.964
Oh, don't-- No, it's okay. Okay.
It's probably fine. It's probably fine.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.050
Right, okay. Now, first thing,

06:23.133 --> 06:26.011
the Melanie woman
from child services isn't here,

06:26.094 --> 06:28.639
so we've got a Michael Grafton.

06:28.722 --> 06:33.727
And he is a local councillor
and chair of the finance subcommittee.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.396
-How terribly dull.
-Okay, why isn't she here?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.982
Maternity leave. Salt in the wounds,
I know, but there we go.

06:39.066 --> 06:43.070
Second thing. Do you have a-- Oh, crap.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.280
What's the thing? What is...

06:47.366 --> 06:49.868
-Social media presence?
-Why?

06:49.952 --> 06:53.622
Deep dive. They would shove a probe
up your bottom if they could.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.168
-All right?
-Yeah.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.884
-Did you delete everything?
-Yeah.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.511
-Your whole account?
-All of it, yeah.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.138
Gone dark. North Korea'd the lot.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.723
-Yeah.
-Oh, goodness.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.061
-All right?
-Got bit of a cramp actually.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.521
-Oh.
-Oh, yeah.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.898
-Jason, Nikki?
-Yes.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.108
-Would you like to come through?
-Oh, yes.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
Thank you, Your Honor.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.864
-It's okay. It's not a court.
-Okay. Sorry.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.115
It's okay.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.620
-Is it the door on the right? Okay.
-Yes, that's...

08:17.664 --> 08:19.374
Okay, so welcome.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.419
This is the panel review for Nikki Newman
and Jason Ross,

08:22.503 --> 08:25.464
who are seeking approval
as prospective adopters.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.550
So, I'm Sam. I'll be chairing today.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.677
And just to let you know
a little bit about me,

08:30.761 --> 08:34.014
I've spent around 13 years
working in social care,

08:34.097 --> 08:36.015
mainly with children in the care system.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.519
-Oh, well done.
-Oh, thank you.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.687
-Sorry.
-So before we begin,

08:40.770 --> 08:44.274
I'm just gonna let everyone introduce
themselves. So, can we? Yes.

08:44.358 --> 08:48.403
Hi, I'm Simon Davis. I work
in adolescent mental health services.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.655
-Hi, Simon.
-Hi, Simon.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.783
Julie Okolo, educational professional
and play therapist.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.201
-Hi, Julie.
-Hello, Julie.

08:54.284 --> 08:58.288
Another Julie. Julie Farnby.
I'm an adoptive parent of two.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.873
-Hi, Julie.
-Hello, another Julie.

08:59.957 --> 09:04.378
Michael Grafton, member of the council
and chairman of the finance subcommittee.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.921
-Hello, Michael.
-Hi, Michael.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.215
Nina Malik, lawyer in family court.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.341
-Hi, Nina.
-Hi, Nina.

09:09.424 --> 09:12.469
Jeanette Hale. My background
is in children and family social work.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.096
-Hi, Jeanette.
-Hi, Jeanette.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.432
Caoimhín Óg Ó hEachthighearna,
social worker in youth welfare.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.060
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.397
Okay, well, that's our hour.
Thanks for coming in.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.148
That went well. Did we--

09:27.734 --> 09:29.486
I should say that Nikki is very nervous.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.697
So I've assured her
you're all going to be lovely to her.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.241
It's all right,
I'm just imagining you all naked, so...

09:36.118 --> 09:38.495
Yeah. I enjoy a bit of that,
even when I'm not nervous.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.500
Okay, well, let's start
by summarizing the report.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.645
I think we'd really love it if you could
tell us a little bit about yourselves.

10:03.729 --> 10:04.730
-Yeah, um...
-Okay, great.

10:04.813 --> 10:08.692
Well, we've been together
for three blissfully happy years,

10:08.775 --> 10:09.985
two average ones.

10:12.613 --> 10:18.035
And in terms of hobbies,
we like TV, talking...

10:19.286 --> 10:21.413
seeing people that we like.

10:21.496 --> 10:25.834
You know, we're both white, obviously--

10:25.918 --> 10:27.211
I don't know what-- Yeah, go on.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.004
-We like keeping active.
-Yeah.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.882
-I do yoga. Jason's a keen runner.
-Yeah. I love running.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.259
-We're both really into our cooking.
-Oh, lovely.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.803
-Badminton. Both big badminton fans.
-What?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.473
Oh. Where do you play?

10:39.556 --> 10:42.518
Oh, anywhere. We just love the game.

10:42.601 --> 10:46.021
-It's addictive, isn't it?
-Yes. He has to drag me off the pitch.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.481
-Court.
-Court.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.735
We just both like generally
keeping ourselves busy.

10:53.946 --> 10:56.114
So, Jason...

10:58.200 --> 11:01.328
-you teach English to foreign students.
-I do, Michael, yes.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.705
-And how long you been doing that?
-Too long.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.124
-Oh, you don't like it?
-No, I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.211
-It can be frustrating at times, but--
-Do you get frustrated a lot?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.838
With younger people?

11:11.797 --> 11:14.508
-Oh, no. God, no. No, no, no, I don't.
-No.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.135
Okay.

11:18.428 --> 11:22.391
And, Nikki,
you work at a car rental firm. How's that?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.560
Oh, it's really great. I really love it.

11:24.643 --> 11:29.648
It's really satisfying matching people
to... cars. So, yeah.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.025
It's fair to say
that these are not highly paid jobs.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.443
-Well...
-Yeah, that's fair.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.528
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.573
-So, where does that leave you?
-Scruffy end of Camden.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.741
Nothing wrong with that.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.743
The last thing we need
is rich people's kids.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.705
That's why the country's in a mess,
isn't it? Rich people's kids.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.334
But if your child
needed extra care or tuition,

11:49.418 --> 11:54.173
or, I don't know, a disability ramp,
you could manage that?

11:54.715 --> 11:57.634
-Yeah. I think we'd cope.
-But it might be a struggle?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.682
Well, I've actually just taken a promotion
at work, to be a manager.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.184
So I'll be a lot more...

12:06.268 --> 12:08.937
managerial,
which will involve some extra cash.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.105
There you go.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.399
Ramps for everyone!

12:12.482 --> 12:13.942
And you're not married?

12:14.026 --> 12:17.487
No, no.
We've never really felt the need, have we?

12:17.571 --> 12:20.032
-No.
-There's not an issue with commitment?

12:20.115 --> 12:21.658
No, no issue with commitment.

12:21.742 --> 12:25.162
I think we just feel
that a bit of paper from the government

12:25.245 --> 12:26.747
doesn't prove anything.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.834
I mean, your one does.
We do need that, obviously.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.544
-We're totally committed.
-Yeah.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.047
We know a lot of married couples,

12:35.130 --> 12:37.424
and it's no guarantee
that a relationship will last.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.092
Exhibit A.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.859
Yeah, but no--
Obviously honesty is important.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.278
But it sort of goes into, again,

12:58.362 --> 13:00.572
what I was saying earlier
about communication, right?

13:00.656 --> 13:01.865
So if you've got like a...

13:03.325 --> 13:04.576
-What's those?
-Pyramid.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.037
Pyramid or tri-- Then communication
will be at the top, right?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.539
Then you've got honesty underneath there.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.375
But the communication sort of
encompasses both of them.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.919
So, if what you're--

13:14.002 --> 13:17.339
I've... been talking so long now,
I've forgotten what your question was.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.591
What do you think a child
would mean to you?

13:19.675 --> 13:21.218
Exactly, right. Okay.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.138
Communication. Below that,
honesty, and below that--

13:25.222 --> 13:26.890
-What would you-- Yeah, yeah.
-Sorry, Jase.

13:26.974 --> 13:32.437
I think that we started this process
thinking about what a child could give us,

13:32.521 --> 13:39.111
but now, honestly, we're just so excited
about what we can give a child.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.072
-Well said that, woman.
-Yeah, man.

13:43.448 --> 13:47.119
I want to ask about something
in the medical report.

13:47.578 --> 13:50.163
If it's about his smoking, he's quitting.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.916
-He's doing really well actually.
-I've not had one in ages now, Michael.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.835
Actually, it's your report.

13:55.711 --> 13:56.879
Oh, okay.

13:57.671 --> 14:01.216
So, I see you're taking Citalopram.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.343
Oh, okay. Yeah.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.222
And that's for?

14:08.140 --> 14:13.103
It's anxiety.
It's not the highest dose though.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.188
I see.

14:14.730 --> 14:18.192
And why do you think you have anxiety?

14:18.275 --> 14:19.526
Don't you watch the news?

14:20.194 --> 14:23.363
Well, it's hard to say.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.033
I don't know.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.828
And how do you think parenting
might affect it?

14:32.581 --> 14:36.001
Well, I think that everyone
has to work hard at being a parent

14:36.084 --> 14:38.921
irregardless of anxi--
regardless of anxiety.

14:39.004 --> 14:42.466
You started taking it around a year ago.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.427
Why was that?

14:51.141 --> 14:56.688
So, this was one round of IVF
and then you stopped.

14:56.772 --> 14:57.856
Is that correct?

14:58.482 --> 15:01.568
Well, we were told
it was very unlikely to work.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.862
And they only fund one round, don't they?

15:03.946 --> 15:06.156
So quite recently then
that you stopped trying?

15:06.240 --> 15:09.034
Well, no, not that recent.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.912
We tend to advise people
to wait a little longer.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.248
It just-- it really feels right now.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.707
It absolutely does, yeah.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.210
I think what my colleagues
are getting at is,

15:18.293 --> 15:21.380
adoption can't be seen
as a replacement for a birth child.

15:21.463 --> 15:25.050
-These kids are no one's plan B.
-Oh, no. Yeah, no. We know.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.386
People are reluctant
to put all their eggs in one basket

15:27.469 --> 15:30.180
and often try and pursue pregnancy
at the same time.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.099
She hasn't got any eggs.
I mean, that's why we're here.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.059
We're not even thinking about
getting pregnant now.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.353
Quite right. Why would you?
Awful business.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.855
Thirty-two hours, my first one.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.232
They had to prize that boy out of me
with a hot spoon.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.984
I said,
"Listen, you have got half an hour,

15:42.067 --> 15:44.736
and whatever's not out of me by then,
you can bloody well push back in."

15:44.820 --> 15:47.197
I think it's fair to say
that there are concerns here.

15:47.281 --> 15:51.034
In our experience, it takes time
to deal with a failure to conceive.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.453
We've all got something that
we're dealing with though, haven't we?

15:53.537 --> 15:54.997
I mean, God, no one's perfect.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.458
-But for you to be good adoptive parents--
-Sorry to interrupt you, Julie,

15:58.542 --> 16:00.878
but no one knows who's going to be
good parents, do they?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.129
I mean, look at...

16:03.172 --> 16:04.256
Hitler, right?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.800
Hitler's son
ran a medical supply business.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.094
He was a nice fellow, apparently.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.054
-And he had Hitler as a dad.
-Can you stop talking?

16:11.138 --> 16:15.893
I'm not comparing us to Hitler, obviously.
I'm just saying it's basically random.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.311
-Could you please stop?
-Okay.

16:19.438 --> 16:22.191
-We do have a responsi--
-Actually, I think it was his nephew...

16:22.691 --> 16:24.985
that did the medical-- Sorry, go on.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.738
We do have a responsibility
to the children and to you

16:27.821 --> 16:29.907
to make sure that you're in a position
that you can cope

16:29.990 --> 16:32.409
with what could be
a challenging situation.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.329
And for someone like yourself
with a history of anxiety and depression--

16:35.412 --> 16:37.623
I think you're making this
sound much worse than it actually is.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.876
My experience with mental health is
it's the ones who don't ask for help

16:40.959 --> 16:42.461
you got to worry about.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.756
They are the ones you see
in the post office in their pants

16:45.839 --> 16:47.591
trying to post their hair to Elton John.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.010
We know how hard a transition
this must be.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.513
You're bound to still be feeling
a degree of pain.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.890
Can people please stop telling me
how I feel?

16:54.973 --> 16:57.142
I know how I feel
because I'm the one feeling it.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.652
I am absolutely ready for this.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.570
And I can't prove it to you
because how could I?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.865
But I just-- I know.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.872
Sorry.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.795
-I actually just feel a bit sick.
-Would you like some water?

17:25.253 --> 17:26.296
Yeah.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.510
Okay, let's take a short break.
Shall we, yeah?

17:31.593 --> 17:33.011
-Yes.
-Sorry. Thanks.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.157
-You okay?
-Yep.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.412
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Just leave me.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.667
We're doing our job.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.170
Isn't this what we need?
Good, committed people?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.755
Look, concerns were raised.
It's due diligence.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.632
Bloody balls to that.
I've got kids who need homes.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.759
-Suitable homes.
-They are sui--

18:13.177 --> 18:14.219
They are suitable.

18:14.303 --> 18:17.097
Christ, if they're not suitable,
we may as well all pack up and go home.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.308
I've got kids in bloody war zones
out there.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.436
Kids half starved to death
two miles from where we are standing.

18:22.519 --> 18:26.231
Kids whose muscles are wasting away
because no one ever lifts them out of bed.

18:26.315 --> 18:28.859
And in this city, that is happening.

18:28.942 --> 18:32.321
Look, we're all aware
it's a challenging environment.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.780
I vouch for them.

18:33.864 --> 18:38.118
I've been doing this for 30 years,
and I am vouching for them.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.381
People really need to stop telling me
that I can't have children

18:51.465 --> 18:54.009
'cause it is seriously
just starting to piss me off.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.385
Okay. They are being beastly to you.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.387
And if it carries on,
I'm gonna climb over that table

18:57.471 --> 18:59.264
and hit them about the head
ever such a lot of times.

18:59.348 --> 19:04.895
I know I'm supposed to just take it,
but all I've had is doctors, consultants,

19:04.978 --> 19:09.024
and now local bloody councillors
looking over their glasses at me going,

19:09.107 --> 19:11.401
"Nope, not quite good enough. Sorry."

19:11.485 --> 19:13.946
Yeah, it's not fair. None of it is fair.

19:14.029 --> 19:18.075
I do feel over it.
I do feel ready. I want this.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.910
But then as soon as I want something,

19:19.993 --> 19:22.162
-I just--
-Okay, just listen to me.

19:22.246 --> 19:25.082
You are neither a dog with wheels
for back legs, nor married to my sister,

19:25.165 --> 19:26.542
so I have no pity for you.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.961
So, you pick yourself up
and slap on a smile,

19:29.044 --> 19:31.338
because it is not over until it is over.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.882
-Okay?
-Yeah.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.302
Right. Come on.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.146
It's all right.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.316
-Hitler?
-Badminton?

19:51.692 --> 19:52.818
Thank you.

19:58.824 --> 20:02.828
So, Julie, I think you wanted
to pursue this idea of loss.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.789
I'm sorry. Can we stop, plea--
Objection. I have an objection.

20:05.873 --> 20:08.458
-Again, not a court.
-Okay, sorry. I just--

20:08.542 --> 20:11.503
Before we carry on,
there's just something I have to say.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.755
-I can't let you talk about her like this.
-Jase.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.382
-No, it's fine.
-No, I'm sorry, I can't.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.803
I cannot. Because if they knew you,
they would not speak to you like this.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.350
-Do you know how amazing she is?
-Jason.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.856
Do you know how much of a better person
I am since I met her?

20:33.692 --> 20:35.861
It's not even like
she really does anything.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.613
It's just being near her.

20:39.072 --> 20:43.243
You sort of get cured in it, like bacon.

20:43.744 --> 20:44.786
Seriously.

20:44.870 --> 20:49.291
Okay, so,
a while ago we hired a car, right?

20:49.374 --> 20:52.878
And she cleaned it before she gave it back

20:52.961 --> 20:56.548
because she wanted it to be nice
for the next people.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.426
I mean, who does that?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.305
Who cleans a rental car?

21:08.185 --> 21:11.063
So for you to say
that we're not the kind of people

21:11.146 --> 21:14.149
who should be doing this because of
what we've been through, that's not true.

21:14.816 --> 21:15.984
Because...

21:17.653 --> 21:19.488
we keep hearing
that these children's journeys

21:19.571 --> 21:22.658
have started with trauma... and loss.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.117
Well, so did ours.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.708
So we are the kind of people
that you need because...

21:35.712 --> 21:37.130
we know pain.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.925
'Cause we've been through it.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.554
And we know the way out.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.353
That's it.

21:55.732 --> 21:59.069
Okay. Shall we move
to the home study report?

22:22.801 --> 22:25.679
You know I cleaned that car 'cause
I borrowed it from work without asking?

22:26.263 --> 22:28.682
Oh, shit.
I better go and tell them then, hey?

22:28.765 --> 22:30.309
Oh, stop it.

22:36.815 --> 22:37.900
I'm really sorry.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.527
What do you mean? For what?

22:41.904 --> 22:44.406
For everything,
for all the trouble I cause you.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.490
What are you talking about?

22:46.200 --> 22:49.036
Well, if you were with someone else,
you wouldn't be having to do this,

22:49.119 --> 22:51.121
-would you?
-Don't wanna be with someone else.

22:51.205 --> 22:53.165
-Yeah.
-I wanna be with you.

22:53.248 --> 22:56.418
Say that now 'cause you're with me
and you love me.

22:56.502 --> 22:57.753
But if you were with someone else,

22:57.836 --> 23:00.172
you'd love them
and that love would be easier.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.383
Nikki.

23:05.260 --> 23:08.096
I feel sorry for anyone
not going out with you.

23:11.975 --> 23:12.976
Honestly.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.939
I don't know how they get up
in the morning.

23:26.657 --> 23:28.825
I'm not saying that they won't approve us,

23:28.909 --> 23:32.746
but, you know, I almost burst into tears
and you compared us to Hitler, so...

23:35.207 --> 23:39.878
I just want you to know that,
if this doesn't happen...

23:42.548 --> 23:43.757
you're enough.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.847
Okay.

23:52.307 --> 23:55.143
So, they want you to do some counseling

23:55.227 --> 23:59.022
just because it's not been long
since you stopped trying, but...

24:00.732 --> 24:01.733
But?

24:02.901 --> 24:04.027
You've been approved.

24:13.287 --> 24:15.205
-We're getting a baby.
-Yeah.

24:16.540 --> 24:19.001
-I mean, at some point.
-Not now.

24:19.084 --> 24:22.254
-No, and not a baby necessarily.
-Not necessarily a baby, but, I mean...

24:41.523 --> 24:42.608
Sorry.

24:52.284 --> 24:53.827
Yay!

24:55.704 --> 24:56.914
So, what happens now then?

24:56.997 --> 24:59.458
Well, now is the fun part.
Now we meet some kids.

25:00.501 --> 25:02.669
-Just ideally not--
-Not a Chelsea fan.

25:02.753 --> 25:04.171
I know that's a redline for you.

25:04.254 --> 25:05.714
That's a bit more of a blue line,
isn't it?

25:13.639 --> 25:14.848
That's a nice jumper.

25:16.517 --> 25:17.559
Thank you.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.062
I just tell it like it is.

25:21.980 --> 25:26.568
-You much of a football man yourself, Vic?
-No, not really. I watch it on the telly.

25:26.652 --> 25:27.986
Do you know how to play golf?

25:28.070 --> 25:29.363
-Oh, golf. No.
-Karen.

25:30.906 --> 25:32.533
-Karen, hello!
-Hey.

25:35.077 --> 25:36.119
-I'm really sorry.
-I'm really sorry.

25:36.203 --> 25:38.539
-I don't know why I said that.
-I know you don't like him. I've chosen--

25:47.756 --> 25:52.261
Oh, my God. Karen, that's huge.
That must have cost a fortune.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.221
Yeah. That's what Scott said.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.892
Come on. What are you having then?

26:02.479 --> 26:05.399
So you just swipe right if you like him,
like that.

26:05.482 --> 26:08.569
Okay. Oh, this is a game changer for me.

26:08.652 --> 26:12.155
Yeah. I was single last weekend.
It was tough.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.659
-How long has it been for you?
-I had a bloke a while back,

26:15.742 --> 26:18.787
but the dog took against him
and he's right more times than he's not.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.498
-Oh, he's nice.
-Do you want to have a go?

26:21.582 --> 26:22.916
-What do you mean?
-Just swipe right.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.002
-Shall I? Okay.
-Yeah, do it. Right.

26:25.085 --> 26:26.461
Ooh, I like him too.

26:26.545 --> 26:27.921
-Get me another one.
-Okay.

26:28.005 --> 26:29.047
Just get me another one.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.384
I know he's not Brad Pitt, but...

26:32.467 --> 26:35.429
You know, you start off dreaming
of this perfect love

26:35.512 --> 26:38.682
that's gonna lift you up and make
your heart beat and your head hurt.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.017
And then...

26:41.226 --> 26:44.104
you end up just wanting someone
to go to lunch with.

26:45.856 --> 26:47.065
It's compromise.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.694
And at this stage, it's either him,

26:50.777 --> 26:53.822
a handsome racist
or someone amazing in a coma.

26:57.326 --> 26:59.203
I didn't realize you were so lonely.

26:59.286 --> 27:01.413
I used to send you texts at 2:00 a.m.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.707
Yeah. I thought
you were just being annoying, Karen.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.250
Yeah, well, that too.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.793
Mate.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.922
Stuff can still be good, you know?

27:12.090 --> 27:13.800
Even when it's not planned.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.184
Yeah.

27:39.284 --> 27:40.744
So, you're a manager now?

27:40.827 --> 27:43.372
-Yeah.
-When were you gonna tell me that?

27:43.455 --> 27:46.041
I should probably tell someone
at work first, to be fair.

27:48.836 --> 27:52.714
We have to grow up now.
For real. No excuses.

27:52.798 --> 27:55.425
-We'll have to start saving.
-And get a pension.

27:55.509 --> 27:56.635
And eat pâté.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.513
And read proper books,
not ones from supermarkets.

27:59.596 --> 28:02.432
And I'm gonna tell my dad to stop
sending me money on my birthday.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.809
All right? I'm gonna do it.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.896
Oh, we should get place mats
and special cutlery.

28:08.397 --> 28:10.941
-And guest towels.
-And an ironing board.

28:11.984 --> 28:13.527
-And an iron.
-And an iron.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.697
You know,
we should probably knock through.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.198
God, yeah. Definitely knock through.

28:18.282 --> 28:20.534
An excellent way
to maximize space in your property.

28:21.285 --> 28:23.036
And we're going to need the extra space.
