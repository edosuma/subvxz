00:02.115 --> 00:03.726
<i>Previously, on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:04.216 --> 00:05.543
What's going on Jai?

00:05.613 --> 00:08.013
Come with me.
I'll drive.

00:10.791 --> 00:12.709
My son was assassinated!

00:12.793 --> 00:15.712
You want to search someone's
hands for Jai's blood?

00:15.796 --> 00:17.363
Search yours.

00:17.414 --> 00:18.614
I'm sorry for your loss,
Henry.

00:18.666 --> 00:21.000
No, you're not.

00:21.051 --> 00:22.702
I know this is macabre,

00:22.753 --> 00:25.171
but I wanted to see this place
for myself.

00:25.222 --> 00:27.173
I knew you were
the right person for this.

00:27.224 --> 00:28.641
Whatever it is you'd like me
to do,

00:28.709 --> 00:30.643
I won't go against
Joan and Arthur.

00:30.711 --> 00:32.712
Take a look.

00:32.762 --> 00:35.014
There are things that I need
to say to you--

00:35.065 --> 00:36.382
important things.

00:36.433 --> 00:37.550
Come home.

00:37.601 --> 00:39.719
Please.
Eyal needs my help,

00:39.770 --> 00:41.187
and I can't do nothing.

00:41.238 --> 00:43.656
You once told me you didn't
have feelings for him.

00:43.724 --> 00:45.992
Is that not true?
Is that what's driving this?

00:46.059 --> 00:47.610
Why do you keep asking
me that?

00:47.695 --> 00:48.995
Well, there's a conversation

00:49.062 --> 00:51.164
I've been hoping to have
with you for a while now,

00:51.231 --> 00:53.282
but I've never found
the right time to have it.

00:53.367 --> 00:55.234
What do you want
to talk about?

00:58.255 --> 01:01.407
I need you, Annie.

01:01.458 --> 01:04.794
I never need anyone...

01:04.878 --> 01:06.179
but I need you.

01:06.246 --> 01:08.681
You and I both know
this isn't our song.

01:08.749 --> 01:11.351
We'll dance again, Walker,
but not 'till the music's right.

01:31.739 --> 01:32.789
Annie.

01:32.873 --> 01:35.208
You don't have to do this.

01:35.275 --> 01:36.659
I'm sorry, Auggie.

01:36.744 --> 01:38.961
This is Henry Wilcox's fault,
not yours.

01:40.330 --> 01:43.499
I should have never read you
in that morning in bed.

01:43.584 --> 01:45.585
I should have just said,
"I love you."

01:45.636 --> 01:47.970
I love you, too.
Come home.

01:48.055 --> 01:50.173
- I can't.
- Annie--

01:50.257 --> 01:51.924
It's too late
for heart to hearts.

01:51.975 --> 01:53.559
No, Annie--

01:53.627 --> 01:55.561
Good-bye, Auggie.

01:57.648 --> 01:59.599
Annie!

02:00.768 --> 02:03.803
Annie!

03:03.714 --> 03:09.635
So...that happened.

03:12.205 --> 03:14.140
I want to be completely honest
with you.

03:14.207 --> 03:15.808
Mm.

03:15.876 --> 03:19.044
Right before you came here
last night,

03:19.096 --> 03:22.181
I had a meeting
with Henry Wilcox.

03:22.232 --> 03:23.649
Did not see that coming.

03:23.717 --> 03:25.384
He gave me a file.

03:25.435 --> 03:26.519
What was in it?

03:26.570 --> 03:29.405
Serious intel on Arthur.

03:29.490 --> 03:32.191
Financial records that indicate
he may be funneling money

03:32.242 --> 03:35.227
to the ALC terror group
in Colombia?

03:35.279 --> 03:36.579
Henry also showed me pictures

03:36.663 --> 03:40.399
of Arthur meeting with
a woman in D.C.

03:40.450 --> 03:43.286
He has evidence of the same
woman meeting with

03:43.370 --> 03:46.906
the ALC terrorist codenamed
"The Puma."

03:51.845 --> 03:54.079
Look carefully
at the last page.

03:56.266 --> 03:58.851
That's one
of Auggie's aliases.

04:02.356 --> 04:04.357
Did he tell you
I opened the account?

04:04.424 --> 04:06.392
He did.

04:06.443 --> 04:08.394
It doesn't look good.

04:10.030 --> 04:12.281
Why are you telling me this?

04:12.366 --> 04:16.067
Jai liked you
and trusted you.

04:16.119 --> 04:18.204
I want to spare you from
the bloodletting

04:18.271 --> 04:19.605
about to hit Langley.

04:19.656 --> 04:22.241
Do you expect me
to believe any of this?

04:22.292 --> 04:24.610
I expect you to observe.

04:24.661 --> 04:26.295
Dominoes will start to fall.

04:26.380 --> 04:29.415
Tomorrow the D.O. will begin
a routine investigation

04:29.466 --> 04:32.251
into Auggie Anderson's
security clearance.

04:32.302 --> 04:35.304
Within a week,
Arthur will resign.

04:35.389 --> 04:37.590
In a few months, this thing
will blow wide open,

04:37.641 --> 04:41.126
and everyone involved
will be brought down.

04:41.178 --> 04:45.932
I'm sorry to say, this won't end
well for your friend Auggie.

04:45.983 --> 04:47.149
Bullshit.

04:47.234 --> 04:49.986
Henry is grasping
at some random detail

04:50.070 --> 04:52.471
from a long ago case
to wedge between us.

04:52.522 --> 04:53.806
I can go to Colombia.

04:53.857 --> 04:55.491
I'll follow the money
after it leaves the bank

04:55.576 --> 04:56.609
and prove Henry wrong.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.077
Yeah, and then what?

04:58.144 --> 05:00.345
Henry finds the next wedge,
the next task for you to do.

05:00.414 --> 05:01.914
Before you know it,
you're his pawn.

05:01.982 --> 05:03.222
He didn't ask me
to do anything.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.284
That's a red flag right there.

05:07.537 --> 05:11.156
I can handle it.
Don't worry.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.264
Nice distraction.

05:18.331 --> 05:20.466
- You caught that, did you?
- Mm-hmm.

05:20.517 --> 05:22.001
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

05:22.052 --> 05:24.437
You slept with me even after
you heard all about this file?

05:24.504 --> 05:26.555
You made a strong case.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.108
I did, didn't I?

05:29.175 --> 05:30.776
Mm, we're gonna be late
for work.

05:30.844 --> 05:32.445
Uhhuh.

05:32.512 --> 05:35.398
Mmm.

05:42.739 --> 05:46.075
Morning.

05:46.159 --> 05:48.327
Morning, Walker.

05:48.378 --> 05:49.862
How was your evening?

05:49.913 --> 05:52.865
I didn't get much sleep.
I just tossed and turned.

05:52.916 --> 05:56.052
Interesting.
Me too.

05:56.136 --> 05:58.037
Anderson.
We're here from the D.O.

05:58.088 --> 05:59.505
to requisition
all your hard drives.

05:59.556 --> 06:01.057
We need you to sign off.
Why?

06:01.141 --> 06:02.708
Standard security back check.

06:02.759 --> 06:04.760
Your security clearance
will be dropped to a seven

06:04.845 --> 06:05.978
until we filter the data.

06:06.046 --> 06:07.980
It should take a couple of days
at most.

06:08.048 --> 06:09.515
You answered "what,"
not "why."

06:09.566 --> 06:11.517
Well, I don't get paid enough
for "why."

06:11.568 --> 06:14.570
Sign here, please.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.078
- So, I'm going to Colombia.
- Annie--

06:22.162 --> 06:23.228
They requisitioned
your hard drive

06:23.280 --> 06:24.914
and downgraded
your security clearance?

06:24.998 --> 06:26.248
Henry called it.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.533
We can't talk about this here.

06:27.534 --> 06:31.037
Have you seen
our Berlin Wall memorial?

06:34.041 --> 06:36.876
I'm going on the record, Annie.
This is not the right move.

06:36.927 --> 06:39.929
We have to vet Henry's intel
to prove him wrong.

06:40.013 --> 06:42.264
I can go to Medellin,
talk to someone at the bank,

06:42.349 --> 06:43.799
see who has access
to the accounts,

06:43.884 --> 06:45.801
follow the money before
it's too late.

06:45.886 --> 06:48.554
Henry said Arthur would
step down within the week.

06:48.605 --> 06:50.973
If you believe Henry,
which I don't.

06:51.058 --> 06:52.975
A hard drive rec is nothing new
for a tech op.

06:53.060 --> 06:54.777
I can't take that chance.

06:54.861 --> 06:56.529
I need you, Auggie.

06:56.596 --> 06:58.564
You have me.

06:58.615 --> 07:00.566
It's going to be fine.

07:02.953 --> 07:04.620
Then we have to go
to Arthur or Joan.

07:04.705 --> 07:07.573
No, because if the allegations
against Arthur are true,

07:07.624 --> 07:10.109
we'd only be tipping him off.
And the same goes for Joan.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.711
You can't have it both ways.

07:11.778 --> 07:13.462
You can't say it's nothing
and then say it's something.

07:13.547 --> 07:15.464
All I'm saying is
we need to give this time

07:15.549 --> 07:16.665
to sort itself out.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.417
With you in jail?
Or worse?

07:18.468 --> 07:21.003
Annie, this is what
Henry Wilcox does.

07:21.088 --> 07:23.672
He thrives on chaos.
He wants us to panic,

07:23.757 --> 07:26.125
to react, so he can find
a vulnerability.

07:26.176 --> 07:29.261
Our best option is to not
give him the satisfaction.

07:30.764 --> 07:32.231
Are you nodding?
Tell me you're nodding.

07:32.298 --> 07:34.400
Yes.

08:06.633 --> 08:08.134
Hey, Barber.

08:08.185 --> 08:09.185
Uh, Eric.

08:09.269 --> 08:10.335
Hey, Annie.

08:10.387 --> 08:11.554
Could you give this note
to Auggie

08:11.638 --> 08:13.338
when he gets out of
the DST briefing?

08:13.390 --> 08:15.474
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

08:15.525 --> 08:18.611
No problem.
Do you eat lun--

08:21.865 --> 08:23.399
Auggie.
- Yeah?

08:23.483 --> 08:25.568
Annie left a note for you.
I didn't read it.

08:27.237 --> 08:29.354
Let me guess.
She's going to the bank.

08:29.406 --> 08:30.487
Yeah, that is what it says.

08:30.523 --> 08:33.626
How did you know tha--
I-I did read it.

08:33.693 --> 08:36.528
I'm sorry.

09:05.006 --> 09:08.006

09:48.285 --> 09:50.069
- Mr. Sanchez?
<i>- Si?</i>

09:50.120 --> 09:52.437
I had a question about
a foreign currency account.

09:52.489 --> 09:54.373
There are tellers inside
who can help you.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.825
I was told you were the man
to speak to at Banco Medellin.

09:56.910 --> 09:59.328
And why is that?

09:59.412 --> 10:01.280
You're not afraid
to take chances.

10:01.331 --> 10:03.165
I need you to give me
information

10:03.250 --> 10:04.750
about a high-value client.

10:04.801 --> 10:08.170
And why would I do that?

10:08.255 --> 10:10.956
This for your girlfriend,
Beatriz.

10:11.007 --> 10:13.759
Or you could give it
to your wife, Claudia.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.895
Or you can give it
to your other girlfriend,

10:15.962 --> 10:17.563
also called Claudia.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.464
I know all about you, Oswaldo.

10:19.516 --> 10:22.134
The fancy cars,
and the massive debt.

10:22.185 --> 10:24.136
So if you want to talk,
we need to talk.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.492
Okay, let's talk.

10:30.577 --> 10:32.811
But not here.

10:32.862 --> 10:35.197
Here's the account number.

10:35.282 --> 10:37.917
Where do you want to meet?

10:37.984 --> 10:40.536
Orquideorama.
5:00 sharp.

10:44.708 --> 10:47.259
Personally,
I'd give it to your wife.

10:55.218 --> 10:56.302
Hello?

10:56.353 --> 10:59.772
- She picks up.
- Auggie, I'm sorry.

10:59.839 --> 11:01.807
I had to do this.
I had too good an in to pass up,

11:01.858 --> 11:04.693
the assistant bank manager.
Oh, you wouldn't be you

11:04.778 --> 11:06.195
if you didn't follow it down.

11:06.279 --> 11:07.529
Although I'm surprised
you didn't stake out the bank

11:07.614 --> 11:09.148
to see who's picking up
the cash.

11:09.199 --> 11:11.016
Yeah, too many moving parts.

11:11.067 --> 11:14.069
The bank manager proved to be
as irreputable as expected.

11:14.154 --> 11:16.205
I'm meeting him later
for the full download.

11:16.289 --> 11:18.523
Your instincts,
spot on as always.

11:18.575 --> 11:20.692
- You're not mad?
- Mad, no.

11:20.744 --> 11:23.996
I am here, though.

11:24.047 --> 11:25.998
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

11:36.309 --> 11:39.595
Do you remember that first
weekend we went away together?

11:39.679 --> 11:40.712
Secretly.

11:40.764 --> 11:42.648
Chesapeake.
How could I forget?

11:42.715 --> 11:44.266
I claimed to be going
to a conference,

11:44.351 --> 11:46.385
and you asked for vacation time.

11:46.436 --> 11:47.736
- Mm-hmm.
- Why do you ask?

11:47.821 --> 11:50.572
Annie and Auggie
just pulled the same move.

11:50.657 --> 11:52.391
I think they're dating.

11:52.442 --> 11:54.410
Well, we thought
it might happen.

11:54.494 --> 11:56.278
Think we should force
their hand on filing

11:56.363 --> 11:57.613
a close and continuing?

11:57.697 --> 11:58.831
Oh, not yet.

11:58.898 --> 12:01.834
Remember how long we waited,
after all?

12:01.901 --> 12:05.454
We should go back to
the Chesapeake this weekend.

12:05.538 --> 12:06.672
I'd like that.

12:06.739 --> 12:07.956
Where'd they go?

12:08.041 --> 12:10.125
Colombia.

12:10.210 --> 12:11.593
Not exactly the Chesapeake.

12:11.678 --> 12:13.595
Hmm.

12:28.945 --> 12:31.763
This place wasn't even built
the last time I was here.

12:31.815 --> 12:34.867
Your mission for Arthur.
How long were you here?

12:34.934 --> 12:36.334
I was on the ground
less than a day.

12:36.403 --> 12:37.653
In and out.

12:37.737 --> 12:40.039
I didn't even really look around
to see the sights.

12:40.106 --> 12:42.157
Did you spend any time
with the guy

12:42.242 --> 12:44.076
you opened the account for?
Eh, an hour.

12:44.127 --> 12:46.412
He was a nice enough guy.
We talked about soccer.

12:46.463 --> 12:49.164
You see our banker?

12:49.249 --> 12:51.116
Fashionably late.

12:51.167 --> 12:53.252
- Thoughts?
- We wait.

12:55.455 --> 12:57.256
We dance.

12:57.307 --> 12:58.557
I like it.

13:03.096 --> 13:05.130
It's a great spy craft
case study--

13:05.181 --> 13:07.182
to wait or not.
To trust or not.

13:07.267 --> 13:08.901
That feels leading.

13:08.968 --> 13:11.904
We need to be as honest
as we can.

13:11.971 --> 13:14.073
It's the only way to make
this relationship work.

13:16.476 --> 13:20.446
Honestly, I don't care
if this guy never shows up.

13:20.497 --> 13:22.448
Hold that thought.

13:38.548 --> 13:42.434
Hmm, I don't see him.
You don't see him,

13:42.502 --> 13:44.622
or you don't see him and
it's setting off alarm bells?

13:44.670 --> 13:46.605
I don't see him.

13:50.226 --> 13:51.343
Auggie, he's dead.

13:51.394 --> 13:54.029
Annie, movement
at my five o'clock.

14:03.022 --> 14:05.457
I strongly suggest
you two come with me.

14:22.292 --> 14:23.532
Okay.

14:23.843 --> 14:25.478
Everything on the table.

14:25.479 --> 14:26.780
Okay.
My name is Calder Michaels,

14:26.847 --> 14:30.116
and I'm the station chief here
in Medellin.

14:30.184 --> 14:32.736
I now have a sweep team
at the orchard garden,

14:32.820 --> 14:35.071
and three bribes
I'm going to have to make

14:35.156 --> 14:37.624
because of those bodies, but
here I am doing all the talking

14:37.691 --> 14:40.627
when two other CIA operatives
are visiting my lovely city.

14:40.694 --> 14:42.412
How rude.
Go.

14:42.496 --> 14:45.332
You must be mistaken.
We're just here on vacation.

14:47.701 --> 14:50.036
- Okay.
- Okay?

14:52.206 --> 14:53.973
I've had eyes on you
ever since

14:54.041 --> 14:56.509
you stepped off the plane
in Cordova.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.346
But if this is the way
you want to play it...

14:59.397 --> 15:02.065
Langley doesn't always alert
local station chiefs

15:02.149 --> 15:05.068
about missions in-country.

15:05.152 --> 15:08.188
When was the last time you
were on a mission in Colombia?

15:10.074 --> 15:13.827
Exactly.
Never.

15:13.894 --> 15:15.862
'Cause it's not just dangerous
down here, it's unpredictable.

15:15.913 --> 15:18.415
There's a code, but it's messy.
There are laws, but not really.

15:18.499 --> 15:19.999
But the one thing
you can count on

15:20.067 --> 15:23.119
is that operatives do better
in Colombia when I'm looped in.

15:23.204 --> 15:25.839
So, you're like the sheriff
of this here town?

15:25.906 --> 15:29.926
I'm not like the sheriff.
I am the sheriff.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.545
I'm the youngest station chief
in South America in 20 years,

15:32.596 --> 15:34.437
and I got here because
I know how to play ball.

15:34.515 --> 15:37.083
But that's hard to do
by yourself.

15:37.134 --> 15:38.852
I think,
it's called "juggling."

15:42.940 --> 15:45.141
I'd like to propose a toast.

15:45.226 --> 15:47.477
To us.

15:47.561 --> 15:52.365
Are we going to become
friends...

15:52.433 --> 15:53.599
Enemies,

15:53.651 --> 15:55.268
or just remain people who happen

15:55.319 --> 15:57.654
to be spies for the same
great country?

15:57.738 --> 15:59.539
It's really up to you.

15:59.606 --> 16:00.606
Cheers.

16:00.658 --> 16:02.608
Cheers.

16:09.467 --> 16:12.001
Well...

16:12.086 --> 16:14.003
Enjoy your visit.

16:16.474 --> 16:18.425
This one's on me.

16:25.132 --> 16:26.453
You think he's gonna
call Langley?

16:26.467 --> 16:29.469
A guy that ambitious
won't risk pissing off HQ.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.803
Doesn't want to take the chance

16:30.855 --> 16:32.572
we're working above
his clearance level.

16:32.639 --> 16:34.640
Well, now we have him
to worry about.

16:34.692 --> 16:36.642
Well, at least he paid
for the drinks.

17:03.837 --> 17:05.972
What's the status
on Walker and Anderson?

17:06.022 --> 17:08.525
Okay.

17:08.608 --> 17:09.726
Okay, good.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.844
Keep me posted.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.846
Thanks.

17:36.754 --> 17:38.471
Hey.
Hi.

17:38.539 --> 17:40.006
I just got a call
from the hill.

17:40.057 --> 17:42.041
Lots of paperwork and some
meetings they need me for.

17:42.092 --> 17:44.978
It's just--it's gonna be
a long night.

17:45.045 --> 17:48.714
And we're going to have
to postpone the Chesapeake.

17:48.766 --> 17:51.884
I'm sorry.
We'll do dinner tomorrow night.

17:51.936 --> 17:54.387
Date night.
Sure.

17:54.438 --> 17:55.855
See you tonight, late.

17:55.906 --> 17:57.824
Okay.
Good night.

18:03.163 --> 18:04.364
Hmm.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.067
Good news and good news.

18:08.118 --> 18:09.536
Which do you want first?

18:09.587 --> 18:11.538
- Uh, good news?
- The good news is,

18:11.589 --> 18:16.742
your blood panel came back.
No health issues.

18:16.794 --> 18:19.912
Great.
So, what's the other good news?

18:19.964 --> 18:24.934
The blood tests
also showed beta HCG.

18:25.019 --> 18:26.919
You're pregnant, Joan.

18:26.971 --> 18:28.921
Congratulations.

18:34.761 --> 18:36.896
The bank opens
in five minutes.

18:36.947 --> 18:38.898
How will we know
if the transfer goes through?

18:38.949 --> 18:41.234
I was able to put an e-trace
on the account,

18:41.285 --> 18:43.403
but get comfortable.
It could take a while.

18:43.454 --> 18:45.938
If it happens.
And if it does,

18:45.990 --> 18:48.774
you think following the courier
is the best idea?

18:48.826 --> 18:51.578
Unfortunately,
I think it's the only idea.

18:58.502 --> 19:02.755
What's a five-letter word
for "monarchs"?

19:02.806 --> 19:05.174
Easy.
<i>Reyes.</i>

19:06.293 --> 19:07.810
Hey, the money's in.

19:07.895 --> 19:09.012
Finally.

19:09.096 --> 19:12.682
I don't think I could handle
the jumble.

19:20.474 --> 19:21.908
How do I sound?

19:21.975 --> 19:24.077
I don't know.
Say something dirty.

19:55.809 --> 19:57.843
Jackpot.

19:57.895 --> 20:00.063
That's our account, Annie.
That's the courier.

20:37.234 --> 20:38.551
He's on the move.

20:38.602 --> 20:40.687
And so are we.

21:19.276 --> 21:22.311
Gun!

21:22.396 --> 21:23.730
Can you go after him?
I'll meet you back.

21:23.781 --> 21:25.698
- You're shot!
- It's just a graze.

21:25.766 --> 21:27.099
You're bleeding!

21:32.039 --> 21:33.740
Come here.
Come here.

21:35.159 --> 21:37.210
- You're going to be fine.
- I told you that.

21:37.277 --> 21:40.630
Where's my cane?

21:40.714 --> 21:42.498
Here.

21:42.583 --> 21:43.666
"It's just a graze"?

21:43.751 --> 21:45.084
Who says that?

21:45.135 --> 21:48.671
Tough guys.
Tough guys say that.

21:54.178 --> 21:55.394
What's going on?

21:57.347 --> 21:58.598
Nothing good.

22:19.657 --> 22:20.690
Where are we?

22:20.741 --> 22:21.741
It's some kind of restaurant.

22:21.826 --> 22:23.743
Could be an ALC meeting place.

22:23.828 --> 22:26.062
Step, step.

23:01.399 --> 23:03.984
You're blind?

23:04.068 --> 23:07.103
No, she can see just fine.

23:10.074 --> 23:15.211
So...a little tip
from a local.

23:15.279 --> 23:19.382
You should be careful
who you follow around here.

23:26.974 --> 23:29.009
Come on.
Come on.

23:31.178 --> 23:33.629
Just sit there.

23:33.681 --> 23:36.066
Okay.

23:36.133 --> 23:38.852
Let's see.

23:45.809 --> 23:47.861
In America, you're soft.

23:47.945 --> 23:53.249
You just need painkillers
for everything.

23:53.317 --> 23:55.502
Even the truth.

23:55.586 --> 24:01.041
Here, we have no such luxuries.

24:01.125 --> 24:04.511
No illusions.

24:09.266 --> 24:11.051
Open your mouth.

24:11.135 --> 24:13.636
Open your mouth.

24:13.687 --> 24:15.805
Good.

24:15.856 --> 24:19.976
Let's see.
Let me see.

24:24.348 --> 24:25.732
Stop!

24:29.737 --> 24:32.155
Yeah.

24:37.194 --> 24:39.129
Good.

24:45.702 --> 24:50.140
What were you doing trying
to access my accounts?

24:50.207 --> 24:51.257
You're the Puma?

24:51.342 --> 24:53.376
I didn't come up
with the name.

24:53.427 --> 24:56.980
Frankly, we could have
done better.

24:57.047 --> 24:59.482
My friends call me Teo.

24:59.550 --> 25:01.985
Teo Braga.
Whatever you're thinking,

25:02.052 --> 25:05.355
Teo, we're on the same side.

25:07.108 --> 25:11.361
We have a friend in common,
in America.

25:11.412 --> 25:13.780
I have no American friends,

25:13.864 --> 25:17.733
and I suggest you two

25:17.785 --> 25:20.787
leave Colombia, now.

25:34.185 --> 25:35.185
Here.

25:35.252 --> 25:37.470
Directions back to Botero Plaza.

25:37.555 --> 25:40.056
You don't want to get lost
in Medellin, right?

25:40.107 --> 25:42.592
Unh.

25:42.643 --> 25:43.977
Get out.

25:45.362 --> 25:47.763
Is that the guy
you made the account for?

25:47.815 --> 25:49.199
Yes, and no.

25:49.266 --> 25:52.768
The voice is an exact match.
No doubt about it.

25:52.820 --> 25:54.654
What do you mean?

25:54.738 --> 25:58.074
I mean, the guy that I met
was vibrant and hopeful,

25:58.125 --> 26:01.161
and this guy is crazy
and dead inside.

26:05.249 --> 26:07.167
Maybe not completely dead.

26:10.838 --> 26:12.758
You know, even though
we didn't get to steal away

26:12.789 --> 26:15.141
to the Chesapeake, I'm still
glad we had this time tonight.

26:15.226 --> 26:17.677
Me too.

26:17.761 --> 26:21.731
So, um, here's something.

26:21.798 --> 26:24.434
What? Who is it?
I have to take this.

26:24.485 --> 26:26.686
Quickly.

26:26.770 --> 26:28.238
Hello?

26:37.481 --> 26:40.083
This is from the gentleman
at the bar.

26:53.013 --> 26:56.015
Hello, Henry.

26:58.552 --> 27:02.772
Not a call, not an email,
not a kind word, Joanie.

27:04.341 --> 27:06.175
I thought you could use a drink.

27:06.227 --> 27:07.677
Why's that?

27:07.728 --> 27:10.063
Today is Jai's birthday.

27:10.147 --> 27:12.232
Or it would have been.

27:12.316 --> 27:15.568
How quickly we forget,

27:15.653 --> 27:18.738
move on, adapt.

27:18.822 --> 27:22.825
Well, I don't forget.

27:22.876 --> 27:24.377
I am truly sorry, Henry.

27:24.461 --> 27:26.079
I know you are, Joan.

27:26.163 --> 27:28.798
I always knew
you were the good one.

27:32.386 --> 27:34.304
Enjoy that drink.

27:34.371 --> 27:38.308
It's a Mai Tai,
made with Colombian rum.

27:51.355 --> 27:54.407
These stitches are gonna be
pretty janky.

27:54.491 --> 27:59.061
You'll probably have a scar.
Oh, scars are sexy.

27:59.113 --> 28:00.780
Depends on how you get them.

28:05.619 --> 28:07.086
Annie, you know,
there's a version of this

28:07.171 --> 28:10.256
where we don't go to the meet.
You saw that guy.

28:10.341 --> 28:13.459
He is a wild card
beyond a wild card.

28:15.746 --> 28:18.464
I want to make sure
that you're protected.

28:20.017 --> 28:22.185
Yeah, see, that's a problem
right there.

28:22.252 --> 28:24.270
I don't want you to have to
do this for me.

28:26.890 --> 28:28.691
Having someone
take care of you

28:28.759 --> 28:30.810
wouldn't be the worst thing.

28:32.029 --> 28:33.946
It wouldn't?

28:39.620 --> 28:41.771
There's another person
you're doing this for.

28:41.822 --> 28:44.574
Who's that?

28:44.625 --> 28:46.909
You.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.079
I know that deep down,

28:50.130 --> 28:54.584
the idea of going toe-to-toe
with Henry Wilcox

28:54.635 --> 28:58.454
and outwitting him,
beating him at his own game,

28:58.505 --> 29:01.624
gets you fired up.

29:01.675 --> 29:03.760
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's hot.

29:07.064 --> 29:08.348
But it's true.

29:08.432 --> 29:11.984
It's probably a little bit true.

29:12.069 --> 29:15.605
Well, that's not reason enough
to stay.

29:15.656 --> 29:17.357
We have everything we need.

29:17.441 --> 29:20.360
There's no point playing
Henry's game anymore.

29:20.444 --> 29:22.745
Hey, please...

29:22.813 --> 29:26.315
Trust me on this.

29:26.367 --> 29:28.284
Let's go home.

29:32.673 --> 29:34.657
Okay, let's go home.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.297
So, you're leaving my town without
even a friendly goodbye?

29:53.298 --> 29:54.381
What, you didn't get our

29:54.465 --> 29:56.350
edible arrangements
thank you basket?

29:56.868 --> 29:58.402
No, I didn't.

29:58.453 --> 29:59.987
A drink first?

30:00.071 --> 30:01.705
Didn't we already grab
a drink?

30:01.773 --> 30:03.490
It's Colombia.

30:03.575 --> 30:05.492
There's always another drink.

30:19.674 --> 30:22.142
Oh, I, uh--I forgot something
in my room.

30:22.227 --> 30:24.461
I'll be back really quickly.

30:27.265 --> 30:29.400
So you buying this time?

30:33.989 --> 30:37.024
I'll take a rum.
Goes down quicker.

30:48.169 --> 30:50.838
What happened to your shoulder?
What, this?

30:50.922 --> 30:53.340
Shaving accident.

30:53.425 --> 30:54.991
You should see the other guy.

30:55.043 --> 30:57.011
There was another guy?

30:59.297 --> 31:03.166
You know, we really got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

31:03.218 --> 31:05.636
You don't know me.
Oh, sure I do.

31:05.687 --> 31:08.338
You're Calder Michaels,
the Wyatt Earp of Medellin.

31:10.275 --> 31:11.892
You could say that.

31:11.976 --> 31:13.343
You could also say

31:13.395 --> 31:16.196
that nobody in the Agency wanted
to work Colombia anymore.

31:16.281 --> 31:18.232
The action's in Islamabad
or Peshawar.

31:18.316 --> 31:20.317
But I went after this post.

31:20.368 --> 31:22.152
I saw it for
the opportunity it was.

31:22.203 --> 31:23.787
I knew it was gonna be messy.

31:23.855 --> 31:26.824
It's definitely messy.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.459
What I'm trying to say is

31:28.526 --> 31:32.079
that I'm the kind of guy
that can help you.

31:32.163 --> 31:34.665
All right, I'll be back
at Langley soon enough.

31:34.716 --> 31:36.884
My career plan is four years
ahead of schedule.

31:36.968 --> 31:40.504
You'll be retiring early
as well?

31:40.555 --> 31:42.306
Spoken like a guy
who hasn't gotten

31:42.373 --> 31:45.208
a promotion in 3 1/2 years.

31:45.260 --> 31:48.345
That's right.
I looked you up.

31:48.396 --> 31:51.098
You know, for a guy trying
to get off on the right foot,

31:51.182 --> 31:53.233
this isn't the best start.

31:53.318 --> 31:55.602
Have we started?

31:57.689 --> 31:59.189
<i>Uno mas.</i>

32:02.243 --> 32:04.828
Is that Henry Wilcox?

32:04.896 --> 32:06.029
It was.

32:06.081 --> 32:08.832
And we just had
the strangest conversation.

32:12.253 --> 32:14.738
What did he want?

32:14.789 --> 32:16.924
He was upset about Jai.

32:17.008 --> 32:19.009
Today would have been
his birthday.

32:22.547 --> 32:24.298
Doesn't it strike you as odd
that he just

32:24.382 --> 32:26.583
happened to be here,
drowning his sorrows,

32:26.634 --> 32:28.418
at our neighborhood restaurant?

32:28.470 --> 32:31.555
Well, Henry doesn't
do anything without a purpose.

32:31.606 --> 32:34.057
What exactly did he say?

32:34.109 --> 32:36.226
Not much.

32:36.277 --> 32:39.363
He sent over this Mai Tai
made with Colombian rum.

32:40.648 --> 32:42.599
What do you think that's about?

32:47.104 --> 32:50.040
So, Annie--she single?

32:50.107 --> 32:54.461
Well, we don't really
talk about that kind of stuff.

32:54.546 --> 32:56.580
But I should probably
go check on her

32:56.631 --> 32:58.298
and make sure she's okay.

32:58.383 --> 33:00.300
Yeah, because you're
just co-workers.

33:11.146 --> 33:13.296
So, what do we need
to discuss?

33:13.348 --> 33:14.464
Where's your friend?

33:25.810 --> 33:28.445
- Annie.
- What's going on?

33:28.496 --> 33:29.976
You've got to take me there
right now.

33:29.998 --> 33:32.950
- What's going on?
- Right now!

33:33.001 --> 33:34.618
Let's go!
Here, come on.

33:34.669 --> 33:37.788
Here, go!

33:41.042 --> 33:42.209
You tell Arthur Campbell

33:42.293 --> 33:44.545
that the blood's on his hands,
not mine.

33:44.629 --> 33:46.830
- Whose blood?
- He made promises to me.

33:46.881 --> 33:49.132
He said he'd be there for me.
But you know what?

33:49.184 --> 33:50.584
You tell him that
I'm done with him.

33:50.635 --> 33:53.336
I burned the account,
so I don't need him anymore.

33:53.388 --> 33:54.628
How do you know
Arthur Campbell?

33:54.639 --> 33:55.839
That's what I need to know!

33:55.890 --> 33:57.558
- Didn't your friend tell you?
- Tell me what?

33:57.642 --> 33:59.977
A day ago, I didn't know you,

34:00.028 --> 34:02.062
and today I'm getting shot at.

34:02.146 --> 34:06.066
Seems like you and I both
don't have the full truth.

34:17.245 --> 34:19.413
- Do you see her?
- No.

34:21.197 --> 34:23.467
Annie!

34:23.534 --> 34:25.636
Auggie.

34:25.703 --> 34:27.304
- You okay?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

34:27.371 --> 34:29.706
- Ahh, okay.
- I'm okay.

34:29.757 --> 34:32.259
Okay.

34:32.342 --> 34:34.177
Okay.

34:36.598 --> 34:37.648
Listen up.

34:37.715 --> 34:39.315
Either the ALC
or the Colombian police

34:39.382 --> 34:40.516
will be here within seconds.

34:40.568 --> 34:43.719
Whatever your game is down here
is now over.

34:43.771 --> 34:46.188
Come with me.

35:20.542 --> 35:23.003
Why couldn't this wait?
The situation has changed.

35:23.028 --> 35:25.028
There's too many eyes on us.

35:26.061 --> 35:27.877
We need to end this.

35:27.878 --> 35:30.412
End it?

35:30.464 --> 35:32.414
Are you kidding?

35:35.919 --> 35:37.419
You asshole.

35:37.471 --> 35:39.522
We talked about the fact
this moment was coming.

35:39.589 --> 35:41.891
No, you talked about it.

35:41.942 --> 35:45.811
I never accepted it.
I still don't.

35:45.896 --> 35:48.030
Well, you're gonna have to.

35:48.097 --> 35:50.032
I'm sorry.

35:52.035 --> 35:55.037
Have you thought about this?

35:55.104 --> 35:56.905
Have you really thought
about what this means,

35:56.907 --> 35:58.824
to cut someone loose?

36:00.494 --> 36:03.796
You of all people
should know that I have.

36:05.715 --> 36:08.283
So what happens now?

36:08.335 --> 36:12.004
Nothing happens now.

36:12.088 --> 36:14.006
It's done.

36:21.765 --> 36:25.133
So, that drink
we had before...

36:25.185 --> 36:27.686
was our farewell drink
after all.

36:27.771 --> 36:29.271
I guess so.

36:29.322 --> 36:30.906
You know, the only nice thing
about you two

36:30.974 --> 36:33.242
doing this mission off-book,

36:33.309 --> 36:35.361
is that I don't have to
file any paperwork.

36:35.445 --> 36:38.330
- What mission?
- Exactly.

36:38.415 --> 36:40.666
Let's hope when we meet again,

36:40.750 --> 36:44.870
we do a little better job
communicating, because this--

36:44.955 --> 36:48.457
whatever this was--
it was a mess.

36:54.214 --> 36:56.015
For a guy claiming to be
the sheriff,

36:56.099 --> 36:58.434
he didn't exactly
roll out the welcome wagon.

37:00.470 --> 37:02.354
Come on, cowboy.

37:02.439 --> 37:05.224
We've got a plane to catch.

37:15.318 --> 37:18.621
I'm sorry I left you alone
in the bar to deal with Calder.

37:20.624 --> 37:21.707
I should have trusted
your instincts.

37:21.791 --> 37:24.793
I just wanted to know
what Teo wanted.

37:24.861 --> 37:27.830
To know more.

37:27.881 --> 37:29.832
I'm glad you're okay.

37:37.974 --> 37:39.892
There's something
you should know.

37:42.062 --> 37:45.397
That guy--
the man you met, Teo.

37:47.601 --> 37:49.551
He's Arthur's son.

37:51.488 --> 37:52.988
Arthur has a son?

37:53.056 --> 37:55.407
He was stationed in Cartagena
when he was in the Navy.

37:56.860 --> 38:00.613
When he asked me to set up
his account all those years ago,

38:00.697 --> 38:03.666
he said it was highest priority
for his son.

38:03.733 --> 38:05.951
You knew this all the time?

38:06.036 --> 38:08.671
I wasn't sure
until I heard his voice.

38:08.738 --> 38:11.757
Annie, I wanted to protect you
from all of this.

38:11.841 --> 38:14.760
Arthur swore me to secrecy.
No, II get it.

38:14.844 --> 38:18.714
I mean, I've kept secrets, too.
It's part of the job.

38:18.765 --> 38:20.415
Well, that makes
this strange conversation

38:20.467 --> 38:22.351
a little less strange.

38:22.418 --> 38:24.136
A little.

38:24.220 --> 38:25.721
Does Joan know?

38:25.772 --> 38:29.975
I...I don't know.
My guess is no.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.477
We have to tell them all this.

38:31.561 --> 38:36.031
About Henry, and the trip...
and about us.

38:36.099 --> 38:38.901
I agree.

38:38.952 --> 38:42.154
Anyway,
I'm glad you told me.

38:42.238 --> 38:44.156
Heart to hearts require talk.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.188
It's unusual for employees
to demand to see his superior.

39:05.042 --> 39:07.928
A lot of things happening
these days are unusual.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.214
Yeah, like you going down
to Colombia without telling me.

39:11.215 --> 39:13.751
I needed to protect Annie.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.721
How'd that work out?

39:19.225 --> 39:21.476
You told her Teo was my son?

39:21.543 --> 39:23.344
She would have figured it out
on her own.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.846
And she's going to figure out
the rest.

39:24.897 --> 39:26.814
I need to read Annie in
on all of it.

39:26.882 --> 39:28.016
You can't.

39:28.067 --> 39:30.051
You know that.

39:30.102 --> 39:34.221
Arthur, Teo is lost to you.
It's over.

39:34.273 --> 39:36.357
I talked to him,
and I'm sorry to say this,

39:36.408 --> 39:38.359
but he is gone.

39:40.162 --> 39:42.580
Well, if that is true,

39:42.665 --> 39:45.500
then you should know
the ramifications of talking.

39:45.567 --> 39:46.668
I don't care.

39:46.735 --> 39:49.671
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

39:51.406 --> 39:54.709
You love her, don't you?

39:54.760 --> 39:56.711
Yeah, I do.

39:56.762 --> 40:00.181
Then let's not forget that
you're keeping secrets, too.

40:09.725 --> 40:11.893
Ready to do this?

40:11.944 --> 40:14.762
Yeah.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.065
Auggie, are you okay?
Are you sure?

40:18.534 --> 40:20.434
Yeah, I'm sure.

40:20.486 --> 40:23.204
Let's do it.

40:31.914 --> 40:33.948
Barber?
What's going on?

40:33.999 --> 40:35.750
DCS just called everyone
to the bubble

40:35.801 --> 40:37.118
for an all-hands meeting.

40:37.169 --> 40:39.120
It sounds big.
I don't know.

40:41.173 --> 40:44.726
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've gathered you all here today

40:44.793 --> 40:49.847
because you deserve to hear
directly from me.

40:49.932 --> 40:52.650
In the coming days,
press outlets will reveal...

40:55.637 --> 40:58.523
that I have engaged
in an extramarital affair.

41:00.776 --> 41:02.610
Is Joan up there with him?

41:02.661 --> 41:04.078
- So as not to distract...
- No.

41:04.146 --> 41:06.531
From the important work
of this Agency,

41:06.615 --> 41:10.284
I am resigning my post,
effective immediately.

41:11.837 --> 41:15.640
I want to thank each and every
one of you for your service.

41:18.258 --> 41:20.265
I couldn't have hoped
to work with a finer,

41:20.826 --> 41:22.822
more patriotic group
of men and women.

41:25.904 --> 41:27.383
It has been my honor.

41:35.417 --> 41:37.100
This changes everything.
