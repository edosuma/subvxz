00:02.102 --> 00:04.593
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.434
I can't decide which
list item to do today-

00:09.542 --> 00:11.567
pushed Slow Roger down a hill
in the porta-potty...

00:11.678 --> 00:14.169
or got the babysitter pregnant.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.239
- Hey.
- Here's an idea. Here's a crazy idea.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.842
How about for once
we do what I wanna do?

00:20.954 --> 00:24.754
<i>And I might not know what that is right now,</i>
<i>but I know what it's not-</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.258
doing another item
on your stupid list!

00:27.360 --> 00:29.294
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Maybe it was my imagination...</i>

00:29.396 --> 00:32.627
<i>but Randy seemed kind of stressed out</i>
<i>this morning, and he wasn't the only one.</i>

00:32.732 --> 00:35.326
How the hell you gonna sit with a straight face
and tell me that MacGyver...

00:35.435 --> 00:37.630
wouldn't be the most awesome
president of the United States of America ever?

00:37.737 --> 00:39.602
He's a fictional character, Joy.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.608
No. Fictional characters are in books, Darnell.
MacGyver's on TV.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.803
I'm not gonna argue about this.

00:45.912 --> 00:48.039
"I'm not gonna argue about this."
I hate when you say that.

00:48.148 --> 00:51.049
It makes it sound like you think you could win
the argument if you wanted to...

00:51.151 --> 00:53.210
but I'm too stupid to argue with.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.219
Argue with me!

00:55.321 --> 00:57.619
<i>[Earl Narrating] For some reason,</i>
<i>tensions were higher than normal.</i>

00:57.724 --> 01:02.058
<i>Even laid-back Catalina</i>
<i>had her G-string in a bunch.</i>

01:03.563 --> 01:05.531
That's it.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.268
Go ahead.
Take a squeeze so I can eat in peace.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.270
Take a squeeze!

01:12.372 --> 01:14.567
<i>[Earl Narrating] Yep. Something</i>
<i>was definitely in the air that morning.</i>

01:14.674 --> 01:17.438
Randy, give me my list back.

01:17.544 --> 01:20.308
Why don't you come and get it?

01:20.413 --> 01:23.177
<i>[Earl Narrating] Maybe it was a coincidence</i>
<i>that people were acting odd.</i>

01:23.283 --> 01:25.808
<i>Or maybe it was like how</i>
<i>animals get freaked out...</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:28.615
<i>right before an earthquake</i>
<i>or a tsunami or-</i>

01:28.721 --> 01:30.780
Oh, my God!
It's a giant swirly wind thingy.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.790
<i>Or as they call it on the news-</i>

01:32.892 --> 01:34.985
Tornado!

01:35.095 --> 01:38.258
<i>The tornado ditch was</i>
<i>the trailer park version of a storm shelter.</i>

01:38.364 --> 01:40.389
<i>And in Camden, it got a lot of use.</i>

01:40.500 --> 01:42.559
Remember, if we get separated...

01:42.669 --> 01:45.035
we all meet back
where the trailer used to be.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.106
[Man]
I got it!

01:47.207 --> 01:49.141
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>After the tornado passed...</i>

01:49.242 --> 01:51.710
<i>it became clear</i>
<i>why we called it "nature's game show."</i>

01:51.811 --> 01:53.904
<i>Anything on the ground</i>
<i>is finders, keepers.</i>

01:54.013 --> 01:57.380
- [Joy] Kids, remember. Shiny before heavy.
- [Man] I got it!

01:57.484 --> 01:59.452
That's mine right there.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.085
Earl, look! Steaks!

02:07.193 --> 02:09.161
Finders, keepers.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.355
Just keep an eye out for my list.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.571
<i>[Randy]</i>
<i>Earl! Earl! Earl!</i>

02:18.671 --> 02:20.798
I got a boat.
This is awesome!

02:20.907 --> 02:23.398
Now we can live
just like <i>The Love Boat.</i>

02:23.510 --> 02:28.311
<i>You wanna be Isaac,</i>
<i>Julie or that pervy doctor?</i>

02:28.414 --> 02:31.713
Wait. I take that back.
I wanna be the pervy doctor.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.378
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Catalina hadn't lived in Camden that long...</i>

02:34.487 --> 02:36.546
<i>so she wasn't used to tornadoes...</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:38.681
<i>or the finders, keepers rule.</i>

02:40.360 --> 02:43.818
- Finders, keepers.
- But that's my purse.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.023
It's imitation imitation Gucci.

02:46.132 --> 02:49.226
Well, it's mine now.
That's the rules.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.667
You don't see me bitchin'
about losing my diaphragm.

02:51.771 --> 02:55.002
- [Sniffs]
- Hey, that's my shoe.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.406
- This isn't fair.
- Fair?

02:57.510 --> 03:01.173
I got 1500 on my S.A.T.'s.
Life ain't fair.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.943
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Catalina didn't like having her stuff stolen...</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:07.076
<i>but she was about to learn the meaning</i>
<i>of that old American saying...</i>

03:07.187 --> 03:09.678
<i>"Don't get mad. Get even."</i>

03:11.491 --> 03:13.391
Everybody freeze!

03:14.494 --> 03:16.485
I am sick of being walked on.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.793
I am walked on as an immigrant.
I am walked on as a maid.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.833
I am walked on as a stripper.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.803
Literally! There's a guy who comes in
on Wednesdays who's into that sort of thing.

03:25.905 --> 03:30.239
So give me back my purse
and my shoe.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.578
And, Patty, I like that watch.

03:34.681 --> 03:38.082
You know what?
Give me everything.

03:38.184 --> 03:42.120
You heard her, folks.
Gun rules trump tornado rules.

03:44.324 --> 03:48.124
Darnell, look. A Bible.
I wonder if this is some kind of sign.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.220
Doubtful.
Natural disasters are stressful times...

03:51.331 --> 03:54.425
in which people ascribe heightened meaning
to random events of physics.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.298
I think a Bible
just got blown onto the steps.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.668
Yeah. Okay. And I guess Adam and Eve
just got blown into the Garden of Apples.

04:00.773 --> 04:02.741
Things happen for a reason, Darnell.

04:02.842 --> 04:07.006
- I'm not gonna argue about this.
- There you- Damn it.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.206
Stop treating me like I'm stupid.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.951
I'm not treating you
like you're stupid, baby.

04:14.053 --> 04:17.113
It's just that you have very strong opinions
that you don't seem to wanna change...

04:17.223 --> 04:21.853
and I don't wanna spend all day arguing
with the most beautiful girl in the trailer park.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.986
Don't you talk down to me.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.463
I know when I'm
being comprehended to.

04:26.566 --> 04:29.433
- You think you're smarter than me.
- I <i>am</i> smarter than you.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.696
[Gasps]

04:31.804 --> 04:34.534
But that doesn't make me better.

04:34.641 --> 04:38.099
Y-You're stronger and you know all the words
to "Total Eclipse of the Heart."

04:38.211 --> 04:40.179
Not to mention that statistically...

04:40.280 --> 04:43.374
you're at a lower risk for heart disease,
so kudos for that, huh?

04:43.483 --> 04:45.542
[Sizzling]

04:45.652 --> 04:48.280
Well, it's gone.
The list is gone.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.357
Great. Now I gotta
rewrite the whole thing.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.687
I think these steaks
came pre-marinated.

04:53.793 --> 04:57.320
I swear this one smells like wine or whiskey
or some kind of alcohol.

04:57.430 --> 05:01.389
I don't think I want those steaks, Randy.
They don't belong to us.

05:01.501 --> 05:04.061
None of this stuff belongs to us.

05:04.170 --> 05:07.162
I bet someone's really missing
those steaks right now.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.831
And that boat.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.967
Yeah. Those people would
be the losers, weepers.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.205
What's the matter with you, Earl?
You love finders, keepers.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.910
During the last tornado,
you got that cool blue door for the El Camino.

05:22.455 --> 05:26.221
You know what?
I bet that's why I lost my list.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.729
Karma did it- so I'd realize
what losing something feels like.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.424
I gotta add that blue door
to my new list.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.663
- What's this?
- We're gonna find out who's smarter.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.672
I can beat you at any game we own.
Pick one. Uno. Jacks. Twister.

05:41.774 --> 05:45.266
- Those aren't about intellect.
- Fine.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.277
Operation. That's a game
made by doctors.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.585
Oh, no. Here comes another one.

05:53.686 --> 05:58.020
Boys, get in here and tie yourselves
to your mother! We're going back to the ditch!

05:58.124 --> 05:59.853
Go! Get!

05:59.959 --> 06:02.723
<i>[Earl Narrating] Catalina was about</i>
<i>to change the way the world treated her.</i>

06:02.829 --> 06:05.195
- <i>But instead, something changed her.</i>
- [Gasps]

06:07.200 --> 06:10.636
A Bible.
<i>! Dios mï¿½o!</i>

06:10.737 --> 06:15.265
<i>Another tornado has been sighted</i>
<i>here in Camden...</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:17.400
and it looks like
there's more to come.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.876
[Screaming]

06:19.979 --> 06:21.446
Was that my daughter?

06:25.785 --> 06:30.222
Randy, they said there's another one coming!
You gotta get inside!

06:30.323 --> 06:34.851
No can do, Earl!
A captain always goes down with the ship!

06:34.961 --> 06:37.759
Fine. Suit yourself!
But don't come crying to me when-

06:37.864 --> 06:40.958
[Screaming]

06:41.067 --> 06:42.659
Randy!

06:45.338 --> 06:49.274
Randy!
Oh, my God! Randy!

06:49.375 --> 06:52.401
My brother got sucked up
into the tornado.

06:52.512 --> 06:56.710
Quick. Everybody drag your mattresses
into the parking lot.

06:59.018 --> 07:00.986
Whoo!

07:01.087 --> 07:05.023
- Whoo-hoo!
- <i>[Earl] Randy!</i>

07:05.124 --> 07:07.649
You're not dead.
Thank God.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.228
- I'm so sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

07:10.329 --> 07:15.062
I've never felt more alive.
I rode a tornado! I was flying!

07:15.168 --> 07:17.500
And you should see
all this stuff up here...

07:17.603 --> 07:21.471
like a toaster, tennis racket...

07:21.574 --> 07:24.168
skateboard.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.507
A gun.

07:27.914 --> 07:31.111
Damn it, Randy.
What have I told you about throwing guns?

07:31.217 --> 07:33.151
Oh, right.
Not to do it.

07:33.252 --> 07:36.779
Hey, there's a half
a kitty cat up here.

07:36.889 --> 07:40.347
Wow. You wouldn't believe
what they put inside a kitty cat.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.157
<i>It's, like, really gross soup</i>
<i>and snakes.</i>

07:44.263 --> 07:46.629
[Retching]

07:49.168 --> 07:53.070
- Check it out. We got a boat.
- Oh, you are so smart.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.072
Is that what that is, a boat?

07:55.174 --> 07:57.540
I didn't know that.
I thought it was a herd of lions.

07:57.643 --> 08:01.044
Actually, a group of lions
is called a pride.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.172
I knew that.
It's in <i>The Lion King.</i>

08:03.282 --> 08:04.749
Shut up!

08:04.851 --> 08:07.081
So you know
a bunch of stuff that's in a cartoon.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.086
I'm the kind of smart
that people care about...

08:09.188 --> 08:11.349
the kind that matters on the street.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.721
- What kind is that?
- Street smart, dumb-ass...

08:13.826 --> 08:15.817
which clearly you're not
or you'd have known that.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.260
"Street smart" is just
something dumb people say...

08:18.364 --> 08:20.889
when they wanna use the word "smart"
to describe themselves.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.026
Dumb people, huh?

08:24.136 --> 08:27.697
Okay, Mr. Genius, let's see how brilliant you are
when you don't have a place to sleep tonight...

08:27.807 --> 08:29.968
because you won't be
in the trailer...

08:30.076 --> 08:33.068
and I was smart enough to get my name
on the deed and you weren't.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.147
That's not smart.
You just married Earl...

08:35.248 --> 08:38.240
and had him sign it over to you
when he was whacked out on morphine.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.615
That's right.
Street smart.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.280
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Everybody got their stuff back from Catalina.</i>

08:43.389 --> 08:46.916
<i>She didn't care. She was in the middle</i>
<i>of a religious experience.</i>

08:47.026 --> 08:49.119
God slapped a gun out of my hand.

08:49.228 --> 08:51.560
He knew I had evil in my heart.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.690
I know I say this
all the time to get bigger tips...

08:54.800 --> 08:57.928
but I truly have been
a very bad girl.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.632
<i>And she wasn't the only one</i>
<i>feeling guilty.</i>

09:01.741 --> 09:03.834
I know the Bible hit you...

09:03.943 --> 09:06.935
but there's a decent chance
he was aiming at me.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.379
I once got pregnant
with the devil's baby.

09:10.483 --> 09:14.442
The devil's the mascot
at the local junior college, but still.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.853
It was so cool when I was flying.

09:17.957 --> 09:23.020
The only thing I'd change is next time
I'd bring a couple tiny bags of peanuts with me.

09:23.129 --> 09:27.293
You didn't fly, Randy.
You got thrown up on the roof by a tornado.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.368
You're a naysayer...

09:29.468 --> 09:32.301
just like all those people that said
that Orville Redenbacher couldn't fly.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.272
<i>[Reporter] Another tornado</i>
<i>has just ripped through Nathanville...</i>

09:35.374 --> 09:37.467
and has been spotted
heading towards Camden.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.274
Time to ride the sky, Earl.
Time to ride the sky!

09:41.380 --> 09:42.847
Randy!

09:44.483 --> 09:46.610
Yes, Dodge,
it was very smart of me...

09:46.719 --> 09:51.179
to make these silver-dollar pancakes
with a lighter and a spoon, heroin-style.

09:51.290 --> 09:55.226
Man, Mama made teeny pancakes...

09:55.328 --> 09:58.422
and all I did was use the boat's motor
to charge the battery...

09:58.531 --> 10:00.965
so I could hook up a TV, VCR...

10:01.067 --> 10:04.696
for some SpongeBob videos
and this Sno-Kone machine.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.329
Got our favorite flavor- blue.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.533
- [Both Laughing]
- Oh, look.

10:09.642 --> 10:13.100
<i>I guess you love me too much</i>
<i>to run to your father.</i>

10:13.212 --> 10:15.305
- Baby, look what we're doing.
- [Grunts]

10:15.414 --> 10:19.043
I'm pimpin' out a fishing boat. You turned
the boys into some kind of love yo-yos.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.381
This doesn't seem
like good parenting.

10:21.487 --> 10:24.047
Don't you lecture me.
I'm a good parent.

10:24.156 --> 10:27.182
<i>I would never let anything</i>
<i>happen to my boys!</i>

10:27.293 --> 10:30.023
Hold on, boys!

10:30.129 --> 10:33.064
- [Both Screaming]
- Mama's got you! Hold on!

10:33.165 --> 10:35.190
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Between the weather and the flying Bible...</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:38.361
<i>Catalina and Patty were pretty sure the man</i>
<i>upstairs was trying to tell 'em something.</i>

10:38.471 --> 10:40.439
<i>The question was what.</i>

10:40.539 --> 10:43.235
Please, God, we just need a sign.

10:43.342 --> 10:47.210
- <i>[Wind Howls]</i>
- Was that the sign?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.975
No. That's the sign.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.950
An ark!
Just like in the Bible.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.021
We gotta get in that boat.

10:56.122 --> 11:00.388
Floods are coming!

11:00.493 --> 11:02.393
Randy!

11:04.397 --> 11:07.525

- I'm gonna fly, Earl!

11:10.469 --> 11:12.699
Lucky baby. Wait up!

11:12.805 --> 11:15.399
Okay, I've tried to be nice.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.601
Now I'm not giving you a choice.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.003
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

11:21.113 --> 11:23.081
I'm gonna shoot you in the leg...

11:23.182 --> 11:25.673
drag you upstairs
and save your life.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.384
Did you shoot me?
Nothing happened.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.685
Do it again.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.723
The hell?

11:40.833 --> 11:43.427

11:43.536 --> 11:46.972
<i>[Earl Narrating] There was a reason</i>
<i>those bullets didn't hurt Randy or his pants.</i>

11:47.073 --> 11:50.907
All right, boys,
time for the annual birthday race!

11:51.010 --> 11:54.446
Are you sure you remembered
to put in the blanks this time?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.777
Yes.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.975
I miss Mom.

11:59.085 --> 12:02.418
On your mark,
get set-

12:18.037 --> 12:20.528
There's no way I missed you twice.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.800
Something weird's going on.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.545
I know.

12:26.645 --> 12:30.741
I've been sucked up by a tornado,
shot in the leg and nothing's happened to me.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.580
Maybe I'm invincible.

12:33.686 --> 12:37.315
Maybe you are,
or maybe I'm dreaming.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.687
- Ow!
- Nope.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.226
I'm invincible.
But why?

12:42.328 --> 12:44.694
Why am I invincible?
What am I supposed to do?

12:44.797 --> 12:46.958
<i>[Wind Howls]</i>

12:50.803 --> 12:56.469
Randy, I think God
made you invincible to do good.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.979
Cool.

13:03.149 --> 13:06.312
<i>[Earl Narrating] Finding out God</i>
<i>made your little brother invincible...</i>

13:06.418 --> 13:09.148
<i>kind of changes the dynamics</i>
<i>of your relationship.</i>

13:10.756 --> 13:14.214
See, Earl? All we had to do
was take one day off from the list...

13:14.326 --> 13:16.226
and it was the greatest day ever.

13:16.328 --> 13:20.424
For you. You get to be invincible
and go save people.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.127
I gotta rewrite my whole list
and go do it without you.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.830
Forget the list. Come with me
and watch me do awesome superhero stuff.

13:26.939 --> 13:30.500
- We'll get so much ass.
- I can't just forget the list, Randy.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.077
Well, I can't deny my superpowers.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.774
Are you saying we should
do stuff separately?

13:36.882 --> 13:39.077
'Cause that's what it sounds like,
and I don't like it.

13:39.185 --> 13:43.246
Hey, maybe karma
wants us to take turns with our missions.

13:43.355 --> 13:47.382
We can go back and forth
between my list and you helping people.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.518
I think God could live with that.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.792
Well, look at that.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.631
Mr. Genius's boat is gone.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.968
Look, Mom.
I found a gun.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.702
Give me that.
You're not 13 yet.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.971
Go look for your daddy.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.914
He's probably off in a ditch
writing a term paper...

14:11.016 --> 14:13.280
about how much smarter
he is than me.

14:13.385 --> 14:17.082
Swear to God, the next time he corrects me
on some nerd crap nobody cares about...

14:17.189 --> 14:19.919
I'm gonna pick him up
and slam his hair right through a-

14:20.025 --> 14:21.754

<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>With the Brat out of commission...</i>

14:23.929 --> 14:26.659
<i>Joy had to find a more creative way</i>
<i>to get Darnell to the hospital.</i>

14:26.765 --> 14:29.325
Darnell, everything's gonna be okay.
Don't worry about the kids.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.893
I left 'em with Eugenia.
Told her she keeps 'em safe, I'll bake her a pie.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.202
They'll be fine.
Bitch loves her pie.

14:36.308 --> 14:41.007
Mahumbo dogface
to the banana patch.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.741
- Michael Landon.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.044
No Michael Landon.
You stay away from him.

14:46.151 --> 14:48.813
You can't die.
You're the smart one in the relationship.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.151
What if we have to move
the stereo again?

14:51.257 --> 14:54.021
All those cords.
You fight, damn it.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.689
Lfigure I don't have to help everybody
with my superpowers.

14:59.798 --> 15:02.790
Like, if you're a guy that does experiments
on chimpanzees...

15:02.902 --> 15:05.700
and then you're trapped in a tree
by a bunch of chimpanzees...

15:05.804 --> 15:08.705
I'd be, like, "Sorry, bro."

15:08.807 --> 15:10.775
That seems reasonable.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.411
- <i>[Catalina] Earl! Randy!</i>
- Over here!

15:12.411 --> 15:13.469
- <i>[Catalina] Earl! Randy!</i>
- Over here!

15:13.579 --> 15:16.013
We need two men
to repopulate the Earth.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.946
No, thanks.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.245
We have steaks.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.320
I could eat.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.852
Yeah, really, it was nothing major.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.586

Hold on, baby. Hold on.

15:42.207 --> 15:44.437
- Hey, Earl.
- Hey, Crab-

15:44.543 --> 15:46.977
Bless his heart.
He took a header through the trailer wall.

15:47.079 --> 15:50.014
I gotta get him to a hospital
before his whole brain leaks out.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.777
I don't think you're gonna make it
to the hospital.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.612
<i>[Randy]</i>
<i>That's the biggest giant swirly wind thingy yet.</i>

15:57.723 --> 15:59.884
There's a storm cellar
behind the church.

They used to put special kids in there
for Sunday School.

16:02.394 --> 16:05.852
Oh, yeah. I got to go in there.
Earl didn't, 'cause he's not special.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.234
Guys, this is serious.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.530
If you don't get down to that cellar,
you're gonna die.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.231
God wants me and Patty
to stay on the boat.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.491

- Step aside.

I'm vincible!

16:48.273 --> 16:50.537
Move, dummy. I'll do it.

16:54.646 --> 16:58.082
Maybe my invincibility
went into the lock when I hit the door.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.381
No. The gun's shooting blanks,

Unscrew that garden hose.

Mr. MacGyver.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.367

17:58.477 --> 18:00.536
Come on, dummies.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.850
- Why are you doing this?
- Because God wants me to.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.942
Oh, so you know what God wants?

18:08.053 --> 18:11.420
Yes. God wants me
to stay in this ark.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.956
[Grunts]

18:16.228 --> 18:18.458
God wants me to go with you.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.096
Dag, that plan you came up with
was way beyond street smart.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.502
That was street genius.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.904
They were blanks.
I wasn't invincible.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.976
Probably not.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.545
But you did fly in a tornado.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.614
Nobody can take that away from you.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.615
Yeah, that's true.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.277
You know, at some point,
we're gonna have to talk about the fact...

18:41.386 --> 18:44.082
that you tried to shoot me twice,
but not right now.

18:44.189 --> 18:47.317
I really appreciate you dropping everything
and sticking with me.

18:47.426 --> 18:51.522
It's only fair.
You've always stuck with me.

18:51.630 --> 18:55.896
Next time you get a mission,
it'll be one day your mission, one day my list.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.798
Thanks, Earl.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.394
Oh, my God.
The list.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.577
Well, where-where did you get this?

19:05.677 --> 19:07.645
I found it right away.
It was on the boat.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.306
I was pretty pissed,
so I didn't wanna tell you.

19:10.415 --> 19:14.374
And then with the whole superhero thing,
I guess I just forgot about it.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.852
Wait. This-This doesn't make sense.

19:16.955 --> 19:21.449
I thought karma took the list
to teach me a lesson about finders, keepers.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.687
Now I'm not sure
what any of this meant.

19:23.795 --> 19:27.663
Tell me about it. Why did God give me
and Patty so many conflicting signs?

19:27.766 --> 19:32.362
Yeah. The gun, the Bible,
the boat, the Bible again.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.702
Yeah. And why did he make me think
I was invincible?

19:35.807 --> 19:39.299
You guys don't think
God's losing his mind, do you?

19:39.411 --> 19:42.175
I don't know how old he is,
but he's gotta be getting up there.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.579
Maybe all of it means nothing.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.241
Tornadoes tend to be
stressful times...

19:46.351 --> 19:49.377
in which people ascribe heightened meaning
to random events of physics.
