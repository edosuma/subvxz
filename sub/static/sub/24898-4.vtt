20:15.570 --> 20:17.443
his share of the company goes to you.

20:18.115 --> 20:19.787

20:20.508 --> 20:21.740

20:23.110 --> 20:26.241
You have no idea what it takes
to build something like this.

20:26.514 --> 20:28.448
The sacrifices we've had to make.

20:32.003 --> 20:33.987
I think it's time we
took a little break.

20:34.021 --> 20:35.191
Of course.

20:38.492 --> 20:39.856
Harley, maybe you could...

20:44.259 --> 20:45.332
<i>DAVE: Seriously?</i>

20:45.366 --> 20:46.852

20:46.877 --> 20:49.329
- but won't break my finger.
- You want me to get you a gun.

20:49.362 --> 20:50.541
Yeah, nothing too gangstery.

20:50.566 --> 20:51.675
Nothing too girly.

20:51.939 --> 20:54.174
- You don't have a permit.
- Sam won't give me one.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.408
Which is apparently what
this country has come to.

21:00.471 --> 21:01.492
Okay.

21:01.983 --> 21:03.783
Okay, really? Just like that?

21:04.112 --> 21:05.952

It's pretty easy.

21:05.987 --> 21:07.174
Well I want.

21:07.722 --> 21:08.788
Alright. Okay, okay.

21:09.741 --> 21:10.989
This is how it's gonna work.

21:11.343 --> 21:13.285
I'm gonna contact a guy,
tell him what I want.

21:13.483 --> 21:14.697
He's gonna give me a figure

21:14.722 --> 21:16.315
and then I'm gonna give
that figure to you.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.729
You pay me and a few days later,
you have your gun.

21:18.754 --> 21:19.988
Great, 'cause I hate haggling.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.179
Hold up, there's more.

21:21.204 --> 21:23.946
You're gonna take the gun and one day,

21:23.971 --> 21:25.862
probably in the first week,
you're gonna use it.

21:26.011 --> 21:28.269
Most likely in front of Sam to save her,

21:28.294 --> 21:31.187
impress her, whatever but
because you got it illegally,

21:31.212 --> 21:32.213
you're going to jail.

21:32.238 --> 21:34.806
Now first offense, you're looking
at six-months. Not long.

21:34.873 --> 21:37.250
But jail, and maybe this is a cliché,

21:37.492 --> 21:39.308
but jail isn't exactly a great place

21:39.333 --> 21:41.239
for famous pretty boys such as yourself.

21:42.256 --> 21:43.823
You could have just said no.

21:45.860 --> 21:47.047
Yeah I could have.

21:48.588 --> 21:50.640
<i>They called themselves the Fab Four.</i>

21:51.265 --> 21:53.986
But truth to be told they had
only one genius among them.

21:54.735 --> 21:56.861
It was a bit like if the
Beatles had three Ringos

21:56.886 --> 21:58.314
and only one John.

21:58.549 --> 22:00.324
The Beatles did only have one John.

22:00.349 --> 22:02.509
And there will only ever be one Ringo.

22:02.543 --> 22:03.710
Totally underrated.

22:04.111 --> 22:05.545
<i>Well, point being, gentlemen.</i>

22:05.579 --> 22:07.681
They had only one genius. One leader.

22:07.706 --> 22:10.181
And it wasn't Darlene or Jeff or Trevor.

22:10.885 --> 22:11.907
Well who was it?

22:12.186 --> 22:14.845
Well, meet Xavier Morton.

22:15.523 --> 22:16.957
This was his thesis.

22:18.359 --> 22:21.403
In most of the world,
we take connectivity for granted.

22:22.294 --> 22:23.990
But there are still hundreds of millions

22:24.015 --> 22:25.495
<i>who are being left behind.</i>

22:25.900 --> 22:30.070
My idea - XM Wire -
means you'd always be connected,

22:30.104 --> 22:31.926
anywhere in the world.

22:32.750 --> 22:36.673
And if we do it right
we can give it away.

22:37.454 --> 22:39.704
Let's invite everyone into the tent.

22:39.880 --> 22:43.191
<i>Give everyone the option to be included.</i>

22:44.385 --> 22:46.120
To never be alone.

22:49.223 --> 22:51.037
<i>A brilliant, brilliant young mind.</i>

22:51.292 --> 22:55.438
He had this naïve idealism
that only young people have.

22:56.998 --> 22:59.866
He didn't have the whole
technology perfected yet...

22:59.900 --> 23:02.030
But I would say he was very close.

23:02.716 --> 23:03.729
What happened?

23:03.826 --> 23:04.839
Who knows?

23:04.886 --> 23:06.932
The other three,
after school went on their own

23:06.957 --> 23:08.441
and created JTD.

23:08.476 --> 23:10.332
Which was based entirely on monetizing

23:10.357 --> 23:12.341
this fine gentleman's
technology and idea.

23:12.847 --> 23:15.731
<i>What happened next,
why he was excluded I can't say.</i>

23:16.283 --> 23:18.153
All I know is that two years later

23:19.485 --> 23:20.504
he was dead.

23:21.689 --> 23:22.699
Wow.

23:22.890 --> 23:23.957
<i>DAVE: Xavier Morton.</i>

23:23.991 --> 23:25.308
Dead at 22.

23:25.793 --> 23:28.074
Survived by a mom, dad and sis...

23:29.847 --> 23:31.822
By the way they don't
mention how he died,

23:31.847 --> 23:33.236
I'd say he committed suicide.

23:35.822 --> 23:37.691
If those jerks at JTD are behind this,

23:37.716 --> 23:39.464

24:36.771 --> 24:37.838

24:37.865 --> 24:40.467
- He just confessed to shooting Jeff.
- What?

24:40.501 --> 24:42.433
He picked Jeff up this morning

24:42.458 --> 24:44.129
before their big meeting
with the investor.

24:44.154 --> 24:46.536
He had the guns and they
both wanted to get pumped up.

24:46.561 --> 24:47.813
I don't know what happened.

24:48.454 --> 24:50.001
I shot a wax bullet at him...

24:50.344 --> 24:51.828
The next thing I knew he was dead.

24:51.853 --> 24:53.711
Why didn't you just say that?

24:54.782 --> 24:57.417
That I shot my friend
dead then I ran away

24:57.451 --> 24:58.821

24:59.954 --> 25:01.988
Yeah... it's kinda tough to spin.

25:02.423 --> 25:05.137

Yeah.

25:21.775 --> 25:23.745
There's just one problem.

25:25.131 --> 25:26.258
He may have pulled the trigger,

25:26.283 --> 25:28.055
but I think somebody else killed Jeff.

25:29.048 --> 25:31.390
- Why?
- Well there's just a couple of things

25:31.415 --> 25:33.102
that I need to confirm
first and I need your help.

25:33.127 --> 25:34.617

25:40.894 --> 25:43.660

I want you to ask Wes...

25:43.896 --> 25:45.636

And if I gave you the
wrong first impression,

26:04.361 --> 26:06.308
- I want to apologize.
- It's fine.

26:07.072 --> 26:08.136
Great.

26:08.673 --> 26:12.045
That said, Detective Shaw
and I were wondering.

26:12.858 --> 26:16.924
What if these were not the weapons
involved in the shooting?

26:18.917 --> 26:21.719
This one has the victim's
fingerprints on it.

26:22.297 --> 26:24.373
This one has fingerprints
from the man I believe

26:24.398 --> 26:26.203
has confessed to the shooting.

26:26.533 --> 26:27.594
Right... right.

26:27.643 --> 26:31.180
Okay, so um... what you're
saying is that this gun,

26:31.205 --> 26:33.499
let's just call it the... murder gun,

26:33.546 --> 26:36.132
fired the shot that killed the
guy holding the victim gun.

26:36.593 --> 26:39.021
Yes, a metal round could
have been substituted

26:39.046 --> 26:40.861
for the wax round, which would explain

26:40.886 --> 26:43.307
why I only found one wax
round at the scene.

26:43.550 --> 26:44.683
Okay, so...

26:44.708 --> 26:48.524
so what would you expect to find
in the barrel of the murder gun?

26:48.549 --> 26:49.814
I know what you're asking.

26:49.947 --> 26:51.516
You've seen some crime shows.

26:51.541 --> 26:53.809
You think that we can match
the marks on the bullet

26:53.834 --> 26:56.320
that we found in the Vic
to the barrel it came from, right?

26:56.354 --> 26:58.522
No, actually, what I'm...

26:58.557 --> 27:01.725
But what you don't get is
that pistols like these

27:01.750 --> 27:03.408
have smooth bore barrels.

27:03.433 --> 27:04.916
They don't make marks on the bullets.

27:04.941 --> 27:06.723
There's nothing to tie them together.

27:08.579 --> 27:15.448
OK, so if the murder gun fired
a wax pellet there would be wax

27:15.473 --> 27:16.673
inside of the barrel, right?

27:16.708 --> 27:19.720
Of course. But that wax would have
been obliterated by the metal round.

27:19.745 --> 27:21.046
Why am I explaining this to you?

27:21.071 --> 27:22.593
You're right. You are right.

27:27.632 --> 27:31.370
Mr. Wes would you humour me and
just look inside the barrel?

27:37.618 --> 27:38.635
