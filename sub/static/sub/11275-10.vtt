 has just published an article

    in my last paper.

     at the cuckoo corral.

03:51.652 --> 03:53.519
  and distinguished colleague

  to launch a personal attack

to meeting you.

      Oh. Any fan of mine       
is certainly welcome here,

 who could fire me like a shot.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.265
You got some 20-year-old Scotch?

04:56.299 --> 04:57.149
Uh, no, but we got some pretzels

         That'll do it.

05:05.809 --> 05:08.210
         things are going pretty
         good at the old bar.   

05:08.244 --> 05:09.612
Well, I'm glad                  
to hear that.                   

05:09.646 --> 05:11.213
We sank a lot                   
of bucks into it.               

05:11.247 --> 05:13.148
Oh, boy, don't talk to me       
      about sinking, man.       

05:13.182 --> 05:14.149

05:14.183 --> 05:15.618
         Yeah, I heard.         

05:15.652 --> 05:17.386
              Oh.

17:07.846 --> 17:08.980
            Me? Huh.            

17:09.013 --> 17:11.215
 So, uh, what's the good news?  

17:11.250 --> 17:13.718
                 That she wants 
                 to talk to you.

17:15.154 --> 17:17.454
          Yeah, Vera.           

17:17.490 --> 17:18.790
              Oh?               

17:18.824 --> 17:22.394
  Well, uh, uh, you following   
      the recipe exactly?       

17:22.428 --> 17:23.494
Oh, gee,                        
no, Vera, look.                 

17:23.529 --> 17:24.829
It's supposed to be

two cups of water,              
not vinegar.

    No, uh, get ahold           
    of yourself, now, Vera.

             Well, I was on my  
             way to the airport,

20:23.225 --> 20:24.392
                and I thought   
                I'd come by here

20:24.426 --> 20:26.360
        and clear this matter   
        up before I left.       

20:26.395 --> 20:27.996
Oh, yeah, listen,               
I gotta tell you,               

20:28.030 --> 20:30.264
that whole thing                
at the party was my fault.      

20:30.299 --> 20:31.616
I mean,                         
we had had a little tiff,       

20:31.651 --> 20:33.785
and she was trying              
to make me jealous.             
                        Yeah,   

20:33.819 --> 20:35.119
            I figured it was    
            something like that.

20:35.154 --> 20:36.488
        Yeah.                   
                        Yeah.   

20:36.522 --> 20:37.556
                  Well, I better
                  go back there 

20:37.590 --> 20:38.890
        and apologize to her.

                  Well, yeah,   
                  I overreacted.

20:43.228 --> 20:44.829
                  I was a little
                  rough on her. 

20:44.864 --> 20:45.830
    Oh.                         

20:45.865 --> 20:46.831
                        Yeah.   

20:46.866 --> 20:48.065
Uh, actually, uh,               

20:48.100 --> 20:49.501
          give me a second here,
          will you? Um...       

20:49.535 --> 20:51.002
          She probably          
      needs to freshen up.      

20:51.036 --> 20:52.837
    She's pretty upset          
      by this whole thing.      

20:52.872 --> 20:57.141
     Her mascara's probably     
down in her shoes by now.

for that, bartender?

Oh, no charge, Mr. Drake.       

21:01.480 --> 21:03.915
    I mean, after all,          
you kind of own the place.      

21:03.949 --> 21:06.451
Oh, no, no, no, no,             
I'll pay for it.

21:09.255 --> 21:10.222
All right.                      

21:10.256 --> 21:11.923
        I'll need to see        
      a driver's license.       

21:17.229 --> 21:18.046
          Listen, I did my best.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.931

             the jealousy story,

21:26.338 --> 21:28.723

            that if, uh,        

21:28.757 --> 21:30.492
              if you were really
              in love with me,  

21:30.526 --> 21:31.826
    that he might understand.   

21:31.860 --> 21:33.961
You know, that it would         
explain everything,             

21:33.996 --> 21:35.497
but he just...                  
didn't buy that.                

21:35.531 --> 21:37.365
                Oh, God, what am
                I going to do?  

21:37.400 --> 21:39.267
I don't know.                   
I don't know.                   

21:39.301 --> 21:41.252
        Unless...               

21:41.287 --> 21:42.554
    Unless what? What?          

21:42.588 --> 21:45.323
Ah... No, no, yeah,             
yeah, that wouldn't work.       

21:45.357 --> 21:46.507
                No, no, what?   
                Tell me, please.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.609
Well, all right, well,          
maybe, you know, if...          

21:48.644 --> 21:50.262
well, if he were                
to walk in here                 

21:50.296 --> 21:51.496
and find you kissing me         

21:51.530 --> 21:53.632
more passionately               
than you kissed him...

              something, buster.
All right.                      

22:00.105 --> 22:01.740
            I still have a      
            little self-respect.

22:01.774 --> 22:03.441
          I have a little pride.
          ( <i>knocking</i> )          

22:03.476 --> 22:05.009
Have it your way.               

22:05.043 --> 22:06.027
             Hello.             

22:10.616 --> 22:11.683
      ( <i>clearing throat</i> )       

22:16.455 --> 22:17.205
    Oh. Ha.                     

22:17.240 --> 22:18.289
Sorry, Evan, there.             

22:18.324 --> 22:20.759
I didn't, uh, didn't            
hear you come in there.         

22:20.793 --> 22:22.026
    You know how it is          
    with young lovers, here.    

22:22.060 --> 22:23.461
    We just can't keep          
our hands off each other.       

22:23.496 --> 22:25.029
Yeah.                           

22:27.833 --> 22:29.467
    You're a lucky man, Sam.    

22:29.502 --> 22:30.535
Oh, yeah,                       
you're telling me.              

22:30.569 --> 22:31.703
Well, this little               
honey of mine                   

22:31.737 --> 22:34.005
gives me a lot                  
of good loving, don't you?      

22:35.641 --> 22:36.841
                Sure do, punkin.

22:39.311 --> 22:41.613
          Well, I just          
      came by to apologize      

22:41.647 --> 22:43.648
for how I reacted earlier.      

22:43.683 --> 22:45.650
                      Apologize?

22:45.685 --> 22:47.452
                    To <i>me?</i>      

22:47.486 --> 22:49.120
Well, yeah, I told Sam outside. 

22:49.155 --> 22:51.088
                You told Sam?   

22:52.858 --> 22:54.192
    Gotcha.                     

22:57.496 --> 23:00.047
      So why don't we just      
not say anything more about it? 

23:00.082 --> 23:01.382
I think                         
that's a great idea.            

23:01.417 --> 23:03.485
Uh, let me walk you             
to the car here.                
            Yeah.               

23:03.519 --> 23:04.719
            Malone.             
No, no.                         

23:04.753 --> 23:06.487
     I think we should say      
    nothing more about this.    

23:14.012 --> 23:15.013
      Sam, get back here.       

23:15.047 --> 23:17.849
Ha. Some women                  
just can't get enough.          

23:18.885 --> 23:21.152
                 You haven't met
                 my wife, Sam.  

23:21.186 --> 23:22.453
SAM:                            
Oh... Oh...                     

23:22.487 --> 23:23.487
Good night.                     

23:25.724 --> 23:27.659
Hey, listen. Come on.           

23:27.693 --> 23:29.294
I'm just having                 
a little fun with you.          

23:29.328 --> 23:30.795
You know,                       
I know why you're upset.        

23:30.829 --> 23:32.430
You found out something         
in that room                    

23:32.464 --> 23:33.464
you hadn't counted on.          

23:33.499 --> 23:35.533
Your true feelings              
were revealed.                  

23:35.568 --> 23:37.302
             What?              

23:37.336 --> 23:39.053
No woman                        
can kiss like that              

23:39.087 --> 23:40.422
and not mean it.                

23:40.456 --> 23:41.305
            Are you nuts?       

23:41.340 --> 23:42.557
No, no, no.                     

23:42.591 --> 23:43.724
No, it can't be done.           

23:43.759 --> 23:45.393
You can't fake passion          
like that.                      

23:45.428 --> 23:47.062
    Oh, is that right?          

23:47.096 --> 23:48.096
Hey, Fras.                      

24:00.109 --> 24:01.793
                Nice try.       

24:05.865 --> 24:07.365
