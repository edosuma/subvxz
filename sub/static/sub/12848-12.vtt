WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.735
<i>So far, the fire
has destroyed nine homes...</i>

00:03.738 --> 00:06.338
This fire keeps spreading.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.773
Okay.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.207
Yeah, word from the front is
it's only getting worse.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.110
We can expect more burn victims

00:11.112 --> 00:13.045
and more smoke-inhalation
patients.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.581
A lot more. Everybody,
get your game faces on!

00:15.583 --> 00:17.016
Hard to put on your game face

00:17.018 --> 00:18.550
when your owner's
throwing the game.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.085
Do you have an ETA
on our pink slips?

00:20.087 --> 00:21.320
Whoa, whoa.
Nothing's official.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.022
Hobart hasn't bought anything
yet, right?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.189
That's right.
They haven't.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.557
And I've reached out
to other buyers

00:25.559 --> 00:27.326
to try and convince them
to top Hobart's bid

00:27.328 --> 00:29.428
and keep us together.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.529
So until I hear back, let's...
Let's keep the faith, Mollie.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.765
My landlord doesn't take faith

00:32.767 --> 00:34.266
at the first of the month,
Topher.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.235
Mollie!
Heat exhaustion.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.203
Just needs an I.V.,
couple hours off his feet.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.571
He ain't the only one.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.373
Mollie.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.208
Topher, don't take it
personally, okay?

00:43.210 --> 00:45.144
Mollie's got three offers
from other E.R.s.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.896
All of the nurses have options.

00:46.897 --> 00:48.647
I hear some of the doctors, too.
How many do you have now?

00:48.649 --> 00:51.116
Three.
Including Baltimore.

00:51.118 --> 00:53.452
Gwen wants me to move back,
but I'm not biting.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.538
Okay?
Neither is anyone else here.

00:55.539 --> 00:57.623
We all know we're never gonna find
a work family like this again.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.591
Hey, she needs a head C.T.
and stitches.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.294
Chopper's refueling, then going
back for more patients,

01:02.296 --> 01:04.430
but it looks like space
is at a premium here.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.532
Well, we'll find more space.
Everybody, stop worrying.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.100
The E.R. is <i> not</i> closing.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.602
There's a lot of interest in
this place, I'm telling you.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.371
We're gonna stay together.
It's gonna be fine.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.839
Yeah, no,
I-I-I agree.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.208
It's all right. It's all...
It's all gonna be fine.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.110
Yeah, for you and Scott.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.812
You're surgeons.
Hobart won't drop you.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.146
The rest of us are S.O.L.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.548
30-year-old female

01:22.550 --> 01:24.616
scouting the fire on an ATV
when it rolled.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.135
She wound up in the flames.

01:26.136 --> 01:27.653
Second- and third-degree burns
to her abdominal wall.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.556
Possible internal injuries.
ATV landed right on top of her.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.224
Okay. Trauma 1.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.426
And you've got more coming in.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.761
What happened?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.463
Knucklehead was trying to save
his furry friends

01:37.465 --> 01:38.664
when the fire broke out.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.099
Trap bit him.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.533
Maybe a little bit of
situational awareness

01:41.535 --> 01:43.302
might save you some pain
next time, you damn hippie.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.270
Okay. Incoming.
Trauma 2.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.339
My name is Derrick,
and it's nothing like the pain

01:47.341 --> 01:48.707
those animals feel, you fascist!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.843
Hey, Mac!

01:50.845 --> 01:53.846
Last time I saw you, you were
laying down fire in Afghanistan.

01:53.848 --> 01:56.181
Last time I saw you,
you were running from it.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.583
Hey, Drew.
This is Mac Riley.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.885
He helped T.C. and I out
last year in Afghanistan.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.687
- Oh.
- Drew Alister, Army doc.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.989
Iraq, Afghanistan.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.290
Still racking up trips...
Can't get enough.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.591
Yeah, you're gonna miss it
when you're out.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.326
- Drew!
- Oh! Hey, uh, duty calls.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.560
- Good to meet you, man.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.329
- Thank you.
- Oh, hey, Doc.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.563
- Yeah.
- Look, before I head back out,

02:11.565 --> 02:13.182
I got a favor to ask you.

02:13.183 --> 02:14.800
Thinking about getting back
into the contracting field,

02:14.802 --> 02:16.869
and, uh, I just need
a doc's John Hancock

02:16.871 --> 02:17.870
on my physical form.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.671
Yeah, sure.
Come on back.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.806
I'll check you out.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.875
Yeah, I got to get back
to my team, Doc.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.743
W-Why don't you just
pencil-whip that?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.879
Well, I ca...
I can't just sign it.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.914
Quick physical,
you're on your way.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.150
10 minutes tops.
Hey, Natalie?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.885
Uh, can we set him up,
uh, Trauma 3?

02:32.887 --> 02:35.354
- Sure thing.
- Hey, so, where's T.C.?

02:35.356 --> 02:36.822
He's back overseas.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.357
You can take the boy
out of the fight,

02:38.359 --> 02:39.491
not the fight out of the boy.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.227
Yeah, tell me about it.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.373 --> 02:55.440
We've been here a month and the Turks
still won't let us cross the border.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.643
You change those dressings
twice a day.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.944
Thank you.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.546
Your help is much appreciated.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.481
But many more of my people
are in need.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.916
Well, there are only two
of us, Hamdi,

03:03.918 --> 03:06.618
so we're doing the best
with what we have.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.620
Do you want this?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.837
Get back!

03:33.581 --> 03:36.381
Looks like we're gonna need
more supplies.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.454
Excuse me, sir!
Sir!

03:42.456 --> 03:44.690
We have walked many miles...
No food, no water!

03:44.692 --> 03:45.824
Sir, please.
Many of us are hurt.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.559
Please help.
What are you doing?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.228
We don't know where
these people came from.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.846
We don't know who they are.

03:50.847 --> 03:52.463
We didn't know Hamdi until
we knew him, either, okay?

03:52.466 --> 03:53.765
Okay, but we are at capacity,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.300
and we are running out of drugs.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.802
Sometimes you just got
to wing it, okay?

03:56.803 --> 03:58.303
We'll... We'll make a plan
later. We'll just figure it out.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.438
Open the gate.
No, no, no!

03:59.440 --> 04:00.706
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

04:00.708 --> 04:03.675
Don't open the gate!
Don't open the gate!

04:05.279 --> 04:06.511
Hey! Hey! Calm down!

04:06.513 --> 04:07.646
Close the gate!

04:07.648 --> 04:10.449
Calm down! It's okay!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:10.451 --> 04:12.985
There's water in the tent.

04:16.557 --> 04:19.658
I just feel like you've been
really distant this week.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.326
No, I have not been distant.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.428
I'm just... There's so much
going on here

04:23.430 --> 04:25.397
with the possible sale
of this place.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.833
I mean, do I go back to Dallas
if it happens?

04:27.835 --> 04:29.835
Do I stay?
Dallas?

04:29.837 --> 04:32.437
- Well...
- And here do I fit in there?

04:32.439 --> 04:34.706
Well, I don't know.
It's...

04:34.708 --> 04:36.508
There's my answer.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.877
Look, there's so much going on
here tonight.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.479
Can we talk about it later?

04:40.481 --> 04:42.481
<i>Dr. Franklin, 3721.</i>
Sure.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.549
<i>Dr. Franklin, 3721.</i>
Yo, Toph. Hey.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.118
Hey, we got a problem.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.686
Uh, I just finished inventory
on Pyxis,

04:47.688 --> 04:49.921
and drugs came up missing.
Uh, a dozen Norco.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.990
Now, the day shift's count
was all good, so this is on us.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.292
- You sure?
- I triple checked.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.559
I know how bad this looks
with you

04:54.561 --> 04:56.061
trying to find another buyer
for the hospital.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.629
I mean, this could scare them
all away.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.498
Don't remind me.
Okay. Check the logs.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.633
Uh, see who accessed the Pyxis.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.935
This can get sticky, so until
we know more, keep it quiet.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.003
Okay.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.478
Everything... hurts.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.946
I'm not surprised.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.515
You've got a bad stomach burn
and bruises everywhere.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.384
Just try to relax.
I'm Dr. Rivera, by the way.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.919
Valeska.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.522
Two months on the job
and I'm already in the E.R.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.890
Mom's gonna love this.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.459
She didn't want you to be
a firefighter?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.561
Oh, she wanted me to remain
what I was...

05:29.563 --> 05:31.029
A drone in a cubicle.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.699
In before sunrise,
out after sunset.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.601
I was more vampire than human.
I hated it.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.370
But my mom, she loved it.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.705
Probably seemed safer to her.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.473
Mm, safety had nothing
to do with it.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.076
She... It was just
what was expected.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.712
It was all that was expected.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.946
You know, don't rock the boat.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.382
Don't color outside the lines.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.753
Maybe she was right.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.760
Okay, level with me, Doc.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.663
Will... Will I be able to return
to the department?

06:04.665 --> 06:07.366
We're gonna do everything we can
to make that happen.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.002
Uh,
it t-took me eight years

06:11.004 --> 06:13.138
to work up the courage
to leave that job.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.440
If I end up back
where I started,

06:15.442 --> 06:17.909
it'll be like everything I did
in between was all...

06:17.911 --> 06:19.544
for naught.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.481
Like... Like it Nev...
Never happened.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.449
Like I never left.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.685
I know that feeling.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.987
Valeska, are you feeling
short of breath?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.155
Mm.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.690
Get me a blood gas kit,

06:31.692 --> 06:33.725
and please see if Dr. Cummings
is out of surgery.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.631
I checked the log.
Mollie, Jocelyn, and Heather

06:39.633 --> 06:41.400
were the only ones to access
the Pyxis tonight.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.567
But Annie shadowed all of them.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.769
Annie. I forgot
she's been shadowing.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.003
This night just keeps
getting better.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.560
Tell me about it.

06:46.561 --> 06:48.116
Just got a call
from my landlord.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.672
The bathroom in my gym leaked
into the business below.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.176
$2,500 in water damage
and climbing.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.795
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:52.796 --> 06:54.413
I don't know how you do this job
<i>and</i> run a business.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.148
Yeah, me neither.
Probably not the best of ideas.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.083
But, look, as far as suspects
are concerned,

06:58.085 --> 07:00.018
I think Annie's a pretty good
place to start.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.486
Come on, man.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.955
You really think that three
of our best nurses

07:02.956 --> 07:04.423
just up and suddenly decided
to start stealing drugs?

07:04.425 --> 07:05.791
- No, that's not... that's not...
- Hey, what...

07:05.793 --> 07:08.493
What are you talking about?
Who's stealing drugs?

07:08.495 --> 07:09.928
Let... Let's talk
about this...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.496
Uh, Norco is missing
from the Pyxis.

07:11.498 --> 07:12.864
Several nurses used it tonight.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.599
We're just trying
to narrow down who.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.168
And you think Annie did it.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.069
- Nobody said that.
- No, but you're thinking it.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.805
Are <i> you</i> thinking it?

07:19.807 --> 07:23.742
I'm thinking that you need
to be really careful

07:23.744 --> 07:26.044
about rushing to judgment
on something like that.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.846
That's what I'm thinking.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.647
And, no, she's come way too far
to do something like that.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.149
I will go ask her
right now myself.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.984
- She won't lie to me.
- Okay, wait. Hold... Hold on.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.152
May... Maybe take a beat,
Scott.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.987
Just... Just let us
figure this out.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.589
Yeah, seems like you already
have, Topher.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.791
Sc...

07:39.793 --> 07:41.893
What did I say about this night
getting worse?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.595
All right.
Talk with the other nurses.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.629
Do not get them riled up.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.897
This cannot blow up

07:45.898 --> 07:47.164
right when I'm trying to hold
this together!

07:47.167 --> 07:48.099
I got you.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.068
103.2.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.203
We got to get
your temperature down.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.939
Down?
Feels like I'm freezing.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.175
I haven't felt warm since we
left our village three days ago.

07:57.177 --> 08:00.545
- Syrian forces kick you out?
- The Caliphate.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.547
They attacked last month.

08:02.549 --> 08:05.116
We tried to hold out for as long
as possible, but couldn't.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.085
We walked 30 miles here,
to the border,

08:07.087 --> 08:09.688
took turns carrying my
grandmother for the last three.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.057
That's big of you, stepping up
to take care of her like that.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.960
- Squeeze.
- She has done much more for me.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.996
Sahin, you said it hurts.
Can you tell me where?

08:17.998 --> 08:21.199
My muscles, my bones.
All over.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.977
Looks like we're not as popular
as we used to be.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.812
It's not you.
It's us.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.881
We're Kurds.
They're Arabs.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.467
Meaning?

08:38.467 --> 08:40.051
One group has been robbed
of their rights,

08:40.053 --> 08:42.587
stripped of their land,
had their people killed.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.156
And the other group is Arabs.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.125
I'm sure the Arabs
would disagree.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.127
We both know
it's not that simple.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.597
Dr. Callahan, may I speak
with you privately, please?

09:00.974 --> 09:03.108
Every single one
of these new refugees,

09:03.110 --> 09:06.011
they're nauseous, they're
suffering from aches and pains,

09:06.013 --> 09:08.847
they're spiking a fever...
Some of them are delirious.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.916
And make no mistake...
This is not the flu.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.150
Okay, Syd,
you need to calm down.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.286
Don't tell me to calm down.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.955
These people probably
have malaria,

09:16.957 --> 09:21.159
and they are now inside
our camp, infecting everybody.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.662
That's what winging it got us.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.031
We already had a humanitarian
crisis on our hands.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.568
Now you just made it worse.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.855
Okay, how exactly
did this happen?

09:50.857 --> 09:54.659
Well, as the story goes,
I was, you know, in the woods

09:54.661 --> 09:57.162
disarming traps, you know,
when the fire came.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.799
I had <i> just</i> released
this furry little coyote.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.968
So cute. He looked just like
Wile E. Coyote.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.604
So I just freed him.
He goes off.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.005
And then the next thing I know,

10:07.007 --> 10:10.208
like, flames are just
all around me.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.877
Mm-hmm. Well, I totally
panicked like an idiot.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.980
And then I fell.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.648
The trap snapped back on me,

10:16.650 --> 10:19.751
and then, y-you know,
here we are.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.286
Okay.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.721
Man.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.889
Well, you just earned yourself
a tetanus shot

10:24.891 --> 10:26.691
and probably some nerve damage.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.894
Are you married?
Uh, no.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.731
So, we're gonna get
a surgical consult on this.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.183
And in the meantime,

10:34.184 --> 10:35.634
I'm gonna get this thing
off your arm, okay?

10:35.636 --> 10:37.202
Oh, okay.
Sound good?

10:37.203 --> 10:38.769
Hey, Vince,
can you help me out here?

10:38.772 --> 10:41.172
Push down on both sides.
Okay, great.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.041
Let's do this on three, okay?

10:43.043 --> 10:44.109
All right.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.644
One...
Yeah.

10:45.646 --> 10:46.811
Two...

10:48.048 --> 10:50.649
You said three,
Dr. Alexander!

10:50.651 --> 10:52.917
Yeah.
Ohh!

10:52.919 --> 10:55.987
Oh, man, that's not cool!

10:55.989 --> 10:57.922
Deep breaths.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.357
Follow my finger.
Here's...

10:59.359 --> 11:01.226
Okay, just...
Is all this necessary?

11:01.228 --> 11:04.195
We'll see. We'll see.
Extend your arms, palms up.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.965
Close your eyes.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.935
Okay.
Will you sign the paper now?

11:10.937 --> 11:14.005
Mac, your left arm has what
we call pronator drift.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.808
It could be a symptom
of a brain abnormality.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.277
Or it could be an old
high-school football injury?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.346
Oh, or the bullet
I took for you.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.682
Okay, well, let's run
a C.T. scan to be safe.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.450
Come on.
After everything I did for you

11:25.452 --> 11:27.952
last year in Afghanistan,
just sign the damn paper.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.854
Why is it so important
to go back?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.956
You've done your part.
You're home now.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.391
You've got Team Rubicon.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.060
It's just not the same.

11:35.062 --> 11:38.363
Look, overseas, I kicked doors,

11:38.365 --> 11:42.167
flew in helicopters,
rolled up bad guys.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.269
Over there, I had a purpose.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.705
Back here, I'm just...

11:46.707 --> 11:48.473
Well, I'm on an island.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.974
I got to get off.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.377
Hey, listen, I get it.
I get it, brother.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.879
But this is about due diligence.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.948
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna jump the line.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.250
I'll get you
a C.T. scan ASAP.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.452
Just sit tight.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.222
I can't even believe
you seen that.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.257
It was way too scary.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.358
I can't wait for tomorrow.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.060
I'm finally gonna be
your daughter.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.729
You already are in my eyes.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.263
Know that.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.132
I can't wait for the party,
either.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.501
I pretty much invited everyone
from the hospital.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.769
What did you do?

12:17.771 --> 12:18.870
Those are the crosses
right there.

12:18.871 --> 12:19.970
Where? What do you mean
you invited everyone?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.873
Yeah,
everybody from the E.R.,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.475
ICU, surgical department.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.076
Oh, you did, did you?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.377
I'll get Rick
to pick up more pizzas.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.413
- Papa Drew.
- Yo... Okay.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.881
All right.
I got to go, kiddo.

12:29.883 --> 12:30.882
- Okay.
- Mwah!

12:30.884 --> 12:32.751
- Hey, Mollie.
- Yes?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.886
Can you get this, uh, little
inmate back to her cell?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.287
- She escaped again.
- Of course I will.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.423
- All right.
- Come on, escapee.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.891
Bye.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.170
We were fine
before the Kurds arrived.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.805
Now we are weak and ill.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.373
Two of my people are dead.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.041
And we lost many more.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.445
You know, let's focus on
saving those we still can.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.047
You know what?
We stayed, and we fought.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.916
Perhaps if your people
did the same thing

13:04.918 --> 13:06.284
instead of running
like cowards...

13:06.286 --> 13:09.020
Okay, okay. Hey.
That's enough.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.323
Why don't you go outside,
feed your people?

13:12.325 --> 13:13.992
Let us do our job.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.462
All right?
You do the same.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.030
Feed your people.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.036
I don't know what's gonna kill
these people first...

13:25.038 --> 13:26.805
This outbreak
or their own hatred.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.573
You can't judge until you've
walked a mile in their shoes.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.342
Like you have?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.110
I'm not judging, I'm just trying
to help these people.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.978
And they're more interested
in killing one another

13:33.980 --> 13:34.946
than they are in healing.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.347
So you're judging.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.216
Now I'm starting to understand
why Drew hit you.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.884
You got something you want
to say to me?

13:39.886 --> 13:41.586
Yeah. You're so lucky.
If I could spare the help,

13:41.588 --> 13:43.822
you'd be on the first thing
smoking back to the States.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.323
- But you can't.
- Just finish the test.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.559
Already did.
Good news... not malaria.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.994
Bad news... we still don't know
what's killing these people.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.364
And we better figure it out
before the body count rises.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.369
All right.
What do we got?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.104
Sats are holding,
but B.P. is down.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.372
Yeah, certainly took a beating.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.107
Multiple contusions
to her head and chest.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.442
I'm more worried
about her abdomen.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.377
Full thickness burns to
the entire abdominal wall.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.846
She needs
surgical decompression.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.013
Whoa. Slow down.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.248
Let's finish your evaluation

14:10.249 --> 14:11.482
before we reach for the knife,
all right?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.017
I had a patient like this
in med school.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.302
Swelling from the burn

14:14.303 --> 14:15.586
strangled his intestinal organs
and he died.

14:15.589 --> 14:16.922
Quickly.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.256
All right, well, this is not
med school, Shannon.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.691
You don't want to make
an impulsive decision

14:19.692 --> 14:21.125
with this patient based on
a bad outcome with another.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.894
We need to be thorough here,
okay?

14:22.896 --> 14:26.097
I am not being impulsive.
I'm using my judgment.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.999
And I asked for a consult,
not a lecture.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.234
And you got one.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.269
I think you're confusing
activity with action.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.104
And sometimes the best course
of action is none.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.139
I won't risk cutting someone
open who may not need it.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.008
Now, I'm heading to surgery
on someone who does.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.143
You do a full trauma work-up
and then get back to me.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.785
We don't want to miss anything,
all right?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.887
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:48.889 --> 14:49.954
- Got a sec?
- Uh, yeah.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.122
For you, of course.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.290
Hey, you ready
for the party tomorrow?

14:52.292 --> 14:53.992
Drew...

14:53.994 --> 14:56.427
the court date for Brianna
isn't gonna happen tomorrow.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.096
- What? Why?
- Honestly, no idea.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.198
- I'm trying to find out now.
- Is it the arrest?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.100
The... The bar fight with T.C.?
No.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.068
That was all cleared up.
I'm still digging.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.169
I mean, it could just be

15:05.171 --> 15:06.971
that the judge's schedule
is too full.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.907
Let's just see
what it is first, okay?

15:08.909 --> 15:11.342
And let's not tell Brianna
until we know more.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.044
Find out as soon
as you can, okay?

15:13.046 --> 15:14.979
Yeah. Will do.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.247
- Hey.
- Yeah?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.615
Hey, Doc.
Hey, Topher said

15:17.616 --> 15:18.982
he's gonna get me
out of here quick,

15:18.985 --> 15:20.285
but he keeps shining me on.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.586
Look, I-I just need
a doc's signature

15:21.588 --> 15:23.388
on this stupid physical form.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.657
Well, if he hasn't signed it,
it's probably for good reason.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.592
- What'd he have you do?
- Some dumb pronator test.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.260
I can tell you why
I messed it up.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.596
Where'd you get that?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.331
Ask your buddy Topher.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.234
Look, can you help me
push this through?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.635
All right,
he's been out forever.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.004
He doesn't get guys like us.
You're still in. You do.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.607
Help me get this
damn thing signed.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.108
He owes me.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.611
I'll talk to him.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.046
All right.
Thanks.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.615
Do you think I took them?

15:50.617 --> 15:53.084
No.
Of course I don't.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.186
And I told them
that you wouldn't.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.621
But those drugs are missing,

15:56.623 --> 15:58.656
and you were shadowing
those nurses.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.391
So everybody else thinks I did.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.226
Look, I'm gonna ask you
this once,

16:02.228 --> 16:04.395
as the Chief of Surgery,
for them,

16:04.397 --> 16:06.331
just to put the whole thing
to bed.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.565
Did you take those drugs, Annie?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.267
No!
Good.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.535
I swear.
I believe you.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.236
I did not.
I know.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.005
And I'm sorry I even had to ask.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.974
- Okay? Don't worry.
- Hey.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.175
Jordan needs you in Trauma 2.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.743
Her patient just took a turn
for the worse.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.446
Okay. Hang in there.
I'll see you in a bit.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.051
I didn't take them.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.453
Okay.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.123
Let's get him
on high-flow oxygen.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.625
Hey.
What's going on?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.394
I thought this guy just had
a soft-tissue injury.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.129
It was, but after I removed
his trap,

16:38.131 --> 16:39.597
his sats plummeted
and he lost consciousness.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.265
Any ideas?

16:41.267 --> 16:42.667
Maybe there was something
on the trap?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.136
Could be poison,
animal feces, urine?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.305
Anyway, he's having trouble
breathing, so...

16:47.307 --> 16:49.240
Maybe he actually got bit.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.641
No, I checked.
No bites.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.010
Hey, give me a hand.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.413
Thank you.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.448
Yeah, diminished breath sounds.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.752
- Okay, where's the trap?
- It's right there on the table.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.358
Hey, there's pieces
of this thing broken off.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.727
If one of these broke off
inside him,

17:09.729 --> 17:11.262
it would go straight
to the lung.

17:11.263 --> 17:12.480
All right.
I'll call the O.R.

17:12.481 --> 17:14.080
and let them know we're on our way.
Okay.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.351
Damn it.

17:16.352 --> 17:17.667
There's no time for that now.
He's crashing.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.369
We got to open him up
right here.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.439
Let's get him down.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.740
Get me a thoracotomy tray.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.742
Let's prep to open.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.381
- He's been down for two minutes.
- I know.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.316
- I'm aware of that, Jordan.
- He doesn't have much...

17:32.318 --> 17:34.485
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got it. I got it.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.220
Gotcha.
Wow.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.789
You little bastard.

17:37.791 --> 17:39.357
That thing is huge.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.591
7-0 chromic.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.367
Removing cross clamps.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.637
His heart's beating again.
Good job.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.640
Send a blood gas.
We're gonna get closed up here.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.808
Can I talk to you
about something?

17:56.810 --> 17:59.110
Just between us?
Yeah.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.412
You know about
the missing Norco?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.647
I do.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.216
Everybody thinks
that Annie took it.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.851
But I know that she didn't
take it,

18:06.853 --> 18:09.554
and it's really pissing me off
that nobody believes her.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.222
Scott, come on.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.257
You can't blame people
for being suspicious.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.293
- She's an addict.
- Yeah, I know she's an addict.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.595
I'm an addict, too,
but you trust <i> me,</i> don't you?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.097
Yeah, I trust you.
Okay.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.331
But you are not her.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.432
She didn't do it.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.532
I'm telling you
she didn't do it.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.502
I asked her point-blank.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.204
And I know we've had
our issues lately,

18:26.206 --> 18:28.606
but she wouldn't lie to me.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.808
So I could really use
your support on this,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.276
is what I'm asking for.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.881
Okay.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.884
Thank you. That means a lot.
I appreciate it.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.419
Yes.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.555
- Hey. Topher.
- Hey.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.858
So, I spoke with Annie
about those missing drugs,

18:46.860 --> 18:49.360
and she says she didn't do it.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.697
And you should know that Jordan
is standing behind her, as well.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.265
- Jordan is?
- Yes.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.300
She is, because she trusts me.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.669
Which is a courtesy
that I <i> really</i> wish

18:58.671 --> 19:00.304
you were extending to me,
as well.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.873
Listen, Scott,
I want to believe that.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.709
I really do.
But somebody stole those drugs.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.878
Okay, look.
I told you I would talk to her.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.413
I did. She said she didn't do
it, so that's it.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.449
Period.
End of story.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.484
So stop the witch hunt
and search everybody.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.722
That could have gone better.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.756
Yeah.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.191
Hey, uh, not to bug you,

19:20.193 --> 19:21.792
but any news on the new bidder?

19:21.794 --> 19:23.227
No, I'm still waiting to hear.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.529
Keep your fingers crossed.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.830
Everything's crossed.
I'll catch you later.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.398
Yo, Paul, got a minute?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.333
Uh, yeah, sure.
What's up?

19:29.335 --> 19:31.469
- Uh, I wanted to ask you...
- Toph.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.172
What's with this Mac thing?
I saw his pronator issue.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.873
That drift could be
from nerve damage

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
caused by that bullet wound
in his arm.

19:37.877 --> 19:38.843
He pay you to come bug me?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.412
We're a bit backed up,

19:40.413 --> 19:41.980
and I'm waiting on the results.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.548
I just think he really wants
to get back in the fight,

19:43.550 --> 19:44.782
and we shouldn't be the ones
to stop him.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.350
It's about more than medicine.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.554
See, I think he wants back
because he's afraid.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.622
Home is foreign and awkward.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.791
War is familiar and comforting.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.459
He's delaying the inevitable.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.362
He needs to face it if he ever
wants to resume a normal life.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.332
It's easier for you.
You're a doctor. You got family.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.434
That helped your transition.
Mac's got none of that.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.036
He was a door-kicker.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.637
Those skills don't transfer
over to civilian life.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.340
Toph, you got to change
your identity.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.275
So you got to consider
what happens

20:11.277 --> 20:12.710
to a man when he loses his.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.250
We have to keep testing

20:19.252 --> 20:20.451
till we find out
what's killing everyone.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.036
Test them!

20:22.037 --> 20:23.620
They are the ones who brought
disease into this camp.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.822
Maybe you should go back!

20:24.824 --> 20:26.557
Go back where, huh?

20:28.928 --> 20:31.329
Stop! Stop!

20:36.936 --> 20:40.938
Sahin, keep your head down.
Keep your head down.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.748
Hey! Hey!

20:50.750 --> 20:53.951
Hey! Listen to me!
Listen to me.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.754
If you don't stop fighting
and let us do our jobs,

20:56.756 --> 20:58.889
more of you are gonna die,
all right?

20:58.891 --> 21:00.591
This infection doesn't care

21:00.593 --> 21:02.727
where you're from
or who you are.

21:02.729 --> 21:06.931
You, you, you, me...
It doesn't matter.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.268
So you can either
swallow your pride

21:10.270 --> 21:13.271
and let us figure it out,
or you can keep fighting,

21:13.273 --> 21:15.606
and none of us
will leave this camp alive.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.575
Now, I don't want to die.
Do you want to die?

21:17.577 --> 21:18.709
- No.
- No.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.745
So let us do our job.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.848
All right?

21:25.718 --> 21:28.386
Let's get you inside.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.453
Thank you.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.022
Okay, let's get you checked out.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.391
Drew.
Hey, I, uh...

21:33.393 --> 21:34.625
I found out what the holdup is.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.527
What?

21:36.528 --> 21:38.428
Brianna's birth father has
come back into the picture.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.498
He says he wants full custody.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.700
No. What... He can't...
He can't do that.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.502
He gave up his parental rights.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.304
Yeah.
Not technically, okay?

21:46.306 --> 21:49.073
He claims that the birth mother
never told him about Brianna,

21:49.075 --> 21:50.875
that he just found out about her
six months ago,

21:50.877 --> 21:52.576
and he has been looking for her
ever since.

21:52.578 --> 21:54.378
She's 14 years old.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.048
I mean, he can't...
He can't stake a claim on her

21:57.050 --> 21:58.549
after all these years, can he?
He can't...

21:58.551 --> 21:59.984
It's up to the court, Drew.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.520
But he can keep you
from getting her now.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.089
And he's on his way here.
I'm so sorry.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.126
I really appreciate this, man.

22:09.127 --> 22:10.760
I-I wouldn't ask for this loan
if it wasn't important, man.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.029
I-I just can't lose
my business.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.497
Yeah, it's fine.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.964
It's just sitting
in my savings account anyway.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.734
Not like I'm making anything
off the interest.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.436
I'll pay you back
as soon as I can. I swear.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.704
Yeah, don't... don't even
worry about it.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.038
I'll write you a check
after work, all right?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.707
Um, but, hey, I got to...
I got to go. All right?

22:22.709 --> 22:24.608
Hey, how were the test results
for your patient?

22:24.610 --> 22:26.610
Exactly what I expected.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.646
She's still awake,
but her respiratory rate is up.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.648
She's probably acidotic
from intestinal ischemia.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.216
Hey, hey, slow down, all right?

22:32.217 --> 22:33.783
You're trying to make
your original diagnosis fit.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.920
There could be multiple causes
for rapid breathing, okay?

22:35.922 --> 22:38.956
This woman doesn't have time
for possible or probable, Paul.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.425
I-I just drew an ABG
to see for sure!

22:41.427 --> 22:42.760
Why are you so upset?

22:42.762 --> 22:44.362
You asked for <i> my</i> help,

22:44.363 --> 22:45.963
and I made a medical call
based on my experience.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.698
And you completely ignored mine.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.066
I just know more.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.052
Look... Look,
I-I understand,

22:51.053 --> 22:53.037
with the pending hospital sale,
that you're scared, okay?

22:53.039 --> 22:54.505
Do you understand that, Paul?

22:54.507 --> 22:56.006
Do you understand
living in a trailer

22:56.008 --> 22:58.542
until they take you away because
you haven't eaten for days?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.511
Watching all your friends
drop out or die?

23:00.513 --> 23:02.029
People laughing at you

23:02.030 --> 23:03.546
because you dare to dream
of something more?!

23:03.549 --> 23:05.116
Shannon,
I-I want to understand.

23:05.118 --> 23:08.419
I do. I-I know that you had
a terrible upbringing...

23:08.421 --> 23:09.820
Upbringing? See?!

23:09.822 --> 23:12.523
You can't understand.
Listen to how you speak!

23:12.525 --> 23:15.493
We are two very different people
from two very different worlds.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.062
And if this hospital shuts down,
I go back to mine.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.497
It's...
It's not gonna close, okay?

23:19.499 --> 23:21.799
Stop saying that!
You don't know that!

23:21.801 --> 23:23.834
Just because everything
works out for you

23:23.836 --> 23:25.436
doesn't mean it will for me.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.788
That's not what I mean, okay?

23:26.789 --> 23:28.139
There... There... There are
things happening...

23:28.141 --> 23:29.907
You know what?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.674
My gut told me I never
should have started

23:31.677 --> 23:33.978
anything with you,
and it was right.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.713
What does that mean?

23:35.715 --> 23:37.648
It means we're through.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.084
So let's just focus on Valeska

23:40.086 --> 23:43.120
and get through the rest
of the shift, okay?

24:03.509 --> 24:05.643
That's nine dead.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.611
Two more in the last hour.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.648
How's Sahin?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.616
I can't get her fever down.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.886
B.P. is holding, but her
heart rate is dropping.

24:15.888 --> 24:19.089
That's strange. It should be
elevated with a fever.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.758
Take a look at this rash.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.628
You thinking what I'm thinking?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.063
Typhus.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.198
Yep.
Has to be.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.699
Yeah. Right.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.668
Typhus is bacterial.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.903
Spread by mites, fleas,
and ticks,

24:32.905 --> 24:34.772
with an incubation period
of 10 days.

24:34.774 --> 24:35.973
The Kurds just arrived today,

24:35.975 --> 24:37.675
so they couldn't have infected
the camp.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.109
They must have contracted it
elsewhere.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.846
This entire region
could be infected.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.950
Shit.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.920
Typhus?

24:49.922 --> 24:52.656
Typhus, it is...
It is worse than malaria?

24:54.660 --> 24:55.926
Yes.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.795
We were prepared for malaria.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.964
We don't have enough meds
for a typhus outbreak.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.673
Hey, man.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.208
Welcome back.

25:12.812 --> 25:16.213
So, you got a piece of that trap
stuck in your lung.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.148
We got it out just in time.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.617
You're gonna be fine.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.519
When can I get back out there?

25:21.521 --> 25:22.686
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.054
Easy.
Easy, easy, easy.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.156
You just had
open-chest surgery.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.758
You're gonna have to relax
for a while.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.226
The animals will have to wait
a few weeks.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.262
Oh, but they can't, though.

25:31.264 --> 25:33.230
If I'm not out there
doing my part, who will?

25:33.232 --> 25:35.633
You guys are doctors, right?

25:35.635 --> 25:37.235
Mm-hmm.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.836
Like, what if someone
told you to relax,

25:38.838 --> 25:40.838
saving lives could wait?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.773
- Huh?
- Look.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.142
- I admire your passion.
- Yeah.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.011
- But you...
- No, you think I'm a joke.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.212
- No.
- No.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.147
- Yeah, a little bit.
- No, I don't.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.783
Derrick, you believe
in something, all right,

25:52.785 --> 25:53.984
and you fight for it.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.719
I admire that in a person.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.855
That's very sweet of you.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.758
Look, Derrick, if you go out
there right now, you'd die.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.543
And like you just said,

26:02.544 --> 26:04.327
if you're not out there
doing your work, who's gonna?

26:04.330 --> 26:07.998
Best thing you can do right now
is rest and heal up.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.266
Okay?

26:09.268 --> 26:11.335
Man.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.337
Okay.
Is everybody accounted for?

26:13.339 --> 26:15.139
Hey, I'm out of here, all right?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.574
- Hold on.
- The flames jumped the fire break.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.008
I'm not gonna sit here
while you're jerking me around

26:18.010 --> 26:19.477
if you're not gonna sign
this damn form.

26:19.478 --> 26:20.945
Okay, hold on. I'm just waiting
to get your C.T. scan results.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.179
Nah, I don't have time for that,
all right?

26:22.181 --> 26:23.280
My team's shorthanded.
They need me.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.533
- I'll see you, Doc.
- Wait. Fine.

26:25.534 --> 26:27.785
I'll check your scan and I'll...
I'll e-mail you the signed form.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.887
You got to promise to come
right back if it's abnormal.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.156
Yeah, deal.
H-Hey, anybody getting off soon?

26:32.158 --> 26:33.290
They're setting up a triage area

26:33.292 --> 26:34.758
outside the fire to deal
with patients.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.926
We could use a doc or two.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.278
I can't leave tonight,

26:37.279 --> 26:38.629
not until I hand the shift off
to the Day Chief.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.965
- I can go.
- You... You sure?

26:40.967 --> 26:42.633
Yeah, I could use
a change of pace.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.835
I'm off call in 20 minutes,
so I can go, too.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.704
Can always use another surgeon
out there.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.005
Sounds good to me.
Topher?

26:48.006 --> 26:49.305
- Okay, just be careful.
- All right. Grab your gear.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.307
- Let's go.
- All right.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.342
Scott.

26:51.344 --> 26:53.077
Do you have to go?

26:53.079 --> 26:54.395
Like, I feel like you're

26:54.396 --> 26:55.712
the only person here
who believes me.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.147
Well, yeah, I do.
I have to go.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.650
- They need me out there.
- With Jordan?

26:59.652 --> 27:02.319
Annie, we're working triage
at a fire,

27:02.321 --> 27:04.188
not doing dinner and a movie.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.923
I'll see you when I get back.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.960
He's a stranger.
I-I don't want to meet him.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.663
I know.
But you have to.

27:12.665 --> 27:16.033
But I'm not gonna live
with him, right?

27:16.035 --> 27:17.901
I'm gonna be, uh,
with you and Rick,

27:17.903 --> 27:20.070
because... because that's what
you guys said.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.406
You guys said that
you would adopt me,

27:22.408 --> 27:24.942
and... and I'm not gonna
have to live with him.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.343
Don't I have any say in this?

27:26.345 --> 27:28.646
Yes, you have a say in this.

27:28.648 --> 27:31.682
You can tell the judge
exactly what you want.

27:31.684 --> 27:35.085
But, in the end, it's...
It's just not up to you.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.854
What?

27:36.856 --> 27:38.756
Wh...

27:41.060 --> 27:43.694
I'm so stupid.

27:43.696 --> 27:47.798
I actually... I actually
believed you guys.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.335
Hey.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.171
Why did you lie to me?

27:55.941 --> 27:57.841
Any pressure in your abdomen?

27:57.843 --> 27:59.043
Maybe.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.711
It just... feels tight.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.180
Like, har...
Harder to breathe.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.848
Paged me?

28:04.850 --> 28:06.717
Look, her ABG just came back.

28:06.719 --> 28:07.918
Her pH is way down.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.253
She's got acid in her blood.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.287
I told you.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.423
I can't breathe.

28:12.425 --> 28:13.724
She's crashing.

28:13.726 --> 28:14.814
All right.
She needs surgery.

28:14.815 --> 28:15.903
Swelling will suffocate
her organs.

28:15.904 --> 28:16.992
- I'll page Scott.
- Scott's in the field,

28:16.996 --> 28:18.462
and the day-shift doctor's
on his way.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.864
I'll do it.
Let's go.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.100
27 doses of Cipro.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.703
Gonna need 10 times that amount
to treat the typhus in camp.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.371
Okay, well, there's more coming
with the resupply.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.373
But until then, we have to
decide who gets the medication.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.075
If you and I get sick,
we can't treat anybody,

28:31.077 --> 28:32.910
so we got to be top priority.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.245
There's four aside for us.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.949
Okay, and there's two for Hamdi,
Besam, and Sahin.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.155
I don't think Sahin
should get any.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.224
She's in bad shape, T.C.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.093
I know.
But I think, at this point,

28:49.095 --> 28:50.494
the medication
won't do her any good.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.029
And even if she does get better,

28:52.031 --> 28:54.164
she's not likely to make it
all the way to Germany.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.500
What, so basically we're saying
that all the sacrifices

28:56.502 --> 28:58.368
she made to come this far
don't matter.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.370
You're pulling a family apart.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.805
No.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.239
A family divided is better
than no family at all.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.341
You didn't even want to let them

29:04.343 --> 29:05.476
into the camp
in the first place.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.211
Well, they're here now.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.379
We can't turn our back on them.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.884
Look, when resupply comes
at the end of the day,

29:13.886 --> 29:15.052
Sahin can get the meds.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.854
<i>If</i> she's still here to get them.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.889
Hopefully she will be.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.543
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.445
Can you call Topher and have him
send in some more supplies?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.430
Fire took out
the cellphone tower.

29:43.431 --> 29:45.414
We got no reception.
I'll find you a walkie.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.517
Hey, come over here!

29:46.519 --> 29:49.119
- It's not me, man. It's Rene.
- Rene?

29:49.121 --> 29:51.321
Rocks came loose.
She fell off a ledge.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.856
I think she broke her leg.
She can't move.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.158
- I tried to help her.
- Okay, where is she?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.459
- I tried to help her, man.
- Where is she?

29:55.461 --> 29:57.528
She's like a mile off...
Off the trail that way.

29:57.530 --> 29:58.779
I can show you.

29:58.780 --> 30:00.029
No, no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.231
We need oxygen.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.800
- Let's go. Oxygen!
- Okay.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.268
I can carry her,
but if her leg is broken...

30:04.270 --> 30:05.469
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Come on. Move.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.204
Hey.
Then I'm coming, too.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.106
Let's go.
Double time.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.342
Sun's up in an hour, and the
winds will pick up with it.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.148
Okay.
This is the last of it.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.851
Rest of the intestine
looks viable.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.953
All right.
Clamp, please.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.389
Her O2 levels are dropping.

30:25.391 --> 30:26.957
That doesn't make any sense.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.892
- Is she still bleeding?
- Uh, no.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.194
No. No.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.995
No breath sounds
on the right side.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.597
It's pneumothorax.
She has a punctured lung.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.266
Hand me an 18-gauge angiocath
to needle her chest.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.401
You didn't see this
on the x-ray?

30:37.403 --> 30:38.569
No, I...

30:38.571 --> 30:40.170
If you put even a small pneumo
on a vent,

30:40.172 --> 30:41.972
it can kill the patient.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.313
O2 levels are back up.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.582
I'm sorry.
I didn't see that.

30:51.584 --> 30:53.884
That's why we trust the people
we consult with.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.552
Everybody makes mistakes.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.055
Probably not the only one
you made tonight, Doctor.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.958
I can close her by myself.
You can go now.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.500
Damn it.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.637
Hey, Moss.
Hey, not a good time.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.973
Hey, hey, take it easy.

31:15.975 --> 31:19.943
I'm talking about
work-wise here. Okay?

31:19.945 --> 31:23.247
No, I'm... I'm not trying
to disrespect you.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.982
Listen... Listen.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.050
Listen, I got...
I got your 5 grand.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.953
Yeah.
Yeah, tomorrow.

31:29.955 --> 31:34.324
Hey. Hey.
Drink. You need the fluids.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.461
You okay?

31:37.463 --> 31:39.263
Yeah, I'm just a...
little light-headed.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.931
I might need some air.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.401
What... What's this?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.036
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.010
You gave her your pills,
didn't you?

31:53.012 --> 31:55.112
- She needed the medicine, T.C.
- Are you kidding me?

31:55.114 --> 31:57.347
You give me a lecture
about being reckless,

31:57.349 --> 31:58.582
and you pull this crap?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.918
I made a decision, okay?

32:00.920 --> 32:02.085
Yeah, the wrong one.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.254
How could you be so selfish?

32:04.256 --> 32:06.023
I couldn't sit around and watch

32:06.025 --> 32:07.557
that man lose his grandmother.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.393
Okay, you may be all right
with tearing a family apart,

32:09.395 --> 32:10.661
but I'm not.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.229
And what happens
when you get too sick

32:12.231 --> 32:14.097
to help these other people?

32:14.099 --> 32:16.566
I will be able to hold out
until the resupply comes.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.535
Sahin wouldn't have
been able to.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.371
Let me do my job,
and you do yours.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.374
Haven't been able
to get ahold of...

32:24.376 --> 32:26.476
What are you doing?

32:26.477 --> 32:28.577
- What do you think?
- You can't do this.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.047
Yes, I can.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.315
No, no. I-I mean
<i>you</i> can't do this.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.582
Yes, I can.

32:32.584 --> 32:33.873
Look, people aren't jumping ship

32:33.874 --> 32:35.163
so we can be together, man,
because we're a family.

32:35.164 --> 32:36.453
Searching and going through
people's lockers,

32:36.455 --> 32:38.288
man, that ain't family.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.122
But the fact is somebody
committed a felony.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.292
Somebody took these pills.
We're responsible.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.361
Try getting a new job
with that on your record!

32:44.363 --> 32:46.196
I thought you said there's
still another chance.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.638
Still another buyer
out there, right?

32:49.435 --> 32:51.201
Well, yeah.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.736
There is.
I'm...

32:52.738 --> 32:54.237
Toph, come on.

32:54.239 --> 32:57.140
We have to believe in the family
we created or...

32:57.142 --> 32:58.542
what's the point, man?

32:58.544 --> 33:00.377
Yeah, you're right.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.645
We'll use security.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.314
If they deny us,
we know something is up.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.415
All right.

33:17.062 --> 33:20.030
- So, you and T.C. a thing?
- What?

33:20.032 --> 33:22.432
The jacket.
It says "Callahan."

33:22.434 --> 33:24.101
That's T.C., right?

33:24.103 --> 33:25.569
Figured you two were dating
or something.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.204
Nah, I just forgot
my field jacket today,

33:27.206 --> 33:28.472
so I borrowed one
from his locker.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.774
It's getting pretty hairy
up here, Mac.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.076
- If we don't find her soon...
- No, no, no.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.678
We're not leaving without her.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.282
You okay?
Yeah.

33:39.284 --> 33:41.518
Fine.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.487
Topher, here.

33:43.489 --> 33:46.790
I know everybody thinks it's me,
so I took a drug test.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.358
Jocelyn witnessed it.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.693
- I did.
- Okay, look, Annie...

33:49.695 --> 33:50.794
- And I will pass it.
- You know what?

33:50.796 --> 33:52.563
Let's deal with this tomorrow.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.764
Right now, I think the best
thing is for you to go home.

33:57.770 --> 33:59.436
Fine.

33:59.438 --> 34:00.570
I'll go.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.372
But you listen to me.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.508
Scott and T.C.
won't be happy.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.176
And there's gonna be
hell to pay.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.411
Annie.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.818
Hey.
This the call?

34:14.820 --> 34:16.386
Our last chance and savior?

34:16.388 --> 34:17.521
This is it, brother.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.424
Hello?

34:20.426 --> 34:22.492
Yeah.

34:24.830 --> 34:29.232
No, but, you... <i>you</i> said
the numbers look good.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.440
What, so that...
That's it?

34:37.443 --> 34:39.443
Can't you talk to the board?

34:39.445 --> 34:43.146
I don't know.
Take another look.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.083
Yeah.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.851
Oh, I get it.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.588
Fine. Forget it.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.096
Damn it!

35:02.534 --> 35:04.401
Mother...

35:08.607 --> 35:10.574
What was... What was that
all about?

35:10.576 --> 35:12.642
All our jobs going out the door.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.826
There she is!
Rene!

35:36.235 --> 35:38.335
Sleeping on the job again,
eh, Rene?

35:38.337 --> 35:40.454
I'm just tired
from pulling your weight.

35:40.455 --> 35:42.572
That's why I brought backup...
Takes two to replace you.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.740
How you feeling?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.542
I've been better.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.278
Rene. I'm Dr. Alexander.
This is Dr. Clemmens.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.779
Hey.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.414
Sorry, but we're gonna have
to move your leg.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.216
- All right.
- You tell me when you're ready.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.518
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You good?

35:54.520 --> 35:55.719
Mm-hmm.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.223
- Aah!
- There you go. You got it.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.792
Can you tell me
how this happened?

36:02.794 --> 36:05.195
Stupid rocks came out
from under me.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.164
I went tumbling like
Humpty Dumpty

36:07.166 --> 36:08.665
and I...
I can't walk on my leg.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.267
How's the pain?

36:10.269 --> 36:13.203
Feels like pins and needles,
but I-I can take it.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.539
No distal pulse.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.308
And her compartments feel tense.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.977
What does that mean?

36:19.978 --> 36:21.645
The swelling from the fracture
is cutting off blood flow.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.464
- Can you fix it?
- Not here.

36:23.465 --> 36:25.282
We need to get her back down to
triage so we can do surgery.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.350
Let's get her up and get her
the hell out of here.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.455
It's called a colostomy bag.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.558
I'm sorry.
It was part of the injury.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.526
You'll have to go
to the bathroom in it

36:36.528 --> 36:37.827
for the rest of your life.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.497
That sucks.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.299
But, hey, a few hours ago,

36:42.301 --> 36:44.601
it was quitting the department
or even dying,

36:44.603 --> 36:47.704
so... I'll take poop in a bag
any day.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.574
- You are one cool, tough chick.
- So are you.

36:50.576 --> 36:51.841
Thanks again for everything.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.229
Just remember, I love you.

37:20.639 --> 37:23.340
All right.

37:23.342 --> 37:26.509
Drew, this is Brianna's father.

37:26.511 --> 37:29.746
Hi. Justin.
Nice to meet you.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.748
Dr.
Alister.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.883
I've been taking care of Brianna
for the past couple months.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.852
Here.
By her side.

37:35.854 --> 37:38.021
You?
Where have you been?

37:38.023 --> 37:39.656
Drew.
Look, I'm...

37:39.658 --> 37:41.491
I'm not some deadbeat dad
who ran out on her.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.293
I never knew I had a daughter.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.028
Her mother never contacted me.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.630
I-I just found out about Brianna
a few months ago,

37:46.632 --> 37:48.031
and I'm here now.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.834
So you're doing this more
out of curiosity than...

37:50.836 --> 37:52.602
No. I'm her father,
and I want her in my life.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.437
This is crazy. We don't know
if he's really her father.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.839
- Relax.
- I'll take a DNA test.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.841
Whatever it takes.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.342
I just want to meet my daughter.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.944
Please.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.412
Of course.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.781
Right this way.

38:04.783 --> 38:09.319
If you hurt her even a little bit...

38:15.894 --> 38:18.662
So I heard your White Knight
didn't come through, huh?

38:18.664 --> 38:19.996
No, it did not.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.832
Uh, maybe that wasn't
your best play?

38:22.834 --> 38:24.467
Paul, I'm really not in the mood

38:24.469 --> 38:26.336
for Monday morning
quarterbacking, okay?

38:26.338 --> 38:28.004
It's easy to sit here and judge,

38:28.006 --> 38:30.407
seeing how you and Scott
are gonna be fine.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.742
Sorry.
I-I came out here to tell you,

38:32.744 --> 38:34.611
I spoke to my dad
about a week ago,

38:34.613 --> 38:35.945
when all this started happening.

38:35.947 --> 38:39.382
My family is part of a huge fund
that buys hospitals.

38:39.384 --> 38:42.519
What? How come you didn't say
anything before?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.721
I didn't want to get yours
or anyone else's hopes up.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.623
But it's a big group.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.092
They bought St. John's
in... in Denver.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.695
And another in Phoenix
and Chicago.

38:51.697 --> 38:55.665
And my dad is on a plane.
He'll be here in about an hour.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.567
Are you serious?!
Yeah.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.369
But you will have to
sell him on it.

38:59.371 --> 39:01.905
You know, make him see why we
need to keep this place open.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.540
I don't know what to say, Paul!

39:03.542 --> 39:04.774
Thank... Thank you!

39:04.776 --> 39:06.843
Yeah. Okay.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.649
Hey.
Syd, hey.

39:12.651 --> 39:13.717
You shouldn't be out here.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.118
These people need help.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.753
I can handle it for now.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.658
It's our...
It's our supplies.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.527
Perfect timing.

39:24.529 --> 39:25.829
Look, now you will please
go in and lie down?

39:25.831 --> 39:27.791
- I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Please? I got this.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.105
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Syd!

39:35.107 --> 39:36.573
That's not good.

39:39.111 --> 39:41.444
Hey, Doctor, is this
our medicine?

39:41.446 --> 39:43.413
- Yeah.
- How will we get it now?!

39:43.415 --> 39:44.681
They won't let us
cross the border!

39:44.683 --> 39:45.815
I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.984
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I'm an aid worker.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.786
I need to get across.
I need to get our resupply.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.821
- Get back.
- You have to open the gate for me.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.056
- Get back!
- Our supplies are over there.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.058
Now!

39:56.628 --> 39:58.995
We have to get our supplies,
okay?!

39:58.997 --> 40:00.563
Get back, all of you!

40:02.467 --> 40:04.947
I'm an aid worker. My new warning
is get back or we will shoot.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.174
Okay! Okay!

40:15.580 --> 40:17.914
Okay, okay.
We got to go inside.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.051
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.760
Hang in there, Rene.
You doing good?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.962
Good as a 30-year Scotch
and a rib eye.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.564
Once we're out of this,
I got just the place.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.999
Hey, whoa.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.001
Damn it, the wind shifted.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.510
- What's going on?
- The trail's cut off up ahead.

40:47.512 --> 40:48.878
Well, we'll just double back.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.980
Nothing behind us but more fire.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.515
We're blocked in
on east and west.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.651
Well, what's the plan, Mac?

40:54.653 --> 40:57.454
Deploy the fire shelters
and wait.

40:57.456 --> 40:58.588
Wait for what?

40:58.590 --> 41:00.223
For it to pass over us.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.225
Mac's right.
We've got to do it.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.893
Look, it's our only choice,
all right? We're out of time.

41:03.895 --> 41:06.796
- Let's go.
- Okay.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.531
Get the tent sealed
to the ground.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.133
Get your face down there.
The air is cooler.

41:10.135 --> 41:11.601
Okay.

41:11.603 --> 41:12.635
I got you, Rene.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.037
I know you do.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.639
All right, come on!
Come on, let's go!

41:16.641 --> 41:18.975
Come on. Hurry up!
Move it!

41:18.977 --> 41:20.477
We only got a few seconds!

41:23.181 --> 41:26.216
Stay low.
Don't come out until I tell you.

41:27.953 --> 41:30.053
Scott, if we don't make it,
I really want you to...

41:30.055 --> 41:32.622
No, we will, Jordan,
I promise you.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.691
But if we don't,
I want you to know...

41:34.693 --> 41:37.160
Here we go!
Hang on!
