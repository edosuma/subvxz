We resolved it.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.433
- I didn't feel truthful today
to Dorit.

37:57.467 --> 37:59.033
- I don't want to go
to a bad place.

37:59.066 --> 38:00.467
- It's nothing about you and I,

38:00.500 --> 38:02.367
but I found out information.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.734
For over a week
I never mentioned it.

38:04.767 --> 38:07.166
And then when we went
into Vanderpump Dogs,

38:07.200 --> 38:12.500
John pranced your dog out
and told me and Kyle.

38:14.133 --> 38:15.400
- Coming up...

38:15.433 --> 38:16.633
- I'm your friend, Lisa.

38:16.667 --> 38:19.000
- I had no idea Teddi
would be gossiping.

38:19.033 --> 38:20.600
- I never told a soul.
- Hold on a sec--

38:20.633 --> 38:23.100
- But--no, no.
Let me finish.

38:29.066 --> 38:29.367
- When we went

38:29.367 --> 38:31.033
- When we went
into Vanderpump Dogs,

38:32.300 --> 38:34.233
John pranced your dog out
and told me and Kyle.

You're the only person
that speaks to John Blizzard.

38:38.600 --> 38:42.066
- It was not my fault
that this is out there.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.533
This situation
could have been resolved

38:43.567 --> 38:46.033

and Dorit.

38:46.066 --> 38:47.233

never known about it.

- Hi, how are you?

38:48.600 --> 38:50.567

in the kennel shelter.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.266

whatever, the gossip,

but I would never
do anything to Dorit.

38:59.700 --> 39:04.100

but keep your hands clean.

Period.
End of story.

I have 400 employees.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.700
I can't be responsible
for everything they do and say.

39:14.734 --> 39:17.000
- Yeah, you can.
Vanderpump Dogs, baby.

39:17.033 --> 39:18.266
- I actually can't.

39:18.300 --> 39:19.767

this dog?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.667
Does this dog look
familiar to you?"

39:21.700 --> 39:23.100
- Suddenly everybody's
attacking me.

39:23.133 --> 39:24.433
What have I done?

39:25.467 --> 39:25.700
I had nothing to do with
any of this.

39:26.567 --> 39:27.533
I tried to protect Dorit.

39:27.567 --> 39:28.667
Oh, my God.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.133
If Dorit had just handled
it properly,

39:30.166 --> 39:33.000
there wouldn't
be this scenario.

39:33.033 --> 39:34.500
- The only thing
we ever said was,

39:34.533 --> 39:37.100
"Why didn't Dorit
feel comfortable to tell Lisa

39:37.133 --> 39:39.500
that it was happening prior
to it happening," or whatever--

39:39.533 --> 39:40.700
- I did tell Lisa.

39:40.734 --> 39:41.734
- Afterwards,
but it doesn't matter.

39:41.767 --> 39:43.500
- I talked to Lisa
the day after.

39:43.533 --> 39:45.166
I gave it to what I believed

39:45.200 --> 39:49.100
was a wonderful home,
because Lucy bit my children.

39:49.133 --> 39:51.200
- I'm lost.
- Okay.

39:51.233 --> 39:52.734
It's about a dog catcher, um...

39:54.266 --> 39:55.567
- I don't even know what these
bitches are fighting about.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.500
[laughs]

39:57.533 --> 40:01.033
I cannot follow it at all.

40:01.066 --> 40:05.033
- It's so unfair that I somehow
was villainized in this.

40:05.066 --> 40:06.633
- They were just upset...
-And they went behind my back--

40:06.667 --> 40:09.700
- Because somehow
the dog ended up in the shelter.

40:09.734 --> 40:11.166
- Yeah, but that wasn't
Dorit's fault,

40:11.200 --> 40:12.633
because Dorit told me
the story,

40:12.667 --> 40:14.500
and I know that
her intent was good.

40:14.533 --> 40:17.133
- Here I am thinking that she's
going to this beautiful home.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.066
I get a phone call from Lisa

40:19.100 --> 40:21.600
that Lucy ended up
in a shelter.

40:21.633 --> 40:23.600
- She did not
give this dog away...

40:23.633 --> 40:25.333
- 1,000%.
- Knowing that this dog was

40:25.367 --> 40:27.066
gonna drive a wedge
in your relationship.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.333
- I'm your friend, Lisa.

40:28.367 --> 40:30.734
- I wanted to shut it down,
Dorit.

40:30.767 --> 40:33.066
- Lisa, why aren't you
upset about this?

40:33.100 --> 40:35.667
- Oh, come on.
- He's your employee!

40:35.700 --> 40:39.200
This wouldn't get out there if
you didn't want it out there.

40:39.233 --> 40:42.633
This is, like, bullsh--, going
to Teddi, bringing Kyle in.

40:42.667 --> 40:44.333
This sounds like
a ----ing setup.

40:44.367 --> 40:47.133
- I was--are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

40:47.166 --> 40:48.633
I'm wondering
if Vanderpump's slipping,

40:48.667 --> 40:51.266
because it's so ----ing obvious.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.300
I think you set them up.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.133
People call her manipulative

40:55.166 --> 40:57.767
and a puppet master
and all that stuff.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.567
- Well, you can believe that.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.300
- I'm a little worried
about her.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.266
She's ----ing slipping.

41:03.300 --> 41:06.166
- You knew full well
how that would make me look.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.367
And I'm your friend.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.633
- I don't believe for a second
you were guilty

41:10.667 --> 41:12.300
of giving the dog to anybody

41:12.333 --> 41:14.166
but what you thought
was a great home.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.700
I don't believe that.
However,

41:17.734 --> 41:21.100
it all went wrong.

41:21.133 --> 41:23.300
And you should have given
the dog back to me, I suppose.

Don't get upset.

Everyone knows
you're a good person.

You had no bad intentions.
You hear me?

41:31.767 --> 41:35.233
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
You don't deserve this.

41:35.266 --> 41:36.734
- Why is Dorit upset?

41:36.767 --> 41:38.633
- You know why.
- Why?

41:38.667 --> 41:41.667
- She's acting like she's
so confused why Dorit's upset.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.000
- I would love to say
I'm shocked, but I'm not.

41:44.033 --> 41:45.400
- Honey, listen to me.

41:45.433 --> 41:47.400
You don't deserve it.
No one deserves this.

41:47.433 --> 41:49.133

- I love Lisa, but that
doesn't mean I'm blind.

41:55.667 --> 41:57.133
Well, we're your friends too.

41:57.166 --> 41:59.300
Someone dropping a dog off

41:59.333 --> 42:02.133
at a shelter would be
very upsetting to Lisa.

42:02.166 --> 42:04.734
And I think she wanted
to punish her a little

42:04.767 --> 42:06.266
while trying to look innocent,

42:06.300 --> 42:08.033
because she wants to protect
her relationship

42:08.066 --> 42:10.400
with Dorit at the same time.

42:10.433 --> 42:12.000
- It's a betrayal.

42:12.033 --> 42:13.400
- [sniffs] Oh, my God...

42:13.433 --> 42:15.400
- Why didn't Dorit just
call you and say the dog's...

42:15.433 --> 42:17.400
- But that's the point.
That's exactly what--

42:17.433 --> 42:18.367
- Why doesn't Dorit,
like, trust you?

42:19.400 --> 42:19.700
- Instead of trying
to find someone--

42:21.133 --> 42:22.066
- She could just say,
"The dog's biting my kids.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.333
I can't have the dog."

42:23.367 --> 42:24.667
You would understand that.
- Exactly.

42:24.700 --> 42:27.033
- This should never have
left anyone's mouth.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.333
- Yes.

42:28.367 --> 42:30.300
- Your employee should never
have said anything.

42:30.333 --> 42:32.100
That, I--I agree with that.

Don't turn this around on me.

42:45.433 --> 42:46.166
- How did he tell you
when he told you?

42:47.166 --> 42:47.734
- It doesn't matter
how he told me.

42:49.033 --> 42:49.734
- Okay. All right.
- It's how he told us.

42:51.266 --> 42:53.300
- Exactly. That is an agenda.
- It's not fair to me.
