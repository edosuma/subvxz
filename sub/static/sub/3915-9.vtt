NARRATOR:
Previously on Beauty and the Beast:

00:03.680 --> 00:05.682
- Liam sent you.
- Who is Liam?

00:05.840 --> 00:08.810
He tricked me into making him
superhuman, but I escaped,

00:08.960 --> 00:12.009
and I have been trying to figure out
how to stop him ever since.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.731
And now you have to.
You're the only one who has a chance.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.730
You're getting married tomorrow.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.008
And nothing is gonna stand
in the way of that, okay?

00:24.600 --> 00:26.443
Right now, quickly! Go!

00:30.840 --> 00:33.047
- Talk to me. Are you okay?
- Where'd he go?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.725
He's gone.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:56.880 --> 00:58.325
Hey.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.247
- Did you get any sleep last night?
- Barely.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.006
- You?
- No.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.484
- Want some coffee?
- I'd love some.

01:08.240 --> 01:12.040
- Are you gonna get stitches?
- No. No, I don't really need them.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.404
Come on, you going to work today?

01:16.560 --> 01:19.450
Yeah. Yeah, Tess is under fire
trying to explain why

01:19.600 --> 01:22.331
Julianna was murdered
at our wedding, so...

01:22.480 --> 01:25.768
Right. Which is why we need
to track Liam together, and fast.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.288
Vincent, I meant what I said last night.
I don't want to go after him.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.681
- This isn't our responsibility.
- How can you say that?

01:31.840 --> 01:34.605
Not only did he kill Julianna,
he completely destroyed our wedding.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.683
And he needs to be caught
and brought to justice,

01:36.840 --> 01:38.251
just like every other murderer.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.164
He's not just like
every other murderer, okay?

01:40.320 --> 01:42.243
You know it.
You have seen what he can do.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.562
Yeah, I saw that he almost
killed both of us,

01:44.720 --> 01:48.361
and I'm not willing to risk that anymore.
This isn't our fight.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.490
How come you've been saying it is
for the last few months?

01:52.640 --> 01:56.122
Okay, and now I finally believe it,
so, come on, what's changed?

01:56.280 --> 01:59.124
What's changed is that I know what
we're really up against now, and...

01:59.280 --> 02:02.648
I'm scared.
This was a huge mistake.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.928
Okay, yes, I get it, okay?

02:05.080 --> 02:06.445
But those DHS agents--

02:06.600 --> 02:08.806
Were wrong to ask us
to get involved in the first place.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.726
I didn't see it then, but you did,
Vincent, and you were right.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.805
We fought Muirfield, beasts, Gabe,
and it should've stopped there.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.042
This is... This is too much.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.680
Okay, well, try telling that
to the innocents that we've saved,

02:21.840 --> 02:24.241
okay, because DHS put us
on this case.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.289
- Isn't this what we do?
- Yes.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.887
We save innocent people every day,
you as a doctor and rne as a cop.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.327
And in order for me
to keep doing that,

02:32.480 --> 02:35.404
I've gotta help Tess solve this
like a regular police case,

02:35.560 --> 02:37.642
so we can get back to helping
the people we can help.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.691
Hey, what did you say to me
when I first proposed to you?

02:42.440 --> 02:44.602
That you thought that we were
part of something bigger.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.082
- Something just like this, right?
- I was wrong, okay?

02:48.240 --> 02:53.007
Maybe... Maybe I just wanted
to make a difference so badly

02:53.160 --> 02:56.528
that I was willing to believe whatever
it is DHS wanted me to believe.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.160
That this was our fight.
And it's not, Vincent.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.402
This is way over our heads.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.289
I'm done.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.050
<i>J.T .:
What do you mean, she's done?</i>

03:11.200 --> 03:15.489
Done, like, you mean, with Liam?
Or done, like, with everything?

03:15.640 --> 03:16.641
With everything.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.962
If it's anything other than
a police case,

03:19.120 --> 03:22.090
Catherine doesn't want to
have anything to do with it anymore.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.720
Yeah, well, can't really blame her.

03:25.560 --> 03:30.122
I'm just saying, you guys have done
a lot, you know? For a long time.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.566
Lucky we're all still alive.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.768
Yeah, well, that's exactly her point,
you know?

03:33.920 --> 03:35.649
She doesn't want to risk it anymore,

03:35.800 --> 03:38.690
especially after what happened
at the wedding.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.842
Again, you can't really blame her.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.445
Come on, man,
whose side are you on?

03:42.600 --> 03:44.204
Your side, our side, but, you know,

03:44.360 --> 03:46.488
it's not like her argument
doesn't have merit.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.926
Yeah, I know, I know, it's just...

03:50.080 --> 03:54.130
Julianna turned this Liam guy
into some kind of superhuman,

03:54.280 --> 03:57.841
and then she died trying to stop him
by experimenting on other innocents.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.287
It's crazy. If we're the only ones
who know about it,

04:00.440 --> 04:03.603
- then we can't just walk away, right?
- I know, I'm on your side, I get it.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.604
The only thing I don't get is
what changed for Cat.

04:06.760 --> 04:11.800
I mean, I didn't buy into this whole
destiny spiel of hers at first, but...

04:11.960 --> 04:14.042
- I do now.
- Yeah, well, so do I.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.647
- Problem is, now Catherine doesn't.
- She's probably just overreacting.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.644
It's understandable.
She'll come around. She has to.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.451
Yeah, well, I can't wait.
You know, I gotta try and find Liam

04:23.600 --> 04:25.443
before his trail goes completely cold.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.409
You try beast-tracking him
from the church?

04:27.560 --> 04:29.642
Yeah. Obviously he knows
how to cover his tracks.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.926
[SIGHS]

04:31.840 --> 04:33.842
How's this serum
of Julianna's coming along?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.482
Well, I'm not having much luck
separating the superhuman paris

04:37.640 --> 04:39.642
from the
"you'll go crazy and die" pads.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.041
And if I can't, it'll be too risky
to inject into you.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.204
Well, maybe I won't even need it
to stop Liam, right?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.522
- Julianna said you would.
- Julianna didn't know me.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.331
Besides, I'm still here.
I haven't lost a fight yet, have I?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.883
Not with Cat by your side.

04:53.040 --> 04:57.841
Yeah, well, let's hope she does
what you say and she comes around.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.650
Where are you going?

05:00.280 --> 05:03.682
To try and figure out another way
to track this Liam guy.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.684
No, we haven't found
any suspects yet.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.286
But it's only been 24 hours
since Julianna was murdered.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.330
A half dozen chiefs and assistant chiefs
were at that wedding. Understand?

05:11.480 --> 05:14.370
- They want answers. I want answers.
- And I will get them for you, chief.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.922
- But it's gonna take time.
- You don't have time, Tess. Captain.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.807
A fugitive was murdered there,
your fugitive.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.724
In a minute,
the press will be all over this.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.484
If the department doesn't
have suspects--

05:24.640 --> 05:25.641
We have a board going.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.883
I'm filling it with anybody who might've
had motive to kill Julianna Keaton.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.130
That's not good enough, damn it.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.726
I know you vouched for me
to get this job. I appreciate that.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.360
I appreciate the pressure
that we're all under to solve this,

05:36.520 --> 05:38.602
but give me time
to do the job you hired me to do.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.489
I will, Tess. I'm trying.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.644
But you're better than this. You should
have had a working theory by now.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.529
Makes me wonder
if somethings going on here

05:45.680 --> 05:47.967
- that I don't know about.
- Listen, Tess, I figured out--

05:50.320 --> 05:52.163
- Figured out what?
- What are you doing here?

05:52.320 --> 05:54.766
- You should be home.
- It's okay. I'm okay.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.364
You asked me to look into suspects
in Julianna's murder, right?

06:00.040 --> 06:02.168
Yeah, but not the day
after your wedding.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.769
Still, you were pretty insistent,
captain, and so I got right to work.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.490
I might have figured out
who killed her.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.608
Why don't you give
the chief and I a second--?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.642
- Who do you think it was?
- The Interpol terrorist

06:13.800 --> 06:16.007
who escaped from JFK
before my wedding.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.802
- Liam Cullen?
- Yeah, Liam Cullen.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.367
Cat, I was doing everything I could
not to connect Liam to Julianna,

06:25.520 --> 06:27.170
to keep the superhuman crap
out of it.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.845
You don't understand,
that's the point.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.923
I don't want you to cover anymore.
Why should you?

06:31.080 --> 06:33.367
Why should I--? What the hell
are you talking about?

06:33.520 --> 06:35.409
- We don't have a choice.
- Yes, we do.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.289
This isn't about beasts, right?

06:37.440 --> 06:38.441
Or Vincent or me.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.366
So why should we have to lie
to cover for whoever this Liam guy is?

06:42.520 --> 06:44.284
Did you get hit in the head
when he attacked?

06:44.440 --> 06:46.568
I mean, obviously
you are not thinking clearly.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.520
I was wrong to think that this was
all my responsibility, okay?

06:50.680 --> 06:52.603
And since every person
that I care about

06:52.760 --> 06:54.808
has been put in danger
because of it,

06:54.960 --> 06:56.883
it's my responsibility to fix it.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.408
Look, we have a victim, right?
We know who did it.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.450
So why hide it?
Let's just build a case.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.649
Prove that Liam's the one that
killed her, and move on with our lives.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.402
- You make it sound so simple.
- It is simple.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.085
This is our Get Out of Jail Free card.

07:11.240 --> 07:15.370
This is our golden opportunity
to get out from underneath all this.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.171
So, what, we treat a superhuman
monster like a regular perp?

07:18.320 --> 07:21.051
- Arrest him? Then what?
- I don't know.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.971
I don't know, but I know that we can't
keep doing this by ourselves anymore.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.724
There's a limit to what we can do.

07:28.440 --> 07:32.240
I think that if we can get together
enough cops to corner Liam,

07:32.400 --> 07:35.165
he's not gonna use his powers.
Not in public, anyway.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.005
The one thing that we know that
all of these people have in common--

07:38.160 --> 07:41.164
Beasts, Julianna, Liam.
--Is that they don't want to be exposed.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.001
Besides, do you have a better idea?

07:46.560 --> 07:48.289
Excuse me, captain,
somebody just got caught

07:48.440 --> 07:50.647
- breaking into the morgue.
- Give it to the lieutenant.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.121
He got caught trying to steal
Julianna Keaton's body.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.851
Liam. I'll need backup.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.724
Check the north staircase.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.606
You?

08:09.840 --> 08:11.729
It's just a little misunderstanding.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.360
- I got this.
- Okay, we're good here.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.091
What are you doing here? Why would
you want to steal Julianna's body?

08:19.240 --> 08:22.528
I didn't try and steal Julianna's body.
I was just trying to track Liam off of it.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.769
- Anyway, it's a good thing I came--
- No, it is not a good thing.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.446
This is a police case, I told you.
One that I am handling.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.887
This is not a police case,
and you know it.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.691
- We have had this conversation.
- No, you had this conversation.

08:34.840 --> 08:35.921
I didn't agree to anything.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.083
But once you see what someone's
done to Julianna's body,

08:39.240 --> 08:41.049
I think you'll agree with me.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.929
- What happened?
- All the blood was drained

08:44.080 --> 08:46.686
from her body, postmortem.
Even from her lymphatic system,

08:46.840 --> 08:48.842
meaning there's not an ounce
of blood left anywhere.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.047
- But why?
- I don't know.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.282
I guess Liam thought
she was enhanced too.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.684
Either wanted to get
the serum for himself,

08:54.840 --> 08:56.763
or make sure no one else
gets their hands on it.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.288
Or he wanted to destroy any evidence
that could conceivably link him to her.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.650
- Superhuman evidence, right?
- Only we know that.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.883
As far as anyone else is concerned,
he's a creepy guy with a creepy motive.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.691
- This city is full of them.
- Catherine, you can't cover this up.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.241
I don't plan on it.
I'm going to interview witnesses

09:12.400 --> 09:14.482
and see if I can prove
that Liam did this.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.563
- That's never gonna work.
- Where are you going?

09:16.720 --> 09:19.087
To try and track
whoever took Julianna's blood.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.323
No, you can't, Vincent.
I have to bring you in for questioning.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.611
You're serious?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.211
Don't make me arrest you, honey.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.367
Listen, if you have to
subpoena tapes, do it.

09:44.520 --> 09:48.206
Gas stations, ATMs, Metro.
I'll take every camera I can get.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.124
- Cat.
- 39th is sending us more surveillance,

09:50.280 --> 09:51.850
see if we can spot Liam
near the morgue.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.401
Tell rne you didn't bring Vincent
in for questioning, please.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.607
Yeah, I did.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.091
- Cat...
- Relax.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.527
It's not really for questioning.
It's just for show.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.365
With Command breathing down
your neck, I didn't want to cut corners.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.682
- It's for your own good.
- It's not for your own good.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.127
- Vincent's pissed.
- He won't be when this is behind us.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.568
When we get our normal lives back,
which is all he ever wanted.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.088
Normally I'd be the first to applaud you
getting back in the fold, being a cop,

10:14.240 --> 10:16.971
but I don't think you're
really thinking this thing through.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.321
Tess...

10:18.960 --> 10:21.440
You arrested Julianna.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.523
She escaped
and broke into your precinct,

10:23.680 --> 10:25.887
then she got killed on your watch.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.010
That's not the way I'd look at it,
but it's the way that Chief Ward does.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.723
You need to stop covering.
You need a plausible explanation.

10:32.880 --> 10:37.363
And the only way to get that is
to bust the guy who killed her: Liam.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.490
I'm telling you, okay?
Catherine is losing her damn mind.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.847
Okay, let's calm down.
We'll figure this out.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.401
What's there to figure out?
We gotta get her back onboard.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.608
Catherine knows
that we work better together.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.889
- What the hell is she thinking?
- She's not thinking. She's afraid.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.769
She's afraid she made
a terrible mistake,

10:55.920 --> 10:57.843
putting us all up to this.
She feels responsible.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.367
She was right to get us involved
in this in the first place.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.046
Maybe we didn't see it at first,
but she was. She was right.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.443
Except now she's not so sure,
which is why she wants to stop it.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.648
The danger, the cover-ups.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.087
Okay, in her defence,
it's not a great way to live.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.242
I know, believe me.
I spent 12 years of my life

11:13.400 --> 11:15.368
trying to cover things up.
It's not the solution.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.205
But it won't catch Liam, either.

Otherwise, God only knows
what he's gonna do next.

I know, I know, but I also know

11:23.880 --> 11:26.247
that bad things happen
when you and Cat aren't in sync.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.845
So, what do you suggest we do?

Yeah, Tyler Zane.

can't believe you're ganging up on rne.

that you are making a huge mistake.

No, I am trying to rectify one.
And, by the way,

11:58.120 --> 12:00.930
the position that I am taking
is the same one you all used to take.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.924
So, what, you don't want
normal lives anymore?

12:04.080 --> 12:05.525
Of course we do,
but we can't pretend

12:05.680 --> 12:07.921
this isn't happening,
that Liam's not out there, can we?

We're not. I told you.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.087
Heather, why are you here?

12:17.240 --> 12:19.925
Bringing the presents from the church.
I assume you'll return them?

12:20.080 --> 12:23.163
Cat, of course we all still want
normal lives. That hasn't changed.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.971
But what I'm trying to figure out
is why you changed.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.361
Weren't you at the wedding?
Didn't you see what happened?

12:28.520 --> 12:31.091
Yeah, but frankly that stuff
happens to us all the time.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.084
Not like that, it doesn't.
And not anymore.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.004
- Does anyone wanna fill me in?
- Look, maybe

12:36.160 --> 12:37.730
it was part of the bigger purpose,

12:37.880 --> 12:39.848
All right?
Something that you used to believe in.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.606
And something I was pretty
sceptical about at first,

12:42.760 --> 12:44.808
- but now I'm not.
- Ditto that.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.290
Look, Cat, all I want is a normal life.
You know that, okay?

12:48.440 --> 12:51.091
But we can't have that
until we finish what we started,

12:51.240 --> 12:53.561
which is to stop
whoever is behind all this.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.165
But we can't stop them.

We are not superhuman.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.928
We can't fight every fight. No one can.
And I don't want to die trying.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.004
- I agree with Cat.
- Heather, please. Not now.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.131
Look, I know that I am relatively new
to this whole beast/superhuman thing,

13:10.280 --> 13:13.011
but I'm not new to being a sister.
She's the only family I have left.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.162
And I don't want to lose her,
or any of you.

13:15.320 --> 13:19.928
Or me. I get her argument,
but I don't get any of yours.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.846
Well, either you buy into the destiny
of it all, or you don't, but--

13:24.000 --> 13:26.162
Who says? I mean, how can you
prove it's her destiny?

13:26.320 --> 13:29.005
Or yours or mine? I don't even know
if I believe in destiny, anyway.

13:29.160 --> 13:32.004
Okay, what about responsibility?
Don't you believe in that?

13:32.160 --> 13:34.242
It sounds to me like
Cat's being very responsible,

13:34.400 --> 13:38.007
wanting to handle this like a cop,
and not risk our lives by doing it alone.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.003
It makes all the sense in the world.

at stake here. You get that?

to get that upset.

knows how important you are to her,

15:23.080 --> 15:25.208
and how much
she values your opinion.

why is he so willing to risk her life?

The reason Cat's willing
to risk her life.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.645
- Well, at least up until today.
- I don't get it. It's a journal.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.691
- And it looks old.
- It is old. About 170 years old.

15:48.840 --> 15:53.368

great-great-great-great aunt, Rebecca.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.804
Cat's father's line, but not yours.

And bottom line is, Rebecca
fell in love with a beast too.

- It's a long story, but the point is,

Cat never believed in
any of this destiny stuff, either,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.126

- Bob and Carol are already dead,

every surveillance camera shooting,

17:34.720 --> 17:35.721

explain what happened somehow.

is nobody else.

is pick up the trail of the hit man again.

- Yeah, fine. Just my ego is bruised.

- I was trying to separate the good part

20:22.160 --> 20:26.484
of Julianna's serum from the bad,
but it's obviously networking.

that just supports what Cat is doing,

so that Vincent won't die, either,

20:52.600 --> 20:56.127
An almost identical situation
happened to Cat and Vincent last year,

20:56.280 --> 20:58.044
but because Cat read
Rebecca's journal,

20:58.200 --> 21:00.771
she learned from it. She didn't make
the same mistake Rebecca did.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.922
And that's how she saved Vincent.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.368
Okay, that doesn't prove
that Cat and Vincent have a destiny.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.443
Except why would Rebecca
have written it all down

21:08.600 --> 21:10.887
if she didn't believe
that somebody down the line

21:11.040 --> 21:13.520
- was destined to fight the same fights?
- What?

21:13.680 --> 21:16.604
You think it's coincidence
that almost 200 years later,

21:16.760 --> 21:19.730
Cat met Vincent
just like Rebecca met Alistair?

21:19.880 --> 21:22.963
And they both had to fight beasts
and monsters like Liam?

21:23.120 --> 21:26.681
- Yeah, it could be a coincidence.
- Or it isn't. And if it's not,

21:26.840 --> 21:30.765
if it is fate, or destiny,
or whatever you want to call it,

21:30.920 --> 21:34.129
then Cat could be making the
biggest mistake of her life by quitting.

21:34.280 --> 21:37.363
Because if she and Vincent are meant
to be together, and not just for love,

21:37.520 --> 21:40.763
then they do have a greater purpose,
one that they can't quit.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.045
I'm sorry, it just all sounds
so far-fetched.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.124
Like beasts
and superhumans aren't?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.287
Okay. There's somebody
I want you to talk to.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.091
Somebody that knows more
about this stuff than anybody.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.561
- Who?
- Cat's father.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.245
I know. Trust me.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.683
- Didn't start without you, captain.
- Thank you.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.207
WARD: Detective Chandler said
you discovered a break in the case.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.442
- I'm kind of short on time, so...
- Right, okay.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.682
So, DHS approached
Captain Vargas and I

22:16.840 --> 22:18.729
to help investigate
a dangerous new street drug,

22:18.880 --> 22:20.769
hoping that we could track down
its distributor.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.003
DHS approached you directly? Why
didn't they use the proper channels?

22:24.160 --> 22:26.481
- Well, actually--
- It was before Tess became captain.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.210
- Right.
- Anyway, we followed

22:28.360 --> 22:31.170
a couple of leads to two users,
Tyler Zane and Alton Finn.

22:31.320 --> 22:34.051
Zane? Isn't he that Vic you found
dead in the psychiatric hospital?

22:34.200 --> 22:39.127
Exactly. And I think-- We think
that he was killed in a cover-up.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.806
The same cover-up
that cost Julianna Keaton her life.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.724
Wait, what's Keaton's
connection to all this?

22:43.880 --> 22:47.202
Well, she was the one responsible
for making the drug. Right?

22:47.360 --> 22:49.647
And distributing it,
which is why we arrested her.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.290
And then she broke out of jail,

22:51.440 --> 22:53.807
she tried to steal all the evidence
that we had against her,

22:53.960 --> 22:56.611
and then she tried to get revenge
against rne at my wedding.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.125
Okay, so, what are you suggesting?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.328
I'm suggesting
we give this case back to DHS.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.960
I mean, if we're dealing with
an Interpol terrorist,

23:03.120 --> 23:05.885
this is way over our heads.
This guy is a monster.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.481
- You agree?
- It's her case.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.609
Okay, give it back to DHS.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.762
Tell them we'll cooperate
in whatever way we can,

23:14.920 --> 23:16.251
but that it's their case.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.131
Which means
it's no longer our problem.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.601
Looks like you're
off the hook, captain.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.320
Thanks.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.726
Oh, Cat, I sure hope
you know what you're doing.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.486
I am getting our lives back,
that's what I'm doing.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.523
Come on, let's go finish this
once and for all.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.889
So why did my agents
approach you with this, again?

23:48.040 --> 23:50.725
I don't know. Actually, I think
they were looking for some help.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.969
- Help in finding Liam?
- No, Julianna.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.441
We don't know how Liam's
involved, exactly.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.728
Well, other than the fact that
he murdered Julianna.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.201
Well, if this Liam Cullen--
If that really is his name.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.806
If he is involved, then this case
should never have left DHS,

24:04.960 --> 24:07.008
especially if Interpol wants him too.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.322
Are you sure that you ID'd
this man at your wedding?

24:09.480 --> 24:11.130
- Positive.
- There is no question

24:11.280 --> 24:13.169
that he killed
Julianna Keaton, Agent Russo.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.483
- Do you have any idea why?
- Theories. They're all in the file.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.484
You might want to look at Thomas's
and Barnett's files, though,

24:19.640 --> 24:22.211
since they're the agents
that contacted us originally.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.921
Well, this is obviously not a local case,
so we will be taking it over from here.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.367
I would like to apologise for
any inconvenience

24:28.520 --> 24:30.363

of your files, you'll be done.

to cover for us anymore, right?

- Yeah, after Alistair died.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.040
What did she do? Did she give up?

25:31.840 --> 25:33.968
She died.
Actually, she was murdered.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.043

- Oh, yeah. It was about a year or so

25:36.200 --> 25:39.409

It was probably the same beast.

- He tried to have Vincent killed.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.687
that he and Catherine
were meant to be together.

- but I was wrong.
- So, what does this have to do

26:13.320 --> 26:16.403
- with Rebecca and Alistair?
- Rebecca and Alistair? Everything.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.846
A hundred and seventy years ago,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.651
they were fighting the same fights,
but they lost.

26:21.760 --> 26:25.048

are meant to pick up where they left off.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.009
But if Catherine quits...

26:27.160 --> 26:29.527
Well, the same thing that happened
to Rebecca when she quit,

26:29.680 --> 26:31.603
that could happen to Catherine too.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.324
- This is crazy.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.322
Yep, I guess it is.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.642
We'll be in touch.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.849
Well, that was fun.
Thank God you covered.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.162
- I didn't have much of a choice.
- Actually, you did.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.808
Does this mean
you're finally back onboard?

33:57.960 --> 34:00.042
No, it means that I don't know
what's right anymore.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.885
Which is why I told Vincent to leave
before everyone got here.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.202
Didn't wanna raise any flags
that I couldn't take down.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.761
Sounds like the old Cat to me.
Just saying.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.605
- Hey, everything all right?
- Are you all right?

34:10.760 --> 34:11.761
Yeah, I think.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.491
Although I can't figure out
why Liam was after my blood.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.880
- Shh, not so loud.
- Where's Heather?

34:17.040 --> 34:19.610
Uh, she went for a walk.
You might want to join her.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.684
MAN: Looks like they shot out
the windows from the outside...

34:28.320 --> 34:31.369
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.563
Are you okay?

34:36.440 --> 34:38.487
Define "okay."

34:39.719 --> 34:43.690
Oh, crazy life you lead, Cat.
Really crazy.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.844
Yeah, I know. Keep trying
to figure out ways to change it.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.721
- I don't think you can.
- What do you mean?

34:51.920 --> 34:56.130
Guess who I met today.
Your father.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.887
- In prison?
- Yeah.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.328
He had some pretty interesting
things to say about you.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.528
And about Rebecca.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.565
- Did Vincent put you up to this?
- No. J.T. did, actually.

35:10.720 --> 35:15.726
He cares about you too, Cat.
Everybody does. You're lucky.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.445
But I don't think that
you can just quit this, Cat.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.120
I mean, look at
what happened today.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.648
It all comes back around to you,
whether you want it to or not.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.006
Where is this coming from?

35:29.160 --> 35:32.528
Vincent, your friends,
your ancestor, your...

35:32.680 --> 35:35.684
Your destiny. I don't know.

35:35.840 --> 35:39.845
Don't ask rne to try and explain it,
because I can't. It's just...

35:40.000 --> 35:43.721
The more I think about it,
the more I realise that...

35:43.880 --> 35:48.920
...maybe this is your path, Cat,
yours and Vincent's.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.241
For whatever reason.

36:01.160 --> 36:05.006
All right, spill. What's the matter?

36:05.160 --> 36:07.242
- You following me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.131
- What can I get you?
- Hi. I'll have what he's having.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.884
WOMAN:
Sure thing.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.684
So?

36:14.840 --> 36:17.207
So, what?

36:17.360 --> 36:19.840
Doesn't matter.
It's not your problem anymore, okay?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.889
Right, because the only reason
I listened to you

36:22.040 --> 36:23.280
before we broke up was for sex.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.603
Hey, keep your voice down, will you?

36:27.480 --> 36:30.450
I thought I was cured. I really did.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.683
Thought I was past
all this serum stuff.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.128
J.T., just because Liam went after you
doesn't mean you're not cured.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.328
He was also after Alton,
and Allen's cured.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.801
Is he? Do you know that for sure?

36:41.960 --> 36:45.931
Because Liam wanted both of us dead
for some reason.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.004
And he sure went to
a hell of a lot of trouble to try too.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.209
Still, you haven't had
any symptoms, right?

36:52.360 --> 36:56.046
Maybe he was just making sure,
trying to cover his bases.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.885
- Maybe.
- Look, bottom line is,

36:59.040 --> 37:01.691
just because the guy's a maniac
and went all scorched-earth on you,

37:01.840 --> 37:03.968
it doesn't prove that stuffs
still in you, okay?

37:04.120 --> 37:10.571
Maybe not, but as long as he thinks
it is, he'll still be after me, right?

37:29.160 --> 37:30.366
You realise, if we ever move,

37:30.520 --> 37:32.807
we're gonna have to get
another place with a rooftop.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.610
Spend enough time up here,
don't we?

37:34.760 --> 37:35.841
Or not.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.209
Well, we've been shot at up here,
attacked, attacked again.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.045
Yeah, but we've also had
romantic dinners,

37:42.200 --> 37:45.124
talked, kissed, made love.
It hasn't been all bad.

37:45.280 --> 37:48.807
Well, hopefully it's more of the latter
and less of the former.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.725
- That's the goal, right?
- Definitely.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.321
So how do we get there?

37:53.480 --> 37:56.051
I don't know.
I don't have an easy answer.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.806
I thought I did.
I thought that by quitting the fight,

37:58.960 --> 38:01.327
handing it off to Homeland Security
or somebody,

38:01.480 --> 38:04.165
that that would be the answer,
but clearly it is not.

38:04.320 --> 38:08.211
Really? Because after seeing
how far Liam is willing to go,

38:08.360 --> 38:10.488
after everything he tried to do
to Heather and J.T.,

38:10.640 --> 38:12.404
I was beginning to think
that you were right.

38:13.520 --> 38:17.366
Now, maybe, maybe we can't
stop him by ourselves.

38:17.520 --> 38:21.525
I know. It's scary.
That's why I wanted to quit,

38:21.680 --> 38:25.207
to make sure that everybody we care
about isn't put in harm's way again,

38:25.360 --> 38:28.807
- including ourselves. But...
- But we're in danger anyway.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.005
Just like Rebecca was.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.531
- I'll fill you in later.
- Okay.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.762
Look, the point is
that even Heather is behind

38:36.920 --> 38:41.448
this whole greater-purpose thing,
despite what almost happened to her.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.961
Actually, everyone's behind it,
despite everything.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.009
Does it really matter?

38:48.160 --> 38:51.084
Because if you're not onboard,
then I'm not, either.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.287
I just- I want it to end.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.649
I want us to be able to
go back to our lives and get married.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.246
Now, I think what you originally said,

38:59.400 --> 39:02.085
that we have a greater responsibility,
is right,

39:02.240 --> 39:05.528
but we also have a greater
responsibility to ourselves too.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.602
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

39:10.040 --> 39:13.567
I'll do whatever you want, okay,
as long as we do it together.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.888
Then let's go get Liam.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.691
Together.
