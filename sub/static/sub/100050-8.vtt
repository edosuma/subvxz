WEBVTT

00:08.530 --> 00:10.184
Here we go.ADULT SHELDON: For many kids,

00:10.227 --> 00:12.534
Christmas morning was the most
exciting day of the year.

00:12.577 --> 00:15.232
That's only because
most kids don't know the joy

00:15.276 --> 00:18.975
of getting
their college midterms back.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.022
It also didn't hurt that Dr. Sturgis looked like an elf.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.808
Nice work, Sheldon.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.723
Now,

00:27.766 --> 00:31.248
you'll notice that your grades
are lower than expected.

00:31.292 --> 00:34.860
That's because
Sheldon did so well,

00:34.904 --> 00:36.471
he broke the curve,

00:36.514 --> 00:39.909
turning your A's and B's
into B's and C's.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.654
They don't seem happy about it.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.352
Maybe you can give them candy.

00:49.745 --> 00:52.661
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

00:52.704 --> 00:55.490
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

00:55.533 --> 00:58.536
♪ I bet I could be your hero

00:58.580 --> 01:01.235
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:01.278 --> 01:04.673
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

01:07.850 --> 01:11.158
DALE: Okay. This is
where I spend all my time,

01:11.201 --> 01:14.291
yet somehow my ex-wife
owns half of it.

01:14.335 --> 01:17.077
Mm, not bitter at all.
Good for you.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.167
We got baseball over here
and got football right there

01:20.210 --> 01:22.212
and then hunting
and fishing in the back.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.866
Oh, yeah.

01:23.909 --> 01:26.086
And this hockey puck
has been here

01:26.129 --> 01:28.131
since Jimmy Carter
was president.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.177
You'd think a sport with
a bunch of white boys

01:30.220 --> 01:33.745
beating each other up would
be more popular in Texas.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.791
So, you want to head out?

01:36.966 --> 01:39.969
Oh, my grandson's been
wanting some weights.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.623
Sheldon?

01:41.666 --> 01:44.756
Hell, can't he just lift
a soup can or something?

01:44.800 --> 01:47.324
The other grandson.
The pretty one with the hair.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.544
Ah. All right.
Well, send him by.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.459
We'll give him the family
and friends discount.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.200
How big a discount?

01:53.243 --> 01:57.204
Well, uh, depends on, uh,
how much fun we have tonight.

01:57.247 --> 02:00.250
Are you putting a price
on my affections?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.165
Yeah, kinda.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.601
You're gonna regret it.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.212
I'm really fun.

02:08.171 --> 02:10.695
CRUSHER: ...fever down,
try to let the body heal itself.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.176
PICARD: Keep me advised.
Picard out.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.744
Captain, the neutrino...

02:16.788 --> 02:18.529
Cooper residence.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.879
Hello, Sheldon.Dr. Sturgis.

02:20.923 --> 02:23.055
I'd love to talk to you,
but I'm right in the middle

02:23.099 --> 02:25.014
of Star Trek: The Next
Generation.It's a good one.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.668
Geordi goes missing,

02:26.711 --> 02:29.192
but Wesley Crusher has a plan
to use neutrinos to locate him,

02:29.236 --> 02:31.716
since they'd be visible
to Geordi's visor.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.066
I was actually calling
to speak to your father.

02:34.110 --> 02:37.418
But I'm glad you're having fun
with your friends.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.810
Hang on. I'll go get him.

02:39.855 --> 02:42.031
Dad! Phone call!

02:42.074 --> 02:44.207
ADULT SHELDON: Even though
Dr. Sturgis was confused,

02:44.251 --> 02:47.558
one day, Wesley Crusher
really would be my friend.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.212
Neat, huh?

02:50.257 --> 02:51.736
Hey, John.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.999
George. John Sturgis here.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.479
That's why I said "Hey, John."

02:55.523 --> 02:57.046
Great.

02:57.089 --> 03:01.006
I was wondering if we could
go out for a beer and talk.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.095
Oh. Well, aren't we
talking right now?

03:03.139 --> 03:05.097
Yes, but we had so much fun
last time,

03:05.141 --> 03:07.012
I thought we could do it again.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.101
Gee, John, last time,
you got drunk

03:09.145 --> 03:11.103
and threw up
in my glove compartment.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.931
Did I?

03:12.975 --> 03:15.630
Well, while I don't remember
any of that happening,

03:15.673 --> 03:18.546
I promise to be
on my best behavior.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.417
And the drinks are on me.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.158
Na zdrowie!

03:22.202 --> 03:25.944
That's, uh, "to our
health" in Russian.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.165
: This is not
the place to talk Russian.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.646
So, what's up?

03:31.689 --> 03:35.258
Well, Sheldon has been
doing extraordinarily well

03:35.302 --> 03:37.260
in his college
physics class.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.567
I know. He made me put
his test up on the fridge,

03:39.610 --> 03:42.265
next to Missy's drawing
of her hand as a turkey.

03:42.309 --> 03:47.052
So, uh, the university has taken
notice of Sheldon's talents,

03:47.096 --> 03:50.230
and they would
very much like him

03:50.273 --> 03:52.971
to enroll full-time.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.757
Yeah, we've been
down this road, John.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.628
Sheldon's only ten.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.979
Mary and I both have jobs.
We just can't make it work.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.286
Well, that's why they
asked me to speak to you.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.983
They're looking
to sweeten the pot.

04:05.027 --> 04:07.421
That's a gambling metaphor.

04:07.464 --> 04:10.293
A lesser-known version
is "sweeten the kitty."

04:10.337 --> 04:12.991
I assume the difference
is regional,

04:13.035 --> 04:15.167
but I'm no etymologist.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.648
This beer is yummy. Mmm!

04:17.692 --> 04:20.216
So, what are
they offering, John?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.218
They thought it would
be easier on the family

04:22.262 --> 04:24.960
if you were employed
at the university.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.049
Really?Yes, that way,

04:27.092 --> 04:28.442
you could drive Sheldon

04:28.485 --> 04:31.314
and keep an eye on him
while he's there.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.620
But I'm a football coach.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.056
Does the school
even have a team?

04:34.099 --> 04:35.057
Oh, yes, they do.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.667
They-they don't win much,

04:36.711 --> 04:39.975
but they lead the
league in injuries.

04:40.018 --> 04:43.326
Well, guess that's a thing.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.023
Okay.

04:45.067 --> 04:48.505
Anyway, I believe
they're willing to, uh,

04:48.549 --> 04:52.727
exceed your current salary
by a substantial amount.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.294
Is that so?

04:54.337 --> 04:55.425
Yes.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.862
They thought it would
incentivize you.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.561
Well, John, they're not wrong.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.346
Excellent!

05:03.390 --> 05:05.479
Na zdrowie.

05:05.522 --> 05:08.438
What the hell.
: Na zdrowie.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.267
How was Dr. Sturgis?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.356
He's fine.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.618
What did you two talk about?

05:14.662 --> 05:16.794
I don't know. S-Stuff.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.143
Science stuff?

05:18.187 --> 05:20.276
No. Just regular stuff.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.758
Ooh, I bet he talked about me.
What did he say about me?

05:23.801 --> 05:25.412
Sheldon, everything
isn't about you.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.239
Okay? Go to your room.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.763
Yes, sir.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.548
What'd y'all talk about?

05:31.592 --> 05:32.854
Sheldon.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.508
Oh.

05:36.118 --> 05:39.600
The university wants to
offer me a coaching job

05:39.643 --> 05:42.385
if it'll help to get Sheldon
to go there full-time.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.082
Oh.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.736
We talked about this.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.260
College might be
too much for him.I know.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.392
That's why I'd be
there, you know,

05:49.436 --> 05:50.698
to help him over
the rough spots.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.395
I don't know, George.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.876
Can't hurt to see
what the offer is.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.095
There are more important things
than money.

05:57.139 --> 06:00.272
That's cute. You should
knit that on a pillow.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.015
Maybe I'll push that pillow
over your face.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.850
Scuse me.
You Mr. Ballard?

06:12.894 --> 06:14.199
Yeah, that'd be me.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.028
I'm Georgie,
Connie Tucker's grandson.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.029
Oh, yeah.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.596
The hair. Very pretty.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.164
Hang on a second. I got to
deal with this guy, okay?

06:22.207 --> 06:24.035
Take your time.So,

06:24.079 --> 06:25.689
here you go. Here's the rod
you were asking about.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.256
Now, that's a good choice.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.518
Very solid.Mm. Mm.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.520
And then I just brought
this one along

06:30.564 --> 06:33.088
to show you, just in case,
later, you know,

06:33.131 --> 06:34.916
you get serious
about fishing.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.135
Well... I'm pretty serious.

06:37.179 --> 06:40.922
Yeah. You know,
I-I had that feeling.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.445
Wh-What's your name?

06:42.489 --> 06:43.707
Jim.Jim.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.231
Well, Jim, this rod
is a little pricey.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.885
It's double the
cost of that one,

06:47.929 --> 06:49.191
but it's worth every penny.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.323
And, uh, it's the rod I use.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.325
Well, then that's
the one I want.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.849
Well, that's a good choice.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.328
There you go.

06:56.372 --> 06:58.243
Now, with a rod like this,
you want to use live bait,

06:58.287 --> 06:59.549
and we don't carry that here.

06:59.593 --> 07:03.858
But down the street is
Ed's Bait and Tackle Shop.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.643
And if you tell him Dale sent
you, he'll take care of you.

07:06.687 --> 07:07.818
I appreciate that.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.168
So, take her over there
to Bernice,

07:10.212 --> 07:13.084
and she'll ring you up.Thanks.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.738
DALE:
Hey.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.261
And-and bring me
back some catfish.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.089
JIM:
You bet.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.308
Yeah.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.309
You're a really
good salesman.

07:20.352 --> 07:21.745
Well, yeah.
Not only that,

07:21.789 --> 07:24.400
I get a kickback on everybody
I send down to Ed's.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.749
You're awesome.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.577
I know.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.668
Ooh. 35 cents off Goober.

07:31.712 --> 07:32.930
What's Goober?

07:32.974 --> 07:34.671
Peanut butter and jelly
in the same jar.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.847
Think about how much time
we'd save.

07:36.891 --> 07:37.935
GEORGE JR.:
Hey.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.023
Dale give you
a good price

07:39.067 --> 07:40.503
on those weights?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.418
Better. He gave me a job.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.029
Damn. He didhave fun
last night.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.770
What kind of job?Salesman.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.251
Well, congratulations.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.557
I'm gonna learn a lot from him.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.167
He's real good at getting people
to spend money

07:52.210 --> 07:53.560
on stuff they don't need.

07:53.603 --> 07:56.693
Well, I don't know if I
like the sound of that.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.348
You know what I like
the sound of? Ka-ching.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.616
Well, thank you.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.314
That's a very generous offer.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.316
Let me discuss it
with my family,

08:11.360 --> 08:13.362
and I'll get back to you.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.843
Bye.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.845
What was that about?

08:17.888 --> 08:19.629
Are you my family?

08:19.673 --> 08:21.022
I don't know.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.677
I like to think of myself
as your work wife.

08:26.244 --> 08:29.552
So, that's why I wanted
to give you a heads-up.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.859
I got to tell you, George,
this is a real blow.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.862
Appreciate it. But, uh,
yeah, you'll find someone.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.386
There's a lot of good
coaches out there.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.519
Not you. Sheldon.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.521
Sheldon?

08:41.564 --> 08:44.393
I thought everyone would be
thrilled for him to leave.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.699
Don't get me wrong,

08:45.742 --> 08:48.397
your kid is
a royal pain in the ass.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.139
I have a problem with
this permission slip.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.575
You didn't cut them
in half evenly.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.925
Mine has two holes,
and Derek here just has one.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.405
Then trade.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.712
Then Derek will have two holes,
and mine will have one.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.279
You're not going
to the water park anyway!

09:01.323 --> 09:04.587
However, his state test scores
are so extraordinary,

09:04.631 --> 09:07.198
the school actually gets
more funding because of it.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.722
You serious?

09:08.765 --> 09:10.854
Serious as the fire alarms,
which are now functional.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.511
And always were, if anyone asks.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.167
I don't know
what to tell you, Tom.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.996
They're offering
me a pretty nice raise.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.520
Well, I can't afford
to lose Sheldon,

09:24.564 --> 09:27.871
so what's it gonna take
to keep y'all here, George?

09:30.221 --> 09:32.180
Thank you.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.139
I will discuss it with my
family and get back to you.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.184
Good.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.976
Bit of a kerfuffle
at the church today.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.457
Pastor Jeff promised
Patricia Richards

09:48.500 --> 09:50.546
she could sing "How Great
Thou Art" on Sunday,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.635
but I had already
printed in the bulletin

09:52.679 --> 09:55.116
that Karen Baker
was gonna sing it.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.466
They agreed to a
duet, but it was

09:57.509 --> 09:59.468
touch and go.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.122
Mm.What's a kerfuffle?

10:01.165 --> 10:02.645
Not that.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.733
Hey.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.866
Hey. How was your first day
at work?

10:05.909 --> 10:06.693
Amazing.

10:06.736 --> 10:07.824
I made $38

10:07.868 --> 10:09.217
on commissions alone.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.958
Well, good for you.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.612
What's for dinner?

10:12.655 --> 10:13.656
Meatloaf.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.224
Oh. I think I'm
gonna go out to eat.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.660
No, you are not.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.140
We're having dinner as a family.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.708
Yeah, but I got money now
and I can do what I want.

10:21.751 --> 10:24.232
And what I want is a
chimichanga at Chi-Chi's.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.886
I want a chimichanga
from Chi-Chi's.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.583
They do have
a good margarita.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.977
You are eating here. So are you.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.414
I don't care
what you do.

10:32.457 --> 10:33.415
Later.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.417
Georgie Cooper.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.549
Do not walk out
of that door.

10:37.593 --> 10:38.420
Georgie!

10:38.463 --> 10:40.596
That's a kerfuffle.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.381
Missy, let this be
a lesson to you.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.253
The love of money
is the root of all evil.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.515
GEORGE SR.:
Hey!

10:46.558 --> 10:48.343
You would not
believe the wheelin'

10:48.386 --> 10:50.040
and dealin'
I did today.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.607
I'm playing
the high school

10:51.651 --> 10:53.870
and the university against
each other.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.698
Hey, what do you say
we go out to dinner?

10:55.742 --> 10:56.873
Chi-Chi's is good.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.267
Ooh, chimichangas.

11:04.141 --> 11:07.188
I've asked you all here
because we got a situation.

11:07.231 --> 11:11.366
George Cooper's considering
a job at a college and...

11:11.409 --> 11:13.020
taking Sheldon with him.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.196
Yes!Is it far away?

11:15.239 --> 11:17.372
I hope it's far away.Maybe it's overseas.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.939
Ooh, like Fiji.PETERSEN:
Hold your horses.

11:18.982 --> 11:23.030
If Sheldon walks out that door,
our test scores drop hard.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.554
That affects funding,
which affects your salaries.

11:25.597 --> 11:28.644
Ugh. Well, how can wehelp?

11:28.688 --> 11:31.299
Y'all need to make George
and Sheldon so happy here

11:31.342 --> 11:33.301
they want to stay.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.563
Oh, come on.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.304
Isn't there
anything else we can do?

11:36.347 --> 11:37.871
Yeah, Mr. Givens.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.003
You could do a better job
at teaching the other students

11:40.047 --> 11:44.138
so we don't rely on one boy
to pull up everyone's grades.

11:46.575 --> 11:49.230
Fine. We'll be nice to Sheldon.

Can I speak with you
about a spiritual matter?

12:05.855 --> 12:07.204
My sweet spot. Sit.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.772
What's the buzz?

12:09.816 --> 12:11.861
Tell me, what's a-happenin'?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.298
Jesus Christ Superstar.

It's a great show.

12:15.517 --> 12:18.172
Well, um...

12:18.215 --> 12:21.697
I'm concerned George and Georgie

12:21.741 --> 12:24.004
might be succumbing
to the sin of greed.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.353
Ooh, that's a biggie.

12:25.396 --> 12:27.572
Ever since Georgie
started making money,

12:27.616 --> 12:29.574
he's been very disrespectful.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.708
Meanwhile, my husband's so busy
trying to land a better job,

12:32.752 --> 12:35.102
he doesn't even care how
it might affect Sheldon.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.799
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.541
In Luke 12:15, Jesus says,
"Watch out.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.196
"Be on your guard against
all kinds of greed.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.938
Life does not consist
in an abundance of possessions."

12:44.981 --> 12:46.896
I know, but it seems like
the whole world

12:46.940 --> 12:49.116
is sending the opposite message.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.291
Don't I know it.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.858
Just the other day,
I was at the mall

12:51.901 --> 12:53.555
and a toaster oven
caught my eye.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.818
Next thing you know,
I was in line to buy it,

12:55.862 --> 12:57.951
and I realized
I have a toaster

12:57.994 --> 13:00.562
and I have an oven.
What am I doing?

13:00.605 --> 13:02.825
Turns out Satan
doesn't just hide out

13:02.869 --> 13:04.174
in honky-tonks and casinos.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.655
Sometimes he's in the
appliance section of Sears.

13:06.698 --> 13:10.746
Well, if it's everywhere,
how can we fight it?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.661
We may not be able
to control the world,

13:12.704 --> 13:15.229
but we can control our homes.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.274
It's up to us
to create an environment

13:17.318 --> 13:19.450
where the sin of greed
can find no purchase.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.148
Is that what you've done
in your home?

13:21.191 --> 13:23.498
Well, I do make my toast
vertically,

13:23.541 --> 13:25.282
two slices at a time.

13:25.326 --> 13:28.111
Take that, Satan.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.162
Then Geordi goes missing,
but Wesley Crusher

13:35.205 --> 13:37.642
has a plan to use neutrinos
to locate him,

13:37.686 --> 13:39.993
since they'd be visible
to Geordi's visor.

13:40.036 --> 13:40.994
Is that so?

13:41.037 --> 13:42.212
It is.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.344
I recorded the episode.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.736
I'll show it
to you tonight.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.042
That's okay.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.652
You did such a good job
explaining it,

13:47.696 --> 13:48.828
I feel like I saw it.

13:48.871 --> 13:49.959
You're still seeing it.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.006
What's this?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.879
"Reserved for Coach Cooper."

13:58.794 --> 14:00.056
Would you look at that.
They gave me

14:00.100 --> 14:01.536
a parking spot
right by the door.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.016
Why?

14:03.059 --> 14:04.626
I guess they're
starting to appreciate

14:04.669 --> 14:06.367
my talents around here.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.282
Why?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.285
Oh! There's my man.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.113
Where?

14:13.156 --> 14:14.418
You, silly.

14:14.462 --> 14:17.421
I'm neither a man, nor silly,
but all right.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.902
You're so funny, Sheldon.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.556
Oh, well, that I am.

14:21.599 --> 14:25.473
These are the flyers
for the canned food drive.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.736
And, Sheldon,
you'll be happy to know,

14:27.779 --> 14:29.216
I made sure
they were cut perfectly,

14:29.259 --> 14:32.959
so that each one has exactly
one and a half holes.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.135
But mine has
half a hole on the top,

14:35.178 --> 14:37.920

17:53.942 --> 17:55.074

18:20.664 --> 18:23.493
Your hands aren't clean
in this.
I beg your pardon.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.148
Your new friend Dale
is encouraging Georgie

18:26.192 --> 18:27.845
to be obsessed with money.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.064
Your husband's no good at it.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.631

what's right for Sheldon.

18:34.722 --> 18:37.507

is right for him?

18:37.551 --> 18:39.161
Honestly?

18:39.205 --> 18:41.163
I don't know.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.818
I know that he's bored
in high school,

18:43.861 --> 18:46.342
but he's just so young
for college.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.996
Well, it sounds like
they're trying

18:48.039 --> 18:49.867
to set George up there for him.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.869
I know.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.222
Maybe it's me.

18:56.265 --> 19:00.051
Maybe I'm not ready
for my baby to grow up.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.750
No mother ever is.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.279
I just want to keep
my family safe.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.194
I know.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.327
But at some point,
you got to let them go.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.068
And then one day,
if you're lucky,

19:17.112 --> 19:18.722
they'll move across
the street from you

19:18.766 --> 19:20.594
and absolutely ruin your life.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.729
Seriously, get those people
out of my house.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.078
Okay.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.819
ADULT SHELDON:
Eventually, my mother relented

19:28.863 --> 19:31.735
and returned our things
with a few minor adjustments.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.477
What's The Moosewood Gang?

19:34.521 --> 19:38.655
They solve mysteries
while they learn about God.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.135
Great.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.790
ADULT SHELDON:
Georgie got his music back.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.879
♪ Jesus Christ

19:44.922 --> 19:47.273
♪ Superstar...

19:47.316 --> 19:50.363
What the hell is this?

19:50.406 --> 19:51.799
ADULT SHELDON:
And as for college,

19:51.842 --> 19:53.279
my mother and father
discussed it

19:53.322 --> 19:55.759
and decided that
ten was too young.

19:55.803 --> 19:59.502
So I didn't start
till the ripe old age of 11.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.809
In the meantime...

20:03.463 --> 20:07.031
...I had the key
to one sweet bathroom.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.948
♪ Superstar.

20:16.911 --> 20:20.828
WOMAN :
And we have brand-new designs
on awesome gifts.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.091
And don't forget about
our layaway options.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.488
Lord, give me strength.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.720
I'm sorry, God. I'm weak.
