WEBVTT

03:13.944 --> 03:15.400
And do you, Lana Lang...

03:15.571 --> 03:18.358
...take Alexander Luthor
to be your husband...

03:18.532 --> 03:21.069
...in the holy state of matrimony?

03:21.243 --> 03:26.237
Do you promise to love him,
comfort him, honor, keep him...

03:26.415 --> 03:31.125
...in sickness and in health,
for richer, for poorer...

03:31.295 --> 03:34.958
...and forsaking all others,
as long as you both shall live?

03:35.674 --> 03:36.914
I do.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.854
Lex.
Oh, my God, Lex.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.646
Lex.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.160
I saved you.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.413
I loved him.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.334
You don't mean that.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.252
Lana?

04:18.175 --> 04:19.881
lib}

05:05.305 --> 05:08.342
Shouldn't you be at the Luthor
mansion arranging ﬂowers?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.508
Well, that's just it.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.395
I am at the Luthor mansion.
| just kind of need your help.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.690
Where are you?

05:15.857 --> 05:18.690
Downstairs in the wine cellar.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.191
Chloe?

05:20.362 --> 05:21.727
Clark?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.896
Chloe?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.908
Hurry, it's freezing in here.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.325
The handle broke, Chloe.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.040
Hold on.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.501
Thank you so much.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.258
Next time you have a craving
for a bottle of wine...

05:45.429 --> 05:47.260
...at 11 in the morning, go for a red.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.591
I am so sorry.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.848
Lana hid Lex's wedding present
down here and she asked me...

05:52.019 --> 05:55.182
...to go get it
and then the door shut.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.480
I better go.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.360
That's it?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.615
You ﬁlled your damsel-in-distress
quota for the day...

06:08.785 --> 06:11.276
...and you're just gonna walk away?

06:11.455 --> 06:13.161
What am I supposed to do?

06:13.331 --> 06:16.789
I guess I always just thought...

06:16.960 --> 06:19.042
...that you would sweep in
and save the day.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.203
But you're not gonna do that,
are you?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.464
If Lana didn't wanna marry Lex,
she wouldn't.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.501
Lana's not my hero, Clark. You are.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.927
And this whole idea that you're still
hiding who you really are...

06:32.100 --> 06:35.217
...that you're giving up the one
person that you totally love--

06:35.395 --> 06:37.101
-l'm protecting her.
-Good job.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.139
She's marrying a monster,
trapping herself into a loveless life.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.809
-You think this is easy for me?
-I think it's easier than getting hurt.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.731
You don't hesitate to run
into a burning building...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.571
...orjump in front of a bullet...

06:51.745 --> 06:54.612
...because nothing can penetrate
that iron ﬂesh of yours.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.499
But the one time saving Lana means
putting your heart on the line...

06:58.668 --> 07:02.126
...the man of steel
is nowhere to be found.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.418
Letting Lana go was the hardest
thing I've ever had to do, Chloe.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.678
If you don't know that,
then you don't know me...

07:11.848 --> 07:14.009
...as well as I thought you did.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.283
How did you know Dad was the one?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.162
How'd you know
he felt the same way?

07:48.510 --> 07:51.843
I think when you're young,
like you are...

07:52.013 --> 07:53.878
...like we were...

07:55.183 --> 07:57.048
...nothing is that simple.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.814
I know this is a really
hard day for you, Clark.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.614
You know, I can't help but wonder...

08:23.670 --> 08:26.161
...if all those things I told myself...

08:28.383 --> 08:29.884
...that knowing the truth about me
would be...

08:30.051 --> 08:32.087
...too much for Lana to handle...

08:32.929 --> 08:35.887
...if she knew my secret,
she'd be in danger....

08:39.269 --> 08:42.511
What if I just made up all those
excuses because I was scared?

08:45.692 --> 08:48.354
Then you'd be just like the rest of us.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.230
What do you mean?

08:50.405 --> 08:53.943
Your father and I
almost didn't get married.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.075
I broke it off after a year.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.907
We had a horrible argument...

09:00.081 --> 09:02.458
...and I thought
I'd never see him again.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.413
Yeah, we came
from such different worlds.

09:05.587 --> 09:10.456
Our families, the paths we were on,
everything was stacked against us.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.590
Then why'd you get back together?

09:13.929 --> 09:15.920
Because l--

09:17.766 --> 09:20.678
I couldn't stop thinking about him.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.645
What if I take that risk?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.810
And Lana really is happy with Lex?

09:32.989 --> 09:38.484
All I can tell you, Clark, is that
if I hadn't taken that chance...

09:38.662 --> 09:42.325
...I would have lost everything
that's ever meant something to me.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.990
Clark?

10:16.157 --> 10:19.194
I can't let you go through with this.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.701
Not unless you know everything.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.207
Clark, it's okay,
you don't have to explain.

10:28.378 --> 10:32.667
-I owe it to you.
-No, you don't owe me anything.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.457
I'm the one who's been in denial.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.048
I thought the love that l have
for Lex would be enough.

10:39.222 --> 10:42.214
I can't keep turning my back
on the truth.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.683
What are you saying?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.847
I'm not going to marry Lex.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.732
I don't have time to explain
right now.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.518
I'll meet you at the barn at 5.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.276
You have to go.
I'll be there. I promise.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.656
Go.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.459
How'd you sleep?

12:02.514 --> 12:04.470
Like a baby.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.050
Me too.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.517
I don't know if I can wait.
How about we just run off and elope?

12:12.690 --> 12:15.932
That would be a big waste
of 400 game hens.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.654
It's a big day.
It's okay to be nervous.

12:20.824 --> 12:24.817
I know. I just have a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

12:24.994 --> 12:29.033
In fact, I have to go and meet Chloe,
so I should get ready.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.166
I'll see you at the church.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.176
Busy day at the ofﬁce?

12:52.188 --> 12:55.851
| just had some papers to sign
before the wedding.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.024
Could it be you're avoiding
the fact...

12:59.195 --> 13:02.028
...you've got no one to be with
today and nothing to do?

13:04.868 --> 13:08.201
Fine, Dad, you pegged me.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.495
I'm a little nervous.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.537
You remember when you were
just a little boy?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.501
l'd bring you up here to the ofﬁce?

13:21.551 --> 13:24.167
| used to pretend
it was all mine to control.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.882
Like I could...

13:27.056 --> 13:31.299
...just reach down and move
all the cars as if they were toys.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.187
Pull all the strings
and make people do what I wanted.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.063
But I guess it's all
out of your control, isn't it?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.564
I should hope I taught you better
than that.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.360
You know, Dad, ever since I've been
with Lana, I wake up wondering:

13:50.538 --> 13:53.655
"ls today gonna be the day
when she sees who I really am?"

13:56.336 --> 13:58.452
What if she doesn't show?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.464
I honestly don't know
what my life is without her.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.591
What would you be willing to do...

14:08.765 --> 14:11.427
...to make sure that Lana is standing
next to you...

14:11.601 --> 14:13.307
...at the altar this afternoon?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.933
Anything.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.318
Then she will be.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.275
I promise you.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.867
It's my wedding day.
Whatever it is, it can wait.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.287
Is something wrong?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.628
I'll meet you there.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.516
Dr. Langston?

15:06.322 --> 15:08.654
Is this about Lana?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.156
Is she okay?

15:10.326 --> 15:13.614
That's a bit ambiguous,
after what you've done to her.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.331
In a few minutes,
I'm gonna be exchanging rings...

15:18.501 --> 15:21.038
...directly above
where you're standing.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.589
What was so urgent
it couldn't wait?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.792
Trust me, Lex.
I wouldn't want anything...

15:25.967 --> 15:28.174
...to come between you
and your beautiful bride.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.882
For instance, the truth...

15:32.056 --> 15:33.842
...about her condition.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.722
For your sake...

15:38.896 --> 15:41.353
...I hope I'm not understanding you.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.685
Consider it hazard pay
for the dangerous...

15:43.860 --> 15:47.648
...not to mention unethical position
you've put me in for months.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.149
And today's the day
you hold the most leverage.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.117
Wire $2 million to this account...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.870
...or Miss Lang will know everything.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.627
I don't give in to blackmail.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.754
Oh, I think you will.

16:08.509 --> 16:13.344
No man sinks as low as you have
if he isn't driven by desperation.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.051
Knowing what you've kept from her...

16:16.225 --> 16:19.217
...I wouldn't recommend
putting her love to the test.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.489
I won't let you
take her away from me.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.244
I'll be right there.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.772
Is it time?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.278
It was...

17:51.446 --> 17:53.311
...10 minutes ago.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.488
Lana's not here.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.570
And no one knows where she is.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.088
Lana.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.771
How'd you sleep?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.192
Like a baby.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.739
Me too.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.326
I don't know if I can wait.
How about we just run off and elope?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.708
That would be a pretty big waste
of 400 game hens.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.336
I know it's a big day.
It's okay to be nervous.

19:34.966 --> 19:39.255
I know. I just have a few loose ends
that I need to tie up.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.845
In fact, I have to go meet Chloe,
so I should get ready.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.266
See you at the church.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.653
Aunt Nell.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.951
I can't tell you how long I've been
looking fonNard to this day.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.454
I'm so proud of you.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.754
I wouldn't have missed this day
for anything.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.502
I know that look.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.467
Lana.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.974
This may be
the most important day of your life.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.015
What's wrong?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.356
It's just--

20:52.585 --> 20:55.201
If there were something
that you had to put past you...

20:55.379 --> 20:57.836
...to get on with your life...

20:58.007 --> 21:02.671
...and you tried every way that was
fair and honest to do that...

21:02.845 --> 21:04.801
...and nothing worked...

21:09.101 --> 21:12.593
...is it really wrong
to bend the rules just once?

21:15.733 --> 21:19.692
Well, what would put
those doubts to rest?

21:21.322 --> 21:23.187
The truth.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.823
But if you are gonna promise
your heart to Lex...

21:25.993 --> 21:29.030
...you cannot go to that altar
with anything unresolved.

21:30.164 --> 21:33.201
When it comes to protecting
ourselves...

21:36.212 --> 21:37.998
...we do what we have to do, Lana.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.258
Okay, so you have
your ﬁnal dress ﬁtting at 3.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.093
The limo's picking you up
at 3:30...

21:50.267 --> 21:52.974
...and you have wedding photos
outside the church...

21:53.145 --> 21:56.933
...and naked male
Jell-O Wrestling at 5.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.848
Lana.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.891
Look at me.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.861
You didn't sleep at all last night,
did you?

22:09.870 --> 22:12.156
There's been a lot of pressure.

22:15.584 --> 22:19.247
Since this is your big day, I'll pretend
that I don't see right through that.

22:19.422 --> 22:22.164
I think that's a great idea.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.917
Okay, what else can I do?

22:27.763 --> 22:30.596
Well, if you don't mind,
I hid Lex's wedding gift...

22:30.766 --> 22:33.098
...in the wine cellar
so he wouldn't ﬁnd it.

22:33.269 --> 22:37.854
I guess "personal gofer" falls under
the umbrella of maid of honor.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.273
Oh, what does it look like?

22:41.444 --> 22:43.435
It is behind the Bollinger
in the cooler.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.024
It's a little blue box
with a white bow.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.529
-Okay.
-Thank you.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.940
Yep.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.934
Holy Dom Perignon.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.370
Perfect.

23:42.213 --> 23:43.828
Okay.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.094
Come on, Lana, pick up.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.843
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.561
Shoot.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.314
Shouldn't you be at the Luthor
mansion arranging ﬂowers?

24:11.492 --> 24:15.235
That's just it. I am at the mansion,
but I kind of need your help.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.447
Where are you?

24:16.622 --> 24:19.534
Downstairs in the wine cellar.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.495
Chloe?

24:22.670 --> 24:25.503
-Clark?
-Chloe?

24:26.507 --> 24:28.873
Hurry, I'm freezing in here.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.888
The handle broke, Chloe.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.298
Hold on.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.558
Thank you so much.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.220
Next time you have a craving
for a bottle of wine...

24:43.399 --> 24:45.264
...at 11 in the morning, go for a red.

24:45.442 --> 24:49.060
Yeah, I'm so, so sorry.

24:49.238 --> 24:52.401
I know you'd rather be tied
to a boulder of kryptonite...

24:52.575 --> 24:55.567
...than come here for ground zero
of the Luthor-Lang wedding.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.735
I didn't have a choice.
It wasn't my fault.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.076
Lana hid Lex's wedding present here
and she asked me to get it.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.081
And then the door shut.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.584
I better go.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.881
Wait, that's it?

25:08.048 --> 25:10.755
You ﬁlled your damsel-in-distress
quota for the day...

25:10.926 --> 25:12.666
...and you're just gonna walk away?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.585
Chloe, what am I supposed to do?

25:14.763 --> 25:16.264
I guess I just always ﬁgured...

25:16.432 --> 25:18.969
...you'd sweep in at the last
minute and save the day.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.929
But you're not gonna do that,
are you?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.555
lf Lana didn't wanna marry Lex,
she wouldn't.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.271
Yeah, but Lana's not my hero, Clark.
You are.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.608
And this whole idea that you haven't
told her who you really are...

25:32.781 --> 25:36.114
...that you're giving up the person
that you totally love because—

25:36.285 --> 25:38.276
-l'm protecting her.
-Good job.

25:38.454 --> 25:42.367
She's marrying a monster and she's
gonna be trapped in a loveless life.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.749
You think this is easy for me?

25:45.920 --> 25:47.706
It's easier than getting hurt.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.417
You don't hesitate to run
into a burning building...

25:50.591 --> 25:52.206
...orjump in front of a bullet...

25:52.384 --> 25:54.716
...because nothing can penetrate
that iron ﬂesh of yours.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.129
But the one time saving Lana means
putting your heart on the line...

25:58.307 --> 26:01.344
...the man of steel
is nowhere to be found.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.145
Giving up Lana is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.647
If you don't know that...

26:09.485 --> 26:11.100
...you don't know me very well.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.804
Clark.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.345
I cannot let you go through with this.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.647
Not until you know everything.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.520
Clark, it's okay.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.280
You don't have to explain.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.783
-I owe it to you.
-No, you don't owe me anything.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.037
I'm the one who's been in denial...

27:05.207 --> 27:08.995
...and I thought that the love that
l have for Lex would be enough.

27:09.169 --> 27:12.036
But I can't keep turning my back
on the truth.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.043
What are you saying?

27:18.429 --> 27:20.294
I'm not marrying Lex.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.088
I don't have time
to explain right now.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.883
I'll meet you at the barn at 5:00.

27:28.897 --> 27:32.890
You have to go.
I'll be there. I promise.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.284
Go.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.585
Miss Lang?

27:57.301 --> 27:59.417
Shouldn't you be leaving
for the church?

28:03.599 --> 28:05.055
What's this?

28:16.779 --> 28:18.235
This will destroy Lex.

28:19.782 --> 28:22.694
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry,
but this is none of your business.

28:22.868 --> 28:26.110
I'm making it my business.
I can't let you call off the wedding.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.279
Things have changed...

28:28.457 --> 28:32.120
...and it wouldn't be fair to Lex
to pretend like they haven't.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.295
You know Clark's secret, don't you?

28:39.426 --> 28:42.088
I've been watching you
since you started seeing my son.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.344
And you've been getting closer
and closer...

28:44.515 --> 28:47.507
...to ﬁnding out the shocking truth
about Clark Kent.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.811
What a surprise
it must've been to realize...

28:49.978 --> 28:52.720
...Clark has kept up
the deception for so long...

28:52.898 --> 28:55.640
...right under your nose.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.605
He was trying to protect me.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.816
And he's not gonna let you
threaten me now.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.324
You think Clark's invincible.

29:06.495 --> 29:11.159
Not so. Like every hero,
he has an Achilles' heel, a weakness.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.914
I know what it is.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.207
And I know that it could kill him.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.339
No.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.592
You could never hurt him.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.597
Would you bet Clark's life on that?

29:29.810 --> 29:32.267
I give you my word, Miss Lang.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.350
If you don't honor the promise
that you've made to my son...

29:35.524 --> 29:38.516
...or I ﬁnd out you've told anyone
about this conversation...

29:38.694 --> 29:43.154
...I will kill Clark Kent.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.805
She didn't tell you anything?

30:17.983 --> 30:20.190
She just vanished,
she won't answer her cell.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.191
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.944
But I'm sure there's an explanation
for all this.

30:33.749 --> 30:37.037
Father, did Lana say anything to you?

30:37.211 --> 30:39.076
Anything that might have indicated--

30:39.254 --> 30:40.585
Be patient, Lex.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.371
Give her a little more time.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.665
Wedding-day jitters
are to be expected.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.869
She's not coming.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.492
I've loved you since the ﬁrst moment
I saw you.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.161
Will you marry me?

31:28.095 --> 31:29.926
It's too corny, huh?

32:58.226 --> 33:01.263
Do you, Alexander Luthor,
take Lana Lang...

33:01.438 --> 33:04.726
...to be your wife
in the holy state of matrimony?

33:04.900 --> 33:10.315
Do you promise to love her,
comfort her, honor and keep her...

33:10.489 --> 33:12.480
...in sickness and in health...

33:12.658 --> 33:14.194
...for richer, for poorer...

33:14.368 --> 33:18.486
...and forsaking all others,
as long as you both shall live?

33:22.334 --> 33:24.074
I do.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.297
And do you, Lana Lang...

33:35.472 --> 33:37.963
...take Alexander Luthor
to be your husband...

33:38.141 --> 33:40.598
...in the holy state of matrimony?

33:40.769 --> 33:43.010
Do you promise to love him...

33:43.188 --> 33:46.897
...comfort him, honor
and keep him...

33:47.067 --> 33:49.308
...in sickness and in health...

33:49.486 --> 33:51.852
...for richer, for poorer...

33:52.030 --> 33:55.272
...and forsaking all others
as long as you both shall live?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.122
I do.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.844
[love you.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.271
May I present to you...

34:25.439 --> 34:29.398
...Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Luthor.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.353
I never thought it was possible
to be this happy.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.688
How did I ever turn out
to be the man...

35:14.863 --> 35:17.570
...who gets to spend
the rest of his life with you?

35:19.201 --> 35:21.032
Okay.

35:21.203 --> 35:23.865
I'll just get my things...

35:24.039 --> 35:26.121
...Mrs. Luthor.

35:41.223 --> 35:43.214
I'll be right there.

35:50.232 --> 35:51.893
I waited for you.

35:52.442 --> 35:53.818
Clark.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.893
What happened?

36:00.116 --> 36:02.402
I'm really sorry.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.068
I didn't mean to hurt you.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.238
But I wanna be with Lex.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.288
That's not true.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.578
He got to you, didn't he?

36:14.756 --> 36:16.917
Please just believe me and let it go.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.424
Let it go?

36:21.721 --> 36:24.804
Let it go? Lana, I love you.

36:24.975 --> 36:28.092
-I love you.
-C|ark, don't.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.259
Tell me what he did.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.689
What did Lex do?
You don't have to stay with him.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.439
He didn't do anything.
I've made my decision.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.440
I just wanna be with him.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.772
Why do you keep saying that?

36:40.240 --> 36:42.777
Lana, we should be together.

36:43.952 --> 36:47.035
I want this more than
I've ever wanted anything.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.287
And I know that you do too.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.960
I've had a change of heart.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.962
You don't mean that.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.759
Is this because of my secret?

37:10.937 --> 37:13.223
Lana, I'll tell you.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.265
I'm not like everyone else. I'm—

37:16.443 --> 37:19.059
-No, Clark, you have to go.
-No.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.398
No.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.485
Not until you look me in the eye
and you tell me...

37:24.659 --> 37:27.992
...that you'd rather spend the rest
of your life with Lex Luthor...

37:28.163 --> 37:29.653
...instead of me.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.496
I'm sorry, Clark.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.127
I love Lex.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.523
Congratulations, son.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.027
Thanks, Dad.

38:10.205 --> 38:13.493
And why do I get the feeling
that's not all you came to say?

38:13.667 --> 38:15.874
Good to see the euphoria
of your wedding day...

38:16.044 --> 38:17.784
...hasn't tempered your cynicism.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.828
I guess old habits die hard.

38:20.006 --> 38:24.295
And apparently some are next
to impossible to kill, aren't they?

38:27.806 --> 38:31.173
Do you sit up at night
practicing this stuff?

38:31.351 --> 38:33.342
How could you be so stupid?

38:33.520 --> 38:35.886
A grown man on his wedding day...

38:36.064 --> 38:38.305
...and you need me to come
to the rescue again.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.723
You are pathetic.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.858
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.145
Don't play the fool with me, Lex.

38:45.323 --> 38:49.316
There's a crypt down below that
has gotten a little over-crowded.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.748
-It was an accident.
-Of course it was.

39:00.922 --> 39:03.254
You don't have the guts
to plan a successful murder.

39:03.425 --> 39:07.088
And if anyone should discover
that the fresh corpse downstairs...

39:07.262 --> 39:09.423
...happens to be
your bride's physician...

39:09.597 --> 39:11.724
...they just might stumble
onto the truth...

39:11.891 --> 39:13.597
...about Lana's pregnancy.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.929
She's made a desperate man of you,
Lex.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.648
Okay.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.859
You win.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.275
Whatever you want, it's yours.

39:31.453 --> 39:34.786
-Control of LuthorCorp, 33.1?
-You don't have to worry, Lex.

39:34.956 --> 39:37.789
You'll know
when it's time for me to collect.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.210
Thanks, Dad.

39:47.469 --> 39:49.460
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.386
Mrs. Luthor.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.609
Welcome to the family.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.281
[ENGLISH]
