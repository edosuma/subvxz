00:52.660 --> 00:54.788
I told you I wanted to cancel this thing.

00:54.862 --> 00:56.524
<i>Ma'am, you asked for this.</i>

01:25.860 --> 01:28.261
Please, help! Anybody!

01:31.866 --> 01:33.731
Please, just... Please make it stop!

01:33.801 --> 01:37.234
Okay, this is just way too fucking much!
Okay? This isn't what I asked for.

01:37.304 --> 01:38.897
<i>Hold please.</i>

01:39.607 --> 01:41.132
Seriously?

02:09.303 --> 02:11.898
Please cancel it! Stop it!

02:48.242 --> 02:49.505
Shit!

02:52.112 --> 02:53.444
Every... Everything all right, ma'am?

02:53.814 --> 02:56.045
Yeah, yeah, no. I'm... I'm just...

02:56.784 --> 02:58.776
Sorry, I'm just a little bit
flustered 'cause I...

02:58.852 --> 03:01.344
I basically, like, paid for this thing
and then it just...

03:01.422 --> 03:03.448
It turned out to be a really bad idea.

03:05.392 --> 03:06.485
But I'm just...

03:06.560 --> 03:08.025
I'm just trying to get to my car.

03:08.095 --> 03:09.119
Yeah. Listen...

03:09.863 --> 03:15.393
If you see anything strange out here,
my office is right over there.

03:15.469 --> 03:16.698
Don't hesitate.

03:18.105 --> 03:19.198
Okay.

03:21.308 --> 03:23.402
- All right?
- Thank you.

03:26.413 --> 03:27.881
Now, goodnight.

03:49.837 --> 03:52.236
<i>All right, I don't have eyes on her.
I haven't seen her.</i>

03:52.306 --> 03:54.104
<i>I think she's headed to the roof.</i>

03:54.174 --> 03:56.006
<i>10-4, she took the elevator.</i>

03:56.810 --> 03:59.041
- <i>Where is security?</i>
- <i>Something's up with security.</i>

03:59.113 --> 04:02.379
- <i>He just intercepted her.</i>
- <i>So she's headed to the car?</i>

04:02.449 --> 04:03.781
<i>She's already in the car.</i>

04:03.851 --> 04:06.343
<i>She's in the fucking car?</i>

04:43.757 --> 04:45.089
No.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.422
Fuck, no.

04:46.493 --> 04:48.392
Nope. Nope. Nope.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.987
Nope, nope, nope.

04:50.064 --> 04:52.329
God damn it, sunshine! Fuck you!

04:52.399 --> 04:54.197
Fuck you, you 13-year-old son of a bitch.

04:54.268 --> 04:55.633
Don't you got algebra or something?

04:55.703 --> 04:56.966
God damn it!

05:18.692 --> 05:20.320
What the fuck?

05:26.266 --> 05:27.734
Yes!

05:28.235 --> 05:29.863
Come on. Come on.

05:36.343 --> 05:37.709
Boom!

05:58.665 --> 05:59.894
Seriously?

05:59.967 --> 06:01.936
Oh, babe. Get in.

06:03.370 --> 06:04.929
Doesn't look like
the garage has been touched.

06:05.005 --> 06:08.100
No, no, no. I have had a very productive day.

06:08.175 --> 06:10.303
I just thought that
this was the perfect way to end it.

06:10.377 --> 06:12.776
Joe, you said that you would
help out around here

06:12.846 --> 06:14.508
while you were on the hunt for a new job.

06:14.581 --> 06:16.277
I am. No, I am.

06:16.350 --> 06:20.014
Babe, don't get pissed. It's date night.

06:20.087 --> 06:21.521
Date night.

06:23.090 --> 06:24.217
You look great.

06:24.291 --> 06:25.816
Hold on. I'm coming over.

06:32.199 --> 06:34.065
It's not exactly a candlelit dinner.

06:35.936 --> 06:38.633
I mean, how was I supposed to know
it was gonna be this lame?

06:39.239 --> 06:40.263
Check this out.

06:40.340 --> 06:42.502
I guarantee you
somebody's gonna jump out and scare 'em

06:42.576 --> 06:44.340
in three, two...

06:47.281 --> 06:48.579
Look at that.

06:48.649 --> 06:50.277
Genius.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.016
No, okay, okay.

06:55.255 --> 06:57.747
- You go first.
- No, thanks.

07:08.769 --> 07:10.863
Looks like someone has had a long night.

07:10.938 --> 07:12.497
Joe, that's very rude.

07:17.444 --> 07:19.003
Okay, we'll...

07:19.546 --> 07:21.572
We're gonna be moving on.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.649
I read about this online.

07:25.719 --> 07:29.918
Okay, this guy right here,
in the beautiful cape,

07:29.990 --> 07:33.722
was thrown off the Great Wall
right after they finished...

07:33.794 --> 07:35.353
Finished construction.

07:35.963 --> 07:39.229
"Beware, emperor Qin Shi Huang
was murdered by a builder

07:39.299 --> 07:41.996
"while overseeing construction
of the Great Wall of China.

07:42.069 --> 07:43.833
"Anyone who takes a photograph of his body"

07:43.904 --> 07:44.894
"is killed within a week."

07:46.073 --> 07:47.166
Cool.

07:47.241 --> 07:49.206
- No! Don't do that!
- It's so good.

07:49.276 --> 07:51.177
I got the face and everything.

07:51.812 --> 07:52.871
Please delete it.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.105
Thank you.

07:55.182 --> 07:57.548
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:57.618 --> 07:58.881
Joe?

07:58.952 --> 08:01.148
I think I already know the answer
to this question.

08:01.221 --> 08:02.314
- You do?
- But...

08:02.389 --> 08:05.188
Did you ever get back to my dad
about that job?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.192
It sounded like a great opportunity.

08:08.262 --> 08:10.288
No, I did not.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.762
- But...
- Oh, dear.

08:11.832 --> 08:14.825
I was just, you know... I'm gonna find one.

08:14.902 --> 08:17.301
I just don't wanna settle
for the first opportunity that...

08:17.371 --> 08:18.999
You know, that comes knocking.

08:19.072 --> 08:21.371
The main thing is I don't wanna be
taking advantage of my parents.

08:21.942 --> 08:23.807
Look, the main thing
is this place is kinda...

08:23.877 --> 08:26.108
I mean, it was fun, but it just kinda...

08:26.179 --> 08:27.511
It also sucked.

08:27.581 --> 08:29.413
You know, it's just not scary.

08:30.117 --> 08:32.677
Okay, it's not fun, and it is scary.

08:32.753 --> 08:35.152
If you weren't scared,
I don't know how scared you want to be.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.687
I wanna cry.

08:36.756 --> 08:37.850
I wanna cry like the...

08:37.924 --> 08:39.789
Like the last time I watched <i>The Notebook.</i>

08:39.860 --> 08:40.953
I want to just be ripped to shreds.

08:41.028 --> 08:43.259
I want James Garner to destroy me.

08:43.996 --> 08:45.329
Oh, baby.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.868
I just wanna be scared a little bit.
I just wanna shake in my boots.

08:48.302 --> 08:49.292
I'm pregnant.

08:50.470 --> 08:53.770
Does... No... Don't even.

08:55.142 --> 08:56.371
Hey.

08:57.844 --> 08:58.903
May I help you?

09:02.015 --> 09:03.142
This ain't scary enough, huh?

09:05.285 --> 09:06.683
Sorry?

09:06.753 --> 09:08.016
Sorry, I'm not trying to be nosey.

09:08.088 --> 09:11.115
I just overheard you guys saying
this wasn't scary enough.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.450
Couldn't agree more.

09:18.699 --> 09:21.533
If you ever wanna be really scared,
just call that number.

09:21.935 --> 09:23.699
Custom scares just for you.

09:24.504 --> 09:26.666
I promise you will not be disappointed.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.703
Okay, man. Thanks.

09:30.544 --> 09:31.910
You're so welcome.

09:32.946 --> 09:34.608
Okay. Have a good one, buddy.

09:34.681 --> 09:35.740
And you.

09:37.884 --> 09:39.876
That was normal.

09:39.953 --> 09:41.546
Nice and normal.

09:46.526 --> 09:47.925
Baby, I'm positive

09:47.995 --> 09:50.827
that man didn't steal
your phone or your wallet.

09:50.897 --> 09:52.559
He was at our table
for less than two minutes.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.797
Well, I had it to get funnel cake,
and now it's not in the car,

09:55.869 --> 09:58.835
and between that time
a weirdo in a clown mask

09:58.905 --> 10:01.534
who was paid minimum wage
to scare children for a living

10:01.608 --> 10:03.099
came into our lives. So...

10:03.844 --> 10:05.608
You know what?
I bet you left it on the counter.

10:05.679 --> 10:07.045
I'll call them tomorrow.

10:08.148 --> 10:09.673
Hey, Joe.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.946
Joe. Joe.

10:12.019 --> 10:14.045
It's me, Bill, from next door.

10:15.355 --> 10:16.948
I know, Bill.

10:17.290 --> 10:19.623
Well, we sure have missed you at the last...

10:19.693 --> 10:22.185
Let me think,
six neighborhood watch meetings.

10:22.262 --> 10:24.026
I know. Tuesdays are tough.

10:24.097 --> 10:25.759
You know, work and such.

10:25.966 --> 10:27.764
Well, Joe, just think about it like this.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.633
Work is important, yes,
but you know what else is important?

10:30.704 --> 10:31.967
Being part of a team.

10:32.039 --> 10:34.871
A team with the most
important priority, safety.

10:34.941 --> 10:36.842
Yeah, it sounds dramatic, Bill.

10:37.444 --> 10:39.208
Just think about it, Joe.

10:39.479 --> 10:41.072
I will. Scouts honor.

10:41.148 --> 10:43.447
Wait, I didn't know you were a scout.

10:47.254 --> 10:50.315
- Oh, my gosh. This neighborhood's so nice.
- It is insane.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.456
It's insane that it's 90 degrees,

10:52.526 --> 10:55.621
and it's sunny on Halloween.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.530
I mean, come on. Babe, that's weird. Right?

11:00.634 --> 11:02.660
Check out the gate. Look at that.

11:02.736 --> 11:04.830
You got to keep the paparazzi out.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.070
- Hi.
- A Prius?

11:09.142 --> 11:11.108
You drive a fucking Prius?

11:11.178 --> 11:12.669
- Are you... Hi.
- Hi.

11:12.746 --> 11:14.476
Do you hate your freedom, Joe? Is that it?

11:14.548 --> 11:16.413
I mean, do you have any idea
how many people have died

11:16.483 --> 11:18.543
for your right to be gluten free or whatever?

11:18.618 --> 11:21.178
It's great mileage, you fucking asshole.

11:21.254 --> 11:24.087
Give me the tour
before all the kale salad goes bad.

11:24.157 --> 11:25.147
Yeah.

11:25.225 --> 11:26.657
Thank you guys again
for letting us stay with you.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.717
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course.

11:27.794 --> 11:30.025
There's no sense in spending money
on an expensive hotel.

11:31.932 --> 11:33.059
Oh, man.

11:33.133 --> 11:37.161
Your life is different than my life.

11:38.105 --> 11:39.596
Yeah.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.939
You really married up, my friend.

11:43.009 --> 11:44.534
# Blessed.

11:44.611 --> 11:47.044
Come on, man. The "m" word.

11:47.114 --> 11:49.413
Put a dollar in the swear jar, man.

11:50.717 --> 11:51.844
No way.

11:51.918 --> 11:54.080
Honey. They got tetherball.

11:59.126 --> 12:02.858
I was born in darkness.

12:03.497 --> 12:06.524
Okay. I wonder what we break first.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.434
Your spirit or your body.

12:10.504 --> 12:13.133
Time! You suck!

12:13.206 --> 12:14.571
That's... I was Bane.

12:14.641 --> 12:16.006
I was doing Bane. He got it.

12:16.076 --> 12:17.407
I was a good Bane. That was a good one.

12:17.477 --> 12:20.377
It's time for another round
of irresponsible drinking.

12:20.447 --> 12:22.507
Okay, I wasn't sure I was gonna do this.

12:22.582 --> 12:25.245
A buddy of mine gave me
a special birthday present last month,

12:25.318 --> 12:29.016
and, let's just say,
you can sneak anything on a plane

12:29.089 --> 12:30.751
with just a little bit of peanut butter.

12:30.824 --> 12:35.726
Ben, how dare you bring drugs into my house.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.127
Would you like me to...

12:37.197 --> 12:38.562
- That's Bane...
- That's Bane.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.124
Would you like me to break your body
or your spirit?

12:41.201 --> 12:42.533
Just hurt me.

12:43.470 --> 12:46.201
I will, 'cause this is hardcore stuff.

12:46.273 --> 12:47.434
Okay, but in the meantime...

12:47.507 --> 12:48.907
Shots! Shots! Shot! Shot!

12:49.409 --> 12:50.968
- I never take shots.
- You ready?

12:51.044 --> 12:52.842
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12:54.014 --> 12:55.175
You're calling the kids later.

13:04.524 --> 13:06.652
You didn't say the magic word.

13:08.228 --> 13:09.355
- Eddie Murphy?
- No.

13:12.732 --> 13:15.327
- Is that a cigarette?
- No.

13:15.402 --> 13:17.894
When do you guys think
you're gonna get married?

13:17.971 --> 13:19.200
Oh, my God.

13:25.912 --> 13:30.077
Kid, I sure heard a lot about you.

13:30.150 --> 13:33.712
What happened to Natalie on that boat...

13:33.787 --> 13:35.881
Nothin' to do with me.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.458
Are you goin' first or...

13:41.528 --> 13:42.689
No, I thought it was your turn.

13:42.762 --> 13:44.194
Shit, is it?

13:44.264 --> 13:46.324
- It's your turn.
- Okay, okay, okay.

13:46.399 --> 13:49.028
Do you remember me, Eddie?

13:49.102 --> 13:51.501
When I killed your brother

13:51.571 --> 13:57.169
I sounded just like this!

13:57.244 --> 13:58.803
What movies are you watching?

13:58.879 --> 14:01.311
Christopher Lloyd, <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit.</i>

14:01.381 --> 14:02.542
- There's wind!
- Going down!

14:02.616 --> 14:04.585
- There's wind!
- Going down!

14:05.318 --> 14:06.581
Winner!

14:06.653 --> 14:07.916
Okay.

14:07.988 --> 14:11.254
Favorite horror movie death scene.

14:11.324 --> 14:12.917
- Go.
- No.

14:13.393 --> 14:14.656
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.130
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i> Johnny Depp.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.601
Well, <i>Titanic,</i> because she let go of him.

14:23.203 --> 14:24.227
What?

14:24.304 --> 14:27.137
<i>Final Destination.</i> Shower scene.

14:27.207 --> 14:28.197
That's the best one.

14:28.275 --> 14:30.403
Over Johnny Depp being killed by his own bed?

14:30.477 --> 14:31.875
Yes. Or you just love Johnny Depp.

14:31.945 --> 14:33.174
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah, see?

14:33.246 --> 14:35.738
Red wedding. <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

14:36.850 --> 14:37.909
Mic drop.

14:37.984 --> 14:39.916
Not a movie.

14:39.986 --> 14:42.251
What? It doesn't matter, okay?

14:42.322 --> 14:44.621
It's the worst thing
you could ever see with your eyeballs.

14:44.691 --> 14:45.920
It's horrifying, right?

14:45.992 --> 14:49.156
It's the better death scene
than any movie that I have ever seen.

14:49.229 --> 14:51.695
And I have seen a shit ton of movies.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.360
Yeah, and when Joe
was actually living with my family,

14:54.434 --> 14:57.598
every weekend, my parents,
they would buy us pizza

14:57.671 --> 15:00.732
and we would watch a different scary movie
every weekend like clockwork.

15:01.274 --> 15:02.799
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:02.876 --> 15:05.436
<i>Friday the 13th, Elm Street, Halloween.</i>

15:05.512 --> 15:06.571
All the classics.

15:06.646 --> 15:08.111
You know what I mean? Just all of 'em.

15:08.181 --> 15:10.309
I think that's what started
my love affair with this time of year.

15:10.383 --> 15:11.681
I mean, you just can't beat Halloween.

15:11.751 --> 15:13.617
I didn't realize that you lived
with his family.

15:16.356 --> 15:17.380
Yeah, yeah, you know, well, don't...

15:17.457 --> 15:18.922
Don't get all <i>Bambi</i> on me.

15:18.992 --> 15:20.016
It's fine. I'm fine.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.857
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go get some party favors.

15:22.963 --> 15:23.953
God save me.

15:24.898 --> 15:26.025
- What?
- What?

15:26.099 --> 15:27.658
What does that mean?

15:28.168 --> 15:30.501
Every now and again,
he likes to take the party up a notch.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.030
Did you hear that?

15:37.777 --> 15:39.211
I don't know.

15:43.650 --> 15:45.084
Ben, what is that?

15:45.986 --> 15:47.450
I don't know.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.819
- Ben, go.
- All right, all right.

15:51.358 --> 15:52.690
Be careful.

16:12.812 --> 16:14.906
Yeah, it stopped. I don't see anything.

16:20.887 --> 16:22.014
What is wrong with you?

16:22.088 --> 16:24.216
That's not funny! That's not funny!

16:24.290 --> 16:26.156
Holy shit.

16:26.226 --> 16:27.524
That was incredible.

16:27.594 --> 16:30.026
- Joe!
- What?

16:30.096 --> 16:31.792
What? Come on, man.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.494
The <i>Halloween</i> talk? The Jason mask?

16:34.567 --> 16:35.694
I mean, this was too easy.

16:35.769 --> 16:37.634
- You're sick.
- You want a hug?

16:37.704 --> 16:39.366
- Come on, give me a hug.
- No, you're a sick man.

16:39.439 --> 16:40.566
You're a sick man in the head.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.664
Is that a real butcher knife?

16:41.741 --> 16:43.266
Come on, give me a hug.

16:44.110 --> 16:46.306
This has been an ongoing theme for him.

16:46.379 --> 16:49.779
He's been obsessed with scaring me lately.

16:49.849 --> 16:52.785
He even insisted that we have
our weekly date night at this haunted house.

16:53.286 --> 16:55.050
That's not creepy at all.

16:55.121 --> 16:56.145
It wasn't.

16:56.222 --> 16:57.781
But this dude that's...

16:57.857 --> 17:01.316
That's working there,
who said something about this company,

17:02.462 --> 17:05.159
I forget its name, but, apparently,

17:06.866 --> 17:09.332
they create these custom scares for you.

17:09.402 --> 17:11.962
Yeah, but you're also convinced
that he stole your wallet,

17:12.038 --> 17:13.438
which is ridiculous.

17:13.807 --> 17:16.172
Wait... Fuck, wait.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.074
Wait. Custom scare thing?

17:18.144 --> 17:21.637
I... Okay, I am 99% positive that

17:21.714 --> 17:23.808
that's the thing that my boss just did.

17:23.883 --> 17:25.681
- Remember I was telling you about that?
- Yeah.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.550
The scare company, or fear, something, maybe.

17:28.621 --> 17:31.250
- Is that...
- Yeah, Fear, Inc. That's it.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.853
Did they say how it was?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.325
You're kidding, right?

17:35.395 --> 17:37.125
Yeah, people said it was horrible.

17:37.397 --> 17:40.697
You definitely don't want to do this, okay?

17:40.767 --> 17:42.531
You got a crazy look in your eye right now,

17:42.602 --> 17:44.230
and someone as fucked up as you in the head

17:44.304 --> 17:45.294
would not like it.

17:45.705 --> 17:47.401
- Okay?
- Why?

17:47.474 --> 17:48.965
Why did they say it was so bad?

17:49.042 --> 17:50.806
Was it not worth the money or something?

17:50.877 --> 17:53.540
First off,
unless your sugar mama's gonna pay for it,

17:53.613 --> 17:56.079
you can't afford something like this.

17:56.149 --> 17:58.778
Secondly, they, like, hurt you,

17:58.852 --> 18:00.377
like, physically hurt you.

18:01.154 --> 18:03.714
I'm sure emotionally, too,
but physical, like, the...

18:03.790 --> 18:05.816
The company, it's not legit.

18:05.892 --> 18:09.454
And they find people that, like...
People like you.

18:09.529 --> 18:13.660
Okay, who, like, are looking
for something more intense,

18:13.733 --> 18:16.132
and then they just use that as an opportunity

18:16.202 --> 18:19.036
to fulfill their own sick
fucked up fantasies.

18:20.807 --> 18:22.639
What?

18:22.709 --> 18:25.141
This is a fucking haunted house, man.

18:25.211 --> 18:26.304
You guys...

18:26.379 --> 18:28.371
You guys can't be serious, right?

18:28.448 --> 18:29.541
No, dude, you're not get...

18:29.616 --> 18:31.414
You're not getting this
through your head, man.

18:31.484 --> 18:33.416
It's not a haunted house, okay?

18:33.486 --> 18:36.920
I heard that these guys chased my boss
through a parking garage

18:36.990 --> 18:38.922
in the middle of the night.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.323
Okay, I don't know what happened,

18:40.393 --> 18:43.124
but, like, she hasn't been back
to work since.

18:43.196 --> 18:46.166
It fucked her up that much. Okay?

18:49.769 --> 18:53.797
Well, on that delightful note,
I'm going to go to bed.

18:53.873 --> 18:55.364
I think you should, too.

18:56.242 --> 18:57.707
It was really nice to have you guys here.

18:57.777 --> 18:59.040
- Thank you.
- Good night.

18:59.112 --> 19:00.102
Sleep well. Good night.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.547
Hold up, woman.

19:03.082 --> 19:04.414
You guys good?

19:04.984 --> 19:06.748
- Yeah.
- We're great.

19:07.487 --> 19:09.683
- Cool.
- You gonna tuck us in?

19:09.756 --> 19:11.588
- I can tuck you in, buddy.
- No, not standing there.

19:11.658 --> 19:14.321
- Old school. Parents' house style.
- I'm all weirded... No, get out of here.

19:14.394 --> 19:15.919
- No? I remember.
- No, go to bed.

19:15.995 --> 19:17.554
- Corner tuck.
- Thank you.

20:22.195 --> 20:23.254
<i>Hello?</i>

20:23.896 --> 20:25.888
Yeah, is this...

20:25.965 --> 20:28.025
Is this Fear, Inc.?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.729
<i>Yes.</i>

20:30.703 --> 20:32.669
Okay. Well, I got your...

20:32.739 --> 20:36.767
Your card at the
Hollywood Horror House thing.

20:37.343 --> 20:38.708
I guess I...

20:38.778 --> 20:40.940
I just wanted more information.

20:41.714 --> 20:43.376
<i>We got another one.</i>

20:43.449 --> 20:44.576
<i>We can't do it right.</i>

20:45.551 --> 20:48.146
<i>God, it's the third one today.</i>

20:50.023 --> 20:51.389
Okay.

20:52.725 --> 20:54.216
Well...

20:55.695 --> 20:58.927
Where're you located? How do we get tickets?

20:58.998 --> 21:00.557
<i>Hold please.</i>

21:07.040 --> 21:08.668
<i>Sorry, we're sold out.</i>

21:08.741 --> 21:10.801
Okay. When's your next...

21:13.313 --> 21:14.645
Hello?

21:20.586 --> 21:21.918
That's bad. You fucked up.

21:21.988 --> 21:23.980
- I'll clean it up.
- That looks really expensive.

21:24.057 --> 21:25.650
- Wake up.
- What're you doing?

21:25.725 --> 21:28.991
You just come over and break stuff.

21:29.062 --> 21:30.553
You're getting sloppy.

21:31.731 --> 21:33.696
- Take me inside.
- You wanna go inside?

21:33.766 --> 21:36.065
All right. Yeah, we're gonna take you away.

21:36.135 --> 21:38.229
- From here, so you can't break anything else.
- You gonna lift me?

21:38.304 --> 21:39.465
Yeah.

21:39.539 --> 21:42.839
See, look at that.
I'm too drunk to be carrying you right now.

21:42.909 --> 21:45.105
- I got ya. I got ya.
- Careful.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.441
- I got ya.
- Stop there.

21:46.512 --> 21:48.003
Yeah, let's take a pit stop, yeah?

21:48.081 --> 21:49.979
Okay, yeah, that's good.

21:50.049 --> 21:51.073
Yeah.

21:51.150 --> 21:52.482
- There we go.
- You're so bad.

21:52.552 --> 21:53.952
You're so strong.

22:11.704 --> 22:13.366
- Joe!
- Dude!

22:15.174 --> 22:16.938
I heard a crash,

22:17.009 --> 22:21.174
so I thought that
I would come in and see if you were safe.

22:21.247 --> 22:23.112
You look very safe.

22:23.182 --> 22:25.413
Yeah, dude, we're fine, dude.

22:26.786 --> 22:29.449
Do you need anything?

22:29.522 --> 22:30.615
Good night.

22:31.424 --> 22:32.448
Are you gonna tip her or...

22:32.525 --> 22:34.721
No, don't wanna give her the tip.

22:34.794 --> 22:36.820
Or anything like that.

22:36.896 --> 22:38.524
Bye, good night.

22:39.098 --> 22:41.067
I didn't even understand what he was saying.

22:42.468 --> 22:43.731
He's creepy.

22:43.803 --> 22:45.169
Bed?

22:46.939 --> 22:48.669
- He just fucked that up for us, didn't he?
- Yeah.

22:48.741 --> 22:50.767
He really just fucked up that whole thing.

22:50.843 --> 22:52.308
- Thanks, Joe.
- I don't feel so good.

22:52.378 --> 22:54.313
I drank too much.

22:57.884 --> 23:00.183
Where're we going? Which way? This way?

23:23.342 --> 23:25.675
Joe, I'm gonna throw up in your pool.

23:32.919 --> 23:36.014
So this is what you guys do on Saturdays?

23:36.088 --> 23:39.522
You sit by the pool in the hills
drinking margaritas.

23:39.592 --> 23:42.118
By this point in the day,
I'm debating between

23:42.195 --> 23:44.858
UPS or FedEx to ship the kids to China.

23:44.931 --> 23:47.526
You joke. I'm sure
it's an entirely different kind of fun.

23:47.600 --> 23:51.033
Babe, I'm feeling like a real Californian.
I gotta be honest.

23:51.103 --> 23:53.402
'Cause I am one with the universe right now.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.705
I love tofu. Namaste.

23:56.776 --> 23:58.574
Namaste this.

23:58.644 --> 24:00.109
You've been iced, motherfucker.

24:00.179 --> 24:01.738
What're you...

24:01.814 --> 24:03.248
Are you kidding me? I'm not doing this.

24:03.850 --> 24:05.478
Rules are rules, Ben.

24:05.551 --> 24:08.043
And who made the rules? You made the rules.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.986
"It's the rule, Ben."

24:11.224 --> 24:12.954
- Really, babe?
- Come on, come on.

24:13.025 --> 24:14.618
For old time's sake.

24:14.694 --> 24:17.126
For when we were young
and really, really stupid.

24:17.196 --> 24:19.427
All right, okay. Fine, fine.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.525
Come on. Come on.

24:21.601 --> 24:23.729
Fine. But this is for you, okay?

24:25.738 --> 24:27.570
Chug! Chug! Chug!

24:27.640 --> 24:29.802
Come on! Yeah, yeah.

24:29.876 --> 24:31.640
Chug! Chug! Chug!

24:32.745 --> 24:34.475
Look at you go, boy!

24:35.248 --> 24:36.876
God, I can't believe you just did that.

24:38.284 --> 24:39.980
- Are you expecting someone?
- Nope.

24:45.758 --> 24:47.784
Joe, were you out earlier?

24:48.561 --> 24:49.790
No.

24:51.030 --> 24:54.430
Just been in the back most of the day.
Got some friends in town.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.129
- Where from?
- Maryland.

24:58.237 --> 25:00.866
Home of the blue crab,
Cal Ripken, and Edgar Allan Poe.

25:01.574 --> 25:03.304
Yeah, I once spent six months there

25:03.376 --> 25:05.842
doing an Agatha Christie play
out on Chesapeake Bay.

25:05.912 --> 25:06.971
Now that dinner theater was...

25:07.680 --> 25:10.047
What's up, Bill? Why'd you come by?

25:10.850 --> 25:13.445
Joe, I tried calling you earlier,

25:13.519 --> 25:15.485
but you must not have had service.

25:15.555 --> 25:19.617
Now, don't panic, but I saw a guy out front.

25:19.692 --> 25:20.990
He had a van,

25:21.060 --> 25:23.960
but he didn't seem to be climbing
any of the power line poles,

25:24.030 --> 25:27.899
and he sure as heck wasn't wearing
an official DWP uniform.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.595
Okay, that's nice.

25:32.505 --> 25:38.001
Well, I appreciate your concern, Bill,
but it's probably nothin', so...

25:38.077 --> 25:42.173
No, there's something strange going on, Joe.

25:42.248 --> 25:43.910
Keep an eye out.

25:44.350 --> 25:46.682
Will do, will do. I'm on it.

25:46.752 --> 25:48.744
At ease, soldier.

25:52.325 --> 25:54.260
God damn it!

26:03.402 --> 26:06.634
Ben, you fucking around back there?

26:11.077 --> 26:16.243
Okay, well, whoever it is,
cops are on their way.

27:19.378 --> 27:20.903
What the hell?

27:28.087 --> 27:32.047
Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.

27:33.192 --> 27:36.219
Not by the hair of your chinny-chin-chin.

27:36.328 --> 27:39.298
Well, then I'll huff and I'll puff

27:39.699 --> 27:43.136
and I'll blow your house in!

27:46.872 --> 27:50.468
Help! Help!

27:52.611 --> 27:55.672
So, you didn't notice
anything strange before today?

27:55.748 --> 27:58.513
No, the neighborhood has been quiet
ever since we moved in.

27:58.584 --> 28:00.212
Our neighbor actually heads the watch group,

28:00.286 --> 28:02.778
and we're probably the youngest
on this block by about 30 years.

28:03.522 --> 28:07.050
Well, with age comes affluence.

28:07.126 --> 28:10.119
This area's very attractive to robbers.

28:10.196 --> 28:11.721
Yeah...

28:11.797 --> 28:16.394
However, I'm sorta surprised
the guy was so ballsy.

28:16.469 --> 28:18.529
This sort of thing doesn't usually happen

28:18.604 --> 28:21.130
during the day with a car in the driveway.

28:21.207 --> 28:23.301
But, you know what? It's Halloween.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.537
Halloween tends to bring out
some undesirables.

28:25.611 --> 28:26.943
Undesirables?

28:27.680 --> 28:30.343
This wasn't some random fucking robbery.

28:30.416 --> 28:32.314
This guy was fucking crazy.

28:32.384 --> 28:33.749
Okay.

28:33.819 --> 28:36.846
Honestly, that makes it unlikely
it will happen again.

28:36.922 --> 28:38.652
It was probably some homeless guy

28:38.724 --> 28:41.956
who wandered down the wrong street.

28:42.027 --> 28:43.154
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:43.229 --> 28:46.856
Insane people aren't known to do
the same thing over and over and over again.

28:47.967 --> 28:50.266
- Okay.
- Well, look...

28:50.336 --> 28:52.567
If anything else happens, give us a call.

28:52.638 --> 28:56.839
All right? Gonna put some extra units
in the area and we'll see what happens.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.841
Okay. Well, thank you, Officer.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.174
You're welcome.

29:05.684 --> 29:07.516
Nice, Joe.

29:07.586 --> 29:09.316
What?

29:09.388 --> 29:11.220
I'm not fucking lying!

29:28.440 --> 29:32.036
Sorry, <i>Exorcist.</i>

29:32.344 --> 29:33.778
Did you just do that?

29:34.480 --> 29:36.005
Yeah!

29:37.416 --> 29:39.385
Are you crazy? You threw up all over my car!

29:39.752 --> 29:41.015
- Sir, I can explain.
- Are you out of your mind?

29:41.086 --> 29:42.577
I can explain. He's been drinking, okay.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.317
Apparently. Who's gonna clean it?

29:44.390 --> 29:46.018
- I don't know. Not me!
- Are you gonna clean it?

29:46.091 --> 29:48.491
- Babe, come on!
- Here, this is...

29:48.561 --> 29:49.959
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry, man.

29:50.029 --> 29:51.327
Five stars.

29:51.397 --> 29:53.559
- Five stars.
- That's all I have...

29:53.632 --> 29:55.100
I hope that's enough.

30:05.678 --> 30:08.144
Dude, slow down there, Hasselhoff.

30:08.214 --> 30:09.944
Put down the cheeseburger, bud.

30:10.015 --> 30:12.481
- Okay.
- How about some water first?

30:12.551 --> 30:14.483
- I've got a better idea.
- That's a good idea.

30:14.553 --> 30:16.215
Better idea.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.753
Would anyone like some tea?

30:18.824 --> 30:20.122
I would love some tea.

30:20.192 --> 30:21.854
Some nice calm tea.

30:21.927 --> 30:23.395
That kind of tea.

30:24.864 --> 30:28.264
That is a fantastic idea, Joe.

30:28.334 --> 30:30.599
I'm full of great ideas.

30:30.669 --> 30:31.898
Full of 'em.

30:35.074 --> 30:37.100
Here you go... Joe.

30:37.176 --> 30:39.668
Aren't you maybe done for the night?

30:39.745 --> 30:40.872
Just evening myself out, you know,

30:40.946 --> 30:42.378
- I just wanna be a good host.
- Yeah, okay, well,

30:42.448 --> 30:44.440
- now you're nice and even.
- That's all.

30:44.516 --> 30:46.576
- You can just...
- It's great to have you guys here.

30:46.652 --> 30:47.915
Stop.

30:49.655 --> 30:53.558
<i>We're live at the Hollywood Hills
at the scene of a tragic quadruple homicide.</i>

30:55.094 --> 30:56.357
How'd you turn that on?

30:56.428 --> 30:58.556
<i>Three friends were found murdered
in their home.</i>

31:00.332 --> 31:02.631
- Joe, is that our house?
- <i>Witnesses say they were last seen</i>

31:02.701 --> 31:05.034
<i>at a costume party in the Pacific Palisades.</i>

31:05.104 --> 31:07.970
<i>A fourth person, Joe Foster, was with them</i>

31:08.040 --> 31:10.771
<i>and is considered to be the main suspect.</i>

31:10.843 --> 31:14.905
<i>Foster is also suspected
of killing his neighbor, Bill Peterson,</i>

31:15.447 --> 31:19.111
<i>whose body was found outside his home
earlier this evening.</i>

31:20.419 --> 31:23.947
<i>Joe Foster... Main suspect...
Murdered in their home.</i>

31:24.023 --> 31:26.388
<i>Joe Foster... Killing his neighbor.</i>

31:26.458 --> 31:30.486
<i>Bill Peterson. Body was found... Foster.</i>

31:30.562 --> 31:32.494
<i>The motive is still unknown.</i>

31:32.564 --> 31:35.466
<i>And we'll be back with more details
as they come in.</i>

31:38.704 --> 31:40.536
What the fuck?

31:41.640 --> 31:45.441
Joe, for God's sakes!
You have no idea when to fucking quit!

31:46.278 --> 31:50.112
This was really clever.
It's not fucking funny!

31:50.182 --> 31:53.118
There's nobody even out there right now.

31:53.619 --> 31:56.111
That's crazy. How did you do that?

31:56.188 --> 31:57.520
What's happening?

31:58.657 --> 32:00.285
Fuck.

32:00.359 --> 32:02.385
What did you do?

32:02.461 --> 32:03.861
Okay...

32:07.232 --> 32:09.064
Baby, you can't...

32:09.134 --> 32:10.499
You can't be mad at me.

32:10.569 --> 32:12.367
What the hell is going on, man?

32:14.440 --> 32:15.738
Fear, Inc.

32:18.177 --> 32:19.236
What?

32:23.215 --> 32:24.478
I think that's Fear, Inc.

32:24.550 --> 32:26.143
That's Fear, Inc.

32:26.218 --> 32:27.584
What're you talking about?

32:29.655 --> 32:31.987
So... I...

32:32.057 --> 32:36.458
I maybe sort of, maybe,
called 'em a little bit.

32:36.528 --> 32:38.690
And when you were in the bath,
I found my wallet,

32:38.764 --> 32:40.289
and it had the business card in it,

32:40.366 --> 32:41.959
and I went, I don't know, I guess...

32:42.034 --> 32:44.265
I guess my curiosity got the best of me.

32:45.771 --> 32:47.899
I mean, that TV news reporter was legit, man.

32:47.973 --> 32:49.703
What're you doing?

32:49.775 --> 32:52.241
Did you not hear a fucking word
we said last night?

32:52.311 --> 32:54.507
This company is dangerous, man.

32:54.580 --> 32:56.979
Okay, did you give them your information?

32:57.049 --> 32:59.109
No, no, but...

33:01.754 --> 33:03.052
Shit!

33:05.124 --> 33:07.218
They got the breakers.

33:07.292 --> 33:08.691
Okay, this isn't normal.

33:08.761 --> 33:10.923
Let's get out of here.

33:10.996 --> 33:13.090
Keep it together, okay?

33:13.165 --> 33:15.097
Chill out. Stay.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.566
Come on, it's just a power outage.

33:17.636 --> 33:20.299
All we gotta do is flip
the breakers. It's fine.

33:20.372 --> 33:21.635
All right, we can handle this.

33:21.707 --> 33:23.505
This is...

33:23.575 --> 33:26.773
Look, if this is the company,
we're canceling this right now.

33:26.845 --> 33:28.473
Okay, I'll go take a look at the breakers.

33:28.547 --> 33:31.346
- Where are they? Give me the flashlight or...
- Fuck that, man.

33:31.417 --> 33:33.349
This is my thing.

33:33.419 --> 33:35.115
I got this.

33:35.187 --> 33:37.156
Can you just be careful, please?

33:39.191 --> 33:40.284
Don't worry.

33:40.359 --> 33:41.520
I'll be super-duper careful.

33:52.538 --> 33:54.097
Joe...

33:55.240 --> 33:56.333
Joe!

33:58.143 --> 33:59.736
Joe?

33:59.812 --> 34:01.143
Joe!

34:01.213 --> 34:03.375
Joe, I've been trying to reach you.

34:03.449 --> 34:05.111
Bill? What's going on?

34:05.184 --> 34:07.779
I think there's someone on your property.

34:09.388 --> 34:10.719
What?

34:15.226 --> 34:16.752
Shit!

34:23.435 --> 34:25.870
Fucking awesome!

34:33.411 --> 34:35.404
They Barrymore'd Bill!

34:36.748 --> 34:38.614
Holy shit! They got Bill!

34:38.684 --> 34:40.118
Wait, what's going on?

34:41.420 --> 34:42.547
I'm gonna fucking love this.

34:42.621 --> 34:44.715
What'd you mean, "They got Bill"?

34:44.790 --> 34:46.722
He's in on it, too, okay?

34:46.792 --> 34:49.123
Playing this old man version
of Drew Barrymore from <i>Scream,</i>

34:49.194 --> 34:52.322
and this guy with a knife
just fucking killed him or fake killed him...

34:52.397 --> 34:54.195
I don't know, but it started.

34:55.601 --> 34:56.933
We should lock the door.

34:57.936 --> 35:00.428
What? This isn't fucking funny, Joe.

35:00.506 --> 35:03.305
Well, I'm not pranking you, Ben, okay?

35:03.375 --> 35:05.808
Fear, Inc. has started.

35:05.878 --> 35:08.310
The writing on the sauna, <i>Little Pigs,</i>

35:08.380 --> 35:10.813
<i>The Shining,</i> all right,
Bill dying like from <i>Scream.</i>

35:10.883 --> 35:12.977
They're all horror films.

35:13.051 --> 35:15.517
You're a fucking idiot, man. I warned you.

35:15.587 --> 35:18.751
You never take anything seriously,
and eventually, it's gonna...

35:18.824 --> 35:21.487
Okay, we need to cancel this right now.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.960
But...

35:23.829 --> 35:26.128
Joe, call and cancel it now.

35:26.198 --> 35:29.293
Please, Joe, I don't wanna be a part of this.

35:29.368 --> 35:31.030
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

35:31.103 --> 35:32.298
Please, baby, come on.

35:32.371 --> 35:33.930
You and me, we can just do
something on our own.

35:34.006 --> 35:35.599
This just feels like a bit much.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.576
Okay, I can't believe I am doing this.

35:43.415 --> 35:44.405
Thank you.

35:45.317 --> 35:48.650
It's a busy signal. Now, hold on, hold on.

35:48.720 --> 35:52.987
Maybe we just go along with it.

35:53.058 --> 35:55.550
I don't know. And if it gets to be too much,

35:55.627 --> 35:57.323
we can just be like... We'll call 'em...

35:57.396 --> 35:58.694
"Please stop.

35:58.764 --> 36:01.256
"We're a bunch of people
who don't like to have fun."

36:01.333 --> 36:03.029
Okay, it's already too much.

36:03.101 --> 36:05.900
Joe, it's not how this works either.

36:05.971 --> 36:07.803
You can't just tell the company...

36:08.540 --> 36:09.633
I'm gonna call the police.

36:09.708 --> 36:12.473
Not the police. They ruin everything.

36:16.615 --> 36:21.747
Hi, my friend hired this company
to come scare us,

36:21.820 --> 36:23.812
and it's gotten out of control,

36:23.889 --> 36:26.255
and we can't get a hold of them to stop it.

36:26.325 --> 36:28.123
So we need your help.

36:30.028 --> 36:33.521
Yeah, he thought it was something different,
and it's confusing.

36:33.599 --> 36:36.398
Okay, these people... This company...

36:36.468 --> 36:38.835
They're criminals. All right?

36:39.705 --> 36:42.766
Rapists, you know, who knows what else.

36:42.841 --> 36:44.935
I don't think I feel safe here.

36:45.010 --> 36:47.943
You guys are blowing this
way out of proportion.

36:48.013 --> 36:49.478
Great, okay. Yes, thank you.

36:49.548 --> 36:51.312
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

36:51.984 --> 36:53.976
So what? So the fucking cops are coming now?

36:54.052 --> 36:55.543
Yeah, the cops are coming now.

36:55.621 --> 36:58.487
And we have to lock up
the windows and the doors.

36:58.557 --> 36:59.752
What?

37:00.259 --> 37:02.524
Well, what're we waiting for?

37:02.594 --> 37:03.823
Right.

37:07.232 --> 37:10.435
Please let them kill us.

37:26.451 --> 37:27.883
You guys all right?

37:27.953 --> 37:29.444
Yeah? Okay.

37:30.756 --> 37:32.019
You closed the garage, right?

37:32.090 --> 37:33.488
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I locked all the doors.

37:33.558 --> 37:34.719
Did that. Did that.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.593
Shit.

37:37.663 --> 37:39.595
It has begun.

37:39.665 --> 37:41.463
Stop.

37:41.533 --> 37:43.502
Oh, my God. Get down, get down.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.832
Get away from the door.
Get away from the window.

37:51.777 --> 37:52.767
We gotta get out of here.

37:52.844 --> 37:55.370
No, he's out there. I'm not going outside.

37:55.447 --> 37:56.437
But he went that way.

37:56.515 --> 37:59.345
So he's going towards the back
of the house, so we should go out the front.

37:59.418 --> 38:00.943
What about one of the bedrooms?

38:01.019 --> 38:03.750
No, you don't go upstairs.
You don't get trapped in a room.

38:03.822 --> 38:05.450
Haven't you seen any horror movies?

38:05.524 --> 38:06.955
It's our safest bet. He can't get in.

38:07.025 --> 38:10.325
"Our safest bet." Do you wanna die horribly?

38:10.395 --> 38:12.227
No, we can't stay inside.

38:12.297 --> 38:14.696
Ben's right. We gotta get to the car.

38:14.766 --> 38:16.064
Follow me.

38:19.471 --> 38:20.598
Come on.

38:22.140 --> 38:24.109
- A bit dramatic.
- Let's go, come on.

38:29.815 --> 38:31.078
Okay.

38:31.149 --> 38:32.481
Come on.

38:36.722 --> 38:38.554
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, okay.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.625
Everybody in the Prius!

38:43.695 --> 38:45.061
Shut up, Joe.

38:46.531 --> 38:47.863
Lock the doors. Lock the doors.

38:49.735 --> 38:51.260
I see dead people.

38:51.336 --> 38:52.701
- Joe!
- Dude, come on, Joe!

38:52.771 --> 38:55.036
Okay, okay. Wait.

38:55.107 --> 38:56.571
Do you think they'll be able to follow us?

38:56.641 --> 38:58.132
Let's fucking hope not.

39:00.512 --> 39:01.810
- What the fuck?
- Start the car!

39:01.880 --> 39:03.345
I'm trying!

39:03.415 --> 39:05.714
This is why you buy American, Joe.

39:05.784 --> 39:06.945
Joe!

39:07.719 --> 39:10.652
Holy shit! They jacked up my car!

39:10.722 --> 39:13.385
This company is no joke.
We have to get out of here.

39:13.458 --> 39:15.518
- Could we go to the neighbors?
- Yeah, great idea.

39:15.594 --> 39:18.359
- Okay.
- Okay, come on, babe.

39:20.198 --> 39:21.663
You child locked us.

39:21.733 --> 39:23.998
Joe, you child locked us in!

39:24.069 --> 39:27.869
Joe! Joe, we're child locked, Joe!

39:27.939 --> 39:30.807
- How do you not know how to open a door?
- Dude, you child locked us in.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.378
- Come on.
- This way. This way. This way.

39:37.449 --> 39:39.748
- Holy shit.
- Shit.

39:43.522 --> 39:45.514
- It's a fucking ax.
- Let's get back in the house.

39:45.590 --> 39:47.525
- Joe, come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.223
Fuck! Fuck!

39:53.865 --> 39:55.993
Okay. The outside was a terrible idea.

39:56.067 --> 39:57.558
To the bedroom.

40:01.173 --> 40:02.300
Oh, my God.

40:02.741 --> 40:04.835
Where are the police?
They're supposed to be here by now.

40:04.910 --> 40:06.173
Fuck.

40:06.244 --> 40:07.872
Wait. Where's Ash?

40:07.946 --> 40:09.073
I thought she was with you.

40:09.147 --> 40:11.412
Shit. You think they got her?

40:11.483 --> 40:13.816
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

40:14.186 --> 40:16.151
Lindsey, get out of my way, okay?

40:16.221 --> 40:17.382
- Get out of my way right now.
- Come on.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.254
Come on, man.
They're weeding us out one by one.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.923
Every horror movie
needs to stretch out the suspense.

40:21.993 --> 40:24.087
I wonder which one of us will be next.

40:24.162 --> 40:28.190
Guys, whether or not this is a part of it,
we shouldn't go back out there.

40:28.266 --> 40:30.565
No, no, no. Open the fucking door.

40:30.635 --> 40:32.567
- Open it right now.
- Ben, she's gone.

40:32.637 --> 40:34.128
Okay, we can't go back out there.

40:34.206 --> 40:35.799
My wife is out there, okay?

40:35.874 --> 40:37.672
I'm gonna help her. I'm gonna find her.

40:37.742 --> 40:40.302
Listen, listen, listen.
Just please think about it, okay?

40:40.378 --> 40:42.108
We cannot separate. We have to stay together.

40:42.180 --> 40:44.079
Going out there and leaving us
isn't gonna bring her back.

40:44.149 --> 40:45.173
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

40:45.250 --> 40:47.879
Number one rule of horror movies.
Stay together.

40:47.953 --> 40:51.820
If you say horror movie one more time,
I will fucking kill you myself.

40:51.890 --> 40:52.914
Do you understand?

40:52.991 --> 40:54.619
Get out of the way. I'm gonna find my wife.

40:55.460 --> 40:56.792
What did you... How do you...

40:56.862 --> 40:58.091
- Just open it.
- Sliding...

40:58.163 --> 40:59.495
It's a sliding lock.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.564
No, no, you're not going back out there.

41:02.634 --> 41:03.829
Come on!

41:03.902 --> 41:05.530
Can you please call the police again?

41:05.604 --> 41:07.002
They're supposed to be here by now.

41:07.072 --> 41:10.005
Lindsey, I am trying to tell you that
all of this is Fear, Inc.

41:10.075 --> 41:12.101
I don't fucking care. Call them!

41:12.177 --> 41:13.406
Okay, I will, I will.

41:14.279 --> 41:15.804
No, I got no bars. Okay, I can't call out.

41:15.881 --> 41:17.813
- Would you...
- Look, look, look...

41:17.883 --> 41:19.511
Have you seen <i>The Game?</i>

41:19.584 --> 41:20.813
What the hell is <i>The Game?</i>

41:20.886 --> 41:22.184
From the '90s. <i>The Game?</i>

41:22.254 --> 41:24.553
- No!
- Holy shit.

41:24.623 --> 41:26.021
Okay.

41:26.091 --> 41:29.118
Sean Penn buys Michael Douglas a game,
an experience,

41:29.194 --> 41:31.891
and he has to try and figure out what's real
and what's part of the game.

41:31.963 --> 41:33.829
In the end, it's all part of the game.

41:33.899 --> 41:35.891
Yeah, okay, but this isn't a fucking game!

41:35.967 --> 41:37.526
Did you hear anything Ben said yesterday?

41:37.602 --> 41:40.128
Come on, it's David fucking Fincher, man.

41:40.205 --> 41:41.673
Joe...

41:42.307 --> 41:44.572
I get that you are having a good time,
but I am not,

41:44.643 --> 41:46.271
and I don't want to get hurt.

41:46.344 --> 41:48.904
Okay, let's just breathe for a second.

41:48.980 --> 41:50.243
Let's just breathe, okay?

41:50.849 --> 41:54.649
This is turning out better
than I ever hoped it would be.

41:54.719 --> 41:56.153
I know, I know, I know.

41:56.788 --> 41:57.915
I love you.

41:57.989 --> 41:59.651
Okay, I'm listening.

41:59.724 --> 42:01.522
I love you.

42:01.593 --> 42:02.720
You know?

42:04.195 --> 42:07.688
I gotta say, like, isn't this fun?

42:07.766 --> 42:09.792
Seeing you get all passionate.

42:09.868 --> 42:12.167
This is great. Come on, this is fun.

42:12.237 --> 42:13.568
Are you hard?

42:13.638 --> 42:14.936
Look, I just...

42:15.006 --> 42:16.972
You're being such an asshole!

42:17.042 --> 42:18.305
Sorry, I just...

42:18.376 --> 42:20.174
The mood, the lighting, the murder...

42:20.245 --> 42:22.177
It just felt right. I don't know.

42:22.247 --> 42:23.712
I got carried away, okay?

42:23.782 --> 42:25.978
The point is that this is a game.

42:26.051 --> 42:28.282
And out there, that's our best chance to win.

42:28.353 --> 42:30.285
Right now, in here,

42:30.355 --> 42:31.653
we're missing the whole thing.

42:31.723 --> 42:33.453
We are missing everything.

42:33.525 --> 42:35.255
Either way, we're white, we're rich.

42:35.327 --> 42:36.852
The cops are gonna be here any second.

42:36.928 --> 42:38.760
The cops were supposed to be here ages ago.

42:38.830 --> 42:39.957
I don't think they're coming.

42:40.031 --> 42:41.963
Okay, look.

42:42.033 --> 42:43.965
If this is real, all right,

42:44.035 --> 42:45.833
they know we're in here,

42:45.904 --> 42:48.100
and we are just sitting and waiting to die.

42:48.173 --> 42:49.869
All right? And I don't want to do that.

42:49.941 --> 42:51.773
But if this is a game, and I think it is,

42:51.843 --> 42:54.074
then they probably want us
to go out there and play.

42:54.145 --> 42:57.946
Either way, we shouldn't be
sitting here in this room, okay?

43:00.652 --> 43:01.711
Okay.

43:02.487 --> 43:04.581
- Okay?
- Yes, fine.

43:04.656 --> 43:05.646
Really?

43:06.858 --> 43:08.790
That is great.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.886
That's so great. We need a weapon.

43:10.962 --> 43:12.624
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, just be careful.

43:12.697 --> 43:13.687
Do you know what you're doing?

43:13.765 --> 43:15.028
Yeah, I've seen a lot of movies, Linds.

43:15.100 --> 43:16.193
I think I know what I'm doing.

43:16.267 --> 43:18.361
- All right.
- Check this out.

43:19.304 --> 43:20.533
Fuck!

43:21.373 --> 43:23.069
Oh, my God!

43:23.475 --> 43:25.373
God! Fuck!

43:25.443 --> 43:27.275
Well, I hate to say I told you so.

43:27.345 --> 43:30.645
Not now! Not now, okay?

43:31.983 --> 43:33.281
God!

43:37.288 --> 43:38.415
Come here.

43:41.292 --> 43:43.955
Fucking nice, MacGyver.

43:44.029 --> 43:45.292
Okay.

43:45.363 --> 43:46.828
Where is...

43:46.898 --> 43:48.330
Why are there so many bottles in here?

43:48.400 --> 43:51.165
I like to pretend I'm in Narnia.
Sometimes the drinking helps.

43:51.236 --> 43:52.701
You might need a therapist.

43:52.771 --> 43:53.795
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:59.544 --> 44:00.705
Nice, babe.

44:00.779 --> 44:03.044
Okay, here's the plan.

44:03.114 --> 44:06.209
We stay together. You and me no matter what.

44:06.618 --> 44:10.714
Also, we should probably
try to be as quiet as possible.

44:10.789 --> 44:12.382
So, my bad on the yelling.

44:12.457 --> 44:14.153
Now, we go outside.

44:14.225 --> 44:16.922
We get to the door, we should be safe.

44:16.995 --> 44:18.930
- I love you.
- I love you.

44:20.965 --> 44:22.160
- Yes. Of course.
- Do you wanna...

44:22.233 --> 44:23.724
- Okay, thanks.
- Here.

44:24.836 --> 44:26.099
- Thanks.
- After you.

44:26.171 --> 44:27.195
- I love you.
- I love you.

44:27.272 --> 44:29.040
Let's fucking do this. Yeah.

44:33.511 --> 44:35.173
Okay, clear.

44:35.246 --> 44:36.874
Come on.

44:36.948 --> 44:39.914
- Stay calm.
- Can't we just do normal things?

44:39.984 --> 44:42.681
Yeah, next year.

44:44.122 --> 44:46.353
Come on.

44:47.625 --> 44:49.890
Joe, I don't like this.

44:56.201 --> 44:57.464
What?

44:59.370 --> 45:01.999
This is actually pretty scary.

45:03.475 --> 45:06.274
Good job, guys.

45:06.344 --> 45:08.370
Very impressive.

45:19.924 --> 45:21.222
What the fuck?

45:37.342 --> 45:39.504
Wait, wait, wait.

45:42.881 --> 45:44.281
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

45:45.583 --> 45:46.881
It came from the backyard.

45:48.419 --> 45:49.944
Joe, Joe, Joe!

45:53.458 --> 45:54.923
Come on.

45:54.993 --> 45:56.222
Please, let me just...

45:56.694 --> 45:57.957
Come on.

46:04.202 --> 46:06.797
- Jesus Christ, any louder?
- Such a loud door.

46:06.905 --> 46:08.635
I know. I know.

46:16.548 --> 46:18.346
Crazy.

46:25.890 --> 46:27.119
Sorry.

46:44.576 --> 46:45.908
This is so...

46:46.110 --> 46:48.602
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Lindsey.

46:49.080 --> 46:51.412
Quit. That's too much. This is just too much.

46:51.482 --> 46:54.452
- It's <i>Friday the 13th.</i>
- I don't fucking care.

46:54.752 --> 46:56.311
Where are these psychos coming from?

46:56.521 --> 46:58.853
Man, these prosthetics are so real.

46:58.923 --> 47:00.983
- Will you stop it?
- Right, right, right.

47:01.059 --> 47:02.490
Okay, this guy could be anywhere.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.825
So look alive. I'm so sorry.

47:05.096 --> 47:06.427
She's pinned to the tree.

47:06.497 --> 47:08.489
- We can't just leave her.
- Right, hold tight.

47:08.666 --> 47:10.430
We are gonna get you down from here, okay?

47:10.869 --> 47:12.838
Yes.

47:13.838 --> 47:15.101
Just calm down, all right?

47:15.173 --> 47:18.166
Just focus on slow, steady breathing.

47:18.243 --> 47:21.179
He's here.

47:21.980 --> 47:24.040
Run.

47:24.482 --> 47:26.883
No, okay? We won't leave you.

47:27.318 --> 47:28.809
Go.

47:28.887 --> 47:30.480
- Okay, sorry.
- Come on!

47:30.555 --> 47:32.319
Come on. Come on.

47:32.523 --> 47:33.957
Back inside. Back inside.

47:34.225 --> 47:36.319
- In the door! In the door!
- I know! I know!

47:36.394 --> 47:37.885
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

47:37.962 --> 47:39.658
- Close it! Close it!
- I know!

47:45.503 --> 47:46.994
No, no, no. I think they can be out there.

47:47.071 --> 47:48.937
- That's where they got Bill.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!

47:49.007 --> 47:51.272
- Shit, look!
- What're we gonna do?

47:51.342 --> 47:53.174
Don't worry. He can't get inside.

47:57.315 --> 47:59.443
- Fuck!
- I thought you said the doors were locked.

47:59.517 --> 48:01.577
Hey, man, let's just take a timeout, okay?

48:01.653 --> 48:03.417
There's a bat in the bedroom. Go get the bat.

48:03.488 --> 48:04.956
- Why?
- Man, let's just...

48:05.156 --> 48:06.488
Let's just calm down, okay?

48:06.991 --> 48:08.459
We've all had fun.

48:10.995 --> 48:14.022
You have watched
one too many horror films, man.

48:15.466 --> 48:16.957
Okay.

48:18.937 --> 48:20.428
We cool?

48:22.774 --> 48:24.003
Hug it out?

48:34.786 --> 48:36.414
What the fuck, man?

49:11.589 --> 49:13.023
Yes.

49:23.501 --> 49:25.766
Holy fuck, man.

49:26.170 --> 49:27.502
Are you good?

49:29.607 --> 49:31.439
Gosh, this is intense.

49:32.443 --> 49:36.403
Ben, this looks fucking amazing.

49:39.450 --> 49:40.918
<i>Hello, Joe.</i>

49:42.453 --> 49:44.081
Hello...

49:44.455 --> 49:46.117
Jigsaw?

49:46.190 --> 49:49.752
<i>Unfortunately for you, Joe,
I'm not a puppet on a tricycle.</i>

49:49.894 --> 49:51.225
<i>I'm very real.</i>

49:51.295 --> 49:53.958
<i>And so is this experience
you are so sure is a game.</i>

49:54.132 --> 49:56.497
<i>But, who doesn't enjoy games?</i>

49:56.567 --> 49:58.160
<i>Here is yours.</i>

49:58.236 --> 50:00.034
Man. This is too good.

50:00.571 --> 50:02.164
This is too good.

50:03.374 --> 50:06.538
<i>This is your girlfriend, Lindsey.</i>

50:07.845 --> 50:08.904
Man.

50:09.013 --> 50:10.413
Did you know they were gonna do that?

50:10.815 --> 50:12.249
<i>In order to save her,</i>

50:12.383 --> 50:15.581
<i>your friend Ben here has volunteered
to play a game with you.</i>

50:16.754 --> 50:19.553
<i>On this table, lies the necessary tool.</i>

50:20.091 --> 50:22.856
<i>Phase one, the clue isn't in seeable form.</i>

50:23.161 --> 50:25.960
<i>In the original,
his right foot led to freedom.</i>

50:26.164 --> 50:29.726
<i>Today, her life depends on his left hand.</i>

50:30.034 --> 50:31.400
<i>You have two minutes.</i>

50:31.569 --> 50:33.595
<i>Does she live or die?</i>

50:36.808 --> 50:38.242
Okay, okay, okay.

50:38.509 --> 50:39.841
His right foot. Ben's left hand.

50:39.911 --> 50:41.209
His right foot. Ben's left hand.

50:44.048 --> 50:45.380
Original. Original.

50:49.587 --> 50:51.317
Fuck!

50:51.923 --> 50:53.255
Shit!

50:53.524 --> 50:56.358
He had to cut his leg off for the first one.

50:56.594 --> 50:58.495
Do you want me to cut his arm off?

51:05.803 --> 51:07.237
The blade is real.

51:10.508 --> 51:12.204
There's a real blade on this!

51:14.846 --> 51:16.677
- <i>Joe.</i>
- Okay.

51:16.747 --> 51:18.146
Okay, it's a game. It's a game.

51:18.216 --> 51:19.809
- It's a game. Hey, man.
- <i>Joe.</i>

51:19.884 --> 51:21.944
- You gotta tell me. Is this real?
- <i>Joe.</i>

51:22.620 --> 51:24.714
Or is this part of the game, man?

51:25.256 --> 51:26.654
Just give me anything. Blink at me.

51:26.724 --> 51:27.783
Give me something.

51:28.559 --> 51:29.583
Fuck.

51:29.660 --> 51:30.650
I don't know what that fucking means.

51:30.728 --> 51:32.822
<i>Joe. Joe.</i>

51:32.897 --> 51:34.762
All right, no time, no time.

51:34.832 --> 51:36.027
Okay...

51:37.401 --> 51:39.029
Left arm, left arm, left arm.

51:39.103 --> 51:40.230
Right.

51:40.304 --> 51:41.795
David fucking Fincher, man.

51:58.156 --> 51:59.146
Fuck!

52:08.833 --> 52:10.734
This is a fake hand.

52:11.169 --> 52:12.933
It's a fake hand, man.

52:13.804 --> 52:15.295
Holy fuck.

52:16.107 --> 52:17.973
This is fucking intense!

52:20.912 --> 52:22.437
<i>Phase one. Complete.</i>

52:22.580 --> 52:26.813
<i>Phase two. The key to your freedom
lies within your friend.</i>

52:30.221 --> 52:31.621
Where's the fucking key, man?

52:33.791 --> 52:35.191
Where's the fucking key?

52:37.962 --> 52:39.487
Where's the key, man?

52:40.064 --> 52:42.260
<i>Joe? Joe?</i>

52:46.103 --> 52:47.366
Shit.

52:47.772 --> 52:49.240
<i>Joe?</i>

52:52.376 --> 52:53.742
- <i>Joe.</i>
- Key's inside, huh?

52:54.145 --> 52:55.875
Clever girl. Clever girl.

52:56.347 --> 52:57.508
All right.

53:02.186 --> 53:03.449
Let's open her up.

53:07.692 --> 53:10.059
No, Joe, don't do it! No, Joe!

53:10.861 --> 53:12.295
Joe!

53:13.130 --> 53:14.189
Fuck!

53:16.934 --> 53:18.425
No!

53:28.112 --> 53:29.341
Easy peasy.

53:29.413 --> 53:31.245
All right. All right.

53:31.315 --> 53:32.749
Hold still, buddy.

53:45.429 --> 53:47.022
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

53:47.098 --> 53:49.067
That's enough. That's enough.

53:50.768 --> 53:52.168
That's enough.

53:55.673 --> 53:57.574
That's real blood, man.

54:02.780 --> 54:05.340
<i>Joe? Joe?</i>

54:14.692 --> 54:16.285
Ben?

54:16.627 --> 54:18.721
Ben, Ben, Ben. No, no, no!

54:19.330 --> 54:20.992
No, come on, Ben!

54:21.165 --> 54:23.760
No, no, no! Ben!

54:31.309 --> 54:32.572
Ben.

54:36.480 --> 54:39.314
Ben!

54:40.451 --> 54:43.046
Ben!

54:46.157 --> 54:47.625
I'm sorry.

55:25.162 --> 55:28.894
<i>Joe? Joe?</i>

55:30.735 --> 55:31.964
<i>Joe?</i>

55:32.036 --> 55:33.095
Lindsey?

55:41.312 --> 55:42.871
Lindsey?

55:43.347 --> 55:45.111
- <i>Joe?</i>
- Lindsey?

55:45.349 --> 55:46.714
<i>Joe?</i>

55:46.784 --> 55:48.309
- Lindsey?
- <i>Joe?</i>

55:48.386 --> 55:50.514
- I'm coming!
- <i>Joe?</i>

55:52.323 --> 55:53.814
Lindsey?

55:56.160 --> 55:57.890
Fuck, baby! What did they do to you?

56:02.466 --> 56:03.661
Shit.

56:06.437 --> 56:07.996
What the fuck...

56:08.739 --> 56:11.072
I'm gonna call somebody.
I'm gonna call somebody, okay?

56:15.346 --> 56:16.837
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

56:17.014 --> 56:18.175
Yeah...

56:18.249 --> 56:20.581
Someone was supposed to be
here a while ago, okay?

56:20.651 --> 56:22.950
My fucking friends are dead!

56:23.020 --> 56:25.546
- My girlfriend...
- <i>Okay, you need to calm down, sir.</i>

56:25.623 --> 56:27.455
Don't tell me to calm down, all right?

56:27.525 --> 56:28.889
Did you fucking hear me?

56:28.959 --> 56:31.758
My fucking friends are dead, all right?

56:31.829 --> 56:33.263
<i>Officers are on their way.</i>

56:33.564 --> 56:34.759
<i>Is there anyone in the house with you?</i>

56:34.832 --> 56:38.166
<i>I don't know. I saw a couple guys outside
or something like that.</i>

56:38.302 --> 56:40.533
There's... I don't think that
there's anyone in the house anymore.

56:40.771 --> 56:43.866
My girlfriend is here. She's alive, okay?

56:43.941 --> 56:45.406
She's alive, but hurt.

56:45.476 --> 56:47.968
<i>Okay, okay, good. She's alive. Okay.</i>

56:48.779 --> 56:52.213
Listen, just send help, okay, please, please?

56:52.283 --> 56:54.377
Please just send help.

56:54.452 --> 56:55.883
<i>Help is on the way, sir.</i>

56:55.953 --> 56:57.512
<i>Are you sure no one else is in the house?</i>

56:58.122 --> 56:59.590
Yeah, I mean...

56:59.723 --> 57:01.817
I don't see anyone. I think they're all gone.

57:01.892 --> 57:03.861
I think they're all out of the house. Yeah.

57:22.813 --> 57:23.803
Fuck!

57:33.357 --> 57:35.053
You're making a mistake!

57:35.125 --> 57:37.219
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

57:37.294 --> 57:38.956
You asked for this!

58:15.032 --> 58:16.694
<i>Sir, are you still there?</i>

58:16.767 --> 58:18.235
<i>Sir, what happened?</i>

58:18.502 --> 58:21.469
<i>Sir, talk to me. Hello? Hello?</i>

58:21.539 --> 58:23.201
<i>What's happening, sir?</i>

58:23.541 --> 58:24.907
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

58:25.643 --> 58:27.168
No, no, no. There's a...

58:27.244 --> 58:30.043
There was a man in the house, but he's...

58:31.282 --> 58:32.750
He's gone now.

58:33.350 --> 58:34.978
- Baby, what did you say?
- <i>Sir?</i>

58:35.052 --> 58:36.484
<i>You need to tell me what just happened.</i>

58:36.554 --> 58:37.715
Baby.

58:37.855 --> 58:40.051
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Sir? Hello?</i>

58:40.124 --> 58:42.022
Okay, okay. Don't worry, all right?

58:42.092 --> 58:43.856
- Help is on the way. Okay?
- What did you do?

58:43.928 --> 58:45.726
<i>Sir, where is the guy in your house?</i>

58:46.130 --> 58:48.156
There is a guy still in the house.

58:48.232 --> 58:50.664
So, I...

58:50.734 --> 58:52.166
- I killed him.
- Fuck.

58:52.236 --> 58:53.727
- Okay.
- Fuck.

58:53.804 --> 58:54.999
Are you still on the phone?

58:55.072 --> 58:57.404
Yeah, it's the police.

58:57.474 --> 58:58.873
Hang up the fucking phone!

58:58.943 --> 59:00.138
- What're you...
- <i>Sir, did you just say...</i>

59:00.210 --> 59:01.803
Hang it up!

59:02.446 --> 59:04.108
What the hell is going on, Lindsey?

59:11.488 --> 59:12.922
He's dead.

59:13.791 --> 59:15.189
Yeah, he's dead. Okay?

59:15.259 --> 59:17.023
You were right,
you guys were right all along.

59:17.094 --> 59:19.120
These people are fucked up.

59:19.196 --> 59:20.789
They killed our friends!

59:20.864 --> 59:23.527
They didn't! They didn't. Okay?

59:27.638 --> 59:28.936
Okay.

59:45.856 --> 59:48.655
Lindsey, what's happening?

59:49.226 --> 59:51.092
What's happening, I thought this was...

59:51.228 --> 59:52.662
I thought this was a game?

59:55.232 --> 59:58.100
Look at Ben. Did I kill...

59:59.003 --> 01:00:00.471
Did I...

01:00:00.871 --> 01:00:02.269
No, no, no, you didn't...

01:00:02.339 --> 01:00:04.535
This is what you wanted.

01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:08.042
This isn't what I want.
This is not what I want.

01:00:08.112 --> 01:00:10.604
It was Fear, Inc. Fear, Inc. happened.

01:00:10.681 --> 01:00:12.047
That's what's been happening.

01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:15.979
Then why did you guys keep trying to stop it?

01:00:16.053 --> 01:00:19.023
Because we wanted you to believe it was real.

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:23.089
Heyo! Wait, wait. We're done already?

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.356
I thought we were going till,
like, 4:00 or something, right?

01:00:25.429 --> 01:00:30.062
I'm not complaining, but this thing
was really digging into my leg.

01:00:30.134 --> 01:00:31.602
What, really?

01:00:32.369 --> 01:00:33.530
I thought you were dead, man.

01:00:33.604 --> 01:00:35.732
- No, you didn't.
- I thought you were dead.

01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:37.570
No. What?

01:00:37.641 --> 01:00:39.974
So, what, you guys were in on this?

01:00:40.044 --> 01:00:42.775
In on it? I convinced them to do it.

01:00:42.846 --> 01:00:44.007
We knew that you'd love it.

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:45.743
It's fucking awesome, wasn't it?

01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:49.048
- That's...
- We have a problem.

01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:50.178
No, what happened?

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:54.955
What did you do?

01:01:00.798 --> 01:01:02.232
Fuck.

01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:05.363
Is that guy dead?

01:01:05.436 --> 01:01:06.900
Oh, my God.

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:09.201
I thought you two were dead, you know.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.131
What? We're fine.

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:14.541
The only person that's dead
is this fucking actor,

01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:16.944
you fucking idiot, what is wrong with you?

01:01:17.014 --> 01:01:18.744
How was I supposed to know?

01:01:18.816 --> 01:01:20.876
This all didn't seem
a little too much to you?

01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:24.885
All the horror movie shit.
This? You believed this?

01:01:24.965 --> 01:01:27.560
Yeah, I did think it was fake, okay?

01:01:27.624 --> 01:01:29.217
That's why I wanted to do it.

01:01:29.293 --> 01:01:31.853
But then it started to happen
and it was so real.

01:01:31.929 --> 01:01:34.261
I thought I was doing the right thing!

01:01:34.331 --> 01:01:37.301
You guys are good actors!

01:01:38.702 --> 01:01:39.726
Jesus.

01:01:39.803 --> 01:01:42.932
Fuck, they're calling. What are we gonna do?

01:01:43.006 --> 01:01:44.304
Ash, we're getting out of here, come on.

01:01:44.374 --> 01:01:45.865
- But...
- Come on, baby, let's go!

01:01:45.943 --> 01:01:47.206
What? No!

01:01:47.277 --> 01:01:48.905
- Come on.
- You can't leave us here!

01:01:48.979 --> 01:01:51.345
No, these people are actually crazy, Joe,

01:01:51.415 --> 01:01:53.313
and you just took this shit
to a whole different level now.

01:01:53.383 --> 01:01:54.681
Yeah, but we're in this together!

01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:57.244
No, we're not.
You fucking killed one of them, Joe!

01:01:57.321 --> 01:01:58.619
I mean, what do you think
they're going to do to us

01:01:58.689 --> 01:02:00.021
when they find out?

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:05.419
I'm sorry, but these guys
are going to come back

01:02:05.496 --> 01:02:07.428
and we have a family to think about.

01:02:07.498 --> 01:02:08.896
- Come on, baby.
- Let's go.

01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:11.094
No, you can't leave!

01:02:11.168 --> 01:02:12.932
We have to call the cops.

01:02:13.003 --> 01:02:15.969
- Why the hell aren't the fucking cops here?
- That's because...

01:02:16.039 --> 01:02:19.066
That's because
they weren't the cops, all right?

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.804
I'm sorry, what?

01:02:21.879 --> 01:02:23.777
Joe, this wasn't a little gimmick,

01:02:23.847 --> 01:02:25.509
this was a big fucking deal.

01:02:25.582 --> 01:02:28.142
Last week they reconfigured
our entire electrical system.

01:02:28.218 --> 01:02:29.550
They even reprogrammed your phone

01:02:30.053 --> 01:02:33.319
so that all of your 911 calls
go directly to Fear, Inc.

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:38.992
So you're telling me that this whole time
I was talking to one of their employees?

01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:42.226
You didn't think it was at all strange
that nobody showed up here?

01:02:47.437 --> 01:02:48.530
Fuck.

01:02:52.676 --> 01:02:55.703
You're right. You're right.

01:02:56.914 --> 01:02:58.644
This is my fault.

01:03:00.551 --> 01:03:01.883
I'm gonna turn myself in.

01:03:02.486 --> 01:03:03.920
I'm gonna turn myself in.

01:03:04.521 --> 01:03:08.856
And I'm gonna tell them that
you guys had nothing to do with it.

01:03:08.926 --> 01:03:11.054
That this was on me, okay?

01:03:11.128 --> 01:03:13.222
And that they'll leave you guys out of it.

01:03:13.297 --> 01:03:15.789
What did this company expect?

01:03:15.866 --> 01:03:19.233
- What did they expect?
- Okay, Joe, listen. This company.

01:03:19.303 --> 01:03:22.703
They're not exactly
a part of the Better Business Bureau. Okay?

01:03:22.773 --> 01:03:24.901
They're not gonna let us get away with this.

01:03:26.577 --> 01:03:29.543
So are you saying that
we shouldn't call the police?

01:03:29.613 --> 01:03:32.173
Lindsey, we're not gangsters!

01:03:32.249 --> 01:03:34.218
We're not gonna dump the body!

01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:39.650
No, that's exactly what we're gonna do.

01:03:40.624 --> 01:03:42.456
That's what we have to do,
we have to get rid of the body.

01:03:44.161 --> 01:03:48.760
We say it ended at 3:00, that we
had a great time, and then he left.

01:03:49.666 --> 01:03:53.366
We just have to pretend that we have
no idea that something went wrong.

01:03:53.437 --> 01:03:55.335
Ben and Ashleigh, they will vouch for us

01:03:55.405 --> 01:03:57.397
because they don't want this to go
any further either.

01:03:57.474 --> 01:03:59.238
Who would hire a company like this?

01:03:59.309 --> 01:04:00.572
You would!

01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:12.047
Okay, listen. My uncle,
he has this plot of undeveloped land

01:04:12.122 --> 01:04:14.682
in the desert just outside of San Bernardino,

01:04:14.758 --> 01:04:17.455
we're gonna take the body there,
we're gonna dump it,

01:04:17.527 --> 01:04:20.258
and then we're gonna come back here
and pretend like nothing happened, okay?

01:04:22.366 --> 01:04:24.298
I can't believe this is happening.

01:04:24.368 --> 01:04:26.462
I just can't believe this is happening.

01:04:26.536 --> 01:04:28.435
I know, but it is.

01:04:28.505 --> 01:04:30.667
And I have to try and get us out of it.

01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:46.620
- Careful, careful, careful.
- Yeah.

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:48.283
Watch out for the roses.

01:04:51.094 --> 01:04:52.494
Fuck, the car!

01:04:53.997 --> 01:04:56.430
Fuck! Okay, let's go!

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.230
He's gotta have the keys on him!

01:04:58.302 --> 01:05:00.234
Okay, hold him.

01:05:00.304 --> 01:05:01.602
This is disgusting!

01:05:01.672 --> 01:05:04.005
Awesome! Okay!

01:05:06.209 --> 01:05:09.304
Okay, great, you're gonna get the van,
you're gonna reverse it into the driveway,

01:05:09.379 --> 01:05:11.041
and then I'm gonna go get a shovel, okay?

01:05:11.114 --> 01:05:13.242
We're gonna take their van?

01:05:18.388 --> 01:05:20.186
Stop, stop!

01:05:25.595 --> 01:05:27.689
Holy shit!

01:05:27.764 --> 01:05:30.962
These people
take their jobs fucking seriously.

01:05:31.034 --> 01:05:32.933
That's why we have to
get the fuck out of here.

01:05:33.003 --> 01:05:34.596
Okay, come on.

01:05:42.145 --> 01:05:43.977
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

01:06:25.422 --> 01:06:26.720
Jesus Christ.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:27.883
What?

01:06:32.396 --> 01:06:35.491
Oh, my God. They've researched us for weeks.

01:06:35.565 --> 01:06:39.593
They have phone numbers,
pictures, receipts...

01:06:44.608 --> 01:06:47.510
They know everything about us, Joe.

01:07:04.761 --> 01:07:07.026
Fuck! It's Fear, Inc.

01:07:07.097 --> 01:07:08.528
It's fucking them. It's fucking them!

01:07:08.598 --> 01:07:10.464
Okay, fine, just look ahead.

01:07:10.534 --> 01:07:12.901
Just look ahead. Don't look at them.

01:07:23.313 --> 01:07:24.941
- Oh, fuck!
- Fucking shit!

01:07:26.983 --> 01:07:28.508
Okay, see?

01:07:28.585 --> 01:07:31.485
Just some fucking teenagers
on their way home from a party.

01:07:31.555 --> 01:07:34.488
It's fine. Okay, just drive slowly.

01:07:34.558 --> 01:07:37.426
Be safe, be calm, it's fine.

01:07:38.028 --> 01:07:39.792
It's fine.

01:08:13.563 --> 01:08:16.029
Fuck! We're being fucking pulled over!

01:08:16.099 --> 01:08:18.432
Joe! I told you to not do anything stupid!

01:08:18.502 --> 01:08:20.300
How fast were you going?

01:08:21.203 --> 01:08:22.671
Fuck!

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:53.765
In a rush, are we?

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:57.170
I'm really sorry, Officer.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.004
Have you had anything to drink tonight?

01:08:59.542 --> 01:09:01.205
No, no, no. Not at all.

01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:02.939
I've been at home all night.

01:09:04.413 --> 01:09:08.715
It's the middle of the night,
driving recklessly...

01:09:08.785 --> 01:09:11.277
Yeah, it's 'cause we're actually
late for a flight.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:12.845
We were supposed to be going to Hawaii.

01:09:12.923 --> 01:09:14.448
It's a second honeymoon of sorts.

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:16.254
Wow, Hawaii.

01:09:17.627 --> 01:09:18.651
I'm jealous.

01:09:18.728 --> 01:09:19.854
Yeah.

01:09:21.965 --> 01:09:23.830
All right, license and registration,

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:25.528
and I'll make this
as quick and painless as possible.

01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:28.335
Thank you, Officer.

01:09:28.404 --> 01:09:29.737
I guess it's...

01:09:38.048 --> 01:09:41.041
Shit, actually it looks like

01:09:41.117 --> 01:09:44.518
I forgot my wallet at home, Officer.

01:09:44.587 --> 01:09:48.116
How were you planning
on getting on a flight with no ID?

01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:53.656
A young couple, driving an unmarked van

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:57.098
with no license plates
toward the desert this late?

01:09:58.501 --> 01:10:00.231
You got a body in the back of this thing?

01:10:04.507 --> 01:10:06.032
I'm just yanking your chain.

01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:12.945
I'm gonna run this registration.

01:10:13.016 --> 01:10:16.816
Mind if I grab your license, honey,
just to have something to put in the file?

01:10:16.886 --> 01:10:19.412
You know, you won't believe this,

01:10:19.489 --> 01:10:22.823
but I think I've left it at home, too.

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.723
With his.

01:10:24.794 --> 01:10:28.390
Doesn't look like you two
are gonna be going to Hawaii this morning.

01:10:31.668 --> 01:10:34.000
We're fucked. We're totally fucked.

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:36.164
I knew we should have gone to the cops
when this all started!

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:37.571
Calm down!

01:10:37.641 --> 01:10:39.573
Aside from speeding,
we haven't done anything wrong.

01:10:39.643 --> 01:10:42.442
He has no reason to search
the van, all right?

01:10:42.512 --> 01:10:43.639
What if he's Fear, Inc.?

01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:45.645
Joe, he's a fucking cop.

01:10:45.715 --> 01:10:49.616
No, I don't know, my head is all screwed up
from this whole thing.

01:10:49.686 --> 01:10:51.551
What if he's one of them
and he wants to take us back

01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:52.919
to his warehouse and kill us or something?

01:10:52.989 --> 01:10:54.514
Okay, you have to stop.

01:10:54.591 --> 01:10:56.423
This is just gonna make things worse.

01:10:56.493 --> 01:10:59.426
We're going to be fine,
we haven't done anything wrong.

01:10:59.496 --> 01:11:01.556
All right? Okay, stay calm.

01:11:07.737 --> 01:11:11.638
Tell me, Mr. Foster,
what is Customized Events, LLC,

01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:15.008
and why are you driving
their van to the airport?

01:11:15.078 --> 01:11:17.809
It's my brother's company.
You know, when I...

01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:21.318
My car's in the shop
and he lets me borrow one of their vans.

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.012
How did you know my name?

01:11:26.089 --> 01:11:27.988
Sir, you need to calm down.

01:11:28.058 --> 01:11:32.223
No, I never told you my name,
and I never gave you my license.

01:11:32.295 --> 01:11:33.820
Calm down, sir.

01:11:33.897 --> 01:11:37.264
What precinct exactly are you working with?

01:11:37.334 --> 01:11:39.530
I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

01:11:48.645 --> 01:11:49.738
Go, go, go!

01:11:49.813 --> 01:11:51.645
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:12:22.679 --> 01:12:24.238
This is so fucked up.

01:12:27.684 --> 01:12:29.744
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:30.754 --> 01:12:32.484
Joe...

01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:34.251
Okay.

01:12:34.324 --> 01:12:38.056
All right, on three, I guess, okay?

01:12:38.128 --> 01:12:39.926
Yeah. Oh, God!

01:12:39.996 --> 01:12:41.658
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:43.131
Real quick.

01:12:46.169 --> 01:12:47.728
Did you hear that?

01:12:49.873 --> 01:12:51.899
- Is that...
- What?

01:12:51.975 --> 01:12:53.238
How the fuck did they find us?

01:12:53.309 --> 01:12:55.073
Oh, my God, there's gotta be GPS in the van.

01:12:55.879 --> 01:12:57.811
Joe, what do we...

01:12:57.881 --> 01:13:00.043
This way. Run, run!

01:13:03.253 --> 01:13:05.085
Get down! Get down!

01:13:12.695 --> 01:13:15.859
What are they gonna do?
What are they gonna do?

01:13:41.424 --> 01:13:42.756
Joe!

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.189
We know you're out here, Joe!

01:13:47.897 --> 01:13:49.195
I'll make you a deal.

01:13:49.899 --> 01:13:53.165
Come on out, we let the princess live.

01:13:56.639 --> 01:13:59.165
Abe, you hear that?

01:14:04.514 --> 01:14:06.244
It's getting late and I need my beauty sleep.

01:14:06.749 --> 01:14:08.479
What do you say?

01:14:08.551 --> 01:14:13.012
Just turn yourself over and she goes home,
safe and sound.

01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:20.195
Last chance.

01:14:20.997 --> 01:14:23.057
Show her you still
got those tiny little balls

01:14:23.132 --> 01:14:24.760
she first fell in love with.

01:14:26.102 --> 01:14:28.071
What's it gonna be, Joe?

01:14:28.771 --> 01:14:32.936
I'm gonna go. I love you.

01:14:33.009 --> 01:14:34.170
No!

01:14:34.244 --> 01:14:35.268
Joe!

01:14:36.379 --> 01:14:38.211
No, man... Fuckin'...

01:14:39.749 --> 01:14:41.183
- No!
- Don't...

01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:44.814
Wow, Joe. Boyfriend of the year.

01:14:44.888 --> 01:14:46.413
Look, man, it was an accident.

01:14:46.489 --> 01:14:49.456
- Quiet!
- It was just a mistake.

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:50.892
Check him.

01:15:00.603 --> 01:15:01.593
Easy.

01:15:03.172 --> 01:15:04.902
Easy, Cat.

01:15:19.088 --> 01:15:21.057
You people.

01:15:22.191 --> 01:15:25.787
You think you can do whatever you want,
with no repercussion.

01:15:25.862 --> 01:15:27.330
No, it's not true, man. We thought he...

01:15:29.532 --> 01:15:30.591
We thought the guy...

01:15:30.667 --> 01:15:34.900
Tom, his name was Tom!
Did you know he had a wife?

01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:36.302
That he had a fucking daughter?

01:15:36.372 --> 01:15:37.837
I thought he was gonna kill her, man.

01:15:37.907 --> 01:15:39.272
I thought he was gonna kill her.

01:15:39.342 --> 01:15:42.073
That's the service you paid us for.
You called us!

01:15:42.145 --> 01:15:44.239
No, we tried! I tried!

01:15:44.314 --> 01:15:46.279
But you guys said it was sold out.

01:15:46.349 --> 01:15:49.877
All right, when it started,
yeah, I played along.

01:15:49.953 --> 01:15:52.385
What kind of fucked up
company do you guys run?

01:15:52.455 --> 01:15:54.287
You made me think that I killed my friend.

01:15:54.357 --> 01:15:57.290
It was a fucking plastic hand.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.829
You're the horror buff, Joe.
You should have known!

01:16:01.864 --> 01:16:03.763
Please, man you gotta stop, okay?

01:16:03.833 --> 01:16:05.631
It was just an accident, man.

01:16:05.902 --> 01:16:08.872
- Tie him up.
- It's a fucking accident!

01:16:12.475 --> 01:16:14.467
You took my friend's last breath.

01:16:14.544 --> 01:16:16.274
Now we're gonna take hers.

01:16:18.915 --> 01:16:20.713
Lindsey!

01:16:26.222 --> 01:16:27.656
Lindsey!

01:16:32.428 --> 01:16:34.090
Lindsey!

01:16:34.163 --> 01:16:35.187
Let's go!

01:16:36.132 --> 01:16:37.896
Oh, God!

01:17:09.298 --> 01:17:10.857
Oh, God!

01:17:16.572 --> 01:17:19.371
No, no, no.

01:17:26.616 --> 01:17:29.279
Please, no.

01:18:40.022 --> 01:18:41.456
No.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.290
Can I help you?

01:20:59.362 --> 01:21:02.457
Do you have a phone I could use?

01:21:02.531 --> 01:21:05.228
Yeah, we got a phone,
but I'm gonna first need you

01:21:05.301 --> 01:21:07.667
to tell me who you are and what happened.

01:21:07.737 --> 01:21:08.966
Some guys...

01:21:10.673 --> 01:21:14.303
They killed my girlfriend

01:21:15.211 --> 01:21:17.677
out there in the desert.

01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:20.179
I walked here, I just...

01:21:20.249 --> 01:21:23.913
Please... Just please can I use your phone?

01:21:35.464 --> 01:21:37.365
Phone's on the counter.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.162
<i>Was that scary enough for you?</i>

01:22:13.235 --> 01:22:14.533
What?

01:22:18.074 --> 01:22:19.133
Hi.

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:24.377
Oh, my God, baby. You're alive.

01:22:24.447 --> 01:22:25.642
You're all right.

01:22:25.715 --> 01:22:28.378
I am. And you are.

01:22:28.451 --> 01:22:30.443
And you did it, you did it.

01:22:31.988 --> 01:22:34.420
I missed you, too.

01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:36.686
Wait, wait, what do you mean?

01:22:36.759 --> 01:22:37.818
What did I do?

01:22:37.893 --> 01:22:41.421
What did I... I'm sorry, what's going on?

01:22:41.497 --> 01:22:43.523
This is all part of our package.

01:22:43.599 --> 01:22:47.400
I'm sorry. What? What...

01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:48.961
Are you fucking serious?

01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:52.300
Yeah, I told them how obsessed you were
with horror movies,

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:53.739
and they took it from there,

01:22:53.809 --> 01:22:55.573
they've catered this whole thing to you!

01:22:55.644 --> 01:22:57.545
But, so...

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:03.312
That means that everything...

01:23:03.386 --> 01:23:06.379
That was planned?

01:23:06.455 --> 01:23:08.447
- That was...
- Hey, Joe.

01:23:10.693 --> 01:23:11.683
Fuck!

01:23:11.761 --> 01:23:13.753
It's okay.

01:23:13.829 --> 01:23:15.422
Welcome to the wrap party.

01:23:16.866 --> 01:23:18.764
How you feeling, dude?

01:23:18.834 --> 01:23:21.360
Pete, turn up the lights and get some brews,

01:23:21.437 --> 01:23:23.402
cast and crew is on their way.

01:23:23.472 --> 01:23:26.442
After 48 hours of this,
we need to decompress.

01:23:35.618 --> 01:23:37.382
Come on, sit down.

01:23:38.354 --> 01:23:40.219
Right there.

01:23:40.289 --> 01:23:42.281
This is crazy.

01:23:42.358 --> 01:23:45.760
Does that mean that Ben and Ashleigh,
they were in on everything, too?

01:23:48.497 --> 01:23:50.693
Are you kidding me?
Look at you. He's still scared!

01:23:50.766 --> 01:23:52.131
What is wrong with you?

01:23:52.201 --> 01:23:54.830
You know what hand this is?
This is my lovemaking hand, Joe.

01:23:55.371 --> 01:23:58.102
Oh, my God. I fucking hate you.

01:23:59.241 --> 01:24:01.540
Well, that was an experience.

01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:02.908
An experience?

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.146
This was a fucking nightmare is what it was.

01:24:07.216 --> 01:24:08.809
Surprise.

01:24:16.258 --> 01:24:21.196
So, you guys knew everything
that was gonna happen?

01:24:21.764 --> 01:24:24.461
Kind of. We had this bullet-point version,

01:24:24.533 --> 01:24:26.161
but most of it was just improv.

01:24:26.235 --> 01:24:29.899
Not knowing everything probably made it
all much more believable, right?

01:24:29.972 --> 01:24:32.066
Even when I knew when something
was going to happen,

01:24:32.141 --> 01:24:34.006
it still ended up scaring the shit out of me.

01:24:34.076 --> 01:24:35.305
Yeah.

01:24:35.377 --> 01:24:39.211
So you guys just made up all that stuff
about them being crazy?

01:24:39.281 --> 01:24:40.408
What? No. Dude.

01:24:40.483 --> 01:24:43.453
These people are really fucked up, man.

01:24:45.087 --> 01:24:46.552
But I knew you'd love it, all right?

01:24:46.622 --> 01:24:49.421
Come on, these people
are fucking degenerates.

01:24:49.492 --> 01:24:51.256
You gotta be a little off to do this.

01:24:51.327 --> 01:24:55.059
Yeah, to be honest, I'm just glad
that it's over and that no one got hurt.

01:24:55.764 --> 01:24:58.130
There were times when
I definitely started to question them.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.862
Yeah.

01:25:00.703 --> 01:25:05.073
And to think,
these guys do this every fucking week.

01:25:09.512 --> 01:25:13.381
Ladies and gentlemen,
we meet here once again.

01:25:14.416 --> 01:25:17.316
For the past eight years,
all over the country,

01:25:17.386 --> 01:25:21.287
a few of the privileged
have hired our little gang of misfits

01:25:21.357 --> 01:25:23.724
to create an experience they'll never forget.

01:25:24.393 --> 01:25:27.625
And you know what, they never have.

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:31.897
No matter what the situation,
or how big the project we're working on,

01:25:31.967 --> 01:25:35.460
you all give it 110% every time.

01:25:37.473 --> 01:25:42.002
Tonight's victim, Joe Foster,
gave us quite a fight.

01:25:43.312 --> 01:25:45.713
It's impressive to make
it out of a horror movie alive.

01:25:46.515 --> 01:25:48.040
But to make it out of several,

01:25:48.117 --> 01:25:51.144
well, that's quite a feat.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.384
I'll leave you with a quote
from one of my favorite movies.

01:25:54.456 --> 01:25:58.359
"You are the disease, and I'm the cure."

01:26:10.272 --> 01:26:11.262
All right.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.470
I get it. Is this time for the gangbang,

01:26:15.544 --> 01:26:17.137
is that what's about to happen?

01:26:20.649 --> 01:26:23.312
Wait, why do I know this?

01:26:33.095 --> 01:26:34.222
Let go!

01:26:34.296 --> 01:26:36.424
- Lindsey!
- Joe, Joe!

01:26:40.603 --> 01:26:42.868
Joe, you didn't think we'd let you leave

01:26:42.938 --> 01:26:45.905
without experiencing
your all-time favorite death scene?

01:26:45.975 --> 01:26:47.102
Joe!

01:26:47.176 --> 01:26:48.667
Please let her go!

01:26:49.211 --> 01:26:50.702
No!

01:27:04.727 --> 01:27:06.753
Cut to black, bitch.

01:27:33.789 --> 01:27:35.553
Hello?

01:27:38.327 --> 01:27:43.197
Well, I'm so sorry, we're sold out.

01:27:46.468 --> 01:27:48.562
Got another one, boys!

01:27:49.305 --> 01:27:55.620
