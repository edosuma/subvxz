Stark himself could always be found
shoulder to shoulder...

a pickax in his strong hands.

the king Chandler from his throne.

was recently asked about the rivalry.

"We're not worried.

17:12.407 --> 17:15.617
...Stark was reported to reply simply,
"We'll see."

Here's more on Chandler and Jeffers,
and something really strange.

17:22.208 --> 17:26.211

went missing back in 1925.

-Why is the date so important?
-It's not.

32:44.338 --> 32:45.713
Unless it's the wrong date.

32:53.013 --> 32:55.848
Myron Stark was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.320
"If we cry because the sun
has gone out of our lives...

33:09.488 --> 33:12.865
...our tears can prevent us
from seeing the stars."

Chandler's eulogy for his son?

33:16.536 --> 33:19.163
"Today is a day for mourning,
but it is also a day...

33:19.331 --> 33:23.292
...to remember my son,
a gifted young man with a grand heart.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.837
A budding architect,
his dream was to build Pico Tower...

33:27.005 --> 33:28.923
...on the corner of Third and Pico.

33:29.091 --> 33:32.385
That was his land, the soil where
his dreams were to take root.

33:32.552 --> 33:36.430
It will remain his land forever,
never to be sold or developed.

33:36.598 --> 33:40.476
Instead, his legacy will live on,
in a memorial garden...

33:40.644 --> 33:42.937
...I will plant there in his honor."

33:43.146 --> 33:44.897
That can't be right.

33:45.065 --> 33:49.151
There is a Pico Tower in downtown L.A.
It's an architectural landmark.

33:49.319 --> 33:52.446
We took a field trip there in third grade.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.073
Someone must have built it.

They show Chandler's rivalry

34:03.750 --> 34:06.293
His business went under in July 1925.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.004
His assets were auctioned off
to pay off his debt...

34:09.172 --> 34:11.340
...including the property at Third and Pico.

34:11.508 --> 34:16.554
Bankruptcy, tragic accidents,
the death of a beloved son.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.681
It's like the family's cursed.

34:22.394 --> 34:25.938
-Mr. Chandler, I'm Myron Stark.
-Do I know you?

34:26.106 --> 34:30.067
-No, you don't know me.
-Mr. Chandler's in a hurry.

34:31.653 --> 34:34.822
I'm interested
in purchasing a piece of property.

34:35.615 --> 34:37.366
Third and Pico.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.454
-That land's not for sale.
-I'll pay twice what it's worth.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.749
Are you deaf? He said it's not for sale.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.806
Does it say who bought it?
The Pico property?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.103
CAMERON: "M.S."
ERIC: Stark?

35:06.271 --> 35:09.273
So he not only bought the land,
but he designed it himself?

35:09.441 --> 35:12.651
-The building. It's about the building.
-What is?

35:12.819 --> 35:15.529
Stark accidentally killed the man
who was gonna build it.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.156
So he had to build it himself.

35:17.324 --> 35:21.118
Everything he did was to drive Chandler
under and get him to sell that land.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.411
Okay.

35:23.413 --> 35:26.040
There must be a reason
why Stark needed to build it.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.171
You wanna know the really weird thing?

35:32.339 --> 35:35.049
Stark disappeared
two weeks before the building opened...

35:35.217 --> 35:37.635
-...in May of 1927.
-Disappeared?

35:37.803 --> 35:39.303
Fell off the face of the earth.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.972
-Never seen again.
-What's happened at Pico Tower...

35:42.140 --> 35:44.475
...since it was built? Anything important?

35:44.643 --> 35:47.478
-Anything on New Year's Eve?
-New Year's Eve when?

35:47.646 --> 35:50.147
-Any New Year's Eve.
-Not that I can see.

35:50.315 --> 35:54.318
In fact, it's closed now. They had to
retrofit after the last earthquake.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.695
I'm not sure when they're reopening.

What are you doing back here?

39:26.948 --> 39:28.073
Are you all right?

39:28.283 --> 39:30.743
-What happened?
-I'm fine.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.454
-Your brother again?
-I'm fine.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.916
You never touched your doughnuts.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.209
I wasn't hungry.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.045
Your muscles are weak.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.756
It was difficult for you to pull the trigger.

39:43.923 --> 39:47.009
You've lost 8 percent of your body weight
in the past two weeks.

39:47.177 --> 39:50.179
When I carried you to the film vault,
I weighed you.

Wait. What?

This whole night, the entire time,
you've been examining me?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.812
What the hell is going on here?

39:59.564 --> 40:01.523
Your cancer's back.

40:01.691 --> 40:04.902
You have a secondary tumor
in the long bone of your arm...

40:05.070 --> 40:06.570
...and possibly your lungs.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.615
-Are you joking?
-No.

No wonder you don't have any friends.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.340
You can't just do things like that.

40:26.508 --> 40:29.176
You can't just show up
whenever you need something.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.637
You can't carry a gun
and freak people out...

40:31.846 --> 40:34.515
...and walk in the bathroom
when a guy's taking a leak...

40:34.682 --> 40:37.559
...and ask him if he's gonna kill himself.

40:37.727 --> 40:41.855
And you can't just blurt things out
like, "You have cancer."

Especially to someone
who's already had it.

He works the night shift. He lets me in.
