00:08.791 --> 00:10.619
MOTHER:
Hit it again, Brandon.

00:10.662 --> 00:11.707
[grunts]

00:12.012 --> 00:13.448
Board two, Brandon zero.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.754
[chuckles]Shh.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.323
Board two, Brandon zero.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.585
[both chuckle]

00:20.629 --> 00:21.978
Riley.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.675
Is it confirmed?

00:23.719 --> 00:24.633
Remember Bilal?

00:24.676 --> 00:25.634
Scooter's interpreter?

00:25.677 --> 00:26.722
Yeah, he confirmed it.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.116
He's in Herat.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.421
Hazel's up next.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.119
The Taliban took Herat.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.774
I thought you said that
wasn't going to happen.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.080
I did.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.517
It's okay, go help Al.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.042
[Brandon grunts]

00:45.697 --> 00:47.177
What's going on?

00:47.221 --> 00:48.961
The Taliban took Herat.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.572
Kabul might be next,

00:50.615 --> 00:52.530
and Al's family's there.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.358
Hassina, salaam,
how is Kabul?

00:54.402 --> 00:55.620
What do people say?

00:55.664 --> 00:57.448
HASSINA:
We're okay, we're just scared.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.885
Don't worry, Riley and I will
find you an earlier flight.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.104
In other cities,

01:01.148 --> 01:02.801
the Taliban are going
door to door

01:02.845 --> 01:04.629
looking for people
who worked with foreigners.

01:04.673 --> 01:05.630
I worked with the U.N.

01:05.674 --> 01:06.805
Hassina, listen to me.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.111
Nothing is going
to happen to you.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.287
You have a visa,
you will be safe in Turkey.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.246
But we were making
progress here.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.117
[crying]:
Now it's all disappearing

01:14.161 --> 01:15.727
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.729
[phone chimes]

01:17.773 --> 01:19.035
Hey, I got Todd.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.819
Hold on a minute, Hassina.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.038
What do you got?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.431
TODD: They're deploying
Marines to Kabul.

01:23.474 --> 01:24.823
What for? What's the mission?

01:24.867 --> 01:26.695
I heard evac,
but I-I don't know.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.089
[sighs] All right, call me back
when you know more.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.307
Copy that.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.702
HASSINA: Did he say
they're sending the Marines?

01:34.485 --> 01:35.573
Yes.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.749
To evacuate us?

01:42.189 --> 01:44.060
They're not coming for you.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.803
â™ª

01:58.118 --> 02:00.511
[Al speaking Dari]

02:04.254 --> 02:06.256
Hold on, guys, I can get her
to India leaving tomorrow.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.692
No, she only has
a visa to Turkey.

02:07.736 --> 02:08.911
Can't she get a new one?

02:08.954 --> 02:11.000
No, baby, it took months
to get this one.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.571
I got chicken nuggets.

02:16.614 --> 02:17.572
Thank you, Art.

02:17.615 --> 02:18.790
I am not hungry.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.140
Why are we
only looking for tickets

02:20.183 --> 02:22.577
for Hassina? What about
the rest of your family?

02:22.620 --> 02:24.970
They are not in as much danger
as my sister.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.495
Besides, they don't have
any way to leave.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.366
A seat opened up
on the Monday flight.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.716
Are you sure?Go Dad!

02:31.760 --> 02:33.588
You don't have it
memorized?

02:33.631 --> 02:35.416
It's like 40 numbers.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.200
[typing]

02:37.244 --> 02:38.245
[beep]

02:38.288 --> 02:40.290
Damn it, declined.
Let me call 'em.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.509
Don't lose that seat.

02:41.552 --> 02:42.901
Hazel, my purse.

02:42.945 --> 02:47.036
Dad, don't get mad,
but we have a corporate Amex.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.037
Since when?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.169
Five years?

02:49.212 --> 02:50.735
How much debt have you run up?

02:50.779 --> 02:51.519
Zero.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.521
Oh, good looking out.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.045
[beep]Got it! [laughs]

02:56.088 --> 02:57.568
[cheering and laughter]

02:57.612 --> 03:01.572
Hmm, wow, this is heavy.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.532
[sighs]

03:04.575 --> 03:06.577
NEWSWOMAN: In other news,
we can now confirm

03:06.621 --> 03:09.928
that Herat is under the full
control of the Taliban.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.930
This is their biggest gain
thus far

03:11.974 --> 03:13.236
in their weeklong assault...

03:13.280 --> 03:14.933
[scoffs] Are they allowed
to call it news

03:14.977 --> 03:16.500
if it happened
two days ago?

03:16.544 --> 03:17.545
[turns TV off]

03:17.588 --> 03:18.633
[sighs]

03:18.676 --> 03:20.025
So, how you doing?

03:21.984 --> 03:24.639
Fine. How are you doing?

03:26.858 --> 03:28.295
Fine.

03:29.078 --> 03:33.256
Okay, now we have established
that we're both lying.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.390
[sighs] I didn't think it was
going to happen this fast.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.695
No one did.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.828
Someone must have made a deal.

03:39.871 --> 03:42.396
We just need Kabul
to hang on for three days.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.180
Long enough to get
your sister out.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.921
Inshallah.

03:49.446 --> 03:52.101
But my mother
will still be there,

03:52.144 --> 03:53.885
my nieces and nephews.

03:55.060 --> 03:58.368
They will ban music again,
no school for girls.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.371
[both sigh]

04:01.415 --> 04:02.546
Have I ever told you

04:02.590 --> 04:04.287
that we were not allowed
to fly kites

04:04.331 --> 04:06.246
under the Taliban?

04:06.289 --> 04:07.682
Why not?

04:07.725 --> 04:10.032
They said there were
angels flying in the sky

04:10.075 --> 04:12.426
and our kites
were harassing them.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.602
[scoffs]

04:16.386 --> 04:17.909
Boy...

04:17.953 --> 04:19.694
I know it's not an option,
but I really wish

04:19.737 --> 04:21.522
you could get drunk right now.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.885
What are you doing up?

04:36.928 --> 04:39.540
Wait 30 years, you'll find out.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.063
What's with the faces?

04:41.106 --> 04:44.371
My cousin Zubair heard
gunshots near the palace,

04:44.414 --> 04:48.200
and there are rumors that
the government is falling apart.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.593
What does that mean?

04:50.420 --> 04:52.379
It means it's over.

04:52.422 --> 04:56.383
If there is no government, there
is nothing stopping the Taliban.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.819
What about all the interpreters?

04:57.862 --> 04:59.951
How the hell
we gonna get 'em out?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.126
It's messed up.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.172
Hassina.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.043
We got to focus on Hassina.

05:05.087 --> 05:05.957
ART:
All right.

05:06.001 --> 05:09.831
So, uh, so what are the options?

05:09.874 --> 05:11.398
She leaves in 30 hours.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.487
We cannot get her on
an earlier flight.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.749
Maybe we can get her
to the airport.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.272
Isn't that where
all the Marines are?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.969
I'm worried that is where
the Taliban are going to attack.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.841
And everybody might be
rushing to the airport.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.670
Yeah, right, large crowds
are always a target.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.586
Hopefully she has time.

05:25.629 --> 05:28.719
Does she have 30 hours?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.288
Who knows?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.942
[helicopter blades whirring]

[music playing faintly]

05:35.987 --> 05:38.207

05:42.472 --> 05:43.865
As-salaam, Hassina Jaan.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.257
How was your first day
at work?

05:45.301 --> 05:46.476
HASSINA:
Amazing.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.304
We vaccinated a whole village.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.393
I've never been so happy
making children cry.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.439
[laughs]
I'm ready to cry.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.484
This, this is beautiful.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.617
Hey, guys, mail came.
Brownies.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.314
Hey, Todd, Al's
on the phone.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.794
I am so proud of you.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.796
I told Mother
I had the best day of my life,

06:01.839 --> 06:03.014
and what do you think she said?

06:03.058 --> 06:04.189
The best day of your life
will be

06:04.233 --> 06:05.800
when you give her
a grandchild.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.279
[chuckles]
Exactly.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.803
Score, corner piece.

06:08.846 --> 06:09.804
There's only four of those.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.196
Come on, man, shut up.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.635
Hassina, don't let anyone
make you doubt yourself.

06:14.678 --> 06:17.159
You are brave
and smart and strong,

06:17.202 --> 06:20.075
and I promise one day
you will be a great doctor.

06:20.118 --> 06:23.339
[Gul Bashra speaking Pashto]

06:25.428 --> 06:27.343

I have to go. [speaks Dari]

06:27.387 --> 06:28.953
[speaks Dari]

06:28.997 --> 06:30.607
You must be proud of her.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.479
[exhales]
Ten years ago,

06:32.522 --> 06:34.872
she wouldn't have been allowed
to go past the first grade.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.048
I was so smart,
I skipped the first grade.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.441
You sure you didn't
skip all the grades?

06:38.485 --> 06:39.790
[laughter]

06:39.834 --> 06:41.966
Boy, your dad makes
great brownies.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.664
Those are mine?
You son of a...

06:43.707 --> 06:44.882
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.144
No, wait, you're
gonna squish 'em.

06:46.188 --> 06:48.103
RILEY:
Spit it out, spit it out.

06:59.984 --> 07:02.030
Have you guys been up all night?

07:02.073 --> 07:03.553
President Ghani is gone.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.120
Airport's been mobbed,

07:05.163 --> 07:07.339
commercial flights are canceled.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.341
We don't know when
they're gonna start up again.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.517
Or if.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.695
I should have gotten her out
a month ago.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.000
I should have had her go
to the airport

07:16.044 --> 07:17.393
as soon as Herat was gone.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.525
Maybe she could have gotten
on a flight.

07:18.568 --> 07:19.917
This is all my fault.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.832
Hey, no, it is not.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.486
I encouraged her
to get the U.N. job.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.661
I told her
she would be safe.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.836
If I hadn't done that,

07:25.880 --> 07:27.534
she would not be
a target right now.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.667
Look, I've never met Hassina,
but it sounds like this job was

07:30.711 --> 07:32.887
the most important thing
in her life.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.237
It was.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.674
I also never got the impression

07:37.718 --> 07:40.198
that she actually listens
to you.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.247
[snores]

07:46.074 --> 07:47.467
All right, what do we know?

07:47.510 --> 07:48.729
Good morning.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.731
Wow, that's the longest
I've gone

07:50.774 --> 07:52.559
without taking a leak in years.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.343
I got to sleep
out here more often.

[snorts]

08:07.878 --> 08:09.706
[sighs]

08:09.750 --> 08:11.578
Where'd you get that?

08:11.621 --> 08:13.144
Hazel invented it.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.494
Did she tell you that?

08:15.364 --> 08:17.453
It did seem a little beyond her.

08:17.497 --> 08:21.065
[ringtone playing]

08:21.109 --> 08:23.067
Hassina, what's going on?

08:23.111 --> 08:24.373
HASSINA: My boss called.
He got me on a list

08:24.416 --> 08:25.679
for the U.N. chartered plane.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.115
It's leaving tomorrow.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.552
Alhamdulillah.
That is great news.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.293
But how am I going
to get to the airport?

08:31.336 --> 08:32.990
There are Taliban checkpoints
on the road,

08:33.034 --> 08:34.426
and it's my only chance
to get out.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.037
Hassina, you can't look
like you're going there.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.429
Okay?
D-Don't take any luggage.

08:37.473 --> 08:38.822
Hide your documents
under your clothes.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.084
Have Zubair drive you.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.129
But then what?

08:41.172 --> 08:42.609
Have you seen the pictures?

08:42.652 --> 08:45.612
It's chaos. People are being
whipped and tear-gassed.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.265
Hassina, I know, I know.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.224
Our friend Todd is in touch
with the Marines at the airport.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.747
We are going to
call him right now.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.793
We will have a plan for
you when you get there.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.229
I'm so glad we know Todd.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.578
Pretty sure no one has
ever said that before.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.059
Hassina, let's go
through this again,

08:58.102 --> 09:00.540
and this time I want you
to write it all down.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.893
NEWSMAN: After getting control
of Afghanistan

09:05.936 --> 09:07.547
for the first time in 20 years,

09:07.590 --> 09:10.506
the Taliban may be facing
a financial crisis...

09:10.550 --> 09:11.768
Al.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.117
...as its access
to foreign currency reserves

09:13.161 --> 09:14.902
have been severed because...What?

09:14.945 --> 09:17.600
Just take a tiny break.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.080
You can still go
back to your phone,

Where is everybody?

20:09.425 --> 20:11.906
Asleep.
Oh.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.691
Want to see my roundhouse?

20:15.997 --> 20:18.826
No, you can't have my wallet!
[shouts]

20:21.437 --> 20:22.786
Very nice.

20:23.526 --> 20:26.094
Hassina is safe.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.444
How come you're not more happy?

20:29.576 --> 20:31.404
I am happy for my sister.

20:35.886 --> 20:39.194
I am heartbroken for my country.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.239
