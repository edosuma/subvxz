02:02.229 --> 02:04.394
Deflection is good.

02:04.396 --> 02:05.465
Off the post!

02:07.300 --> 02:10.168
Now out of the zone in
the center of the ice.

02:10.169 --> 02:11.301
Look out!

02:11.303 --> 02:12.872
Oo, just missed it.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.876
Dumps it off and
chases on the fly.

02:18.211 --> 02:21.111
Westridge now pouring
in off the bench.

02:21.113 --> 02:22.212
What a hit!

02:45.338 --> 02:47.504
What the hell, man?

02:47.506 --> 02:49.439
What are you doing out of bed?

02:49.441 --> 02:51.278
I can't go to sleep.

02:52.646 --> 02:54.646
Tell me a story.

02:54.648 --> 02:56.380
Tell you a story?

02:56.382 --> 02:57.917
A scary story.

02:58.652 --> 03:01.019
You want me to tell
you a scary story?

03:01.021 --> 03:02.253
Yep.

03:02.255 --> 03:04.021
I'm trying to watch the game.

03:04.023 --> 03:04.657
Please.

03:07.626 --> 03:10.662
Okay, you want a scary story?

03:10.664 --> 03:13.000
I'll tell you a scary story.

03:14.134 --> 03:17.001
He shoots, he scores!

03:17.003 --> 03:20.504
Let's see, ah,
I got one for you.

03:20.506 --> 03:24.609
Once upon a time there
was a guy named Johnny.

03:24.611 --> 03:28.111
You see, the thing you got
to know about Johnny is,

03:28.113 --> 03:30.681
Johnny is an asshole.

04:38.684 --> 04:41.151
What
the fuck is this?

04:41.153 --> 04:43.086
It is your lunch,
señor Johnny.

04:43.088 --> 04:45.358
No, you ignorant wetback.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.328
Is this metal?

04:51.131 --> 04:54.264
Sí, señor Johnny,
that is a metal spoon.

04:54.266 --> 04:57.769
How many times have I
said that I cannot eat

04:57.771 --> 05:00.071
with metal utensils?

05:00.073 --> 05:03.507
I follow a strict Edo
period macrobiotic diet

05:03.509 --> 05:05.278
which means no metal.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.512
I apologize señor Johnny,

05:08.514 --> 05:09.713
I can bring you a plastic...

05:09.715 --> 05:12.449
Plastic, are
you loca señorita?

05:12.451 --> 05:13.754
Wood, I need wood.

05:15.254 --> 05:18.158
I apologize
señor Johnny.

05:20.393 --> 05:22.192
It's okay.

05:22.194 --> 05:23.429
Now, come here.

05:30.102 --> 05:34.273
It's too late, you've already
tainted it with the metal.

05:35.408 --> 05:38.412
Forget it, I'll get
something later.

05:40.814 --> 05:42.049
No.

05:43.150 --> 05:46.283
Go get the hypoallergenic
cloth, then wipe it up.

05:46.285 --> 05:48.054
Sí, señor Johnny.

05:53.093 --> 05:55.793
Like two little piglets
wrestling under a blanket.

05:55.795 --> 05:57.595
How many kids do
you have, Lucia.

05:57.597 --> 05:59.863
Seis, señor Johnny.

05:59.865 --> 06:03.100
And that's why
you're not invited.

06:03.102 --> 06:06.739
Those things must just
fall out at this point.

06:14.413 --> 06:15.545
Stop!

06:15.547 --> 06:16.646
Stop!

06:16.648 --> 06:19.584
You freaking taco, what
do you think you're doing?

06:19.586 --> 06:21.586
Ah, sí, señor Johnny.

06:23.489 --> 06:25.790
What, what are you saying?

06:25.792 --> 06:27.124
Speak English.

06:27.126 --> 06:29.127
Ah, no hablo
ingles, señor Johnny.

06:29.129 --> 06:30.495
Hablo español,

06:30.497 --> 06:32.800
No salt, the salt you idiot.

06:34.234 --> 06:36.766
I said you only pour
salt in the pool

06:36.768 --> 06:39.237
with pink Himalayan sea salt.

06:39.239 --> 06:42.139
Ah, sí, señor Johnny, yeah.

06:42.141 --> 06:45.143
Abominable blazario.

06:45.145 --> 06:47.214
Oh my God, no, Himalayan.

06:48.648 --> 06:50.417
Alejandro, Alejandro!

06:51.316 --> 06:53.119
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.155
Yes, sir.

06:56.088 --> 06:59.225
Will you please
translate Jose for me?

07:00.893 --> 07:04.098
I don't speak
Spanish, Mr. Johnny.

07:05.331 --> 07:08.533
Your name is Alejandro, how
could you not speak Spanish?

07:08.535 --> 07:09.567
Sir, my actual name...

07:15.874 --> 07:18.209
Señor Johnny, you have
to forgive my husband.

07:18.211 --> 07:20.177
He's having mental problems,
you know he did not...

07:20.179 --> 07:21.415
What is that?

07:22.448 --> 07:24.882
The
micro-antibacterial rag.

07:24.884 --> 07:27.386
No, no, those are my boxers.

07:28.888 --> 07:30.655
Give me that.

07:30.657 --> 07:31.492
Aiesha!

07:36.328 --> 07:37.163
Aiesha!

07:40.699 --> 07:42.966
What the fuck, Aiesha?

07:42.968 --> 07:44.968
Seriously, how dumb are you?

07:44.970 --> 07:48.738
Why in the Philippians,
would you but my white boxers

07:48.740 --> 07:50.908
in with my brand new red sheets?

07:50.910 --> 07:54.780
Well, Mr. Johnny, if
you brought me that...

08:08.994 --> 08:10.860
Damn these bloody bitches.

08:10.862 --> 08:14.233
Why is it so hard
to get fucking laid.

08:17.737 --> 08:19.306
You, you can do it.

08:21.874 --> 08:24.374
I ain't sleeping
with you, Mr. Johnny.

08:24.376 --> 08:25.875
You wish.

08:25.877 --> 08:28.913
Now go get this chick and
drop her off where I tell you.

08:28.915 --> 08:30.781
I ain't a taxi service.

08:30.783 --> 08:33.884
Besides, you have one
of them pick her up.

08:33.885 --> 08:36.721
You're whatever Ben
Franklin says you are.

08:36.722 --> 08:38.923
Besides, those fence
fairies clown car

08:38.924 --> 08:43.229
probably smells like
refried beans and tampico.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.902
And if I don't?

08:50.303 --> 08:53.004
Then you're out of a job.

08:53.006 --> 08:54.572
Thank you, Mr. Johnny.

08:54.574 --> 08:57.910
It's been a real
pleasure working for you.

08:59.545 --> 09:01.615
Okay, what do you want?

09:04.317 --> 09:05.919
I want an invite.

09:08.288 --> 09:10.288
It's for hot girls only.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.289
Well, it looks like you're
going to be one hot girl short.

09:12.291 --> 09:13.960
Goodbye, Mr. Johnny.

09:16.596 --> 09:17.998
Okay, fine, wait.

09:21.034 --> 09:24.938
I'll text you the address
when I'm on the road.

09:33.512 --> 09:35.046
Hey, don't short change me

09:35.048 --> 09:37.514
on the weeding and
shit, Alejandro.

09:37.516 --> 09:39.517
Got my eye on you.

09:39.519 --> 09:42.919
Don't make me call immigration.

09:42.921 --> 09:44.721
Why isn't my shit loaded yet?

09:44.723 --> 09:47.627
I'll get right
on it, Mr. Johnny.

09:53.065 --> 09:56.933
Did he just threaten to
call immigration on y'all?

09:56.935 --> 10:00.339
He still thinks
we're fucking Mexicans.

10:01.506 --> 10:03.977
I mean, do we look
Mexican to you?

10:07.713 --> 10:11.682
You know damn well
I ain't no Mexican.

10:11.684 --> 10:12.850
I got to go guys.

10:12.852 --> 10:16.086
I got to run an
errand for Mr. Johnny.

11:09.007 --> 11:12.710
Jennifer, we need to
go get Brittany from the club.

11:12.712 --> 11:15.881
Who the
hell is Brittany.

11:25.925 --> 11:28.527
Hey, you friends of Johnny's?

11:30.029 --> 11:30.894
Get in.

11:30.896 --> 11:32.897
Woo, that's that
I'm talking about!

11:32.899 --> 11:34.565
Party time!

11:34.567 --> 11:35.402
Woo!

11:42.208 --> 11:44.207
Okay, remember now, Johnny
can't know that we're dating.

11:44.209 --> 11:46.009
Luke, we've been
dating for a year

11:46.011 --> 11:48.846
and I still haven't
met your brother.

11:48.848 --> 11:50.214
Yeah, but Johnny's
a big prick,

11:50.216 --> 11:53.918
I don't think you
want to meet him.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.220
Are you sure this
is going to be safe?

11:56.222 --> 11:58.556
Yeah, why would
it not be safe?

11:58.558 --> 12:02.396
What if he
tries to sleep with me?

12:04.130 --> 12:06.629
I don't think he's going to
be trying to sleep with you.

12:06.631 --> 12:08.097
How do you know that?

12:08.099 --> 12:10.701
Cause you're not his type,
he only likes fun girls.

13:15.535 --> 13:16.770
Motherfucker.

13:17.904 --> 13:19.739
He expects us to walk.

13:21.540 --> 13:22.175
Damn it.

13:41.794 --> 13:44.662
You know, it's really cool
that you don't have a radio.

13:44.664 --> 13:46.996
Gave us a chance
to talk, you know.

13:46.998 --> 13:48.298
Really get to know each other

13:48.300 --> 13:51.568
and connect on a
spiritual level.

13:51.570 --> 13:53.706
Hey, should I come with you?

13:54.973 --> 13:57.707
Totally feeling you, man.

13:57.709 --> 14:01.814
We should be quiet, take in
the nature that surrounds us.

14:32.612 --> 14:34.912
I think we have to walk.

14:39.651 --> 14:41.818
Yeah, it's just like you
could feel the ora of people,

14:41.820 --> 14:44.621
you know, it's like it
radiates off of them, you know.

14:44.623 --> 14:47.890
Like Brittany's ora is kind
of like dark, you know.

14:47.892 --> 14:51.828
Yours is like, like I can feel
that you feel me, you know.

14:51.830 --> 14:54.398
It's like that time Johnny
walked into the vape shop.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.767
Ah, like, I knew there
was something different.

14:56.769 --> 14:59.302
Just something about his ora.

14:59.304 --> 15:01.107
Do you hear the bells?

15:02.742 --> 15:03.376
Oh my God.

15:06.378 --> 15:09.712
This is so fucking cool, man.

15:18.424 --> 15:20.423
You two really
make a cute couple.

15:20.425 --> 15:22.359
Oh, we're not a couple.

15:22.361 --> 15:24.327
I'm just a random hot
girl he found on the street.

15:24.329 --> 15:26.062
Street?

15:26.064 --> 15:28.197
Oh my God, no, no you should
really try dancing instead.

15:28.199 --> 15:29.365
It's how Johnny and I meet.

15:29.367 --> 15:31.067
She's not a hooker.

15:31.069 --> 15:33.736
Oh, well either way, dancing
is amazing for the body.

15:33.738 --> 15:35.272
Like seriously, you
should see what it does...

15:35.274 --> 15:36.340
She's not going to
be a stripper either.

15:36.342 --> 15:38.174
I'm a CPA actually.

15:38.176 --> 15:41.080
So, you like to
watch people pee?

15:42.448 --> 15:44.181
I wonder why Aiesha's here?

15:44.183 --> 15:47.817
Oh my God, I am so glad
that they brought Aiesha

15:47.819 --> 15:49.887
I bet she's here
to do the laundry.

15:49.889 --> 15:52.155
I don't think this
place has running water.

15:52.157 --> 15:53.225
Wait, what?

16:05.036 --> 16:06.736
Where's Johnny?

16:06.738 --> 16:08.772
How the hell should I know?

17:53.479 --> 17:57.016
Welcome everybody,
please have a seat.

18:08.894 --> 18:11.961
Hear ye, hear ye, I
officially commence

18:11.963 --> 18:16.168
this years haunted hot girl
and one black bitch challenge.

18:18.270 --> 18:22.442
No, no, no, you see it's
okay, cause he's an asshole.

18:24.609 --> 18:25.976
What are you doing out of bed?

18:25.978 --> 18:27.877
Just getting some water.

18:27.879 --> 18:29.212
What's he doing out of bed?

18:29.214 --> 18:31.515
He couldn't sleep so
I'm telling him a story.

18:31.517 --> 18:34.151
How many beers has he had?

18:34.153 --> 18:35.152
Stolen
and clear to the center,

18:35.154 --> 18:36.021
down the ice.

18:37.857 --> 18:41.528
They're just hanging
on now with 2:36 to go.

18:44.430 --> 18:47.597
Up to the line gathering speed.

18:47.599 --> 18:50.634
That pass does not connect.

18:50.636 --> 18:54.471
His stories are
better when he's drunk.

18:54.473 --> 18:56.539
- Alright.
- Continue.

18:56.541 --> 18:58.911
So, anyway, where was I?

19:00.078 --> 19:01.580
Mm, yeah I got it.

19:03.616 --> 19:04.481
Alright, haunted hot girl...

19:04.483 --> 19:07.886
Girl and one black
bitch challenge.

19:09.454 --> 19:11.421
The rules are simple.

19:11.423 --> 19:14.223
You spin the gun and
wherever it lands

19:14.225 --> 19:16.425
is where you stay for the night.

19:16.427 --> 19:19.264
If you leave,
you're disqualified.

19:20.232 --> 19:22.566
If you give up, you must yell,

19:22.568 --> 19:27.336
"Johnny has the biggest
cock I've ever seen."

19:27.338 --> 19:29.071
That's it.

19:29.073 --> 19:32.608
You wish, my petite
Nubian house servant.

19:32.610 --> 19:35.679
No, I like to change
the odds up every year

19:35.681 --> 19:38.382
and this one is no exception.

19:38.384 --> 19:41.451
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you,

19:41.453 --> 19:42.888
the Devil's Acid.

19:45.223 --> 19:48.392
Oh hell no, I
ain't doing no drugs.

19:48.394 --> 19:50.626
Well then there's the door.

19:50.628 --> 19:52.564
No acid, no competir.

19:53.598 --> 19:56.098
Those are the rules, comprende?

20:03.375 --> 20:05.545
Well, show me the money.

20:16.555 --> 20:18.622
That's what I thought.

20:18.624 --> 20:20.193
Now, one more rule.

20:22.126 --> 20:24.297
Cell phones in the basket.

20:42.748 --> 20:46.920
I have placed battery
operated cameras everywhere.

20:48.354 --> 20:51.691
So, I will know if
you attempt to cheat.

20:55.994 --> 20:57.463
Is that dad's gun?

20:58.463 --> 21:00.630
Yeah, ass wipe, it is.

21:00.632 --> 21:04.567
He left it to me, just like
he left everything else.

21:04.569 --> 21:08.005
Wait a second, how
did you get this place?

21:08.007 --> 21:09.642
Airbnb, now shut up!

21:13.311 --> 21:14.577
It's on the internet.

21:14.579 --> 21:17.748
Now we'll go from a scale of
hotness so Delilah you're up.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.482
What, Johnny?

21:19.484 --> 21:20.319
What?

21:24.356 --> 21:26.789
Oo, the prison chapel.

21:26.791 --> 21:29.759
It's time for you to
find God, Delilah.

21:29.761 --> 21:32.729
Maybe if you're lucky,
I'll help you look for him.

21:35.800 --> 21:36.636
Open wide.

21:43.809 --> 21:45.011
Excuse me.

21:47.445 --> 21:49.378
Hi, I'm so sorry, could you
just move her right along

21:49.380 --> 21:53.051
so we can move onto the
next hottest please.

22:17.209 --> 22:19.342
Okay, so onto
the next hottest.

22:19.344 --> 22:20.179
Let's see.

22:28.553 --> 22:31.320
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

22:31.322 --> 22:33.025
She's new, okay.

22:34.693 --> 22:35.694
She's new.

22:37.096 --> 22:39.531
Well played little brother.

22:41.099 --> 22:43.799
You didn't think I'd
figure it out did you?

22:43.801 --> 22:45.469
What?

22:45.471 --> 22:49.239
You knew I wouldn't plow
her because she's a stuck up,

22:49.241 --> 22:52.744
tight wound bitch with
a stick up her ass.

22:53.811 --> 22:56.278
- Yeah.
- I'm proud of you.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.548
For once little brother.

22:58.550 --> 23:00.819
Why don't you do the honors.

23:03.688 --> 23:04.855
Spin it?

23:04.857 --> 23:06.123
Oh.

23:06.125 --> 23:06.759
Um.

23:11.864 --> 23:13.529
Whoa.

23:13.531 --> 23:15.798
That's the scariest place
in the whole prison.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.836
Boo!

23:21.740 --> 23:22.742
And for you.

23:31.817 --> 23:32.652
Well go.

23:35.319 --> 23:36.489
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:39.925 --> 23:42.528
And Luke, after you take her.

23:43.828 --> 23:45.561
Be sure to come back right away.

23:45.563 --> 23:47.631
I need you for some
insurance polices.

23:47.633 --> 23:49.900
Yeah, but if the acid is
as strong as you say it is,

23:49.902 --> 23:51.101
how are we going to...

23:51.103 --> 23:55.141
Just shut your pie hole and
get back here mucho fasto.

24:02.446 --> 24:06.618
Now it's your turn my little
trailer park princess.

24:14.626 --> 24:17.394
Oo, that place
has a lot of beds.

24:17.396 --> 24:21.964
So, am I supposed to be
like Goldilocks or something?

24:21.966 --> 24:24.169
No, it's so we can...

24:25.904 --> 24:28.273
You know what, never mind.

24:30.908 --> 24:32.277
Now open wide.

24:33.811 --> 24:37.315
Won't be the last time
I say that tonight.

24:39.651 --> 24:42.321
So, what do I do with my bags.

24:45.557 --> 24:46.893
What the hell?

24:48.226 --> 24:49.960
What did you plan on going?

24:49.962 --> 24:51.661
I told you to pack
like you were camping.

24:51.663 --> 24:53.363
I really thought that
you would have an RV.

24:53.365 --> 24:55.298
You know, not the small
one like my papaw lives in

24:55.300 --> 24:57.433
you know, that sits on blocks
and doesn't go anywhere,

24:57.435 --> 24:58.801
but like, you know,
one like Blake Shelton

24:58.803 --> 25:00.569
might go on tour in.

25:00.571 --> 25:01.406
Yeah.

25:05.010 --> 25:06.375
Nevermind.

25:06.377 --> 25:08.444
You go ahead and have some fun.

25:08.446 --> 25:11.617
Dr. Johnny will check
up on you later.

25:12.783 --> 25:16.354
Wait, I thought that
you went to law school.

25:34.272 --> 25:38.243
And of course I save the
least hottest for last.

25:40.011 --> 25:42.447
Time to drop a little acid.

25:44.582 --> 25:46.819
Now spin and take your hit.

25:53.492 --> 25:56.058
Give me the
fucking bag of money.

25:56.060 --> 25:59.962
Right now and I'll let
your sorry ass live.

25:59.964 --> 26:02.501
They're like suites, okay.

26:03.969 --> 26:05.567
Everything's fine Brittany.

26:05.569 --> 26:07.272
Everything's fine.

26:10.742 --> 26:14.411
At least we have
electricity, that's good.

26:14.413 --> 26:17.282
Oh, patient rooms, oxygen, okay.

26:20.452 --> 26:21.953
My room, okay, no.

26:23.088 --> 26:26.892
Oh, that's nice, clean,
let nothing behind.

26:29.493 --> 26:30.328
Okay.

26:31.762 --> 26:35.667
It's for like a special
meeting room or something.

26:38.770 --> 26:42.540
You dumb bitch.

26:44.975 --> 26:46.311
It ain't loaded.

26:51.683 --> 26:53.083
See.

26:53.085 --> 26:54.151
It's just like your
grandmother's house, you know,

26:54.153 --> 26:55.518
the boogieman isn't real,
it's all in your head.

26:57.121 --> 26:57.956
Oh, Bambi.

26:59.523 --> 27:00.592
I'm so sorry.

27:09.501 --> 27:10.836
Shit, oh shit.

27:18.976 --> 27:20.576
I swear to God I'm
going to stop eating meat.

27:20.578 --> 27:22.112
God, yes, Jesus, right.

27:22.114 --> 27:24.547
If you pray to the Lord you
won't get abducted by ghosts,

27:24.549 --> 27:25.781
it makes sense.

27:25.783 --> 27:27.951
Okay, you hear that ghosts?

27:27.953 --> 27:30.386
You can't get me because
I believe in God.

27:30.388 --> 27:32.388
Jesus died for me.

27:32.390 --> 27:33.425
Okay.

27:34.626 --> 27:36.792
Oh my God, okay.

27:36.794 --> 27:40.963
Oh, okay, everything's fine,
it's not creepy at all.

27:40.965 --> 27:42.499
See, he's just messing
with you Brittany,

27:42.501 --> 27:43.732
that's all it is... Oh my God,

27:43.734 --> 27:46.502
he gave you the
one with the spa.

27:46.504 --> 27:48.003
That sweet boy.

27:48.005 --> 27:50.606
See, he's not all bad, you're
fine Brittany, you're fine.

28:18.569 --> 28:23.071
So, what did
he mean insurance policies?

28:23.073 --> 28:26.608
Oh, he just means like
pranks and stuff like that.

28:26.610 --> 28:28.111
Does he scare us?

28:28.113 --> 28:32.816
Yeah, it's just masks
and props and lights and,

28:32.818 --> 28:35.451
it's kind of like
a haunted house.

28:42.159 --> 28:42.994
Luke.

28:45.496 --> 28:47.165
Luke, hey, you okay?

28:48.066 --> 28:48.700
Yeah.

28:50.034 --> 28:51.166
Yeah, that acid's kicking in.

28:51.168 --> 28:53.138
We need to go to our room.

29:00.212 --> 29:03.779
I think this is
the safest place.

29:03.781 --> 29:06.516
Johnny said this is the
scariest place in the prison.

29:06.518 --> 29:09.088
Yeah, but it's
the most secure.

29:12.223 --> 29:15.491
You're not going to try to
scare me or freak me out right?

29:15.493 --> 29:18.763
No, I was actually
thinking we could.

29:26.238 --> 29:28.171
Have you ever made
love on acid on before?

29:28.173 --> 29:29.008
No.

29:30.142 --> 29:34.611
I think we should try to
start this trip out right.

29:35.981 --> 29:37.982
- Fuck Luke.
- Goddammit.

29:39.216 --> 29:41.183
Why the fuck did
you do that Luke?

29:41.185 --> 29:42.751
That wasn't me, I swear.

29:42.753 --> 29:44.520
God, you just
said you help him

29:44.522 --> 29:46.858
with his insurance policies.

29:48.260 --> 29:49.192
Yeah, but I think he
does that to fuck with me

29:49.194 --> 29:51.260
just as much as he
does to fuck with you.

29:51.262 --> 29:53.796
Okay, alright,
you know what Luke?

29:53.798 --> 29:54.931
This is what you're going to do.

29:54.933 --> 29:56.066
You're going to go out there

29:56.068 --> 29:57.634
and you're going to help
your brother scare the shit

29:57.636 --> 29:59.903
out of those other
girls so they lose.

29:59.905 --> 30:03.105
But what if he comes and
scares you when I'm gone?

30:03.107 --> 30:06.009
Then you stay on his ass
til those other girls are gone

30:06.011 --> 30:10.279
and you get him so
fucked up he passes out.

30:10.281 --> 30:11.483
Then what?

30:13.117 --> 30:17.490
Then we come back here, maybe
I'll make a man out of you.

30:20.692 --> 30:22.027
- Um, fuck.
- Go.

30:40.845 --> 30:42.681
It's not bad at all.

30:45.684 --> 30:47.317
You can do this Brittany.

30:47.319 --> 30:49.251
Just like that time you
stayed at that Hilton.

30:49.253 --> 30:52.721
You know, you just never
speak about it again.

30:52.723 --> 30:55.624
That's real, that's real.

30:55.626 --> 30:58.196
That's real, everything's okay.

31:00.632 --> 31:02.332
You know what, it's okay.

31:02.334 --> 31:06.669
Everything's fine, I'm
fine, this is fine.

31:06.671 --> 31:07.306
Okay.

31:08.706 --> 31:11.676
Where's Aiesha
when you need her?

31:19.184 --> 31:20.085
Okay, okay.

31:23.855 --> 31:24.757
Okay, okay.

31:25.991 --> 31:28.223
Okay, that's good.

31:28.225 --> 31:28.859
Okay.

31:31.663 --> 31:34.730
Not what I signed up for but.

31:34.732 --> 31:36.365
I mean, I really thought they
would have a valet service.

31:36.367 --> 31:38.334
Thank God, fresh sheets.

31:38.336 --> 31:39.868
You think of
everything Brittany.

31:39.870 --> 31:42.974
See, people don't
think you're smart.

31:44.274 --> 31:46.174
I knew I forgot instructions.

31:46.176 --> 31:48.243
Okay, how does Aiesha do it.

31:48.245 --> 31:49.080
It's like,

31:51.683 --> 31:53.383
you know, this is
when you need Aiesha.

31:53.385 --> 31:55.218
All she had to do was just
come with me and do the sheets.

31:55.220 --> 31:58.954
I don't really think
that's too much to ask.

31:58.956 --> 32:01.824
That's not right, we'll
come back to that, okay.

32:01.826 --> 32:02.661
It's fine.

32:06.665 --> 32:09.399
Oh my God, I forgot about you.

32:09.401 --> 32:12.669
Oh my gosh, oh happy day.

32:12.671 --> 32:13.869
I'm going to name you Fredrick.

32:13.871 --> 32:16.207
Where am I going to put you?

32:17.142 --> 32:17.977
Okay.

32:19.444 --> 32:20.346
Convenient.

32:22.446 --> 32:23.648
You're real.

32:25.783 --> 32:29.352
It smells like somebody died,
but you won't, you won't.

32:29.354 --> 32:32.355
Okay Fredrick, you sit there.

32:32.357 --> 32:35.692
Okay, you can be my only
friend tonight Fredrick.

32:35.694 --> 32:37.261
Oh my God, you match!

32:38.262 --> 32:39.729
We didn't even plan it.

32:39.731 --> 32:42.397
Oh my God, it's like
we were meant to be.

32:42.399 --> 32:46.771
Seriously Fredrick, nobody
understands me the way you do.

32:48.373 --> 32:50.173
Do you love it?

32:50.175 --> 32:51.307
I know, thank you.

32:51.309 --> 32:54.143
Thank you so much, I do
think it brings out my eyes.

32:54.145 --> 32:55.411
You are so sweet.

32:55.413 --> 32:56.445
He's not even going
to be mad that

32:56.447 --> 32:59.082
I bought them on
his Planex card.

32:59.084 --> 32:59.885
Okay.

33:06.223 --> 33:10.727
Ah yeah, she was wearing
this black lace outfit

33:10.729 --> 33:12.929
and these tight little jeans

33:12.931 --> 33:16.265
and just started to
shimmy right out of them.

33:16.267 --> 33:17.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:17.402 --> 33:18.934
No one wants to see that.

33:18.936 --> 33:20.470
What happened to Aiesha?

33:20.472 --> 33:23.005
Oh yeah, Aiesha, yeah, yeah.

33:23.007 --> 33:24.240
I was getting to that,
I was getting to that.

33:24.242 --> 33:25.173
It's cool, it's cool.

33:25.175 --> 33:26.843
Alright, so check it out.

33:26.845 --> 33:30.480
Johnny was knocked slapped
the fuck out, right

33:30.482 --> 33:34.784
and he's in this naughty dream
with this disgusting shit,

33:34.786 --> 33:35.884
whatever the fuck
Johnny dreams of.

34:23.065 --> 34:24.068
Luke!
Luke!

34:25.569 --> 34:26.804
Luke!

34:28.138 --> 34:30.373
Where are you man, come on!

34:38.014 --> 34:38.815
Luke!

34:43.254 --> 34:44.520
Luke!

34:44.522 --> 34:47.389
Where are you, you pussy?

35:02.874 --> 35:06.845
Johnny, looks like you're in
a bit of a pickle, my friend.

35:08.213 --> 35:11.450
What you need is a
spiritual awakening.

35:12.550 --> 35:14.852
Won't you come over here.

35:15.919 --> 35:17.421
Take this iowaska.

35:20.158 --> 35:22.261
Go bone that hippy chick.

35:23.394 --> 35:25.995
Stop worrying about
that dead girl.

35:25.997 --> 35:28.897
She ain't going anywhere.

35:28.899 --> 35:30.334
Go have some fun.

35:34.339 --> 35:36.408
Thanks, iowaska shaman.

36:13.611 --> 36:14.743
Hey.

36:14.745 --> 36:18.950
Oh my God, you came, I
didn't think you could make it.

36:19.684 --> 36:22.553
How could I ever let you down?

36:23.955 --> 36:26.592
Look what he did,
isn't this amazing?

36:28.225 --> 36:31.863
Ah, Delilah, you always
see the best in people.

36:35.499 --> 36:38.936
I think you need to
look a little closer.

36:50.180 --> 36:53.918
Oh, Delilah, are you
ready to find God yet?

36:58.222 --> 36:59.455
I don't want him to see me.

36:59.457 --> 37:00.359
No, wait.

37:04.328 --> 37:05.930
Hey, flower girl.

37:07.064 --> 37:09.665
Have you found your
lord and savior?

37:15.205 --> 37:17.541
He's right in front of me.

37:21.546 --> 37:24.015
You ever hear of iowaska?

37:25.649 --> 37:28.084
This'll make you
see the universe.

37:28.086 --> 37:28.921
Oh yeah.

37:30.187 --> 37:31.022
Wait.

37:33.992 --> 37:37.296
I have a secret I've
never told you about.

37:38.528 --> 37:41.699
Oh, wait, you're
not a dude are you?

37:44.702 --> 37:46.736
Is that a problem?

37:46.738 --> 37:48.636
Just kidding, silly.

37:52.010 --> 37:54.743
- Someone's here with me.
- Oo.

37:54.745 --> 37:58.082
And she's just like
me only naughtier.

38:00.318 --> 38:02.720
You mean like a naughty twin?

38:04.022 --> 38:06.756
You want me to bring her out?

38:06.758 --> 38:09.225
I'm scared but yeah baby.

38:09.227 --> 38:11.560
Bring that naughty twin out.

38:11.562 --> 38:13.428
She's starts
shaking her ass

38:13.430 --> 38:17.566
and crawling real slow
underneath the table.

38:17.568 --> 38:19.267
All of a sudden.

38:19.269 --> 38:22.974
So, why is she
crawling under the table?

38:24.075 --> 38:26.207
It's for dramatic
effect, moron.

38:26.209 --> 38:28.213
You need another beer.

38:38.555 --> 38:41.092
This is the best ass ever.

38:43.528 --> 38:48.064
So, the basic conceptualization
of the Copenhagen theory

38:48.066 --> 38:53.069
is that all particles exist
of waves of probability.

38:53.071 --> 38:54.037
Yes.

38:54.039 --> 38:57.408
Now, apply that theory
to larger articles.

38:59.142 --> 38:59.774
Oh.

39:14.825 --> 39:15.659
Check.

39:25.368 --> 39:29.540
Come on, cowboy, how about
a little role in the hay?

39:32.810 --> 39:35.647
Don't mind if I
do, little lady.

39:36.814 --> 39:38.817
Don't forget about me.

39:45.622 --> 39:47.723
Do you know, you kind of look
like Jenny's groundskeeper.

39:47.725 --> 39:50.593
I mean, he's kind of cute
but he's a groundskeeper.

39:50.595 --> 39:53.194
I mean, I would never.

39:53.196 --> 39:56.397
I did let him watch me
sunbathe though once.

39:56.399 --> 40:00.238
So, tell me, how much
do professors make, hmm?

40:01.805 --> 40:03.307
Jennifer.

40:06.209 --> 40:09.347
Come here, I want to
show you something.

42:05.028 --> 42:05.863
Johnny?

42:33.823 --> 42:36.325
What's your malfunction
little brother?

42:36.327 --> 42:40.361
Why are you interrupting
something so beautiful?

42:40.363 --> 42:41.462
You told me to come
back and help you

42:41.464 --> 42:43.968
when I was done with Jennifer.

42:45.368 --> 42:48.240
Oh, yeah, right.
How's that going?

42:50.006 --> 42:51.406
It's alright.

42:51.408 --> 42:53.475
Hey, I found everyone
except for Aiesha.

42:53.477 --> 42:55.410
Do you know where she's at?

42:55.412 --> 42:56.747
Oh, yeah, right.

42:58.649 --> 42:59.848
Don't move.

42:59.850 --> 43:03.785
When I come back, I'll
help you find God.

43:03.787 --> 43:04.622
Come on.

43:08.459 --> 43:11.794
Luke, there's something
I got to show you.

43:11.796 --> 43:13.495
But you can't lose your shit.

43:13.497 --> 43:16.368
Can't you just tell me?

43:19.769 --> 43:21.939
I got to show it to you.

43:25.975 --> 43:29.345
And by the way,
clean yourself up.

43:29.347 --> 43:31.649
You look like a Chinese whore.

43:34.385 --> 43:35.720
Johnny?
Johnny.

43:44.961 --> 43:46.928
What the poop dick?

43:46.930 --> 43:49.464
She was just right here.

43:49.466 --> 43:51.899
Who Johnny, what happened?

43:51.901 --> 43:53.435
Aiesha.

43:53.437 --> 43:55.006
I fucking shot her.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.841
Are you sure?

43:58.843 --> 44:02.814
Yes, I'm fucking sure,
look at all this blood.

44:05.115 --> 44:08.819
Johnny, maybe she
crawled off somewhere.

44:10.388 --> 44:11.754
Let's go find her.

44:11.756 --> 44:13.758
We have to finish her.

44:16.127 --> 44:16.961
What?

44:18.162 --> 44:19.564
Think about it.

44:20.798 --> 44:24.133
Two white dudes
trespassing in a prison

44:24.135 --> 44:26.000
with a bunch of
acid tripping chicks

44:26.002 --> 44:28.837
and the one that dies
is the black one.

44:28.839 --> 44:29.671
Yeah.

44:29.673 --> 44:31.807
We'll get the chair.

44:31.809 --> 44:34.410
This isn't 1950s
Alabama anymore, Luke.

44:34.412 --> 44:35.647
It's not, fuck.

44:39.182 --> 44:41.685
What do you mean, trespassing?

44:43.120 --> 44:45.390
I broke in here stupid.

44:47.024 --> 44:51.192
I thought you said this
was an Airbnb, Johnny?

44:51.194 --> 44:54.399
Yeah, Luke, got
it through Airbnb.

44:57.100 --> 45:00.435
Either way, we have to find
her and we have to find her now

45:00.437 --> 45:03.774
before someone finds
her in the morning.

45:08.511 --> 45:09.147
Shit.

45:12.216 --> 45:14.015
I don't see the gun.

45:14.017 --> 45:16.017
Johnny, I don't see the
fucking gun either man.

45:17.187 --> 45:19.390
Oh, shit, it's Jennifer.

45:20.057 --> 45:21.689
Don't you even think about it.

45:21.691 --> 45:24.192
You help your brother.

45:24.194 --> 45:26.430
Bro, I'm out, bro.

45:28.499 --> 45:30.834
If I go down, you go down.

45:32.202 --> 45:35.169
Find this walking problem.

45:35.171 --> 45:36.140
Oh yeah, no.

45:56.260 --> 45:57.462
Professor?

45:58.562 --> 45:59.164
Professor?

46:01.598 --> 46:02.434
Professor?

46:05.870 --> 46:07.569
Who the hell are you?

46:07.571 --> 46:09.604
Stranger danger, somebody help!

46:09.606 --> 46:11.573
You know exactly
who I am, Brittany.

46:11.575 --> 46:13.609
No, I have no
idea who you are.

46:13.611 --> 46:14.977
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.

46:14.979 --> 46:16.211
Cause I know you.

46:16.213 --> 46:18.013
I've seen you rummaging
around Johnny's house

46:18.015 --> 46:20.781
looking for a safe when you
thought no one was watching.

46:20.783 --> 46:23.819
How the fuck did you
...Okay, you know what,

46:23.821 --> 46:25.254
I was doing that because
I just needed to...

46:25.256 --> 46:29.223
I know exactly
what you were doing.

46:29.225 --> 46:31.759
Which is why I made damn sure
all of you were here tonight

46:31.761 --> 46:34.129
to atone for your sins.

46:34.131 --> 46:38.834
That's why I made sure Johnny
got those little party favors.

46:38.836 --> 46:41.203
Oh my God, it was you, you're
the devil, it was your acid.

46:48.044 --> 46:51.013
Enjoy the rest of
your night Britt brat.

46:51.015 --> 46:52.750
Or what's left of it.

48:08.258 --> 48:09.093
Aiesha?

48:12.095 --> 48:12.930
Aiesha?

48:15.633 --> 48:18.569
Where are you my
sneaky succubus?

48:26.377 --> 48:28.377
Oh my God, oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God, oh my God.

48:28.379 --> 48:30.345
He didn't see us, he didn't
see us, he didn't see us

48:30.347 --> 48:31.245
and it's fine Brittany,

48:31.247 --> 48:32.814
you're fine, you're
fine, you're fine.

48:32.816 --> 48:35.017
Brittany, what's
wrong with you?

48:35.019 --> 48:38.419
Oh, the devil, the devil,
the devil, he was chasing me.

48:38.421 --> 48:40.087
What?

48:40.089 --> 48:41.323
The devil, the devil,
the one on the acid pack,

48:41.325 --> 48:42.256
he came to me and
he told me that

48:42.258 --> 48:44.660
I'm going to pay for my sins.

48:44.662 --> 48:45.660
Maybe it was the acid.

48:45.662 --> 48:50.365
No, no listen, this
was real, he was real.

48:50.367 --> 48:52.636
Brittany, listen to me.

48:53.736 --> 48:56.671
All you have to do is say,

48:56.673 --> 48:59.707
"Johnny's got the biggest
cock I've ever seen."

48:59.709 --> 49:01.209
I can make this all go away.

49:01.211 --> 49:03.712
I am not quitting
Johnny, fuck you

49:03.714 --> 49:04.580
and where have you been, huh?

49:04.582 --> 49:06.848
You been out there
screwing Delilah?

49:06.850 --> 49:09.417
Screwing with her baby, you
know I don't like to lose.

49:09.419 --> 49:11.986
You know what, I'm
not quitting, okay.

49:11.988 --> 49:13.721
So, if you need me,

49:13.723 --> 49:14.790
I am going to be standing
right here in this corner

49:14.792 --> 49:18.160
having the greatest
psychedelic experience ever.

49:18.162 --> 49:19.861
Did you know that
the word psychedelic

49:19.863 --> 49:23.265
derives from the Greek word
meaning mind or feeling?

49:23.267 --> 49:25.834
Yep, the professor
taught me that.

49:25.836 --> 49:27.803
Although now I don't
know, I don't know.

49:27.805 --> 49:29.705
I think the devil might
have him under some kind of

49:29.707 --> 49:32.140
mind control or something.

49:33.977 --> 49:35.213
He's my friend.

49:38.848 --> 49:40.415
You haven't seen
Aiesha have you?

49:40.417 --> 49:41.348
What the maid?

49:41.350 --> 49:42.783
No!

49:42.785 --> 49:43.984
But you know what if
I had I would tell you

49:43.986 --> 49:45.386
because you know what, that
bitch would be disqualified

49:45.388 --> 49:47.089
because she's out
of her area right?

49:47.091 --> 49:49.091
What did she spin?

49:49.093 --> 49:50.792
Uh.

49:50.794 --> 49:54.395
Forgot I rigged that.

49:54.397 --> 49:57.734
I need to go check
on Luke's yoga pants.

49:59.068 --> 50:01.403
Okay, it's fine,
you're fine, you're fine.

50:01.405 --> 50:03.471
Oh God, there you are professor.

50:03.473 --> 50:04.441
I was worried.

50:36.506 --> 50:40.877
I can't
wait to wear you skin.

51:07.870 --> 51:09.339
Over here.

52:10.367 --> 52:12.399
Jennifer, Jennifer.

52:12.401 --> 52:14.169
Jennifer, Jennifer.

52:14.171 --> 52:15.006
Jennifer.

52:16.006 --> 52:17.439
How am I supposed to win

52:17.441 --> 52:20.207
if you sit her
cowering like an idiot.

52:24.948 --> 52:26.951
Step outside Jennifer.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.889
I know who you are.

52:33.656 --> 52:36.957
You're not going to fool me.

52:36.959 --> 52:40.263
Wait, who are the
people with the devil?

52:41.231 --> 52:43.301
Seriously, you are like

52:44.468 --> 52:48.403
the worst fucking
story listener ever.

52:48.405 --> 52:51.205
You don't need to know every
little detail as it happens.

52:51.207 --> 52:55.378
Pay attention, it's called
a set up okay, shut up.

52:56.914 --> 52:58.647
Alright, where was I.

52:58.649 --> 53:00.348
Oh, yeah, yeah.

53:00.350 --> 53:01.185
The devil.

53:02.653 --> 53:04.888
You want me to lose.

53:06.656 --> 53:10.658
I bet you Johnny paid you to
come here and mess with us.

53:10.660 --> 53:14.995
He's probably the one that put
your face on the acid, right?

53:14.997 --> 53:19.533
You all think this is
Johnny's game but it's not.

53:19.535 --> 53:21.669
This is my game.

53:30.046 --> 53:32.413
Not very smart Jennifer.

53:32.415 --> 53:34.683
This is an abandoned prison.

53:34.685 --> 53:38.456
I don't think anyone
has keys to this cell.

53:40.691 --> 53:43.024
Yeah, but you know what?

53:43.026 --> 53:44.993
That means I can't leave.

53:44.995 --> 53:46.998
Which means we win, huh?

53:47.964 --> 53:48.999
We?

53:49.999 --> 53:51.001
Interesting.

53:52.169 --> 53:54.939
You and Luke are
in this together.

53:56.707 --> 53:58.943
Have a good night Jennifer.

54:12.455 --> 54:14.024
Oh, señor Johnny?

54:15.658 --> 54:16.961
Señor Johnny?

54:19.095 --> 54:21.031
Wake up, señor Johnny

54:22.732 --> 54:24.334
Oh, señor Johnny?

54:26.102 --> 54:27.171
Señor Johnny?

54:29.539 --> 54:31.374
Wake up, señor Johnny.

54:32.776 --> 54:33.611
Lucia?

54:38.048 --> 54:40.080
Señor Johnny, you don't
have time for a nap,

54:40.082 --> 54:41.448
you have to wake up.

54:41.450 --> 54:43.051
You have work to do.

54:43.053 --> 54:44.388
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

54:45.589 --> 54:48.592
You have to go find
Aiesha and bury her.

54:50.160 --> 54:52.359
You're right.

54:52.361 --> 54:55.298
Oh, señor Johnny,
one more thing.

54:56.399 --> 54:59.002
Here's your fucking
wooden spoon.

55:05.542 --> 55:07.979
Fuck yes, there is a God.

55:38.274 --> 55:39.276
Luke!
Luke!

55:40.609 --> 55:42.676
Wake the fuck up.

55:42.678 --> 55:44.212
What the fuck is wrong with you?

55:44.214 --> 55:46.150
Wake up, you pussy.

55:47.117 --> 55:48.319
I need your help.

55:51.821 --> 55:54.057
Johnny, the devil's here.

55:55.225 --> 55:57.125
What the hell are
you talking about?

55:57.127 --> 56:00.694
The devil from
the acid, he's here.

56:00.696 --> 56:02.863
It's the acid, stupid.

56:02.865 --> 56:05.600
Now get up, I found Aiesha.

56:05.602 --> 56:08.169
Oh, great, where is she?

56:08.171 --> 56:08.806
Dead.

56:10.173 --> 56:12.240
Now, I need you to
go get the shovel,

56:12.242 --> 56:15.479
meet me back here,
we have to bury her.

56:39.435 --> 56:41.636
Why do you let your brother
treat you that way, Luke?

56:41.638 --> 56:42.473
Fuck.

56:45.307 --> 56:48.343
Uh, this isn't happening,
you're not real, right?

56:48.345 --> 56:49.810
Touch me, Luke.

56:49.812 --> 56:50.912
- Fuck.
- Touch me.

56:50.914 --> 56:51.912
- Fuck.
- Touch me, Luke.

56:51.914 --> 56:53.548
I'm not touching you.

56:53.550 --> 56:54.781
I'm not touching you.

56:54.783 --> 56:55.716
I'm not touching you.

56:55.718 --> 56:56.551
Fuck, I'm not touching you.

56:56.553 --> 56:57.821
- Do it.
- Fuck!

57:29.952 --> 57:33.187
Johnny, what are you doing man?

57:33.189 --> 57:35.790
What does it look
like I'm doing?

57:35.792 --> 57:37.691
It looks like
you're playing golf.

57:37.693 --> 57:40.861
Where's Aiesha, we don't
have time for this.

57:40.863 --> 57:43.330
Shit, you're right.

57:43.332 --> 57:45.232
I have to go disqualify
those two twats

57:45.234 --> 57:47.868
before I get Rick Ross.

57:47.870 --> 57:49.303
Start digging.

57:49.305 --> 57:50.437
Johnny.

57:50.439 --> 57:52.207
Johnny, we fucked up bad man.

57:52.209 --> 57:53.941
The devil's here and he's
going to fucking kill us.

57:53.943 --> 57:56.343
Will you shut up
about that devil shit.

57:56.345 --> 57:58.245
The devil is not real.

57:58.247 --> 58:00.448
He's a fucking dealer
mark on a fucking acid.

58:00.450 --> 58:01.519
Nothing more.

58:03.620 --> 58:07.488
Now I'm going and try to
screw Delilah one more time,

58:07.490 --> 58:09.823
get her disqualified.

58:09.825 --> 58:12.426
Then I'm going to bang
Brittany, get her disqualified

58:12.428 --> 58:15.729
and then I'm going to bring
Aiesha's body back here

58:15.731 --> 58:19.533
and if that is not taken care
of by the time I get back,

58:19.535 --> 58:21.935
I'm going to triple
dip Jennifer.

58:21.937 --> 58:26.473
So, if you want first
crack at it get that done

58:26.475 --> 58:31.245
or I'm going to go Gulliver's
Travels on your ass.

58:31.247 --> 58:31.881
Alright.

58:34.818 --> 58:39.020
You got something to
say to me littler brother.

58:39.022 --> 58:39.857
No.

58:43.026 --> 58:45.229
That's what I thought.

59:32.676 --> 59:34.311
- Delilah?
- Yeah?

59:38.347 --> 59:41.551
Do you want to feel
the ultimate power?

59:42.752 --> 59:43.821
Whoa, yeah.

59:47.691 --> 59:51.861
To gain something, you
must sacrifice something.

59:53.396 --> 59:55.698
What do I have to sacrifice?

59:59.803 --> 01:00:01.405
Your innocence.

01:00:09.379 --> 01:00:12.683
That's part of who
I am, that's my soul.

01:00:17.086 --> 01:00:20.623
Don't you want to
be powerful like me?

01:00:34.136 --> 01:00:37.504
Oh Delilah,
your king has returned.

01:00:37.506 --> 01:00:39.140
Hey, Johnny.

01:00:39.142 --> 01:00:40.640
Come over here and
let Delilah show you

01:00:40.642 --> 01:00:42.713
what you've been missing.

01:00:50.452 --> 01:00:54.087
Johnny has the
biggest cock I've ever seen.

01:00:54.089 --> 01:00:56.691
- You hear that?
- Mm-mm.

01:00:56.693 --> 01:00:58.428
They're calling me.

01:01:00.497 --> 01:01:02.964
Don't you see, I won?

01:01:02.966 --> 01:01:05.799
All I have to do is
disqualify those two chicks

01:01:05.801 --> 01:01:07.134
and then I'm going to
come back and take care of

01:01:07.136 --> 01:01:09.506
you in more ways than one.

01:01:10.839 --> 01:01:13.174
This'll be the easiest year yet.

01:01:13.176 --> 01:01:15.412
Praise be the devil's acid.

01:01:16.146 --> 01:01:18.812
Praise be the devil's acid.

01:01:18.814 --> 01:01:21.182
Praise be the devil's acid.

01:01:21.184 --> 01:01:23.183
Praise be the devil's acid.

01:01:24.486 --> 01:01:25.852
Praise be the devil's acid.

01:01:25.854 --> 01:01:28.423
Praise be the devil's acid.

01:01:28.425 --> 01:01:30.693
Praise be the devil's acid.

01:01:42.138 --> 01:01:46.510
It is time for us to
sacrifice your innocence.

01:02:44.501 --> 01:02:45.535
No, no.

01:03:39.856 --> 01:03:43.256
Three
down, oh what a save!

01:03:43.258 --> 01:03:45.325
Cleared but not out.

01:03:45.327 --> 01:03:46.861
Another shot blocked.

01:03:46.863 --> 01:03:50.064
I think you might want
to lighten this up a bit?

01:03:50.066 --> 01:03:53.133
Mask out.

01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:57.270
Stolen and clear to the
center down the ice.

01:03:57.272 --> 01:03:59.073
There's just hanging
on now with 2:3...

01:03:59.075 --> 01:04:00.611
Right, right, um.

01:04:01.644 --> 01:04:02.279
Luke.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.845
Oh, Luke, that's right.

01:04:05.847 --> 01:04:08.915
Luke was about to get the
fuck out of dodge, right.

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:11.285
He was going to get Jessica
and go get the money

01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:13.821
and just get the hell out
of there, fuck this shit.

01:04:13.823 --> 01:04:15.288
But he's tripping his balls off.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:18.692
He's high as a
motherfucking kite, right.

01:04:18.694 --> 01:04:21.662
He runs in the dining
room to get the money,

01:04:21.664 --> 01:04:25.669
but there's a little
problem once he gets there.

01:04:28.037 --> 01:04:31.942
Ah, god dog it, what
the fuck's this, no way.

01:04:35.377 --> 01:04:36.613
Oh, no.

01:04:46.155 --> 01:04:47.654
I've got plenty of girls left

01:04:47.656 --> 01:04:50.057
and you're not going to stop me.

01:04:54.229 --> 01:04:56.666
You weighed like an elephant.

01:04:57.399 --> 01:04:59.970
Stop eating all that chicken.

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:12.982
Why won't you
make love to me, Johnny?

01:05:15.151 --> 01:05:17.752
It's because you're black.

01:05:17.754 --> 01:05:20.220
I don't pork black chicks.

01:05:20.222 --> 01:05:23.357
We're all pink
on the inside, Johnny.

01:05:23.359 --> 01:05:24.194
Are you?

01:05:25.761 --> 01:05:27.631
I've never seen one.

01:05:28.765 --> 01:05:32.035
I guess I was just
afraid of the truth.

01:05:39.374 --> 01:05:41.110
Go on, take a peek.

01:05:43.713 --> 01:05:45.881
I'm dead and I won't mind.

01:05:51.687 --> 01:05:53.624
Yeah, yeah you are.

01:06:17.946 --> 01:06:18.781
Boys!

01:06:20.216 --> 01:06:22.750
Now, Mr, Fonzworth, I have
told you a million times

01:06:22.752 --> 01:06:24.819
you cannot speak to me that way.

01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:28.992
I am a respectable nurse and
you're too disrespectable.

01:06:31.026 --> 01:06:33.493
Now, Mr. Hank, you cannot
put that in the back door

01:06:33.495 --> 01:06:35.162
for that extra 20.

01:06:35.164 --> 01:06:39.399
But I will let you put that
finger someplace really special

01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:42.470
for that, but you
have to be gentle.

01:07:00.756 --> 01:07:01.791
Babe.

01:07:02.492 --> 01:07:04.794
How did you get in there?

01:07:06.328 --> 01:07:07.763
Is there a key?

01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:10.531
Do you have keys?

01:07:10.533 --> 01:07:13.303
I'm going to get you some keys.

01:07:35.357 --> 01:07:39.729
I'm going to go get the
keys and I'll be back, okay.

01:07:46.202 --> 01:07:47.468
Johnny.

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.305
Johnny

01:07:49.372 --> 01:07:50.941
What the fuck, man?

01:07:53.176 --> 01:07:54.575
I know.

01:07:54.577 --> 01:07:57.877
I know what this looks like.

01:07:57.879 --> 01:07:58.814
I can explain.

01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:02.582
Johnny, this is
unexplainable, man.

01:08:02.584 --> 01:08:06.352
Where are the keys,
Jennifer's locked in her cell?

01:08:06.354 --> 01:08:08.955
You're right, brother.

01:08:08.957 --> 01:08:10.991
I have the keys.

01:08:10.993 --> 01:08:14.028
I have the keys to her heart.

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:17.997
Less burning repentance,
purify lonesome candles.

01:08:17.999 --> 01:08:20.099
I'm sorry, Aiesha.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.904
We're not meant to be together.

01:08:23.839 --> 01:08:25.305
Focus man, where are the keys?

01:08:25.307 --> 01:08:26.941
Jennifer's locked in her
cell, I need to get her out.

01:08:26.943 --> 01:08:29.345
I am focused, little brother.

01:08:30.511 --> 01:08:33.112
You need enlightenment.

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:35.452
The force is with you, Luke.

01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:53.634
Hey, Johnny.

01:08:53.636 --> 01:08:56.573
Or should I call
you, Mr. Johnny?

01:09:01.977 --> 01:09:02.812
Delilah?

01:09:04.946 --> 01:09:06.948
Is this your new friend?

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:09.852
Are you cheating?

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:15.858
You know, since you left,
you're technically disqualified.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.568
What the fuzz?

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:29.402
I'm not into that shit.

01:09:29.404 --> 01:09:32.104
Funny, your browser
history says otherwise.

01:09:32.107 --> 01:09:36.376
Man, look, I don't even
know why I'm talking to you.

01:09:36.377 --> 01:09:37.978
This shit isn't real.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:40.482
Johnny, now the game begins.

01:09:42.685 --> 01:09:46.522
The game began a couple
hours ago ass clown.

01:09:50.959 --> 01:09:54.361
Alright,
alright, alright.

01:09:54.363 --> 01:09:57.130
What you going to do now, Luke?

01:09:57.132 --> 01:09:59.700
I have to find keys
and let Jennifer out.

01:09:59.702 --> 01:10:01.602
Yeah, man.

01:10:01.604 --> 01:10:04.170
That's exactly
what you got to do.

01:10:04.172 --> 01:10:05.639
But you going to
need some money.

01:10:05.641 --> 01:10:08.509
Maybe we can sell the
dildos and make some money.

01:10:08.511 --> 01:10:12.011
Yeah, man,
that's a good idea.

01:10:12.013 --> 01:10:16.483
See, you're not as dumb as
people make you out to be.

01:10:16.485 --> 01:10:18.154
I'm a good person.

01:10:19.689 --> 01:10:21.956
Nice taxidermy.

01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:23.691
Thanks, man.

01:10:23.693 --> 01:10:25.358
What the fuck?

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.594
Why don't you just go away?

01:10:27.596 --> 01:10:29.295
You boys want to play a game,

01:10:29.297 --> 01:10:31.197
so that's what we're playing.

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:35.268
I'm just here to make sure
everything's on the up and up.

01:10:41.744 --> 01:10:43.609
You're just a hallucination.

01:10:43.611 --> 01:10:46.546
I'm tripping my balls
off, that's all.

01:10:46.548 --> 01:10:50.617
I really don't want
to hurt you, Luke.

01:10:50.619 --> 01:10:52.185
You seem nice enough and
I don't think you meant

01:10:52.187 --> 01:10:54.356
to cause anybody any harm.

01:10:55.591 --> 01:10:59.026
But you're involved with
some really bad people.

01:10:59.028 --> 01:11:03.162
Against my better judgment,
I'm trying to let you off,

01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:05.001
if you just leave now.

01:11:09.771 --> 01:11:11.941
Fine, suit yourself, Luke.

01:11:16.044 --> 01:11:19.179
By the way, one of
your charges got loose.

01:11:19.181 --> 01:11:21.048
They don't look too happy.

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.685
Fuck!

01:11:26.288 --> 01:11:29.459
Oh, Delilah, your
king has returned.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:52.914
Shit!

01:11:54.749 --> 01:11:56.750
Stand up
for yourself, Luke.

01:11:56.752 --> 01:11:57.584
What?

01:11:57.586 --> 01:12:01.287
Go on
man, you can do it?

01:12:01.289 --> 01:12:04.425
You heard me, stand
up for yourself.

01:12:04.427 --> 01:12:07.161
You can take her, go on.

01:12:07.163 --> 01:12:09.499
Yeah, you're right, I can.

01:12:12.767 --> 01:12:14.600
Fuck, Delilah!

01:12:14.602 --> 01:12:15.803
Shit, I'm sorry.

01:12:15.805 --> 01:12:17.140
What the fuck?

01:12:23.546 --> 01:12:24.446
Oh, fuck.

01:12:27.348 --> 01:12:30.117
That a boy,
Luke, you did it.

01:12:30.119 --> 01:12:31.852
I'm proud of you boy.

01:12:31.854 --> 01:12:36.025
Now, go and find Jennifer
before Johnny fucks her.

01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:52.242
Open B112.

01:13:01.449 --> 01:13:02.883
Damnest thing,

01:13:02.885 --> 01:13:06.319
they left these laying up
there in the control center.

01:13:06.321 --> 01:13:09.223
There are guard uniforms
laying everywhere.

01:13:09.225 --> 01:13:12.562
They just walked off
and left the place.

01:13:13.762 --> 01:13:16.266
I'm ready, padre.

01:13:17.665 --> 01:13:19.867
I think it's time for you
to join the festivities.

01:13:19.869 --> 01:13:21.438
Dead man walking.

01:13:52.868 --> 01:13:54.934
I'm sorry, Luke.

01:13:54.936 --> 01:13:56.672
I'm sorry I used you.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.210
I should've told you
I used to fuck Johnny.

01:14:03.212 --> 01:14:04.911
I was just trying to get even

01:14:04.913 --> 01:14:07.380
and I was using you to do that.

01:14:13.454 --> 01:14:17.526
I was going to take the
money and move to Mexico.

01:14:18.827 --> 01:14:22.132
But now they're
giving me the needle.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.169
Did you say you fucked Johnny?

01:14:31.472 --> 01:14:32.307
Yeah.

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:36.245
And I'll tell you something.

01:14:39.315 --> 01:14:43.216
He really does have the
biggest cock I've ever seen.

01:14:43.218 --> 01:14:44.785
You're a pussy, Luke.

01:14:44.787 --> 01:14:47.353
You always have been
and you always will be.

01:14:47.355 --> 01:14:48.190
Sweetie.

01:14:49.592 --> 01:14:50.226
Babe.

01:14:51.593 --> 01:14:54.694
I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:14:54.696 --> 01:14:57.997
How does my fucking
pussy feel now?

01:14:57.999 --> 01:15:01.337
Ewe, gross, so,
Jennifer fucked Johnny?

01:15:02.404 --> 01:15:04.574
No, try to keep up okay.

01:15:06.007 --> 01:15:07.441
This is Luke's acid trip.

01:15:07.443 --> 01:15:09.776
He's fucking tripping
his balls off, alright.

01:15:09.778 --> 01:15:11.377
It's not what she's
actually saying.

01:15:11.379 --> 01:15:12.645
Oh.

01:15:12.647 --> 01:15:14.880
And watch your
fucking language.

01:15:14.882 --> 01:15:15.948
Push!

01:15:17.352 --> 01:15:18.286
Yeah, come on, it's
the biggest shit

01:15:18.288 --> 01:15:20.786
you've ever taken in
your life, come on.

01:15:21.856 --> 01:15:22.688
Push!

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.424
There, there it is!

01:15:30.031 --> 01:15:33.332
Hi, mommy, I think
it's time to breastfeed.

01:15:44.279 --> 01:15:46.345
Mommy, I love you.

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:50.317
I brought you a teddy bear.

01:15:52.887 --> 01:15:54.321
Johnny has the
biggest cock I've ever seen!

01:15:54.323 --> 01:15:55.389
Johnny has the biggest
cock I've ever seen!

01:15:55.391 --> 01:15:56.023
Professor!

01:15:56.025 --> 01:15:57.260
Anybody?

01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.329
Fuck!

01:16:02.498 --> 01:16:04.697
Mommy.

01:16:04.699 --> 01:16:06.032
The door's locked!

01:16:06.034 --> 01:16:07.733
I'm coming for you.

01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:11.337
Johnny, you're so
big, I swear to God.

01:16:11.339 --> 01:16:13.072
Oh my God, no engagement
ring is worth this.

01:16:13.074 --> 01:16:14.008
I hate him, I hate him.

01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:15.742
Oh my God, I should've
seen this coming.

01:16:44.038 --> 01:16:45.706
You know what
would be really cool?

01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:48.841
If the twins grabbed
her out of the cabinet,

01:16:48.843 --> 01:16:53.045
made out with her and
then sliced her throat.

01:16:53.047 --> 01:16:56.116
It's fine, it's
fine, shh, shh.

01:16:56.118 --> 01:16:59.388
Why does it smell
like fucking vomit?

01:17:00.788 --> 01:17:01.623
Oh my God.

01:17:15.404 --> 01:17:19.939
You could have at least
waited til I kissed her.

01:17:19.941 --> 01:17:21.610
It's not too late.

01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:23.812
Fuck it.

01:17:25.547 --> 01:17:26.382
What?

01:17:27.548 --> 01:17:30.649
No, that can't,
there's no twins.

01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:33.652
The twinS at the
demon baby birth.

01:17:33.654 --> 01:17:35.121
It's a split personality.

01:17:35.123 --> 01:17:36.023
Don't you get it?

01:17:36.025 --> 01:17:38.392
The sacrifice? It
was all in her head?

01:17:38.394 --> 01:17:40.059
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:17:40.061 --> 01:17:41.995
I like the twins idea.

01:17:41.997 --> 01:17:44.965
What, no.

01:17:44.967 --> 01:17:48.468

brother's asleep.

01:21:23.051 --> 01:21:25.818
Well, so, Luke bashes Johnny's
head with a golf club,

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.188
everyone lives happily
ever after, the end.

01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:30.090
Now go to bed.

01:21:30.092 --> 01:21:33.359
What, no, that can't be
the ending, that sucks.

01:21:33.361 --> 01:21:34.861
So what if...

01:21:55.316 --> 01:21:59.685
Hey bro, we should
probably get out of here.

01:21:59.687 --> 01:22:02.255
Delilah's gone crazy.

01:22:02.257 --> 01:22:04.260
And I murdered Jennifer.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.661
Something's wrong
with Brittany too.

01:22:08.663 --> 01:22:10.663
I'll say something's wrong.

01:22:10.665 --> 01:22:12.732
She has no fucking head.

01:22:12.734 --> 01:22:13.903
Oh, goddamn.

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:17.606
Poor girl.

01:22:20.441 --> 01:22:22.274
Did you do that?

01:22:22.276 --> 01:22:25.144
No, I only killed Jennifer.

01:22:25.146 --> 01:22:25.981
What?

01:22:29.418 --> 01:22:31.687
Because you fucked her.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.155
What?

01:22:43.164 --> 01:22:46.836
Man, you seriously
cannot handle your drugs.

01:22:56.177 --> 01:22:56.811
Jennifer.

01:23:00.716 --> 01:23:02.952
Oo, then the twins show up.

01:23:13.494 --> 01:23:15.997
And they all start making out.

01:23:17.732 --> 01:23:19.365
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking...

01:23:19.367 --> 01:23:21.102
There are no twins.

01:23:23.003 --> 01:23:25.304
I really want
there to be twins.

01:23:25.306 --> 01:23:27.809
What if the twins kill Johnny?

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.782
There's no fucking twins!

01:23:35.784 --> 01:23:38.921
Oo, what if Aiesha's
brother shows up?

01:23:40.788 --> 01:23:42.855
Oh, son, they
need to calm down.

01:23:42.857 --> 01:23:44.491
Things are getting a little
too out of control over here.

01:23:44.493 --> 01:23:46.826
Come to avenge your sister?

01:23:46.828 --> 01:23:47.993
What?

01:23:47.995 --> 01:23:48.995
No.

01:23:48.997 --> 01:23:50.964
Just spit-balling here.

01:23:50.966 --> 01:23:53.532
Listen to the story.

01:23:53.534 --> 01:23:55.704
Okay, wait, where were we.

01:24:02.511 --> 01:24:05.310
See the groundskeeper
comes down from the tower.

01:24:05.312 --> 01:24:07.147
- Which was fucking stupid.
- Calm down man.

01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:08.014
What are you doing?

01:24:08.016 --> 01:24:09.819
What are you doing?

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.055
Here's Johnny.

01:24:16.391 --> 01:24:19.826
Oh, this is where
the devils sidekicks show up.

01:24:19.828 --> 01:24:21.960
Oh, shit, I almost
forgot, you're right, the setup.

01:24:26.133 --> 01:24:29.469
- What the unholy hell?
- Oh my God.

01:24:48.323 --> 01:24:50.322
I knew
Aiesha was the devil.

01:24:50.324 --> 01:24:54.928
Oh, look at you,
fucking genius, now shut up.

01:24:54.930 --> 01:24:57.596
What the fuck just happened?

01:24:57.598 --> 01:24:59.499
Did you put real
bullets in that?

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:00.666
You think I'm going to walk
around here wearing a mask

01:25:00.668 --> 01:25:03.836
scaring a bunch of white
folk without some protection.

01:25:03.838 --> 01:25:06.371
Man, that's shame about Dale.

01:25:06.373 --> 01:25:08.140
Why'd he have to leave
the guard tower anyway?

01:25:08.142 --> 01:25:08.974
This fool would
have been lights out

01:25:08.976 --> 01:25:10.979
in another five minutes.

01:25:14.449 --> 01:25:15.284
Damn.

01:25:18.587 --> 01:25:22.154
Oh, once a hippy,
always a hippy.

01:25:22.156 --> 01:25:25.258
That stupid motherfucker.

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.262
Well, come on, let's go.

01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:29.328
You get the money
from Johnny's safe?

01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:30.429
Easy peasy.

01:25:30.431 --> 01:25:32.165
- And the code?
- What else?

01:25:32.167 --> 01:25:34.102
- 696969.
- Predictable.

01:25:46.314 --> 01:25:50.282
Wait, what was the
point of the story?

01:25:50.284 --> 01:25:51.917
Isn't it obvious?

01:25:51.919 --> 01:25:53.152
Don't be an asshole?

01:25:53.154 --> 01:25:54.924
No, don't do drugs.

01:25:56.257 --> 01:25:57.091
Go to bed.

01:26:12.973 --> 01:26:14.109
Coming me amour.

01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:10.563
Hello?

01:27:10.565 --> 01:27:11.730
Hello?

01:27:11.732 --> 01:27:13.068
Is anyone there?

01:27:14.168 --> 01:27:15.003
Did I win?

01:27:24.611 --> 01:27:28.016
You want to be the
husband or the wife?

01:27:32.988 --> 01:27:33.955
The husband.

01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:39.759
Good, now get down and
suck your wife's dick?

01:27:39.761 --> 01:27:40.995
Oh, man.

01:27:43.765 --> 01:27:44.600
Oh, okay.
