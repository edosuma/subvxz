WEBVTT

00:07.362 --> 00:10.316
I don't know. The Betsey Johnson
dress might be a bit too much for work.

00:10.490 --> 00:13.278
That's what a new wardrobe's
all about, pushing the limits.

00:13.452 --> 00:17.995
Yeah, and stretching the budget.
Maybe I should just check with Piper.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.492
Oh, my God, Prue...

00:25.965 --> 00:27.424
I'm so embarrassed.

00:27.591 --> 00:29.631
Of course, she might have
other things on her mind,

00:29.802 --> 00:32.091
like having her way
with the handyman.

00:32.305 --> 00:34.381
- I thought you guys were shopping.
- Obviously.

00:34.557 --> 00:37.309
Oh, look, front-clasp bra.
She means business.

00:37.477 --> 00:39.304
- Serious business.
- Do you mind?

00:39.479 --> 00:43.180
No, are you kidding? I think it's great,
as long as he's not still on the clock.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.642
You guys have to get out of here
before he unfreezes.

00:45.819 --> 00:48.025
I never know how long this thing lasts.

00:48.238 --> 00:49.898
- How much did you guys spend?
- Lots.

00:50.073 --> 00:52.280
Prue's new look is perfect
for an SHW.

00:52.451 --> 00:54.444
- SHW?
- Single hot witch.

00:55.162 --> 00:58.365
Prue, are you sure this isn't depression
buying? You know, post-breakup?

00:58.541 --> 01:01.744
Does this look like something
a depressed woman would wear?

01:02.753 --> 01:04.663
- Maybe you should borrow it.
- Okay, time's up.

01:05.089 --> 01:08.256
You two gotta go. Go on.
Go in there and be quiet.

01:08.426 --> 01:10.050
We will if you will.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.203 --> 01:36.242
Kit, what is it?

01:37.832 --> 01:41.699
You forgot to unpack your briefcase
when you got home from work.

01:42.378 --> 01:44.869
And you want to do it right now.

01:50.053 --> 01:52.508
What you're about to pick up
is a tiara,

01:52.680 --> 01:55.635
but you really believe
it's your date book.

01:58.937 --> 02:01.345
Now put it in the desk,
just like you always do.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.106
Excellent.

02:07.321 --> 02:10.939
Now you want to continue
getting ready for bed.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.428
Well?

02:37.602 --> 02:40.687
Prue did exactly as I told her to.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.647
You know, I rather like
this new power.

02:43.984 --> 02:46.902
- And are you sure she didn't see you?
- No, no, she couldn't see me.

02:47.071 --> 02:52.029
- No, I was invisible.
- But then, how did you get there?

02:52.660 --> 02:55.365
I've explained this to you, Hannah.

02:55.538 --> 03:00.034
It's called astral projection. With it,
I can transport myself psychically

03:00.251 --> 03:03.585
and implant a subliminal thought
into Prue's brain.

03:03.755 --> 03:08.216
Just like I did when I tricked her into
leaving the vault today with the tiara.

03:08.635 --> 03:12.929
See, I planted the thought that made
her think she came out empty-handed.

03:13.140 --> 03:15.381
I still don't understand how it works.

03:15.684 --> 03:17.344
Watch.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.945
You want to disrobe for him.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.732
Desperately.

03:41.211 --> 03:43.702
Understand now, Hannah?

05:38.500 --> 05:41.038
If you ran an employment agency,
wouldn't you want me?

05:41.211 --> 05:43.702
Maybe, but I'd definitely
want my suit back.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.419
No, this is part of your old wardrobe.
I'm just recycling.

05:46.592 --> 05:50.969
- Well, the environment thanks you...
- But take it off. Yeah, I know, I know.

05:51.138 --> 05:52.798
Hi. Bye.

05:52.973 --> 05:55.761
Piper, didn't you have to go in
early this morning?

05:55.935 --> 05:58.508
Right, that was the plan.
I'm running a little late.

05:58.688 --> 06:02.271
It just took a little longer to get
out of bed this morning than I planned.

06:02.483 --> 06:04.025
Okay, bye.

06:04.193 --> 06:06.898
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

06:07.071 --> 06:08.649
You, Leo, last night. Dish.

06:09.115 --> 06:12.033
Well, it was nice. It was...
Well, it was wonderful.

06:13.036 --> 06:14.863
We just had a few problems.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.455
- Problems?
- What problems?

06:16.623 --> 06:19.624
Well, it's been a while
since, you know, I...

06:19.793 --> 06:23.838
And I was a little nervous,
and I kind of kept freezing him.

06:25.048 --> 06:29.343
- Piper, you didn't.
- I didn't mean to the first time.

06:29.970 --> 06:35.890
Okay, so at what point in the process
exactly did you freeze him?

06:37.353 --> 06:39.678
- Hello.
- I gotta go.

06:39.897 --> 06:43.267
- No, no, Piper, we're only teasing you.
- Yeah, truth is we're just jealous.

06:43.443 --> 06:45.981
Yeah, we're just happy to see you
with a great guy finally.

06:46.279 --> 06:48.948
I mean, between you and Leo,
and Prue, the new, hot Wicca woman,

06:49.115 --> 06:52.069
and me, soon to be employed,
things are looking up.

06:52.244 --> 06:54.153
Don't say that. The moment
somebody says that,

06:54.329 --> 06:57.781
- everything always goes south.
- Unless you freeze him.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.414
I couldn't help it. It was so good.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.286
Okay, okay, okay, come on.
If you're gonna borrow the car, let's go.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.715
- Good morning.
- Yeah, we heard.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.216
- Bye.
- Yeah, have a magical day.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.011
- What does she mean by that?
- Who knows.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.554
I'm late for work. Bye.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.072
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.712
Jaime, hey, what's going on?
What happened?

07:45.883 --> 07:48.920
- We got robbed last night, Prue.
- You're kidding. What was stolen?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.806
- The Romanov tiara.
- Oh, my God, not the tiara.

07:51.973 --> 07:55.093
- Prue.
- Rex, hi. Jaime just told me.

07:55.268 --> 07:58.055
- Yeah. Hello, nice to see you again.
- Hi, Rex.

07:58.229 --> 08:01.064
- I'm sorry about what happened.
- Yeah, me too.

08:01.232 --> 08:05.277
I mean, a loss of this magnitude
could severely damage our reputation.

08:05.445 --> 08:07.105
Who is gonna consign anything
with us...?

08:07.280 --> 08:10.780
No, no, no, we just have to get
the tiara back before word gets out.

08:11.368 --> 08:14.784
I agree. Will you take point on this
then? You know, help the police?

08:15.164 --> 08:17.287
You're really the only one
that I can trust.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.287
Sure, but what about you?

08:20.085 --> 08:22.707
Yeah, unfortunately, I've got
another commitment tonight

08:22.880 --> 08:23.995
that I can't get out of.

08:24.215 --> 08:26.338
It's some good friends
who are giving a concert,

08:26.509 --> 08:28.715
and, well, I promised
I wouldn't miss it.

08:28.886 --> 08:30.630
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- The Verve.

08:31.389 --> 08:34.176
- Get out! Are you serious?
- You know them?

08:34.392 --> 08:36.432
Know them? I worship them.
"Bittersweet Symphony"

08:36.602 --> 08:39.140
- is, like, the best song ever.
- Really?

08:40.273 --> 08:42.313
I have an idea.
Why not join me tonight.

08:42.525 --> 08:44.518
Yeah, I'm sure I can rustle up
another ticket.

08:46.989 --> 08:49.480
Well, you wouldn't mind,
would you, Prue?

08:50.534 --> 08:53.701
- Of course not. Why would I mind?
- Then it's a date.

08:53.912 --> 08:56.154
Well, figuratively speaking, of course.

08:56.373 --> 08:58.449
- Of course.
- Yeah.

08:58.626 --> 09:02.326
- Pick you up at 7, all right?
- Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks.

09:02.546 --> 09:04.753
Oh, look at the time.
I gotta get going.

09:04.924 --> 09:08.210
Hey, I promise I'll have
the car back by noon.

09:08.428 --> 09:10.171
Thanks for pitching in, Prue.

09:14.059 --> 09:16.728
- Prue.
- Andy.

09:17.062 --> 09:18.971
- Are you on this case?
- Yep.

09:19.147 --> 09:20.807
I guess fate keeps
throwing us together.

09:22.651 --> 09:26.234
- You two know each other. I forgot.
- No, you didn't.

09:26.446 --> 09:29.282
Well, I suggested that the inspector
speak with you

09:29.450 --> 09:32.866
since you were the last one
to actually see the tiara.

09:34.872 --> 09:37.659
If you need anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

09:38.084 --> 09:40.539
We'd like to see the security tapes
as soon as possible.

09:40.711 --> 09:42.371
Oh, yeah, I'm sure Prue
can arrange that.

09:43.881 --> 09:45.210
Excuse me.

09:48.678 --> 09:50.754
- How are you?
- Okay.

09:52.140 --> 09:55.805
It'd be better if you stopped by the
station so we could talk about all this.

09:55.977 --> 09:58.266
- One o'clock?
- Sure.

10:02.609 --> 10:05.231
I can't believe you're taking
that little witch to the concert.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.480
Rex, that was my ticket.

10:07.656 --> 10:10.064
Hannah, kitten.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.616
You know I'm only doing it
to upset Prue.

10:13.788 --> 10:18.580
All the better to frame her and force
the sisters to relinquish their powers.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.040
How do you know they even can?

10:21.212 --> 10:25.127
<i>There is a special spell
in The Book of Shadows.</i>

10:25.300 --> 10:27.969
When the time comes, they'll use it.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.719
Trust me.

10:34.392 --> 10:38.058
You put the tiara in the vault before
you left. Was anybody else there?

10:38.230 --> 10:40.519
The security guard, Jaime.

10:40.691 --> 10:42.482
Did he lock up the vault?

10:42.651 --> 10:44.644
No, I did.

10:44.820 --> 10:48.604
Okay, did you happen to take anything
out of the vault when you left?

10:48.783 --> 10:52.615
No. Is this an interview
or an interrogation?

10:53.079 --> 10:55.486
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to get all the facts, that's all.

10:55.665 --> 10:59.164
There were no signs of forced entry
into the auction house or the vault.

10:59.335 --> 11:02.621
So do you think that one of
the employees might have stolen it?

11:02.839 --> 11:04.832
- Strong possibility.
- Someone like me?

11:05.050 --> 11:07.089
No, don't be ridiculous.

11:07.260 --> 11:10.464
Still, we have to check out everyone's
story. Grand larceny's bigtime.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.590
Could cost a person
15, 20 years easily.

11:13.475 --> 11:16.559
We've got enough for now. We have
any questions, we'll give you a call.

11:16.728 --> 11:18.935
Well, you know where to reach me.

11:20.149 --> 11:21.607
I think I still remember.

11:24.278 --> 11:26.152
- What was all that about?
- You tell me.

11:26.322 --> 11:29.276
Last time you were ready to bust her.
Now you think she's Miss Innocent?

11:29.450 --> 11:32.535
That was a whole different situation,
completely unrelated.

11:32.703 --> 11:34.661
Look, I'm not saying
she did it, all right?

11:34.831 --> 11:37.915
But you have to admit a lot of the
arrows are pointing in her direction.

11:38.084 --> 11:40.836
It's also this. The security tapes
that Prue brought over?

11:41.212 --> 11:44.546
One's missing.
The one from the vault.

11:56.770 --> 11:58.430
You're glowing.

11:59.064 --> 12:01.187
Your face, total afterglow.

12:01.484 --> 12:04.153
It is not. It's just warm in here.

12:06.447 --> 12:08.321
So how much
was that tiara worth anyway?

12:08.491 --> 12:11.741
Well, I didn't get a chance to have it
appraised. We just got it in yesterday.

12:11.911 --> 12:15.161
But I would say well over
a million dollars.

12:15.331 --> 12:18.914
- Did they have any idea who stole it?
- Yeah, me.

12:19.836 --> 12:22.043
So, what's on the dessert menu?

12:22.214 --> 12:25.417
- Hey, how was the concert?
- The best. It was amazing.

12:26.176 --> 12:27.587
Still recycling, I see.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.089
Thanks for taking care of things
tonight, Prue. I really appreciate it.

12:32.266 --> 12:34.258
Don't you just love that accent?

12:35.227 --> 12:37.552
By the way,
how'd it go with the police?

12:38.606 --> 12:40.848
Oh, well, they think
it's an inside job, actually.

12:41.025 --> 12:43.433
Do they? How disturbing.

12:44.111 --> 12:47.196
Okay, shoptalk later.
We're gonna grab a table, okay?

12:47.365 --> 12:50.034
Take that one by the window.
I'll send Cindy over.

12:50.535 --> 12:53.951
- You're welcome to join us, Prue.
- No, thanks, I think I'll pass.

12:58.919 --> 13:01.077
- She's a big girl, Prue.
- Meaning?

13:01.254 --> 13:04.789
He's rich, he's stable, he's handsome.
We should be happy for her.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.124
- I'm thrilled.
- Are you jealous?

13:08.720 --> 13:11.675
No. No.

13:11.849 --> 13:13.224
More like territorial.

13:13.684 --> 13:15.641
Okay, I would just like
to keep my work world

13:15.811 --> 13:17.638
separate from my home world.
Is that okay?

13:18.773 --> 13:20.231
Good luck.

13:32.329 --> 13:34.286
Good morning.

13:34.456 --> 13:37.741
- Wow, roses. Who are they for?
- Guess.

13:38.543 --> 13:40.916
Leo, I need to call you back.
Something's about to come up.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.330
I'll see you later, okay? Bye.

13:43.507 --> 13:48.003
"Phoebe, thank you for a lovely
evening. The job is on its way. Rex."

13:48.387 --> 13:51.803
Oh, what a sweetheart.
Wait, who opened the box?

13:53.684 --> 13:57.018
I can't get over how beautiful
these are. Can you, Prue?

13:57.188 --> 14:00.522
So it must have been quite a night,
you know, after the concert.

14:00.817 --> 14:02.774
I'll put these in some water.

14:02.944 --> 14:06.313
All I did was tell Rex that I was
going to the employment agency.

14:06.489 --> 14:09.027
He said he'd make a few calls
and help me out.

14:09.242 --> 14:10.653
So, what's the big problem?

14:11.244 --> 14:14.863
Phoebe, really,
it's none of my business.

14:15.707 --> 14:17.664
It's just... Watch what you say
to him, okay?

14:17.834 --> 14:21.369
Because there are certain things I
don't want my boss to know about me.

14:26.719 --> 14:29.589
Andy, what are you doing here?

14:29.764 --> 14:33.346
We're here to search your house
for the tiara, Prue.

14:33.517 --> 14:35.510
We've got a search warrant.

14:49.993 --> 14:53.409
Wait, how can you guys even think
that Prue stole the tiara?

14:53.580 --> 14:54.991
We don't, Phoebe. Not necessarily.

14:55.165 --> 14:57.122
Then what are you doing here,
spring cleaning?

14:57.292 --> 14:59.415
Any idea where the vault
security camera tape is?

14:59.628 --> 15:02.463
- I gave you the tapes.
- Not that one.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.251
It wasn't there, Prue.

15:08.095 --> 15:09.922
Why did you do that?

15:11.390 --> 15:12.885
That's why.

15:13.643 --> 15:16.264
No, no, no, wait. That is not possible.
How did it get there?

15:16.771 --> 15:19.642
I don't know. You better come up
with an answer before they unfreeze.

15:19.816 --> 15:22.521
- Someone must've planted it.
- Somebody's been in our house?

15:23.069 --> 15:26.273
It doesn't matter. Just let them find it.
I have nothing to hide. I'm innocent.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.989
That doesn't look very innocent.
Piper, hide it.

15:38.377 --> 15:40.619
You think you should check
under the pillows.

15:40.796 --> 15:42.623
Morris, check under the pillows.

15:49.597 --> 15:51.305
How did he know to look there?

15:51.974 --> 15:54.466
Put it in the dresser.
He's already looked there.

15:59.899 --> 16:02.984
You want to look
in the dresser again.

16:07.658 --> 16:10.065
- This is getting ridiculous.
- This is getting ridiculous.

16:10.244 --> 16:11.821
No, eerie is more like it.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.911
I will be right back.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.907
Don't worry, I'll just keep freezing
them until they give up.

16:19.128 --> 16:22.248
You're a miserable witch.

16:23.257 --> 16:24.882
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.878
I feel like calling a shrink
for some reason.

16:27.095 --> 16:29.171
Okay, I put it in the...

16:30.390 --> 16:32.050
Attic, attic.

16:35.103 --> 16:36.763
Nothing.

16:36.938 --> 16:39.145
I think that's good enough
for now, Morris.

16:39.316 --> 16:41.189
I'm sorry about all this, Prue.
I really am.

16:41.359 --> 16:44.277
- Yeah, I know.
- Come on, Trudeau. Let's go.

16:53.163 --> 16:54.658
Witches.

16:56.250 --> 16:59.785
- Well, did the police find the tiara?
- No.

16:59.962 --> 17:02.632
Piper kept freezing them,
then moving it.

17:02.840 --> 17:06.885
Well, how can we frame her if they
can't even find the evidence?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.305
We're gonna have to up the stakes.

17:16.563 --> 17:18.390
Somebody is obviously trying
to set me up,

17:18.565 --> 17:20.473
and they're using magic to do it.

17:20.651 --> 17:23.521
- But who? And how?
- Pick a warlock, any warlock.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.269
Hey, what were the police
doing here?

17:26.699 --> 17:28.241
Oh, nothing much really.

17:28.951 --> 17:31.157
Is it all right if I go up and fix
the bathroom sink?

17:31.745 --> 17:33.572
Oh, knock yourself out, Leo.

17:36.167 --> 17:38.788
Did anyone ever think
that maybe he's a warlock?

17:40.421 --> 17:43.173
Why is it always someone I'm dating
that gets accused of being that?

17:44.342 --> 17:48.091
Don't answer that.
Answer that, it's safer.

17:50.890 --> 17:52.599
Hello.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.934
Oh, yeah. Hi, Rex.
Look, I'm on my way in. It's...

17:59.399 --> 18:02.021
Of course. Hold on.

18:02.194 --> 18:03.985
It's for you.

18:07.741 --> 18:11.574
Hello. Yes, I got the flowers,
and they're beautiful.

18:11.746 --> 18:13.869
That was so sweet of you.

18:14.624 --> 18:17.162
They made quite an impression
over here too.

18:18.169 --> 18:19.711
A dinner party?

18:20.421 --> 18:23.672
Yes, I would love to.
Hold on, let me grab a pen.

18:26.928 --> 18:30.095
- So, what are you gonna do?
- What can I do?

18:30.265 --> 18:32.637
My sister's dating my boss.
I don't really have a...

18:32.976 --> 18:35.977
I meant about who's setting you up.
Do you have any idea who it could be?

18:36.146 --> 18:38.103
It's gotta be somebody
at the auction house.

18:38.273 --> 18:40.100
If I had to guess,
I'd start with the person

18:40.275 --> 18:41.983
who said that they were
out to destroy me.

18:42.361 --> 18:43.736
Hannah?

18:44.238 --> 18:46.231
Smart girl.

19:40.922 --> 19:45.086
Leo, what are you doing? I thought
you were going to fix the sink.

19:45.427 --> 19:48.096
Yeah, I was. I mean, I am. I just...

19:48.722 --> 19:50.430
I need to fix a light downstairs,

19:50.599 --> 19:52.924
and I was hoping there'd be some
old fixtures up here,

19:53.102 --> 19:54.928
you know, that I could cannibalise.

19:56.564 --> 20:00.561
Listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

20:00.776 --> 20:03.481
Something I don't think
you're gonna like.

20:03.905 --> 20:07.190
I might have to leave here soon.

20:08.951 --> 20:11.324
I might have to go back home.

20:13.248 --> 20:16.284
- Is home far away?
- Yeah, it's pretty far.

20:18.253 --> 20:19.795
I mean, I don't know for sure yet,

20:19.963 --> 20:22.881
but, you know,
I wanted you to know just in case.

20:24.134 --> 20:25.628
Thanks.

20:26.470 --> 20:31.298
Well, I better get to work.

21:11.433 --> 21:15.348
You will see
a spectacular apartment.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.687
Phoebe, I am so glad
that you could make it. Please.

21:24.489 --> 21:26.861
- Wow, this is...
- Spectacular?

21:27.033 --> 21:29.489
That is exactly the word
I was gonna use.

21:29.661 --> 21:32.413
We must be on
the same wavelength.

21:32.581 --> 21:34.620
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

21:34.791 --> 21:36.950
No, I insist.

21:40.339 --> 21:42.912
- Am I early?
- No, you're right on time.

21:43.092 --> 21:45.713
But I thought you said
you were having a dinner party.

21:45.886 --> 21:50.844
Yes, I am.
With a very exclusive guest list.

21:51.058 --> 21:52.885
Just you and me.

21:58.649 --> 22:00.227
A toast.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.234
- To your interview.
- Interview?

22:04.489 --> 22:06.363
<i>Yeah, at Zeitgeist magazine.</i>

22:07.325 --> 22:10.362
They want to meet with you,
you know, perhaps hire you

22:10.537 --> 22:12.446
for the fashion section.

22:12.622 --> 22:15.458
- Interested?
- Very.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.791
- But what's the catch?
- You have to sleep with me.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.790
Phoebe, what sort of man
do you think I am?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.967
I hope you like sushi.
Imported fresh from Kyöto.

22:30.725 --> 22:34.094
Please, just make yourself
comfortable.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.781
You're having a premonition
of Prue at work.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.412
<i>She's in danger.
You fear a warlock's after her.</i>

22:57.586 --> 22:59.080
<i>You must save her.</i>

23:00.089 --> 23:01.832
Prue.

23:08.014 --> 23:11.632
I gotta go. I'm really sorry,
and I can't explain,

23:11.809 --> 23:16.139
but I'll call you, okay?

23:16.356 --> 23:19.061
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

23:27.909 --> 23:29.285
911?

23:29.453 --> 23:31.244
I'm calling from
Buckland's Auction House.

23:31.413 --> 23:35.281
I think someone's trying to kill me.
Please hurry.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.048
Working late?

23:47.221 --> 23:49.463
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

23:49.682 --> 23:52.600
It's okay.
I guess I'm just a little jumpy lately.

23:52.810 --> 23:55.052
Can't blame you,
with everything that's been going on.

23:55.438 --> 23:57.016
Yeah.

23:57.983 --> 24:00.271
Listen, Jaime, I was wondering,

24:00.443 --> 24:03.528
when the tiara was stolen,
was anyone else still here,

24:03.739 --> 24:06.693
like Hannah or Rex maybe?

24:06.867 --> 24:09.702
No, you were the last one out.
Just like tonight.

24:09.870 --> 24:12.575
Hardest-working woman
I've ever met.

24:12.748 --> 24:15.500
For what it's worth, Prue,
I know you didn't take it.

24:15.876 --> 24:18.830
I mean, of all people...
There's no way.

24:19.505 --> 24:21.297
Thanks.

24:27.221 --> 24:28.846
Hannah's computer.

24:56.961 --> 25:01.173
Someone's after you. Behind you.

25:01.340 --> 25:05.670
You fear it's a warlock
with powers greater than yours.

25:12.227 --> 25:14.979
You hear a scream. An innocent
to protect in the warehouse.

25:15.147 --> 25:18.931
- Jaime.
- Grab the artefact just inside the door.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.636
Jaime.

25:47.931 --> 25:49.473
Jaime.

25:49.641 --> 25:51.301
Prue!

25:53.270 --> 25:56.769
- Phoebe.
- Thank God you're all right.

25:57.065 --> 25:58.725
He's dead.

26:14.876 --> 26:16.204
The tape found by the body?

26:16.377 --> 26:18.619
Security. Showing Prue
exiting the vault,

26:18.796 --> 26:20.789
putting the missing tiara
in her briefcase.

26:21.257 --> 26:24.211
- What? That can't be.
- Just saw it for myself.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.133
Somebody must've manipulated me
into taking it.

26:27.347 --> 26:28.972
The same way someone
manipulated me

26:29.182 --> 26:31.222
into being a witness
against my own sister.

26:31.810 --> 26:34.384
- Any idea what they're talking about?
- Not a clue.

26:34.563 --> 26:36.141
You were with Rex tonight,
weren't you?

26:36.523 --> 26:39.608
Yeah, Prue, but I don't think this
is the time or place to get into that.

26:39.777 --> 26:43.027
No, I just meant that don't you
find it a little coincidental

26:43.197 --> 26:45.688
that right when you guys start
dating, all this is going on?

26:45.908 --> 26:49.526
No. And besides, I thought you thought
that Hannah was behind all of this.

26:49.704 --> 26:51.862
- I do.
- Excuse us. Ladies.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.866
Do you mind if we ask
a few questions?

26:54.083 --> 26:56.123
I already told you
what happened, okay?

26:56.294 --> 27:00.339
I was working late, I heard a noise,
I came down here and found Jaime.

27:00.548 --> 27:02.874
- You didn't know he had the tape?
- No, of course not.

27:03.051 --> 27:05.673
And why exactly did you pick up
the murder weapon again?

27:05.887 --> 27:08.557
- You think she killed him, is that it?
- Phoebe.

27:08.724 --> 27:11.678
No, I wanna know how far
he's gonna go with this.

27:11.894 --> 27:15.097
None of this has anything to do with
the fact that she dumped you, does it?

27:15.272 --> 27:16.850
- Stop it.
- Look, we got Prue

27:17.024 --> 27:21.069
standing over the body of the security
guard who last saw her with the tiara.

27:21.237 --> 27:24.273
With the missing security tape
showing her taking it.

27:24.490 --> 27:27.028
And holding the murder weapon,
which you were there to witness.

27:27.201 --> 27:29.574
- What are we supposed to think?
- That I'm guilty as hell.

27:29.746 --> 27:31.537
You know she didn't do this.

27:31.706 --> 27:36.498
Then who did? Did you see anybody
run past you on the way in here?

27:36.670 --> 27:37.998
No.

27:39.339 --> 27:42.423
- I'm sorry, Prue. Brian.
- Yeah?

27:44.344 --> 27:47.179
You're under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

27:52.686 --> 27:54.893
- We should hire a lawyer.
- With what money?

27:55.064 --> 27:57.389
I don't know, but we can't
let her sit in jail all night.

27:57.566 --> 28:00.236
That's why we're here,
to get Rex's help.

28:05.783 --> 28:07.575
What are you doing?

28:17.379 --> 28:19.371
This is so weird.

28:19.548 --> 28:21.873
Are you sure this is the right place?

28:25.095 --> 28:27.765
This is my lipstick. I'm positive.

28:28.098 --> 28:29.842
He couldn't have moved out so fast.

28:31.894 --> 28:35.014
It must've been an illusion.
All of it.

28:35.189 --> 28:38.226
- Even my premonition.
- How is that possible?

28:38.442 --> 28:43.983
Mind control, astral projection,
throwing charms. Who knows?

28:44.157 --> 28:47.941
Prue was right about Rex,
which means I'm dating a warlock.

28:48.912 --> 28:50.620
Been there, done that.

28:59.131 --> 29:00.755
Hey.

29:16.649 --> 29:18.191
Hey.

29:18.943 --> 29:20.603
Hey.

29:21.029 --> 29:23.317
- You wanna talk?
- I'm just running background checks

29:23.490 --> 29:25.529
on all the other employees
at the auction house.

29:25.700 --> 29:27.989
- That's not what I meant, Andy.
- Andy?

29:28.161 --> 29:30.735
Did you call me by my first name?
Wasn't even sure you knew it.

29:31.289 --> 29:33.282
I heard Prue say it.

29:36.670 --> 29:38.497
She didn't do it, Morris.

29:38.714 --> 29:41.750
- You keep saying that.
- It's too pat, it's too easy.

29:41.925 --> 29:44.630
The evidence just keeps
falling in our laps.

29:46.138 --> 29:47.798
Maybe her sister was right.

29:47.973 --> 29:50.050
Maybe your personal feelings
are getting in the way.

29:50.226 --> 29:52.551
- We've had that conversation, okay?
- Okay.

29:52.770 --> 29:54.929
But you stopped seeing Prue
for a reason.

29:55.106 --> 29:56.933
You thought she was hiding
something from you.

29:57.233 --> 30:00.020
How do you know she wasn't
hiding something like this?

30:00.487 --> 30:02.978
A secret life of crime?

30:03.156 --> 30:05.908
- I don't think so.
- You got a better explanation?

30:13.917 --> 30:16.159
You wanna book her
into county jail?

30:16.336 --> 30:18.792
No, let's just keep her here
for as long as we can.

30:19.048 --> 30:21.124
At least until the arraignment.

30:25.805 --> 30:27.881
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.

30:28.057 --> 30:30.726
They can't bust Prue for murder
if they don't have a motive.

30:30.893 --> 30:33.847
- Mouth, Leo's in the kitchen.
- Oh, he is? Really?

30:34.022 --> 30:36.513
Focus. And think.

30:36.691 --> 30:39.147
The last thing we have to worry about
is the legal system.

30:39.319 --> 30:40.813
We're up against a warlock now.

30:40.987 --> 30:43.027
Two, if Prue's right about Hannah.

30:43.198 --> 30:46.152
Exactly. Which means we have
to figure out what they want.

30:46.410 --> 30:47.904
It can't just be to frame Prue.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.445
Unless in doing so they think
they can get our powers,

30:50.622 --> 30:51.951
which is what warlocks want.

30:52.124 --> 30:53.867
Which means
they're trying to divide us

30:54.043 --> 30:56.534
so that we don't have
the power of three to stop them.

30:57.087 --> 30:58.997
What are we gonna do?

31:00.966 --> 31:02.758
We have no choice.

31:08.057 --> 31:10.928
- Let's go.
- Go? Go where?

31:11.102 --> 31:14.139
- Phoebe.
- Piper, it's gonna be all right.

31:19.069 --> 31:20.527
This is crazy.

31:20.695 --> 31:23.068
We have to get Prue out
before Rex makes his move on us.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.075
- But we can't break her out.
- Yes, we can. We're witches.

31:26.243 --> 31:29.244
All you have to do is freeze the guards
and then unlock Prue's cell.

31:29.413 --> 31:31.240
Me? What about you?

31:31.415 --> 31:34.333
Somebody's gotta stay out here
in case something goes wrong.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.625
- Ready? On three.
- No, Phoebe.

31:36.837 --> 31:38.664
Three.

31:43.219 --> 31:45.176
Totally cool power. I hate you.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.468
What are you doing?

32:01.321 --> 32:03.361
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just so we're clear,

32:03.532 --> 32:05.323
- this was Phoebe's idea.
- What?

32:05.492 --> 32:07.781
We think Rex is a warlock,
and he's after our powers.

32:07.953 --> 32:10.195
Phoebe's waiting outside for you
to rub her nose in it.

32:11.624 --> 32:14.329
Well, come on, Prue,
before they unfreeze.

32:14.502 --> 32:17.372
- Piper, this isn't right.
- Well, neither is the gas chamber.

32:17.588 --> 32:22.001
If we're lucky, we'll vanquish them and
get you back here by morning rounds.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.045
- That's pretty lame.
- You got a better idea?

32:26.264 --> 32:27.924
- No.
- Let's go.

32:34.606 --> 32:36.729
Don't touch them. Don't touch them.
Don't!

32:36.900 --> 32:38.478
Come on!

32:38.944 --> 32:40.403
Come on.

32:41.697 --> 32:43.025
Quite photogenic.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.574
Now, I should think the police will find
this very interesting, to say the least.

32:46.744 --> 32:48.783
- Rex.
- Wait, how did you know that we...?

32:48.954 --> 32:51.362
What, that you'd be here?
Well, let's just say that

32:51.540 --> 32:54.791
I've been watching your every move.
Without your knowing it, of course.

32:54.961 --> 32:56.752
You bastard.

32:57.213 --> 32:59.170
Don't get too angry, Prue.

32:59.340 --> 33:02.092
You really wouldn't want to injure me
with your power.

33:02.260 --> 33:04.336
I'm the only chance you have.

33:04.679 --> 33:07.217
Whilst you were conducting
your little prison break,

33:07.432 --> 33:09.555
Hannah was retrieving
the tiara from your home.

33:10.060 --> 33:12.467
You should've gotten rid of it
whilst you had the chance.

33:12.646 --> 33:14.852
Personally, I actually thought
that was an excellent idea.

33:15.482 --> 33:17.391
- Astral projection.
- What do you want?

33:17.901 --> 33:21.105
Your powers, of course. That's why
I hired you in the first place.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.438
You know, to see if you really were
the Charmed Ones.

33:23.616 --> 33:28.159
Then I waited, to test your strength,
to see how best to make my move.

33:28.329 --> 33:30.784
- And here we are.
- But why all the drama?

33:30.957 --> 33:33.198
Why didn't you just kill us
and take our powers?

33:33.376 --> 33:35.084
Don't give him any ideas.

33:35.294 --> 33:37.667
No, no, no. I have seen exactly
what you can do

33:37.839 --> 33:41.919
when you've been confronted directly.
That is why I opted for blackmail.

33:43.053 --> 33:45.674
<i>See, there is a special spell
in The Book of Shadows</i>

33:45.847 --> 33:49.430
that strips you of your powers forever.

33:49.601 --> 33:54.014
And this device
will capture those powers.

33:54.231 --> 33:56.852
- And you'll bring them to me.
- Go to hell.

33:57.067 --> 33:59.902
Yeah, I'd love to, darling.
I miss it terribly.

34:00.070 --> 34:02.146
But this will help me return
with honours.

34:02.656 --> 34:07.117
In return, I'll give you the photo and tell
the police I simply misplaced the tiara.

34:07.453 --> 34:09.991
No theft, no motive for murder,
no prison.

34:10.164 --> 34:13.284
You really don't have much time.
Just until the prison guards

34:13.458 --> 34:14.918
realize you've escaped.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.213
Well?

34:30.143 --> 34:34.188
It's a relinquishment spell. If we read it
aloud, it takes away all of our powers.

34:34.356 --> 34:37.025
- Is there any way to reverse it?
- I don't know, it doesn't say.

34:37.192 --> 34:39.065
Well, then I say
we flip to another page

34:39.235 --> 34:41.810
and find a spell
that kicks Rex's warlock ass.

34:41.989 --> 34:43.400
- We can't.
- Why can't we?

34:43.616 --> 34:46.284
Because for all we know,
he's here right now watching us.

34:46.911 --> 34:50.245
And if we don't do exactly as he says,
he'll tell the police I've escaped.

34:50.415 --> 34:52.242
We can't give up our powers
without a fight.

34:52.417 --> 34:54.742
It's like giving up who we are,
who we've become.

34:54.918 --> 34:57.327
- Who we've come from.
- Exactly.

34:57.505 --> 35:00.791
These powers are gifts.
Gifts that were given to us to protect

35:00.967 --> 35:03.803
and, ultimately, to pass on
to the next generation.

35:03.970 --> 35:07.340
Don't you think that I know that?
I mean, how do you think I feel?

35:07.558 --> 35:09.550
I'm the one who got us
into this situation.

35:09.768 --> 35:11.346
- Prue, it's not your fault.
- It's not.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.513
Yeah, but I'm the one
that Rex tricked.

35:13.731 --> 35:15.973
I'm the reason why
we're having this conversation.

35:16.358 --> 35:18.398
There has gotta be a way
out of this.

35:18.819 --> 35:20.230
Like what, become fugitives?

35:20.446 --> 35:23.649
Something tells me that's not
the best way to protect the innocent.

35:23.825 --> 35:26.398
Yeah, well, we can't protect
the innocent without our powers.

35:26.619 --> 35:29.953
And even worse, if we give them up,
we'd be giving them up to evil.

35:30.373 --> 35:31.748
No, we can't let that happen.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.830
Well, we can't let you die
in jail either.

35:35.045 --> 35:39.506
Besides, with you behind bars,
we'll be divided. Rex wins either way.

35:41.385 --> 35:43.377
- I don't wanna have to do this.
- Neither do I,

35:43.553 --> 35:44.834
but we don't have a choice.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.763
All we can do
is take the leap of faith

35:46.932 --> 35:48.640
and hope that somehow
it all works out.

35:56.525 --> 35:58.399
<i>"From whence they came
Return them now</i>

35:58.569 --> 36:01.523
<i>Vanish the words
Vanish our powers"</i>

36:01.697 --> 36:03.690
<i>"From whence they came
Return them now</i>

36:03.866 --> 36:06.155
<i>Vanish the words
Vanish our powers"</i>

36:08.329 --> 36:10.239
Come on, Phoebe.

36:11.916 --> 36:16.662
<i>Okay. "From whence they came
Return them now</i>

36:16.838 --> 36:20.373
<i>Vanish the words
Vanish our powers"</i>

36:43.324 --> 36:45.317
Look.

36:50.290 --> 36:53.042
- Well, it was fun while it lasted.
- Yep.

36:54.544 --> 36:56.584
Let's get this over with.

37:00.467 --> 37:02.211
They're coming.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.511
Good.

37:18.111 --> 37:19.902
Love you too, darling.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.262
Why, Hannah, you've changed.

37:46.724 --> 37:49.393
Dead 08/20/98.

37:57.569 --> 37:59.811
He died 8/20/98.

38:06.995 --> 38:09.202
Mr Morris. Trudeau.

38:09.373 --> 38:12.658
Get your butt over here,
I think I figured out who framed Prue.

38:14.878 --> 38:17.666
Okay, I say as soon as we get
the photo and the tiara back,

38:17.840 --> 38:20.592
we knock the lantern out of Rex's
hands and stomp on it.

38:20.759 --> 38:23.429
- What will that do?
- I don't know, free our powers?

38:23.596 --> 38:26.882
- It's better than doing nothing.
- How do we know this isn't a trap?

38:27.058 --> 38:31.221
You don't, actually. Nevertheless,
here you are. Powerless, I presume.

38:31.688 --> 38:34.891
- Where's Hannah?
- Lurking. It's what she does best.

38:35.108 --> 38:37.860
The lantern, if you please.

38:41.615 --> 38:46.028
It all feels a little anticlimactic,
don't you think? Too easy almost.

38:47.287 --> 38:51.617
Feels as if we need
a more satisfying ending.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.072
No.

39:36.088 --> 39:38.247
Hannah, now. Quickly!

39:43.596 --> 39:46.882
- Wait, we have our powers back?
- How?

39:47.100 --> 39:49.176
Doesn't matter.
Get out of here fast.

40:10.875 --> 40:12.452
Rex.

40:13.169 --> 40:14.711
No.

40:16.923 --> 40:18.465
What have you done?

40:21.427 --> 40:23.835
But it wasn't my fault.

40:24.013 --> 40:26.136
I didn't fail, he did!

40:27.016 --> 40:29.638
No! Please, no!

40:41.365 --> 40:43.322
What the hell was that?

40:43.492 --> 40:46.446
I think you just answered
your own question.

40:46.620 --> 40:50.239
Okay, well, you gotta get me
back to jail now. Let's go.

40:54.712 --> 40:57.037
We're here to see Prue Halliwell.

40:58.967 --> 41:01.339
- Thanks, Eric.
- Thanks a lot.

41:11.104 --> 41:12.646
Prue?

41:22.533 --> 41:24.407
Andy, what is it? What's going on?

41:24.618 --> 41:26.492
Thought you'd like to know
you're off the hook.

41:26.704 --> 41:29.871
Turns out you were right.
Rex and Hannah were setting you up.

41:30.041 --> 41:33.457
- Or whoever they were.
- I don't understand.

41:33.628 --> 41:35.170
Well, we think they killed
two people,

41:35.338 --> 41:37.710
assumed their identities,
then took over the auction house.

41:37.882 --> 41:41.880
Then they bilked it dry and tried
to cap it off with stealing the tiara.

41:42.053 --> 41:44.379
Which we found hidden in his office.

41:44.848 --> 41:46.508
Wow, did you catch them?

41:47.517 --> 41:49.309
Not yet.

41:49.478 --> 41:51.517
I don't suppose you have any idea

41:51.855 --> 41:54.429
what this was doing
in his office, do you?

41:55.859 --> 41:57.817
- Quite photogenic.
- Isn't it?

42:03.284 --> 42:05.953
Spells, incantations, demon stuff.
It's all here.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.745
Everything. Just like before.

42:07.914 --> 42:09.705
- Thank God.
- But how?

42:09.874 --> 42:13.077
- I mean, we didn't reverse the spell.
- Well, maybe we screwed it up.

42:14.504 --> 42:16.543
What? It's not like it would be
the first time.

42:16.714 --> 42:20.048
No, we didn't screw it up. Something
or someone must have done it.

42:20.218 --> 42:24.050
- It couldn't have happened on its own.
- Why not? It's magic.

42:25.140 --> 42:27.631
- Knock, knock.
- Leo.

42:27.809 --> 42:31.938
I... The front door was open.
I hope it's all right. I left my tool box.

42:35.025 --> 42:37.398
That's funny, I don't remember
that being there last night.

42:37.570 --> 42:40.654
Yeah, well, you know what Freud
always said about leaving things.

42:40.823 --> 42:43.279
That you secretly
wanted to come back for it.

42:43.492 --> 42:45.900
- Guilty.
- Don't use that word.

42:47.246 --> 42:49.239
It's a long story. Never mind.

42:56.131 --> 43:00.294
- You're leaving, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

43:01.136 --> 43:03.544
- Do you really have to go?
- Well, I've fixed everything

43:03.722 --> 43:05.050
I came here to fix.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.390
But I'll be back. Promise.

43:16.944 --> 43:19.779
Nothing could keep me
away from you too long.

43:28.873 --> 43:30.913
Well, at least he wasn't a warlock.

43:31.084 --> 43:36.161
Hey, you don't suppose Leo
was the...? What are you doing?

43:36.339 --> 43:38.332
Getting rid
of the relinquishment spell.

43:38.508 --> 43:41.924
However we got our powers back,
I don't wanna risk losing them again.

43:42.095 --> 43:44.172
- I second that.
- Third.

43:44.348 --> 43:46.305
So witches forever?

43:46.475 --> 43:49.429
And damn proud of it.
