WEBVTT

00:35.360 --> 00:36.200
Press that button.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.040
What's that?

00:38.480 --> 00:39.760
It's a time machine.

00:40.880 --> 00:41.960
Press that button.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.720
<i>We're going back in time now.</i>

00:49.680 --> 00:50.880
<i>To Monday of last week.</i>

00:52.880 --> 00:54.800
<i>To the moment when you told me.</i>

00:55.360 --> 00:57.040
I am HIV-positive.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.880
<i>But this time, I don't stand there</i>
<i>not knowing what to say.</i>

01:05.520 --> 01:06.560
I don't care.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.360
That's not true, I do care.
It makes me like you even more.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.600
Something huge happened,
and you've overcome it.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.360
It makes me want to know you
more than before.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.120
Have I fixed it?
If not, I'll keep trying until I do.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.880
Nailed it the first time.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.320
Great, because this was a doorbell
for science class.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.960
I was never able to make it ring.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.000
Congratulations.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.400
This exam deserves a ten.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.080
Well, so did one of your classmates',

01:59.160 --> 02:02.320
and you know
that here we grade on a curve, so...

02:02.640 --> 02:03.520
I'm sorry.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.720
Excuse me, on a what?

02:06.720 --> 02:10.200
Didn't they explain this to you?
Let me show you. Look.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.200
This curve maps human intelligence.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.640
On one end is a minority
with low intellectual ability.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.880
On the other, there is a minority
which is extremely intelligent.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.600
And the majority...

02:26.520 --> 02:27.840
falls here in the middle.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.840
Let's assume the class
is a sample of society.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.640
There's one with a ten, one with a zero.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.240
The rest are here.
There can never be two tens, or two zeros.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.000
So the grades are assigned
before the exam.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.760
That's right. If you're in the lower 20%,
you fail even if you did well.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.520
-Damn, that's why I always flunk.
-Isn't that a bit unfair?

02:48.760 --> 02:50.760
Guys, this prepares you for life.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.880
Out there, if you're in the lowest 20%,
you don't get anything.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.760
And on the podium,
there can't be two people.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.320
If you have any complaints,
come to my office hours.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.360
LEARN ABOUT
ADOPTION AND OLDER CHILDREN

03:13.440 --> 03:14.920
Sorry.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.080
OMAR, ARE YOU THERE? ARE YOU NOT GOING
TO TALK TO ME? FORGIVE ME

03:43.160 --> 03:44.960
HELLO...

03:48.440 --> 03:49.280
Hello.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.800
-When is our next dinner for three?
<i>-</i>I don't know.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.240
The fish was actually very good
the other night,

03:58.400 --> 04:00.000
the meat, not so much.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.120
You didn't even try the meat.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.400
How about dinner just for the two of us?

04:04.920 --> 04:06.240
You know that can't be.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.120
No problem, I'll go on a diet, then.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.000
Too bad, I was looking forward to it.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.120
Shame, I am tired of feeling
like a dick with legs.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.480
I am good for a lot more.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.560
It's true. You're right.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.320
Want to come to a party
with celebrities?

04:21.480 --> 04:23.440
It's a benefit cocktail party.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.600
Some 100 guests gorging themselves
on seafood and champagne,

04:27.880 --> 04:30.480
because they're super worried
about world hunger.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.360
And then, with the funds they raise,
they buy cans of chickpeas for the poor.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.400
Right.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.960
I'm going because my father's making me.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.960
Champagne, luxury, seafood...

04:45.760 --> 04:47.000
What a drag!

04:48.840 --> 04:50.640
Would you like to come with me?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.480
Would you like me to go?

04:54.600 --> 04:55.440
Of course.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.960
<i>Tell me about Pablo Ruiz.</i>

04:57.280 --> 05:01.680
They say you expelled him two years ago
for having sex with Marina.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.000
She was 14, he 17.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.520
I didn't expel anybody. He left.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.720
Do you have any way of contacting him?

05:09.240 --> 05:12.160
No. Is there anything else?

05:25.440 --> 05:27.440
Is this another plan
you hatched with your friend?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.360
I don't talk to Lu anymore, Nadia.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.520
I want to make it up to you.
What I did was wrong.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.160
I was an asshole.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.000
A gift only proves
you're an asshole with money.

05:37.480 --> 05:41.360
What do you want? I've tried everything.
I mean it.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.440
Tell me what to do, so you'll forgive me.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.760
In my culture,

05:49.800 --> 05:53.240
you haven't only insulted me,
but also my family.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.080
-So first, you'll have to go through them.
-Sorry?

05:56.600 --> 05:57.440
Precisely.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.560
Ask for their forgiveness. Muslim style.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.360
Go before my parents

06:02.680 --> 06:05.920
and explain to them that you tried
to take my virginity,

06:06.240 --> 06:07.520
to then mock me.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.760
And ask for leniency...

06:10.200 --> 06:12.200
-on your knees.
-On my knees?

06:12.680 --> 06:14.960
Is your family from <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

06:41.240 --> 06:43.120
With this, we'll forget about the money.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.920
The address is on the back
of the photo.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.120
No.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.440
No way, I'm not killing anybody.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.880
Who said anything about killing?
A warning, on the leg.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.640
So he learns he should pay his debts.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.000
How do you feel?

07:41.600 --> 07:45.240
Like fucking James Bond. License to brag.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.320
But this is too much.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.760
Federico, how about we take it in
a bit more there?

07:50.720 --> 07:51.920
He's gonna make you look great.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.120
Don't let him fix anything,
or I'll have to buy it.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.840
The moment he walks in the door,
Federico accepts the charge.

07:56.920 --> 08:01.240
He's like a plumber, then,
charges just for showing up.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.680
What does a suit made to measure
like this cost?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.120
Don't worry about that.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.880
He's always worked with us and gives us
a discount. Charge it to our account.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.040
No way!

08:10.120 --> 08:12.560
OK, it's a loan.
You'll repay it when you can.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.160
So how much is this suit?

08:15.040 --> 08:16.120
More than 300 bucks?

08:17.480 --> 08:18.320
More than 500?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.640
More than 1000?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.520
Could we have a moment?

08:26.160 --> 08:28.360
I don't care how much it costs.
It's a present.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.560
It's not my birthday or my name day.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.480
I haven't passed all my classes...
or any, for that matter.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.040
What you've given us
is worth much more than a suit.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.480
Before we met you,
Polo and I were not doing very well.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.240
And now, look at us... better than ever.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.400
Since we're here, I can't imagine 007
with a cheap watch.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.920
Which one do you like?

08:53.280 --> 08:54.520
This one's cool, huh?

08:57.680 --> 08:59.960
SO, SHOULD I BUY THE SUIT?

09:00.040 --> 09:03.040
No! Only those people are attending?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.040
And you're telling me now?

09:06.120 --> 09:08.160
Make something up.
Tell them there's canapés,

09:08.240 --> 09:09.760
you'll see how many come.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.320
Dad?

09:12.040 --> 09:14.880
-I'm going to need another invitation.
-For whom?

09:15.480 --> 09:17.240
For Samuel, the boy from the party.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.360
Not a chance.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.120
Why not?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.920
I don't want him in the photos,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.720
in case somebody
from the press recognizes him

09:23.800 --> 09:25.680
and they start talking
about the school again.

09:25.760 --> 09:26.720
Is that reason enough?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.680
When it suited you,
you wanted to have photos taken with him.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.080
Darling, we organized this
to put that issue behind us.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.120
Oh! I thought it was about the homeless.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
Marina, we all win here.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.640
OK? I get good press, yes,
but they get a roof over their heads.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.560
Don't they?

09:44.160 --> 09:46.000
As long as it doesn't fall
on their heads...

09:46.240 --> 09:48.440
Don't play with tomorrow's event.

09:58.160 --> 10:00.520
OF COURSE, ALREADY HAVE YOUR INVITE

10:10.240 --> 10:11.560
Is my pronunciation that bad?

10:12.760 --> 10:14.240
Open the fucking door!

10:17.800 --> 10:20.520
What are you doing here?
I don't give a damn about your friend.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.040
OK, you don't give a damn about Ander,
I don't give a damn about you. Move.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.640
Are your parents here?
I need to talk to them.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.280
It's OK. I'm used to seeing her
like this at school.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.480
What?

10:42.280 --> 10:43.120
Hello.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.320
Sit with us.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.320
Do you need a fork?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.120
I've been to Egypt,
but they didn't eat like this.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.200
What do we have to do with Egypt?

11:05.960 --> 11:08.840
It's <i>mansaf, </i>typical of Palestine.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.160
Thank you. Thank you for your hospitality.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.600
We would have done it for anybody
who came to our home.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.520
Even if we don't know
what they're here for.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.080
I've come to ask for forgiveness.
For the other day at the store.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.360
I wanted to apologize
for trying to deceive--

11:32.200 --> 11:33.040
Goodbye.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.320
Goodbye.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.320
What are you doing?
And you told my father about the scarf!

11:44.480 --> 11:46.480
How was I to know you hadn't told him?

11:46.800 --> 11:50.320
-I only did what you asked me to do.
-Because I thought you wouldn't dare.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.720
That it was the only way
you'd leave me alone.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.120
Now you know it takes a lot more
to discourage me.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.880
For you, all of this
is just another challenge, huh?

12:02.480 --> 12:05.760
First, taking my virginity,
now, getting me to forgive you.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.320
What's next, conquering Everest?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.880
After you, Everest will be nothing.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.320
If you don't want to be a challenge,
why make it so hard?

12:17.080 --> 12:17.960
Guzmán...

12:19.400 --> 12:23.560
I don't want anything with you.
Because I think you're a bad person.

12:34.360 --> 12:38.760
Tomorrow...
we're throwing a benefit gala

12:40.240 --> 12:42.840
to raise funds for the homeless.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.960
Would a bad person do that?

12:50.680 --> 12:51.880
I don't think so.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.640
You're invited.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.840
Please, I'll pay you back
when I get paid at La Cabaña.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.720
I couldn't lend it to you if I wanted to.
I don't have that kind of money.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.200
Because you spend it all on smokes,
that's why.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.960
There are factors that give Nadia
an advantage, things that-- Lu.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.440
Please.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.920
All the things
that she's been able to overcome.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.480
-Her coming from a worse school, midyear--
-And is that my fault?

13:47.320 --> 13:50.360
I'm just trying to balance things
so there's a little more justice.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.160
That's all. OK?

13:52.720 --> 13:56.440
Martín,
all of this about peace in the world...

13:57.640 --> 13:59.440
is it because of the adoption thing?

14:00.480 --> 14:04.160
-Sorry?
-The web page on your laptop yesterday.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.520
It belonged to a foundation
for adopting older children.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.720
Very generous.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.960
But I think people prefer small children.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.280
Unless they're not approved for adoption.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.400
I guess it's on account
of your shitty salary

14:20.480 --> 14:22.360
and your wife being unemployed, right?

14:22.600 --> 14:25.800
-Have you been investigating us?
-No, not investigating.

14:25.880 --> 14:29.840
This is the 21st century.
Everything's on social media. For example,

14:30.200 --> 14:33.000
that she hasn't had a job in two years.
That's on LinkedIn.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.000
She's a preschool teacher,
so she likes children.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.280
According to Facebook,
you've been married for eight years...

14:39.680 --> 14:40.600
and nothing.

14:40.920 --> 14:45.880
And on Twitter, she follows all of Spain's
adoption and foster care agencies.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.960
-She seems a bit desperate, right?
-What are you doing, Lucrecia?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.840
My father has excellent contacts
in Mexico.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.120
A few phone calls,
and you could have a beautiful child.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.720
Faster than you can have a pizza
at your door.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.400
-Color and size of your choice.
-And you want nothing in return, huh?

15:04.480 --> 15:07.680
Just to be the best beyond any doubt
at the end of the school year.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.560
-Because I am the best.
-Get out.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.760
Not having children can result
in a separation.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.080
And it would be very sad
if the next profile of your wife's I see

15:20.080 --> 15:21.000
were on Tinder.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.760
Pablo gave up a scholarship to study
at the country's best school.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.920
No.
Marina's parents persuaded him to do it.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.000
How?

15:33.880 --> 15:35.400
With money, what else?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.160
Pablo had sex with a minor.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.480
If they wanted to get rid of him,
they just had to report him.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.320
They actually paid him
not to go to the police.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.720
So he wouldn't report what happened
that Monday afternoon.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.960
It's fine, right? As good as new.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.840
It's not swollen.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.640
Does it hurt a lot?

16:09.480 --> 16:10.320
Yes.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.360
I'd be cautious
and leave it bandaged another week.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.160
Then, if things persist,
we'd run further tests

16:16.240 --> 16:18.040
to see what the problem is.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.080
Well, that's it, then.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.600
Do you wear your hijab in class?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.160
Don't lie to me, Nadia.

16:33.680 --> 16:34.520
Not you.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.880
They forbade it, Dad.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.520
I had no choice.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.480
I would have been expelled.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.400
Why do you want to keep attending
a school with those rules?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.680
Because thanks to that school,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.520
I can one day be
one of those who make the rules.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.720
Not one who needs to obey them.

17:04.680 --> 17:08.280
-Don't let them change you, Nadia.
-Dad, why are you always saying that?

17:09.640 --> 17:11.160
Because they're already doing it.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.120
You didn't use to keep things from us.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.920
DISCREET19
HELO. WHAT'S UP?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I LIKE YOUR PROFILE
WANNA MEET?

17:34.080 --> 17:35.080
What's up, man?

17:35.720 --> 17:37.840
Well.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.400
How much was that?

17:39.680 --> 17:41.240
Doesn't matter.
I'll return it tomorrow.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.520
Unbelievable, man.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.400
Now that you go to that good school,
you're a total punk.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.480
So, what about this girl?

17:49.720 --> 17:51.720
-Are you serious?
-You mean Marina?

17:52.080 --> 17:52.920
Of course.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.680
-I don't know, why?
-Nothing in particular.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.600
It's just that now you'll ignore me.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.880
Even more.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.680
Which is normal,
when one gets a girlfriend.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.040
What's weird is for a girl to like you.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.840
I had lost hope already.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.680
Get a girlfriend yourself,
and then we can go out together.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.160
Lu's decided to come.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.480
Hey, if it isn't Miss Mexico!

18:39.640 --> 18:41.400
Look at me, in formal attire!

18:41.480 --> 18:43.960
Like a soap opera leading man from 1999.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.560
Thank you.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.480
This is my charitable act for the night.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.160
Lu, if you're mad at me,
don't take it out on him.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.720
-Why don't we try to have a good time?
-OK.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.720
But it's quite clear you don't need me
to have a good time, dear.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.800
Then you're not mad.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.400
You're jealous.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.520
Let's go, boys.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.840
Pathetic!

19:23.560 --> 19:25.160
Let's talk for a moment, please.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.160
If you want to take your pet for a walk,
that's OK, but not here, Polo.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.320
He's a classmate, man. It's not a problem.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.000
If you want to ruin things by letting him
into your relationship, fine,

19:36.320 --> 19:39.160
but don't bring him here.
Much less in front of me.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.840
This is Carla's mother's place.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.320
-I can invite whoever I want.
-Do you do the inviting, or does she?

19:45.920 --> 19:50.680
-You see how she controls you, right?
-You'd rather control me yourself?

19:50.840 --> 19:52.920
I've been your best friend
since grade school!

19:53.000 --> 19:54.120
And I've been yours.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.800
And I remind you
that we've done things I'm not proud of.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.160
Things I haven't told anybody.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.800
And all because of you.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.920
Don't you ever forget that.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.840
Are you still not talking to me today?

20:15.680 --> 20:18.000
What is this? <i>Miracle of Marcelino?</i>

20:29.840 --> 20:30.760
Please!

20:31.960 --> 20:35.880
Now we just need the Muslim girl.
You didn't invite her, right?

20:36.560 --> 20:37.760
Oh, Guzmán.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.920
Please! She's not coming, of course.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.720
What happened?
Did she give you the Muslim brush-off?

20:44.240 --> 20:45.440
Great, isn't it?

20:45.600 --> 20:48.480
Looks like we are all
expanding our circle of friends.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.600
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.680
Samuel García.

20:51.880 --> 20:55.320
Samuel García...

20:55.400 --> 20:56.800
You're not on the list.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.560
-I'm not invited?
-No.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.840
-What's wrong?
-His name's not on the list.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.280
Do you know who I am?

21:03.360 --> 21:06.280
The hippie's gutsy.
Not even I would dare to say that.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.280
Marina, darling, we already said
you couldn't invite any friends.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.160
Mom, he's not my friend.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.000
He's my boyfriend.

21:17.960 --> 21:18.880
Samuel, let's go.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.520
Where are you going?

21:20.960 --> 21:21.840
What are you doing?

21:23.360 --> 21:24.280
Your tag's come out.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.920
Oh, he was going to return it!

21:28.080 --> 21:29.840
Try not to get it too dirty.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.000
You are an asshole, Guzmán.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.920
-Samuel.
-What?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.400
Why did you make me come
if I wasn't invited?

21:41.480 --> 21:44.880
I was mad that at the other party
you were used for my dad's pictures,

21:44.960 --> 21:46.600
-and you weren't allowed here.
-You're using me now.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.120
I'm an excuse to rebel
against your parents.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.880
Look, I had imagined many times

21:54.960 --> 21:57.680
the moment when we would decide
to be a couple. Many times.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.600
But it was never like this,
I assure you.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.760
Do you have your time machine on you?

22:31.360 --> 22:34.240
I'd love to go back...
a half hour, more or less.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.240
I'm sorry.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.760
Do you like me, Marina?

22:45.400 --> 22:47.640
-If this is about the HIV--
-You don't know me.

22:51.360 --> 22:54.720
Do you know what I thought when...
I found out Pablo had infected me?

22:56.840 --> 22:57.680
That...

22:57.880 --> 23:02.520
somehow that secret,
that thing we both shared,

23:04.720 --> 23:06.120
would bring us together.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.520
That thanks to the HIV,
we would always be together.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.520
That really is sick...

23:15.480 --> 23:16.400
and idiotic.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.400
And then he left. Without saying goodbye.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.360
Can I tell you a secret?

23:31.640 --> 23:33.440
You can't travel through time.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.480
Or change the past.
So why not stop looking back...

23:42.240 --> 23:43.880
and start looking forward?

24:13.320 --> 24:15.200
Is this closer to what you had imagined?

24:21.120 --> 24:22.200
You have lipstick.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
You too.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.360
Marchioness!

24:37.320 --> 24:41.200
Your winery is the bomb,
and the wine, amazing!

24:41.440 --> 24:44.080
Delicious.
By the way, will there be a proper dinner?

24:44.280 --> 24:46.320
You wouldn't know
how to choose your cutlery.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.440
From the outside in.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.560
I've seen <i>Titanic </i>twice.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.640
Don't think you're the only one
who knows about movies.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.280
Hello.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.720
-Christian, right?
-Polo hasn't told us about you.

25:01.480 --> 25:04.320
-Do you like Las Encinas?
-Yes, actually, I do.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.480
That said,
I don't think the school likes me.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.520
I don't pass a single test, man.
And I do try.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.560
Some business about a curve,
some weird shit they have there.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.440
-What would you like to do?
-I want to be famous.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.480
Famous for doing what exactly?

25:21.120 --> 25:23.640
Good question.
The truth is, I don't know yet.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.600
Begoña, you're behind the times.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.520
Today, they don't want to do anything.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.840
They just want to be somebody,
and the less effort to get it, the better.

25:31.920 --> 25:32.960
-Right.
-Mom,

25:33.080 --> 25:35.600
how much effort did it take
to become a marchioness?

25:37.040 --> 25:40.400
Christian, I think it's very good
that you want to be somebody important.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.680
That shows ambition.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.080
We'd love that for our son.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.120
Mom!

25:54.720 --> 25:56.960
Dad, the photographers are here.

27:18.480 --> 27:25.160
WHEN TYRANNY IS LAW
REVOLUTION IS ORDER

27:27.400 --> 27:28.480
Why are you here?

27:30.160 --> 27:31.400
Are you here to see Fer?

27:32.560 --> 27:33.640
What's up?

27:37.040 --> 27:39.280
Need dough, right? Some extra money.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.960
-Who's this?
-He's Nano.

27:41.680 --> 27:42.640
A friend.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.440
Nano, this is Fer.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.720
I can give you stuff.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.760
-That's your territory.
-I don't care.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.240
There's plenty of customers.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.680
You're good to the point of being stupid.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.440
That's why I like working with him.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.160
Nobody thinks he's a dealer.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.160
-SENDING LOCATION
-OK

28:12.560 --> 28:13.720
But you...

28:14.520 --> 28:15.520
I have to go.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.280
Hope it goes well.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.360
Can I trust you?

28:23.840 --> 28:25.160
When did you get out?

28:26.640 --> 28:28.680
It's written all over your face.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.080
Not long ago.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.760
-Already trying to get back in?
-What about you?

28:37.600 --> 28:40.600
I have to pay for schools, diapers,

28:41.840 --> 28:42.680
and...

28:43.400 --> 28:45.560
for a big mess I got into
while in the can.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.200
What do you want? Pills, coke, pot?

28:51.280 --> 28:53.840
I want you to get your family
and go far away.

28:54.160 --> 28:57.000
Because the next guy they send
won't be as stupid as me.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.400
I'M HERE

29:25.400 --> 29:26.240
Hey.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.640
I am Discreet19.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.520
Come on, man, fuck off.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.480
Hey, wait! Let me apologize at least.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.760
-You made me come here for that?
-No.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.840
I made you come for the same reason
I created a fake username.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.440
I want to see you.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.320
I want to be with you.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.960
Kiss you, finish what we started.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.280
Don't you?

29:54.800 --> 29:57.880
This is what I get for meeting someone
who spells "hello" with one <i>l.</i>

29:59.560 --> 30:01.120
Besides, if you leave...

30:02.000 --> 30:05.080
you won't know what the 19 is about.
It's not my age.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.320
If the 19 business is as real
as the discreet part...

30:14.360 --> 30:15.600
there must be cameras here.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.560
I know some hideouts.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.480
He's an ace.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.240
-He is, better than his father.
-Excuse me.

30:41.320 --> 30:42.920
Better than his father?

30:43.040 --> 30:46.960
-We are improving the species.
-OK, then, my son is better than me.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.240
By the way...

30:48.320 --> 30:52.800
I LOVED IT. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENT.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT

30:55.680 --> 30:58.560
ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU COME HERE?

31:03.960 --> 31:05.440
Wait.

31:08.280 --> 31:11.400
Do you want to find out
if it's a girl or a boy?

31:11.480 --> 31:13.520
-I'm going to the bathroom, OK?
-Sure.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.080
What are you doing here?

31:44.160 --> 31:45.000
It can't be.

31:46.800 --> 31:50.280
What can't be?
That your athlete friend is gay?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.720
Or that he's involved
with a Muslim from the hood?

31:52.800 --> 31:56.360
-He could have told me, he's my friend.
-That's what I was thinking, too.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.000
Let them be.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.320
-I'll pay you for the suit tomorrow.
-Don't worry about it.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.160
Your parents... are mothers.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.360
They are two mothers.
Which is totally fine by me.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.840
I love lesbians. I could say I'm a fan.
I never miss any of their movies.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.480
You can keep them.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.000
Come on, my parents are tough on me, too.

32:28.160 --> 32:32.720
Would they also like you to be a writer,
or a musician, an artist?

32:33.400 --> 32:34.840
Somebody important, I mean.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.960
No, not at all.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.600
They'd be happy if I don't end up
on the streets, under a bridge.

32:39.040 --> 32:39.880
I see.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.240
At least they don't remind you
that you disappoint them.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.320
No.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.400
It's better to be reminded
that you're useless.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.440
And that they don't expect
anything from you.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.000
My mother's tired of showing off
the winery.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.400
Now she wants to show us off.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.680
She wants to introduce us to friends.

32:55.760 --> 32:59.960
Shit, if they were famous, maybe.
But I don't recognize any of them.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.800
The whole room might not even add up
to 10,000 followers!

33:03.040 --> 33:04.080
They're waiting.

33:04.160 --> 33:07.080
With all due respect...

33:07.360 --> 33:08.240
Fuck them!

33:08.880 --> 33:12.560
Let's go to your apartment
and finish the party there. I'm hungry.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.000
Come on!

33:17.800 --> 33:19.800
Marchioness, thank you very much.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.040
It's been a pleasure.
I love your winery, it's the bomb.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.240
I'm leaving.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.360
Thank you for the cava, marchioness!

33:34.000 --> 33:34.840
Carla!

33:50.880 --> 33:52.320
Come on!

34:05.960 --> 34:06.800
Hey.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.200
Why the hurry to see me?
What is it? Did you and Marina do it?

34:11.440 --> 34:13.280
Careful, I don't want details.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.880
How was your night?

34:15.440 --> 34:17.880
More boring than yours, I'm sure. At home.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.040
Omar, I know.

34:20.680 --> 34:22.440
I'm not the only one. Guzmán knows.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.240
What I don't know
is why you haven't told me.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.800
I only do it to make some money.
Don't freak out.

34:30.840 --> 34:31.800
Do you charge?

34:32.960 --> 34:35.760
Of course!
Did you expect me to do it for free?

34:35.840 --> 34:38.120
An NGO, "Dealers without Borders."

34:38.960 --> 34:41.920
-What are you talking about?
-What are you talking about?

34:42.720 --> 34:44.880
Omar, how could you get into that shit?

34:47.520 --> 34:51.320
I told you, Samu. You're not the only one
with friends from your new school.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.480
Yeah, but those friends
will make you end up like my brother.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.400
-Is that what you want?
-No.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.800
I want money, that's all.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.440
Then go and serve burgers.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.040
Like I do.

35:02.560 --> 35:06.080
I should remind you that we took
our resumes to La Cabaña together.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.280
But who did they call? Not the Muslim boy.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.000
The Muslim boy can only deal drugs, right?

35:11.160 --> 35:12.480
No, it's not that.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.160
-But that's easy for you to say.
-No, nothing's easy for me.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.800
Nor for your sister.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.840
Look at where she is and where you are.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.680
Why don't you fuck off
with your fucking girlfriend...

35:23.840 --> 35:25.840
and leave me alone, huh?

35:57.840 --> 35:58.840
Nice hijab.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.240
I wish I could say the same
about your shades.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.400
They're for the hangover.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.480
So, did you have a good time?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.880
Did you raise a lot of money?

36:12.520 --> 36:14.200
It doesn't matter. It was a farce.

36:14.760 --> 36:17.680
-How come?
-Just marketing for my father's company.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.280
I knew it.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.600
I participated, as usual.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.760
It was also so you would forgive me.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.800
If I were your father,
I wouldn't let you date me.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.200
Who said anything about dating?

36:35.160 --> 36:36.040
OK.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.680
Friends, then.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.720
I could use one.
I don't know if I have any left.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.520
-If you're trying to get me to pity you...
-I'm not trying anything, Nadia.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.720
There's no plan.
I don't want you to forgive me.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.480
I don't deserve it.

36:54.520 --> 36:55.600
I don't deserve you.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.880
Now you do.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.080
<i>After...</i>

37:16.600 --> 37:19.760
a complaint during office hours,
I've decided to change the grades.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.760
Nadia, you have a nine point five now.

37:25.680 --> 37:29.080
Um, well...
I'd also like to file a complaint.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.920
I've already decided.
No need to go over it.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.480
I'm very sorry.

37:35.640 --> 37:38.080
Besides, being second in your class
is no tragedy.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.840
Let's continue...

37:41.320 --> 37:43.520
What happened
on the afternoon of April 12, 2016?

37:43.600 --> 37:45.280
And don't say you don't remember.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.560
An incident took place.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.240
A fight.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.160
From what I know,
this was more of a beating.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.880
Who was involved?

37:58.000 --> 37:58.840
Pablo...

37:59.960 --> 38:01.640
and other students from the school.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.320
And why say nothing until now?

38:04.760 --> 38:05.600
Because...

38:08.160 --> 38:10.040
one of those students is my son.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.720
Hey.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.680
I'm sorry about last night, man.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.120
I got to the party,
but saw you with other people...

38:29.200 --> 38:30.560
I got bored and left.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.840
-Don't you get tired of lying?
-What?

38:45.080 --> 38:48.360
Do you think at this point
anybody cares if you are into guys?

38:53.200 --> 38:57.680
-No.
-Ah. Then why are you acting so weird?

38:58.560 --> 38:59.840
Why are you avoiding us?

39:02.080 --> 39:03.880
Why the fuck are you using?

39:12.640 --> 39:13.600
Ander!

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
-Calm down.
-Let go of me!

39:16.400 --> 39:17.880
-Easy. Look at me.
-It doesn't hurt!

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
It doesn't hurt, Guzmán! Let go of me.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.080
Look at me! Calm down.

39:21.160 --> 39:24.560
Do you think you're the only one I lie to?
I've been lying for years!

39:24.640 --> 39:27.480
-I have a lot of practice!
-What are you talking about?

39:27.720 --> 39:31.320
Ander, the tennis player.
It feels like my fucking last name!

39:31.560 --> 39:33.120
Well, I don't like it!

39:33.400 --> 39:35.120
You know? I don't like it one bit.

39:41.840 --> 39:42.880
Why don't you quit?

39:43.480 --> 39:46.200
What about my parents?
All the money they've spent on me.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.840
All those years of sacrifice, for nothing.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.360
I don't know where he is.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.640
A neighbor saw him leaving this morning.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.240
Suitcases and all.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.120
Bad luck for us, huh?

40:13.520 --> 40:15.000
And good luck for you.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.920
I tried, but...

40:17.600 --> 40:18.520
Oh, well.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.080
Come on.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.840
Don't worry. We'll see if we can find him.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.160
Damn.

40:39.640 --> 40:40.880
Boy, are we good!

40:46.600 --> 40:48.600
Was it that hard
to do what was asked of you?

40:48.880 --> 40:49.800
No.

40:50.240 --> 40:53.760
Do you know what this will cost you now?
Another 20,000 bucks.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.520
If you raise my debt,
how do you expect me to pay?

40:56.600 --> 40:58.200
I'm not here to give you advice.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.240
I'm here to give you a warning.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.600
The last one.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.320
Press the button.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.040
Press it, and travel to whenever you want.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.880
Shall I walk you home?

41:40.640 --> 41:42.960
-OK.
-Give me five minutes.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.120
Shit.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.560
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. Where are my mom and Samu?

42:05.640 --> 42:08.160
She's at work. Samu's in the bathroom.
Should I get him?

42:08.440 --> 42:10.440
No, they'll ask questions. Help me up.

42:10.520 --> 42:12.040
OK, come on.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.240
-Shit.
-Come on.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.920
Come on.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.280
Let's see.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.760
-Shit! You have to go to a hospital.
-No.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.320
This is just a warning cut.
Maybe next time.

42:31.400 --> 42:33.160
You have to tell them who did this.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.400
No. They did this
because I owe 40,000 bucks.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.960
You got stabbed
for owing a measly 40,000 euros?

42:41.040 --> 42:42.840
Look, in the real world...

42:43.640 --> 42:45.560
people kill for less, you know?

42:45.840 --> 42:47.960
Even if it's small change to you.

42:48.960 --> 42:52.640
I don't know. There must be a way
to get that fucking money.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.240
I'm going to help you.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.560
How?

43:03.480 --> 43:06.280
For now, I'm happy
if you don't tell my brother, OK?

43:09.280 --> 43:10.120
What's going on?

43:10.480 --> 43:11.920
Nothing, a couple of...

43:12.400 --> 43:14.880
beers too many, and they went to my head.

43:15.240 --> 43:17.320
Let's go, he's a little drunk.

43:17.400 --> 43:18.240
Yeah.

43:22.120 --> 43:22.960
Let's go.

43:31.280 --> 43:34.160
Nothing.
Nothing has been published anywhere.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.000
There's no news in the papers anymore.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.880
It's all YouTube clips...

43:39.200 --> 43:41.120
-and fucking gossip.
-Well.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.880
Don't worry, you did what you could.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.360
I did, unlike other people.

43:48.800 --> 43:49.960
What did I do now?

43:50.440 --> 43:52.280
The scene you made over your boyfriend?

43:53.160 --> 43:54.200
He's a child.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.320
Who's not ready to...

43:57.840 --> 44:00.120
Who's not ready
to be in a relationship with you.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.440
He knows, Mom.

44:03.800 --> 44:04.800
And he doesn't care.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.360
He doesn't care how I got infected.
Or who I did it with.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.520
Or what stupid things I've done.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.680
Because he doesn't look at me
as if I had the plague.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.640
The way you do.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.760
Do you have complaints about us?

44:19.920 --> 44:24.160
About how we deal with all the problems
you bring us, day in and day out?

44:25.120 --> 44:27.520
All the ways you've found
to fuck with our lives?

44:28.240 --> 44:30.160
Why don't you leave her alone?

44:32.600 --> 44:34.520
I did not expect this from you, Guzmán.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.480
People can surprise you.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.600
I haven't seen her smile like this
in a long time.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.880
So if she's happy with him,
it's not the end of the world.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.960
That afternoon, you, Polo, and Guzmán
waited for Pablo to leave class.

45:04.240 --> 45:06.320
But that has no bearing
on what has happened.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.640
Was Guzmán very angry?

45:10.160 --> 45:12.400
He had just found out
that guy had infected his sister.

45:12.480 --> 45:13.560
What did you do to him?

45:13.880 --> 45:14.800
Hey, Pablito.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.520
He got a couple of punches.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.560
Guzmán found out
his sister was about to run away

45:21.640 --> 45:24.600
with a boy who had impregnated her,
a boy like Pablo.

45:24.880 --> 45:26.880
What if he confronted her
in a fit of rage and killed her?

45:27.720 --> 45:30.240
He says he's incapable
of doing something like that.

45:30.600 --> 45:31.800
That he barely touched Pablo.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.440
Tell me the truth.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.320
Is that true?

45:45.560 --> 45:46.400
Guzmán!

45:46.880 --> 45:47.800
It's true.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.320
He barely touched him.

47:12.680 --> 47:15.440
