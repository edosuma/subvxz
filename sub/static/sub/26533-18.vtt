WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.394
Previously onCharmed...Niko's investigating

00:03.438 --> 00:05.048
the Sarcana, so if
she's digging into something,

00:05.092 --> 00:07.529
it's better if
I know about it.

00:07.572 --> 00:08.530
There's a war brewing.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.575
Sides are being drawn.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.142
You're supposed to understand.
You're one of us.

00:12.186 --> 00:15.798
Maybe I'm not, and maybe this
isn't what I thought it was.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.321
ELDER SILVER:
Due to the serious
breach of trust,

00:17.365 --> 00:20.324
we simply cannot let you
continue as a Whitelighter.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.587
My body is in the process
of deteriorating.

00:22.631 --> 00:26.983
And given the average life
expectancy, I'm... I'm afraid.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.115
I want to save Harry's life.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.377
I'll bring him back
when he's well.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.727
I don't know when that will be.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.511
Oh, Harry.

00:33.555 --> 00:34.730
I know how to
help you now.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.297
He has to find some
agoraphobic shaman

00:36.340 --> 00:39.343
on an unchartered island
and prove he can face evil.

00:39.387 --> 00:40.649
I'm scared
you might get hurt.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.346
Yeah, I'm scared of
getting hurt, too,

00:42.390 --> 00:43.956
but it's worth it
to me to try,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.349
because I love you.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.670
Something is
haunting my room!Demon in the house!

02:28.713 --> 02:30.193
What do we do?We need The Book
of Shadows.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.456
Go!

02:38.245 --> 02:39.942
MEL:
Move, I got this.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.782
Not impressed, ladies.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.786
Not impressed at all.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.135
Who the hell are you?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.224
I'm Tessa. Your new
and improved Whitelighter.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.835
You're...our new Whitelighter?

03:03.879 --> 03:06.055
So this was a test?MACY: And you thought it

03:06.098 --> 03:07.230
necessary to scare
the crap out of us

03:07.274 --> 03:08.449
in the middle of the night?

03:08.492 --> 03:10.233
Pretty sure I heard Harry
kidnapped you

03:10.277 --> 03:11.191
and tied you to chairs

03:11.234 --> 03:12.714
when he introduced himself?

03:12.757 --> 03:14.237
Well, we had
a rocky start.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.412
But he learned to respect us.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.240
And who the hell are you,
coming in here

03:17.284 --> 03:20.287
criticizing him
when he... just died?

03:20.330 --> 03:22.463
Thanks to the Elders.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.029
MEL:
We miss him.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.249
Yeah. It's really hard
to believe he's gone.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.382
TESSA:
I'm sorry.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.862
When they stripped his powers,
I felt it.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.604
Whitelighters are all connected.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.302
Our powers are derived
from a single source.

03:35.345 --> 03:39.175
I felt his light...
extinguish.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.481
But it doesn't change
the fact that you three

03:40.524 --> 03:43.048
are sadly, sadly
underdeveloped as witches.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.354
Uh!Oh, wow.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.268
Excuse me?

03:45.312 --> 03:46.313
Harry spent a lot of time

03:46.356 --> 03:48.140
teaching you to believe

03:48.184 --> 03:50.055
in your sisterly bond
and not enough training you

03:50.099 --> 03:51.274
and enforcing the rules.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.406
The Elders sent me

03:52.449 --> 03:54.190
to change that.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.496
We're not just gonna
listen to you.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.454
One thing to know about me:

03:57.498 --> 03:59.326
I don't like interruptions.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.284
This is the nightmare version
of Harry's opening monologue.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.938
MACY:
At least he made his fun,

04:02.981 --> 04:04.592
and Shakespearean.You three seem

04:04.635 --> 04:07.247
blissfully unaware
of the apocalyptic consequences

04:07.290 --> 04:08.770
of your laissez-faire approach

04:08.813 --> 04:10.554
to this gig.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.295
Your entire purpose
is to fight the Source.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.429
So, sorry if I'm not super fun.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.561
Wait, the Source?
Has there been another sign

04:17.605 --> 04:19.389
of the prophecy?Hello?

04:19.433 --> 04:22.523
Charity killed all those Elders
right under our nose.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.221
"The movement's
great sages fall..."

04:25.265 --> 04:27.571
Not to mention a Vortex Viribus
just appeared under this house.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.444
These are all signs that
something's coming.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.272
"Something's coming"?
How conveniently vague.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.534
TESSA:
Let me be clear.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.971
I'm here to prepare you
for battle.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.581
Because things are about
to get really real.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.280
Which reminds me.
Your demon side?

04:40.323 --> 04:42.369
We will need to get rid
of that ASAP.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.805
Well, we think I can utilize...We?

04:43.848 --> 04:45.067
Who-Who's "we"?

04:45.110 --> 04:48.853
I discussed it with... Charity.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.333
TESSA:
Uh-huh. Exactly.

04:50.377 --> 04:53.423
So, yeah. No, we'll
be getting rid of that.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.077
In the meantime, you
need to be able to

04:55.120 --> 04:58.298
fight the Source without
relying on this Book.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.300
That means memorizing spells,
keeping an eye out

05:00.343 --> 05:02.345
for demon activity,
and... more pop quizzes.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.651
Just like this one.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.305
You've been snoozing
all semester,

05:05.348 --> 05:07.916
now it's time to cram
for the final exam.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.352
Mm.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.354
Ugh.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.183
Wow.

05:14.226 --> 05:17.012
Oh, I totally overslept.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.101
Me, too.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.407
I was up the rest
of the night

05:20.450 --> 05:21.886
waiting for
Anne Hathaway-from-hell's

05:21.930 --> 05:23.410
next psychotic
training exercise.

05:23.453 --> 05:24.846
Shh.

05:25.934 --> 05:26.935
Remember?

05:39.730 --> 05:41.384
We can't talk smack

05:41.428 --> 05:43.691
about the Elders
in the open anymore.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.475
We have to light the
Anti-Surveillance Candle first.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.172
Right.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.522
I hate all of this.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.350
MEL:
It's bad enough
we have to assume

05:50.393 --> 05:51.699
the Elders are watching
our every move,

05:51.742 --> 05:53.396
but now Regina George
is our Whitelighter?

05:53.440 --> 05:54.528
Regina George.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.356
Much better nickname.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.053
Anne Hathaway does not
deserve that.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.402
MACY:
She kept mentioning

05:59.446 --> 06:01.491
the Source.
The Elders must be worried.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.364
Or trying to manipulate us.We can't go on

06:04.407 --> 06:06.409
like this. Our fate is in
the hands of a group of people

06:06.453 --> 06:08.237
we know we can't trust.But we don't have

06:08.280 --> 06:09.586
enough power yet to get out
from under them.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.284
MAGGIE:
Uh...

06:12.328 --> 06:13.416
guys?

06:13.460 --> 06:15.375
What the hell is a bursar,

06:15.418 --> 06:17.289
and why does she want
to take $30,000

06:17.333 --> 06:18.552
from me?

06:19.509 --> 06:21.119
Oh... my God.

06:21.163 --> 06:24.122
I have to pay tuition.

06:24.166 --> 06:27.256
You two were faculty kids.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.519
So that's not an urban legend?

06:29.563 --> 06:30.694
Professors' kids

06:30.738 --> 06:32.348
get to go for free?MAGGIE: I'm screwed.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.655
$30,000?

06:34.698 --> 06:37.571
Oh, my.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.138
Galvin's back tonight.
His flight lands at 8:00.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.618
Aren't you excited to see him?

06:41.662 --> 06:43.490
Of course.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.405
It just means I have
to find a way to tell him

06:45.448 --> 06:46.710
I don't want to cure
my demon side.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.496
Oh.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.367
So that's, like, a done deal?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.543
Despite what
Regina George said?

06:53.587 --> 06:55.415
I feel like I can manage it.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.982
It's the reason we
defeated Medusa, and...

06:58.026 --> 06:59.549
found out who killed Mom.

06:59.593 --> 07:02.030
Any additional tools in our
arsenal could be helpful.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.771
It's time the Elders

07:03.814 --> 07:06.469
really understood
who has the power.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.605
Well... I'm gonna start
memorizing spells.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.259
Just in case.

07:14.303 --> 07:17.306
You know...
until Harry gets back.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.263
Yeah.

07:23.704 --> 07:24.835
We need to talk.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.620
Niko, you scared me.

07:26.663 --> 07:29.057
Why so jumpy?

07:29.100 --> 07:32.321
No reason.
I'm just at work, so...

07:32.364 --> 07:34.889
Where's your tattoo?

07:34.932 --> 07:38.196
It was temporary.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.676
Have you been to
the Sarcana lately?

07:39.720 --> 07:42.287
I'm not really
a member anymore.

07:42.331 --> 07:45.465
Uh, Jada and I broke up.Oh.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.467
I'm sorry.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.513
So I'm no longer a good source
for any Sarcana info.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.515
Why do you ask?

07:52.559 --> 07:54.256
Oh, they've just
been quiet lately.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.998
I considered going over to check
everything out in person.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.305
But maybe everything would be
magically wrapped up.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.919
I'm at work.
I don't need you

08:04.962 --> 08:07.312
showing up to interrogate me.That's not why I'm here.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.532
Greta and I rented out the place
for our bachelorette party.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.794
We're just picking
out the menu.

08:10.838 --> 08:11.926
Oh.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.888
You're the private event?Mm-hmm.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.760
I'm working that shift.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.153
Then I'll see you there.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.555
Hey, you.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.167
I can't believe
you're really here.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.908
It feels like years.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.388
Uh, wait.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.216
Um, is the candle lit?

08:41.259 --> 08:43.044
MEL:
We're good.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.480
We felt the need
for enhanced privacy.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.916
Especially for
topics like

08:45.960 --> 08:48.484
my human boyfriend going on
a dangerous magical quest.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.183
Nice magical
quest stubble.

08:52.227 --> 08:55.360
Uh, thanks.You're laughing.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.362
Does that mean
you're okay?

08:57.406 --> 09:00.409
Yeah, well, I mean, I
won't pretend it was easy,

09:00.452 --> 09:03.238
but it was worth it.

09:03.281 --> 09:06.546
You... are worth it.

09:08.591 --> 09:12.290
I'm sorry. I probably
need a shower.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.031
Being stuck
in the jungle

09:14.075 --> 09:15.424
was bad enough,

09:15.467 --> 09:17.295
add seven hours
in coach.Galvin!

09:17.339 --> 09:19.036
You're back! Hey. What's up?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.343
MAGGIE:
Ah! I can't believe it.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.000
What the hell is that?

09:29.786 --> 09:31.396
GALVIN:
I know that man.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.529
He was the customs agent
who checked me at the airport.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.406
Dead body on our table.And our new Whitelighter

09:41.450 --> 09:43.800
likes to show up unannounced.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.672
You can't be here.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.372
What was that?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.200
We have rats.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.245
So I see you got my message.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.377
MEL:
You sent this?!

09:55.420 --> 09:57.466
There was a demon attack.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.079
Why'd you cast a privacy spell?

10:02.123 --> 10:04.255
Because we...
we always assume

10:04.299 --> 10:06.040
demons are
monitoring us.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.607
So, yeah, we use it

10:07.650 --> 10:09.434
whenever we talk about
defeating the Source,

10:09.478 --> 10:11.349
which is exactly what
we were just doing.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.003
Oh. That's actually smart.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.266
Not so smart,
your failure to monitor

10:15.310 --> 10:17.660
demonic activity
in your zip code

10:17.704 --> 10:19.183
that got this man killed.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.620
So...

10:20.663 --> 10:22.056
what kind of demon did this?

10:23.231 --> 10:25.886
MACY: No marks or
lacerations aside from

10:25.929 --> 10:28.758
those dual punctures,
so a vampire.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.020
Nailed it.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.458
You've seen Twilight,
I'm sure.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.026
If he bolts upright
in the next 48 hours, stab him.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.898
You two need to go
find this vampire.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.683
And get a new coffee table.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.425
I hate Regina George.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.819
MACY:
Hey.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.603
Really sorry about that.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.127
Uh, so,
what can you tell us

10:50.171 --> 10:51.912
about the customs agent?

10:51.955 --> 10:54.523
Well, he... detained
me for a while.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.307
He questioned me about
the artifacts in my bag.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.397
Could I have...

10:59.441 --> 11:00.529
could I have brought
something back?

11:00.572 --> 11:02.966
That's what I'm thinking.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.620
Why do you even
have these?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.188
These are Yoruba instruments
to cure Macy's demon side.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.583
MACY:
Well, um...

11:11.627 --> 11:13.324
I think you should go home

11:13.368 --> 11:14.630
and take that shower.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.371
And, uh, and we'll look
at these.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.329
All right. Bet.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.201
And, um...

11:20.244 --> 11:23.160
I'll see you later, okay?Yeah.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.162
Bye.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.606
MACY:
These are the artifacts
Galvin brought back.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.740
MAMA ROZ:
Mm-hmm.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.699
These are Yoruba, child.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.352
Are they dangerous?

11:41.396 --> 11:43.877
Mama's gonna find out.
Show me again.

11:47.532 --> 11:48.925
The spirits need

11:48.969 --> 11:50.797
to speak over this.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.760
If this is what
I think it is,

11:57.804 --> 12:00.154
things are gonna get dark.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.895
I'll call you soon, baby.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.855
In the meantime, I'll
check nighttime police reports,

12:05.899 --> 12:08.336
see if our vampire
has struck anyone else.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.598
Good idea.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.783
Okay.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.133
Sun's almost down.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.831
Let's see if you move.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.532
Why do I have to watch you?

12:30.575 --> 12:33.187
Didn't even like Twilight.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.623
Okay.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.407
"Sumerian Shroud.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.627
"Traps an opponent
in the astral plane

12:38.670 --> 12:40.803
for 30 breaths."

12:47.070 --> 12:49.594
She can't seriously expect us
to memorize all these.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.788
I'm special.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.414
What... determines...

13:27.502 --> 13:30.331
...blackness?

13:36.728 --> 13:38.818
Ew, do we actually have rats?

14:13.548 --> 14:14.897
Ah!

14:19.510 --> 14:20.860
Ow!

14:20.903 --> 14:23.340
Harry!

14:25.734 --> 14:27.475
Tessa!

14:27.518 --> 14:29.999
What's up?

14:30.043 --> 14:32.523
Do you hear that?Hear what?

14:37.267 --> 14:39.487
It's gone.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.490
There was this weird scratching
noise and it was getting

14:42.533 --> 14:44.100
louder and louder like it was...

14:44.144 --> 14:45.885
coming from everywhere
and then I heard this,

14:45.928 --> 14:47.451
this voice calling out
in agony, but...

14:47.495 --> 14:48.670
I couldn't make
out the words.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.715
There's a dead man
in your house,

14:50.759 --> 14:52.369
you're an empath;
what you're hearing

14:52.413 --> 14:54.763
is probably coming from him.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.157
I didn't touch him.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.636
And he's dead.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.508
Are you saying
I'm hearing his soul?

15:00.551 --> 15:02.989
Bingo. When a body dies,
sometimes it takes a while

15:03.032 --> 15:04.599
for the soul to cross over.

15:04.642 --> 15:05.948
This incident was
your powers

15:05.992 --> 15:07.645
trying to expand...

15:07.689 --> 15:09.647
and you should have been able
to recognize that.

15:11.649 --> 15:12.955
I see what you mean.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.565
Keep trying
to hear the soul.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.219
He might be able to help
you track down this vampire.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.354
Thanks, Tessa.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.530
We left your artifacts
with Mama Roz.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.358
She's confident she'll know
which demon

15:24.401 --> 15:26.534
killed the customs agent
within a number of hours.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.492
Thank God for Mama Roz.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.930
We need to talk about that cure.Uh, we just have to wait

15:30.973 --> 15:33.584
for the full moon
tomorrow night.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.456
I've got the spells, the totems.
I'm ready.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.675
Problem is, I'm not.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.547
Are you scared?

15:41.375 --> 15:43.072
I-I promise, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.595
No, it isn't that.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.208
I don't want
to cure my darkness...

15:48.251 --> 15:49.861
anymore.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.386
I know before you left,

15:52.429 --> 15:54.823
I was desperate to, but...

15:54.866 --> 15:56.607
it's helped me save lives.

15:56.651 --> 15:59.349
Even find my
mom's killer.

16:01.395 --> 16:04.615
My demon side, it scares me...

16:06.617 --> 16:08.619
...but it's part of who I am.

16:10.665 --> 16:14.103
Well, if you don't want
to do the cure...

16:14.147 --> 16:15.496
we won't do it.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.629
Do you mean that?

16:18.673 --> 16:21.632
You didn't ask me to go
off on a quest for you.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.112
Matter of fact,

16:23.156 --> 16:26.202
you tried to convince me not to,
if I remember correctly.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.639
I don't deserve you.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.642
MACY:
Galvin wasn't mad.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.427
Not even for a second.But you didn't go

16:33.470 --> 16:36.038
back to his place
to thank him personally?

16:36.082 --> 16:38.040
That is for tomorrow night.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.520
We are having dinner

16:39.563 --> 16:41.696
under the full moon
instead of a ritual

16:41.739 --> 16:43.437
to cleanse me of my darkness.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.960
Tomato,
to-mah-to.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.657
Still waiting

16:46.701 --> 16:48.529
to hear that voice again.
Until we hear back from

16:48.572 --> 16:51.140
Mama Roz, I don't know how else
we're gonna find this vampire.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.750
I still can't
believe you asked

16:52.794 --> 16:55.666
Tessa for help.I was scared.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.538
And she's who
we're supposed to turn to,

16:57.581 --> 17:00.149
that's how this works.
Plus, she did help me.

17:00.193 --> 17:03.587
Sorry, I'm just super stressed
with everything that's going on.

17:03.631 --> 17:07.635
I'm going to bed.

17:07.678 --> 17:10.116
I have to work Niko and Greta's
bachelorette party tomorrow.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.595
Oh, right.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.380
Sorry.
It's friggin' awful.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.511
Yeah, night, Mel.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.252
Good night.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.565
You said you wanted

17:24.608 --> 17:26.697
to talk to me about something?Yeah.

17:27.785 --> 17:30.484
So, um...

17:30.527 --> 17:34.705
when I found out
that we share a dad...

17:34.749 --> 17:36.838
I was so caught up
dealing with that,

17:36.881 --> 17:38.405
I didn't even
process the fact

17:38.448 --> 17:42.191
that there's this
whole other... culture

17:42.235 --> 17:43.540
I belong to.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.803
Well, it's...
it's understandable.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.588
It's a lot to take in.

17:47.631 --> 17:51.200
The thing is,
for 18 years, I have...

17:51.244 --> 17:54.160
always checked the same box
on every form.

17:54.203 --> 17:57.076
And now, I'm...

17:57.119 --> 17:58.903
eligible for...

17:58.947 --> 18:01.167
all these scholarships
for black students.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.647
Uh, is it...

18:03.691 --> 18:05.867
I don't know, is it messed up
for me to apply?

18:05.910 --> 18:08.130
Our dad is black.

18:08.174 --> 18:11.090
Right.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.917
Well...

18:12.961 --> 18:15.355
there's a group
interview...

18:15.398 --> 18:17.922
for the scholarship tomorrow
at the Black Student Union.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.663
I don't know,
should I go?

18:19.707 --> 18:21.752
Do you want to go?

18:21.796 --> 18:24.320
I'm really just looking
for a clear,

18:24.364 --> 18:27.106
"Yeah, do it, Maggie,
no big deal."

18:27.149 --> 18:30.283
Or a, "You're the worst,
that money's not for you."

18:30.326 --> 18:32.937
You could never be the worst.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.592
Do I get to be considered a part

18:35.636 --> 18:37.725
of a culture
that I didn't grow up in?

18:37.768 --> 18:40.162
♪ Ooh...

18:40.206 --> 18:42.033
Hmm.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.123
You know, I would
struggle with that, too.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.647

I know what you want.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.891
Old woman,
you're confused.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.764
I just came to check in on Macy.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.505
Demon.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.855
You stay away from that girl.

19:24.424 --> 19:28.036
Lots of... wisdom
in a place like this.

19:35.826 --> 19:38.220
What does the witch

19:38.264 --> 19:39.439
know about Yoruba?

19:41.397 --> 19:43.225
What... does...

19:43.269 --> 19:44.313
she know?

19:47.447 --> 19:49.449
Nothing.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.364
She knows nothing.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.366
Good.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.521
So, I could have gone to
an HBCU, but it felt

20:18.565 --> 20:21.263
important to me to thrive
on a mostly white campus.

20:21.307 --> 20:24.397
Because my existence
in certain spaces is, after all,

20:24.440 --> 20:27.574
an act of resistance.MAGGIE:
Well, um...

20:27.617 --> 20:32.143
I actually just found out
that I'm, um...

20:32.187 --> 20:35.582
that, uh...
that my dad is-is black.

20:35.625 --> 20:40.413
And to be honest, I'm...
at somewhat of a crossroads.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.292
Ow.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.815
Maggie. You good?

20:51.859 --> 20:53.774
Yeah, I just...

21:19.103 --> 21:21.323
Are you all right?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.456
I went to a wedding once
the day after a breakup.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.327
It's no fun.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.373
Oh, no, I'm fine.

21:27.416 --> 21:31.333
Niko, babe.
Time for toasts.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.857

21:33.901 --> 21:35.294
I hate public speaking.

Mel. Psst.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.040
We need to talk.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.999
I heard that voice again

21:45.042 --> 21:46.609
at the BSU,
except this time it was

21:46.653 --> 21:48.219
louder and more desperate.

21:48.263 --> 21:51.005
And you weren't even at home.Exactly.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.572
Look, I know we don't trust
Regina George,

21:52.615 --> 21:54.095
but I don't know
what to do.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.662
And Mama Roz never
got back to us about

21:55.705 --> 21:57.272
whether or not Galvin's
artifacts are demonic, did she?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.578
Not yet.

21:58.621 --> 21:59.796
All right, let's go.
We'll figure out

21:59.840 --> 22:01.668
if the voices are from
a demon or a ghost

22:01.711 --> 22:03.322
or whatever it is.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.895
MAGGIE:
The lights are on,
but she didn't answer

22:11.939 --> 22:13.332
all three times we called.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.029
Something doesn't feel right.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.944
Mama Roz?

22:21.209 --> 22:24.952
Oh, God.

22:24.995 --> 22:27.215
She has the same puncture marks
as the customs agent.Whatever these artifacts

22:27.258 --> 22:29.173
summoned must have
come after her.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.740
Yeah, and it
destroyed any info

22:30.784 --> 22:32.742
that could have been remotely
helpful in tracking it down.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.268
Nice job finding the next victim
before I did.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.183
Would've been nice
if you'd gotten to her

22:39.227 --> 22:40.576
when she was still alive.We don't need your help.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.839
We got this.Wait. Tessa?

22:44.101 --> 22:47.366
What you said yesterday...

22:47.409 --> 22:49.237
about a soul lingering
after the body dies.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.327
Do you think I could still reach
Mama Roz's soul?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.198
Possibly. Try it.

22:54.242 --> 22:57.898
Your sister doesn't
mind my help.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.822
MAMA ROZ:
It's an Abiku!

23:08.865 --> 23:12.434
Take my dagger, find the lost
soul at the threshold.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.393
The Abiku seeks the threshold.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.876
Something called
an Abiku killed her.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.270
And Mama Roz said we need
to find the lost soul

23:22.313 --> 23:24.446
through a threshold.

23:24.490 --> 23:25.708
Where are you going?

23:25.752 --> 23:27.449
A door is a threshold, right?

23:27.493 --> 23:29.930
What if the voice I've been
hearing isthe lost soul?

23:29.973 --> 23:32.149
I mean, the first time
I heard it, I was home alone

23:32.193 --> 23:35.936
at twilight, which is...A figurative threshold
between day and night.

23:35.979 --> 23:39.330
Same thing at the BSU; I think
my powers want to expand.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.421
I just need to let them.

23:49.515 --> 23:52.431
GALVIN:
Maggie, help me!

23:52.474 --> 23:54.302
Oh, no.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.435
It's Galvin.

23:59.350 --> 24:02.136
I'm so glad you're home.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.880
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

24:13.190 --> 24:16.150
I love a full moon, the
threshold of the lunar cycle.

24:16.193 --> 24:20.197
I love it when
you talk nerdy to me.

24:22.678 --> 24:23.984
Let's go to the attic.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.116
We'll be able to see it
much better from up there.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.075
Oh, come on.
Spring has finally sprung.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.859
Let's-let's stay here.

24:29.903 --> 24:30.991
No, really, it'll be better.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.993
Oh, oh, you're hurting me.

24:33.036 --> 24:35.386
Let go. Galvin!

24:35.430 --> 24:36.649
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:39.216 --> 24:40.479
Busted.

24:46.572 --> 24:47.877
Your magic won't work
on me, witch.

24:47.921 --> 24:50.010
What did you do
with my boyfriend?Don't worry.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.577
I won't be in here for long.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.492
It's your body I really want.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.630
The lost soul is Galvin's.

25:01.674 --> 25:04.590
Mama Roz said to find her dagger
and save him.

25:04.633 --> 25:07.723
Galvin? Macy's human boyfriend?

25:07.767 --> 25:10.291
This says that "Yoruba demons
of the Abiku family

25:10.334 --> 25:13.207
are 'disease demons'
who move from host to host."

25:13.250 --> 25:17.428
The Abiku must have taken over
Galvin's body in the jungle.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.911
Found it.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.566
"But their taste for
a permanent host is specific.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.742
Abikus prefer to prey on
the souls of dead children."

25:26.786 --> 25:29.136
Galvin's a grown man.

25:29.179 --> 25:32.226
But Macy was stillborn.

25:32.269 --> 25:34.533
The Abiku is using Galvin
to get to Macy.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.581
Where are they?

25:47.763 --> 25:50.374
Oh, God... the woods.

26:26.933 --> 26:29.283
ABIKU:
Oh, Macy...

26:29.326 --> 26:32.460
Where are you?

26:32.503 --> 26:33.766
It's your boyfriend.

26:35.855 --> 26:36.899
Oh, my God...

26:46.866 --> 26:48.258
Oh...

26:50.783 --> 26:54.743
Oh, my God. Oh...

26:54.787 --> 26:56.658
Thank God.Don't get too excited.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.574
This won't last long.
It's really strong.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.749
No, no, no,
we-we can't use that,

27:00.793 --> 27:01.750
there's something
wrong with him.

27:01.794 --> 27:02.969
We know. It's an Abiku.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.492
A parasite demon.It possessed Galvin,

27:04.535 --> 27:05.754
and now it wants you.

27:05.798 --> 27:06.712
We got this from Mama Roz.

27:06.755 --> 27:07.800
This is how you destroy it.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.628
But won't that hurt him?We don't know.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.151
Oh, God...

27:17.200 --> 27:18.680
Stop wasting time and stab him!

27:18.724 --> 27:21.509
I can find you
another boyfriend.
MACY:
No.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.380
There is always another way.

27:23.424 --> 27:24.643
You said the demon was

27:24.686 --> 27:26.383
like a parasite.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.037
If that's how it operates,
then it can't survive

27:28.081 --> 27:29.778
without a living host.

27:29.822 --> 27:30.866
What are you saying?

27:30.910 --> 27:32.172
I think I can use my dark side.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.478
If I can telekinetically
stop his heart,

27:34.522 --> 27:35.915
the Abiku won't be able
to survive.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.613
Once it's out of his body,
I'll restart his heart.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.962
Tapping into the darkest part
of your magic

27:40.006 --> 27:41.660
is dangerous beyond measure.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.531
I know you would prefer
I just let him die,

27:43.574 --> 27:44.663
but I'm the Charmed One,
I will decide.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.318
Nig igi nu-gub-a
e-gar e-gar duma.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.802
Maggie, where did that
come from?
TESSA:
Let me out!

27:53.846 --> 27:55.674
MAGGIE:
I've been studying new spells.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.241
Hurry, it only last
30 breaths, whatever that means.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.852
Okay, now. Okay...

28:29.446 --> 28:32.145
Okay, Macy, it's done.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.973
Stop.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.672
MACY:
Okay.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.369
Now restart his heart.

28:50.424 --> 28:53.819
Oh, come on.
Oh, this has to work.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.472
Galvin, come on!

28:59.694 --> 29:01.827
Oh, God, what have I done?MAGGIE:
Wait!

29:18.365 --> 29:19.714
Galvin!

29:19.758 --> 29:20.802
Thank you.

29:23.718 --> 29:26.329
Macy!
Oh, my God!

29:37.776 --> 29:39.516
Why can't we get in?

29:41.997 --> 29:43.129
Orbing is a type
of Western magic.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.609
I can't penetrate
a Yoruba barrier.

29:45.653 --> 29:46.828
He must need her in the house

29:46.872 --> 29:48.308
for the ceremony
for some reason.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.397
Mama Roz said the Abiku
seeks the threshold.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.312
Maybe the attic?

29:52.355 --> 29:53.835
That's where Mom brought
Macy back to life.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.358
The threshold between
life and death.

29:57.883 --> 30:01.147
We have to get in.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.235
I got this.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.815
Come on.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.484
MEL:
Macy, we're coming.
MAGGIE:
Hold on.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.628
Oh, my God.

30:47.671 --> 30:49.891
Are you okay?U-Uh, I'm fine. W-Where'd he go?

30:49.935 --> 30:52.241
Well, how do we vanquish
what we can't see?

30:52.285 --> 30:54.243
I don't know,
but we need that dagger.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.245
Okay.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.856
What are you doing?The Abiku wants you,

30:57.899 --> 30:59.248
but it'll have
to get through me first.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.467
Now would be a really great time
for that dagger.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.685
I'm looking.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.210
I'm looking.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.909
Oh! Oh, my God, that hurts.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.737
Got it!
MAGGIE:
Hurry!

31:14.046 --> 31:16.178
Macy, extinguisher!

31:16.222 --> 31:17.571
Uh...

31:36.590 --> 31:39.114
Oh, my God.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.247
Hey.Yeah.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.118
Oh...

31:44.859 --> 31:47.122
TESSA:
You never should have
told him about magic.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.645
He sort of figured it out
on his own.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.647
And Harry should have
wiped his memory as soon

31:50.691 --> 31:52.171
as that happened.
MEL:
Harry didn't expect us

31:52.214 --> 31:53.476
to be robots.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.825
He let us have
personal lives,

31:54.869 --> 31:57.524
and he trusted us
to know how to manage them.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.395
I don't have a problem
with your relationships,

31:59.439 --> 32:01.310
unless they interfere
with your duty.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.051
This Galvin-Abiku
incident

32:03.095 --> 32:05.401
came with a body count.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.360
And this demon
side of yours?

32:07.403 --> 32:09.101
It's a ticking time bomb.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.233
So far, you've gotten
lucky, but given

32:11.277 --> 32:13.496
the right circumstances,
you will lose control of it,

32:13.540 --> 32:15.759
and we can't rely on luck in
the battle against the Source.

32:15.803 --> 32:19.589
Or, my demon side will be what
we need to fight the Source.

32:20.677 --> 32:23.332
Well, for now, I'll take care

32:23.376 --> 32:25.117
of this dead
customs agent.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.509
Now that we know
he's not gonna turn

32:26.553 --> 32:28.598
into a vampire.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.603
You're welcome.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.172
MACY:
I'm really sorry

32:37.216 --> 32:40.088
for everything
you've been through.

32:40.132 --> 32:42.482
All to save me.

32:42.525 --> 32:43.744
Well, w-we can
still do the cure.

32:43.787 --> 32:45.093
I just got to go back
to my apartment...

32:45.137 --> 32:46.747
N-No, Galvin, I...

32:48.227 --> 32:49.968
I'm not taking the cure.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.622
How could you not?

32:53.406 --> 32:55.364
That Abiku thing,
i-it made me...

32:55.408 --> 32:59.107
it made me kill people.

32:59.151 --> 33:02.371
Admit it, Macy,
even you were scared of me.

33:02.415 --> 33:07.072
Yes, I was, but that is how
I knew something was wrong

33:07.115 --> 33:09.900
on our date, because
you weren't yourself.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.424
It wasn't you,

33:11.467 --> 33:13.078
it was the demon.

33:13.121 --> 33:15.863
And yet, you want to keep
the demon inside of you.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.430
It's not the same.

33:17.473 --> 33:21.912
I can control it, and
Harry taught us...

33:21.956 --> 33:24.480
it is my actions,
not my nature, that defines me,

33:24.524 --> 33:26.221
and I believe that.

33:27.831 --> 33:31.444
Look, Macy, I know
that you are not evil.

33:31.487 --> 33:34.099
But something inside you is.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.798
You really feel that way?

33:37.841 --> 33:40.105
Macy, please.

33:43.151 --> 33:45.719
Tonight,
w-what I saw when you...

33:48.852 --> 33:51.072
I can't unsee it.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.596
Not if it's still there.

33:54.467 --> 33:57.687
So what are you saying?

33:58.732 --> 34:02.431
I'm saying I-I don't...

34:02.475 --> 34:06.914
I don't want anything to do
with any of this stuff.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.959
Ever again.

34:10.352 --> 34:14.617
But this stuff is...
is who I am.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.838
I know-- no, I know. I know.

34:17.881 --> 34:20.014
It's...

34:20.058 --> 34:22.669
I love you.

34:27.717 --> 34:31.025
I love you, too.

34:31.069 --> 34:36.074
But I guess there's other forces
out there that...

34:38.119 --> 34:40.295
...are more powerful than that.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.328
You okay?

35:13.372 --> 35:15.504
I don't know.

35:15.548 --> 35:18.333
Was Tessa right to call me
a ticking time bomb?

35:18.377 --> 35:19.552
No way.

35:19.595 --> 35:22.598
She's such a bitch.Galvin agrees with her.

35:22.642 --> 35:25.384
What if it's true? What...

35:25.427 --> 35:27.516
What if I can't control it?

35:29.605 --> 35:31.825
Oh, it's... Niko.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.609
Do you mind?

35:33.653 --> 35:35.611
Go ahead.
Okay.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.571
♪ It's so easy
when you try at all... ♪

35:38.614 --> 35:41.443
Hey, uh,

35:41.487 --> 35:44.403
I know you're
feeling in between

35:44.446 --> 35:48.624
the witch and demon of
it all right now, but...

35:48.668 --> 35:51.192
I want you to know that
the goodness inside you

35:51.236 --> 35:53.760
isn't going anywhere.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.980
And feeling split between
two parts of yourself

35:57.024 --> 35:59.548
doesn't make you any less-than.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.685
Thanks.

36:07.295 --> 36:10.733
I wish you'd be just
as kind to yourself.

36:11.778 --> 36:14.128
What do you mean?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.565
With the
scholarship thing.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.655
I know it's all new for you,
and it's probably gonna

36:19.699 --> 36:22.223
take some time
to figure it out, but...

36:22.267 --> 36:27.097
whenever you want
to talk about it, I'm here.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.535
Thank you.

36:31.145 --> 36:33.582
But I don't think
I'm gonna apply

36:33.626 --> 36:36.150
for any of the black
student scholarships.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.676
It just doesn't
feel right.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.245
But I am gonna check
out the BSU again.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.768
Even though I...

36:45.812 --> 36:49.250
totally embarrassed myself
last time I was there.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.599
Oh...

36:50.643 --> 36:52.384
♪ To dream...

36:52.427 --> 36:54.908
I want to figure out
this new part of myself.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.563
I'm excited for you.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.826
Come here.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.828
Hmm...

37:04.526 --> 37:06.485
Mel, this place
has been ransacked.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.269
What's really going on?

37:08.313 --> 37:09.618
I don't know.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.620
I told you,
I'm not a Sarcana anymore.

37:11.664 --> 37:12.752
I don't believe you.

37:12.795 --> 37:14.275
I overheard you
at my bachelorette party

37:14.319 --> 37:16.016
talking about
demons and ghosts.Shh...

37:16.059 --> 37:17.844
I've been
in multiple situations with you

37:17.887 --> 37:21.282
where reality
feels altered, somehow,

37:21.326 --> 37:23.371
by you.Keep your voice down.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.199
Why should I trust you?

37:25.243 --> 37:27.201
Tell me the truth.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.421
You're hiding something from me.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.728
You're right.

37:33.860 --> 37:37.124
And I'm not going to anymore.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.259
I'm a witch.

37:43.304 --> 37:47.265
Did you just do a spell?

37:47.308 --> 37:49.049
Is this a coven?

37:49.092 --> 37:53.575
I will tell you everything,
but right now, you have to go.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.622
No. No way. I-I want to know
what this all means.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.101
Niko, look around.

37:58.145 --> 38:00.495
Whatever was here
may come back.

38:00.539 --> 38:03.063
I need you to go, now.

Oh, God. Jada...

38:49.152 --> 38:50.980
Thank God.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.025
Oh, you're alive.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.203
Who did this?

38:56.246 --> 39:00.816
Fiona. She's...
she's lost her mind.

39:00.860 --> 39:01.991
I think I survived
her power surge

39:02.035 --> 39:03.776
because
I'm half Whitelighter, I...

39:03.819 --> 39:05.125
Why would she do this?

39:05.168 --> 39:06.169
I don't know.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.910
And Mel, she has Harry.

39:07.954 --> 39:09.477
Is he okay?

39:09.521 --> 39:12.306
He looked
like his old self. Uh...

39:12.350 --> 39:14.743
It looked like Fiona
had him against his will.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.702
Oh, no.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.181
Mel,

39:18.225 --> 39:20.706
I think this is it.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.927
The prophecy.
I think it's a sign.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.453
Right.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.280
"With the blossoming of death

39:30.324 --> 39:32.544
brings the rise
of the Source of All Evil."

39:34.241 --> 39:37.113
I'm gonna get the hell
out of town before she finds me.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.593
You and your sisters
should, too.

39:38.637 --> 39:42.902
No. We can't.
We have to stay and fight.

39:42.945 --> 39:45.470
Be careful.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.341
Fiona is one

39:47.385 --> 39:49.169
of the only witches alive
that can match

39:49.212 --> 39:51.040
the Charmed Ones' powers.

40:22.811 --> 40:25.248
Harry.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.294
MAGGIE:
What if he left it

40:27.337 --> 40:28.338
for us?

40:28.382 --> 40:29.514
Like a...

40:29.557 --> 40:32.560
bougie British breadcrumb
to follow.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.083
Remember what Tessa said.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.651
All Whitelighters are connected
by their magic.

40:36.695 --> 40:39.262
We don't have to trust her.
We use her

40:39.306 --> 40:40.350
to help us find Harry,
the same way

40:40.394 --> 40:41.830
the Elders have been using us.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.093
They've taught us their game.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.226
Now it's time
we beat them at it.
