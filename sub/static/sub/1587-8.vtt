WEBVTT

02:15.219 --> 02:17.513
Here we are.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.939
Ready?

02:32.277 --> 02:34.238
The Rains of Castamere.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.156
You fucking deaf?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.742
Same wrong guess every fucking time.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.369
Listen, you cunt.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.037
Oh!

02:45.165 --> 02:47.251
The Bear and the Maiden Fair.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.838
- Yes!
- There's a man with an ear.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.674
Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.

02:55.425 --> 02:59.096
First time I saw you with your breeches down,
I thought you were a eunuch.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.515
You've seen it, girls.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.643
Like a baby snail peeking out of its shell.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.951
Your baby was crying this morning.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.292
Woke me up.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.587
- You hear me?
- Yes.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.715
Well, got anything to say?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.758
I'm sorry.

03:36.842 --> 03:40.679
I don't care if you're sorry.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.224
Keep that baby quiet, or I will.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.226
Don't you ever touch him.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.272
Little wildling bitch.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.400
You should have stayed with your own kind.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.280
- Are you listening to me?
- Shut your mouth.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.781
What?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.161
It's just an owl, you dumb bitch.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.746
No, it's not.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.763
Shh.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.064
I should never have left her there.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.651
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.362
They've been raiding the villages close by.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.907
And we just cower in here
while they slaughter our brothers.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.992
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.076
So it's all right, then?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.663
Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped
to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?

06:11.747 --> 06:15.042
I didn't say it was all right.
I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.085
We're pledged to guard the realms of men.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.587
She's dead because of me.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.172
We can't even guard Mole's Town.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.216
We can't go after them. You know that.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.342
It's what they want.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.761
And little Sam.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.847
As if I cut their throats myself.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.265
Maybe she managed to hide herself.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.226
I thought all of you was dead.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.603
You went up north with Mormont
and no one came back.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.647
Not for ages.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.273
But then you did.

06:40.025 --> 06:44.238
She survived Craster,
and he was the worst shit I've ever met.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.198
She survived the long march to the Wall.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.701
She survived a White Walker, for fuck's sake.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.454
She might have got out.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.167
She might have.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.505
If they hit Mole's Town,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.507
then we're next.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.262
Mance and his army must be close.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.680
100,000 of them.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.307
And there's what, 105 of us left?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.935
You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully?

07:16.395 --> 07:18.146
102.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.275
How do 102 men stop 100,000?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.905
Whoever dies last,

07:26.989 --> 07:30.409
be a good lad and burn the rest of us.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.120
Once I'm done with this world,

07:33.745 --> 07:35.372
I don't want to come back.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.602
You think he was spying on you?

08:38.685 --> 08:40.187
No, not spying.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.732
The Dothraki think outsiders are
ridiculous taking shame in the naked body.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.985
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.989
Yes, Your Grace.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.325
But you are not Dothraki.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.577
No.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.372
Well, I don't see why it matters.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.832
Grey Worm isn't interested.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.167
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.631
He was interested.

09:08.507 --> 09:09.800
What?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.638
I believe he was interested.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.310
When the slavers castrate the boys,
do they take all of it?

09:21.395 --> 09:23.146
All of it?

09:25.023 --> 09:27.609
The pillar and the stones.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.489
I don't know, Your Grace.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.825
Haven't you ever wondered?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.914
Yes, Your Grace.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.142
Missandei.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.815
I have come to apologise.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.067
You don't need to apologise.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.862
I hope I didn't frighten you.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.072
No.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.869
The lessons you give I in Common Tongue,

10:21.121 --> 10:23.790
these are precious to I.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.001
- "To me."
- To me.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.795
I don't remember
teaching you the word "precious".

10:28.879 --> 10:31.965
Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...

10:32.049 --> 10:34.551
He teaches me this word.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.514
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.974
I remember nothing.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.310
Only Unsullied.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.395
When they cut you,

10:46.271 --> 10:47.523
do you remember that?

10:50.108 --> 10:51.985
I'm sorry.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.113
- I'm sorry they did that to you.
- Why?

10:56.031 --> 10:57.241
Why sorry?

10:57.324 --> 11:00.035
It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.751
If the Masters never cut me,

11:07.835 --> 11:09.419
I never am Unsullied.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.923
I never stand in the Plaza of Pride

11:13.006 --> 11:16.385
when Daenerys Stormborn orders us
to kill the Masters.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.014
I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.

11:21.265 --> 11:25.853
I never meet Missandei
from the island of Naath.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.538
I am sorry I...

11:45.956 --> 11:47.583
For today,

11:48.625 --> 11:50.210
I am sorry.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.595
Grey Worm.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.811
I'm glad you saw me.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.857
So am I.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.424
Kraken.

12:37.966 --> 12:41.678
Mmm. Strong, as long as they're in the sea.

12:41.762 --> 12:45.098
When you take them out of the water,
no bones.

12:45.599 --> 12:50.270
They collapse under their proud weight
and slump into a heap of nothing.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.356
You'd think they'd know that.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.108
Unfortunately, they're not very bright.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.361
What do you tell them?

12:58.654 --> 13:00.948
I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon,

13:02.032 --> 13:03.283
heir to the Iron Islands.

13:03.534 --> 13:06.578
- And what are you really?
- I'm Reek.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.039
Are you sure?

13:09.540 --> 13:12.251
You do look very much like a lord.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.587
Formidable, proud.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.257
I'm Reek.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.050
Until when?

13:20.801 --> 13:22.636
Always.

13:22.719 --> 13:23.887
- Forever.
- That's right.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.724
Until you're rotting in the ground.

13:31.228 --> 13:35.357
Remember what you are and what you're not.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.734
Bring me Moat Cailin.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.057
No closer.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.520
Who are you?

14:52.309 --> 14:54.645
I'm Kenning,

14:54.728 --> 14:57.231
commander of this garrison.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.400
And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?

15:00.776 --> 15:02.152
Yes.

15:03.487 --> 15:06.073
And why should I believe that?

15:06.156 --> 15:07.991
I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.245
His third and last living son.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.080
I am your prince.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.290
I swear it by the Drowned God.

15:15.374 --> 15:17.584
What is dead may never die.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.586
What is dead may never die.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.214
And if you were my prince,

15:22.297 --> 15:24.258
why are you marching with a Bolton army?

15:24.341 --> 15:27.344
Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.348
He sent me to treat with you in good faith
as your fellow ironborn.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.141
And what does Lord Bolton want?

15:36.395 --> 15:38.397
You are fading from sickness,

15:38.480 --> 15:41.900
you are badly outnumbered,
and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.152
Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men

15:44.236 --> 15:47.948
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

15:48.031 --> 15:52.995
Do this, and he will be just and fair with you
as he has been with me.

15:54.913 --> 15:58.208
The Boltons will give you
safe passage to the Stony Shore.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.627
He wants us to surrender?

16:00.711 --> 16:03.714
My own father, your king,

16:03.797 --> 16:06.633
surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.136
I watched him bend the knee.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.345
There was no shame there.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.390
He fought with honour, as did you.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.521
"No shame."
"Fought with honour."

16:19.605 --> 16:21.106
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.695
"No shame." "Fought with honour."

16:30.073 --> 16:32.326
Only a whipped dog would speak this way.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.038
Or a woman.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.917
Are you a woman, boy?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.335
You don't know...

16:41.418 --> 16:43.337
The ironborn will not surrender.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.255
My name is Reek...

16:45.339 --> 16:49.635
You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy,

16:49.718 --> 16:51.678
or whoever the fuck you are.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.514
Reek.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.933
- What in the hell are you muttering?
- Reek.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.811
Reek.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.695
If we yield, we live?

17:08.779 --> 17:11.448
- Is that what it says on this paper here?
- Yes.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.117
Have your men raise the white flag
and open the gates.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.247
You're going home.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.630
You didn't really think
I'd let them go, did you?

17:27.297 --> 17:30.509
It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.636
Sad, but true.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.721
Traditions are important.

17:35.389 --> 17:37.641
Where are we without our history? Eh?

17:38.433 --> 17:39.810
Yes, my lord.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.688
Will we go home now?

17:43.355 --> 17:45.274
I believe we will.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.317
To our new home.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.497
You have foreign blood,
don't you, Baelish?

18:00.581 --> 18:04.084
A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.

18:04.668 --> 18:08.839
I suppose all of our ancestors
came from somewhere else originally.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.426
Our forebears settled the Vale
thousands of years ago.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.511
We've fought off invaders ever since.

18:14.595 --> 18:19.183
The beauty of the Vale is matched
only by the nobility of its great families.

18:19.266 --> 18:23.520
Lady Arryn often told me that
you were her rock, Lord Royce.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.732
She told me nothing about you, Baelish.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.151
But I didn't need to hear from her.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.028
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

18:31.153 --> 18:34.239
You've been licking
Tywin Lannister's boots so long,

18:34.323 --> 18:36.116
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord...

18:36.200 --> 18:40.412
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

18:40.496 --> 18:43.790
Always been a grubby job.
Why not let a grubby man do it?

18:44.333 --> 18:46.960
But when I heard you were lurking here,

18:47.044 --> 18:50.672
- fawning over the Lady Arryn...
- Lady Arryn invited me.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.383
She and I have been close since childhood.

18:53.467 --> 18:56.053
Yes, we all know how close you were.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.889
Lady Arryn's predilections
were her own affair.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.599
Her death is our affair.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.435
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.481
She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.

19:07.564 --> 19:08.732
But suicide?

19:09.107 --> 19:12.069
She adored that boy of hers.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.655
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.824
Strange that within days
of your arrival,

19:17.908 --> 19:19.868
you've married Lady Arryn

19:19.952 --> 19:22.162
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

19:22.246 --> 19:25.040
She was always prone to melancholy.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.126
My lady wasn't meant for a world
as brutal as ours.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.920
We were told there was a witness. A girl.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.089
A niece of yours, I believe.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.718
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.095
I assure you, she would be of no help.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.972
We'd like to speak with her.

19:42.558 --> 19:45.060
- Let me fetch her.
- No need.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.980
We prefer to
hear her testimony unadulterated.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.534
Come closer, child.

20:00.617 --> 20:04.538
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

20:04.621 --> 20:08.375
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?

20:08.458 --> 20:09.710
Your name is Alayne?

20:11.628 --> 20:15.048
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.550
- My lady...
- I wasn't asking you.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.676
He can stay.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.720
Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.804
Tell us what you saw.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.477
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.021
I have to tell the truth.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.320
I'll tell you everything.

20:36.403 --> 20:40.199
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

20:42.576 --> 20:45.329
My name is not Alayne.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.705
It's Sansa Stark,

20:47.164 --> 20:49.750
eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.

20:50.334 --> 20:52.419
Lord Royce,
we met when you came to Winterfell.

20:53.003 --> 20:56.089
You were escorting your son Ser Waymar
to the Wall.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.008
Sansa Stark?

20:59.176 --> 21:02.262
You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?

21:02.346 --> 21:05.182
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.020
All to protect me.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.315
Since my father was executed,

21:13.398 --> 21:16.443
I have been a hostage in King's Landing.

21:16.985 --> 21:20.822
A plaything for Joffrey to torture
or Queen Cersei to torment.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.117
They beat me, they humiliated me,

21:24.201 --> 21:26.370
they married me to the Imp.

21:27.538 --> 21:29.540
I had no friends in King's Landing,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.794
except one.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.302
He saved me.

21:42.386 --> 21:45.639
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

21:46.890 --> 21:52.062
He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie
with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.483
But the Lannisters have friends everywhere.

21:56.567 --> 21:57.943
Even the Vale.

21:58.026 --> 22:01.488
He made me swear
not to tell anyone my true name.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.240
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

22:03.615 --> 22:06.451
Your father grew up
right here in these halls.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.620
We hunted together many times.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.205
He was a fine man.

22:11.331 --> 22:14.126
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

22:16.962 --> 22:20.591
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.

22:20.674 --> 22:22.259
She was a troubled woman.

22:22.801 --> 22:26.221
She always loved Lord Baelish.
She told me herself.

22:26.722 --> 22:29.474
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

22:29.558 --> 22:33.270
a boy of eight
carrying everything he owned in a little sack.

22:34.313 --> 22:38.525
She confessed to me
she never loved Lord Arryn.

22:38.609 --> 22:42.029
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

22:42.779 --> 22:46.200
When the gods finally allowed her
to be with Lord Baelish,

22:46.283 --> 22:49.119
she was so happy. For a time.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.749
My aunt was a jealous lady.

22:54.917 --> 22:59.546
She was terrified that
Lord Baelish didn't love her any more.

22:59.630 --> 23:02.549
That he would abandon her
for a younger woman.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.971
And then,

23:08.055 --> 23:11.016
one day she saw him kiss me.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.351
Lady Sansa.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.854
It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce,
nothing more.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.317
Lord Baelish is my uncle now, by marriage.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.611
He's always been so kind to me.

23:22.694 --> 23:25.739
I was so happy to be here, to be free.

23:25.822 --> 23:26.865
All because of him.

23:27.783 --> 23:29.993
But my aunt turned on me.

23:30.077 --> 23:33.121
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

23:33.205 --> 23:36.416
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.546
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her,
she struck him.

23:40.629 --> 23:41.839
She said she didn't want to live any more.

23:41.922 --> 23:44.007
She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.

23:44.091 --> 23:45.926
He tried to reason with her,

23:46.009 --> 23:49.429
promised her
she was the only one he had ever loved,

23:49.513 --> 23:53.058
but she stepped through those doors
and she was...

23:58.605 --> 24:01.316
It's not your fault, sweet girl.

24:05.863 --> 24:09.241
It's not your fault.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.675
You could see it in the way
she raised that boy.

24:26.758 --> 24:29.678
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

24:29.761 --> 24:32.764
Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

24:32.848 --> 24:34.808
Apologies, my lady.

24:34.892 --> 24:38.145
And to you as well, Baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.

24:38.228 --> 24:42.024
You want justice, Lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.

24:42.107 --> 24:43.317
I want the same.

24:43.442 --> 24:48.030
Not much justice to be
meted out in suicide, is there?

24:48.113 --> 24:50.407
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

24:50.574 --> 24:52.659
Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale

24:52.743 --> 24:56.163
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

24:56.246 --> 24:59.666
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

24:59.750 --> 25:03.003
And since then, Arryn and Royce,
Corbray, Waynwood,

25:03.086 --> 25:06.215
all the great houses of the Vale
watched from the corner.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.717
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.386
Are you questioning our courage?

25:11.470 --> 25:14.014
I want to know which side you're on.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.975
Do you support the Lannisters, the house
that executed your friend Ned Stark?

25:17.059 --> 25:19.728
Of course we don't support
the damn Lannisters.

25:19.811 --> 25:22.940
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support, and Lysa refused.

25:23.774 --> 25:25.108
By staying out of the fray,

25:25.192 --> 25:29.238
you've allowed Tywin Lannister
to destroy his rivals on every compass point.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.781
Who stands against him now?

25:30.864 --> 25:33.408
Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?

25:33.492 --> 25:35.244
Robb Stark is dead.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.830
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

25:37.913 --> 25:39.289
Lord of the Vale.

25:39.373 --> 25:41.625
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

25:41.708 --> 25:45.003
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

25:45.087 --> 25:47.047
More often they die young.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.716
I adored Lysa with all my heart,

25:49.800 --> 25:53.887
but she loved her son so much
she became overprotective.

25:53.971 --> 25:57.599
He needs to learn how to swing a sword,
how to ride a horse.

25:57.683 --> 26:01.103
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes.

26:01.186 --> 26:05.274
Time for him to tour the Vale,
to visit all the castles in his domain.

26:05.357 --> 26:08.652
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

26:28.088 --> 26:29.840
Ser Barristan.

26:30.299 --> 26:31.675
Yes?

26:33.677 --> 26:35.012
Who sent you?

27:11.006 --> 27:13.050
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

27:14.218 --> 27:15.886
Have I forgotten a council meeting?

27:16.220 --> 27:17.513
No.

27:27.189 --> 27:28.690
What's this?

27:28.774 --> 27:31.902
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.585
You spied on her.

27:51.255 --> 27:52.256
Who gave you this?

27:52.965 --> 27:54.341
Does it matter?

28:03.934 --> 28:08.480
- Have you told her?
- I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man,

28:08.564 --> 28:10.691
rather than go behind your back.

28:14.027 --> 28:15.612
Let me speak with her in private.

28:15.696 --> 28:17.865
You'll never be alone with her again.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.987
Why did the usurper pardon you?

29:00.199 --> 29:01.700
If we could speak alone.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.870
No, speak to me here.

29:04.953 --> 29:06.788
Explain it to me.

29:06.872 --> 29:10.000
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?
Who profits?

29:10.834 --> 29:13.170
This is the work of Tywin Lannister.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.130
He wants to divide us.

29:15.214 --> 29:17.633
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

29:17.716 --> 29:20.594
The pardon was signed the year we met.

29:22.471 --> 29:23.722
Why were you pardoned?

29:23.805 --> 29:26.099
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

29:29.353 --> 29:30.604
It is not forged.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.606
Why, then?

29:32.689 --> 29:34.399
I sent letters to Varys,

29:34.483 --> 29:37.361
the spymaster of King's Landing.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.071
What was the content of these letters?

29:39.696 --> 29:41.573
- Information.
- What information?

29:42.324 --> 29:45.244
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.

29:45.327 --> 29:47.079
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.

29:47.371 --> 29:49.289
When you were married.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.208
When your brother died.

29:51.542 --> 29:53.627
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

29:54.211 --> 29:55.462
- I...
- Yes or no?

29:55.546 --> 29:56.630
- Khaleesi.
- Don't call me that.

29:56.713 --> 29:59.800
Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?

30:02.928 --> 30:03.971
Yes.

30:06.890 --> 30:10.519
That wine merchant tried to poison me
because of your information.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.312
I stopped you from drinking his wine.

30:12.396 --> 30:14.439
Because you knew it was poisoned.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.650
I suspected.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.402
You betrayed me

30:19.319 --> 30:21.321
from the first.

30:21.405 --> 30:23.240
Forgive me.

30:24.366 --> 30:25.617
I never meant...

30:26.910 --> 30:28.453
Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

30:28.537 --> 30:31.582
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

30:31.665 --> 30:33.750
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you,

30:33.834 --> 30:36.378
- fought for you, killed for you.
- ...and you want me to forgive you?

30:39.173 --> 30:40.507
I have loved you.

30:40.591 --> 30:42.259
Love?

30:43.260 --> 30:45.554
Love? How can you say that to me?

30:45.971 --> 30:48.515
Any other man,
and I would have you executed.

30:48.599 --> 30:51.685
But you,
I do not want you in my city dead or alive.

30:52.269 --> 30:56.899
Go back to your masters in King's Landing.
Collect your pardon, if you can.

31:01.236 --> 31:02.237
Daenerys, please.

31:02.321 --> 31:07.201
Don't ever presume to touch me again
or speak my name.

31:07.284 --> 31:10.120
You have until dusk to collect your things
and leave this city.

31:10.454 --> 31:13.582
If you're found in Meereen past break of day,

31:13.665 --> 31:16.126
I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay.

31:19.171 --> 31:20.756
Go.

31:22.216 --> 31:23.800
Now.

32:19.147 --> 32:22.025
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

32:28.866 --> 32:30.784
Walk with me.

32:30.951 --> 32:33.287
Has there been any word from Locke?

32:33.370 --> 32:34.788
No.

32:34.872 --> 32:38.709
Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy.

32:39.126 --> 32:41.712
None of the northern lords have seen them.

32:42.379 --> 32:44.464
Dead most likely.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.386
Most of the ironborn have fled the North.

32:49.469 --> 32:53.265
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.561
Tell me what you see.

33:00.397 --> 33:04.484
Moors, fields, hills.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.237
Tell me what you see.

33:12.159 --> 33:13.911
Nothing.

33:13.994 --> 33:16.914
Not nothing. The North.

33:17.831 --> 33:19.917
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

33:21.543 --> 33:23.462
400 miles that way.

33:24.171 --> 33:25.714
300 miles that way.

33:26.006 --> 33:29.635
The North is larger than
the other six kingdoms combined.

33:29.718 --> 33:32.054
And I am the Warden of the North.

33:32.137 --> 33:34.348
The North is mine.

33:36.266 --> 33:38.268
Now tell me, what is your name?

33:42.272 --> 33:44.066
Ramsay Snow.

33:44.399 --> 33:46.443
No, not Ramsay Snow.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.112
Open it.

33:50.113 --> 33:52.491
From this day until your last day,

33:52.574 --> 33:54.535
you are Ramsay Bolton,

33:54.618 --> 33:57.496
son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

34:03.919 --> 34:05.462
You honour me.

34:06.338 --> 34:09.675
I swear I will uphold your name
and your tradition.

34:11.218 --> 34:14.012
I will be worthy of you, Father,

34:14.096 --> 34:15.848
I promise.

34:34.366 --> 34:37.619
Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

35:06.356 --> 35:07.566
Yes?

35:21.580 --> 35:23.999
First time I saw you, you were just a child.

35:24.082 --> 35:27.085
A girl from the North
come to the capital for the first time.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.755
You're not a child any longer.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.094
Why did you help me?

35:36.178 --> 35:40.432
They would have thrown you through
the Moon Door if they found you guilty.

35:40.516 --> 35:42.893
That's not an answer.

35:45.354 --> 35:48.232
If they'd have executed you,
what would they have done with me?

35:49.691 --> 35:51.735
I don't know.

35:51.902 --> 35:53.737
Neither do I.

35:55.697 --> 35:59.034
Better to gamble on the man you know
than the strangers you don't?

36:01.328 --> 36:03.956
And you think you know me?

36:05.082 --> 36:08.377
- I know what you want.
- Do you?

36:24.059 --> 36:26.019
I thought it'd make me happy,

36:26.103 --> 36:28.105
but it doesn't. Not really.

36:28.188 --> 36:29.898
Nothing makes you happy.

36:29.982 --> 36:31.692
- Lots of things make me happy.
- Like what?

36:31.775 --> 36:33.402
Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

36:33.485 --> 36:37.072
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself,

36:37.156 --> 36:38.198
is that it?

36:38.282 --> 36:39.992
At least I could have
been there to watch.

36:40.075 --> 36:42.703
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

36:42.786 --> 36:46.165
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

36:47.124 --> 36:50.961
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?

36:51.044 --> 36:53.881
I wasn't the damn wine-taster.

36:55.507 --> 37:00.345
Little shit deserved to die, but poison...

37:00.429 --> 37:02.181
Poison's a woman's weapon.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.141
Men kill with steel.

37:04.224 --> 37:08.395
That's your stupid pride talking.
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

37:08.478 --> 37:11.356
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone
if I had to.

37:12.524 --> 37:15.777
I'd pay good money to see that.

37:18.906 --> 37:20.782
You should have let me burn it.

37:21.617 --> 37:23.452
It's a fleabite.

37:24.536 --> 37:27.581
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

37:27.664 --> 37:31.001
Well, we won't have to walk
too much further.

37:31.084 --> 37:32.669
You really think my aunt will pay for me?

37:32.753 --> 37:34.254
Aye.

37:34.338 --> 37:36.089
I've never even met her.

37:36.173 --> 37:39.343
Doesn't matter. You're her blood.

37:40.552 --> 37:43.055
Family, honour, all that horseshit.

37:43.764 --> 37:46.183
It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.477
I'm not a lady.

37:49.603 --> 37:51.188
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

37:52.231 --> 37:55.067
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

37:55.359 --> 37:56.944
And his

37:58.195 --> 38:00.531
travelling companion, Arya Stark,

38:00.864 --> 38:03.700
niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.

38:04.409 --> 38:06.495
Then I offer my condolences.

38:07.371 --> 38:08.455
Lady Arryn died.

38:12.376 --> 38:14.211
Three days ago.

38:32.229 --> 38:35.482
I've never left home before,
Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.

38:35.566 --> 38:36.817
You shouldn't be.

38:36.900 --> 38:40.070
The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie,
Mother said.

38:40.154 --> 38:42.156
It's not safe outside.

38:42.239 --> 38:43.699
It wasn't safe for her inside.

38:44.825 --> 38:47.703
People die at their dinner tables.

38:47.786 --> 38:49.580
They die in their beds.

38:49.663 --> 38:53.167
They die squatting over their chamber pots.

38:53.250 --> 38:55.419
Everybody dies sooner or later.

38:55.502 --> 38:57.588
Don't worry about your death.

38:58.463 --> 39:00.799
Worry about your life.

39:00.883 --> 39:04.928
Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.

39:05.262 --> 39:08.390
That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.

39:32.247 --> 39:34.124
Shall we go?

39:41.590 --> 39:44.009
Wine always helps.

39:45.636 --> 39:47.596
I thank you for it.

39:49.556 --> 39:51.517
Trial by combat.

39:52.601 --> 39:55.938
Deciding a man's guilt or innocence

39:56.021 --> 39:57.814
in the eyes of the gods

39:57.898 --> 40:01.151
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

40:01.235 --> 40:03.821
Tells you something about the gods.

40:05.906 --> 40:07.407
How much longer?

40:08.659 --> 40:09.993
Soon.

40:13.163 --> 40:14.706
Do you think Oberyn has a chance?

40:18.502 --> 40:19.795
The Red Viper of Dorne.

40:19.878 --> 40:22.130
You don't get a name like that
unless you're deadly, right?

40:22.214 --> 40:23.590
I've never seen him fight.

40:23.674 --> 40:26.385
Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

40:26.468 --> 40:29.930
- Oberyn believes in himself.
- That's putting it mildly.

40:31.014 --> 40:33.016
What's the punishment for regicide?

40:33.100 --> 40:35.978
Drawing and quartering? Hanging?

40:36.186 --> 40:38.438
- Breaking at the wheel?
- Beheading.

40:38.522 --> 40:40.107
Seems rather ordinary.

40:40.190 --> 40:42.442
And he was my nephew as well,
so what is that?

40:42.526 --> 40:46.321
Fratricide is brothers and filicide is sons.

40:47.823 --> 40:50.033
Nepoticide. That's the one.

40:52.703 --> 40:55.706
Matricide, patricide,

40:55.789 --> 40:58.542
infanticide, suicide.

40:59.376 --> 41:02.087
There's no kind of killing
that doesn't have its own word.

41:02.671 --> 41:05.799
- Cousins.
- You're right.

41:05.883 --> 41:08.135
There is no word for cousin-killing.

41:08.218 --> 41:09.970
Well done.

41:10.053 --> 41:12.306
Do you remember Cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

41:12.389 --> 41:15.851
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him
on his head and left him simple.

41:15.934 --> 41:17.519
Simple?

41:17.603 --> 41:21.023
Used to sit all day in the garden
crushing beetles with a rock.

41:25.235 --> 41:28.822
- Nothing made him happier.
- Nothing made you happier.

41:28.906 --> 41:30.449
You'd think being tormented from birth

41:30.532 --> 41:32.743
would have given you
some affinity for the afflicted.

41:32.826 --> 41:34.286
On the contrary.

41:34.369 --> 41:35.954
Laughing at another person's misery

41:36.038 --> 41:37.873
was the only thing that
made me feel like everyone else.

41:38.415 --> 41:42.169
- The joke wore thin, though.
- For you. You drifted away.

41:42.252 --> 41:43.420
I had other interests.

41:43.754 --> 41:45.464
Yes, other interests.

41:48.050 --> 41:50.761
- But I stayed with Orson.
- Why?

41:51.553 --> 41:53.055
I was curious.

41:53.722 --> 41:56.433
Why was he smashing all those beetles?
What did he get out of it?

41:57.309 --> 41:59.144
First thing I did was ask him.

41:59.478 --> 42:02.314
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

42:02.773 --> 42:04.525
He gave me an answer.

42:04.608 --> 42:07.444
"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em."

42:10.155 --> 42:11.824
I wasn't deterred.

42:11.907 --> 42:13.408
I was the smartest person I knew.

42:13.492 --> 42:15.786
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

42:15.869 --> 42:18.080
that lay at the heart of a moron.

42:18.455 --> 42:21.166
So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

42:21.250 --> 42:23.252
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

42:23.335 --> 42:25.796
Turns out, far too much
has been written about great men

42:25.879 --> 42:28.215
and not nearly enough about morons.

42:28.590 --> 42:30.634
Doesn't seem right.

42:30.717 --> 42:34.555
In any case, I found nothing that
illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction

42:34.638 --> 42:37.432
or the reason behind
his relentless beetle slaughter.

42:37.850 --> 42:40.018
So I went back to the source.

42:40.102 --> 42:41.937
I may not have been able to speak with Orson,

42:42.020 --> 42:44.731
but I could observe him, watch him

42:44.815 --> 42:46.900
the way men watch animals

42:46.984 --> 42:49.778
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behaviour.

42:52.656 --> 42:54.408
And as I watched,

42:54.491 --> 42:57.035
I became more and more sure of it.

42:57.119 --> 42:59.371
There was something happening there.

42:59.705 --> 43:02.416
His face was like the page of a book

43:02.499 --> 43:04.501
written in a language I didn't understand.

43:04.585 --> 43:07.337
But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.

43:07.838 --> 43:10.674
And I became possessed
with knowing what they were.

43:10.757 --> 43:13.427
I began to spend
inordinate amounts of time watching him.

43:15.053 --> 43:17.431
I would eat my lunch in the garden,

43:17.514 --> 43:19.183
chewing my mutton to the music of...

43:21.393 --> 43:24.229
And when I wasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

43:24.313 --> 43:26.356
Father droned on about the family legacy,

43:26.440 --> 43:28.317
and I thought about Orson's beetles.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.111
I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.

43:31.195 --> 43:33.113
Did I hear dragon wings? No.

43:33.197 --> 43:34.281
I heard...

43:36.408 --> 43:39.786
And I still couldn't figure out
why he was doing it.

43:39.870 --> 43:43.373
And I had to know, because it was horrible

43:43.457 --> 43:45.709
that all these beetles should be
dying for no reason.

43:45.792 --> 43:47.294
Every day around the world,

43:47.377 --> 43:51.089
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

43:51.173 --> 43:53.634
Who gives a dusty fuck about
a bunch of beetles?

43:53.717 --> 43:57.221
I know. But still it filled me with dread.

43:57.304 --> 43:59.973
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

44:00.057 --> 44:01.892
How many countless living, crawling things

44:01.975 --> 44:04.895
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

44:05.771 --> 44:07.814
In my dreams I found myself

44:07.898 --> 44:09.900
standing on a beach made of beetle husks

44:09.983 --> 44:12.402
stretching as far as the eye could see.

44:12.486 --> 44:17.074
I woke up crying,
weeping for their shattered little bodies.

44:17.157 --> 44:18.867
I tried to stop Orson once.

44:18.951 --> 44:20.118
He was twice your size.

44:20.202 --> 44:24.581
He just pushed me aside with a "cuhn"
and kept on smashing.

44:24.665 --> 44:26.124
Every day,

44:26.208 --> 44:29.086
until that mule kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

44:40.264 --> 44:42.015
So what do you think?

44:43.475 --> 44:45.602
Why did he do it?

44:45.894 --> 44:47.771
What was it all about?

44:51.191 --> 44:52.943
I don't know.

45:11.795 --> 45:13.714
Good luck today.

45:46.455 --> 45:48.332
Looks like very light armour.

45:48.415 --> 45:49.500
I like to move around.

45:49.666 --> 45:51.251
You could at least wear a helmet.

45:53.253 --> 45:55.130
You shouldn't drink before a fight.

45:55.214 --> 45:57.341
You learned this during
your years in the fighting pits?

45:58.008 --> 45:59.593
I always drink before a fight.

45:59.676 --> 46:02.346
It could get you killed. It could get me killed.

46:03.305 --> 46:05.182
Today is not the day I die.

46:12.856 --> 46:14.983
You're going to fight that?

46:15.067 --> 46:16.610
I'm going to kill that.

46:21.198 --> 46:22.574
He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

46:22.658 --> 46:25.619
Size does not matter
when you are flat on your back.

46:25.702 --> 46:27.246
Thank the gods.

46:29.540 --> 46:32.584
In the sight of gods and men,

46:32.751 --> 46:38.048
we gather to ascertain
the guilt or innocence of this...

46:39.174 --> 46:42.052
...man, Tyrion Lannister.

46:42.135 --> 46:44.179
May the Mother grant them mercy.

46:44.721 --> 46:48.642
May the Father give them
such justice as they deserve.

46:48.725 --> 46:51.979
And may the Warrior guide the hand
of our champion...

47:02.447 --> 47:04.408
Don't leave me alone in this world.

47:04.491 --> 47:06.243
Never.

47:27.014 --> 47:28.765
Have they told you who I am?

47:28.849 --> 47:29.933
Some dead man.

47:35.189 --> 47:37.816
I am the brother of Elia Martell.

47:38.525 --> 47:42.279
And do you know why I have come
all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city?

47:43.280 --> 47:44.573
For you.

47:49.661 --> 47:52.539
I'm going to hear you confess before you die.

47:52.831 --> 47:56.043
You raped my sister. You murdered her.

47:56.126 --> 47:57.794
You killed her children.

47:58.462 --> 48:00.881
Say it now, and we can make this quick.

48:08.805 --> 48:11.475
Say it. You raped her.

48:12.559 --> 48:13.685
You murdered her.

48:18.273 --> 48:19.441
You killed her children.

48:31.119 --> 48:35.082
You raped her! You murdered her!
You killed her children!

49:14.788 --> 49:16.623
You raped her!

49:16.707 --> 49:18.041
You murdered her!

49:27.801 --> 49:29.803
You killed her children!

49:37.561 --> 49:39.897
Wait. Are you dying?

49:39.980 --> 49:43.901
No. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed.

49:47.362 --> 49:48.780
Say it.

49:49.406 --> 49:52.993
Say her name. Elia Martell.

49:53.076 --> 49:55.621
You raped her. You killed her children.

49:55.704 --> 49:57.915
Elia Martell.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.625
Who gave you the order?

50:00.417 --> 50:02.336
Who gave you the order?

50:03.086 --> 50:04.129
Say her name!

50:04.421 --> 50:06.840
You raped her! You murdered her!

50:06.924 --> 50:09.051
You killed her children!

50:09.593 --> 50:11.428
Say her name.

50:13.388 --> 50:15.057
Say it!

50:22.439 --> 50:23.607
Elia Martell.

50:25.526 --> 50:27.110
I killed her children,

50:27.820 --> 50:28.987
then I raped her.

50:30.447 --> 50:33.116
Then I smashed her head in like this!

50:47.256 --> 50:48.966
The gods have made their will known.

50:50.217 --> 50:52.469
Tyrion Lannister,

50:52.553 --> 50:55.138
in the name of King Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

50:55.222 --> 50:57.349
First of His Name,

50:57.432 --> 50:59.184
you are hereby sentenced to death.
