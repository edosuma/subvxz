10:10.766 --> 10:13.766
PAPER A LOT.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.666
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

10:15.733 --> 10:16.700
TO POINT IT OUT BECAUSE THERE

10:16.766 --> 10:18.133
ARE SOME REALLY GOOD THINGS

10:18.200 --> 10:18.400
GOING ON.

10:18.466 --> 10:20.733
THE VACCINE GETTING OUT THE

10:20.800 --> 10:20.933
KIDS.

10:21.000 --> 10:21.933
>> Bill: THAT'S NOT A GOOD

10:22.000 --> 10:23.700
THING BUT LET'S MOVE ON FROM

10:23.766 --> 10:24.000
THERE.

10:24.066 --> 10:25.533
>> OF THE BOOSTER IS GETTING

10:25.600 --> 10:26.300
OUT.

10:26.366 --> 10:27.800
>> Bill: THAT'S NOT A GOOD

10:27.866 --> 10:30.466
THING EITHER, LET'S KEEP GOING.

10:30.533 --> 10:32.866
THE GOOD THING IS THAT COVID IS

10:32.933 --> 10:33.933
OVER.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.300
>> THEY SAY IN DULUTH, IT'S THE

10:35.366 --> 10:37.400
LIGHTHOUSE ON THE HORIZON.

10:37.466 --> 10:41.000
WE SEE IT, IT'S THERE, NOW IT'S

10:41.066 --> 10:42.433
TIME TO START WORKING ON WHAT

10:42.500 --> 10:44.733
REALLY MATTERS TO PEOPLE.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.833
>> Bill: HERE'S THE THING, I

10:46.900 --> 10:48.100
KNOW YOU WORKED A LOT ON

10:48.166 --> 10:49.533
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AS AN

10:49.600 --> 10:51.700
ISSUE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT

10:51.766 --> 10:52.766
BUT THE FIRST ONE, THE MERCK

10:52.833 --> 10:54.166
PILL WHICH I TALKED ABOUT ABOUT

10:54.233 --> 10:56.833
A MONTH AGO, NOW PFIZER HAS ONE

10:56.900 --> 10:59.733
OF THE MERCK ONE WE KNOW COSTS

10:59.800 --> 11:00.966
$17 AND THEN THEY ARE GOING TO

11:01.033 --> 11:05.666
CHARGE $700 FOR THE PILL.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.100
THIS IS THE ESSENCE, ONE OF THE

11:08.166 --> 11:09.433
ESSENCES OF OUR HEALTH CARE.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.533
THE GOUGING.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.100
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS DO SOMETHING

11:14.166 --> 11:14.566
ABOUT THAT?

11:14.633 --> 11:16.000
>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME, I

11:16.066 --> 11:17.533
WILL START WITH THE FACT THAT

11:17.600 --> 11:19.266
THERE ARE THREE LOBBYISTS FOR

11:19.333 --> 11:21.233
EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM

11:21.300 --> 11:22.800
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

11:22.866 --> 11:25.166
>> Bill: SO?

11:25.233 --> 11:26.900
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY

11:26.966 --> 11:28.766
THEY JUST SPENT GOING TO GET MY

11:28.833 --> 11:29.800
BILL TO ALLOW FOR NEGOTIATION OF

11:29.866 --> 11:34.933
PRICES UNDER MEDICARE,

11:35.000 --> 11:35.233
$28 MILLION.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.066
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT IT IS,

11:36.133 --> 11:37.233
PEOPLE ARE BOUGHT OFF.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.566
>> THEY ARE IN PEOPLE'S EARS,

11:39.633 --> 11:42.700
ONCE WE FINALLY GOT DONE, WE

11:42.766 --> 11:43.833
HAVE FINALLY STARTED NEGOTIATING

11:43.900 --> 11:46.733
PRICES UNDER MEDICARE.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.166
[APPLAUSE]

11:47.233 --> 11:49.366
I WANT YOU TO PICTURE THIS, YOU

11:49.433 --> 11:51.300
WOULD THINK THAT 46 MILLION

11:51.366 --> 11:53.166
SENIORS WOULD HAVE SOME

11:53.233 --> 11:54.166
BARGAINING POWER, YET OUR

11:54.233 --> 11:55.766
COUNTRY IS PAYING MORE FOR

11:55.833 --> 11:57.033
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAN ANY

11:57.100 --> 11:59.233
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, YET IT'S

11:59.300 --> 12:01.666
OUR TAXPAYERS THAT HAVE PAID FOR

12:01.733 --> 12:02.066
ALL OF THIS.

12:02.133 --> 12:03.533
>> Bill: JUST NEGOTIATING THE

12:03.600 --> 12:05.500
PRICES, WHICH IS SUCH AN EASY

12:05.566 --> 12:06.166
THING TO DO.

12:06.233 --> 12:09.100
IF YOU BUY IN BULK, WHAT IS

12:09.166 --> 12:09.333
COSTCO?

12:09.400 --> 12:10.533
IT'S THAT PRINCIPLE.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.966
IF YOU BUY IN BULK YOU GET A

12:12.033 --> 12:14.033
DISCOUNT WHICH WE DON'T DO ON

12:14.100 --> 12:17.000
THIS LEVEL AND I GOT TO SAY.

12:17.066 --> 12:19.566
THE MESSAGE, EVEN THE

12:19.633 --> 12:20.333
REPUBLICANS, MAYBE NOT THE

12:20.400 --> 12:21.533
POLITICIANS BUT REPUBLICAN

12:21.600 --> 12:22.833
VOTERS ARE FOR THIS.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.133
>> 90% OF PEOPLE ARE FOR AT.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.533
>> Bill: WHO WOULDN'T BE?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.466
ALL I HEARD WAS YOUR

12:30.533 --> 12:31.800
$3.5 TRILLION -- INSTEAD OF JUST

12:31.866 --> 12:33.000
BREAKING IT INTO PIECES AND

12:33.066 --> 12:34.766
SELLING THE THINGS THAT ARE

12:34.833 --> 12:36.900
POPULAR, PEOPLE THINK OF

12:36.966 --> 12:39.100
DEMOCRATS THIS YEAR, PROBABLY

12:39.166 --> 12:40.800
WHY BIDEN'S NUMBERS ARE SO LOW,

12:40.866 --> 12:41.633
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT IT COSTS AND

12:41.700 --> 12:46.066
DO SO LITTLE ABOUT WHAT IT DOES

12:46.133 --> 12:47.066
AND THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.066
WHY DIDN'T YOU SELL IT IN PIECES

12:48.133 --> 12:50.733
INSTEAD OF ONE GIANT?

12:50.800 --> 12:55.100
>> LET ME DO IT.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.000
POLITICS SHOULD BE ABOUT

12:56.066 --> 12:58.366
IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND

12:58.433 --> 12:58.966
THAT MEANS BRINGING COSTS DOWN

12:59.033 --> 13:01.766
FOR PEOPLE.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.933
I DON'T CARE IF YOUR DEMOCRAT OR

13:04.000 --> 13:05.066
REPUBLICAN, IT'S HARD TO AFFORD

13:05.133 --> 13:07.100
CHILD CARE OR EVEN FIND

13:07.166 --> 13:07.966
CHILD CARE FOR FAMILIES.

13:08.033 --> 13:09.566
YOU HAVE GOT FAMILIES THAT ARE

13:09.633 --> 13:12.566
IN SCHOOLS, OPEN AND CLOSED,

13:12.633 --> 13:14.300
GETTING A HOLD ON THIS PANDEMIC

13:14.366 --> 13:15.666
AND GETTING THROUGH IT TO.

13:15.733 --> 13:19.200
DRUGS SKYROCKETING, IF YOU TAKE

13:19.266 --> 13:21.766
LYRICA, IT'S GONE UP 50% OF THE

13:21.833 --> 13:22.766
LAST FIVE YEARS, INSULIN,

13:22.833 --> 13:24.533
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD COST

13:24.600 --> 13:26.200
HARDLY ANYTHING, SENIORS TAKING

13:26.266 --> 13:27.800
LITTLE DROPS IN VIALS AND

13:27.866 --> 13:28.700
SENDING THEM FROM DAY-TO-DAY

13:28.766 --> 13:30.000
BECAUSE IT COST TOO MUCH --

13:30.066 --> 13:31.400
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO HELP

13:31.466 --> 13:32.733
PEOPLE WITH THEIR GUILT THINGS

13:32.800 --> 13:34.133
THAT MATTER TO THEM.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.566
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS IN POLITICS.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.166
RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST GOTTEN TOO

13:38.233 --> 13:39.700
BOGGLED UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF

13:39.766 --> 13:41.100
THINGS AND PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT

13:41.166 --> 13:42.966
THIS AND THIS AND THIS, WE HAVE

13:43.033 --> 13:44.900
TO GET ON OUR WORK AND HELPING

13:44.966 --> 13:45.433
PEOPLE.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.566
>> Bill: YOU NEED A

13:46.633 --> 13:48.800
MESSAGING'S ARE YOUR PARTY.

13:48.866 --> 13:50.500
>> WE NEED A SIMPLE MESSAGE, YOU

13:50.566 --> 14:01.166
THINK IT SHOULD BE YOU M YOU?AK

14:01.233 --> 14:02.566
>> Bill: I DON'T WANT THAT JOB

14:02.633 --> 14:04.200
BUT I THINK I'VE DONE IT HERE,

14:04.266 --> 14:05.333
PLENTY AND THEY NEVER LISTEN TO

14:05.400 --> 14:07.666
ME, AND I'M ALWAYS RIGHT.

14:07.733 --> 14:10.333
[APPLAUSE]

14:10.400 --> 14:11.866
>> WE HAVE TO CONTRAST WITH WHAT

14:11.933 --> 14:13.900
THEY ARE DOING, THEY SAY WE ARE

14:13.966 --> 14:15.566
STANDING FOR FREEDOM BUT THEY

14:15.633 --> 14:16.866
ARE BLOCKING PEOPLE'S FREEDOM TO

14:16.933 --> 14:18.500
VOTE, WE ARE STANDING UP FOR

14:18.566 --> 14:19.266
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO VOTE.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.900
THEY SAY THEY ARE FOR FREEDOM

14:20.966 --> 14:22.233
BUT THEY ARE BLOCKING WOMEN'S

14:22.300 --> 14:22.966
RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

14:23.033 --> 14:24.733
THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE, WE ARE

14:24.800 --> 14:25.333
STANDING UP FOR THAT.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.700
THEY SAY THEY ARE FOR FAMILIES

14:26.766 --> 14:29.400
AND THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO

14:29.466 --> 14:30.566
BRING DOWN THE COST OF

14:30.633 --> 14:32.633
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR MAKE IT

14:32.700 --> 14:33.433
EASIER TO AFFORD CHILD CARE.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
>> Bill: THOSE ARGUMENTS ARE

14:34.566 --> 14:35.866
NEVER GOING TO WORK ON CERTAIN

14:35.933 --> 14:36.300
PEOPLE.

14:36.366 --> 14:38.900
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE CARE ABOUT

14:38.966 --> 14:39.133
FREEDOM.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.200
>> Bill: YOU MENTIONED THE

14:41.266 --> 14:42.733
ABORTION THING, OBVIOUSLY THE

14:42.800 --> 14:43.600
PEOPLE DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY AND

14:43.666 --> 14:46.300
THEY NEVER WILL.

14:46.366 --> 14:47.000
BECAUSE IT'S A TRICKY ISSUE.

14:47.066 --> 14:49.233
>> LET'S SEE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT

14:49.300 --> 14:51.333
IT IN TEXAS WHERE THEY PASSED A

14:51.400 --> 14:53.133
BILL TO MAKE PEOPLE VIGILANTES

14:53.200 --> 14:55.700
TO GO AFTER --

14:55.766 --> 14:57.433
>> Bill: THAT THERE ARE LIKE

14:57.500 --> 14:58.533
SIX STATES NOW WHERE THERE'S

14:58.600 --> 15:01.000
ONLY ONE ABORTION CLINIC.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.200
THIS IS WHAT THE REPUBLICANS

15:02.266 --> 15:05.033
ALSO DO SO WELL, THEY PLAY THE

15:05.100 --> 15:05.500
LONG GAME.

15:05.566 --> 15:12.666
THEY LOST ROLE ROE VS. WADE ANY

15:12.733 --> 15:14.200
SAID OKAY IT MIGHT TAKE US 50

15:14.266 --> 15:16.733
YEARS BUT WE ARE GOING TO ATTACK

15:16.800 --> 15:18.566
THIS AND ROE VS. WADE HAS BECOME

15:18.633 --> 15:19.433
ALMOST IRRELEVANT.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.666
IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE WITH ONE

15:21.733 --> 15:22.533
ABORTION CLINIC, DOESN'T THE

15:22.600 --> 15:23.133
DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEED A

15:23.200 --> 15:26.133
DIFFERENT STRATEGY ON THIS ISSU

15:26.200 --> 15:26.733
ISSUE?

15:26.800 --> 15:27.666
>> AGAIN, ON ALL STRATEGIES YOU

15:27.733 --> 15:30.466
HAVE TO PUT PEOPLE FIRST.

15:30.533 --> 15:32.500
SOMEHOW THAT HAS GOTTEN LOST IN

15:32.566 --> 15:33.733
ALL OF THE ARCHAIC SENATE RULES

15:33.800 --> 15:34.833
AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHO'S UP,

15:34.900 --> 15:37.366
WHO'S DOWN, THE STANDOFF YOU ARE

15:37.433 --> 15:39.700
SEEING RIGHT NOW AND WE NEED TO

15:39.766 --> 15:40.366
MOVE FORWARD.

15:40.433 --> 15:42.066
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET VOTERS WHO

15:42.133 --> 15:44.000
ARE REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENCE,

15:44.066 --> 15:44.666
MODERATE DEMOCRATS IN MY STATE

15:44.733 --> 15:46.566
AND A LOT OF THAT IS GETTING OUT

15:46.633 --> 15:48.900
OF LISTENING TO PEOPLE.

15:48.966 --> 15:50.533
WHEN YOU HAVE A KID IN RURAL

15:50.600 --> 15:51.933
MINNESOTA WHO'S GOT TO GO TO A

15:52.000 --> 15:53.966
LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT TO TAKE

15:54.033 --> 15:55.566
HER BIOLOGY TEST BECAUSE SHE

15:55.633 --> 15:56.933
DOESN'T HAVE BROADBAND, TRUE

15:57.000 --> 16:04.133
STORY, TALKS TO HER MOM -- JUST

16:04.200 --> 16:05.033
A TAKER TEST.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.133
>> Bill: I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN

16:06.200 --> 16:08.200
IT FOR HER IF I WOULD'VE BEEN

16:08.266 --> 16:08.933
THERE.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.433
LISTEN, WOULD YOU BUY ME SOME

16:10.500 --> 16:11.100
BEER?

16:11.166 --> 16:12.433
OF COURSE I WOULD, YOU'RE

16:12.500 --> 16:13.600
STUDYING FOR A TEST.

16:13.666 --> 16:15.300
>> THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE

16:15.366 --> 16:16.366
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, IT'S GOING

16:16.433 --> 16:17.666
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR

16:17.733 --> 16:18.066
LIVES.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.733
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO CONNECT

16:19.800 --> 16:20.400
IT UP TO.

16:20.466 --> 16:22.800
THERE ARE TOO MANY MOMS AND DADS

16:22.866 --> 16:24.300
WITH THEIR TODDLERS ON THEIR

16:24.366 --> 16:26.900
KNEES AND THEIR LAPTOPS ON THEIR

16:26.966 --> 16:27.400
DESK, TEACHING THEIR

16:27.466 --> 16:28.533
SECOND-GRADER HOW TO USE THE

16:28.600 --> 16:30.500
MUTE BUTTON WHICH THEY ARE

16:30.566 --> 16:31.633
BETTER THAN SENATORS, WE HAVE TO

16:31.700 --> 16:32.766
CONNECT TO THEIR REAL LIVES AND

16:32.833 --> 16:35.666
THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO DO IN MY

16:35.733 --> 16:36.133
WORK.

16:36.200 --> 16:40.666
[APPLAUSE]

16:40.733 --> 16:41.700
>> Bill: THE REASON WHY I

16:41.766 --> 16:43.133
THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD

16:43.200 --> 16:46.533
CANDIDATE LAST TIME, I

16:46.600 --> 16:46.833
REMEMBER --

16:46.900 --> 16:48.666
>> I DID A GOOD JOB.

16:48.733 --> 16:49.933
>> Bill: YOU CAME ON, YOU WENT

16:50.000 --> 16:56.200
UP THERE AND THEN BIDEN -- YOU

16:56.266 --> 16:57.800
ARE AN HONEST BROKER IN THE

16:57.866 --> 17:00.400
PARTY BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE

17:00.466 --> 17:03.766
WING AND THERE IS NO

17:03.833 --> 17:05.200
NONPROGRESSIVE WING IN THE

17:05.266 --> 17:05.966
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

17:06.033 --> 17:08.900
A COUPLE.

17:08.966 --> 17:10.866
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF MODERATES

17:10.933 --> 17:13.566
WHO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE IN THE

17:13.633 --> 17:14.133
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THERE ARE

17:14.200 --> 17:16.900
CERTAINLY MODERATES OUT THERE --

17:16.966 --> 17:18.366
>> Bill: MODERATE FOR THE

17:18.433 --> 17:19.500
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS PRETTY

17:19.566 --> 17:20.000
FAR LEFT.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.266
>> I FIGURE YOU JUST GOT TO DO

17:21.333 --> 17:23.166
YOUR WORK.

17:23.233 --> 17:25.133
TAKING ON THE TECH COMPANIES,

17:25.200 --> 17:26.366
I'M DOING THAT WITH LIBERAL

17:26.433 --> 17:28.300
DEMOCRATS AND CONSERVATIVE

17:28.366 --> 17:29.733
REPUBLICANS BECAUSE LOOK WHAT

17:29.800 --> 17:30.466
JUST HAPPENED WITH FACEBOOK.

17:30.533 --> 17:33.066
YOU HAVE PARENTS THAT LITERALLY,

17:33.133 --> 17:33.933
THEY CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEIR

17:34.000 --> 17:36.100
KIDS ARE SEEING, THEY TRIED TO.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.433
THIS ONE MOM TOLD ME --

17:38.500 --> 17:41.066
>> Bill: THAT'S SORT OF ON

17:41.133 --> 17:41.266
THEM.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.700
>> SHE'S TRYING TO MOP IT UP AS

17:42.766 --> 17:44.466
SHE'S TRYING TO CLOSE OFF EVERY

17:44.533 --> 17:45.866
LINK THAT POPS UP ON THEIR

17:45.933 --> 17:47.366
SCREEN, THAT IS WHAT IS

17:47.433 --> 17:48.100
HAPPENING.

17:48.166 --> 17:48.633
>> Bill: WHEN I WAS A KID

17:48.700 --> 17:51.500
NOBODY EVER SAID PARENTS, THEY

17:51.566 --> 17:53.466
CAN'T CONTROL -- MY FATHER

17:53.533 --> 17:56.766
WOULD'VE BEEN BEEN LIKE I CAN'T

17:56.833 --> 17:57.000
CONTROL?

17:57.066 --> 17:58.000
IT'S THE WILL OF THE PARENTS,

17:58.066 --> 18:01.133
THEY COULD CONTROL.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.066
>> YOU WOULD JUST DENY YOUR KIDS

18:04.133 --> 18:05.766
PHONES, THEY WOULD HAVE NO

18:05.833 --> 18:05.966
ACCESS.

18:06.033 --> 18:06.766
>> Bill: I'M SO GLAD I DON'T

18:06.833 --> 18:10.266
HAVE KIDS, I DON'T HAVE TO --

18:10.333 --> 18:11.266
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.233
>> Bill: THERE ARE SOME

18:12.300 --> 18:14.200
PARENTS WHO DO THAT, THEY DON'T

18:14.266 --> 18:16.966
CARE ABOUT BEING THEIR FRIEND,

18:17.033 --> 18:17.166
RIGHT?

18:17.233 --> 18:21.100
SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER?

18:21.166 --> 18:24.766
>> MY DAUGHTER -- YOU HEARD OF

18:24.833 --> 18:26.166
HELICOPTER PARENTS?

18:26.233 --> 18:27.800
SHE SAID YOU'RE A SUBMARINE MOM,

18:27.866 --> 18:28.900
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING UNDER THE

18:28.966 --> 18:31.233
SURFACE AND THEN YOU COME UP

18:31.300 --> 18:31.566
UNEXPECTEDLY.

18:31.633 --> 18:33.900
TO TELL ME WHAT I CAN'T DO.

18:33.966 --> 18:36.566
[APPLAUSE]

18:36.633 --> 18:38.100
I JUST DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE

18:38.166 --> 18:40.033
ON PARENTS, I THINK YOU SHOULD

18:40.100 --> 18:41.100
BE ABLE TO ALLOW SMALL

18:41.166 --> 18:43.833
BUSINESSES TO COMPETE, LET THE

18:43.900 --> 18:45.266
MARKET WORK, IT DOESN'T WORK

18:45.333 --> 18:47.233
WHEN YOU HAVE DOMINANT PLATFORMS

18:47.300 --> 18:48.100
ALL THE TIME.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.633
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF AN ISSUE

18:49.700 --> 18:51.500
WHERE I'VE GOT SIX REPUBLICANS,

18:51.566 --> 18:53.300
SIX DEMOCRATS ON A BILL THAT IS

18:53.366 --> 18:53.966
BEING COMMENDED IN TERMS OF WHAT

18:54.033 --> 18:56.366
YOU CAN DO BECAUSE WE HAVE NO

18:56.433 --> 18:58.100
RULES IN PLACE RIGHT NOW.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.433
>> Bill: YOU'RE SO RIGHT, IT'S

18:59.500 --> 19:01.600
SUCH A GREAT ISSUE TO WRITE A

19:01.666 --> 19:03.700
BOOK ABOUT.

19:03.766 --> 19:04.300
MONOPOLIES ARE OUT-OF-CONTROL.

19:04.366 --> 19:06.200
>> WHO WOULD DO THAT, WHO WOULD

19:06.266 --> 19:07.733
WRITE A WHOLE BOOK ON

19:07.800 --> 19:08.033
MONOPOLIES?

19:08.100 --> 19:09.600
>> Bill: YOU'RE RIGHT, AS AN

19:09.666 --> 19:10.833
ISSUE, IT'S SO IMPORTANT, IT'S

19:10.900 --> 19:11.600
SO OUT OF CONTROL COMPARED TO

19:11.666 --> 19:14.900
WHAT THEY WERE 50 YEARS AGO.

19:14.966 --> 19:15.866
IF YOU CAN GET ANY REPUBLICANS

SAY THEY DON'T MEAN THAT MUCH, I

20:17.600 --> 20:18.500

20:27.800 --> 20:30.100
DEMOCRATS GOT THEIR ASS KICKED.

20:30.166 --> 20:35.466
IT WAS CALLED A WOKE LASH IN THE

MEDIA, SOME OF THE PLACES IN

20:37.000 --> 20:39.133
BUFFALO, A SOCIALIST NAMED INDIA

20:39.200 --> 20:41.500
WALTON WAS ALONE ON THE BALLOT,

20:41.566 --> 20:43.133
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T RUN ANYBODY

AGAINST HER, SHE WON THE

20:44.833 --> 20:46.300

NEW JERSEY, MY HOME STATE, STEVE

21:00.533 --> 21:01.966
SWEENEY THE NUMBER TWO MOST

21:02.033 --> 21:03.166
POWERFUL POLITICIAN IN THE STATE

21:03.233 --> 21:11.000
LOST TO ED DURR, A TRUCK DRIVER

21:11.066 --> 21:13.400

21:13.466 --> 21:16.666
SHUT THE CAMPAIGN AND ON HIS

21:16.733 --> 21:17.433

21:17.500 --> 21:19.500
SOUNDS LIKE AN ADAM SANDLER

21:19.566 --> 21:21.466
MOVIE.

21:21.533 --> 21:22.633
AND IN VIRGINIA, THEY LOST --

21:22.700 --> 21:26.600
THIS IS A STATE BIDEN WON BY TEN

21:26.666 --> 21:27.233
POINTS.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.866
THEY LOST THE GOVERNOR,

21:28.933 --> 21:30.066

ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE HOUSE,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.900
ALWAYS SAY YOU HAVE TO DO AN

21:33.966 --> 21:34.133
AUTOPSY.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.733
WHAT'S THE AUTOPSY ON THE

21:36.800 --> 21:38.033
DEMOCRATS?

21:38.100 --> 21:40.033
>> IT'S A CENTER RIGHT COUNTRY

21:40.100 --> 21:40.566
AS JOE MANCHIN SAYS, THE

21:40.633 --> 21:42.766
DEMOCRATS HAVE OVERPLAYED THEIR

21:42.833 --> 21:45.000
HAND.

21:45.066 --> 21:47.066
TERRY McAULIFFE THOUGHT THAT

21:47.133 --> 21:48.233
BY USING THE PHRASE RACIST DOG

21:48.300 --> 21:52.533
WHISTLE, HE COULD REBUT A

21:52.600 --> 21:53.200
LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT FROM PARENTS

21:53.266 --> 21:54.433
CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH

21:54.500 --> 21:55.933
RACIAL ISSUES ARE BEING TAUGHT

21:56.000 --> 21:57.666
TO THEIR CHILDREN, HE WAS WRONG.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.500
UP TO ME THE MOST INTERESTING

21:59.566 --> 22:00.600
THING ABOUT VIRGINIA IS THAT

22:00.666 --> 22:03.600
ISSUE COULD TURN, COULD MAKE THE

22:03.666 --> 22:05.733
DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THE

22:05.800 --> 22:08.233
RACE, HOW IS IT THAT IT MADE THE

22:08.300 --> 22:10.300
DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THE

22:10.366 --> 22:11.600
RACE WHICH I ATTRIBUTE TO THE

22:11.666 --> 22:13.933
GENERAL WEAKNESS OF THE LEADER

22:14.000 --> 22:19.333
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

22:19.400 --> 22:20.266
PRESIDENT BIDEN AS SOMETHING

22:20.333 --> 22:21.733
LESS THAN THAT COMPELLING AND

22:21.800 --> 22:22.166
CHARISMATIC FIGURE.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.133
>> Bill: WE KNEW THAT GOING

22:24.200 --> 22:24.300
IN.

22:24.366 --> 22:28.833
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE ABOUT

22:28.900 --> 22:31.666
THE TOTAL CONSEQUENCE BUT

22:31.733 --> 22:32.933
CLEARLY IN THE INTERIM, I DON'T

22:33.000 --> 22:35.466
KNOW IF IT WAS QUITE THE OBAMA

22:35.533 --> 22:38.300
SHELLACKING DURING HIS FIRST

22:38.366 --> 22:40.200
MIDTERM BUT I THINK IT'S MORE OF

22:40.266 --> 22:42.266
A MIXED MESSAGE BECAUSE INDIA

22:42.333 --> 22:45.366
WALTON DID OF COURSE RAN

22:45.433 --> 22:48.266
UNOPPOSED, THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR

22:48.333 --> 22:48.800
WHO WAS ALREADY SUFFERING

22:48.866 --> 22:51.200
BECAUSE HE HANDLED POORLY THE

22:51.266 --> 22:54.733
AFTERMATH OF THE GEORGE FLOYD

22:54.800 --> 22:56.533
PROTESTS AND THE ECONOMIC

22:56.600 --> 22:57.566
RECOVERY OF THE BUFFALO

22:57.633 --> 23:00.533
RENAISSANCE, HE TOOK IT FOR

23:00.600 --> 23:02.133
GRANTED, HE BLEW HER OFF, HE

23:02.200 --> 23:03.566
WOULDN'T EVEN DEBATER AND THEN

23:03.633 --> 23:04.466
HE GOT INVOLVED.

23:04.533 --> 23:05.366
>> Bill: THAT'S SMALL

23:05.433 --> 23:06.733
POTATOES, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

23:06.800 --> 23:08.033
BIG WIN IN VIRGINIA.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.233
>> EVEN WITH BUFFALO, THE POINT

23:10.300 --> 23:12.133
IS IT WAS NOT A REFERENDUM ON

23:12.200 --> 23:13.500
WHETHER A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST

23:13.566 --> 23:14.100
COULD GOVERN BECAUSE SHE SPOKE

23:14.166 --> 23:15.566
TO THE ISSUES OF THE PEOPLE.

23:15.633 --> 23:19.000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT VIRGINIA,

23:19.066 --> 23:21.933
DARE I SAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE

23:22.033 --> 23:23.933
TRUMP TO BEAT UP ON.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.133
MAYBE ONE OF THE LESSONS IS HE'S

23:25.200 --> 23:26.566
NOT A GOOD WHIPPING BOY, A

23:26.633 --> 23:28.100
SUFFICIENT WHIPPING BOY TO GET

23:28.166 --> 23:28.700
YOU ELECTED.

23:28.766 --> 23:30.966
>> I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY

23:31.033 --> 23:31.166
TRUE.

23:31.233 --> 23:34.533
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING IS TRUMP

23:34.600 --> 23:36.066
HAS BEEN DISPLACED AND THEREFORE

23:36.133 --> 23:36.733
DISTRIBUTED.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.433
YOU DON'T NEED TRUMP INVOLVED,

23:38.500 --> 23:38.933
IT'S LIKE DAVE'S!

23:39.000 --> 23:41.833
AND OUT, HE'S THE GHOST IN THE

23:41.900 --> 23:42.833
MACHINE.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.300
PARENTS WHO WERE SPOOKED BY

23:44.366 --> 23:45.100
CRITICAL RACE THEORY, WHEN YOU

23:45.166 --> 23:46.400
ASKED THEM WHAT IT IS THEY DON'T

23:46.466 --> 23:48.633
KNOW, BUT WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS

23:48.700 --> 23:49.933
BLACK PEOPLE ARE BEING CENTERED,

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
THEIR HISTORY IS BEING TAKEN

23:51.066 --> 23:52.666
SERIOUSLY AND IF YOU SAY YOU ARE

23:52.733 --> 23:54.066
CONCERNED ABOUT HISTORY IN

23:54.133 --> 23:55.733
AMERICA, WHY IS IT WHEN IT COMES

23:55.800 --> 23:59.100
TO BLACK HISTORY, IT BECOMES A

23:59.166 --> 23:59.500
BITTER WAR.

23:59.566 --> 24:00.900
>> Bill: I FIND THAT THE

24:00.966 --> 24:17.400
DISINGENUOUS ARGUMENT.

24:17.466 --> 24:17.966
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT

24:18.033 --> 24:18.566
PEOPLE ARE OBJECTING TO, THERE

24:18.633 --> 24:19.200
ARE SOME PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY

24:19.266 --> 24:19.833
WHERE THEY WILL AND SOME PEOPLE

24:19.900 --> 24:20.366
WHO WILL BUT THEY ARE NOT

24:20.433 --> 24:21.000
OBJECTED TO BLACK HISTORY BEING

24:21.066 --> 24:21.633
TAUGHT, THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

24:21.700 --> 24:22.266
GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS JERICHO

24:22.333 --> 24:22.600
>> LIKE WHAT?

24:22.666 --> 24:23.100
>> Bill: LIKE SEPARATING

24:23.166 --> 24:23.766
CHILDREN BY RACE AND DESCRIBING

24:23.833 --> 24:24.433
THEM AS OPPRESSED OR OPPRESSOR.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.500
THERE ARE CHILDREN COMING HOME

24:25.566 --> 24:30.633
WHO FEEL TRAUMATIZED BY THIS.

24:30.700 --> 24:35.333
>> YOU DO KNOW THAT THE

24:35.400 --> 24:35.800
BEGINNING, AND I KNOW

24:35.866 --> 24:39.133
PROFESSOR LOURY KNOWS THAT, THE

24:39.200 --> 24:39.900
BEGINNING OF CRITICAL RACE

24:39.966 --> 24:41.866
THEORY IN MODERN TIMES WAS TWO

24:41.933 --> 24:43.566
YEARS AGO, CHRISTOPHER RUFO SAID

24:43.633 --> 24:46.433
I'M READING ANTIRATION LIST

24:46.500 --> 24:47.466
LITERATURE, HE SAID IT WILL MAKE

24:47.533 --> 24:49.133
GOOD PUBLICITY AND HE BEGAN TO

24:49.200 --> 24:50.033
DRIVE IT HOME.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.000
IT'S NOT CRITICAL RACE THEORY,

24:52.066 --> 24:53.600
IT'S THE NOTION OF CENTERING

24:53.666 --> 24:54.300
BLACK PEOPLE AS HISTORICAL

24:54.366 --> 24:56.166
AGENTS AND THE QUESTION IS IT

24:56.233 --> 24:59.100
YOU TALK ABOUT WHITE KIDS BEING

24:59.166 --> 25:00.100
TRAUMATIZED, REALLY?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.566
SO BLACK KIDS BEING MADE TO

25:01.633 --> 25:02.866
PORTRAY SLAVES -- WE HAVE

25:02.933 --> 25:04.100
STORIES ON BOTH SIDES.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.933
I DO THINK YOU ARE

25:06.000 --> 25:06.866
UNDERESTIMATING THE ANTIBLACK

25:06.933 --> 25:08.800
SENTIMENT THAT IS DEEPLY

25:08.866 --> 25:10.100
ENTRENCHED, THAT'S WAY BEYOND

25:10.166 --> 25:10.633
TRUMP.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.633
IT'S TROUBLING TO ME.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.133
IT'S NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP, IT'S

25:14.200 --> 25:14.600
THE PARTY ITSELF.

25:14.666 --> 25:17.866
[APPLAUSE]

25:17.933 --> 25:19.266
>> IT'S AMERICAN HISTORY WE ARE

25:19.333 --> 25:21.100
TALKING ABOUT IN THE QUESTION IS

25:21.166 --> 25:24.266
AND WHAT REGISTER DO WE TELL THE

25:24.333 --> 25:24.900
STORY?

25:24.966 --> 25:25.500
BLACKS DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE

25:25.566 --> 25:30.500
HISTORY FROM AMERICA.

25:30.566 --> 25:31.066
SECONDLY I HAVE TO OBSERVE,

25:31.133 --> 25:34.300
BUFFALO, NEW YORK, SOCIALISM,

25:34.366 --> 25:35.233
THIS IS THE RUST BELT, THIS IS

25:35.300 --> 25:38.266
WORKING CLASS, WHITE, HARD HAT

25:38.333 --> 25:41.133
ON THE EAST SIDE OF LAKE ERIE,

25:41.200 --> 25:41.400
NEW YORK.

25:41.466 --> 25:42.633
HOW DID YOU EVER THINK SOCIALISM

25:42.700 --> 25:45.300
WAS WINDOWSILL IN BUFFALO,

25:45.366 --> 25:45.633
NEW YORK?

25:45.700 --> 25:47.500
THEY DO THIS EVERY TIME, BY THEY

25:47.566 --> 25:48.900
COME I MEAN THE ACTIVISTS ON THE

25:48.966 --> 25:51.400
LEFT WHO WANT TO PUSH THE WOKE

25:51.466 --> 25:51.733
CANON.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.266
THEY DENY WHAT I SEE WITH MY

25:53.333 --> 25:54.300
LYING EYES IS WHAT I'M SEEING

25:54.366 --> 25:57.266
WITH MY LYING EYES.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.233
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

25:59.300 --> 26:00.566
PARSE WHAT DEREK BELL AND

26:00.633 --> 26:02.766
KIMBERLY CRENSHAW WROTE A NOTE

26:02.833 --> 26:03.833
WHILE REVIEW TO NOTE THE RACE

26:03.900 --> 26:04.866
ISSUE HAS COME INTO THE

26:04.933 --> 26:06.666
CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS

26:06.733 --> 26:07.300
HAPPENED THE AFTERMATH OF

26:07.366 --> 26:09.100
GEORGE FLOYD AND ALL OF THAT.

26:09.166 --> 26:13.300
DEFUND THE POLICE?

26:13.366 --> 26:14.800
DEFUND THE POLICE WHEN THE CRIME

26:14.866 --> 26:16.666
IS GOING UP, ONE HOMICIDE IS

26:16.733 --> 26:17.633
GOING THROUGH THE ROOF, WHEN

26:17.700 --> 26:19.233
PEOPLE ARE FEELING UNSAFE IN

26:19.300 --> 26:19.966
THEIR COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE ARE

26:20.033 --> 26:21.366
SAYING WE DIDN'T REALLY MEAN

26:21.433 --> 26:22.733
DEFUND THE POLICE, WE MEANT TO

26:22.800 --> 26:25.200
REARRANGE THE DECK CHAIRS ON THE

26:25.266 --> 26:27.366
TITANIC.

26:27.433 --> 26:32.166
I THINK THEY UNDERESTIMATE THE

26:32.233 --> 26:32.766
DETERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN

26:32.833 --> 26:36.733
PEOPLE TO RESIST A CERTAIN KIND

26:36.800 --> 26:37.333
OF INTERPRETATION OF THE STORY

26:37.400 --> 26:40.233
OF THE COUNTRY, THERE'S MANY

26:40.300 --> 26:42.000
DIFFERENT WAYS OF TELLING THAT

26:42.066 --> 26:42.933
STORY AND WE AFRICAN-AMERICANS

26:43.000 --> 26:44.200
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME INTO

26:44.266 --> 26:45.200
SOME UNDERSTANDING WITH THE REST

26:45.266 --> 26:46.666
OF THE COUNTRY ABOUT HOW WE TELL

26:46.733 --> 26:49.933
THE STORY TOGETHER.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.900
>> THAT'S FASCINATING, I AGREE

26:51.966 --> 26:53.633
WITH YOU THAT BLACK HISTORY AS

26:53.700 --> 26:54.200
AMERICAN HISTORY OF AMERICA

26:54.266 --> 26:56.166
REALIZED THAT.

26:56.233 --> 26:57.233
THE REASON THERE'S A SEGREGATED

26:57.300 --> 26:59.666
BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS BECAUSE

26:59.733 --> 27:01.266
THERE HAS BEEN THE ALIENATION OF

27:01.333 --> 27:04.600
THE NARRATIVE OF BLACK PEOPLE'S

27:04.666 --> 27:05.300
PARTICIPATION IN THE AMERICAN

27:05.366 --> 27:06.066
STORY.

27:06.133 --> 27:07.266
THE NECESSITY FOR THEM

27:07.333 --> 27:09.466
HIGHLIGHTING, UNDERSCORING, AND

27:09.533 --> 27:10.200
SPOTLIGHTING BLACK PEOPLE HAS

27:10.266 --> 27:11.433
BEEN PRECISELY BECAUSE WE HAVE

27:11.500 --> 27:13.266
NOT BEEN SEEN AS AMERICAN.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.800
IT STARTED WITH THOMAS JEFFERSON

27:15.866 --> 27:17.233
WHEN HE SAID "BLACK PEOPLE ARE

27:17.300 --> 27:18.966
ON THE OIL CITIZENS IN THE

27:19.033 --> 27:19.600
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND

27:19.666 --> 27:23.066
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WERE SAVAGES.

27:23.133 --> 27:24.266
MY POINT IS SIMPLY THIS.

27:24.333 --> 27:25.900
TO BELIEVE THAT THE CRITICAL

27:25.966 --> 27:28.266
RACE THEORY, IT'S NOT A DEBATE,

27:28.333 --> 27:29.233
THEY ARE DEBATING KIMBERLY

27:29.300 --> 27:30.266
CRENSHAW OR DEREK BELL, THEY ARE

27:30.333 --> 27:31.500
DEBATING THE FACT THAT FINALLY

27:31.566 --> 27:33.066
IF WE LOOK AT THE TEXT BOOKS,

27:33.133 --> 27:33.633
TEXTBOOKS HAVE BEEN DOING A

27:33.700 --> 27:35.166
HORRIBLE JOB OF TRYING TO

27:35.233 --> 27:37.900
EDUCATE OUR KIDS ABOUT RACE.

27:37.966 --> 27:39.100
IF CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS

27:39.166 --> 27:40.400
GETTING IT SO WRONG, LET'S GO

27:40.466 --> 27:42.266
BACK TO A TIME IN HISTORY WHERE

27:42.333 --> 27:45.233
WE TAUGHT HISTORY RIGHT -- THE

27:45.300 --> 27:47.300
HISTORY TEXTBOOKS THAT GAVE

27:47.366 --> 27:47.833
SLAVERY ONE WEEK,

27:47.900 --> 27:48.500
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., ONE DAY,

27:48.566 --> 27:50.366
AND THAT'S IT.

27:50.433 --> 27:52.700
IT'S NOT AS IF WHAT IS

27:52.766 --> 27:55.333
PREVAILING BEFORE WAS A COMPLETE

27:55.400 --> 27:56.633
AND THOROUGH ENGAGEMENT AND

27:56.700 --> 27:57.233
INVENTING OF BLACK PEOPLE IN

27:57.300 --> 27:57.533
HISTORY.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.200
I SAY LET'S HAVE IT AS AMERICAN

27:59.266 --> 28:03.866
HISTORY BUT ACKNOWLEDGE US.

28:03.933 --> 28:04.133
[APPLAUSE]

28:04.200 --> 28:08.400
>> Bill: YOU MAKE IT SO POLAR.

28:08.466 --> 28:11.033
YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO

28:11.100 --> 28:12.666
BACK TO --

28:12.733 --> 28:14.200
>> THE TEXTBOOKS ARE BEING

28:14.266 --> 28:15.833
PRODUCED NOW, I'M NOT TALKING

28:15.900 --> 28:17.466
ABOUT SOMETHING WAY BACK IN THE

28:17.533 --> 28:19.966
DAY, RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T EVEN

28:20.033 --> 28:21.433
RECOGNIZE THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF

28:21.500 --> 28:23.166
IDENTITIES AND CONFLICTS AND

28:23.233 --> 28:24.333
TENSIONS THAT BLACK PEOPLE

28:24.400 --> 28:26.733
PARTICIPATED IN ALONG WITH

28:26.800 --> 28:27.333
AMERICANS, OTHER AMERICANS TO

28:27.400 --> 28:28.266
MAKE THIS NATION, THAT'S ALL WE

28:28.333 --> 28:30.566
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

28:30.633 --> 28:31.366
>> Bill: THAT'S NOT ALL WE ARE

28:31.433 --> 28:34.066
TALKING ABOUT.

28:34.133 --> 28:35.700
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS WHO

28:35.766 --> 28:37.700
SEEM TO BE TOO YOUNG SOMETIMES

28:37.766 --> 28:39.300
TO FULLY APPRECIATE ALL THIS.

28:39.366 --> 28:41.233
I THINK IF THEY WATCHED YOU,

28:41.300 --> 28:42.300
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW A

28:42.366 --> 28:44.833
LOT OF THOSE WORDS.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.133
TO ASK THEM TO AS OPPOSED TO

28:46.200 --> 28:49.433
JUST LETTING KIDS BE KIDS,

28:49.500 --> 28:50.300
USUALLY KIDS ARE PRETTY NICE TO

28:50.366 --> 28:53.266
EACH OTHER IF THEY ARE NOT

28:53.333 --> 28:54.066
INSTRUCTED NOT TO BE.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.233
>> I GOT A BOOK COMING OUT IN

28:57.300 --> 28:59.333
MAY THAT'S CALLED "UNEQUAL"

28:59.400 --> 29:00.333
THAT'S DIRECTED TOWARDS TEENS,

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
THEY UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD IN

29:01.466 --> 29:01.833
THERE.

29:01.900 --> 29:02.933
>> Bill: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

29:03.000 --> 29:03.666
YOUNGER THAN THAT.

29:03.733 --> 29:06.766
>> WE NEED TO BE GETTING BEYOND

29:06.833 --> 29:07.500
RACE, FRANKLY.

29:07.566 --> 29:08.233
WE ARE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, NOT

29:08.300 --> 29:09.633
THE 19TH CENTURY.

29:09.700 --> 29:14.366
LOOK AT THE MARRIAGE RATES, LOOK

29:14.433 --> 29:18.833
AT HOW THE COUNTRY HAS CHANGING.

29:18.900 --> 29:20.233
THE ASIANS ARE HERE, THEY ARE

29:20.300 --> 29:26.266
CONTINUING TO COME.

29:26.333 --> 29:26.866
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE

29:26.933 --> 29:29.366
GOING TO BE ON THE CONTRARY,

29:29.433 --> 29:32.133
THIS GENERATION SHOULD NOT BE

29:32.200 --> 29:32.766
PUT INTO FOX'S BLACK-AND-WHITE,

29:32.833 --> 29:33.400
THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO

29:33.466 --> 29:35.733
WHAT IS NATURALLY WHICH IS CROSS

29:35.800 --> 29:39.466
THE LINES.

29:39.533 --> 29:42.500
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

29:42.566 --> 29:44.700
>> THAT POINT WE CAN CERTAINLY

29:44.766 --> 29:44.966
AGREE ON.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.500
THE PROBLEM IS YOU THINK THE

29:48.566 --> 29:49.400
PEOPLE OF COLOR, THE BLACK

29:49.466 --> 29:51.666
PEOPLE WHO POINT TO THE FACT

29:51.733 --> 29:52.866
THAT HAS BEEN A FAILED

29:52.933 --> 29:54.266
EXPERIMENT AND THAT HAS NOT

29:54.333 --> 29:55.333
OCCURRED, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A

29:55.400 --> 29:59.000
RACE NEUTRAL APPROACH, IT HAS

29:59.066 --> 30:01.800
BEEN DEEPLY INSCRIBED.

30:01.866 --> 30:03.633
>> Bill: FAILED IN THE SENSE

30:03.700 --> 30:05.100
THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS?

30:05.166 --> 30:07.466
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT, THAT'S A

30:07.533 --> 30:08.433
STRAWMAN ARGUMENT.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.700
OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.500
>> Bill: USE IT FAILED.

30:11.566 --> 30:13.266
>> IF YOU SAY WE NEED TO

30:13.333 --> 30:14.666
TRANSCEND RACE AND ALL THESE

30:14.733 --> 30:16.100
BOXES, BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT THE

30:16.166 --> 30:17.933
ONES PUTTING FOLK IN BOXES.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.666
WHEN WE LOOK AT AMERICAN

30:20.733 --> 30:21.533
SOCIETY, BLACK PEOPLE ARE

30:21.600 --> 30:23.066
ASPIRING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE

30:23.133 --> 30:24.600
LARGER CIRCLE OF AMERICAN

30:24.666 --> 30:24.866
PRIVILEGE.

30:24.933 --> 30:26.666
THEY ARE NOT THE ONES WHO WANT

30:26.733 --> 30:27.500
TO STAY SEGREGATED.

30:27.566 --> 30:30.000
>> WHY IS IT A MICRO-AGGRESSION

30:30.066 --> 30:31.900
FOR A PROFESSOR TO SAY IN A

30:31.966 --> 30:32.866
COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY.

30:32.933 --> 30:34.000
IF A WHITE PROFESSOR STANDS UP

30:34.066 --> 30:35.933
AT UNIVERSITY AND SAYS A

30:36.033 --> 30:37.933
COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY, HE CAN

30:38.000 --> 30:38.200
EXPECT --

30:38.266 --> 30:39.733
>> Bill: OR AT LEAST THAT'S

30:39.800 --> 30:42.266
WHAT WE ASPIRE TO.

30:42.333 --> 30:43.000
WHEN YOU SAY SEGREGATION, A LOT

30:43.066 --> 30:47.500
OF THE SEGREGATION IS WORKING

30:47.566 --> 30:48.466
THE OTHER WAY.

30:48.533 --> 30:49.900
SEGREGATED DORMS AT COLLEGE

30:49.966 --> 30:51.933
CAMPUSES, THEY AREN'T WHITE

30:52.000 --> 30:52.566
SEGREGATED, THEY ARE BLACK FOLKS

30:52.633 --> 30:53.566
WHO WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT WHITE

30:53.633 --> 30:57.833
PEOPLE IN THEIR DORM.

30:57.900 --> 30:58.600
SEVERAL GRADUATION CEREMONIES.

30:58.666 --> 31:00.033
>> YOU KNOW IT'S JUST LIKE WHY

31:00.100 --> 31:02.333
ARE ALL THE BLACK KIDS SITTING

31:02.400 --> 31:04.333
TOGETHER YOU PASS A 25 TABLES OF

31:04.400 --> 31:06.466
WHITE KIDS SITTING TOGETHER TO

31:06.533 --> 31:09.133
FIND THE SIX TABLE?

31:09.200 --> 31:11.233
>> Bill: IS THAT THE YEAR WE

31:11.300 --> 31:12.200
ARE LIVING IN NOW?

31:12.266 --> 31:13.100
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT THE YEAR

31:13.166 --> 31:14.733
WE ARE LIVING IN NOW WITH THE

31:14.800 --> 31:16.333
WHITE KIDS WON'T SIT WITH THE

31:16.400 --> 31:17.600
BLACK KIDS AT COLLEGE.

31:17.666 --> 31:19.866
>> THAT'S SIMPLISTIC AND

31:19.933 --> 31:20.533
REDUCTIVE.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.666
>> Bill: YOU SAID IT!

31:21.733 --> 31:23.466
>> I'M RESPONDING TO YOU SAYING

31:23.533 --> 31:24.633
THERE WAS SEGREGATION, I'M

31:24.700 --> 31:26.900
TELLING YOU IT'S NOT AS IF BLACK

31:26.966 --> 31:28.666
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE

31:28.733 --> 31:30.033
IN AMERICAN SOCIETY, THE

31:30.100 --> 31:31.800
BARRIERS ARE THERE AND WE ARE

31:31.866 --> 31:32.733
GETTING IGNORANT.

31:32.800 --> 31:38.633
>> Bill: I C HATE TO HARP ON

31:38.700 --> 31:40.433
THIS, COLLEGE CAMPUS, I HAVEN'T

31:40.500 --> 31:43.333
BEEN THERE IN A LONG TIME, I'M

31:43.400 --> 31:44.766
GETTING THIS FOR MOVIES AND TV

31:44.833 --> 31:45.700
AND EVERY HUMAN BEING I TALKED

31:45.766 --> 31:46.766
TO, OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T

31:46.833 --> 31:46.966
KNOW.

31:47.033 --> 31:49.300
I DON'T THINK ON A COLLEGE

31:49.366 --> 31:50.366
CAMPUS IT'S LIKE THE WHITE KIDS

31:50.433 --> 31:52.000
DON'T WANT TO BE WITH THE BLACK

31:52.066 --> 31:52.200
KIDS.

31:52.266 --> 31:54.766
I THINK THEY WANT TO GRAB ONTO

31:54.833 --> 31:59.466
THEIR COOLNESS.

31:59.533 --> 32:01.533
>> A SEMINAR AT BROWN HOSTED BY

32:01.600 --> 32:02.733
THE POLITICAL THEORY PROJECT

32:02.800 --> 32:04.066
THERE IN WHICH A GUY CAME AND

32:04.133 --> 32:06.200
GAVE A PAPER, IT WAS A VERY

32:06.266 --> 32:07.600
INTERESTING PAPER, THE AUDIENCE

32:07.666 --> 32:10.666
WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY WHITE GO

32:10.733 --> 32:10.833
WHY?

32:10.900 --> 32:15.600
BECAUSE THE HOST WHO INVITED THE

32:15.666 --> 32:16.833
SPEAKER IS MILDLY CONSERVATIVE.

32:16.900 --> 32:20.133
WHAT I TOOK FROM THAT IS HOW

32:20.200 --> 32:20.766
SEGREGATED, SELF SEGREGATED IS

32:20.833 --> 32:23.166
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE ON MY VERY

32:23.233 --> 32:23.433
CAMPUS?

32:23.500 --> 32:25.933
I DON'T WANT TO POINT FINGERS AT

32:26.000 --> 32:26.533
ANYBODY, I CAN TELL THERE WERE

32:26.600 --> 32:27.900
NO SIGNS OF THE DOOR SAYING

32:27.966 --> 32:28.766
BLACKS KEEP OUT, PEOPLE SIMPLY

32:28.833 --> 32:32.033
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.600
>> I DON'T DENY THE LEGITIMACY

32:34.666 --> 32:36.266
OF A SELF SEGREGATING ARGUMENT,

32:36.333 --> 32:38.233
WHAT I'M ARGUING, HOWEVER, IS

32:38.300 --> 32:39.833
THAT PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES

32:39.900 --> 32:41.200
ALIENATED IN SPACES THAT ARE NOT

32:41.266 --> 32:43.266
HOSPITABLE TO THEM, WHEN THEY

32:43.333 --> 32:44.000
ARE IN A MAJORITY SITUATION --

32:44.066 --> 32:46.200
IF YOU ARE A MAJORITY STUDENT,

32:46.266 --> 32:48.300
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE

32:48.366 --> 32:49.733
TO WHICH YOUR NORMAL EXPERIENCE

32:49.800 --> 32:51.466
MAY BE ALIENATING TO SOMEBODY

32:51.533 --> 32:52.566
WHO DOESN'T BELONG THERE OR

32:52.633 --> 32:55.233
DOESN'T FEEL THEY BELONG THERE.

32:55.300 --> 32:56.900
I TEACH CLASSES ALL THE TIME,

32:56.966 --> 32:59.733
THE MAJORITY OF MY STUDENTS ARE

32:59.800 --> 33:00.133
WHITE.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.600
THEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN, LATINO,

33:01.666 --> 33:03.333
AND SO FORTH.

33:03.400 --> 33:03.866
I HAVE A RAMBUNCTIOUS

33:03.933 --> 33:05.300
UNITED NATIONS KIND OF WAY.

33:05.366 --> 33:06.700
BUT WHAT WE DO THERE IS WE

33:06.766 --> 33:08.333
CONFRONT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

33:08.400 --> 33:09.300
IN THEIR OTHER CLASSES THEY ARE

33:09.366 --> 33:11.700
NOT GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO.

33:11.766 --> 33:14.000
THE VIRTUE OF HAVING A BLACK

33:14.066 --> 33:15.166
PROFESSOR OR PROFESSOR WHO

33:15.233 --> 33:17.066
STUDIES THAT ISSUE AND CULTURE

33:17.133 --> 33:18.466
IS TO HAVE A VERY PROFOUND

33:18.533 --> 33:19.766
ENGAGEMENT WITH A SET OF IDEAS

33:19.833 --> 33:21.300
THAT MANY OF THOSE WHITE

33:21.366 --> 33:24.400
STUDENTS ARE NOT USED TO DEALING

33:24.466 --> 33:25.100
WITH.

33:25.166 --> 33:26.100
THE DISCOMFORT COMES FROM

33:26.166 --> 33:26.966
CHALLENGING THE HISTORIES THEY

33:27.033 --> 33:29.266
BRING WITH THEM, I THINK THAT'S

33:29.333 --> 33:29.900
BEAUTIFUL.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.166
I THINK WHAT PROFESSOR LOURY

33:31.233 --> 33:32.533
SAID IS GOOD, WE SHOULD ALL HAVE

33:32.600 --> 33:34.933
THE ABILITY TO SAMPLE EACH

33:35.000 --> 33:38.666
OTHER'S CULTURES AND IDEAS AND

33:38.733 --> 33:39.666
WAYS OF THINKING.

33:39.733 --> 33:40.800
>> Bill: BUT WE DON'T WANT TO

33:40.866 --> 33:42.666
LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE TO DO IT.

33:42.733 --> 33:44.633
>> LET'S NOT PRETEND

33:44.700 --> 33:45.600
BLACK STUDENTS TALKING ABOUT

33:45.666 --> 33:47.466
LIVING IN A THEMED HOUSE ARE THE

33:47.533 --> 33:48.466
ONES CARRYING THE WATER FOR

33:48.533 --> 33:49.233
SEGREGATION IN AMERICA, THAT'S

33:49.300 --> 33:52.166
JUST NOT TRUE.

33:52.233 --> 33:56.466
[APPLAUSE]

33:56.533 --> 33:57.100
>> Bill: IT'S CALLED A THEMED

33:57.166 --> 33:59.233
HOUSE?

33:59.300 --> 34:00.866
>> WHAT MY GOOD BROTHER HERE IS

34:00.933 --> 34:02.633
A SAYING, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S

34:02.700 --> 34:06.166
GOING ON IN NEWSROOMS, 1619

34:06.233 --> 34:07.233
PROJECT IN NEW YORK TIMES AND SO

34:07.300 --> 34:08.333
FORTH, YOU LOOK AT THE

34:08.400 --> 34:09.000
FOUNDATION WORLD THAT THEY GIVE

34:09.066 --> 34:11.033
OUT THE AWARDS AND GIVE UP THE

34:11.100 --> 34:12.433
GRANTS, THEY ARE DEFINITELY

34:12.500 --> 34:14.200
POLITICALLY CORRECT AND WOKE ON

34:14.266 --> 34:15.300
THE RACIAL ISSUES.

34:15.366 --> 34:16.633
LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

34:16.700 --> 34:17.966
PERSONNEL OFFICES IN THE BIG

34:18.033 --> 34:19.633
COMPANIES OF THE COUNTRY, THEY

34:19.700 --> 34:21.066
ARE MANAGING THEIR BRANDS BY

34:21.133 --> 34:23.233
MAKING SURE THEY GET THE

34:23.300 --> 34:24.233
WINDOW DRESSING RIGHTS WITH

34:24.300 --> 34:25.966
RESPECT TO THE RACIAL ISSUES.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.066
AND ON AND ON.

34:27.133 --> 34:31.066
>> HOW IS 1619 -- JAKE

34:31.133 --> 34:34.000
SILVERSTEIN --

34:34.066 --> 34:37.833
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.800
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO DEBATE THE

34:40.866 --> 34:42.900
6019 PROJECT, I'M TRYING TO SAY

34:42.966 --> 34:44.300
POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS ARE

34:44.366 --> 34:44.933
ORIENTING THEMSELVES TO BE OPEN

34:45.000 --> 34:46.900
TO THE VERY QUESTIONS THAT

34:46.966 --> 34:47.800
YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE NOT OPEN

34:47.866 --> 34:48.900
TO, THAT'S ALL WE TALK ABOUT IN

34:48.966 --> 34:50.566
THIS COUNTRY IS RACE.

34:50.633 --> 34:52.766
>> THE REASON THEY ARE DOING IT

34:52.833 --> 34:54.200
DOES NOT BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN

34:54.266 --> 34:56.700
THEY SAY IT'S A GREAT IDEA,

34:56.766 --> 34:58.766
PEOPLE LIKE NICOLE HANNAH JONES

34:58.833 --> 34:59.766
PRESENT IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

34:59.833 --> 35:01.166
MAGAZINE IS A BLACK WOMAN

35:01.233 --> 35:02.166
JOURNALIST WINNING A

35:02.233 --> 35:03.400
PULITZER PRIZE MAKES SURE SHE

35:03.466 --> 35:04.866
BRINGS A KIND OF RHETORICAL

35:04.933 --> 35:06.266
PRESSURE TO BEAR SO THEY OPEN

35:06.333 --> 35:06.433
UP.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.333
THEY DON'T OPEN UP ON THEIR OWN,

35:08.400 --> 35:13.700
POWER CONCEDES NOTHING WITHOUT A

35:13.766 --> 35:13.933
DEMAND.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.100
[APPLAUSE]

35:17.166 --> 35:18.500
>> Bill: IT WAS WRITTEN AND

35:18.566 --> 35:19.733
NOW WE CAN DEBATE IT.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.866
I HAVE TO INTERRUPT FOR ONE

35:20.933 --> 35:23.700
MINUTE BECAUSE I HAVE TO TALK

35:23.766 --> 35:25.666
ABOUT, I THINK WE HAVE BEEN

35:25.733 --> 35:26.800
CHRONICLING ON THIS SHOW THE

35:26.866 --> 35:28.200
DIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS OF THE

35:28.266 --> 35:29.433
RIGHT WING HAS BEEN GOING

35:29.500 --> 35:31.100
THROUGH TO JUSTIFY THE

35:31.166 --> 35:32.333
JANUARY 6TH INSURRECTION OF THE

35:32.400 --> 35:32.966
CAPITAL.

35:33.033 --> 35:34.466
AND FIRST WAS ANTIFA THAT DID

35:34.533 --> 35:36.300
IT.

35:36.366 --> 35:37.433
THEN IT WAS LIBERALS DRESSED AS

35:37.500 --> 35:40.400
US, THAT'S MY FAVORITE.

35:40.466 --> 35:43.033
LIKE A MIKAEL'S NAVY EPISODE.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.666
IT'S THEM DRESSED AS US.

35:44.733 --> 35:46.433
THEN IT WAS THE FBI.

35:46.500 --> 35:47.900
NOW THEY'VE COME AROUND TO

35:47.966 --> 35:49.366
ACTUALLY EMBRACE THE IDEA THAT

35:49.433 --> 35:52.000
NO IT WASN'T A BAD DAY AFTER

35:52.066 --> 35:54.600
ALL, IT WAS US AND WE ARE PROUD

35:54.666 --> 35:55.233
OF IT.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.000
THEY ARE OWNING IT, MARJORIE

35:56.066 --> 35:57.533
TAYLOR GREENE HAD A QUOTE ABOUT

35:57.600 --> 35:59.833
IT THIS WEEK, THEY ARE BASICALLY

35:59.900 --> 36:01.033
SAYING THESE WERE BRAVE

36:01.100 --> 36:01.466
PATRIOTS.

36:01.533 --> 36:03.266
TO THE POINT WHERE WE THOUGHT WE

36:03.333 --> 36:04.633
COULD MAKE SOME MONEY ON THIS.

36:04.700 --> 36:08.366
HERE AT REAL TIME WE ARE THE

36:08.433 --> 36:11.166
FRANKLIN MINT.

36:11.233 --> 36:12.800
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE GOING

36:12.866 --> 36:15.866
TO SELL.

36:15.933 --> 36:18.733
>> YOU WATCHED ON TV, NO YOU CAN

36:18.800 --> 36:20.166
RELIVE EVERY MOMENT WITH THE

36:20.233 --> 36:22.133

36:24.033 --> 36:24.266

36:27.033 --> 36:27.700
ALL DISTINCTIVELY HANDCRAFTED BY

36:27.766 --> 36:29.233
AMERICAN LABORERS.

36:29.300 --> 36:29.866
YOU'LL GET.

36:29.933 --> 36:30.500
ASHLI BABBITT.

36:30.566 --> 36:31.433
SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY.

36:31.500 --> 36:32.800
THE GUY WHO STOLE THE PODIUM.

36:32.866 --> 36:33.933
THE GUY BEAR SPRAYING A CAPITOL

36:34.000 --> 36:35.200
POLICE OFFICER.

36:35.266 --> 36:36.366
THE GUY WHO ATTACKED POLICE WITH

36:36.433 --> 36:38.000
A CRUTCH.

36:38.066 --> 36:39.000
THE HANGING OFF THE SENATE

36:39.066 --> 36:40.266
BALCONY GUY.

36:40.333 --> 36:41.300

37:09.966 --> 37:13.333
DAY, AND THIS COMMEMORATIVE RUDY

37:13.400 --> 37:14.366
GIULIANI SYRUP DISPENSER.

37:21.233 --> 37:27.800
HISTORY.]

37:27.866 --> 37:30.366
[LAUGHTER]

37:30.433 --> 37:34.400
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

37:34.466 --> 37:38.100
>> Bill: OKAY, I HAVE TO ASK

37:38.166 --> 37:40.833
YOU A QUESTION THAT I SHOULD'VE

37:40.900 --> 37:42.633
ASKED AMY KLOBUCHAR AND WE RAN

37:42.700 --> 37:43.233
OUT OF TIME.

37:43.300 --> 37:44.966
PARTED THE ELECTION INTO A STAY

37:45.033 --> 37:46.266
IN IT HAPPENED IN MINNEAPOLIS >>

37:46.333 --> 37:49.600
THEY VOTED ON WHETHER TO REPLACE

37:49.666 --> 37:50.566
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN

37:50.633 --> 37:51.900
MINNEAPOLIS WITH A DEPARTMENT OF

37:51.966 --> 37:55.633
PUBLIC SAFETY, WHICH WOULD

37:55.700 --> 37:57.766
INCLUDE, IT SOUNDS OF COURSE AS

37:57.833 --> 37:58.866
ALWAYS DEMOCRATS HORRIBLE AT

37:58.933 --> 38:00.033
MESSAGING AND LANGUAGE, THEY

38:00.100 --> 38:01.233
SHOULD NEVER SAY D FROM THE

38:01.300 --> 38:02.300
POLICE IT'S A BAD SAYING.

38:02.366 --> 38:03.300
THIS SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE

38:03.366 --> 38:04.733
GETTING WIND OF THE POLICE, KNOW

38:04.800 --> 38:06.700
THEY ARE FOLDING THE POLICE INTO

38:06.766 --> 38:08.200
A DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD INCLUDE

38:08.266 --> 38:09.300
THERAPISTS, SOCIAL WORKERS,

38:09.366 --> 38:12.233
WHICH I THINK IS GREAT.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.100
BECAUSE POLICE ARE ALREADY DOING

38:13.166 --> 38:15.166
THOSE JOBS AND IT'S NOT REALLY

38:15.233 --> 38:17.033
THEIR JOB.

38:17.100 --> 38:17.766
THEN THEY HAVE TO INCLUDE

38:17.833 --> 38:19.200
VIOLENCE INTERRUPTERS, SO

38:19.266 --> 38:22.833
TYPICAL OF THE DEMOCRATS.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.200
GIVE US A PUNCH LINE BECAUSE

38:24.266 --> 38:25.833
COMEDIANS WILL RUN WITH IT, I

38:25.900 --> 38:27.133
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS

38:27.200 --> 38:28.233
VIOLENCE INTERRUPTERS.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.133
HERE IS MY QUESTION, A MAJORITY

38:30.200 --> 38:32.200
OF BLACK VOTERS OPPOSED THE

38:32.266 --> 38:36.433
MEASURE TO REPLACE THE POLICE

38:36.500 --> 38:37.066
DEPARTMENT, A MAJORITY OF WHITE

38:37.133 --> 38:39.266
VOTERS SUPPORTED IT.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.066
THIS IS WHAT I'VE SAID BEFORE ON

38:40.133 --> 38:44.400
THE SHOW.

38:44.466 --> 38:46.566
ONE OF THE BIG PARTS OF WHITE

38:46.633 --> 38:48.833
PRIVILEGE, THE LUXURY TO BE

38:48.900 --> 38:52.233
IMPRACTICAL.

38:52.300 --> 38:53.766
WHEN THEY DO POLES THEY OFTEN

38:53.833 --> 38:54.500
FIND IT'S THE WHITE LIBERALS

38:54.566 --> 38:57.900
WERE WAY MORE LIBERAL THAN THE

38:57.966 --> 39:00.833
MAINSTREAM BLACK PERSON AND I

39:00.900 --> 39:02.800
THINK ONLY 28% OF BLACKS SELF

39:02.866 --> 39:05.166
IDENTIFY AS LIBERAL.

39:05.233 --> 39:07.400
>> I DON'T THINK THIS IS

39:07.466 --> 39:09.566
COMPLICATED, I THINK PEOPLE LIVE

39:09.633 --> 39:10.400
IN HIGH CRIME NEIGHBORHOODS WANT

39:10.466 --> 39:12.433
TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE

39:12.500 --> 39:14.566
DEPREDATIONS OF CRIMINALS.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.600
I THINK THE BLACKS ARE LIVING IN

39:16.666 --> 39:18.166
AREAS WHERE THEY ARE BEING

39:18.233 --> 39:19.600
VICTIMIZED BY CARJACKINGS AND

39:19.666 --> 39:20.800
MUGGINGS IN HOMICIDES AND

39:20.866 --> 39:21.333
DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.266
THE POLICE ARE NOT A PANACEA BUT

39:23.333 --> 39:24.100
THEY DEFINITELY ARE ON THE RIGHT

39:24.166 --> 39:26.166
SIDE OF THAT EQUATION.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.400
THE WHITES ARE NOT LIVING IN

39:27.466 --> 39:29.000
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS, THEY ARE

39:29.066 --> 39:29.766
NOT HAVING THOSE EXPERIENCES,

39:29.833 --> 39:30.566
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

39:30.633 --> 39:38.900
FEELINGS ABOUT THE POLICE.

39:38.966 --> 39:41.633
>> I WOULD BE AN OUTLIER, THE

39:41.700 --> 39:42.733
MAJORITY OF BLACK PEOPLE --

39:42.800 --> 39:43.600
BLACK PEOPLE CALL THE COPS MORE

39:43.666 --> 39:45.666
THAN ANYBODY, QUITE FRANKLY.

39:45.733 --> 39:48.266
BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING IN SUCH

39:48.333 --> 39:48.500
HORROR.

39:48.566 --> 39:51.966
IF THEY ARE LIVING IN SUCH TIGHT

39:52.033 --> 39:53.500
SITUATIONS PROPERTY AT STAKE,

39:53.566 --> 39:56.566
LIVES AT STAKE, THEY WANT TO

39:56.633 --> 39:57.666
CALL THE COPS BUT THEY WANT THE

39:57.733 --> 39:58.966
COPS WHEN THEY SHOW UP NOT TO

39:59.033 --> 40:00.433
MISTAKE THEM FOR THE CRIMINAL

40:00.500 --> 40:03.266
AND NOT KILL THEM.

40:03.333 --> 40:04.233
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE OPEN TO A

40:04.300 --> 40:06.033
NOTION OF REFORM.

40:06.100 --> 40:10.066
I'M NOT AGAINST THE LEFT

40:10.133 --> 40:11.066
LEARNING SOME SKILL AND SOME

40:11.133 --> 40:12.733
GAIN, DO YOU WANT THE COMMERCIAL

40:12.800 --> 40:14.000
OR THE PRODUCT?

40:14.066 --> 40:15.366
INVEST IN PROPRIETARY LANGUAGE,

40:15.433 --> 40:16.866
I DON'T GIVE A DARN ABOUT THE

40:16.933 --> 40:17.133
LANGUAGE.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.933
IF WE ARE GOING TO MOVE

40:19.000 --> 40:20.966
RESOURCES, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN

40:21.033 --> 40:22.000
L.A.

40:22.066 --> 40:28.500
$150 MILLION MOVED IN NEW YORK,

40:28.566 --> 40:30.366
$150 MILLION MOVED.

40:30.433 --> 40:31.900

40:45.033 --> 40:46.800

41:44.533 --> 41:45.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YEAR IT

41:45.066 --> 41:48.066

42:05.033 --> 42:05.533
THOSE BLACK PEOPLE.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.933
THIS IS WHY IF WE REALLY STUDIED

42:08.000 --> 42:09.566
CRITICAL RACE THEORY, WHAT IT

42:09.633 --> 42:10.866
SAYS IS IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

INDIVIDUAL IT'S ABOUT THE

42:11.933 --> 42:12.166

I'M NOT TRYING TO BLAME DEREK

42:19.100 --> 42:20.933

42:21.000 --> 42:23.600
AND COLONIZING BLACK BODIES.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.033
IT HAS PAID OFF BECAUSE THAT WAS

43:42.266 --> 43:43.433
POLICING CAN BE IMPROVED, IT

43:43.500 --> 43:45.800
SHOULD BE IMPROVED, BUT THIS IS

43:45.866 --> 43:46.600
NOT A FIRST-ORDER THREAT TO THE

INTEGRITY OF THE BLACKBODY.

44:22.333 --> 44:24.600
BY BLACKS AND I DON'T THINK WE

48:38.633 --> 48:39.400
GENERATION?

48:39.466 --> 48:40.166
THE MODEL CITIZEN?

48:40.233 --> 48:45.000
OR THE MODEL?

48:45.066 --> 48:45.666
THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO REFUSES TO

48:45.733 --> 48:46.666
FLY.

48:46.733 --> 48:47.666
OR THE ONE WHO REFUSES TO

48:47.733 --> 48:48.600
FLY COMMERCIAL?

48:48.666 --> 48:50.100
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

48:50.166 --> 48:51.100
GRETA GETS WHERE SHE'S GOING ON

48:51.166 --> 48:52.700
A SAILBOAT, POWERED BY THE WIND.

48:52.766 --> 48:54.100
KYLIE TAKES A PRIVATE JET,

48:54.166 --> 48:58.166
POWERED BY EXXON.

48:58.233 --> 49:01.000
AND SHE'S 21 TIMES MORE POPULAR.

49:01.066 --> 49:02.100
NOW, THIS IS NOT A SCREED

49:02.166 --> 49:03.966
AGAINST COMFORT OR CAPITALISM,

49:04.033 --> 49:06.600
I'M FOND OF BOTH.

49:06.666 --> 49:07.900
AND I GIVE KYLIE CREDIT: SHE'S

49:07.966 --> 49:09.100
BUILT A MASSIVE BUSINESS EMPIRE

49:09.166 --> 49:10.033
WITHOUT EVER RELEASING A SEX

49:10.100 --> 49:19.300
TAPE.

49:19.366 --> 49:19.566
[LAUGHTER]

49:19.633 --> 49:20.433
[APPLAUSE]

49:20.500 --> 49:21.400
AND LIKE HER DAD, SHE'S A

49:21.466 --> 49:27.400
SELF-MADE WOMAN.

49:27.466 --> 49:30.800
[LAUGHTER]

49:30.866 --> 49:32.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

49:32.233 --> 49:33.000
BUT KYLIE EMBODIES AND EMBRACES

49:33.066 --> 49:34.133
A LIFESTYLE THAT IS PRETTY MUCH

49:34.200 --> 49:35.200
THE OPPOSITE OF CARBON NEUTRAL,

49:35.266 --> 49:36.266
AND THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS

49:36.333 --> 49:38.600
FUCKING LOVE IT.

49:38.666 --> 49:40.166
LAST WEEK KYLIE POSTED A TOUR OF

49:40.233 --> 49:41.733
HER SHOE CLOSET, WHICH HOUSES

49:41.800 --> 49:44.233
"WELL OVER A THOUSAND PAIRS;"

49:44.300 --> 49:45.400
SHE ALSO HAS ENTIRE ROOMS OF

49:45.466 --> 49:48.100
THINGS SHE'S ONLY WORN ONCE.

49:48.166 --> 49:48.800
I DON'T THINK GRETA WOULD

49:48.866 --> 49:53.800
APPROVE OF THAT.

49:53.866 --> 49:54.066
[LAUGHTER]

49:54.133 --> 49:55.266
IN POLLS, YOUNG PEOPLE ALWAYS

49:55.333 --> 49:56.233
CLAIM TO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

49:56.300 --> 49:57.233
CLIMATE CHANGE THAN OTHER

49:57.300 --> 49:58.100
GENERATIONS, BUT THEY DON'T ACT

49:58.166 --> 49:59.800
LIKE IT.

49:59.866 --> 50:01.600
THEY THROW AROUND BUZZWORDS LIKE

50:01.666 --> 50:03.200
"SUSTAINABLE," AND SHAME PEOPLE

50:03.266 --> 50:04.800
WHO FORGET TO BRING A CLOTH BAG

50:04.866 --> 50:07.400
TO TRADER JOE'S, BUT ONE OF

50:07.466 --> 50:08.566
THEIR FAVORITE YOUTUBERS IS MR.

50:08.633 --> 50:10.866
BEAST, WHO'S FAMOUS FOR STUNTS

50:10.933 --> 50:12.666
LIKE "I GAVE MY 40 MILLIONTH

50:12.733 --> 50:15.700
SUBSCRIBER 40 CARS."

50:15.766 --> 50:17.433
JASON DERULO CELEBRATED HIS 22ND

50:17.500 --> 50:18.500
MILLIONTH FOLLOWER BY EATING 22

50:18.566 --> 50:21.400
HAMBURGERS.

50:21.466 --> 50:22.733
THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE BETWEEN

50:22.800 --> 50:25.300
PLANET-DESTROYING CONSPICUOUS

50:25.366 --> 50:26.866
CONSUMPTION AND PLANET SAVING

50:26.933 --> 50:29.166
RHETORIC IS BREATHTAKING.

50:29.233 --> 50:31.133
YOU SAY YOU LOVE GRETA AND HER

50:31.200 --> 50:32.133
MESSAGE, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE YOU

50:32.200 --> 50:34.266
LOVE IS A CLIMATE DISASTER.

50:34.333 --> 50:36.366
FAR FROM REJECTING CONSUMERISM,

50:36.433 --> 50:38.466
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO OBSESSED

50:38.533 --> 50:40.633
WITH LABELS THAT VENERABLE

50:40.700 --> 50:42.633
FASHION HOUSES LIKE BALENCIAGA

50:42.700 --> 50:44.966
HAVE PIVOTED FROM SELLING

50:45.033 --> 50:45.900
COUTURE DRESSES TO RICH WOMEN,

50:45.966 --> 50:46.766
TO SELLING BASEBALL HATS TO

50:46.833 --> 50:48.833
TEENAGERS.

50:48.900 --> 50:51.266
AND WHERE DOES A 20-SOMETHING

50:51.333 --> 50:53.033
GET THE MONEY TO PAY $400 FOR A

50:53.100 --> 50:57.533
HAT THAT BORROWS THE BERNIE

50:57.600 --> 51:03.100
SANDERS LOGO BECAUSE YOU'RE

51:03.166 --> 51:03.366
[LAUGHTER]

51:03.433 --> 51:04.566
[APPLAUSE]

51:04.633 --> 51:07.900
LIKE, A SOCIALIST AND STUFF?

51:07.966 --> 51:09.700
FROM MOMMY AND DADDY OF COURSE,

51:09.766 --> 51:10.966
THOSE HUGE ASSHOLES WHO RUINED

51:11.033 --> 51:13.600
THE PLANET.

51:13.666 --> 51:15.633
OH, AND ALSO MAYBE, BY TRADING

51:15.700 --> 51:17.066
BITCOIN, THE MINING OF WHICH IS

51:17.133 --> 51:18.066
WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN

51:18.133 --> 51:21.066
ACTUAL MINING.

51:21.133 --> 51:23.566
CRYPTOCURRENCY USES MORE ENERGY

51:23.633 --> 51:25.500
THAN NETFLIX, APPLE, FACEBOOK,

51:25.566 --> 51:27.666
MICROSOFT AND GOOGLE COMBINED,

51:27.733 --> 51:29.700
AND MORE THAN SOME ENTIRE

51:29.766 --> 51:32.266
NATIONS, AND YET YOUNG PEOPLE

51:32.333 --> 51:38.966
COULDN'T LOVE IT MORE IF IT CAME

51:39.033 --> 51:42.700
WITH A SIDE OF AVOCADO TOAST.

51:42.766 --> 51:42.966
[LAUGHTER]

51:43.033 --> 51:43.533
[APPLAUSE]

51:43.600 --> 51:45.666
94% OF CRYPTO BUYERS ARE EITHER

51:45.733 --> 51:47.200
MILLENNIALS OR GEN Z, WHICH

51:47.266 --> 51:48.666
MAKES IT RING A LITTLE HOLLOW

51:48.733 --> 51:50.033
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE CHANTING

51:50.100 --> 51:51.633
FOR US TO "PUT THE PLANET AHEAD

51:51.700 --> 51:53.600
OF PROFITS."

51:53.666 --> 51:54.700
AND WHAT DO CRYPTO FANS SAY

51:54.766 --> 51:56.600
ABOUT THIS?

51:56.666 --> 51:57.766
THEY SAY, "WELL YES, IT USES TOO

51:57.833 --> 51:59.666
MUCH ENERGY NOW, BUT IN THE

51:59.733 --> 52:00.900
FUTURE."

52:00.966 --> 52:02.833
AH YES, THE FUTURE.

52:02.900 --> 52:04.833
SAME THING MY GENERATION SAID:

52:04.900 --> 52:05.633
LET THEM HANDLE IT IN THE

52:05.700 --> 52:07.200
FUTURE.

52:07.266 --> 52:10.200
I'LL GET MINE NOW.

52:10.266 --> 52:12.200
LIKE BITCOIN, THE SMARTPHONE IS

52:12.266 --> 52:14.100
A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO CARBON

52:14.166 --> 52:17.133
EMISSIONS, BECAUSE THE CLOUD

52:17.200 --> 52:18.600
ISN'T AN ACTUAL CLOUD, OF COURSE

52:18.666 --> 52:20.800
IT'S A VAST NETWORK OF SERVERS

52:20.866 --> 52:21.833
USING ENERGY, AND ALL THAT

52:21.900 --> 52:22.900
LIKING, FOLLOWING, AND

52:22.966 --> 52:24.166
SUBSCRIBING REQUIRES LOTS OF

52:24.233 --> 52:26.833
FOSSIL FUELS.

52:26.900 --> 52:28.500
AND YET YOU'D NEED THE JAWS OF

52:28.566 --> 52:30.533
LIFE TO PRY A PHONE OUT OF THE

52:30.600 --> 52:37.833
HANDS OF ANYONE UNDER 30.

52:37.900 --> 52:39.200
[APPLAUSE]

52:39.266 --> 52:40.300
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO CONVINCE

52:40.366 --> 52:41.100
GEN Z AND MILLENNIALS TO GIVE UP

52:41.166 --> 52:43.700
THEIR PHONES?

52:43.766 --> 52:46.300
A POLLSTER ONCE ASKED THAT: 43%

52:46.366 --> 52:47.900
SAID IT WOULD TAKE $5 MILLION.

52:47.966 --> 52:50.733
TO GIVE UP THEIR PHONE.

52:50.800 --> 52:52.466
ONE IN TEN SAID THEY'D SACRIFICE

52:52.533 --> 52:56.000
A FINGER FOR IT.

52:56.066 --> 53:03.166
THAT DESERVES A "HIGH FOUR."

53:03.233 --> 53:03.433
[LAUGHTER]

53:03.500 --> 53:04.300
[APPLAUSE]

53:04.366 --> 53:09.033
I KNOW IT WOULD BE FIRE TO BE

53:09.100 --> 53:11.133
ABLE TO BOTH LIVE LIKE KYLIE AND

53:11.200 --> 53:12.566
ALSO SAVE THE PLANET, BUT YOU

53:12.633 --> 53:14.566
CAN'T DO BOTH.

53:14.633 --> 53:16.300
LAST YEAR WHEN AUSTRALIA WAS

53:16.366 --> 53:23.000
DEVASTATED BY WILDFIRES, GRETA

53:23.066 --> 53:24.766
REMINDED US THAT "WE STILL

53:24.833 --> 53:25.700
FAIL TO MAKE THE CONNECTION

53:25.766 --> 53:26.566
BETWEEN THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND

53:26.633 --> 53:30.433
INCREASED EXTREME WEATHER

53:30.500 --> 53:31.033
EVENTS. "

53:31.100 --> 53:31.900
KYLIE TOO WAS MOVED BY

53:31.966 --> 53:32.666
THE DISASTER AND TWEETED ABOUT

53:32.733 --> 53:33.666
HOW THE LOSS OF ANIMAL LIFE

53:33.733 --> 53:34.466
BREAKS HER HEART.

53:34.533 --> 53:35.333
THEN SHE QUICKLY FOLLOWED UP

53:35.400 --> 53:36.366
WITH A POST OF HER NEW, $1500

53:36.433 --> 53:40.033
LOUIS VUITTON MINK SLIPPERS.

53:40.100 --> 53:44.366
IT'S ALWAYS SO SAD WHEN FIRE

53:44.433 --> 53:46.966
KILLS POTENTIAL SLIPPERS.

53:47.033 --> 53:53.100
[LAUGHTER]

53:53.166 --> 53:53.966
KIDS, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE

53:54.033 --> 53:54.866
A CHOICE HERE: DO YOU WANT TO BE

53:54.933 --> 53:56.200
PROGRESSIVE OR EXCESSIVE?

53:56.266 --> 54:00.133
TEAM DRASTIC OR TEAM PLASTIC?

54:00.200 --> 54:02.900
WHEN KYLIE'S LIFESTYLE BECOMES

54:02.966 --> 54:04.500
UNCOOL AND UNPOPULAR, AND YOU

54:04.566 --> 54:05.866
STOP LOVING BITCOIN AND STOP

54:05.933 --> 54:07.400
THINKING THAT STUFFING YOUR FACE

54:07.466 --> 54:09.333
IS HARMLESS, I'LL TAKE YOU

54:09.400 --> 54:10.900
SERIOUSLY -- UNTIL THEN, SHUT UP

54:10.966 --> 54:12.133
ABOUT HOW OLDER GENERATIONS

54:12.200 --> 54:19.400
RUINED THE PLANET.

54:19.466 --> 54:23.600
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

54:23.666 --> 54:24.833
WE GET IT -- BOOMERS DROPPED THE

54:24.900 --> 54:25.700
BALL ON THE ENVIRONMENT.

54:25.766 --> 54:26.866
WE DID.

54:26.933 --> 54:29.733
WE DROPPED IT LIKE IT WAS HOT.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.800
AND FOR THAT, I CAN ONLY SAY,

54:31.866 --> 54:34.266
"WHOOPS!"

54:34.333 --> 54:36.633
YEAH, WE DROPPED IT -- BUT HAVE

54:36.700 --> 54:38.600
YOU PICKED IT UP?

54:38.666 --> 54:39.933
I WISH YOUR GENERATION WAS

54:40.000 --> 54:41.933
BETTER THAN MINE, I REALLY DO --

54:42.000 --> 54:43.466
BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS, WE'RE

54:43.533 --> 54:45.433
COMPLETELY THE SAME -- LOTS OF

54:45.500 --> 54:48.733
TALK, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

54:48.800 --> 54:52.766
HOPELESSLY SEDUCED AND ADDICTED

54:52.833 --> 54:54.566
TO PIGGING OUT ON CONVENIENCE,

54:54.633 --> 54:56.800
LUXURY, AND CONSUMPTION.

54:56.866 --> 54:59.000
SO THAT'S IT.

54:59.066 --> 55:00.266
YOU CAN EITHER BE THE FAKE TITS

55:00.333 --> 55:02.300
AND PRIVATE JET GENERATION, OR

55:02.366 --> 55:03.600
THE ONE THAT SAVES THE PLANET.

55:03.666 --> 55:05.333
BUT YOU CAN'T BE BOTH.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.466
BECAUSE FAKE TITS ARE NOT

55:06.533 --> 55:09.166
BIODEGRADABLE.

55:09.233 --> 55:10.100
OKAY, THAT'S OUR SHOW.

55:10.166 --> 55:11.100
I'LL BE AT THE FOX THEATRE IN

55:11.166 --> 55:13.366

HERSHEY, PA, NOVEMBER 14TH.

55:18.733 --> 55:20.066
