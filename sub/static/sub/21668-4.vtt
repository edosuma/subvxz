00:00.575 --> 00:02.843
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.910 --> 00:04.444
<i>Look at all those red jackets.</i>
<i>It's like an army there.</i>

00:04.512 --> 00:06.046
When Chef Ramsay asked
for a volunteer

00:06.114 --> 00:08.664
to go to the blue team...
Who's volunteering?

00:08.665 --> 00:09.505
I am, chef.

00:09.506 --> 00:10.710
I enjoy working with guys.

00:10.711 --> 00:11.878
But Chef Ramsay chose...

00:11.946 --> 00:12.812
Natalie...

00:12.880 --> 00:14.381
Instead.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.549
Later, a fast and furious
mommy-and-me brunch...

00:16.617 --> 00:18.385
They're going
to bring you some food.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.619
Tested the kitchen's teamwork.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.021
Let's go, guys.
Bang it out.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.989
Let's do this.
Right now.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.025
The red team got bogged down,

00:25.092 --> 00:26.326
as the war between Carrie
and Elise continued.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.927
Carrie, you're running
around frazzled.

00:27.995 --> 00:28.828
I want to get
this done.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.497
Guys, pick it up.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.965
With Natalie organizing
the blue team...

00:32.033 --> 00:33.333
Come on, come on, come on.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.769
Talk to each other.
Talk to each other.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.270
They sailed to their
third-consecutive challenge win.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.773
Congratulations.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.641
Hello, ladies.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.209
At dinner service,
when the doors opened

00:43.277 --> 00:45.912
for family night...

00:45.980 --> 00:47.881
The red kitchen warriors
were at it again.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.582
Are you standing there
with your hands on your hip

00:49.650 --> 00:50.750
<i>while we're trying</i>
<i>to put this ticket out?</i>

00:50.818 --> 00:52.018
On the blue team,

00:52.086 --> 00:53.119
a lackluster performance
from...

00:53.187 --> 00:55.955
Chino, Chino, Chino!

00:56.023 --> 00:57.791
Didn't stop Will...

00:57.858 --> 00:59.759
Get your broccoli to go now.
Get your spinach going.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.695
From leading his team
to victory.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.029
Come on, guys.
Last ticket.
We got it.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.364
In the red kitchen,

01:04.432 --> 01:05.965
Amanda was completely lost

01:06.033 --> 01:07.400
on the fish station.
How long
for the first two bass?

01:07.468 --> 01:09.135
I forgot about it.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.037
Ugh.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.006
Carrie continued
to cause confusion.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.140
It's raw!
Raw!

01:14.208 --> 01:17.077
This is embarrassing!

01:17.144 --> 01:19.145
Get out of here,
all of you.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.814
And hang your heads in shame.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.982
Shut it down.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.051
Elise had Carrie
on the ropes.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.519
I called it. I said if Carrie's
on meat, we're .

01:26.587 --> 01:28.455
The I did!

01:28.522 --> 01:30.223
But Carrie pleaded her case
to Chef Ramsay.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.825
I want to prove to you
I am good enough.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.860
I love cooking.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.895
And ultimately it was...
Amanda.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.731
That saw her dream of becoming

01:37.798 --> 01:39.532
head chef at BLT Steak
in New York City

01:39.600 --> 01:42.969

And now the continuation
of <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

02:51.224 --> 02:53.959
I can't believe we lost somebody
with so much potential

02:54.027 --> 02:55.628
and kept baggage.

02:55.696 --> 02:57.897
I am in shock right now.

02:57.964 --> 02:59.532
I can't believe
Carrie's still here.

02:59.599 --> 03:02.101
It's just mind-boggling to me.

03:02.169 --> 03:06.439
This is up...

03:06.506 --> 03:08.074
Because he's kept somebody

03:08.141 --> 03:09.675
who sucks the worst
out of all of us.

03:09.743 --> 03:13.045
I bet you she won't slide past
the blade again,

03:13.113 --> 03:14.313
'cause she's
not gonna get better.

03:14.381 --> 03:17.183
<i>She sucks.</i>

03:17.250 --> 03:20.953
I am so over Elise
and her mouth and her attitude.

03:21.021 --> 03:22.621
I've had enough.

03:22.689 --> 03:24.757
She stood there and did nothing,
and she's still here.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.525
Her mouth
is gonna send her home.

03:26.593 --> 03:28.394
Chef Ramsay doesn't put up
with that crap.

03:28.462 --> 03:30.196
And Krupa had the nerve
to say anything.

03:30.263 --> 03:32.031
She's the second weakest link.
She's not gonna last.

03:32.099 --> 03:33.933
She's number two.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.202
You know what? I got one thing
to say to that--it.

03:36.269 --> 03:37.770
<i>Aah!</i>

03:37.838 --> 03:39.071
Elise does not know
how to shut up.

03:39.139 --> 03:40.339
Her attitude puts everybody off.

03:40.407 --> 03:42.575
Krupa, what are you doing?

03:42.642 --> 03:44.143
Moving out.
<i>Why?</i>

03:44.211 --> 03:46.445
Me and Elise have had a problem
from the get-go.

03:46.513 --> 03:48.581
She's had an issue with me
from day one.
How did I have
an issue?

03:48.648 --> 03:50.116
She has never said anything
about you.

03:50.183 --> 03:51.517
Never.
Really?

03:51.585 --> 03:53.619
'Cause she's said plenty
to my face.

03:53.687 --> 03:54.920
<i>I said her naan bread</i>
<i>was a piece of ,</i>

03:54.988 --> 03:56.956
and if that's
your signature dish

03:57.023 --> 03:58.657
and that's the best you got and
that's what represents you...

03:58.725 --> 03:59.892
Keep your opinions
to yourself.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.527
No! No!

04:01.595 --> 04:03.529
If you don't want
to hear other people's opinions,

04:03.597 --> 04:04.897
don't move in a house
with 14 other people.

04:04.965 --> 04:06.465
I'm moving over there,
right?

04:06.533 --> 04:08.234
I'm gonna be out
of your face, right?

04:08.301 --> 04:09.135
<i>I'm mad</i>
<i>about your attitude.</i>

04:09.202 --> 04:10.669
That's what I got mad about.

04:10.737 --> 04:12.571
No, you were mad
about your naan bread.

04:12.639 --> 04:13.506
<i>No, I got mad</i>
<i>about your attitude,</i>

04:13.573 --> 04:14.473
<i>your fake-ass attitude.</i>

04:14.541 --> 04:15.608
Because I told--
<i>aagh!</i>

04:15.675 --> 04:18.043
This is why I need
this room.

04:18.111 --> 04:20.779
She got her nerve.

04:20.846 --> 04:22.982
Are we gonna be able
to get a long?

04:28.288 --> 04:29.955
After a late night...

04:30.023 --> 04:32.024
Get everybody up.
Get up, guys. Get up!

04:32.092 --> 04:34.794
Sous chefs Scott and Andi
show up bright and early.

04:34.861 --> 04:36.829
You got overalls.
You have boots.

04:36.897 --> 04:38.931
<i>Everybody get dressed.</i>
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

04:38.999 --> 04:40.733
With special gear
for today's challenge.

04:40.801 --> 04:42.835
<i>Can I get a yee-haw?</i>

04:42.903 --> 04:44.336
Come on,
everybody downstairs.

04:44.404 --> 04:46.238
Go, go, go, go.

04:46.306 --> 04:47.406
Yee-haw!

04:47.474 --> 04:48.541
Let's go, guys.

04:50.477 --> 04:52.678
Good morning.
Good morning, Chef.

04:52.746 --> 04:54.146
<i>Okay, as you can see,</i>

04:54.214 --> 04:56.515
we have a chicken delivery
this morning.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.317
Are you ready
to unload the truck?

04:58.385 --> 05:00.186
Yes, Chef.
Thanks, driver.

05:00.253 --> 05:01.754
Lucky for you,
you don't have to.

05:08.728 --> 05:10.896
Today you're gonna get
up close and personal

05:10.964 --> 05:13.966
with a key ingredient--
a chicken.

05:14.034 --> 05:16.735
Man, I'm from Jersey.
We don't chase chickens

05:16.803 --> 05:18.003
where I come from.

05:18.071 --> 05:19.505
We chase chicks.
Mm.

05:19.573 --> 05:22.174
For today's challenge,
each team will produce

05:22.242 --> 05:25.311
<i>four chicken dishes.</i>

05:25.378 --> 05:27.646
To determine what ingredients
you're gonna be

05:27.714 --> 05:30.216
lucky enough to use, each of you
will go into that pen,

05:30.283 --> 05:33.118
<i>grab a chicken,</i>
<i>deposit it into your bin,</i>

05:33.186 --> 05:36.755
<i>and then run to the board</i>
<i>and select an ingredient.</i>

05:36.823 --> 05:39.658
The key is to get
as many ingredients

05:39.726 --> 05:41.594
<i>in five minutes</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

05:41.661 --> 05:43.629
Everybody ready?
Yes, Chef.

05:43.697 --> 05:44.730
I think today
is, like, our day.

05:44.798 --> 05:46.332
We haven't won a challenge yet.

05:46.399 --> 05:48.133
We really need
to step it up now,

05:48.201 --> 05:49.468
and we need
to win a challenge.

05:49.536 --> 05:51.003
Five minutes...

05:51.071 --> 05:52.872
Starts now.

05:52.939 --> 05:56.408
In today's challenge...

05:56.476 --> 05:59.578
The chefs must race to catch
as many chickens as they can.

05:59.646 --> 06:02.314
I'm from Tennessee, dude.
I know how to catch chickens.

06:02.382 --> 06:04.216
It's a talent.
Come on, Jamie, go!

06:04.284 --> 06:05.451
The more chickens they catch...

06:05.519 --> 06:08.287
I got almonds.
Almonds!

06:08.355 --> 06:10.489
The more ingredients
they'll have to use

06:10.557 --> 06:11.557
when they're making
their four chicken dishes.

06:11.625 --> 06:12.992
Tomatoes!

06:14.628 --> 06:16.095
Agh!

06:16.162 --> 06:18.230
Go get 'em, monty!
Choke the chicken.

06:18.298 --> 06:19.999
This is like off a scene
of <i>Rocky</i> right now.

06:21.968 --> 06:23.269
If Sylvester Stallone
can catch a chicken,

06:23.336 --> 06:25.070
I can catch a chicken.

06:25.138 --> 06:27.940
These chickens
is fast.

06:29.075 --> 06:30.709
Pineapple.
Yeah!

06:30.777 --> 06:32.278
<i>Come on!</i>

06:32.345 --> 06:34.113
<i>Come on, Jamie!</i>

06:34.180 --> 06:36.048
Kentucky farm girl Natalie

06:36.116 --> 06:38.150
has no problem
diving into the competition...

06:39.219 --> 06:41.086
Coconut milk.

06:41.154 --> 06:44.356
While her teammate...
Come on, Chino.

06:44.424 --> 06:46.325
<i>There you go!</i>

06:46.393 --> 06:48.127
Shows off some cowboy skills
of his own.

06:48.194 --> 06:50.062
Chino might not be
the strongest cook we got here,

06:50.130 --> 06:51.397
but damn it,
can he choke a chicken.

06:53.233 --> 06:56.435
City slickers Krupa...

06:56.503 --> 06:58.804
And Gina...

06:58.872 --> 07:01.807
Aren't afraid to mix it up
with the chickens.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.642
Radish!
19 seconds to go.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.377
Come on!
And both teams wrangle

07:05.445 --> 07:06.979
enough chickens to complete
the first part

07:07.047 --> 07:08.647
of the challenge.

07:08.715 --> 07:10.049
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

07:10.116 --> 07:12.451
And stop.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.019
<i>Well done.</i>

07:14.087 --> 07:15.321
<i>Ladies, nine ingredients.</i>

07:15.388 --> 07:16.922
Blue team,
11 ingredients.

07:16.990 --> 07:18.791
Good job.
Everybody happy?

07:18.858 --> 07:20.626
Yes, Chef.
Go and get changed.

07:20.694 --> 07:21.860
<i>And I'll see you in five.</i>

07:21.928 --> 07:23.195
<i>Let's go.</i>

07:23.263 --> 07:24.229
Yes, Chef.

07:25.632 --> 07:27.533
After a quick clean

07:27.601 --> 07:29.501
and a quick change...
Scott and Andi,

07:29.569 --> 07:31.604
<i>bring out</i>
<i>the chicken, please.</i>

07:31.671 --> 07:35.674
As you can see, you only have
one lonely chicken.

07:35.742 --> 07:38.577
<i>When you cut that chicken up,</i>
<i>make sure you have</i>

07:38.645 --> 07:41.080
a portion that is good enough
to show off that dish.

07:41.147 --> 07:43.215
<i>You've all got 30 minutes,</i>

07:43.283 --> 07:45.584
starting from now.

07:45.652 --> 07:48.153
The teams will cook
their four dishes in pairs.

07:48.221 --> 07:50.856
Who's frying?
We are.
We need a breast, please.

07:50.924 --> 07:52.858
Chef Ramsay wants each pair
using a different technique.

07:52.926 --> 07:56.061
They will either grill,
saute, roast, or fry.

07:56.129 --> 07:57.463
I'm putting
a little more salt.

07:57.530 --> 07:59.198
No.

07:59.265 --> 08:01.033
And they're
only permitted to use

08:01.101 --> 08:02.134
the ingredients
selected earlier.

08:02.202 --> 08:03.135
Is that
the chicken in, Carrie?

08:03.203 --> 08:04.503
Chicken's in.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.772
Chef Ramsay teamed me up
with Gina,

08:06.840 --> 08:10.643
which I'm super excited about,
and we have fried chicken. Yeah.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.778
Super easy.
We're gonna knock this one out.

08:12.846 --> 08:14.780
All right, Gina,
what do you think, baby?

08:14.848 --> 08:18.017
That look pretty?
Does that look pretty? Gina?

08:18.084 --> 08:19.818
Yes.
Make sure it's done
in the center.

08:19.886 --> 08:21.453
All right.

08:21.521 --> 08:23.555
Ten minutes gone.
Just under 20 minutes to go.

08:23.623 --> 08:25.190
<i>Watch that chicken.</i>

08:25.258 --> 08:26.525
I'm on it. I just turned it.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.193
All right, brother.
I'm on it.

08:28.261 --> 08:29.762
I knew exactly what I wanted
to do with the dish.

08:29.829 --> 08:31.864
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

08:31.931 --> 08:33.065
I cooked the bacon on the grill,
the garbanzo beans on the grill,

08:33.133 --> 08:34.198
everything on the grill.

08:34.267 --> 08:35.433
Yes, it's done.
Take it off.

08:35.501 --> 08:36.934
<i>How you want me to cut it?</i>

08:37.003 --> 08:38.136
Make it look good.

08:38.203 --> 08:40.905
!

08:42.876 --> 08:44.275
Relax, relax.

08:44.344 --> 08:45.911
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe this.

08:45.979 --> 08:48.347
The breast falls
on the floor.

08:48.415 --> 08:49.982
We don't even have
enough chicken

08:50.050 --> 08:50.749
to even put
on a plate.

08:50.817 --> 08:51.784
Cannot use it.

08:51.851 --> 08:53.018
Chill out.
Chill out.

08:53.086 --> 08:54.953
My fault.
My fault.

08:55.021 --> 08:57.156
While Monterray and Tommy
try to work

08:57.223 --> 08:58.590
with what they have left,
over in the red kitchen...

08:58.658 --> 09:00.626
Carrie,
how's the chicken doing?

09:00.694 --> 09:02.428
<i>Oh, it's still a little raw.</i>

09:02.495 --> 09:04.763
Carrie makes a grim discovery.

09:04.831 --> 09:06.432
<i>Carrie!</i>
It's a little raw.

09:06.499 --> 09:07.299
I got to finish it off
in the oven?

09:07.367 --> 09:08.901
Yes. Yes.
Okay.

09:08.968 --> 09:11.003
It was raw. That much of it in
the center was raw.

09:11.071 --> 09:12.337
Really?

09:12.405 --> 09:14.306
There's no way
that's gonna be done.

09:14.374 --> 09:16.108
<i>Just leave it in there.</i>

09:16.176 --> 09:17.943
One minute to go.
Come on.

09:18.011 --> 09:19.812
Come on. Get our chicken.
Get our chicken.

09:19.879 --> 09:22.481
We got to cut it.
Let's go. Come on.

09:22.549 --> 09:23.882
, Carrie!

09:23.950 --> 09:28.721
Three, two, one,
and stop.

09:28.788 --> 09:32.891
Gina, I did everything
I was supposed to do.

09:32.959 --> 09:34.860
This is so embarrassing.

09:34.928 --> 09:36.895
You don't know what you're doing
if you're cooking chicken

09:36.963 --> 09:38.864
and it's that raw
in the center.

09:38.932 --> 09:40.265
<i>Okay.</i>

09:40.333 --> 09:41.900
Everybody confident
in their dishes?

09:41.968 --> 09:44.603
<i>Gina, first of all,</i>
<i>you're shaking your head.</i>

09:44.671 --> 09:46.105
Talk to me honestly.

09:46.172 --> 09:48.674
Chef, honestly,
our chicken's raw.

09:48.742 --> 09:50.442
What?

09:50.510 --> 09:51.510
Our chicken is raw.

09:51.578 --> 09:52.778
Why is it raw?

09:52.846 --> 09:54.346
We fried it,
put it in the oven.

09:54.414 --> 09:56.348
Carrie--
I'm talking.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.083
Carrie cooked the chicken.

09:58.151 --> 10:00.252
<i>She didn't have it</i>
<i>in the fryer long enough,</i>

10:00.320 --> 10:01.487
<i>and it didn't have long enough</i>
<i>to finish in the oven.</i>

10:01.554 --> 10:03.255
So it's raw.

10:03.323 --> 10:06.291
Come on, ladies.
I can't believe that.

10:06.359 --> 10:07.960
What's going on there,
Elise?

10:08.027 --> 10:09.294
I don't have anything
against anybody,

10:09.362 --> 10:12.464
but it seems
that the common denominator

10:12.532 --> 10:14.066
<i>is always Carrie.</i>

10:15.835 --> 10:17.369
Guess we're seeing time

10:17.437 --> 10:18.871
and time again
that everywhere Carrie goes,

10:18.938 --> 10:20.305
it's horrendous.

10:20.373 --> 10:22.441
Listen to me
and listen carefully.

10:22.509 --> 10:23.976
I've got a couple of guests
coming in here,

10:24.043 --> 10:25.310
<i>so hold it together.</i>

10:25.378 --> 10:27.379
Yes, Chef.

10:27.447 --> 10:28.680
From <i>People</i> magazine,

10:28.748 --> 10:30.983
<i>senior writer Jen Garcia.</i>

10:32.819 --> 10:34.720
And from <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>,

10:34.788 --> 10:36.388
<i>editor Dave Karger.</i>

10:36.456 --> 10:37.823
Good to see you both.

10:37.891 --> 10:39.458
Welcome.
Welcome, welcome.

10:39.526 --> 10:40.759
Thanks for having us.
Please take a seat.

10:40.827 --> 10:43.395
By the way, the chef today
with the best dish

10:43.463 --> 10:46.899
<i>on the winning team</i>
<i>will be featured with me</i>

10:46.966 --> 10:48.634
in <i>People</i> magazine.

10:48.701 --> 10:51.537
I love that magazine.
I get it every week.

10:51.604 --> 10:54.039
Let's start off
with the battle

10:54.107 --> 10:56.642
of the fried, please.
<i>Let's go, Paul.</i>

10:56.709 --> 11:00.078
First up, Carrie and Gina
square off against Paul.

11:00.146 --> 11:01.914
<i>Gina, would you be so kind</i>
<i>to explain</i>

11:01.981 --> 11:03.382
to the guests
what happened, please?

11:03.449 --> 11:05.350
I was on the team
with Carrie,

11:05.418 --> 11:07.653
<i>and the chicken was</i>
<i>completely raw in the center.</i>

11:07.720 --> 11:10.255
I'm sorry, Chef.

11:10.323 --> 11:13.192
Get back in line, please.

11:13.259 --> 11:15.060
I'm humiliated
by our dish.

11:15.128 --> 11:18.363
But, Gina, she just wants
to throw me under the bus.

11:18.431 --> 11:20.098
It's so hard.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.466
I don't like girls.

11:23.269 --> 11:25.170
It's raw, Carrie.
Shut the up.

11:25.238 --> 11:26.872
Oh, it's really raw.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.240
Paul.
When I think
of fried chicken,

11:28.308 --> 11:29.708
I think Southern style,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.410
<i>so I made roasted corn,</i>

11:31.477 --> 11:32.778
<i>and then I made</i>
<i>a nice rosemary grit</i>

11:32.846 --> 11:34.146
<i>and just a basic gravy.</i>

11:34.214 --> 11:35.781
It's classic.
It's simple.

11:35.849 --> 11:37.683
<i>It tastes good.</i>
Thank you.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.651
It's not easy to eat, but it's
worth it once you get the taste.

11:39.719 --> 11:40.986
Thank you.

11:41.054 --> 11:42.721
Clearly no competition.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.022
<i>Anything has to be</i>
<i>better than raw chicken.</i>

11:44.090 --> 11:45.824
One-nil
to the blue.

11:45.892 --> 11:48.493
<i>Well done.</i>
<i>Good job.</i>
Thank you.

11:48.561 --> 11:51.363
Next we have the battle
of the saute.

11:51.431 --> 11:53.565
Next, Jennifer and Krupa
attempt to even the score,

11:53.633 --> 11:56.034
as their chicken cacciatore...

11:56.102 --> 11:57.903
It was a bit much
on the plate.

11:57.971 --> 11:59.338
<i>It's delicious.</i>

11:59.405 --> 12:01.707
It does taste
better than it looks.

12:01.774 --> 12:04.309
Faces Jonathon and Will's
lemon-herb sauteed chicken.

12:04.377 --> 12:05.777
It's beautiful.

12:05.845 --> 12:07.946
I could easily see this
on the page

12:08.014 --> 12:09.781
<i>of our magazine.</i>

12:09.849 --> 12:11.550
I'd like to give you both
a point.

12:11.618 --> 12:13.151
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>Great job.</i>

12:13.219 --> 12:15.220
<i>Let's go--</i>

12:15.288 --> 12:16.889
the battle
of the grilled chicken.

12:16.956 --> 12:18.390
Up next, it's Jamie

12:18.458 --> 12:20.092
versus Monterray and Tommy.

12:20.159 --> 12:22.961
If Jamie's
grilled chicken salad loses,

12:23.029 --> 12:24.963
the blue team will win.

12:25.031 --> 12:26.732
<i>What'd you think?</i>

12:26.799 --> 12:29.968
I think the flavors threw me off
a little bit.

12:30.036 --> 12:32.638
But the chicken's cooked
really well.

12:32.705 --> 12:34.172
<i>Overall, I did enjoy it.</i>

12:34.240 --> 12:36.541
Yeah. It is cooked
really perfectly.

12:36.609 --> 12:38.410
Thank you.

12:38.478 --> 12:39.878
Uh, Tommy.

12:39.946 --> 12:41.647
Not much chicken on there,
though.

12:41.714 --> 12:43.548
No. What happened
to the chicken, please?

12:43.616 --> 12:45.884
We had a slipup
on the cutting board,

12:45.952 --> 12:48.687
and the end piece fell.

12:48.755 --> 12:50.289
Onto the floor?
Yes.

12:50.356 --> 12:52.024
It's not on the plate.
Don't worry.

12:52.091 --> 12:54.960
Half the chicken is missing.

12:55.028 --> 12:57.496
Congratulations,
red team.

12:59.799 --> 13:01.333
<i>Well done.</i>

13:01.401 --> 13:03.635
It's all gonna come down
to the roast.

13:03.703 --> 13:05.470
With the score tied...

13:05.538 --> 13:06.571
<i>Come on.</i>
Let's go.

13:06.639 --> 13:08.240
<i>Come on, Elise.</i>

13:08.308 --> 13:09.875
The roasted chicken
will decide it all,

13:09.943 --> 13:13.412
as Elise and Elizabeth
take on Natalie and Chino.

13:13.479 --> 13:16.648
I have for you today
a succulent roasted chicken.

13:16.716 --> 13:18.483
It also has
a butternut-squash puree

13:18.551 --> 13:20.652
<i>and a Swiss chard sauteed</i>

13:20.720 --> 13:23.021
<i>with sweated onions</i>
<i>and garlic.</i>

13:23.089 --> 13:24.423
It's beautiful.

13:24.490 --> 13:25.991
The colors pop.
They really do.

13:26.059 --> 13:27.926
It looks like it could come
from a restaurant kitchen.

13:27.994 --> 13:29.828
Whose idea was it?
It was my idea, Chef.

13:31.597 --> 13:33.432
Whatever.

13:33.499 --> 13:35.767
She wanted
all the limelight on her,

13:35.835 --> 13:37.135
but it was 50/50.

13:37.203 --> 13:38.704
You don't like sharing,
do you?

13:38.771 --> 13:41.239
No.
No. Didn't think so.

13:41.307 --> 13:42.441
Um, Natalie, please.

13:42.508 --> 13:44.109
What I have for you all today

13:44.177 --> 13:48.146
is a roasted chicken
coconut curry soup.

13:48.214 --> 13:49.581
<i>It's delicious.</i>

13:49.649 --> 13:51.183
It was kind of unexpected
for me.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.985
Mmm.
<i>Pretty great.</i>

13:53.052 --> 13:54.252
<i>Oh, yeah, I have to agree.</i>

13:54.320 --> 13:55.721
I like that a lot.

13:55.788 --> 13:57.489
<i>The chicken</i>
<i>has a great spice to it.</i>

13:57.557 --> 13:59.624
You've nailed the chicken.

13:59.692 --> 14:01.026
Back in line, thank you,
while we have a little conflab.

14:01.094 --> 14:02.794
Thank you.

14:02.862 --> 14:05.330
Yeah, it's a tough one,
that one, very tough.

14:05.398 --> 14:07.699
We're on a winning streak,
and we're gonna walk out

14:07.767 --> 14:11.203
with the win today, man,
definitely.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.505
Okay, that was tough, 'cause it
was all down to the last dish.

14:13.573 --> 14:14.773
I'm sick of losing.

14:14.841 --> 14:16.375
I'm sick of doing punishments.

14:16.442 --> 14:18.910
I want to get out of this house
before I hurt somebody.

14:18.978 --> 14:21.279
We have to win this one.

14:21.347 --> 14:23.749
Congratulations goes to...

Advertise your product or brand here

14:32.553 --> 14:33.782
Today in a challenge

14:33.783 --> 14:35.750
that had the chefs
cooking chicken

14:35.818 --> 14:38.647
using four different techniques,
the teams are all tied up,

14:38.648 --> 14:41.616
and it comes down
to one last match.

14:41.684 --> 14:43.852
It's all down
to the last dish.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.620
Will it be Chino
and Natalie's curry chicken soup

14:45.688 --> 14:48.390
or Elizabeth and Elise's
succulent roasted chicken?

14:48.458 --> 14:50.192
<i>Congratulations goes to...</i>

14:50.259 --> 14:51.893
Red team.

14:51.961 --> 14:54.496
I won!
I'm so excited.

14:54.564 --> 14:56.698
I knew that my dish
was the best out there.

14:56.766 --> 14:58.467
First challenge won--
good job, guys.

14:58.534 --> 15:00.602
Me and Elizabeth's dish.

15:00.670 --> 15:03.338
Okay, in spite
of a disastrous start,

15:03.406 --> 15:04.740
you get to fly the coop.

15:04.807 --> 15:05.941
Yes!

15:06.009 --> 15:07.242
And you'll be spending
all day

15:07.310 --> 15:10.712
<i>go-carting at K1 Speedway.</i>

15:10.780 --> 15:13.415
I cannot wait
to go go-carting!

15:13.483 --> 15:14.549
Yay!

15:14.617 --> 15:17.319
The best dish,
the one that had

15:17.387 --> 15:19.588
<i>the visual impact,</i>
<i>belongs to...</i>

15:19.655 --> 15:20.922
Elise and Elizabeth.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.591
<i>Well done.</i>

15:22.658 --> 15:24.693
I cannot believe

15:24.761 --> 15:27.396
that we are gonna be
in a magazine.

15:27.463 --> 15:29.431
This is everything
I ever wanted

15:29.499 --> 15:33.468
out of life.

15:33.536 --> 15:35.103
<i>A round of applause</i>
<i>for the judges, please.</i>

15:36.305 --> 15:37.572
Thank you.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.408
<i>Okay, red team,</i>

15:39.475 --> 15:41.143
get out of here.
We're going out. We won.

15:41.210 --> 15:42.677
Good job, guys.

15:43.846 --> 15:45.580
Yes!
Oh, my God.

15:45.648 --> 15:46.982
This is the best day
of my life.

15:47.050 --> 15:48.316
Okay, blue team,

15:48.384 --> 15:50.052
<i>whilst the red team</i>

15:50.119 --> 15:52.521
will be breaking
land-speed records today,

15:52.588 --> 15:54.556
<i>you'll be cooped up today.</i>

15:54.624 --> 15:57.726
You'll all be working with,
you guessed it, chicken.

15:57.794 --> 16:01.296
I want the most amazing
80-quart chicken stock,

16:01.364 --> 16:02.364
<i>beautifully done.</i>

16:02.432 --> 16:03.932
Clean out the carcasses.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.767
<i>Peel onions,</i>
<i>and get that stock</i>

16:05.835 --> 16:07.969
absolutely stunning.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.307
It just kind of pisses me off

16:12.375 --> 16:14.609
that Carrie brought up
raw chicken today--raw.

16:14.677 --> 16:17.012
We shouldn't have lost.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.914
<i>We're gonna start off</i>
<i>making chicken stock, okay?</i>

16:18.981 --> 16:20.482
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:20.550 --> 16:23.685
I don't know if Elise
is gonna fit in that go cart

16:23.753 --> 16:25.654
with that head
of hers.

16:25.721 --> 16:27.122
They might have to get her
a bigger helmet or some .

16:27.190 --> 16:28.223
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

16:29.592 --> 16:31.226
Hey!

16:31.294 --> 16:33.595
<i>Bye, guys</i>
<i>bye, guys.</i>

16:33.663 --> 16:35.630
Don't wreck.
I mean, have fun.

16:35.698 --> 16:37.132
I will.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.667
You know they're gonna turn
that go-cart racing

16:38.734 --> 16:39.835
into bumper cars, right?

16:39.902 --> 16:41.236
Yeah, go-carting.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.004
I'm so happy
to get out of here.

16:43.072 --> 16:46.408
Bye-bye, Hell's Kitchen.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.343
Whoo!
Let's go.

16:51.881 --> 16:53.949
Hi, ladies.
Hi.

16:54.016 --> 16:56.351
Hope you guys are all ready
to have a great time today.

16:56.419 --> 16:58.653
We're gonna get suited up
and get ready to race, okay?

16:58.721 --> 17:00.889
So let's get going.

17:03.226 --> 17:06.595
I've never raced
a car before, never.

17:06.662 --> 17:08.930
But I am going to kick some butt
in go-carting.

17:16.138 --> 17:17.472
I love go-carting.

17:20.242 --> 17:23.444
We take off.
Each one of us slams on the gas.

17:23.512 --> 17:26.214
It was, like, a rush.

17:28.818 --> 17:30.886
I actually don't have a license.

17:30.953 --> 17:35.157
I'm from Manhattan,
New York.

17:35.224 --> 17:38.160
The go-carts
were really fast.

17:40.229 --> 17:41.730
It was kind of, like,
scary for me.

17:47.670 --> 17:49.738
I was freaked out.

17:51.941 --> 17:55.777
In my head, I was going
about 100 miles an hour.

17:55.845 --> 17:58.713
I guess I was driving
like Miss Daisy.

17:58.781 --> 18:01.349
While Jennifer takes her time
getting around the track,

18:01.417 --> 18:03.051
back in Hell's Kitchen...

18:03.119 --> 18:04.920
So you want me to go over
some menu items?

18:04.987 --> 18:06.688
The blue team is looking
to make good use

18:06.756 --> 18:08.423
of their time together
in the kitchen.

18:08.491 --> 18:10.058
Yeah, why don't we go
over it again,

18:10.126 --> 18:11.693
<i>guys,</i>
<i>since we're standing here?</i>

18:11.761 --> 18:12.794
<i>We might as well occupy</i>
<i>our time in the right way.</i>

18:12.862 --> 18:13.862
All right.
Order in.

18:13.930 --> 18:15.597
<i>Squab, risotto, scallop, tart.</i>

18:15.665 --> 18:17.699
Entree--Wellington, cod,
strip, and bass.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.834
Rice is going.
Scallop.

18:19.902 --> 18:22.170
Starting to go, starting to go,
starting to go.

18:22.238 --> 18:23.972
We had our first two services--
it was a loss, and it sucked.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.607
Doing my fish thing.

18:25.675 --> 18:27.509
We got an opportunity

18:27.577 --> 18:28.810
to work out any kinks that we
might have seen in service.

18:28.878 --> 18:30.278
Three minutes out.

18:30.346 --> 18:33.148
Now I'm gonna say,
"Okay, dude, it's not ready.

18:33.216 --> 18:34.950
"So it's still in the oven.

18:35.017 --> 18:36.484
<i>So, hey, you got to give me</i>
<i>four minutes."</i>

18:36.552 --> 18:38.386
No, that's not good.

18:38.454 --> 18:40.055
How long?

18:40.122 --> 18:42.090
You got to give me
four minutes, dude.

18:42.158 --> 18:45.694
Chino sat there
and was like--

18:45.761 --> 18:47.629
okay, three minutes--

18:47.697 --> 18:49.297
<i>three minutes--</i>
<i>three minutes!</i>

18:49.365 --> 18:51.733
He can't even fake
being a good cook.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.101
So I need two minutes.

18:53.169 --> 18:54.869
Well, say I'm behind again.

18:54.937 --> 18:57.239
I mean, really?
There's no cooking involved.

18:57.306 --> 18:59.040
I mean, how hard is that?

18:59.108 --> 19:01.276
That's it.
I'm just gonna try--
hurry up!

19:01.344 --> 19:03.345
Chino!

19:03.412 --> 19:05.146
While Chino puts the brakes

19:05.214 --> 19:06.548
on his team's
dinner rehearsal...

19:06.616 --> 19:08.683
Attention, ladies,
this is your final race.

19:08.751 --> 19:10.986
The red team is ready
to put the pedal to the metal.

19:11.053 --> 19:14.923
The final race is me, Elise,
and Carrie.

19:14.991 --> 19:17.859
The three of us
had the fastest times.

19:21.964 --> 19:23.231
No bumping!

19:23.299 --> 19:24.799
There was no way
I was gonna allow

19:24.867 --> 19:26.501
Carrie to win the race.

19:26.569 --> 19:28.270
I'm gonna run Carrie
off the road.

19:31.907 --> 19:32.941
Oh, my God!

19:33.009 --> 19:34.576
She --
I know.

19:34.644 --> 19:36.244
Elise is a freak
behind the wheel.

19:46.622 --> 19:48.423
If I can't win,
the next better woman in line

19:48.491 --> 19:49.457
to win it is Jamie.

19:50.993 --> 19:52.794
As long as Carrie didn't get
to have the trophy

19:52.862 --> 19:54.529
and try to find something
to brag about,

19:54.597 --> 19:57.866
I was okay.

19:57.933 --> 20:02.170
Continue winning challenges.

20:02.238 --> 20:04.005
With dinner service looming,

20:04.073 --> 20:05.707
the chefs are hard at work
preparing.

20:05.775 --> 20:07.642
Keep your head
on your shoulders.

20:07.710 --> 20:10.011
<i>Don't freak out.</i>
<i>We need to win, boys.</i>

20:10.079 --> 20:12.781
While the blue team
seems focused and united,

20:12.848 --> 20:13.882
in the red kitchen,
Elise...

20:13.949 --> 20:15.216
That's all we have?

20:15.284 --> 20:17.118
Yeah, that was everything
you gave us.

20:17.186 --> 20:19.187
That's why I put eight eggs
on there, 'cause it cooks down.

20:19.255 --> 20:21.222
Would you stop talking to me
like I'm your child?

20:21.290 --> 20:23.491
Has found
someone else to agitate.

20:23.559 --> 20:24.893
<i>Whatever.</i>

20:24.960 --> 20:26.428
You need to calm down.
I am calm.

20:26.495 --> 20:28.029
I'm just saying--
you're not.

20:28.097 --> 20:29.464
You're always talking back
to me,

20:29.532 --> 20:30.799
<i>and you don't need</i>
<i>to talk back to me.</i>

20:30.866 --> 20:32.100
I'm here.
You're here.

20:32.168 --> 20:33.935
Get it straight.

20:34.003 --> 20:35.737
Hello?
I heard you.

20:37.940 --> 20:40.041
You're so
disrespectful.

20:45.186 --> 20:47.387
It's less than 30 minutes
before the doors

20:47.455 --> 20:49.656
of Hell's Kitchen open,
and one chef on the red team...

20:50.058 --> 20:51.321
You need to calm down.

20:51.322 --> 20:52.155
I am calm.
I'm just saying--

20:52.203 --> 20:52.980
you're not.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.614
You're always talking back
to me,

20:54.682 --> 20:56.549
<i>and you don't need</i>
<i>to talk back to me.</i>

20:56.617 --> 20:57.717
Seems to have a problem
with authority.

20:57.785 --> 20:58.852
I'm here.
You're here.

20:58.919 --> 20:59.986
Get it straight.

21:00.054 --> 21:02.255
Hello?
I heard you.

21:02.323 --> 21:04.824
You're so
disrespectful.

21:04.892 --> 21:08.161
I think this is the first time
I smiled all day.

21:10.231 --> 21:11.798
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. James.

21:11.866 --> 21:13.299
Yes, Chef.
Let's go, please.

21:13.367 --> 21:14.367
Open Hell's Kitchen.
Yes, Chef.

21:26.614 --> 21:28.515
For tonight's dinner service,

21:28.582 --> 21:29.816
there will be extra pressure
on the chefs,

21:29.884 --> 21:32.352
as both teams
will have V.I.P. guests

21:32.420 --> 21:34.287
sitting at the chef's tables.

21:34.355 --> 21:36.690
World champion volleyball
players Misty May-Treanor

21:36.757 --> 21:39.426
and Jen Kessy will be dining
in the red kitchen...

21:39.493 --> 21:41.161
Ooh, I'm excited.

21:41.228 --> 21:43.163
While the blue kitchen
will play host

21:43.230 --> 21:45.565
to multi-olympic gold medalist
swimmers Janet Evans

21:45.633 --> 21:48.134
and Mark Spitz.

21:48.202 --> 21:50.437
So nice to see you both.
How are you, darling?

21:50.504 --> 21:52.338
Nice to meet you.
Welcome.
You both look great.

21:52.406 --> 21:53.907
Oh, we're all girls
on this side.

21:53.974 --> 21:55.542
All girls
on the red team.

21:55.609 --> 21:57.043
Tonight we had special guests
at the chef's table,

21:57.111 --> 21:58.545
which really puts on
the pressure,

21:58.612 --> 22:00.246
because the chef's table is so
close, they're watching you.

22:00.314 --> 22:01.781
I mean, it's different
when they're watching you

22:01.849 --> 22:03.483
from the dining room.

22:03.551 --> 22:05.452
We've got two olympic ladies
cheering for us over there.

22:05.519 --> 22:06.986
Come on.

22:07.054 --> 22:09.556
So, fingers crossed. Girl power.
Nice to see you both.

22:09.623 --> 22:11.357
<i>Krupa.</i>
Yes, Chef.

22:11.425 --> 22:12.926
You can host
the chef's table.

22:12.993 --> 22:14.728
Yes, Chef.
Oh, my God.

22:14.795 --> 22:17.297
I love them.
I saw them, well, not live,

22:17.364 --> 22:18.598
but on TV.
It was so awesome.

22:18.666 --> 22:20.667
Hi, ladies.

22:20.735 --> 22:23.169
I have to say congratulations.
And I think you're great.

22:23.237 --> 22:25.238
Come on.
Red team...

22:25.306 --> 22:26.840
<i>Two scallops,</i>
<i>one cioppino,</i>

22:26.907 --> 22:27.707
one cod,
one lamb, one Wellington.

22:27.775 --> 22:28.975
Yes, Chef.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.910
Let's go, Elise. Come on.
Yes, Chef.

22:30.978 --> 22:32.412
I'm feeling very confident
about dinner service

22:32.480 --> 22:34.948
because Carrie won't be
on meats.

22:35.015 --> 22:37.550
So tonight will go a lot better
than last service.

22:37.618 --> 22:39.886
I need four minutes.
Okay, four minutes.

22:39.954 --> 22:42.222
While Elise gets
the red team started

22:42.289 --> 22:44.190
on appetizers...
Okay, blue team, here we go.

22:44.258 --> 22:45.859
Chef Ramsay is ready

22:45.926 --> 22:47.460
with the blue team's
first ticket.

22:47.528 --> 22:49.496
One risotto, one Caesar salad,

22:49.563 --> 22:51.231
one lobster spaghetti.
Yes, Chef.

22:51.298 --> 22:52.565
Welcome.

22:52.633 --> 22:53.800
Hello, I'm Janet.
How are you, my darling?

22:53.868 --> 22:54.868
Good to see you.

22:54.935 --> 22:56.136
Welcome, Janet.
Nice to see you.

22:56.203 --> 22:57.737
Mark Spitz.
Both my wife and I

22:57.805 --> 22:59.105
<i>are big fans.</i>

22:59.173 --> 23:00.607
Thank you.
Please sit down.

23:00.674 --> 23:02.108
Hey, Jonathon,
you're on desserts,

23:02.176 --> 23:03.343
so it'll be easy for you
to look after them, yes?

23:03.410 --> 23:05.211
I'm a Mark Spitz fan, Chef.

23:05.279 --> 23:07.814
Janet Evans and Mark Spitz
at the chef's table.

23:07.882 --> 23:09.282
It was awesome.

23:09.350 --> 23:11.251
Gold medal service.
Let's go.

23:11.318 --> 23:12.685
I'm a big fan.
Hey, how you doing?

23:12.753 --> 23:14.654
And Mrs. Janet Evans.

23:14.722 --> 23:16.756
Could I get y'all anything
right now?

23:16.824 --> 23:18.158
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>Sure.</i>

23:18.225 --> 23:19.759
Back in the red kitchen...

23:19.827 --> 23:20.593
<i>Scallops--where are they?</i>

23:20.661 --> 23:22.529
Walking with scallops.

23:22.596 --> 23:24.964
Elise is ready
with her first appetizer.

23:25.032 --> 23:26.599
Elise.
Yes, Chef.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.334
I've got no color
on there.

23:28.402 --> 23:30.203
They're rubbery.
They're watery.

23:30.271 --> 23:31.704
wake up, Elise.

23:31.772 --> 23:33.173
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>
<i>Mix it with salt.</i>

23:33.240 --> 23:35.575
Don't turn them till
they're nice and golden.

23:35.643 --> 23:36.976
Chef Ramsay,
when he teaches,

23:37.044 --> 23:38.878
it's easy to learn from him.

23:38.946 --> 23:40.480
But if he teaches you something,
you better get it right.

23:40.548 --> 23:41.614
Scallops, please.

23:41.682 --> 23:42.782
Yes, Chef!

23:48.189 --> 23:50.190
Elise.
Yes, Chef.

23:50.257 --> 23:51.591
They're cooked perfectly.

23:51.659 --> 23:53.026
Thank you, Chef.

23:53.093 --> 23:54.561
I'm proud of myself.

23:54.628 --> 23:56.095
It started off rough,
but I recovered,

23:56.163 --> 23:57.964
and that's what's important.

23:58.032 --> 23:59.933
With Elise delivering

24:00.000 --> 24:02.502
gold medal scallops...
Come on, Tommy.

24:02.570 --> 24:05.271
Over in the blue kitchen...
Right behind you, Chef.

24:05.339 --> 24:07.373
Tommy is hoping to score
with his appetizer.

24:07.441 --> 24:09.042
Thank you, sir.

24:09.109 --> 24:10.743
Making Caesar salad--
so easy.

24:10.811 --> 24:11.678
Like, you know,
I knew she would like it.

24:11.745 --> 24:13.379
How is everything?

24:13.447 --> 24:15.882
Her dressing actually
was a little bit too saturated.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.951
Jonathon.

24:18.018 --> 24:19.452
My salad was, like,
soaking in dressing.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.054
How do you up salad?

24:21.121 --> 24:22.655
How hard
is that ?

24:22.723 --> 24:24.123
I'm just gonna make
a fresh salad.

24:24.191 --> 24:25.458
There's no sense
in this .

24:26.794 --> 24:28.161
Excuse my language.

24:28.229 --> 24:29.996
That's okay.
Scallops, how long?

24:30.064 --> 24:31.731
I need another Caesar
with a little less dressing.

24:35.569 --> 24:37.237
<i>Hey. Come here, you.</i>

24:37.304 --> 24:39.305
I'm pissed off you just throw it
in the trash.

24:39.373 --> 24:40.874
Miss Evans said her Caesar salad
was drowned in dressing.

24:40.941 --> 24:43.009
Who dressed
the Caesar salad?

24:43.077 --> 24:44.477
Who dressed it?

24:44.545 --> 24:45.745
I did.
Come here, you.

24:45.813 --> 24:48.581
You can't dress a salad?

24:48.649 --> 24:50.583
I can, Chef,
and I will do it right now.

24:50.651 --> 24:52.785
While Tommy takes another run

24:52.853 --> 24:55.088
at dressing the Caesar salad,
back in the red kitchen...

24:55.155 --> 24:57.657
How long
on your scallops, Elise?
Right now.

24:57.725 --> 24:59.859
Carrie is coordinating the times
for her team's appetizers.

24:59.927 --> 25:01.427
Let's go.

25:01.495 --> 25:03.863
What do you mean
"right now"?

25:03.931 --> 25:05.331
She said
she could bring it.

25:05.399 --> 25:06.799
Listen, don't ask her.
Ask me.

25:06.867 --> 25:08.101
Are you ready?

25:08.168 --> 25:09.435
Just give me two minutes.

25:09.503 --> 25:10.970
I'm walking with scallops.

25:11.038 --> 25:13.106
No, no.
Wow.

25:13.173 --> 25:15.174
Carrie calls it
and said we were ready to go up.

25:15.242 --> 25:16.542
Be quiet, Elise.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.579
Elise and Carrie fight,
no matter what.

25:19.647 --> 25:22.615
It really brings
the rest of us down.

25:22.683 --> 25:23.950
Okay, Elise,
you can go up now.

25:24.018 --> 25:25.551
No, we're not going up now,

25:25.619 --> 25:27.020
'cause I had to start
my scallops over.

25:27.087 --> 25:28.721
Oh, come on.

25:28.789 --> 25:31.557
Start your scallops.
Let's go. Come on.

25:31.625 --> 25:33.159
It's an hour
into dinner service,

25:33.227 --> 25:34.761
and thanks to Natalie...

25:34.828 --> 25:37.230
Come on, guys.
Keep talking to each other.

25:37.298 --> 25:38.965
The blue team has delivered
most of their appetizers.

25:39.033 --> 25:41.100
Mmm.
I like it.

25:41.168 --> 25:43.736
And now Chef Ramsay is looking
to Monterray

25:43.804 --> 25:45.138
to deliver the first entrees.

25:45.205 --> 25:47.206
Cod, bass.
Ahh.

25:47.274 --> 25:48.574
, .

25:48.642 --> 25:50.209
The sea bass is
falling apart.

25:50.277 --> 25:51.778
Sea bass is what?
The sea bass fell apart.

25:51.845 --> 25:53.379
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

25:53.447 --> 25:55.481
When you take the fish
out of the pan,

25:55.549 --> 25:57.417
you leave it
on the spatula.

25:57.484 --> 25:59.285
It fell apart. There's nothing
I can do--it fell apart.

25:59.353 --> 26:00.753
Leave it
on the spatula.

26:00.821 --> 26:02.121
<i>Is that what you did?</i>

26:02.189 --> 26:03.623
No, it's not--
no, you didn't.

26:03.691 --> 26:05.091
So it's
the fish's fault again?

26:05.159 --> 26:06.793
No, it's not.
It fell apart.

26:06.860 --> 26:08.094
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>
<i>It fell apart.</i>

26:08.162 --> 26:09.729
There is something
you can do,

26:09.797 --> 26:12.732
because you should be
Responsible enough to care!

26:12.800 --> 26:14.534
You're gonna lie
to my face

26:14.601 --> 26:16.569
<i>and tell me</i>
<i>there's nothing you can do!</i>

26:16.637 --> 26:18.271
I understand what he's telling
me, and I'm listening to him,

26:18.339 --> 26:19.806
but you ain't gonna keep
cussing at me.

26:19.873 --> 26:21.474
I don't give a
who you are--

26:21.542 --> 26:22.809
Chef Ramsay, Chef Scott,
Chef Andi.

26:22.876 --> 26:24.010
You ain't gonna keep talking
to me like that.

26:24.078 --> 26:25.578
So don't sit here
and me

26:25.646 --> 26:27.013
<i>and tell me that</i>
<i>there's nothing you can do!</i>

26:27.081 --> 26:29.082
You're giving up.

26:29.149 --> 26:30.717
Shut up!

26:39.219 --> 26:41.166
It's an hour and a half
into dinner service.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.635
So don't sit here and tell me
that there's nothing you can do!

26:43.702 --> 26:45.670
You're giving up.
You up.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.338
Shut up!

26:47.406 --> 26:49.174
And Monterray has decided

26:49.241 --> 26:50.275
to go toe-to-toe
with sous chef Scott.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.177
Alls you have to do
is bring it up.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.378
And it won't break.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.746
I understand.
Do you?

26:54.813 --> 26:56.080
I'm positive.
Then do it.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.449
Then do it.
you.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.285
Well, you,
too, then.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.323
When you got too much pride
and you want to stand there

27:05.391 --> 27:07.492
and cuss
Chef Scott,

27:07.560 --> 27:09.260
that's the
that needs to go home.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.095
Pass me some
goose necks, please.

27:11.163 --> 27:13.164
Just shut him down and send
his ass home right now.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.966
That's a done deal.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.568
You want me
to cut the Wellington?

27:16.635 --> 27:17.602
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>
All right.

27:17.670 --> 27:18.703
Pass me a goose neck.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.104
<i>I can't do everything</i>

27:20.172 --> 27:21.105
for everybody,
damn it.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.273
I'm helping everybody I can.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.242
Man up
and man your station.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.146
<i>Get the out of here.</i>

27:28.214 --> 27:29.380
Whatever, man.
You're the float. Float.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.648
Jon was floating.
If you're floating,

27:30.716 --> 27:32.784
you float,
and you help everybody.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.686
That's what
a float does.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.454
Hey, if you're gonna quit,
then just quit now.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.422
<i>How about that?</i>

27:39.491 --> 27:40.925
<i>Guys, stop,</i>

27:40.993 --> 27:42.860
get on your stations,
and start the damn food.

27:42.928 --> 27:44.696
Start the food,
and that's it.

27:44.763 --> 27:46.664
I'm doing everything
I can do.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.566
Dude, you're working desserts.
You man the up.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.235
You have time to yell at each
other, but not time to cook.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.269
<i>Guys, guys, guys.</i>

27:51.337 --> 27:52.570
Stop.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.339
Personally, I'd love
to watch them both

27:54.406 --> 27:56.040
beat the
out of each other.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.476
However, we got Mark Spitz
and Janet Evans in the kitchen--

27:58.544 --> 28:01.312
two olympic
gold medalist swimmers.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.780
And people are gonna argue?

28:02.848 --> 28:04.649
It's embarrassing.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.618
Two hours into dinner service...

28:06.685 --> 28:08.753
Hot. Hot.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.888
Go, please, yeah?

28:10.956 --> 28:12.790
The red team has finally
delivered all their appetizers

28:12.858 --> 28:13.558
to their hungry diners...

28:13.626 --> 28:15.260
They're finally here.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.228
Okay, bon appetit.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.364
And is in the process
of sending out entrees.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.832
Oh, hold on.
Hey, stop.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.333
Have you sliced
the New York strip?

28:22.401 --> 28:24.235
Yes, Chef.
Oh, my God.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.437
Gina.
You don't slice it
until when, Gina?

28:26.505 --> 28:28.139
Till you're ready
to walk.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.874
So is the bass ready?
I'm nowhere near ready.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.843
Oh, my God.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.711
How long do you need
on your bass, Elise?

28:33.779 --> 28:35.380
I need at least seven minutes.

28:35.447 --> 28:36.581
<i>Well done.</i>

28:36.649 --> 28:38.616
Well done.

28:38.684 --> 28:40.285
You think it's funny, Gina?

28:40.352 --> 28:41.686
I don't think it's funny
at all, Chef.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.588
I was like,
"get me out of here."

28:43.656 --> 28:46.057
Like, I wish I could have
just disappeared and been, like,

28:46.125 --> 28:47.725
sitting in a bubble bath
somewhere,

28:47.793 --> 28:49.160
drinking champagne.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.328
Come on, ladies,
get it together.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.663
Yes, Chef.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.597
While Gina has stalled

28:52.665 --> 28:54.232
the red kitchen...

28:54.300 --> 28:55.900
We got to get our timing
together, ladies, seriously.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.635
In the blue kitchen,

28:57.703 --> 28:59.604
Monterray has finally sent
an acceptable sea bass.

28:59.672 --> 29:01.072
Let's go.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.374
Really good.
Okay, let's go.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.910
Chef's table--
one lamb, one Wellington.
Yes, Chef!

29:05.978 --> 29:07.645
Now it's up to Chino

29:07.713 --> 29:09.247
on the meat station
to get entrees out

29:09.315 --> 29:11.249
to the Olympians.
Let's go, Chino.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.950
Yes, Chef.
<i>You got to let will know</i>

29:13.018 --> 29:13.785
when you're gonna have
all that up.

29:13.852 --> 29:15.086
One minute out.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.587
One minute out,
walking garnish.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.523
I was going over there
to help Chino.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.158
I got it.
I got it.

29:20.225 --> 29:21.726
You know, try to communicate
with the kitchen

29:21.794 --> 29:23.261
what the times were
for his meat.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.496
Chino, how long
until it's ready?

29:25.564 --> 29:27.298
It's gonna be
three more minutes, Chef.

29:27.366 --> 29:30.134
You need three minutes?

29:30.202 --> 29:32.036
"Give me a minute.
Give me a minute."

29:32.104 --> 29:33.705
You mean a actual minute,
like, 60 seconds?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.306
"Oh, I need three minutes."

29:35.374 --> 29:36.507
So...

29:36.575 --> 29:38.076
I'm sorry.
A minute--

29:38.143 --> 29:39.277
yeah, it's gonna be a minute.
I'm sorry.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.978
Like, one minute?

29:41.046 --> 29:43.481
Yeah, I thought it was gonna be
a minute, but I was wrong.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.817
Yes, I understand that,
but you have to call real time.
I was wrong.

29:45.884 --> 29:48.152
You don't need to preach to me,
okay, so it doesn't help.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.821
It doesn't help.
Okay?

29:49.888 --> 29:51.155
Just go away.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.724
<i>Wellington.</i>

29:52.791 --> 29:53.925
I just want to put up the food.
What is that?

29:53.992 --> 29:57.295
Cold, too, ice cold.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.163
<i>Chino!</i>

30:00.899 --> 30:03.000
All of you,
come here.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.702
Just touch that.
Touch the meat.

30:04.770 --> 30:08.072
Touch the meat.
It's raw.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.307
Raw!

30:09.375 --> 30:11.309
Come on.
We got to get it together.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.444
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

30:13.512 --> 30:14.879
While Chino starts over
on the special guests' entrees,

30:14.947 --> 30:16.447
in the red kitchen...

30:16.515 --> 30:17.682
Watch this table--
V.I.P. chef's table.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.250
Yes, Chef.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.085
Elise is ready to hand off

30:21.153 --> 30:22.854
her sea bass
to Chef Ramsay.

30:22.921 --> 30:24.355
Behind you. Hot.
Coming through, coming through.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.257
Sea bass.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.159
What's she done to that?
Elise.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.161
Yes, Chef.
<i>Come here.</i>

30:30.229 --> 30:31.996
Come here.
That's right, come here.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.599
I got one bass dry,
yeah,

30:34.666 --> 30:37.435
and one bass raw.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.870
<i>Raw!</i>

30:38.937 --> 30:40.505
Raw!

30:40.572 --> 30:43.641
Get the bass back in the pan.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.010
Elise had some problems
on the fish station.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.112
I mean, I thought chef was about
to kick her out of the kitchen.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.347
I was kind of hoping
for him to, but, you know...

30:49.415 --> 30:51.082
Elise.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

30:51.150 --> 30:53.151
<i>I don't know what kind of frame</i>
<i>of mind you're in,</i>

30:53.218 --> 30:54.152
but it's not on a
championship performance,

30:54.219 --> 30:55.753
<i>let me tell you.</i>

30:55.821 --> 30:57.722
Elise will never admit
that she's wrong,

30:57.790 --> 30:59.390
and she just stood there
with her eyebrows up

30:59.458 --> 31:00.958
and just looking.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.628
Who are you gonna blame now?
Nobody, Chef.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.363
It's about time you looked
at yourself in the mirror

31:05.431 --> 31:06.397
and took some responsibility.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.566
Yes, Chef.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.401
While Elise makes
another sea bass,

31:10.469 --> 31:11.903
over in the blue kitchen,

31:11.970 --> 31:13.571
Chino is ready
with his second attempt

31:13.639 --> 31:15.406
at entrees
for the Olympians.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.542
Look at that.
Chewed-up .

31:17.609 --> 31:19.076
And that.
That's raw.

31:19.144 --> 31:23.114
Yep, it's pink.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.850
Blue team...
Stop.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.052
Come here, you.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.321
Look at that.
That is raw.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.889
That is white fat.

31:31.957 --> 31:34.559
And what have you done
to this?

31:34.626 --> 31:35.893
<i>What is that?</i>

31:35.961 --> 31:37.361
So now you just ...
Yes, Chef.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.796
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

31:38.864 --> 31:40.565
I feel like a dumbass,
moron, idiot.

31:40.632 --> 31:41.966
'Cause I can cook
better than that.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.635
It just--it's embarrassing.
There you go.

31:44.703 --> 31:45.970
<i>All of you,</i>

31:46.038 --> 31:47.271
off out of here.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.474
Get upstairs.

31:49.541 --> 31:52.276
I'm so pissed,
it's not even funny.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.178
We sucked.
The way I look at it is,

31:54.246 --> 31:54.979
anytime you get a service
shut down, you suck.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.614
My apologies.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.716
On the last service, they were
good--that's what hurts.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.885
You got to fight for it.
<i>Exactly.</i>

32:00.953 --> 32:02.587
After shutting down
the blue kitchen...

32:02.654 --> 32:05.156
I want to serve the chef's
table--one lamb, one bass.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.859
Chef Ramsay looks to
the red team to deliver entrees

32:07.926 --> 32:09.627
to both chef's tables.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.329
How long?
You ready, Elise?

32:11.396 --> 32:13.931
Yep.
Slicing, guys. Slicing.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.433
Hurry up, Gina!

32:15.501 --> 32:17.969
Yes, Chef.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.504
Oh, come on.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.172
Stop.
All of you come here.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.307
What is that?

32:23.375 --> 32:24.442
It's raw, Chef.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.577
<i>I just sliced into it.</i>

32:26.645 --> 32:29.146
Oh, really?
I'd never have guessed.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.015
So, in front
of these ladies here,

32:31.083 --> 32:33.251
<i>this is how we want</i>
<i>to perform?</i>

32:33.318 --> 32:35.286
Raw bass,
overcooked bass.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.154
Raw lamb--
what an embarrassment.

32:39.024 --> 32:42.126
Sorry, Chef.
Why are you doing this to me?

32:42.194 --> 32:43.928
It's like being
in a volleyball match,

32:43.996 --> 32:46.130
and I'm the ball
getting pounded.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.566
I was just like, "Oh, my God."

32:48.634 --> 32:50.067
It was bad.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.269
Let me tell you something
really important.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.539
Shut it down.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.806
Get out!

32:59.141 --> 33:01.057
After shutting down
both kitchens...

33:01.058 --> 33:03.459
I'd rather send something.
Oui, <i>Chef.</i>

33:03.527 --> 33:05.561
Chef Ramsay has sous chefs Scott
and Andi make the entrees

33:05.629 --> 33:07.130
for the chef's tables.

33:09.233 --> 33:11.167
And after
a disastrous dinner service,

33:11.235 --> 33:13.836
Chef Ramsay sums up the evening
with one word...

33:13.904 --> 33:16.039
Pathetic.

33:16.106 --> 33:19.242
So, therefore,
the winning team tonight is...

33:20.444 --> 33:22.912
Nobody.

33:22.980 --> 33:26.749
<i>Both teams think</i>
<i>of two individuals</i>

33:26.817 --> 33:29.319
<i>that could really make</i>
<i>your team stronger</i>

33:29.386 --> 33:32.655
by exiting.

33:34.558 --> 33:36.225
Get out of here.

33:39.797 --> 33:41.898
Chino was struggling
in the kitchen.

33:41.966 --> 33:44.701
You don't come to Hell's Kitchen
to learn how to cook.

33:44.768 --> 33:46.336
You should already know.

33:46.403 --> 33:48.137
Is there any need

33:48.205 --> 33:49.906
to discuss
what's going on?

33:49.974 --> 33:51.574
I'm gonna be honest
with you guys.

33:51.642 --> 33:52.875
I know that I things up,
but, Natalie,

33:52.943 --> 33:54.177
don't make me look worse.

33:54.244 --> 33:55.812
I was trying to help you,

33:55.879 --> 33:57.246
and if it came off that way,
I'm sorry.

33:57.314 --> 33:59.115
It's like rubbing salt
on the wound.

33:59.183 --> 34:00.850
If you're not gonna help,
just don't help.

34:00.918 --> 34:03.252
It's like you were actually
on the red team at that point.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.254
She wasn't there
to really help.

34:05.322 --> 34:06.789
She was there to exasperate
how badly I was doing.

34:06.857 --> 34:08.757
Don't make yourself look good
to make me look bad.

34:08.826 --> 34:10.393
I think you did
what you had to do, girl.

34:10.460 --> 34:11.761
You know that.

34:11.829 --> 34:13.396
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

34:13.464 --> 34:15.264
Natalie, come on, girl.
What's wrong?

34:15.331 --> 34:16.866
Don't cry, girl.
Don't cry.

34:16.934 --> 34:18.501
She was very quiet,

34:18.569 --> 34:19.802
and then she started crying.

34:19.870 --> 34:21.237
She likes to put on a show,

34:21.304 --> 34:22.938
and it's a joke.

34:23.007 --> 34:24.841
<i>We're here as a team, girl.</i>
<i>You know that.</i>

34:24.908 --> 34:26.542
I have a teammate
that thinks I was trying

34:26.610 --> 34:27.744
to him
on purpose.

34:29.947 --> 34:32.014
<i>I wasn't lying.</i>

34:32.081 --> 34:33.683
You want to take
all that that I did for you

34:33.751 --> 34:35.251
and flip it around
on me--

34:35.319 --> 34:36.819
hell, no.
I don't deserve that.

34:36.887 --> 34:38.920
I care about everybody.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.357
<i>And I would never, ever, ever</i>

34:41.425 --> 34:43.426
<i>take this so much</i>
<i>as a competition</i>

34:43.494 --> 34:45.862
that I want to screw my own
team--I would never do that.

34:45.929 --> 34:47.463
<i>We know who's going up,</i>

34:47.531 --> 34:50.233
and that's all that needs
to be said.

34:52.369 --> 34:54.404
All right, I wrote
everybody's name down.

34:54.471 --> 34:55.905
<i>What we're gonna do</i>
<i>is just put a hash mark</i>

34:55.973 --> 34:57.340
<i>next to whoever had</i>
<i>a bad something,</i>

34:57.408 --> 34:58.508
day one, Krupa,
on the first challenge...

34:58.575 --> 35:00.543
Nobody else seemed
to take charge

35:00.611 --> 35:02.645
of how we were gonna deliberate
and how we're gonna decide,

35:02.713 --> 35:04.614
so I just came up with the idea
with the tally marks.

35:04.681 --> 35:06.983
What does anybody think?

35:07.051 --> 35:09.218
The first service, everybody
gets a point besides me.

35:09.286 --> 35:10.586
I don't think so.

35:10.654 --> 35:12.922
Let's be real
about this .

35:12.990 --> 35:15.191
Second service was perfect,
except we were waiting

35:15.259 --> 35:17.026
on Carrie's Caesar salad,

35:17.094 --> 35:18.227
and he was sending people
to help her toss salads.

35:18.295 --> 35:19.629
Elise.

35:19.696 --> 35:21.764
It's the truth.

35:21.832 --> 35:23.533
If I remember correctly,
he said

35:23.600 --> 35:24.434
that was one
of the best services of all

35:24.501 --> 35:26.702
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> history.

35:26.770 --> 35:29.205
Why would I get a point?
Somebody had to come help you.

35:29.273 --> 35:30.873
I think
this is .

35:30.941 --> 35:32.742
Elise, overall, collectively,
we'd be a lot better

35:32.810 --> 35:33.743
if you weren't running
your mouth all the time.

35:33.811 --> 35:34.644
Ha!
Whatever.

35:34.711 --> 35:35.945
Mouth.

35:36.013 --> 35:37.580
Ugh.

35:37.648 --> 35:39.348
I'm so tired
of the yip-yip dog.

35:39.416 --> 35:41.184
I would like to dropkick her
out of here.

35:41.251 --> 35:43.019
I am not gonna let you just walk
all over me anymore, Elise.

35:43.087 --> 35:45.088
Nobody's walking all over you.
We're doing the point system.

35:45.155 --> 35:46.956
No, I think
this point system blows.

35:47.024 --> 35:49.225
This is fair
all the way around the board.

35:49.293 --> 35:51.360
I think we should vote.
What? Why?

35:51.428 --> 35:53.563
<i>Because you know</i>
<i>you're gonna get another point?</i>

35:53.630 --> 35:56.699
It's who would make
the team stronger by leaving.

35:56.767 --> 35:58.835
Let's get these points done.

35:58.902 --> 36:00.870
I don't put up raw chicken.
What happened tonight?

36:00.938 --> 36:02.405
Hold up!
I'm talking.

36:02.473 --> 36:04.607
I don't put up raw fish.
Shut up. I'm talking.

36:04.675 --> 36:06.709
I'm talking.
I'm tired of hearing you talk.

36:06.777 --> 36:08.845
The second service,
you weren't in the kitchen,

36:08.912 --> 36:11.547
I ran the meat station,
and we went to victory,

36:11.615 --> 36:13.216
because I was
on the meat station,

36:13.283 --> 36:15.284
<i>and everybody</i>
<i>could concentrate.</i>

36:15.352 --> 36:16.786
Everybody knew their time.
Oh, yeah,
what happened tonight?

36:18.222 --> 36:19.689
So what?
I didn't give up.

36:19.756 --> 36:21.390
<i>So what?</i>
<i>I didn't give up.</i>

36:21.458 --> 36:23.192
<i>Shut up. I'm talking.</i>
Don't with me, Elise.

36:35.506 --> 36:37.340
Blue team,
have you come to a decision?

36:37.407 --> 36:38.307
Yes, Chef.

36:38.375 --> 36:39.909
Natalie, first nominee?

36:39.977 --> 36:42.311
Chino, Chef.

36:42.379 --> 36:43.312
<i>Chino.</i>

36:43.380 --> 36:45.248
<i>He was on the meat station.</i>

36:45.315 --> 36:47.817
And the meats weren't cooked
to the right temperature.

36:47.885 --> 36:50.453
Who is the blue team's
second nominee?

36:50.521 --> 36:53.422
Monterray, Chef.
Why?

36:53.490 --> 36:55.191
Based on tonight's
dinner service,

36:55.259 --> 36:57.994
not being able
to get out the fish.

36:58.061 --> 36:59.929
Red team, have you come
to a decision?

36:59.997 --> 37:01.364
Yes, Chef.

37:01.431 --> 37:03.466
Jennifer, first nominee
and why, please.

37:03.534 --> 37:05.735
Carrie, Chef.

37:05.802 --> 37:07.003
Carrie.
<i>Yes.</i>

37:07.070 --> 37:11.974
Carrie is our bottom player.

37:12.042 --> 37:13.309
Interesting.

37:13.377 --> 37:17.380
Who is the red team's
second nominee?

37:17.447 --> 37:19.916
<i>The second nominee is...</i>

37:30.336 --> 37:31.653
With no winning team,

37:31.654 --> 37:33.322
Chef Ramsay has asked

37:33.389 --> 37:35.491
both teams to nominate
two members for elimination.

37:35.558 --> 37:39.394
The blue team
chose Monterray and Chino.

37:39.462 --> 37:40.629
And the red team
has nominated...

37:40.697 --> 37:43.832
Carrie, Chef.

37:43.900 --> 37:48.003
Who is the red team's
second nominee?

37:48.071 --> 37:51.406
<i>The second nominee is...</i>

37:51.474 --> 37:54.076
Elise.

37:54.144 --> 37:55.277
Elise.
Why?

37:55.345 --> 37:57.679
The team feels
that the arguments

37:57.747 --> 37:59.181
<i>between Carrie and Elise</i>

37:59.249 --> 38:02.718
is definitely part
of our problem.

38:02.785 --> 38:05.721
<i>Elise, Carrie,</i>
<i>Chino, Monterray,</i>

38:05.788 --> 38:06.722
step forward, please.

38:14.197 --> 38:17.966
Monterray, why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:18.034 --> 38:20.502
I know I'm a strong cook.
I just had a bad night tonight.

38:20.570 --> 38:22.471
You looked so out of it.

38:22.539 --> 38:26.175
You weren't even responding to
the help that was being given.

38:26.242 --> 38:28.410
You just shut down.
<i>I don't believe I shut down.</i>

38:28.478 --> 38:30.179
I won't say
that I gave up,

38:30.246 --> 38:32.047
'cause that's
the last thing I do.

38:32.115 --> 38:33.715
You shut down.
<i>I didn't shut down, Chef.</i>

38:33.783 --> 38:35.284
<i>I don't care what you say,</i>

38:35.351 --> 38:37.085
he say, or anybody else
in back of me say.

38:37.153 --> 38:38.954
I don't take
from nobody.

38:39.022 --> 38:41.857
Chino...

38:41.925 --> 38:44.293
Why do you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:44.360 --> 38:45.694
It's been rough.

38:45.762 --> 38:47.696
It's been rough,
to say the least.

38:47.764 --> 38:49.298
<i>And I feel embarrassed.</i>

38:49.365 --> 38:51.166
<i>I wish I could show</i>
<i>the guys, man,</i>

38:51.234 --> 38:53.435
what I can do,
'cause...

38:53.503 --> 38:57.806
What is it
that I haven't seen

38:57.874 --> 39:00.609
that you've got left
in your tank?

39:00.677 --> 39:02.578
Redemption--
that's a big part of who I am,

39:02.645 --> 39:06.615
and I'm not gonna give up.
That I won't do.

39:06.683 --> 39:08.784
Carrie, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:08.851 --> 39:10.219
You know, Chef, I know
I've had a rough start.

39:10.286 --> 39:11.520
I'm not gonna deny that,

39:11.588 --> 39:12.988
and I know
I'm better than this.

39:13.056 --> 39:14.690
I am a fighter.
It's in my heart.

39:14.757 --> 39:16.825
It's in my soul.

39:16.893 --> 39:18.627
Right now
we have to think as a team.

39:18.695 --> 39:21.463
And Elise--
she is not a team player at all.

39:21.531 --> 39:24.366
I have stepped up my game
every service, every challenge.

39:24.434 --> 39:26.101
I've gotten better.

39:26.169 --> 39:27.502
<i>If you ask my team</i>
<i>who they'd rather see leave</i>

39:27.570 --> 39:29.037
<i>between me and Carrie,</i>

39:29.105 --> 39:30.205
I'm sure the answer
would be Carrie.

39:30.273 --> 39:31.640
Elizabeth,

39:31.708 --> 39:33.709
<i>if you had to drop</i>
<i>Elise or Carrie,</i>

39:33.776 --> 39:36.144
who would you drop?

39:36.212 --> 39:37.913
Carrie, Chef.

39:37.981 --> 39:39.448
<i>Jamie.</i>

39:39.515 --> 39:42.084
Elise, Chef.

39:42.151 --> 39:44.219
Krupa, who would you
have dropped?
Elise as well.

39:44.287 --> 39:45.787
<i>Jennifer, who would you drop?</i>

39:45.855 --> 39:47.656
Elise.
<i>Gina?</i>

39:47.724 --> 39:49.992
Elise, Chef.

39:50.059 --> 39:51.827
<i>Natalie, you were</i>
<i>in the red team?</i>

39:51.894 --> 39:53.895
Who would you send home--
Elise or Carrie?

39:53.963 --> 39:56.431
Elise, Chef.

39:56.499 --> 39:58.600
No hesitation there.

39:58.668 --> 40:01.069
Elise, I did what you asked.
I took a vote.

40:01.137 --> 40:03.238
<i>Here's the sad news</i>
<i>for you.</i>

40:03.306 --> 40:05.574
Your team want you
out of there so badly,

40:05.642 --> 40:07.809
you may be better off.

40:07.877 --> 40:09.344
I can guarantee one thing.

40:09.412 --> 40:11.246
I never make
the same mistake twice.

40:11.314 --> 40:13.148
This is my first time
on the carpet.

40:13.216 --> 40:14.416
This is her second,

40:14.484 --> 40:15.984
his second,
and his third.

40:16.052 --> 40:17.719
<i>It is not my time</i>
<i>to go yet, Chef.</i>

40:17.787 --> 40:19.688
I'm not here to throw anybody

40:19.756 --> 40:21.456
<i>under the bus.</i>
It's too late.

40:21.524 --> 40:23.458
I can work on my attitude.

40:23.526 --> 40:25.227
<i>But you can't give somebody</i>
<i>common sense and talent,</i>

40:25.295 --> 40:26.695
especially when you're 31.

40:26.763 --> 40:28.163
I'm 26.

40:28.231 --> 40:30.265
I have so much to learn
and so much more to give.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.767
Are you done?

40:31.834 --> 40:33.568
<i>Okay.</i>

40:35.471 --> 40:37.005
Time for a difficult decision.

40:38.975 --> 40:40.442
My decision is...

40:43.212 --> 40:46.481
Elise.

40:48.151 --> 40:51.687
Stop crying
and get back in line.

40:54.524 --> 40:57.492
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

40:57.560 --> 40:59.061
Chino.

40:59.128 --> 41:01.196
Three strikes,
you're out, buddy.

41:01.264 --> 41:03.465
Give me your jacket
and leave Hell's Kitchen.

41:03.533 --> 41:04.700
Thank you, Chef.

41:10.707 --> 41:12.240
I'm disappointed.

41:12.308 --> 41:13.875
My expectations
were a lot higher.

41:13.943 --> 41:15.644
I came here to cook,
you know,

41:15.712 --> 41:17.045
and it's a shame that
I didn't get a chance to cook

41:17.113 --> 41:18.313
a little bit more.

41:18.381 --> 41:20.082
But I will never sell out.

41:20.149 --> 41:22.651
I'll leave this place
with my dignity intact.

41:22.719 --> 41:23.719
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

41:23.786 --> 41:25.287
From tonight on,

41:25.355 --> 41:29.691
things are gonna get
a lot more difficult.

41:31.594 --> 41:34.062
Now off,
all of you.

41:34.130 --> 41:36.264
Elise thinks
that we all turned against her,

41:36.332 --> 41:37.599
that she thought
she had friends.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.301
There's gonna be hair-pulling.

41:39.369 --> 41:41.903
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

41:41.971 --> 41:44.606
I just hope I'm never on a team
with Elise again.

41:44.674 --> 41:46.875
She just does not get it.

41:46.943 --> 41:48.677
You're being voted off

41:48.745 --> 41:51.213
because you're the bitch.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.081
Everybody hates a winner.

41:53.149 --> 41:54.649
And I learned tonight
that I don't have any friends

41:54.717 --> 41:56.017
in the house.

41:56.085 --> 41:58.787
They don't know
who they with.

41:58.855 --> 42:01.223
Chino took his time in
Hell's Kitchen very seriously.

42:01.290 --> 42:03.925
The problem
is he seriously couldn't cook.

42:03.950 --> 42:07.950
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

42:08.257 --> 42:10.091
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:10.159 --> 42:11.759
I'm a winner.
Am I modest? No.

42:11.827 --> 42:13.427
I know where I came from.

42:13.495 --> 42:15.163
It's Elise versus everybody.

42:15.230 --> 42:16.097
I know you don't like me,
and you would love

42:16.165 --> 42:17.565
to see me go up.

42:17.633 --> 42:18.900
Will you quit taking it
personal?

42:18.967 --> 42:20.835
Get the over it.

42:20.903 --> 42:22.503
But what will happen
when the red team's nice girl...

42:22.571 --> 42:23.437
I was stewing
the Guinea hen.

42:23.505 --> 42:24.772
I grabbed that

42:24.840 --> 42:25.940
when there was still two
on there.

42:26.008 --> 42:27.575
Bitch, get off my Guinea hen.

42:27.643 --> 42:28.876
Flips her switch...

42:28.944 --> 42:30.578
Walking with my scallop.

42:30.646 --> 42:32.547
And dares to go toe-to-toe...

42:32.614 --> 42:33.247
<i>What? I don't have everything.</i>

42:33.315 --> 42:34.849
You bitch.

42:34.917 --> 42:36.250
With the queen of mean?

42:36.318 --> 42:37.451
Well, let the games begin.

42:37.519 --> 42:38.920
I did call it, Elise.

42:38.987 --> 42:40.721
Well, then make sure
I heard you.

42:40.789 --> 42:42.123
<i>It's like two cats fighting.</i>

42:42.191 --> 42:43.157
At dinner, you won't believe

42:43.225 --> 42:44.392
who Chef Ramsay throws out.

42:44.459 --> 42:45.993
Talk to each other!

42:46.061 --> 42:47.762
Get out!

42:47.830 --> 42:50.031
I can't bare
to look at you anymore.

42:50.098 --> 42:51.532
It's a <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>
Piss off!

42:51.600 --> 42:52.600
You'll have to see...

42:52.668 --> 42:53.467
He could send two people home.

42:53.535 --> 42:55.336
He could send four people home.

42:55.404 --> 42:58.105
To believe.
Bring it on.
