[Zoe] <i>So, today is a big day</i>
<i>for the stables.</i>

00:41.240 --> 00:42.600
[boy] It's pony camp!

00:43.720 --> 00:45.400
- [kids laugh]
- [Zoe] <i>Super exciting.</i>

00:47.280 --> 00:51.520
<i>But it's hard to think about the fun times
when a pony has been stolen.</i>

01:00.760 --> 01:05.040
<i>And you kind of got someone
wrongly arrested for being a horse thief.</i>

01:10.560 --> 01:14.600
<i>And if I could just go to the stables,
I could sort it out...</i>

01:15.720 --> 01:16.720
<i>but I'm banned.</i>

01:20.400 --> 01:21.400
[knock on door]

01:23.280 --> 01:24.720
- We're going.
- Okay.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.040
Wanna see Gramps
have his plaster taken off?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.040
You know, as fun as that sounds...

01:29.120 --> 01:30.280
[chuckles] Didn't think so.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.760
- We'll be back around 4:00.
- Okay.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.720
- Look after Rosie.
- [clicks tongue] Don't I always?

01:43.440 --> 01:45.560
What if she's not going to the hospital?

01:46.720 --> 01:49.480
- What if she went to meet with Mia's dad?
- With Gramps?

01:50.040 --> 01:53.240
- Rosie, you really need to let this go.
- But consider the evidence.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.480
In Mom's diary, it said she was in love
with somebody who was called "E."

01:57.560 --> 01:59.400
"Elliot" starts with E.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.160
That's your evidence, the alphabet?

02:02.480 --> 02:04.680
I'm still building my case,
thank you very much.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.400
- Why are you wearing stinky horse clothes?
- I wanted to go to pony camp,

02:09.480 --> 02:10.680
and I was wondering if...

02:10.760 --> 02:14.200
If you and I could go
and get squished by some crazy horses?

02:14.800 --> 02:16.080
Great sister skills.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.720
I just really need to talk to Pin, okay?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.880
I... I made a mistake.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.080
He was stealing and you caught him.
Where's the mistake exactly?

02:24.760 --> 02:25.760
You know what?

02:26.240 --> 02:27.800
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.320
[sighs]

02:31.880 --> 02:33.320
Raven told me I was wrong.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
Raven?

02:36.560 --> 02:37.720
As in, the horse?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.080
Now he's a talking horse? Are you serious?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.520
You know what? I need to go to camp.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.120
Why don't you come?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.920
[Rosie] Wait.
How are you gonna pay for it?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.520
- My savings.
- What if Mom finds out?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.880
- She's on the mainland.
- What if I catch horse measles?

02:50.960 --> 02:54.440
Well, then I'll take you straight
to the Center for Made-Up Diseases.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.560
- What if I break my leg?
- Ugh!

02:56.640 --> 02:57.640
It could happen.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.640
Have I done it right?

03:01.840 --> 03:02.880
Guys?

03:02.960 --> 03:07.880
Um, sorry, Ben, we were too busy assessing
the way Marcus' horse approaches the jump.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.600
[crowd clapping and cheering]

03:11.680 --> 03:13.120
He is so hot.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.840
Yes, Becky.
Marcus' horse is, uh, somewhat sweaty.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.680
[Becky] I'm not talking about the horse.
I'm talking about Marcus.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.760
- Girls are gross, right, Bob?
- [Bob grunts]

03:27.400 --> 03:28.720
He's amazing.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.360
[crowd clapping and cheering]

03:44.680 --> 03:48.800
Remember, it's all about confidence,
in yourself and in your horse.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.000
[crowd clapping and cheering]

03:51.080 --> 03:55.520
[sighs] <i>Marcus. The guy who thinks</i>
<i>everyone's in love with him.</i>

03:58.360 --> 03:59.600
[all cheering]

04:00.320 --> 04:02.440
<i>Maybe he has a point about that.</i>

04:03.880 --> 04:05.400
This place has so much poop,

04:05.480 --> 04:07.680
they might as well rename it
The Poop Palace.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.160
Give it a chance.
You might enjoy yourself.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.680
Welcome to the <i>neigh</i> borhood.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.840
Get it? "Neigh"?

04:20.080 --> 04:23.040
Think you're gonna be okay with these guys
for a few minutes?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.120
Sure.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.440
I'll just try to stand very still
and not touch anything.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.080
Or anyone.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.920
I'm glad you like puns. I've got loads.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.960
Get ready for the <i>mane </i>event,
where you'll see the <i>reini</i> ng champion.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.440
Uh, Zoe, I changed my mind!

04:39.520 --> 04:40.560
[drill whirs]

04:43.720 --> 04:44.560
Dad, don't.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.360
- I'm just gonna have a word.
- Leave her. It's over.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.840
Just stay away from that girl.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.640
Don't worry. I will.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.800
Hey.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.920
Firefly was an easy target.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.120
A beautiful horse in a broken stable.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.120
Are you okay?

05:15.360 --> 05:16.560
I'm never gonna see him again.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.040
- It's all your fault.
- What? No...

05:21.120 --> 05:23.120
If it wasn't for you,
Firefly would be here.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.880
- But I didn't...
- You said that Pin was the horse thief.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.800
Because of you,
no one was watching the stables.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.440
Firefly was alone, and they took him.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.120
Guys, can we keep a lid
on all the stolen horse talk?

05:35.760 --> 05:38.000
I need the kids to be leaving here
raving about us.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.600
- If they find out we lost a horse...
- It might ruin their day?

05:42.480 --> 05:43.480
Yeah, I get it.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.640
Oh. Why is Pin back?

05:49.200 --> 05:52.360
- He's working.
- [Mia] He's a thief. She's a liar.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.720
No wonder you're worried
about the reputation of your stables.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.400
This is all my fault.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.200
I shouldn't have called Pin a horse thief.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.160
- I didn't have all the facts.
- You just did what you thought was right.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.800
- Try telling that to Mia.
- I can handle Mia.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.640
Okay?

06:18.520 --> 06:20.720
Okay, guys, let's get this camp started.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.360
Everyone meet in the paddock.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.160
- I hope you're pleased with yourself.
- No, I'm not, at all.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.800
What... What is your problem with me?

06:32.120 --> 06:33.680
I know I hurt Pin, but...

06:34.680 --> 06:36.040
But it's more than that, isn't it?

06:44.920 --> 06:45.920
Hey.

06:47.040 --> 06:51.240
So, I've got a list of people
who hate me right now, and...

06:52.480 --> 06:54.600
I'm just making sure you're not on it.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
Hey.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.520
[Sam] Can everyone gather round, please?

07:08.320 --> 07:11.400
Uh, excuse me.
A little bit of personal space?

07:12.440 --> 07:16.960
Welcome to Bright Field Stables'
first ever pony camp.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.600
[crowd cheering]

07:18.680 --> 07:21.480
- [kids] Bright Fields forever!
- Go, Sam!

07:21.560 --> 07:23.680
Thank you, officer. [clears throat]

07:24.960 --> 07:27.000
- Okay...
- What did I tell you?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.440
Totally in love with her.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.760
She has no idea.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.080
And as riding is very hungry work,

07:32.160 --> 07:35.560
you'll be very pleased to hear
that our barbecue is up and running.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.280
[crowd] Ooh!

07:37.360 --> 07:40.560
- [Sam] We're also gonna work...
- Mia's over there. I'm gonna go say hi.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.200
Ah. You're not gonna annoy her
with questions about her dad, are you?

07:44.280 --> 07:45.280
No.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.520
[Sam] So, impress me.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.760
Okay, campers under 12,
come with me and grab a shovel,

07:51.840 --> 07:54.760
- because we have some mucking out to do.
- No way.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.880
Come on, or there won't be any poo left.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.960
I'm gonna stink until I'm 16.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.840
- Try to have fun.
- Zoe!

08:05.440 --> 08:06.480
[Becky mumbles]

08:07.760 --> 08:09.760
- [Marcus] Hey. You made it.
- Hey. Yeah.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.360
Here I am. [chuckles]

08:11.440 --> 08:13.440
You gonna start secretly filming me again?

08:13.520 --> 08:16.000
[scoffs] Okay, Marcus,
I wasn't filming you. It was...

08:16.080 --> 08:17.920
It's all right. Becky and Jade told me.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.600
[chuckles softly]

08:23.080 --> 08:26.840
We... We thought that you weren't coming.
Becky and Jade said...

08:26.920 --> 08:29.240
My mom ended up signing
the permission slip anyway.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.480
She used pink pen,
and her handwriting was shaky,

08:31.560 --> 08:34.296
- 'cause she just finished her coffee.
- [Zoe] <i>Why are you still talking?</i>

08:34.320 --> 08:36.856
- [Marcus] We're glad you're here.
- Right. Have fun on the hack.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.520
- See you later.
- Wait. You're not going?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.640
It wouldn't be right. Not without Firefly.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.560
[Marcus] You still have Fletcher,
haven't you?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.880
- I'll help you tack him up.
- [Mia] That's so kind. Thank you.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.880
- [Becky] You'll ride him one day.
- Hmm?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.560
Raven. I know you will.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.960
I'm just afraid
Mia's gonna get rid of him.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.920
Come on, Becky, tell her your theory.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.520
If you impress Sam again today,
she might let you ride Raven.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.280
Then you can work out
his interpersonal problems,

09:18.360 --> 09:22.080
- and we can all live happily ever after.
- Got it all figured out, haven't you?

09:22.160 --> 09:25.360
Well, believe it or not,
she's actually the brains in this outfit.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.760
Hey, Pin!

09:34.280 --> 09:35.280
Hey...

09:35.840 --> 09:38.680
If you would just talk to me
for one second.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.320
[stammers] I just...

09:40.920 --> 09:41.920
[sighs]

09:42.880 --> 09:45.960
[Sam] Look, don't get me wrong,
I feel terrible about Firefly.

09:46.240 --> 09:50.600
Then get CCTV, security fences,
a gate that actually locks.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.800
- I just don't have the money.
- Find it.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.200
- [Sam] Where?
- [Jade] Zoe.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.920
Saddle up.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.120
- We're off, okay?
- Okay, I'll be there.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.920
[Sam] Please, Elliot.
You know that we're struggling.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.840
You don't seem to realize,
that horse cost me a lot of money.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.360
What if I took my cash out?
How long do you think you'd stay open?

10:09.920 --> 10:13.160
- Well, I'll do everything I can.
- Yes, you will.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.080
[Zoe] <i>Hmm. Guess I'm not the only one</i>
<i>having a rough day.</i>

10:29.280 --> 10:31.000
- I'm watching you, E.
- [door closes]

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
[engine starts]

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
Ew.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.440
Ah, the muck heap. Beautiful, isn't it?

10:39.520 --> 10:42.480
I've never seen so much poop
in my entire life.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.280
It's not even that big at the moment.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.080
After pony camp,
it's gonna be twice the size it is now.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.720
Wow, I can't wait to see that.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.520
Ah, me, neither.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.120
I don't get why people like
these horrible hairy poo bags so much.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.080
Well, they're powerful, beautiful,

10:58.160 --> 11:00.680
and the way they move,
there's this kind of freedom...

11:00.760 --> 11:03.400
They may be powerful and beautiful,
but they still stink.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.600
[chuckles]

11:07.680 --> 11:09.000
[whinnying]

11:09.560 --> 11:11.880
<i>Hmm. Jealous, much?</i>

11:11.960 --> 11:14.560
Raven, if I could take you out, I would.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.240
- Uh, where are you going?
- [Zoe] On my first hack.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.680
Won't be gone long.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.560
Are you sure you'll be all right
on your own, Rosie?

11:22.720 --> 11:23.720
I'll survive.

11:25.080 --> 11:25.920
Probably.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.640
I know you're not used to horses.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.040
You will be super careful, won't you?

11:30.760 --> 11:34.440
- Do you want me to stay with you?
- Oh, good idea, Zoe.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.000
You stay here and join the little ones
in the paddock.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.760
Probably more your level anyway.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.920
Or you could come with us.
I'm sure Marcus could find you a helmet.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.880
As if. Think of the hat hair.

11:44.720 --> 11:45.920
[Pin] Everyone ready?

11:47.080 --> 11:49.040
- We're waiting for you.
- Where's Marcus?

11:49.120 --> 11:52.520
He's with the little kids.
Sam's asked me to take the hack. Come on.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.800
And here I was thinking that stealing

11:54.880 --> 11:56.720
and getting arrested
were his only talents.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.400
Go.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.320
Make up with, uh,
Mr. Cheekbones over there.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.600
- Are you sure?
- I'll be fine.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
Thank you.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.640
Uh, don't forget to tell him
about your ability to talk to horses.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.280
Hey. I just wanted to say sorry
about the whole, you know,

12:26.360 --> 12:27.920
getting you arrested thing.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.200
Look, I really am sorry.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.880
It was an idiot move.
I should have known better.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.280
And, also, I guess I just think...

12:39.360 --> 12:42.360
I... I saw you take something
from that cabinet, and...

12:43.720 --> 12:44.880
Is everything okay?

12:47.640 --> 12:48.800
Are you in trouble?

12:50.600 --> 12:53.360
Pin, whatever it is, let me help you.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.920
What am I supposed to think
if you won't talk to me?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.720
- Becky, you're in charge.
- What?

13:04.800 --> 13:06.280
- What?
- What?

13:06.360 --> 13:07.240
Woo-hoo!

13:07.320 --> 13:08.320
Wait, what?

13:08.960 --> 13:10.360
[Zoe] Wait.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.520
Major, honey,
I know we have never cantered before,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.400
but now might be a good time to try it.
Let's go.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.200
Pin, get back here!

13:34.880 --> 13:37.440
[Zoe] <i>Wow, this is amazing.</i>

13:52.200 --> 13:54.000
<i>Pin, where did you go?</i>

14:32.160 --> 14:33.760
Can't take a hint, can you?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.000
- What's in there?
- Take a look.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.480
Look, I'm not gonna play this game
with you again, okay? So, just tell me.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.560
What were the sedatives for?

14:46.640 --> 14:48.640
To keep Firefly quiet
so I could steal him.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.920
- It's what you think, isn't it?
- What am I supposed to think

14:52.000 --> 14:54.840
when you're all mysterious
and you don't tell me anything?

14:54.920 --> 14:56.880
[horse whinnies]

14:58.200 --> 14:59.240
Tell me you didn't.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
Firefly?

15:10.520 --> 15:11.520
He's a moor pony.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.240
- He's lame.
- Why not take him to the vet?

15:15.320 --> 15:16.920
[Pin] He's the council's responsibility.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.080
But they've no money
to treat the wild horses, so...

15:21.440 --> 15:22.480
they'd put him down.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.920
You were taking the medicine for him.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.600
Pin, I am so sorry...

15:28.680 --> 15:30.480
Do you know what thieves do to horses?

15:31.040 --> 15:34.440
They drug them. Cart them
around the country in the back of vans.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.720
Sell them to people
that don't even like horses,

15:36.800 --> 15:40.360
that just wanna own something shiny
and expensive and wild.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.680
You thought I could be a part
of something like that?

15:47.760 --> 15:50.840
- I'm sorry, I got it wrong. I...
- Yeah, you did.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.240
Until you look beyond
what's in front of you,

15:54.320 --> 15:56.240
- you'll keep getting it wrong.
- I'm sorry.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.320
You should go now.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.720
Dad doesn't want me talking to you,
and now I know why.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.920
Just go.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
You all right?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.920
She won't be bothering us again.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.560
[Becky] Beyond those hills
is the old barn.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.616
Which, by the way, is totally haunted.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.960
That barn is about as haunted
as my saddle pad.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.760
Hundreds of years ago,

16:50.840 --> 16:54.000
a greedy lord heard
of the great treasure hidden in the hills.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.520
And which lord?
And how many hundreds of years ago?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.240
I mean, this story needs facts.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.280
[Becky] Jade,
you're interrupting my story.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.800
He rode out in search of the treasure,

17:04.520 --> 17:06.720
and then a huge storm came in.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.640
But the lord pushed on,
desperate to find the loot.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.720
And then he froze to death.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.120
Now the ghost pony wanders the moors.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.920
And until she's reunited with her master,

17:20.200 --> 17:24.240
she'll claim our souls, one by one.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.440
- [horse whinnies]
- [Susie gasps]

17:27.560 --> 17:28.640
Grow up, Becky.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.240
So... come on.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.280
Why is Zoe chasing Pin?

17:34.360 --> 17:36.680
Something else she wants
to wrongly accuse him of?

17:36.760 --> 17:38.160
I'll let you in on a secret.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.240
Please do.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.680
Zoe is absolutely petrified
of the Ghost Pony.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.200
She got spooked. Had to take a moment.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.480
Fine, don't tell me.
I'll find out by myself, don't you worry.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.360
Come on, Susie, this is boring.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
Susie?

17:56.360 --> 17:58.480
Sorry. I didn't catch that.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.400
[scoffs] It's such a beautiful day,

18:01.480 --> 18:04.000
and you've hardly taken your eyes
off your phone.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.480
Come on, give it over.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.680
I'm not giving you my phone.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.080
Susie, remember our no boys pact?

18:11.880 --> 18:13.440
If one of us is single, then...

18:14.000 --> 18:15.360
Then we both are.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.400
It's not like anyone texts you anyway.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.160
I'm kidding. [chuckles]

18:22.240 --> 18:23.640
Come on, everyone. Let's bail.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.360
[laughs] "Bail." Like "hay bale."

18:27.200 --> 18:29.680
Wait! The hack. It's not over yet.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.240
- [Jade] I guess we should head back, too.
- [Becky] No, Jade.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.520
I was given a job,
and I'm going to get that job done.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.520
Come on, Bob. Let's show the world
what a natural navigator you are.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.240
[Jade] Becky, it's this way.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
I knew that.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.840
See, it's all about concealing the flaws.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.040
With a sparkly scrunchy,

18:48.120 --> 18:50.400
we're taking attention away
from his snaggletooth.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.680
- Wow.
- Have you thought about using conditioner?

18:53.840 --> 18:57.080
- And not just for the horse.
- Thanks.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.680
No problem. Can you brush his tail?

19:01.560 --> 19:03.760
Ah. Fine work, indeed.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.200
I know, right?

19:05.280 --> 19:09.200
It's amazing what a little LA style can do
to a matted, neglected mane.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.600
You know, I really thought
you'd be long gone by now.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.840
Well, someone told me
that horses are beautiful,

19:15.920 --> 19:17.800
and maybe they were right.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.640
Okay, you need to comb the tail,
not tickle it.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.360
Here.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.280
Pony makeovers. Nice work.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.800
- Thanks.
- Think you can do something with Fletcher?

19:33.880 --> 19:36.200
This old thing needs
all the help he can get.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.200
No offense.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.000
Sure. We have a waiting list,

19:40.080 --> 19:43.200
but we also have a priority booking system
for our VIPs.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.600
[chuckles]

19:45.040 --> 19:49.000
So, your dad... E.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.840
I mean Elliot.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.120
- Does he know my mom at all?
- [Mia] I don't think so, but...

19:54.960 --> 19:56.640
Look, let's talk Zoe.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.800
Everyone says she's this amazing rider.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.200
I know. It's so annoying.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.760
Anyway, your dad...

20:04.600 --> 20:06.880
is he, you know, seeing anyone?

20:06.960 --> 20:08.800
Seeing anyone? Of course not.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.640
But, um, Zoe, she's had lots
of riding lessons back home, right?

20:12.720 --> 20:14.880
No, not one. So, your dad,

20:15.400 --> 20:18.720
does he ever go out at odd times
of the night, or day, wearing cologne?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.400
She really is a natural rider.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.480
Good for her.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.880
Yeah. She found something
she's really good at

20:25.960 --> 20:28.360
and she really loves,
and she's not even allowed to...

20:32.360 --> 20:34.600
- Not even allowed to what?
- Nothing.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.920
Rosie... I thought we had a special bond.

20:39.480 --> 20:43.120
I thought we were close, like sisters.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.280
Okay, fine.
Zoe's not allowed to be riding.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.640
Like, at all. If my mom knew we were here,
she would totally flip.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.240
Zoe's not allowed to ride?

20:55.800 --> 20:57.240
That's so sad.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.560
[Jade] Hey, Zoe! Wait up!

21:22.720 --> 21:23.720
Where have you been?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.680
- Becky got us lost.
- I did<i> not </i>get us lost.

21:27.120 --> 21:31.920
I just decided, in my role as hack leader,
to take a little detour, that's all.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.680
- [Jade] How did it go with Pin?
- What'd you find out?

21:35.320 --> 21:36.720
That I'm an idiot.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.680
He's been taking the sedatives
to treat an injured moor pony.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.040
He was still stealing.
You were right about that.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.400
Yeah, but instead of watching him,

21:44.480 --> 21:46.520
I should've been watching
the real thieves.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.640
[Jade] You thought you were doing
the right thing.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.200
Tell that to Firefly.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.560
Don't let this ruin your day.

21:52.640 --> 21:56.040
Let's head back to pony camp.
We'll be just in time for the barbecue.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.880
You're right, you're right.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.000
- I am so hungry that I could eat a horse.
- Zoe!

22:00.080 --> 22:03.440
Oh. Sorry. I didn't think, Major.
I'm sorry. [laughs]

22:03.520 --> 22:04.920
[Jade clicking tongue]

22:07.160 --> 22:08.320
Hey, wait for us.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.840
Whee!

22:17.160 --> 22:18.200
They're back.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.320
Is that Zoe?

22:31.880 --> 22:34.800
- This doesn't look good.
- Get off that horse right now!

22:34.880 --> 22:35.960
Mom.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.760
- Mrs. Phillips, is there a problem?
- [Frank] Maggie.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.240
- Yes, there is. And Zoe knows what it is.
- You don't have to be scared.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.080
I'm good. I've been having lessons.
I galloped.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.720
I asked you not to come here.
I explained, I...

22:48.240 --> 22:49.240
You promised.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.160
I said...
Well, I implied that it was all right.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.040
[Maggie] I'm her mother.
I decide what's best.

22:54.120 --> 22:58.200
- Rosie's clearly been so frightened...
- Rosie's doing really well.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.200
[Zoe] She's right, Mom.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.240
Rosie's been doing great.
She's actually enjoying herself.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.160
- Why did someone call me to come get her?
- What?

23:08.160 --> 23:11.040
I rang her before you told me, I swear.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.840
I would never drop Zoe in it.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.160
It's just... Well, you looked so upset.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.520
It's okay. You didn't know.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.400
- You're never coming back here.
- No.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.000
- [Frank] I think you're overreacting.
- He's right.

23:23.080 --> 23:27.200
One foot in this place, I'm shipping you
back to the States. You understand? Zoe?

23:27.520 --> 23:30.320
[sighs] Yes, I understand.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.840
[Maggie] Rosie, get over here.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.920
We're leaving.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.560
- You sure you're all right?
- [Rosie] I'm fine.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.840
[Jade over phone] <i>So, when you got home,</i>
<i>on a scale of one to hangry T. rex,</i>

23:52.920 --> 23:54.280
<i>how mad did your Mom get?</i>

23:55.240 --> 23:58.240
I think she might talk to me again
when I'm 18.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.480
- I can't believe Mia called her.
- [Zoe] <i>It was a revenge call.</i>

24:02.040 --> 24:03.280
She blames me for Firefly.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.240
[Jade] <i>She's the one that put Firefly</i>
<i>in a stable with a broken door.</i>

24:06.320 --> 24:07.960
Yeah. Raven totally kicked the door off.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.880
I mean, Firefly was right there
in a broken stable.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.920
The thieves didn't really need to try.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.600
What if they didn't take Firefly
because the door was broken?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
What if they took him

24:21.200 --> 24:23.560
- because they thought he was Raven?
- What?

24:24.400 --> 24:27.880
Sometimes you need to look
beyond what's in front of you.

24:28.640 --> 24:32.440
Firefly wasn't just in a broken stable.
He was in <i>Raven's</i> stable.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.480
The thieves took the wrong horse.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.720
And when they realize their mistake...

24:39.760 --> 24:41.120
they'll come back for him.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.280
[door clatters]

24:44.360 --> 24:45.560
[snorts]
