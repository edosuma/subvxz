00:13.547 --> 00:16.648
   A rumor is a forest fire

00:16.650 --> 00:18.050
        So kill it dead

00:18.052 --> 00:19.585
        Or run it wild

00:19.587 --> 00:21.320
    We could blow this out

00:21.322 --> 00:24.490
  Or let it burn us up alive

00:24.492 --> 00:27.059
        Cannot stop
       what's in my mind

00:27.061 --> 00:29.695
        'Cause now I want
       your body on mine

00:29.697 --> 00:31.497
         'Cause when the
        world's so cold

00:31.499 --> 00:34.400
         Somebody gotta
        hold you tight

00:34.402 --> 00:36.668
              Ohh

00:36.670 --> 00:40.272
       Come run inside,
      run inside my love

00:40.274 --> 00:42.174
              Ohh

00:42.176 --> 00:44.276
    Come run inside my love

00:44.278 --> 00:46.578
     Everyone needs
    a little place to hide

00:46.580 --> 00:50.115
      When you're about
     to blow it open wide

00:50.117 --> 00:52.351
              Ohh

00:52.353 --> 00:55.687
       Come run inside,
      run inside my love

00:55.689 --> 00:58.090
      Run inside my love

00:58.092 --> 00:59.792
       Run inside my love

00:59.794 --> 01:02.661
              Ohh

01:02.663 --> 01:06.331
       Come run inside,
      run inside my love

01:06.333 --> 01:08.233
      Run inside my love

01:08.235 --> 01:11.170
      Run inside my love

01:13.441 --> 01:17.209
       Come run inside,
      run inside my love

01:17.211 --> 01:20.279
Mom, I want to talk
 to you about something.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.513
              Mom.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.082
        Yeah, yeah, yeah,
        me, too, honey.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.349
        I don't want to
        make you nervous,

01:24.351 --> 01:26.618
  but Morgana Ferzari is here.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.620
      She wants to see how
      you do in the shoot.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.590
   Now, don't worry.
   Just be professional, okay?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.826
  I was talking about college.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.694
-Honey, we've been through this.
-Sofia.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.497
 Yeah, Madeline, wait over there
 until Farriet is ready.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.100
   Right now we have exciting
   things on the table --

01:41.102 --> 01:44.269
    a modeling contract most
    girls can only dream of.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.305
        All our hard work
        is gonna pay off.

01:46.307 --> 01:50.275
 Yeah, but I would still love to
 apply, you know, have options.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.811
Uh, lift it up.
 Okay, turn to your right.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.713
           Stop. Okay.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.850
  This...will give you options.

01:57.852 --> 02:01.753
       -The latest proofs.
       -Oh, excuse me.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.756
     Um, hey, you are
     coming tomorrow, right?

02:04.758 --> 02:08.393
Darling, we can't do everything.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.329
     Graduation's important.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.731
   I know, and so is a meeting
   about your contract.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.299
       Yeah, she's ready.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.734
I'm ready.
  Let's go. I'm waiting.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.607
       Oh, this is futile!

02:21.609 --> 02:22.808
   None of this is gonna work.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.176
 Fashion Week is two weeks away.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.878
 Where are my others assistants?

02:29.183 --> 02:31.250
              Huh.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.553
    If you remove the wings,

02:34.555 --> 02:37.789
  you can let the simplicity of
  the dress speak for itself.

02:37.791 --> 02:41.426
  And with this burnt rouge...

02:41.428 --> 02:44.496
 bring the eye from the hemline

02:44.498 --> 02:47.332
   through the bodice,
   highlighting the neckline.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.903
     What a remarkable idea.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.471
       -No, I just --
       -?? No, no, no, no.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.939
     Why stop at one outfit?

02:53.941 --> 02:56.408
     If I knew we had
     an expert in our midst,

02:56.410 --> 02:58.310
       I would have relied
       on you earlier.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.412
            Morgana?

03:00.414 --> 03:02.581
       Cora Hamilton,
       perhaps you should

03:02.583 --> 03:06.185
        just, uh, curate
        the entire shoot.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.320
    Now, while I don't mind
    letting Sofia's daughter

03:08.322 --> 03:09.855
         play dress-up,

03:09.857 --> 03:11.456
     it might be stretching
     the friendship

03:11.458 --> 03:15.194
 just a tad to give her my job.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.462
        Don't you think?

03:17.464 --> 03:20.632
      Cora?
      Where are you going?

03:20.634 --> 03:22.668
           The dress.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.237
              Ohh

03:25.239 --> 03:28.507
       Come run inside,
      run inside my love

03:28.509 --> 03:30.342
              Ohh

03:30.344 --> 03:33.512
    Come run inside my love

03:36.917 --> 03:38.417
              Stop!

03:38.419 --> 03:40.619
        Get away from me!
        Stop!

03:40.621 --> 03:44.923
       Come run inside,
      run inside my love

03:54.835 --> 03:56.435
              Mom?

03:56.437 --> 03:59.638
     Um, Sofia wants to know
     if you're all right.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.273
  Why can't she ask me herself?

04:01.275 --> 04:02.774
 She's on a call at the moment.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.743
   She's doing damage control.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.411
              Okay.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.962
Happy 18th, Cora!

04:23.964 --> 04:27.532
     Sending you good vibes
     from sunny Tea Tree.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.401
      Hope to see you soon.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.270
    All my love, Aunt Margot.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.032
     Did you see his shoes?

05:44.078 --> 05:45.811
This is a general announcement.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.714
     Flight 1138 bound
     for Sydney, Australia,

05:48.716 --> 05:51.550
   your departure gate
   is now changed to gate 26.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.760
      What on Earth do you
      think you're doing?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.663
     Do you think I wouldn't
     notice a $7,000 charge

06:04.665 --> 06:07.632
        for plane tickets
        to Australia?

06:07.634 --> 06:09.468
    I have got a catastrophe
    on my hands

06:09.470 --> 06:11.069
       that affects both
       of our reputations,

06:11.071 --> 06:13.538
    and you're running away.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.774
       Was this her idea?
       -Aunt Margot's?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.008
        Yeah, of course.
        I'm horrible.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.077
   She's the fun surfer aunt.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.613
   You know, I've barely heard
   from her since Caleb died.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.415
     No, it wasn't her idea.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.649
          It was mine.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.051
      She's always written
      and said

06:26.053 --> 06:27.853
     that I'm welcome
     to come stay whenever,

06:27.855 --> 06:30.922
        so I took her up
        on the offer.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.925
         She said she'd
         love to see me.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.627
        What? Is that
        so surprising --

06:35.629 --> 06:37.429
       someone actually
       wanting to see me?

06:37.431 --> 06:41.533
  You know, taking a genuine
  interest, asking them things,

06:41.535 --> 06:43.535
   wondering what they think,
   maybe listening to them?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.871
     I'm running New York's
     top model agency,

06:45.873 --> 06:47.906
      one that will launch
      you into a career

06:47.908 --> 06:51.543
    that will take care
    of you your entire life.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.513
   Darling, I cannot give you
   my attention all the time.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.582
   I don't want your attention
   all of the time.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.152
    But maybe once, you could
    have made an exception,

07:00.154 --> 07:04.723
  done something I wanted to do
  that was important to me.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.691
 I missed most of my childhood,

07:06.693 --> 07:08.493
      missed my graduation

07:08.495 --> 07:10.762
      so I could be
      where you wanted me,

07:10.764 --> 07:13.064
    when you wanted me there.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.833
    I've fit into your life,

07:14.835 --> 07:18.136
   and now I'm doing something
   on my own terms.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.672
       Sweetie, I know
       that you're upset,

07:20.674 --> 07:23.875
     but people like us
     can't afford accidents.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.710
      This was your chance
      to show Morgana

07:25.712 --> 07:27.479
    and the industry
    the polished young woman

07:27.481 --> 07:28.780
         you've become,

07:28.782 --> 07:31.082
   not some melodramatic teen.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.085
   Why won't you listen to me?

07:34.087 --> 07:35.654
     Even when your daughter
     is plastered on

07:35.656 --> 07:36.888
   every magazine in New York,

07:36.890 --> 07:40.225
       it's like you
       still can't see me.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.027
      Cora, you can't just
      always run away.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.830
     I am not running away.

07:44.832 --> 07:48.767
    I am running towards
    something else, anything,

07:48.769 --> 07:50.168
 as long as it's not your idea.

07:50.170 --> 07:55.674
 Now, why don't you just go back
 and do what you usually do --

07:55.676 --> 07:58.743
   get on with your busy life
   and forget about me?

08:08.989 --> 08:13.492
       I got a little
      secret in my heart

08:13.494 --> 08:15.660
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:15.662 --> 08:18.964
     this is your
     first officer speaking.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.832
      In a few minutes,
      we will be commencing

08:20.834 --> 08:23.235
    our descent into Sydney.

08:23.237 --> 08:26.238
     Cabin crew, prepare
     the cabin for landing.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.676
  Outside is black and white

08:31.678 --> 08:33.078
 We laying color on the floor

08:33.080 --> 08:35.179
- That's her.
-   -No way.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.918
     Good morning, miss.
     We'll be landing soon,

08:39.919 --> 08:41.285
       so here's your next
       boarding pass.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.121
          It's gate 4.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.791
    Uh, I booked first class.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.894
     There's no first class
     on a prop plane,

08:48.896 --> 08:50.161
  but I'm sure you'll have fun.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.226
   We'd better get out there.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.895
    It'll be smooth as glass.

09:57.998 --> 10:01.600
You know, tai chi
 is only beneficial

10:01.602 --> 10:05.337
     when you don't actively
     work against it.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.840
   I'm not working against it.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.676
    It's working against me.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.945
- It calms the mind.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.115
Imagine how much calmer you'd be
if you did it really quickly,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.751
       finished, and could
       do something else.

10:19.753 --> 10:23.021
       You seem to be
       missing the point.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.890
        You used to hate
        all this stuff.

10:25.892 --> 10:29.194
     The need for stillness
     outweighed my ego.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.198
      Luckily, I don't have
      that problem.

10:33.200 --> 10:38.103
My life is a well-oiled machine.

10:38.105 --> 10:41.139
     All set to pick your
     niece up this morning?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.241
       She doesn't get
       in until tomorrow.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.276
    You said that yesterday,

10:45.278 --> 10:47.245
        and as its habit,

10:47.247 --> 10:51.783
     tomorrow is now today.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.856
   You've waited for 10 years
   for her to come back,

10:57.858 --> 10:59.791
  and now you're gonna be late.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.826
            Breathe.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.289
              Cora?

11:31.291 --> 11:34.092
    Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

11:34.094 --> 11:35.427
      You're all grown up!

11:35.429 --> 11:37.295
         Sorry I'm late.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.830
           It's okay.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.433
   Oh, you're moving in, huh?

11:41.435 --> 11:43.435
     Uh, got to be prepared
     for anything.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.270
       All you'll need is
       your bathing suit.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.772
            Jump in.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.408
       You want to drive?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.976
               Oh.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.448
- Thanks for having me.
-  -Of course.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.883
  It was a wonderful surprise.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.819
     Last-minute trip, huh?

12:00.821 --> 12:03.054
     Yeah. You know, things
     are so busy right now.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.123
  If you get a chance for a
  holiday, you got to take it.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.425
     Well, I'm glad you did.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.095
      So, what's the plan?

12:10.097 --> 12:13.298
    Oh, uh, no plan, really.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.367
       Just kind of gonna
       see what happens.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.170
    What does your mom think
    about you coming to stay?

12:19.172 --> 12:21.973
    Hey, you know, she thinks
    it's a great idea.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.143
Okay. Good.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.479
        How is your mom?

12:27.481 --> 12:29.380
           She's good.
           She's fine.

12:29.382 --> 12:33.051
      Just always working.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.353
    It's a shame she couldn't
    come out last year.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.493
    I'm so sorry about Caleb.

12:41.495 --> 12:45.263
       Well, that's life.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.832
    I should call Sof anyway.
    It's been too long.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.534
              Sof.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.236
  That's really nice, actually.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.505
        Nobody back home
        calls her that.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.840
      Old habits die hard.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.179
   You remember when you were
   here last with your mom?

13:01.181 --> 13:03.114
Yeah.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.049
      Mom and I made a pact
      we'd come and visit

13:05.051 --> 13:07.218
   every year after that trip,

13:07.220 --> 13:11.289
   but I guess life happened.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.025
     Well, you're here now.

13:14.027 --> 13:18.963
     I had my cake
    and you had your doubt

13:18.965 --> 13:21.299
           Long gone

13:21.301 --> 13:26.471
   My baby's gonna carry on

13:26.473 --> 13:29.040
           Long gone

13:29.042 --> 13:33.478
   My baby's gonna carry on

13:36.583 --> 13:38.883
Ohh.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.485
  Oh, you got to be kidding me.

13:45.559 --> 13:47.392
    You better be
    the new paper boy, Owen.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.829
Margs, I just need
 you to hear me out, okay?

13:50.831 --> 13:52.964
   I want to help you.
   -Oh, do you hear that, Bee?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.899
  Owen wants to help out.
  You can start with the bags,

13:54.901 --> 13:56.467
      and then, you know,
      the lawn needs a mow.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.570
  Sell me the surf school,
  and I'll do you a good deal.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.271
      You've only got
      one instructor left.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.372
        The thing is just
        sitting there.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.574
  We had plenty of instructors

14:02.576 --> 14:04.292
       before you started
       stealing them.

14:04.293 --> 14:06.009
  And don't call me Margs.
  You know how much I hate it.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.378
       Hello, little fish.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.281
     Cora, you remember
     my mother-in-law, Bee?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.583
         Yes, of course.

14:11.585 --> 14:12.884
   It's very nice to see you.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.252
      You're all grown up.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.987
Listen, they
  needed the work, okay?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.522
   Things have been
   drying up here for months,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.490
  and Tom's a good kid,
  but you're wasting his talent

14:19.492 --> 14:21.192
    on a handful of tourists.
    -How many times

14:21.194 --> 14:22.360
       do we have to have
       this conversation?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.928
- Let's get your luggage.
-  -Margs.

14:23.930 --> 14:27.999
             Margot.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.901
         I'm just trying
         to help you.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.069
             Really?

14:31.071 --> 14:34.072
          Yeah. Really.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.075
     Because I do need help.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.409
        I'm overwhelmed.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.644
   I got all these surfboards,

14:39.646 --> 14:41.913
        and some of them
        have a leg rope.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.081
     And I know it's called
     a leg rope,

14:43.083 --> 14:45.183
    but do I put it on my leg
    or my ankle?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.551
      And wet suits --
      I know they get wet,

14:46.553 --> 14:47.652
   but sometimes they're dry.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.588
  What does it all mean, Owen?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.257
             Right.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.392
         Okay. I'm done.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.295
       Everyone, I tried.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.964
            I'm done.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.599
  You have a nice visit, Cora.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.167
         -Hi.
         -You're taller.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.670
       See you later, Bee.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.473
        I'm sorry, hon.
        Just ignore him.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.074
        Ignore them both.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.676
A heads up would have been nice.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.112
 You don't have a mobile phone.
 What was I supposed to do?

15:14.114 --> 15:16.414
         Send a pigeon?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.191
I was gonna clean up today.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.626
               Oh.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.529
  Your place is very Boho-Chic.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.966
It's not bad for
 a couple of surfers, I guess.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.201
     Your aunt took out
     the world championship

15:37.203 --> 15:38.670
     the year you were born.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.238
            -Really?
            -Yeah.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.040
      And twice after that.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.675
Margot is a world record holder.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.377
I'm sure her mom has
 bored her with that already.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.679
        Um, no, actually.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.714
          She has not.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.950
       I better get going.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.519
       This surf festival
       is doing my nut.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.955
      All those geriatrics
      organizing events.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.456
        Someone is gonna
        pop their clogs.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.691
      I'll leave you to it.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.326
            Have fun.
            -Okay.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.427
Bye.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.997
    Uh, what's the festival?

16:05.999 --> 16:08.599
   Oh, well, surfing is
   a way of life around here,

16:08.601 --> 16:10.368
   and this year is 100 years

16:10.370 --> 16:12.537
     since Bee's grandmother
     paddled out

16:12.539 --> 16:14.339
    and surfed with the boys.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.341
        Violet was a bit
        of a trailblazer.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.243
So they're throwing her a party.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.611
       That's pretty cool.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.214
          Yeah. It is.
          Now, come on.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.415
          Let's get you
          to your room.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.283
            Uh, okay.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.489
    Nothing much has changed.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.058
       Your drawings are
       still on the wall.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.195
       And I found some of
       your kids' books.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.097
I better get that.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.065
        Uh, the bathroom
        is down the hall.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.434
   The blue towels are yours.
   Make yourself at home.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.372
             Hello?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.741
          How are you?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.649
Why are you knocking?

18:04.651 --> 18:06.317
    You usually just walk in.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.618
        You have a guest.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.520
       Well, should I ask
       what that is?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.289
      It's a welcome gift.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.625
 You know, the ocean, sunshine,
 "Welcome to Australia."

18:14.627 --> 18:18.563
   You're gonna give a girl
   from New York a dead fish?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.832
    Well, now it seems weird.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.678
        Oh! You're purdy.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.546
Owen dropped by
 this morning.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.782
- Again?
-   -Uh-huh.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.651
Margot, you have a girl creeping
outside of your bathroom.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.488
  Oh, that's Chicka. She popped
  in for lunch post-surf.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.256
- 'Sup?
-  -Cora, this is Chicka,

18:45.258 --> 18:47.291
 who thinks my house is a hotel.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.493
      I ate your sandwich.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.861
       Sorry.
       -And this is Tom --

18:49.863 --> 18:52.330
  Blue Soul's surf instructor.

18:52.332 --> 18:56.567
    -How you going?
    -H-How am I going where?

18:56.569 --> 18:57.902
     Did you want a coffee?

18:57.904 --> 18:59.704
          Yes, please.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.610
            Oh. Okay.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.778
        Belinda, no, no,
        no, no, no.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.814
   No chickens in the kitchen.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.215
               Oh!

19:11.217 --> 19:12.750
          Honey, honey.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.286
     -Can you...? Thank you.
     -N-- uh.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.388
- Yeah.
   -Okay, it's...

19:17.390 --> 19:19.824
- So, what did Owen want?
-  -Oh, the usual.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.193
 He wants to buy Blue Soul Surf,

19:22.195 --> 19:25.229
  the kit, you, our contracts.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.565
- And what did you say?
-  -She said yes.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.900
     Owen's your father now.

19:28.902 --> 19:31.435
           I said no.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.838
     Cora, did you want to,
     you know,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.439
    check out the rock pools?

19:35.441 --> 19:37.208
      You used to love them
      when you were a kid.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.676
       Oh, uh, thank you,

19:38.678 --> 19:41.312
   but I should actually
   really check in back home.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.347
     Um, what's your Wi-Fi?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.618
              What?

19:47.620 --> 19:50.588
       Margot doesn't
       have the Internet.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.323
   Doesn't have the Internet?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.225
   Like, i-is that 'cause you
   call it something else --

19:54.227 --> 19:55.960
          kangaroo line
          or something?

19:55.962 --> 19:58.396
     No, I'm just not great
     with things like that.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.831
  Things like the 21st century?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.867
      It's nice not having
      to be connected

20:02.869 --> 20:04.869
    to the rest of the world
    when I'm at home.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.604
        It helps my Zen.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.838
Zen?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.740
      But Tom set up Wi-Fi
      at Blue Soul,

20:09.742 --> 20:13.611
 so you can, you know, pop down
 there whenever you like.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.779
          Great. Yeah.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.448
Uh, I'll just -- I'll go change.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.787
 Are you gonna get changed, too?

20:22.789 --> 20:25.356
'Cause I'm just gonna wear this.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.803
         Popping candy?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.343
Every time I eat them, I just --

21:19.345 --> 21:22.380
    I imagine a bunch of guys
    in suits in a boardroom

21:22.382 --> 21:23.848
  surrounded by takeaway boxes.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.549
         They're tired,

21:25.551 --> 21:27.318
   but then this one guy
   slams his hand on the desk,

21:27.320 --> 21:29.820
          and he says,
          "I got it!

21:29.822 --> 21:31.055
  A candy that when you eat it

21:31.057 --> 21:34.025
       makes the sound
       of frying onions!"

21:34.027 --> 21:35.893
       Then the other guys
       are like, "Wow!

21:35.895 --> 21:38.963
     Yes! Good idea, Steve!"

21:38.965 --> 21:41.532
       Oh, I just -- just
       love popping candy.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.837
   So, who are you talking to?

21:46.839 --> 21:49.473
   I'm not talking to anyone.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.510
     Margot says you're
     a bit of a fashionista.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.313
     Yeah, yeah,
     I'm a model, actually.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.048
             Sweet.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.350
    I know a guy in New York.

21:59.352 --> 22:02.753
       His name's Patrick.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.389
          You know him?

22:05.391 --> 22:07.792
    There are over 8 million
    people in New York.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.527
             Mm-hmm.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.362
     He always wears a hat.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.934
               No.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.969
      I'll let you get back
      to your mates.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.918
Hey, Mom.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.521
   I think I really focused up
   on the plane here.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.423
            So, um...

22:47.033 --> 22:49.367
        I've just been...

22:49.369 --> 22:50.935
      I've been feeling --

22:50.937 --> 22:53.671
            I just...

22:53.673 --> 22:56.807
    Why don't you give me
    a call when you get this?

22:56.809 --> 22:58.676
You've reached
 the office of Sofia Hamilton,

22:58.678 --> 23:00.478
       New York's premiere
       modeling agent.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.046
     Please leave a message.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.651
      Everything all right?

23:07.653 --> 23:11.155
     Yeah. Fine. Just tired.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.499
Max -- e-mail --

23:21.501 --> 23:23.167
  is okay with your short list
  for Wednesday's job.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.103
          -No response.
          -Jennifer --

23:26.105 --> 23:29.140
 cellphone voicemail -- wants --
 -Anything from Cora?

23:29.142 --> 23:32.777
     No. Nothing from Cora.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.078
           What else?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.080
Dobrovski --
  cellphone text --

23:36.082 --> 23:37.515
      "Moved meeting
      to Tuesday morning."

23:37.517 --> 23:40.918
          You're free.
          -Book it in.

23:50.696 --> 23:52.763
          What's wrong?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.865
   Something's bothering Cora.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.600
     I think a code coconut
     is in order.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.437
             Well...

23:59.439 --> 24:00.805
       We'll need helmets.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.707
      Chicka was definitely
      concussed last time.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.454
Batter up!

24:16.456 --> 24:18.055
- They can't be serious.
-   -Come on!

24:18.057 --> 24:19.490
- Whoo!
-  -Yeah, yeah, yeah!

24:19.492 --> 24:21.625
You can't be serious!

24:21.627 --> 24:24.195
              Whoa!

24:24.197 --> 24:25.896
    What am I supposed to do?

24:25.898 --> 24:28.532
    You've got a bat, woman.
    Hit it.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.234
    You could have killed me.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.803
      It's all right.
      We've got helmets on.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.874
       Eye on the coconut.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.909
   It'll make you feel better.
   I promise.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.946
 Aim to hit it from underneath.
 -Better about what?

24:41.948 --> 24:44.782
 Better about whatever you need
 to feel better about.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.650
    Now, go low!
    She's gonna lollipop it!

24:48.554 --> 24:50.521
             -Go!
             -Whoo!

24:50.523 --> 24:53.224
            Come on!

24:53.226 --> 24:54.525
            You run

24:54.527 --> 24:57.628
        You run from me

24:57.630 --> 24:59.063
            Whoo-hoo!

25:04.537 --> 25:07.905
        You run from me

25:07.907 --> 25:09.707
            You run

25:09.709 --> 25:10.741
             You run

25:10.743 --> 25:12.676
        You run from me

25:12.678 --> 25:16.280
         You run from me

25:16.282 --> 25:17.681
            You run

25:17.683 --> 25:18.782
             You run

25:18.784 --> 25:21.085
        You run from me

25:36.702 --> 25:45.042
           'Cause I

25:45.044 --> 25:47.177
          'Cause I know

25:48.781 --> 25:50.781
        You run, you run,
       you run from me

25:50.783 --> 25:53.050
  Come on.
  It's time for the best part!

25:53.052 --> 25:55.119
- Whoo!
-  -Catch you later!

25:55.121 --> 25:58.589
   Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.291
            Come on!

26:00.293 --> 26:03.294
 What about sharks or jellyfish?

26:03.296 --> 26:05.229
      When's the last time
      you went swimming?

26:05.231 --> 26:07.598
          In the ocean?

26:07.600 --> 26:08.866
            As a kid.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.834
      The last time
      I was here, probably.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.002
  Well, then, it's about time.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.572
          It's nice as!

27:21.941 --> 27:25.109
    The air's different here.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.411
  I mean, it's, like, perfume.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.080
      It's a bit different
      from New York, huh?

27:30.082 --> 27:31.882
     Margot said you model.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.318
      Yeah, yeah.
      Teen fashion, mostly,

27:34.320 --> 27:36.153
   but Mom's been
   training me for editorial.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.355
  Training? How hard can it be?

27:38.357 --> 27:39.823
- Chicka.
-    -What?

27:39.825 --> 27:41.358
 You just lie around in clothes.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.229
     I do that all the time.
     I'm doing it right now.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.897
    Yeah, it's -- it's okay.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.399
A lot of people think it's easy.

27:48.401 --> 27:52.002
  It actually requires
  a surprising amount of work.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.204
       Sof must be
       very proud of you.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.206
          Yeah, well...

27:56.208 --> 27:57.841
         I might take
         a break from...

27:57.843 --> 28:00.277
     modeling soon, anyway.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.246
    Yeah, I don't blame you.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.782
   That video was pretty mean.

28:05.418 --> 28:06.850
            I mean...

28:06.852 --> 28:08.786
       It wasn't that bad.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.358
      Yeah, look, there are
      a lot of people

28:14.360 --> 28:17.394
     who work really hard
     to get the cover shoot.

28:17.396 --> 28:21.131
   If you make one mistake,
   even if it's a little one,

28:21.133 --> 28:23.133
   it's the end of the world.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.069
 You know, it seems like you're

28:25.071 --> 28:27.471
    the most important person
    in the room.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.007
  In actuality, you're nobody.

28:34.947 --> 28:38.816
      You can't be perfect
      all the time.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.784
      I know a thing or two
      about making mistakes

28:40.786 --> 28:42.386
in front of a critical audience.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.822
  Oh, yeah.
  Like that time you wiped out

28:44.824 --> 28:46.490
- in the Wahine's Women's Open.
-  -Chicka.

28:46.492 --> 28:49.359
   What? It was in the heats,
   not even the final,

28:49.361 --> 28:52.096
       and she just, like,
       completely ate it.

28:52.098 --> 28:55.132
      Thank you.
      I forgot about that.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.234
 I did wipe out more than once.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.435
Mm-hmm.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.003
But every time I made a mistake,

29:00.005 --> 29:01.405
     I learned something --

29:01.407 --> 29:05.242
  something about my technique
  or my attitude,

29:05.244 --> 29:07.244
          who to trust.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.746
            Exactly.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.814
       And who cares what
       those fancy pantses

29:10.816 --> 29:12.449
   in New York think, anyway?

29:14.754 --> 29:16.019
     I know it sounds silly,

29:16.021 --> 29:19.356
     but where I come from,

29:19.358 --> 29:22.392
    the fashion that we wear,
    it's -- it's just art.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.994
         It's pure art.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.330
       You should see what
       these designers do.

29:26.332 --> 29:30.100
   They don't just buy fabrics
   and follow a pattern.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.469
   I mean, they're architects.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.071
     They -- They research,

29:34.073 --> 29:36.940
   and they're always
   hunting down new materials

29:36.942 --> 29:42.279
 and seeking out ways to make it
 all come together, you know?

29:42.281 --> 29:45.349
   You sound very passionate.

29:45.351 --> 29:49.419
      Yeah, I mean, it's
      just my observations.

29:49.421 --> 29:52.422
 Here's an idea -- Why don't you
 two go for a surf tomorrow?

29:52.424 --> 29:55.292
 It's gonna be a beautiful day.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.561
       Sweet.
       Yeah, let's do it.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.429
          I can't surf.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.098
   Oh, well, that's all right.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.400
   Neither could I before
   I went out the first time.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.277
               Up.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.816
      Upright. Okay.
      Move this back foot.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.484
Breathe in.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.187
 Feel the movement of the water.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.088
   You are a part of the sea.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.824
      You are the current.

30:26.826 --> 30:29.193
      You are a jellyfish.

30:29.195 --> 30:32.229
 You are at one with the ocean.
 You're a dolphin.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.831
 I don't think this is working.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.333
      Oh, well, this is
      how Margot taught me.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.935
    Yeah, speaking of Margot,

30:37.937 --> 30:39.403
     maybe she can come out
     with us next time.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.272
        Open your eyes!
        And go, Cora! Go!

30:42.274 --> 30:44.908
         Paddle! Paddle!

30:47.279 --> 30:50.614
--Yeah, girl!

30:55.321 --> 30:59.623
         Whoo! Go, Cora!

31:14.240 --> 31:17.608
- Hello?
  -Margot.

31:17.610 --> 31:19.977
              Sof.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.880
      Hey, uh, how are you?

31:22.882 --> 31:24.514
              Fine.

31:24.516 --> 31:27.351
 Well, as fine as you can be
 when your daughter skips town.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.119
     Oh, I thought as much.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.055
  Didn't seem like you to push
  for a last-minute holiday.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.460
      I haven't heard
      from you in a while.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.362
I have tried to call.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.199
     Did you get the flowers
     I sent for --

31:42.201 --> 31:43.967
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.937
             Thanks.

31:48.007 --> 31:51.308
     I meant to call back,
     but, well, you know...

31:52.311 --> 31:55.412
        So, Cora grew up.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.014
        She's great, Sof.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.582
    She's -- She's gorgeous.

31:58.584 --> 32:02.319
        Yeah, she is.
        Is she all right?

32:02.321 --> 32:04.021
    Not getting in your way?

32:04.023 --> 32:06.123
   No, no, no, no. Not at all.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.524
       I mean, she was --

32:07.526 --> 32:09.359
   she was a bit out of sorts
   when she arrived,

32:09.361 --> 32:11.395
  but actually,
  she's out surfing right now.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.698
  -Wow. That sounds dangerous.
  -It's strange.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.368
   It's kind of like having
   my teen sister back again.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.037
        How's your, uh --
        How's your work?

32:20.039 --> 32:21.438
    Uh, busy. How about you?

32:21.440 --> 32:25.042
       Yeah, yeah, tied up
       with things here.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.978
  So, have you sold Blue Soul?

32:27.980 --> 32:29.246
      Why would I do that?

32:29.248 --> 32:30.614
I thought
 it wasn't going so well.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.383
      You don't know how
      it's going, actually.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.551
       It's just basic
       business principle.

32:34.553 --> 32:35.953
 It doesn't have to be personal.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.554
    Of course it's personal.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.059
   Isn't that why you deigned
   to visit us last time?

32:42.061 --> 32:43.527
      Because you were
      struggling with work,

32:43.529 --> 32:45.729
and you needed a break?
Because sometimes it's personal.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.364
I'm sorry to cut this short,

32:47.366 --> 32:51.401
     but I'm being hassled
     by my next appointment.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.603
     I just wanted to see
     if Cora was all right.

32:53.605 --> 32:57.307
I'm glad she's okay and that
you're both having fun together.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.976
     I'll talk to you later.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.012
         Okay. Sof, I...

33:04.083 --> 33:05.515
              Sof?

33:11.623 --> 33:14.291
    Cora. You're doing well.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.326
I think Chicka's
 trying to kill me

33:16.328 --> 33:18.028
        and make it look
        like an accident.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.663
 I've seen worse first attempts.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.764
          Well, thanks.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.772
         Who are they?
         -Wave Masters.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.407
     Only other surf school
     in Tea Tree.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.142
Come on, guys. Let's go.
 Come on.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.544
  All right, grab it now.
  Now, let's move it, move it.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.281
Come on, guys. Follow me.
We're heading down to the beach.

33:38.283 --> 33:39.683
        Let's go, go, go.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.752
   Hey, that guy was
   at Margot's the other day.

33:41.754 --> 33:43.453
           Yeah, Owen.

33:43.455 --> 33:46.189
 He's been trying to get Margot
 to sell for a while.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.257
    She's having none of it.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.363
  You want to boost my numbers?

33:53.365 --> 33:56.333
Join my lesson tomorrow?

33:56.335 --> 33:58.368
    Tell you what, if Chicka
    gets taken by a shark,

33:58.370 --> 34:00.170
   you will be my first call.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.647
    Before you say anything,
    this wasn't my idea.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.183
  I didn't want to be the head
  of the festival committee.

34:13.185 --> 34:17.254
  No, Frank, we are not having
  a Guess Your Weight stand.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.789
            Why not?

34:18.791 --> 34:21.725
  Beryl, how much do you weigh?

34:21.726 --> 34:25.195
          -Excuse me.
          -That's why.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.730
     I thought Dolores was
     head of the committee.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.299
   Well, she was until she had
   the nerve to jump ship.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.534
- Dolores has moved?
-  -She's on holiday.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.235
        She's in Cairns.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.638
 The details are not important.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.373
 We just have to band together,

34:36.375 --> 34:38.308
   and if I'm stuck with them,
   you're stuck with them.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.676
  What's wrong with your house?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.245
           Darling!
           Wonderful!

34:42.246 --> 34:44.514
    We need your fashion eye.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.416
      This is the one
      I was talking about.

34:46.418 --> 34:50.120
      She works in fashion
      in New York.

34:50.121 --> 34:53.356
   We are putting together
   a vintage swimsuit display

34:53.358 --> 34:55.592
      that spans 100 years.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.595
    What do you think?
    We can't get it to work.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.364
      It's not supposed
      to hang like a sack.

35:01.366 --> 35:06.269
      Yeah, uh, I don't
      really do this, so...

35:06.271 --> 35:09.506
I'll -- I'll let you guys to it.
-No, no, no, no.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.642
      Don't you worry about
      hurting our feelings.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.611
       What do you think?

35:16.849 --> 35:18.615
        I mean, honestly?

35:18.617 --> 35:21.284
       Yes, yes, darling.

35:23.422 --> 35:25.489
              Hmm.

35:45.878 --> 35:48.378
          Ready, Mommy?

35:50.249 --> 35:53.216
    To begin, I'm gonna need
    a sewing machine.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.922
Now, the idea is to show

35:58.924 --> 36:01.158
      different eras
      of swim wear fashion,

36:01.160 --> 36:02.893
   but all ideas are welcome.

36:02.895 --> 36:05.829
        Aha! Here we go.

36:05.831 --> 36:09.566
           Ohh! Now...

36:09.568 --> 36:11.635
   this was Grandma Violet's,

36:11.637 --> 36:13.603
    given to me by my mother,

36:13.605 --> 36:16.706
  and now I'm giving it to you.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.743
           -Ohh! Ohh!
           -Careful.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.778
        Have fun with it.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.214
            Go wild.
            -Yeah.

36:24.216 --> 36:27.717
   No one's ever really asked
   for my opinion before.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.220
         More fool them.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.421
         Do you got it?
         -Yeah.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.390
         -Shall I help?
         -No. Arm day.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.958
  All right, I'll stand behind
  you in case you drop it.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.642
        Ah, she's flying.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.744
         It's beautiful.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.713
       It's like a dance.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.648
It's 'cause
 they're working together --

37:31.650 --> 37:33.450
       surfer and the sea.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.419
  Can't tell with the wave ends
  and she begins.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.563
 First thing -- We're gonna need
 some awesome surfer girls.

37:46.565 --> 37:47.864
   Can you help me with that?

37:47.866 --> 37:50.033
      Yeah. You're looking
      at one, sister.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.836
            Second...

37:52.838 --> 37:55.939
     Can you keep a secret?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.574
             Sealed.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.582
  Yes, I'll come back to you

38:05.584 --> 38:10.654
         No, I won't ask
        where you run

38:10.656 --> 38:14.357
         Under the sun

38:14.359 --> 38:18.361
  Yes, I'll come back to you

38:18.363 --> 38:23.066
      Then I'll ask,
     "What have we done?"

38:23.068 --> 38:25.535
         Under the sun

39:04.543 --> 39:07.644
     To be free, be awake

39:07.646 --> 39:12.515
       Big breath
      that you can't fake

39:12.517 --> 39:16.519
       Once you've begun

39:16.521 --> 39:19.889
    On the right side,
   coming on the right time

39:19.891 --> 39:22.926
    On the right time,
   coming on the right side

39:22.928 --> 39:25.962
    On the right side,
   coming on the right time

39:25.964 --> 39:29.499
    On the right time,
   coming on the right side

40:19.151 --> 40:22.452
  Thought this might get
  the creative juices flowing.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.944
     These are really good.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.512
           Thank you.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.548
       Do you see them
       in your head first

40:51.550 --> 40:54.050
     and then draw it,
     or does it just happen?

40:54.052 --> 40:56.052
     Yeah, yeah,
     I see them in my head.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.656
 Well -- Or I feel it, actually.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.891
            -Feel it?
            -Yeah.

41:01.893 --> 41:05.161
  I imagine what it would feel
  like if I was wearing it.

41:07.732 --> 41:10.099
- Hello?

41:10.101 --> 41:13.169
       Whoa! And goodbye.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.705
          Chicka, wait.

41:15.707 --> 41:16.840
           Come here.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.144
   I need you to be my model.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.512
              What?

41:22.514 --> 41:24.147
         Little, old me?

41:24.149 --> 41:27.116
I thought you'd never ask.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.655
         It's, uh, nice.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.624
      It's not exactly
      what I was going for.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.227
    Hmm...
    Maybe if I strike a pose.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.963
Ohh! Sorry!

41:39.965 --> 41:43.066
     We need functionality,
     not just aesthetics.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.702
 I could skate down the runway.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.036
Whoo!

41:47.038 --> 41:49.772
              -No!
              -Aah!

43:25.604 --> 43:26.736
Need a hand?

43:26.738 --> 43:29.072
               No.

43:29.074 --> 43:31.007
           Thank you.

43:33.812 --> 43:36.012
        We have a, uh --

43:36.014 --> 43:38.081
   a certain percentage of --

43:38.083 --> 43:42.952
     of customers that will
     only seem to book once.

43:42.954 --> 43:43.987
      Is that a statement,

43:43.989 --> 43:46.356
   or do you want my opinion?

43:46.358 --> 43:47.857
   Well, you've never been one

43:47.859 --> 43:49.692
      to keep your opinion
      to yourself.

43:52.030 --> 43:55.231
       Well, in that case,

43:55.233 --> 43:57.300
      maybe you should stop
      running your lessons

43:57.302 --> 44:01.170
  like a military exercise
  and let people have some fun.

44:01.172 --> 44:04.140
 That's all fun and games until
 someone runs out of business.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.780
          What is this?
          What is it?

44:10.782 --> 44:12.382
 This music --
 I'm nearly falling asleep here.

44:12.384 --> 44:13.883
         It's the blues.

44:13.885 --> 44:16.853
    Yeah, I'll say. Shocking.

44:16.855 --> 44:18.121
         Oh, here we go.

44:18.123 --> 44:20.790
     You're gonna like this.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.095
         That's better.

44:26.097 --> 44:27.764
         We never have,

44:27.766 --> 44:29.432
        and we never will
        agree on music.

44:29.434 --> 44:32.235
            Mm-hmm.
            Come on.

44:32.237 --> 44:33.403
     No. The '90s are over.

44:33.405 --> 44:35.104
 You need to let them go, Owen.

44:35.106 --> 44:36.939
            Come on.

45:15.480 --> 45:19.449
    We had some good times --
    you, me, and Caleb.

45:19.451 --> 45:20.850
              Yeah.

45:20.852 --> 45:23.720
     We were pretty blessed.

45:23.722 --> 45:27.457
  Sometimes I feel like he's --

45:27.459 --> 45:30.193
 I feel like he's slipping away.

45:30.195 --> 45:33.730
  He's still out there, Margs.

45:33.732 --> 45:36.099
      I feel him every time
      I paddle out.

46:17.242 --> 46:18.808
    Hold your horses, kiddo.

46:18.810 --> 46:20.810
     Oh, hey. Just gonna
     go catch up to Margot.

46:20.812 --> 46:23.379
        Why don't you put
        these on instead?

46:23.381 --> 46:25.081
   We-- I would, but she's --

46:25.083 --> 46:28.151
       Margot isn't gonna
       go for a surf.

46:28.153 --> 46:30.052
    Uh, she just walked down.
    I just saw her.

46:30.054 --> 46:33.890
      Well, that's true,
      but she won't go out.

46:33.892 --> 46:35.558
What's she doing, then?

46:35.560 --> 46:38.995
The same thing she's done
 every day for the last year.

46:38.997 --> 46:41.998
      She doesn't go
      in the water anymore.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.535
     Wait, she -- she hasn't
     surfed in a year?

46:45.537 --> 46:47.570
  I thought she was
  a pro surfer -- the trophies.

46:47.572 --> 46:49.539
     Well, she is, darling.

46:49.541 --> 46:52.141
That -- That doesn't make sense.

46:52.143 --> 46:53.976
Sometimes
  when we're hurting,

46:53.978 --> 46:55.211
  the last thing we want to do

46:55.213 --> 46:58.281
      is what will make us
      feel better.

46:58.283 --> 47:03.186
    Is she scared because of
    what happened to Caleb?

47:03.188 --> 47:05.087
        When I was a kid,
        we had this big,

47:05.089 --> 47:06.556
       old eucalyptus tree
       in the garden.

47:06.558 --> 47:08.891
  It was beautiful.
  It had a little magpie in it,

47:08.893 --> 47:11.194
      and every morning,
      it would warble away.

47:11.196 --> 47:12.862
      For five years,
      I was sent to school

47:12.864 --> 47:15.565
      to the sound of that
      happy, little fellow.

47:15.567 --> 47:18.401
  One day, my father got an ax,

47:18.403 --> 47:20.069
  and he chopped the tree down.

47:20.071 --> 47:21.437
        I was devastated.

47:21.439 --> 47:23.906
    No more branches to cast
    shadows on the wall.

47:23.908 --> 47:26.375
       No more Mr. Magpie.

47:26.377 --> 47:27.944
        We got a pool --

47:27.946 --> 47:29.478
  an above-ground monstrosity.

47:29.480 --> 47:32.949
   Well, it was so hot
   the pavements were melting,

47:32.951 --> 47:35.451
       and I still refused
       to get in it.

47:35.453 --> 47:36.919
   Why did you hate the pool?

47:36.921 --> 47:38.487
 Because if I'd got in the pool,

47:38.489 --> 47:41.290
   it would be like I was okay
   with the tree being gone,

47:41.292 --> 47:44.126
       and I wasn't.
       I was still angry.

47:44.128 --> 47:46.095
    But I realized there were
    things to be happy about,

47:46.097 --> 47:49.532
    and that put the sad
    things into perspective.

47:49.534 --> 47:51.300
Things happen and they change us

47:51.302 --> 47:54.270
   and we can't control that.

47:54.272 --> 47:57.907
     What you can control
     is how they change you.

47:59.544 --> 48:01.944
     I'm sorry about Caleb.

48:01.946 --> 48:03.145
      And about your tree.

48:03.147 --> 48:05.181
Oh, don't be.

48:05.183 --> 48:07.650
    Now, 4:00 p.m. tomorrow,
    Chicka says

48:07.652 --> 48:10.353
    she's lined up some girls
    for the fitting.

48:10.355 --> 48:12.488
         Oh, yeah. Uh...

48:12.490 --> 48:15.291
         You'll be fine.
         Walk this way.

48:15.293 --> 48:17.994
      Now -- Now, come over
      here to me,

48:17.996 --> 48:19.629
     and you see up here?
     That's what I'm doing.

48:19.631 --> 48:21.230
     You just nip those off.

48:31.376 --> 48:35.478
- Cora! Whoo!

48:35.480 --> 48:37.113
              -Hey.
              -Hey!

48:37.115 --> 48:39.949
             Yeah!
             -Okay.

48:39.951 --> 48:42.618
Ooh, check it out, girls.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.555
        I thought we were
        getting bikinis.

48:46.557 --> 48:49.692
    No, uh, bikinis weren't
    invented until the '40s.

48:49.694 --> 48:52.395
     Your outfit is inspired
     by the Edwardian Era.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.576
             Ta-da!

49:07.578 --> 49:09.312
       What are you doing?

49:09.314 --> 49:12.048
It's heaps better.
 Now you can see my legs.

49:12.050 --> 49:14.617
 Oh, is it? Is it heaps better?

49:14.619 --> 49:17.353
Well, is there anything else
you'd like to make heaps better?

49:17.355 --> 49:18.688
          No. What? No.

49:18.690 --> 49:20.323
     I didn't realize
     Tea Tree Beach was home

49:20.325 --> 49:22.058
    to such a fashion expert.

49:22.060 --> 49:23.592
   Uh, I just thought that --

49:23.594 --> 49:26.028
   Why don't you take over
   and design the whole thing?

49:26.030 --> 49:28.698
  Come on, Cora.
  She didn't mean to upset you.

49:28.700 --> 49:30.633
       Dressing up is
       supposed to be fun.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.635
        You think this is
        just dress-up?

49:36.074 --> 49:37.373
       What's her problem?

49:39.143 --> 49:40.443
               Ah!

49:40.445 --> 49:42.611
    What's going on in there?

49:42.613 --> 49:44.580
      She ruined my design.

49:44.582 --> 49:47.149
     And talking to her like
     that's gonna fix it?

49:47.151 --> 49:48.985
    She hacked it to pieces.

49:48.987 --> 49:51.187
     Well, I don't know.
     Does she have a point?

49:51.189 --> 49:52.989
      A point?
      It's like you people

49:52.991 --> 49:55.324
     don't know anything
     about beauty or design.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.259
          "You people."

49:57.261 --> 49:58.561
     It's these people
     that have embraced you

49:58.563 --> 50:01.364
    and asked you to help out
    with their festival.

50:01.366 --> 50:03.232
      What have your people
      done for you, Cora?

50:03.234 --> 50:06.402
    Pushed you around,
    spread rumors about you?

50:06.404 --> 50:10.239
  You're right. My people
  are nothing like your people.

50:10.241 --> 50:12.708
     And I'm fine with that.

50:27.158 --> 50:29.625
Thanks,
  but I'm not hungry.

50:29.627 --> 50:33.396
      Well, I'll just leave
      it here, then.

50:33.398 --> 50:37.066
      Aunt Margot, did you
      and Caleb ever fight?

50:40.705 --> 50:42.772
             Never.

50:42.774 --> 50:45.441
Yes.

50:45.443 --> 50:47.410
        Oh, all the time.

50:47.412 --> 50:51.280
   Blue Soul nearly killed us
   more than once.

50:51.282 --> 50:54.550
        Why do you keep
        running it, then?

50:54.552 --> 50:57.787
  It's all I have left of him.

50:57.789 --> 51:00.389
   Is that why you hate Owen?

51:00.391 --> 51:03.526
       I don't hate Owen.

51:03.528 --> 51:05.561
       The three of us
       were great friends.

51:07.532 --> 51:10.699
Owen was there surfing
with Caleb the day that he died.

51:15.506 --> 51:17.106
       I heard the fitting
       didn't go so well.

51:17.108 --> 51:19.341
           Ugh! Yeah.

51:19.343 --> 51:21.744
       I kind of lost it.
       -You're passionate.

51:21.746 --> 51:23.446
    Don't apologize for that.

51:23.448 --> 51:26.782
You just need a bit of patience.

51:29.554 --> 51:31.387
          I don't know.

51:31.389 --> 51:34.590
  I-I constantly just feel like
  I'm saying the wrong thing.

51:34.592 --> 51:38.294
       It takes courage
       to speak your mind.

51:38.296 --> 51:41.697
 Our family makes strong women,
 and you're one of them.

51:41.699 --> 51:44.533
        Be proud of that.

51:46.104 --> 51:47.236
          That chicken.

51:47.238 --> 51:48.804
          Belinda! No!

51:48.806 --> 51:51.507
       Out, out, out,
       or I will cook you!

52:11.696 --> 52:14.630
Chicka. Hey.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.700
      I owe you an apology.

52:17.702 --> 52:19.735
   I'm sorry about yesterday.

52:19.737 --> 52:21.470
You were real mad.

52:21.472 --> 52:24.640
   I thought you might explode
   into a thousand pieces.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.242
             I know.

52:26.244 --> 52:28.911
     Do you think the others
     might forgive me?

52:28.913 --> 52:31.313
  We're going out to surf soon
  if you want to join.

52:31.315 --> 52:33.516
       Yeah, I'd love to.

52:33.518 --> 52:34.917
You looking for Tom?

52:34.919 --> 52:36.785
       He's on the beach.
       And don't worry.

52:36.787 --> 52:39.255
      He's not one to
      bear grudges, either.

52:41.359 --> 52:43.292
              Here.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.662
           Thank you.

53:00.912 --> 53:02.411
              Hey.

53:02.413 --> 53:04.513
Hey.

53:06.584 --> 53:08.951
      They won't hurt you.

53:11.589 --> 53:14.223
              Whoo.

53:14.225 --> 53:17.693
       They're beautiful.
       Whose are they?

53:17.695 --> 53:20.329
           Don't know.

53:23.401 --> 53:25.601
  Hey, listen, I was thinking,

53:25.603 --> 53:29.471
  and I might bring out
  a line of bikinis, after all.

53:29.473 --> 53:30.906
         That's a shame.

53:30.908 --> 53:32.608
      Kind of liked
      the knee-length look.

54:54.825 --> 54:56.592
             Hello?

55:29.694 --> 55:31.427
Hey.

55:31.429 --> 55:32.561
Hey.

55:32.563 --> 55:34.430
    This place is incredible.

55:34.432 --> 55:38.033
    These boards are amazing.

55:38.035 --> 55:40.636
     Margot really wouldn't
     like you being in here.

55:40.638 --> 55:42.938
This is so beautiful.

55:42.940 --> 55:47.776
   I almost thought
   it would have a heartbeat.

55:47.778 --> 55:49.712
It's not finished.

55:49.714 --> 55:52.348
        I need to, um...

55:52.350 --> 55:53.849
    It needs to be finished.

55:53.851 --> 55:55.918
   Wait, is this place yours?

55:55.920 --> 55:58.821
   This was Caleb's workshop.

55:58.823 --> 56:01.357
      Those are his boards.

56:01.359 --> 56:03.492
        This one is mine.

56:05.129 --> 56:08.130
    Wait, you design boards?

56:08.132 --> 56:10.599
        You never asked.

56:12.737 --> 56:15.604
    So, how come you haven't
    finished it, then?

56:17.007 --> 56:19.675
    Can we come out of here?

56:21.812 --> 56:24.480
              Yeah.

56:35.793 --> 56:37.693
     Nice to have you home.

56:37.695 --> 56:39.762
             Mm-hmm.

56:39.764 --> 56:42.464
      It's good to be back.

56:42.466 --> 56:44.633
          Are you sure?

56:44.635 --> 56:47.703
       Sometimes I think
       you prefer touring.

56:48.973 --> 56:51.840
         Are you fishing
         for something?

56:54.011 --> 56:56.478
        I'm proud of you.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.714
     Those waves in Indo --
     They were big.

56:58.716 --> 57:00.182
               Mm.

57:00.184 --> 57:03.852
       And to be honest...

57:03.854 --> 57:06.688
 I was really worried about you.

57:06.690 --> 57:07.890
   You know if it's up to me,

57:07.892 --> 57:11.693
    I will always come home.

57:11.695 --> 57:13.862
            My wife,

57:13.864 --> 57:17.633
    out taming monster waves.

57:29.180 --> 57:31.580
           I love you.

57:54.238 --> 57:56.738
          Ow! Belinda!

57:58.008 --> 57:59.942
           No, no, no.

58:13.824 --> 58:16.058
  Oh, no,
  you're not doing that today.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.726
    Chicka, I really want to.

58:17.728 --> 58:19.495
  Oh, but the surf's too good!

58:19.497 --> 58:21.897
       And everyone's out.

58:21.899 --> 58:23.866
Even some by the name of Thomas.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.904
             Hmm...

58:28.906 --> 58:31.173
Well, we better get going, then.

58:31.175 --> 58:32.908
Let's go.

59:36.807 --> 59:39.875
   Um, this is very isolated.

59:39.877 --> 59:41.243
      Should I be worried?

59:41.245 --> 59:44.646
      No. It is a bit weird
      around here, though.

59:44.648 --> 59:47.349
  When I was a kid, I thought
  a witch lived in these rocks.

59:47.351 --> 59:49.785
      My brothers told me
      stories about her --

59:49.787 --> 59:51.720
     how she drowned sailors

59:51.722 --> 59:55.857
    and rode whales
    to the bottom of the sea.

59:55.859 --> 59:57.826
  Have you told me that before?

59:57.828 --> 01:00:00.095
         Don't think so.

01:00:04.702 --> 01:00:06.001
         It's cool, huh?

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:10.272
Cora Hamilton!

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:16.011
       So, you still want
       to make boards?

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:19.615
    Sort of forgotten
    about them, to be honest.

01:00:19.617 --> 01:00:23.151
 I haven't been in the workshop
 for about a year.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.720
         Do you miss it?

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:28.023
        Yeah. Yeah, I do.

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:31.126
 I love starting with nothing
 and seeing it sort of reveal --

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.162
      Reveal itself to you.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:38.033
      Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.269
          I don't know.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.772
      It kind of seemed
      like he was in there

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:45.841
     waiting to be finished.

01:00:45.843 --> 01:00:48.043
     -Who?
     -Your unfinished board.

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:49.778
 It's like he was just in there,

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.180
  waiting for you to come back
  in and finish him up.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:53.348
       It's a "he," is he?

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.417
           Well, yeah.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.686
     Well, a woman wouldn't
     wait around like that.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:05.193
          You did that.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:06.762
              What?

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:10.065
   You don't remember, do you?

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:12.067
       Wait, that was you?

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:13.702
   You were that annoying boy

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:15.203
  that I used to chase around?

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:18.206
              Yes!

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.008
  -So I have been here before.
  -Mm-hmm.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.977
       And you've told me
       that story before.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:24.212
      You tried to scare me
      with the witch.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.947
 Bet you can't catch me anymore.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:31.753
Okay.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.392
              Huh.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.728
 So a guy can wait around, then.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.397
      I wasn't waiting for
      you to come back,

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.466
      but I'm glad you did.

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:14.262
   Hello, you've reached 1955.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.733
      There's no Internet
      but great gas prices.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.735
Darling, it's me.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:22.871
- Mom?
-   -How are you?

01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:24.840
- Good. Great.
-   -That's good.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:27.275
       It's lovely
       to hear your voice.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:29.244
        Yeah. Yours, too.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.412
I have to
  say the apartment

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.114
   is very quiet without you.

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:34.516
       But I have some
       very exciting news.

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:36.084
           What's up?

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.886
Well, I've been
  working like a dog

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:40.522
    to get you that contract,
    and guess what.

01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:42.224
 Morgana wants you to launch her

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:44.292
   upcoming New York campaign.

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:48.897
      So, uh, wait,
      what does this mean?

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:51.133
This means
  you have a new chance,

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:52.934
      and I think your trip
      to Australia has

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.403
   actually been a good thing
   for both of us --

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:58.240
  a new perspective, some time
  away to work things out.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:00.475
  But you'll need to come home
  as soon as possible.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:02.511
     Lily is booking flights
     as we speak.

01:03:02.513 --> 01:03:04.045
       We can get you
       on a plane tonight.

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:05.981
          Wh-- Tonight?

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:09.050
 Th-- That's so soon. I-I can't.

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:11.453
Morgana wants
  to see you on Tuesday.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:13.522
     Look, I'm sure
     the schedule is tight,

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:16.458
  but there's this festival --

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.127
This is a chance for you
to wipe your slate clean,

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.263
 and I want to help you do that.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:23.298
     Lily will send through
     the flight details.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.900
   Oh, my appointment's here.
   I got to run.

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:26.334
       Call me on your way
       to the airport.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.937
          Bye, darling.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:50.992
      I can't believe this.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:52.594
              What?

01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:59.334
  That I actually thought that
  I could stay here, have this.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:02.871
           Have what?

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:04.873
        That was my mom.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.508
 My modeling contract's back on,

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:09.344
        so I have to go
        back to New York.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:12.113
         You're leaving?

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:17.285
     I was always gonna have
     to leave eventually.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.921
    You -- You get some
    modeling thing and you --

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.156
             you go?

01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:23.024
      It's not just
      some modeling thing.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.427
   I mean, it's --
   it's a really big contract.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:26.628
           You know...

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:29.965
    If that's what you want.

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:31.433
   I've worked years for this.

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:33.068
I thought modeling
 made you unhappy.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.570
   It does. Sometimes. But --

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:37.973
- But what?
  -I'm not like you.

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:40.242
      I can't just give up
      a good opportunity

01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:43.178
    because it got too hard.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.946
      What does that mean?

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:54.022
     It means the keys
     aren't locked up, Tom.

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:55.924
  Okay, nothing is stopping you
  from going in there

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:58.493
    and finishing that board.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:02.097
              Tom.

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:09.571
       Hey. What's wrong?

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.944
      I got the contract
      with Morgana Ferzari.

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:18.013
     Well, congratulations.

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:23.919
     But what about design?

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.321
    I'm really sick of people
    telling me what is

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:28.657
   and is not my dream,
   especially when no one here

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:30.225
   has the courage to actually
   do what they love.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:31.626
         I'm just saying
         don't be afraid

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:33.161
  to do the thing
  that's gonna make you happy.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.665
    Yeah, says the pro surfer
    who doesn't even surf.

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:39.067
    Look, I walk around
    this place and Blue Soul,

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:42.537
    and it's like I can
    almost still feel Caleb.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:46.408
     But it's this dark
     and sad version of him.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:48.710
 It's so heavy. No wonder you're
 afraid to get in the water.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:50.412
      You'll probably sink.

01:05:50.414 --> 01:05:52.047
       I lost my husband.

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:54.582
      Yeah, you don't want
      to sell the school,

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:56.051
  but you don't want to run it.

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:57.385
       You don't want Tom
       to work with Owen,

01:05:57.387 --> 01:05:59.654
     but you don't want him
     to work for you.

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:01.523
     It's like you're stuck.

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:05.694
    Why don't you look around
    and see all of the people

01:06:05.696 --> 01:06:07.696
      who are willing to be
      stuck with you?

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.155
       Whoa. Sorry, miss.

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.157
     This is way too heavy.
     You can't take this.

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.425
          We got to go.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:38.693
       Miss, we've a storm
       front coming in.

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:41.062
       Are you on or off?

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:42.630
        What do you want?

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.779
Margot!

01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:33.181
             Margot?

01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:36.751
             Margot!

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:50.265
           Wait, Tom.

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.800
        I couldn't do it.

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:53.201
         I couldn't go.

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:54.536
          I'm so scared

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.271
       because I feel like

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:59.441
 I may have just ruined
 the best things I've ever had.

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:06.081
     You haven't ruined it.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:20.194
 I've got to go check the boats.
 There's a storm coming.

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:22.096
  Can you find Margot, tell her
  I'll meet her at Blue Soul?

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:23.832
            -Yeah.
            -Mm-hmm?

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.412
             Margot.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:42.884
Her board.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.384
I love you.

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:46.915
Caleb.

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:53.648
             Margot!

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:03.625
             Margot!

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.669
             Margot!

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.322
Are you sure?

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.691
       So she didn't even
       board the plane?

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:15.029
          Yeah, I see.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:17.865
   Yes, I will notify Morgana.

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:20.535
        Yeah, good night.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.986
- Ready, mommy?
-   -We're ready.

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:43.925
       It's going to be
       my new party dress.

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:46.561
Wow, darling,
  it's certainly unique.

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:47.795
It's wonderful.

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:49.864
    You're so creative, Cora.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.766
      Is that sticky tape?

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:54.135
  Yep, and I used staples, too.

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:56.070
          It's perfect.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:58.840
      Can you make me one?
      -But you're a giant.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:02.143
Now, come on, model it
 for us. Come on, darling.

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:05.012
       Keep your shoulders
       back and chin up.

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:07.415
  Chin up.
  Look like you're having fun.

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:09.450
       Smile, Cora. Smile.

01:13:09.452 --> 01:13:10.752
    You beam when you smile.

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:13.087
      I just wanted to show
      you what I made.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:14.555
And it's fabulous.

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:16.924
Sof, I don't think she wants to.

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:18.459
Do it properly.

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:20.128
 Cora, do it like we practiced.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.863
         Walk like this.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:23.164
         Here. Copy me.

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.499
           Good girl.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.667
      Oh, you pretty girl.

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:29.737
 I don't want to do it anymore.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:59.066
   I didn't think I would ever
   be ready to say goodbye.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:03.137
       I'm surrounded by
       people who love me

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:06.607
       and this life that
       we built together.

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:11.078
     And I'm gonna be okay.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:15.183
  So I'm letting you go, honey.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.304
     Okay, girls,
     time to get dressed up.

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:45.039
     Chicka, boards sorted?
     -Yes.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.807
      -And no one saw you?
      -None.

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:49.944
  Ooh, except for Belinda,
  but we have an understanding.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:56.050
      Ladies and gentlemen,
      girls and boys,

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:58.119
  welcome to the main event --

01:15:58.121 --> 01:16:02.056
   the vintage fashion show
   designed by Cora Hamilton.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:05.026
- Take it away!

01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:07.895
      Okay. Just have fun.

01:16:10.767 --> 01:16:13.267
    And if I close my eyes

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:16.037
         I can taste it,
        can't erase it

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:20.641
      Some things are
     meant to last forever

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:25.646
    Some hearts, they burn
   like a wildfire, wildfire

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:27.815
       Keep wishing
      I could set it free

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:29.817
         Some things you
        can't release

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:35.323
      Burning, burning like
     a wildfire, wildfire

01:16:41.698 --> 01:16:45.366
       Keep wishing
      I could set it free

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:53.074
       Keep wishing
      I could set it free

01:16:53.076 --> 01:16:57.378
         We live forever
        in my fantasy

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:02.216
        Boys like you,
       and girls like me

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.318
   Can't find the words and

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.654
       I can't escape it

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:08.356
         Boys like you

01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:10.758
       And girls like me

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.927
   And when you held my hand

01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:15.229
 Electricity was raining down

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:17.231
    Can you hear that sound

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.900
   Light a match,
  we're burning up this town

01:17:19.902 --> 01:17:21.902
    And if I close my eyes

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:24.338
         I can taste it,
        can't erase it

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:33.781
      Some things are meant
     to last forever

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:38.986
    Some hearts, they burn
   like a wildfire, wildfire

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:40.921
       Keep wishing
      I could set it free

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:43.057
         Some things you
        can't release

01:17:43.059 --> 01:17:47.862
      Burning, burning like
     a wildfire, wildfire

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:51.098
        All right, girls,
        are you ready?

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.334
           -Yeah.
           -Let's go.

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:56.270
       Keep wishing
      I could set it free

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.342
       Keep wishing
      I could set it free

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.678
  Another time, another place

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.446
      I see your eyes
     in a stranger's face

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:07.148
        And I'm frozen

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:10.184
        Frozen, frozen

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.318
      How could we know?

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.887
       How could we see?

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:14.722
       How beautiful
      that this could be

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:19.894
       I'm frozen, frozen,
      frozen, frozen

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:51.826
      Some things are meant
     to last forever

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:56.330
    Some hearts, they burn
   like a wildfire, wildfire

01:18:56.332 --> 01:19:00.501
      Some hearts are meant
     to last together

01:19:00.503 --> 01:19:05.306
    Some hearts, they burn
   like a wildfire, wildfire

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:08.175
    What are you doing here?

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.845
      I came to apologize.

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:14.381
  For not listening to you
  when you needed to be heard.

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:18.853
      Mom, my heart isn't
      in modeling anymore.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:20.387
      But that doesn't mean
      that I don't love you

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:23.491
    and appreciate everything
    you've done for me.

01:19:23.493 --> 01:19:26.761
 When someone runs headlong
 into the ocean during a storm,

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:29.830
 rather than getting on a plane
 to fame and fortune,

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:31.899
     I guess they're trying
     to tell you something.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:36.370
      I'm so proud of you.

01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:49.416
Deep down, I think I knew
modeling wasn't your first love.

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:52.153
    But you're my first love.

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:54.188
   And I wanted you to be
   as close to me as possible

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:57.158
    for as long as possible.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.260
      You know, designing's
      no walk in the park.

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:02.463
  You've just jumped from
  the frying pan into the fire.

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:04.031
             I know.

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:05.833
        And I can't wait.

01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:07.334
              Cora!

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:10.337
   My friend Patrick liked
   your designs on Instagram!

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:11.972
    Wait, Patrick Delamore?!

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:14.408
     Yeah! Yeah, I told you.

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:16.343
   He's one of the most iconic
   fashion photographers

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:17.878
          of our time.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.280
 Oh, so you do know Patty Cakes?

01:20:19.282 --> 01:20:20.881
 Hey, I'll give you his number.

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:22.449
      Maybe he'll post
      some of your clothes.

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:25.119
Let's go!

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:29.323
              Sof.

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:51.612
What are they doing?

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.480
Something they should
 have done ages ago.

01:20:53.482 --> 01:20:55.049
   Margot's selling Blue Soul?

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:58.085
 No. They're gonna join forces.

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:00.421
     Margot's starting a pro
     surf school for women,

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:02.156
     like she always wanted,

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:05.526
    and Owen is taking over
    the day-to-day students.

01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:10.898
      Now, close your eyes.

01:21:16.939 --> 01:21:22.309
  Still I ran in the opposite

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:24.278
It's for you.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.947
Tom, it's beautiful.

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:31.085
      Thank you.
      - Until I realized

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:32.486
     Welcome to my workshop!

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:35.189
       Doesn't matter
      where you're going

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:41.562
      Baby, I'm just
     making my way back to

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:43.631
      Making my way back

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:45.266
        Life is always

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:47.534
      Making my way back

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:52.106
        Just to realize

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:54.208
     So, I've been speaking

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.511
      to some colleagues
      about design school.

01:21:57.513 --> 01:22:00.114
 There are some great ones here.

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:01.982
  I'm right ahead of you both.

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:04.218
   I've already been accepted
   into college.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:06.387
       -Congratulations!
       -That's fantastic!

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:10.658
    Yeah, I got into one
    in New York and one here.

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.226
             And...?

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:13.661
      What did you choose?

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:17.197
      Let's get out there!

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:19.233
              Cora!

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:27.641
            Rewind

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:35.316
   Then I can see your face

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:50.331
      We all want to change
     this feeling

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:59.540
      We're all gonna waste
     this feeling

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:06.146
      We all want to change
     this feeling

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:15.990
      We won't ever change
     this feeling

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:28.569
  Leave this feeling tonight

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:47.087
      We all want to change
     this feeling

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:55.229
      We won't ever change
     this feeling

01:26:40.305 --> 01:26:46.567
