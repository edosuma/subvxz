<i>  Two leaders quickly emerged.</i>

03:46.594 --> 03:49.628
<i>  Gasoline</i>
<i>  and corn based ethanol.</i>

03:49.630 --> 03:53.599

and you was limited, how much
gas you could get.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.417

-Back then--
-they'd do this then too.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.853
Yeah. Back then,
a whole lot of guys
did that.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.555
The bootleggers didn't have
no problem with gas.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.390

talking.
-It was--.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.392

happens like the great
depression.

07:07.394 --> 07:10.529
No, now the great depression,
that's my dad's time.
That's way back then.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.497
Did they have gas back then?

07:12.499 --> 07:14.599
They didn't have to
need no gas, they had horses.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.902
-They had to feed them corn.
-[howard laughing]

07:16.904 --> 07:18.303
so, corn makes
the world go around.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.871
Corn went straight
to the horse.

07:19.873 --> 07:23.842
Now, we make the corn
to make gasoline
to go to the motorized horse.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.043

09:01.008 --> 09:02.908
Put that fire to it
and see what happens.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.143
So, we got to take
them precautions.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.046
I ain't fixin' to get my eyes
burned up again.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.581
Light it up, jerry.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.916
Let's see what happens here.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.951
<i>  We're gonna put a fire</i>
<i>  in there</i>

09:12.953 --> 09:14.085
just to see
if it's gonna burn.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.393
Bang!

09:21.995 --> 09:23.862
-You got me.
-No flames.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.597
That's a good thing.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.566
Means we are ready to put this
core in and solder it up.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.001
Let's get something
accomplished.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.804
You know, me and jerry,
we done had
a tough start to our season.

09:32.806 --> 09:33.972
We lost a lot of liquor.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.774
We're broke and

09:35.776 --> 09:37.142
we ain't got nothing
started yet.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.443
We'll see how she's gonna
fit up here.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.913
Oh, yes.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.748
You know, this still
should have been done by now.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.417
I feel like
I'm spinning my wheels.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.885
We've got to get this thing
in the woods

09:46.887 --> 09:48.353
and get some liquor making.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.922
Screwing down
nice and tight here.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.790
Ain't it?

09:51.792 --> 09:52.857
The bottom side done,

09:52.859 --> 09:54.593
we'll be ready to
roll to the woods.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.694
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  this barrel we're using</i>

09:55.696 --> 09:58.096
it's gonna be both our
mash barrel and our still pot.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.631
<i>  We're gotta make sure,</i>
<i>  we've got a way to access</i>

09:59.633 --> 10:00.498
and clean this thing out

10:00.500 --> 10:02.968
and get our materials
into this barrel.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.136
So, we're gonna cut about
a 4-inch hole
in the top of it.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.540
There we go.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.275
This hole right here
is actually going to be

10:10.277 --> 10:12.544
our cap, where our alcohol
gonna condense

10:12.546 --> 10:14.779
and work over
to our condenser.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.882
Also, it's gonna serve as our
port to get our ingredients in

10:17.884 --> 10:18.817
and get it started up,

10:18.819 --> 10:20.752
because we got a mash in
inside this barrel.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.788
Probably, the smallest
damn cap in history.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.991
With this cap built,
it fits like a glove.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.726
I'll be surprised

10:27.828 --> 10:29.794
if we even had
to put any paste around it.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.929
It's one hell of a unique cap,
ain't it.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.764
Damn right. It'll work.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.866
Now that we've got
our still built,

10:34.868 --> 10:36.801
all me and jerry's got to do
is figure out

10:36.803 --> 10:38.970
how in hell we're gonna
put a fire under
this damn thing,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.872
without burning the wood up

10:40.874 --> 10:43.408
and make damn sure we don't
blow ourselves up no more.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.744
We got it, we got it
ready to heat now.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.212
We just need a way to heat it.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.491
Not in the last 2-3 hours,
nobody at all?

10:59.493 --> 11:00.825
There's no way
you can check to see

11:00.827 --> 11:03.528
if the feds have brought
anybody in for me
and give me a callback.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.764
You know, we got connections
all over the county.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.633
<i>  First thing, I did was make</i>
<i>  a couple phone calls,</i>

11:08.635 --> 11:09.801
trying to find out
what's going on.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.736
Holler back at me, all right?

11:11.738 --> 11:13.938
Can you bring anybody in
up at the county jail.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.107
Now, I tried to call josh,
I tried to call tickle.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.575
I don't have brian's number.

11:17.577 --> 11:18.410
No answer.

11:18.412 --> 11:20.545
He and I we made it
back to the shop,

11:20.547 --> 11:21.946
but tickle, josh, brian,

11:21.948 --> 11:24.015
you know, I'm really concerned
about them.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.717
I hope the feds
ain't got them.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.886
It's obviously
something went wrong,

11:27.888 --> 11:29.054
you know, we don't know what.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.289
It's time to take a drink,
my nerves are torn to pieces.

11:44.004 --> 11:44.869
You the first one
spotted them.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.304
I heard you holler
someone's coming

11:46.306 --> 11:47.706
-across the bridge.
-I knew in my head,

11:47.708 --> 11:49.607
I had the feeling
we got out of the truck,
what did I tell you?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.076
I said, here me,
I got a bad feeling.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.645
-I don't know why.
-[speaking indistinctly]

11:53.680 --> 11:54.946
man, what the hell.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.852
I had the feeling
we got out of the truck,
what did I tell you?

12:00.854 --> 12:02.854
I said, here me,
I got a bad feeling.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.223
-I don't know.
-[speaking indistinctly]

12:05.892 --> 12:06.925
man, what the hell.

12:06.927 --> 12:07.926
I know, man!

12:07.928 --> 12:09.894
-God!
-Damn thing!

12:09.896 --> 12:11.463
Yeah, it is good see you.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.664
You could plan all [beep]

12:12.666 --> 12:16.735
what you know,
I had to find
my way back, man.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.837
Yeah, look at that,
look at that,
what are you talking about?

12:18.839 --> 12:22.006
When I looked up
and these guys
was hollering, "freeze".

12:22.008 --> 12:24.375
First thing that went through
my mind was,

12:24.945 --> 12:26.811
I ain't going back to jail.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.047
You got a shot to liquor
around here or something.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.749
-We might got some of that.
-I need one of them.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.118
We've been talking to tickle
for the past couple years.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.786
<i>  We've been working together.</i>

12:34.788 --> 12:35.854
We've been
drilling in his head,

12:35.856 --> 12:37.088
how to get away.

12:37.090 --> 12:37.956
What to do if you get raided.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.691
Tickle you got away.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.660
Evidently, the stuff that we
put in his head,

12:42.662 --> 12:45.263
he listened and he listened
real well.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.065
I know you was
on the, sort of,
the outside,

12:47.067 --> 12:49.567
but josh and brian
was in that middle,

12:49.569 --> 12:50.769
right behind me.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.771
-Right in that hole.
-Yeah, they was hung.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.774
They was tied up
and a guy,
ran by me.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.942
-He was focused.
-He done zoomed in on them.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.577
Didn't even look over our way.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.412
He never even
turned towards us.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.549
All I can say is
if one of them
did get caught,

13:04.551 --> 13:06.951
our first run
of the damn season,

13:07.721 --> 13:09.420
bail money ain't gonna be
easy to come by.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.091
-Oh, oh, oh.
-Oh.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.760
-This, he gotta sandwich.
-He gotta sandwich.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.162
You were at the store.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.697
-Ah!
-I'd like it to
pass it to you.

13:19.699 --> 13:20.832
Good to see you.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.300
It is glad to see
somebody I know.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.601
Oh, my god.

13:23.603 --> 13:24.969
Where's joshua?

13:25.839 --> 13:27.405
-Don't know, now.
-I don't know.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.373
Close the damn door.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.176
<i>  Kinda damn nerve-racking,</i>
<i>  ain't it?</i>

13:41.988 --> 13:42.754
Pretty good looking shop,
ain't it.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.189
It is.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.757
Looks like they've got plenty
of stuff to work with in here.

13:45.759 --> 13:46.858
Oh, my gosh, yeah.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.992
Today, here
at this metal shop,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.627
we're actually gonna build,
what we call a rocket elbow.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.497
That's where we're gonna
heat our wooden barrel
for our still.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.798
Let's go in here and see
if we can find michael.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.266
-I'll show you around
a little bit.
-Right.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.402
How's it going, jerry?

13:57.404 --> 13:58.403
Been doing good, man.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.137
-How you?
-You're in town.

13:59.139 --> 13:59.737
Yeah, man.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.039
Mike, this is mike.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.941
You know, this metal shop here
that we're at today,

14:02.943 --> 14:03.741
it's pretty special to me.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.743
I worked here for almost
13 years.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.847
We've got a little project
we're working on here.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.815
Me and mike's gonna build
a rocket elbow

14:10.817 --> 14:11.749
and so basically
we're needing some

14:11.751 --> 14:12.917
4 x 4 square tubing,

14:12.919 --> 14:14.652
and then our legs
we'll find some

14:14.654 --> 14:15.987
inch and a half,
inch and a quarter.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.689
So, what we'd like to do
is put some, like,
three-inch circles here,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.858
maybe some four-inch circles
on the bottom,

14:19.860 --> 14:21.759
where we just weld on
to keep it from sinking
up in the mud.

14:21.761 --> 14:22.927
We can do it.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.596
Do you use that plasma cutter?
Does it still burn?

14:24.598 --> 14:26.931
You know, if we use
the normal propane
burner on a wooden barrel,

14:26.933 --> 14:28.666
I think it will just catch
fire and burn.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.034
Rocket elbow,
what it's gonna do is

14:30.036 --> 14:31.903
it's gonna be able
to heat this core

14:31.905 --> 14:33.004
from the inside out.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.706
[narrator]
<i>  a rocket stove burns</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:37.308
<i>  wood at extremely</i>
<i>  high temperatures</i>

14:37.310 --> 14:41.279
<i>  with near total combustion</i>
<i>  and almost no smoke.</i>

14:41.281 --> 14:45.617
<i>  The secret to its efficiency</i>
<i>  lies in its elbow design,</i>

14:45.619 --> 14:50.622
<i>  which draws a large volume</i>
<i>  of oxygenated fresh air</i>
<i>  through its intake tube,</i>

14:50.624 --> 14:54.626
<i>  and into direct contact</i>
<i>  with the burning fuel.</i>

14:54.628 --> 14:57.629
<i>  As heat from the fire rises</i>
<i>  into the heat pipe,</i>

14:57.631 --> 15:00.598
<i>  a strong upward draft</i>
<i>  is created,</i>

15:00.600 --> 15:04.702
<i>  causing more air to be pulled</i>
<i>  into the intake pipe.</i>

15:04.704 --> 15:07.972
<i> Its name comes from the rocket</i>
<i>  sound caused by the air</i>

15:07.974 --> 15:10.408
<i>  quickly rushing through</i>
<i>  the intake tube</i>

15:10.410 --> 15:12.110
<i>  and stoking the flames.</i>

15:13.146 --> 15:14.746
We're gonna get the cutting,
how about that.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.880
<i> [jerry] sounds good.</i>

15:15.882 --> 15:17.749
We're cutting out
all of our flanges

15:17.751 --> 15:19.717
and our feet for our stand

15:19.719 --> 15:21.986
to actually put our
rocket burner on.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.255
That's what this plasma cutter
is here for.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.128
That beats the heck
out of a grinder

15:30.130 --> 15:31.029
and a cutting torch...

15:31.031 --> 15:31.930
-You ain't kidding.
-It certainly does.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.965
<i>  The circles we're gonna</i>
<i>  cut out today.</i>

15:33.967 --> 15:35.533
Basically, some bigger circles
for the feet

15:35.535 --> 15:36.734
to set on the ground,

15:37.070 --> 15:39.570
<i>  the other one's gonna be</i>
<i>  to help support the barrel.</i>

15:39.572 --> 15:42.040
The plasma cutter
is phenomenal, it's awesome.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.108
<i>  It makes short work</i>
<i>  of anything,</i>

15:44.110 --> 15:47.045
where it would take us half
a day or a whole day to do.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.047
It takes three minutes.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.783
This barrel, it's actually,
it's gonna
just sit on the stand.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.851
Then we'll put our legs
on here.

15:53.853 --> 15:54.986
That's where our barrel's
gonna sit.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.558
<i> [jerry] this design we're</i>
<i>  using in this rocket elbow,</i>

16:00.560 --> 16:02.694
<i>  basically it just works</i>
<i>  on old technology</i>

16:02.696 --> 16:04.062
and most people call
it the chimney effect.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.164
So, everybody knows
that heat rises.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.666
<i>  So, if you get a fire built</i>

16:08.668 --> 16:10.168
<i>  and you channel</i>
<i>  it in one direction,</i>

16:10.170 --> 16:11.369
it has nowhere else to go
but up,

16:11.371 --> 16:12.870
it actually creates a vacuum.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.806
<i>  Well, that vacuum is gonna</i>
<i>  actually add oxygen</i>

16:14.808 --> 16:16.975
to a fire and make it hotter.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.276
So, there we go,
there's our burner.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.410
Our wood feed here,

16:19.412 --> 16:21.412
while this gonna be
our fresh air in come,

16:21.414 --> 16:24.082
our actual flame and our heat
will take place right here.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.583
It will travel through
the tube

16:25.585 --> 16:26.718
and then up to the flue.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.653
<i>  And mike is working</i>
<i>  on the frame,</i>

16:28.655 --> 16:30.188
<i>  we will be making liquor</i>
<i>  before we know it.</i>

16:30.757 --> 16:31.656
You know, I'm a welder myself.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.792
I'm no stranger to working
in a metal shop.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.794
<i>  You know, it feels good to be</i>
<i>  able to put hands on</i>

16:36.796 --> 16:39.630
and cut stuff, fit stuff
and get it all welded up.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.898
Jerry, I hope this
rocket elbow

16:40.900 --> 16:43.001
does what we think
it will, buddy.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.635
Man, I have
a good feeling about it.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.071
This kinda reminds me a lot
of our column still,

16:47.073 --> 16:48.940
you know, it's something
that's never been done before,

16:48.942 --> 16:49.707
at least not that we know of.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.209
Park it.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.710
I think we're better
to set her on the legs,
ain't we?

16:52.712 --> 16:53.745
All right.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.713
<i>  You know, I am damn</i>
<i>  well hoping this works.</i>

16:55.715 --> 16:57.715
<i>  I know it's gonna get hot,</i>
<i>  it's gonna burn.</i>

16:57.717 --> 16:59.784
But I'm worried we gonna burn
something down.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.886
That son of a bitch
ought to burn
hotter than a nanny goat

17:01.888 --> 17:04.022
in a pepper patch
picking six rows at a time.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.390
That's pretty damn hot, son.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.824
The next step, all we gotta do

17:06.826 --> 17:08.693
is to set this thing up
on the stand,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.061
mash it in and we're done.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.195
We're ready for the season.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.032
[mike laughs]

17:27.914 --> 17:28.346
ah-ha.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.050
All right.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.484
-All right, howard.
-All right.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.952
Going in the woods man.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.421
I know what I'm supposed to do
from here, old buddy.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.422
Yeah.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.957
Today is the day
we're gonna make gasohol.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.826
<i>  We don't know how long this</i>
<i>  gas shortage is gonna last.</i>

17:41.828 --> 17:42.660
<i> [howard] lord have mercy.</i>

17:42.662 --> 17:44.629
I'm thinking right up
in here, howard.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.998
But, I'm pretty sure this is
probably gonna happen again.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Same as it happened
back in the '70s.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.201
You reckon the mash is ready?

17:50.303 --> 17:50.902
I think so.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.770
So, we got to be prepared.

17:52.772 --> 17:53.971
-Look at it right there.
-Beautiful.

17:53.973 --> 17:54.906
That's ready, man.

17:54.908 --> 17:55.773
That's delicious.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.108
That's it, mother's milk.

17:57.110 --> 17:57.975
All right,
let's get this thing set up.

17:57.977 --> 17:58.810
All right.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.513
The higher the alcohol level
we get,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.916
the less water content
we have.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.717
Which should be more efficient
to running an engine.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.020
This could be the start
to something very explosive.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.721
So we're gonna redistill
this a few times,

18:10.723 --> 18:11.889
separate the water from it

18:11.891 --> 18:14.725
<i>  to try to get the alcohol up</i>
<i>  as high as possible,</i>

18:14.727 --> 18:15.927
man that does look good.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.728
But now, we still gonna have
to experiment.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.863
There's different engines
out there.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.299
There's different engines
and different vehicles.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.401
<i>  So, we may have a mix it</i>
<i>  with gasoline</i>

18:23.403 --> 18:26.637
to get a happy medium
that will go into everyone's.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.405
Excuse me there, sir.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.006
Make sure it don't turn over.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.842
[howard]
going from mash to gas.

18:30.844 --> 18:31.709
[tim] mash gas.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.010
[howard] mash gas.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.785
[tim]
now, we gotta light it up.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.019
[howard] add a little fire
to her.

18:42.822 --> 18:43.287
[howard] you got her?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.189
Oh, she's jumping.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.826
[tim] I mean seriously,
what we're doing
is a good deed, man.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.728
It's kind of crazy
when people are trying

18:50.730 --> 18:51.863
to get all this gas,
you know.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.065
Well, it's ridiculous,
I've seen a woman

18:54.067 --> 18:55.967
at a gas station,
on tv though.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.569
She's pouring in a bag,
a plastic bag

18:58.571 --> 18:59.504
filling up,
trying to tie it.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.906
When she goes
to put it in her trunk,

19:01.908 --> 19:04.542
not smart enough to understand
that gasoline
will eat through the plastic,

19:04.544 --> 19:06.344
dumps gas on the back
of her trunk.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.912
-Anyway, this thing--
-then she gets another bag

19:07.914 --> 19:08.980
and goes trying
to fill that one up.

19:08.982 --> 19:09.914
-Double bag it.
-[laughs]

19:09.916 --> 19:11.149
yeah, she gonna double bag.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.117
I can't wait to run this
in your truck.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.552
About that,

19:14.554 --> 19:17.722
what I do think
we should consider first

19:17.724 --> 19:19.590
is possibly running it
in something a little smaller.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.892
Something that is, you know...

19:20.894 --> 19:22.927
-I don't wanna waste it.
-Not a $25,000 vehicle.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.729
Proof of small concept,

19:24.731 --> 19:25.830
then we move
to the big leagues.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.899
I don't mind
running it in mine.

19:27.901 --> 19:28.866
But, I don't wanna be
the first guy to do it.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.935
Ain't your truck flex-fuel?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.770
You're gonna flex my engine
right out to dadgum.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.105
Motor mounts.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.140
I'm telling you man,
I don't want this thing

19:36.142 --> 19:37.408
to blow through the hood.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.776
Look how it's running.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.944
That's a perfect stream
too man.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.779
Put the jar there
and gimme this bucket.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.447
I want the first stuff
to come out of there.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.416
This is the first stuff
right here.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.022
Put that in the hydrometer.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.025
Well, she's floating,
but she's down there.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.194
[tim] what you got?

19:56.229 --> 19:58.462
[howard]
I got 150 on the nose, son.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.298
<i> [tim] was a little bit</i>
<i>  higher proof than I expected.</i>

20:00.300 --> 20:02.500
<i>  So, I'm really happy</i>
<i>  with the results there.</i>

20:02.502 --> 20:05.903
I'm thinking if we can
compound this
and run it a number of times,

20:05.905 --> 20:08.773
I think we can increase it
up to 190 proof,

20:08.775 --> 20:09.974
-so, give me that.
-All right.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.876
Just put that in,
don't spill it.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.145
-No, this is gold right here.
-Yeah.

20:14.147 --> 20:15.980
<i>  We're working with</i>
<i>  150 proof moonshine.</i>

20:15.982 --> 20:17.515
That's highly flammable.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.418
<i>  So, we cut down the risk</i>
<i>  a little bit</i>
<i>  by putting some water in it.</i>

20:21.588 --> 20:23.821
We're gonna put
an open flame
under this thing.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.389
We don't wanna blow
ourselves up.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.958
All right, get the fire going.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.093
[howard] fire is on.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.795
You know, we're making
a high proof moonshine.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.864
You got to keep distilling it
to keep eliminating water

20:33.866 --> 20:36.968
and as you're distilling it,
you're pulling that water out,

20:36.970 --> 20:40.238
and the percentage of ethanol
will keep increasing.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.907
Look at that bubbling
right down there.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.175
Oh, she's right,
she is right.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.743
[tim] she's right there.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.978
Come on here gasohol.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.846
We'll make
the world go round.

20:48.848 --> 20:49.780
-Look, look, look.
-[howard] oh-oh.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.415
There you go, howard.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.984
[howard] I didn't doubt you
for a minute, son.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.418
Let's see what we're
working with.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.155
She's coming up there, howard.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.025
190.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.660
I can't believe
you've done this.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.728
It actually come out
pretty fast

21:03.730 --> 21:05.796
because the system's
already hot.

21:05.798 --> 21:09.000
And the first jar
that we pulled out of it is,
like, 190,

21:09.002 --> 21:10.968
<i>  I mean, you can't get</i>
<i>  no better than that.</i>

21:11.504 --> 21:12.403
All right, let's go.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.106
<i> [howard] to the dirt bike</i>
<i>  and beyond.</i>

21:16.409 --> 21:18.376
[upbeat country music playing]

21:20.613 --> 21:21.979
I'll tell you what, boy.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.881
This scenery never gets
older, does it.

21:23.883 --> 21:24.815
No, it don't.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.751
Right here, this plot...
[indistinct]

21:26.786 --> 21:28.286
you know my man, jeremy

21:28.288 --> 21:31.188
finally got this dangum
wooden barrel stilt built.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.592
That's heavier that any
damn stilt I have ever built.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.093
We ready to get
into the woods,

21:36.095 --> 21:39.397
fire this thing up and get
this thing mashed in.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.798
There's water right
there bubba.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.900
It is like to set us a pump
right down there.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.601
-Pump it right to us.
-Yeah

21:43.603 --> 21:44.735
yeah, we got down pipe,

21:44.737 --> 21:46.971
why won't we just go up high
like gravity do the work,

21:46.973 --> 21:48.406
hopefully we get higher than
what we're standing.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.877
Oh, it's nice, ain't it.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.645
That's so much I'm damn
good looking, son.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.981
Gimme that damn pipe,
let's get up closer.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.549
<i>  You know, this is gonna be</i>
<i>  pretty simple.</i>

21:58.551 --> 21:59.917
We're gonna use
a couple of rows

21:59.919 --> 22:02.420
old black pipe like
the old timers used to.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.921
Get it up as high as we can.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.690
<i>  All we got to do is lay</i>
<i>  that black pipe</i>

22:05.692 --> 22:07.692
<i> and pack a few rocks around it</i>

22:07.694 --> 22:09.760
and it's all downhill
from my brother.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.629
Got good pressure
and everything to it.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.531
Plenty of water going
to the stilt site.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.066
<i>  That's what it takes to make</i>
<i>  good liquor.</i>

22:15.068 --> 22:17.168
Now, we go get set up to heat
up our water

22:17.170 --> 22:18.102
and get mashed in.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.637
You know, this is the site
we're gonna use

22:19.639 --> 22:21.906
<i>  this rocket elbow and</i>
<i>  the wooden barrel for stilt.</i>

22:21.908 --> 22:23.774
I'll tell you what, it's still
kind of like up in the air.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.943
It's like, we think, we've got
a good design.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.012
<i>  If it works, or we're</i>
<i>  thinking it's gonna work,</i>

22:28.014 --> 22:29.747
it's gonna make
some damn good liquor,

22:29.749 --> 22:31.549
<i>  but until we get some</i>
<i>  mash made</i>

22:31.551 --> 22:33.851
and put heat to it,
we really don't know.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.186
Just don't get too damn
excited yet,

22:35.188 --> 22:36.387
until we'll get it mashed in.

22:36.923 --> 22:37.922
-Man I,
-oh.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.957
I ain't gonna kiss you yet.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.025
All right, kiss me though.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.026
I might.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.362
-Kiss my butt maybe.
-[laughs]

22:44.364 --> 22:45.496
<i>  you know,</i>
<i>  this is the first time</i>

22:45.932 --> 22:47.565
<i>  me and jerry's putting all</i>
<i>  this stuff together.</i>

22:47.567 --> 22:49.033
<i>  We're both excited to see how</i>
<i>  this is gonna work,</i>

22:49.035 --> 22:51.068
but I'm kind of scared
and iffy about it.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.303
I don't wanna burn
nothing up.

22:52.839 --> 22:53.804
There we go.

22:53.806 --> 22:54.805
<i>  Heating up 50 gallons water,</i>

22:54.807 --> 22:56.874
it takes a lot of heat
to do this.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.542
We'll get something
to burn man.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.044
About ready to run some.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.246
<i>  Mother nature's provided us</i>
<i>  a lot of wood,</i>

23:02.248 --> 23:03.414
so, we're just gonna use that.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.382
Fire it up son.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.089
-You hear sound changing.
-I do.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.093
I believe we're burning.

23:23.002 --> 23:23.934
Just barely smoking.

23:24.771 --> 23:25.403
I know barely.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.305
What do you think, jerry?

23:28.608 --> 23:29.707
I think it's working,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.675
it's just gonna take a minute
to heat up, you know.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.911
We've got a 40 something
gallons worth of cold water,

23:33.913 --> 23:35.413
it's gonna absorb
a little bit of heat.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.885
<i>  We got the rocket burner</i>
<i>  fired up.</i>

23:40.887 --> 23:42.386
<i>  It's actually, it's working.</i>

23:42.388 --> 23:44.088
It's just not working,

23:44.857 --> 23:46.157
as quick as it should.

23:46.893 --> 23:47.691
What do you think, jerry?

23:47.693 --> 23:49.727
The damn thing should burn.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.762
I'm little stumped,
am little confused, you know,

23:51.764 --> 23:52.997
<i>  the flame we got burning</i>
<i>  is pitiful.</i>

23:52.999 --> 23:54.665
At the rate
it's burning right now,

23:54.667 --> 23:56.333
it's gonna take months
to heat up.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.968
We just can't get enough
fire son.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.638
<i>  This rocket burner, it has</i>
<i>  to use heat for a draft.</i>

24:00.640 --> 24:02.840
Heat is coming up
through our flue.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.608
The cold water is sucking
all the heat out of it.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.509
So, it can't draft properly.

24:05.511 --> 24:08.045
A wanna run liquor jerry.
[bleep]

24:08.047 --> 24:09.947
this is a big deal, you know,
we've got to make some money.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.415
Just a matter of finding out

24:11.417 --> 24:13.017
what's gonna take it
to make it run.

24:23.863 --> 24:24.862
<i> [howard] I got my minibike</i>
<i>  over here.</i>

24:24.864 --> 24:26.897
<i> Let's try some of this ethanol</i>
<i>  in it.</i>

24:26.899 --> 24:28.599
Never thought I'd see the day
moonshine

24:28.601 --> 24:30.734
was going into a dangum
gas tank.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.537
We've created 190 proof
ethanol.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.539
<i>  I wanted to actually start it</i>
<i>  in howard's truck,</i>

24:35.541 --> 24:37.107
but he was kind of like,
I don't wanna do that.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.009
I wanna do a little research
and development.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.811
So, I offered my minibike.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.880
And I think we'll just try
a 100%

24:42.882 --> 24:45.616
clear ethanol in it
and see what happens.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.951
All right, howard, I'm ready.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.352
-You ready?
-I want you to ride.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.421
-You...
-I'm gonna start it.

24:50.423 --> 24:51.956
You want me to be test pilot
on this.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.924
Yeah, I am gonna start it.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.759
Oh, hell tim.

24:55.761 --> 24:56.427
Try one more time.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.096
Oh, we got live action.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.298
-All right.
-Now.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.933
All right, now if she will
just go anywhere.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.435
All right.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.975
Well, that's working somewhat.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.348
He cranked it up while
he was still riding on it,
look at it.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.422
<i> [howard] I am a master</i>
<i>  minibike driver.</i>

25:25.424 --> 25:26.891
I mean I'm throwing fire
at this baby.

25:26.893 --> 25:27.758
She just won't turn on for me.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.159
We got nothing.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.640
I keep an eye on, but
he might roll up on his banks

25:42.642 --> 25:44.174
come put his cornfield
right here.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.844
We've been waiting
all night long

25:46.846 --> 25:48.812
at henry for josh to show up,

25:48.814 --> 25:50.848
<i>  and we ain't seen hide</i>
<i>  nor hair of it.</i>

25:50.850 --> 25:53.984
So, we decided to go out
and look for him.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.421
What do you reckon the odds
are we finding josh.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.090
Well, if he plays it right,

26:00.092 --> 26:02.726
he'll get back and just watch.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.894
He recognizes the truck

26:03.896 --> 26:05.863
then he'll come up to us and

26:05.865 --> 26:07.965
-we can pick him up hopefully.
-Yeah.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.005
<i>  Well, it's not any roads</i>

26:15.007 --> 26:16.707
between here
and that mountain.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.409
He didn't wait for us here.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.843
He'd have to go
over the mountain.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.579
-Hmm.
-He ain't getting
near anything

26:21.581 --> 26:23.213
and I think that we could
possibly pick him up.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.848
The way to the still site
was laid out.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.318
It's not but one way
that he could possibly go.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.419
<i>  And it's an old dirt road</i>

26:28.421 --> 26:31.155
just a few miles from
where we were raided.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.557
So, my plan is to ride up and
down a dirt road a few times.

26:33.559 --> 26:36.393
<i>  If josh just got to cross</i>
<i>  that road somewhere.</i>

26:36.395 --> 26:39.196
I don't know man I'm making
another round or two at it.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.665
<i>  If he didn't come out,</i>
<i>  I don't know what to do.</i>

26:41.667 --> 26:44.768
Henry knows every back road,
every dirt road,

26:44.770 --> 26:48.706
every darn goat path through
the woods around here.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.875
But really, all we can hope
for now

26:51.877 --> 26:53.043
is that we run across him.

26:53.045 --> 26:56.113
This is not looking good,
not looking good at all.

26:57.550 --> 26:58.515
<i>  What do you think , tickle?</i>

26:58.517 --> 27:01.652
I hate giving up on him,
but we've done about

27:01.654 --> 27:03.954
got all that out of this
stretch, we gonna get.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.690
[henry] he got that
natural instinct though.

27:06.692 --> 27:09.526
If anybody can make it through
the mountain then be him.

27:09.528 --> 27:10.928
Maybe he will work his way
to house.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.896
-Hey hey.
-Hey, look, look, look, look.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.898
Look up, look it him.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.001
-Son of a bitch.
-Damn, it.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.035
-There we go.
-There we go

27:18.137 --> 27:21.372
[laughs]

27:21.807 --> 27:22.840
we got him.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.975
Right we gave about
give up on him.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.044
-Give me some water.
-Here, got one,

27:27.546 --> 27:28.145
there you go.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.847
Our last run through here.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.548
Hell yes, I don't mind.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.117
[laughs]

27:36.856 --> 27:39.423
I don't think it's gonna
work old buddy.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.457
What do you mean,
it ain't gonna work.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.825
I'm not getting... It's all
she got.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.762
<i> It didn't go too good, because</i>
<i>  we had straight ethanol.</i>

27:44.764 --> 27:47.364
So, right now, I'm gonna add
a little bit more gas to it.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.400
I'm looking at maybe 20% gas.

27:50.503 --> 27:51.602
<i>  But right now,</i>

27:51.837 --> 27:55.039
we are learning how far can we
stretch a gallon of gas.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.007
All right, let's see.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.411
-All right.
-Ah-ha

28:00.413 --> 28:02.112
I'll be right here,
hold down the fort, tim.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.254
Send it.

28:11.424 --> 28:12.990
Lil' scoop for the old
buddies.

28:13.025 --> 28:13.791
You found it.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.962
I'll be damn
this actually works.

28:19.899 --> 28:20.864
I mean, I started riding
this thing,

28:20.866 --> 28:22.566
I feel like I'm a teenager.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.201
<i>  So, I'm thinking</i>
<i>  now is the time,</i>

28:24.203 --> 28:25.502
<i>  we need to get in</i>
<i>  another engine,</i>

28:25.504 --> 28:27.037
<i>  but another type vehicle,</i>

28:27.039 --> 28:28.739
maybe the tractor. The truck
or something.

28:28.741 --> 28:29.873
Something bigger.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.042
All right, check out
the old shot the right time.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.144
I mean, it probably damn
hit three gs.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.245
Well, let's get to gas can.

28:36.582 --> 28:37.448
Tim,

28:38.684 --> 28:40.017
what are you doing
with the old tractor?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.985
I'm putting some
pep in it chuck.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.154
Me and howard have made

28:44.156 --> 28:45.489
what they call gasohol.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.958
It's 80% ethanol

28:47.960 --> 28:50.828
and 20% gasoline, because
we don't much gasoline.

28:50.830 --> 28:51.962
We'll fire this dude up,

28:51.964 --> 28:52.963
let's see,
I think he's going go.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.431
Do you wanna to try it?

28:54.433 --> 28:57.067
Now tim, this tractor has
been sitting around since
last year

28:57.069 --> 28:58.102
and it ain't moved.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.803
-Let's gonna move.
-I mean if it even start,

28:59.805 --> 29:01.171
it'll be a miracle.

29:01.173 --> 29:01.972
-Get out the way.
-I'm staying.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.040
Just in case we have something

29:03.042 --> 29:04.041
-go boom.
-You never know,

29:04.043 --> 29:05.209
we might blow up.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.848
<i> [howard] look at that.</i>

29:10.850 --> 29:11.315
Started up.

29:12.685 --> 29:13.817
Wow!

29:13.819 --> 29:14.418
-I told you.
-Did you see that.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.890
[tim laughs]

29:19.892 --> 29:21.992
god, that thing came
out of the starting gate

29:21.994 --> 29:24.027
like it was a kentucky derby.

29:24.730 --> 29:25.863
<i>  It was roaring to go.</i>

29:25.865 --> 29:28.065
-Oh, look at.
-Oh oh.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.933
-Look at that, she's running.
-She's going.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.969
-She's going.
-Oh, hey.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.937
Oh, hey. Let it go. Let it go.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.773
Let, let it go look.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.041
<i> [tim] moonshiners were</i>
<i>  very resourceful.</i>

29:38.043 --> 29:40.844
We can turn anything into
something that we can use.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.613
<i>  We got the still,</i>
<i>  we got the grain,</i>

29:42.615 --> 29:44.948
we gotta know how, so when the
gas line backed up.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.751
Hey, you know what we did?
We went and made some gasohol.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.987
Tim, it's like
a brand new tractor.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.022
Just took 50 years
off its life.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.323
-I think I took 50 years
out of you.
-Ha ha.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.159
[laughs]

30:07.940 --> 30:08.872
I don't want that damn
thing,

30:08.874 --> 30:10.007
<i>  I hope this works.</i>

30:10.810 --> 30:11.642
If you've got enough heat

30:11.644 --> 30:13.410
and enough air,
the woods gotta burn.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.078
<i>  We gotta be sure enough</i>
<i>  to figure it out.</i>

30:17.850 --> 30:19.183
-We ain't got all season to
-I understand that.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.384
To see if this gonna work.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.485
It's gonna work.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.421
Higher your flue pipe is
the more you fires don't draw.

30:24.423 --> 30:27.191
<i>  Got an extra five foot thick</i>
<i>  of pipe to add to our</i>

30:27.193 --> 30:28.959
stove pipe, that'd be 10 foot

30:28.961 --> 30:31.028
of flue sticking out
the top of the barrel

30:31.030 --> 30:32.896
<i>  -that's gotta help.</i>
<i>  -Okay.</i>

30:32.898 --> 30:35.699
<i>  If that don't pull,</i>
<i>  then let's go into it.</i>

30:35.701 --> 30:37.234
Let's get her warmed up here.

30:38.737 --> 30:39.970
All I got is some weird draft.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.072
Look how get that burns.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.080
There's no smoke
coming out of that.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.323
It's hot.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.659
It's got to get to
a certain temperature so

31:02.661 --> 31:05.262
it can draw properly,
I know that.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.131
We're gonna have to keep
pushing the wood to it

31:08.133 --> 31:10.901
to get it hot enough to burn,
and it should burn

31:10.903 --> 31:12.870
I mean it's designed
to do well.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.771
So, we got a little bit
of smoke,

31:14.773 --> 31:16.173
come on get bad boy, get it.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.275
<i>  There it goes.</i>

31:18.911 --> 31:19.877
Burning good now.

31:19.879 --> 31:20.878
It's actually working.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.746
I just think it needed
that extra piece of pipe.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.748
My god, she's pulling air now,
ain't it burning.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.450
-Cherry red baby.
-All right.

31:26.452 --> 31:30.053
What I'm doing here is
I'm making an airflow grill.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.723
I'm gonna fashion a little
door to move back and forth

31:32.725 --> 31:33.957
here this brick.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.293
Then we can open up here,

31:36.996 --> 31:39.930
give it a little bit of air
or let it take a lot of air.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.032
Let's pull the next butt
off that man.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.834
We got steam brother.

31:43.836 --> 31:46.637
Hit the stain anytime you have
to mount now sugar baby.

31:46.639 --> 31:48.272
Oh my god, let's get the sugar
in there.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.807
For our first round,
we're gonna do just

31:50.809 --> 31:53.010
a simple traditional
raw whiskey.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.011
-Ready.
-Pour too.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.979
We got some good
finely ground raw.

31:55.981 --> 31:57.581
We're gonna let this steep in

31:57.583 --> 31:58.949
get all the good flavors
out of it.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.984
Gonna be some damn good stuff,
I am telling you that.

32:00.986 --> 32:01.852
We are gonna make
a lot of money of it

32:01.854 --> 32:03.754
-a lot of money.
-Right.

32:03.756 --> 32:04.621
Cuz they're not gonna be
expecting a the clear liquor.

32:04.623 --> 32:05.856
No, they're not

32:05.858 --> 32:09.126
everybody knows rye whiskey
has been
a charred dark liquor.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.894
We're gonna give them
that same product,

32:10.896 --> 32:12.529
<i>  except it's gonna be clear.</i>

32:12.531 --> 32:14.598
Like good charred,
rye taste to it.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.400
Who in the hell would ever
thought about aging

32:16.402 --> 32:18.368
your damn liquor before
you've ever run it.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.136
I'll run it.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.139
May made it,
but we did, [laughs]

32:22.908 --> 32:23.874
all right done.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.342
I think everybody's gonna
love it.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.744
So, what's happening,
is a sugar melted.

32:27.746 --> 32:30.414
And now our rye is just kind
of steeping this hot waters.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.548
So, wooden barrel will keep it
insulated.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.417
So it's got longer to steep.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.786
So, we're gonna let it cool
and we'll pitch
our yeast to it

32:35.788 --> 32:38.255
and it'll sit anywhere from
8 to 12 days.

32:38.257 --> 32:39.089
We're got her done buddy.

32:39.091 --> 32:39.690
Yes sir.

32:39.692 --> 32:40.824
<i>  Get out of here.</i>

32:40.826 --> 32:44.328
I can't wait to get my snort
to that good rye whiskey.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.106
Mash, good found a guinea pig
on my own terse.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.241
Let's just hope guinea
ain't run out of nowhere.

32:59.979 --> 33:00.877
Look behind you.

33:00.879 --> 33:01.645
Look, what we got.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.980
Good to see you brother.

33:02.982 --> 33:07.117
Oh, man, I never been so happy
to see you boys
in all my life.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.786
The fact that I got away
was a freaking miracle.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.021
<i>  These boys raided us</i>

33:11.023 --> 33:13.857
and I never even saw come
until it was too late.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.459
All I know was they come in

33:15.461 --> 33:16.994
ran in other direction,

33:16.996 --> 33:19.629
got up the woods, pretty good
ways away from them.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.898
Kinda started circling
back around.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.668
A little while after dark,
when it got some pitch black,

33:24.670 --> 33:26.737
I couldn't see where
I was going anymore

33:26.739 --> 33:28.905
just bedded down,
I just kinda waited.

33:28.907 --> 33:31.641
Once it lightened up,
I got to that road bend.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.677
I knew that if I hunker down
at that road,

33:33.679 --> 33:35.679
if you guys weren't in jail
at some point

33:35.681 --> 33:36.780
y'all be driving
through there.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.615
That's good move, good move.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.517
What a miracle, I saw
y'all when I did

33:40.519 --> 33:41.618
if you hadn't to came
when you did,

33:41.620 --> 33:43.820
you'd had a piece of josh
jerky laying out there

33:43.822 --> 33:46.089
because I was about to dry
it blow away.

33:46.825 --> 33:47.891
Where the heck is brian at?

33:47.893 --> 33:49.292
Man, brian's gone.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.995
He took off last night
heading home.

33:51.997 --> 33:52.796
Well, I think

33:52.798 --> 33:54.564
he's got a good idea
about going home.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.900
I think I need to go home
for a little while.

33:56.902 --> 33:58.902
You know, we don't have the
fruits to mash or stills in,

33:58.904 --> 34:01.405
make that brandy
we're goanna make.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.074
I have to go back home
to get more fruit anyway.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.943
Maybe I'll load up two stilts,
me go back home set up

34:06.945 --> 34:08.912
a still site lay low
for a month or so.

34:08.914 --> 34:10.414
We were thinking same thing,

34:10.416 --> 34:11.648
you know, when you get hurdles
like this,

34:11.650 --> 34:12.616
we'll use the downsides.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.818
Meant taking kids
to my last night.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.420
Maybe in a month or two,
we come back,

34:16.422 --> 34:17.821
like roll with it again.

34:17.823 --> 34:18.989
Still throw everything
in one pot,

34:18.991 --> 34:20.390
or what are we gonna do?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.025
We're all still are partners
here.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.560
You know,
I don't like splitting up

34:23.562 --> 34:25.095
the team we got here.

34:25.097 --> 34:28.832
But we got to keep all our
moonshiners safe

34:28.867 --> 34:29.900
and making liquor.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.868
And this looks like
our best option.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.603
As soon as he get down,
get them loaded.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.039
-You ready to roll?
-Ready to get your stuff
from down the road?

34:36.041 --> 34:38.408
We really don't know
who raided our still site?

34:39.411 --> 34:40.477
If that was the law,

34:40.846 --> 34:42.712
they probably already be here
arresting us by now.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.981
So, it could have been
a rival shiner.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.983
Somebody just really
don't want us around here.

34:46.985 --> 34:49.252
But one thing is for sure,

34:49.254 --> 34:50.687
we can just tuck our tails
and run.

34:50.689 --> 34:51.855
We're gonna be cautious

34:51.857 --> 34:54.091
and we're gonna move forward
making moonshine,

34:54.093 --> 34:55.625
because whether they want us
here or not,

34:55.627 --> 34:57.027
we're here to stay.

34:57.029 --> 34:59.396
<i>  We all made it back</i>
<i>  and that's all that matters.</i>

35:04.903 --> 35:07.637
You just wait a couple of days
you would wanna go somewhere.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.872
It won't be long,
you're goanna get tired of me.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.941
I ain't got tired of you
12 years yet,

35:10.943 --> 35:13.110
so I don't know, but it's
gonna to happen, old buddy.

35:13.112 --> 35:13.944
You have been with me
12 years.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.645
Twelve years.

35:15.647 --> 35:16.947
What you got, a calendar,
you marking it up.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.148
Yeah, I do. Somebody's got to.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.850
I keep up our
anniversary dates.

35:19.852 --> 35:21.151
We have anniversary date?

35:21.153 --> 35:22.419
-Yes, we do.
-We do?

35:22.955 --> 35:23.854
Oh my god.

35:23.856 --> 35:24.354
October

35:24.890 --> 35:25.922
2009.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.058
Good idea,
I did not know that.

35:28.060 --> 35:29.659
I've been waiting on my gift
every year,

35:29.661 --> 35:30.560
ain't seen nothing yet.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.130
<i>  I didn't know</i>
<i>  we had an anniversary.</i>

35:36.935 --> 35:38.768
Rye whiskey, rye whisky,

35:38.770 --> 35:41.872
please don't whip me down.

35:41.874 --> 35:43.907
Today, we got our mash
we're hoping it's ready to go

35:43.909 --> 35:46.276
because it's gonna be
the first day on our new stilt

35:46.278 --> 35:47.577
and I am super excited.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.412
Let's check out bro.

35:49.414 --> 35:52.382
The whole concept is,
to mash inside this barrel

35:52.417 --> 35:54.985
to create the flavor
that charred wood barrel

35:54.987 --> 35:58.855
and get it into our mash
before we ever distill it off.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.223
This was damn good cap
on it on.

36:00.792 --> 36:01.958
Oh my god.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.760
All you can taste this rye

36:03.762 --> 36:05.028
in that white oak barrel.

36:05.831 --> 36:06.763
-Good I ain't it.
-Wow.

36:06.765 --> 36:07.764
We're are in business.

36:07.766 --> 36:08.632
<i>  We're gonna be</i>
<i>  in big business.</i>

36:08.634 --> 36:10.000
That's absolutely amazing.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.035
I mean it's just like you were
to pop the cork

36:12.037 --> 36:13.603
on good aged whiskey.

36:13.605 --> 36:14.371
That's pretty done.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.705
Couldn't ask
for nothing better.

36:15.707 --> 36:16.973
I knew when we heated it up
real hot,

36:16.975 --> 36:19.042
like it had to color that

36:19.044 --> 36:20.844
with heating this barrel up

36:20.846 --> 36:23.146
and letting it sit
and ferment like this,

36:23.148 --> 36:24.147
I knew that those colors

36:24.149 --> 36:26.883
and that taste was gonna come
through that wood.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.818
<i>  Generally, when you mash it</i>
<i>  in a plastic barrel,</i>

36:28.820 --> 36:31.087
you're gonna have
a milky looking color mash.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.924
You get a good
coffee top color,

36:33.926 --> 36:36.893
you know, that barrel is doing
its job on aging that mash.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.328
We can get this flavor

36:38.864 --> 36:40.597
through the end of that worm,

36:40.599 --> 36:42.732
we're gonna have
some of the best charred

36:42.734 --> 36:44.968
unaged liquor
a man can ever drink.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.737
Let's fire this baby up boy.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.873
We have made
one hell of a mash

36:49.875 --> 36:51.808
and if we get run off
the other end,

36:51.810 --> 36:53.009
it's gonna be even better.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.211
We'll find out now
if it's gonna work.

36:54.213 --> 36:54.878
More above.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.946
Tell you what, I know nobody's

36:55.948 --> 36:58.682
ever ran on a wooden barrel
before but, hey.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.951
There's a first damn time
for everything.

37:00.953 --> 37:02.018
How's she looking back there?

37:02.020 --> 37:02.953
It's burning baby.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.421
Long here from here burn.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.860
Hot damn hot
that wood is already.

37:10.862 --> 37:11.861
Just relax and open.

37:11.863 --> 37:12.929
And all over good flavor.

37:12.931 --> 37:13.430
-Goodies.
-From another.

37:13.699 --> 37:14.431
Yep boy.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.398
This thing is heating up,

37:15.400 --> 37:16.933
it's working like a charm
so far.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.702
It's just a little while

37:18.704 --> 37:20.003
get to put our lips
around this stuff

37:20.005 --> 37:21.671
and see what it's all about.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.906
Jerry, we got liquor brother.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.841
Hell, yeah, it's some time,
man.

37:24.843 --> 37:25.742
-Look at that.
-Look at that.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.776
There she comes.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.745
-Rye whiskey, son.
-Oh yeah.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.780
Let me put my cutting rod
in it.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.882
I tell you what man
I am tickled to death

37:32.884 --> 37:34.551
to see these first few drops
coming out.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.919
It's the highest, baby

37:35.921 --> 37:37.921
<i> we're catching the first drops</i>
<i>  of alcohol</i>

37:37.923 --> 37:40.023
<i>  from a damn wooden barrel</i>

37:40.025 --> 37:42.192
and me and jerry
just two dudes doing it.

37:42.194 --> 37:43.293
-Are you ready.
-Ready.

37:43.328 --> 37:44.327
Don't waste it.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.430
Well, I don't think so
it would take me whole.

37:55.407 --> 37:56.940
I'm gonna tell you
right down man

37:56.942 --> 37:58.208
'cause a blind man,
couldn't tell that

37:58.210 --> 38:00.076
that no good aged
charred damn liquor.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.211
Taste that.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.247
I think that's nice.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.549
Let us sail along it brother.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.785
That is, I mean clears a bail.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.854
And it tastes like it's got
that nose,

38:10.856 --> 38:12.022
you can taste the rye.

38:12.024 --> 38:12.756
<i>  It's perfect.</i>

38:12.758 --> 38:13.990
This liquor is like

38:13.992 --> 38:17.093
none other than me and jerry
has ever made.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.595
<i>  The charred flavor is there.</i>

38:18.597 --> 38:20.063
That's what we're looking for.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.699
The fact that it being clear
is gonna blow people's mind.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.833
I got my nose a little

38:23.835 --> 38:26.036
the notes are there,
the flavors there,

38:26.038 --> 38:27.103
<i>  it's absolutely amazing</i>

38:27.139 --> 38:30.006
and it's clear, I mean,
what more could you ask for?

38:30.008 --> 38:31.975
If somebody don't like that,
they don't like whiskey.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.810
Yeah, you know, what man

38:33.812 --> 38:35.111
this whole thing
was jerry's idea.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.013
You know building a still out
with damn wooden barrel.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.248
Oh, come on man.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.516
<i>  One more down jerry.</i>

38:39.518 --> 38:40.717
<i>  But I stood behind him,</i>

38:40.719 --> 38:42.852
feels really good
to accomplish this together.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.087
We got seven and a half
gallons of

38:44.089 --> 38:46.523
good rye, aged,
clear damn liquor.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.791
Can't beat it son.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.059
Let's just get these boxes
and rock our asses

38:49.061 --> 38:50.026
on out of here.

38:50.028 --> 38:50.827
People's going nuts over

38:50.829 --> 38:52.696
a barrel aged whiskey
right now.

38:52.698 --> 38:53.963
That's what they want to pull
off the shelves.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.199
That's what they want to buy
under the table.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.869
<i>  By infusing all these charred</i>
<i>  notes in a clear liquor,</i>

38:59.871 --> 39:01.871
me and jerry have
something new,

39:01.873 --> 39:03.773
something different,
something unique.

39:03.775 --> 39:06.443
Something that the customer
really wants.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.712
<i>  And I know a hell of a lot of</i>
<i>  customers are gonna like it.</i>

39:08.714 --> 39:10.347
-That's what's important.
-Yeah boy.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.465
-Man this sucks.
-Yes, it does.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.532
<i> [henry] but you know,</i>

39:29.534 --> 39:31.634
<i>  I think it's better</i>
<i>  to stay out of jail.</i>

39:31.636 --> 39:33.002
That's a good thing
that we wanted to run

39:33.004 --> 39:36.406
this green lizard
at a different stilt site.

39:36.408 --> 39:37.874
<i>  Because our big stilt site</i>

39:37.876 --> 39:39.976
did not get compromised.

39:39.978 --> 39:40.777
We will try to drag him out.

39:40.812 --> 39:41.778
I reckon.

39:42.114 --> 39:42.979
-Just kinda heavy.
-That's a whole lot to do.

39:42.981 --> 39:43.847
What to do is.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.216
We don't have enough fruit
to fill up

39:46.218 --> 39:50.153
all of these pots to justify
everybody being here running.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.055
[grunts]

39:52.057 --> 39:52.522
[henry] that's good.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.557
All right, one more.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.327
There's a lot of things that
goes into being a moonshiner.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.398
<i>  There's a lot of planning,</i>
<i>  there's a lot of hard work,</i>

40:01.400 --> 40:02.766
a lot of times that hard work,

40:02.768 --> 40:04.667
just goes right down
the drain.

40:04.669 --> 40:08.204
You just got to adapt
to the situation.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.873
And as long as you
don't get locked up

40:09.875 --> 40:12.842
and put in jail,
it's still a success.

40:12.844 --> 40:13.376
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.013
All right.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.782
Well, I know I'm taking
these two stilts,

40:18.784 --> 40:20.850
but what are we gonna to do
with the rest of the stills.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.485
So, we gonna to move
on to another location.

40:22.487 --> 40:23.853
Well, situation where it is,

40:23.855 --> 40:25.722
what do you think about
taking two more out

40:25.724 --> 40:27.023
and leave us four
me, tickle and kenny.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.925
We'll have two of them left,

40:28.927 --> 40:29.626
we plan on getting
somebody else,

40:29.628 --> 40:30.760
maybe run those two.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.996
So, we'll still have the same
operation going.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.631
Who's gonna get
the other two stilts?

40:34.633 --> 40:35.999
We got a couple guys
we're talking to.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.867
We'll have to furnish
all the materials,

40:37.869 --> 40:40.937
<i>  sugar, yeast, jugs,</i>

40:40.939 --> 40:42.539
everything it takes
to set these guys up.

40:42.541 --> 40:43.573
What profits is made.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.341
<i>  They'll get a third,</i>
<i>  we'll get two thirds.</i>

40:45.343 --> 40:46.543
But the main thing is

40:46.545 --> 40:48.778
that we're going to be having
all this liquor coming from

40:48.780 --> 40:50.613
coming from the other two
to take care of our customers.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.682
If we don't,
they'll go somewhere else.

40:52.684 --> 40:54.751
So, everything we're doing
is still going to be

40:54.753 --> 40:55.752
all for one and one for all.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.654
We're still in operation.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.622
We're just going in separate
directions for a little while.

40:59.624 --> 41:00.690
-For a little while.
-Yeah.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.058
-For a little while.
-We want to come back.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.393
All right, well,
I'm down with it.

41:03.395 --> 41:04.327
Let's roll with this.

41:06.698 --> 41:07.931
I'm gonna take my stilts

41:07.933 --> 41:10.400
and I'm gonna go
to north carolina set them up.

41:10.402 --> 41:11.935
And then when I come back,

41:11.937 --> 41:13.970
I'll come back with fruit
those stills

41:13.972 --> 41:15.438
and we'll still have
our operation.

41:16.408 --> 41:18.074
Man glad to have these
on the trailer,

41:18.076 --> 41:20.009
but I'm really sad to be
taking them out of here.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.411
But you know, josh, I got

41:21.413 --> 41:22.745
to look at it like this
though.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.747
We live in to shine
another day,

41:24.749 --> 41:27.350
and by breaking this setup
right here,

41:27.352 --> 41:29.252
we're gonna keep on making
more liquor.
