00:37.167 --> 00:39.613
Dear Lord...

00:39.633 --> 00:42.409
we pray that we may
win this game today.

00:42.433 --> 00:46.142
We ask that you give us
the strength and the courage...

00:46.167 --> 00:50.081
to win our second straight
state championship.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.171
We ask, Lord, that...

00:52.200 --> 00:54.737
nobody on our side
is seriously injured.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.705
We know in our hearts, Lord...

01:00.733 --> 01:02.735
that we are the best team.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.381
We ask that you allow us
to win this game.

01:13.567 --> 01:16.377
The Lord wants you to put
your foot on their balls...

01:16.400 --> 01:18.073
and believe in it...

01:18.100 --> 01:21.411
because that's
what wins football games.

01:21.433 --> 01:25.279
Not jumping offsides like
a bunch of wimps and faggots.

01:27.233 --> 01:29.804
All right, lift your heads.
Prayer's over. I talked to God.

01:29.833 --> 01:34.213
I'm through talking to God.
Now I'm talking to you.

01:34.233 --> 01:36.577
You're going to be out there
in front of your families...

01:36.600 --> 01:38.170
your student body.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.271
Every girl you ever had
a hard-on for...

01:40.300 --> 01:42.473
is gonna be out there today,
but you will not be going...

01:42.500 --> 01:44.036
to no sock hop tonight, boys.

01:44.067 --> 01:46.843
You will not get no honey
on your stinger tonight...

01:46.867 --> 01:50.474
if you don't go out there
and bust your ass.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.538
Because this is it.

01:53.567 --> 01:55.376
This is the big one.

01:57.967 --> 01:59.605
I want you to taste it.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.773
I want you to smell it, son.

02:07.067 --> 02:08.410
There's winners...

02:08.433 --> 02:10.435
and there's nothing else.

02:10.467 --> 02:13.380
I don't give a shit what
those pinkos over in Russia say.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.540
You want to be a loser,
you go live in Russia.

02:16.567 --> 02:20.344
I'm not a loser. I'm a winner.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.778
I'm an American.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.473
Who wants to be John Wayne?

02:23.500 --> 02:27.107
Who wants to go out there
and grab a root and hang on?

02:27.133 --> 02:28.942
Who wants to get a mean-on?

02:28.967 --> 02:30.878
Get a mean-on, son.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.938
Let me see
you get a mean-on, son!

02:33.967 --> 02:36.811
Now, who wants it?
I want to know! Who wants this?

02:36.833 --> 02:37.971
Who wants to get
a mean-on right now?

02:39.133 --> 02:41.511
-Who wants it?
-I want it!

03:13.033 --> 03:14.376
Good job, man!

03:14.400 --> 03:19.110
The pride of Ashcroft High,
Johnny Walker!

03:19.133 --> 03:20.476
Hut!

03:26.900 --> 03:28.937
By God,
we're playing football now!

03:28.967 --> 03:29.945
Yes, sir!

03:29.967 --> 03:32.174
Coach? It's the last game
of the season.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.737
Do you think I could maybe
get in for a couple of minutes?

03:34.767 --> 03:38.112
-You want to play?
-Yes. Please.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.476
No, you don't.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.346
Hut! Hut!

03:58.233 --> 04:01.373
Walker's fortieth T.D. pass
this season!

04:01.400 --> 04:03.937
A new state record!

04:03.967 --> 04:07.210
Wide! Wide set!

04:16.533 --> 04:19.207
Gash, give him
the punt sign, will ya?

04:25.033 --> 04:27.445
Walker! Kick the ball! Kick it!

04:27.467 --> 04:28.468
Hut!

04:41.900 --> 04:43.811
Another record for Walker!

04:43.833 --> 04:45.369
-Did you see that?
-Look at that!

04:45.400 --> 04:47.710
Five-second hang time?

04:54.067 --> 04:55.068
Pardon you.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.213
With that completion
to Michael Bentley...

05:01.233 --> 05:04.476
Walker has just set
a national high school record!

05:04.500 --> 05:08.778
1:35, Gibson's out of his car
and into the stadium.

05:11.467 --> 05:14.937
Excuse me. Shove over,
would you, please? Thanks.

05:14.967 --> 05:17.607
Coach...

05:17.633 --> 05:19.704
that offer still stands.

05:19.733 --> 05:21.610
My answer's still no.

05:21.633 --> 05:23.613
You wait for us
for the signals!

05:23.633 --> 05:25.544
We're calling
the plays here, Walker!

05:25.567 --> 05:28.776
I think the score is 52-0.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.780
What can we do
to get Gash in the game?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.178
I got it.
Let's lose five. Break!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.474
Break!

05:36.467 --> 05:38.174
Push it in!
I want another score!

05:38.200 --> 05:40.305
Let's go! Let's go!

05:43.367 --> 05:45.347
Hut! Hut!

05:45.367 --> 05:47.608
I'm going down.
Oh, it's the leg. I'm down.

05:48.633 --> 05:50.943
What's he doing?
What's Walker doing?

05:50.967 --> 05:53.607
I think I broke my dick!

05:54.900 --> 05:57.141
Oh, no, not his George.

05:57.167 --> 05:59.647
Walker's out.
Gash! Gash! Get me Gash!

05:59.667 --> 06:00.737
Right here. What's up?

06:00.767 --> 06:02.804
Get in the game, Gash!
Put it in the end zone.

06:02.833 --> 06:03.971
My first time!

06:04.000 --> 06:06.139
-What's the matter, son?
-I broke my dick, Coach.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.078
Rub some dirt on it
and get back in there.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.511
It's broken, I'm telling you.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.479
You go left.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.036
You go right. I'll run.

06:13.067 --> 06:14.068
Break!

06:17.800 --> 06:18.801
Hut!

06:22.467 --> 06:25.346
Oh, Gash! Gash!

06:25.367 --> 06:27.779
Throw your navel
in the ground, will ya?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.144
-Hey, Juicy.
-Hey, Johnny.

06:30.167 --> 06:31.942
Would you mind taking off
your underpants real quick...

06:31.967 --> 06:33.241
and go stand over there?

06:33.267 --> 06:35.611
-Sure. Anything for you.
-Thank you.

06:37.867 --> 06:41.906
2:35, cheerleader taking
her yellow panties off.

06:41.933 --> 06:43.503
Thank you. Over and out.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.770
Hey, guys, Juicy Dorfman
isn't wearing any underpants.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.480
SQ?

06:55.500 --> 06:58.481
Left, 46, on the first sound.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.478
Ready?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.478
Break!

07:00.500 --> 07:01.501
Break!

07:07.200 --> 07:08.941
Oh, I see.

07:08.967 --> 07:10.640
That girl's not wearing
any underwear.

07:10.667 --> 07:11.839
What?

07:11.867 --> 07:13.847
-Which one?
-Hey, check it out!

07:13.867 --> 07:15.471
Hut!

07:20.700 --> 07:22.907
<i>Hob; mob!‘-!</i>

07:22.933 --> 07:24.276
Oh, wrong.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.108
I see the hole!
I see the hole!

07:33.133 --> 07:35.010
I see--yeah!

07:45.200 --> 07:47.703
Ashcroft High has just won...

07:47.733 --> 07:51.203
their second consecutive
state football championship!

07:51.233 --> 07:54.043
Congratulations
to coach Wayne Hisler...

07:54.067 --> 07:57.640
and especially to everyone's
high school all-American...

07:57.667 --> 07:59.669
Johnny Walker!

08:22.967 --> 08:24.241
Hello?

08:24.267 --> 08:26.907
Hey, Johnny.
Glad I could get to you.

08:26.933 --> 08:28.276
<i>This is Howard Case“.</i>

08:28.300 --> 08:31.042
You were just tremendous
out there today.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.808
I've never seen
a better performance...

08:33.832 --> 08:35.073
at the high school level.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.604
You should go
to an Ivy League school...

08:38.633 --> 08:42.740
by the name of Yale University,
in my opinion, young man.

08:42.767 --> 08:45.008
Have you thought
about such a thing?

08:45.033 --> 08:47.013
ls this really you, Howard?
Howard?

08:47.033 --> 08:50.139
-Who is this?
-This is Howard Cosell.

08:50.167 --> 08:53.148
Does anybody in America
like you? Huh?

08:56.500 --> 08:59.572
Coach, I'm sorry.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.705
My boys, my boys, all right.

09:01.733 --> 09:03.371
That's worth a victory, huh?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.880
That's worth a victory.

09:09.033 --> 09:10.774
Johnny, listen to me, man.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.905
Sign with me,
I will make you a star.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.276
Ignore all these
other guys, man.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.109
They're a bunch
of athletic pimps.

09:16.133 --> 09:18.340
Trust me--athletic pimps.
Look at the way they dress.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.278
Write your own ticket!
I'll give you anything you want.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.371
Spring break, huh? Puerto Rico!

09:22.400 --> 09:24.744
Just tell me what you want,
and I'll get you two of them.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.303
What do you like?
You like girls?

09:26.333 --> 09:29.473
-I like your head.
-You got it! What else?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.207
Ice cream? Cultural pursuits?

09:31.233 --> 09:35.306
Johnny, I can offer you
TV coverage.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.939
I can offer you TV
every single Saturday.

09:37.967 --> 09:39.947
You don't need him.

09:39.967 --> 09:42.140
I got what you want.
I got what you need.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.875
We'll keep running
that style of offense, boy.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.902
You're gonna start right away!
Right away, you hear?

09:46.933 --> 09:48.879
That's what you want to do--
play football, right, boy?

09:58.367 --> 10:01.780
Smurfs. Smurfs. Smurf patrol.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.303
Hi. Thank you.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.040
Watch my feet. Watch the toes.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.637
OK. Don't I know your mom?

10:07.667 --> 10:09.476
What's it like being king
of the 12-year-olds?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.502
Georgia! What?

10:11.533 --> 10:12.910
Say that again?

10:12.933 --> 10:15.573
What's it like being king
of the 12-year-olds?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.977
Let me tell you something.
These girls are gonna be...

10:17.000 --> 10:18.775
beautiful grown women
in about two minutes.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.178
-You shouldn't really say that.
-Freeze!

10:21.200 --> 10:23.373
Move away from my daughter,
Walker!

10:23.400 --> 10:24.879
Don't tell me
he's still pissed off...

10:24.900 --> 10:26.777
'cause I brought you home
a day late?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.871
Don't tell me that.
ls that what happened?

10:28.900 --> 10:31.346
No.

10:31.367 --> 10:32.345
Johnny..

10:32.367 --> 10:33.846
What? What was it?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.505
It was the hickeys.

10:35.533 --> 10:37.479
You can't really
cover those up at all.

10:39.567 --> 10:41.877
-What?
-Let's give him one.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.580
Get your mouth off her, Walker!

10:48.600 --> 10:50.341
Let's go, Georgia!

10:50.367 --> 10:51.368
"Ow!

10:55.733 --> 10:57.644
I'll see you later.

10:57.667 --> 10:58.645
Very good.

10:58.667 --> 10:59.941
Do you love me?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.280
Thank you.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.109
I can't say anything
but thank you.

11:07.533 --> 11:10.412
-Over here, boy!
-Johnny!

11:10.433 --> 11:12.435
You could be going
to the Super Bowl!

11:16.667 --> 11:18.271
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.713
I'm sorry. I can't talk now.
I have to go. Watch the jacket.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.110
We'll talk later. OK.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.669
Wrong!

11:24.700 --> 11:27.476
Less with the lies,
more with the broads!

11:30.500 --> 11:31.501
Back off!

11:31.533 --> 11:32.978
Bye now!

11:33.000 --> 11:35.446
Thank you.
Thanks a lot, recruiters!

11:35.467 --> 11:37.378
You think those recruiters
would all want you as much...

11:37.400 --> 11:40.779
if they knew you were
afraid of the dark?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.177
I'm not afraid of the dark.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.043
It's OK. I'm not gonna
spill the beans...

11:44.067 --> 11:45.671
that you sleep
with a night-light.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.543
I don't need a night-light.

11:48.567 --> 11:52.481
Come on. Yes, you do. It's OK.
You're a punk. Accept it.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.741
All right, I accept it.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.713
So what?!

11:56.733 --> 11:57.973
SQ?

11:59.900 --> 12:01.004
OK, hit me again.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.335
Right here.

12:08.233 --> 12:10.110
I feel good now.

12:10.133 --> 12:13.376
Leo, it's time you and me
moved on to big-time, pal.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.243
-The big-time scholarships...
-UCC.

12:15.267 --> 12:19.079
-Big-time contacts, big deals.
-UCC is the place for you.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.080
Hey, did I ever tell you
about Coach Hisler's wife?

12:21.100 --> 12:24.047
-No. UCC.
-She has a set of chihuahuas...

12:24.233 --> 12:27.214
There's someone sneakin‘

12:27.233 --> 12:30.237
Round the corner

12:30.267 --> 12:32.713
Could that someone

12:32.733 --> 12:35.976
Be Mack the Knife?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.742
There's a tugboat

12:38.767 --> 12:41.407
Down by the river,
don't you know?

12:41.433 --> 12:44.710
Well, the cement there

12:44.733 --> 12:47.543
Just a-drooping on down

12:47.567 --> 12:49.240
You're getting
really good, Wayne.

12:49.267 --> 12:51.440
I just love your singing.

12:51.467 --> 12:52.639
Thank you, baby.

12:52.667 --> 12:55.204
You know, I was reading
at the market today...

12:55.233 --> 12:57.679
that we all come
from another world...

12:57.700 --> 13:01.273
and we choose in that world who
we want to be in this world...

13:01.300 --> 13:05.771
and we're all connected
by a common cosmic thread.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.336
That's right, honey.
That's true.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.710
What time you going to work?

13:08.733 --> 13:11.339
After I make dinner for you
and clean up.

13:11.367 --> 13:15.782
Do you realize that we're living
nine lives simultaneously?

13:15.800 --> 13:16.972
Of course.

13:18.833 --> 13:20.608
-Listen, sweetcake?
-Yes?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.635
On your way back from work,
would you pick up...

13:22.667 --> 13:24.112
my yellow suit
from the cleaners?

13:24.133 --> 13:27.273
OK. No problem.
It's near that bakery...

13:27.300 --> 13:31.749
that bakes that black
mundle bread you love so much.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.641
Hello. Coach Hisler's house?

13:44.667 --> 13:46.146
ls he in?

13:46.167 --> 13:47.908
I think so.

13:47.933 --> 13:49.003
May l?

13:49.033 --> 13:52.537
Oh, sure. Just follow
the sound of the music.

13:52.567 --> 13:53.841
Thank you.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.175
Whoo, look out

13:55.200 --> 13:56.611
Oh, Miss Lottie Lenya

13:56.633 --> 14:01.173
And old Lucy Brown

14:01.200 --> 14:05.444
Chancellor, how are you?
Good to see you again, sir.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.276
How about that game today, huh?

14:07.300 --> 14:09.211
Nice. Walker was everything
you said he was.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.234
Yes.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.508
What do I do to get him
to go to Piermont?

14:12.533 --> 14:14.706
I just want you to sit down
and relax. Enjoy my home.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.940
You're going to have dinner
with us, aren't you?

14:16.967 --> 14:21.507
I don't think we have enough
salmon patties, Wayne.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.342
What the hey?

14:23.367 --> 14:26.246
Break out
the fish sticks, honey.

14:26.267 --> 14:27.371
<i>Oh, OK.</i>

14:27.400 --> 14:31.143
Darling. Some of that
sparkling fruit wine.

14:32.933 --> 14:35.277
Have a seat, please,
Chancellor.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.507
Look, Coach, I didn't get
to become president...

14:37.533 --> 14:40.446
of Piermont University
by mincing words.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.572
My backers
are getting impatient.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.477
They want success this year.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.538
They want to win.
I want Walker.

14:47.567 --> 14:50.207
I'm the key to Walker,
obviously.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.837
Obviously you are.

14:51.867 --> 14:55.280
What is it you want?
Name your price.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.747
I want to be the new head coach
at Piermont University.

14:58.767 --> 14:59.768
ls that all?

14:59.800 --> 15:01.802
No. I want a five-year
no-cut contract...

15:01.833 --> 15:03.210
weekly television show...

15:03.233 --> 15:05.941
membership in the country club,
et cetera. All the usual perks.

15:05.967 --> 15:09.380
The main thing is that Walker
is going to go...

15:09.400 --> 15:12.540
where I tell him to go,
or he's not going anywhere.

15:12.567 --> 15:13.841
That's a fact.

15:13.867 --> 15:16.609
You can guarantee that?

15:16.633 --> 15:18.476
The kid loves me.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.741
You know, it's--.

15:20.767 --> 15:23.043
I'm like a father to him.
Really.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.707
Hisler's such an asshole.

15:27.100 --> 15:32.049
Johnny, I've been having all
these twisted visions lately.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.944
So lay one on me.

15:33.967 --> 15:37.073
Well, I was thinking
about developing...

15:37.100 --> 15:39.808
a deep personal relationship
with a psychiatrist.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.540
You know, very tight.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.569
And then one day, just while
he's complimenting me...

15:43.600 --> 15:45.637
on all the headway
progress I'm making...

15:45.667 --> 15:48.443
in the area of my obsessive
fear of torque wrenches...

15:48.467 --> 15:52.540
just cut him off mid-sentence
and say, "Hey, oops!

15:52.567 --> 15:56.105
"Why am I angry at you today?"
He gets all Germanic on me...

15:56.133 --> 15:58.670
and goes, "Well,
I think that it stems--"

15:58.700 --> 16:01.408
It stems from nothing.
That's a trick question.

16:01.433 --> 16:04.277
I take his Ph.D. off the wall
and beat him...

16:04.300 --> 16:06.541
about the head and shoulders
with it for about an hour...

16:06.567 --> 16:08.979
and then I whisper
softly in his ear...

16:09.000 --> 16:12.379
"I'd like to pay for my next
twenty visits in advance."

16:29.133 --> 16:31.807
Johnny, be all you can be.

16:31.833 --> 16:35.144
-For $81.50 a month after taxes?
-Exactly.

16:35.167 --> 16:36.908
No, I don't think so.
Thank you, though.

16:36.933 --> 16:39.106
-Notre Dame, my son.
-Father, how you doing?

16:39.133 --> 16:40.874
Aren't you gonna be late
for a mass or something?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.277
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.644
Alabama is football.
Alabama's where you should be!

16:44.667 --> 16:46.669
Penn State is always
in the top ten.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.407
We kicked Alabama's butt
last year.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.845
That was one game.
It's freezing in Penn State.

16:50.867 --> 16:52.005
It's a normal climate.

16:52.033 --> 16:54.274
Normal? Normal if you're
a seal or an eskimo.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.007
It's good to see
the seasons change!

16:56.033 --> 16:58.138
It's good to see
the seasons change!

17:02.067 --> 17:03.512
Leo, Leo.

17:03.533 --> 17:06.480
My school has a buddy system.
If Johnny goes there...

17:06.500 --> 17:08.741
all of his buddies get
to go there, too, first class.

17:08.767 --> 17:10.769
Boy buddies, girl buddies,
everybody.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.404
I'm ready for college...

17:12.433 --> 17:13.776
and corruption.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.244
My school doesn't do that, Leo.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.406
It just exists
in your imagination.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.344
Well, I have
a grand imagination.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.811
How about ten grand?

17:29.867 --> 17:31.175
Leo, more chicken?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.441
I'll just get the rest
to go, please.

17:33.467 --> 17:34.537
Right.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.979
Anything, Johnny, anything!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.377
I love you!

17:38.400 --> 17:40.107
Let's set a time!

17:40.133 --> 17:42.773
I'm free tonight!

17:44.900 --> 17:47.676
I can't believe the bald guy
is still here.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.145
It's crazy out there.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.910
Well, it's crazy in here, too,
but I like it.

17:52.933 --> 17:55.539
My lures are selling
like hotcakes.

17:55.567 --> 17:58.070
They especially like
my walleyed gibbler.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.842
- This is exciting.
-It's original, huh?

18:01.067 --> 18:03.104
Oh, honey, I'm proud of you.
I really am.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.079
You've worked hard for this
for a long time.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.272
Thank you, Mom.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.473
You know I couldn't have
done it without you.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.535
Yeah.

18:09.567 --> 18:11.604
I'm glad you know it,
'cause it's true.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.909
I swear one day very soon
I'm gonna work hard enough...

18:13.933 --> 18:15.844
that you're not gonna
have to work again, Mom.

18:15.867 --> 18:17.869
I don't mind working, Johnny.

18:17.900 --> 18:21.313
It's a decent way
to make a living.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.109
Well, I know you don't mind.
That's why I do.

18:24.133 --> 18:26.170
Where's Georgia today?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.975
Yeah. Where is she?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.843
She's grounded.

18:29.867 --> 18:32.848
-Why?
-For knowing me.

18:32.867 --> 18:35.108
Yes. I can understand that.

18:35.133 --> 18:38.512
Popping off, Ma, huh?

18:38.533 --> 18:39.978
You ready for a little
pea in the head, Ma?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.276
Will you stop?
No, wait. Now, don't.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.473
You want another one?
Here it is. Whoa.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.843
All right. You stop.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.838
All right, that's it.
No dessert. What can I do?

18:51.867 --> 18:54.177
So, Ray, what did you think
of the game?

18:54.200 --> 18:57.306
You looked goofy.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.471
I looked what?

18:58.500 --> 18:59.706
Goofy.

18:59.733 --> 19:02.009
You didn't look in the mirror
today. You know why?

19:02.033 --> 19:04.013
'Cause you don't have any teeth.
When you get some front teeth...

19:04.033 --> 19:05.512
then you can tell me
how goofy I look.

19:05.533 --> 19:09.345
Until that moment comes along,
you can't say anything, OK?

19:09.367 --> 19:11.745
-OK? Do you hear me?
-Yes!

19:11.767 --> 19:13.542
-Say, "| hear you, Johnny."
-I hear you, Johnny!

19:13.567 --> 19:16.309
-Say, "| hear you, big brother."
-I hear you, big brother!

19:16.333 --> 19:20.110
-Say, "You are my man."
-You are my man.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.874
No. She just ate. Now...

19:21.900 --> 19:23.174
But much more importantly...

19:23.200 --> 19:24.838
what about Leo's
first touchdown ever?

19:24.867 --> 19:26.107
You looked good today.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.670
Thank you. Once I got the right
direction going, right?

19:28.700 --> 19:32.375
Why don't you ever eat
at your house, Leo?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.674
Why?

19:33.700 --> 19:37.147
Well, I think it's basically
because my parents hate me...

19:37.167 --> 19:39.408
and they have accused me
of carrying...

19:39.433 --> 19:42.414
an ammonia-filled tentacle
around with me...

19:42.433 --> 19:44.504
which, of course, I do not!

19:44.533 --> 19:47.275
What is this, the funny farm?

19:48.567 --> 19:51.480
I can understand
why they hate you.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.346
Johnny, my boy, you know.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.280
Listen. You've got to get
organized, you know?

19:57.300 --> 19:59.280
Now, you've had calls
from Michigan...

19:59.300 --> 20:02.543
UCC, Piermont and OI' Tex...

20:02.567 --> 20:06.208
LSU and Kansas and Cornell.

20:06.233 --> 20:09.009
What do you think, Mom?
Do I call these people back?

20:09.033 --> 20:13.709
Well, superstar, you can start
by clearing the table...

20:13.733 --> 20:15.804
and helping me with the dishes.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.502
Nice little reality break
from Mom there, huh?

20:18.533 --> 20:20.513
- Isn't that nice?
- Well, you're home now, son.

20:20.533 --> 20:21.511
Thank you, Gramp.

20:21.533 --> 20:24.480
This doesn't have a hook on it.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.604
And you are in trouble.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.271
You couldn't catch
a single monkfish...

20:27.300 --> 20:28.335
if you had to.

20:28.367 --> 20:31.177
-See you later.
-That a boy.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.645
A fish.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.237
Your family's really nice.

21:40.267 --> 21:42.543
Your <i>mom's</i> a terrible cook.

21:44.167 --> 21:45.339
Thank you.

21:45.367 --> 21:47.438
-Where are we going now?
-Georgia's.

21:47.467 --> 21:49.777
Really? I thought
she was grounded.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.370
I'm ungrounding her.

22:01.967 --> 22:03.173
Freeze, boy!

22:06.800 --> 22:09.906
I see.
It's gotta be a Rottweiler.

22:09.933 --> 22:13.346
There's no mistaking this.
That's no chihuahua.

22:15.967 --> 22:19.176
I thought her parents hated you.
It must be embarrassing.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.679
Yeah, well, she digs me.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.805
Her father is the one
who I have problems with.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.141
She'll come around.

22:26.467 --> 22:28.674
Mrs. Elkans, good evening.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.646
ls Georgia home?

22:30.667 --> 22:35.514
Yes...and that's where
she's going to stay.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.876
I just felt the love beam.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.402
She loves me.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.646
Freeze, dirtbags!

22:51.667 --> 22:55.046
I don't want you sniffing
around my daughter, Walker.

22:55.067 --> 22:56.171
What's shaking, Chief?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.612
Chief, how the hell was patrol?

22:58.633 --> 23:00.613
You're in big trouble, Walker.

23:00.633 --> 23:03.375
Chief, you can't keep me
away from your daughter.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.971
I'm gonna keep you away
from her forever.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.445
How you gonna do that, Chief?

23:07.467 --> 23:10.073
We're gonna settle this thing
once and for all.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.546
I can't just beat the shit
out of you...

23:12.567 --> 23:14.638
so we're gonna have us
a little game of football...

23:14.667 --> 23:16.112
and I'm gonna hurt you.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.841
I'm gonna play
with these two men right here.

23:18.867 --> 23:20.141
These men right here?

23:20.167 --> 23:22.943
OK, hold on. Let me get
a head count for a second.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.776
You got one, two,
three, four.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.508
That's a little unfair,
isn't it?

23:27.533 --> 23:29.638
Well, then you can play
with the big cheese.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.806
Oh, now I like it.
Chief, one last thing.

23:31.833 --> 23:35.303
Once we kick your butt,
Georgia's mine.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.244
Well, then,
just to make it fair...

23:37.267 --> 23:40.805
you're gonna get to play
with one hand behind your back.

23:40.833 --> 23:42.335
Isn't that cute?

23:42.367 --> 23:44.745
Chief, you don't play
with one hand, do you?

23:48.233 --> 23:50.179
Let's bless the ball.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.306
A little pooper
for the Troopers.

24:04.567 --> 24:07.047
Rotten little piss-ants.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.508
Go, John!

24:12.700 --> 24:15.943
Cheerleaders? Cheerleaders?

24:15.967 --> 24:17.105
Run!

24:18.400 --> 24:19.708
I got it, I got it.

24:19.733 --> 24:21.110
Luther!

24:49.333 --> 24:50.937
Can I see some I.D., please?

24:56.134 --> 24:58.375
Nice catch, Cooper.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.975
Yay, Troopers!

25:04.000 --> 25:06.310
Get 'em out of here.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.210
Oh, my God.

25:08.233 --> 25:09.234
Hut!

25:12.000 --> 25:14.139
Hey, fat man, get out of here.

25:14.167 --> 25:15.703
I'm out of here.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.409
Look at him go.
Look at the chief.

25:25.433 --> 25:26.810
Wait a second.

25:26.833 --> 25:28.506
That's a $20 ball.
That's a game ball.

25:28.533 --> 25:30.535
Let's get him.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.046
It started last weekend

25:43.067 --> 25:45.775
At the Yale-Harvard game

25:45.800 --> 25:49.373
10:38. This movie is shit.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.439
Girl, I saw your beaver flash

25:53.467 --> 25:58.314
I'll never be the same

25:58.334 --> 26:01.872
Oh, no

26:04.867 --> 26:10.112
You gave me a soul kiss

26:10.133 --> 26:14.411
Oh, it sure was grand

26:14.434 --> 26:17.779
Johnny,
now that I'm homeless...

26:17.800 --> 26:19.609
what do you plan to do with me?

26:19.633 --> 26:21.203
I'm gonna love you.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.880
And I'm gonna marry you.

26:26.933 --> 26:31.279
And that should take care
of about sixty years.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.803
ls that a threat or a promise?

26:33.833 --> 26:36.939
That's a threat.

26:36.967 --> 26:39.072
I'm getting old, though.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.443
Yeah, real old.

26:40.467 --> 26:41.775
I'm serious.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.713
Next thing you know,
I'll be on the beach...

26:44.734 --> 26:49.649
with that big belly,
sporting the bikini underwear...

26:49.667 --> 26:50.907
just walking.

26:52.934 --> 26:54.811
Then comes gray hair.

26:54.833 --> 26:58.440
Then comes ear hair,
coming out of my ears.

26:58.467 --> 27:01.277
Then comes white hair.
Then comes no hair.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.041
Then comes no teeth.

27:03.067 --> 27:06.276
Then, boom,
you're 70 years old.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.904
Or 80.

27:07.933 --> 27:10.504
Ooh, nature.

27:10.534 --> 27:12.514
I'll be there.

27:24.433 --> 27:27.642
You kids having a good time?

27:30.400 --> 27:33.006
Hi, John. Johnny Ballgame.

27:33.033 --> 27:35.570
All right. Now, I don't mean
to interrupt you.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.341
I just want you
to know, John...

27:37.367 --> 27:40.746
that there's a lot of phony hype
with all these schools.

27:40.767 --> 27:42.940
Now, I know you better
than you know yourself...

27:42.967 --> 27:46.540
and right now the best situation
for you is Piermont.

27:46.567 --> 27:48.877
Oh, yeah, Coach?

27:48.900 --> 27:50.208
-Really.
-Yeah?

27:50.234 --> 27:53.181
Can I tell them you'll come down
for a visit this weekend?

27:53.200 --> 27:54.201
Coach.

27:56.634 --> 28:00.480
You'd be my horse
if you never even ran a race.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.480
OK, I'll be there.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.673
-Johnny Ballgame.
-OK.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.112
I'll have 'em send you
a plane ticket.

28:07.133 --> 28:10.205
You know I've always been
fond of you, kid.

28:10.233 --> 28:11.507
Thank you, Coach.

28:11.533 --> 28:14.309
I'm fond of your Pacer.

28:14.334 --> 28:15.369
Thank you.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.936
I'm most fond of it.

28:16.967 --> 28:19.345
Hey, you could have
one of these someday.

28:19.367 --> 28:20.869
Don't tease me, Coach.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.846
That's the last damn school
I'd ever visit in my life.

28:28.867 --> 28:31.370
Johnny, why are you visiting
all these schools?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.505
I thought we planned
to go to State...

28:35.533 --> 28:37.672
to be together.

28:39.533 --> 28:41.604
I can't just ignore
the opportunity...

28:41.634 --> 28:45.172
to go see schools,
to see the country.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.407
You wouldn't want that.

28:49.634 --> 28:52.410
Come on. When you get
that look on your face--

28:52.433 --> 28:53.571
Let me get a kiss, please.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.773
Like, let me get
a Georgia fish kiss.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.246
Come get it.

29:01.133 --> 29:02.510
Come get it?

29:04.034 --> 29:05.411
l will.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.470
It's the way to travel,
ain't it, soldier?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.480
Huh? You see
the country here and...

29:32.500 --> 29:35.310
first-class bucket seats.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.335
The price is right, too, huh?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.971
What are you, a private?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.038
Hey, I'm trying to eat.
You mind?

29:46.067 --> 29:48.013
Hey, this is a family bus here.

29:48.033 --> 29:51.242
Hey, Slim.
Hey, I'm trying to eat.

29:51.267 --> 29:54.840
Hey, Slim.
Knock it off, will you?

30:06.067 --> 30:08.570
I wonder if that's
the OI' Tex plane.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.307
Have you seen a lot
of commercial airlines...

30:10.333 --> 30:12.108
that look like
a flying horny toad?

30:12.133 --> 30:13.168
No.

30:23.567 --> 30:26.377
Get off that. No. Please.

30:30.167 --> 30:33.011
-Hi. How y'all doing?
-How you doing? Good to see you.

30:33.033 --> 30:35.980
My name's Tex Wade. I'm gonna be
your host for the weekend.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.537
I'm gonna make sure
you get everything you want...

30:38.567 --> 30:40.308
from your visit to OI' Tex.

30:40.333 --> 30:43.678
Well, thank you, Tex.
You got a lot of style, Tex.

30:43.700 --> 30:47.341
How about a little something
to blur your vision, Johnny?

30:47.367 --> 30:50.007
- No, thanks, Tex.
- Well, then hop in.

30:50.033 --> 30:52.172
OK. Bye, Georgia.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.271
Johnny, be good.

30:57.667 --> 31:00.045
Come on in, Tex.

31:00.067 --> 31:02.138
Georgia, can you see his boots?

31:03.834 --> 31:05.142
See you, Georgia.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.578
Just kidding, Tex.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.443
Aw, man!

31:23.800 --> 31:25.780
Where is that punk?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.302
Excuse me?

31:27.333 --> 31:29.609
I'm not talking to you, lady.

31:29.634 --> 31:30.977
What a jerk.

31:36.733 --> 31:40.203
Thinks his time is more valuable
than mine, I guess.

31:40.233 --> 31:43.407
Probably stroking
his muskrat somewhere.

31:47.633 --> 31:49.203
Sit down, Coach.

31:49.233 --> 31:50.974
Oh, thank you.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.878
You're late. Where's the kid?

31:54.900 --> 31:58.507
They sprung a math test on him.

31:58.534 --> 31:59.774
You believe that?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.609
He'll be flying down
a little later.

32:01.634 --> 32:03.841
Actually, I should
give him a little call.

32:03.867 --> 32:05.369
Use the phone
back there, please.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.845
Yeah.

32:06.867 --> 32:08.813
You should have seen
that airport.

32:08.833 --> 32:09.971
What a madhouse.

32:11.034 --> 32:13.605
It's a beautiful office,
Chancellor.

32:13.633 --> 32:15.806
Not too shabby.

32:17.067 --> 32:19.013
John, how are you?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.206
What's the matter?

32:21.233 --> 32:23.008
Well, that's terrible.

32:23.033 --> 32:25.172
Listen.
Don't worry about a thing.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.441
We'll just reschedule
the meeting, OK?

32:27.467 --> 32:30.243
I know you want
to come here with me.

32:30.267 --> 32:31.769
You haven't hurt your chances.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.838
Now, look. As soon as I get
off the airplane...

32:34.867 --> 32:36.642
I'm coming right over
to see you.

32:36.667 --> 32:39.147
I love you, too, son.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.202
Bye-bye.

32:41.534 --> 32:43.013
That's a great kid.

33:11.633 --> 33:15.604
I want you to feel
right at home, like family.

33:15.633 --> 33:18.307
Like this was
your very own ranch.

33:18.334 --> 33:20.780
Look, this comes straight
from the heart, John.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.041
Everybody here loves you.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.047
You see these long-stemmed
American beauties here?

33:25.067 --> 33:26.671
They're all for you.
They're yours.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.306
That grass is yours.
This whole shindig is yours.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.246
Them trees are yours.
Hell, that lake is yours.

33:32.267 --> 33:33.769
ls this part
of the campus, Tex?

33:33.800 --> 33:35.973
You could call it
part of the campus, Johnny.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.470
You come to OI' Tex, you can
call it anything you want.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.706
I love OI' Tex.

33:40.734 --> 33:43.510
Margarita, Mr. Wade?
-Don't mind if we do, darling.

33:43.533 --> 33:44.637
Here you go.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.544
Never had one of these.

33:46.567 --> 33:50.447
Shit. Everybody drinks
margaritas at OI' Tex.

33:50.467 --> 33:52.344
Feisty little filly, ain't she?

33:52.367 --> 33:54.711
My wife says they're medicinal.

33:54.733 --> 33:55.973
The ride has started!

33:56.000 --> 33:57.411
He's out of the chute.

33:57.433 --> 33:59.504
He's riding that--

33:59.533 --> 34:00.910
B.B., what's shaking?

34:00.933 --> 34:03.504
Come on, break yourself loose
and say hi to Johnny Walker.

34:03.534 --> 34:06.140
Johnny, captain of the team,
Bad Breath Banister.

34:06.167 --> 34:07.475
Tough duty, B.B.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.309
That boy's breath
would gag a maggot.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.335
I know it, Tex,
but he's gotta be...

34:12.400 --> 34:14.107
Ladies and gents...

34:14.132 --> 34:17.205
can I have your attention
for one minute?

34:17.233 --> 34:19.804
I want to introduce to you...

34:19.833 --> 34:23.143
five of the most sought-after
football players...

34:23.167 --> 34:26.080
in the entire country.

34:26.100 --> 34:28.101
Boys, come on now.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.510
Step up here.

34:34.266 --> 34:36.975
We want you! We want you!

34:37.000 --> 34:38.946
And you're gonna get 'em!

34:38.967 --> 34:40.878
This here is Flick Weaver...

34:40.900 --> 34:42.436
Pete Andropolous...

34:42.467 --> 34:44.639
Benny Figg...

34:44.667 --> 34:47.580
and that hunk
of Mexican-Samoan man flesh...

34:47.600 --> 34:49.601
Jose Fopupu.

34:49.634 --> 34:53.206
And last, but not least,
Johnny "Rocket Arm" Walker.

34:53.233 --> 34:56.578
We want you! We want you!

34:56.600 --> 35:00.013
Hail all to OI' Tex

35:00.034 --> 35:03.447
Let the spirit lead

35:03.467 --> 35:06.846
Hail all to OI' Tex

35:06.867 --> 35:10.212
On to victory

35:10.234 --> 35:14.614
Our minds and hearts
are with you

35:14.633 --> 35:19.514
Your hallowed halls we praise

35:19.533 --> 35:22.537
Hail all to OI' Tex

35:22.567 --> 35:27.243
All the live-long day

35:44.100 --> 35:45.545
OI' Tex is great.

35:45.567 --> 35:49.014
Yeah, but it can't come close
to the money Piermont offered.

35:49.034 --> 35:50.638
Man, only that
junk bond bullshit.

35:50.667 --> 35:52.340
I'm splitting.

35:52.367 --> 35:53.710
Where are you going?

35:53.734 --> 35:55.611
I'm going to get some Chinese.

35:55.634 --> 35:57.204
Man, ain't you full yet,
brother?

35:57.234 --> 36:00.340
I'm not talking about food.
I told Tex I'd only come...

36:00.367 --> 36:02.404
to visit if he got me
two Chinese girls.

36:02.434 --> 36:04.414
-Yo, Slick.
-He did!

36:04.433 --> 36:06.811
Poontang foo-yang, hoss.

36:06.834 --> 36:11.214
We're gonna show you
a real good time.

36:11.234 --> 36:12.577
How you doing, Carmen?

36:12.600 --> 36:14.580
I'm glad to see you.
Ralph, what's up with you, man?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.273
How you doing?
How's it feeling, man?

36:16.300 --> 36:18.177
Yeah? Things looking up?

36:18.200 --> 36:19.645
Aw, the stock market's down.

36:19.667 --> 36:21.704
Stocks are down, huh?
How's your wife, man?

36:21.734 --> 36:22.712
Oh, fair.

36:22.734 --> 36:24.338
I need a partner.

36:24.367 --> 36:26.040
-Still picking pockets, man?
-Yeah.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.904
lam here to tell you
that it is my responsibility...

36:36.934 --> 36:40.313
to welcome you
to the fold of OI' Tex.

36:40.334 --> 36:44.714
Sort of like a queen bee
with a hive...

36:44.734 --> 36:46.338
and I never miss.

36:46.367 --> 36:49.177
I got me a player
in every class.

36:51.367 --> 36:55.713
In order to prepare you
for tonight's experience...

36:55.734 --> 36:57.805
we need to do a little
hot heart exercise.

36:57.834 --> 36:59.905
Now I'm gonna send you
some energy.

37:01.534 --> 37:02.808
Do you feel it?

37:02.834 --> 37:04.279
Do you feel it?

37:04.300 --> 37:06.109
I feel it. I feel good.

37:06.134 --> 37:08.637
-Do you feel the heat?
-I feel the heat.

37:08.667 --> 37:11.011
OK, OK. I feel it, too.

37:11.034 --> 37:12.513
OK, now.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.777
How'd you like to go
visit our campus?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.837
Where the hell
is that campus, by the way?

37:17.867 --> 37:19.972
Well, I'm glad you asked...

37:20.000 --> 37:22.207
because I'm gonna
take you there right now.

37:22.234 --> 37:23.235
Thank you, ma'am.

37:23.267 --> 37:28.273
Well, let us grab
our drinks and vamoose.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.677
Ooh, numero uno.

37:31.534 --> 37:33.605
lam going to show you,
you lucky boy...

37:33.634 --> 37:36.945
why they call us
the Horny Toads.

37:36.967 --> 37:40.744
Why, darling, this is far more
than a football team.

37:40.767 --> 37:42.075
Armadillo.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.273
I mean, we have a very fine
medical program...

37:44.300 --> 37:47.440
in which many operators
come out successfully.

37:47.467 --> 37:48.537
Oh, is that right?

37:48.567 --> 37:50.308
Well, you understand
the word "operator"?

37:50.334 --> 37:51.312
Not at all.

37:51.334 --> 37:53.336
-Was that your hand?
-That was yours.

37:53.367 --> 37:56.439
Oh, well,
that was my hand, darling.

37:56.467 --> 38:01.280
I thought it was a pillow,
but I can see I was mistaken.

38:01.300 --> 38:04.440
And as you can see,
we have a very fine library.

38:04.467 --> 38:05.707
Right. I can see that.

38:05.734 --> 38:09.079
Well, we'll see
the library now.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.270
Excuse me.

38:18.134 --> 38:21.604
Listen, if you're
not interested in her...

38:21.634 --> 38:25.639
I may know someone
a little more your speed.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.610
Now, darling...

38:31.633 --> 38:36.104
I thought this would be
a more intimate place to dine.

38:36.134 --> 38:37.613
A little more spacious.

38:37.634 --> 38:39.944
I can't believe
the size of this campus.

38:39.967 --> 38:42.277
- It's huge.
- Well, you bet.

38:42.300 --> 38:44.507
They're all gonna be saying it--
"Go, Johnny, go."

38:44.534 --> 38:48.107
In the fall, 80,000 people will
be cheering you on, darling.

38:48.134 --> 38:49.613
Johnny Walker!

38:49.634 --> 38:53.309
And I can guarantee you
something, sweetheart.

38:53.334 --> 38:54.677
It will be nothing...

38:54.700 --> 38:57.180
like the performance
I am about to give.

38:59.134 --> 39:00.442
Oh, no.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.044
Oh. Ouch.

39:05.067 --> 39:06.045
Oh, boink.

39:06.067 --> 39:07.478
Thank you so much.

39:07.500 --> 39:08.774
Matter of fact...

39:08.800 --> 39:11.371
I should start abusing
that term-thank you--

39:11.400 --> 39:14.813
because it can get me
in and out of more situations...

39:14.833 --> 39:16.574
with smooth sincerity.

39:18.067 --> 39:19.876
Absolutely the best thing
I could say...

39:19.900 --> 39:21.311
is thank you right now.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.176
Thank you and...

39:23.200 --> 39:25.180
well, thank you. Thank you.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.679
Darling, you talk too much.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.179
Wait a minute. No, thank you.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.202
See, I'm not the type
of guy who thinks--

39:30.234 --> 39:32.236
-Joe Bob!
-Yo!

39:32.267 --> 39:34.679
Tell 'em about
the OI' Tex baby dolls...

39:34.700 --> 39:38.671
and how they like to sneak
in the locker room at halftime.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.680
Lord have mercy, boys.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.681
We spend $20,000 a month on
these pretty little fillies...

39:43.700 --> 39:46.180
just for the football
program alone.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.804
You gonna like it here.

39:47.834 --> 39:52.180
Please stop. Stop.
l--thank you very much.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.181
Miss, look, thank you. No.
You're making this hard enough.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.543
Please stop.

39:58.300 --> 40:01.042
Jose, come on down here, boy.
I wanna show you your future.

40:01.067 --> 40:02.273
Ride 'em, cowboy!

40:02.300 --> 40:04.280
Speaking of luxury,
if my eyes don't deceive me...

40:04.300 --> 40:06.177
that's a boy getting
his knob polished...

40:06.200 --> 40:07.873
right there
on the fifty-yard line.

40:07.900 --> 40:08.970
Say what?

40:09.000 --> 40:12.072
I gotta go, you understand?

40:12.100 --> 40:15.104
Oh, wait! Where are you--
Don't leave!

40:15.134 --> 40:17.842
And |--stop!
Stop! Let me go.

40:17.867 --> 40:20.507
Oh, I gotta put this up
on the scoreboard...

40:20.534 --> 40:22.013
see it a little clearer.

40:23.234 --> 40:26.738
I have to go.
No, I'm not a homosexual.

40:26.767 --> 40:28.678
I have to go.

40:28.700 --> 40:30.179
No, you don't.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.680
By God. I'll be dipped
in dog shit.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.179
That's Johnny Walker.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.679
What the--

40:35.700 --> 40:38.510
Shit. That's my wife!

40:38.534 --> 40:39.979
That's your wife?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.503
Who said that? Wait a minute.
Please. You have a husband?

40:42.534 --> 40:44.172
I'm getting out of here now.
This is it, and I'm out.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.044
And put those tits away.
This was no med school.

40:47.067 --> 40:49.047
-This was not a library!
-I wanna play ball!

40:49.067 --> 40:50.205
I have to go!

40:50.234 --> 40:53.181
I won't put away my tits
before you get back here!

40:53.200 --> 40:55.180
Come back here, you |i|' boy!

40:55.200 --> 40:56.679
I gotta go! No, no!

40:56.700 --> 40:59.203
Come back here!
I can make you feel good!

41:07.634 --> 41:10.046
Get your butt
in this car, boy! Now!

41:10.067 --> 41:11.546
Come on, let's go!

41:11.567 --> 41:13.046
You wanna go? Get in!

41:15.034 --> 41:17.014
Hey, don't be doing
that to the paint!

41:17.034 --> 41:19.514
Tex'll have my behind for that.

41:19.533 --> 41:21.706
Don't be doing that.
Get in. Come on.

41:27.633 --> 41:30.045
Oh, so this is
the medical school.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.276
Hey, boys, come on down here!

41:49.300 --> 41:51.803
Got the entire front row
for y'all!

42:00.500 --> 42:02.002
Oh, my gosh!

42:02.034 --> 42:03.138
It's looking very good!

42:03.167 --> 42:04.168
Oh, no.

42:35.567 --> 42:37.547
Sure was nice of 0|‘ Tex
to let us use his car.

42:37.567 --> 42:40.707
Goddamn! It was nice of him
to give us his wife!

42:43.267 --> 42:45.941
- Fill 'er up?
- Yes, sir, with beer.

42:45.967 --> 42:47.412
<i>HEY-</i>

42:47.434 --> 42:49.573
Get you guys a beer
or maybe two.

42:51.067 --> 42:52.375
How you doing?

42:52.400 --> 42:55.210
-Doing good. How you doing?
-Good, good.

42:55.234 --> 42:57.771
You going to play football
at OI' Tex?

42:57.800 --> 43:00.041
Oh, I don't know yet.

43:00.067 --> 43:03.048
You know, I used to be
a football player.

43:03.067 --> 43:05.479
They said I would've
been all-American...

43:05.500 --> 43:07.537
if I hadn't hurt my leg.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.479
What happened?

43:10.500 --> 43:12.980
Did you go to OI' Tex?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.344
I was going to, but...

43:15.367 --> 43:17.973
I never got the chance.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.980
After they took
my scholarship away...

43:20.000 --> 43:21.479
I had to quit school.

43:21.500 --> 43:22.979
But...

43:23.000 --> 43:25.776
OI' Tex took care of me,
got me this job.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.838
I ain't complaining.

43:37.867 --> 43:38.971
<i>HEY-</i>

43:39.000 --> 43:40.980
- Yeah, buddy.
- Party!

43:41.000 --> 43:43.173
Yeah! Gonna party tonight!

43:48.000 --> 43:50.241
What's this stuff, man?

43:54.367 --> 43:55.539
What is it?

43:59.500 --> 44:01.741
That's Texas sushi, boy.

44:01.767 --> 44:03.804
Forget you, man.

44:08.767 --> 44:10.405
Come on. We're out of here.

44:10.434 --> 44:11.913
Let's jam.

44:11.934 --> 44:12.969
Move it out! All right.

44:30.567 --> 44:32.069
There he is!

44:32.100 --> 44:34.842
Hey, Johnny,
why'd you visit OI' Tex?

44:34.867 --> 44:37.074
I need silence.
I need silence.

44:37.100 --> 44:39.774
Why'd you go there
in the first place?

44:39.800 --> 44:41.780
Come on, you're smarter
than that, Johnny.

44:41.800 --> 44:43.108
I don't know. I don't know.

44:43.134 --> 44:46.775
Until you signed your letter,
nothing else means squat.

44:49.634 --> 44:51.238
Hey. Hello there.

44:51.267 --> 44:53.611
Hi, honey.

44:53.634 --> 44:55.614
How was the campus?

44:55.633 --> 44:57.078
The campus.

44:57.100 --> 45:00.104
Right. It was nice, Mom.

45:00.134 --> 45:02.944
Yeah, it was nice.
It really was a nice campus.

45:02.967 --> 45:05.538
Well, you think of OI' Tex as
just a football school, right?

45:05.567 --> 45:06.773
And in actuality...

45:06.800 --> 45:10.407
they have the finest
pre-med school in the country.

45:10.434 --> 45:13.347
Really. Just a fierce--
it was a beautiful setup.

45:13.367 --> 45:15.847
Yeah, it was nice.
It really was.

45:15.867 --> 45:20.009
Listen, something wonderful
happened while you were away.

45:20.034 --> 45:22.537
This fella calls up
on the telephone, see...

45:22.567 --> 45:26.014
and he orders 10,000
walleyed gibblers.

45:26.033 --> 45:27.444
Apparently
he gives them away...

45:27.467 --> 45:29.037
on his late-night
television show...

45:29.067 --> 45:32.674
like those Veg-a-matics or those
spiffy little fishing rods...

45:32.700 --> 45:35.840
that turn into can openers.

45:35.867 --> 45:39.838
We could make a small fortune
on this deal, you know?

45:39.867 --> 45:41.847
That's excellent, Gramp.

45:41.867 --> 45:43.847
Yeah. So he called?

45:43.867 --> 45:46.848
The fella says
so long as they sell...

45:46.867 --> 45:48.847
the orders
will just keep coming in.

45:48.867 --> 45:51.848
You know, we could maybe
buy a larger house.

45:51.867 --> 45:54.905
That'll really catch
a lot of fish.

45:55.100 --> 45:56.977
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hey, Monica.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.877
Don't you bruise
those tomatoes now.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.970
Have you folks tried
those biscuits?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.139
- They're delicious.
- What'd he say?

46:06.167 --> 46:07.339
Pick a school yet, Johnny?

46:07.367 --> 46:09.142
Baby love.

46:09.167 --> 46:12.114
Hey. How was it?

46:12.134 --> 46:16.105
It was cool. It was good.
I had a good time.

46:16.134 --> 46:18.307
Yeah?

46:18.334 --> 46:20.439
So how were the girls?

46:20.467 --> 46:23.346
The girls.

46:23.367 --> 46:25.369
How were the girls?

46:26.367 --> 46:28.369
Well, they were...

46:29.867 --> 46:31.540
very short...

46:31.567 --> 46:33.569
very fat...

46:33.600 --> 46:35.841
and kinda weird looking.

46:35.867 --> 46:36.971
What was her name?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.810
- Huh?
- What was her name?

46:41.967 --> 46:43.776
The woman I had dinner with
was Lawanda.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.108
That was Tex's wife.

46:45.134 --> 46:46.442
Lawanda?

46:46.467 --> 46:49.209
Very old chick. Very fat woman.

46:49.233 --> 46:51.008
And very funny looking.

46:51.034 --> 46:54.015
She took me to dinner,
and, you know...

46:54.033 --> 46:58.482
"What do you think of Texas?"
And, you know, "I love it."

46:58.500 --> 47:00.776
Lot of small talk.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.939
I didn't--you know,
I didn't do anything...

47:02.967 --> 47:05.504
or, you know, touched her.

47:09.234 --> 47:11.145
What are you thinking about?

47:13.400 --> 47:15.744
I think you're an asshole!

47:28.134 --> 47:30.740
This boy-girl shit hurts, man.

47:31.734 --> 47:34.214
Oh, no. None of that.

47:34.234 --> 47:36.714
It's a bogus product.
It's a payoff.

47:36.734 --> 47:39.908
No self-respecting fish would
go near a walleyed gibbler.

47:39.934 --> 47:42.710
Hey, Leo, read my lips.

47:42.734 --> 47:44.714
Joe Bob promised
my grandfather...

47:44.734 --> 47:46.714
he'd by 10,000
of the things, OK?

47:46.734 --> 47:48.714
Dude, you're confused.
You're repeating yourself.

47:48.734 --> 47:51.146
- Maybe you're wrong.
- Well...

47:51.167 --> 47:53.909
I couldn't break his heart
like that.

47:53.934 --> 47:56.380
Well, you can't commit
to OI' Tex.

47:56.400 --> 47:59.779
I'll tell you something, Leo,
I had such a groove in Texas.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.438
I vomited margaritas
the whole way home...

48:01.467 --> 48:02.912
but it was beautiful.
I'm telling you.

48:02.933 --> 48:04.503
Well, perhaps
you'll spew forth...

48:04.534 --> 48:06.309
the drink of every school
you visit.

48:06.334 --> 48:07.972
I like that.
I'll keep it in mind.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.673
Give me a hand. Howdy, Chief!

48:09.700 --> 48:11.145
Dirtbags!

48:12.134 --> 48:16.173
UCC, UCC, UCC.

48:17.500 --> 48:20.811
What's shaking, Coach?
I didn't know you'd show.

48:20.834 --> 48:22.973
Coach, how do you feel?

48:23.000 --> 48:26.812
John, you promised me
you were gonna visit Piermont.

48:26.833 --> 48:30.406
He's not going to Piermont.
You get it? Got it?

48:30.434 --> 48:31.777
And goose yourself.

48:33.667 --> 48:37.513
If I want any shit out of you,
Leo, I'll squeeze your head.

48:40.134 --> 48:42.876
You better listen to me, son.

48:42.900 --> 48:46.973
You're on the verge of
destroying your entire career.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.207
I'm not gonna let it happen.

48:49.233 --> 48:51.144
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes...

48:51.167 --> 48:53.545
to make sure you do
the right thing.

49:04.434 --> 49:05.970
You keep playing games
with me...

49:06.000 --> 49:09.140
you're gonna end up waiting
on tables with this guy.

49:09.167 --> 49:11.579
That was cold-blooded, Coach.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.706
- Coach, where's your shoes?
- Forgot those shoes, Coach.

49:14.900 --> 49:19.280
Are you sure Tom won't want
to order more of my lures?

49:19.300 --> 49:23.271
We haven't sold one
in three years.

49:23.300 --> 49:26.679
Well, Harvey, you tell him that
a big shot down in Texas...

49:26.700 --> 49:28.680
just ordered 10,000 of them.

49:28.700 --> 49:32.546
Reckon the fish in that state
are gonna be safe for a while.

49:56.600 --> 49:59.240
Grandpa Walker,
can I have a word with you?

49:59.267 --> 50:01.076
Sure, Coach. Sit down.

50:01.100 --> 50:02.579
Got some bad news.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.443
You know Tom Norman?

50:04.467 --> 50:07.073
Well, he owns this shop.
Fishing buddy.

50:07.100 --> 50:08.545
What's happened?

50:08.567 --> 50:10.205
Well, apparently
he's very connected...

50:10.234 --> 50:12.077
with some of the alumni
from Piermont.

50:12.100 --> 50:14.171
Tom tells me that if Johnny
doesn't go to Fiermont...

50:14.200 --> 50:17.545
he's gonna have to cut off
your credit here.

50:17.567 --> 50:21.071
Hey, I hear you're
flunking English. Ouch.

50:21.100 --> 50:23.603
John, you need
that English, son.

50:31.100 --> 50:32.408
You did your term paper...

50:32.433 --> 50:34.413
on the American
hardware store, huh?

50:34.434 --> 50:35.742
Maybe you deserved that

50:35.767 --> 50:37.872
I don't want to hear about it.
It's a very legitimate topic.

50:37.900 --> 50:41.006
- Yes, it is, and I must read it.
- I know you wanted to.

50:41.034 --> 50:43.605
So, Leo, I think you know
why we're here today.

50:43.634 --> 50:45.409
I think you do.

50:45.434 --> 50:47.573
Hisler's been messing
with me, Leo.

50:47.600 --> 50:50.080
He's been messing
with my grandfather...

50:50.100 --> 50:52.580
been messing
with my little brother...

50:52.600 --> 50:54.102
my little sister.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.910
Been messing with my mom, Leo.

50:57.934 --> 51:01.575
He's been talking to her,
messing with her.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.580
And now...

51:03.600 --> 51:05.341
we're gonna mess with him, Leo.

51:05.367 --> 51:06.505
Are you with me?

51:06.534 --> 51:07.808
Die!

51:10.034 --> 51:11.809
Gonna ruin his life

51:11.834 --> 51:13.677
Gonna ruin it good

51:13.700 --> 51:15.509
Gonna do the wrong thing

51:15.533 --> 51:17.012
Like I thought I could

51:17.033 --> 51:19.309
Oh, Leo, vengeance is mine.
Made all the calls, did you?

51:19.334 --> 51:21.507
It all comes together now.

51:21.533 --> 51:24.104
Wait till you see
these chihuahuas.

51:25.867 --> 51:28.040
Hut, hut, hut.

51:31.533 --> 51:34.013
Hello, John.
Glad you boys came by.

51:34.034 --> 51:36.014
The wife has
a Tupperware party...

51:36.033 --> 51:38.013
but we can talk in the den
if you like.

51:38.034 --> 51:39.513
I'd appreciate that, Coach.

51:39.534 --> 51:42.037
- Come right in, please.
- Thank you. Thank you.

51:42.067 --> 51:45.014
It has a green lid.

51:45.034 --> 51:46.513
It has blue.

51:46.534 --> 51:49.811
It has...purple.
See that purple?

51:49.834 --> 51:53.281
You boys met my children
before-Sugar and Honey?

51:53.300 --> 51:54.335
Oh, I love your kids.

51:54.367 --> 51:55.846
I've been giving
a lot of thought...

51:55.867 --> 51:57.676
to what you told me
about Piermont. I really have.

51:57.700 --> 51:59.577
That's good.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.602
Except I'm having a little
problem with my English grade.

52:01.633 --> 52:03.510
Really?

52:03.533 --> 52:05.945
Yeah. I thought you could help.

52:05.967 --> 52:10.006
I might be able
to help you out with that. Sure.

52:10.034 --> 52:11.707
I thought you could, Coach.

52:13.967 --> 52:15.105
Stick with me, Johnny.

52:15.134 --> 52:18.115
- More company, honey?
- Don't get up, Pumpkin.

52:18.134 --> 52:21.445
- Keep selling your goods.
- OK, now, I have...

52:21.467 --> 52:23.105
Pizza delivery for Hitler.

52:23.134 --> 52:24.977
Hitler? Hisler. Hisler.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.412
Where you going?
Wait a minute, fellas.

52:27.433 --> 52:29.435
Wait a minute.
I didn't order any pizza.

52:29.467 --> 52:32.277
$283.
- No, it won't be $283.

52:32.300 --> 52:33.802
I didn't order any pizza.

52:33.833 --> 52:35.813
Look, pal, you order pizza,
we bring you pizza.

52:35.834 --> 52:37.609
- Hey, listen, you like pizza?
- Sure.

52:37.634 --> 52:41.241
Yeah, you like it? All right.
You eat the pizza!

52:43.834 --> 52:45.711
What are you doing?

52:45.734 --> 52:48.271
Can't you take a joke, mister?

52:48.300 --> 52:51.110
Go back!
Connie, get my shotgun!

52:52.700 --> 52:54.304
Honey, I'm coming!

52:54.333 --> 52:56.438
Can I have the rest
of the pizzas?

53:05.067 --> 53:06.546
Is it for me?

53:06.567 --> 53:09.013
No! It's for nobody!
Get out of here now!

53:14.567 --> 53:17.707
Whoa! Wait a minute!
Where you going?

53:17.734 --> 53:19.407
I'm from D.O.A. Exterminators.

53:19.434 --> 53:21.277
Hear you got a problem
with rodents.

53:21.300 --> 53:23.041
I got no rodents!

53:23.067 --> 53:24.705
I'm gonna take care
of my own rodents.

53:24.734 --> 53:26.771
Out, out, out!

53:32.067 --> 53:35.105
Coach, we're even now.

53:35.134 --> 53:36.704
How do you turn this thing off?

53:36.734 --> 53:37.804
Come on. Out.

53:38.834 --> 53:40.404
Connie, where are you?

54:30.200 --> 54:32.407
Number one.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.504
That's your number.

54:35.534 --> 54:37.480
Yeah, I was really surprised.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.502
No kidding, yeah.

54:40.667 --> 54:42.578
Definitely want
to see him, yeah.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.809
Fast like Homer Jones.
Remember Homer?

54:45.834 --> 54:48.405
Yeah, yeah.
Heck of a student.

54:48.433 --> 54:50.913
95 average--that's great.

54:50.934 --> 54:52.413
Let's have dinner next Tuesday.

54:52.434 --> 54:55.074
I gotta go.
Next Tuesday, OK?

54:55.100 --> 54:56.704
I really have to go. Bye-bye.

54:56.734 --> 55:00.978
What do you say, Coach?
How do you feel?

55:01.000 --> 55:04.914
Would you mind removing
your feet from my desk, please?

55:04.934 --> 55:07.312
Thank you.

55:07.334 --> 55:10.247
So, I came here to do some
business with you today, sir.

55:10.267 --> 55:11.746
I just got back from OI' Tex.

55:11.767 --> 55:14.407
They're ready to cut a sweet
and lucrative deal with me...

55:14.434 --> 55:16.380
except the thing is,
I want to play here.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.936
I want to come to State.

55:20.600 --> 55:23.137
Johnny, we don't
give out deals here.

55:24.434 --> 55:26.414
What?

55:26.433 --> 55:30.438
We give the usual scholarship:
Room and board...

55:30.467 --> 55:32.413
a good education.

55:32.434 --> 55:35.904
Everyone has to actually
go to class here.

55:35.934 --> 55:37.914
And I like to believe...

55:37.933 --> 55:40.174
that we offer a good background
in football.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.146
We had a lot of players
go into pro ball.

55:42.167 --> 55:45.944
That's nice, Coach, but...

55:45.967 --> 55:48.004
you're losing the top
high school athletes...

55:48.034 --> 55:50.344
every year for a reason.

55:50.367 --> 55:51.869
What's that?

55:54.034 --> 55:55.672
Well, you're not
giving them anything.

55:55.700 --> 55:57.839
You gotta show them something.
They gotta see something.

55:57.867 --> 55:59.505
They gotta know that
they're gonna get something--

55:59.534 --> 56:03.346
cash, you know,
cars, apartments, money.

56:03.367 --> 56:05.506
Hook-ups, you know what I mean?

56:05.534 --> 56:08.208
We're looking for benefits
these days, Coach.

56:08.233 --> 56:11.339
Look, Johnny, I like you...

56:11.367 --> 56:14.348
so I'm not gonna B.S. you.

56:14.367 --> 56:15.846
You're a good athlete.

56:15.867 --> 56:19.838
You have a lot of talent
and a lot of energy.

56:19.867 --> 56:21.505
So I'm warning you...

56:21.534 --> 56:24.140
you're getting into something
that you don't understand.

56:24.167 --> 56:27.011
See, when word goes out
that a kid like yourself...

56:27.033 --> 56:28.740
is looking for a deal...

56:28.767 --> 56:31.873
believe me, that deal turns out
to be a lot stronger...

56:31.900 --> 56:33.641
than that kid
ever bargained for.

56:35.367 --> 56:36.846
Be careful.

56:36.867 --> 56:38.710
You're playing with fire.

57:09.300 --> 57:11.302
Are you crazy?

57:11.334 --> 57:14.213
My father sleeps with his gun.

57:17.367 --> 57:19.472
I heard you visited State.

57:22.967 --> 57:25.641
Does this mean
your lobotomy's worn off?

57:29.634 --> 57:31.272
Well...

57:31.300 --> 57:36.477
since you're not going to speak,
you will rub my feet.

57:39.967 --> 57:42.413
I mean, far be it for me
to ask you to apologize...

57:42.434 --> 57:45.608
when you have behaved like
a complete son of a bitch...

57:45.634 --> 57:47.238
but...

58:11.067 --> 58:14.879
"Flowers that have festered
smell far worse than weeds."

58:16.400 --> 58:19.745
That means...you stink.

58:23.234 --> 58:24.907
But it was sweet.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.038
I guess
lam still sweet on you.

58:29.067 --> 58:31.547
I'll cut in ten minutes.

58:31.567 --> 58:33.706
You're a bombshell.

58:40.333 --> 58:41.641
<i>“Cc!</i>

58:41.667 --> 58:44.580
- We're going to 0l' Tex.
- No, we're not.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.079
People in Texas...

58:48.100 --> 58:49.579
sorry-

58:49.600 --> 58:50.601
Cool.

58:53.234 --> 58:55.578
No real shots!
No real shots!

58:55.600 --> 58:56.601
Punk!

59:00.767 --> 59:03.145
- You wouldn't really use that.
- Yes, I would.

59:03.167 --> 59:06.114
- No, you're not gonna use that.
- Yes, I would.

59:07.100 --> 59:08.579
Leo.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.079
What?

59:10.100 --> 59:13.274
What do you really want
out of life, huh?

59:13.300 --> 59:16.372
I want Johnny Walker
to go to California.

59:20.100 --> 59:22.011
- All right, I'll go.
- Really?

59:22.034 --> 59:23.672
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:00:06.367 --> 01:00:10.440
Hey, how you doing, Johnny?
Lew Landers, l.C.A.

01:00:10.467 --> 01:00:12.071
It's good to see you.
Welcome to California.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.841
We got a fine time
planned for you, buddy.

01:00:13.867 --> 01:00:16.006
Listen, Lew, I'm here
to meet the money man.

01:00:16.034 --> 01:00:17.445
I'm here on business,
not pleasure.

01:00:17.467 --> 01:00:19.310
I am the money man, Johnny.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.370
And I'll tell you something.
I'm gonna take you to meet...

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.970
the best quarterback
in the country...

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.502
a close personal friend
of mine.

01:00:24.534 --> 01:00:26.844
Give me five, Johnny.
Never touch.

01:00:45.534 --> 01:00:49.107
Jim McMahon wears Adidas.

01:01:00.134 --> 01:01:01.772
Either I wear Adidas...

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.302
or I wear nothing.

01:01:05.134 --> 01:01:06.943
Almost nothing.

01:01:06.967 --> 01:01:11.643
And cut!
Great. Beautiful. Amazing.

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.772
Here you go, Jim.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.677
I don't know how you do it,
Jimmy. Every time.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.678
Natural talent.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.611
Back to the golf course
again, huh?

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.772
- The rest of you--thank you.
- Just one more, Jim.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.110
- Hey, Yeoman, thanks a lot, man.
- You bet, boss.

01:01:23.133 --> 01:01:25.306
Thanks, Bob.

01:01:25.334 --> 01:01:28.941
Jimmy, how you doing?
Meet Johnny Walker.

01:01:28.967 --> 01:01:30.275
What's up, Jim?

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.779
How you doing, John?

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.212
Glad to see
you're coming to UCC.

01:01:34.234 --> 01:01:36.236
Well, I haven't really
made up my mind yet...

01:01:36.267 --> 01:01:39.146
but I'm damn glad
to meet you, man.

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:41.204
I'm having a little party
for my man tonight.

01:01:41.233 --> 01:01:42.769
Why don't you stop by
the house, huh?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.303
Well, I'd love to,
but I promised my wife...

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.940
I wouldn't show up
at your place anymore.

01:01:49.734 --> 01:01:52.237
What a kidder, huh?
I love you, Jimmy.

01:01:52.267 --> 01:01:54.440
Hey, maybe next time,
huh, babe?

01:01:55.733 --> 01:01:57.110
- Hey, Lew.
- Yeah?

01:01:57.134 --> 01:01:59.273
Did you notice how he had
his hair done up like that?

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.438
Yeah. Looks good.

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.276
Just like mine.
Like he planned it for me.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.938
Listen, let me tell you
something serious, huh?

01:02:03.967 --> 01:02:05.275
You play your cards right...

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.938
you could be the next
Adidas man someday.

01:02:06.967 --> 01:02:09.277
Lew, he had his hair hooked up
just like mine.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.770
1:45--Walker receives
jacket from Landers.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.972
Over and out.

01:02:19.667 --> 01:02:22.876
I know I may talk 90%
of the time, Johnny...

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.507
but, believe me,
I only take 10% of the action.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:29.344
- How you doing, Doc?
- Terrific, Lew, terrific.

01:02:32.367 --> 01:02:34.677
- Lewie.
- Yeah?

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.112
My mother's medicine cabinet
was never like this.

01:02:37.133 --> 01:02:40.342
Don't worry about it, Johnny.
You're not in Ashcroft anymore.

01:02:40.367 --> 01:02:42.973
We use only the finest
steroids available.

01:02:44.067 --> 01:02:47.105
We have only one mind-set
here at UCC...

01:02:47.134 --> 01:02:48.977
and that is that
our boys are winners.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.037
- Isn't that right, boys?
- Right!

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.946
I love these guys like my own
kids, and because of that...

01:02:53.967 --> 01:02:56.504
I take better care of them
than their own mommies do.

01:02:56.534 --> 01:02:59.208
- Isn't that right, boys?
- Right!

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.145
We have the best
training facilities...

01:03:01.167 --> 01:03:03.147
in the country, Johnny,
college or pro.

01:03:03.167 --> 01:03:04.475
Our men are appreciated...

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.878
for the fine pieces
of machinery that they are.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.675
- What's up, Slick?
- Hey.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.804
Does he play here?

01:03:09.834 --> 01:03:11.438
No, he just pisses
for the players...

01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:13.071
so they pass their drug tests.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.307
- A designated pisser, huh?
- Yeah.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:17.279
Let's get you some threads
for the party.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.506
All right.

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:19.773
Lew, how tall are you?

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.801
<i>About 5'8“.</i>

01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:47.040
Hi, I'm Tex Wade.
I'm looking for Johnny Walker.

01:03:47.067 --> 01:03:50.276
Oh. Well, he hasn't got
back from UCC yet.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.043
The hell's he doing at UCC?
Isn't he committed to OI' Tex?

01:03:54.067 --> 01:03:57.708
As far as I know, he hasn't
committed himself anywhere.

01:03:57.734 --> 01:04:01.614
Well, I hate to be the one
to enlighten you, Grandpa...

01:04:01.633 --> 01:04:03.544
but you did not get
that order...

01:04:03.567 --> 01:04:05.808
for them 10,000
walleyed gibblers...

01:04:05.834 --> 01:04:07.814
because they catch fish.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.709
What are you saying, mister?

01:04:11.734 --> 01:04:14.510
You figure it out, Grandpa.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.673
Ah, it's good to be home.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.338
Thanks, everybody. Thank you.

01:04:34.067 --> 01:04:35.273
Thank you.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.506
Hey, it's Johnny Walker.

01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:42.938
Thank you.

01:04:49.633 --> 01:04:51.271
This is a nice ride.
This is all right.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.280
Where'd you get it, anyway?
My dad got it for me.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.541
Kind of a graduation present
type thing.

01:04:55.567 --> 01:04:58.673
I thought I knew
your father hated you.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.271
Well, he used to,
but we're real tight now.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.371
Just kind of
woke up one morning...

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.313
we had breakfast, and now,
you know, real solid.

01:05:06.334 --> 01:05:07.711
Things are real good.

01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:11.112
I look cleaner than
the board of health, don't I?

01:05:11.134 --> 01:05:13.944
You kind of look like a combo--

01:05:13.967 --> 01:05:17.005
Liberace meets Prince's mom.
But it's groovy.

01:05:30.667 --> 01:05:32.203
Bye now.

01:05:36.434 --> 01:05:37.879
What's happening, Chief?

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.712
Where did you finally decide
to go to college, clown school?

01:05:41.734 --> 01:05:45.307
You know what you are, Chief?
You're an officer of love.

01:05:45.334 --> 01:05:47.177
Not of law-of love, you are.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.902
Do you dig it?

01:05:58.234 --> 01:05:59.508
It's a look.

01:06:28.634 --> 01:06:32.104
Mom, Mom,
Johnny's lost his mind!

01:06:42.267 --> 01:06:43.871
What do you think?

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.339
Mom, I got to tell you
about this school.

01:06:47.367 --> 01:06:51.747
UCC has a premed program--
absolutely blows OI' Tex away.

01:06:51.767 --> 01:06:54.543
Not even in the running anymore,
OI' Tex, because you know why?

01:06:54.567 --> 01:06:57.946
I'm gonna get about 3 times
the lab time I had at OI' Tex.

01:06:57.967 --> 01:07:01.176
Johnny,
what has happened to you?

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.373
Me? I'm great.
Don't I look great?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.607
I feel great, Mom. I really do.

01:07:05.634 --> 01:07:08.274
UCC is a football factory,
Johnny.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.302
Only about half the players
there even graduate.

01:07:10.334 --> 01:07:11.836
What about your education?

01:07:12.867 --> 01:07:14.608
Ma, education? Please, OK?

01:07:14.634 --> 01:07:16.978
Just, please,
step off with that, OK?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.206
I want to tell you something.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.975
I have a much better deal
here at UCC.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.343
They're working out
a sweeter deal...

01:07:21.367 --> 01:07:23.369
and they're gonna take
care of everything, guys.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.210
The way OI' Tex
took care of me?

01:07:28.533 --> 01:07:31.639
Come on, look, everyone
looks nauseous here now.

01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:34.773
I want to explain to you, OK?
UCC has a better deal for me.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.714
They're going to hook us up.
Mom, you'll have a bigger house.

01:07:38.734 --> 01:07:40.714
I don't want
a bigger house, Johnny.

01:07:40.734 --> 01:07:42.577
I want you to stop
thinking about yourself...

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.079
and start thinking about
what's right...

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.876
and about your family.
We're the people who love you...

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.107
or maybe you've been
too busy Lear-jetting around...

01:07:49.134 --> 01:07:50.272
to remember that.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.873
I mean, look at you.
Purple and gold?

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.402
You look ridiculous.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.104
I don't know how
this could've happened.

01:08:00.133 --> 01:08:03.808
Maybe it was just too important
a decision to leave up to you.

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:07.043
Hey, Mom, wait a second.
Mom, can we--

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.143
Come on, Gramps.
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:22.279
I wanted to sell my lures,
not my grandson.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.801
Come on.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.773
Gramp.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.143
Gramp.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.678
What do you think, Randy?
Come on, what's up?

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:43.671
I'm going to go do my homework
and take a reality break.

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:01.205
Johnny, I've had a deep,
revelatory vision...

01:09:01.234 --> 01:09:04.272
and I think you should drop this
ridiculous college ball thing.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.573
And do what?

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.809
Become a professional waiter.
Develop a reputation...

01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:11.404
as a bistro's
most courteous server.

01:09:11.434 --> 01:09:13.345
And, of course,
you're waiting for one night...

01:09:13.367 --> 01:09:15.210
when the manager's
relatives come in.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:18.010
You seat them. You serve them.
You wine them. You dine them.

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:19.911
You read them the specials.

01:09:19.934 --> 01:09:22.437
You take the last of their
orders, and then you say...

01:09:22.466 --> 01:09:26.005
"Actually, it's the fish
or nothing!"

01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:27.411
Of course, at this point...

01:09:27.434 --> 01:09:28.845
they're all jamming
for the door like wild.

01:09:28.867 --> 01:09:30.437
You tackle down around
the ankles.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.707
You get them down on the ground.
You pound them in the spine.

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.441
You say,
"Are you trying to stiff me...

01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:35.946
"on the gratuity, you fop?"

01:09:35.966 --> 01:09:37.207
Right.

01:09:37.234 --> 01:09:39.874
UCC is your only move

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:43.541
UCC is your evermost groove

01:09:43.567 --> 01:09:46.104
Excuse me.
We're new in town...

01:09:46.134 --> 01:09:48.511
and we've never had sex before.

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:50.411
Would you give us a hand?

01:09:51.634 --> 01:09:52.635
Up.

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:54.510
Don't follow the dames.

01:09:59.101 --> 01:10:02.048
Leo. Leo, turn--
I want to go home.

01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:04.274
I started dating
this Nancy girl...

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.474
specifically because
she was a virgin.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:11.243
Well, milliseconds before
initial penetration...

01:10:11.267 --> 01:10:15.306
I just shot up in bed
like a reverse domino...

01:10:15.334 --> 01:10:18.440
and I just said,
"Hey, there'll be none of this.

01:10:18.467 --> 01:10:20.208
"What kind of boy
do you think I am?

01:10:20.234 --> 01:10:22.874
"I will hardly pop you
without having met your father.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.811
"Get him on the horn."

01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:29.044
The things that make life worth
so much and so worthwhile...

01:10:29.067 --> 01:10:32.810
are things that we have to
look up at a lot of the time--

01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:35.144
it's clouds, it's stars...

01:10:35.167 --> 01:10:36.271
children.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.007
"By the way, where is the can?

01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:42.779
"I have to take an awful,
putrid asparagus piss."

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.541
He says, "Down the hall
to the left."

01:10:44.567 --> 01:10:47.013
That just really ticked me off,
so I got up and I said...

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:49.480
"Just a goddamn minute.
That won't do."

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.411
I run right up
to the family drapes...

01:10:51.434 --> 01:10:54.210
and proceed to write
my surname on them in urine.

01:10:54.234 --> 01:10:56.271
Well, Mom bolts out
of the La-Z-Boy chair...

01:10:56.301 --> 01:10:59.612
and comes over and delivers me
a flurry of slaps...

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:01.443
so I retaliate
with a series of blows...

01:11:01.467 --> 01:11:04.209
to her midriff and midsection
that I usually reserve...

01:11:04.234 --> 01:11:06.771
only for those times
when I actually do see red.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.609
I'm a winner.

01:11:08.634 --> 01:11:11.615
I am, and so all these
big money men...

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:14.012
they're offering me this,
this, this, and this, you know?

01:11:14.034 --> 01:11:17.140
Because I came home wearing,
like, heels and gold.

01:11:17.167 --> 01:11:20.580
My mother sat me down and she
told me what the deal was...

01:11:20.601 --> 01:11:23.309
you know, and spoke her mind,
and I've been acting crazy.

01:11:23.334 --> 01:11:24.472
I really have.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.208
Are you still conscious?

01:11:27.234 --> 01:11:28.736
She's talking. Good.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.302
Let her go. It's been an hour.

01:11:34.334 --> 01:11:37.838
Look, I seem to have
lockjaw of the arm.

01:11:43.001 --> 01:11:45.481
Love is a verb, and I wish...

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.242
I wish I'd just
get to it a lot more...

01:11:48.267 --> 01:11:50.804
because I feel good when I do.

01:11:50.834 --> 01:11:54.145
Say, are we going
to have sex or not?

01:12:04.034 --> 01:12:05.138
Rape!

01:12:05.167 --> 01:12:06.544
Rape!

01:12:09.834 --> 01:12:11.177
Put your top on!

01:12:13.334 --> 01:12:14.574
Freeze, assholes!

01:12:15.567 --> 01:12:18.343
- This is too good to be true.
- For who?

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:22.314
You're going
to the joint forever.

01:12:23.967 --> 01:12:26.004
What are you looking at,
weirdo?

01:12:26.034 --> 01:12:27.069
Ouch.

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.202
We got to get out of here.

01:12:34.534 --> 01:12:37.014
Look, Lew Landers
can get us out of here, right?

01:12:37.034 --> 01:12:41.881
- But then you got to go to UCC.
- Wait a minute.

01:12:41.901 --> 01:12:43.312
You know Lew Landers?

01:12:44.434 --> 01:12:46.778
Of course. You think my dad
bought me that Jeep?

01:12:46.801 --> 01:12:49.008
Are you kidding?
Lew Landers bought me the jeep.

01:12:49.034 --> 01:12:52.481
UCC got it for me to try to get
you to go to their school.

01:12:55.467 --> 01:12:58.744
- You set me up?
- No, I didn't set you up.

01:12:58.767 --> 01:13:00.474
I just pushed you
in a direction...

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.037
trying to do
the right thing for you.

01:13:03.067 --> 01:13:04.478
You set me up.
You didn't tell me.

01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:07.141
If I told you, you would've
said no, and then...

01:13:07.167 --> 01:13:08.703
well, then, it still wouldn't
have been setting you up.

01:13:08.734 --> 01:13:10.236
I just, you know...

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.311
I just made a mistake.

01:13:13.334 --> 01:13:15.143
I got...

01:13:17.467 --> 01:13:18.810
selfish.

01:13:21.267 --> 01:13:22.473
Me, too.

01:13:31.067 --> 01:13:33.843
Oh, this is terrible.
This is awful.

01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:36.143
This is really awful.

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:38.374
This is a serious mess.

01:13:38.401 --> 01:13:40.642
Does the phrase
"Bail us out immediately"...

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:41.907
mean anything to you?

01:13:41.934 --> 01:13:43.004
Bail?

01:13:44.334 --> 01:13:45.438
There's your bail.

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:48.448
That's your ticket
out of here right there.

01:13:48.467 --> 01:13:50.447
All he has to do
is sign with Fiermont--

01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:51.639
you're on the street.

01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:53.374
Otherwise, boys...

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.380
you're looking at twenty years
in the slammer...

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.038
with all the butt pirates.

01:13:57.067 --> 01:13:59.274
And they say they're waiting
for you up there, Johnny...

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:02.612
want to give you a little
hiney poke up there.

01:14:02.634 --> 01:14:04.443
Coach, I know I'm a man, OK?

01:14:04.467 --> 01:14:06.071
My asshole is exit only...

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.774
and we really didn't do
anything wrong.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.108
You want sympathy, Leo...

01:14:10.134 --> 01:14:13.775
you look between "shit" and
"syphilis" in the dictionary.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.076
No, no, you're gonna like it.
You're going to love it...

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:19.047
on the road gang, out there with
the cons cutting that grass.

01:14:19.067 --> 01:14:20.045
Oh, yeah.

01:14:20.067 --> 01:14:21.978
Boom. Boom.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.310
All the pretty girls will be
going by in convertibles...

01:14:24.334 --> 01:14:27.338
on spring break, drinking beer.

01:14:27.367 --> 01:14:30.780
They'll be waving at you.
"Hi, Johnny. Johnny!"

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.269
It's up to you, John.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.213
Put your foot
in the chain gang...

01:14:36.234 --> 01:14:38.942
or you can put your foot
in the cash register.

01:14:40.067 --> 01:14:42.343
You let me know.

01:14:44.334 --> 01:14:46.336
Don't drop the soap, boys.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.046
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gary DeLaune.

01:14:53.067 --> 01:14:55.047
Today, throughout the country,
hundreds of boys...

01:14:55.067 --> 01:14:57.138
will be signing their national
letters of intent.

01:14:57.167 --> 01:14:59.738
These letters are commitments
by high school seniors...

01:14:59.767 --> 01:15:01.576
to play for the college
of their choice.

01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:03.706
Today, there's no place
across the country...

01:15:03.734 --> 01:15:05.873
that has more media coverage
and more attention...

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.608
than right here--
Ashcroft High School.

01:15:07.634 --> 01:15:09.204
We're here at Ashcroft
High School.

01:15:09.234 --> 01:15:10.372
It's signing day.

01:15:10.401 --> 01:15:12.472
Now, Johnny Walker
has just arrived...

01:15:12.501 --> 01:15:14.481
to sign his national
letter of intent.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.275
In just a very few
short moments...

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.644
the entire country will know
where Johnny Walker...

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:21.341
has decided to play
his college football.

01:15:21.367 --> 01:15:24.473
Glad to see you boys could
be here for the announcement.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.776
I sure hope none of us
are disappointed.

01:15:26.801 --> 01:15:30.112
Something sure
don't smell right here.

01:15:33.401 --> 01:15:35.403
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

01:15:35.434 --> 01:15:38.938
I'm very happy to have been
asked, ladies and gentlemen...

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:41.106
to introduce Johnny Walker
here today.

01:15:41.134 --> 01:15:45.173
And I am so happy
to announce...

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.340
that John and I are going to be
together for another four years.

01:15:48.367 --> 01:15:51.371
I'm the new head coach
at Piermont University.

01:15:53.734 --> 01:15:55.805
But, you know, what really
makes me proud...

01:15:55.834 --> 01:15:58.007
is that John could've gone
anywhere in America...

01:15:58.034 --> 01:15:59.809
and he chose to be with me.

01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:01.074
Now, we've also landed...

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.513
four of the top blue-chip
prospects in this country...

01:16:04.534 --> 01:16:06.639
and they're all here today.
Come on up, fellas.

01:16:09.834 --> 01:16:11.973
You need a haircut.

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:13.503
All right.

01:16:15.334 --> 01:16:17.007
This is not about me.

01:16:17.034 --> 01:16:19.537
I'm only as good
as my players, believe me.

01:16:19.567 --> 01:16:21.046
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce...

01:16:21.067 --> 01:16:23.069
the man of the hour,
Johnny Walker.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.908
<i>'Iay! 'lay!</i>

01:16:41.934 --> 01:16:43.709
Throughout this recruitment...

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.744
I've acted like an idiot.

01:16:47.767 --> 01:16:50.008
I completely embarrassed
my mother...

01:16:50.034 --> 01:16:52.310
my family, my girlfriend...

01:16:52.334 --> 01:16:54.575
my friends.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.103
Mostly, I just
embarrassed myself...

01:16:59.367 --> 01:17:03.713
because I thought
I had something, and I lost it.

01:17:03.734 --> 01:17:07.511
And if this is what it takes
to play college football...

01:17:07.534 --> 01:17:11.311
then I don't even want
to play at all.

01:17:11.334 --> 01:17:16.841
Just because I know how
to remember to throw a ball...

01:17:16.867 --> 01:17:22.874
doesn't mean I should forget
my life or anyone else's.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.841
Therefore, I'm not going to sign
any letters to any schools.

01:17:27.867 --> 01:17:30.438
Now, that's reality.

01:17:30.467 --> 01:17:32.037
Thank you.

01:17:32.067 --> 01:17:34.707
You listen to me.
You are going to Piermont.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:37.180
- No, I'm not.
- If he doesn't go, I don't go.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.305
- I'm with him.
- Wait a minute, fellas.

01:17:39.334 --> 01:17:40.506
Hold on, fellas.

01:17:40.534 --> 01:17:42.707
Piermont University
will honor all its commitments.

01:17:42.734 --> 01:17:43.940
Now, I promise you that.

01:17:43.967 --> 01:17:46.174
Slight misunderstanding,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.440
Bear with us.

01:17:47.467 --> 01:17:48.468
Who are you?

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.537
My name is Floyd Gondole.

01:17:50.567 --> 01:17:53.571
I am the NCAA recruitment
investigator...

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.908
and I have followed...

01:17:54.934 --> 01:17:58.381
the recruitment of Johnny Walker
since day one...

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.609
and I am now calling
for a complete investigation...

01:18:01.634 --> 01:18:04.012
of UCC, OI' TeX...

01:18:04.034 --> 01:18:06.981
and, specifically, Piermont.

01:18:07.001 --> 01:18:08.378
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.643
You call framing a kid
for rape not wrong?

01:18:11.667 --> 01:18:13.613
You mean you framed
the kid for rape?

01:18:13.634 --> 01:18:15.580
You're both history.
You're both finished.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.635
Oh, this is ridiculous.

01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:18.510
Congratulations, John.
I'm proud of you.

01:18:18.534 --> 01:18:20.104
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is...

01:18:20.134 --> 01:18:21.807
You did good.
I'm proud of you.

01:18:21.834 --> 01:18:25.247
Hey, Johnny, I'm proud of you.
You did good, kid.

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.304
So, what are you going
to do now, huh?

01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:29.780
Penn State, Johnny!
Penn State! Penn State!

01:18:29.801 --> 01:18:32.213
Alabama! Remember the weather!

01:18:32.234 --> 01:18:34.407
Listen, Johnny, nobody--
and I mean nobody--

01:18:34.434 --> 01:18:36.141
makes a schmuck
out of me, capisce?

01:18:36.167 --> 01:18:37.544
Nobody has to, Lew.

01:18:37.567 --> 01:18:38.705
Is that right?

01:18:39.867 --> 01:18:41.471
You're going down now, Lew.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.502
Oh, you done made
a big mistake.

01:18:47.067 --> 01:18:48.671
No pictures!

01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:56.872
Title fight.
Hey, wish I could help.

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.472
Thank you, my friend.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.139
Good move, man.

01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:20.640
Let's get out of here.

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:25.212
Get back here, Walker!

01:19:25.234 --> 01:19:27.441
Get out of my way!
Walker, get back here!

01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:31.742
Get down, Gramp.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.212
Never did like that fella.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:49.146
Coach. Coach.

01:20:06.267 --> 01:20:07.337
Coach?

01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:12.169
I want an education.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.278
I saw the news conference
last night, Johnny.

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.837
Yeah?

01:20:22.134 --> 01:20:23.977
What'd you think?

01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:26.675
You showed
the type of character...

01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:28.772
that we like in our students.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.143
I like that.

01:20:31.567 --> 01:20:34.980
Does this mean...

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.002
you want me
to come play ball here?

01:20:40.567 --> 01:20:42.513
You bet I do.

01:21:55.567 --> 01:21:59.913
The Johnny Walker recruitment
scandal widened today...

01:21:59.934 --> 01:22:03.609
with the announcement
that UCC and OI' Tex...

01:22:03.634 --> 01:22:07.207
have each been placed
on one-year probation.

01:22:07.234 --> 01:22:09.236
Well, Joe Bob, thank God...

01:22:09.267 --> 01:22:11.713
basketball season's
right around the corner.

01:22:11.734 --> 01:22:13.839
Yeah, amen to that, Tex.

01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:17.474
You know, football ain't been
good to us this year at all.

01:22:22.967 --> 01:22:25.573
In a still further
development...

01:22:25.601 --> 01:22:30.346
Lew Landers has been barred
from participating...

01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:34.179
in the UCC football program
for life.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.840
You have one "F"?
We'll take care of it for you.

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.341
Hey, slow down for a minute!
I just want to talk to you!

01:22:40.434 --> 01:22:42.710
Lew Landers gave me that jeep!

01:22:55.567 --> 01:22:58.878
This is a pack of lies!
A pack of lies!

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:01.779
I know what I did.

01:23:01.801 --> 01:23:02.779
No, no.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.711
I hired a common idiot!

01:23:04.734 --> 01:23:06.077
A common idiot!

01:23:06.101 --> 01:23:07.341
Get the hell away from me!
