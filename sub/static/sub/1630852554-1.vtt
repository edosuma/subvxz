00:05.166 --> 00:07.133
GATES: I'm Henry
Louis Gates, Jr.

00:07.166 --> 00:09.266
Welcome to
"Finding Your Roots."

00:09.700 --> 00:11.066
In this episode,

00:11.100 --> 00:13.900
we'll meet television and
film producer Lee Daniels

00:14.633 --> 00:17.300
and actor/director Rebecca Hall.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.633
Two people whose lives
have been marked by

00:19.666 --> 00:21.766
deep family mysteries.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.633
HALL: I look at my mother...

00:23.666 --> 00:27.366
She didn't look like
everyone else's mother

00:27.933 --> 00:29.466
in the English countryside.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.976
DANIELS: There were
certain things we just

00:31.000 --> 00:32.100
didn't talk about.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.100
GATES: Right.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.209
DANIELS: And it's just
passed down from

00:34.233 --> 00:35.366
generation to generation.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.033
GATES: These silences.
DANIELS: Mmm-hmm.

00:37.066 --> 00:38.233
GATES: Yeah.

00:38.266 --> 00:40.466
DANIELS: Well the
silence stops with me.

00:40.700 --> 00:44.366
GATES: To uncover their roots,
we've used every tool available.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.233
Genealogists comb
through the paper trail

00:46.266 --> 00:48.033
their ancestors left behind,

00:48.066 --> 00:51.366
while DNA experts utilized
the latest advances in

00:51.400 --> 00:55.200
genetic analysis to reveal
secrets hundreds of years old.

00:56.066 --> 00:58.900
And we've compiled
everything into a book of life,

00:59.566 --> 01:01.766
a record of all of
our discoveries.

01:02.466 --> 01:05.600
HALL: How do you find these?

01:05.866 --> 01:08.000
DANIELS: No. No!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.133
GATES: And a window
into the hidden past.

01:11.166 --> 01:14.866
HALL: Didn't see this coming.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.333
Wow.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.333
DANIELS: Not only is
it a history lesson

01:18.366 --> 01:22.933
but it's personal.
It is, uh, powerful.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.966
Our people have
gone through so much.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.200
GATES: Lee and Rebecca grew up
in families where secrets and

01:30.233 --> 01:33.566
social conventions
obscured their ancestry

01:33.600 --> 01:35.533
behind thick veils.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.500
In this episode, we're
going to lift those veils and

01:39.533 --> 01:41.666
reconstruct their roots,

01:41.700 --> 01:44.433
revealing new aspects
of their identities,

01:44.466 --> 01:48.133
while shedding light on our
nation's complex racial past.

01:57.733 --> 02:03.833
(theme music plays)

02:19.366 --> 02:25.466
â™ª

02:31.500 --> 02:34.966
(overlapping chatter)

02:36.333 --> 02:38.966
GATES: Lee Daniels
is a true pioneer.

02:39.766 --> 02:42.400
The multi-talented
producer, screenwriter,

02:42.433 --> 02:46.466
and director has won
international fame in a career

02:46.500 --> 02:49.066
that's spanned more
than three decades.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.833
Along the way, he's
continually pushed boundaries,

02:53.866 --> 02:56.400
daring Hollywood to
be more inclusive,

02:56.433 --> 02:59.966
and leading the way via a
string of groundbreaking hits.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.166
From the hard-edged
social drama "Precious",

03:04.566 --> 03:09.166
to "Empire" the hip hop saga
of ambition, talent and greed.

03:10.366 --> 03:14.600
But to hear Lee tell it, all
he's really done is hold up

03:14.633 --> 03:18.333
a mirror to the people he
knows best: his family.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.266
DANIELS: I am them.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.933
My family is everything
that you see on screen.

03:25.700 --> 03:26.833
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

03:26.866 --> 03:28.733
DANIELS: I carry them proudly.

03:28.766 --> 03:33.933
The trauma, the pain,
the humor, the sexy.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.266
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.333
DANIELS: The everything
is celebrating them.

03:41.366 --> 03:44.333
GATES: As Lee readily
acknowledges trauma is at the

03:44.366 --> 03:48.766
heart of his work, the family
he so celebrates has not

03:48.800 --> 03:50.666
always treated him so well.

03:51.566 --> 03:54.233
Indeed his life has been
a constant process of

03:54.266 --> 03:57.000
adjustment and adaptation.

03:57.866 --> 04:00.800
Lee grew up in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

04:00.833 --> 04:03.733
in a home where his
father, William Daniels,

04:03.766 --> 04:08.133
a police officer, frequently
beat both Lee and his mother.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.900
The abuse only ended
when William was killed

04:12.933 --> 04:15.200
trying to stop a robbery.

04:16.066 --> 04:19.366
Lee was just 15 at the time,
but he's still wrestling

04:19.400 --> 04:22.166
with troubled
memories of his father.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.800
DANIELS: I went through a
period of just in awe of this

04:25.833 --> 04:32.466
man that was very literate who
wanted to be a lawyer but had

04:32.866 --> 04:36.166
to settle for being a cop
because he had children.

04:36.666 --> 04:37.933
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

04:37.966 --> 04:41.033
DANIELS: The books and the
literature that he had and the

04:41.066 --> 04:43.433
poems that he wrote.

04:43.466 --> 04:49.733
Uh, and his physical beauty,
all of it was just something

04:51.100 --> 04:53.600
that sticks out in my
head when I think of my dad.

04:53.633 --> 04:56.666
But he was abusive.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.633
Uh, and I'm trying to
understand, at 61, why?

05:01.666 --> 05:03.066
Why?

05:03.100 --> 05:07.300
Because I do believe that he was
still somebody else's child.

05:08.666 --> 05:11.566
GATES: Lee's questions may be
unanswerable but he knows

05:11.600 --> 05:15.133
full well why he's been
able to carry on even as

05:15.166 --> 05:17.266
those questions haunt him.

05:18.933 --> 05:21.133
In the wake of
his father's death,

05:21.166 --> 05:25.100
Lee's mother struggled to
raise him and ultimately made

05:25.133 --> 05:29.233
a decision that would
essentially reinvent them both.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.900
She told Lee that they were
going to use the address of a

05:32.933 --> 05:35.766
wealthy acquaintance and
pretend that they lived in the

05:35.800 --> 05:39.433
suburbs, so that Lee
could attend a better school.

05:40.566 --> 05:42.109
DANIELS: It really
changed the trajectory of

05:42.133 --> 05:43.333
who it is that I am.

05:43.366 --> 05:44.566
GATES: Right.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.442
DANIELS: Because I learned
how to navigate between an

05:46.466 --> 05:49.100
all-Black world and
an all-white world.

05:49.633 --> 05:55.166
So, I was able to seamlessly
go back and forth into, into

05:55.200 --> 05:57.200
blossoming into who I am.

05:57.666 --> 05:58.633
GATES: Did they
treat you well?

05:58.666 --> 06:00.500
DANIELS: Yeah, mmm-hmm.

06:00.533 --> 06:03.466
The only time I was not
treated well was when

06:03.500 --> 06:06.600
I auditioned for
"the sound of music" and

06:06.633 --> 06:09.600
I couldn't understand
why I couldn't play...

06:09.633 --> 06:11.200
GATES: Von Trapp...
DANIELS: The lead.

06:11.233 --> 06:12.433
GATES: Right.

06:12.466 --> 06:13.776
DANIELS: I was like
what is the problem?

06:13.800 --> 06:16.266
Because clearly that guy over
there ain't as good as I am.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.600
I know that for sure.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.266
I didn't understand.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.900
I think it was the first
time I really understood race.

06:21.933 --> 06:24.100
That I could not...

06:24.400 --> 06:25.676
The teacher was
looking at me like,

06:25.700 --> 06:27.140
how do we tell this
little Black boy?

06:27.166 --> 06:28.800
You know.

06:31.133 --> 06:34.466
GATES: My second guest is
renowned actor Rebecca Hall,

06:35.366 --> 06:38.233
who's given life to a slew
of memorable characters in

06:38.266 --> 06:42.666
a dizzying array of genres,
from classical theater to

06:42.700 --> 06:44.366
Hollywood blockbusters.

06:45.466 --> 06:48.266
Rebecca was born to be on stage.

06:48.300 --> 06:52.633
Her father was Sir Peter Hall,
the legendary founder of

06:52.666 --> 06:54.900
the Royal Shakespeare Company.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.900
Her mother, Maria Louise Ewing,

06:57.933 --> 07:02.166
was an international opera
star of the 1970s and 80s,

07:03.133 --> 07:05.333
and Rebecca grew up in London,

07:05.366 --> 07:07.466
the theater capital
of the world,

07:07.500 --> 07:09.666
knowing that she
wanted to follow in

07:09.700 --> 07:11.800
her parents footsteps.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.933
Did they try to dampen any
theatrical inclination

07:15.966 --> 07:17.033
that you had?

07:17.066 --> 07:18.700
HALL: No, they were
very accepting of it.

07:18.733 --> 07:24.233
They were very tolerant, but
I didn't really tell them

07:24.266 --> 07:25.400
too much about it.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.300
It was quite quiet
about it for a long time.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.366
I was like, yes.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.300
I knew I was going to
act forever and then

07:30.333 --> 07:31.633
I didn't talk about it.

07:31.666 --> 07:32.900
GATES: Yeah.

07:32.933 --> 07:35.042
But I could hear them now:
"she thinks we don't know."

07:35.066 --> 07:38.033
HALL: Yes. I think
that's definitely true.

07:38.933 --> 07:41.400
GATES: Rebecca's parents may
have been clear-eyed about

07:41.433 --> 07:44.300
her ambitions, but when
it came to helping her

07:44.333 --> 07:48.100
understand her ancestry, well,
that was another story.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.400
Her mother was an American,
born in Detroit, Michigan,

07:54.433 --> 07:57.366
but she left the states
behind to pursue her career,

07:57.400 --> 08:00.466
and Rebecca never
met her mother's father,

08:00.500 --> 08:02.333
her own grandfather,

08:02.366 --> 08:05.833
instead, she only
heard rumors about him.

08:05.866 --> 08:09.466
Rumors that raised questions
about his ethnicity.

08:10.966 --> 08:15.200
Those questions suddenly came
into focus when Rebecca read

08:15.233 --> 08:18.633
"Passing", a classic
American novel about an

08:18.666 --> 08:22.133
African American woman who
pretends that she's white.

08:23.966 --> 08:25.466
How did you discover the novel?

08:25.500 --> 08:31.133
HALL: I was talking
a lot to people

08:31.933 --> 08:34.800
about the fact that

08:34.833 --> 08:37.200
my mother intimated to
me that there was

08:37.233 --> 08:40.900
African American ancestry
and that her father was

08:40.933 --> 08:44.966
possibly Black,
possibly Native American.

08:45.666 --> 08:49.233
She wasn't entirely sure.

08:49.266 --> 08:51.600
And someone gave me
the book and said a lot of

08:51.633 --> 08:53.266
the things that
you're talking about,

08:53.300 --> 08:54.700
a lot of the things, you know,

08:54.733 --> 08:57.200
there was a term for
what you're describing.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.166
In your family and it
was called passing.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.900
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.933
HALL: I went, huh?

09:04.066 --> 09:10.766
And they said read this book,
and I read it and even though

09:11.166 --> 09:16.566
I don't know the facts of this
in my family and maybe you do

09:17.900 --> 09:22.800
but I had a sort of

09:25.066 --> 09:27.333
gut response to
the material that felt

09:27.366 --> 09:29.900
very powerful to me.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.633
GATES: Rebecca was so
taken by the novel that she

09:33.666 --> 09:35.766
adapted it into a film,

09:36.233 --> 09:39.066
all the while grappling
with how this material

09:39.100 --> 09:41.466
related to her own identity.

09:43.933 --> 09:47.033
GATES: Did you get grief
for being white or English?

09:49.166 --> 09:50.633
HALL: Yes.

09:50.666 --> 09:52.700
GATES: I mean I can't
believe that you didn't.

09:52.733 --> 09:53.800
HALL: Yeah.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.666
I mean when I was
pitching it to people and

09:55.700 --> 09:56.766
trying to get it made.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.033
Everyone would kind of
go, and then I'd say,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.766
well, look, when I
was growing up my mother would

10:04.800 --> 10:08.033
say things to me like,
well, you know we're Black.

10:08.066 --> 10:11.133
And then another day she'd
say I don't really know,

10:11.166 --> 10:12.366
and I'd say tell me more.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.466
What's the details of it?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.133
She said, well, I
don't really know.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.909
And the more I started to
think about it the more I

10:16.933 --> 10:21.566
started to understand that
while I have no experience of

10:21.600 --> 10:24.933
what it is to be a Black
person in America in my

10:24.966 --> 10:27.100
day-to-day walking
through the world,

10:27.133 --> 10:30.833
what I do have experience of
is being raised by people who

10:30.866 --> 10:33.233
were being raised
by people who did.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.133
And so, I suppose people
felt that my interest in it

10:37.166 --> 10:39.233
came honestly.

10:41.866 --> 10:45.233
GATES: My two guests come from
very different backgrounds.

10:45.266 --> 10:47.700
But as we began to
research their roots

10:47.733 --> 10:50.400
we found that their
family stories overlapped

10:50.433 --> 10:52.833
in very surprising ways

10:53.066 --> 10:56.600
revealing secrets that had
lain hidden for generations.

10:57.666 --> 11:00.633
It was time to bring
those secrets to light.

11:01.733 --> 11:04.900
We started with Rebecca, and
the questions that had swirled

11:04.933 --> 11:07.333
around her mother
since her childhood.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.500
HALL: I look at my mother...

11:10.533 --> 11:14.466
She was always very
extraordinarily beautiful,

11:14.866 --> 11:18.600
yes, but just she didn't
look like everyone else's

11:18.633 --> 11:21.933
mother in
the English countryside so,

11:22.333 --> 11:24.066
I think on some level
I was always kind of,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.533
fascinated in her, like,

11:26.566 --> 11:28.300
what what's going on here?

11:28.333 --> 11:30.633
GATES: So, how does
your mother self-identify?

11:30.666 --> 11:32.933
When she checks the
census she does she check,

11:32.966 --> 11:34.366
she would check white?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.500
HALL: Yeah.
GATES: Right.

11:38.233 --> 11:41.100
As we set out to untangle
her mother's identity,

11:41.133 --> 11:44.600
we focused on the man at
the center of all the confusion.

11:44.633 --> 11:48.100
Rebecca's maternal grandfather,
Norman Ewing.

11:49.466 --> 11:53.333
Norman, by all accounts,
was larger than life:

11:53.933 --> 11:57.366
a talented musician who gave
lectures and performances

11:57.400 --> 12:00.300
centered around his
Native American heritage.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.866
But Norman died in 1968,

12:03.900 --> 12:07.000
taking the details
of that heritage with him

12:07.033 --> 12:08.600
to the grave.

12:09.066 --> 12:12.600
Rebecca knew absolutely
nothing about his parents,

12:12.633 --> 12:15.766
much less his deeper roots.

12:15.800 --> 12:20.266
We uncovered a newspaper
article from the year 1926

12:21.133 --> 12:24.866
describing Norman's ties
to the Dakota-Sioux nation,

12:25.366 --> 12:29.166
ties that were far deeper
than Rebecca had imagined.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.666
HALL: "The Ithaca conservatory
of music is about to graduate

12:32.700 --> 12:34.566
its first American Indian.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.833
A hereditary chief
of the Sioux tribe,

12:37.866 --> 12:40.433
a descendant of warriors
who fought on the

12:40.466 --> 12:43.733
Custer battlefield,
he is Norman I. Ewing,

12:43.766 --> 12:46.633
born on the Fort Peck
Indian reservation at

12:46.666 --> 12:49.466
Poplar, Montana 30 years ago.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.833
He grew up amidst the tribal
customs and ceremonials

12:52.866 --> 12:54.500
of the Sioux.

12:54.533 --> 12:58.033
At 13, he was left alone by
the death of both parents and

12:58.066 --> 12:59.733
has since made his own way."

13:03.500 --> 13:04.933
Huh.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.233
GATES: Rebecca,
according to this article,

13:07.266 --> 13:09.800
your grandfather Norman
was a chief of the Dakota,

13:09.833 --> 13:12.933
one of the native
American tribes.

13:12.966 --> 13:15.233
Not only that, it
appears that his and if true,

13:15.266 --> 13:18.500
your ancestors fought in the
battle of Little Big Horn,

13:18.533 --> 13:21.000
also known as of
course Custer's last stand.

13:21.033 --> 13:24.333
Had you ever heard about this
experience for your grandfather?

13:24.366 --> 13:25.800
HALL: No, no.

13:25.833 --> 13:27.700
GATES: What do
you think of that?

13:27.733 --> 13:29.800
HALL: It's very surprising.

13:31.966 --> 13:34.800
GATES: We now set out to
verify Norman's story.

13:34.833 --> 13:38.100
According to this article,
he was born in Poplar, Montana,

13:39.366 --> 13:42.366
on what was known as the
Fort Peck Indian reservation.

13:43.733 --> 13:46.333
We found him there in 1916,

13:46.366 --> 13:49.933
marrying a Native American
woman named Maggie Culbertson.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.233
Maggie died in the 1920s,
and Norman began to travel the

13:54.266 --> 13:57.933
country soon after,
playing music and lecturing,

13:58.333 --> 14:02.266
until the late 1930s, when he
married Rebecca's grandmother

14:02.300 --> 14:04.166
and settled in Detroit.

14:04.866 --> 14:07.700
So far, the story checked out.

14:08.333 --> 14:12.166
But in the 1934 census for
the Fort Peck reservation,

14:12.200 --> 14:15.866
we saw something curious
next to Norman's name:

14:16.766 --> 14:19.566
the letters "N.E.",

14:19.600 --> 14:22.566
an abbreviation for
"not enrolled"

14:23.200 --> 14:26.300
which indicates that
Norman was not technically

14:26.333 --> 14:29.833
a member of the
Dakota Sioux nation.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.666
HALL: Wow.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.609
GATES: We talked to a scholar
about this who said that it

14:34.633 --> 14:37.033
was most likely because your
grandfather could not

14:37.066 --> 14:41.100
produce documentation or
witnesses to substantiate

14:41.133 --> 14:44.233
his claim to be a native person.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.100
Now, why would a tribal chief
have trouble proving

14:49.133 --> 14:53.866
that he was, in fact,
an indigenous person?

14:53.900 --> 14:55.466
HALL: Because he wasn't?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.500
GATES: Could you
please turn the page?

14:57.533 --> 14:59.100
HALL: Yes.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.333
GATES: Rebecca, this is
your grandfather's 1939

15:04.366 --> 15:06.733
application for Social Security.

15:06.766 --> 15:08.600
Would you please
read what it says?

15:10.833 --> 15:14.166
HALL: "Norman Isaac Ewing,
color or race, White.

15:14.733 --> 15:18.166
Date of birth, May 7, 1894.

15:19.100 --> 15:23.700
Place of birth,
Falls Church, VA."

15:24.433 --> 15:26.833
Virginia?

15:27.166 --> 15:30.333
GATES: This application shows
that Rebecca's grandfather was

15:30.366 --> 15:32.466
a white man born in Virginia,

15:32.500 --> 15:35.166
not a Native American
from Montana.

15:35.933 --> 15:39.300
It seemed like we solved our
mystery but we were wrong.

15:40.433 --> 15:43.466
Digging deeper, we
found census records,

15:43.500 --> 15:48.100
draft cards and other
documents that show Norman was

15:48.133 --> 15:51.933
willfully and
quite creatively inconsistent

15:51.966 --> 15:53.633
regarding his identity.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.466
Sometimes he listed
himself as white,

15:58.266 --> 16:00.433
sometimes as Native American,

16:01.133 --> 16:03.000
and his birthplace
varied as well.

16:04.200 --> 16:08.533
Desperate to find clarity,
we turned to Rebecca's DNA.

16:09.733 --> 16:12.900
We gave her an admixture test,
which reveals a person's

16:12.933 --> 16:16.766
ancestral heritage over
roughly the last 500 years.

16:18.700 --> 16:23.066
If her grandfather, in fact,
had Native American DNA,

16:23.100 --> 16:26.966
then Rebecca should
have inherited some of it.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.266
The moment of tRuth was at hand.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.733
You ready?

16:30.766 --> 16:32.766
HALL: Yes.
GATES: Please turn the page.

16:34.166 --> 16:36.166
Rebecca Hall, would you
please tell us how much

16:36.200 --> 16:39.800
Native American genetic ancestry
that you have in your genome?

16:40.366 --> 16:42.366
HALL: Um, none.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.800
GATES: None. Zero.

16:44.833 --> 16:45.900
HALL: Zero.

16:45.933 --> 16:48.766
Yes, there's a large
one pie with no pieces.

16:50.133 --> 16:53.800
GATES: So, it would appear,
at least according to your DNA,

16:53.833 --> 16:56.666
that your grandfather fabricated
the story of his origin.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.933
What's it like to see that?

17:00.866 --> 17:04.366
HALL: I sort of understand
taking on that identity

17:04.400 --> 17:08.800
because you married an
indigenous woman and

17:08.833 --> 17:11.766
that was your community.

17:12.633 --> 17:17.666
I don't entirely understand
how you could then become

17:17.700 --> 17:22.500
an expert and live it
so publicly like that.

17:23.066 --> 17:24.866
GATES: Mm-hmm.
HALL: Wow.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.966
GATES: There was, of course, a
question still in front of us:

17:32.133 --> 17:34.933
was Norman an African American?

17:35.833 --> 17:38.500
Rebecca had heard
stories that he was,

17:38.533 --> 17:40.433
and if those stories were true,

17:40.466 --> 17:43.666
they would explain,
at least in part,

17:43.700 --> 17:46.633
his decision to
hide his identity.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.533
We found our answer in the 1910
census for Washington, DC,

17:53.866 --> 17:56.200
where Norman and his
parents and siblings are

17:56.233 --> 17:58.466
listed as "mulattoes",

17:58.500 --> 18:02.500
meaning that they were
at least in part Black.

18:09.766 --> 18:11.833
HALL: It's just moving
to see it written down.

18:11.866 --> 18:13.300
GATES: Oh yeah.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.333
HALL: Because the
weight of that.

18:16.366 --> 18:19.766
GATES: Yes.

18:19.800 --> 18:25.466
HALL: I think, you know,
it's confirmed,

18:25.933 --> 18:28.166
I see something here.
I mean, it's not confirm...

18:28.200 --> 18:32.500
Sort of confirmed
what I've always suspected and

18:32.533 --> 18:35.000
yeah I just couldn't shake
the feeling that there was

18:35.033 --> 18:38.600
something being
hidden in my growing up.

18:40.700 --> 18:45.866
And honestly, it's a
tremendous relief to just

18:50.800 --> 18:53.033
get it out.

18:54.966 --> 18:58.766
GATES: Norman was 15 years old
when this census was recorded.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.666
At that time, American racial
relations were defined by

19:02.700 --> 19:04.833
Jim Crow segregation.

19:05.233 --> 19:08.800
Legally African Americans
were second class citizens,

19:09.400 --> 19:12.066
subjected to daily humiliations,

19:12.100 --> 19:15.266
and vulnerable to the
constant threat of violence.

19:16.366 --> 19:18.566
We believe that Norman
started listing himself as

19:18.600 --> 19:21.166
Native American around
the time he married

19:21.200 --> 19:24.166
his first wife in 1916.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.733
That decision now
seemed understandable.

19:27.766 --> 19:31.633
Embracing the myth of having
noble Native American ancestry

19:31.666 --> 19:35.400
was a way for Norman to
break free of the anti-Black

19:35.433 --> 19:37.933
racism that surrounded him.

19:38.866 --> 19:40.609
Does knowing this make you
think of your grandfather,

19:40.633 --> 19:44.200
and your identity differently?

19:45.500 --> 19:48.966
HALL: I mean I knew
this on some level,

19:49.000 --> 19:55.466
and I'm still grappling with
what that means for who I am.

19:56.633 --> 19:57.966
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.533
HALL: But I do think of
my success in the world,

20:04.066 --> 20:08.000
my existence in the world,
on some level being

20:08.033 --> 20:09.833
dependent on this choice.

20:09.866 --> 20:12.166
GATES: Hmm.

20:12.666 --> 20:14.366
HALL: And that's complicated.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.966
GATES: That's
very complicated.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.333
It enabled a set of
possibilities that resulted in

20:21.366 --> 20:26.500
choices your mom could make,
which would have been closed

20:26.533 --> 20:28.600
to her otherwise,
without a doubt.

20:29.366 --> 20:30.700
HALL: Without a doubt.

20:30.733 --> 20:32.466
GATES: Yeah.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.300
Much like Rebecca, Lee Daniels
was about to uncover a once

20:38.333 --> 20:42.466
scandalous story now
buried within his family tree.

20:43.433 --> 20:46.966
It begins with his paternal
grandfather-Otis Daniels,

20:47.800 --> 20:50.566
who helped to raise Lee
him and bring a measure of

20:50.600 --> 20:54.033
happiness to a very
troubled childhood.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
DANIELS: He was a
passive, wonderful man.

20:56.533 --> 21:00.333
I think he had
eight or nine kids.

21:00.366 --> 21:03.300
He did many jobs.

21:03.333 --> 21:06.966
He was a manager of a gas
station to a manager of a

21:07.000 --> 21:10.700
cinema house, movie theater.

21:12.633 --> 21:18.333
Um, just salt of the earth,
great lemonade maker.

21:19.866 --> 21:24.933
Um, beautiful man
that I miss very much.

21:26.466 --> 21:29.333
GATES: Clearly Lee
loved his grandfather,

21:29.366 --> 21:32.600
but he knew almost
nothing about Otis's roots.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.133
And as we started our research,

21:36.166 --> 21:38.700
we began to understand why.

21:39.233 --> 21:42.400
In the 1930 census for
Durham, North Carolina,

21:42.433 --> 21:45.300
we found Otis and his
mother Ada living in

21:45.333 --> 21:47.500
a very unusual household.

21:49.533 --> 21:53.566
DANIELS: "Laura Hunter,
head of household. Age, 35.

21:54.233 --> 21:56.500
Widow.
Occupation, maid at hotel.

21:56.533 --> 22:00.033
Ada Daniels, mother.
Age 49. Widow.

22:00.066 --> 22:02.733
Occupation, worker at factory.

22:03.033 --> 22:05.500
Otis Daniels, brother.
Age, 17."

22:05.533 --> 22:06.566
What is that?

22:06.600 --> 22:08.733
GATES: That's Otis
at the age of 17.

22:08.766 --> 22:10.409
DANIELS: This is my grandfather?
GATES: Mm-hmm.

22:10.433 --> 22:13.200
With his mother, your
great-grandmother, Ada Daniels,

22:13.233 --> 22:16.433
living in the household
of Otis's older sister.

22:17.066 --> 22:18.400
DANIELS: Otis's older sister.

22:18.433 --> 22:21.033
GATES: Yep, and her
name was Laura Hunter.

22:21.066 --> 22:22.500
Okay. You with me?

22:22.533 --> 22:23.733
DANIELS: Yep.

22:23.766 --> 22:26.400
GATES: Does anything on that
census strike you as odd?

22:26.433 --> 22:28.866
DANIELS: Why isn't she
living with her husband?

22:29.400 --> 22:32.133
GATES: Lee's question gets to
the heart of mystery:

22:32.166 --> 22:34.966
where was Ada's husband,
Otis' father?

22:36.733 --> 22:39.266
We could find no
records to guide us.

22:40.633 --> 22:43.900
Otis' marriage license,
filed in 1940,

22:44.500 --> 22:48.400
lists his father as a
man named "William Daniels",

22:48.433 --> 22:50.800
and indicates that
William was deceased.

22:51.733 --> 22:54.500
But our search for
William went nowhere.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.809
GATES: Have you ever heard
this name or heard anything

22:56.833 --> 22:57.900
about William Daniels?

22:57.933 --> 22:59.300
DANIELS: Uh-uh.
GATES: Okay.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.342
Well, Lee, we spent hours
researching this and we found

23:01.366 --> 23:05.466
no evidence whatsoever of a
man named William Daniels that

23:05.500 --> 23:07.233
he ever existed.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.066
DANIELS: That's interesting.
GATES: So, we turned to DNA.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.133
DANIELS: Okay.

23:11.166 --> 23:13.600
GATES: And when we
analyzed your DNA we found

23:13.633 --> 23:16.166
that you have a number of
matches who connect to you

23:16.200 --> 23:17.833
through one man.

23:17.866 --> 23:20.400
And that man is Otis's father.

23:21.333 --> 23:25.500
That man, we discovered
just using DNA analysis.

23:26.366 --> 23:29.233
He is your great-grandfather.

23:29.266 --> 23:30.300
You want to meet him?

23:30.333 --> 23:32.666
DANIELS: Yeah.
GATES: Please turn the page.

23:34.433 --> 23:36.733
DANIELS: No! No!

23:38.433 --> 23:42.266
GATES: Lee shares DNA with a
network of people all tied to

23:42.300 --> 23:44.133
a man named Rufus Hunter.

23:45.033 --> 23:47.766
This was shocking because
Rufus was the husband of

23:47.800 --> 23:50.533
Otis's older
sister Laura Hunter,

23:51.466 --> 23:54.533
and the father of
Otis' niece, Ruth.

23:55.233 --> 23:58.433
So Rufus had children
with both Ada Daniels

24:00.033 --> 24:02.433
and with her daughter Laura,

24:02.766 --> 24:05.233
and they all lived
in the same house!

24:07.133 --> 24:10.766
DANIELS: This is a gag.
This is outrageous.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.300
GATES: It is
stunningly surprising.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.100
DANIELS: Mmm-hmm.

24:16.133 --> 24:17.600
GATES: Now, you
grew up knowing Ruth.

24:17.633 --> 24:18.633
You called her Aunt Ruth.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.900
DANIELS: I did.

24:19.933 --> 24:21.542
GATES: Did she ever share
anything about her father's

24:21.566 --> 24:23.666
relationship with either
her mother Laura or

24:23.700 --> 24:24.800
your great-grandmother Ada?

24:24.833 --> 24:26.166
DANIELS: No. None of it.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.742
GATES: Do you think that
your grandfather knew

24:27.766 --> 24:29.466
the identity of his father?

24:29.500 --> 24:32.900
After all, he grew up
in Rufus's household.

24:33.233 --> 24:34.709
DANIELS: There were certain
things we just didn't talk

24:34.733 --> 24:38.333
about with our
grandparents and my father,

24:38.600 --> 24:42.400
I could plug my mother for a
little bit but I could never,

24:42.433 --> 24:44.533
there were certain things
you just didn't,

24:44.566 --> 24:45.909
if they didn't
want to talk about it...

24:45.933 --> 24:47.933
GATES: Right.
DANIELS: It wasn't talked about.

24:48.233 --> 24:50.300
GATES: Has anything
that we've discussed changed

24:50.333 --> 24:52.933
anything about the
way you think of your father,

24:52.966 --> 24:55.833
about who he was or how
he became who he was?

24:56.766 --> 25:00.500
DANIELS: It explains why
he would never give me

25:00.533 --> 25:02.666
information about
my grandfather.

25:03.033 --> 25:05.100
Though my grandfather
was really loving,

25:05.133 --> 25:07.076
why my grandfather would
never give me information

25:07.100 --> 25:08.800
about his father.

25:08.833 --> 25:10.366
GATES: Right.
DANIELS: You know?

25:10.400 --> 25:11.866
GATES: Yeah.

25:11.900 --> 25:14.242
DANIELS: It's just passed down
from generation to generation

25:14.266 --> 25:16.566
from one Black man
to the next Black man

25:16.600 --> 25:17.966
to the next Black man.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.066
GATES: These silences.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.266
DANIELS: Mm-hmm.
GATES: Yeah.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.300
DANIELS: Well, the
silence stops with me,

25:22.533 --> 25:24.166
which is a good thing.

25:25.466 --> 25:27.966
GATES: Now that we'd
identified Otis parents,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.966
we could go further on this
branch of Lee's family tree.

25:32.766 --> 25:35.433
Otis' grandfather, Lee's
great-great-grandfather,

25:36.200 --> 25:38.366
was a man named "Novel Daniel".

25:39.033 --> 25:42.833
Novel was born into
slavery sometime around 1800,

25:43.666 --> 25:46.200
likely in Wake County,
North Carolina.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.800
Searching for
evidence of his life,

25:48.833 --> 25:53.200
we noticed that in 1850, a
white resident of Wake County

25:53.233 --> 25:57.600
named "Zadock Daniel" filed a
slave schedule indicating that

25:57.633 --> 26:00.266
he owned ten human beings,

26:00.633 --> 26:04.166
we wondered if Novel
might be one of them.

26:04.566 --> 26:08.900
So, he would have been between
about 45 and 55 years old in

26:08.933 --> 26:11.466
that year 1850.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.166
So, read those slaves again.

26:14.566 --> 26:18.600
DANIELS: 45, 40, and 39.

26:18.633 --> 26:21.333
GATES: Lee, we believe that
it's very likely that one of

26:21.366 --> 26:25.566
these male slaves is your
great-great-grandfather and

26:25.600 --> 26:29.066
that he was owned
by Zadock Daniel.

26:32.033 --> 26:34.466
DANIELS: Fascinating.

26:34.666 --> 26:36.766
GATES: And think
about this, if your

26:36.800 --> 26:39.900
great-great-grandfather Novel
was indeed Zadock's slave it

26:39.933 --> 26:43.200
would mean that you carry the
last name of the white man who

26:43.233 --> 26:46.366
held your ancestor in bondage.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.300
Have you given much thought to
the origins of your last name?

26:50.333 --> 26:51.842
DANIELS: No, I was
looking forward to this.

26:51.866 --> 26:54.566
I've been looking forward
to this for quite some time

26:54.600 --> 26:58.166
and this is blowing my mind.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.800
GATES: This record lists
Zadock Daniel's

27:02.833 --> 27:06.900
enslaved human beings by age,
sex and color,

27:07.933 --> 27:09.733
but not by name.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.300
So, on its own, we can't
be certain that one of these

27:13.333 --> 27:16.400
marks actually
represents Lee's ancestor.

27:17.966 --> 27:20.633
But we soon found something
that erased all doubts:

27:21.400 --> 27:24.600
Zadock Daniel's will, in
which he enumerates his

27:24.633 --> 27:26.833
human property by name.

27:28.966 --> 27:31.500
DANIELS: "to my
beloved wife, Martha,

27:31.533 --> 27:34.333
and my three children by her,
Sarah B. Coakley,

27:35.233 --> 27:38.966
Henderson l. Daniels,
and Thomas P. Daniels,

27:39.600 --> 27:42.200
to be divided in
the following manner:

27:42.666 --> 27:44.500
three, mmm...

27:45.000 --> 27:49.266
Three negroes, Novel,
Harriet, and her child John,

27:50.166 --> 27:53.833
two horses, her choice,
three cows and calves and

27:53.866 --> 27:58.200
two younger cattle, her choice,
three sows and pigs and

27:58.233 --> 28:00.766
as many young hogs to make

28:00.800 --> 28:04.066
a sufficiency
of pork for her family."

28:04.566 --> 28:07.866
Just that we are
able to be, you know,

28:07.900 --> 28:12.566
that Black people were
talked about with the same,

28:16.133 --> 28:18.800
in the same, with the same

28:18.833 --> 28:23.300
with cows
and calves is disturbing.

28:24.533 --> 28:26.166
GATES: It's horrible.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.466
DANIELS: It's disturbing.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.376
GATES: And they didn't even
think about it because they

28:29.400 --> 28:32.033
were property just
like, and you read it,

28:32.066 --> 28:35.333
the two horses,
three cows and calves.

28:35.366 --> 28:37.100
DANIELS: Three sows and a pig.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.633
GATES: Sows and pigs
and as many young hogs.

28:39.666 --> 28:41.666
Oh, yeah, and three negroes.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.500
Novel, boom.

28:44.133 --> 28:47.500
So, you now know where the
name Daniel came from and

28:47.533 --> 28:50.266
you know who owned,
the white man,

28:50.300 --> 28:52.866
who owned your
ancestors in slavery.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.833
Zadock Daniel.

28:56.100 --> 29:00.833
DANIELS: It's, uh,
it's disturbing. Sad.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.166
GATES: Novel's story
doesn't end here.

29:08.200 --> 29:11.166
He survived slavery,
and started a family.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.233
But like so many African
Americans of his generation,

29:14.266 --> 29:18.400
he was unable to accrue any
wealth in the Jim Crow south.

29:19.766 --> 29:23.400
He died a farmer, almost
certainly a sharecropper,

29:23.866 --> 29:26.900
likely in the same part of
North Carolina where he had

29:26.933 --> 29:29.566
spent decades in slavery.

29:31.033 --> 29:34.866
Novel Daniels is also the
oldest ancestor we could

29:34.900 --> 29:37.633
identify on this branch
of Lee's family tree.

29:39.300 --> 29:42.933
Beyond him we
could go no further.

29:42.966 --> 29:46.466
Surveying how far we'd come,
Lee found himself wondering

29:46.500 --> 29:49.900
how so much of his
history had been obscured,

29:49.933 --> 29:52.133
or willfully forgotten.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.833
DANIELS: I don't
know why Black people,

29:54.866 --> 29:59.166
why we kept
information to ourselves.

29:59.833 --> 30:00.900
GATES: Pain?

30:00.933 --> 30:03.966
DANIELS: I think, some of it.
GATES: Right.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.800
DANIELS: Embarrassment maybe.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.800
GATES: Embarrassment, I agree.

30:07.833 --> 30:10.433
If you say it out
loud it makes it worse.

30:10.466 --> 30:13.466
If I don't say it,
it'll go away and of course

30:13.500 --> 30:15.233
it never goes away.

30:15.266 --> 30:16.966
DANIELS: No.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.633
GATES: We'd already reveled
how Rebecca Hall's grandfather,

30:21.666 --> 30:26.000
Norman Ewing, concealed his
African American heritage

30:26.033 --> 30:29.800
in an attempt to escape the
racism of Jim Crow America.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.866
Now we turned our
attention to Norman's father,

30:33.900 --> 30:37.966
Rebecca's great-grandfather,
a man named John Ewing.

30:38.800 --> 30:43.266
John was born into
slavery in Tennessee in 1858,

30:43.300 --> 30:46.666
meaning he was roughly seven
years old when freedom came.

30:47.633 --> 30:50.500
It was a time when many Black
people were struggling

30:50.533 --> 30:52.900
simply to survive.

30:52.933 --> 30:55.700
And since his son Norman
chose to disguise

30:55.733 --> 30:58.066
his African American ancestry,

30:58.100 --> 31:02.133
I suspected that John's
life was severely limited

31:02.166 --> 31:05.366
by those struggles too,
but I was mistaken.

31:06.266 --> 31:07.900
John's obituary,

31:07.933 --> 31:11.600
published in a Washington, DC
newspaper in 1911,

31:12.166 --> 31:14.666
is a litany of
startling accomplishments.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.500
HALL: "He came to the city in
the fall of 1872 as a result

31:19.533 --> 31:21.900
of a desire to see
the national capitol.

31:21.933 --> 31:25.300
Here he met President Grant,
Frederick Douglass,

31:25.333 --> 31:28.733
John M. Langston,
and Horace Maynard,

31:29.233 --> 31:32.266
who took a great interest
in him and secured for him

31:32.300 --> 31:34.833
a position in the United
States Treasury Department,

31:34.866 --> 31:36.733
which enabled him to enter

31:36.766 --> 31:40.133
Howard University
Preparatory Department.

31:40.166 --> 31:44.300
Here he continued until the
spring of 1875 when he went to

31:44.333 --> 31:47.000
Constantinople with
Mr. Horace Maynard,

31:47.033 --> 31:50.733
who had been appointed United
States minister to Turkey.

31:50.766 --> 31:52.600
Mr. Ewing was always
interested in anything

31:52.633 --> 31:54.700
looking to the elevation
of the race along

31:54.733 --> 31:57.066
moral and educational lines."

31:57.100 --> 32:02.833
Gosh. Excuse me. What?

32:03.266 --> 32:04.433
GATES: Yes.

32:04.466 --> 32:08.933
And all of that is true,
unlike the stories that

32:08.966 --> 32:11.000
your grandfather confected.

32:11.033 --> 32:12.133
HALL: Oh, my goodness.

32:12.166 --> 32:13.266
GATES: Yes.

32:13.300 --> 32:15.633
This is the heritage
your grandfather was

32:15.666 --> 32:17.100
walking away from.

32:17.133 --> 32:20.000
HALL: Oh, my, oh.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.533
(stammering)

32:24.000 --> 32:26.533
I don't really have any words.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.566
GATES: We don't
how he did it, but,

32:29.600 --> 32:33.100
for a time, Rebecca's ancestor
was one of the most prominent

32:33.133 --> 32:35.900
African Americans in Washington

32:35.933 --> 32:37.766
working for the
federal government,

32:37.800 --> 32:41.300
interacting with
politicians and ambassadors,

32:41.333 --> 32:43.966
and becoming a friend of
Frederick Douglass.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.800
One the greatest minds this
country has ever produced and

32:47.833 --> 32:52.233
the most famous Black man
of the entire 19th century.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.733
HALL: I mean, these are
people I've read about...

32:55.766 --> 32:57.309
GATES: Yes, of course.
HALL: I've ready about,

32:57.333 --> 33:01.633
obviously I have but
it's truly mind-blowing.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.966
GATES: Your great-grandfather
was a big deal.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.133
HALL: He was. He was.

33:08.166 --> 33:11.133
I'm glad that we can
celebrate him a little bit.

33:11.166 --> 33:12.433
GATES: Yeah.

33:12.466 --> 33:13.542
I want to show
you one more thing.

33:13.566 --> 33:15.633
Could you please turn the page?

33:17.266 --> 33:18.800
HALL: What?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.566
GATES: That's your
great-grandfather.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.300
That's John William Ewing.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.466
HALL: He was dashing, huh?

33:27.500 --> 33:28.700
GATES: He was dashing.

33:28.733 --> 33:30.700
He was brilliant
and he was dashing.

33:30.733 --> 33:32.733
HALL: Wow.

33:35.533 --> 33:38.300
GATES: We now
faced a new question.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.166
In the 1910 census,

33:40.200 --> 33:43.233
John Ewing is listed
as being a mulatto,

33:43.266 --> 33:46.166
meaning he likely had
recent white ancestry.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.066
We were curious about
where it came from.

33:49.100 --> 33:52.500
We knew that John's
mother, Violet Ewing,

33:53.466 --> 33:56.266
was born around
1832 in Virginia.

33:57.266 --> 33:59.933
But that's as far as the
paper trail could take us.

34:00.733 --> 34:03.766
Then we noticed
something in Rebecca's DNA.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.833
She has multiple matches with
people who can all

34:06.866 --> 34:09.600
trace their ancestry
back to one couple.

34:10.266 --> 34:13.233
Samuel and Mary Ewing.

34:13.266 --> 34:15.966
They were both born in
Virginia in the 1780s,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.133
and they were white.

34:18.166 --> 34:22.233
What's more, they had relatives
who owned slaves,

34:22.266 --> 34:25.066
including relatives
living in Tennessee,

34:25.100 --> 34:27.166
where John was born.

34:27.200 --> 34:29.300
So while we can't be certain,

34:29.333 --> 34:31.533
we now had a compelling theory.

34:32.933 --> 34:34.976
We think it's possible that
Violet was enslaved by the

34:35.000 --> 34:38.866
Ewing family in
Virginia and she was moved,

34:38.900 --> 34:42.266
quite possibly while
still pregnant to the

34:42.300 --> 34:44.733
Lincoln County, Tennessee
area where members of the

34:44.766 --> 34:48.700
extended Ewing family had been
residing since the early-1800s,

34:50.200 --> 34:53.266
which is why your family
traces back to Tennessee.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.666
So, think about
this, if we're right,

34:55.700 --> 34:58.033
in 1860 your great-great-
grandmother Violet was

34:58.066 --> 35:02.900
enslaved by the cousin of the
man who had impregnated her.

35:05.466 --> 35:08.300
What's it like to learn this?

35:09.333 --> 35:10.766
HALL: It's so sad.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.366
GATES: Incredibly sad.

35:14.333 --> 35:19.766
HALL: I find it very very sad
and I find it very moving that

35:20.833 --> 35:24.200
you know that my mother,

35:24.500 --> 35:29.900
that her sisters they
don't really have full access

35:30.400 --> 35:32.733
to this and yet
they carry that name.

35:32.766 --> 35:35.266
GATES: Mmm-hmm, yes.

35:37.966 --> 35:42.333
HALL: And the history of that
and everything that in it.

35:45.466 --> 35:47.800
It deserves to be known I think.

35:50.433 --> 35:52.100
GATES: We were not yet
done with Rebecca's

35:52.133 --> 35:54.766
African American roots,
not by a long shot.

35:56.566 --> 36:00.033
John Ewing's wife,
Rebecca's great-grandmother,

36:00.066 --> 36:02.900
was a woman named
Harriet Norman.

36:02.933 --> 36:07.200
Harriet was born around
1864, likely in Ohio,

36:08.566 --> 36:11.566
and she descends from a long
line of free Black people,

36:12.566 --> 36:16.700
including, a man who
was born around 1760,

36:17.066 --> 36:20.533
in what was then the
British colony of Maryland.

36:21.333 --> 36:24.400
It's highly unusual for a
Black person to able to

36:24.433 --> 36:28.666
identify an ancestor
from this era by name.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.000
HALL: Bazabeel "Basil" Norman.

36:33.033 --> 36:35.066
GATES: Bazabeel
"Basil" Norman.

36:35.100 --> 36:39.600
You have just met your
fourth-great-grandfather.

36:41.066 --> 36:45.233
Your great-great-great-
great-grandfather.

36:46.933 --> 36:49.633
HALL: Yeah, i...

36:49.666 --> 36:51.442
GATES: Can you believe
we've taken your mother's

36:51.466 --> 36:52.866
family tree back this far?

36:52.900 --> 36:58.600
HALL: No, I can't believe
that you have done this,

36:58.633 --> 37:00.366
found all this information.

37:00.400 --> 37:05.466
It's just truly,
truly remarkable.

37:09.533 --> 37:11.800
And I understand how rare it is.

37:11.833 --> 37:14.500
GATES: It is
exceptionally rare,

37:14.533 --> 37:16.633
but I want to tell you
one little thing about

37:16.666 --> 37:19.833
good old fourth-great-
grandfather Bazabeel.

37:20.233 --> 37:21.366
HALL: Yeah. Please do.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.966
GATES: Could you
please turn the page?

37:24.066 --> 37:27.900
Rebecca, that
document was written in 1818.

37:28.766 --> 37:31.033
So, it was recorded
more than 200 years ago.

37:32.133 --> 37:34.000
Would you please read
the transcribed section?

37:36.333 --> 37:38.833
HALL: "Bazabeel Norman of the
township of Roxbury,

37:38.866 --> 37:41.666
County of Washington
and State of Ohio,

37:41.700 --> 37:45.400
I enlisted in the
fall of the year 1777

37:45.433 --> 37:49.300
into the company commanded
by Captain Richard Anderson

37:49.333 --> 37:52.500
as a private soldier
and in the 7th regiment

37:52.533 --> 37:55.866
commanded by Colonel John Gunby
in the Maryland line and

37:55.900 --> 37:58.800
served my country against
the common enemy until the close

37:58.833 --> 38:01.433
of the war on the continental
establishment when I was

38:01.466 --> 38:04.200
discharged under
a general order."

38:04.233 --> 38:05.966
GATES: Do you know
what that means?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.933
HALL: I think I do but
I want you to tell me.

38:07.966 --> 38:09.709
GATES: Rebecca, your
fourth-great-grandfather

38:09.733 --> 38:11.600
fought in the
American Revolution.

38:11.633 --> 38:13.600
HALL: Yeah.
That's what I thought.

38:13.633 --> 38:16.133
GATES: He was a patriot.

38:17.533 --> 38:21.266
Now, when you were a school girl
studying about the rebellion

38:21.300 --> 38:25.000
of the colonies did you ever
think you had an ancestor,

38:25.033 --> 38:27.433
a, who fought
with the patriots and

38:27.466 --> 38:29.433
b, that he was Black?

38:29.466 --> 38:31.700
HALL: No.
No, I did not.

38:34.900 --> 38:38.300
GATES: Scholars estimate that
roughly 5,000 people of color

38:38.333 --> 38:41.066
fought for our
nation's independence.

38:41.833 --> 38:44.100
And Rebecca's 4th
great-grandfather was

38:44.133 --> 38:47.200
one of them,
often on the front lines!

38:48.133 --> 38:51.100
He served in the 7th Maryland
regiment of the continental

38:51.133 --> 38:54.433
army, which fought up and
down the eastern seaboard,

38:54.900 --> 38:57.200
in a number of notable battles,

38:57.233 --> 39:00.133
including the famed
patriot victory at

39:00.166 --> 39:02.533
Cowpens, South Carolina.

39:02.733 --> 39:04.766
It was some of the
most intense combat of

39:04.800 --> 39:06.700
the entire war,

39:06.733 --> 39:09.933
and Bazabeel was compensated
for his courage by the

39:09.966 --> 39:13.566
federal government
with a land grant in Ohio.

39:16.233 --> 39:19.200
You are looking at
your family's land.

39:21.666 --> 39:25.766
That is the very land that
Bazabeel settled in 1820

39:26.433 --> 39:30.700
as a reward for
his heroic service during

39:30.733 --> 39:32.400
the American Revolution.

39:32.433 --> 39:34.400
HALL: Oh. Wow.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.300
GATES: You have an
extraordinarily detailed

39:44.333 --> 39:47.533
paper trail for a person
of African descent.

39:47.766 --> 39:48.766
HALL: Yeah.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.766
GATES: And you, my dear,
are indeed a person

39:50.800 --> 39:53.200
of African descent.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.733
HALL: I'm very
moved, obviously.

40:03.466 --> 40:05.766
GATES: We had already explored
Lee Daniels' father's

40:05.800 --> 40:09.233
family tree, untangling
the secrets of his

40:09.266 --> 40:11.266
grandfather's parentage.

40:11.733 --> 40:13.800
Now, turning to
Lee's mother's roots,

40:13.833 --> 40:16.833
we traced back two generations
to his great-grandparents,

40:18.166 --> 40:21.733
Edward and Mary Watson, and
encountered a very different

40:21.766 --> 40:23.366
kind of secret.

40:26.366 --> 40:28.576
Now, I understand that there's
a family story about them.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.533
DANIELS: Yes.

40:29.566 --> 40:30.900
GATES: Can you
tell me about this?

40:30.933 --> 40:32.500
What you've heard.

40:32.533 --> 40:34.209
DANIELS: I don't know
whether it's a rumor or

40:34.233 --> 40:35.800
how accurate it is.

40:35.833 --> 40:41.400
But that grand, my
great-grandfather.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.766
GATES: Mm-hmm. Edward.
DANIELS: Edward.

40:45.466 --> 40:48.933
Shot my great-grandmother
and killed her.

40:49.333 --> 40:51.333
GATES: Okay.
DANIELS: How accurate is that?

40:51.366 --> 40:53.666
GATES: We're going to find out.
DANIELS: Okay.

40:54.300 --> 40:58.300
GATES: As it turns out, the
family story was quite accurate.

40:58.333 --> 41:01.733
We found its tragic details
in an article published

41:01.766 --> 41:06.400
in the "Philadelphia Inquirer"
on March 30th, 1922.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.700
DANIELS: "Negro kills wife.
Shoots self.

41:11.733 --> 41:14.233
Edward Watson,
colored, 45 years old,

41:14.266 --> 41:18.133
shot his wife Mary,
32 years old,

41:18.900 --> 41:22.566
last evening in the drug
store of Jerome Levinson,

41:22.600 --> 41:25.566
19th and Fitzwater streets.

41:26.166 --> 41:29.633
Mrs. Watson was hit below
the heart and died later.

41:29.666 --> 41:32.133
After shooting his wife,
Watson fired into his

41:32.166 --> 41:36.900
own mouth and it is
expected that he will die."

41:38.933 --> 41:41.300
GATES: Mmm.
That's a lot to take in.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.333
DANIELS: Mm-hmm.
It's coming back to me now.

41:43.366 --> 41:45.033
I think that she
had had an affair.

41:45.066 --> 41:47.933
GATES: Did you know that he
turned the gun on himself?

41:47.966 --> 41:48.933
DANIELS: No.

41:48.966 --> 41:50.342
I didn't know he
tried to kill himself.

41:50.366 --> 41:52.166
I mean this is the
first time I'm actually

41:52.200 --> 41:53.400
hearing this and seeing...

41:53.433 --> 41:55.100
GATES: Gotcha.

41:55.133 --> 41:58.700
DANIELS: It in writing that this
wasn't some sort of folklore.

41:59.133 --> 42:01.900
GATES: Against all odds,
Edward survived his own

42:01.933 --> 42:05.766
suicide attempt, then stood
trial for his wife's murder.

42:07.866 --> 42:10.800
The court found him
to be of unsound mind,

42:10.833 --> 42:13.966
and sentenced him to a
state-run hospital for the

42:14.000 --> 42:16.833
criminally insane in
Fairview, Pennsylvania.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.433
But Edward didn't
stay at Fairview.

42:21.933 --> 42:23.833
When we found his
discharge papers,

42:23.866 --> 42:26.033
they showed that
after six years,

42:26.066 --> 42:29.433
Edward simply left the
institution, without permission.

42:31.366 --> 42:32.300
DANIELS: What do
you mean he left?

42:32.333 --> 42:33.866
GATES: He just walked away.

42:33.900 --> 42:37.000
He just split after
spending six years there.

42:37.033 --> 42:38.809
DANIELS: Wait, so he
kills my great-grandmother.

42:38.833 --> 42:39.900
GATES: Right.

42:39.933 --> 42:41.566
DANIELS: Goes into a
mental institution.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.833
GATES: Spends six years.

42:42.866 --> 42:44.133
DANIELS: And just walks out.

42:44.166 --> 42:45.533
GATES: And he
walked away, man.

42:45.566 --> 42:46.833
We don't know for sure.

42:46.866 --> 42:48.933
We spoke to a Pennsylvania
legal scholar and he said

42:48.966 --> 42:51.133
that it was likely he
just walked away and

42:51.166 --> 42:53.800
simply never reported back.

42:53.833 --> 42:56.100
What's it like to learn that?

42:56.133 --> 42:58.566
DANIELS: Well, I was told,

42:58.600 --> 43:01.866
again, folklore
was told to me that

43:01.900 --> 43:06.266
he never went to jail
for it, for the murder.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.433
GATES: Well,
that's kind of right.

43:08.466 --> 43:10.200
I mean he went to a
mental institution,

43:10.233 --> 43:13.266
six years and
then he walked out.

43:13.300 --> 43:16.400
DANIELS: Walked out. Wow.

43:19.666 --> 43:22.666
GATES: Edward's story was
about to take a final twist,

43:22.700 --> 43:26.433
one that neither Lee nor
I could fully understand.

43:28.166 --> 43:32.333
After leaving Fairview, Edward
returned to Philadelphia,

43:32.366 --> 43:34.400
found a job at a newspaper,

43:34.433 --> 43:37.766
and rebuilt his relationship
with his children,

43:37.800 --> 43:41.633
despite the fact that he'd
murdered their mother.

43:42.700 --> 43:44.433
GATES: Your mom
remembered him as a sweet,

43:44.466 --> 43:46.400
well-dressed, debonair man.

43:46.433 --> 43:49.400
But her father would always
tear up when she'd ask him

43:49.433 --> 43:51.633
questions about his
mother's death which is

43:51.666 --> 43:53.400
certainly understandable.

43:53.433 --> 43:55.242
DANIELS: It's complicated.
GATES: It's complicated.

43:55.266 --> 43:56.509
DANIELS: It's
really complicated.

43:56.533 --> 44:00.233
You know, I had this weird
feeling as a kid if in fact

44:00.266 --> 44:05.300
he did kill his wife
that's bad because,

44:06.033 --> 44:10.400
and so I think having my
mother and father fighting

44:10.433 --> 44:13.633
I think in the back of my head
I always felt that something

44:13.666 --> 44:15.300
like that could
happen to my mother.

44:15.333 --> 44:17.400
GATES: Oh, that's horrible
to live in fear of that.

44:17.433 --> 44:18.700
DANIELS: Yeah.

44:18.733 --> 44:20.866
And so, uh, and yet his
kids were so loving to him.

44:20.900 --> 44:23.433
It was just a contradiction to,

44:23.466 --> 44:26.033
and a forgiveness for
killing their mother.

44:26.466 --> 44:28.966
GATES: I was going to say
they forgave him and they go,

44:29.000 --> 44:30.700
well, you've got to move on.

44:30.733 --> 44:33.400
Now's now and it's a terrible
thing that happened

44:33.433 --> 44:35.866
and they moved on.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.866
That was a monumental
act of forgiveness.

44:37.900 --> 44:42.200
DANIELS: You just don't
understand how people change

44:42.233 --> 44:45.800
their whole, I look at my kids
and I think about how they

44:45.833 --> 44:49.600
view the world and how I view
the world and how my parents

44:49.633 --> 44:52.766
view the world and how
their parents view the world,

44:53.266 --> 44:54.600
viewed the world.

44:54.633 --> 44:57.033
We all change.

44:57.066 --> 45:02.600
What was normal for them
is not normal right now.

45:03.466 --> 45:04.533
GATES: No, no.

45:04.566 --> 45:08.100
Generational, dramatic
generational changes.

45:08.133 --> 45:10.133
DANIELS: Mm-hum.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.866
GATES: I had one
more surprise for Lee.

45:13.900 --> 45:16.666
He told me that, growing up,
he'd felt a connection to his

45:16.700 --> 45:19.433
mother's mother's
family, the Leecans.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.800
They were musical, he recalled,

45:21.833 --> 45:25.600
and fun-loving, and he
wanted to know more about them.

45:25.633 --> 45:29.300
We traced this line back to
Lee's third great-grandparents,

45:29.333 --> 45:32.066
Peter and Mary Ann Collins.

45:32.633 --> 45:34.633
They were listed, by name,

45:34.666 --> 45:37.533
in the 1850 census
for Philadelphia,

45:37.566 --> 45:40.366
which tells us
something very significant

45:40.400 --> 45:42.266
about their status.

45:42.800 --> 45:48.333
The only people listed by name
in the 1850 census were free.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.066
DANIELS: That's why they're
so damn uppity, them Leecans.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.866
GATES: This is 15 years...

45:53.900 --> 45:55.566
DANIELS: They weren't slaves.

45:55.600 --> 45:59.466
I come from some uppity people.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.900
GATES: They were free.
Did you have any idea?

46:01.933 --> 46:04.400
DANIELS: No. And that's
so fabulous to hear.

46:04.433 --> 46:07.866
It explains their joie de vivre.

46:09.066 --> 46:11.533
GATES: When Peter and Mary Ann
lived in Philadelphia,

46:11.566 --> 46:14.900
it was a center of free Black
life in the United States,

46:15.766 --> 46:18.500
a place where African
Americans could raise families

46:18.533 --> 46:20.300
in relative security.

46:20.333 --> 46:22.766
The city had
thriving Black churches,

46:22.800 --> 46:26.833
Black business, and an array
of Black social organizations.

46:28.566 --> 46:32.433
But Lee's ancestors weren't
originally from Philadelphia.

46:32.466 --> 46:34.900
They were both born in Delaware,

46:35.633 --> 46:38.933
just miles to the south,
and a world away.

46:40.033 --> 46:43.433
In Delaware, free people
of color were subject to a

46:43.466 --> 46:46.866
restrictive series of laws
that limited their rights,

46:47.933 --> 46:50.433
and threatened them
with terrible punishments.

46:51.300 --> 46:54.733
It could result in
being sold into servitude.

46:55.300 --> 46:58.000
DANIELS: So free but sort of?

46:58.700 --> 47:00.366
GATES: Free but sort of.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.666
On the edge and if you made
one mistake you could be

47:03.700 --> 47:05.900
sold back into slavery.

47:05.933 --> 47:08.009
DANIELS: You think that's the
reason why they skipped town

47:08.033 --> 47:09.700
and went over to Pennsylvania?

47:09.733 --> 47:11.176
GATES: My brother,
Philadelphia must have

47:11.200 --> 47:14.133
seemed like heaven,
like quite an oasis.

47:14.166 --> 47:16.333
They go, I'm outta here.

47:16.366 --> 47:19.466
It was the nearest free city
to the southern slave states.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.166
What's it like to learn this?

47:22.200 --> 47:26.266
DANIELS: Not only is it a
history lesson but

47:26.566 --> 47:30.100
it's personal.
It is, uh, powerful.

47:31.533 --> 47:33.900
Our people have
gone through so much.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.833
GATES: When the
Civil War ended,

47:37.866 --> 47:40.633
Philadelphia had that
largest Black population of

47:40.666 --> 47:42.900
any city in the north.

47:43.333 --> 47:46.700
But it was by no means a
paradise for African Americans.

47:47.966 --> 47:50.500
Black people were at the
bottom of a rapidly changing

47:50.533 --> 47:54.900
social structure, competing for
work with recent immigrants

47:54.933 --> 47:58.700
and facing a rising
tide of Jim Crow racism.

47:58.733 --> 48:00.966
Lee's ancestors found
themselves living in

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
largely Black neighborhoods,

48:03.033 --> 48:07.900
filled with poor tenement
housing and poor schools.

48:07.933 --> 48:10.500
Lee's third great-grandfather
Peter worked as a

48:10.533 --> 48:13.466
manual laborer, and
struggled to make a living

48:13.500 --> 48:15.400
in this environment.

48:15.433 --> 48:17.966
Struggles his
children would inherit,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.400
leaving Lee filled with
gratitude at the thought of

48:21.433 --> 48:23.400
all they endured.

48:24.700 --> 48:26.233
DANIELS: How dare I complain.

48:26.266 --> 48:31.066
How dare I complain or
feel bad or woe is me.

48:31.833 --> 48:33.133
GATES: Right.

48:33.166 --> 48:35.900
DANIELS: For whatever small
problem that I have right now.

48:35.933 --> 48:40.166
They are looking down from the
heavens and they are so proud.

48:41.200 --> 48:45.300
And it fills me with pride
that I know I made them happy.

48:46.633 --> 48:47.766
GATES: That's great.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.176
Can you imagine them
sitting around Philly going,

48:49.200 --> 48:50.509
man, we're going to
have an ancestor.

48:50.533 --> 48:53.233
He's going to be rich.
He's going to be famous.

48:53.700 --> 48:56.266
Pass me the bourbon
isn't that great?

48:56.833 --> 48:58.066
DANIELS: Yeah.

48:58.566 --> 49:01.600
GATES: The paper trail had
run out for each of my guests.

49:01.633 --> 49:04.300
It was time to unfurl
their full family trees.

49:06.533 --> 49:08.266
HALL: It just keeps on going.

49:08.300 --> 49:10.200
Wow.

49:10.900 --> 49:12.566
DANIELS: My tribe.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.500
GATES: And see what
DNA could tell us

49:14.533 --> 49:16.500
about their deeper roots.

49:17.233 --> 49:21.800
For Rebecca, this meant seeing
her hidden heritage quantified.

49:22.333 --> 49:25.300
She's 9% sub-saharan African,

49:26.100 --> 49:29.366
finally bringing closure
to the mystery that had hung

49:29.400 --> 49:32.200
over her family for
more than a century.

49:34.333 --> 49:39.233
What is the first thing you
are going to tell your mother?

49:39.266 --> 49:40.933
HALL: I don't know.

49:40.966 --> 49:43.466
I'm probably going
to say, you know,

49:43.500 --> 49:49.433
ma, not only are we Black.
Like, we're really Black.

49:50.433 --> 49:52.666
GATES: You're really Black.
You have deep...

49:52.700 --> 49:56.666
HALL: Deep and the stories.

49:56.966 --> 49:58.333
You're not going to believe it.

49:58.366 --> 50:00.266
GATES: Yeah.

50:00.633 --> 50:02.200
HALL: She probably won't.

50:04.200 --> 50:08.200
GATES: Lee Daniels' DNA echoed
Rebecca's in showing just how

50:08.233 --> 50:11.533
blended African Americans
and europeans actually are,

50:13.100 --> 50:16.433
and how often we
seek to hide that fact.

50:17.100 --> 50:19.376
Indeed Lee he thought he might
have a significant amount of

50:19.400 --> 50:23.500
Native American ancestry,
but his admixture test told

50:23.533 --> 50:25.133
a different story.

50:26.366 --> 50:28.409
DANIELS: 1% of Native American,
I'm completely wrong.

50:28.433 --> 50:29.466
GATES: Completely wrong.

50:29.500 --> 50:30.676
DANIELS: I thought,
for some reason,

50:30.700 --> 50:32.109
I don't know where
my family get's that...

50:32.133 --> 50:34.533
Cause you look at my family,
they look like Indians.

50:34.566 --> 50:36.400
The Leecans especially.

50:36.433 --> 50:39.233
They look like they got a whole
lot of Indian up in them.

50:39.266 --> 50:41.176
GATES: The reason they
look like it is because of

50:41.200 --> 50:43.766
all that European
ancestry you have.

50:44.300 --> 50:46.300
Look at that, you're a
third European. Almost.

50:46.333 --> 50:48.800
DANIELS: 19% England.
Who'd have thunk that.

50:49.100 --> 50:52.500
GATES: You are just
under a third of white.

50:54.233 --> 50:58.433
This surprise would
soon yield another.

50:58.466 --> 51:01.766
When we compared Lee's DNA
to that of everyone who's

51:01.800 --> 51:06.100
been in our series, we
found a significant match,

51:06.133 --> 51:09.566
evidence of a cousin
he didn't know he had,

51:10.366 --> 51:13.700
one who almost certainly
shares his European heritage.

51:14.433 --> 51:16.700
Would you please turn the page?

51:18.766 --> 51:21.566
DANIELS: No. No!

51:21.600 --> 51:23.166
GATES: Yes. Absolutely.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.342
DANIELS: How is this possible?

51:24.366 --> 51:27.466
GATES: Because of that 29%
white ancestry you have.

51:27.500 --> 51:29.000
DANIELS: Mia Farrow?

51:29.033 --> 51:31.100
GATES: Your DNA
cousin is Mia Farrow.

51:31.133 --> 51:32.666
DANIELS: Ain't that something!

51:32.700 --> 51:35.966
GATES: Lee and Mia share a
small identical segment of DNA

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
on their fourth chromosomes,

51:38.033 --> 51:40.833
meaning they have a
distant common ancestor

51:40.866 --> 51:43.366
somewhere in their family trees.

51:44.433 --> 51:47.466
We don't know where.
We don't know their name.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.033
But the DNA don't lie.

51:49.066 --> 51:51.500
DANIELS: Isn't that something.
Hey, cousin.

51:51.533 --> 51:52.666
GATES: Isn't that great?

51:52.700 --> 51:55.033
DANIELS: Beautiful.
It's really beautiful, Skip.

51:55.766 --> 51:57.566
GATES: That's the end
of our journey with

51:57.600 --> 51:59.800
Lee Daniels and Rebecca Hall.

51:59.833 --> 52:02.566
Please join me next
time when we unlock the

52:02.600 --> 52:07.466
secrets of the past for new
guests on another episode of

52:07.500 --> 52:09.766
"Finding Your Roots".
