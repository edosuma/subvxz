00:06.441 --> 00:07.790
Previously on
"Just Add Magic"...

00:07.877 --> 00:09.574
This is one mystery
we didn't solve.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.011
- Chuck.
- What?

00:11.098 --> 00:13.448
That's the name of the boy.
Chuck Hankins.

00:13.535 --> 00:16.103
He went missing in 1965.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.713
And Willie Thompson said

00:17.800 --> 00:20.150
Chuck had no family
looking out for him.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.239
Guess I have a knack for
this magic stuff.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.241
You know the Traveler.

00:24.328 --> 00:27.157
Is that what she's
calling herself these days?

00:27.244 --> 00:29.942
This all started
long before you.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.162
What I want is far bigger
than any of you.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.034
You're simply in my way.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.905
I'm sorry it's
come to this, Chuck,

00:35.992 --> 00:37.733
but you left us no choice.

00:37.820 --> 00:38.777
[wind blowing]

00:38.864 --> 00:39.952
What did you do?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.216
Enjoy Lavender Heights.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.869
You're never leaving.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.744
Hi, Jake.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.317
Kelly: My gut's
been telling me that

00:56.404 --> 00:58.014
there's something wrong
with Jake.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.842
Ida: What are you saying?

00:59.929 --> 01:01.757
Kelly: The Jake
who's in your kitchen

01:01.844 --> 01:03.715
is not our Jake.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.587
Anybody hungry?

01:13.812 --> 01:15.510
I can't believe
that's Chuck.

01:15.597 --> 01:16.946
He must have
taken over Jake

01:17.033 --> 01:18.339
to get out of
Lavender Heights.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.080
It's actually genius.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.560
Wish I had
thought of that.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.475
- Yeah, but how
did he do it?
- I know.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.564
- It's just so weird.
- I know.

01:26.651 --> 01:29.350
- This reeks of schnitzel.
- I know.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.874
Wait.
You're right.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.311
Walk In My Shoes
Schnitzel.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.531
We used that recipe once
when we were your age

01:36.618 --> 01:38.924
to sneak into a movie.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.535
Grandma,
you snuck into a movie?

01:40.622 --> 01:43.668
I wasn't always your
grandmother, Kelly.

01:43.755 --> 01:46.149
Okay, so if Chuck cooked the
Walk In My Shoes Schnitzel,

01:46.236 --> 01:48.499
then all we have to do
is get him to say Chuck
three times in a row,

01:48.586 --> 01:49.979
and it'll break
the spell.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.807
But how are you gonna
get him to say that

01:51.894 --> 01:53.939
without him getting
suspicious?

01:54.026 --> 01:55.724
I have an idea.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.685
She sells seashells
by the seashore.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.339
It's easy.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.993
Well, maybe if
you say it once,

02:04.080 --> 02:05.995
but not three times fast.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.605
What are you guys
talking about?

02:07.692 --> 02:09.303
Hey, Jake.
We're doing
tongue twisters.

02:09.389 --> 02:11.348
- Wanna try one?
- Sure, why not?

02:11.435 --> 02:13.307
You have to say,
"How much wood could
a woodchuck chuck

02:13.394 --> 02:14.482
"if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?"

02:14.569 --> 02:15.918
How much wood
could a woodchuck chuck,

02:16.005 --> 02:17.876
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?
Easy.

02:17.963 --> 02:20.140
Well, not three times fast,
it's not.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.793
How much wood
could a woodchuck chuck,

02:21.880 --> 02:23.012
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?

02:23.099 --> 02:24.144
How much wood
could a woodchuck chuck,

02:24.231 --> 02:25.232
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?

02:25.319 --> 02:26.668
Faster or
it doesn't count.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.104
How much wood
could a woodchuck
chuck chuck,

02:28.191 --> 02:30.324
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?

02:30.411 --> 02:31.803
Wait. That wasn't right.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.457
I think I said woodchuck
too many times.

02:33.544 --> 02:34.980
Three, to be exact.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.330
But that--
that's okay.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.158
Well, as much fun
as this is, I am beat.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.681
See you guys in the a.m.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.073
- Bye. Goodnight.
- Bye. Have a good night.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.427
Guys, he said Chuck
three times fast,

02:46.514 --> 02:47.776
and he's still Jake.

02:47.863 --> 02:50.213
Or fake Jake.
Or Chake.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.432
- Or Chuck.
- [bell jingles]

02:51.519 --> 02:53.173
Uh, let's go with Chake.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.958
That means he didn't eat the
Walk In My Shoes Schnitzel.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.265
And we still have no idea
how Chuck became Jake.

02:58.352 --> 03:01.268
Breaking this spell
is gonna be harder
than we thought.

03:04.314 --> 03:07.187
♪♪

03:10.668 --> 03:11.974
So, we're all
in agreement.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.150
Yes. No more eating
Jake's food.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.847
I want to strangle him.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.893
You can't.
That's still Jake's body,

03:17.980 --> 03:19.416
and you don't
want to hurt him.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.026
Get hold of
your temper, Ida,

03:21.113 --> 03:22.289
we need to
play it smart.

03:22.376 --> 03:23.855
Yeah, we all have to
act normal

03:23.942 --> 03:25.901
until we can figure out
how to reverse the spell.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.946
[sighs] Fine.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.427
I'll just try to
stay away from him.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.255
You can't.
Don't you have plans
at Le Grande Falls

03:32.342 --> 03:33.517
to take him
to lunch today?

03:33.604 --> 03:35.040
No way!

03:35.127 --> 03:37.739
Ida, if you cancel
at the last minute,

03:37.826 --> 03:39.131
he'll get suspicious.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.004
And you did buy him
that nice jacket.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.049
I'm on my way
to return it.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.355
Luckily,
I kept the receipt.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.705
Please, Mama P.
We need him away

03:47.792 --> 03:49.490
so we can figure out
how to save Jake.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.840
And we don't want Chuck
cooking for your customers.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.929
Who knows?
He could be spelling them.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.409
And maybe when
you're at lunch,

03:55.496 --> 03:57.019
you can figure out
what his plan is,

03:57.106 --> 03:58.673
because we're at
a loss over here.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.938
- It's one meal.
- One very expensive meal.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.679
Not to mention
the money I'm losing

04:04.766 --> 04:06.507
by closing this place
for the afternoon.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.813
Well, you're not exactly
slammed in here.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.207
There's no need to put
salt in my wounds, Darbie.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.991
- [bell jingles]
- Oh, speak of the devil.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.123
- Hi, Jake.
- It's Jake.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.951
Jake, buddy.
How's it goin'?

04:16.038 --> 04:18.040
Why are you all
acting weird?

04:18.127 --> 04:21.216
We're just really excited
that you get to go to
Le Grande Falls today.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.305
- And jealous.
- Mm-hm.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.785
And we wanted to
see you off.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.177
Well, I'm excited, too.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.527
Thanks again for
taking me, Mama P.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.572
My pleasure.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.487
[stammers]
I got you a present.
It's right there.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.402
You got me a jacket?

04:32.489 --> 04:35.144
Only because there's
a dress code at
Le Grande Falls.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.494
Wow.
Thanks, Mama P.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.714
If it doesn't fit,
I could always return it,

04:39.801 --> 04:40.671
and get my money back.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.456
It fits perfectly.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.284
So, how do I look?

04:44.371 --> 04:49.637
Like Jake.
Only... different.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.857
Well, I guess there's
nothing to do
but go to this lunch.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.250
[clears throat]

04:54.337 --> 04:55.512
You two have fun.

[bell jingles]

05:03.128 --> 05:05.130
She looks like she's
going to the dentist

05:05.217 --> 05:07.350
instead of the nicest
restaurant in town.

05:07.437 --> 05:10.310
We don't have much time.
We need to figure out
a recipe to save Jake.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.400
While you do that,
we'll go to Chuck's trailer
in Lavender Heights.

05:13.487 --> 05:14.792
Maybe we can
find a clue

05:14.879 --> 05:17.012
as to how he
pulled this off.

05:17.099 --> 05:20.232
Don't do anything hasty
while we're gone.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.758
Wh-- Why is everyone
looking at me?

05:26.282 --> 05:28.893
Okay, maybe I've done
one or two spells on my own,

05:28.980 --> 05:31.461
but it's really Mama P that
we should be worried about.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.116
Yeah,
Chuck's impersonating
the one person

05:34.203 --> 05:36.248
she actually cares about.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.511
This isn't gonna be good.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:46.737 --> 05:49.436
$16 for a bowl of soup.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.915
You can buy
five Jakewiches
for that.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.961
Yes, you sure can.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.354
You sure you want to
eat here?

05:54.441 --> 05:55.529
This place is
really expensive.

05:55.616 --> 05:59.228
Of course.
Get whatever you want.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.883
Except the soup.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.014
Can I start with
the shrimp cocktail,

06:03.101 --> 06:04.407
and get the
surf-n-turf?

06:04.494 --> 06:06.366
That's lobster
and steak, right?

06:06.453 --> 06:10.413
Yes, Jake.
It's lobster and steak.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.729
Okay, we need to figure out
how long Chuck has been Jake,

06:21.816 --> 06:23.252
and what we might have
said to him.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.862
I've said
a lot of things.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.777
Me, too. We better
retrace our steps

06:26.864 --> 06:27.909
over the past few days.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.694
Okay, let's see.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.393
On Thursday,
I saw Jake.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.699
I told him I was worried
about my new school,

06:35.786 --> 06:39.660
and he said, "Hannah,
I've known you how long?
Ten years?"

06:39.747 --> 06:43.098
And I go, "Uh, I think it's
closer to three years.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.579
And he responded with,
"Right. It feels longer.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.798
"I remember my first day
of grammar school,

06:47.885 --> 06:50.584
"and I was afraid
I wouldn't make friends,
but I did.

06:50.671 --> 06:51.672
"You'll be okay."

06:51.759 --> 06:53.151
Grammar school?

06:53.238 --> 06:55.458
Yeah, now I see
how odd that was.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.025
He was right about
one thing.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.418
You're gonna do great
at your new school.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.463
Thanks.
I hate to admit it,

07:00.550 --> 07:02.117
but Chake's
a good listener.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.249
Well, when I saw Jake
the other day,

07:04.336 --> 07:06.643
he made me feel worse.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.819
I went to see him
after you guys took
the book away from me.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.647
Darbie: Do we really need to
relive that?

07:10.734 --> 07:12.823
Kelly: We do.
When I told Jake,
he goes,

07:12.910 --> 07:14.956
"I can't believe
they would do that do you."

07:15.043 --> 07:17.785
And I responded,
"Well, I'm sure
they meant well."

07:17.872 --> 07:19.656
He didn't think so.
He said,

07:19.743 --> 07:22.311
"You're too nice, Kelly.
I'd be super mad.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.095
"Haven't you done
a lot of good with
the book?

07:24.182 --> 07:25.401
"Where do you think
they hid it?"

07:25.488 --> 07:27.664
And then I said,
"No idea.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.493
"Probably at Hannah's.
Darbie loses everything."

07:30.580 --> 07:33.235
Hey, I don't lose
everything.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.367
Okay, maybe some things.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.979
Now that I think about it,
Jake would have never acted
like that.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.764
He was just trying to
get me more upset.

07:40.851 --> 07:43.985
He was also
trying to find out
where the book was.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.073
What about you?

07:45.160 --> 07:46.378
I saw him a few times.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.903
He was actually
pretty nice to me.

07:48.990 --> 07:52.341
I forgot my money,
so he gave me a free
Jakerito.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.083
The next time I saw Jake,
I forgot my phone. Again.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.737
He usually just
lets me borrow his,

07:56.824 --> 07:58.695
but he didn't have
his phone that day.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.610
I said,
"But you always have
your cell phone."

08:00.697 --> 08:02.699
And he goes,
"I left it at home,
I guess.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.614
"Here, have a free
Jakerito."

08:06.355 --> 08:07.878
The next day,

08:07.965 --> 08:09.706
I had forgot
we made plans to hang out,

08:09.793 --> 08:11.229
but he wasn't upset.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.014
- Instead, he--
- Kelly: Let me guess.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.930
He offered you
a free Jakerito?

08:16.017 --> 08:19.803
There's one common theme
in all those memories,
Darbie.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.632
I know. I really need to
stop forgetting things.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.548
No. The free food
should have been a clue.

08:25.635 --> 08:26.984
Jake never gives away
free food.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.247
Does anyone else
feel really bad

08:29.334 --> 08:31.511
that we didn't know
Jake was Chake?

08:31.598 --> 08:34.426
We were so wrapped up
in our own drama,

08:34.514 --> 08:37.429
we didn't see
our best friend
was spelled.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.823
We haven't been
very good friends,
have we?

08:39.909 --> 08:42.086
But we're gonna figure out
how to fix it.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.523
You're right.
We will.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.221
I just wish we knew why
he was doing this.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.701
Why wouldn't he?

08:47.788 --> 08:49.529
As Jake,
he had access to us,

08:49.616 --> 08:51.226
the book,
the spice pantry--

08:51.313 --> 08:52.967
And it got him out of
Lavender Heights.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.447
As far as villain moves go,
it's pretty solid.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.363
He gave us
so much free food,

08:58.450 --> 09:00.104
what if he's been
spelling us?

09:00.191 --> 09:02.106
I feel okay.

09:02.193 --> 09:05.545
Wait. Have you guys felt
angry or suspicious,

09:05.632 --> 09:06.850
or the need to
only tell the truth?

09:06.937 --> 09:09.070
No, but there are
other spells.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.550
You're fine, Hannah.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.682
I think we'd know
if we were spelled.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.902
We need to find a recipe
to save Jake.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.608
Ugh.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.523
Well, he clearly
didn't feel the need

09:27.610 --> 09:29.481
to clean up
after himself.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.572
Maybe because he wasn't
planning on coming back.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.662
Remember these?

09:35.749 --> 09:38.316
Little Judy's.

09:38.403 --> 09:39.927
They were so unhealthy.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.582
I remember your mom
wouldn't let you have 'em.

09:42.669 --> 09:46.107
Chuck used to
sneak them to me
at school.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.196
Oh, what a fool I was.

09:48.283 --> 09:51.678
Oh, don't beat
yourself up, Gina.

09:51.765 --> 09:52.722
He fooled us all.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.943
[gasping]

09:56.030 --> 09:57.118
Over here.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.602
I'm guessing these are
the remnants

10:02.689 --> 10:05.387
of whatever magical recipe
he was cooking.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.781
Let's take this
back to the house.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.653
We need to figure out
what's in this dish.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.487
You're still hungry?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.402
I didn't think it was
possible, either,

10:20.489 --> 10:21.969
but the food is so good.

10:22.056 --> 10:25.189
It's like you're...
eating for two.

10:25.276 --> 10:28.105
Hey, uh, thanks again for
bringing me here, Mama P.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.672
My pleasure.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.543
I'm having fun.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.067
Hey, uh,
what do you think's
going on with Kelly?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.199
What do you mean?

10:35.286 --> 10:37.941
Hannah and Darbie
mentioned she's been
using magic too much.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.421
Do you think she is?

10:39.508 --> 10:42.990
She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.035
- Why do you ask?
- No reason.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.517
You know,
Kelly mentioned that

10:48.604 --> 10:50.693
they're rotating the book
between their houses.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.652
I really think they should
include the OCs

10:52.739 --> 10:54.697
in the rotation,
unless they already are.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.656
No. I haven't seen the book.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.617
Wherever it is,
it's hidden well.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.053
I just hope it
doesn't go to Darbie.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.054
For the book's sake.

11:10.844 --> 11:11.975
Once we save Jake,

11:12.062 --> 11:13.498
what do we do
about Chuck?

11:13.585 --> 11:15.370
One step at a time.
Let's focus on Jake,

11:15.457 --> 11:17.981
and then we can
worry about Chuck and
whatever he's planning.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.504
I found one.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.071
Kick Him Out
Chicken Soup.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.857
Hey, there's a riddle.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.250
"When an unwanted guest
is hanging about,

11:26.337 --> 11:28.949
"a bite of this soup
will soon kick him out."

11:29.036 --> 11:31.516
"Just know with a stew
so warm and hearty,

11:31.603 --> 11:34.606
"the guest might not
fondly remember the party."

11:34.694 --> 11:36.652
Chuck's definitely
an unwanted guest.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.393
Well, maybe we could
use this

11:38.480 --> 11:40.395
to kick Chuck
out of Jake's body.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.397
Well, it's worth a shot.

11:42.484 --> 11:46.967
The recipe calls for
livonian cayenne and
elysian parsley.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.578
I bet Miss Silvers
has those in her
spice cabinet.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.278
Whoa.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.411
- I thought my room
was a mess.
- Hi, girls.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.979
What are you doing with
all this old stuff,
Mrs. Quinn?

11:59.066 --> 12:00.807
Well, as head of
the historical society,

12:00.894 --> 12:02.547
I have to catalog
everything.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.810
And then I choose
what goes up in

12:03.897 --> 12:06.334
the Saffron Falls exhibit
in City Hall.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.205
Hey. Is this
Main Street?

12:08.292 --> 12:10.207
Yeah. In the 1800s.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.906
Look, Mama P's used to be
an old timey inn.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.735
Technically, back then
it would have been
a present timey in.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.040
True.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.563
Mom, this looks like
a lot of work.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.391
Yeah,
it is a lot of work.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.176
Bringing anything
in Saffron Falls

12:22.263 --> 12:24.352
up to the 21st century
is hard.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.093
I'd settle for
the 20th century.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.225
I'm sure whatever you do
will be great, Mrs. Quinn.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.140
You have a lot
to go through.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.533
Oh, no, this is just
a fraction of it.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.230
You should see
down at City Hall.

12:33.317 --> 12:37.191
I mean,
stacks and stacks of old
city records and photos.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.670
That's even more of
a mess.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.328
Uh, guys.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.461
Can I see you
in the kitchen
for a second?

12:50.857 --> 12:51.814
What is it?

12:51.901 --> 12:53.424
Look at this.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.991
It's just an old
schoolhouse photo.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.297
No, second from the right.

12:59.387 --> 13:02.129
- Is that--
- Chuck.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.304
Look at the date.

13:03.391 --> 13:07.656
September 1, 1868.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.658
Wait. That means...

13:09.745 --> 13:11.312
Chuck is not from
the '60s.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.922
Not the 1960s.

13:13.009 --> 13:13.923
Look at the back.

13:16.708 --> 13:20.712
James Smith, Gary Billings,
Charles Peizer.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.105
Charles Peizer.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.804
Charles as in Chuck?

13:24.891 --> 13:28.938
And Peizer as in
Peizer Park, Peizer Avenue
and Peizer Square.

The boy we thought
was frozen in 1965

13:47.783 --> 13:49.567

the 1800s.

But how?

13:50.786 --> 13:53.267
I want to say magic,

13:53.354 --> 13:55.269
but I know that's
not helpful.

13:55.356 --> 13:58.620
If Chuck is from
the 1800s,

13:58.707 --> 14:01.492
this is bigger than
all of us.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.972
All the more reason
to figure out

14:03.059 --> 14:04.974
what Chuck used
to become Jake.

14:07.455 --> 14:08.760
What is that?

Spice detector

14:10.197 --> 14:11.502
What does it do?

14:11.589 --> 14:13.113
It'll tell us
which spice families

14:13.200 --> 14:15.593
are in the food that
Chuck ate to become Jake.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.396
The read means
he used werpoes.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.485
The blue is for livonian.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.052
And the orange?

14:39.139 --> 14:40.967
I don't have orange
listed here.

14:41.054 --> 14:44.187
So Chuck used some sort of
super secret

not on the card
ingredient.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.538
That's not good.

What if our Kick Him Out
Chicken Soup

14:48.931 --> 14:51.064
isn't strong enough?

14:51.151 --> 14:54.850
Well, they say smell is
more powerful than taste.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.330
What if there was a way
to get Chuck

14:56.417 --> 14:57.679
to breathe in the soup
instead of eating it?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.159
What would that do?

- Well, yeah.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.122
It works better than
taking medicine

15:06.209 --> 15:07.428

concentrated,

you offered us your morbium

19:07.972 --> 19:09.496
for our Curse Breaking cake,

19:09.583 --> 19:11.846
but my instinct said
not to take it.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.675
Chuck used morbium
to become Jake,

19:14.762 --> 19:17.025
and my gut says this is
the only way to save him.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.334
It's worth it.
For Jake.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.074
I agree with Kelly.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.120
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.387
I trust you, Kelly.

19:37.306 --> 19:40.527
Is my shirt on backward
or something?

19:40.614 --> 19:42.833
No, we're just really
trying to get the soup right.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.879
Will you try again?
I adjusted the seasonings.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.234
Did you really think
this would work?

19:52.321 --> 19:54.976
- What do you mean?
- Kick Him Out Chicken Soup?

19:55.063 --> 19:57.587
Maybe if I was an
unwanted guest at a party.

19:57.674 --> 20:00.024
I thought you were
smarter than that.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.026
Uh, I think he knows
we know.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.638
I was suspicious
when you offered

20:04.725 --> 20:06.814
I take the weekend off.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.512
But when you ordered
that $17 soufflé,

20:09.599 --> 20:11.558
- I knew.
- What a waste.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.429
Come on.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.431
It was delicious.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.694
You're never gonna
save your friend.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.914
And you're never gonna stop me
from getting what I want.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.403
It doesn't burn anymore.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.100
There's one thing
you didn't count on.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.320
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

20:34.407 --> 20:36.147
You're not the only one
with morbium.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.763
[coughing]

20:42.850 --> 20:44.721
Gina: Oh, no.
It was too powerful.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.114
Becky: Is everybody okay?

20:46.201 --> 20:47.158
- Ida: Girls?
- Darbie: I'm okay,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.248
I just can't see anything.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.380
- Kelly: I'm here, too.
- Hannah: Me, too.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.469
- Jake: What's going on?
- Ida: Jake, is that you?

20:53.556 --> 20:54.862
I-- I mean,
the real you?

20:54.949 --> 20:56.124
Yeah, of course.
Who else would it be?

20:56.211 --> 20:57.081
Darbie:
You don't want to know.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.779
[coughing]

21:00.607 --> 21:02.217
Chuck.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.914
- [sizzling]
- Ahh.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.095
You can slow me down.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.749
But it's too late
to stop me.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.751
It doesn't look that way
from where I'm standing.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.363
Good luck
saving your friend.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.669
We just saved Jake.

21:19.756 --> 21:20.801
Not that friend.

21:24.544 --> 21:25.762
