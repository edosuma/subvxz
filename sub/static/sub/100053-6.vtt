WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.687
Whatever we did, we also
brought a baby into this world.

00:03.690 --> 00:05.733
Guilt is hard to overcome...

00:05.736 --> 00:07.617
I wish we had a fresh start.

00:07.620 --> 00:09.246
...in any circumstance...

00:09.249 --> 00:10.995
Like it or not, you and I are gonna be

00:10.998 --> 00:12.123
in each other's lives.

00:12.126 --> 00:13.742
...especially in death...

00:13.745 --> 00:15.710
Jon... I don't want to erase him.

00:15.713 --> 00:16.757
That's understandable.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.960
I haven't been able to
look at Debra's things.

00:18.963 --> 00:20.726
Grief messes with your head.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.188
About the night Chad died.

00:22.191 --> 00:24.233
Eric has your brother's heart.

00:24.236 --> 00:25.487
Did you lose somebody, too?

00:25.490 --> 00:26.718
My fiancÃ©e.

00:26.721 --> 00:28.722
...until it's all you know.

00:28.725 --> 00:30.100
I haven't played since I got sick.

00:30.103 --> 00:32.381
Well, you're not sick
anymore. Open mic night?

00:32.384 --> 00:34.406
So, how do you free yourself...

00:34.409 --> 00:35.546
Maggie?

00:35.549 --> 00:38.509
...without pushing away
the ones you love the most?

00:38.512 --> 00:39.906
I've been fighting with my dad.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.929
We're just so different.

00:41.932 --> 00:43.648
I think Jon might be my father.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.715
I'm just saying, I've been going there

00:49.716 --> 00:51.078
for the better part of six months,

00:51.081 --> 00:52.773
and they have yet to get my name right.

00:52.776 --> 00:56.015
I was Margo. I was Meggy.

00:56.018 --> 00:58.597
At one point, I think I
was Muggy, like I'm weather?

00:59.542 --> 01:01.859
I don't understand why you're
still paying for coffee.

01:01.862 --> 01:02.781
Just do what I do.

01:02.784 --> 01:04.384
Wait for someone to get preoccupied

01:04.387 --> 01:05.555
- with their phone, and...
- Mm-hmm.

01:05.557 --> 01:06.933
...you take your free beverage.

01:08.843 --> 01:10.236
It's delicious.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.468
Something in the latte family.

01:12.471 --> 01:13.712
Suck on that, Muggy.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.195
So, uh...

01:18.198 --> 01:20.085
what did you end up doing last night?

01:20.088 --> 01:21.380
Uh, not much.

01:21.383 --> 01:23.234
I was at my old apartment.

01:24.144 --> 01:25.352
Playing piano.

01:25.355 --> 01:26.856
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:26.859 --> 01:28.711
Finally busted out
the old keyboard, huh?

01:28.714 --> 01:29.953
Good for you.

01:29.956 --> 01:31.207
- Yeah.
- Huh.

01:33.119 --> 01:36.246
Well, sounds like a wild night.

01:36.249 --> 01:37.166
Yeah.

01:37.169 --> 01:39.023
Seriously? Colin? Again?

01:39.024 --> 01:40.650
Yeah, he's got his dad's bladder.

01:40.651 --> 01:42.693
Speaking of which,
I'll see you upstairs.

01:43.821 --> 01:44.987
Oh.

01:44.988 --> 01:46.531
Hey, Eric.

01:46.532 --> 01:47.865
Hey.

01:47.866 --> 01:49.700
Um, great news.

01:49.701 --> 01:51.077
I tracked down that sheet music

01:51.078 --> 01:53.079
for that Oasis song
you were looking for.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.623
Oh. You did not have to do that.

01:55.624 --> 01:57.041
Oh, it's no big deal.

01:57.042 --> 01:58.459
That'll be $300.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.044
Seems steep.

02:00.045 --> 02:01.429
Is that before or after

02:01.432 --> 02:04.173
the you've-got-
my-brother's-heart discount?

02:04.174 --> 02:05.800
Uh, well played.

02:05.801 --> 02:08.845
So, um, what happened last night?

02:08.846 --> 02:10.429
You chicken out or something?

02:10.430 --> 02:11.556
What are you talking about?

02:11.557 --> 02:13.599
The open mic. Uh, I saw Gary there.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.226
I figured you were gonna perform.

02:16.293 --> 02:17.627
Gary was there?

02:17.630 --> 02:19.188
Yeah, he poked his head in

02:19.189 --> 02:20.815
for a minute and then took off.

02:20.816 --> 02:23.359
I figured you told him about it.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.695
Uh, no.

02:25.696 --> 02:27.948
He must have... seen the flier.

02:30.159 --> 02:32.117
Yo, Colin!

02:32.120 --> 02:35.079
Mr. Squirrel said his
nuts are bigger than yours.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.416
Whatcha gonna do about it?

02:38.417 --> 02:41.544
Hey, Gare, about the open mic night,

02:41.545 --> 02:42.628
I wanted to talk to you about that.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.101
Where's Colin?

02:44.104 --> 02:46.341
I thought he... followed
you up the stairs.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.427
No, he was with you.
He was on the leash.

02:51.555 --> 02:53.347
Colin!

02:53.348 --> 02:54.808
Colin?!

02:56.308 --> 02:58.184
Colin!

02:58.187 --> 02:59.531
Here, boy!

02:59.534 --> 03:00.688
Colin!

03:00.744 --> 03:01.992
Colin!

03:02.772 --> 03:04.648
- Colin!
- Colin!

03:04.651 --> 03:06.145
Colin!

03:11.533 --> 03:13.534
- Colin!
- Colin?!

03:13.535 --> 03:15.369
Come on, man.

03:25.859 --> 03:28.132
You do know that the people
listening to the podcast

03:28.133 --> 03:30.635
in their cars won't be
able to see you, right?

03:30.636 --> 03:31.887
Very funny.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.939
- Hey.
- Hey, Eddie.

03:34.942 --> 03:36.390
What are you doing here so early?

03:36.391 --> 03:40.311
Oh, he generously offered
to watch your sister.

03:40.312 --> 03:42.563
I have to go record that podcast today.

03:42.564 --> 03:43.689
- Oh.
- Remember?

03:43.690 --> 03:46.226
The one about life after suicide?

03:46.229 --> 03:47.604
Yeah.

03:47.607 --> 03:50.361
I think it's really great
that you're doing that, Mom.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.546
Thanks, sweetie.

03:51.549 --> 03:52.878
You're gonna be amazing, D.

03:52.881 --> 03:55.324
Well, I'll settle for not
saying anything stupid.

03:55.327 --> 03:57.828
Uh, as your daughter,
I agree with that plan.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.671
Brooke's here.

03:59.674 --> 04:00.998
Hey, we still on for playing that song

04:01.000 --> 04:02.541
at Theo's birthday party next week?

04:02.542 --> 04:03.765
Uh, you know it.

04:03.768 --> 04:06.044
And you better practice,
because I'm bringing my "A" game.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.672
Bye-bye, Charlie Farley!

04:12.179 --> 04:14.679
Y-You're sure Katherine's
okay with you watching Charlie?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.430
Totally.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.266
She's been so supportive.

04:18.267 --> 04:22.228
Somehow, some way, we're getting there.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.813
Okay.

04:23.814 --> 04:25.314
And...

04:25.315 --> 04:28.150
how is Andrew and his incredible coif?

04:28.151 --> 04:30.570
His coif is great. He says hello.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.531
He is using his day off
to hear me talk about

04:33.532 --> 04:35.283
the most painful moment of my life.

04:35.284 --> 04:38.744
So, yeah, I'd say
things are pretty good.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.492
Hey, you.

04:40.495 --> 04:42.748
Can you believe this
is where we are now?

04:45.252 --> 04:47.044
Actually, I can.

05:12.154 --> 05:13.362
Hey, Mom.

05:13.363 --> 05:14.572
Hey, T.

05:14.573 --> 05:16.157
Ready for school?

05:16.158 --> 05:17.593
I thought Dad was taking me.

05:17.596 --> 05:19.577
No, uh, he's watching Baby Charlie.

05:19.578 --> 05:20.804
I'm driving you today.

05:20.807 --> 05:22.620
I thought Dad didn't like babies.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.968
Why would you think that?

05:23.971 --> 05:26.429
Because you guys said you
don't want any more babies.

05:28.045 --> 05:30.963
Uh... no. No, Theo.

05:30.964 --> 05:35.250
Dad just wants to be a
really great uncle to Charlie.

05:35.253 --> 05:38.398
You mean because Uncle Jon died
and Charlie doesn't have a dad?

05:40.891 --> 05:42.391
Something like that.

05:49.733 --> 05:51.233
I'm so sorry.

05:51.234 --> 05:53.694
I don't know how this happened.

05:53.695 --> 05:55.571
You went inside.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.989
I took off his leash.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.491
I thought he followed you in.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.465
And then I got a call from Eric.

06:00.468 --> 06:01.870
Huh.

06:02.828 --> 06:04.963
You know what, I don't
care about that right now.

06:04.966 --> 06:07.081
Let's just find Colin, okay?

06:07.084 --> 06:08.709
Who are you calling?

06:08.710 --> 06:09.835
Hey, Ed.

06:09.836 --> 06:10.920
Hey, man. What's up?

06:10.921 --> 06:12.380
It's Colin. He got out.

06:12.381 --> 06:14.215
What?! How?

06:14.216 --> 06:15.460
It doesn't matter how.

06:16.678 --> 06:18.554
Well, did you check the
deli around the corner?

06:18.557 --> 06:20.391
You know how much he
loves their pastrami.

06:20.394 --> 06:22.348
He's not there, man. He's not anywhere.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.141
I don't know what to
do. I'm freaking out.

06:24.142 --> 06:25.726
Can you come, please, to help me look?

06:27.813 --> 06:29.179
I can't.

06:29.182 --> 06:32.281
I'm watching Charlie all day
while D does that podcast.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.652
Right.

06:34.653 --> 06:36.195
Sorry. Gotta go.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.405
Wait. Gary.

06:37.406 --> 06:38.864
Hey, Gary?

06:41.410 --> 06:43.202
Hey.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.375
You'll never guess who
I ran into this morning.

06:46.378 --> 06:49.273
The couple that made the offer
on the house across the street.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.778
They were so uptight, and
all I could think of was,

06:51.781 --> 06:54.086
"We had sex in your walk-in closet."

06:54.089 --> 06:56.173
Morning, Grant.

06:56.174 --> 06:57.453
Um, hey.

06:58.133 --> 06:59.633
I just got some bad news.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.429
Gary's dog got out.

07:01.430 --> 07:03.139
Oh, no.

07:03.140 --> 07:04.515
Gary must be a mess.

07:04.518 --> 07:06.650
He is, especially 'cause
Colin gets so skittish

07:06.653 --> 07:08.560
around people he doesn't know.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.520
I should go.

07:09.521 --> 07:10.688
Keep me in the loop.

07:10.689 --> 07:11.680
Talk soon.

07:12.727 --> 07:14.186
Katherine.

07:14.189 --> 07:15.565
Everyone's gathered
in the conference room

07:15.567 --> 07:16.944
for the Dolwick meeting.

07:16.945 --> 07:18.117
Yeah, I'll be right there.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.197
Okay.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.758
These are amazing.

07:22.761 --> 07:24.201
Yeah, I guess they're okay.

07:24.202 --> 07:25.411
PJ, you are tripping.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.484
RISD would be crazy not to accept you.

07:27.487 --> 07:29.987
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.
Your mom's a great artist.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.668
Was Jon artistic?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.781
He was artistic at making deals.

07:34.784 --> 07:36.619
What else was he good at?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.755
Knowing when to stop asking questions.

07:38.758 --> 07:42.011
Look, PJ...

07:42.012 --> 07:44.346
I know how badly you
want to know about Jon,

07:44.347 --> 07:47.117
but until we get the
results of the DNA test,

07:47.120 --> 07:49.622
I don't... I don't want you
to get ahead of yourself.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.542
- One shallot, a pinch of cumin,
- Yeah, I know.

07:51.545 --> 07:54.021
a tablespoon of thyme,
two cloves of garlic...

07:54.024 --> 07:55.232
Okay. You know what?

07:55.233 --> 07:56.484
I'll be there in 10
minutes, do it myself.

07:56.485 --> 07:57.735
Oh, man! No!

07:57.736 --> 07:59.236
Um, hold on one second.

07:59.237 --> 08:00.649
Gary just texted me.

08:00.652 --> 08:03.324
Colin got loose. I
gotta go help find him.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.995
Albert, change of
plans. I'm gonna be late.

08:07.996 --> 08:09.997
I'll be in when I'm in.

08:09.998 --> 08:11.123
You're not going to work?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.709
Not until we find Colin.

08:14.044 --> 08:15.531
We have to help Gary.

08:15.534 --> 08:17.669
- I'll come, too.
- No. No, no.

08:17.672 --> 08:19.703
That... That... That's not a good idea.

08:19.706 --> 08:22.219
It's a great idea. We
need everyone looking.

08:23.109 --> 08:24.803
Look, I know you really want to do this,

08:24.804 --> 08:26.680
but Maggie knows you from therapy,

08:26.681 --> 08:29.558
and with Gary being
all upset about Colin,

08:29.559 --> 08:32.645
the last thing anyone needs right now

08:32.645 --> 08:34.438
is for you to be asking
a bunch of questions.

08:34.438 --> 08:35.481
So if we are gonna do this...

08:35.482 --> 08:36.695
Come on, guys!

08:36.698 --> 08:38.565
...which, apparently, we are,

08:38.568 --> 08:40.859
then I'm gonna need you to promise me

08:40.861 --> 08:44.907
that you are going to
keep your mouth shut.

08:44.910 --> 08:48.869
I'm an awkward teenager
battling depression.

08:48.870 --> 08:51.156
Keeping my mouth shut
is kind of my thing.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.792
Yeah. Coming.

08:57.813 --> 08:59.255
Hey. Come in.

08:59.256 --> 09:00.297
Is everything alright?

09:00.298 --> 09:01.925
Uh... yeah.

09:02.720 --> 09:03.887
What are you...

09:03.890 --> 09:06.600
I'm here to watch Charlie

09:06.603 --> 09:09.305
so that you can help find Colin.

09:09.308 --> 09:10.850
You said it yourself.

09:10.853 --> 09:13.600
He's scared of strangers,
and he knows you.

09:13.603 --> 09:15.145
I just didn't want to offer to help

09:15.146 --> 09:16.954
until I knew I could be here for sure.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.313
Katie, I...

09:18.316 --> 09:20.649
Gary's done so much for us.

09:20.652 --> 09:23.404
He really needs you to be
there for him right now.

09:23.405 --> 09:26.740
You know, with Gary...

09:26.741 --> 09:28.994
Jon was always the
one to play that role.

09:31.079 --> 09:32.581
But Jon's not here anymore.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.126
Just go find Colin.

09:42.757 --> 09:44.485
Just right down the street?

09:44.488 --> 09:45.732
- No?
- I haven't seen him.

09:45.735 --> 09:46.967
No? Okay.

09:46.970 --> 09:49.430
- Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

09:49.431 --> 09:50.598
Thanks.

09:50.599 --> 09:52.308
Uh, no one there has seen him,

09:52.309 --> 09:54.727
but I talked to the shelter in Boylston,

09:54.728 --> 09:57.146
and I gave him our numbers
just in case he turns up.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.359
Oh, my God.

10:04.195 --> 10:05.524
Hey.

10:05.527 --> 10:07.782
What are you people doing here?

10:07.785 --> 10:10.204
We're here to find a dog.
What are you doing here?

10:11.369 --> 10:12.412
I...

10:14.039 --> 10:15.998
I thought you were watching Charlie.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.696
Katherine is watching Charlie.

10:18.501 --> 10:19.710
Katherine who?

10:20.879 --> 10:22.421
I know.

10:22.422 --> 10:25.076
She volunteered the moment
she heard about your dog.

10:28.219 --> 10:29.553
Hey.

10:29.554 --> 10:31.423
Hey. Look at me.

10:33.569 --> 10:34.765
We're gonna find him.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.838
How long are we gonna stand here

10:38.841 --> 10:40.943
before someone tells me
who this random kid is?

10:40.946 --> 10:42.232
Oh. Right. Sorry.

10:42.233 --> 10:44.652
Hey, Gary, Maggie, this is my friend PJ.

10:44.653 --> 10:46.445
He's here to help, too.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.530
It's nice to meet you.

10:48.531 --> 10:50.407
Yeah, you too.

10:50.408 --> 10:52.493
I'm... I'm so sorry about your dog.

10:52.494 --> 10:54.287
My dog Sonny ran away when I was 7.

10:58.917 --> 11:00.292
Well, did you find him?

11:00.293 --> 11:01.794
- U-Uh...
- Yep!

11:01.795 --> 11:04.129
They found him still alive.
End of story. Everyone's happy.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.696
Okay, to cover more ground,

11:05.699 --> 11:08.256
uh, Rome, Regina, PJ,
you guys go on foot.

11:08.259 --> 11:10.594
Maggie, Gary, and I are
gonna go in Gary's car.

11:10.595 --> 11:13.008
And what happens if Colin
comes back while we're gone?

11:14.641 --> 11:16.433
New plan... someone should stay here.

11:16.434 --> 11:17.579
I'll stay.

11:17.582 --> 11:19.990
Unless you want me to come with you.

11:19.993 --> 11:22.147
No. No, you're right. You should stay.

11:23.525 --> 11:25.109
O... kay.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.063
I'll... keep calling shelters,

11:27.066 --> 11:29.110
and I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

11:29.113 --> 11:30.489
Okay.

11:32.367 --> 11:35.703
Alright, everyone, take a bag of bacon.

11:35.704 --> 11:38.288
Oh, that's smart. Some
snacks to keep us going.

11:38.289 --> 11:40.541
Nope. They're to help find Gary's dog.

11:40.542 --> 11:41.750
This half is.

11:41.751 --> 11:43.044
Nope.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.591
What's that?

11:49.592 --> 11:53.262
Uh, St. Jude. The patron
saint of lost causes.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.682
He sounds perfect for me.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.350
You nervous about the podcast?

11:58.351 --> 12:00.227
Yes.

12:00.228 --> 12:02.021
I just don't know what I'm gonna say.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.981
I, uh, haven't made sense of everything

12:03.982 --> 12:05.712
that's happened myself, so...

12:05.715 --> 12:08.360
Well, maybe you don't
have to make sense of it.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.155
Maybe you just have to share your story.

12:11.156 --> 12:13.449
Yeah.

12:13.450 --> 12:15.284
I wanted to speak at Jon's funeral,

12:15.285 --> 12:17.286
but I...

12:17.287 --> 12:18.685
I-I couldn't.

12:18.688 --> 12:21.248
I just, um...

12:21.249 --> 12:22.332
I wasn't ready.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.005
Did you speak at Debra's funeral?

12:29.338 --> 12:31.465
No.

12:31.468 --> 12:32.634
No, I didn't.

12:36.449 --> 12:38.834
Yeah, we're just looking for
this dog. His name's Colin.

12:38.837 --> 12:39.853
Have you seen him, by chance?

12:39.855 --> 12:41.872
- He would have been just, you know, around...
- Like, around here?

12:41.874 --> 12:44.978
Things with Maggie and Gary were
a little awkward back there, huh?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.899
They're probably just going
through the same growing pains

12:46.900 --> 12:49.141
we went through when we
first moved in together.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.938
I'm assuming you're referring
to my late-night binge cleaning.

12:51.941 --> 12:53.781
I like a clean bathroom
as much as the next man.

12:53.782 --> 12:55.074
I'm just saying there
was a lot of nudity

12:55.075 --> 12:56.492
not associated with sex.

12:56.493 --> 12:58.827
Hey, you guys! Wait up!

12:58.828 --> 13:00.287
What is s-she doing here?

13:00.288 --> 13:02.331
I texted her. She gets
off early on Mondays.

13:02.332 --> 13:04.124
- Isn't that great?
- Amazing.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.418
- Hey.
- Hey, hon. Good to see you.

13:16.304 --> 13:17.846
Oh, PJ, this is Sophie.

13:17.847 --> 13:19.227
Hey. Nice to meet you.

13:19.230 --> 13:20.475
Hi. Nice to meet you.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.394
You know who I'd like to meet?

13:24.395 --> 13:25.646
Colin.

13:25.647 --> 13:27.397
Let's keep moving.

13:29.526 --> 13:31.485
Oh, come on, dude!

13:31.486 --> 13:32.821
Get out of the way!

13:35.390 --> 13:38.536
S-So, about... earlier...

13:39.618 --> 13:41.508
....is everything okay
with you and Maggie?

13:43.164 --> 13:44.623
Yeah, it's fine. It's really good.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.542
Okay.

13:46.543 --> 13:50.071
Did she have something to
do with Colin getting out?

13:50.074 --> 13:53.340
She didn't not have
something to do with it.

13:53.341 --> 13:55.509
She took him off his leash.

13:55.510 --> 13:56.837
She answered a phone call

13:56.840 --> 13:59.430
when she should have been
paying attention to where he was.

14:00.765 --> 14:02.516
But it's really good.

14:04.769 --> 14:06.770
Oh. Stop sign.

14:06.771 --> 14:07.938
Never mind. All good.

14:07.939 --> 14:10.190
The ones with white trim are optional.

14:11.943 --> 14:12.943
Or not.

14:12.944 --> 14:14.236
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

14:19.977 --> 14:22.321
- We do not have time for this!
- Gary, it's gonna be okay.

14:22.324 --> 14:23.618
No, it's not, Ed!

14:23.621 --> 14:25.620
Colin's out there
somewhere, God knows where,

14:25.623 --> 14:27.548
and we're stuck here
with this s-stupid...

14:28.725 --> 14:30.458
What's the hurry, gentlemen?

14:30.461 --> 14:32.774
Uh, we just...

14:32.777 --> 14:34.899
we didn't see the stop sign, okay?

14:34.902 --> 14:37.175
I-I don't know why. We just...

14:37.176 --> 14:38.927
Officer, here's the deal.

14:38.928 --> 14:40.679
My friend's dog went
missing this morning.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.889
We can't find him anywhere.

14:41.890 --> 14:43.307
Now, I know he ran a stop sign.

14:43.308 --> 14:45.100
I saw him do it. I even
called him out on it.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.019
- Seriously?
- You can give him a ticket, Breathalyze him.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.437
Hell, you can even Tase him.

14:48.438 --> 14:49.439
- Ed!
- But whatever you do,

14:49.441 --> 14:50.480
you have to do it fast,

14:50.481 --> 14:52.762
'cause we need to be out of
here in the next five minutes.

14:55.737 --> 14:57.195
I have a bulldog at home.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.962
I don't know what I'd do without her.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.827
Drive safely.

15:06.623 --> 15:08.040
What was that?

15:08.043 --> 15:09.875
That's what Jon would have done.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.423
Yeah, but I...

15:18.426 --> 15:21.094
I just... I keep going over everything,

15:21.095 --> 15:23.764
our whole life together and...

15:23.765 --> 15:26.725
what I should have done differently.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.282
Were there signs?

15:28.285 --> 15:30.187
But the truth is, even after learning

15:30.188 --> 15:33.398
about Jon's past and his secrets,

15:33.399 --> 15:35.193
I-I still blame myself.

15:37.695 --> 15:40.133
I don't think that will ever go away.

15:40.136 --> 15:42.783
I want to thank you for
sharing your story, Delilah.

15:42.784 --> 15:44.284
I can't tell you how much

15:44.285 --> 15:47.162
hearing you helps other survivors.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.704
Well, thank you, Dr. Ashton.

15:49.707 --> 15:53.210
You and other people who've
gone through similar tragedies

15:53.211 --> 15:55.128
have helped us so much.

15:55.129 --> 15:57.089
It's just like you said in your book...

15:57.090 --> 15:59.876
this is a club no one
ever wants to join.

16:00.871 --> 16:03.122
But it couldn't be more welcoming.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.501
So true.

16:04.504 --> 16:06.188
Your situation is unique.

16:06.191 --> 16:09.432
You were pregnant when
all of this happened.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.145
Did Jon know he was going
to be a father again?

16:16.275 --> 16:17.609
Delilah?

16:21.990 --> 16:24.658
I, uh...

16:24.659 --> 16:26.516
No.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.173
No, no, he... he didn't know.

16:29.330 --> 16:31.415
But Charlie's been the...

16:35.712 --> 16:37.295
He would have loved her.

16:40.675 --> 16:42.175
I can't believe I just did that.

16:42.176 --> 16:44.063
What are you talking
about? You were great.

16:46.597 --> 16:47.597
D.

16:47.598 --> 16:49.141
What is it?

16:49.142 --> 16:51.018
Tell me.

16:51.019 --> 16:52.394
Hey. It's okay.

17:30.099 --> 17:32.351
Hi.

17:35.396 --> 17:38.273
I know. I know.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.068
Ooh, you don't know me.

17:42.068 --> 17:44.069
But...

17:44.072 --> 17:47.449
I am your...

17:49.777 --> 17:52.621
Actually, I don't know what I am to you.

17:52.622 --> 17:54.289
But I'm Katherine.

17:57.251 --> 17:59.977
I don't understand. Why
does this even matter?

17:59.980 --> 18:03.382
You either have a 150-pound
black dog or you don't.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.800
You don't.

18:04.801 --> 18:06.259
Thanks.

18:22.860 --> 18:23.985
Colin?

18:23.986 --> 18:25.445
Oh, my God!

18:27.573 --> 18:28.954
Hey! I'm sorry.

18:28.957 --> 18:30.742
I-I was just dropping
off that sheet music.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.863
I didn't know you were home.

18:34.122 --> 18:35.157
What's wrong?

18:37.641 --> 18:39.582
So, how do you know Rome and Regina?

18:39.585 --> 18:41.294
It's actually a funny story. I, uh...

18:41.295 --> 18:44.274
You two. Less talky, more walky.

18:44.277 --> 18:47.462
Ooh, bicycles! We should
use those to look for Colin.

18:47.465 --> 18:49.177
Well, too bad there's only two of them.

18:49.178 --> 18:50.971
That... That... That's perfect!

18:50.972 --> 18:52.347
We... We... We can split up.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.932
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Me too.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.268
I think that one adult
should go with each kid,

18:56.269 --> 18:57.644
you know, for... for safety.

18:57.645 --> 18:59.352
This way, PJ and I can go ahead,

18:59.355 --> 19:00.852
and you and, uh, Sophie

19:00.855 --> 19:02.482
- They're gone.
- Can go ahead...

19:02.483 --> 19:04.067
You gotta be kidding me.

19:04.068 --> 19:05.068
What the hell?!

19:05.069 --> 19:07.195
Relax. They're cute together.

19:07.196 --> 19:08.360
Let them have fun.

19:08.363 --> 19:10.626
Let's get this straight.
They are not cute together.

19:10.629 --> 19:12.827
And I definitely don't
want them having fun.

19:13.927 --> 19:16.453
So, now everyone else is out searching,

19:16.456 --> 19:19.958
and I'm not even helping
because Gary's so mad at me.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.293
Well, of course he's mad at you.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.923
You let his dog out on purpose.

19:22.926 --> 19:24.379
No, I didn't.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.063
Exactly.

19:26.066 --> 19:27.891
You made a mistake, Maggie.

19:27.894 --> 19:30.800
People make mistakes, even when
they have the best intentions.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.679
With Chloe, I...

19:34.223 --> 19:36.683
Look, there are things in my own life

19:36.684 --> 19:39.811
that I have had to...

19:39.812 --> 19:41.735
forgive myself for.

19:41.738 --> 19:44.566
And I'm not saying that it's easy.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.860
It is not.

19:46.861 --> 19:51.406
But you... you do the best you can.

19:51.407 --> 19:54.367
And that's all anyone can do.

19:54.368 --> 19:55.790
Thanks.

19:55.793 --> 19:58.876
You made me feel about 5% better.

19:58.879 --> 20:01.881
Well, I will take it.

20:01.884 --> 20:03.766
Sorry to break up the party.

20:05.296 --> 20:07.352
I just came to get Mr. Squirrel here,

20:07.355 --> 20:09.881
'cause, you know, my dog's missing.

20:09.884 --> 20:11.218
Uh, I should probably go.

20:11.219 --> 20:12.391
You think?

20:13.971 --> 20:15.860
Okay.

20:15.863 --> 20:18.108
Alright, man, thanks for dropping by.

20:18.111 --> 20:19.765
I've been calling every single shelter

20:19.768 --> 20:20.768
and animal hospital...

20:20.771 --> 20:22.894
What is he doing here?

20:22.897 --> 20:25.106
He was just dropping
off this sheet music.

20:25.107 --> 20:26.858
Okay, maybe I'm not being clear.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.151
What is he doing in our life?

20:28.152 --> 20:30.063
He's not "in our life."

20:30.066 --> 20:31.780
Actually, you're right.
He's not in our life.

20:31.781 --> 20:32.821
He's just in your life.

20:32.824 --> 20:34.505
But you have him over to our apartment.

20:34.508 --> 20:36.076
And you were on the phone
with him this morning,

20:36.077 --> 20:37.410
and I'm pretty sure
you saw him yesterday

20:37.411 --> 20:38.774
when he gave you that flier.

20:38.777 --> 20:40.111
You know what the worst part is?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.996
For some reason, you're
hiding it all from me.

20:41.999 --> 20:43.333
It's not that I'm hiding it.

20:43.334 --> 20:46.086
It's... It's... hard to explain.

20:46.087 --> 20:47.258
Try!

20:47.261 --> 20:50.088
After all the stuff that
happened with my mother,

20:50.091 --> 20:52.384
I guess I...

20:52.385 --> 20:54.594
I-I just...

20:54.595 --> 20:56.012
I miss Chad, okay?

20:56.013 --> 20:57.806
And Eric is helping you with that?

20:57.807 --> 20:59.182
I don't expect you to understand.

20:59.183 --> 21:00.308
You didn't understand about the psychic.

21:00.309 --> 21:02.185
That's because none of that is real!

21:02.186 --> 21:03.876
Wow. Tell me how you really feel.

21:03.879 --> 21:05.562
Okay, you want to
know how I really feel?

21:05.565 --> 21:06.516
I thought watching your mother

21:06.518 --> 21:08.815
try to replace your brother
with a complete stranger

21:08.818 --> 21:10.402
was the most pathetic
thing I'd ever seen,

21:10.403 --> 21:12.028
until I saw you do it.

21:19.453 --> 21:20.746
You know what?

21:22.830 --> 21:27.305
I am sorry I lost your dog.

21:27.308 --> 21:29.462
But don't make me want to leave, too.

21:43.894 --> 21:46.337
You know those are all
the same flavor, right?

21:47.963 --> 21:50.857
Yeah, I just don't eat the white ones.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.736
- You want them?
- Sure.

21:52.737 --> 21:54.438
Hey, Patrick!

21:54.441 --> 21:56.532
- Who's that?
- Hey, Pat.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.035
Yeah, that's... that's my dad.

22:00.036 --> 22:02.454
- I'll be right back.
- Oh.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.751
Hey, pal. What are you doing?

22:04.754 --> 22:07.208
Nothing. We're just, uh, helping
some friends find a missing dog.

22:07.209 --> 22:08.376
Oh.

22:08.377 --> 22:10.545
Is that the girlfriend
you were telling me about?

22:10.546 --> 22:11.589
Um...

22:13.470 --> 22:14.846
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.

22:14.849 --> 22:16.665
You should invite her to dinner.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.011
Mom and I would love to get to know her.

22:18.012 --> 22:19.012
No. She can't.

22:19.013 --> 22:21.056
Look, we really need to find the dog.

22:21.057 --> 22:22.098
We gotta go.

22:22.099 --> 22:24.142
Okay. Good luck.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.310
I'll see you back at home.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.436
Okay.

22:35.404 --> 22:37.579
Aw. Did you see that?

22:37.582 --> 22:40.367
Saw it, hated it,
pretending it never happened.

22:43.644 --> 22:45.019
Let's go.

22:45.022 --> 22:46.834
- I'm sorry... what's your address?
- What?

22:46.837 --> 22:49.516
1031 Teplow Street. You can't miss it.

22:49.519 --> 22:51.795
There's a huge animal mural
on the side of the building.

22:51.796 --> 22:53.076
Great. We'll be right there.

22:54.168 --> 22:56.076
That was a shelter. I
think they found Colin.

23:05.643 --> 23:07.477
Um... sorry about that.

23:07.478 --> 23:10.719
I would have introduced you,
but he's super embarrassing.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.024
Well, then, I bet he'd get
along great with my mom,

23:13.025 --> 23:14.985
because she lives to embarrass me.

23:18.823 --> 23:21.324
Rome told me about your dad.

23:21.325 --> 23:22.798
I'm so sorry.

23:24.954 --> 23:26.149
Thanks.

23:28.082 --> 23:29.709
What was he like?

23:31.176 --> 23:33.761
He was perfect.

23:33.764 --> 23:36.474
On the... On the surface, anyway.

23:36.477 --> 23:39.676
But now I know that underneath it all,

23:39.677 --> 23:41.220
he was in a lot of pain.

23:43.806 --> 23:45.348
Thanks for asking about him.

23:45.349 --> 23:46.725
None of my friends ever do.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.853
It's probably 'cause they
think it'll be too awkward.

23:49.854 --> 23:51.271
I don't mind awkward.

23:53.801 --> 23:55.844
These were my dad's favorite.

23:55.847 --> 23:57.626
He and I kind of had this little thing

23:57.629 --> 24:00.547
where I would eat the pink ones
and he would eat the white ones,

24:00.550 --> 24:02.266
even when we weren't together.

24:02.269 --> 24:05.450
So sometimes, like, when he'd work late,

24:05.453 --> 24:06.619
when he came home,

24:06.620 --> 24:08.913
he would leave the pink
ones for me to find,

24:08.914 --> 24:11.499
so that I always knew that
he was thinking about me

24:11.500 --> 24:13.002
even when he wasn't there.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.696
I-I know it sounds dumb,

24:18.699 --> 24:21.885
but it's just something
that we shared together.

24:21.886 --> 24:24.012
That's... That's not dumb at all.

24:26.807 --> 24:29.673
I'd like nothing more
than to tell people

24:29.676 --> 24:32.020
what I've done and own my mistakes.

24:32.021 --> 24:33.730
But I can't do that.

24:33.731 --> 24:36.399
Listen, I get it. You've
been through so much.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.526
I'm just... just trying
to do the best I can

24:38.527 --> 24:39.946
to protect the kids.

24:39.949 --> 24:42.490
People... People... they
lie all the time, Delilah.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.159
I mean, at least you have a good reason.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.536
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

24:50.498 --> 24:52.583
Sometimes I worry that I'm not.

25:02.051 --> 25:04.385
You okay?

25:04.386 --> 25:06.262
Yeah. Yeah, I just...

25:09.011 --> 25:11.142
I haven't really told
you everything, either.

25:15.397 --> 25:18.316
I know I said that Debra
died three years ago.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.527
Truth is...

25:21.737 --> 25:23.321
...she's still alive.

25:32.902 --> 25:35.180
You know, it was a night
just like any other night.

25:35.183 --> 25:37.917
I-I remember she was
excited about this,

25:37.920 --> 25:41.047
uh, navy pea coat she ordered.

25:41.048 --> 25:42.966
It was supposed to come the next day.

25:42.967 --> 25:46.261
And then...

25:46.262 --> 25:48.555
right around, you know, bedtime,

25:48.556 --> 25:50.274
she said that she wasn't feeling well.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.726
And then in the morning...

26:00.025 --> 26:01.609
...she didn't wake up.

26:05.698 --> 26:10.285
After the stroke, they
said that she was gone.

26:10.286 --> 26:11.536
that I'd lost her.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.085
But there was this one neurologist

26:19.086 --> 26:21.921
that said that Debra had
a 1% chance of waking up.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.803
I live inside that 1%.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.346
I have to.

26:33.988 --> 26:36.156
I don't expect anyone to understand.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.452
That's why I lie about it.

26:38.455 --> 26:41.024
'Cause, uh...

26:41.025 --> 26:44.360
...sometimes just...

26:44.361 --> 26:47.488
lying is the only way that
I make it through the day.

26:47.489 --> 26:50.074
I do understand.

26:50.075 --> 26:53.244
I lie so my kids can
get through their day.

26:58.876 --> 27:01.336
Hey, Zachary, come get your snack first.

27:01.337 --> 27:03.546
But don't eat food while
you're climbing, okay?

27:03.547 --> 27:04.924
Have fun.

27:06.508 --> 27:08.344
Oh, your baby is so cute!

27:09.845 --> 27:10.888
Thanks.

27:14.391 --> 27:16.601
Actually, she's not mine.
I'm watching her for a friend.

27:16.602 --> 27:17.853
Oh. Okay.

27:19.063 --> 27:20.605
Not a friend, exactly.

27:20.606 --> 27:21.981
She's the daughter my husband had

27:21.982 --> 27:24.192
with the woman he was sleeping with...

27:24.193 --> 27:26.165
who also happens to be a friend of ours.

27:27.696 --> 27:30.032
Zachary! Time to go!

27:35.579 --> 27:40.500
Don't let her or anyone
else judge you or me.

27:40.501 --> 27:42.043
We didn't do anything wrong.

27:50.496 --> 27:51.803
Here he is!

27:51.804 --> 27:53.471
That's him! Colin!

27:53.472 --> 27:54.931
Colin. Hey, dude.

27:54.932 --> 27:56.099
Look who's here.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.684
Look what I got. Huh?

28:01.832 --> 28:04.148
Yeah, this big guy came
in about a week ago.

28:09.196 --> 28:10.405
Yeah, this isn't him.

28:10.406 --> 28:13.298
It looks like him,
but, uh, it's not him.

28:13.301 --> 28:15.241
I'm sorry, pal.

28:19.039 --> 28:20.165
Thank you, though.

28:22.730 --> 28:26.794
But he told me that I was
more pathetic than my mom.

28:26.797 --> 28:28.032
He said that?

28:28.035 --> 28:30.299
I've never seen him this angry before.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.344
At least, not with me.

28:32.347 --> 28:33.639
Tell you what.

28:33.642 --> 28:35.966
We're gonna head back
to your place, regroup,

28:35.969 --> 28:37.515
and come up with a new game plan.

28:43.439 --> 28:45.773
Maggie, you and Gary are
gonna get through this.

28:48.569 --> 28:51.279
If we don't find Colin,
I don't know that we will.

28:59.830 --> 29:02.288
We'll make signs. We'll post online.

29:02.291 --> 29:03.875
When you first found
him, he was on the street,

29:03.876 --> 29:05.376
and that was October in Boston.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.586
It's gonna be okay.

29:06.587 --> 29:10.006
It's not gonna be okay.
Nothing is gonna be okay.

29:11.008 --> 29:13.301
We just got to face the facts, man.

29:13.304 --> 29:15.641
Six hours ago, I lost Colin.

29:17.844 --> 29:20.221
And now maybe I'm gonna lose them both.

29:20.224 --> 29:22.685
W-What are you talking about?

29:22.686 --> 29:23.854
Maggie.

29:25.272 --> 29:27.440
It feels like I'm losing Maggie.

29:33.030 --> 29:36.449
Hey. Listen, um, I-I
just wanted to apologize.

29:36.450 --> 29:39.285
I feel like I messed
everything up for you today.

29:39.286 --> 29:40.735
Not just today.

29:40.738 --> 29:43.001
When I was talking
about mistakes before,

29:43.004 --> 29:45.289
one of the biggest ones I've made is

29:45.292 --> 29:48.127
what I've done to you and your family.

29:48.128 --> 29:49.712
I've been causing problems

29:49.713 --> 29:52.298
since the moment I responded
to your mother's letter.

29:52.299 --> 29:54.342
Believe me, that was never my intention.

29:54.343 --> 29:57.178
So I-I just... I think it might be best

29:57.179 --> 30:00.849
if I'm not... in your life anymore.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.602
After we moved in together,
she said something,

30:04.603 --> 30:06.562
and I can't stop thinking about it.

30:06.563 --> 30:10.566
She said part of me saving her

30:10.567 --> 30:12.274
was because I couldn't save Jon.

30:13.362 --> 30:14.987
Now that Maggie doesn't need saving,

30:14.988 --> 30:17.114
I don't know what I'm
supposed to be for her anymore.

30:17.115 --> 30:19.826
I mean, I thought our greatest
challenge was beating cancer.

30:19.827 --> 30:22.955
At least... we were
fighting the same thing.

30:24.998 --> 30:26.666
Now we're...

30:26.667 --> 30:28.782
Now we're just fighting each other.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.128
Look, I get that things
were different before,

30:31.129 --> 30:33.965
but that doesn't mean
you can't change them now.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.844
It's never too late to
redefine your relationship.

30:40.222 --> 30:41.723
If anyone knows that, it's me.

30:44.601 --> 30:46.853
Let's go find that dog.

30:46.854 --> 30:47.938
Okay.

31:02.619 --> 31:04.037
Oh, God.

31:05.956 --> 31:07.999
Colin.

31:18.235 --> 31:19.985
I'll make posters.

31:19.988 --> 31:22.298
I mean, somebody must have seen him.

31:22.301 --> 31:24.179
Hey, I should probably get going.

31:24.182 --> 31:25.802
Thank you so much for today, man.

31:25.805 --> 31:27.143
No, thank you.

31:27.144 --> 31:29.395
And let me know if you find Colin.

31:29.396 --> 31:30.649
Hey.

31:33.317 --> 31:36.819
I ate all the pink ones,
so you can have what's left.

31:39.907 --> 31:41.657
It was nice to meet you.

31:41.658 --> 31:43.075
Yeah, you too.

33:48.952 --> 33:50.880
Gary, there's something
I need to tell you.

34:05.135 --> 34:06.427
Oh, baby!

34:06.428 --> 34:07.553
Ohh!

34:25.371 --> 34:26.781
What is it, buddy?

34:26.782 --> 34:28.282
I...

34:30.077 --> 34:31.744
Hold that thought.

34:31.745 --> 34:33.079
What's up, Rome?

34:33.080 --> 34:35.206
Hey, Gare? Can you head home?

34:35.206 --> 34:37.500
Your dog wants to see you.

34:37.501 --> 34:39.337
What? Really?

34:39.340 --> 34:42.013
Actually, I don't know. Maybe
he doesn't want to see you.

34:42.016 --> 34:43.282
But either way, he's here.

34:43.284 --> 34:45.661
PJ found him eating moo shu
in your building's trash room.

34:45.664 --> 34:48.329
The door must have closed
behind him after he ran in.

34:48.331 --> 34:49.719
Alright, we'll be right there.

34:51.175 --> 34:53.896
See? I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.272
Oh-ho!

35:04.694 --> 35:06.237
Where's my boy?

35:06.238 --> 35:07.488
Ohh!

35:07.489 --> 35:08.656
Who's that guy?

35:08.657 --> 35:10.491
Oh! My man!

35:10.492 --> 35:12.660
Buddy!

35:12.661 --> 35:14.274
There you are.

35:14.277 --> 35:15.477
Oh, I missed you.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.946
Hey, hey. Hey.

35:16.949 --> 35:20.916
Colin, hey, will you promise
to never do that again to Papa?

35:20.919 --> 35:22.670
Huh? Ever, ever? Please?

35:22.671 --> 35:24.463
Would you do that for me?

35:24.464 --> 35:26.298
Oh, you smell like garbage.

35:27.843 --> 35:29.657
Oh, man!

35:29.660 --> 35:31.451
Alright, people, I got
to say something here.

35:32.777 --> 35:36.235
Today was one of the worst,
awful, crap days of my life.

35:36.238 --> 35:38.072
It's also been one of
the most incredible.

35:39.312 --> 35:40.980
'Cause I am reminded that I have

35:40.981 --> 35:42.566
the greatest friends in the world.

35:44.484 --> 35:45.819
I love you.

35:48.822 --> 35:50.197
All of you.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.827
But you know who I love the most?

35:54.828 --> 35:56.537
- Yourself?
- Most days, yes.

35:56.538 --> 35:57.455
Not today.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.665
Today...

35:59.666 --> 36:01.005
it's "Saved By the Bell."

36:01.008 --> 36:02.383
New guy.

36:02.386 --> 36:04.960
He probably has a name. He may
have even mentioned it earlier.

36:04.963 --> 36:05.963
It's PJ.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.506
That's right. PJ.

36:07.507 --> 36:08.649
Thank you, PJ.

36:08.652 --> 36:09.967
You're a hero, man.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.260
- Happy to help.
- Yeah.

36:14.099 --> 36:15.219
- Yeah!
- Yay!

36:18.477 --> 36:20.186
Don't think I forgot about you.

36:20.187 --> 36:21.604
I didn't do anything.

36:21.605 --> 36:23.105
Are you kidding me?

36:23.106 --> 36:25.274
No way I get through
today without you. No way.

36:25.275 --> 36:28.611
You've had my back all... day... long.

36:28.612 --> 36:30.779
And that stuff you said
about Maggie and I...

36:30.780 --> 36:32.024
Hey!

36:32.869 --> 36:35.996
...redefining our relationship...

36:35.999 --> 36:38.125
it doesn't just apply to couples.

36:38.128 --> 36:40.671
It also applies to dudes.

36:40.674 --> 36:42.416
Thanks, dude.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.835
You're welcome.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.462
Come on.

36:46.463 --> 36:47.485
We got him.

36:50.425 --> 36:52.008
We should stop hugging.

36:52.011 --> 36:54.553
I remain determined to be the
one member of this friend group

36:54.554 --> 36:56.055
you haven't slept with.

36:58.892 --> 37:00.602
Ohh.

37:08.735 --> 37:09.876
Hey.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.404
Hey.

37:15.324 --> 37:16.575
I heard about Colin.

37:16.576 --> 37:17.952
I'm so glad they found him.

37:17.953 --> 37:19.579
Yeah, me too.

37:20.531 --> 37:21.822
Okay.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.235
Here you go.

37:29.256 --> 37:31.382
She's a doll.

37:43.853 --> 37:46.719
Before you head out, um,
I have something for you.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.399
Oh, if it's my money for babysitting,

37:48.400 --> 37:49.441
don't worry about it.

37:49.442 --> 37:51.944
My hourly rate is ridiculous.

37:51.945 --> 37:54.029
There hasn't really been a good time

37:54.030 --> 37:55.646
to give you this until now,

37:55.649 --> 37:57.658
but, uh...

37:57.659 --> 37:59.076
Jon left this for you.

38:04.113 --> 38:06.031
It's the Scotch set from his office.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.579
Yeah. I'm not quite
sure why he picked that.

38:10.005 --> 38:11.256
I am.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.563
After everything he's been
through today, how do I tell him?

38:19.566 --> 38:20.765
You don't.

38:22.559 --> 38:23.642
I do.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.771
Uh, you can just text me anytime.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.923
PJ's getting digits.

38:31.610 --> 38:32.852
Oh, no.

38:32.855 --> 38:35.902
PJ cannot get the digits.
Not even one digit.

38:35.905 --> 38:38.344
Okay, that's it. You have been
acting weird about them all day.

38:38.346 --> 38:40.214
What's going on?

38:40.217 --> 38:43.094
PJ's not just some random
kid I met at the hospital.

38:44.247 --> 38:46.457
He thinks he might be Jon's son.

38:48.376 --> 38:50.002
So do I.

38:55.884 --> 38:57.635
Back when Eddie was getting sober,

38:57.636 --> 38:59.368
I didn't want to drink in front of him.

38:59.371 --> 39:03.849
So sometimes, after a long day,
I would stop by Jon's office,

39:03.850 --> 39:05.601
and this was our thing...

39:05.602 --> 39:09.063
our chance to talk and share.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.524
I didn't know that.

39:12.525 --> 39:14.993
But I'm not surprised.

39:14.996 --> 39:18.344
I mean, Jon always said that
he saw a lot of himself in you.

39:21.433 --> 39:26.430
I always thought he and I
were so honest with each other.

39:26.433 --> 39:28.874
But I guess he wasn't
telling me the full truth.

39:28.875 --> 39:30.548
Yeah, well...

39:30.551 --> 39:32.751
he wasn't telling anyone the full truth.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.649
Today I did.

39:37.050 --> 39:38.217
What do you mean?

39:38.220 --> 39:41.001
I went to the park today,
and I ran into a mom

39:41.004 --> 39:43.222
who thought Charlie was my daughter.

39:43.223 --> 39:44.848
I didn't correct her at first.

39:44.849 --> 39:45.934
But then I did.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.446
I told her the real story

39:49.449 --> 39:52.439
of how Charlie and I are connected.

39:52.440 --> 39:55.901
And it felt good to say it out loud.

39:55.902 --> 39:58.195
It felt good not to lie.

40:00.573 --> 40:03.117
Delilah...

40:03.118 --> 40:06.370
you and I know...

40:06.371 --> 40:08.580
that Jon is not here

40:08.581 --> 40:11.860
because he couldn't share who he was.

40:11.863 --> 40:14.628
He thought keeping all
his dark secrets to himself

40:14.629 --> 40:15.922
was best.

40:18.091 --> 40:19.800
Obviously, it wasn't.

40:22.972 --> 40:25.298
What if we're doing the same thing?

40:25.301 --> 40:30.055
Making a huge mistake
by hiding our secrets.

40:30.058 --> 40:31.438
What are you saying?

40:33.790 --> 40:37.151
I'm starting to think that we
should tell the kids the truth.

40:44.032 --> 40:45.951
Gary, I need to talk
to you about something.

40:45.952 --> 40:47.786
Me first, please. Sit down.

40:47.787 --> 40:49.204
I need to say this.

40:51.754 --> 40:54.251
What I said to you
earlier was unforgivable.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.919
I know that.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.463
But please forgive me.

41:00.183 --> 41:03.429
Nothing you did today justifies
the way that I treated you.

41:03.432 --> 41:04.475
I b...

41:05.891 --> 41:07.619
I broke the rules.

41:09.350 --> 41:10.601
I'm so sorry.

41:10.602 --> 41:13.685
Oh, I'm sorry... for
Eric, for everything.

41:13.688 --> 41:14.704
How about this?

41:14.707 --> 41:18.440
How about we forget
everything that happened today?

41:18.443 --> 41:21.153
Colin's home. We're all together.

41:21.154 --> 41:23.430
We can go back to normal.

41:23.433 --> 41:25.862
Okay? It's okay. Every...
Everything's gonna be okay.

41:26.826 --> 41:29.578
No, Gary, it's not.

41:36.085 --> 41:38.545
Um...

41:38.546 --> 41:41.173
Eddie found this at the dog shelter.

41:41.174 --> 41:42.360
What is this? Huh?

41:42.363 --> 41:44.551
It's from a year ago.

41:44.552 --> 41:47.137
That's why he was on the
street when you found him.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.556
They've been looking
for him since last year.

42:01.530 --> 42:03.278
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

42:03.279 --> 42:04.927
- No. Colin's mine.
- I'm sorry.

42:04.930 --> 42:06.907
No, Colin lives here.

42:06.908 --> 42:08.391
This... This is his home.

42:09.410 --> 42:10.751
It's not fair.
