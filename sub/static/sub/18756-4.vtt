WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.171
- Lucy, it's here!
- Hmm?

00:03.204 --> 00:05.005
Uh, no, you open it.
- Yeah?

00:05.039 --> 00:07.075
- I can't. I can't look, yeah.
- Okay, okay.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.809
- Oh, nice.
- Oh, my.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.245
Wow, Lucy!
- Nice.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.980
- That's amazing.
- Thanks.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.483
- I can't believe
something you designed

00:15.516 --> 00:17.051
is gonna be on, like,
billboards and stuff.

00:17.085 --> 00:19.153
- Yup, yup,
and buses and t-shirts

00:19.187 --> 00:20.521
and those annoying,
like, pop-up ads.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.655
- Ah, I'm so proud of you.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.157
- Thanks.
- This is so cool.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.160
(pleasant music)

00:26.194 --> 00:30.064
*

00:31.765 --> 00:33.267
(computer whooshes)

00:33.301 --> 00:34.602
- Hey, Mom.
Hey, Dad.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.670
- Hey, Lucy,
glad you found a way

00:36.704 --> 00:39.340
to turn that $5,000 computer
into a telephone.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.341
(laughs)

00:40.374 --> 00:42.676
- Yeah...yes, I did.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.045
Um, I just wanted
to thank you guys

00:45.079 --> 00:47.281
for taking care
of my loan payment this month.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.549
Uh, I'm totally
gonna pay you back.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.017
- (laughs) Right.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.019
- No, really. No, I am.
I actually just landed

00:52.052 --> 00:54.188
a major new client.
I designed the poster

00:54.222 --> 00:56.023
for a pretty big
music festival.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.425
- They, uh,
pay you for that?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.393
- Of course they did.
Yeah, um...

00:59.427 --> 01:01.028
yeah, no, it's not
a lot of money,

01:01.061 --> 01:03.564
but it's exposure,
which is way more valuable

01:03.597 --> 01:04.732
for someone like me, so.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.434
- Sure.
I remember when I was

01:06.467 --> 01:08.369
making your student loan
payment, they asked me

01:08.402 --> 01:11.572
if it'd be cash, credit,
or exposure. (laughs)

01:11.605 --> 01:13.541
- Uh-huh.

01:13.574 --> 01:17.411
- When can we see you?
You haven't been home in ages.

01:17.445 --> 01:21.549
- Ah, wow, you know,
it's actually kind of crazy here

01:21.582 --> 01:23.251
with, uh, with work
and everything.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.085
- Surely you can take
a day off from the grind

01:25.119 --> 01:27.721
now that you
just saved $937.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.057
- Yes, I can.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.161
Yes, um...
what about this weekend?

01:33.194 --> 01:34.562
- Well, great.
Settled then.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.598
- Yay.
You look tired.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.073
(light music)

01:46.106 --> 01:49.243
*

01:49.277 --> 01:51.412
- Oh, wow.
Can't believe I finally

01:51.445 --> 01:54.682
get to meet your parents.
You never talk about them.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.485
- Yeah, with good reason.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.453
God, I'm really
dreading this.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.989
- Oh, I don't know.

02:02.022 --> 02:06.260
Seems like a pretty good...
deal to me.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.995
You got the money
for your loan,

02:08.028 --> 02:10.498
and all we have to do is spend
one night in this old house.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.567
(ominous wind blowing)

02:16.404 --> 02:19.373
(downtempo electronic music)

02:19.407 --> 02:20.374
*

02:20.408 --> 02:21.709
- Ah!

02:21.742 --> 02:25.145
*

02:25.179 --> 02:27.215
- (squeaks)

02:27.248 --> 02:28.782
*

02:28.816 --> 02:30.284
- (growls)

02:30.318 --> 02:32.720
*

02:46.434 --> 02:49.803
- No, you don't understand,
Josh, this is an evil place.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.240
There's a malevolent energy
swirling all around.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.475
- (scoffs)
Malevolent energy?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.245
Lucy, what are you
talking about?

02:57.278 --> 02:59.513
- Passive-aggressive activity.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.483
(ominous music)

03:02.516 --> 03:05.419
- Oh, ho ho!
There she is!

03:05.453 --> 03:06.654
- Hi, Mommy.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.089
- Oh, so good of you
to take the time.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.424
- Hi.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.560
- Well, hey, there.
- Hi there, Mr. Parker.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.262
- Ooh, firm handshake,
good eye contact.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.263
You've got the job!

03:15.296 --> 03:17.097
- Oh. (laughs)

03:17.130 --> 03:19.032
- Oh, you must be the Josh
we've heard so much about.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.033
- Guilty.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.201
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.670
- Guilty, huh?
- Yup.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.505
- Well, then I sentence you
to let me carry those bags.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.275
(laughter)

03:27.308 --> 03:29.343
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, I've got iced teas

03:29.377 --> 03:30.378
for everyone.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.514
- Mmm.
- Come on.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.416
- Your parents seem great!

03:35.449 --> 03:40.187
- Yeah, well, they're not.
They're super judgmental.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.389
(dramatic music)

03:41.422 --> 03:43.691
Oh, my God,
look, look, look!

03:43.724 --> 03:45.025
*

03:45.058 --> 03:46.294
- What?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.361
- My mom was just
up in that window,

03:47.395 --> 03:49.029
giving me a disapproving look.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.565
- Oh, that's
just foolish talk.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.534
It's probably just
a trick of the light.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.536
Here, I'll meet you
inside there.

03:55.569 --> 03:59.072
(spooky music)

03:59.106 --> 04:01.108
Ah, it's just nice
to get out of the city,

04:01.141 --> 04:02.476
I'll tell you that much.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.044
- Josh, Josh, look, look, look!
Look!

04:04.077 --> 04:05.713
- What?
- The picture.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.147
- I-I don't see
a picture.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.383
- Exactly.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.219
*

04:12.252 --> 04:15.489
This is the only picture
they have of me that I like,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.257
okay, and it's in there?

04:17.291 --> 04:18.626
- Oh, it's probably
just the wind.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.494
- The wind put it
in a drawer?

04:20.528 --> 04:23.096
Josh, come on, this is classic
passive-aggressive activity.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.065
- You smell that country air?
That's just...

04:25.098 --> 04:27.267
(sniffs) It's refreshing,
is what that is.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.736
- (groans) Josh!

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
- Ahh.
(sniffs)

04:33.674 --> 04:34.675
- (screams)

04:34.708 --> 04:36.677
(dramatic music flourish)

04:37.778 --> 04:39.246
- Oh.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.249
(light rock music)

04:42.282 --> 04:46.354
*

04:46.387 --> 04:47.355
- Okay.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.990
*

04:50.023 --> 04:52.092
(sighs) Okay.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.429
We should be safe
in here.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.297
(scary music)

04:57.331 --> 04:58.632
What the heck?

05:01.234 --> 05:03.136
Are you kidding me?
The Broke, Confused,

05:03.170 --> 05:05.473
Out of Control Kidz
Guide to Finances?

05:05.506 --> 05:06.974
This isn't mine.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.141
- Ah, it's probably
just the wind.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.010
- No, Josh, it was
moved here.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.945
They're trying to send me
a message.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.314
A message about-about
IRAs and 401(k)s.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.716
You can see it.
You can see it, right?

05:15.749 --> 05:19.987
- Hmm. All I see is a girl
who needs a vacation.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.624
- You think I'm crazy,
don't you?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.959
- Hmm.
Crazy adorable, maybe.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.661
- No, Josh!
Josh, listen, okay?

05:27.695 --> 05:29.497
This is real.
This is real and-and,

05:29.530 --> 05:32.366
and-and it's happening and I'm
gonna prove it to you!

05:32.400 --> 05:34.635
- Hey, hey, you're missing
the movie and the popcorn.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.537
What are you doing,
hiding away there?

05:36.570 --> 05:39.139
Wha--? Uh, who-who
the heck are these guys?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.340
(spooky music)

05:40.374 --> 05:41.475
- You want proof
my parents are dicks?

05:41.509 --> 05:42.476
- No.
- These guys are gonna

05:42.510 --> 05:44.011
get it for ya.
- Okay.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.345
- That's right, Luce,
we are experts

05:45.379 --> 05:47.314
in detecting
passive-aggressive activity.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.084
If it's in this house
we're gonna get it on tape.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.653
This stuff does everything.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.390
This one picks up sighs.
This picks up sarcastic remarks.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.225
This picks up eye rolls.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.160
This one picks up ghosts.
Don't worry about that one.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.663
- Lucy, is all this necessary?
And why is there a camera

06:02.696 --> 06:05.499
pointed at the toilet?
- Okay, Josh, please.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.334
- Switching to night vision!

06:07.367 --> 06:09.069
(electronic whoosh)

06:09.102 --> 06:11.338
- Lucy, we're-we're missing
all the fun, okay,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.340
so let's just you and me
go downstairs,

06:13.373 --> 06:16.076
watch the end of Saving
Mr. Banks with your folks.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.445
- Josh, Josh,
no, Josh, no.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.179
You have to stay until
we find something.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.514
Something concrete,
something you can't deny.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.550
- But I need to know
how they save Mr. Banks.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.084
- Josh.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.086
- Fine.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.422
(machines beeping)

06:28.456 --> 06:30.691
(movie music playing on the TV)

06:30.724 --> 06:32.460
- Look out, Mr. Banks.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.062
- Thanks, pal,
you just saved my life.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.697
*

06:36.730 --> 06:38.532
- Damn it.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.569
- (snoring)

06:44.004 --> 06:46.206
Hmm?
What?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.542
What time is it?
- 10:20.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.078
Still nothing.
You want to call it?

06:51.111 --> 06:55.048
- That's...
(coughs)

06:55.082 --> 06:56.550
Wait a minute.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.385
Wait, what is that?
What's on the table?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.587
Can you enhance that?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.388
- Ask and ye shall receive.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.156
(typing clacks)

07:03.190 --> 07:04.592
- How long has that breakfast
been there?

07:04.625 --> 07:07.461
- Let me just rewind here.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.664
*

07:10.698 --> 07:12.966
Three hours.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.936
Why would they put breakfast
out so early?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.404
- I will tell you why,

07:17.437 --> 07:18.939
so that I would
sleep through it

07:18.972 --> 07:20.641
and they could make jokes
about how long I slept,

07:20.674 --> 07:22.075
like, "Oh, nice of you
to join us,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.511
you lazy,
unsuccessful loser."

07:23.544 --> 07:26.647
This-this-this is proof.
Can you make me a copy of this?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.482
- Already done.
- (groans)

07:28.516 --> 07:30.618
Josh, hey. Josh, you want proof?
I got it right here.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.985
(dramatic music)

07:32.019 --> 07:33.987
Josh?

07:34.021 --> 07:35.422
*

07:35.455 --> 07:37.958
Josh?
(laughter)

07:37.991 --> 07:39.426
- Ah. Give him a second.
- For me.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.361
- That is not a...
- You give him half a second.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.596
- Aw, well, I tried.
- I know, he thought about...

07:42.630 --> 07:44.197
- He's running
a racket here.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.033
- A career in the arts.
- How 'bout Spanish?

07:46.066 --> 07:47.601
Can we use Spanish words
like "si"?

07:47.635 --> 07:49.002
- No, you can't use Spanish.
- No, of course not.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.971
(scary music)

07:51.004 --> 07:52.205
- Nice of you to join us.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.474
- Oh, the dead have
finally risen.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.376
- Yeah, look who's up
at the crack of noon there,

07:56.409 --> 07:57.511
sleepyhead.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.279
(laughter)

07:59.312 --> 08:02.650
- (whispering)
That's why you couldn't see.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.418
You're one of them.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.557
(pleasant music)

08:09.590 --> 08:11.124
- Yeah!
(both groan)

08:11.158 --> 08:12.960
- Gosh darn it,
that's three in a row.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.027
You're getting so good
at Bananagrams,

08:14.061 --> 08:15.495
it's losing its "appeal."

08:15.529 --> 08:16.797
- (laughs)
- (groans)

08:16.830 --> 08:18.666
I get it, "a peel."

08:18.699 --> 08:21.501
- Well, then I guess it's
a good thing we have to "split."

08:21.535 --> 08:23.070
(both groan)
- (laughs)

08:23.103 --> 08:24.805
- That's a good one!
- Terrible.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.473
- Oh, you two.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.341
Josh, do you want popcorn
for the road?

08:28.375 --> 08:29.376
- Ooh. Come on.
- Hmm, let me think on that.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.578
- Ooh, ooh.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.812
- Yes, please!
- Yes, of course..

08:31.845 --> 08:33.146
- I'll get it.
- I got it.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.583
(drumming on the table)
- Ah.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.750
- (sighs)
- Oh.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.586
Hey, you.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.688
What are you doing
out there?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.590
Whoa.
- I thought you were on my side.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.491
- Uh, I, I am on your side.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.326
- Are you? 'Cause it-it looked
like you spent the whole morning

08:46.359 --> 08:47.828
with my folks, laughing
and ganging up on me

08:47.861 --> 08:49.529
and making fun of me for not
coming down to breakfast.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.766
- Lucy,
we're just "Bananagraming."

08:52.800 --> 08:55.903
Not everything is, like,
a conspiracy against you.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.339
(ominous music)

08:59.372 --> 09:01.775
- Joshua, c-can, can I talk to
you upstairs for just a minute?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.110
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.444
- Yep.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.147
*

09:10.383 --> 09:11.451
(door closes)

09:11.484 --> 09:14.888
*

09:14.922 --> 09:17.324
(sighs)

09:20.794 --> 09:22.730
(crowd murmuring)

09:22.763 --> 09:26.133
Oh. All right, Christ, Jesus.
All right, okay.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.401
What the hell? Uh...

09:28.435 --> 09:32.806
Lu...Lucy?
Um, um...

09:32.840 --> 09:35.275
What-what's...
what's going on?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.477
- Mr. Greenberg, you stand
before us under suspicion

09:37.510 --> 09:39.312
of being
a parent sympathizer.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.615
- What? That's-that's,
that's ridiculous.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.316
- Is it, Mr. Greenberg?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.585
- Yes.
- Is it?

09:45.619 --> 09:48.588
I will prove that this man
not only attended meetings,

09:48.622 --> 09:51.659
but was found in possession
of parental literature.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.793
(all gasp)

09:52.826 --> 09:54.662
- What? Uh, uh, what?
Uh...

09:54.695 --> 09:57.264
- Mr. Greenberg,
who gave you this book?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.733
- (muffled)
Well, I don't remember.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.770
I-I don't remember.
(feedback screeches)

10:02.803 --> 10:04.237
- Was it this man?

10:04.271 --> 10:05.673
Shit.
(stammers)

10:05.706 --> 10:09.777
- Um, I-I-I would like to plead
the Third Amendment.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.111
- You want
to forbid soldiers

10:11.144 --> 10:12.412
from quartering
in private homes?

10:12.445 --> 10:16.283
- (stuttering)
Uh, the 12th Amendment.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.652
- You want to revise
presidential election proced...

10:18.686 --> 10:20.353
- You know the amendment
I'm trying to get to!

10:20.387 --> 10:23.156
- Mr. Greenberg,
who gave you this book?

10:23.190 --> 10:26.126
- No. I'm not gonna
name names,

10:26.159 --> 10:27.761
because this is a witch hunt,
and you know it.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.129
- Is it not true,
Mr. Greenberg,

10:29.162 --> 10:30.664
that my father gave you
this book?

10:30.698 --> 10:32.599
Is it not also true
that you have been posing

10:32.632 --> 10:34.868
as a loyal Lucy-ist,
all the while fraternizing

10:34.902 --> 10:37.170
and conspiring with the enemy
secretly?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.872
And is it not also true,
Mr. Greenberg,

10:38.906 --> 10:41.341
that you are in fact
a parent-loving pinko

10:41.374 --> 10:42.542
and a traitor?
- Okay, fine!

10:42.575 --> 10:44.377
It's true, I am!
(all gasping)

10:44.411 --> 10:46.546
I am! I did it!

10:46.579 --> 10:48.381
I went to some
of their meetings!

10:48.415 --> 10:50.650
And I listened
to what they had to say.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.054
And you know what?
It sounded pretty good.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.623
So maybe I am
a parent sympathizer,

10:56.656 --> 11:00.560
because I like your parents!
I like your parents.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.329
I don't know
why that's a crime.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.398
They're nice to me.
They gave me popcorn.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.701
They showed me
a very good movie

11:07.735 --> 11:11.204
that I will now never see
the ending of, all right?

11:11.238 --> 11:12.339
I'm not gonna spend money
just to see

11:12.372 --> 11:14.474
the last 14 minutes of it.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.677
No, I'm probably gonna end up
"Wikipedia-ing" the synopsis,

11:17.711 --> 11:19.312
like an animal!

11:19.346 --> 11:22.415
The point is your parents
are nice to me.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.552
And by the way,
they're nice to you, too.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.587
They did cover
your student loan payment,

11:27.620 --> 11:29.757
didn't they?
I mean, this whole time,

11:29.790 --> 11:33.360
the only person in that house
who hasn't been nice is you.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.696
(all gasping)

11:36.730 --> 11:38.665
That's cool.
Uh, yeah, you.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.902
This whole time you've been
pouting in your room, Eeyore.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.536
(crowd murmurs)

11:43.570 --> 11:45.572
Yeah.
Ever since we got here,

11:45.605 --> 11:48.275
you've been acting
really immature.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.744
- Really? Really, Josh,
I've been acting immature?

11:50.778 --> 11:52.612
Okay, that's great.
You've been acting like somebody

11:52.645 --> 11:54.414
who should suck my dick!
- Oh, Jesus.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.284
Jesus Christ, Lucy, that's...
- You know what?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.119
(bleep) all y'all can
suck my dick, all right?

11:59.152 --> 12:02.089
Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
You, (bleep) that guy.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.290
You, (bleep) eat me.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.591
- Can we talk about this?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.426
- What is there
to talk about?

12:06.459 --> 12:10.831
Okay? Surprise, surprise,
I'm on my own... as usual.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.771
- Wait, Lucy, I-I just...
Can you...?

12:17.805 --> 12:19.672
Okay, can I just...?
Can you guys move a little bit?

12:23.343 --> 12:25.445
- Wait, wait, Lucy, Lucy.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.614
Wait, what the...?

12:27.647 --> 12:30.984
Uh, Lu-Lucy!

12:31.018 --> 12:33.586
Lucy! Lucy!

12:33.620 --> 12:35.155
- Oh, is she in the attic?

12:35.188 --> 12:36.556
- Yeah, uh,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.125
is there, like, a string
that comes down, or...?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.893
- No, no, she takes it up
with her.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.494
- Hmm.
- I'd settle in.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.264
Could be a while.
- (sighs)

12:44.297 --> 12:45.632
- Lu-Lucy?

12:45.665 --> 12:49.369
Luce, talk to me, please.
Say something.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.115
(wistful music)

13:02.149 --> 13:05.285
*

13:05.318 --> 13:07.720
(door creaks)

13:18.365 --> 13:21.001
(short laugh)

13:23.370 --> 13:25.805
*

13:39.987 --> 13:42.956
(pleasant music)

13:42.990 --> 13:45.392
*

14:01.875 --> 14:03.877
(chuckles)

14:08.515 --> 14:10.517
(laughs)

14:13.887 --> 14:16.890
(blows horn)

14:18.892 --> 14:21.861
- Queen Lucy?

14:21.895 --> 14:24.097
- Puffala!

14:24.131 --> 14:26.333
- Oh, how I missed you so!
- (laughing) Hi!

14:26.366 --> 14:28.335
(both laughing)

14:28.368 --> 14:30.037
- Your Majesty.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.272
- Ruffala!
Picklepop!

14:32.305 --> 14:34.441
- You've returned!

14:34.474 --> 14:36.376
We haven't seen you
in 20 years,

14:36.409 --> 14:38.011
not since the time
you ran away

14:38.045 --> 14:39.879
because your parents
threw out your Play-Doh statues.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.514
- I'll never forget
that night.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
We howled at the moon and...

14:43.416 --> 14:46.253
and did the wild monster dance
all night long!

14:46.286 --> 14:50.223
- Right, the wild monster dance!
Remember, guys?

14:50.257 --> 14:53.393
all:
* Grakka gundda grakka snools

14:53.426 --> 14:56.563
* No more parents
no more rules *

14:56.596 --> 14:58.398
(laughter)

14:58.431 --> 15:00.934
- Oh, ha ha ha!

15:00.968 --> 15:02.902
So, what brings you
back to us?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.071
- I ran away again.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.940
- (laughs)
Wait, no, seriously?

15:06.974 --> 15:09.309
- Come, let's travel
to the land of Biddle Bop

15:09.342 --> 15:11.144
and eat 100 jelly pies!

15:11.178 --> 15:13.413
- Um, I totally would,

15:13.446 --> 15:15.882
but my nutritionist
has me off pies.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.317
- And Biddle Bop?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.818
With the construction
they're doing on the bridge...

15:18.851 --> 15:20.954
ugh, that's
a four-hour ordeal.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.389
- I don't understand.
What happened to you guys?

15:22.422 --> 15:23.556
You changed.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.992
- We didn't change, Lucy,
we just,

15:25.025 --> 15:28.261
you know, grew up,
I guess.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.430
Uh, wait, so who are you
running away from again?

15:30.463 --> 15:31.965
- My parents.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.833
- Jim and Carolyn?
They're still alive?

15:33.866 --> 15:36.903
Oh, that is such a blessing.
How are they?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.471
- They're driving me crazy
is how they are.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.273
Look, look at this stupid book
they gave me.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.310
- Ooh, you're in for a treat.
That book changed my life.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.677
- What? No, that-- No, no.

15:44.711 --> 15:45.945
Listen, that's-that's
not the point.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.614
I don't need them
to save me.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.450
If I want to do an IRA, then
that-that's my business, right?

15:50.483 --> 15:53.520
- "Do an IRA"?
Do you even know what an IRA is?

15:53.553 --> 15:56.456
- Uh-huh, it's, like,
um, a savings bond.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.258
- Do you want me
to explain it to you?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.327
- No.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.528
Okay.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.431
- All right, so,
an IRA is an account

16:04.464 --> 16:07.367
where you set aside a portion
of your pre-tax income...

16:07.400 --> 16:09.202
up to 5,500 bucks a year,

16:09.236 --> 16:12.105
or $6,500
when you hit 50.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.507
That money comes
right off your taxable income,

16:14.541 --> 16:16.943
which means...
you guessed it...

16:16.976 --> 16:20.813
instant tax refund.
That's free money right there.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.183
- Um, okay, I guess
that makes sense.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.152
- You know what
doesn't make sense?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.987
Running away
from your problems,

16:28.021 --> 16:30.623
because they're never
really out there, are they?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.359
They're in here.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.027
- Oh, that's
a Hertzberg line.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.495
I know that's
a Hertzberg line.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.496
He used that one on me.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.864
- Who's Hertzberg?

16:37.897 --> 16:39.066
- Oh, he's my therapist.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.500
I mean, he was mine.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.170
Now we all use him.
He's amazing.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.404
I mean, I'm gay, obviously.
- Right.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.473
- But just saying that
was impossible

16:46.506 --> 16:48.841
before I went to him...
just saying it!

16:48.875 --> 16:52.179
And now, because of him,
I know that that's not all I am.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.581
Yes, I'm gay,
but I'm also a friend,

16:54.614 --> 16:57.084
a monster, a-a Christian,
a brother.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.418
- A damn good one, too.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.919
- Aw, thanks, Puff.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.988
- Lucy?
Talk to me.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.923
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's...

17:03.956 --> 17:06.059
Um, that's... that's
my boyfriend Josh.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.328
- He sounds worried.
- And hot.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.997
- Muffala!
- I know, I'm terrible.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.232
(laughs)

17:12.265 --> 17:14.234
- Lucy... (sighs)
I know what it's like

17:14.267 --> 17:16.403
to hate your parents.
I get it.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.539
My dad was a monster,
but as far as I see it,

17:19.572 --> 17:21.208
you got two choices.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.376
You can run away and scream
and throw tantrums

17:23.410 --> 17:25.378
until you've scared
everyone else in your life away

17:25.412 --> 17:28.047
or... or you can grow up.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.584
Oh, and next time
you visit your folks,

17:31.618 --> 17:33.420
definitely pop
one of these.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.888
It's one of my Xanax.
Every time I go home

17:35.922 --> 17:37.857
I take one, like, an hour
before I get even there

17:37.890 --> 17:39.892
so it has time to kick in.
(chuckles)

17:39.926 --> 17:41.394
It's monster size,
so I don't know,

17:41.428 --> 17:43.496
take a half, I guess.
Whatever.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.200
- Thanks, Puffala.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.901
- (laughs)
You got it.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.237
(upbeat music)

17:50.270 --> 17:51.571
- Hey, can I drink
with this?

17:51.604 --> 17:52.939
- Short answer, no.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.874
Long answer,
depends on the holiday.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.809
(both laughing)

17:56.843 --> 17:58.077
*

17:58.111 --> 17:59.279
- Bye, guys.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.813
- Bye-bye! (laughs)
- Bye-bye now.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.990
- Hey.
- Hi. Yeah.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.892
Uh, guess we should
probably get going.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.794
- Josh, wait.
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.663
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.498
You were totally right,
okay?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.766
I like to think I have
my shit together,

18:19.799 --> 18:21.168
and then I spend
ten minutes with them

18:21.201 --> 18:22.769
and I-I feel like
I'm a kid again,

18:22.802 --> 18:25.138
like a-a stupid kid
who wants their parents

18:25.172 --> 18:26.806
to say she's good enough.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.609
- Thank you for coming.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.678
- Thanks, Daddy.
- (chuckles)

18:31.711 --> 18:33.480
I suppose to you've got to get
back to the office,

18:33.513 --> 18:35.014
or is Monday not a workday
for you?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.683
(laughs)
- Oh, now, come on,

18:36.716 --> 18:39.686
she's gotta go to work
on her little poster thing.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.521
- Um, great!

18:41.554 --> 18:44.023
Well, thank you both so much
for having us.

18:44.056 --> 18:47.527
- Uh, you do know that it's not
a little poster thing, right?

18:47.560 --> 18:50.863
- Josh, it's not worth it.
- No, no, it's a very big deal.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.165
I mean, this is gonna be
on billboards.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.766
Something she did is
gonna be on billboards

18:53.800 --> 18:55.535
and in newspapers, the...

18:55.568 --> 18:58.371
The Reader, Time Out,
maybe even the Tribune.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.939
- Hmm.
- We only get USA Today.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.041
- Oh, my God. Well,
then I guess you're missing out.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.710
- Hmm.
- Yeah. Oh, Josh,

19:03.743 --> 19:05.712
you don't want to forget
your popcorn for the road.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.046
- Actually, you know what?

19:07.079 --> 19:10.082
I seem to have lost my appetite
for popcorn.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.487
(Alvvays' "Archie Marry Me")

19:14.521 --> 19:16.122
Boy, you were right,
your parents sure are

19:16.155 --> 19:17.524
passive-aggressive.
- Josh. Josh, wait.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.625
- What? What? Oh.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.893
Oh, mmm. Mmm.

19:20.927 --> 19:21.894
That's nice.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.396
- I love you.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.898
- (stuttering)
I-I love you too.

19:25.932 --> 19:29.636
*

19:29.669 --> 19:32.705
- Hey, um...

19:32.739 --> 19:33.873
can you drive?
You wouldn't believe

19:33.906 --> 19:35.575
how much Xanax
I just took just now.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.076
- Oh. Yeah, no,
not at all.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.845
Let's do it.
- Okay.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.848
- * You've expressed
explicitly *

19:41.881 --> 19:46.419
* Your contempt for matrimony

19:46.453 --> 19:49.756
* Hey, hey

19:49.789 --> 19:54.461
* Marry me, Archie

19:55.528 --> 19:59.432
- I am a sex addict.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.000
There, I-I said the words.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.704
It took... it took ten years,
but there-there it is.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.106
It...
I'm addicted to sex.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.442
There have been
other women.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.778
Um, one of Susan's friends
from work.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.714
I have not been safe.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.115
- Have you told your wife?

20:16.148 --> 20:17.917
- No.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.952
- What's the worst
that could happen?

20:19.986 --> 20:21.921
- She could leave me.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.856
- Like your mother
left your father.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.626
- Oh, my God!
Another breakthrough!

20:26.659 --> 20:29.862
Hertzberg, you're a genius.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.598
- Unfortunately,
we're out of time.

20:31.631 --> 20:35.635
- (roars)

20:37.970 --> 20:40.340
*

20:53.753 --> 20:57.657
* Too late to go out

20:57.690 --> 21:01.828
* Too young to stay in

21:01.861 --> 21:05.898
* They're talking about

21:05.932 --> 21:07.834
* Us living in...

21:11.304 --> 21:13.105
