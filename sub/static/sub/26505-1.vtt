<i>I keep having this dream.</i>

01:23.839 --> 01:25.604
<i>The kind
that seems so real</i>

01:25.870 --> 01:29.035
<i>and becomes so terrifying
you wake up screaming.</i>

01:32.071 --> 01:35.336
<i>Only you realize
the dream isn't over.</i>

01:35.804 --> 01:39.167
<i>You're lying there,
trapped between two realms,</i>

01:39.736 --> 01:42.634
<i>unsure of what's real
and what's not.</i>

01:47.005 --> 01:48.937
<i>If you can't wake up
from the nightmare,</i>

01:49.772 --> 01:51.168
<i>then maybe
you're not even</i>

01:51.502 --> 01:52.668
<i>asleep.</i>

03:29.600 --> 03:32.399
Everybody listen up! Hands up
and get down on the floor.

03:32.667 --> 03:33.730
Back away!

03:33.732 --> 03:35.664
Step away from the register.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.065
- Let's go, let's go. Get down, get down.
- What did I say?

03:37.067 --> 03:38.399
Get down.

03:38.401 --> 03:39.697
Keep your head
on the ground.

03:39.699 --> 03:41.631
- <i>Sawatdee ka.</i>
- Keep your head down.

03:41.966 --> 03:43.865
Shut up and get down.

03:43.867 --> 03:46.099
It'll be nice and easy if you
manage not to fuckin' piss me off!

03:46.101 --> 03:48.366
Where do you think you're going?
Get your ass on the floor.

03:48.368 --> 03:50.332
Look at the ground.
Stay down.

03:50.334 --> 03:51.697
You over there, sit down.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.965
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.766
Stay down, heads down!

03:56.032 --> 03:58.097
Hey! Hey!

03:58.666 --> 03:59.831
Did you just
press the alarm?

03:59.833 --> 04:01.629
Don't fucking lie to me!

04:01.631 --> 04:02.830
No.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.365
What, you think I don't see you?
Come on.

04:06.699 --> 04:08.396
On the floor, bitch!

04:08.398 --> 04:09.962
Jewel, clock's ticking!

04:09.964 --> 04:12.331
You, get up.
Up and out.

04:12.799 --> 04:14.962
Down, on the ground. Down.

04:15.265 --> 04:17.164
Unless you want to end up
like your friend, stay down.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.863
I'll fucking shoot you.

04:18.866 --> 04:21.197
Mr. Manager. Get up.

04:22.031 --> 04:23.764
Get up.
You speak English?

04:24.166 --> 04:26.531
Yes? All right!
We're gonna be good friends.

04:26.965 --> 04:28.831
Get the keys
to the safe, now.

04:29.597 --> 04:30.730
Get the key.

04:30.732 --> 04:32.129
Is that your family
right there?

04:32.131 --> 04:33.695
Do you want
to see 'em again?

04:33.697 --> 04:35.963
Then get
the fucking keys, now!

04:36.664 --> 04:39.394
Bank robbing is fun, huh?

04:39.396 --> 04:41.261
Think of the story
you'll have to tell.

05:09.963 --> 05:11.795
All right.
Let's go for a walk.

05:12.028 --> 05:13.328
Walk!

05:13.330 --> 05:14.760
That's right,
put your head down.

05:14.762 --> 05:16.661
<i>Kob khun ka!</i>

05:22.629 --> 05:23.961
Come on!

05:25.696 --> 05:27.059
Get in!

05:27.061 --> 05:29.361
You move and I'm putting
a bullet in your head.

05:37.829 --> 05:39.427
Oh, you think you're sneaky?

05:39.429 --> 05:40.795
You think I don't see you?

05:40.797 --> 05:42.828
Oh, you don't
speak English now, huh?

05:42.830 --> 05:44.694
Put your hands out
where I can see 'em.

05:48.394 --> 05:49.926
We had a deal, bitch.

05:49.928 --> 05:51.726
You don't move...

05:51.728 --> 05:53.927
...and I won't blow your brains

05:53.929 --> 05:55.861
all over your little
jackie sundress.

05:59.594 --> 06:01.493
Oh. I get it.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.127
You think you're
smarter than me.

06:04.394 --> 06:05.425
Is that what it is?

06:06.593 --> 06:09.158
You know, I could've gone to
college too if I wanted to.

06:16.695 --> 06:17.928
Put your head down.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.492
- Please don't kill me.
- Put your fucking head down.

06:22.494 --> 06:24.259
Please don't kill me,
please don't kill me.

06:30.462 --> 06:33.158
Please don't kill me. Please.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.091
Hey!

06:43.294 --> 06:45.425
They teach
you that in school?

06:46.692 --> 06:48.157
That's just physics.

06:52.559 --> 06:55.025
Look at him.

06:55.727 --> 06:56.791
I said look at him.

06:56.793 --> 06:58.491
- No.
- You don't speak English?

06:59.024 --> 07:00.257
Look at him.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.923
You see what you did?

07:12.592 --> 07:16.491
Remember this: bad decisions have a
way of coming back to haunt you.

07:29.757 --> 07:31.123
Stay there.

07:34.891 --> 07:36.255
Yeah, good luck with that.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.256
You too,
girlfriend, get up.

07:39.258 --> 07:41.090
- Hey, we gotta go.
- Where are we going?

07:41.092 --> 07:44.090
- We don't need hostages.
- Cops are outside. We need collateral.

07:44.092 --> 07:45.822
- Walk.
- Quick. Walk.

07:45.824 --> 07:47.389
Move it along,
move it along.

07:47.391 --> 07:48.855
Go. Walk.

08:00.858 --> 08:02.855
- Don't move.
- Whoa, whoa! Shit!

08:02.857 --> 08:04.321
- Don't move.
- Put the gun away.

08:04.323 --> 08:06.288
- Both hands on the wheel.
- What the hell are you doing?

08:06.290 --> 08:07.655
Get your ass in the car.

08:07.657 --> 08:09.655
You listen to exactly
what I tell you

08:09.657 --> 08:11.621
or I'll put a bullet in that
pretty little face of yours.

08:11.623 --> 08:13.688
You understand? You're gonna stay
focused and you're gonna drive.

08:13.690 --> 08:15.089
You understand? Nod.

08:15.091 --> 08:16.389
Gotta go, honey.

08:16.391 --> 08:18.154
Don't look at them.
Eyes on me.

08:18.156 --> 08:20.021
Eyes on me.
Hands on the wheel.

08:20.023 --> 08:21.522
- Bobby, we gotta go.
- I can't do it, man.

08:21.524 --> 08:24.155
- I can't do it! I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

08:24.157 --> 08:26.422
- How about fucking now?
- Okay, I'll do it! Okay!

08:35.554 --> 08:37.354
Oh, my God,
we're gonna die.

08:40.090 --> 08:41.421
Go, go, go,
go, go, go! Come on!

08:41.423 --> 08:43.489
- This is as fast as we can go.
- Drive!

08:52.089 --> 08:53.754
- Jewel, company.
- Please stop the car.

08:53.756 --> 08:55.254
Shut up!

08:55.623 --> 08:57.987
Don't try to be cute. Two hands
on the wheel, face forward.

08:59.921 --> 09:02.021
Just pull the car over, okay?

09:03.487 --> 09:06.186
God!

09:12.856 --> 09:14.188
Whoo!

09:19.122 --> 09:20.388
Put it into gear!

09:26.920 --> 09:28.618
Look out! Duck!

09:34.653 --> 09:37.019
You having fun yet,
college girl?

09:48.187 --> 09:50.152
You guys are fuckin' crazy,
you know that?

09:50.154 --> 09:51.318
Yes. Just go!

10:00.920 --> 10:02.518
Please stop the car.
I beg you.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.183
It's not too late.
No one has to die.

10:04.185 --> 10:06.451
Shut up, bitch!

10:22.853 --> 10:24.051
Oh, what a rush!

10:25.320 --> 10:27.418
Okay, get on the freeway
right here.

10:43.619 --> 10:44.782
Take that exit.

10:45.285 --> 10:46.783
Take the exit
right here!

10:47.418 --> 10:48.917
The one
right up here, go!

10:49.285 --> 10:50.848
You want a bullet
in the brain? Take it!

10:50.850 --> 10:52.083
Okay, okay!

11:02.451 --> 11:05.282
Yes! Yes, baby!
Great shot! Yes!

11:05.284 --> 11:07.383
Yes! Yes!

11:07.385 --> 11:10.115
Keep driving, good job.
Good job, babyface.

11:10.484 --> 11:11.649
Keep us going straight.

11:11.651 --> 11:15.284
Come and get it, fuckers!

12:33.312 --> 12:34.878
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:34.880 --> 12:36.578
Stop it!

12:36.881 --> 12:38.180
Let go!

12:39.648 --> 12:40.613
Look out!

13:14.345 --> 13:17.277
Get off me! Get off me!

13:20.046 --> 13:22.244
Speak English or I'm gonna
blow your brains out.

13:22.881 --> 13:23.813
Oh, no!

13:32.544 --> 13:34.109
We might. I don't know.

13:34.111 --> 13:36.644
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- Oh, yeah? What was the plan?

13:37.047 --> 13:39.544
We wouldn't be in this mess if
you kept your eyes on your gun.

13:39.546 --> 13:41.578
Hey! We're not doing this.

13:41.580 --> 13:42.746
Stop.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.810
Please don't kill them.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.577
No, no, no, no, no.

13:50.844 --> 13:53.109
That's not an option.

13:53.111 --> 13:54.609
You think you can pull a stunt like this,
we're just gonna let you walk away free?

13:54.611 --> 13:56.241
You're not very smart
for a college girl.

13:56.644 --> 13:58.542
We're not a threat to you.
Just take your money and go.

13:58.544 --> 13:59.776
We won't tell anyone.

13:59.979 --> 14:02.544
Do you see this?
All of this is your fault!

14:03.077 --> 14:05.476
What do you think was gonna
happen when you went for my gun?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.743
Not a scratch on her.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.544
Doesn't seem fair to me.

14:14.344 --> 14:15.843
Maybe I should give you one.

14:30.176 --> 14:31.475
Start walking.

14:48.745 --> 14:50.876
Hey, where are you
taking us?

15:02.340 --> 15:03.239
There.

15:04.276 --> 15:05.841
We'll hold up there
for the night and regroup.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.841
Yeah?

15:14.242 --> 15:16.275
Walk.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.605
Okay, Jewel.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.339
Wake up.

16:00.608 --> 16:01.907
You got people
looking for you?

16:02.740 --> 16:03.639
Huh?

16:04.908 --> 16:05.840
Yes.

16:09.574 --> 16:11.039
I only ask...

16:11.775 --> 16:14.073
because if you do have people
out there looking for you,

16:14.439 --> 16:15.970
Jewel over there...

16:19.640 --> 16:22.273
Well, she's
gonna have to kill them.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.505
So I'm gonna ask again.

16:26.373 --> 16:27.571
Is there anyone out there

16:28.005 --> 16:30.404
that would have noticed
you've gone missing by now?

16:31.807 --> 16:33.471
No, no.

16:33.473 --> 16:35.237
- No, no. No.
- No?

16:35.239 --> 16:36.837
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

16:38.973 --> 16:39.972
Good girl.

16:48.039 --> 16:50.572
Please untie me.
I need to help my friend.

16:51.437 --> 16:53.336
She needs a doctor.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.004
You're the one who decided
to go for my gun in the car.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.404
That's why he's shot,

17:00.671 --> 17:03.070
and that's why her leg
is all chewed up like that.

17:03.506 --> 17:04.771
All this,

17:05.204 --> 17:06.536
it's on you, sweetie.

17:06.538 --> 17:09.369
Please. I'll do anything.
I'm really sorry.

17:09.372 --> 17:10.869
Just let her go.

17:10.872 --> 17:13.036
You don't need all three of us.
Just... Just take me.

17:13.707 --> 17:16.104
I don't want her to die.
Please, please.

17:16.604 --> 17:18.703
I don't want her to die.

17:25.472 --> 17:27.103
Oh, yeah.

17:28.703 --> 17:31.069
Oh, God, look at you.

17:32.370 --> 17:33.704
Let me help.

17:49.404 --> 17:50.501
All better.

17:54.070 --> 17:56.702
You're a real bitch,
aren't you?

18:03.071 --> 18:05.969
You know, most women will
find that word offensive.

18:07.936 --> 18:08.935
Not me.

18:10.503 --> 18:11.702
'Cause you see,
when I was a little girl,

18:11.902 --> 18:14.800
my daddy came home
one night, piss drunk.

18:15.101 --> 18:16.267
Started laying into Mom.

18:16.803 --> 18:18.735
When she fell to the ground...

18:19.137 --> 18:22.001
...he called her a worthless bitch.

18:23.437 --> 18:24.703
Just kept hitting her.

18:26.202 --> 18:28.901
You know what she did?
She just laid there and took it.

18:31.436 --> 18:32.800
Not me.

18:33.069 --> 18:35.866
I went in the closet, and I
pulled out my daddy's shotgun,

18:35.868 --> 18:40.533
and I blew a hole right through my daddy's chest.

18:42.502 --> 18:46.100
So you see,
when I hear that word "bitch,"

18:46.701 --> 18:50.633
it is a reminder
of exactly how strong I am.

18:51.101 --> 18:52.733
It's empowering.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.833
Hell.

18:56.066 --> 18:57.498
It's arousing.

19:00.803 --> 19:02.101
Tell me something.

19:04.802 --> 19:07.034
Have you ever been
with a white woman?

19:16.767 --> 19:19.466
Weak. Just like my mom.

19:20.198 --> 19:21.697
Just like Mom.

19:50.165 --> 19:53.931
Hey, hey. We need to find
a way to get out, now.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.764
We need something sharp
to break us out.

20:00.234 --> 20:01.266
What do you see?

20:01.798 --> 20:03.064
Anything we can use?

20:03.931 --> 20:05.697
- Okay, I see a table.
- Uh-huh.

20:05.699 --> 20:07.699
Old wood, broken lamp.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.229
Okay. Chair.

20:11.565 --> 20:13.997
A large trunk here
and sheets.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.264
Nothing useful.

20:19.599 --> 20:20.730
I don't see anything else.

20:21.131 --> 20:24.196
What about the other corner
over there?

20:26.196 --> 20:29.164
Maybe a jar, nothing we could use.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.931
Jar? Jar?

20:30.933 --> 20:32.597
- Where?
- Over there.

20:37.298 --> 20:38.529
Your friend...

20:39.462 --> 20:40.827
can she knock it over?

20:42.431 --> 20:43.696
No. No, no, no, no.

20:43.698 --> 20:45.761
- We've gotta do this.
- She's injured.

20:45.763 --> 20:47.428
We gotta do this.

20:48.097 --> 20:50.961
You want to wait here
for that psycho to come back in?

20:52.197 --> 20:53.129
Try it.

20:53.131 --> 20:54.129
Okay.

20:54.898 --> 20:56.762
- Earn, Earn.
- Huh?

21:03.764 --> 21:05.161
Please, Earn.

21:07.231 --> 21:09.461
Oh, no, no. Earn.

21:09.463 --> 21:11.329
Earn, Earn.

21:17.896 --> 21:20.127
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:25.629 --> 21:27.226
Hey, hey, you can do it.

21:29.797 --> 21:30.996
Oh, my God.

21:40.663 --> 21:42.661
We're all gonna
get out of here, okay?

21:42.663 --> 21:44.361
- Okay, okay.
- Just try.

21:48.863 --> 21:50.292
- You can do it.
- You're so close.

21:58.330 --> 22:00.162
Okay.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.827
- Oh, my God. Yes.
- Okay?

22:07.828 --> 22:09.493
Good job, good job.

22:09.762 --> 22:10.960
Good job.

22:27.026 --> 22:28.259
It worked.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.392
Too loud, too loud.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.126
I'm Winny, by the way.

22:44.759 --> 22:46.058
I'm Chaow.

22:57.660 --> 22:58.860
Okay.

23:50.824 --> 23:53.756
Okay. I think
we can put her in this room.

24:00.691 --> 24:02.023
Earn, ready?

24:05.492 --> 24:06.389
Okay.

24:29.391 --> 24:30.489
We gotta go.

24:39.723 --> 24:41.188
It'll be okay.

25:34.454 --> 25:37.519
Okay. Let's keep going
before they realize we're gone.

25:37.819 --> 25:39.184
- Okay.
- Let's go.

27:02.752 --> 27:04.149
Winny.

27:59.149 --> 28:01.380
Hurry. Let's go.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.812
There.
There's a light up ahead.

28:06.814 --> 28:08.211
Let's check it out.

28:17.615 --> 28:19.113
Isn't that the same house?

28:22.048 --> 28:23.315
Chaow.

28:28.815 --> 28:30.047
This can't be happening.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.180
What the hell is that?

28:36.781 --> 28:38.044
Gotta go. Let's go.

28:38.046 --> 28:39.444
Let's go back to the house.

28:56.215 --> 28:58.147
Go! Run!

29:34.145 --> 29:35.543
Wait, wait, wait.

29:36.180 --> 29:37.312
Did you hear that?

29:37.644 --> 29:39.376
- I thought I heard...
- We have to go.

29:49.344 --> 29:50.677
That just happened.

29:51.645 --> 29:52.711
Right?

29:53.745 --> 29:56.443
- That thing there.
- We need to go get Earn.

29:57.445 --> 29:59.443
- We got to find Earn.
- What?

29:59.445 --> 30:01.643
We have to go look.
Earn's upstairs.

30:02.212 --> 30:03.710
- We need to find Earn.
- Wait, wait.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.976
Earn's upstairs.
Earn's upstairs.

30:06.378 --> 30:07.809
She's upstairs.

30:15.676 --> 30:16.675
Winny, wait.

30:37.409 --> 30:38.641
She's gone.

30:40.177 --> 30:41.410
They found her.

31:03.408 --> 31:04.640
Earn?

31:12.309 --> 31:14.472
This place creeps me out.

31:15.642 --> 31:16.574
Yeah.

31:42.541 --> 31:44.239
You ever
think about stopping?

31:45.906 --> 31:46.871
Stopping?

31:47.475 --> 31:49.505
You know, this.

31:52.541 --> 31:53.773
Take all that money.

31:55.007 --> 31:56.538
Find someplace nice.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.372
Yeah, that'll be the day.

32:14.406 --> 32:16.338
Come on, how long do you think
we can keep this up?

32:16.773 --> 32:17.838
What?

32:18.640 --> 32:20.371
You said the wedding
was gonna be our last gig.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.338
That was an eternity ago.

32:25.673 --> 32:27.305
You're not serious,
are you?

32:28.639 --> 32:30.138
We barely got away
this time.

32:30.140 --> 32:31.971
Oh, my God, stop.

32:35.305 --> 32:36.604
I'm cutting you off.

32:38.238 --> 32:41.004
This time tomorrow we'll be on
a plane on our way to Paris.

32:41.639 --> 32:43.236
This is who we are, babe.

32:56.937 --> 32:57.902
What is that?

33:04.772 --> 33:06.437
Maybe we better
keep moving.

33:35.504 --> 33:37.836
- They took her.
- Calm down.

33:39.169 --> 33:40.534
We'll find her.

34:25.768 --> 34:27.232
Earn?

34:29.002 --> 34:31.565
Earn? Hurry. Earn.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.868
- Fuck!
- Here, let me try, let me try.

35:06.469 --> 35:07.866
Let's try this.

35:09.966 --> 35:11.032
Earn, watch out.

35:15.233 --> 35:17.365
It's not working.

35:19.102 --> 35:20.667
- Earn.
- Shit.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.099
Are you there?

35:26.999 --> 35:29.064
We need to get their guns.

35:29.066 --> 35:29.965
Earn.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.032
I promise, okay?

36:31.530 --> 36:32.663
Shit.

36:52.697 --> 36:54.061
Bobby!

36:55.930 --> 36:56.862
Bobby!

37:00.298 --> 37:01.295
Bobby.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.395
What the hell are you doing?

37:45.397 --> 37:46.693
Come on, we have to go.

37:46.695 --> 37:47.761
Hey! What are you
talking about?

37:47.996 --> 37:49.927
They found us.
There's somebody out there.

38:05.095 --> 38:06.594
No one is out there.
You're just seeing things.

38:06.596 --> 38:08.927
- I know what I saw.
- Babe, look at me.

38:09.628 --> 38:11.159
Okay? We're fine.

38:11.161 --> 38:12.926
I am not going back
to jail, okay?

38:12.928 --> 38:14.460
- If it were the police...
- I can't.

38:14.462 --> 38:15.759
...they'd be swarming
the place.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.326
Get upstairs, check on the
hostages, and get the bags.

40:20.023 --> 40:21.454
Bobby, they're gone!

40:32.421 --> 40:33.720
Let him go!

40:35.789 --> 40:37.021
Get away from him.

40:37.587 --> 40:39.419
Get away from him!

40:40.422 --> 40:41.421
Put the gun down.

40:41.657 --> 40:43.354
What did you do
with my friend, huh?

40:43.823 --> 40:45.354
I know you guys
locked her up.

40:45.356 --> 40:46.521
Where's the key?

40:46.856 --> 40:48.787
Give me the key.

40:50.090 --> 40:51.454
Put the gun down.

40:53.491 --> 40:55.087
Why'd you lock my friend up?

40:55.854 --> 40:57.586
We didn't do anything to you.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.854
Why are you doing this to us?

41:00.055 --> 41:01.751
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:01.753 --> 41:04.551
Stop bullshitting me! I know
you have the key. Let her out.

41:05.356 --> 41:07.754
We didn't do anything
to deserve this.

41:08.290 --> 41:10.055
So what's your plan now, huh?

41:12.388 --> 41:15.186
You really think you and babyface
can make it out of here?

41:15.188 --> 41:16.186
Yeah.

41:17.555 --> 41:19.819
You really think
you stand a chance?

41:23.089 --> 41:25.020
Drop it or I'll shoot.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.252
We both know you're not
gonna pull that trigger.

41:35.654 --> 41:37.084
You're too pure.

41:38.821 --> 41:42.386
You're too fucking weak.

41:43.654 --> 41:46.251
You couldn't pull that trigger if
it was right in front of your...

41:49.520 --> 41:50.853
Run!

42:00.253 --> 42:01.218
Run!

42:08.985 --> 42:10.884
Go, go, go! Go!

42:17.453 --> 42:18.517
Damn it.

42:19.053 --> 42:20.785
Fuck! Fuck!

42:21.086 --> 42:22.184
Fuck!

42:22.186 --> 42:24.251
Fuck! You guys are dead!

42:24.253 --> 42:26.183
- You're dead!
- Bobby!

42:32.684 --> 42:33.950
I think he's out.

42:54.152 --> 42:56.350
Yes!

43:05.784 --> 43:09.283
Shit! No! No!

43:26.550 --> 43:28.214
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, I'm fine.

43:28.216 --> 43:30.648
- It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.
- Let me help you.

43:30.650 --> 43:31.882
Please let me help you.

43:33.049 --> 43:35.315
Wait, slowly.

43:36.615 --> 43:38.848
Okay. Give me your arm.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.083
I'm really sorry
about this.

43:48.085 --> 43:49.815
We were in the car.
I didn't mean to shoot.

43:49.817 --> 43:52.182
- I mean, they were trying to kill us.
- Hey, hey, hey.

43:53.383 --> 43:55.180
Don't worry about it, okay?

43:56.016 --> 43:57.981
I would have done
the same thing you did.

44:01.147 --> 44:03.480
Gotta keep pressure on
the wound to stop the bleeding.

44:08.414 --> 44:11.213
Don't take your hand off of it, okay?

44:11.950 --> 44:13.648
Let's get you off the floor.

44:15.949 --> 44:17.880
I'm gonna kill that bitch.

44:23.017 --> 44:24.249
Come on.

44:24.915 --> 44:26.014
Okay.

44:31.647 --> 44:33.178
- I'm gonna...
- Stay down.

44:33.749 --> 44:35.048
Stay down.

45:24.945 --> 45:26.010
Is something wrong?

45:26.345 --> 45:29.410
I'm gonna go
clear my head, okay?

45:37.080 --> 45:38.178
What are we
gonna do now, huh?

45:38.511 --> 45:40.745
You're shot,
I'm out of bullets,

45:40.747 --> 45:44.077
and those two little shits have our
money, passports, and plane tickets!

45:45.411 --> 45:46.410
Shit!

45:48.879 --> 45:50.478
- A bump.
- What?

45:50.979 --> 45:52.178
Gimme a bump.

45:52.611 --> 45:53.644
For the pain.

46:57.109 --> 46:58.408
Did you hear that?

47:59.840 --> 48:02.505
Let us out of here!

48:42.305 --> 48:44.169
- Who's on the other side?
- Let us out!

49:34.936 --> 49:37.434
I want you to
do something for me first.

52:25.264 --> 52:26.429
Chaow.

52:29.298 --> 52:30.464
Chaow?

52:34.098 --> 52:35.131
You okay?

52:37.630 --> 52:38.895
What's wrong?

52:40.731 --> 52:42.527
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

53:39.696 --> 53:41.127
Where'd you come from?

54:02.695 --> 54:03.960
Hello?

54:07.394 --> 54:08.627
What's your name?

57:39.520 --> 57:40.719
Jewel!

57:47.521 --> 57:48.819
Jewel!

57:49.353 --> 57:52.253
- What you doing? Winny, stop!
- That was Earn. She needs our help.

57:52.255 --> 57:55.286
Stop it!
It didn't sound like Earn.

57:56.354 --> 57:57.453
Not even close.

58:02.320 --> 58:03.353
Jewel!

58:06.120 --> 58:07.118
Jewel!

58:19.951 --> 58:22.050
When we were out
there trying to find help,

58:22.651 --> 58:25.415
I heard that exact same scream
from inside the house.

58:26.885 --> 58:28.383
And when we got back in,

58:29.086 --> 58:30.285
your friend was gone.

58:31.752 --> 58:33.751
Because those
two people took her.

58:34.018 --> 58:35.716
Those bastards locked her up
in the room.

58:35.718 --> 58:38.351
I mean, she's screaming for help.
She's begging for our help.

58:38.718 --> 58:40.050
We need to go help her.

58:40.052 --> 58:42.148
What if that wasn't Earn?

58:45.185 --> 58:46.251
Jewel!

58:46.685 --> 58:48.716
Jewel!

58:49.984 --> 58:51.483
- Bobby!
- Jewel!

58:51.751 --> 58:54.482
How long are you gonna ignore the
fact of what's happened here?

58:57.518 --> 58:58.849
Chaow.

58:59.685 --> 59:02.116
We were lost, okay?

59:02.519 --> 59:03.751
You'd just been shot.

59:05.084 --> 59:06.382
We were running around the woods,
we were running in circles.

59:06.384 --> 59:08.382
We have no idea
what we saw.

59:13.484 --> 59:14.946
Everything's fine, okay?

59:14.948 --> 59:17.114
We just need
to get the key, get Earn,

59:17.384 --> 59:19.816
get out of this house,
we're gonna be okay.

59:21.017 --> 59:23.016
I'm not trying
to be insensitive here.

59:23.817 --> 59:27.580
I know... I know, I know she's
your friend, okay? I know.

59:27.582 --> 59:30.081
The sooner we start accepting
what's going on here,

59:30.450 --> 59:32.082
the sooner we can
get out of here.

59:32.448 --> 59:36.447
- This place is...
- There's nothing happening here, Chaow.

59:38.016 --> 59:39.848
She's dead...

59:51.150 --> 59:52.947
You don't want
to listen to me.

59:53.749 --> 59:55.181
Then don't listen to me.

59:56.484 --> 59:58.915
I'm sure as hell
not waiting here to die.

59:58.917 --> 01:00:00.347
Chaow.

01:01:06.181 --> 01:01:07.646
We can get out of here.

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:10.445
Winny!
Let her go! Let her go!

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.212
Let her go!

01:01:17.479 --> 01:01:18.612
Let her go!

01:01:20.746 --> 01:01:22.177
Where is she?

01:01:24.779 --> 01:01:26.344
Where is she?

01:01:26.612 --> 01:01:27.645
Let her go!

01:01:32.046 --> 01:01:33.245
Gimme that!

01:01:40.779 --> 01:01:42.409
Let's go!

01:01:44.446 --> 01:01:46.111
Shit, shit.

01:01:51.279 --> 01:01:53.045
Let him go.

01:01:53.047 --> 01:01:54.510
Let him go!

01:01:58.178 --> 01:02:00.076
Chaow!

01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:03.143
Oh, my God. Chaow!

01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:12.707
Chaow, are you okay?

01:02:12.709 --> 01:02:13.976
Yeah.

01:02:16.345 --> 01:02:18.208
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:18.544 --> 01:02:19.676
Is he dead?

01:02:20.377 --> 01:02:21.676
I don't know.

01:02:22.879 --> 01:02:24.143
Just go.

01:02:25.311 --> 01:02:27.443
We don't need the key.
Let's just go.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:46.442
Let's go.

01:02:57.009 --> 01:02:58.342
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:02:58.576 --> 01:03:00.174
- Stop it. We need to help Earn.
- No, no, no! No!

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.475
Earn is inside.
Get off me!

01:03:08.108 --> 01:03:09.372
- She's inside.
- Stop!

01:03:09.374 --> 01:03:10.574
We need to help Earn.

01:03:10.943 --> 01:03:12.806
- You don't know what's behind that door.
- Let me go!

01:03:12.808 --> 01:03:13.940
Earn's not in there.

01:03:14.642 --> 01:03:17.107
She's not in there.
Come on, stop it! No!

01:03:19.108 --> 01:03:20.974
Gimme the key,
gimme the key!

01:03:25.509 --> 01:03:26.906
No! No!

01:03:26.908 --> 01:03:30.306
Open the door! Open the door!

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:32.673
No!
Tell me where she is!

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:35.140
Jewel! Jewel!

01:03:35.142 --> 01:03:36.839
Open the door
or I swear to God...

01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:39.473
Open the door!

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.539
Open the door!

01:05:04.937 --> 01:05:06.237
Earn.

01:06:18.703 --> 01:06:19.634
Hey.

01:06:31.802 --> 01:06:33.200
What do you remember?

01:06:36.301 --> 01:06:37.399
What do you mean?

01:06:38.401 --> 01:06:39.733
Before the car crash.

01:06:40.502 --> 01:06:42.067
You remember
anything before that?

01:06:42.869 --> 01:06:44.635
Yeah. They robbed the bank
and then they...

01:06:44.637 --> 01:06:47.202
No, no, I mean,
before they robbed the bank.

01:06:49.136 --> 01:06:51.301
Like, what you were doing,

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.932
where you were,
how'd you get to the bank.

01:06:53.934 --> 01:06:56.267
I was with Earn,
and then...

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:10.733
Yeah.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.232
I can't remember neither.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.733
All I remember was
being in this house.

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:26.534
I feel like I...
I know this place.

01:07:27.402 --> 01:07:28.866
I keep seeing it
in my head.

01:07:29.399 --> 01:07:30.897
Repeating and repeating.

01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:33.464
Like a nightmare.

01:07:37.132 --> 01:07:38.697
And when I wake up,

01:07:39.134 --> 01:07:41.232
it starts all over again.

01:09:56.162 --> 01:09:58.428
The wine is ready
to be served, babyface.

01:14:43.685 --> 01:14:44.816
Chaow.

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:50.984
Chaow?

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:00.382
What?

01:15:06.217 --> 01:15:08.716
I need you to do
something for me first.

01:15:13.585 --> 01:15:15.750
- You promised me!
- Hey, calm down.

01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:18.250
And then we could
be together, right?

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.416
Promise me.

01:15:22.883 --> 01:15:24.182
I promise.

01:15:24.717 --> 01:15:26.949
After everything
I've ever done for you.

01:15:26.951 --> 01:15:28.448
Chaow, calm down.

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:30.848
Everything I have ever done
was for you!

01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:33.182
- What are you talking about?
- Stay away from me!

01:15:33.482 --> 01:15:35.747
- Chaow.
- Stay away from me!

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:50.781
Chaow.

01:16:13.915 --> 01:16:15.247
Chaow!

01:16:31.846 --> 01:16:33.444
Oh, my God. No.

01:16:36.782 --> 01:16:38.314
Oh, my God. No.

01:16:38.915 --> 01:16:40.413
Chaow.

01:16:44.347 --> 01:16:45.545
Chaow.

01:16:46.382 --> 01:16:47.478
Stay with me.

01:16:48.012 --> 01:16:49.643
Please stay with me.
Don't...

01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:52.045
Chaow, oh, my God.

01:16:53.613 --> 01:16:54.845
Chaow.

01:16:56.413 --> 01:16:58.312
Hey. Hey.

01:16:58.746 --> 01:17:00.078
Stay with me.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.246
You promised me.

01:17:08.014 --> 01:17:10.512
Bad decisions...

01:17:11.847 --> 01:17:14.379
have a way of coming back...

01:17:16.747 --> 01:17:18.412
to haunt you.

01:17:48.779 --> 01:17:51.412
Now what's a lady like you
doing killing all these folks?

01:17:52.314 --> 01:17:53.911
Husband didn't seem that bad.

01:17:58.509 --> 01:18:00.041
I'm sure
you had your reasons.

01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:02.409
I don't really care
one way or the other,

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:04.342
but you did promise us
20% of the cut.

01:18:07.978 --> 01:18:09.343
What?

01:18:23.243 --> 01:18:25.309
Do you have people
out there looking for you?

01:18:29.544 --> 01:18:32.843
I only ask
because if you do,

01:18:33.245 --> 01:18:34.609
I'd have to kill them.

01:18:47.509 --> 01:18:49.507
You're gonna
burn in hell for this.

01:18:55.509 --> 01:18:58.142
Then I'll see
all of you there with me.

01:19:14.707 --> 01:19:15.906
You promised me...

01:19:17.576 --> 01:19:19.241
that we'd be together,
right?

01:19:35.175 --> 01:19:37.240
Why would a woman like me

01:19:37.809 --> 01:19:40.573
ever be with a man like you?

01:20:54.138 --> 01:20:55.837
<i>I keep having this dream,</i>

01:20:56.205 --> 01:20:57.870
<i>the kind
that seems so real</i>

01:20:57.872 --> 01:21:01.170
<i>and becomes so terrifying
you wake up screaming.</i>

01:21:07.839 --> 01:21:09.304
Where are we?

01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:15.369
<i>Only you realize
the dream isn't over.</i>

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:19.136
<i>What do you remember
before the car crash?</i>

01:21:20.537 --> 01:21:22.036
<i>Do you remember anything
before that?</i>

01:21:22.038 --> 01:21:23.502
<i>Why are you
doing this to us?</i>

01:21:23.804 --> 01:21:26.236
<i>We didn't do anything
to deserve this!</i>

01:21:26.238 --> 01:21:27.636
<i>Do you
remember what we did?</i>

01:21:29.272 --> 01:21:30.635
<i>I remember what we did.</i>

01:21:31.139 --> 01:21:34.304
<i>Everything that
I've ever done was for you!</i>

01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:36.368
<i>I remember everything.</i>

01:21:36.771 --> 01:21:38.002
Hey!

01:21:41.838 --> 01:21:44.870
<i>Do you see this?
All of this is your fault!</i>

01:21:45.603 --> 01:21:49.602
<i>And you're lying there,
trapped between two realms...</i>

01:21:50.203 --> 01:21:52.234
<i>Wake up.</i>

01:21:52.435 --> 01:21:55.599
<i>...unsure of what's
real and what's not.</i>

01:21:55.601 --> 01:21:57.166
<i>I keep seeing it in my head.</i>

01:21:57.537 --> 01:22:00.602
<i>Repeating and repeating,
like a nightmare.</i>

01:22:01.036 --> 01:22:02.901
<i>If you can't wake
up from the nightmare...</i>

01:22:02.903 --> 01:22:05.001
<i>You guys are dead!
You're dead!</i>

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:08.068
<i>...then maybe
you're not even asleep.</i>

01:22:24.801 --> 01:22:26.665
<i>You're gonna burn
in hell for what you did.</i>

01:22:32.201 --> 01:22:34.766
Please help me!
Open this door!

01:22:35.469 --> 01:22:36.935
Please, I beg you!

01:22:37.468 --> 01:22:39.801
I take it all back!
I'm sorry!

01:22:40.202 --> 01:22:42.534
I take it back, I'm sorry!

01:22:42.834 --> 01:22:46.366
Please tell me
how I can open this door!

01:22:46.934 --> 01:22:48.033
Please!

01:22:48.233 --> 01:22:49.566
Tell me what to do!

01:22:49.568 --> 01:22:52.732
Just tell me what to do!
I'll do anything!

01:22:53.233 --> 01:22:54.865
I'll do anything!

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:58.231
Just tell me what to do!

01:23:01.168 --> 01:23:02.666
I can't get in.

01:23:03.268 --> 01:23:04.998
I can't get in!

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.699
Please!

01:23:07.234 --> 01:23:09.299
Please!

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:26.331
Please, I beg you.

01:23:26.933 --> 01:23:28.231
Let me live.

01:23:29.268 --> 01:23:30.666
Please don't kill me.

01:23:30.668 --> 01:23:34.066
Please.
Please let me live, I beg you.

01:23:34.266 --> 01:23:37.198
- I'll do anything.
- I'll do anything.

01:23:37.865 --> 01:23:40.297
Please. Please.
