00:08.500 --> 00:10.800
My name is 
Melinda Gordon.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.100
I'm married,

00:12.200 --> 00:14.300
I live in a small town,

00:14.400 --> 00:16.200
and I own an antique shop.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.400
I might be just like you.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.200
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:20.300 --> 00:22.500
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.900
It's all right, honey.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.200
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:27.306 --> 00:29.700
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:29.804 --> 00:33.500
and they come to me for help.

00:35.004 --> 00:40.407
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:44.107 --> 00:47.406
Ok, this is ridiculous.
Tim stiffed you again?

00:47.509 --> 00:51.101
Yeah. And it had to be the night
I find a possible homicide.

00:51.206 --> 00:55.200
And guess who gets to drive
all the way down to central?

00:55.308 --> 00:59.602
Oh, that really is a long drive.
Listen, don't try to be a hero, ok?

00:59.708 --> 01:02.303
Get yourself a bed down there.
Bet you're sleepy.

01:02.407 --> 01:07.703
Well, why don't you give me a little
something to stay up for? Like...

01:07.806 --> 01:11.103
what are you wearing?

01:11.306 --> 01:12.402
Nothing.

01:12.505 --> 01:16.403
No! No, no, no. Tonight it's
pink flannel pyjama, isn't it?

01:16.508 --> 01:17.703
Ok, yes, it is.

01:17.808 --> 01:20.102
But you know what? You either get
sexy wife or sensible wife,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.502
and you're not home, so it's sensible.

01:22.606 --> 01:24.503
Fair enough.

01:24.607 --> 01:26.601
Climb into bed.
I'll be home soon.

01:26.708 --> 01:28.300
Ok. Love you.

01:28.405 --> 01:31.201
Love you, too.

01:35.205 --> 01:36.600
Evening, sir.

01:36.708 --> 01:40.001
Clancy. Long time no see.

01:40.108 --> 01:42.603
- What's happening, Harold?
- The usual party.

01:42.708 --> 01:45.700
Just don't ask what we use for piÃ‘atas.

01:45.806 --> 01:50.400
- Need a hand?
- Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.

01:51.906 --> 01:55.403
All right, on 3.
And... 3.

01:59.506 --> 02:01.603
You couldn't take time
to aspirate the guy for me?

02:01.708 --> 02:03.302
Sorry. I'm flying solo.

02:03.407 --> 02:06.601
Flaherty was supposed to come with
but he bagged out on me.

02:06.708 --> 02:10.803
- How about you? Busy night?
- Not really.

02:10.907 --> 02:14.700
Although mr. Krushenzo should
lighten things up for us.

02:14.807 --> 02:19.500
- Autoerotic asphyxiation, huh?
- God bless the weird ones.

02:19.606 --> 02:24.202
- What's this guy's deal?
- John Doe. No I.D.

02:24.307 --> 02:30.602
Nothing in the files. He's gonna
have to stay on ice until
somebody comes forward.

02:30.706 --> 02:33.302
He's missing his middle toe.

02:33.408 --> 02:35.803
That looks new.
Did you check records on him?

02:35.906 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, I did. He hadn't had
any foot surgery recently, so...

02:40.105 --> 02:42.901
I'm back at square zero.

02:43.008 --> 02:48.202
- Say hi to Melinda for me, will you?
- All right. Will do.

02:48.308 --> 02:50.801
Thanks, Harold.

02:50.906 --> 02:54.903
All right, you take it easy here.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.802
Episode 2x16
"The Walk-In"

04:23.805 --> 04:26.501
Who are you?

04:32.005 --> 04:35.002
Can you show me?

04:36.707 --> 04:39.201
Ok, maybe you're confused.

04:39.306 --> 04:43.803
And you don't understand yet
that you're dead.

04:43.905 --> 04:45.301
No.

04:45.405 --> 04:50.902
Do you remember anything about
what happened when you died?

04:51.108 --> 04:54.302
I don't think I did.

04:54.706 --> 04:55.902
Hi Mel.

04:56.005 --> 04:59.401
It's not a look I was hopen to see.

04:59.506 --> 05:01.303
Yeah, we had a...

05:01.408 --> 05:03.003
a visitor, but he's gone now.

05:03.106 --> 05:05.202
Well, I hope I didn't
bring him home with me.

05:05.308 --> 05:08.103
Didn't you tell me once
that ghosts hate morgues?

05:08.206 --> 05:11.601
Yeah, they do.
There's no energy for them.

05:11.707 --> 05:15.100
It seemed like a new spirit, though.
Maybe he was confused?

05:15.208 --> 05:18.301
Well, let's hope so.

05:18.407 --> 05:20.600
???

05:21.205 --> 05:24.102
Oh, no, thanks.

05:24.306 --> 05:26.502
Ok.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.702
Ok.

05:42.905 --> 05:48.100
- You have a good night's sleep.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

05:50.805 --> 05:52.002
Are you...

05:52.105 --> 05:56.702
not wearing what I think
you're not wearing?

06:01.008 --> 06:02.901
Hey, buddy.

06:03.007 --> 06:04.700
No.

06:04.805 --> 06:07.800
No no.
You don't get to "hey, buddy" me.

06:07.906 --> 06:09.503
What the hell happened to you?

06:09.605 --> 06:13.700
Do you know how much grief I've gotten
from my wife because of you?

06:13.805 --> 06:16.101
You stood up Delia, Melinda's
friend and my friend, and...

06:16.206 --> 06:18.000
Look, I'm sorry.

06:18.105 --> 06:21.503
I... I didn't know
how to face you or her.

06:21.606 --> 06:24.400
What happened?

06:25.607 --> 06:28.003
Look, it was the pressure. All right?

06:28.105 --> 06:30.701
We... we were just running
into each other round town.

06:30.805 --> 06:33.000
???

06:33.908 --> 06:35.403
Ok.

06:35.508 --> 06:37.703
So then you just don't show up.

06:37.808 --> 06:39.201
What are you trying to do,
get her to hate you?

06:39.306 --> 06:45.502
Sometimes it's more fun to think
about things than actually have them.

06:47.905 --> 06:51.201
All right, Flaherty.
You're my friend. I won't judge.

06:51.308 --> 06:52.703
Much.

06:52.807 --> 06:56.301
Wait. I got totally turned around.
That's why I'm back.

06:56.405 --> 06:56.802
What?

06:56.905 --> 06:59.501
I'm gonna make it right with you,
I'm gonna make it right with Delia.

06:59.605 --> 07:02.703
At least you realize you're a moron.
That's a good first step.

07:02.807 --> 07:05.400
But Delia?

07:05.806 --> 07:08.901
Good luck with that one.

07:09.005 --> 07:11.600
You watch.

07:17.906 --> 07:19.800
Flaher...
Did you see my ring?

07:19.906 --> 07:22.102
No.

07:38.408 --> 07:40.401
All of this because you lost
your paramedic ring?

07:40.508 --> 07:44.002
- No, really, it was stolen.
- How do you know?

07:44.107 --> 07:46.800
I saw these.

07:48.106 --> 07:49.403
And that's not all.

07:49.507 --> 07:53.001
You see how the middle toe's
missing on the right foot?

07:53.107 --> 07:56.001
I've seen that before.

07:56.106 --> 08:00.500
Tell me this is just a prank or a dream.
I'll accept either one.

08:00.608 --> 08:02.803
Harold, how do you lose a body?

08:02.908 --> 08:04.902
My boss wants to know the same thing.

08:05.007 --> 08:07.902
It's gonna be my ass if I can't
come up with an explanation.

08:08.006 --> 08:11.200
All I can tell you is,
last night the power went out.

08:11.306 --> 08:14.801
I went to check the circuit breaker.
I hear this bang.

08:14.906 --> 08:18.802
Come back in here...
he's gone.

08:19.108 --> 08:21.802
All I got are the digitals
that I took of the body.

08:21.906 --> 08:24.800
Can I see them?

08:26.408 --> 08:28.800
- Look, Harold, could somebody
have stolen the body? - No! No.

08:28.906 --> 08:32.400
We're locked up solid. You know that.
We haven't had a break-in since
the early nineties.

08:32.506 --> 08:37.201
- What about the guy I brought in?
- He's fine. Still here. He hasn't moved.

08:37.306 --> 08:40.302
- How did this guy die?
- It was an anonymous hit-and-run.

08:40.405 --> 08:42.903
You're sure he's dead, right?

08:43.006 --> 08:44.101
She's got a point.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.902
- He could have got up and walked out.
The guy I brought... - Excuse me.

08:47.008 --> 08:50.500
I've been doing this a while.
I know dead.

08:50.605 --> 08:53.702
Look. Take a look at this.

08:53.807 --> 08:57.602
This is a morbidity thermometer.
We use it to measure body temperature.

08:57.707 --> 08:59.901
Helps us determine when somebody died.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.502
I haven't cleared it since
I took John Doe's temp last night.

09:02.605 --> 09:03.901
90 degrees.

09:04.007 --> 09:06.402
See, a body cools one degree per hour.

09:06.506 --> 09:11.002
This is not a prank.
This is rigor mortis.

09:13.608 --> 09:17.502
I gotta go let somebody in downstairs.
Don't touch anything.

09:17.606 --> 09:20.501
Thanks, Harold.

09:21.808 --> 09:23.803
All right, are you sure that
the ghost from last night

09:23.908 --> 09:25.600
- is the guy in the photograph?
- Yeah, positive.

09:25.707 --> 09:28.703
- I got a really good look im last
night. - How can this be happening?

09:28.806 --> 09:30.102
Somebody came back from the dead.

09:30.207 --> 09:33.500
- No, and if he has, why would he
also appear as... - I'm sorry.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.101
I'm sorry. It's not me.

09:36.206 --> 09:37.501
What?

09:37.607 --> 09:39.602
He's here.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.602
The--the--in the photo?

09:42.807 --> 09:45.100
They can't hear me.
Why can't they hear me?

09:45.204 --> 09:47.200
- Who?
- Them!

09:47.304 --> 09:49.807
- Ok, tell me what's happening.
- Tell me what's happening.

09:49.907 --> 09:51.706
My body is moving.

09:51.809 --> 09:56.103
- You mean your body's being moved.
- No! I'm running. My feet are bleeding.

09:56.208 --> 10:00.403
I cut them trying to escape.
I... but I didn't want to escape.

10:00.505 --> 10:03.801
What's wrong with me?

10:14.105 --> 10:17.703
People are starring at me.

10:19.605 --> 10:23.102
I've stolen something.
There's--there's people.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.901
Soldiers.

10:25.005 --> 10:26.601
Soldiers?

10:26.706 --> 10:29.701
Statues.

10:29.707 --> 10:32.003
He's moving.
He's in village square.

10:32.107 --> 10:36.001
How can they see me if I'm dead?

10:47.407 --> 10:51.001
This footage is from the security
cameras at the dry cleaners. Jim got it.

10:51.105 --> 10:52.802
Big brother comes to Grandview.

10:52.907 --> 10:55.601
Can we just watch
and try not to speak?

10:55.706 --> 10:57.403
You're not gonna ask me
to solve a crime, are you?

10:57.508 --> 10:59.903
I mean, I appreciate the fact that you
think I'm all things to all people.

11:00.006 --> 11:02.901
- The shoplifter is dead. - Dead,
that seems like a harsh punishment.

11:03.008 --> 11:04.201
They don't fool around
at this dry cleaners.

11:04.307 --> 11:07.901
He is dead while he's shoplifting.
We are watching him dead.

11:08.008 --> 11:11.000
- Dead man walking.
- Dead man shopping.

11:11.106 --> 11:14.403
We think that he took Jim's ring.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.400
- What do you know about voodoo?
- I don't know.

11:16.508 --> 11:19.502
- What I've seen in horror movies?
- That's unfortunate, but it's typical.

11:19.605 --> 11:20.901
It's all right.

11:21.006 --> 11:23.503
The voodoo culture is very,
very rich in history.

11:23.606 --> 11:25.902
They believe in something
called tri-bon-age.

11:26.007 --> 11:27.801
Which roughly translates to
"earth soul".

11:27.906 --> 11:31.802
The haitians believe that when you die,
your earth soul is released to the cosmos,

11:31.907 --> 11:35.102
but sometimes your earth soul gets
stuck. Maybe it even comes back

11:35.206 --> 11:37.303
and gets put into a corpse.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.100
- Ever heard of zombies?
- Yeah.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.701
Yeah, probably what you've
seen in the movies.

11:40.805 --> 11:43.300
Well, the myth starts, somebody,
usually a voodoo priest

11:43.408 --> 11:45.902
can take that earth soul, put it
into a corpse, and control it,

11:46.007 --> 11:49.002
make it do whatever it wants.
Walk, talk, whatever.

11:49.106 --> 11:52.102
But sometimes the earth soul...
not very happy about it.

11:52.206 --> 11:53.203
And that's why it's coming to me.

11:53.308 --> 11:54.702
Did you see how clumsy
it was in that video?

11:54.808 --> 11:56.301
Yeah, like he couldn't
stand on its feet.

11:56.405 --> 11:58.603
Yeah, it's like the soul is trying
restore control over the body.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.403
They're literally at war
with each other, Melinda

12:00.505 --> 12:02.403
Ok, so if the ghost in the body
is coming to me,

12:02.505 --> 12:04.200
then who's actually in the body?

12:04.307 --> 12:07.100
We've been talking for, like 3 minutes.
You might want to give me 8-9 minutes

12:07.207 --> 12:09.000
before I unravel the entire mystery, ok?

12:09.108 --> 12:10.401
- Ok, sorry.
- It's ok.

12:10.505 --> 12:13.402
- You know what I say about
instant gratification? - What?

12:13.508 --> 12:16.403
Takes too long.

12:16.708 --> 12:17.503
So here's what we got.

12:17.607 --> 12:20.803
We have an occupying force in the body
that we must have leave the body.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.203
Which means you are going to need this.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.102
Didn't I get this at the 99 cent store?

12:26.206 --> 12:28.403
Maybe. I got mine at bed,
bath, and voodoo.

12:28.505 --> 12:33.100
But this one was blessed
by a haitian voodoo shaman.

12:33.208 --> 12:35.400
Oh, what that is is actually a spirit jar.

12:35.508 --> 12:41.400
You light a fire inside and it guides
the earth soul to it, helps it cross over.

12:41.508 --> 12:44.802
Or it's for keeping mosquitoes away.
It might be a candle or something.

12:44.907 --> 12:48.302
It's useful either way.

13:55.806 --> 13:58.302
I like this.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.700
It makes me feel calm.

14:00.806 --> 14:03.900
My name is Melinda.

14:04.007 --> 14:09.400
Can you tell me something about
yourself, like your name?

14:09.506 --> 14:11.902
Bryan.

14:12.707 --> 14:16.103
- Bryan Curtis.
- Bryan, great.

14:16.207 --> 14:18.803
That's a great start.

14:18.908 --> 14:24.003
This candle's supposed to help you
cross over into the light.

14:24.105 --> 14:26.602
Do you see a light?

14:26.707 --> 14:29.202
Not yet.

14:30.507 --> 14:33.403
Not while these things
are happening to my body.

14:33.505 --> 14:37.003
Who's controlling you?
Can you see him?

14:37.107 --> 14:38.900
No.

14:39.008 --> 14:42.302
But it's... it's hard.

14:43.107 --> 14:46.503
I loose track of who I am,
when he is doing this.

14:46.606 --> 14:48.203
Where I am.

14:48.306 --> 14:51.803
You were able to give me a detail
last time to help me figure out

14:51.908 --> 14:54.803
where you were.
Can you do that again?

14:54.907 --> 14:57.902
There's a light.

14:58.005 --> 15:01.302
A blue or white light.

15:01.805 --> 15:05.001
Wait, I... I can see it.
It's... it's neon.

15:05.107 --> 15:08.100
- There's a neon sign.
- What does it say?

15:08.205 --> 15:11.502
Uh... there's... it's an "x"!

15:11.605 --> 15:15.202
Or letter... a "p", "r"...

15:23.407 --> 15:28.000
I don't know if this is the right place,
but it's the closest I can figure out.

15:28.105 --> 15:32.500
I think, someone got here
before we did.

15:32.705 --> 15:35.500
Mel, I'm sure the cops are coming.
You think this is a good idea?

15:35.608 --> 15:38.102
Well, it's the only way we can
free Bryan from whoever

15:38.207 --> 15:44.003
or whatever's controlling him.
I can't do that if he's in jail.

15:49.605 --> 15:51.503
It's the body from the morgue.

15:51.607 --> 15:54.003
That's him.

15:54.107 --> 15:56.001
Why is he making that noise?

15:56.105 --> 16:01.400
I think he's trying to set his own ribs.
Remember, he got hit by that car?

16:01.505 --> 16:04.101
Uhh... Bryan?

16:04.206 --> 16:06.102
It's me. Melinda.

16:06.207 --> 16:10.103
Do you remember?
You came to me.

16:12.408 --> 16:15.403
Do all your ghosts look like this?

16:15.505 --> 16:17.901
No.
He's a zombie.

16:18.005 --> 16:24.502
- Are you ready to cross over yet?
- I can't. Not till he's out of my body.

16:25.607 --> 16:29.103
No... I need to find her.

16:30.905 --> 16:33.300
Um... who are you?

16:33.408 --> 16:34.303
What's going on?

16:34.405 --> 16:37.600
There's another ghost inside
Bryan's body. He's just a kid.

16:37.707 --> 16:40.803
I have to find her.

16:41.405 --> 16:45.001
I need to finish the list.

17:06.807 --> 17:08.701
That's not normal.

17:08.805 --> 17:10.101
Yeah.

17:10.306 --> 17:12.601
Now I have to cross over 2 ghosts.

17:12.704 --> 17:16.502
The idea of a ghost in a dead body
is not as out there as it sounds.

17:16.608 --> 17:18.701
See, the thing that bothers me
is that usually when a ghost

17:18.807 --> 17:20.500
takes over a living body,
it's in short spurts.

17:20.605 --> 17:23.502
But this ghost is just running
full-bore over this person.

17:23.605 --> 17:26.300
Which takes everything you and I know
about the supernatural and pretty much

17:26.406 --> 17:28.701
just blows it out of the water.

17:28.807 --> 17:32.303
Hey, let's say Kurt Cobain
takes over Elvis' body.

17:32.408 --> 17:34.803
Does Elvis know new licks
on the guitar now?

17:34.906 --> 17:37.203
Is he grundge?
I mean... what happens?

17:37.307 --> 17:39.501
How much of your old body
do you bring into your new body?

17:39.605 --> 17:41.402
And... and do the hips still work?

17:41.507 --> 17:44.500
When I saw Bryan and the ghost
inside him, he looked like teenager.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.002
Except there was something wrong
with one of his eyes. It drooped.

17:47.106 --> 17:50.201
Drooped how? Like a muscular
spasm or a purposeful effect?

17:50.306 --> 17:51.702
Spasm.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.803
Spasm...

17:53.905 --> 17:57.701
Do you remember how clumsy that
ghost was that we saw on the video?

17:57.806 --> 18:00.801
- How he was having such a hard
time with his body? - Right.

18:00.908 --> 18:02.903
Yeah. And then I gave you
some weirdo line. I said,

18:03.007 --> 18:06.200
"the body and soul are literally
at war with each other."

18:06.305 --> 18:07.301
Blah, blah, blah.

18:07.407 --> 18:09.600
And you believed me,
'cause you always do.

18:09.708 --> 18:14.403
But I think your truth might be
a little more grounded.

18:14.506 --> 18:16.700
Is this what you saw, Melinda?

18:16.805 --> 18:17.902
Yeah, that's it.

18:18.007 --> 18:21.002
Yeah, well, this is very common
in degenerative diseases

18:21.107 --> 18:25.000
that affect motor skills.
Multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy.

18:25.107 --> 18:28.100
Maybe the ghost that took over
this body had a similar handicap.

18:28.206 --> 18:30.903
- Uh, defect, whatever.
- He's not clumsy anymore.

18:31.008 --> 18:33.502
Right! He's not clumsy,
'cause he's in his new body.

18:33.607 --> 18:34.600
He's getting the lay of the land.

18:34.707 --> 18:38.202
He's saying, hey, this isn't the old
dead me. This is the new dead me.

18:38.305 --> 18:40.603
Not to mention,
living out his wildest dreams.

18:40.707 --> 18:41.301
What do you mean?

18:41.408 --> 18:44.003
If you couldn't walk, and you saw kids
running and jumping and doing

18:44.107 --> 18:47.403
all the things you dreamed of doing,
when you could, wouldn't you

18:47.508 --> 18:50.601
trade up for a new body? Wouldn't you
even come back from dead for a new body?

18:50.708 --> 18:53.302
Ok, so you're telling me that
this kid waited for somebody to die

18:53.408 --> 18:56.000
so he could come back and live
again without a handicap?

18:56.108 --> 18:58.703
Do you think it's easy being
this brilliant, Melinda?

18:58.808 --> 18:59.803
It's not.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.401
Sometimes it makes...

19:02.507 --> 19:04.203
it makes my head hurt, right here.

19:04.308 --> 19:06.003
Ok, well, there may be more to it than that.

19:06.105 --> 19:09.601
He said they had to find her
and finish some kind of list.

19:09.705 --> 19:10.702
What do you mean, "her"?

19:10.808 --> 19:12.502
He didn't say.

19:12.608 --> 19:14.303
- You might have a problem.
- Why?

19:14.408 --> 19:16.501
You said that ghost was 16 years old?

19:16.605 --> 19:18.701
No you're dealing with something
that's more unpredictable

19:18.805 --> 19:22.201
than a haitian death culture.
You're dealing with a teenage ghost

19:22.306 --> 19:26.500
inside a man's body with raging
hormones looking for a girl.

19:26.607 --> 19:29.200
Good luck.

20:08.305 --> 20:09.500
Hello?

20:09.607 --> 20:12.702
Hi, can I speak with Alyssa Adams, please?

20:12.805 --> 20:16.503
- This is Alyssa.
- Oh, great! Hi! This is Melinda Gordon.

20:16.605 --> 20:20.003
I'm actually looking for some
information on Jason Bennett.

20:20.106 --> 20:23.701
I read your, uh, memorial page
in the yearbook.

20:23.808 --> 20:25.802
Is this for the reunion reel?

20:25.906 --> 20:27.201
Sorry?

20:27.306 --> 20:29.101
For the 10-year reunion.

20:29.208 --> 20:34.001
I was already contacted about this,
and I think his parents are
contributing something.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.903
Yes! Yes, this is for the reunion.

20:38.008 --> 20:40.400
The one this weekend, yeah.

20:40.508 --> 20:42.601
You know, could we meet?

20:42.707 --> 20:47.902
Because I'd really like to
talk to you more about him.

20:56.205 --> 20:57.301
Hello?

20:57.406 --> 21:01.301
Sorry. Did I set the ringer too loud?

21:01.406 --> 21:04.102
Are you watching me?

21:04.207 --> 21:08.203
Only in the fun way.
Not in that crazy stalker way.

21:08.307 --> 21:11.300
What do you want?

21:11.607 --> 21:12.903
Say I'm sorry.

21:13.007 --> 21:16.102
You already did that.

21:16.207 --> 21:18.302
This is phase two.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.702
Look, you don't get to cue
your way out of this.

21:20.805 --> 21:23.500
You left me standing on the street
waiting for you.

21:23.608 --> 21:25.503
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that was?

21:25.608 --> 21:27.901
And then I had to walk
home after that?

21:28.005 --> 21:32.603
- I got no phone call, no explanation...
- But I have an explanation now.

21:32.707 --> 21:35.101
It's too late.

21:35.206 --> 21:40.702
And... since it took you this long,
you're even lamer than I thought.

21:40.807 --> 21:42.301
True.

21:42.407 --> 21:46.303
Completely, totally true. But...

21:46.605 --> 21:50.402
if I could just buy you a cup of
coffee, you know, or any dark liquid.

21:50.508 --> 21:52.400
Just have a minute.

21:52.507 --> 21:54.401
Tim, I gave you a minute.

21:54.507 --> 21:58.702
In fact, I gave you 30 long minutes.

21:59.005 --> 22:02.000
And you blew it.

22:05.605 --> 22:08.703
Well, we found one of his old yearbooks,

22:08.805 --> 22:11.101
and there was a reference
to a special girl.

22:11.205 --> 22:15.002
I was just wondering if you...

22:15.507 --> 22:20.003
We loved each other,
but... just friends.

22:25.607 --> 22:28.700
- He was so active.
- Yeah.

22:28.808 --> 22:33.101
He had muscular dystrophy, but he didn't
like to let one day go by

22:33.206 --> 22:35.300
without feeling like
he accomplished something.

22:35.405 --> 22:37.703
Like on the day we met,
it was in detention.

22:37.807 --> 22:38.900
Hmm, detention.

22:39.005 --> 22:43.001
He was in detention all the time.

22:43.207 --> 22:45.600
Do you know those old
showers in the chem lab

22:45.706 --> 22:49.601
with that emergency handle just in
case some kid sets himself on fire?

22:49.708 --> 22:55.701
He rolled himself under one of those
and shouted, "name the movie."

22:55.808 --> 23:00.901
Jason dripping wet in detention and
just furious that no one figured it out.

23:01.006 --> 23:04.300
- Flashdance?
- Yeah.

23:04.808 --> 23:07.902
I was the first to give him
the right answer.

23:08.008 --> 23:10.302
And he said, I had no choice.

23:10.405 --> 23:12.703
We would have to be
best friends from then on.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.700
It's been 10 years,
and I still miss him.

23:15.808 --> 23:19.503
We pulled so many schemes together.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.400
Just to feel like he could live.

23:22.506 --> 23:25.600
Is that why you took out
the page in the yearbook?

23:25.706 --> 23:28.002
"Not one day wasted"?

23:28.107 --> 23:30.400
Yeah.

23:31.008 --> 23:34.001
What's this list?

23:34.407 --> 23:39.402
At the end, Jason spent
a lot of time in the hospital.

23:39.505 --> 23:44.202
And it should have been
the worst time, but it wasn't.

23:44.305 --> 23:47.803
We dreamed up a list of things
to do before we died.

23:47.906 --> 23:52.303
- "Bungee jump off Grand Canyon"?
- Him.

23:52.506 --> 23:57.303
- "Open a studio in Paris."
- Yeah, so I could work on my collages.

23:57.407 --> 24:00.203
He knew that he would
never leave that room,

24:00.307 --> 24:05.203
and it couldn't stop him from
dreaming. It meant so much to him.

24:05.305 --> 24:08.100
Well, you kept the list. It must
have meant something to you too.

24:08.205 --> 24:09.800
No.

24:09.905 --> 24:10.801
The further the you get
from high school,

24:10.905 --> 24:15.002
the harder it is to make
your dreams come true.

24:15.107 --> 24:18.002
I still enjoy my art,
but I am not going to be selling it

24:18.108 --> 24:21.902
next to the Eiffel Tower anytime soon.

24:22.007 --> 24:25.900
Jason's the one that could
have done it. Not me.

24:26.005 --> 24:29.101
What about this last thing?
"Find Stephanie Hardwick"?

24:29.206 --> 24:31.003
Homecoming queen.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.300
The girl everybody loved.

24:33.405 --> 24:37.503
He wanted to find her
at the reunion and kiss her.

24:37.608 --> 24:38.603
Really?

24:38.707 --> 24:41.001
What guy wouldn't wanna
kiss the homecoming queen?

24:41.108 --> 24:45.703
But... why at the reunion?
I mean what was special about it?

24:45.805 --> 24:48.600
By 2007, Jason...

24:48.708 --> 24:51.600
he was sure they'd have
a cure for his M.D.

24:51.705 --> 24:54.402
And he'd be able to walk
into the reunion, and...

24:54.508 --> 24:58.301
Be the man he dreamed of being.

24:58.408 --> 25:00.102
I mean, who doesn't want to go
to their high school reunion

25:00.205 --> 25:01.900
- not looking like a rock star?
- Yeah, I know.

25:02.006 --> 25:06.000
Jason waited for a body he knew
would fit in at the reunion.

25:06.108 --> 25:09.700
Someone his own age, someone handsome.
Even the clothes he took.

25:09.808 --> 25:12.701
Yeah, just to impress miss Stephanie.

25:12.807 --> 25:15.102
Before he plants one on her.

25:15.206 --> 25:17.603
Oh, god. If he gets to her
before I can stop him...

25:17.708 --> 25:19.803
You should slip her
an altoid at least.

25:19.905 --> 25:24.100
Ok, you know what?
That is not funny.

25:25.706 --> 25:28.401
Here she is.

25:31.507 --> 25:35.602
You know, what if the body that
Jason took wasn't an accident?

25:35.707 --> 25:37.301
What do you mean?

25:37.407 --> 25:39.702
Stephanie Hardwick.
Homecoming queen.

25:39.807 --> 25:40.603
Yeah?

25:40.705 --> 25:44.401
Look at the homecoming king.

25:46.706 --> 25:48.700
Bryan and Jason were classmates.

25:48.806 --> 25:51.002
Jason didn't pick a random body.

25:51.107 --> 25:53.100
He picked the body.

25:53.207 --> 25:56.002
Of her date 10 years ago.

25:56.107 --> 25:59.303
"Varsity quarterback, valedictorian."

25:59.406 --> 26:02.403
Well, looks like the most popular guy
at school is gonna be going to his

26:02.505 --> 26:04.000
high school reunion after all.

26:04.105 --> 26:09.402
Yeah. He'll just be a lot
different than they remember.

26:37.805 --> 26:41.301
Usually a corpse is gonna
take 6 to 8 days to decay.

26:41.408 --> 26:42.902
We're only on day 3.

26:43.006 --> 26:45.903
That's assuming a perfect stress-free
environment here. Which we don't have.

26:46.006 --> 26:48.403
I mean, this guy is really putting
his body through the ringer.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.301
So how long will it be
before he breaks down?

26:50.406 --> 26:52.900
- I would say 6, maybe 8 hours.
- That soon?

26:53.006 --> 26:55.302
Maybe less, if he keeps jumping
through flaming hoops.

26:55.408 --> 26:57.201
My gosh, nature's running
its course on this guy.

26:57.306 --> 26:59.902
When we first found him,
he was trying to set his ribs.

27:00.007 --> 27:01.602
Well, he probably knows
his body won't hold out on him.

27:01.706 --> 27:05.203
So if you were trying to preserve
your body for as long as possible,
what would you do?

27:05.305 --> 27:08.900
I would get some kind of makeup.
Maybe the type a mortician would use.

27:09.005 --> 27:11.302
Cover up the appearance of dead skin.

27:11.407 --> 27:13.801
Ok. There's only one
mortuary in Grandview.

27:13.906 --> 27:15.601
Thanks.

27:15.706 --> 27:17.902
Jim?

27:32.405 --> 27:34.102
Hey, dead guy.

27:34.206 --> 27:36.303
Can I have my ring back?

27:36.407 --> 27:37.603
How's he been?

27:37.705 --> 27:41.403
Fine, once I restrained him.

27:41.706 --> 27:45.500
Is this really necessary?
I'm sorry, all right?

27:45.606 --> 27:47.203
Jason, we can't let you
go to that reunion.

27:47.308 --> 27:49.200
Why not?
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

27:49.307 --> 27:51.702
No, but you wanted to kiss that
Stephanie Hardwick, you know?

27:51.807 --> 27:53.702
The last thing on your list? Come on.

27:53.806 --> 27:59.303
I was never actually gonna do that.
That was... that was just a goof.

27:59.405 --> 28:02.802
I just wanted to go and enjoy myself.

28:02.906 --> 28:06.601
Ok, even if that's true, your body's
breaking down, and you're not Bryan.

28:06.706 --> 28:09.100
You lived your life, and you
can't steal somebody else's.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.300
I didn't steal it.

28:11.406 --> 28:15.201
He abandoned it.
There's a big difference.

28:15.307 --> 28:19.201
You've been haunting him
this whole time, haven't you?

28:19.306 --> 28:21.603
Not haunting, just...

28:21.707 --> 28:23.802
checking in.

28:23.908 --> 28:26.403
I was curious to see what
mr. Most Likely To Succeed

28:26.506 --> 28:30.102
was gonna do with his life
after he dropped out of college.

28:30.207 --> 28:32.901
Whoa. Back up.
He dropped out of college?

28:33.006 --> 28:38.402
- He barely made it through a semester.
Isn't that right, Bryan? - Shut up.

28:38.506 --> 28:42.000
You wanna tell her what happened
after graduation, or should I?

28:42.105 --> 28:43.303
Shut up.

28:43.405 --> 28:49.103
- You don't know what it was like.
- Well, actually, I... do.

28:49.305 --> 28:53.500
You see, life wasn't so kind
after senior year.

28:53.608 --> 28:57.602
College ball was a little tougher,
classes took a little bit more effort,

28:57.707 --> 29:01.803
Bryan just couldn't juggle it all
like he could when he was 17,

29:01.907 --> 29:03.401
and he ended up getting
cut from the team,

29:03.507 --> 29:06.601
eventually dropped out from the school,
and basically spent the last 10 years

29:06.705 --> 29:10.503
studying his life from
the bottom of the class.

29:10.605 --> 29:12.300
Is that true?

29:12.408 --> 29:14.601
I mean he coasted on charm for a while.

29:14.706 --> 29:20.002
He was always good with the girls,
but even that faded.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.200
It gets to a point where girls
really aren't interested in guy

29:22.308 --> 29:26.800
who can't keep a job
for longer than 6 months.

29:26.907 --> 29:29.502
I mean, even Stephanie,
the homecoming queen

29:29.607 --> 29:33.100
moved on,
got engaged to that, uh...

29:33.208 --> 29:34.900
that guy, uh, Rick.

29:35.006 --> 29:38.703
Second string on the football team.

29:38.806 --> 29:40.901
That wasn't fair.

29:41.007 --> 29:43.703
He didn't deserve her.

29:43.807 --> 29:46.601
I mean, how could I show up
at a reunion and...

29:46.705 --> 29:51.400
- I didn't have a choice.
- He ended up in a bar, alone.

29:51.505 --> 29:55.100
Trying to convince a complete stranger
to go to our reunion with him.

29:55.206 --> 29:57.901
Come on! You'll be doing me
this huge favor.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.502
No, look. I just met you.

29:59.606 --> 30:01.600
Look, please.

30:01.706 --> 30:05.401
Oh, god. Just leave me alone.

30:05.508 --> 30:09.600
What do you do when you realize
you peaked in high school?

30:09.707 --> 30:13.002
I mean when you got nothing to
live for, how do you talk to all

30:13.107 --> 30:16.501
those people and all they remember
is how you used to be?

30:16.606 --> 30:20.702
Do you face them like you
freeze yourself in time

30:20.807 --> 30:26.201
and leave nothing but a memory
and a good-looking corpse?

30:27.707 --> 30:29.902
No!

30:33.607 --> 30:37.300
You were too scared to live?

30:37.607 --> 30:39.900
It was too hard.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.402
All of it was just too hard.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.800
Oh, boo-hoo.

30:43.908 --> 30:47.500
Tell that to the kid who spent
his life in a wheelchair.

30:47.606 --> 30:50.802
Bryan, you told me that you
didn't have any unfinished business.

30:50.907 --> 30:55.000
This reunion is your
unfinished business.

30:55.106 --> 30:57.701
I can't...

30:58.006 --> 31:01.601
I can't walk in there
and just see all those people.

31:01.708 --> 31:03.202
And what?

31:03.305 --> 31:07.501
Face a difficult choice
for once in your life?

31:07.608 --> 31:13.400
I mean, do you realize what
I would have done with just... one?

31:14.206 --> 31:19.102
Just one of those chances
that you... threw away.

31:24.608 --> 31:27.003
Do you promise that you
won't harass Stephanie?

31:27.108 --> 31:30.203
I swear on my life.

31:31.105 --> 31:34.401
You konw what I mean.

31:35.106 --> 31:38.102
Cut Jason loose.

31:38.907 --> 31:40.901
- Uh, you sure about this?
- Yes, I am sure.

31:41.008 --> 31:42.802
It's the only way I'm gonna be
able to cross both of them over

31:42.906 --> 31:47.503
is to get both of them
back to the reunion.

31:47.807 --> 31:51.802
Let's go back to the high school.

31:58.808 --> 32:02.603
Are you sure this looks natural?
This foundation seems a little heavy.

32:02.708 --> 32:05.302
Jason, this is the least
of your problems, ok?

32:05.408 --> 32:08.903
Just stay out of direct light.
It'll make the makeup look better and...

32:09.006 --> 32:12.102
well, stop you from melting.

32:12.208 --> 32:13.802
Got it.

32:13.905 --> 32:15.303
And what about me?

32:15.406 --> 32:19.303
And what happens when everybody
asks me, "hey, man, you know."

32:19.405 --> 32:21.903
"What you been doing with
yourself the past 10 years"?

32:22.006 --> 32:23.300
I don't know.
Tell 'em the truth.

32:23.407 --> 32:26.203
Another guy is going to my
reunion in my body, Melinda.

32:26.305 --> 32:28.500
I think we're being a little loose
with the truth, don't you think?

32:28.605 --> 32:31.702
Ok, fine.
We'll make a deal.

32:31.808 --> 32:36.203
Jason goes in, he will say
and do exactly what you want.

32:36.308 --> 32:38.501
Trade-off is that you
have to be honest

32:38.607 --> 32:40.900
with your old friends
and even with yourself.

32:41.008 --> 32:43.901
- Deal?
- Deal.

32:45.508 --> 32:48.103
Fine, I'll do it.

32:48.206 --> 32:52.403
- But I won't enjoy it.
- Me neither.

33:19.607 --> 33:24.600
Hey, man, what you been doing
with yourself the last 10 years?

33:24.707 --> 33:27.202
I was a paramedic
for a couple of years.

33:27.306 --> 33:30.301
Paramedic? Cool.

33:31.005 --> 33:34.800
All right, this is not helping.

33:34.906 --> 33:37.401
Ok, guys.

33:37.806 --> 33:38.700
What?

33:38.807 --> 33:42.901
You lying about Bryan's past.
That was not part of our deal.

33:43.007 --> 33:45.103
Fine with me.
Really.

33:45.208 --> 33:48.200
Bryan had to tell the truth.
You didn't say anythinlg about me.

33:48.307 --> 33:50.400
Besides, you were the one
who was worried about anybody

33:50.505 --> 33:56.401
noticing a corpse in the midst.
I had to come up with some ali...

33:56.507 --> 33:59.903
There she is. Wow.
She hasn't changed a bit.

34:00.008 --> 34:01.403
Oh, god.

34:01.506 --> 34:03.000
This is it.

34:03.106 --> 34:05.602
I gotta go and say hi.

34:05.707 --> 34:07.400
No. Hold it.

34:07.506 --> 34:12.300
You made me a promise and so far,
you are batting zero on your word.

34:12.407 --> 34:16.301
Hey, talk.
That's all. I swear.

34:17.908 --> 34:20.502
Thank you.

34:20.606 --> 34:22.502
Bryan!

34:22.608 --> 34:26.103
- What's up, buddy?
- Oh, hey. Uh, Rick.

34:26.205 --> 34:28.101
So, what's been going on with you?

34:28.206 --> 34:29.402
Uh, not much.

34:29.505 --> 34:32.701
- I was, uh, I was just gonna say hi...
- Yeah, you know we're engaged now?

34:32.806 --> 34:35.302
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I read that.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.002
- Congratulations.
- God, that must kill you a little bit.

34:38.106 --> 34:40.302
'Cause you guys were so cute
as a couple, and then,

34:40.407 --> 34:42.800
the star quarterback
loses her to the backup.

34:42.908 --> 34:46.001
Ok, you know what? Maybe we should
go and talk to somebody else. Hello.

34:46.107 --> 34:49.603
No, you're not going anywhere.
This guy's a jealous punk.

34:49.706 --> 34:51.402
He always has been.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.902
So I heard you're a big,
heroic paramedic now.

34:54.005 --> 34:56.001
That is great.
I'm so happy for you.

34:56.106 --> 35:01.603
But that was after you blew
the big game against state, right?

35:01.706 --> 35:04.801
- Man, that was a long time ago.
Who cares? - I care.

35:04.907 --> 35:07.200
Because some things don't change.

35:07.307 --> 35:10.403
Like what coach used to tell us.
"You gotta want it."

35:10.508 --> 35:13.400
You still want it, Bryan?
Or did you give up?

35:13.507 --> 35:17.102
Ok, Jason, you're gonna
repeat everything I say.

35:17.205 --> 35:22.501
- We really don't have time for this.
- We made a deal.

35:23.208 --> 35:27.603
All right, here's what
you're gonna say.

35:28.008 --> 35:30.503
You're right, Rick. I did give up.

35:30.608 --> 35:34.800
And another day goes by right on
think about how much I wasted,

35:34.907 --> 35:40.403
how many opportunities I let
slip because I was too scared.

35:40.507 --> 35:44.500
But you come to the point where
you need to let your regrets go, too,

35:44.607 --> 35:47.100
or they take over your wife.

35:47.208 --> 35:48.203
I was lucky.

35:48.308 --> 35:51.402
I got that chance.

35:54.206 --> 35:57.300
Not everybody does.

36:00.105 --> 36:05.003
Also, 3 years ago,
I totally nailed your sister.

36:06.306 --> 36:08.602
Was that last part really necessary?

36:08.705 --> 36:11.602
Yeah. Did you see
the look on his face?

36:11.706 --> 36:15.400
Yeah, and he's pissed at me.

36:19.405 --> 36:23.200
Stay away from her, you loser.

36:28.706 --> 36:32.400
Why you gotta be such a jerk?

36:35.208 --> 36:39.501
Bryan! I'm so sorry about Rick.
Are you all right?

36:39.607 --> 36:42.600
I'm fine.
I'm just gonna go get cleaned up.

36:42.705 --> 36:45.200
You look great, bu the way.

36:45.305 --> 36:49.803
It's all right.
We are leaving right now.

36:53.607 --> 36:56.300
Just a little further, ok?

36:56.408 --> 36:57.502
What can we do?

36:57.608 --> 37:03.502
I don't know. We can't send him
to a hospital. He's already dead.

37:09.507 --> 37:11.703
This does not... feel good.

37:11.807 --> 37:14.001
This is all my fault.
Why can't I keep my mouth shut?

37:14.105 --> 37:16.303
Jason, you don't have a lot of time.

37:16.405 --> 37:18.200
Is there a message that you
want me to give to Stephanie?

37:18.308 --> 37:22.600
Anything that you want me to tell her?

37:24.607 --> 37:25.903
What's that light?

37:26.006 --> 37:30.200
No. No, Jason, you stay with me, ok?

37:30.405 --> 37:34.401
Jason, just stay with me, please?

37:52.906 --> 37:56.603
What are you guys looking at?

37:56.908 --> 37:58.603
You're here.

37:58.708 --> 38:01.502
Well, yeah, I'm here.

38:01.607 --> 38:04.600
I mean, I'm a ghost again,
but you know that. That's ok.

38:04.706 --> 38:06.701
Yeah, but I thought you were
going into the light.

38:06.805 --> 38:08.700
You said "what is that light?".

38:08.806 --> 38:12.303
Yeah, I think that was actually the,
uh, the streetlamp.

38:12.408 --> 38:16.202
Behind you, it was giving you a kind of a weird glow.

38:16.308 --> 38:18.803
It made you look like angel.

38:18.908 --> 38:23.101
- I'm glad you're back.
- Thank you.

38:23.506 --> 38:25.901
I do have one last favor.

38:26.005 --> 38:30.601
There is a girl I need
to get a message to.

38:37.608 --> 38:41.201
- How's Bryan?
- Oh, he's... he's fine.

38:41.306 --> 38:43.902
- Um, could I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.

38:44.006 --> 38:48.902
No problem. Maybe my
fiance's sobered up by now.

38:49.905 --> 38:53.401
So it turns out that
I have something to give you.

38:53.508 --> 38:56.203
What is it?

38:58.305 --> 39:00.903
Jason wrote this.

39:01.008 --> 39:03.600
It's his handwriting.

39:03.707 --> 39:06.300
How is this possible?

39:06.406 --> 39:09.303
It's a little hard to explain,
but the important thing is

39:09.407 --> 39:12.003
that Jason wanted you to have it.

39:12.108 --> 39:13.602
I don't deserve it.

39:13.707 --> 39:16.500
Jason is the one who
accomplished everything.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.202
I never did anything.

39:18.307 --> 39:21.201
- No, that's not true.
- That's not true.

39:21.308 --> 39:25.102
She looked at me and saw me...

39:26.708 --> 39:28.700
and not just a kid in a wheelchair.

39:28.805 --> 39:34.102
Do you remember how the really good
things that you said you saw in Jason?

39:34.207 --> 39:36.500
He felt that.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.803
He cherished it.

39:38.906 --> 39:45.200
And he wouldn't have been able to...
live as much if it weren't for you.

39:47.105 --> 39:49.302
Tell her to look at
the bottom of the list.

39:49.405 --> 39:54.503
Oh, yeah. You should look
at the bottom of the list.

40:06.807 --> 40:11.601
I wasn't even sure I wanted
to come to this reunion.

40:11.708 --> 40:14.303
Thank you.

40:19.305 --> 40:23.602
So... you guys ready to cross over now?

40:24.806 --> 40:28.502
Well, you know, they're about to
present awards next, maybe...

40:28.605 --> 40:33.501
maybe we'll get
"traveled furtherest to be here."

40:35.408 --> 40:37.703
Jeez.

40:39.908 --> 40:44.401
Are you as scared to go
into that as I am?

40:44.507 --> 40:46.800
Uh...

40:47.005 --> 40:49.302
yeah.

40:49.605 --> 40:51.401
You don't have to be scared.

40:51.507 --> 40:55.400
- But what if I don't get it right?
- Not possible.

40:55.507 --> 41:00.103
There's no way you could
get it wrong, so...

41:02.906 --> 41:05.100
Let's...

41:05.208 --> 41:08.101
let's go live a little.

41:08.206 --> 41:11.003
Let it all go.

41:29.706 --> 41:33.001
- So was Harold happy to have
his missing body back? - He was.

41:33.107 --> 41:35.902
And he didn't even ask why
dead guy was wearing suit.

41:36.007 --> 41:37.603
The estate sale worked out well.

41:37.708 --> 41:40.200
Hey, have you ever heard
of hair jewelry?

41:40.307 --> 41:44.303
Yeah, it's a little bit of a scam.

41:45.807 --> 41:48.100
What?

42:01.807 --> 42:04.300
If you won't go to coffee,
the coffee will come to you.

42:04.408 --> 42:07.801
He'll stay out there all day.
Believe me, he will.

42:07.907 --> 42:13.600
Yeah, maybe you should just
go out there and get it over with.

42:50.607 --> 42:54.803
