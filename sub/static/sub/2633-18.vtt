00:02.752 --> 00:03.794
Hey.

00:03.961 --> 00:07.923
I just got my teacher evaluations.
Check out what this one student wrote.

00:08.090 --> 00:12.344
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

00:12.512 --> 00:17.725
Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie
of the Paleontology Department."

00:19.227 --> 00:21.020
Ah, "Hotties of
the Paleontology Department."

00:21.187 --> 00:23.439
There's a big-selling calendar, huh?

00:24.858 --> 00:25.899
Who wrote it?

00:26.067 --> 00:28.652
I wish I knew,
but the evaluations are all anonymous.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.904
- Do you still have their final exams?
- Yeah.

00:31.114 --> 00:35.451
Match the evaluation to the exam with the
same handwriting and there's your admirer.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.080
A hot girl's at stake
and all of a sudden he's Rain Man.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.836
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Why are we so sure that this is a girl?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.508
It's a girl.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.428
Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?

00:54.596 --> 00:58.474
- Because I'm a teacher. She's a student.
- Oh, is that against the rules?

00:58.641 --> 01:00.267
- No, but it is frowned upon.
- I see.

01:00.435 --> 01:04.146
- Besides, there's a big age difference.
- Think of it like this. When you're 90...

01:04.313 --> 01:05.981
I know, when I'm 90, she'll be 80...

01:06.149 --> 01:08.317
...and it won't seem
like such a big difference.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.237
No, that's not what I was gonna say
at all.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.783
What I was gonna say is
when you're 90...

01:15.950 --> 01:19.620
...you'll still have the memory
of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.

01:59.994 --> 02:03.997
Chandler, you know that girl you went to
college with who became a movie director?

02:04.165 --> 02:07.543
Oh, yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.794
What's a movement class?

02:09.963 --> 02:13.340
It's Chandler's way
of pretending he didn't take mime.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.678
Listen, anyway,
she's directing the new Al Pacino movie.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.306
- You gotta get me an audition.
- Oh. I haven't talked to her in like 10 years.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.434
Oh, no, no, no. Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.813
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3400...

02:27.981 --> 02:31.650
Hey, hey, dude.
Why you changing the subject? What?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.736
- Will you make the call or what?
- Okay, I'll try.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.655
All right. Thanks, you're the best.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.075
The last day of auditions is Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.120
Just remember Thursday. Thursday.
Can you remember Thursday?

02:44.372 --> 02:45.539
Yeah, so Tuesday?

02:47.417 --> 02:51.336
Thursday. Look, if you need help
remembering, just think of it like this.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.381
The third day. All right?
Monday, one day.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.592
Tuesday, two day.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.470
Wednesday, when, huh, what day?
Thursday.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.223
The third day, okay?

03:04.475 --> 03:05.934
- Thank you.
- Okay.

03:07.812 --> 03:11.315
- Hey, Mon, I'm gonna check my messages.
- You just thought of that in there?

03:11.482 --> 03:14.359
Sure, you know, nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.363
Hello?

03:18.656 --> 03:19.907
Uh...

03:20.074 --> 03:21.283
Rachel.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.952
You guys, someone is in our apartment.
Call the cops.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.413
You're on the phone.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.582
- Oh, my God.
- What?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.835
Oh, my God. Thank you.
That was the Fire Department.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.464
- There was a fire at our place.
- Oh, my God. How bad was it?

03:35.632 --> 03:38.759
He didn't say, but it was a fire.
I'm guessing not very good.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.178
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Phoebe, come on.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.724
What are you smiling about?
What is so funny?

03:45.892 --> 03:50.479
The part I wanna audition for is a fireman.
This is so meant to be.

03:58.947 --> 04:03.450
Wow. Looks like you were very generous
with your grades this semester.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.625
- Professor Geller?
- Yeah? Huh?

04:12.377 --> 04:14.503
I wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your class.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.547
Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. Ow.

04:18.716 --> 04:22.219
I'm a little embarrassed about calling you
a hottie on my evaluation.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.638
- That was you?
- Yeah.

04:24.806 --> 04:28.558
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.604
But would you maybe wanna go out
with me sometime?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.983
Oh, I... Heh.
I don't think that would be the best idea.

04:36.150 --> 04:40.112
Oh, because I was thinking, um,
the semester's over.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.948
- You're not my teacher anymore.
- What time?

04:45.285 --> 04:49.371
Oh, you know what? Forget it.
I see you already gave me an A.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.959
- Gotcha.
- I'm kidding. Ha-ha-ha.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.711
- Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.213
So seriously, what time?

05:02.927 --> 05:05.762
Coming through. Oh.
Coming through. Oh. Hello. Hi.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.724
No, right. Coming through.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.684
- Oh.
- Okay. Well, it's not so bad.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.978
Most of the damage
was contained to the bedrooms.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.187
Oh, my God.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.566
Hey, buddy, you think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

05:18.443 --> 05:21.361
- Excuse me?
- Joey. He's working.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.031
You would look good in that.

05:25.199 --> 05:28.618
- Uh-oh. How bad is it?
- Oh, it's bad, it's really bad.

05:28.786 --> 05:34.416
The only thing that isn't burned is an ax,
which I do not remember buying.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.835
- How's your room, Rach?
- Everything's ruined.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.546
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite blue sweater.

05:39.714 --> 05:40.756
Isn't that mine?

05:41.841 --> 05:44.426
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.513
You're not gonna be able to live here
for a while.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.767
- You ladies have a place to stay?
- Oh. Wow.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.270
Okay, look, pal...

05:55.438 --> 05:58.398
...I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

05:58.566 --> 06:01.777
But if you give me your number,
I will call you some other time.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.490
Yes, they can stay with us.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.284
Have you figured out what started the fire,
Mr. Fireman?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.746
Well, uh, do either of you smoke?

06:12.914 --> 06:13.955
No, not usually.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.416
- But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks.
- No, no.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.837
- Do you light candles, burn incense?
- Yes, I do all the time. I love them.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.800
Oh, my God, I did it. It's me, it's me.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.719
I burned down the house.
I burned down the house!

06:27.887 --> 06:31.264
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

06:31.432 --> 06:34.059
I warned her about those candles.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.524
It's great to catch up.
I can't believe how long it's been.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.235
Hey, Chandler, is that?

06:45.530 --> 06:48.156
- Oh, that's great. Good for you.
- So, hey, hey, is it?

06:50.701 --> 06:53.829
Okay, so, yeah,
maybe we can get together, um...

06:59.877 --> 07:01.753
Can you hold on for one second, please?

07:02.213 --> 07:03.463
What?

07:03.631 --> 07:06.508
When you're off the phone,
you wanna get a pizza?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.927
Hi, I'm back.

07:09.470 --> 07:14.141
Yeah, that sounds great.
Okay, well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.105
Hey, listen, so when's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

07:21.566 --> 07:23.442
Hi. We didn't get to the audition.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.319
- I'm gonna take her to coffee and do it then.
- Ah.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.114
Wow, so now you're going on a date
with this girl?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.450
Not a date.
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

07:31.617 --> 07:35.245
You can't call somebody you haven't
talked to in 10 years and ask for a favor.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.914
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.332
You're right, I'm sorry.

07:39.500 --> 07:43.003
- It's not like you're going out with an ex.
- No, we only went out once.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.046
You dated her?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.716
Not once.

07:48.926 --> 07:53.346
Great. Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

07:53.514 --> 07:56.725
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.986
Oh. That's great.
My friend Joey's in the movie business.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.573
Mm. You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.576
- Hmm. My friend's name is Joey.
- Heh.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.162
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.625
Yeah, he calls me up
and asks me if he can edit my new movie.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.168
Heh. Can you believe that?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.087
You know,
I haven't spoken to him in, what, 10 years...

08:26.255 --> 08:29.090
...and he asks me for a favor?

08:31.469 --> 08:34.513
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.057
No "How you doing?" Heh.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.393
Man, I mean,
not even a cup of coffee first.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.395
- Heh. The nerve, huh?
- Yeah.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.938
Refill?

08:45.733 --> 08:48.485
Now, this is last-minute,
so I want to apologize for the mess.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.154
- Oh.
- Who cares?

08:53.783 --> 08:55.408
Oh, my God.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.786
It sure didn't look this way
when I lived here.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.412
I know.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.582
There's one problem, though.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.545
There's only room for one, so I guess
one of you will have to stay at Joey's.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.840
Well, since the fire was kind of my fault,
I guess you should get to stay here.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.384
Hey, hey, hey, now.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.679
This was no one's fault, Pheebs, okay?
It was an accident.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.973
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.475
Okay. Whoo!

09:20.643 --> 09:22.894
So, Rach,
you're the first guest at Hotel Monica.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.104
Hotel Monica.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.398
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.650
I thought I'd bring them to you,
you know, in bed.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.402
- Aw.
- You've been through so much.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.611
I have.

09:33.322 --> 09:36.408
This right here is where I keep the pizza.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.703
And that's where the napkin is.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.957
- What's that smell?
- I know. I don't...

09:47.253 --> 09:51.923
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

09:52.091 --> 09:56.386
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.596
Who?

09:57.763 --> 10:00.265
Oh. I had trouble
remembering everyone's names...

10:00.433 --> 10:01.891
...so I came up with nicknames.

10:02.059 --> 10:06.271
Like the guy on the other side of you
was Smelly von Brown-Shirt.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.524
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

10:09.692 --> 10:14.321
- So, um, did you have a nickname for me?
- Uh, no. No.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.406
Yes, you did. What was it?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.200
Um, it's...

10:19.368 --> 10:20.869
Cutie McPretty.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.873
Oh, that's so sweet.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.376
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

10:28.586 --> 10:32.505
You know how you said it might be weird,
the whole student-teacher thing?

10:32.673 --> 10:38.011
And to be frank, I thought it would be too.
But it's not. I mean, it's not at all.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.434
- Dr. Geller.
- Burt.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.272
So did you sleep well last night?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.482
- I did.
- Yeah?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.985
I did. Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.488
- Know what Joey left on my pillow?
- What?

10:56.656 --> 10:57.864
Gum.

10:58.532 --> 11:04.287
- Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
- Yeah, I know. It was my candle, my candle.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.207
No, there was an appliance left on
in the bathroom.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.875
It looks like a curling iron.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.544
- I don't use a curling iron.
- Well, someone does.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.674
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.552
- It could've been a hair-straightener.
- Oh.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.099
This is where I keep the pizza.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.143
And... Hey, where'd the napkin go?

11:35.111 --> 11:38.071
There you go. I wouldn't want
my best guest to strain her eyes.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.865
Thanks, Monica.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.702
- Does that smell bother you?
- What, the smell from Joey's?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.745
No, I can hardly smell it over here.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.917
Well, you let me know if you can.
Because I can bake a pie to cover it.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.921
- I can smell it a little. Bake the pie.
- Okay.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.427
Hello?

12:00.594 --> 12:03.471
Oh, yes, one minute, please.
It's for you. It's the fire inspector.

12:03.639 --> 12:07.642
Oh. Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.852
Really?

12:09.019 --> 12:12.814
Yeah, so it turns
out that it wasn't the hair-straightener...

12:12.982 --> 12:14.899
...that started the fire.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.402
No, no. It was the candles.

12:17.570 --> 12:21.072
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.910
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is...

12:26.120 --> 12:27.412
Uh...

12:30.207 --> 12:32.417
Uh, okay, well, I have to go now.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.383
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.553
I thought the age difference
might be a problem, but it wasn't.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.931
It wasn't at all.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.689
A concept lost on some people.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.524
So it's okay to date a student?

12:56.692 --> 12:57.859
Well, not really.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.779
I mean, technically,
it's not against the rules or anything.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.197
But it is frowned upon...

13:02.364 --> 13:04.866
...especially by that professor
we ran into last night.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.951
Judgy von Holier-Than-Thou.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.080
Just be careful, okay?

13:11.248 --> 13:15.001
You don't wanna get a reputation
as Professor McNails-His-Students. Ha, ha.

13:17.963 --> 13:21.382
- Yeah. What should I do?
- Well, Ross, it seems pretty clear.

13:21.550 --> 13:25.094
I mean, what's more important,
what people think or how you feel? Huh?

13:25.262 --> 13:28.515
- Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
- Joey, that is so sweet.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.314
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. So how'd it go with Dana?

13:36.482 --> 13:40.235
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open, say, Thursday?

13:40.402 --> 13:42.821
- I couldn't do it.
- You couldn't do it?

13:42.988 --> 13:45.448
Relax, I just need more time.
We're going to dinner.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.492
What? You're going out with her again?

13:49.328 --> 13:52.413
- Going out with who?
- Dana Keystone, from college.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.708
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she, uh, mm?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.461
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.548
- Oh.
- Ah.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.300
- Joey, you didn't even know her.
- Yeah, whatever.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.390
Great story again.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.433
The yarns that you weave.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.019
Ha-ha-ha. Woo-hoo!

14:15.479 --> 14:18.523
You know, uh, actually,
I should get going.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.859
Oh, no, no, no, stay, stay,
because you should...

14:21.026 --> 14:22.777
You should stay.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.613
Wow.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.616
Oh, I am really flattered.

14:28.784 --> 14:33.204
But I just...
I don't feel that way about you.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.333
- Oh, no, no, no. That's not... No, no, no.
- I'm sorry, Chandler.

14:37.501 --> 14:42.130
You know, you are such a sweet guy,
and I don't wanna hurt you.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.508
Oh, I wish there were something I could do
to make you feel better.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.177
No, no, no... Really?

14:48.345 --> 14:49.596
Of course.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.433
Well, it just hurts so bad, I, uh...

14:53.601 --> 14:55.852
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:56.020 --> 15:00.398
- Well, maybe there is one thing you can do.
- What? Anything. Anything.

15:01.150 --> 15:05.069
Well, I mean, this is just off the top
of my head now. Um...

15:05.237 --> 15:08.448
Ahem. But I have this friend, uh,
this actor friend...

15:08.616 --> 15:12.535
...and he would kill me
if he knew that I was doing this, um...

15:13.954 --> 15:18.207
...but, um, would it be possible for him
to get an audition for your movie...

15:18.375 --> 15:20.376
...say, on Thursday?

15:21.295 --> 15:22.921
Absolutely.

15:23.088 --> 15:27.175
But you'd really feel better
about me rejecting you...

15:27.343 --> 15:29.510
...if your friend can audition
for my movie?

15:29.678 --> 15:32.847
Well, the heart wants what it wants.
I'll see you later.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.648
Hey. How's it going?

15:41.815 --> 15:43.858
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.278
Yes, it has. I made cookies.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.448
That's all right. I'm still full
from your homemade potato chips, so...

15:50.616 --> 15:54.994
Oh. But you should eat them now
because they're hot from the oven.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.040
- Okay.
- Oh. But not in here.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.876
Can't eat them in bed, remember?
No crummies.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.211
Oh.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.296
I'll be out in a second.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.923
Okay.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.725
- What are you doing?
- This doesn't lock, does it?

16:23.732 --> 16:28.403
- Oh. Joey, sorry. Oh.
- Oh, it's all right, don't worry about it.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.072
No, but look.
Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.284
Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.413
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.501
- Huh.
- Yeah.

16:43.752 --> 16:47.296
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.758
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.803
All right, well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.854
What do you wanna do now, huh?
You wanna go get a drink?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.146
Uh, I can't.

17:04.314 --> 17:08.776
- Oh, you have some studying to do?
- No, I have some turning 21 to do.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.403
Okay. Ha, ha.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.531
You know, I remember
when I was in college, we used to...

17:16.910 --> 17:18.786
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, I'm just...

17:18.954 --> 17:21.873
I'm so comfortable with you.

17:24.917 --> 17:27.170
- Do you not wanna be seen with me?
- What?

17:27.337 --> 17:29.714
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

17:31.258 --> 17:34.093
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.263
What? No, no, wait, wait.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.933
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

17:41.101 --> 17:45.605
I mean, we like each other, right?
There's nothing wrong with that.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.774
Come on.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.405
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.117
- This is Elizabeth.
- Hi.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.787
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?

18:00.954 --> 18:03.456
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth here is a student.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.333
And we're dating.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.502
And you may frown upon that...

18:07.669 --> 18:11.464
...but we're not gonna hide it anymore.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.134
You are so fired.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.554
- What?
- They're gonna fire you.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.307
You can't date a student.
It's against the rules.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.268
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

18:27.064 --> 18:28.773
- Oh. Ah.
- Ah!

18:28.941 --> 18:31.484
I love it at Joey's.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.194
There you go.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.739
- Ooh. Thanks.
- Nice.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.992
- So you busy Thursday?
- Oh, very funny.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.496
I don't know if you remember, but my
audition was supposed to be Thursday.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.251
You got me the audition?

18:48.418 --> 18:50.086
- Yeah.
- Oh, let's hug it up.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.713
Okay, okay, okay.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.383
What are you gonna do to me
if you get the part?

18:56.426 --> 18:57.468
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.678
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.847
- Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.
Uh-huh.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.183
Now, I know that they said
that the hair-straightener started the fire...

19:04.351 --> 19:06.435
...but I think I'm partly at fault.

19:06.645 --> 19:12.066
You see, I didn't tell you,
but, um, I had recently refilled the tissues.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.069
And so, you know,
let's face it, that's just kindling.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.322
So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.117
No, no, no, Phoebe, this was my fault.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.120
- Besides, you know what? I'm fine here.
- Okay.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.498
- Oh, Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
- Really?

19:27.666 --> 19:31.961
- Yeah, she said something about crummies.
- No, no, no. I was so careful.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.716
Okay. You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

19:36.884 --> 19:40.803
That's right.
All the ladies wanna stay at Joey's.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.390
No, Phoebe, come on,
I don't wanna switch.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.310
Please. Come on,
I can throw wet paper towels here.

19:47.477 --> 19:51.522
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.193
I know. I'm sorry.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.070
All right, fine.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.656
- This looks like so much fun.
- Ha, ha.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.159
God, what a mess.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.792
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.589
I can't date you
or have a hot plate in my office.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.886
Oh, I can't believe
we have to stop seeing each other.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.807
For what it's worth,
I did appreciate you standing up for me.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.894
That felt really nice.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.480
Kind of made me like you even more.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.817
I know, I know. I really like you too.
But we can't date.

20:36.985 --> 20:39.403
It's against the rules. It's forbidden.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.906
Wow.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.866
- What?
- Just hearing you describe it...

20:44.034 --> 20:49.247
...as forbidden, it's really hot.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.416
Really?

20:52.626 --> 20:54.418
Yeah.

20:55.128 --> 20:59.590
Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's, uh...
It's wrong.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.221
- Stop it.
- No, no. It's wrong. It's...

21:05.389 --> 21:07.348
It's naughty.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.809
It's...

21:10.269 --> 21:11.769
...taboo.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.355
Shut the book.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.318
- Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.
- Oh.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.909
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.745
- So?
- So?

21:29.913 --> 21:33.165
- It's Thursday. How was the audition?
- It's Thur...?

21:33.333 --> 21:36.168
Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day.
Wednesday, when, huh, what day? Thur...

21:38.964 --> 21:40.214
Oh!
